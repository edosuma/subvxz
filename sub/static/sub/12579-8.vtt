00:34.881 --> 00:38.578
Now, I've cleared a space 12 by 8 by 14...

00:38.685 --> 00:40.676
to hide Bobby's Christmas present.

00:40.787 --> 00:44.553
So, when we're at the store,
keep an eye out for a gift that size.

00:44.658 --> 00:48.754
Last Christmas, I hid Joseph's gift so well
I still haven't found it.

00:49.930 --> 00:51.659
Cutest little puppy.

00:52.299 --> 00:54.824
Or should I say dog?

00:54.935 --> 00:58.496
Yeah, nothing like the face of a child
on Christmas morning.

00:59.006 --> 01:02.305
- What's it like?
- It's the single greatest thing on earth.

01:02.409 --> 01:05.378
That is, except for
all the hundreds of special moments...

01:05.479 --> 01:08.039
that any dad shares with his child.

01:08.148 --> 01:09.376
Sounds nice.

01:10.951 --> 01:15.479
I guess I'll just go home all by myself
and eat a pot pie.

01:15.789 --> 01:17.984
- Today is turkey.
- See you.

01:19.593 --> 01:20.617
Hey, Bill.

01:20.727 --> 01:23.252
You know,
I've got some errands to run today.

01:23.397 --> 01:26.889
Going to the post office.
Why don't you come along?

01:27.367 --> 01:30.302
Come on, it'll be fun.
You can take a $5 bill...

01:30.404 --> 01:34.135
and put it in the change machine,
pretend you're in Las Vegas.

01:34.408 --> 01:35.670
Ka-ching!

01:38.111 --> 01:40.306
[Whooping] Look at all that mail.

01:40.414 --> 01:43.383
I haven't gotten so much as a letter
in six weeks.

01:43.483 --> 01:45.348
Well, it's a busy time of year.

01:45.452 --> 01:48.717
They're probably just backed up,
or maybe they lost it.

01:48.822 --> 01:50.221
Yeah, you're right.

01:51.491 --> 01:55.518
My name is Bill Dauterive,
and apparently you have lost my mail.

01:55.896 --> 01:57.761
I'll check in the back.

02:04.104 --> 02:08.006
Look, about my friend's lost mail,
you're not gonna find it.

02:08.108 --> 02:11.373
I know that.
We just walk to the back for show.

02:12.312 --> 02:15.770
You know, you may want to
check William Dauterive, too.

02:15.882 --> 02:17.645
Bill is short for William.

02:17.751 --> 02:20.311
If you want mail,
we've got these bags in the corner.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.149
Those are letters
addressed to Santa Claus.

02:22.255 --> 02:24.723
We're always looking for volunteers
to take one or two...

02:24.825 --> 02:27.350
and buy a gift to make a needy kid happy.

02:27.461 --> 02:30.555
What a great idea.
I think I'll take one myself.

02:30.664 --> 02:33.690
How about you, Bill?
You'd make a great Santa.

02:34.334 --> 02:36.325
And that's not a fat joke.

02:36.937 --> 02:38.666
You really think so?

02:44.945 --> 02:48.403
- This guy seems a little off.
- Bill's great with kids.

02:48.515 --> 02:51.882
It's adults and holidays
he seems to have a problem with.

02:55.555 --> 02:57.989
Has anyone seen
where I put my Scotch tape?

02:58.091 --> 03:00.252
Did you check under my chin?

03:01.762 --> 03:05.630
You know, you fall for Dale's beard of tape
every year, Peggy.

03:05.799 --> 03:09.166
Yes. Yes, I do.
And I'm always a good sport about it.

03:09.269 --> 03:11.396
My first wrapping party.

03:11.505 --> 03:12.472
[Exclaims]

03:12.672 --> 03:15.539
I just cut my finger. Deep.

03:16.009 --> 03:19.240
Well, it doesn't compare
to the pain of previous years...

03:19.346 --> 03:22.042
when I didn't have any kids to wrap for.

03:24.851 --> 03:28.685
Matthew said he likes music,
so I got him a trombone.

03:28.789 --> 03:31.553
I can't wait to see
the expression on his face.

03:31.658 --> 03:34.627
You don't give the gifts yourself.
You buy them, you wrap them...

03:34.728 --> 03:38.459
then we mail them
and put the return address as North Pole.

03:40.333 --> 03:43.029
Does the mailman at least dress as Santa?

03:43.136 --> 03:44.603
- No.
- He doesn't?

03:44.704 --> 03:47.195
Every kid should get to see Santa.

03:53.079 --> 03:57.277
Oh, my God. It's snowing!

03:58.418 --> 04:00.716
- Wow!
- What the...

04:00.821 --> 04:05.281
- You know, Peggy, it is snowing.
- That is not snow. It's 64 degrees.

04:06.626 --> 04:08.992
That is the foam
that they spray on runways...

04:09.095 --> 04:11.563
when jumbo jets are about to crash.

04:11.832 --> 04:13.527
Bobby! Get in here!

04:18.271 --> 04:19.567
[Children laughing]

04:24.578 --> 04:27.513
Now, are you going to open this
before Christmas?

04:27.614 --> 04:31.573
- No, sir.
- Good. You're a very good boy.

04:31.685 --> 04:33.312
Open it.

04:35.789 --> 04:37.279
Thank you, Santa.

04:37.724 --> 04:41.091
The kids haven't had a real Christmas
since their father left.

04:41.761 --> 04:43.558
Can I pay you for these things?

04:43.663 --> 04:47.099
No, what would Santa need money for?

04:47.200 --> 04:50.101
My elves make all the toys.

04:50.203 --> 04:51.500
I mean...

04:51.638 --> 04:52.605
Ho, ho, ho.

04:54.608 --> 04:58.704
Rented snow machines, all these lights.
It's like a carnival.

04:58.812 --> 05:01.246
I wonder how Jesus feels about this.

05:01.348 --> 05:03.976
It's Christmas, and Bill's happy.

05:04.084 --> 05:07.611
I'll tell you how Jesus feels: Great.

05:09.322 --> 05:10.653
HANK: Hey, this is perfect.

05:10.757 --> 05:12.748
Tomorrow Christmas service falls...

05:12.859 --> 05:16.522
right between the Aloha Bowl
and the Oahu Bowl.

05:16.630 --> 05:20.327
And we can top the whole day off
with the Christmas Smackdown.

05:20.433 --> 05:24.062
Christmas Smackdown. Here it is.

05:24.170 --> 05:28.197
Hey, Dennis Rodman
is gonna be a guest referee.

05:28.308 --> 05:32.142
Boy, you know that guy's
catching a folding chair to the head.

05:32.913 --> 05:35.177
- The worm.
- Wait a second.

05:35.282 --> 05:38.274
Sorry, Bobby. It's rated TV-14.

05:38.385 --> 05:41.354
The last time I checked, you were still 13.

05:41.454 --> 05:44.355
Come on, Dad. I tell you what.

05:44.457 --> 05:48.587
I'll just close my eyes
when things get too colorful.

05:49.029 --> 05:51.862
Nice try, mister,
but I've seen the way you watch TV.

05:51.965 --> 05:53.557
You never blink.

05:54.768 --> 05:55.962
[Car horns blaring]

05:57.671 --> 05:59.298
BILL: Merry Christmas!

06:00.106 --> 06:01.630
[Singing popular Christmas carol]

06:02.509 --> 06:04.136
Better hum, Dad.

06:04.244 --> 06:08.271
It won't feel like Christmas Day
if we miss The Little Drummer Boy.

06:08.381 --> 06:12.977
I'm doing the best I can.
Wait a minute, you're being sarcastic.

06:13.086 --> 06:17.853
You don't have any interest in seeing
that little boy play his heart out, do you?

06:17.958 --> 06:19.016
Nope.

06:20.994 --> 06:23.224
Valet parking is $5.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.924
Valet of the Dales is not responsible
for lost or stolen article...

06:26.032 --> 06:29.695
- Dale, I'm just gonna park in my driveway.
- That lot's full...

06:29.803 --> 06:34.001
but Bill says I can put overflow parking
poolside at Luanne's house.

06:34.107 --> 06:35.802
Arcadio!

06:35.909 --> 06:38.935
La bamba Le automobile-o.

06:39.045 --> 06:42.105
No scratch-o! Comprende?

06:42.649 --> 06:45.846
- Out of the way.
- Hey, you're back.

06:47.387 --> 06:51.187
I have got to find some way
to thank you for everything.

06:51.558 --> 06:56.495
- Does Santa like chicken?
- Fried, jerked, broiled or boiled.

06:57.764 --> 07:02.258
After the holidays, I'm gonna cook you
a homemade chicken dinner.

07:02.502 --> 07:07.303
- And will you eat it with me, too?
- Bill, I could just wrap you up.

07:16.282 --> 07:17.772
Ho, ho, ho!

07:19.586 --> 07:22.214
And she made the date with him?

07:22.322 --> 07:24.847
Yep. They're gonna have chicken.

07:24.958 --> 07:28.052
Well, I suppose
we can suffer through this racket...

07:28.161 --> 07:32.063
if it means Bill will be spending time
with a woman who knows he's there.

07:32.165 --> 07:35.828
Yeah, and it's just till New Year's,
then it all comes down.

07:36.503 --> 07:37.629
You know what?

07:37.737 --> 07:41.070
We can just pretend
that all that noise is the ocean.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.837
Yes, it's working.

07:49.482 --> 07:52.007
Looks like it's gonna be a great new year.

07:52.118 --> 07:54.609
Notre Dame lost,
Bill had a great Christmas...

07:54.721 --> 07:56.780
and now he's taking down
his decorations...

07:56.890 --> 07:59.120
instead of trying to
hang himself with them.

07:59.225 --> 08:03.457
Looks like he hired professionals,
or very dedicated amateurs.

08:09.669 --> 08:11.000
What the...

08:14.374 --> 08:18.333
They start the Christmas season
earlier and earlier each year.

08:19.145 --> 08:20.407
[Bill exclaiming excitedly]

08:28.521 --> 08:32.048
Hey, guys, take off your shoes.
Come on in.

08:33.159 --> 08:36.924
I tell you, January's the month
to rent a Santa Bounce House.

08:37.030 --> 08:40.760
- I got a hell of a deal.
- Come on, how about taking all this down?

08:40.866 --> 08:43.392
Yeah. Yeah, that's a great idea. I'll help.

08:43.503 --> 08:46.438
No, no, I can't take down Santa's Village.

08:46.539 --> 08:48.598
You see how happy those kids are?

08:49.509 --> 08:51.204
Well, they do like jumping.

08:51.311 --> 08:53.745
Yeah, and someone
I have a lot of respect for...

08:53.847 --> 08:57.214
once told me
that Christmas is about giving and love.

08:57.317 --> 09:00.775
Yeah, we all got
Boomhauer's Christmas card, too...

09:00.887 --> 09:02.946
last month, in December, but...

09:03.056 --> 09:06.651
Hank, there'll be plenty of time
for these kids to be beaten down by life.

09:06.759 --> 09:09.421
But if I can help bring
a little extra joy and love...

09:09.529 --> 09:12.157
into their world now, shouldn't I?

09:13.133 --> 09:15.124
Why do you hate love, Hank?

09:18.972 --> 09:22.430
Well, so much for
my New Year's resolution.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.636
Who says a mustache has to go
across the whole lip?

09:25.745 --> 09:27.645
BILL: Ho, ho, ho!

09:27.881 --> 09:30.907
Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

09:31.017 --> 09:35.215
Hey, why don't you kids celebrate
by taking a spin in my bounce house?

09:35.455 --> 09:40.358
Have you been talking to my dad?
Well, guess what? We're not little kids.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.554
We don't jump in bouncy houses.

09:52.105 --> 09:53.072
Oh, dear.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.435
Hey, you're right on time.

09:59.279 --> 10:02.442
- You're still doing this.
- Yeah, just around the house.

10:02.549 --> 10:05.484
They won't let me on the Army base
like this anymore.

10:06.219 --> 10:10.485
So, where are the kids?
Sam and Emma, right?

10:10.590 --> 10:13.115
I got a baby-sitter. I thought we might...

10:13.226 --> 10:17.458
Hey, mind if I knock off early?
I don't think any kids are coming by today.

10:17.597 --> 10:20.691
Okay.
See you tomorrow morning, 9:00 sharp.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.998
That's the Arlen midget.
He comes with the bounce house.

10:25.205 --> 10:26.502
Shall we?

10:26.606 --> 10:28.574
You know,
why don't you enjoy the chicken?

10:28.675 --> 10:31.337
- You can just keep the dish.
- Yeah, but you and the kids...

10:31.444 --> 10:34.106
are still coming over Sunday night
for haircuts, right?

10:34.214 --> 10:37.183
- I like their hair long.
- But...

10:42.822 --> 10:45.518
- No!
- You should have used cold water.

10:45.658 --> 10:48.650
Yeah, but that doesn't get
enough of the stains out.

10:49.095 --> 10:51.325
Hi, I'm the Milton Street Santa.

10:51.431 --> 10:55.765
I'm Wally. Hey, Santa?
Can you lend me $2 for the dryer?

10:56.002 --> 10:57.401
Sure. Which one's yours?

10:57.503 --> 11:00.131
I got them soaking at a place
a few blocks away.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.209
But nobody there had the Christmas spirit,
if you know what I mean.

11:03.309 --> 11:04.776
Of course I do.

11:04.877 --> 11:07.345
I got a lot of blue jeans in there.

11:07.814 --> 11:09.975
You ever wear wet blue jeans?

11:11.985 --> 11:14.545
Man, this is the best Christmas ever.

11:24.564 --> 11:29.092
Bill, why don't you take Marilyn out
someplace nice for Valentine's Day?

11:29.202 --> 11:33.002
Women like Valentine's Day.
They find it romantic.

11:33.373 --> 11:34.863
Marilyn's gone.

11:36.643 --> 11:38.235
Of course she is.

11:39.712 --> 11:40.974
You know, Bill...

11:41.080 --> 11:44.982
even Troy Aikman takes off his uniform
after the Superbowl.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.642
How do you know?

11:49.856 --> 11:51.118
[People laughing]

11:55.962 --> 11:57.486
WALLY: Do that outside.

11:58.665 --> 12:01.225
Sam? Emma?

12:02.535 --> 12:05.595
Hey, Santa, remember me? It's Wally.

12:06.039 --> 12:09.099
- The little boy from the laundromat.
- What are you doing here?

12:09.208 --> 12:10.937
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

12:11.044 --> 12:13.911
I told my buddies how cool you were
and they all had to meet you.

12:14.013 --> 12:17.574
- Yeah, can we have some money?
- He means candy canes.

12:17.817 --> 12:19.114
I'm out of canes...

12:19.218 --> 12:23.052
but I still have 10 pounds
of Rice Krispie treats shaped like reindeer.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.522
What the...

12:32.031 --> 12:33.225
Now, who...

12:34.267 --> 12:35.598
"Heineken"?

12:37.837 --> 12:38.895
Nice pool.

12:39.005 --> 12:41.530
What say we jump in, see what floats?

12:41.641 --> 12:44.542
Just take your beer cans off of my lawn.

12:45.244 --> 12:48.270
And quit trying to read my t-shirt.

12:52.185 --> 12:53.516
You lose something over here?

12:53.619 --> 12:57.020
I am making a citizen's arrest
for trespassing.

12:57.123 --> 13:00.752
- I don't think so.
- Believe me, I've done it before.

13:02.528 --> 13:05.088
How did you get Bill's key chain?

13:05.198 --> 13:08.998
- Okay, you're under arrest for theft, too.
- He gave it to me.

13:09.202 --> 13:12.399
Now, get off our property
or I'll citizen-arrest you.

13:12.505 --> 13:15.804
- Damn it! When Bill comes home...
- "When Bill comes home."

13:15.908 --> 13:19.105
- What the hell are you doing?
- "What the hell..."

13:25.318 --> 13:28.685
The thing is, I did something today.

13:28.788 --> 13:30.585
What is it, Wally?

13:30.690 --> 13:34.717
Well, I bought you a gift. It's a belt sander.

13:36.195 --> 13:38.993
- There's something else.
- What?

13:39.098 --> 13:42.829
You can tell me. You can tell me anything.

13:43.302 --> 13:46.169
I kind of lied
to the guy at the hardware store.

13:46.773 --> 13:49.367
I told him I was getting this for my dad.

13:50.376 --> 13:51.570
Here.

13:59.819 --> 14:03.255
You could make a Japanese rock garden
where that tire mark is.

14:03.356 --> 14:06.382
I know a Japanese guy
who might have some rocks.

14:06.492 --> 14:07.459
[Bill laughing]

14:08.094 --> 14:09.425
Hey, guys.

14:09.529 --> 14:13.260
We were just at the grocery store
and Wally did the cutest thing.

14:13.366 --> 14:16.767
What'd he do?
Did he ride a unicycle? Did he juggle?

14:16.869 --> 14:20.396
Did he find an adorable way
to peel out on my lawn?

14:20.506 --> 14:21.666
No, Hank.

14:21.774 --> 14:26.438
I'm not saying my Wally isn't a handful,
but I like a kid with spirit.

14:26.579 --> 14:29.480
And as for your lawn,
it's my responsibility...

14:29.582 --> 14:33.040
and I will re-sod the damaged area.
Fair enough?

14:33.386 --> 14:34.512
Fair enough.

14:36.422 --> 14:39.220
- Senator Edward...
- He blocked the channel guide.

14:39.325 --> 14:41.520
Now I don't even know what I'm missing.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.254
- Senator Feingold.
- Aye.

14:43.362 --> 14:44.454
Senator Feinstein.

14:45.331 --> 14:48.494
My dad is pushing
every one of my buttons.

14:56.042 --> 14:59.978
I believe you guys are first-time callers,
so I'm only gonna charge you $1.

15:00.079 --> 15:01.307
For what?

15:01.981 --> 15:02.948
Beer.

15:03.316 --> 15:04.578
We better go.

15:04.684 --> 15:08.142
Why? Because beer's not TV-14?

15:08.721 --> 15:10.518
Set me up, my man.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.458
What's the matter?
Forty ounces for $1 is a good deal.

15:16.562 --> 15:20.293
Oh, yeah. I just usually drink 30-ouncers...

15:20.399 --> 15:23.027
but, hey, it's the weekend.

15:26.806 --> 15:28.535
Hey, come here.

15:28.641 --> 15:30.575
Just think, Connie girl...

15:30.676 --> 15:33.736
when we're grown-ups and marrieds...

15:33.846 --> 15:36.747
we'll get to do this every night!

15:36.849 --> 15:39.545
Yeah, I want a house just like this...

15:39.919 --> 15:43.047
with soft floors and plastic windows.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.156
Look at the stars.

15:45.958 --> 15:50.190
There's, well, so many of them.

15:50.296 --> 15:52.491
BOBBY: Yeah.
CONNIE: Cool.

15:53.199 --> 15:55.360
You know the best way to sober up?

15:55.468 --> 15:58.130
Bounce around a lot.
Get it out of your system.

16:05.811 --> 16:07.005
Bobby?

16:07.113 --> 16:10.549
Hey, Dad! I like beer!

16:18.925 --> 16:22.486
You, you, and you, go home now!

16:27.600 --> 16:30.262
You get the hell out of here.

16:31.938 --> 16:32.962
That does it!

16:33.072 --> 16:35.973
I've had about enough
of this Christmas crap. Bill!

16:36.075 --> 16:37.167
Dang it, Bill!

16:37.276 --> 16:40.074
Some of us are trying to raise kids
in this neighborhood.

16:40.179 --> 16:41.271
Good kids...

16:41.380 --> 16:44.543
the kind that don't try
to kill their parents in their sleep.

16:44.650 --> 16:45.947
Kids like Bobby.

16:46.052 --> 16:48.452
Wally would never kill me. He told me so.

16:48.554 --> 16:50.522
That kind of communication
is very important...

16:50.623 --> 16:53.285
- in a father-son style relationship.
- What?

16:55.227 --> 16:58.594
- Is that my belt sander?
- No, it's mine.

16:58.898 --> 17:01.958
Wally bought it
and gave it to me as a present.

17:03.903 --> 17:06.997
Yeah? Then why does it have
the same serial number...

17:07.106 --> 17:08.835
as my warranty card?

17:16.549 --> 17:19.040
I know there are two sides
to every story...

17:19.151 --> 17:22.984
but Hank was bragging about
his new belt sander all last week.

17:23.089 --> 17:25.079
Where do you think I got the idea?

17:25.191 --> 17:28.319
That egg was strutting around
showing off his fancy belt sander...

17:28.426 --> 17:31.863
and I thought,
"Hey, Bill's a better man than this ass.

17:31.964 --> 17:35.161
"He should have a belt sander."
So I bought you one.

17:37.703 --> 17:41.469
Yeah, it's just...
You know, Hank had the warranty card.

17:43.009 --> 17:46.740
So, this is how it's gonna be.
Hank: Good, Wally: Bad.

17:46.846 --> 17:48.279
I'm not saying that.

17:48.381 --> 17:51.111
But maybe it wasn't such a good idea,
giving...

17:51.217 --> 17:53.879
Well, selling beer to kids.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.986
Wow, you really are like my dad.

17:57.356 --> 17:58.880
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:59.225 --> 18:03.161
He never had faith in me either.
But at least he had a motorcycle.

18:03.562 --> 18:06.554
Wally,
building a strong relationship isn't easy.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.100
- We can work through this.
- I don't like work.

18:16.542 --> 18:19.943
I did 10 sit-ups and I tried to do a push-up.

18:20.346 --> 18:22.371
Can I go back to sleep now?

18:22.481 --> 18:24.972
You had a chance to sleep last night,
mister...

18:25.084 --> 18:27.644
but you decided to go partying instead.

18:27.753 --> 18:30.483
Now, get a rag
and start washing windows.

18:34.493 --> 18:36.825
I almost hated waking him this morning.

18:36.929 --> 18:40.296
But then he tried to tell me that
his hangover was punishment enough...

18:40.399 --> 18:42.492
so I flipped him off his mattress.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.398
Wally left last night!

18:45.471 --> 18:47.132
And it's all your fault.

18:47.239 --> 18:50.675
- You broke my family.
- Wally was not your family.

18:50.776 --> 18:54.735
My God, I've thrown out propane tanks
that would make a better son than Wally.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.542
But he's all I had!

18:57.750 --> 19:01.049
Oh, poor Bill.
He probably shouldn't be alone.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.910
But he will be.

19:06.392 --> 19:10.419
Wait, I've got it! Bill wants to have a child.

19:11.097 --> 19:14.123
And Hank's urethra is too narrow
to have another child.

19:14.233 --> 19:18.897
Ergo, Bill should inseminate Peggy.
Everybody's happy.

19:19.472 --> 19:20.439
Ow!

19:21.407 --> 19:22.806
Didn't hurt.

19:25.778 --> 19:26.745
Nancy.

19:33.419 --> 19:34.386
[Phone ringing]

19:36.489 --> 19:37.456
What?

19:39.125 --> 19:40.353
Where are you?

19:43.162 --> 19:44.959
I got a call from Wally.

19:45.498 --> 19:47.125
Where is he? Jail?

19:47.233 --> 19:49.633
Yes. Some trumped-up charge.

19:49.735 --> 19:52.863
He can't survive in jail.
You've gotta help me bail him out.

19:52.972 --> 19:53.996
No way.

19:54.106 --> 19:56.233
Things got out of hand in the first place...

19:56.342 --> 19:58.333
because you didn't lay down
the law with Wally.

19:58.444 --> 19:59.843
Hank, please.

19:59.945 --> 20:02.709
You were right.
I don't know how to be a father.

20:02.815 --> 20:05.306
All the books about it are by comedians.

20:05.417 --> 20:08.682
And I never know when they're kidding
and when they're serious.

20:08.788 --> 20:11.552
- Please, I need you to go with me.
- No.

20:12.124 --> 20:13.352
You do everything right...

20:13.459 --> 20:16.257
but if you didn't, I'd be there for you.

20:19.231 --> 20:20.789
And could you drive?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.368
Wally still hasn't returned my car.

20:24.837 --> 20:27.738
The car was crammed with
cartons of cigarettes, packs of jerky...

20:27.840 --> 20:30.434
lighters. All your big-ticket impulse items.

20:30.543 --> 20:32.977
He says you okayed
the use of the credit card...

20:33.078 --> 20:35.911
and the use of the automobile.
Is that true?

20:36.982 --> 20:38.813
The jerky was for you.

20:39.985 --> 20:41.850
Hank, what should I do?

20:42.354 --> 20:45.255
Well, I'd lock him up for
what we know he did...

20:45.357 --> 20:48.724
and then toss on a few extra years
for what he probably did.

20:48.828 --> 20:51.456
Yeah, but if I lock him up,
he won't like me.

20:51.564 --> 20:54.590
But if I bail him out,
he'll just keep stealing my money...

20:54.700 --> 20:56.224
and I won't like him.

20:56.335 --> 20:57.700
Parenting is tough.

20:57.803 --> 21:01.295
Try having my job with a kid in jail.
That gets weird.

21:15.487 --> 21:17.148
Here we go.

21:17.256 --> 21:20.487
You know what would be cool?
If you left it a little longer in the back.

21:20.593 --> 21:21.992
It would be, like, our little bond.

21:22.094 --> 21:24.528
- I'd think you ought to...
- Sorry, no can do.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.598
You may not be happy with me now,
soldier...

21:26.699 --> 21:30.499
- but you'll thank me someday.
- For what? For making me a jarhead?

21:30.603 --> 21:34.937
For convincing the judge that the Army
is a better place for you than prison.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.407
Oh, and you're not a jarhead,
that's the Marine Corps.

21:38.510 --> 21:40.000
You're a grunt!

21:40.145 --> 21:43.876
Bobby, if you get caught drinking again,
it's gonna be your butt in this chair.

21:43.983 --> 21:46.008
- Ain't that right, Hank?
- Sure is.

21:46.118 --> 21:49.144
Now let's shave that thing
off of Wally's chin.

22:28.127 --> 22:28.294
DALE: Valet of the Dales is not responsible

22:28.294 --> 22:31.855
DALE: Valet of the Dales is not responsible
