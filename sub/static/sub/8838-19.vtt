WEBVTT

01:24.294 --> 01:25.712
HELLO, PETER.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.508
IS SCHOOL SESSION
OVER ALREADY?

01:30.675 --> 01:31.885
NO, SIR.

01:40.185 --> 01:42.520
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU,

01:42.687 --> 01:44.898
AND I HAVE
SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

01:45.064 --> 01:48.276
CAN'T IT HOLD?
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THINGS HERE.

01:48.443 --> 01:51.738
I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, SIR.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.072
I WAS
EXPELLED...

01:54.407 --> 01:56.951
FOR CHEATING
AND STEALING.

01:58.244 --> 01:59.954
IT'S ALL
IN THE LETTER.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.586
OHH...

02:06.753 --> 02:08.588
THEY WROTE YOU
ABOUT IT EARLIER,

02:08.755 --> 02:10.131
BUT YOU
DIDN'T ANSWER,

02:10.298 --> 02:11.549
SO THEY
SENT ME HOME.

02:13.009 --> 02:14.844
YOUR FATHER'S
BEEN AWAY, PETER.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.082
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.086
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.383
WE WILL
DISCUSS IT LATER.

03:14.988 --> 03:17.699
I'LL BE DONE IN A TIFF,
MASTER PETER.

03:17.866 --> 03:19.242
IF YOU'D LET US KNOW
YOU WERE COMING,

03:19.409 --> 03:21.828
WE'D HAVE HAD
EVERYTHING READY.

03:21.995 --> 03:24.581
WHY DON'T YOU POP IN
AND SAY HELLO
TO YOUR GRANDMAMA?

03:24.747 --> 03:26.165
SHE'LL BE HURT
IF YOU DIDN'T.

03:26.332 --> 03:28.293
Woman: INDEED I AM.

03:28.459 --> 03:29.627
THAT WILL DO, MAGGIE.

03:40.346 --> 03:41.514
WELL, PETER...

03:41.681 --> 03:44.475
AND WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT TO SAY
FOR YOURSELF?

03:44.642 --> 03:47.478
THE HEADMASTER'S
WIFE WROTE ME.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.063
IT WASN'T MUCH.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.524
ON SATURDAYS WE'D GO
FROM SHOP TO SHOP

03:51.691 --> 03:53.651
AND LIFT
WHATEVER WE COULD.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.069
AND WHOEVER CAME BACK
WITH THE MOST

03:55.236 --> 03:56.988
GOT TO BE CALLED
"ARTFUL DODGER"
FOR THE WEEK.

03:57.155 --> 04:00.617
ITEMS YOU VITALLY
NEEDED, NO DOUBT.

04:00.783 --> 04:02.368
AND THE CHEATING?

04:02.535 --> 04:04.704
DENIVER GOT HOLD
OF THE LATIN QUIZ,

04:04.871 --> 04:07.040
AND WE MEMORIZED
THE ANSWERS.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.708
IT WAS A LARK, REALLY.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.335
I KNEW THE ANSWERS
ALREADY.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.880
AND IT SHOOK THE SCHOOL
TO ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS.

04:14.047 --> 04:19.552
I DECLARE
OUR PUNDITS WERE BORN
UTTERLY WITHOUT HUMOR.

04:19.719 --> 04:21.387
AHH, MR. LUNDSTROM.

04:21.554 --> 04:24.974
PETER AND I
HAVE BEEN OVER HIS
SEVERAL PECCADILLOES,

04:25.141 --> 04:26.392
AND IN MY OPINION,

04:26.559 --> 04:29.354
HE'S HAD SUFFICIENT
PUNISHMENT ALREADY.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.730
I DON'T INTEND
TO PUNISH HIM.

04:30.897 --> 04:34.609
YOU DON'T?! HOW RARE
FOR US TO BE IN AGREEMENT.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.402
AH! WELL, THAT
SETTLES THE MATTER.

04:36.569 --> 04:39.739
I'LL WRITE
TO THE HEADMASTER,
BULLY HIM A LITTLE,

04:39.906 --> 04:42.367
AND WE'LL HAVE PETER
BACK IN THE SCHOOL
IN NO TIME.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.285
NOT AT THAT SCHOOL
WE WON'T.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.413
BUT IT'S
THE BEST AROUND!

04:47.580 --> 04:50.875
YOUR WIFE CHOSE IT
WITH YOUR CONSENT.

04:51.042 --> 04:53.086
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT.
I RELIED COMPLETELY ON HER,

04:53.252 --> 04:54.170
BUT NOW I'VE SEEN
SOME OF THE BOYS

04:54.337 --> 04:55.254
THAT CAME OUT
OF THAT SCHOOL,

04:55.421 --> 04:58.007
AND I SIMPLY
DON'T LIKE THEM.

04:58.174 --> 05:03.763
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
SOMETHING THAT HE
HAS NEVER YET HAD--

05:03.930 --> 05:06.933
SOMETHING THAT I HAD
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.727
WELL,
ACCORDING TO THE TALES
YOU TOLD MY DAUGHTER,

05:09.894 --> 05:11.437
THAT WASN'T VERY MUCH.

05:11.604 --> 05:12.814
Lundstrom:
IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME.

05:12.981 --> 05:14.607
I MADE MY WAY.

05:14.774 --> 05:18.528
I HELPED MY FATHER
AND HIS BROTHERS DIG THE SOD
FOR THE HOUSES THAT WE BUILT.

05:18.695 --> 05:21.030
I LEARNED TO CUT
A STRAIGHT FURROW.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.825
DO YOU PROPOSE
TO PUT A SHOVEL
IN PETER'S HANDS

05:23.992 --> 05:26.869
AND SET HIM
TO FARMING?

05:27.036 --> 05:28.955
I MAY. I MAY NOT.

05:29.122 --> 05:31.916
I'LL HAVE
TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
WITH MY COUSIN FIRST.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.252
MAY WE LEARN
WHAT SORT
OF ARRANGEMENTS?

05:34.419 --> 05:37.005
AND WHERE
IS THIS COUSIN?

05:37.171 --> 05:38.381
IN MINNESOTA.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.925
OH! AND YOU PROPOSE
TO SHIP THE BOY OUT

05:41.092 --> 05:43.428
TO THIS GODFORSAKEN
WILDERNESS?

05:43.594 --> 05:45.555
MY DAUGHTER,
GOD REST HER,

05:45.722 --> 05:47.807
WOULD NEVER
HAVE ALLOWED
SUCH A THING.

05:47.974 --> 05:49.600
SHE WOULD HAVE
ENCOURAGED IT.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.606
PETER...

05:55.773 --> 05:58.985
CONTRARY TO WHAT
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
MAY THINK,

05:59.152 --> 06:01.571
I'M NOT SENDING YOU
OUT TO EXILE.

06:01.738 --> 06:06.826
I'M SENDING YOU TO FIND
A SENSE OF VALUES.

06:09.746 --> 06:11.372
I'M GOING TO MAKE
THE ARRANGEMENTS.

06:43.321 --> 06:46.157
WELL, PETER, THIS
IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING
TO SPEND THE SUMMER.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.701
I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO
FIND CONDITIONS HERE

06:48.868 --> 06:51.788
SOMEWHAT
MORE PRIMITIVE THAN
BACK HOME, PETER,

06:51.954 --> 06:53.748
BUT YOUR AUNTIE
WILL--

06:53.915 --> 06:57.210
WE'RE COMFORTABLE, PETER,
AND YOU WILL BE, TOO.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.836
THANK HEAVEN
WE'RE HERE.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.505
I MUST USE
THE WATER CLOSET.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.632
Willie: THE WATER CLOSET!
WHAT'S THAT?

07:02.799 --> 07:05.051
UH, PETER, WE DON'T
CALL IT THAT HERE.

07:05.218 --> 07:08.179
IT'S, UM, IT'S
AROUND OUTSIDE IN BACK.

07:08.346 --> 07:10.139
WILLIE, SHOW HIM.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.474
COME ON.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.646
OH,
SO EMBARRASSING!

07:16.813 --> 07:18.773
OVER HERE.

07:18.940 --> 07:19.982
WHERE?

07:20.149 --> 07:21.275
HERE!

07:25.029 --> 07:26.739
OUTSIDE?

07:26.906 --> 07:28.825
SURE! WHY DO YOU
THINK THEY CALL IT
AN OUTHOUSE?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.076
WOULDN'T
WANT THIS THING

07:30.243 --> 07:32.120
SITTING IN
YOUR LIVING ROOM,
WOULD YOU?

07:35.748 --> 07:36.874
GO ON!

07:39.627 --> 07:40.878
DON'T FALL IN!

07:42.797 --> 07:45.591
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT AN OUTHOUSE WAS.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.093
OH, THAT'S
ENOUGH, WILLIE!

07:47.260 --> 07:48.594
WELL, PA TOLD ME
TO SHOW HIM.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.055
ALL RIGHT.
JUST TAKE THE BAG
UP THERE WITH YOUR SISTER.

07:51.222 --> 07:52.265
GO ALONG.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.235
HEY, NELS.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.236
HELLO, CHARLES.

08:05.403 --> 08:06.237
MADE GOOD TIME
FROM SLEEPY EYE.

08:06.404 --> 08:07.780
PRETTY GOOD, YEAH.

08:07.947 --> 08:10.491
WELL, I'M BEHOLDEN
TO YOU FOR KEEPING
AN EYE ON THE STORE.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.951
IT WAS
MY PLEASURE.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.912
THE MISSIS WOULD HAVE
EVERY ONE OF US GO
TO MEET HIM.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.582
HERE'S THE BOOKS.
TAKE A LOOK.
BEEN PRETTY QUIET.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.208
NO, THERE'S NO HURRY,
YOU KNOW.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.668
Harriet: WELL,
I WARNED YOU, PETER,

08:20.835 --> 08:23.296
YOU MIGHT FIND THINGS
RATHER PRIMITIVE HERE,

08:23.462 --> 08:26.883
BUT YOUR UNCLE IS GOING
TO INSTALL FACILITIES INSIDE

08:27.049 --> 08:28.593
AS SOON AS
HE HAS THE TIME.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.928
PETER, I'D
LIKE YOU TO MEET
A FRIEND OF OURS--

08:31.095 --> 08:31.888
MR. INGALLS.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.222
PETER,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:33.389 --> 08:34.473
THANK YOU, SIR.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.058
Harriet: WELL,
COME ALONG, PETER.

08:36.225 --> 08:37.977
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED
FROM YOUR TRAVELS.

08:38.144 --> 08:39.187
RIGHT UP THE STEPS.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.731
YOUR AUNTIE IS GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.240
HIS PA WROTE A LETTER.

08:51.407 --> 08:54.243
THE MISSIS
READ IT HER WAY.
I READ IT MINE.

08:54.410 --> 08:57.288
IT SEEMS THE BOY
HAS BEEN IN SOME
TROUBLE AT SCHOOL.

08:57.455 --> 08:58.789
HIS PA ASKED ME
TO GIVE HIM CHORES,

08:58.956 --> 09:01.667
MAKE HIM EARN HIS WAY,
TEACH HIM A SENSE
OF VALUES.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.086
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.047
I CAN'T EVEN
DO IT WITH MY OWN,

09:06.214 --> 09:08.090
NOT WITH HARRIET
TEACHING THEM OTHERWISE.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.800
WELL, JUST LOOK ON
IT AS A CHALLENGE.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.385
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.929
YOU NEED ANY HELP,
JUST CALL ME.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.680
YEAH. I'LL DO THAT.

09:14.847 --> 09:15.681
THANKS AGAIN, CHARLES.

09:15.848 --> 09:16.891
YOU BET.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.853
ALL YOU BROUGHT
WAS CLOTHES.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.730
YOU DIDN'T BRING
ANYTHING TO PLAY WITH.

09:22.897 --> 09:24.899
UH! WILLIE!

09:25.066 --> 09:26.817
MIND
YOUR MANNERS.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.362
MY GRANDMAMA PACKED
THESE PRESENTS.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.697
SHE SAID I SHOULD
BE SURE TO SAY

09:31.864 --> 09:34.700
THEY WERE A SMALL TOKEN
OF MY GRATITUDE

09:34.867 --> 09:36.410
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

09:38.079 --> 09:40.206
MY! WELL,
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

09:40.373 --> 09:41.165
HA HA HA!

09:41.332 --> 09:44.252
OH, MY GOODNESS!

09:44.418 --> 09:46.003
OH, THIS IS
SO EXCITING!

09:47.380 --> 09:48.839
OH!

09:49.006 --> 09:50.508
OH, MY.

09:50.675 --> 09:53.803
OH, IT'S SIMPLY
BEAUTIFUL.

09:53.970 --> 09:57.556
OH, MY. WELL, I MUST WRITE
TO YOUR GRANDMAMA

09:57.723 --> 09:58.808
AND THANK HER,

09:58.975 --> 10:00.309
AND YOU MUST WRITE,
TOO, CHILDREN.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.812
Nellie: OH, YES.
I'LL USE MY BEST
STATIONERY.

10:02.979 --> 10:03.938
Harriet:
YOU, TOO, WILLIE.

10:04.105 --> 10:06.440
COULDN'T I JUST
SEND THE TIE BACK?

10:06.607 --> 10:07.733
Harriet: WILLIE!

10:07.900 --> 10:09.485
Peter: AND THIS
IS FOR YOUR FATHER.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.071
Harriet: YOU TAKE IT DOWN TO HIM
RIGHT NOW, WILLIE.

10:12.238 --> 10:13.364
NOW!

10:13.531 --> 10:14.615
YES, MA'AM.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.451
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SHOW MY FRIENDS.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.079
ALL RIGHT, DARLING,
BUT DON'T GET IT DIRTY.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.081
OH, MY!

10:22.248 --> 10:23.207
OH!

10:23.374 --> 10:26.085
THIS IS
FROM THE ORIENT,
I'M SURE.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.587
IT'S PURE SILK.
I'M SURE IT IS.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.756
I'M SURE.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.592
WELL, LET'S GET YOU
ALL UNPACKED NOW

10:33.759 --> 10:36.762
SO YOU CAN
GO OUT AND PLAY.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.682
I'M--I'M RATHER TIRED.

10:39.849 --> 10:42.518
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE PLAYING TODAY.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.062
OH! WHAT IS THIS?

10:46.814 --> 10:51.027
WHY, THIS IS
SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!

10:51.193 --> 10:52.778
THAT'S FOR CHAPEL.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.447
WE ALL HAD
TO WEAR THEM.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.241
WELL, YOU SHALL
WEAR THIS TO CHURCH
TOMORROW

10:57.408 --> 11:01.037
AND SHOW
WALNUT GROVE WHAT
PROPER FOLK WEAR.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.455
OH, MY!

11:02.621 --> 11:04.123
[SIMPERS]

11:04.290 --> 11:05.833
YOU ARE GOING
TO SET YOUR MARK

11:06.000 --> 11:07.918
ON WALNUT GROVE,
PETER.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.734
HAVING TROUBLE
SLEEPING, PETER?

11:31.901 --> 11:33.027
YES, SIR.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.990
WELL, TAKES SOME
GETTING USED TO,
I KNOW.

11:40.326 --> 11:43.913
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
GIVE OR TAKE SOME,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.665
MY AUNT AND UNCLE
TOOK ME IN.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.877
MY MOTHER
HAD THE SICKNESS.

11:50.044 --> 11:52.004
I REMEMBER I FELT
VERY STRANGE
AT FIRST,

11:52.171 --> 11:56.175
BUT IN
NO TIME AT ALL,
I GOT USED TO IT,

11:56.342 --> 11:57.218
AND WHEN I WENT
BACK HOME,

11:57.385 --> 11:58.761
I ACTUALLY
MISSED THEM.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.517
WELL, WE'RE ALL
STRANGERS, BOY,

12:04.683 --> 12:07.353
UNTIL
WE BECOME FRIENDS.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.437
I KNOW
YOU'LL MISS YOUR PA

12:08.604 --> 12:09.772
JUST LIKE
HE'LL MISS YOU,

12:09.939 --> 12:12.525
BUT IT WILL PASS.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.610
HE WON'T MISS ME.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.947
WELL, NOW, WHAT KIND
OF A THING IS THAT
TO SAY?

12:18.114 --> 12:19.323
JUST THE TRUTH.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.201
GOOD NIGHT, SIR.

12:28.332 --> 12:29.834
GOOD NIGHT, PETER.

13:13.377 --> 13:16.255
GOOD MORNING,
YOUR LORDSHIP.

13:16.422 --> 13:18.674
YOU'RE A LOT
OF NINCOMPOOPS--

13:18.841 --> 13:20.968
EVERY ONE OF YOU!

13:21.135 --> 13:22.261
NINCOMPOOPS.

13:22.428 --> 13:23.471
DID YOU
HEAR THAT?

13:23.637 --> 13:26.307
WE'RE NINCOMPOOPS.

13:26.474 --> 13:27.391
Peter: HEY!

13:27.558 --> 13:29.435
Harriet:
OH! FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES!

13:29.602 --> 13:31.020
NOW STOP THAT!

13:31.187 --> 13:33.022
OH, YOU RUFFIANS!

13:33.189 --> 13:34.773
YOU BRATS!

13:34.940 --> 13:36.233
GO ON!
GET OUT OF HERE!

13:36.400 --> 13:37.943
YOU GO ON HOME!

13:38.110 --> 13:39.403
PETER, WAIT.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.821
NOW, LET HIM BE.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.073
YOU'VE CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE
AS IT IS.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.700
DON'T YOU TALK
TO ME LIKE THAT.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.076
WELL, THEN
BEHAVE YOURSELF,

13:46.243 --> 13:48.037
AND TRY TO USE
THE SENSE THAT

37:57.401 --> 37:58.945
THIS IS MY COUSIN
NELS OLESON.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.196
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

38:00.363 --> 38:01.572
Nels: I'M PLEASED
TO MEET YOU, MA'AM.

38:01.739 --> 38:04.158
AND THIS IS
HARRIET OLESON--
MY WIFE.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.534
WHERE'S PETER?

38:05.701 --> 38:08.037
Nels: UH, HE'S WITH
SOME FRIENDS.

38:08.204 --> 38:09.205
DID HE KNOW
WE'RE COMING?

38:09.372 --> 38:11.582
YES. HE WANTS TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING

38:11.749 --> 38:12.917
AND I PROMISED I'D
GET YOU OUT THERE

38:13.084 --> 38:14.168
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.087
I'M READY TO GO.
WE CAN USE
MY CARRIAGE.

38:16.253 --> 38:19.090
GOOD. I'LL GET
MY COAT.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.176
I'M DISAPPOINTED
PETER WASN'T HERE
TO MEET US.

38:24.053 --> 38:25.221
YOU SAID IN YOUR
TELEGRAM THAT YOU

38:25.388 --> 38:26.681
WANTED US TO DO
WHATEVER WE THOUGHT

38:26.847 --> 38:28.766
WAS BEST FOR PETER.

38:28.933 --> 38:30.643
[SIGH] WELL, I'M AFRAID
THAT HARRIET AND I

38:30.810 --> 38:33.312
WEREN'T ABLE TO GET
THROUGH TO HIM
VERY WELL,

38:33.479 --> 38:35.815
SO, HE'S BEEN STAYING
WITH THE INGALLS.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.274
THEY'VE DONE HIM
A WORLD OF GOOD.

38:37.441 --> 38:38.317
THE INGALLS?

38:38.484 --> 38:39.777
OH, WELL, HE'S JUST
A FARMER.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.988
IT ACTUALLY WAS
NELS' IDEA.
IT WASN'T MINE.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.449
WELL. SHALL WE GO?

38:50.871 --> 38:52.373
YOU STAY HERE
AND SING.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.419
OH!

39:20.818 --> 39:22.361
THEY'RE COMING,
UNCLE CHARLES!

39:22.528 --> 39:24.655
I KNOW THEY'RE COMING.
TAKE IT EASY.
DON'T GET SO EXCITED.

39:24.822 --> 39:27.324
I CAN'T HELP IT.
HE'S GOING TO BE
SO SURPRISED.

39:27.491 --> 39:28.284
I KNOW HE IS.

39:28.451 --> 39:31.037
PETER!
HOW ARE YOU?

39:31.203 --> 39:32.538
Peter: I'M FINE, SIR!

39:34.040 --> 39:35.708
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

39:50.598 --> 39:52.516
CHARLES, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET OLAF LUNDSTROM.

39:52.683 --> 39:53.893
A PLEASURE,
SIR.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.103
AND THIS IS PETER'S
GRANDMOTHER,
MRS. CALDWELL.

39:56.270 --> 39:57.563
MA'AM, VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU.

39:57.730 --> 39:59.648
I UNDERSTAND THE LAD'S
BEEN WORKING FOR YOU.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.776
YES. INDEED, HE HAS,
AND HE'S A HARD
WORKER, TOO.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.527
HA HA!
LOOK AT HIM!

40:03.694 --> 40:07.239
HE LOOKS
GOOD AND HEALTHY.

40:07.406 --> 40:08.908
PETER!

40:09.075 --> 40:10.993
COME ON OUT
SO WE CAN TALK.

40:25.049 --> 40:26.967
Peter: PAPA,
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

40:27.134 --> 40:29.720
Caldwell: PETER,
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
YOUR MANNERS?

40:29.887 --> 40:32.431
I'M SORRY,
GRANDMAMA. HELLO.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.225
ARE YOU SURPRISED,
PAPA?

40:34.391 --> 40:35.684
YES,
I WAS SURPRISED.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.728
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD BEEN WORKING
FOR MR. INGALLS.

40:37.895 --> 40:38.729
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

40:38.896 --> 40:40.231
NOW GATHER YOUR THINGS,

40:40.397 --> 40:43.567
AND YOU'LL TELL ME
ALL ABOUT THIS SUMMER
ON THE WAY.

40:43.734 --> 40:47.071
MY THINGS
ARE AT THE INGALLS.
I'LL GET THEM READY.

40:47.238 --> 40:48.948
WE'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

40:49.115 --> 40:50.366
IT'S NOT FAR.

40:50.533 --> 40:51.492
WE'LL DRIVE YOU TO--

40:51.659 --> 40:52.618
IT'S NOT FAR!

40:52.785 --> 40:53.828
PETER!

40:56.789 --> 40:59.959
NOW, WHAT IN HEAVEN'S
NAME DID I SAY?

41:00.126 --> 41:03.087
NOTHING.
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

41:03.254 --> 41:04.755
THE BOY WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THAT HE'D LEARNED TO SWIM.

41:04.922 --> 41:07.383
THAT'S WHY HE WANTED YOU
TO COME OUT HERE.

41:07.550 --> 41:10.928
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT HE COULDN'T SWIM.

41:11.095 --> 41:12.346
I'M SURE THERE'S
A LOT OF THINGS

41:12.513 --> 41:14.640
YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR SON,
MR. LUNDSTROM.

41:14.807 --> 41:16.100
Caldwell: MR. INGALLS!

41:16.267 --> 41:18.769
WE'RE WELL AWARE
OF PETER'S ACTIVITIES.

41:18.936 --> 41:20.729
ARE YOU WELL AWARE
THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE SCHOOL,

41:20.896 --> 41:23.941
THAT HE STEALS THINGS
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T NEED,
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHY?

41:24.108 --> 41:25.109
MR. INGALLS, I--

41:25.276 --> 41:26.360
Lundstrom: MOTHER!

41:28.654 --> 41:30.948
WHAT IS IT
YOU STARTED TO SAY?

41:31.115 --> 41:32.116
I THINK YOUR SON
STEALS THINGS

41:32.283 --> 41:35.411
SO YOU'LL
PAY ATTENTION TO HIM...

41:35.578 --> 41:38.122
SO THAT AT LEAST
YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

41:38.289 --> 41:39.707
Caldwell:
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

41:39.874 --> 41:41.041
IS IT?

41:43.669 --> 41:45.796
WHAT ELSE DO YOU TALK
TO YOUR SON ABOUT,
MR. LUNDSTROM?

41:49.800 --> 41:50.885
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO RAISING A BOY

41:51.051 --> 41:54.471
THAN JUST TEACHING HIM
A SENSE OF VALUES.

41:54.638 --> 41:56.015
THERE IS LOVE, SIR.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.065
WOULD YOU...

42:07.985 --> 42:10.154
WOULD YOU MIND
WALKING ME TO YOUR PLACE?

42:29.673 --> 42:31.175
I'LL BE READY
IN A MINUTE.

42:31.342 --> 42:33.761
OH, THERE'S
NO HURRY.
NO HURRY.

42:38.307 --> 42:39.391
PETER...

42:43.187 --> 42:44.313
I'M...

42:46.357 --> 42:47.399
HMM.

42:48.776 --> 42:52.363
I'M SORRY I PUT
A LOT OF THINGS
BETWEEN US.

42:52.529 --> 42:57.326
THE REASON WHY I
SENT YOU OUT HERE...

43:00.079 --> 43:01.247
IS...

43:03.707 --> 43:06.043
I WANTED YOU TO
LEARN WHAT I LEARNED

43:06.210 --> 43:07.711
IN A PLACE
LIKE THIS

43:07.878 --> 43:09.672
WHEN I WAS
A BOY YOUR AGE.

43:39.076 --> 43:45.749
NOW...HOW DID
MR. INGALLS
TEACH YOU TO SWIM?

43:45.916 --> 43:47.918
HE THREW ME IN.

43:48.085 --> 43:51.213
JUST LIKE MY PA
DID WITH ME.

43:51.380 --> 43:52.881
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT, DID YOU?

44:06.437 --> 44:08.272
PETER...

44:08.439 --> 44:10.149
LOOK AT ME, PLEASE.

44:10.316 --> 44:11.567
LOOK AT ME, PETER.

44:21.618 --> 44:24.663
I HAVEN'T BEEN
A GOOD FATHER
TO YOU.

44:24.830 --> 44:26.040
I KNOW THAT.

44:28.292 --> 44:29.835
I'M NOT GOING
TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES

44:30.002 --> 44:31.128
BECAUSE I JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY.

44:31.295 --> 44:36.925
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I WORK THE WAY I DO.

44:37.092 --> 44:38.177
I DON'T HAVE TO.

44:40.471 --> 44:42.848
JUST LIKE YOU
DON'T HAVE TO STEAL,
I SUPPOSE.

44:51.648 --> 44:52.816
I WANT TO CHANGE.

44:55.152 --> 44:57.363
I WANT TO BE
A GOOD FATHER
TO YOU.

44:59.698 --> 45:01.367
YOU'RE CRYING, PAPA.

45:04.036 --> 45:05.412
PAPA, DON'T.

45:09.166 --> 45:10.459
I LOVE YOU.

45:13.003 --> 45:15.089
[SOBBING]

45:35.484 --> 45:37.361
HA HA HA!

45:38.320 --> 45:40.656
PETER,
I LOVE YOU.

45:40.823 --> 45:41.740
I LOVE YOU!

45:41.907 --> 45:44.576
HA HA HA!

45:48.580 --> 45:50.332
[SOFTLY]
OH, I LOVE YOU.

45:53.877 --> 45:55.921
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME MORE TEA, MRS. CALDWELL?

45:56.088 --> 45:57.881
NO, THANK YOU.

45:58.048 --> 45:59.216
LOOK
AT THE TIME!

45:59.383 --> 46:01.051
I HAVE TO GO
AND TELL THEM
TO HURRY.

46:01.218 --> 46:03.595
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
MRS. CALDWELL.
I'LL DO IT.

46:05.722 --> 46:07.558
[PETER GIGGLING]

46:07.724 --> 46:08.559
HERE THEY ARE.

46:08.725 --> 46:10.978
Caldwell: OH!
OH, THERE YOU ARE!

46:11.145 --> 46:13.063
WHERE ARE
PETER'S THINGS?

46:13.230 --> 46:14.731
IN THE LOFT.

46:14.898 --> 46:15.983
IN THE LOFT?

46:16.150 --> 46:18.569
WE'LL BARELY
MAKE THE TRAIN
AS IT IS.

46:18.735 --> 46:19.903
NO, WE WON'T.

46:20.070 --> 46:20.946
WHAT?

46:21.113 --> 46:22.531
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO MAKE THE TRAIN.

46:22.698 --> 46:24.158
WE'RE GOING SWIMMING.

46:24.324 --> 46:26.410
MR. INGALLS, WE'RE GOING
TO STAY ON A WHILE.

46:26.577 --> 46:28.912
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL SHARE THE LOFT WITH PETER.

46:29.079 --> 46:32.749
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I SLEPT ON A GOOD HAY BED.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.877
MR. LUNDSTROM,
I'D BE DELIGHTED.

46:35.043 --> 46:35.919
THANK YOU. LET'S GO.

46:36.086 --> 46:37.588
Caldwell:
MR. LUNDSTROM...

46:37.754 --> 46:42.259
MAY I REMIND YOU
YOU HAVE A STOCKHOLDERS'
MEETING ON THURSDAY.

46:42.426 --> 46:45.262
OH, MY, MY, MY, MY, MY!

46:45.429 --> 46:47.347
MY SON AND I
CAN'T MAKE IT.

46:47.514 --> 46:48.640
HA HA!

46:52.102 --> 46:53.228
HA HA HA!

46:53.395 --> 46:54.521
HAVE A GOOD TIME!

46:58.609 --> 47:00.777
HA HA HA!
