00:36.450 --> 00:37.955
That's far enough.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.363
Drop your laundry
and turn slowly.

00:45.826 --> 00:47.734
So, you gonna
rob me now ?

00:47.910 --> 00:49.653
I need to remind you
who I am ?

00:49.880 --> 00:51.890
Omar, isn't it ?

00:56.622 --> 00:57.797
Pull it slowly.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.023
Then toss it.

00:59.237 --> 01:01.233
Oh, I will move slow.

01:01.587 --> 01:03.317
But I ain't tossin' nothin'

01:03.911 --> 01:05.263
bow tie.

01:05.553 --> 01:06.581
So whatever you gonna do

01:06.590 --> 01:08.665
you might as well go ahead
and make it quick.

01:09.976 --> 01:11.341
I knew you'd come back.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.161
I trust you didn't
lose sleep over it.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.170
Worryin' about you would
be like wonderin'

01:15.180 --> 01:16.486
if the sun's gonna come up.

01:17.632 --> 01:19.731
I ain't about to wild out over it.

01:20.501 --> 01:22.370
What I want to know is
how you find me ?

01:22.432 --> 01:25.214
Your boy, he didn't
give you up easy.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.626
Ain't sugar-water runnin'
through them veins.

01:28.054 --> 01:30.494
- You kill him ?
- He's resting.

01:31.453 --> 01:33.399
I see you favor a 45.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.054
Tonight I do.

01:35.784 --> 01:38.781
And I keeps one in the chamber,
in case you ponderin'.

01:41.354 --> 01:43.022
Nice show piece
you got there.

01:43.122 --> 01:46.851
Walther PPK.
380, double action.

01:47.418 --> 01:49.175
Hear them walthers
like to jump some.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.663
As will you,
with one in your elbow.

01:51.801 --> 01:54.707
That gun ain't got enough firepower
to make my joint useless.

01:54.808 --> 01:57.221
It definitely won't stop me
from emptyin' out half my mag.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.141
- You might not hit me.
- This range ?

02:00.217 --> 02:02.034
And this caliber ?

02:02.869 --> 02:04.549
Even if I miss,
I can't miss.

02:04.623 --> 02:06.634
I admire a man
with confidence.

02:06.747 --> 02:09.299
I don't see no sweat
your brow neither, bro.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.352
I suppose we could
stand here all night.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.740
S'pose we could.

02:20.145 --> 02:22.582
Or settle this
once and forever.

02:28.066 --> 02:30.958
I want to ask you something... brother.

02:36.769 --> 02:38.249
Omar listenin'.

04:11.592 --> 04:12.483
Middle Ground

04:33.162 --> 04:34.283
<i<I'm going up the west.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.638
<i>A-ight, me, too.
A-ight.</i>

04:38.200 --> 04:39.891
Here we go.

04:46.009 --> 04:48.188
<i>Yo, I need some
face time with the man.</i>

04:48.283 --> 04:50.479
<i>Hold up, I'll holler
back at you, man.</i>

04:50.605 --> 04:51.663
That would be Shamrock.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.612
Assuming Stringer Bell is the man,
now we wait for the return call.

04:56.892 --> 04:58.456
This is beautiful.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.950
Lester, can you actually
believe we fucking sold

05:00.951 --> 05:02.511
the wiretaps to the targets.

05:03.305 --> 05:05.974
For a week at least.

05:07.094 --> 05:09.039
Maybe we duck the bullet.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.172
Maybe we clean this mess quietly,

05:11.361 --> 05:13.981
throw some horseshit at
whatever reporter shows up

05:14.424 --> 05:16.683
and the Mayor
forges and forgets.

05:16.936 --> 05:18.498
We're ready to move on this, right ?

05:18.593 --> 05:21.159
As soon as we get the word,
we shut down all three zones

05:21.160 --> 05:22.733
toss everyone into wagons.

05:22.860 --> 05:25.070
There'll be nothing left
of it before midnight shift.

05:25.259 --> 05:28.228
So what the fuck are we
waiting on for a day and half ?

05:28.323 --> 05:30.300
Why isn't the Hall calling us ?

05:38.902 --> 05:41.652
Commissioner Burrell
for Mayor Royce.

05:41.927 --> 05:43.880
- I've heard enough...
- Hold on, Coleman.

05:43.898 --> 05:45.349
Come on, let the man talk, huh ?

05:45.490 --> 05:48.002
Excuse me, Mayor. I have
Commissioner Burrell on the line.

05:48.096 --> 05:50.244
- He says it's urgent.
- I'll bet it is.

05:50.355 --> 05:52.188
He wants to move, Clarence.

05:52.282 --> 05:54.967
He wants to clean this shit up
yesterday, and so do we.

05:55.045 --> 05:56.147
Tell him to hold.

05:56.831 --> 05:58.632
- Go ahead, gene.
- Look

05:58.711 --> 06:00.673
I'm not a politician,
I'm an academic.

06:01.538 --> 06:03.970
All I know is that from a
public health perspective

06:04.018 --> 06:06.498
there are remarkable things
happening in the free zones.

06:06.518 --> 06:10.478
Needle exchanges, on-site blood
testing, condom distribution.

06:10.557 --> 06:13.137
Most of all we're interacting
with an at-risk community

06:13.164 --> 06:14.552
that is largely elusive.

06:14.597 --> 06:17.133
We're even talking some of these
people into drug treatment.

06:17.142 --> 06:20.347
And that's just what U.M. and
Bon Secours have brought to the table.

06:20.503 --> 06:21.974
If this thing were sanctioned

06:21.975 --> 06:24.474
my department could put
public resources into play.

06:24.511 --> 06:27.045
You people can't
see the forest here.

06:27.769 --> 06:28.922
Odell ?

06:29.380 --> 06:33.614
When the story breaks, the ministers
will surely be against you.

06:33.787 --> 06:36.478
And most of the City Council
will be walking sideways

06:36.479 --> 06:38.290
away from your administration.

06:38.369 --> 06:41.022
And my guess is the Governor
and the legislature

06:41.148 --> 06:44.877
will use this opportunity to piss on
the city from a great height.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.181
And Washington ?
Oh...

06:47.355 --> 06:49.072
Can you imagine how far

06:49.073 --> 06:51.240
the United States
Department of Justice

06:51.241 --> 06:53.280
is gonna crawl up
your ass behind this ?

06:53.298 --> 06:55.645
Crime is down, Odell.

06:57.355 --> 06:59.851
Medical people are
telling me this could work.

06:59.946 --> 07:03.690
I mean, a 14% decline
in felonies citywide

07:03.879 --> 07:06.880
I might be untouchable on this.
Now, look, we need to think

07:07.037 --> 07:08.922
see if we can keep
this thing going without

07:08.932 --> 07:10.416
calling it what it really is, huh ?

07:10.436 --> 07:12.597
- Jesus.
- Now, there's got to be a way.

07:12.677 --> 07:15.439
I want you to talk this thing out.
Hey, Erv, thanks for holding...

07:15.930 --> 07:17.210
Yes, but...

07:21.047 --> 07:23.322
Yes, I understand.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.450
Then I'll wait
to hear from you.

07:27.745 --> 07:30.651
We're to hold off
on any action in Amsterdam.

07:30.888 --> 07:34.757
No arrests, no movement
until further notice.

07:34.899 --> 07:37.380
He says he wants to regroup.

07:37.553 --> 07:40.650
Determine the most
effective course of action.

07:40.839 --> 07:44.662
Translate that for me, will ya, Erv ?
I don't speak his fucked-up lingo.

07:44.772 --> 07:48.278
Royce is figuring a way to put
all of us in the guillotine

07:48.736 --> 07:51.896
and keep the blood from
spraying anywhere near the Hall.

07:51.974 --> 07:55.101
Shit, I'll be goddamned if
I'm gonna go out like that:

07:55.243 --> 07:57.124
Bent over in public.

07:57.219 --> 07:59.951
I can spin the story just as
well as that motherfucker.

08:00.030 --> 08:02.888
- You're gonna go to the press ?
- Not me.

08:03.062 --> 08:04.637
But I know a slick little bastard

08:04.665 --> 08:07.031
who will happily
put Hizzoner's shit in the street.

08:10.644 --> 08:12.761
Somethin' funny 'bout that ?

08:12.966 --> 08:16.033
'Cause I look in the paper and I see
all these federal grants comin' down

08:16.062 --> 08:17.170
but nothin' for B-and-B.

08:18.495 --> 08:21.512
- You're expecting what ?
- Payout.

08:21.608 --> 08:23.525
A big payout for what
we put in, man.

08:23.526 --> 08:25.841
Federal dollars on them
Howard Street rehabs.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.606
- You gave money up front ?
- 250,000, yep.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.216
To Clay Davis.

08:31.684 --> 08:33.186
How you know ?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.191
What you sayin' ?

08:35.412 --> 08:37.782
He's runnin' game ?
Naw, hell no, he ain't that brazen.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.073
Lemme guess.

08:40.214 --> 08:42.298
He told you about the faucet.

08:42.551 --> 08:44.636
Or was it the goose
that laid the golden egg ?

08:45.348 --> 08:47.055
You ever actually
meet the man ?

08:47.181 --> 08:50.091
Did you ever actually see any of
your cash reach anyone in authority ?

08:50.100 --> 08:51.969
Yeah, I met the guy
at the federal building.

08:51.973 --> 08:52.659
Yeah, I met him.

08:52.687 --> 08:53.608
Yeah, what office ?

08:55.582 --> 08:56.907
He came down to the lobby.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.688
he rainmade you.

09:04.397 --> 09:06.824
A guy says if you pay him,
he can make it rain.

09:07.082 --> 09:10.098
You pay him. If and when it rains,
he takes the credit.

09:10.210 --> 09:13.306
If and when it doesn't, he finds
reasons for you to pay him more.

09:13.479 --> 09:14.776
Clay Davis rainmade you.

09:14.806 --> 09:18.139
Naw, man, he got them building
permits in no time at all, man.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.044
I mean, we bribing
these motherfuckers.

09:20.146 --> 09:21.978
He got the city
contractor's money back.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.109
- How much ?
- 35,000 so far.

09:24.552 --> 09:27.696
- On a quarter million you gave him ?
- It's for bribing the motherfuckers.

09:27.705 --> 09:28.864
There are no bribes !

09:29.622 --> 09:31.960
You really think
a state senator is going

09:31.977 --> 09:34.093
to risk his salary
and his position

09:34.250 --> 09:37.553
by walking into a federal office with
a briefcase full of drug money ?

09:37.583 --> 09:39.462
I seen Chunky... Chunky Coates.

09:39.494 --> 09:41.948
Chunky Coates gets his grant money
same way everyone does.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.512
He fills out applications,
he makes sure the plans meet spec

09:44.540 --> 09:45.698
then he prays like hell.

09:47.218 --> 09:50.187
This is an old game in this
town, and Clay Davis ?

09:51.273 --> 09:53.847
That goniff was born with
his hand in someone's pocket.

09:54.242 --> 09:56.438
I just wish you'd have
run it by me sooner.

10:09.757 --> 10:13.437
Now here's Shamrock
returning Bodie's call.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.505
<i>Talk about it.</i>

10:14.506 --> 10:16.938
<i>Yo, the man said he'd see you,
same time as always.</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:18.030
<i>You know the spot.</i>

10:18.058 --> 10:21.346
During the first call, Sydnor had eyes
on Shamrock over in West Baltimore.

10:21.365 --> 10:23.238
Alright ? Now look at this.

10:23.876 --> 10:27.400
At the time, Stringer Bell
was at the print shop.

10:27.479 --> 10:29.184
So it couldn't be
a face-to-face meet.

10:29.278 --> 10:31.648
We didn't catch a call between
Stringer and Shamrock.

10:32.311 --> 10:33.370
How can that be ?

10:33.449 --> 10:36.861
Stringer's phone isn't on the same
network as everyone below him.

10:36.956 --> 10:40.257
- Right you are, ma'am.
- Bell's not using Bernard's burners ?

10:40.399 --> 10:43.543
And Shamrock has a separate
phone for calling Bell.

10:43.969 --> 10:47.490
We can't hear those calls because
the system's compartmentalized.

10:48.328 --> 10:49.845
Some tricky motherfuckers.

10:49.939 --> 10:52.608
A week or so up on Bernard's phones
and we'll have everybody

10:52.655 --> 10:55.847
up to and including Shamrock
tangled up in conspiracy counts.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.521
But Bell or Barksdale ?

10:57.583 --> 11:00.294
Not unless we can pluck their
cell numbers out the air.

11:03.365 --> 11:06.034
Where you headed ?
Toy store.

11:09.432 --> 11:11.973
He legalized drugs
in special zones ?

11:13.048 --> 11:14.431
It's more
than that.

11:14.785 --> 11:17.844
Major Colvin lost
the necessary perspective

11:17.845 --> 11:19.966
that is required for command.

11:20.836 --> 11:24.343
We were all under pressure
to reduce crime before year end

11:24.437 --> 11:27.106
and he responded poorly
to that pressure.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.775
Pressured by who ?
Mayor ?

11:30.028 --> 11:32.571
I'm just explaining to you

11:32.775 --> 11:35.999
that the pressure was applied
all down the line

11:36.171 --> 11:38.686
from headquarters
to the district commanders

11:38.688 --> 11:41.338
to the shift
and sector supervisors.

11:41.511 --> 11:44.829
So Colvin's 14% decline was bullshit.

11:46.155 --> 11:48.920
And they're selling drugs
with police permission in Western ?

11:49.473 --> 11:54.004
The department is ready to shut that
mess down with mass arrests.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.244
- I'm on top of it.
- Why don't you move ?

11:58.159 --> 11:59.763
The Mayor says wait.

12:00.828 --> 12:01.610
Why ?

12:03.277 --> 12:05.472
I think he's gonna
make some kinda show.

12:05.519 --> 12:07.021
Spin it so that
I take the weight

12:07.022 --> 12:08.994
for something that has
nothing to do with me

12:09.088 --> 12:11.277
and everything to do
with the pressure

12:11.278 --> 12:13.544
that my commanders
are getting from City Hall.

12:19.025 --> 12:22.673
Going public and putting the
responsibility for this

12:22.720 --> 12:25.848
back at City Hall is the only
move I have left, right ?

12:26.874 --> 12:30.049
I mean, I spin Royce
before he spins me.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.419
- And you want me to...
- Not you.

12:32.514 --> 12:34.345
Your pal, Tony Gray.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.168
If he's gonna take a run at Royce,
he's gonna need ammunition, right ?

12:42.228 --> 12:45.782
I don't have a relationship with Gray.
I do have one with you.

12:46.367 --> 12:50.047
And Councilman ?
You owe me.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.913
- What's up, hotshot ?
- I got a technical question.

12:57.991 --> 12:59.503
Remember those
analog units we used

12:59.532 --> 13:01.419
to use to pull cell
numbers out of the air ?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.030
The C.F. something-something...

13:03.187 --> 13:05.477
Yeah, Cell Frequency
Identification Device.

13:05.636 --> 13:08.352
- The triggerfish, yeah.
- That one, it could flag a number.

13:08.432 --> 13:10.001
Right, but the old analog machines ?

13:10.011 --> 13:11.692
We used to have to
follow the guy around

13:11.710 --> 13:14.433
stay close while he used the phone.
New digitals...

13:14.543 --> 13:16.883
bing, we just pull the number
right off the cell towers.

13:16.911 --> 13:19.476
So, you got any down out at
Woodlawn that daddy can borrow ?

13:19.503 --> 13:21.067
- What about yours ?
- What ?

13:21.225 --> 13:23.137
City has three of 'em,
I remember right.

13:23.278 --> 13:25.109
Homeland security
grant sent 'em to you

13:25.110 --> 13:26.848
every big county department
in the state.

13:26.943 --> 13:28.554
No fucking way.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.898
Thanks.

13:37.227 --> 13:39.659
- I doubted you, Tommy.
- I told you it was big.

13:39.691 --> 13:40.795
If we play it right.

13:40.890 --> 13:43.544
He wants me to turn the
information over to Tony Gray...

13:43.639 --> 13:46.444
and let him use it, he figures if
Tony's running against the Mayor

13:46.482 --> 13:48.443
he'll take aim at Royce
and not the department.

13:48.473 --> 13:50.067
We may want to bring
Tony in on it

13:50.100 --> 13:51.710
keep him viable
against the Mayor.

13:51.868 --> 13:54.367
But right now, you need to find
out what this is all about.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.654
Firsthand... do you know
this, Major Colvin ?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.244
To shake hands, maybe.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.503
If Burrell's painting
him the villain

14:01.677 --> 14:04.473
Colvin might be anxious to tell
someone his side of the story.

14:14.329 --> 14:16.619
McNulty, Major Crimes.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.558
Sullivan, minor irritations.

14:20.631 --> 14:23.522
You got anything back there that's like
the old C.F.I.D. but digital ?

14:23.712 --> 14:26.018
- For catching cell numbers ?
- Catching who ?

14:26.143 --> 14:27.992
You know, a triggerfish machine.

14:29.491 --> 14:32.873
Triggerfish. For cell numbers.

14:35.509 --> 14:37.753
How 'bout I look around
there on my own ?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.105
Yes, this is Councilman
Carcetti over at the Hall.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.495
I'm trying to reach Major Colvin.

14:55.513 --> 14:57.059
<i>I'm sorry, but
he's on vacation.</i>

14:57.134 --> 15:00.090
I'm aware of that, but I'm trying to
reach him on municipal business...

15:00.118 --> 15:02.129
<i>Well, I could put you
through to his voice mail.</i>

15:02.148 --> 15:04.908
No, not his voice mail. I said I have
to reach him immediately...

15:04.920 --> 15:06.128
<i>- Immediately ?
- Right...</i>

15:06.147 --> 15:08.622
<i>- How about his cell phone ?
- His cell, it'll be fine...</i>

15:08.717 --> 15:11.006
<i>Alright. Four-oh...</i>

15:17.538 --> 15:19.845
Alright, that's enough.

15:21.534 --> 15:23.478
Yeah, I know, it hurts.

15:23.587 --> 15:26.573
But your fists gonna
be like rocks after awhile.

15:30.505 --> 15:32.797
Justin, c'mere.

15:34.708 --> 15:37.092
- Alright.
- I want you to push me on my chest.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.114
You ain't got to do it hard.

15:42.433 --> 15:43.931
That's how you was standin'.

15:43.979 --> 15:45.805
You ain't have no weight
on your back foot.

15:45.824 --> 15:46.394
That's right.

15:46.427 --> 15:50.312
No center of gravity.
Plus, if you get your stance right...

15:50.406 --> 15:52.793
then you got the means
to put your hip into the punch.

15:52.871 --> 15:55.257
Bub-bub, right ?
Bub-bub.

15:55.352 --> 15:56.977
That's where your power come from.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.333
Yeah, but what happened
when we get hit ?

15:59.412 --> 16:01.717
- Say what ?
- We get hit

16:01.797 --> 16:05.303
even with this pad,
you gonna get trucked.

16:05.650 --> 16:07.561
All this stuff fallin' apart.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.393
Yeah, the heavy bag, too.

16:09.488 --> 16:10.989
Yeah, where you get this stuff at ?

16:11.161 --> 16:12.632
The Town of Bedrock ?

16:14.511 --> 16:17.054
Naw, he said nobody. So you
gonna have to wait right here.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.660
What you mean wait right here ?
You know who I am, boy ?

16:21.431 --> 16:23.278
Man say he want
to see Avon...

16:23.279 --> 16:25.016
Makin' me wait
to see my own partner ?

16:25.079 --> 16:27.006
- He new, String.
- Fuck that.

16:27.132 --> 16:30.466
Lotta new faces round here, man...
Way too many, you ask me.

16:31.445 --> 16:33.181
Get the fuck out of here.

16:37.335 --> 16:40.622
- Where Avon at ?
- He'll be along shortly.

16:41.016 --> 16:43.512
That's good 'cause
I came to see you, anyway.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.328
What you need ?

16:53.779 --> 16:55.611
I need you to hit somebody.

16:55.832 --> 16:57.365
Who we hittin' ?

16:58.106 --> 17:01.014
- Clay Davis.
- The Clay Davis ?

17:01.249 --> 17:02.718
Downtown Clay Davis ?

17:02.746 --> 17:04.763
That suppose to mean
somethin' to me, man ?

17:05.087 --> 17:08.121
- That nigger need to be got.
- Shit, String, murder ain't no thing.

17:08.468 --> 17:10.522
But this here is some
assassination shit...

17:10.569 --> 17:12.924
Look, I tell you you gettin'
somebody, you getting him.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.998
- I ain't askin'.
- Damn, String, I don't know...

17:15.017 --> 17:17.505
Nigger, I got to remind you
who the fuck you work for ?!

17:17.551 --> 17:21.531
Hey, yo. I think Slim gonna have
to sit this one out, boss.

17:22.874 --> 17:25.859
So you gonna hit a
state senator now, huh ?

17:26.869 --> 17:30.213
Yo, you kill a downtown nigger
like that the whole world

17:30.214 --> 17:31.831
gonna stand up and take notice.

17:33.031 --> 17:38.543
I'm talking about the state police,
federals, all of that.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.727
You need a day-of-the-jackal
type motherfucker

17:41.728 --> 17:43.288
basically to do
some shit like that.

17:43.307 --> 17:44.978
Not a rough and tumble
nigga like Slim.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.736
- That nigger took our money, man.
- I seen it comin'.

17:47.846 --> 17:50.422
Well. He got to go.

17:50.516 --> 17:53.438
Naw, you a fucking businessman.
You'd wanna handle it like that.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.352
You don't wanna get all gangster
wild with it an' shit, right ?

17:58.256 --> 18:00.973
What I tell you bout playin'
them fucking away games ?

18:05.271 --> 18:06.094
Yeah.

18:07.133 --> 18:11.035
They saw your ghetto ass
comin' from miles away, nigger.

18:11.510 --> 18:15.521
You got a fucking beef with them ?
That shit is on you.

18:20.607 --> 18:24.587
So... we aim this
at the nearest celltower

18:25.234 --> 18:27.429
the one that would
be the conduit for calls

18:27.430 --> 18:29.619
coming to and from our boy, Bell.

18:31.537 --> 18:32.737
And...

18:33.448 --> 18:35.596
we let rip.

18:37.334 --> 18:39.166
Fucking hell.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.120
Look's like Baltimore white pages,
without any names.

18:42.309 --> 18:44.600
But the pattern trace
will pull that down.

18:45.061 --> 18:47.409
You know, if we know the approximate
time of Bell's call

18:47.437 --> 18:50.123
we can start just by pulling calls
off that tower, at that time.

18:50.142 --> 18:51.298
That could be thousands.

18:51.851 --> 18:54.251
Yeah, that's the baseline,
but we get a second hit

18:54.345 --> 18:57.396
- and that list comes down to dozens.
- And after a third or fourth...

18:57.423 --> 18:58.722
then we've got his number.

18:58.959 --> 19:03.000
I can't believe that this was just
sitting over at I.S.D. gathering dust.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.263
We're going to be on these
motherfuckers for real now, Lester.

19:06.282 --> 19:08.576
They don't know about
this technology yet.

19:08.670 --> 19:10.646
For once they can't
change and adjust.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.020
It's genius.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.393
Oh, happy day

19:25.209 --> 19:27.168
when jesus washed

19:29.710 --> 19:32.554
oh when he washed

19:33.787 --> 19:36.691
he washed my sins away.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.725
You need something ?

19:40.136 --> 19:41.652
How much you make ?

19:41.809 --> 19:43.231
What ?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.695
On them tees ?
How much you make ?

19:47.623 --> 19:50.307
A fair profit.
No more than that.

19:52.314 --> 19:54.231
You should probably sell
sweats with hoodys.

19:54.249 --> 19:55.873
Since the seasons changin' an' all.

19:58.727 --> 20:00.985
Where you live at ?

20:06.971 --> 20:09.067
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops.</i>

20:09.095 --> 20:10.056
Bodie Broadus.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.135
The man with the hands.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.042
I heard was, um, openin' up
a gym or somethin'.

20:15.137 --> 20:18.644
Yeah, tryin' to.
I'm lookin' to get up with Avon.

20:19.244 --> 20:22.008
- Thought you was out.
- Man, that's why I'm came to you.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.023
I mean, I feel like
the way we left it

20:24.070 --> 20:25.956
I can't just roll up
on the man, you know ?

20:33.586 --> 20:36.950
hey, yo, it's me.
Yo, I got that hitter here with me.

20:37.329 --> 20:39.288
Yeah, the soldier
that walked in and out.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.452
Yeah, he want to see the top man.

20:44.074 --> 20:46.838
You slam shit like that
you gonna fall out one day.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.234
I'm good.

20:51.308 --> 20:53.441
I'm tryin' to school you, boy

20:53.488 --> 20:55.698
and you just don't wanna know.

21:00.107 --> 21:02.632
I'm cool, Huck.
I'm good.

21:13.202 --> 21:16.092
<i>Whitey sale,
whitey sale.</i>

21:16.251 --> 21:18.415
One for three,
three for five.

21:27.304 --> 21:30.232
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale.</i>

21:33.330 --> 21:35.287
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale !</i>

21:42.605 --> 21:44.933
<i>Alright, so what you
want me to tell the man ?</i>

21:45.103 --> 21:47.533
<i>Yo, I'll give word up
and then I'll hit you back.</i>

21:47.576 --> 21:49.647
Shamrock.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.946
4:40 P.M.

22:09.976 --> 22:11.803
B-and-B enterprises...

22:11.890 --> 22:16.033
<i>- We need to have lunch.
- Alright, hold on, I'll call you back.</i>

22:44.161 --> 22:46.446
<i>- Yo.
- It's me.</i>

22:46.532 --> 22:47.989
It's good.

22:51.961 --> 22:53.389
Yeah, it's me.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.189
<i>Yo, tell the hitter, tell him
the tall man pick him up.</i>

22:56.646 --> 22:58.347
<i>- Right.
- 4:47.</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:00.532
A seven minute window.

23:03.346 --> 23:06.946
There's 892 phone numbers.
That's our baseline.

23:07.060 --> 23:09.446
- We're on our way.
- Yep.

23:24.089 --> 23:26.132
Stay the fuck there, man.

23:34.445 --> 23:35.132
Yo.

23:45.345 --> 23:48.446
Jimmy ! On the clean phone.

23:48.903 --> 23:51.233
He just hit your friend's number.

23:51.261 --> 23:53.975
The one off the business
card you gave me.

23:55.246 --> 23:58.132
- The Western ?
- His cell.

24:01.345 --> 24:03.961
Should we be worried
about this ?

24:05.390 --> 24:06.066
Naw.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.660
- A boxing gym, huh ?
- It ain't a proper one yet.

24:10.732 --> 24:12.603
Why I asked to see you.

24:13.702 --> 24:16.179
So, what you know about takin'care
of something like that ?

24:16.232 --> 24:19.745
Not a damn thing.
But I know that sweet science.

24:19.845 --> 24:21.517
And I got some kids
who are interested.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.774
What I got a need for,
bro, is equipment.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.661
Man, these kids
gonna get rained on.

24:27.732 --> 24:31.041
They need headgear,
they need guards, cups

24:31.482 --> 24:33.069
you know, so they
can take the hit.

24:33.102 --> 24:34.918
Shoot, you know what
I'm sayin', man.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.489
I seen your picture on them
globe posters back in the day.

24:37.589 --> 24:39.403
Undercard shit, maybe, you know.

24:39.516 --> 24:41.732
Yeah, but still,
you was golden gloves.

24:41.845 --> 24:45.189
For a minute.
But I had a physical defect.

24:45.403 --> 24:47.174
What, you had a glass jaw ?

24:47.245 --> 24:51.345
- Nah, forehead, nigger.
- Cranium shot'll do you wrong.

24:51.403 --> 24:53.573
Yeah, look here, man.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.661
You seen new heavy bags ?
Look, freestandin', man.

24:57.731 --> 24:59.544
All you gotta do is add water.

24:59.545 --> 25:03.575
Then you got speed bags,
right there, right ?

25:03.660 --> 25:06.002
You got this headgear
right here. It's new.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.817
Look, protect the cheek
and the chin.

25:08.874 --> 25:09.605
You know.

25:10.175 --> 25:14.260
And I know I can go around and
collect a dollar here, dollar there.

25:14.302 --> 25:17.102
But I'm trying to put together
a select group of people, right ?

25:17.161 --> 25:20.317
I call them my,
my gold circle club

25:20.488 --> 25:23.074
and they gonna make
a substantial contribution

25:23.075 --> 25:25.474
and just get
this thing rollin' right.

25:25.745 --> 25:30.073
I mean, I'm gonna put their name and
picture up on the wall in the gym.

25:30.674 --> 25:33.017
What you tryin' to get
me to join a club ?

25:33.117 --> 25:34.617
Naw, man, I'm just sayin'.

25:34.688 --> 25:36.742
There's all sorts of levels.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.945
We got the, the silver club,
we got the bronze club.

25:39.988 --> 25:43.960
Man, for motherfuckers who really
don't want to dig that deep.

25:44.074 --> 25:45.402
Come on, man, check it out.

25:45.817 --> 25:48.260
Nah, man, I ain't got no time
for this bullshit, man.

25:48.644 --> 25:50.745
You know I don't want
my fucking name and face

25:50.765 --> 25:52.660
on no damn wall.
You crazy, nigger ?

25:53.217 --> 25:55.316
How much money you talkin' about ?

25:59.274 --> 26:00.917
$10,000.

26:07.018 --> 26:09.802
I see you go through
all that for 10,000 ?

26:10.244 --> 26:14.146
Man, slim, go get him $15,000 cash.

26:14.974 --> 26:15.561
Yo.

26:16.585 --> 26:17.296
Shit.

26:18.402 --> 26:19.172
A-ight, then.

26:19.190 --> 26:21.445
Hey, you take care
of them little niggas, hear ?

26:21.473 --> 26:23.974
No doubt, bro.

26:45.259 --> 26:49.601
<i>- Yeah. Yo, you talk to him ?
- Fat man wanna parlay.</i>

26:51.488 --> 26:55.216
<i>- Alright, you good, hook me up.
- Yeah, a-ight.</i>

27:24.973 --> 27:27.087
You check out what I sent you ?

27:30.401 --> 27:32.459
Yeah, your information was good.

27:33.715 --> 27:36.173
So, we can talk on the
real side now, huh ?

27:43.516 --> 27:45.418
<i>Tell your man
I'm good for tomorrow.</i>

27:45.709 --> 27:46.816
<i>Yo, I'll hit you back.</i>

27:46.916 --> 27:49.773
- Now we're cooking.
- Cutting butter with a hot knife.

27:49.816 --> 27:53.373
Next time Stringer Bell takes a
call off the baseline he's ours.

27:53.473 --> 27:54.917
Game over.

27:59.308 --> 28:01.587
So, it ain't what
it might seem to you.

28:02.279 --> 28:04.003
That man there
is my brother.

28:05.646 --> 28:07.639
But if it keep on
like it been, then...

28:12.389 --> 28:13.303
You got problems ?

28:13.550 --> 28:16.224
I stirred up some shit
with this Hampsterdam mess.

28:17.479 --> 28:19.286
That's 'cause
you was behind that

28:19.497 --> 28:21.233
that made me come
to you with this.

28:24.008 --> 28:26.871
Look like you and me both tryin'
to make sense of this game.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.480
Speak your mind,  Russell.

28:43.511 --> 28:44.354
You two good ?

28:46.044 --> 28:46.618
Yeah.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.561
We got y'all out front.

28:50.759 --> 28:51.745
Let's go, p-square.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.220
You look healthy.

29:00.498 --> 29:01.895
For a man who was gutshot.

29:03.678 --> 29:05.508
You reached out to a third party

29:06.341 --> 29:08.967
who engaged me in the purpose
of holding your towers.

29:09.531 --> 29:11.513
That third person's word
was your word

29:11.724 --> 29:13.249
as he represented you.

29:13.436 --> 29:14.093
That's right.

29:14.469 --> 29:17.168
And I ran those
East Baltimore gentlemen off.

29:17.354 --> 29:19.313
I held up my end
of the agreement

29:20.076 --> 29:22.468
at least for as long
as I was physically able.

29:22.843 --> 29:23.548
You did.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.574
Your man then set up
a meet at Butchie's bar.

29:27.114 --> 29:29.561
Your man told Omar Little
that I was responsible

29:29.574 --> 29:32.834
for the torture of a young boy
who was close to Mr. Little's heart.

29:33.655 --> 29:34.582
Your man

29:35.274 --> 29:35.989
in effect

29:36.165 --> 29:37.844
sought to have me hit.

29:38.055 --> 29:40.400
Omar told you that ?
And you believe that motherfucker ?

29:40.423 --> 29:43.156
He doesn't strike me as
a man who would tell stories

29:43.661 --> 29:45.151
even at the point of dying.

29:46.393 --> 29:46.945
Shit.

29:50.511 --> 29:51.977
Proposition Joe package.

29:52.164 --> 29:55.016
The inner workings of your
organization don't concern me.

29:57.526 --> 29:59.450
If there's a way,
I mean, if my man...

30:01.384 --> 30:03.010
if he made
a mistake here

30:03.691 --> 30:05.146
then I'm willing
to pay the cost.

30:11.514 --> 30:12.483
How can we fix it ?

30:13.599 --> 30:14.396
You want money ?

30:15.698 --> 30:16.308
Money ?

30:16.402 --> 30:18.137
Yeah, this is business.

30:18.514 --> 30:20.320
Business is where you are now.

30:21.258 --> 30:24.359
But what got you here is
your word and your reputation.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.642
With that alone, you've still
got an open line to New York.

30:28.300 --> 30:30.188
Without it, you're done.

30:48.173 --> 30:49.512
If my man's still on paper.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.558
I can put him in a spot
that got heavy artillery.

30:53.874 --> 30:56.022
I ain't talkin'about pistols.
I'm talkin' about

30:56.116 --> 30:58.497
mini-tech nines,
shotguns, they even got

30:58.520 --> 30:59.950
grenades in that motherfucker.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.874
That's an automatic fall.

31:01.909 --> 31:04.222
So, I'm hopin' you could
keep that shit to five.

31:05.242 --> 31:06.450
Look, if you hit the joint

31:06.657 --> 31:08.804
his people are gonna try
and take the wrap for it.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.764
They gonna say all
that firepower is theirs.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.153
So all you gotta do is just hit
him with the parole back-up.

31:14.599 --> 31:16.793
Look, I can't make no promises.

31:17.636 --> 31:19.972
- It's gonna be a nickel, at least.
- Come on, man.

31:23.736 --> 31:25.872
- Him and me...
- I'm gonna do my best, alright.

31:29.238 --> 31:30.802
He's always at this place ?

31:32.972 --> 31:34.285
Naw, he come and go.

31:35.106 --> 31:37.053
But it's the spot
since the war started.

31:57.478 --> 31:59.119
He musta done
something to you.

32:02.814 --> 32:04.187
Naw, it's just business.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.671
Almost forgot.
This came in for you last night.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.112
Said she called your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.

32:27.124 --> 32:28.026
She had a nice voice.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.177
Like a kitty-cat.

32:32.297 --> 32:33.105
We're on.

32:35.182 --> 32:36.988
<i>He say for you
to be there, half-pint.</i>

32:37.223 --> 32:38.325
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

32:46.913 --> 32:48.319
Stringer Bell, that's him.

32:48.331 --> 32:50.478
- There it is.
- Yeah, but for how long ?

32:51.452 --> 32:53.340
He could toss that
burner at any moment.

32:55.521 --> 32:56.929
I got Rhonda,
you raise Daniels.

32:56.965 --> 32:57.388
Okay.

33:01.176 --> 33:03.005
Ronnie, yeah, we're
on Stringer's phone.

33:03.017 --> 33:03.545
Lieutenant.

33:03.639 --> 33:07.144
- You should go straight to the judge.
- I'll meet you there with an affidavit.

33:07.167 --> 33:09.734
- Lester's  raising Daniels.
- McNulty's calling Pearlman.

33:13.774 --> 33:14.935
Watch that footwork, baby.

33:15.287 --> 33:15.874
Alright.

33:16.143 --> 33:17.128
Take it to him now.

33:18.113 --> 33:19.146
Take it to him now.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.118
I'm a beast, coach.

33:24.154 --> 33:26.364
Alright, boy, don't
be gloatin' on it.

33:26.822 --> 33:28.616
Yo, when we gonna
have some real fights ?

33:28.628 --> 33:30.306
You know, one of them
tournament things.

33:30.316 --> 33:31.548
Yeah, we gladiators, son.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.637
Y'all got more fire than skills.

33:34.024 --> 33:36.296
You ain't ready for
no full-blown thing just yet.

33:37.199 --> 33:39.803
But I don't know, maybe it
be good for you all to spar

33:39.933 --> 33:41.212
with some boys you don't know.

33:41.564 --> 33:43.627
A nigga step in my house,
he gettin' dropped.

33:44.378 --> 33:47.871
I met these fellas at that gym
over on Pennsylvania Avenue.

33:48.305 --> 33:50.051
I'll see if
they wanna roll through.

33:50.075 --> 33:50.498
A-ight ?

33:51.002 --> 33:52.176
A-ight. A-ight.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.968
You don't return
a councilman's calls ?

34:04.243 --> 34:05.252
I'm off this week.

34:07.577 --> 34:09.277
Taking a little
accrued vacation.

34:09.607 --> 34:09.981
Yeah.

34:10.427 --> 34:11.458
And I heard why.

34:12.867 --> 34:14.626
I'm here for your side
of this story.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.192
If I can't get that,
then whatever comes out of

34:17.215 --> 34:18.880
Burrell's mouth is gonna stand.

34:18.951 --> 34:19.949
You good with that ?

34:21.215 --> 34:22.424
What did you do, Major ?

34:23.597 --> 34:25.612
And why the fuck haven't
they shut it down ?

34:25.629 --> 34:28.339
We've seen that law enforcement
steam roller approach

34:28.360 --> 34:29.817
is just spitting in the wind.

34:29.864 --> 34:32.761
I really think that you're
onto something here, Clarence.

34:32.784 --> 34:33.993
But if you keep it up

34:34.110 --> 34:36.362
before you know it,
they'll be calling you the most

34:36.409 --> 34:37.464
dangerous man in america.

34:37.485 --> 34:40.079
Well, I know it may appear that
we're vulnerable here, huh ?

34:40.184 --> 34:42.309
But if we enforce the drug laws

34:42.509 --> 34:44.688
everywhere else in the city,
aggressively

34:44.947 --> 34:48.101
how can they say we're not
a law-and-order administration.

34:48.241 --> 34:50.306
Now there's got
to be a middle ground here

34:50.329 --> 34:51.501
that we have yet to find.

34:51.538 --> 34:53.695
There's got to be some way
to accomplish this

34:53.766 --> 34:55.773
without turning
everything upside down.

34:56.887 --> 34:59.105
This used to be one
of my worst corners.

35:00.567 --> 35:01.598
This is the neighborhood

35:01.634 --> 35:03.429
where a cop got shot
last summer, right ?

35:03.453 --> 35:04.472
Dozerman.

35:04.718 --> 35:05.528
Looks quiet now.

35:08.355 --> 35:09.835
So do most all my corners.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.074
G-man.

35:23.613 --> 35:24.715
So, what's up ?

35:25.617 --> 35:26.486
Shut the door.

35:32.133 --> 35:33.940
In 10 minutes we're gonna
have an affidavit

35:33.974 --> 35:35.523
for a city judge to sign:

35:36.437 --> 35:38.162
It's for Russell Bell's dirty cell.

35:38.267 --> 35:39.291
It's a good pull.

35:39.420 --> 35:42.493
It is if Bay Wireless doesn't
take five days to process it.

35:43.244 --> 35:44.417
You owe me, Fitz.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.231
That whole port case
came down early behind

35:47.265 --> 35:48.897
some ugly shit in your house.

35:51.075 --> 35:55.273
Now, I don't care how you do it,
but I need my wire today.

35:59.813 --> 36:02.233
These guys were in radio cars
two months ago

36:02.515 --> 36:04.557
chasing calls, clearing corners.

36:05.201 --> 36:07.019
I pulled them to do
felony follow-up.

36:07.137 --> 36:10.786
More police work, less bullshit,
and that's why my crime is down.

36:12.164 --> 36:13.055
My numbers are true.

36:15.554 --> 36:16.469
What'd he do ?

36:17.020 --> 36:18.664
Church burglaries,
14 of 'em.

36:21.495 --> 36:22.036
Let's go.

36:26.515 --> 36:27.067
Mademoiselle.

36:29.250 --> 36:31.548
Is it aff-ee-ant
or aff-I-ant.

36:33.153 --> 36:34.690
I've never been
clear on that.

36:37.963 --> 36:40.988
You been hunting this guy Bell
for a long time, haven't you, Jimmy ?

36:41.892 --> 36:42.819
A while, yeah.

36:44.210 --> 36:45.735
Name's familiar to me.

36:46.779 --> 36:49.899
That the thing that we did
a few years back, was he the...

36:49.935 --> 36:50.698
yeah.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.605
What's done is done, Jimmy.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.910
Now, for your own fucking sake,
just let it go.

37:01.843 --> 37:02.417
Come on.

37:05.499 --> 37:06.589
As the affiant

37:07.457 --> 37:09.907
do you solemnly swear
and attest that the information

37:09.920 --> 37:11.504
contained in this document...

37:11.974 --> 37:14.999
That's the most sign
ificant dropin crime in this district

37:15.046 --> 37:16.020
in recent history.

37:18.962 --> 37:21.412
We still got some hard lookin'
boys out on them streets.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.780
An' Sergeant, them
little mini-motorcycles

37:24.991 --> 37:26.293
they keepin' me up at night.

37:26.797 --> 37:28.144
We're working on that.

37:28.436 --> 37:30.842
I have been livin' in this part
of the city my whole life.

37:31.252 --> 37:32.578
And I can tell you something.

37:32.601 --> 37:34.419
We weren't any angels
when we were kids.

37:34.501 --> 37:37.434
And those are hard boys you
talkin' about, half of 'em

37:37.692 --> 37:39.037
they just playin' gangster.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.512
They no different
from what we were.

37:41.877 --> 37:44.293
Shirts and drawers
a little longer, is all.

37:45.853 --> 37:49.088
The one thing I do miss
about my neighborhood

37:49.111 --> 37:51.118
I'm talking about the
neighborhood I came up in.

37:51.177 --> 37:52.551
See, we knew the police.

37:53.045 --> 37:53.584
See ?

37:53.737 --> 37:56.669
We had a white police officer,
our house was on his beat

37:56.844 --> 37:57.725
on his foot beat

37:58.441 --> 38:01.713
and he would be sitting out talking
to my mother damn near every night.

38:02.112 --> 38:04.195
I mean just sittin' out
on her stoop just talking.

38:04.222 --> 38:07.273
And I'm telling you, this man,
his name was Frazier O'Leary.

38:07.636 --> 38:09.713
He even knew
my grandmother by name.

38:09.736 --> 38:10.592
Yes, ma'am.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.692
Now let's move on to the
tip-line information...

38:12.712 --> 38:13.626
I'm so sorry, baby.

38:13.662 --> 38:15.574
I'm real sorry,
but I was not finished.

38:16.079 --> 38:17.755
You see, let me
tell you something.

38:17.896 --> 38:21.298
I have not seen that
face-to-face policein'

38:21.673 --> 38:22.858
in a long while.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.254
In a very long while.

38:24.524 --> 38:25.497
Until last week.

38:26.272 --> 38:29.733
A young officer, black officer,
came by my stoop, I was sitting out

38:29.896 --> 38:30.988
gave me his card.

38:31.058 --> 38:34.554
His name was Reggie Ballard,
is his name, right ?

38:34.729 --> 38:36.309
And he said,
and he talked to me.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.330
We just talked.

38:37.423 --> 38:39.324
And see now I know
his name and face

38:39.582 --> 38:41.166
and he knows
my name and face.

38:41.658 --> 38:43.676
You see ?
And I'm going to tell you something.

38:43.769 --> 38:45.363
That is how it should be.

38:50.276 --> 38:52.447
My son wants to open up
one of them snowball

38:52.482 --> 38:53.513
stands on the street.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.247
Do he need
a permit for this ?

38:57.723 --> 39:00.321
You ever seen a Westside
community meeting like this one ?

39:00.715 --> 39:02.869
In fact, folks downtown
at minor privileges

39:02.870 --> 39:06.057
tell me that stands aren't allowed
in the citywide way at all.

39:06.565 --> 39:09.896
Now they do say it is possible
to have a snowball stand

39:09.931 --> 39:11.339
behind the sidewalk...

39:17.601 --> 39:19.584
Why are you really
down here, Councilman ?

39:21.047 --> 39:22.958
I mean, this ain't
even your district.

39:23.616 --> 39:24.542
I'm interested.

39:25.374 --> 39:27.275
I have the Public
Safety Subcommittee.

39:32.412 --> 39:33.575
See that buding there ?

39:35.896 --> 39:37.141
Was the old Stryker building.

39:37.915 --> 39:38.947
It was a funeral parlor

39:39.639 --> 39:42.360
the last stop before the cemetery
for Westside white folk

39:42.501 --> 39:44.823
back when there were
still some of those around.

39:44.905 --> 39:46.242
Right 'bout the time that...

39:47.697 --> 39:50.171
Jim Crow was breakin' up
back in the early 60s

39:50.452 --> 39:52.154
somebody ask
old man Stryker, they say

39:52.178 --> 39:57.034
"Stryker, you gonna change your
policy and start buryin' black folk."

39:58.074 --> 39:59.129
And Stryker said

39:59.928 --> 40:02.685
"yeah, on one condition:

40:03.739 --> 40:05.254
If I can do all of them at once."

40:09.324 --> 40:10.051
That's sick.

40:11.000 --> 40:11.951
You know somethin' ?

40:13.172 --> 40:15.017
I had a lot of
respect for that man.

40:16.238 --> 40:17.692
'Cause, unlike most folks

40:18.244 --> 40:19.803
I always knew where he stood.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.385
I'm doing my job.

40:28.956 --> 40:30.504
Look, I done showed
you the good.

40:31.877 --> 40:33.518
Come on, let me show
you the ugly.

40:48.064 --> 40:50.470
Hey, how come so quick ?

40:51.243 --> 40:52.616
Stringer Bell's given name ?

40:52.956 --> 40:53.532
Russell.

40:54.622 --> 40:55.196
For now.

40:56.171 --> 40:56.828
Achmed.

41:03.318 --> 41:05.147
We're on the top
of the mountain.

41:13.016 --> 41:14.541
<i>Come get 'em,
come get 'em.</i>

41:27.773 --> 41:28.477
This is it ?

41:29.176 --> 41:30.195
One of three.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.260
How did you
make this happen ?

41:34.640 --> 41:36.073
I just did it.

41:38.253 --> 41:41.584
I got tired of hearin' folks
talk about what needed

41:41.620 --> 41:42.700
to be done or...

41:43.522 --> 41:45.451
what they would do
if it were up to them.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.423
<i>Got them bottle rockets,
bottle rockets.</i>

41:47.470 --> 41:49.757
So, what, this is about
you making a mark ?

41:51.048 --> 41:54.320
Nah, I ain't analyzed it
all that deep.

41:55.435 --> 41:57.573
I ain't claimin' no kind
of victory, neither.

41:58.535 --> 42:01.549
I will say,
I'm glad I tried.

42:05.513 --> 42:06.650
Go on, Councilman.

42:08.469 --> 42:09.793
I'll wait for you down here.

42:11.155 --> 42:12.210
You're not comin' ?

42:14.497 --> 42:16.258
What you're gonna
see ain't pretty.

42:17.032 --> 42:18.206
But you're safe.

42:18.910 --> 42:20.305
<i>W.M.D'S.,
Got them W.M.D'S.</i>

42:20.316 --> 42:22.616
Think you need to take
this journey your ownself.

42:30.529 --> 42:32.440
<i>Yellow tops.
Yellow tops, right here.</i>

43:07.652 --> 43:09.013
I ordered one for you.

43:10.526 --> 43:11.066
Thanks.

43:13.045 --> 43:14.065
Surprised I called ?

43:14.252 --> 43:14.851
A little.

43:15.965 --> 43:17.186
After the way we left it.

43:19.696 --> 43:20.926
I'm a type-a, Jimmy.

43:22.651 --> 43:24.132
People like me break things.

43:24.613 --> 43:27.839
When I slow down, or when I take
a minute to think about it, I...

43:30.607 --> 43:32.602
Is that your idea
of an apology ?

43:33.798 --> 43:36.412
I didn't drive an hour
up 95 to apologize.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.497
I missed you.

43:45.113 --> 43:46.379
I missed you,
too, I guess.

43:47.387 --> 43:49.863
Still, seems like a long way
to come just to tell me that

43:49.932 --> 43:52.033
then turn around
and drive back down to D.C.

43:52.808 --> 43:54.156
I'm not driving back tonight.

44:02.114 --> 44:03.146
So what's goin' on ?

44:03.621 --> 44:04.677
You working on a case ?

44:05.545 --> 44:06.308
It's a good one.

44:08.066 --> 44:10.156
How about you ?
Anything interestin' ?

44:11.339 --> 44:14.121
I did hear a crazy
Baltimore story

44:14.952 --> 44:17.017
you know through
the rumor of Washington.

44:18.061 --> 44:18.684
Really ?

44:19.587 --> 44:20.279
Some...

44:20.983 --> 44:24.267
renegade police commander
takes it on himself to

44:25.077 --> 44:27.165
I dunno, legalize drugs
in the precinct.

44:28.314 --> 44:29.838
Mayor doesn't
even know about it.

44:30.636 --> 44:31.528
Can you believe that ?

44:32.642 --> 44:33.710
Crazy story.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.281
Someone...

44:36.748 --> 44:38.120
I think it's Colvin.

44:39.644 --> 44:40.348
You know him ?

44:43.518 --> 44:44.880
No, I can't say that I do.

44:47.449 --> 44:49.314
Still, I think
it's funny that some...

44:50.592 --> 44:54.496
water-cooler talker down in D.C.
Knows any Baltimore cop's name.

44:57.989 --> 44:59.128
I was just wondering.

45:09.186 --> 45:10.887
Listen, I'm...

45:13.481 --> 45:15.449
- You're leaving ?
- Yeah, I think so.

45:17.339 --> 45:18.044
Goodnight.

45:26.315 --> 45:28.521
Damn, man, I miss
this crib already.

45:29.973 --> 45:32.368
Yeah, well, you spendin' a lot
of time at the other spot

45:32.380 --> 45:33.881
doin' what
you gotta do, huh.

45:33.917 --> 45:34.690
Yeah.

45:35.957 --> 45:38.772
Man, it's a shame we got to deal
with this Marlo bullshit, man.

45:38.878 --> 45:41.084
I mean if I had taken
care of that earlier, man...

45:41.178 --> 45:42.995
There's always gonna
be a Marlo, man.

45:43.617 --> 45:44.907
No Marlo, no game.

45:46.723 --> 45:48.974
But you coulda dealt
with that shit a little sooner.

45:49.009 --> 45:50.863
I mean, yeah, but
you know what I'm sayin'

45:50.886 --> 45:52.387
don't let it lay
on you like that.

45:52.493 --> 45:56.716
Tonight, I mean, I'm gonna kick
back and just enjoy this view.

45:58.534 --> 46:00.036
I mean, look at this shit.

46:00.188 --> 46:01.573
Can you fucking
believe this ?

46:01.865 --> 46:04.059
I mean, I got a crib
that's overlooking the harbor.

46:04.082 --> 46:06.769
This is the same place we used
to run through this motherfucker.

46:06.792 --> 46:08.693
We had every security
guard in there...

46:08.903 --> 46:09.794
following us.

46:09.829 --> 46:11.050
As they should have.

46:11.062 --> 46:12.915
True, true.

46:12.962 --> 46:14.581
And then there was
that one time...

46:14.616 --> 46:15.204
Toy store.

46:15.297 --> 46:18.640
Hell yeah, I told your ass
not to steal the badminton set.

46:18.686 --> 46:21.439
What you gonna do
with a fucking net

46:21.603 --> 46:24.243
and a racket and we
ain't got no yard.

46:26.248 --> 46:28.454
Uou like, "yo, that white boy
ain't gonna jump over

46:28.477 --> 46:30.209
that counter
and come chase after me."

46:30.221 --> 46:31.135
He sure did, though.

46:31.147 --> 46:32.298
And he said, "whschooooo".

46:32.308 --> 46:33.435
I said, "what the fuck..."

46:33.447 --> 46:35.125
He was on your ass
like Carl Lewis.

46:35.148 --> 46:36.215
Fist was rolled up.

46:36.299 --> 46:38.396
Your ass was runnin' too,
fast as you could.

46:38.745 --> 46:41.197
Punching yourself in the chest
looking all mad an' shit.

46:42.217 --> 46:43.567
That shit was crazy, man.

46:44.236 --> 46:45.854
Right here, too, man,
right there.

46:46.604 --> 46:47.274
Goddamn.

46:49.808 --> 46:52.486
Can you imagine, man, if I had
the money that I have now, man

46:52.498 --> 46:55.500
I coulda bought half
this waterfront property.

46:55.513 --> 46:56.534
Goddamnit.

46:58.539 --> 47:00.239
Forget about that
for awhile, man.

47:02.377 --> 47:03.408
Just dream with me.

47:07.245 --> 47:09.110
We ain't got
to dream no more, man.

47:12.139 --> 47:13.088
We got real shit

47:14.215 --> 47:15.107
real estate

47:15.633 --> 47:16.513
we can touch.

47:24.344 --> 47:26.280
I can't get too
fucked up tonight, man.

47:26.668 --> 47:28.978
I got some shit I gotta
do on the site tomorrow.

47:29.260 --> 47:33.502
Plus, the fucking polack
we got working for us, man

47:34.429 --> 47:35.507
I gotta pull his coat.

47:36.645 --> 47:39.366
If he had anything to do with
that Clay Davis bullshit, man

47:39.390 --> 47:41.478
I'm gonna have to cut
his money, little faggot.

47:42.838 --> 47:43.953
What time y'all meetin' ?

47:50.874 --> 47:52.180
What time, 12...

47:53.833 --> 47:54.690
I think, why ?

47:55.076 --> 47:56.941
You need me to do
something for you ?

47:58.865 --> 48:00.930
Naw, just seeing where
you going to be at.

48:03.685 --> 48:05.046
You need to relax
more, man.

48:08.401 --> 48:09.562
All in time, is right.

48:10.711 --> 48:11.415
I will.

48:13.703 --> 48:16.203
You know I don't take
my work... too seriously.

48:17.891 --> 48:18.769
That's right.

48:22.571 --> 48:23.568
It's just business.

48:34.311 --> 48:35.483
Us, motherfucker.

48:39.233 --> 48:40.231
To us, man.

49:20.577 --> 49:22.606
Hit him, Andre,
go get him.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.124
Come on, Spider.

49:30.683 --> 49:32.337
- Alright ?
- I'm good, I'm good.

49:33.177 --> 49:33.833
Alright.

49:33.986 --> 49:35.030
Alright, Ditty, you up.

49:35.934 --> 49:36.918
You, Justin.

49:38.831 --> 49:40.753
C'mon, boy, I'm callin' your name.

49:45.166 --> 49:47.958
Alright, listen up, we're gonna
have three two-minute rounds.

49:48.228 --> 49:49.553
Watch the low blows.

49:49.788 --> 49:50.691
Touch gloves.

49:55.369 --> 49:56.342
And...

49:57.703 --> 49:58.701
Let's go, Justin.

50:01.115 --> 50:01.715
Come on.

50:02.206 --> 50:03.533
That's good, that's good.

50:07.861 --> 50:08.847
Come on, man.

50:10.289 --> 50:10.911
Block that.

50:10.935 --> 50:13.656
He leadin' left
and punchin' right, Justin.

50:13.692 --> 50:15.333
Move towards his weak side.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.764
He only come up
to your waist.

50:17.103 --> 50:18.182
Oh, man, bell.

50:20.434 --> 50:21.701
That was a quick two minutes.

50:21.713 --> 50:22.603
Yeah, I know.

50:22.791 --> 50:24.751
Get you some water, boy,
and spit it out.

50:28.209 --> 50:28.948
You alright ?

50:29.487 --> 50:30.108
Dizzy.

50:30.414 --> 50:33.019
That's why the hell I keep
tellin' you got to breathe, boy.

50:33.569 --> 50:34.988
So, what ?
You had enough ?

50:35.517 --> 50:36.432
Nah, I'm good.

50:36.725 --> 50:38.297
Alright, alright.

50:40.253 --> 50:42.104
- Let's go, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin.

50:46.188 --> 50:48.085
Jab, Justin, jab.

51:03.157 --> 51:04.307
Hey, we're up.

51:04.577 --> 51:05.376
Here it is.

51:05.656 --> 51:07.699
<i>- It's me, man.
- You heard from the fat man ?</i>

51:07.721 --> 51:08.179
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:08.319 --> 51:10.418
<i>We low, right ?
One mark shy of the mark.</i>

51:10.818 --> 51:11.850
<i>Yeah, it's light.</i>

51:12.288 --> 51:13.403
<i>Cherry says it's light.</i>

51:13.988 --> 51:16.007
<i>Well, tell the man
I'm doin' what needs done.</i>

51:16.124 --> 51:17.249
<i>A-ight, I'll tell him.</i>

51:17.942 --> 51:19.807
<i>- Oh, an' that other thing...
- Huh ?</i>

51:20.088 --> 51:21.649
<i>Them two hitters
you asked after.</i>

51:21.696 --> 51:22.716
<i>They good with it.</i>

51:22.822 --> 51:23.842
<i>Not on the phone.</i>

51:26.717 --> 51:27.232
That's it.

51:28.910 --> 51:29.649
We got !

51:36.763 --> 51:37.480
Good work.

51:41.385 --> 51:42.992
I guess this is pertinent.

52:12.769 --> 52:14.434
Ain't no need
to go back out.

52:15.045 --> 52:16.522
You ain't got
to prove nothin'.

52:16.851 --> 52:18.850
Shoot, my momma hit me
harder than that.

52:19.166 --> 52:20.949
I still got a chance,
he gettin' tired.

52:21.619 --> 52:22.474
Drink and spit.

52:26.392 --> 52:26.980
Ready.

52:27.272 --> 52:29.024
You more than ready, boy.

52:29.211 --> 52:30.148
You a game rooster.

52:31.661 --> 52:32.671
Let's go, Justin !

52:48.595 --> 52:50.237
Is there an alley entrance ?

52:51.385 --> 52:52.771
Boarded up on both sides.

52:53.239 --> 52:55.034
We gonna have to go
through the front.

52:56.477 --> 52:58.061
That's a change
for you, isn't it ?

53:00.274 --> 53:01.695
You just be ready, bow tie.

53:02.246 --> 53:03.712
Know what I'm talkin' about ?

53:12.343 --> 53:13.282
Breathe, boy.

53:13.435 --> 53:14.093
Breathe.

53:20.942 --> 53:21.657
Touch gloves.

53:28.415 --> 53:29.142
How I do ?

53:29.189 --> 53:30.845
You still got
plenty to learn.

53:31.090 --> 53:32.615
But on the heart side ?

53:33.446 --> 53:34.489
You did good.

53:39.345 --> 53:40.613
Go on, soldier.

53:40.729 --> 53:41.986
You done for today.

53:49.376 --> 53:50.989
Oh, I can see it
all clearly now.

53:51.006 --> 53:54.008
Between you and them subcontractors
and that motherfuckin' politician

53:54.055 --> 53:55.625
you all had me
in a spin, right.

53:55.696 --> 53:57.772
- Mr. Bell, I don't know...
- Little man !

53:58.160 --> 54:00.083
We gonna get all
this shit sorted out.

54:00.141 --> 54:01.890
And hey, if the shit
don't come up right

54:01.912 --> 54:04.352
one way or another
you gonna pay for this shit.

54:04.398 --> 54:05.689
Look, I understand you're angry

54:05.712 --> 54:08.400
but at the same time you can see
the progress we've made in here.

54:08.422 --> 54:08.844
Progress.

54:08.868 --> 54:11.730
Now I honestly don't know what
passed between you and Senator Davis.

54:11.741 --> 54:13.829
But if you're unhappy
with Clayton's performance

54:13.854 --> 54:15.296
then you have
to work that out...

54:15.885 --> 54:16.589
Oh, shit.

54:16.918 --> 54:17.927
Oh God.

54:19.123 --> 54:20.519
Oh, God, no.

55:01.556 --> 55:02.695
I ain't strapped.

55:07.786 --> 55:10.773
Look, man, I ain't involved.

55:12.063 --> 55:14.620
I ain't involved in
that gangster bullshit no more.

55:22.274 --> 55:23.517
What you niggas want, man ?

55:25.289 --> 55:26.146
Money ?

55:30.479 --> 55:31.652
Is that it ?!

55:33.120 --> 55:36.545
'Cause if it is, man, I can be
a better friend to y'all alive.

55:39.171 --> 55:40.801
You still don't
get it, do you ?

55:42.971 --> 55:44.544
This ain't about
your money, bro.

55:46.186 --> 55:47.336
Your boy gave you up.

55:49.705 --> 55:50.420
That's right.

55:51.124 --> 55:53.340
And we ain't had
to torture his ass, neither.

56:10.348 --> 56:11.205
This seem like...

56:12.777 --> 56:14.923
I can't say nothin'
to change y'all minds.

56:28.242 --> 56:30.283
Well, get on with it,
motherfuckers !
