05:03.971 --> 05:06.738
what is it like?

05:06.774 --> 05:10.742
Jalue: On a school
day, I wake up at six.

05:10.778 --> 05:15.914
I go brush my teeth
and then I have to go pray

05:16.116 --> 05:19.618
and then I eat breakfast
and then school.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.031
Morgan Freeman: And
then you come home?

05:21.055 --> 05:22.732
Jalue: And then I have
to hurry home because I

05:22.756 --> 05:24.256
also have a Chinese class.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.526
And then I pray and
write my homeworks.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.996
Then I get a little bit of
break time and then I have to

05:31.031 --> 05:34.733

then when it's just 9:00 I have

do it again Monday to Friday.

You brush them every
day, once a day?

05:51.652 --> 05:55.020
Jalue: Twice.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.334
Morgan Freeman: When jalue's
mother was pregnant with him,

05:57.358 --> 06:02.327
she had what she believed
was a prophetic dream.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.997
She saw an elephant and
her baby calf walk into

06:06.033 --> 06:10.035
the prayer room of their home.

06:10.738 --> 06:16.308
So she asked a high lama
to perform a divination.

06:16.343 --> 06:21.546
He confirmed by his own
dream that jalue was the

06:21.582 --> 06:27.519
reincarnation of a Tibetan
lama; Taksham neuden dorjee.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.323
Tibetan Buddhists believe
this guru's soul has been

06:31.358 --> 06:34.025
incarnating through
a series of chosen ones for

06:34.061 --> 06:37.095
almost five centuries.

06:37.131 --> 06:40.766
The spirit of the guru
returned to jalue's body to

06:40.801 --> 06:43.135
continue his teaching.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.838
And that means this fourth
grade boy must now juggle math

06:46.874 --> 06:51.576
and English with Tibetan,
Chinese and memorizing volumes

06:51.612 --> 06:53.445

07:09.062 --> 07:13.899
<i>[Speaking foreign language].</i>

07:14.134 --> 07:16.001
Jalue: It's called yudensu.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.906
It has about 400 pages.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.340
Morgan Freeman:
Listening to it,

07:22.376 --> 07:24.776
I'm reminded of when I was
in like first grade and

07:24.812 --> 07:28.580
we were readying you know,
so see spot, see spot run,

07:28.615 --> 07:30.515
run sport run.

07:30.551 --> 07:34.619
Is it kinda like that,
just doing kind of a rote?

07:34.855 --> 07:37.088
Jalue: Yeah, yeah, kind of.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.625
Morgan Freeman: So let
just ask you now jalue.

07:40.661 --> 07:44.429
Do you ever feel like, yeah,
I don't want to do this?

07:46.366 --> 07:49.734
Really?

07:50.137 --> 07:52.871
Jalue: I have to learn
a lot so when I grow up I

07:52.906 --> 07:58.310
can teach a lot of people
how to be kind and show peace.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.745
Morgan Freeman: But to fulfill
the destiny that has been

08:00.781 --> 08:04.950
chosen for him, jalue must
soon leave his American life

08:04.985 --> 08:07.486
behind to spend
his adolescence in a

08:07.521 --> 08:10.021
monastery in India.

08:10.057 --> 08:13.358
He'll be away from his
parents for ten years.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.995
I've asked thinly woser,
one of jalue's teachers,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.631
to help me talk
to his parents about

08:19.666 --> 08:22.100
his impending separation.

08:22.135 --> 08:26.471
Okay, so when do you
think you will send him off

08:26.507 --> 08:28.707

08:28.742 --> 08:32.744
<i>[Foreign dialogue].</i>

08:32.779 --> 08:35.614
Thinly woser: Yes, actually

wishes he has to go to the
monastery at the age of ten.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.096

That's next year.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.653

08:41.688 --> 08:44.556

like you have 2 or 3 children,

08:44.591 --> 08:48.727
this is it, you got this one.

08:48.762 --> 08:53.532
And now it turns out
that he is super special,

08:53.567 --> 08:58.570
he's not just your son,
he's a child that apparently

08:58.605 --> 09:02.974

But, at the same time he is
beneficial for the community.

bit of sacrifice of their

the date of his move to

13:10.157 --> 13:11.756
Kenneth bae: Well, thank you.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.525
Morgan Freeman:
Where are you from?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.194
Kenneth bae: I was born in
south Korea in Seoul and my

13:16.229 --> 13:18.863
family moved to the
United States, to California,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.665
when I was 16.

13:20.700 --> 13:26.604
Morgan Freeman: So, you
were arrested in north Korea.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.740
Why?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.843
Kenneth bae: They
charged me with attempting to

13:31.878 --> 13:33.211
overthrow the government.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.246
<i>[Laughs].</i>

13:35.282 --> 13:36.848
And, I asked them how,

13:36.883 --> 13:38.950
how did I do
that and then they said,

13:38.985 --> 13:41.286
"through the prayer
and through worship."

13:41.321 --> 13:43.655
Morgan Freeman:
So, were you, in fact,

13:43.690 --> 13:46.691
praying and worshiping
in north Korea?

13:46.726 --> 13:48.626
Kenneth bae: Yes.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.663
I actually organized
tours into north Korea,

13:51.698 --> 13:53.932
and I brought in about
300 people, you know,

13:53.967 --> 13:58.570
in a one year period of
time and pray and worship.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.044
And I felt the calling
to help all those people.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.447
The lord said you're
gonna be a Shepherd.

14:09.482 --> 14:12.450
Morgan Freeman: You feel
certain you were chosen

14:12.485 --> 14:14.285
by god.

14:14.321 --> 14:19.057
To go into harm's way
and spread his word?

14:19.793 --> 14:21.192
Kenneth bae: I knew the risk.

14:21.228 --> 14:25.864
I knew that, they cannot
tolerate anything but their

14:25.899 --> 14:27.732
own religious system.

14:27.767 --> 14:32.103
But I feel very certain
that I was chosen by god.

14:32.973 --> 14:36.741
So, they arrest me and they
put me in the very remote hotel

14:36.776 --> 14:40.078
and I was actually
there for about a month,

14:40.113 --> 14:43.448
being interrogated from
early morning until midnight,

14:43.483 --> 14:46.050
every day.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.866
Morgan Freeman:
Can you talk about it?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.290
Kenneth bae: Was
extremely difficult.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.293
They actually put me in the
middle of the room and they say,

14:55.328 --> 14:57.128
"stand still."

14:57.163 --> 14:59.430
And so I had to stand
still for, maybe,

14:59.466 --> 15:02.066
five or six hours
without moving.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.736
If I move they will come
in and yell at me and say,

15:04.771 --> 15:07.405
don't move, stand still.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.074
But something happened
that I couldn't explain.

15:10.110 --> 15:14.178
Suddenly my hand was
getting warm, my left hand.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.484
So, I slowly opened my
palm and I saw something

15:19.519 --> 15:22.020
sparkling like gold dust.

15:22.055 --> 15:27.525
And then this is when I felt
that god spoke to me and say,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.994
Kenneth, holy spirit
is holding your hand.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.164
He's standing next to you.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.267
And, do not fear
because I am with you.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.804
And I feel so peaceful.

15:39.839 --> 15:43.675
I was smiling, I guess, and
I can hear some of the people

15:43.710 --> 15:46.911
from other rooms saying,
wait a minute, he is smiling.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.646
This is not working.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.648
And then one of the
guards came in and said,

15:50.684 --> 15:51.916
just go to bed.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.851
You don't have to stand anymore.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.486
Morgan Freeman: Okay.

15:55.522 --> 16:00.758
Now, you have been
caught, so to speak,

16:00.794 --> 16:04.996
and you've been sentenced
to 15 years of hard labor.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.864
What are you praying for?

16:06.900 --> 16:08.933
Kenneth bae: I realized
I wasn't going home

16:08.969 --> 16:10.468
any time soon.

16:10.503 --> 16:15.473
And then I said this prayer,
lord you know my heart.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.676
I want to go home but I
give up my right to go home.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.679
Use me here as a missionary.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.481
Morgan Freeman: And, he did.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.752
Kenneth bae: And, god did,
quite a bit after that.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.622
I started having more
conversations with the guards.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.192
I started to become their
friends and more like,

16:34.227 --> 16:36.928
became a Shepherd to them.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.731
On the guards, ask
me this question,

16:39.766 --> 16:45.403
you say god is for real then
how come you're still here?

16:45.438 --> 16:49.173
And I said, because god
may have a different plan.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.343
That plan may include you
because without me how are you

16:52.379 --> 16:54.278
going to hear about god?

16:54.314 --> 16:57.081
And he said, it's true, I
never heard anything like this

16:57.117 --> 17:00.218
before in my life.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.056
Morgan Freeman: After
two grueling years,

17:05.090 --> 17:09.460
U.S. officials finally
arranged Kenneth's release.

17:09.496 --> 17:13.431
His mother was there to
welcome him home to America.

17:13.465 --> 17:19.771
You know you have gone through
this horrific experience,

17:19.806 --> 17:22.240
literally, in the name of god.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.444
A lot of saints,
prophets, even Jesus,

17:26.479 --> 17:31.082
have gone through
like circumstances.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.185
Do you ever think
about that and wonder what

17:34.220 --> 17:36.421
your future looks like?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.389
Kenneth bae: One
person told me,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.725
Jesus is a hope
to live my life for.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.127
I just want to be the
channel of the blessing,

17:43.163 --> 17:47.298
and become a bridge to those
people who are in need.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.011
Morgan Freeman: It's
quite an amazing story.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.468
Kenneth bae: Why thank you.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.403
Morgan Freeman: I'm
glad you're back.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.706
Kenneth bae: Lord bless you.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.211
Morgan Freeman: Kenneth knew
the risk he was taking by

18:00.246 --> 18:02.914
going to north Korea to
do missionary work but,

18:02.949 --> 18:05.016
he was willing to take
that risk because he felt

18:05.051 --> 18:07.518
chosen by god.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.986
He heard god.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.255
God spoke to him.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.125
And, that gave him the
strength to endure extreme

18:14.160 --> 18:16.894
physical and mental anguish.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.865
Now, I'm not saying that he's
a prophet or anything like that

18:20.900 --> 18:24.969
but, his story echoes the men
and women, over the centuries,

18:25.004 --> 18:29.507
who were willing to sacrifice
themselves for their faith,

18:29.542 --> 18:33.811
because they believe
that god chose them.

18:34.514 --> 18:38.082
One of those people
was named hussain ibn Ali.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.886
And his sacrifice to keep his
religion on the right path is

18:41.921 --> 18:46.090
remembered every year by
millions around the world.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.564
Morgan Freeman: I've
always tried to stay on the

18:53.600 --> 18:55.166
straight and narrow.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.068
But you know,
the world is full of

18:57.103 --> 18:59.170
distractions and temptations.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.038
One day, you look
around and you find you've

19:01.074 --> 19:04.842
wandered way off track.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.579
Every now and then you
need someone to help you find

19:08.615 --> 19:11.649
the way forward.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.086
That's what the chosen ones do.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.991
They help the faithful
get back on track.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.027
Get back to the path.

19:23.062 --> 19:28.499
Or find them a new way.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.709
Christians believe Jesus was
chosen by god to show the new

19:38.745 --> 19:42.747
way forward at a time
when judaism was suffering

19:42.782 --> 19:47.618
under Roman occupation.

19:49.122 --> 19:53.491
The shia denomination in
islam has a similar origin.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.294
It stems from the life,
and death of a man called

19:56.329 --> 20:00.031
hussain ibn Ali.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.873
I've come to London,

20:08.908 --> 20:11.976
one of the world's
great cultural crossroads,

20:12.011 --> 20:14.478
to meet with
members of the shia community,

20:14.514 --> 20:18.616
and to learn the story
of their chosen one.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.685
I'm here to witness
the holiest night in

20:20.720 --> 20:24.055
shia islam, ashura.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.327
The night that commemorates
hussain's violent death

20:29.362 --> 20:33.831
almost 14 centuries ago.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.270
Sajjad rizvi: So,
here we are at the mosque.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.405
Morgan Freeman: It's
kind of exciting sounding.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.375
Sajjad rizvi: Well, it's
the busiest night in many ways.

20:44.410 --> 20:47.178
Morgan Freeman: With
me is historian of islam,

20:47.213 --> 20:48.980
sajjad rizvi.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.160
Sajjad rizvi: It doesn't
matter how irreligious you are,

20:51.184 --> 20:52.984
you always turn
up on ashura night.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.352
Morgan Freeman: You do?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.254
Sajjad rizvi: Yeah.

20:56.289 --> 21:00.057
<i>[Imam singing].</i>

21:00.093 --> 21:04.462
So, tonight we are
commemorating the day on which

21:04.497 --> 21:06.564
hussain, the grandson
of the prophet,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.332
was martyred in karbala.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.302
And it's his sacrifice
in martyrdom that we're

21:11.337 --> 21:13.971
commemorating tonight.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.421
Morgan Freeman: Alright, what
are we hearing right now?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.646
Sajjad rizvi: Now, you are
hearing the salutation on

21:21.681 --> 21:25.082
hussain and his companions
who were martyred with him.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.251
You often say that, you know,

21:27.287 --> 21:29.220
if only we were
there with you hussain,

21:29.255 --> 21:33.758
we wouldn't have sacrificed
ourselves with you as well.

21:36.062 --> 21:40.865
Imam: We are commemorating
the martyrdom of imam hussain,

21:40.900 --> 21:45.836
which took place some
14 centuries ago.

21:45.872 --> 21:51.409
It was the confrontation
between truth and falsehood.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.982
It was the challenge between
justice and injustice.

21:58.184 --> 22:02.386
It was a challenge between
light and darkness.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.422
Morgan Freeman: As
the evening builds,

22:04.457 --> 22:07.558
the mosque becomes
more and more crowded.

22:07.593 --> 22:10.261
Thousands of people cram in.

22:10.296 --> 22:15.066
So I ask sajjad to take me
somewhere quieter to explain

22:15.101 --> 22:17.468
why hussain is their chosen one,

22:17.503 --> 22:21.138
and why his death
means so much to them.

22:21.574 --> 22:25.109
Sajjad rizvi: So, on this
particular day in 680 there

22:25.144 --> 22:28.546
was a conflict, in
which there was hussain,

22:28.581 --> 22:32.950
the grandson of the prophet
Muhammed and the forces of the

22:32.985 --> 22:36.153
person who had declared
himself as caliph, yazid.

22:36.189 --> 22:40.224
When yazid took power, he was
not really pretending to be a

22:40.259 --> 22:44.295
moral figure who was standing
in the place of the prophet.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.865
Whereas hussain is trying to
adhere to the values of his

22:47.900 --> 22:52.370
grandfather, of islam as an
equalizer in which no person

22:52.405 --> 22:55.706
of a particular race or tribe
has precedence over another.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.319
Morgan Freeman: What
happened to hussain?

22:57.343 --> 22:58.476
Was it...

22:58.511 --> 23:00.044
An uneven fight?

23:00.079 --> 23:02.380
Sajjad rizvi: It was a
much greater force from

23:02.415 --> 23:06.183
5,000 to 30,000 men,
against a band of men who

23:06.219 --> 23:08.386
had traditionally held to be 72.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.422
It's not a fair fight.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.394
After they were killed
they were beheaded.

23:16.429 --> 23:20.431
In most cases the
bodies were dismembered.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.969
In hussain's own case, at
the end he's full of arrows.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.405
He falls from the horse
but it takes him a while to

23:27.440 --> 23:29.740
fall because the arrows
are standing between him

23:29.776 --> 23:31.842
and the ground.

23:31.878 --> 23:36.046
Hussain's sisters, his wives,
after their tents are burned,

23:36.082 --> 23:39.717
they're taken as prisoner,
and taken to walk all the

23:39.752 --> 23:43.421
way to Damascus,
to the court of yazid.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.457
Morgan Freeman: This tragic
event was one of the reasons

23:46.492 --> 23:49.593
for the split in islam between
the sunnis who remained

23:49.629 --> 23:54.331
aligned with the caliphate
that followed from yazid.

23:54.901 --> 24:00.171
And the shia, who swore
their allegiance to hussain.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.508
And on the night of ashura,
they mourn his death.

24:06.212 --> 24:11.248
<i>[Bugle blaring and chanting].</i>

24:13.586 --> 24:15.886
Sajjad rizvi: People
will stand up with swords

24:15.922 --> 24:17.521
and with bugles,

24:17.557 --> 24:19.723
and the whole idea
is it's supposed to evoke

24:19.759 --> 24:23.527
in the mind the battle scene.

24:23.563 --> 24:27.765
<i>[Worshipers chanting].</i>

24:30.236 --> 24:32.236
You have the beating
of the chest,

24:32.271 --> 24:35.306
to have a sort of
a cathartic sense of feeling

24:35.341 --> 24:36.774
what hussain felt.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.678
Sharing in his passion.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.181
Morgan Freeman: Much like
christians turn the sadness

24:44.217 --> 24:46.784
and suffering of Jesus' death
into a celebration that brings

24:46.819 --> 24:50.621
their community together,
shia muslims come together with

24:50.656 --> 24:53.691
ashura to celebrate
the values of justice,

24:53.726 --> 24:58.762
truth and peace that they
believe hussain died for.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.533
In fact, shia around
the world are spreading the

25:02.568 --> 25:06.537
message of hussain
beyond their community.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.706
Organizing peaceful marches.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.876
Hoping to bring the world
together in a time that is as

25:11.911 --> 25:15.846
fractured as hussain's was.

25:16.449 --> 25:21.986
Priest: War's are
everywhere and if we listen

25:22.021 --> 25:27.224
carefully to imam hussain
and Jesus Christ and Moses

25:27.260 --> 25:30.861
and all the
prophets in history...

25:30.997 --> 25:36.867
We should be ashamed of
ourselves that we let wars tear

25:36.903 --> 25:42.907
apart societies and
communities as human beings.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.010
Morgan Freeman: These
are these people who we'd

25:46.045 --> 25:51.849
say are chosen to
explain what god sees,

25:51.884 --> 25:53.617
because they get a
glimpse of it.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.853
Sajjad rizvi: And, in fact,
I think there's a word in

25:55.888 --> 25:57.755
arabic which describes
people like hussain.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.423
The word is wali.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.092
Wali literally means
a friend or an intimate.

26:02.128 --> 26:05.329
Friends of god.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.140
Morgan Freeman: Christians
remember the sacrifice of

26:16.175 --> 26:18.409
Christ once a week
in holy communion.

26:18.444 --> 26:22.046
For the shia, their
remembrance of the death of

26:22.081 --> 26:26.951
hussain climaxes once
a year on ashura.

26:26.986 --> 26:32.189
Their emotional mourning and
physical suffering is an echo

26:32.224 --> 26:36.961
of what he experienced for
them some 1500 years ago.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.364
He is their chosen one,
the one who stood up

26:40.399 --> 26:44.668
for their beliefs,
no matter what the cost.

26:44.704 --> 26:49.273
Remembering hussain and
sharing his suffering is how

26:49.308 --> 26:54.411
they stay true to
his vision of islam.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.919
Chosen ones like hussain and
Jesus led their followers

27:01.954 --> 27:04.989
down a righteous path.

27:05.024 --> 27:11.428
But sometimes the chosen
one's mission goes off course.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.198
For catholics,
the pope is god's chosen

27:14.233 --> 27:16.634
representative on earth.

27:16.669 --> 27:20.204
Some modern popes, like
John Paul ii and Francis have

27:20.239 --> 27:24.375
inspired millions to
live true to their faith.

27:24.410 --> 27:29.480
But back in the middle ages
some popes lost their way.

27:29.649 --> 27:35.953
They persecuted non-believers,
sold absolutions from sin.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.756
And today, there are phony
gurus and money grabbing

27:38.791 --> 27:42.226
preachers everywhere you look.

27:42.395 --> 27:47.164
Is there a way to stop these
so called "chosen ones" from

27:47.199 --> 27:50.601
leading the faithful astray?

27:56.676 --> 28:00.277
In amritsar, India,
the sikh faith believes it

28:00.312 --> 28:02.579
has found the answer.

28:02.615 --> 28:06.450
They follow a chosen
one, guru granth sahib,

28:06.485 --> 28:10.320
who they see as incorruptible.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.458
Kamya arora has come here
from the U.S. to reconnect with

28:14.493 --> 28:17.695
the faith of her sikh family
and to meet her faith's

28:17.730 --> 28:21.565
chosen one for the first time.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.941
Mandeep kaur samra
is a sikh historian.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.209
Kamya arora: Hi mandeep.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.944
Mandeep kaur samra:
Hello kamya.

28:33.979 --> 28:38.716
Welcome to harmandir
sahib golden temple.

28:41.787 --> 28:46.490
This is the holiest shrine
of the sikhs and all the sikhs

28:46.525 --> 28:52.296
have to come to this place
once, at least, their life.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.500
Morgan Freeman: Sikhism is
a monotheistic religion founded

28:56.535 --> 29:02.806
in the 16th century by its
first chosen one, guru nanak.

29:02.842 --> 29:07.678
Today, it has around
25 million followers,

29:07.713 --> 29:11.482
making it the world's
5th largest religion.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.984
Guru nanak has a
vision of a single,

29:14.019 --> 29:17.154
unifying god who didn't
discriminate based on

29:17.189 --> 29:20.858
ethnicity, caste, or gender.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.327
The golden temple
welcomes everyone,

29:23.362 --> 29:26.096
regardless of their
race or religion.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.565
Kamya arora: Tell me why
are people walking around

29:28.601 --> 29:30.267
and where are they are going?

29:30.302 --> 29:33.170
Mandeep kaur samra: They
walk around the main shrine,

29:33.205 --> 29:38.342
from there then they go into
the temple where the guru sahib,

29:38.377 --> 29:41.678
which is the guru
of the sikhs right now,

29:41.714 --> 29:45.215
the 11th guru of the
sikhs is sitting there.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.518
Kamya arora: That is
what everyone comes to see?

29:47.553 --> 29:49.887
Mandeep kaur samra:
They come for an audience with

29:49.922 --> 29:52.890
the guru and listen
to what he is saying.

29:52.925 --> 29:56.560
The word guru in sanskrit
means someone who takes you

29:56.595 --> 30:00.364
away from darkness
towards knowledge.

30:00.399 --> 30:04.868
So he is the one
who shows you a way.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.907
Morgan Freeman: One of the
best times to hear the guru is

30:09.942 --> 30:14.211
early in the morning, so
kamya and mandeep have returned

30:14.246 --> 30:16.947
to the golden temple to
try and get a glimpse of

30:16.982 --> 30:19.716
the sikh's sacred chosen one.

30:19.752 --> 30:21.752
Kamya arora: I notice
it's quieter now,

30:21.787 --> 30:23.420
is that because of the time?

30:23.455 --> 30:26.223
Mandeep kaur samra:
It's because the guru is

30:26.258 --> 30:28.492
asleep right now.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.862
They are cleaning the
sanctum to make it ready for

30:31.897 --> 30:35.599
him to come.

30:38.571 --> 30:39.981
Kamya arora: And why
does the cleaning take place

30:40.005 --> 30:41.572
for the guru?

30:41.607 --> 30:44.208
Mandeep kaur samra:
The guru is the highest person

30:44.243 --> 30:47.277
of the community.

30:47.313 --> 30:54.117
So the place has to be
cleaned for his presence.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.222
Morgan Freeman:
When the room is ready,

30:58.257 --> 31:01.725
the guru's assistant
awakens him.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.338
Kamya arora: So what
is going on in that room?

31:14.373 --> 31:18.842
I see someone holding something.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.144
Mandeep kaur samra: That's
the guru they are bringing

31:21.180 --> 31:22.880
to the golden temple.

31:22.915 --> 31:27.017
Morgan Freeman: The guru
of the silks isn't a person.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.286
It's a holy book.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.455
Kamya arora: They're
holding it on his head.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.924
Mandeep kaur samra: On their
head because the guru is not

31:33.959 --> 31:37.261
supposed to be
touching ground ever.

31:37.296 --> 31:41.832
It's in reverence and
respect to the guru.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.745
Morgan Freeman: The guru
granth sahib is a collection

31:54.780 --> 31:59.049
of hymns from past
gurus, saints and bards.

31:59.084 --> 32:05.355
It was composed to be
recited, and to be sung.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.895
Mandeep kaur samra: When
you come here and you listen

32:11.931 --> 32:16.300
to the singing of
the hymns of the gurus...

32:18.003 --> 32:23.273
The very purpose is to make
you connect with the divine,

32:23.309 --> 32:24.541
the almighty.

32:24.576 --> 32:28.211
The single god.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.782
<i>[Worshipers singing].</i>

32:32.584 --> 32:36.119
Kamya arora: Wow, that
was a surreal experience.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.122
It was incredible to see I
guess so many people wanting

32:39.158 --> 32:45.462
to touch it and be close to it
and follow it into the temple.

32:46.865 --> 32:49.666
When did the guru become a book?

32:49.702 --> 32:51.201
Mandeep kaur samra:
Guru govind Singh,

32:51.236 --> 32:53.103
the tenth guru of the sikhs,

32:53.138 --> 32:58.342
he designated that the
scripture as the next guru.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.877
And he after that did
away with the personal

33:00.913 --> 33:03.347
guruship in sikhism.

33:03.382 --> 33:08.218
The scripture has a
personality in the literal

33:08.253 --> 33:09.886
sense of the word.

33:09.922 --> 33:15.826
It's a person, not a book,
because this was eternal word

33:15.861 --> 33:17.995
of his predecessors.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.697
It's revealed
to them therefore it

33:20.733 --> 33:25.302
cannot be corrupted.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.144
Morgan Freeman: It might
seem strange to follow a

33:34.179 --> 33:36.213
chosen one that's
made of ink and paper,

33:36.248 --> 33:37.948
not flesh and blood.

33:37.983 --> 33:41.551
But for the sikhs,
the 11th and eternal guru has

33:41.587 --> 33:44.154
one great advantage.

33:44.189 --> 33:49.026
It has no earthly desires,
no carnal distractions.

33:49.695 --> 33:53.563
It is the incorruptible
word of god.

33:53.599 --> 33:59.002
It illuminates, unwavering,
the path to righteousness.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.808
Around the world,
chosen ones keep the faithful

34:04.843 --> 34:08.210
close to god, close to his will.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.746
But chosen ones
also drive them to

34:10.783 --> 34:14.083
transcend human limitations.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.085
To become god-like.

34:25.728 --> 34:29.196
Morgan Freeman: Churches are
designed to be awe-inspiring,

34:29.231 --> 34:31.532
towering towards the heavens,

34:31.567 --> 34:34.768
reminding us
of the man upstairs.

34:34.804 --> 34:37.737
And just as they
reach for new heights,

34:37.773 --> 34:41.507
so they encourage
us to do the same.

34:41.543 --> 34:46.547
I think chosen ones serve
much the same purpose.

34:46.715 --> 34:50.684
Their lives offer us a
glimpse of god's power.

34:50.719 --> 34:54.922
Encouraging us to attempt
things that we at first

34:54.956 --> 34:58.992
thought were impossible.

35:07.303 --> 35:10.337
Every year, in Thailand, men
who believe they have been

35:10.372 --> 35:15.309
chosen by taoist gods
perform superhuman rituals.

35:15.344 --> 35:18.679
They endure what
look to outsiders like

35:18.714 --> 35:21.315
horrific body piercings.

35:21.350 --> 35:23.951
They do it to
cleanse and reinvigorate

35:23.986 --> 35:27.354
their entire communities.

35:28.858 --> 35:31.959
Sociologist Dr. Andreas
Schneider has come to

35:31.994 --> 35:36.396
Phuket, Thailand,
to study these chosen few,

35:36.432 --> 35:39.500
known as the ma song,
as they take part in the nine

35:39.535 --> 35:42.970
emperor gods festival.

35:46.075 --> 35:47.986
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Welcome to one of the oldest

35:48.010 --> 35:49.143
shrines in Phuket.

35:49.178 --> 35:50.455
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
One of the oldest?

35:50.479 --> 35:51.957
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Yes, it's over a century.

35:51.981 --> 35:53.280
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Wow.

35:53.315 --> 35:55.582
Morgan Freeman: Karuee
chotithamaporn is a

35:55.618 --> 35:59.586
representative from the
bang liao dou mu gong shrine,

35:59.622 --> 36:01.488
a center for taoist worship.

36:01.524 --> 36:03.068
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
They are many figures here.

36:03.092 --> 36:05.058
Are they all different gods?

36:05.094 --> 36:08.028
Karudee chotithamaporn: Yes,
they are all different gods.

36:08.063 --> 36:10.430
Dr. Andreas Schneider: How do
they relate to the processions

36:10.466 --> 36:11.732
in the street?

36:11.767 --> 36:14.007
Karudee chotithamaporn: The
purpose for street procession

36:14.036 --> 36:18.372
is actually to bless the
general public by the gods

36:18.407 --> 36:20.474
through the mediums.

36:20.509 --> 36:22.943
Dr. Andreas Schneider: The
medium is of course a mediator

36:22.978 --> 36:26.013
between the gods and the people.

36:26.048 --> 36:30.884
Could we speak to
one of these mediums?

36:37.693 --> 36:39.960
Karudee chotithamaporn:
This is the mediums and his

36:39.995 --> 36:41.161
name is kot.

36:41.197 --> 36:42.429
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Kot.

36:42.464 --> 36:44.097
<i>[Foreign dialogue].</i>

36:44.133 --> 36:46.166
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
One of the big questions for

36:46.202 --> 36:47.646
everyone watching this
festival is of course,

36:47.670 --> 36:49.736
the ma song are
piercing their cheeks.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.405
Why are people doing that?

36:51.440 --> 36:54.741
<i>[Foreign dialogue].</i>

36:54.777 --> 36:56.555
Karudee chotithamaporn:
It is ordered by the deity

36:56.579 --> 36:57.678
or the gods.

36:57.713 --> 36:59.713
What kind of weapon he
has to use and where to

36:59.748 --> 37:03.684
Pierce from the gods,
all from the gods.

37:03.719 --> 37:06.453
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
So what I would like to ask him

37:06.488 --> 37:09.690
is why he was chosen
to become a ma song?

37:09.725 --> 37:13.260
<i>[Foreign dialogue].</i>

37:13.295 --> 37:14.873
Karudee chotithamaporn:
He say it's not his choice,

37:14.897 --> 37:19.032
but it's the gods will.

37:21.103 --> 37:23.804
Morgan Freeman: Kot has
invited Andreas and karudee to

37:23.839 --> 37:26.173
come see him in
the shrine's procession

37:26.208 --> 37:29.576
the following morning.

37:36.485 --> 37:38.218
Karudee chotithamaporn:
This year,

37:38.254 --> 37:39.953
we are going to have
around 800 mediums.

37:39.989 --> 37:42.356
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Yes.

37:43.592 --> 37:45.237
Karudee chotithamaporn:
People are yelling,

37:45.261 --> 37:47.794
and they bang the table that
means they're entering trance.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.363
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Yes.

37:49.398 --> 37:52.366
<i>[Screaming]</i>

37:59.508 --> 38:01.842
Karudee chotithamaporn:
So actually the drum helps the

38:01.877 --> 38:03.844
mediums to enter trance.

38:03.879 --> 38:05.090
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
Makes perfect sense.

38:05.114 --> 38:08.682
Rhythm is a central part
for entering the trance,

38:08.717 --> 38:11.018
and you feel the
vibration as well.

38:11.053 --> 38:14.855
Karudee chotithamaporn:
He cannot wait.

38:15.557 --> 38:16.701
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
Oh, it's kot?

38:16.725 --> 38:18.558
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Yes, it's happening.

38:18.594 --> 38:19.771
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
Oh my goodness.

38:19.795 --> 38:22.996
It just happened.

38:23.265 --> 38:25.198
Yes, oh yeah,
he's shaking his head.

38:25.234 --> 38:26.511
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Yeah, that's right.

38:26.535 --> 38:28.969
Morgan Freeman: When ma song
violently shake their heads,

38:29.004 --> 38:33.240
like kot is doing, it's a
sign they are in trance and

38:33.275 --> 38:36.943
possessed by the gods.

38:36.979 --> 38:41.448
And it means they are
ready to be pierced.

38:41.483 --> 38:46.186
Some use Spears, others needles.

38:46.221 --> 38:49.723
Kot's piercing is more unusual.

38:49.758 --> 38:51.136
Dr. Andreas Schneider:
Oh my goodness.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.561
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Oh wow, yeah, his piercing...

38:54.596 --> 38:56.541
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Oh,
so he's taking the umbrella

38:56.565 --> 38:57.864
through the tongue?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.599
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Yes, as you can see

38:59.635 --> 39:00.967
there's no bleeding.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.569
And we believe that the deity...

39:02.604 --> 39:04.237
Dr. Andreas Schneider: Yes.

39:04.273 --> 39:05.550
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Possess the medium.

39:05.574 --> 39:06.907
They are not themselves.

39:06.942 --> 39:08.520
Dr. Andreas Schneider: So,
the medium becomes godlike...

39:08.544 --> 39:09.954
Karudee chotithamaporn:
Yeah, that's right.

39:09.978 --> 39:11.389
Dr. Andreas Schneider: And
for that reason doesn't bleed.

39:11.413 --> 39:13.058
Karudee chotithamaporn: That's
right, it's the possessing.

39:13.082 --> 39:15.060
Morgan Freeman: After the
800 chosen ma song from the

39:15.084 --> 39:16.661

march through the streets

That sounds miraculous, but

42:07.222 --> 42:09.222
It's like a church.

This is where the white
buffalo calf woman brought the

42:12.227 --> 42:15.962
sacred pipe to our people.

42:20.736 --> 42:24.905
So the story is that
19 generations ago,

42:24.940 --> 42:26.773
our people were camped here.

42:26.808 --> 42:29.743
At the time there
was no more food,

42:29.778 --> 42:33.246
because people
were abusing life.

42:35.317 --> 42:38.885
From a distance
they saw a cloud.

42:38.921 --> 42:42.455
And then from that
cloud there's a woman.

42:42.491 --> 42:45.492
She brought the sacred pipe.

42:45.527 --> 42:49.696
She said, I'm bringing
this sacred bundle to you.

42:49.731 --> 42:53.800
That you shall live

chief arvo's people how to
respect mother earth and

43:11.053 --> 43:16.323
worship the great spirit with

43:17.693 --> 43:19.025
Does it still exist?

43:19.061 --> 43:20.327
Chief arvol: Yes.

43:20.362 --> 43:24.064
Since the age of 12 years old,
I've been the keeper of the

43:24.099 --> 43:27.634
sacred white buffalo
calf bundle or pipe.

43:27.669 --> 43:30.103
They call me canupa a wayanka.

Morgan Freeman:
Chanupa a wayanka.

43:31.673 --> 43:34.874
Chief arvol: Mmm, me.

43:35.010 --> 43:37.944
Morgan Freeman: The white
buffalo calf pipe is so sacred

43:37.980 --> 43:40.180
that chief arvol
cannot let anyone outside

43:40.215 --> 43:42.782
his tribes see it.

43:42.818 --> 43:45.952
So your grandmother was
the keeper of the pipe.

43:45.988 --> 43:47.821
Chief arvol: Yes.

43:47.856 --> 43:52.225
Morgan Freeman: She said that
you were to be next in line.

43:52.260 --> 43:53.994
Chief arvol: Yes.

43:54.029 --> 43:56.763
My grandmother on her death bed,

43:56.798 --> 44:00.667
she told my family we
are at the crossroads.

44:00.702 --> 44:04.871
Earth changes, climate changes
and that if the people don't

44:04.906 --> 44:10.143
straighten up, then he shall
be the last bundle keeper.

44:11.446 --> 44:14.247
Chief arvol: And it was very
shortly after that she crossed

44:14.282 --> 44:18.985
over into the spirit world.

44:22.991 --> 44:25.825
Morgan Freeman: At 12
you were now a chosen one.

44:25.861 --> 44:27.594
How did you feel?

44:27.629 --> 44:30.497
Chief arvol: I was
pretty overwhelmed.

44:30.532 --> 44:34.067
I was ashamed because our
ways were still outlawed and

44:34.102 --> 44:36.770
we couldn't talk
about this openly.

44:36.805 --> 44:40.273
So I became a
professional "bronc" rider.

44:40.308 --> 44:42.509
Morgan Freeman: You
went off the beaten path.

44:42.544 --> 44:45.979
You went and did something you
had no business really doing,

44:46.014 --> 44:50.316
'cause you left your
responsibilities.

44:50.352 --> 44:54.120
Chief arvol: Yes and in 1983
this horse jumped out of the

44:54.156 --> 44:57.590
bucking shoot, took about
two jumps and went straight up

44:57.626 --> 45:00.126
in the air, took a flip and...

45:04.266 --> 45:07.467
All I remember is that
horse came right on top of me.

45:07.502 --> 45:11.838
Next thing I remember
I was in the hospital.

45:11.873 --> 45:15.108
They told me that I was
paralyzed neck on down.

45:15.143 --> 45:18.378
At first I was thinking
about this, how can I live?

45:18.413 --> 45:20.647
Then I got a telephone call.

45:20.682 --> 45:23.850
And said, this is
your grandmother.

45:23.885 --> 45:25.819
Morgan Freeman: I thought
your grandmother died?

45:25.854 --> 45:28.354
Chief arvol: Oh it was
a spirit grandmother.

45:28.390 --> 45:29.823
Morgan Freeman: Oh, oh, oh.

45:29.858 --> 45:31.658
Chief arvol: Now she
really chewed me out.

45:31.693 --> 45:34.461
You're supposed to be taking
care of the sacred bundle,

45:34.496 --> 45:37.530
but you are laying
here like this.

45:37.566 --> 45:39.966
And we're going to
give your life back.

45:40.001 --> 45:43.937
Right after that my legs
start like tingling and

45:43.972 --> 45:47.574
within days I walked
out of the hospital.

45:49.044 --> 45:50.621
Morgan Freeman: You
come out of the hospital.

45:50.645 --> 45:52.679
You embraced your
role as the chosen one.

45:52.714 --> 45:53.680

46:09.464 --> 46:14.134

calf woman told us.

46:14.169 --> 46:17.270
Because we are at
the crossroads,

46:17.305 --> 46:20.540
either be faced
with a lot of chaos,

46:20.575 --> 46:25.645
disasters or we
could unite spiritually in

46:25.680 --> 46:28.414
this global community,

46:28.450 --> 46:31.184
because mother
earth is our source of live,

we're not going
to back down either.

you having that fight?

Chief arvol: They're trying
to lay that pipeline and

47:24.005 --> 47:26.372
it's going to
ruin all that water.

New Orleans is.

47:31.346 --> 47:32.712
Then it goes into the big water.

47:32.747 --> 47:34.414
Morgan Freeman:

47:34.449 --> 47:37.283

a message we are here still

47:37.319 --> 47:39.319
maintaining the cycle of life.

47:39.354 --> 47:43.189
We take care of the

48:33.441 --> 48:36.743
have people like him among us.

48:36.778 --> 48:41.881
I certainly hope he's
not the last of his kind.

48:41.917 --> 48:46.920
His energy and passion
for the land, our world,

48:47.389 --> 48:51.891
the planet, is infectious.

48:51.927 --> 48:54.894
And I think he'll do what
other great leaders have

48:54.930 --> 48:59.332
always done, inspire others
to follow in his footsteps.

49:08.410 --> 49:12.578
Most of us are too
busy holding down jobs

49:12.614 --> 49:15.415
to see the really big
picture of what we're doing

49:15.450 --> 49:18.918
as a people, as a species.

49:18.954 --> 49:22.455
Religion allows some
people to step forward.

49:22.490 --> 49:24.390
Chosen people.

49:24.426 --> 49:29.562
People who feel they are
chosen to sacrifice themselves.

49:30.966 --> 49:36.502
People who risk grave danger
to show us the right path.

49:36.938 --> 49:41.307
Their goal is to get a
glimpse of god's view of the

49:41.343 --> 49:46.245
world so they can teach the
rest of us what that means.

49:47.349 --> 49:54.020
Whatever their faith may be,
I know we need people like that.
