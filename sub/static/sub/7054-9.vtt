00:22.434 --> 00:23.968
Since you got back
from the other side,

00:24.036 --> 00:25.870
it's like you're a completely
different person.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.372
Olivia, she has a message for you.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.875
She's trapped
in the other universe.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.243
Olivia's back.

00:32.244 --> 00:35.146
They think she had
some kind of seizure.

00:35.214 --> 00:37.949
If it wasn't for you,
I would never have made it back.

00:38.016 --> 00:39.884
You saved my life.

00:42.187 --> 00:44.372
Final boarding call

00:44.456 --> 00:47.525
for Eastbound Express
on track 18.

00:47.576 --> 00:49.093
Final boarding call.

00:49.161 --> 00:53.130
Eastbound Express, track 18.

01:02.207 --> 01:03.374
Excuse me.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.176
I'm sorry.
So, so sorry.

02:09.741 --> 02:11.709
Yes, hello. Sure.

02:11.777 --> 02:16.213
Yes, uh, there's a man here
in need of medical attention...

02:16.281 --> 02:20.251
5776 Dower Street.

02:20.319 --> 02:22.320
Yeah, he's injured very badly.
Please hurry.

02:22.387 --> 02:24.288
Cheers.

02:40.572 --> 02:43.524
I'm so sorry, sir.

02:43.609 --> 02:46.277
But, uh...

02:46.328 --> 02:47.745
There's no other way.

03:23.181 --> 03:24.481
There's no details on this one.

03:24.516 --> 03:26.033
Never a good sign.

03:27.653 --> 03:30.655
Hello? Did somebody call 911?

03:32.524 --> 03:34.325
Someone call 911?

03:34.393 --> 03:36.394
Hello?

03:40.165 --> 03:41.916
Call this in.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.535
Dispatch, we're looking at
a possible homicide.

03:44.603 --> 03:46.404
Requesting backup.

03:46.471 --> 03:47.672
Copy that.

03:47.673 --> 03:50.441
Stand by, unit 16.

03:52.344 --> 03:53.978
Unit 16, backup's en route
to your location.

03:54.046 --> 03:55.346
10 minutes out.

03:59.851 --> 04:03.120
Oh, my God.

04:03.188 --> 04:05.656
Joe, someone cut
this guy's heart out.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.758
Get in here.

04:09.461 --> 04:12.897
Don't...
don't let me die.

04:18.670 --> 04:20.671
Passengers holding monthly passes

04:20.738 --> 04:23.074
may pick up commuter
express tickets

04:23.141 --> 04:25.810
at ticket window seven.

04:25.877 --> 04:27.511
Commuter express tickets,
ticket window seven.

04:31.583 --> 04:34.418
Baggage service desk,
call 2133.

04:34.469 --> 04:36.854
Baggage service desk,
call 2133.

04:36.921 --> 04:38.305
All aboard!

05:04.385 --> 05:07.854
Guess you weren't expecting me
back so soon.

05:07.922 --> 05:10.674
Which led me to believe
that Walternate's main priority

05:10.758 --> 05:13.794
was learning how to
cross universes safely.

05:13.861 --> 05:15.796
He was using me
to discover how.

05:15.863 --> 05:16.997
Do you think he's close?

05:16.998 --> 05:19.266
His tests enabled him
to synthesize cortexiphan,

05:19.333 --> 05:20.634
so, yeah, I think he's close.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.502
And he is driven.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.970
The way he sees things,

05:24.021 --> 05:25.839
it's his world or ours.

05:25.907 --> 05:28.041
So I understand

05:28.109 --> 05:29.409
that the other Olivia escaped

05:29.410 --> 05:30.911
with a crucial part
of the machine.

05:30.978 --> 05:32.345
Where is the rest of it?

05:32.413 --> 05:34.648
Science division is analyzing
the remaining pieces now.

05:34.715 --> 05:36.082
I'd like to see the results.

05:36.150 --> 05:37.684
Of course.
Once you're back.

05:37.752 --> 05:41.488
You're officially on leave
until further notice.

05:41.556 --> 05:44.224
To say you've experienced
a trauma is an understatement.

05:44.292 --> 05:45.759
You need to process
what you've endured

05:45.827 --> 05:46.893
over the past two months.

05:46.894 --> 05:48.628
I know, but I honestly believe

05:48.696 --> 05:50.330
that my ability to do my job

05:50.398 --> 05:51.631
isn't impaired.

05:51.632 --> 05:53.967
Your ability's
not my only concern.

05:55.469 --> 05:57.871
I'm not gonna deny
that the last few months

05:57.939 --> 06:00.941
haven't taken their toll.

06:05.046 --> 06:07.681
But I made a promise
to a friend over there.

06:07.748 --> 06:10.617
And I swore that I would do
everything that I can

06:10.685 --> 06:12.786
to heal both worlds.

06:12.854 --> 06:16.656
I need to go back to work.

06:26.701 --> 06:31.004
This friend
you're talking about...

06:33.007 --> 06:34.207
What was he like?

06:34.208 --> 06:37.777
He wasn't that unlike you.

06:37.845 --> 06:41.648
He was honorable, committed.

06:41.716 --> 06:44.517
He feared for his family,

06:44.585 --> 06:47.120
for their future.

06:47.188 --> 06:48.622
So he had children?

06:48.689 --> 06:50.490
A son and a daughter.

06:50.558 --> 06:52.626
And he was very close
to his wife.

06:55.263 --> 06:56.763
And they were still married?

06:56.831 --> 06:58.832
Yes.

07:11.145 --> 07:13.013
Come on, Walter!
Let's go!

07:13.080 --> 07:15.148
Coming! I thought it was
in the closet.

07:15.216 --> 07:16.216
Aah!
Wait.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.453
Where was it?
Bathroom.

07:20.454 --> 07:22.155
I'd forgotten that
a couple of nights ago,

07:22.223 --> 07:24.024
I used my cauterizer to remove

07:24.091 --> 07:25.391
an uncomfortable growth
between my...

07:25.426 --> 07:27.978
Less information, better.

07:28.062 --> 07:29.362
Have you spoken to Olivia?

07:29.430 --> 07:31.031
I did.
Called her last night.

07:31.098 --> 07:32.482
She's doing better,
but still recuperating.

07:32.566 --> 07:34.167
I understand
how difficult it is

07:34.235 --> 07:36.102
to be candid with people
that you care about,

07:36.153 --> 07:37.904
uh, particularly
when it concerns matters

07:37.972 --> 07:39.272
that are intimate in nature.

07:39.307 --> 07:40.774
Ready to go?
Yes, I am.

07:40.841 --> 07:42.275
And by intimate, I mean sexual.

07:42.343 --> 07:43.793
Yeah, I got that.

07:45.546 --> 07:48.281
I know this is an instance
of a parent asking a child

07:48.349 --> 07:50.417
to do as he says
and not as he does.

07:50.484 --> 07:51.952
How many ways can I tell you

07:52.019 --> 07:54.254
that I don't want to have
this conversation, Walter?

07:54.322 --> 07:55.689
But you must have it.

07:55.756 --> 07:58.558
No, this conversation, the one
that we're having right now.

07:58.626 --> 08:00.427
We're here.

08:06.801 --> 08:09.002
You understand better than most

08:09.070 --> 08:11.638
the pain a lie can inflict.

08:11.706 --> 08:13.273
Yes, I do...

08:13.341 --> 08:15.241
Which is why,

08:15.309 --> 08:17.410
even though I expect it's going
to fundamentally change

08:17.478 --> 08:18.645
how she feels about me,

08:18.646 --> 08:20.246
I am going
to tell Olivia everything.

08:20.314 --> 08:22.816
Okay?

08:24.719 --> 08:27.787
You're a good man, Peter.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.622
She knows that.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.835
Look who's here.

08:42.886 --> 08:45.138
Oh, it's good
to see you out and about.

08:45.206 --> 08:46.506
Peter, look, it's Olivia.

08:46.574 --> 08:47.607
Hi.

08:47.608 --> 08:50.877
Shouldn't you be resting?

08:50.945 --> 08:53.813
Agent Dunham
has been cleared for duty.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.982
All right, well,
in that case, welcome back.

08:56.050 --> 08:57.550
Thank you.

08:57.618 --> 09:00.704
You gonna tell us
what we're in for?

09:00.788 --> 09:01.988
At approximately 8:00
this morning,

09:01.989 --> 09:03.556
911 received a call
from inside this house.

09:03.624 --> 09:05.375
The caller said
that there was someone inside

09:05.459 --> 09:06.960
in need of medical attention

09:07.027 --> 09:08.712
when the EMTs arrived,
they found

09:08.796 --> 09:10.029
the victim strapped to a table,

09:10.030 --> 09:12.215
chest cavity open
and his heart missing.

09:12.299 --> 09:14.033
But then after they discovered
him in that condition,

09:14.085 --> 09:15.502
the victim regained
consciousness and spoke

09:15.569 --> 09:17.703
and then died
three minutes later.

09:17.755 --> 09:19.205
He was conscious and speaking

09:19.273 --> 09:20.974
without a functional
cardiovascular system?

09:21.042 --> 09:22.208
It appears so.

09:22.209 --> 09:25.745
Lady Fortuna
has smiled upon us.

09:32.453 --> 09:34.521
Where do you suppose
I could pick up

09:34.588 --> 09:37.524
quality imported
pickled herring?

09:37.591 --> 09:39.025
No idea.
Why?

09:39.093 --> 09:40.894
I'm thinking of Scandinavia.

09:40.961 --> 09:43.029
Scandinavia?

09:43.097 --> 09:44.764
The blood eagle...

09:44.832 --> 09:47.434
A Norse method of torture...

09:47.501 --> 09:49.269
breaking the ribs
and spreading them out

09:49.336 --> 09:50.870
to resemble
blood-stained wings.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.906
So we're looking for a viking?

09:52.973 --> 09:55.542
Whoever did this was trained.

09:55.609 --> 09:58.545
These incisions
have been made with precision.

09:58.612 --> 10:01.081
This is beautiful work.

10:01.148 --> 10:03.249
Definitely not a viking.

10:03.317 --> 10:05.785
They were ruthless.

10:08.022 --> 10:10.323
Peter, look at this.

10:10.391 --> 10:12.992
Scar tissue.
Yeah.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.961
He's had heart surgery before.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.832
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

10:28.242 --> 10:30.410
Well, it's impossible
to determine the time of death,

10:30.478 --> 10:31.778
because in this case,

10:31.779 --> 10:33.847
the standards we generally use
don't apply.

10:33.914 --> 10:36.816
What exactly does that mean?

10:39.820 --> 10:41.321
He still has reflexes?

10:41.388 --> 10:43.323
Yes, and yet his heart
was removed

10:43.390 --> 10:44.858
at least four hours ago.

10:44.925 --> 10:47.327
By now, rigor mortis
should be starting to set in.

10:47.394 --> 10:48.761
So we're not even sure
if he's dead?

10:48.829 --> 10:51.131
Well, from what I can see,
he's more dead than not.

10:51.198 --> 10:53.867
Okay, what if somebody
is harvesting organs

10:53.934 --> 10:55.135
on the black market?

10:55.136 --> 10:56.436
Not likely.

10:56.470 --> 10:57.904
This guy's medicine cabinet
rivals some pharmacies.

10:57.971 --> 10:59.172
He's got everything in there...

10:59.173 --> 11:00.740
steroids, immunosuppressants,

11:00.808 --> 11:03.376
antifungals, antibiotics,
pain medication.

11:03.444 --> 11:05.345
Okay, so you wouldn't steal
a heart from someone this sick

11:05.412 --> 11:07.213
if you were selling it.
Who's the prescribing physician?

11:07.281 --> 11:08.615
Dr. Alexandra Ross.

11:08.682 --> 11:11.551
You two go talk
to this Dr. Ross.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.286
Dr. Bishop,
I'll arrange

11:13.354 --> 11:15.321
to transport the cadaver to your lab.
Oh, great.

11:15.389 --> 11:16.923
Perhaps there I'll be able

11:16.991 --> 11:19.959
to discover what made
this tin man tick.

11:24.732 --> 11:26.232
Dr. Ross
is still in surgery.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.636
Okay, then we'll wait.

11:29.703 --> 11:31.838
You know
you're drinking swill, right?

11:31.906 --> 11:33.039
It's nice to be able

11:33.040 --> 11:36.342
to take a cup of coffee
for granted.

11:36.410 --> 11:38.378
What?

11:40.447 --> 11:42.549
You know, when you go
on vacation and you come back

11:42.616 --> 11:44.450
and some things
are a revelation?

11:44.518 --> 11:47.820
Like coffee
or my favorite shoes.

11:47.888 --> 11:51.257
And then...

11:51.325 --> 11:54.994
Other things are just...

11:55.062 --> 11:57.597
I don't know.

11:57.665 --> 11:59.933
My mail was opened.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.501
It's kind of disconcerting

12:01.569 --> 12:04.270
knowing that somebody else
has been living your life.

12:06.707 --> 12:09.209
Hey. You okay?

12:15.182 --> 12:18.017
There's something that I have
to talk to you about...

12:18.085 --> 12:19.385
About her.

12:25.392 --> 12:28.795
I noticed...

12:28.862 --> 12:30.663
Changes...

12:30.731 --> 12:32.799
Small changes,
but they were definitely there.

12:32.866 --> 12:34.867
She's...

12:37.204 --> 12:39.038
She's much quicker with a smile

12:39.106 --> 12:41.975
and...

12:42.042 --> 12:44.210
Less...

12:44.278 --> 12:46.980
I don't know...
less intense maybe.

12:47.047 --> 12:48.347
She said that
when she was over there,

12:48.349 --> 12:49.916
what she saw of her other life,

12:49.984 --> 12:53.052
it made her want to change,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.454
to be happier.

12:54.521 --> 12:56.256
And I believed her,
because that made sense.

12:56.323 --> 12:58.491
There was no way
for you to know.

12:58.559 --> 12:59.792
Everything happened so fast,

12:59.793 --> 13:01.194
I couldn't even tell you
how they did it.

13:01.262 --> 13:04.964
And it's okay.

13:05.032 --> 13:07.333
I'm here now.

13:11.005 --> 13:15.108
When you asked me to come
back to this world with you...

13:15.175 --> 13:16.309
You said...

13:16.310 --> 13:19.879
That you belonged with me.

13:19.947 --> 13:23.049
And so I came back

13:23.117 --> 13:25.852
for you...

13:25.919 --> 13:29.856
For us.

13:29.923 --> 13:34.127
And we started seeing
each other.

13:34.194 --> 13:35.895
And I explained away
the differences

13:35.963 --> 13:40.066
because our relationship
was different.

13:40.134 --> 13:43.703
I thought she was you, Olivia.

13:53.814 --> 13:55.415
Does everyone know?

13:55.482 --> 13:59.819
I reported everything
when I found out who she was.

13:59.887 --> 14:01.821
Olivia, I'm sorry.

14:03.490 --> 14:07.093
You know,
she had a really full life,

14:07.161 --> 14:09.429
really sweet boyfriend.

14:09.496 --> 14:11.164
And if he hadn't been
out of town,

14:11.231 --> 14:13.266
then who knows
what could've happened?

14:13.334 --> 14:16.069
She had friends,
people who loved her,

14:16.136 --> 14:20.606
people who... who risked
their lives to help her.

14:20.674 --> 14:23.943
And they all believed
that I was her.

14:24.011 --> 14:28.180
So, you know, I-I-I can
understand how that...

14:28.232 --> 14:29.782
Mr. Bishop?

14:29.850 --> 14:31.918
Dr. Ross is out of surgery.
Could you give us a second, please?

14:31.985 --> 14:33.353
Sure.
Thank you.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.855
Peter...

14:35.923 --> 14:37.190
It's fine.

14:37.191 --> 14:38.991
We're good.
Let's go.

14:49.136 --> 14:50.436
I don't understand.

14:50.437 --> 14:52.572
His heart was removed?

14:52.639 --> 14:53.973
We'd like to ask you

14:54.041 --> 14:56.642
about the medications that you
prescribed him. Of course.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.312
It was the standard regimen
for transplant recipients.

14:59.380 --> 15:02.215
Mr. Russo suffered
from congestive heart failure.

15:02.282 --> 15:04.650
He was on the list for over
a year waiting for a donor.

15:04.718 --> 15:06.919
He had a heart transplant?
Yes.

15:06.987 --> 15:08.921
He wanted a second chance.

15:08.989 --> 15:10.923
We gave him one...

15:10.991 --> 15:13.893
Or at least I thought we did.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.100
♪ ♪

15:50.631 --> 15:52.265
It won't be long now.

15:55.636 --> 15:57.570
It will be okay.

16:03.650 --> 16:07.119
You sure it's called
the Yatsko project?

16:07.187 --> 16:08.220
Nina says that she checked

16:08.221 --> 16:10.222
Massive Dynamic's archives
personally,

16:10.290 --> 16:11.790
and nothing came up under that heading.
Well, that can't be right.

16:11.858 --> 16:13.825
Belly and I created a serum

16:13.893 --> 16:15.127
similar to this
in the mid-'70s.

16:15.128 --> 16:16.295
I'm certain of it.

16:16.296 --> 16:20.132
We were trying
to devise a method to...

16:20.200 --> 16:21.967
Of questioning someone
after death.

16:22.035 --> 16:23.569
Of course you were.

16:23.636 --> 16:26.405
Tell her to look
under pet projects.

16:26.472 --> 16:29.775
Perhaps the Yatsko research
was folded in.

16:29.842 --> 16:32.344
Okay.

16:32.412 --> 16:34.346
I'm leaving.

16:34.414 --> 16:36.114
Peter's giving you a ride home.
Oh.

16:36.182 --> 16:38.584
He should be here
any minute, Walter.

16:38.651 --> 16:40.185
Evening, everyone.

16:40.253 --> 16:42.154
Peter.

16:42.222 --> 16:43.522
What wonderful timing.

16:43.523 --> 16:45.357
You got the keys to lock up?

16:45.424 --> 16:46.758
Yeah.
Yeah, no problem.

16:46.826 --> 16:49.728
All right, don't let him
keep you here too late, okay?

16:49.796 --> 16:51.129
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Astrid.

16:51.197 --> 16:53.599
Peter, come here.
Good night.

16:53.666 --> 16:57.703
I want you to smell something,
tell me what you deduce.

16:57.770 --> 16:59.171
Okay.
What am I smelling?

16:59.239 --> 17:00.539
Him.

17:00.607 --> 17:02.007
Notice anything?

17:06.179 --> 17:07.878
I'm not vomiting.
Precisely.

17:07.946 --> 17:10.214
By now, it should be emitting

17:10.282 --> 17:12.684
the unmistakable odor
of putrefaction.

17:12.752 --> 17:16.454
This corpse's decomposition
has slowed to almost zero.

17:16.521 --> 17:17.823
So what's arresting the decay?

17:17.890 --> 17:21.393
That's a good question.

17:21.461 --> 17:24.195
Astrid and I isolated

17:24.263 --> 17:26.397
traces of a serum in his blood.

17:26.464 --> 17:28.233
It functions as a preservative,

17:28.300 --> 17:30.635
radically slowing down
cell degradation.

17:30.687 --> 17:31.937
Why bother
to slow down his death?

17:31.938 --> 17:33.238
They already stole his heart.

17:33.306 --> 17:35.407
To assuage his conscience,
of course.

17:35.475 --> 17:36.675
You think the type of people
that would steal

17:36.676 --> 17:37.876
an organ
out of a transplant patient

17:37.877 --> 17:39.044
would really be troubled
by conscience?

17:39.045 --> 17:40.812
He called 911.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.749
If the EMTs had got him
on a heart-lung machine in time,

17:43.816 --> 17:45.083
he might have survived.

17:45.084 --> 17:48.320
It's highly unlikely,
of course,

17:48.388 --> 17:51.089
but I'm betting
it helps our organ thief

17:51.157 --> 17:52.224
sleep well at night.

17:52.225 --> 17:54.092
Well, at least somebody is.

17:55.995 --> 17:57.429
You haven't told, Olivia,
have you?

17:57.497 --> 17:59.931
Nope, actually, I did.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.299
How did she react?

18:01.301 --> 18:03.735
Surprisingly well.

18:03.803 --> 18:04.970
Really?

18:04.971 --> 18:08.206
Mm.

18:08.274 --> 18:11.943
Do you think possibly
they replaced her with a robot?

20:00.052 --> 20:01.052
Hey.

20:01.053 --> 20:02.554
Tell me there's more.

20:02.622 --> 20:04.222
There's plenty.
I just made a fresh pot.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.590
Great.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.925
Bad night?

20:08.928 --> 20:11.029
I had a lot of laundry
to go through.

20:11.097 --> 20:14.232
How is it...

20:14.300 --> 20:16.168
Being back?
It's good.

20:16.235 --> 20:17.669
Yeah?

20:17.737 --> 20:20.038
Strange.

20:21.641 --> 20:24.176
Peter told me what happened,

20:24.243 --> 20:26.845
you know,
that he was seeing her.

20:26.913 --> 20:28.647
You know, I get it, but...

20:30.750 --> 20:33.418
You saw them together.

20:35.254 --> 20:37.756
What was he like with her?

20:40.660 --> 20:43.361
He didn't seem different?
I mean...

20:43.429 --> 20:45.864
Like, happier or...

20:45.932 --> 20:47.666
Olivia...

20:47.733 --> 20:49.267
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.902
Okay.
We should go.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.737
Broyles wouldn't
have called us in

20:52.805 --> 20:54.272
if he didn't have something.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.107
Olivia, wait.

20:58.044 --> 20:59.377
He thought
that she was with you.

20:59.445 --> 21:01.346
I understand.
It's fine.

21:01.414 --> 21:02.514
It's not fine.

21:02.515 --> 21:04.783
Whatever feelings

21:04.851 --> 21:08.653
that Peter had,
they were not about her.

21:08.721 --> 21:10.522
They were about you.

21:10.590 --> 21:15.026
And they were real.

21:15.094 --> 21:17.529
They still are.

21:20.399 --> 21:23.768
Thank you, Astrid.

21:23.836 --> 21:25.504
A cross-state
search of police records

21:25.555 --> 21:27.389
turned up multiple organ thefts
in the last two months.

21:27.473 --> 21:29.107
The incidents took place
in five different states,

21:29.175 --> 21:30.809
but the M.O. of the crime
is consistent.

21:30.877 --> 21:34.346
You're saying the same person did all this?
It appears so.

21:34.413 --> 21:36.448
Any of those organs transplants?
They all were.

21:36.516 --> 21:38.783
And not only that,
they're all from the same donor.

21:38.851 --> 21:40.719
Do we have a name?

21:40.786 --> 21:42.387
We have a donor number.
Names are kept confidential.

21:42.455 --> 21:45.156
17-year-old female.

21:45.224 --> 21:47.125
We've issued a priority request.
We should know more shortly.

21:47.193 --> 21:48.660
Mind if I take a look?

21:50.196 --> 21:53.064
So he's gathering
all of her organs. Why?

21:53.132 --> 21:54.432
There are some people
who have strong objections

21:54.500 --> 21:55.500
to organ donation.

21:55.501 --> 21:56.635
Maybe someone close to her

21:56.636 --> 21:57.936
didn't think the recipients
were worthy.

21:57.970 --> 21:58.970
It says here

21:58.971 --> 22:00.105
after the organs
were harvested,

22:00.106 --> 22:01.406
they remanded the custody
of the body

22:01.474 --> 22:02.707
to the Rosindale Eye Bank.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.309
You think maybe her corneas
were donated too?

22:04.377 --> 22:06.044
There's no photos
of them being stolen.

22:10.349 --> 22:13.451
Broyles. Put me through
to the Rosindale Eye Bank.

22:13.519 --> 22:15.320
Yes, this is colonel Broyles
with the FBI.

22:15.388 --> 22:18.423
I need to speak with your
executive director immediately.

22:18.491 --> 22:20.292
Yes, it's urgent.
Immediately means urgent.

22:20.359 --> 22:22.160
Thank you.

22:35.274 --> 22:38.009
So sorry, sir.

22:45.284 --> 22:48.987
These don't belong
to you, do they?

23:00.182 --> 23:02.033
Good.

23:02.101 --> 23:04.669
He wasn't at home.
We're at his restaurant now.

23:04.737 --> 23:06.304
Thanks.
That was Astrid.

23:06.355 --> 23:07.655
We've got a name on the donor.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.574
Amanda Walsh...
Her family lives in Providence.

23:09.642 --> 23:12.360
FBI's arranging an interview.

23:12.445 --> 23:15.080
There's a light on in back.

23:29.128 --> 23:30.261
Hello?

23:30.262 --> 23:31.596
Anybody there?

23:46.178 --> 23:48.313
Over here.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.259
We're too late.

24:23.482 --> 24:26.518
Please...
Help me.

24:35.758 --> 24:37.593
I wanted to see
how the construction

24:37.660 --> 24:39.895
was coming along.

24:39.963 --> 24:41.563
There was some paperwork
to take care of.

24:41.631 --> 24:44.633
I was feeling fine.

24:44.701 --> 24:47.936
But as I was walking there,
I started getting dizzy.

24:48.004 --> 24:50.639
Next thing I know,

24:50.707 --> 24:52.174
I'm strapped to a slab.

24:55.512 --> 24:58.514
He actually apologized.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.781
Can you believe that?

24:59.782 --> 25:01.650
He said he wished
there was another way,

25:01.718 --> 25:03.118
that they didn't belong to me.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.905
So Walter was right.

25:06.990 --> 25:09.074
We're dealing
with a remorseful organ thief.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.076
Well, that makes sense.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.578
He didn't want
to hurt those people.

25:12.662 --> 25:13.962
It's about her.

25:13.997 --> 25:16.081
He didn't want her organs
going to someone else.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.466
I'm gonna call Broyles,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.868
let him know we're on the way
to talk to the family.

25:19.936 --> 25:23.872
♪ ♪

25:28.178 --> 25:29.478
Walter, please tell me
you're not giving gene

25:29.546 --> 25:30.712
the evidence to drink.

25:30.713 --> 25:33.882
Not until I understand
the long-term side effects.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.817
But imagine the possibilities

25:35.885 --> 25:39.254
if this can permanently
erase cell decay.

25:39.322 --> 25:41.023
Milk that doesn't go bad.

25:41.090 --> 25:43.408
And cheese.

25:43.493 --> 25:46.461
Well, that dream is gonna have
to wait, Walter.

25:46.529 --> 25:48.897
Here are
the Yatsko project files.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.599
Massive Dynamic
just sent them over.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.401
You were right.
They were misfiled.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.070
It turns out that the research
that you and William Bell did

25:55.138 --> 25:58.006
on human-tissue preservation
didn't stop when you went

25:58.074 --> 25:59.208
to St. Claire's.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.109
Interesting.

26:01.177 --> 26:04.246
I think we're on the precipice

26:04.314 --> 26:05.681
of understanding this.

26:05.748 --> 26:07.616
More you than we.

26:07.684 --> 26:09.218
I have a working hypothesis.

26:09.285 --> 26:10.585
Astrid, I need you
to get me something.

26:10.620 --> 26:11.987
I need the organ donor.

26:12.055 --> 26:13.355
Amanda Walsh.

26:13.389 --> 26:14.756
I need her body...

26:14.824 --> 26:16.558
Or what's left of it.

26:18.194 --> 26:20.996
Oh, God.

26:21.064 --> 26:22.764
The only consolation I had

26:22.832 --> 26:25.567
was her passing gave
other people another chance.

26:25.635 --> 26:27.302
Was Amanda dating anyone?

26:27.370 --> 26:29.938
I mean, did she have
any friendships

26:30.006 --> 26:31.473
that were cause for concern?

26:31.541 --> 26:33.609
No, I was more concerned that
she didn't have any friends.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.177
She didn't like school.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.645
She didn't want to do sports.

26:36.713 --> 26:39.715
It was ballet.

26:39.782 --> 26:41.516
That was the only thing
that ever made her happy.

26:41.584 --> 26:45.287
Mrs. Walsh,
how did your daughter die?

26:48.191 --> 26:50.692
She took her own life.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.160
My daughter was

26:52.228 --> 26:54.029
clinically depressed.

26:54.097 --> 26:56.865
Was she being treated for depression?
Yes.

26:56.933 --> 26:58.734
She was
on antidepression medication.

26:58.801 --> 27:01.136
She also did a lot
of group therapy.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.038
She kept trying different ones,

27:03.106 --> 27:04.840
but there were a few
that she stuck with.

27:04.907 --> 27:06.575
We'd like the names
of the doctors

27:06.643 --> 27:08.644
and also the groups
that she was attending.

27:11.948 --> 27:13.282
Excuse me for a sec.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.385
I'll get that information.

27:18.654 --> 27:21.456
Hey, Astrid.
Are you at the Walsh house?

27:21.524 --> 27:22.758
Yeah, why?

27:22.759 --> 27:24.793
Well, Walter's got some theory.

27:24.861 --> 27:26.561
He needs you to speak
to Mrs. Walsh.

27:26.629 --> 27:28.897
Okay.
What's he need?

27:30.633 --> 27:32.901
Amanda's schedule,
her psychiatrist,

27:32.969 --> 27:34.336
the group she was going to.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.004
If there's anything else
I can do...

27:36.072 --> 27:37.673
Actually there is.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.875
That was Astrid on the phone.

27:39.942 --> 27:42.044
Mrs. Walsh, we'd like to ask
your permission

27:42.111 --> 27:43.679
to exhume your daughter's body.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.080
You can't.

27:45.148 --> 27:47.249
I know that it's
an awful thing to ask.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.951
No, it's...
it's not possible.

27:50.019 --> 27:52.988
Walter.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.210
Here she is.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.896
I hope there's a good reason
for this,

28:00.963 --> 28:03.065
given all that family's
already had to suffer.

28:03.132 --> 28:05.801
There's a good reason.

28:09.372 --> 28:10.505
Oh, Walter, come on.

28:10.506 --> 28:11.707
Oh, my God.

28:11.708 --> 28:12.874
That's a person.

28:12.875 --> 28:14.576
No, not at all.

28:14.644 --> 28:16.411
I suspect
it's some kind of hardwood,

28:16.479 --> 28:18.747
cherry, maybe mahogany,

28:18.815 --> 28:21.383
and concrete.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.784
Are you sure?

28:22.852 --> 28:25.287
I know that
these are not human cremains.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.155
If that's not her,
then where's her body?

28:27.223 --> 28:29.725
Likely with the rest
of her organs.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.227
I believe whoever
is stealing these organs

28:32.295 --> 28:35.997
is trying to put this girl
back together again.

28:44.273 --> 28:46.842
It's gonna be good
for you, very good.

28:48.778 --> 28:50.846
We need to keep
your body strong, don't we?

29:12.135 --> 29:13.735
♪ ♪

30:59.824 --> 31:02.025
So the funeralhome
didn't report it.

31:02.093 --> 31:03.860
You're kidding me.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.228
Okay, thanks.

31:07.598 --> 31:10.800
Broyles just confirmed
your suspicion.

31:10.851 --> 31:13.536
Amanda Walsh's body was stolen
before it could be cremated,

31:13.604 --> 31:15.538
and the funeral home
covered it up.

31:15.606 --> 31:18.174
Apparently stealing bodies
is not all that unusual.

31:18.242 --> 31:19.692
Of course not.

31:19.777 --> 31:23.546
The theft of corpses
is a time-honored tradition.

31:23.614 --> 31:25.148
Tradition?
My dear, we've been stealing

31:25.216 --> 31:26.833
from the dead for as long
as we've been burying them.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.918
Perhaps longer.

31:28.986 --> 31:31.087
In the 1800s, grave robbery
was the primary means

31:31.155 --> 31:32.455
that doctors and scientists

31:32.490 --> 31:34.758
had of obtaining
human cadavers for study.

31:34.825 --> 31:37.694
In fact,
the practice was so common

31:37.762 --> 31:40.330
that it inspired
the Gothic novel Frankenstein.

31:40.397 --> 31:41.698
You may have heard of it.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.032
You don't really believe

31:43.033 --> 31:44.434
that it's possible
to bring a dead person

31:44.502 --> 31:46.136
back to life, do you?

31:46.203 --> 31:48.688
No, but not for lack of trying.

31:48.773 --> 31:51.574
Belly and I dabbled
in that arena for years.

31:51.642 --> 31:55.378
But alas,
we never could revive Yatsko.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.281
Peter just loved
that cocker spaniel.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.884
Feel that.

32:00.951 --> 32:04.788
Finally some stiffness.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.856
Okay, I've removed anyone
who doesn't have

32:06.907 --> 32:09.292
a medical
or a scientific background.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.127
What about this guy?
Ellis Rourke.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.362
What group was he in?

32:13.414 --> 32:15.231
Uh, general depression.

32:15.299 --> 32:17.167
He and Amanda were in it
together for almost a year.

32:17.234 --> 32:18.534
Okay.
Hit me.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.905
Age 36, majored in biology,

32:21.972 --> 32:24.374
has an anger-management
problem,

32:24.441 --> 32:25.875
arrested twice for battery.

32:25.943 --> 32:29.579
No, whoever's doing this
isn't driven by anger.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.380
Colonel Broyles asked me
to drop these records off.

32:31.432 --> 32:34.434
Okay. Thank you.
I got it.

32:34.518 --> 32:37.854
Oh, Amanda was also
in a cognitive behavioral group.

32:37.905 --> 32:39.989
It focused on ways
to cope with depression.

32:40.057 --> 32:41.558
You'd think that someone
who was working that hard

32:41.625 --> 32:44.727
at being okay
would get some sort of payoff.

32:44.795 --> 32:47.597
Well, it doesn't always work
like that.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.766
I think I got something.

32:49.834 --> 32:53.369
Simon Waylan, age 29.

32:53.437 --> 32:57.473
Says here that he is socially
and sexually incompetent.

32:57.541 --> 32:59.609
No, it doesn't fit the profile.

33:03.647 --> 33:05.849
All right, I-I appreciate
that profiling

33:05.916 --> 33:07.851
is one of your specialties,
but you could at least listen

33:07.918 --> 33:10.019
to what I have to say before
you just dismiss it out of hand.

33:10.087 --> 33:13.122
Well, he's not the guy
we're looking for.

33:13.190 --> 33:14.490
So what am I missing?

33:14.558 --> 33:16.526
What do you mean?

33:16.594 --> 33:18.862
You said that we're looking
for somebody who knows Amanda...

33:18.929 --> 33:21.297
A loner type who has
difficulty making friends,

33:21.365 --> 33:22.732
who more than likely
has parents

33:22.800 --> 33:24.500
who are either living
far away or are deceased,

33:24.568 --> 33:26.369
which would bring me
to Simon Waylan.

33:26.436 --> 33:27.770
29 years old,

33:27.838 --> 33:29.138
computer programmer, bachelor,

33:29.206 --> 33:31.107
lives alone,
also just happened to leave

33:31.175 --> 33:32.742
the emergency-contact
sheet blank.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.477
Therapist says
that he displays symptoms

33:34.545 --> 33:35.979
of narcissistic
personality disorder,

33:36.046 --> 33:37.313
which means caring
about other people

33:37.314 --> 33:38.614
is not exactly his strong suit.

33:38.616 --> 33:39.949
Look, I'm sorry,
but he's not the guy.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.417
Right.
So why not?

33:41.485 --> 33:43.253
Profiling is not just
about checking off the facts.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.321
You have to weigh them.
You got to feel it in your gut.

33:45.389 --> 33:46.756
So what don't you feel...

33:46.824 --> 33:49.158
He doesn't love her.

33:49.226 --> 33:51.127
Whoever's out there
fighting to give Amanda

33:51.195 --> 33:52.962
back her life,
even though she chose

33:53.030 --> 33:54.230
to end it, loves her.

33:54.231 --> 33:56.566
Okay?

33:56.634 --> 33:59.135
Okay.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.507
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

34:04.575 --> 34:07.844
Let's just move on.

34:12.181 --> 34:13.482
What is it?

34:13.516 --> 34:17.353
Roland David Barrett...

34:17.420 --> 34:18.888
Worked in animal research.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.690
But...
It's not him.

34:21.759 --> 34:24.427
He dropped out of the group
last spring.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.795
When last spring?

34:25.795 --> 34:28.264
Last session was...

34:31.302 --> 34:32.969
April 10th...

34:33.036 --> 34:34.871
The day that Amanda
committed suicide.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.724
Barrett is the only son
of Nathaniel Barrett,

34:37.808 --> 34:39.742
heir to the Stanfield
Chemical fortune.

34:39.810 --> 34:41.878
Ten years ago,
after his father passed away,

34:41.946 --> 34:43.813
Roland inherited everything.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.483
Does his post-doctoral work
on cell decay and regeneration,

34:47.534 --> 34:48.985
but then quit abruptly

34:49.053 --> 34:50.585
because of an onset
of severe depression.

34:50.654 --> 34:53.822
Then four years ago,
he picks up his scientific work

34:53.873 --> 34:55.658
at the Duk-Hee
Genetic Institute...

34:55.726 --> 34:57.025
part of an international team.

34:57.061 --> 34:58.361
There are hundreds
of different researchers

34:58.429 --> 34:59.929
working on it,
but according to this,

34:59.997 --> 35:02.231
Barrett's research
contributed to the creation

35:02.299 --> 35:04.133
of synthetic life
on the cellular level.

35:04.201 --> 35:06.569
I wonder
if he could actually do it.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.137
What?

35:08.205 --> 35:11.741
Reanimation.

35:33.530 --> 35:34.731
Okay.

35:53.016 --> 35:55.417
Amanda?

35:55.485 --> 35:57.553
Amanda, it's me.
It... it's me, Roland.

35:57.621 --> 36:00.422
You... you made
a terrible mistake.

36:00.490 --> 36:01.891
But it's okay now.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.726
You're back.

36:03.793 --> 36:05.761
I always told you
I'm gonna be there for you,

36:05.829 --> 36:07.129
the way you were there
for me, remember?

36:10.867 --> 36:12.801
It's okay.
Hey, hey.

36:12.869 --> 36:14.303
Hey, look at me.
Look at Roland.

36:14.371 --> 36:16.639
Look at me.

36:51.207 --> 36:52.908
Oh... oh, no.

36:54.210 --> 36:55.844
FBI! You're surrounded.

36:55.912 --> 36:57.813
All teams move out!
Go! Go! Go!

36:59.349 --> 37:01.216
Move, move!

37:01.284 --> 37:03.385
Clear!

37:08.792 --> 37:11.760
Go ahead andstart a "V" series.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.531
Where is she?

38:05.615 --> 38:07.916
Downstairs.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.626
Clear.

38:36.062 --> 38:39.081
I was trying
to correct a wrong.

38:41.317 --> 38:42.351
She made a mistake.

38:42.352 --> 38:44.653
What was
your relationship to her?

38:44.721 --> 38:49.324
I just wanted her
to have another chance.

38:49.392 --> 38:53.362
I wanted her to live a life.

38:57.584 --> 38:58.767
Her eyes.

38:58.768 --> 39:02.604
When I looked into her eyes...

39:05.942 --> 39:07.643
It wasn't Amanda.

39:10.513 --> 39:12.981
I don't know
what I brought back,

39:13.049 --> 39:15.717
but I know..

39:15.785 --> 39:18.454
It... it wasn't her.

39:42.312 --> 39:43.745
Is she dead?

39:47.150 --> 39:49.218
Yes, she's dead.

40:06.152 --> 40:08.437
You know what I need
after a day like today?

40:08.505 --> 40:10.405
For most people,
it would be a drink,

40:10.473 --> 40:11.707
so I'm guessing...
strawberry milkshake...

40:11.708 --> 40:13.542
I can do that.
With extra whipped cream.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.110
Don't push it.

40:21.551 --> 40:22.851
Olivia?

40:27.757 --> 40:31.226
Are you okay?

40:39.369 --> 40:41.370
What is it?

40:48.645 --> 40:51.547
You know what Barrett said?

40:55.985 --> 40:57.853
He said that he looked
into her eyes,

40:57.921 --> 41:00.055
and he knew that it wasn't her.

41:05.195 --> 41:07.196
Olivia...

41:12.268 --> 41:14.836
I understand the facts.

41:14.904 --> 41:17.439
I know that she had reams
of information about me

41:17.507 --> 41:18.607
and about my life

41:18.608 --> 41:20.375
and about the people
that were close to me.

41:20.443 --> 41:22.010
And I understand
that if she slipped up

41:22.078 --> 41:25.247
that she would have a completely
reasonable explanation for it.

41:25.315 --> 41:27.716
And I guess to expect you

41:27.784 --> 41:29.885
to have seen past that
is perhaps asking

41:29.953 --> 41:31.753
a little bit too much.

41:31.821 --> 41:34.323
But when I was over there,
I thought about you.

41:34.390 --> 41:37.960
And you were just a figment
of my imagination.

41:39.462 --> 41:41.163
But I held onto you,

41:41.231 --> 41:43.632
and it wasn't reasonable,
and it wasn't logical,

41:43.700 --> 41:47.903
but I did it, so...

41:47.971 --> 41:50.305
Why didn't you?

41:55.311 --> 41:57.913
She wasn't me.

41:57.981 --> 42:02.050
How could you not see that?

42:02.118 --> 42:03.151
Now she's everywhere.

42:03.152 --> 42:05.220
She's in my house, my job,

42:05.288 --> 42:06.822
my bed, and I don't want

42:06.889 --> 42:08.189
to wear my clothes anymore,

42:08.224 --> 42:09.557
and I don't want to live
in my apartment,

42:09.609 --> 42:12.494
and I don't want to be
with you.

42:15.665 --> 42:17.833
She's taken everything.

42:30.546 --> 42:33.148
I'm sorry.

42:54.470 --> 42:57.439
I have arrived.

42:57.507 --> 43:00.509
Yes.

43:00.576 --> 43:01.710
I am looking at him

43:01.711 --> 43:04.680
as we speak.

43:07.283 --> 43:11.887
He is still...alive.
