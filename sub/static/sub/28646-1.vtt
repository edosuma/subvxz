[pleasant piano music]

01:04.650 --> 01:07.412

01:37.131 --> 01:38.512
Simon?

01:39.237 --> 01:40.652
Simon?!

01:40.686 --> 01:42.205
Simon?!

[ghostly whispering]

01:51.904 --> 01:54.252

02:07.368 --> 02:08.955

[horn honking]

02:38.088 --> 02:39.745
- Father!

02:43.542 --> 02:45.130
- Gentlemen, please excuse us.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.545
- No problem, Father.

02:48.237 --> 02:49.341
- Good afternoon, Simon.

02:49.376 --> 02:51.136
- Father, you have to go.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.724
Someone's coming to hurt you.

02:54.104 --> 02:55.623
- Come.

02:59.317 --> 03:01.008
Did you see something
again, Simon?

03:01.042 --> 03:02.561
- He's going to hurt you.

03:03.769 --> 03:05.840
- Simon,

03:05.875 --> 03:09.361
these visions of yours,
they don't always come true.

03:09.396 --> 03:10.776
- You have to go now,
he's coming for you.

03:10.811 --> 03:12.226
- Who's coming?

03:12.261 --> 03:13.641
- [Hooded Man] Father!

03:14.159 --> 03:15.678
You let this happen!

03:15.712 --> 03:16.679
[ominous music]

03:16.713 --> 03:17.887
You knew!

03:17.921 --> 03:20.234
I told you I'd kill him!

03:20.269 --> 03:21.469
- Simon, go!

03:21.470 --> 03:22.849
Into the vestry and
lock the door!

03:22.857 --> 03:24.238
Quickly now!

03:25.066 --> 03:27.207
My son, you're in
God's house now.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.381
[eerie music]

03:31.487 --> 03:33.282
- [Hooded Man] Your punishment

03:33.316 --> 03:35.663
for your killing him!

07:44.740 --> 07:47.156
- [Woman] Simon, are we
going to the park or not?

07:47.190 --> 07:48.709
- On my way.

08:04.414 --> 08:05.953
- I never get tired
of this view.

08:08.142 --> 08:09.834
So how are the studies going?

08:09.868 --> 08:12.008
- Yeah, good.

08:12.043 --> 08:13.354
Finishing the online course,

08:13.389 --> 08:16.357
so I should be done
in a few weeks.

08:16.392 --> 08:18.187
- So you're going to be
a computer programmer.

08:18.221 --> 08:19.568
- Not likely.

08:19.602 --> 08:20.672
But it's helped.

08:20.673 --> 08:21.452
It's started to.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.054
- Simon,

08:23.088 --> 08:24.193
is that you?

08:24.227 --> 08:26.160
- Alison, hi.

08:27.576 --> 08:28.749
- Mrs. Eildon.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.958
Simon, it's nice
to see you again.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.788
It's been ages.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.548
Not seen you since school.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.756
Where have you been hiding?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.491
- I've just been doing
a bit of studying.

08:40.174 --> 08:41.554
Look after Mum a bit.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.422
I've been doing a programming
course on databases.

08:46.456 --> 08:47.941
- Sweet.

08:47.975 --> 08:49.070
- Yeah, it's good.

08:50.978 --> 08:53.153
[somber music]

08:56.846 --> 08:57.985
- Well, it's nice
to see you again.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.573
Maybe see you around?

09:01.092 --> 09:02.611
Bye, Mrs. Eildon.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.411
- Mom, don't say it.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.587
- She seemed nice.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.365
- Look, you know I can't
get involved with anyone.

09:20.076 --> 09:21.561
- Son,

09:22.285 --> 09:23.804
you can't be an island.

09:26.393 --> 09:28.193
You've hidden yourself from
the world for too long.

09:31.432 --> 09:32.737
When I'm gone, you'll be free.

09:42.409 --> 09:44.687
- Better get you back
before you get cold.

09:49.278 --> 09:51.452
[somber music]

10:06.744 --> 10:07.848
- Came out again.

10:12.059 --> 10:14.924
- Dr. Thompson said your
platelet count was up slightly.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.374
So that's good.

10:17.306 --> 10:18.997
- Dr. Thompson wouldn't
know a platelet

10:19.032 --> 10:20.689
from a dinner service.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.519
[wincing]

10:23.553 --> 10:25.107
What's wrong?
[ominous music]

10:25.141 --> 10:26.695
You're bleeding.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.111
- What?

10:29.145 --> 10:30.181
No, I'm fine.

10:30.215 --> 10:31.769
It's nothing.

11:30.551 --> 11:32.243
[gasping]

11:37.627 --> 11:39.699
- [Mother] God,
Simon, what happened?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.705
- I don't know.

11:49.087 --> 11:51.849
It was like a vision
but it was real.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.714
Like it was happening now.

11:57.095 --> 11:58.648
He's back

12:00.029 --> 12:01.582
and he's just killed again.

12:07.968 --> 12:09.659
- So,

12:09.694 --> 12:11.972
if I understand
this, Mr. Eildon,

12:12.007 --> 12:13.284
you're reporting a murder.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.320
- That's right.

12:15.355 --> 12:17.564
- But you don't know
the name of the victim,

12:17.598 --> 12:19.462
where they were murdered
or who the murderer is.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.188
- No.

12:21.223 --> 12:22.431
But I do know how and when.

12:22.465 --> 12:23.915
- Yes.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.607
It was around 10AM this morning

12:26.642 --> 12:28.023
and the perpetrator
used his fists,

12:28.057 --> 12:29.852
a blunt force weapon

12:29.887 --> 12:31.182
and something that buttoned.

12:33.304 --> 12:34.995
And how do you know this?

12:35.030 --> 12:36.325
Came to you in a dream, did it?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.053
Must be hard being
a full-time carer.

12:45.247 --> 12:46.696
Stressful.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.941
Well, thanks for
letting us know.

12:49.976 --> 12:51.494
We'll make some inquires.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.140
- He didn't believe you.

13:16.174 --> 13:17.469
- I sounded like a right nutter.

13:20.316 --> 13:22.284
- What now?

13:22.318 --> 13:23.718
- I'll have to do
something myself.

13:25.321 --> 13:26.806
- Can anyone help?

13:28.877 --> 13:30.430
- Maybe.

13:31.086 --> 13:32.501
If there's someone.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.297

14:55.998 --> 14:58.587
[dramatic tempo music]

16:00.752 --> 16:02.306
Wakey, wakey.

16:05.481 --> 16:07.518
- You were up late again.

16:07.552 --> 16:10.210
- You have coffee, fruit juice

16:10.245 --> 16:12.178
and your favorite
medically approved--

16:12.212 --> 16:13.420
[gasping]
[screaming]

16:13.455 --> 16:14.974
- Simon!
[gasping]

16:15.008 --> 16:16.527
Simon?!

16:16.906 --> 16:18.391
Simon!

16:18.978 --> 16:20.600
Simon!

16:20.634 --> 16:22.705

16:24.431 --> 16:25.743
Simon!

16:26.054 --> 16:27.745

Mom!

17:16.690 --> 17:18.070
No, please, please, Mom!

17:19.555 --> 17:20.348
Mom, please.

17:20.384 --> 17:22.109
[crying]

17:25.560 --> 17:27.460
[eerie music]

17:54.142 --> 17:55.453
- Thy will is done.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.595
Let us pray.

18:02.011 --> 18:04.324

[quivering]

19:53.226 --> 19:55.366
[somber music]

19:57.299 --> 19:59.439
- The ambassador sends
his personal thanks

19:59.474 --> 20:02.235
for the removal of our agent
with such minimal damage.

20:02.270 --> 20:03.409
- Which we wouldn't
have had to do

20:03.443 --> 20:06.135
if the ambassador had done
his job in the first place.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.758
- And that new camera in
your bag's been sorted.

20:07.792 --> 20:10.070
[phone ringing]

20:11.244 --> 20:12.763
- Chatham.

20:12.797 --> 20:14.213
- [Simon] Miss
Chatham, how are you?

20:14.247 --> 20:15.938
- Who is this?

20:15.973 --> 20:17.354
- [Simon] I'm sorry for
approaching you like this

20:17.388 --> 20:19.701
but I need your help.

20:19.735 --> 20:21.116
- Trace this call.

20:21.150 --> 20:23.394
You realize this is a
private government line.

20:23.429 --> 20:25.776
Illegal access is an
offense with a penalty.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.226
- [Simon] In one hour's time,
there'll be an attempted coup

20:27.260 --> 20:29.460
on a small island in the
Indian Ocean that will fail.

20:31.851 --> 20:32.748
- How do you know this?

20:32.783 --> 20:34.371
- [Simon] At lunch time,

20:34.405 --> 20:36.476
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State for Defense

20:36.511 --> 20:39.030
will be caught on camera
indiscreetly criticizing

20:39.065 --> 20:41.447
the Prime Minister and will
have lost his job by tea time.

20:41.481 --> 20:43.172
- Who are you and
what do you want?

20:43.207 --> 20:45.244
- [Simon] What I want
is for to arrange

20:45.278 --> 20:47.798
full transaction immunity
for a Mr. Steve Brennus.

20:47.832 --> 20:49.040
- Why?

20:49.075 --> 20:50.490
Who's he?

20:50.525 --> 20:51.820
- [Simon] You'll find his file.

20:53.424 --> 20:56.634
- Full immunity from all
crimes just because you phoned?

20:56.669 --> 20:58.222
- [Simon] Because of the
information I'm giving you.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.948
But right now, a fellow agent

20:59.982 --> 21:01.984
with a titanium gentle
piercing is about to say,

21:02.019 --> 21:03.434
"You won't like it."

21:04.677 --> 21:06.368
- We traced a call and
you won't like it.

21:08.232 --> 21:10.476
[ominous music]

21:13.341 --> 21:15.308
- Who the hell is Steve Brennus?

21:19.761 --> 21:21.728
[somber music]

21:40.091 --> 21:41.783
[sighing]

21:56.867 --> 21:59.145
[phone ringing]

22:01.630 --> 22:03.632
- Christine?

22:03.667 --> 22:05.467
- [Simon] Mr. Steve Brennus,
hope this isn't a bad time.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.567
- Define "bad."

22:12.192 --> 22:13.711
- [Woman] Steve, I'm sorry.

22:13.746 --> 22:16.231
- How the hell could
he lose all our money?

22:16.265 --> 22:18.371
- I don't know, he just did.

22:18.406 --> 22:20.684
- Chris, Chris, we'll go
bankrupt, we'll lose the house!

22:20.718 --> 22:22.218
- Do you think that
I don't know that?

22:24.757 --> 22:26.206
- What, so it's my fault?

22:26.241 --> 22:27.898
- Well, he's your
brother, isn't he?

22:27.932 --> 22:29.520
- You didn't need
to lend him it.

22:29.555 --> 22:31.004
- Jesus Christ!
[girl whimpering]

22:31.039 --> 22:32.903
Oh, Sally.
- Sally!

22:32.937 --> 22:34.232
Sweetheart, Mommy's here.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.045
Steve!

22:37.079 --> 22:38.874
Steve, call the ambulance!

22:38.909 --> 22:39.909
Call them now!

22:39.910 --> 22:41.290
- [Steve] Okay!

22:41.325 --> 22:43.016
- [Christine] What
are you doing?!

22:43.051 --> 22:44.915
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

22:44.949 --> 22:46.434
Steve!

22:47.089 --> 22:47.952
- [Steve Voiceover] Hello, yeah,

22:47.987 --> 22:50.196
can I get an ambulance please?

22:50.230 --> 22:52.198
Yeah, my daughter's
hurt her head.

22:52.957 --> 22:55.235
[phone ringing]

23:00.102 --> 23:02.242
- [Simon] Sally
wasn't badly hurt.

23:02.246 --> 23:03.036
She and your wife
just need some time

23:03.038 --> 23:03.717
before they see you again.

23:03.727 --> 23:05.142
- What?

23:05.176 --> 23:06.143
Who is this?

23:07.247 --> 23:09.560
- [Simon] 25 thousand.

23:09.595 --> 23:11.700
- Listen, asshole,

23:11.735 --> 23:14.807
I could hurt you in ways
you can't even dream of.

23:14.841 --> 23:16.912
- [Simon] 25 thousand gets the
banks off your back for now

23:16.947 --> 23:19.570
and saves the house.

23:19.605 --> 23:21.917
In exchange for this four
day's work, the money is yours.

23:21.952 --> 23:24.541
- Yeah, not interested.

23:24.575 --> 23:25.680
- The house that Christine
and Sally call home.

23:28.683 --> 23:30.650
My name is Simon.

23:30.685 --> 23:32.065
Please meet me under
the rail bridge

23:32.100 --> 23:33.653
at Queen Street at noon.

23:35.483 --> 23:36.656
One other thing.

23:36.967 --> 23:38.209
- What?

23:38.244 --> 23:39.176
- Have a shower and a shave.

23:46.114 --> 23:48.599
[dramatic beat music]

23:55.779 --> 23:58.126
[motor rumbling]

24:42.273 --> 24:44.103
- That's my bloody phone.

24:44.137 --> 24:46.726
- [Coworker] I told you
you wouldn't like it.

24:46.761 --> 24:48.072
[buzzer ringing]

24:48.107 --> 24:49.211
- [Man On Speaker]
Would you be good enough

24:49.246 --> 24:50.385
to come down to Operations,
please, Miss Chatham?

24:54.769 --> 24:56.736
[somber music]

25:31.944 --> 25:33.393
- Got you.

25:47.511 --> 25:48.754
- Mr. Brennus.

25:50.721 --> 25:51.722
- So much for the
element of surprise.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.070
- Simon.

25:55.899 --> 25:57.590
- So you said.

26:01.974 --> 26:04.045
Okay,

26:04.079 --> 26:05.702
so what's all this about then?

26:06.530 --> 26:08.290
- I want you to stop someone.

26:08.325 --> 26:10.016
- What's your problem?

26:10.051 --> 26:11.086
Gambling debts, sort
a dealer, what?

26:11.121 --> 26:12.881
- No.

26:12.916 --> 26:14.262
Nothing like that.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.646
- In four days time,

26:18.680 --> 26:20.648
I believe a serial killer
is going to murder me.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.443
[chuckling]

26:23.478 --> 26:25.618
Absurd as it sounds, it's true.

26:26.723 --> 26:28.552
- See you later.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.553
- Look, you and your
family need my help.

26:33.212 --> 26:34.454
- How do you know anything
about me and my family?

26:37.492 --> 26:40.357
[somber music]

26:40.391 --> 26:41.358
- During the firefight
in Afghanistan,

26:44.119 --> 26:45.120
you couldn't have known
it would've happened.

26:47.191 --> 26:48.020
Sally had just been born

26:50.816 --> 26:52.300
and you realized you had a
new responsibility in life.

26:54.682 --> 26:56.925
You had to go home alive
to your wife and daughter.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.824
[faint war zone commotion]

26:58.858 --> 27:01.516
For a split second,

27:01.550 --> 27:03.035
you thought maybe it was time
to pack in being a soldier.

27:04.968 --> 27:06.417
So you paused.

27:08.454 --> 27:09.248
And then that
second's hesitation,

27:12.009 --> 27:13.355
the grenades hit.

27:14.874 --> 27:16.117
And that's when your mate,
Spitball, didn't make it home.

27:23.055 --> 27:24.608
- Nobody knows about that.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.473
Nobody.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.305
Who the hell are you?

27:32.340 --> 27:34.825
- I'm the person that's paying
you to stop a serial killer.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.275
It's all there.

27:36.758 --> 27:38.311
Payment in advance.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.869
Do you believe in
psychics, Mr. Brennus?

27:43.903 --> 27:46.112
- Oh, Christ, is
that why I'm here?

27:46.147 --> 27:47.286
- Sorry, if you want a
trip to La La Land,

27:47.320 --> 27:48.908
you're on your own.

27:48.943 --> 27:51.117
- So nothing's ever happened
that you can't explain?

27:51.152 --> 27:52.429
- Well of course there has

27:52.463 --> 27:53.430
but that doesn't mean
I see it supernatural.

27:55.743 --> 27:58.055
- Look, I need your help.

27:58.090 --> 28:00.748
Whether you believe me
or not, you need 25K.

28:00.782 --> 28:02.370
It's only four days.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.034
I'm going to live
to regret this.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.521
[ominous music]

28:18.697 --> 28:20.595
- [Radio Announcer] You're
listing to Spirit Radio,

28:20.629 --> 28:22.321
the nation's number one
medium by mediums for mediums.

28:24.530 --> 28:26.739
Coming up later today we
have an exclusive interview

28:26.774 --> 28:28.983
with Marcus Bryant, the
controversial Leeds priest

28:29.017 --> 28:30.536
who speaks with the dead.

28:31.606 --> 28:33.539
First, though, let's
go over to the weather

28:33.573 --> 28:34.643
and see what the gods have
got in store for us this time.

28:36.611 --> 28:38.717
[sinister music]

28:42.651 --> 28:43.480
- So who's this guy
that's after you?

28:45.171 --> 28:47.311
- I don't know his name

28:47.346 --> 28:49.037
or what he looks like
or where he lives.

28:52.178 --> 28:53.145
- So, what, he's
threatened you then?

28:54.802 --> 28:56.182
- Not exactly.

28:57.321 --> 28:58.875
I think he's been
away for a few years.

28:58.909 --> 29:00.221
Locked up, maybe.

29:00.255 --> 29:01.394
Prison, an asylum.

29:03.707 --> 29:04.743
Anyway, it doesn't really
matter because he's back.

29:07.607 --> 29:08.919
- You said there's
other victims.

29:08.954 --> 29:11.094
- Yeah.

29:11.128 --> 29:11.888
I don't know
anything about them.

29:11.922 --> 29:14.131
- Jesus Christ,

29:14.166 --> 29:15.443
your a vague as
hell about this guy

29:15.477 --> 29:16.444
but you seem to know
everything about me.

29:18.377 --> 29:20.241
What's this psychic bullshit?

29:22.139 --> 29:22.968
- I think it's better
if I show you.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.564
- Nice.

29:33.599 --> 29:35.359
Very artistic.

29:35.394 --> 29:36.947
You'll win the tunnel
prize with this, mate.

29:36.982 --> 29:38.846
[chuckling]

29:38.880 --> 29:41.158
- All right, look, you're
walking down a street,

29:41.193 --> 29:42.850
say the High Street in town.

29:42.884 --> 29:43.989
- Yeah, that wouldn't happen,

29:44.023 --> 29:46.612
there's no pubs on
the High Street.

29:46.646 --> 29:47.716
- Fine, you're on
Constitution Street then.

29:47.751 --> 29:49.166
- Better.

29:50.029 --> 29:51.168
- Close your eyes.

29:51.203 --> 29:52.204
[chuckling]

29:52.238 --> 29:54.033
Please, just do it.

29:54.068 --> 29:55.759
You can be outside
your favorite pub.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.624
[whooshing]

30:00.315 --> 30:02.214
Now, do you notice everything?

30:03.422 --> 30:06.425
A person here, a car
there, flower pots.

30:06.459 --> 30:08.254
Gas canisters outside
an old church.

30:08.289 --> 30:10.394
- No, of course not.

30:10.429 --> 30:12.465
- No but you notice a small
child run across the road

30:12.500 --> 30:14.260
that nearly gets knocked down

30:15.330 --> 30:16.400
but you don't know this
old lady behind you

30:16.435 --> 30:17.194
is getting her purse stolen.

30:20.059 --> 30:21.854
That's what it's like for me.

30:21.889 --> 30:25.099
I see the street but not
everything that's happening.

30:25.133 --> 30:26.894
I get glimpse of the
future and the past,

30:26.928 --> 30:28.309
and sometimes the present,

30:28.343 --> 30:30.621
but it's all random,
jumbled detail

30:30.656 --> 30:32.071
all unconnected events.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.387
And I have to look for clues.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.631
Dates and times and I have
to piece it all together.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.979
- And you think he's gonna
kill all these other people.

30:43.013 --> 30:43.980
- I know he is.

30:44.014 --> 30:45.982
[scoffing]

30:48.398 --> 30:50.055
And he's also going to kill me.

30:54.335 --> 30:56.613
- So, why don't you just
hide, stay in bed that day?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.824
- I've seen my own death but
I have to try and prevent him

31:00.859 --> 31:02.377
from hurting anyone else.

31:03.033 --> 31:04.586
- I'll be honest, mate.

31:04.621 --> 31:06.416
You've got nothing here.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.383
No specific intel, no places,

31:08.418 --> 31:10.558
you don't know the
killer's name.

31:10.592 --> 31:12.663
It's a wild goose chase,
it's a waste of time.

31:12.698 --> 31:14.458
- I know he's coming for me.

31:14.493 --> 31:16.046
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna
need a little bit more

31:16.081 --> 31:17.151
than you tingling "spider
sense" to go on.

31:19.808 --> 31:21.327
You seem like a decent guy
but this is just crazy, mate.

31:23.191 --> 31:26.885
- Fine, just be my bodyguard.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.541
Stick around until he strikes.

31:32.028 --> 31:34.547
- Okay.

31:34.582 --> 31:36.411
But if I'm staying, you
better have some beers then.

31:38.966 --> 31:40.139
- All right, great.

31:40.174 --> 31:41.589
I'll go and get some.

our secure line.

32:03.335 --> 32:04.301
And they did it with your phone,

32:05.993 --> 32:08.340
leaving no prints, of course.

32:08.374 --> 32:11.308
- [Chatham] Sir, I have
no idea how this happened.

32:11.343 --> 32:12.447
- Well, apparently,
we're about to find out.

32:14.691 --> 32:16.003
What have you got?

32:17.073 --> 32:17.970
- This was recorded
in the city center.

32:22.871 --> 32:24.390
- Jesus.

32:30.879 --> 32:32.260
- What's this nonsense?

32:32.295 --> 32:33.848
- The share index crashed today.

32:33.882 --> 32:35.160
They closed at 5-8-9-5.

32:37.921 --> 32:39.233
- When was this recorded?

32:39.267 --> 32:40.820
- [Woman] Yesterday,
sir, Monday.

32:40.855 --> 32:42.236
- Good God.

I know why he's killing them.

33:37.636 --> 33:38.430
He's targeting psychics.

35:50.493 --> 35:51.632
That's a new one.

you bring what I asked?

- [Simon] Think
what could happen

36:55.316 --> 36:57.284
if someone who could
predict the stock market

36:57.318 --> 36:58.975
shared that information with
interested dark parties.

37:00.839 --> 37:02.254
I'm sure that's worth
immunity for just one man.

37:04.429 --> 37:06.879
Your own freelance assassins
get carte blanche all the time.

37:06.914 --> 37:09.261
- Oh, fuck you, you little shit.

37:09.296 --> 37:10.538
- Ah, nice to speak
with you, Mr. Johns.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.266
[phone beeping]

37:18.615 --> 37:19.547
They'll come around.

37:22.964 --> 37:24.449
- So,

37:26.865 --> 37:28.280
what now?

37:29.902 --> 37:32.111
- Finish securing the database.

37:32.146 --> 37:33.043
Tomorrow I have to take a test.

37:36.564 --> 37:38.117
- What test?

37:39.878 --> 37:42.639
Simon, what test?

37:42.674 --> 37:45.849
[coals rustling]

37:45.884 --> 37:47.989
[eerie music]

37:52.131 --> 37:56.757
[sizzling]
[man screaming]

37:56.791 --> 37:59.138
[sinister music]

38:05.041 --> 38:07.492
[somber tempo music]

38:17.191 --> 38:19.331
- You realize my foundation
has been testing claims

38:19.366 --> 38:21.920
of paranormal and
parapsychological powers

38:21.954 --> 38:23.508
for many years now and

38:25.579 --> 38:28.823
no one has ever passed
our stringent procedures.

38:28.858 --> 38:30.480
No one.

38:30.515 --> 38:31.585
- I'm aware.

38:31.619 --> 38:33.172
- Good.

38:39.938 --> 38:41.422
Right.

38:42.389 --> 38:45.253
Present today are
Jerald Gifford,

38:45.288 --> 38:47.842
who handles all the technical
and logistical issues

38:47.877 --> 38:49.568
here at the lab,

38:49.603 --> 38:51.984
and Miss Scire, who
is out legal advisor.

38:53.296 --> 38:54.193
Take a seat, Simon.

38:58.922 --> 39:00.959
- So,

39:00.993 --> 39:02.167
all the paperwork is in order.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.897
Simon, Mr. Eildon, is away
that if he completes the task,

39:07.931 --> 39:10.451
which in the unanimous
opinion of all of us present,

39:10.486 --> 39:13.351
demonstrates undeniable
proof of PSI powers,

39:13.385 --> 39:14.213
he will be awarded the prize.

39:16.630 --> 39:20.737
As the numeric value of the
Greek letter PSI is 700,

39:20.772 --> 39:24.051
the prize has been sent at the
sum of 700 thousand pounds.

39:24.085 --> 39:26.018
- The satisfactory
completion of the task

39:26.053 --> 39:28.331
will make the first
time in history

39:28.366 --> 39:30.368
that such a feat has been
scientifically ratified.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.163
- This is your
chance to back out.

39:35.407 --> 39:36.857
We publish the names
of all of those

39:36.891 --> 39:37.996
who try and fail the test

39:39.653 --> 39:40.481
and the internet never forgets.

39:42.518 --> 39:44.002
- I'm ready.

39:44.036 --> 39:45.590
- Mr. Brennus,

39:45.624 --> 39:47.074
the protocols require
that the subject

39:47.108 --> 39:48.109
performs the task while alone.

39:50.215 --> 39:52.044
Would you be so kind
as to go next door?

39:52.079 --> 39:52.907
You can view it from there.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.531
- Works with me.

39:56.566 --> 39:59.051
[somber tempo music]

40:01.157 --> 40:02.089
- Many people believe

40:04.609 --> 40:07.577
metal bending or spoon
bending is possible,

40:07.612 --> 40:09.683
even commonplace

40:09.717 --> 40:12.237
but every scientific
assessment disproves the claim.

40:15.274 --> 40:17.898
This is the foolproof
test we have for that.

40:19.762 --> 40:21.660
A metal bar

40:21.695 --> 40:23.455
inside a sealed glass tube.

40:25.940 --> 40:27.942
The test subject must bend the
metal bar without touching it

40:29.565 --> 40:30.566
using only the
power of the mind.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.467
At present, the rode is
as straight as a die.

40:37.814 --> 40:40.196
If at the end of 15 minutes,
the rod remains unchanged,

40:40.230 --> 40:41.024
then the challenge will fail.

40:42.716 --> 40:44.269
Are you ready, son?

40:45.753 --> 40:47.272
- Yes.

40:49.619 --> 40:51.000
- Let's begin.

40:52.726 --> 40:54.831
[beeping]

40:54.866 --> 40:56.971
[eerie music]

41:29.107 --> 41:31.109
[whooshing]

41:38.047 --> 41:40.187
- Oh my God, can you see that?

41:40.221 --> 41:41.326
- Are you recording this?

41:41.360 --> 41:43.466
- [Gifford] I'm getting,
I'm getting it!

41:43.501 --> 41:44.536
- [Scire] I'd never
have believed it

41:44.571 --> 41:46.296
if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes.

41:46.331 --> 41:48.298
- We wouldn't see
history be made here.

41:48.333 --> 41:50.266
This is the first time
ever that the metal bar

41:50.300 --> 41:51.439
has been bent my
mental power alone.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.584
Congratulations.

41:57.618 --> 41:59.033
What an incredible moment!

42:01.588 --> 42:03.037
- How did you do it?

42:03.900 --> 42:05.730
We have got to share this.

42:05.764 --> 42:09.216
- Mr. Gifford, please, the
rules are perfectly clear

42:09.250 --> 42:11.839
and the contract's
binding on both sides.

42:11.874 --> 42:14.255
Miss Scire, would you please
remove the test equipment,

42:14.290 --> 42:15.843
including the memory
card in the camera,

42:15.878 --> 42:18.397
and secure it in my safe?

42:18.432 --> 42:21.504
Simon, I have pend
many a good year

42:21.539 --> 42:24.196
inviting people to try
and prove the existence

42:24.231 --> 42:25.197
of paranormal phenomenon.

42:27.199 --> 42:27.959
I never believed they would.

42:29.892 --> 42:32.204
It's my deepest privilege

42:32.239 --> 42:35.483
that you came here
to prove me wrong.

42:35.967 --> 42:37.347
- You're welcome.

42:40.454 --> 42:43.319
- He's a threat to
national security.

42:43.353 --> 42:47.012
- There's no obvious crime
we can charge him with.

42:47.047 --> 42:49.394
We have no authority
to detain him.

42:49.428 --> 42:51.154
- He dialed into a
classified phone line.

42:51.189 --> 42:53.018
That is an offense.

42:53.053 --> 42:55.158
- Records will show
it was my phone.

42:55.193 --> 42:58.472
- And we have him on
CCTV stealing that phone.

42:59.438 --> 43:00.957
- True.

43:02.925 --> 43:04.582
- Do we at least know who he is?

43:06.687 --> 43:09.448
- Facial recognition hasn't
turned up anything yet.

43:09.483 --> 43:12.279
Voice analysis says that
Simon is Scottish and local.

43:12.313 --> 43:14.419
- And the only Steven Brennus
we know of is this guy.

43:14.453 --> 43:15.903
Excess AS.

43:17.422 --> 43:18.526
- [Johns] Hired
muscle, you think?

43:18.561 --> 43:20.045
- Aye.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.322
- Have we checked him out?

43:21.357 --> 43:22.979
- Special branch
just had a gander.

43:23.014 --> 43:24.843
There's no one at his house.

43:24.878 --> 43:26.880
You got some bodies on the
ground looking for his car.

43:26.914 --> 43:28.398
[phone ringing]
Stokes?

43:29.745 --> 43:31.160
Sorry, who?

43:32.023 --> 43:33.645
I'm sure that's very exciting

43:33.680 --> 43:35.164
but it's not exactly our
highest priority right now.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.134
What?

43:40.169 --> 43:42.654
Say that second name again.

43:42.689 --> 43:44.069
- Brennus, Steve Brennus,

43:46.002 --> 43:46.969
a bodyguard or something.

43:48.936 --> 43:50.041
Who cares about him?

43:52.630 --> 43:54.632
It's what this young Simon
guy did that's so amazing.

43:56.461 --> 43:57.945
He can move things
with his mind.

43:59.395 --> 44:01.500
- Can you describe this Simon?

44:03.192 --> 44:04.952
- Since when do we
keep tabs on psychics?

44:09.750 --> 44:12.822
- Our colonial cousins have
wasted millions of dollars

44:12.857 --> 44:14.099
to try to track
potential psychics.

44:16.550 --> 44:19.898
We prefer to simply monitor
a few reliable institutions

44:19.933 --> 44:21.624
who unwittingly do
the vetting for us.

44:25.386 --> 44:26.525
The odd informant
here and there.

44:28.286 --> 44:30.633
Much more cost effective.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.221
- Okay.

44:32.255 --> 44:33.015
Have you got their details?

44:39.435 --> 44:40.470
- [Steve] Right, what the
hell was that all about?

44:42.680 --> 44:47.443
- Okay, so truth is I
can't do telekinesis.

44:47.477 --> 44:50.032
Believe me, I have tried
to move things with my mind

44:50.066 --> 44:53.173
but I'm just not strong enough.

44:53.207 --> 44:55.934
It's like trying to lift a
weight with my little finger.

44:55.969 --> 44:57.315
- Well the buffoons in there

44:57.349 --> 44:59.213
were still wetting their
pants though, weren't they?

44:59.248 --> 45:00.663
- Yeah, well, putting
thoughts in people's minds

45:00.698 --> 45:02.216
is a tad easier.

45:04.218 --> 45:06.669
Look, I just made them
believe the metal was bending.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.568
Whether it's confusing people
or seeing into the future,

45:09.603 --> 45:11.156
it works better if I have
a personal connection.

45:11.191 --> 45:12.710
- [Steve] Like with the killer?

45:12.744 --> 45:14.539
- And doing the test.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.300
Look, if I die,

45:17.335 --> 45:18.301
the world should know I existed.

45:20.787 --> 45:22.409
I have another reason as well.

45:23.997 --> 45:25.308
It'll also persuade
certain people

45:25.343 --> 45:27.207
that we should be
taken seriously.

45:31.073 --> 45:33.592
- You gonna tell me who?

45:33.627 --> 45:35.146
- Nope.

45:35.802 --> 45:37.320
- Fine.

45:37.976 --> 45:39.564
Don't wanna know anyway.

45:42.153 --> 45:44.534
[foreboding music]

46:21.088 --> 46:23.021
All right, who the hell's this?

46:30.891 --> 46:34.032
- Mr. Simon Eildon, Mr. Steven
Brennus, you're under arrest.

46:34.067 --> 46:35.240
- On what charge?

46:35.275 --> 46:36.103
- Endangering nation security.

46:37.656 --> 46:39.141
- And nicking my phone.

46:44.663 --> 46:46.907
[ominous music]

46:54.673 --> 46:55.640
- I'm guessing you
didn't foresee this.

46:57.849 --> 46:58.919
- Not an exact
science, remember.

47:03.337 --> 47:04.235
- And who do love
when you're at home?

47:06.893 --> 47:07.617
- The people who
run the country.

47:09.171 --> 47:10.586
Not the politicians.

47:10.620 --> 47:12.312
The people who are
really in charge.

47:14.107 --> 47:15.625
- And what about these?

47:16.730 --> 47:17.904
- Can't you make them
magically disappear?

47:22.460 --> 47:23.564
- We'll allow it.

47:30.157 --> 47:32.090
- No matter what
they do with you,

47:32.125 --> 47:33.885
I'm gonna make sure the
hold you end up in

47:33.920 --> 47:35.300
will be as uncomfortable
as possible.

47:39.615 --> 47:40.340
- Quite a history you have here.

47:42.721 --> 47:44.102
Fascinating.

47:46.415 --> 47:47.865
- The immunity?

47:48.935 --> 47:50.868
- Oh, for God sake,
give it to him

47:50.902 --> 47:52.317
so we can get started.

47:55.079 --> 47:57.253
[somber music]

48:02.638 --> 48:05.192
[chuckling]

48:05.227 --> 48:08.333
- Have you seen
who's signed this?

48:08.368 --> 48:09.887
So,

48:10.680 --> 48:14.719
I could kill anyone in
this room right now

48:14.753 --> 48:15.444
and you couldn't press charges.

48:18.585 --> 48:20.035
- Highly amusing.

48:21.450 --> 48:22.969
So,

48:23.452 --> 48:25.109
just for the record,

48:25.143 --> 48:26.420
former corporal
Brennus of the SAS,

48:28.629 --> 48:30.252
what precisely is your
involvement in this?

48:31.978 --> 48:33.427
- I'm the lad's driver

48:33.945 --> 48:35.360
and I like this job.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.915
[laughing]

48:37.949 --> 48:39.330
- Very good.

48:41.988 --> 48:43.575
Mr. Simon Eildon.

48:44.783 --> 48:47.821
According to this file, you
claim to have a telepathic link.

48:47.855 --> 48:49.581
- It's not telepathy.

48:49.616 --> 48:51.894
I can't read minds.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.138
It's more of a limited
clairvoyance.

48:56.416 --> 48:59.591
- A link with a
supposed serial killer

48:59.626 --> 49:02.077
whose alleged crimes
are unsubstantiated.

49:03.699 --> 49:05.218
Please, explain.

49:07.565 --> 49:09.774
- I believe that my
fear of him prevents me

49:09.808 --> 49:11.845
from making a useful connection.

49:11.879 --> 49:13.951
We've met once.

49:13.985 --> 49:16.505
- Ah, yes, according to you,

49:16.539 --> 49:18.679
this was the man
responsible for the murder

49:18.714 --> 49:21.993
that you witnessed when
you were eight years old.

49:22.028 --> 49:25.272
Victim's name was a Catholic
priest, Father Cavanagh.

49:27.516 --> 49:29.552
[ghostly whispering]

49:29.587 --> 49:31.796
- [Hooded Man] Father!

49:31.830 --> 49:32.624
I was born of sin.

49:34.212 --> 49:35.938
A man of the cloth.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.664
Ye,

49:37.698 --> 49:38.527
my real father,

49:40.391 --> 49:41.909
conceived in Hell
by the good man.

49:45.051 --> 49:48.744
Here is your punishment
for your grave sin!

49:48.778 --> 49:50.988
[dramatic music]

49:51.022 --> 49:54.232
- Listen, boy, pay attention!

49:54.267 --> 49:56.545
You're just one step
away from a private cell

49:56.579 --> 49:58.064
with very few
opportunities for parole.

50:01.412 --> 50:03.483
[ominous music]

50:21.190 --> 50:22.916
- You're the guy, right?

50:22.950 --> 50:24.469
The one on the chat forum?

50:29.992 --> 50:31.580
- Did you bring it?

50:31.614 --> 50:33.375
- Who are you anyway?

50:33.409 --> 50:35.618
What do you want
with this stuff?

50:39.001 --> 50:40.175
- Science is a
competitive business.

50:42.660 --> 50:44.213
Universities.

50:44.248 --> 50:46.043
Private academic institutions.

50:49.322 --> 50:50.426
They need to know what
their rivals are up to.

50:52.118 --> 50:53.947
When it comes to a potentially

50:53.981 --> 50:56.018
explosive discovery like this,

50:57.744 --> 50:59.228
well, it has value.

51:04.268 --> 51:05.269
- So did you bring
what I asked for?

51:09.307 --> 51:11.206
[eerie music]

51:13.000 --> 51:15.002
[chuckling]

51:16.521 --> 51:18.109
Oh, baby.

51:18.144 --> 51:20.284
[clearing throat]

51:20.318 --> 51:21.871
Oh yeah.

51:22.424 --> 51:23.942
Sorry.

51:25.116 --> 51:26.359
This is all I could get.

51:26.393 --> 51:27.360
This guy, Simon.

51:29.638 --> 51:30.501
Personal details.

51:30.535 --> 51:31.916
- His address.

51:32.572 --> 51:33.987
- Of course.

51:35.885 --> 51:38.819
- We can have you rot in prison.

51:38.854 --> 51:41.719
- Detention isn't the answer.

51:41.753 --> 51:44.860
You obviously want to understand
and improve your abilities.

51:44.894 --> 51:48.035
A top of the rang scientific
establishment is what you need.

51:48.070 --> 51:50.279
- I have what I need.

51:50.314 --> 51:52.868
- But think of the
resources we could provide.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.525
Experts in neural science,

51:54.559 --> 51:55.802
physiology,

51:55.836 --> 51:57.355
subatomic physics.

51:57.390 --> 51:59.599
- Not interested.

51:59.633 --> 52:01.532
- What do you want, money?

52:01.566 --> 52:02.843
- I've got money.

52:02.878 --> 52:05.087
- We can give you more.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.537
- I have enough to
getting on with.

52:06.571 --> 52:08.918
- Then what do you want?

52:08.953 --> 52:10.161
- I want to get out of here.

52:12.301 --> 52:13.682
- I don't think that's
gonna happen very soon.

52:13.716 --> 52:14.890
In fact--

52:14.924 --> 52:15.787
- [Steve] Jesus, Simon!

52:15.822 --> 52:16.478
- [Chatham] Jesus Christ!

52:16.512 --> 52:18.238
- Simon!

52:18.273 --> 52:20.999
[dramatic music]

52:21.034 --> 52:22.000
- [Chatham] Jesus.

52:22.035 --> 52:23.968
[gagging]

52:29.663 --> 52:30.492
- I'll get help.

52:30.526 --> 52:31.941
- No you won't.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.152
He doesn't need any help.

52:35.186 --> 52:37.015
Just give him a few seconds.

52:37.050 --> 52:40.778
[dramatic music]

52:40.812 --> 52:42.849
- He's dying, for Christ sake!

52:42.883 --> 52:45.162
- [Steve] Just give
him a few seconds!

52:45.196 --> 52:47.957
You might actually learn
something about who this lad is.

52:47.992 --> 52:48.855
- [Chatham] He's got no pulse.

52:48.889 --> 52:49.890
- Just

52:49.925 --> 52:50.822
wait.

52:50.857 --> 52:53.618
[gasping]

52:53.653 --> 52:56.000
[dramatic music]

53:02.800 --> 53:04.491
[gasping]

53:19.023 --> 53:20.990
[thudding]

53:21.025 --> 53:22.406
- [Johns] Mr. Stokes!

53:22.440 --> 53:24.201
[groaning]

53:32.381 --> 53:34.349
[somber music]

53:52.470 --> 53:54.161
- No hidden pockets,

53:54.196 --> 53:56.094
no cutting edges, no
devices, nothing.

53:59.926 --> 54:01.686
- There must be something.

54:01.721 --> 54:03.170
It's a trick.

54:03.205 --> 54:04.689
- That one seemed different.

54:04.724 --> 54:05.552
- It was.

54:05.587 --> 54:06.864
Quick.

54:06.898 --> 54:08.797
Very unusual.

54:08.831 --> 54:09.556
- He didn't torture
or hurt them?

54:09.591 --> 54:11.696
- No.

54:11.731 --> 54:13.353
It's like he wanted something
so he just killed to get it.

54:15.390 --> 54:17.495
He's killing more often
and more frequently.

54:17.530 --> 54:19.117
We need to stop him.

54:19.152 --> 54:20.291
- Which means getting
out of here.

54:20.326 --> 54:21.361
- [Woman On Screen] So
what did we just witness?

54:21.396 --> 54:23.294
- Somewhere.

54:23.329 --> 54:25.227
- Is there any chance of
getting your attention?

54:25.262 --> 54:27.540
A small matter of
nation security.

54:27.574 --> 54:28.713
- What's the time?

54:28.748 --> 54:30.370
- What?

54:30.405 --> 54:31.509
- The time.

54:31.544 --> 54:34.063
- 4:17, why?

54:34.098 --> 54:37.481
- Because if it's 4:17,
then 15 minutes ago

54:37.515 --> 54:40.346
the USS Carolina, a
Virginia class submarine

54:40.380 --> 54:42.693
currently docked at
the Faslane Naval Base,

54:42.727 --> 54:44.246
less than 80 miles from here

54:44.281 --> 54:46.006
developed a fault in the wiring

54:46.041 --> 54:47.836
associated with a
nuclear reactor.

54:47.870 --> 54:48.871
- Now look here!
- Be quiet!

54:50.804 --> 54:53.704
- The problem is valve 11-27-30.

54:53.738 --> 54:55.153
For some reason it's opened
when it should be closed.

54:57.673 --> 54:59.296
- [Radio Man] Wait for status.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.816
- Simon?

55:03.023 --> 55:05.302
[ominous music]

55:07.787 --> 55:08.477
- Did you open that valve?

55:11.377 --> 55:13.068
- The same valve has
a universal fitting

55:13.102 --> 55:15.829
on other US Nuclear Navy subs.

55:15.864 --> 55:18.522
Not to mention the
entire UK Trident fleet

55:18.556 --> 55:20.869
currently on an exercise
just off the coast of Norway.

55:20.903 --> 55:22.388
- That's classified.

55:22.422 --> 55:23.837
- But true.

55:25.529 --> 55:27.600
- A faulty valve in a
dry dock submarine

55:27.634 --> 55:29.809
is obviously a problem

55:29.843 --> 55:31.328
but it can be remedied.

55:32.570 --> 55:36.091
The same faulty valve in
a sub at sea, however,

55:36.125 --> 55:37.782
that's a disaster.

55:39.094 --> 55:40.371
It would be a terrible
thing if someone were

55:40.406 --> 55:42.684
to open the valve
at the wrong time.

55:42.718 --> 55:44.306
- What is it that you want?

55:45.065 --> 55:47.482
- Guarantee Steven's immunity

55:47.516 --> 55:49.622
that you're not just going
to rip it up when we leave.

55:49.656 --> 55:51.796
Promise not try to detain us

55:51.831 --> 55:54.420
and just let us go.

55:54.454 --> 55:56.007
- That's it?

55:57.733 --> 55:59.183
- Once we're out of your
hair, the subs will be safe,

56:00.667 --> 56:02.324
including the Carolina.

56:13.887 --> 56:15.475
- Do me a favor.

56:15.510 --> 56:17.477
- What's that?

56:17.512 --> 56:21.239
- If I'm ever tempted to play
poker with you, shoot me.

56:21.274 --> 56:24.242
You're the chanciest, ballsy
bloke that I ever met.

56:30.387 --> 56:31.940
Oh, they're good.

56:31.974 --> 56:33.320
- [Simon] What do you mean?

56:34.460 --> 56:35.495
- Well, you wouldn't know
they searched the place.

56:39.016 --> 56:40.845
Look, how are you doing?

56:40.880 --> 56:42.226
- Yeah, fine.

56:43.572 --> 56:44.987
I'm just a bit tired.

56:45.678 --> 56:47.714
- Yeah.

56:47.749 --> 56:48.991
I'll go and order some pizza.

56:49.026 --> 56:50.234
Do you want a cup of tea?

56:50.268 --> 56:51.787
- Yeah.

56:54.721 --> 56:56.896
[somber music]

56:58.173 --> 56:59.485
Father.

57:05.905 --> 57:08.252
[dramatic music]

57:35.106 --> 57:36.453
- He's at rest now.

57:39.283 --> 57:39.973
- I should've stopped it.

57:44.668 --> 57:45.807
- You can't fix
everything, Simon.

57:48.154 --> 57:49.189
And sometimes bad thing happen.

57:54.643 --> 57:57.370
I don't think the world
is ready for you yet.

57:59.821 --> 58:00.822
It may never be.

58:17.563 --> 58:19.806
[phone ringing]

58:25.225 --> 58:27.400
- Hello?
- Simon?

58:28.401 --> 58:30.403
Professor Richet, here.

58:30.437 --> 58:33.544
I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you.

58:33.579 --> 58:34.890
As you know, we were
going to announce

58:34.925 --> 58:37.410
your success in the morning.

58:37.444 --> 58:38.860
I'm afraid we're going
to have to postpone.

58:41.483 --> 58:42.795
Our colleague, Mr.
Gifford, has gone missing.

58:45.556 --> 58:47.109
We fear something may
have happened to him.

58:51.493 --> 58:53.806
[dramatic music]

59:03.712 --> 59:05.127
- What's up?

59:06.750 --> 59:08.165
- It's over.

59:13.688 --> 59:16.173
[demonic whispering]

59:23.076 --> 59:25.078
- Let us silence the blasphemer.

59:26.632 --> 59:28.875
[ominous music]

59:34.363 --> 59:36.883
- Simon, you can't just
fire me like that.

59:36.918 --> 59:39.368
- I can and I am.

59:39.403 --> 59:40.991
- Like hell you are.

59:41.025 --> 59:41.888
- Look, if it's about the money,

59:41.923 --> 59:43.372
I'll pay you the full amount.

59:43.407 --> 59:44.581
- All right, Simon,

59:44.615 --> 59:46.824
what's this craziness
that's in your head now?

59:46.859 --> 59:48.308
- I started all of this

59:48.343 --> 59:50.276
but I didn't think
through the consequence,

59:50.310 --> 59:51.691
I didn't foresee
what could happen.

59:51.726 --> 59:53.210
- So what?

59:53.244 --> 59:54.591
Welcome to what it's
like for the rest of us.

59:54.625 --> 59:55.971
- You don't understand.

59:56.006 --> 59:58.042
Someone else has died.

59:58.077 --> 59:59.423
One of the scientists.

59:59.457 --> 01:00:01.114
The killer murdered
him because of me

01:00:01.149 --> 01:00:03.461
because of what I
did, I'm responsible.

01:00:03.496 --> 01:00:04.704
- You're the one responsible
for being an asshole.

01:00:04.739 --> 01:00:06.913
You didn't kill him.

01:00:06.948 --> 01:00:08.984
- You need to look after
Christine and Sally.

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:11.159
- And what are you
gonna do, huh?

01:00:11.193 --> 01:00:13.195
Muscle up to a
killer on your own?

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:15.197
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do, all right?

01:00:15.232 --> 01:00:16.923
- Because I would show my
hairy ass and jog a short wind

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:18.131
if I thought you
could even fight

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:19.823
your way out of a
paper fucking bag.

01:00:19.857 --> 01:00:21.203
- Oh, spare me the
tough guy act.

01:00:21.238 --> 01:00:22.549
- Oh fuck off, that's
why you hired me!

01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:23.620
You're a weakling.

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.138
- I have powers!

01:00:25.173 --> 01:00:26.484
- Yeah, and what have
you done with them?

01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:28.107
You know, you could
rule the world

01:00:28.141 --> 01:00:30.143
but you're just a
fucking whinger!

01:00:30.178 --> 01:00:31.075
- [Simon] At least I'm
not a washed-up has been!

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.043
- No, you're "never was."

01:00:33.077 --> 01:00:34.596
You've been hiding behind
your mom's skirts for years!

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.253
- And you're a child batterer!

01:00:40.498 --> 01:00:42.293
[chuckling]

01:00:45.227 --> 01:00:47.229
- Think I'll go
make some more tea.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:53.580
[gasping]

01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:57.688
[screaming]
[rumbling]

01:00:57.723 --> 01:00:59.794
[eerie music]

01:01:20.228 --> 01:01:22.299
[phone ringing]

01:01:25.095 --> 01:01:26.855
- Daddy!
- Steve, hi.

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.271
- Hey.

01:01:29.306 --> 01:01:30.721
- I thought you'd be a bit
more pleased to see us.

01:01:30.756 --> 01:01:32.412
- Sorry.

01:01:32.447 --> 01:01:34.863
[chuckling]

01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:36.900
- She wants to know why

01:01:36.934 --> 01:01:38.315
you're wearing a
plaster on your head.

01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:39.834
- Oh.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.665
- Did someone hurt you, Daddy?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.909
- Yeah, they did.

01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:47.945
- Was that because
you were naughty?

01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:53.123
- She thinks that you hit
her because she was naughty.

01:01:56.574 --> 01:01:57.817
- You shouldn't sneak about

01:01:57.852 --> 01:01:59.439
and listen to other
people talking.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.029
- You did nothing
wrong, sweetheart.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:05.549
You weren't naughty.

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.793
It was Daddy who was naughty

01:02:07.827 --> 01:02:09.311
for losing his temper and
hitting the door, wasn't it?

01:02:12.004 --> 01:02:14.800
I'm so sorry I hurt you,
sweetheart, I'm so very sorry.

01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:17.768
- It's okay, it
doesn't hurt anymore.

01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:20.426
- Listen, darling, why don't
you go off and play just now?

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.428
Okay?

01:02:22.462 --> 01:02:24.395
Mommy and Daddy need to talk
about some grownup stuff.

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.052
- See you soon.

01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:29.262
[dramatic music]

01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:32.093
Is she really okay?

01:02:33.508 --> 01:02:35.027
- Yeah.

01:02:35.648 --> 01:02:37.374
- I miss you.

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:39.721
- [Christine] I miss you too.

01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:42.068
- Are we okay?

01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:44.726
- That depends.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.555
What's going on, Steve, are
you mixed up in something bad?

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.798
- No.

01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:49.386
Why?

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.113
- Well, today Mom's
local highland policeman

01:02:52.147 --> 01:02:55.426
drove 35 miles of winding
back road to come here

01:02:55.461 --> 01:02:57.428
and ask whether you'd
ever been involved in any

01:02:57.463 --> 01:03:00.086
major criminal
activities or terrorism.

01:03:00.121 --> 01:03:02.123
- What did she say?

01:03:02.157 --> 01:03:03.987
- Mom made him a cup of tea

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:04.919
and they both talked
about the problems

01:03:04.953 --> 01:03:06.368
they had with potato bugs.

01:03:06.403 --> 01:03:07.956
I don't think it was any
bother to you, to be honest,

01:03:07.991 --> 01:03:09.406
but there is something else.

01:03:11.408 --> 01:03:14.445
Two minutes ago I get
a text from the bank.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.240
Steve, why have we suddenly
acquired 700 thousand pounds?

01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:17.621
- 700?

01:03:17.655 --> 01:03:20.210
[ominous tempo music]

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:22.350
Babes, I need to go,
can I call you later?

01:03:22.384 --> 01:03:23.800
I love you.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.216
Simon!

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:26.906
What the?

01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:28.770
[whooshing]

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:29.771
[groaning]

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.324
- Shit.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.534
[thudding]

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:37.365
Whoops.

01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:46.892
Sorry, Steve.

01:03:47.754 --> 01:03:49.446
I have to do this on my own.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.828
[doorbell ringing]

01:03:54.658 --> 01:03:56.660
[doorbell ringing]

01:03:56.694 --> 01:03:58.455
Who is it?

01:03:58.489 --> 01:04:00.802
- [Man] Pizza delivery.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.287
- Could you just
leave it outside?

01:04:03.322 --> 01:04:04.910
- [Man] Sorry, I
still need the cash.

01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:05.807
- All right, just a minute.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.369
- [Man] You still there?

01:04:18.682 --> 01:04:20.995
[sinister music]

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:24.515
[groaning]

01:04:33.766 --> 01:04:35.388
- Mr. Brennus?

01:04:40.393 --> 01:04:42.119
- What's going on?

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:42.844
- Simon's been taken.

01:04:46.434 --> 01:04:48.505
[ominous music]

01:05:20.744 --> 01:05:22.919
We think he was grabbed by the
killer you were going after.

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:24.196
Did you see anything?

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:26.198
- No.

01:05:26.232 --> 01:05:27.268
No, I was out cold
before anything happened.

01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:31.928
Simon knocked me out.

01:05:33.446 --> 01:05:34.931
Yeah.

01:05:36.518 --> 01:05:37.485
- So that's what all
that noise was about.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.523
We bugged the place.

01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:44.043
- Of course you did.

01:05:44.078 --> 01:05:44.941
- We managed to get
a particle plate.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:45.769
Checking now.

01:05:45.803 --> 01:05:46.770
- Simon's phone?

01:05:46.804 --> 01:05:48.151
- [Stokes] Tracking it.

01:05:49.497 --> 01:05:52.465
[ominous music]

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.260
[rumbling]

01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:19.009
[eerie music]

01:06:23.117 --> 01:06:26.983
[thudding]
[groaning]

01:06:34.956 --> 01:06:36.440
- All these glimpses
of the future

01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:39.202
but he couldn't see what
shit was coming down on him.

01:06:39.236 --> 01:06:41.998
- He knew exactly
what was coming,

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:42.964
it's just that some
people didn't listen.

01:06:47.313 --> 01:06:49.005
- Joseph Cavanagh.

01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:50.868
My uncle.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.357
- He was the priest that
married Christine in me.

01:07:00.568 --> 01:07:02.363
- Did you go to the funeral?

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:03.916
- Yeah, of course.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.540
- Do you remember a young
boy stood at the back?

01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:10.405
Very quiet, crying a lot.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.993
- Yeah.

01:07:12.683 --> 01:07:14.444
- I didn't know who he was.

01:07:14.478 --> 01:07:16.273
He shook my hand.

01:07:16.308 --> 01:07:17.964
- Yeah, mine too.

01:07:17.999 --> 01:07:19.449
Jesus, Simon.

01:07:19.483 --> 01:07:21.554
- That's how he's
connected to you and me.

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:23.211
Why he's approached us.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:26.111
- This is new.

01:07:27.871 --> 01:07:29.321
"Father and son."

01:07:29.355 --> 01:07:30.598
The son of a priest!

01:07:30.632 --> 01:07:31.702
- Jesus Christ.

01:07:31.737 --> 01:07:32.738
- The son of a fucking...

01:07:32.772 --> 01:07:33.808
The killer's your cousin!

01:07:33.842 --> 01:07:34.947
The killer's your
fucking cousin!

01:07:34.981 --> 01:07:35.913
What's his name?

01:07:35.948 --> 01:07:37.398
You must know it!

01:07:37.432 --> 01:07:38.088
- No.

01:07:39.331 --> 01:07:40.470
My uncle must've kept
his existence a secret.

01:07:43.128 --> 01:07:45.475
There's nothing known in the
family about any of this.

01:07:45.509 --> 01:07:46.476
About any kind of a scandal.

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.029
- No luck on the mobile.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.203
Still searching for
the van's plates.

01:07:49.237 --> 01:07:51.067
- The van?

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:53.103
- Yeah, I caught just a
glimpse of it as it drove off.

01:07:53.138 --> 01:07:55.001
- We think CCTV picked him
up heading toward the city

01:07:55.036 --> 01:07:55.726
but we're still checking.

01:07:59.937 --> 01:08:02.319
[suspenseful music]

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:07.428
- Where the hell are you going?

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.119
- Your man said the van was
heading into town, right?

01:08:09.154 --> 01:08:10.086
Let me know when you
have a position.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.156
- You're not part
of this operation.

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:12.674
- Wrong.

01:08:12.709 --> 01:08:14.366
The boy hired me to protect him

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.712
and he grabbed him from
right underneath my nose.

01:08:15.746 --> 01:08:16.540
[van puttering]

01:08:16.575 --> 01:08:17.783
Come on!

01:08:17.817 --> 01:08:19.233
[engine stalling]

01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:20.716
Jesus Christ!

01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:23.478
- Who dares wins.

01:08:24.376 --> 01:08:27.310
[suspenseful music]

01:08:27.344 --> 01:08:29.415
[motor buzzing]

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.526
- There are three vans
that match that partial.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.906
One belongs to a rental agency.

01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:38.596
- It wasn't a rental.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:40.081
Too old.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.807
- Two options then.

01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:44.395
Did you see anything
else at all?

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.743
- Caught a flash of a sign
on the side of the van.

01:08:46.777 --> 01:08:48.399
Faded lettering..

01:08:49.504 --> 01:08:51.471
An image of something.

01:08:55.303 --> 01:08:57.374
[ominous music]

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:19.292
[van door thudding]

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:21.466
[foreboding music]

01:09:37.138 --> 01:09:38.587
- Trying the address one
if the vans is registered.

01:09:38.622 --> 01:09:40.210
No answer so far.

01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:43.317
- That paint work, it
was some kind of garage.

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:45.180
- One of the vans used to
belong to a kinda body shop

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:47.113
or metal works.

01:09:47.148 --> 01:09:49.495
- According to this it went
out of business years ago.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:51.220
The whole area's derelict.

01:09:51.256 --> 01:09:52.221
- All right, tell the
blokes to get down there.

01:09:52.256 --> 01:09:54.914
Sir, we know where
he's taking Simon.

01:09:54.949 --> 01:09:56.226
- That's of little
consequence right now.

01:09:56.261 --> 01:09:57.331
- [Chatham] Sir?

01:09:57.365 --> 01:09:59.988
- There will be
no close pursuit.

01:10:00.023 --> 01:10:01.369
- [Chatham] But, sir,
Simon's been taken.

01:10:01.404 --> 01:10:04.234
- The problem with the USS
Carolina has been resolved

01:10:04.269 --> 01:10:05.339
and the rest of our
subs are unaffected.

01:10:08.273 --> 01:10:09.308
We know we cannot tolerate
a similar incident.

01:10:12.173 --> 01:10:13.485
Orders are that Simon
Eildon is to be eliminated.

01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:16.419
- No!

01:10:16.453 --> 01:10:18.386
- It seems that this
fortuitous kidnapper

01:10:18.421 --> 01:10:19.939
will save us the trouble.

01:10:20.768 --> 01:10:22.356
- You've gotta be kidding.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.254
- And then we will
perform our public duty

01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:26.360
of arresting a
terrible serial killer

01:10:26.394 --> 01:10:27.706
as he stands over the
body of his latest victim.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.262
Such a great tragedy that
the forces of law and order

01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:33.159
where not able to
get there on time.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.266
But we did get our
man in the end.

01:10:38.682 --> 01:10:40.443
And those things do play
rather well with the press.

01:10:42.099 --> 01:10:44.481
[suspenseful music]

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.325
[ominous music]

01:11:12.544 --> 01:11:14.442
[eerie music]

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.803
- Amen.

01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:37.154
Behold the man.

01:11:38.846 --> 01:11:41.124
[motor buzzing]

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.475
[Simon groaning]

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.758
[ominous music]

01:12:17.574 --> 01:12:19.990
[muffled screaming]

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:03.620
[Simon moaning]

01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:05.277
Huh?

01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.416
[Simon moaning]

01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:07.969
What?

01:13:14.217 --> 01:13:15.391
- You don't remember me, do you?

01:13:18.635 --> 01:13:20.050
The church.

01:13:21.914 --> 01:13:22.708
When you killed your father.

01:13:27.472 --> 01:13:28.300
- Interfering boy.

01:13:30.475 --> 01:13:31.993
The witness.

01:13:38.897 --> 01:13:41.900
Both of us cast adrift
by the same tragedy

01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:46.422
brought together
again by providence.

01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:49.942
Such divine symmetry.

01:13:53.808 --> 01:13:56.984
[ominous music]

01:13:57.018 --> 01:13:59.435
[suspenseful music]

01:14:03.577 --> 01:14:05.302
- Mr. Brennus?

01:14:05.337 --> 01:14:06.649
Can you hear me?

01:14:06.683 --> 01:14:09.065
- What do you got for me?

01:14:09.099 --> 01:14:10.342
- I'm sending you
the directions now.

01:14:12.758 --> 01:14:14.242
- Got it.

01:14:14.277 --> 01:14:16.348
[motor buzzing]

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:22.009
- Hurry.

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.743
- Heavenly father looks
after all His children,

01:14:31.777 --> 01:14:34.746
cares for them and
protects them.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.369
But my father

01:14:37.403 --> 01:14:40.441
rejected his own sacred
duty to do the same.

01:14:44.307 --> 01:14:46.999
So tortured by the
gilt of his sins

01:14:48.863 --> 01:14:50.796
and the lust of
this corrupt flesh

01:14:53.316 --> 01:14:55.698
that he couldn't even
bear to hold me.

01:14:57.838 --> 01:14:59.702
I was punished just
for being born.

01:15:06.605 --> 01:15:08.883
[motor buzzing]

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:17.029
- [Steve] Fuck!

01:15:17.478 --> 01:15:19.307
- It must be nearby.

01:15:19.342 --> 01:15:22.587
Some place called Skin
Flats Metal Works.

01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:24.589
Oh and it looks like our killer

01:15:24.623 --> 01:15:26.211
was also trained in the army.

01:15:28.075 --> 01:15:30.595
Dishonorably discharged
for unstable behavior.

01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:32.182
- Fucking great.

01:15:32.217 --> 01:15:33.701
Okay.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:38.672
[foreboding music]

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.298
- My father cared more about
the strangers in his flock

01:15:45.955 --> 01:15:46.714
than his own flesh and blood.

01:15:48.682 --> 01:15:50.960
- Is that why you killed him?

01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:51.788
Because of a
neglected childhood?

01:15:53.031 --> 01:15:55.412
- No.

01:15:55.447 --> 01:15:58.761
I killed him because he placed
his faith above his duty.

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:07.804
And at confessional I told
him time and time again

01:16:07.839 --> 01:16:08.840
I was going to kill someone.

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.050
I even gave him the dead!

01:16:14.673 --> 01:16:17.158
[ominous beat music]

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.652
But does he tell the police?

01:16:27.686 --> 01:16:28.411
Have me arrested?

01:16:30.344 --> 01:16:33.968
No, he knew what was
going to happen

01:16:34.003 --> 01:16:36.005
but he did nothing to change it!

01:16:39.284 --> 01:16:41.044
[clanking]

01:16:44.289 --> 01:16:48.051
The sacred trust of
the confessional

01:16:48.086 --> 01:16:51.399
triumphed over the
value of a human life.

01:16:55.714 --> 01:16:57.267
- Simon!

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.236
- For I am there

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.447
with the rod and the staff!

01:17:04.481 --> 01:17:06.104
I humble thee!

01:17:06.863 --> 01:17:09.486
[screaming]

01:17:09.521 --> 01:17:12.248
[suspenseful music]

01:17:12.282 --> 01:17:13.801
- Simon!
