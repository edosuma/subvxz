a bilateral fractured radius.

39:14.710 --> 39:15.910
What happened?

39:15.912 --> 39:18.855
I was...injured.

39:18.973 --> 39:21.358
Line of duty.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.008
Took some time to heal.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.269
Not everything heals
in six months.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.771
You're right about that.

39:26.848 --> 39:29.324
My arm's fixed,
but the rest of me?

39:31.277 --> 39:33.094
I even lied to my husband
this morning.

39:33.121 --> 39:36.206
Told him that
I would be all right.

39:36.366 --> 39:39.283
Didn't mention that
it took everything in my being

39:39.360 --> 39:41.936
to get out of that bed
this morning

39:41.963 --> 39:44.939
and pick up this badge.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.699
Then I lied to my captain.

39:46.760 --> 39:51.279
Hell, maybe I've been
lying to myself.

39:51.281 --> 39:53.798
What do you think
those shoes are?

39:53.916 --> 39:55.875
And this outfit?
And the makeup?

39:55.894 --> 39:59.287
(sighing)
It's the same lie.

39:59.289 --> 40:01.881
It's a game
that I play with myself

40:01.900 --> 40:04.459
that someday...

40:04.461 --> 40:07.737
maybe...I will go out there.

40:07.897 --> 40:10.798
(sniffling)

40:10.800 --> 40:12.892
And then I never do.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.637
But now you really need to,

40:15.639 --> 40:18.856
because this hill is about
to come down on itself

40:18.917 --> 40:20.825
and take you with it.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.661
Maybe I should let it.

40:23.779 --> 40:26.256
You got up this morning.

40:26.374 --> 40:28.483
And put on makeup.

40:28.485 --> 40:32.095
(chuckles)
You're still in the game.

40:32.172 --> 40:33.988
It's the motion sensor
on Mount Lee.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.915
-Mount Lee?
-Hollywood Hills.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.659
Our comm towers are out there.

40:37.661 --> 40:38.751
So is my mom.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.161
Wait, is that another quake?

40:40.163 --> 40:41.587
JOSH:
I'm not feeling it.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.973
But we have cameras there
in case of trespassers.

40:44.133 --> 40:47.852
Okay, there's the sign.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.612
-Is it moving?
-MAY: Oh, my God.

40:49.731 --> 40:52.615
