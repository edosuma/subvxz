WEBVTT

01:26.294 --> 01:28.254
<i>This is Gotham Air One
reporting in.</i>

01:28.588 --> 01:30.047
Things are actually quiet, for once.

01:33.759 --> 01:34.969
- You see that?
- What?

01:35.303 --> 01:38.139
I had a blip.
It just ghosted across my screen.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.391
- I don't see anything.
- It was there.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.393
Whatever it is,
it must be right below us.

01:44.353 --> 01:45.855
- There it is.
- There what is?

01:46.314 --> 01:48.524
It looked like bat wings.

01:49.108 --> 01:50.192
Bat wings?

01:50.443 --> 01:53.237
Okay, take us up through those clouds,
just in case.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.663
Sorry, kid.

02:02.997 --> 02:04.248
There's nothing up here.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.875
I swear, I saw it.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.252
Something was flying
around up here.

02:32.693 --> 02:34.195
Testing, one, two, three.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.155
Testing, one, two, three.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.115
You, too, can fulfill the dream

02:38.282 --> 02:39.825
of being a high-paid radio personality

02:40.117 --> 02:41.786
in your spare time, just like me.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.496
Just call...

02:45.081 --> 02:47.416
Just call
the Gotham Institute of Broadcast Arts.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.335
Yeah, that's better.
Call the Gotham...

03:14.276 --> 03:15.820
Get away!

03:44.724 --> 03:46.642
I didn't authorize
this statement, Detective.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.227
Come on, Commissioner.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.354
Somebody asked me
a couple of questions.

03:50.896 --> 03:52.690
I just gave them
a couple of answers.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.984
You gave them without my approval.

03:55.651 --> 03:58.112
If you'd kept quiet, he wouldn't know
we're moving against him.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.447
I'll find him.

03:59.613 --> 04:01.574
Ijust need
a little extra help, Your Honor.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.075
What kind of help?

04:03.242 --> 04:04.285
I want my own tactical squad

04:04.785 --> 04:07.663
for the sole purpose
of throwing a net over this Batman.

04:08.038 --> 04:10.624
- Commissioner?
- I've already denied the request.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.586
Nobody's taking a vigilante force
onto my streets.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.672
Your Honor, any nutcase
that dresses up like a bat,

04:17.047 --> 04:18.507
sooner or later is gonna snap.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.718
Listen, it's just not Batman's M.0.

04:21.218 --> 04:23.721
Oh, yeah? Tell that to the guy
he just tossed through the window.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.223
I think we could
spare a few men, Commissioner.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.351
Detective Bullock does have a reputation
for getting results.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.520
I'm authorizing the strike force.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.105
Anything else, Detective?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.192
Just make sure the D.A.'s office
can give me an airtight case, sir.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.027
If you catch him, Harvey,

04:38.110 --> 04:39.570
I'll put him in jail for you.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.414
"Gotham police
declare war on Batman"?

04:50.748 --> 04:51.749
I gather you've been reading

04:52.041 --> 04:54.084
<i>How to Make Friends
and Influence People.</i>

04:55.961 --> 04:57.129
Somebody's setting me up.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.380
My heavens.

04:58.881 --> 04:59.965
You mean, it wasn't you

05:00.132 --> 05:01.801
tossing guards
out of windows last night?

05:02.343 --> 05:04.136
I only toss butlers, Alfred.

05:04.386 --> 05:06.555
Look here.
There were two very quiet burglaries

05:06.931 --> 05:08.557
at other pharmaceutical
companies this week.

05:08.974 --> 05:10.100
Nobody hurt like last night,

05:11.018 --> 05:12.937
but chemicals stolen just the same.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.772
And you suspect a pattern?

05:15.189 --> 05:16.649
Only one way to find out.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.360
I'II cancel
Master Bruce's rendezvous with

05:19.777 --> 05:21.195
Bambi, was it, sir?

05:21.529 --> 05:22.988
Yes, Alfred, do that.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.173
Come here, you.

06:27.344 --> 06:29.179
- He's back.
- I'II call the police.

06:52.661 --> 06:53.954
<i><i>Calling Detective Bullock.</i></i>

06:54.038 --> 06:55.122
<i>Calling Detective Bullock.</i>

06:55.831 --> 06:56.832
Yeah?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.126
<i>The Batman's been sighted
breaking into Phoenix labs.</i>

06:59.460 --> 07:00.628
<i>Thought you'd be interested.</i>

07:01.045 --> 07:03.339
I want my squad there,
backed by choppers

07:03.589 --> 07:06.342
and as many officers
as you can get now.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.473
You're mine.

08:03.482 --> 08:04.566
<i><i>Call the Gotham...</i></i>

08:40.519 --> 08:42.354
All right, you jokers,
pipe down!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.314
He's in there.

08:44.523 --> 08:46.191
I want him
by any means necessary.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.541
Commissioner, you're just in time

09:02.875 --> 09:04.626
to see us hang this bat upside down.

09:07.212 --> 09:08.213
You sure he's in there?

09:08.756 --> 09:11.091
The chopper pilots just spotted him
on the fourth floor.

09:11.633 --> 09:13.177
Well, he can't be in two places at once.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.430
Another pharmaceutical factory
was just robbed across town.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.974
- You've got the wrong suspect.
- What?

09:29.109 --> 09:30.110
There!

09:35.616 --> 09:36.617
Gas attack.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.494
Put on your masks.

09:47.669 --> 09:49.004
Hey, there he is.

09:52.549 --> 09:54.593
Well, somebody's in there, Commissioner.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.637
Call them off, Bullock, or I will.

10:09.024 --> 10:11.193
The Bat's got to be in there, sir.
What do you think?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.117
- Tear gas?
- We'll smoke him out.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.577
Okay, men, ready with your masks.

11:01.785 --> 11:04.454
<i>The Gotham Zoo tour tram
departs in five minutes.</i>

11:06.582 --> 11:07.791
<i>Adventures in Chiroptery,</i>

11:08.041 --> 11:10.043
<i>at the Bat Exhibit,
will begin in 30 minutes.</i>

11:18.385 --> 11:19.595
Hello?

11:20.012 --> 11:21.054
Anybody here?

11:22.806 --> 11:24.183
Dr. March?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.477
Who is it?

11:28.812 --> 11:30.480
Bruce Wayne.
I have an appointment.

11:30.647 --> 11:31.982
I called about a bat problem.

11:32.232 --> 11:34.401
What do you think we are?
Pest control?

11:34.651 --> 11:36.945
- I just need--
- Yes. Come in.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.031
Why, thank you, Doctor.

11:39.489 --> 11:41.909
You donate a few million,
and you think you own the place.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.078
I understand
I'm to analyze something for you.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.041
Yeah, Doc.
I keep hearing squeaks in my chimney

11:49.499 --> 11:51.084
and I found these in my empty fireplace.

11:51.376 --> 11:52.753
They look like hairs.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.464
I thought maybe you could tell me
if I have a bat problem.

11:55.797 --> 11:58.342
And what if they are bats, Mr. Wayne?
What then?

11:58.675 --> 12:00.427
Destroy them like insects?

12:00.802 --> 12:03.305
We won't survive
the next evolutionary cataclysm,

12:03.555 --> 12:04.806
but bats will.

12:05.098 --> 12:07.434
They're survivors, Mr. Wayne,
not pests.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.144
You should understand that.

12:09.394 --> 12:10.479
Dad?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.982
I hope Mr. Wayne understands
you mean no disrespect.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.568
Of course not, Miss...

12:17.194 --> 12:19.112
Mrs.
Actually, Doctor.

12:19.529 --> 12:20.614
I'm Francine Langstrom.

12:20.989 --> 12:22.699
I think you spoke with my husband
on the phone.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.078
Oh, Mr. Wayne,
I'm sorry I'm late.

12:26.286 --> 12:27.621
I'm Kirk Langstrom.

12:27.829 --> 12:29.248
Did you bring the sample?

12:29.706 --> 12:31.458
I gave it to Dr. Mar...

12:32.125 --> 12:33.210
Where'd he go?

12:33.377 --> 12:35.003
Probably to get started on the analysis.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.881
If it's a bat problem,
we'll know by tonight.

12:38.548 --> 12:41.176
Dad was lecturing Mr. Wayne
on the virtues of chiroptera.

12:41.843 --> 12:43.095
Chiropt-a-what?

12:43.387 --> 12:44.596
Chiroptera. Bats.

12:44.846 --> 12:47.766
And I hope he didn't get carried away?

12:47.975 --> 12:50.811
He's a little protective of all this.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.064
I think he likes bats
better than people.

12:54.564 --> 12:55.816
I can't imagine.

12:56.024 --> 12:57.150
I brought you this, too.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.486
It's a recording I made
of the noise in my chimney.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.705
That doesn't sound like any bat
I've ever heard, Mr. Wayne.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.627
The animal-behavior people
have a sound library.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.129
Maybe they can identify it.

13:17.629 --> 13:18.922
We'll let you know.

13:19.339 --> 13:20.674
I'd appreciate it.

13:28.849 --> 13:32.436
I didn't realize you'd taken up
listening to rock 'n' roll, sir.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.646
You know, I actually did check this

13:34.980 --> 13:36.315
against any musical sounds.

13:36.523 --> 13:38.692
Computer still can't come close
to pinpointing it.

13:42.195 --> 13:44.364
Wayne Manor.
One moment, please.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.325
A call for Master Bruce

13:46.408 --> 13:47.993
from a Dr. March.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.371
Hey, what's up, Doc?

13:51.580 --> 13:52.914
<i>You have bats, Mr. Wayne.</i>

13:53.081 --> 13:54.291
<i>Common brown bats.</i>

13:54.541 --> 13:55.876
They shouldn't pose a problem.

13:56.084 --> 13:57.794
As the weather gets colder,
they'll move on.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.504
<i>What about the sound on the tape?</i>

13:59.838 --> 14:01.131
It's actually two sounds.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.716
Starlings and brown bats.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.093
Probably fighting over
a nest in your chimney.

14:05.552 --> 14:06.636
Appreciate the help, Doc.

14:06.928 --> 14:09.389
I'II return the favor
next time you're raising funds.

14:09.556 --> 14:10.682
Bye-bye.

14:11.099 --> 14:12.476
This computer checked that fiber

14:12.809 --> 14:14.853
against every animal species
known to man.

14:15.937 --> 14:18.648
I went to them because I thought
they might know something we didn't.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.109
That hair wasn't a brown bat's.

14:21.943 --> 14:24.071
And those melodic sounds?

14:24.446 --> 14:27.324
Computer, check against combined sounds.

14:27.657 --> 14:29.326
Starlings and brown bats.

14:32.245 --> 14:33.372
<i>Negative.</i>

14:33.580 --> 14:35.374
<i>Sounds not originated
by either species.</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:38.085
I would say, sir,

14:38.335 --> 14:40.879
that we have ourselves an incongruity.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.464
Incongruity, Alfred?

14:43.006 --> 14:44.132
He's lying.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.134
And I'm gonna find out why.

15:21.336 --> 15:23.463
Can't fight it.
It's got me.

15:54.828 --> 15:55.871
Who's back there?

15:57.038 --> 15:59.541
You!
I'm looking far Dr. March.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.543
He's not here, Batman.

16:04.212 --> 16:05.213
Where is he?

16:05.380 --> 16:07.757
Giving a lecture
on human extinction

16:07.924 --> 16:09.176
and bat evolution.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.261
He's really quite brilliant.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.513
He's misguided and a thief.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.348
He's just a theorist.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.267
He was afraid
to put it to the test.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.019
But I wasn't.

16:19.519 --> 16:21.229
I knew we'd discovered a formula

16:21.396 --> 16:23.106
to create a totally new species.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.941
Neither man nor bat.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.860
And once I started taking it,

16:27.068 --> 16:28.111
I couldn't stop.

16:28.361 --> 16:29.863
I desperately wanted to.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.240
But it took over.

16:32.949 --> 16:35.118
Francine and March
tried to protect me,

16:35.744 --> 16:36.953
but it was too late.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.540
The beast knew what chemicals
were needed to bring itself about.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.501
It was out of my control.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.962
And it only needs one more component

16:46.213 --> 16:48.089
to complete the process.

16:48.798 --> 16:50.509
It's in me,

16:50.842 --> 16:52.010
Batman.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.730
Kirk!

18:23.518 --> 18:25.395
I'm getting something strange.

18:25.895 --> 18:27.230
Oh, not again!

18:27.564 --> 18:29.566
I'm serious.
It's right below us.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.111
Whoa!

18:33.570 --> 18:35.322
Gotham Command, we need choppers.

18:35.655 --> 18:37.115
We've sighted the Batman.

18:55.508 --> 18:57.427
- Let's go!
- I can't do it, sir.

18:57.802 --> 18:59.095
What do you mean you can't do it?

18:59.387 --> 19:02.015
I just got word not to let you up
without the Commissioner.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.601
- Who told you that?
- The Commissioner.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.478
Get out, Detective!

19:07.812 --> 19:09.481
The Mayor may not let me fire you,

19:09.814 --> 19:11.941
but I am not taking the heat
for your fiascoes.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.903
This is my case, Commissioner!
You heard the Mayor!

19:15.070 --> 19:17.155
Then why don't you go
take it up with him?

19:17.322 --> 19:18.573
I've got a job to do.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.909
If you want to tag along,
fine!

19:23.578 --> 19:24.913
Take her up, Lieutenant.

19:26.581 --> 19:27.916
Hey, wait for me!

20:15.463 --> 20:17.340
- There he is.
- There they are.

20:18.758 --> 20:20.009
What is that thing?

20:20.301 --> 20:21.720
That thing is what we're after.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.638
Holy...

20:58.006 --> 20:59.215
Two for dinner, sir?

20:59.507 --> 21:02.385
I got a list of all the items
stolen from the chemical labs.

21:03.219 --> 21:06.014
Who would have thought
they'd be used to create a monster?

21:07.474 --> 21:10.560
Maybe I can undo the fate
Langstrom has brought upon himself.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.733
Does it appear feasible, sir?

21:17.358 --> 21:18.735
I think so.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.334
Is he all right?

21:37.796 --> 21:39.547
- Will he change again?
- No.

21:40.131 --> 21:41.508
The formula's out of his system.

21:42.091 --> 21:43.384
It's over...
