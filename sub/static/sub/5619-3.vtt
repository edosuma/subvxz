00:02.003 --> 00:04.046
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.130 --> 00:05.632
So you think the rock is a portal?

00:05.715 --> 00:08.218
A crack in space-time that carried
Simmons away to another planet.

00:08.301 --> 00:09.344
Fitz!

00:09.427 --> 00:10.887
<i>- Which means...</i>
<i>- She's out there.</i>

00:13.348 --> 00:16.518
HYDRA's fractured.
We're going to rebuild it the right way.

00:16.601 --> 00:17.936
- What's your way in?
- From below.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.355
Climb the ranks.
Hail HYDRA and all that.

00:20.438 --> 00:23.024
I'm gonna nab a payload from these
gunrunners to establish my cover.

00:23.108 --> 00:25.694
I get that you're trying to
build a life here, but...

00:25.777 --> 00:27.862
Yes, a normal life. So stay out of it.

00:27.946 --> 00:31.199
<i>I have created
a special task force, the ATCU,</i>

00:31.282 --> 00:34.452
<i>to neutralise these alien threats.</i>

00:34.577 --> 00:36.371
Come with us. We'll keep you safe.
Your life is in danger.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.081
My life is in ruins.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.224
He's moving north.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.268
Use lethal force if necessary!

01:10.655 --> 01:12.157
Hurry up, let's go.

01:12.407 --> 01:13.658
Down this trail!

01:15.326 --> 01:16.661
Move it! Move it!

01:18.329 --> 01:19.664
There.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.090
We're losing him.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.304
Stop!

01:37.348 --> 01:38.767
Fall back!

01:45.356 --> 01:47.692
Unit two can try and head him off.

01:47.776 --> 01:49.694
But get her on the phone.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.030
Tell her we lost him.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.991
It's time to bring everyone in on this.

02:20.225 --> 02:21.726
<i>Simmons didn't have to
go through quarantine,</i>

02:21.851 --> 02:23.228
<i>which is good, all things considered.</i>

02:23.311 --> 02:25.814
What exactly are these "things"
that we're "considering"?

02:25.897 --> 02:28.316
Everything that comes with
being on another planet for months.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.902
Different atmosphere,
different levels of oxygenation,

02:30.985 --> 02:32.320
different microgravity.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.074
<i>Every system in her body
is out of whack.</i>

02:36.157 --> 02:38.576
<i>Cardiovascular, inner ear, respiratory,</i>

02:38.701 --> 02:40.745
<i>all got used to being not here.</i>

02:40.829 --> 02:42.997
<i>Labs indicate oxidative stress,</i>

02:43.081 --> 02:46.084
<i>vitamin D deficiency,
upper respiratory irritation.</i>

02:47.377 --> 02:49.838
<i>Any mention of life,
intelligent or otherwise?</i>

02:49.921 --> 02:52.173
<i>Some flora. No fauna.</i>

02:52.257 --> 02:53.758
<i>She said she was being hunted.</i>

02:53.883 --> 02:55.677
Wait, what? What does that mean?
Hunted by what?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.512
She didn't say.
I don't know if she even knows.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.013
My God.

02:59.097 --> 03:01.683
Imagine her having to go through
all that alone, for that long...

03:01.766 --> 03:03.685
Well, thanks to this guy, not any more.

03:15.905 --> 03:17.115
<i>Monitor her physical health.</i>

03:17.240 --> 03:19.033
I've got to call in to Dr Garner.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.369
Her mental health is just as important.

03:21.452 --> 03:24.122
But don't push her.
She'll open up when she's ready.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.959
Lincoln's in trouble.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.130
The ATCU issued a nation-wide BOLO.

03:32.255 --> 03:35.383
FBI, Homeland Security,
local police, all notified.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.385
Sent them Lincoln's resume
and headshot.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.387
Sounds like
the ATCU's getting desperate.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.722
What are they going to do
when they find him?

03:40.805 --> 03:42.724
I'm guessing it won't be awesome.
He needs help.

03:42.807 --> 03:45.393
Look, we went to Lincoln more
than once. He didn't want our help.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.812
It doesn't mean he deserves
to be hunted like a fugitive.

03:47.937 --> 03:50.732
Not to mention, there's a giant
with a grudge looking to kill him.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.817
Which is why we
need to bring him in. Now.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.402
That would be the plan
if we knew where to find him,

03:54.485 --> 03:56.404
but he's not messaging me back and I...

03:57.780 --> 03:58.823
What?

03:59.991 --> 04:01.159
You want to tell her?

04:01.242 --> 04:03.077
Great, tell me what?

04:03.161 --> 04:04.746
What do neither of you want to tell me?

04:04.829 --> 04:06.664
We know how to find him.

04:17.926 --> 04:20.011
<i>- Lincoln, it's me.</i>
- Daisy?

04:20.094 --> 04:22.012
How the hell did you get this number?

04:22.847 --> 04:23.932
That's not important.

04:24.015 --> 04:26.184
What's important right now
is that you get somewhere safe.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.435
<i>I just bought this phone.</i>

04:27.518 --> 04:29.604
Yes, I know,
35 minutes ago at a liquor store

04:29.687 --> 04:31.314
at 71st and Binford.

04:33.358 --> 04:34.776
- You know where I am?
<i>- Yes.</i>

04:34.859 --> 04:36.611
And I convinced them
to let me talk to you before...

04:36.694 --> 04:37.779
<i>I can't believe you would do this.</i>

04:37.862 --> 04:39.280
Just... Lincoln, just hear me out, okay?

04:39.364 --> 04:41.866
The ATCU has released your picture
to law enforcement.

04:41.950 --> 04:44.619
It's everywhere. Calling for your arrest.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.162
We're gonna come get you.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.122
Lincoln?

04:57.966 --> 05:00.385
You're not walking out of here until
my partner has said her piece.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.067
He must have blown his tracker.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.945
Yeah, because he's creeped out
that you put a tracker in him.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.321
Yeah, if she didn't
give him a heads up,

05:20.405 --> 05:21.531
we could've used it to bring him in.

05:21.614 --> 05:23.491
He's already scared, paranoid.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.618
Ambushing him out of nowhere
would have made things way worse.

05:25.702 --> 05:28.162
And he would have been able to
express those feelings to us here,

05:28.246 --> 05:29.372
secure in our location.

05:29.455 --> 05:32.250
All right, all right.
Everybody, just relax.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.585
We'll figure this out.

05:36.421 --> 05:37.588
He should be in here.

05:37.672 --> 05:39.841
We did a couple of jobs together
a while back.

05:39.924 --> 05:41.467
He's tight with HYDRA in the UK

05:41.551 --> 05:44.303
and continued his association
when he relocated here to the US.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.349
There he is.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.517
You lead.

05:53.730 --> 05:54.772
Spud!

05:55.606 --> 05:57.150
- Crikeys!
- Richy!

05:58.109 --> 05:59.485
As I live and breathe.

05:59.569 --> 06:00.820
- I'm liking the bum-fluff.
- Ah!

06:00.903 --> 06:03.448
- Oh, Gina, Spud. Spud, Gina.
- Hey.

06:04.032 --> 06:07.076
Whoo! Classy for the likes of you, eh?

06:07.160 --> 06:08.202
Business associates.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.954
Mmm. Come here.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.374
Whoa!

06:14.208 --> 06:15.710
First round's on me.

06:15.793 --> 06:16.961
- Oh, nice one.
- Oi!

06:18.838 --> 06:21.215
Uh, so, Richy tells us you're the guy
to go to if we need to unload...

06:21.299 --> 06:22.341
Hold your horses.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.136
That's not how it's done.
First, we drink, then we talk business.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.181
Oi! Three pints.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.269
Right. 'Cause you guys aren't
hard enough to understand as it is.

06:58.294 --> 07:00.755
Yeah, you're right. I did, didn't I?

07:01.589 --> 07:04.175
Man, classic road trip.

07:04.926 --> 07:06.886
All right, he's a muppet.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.889
But if we don't start talking shop soon,
he's gonna pass out, so...

07:09.972 --> 07:11.140
Have something to unload?

07:11.224 --> 07:12.266
Weapons.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.936
Next gen, high potential damage.

07:15.019 --> 07:18.147
We need buyers with deep pockets
and bad intentions.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.400
A finder's fee for you, of course.

07:25.655 --> 07:27.698
I know people.

07:27.782 --> 07:29.534
But they have massive trust issues.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.828
What do they want,
a letter of recommendation?

07:31.911 --> 07:33.955
Me vouching won't be enough.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.040
Well, what is? Do I buy my way in?

07:36.124 --> 07:37.542
No.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.127
You fight your way in.

07:39.210 --> 07:42.630
If you are the last man standing,
you'll get a meeting.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.592
Sounds like a laugh.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.887
<i>The suspect is considered dangerous</i>

07:49.971 --> 07:52.765
<i>and is wanted by both
federal authorities and the ATCU.</i>

07:52.849 --> 07:55.226
This just went from bad
to really, really bad.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.811
They've gone public.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.772
<i>If you do see this man, do not engage.</i>

08:03.776 --> 08:05.695
<i>Well, it looks like
another wet one, folks.</i>

08:05.778 --> 08:08.239
<i>Possible thunderstorms
over the next few hours.</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:11.492
<i>Cloudy tomorrow,
with a 50% chance of precipitation.</i>

08:11.576 --> 08:13.911
<i>In other news,
a suspect has been identified</i>

08:13.995 --> 08:16.706
<i>in the Cincinnati hospital
alien terrorist attack</i>

08:16.789 --> 08:20.168
<i>that left three dead, many more injured.</i>

08:20.251 --> 08:23.087
<i>If you have any information
about the man pictured here,</i>

08:23.171 --> 08:24.630
<i>be sure to contact the authorities.</i>

08:36.350 --> 08:37.602
Hey.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.020
You're him.

08:40.855 --> 08:42.315
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.192
I saw you.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.818
I know what you are.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.655
You have no idea.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.543
Daisy, I need you to monitor
all law enforcement

09:02.627 --> 09:03.878
near Lincoln's last known location.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.379
How about we take a team
and go look for ourselves?

09:05.463 --> 09:07.715
No. The ATCU is on a witch hunt
for powered people.

09:07.798 --> 09:08.841
I'm not afraid of them.

09:08.925 --> 09:11.636
No, but they're terrified of you,
which makes them dangerous.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.387
Until we know where he is,
you're not going out there.

09:13.471 --> 09:14.722
Permission to speak freely.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.933
- Do I have a choice?
- I could have talked him in

09:17.016 --> 09:19.685
if you didn't put an unsolicited tracker
under his skin.

09:19.769 --> 09:21.229
If you didn't call to alert him,
then we...

09:21.312 --> 09:22.355
Why wasn't I told?

09:22.438 --> 09:23.940
We thought you were
a little close to the situation.

09:24.023 --> 09:25.608
Of course I'm close to the situation.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.110
You asked me to assemble a team
and I accepted.

09:28.194 --> 09:29.612
I didn't expect to be undermined...

09:29.695 --> 09:31.739
Do you know what I didn't expect?
A global outbreak.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.075
The ATCU. Their Inhuman manhunt.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.327
I didn't see all that coming,
to be honest.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.537
I wanted to assemble a team,
to get ahead of the problem,

09:38.621 --> 09:39.664
but that didn't happen.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.123
So, Daisy...

09:41.207 --> 09:42.541
I'll scan law enforcement channels.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.668
Thank you.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.088
Mack, you were able to identify
Rosalind Price's photo.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.214
- Mmm-hmm.
- How about getting me her digits?

09:48.297 --> 09:49.340
You got it.

09:50.967 --> 09:53.052
Still acclimating to less gravity.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.265
Now this is a sight for sore eyes.

09:57.348 --> 09:59.058
I thought it would be good
to get back in the lab,

09:59.141 --> 10:00.184
see the old workspace.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.062
Is that it?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.480
It was the portal.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.773
Now it's a pile of space rocks.

10:05.898 --> 10:09.151
I've run a complete
and exhaustive set of diagnostics,

10:09.235 --> 10:11.654
so I can assure you
there's no need to worry.

10:15.533 --> 10:16.951
You okay?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.287
Fine.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.164
Just a sec.
It's Hunter. He's on a Ward hunt.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.292
Say hi.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.960
You know it.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.254
Hey, look.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.755
Just as you left it.

10:29.839 --> 10:33.175
Made sure not even a Post-it note was
moved, 'cause I know how particular...

10:38.180 --> 10:39.348
What is it?

10:40.308 --> 10:42.560
Um, I'm just...

10:42.643 --> 10:45.438
I'm not accustomed
to this many distractions.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.357
Yeah. Well, I imagine you must
have had quite a lot to take in,

10:48.441 --> 10:51.068
extraterrestrial materials
and specimens to examine...

10:51.152 --> 10:53.988
My curiosity faded once the fear set in.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.574
Right. Yeah. No, of course.

10:56.657 --> 10:57.700
Sorry.

10:59.410 --> 11:02.872
Uh, I have to admit, it's all a bit much.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.498
Would you mind?

11:04.582 --> 11:06.959
- Uh, yeah. Well, should I get Bobbi?
- No.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.296
Um, it's just a little disorientation,

11:10.379 --> 11:12.214
attributable to oxidative stress.

11:12.298 --> 11:14.592
Okay, yeah.
I'll take you back to your room.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.763
I hope
you're not too disappointed.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.223
No, on the contrary,
you're self-diagnosing,

11:21.307 --> 11:23.184
which is a sign you're on the mend.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.770
<i>And how is she now?</i>

11:25.853 --> 11:27.605
As weirded out as you'd be
after being stranded for months

11:27.688 --> 11:28.814
in another solar system.

11:28.898 --> 11:32.610
<i>Oh, I must say, HQ sounds a lot
more fun than what we're up to.</i>

11:32.693 --> 11:34.278
Why don't I believe you?

11:34.362 --> 11:35.988
And why do you sound hungover?

11:36.072 --> 11:37.823
Because I am hungover.

11:37.907 --> 11:39.658
There's nothing to do here but drink.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.620
Planes, trains and automobiles,

11:42.703 --> 11:45.539
chasing down leads,
still no sign of Ward.

11:45.623 --> 11:49.210
<i>So, you're not doing anything stupid?</i>

11:49.293 --> 11:50.461
Mmm, not yet.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.755
But one of those trains
is about to leave the station,

11:52.838 --> 11:54.256
and I need to get on it.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.094
Good luck. Don't die.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.262
Only thing I'll die of is boredom.

12:06.519 --> 12:08.104
You lied to her.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.564
Barely.

12:10.648 --> 12:12.900
Besides, she knows I'm lying,
so it's not even really a lie.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.444
Works for us. For now.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.863
You know how complicated
these things can be.

12:17.947 --> 12:19.365
Affairs of the heart.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.325
Especially in our line of work.

12:21.409 --> 12:24.578
Me and Bob, you and Andrew...

12:27.248 --> 12:29.834
So, you trust Spud?

12:31.419 --> 12:34.171
Trust's a strong word for a psychopath.

12:34.255 --> 12:37.633
He's a murderous thief who I once saw
bite a man's nose clean off.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.385
But he'll get us through the door.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.263
You'll find this funny.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.640
Back at HQ,
we've got a little wager going

12:44.723 --> 12:46.809
on what happened
between you and the good Doctor.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.019
My guess is you walked away.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.646
Not in a huff or anything,

12:50.729 --> 12:53.315
just couldn't stand
the constant talking and sharing.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.860
It's true, I don't like a lot of talking.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.613
This fight, it's our way to Ward.

12:59.697 --> 13:02.032
So if you're going to do this,
you need to win.

13:02.116 --> 13:03.576
Are you suggesting I can't win?

13:03.659 --> 13:04.910
I'm not saying you can't.

13:04.994 --> 13:06.412
But I know I can.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.830
Spud runs with a type,

13:07.913 --> 13:09.707
and if that type sees
a small Asian woman

13:09.790 --> 13:12.251
destroy some wannabe HYDRA thug
in a bare-knuckle brawl,

13:12.334 --> 13:13.919
that type will talk.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.921
And word might spread up the ranks.

13:16.005 --> 13:17.756
I see your point.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.803
You're just anxious to bash some heads
after being out of the game.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.433
Look, I've rarely lost a fight
when I'm sober,

13:27.516 --> 13:29.059
which I plan on being.

13:29.143 --> 13:30.186
And I can take a punch.

13:30.269 --> 13:32.688
So, worst case,
I do that till the other guy tires out.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.236
So how much do you have
riding on this bet?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.030
That I left Andrew.

13:41.113 --> 13:43.324
A significant sum.

13:44.492 --> 13:46.452
Well.

13:46.535 --> 13:47.703
You lost it.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.133
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.594
Have you been drinking?

14:03.677 --> 14:07.139
I wanted to. Instead, I called you.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.642
You're the only one I trust.

14:10.559 --> 14:11.602
Get in.

14:15.648 --> 14:17.858
That's a hell of a long way for a ride.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.610
I know.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.278
I'll take care of the tolls
on the way back.

14:21.612 --> 14:22.655
Ah.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.337
You slept the whole drive.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.798
I was pretty wiped out.

14:42.216 --> 14:45.052
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
for the hilarious tale of why.

14:46.095 --> 14:48.180
You didn't call
to have me talk you off a ledge.

14:48.264 --> 14:50.683
Not this time, anyway.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.396
Lincoln, what's going on?

14:58.315 --> 15:00.609
Uh, I'm in a little bit of trouble.

15:00.693 --> 15:03.362
You're killing me with these details.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.822
You don't want to know.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.576
Look, it's a misunderstanding.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.537
I promise you
I haven't done anything wrong.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.748
Okay, that is all I need to hear.

15:14.832 --> 15:17.585
I know what kind of man you are.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.336
Just tell me what you need.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.674
I was hoping, uh...

15:23.757 --> 15:26.302
You'd let me buy your car off of you.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.929
I know it's a lot to ask.
Uh, I'll pay cash.

15:29.013 --> 15:30.139
Done.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.352
John, I don't know what to say.

15:35.436 --> 15:37.354
All right, now, wait a minute.
You're doing me a favour.

15:37.438 --> 15:38.814
It's a pile of rust.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.691
All right, I'll make us some dinner.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.859
Or, I don't know, take a nap,

15:41.942 --> 15:44.445
or the shower's over there,
if you wanna take a shower.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.904
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

15:46.947 --> 15:48.407
It's gonna be okay.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.571
He didn't just disappear.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.031
Unless he did.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.449
Well, he can't do that, can he?

16:30.532 --> 16:31.700
No.

16:31.784 --> 16:33.035
Electric's his thing.

16:33.702 --> 16:34.953
He'll show.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.872
That's why we alerted the public.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.332
He's got nowhere to hide.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.667
I hope so.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.586
We need to start making progress,
showing results.

16:42.670 --> 16:43.796
Ms Price, you have a call.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.297
Well, it can wait.

16:45.381 --> 16:46.423
It's the White House.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.684
Uh, throw it up on my screen.

17:00.396 --> 17:01.814
Coulson?

17:01.897 --> 17:03.107
<i>Call me Phil.</i>

17:03.190 --> 17:04.983
What I can't call you is POTUS.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.153
<i>You're not the only person
with a connection to the White House.</i>

17:08.278 --> 17:10.239
<i>Well, mine's a pirated
satellite connection</i>

17:10.321 --> 17:12.907
<i>that will be discovered soon,
so I'll be brief.</i>

17:12.991 --> 17:14.492
<i>You're making a lot of noise.</i>

17:14.617 --> 17:16.578
<i>And frankly, I'm a little insulted.</i>

17:16.662 --> 17:18.122
<i>You're asking everyone for help,</i>

17:18.204 --> 17:21.666
<i>the FBI, local police,
and now the public.</i>

17:21.791 --> 17:24.252
<i>Everyone except the people
who actually know something.</i>

17:24.336 --> 17:25.546
You mean you.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.339
<i>That is what I mean, yes.</i>

17:27.464 --> 17:29.174
<i>So I think we should meet.</i>

17:29.299 --> 17:32.302
<i>Just the two of us. In person.
Neutral ground.</i>

17:33.178 --> 17:35.222
Will you excuse me for a moment?

17:36.306 --> 17:38.183
We have a location
on Lincoln Campbell.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.645
He's holing up in an apartment
outside Chicago.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.355
You know what you need to do.

17:45.524 --> 17:48.402
Okay, Phil, let's meet.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.654
I think we'll have a lot to talk about.

18:00.748 --> 18:02.541
I cannot believe you're here.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.293
Skye!

18:04.376 --> 18:06.170
Daisy. I'm sorry.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.213
It's a multipurpose gift.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.799
It's pretty and a reminder.

18:10.883 --> 18:13.260
You can call me whatever you want.

18:14.178 --> 18:17.222
I can't stay for too long,
I'm tracking law enforcement channels,

18:17.347 --> 18:19.808
but I'm really sorry
that I haven't come sooner. It's...

18:19.892 --> 18:21.810
Just a lot going on.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.812
- And I've been sleeping.
- Which is good.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.731
Do whatever you need to get better.

18:25.856 --> 18:26.857
We need you.

18:28.859 --> 18:30.360
And I...

18:30.861 --> 18:33.197
I know you don't want to talk about
what happened yet,

18:33.280 --> 18:34.907
but when you do,
I'm here, for whatever you need.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.034
Right now, I'd rather listen.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.995
The Terrigen is spreading?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.747
So is the paranoia.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.210
Not exactly the penthouse view.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.420
You looking for something?

18:49.421 --> 18:52.424
Nah, just, it's hard to relax, you know?

18:53.926 --> 18:54.968
I know.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.933
Everything okay?

19:01.058 --> 19:02.726
Why wouldn't it be?

19:04.937 --> 19:06.063
Maybe I will hop in the shower.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.860
John, what's up?

19:11.944 --> 19:14.112
What's wrong?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.824
You just stay where you are,
don't touch me.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.867
Wait, what is going on?

19:18.951 --> 19:20.244
They'll be here any minute.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.955
- Who did you call?
- I called the hotline.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.707
They said that you're dangerous.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.543
Lincoln, they said
that you'd killed people.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.128
I never killed anyone, I swear.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.465
You said you know
what type of man I am.

19:33.590 --> 19:36.134
I don't even know what you are.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.678
They're saying you're an alien.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.263
- It's not at all what you think.
- Just stay there.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.015
Stay there! I'm not kidding, stay there!
They're gonna be here any minute.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.148
Here.

19:50.274 --> 19:51.400
I'm going to leave the money
and take the car.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.526
You don't need to be involved.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.069
Just stay back!

19:54.152 --> 19:55.279
Get out of my way!

19:59.825 --> 20:02.661
I'm sorry I brought you into this.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.378
No, no, no, no. John?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.548
Come on, John.

20:23.307 --> 20:24.308
<i>You're really okay?</i>

20:24.391 --> 20:26.977
I think so. I'm...

20:30.022 --> 20:31.148
Well, it's just...

20:32.566 --> 20:35.152
There's some of it
that's hard to talk about.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.361
And I...

20:37.487 --> 20:39.239
- I'm so sorry.
- No, take it.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.535
<i>Daisy?</i>

20:43.660 --> 20:44.912
Lincoln!

20:44.995 --> 20:47.331
I am so sorry.
I had no idea about the tracker.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.207
- And if I did...
<i>- Don't worry about that now.</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:51.209
<i>What's wrong?</i>

20:51.335 --> 20:53.003
<i>I need help.</i>

21:11.563 --> 21:12.606
Clear.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.774
He's not here.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.069
<i>Lincoln's hiding,
he's waiting for us.</i>

21:17.694 --> 21:18.862
We need to bring him in,

21:18.946 --> 21:21.114
preferably without the ATCU knowing.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.366
Even though he just killed a guy.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.034
I told you it was an accident.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.286
We'll figure it out
once we get him in here.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.664
It'd be safer
if Mack handled the extraction.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.541
I know, but then he won't come.
It's got to be me.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.251
Your call.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.212
And where are you going?

21:36.254 --> 21:38.548
To the beach.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.594
I'd give anything
to be in the field.

21:42.719 --> 21:46.556
Rehab is the antithesis of exciting,
I'm well aware.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.392
But it's worth it.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.769
You'll notice
I was able to say "antithesis."

21:53.647 --> 21:54.898
You check on Simmons?

21:54.982 --> 21:57.776
Yeah, she's kind of...

21:58.902 --> 21:59.945
Distant.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.239
I'm not sure that I know how to help her.

22:02.322 --> 22:05.158
What did you drill into my head
when I started rehabbing my knee?

22:06.118 --> 22:07.619
- Patience.
- Exactly.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.954
Yeah, I know, I know.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.831
It's just the lab.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.165
She loved that lab.

22:12.249 --> 22:16.044
Designed it
according to her specifications.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.754
Now it's...

22:19.589 --> 22:22.426
Could be, it reminds her
of the way things were.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.512
You know, all the time she lost.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.306
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

22:29.016 --> 22:31.018
Maybe forget about the things
that used to matter to her.

22:31.685 --> 22:33.478
Give her something to look forward to.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.272
Start fresh.

22:36.273 --> 22:37.441
Yeah.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.486
Yeah, maybe you're right. Thanks.

23:06.470 --> 23:09.306
Got to say, I was pretty surprised
when I got your call.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.724
Eyes up here.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.894
Busted. Sorry.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.520
I appreciate you taking the time.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.398
Gave me an excuse
to drive up the coast.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.068
Does she have a name?

23:21.151 --> 23:24.112
I love my car, but it's just a car.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.238
And it's a him.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.120
You know, last time we met,

23:32.204 --> 23:34.790
you, uh, disarmed me
with your evasive tactics.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.041
I see what you did there.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.709
No, I've got to hand it to you.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.419
Makes me wonder
what else you got up your sleeve.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.088
No, really, I get it.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.714
Hard to resist.

23:42.839 --> 23:43.840
I assume I'm not the first.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.843
I think you are. It's fairly recent.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.097
Sorry. That can't be easy.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.933
That's not what
we came here to discuss.

23:55.519 --> 23:57.062
You're going about this all wrong.

23:57.145 --> 24:00.190
Panicking the public, not wise.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.110
Keep doing that,
things are going to get ugly real fast.

24:04.903 --> 24:06.404
Yeah, man! Come on!

24:12.786 --> 24:14.955
Let's go! You got it.

24:28.552 --> 24:29.803
Hey, hey! Back up!

24:30.595 --> 24:32.889
The winner! Yeah! The winner!

24:33.390 --> 24:34.599
That's right!

24:37.811 --> 24:39.855
All right, he's done.
Get him out of here.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.065
- Next man up. Let's go. Come on.
- Get out of here.

24:42.566 --> 24:43.650
Is he breathing?

24:47.821 --> 24:48.864
There.

24:50.699 --> 24:51.741
You good?

24:51.825 --> 24:53.535
I'm not the one who needs to be good.

24:54.619 --> 24:56.371
Richy's here. We can get started.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.129
Who's the unlucky sod then?

25:08.633 --> 25:09.676
What the hell are you doing?

25:10.719 --> 25:12.888
Shutting your stupid face up
once and for all.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.139
In position.

25:15.974 --> 25:17.017
Are you having a laugh?

25:26.359 --> 25:27.485
I thought we were mates.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.820
You thought wrong, you mug.

25:28.904 --> 25:30.030
All right.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.950
Oh, are there any rules I should
know about before we start?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.286
Nope.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.708
I thought we were having a laugh?

25:41.791 --> 25:43.084
I wasn't laughing!

25:43.710 --> 25:45.378
Not even on the inside?

25:54.888 --> 25:57.682
Hey. Let me get you a drink.

25:57.766 --> 26:00.018
I'm not thirsty.

26:02.270 --> 26:05.440
Let's try that again. A drink?

26:06.107 --> 26:07.317
And again.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.526
No.

26:12.447 --> 26:13.782
Come on.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.078
I promise you'll have a good time.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.295
Come on.

26:37.931 --> 26:41.101
So, who's first?

27:06.543 --> 27:09.212
How about I do you a favour
and not tell anyone

27:09.296 --> 27:13.300
that a tiny, little Asian woman
kicked your ass?

27:15.218 --> 27:16.636
Are you not tired yet?

27:20.890 --> 27:23.560
'Cause that was sort of my strategy.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.068
Come on!

27:40.869 --> 27:42.704
Yeah! One more!

27:52.047 --> 27:53.965
Somebody going to call it?

27:54.049 --> 27:55.884
What's the point?
He's not breathing.

28:10.899 --> 28:14.944
You know, my agency
exists because yours imploded.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.112
But we came back,

28:16.196 --> 28:19.157
albeit with less real estate
and a lower profile.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.700
The low profile's the problem.

28:20.784 --> 28:22.619
No one knows you exist.

28:22.702 --> 28:25.663
But bizarre events keep happening
and people need to feel safe.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.709
So all these APBs on alien threats,
those are to help people feel safe?

28:30.585 --> 28:33.171
Look, the truth is, you don't understand
what you're dealing with.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.297
And you do?

28:34.381 --> 28:37.425
Which is why I'm asking you
to let my team bring Lincoln in.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.386
If we take him, it'll be easy.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.679
If you do it, people could get hurt.

28:41.763 --> 28:45.225
That might be the case, but I'm sorry.

28:45.308 --> 28:47.310
I can't agree to that.

28:59.823 --> 29:00.907
Coast is clear.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.706
It's me.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.258
You're having a hell of a day.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.971
I, um... I killed him.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.809
John. Um, he saved my life.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.853
More than once.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.856
And now...
I couldn't bring him back.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.402
Everything they're saying
about me is true.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.028
He's extremely dangerous.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.155
He won't be if he's in our custody.

29:40.238 --> 29:41.781
We're not gonna harvest him for parts,

29:41.865 --> 29:43.658
if that's what you're worried about.
We're not HYDRA.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.493
You say that now.

29:45.577 --> 29:46.786
What's so important about him?

29:46.870 --> 29:48.079
Are you serious?

29:48.163 --> 29:49.747
He can bring down a plane.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.374
Feels like a man worth talking to.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.876
I have another theory.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.294
The President makes a big speech

29:54.377 --> 29:56.754
about this new organisation
he's put in place.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.382
I imagine that puts
a lot of pressure on you.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.759
Pressure to show results.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.012
You're not wrong.

30:04.095 --> 30:05.555
And that's why I'm taking him in.

30:07.474 --> 30:10.059
But why are we here, Phil?

30:10.143 --> 30:13.271
We're waiting
to watch the sunset together?

30:13.354 --> 30:16.524
'Cause if you didn't come here
to make a deal, then what do you want?

30:16.608 --> 30:17.650
You have an ace up your sleeve

30:17.734 --> 30:19.569
and I'm tired of waiting
for you to play it.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.529
Is that so?

30:22.155 --> 30:24.282
You have surveillance from the hospital,

30:24.365 --> 30:28.077
which means there's another picture
you chose not to put on TV.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.584
A pretty face.

30:35.668 --> 30:40.256
There's no name, no birth record,
no social attached to it.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.219
She's one of them.

30:44.302 --> 30:45.637
And she works for you, right?

30:47.889 --> 30:49.807
What do I need to do to keep this quiet?

30:51.559 --> 30:53.353
You know what I want.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.481
Fine, they're right.
You're dangerous. I'm dangerous.

30:56.564 --> 30:57.941
But that's not who you are. You...

30:58.024 --> 30:59.651
You're wrong.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.152
I know the real you, Lincoln...

31:01.236 --> 31:02.654
- You don't.
- And you...

31:04.906 --> 31:07.283
The man who killed his only friend,

31:07.367 --> 31:10.161
who had to be saved from himself
over and over,

31:10.870 --> 31:12.372
that's the real me.

31:12.455 --> 31:13.748
That's who I really am.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.084
Not when I met you.

31:17.335 --> 31:20.630
You gave me hope,
a place in the world.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.883
Look what happened to it.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.135
You know better than anyone that

31:26.219 --> 31:28.346
if everything around you crumbles,
then you're the cause.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.474
Stop! You don't see it, but I do.

31:31.558 --> 31:35.061
You... You help people
because you are meant to.

31:36.563 --> 31:38.022
You can do that with us,

31:38.106 --> 31:40.900
like you were doing at the hospital,
saving lives.

31:40.984 --> 31:42.527
That part of my life is over.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.196
No, you...

31:45.280 --> 31:47.115
You are not cursed.

31:47.198 --> 31:50.702
You are not some horrible thing.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.203
I know,

31:54.497 --> 31:56.749
because you taught me that I wasn't.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.462
You convinced me that I had a purpose.

32:01.546 --> 32:04.382
That maybe my life wasn't over,
but just...

32:06.134 --> 32:07.343
Getting somewhere.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.141
Please let me do the same for you.

32:13.808 --> 32:16.436
You're wasting your time
caring about me.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.522
I can't help it.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.290
I'll go in with you.

32:37.373 --> 32:40.293
I'm not agreeing to work
with S.H.I.E.L.D. but with you.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.629
We'll figure it out together.

32:46.341 --> 32:49.010
Great.
Is the escape module on its way?

32:49.093 --> 32:50.637
Change of plans.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.566
Coulson's orders.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.277
We're turning him over to the ATCU.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.619
Get Coulson on the phone.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.037
He said he'd explain
back at headquarters.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.330
Daisy, what's happening?

33:17.413 --> 33:19.165
Coulson told me to let you know
that you're gonna be safe.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.291
He's arranged for us to observe

33:20.375 --> 33:21.584
- and make sure that...
- Can we get on with this?

33:21.668 --> 33:22.752
This is crazy.

33:22.835 --> 33:23.878
He said he didn't have a choice.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.463
Take him into custody.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.973
Suspect's on the move,
seal off the streets.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.350
<i>Awaiting orders.</i>

33:37.433 --> 33:39.519
- Should we go after him?
- No.

33:40.561 --> 33:43.231
Bird in the hand. We take her.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.817
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

33:45.900 --> 33:47.068
Following orders.

33:47.151 --> 33:48.444
Do you really think you can stop me?

33:48.528 --> 33:50.279
Do you have any idea what I can do?

33:50.363 --> 33:51.447
Yeah.

33:51.531 --> 33:54.158
That's why I have three snipers outside,
ready to engage.

33:54.242 --> 33:56.661
What's the range
on these powers of yours?

33:56.744 --> 33:57.787
How good are they?

34:00.456 --> 34:02.041
I'd say pretty damn good.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.835
Tell your men to stand down.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.378
I can't do that.

34:05.461 --> 34:07.088
He got away,
and I've made assurances.

34:07.171 --> 34:09.716
I assure you that if you insist
on taking my agent in,

34:09.799 --> 34:11.007
you will start a war.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.052
I will devote all the resources
and manpower of S.H.I.E.L.D.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.178
to crushing your agency.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.222
It's not personal, it's work.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.181
And right now, I need to show results.

34:18.266 --> 34:20.268
What if I offer something better?

34:24.731 --> 34:26.274
Copy that.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.735
I guess it's your lucky day.

34:29.819 --> 34:31.404
We're done.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.364
Let's go.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.956
I thought it'd be good for you
to get out somewhere nice.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.002
And quiet.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.590
Where is everyone?

34:50.672 --> 34:53.301
Well, I made sure
you wouldn't have any distractions.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.719
Mr Fitz, we're delighted to see you.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.597
Your table is this way.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.233
The wine is a gift from us.

35:09.317 --> 35:11.235
Very persistent young man here.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.362
We've been holding this reservation
for months.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.906
I'm delighted you're finally here.

35:17.074 --> 35:18.284
You kept the reservation.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.953
Don't make a fuss. It's not a big deal.

35:23.623 --> 35:26.876
I remember when you took me out
after months in the hospital.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.961
It made me feel
like a human being again.

35:29.462 --> 35:32.048
- You complained the entire time.
- Well...

35:33.174 --> 35:35.551
Okay, a crabby human being.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.932
I can't thank you enough.

35:41.015 --> 35:43.392
Yeah, it's a nice restaurant, isn't it?

35:43.851 --> 35:45.269
Yeah.

35:45.353 --> 35:47.772
But for more than that.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.440
For finding me.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.110
What else was I going to do?

35:54.654 --> 35:56.113
I don't know what to say.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.950
You don't have to say anything.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.994
Have you decided
what you'll be having?

36:02.078 --> 36:05.498
Gosh, so much to choose from.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.919
Maybe this will help.

36:13.089 --> 36:15.091
Should I make a toast?

36:18.594 --> 36:19.929
What?

36:22.765 --> 36:24.183
Can you give us two minutes?

36:24.267 --> 36:25.351
Of course.

36:40.867 --> 36:43.536
I'm sorry.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.170
<i>Help me understand.</i>

36:53.713 --> 36:55.298
It was not an easy decision.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.049
To hand Lincoln over.

36:57.133 --> 36:58.467
I had to make a choice.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.429
So it was him or me.

37:01.512 --> 37:03.097
They have your picture, Daisy.

37:03.556 --> 37:04.891
So, why didn't they take me?

37:04.974 --> 37:07.351
Once Lincoln left, how did you
convince them not to take me in?

37:08.311 --> 37:10.104
I offered them something
just as valuable.

37:10.187 --> 37:11.480
- What?
- Me.

37:11.564 --> 37:12.815
My expertise.

37:13.608 --> 37:15.526
So, now we're working with them?

37:15.610 --> 37:18.946
I'm done fighting with people
over who gets to fight the real fight.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.115
It's a colossal waste
of time and resources.

37:21.198 --> 37:24.368
I went against Talbot, I went against
another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D.

37:24.452 --> 37:26.954
We know what we're doing, they don't.

37:27.038 --> 37:28.331
Hopefully, they can learn from us.

37:28.414 --> 37:32.293
It is hard to trust them
when they are hunting people like me.

37:32.376 --> 37:33.419
I never said I trust them.

37:33.502 --> 37:36.547
Good. Don't, because we have no idea
what they're really after.

37:36.631 --> 37:37.673
Duly noted.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.091
Look.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.845
I understand
this is a personal matter for you.

37:43.346 --> 37:44.931
So Mack told you
what he heard me say?

37:45.014 --> 37:46.432
What would that be?

37:52.146 --> 37:53.648
It's Rosalind.

37:53.731 --> 37:54.941
First name basis, huh?

37:58.277 --> 37:59.445
I'll leave you to it.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.619
Well, I'm surprised
to hear from you so soon.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.705
<i>Just checking, making sure
you didn't give me a fake number.</i>

38:22.426 --> 38:24.261
You all right?

38:24.345 --> 38:25.680
I've been better.

38:28.099 --> 38:30.267
Thanks for not saying anything.

38:33.145 --> 38:36.607
You know,
I sure could use some backup.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.616
Let's see what
kind of skills you got, kid.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.243
All right.

39:02.133 --> 39:04.635
You certainly don't make it easy
to get a meeting.

39:04.719 --> 39:06.637
The boss doesn't want it to be easy.

39:07.847 --> 39:11.267
But he's always interested in meeting
people that can prove themselves.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.436
Sounds like an interesting bloke.

39:14.395 --> 39:17.314
I look forward to meeting him someday.

39:56.604 --> 39:57.646
Simmons?

40:02.693 --> 40:03.778
Why are you looking at that?

40:05.154 --> 40:06.238
Trying to understand.

40:06.322 --> 40:07.656
There's nothing to learn from this.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.409
It's possible it's not inert.

40:10.493 --> 40:12.912
Alien metals have different properties.
We don't know for sure.

40:12.995 --> 40:14.288
Yes, we do.

40:14.872 --> 40:15.915
You are safe.
