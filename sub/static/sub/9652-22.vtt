The blog is now water-resistant,
not waterproof.

19:28.048 --> 19:29.483
There is a difference.

19:29.516 --> 19:33.120
The buzz for next spring's
"tosh point show: on campus"

19:33.153 --> 19:34.354
is deafening.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.823
Everyone knows I'm a
huge fan of the u.

19:36.857 --> 19:40.093
Sadly "you" are out.

19:40.127 --> 19:41.995
You can blame my ballerina wife,

19:42.029 --> 19:45.966
who doesn't want to risk having
a tiny zika keychain baby.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.434
Michigan state, you're in.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.603
Also tickets are on sale

19:49.636 --> 19:51.814
for the sixth annual "tosh
saves the world charity show"

19:51.838 --> 19:53.073
in sarasota, Florida.

19:53.106 --> 19:54.908
Finally, listen up, kids.

19:54.942 --> 19:56.243
It's time for this week's

19:56.276 --> 19:58.378
"tips for not
getting kidnapped."

19:58.412 --> 19:59.813
- what do you have
on your hands?

19:59.846 --> 20:02.049
- zip ties in case you
ever get kidnapped,

20:02.082 --> 20:03.884
and not get these handcuffs

20:03.917 --> 20:06.386
'cause you can do
stuff with that.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.021
- so you untied your shoelace.

20:08.055 --> 20:10.090
- uh-huh.

20:10.123 --> 20:14.628
Take your other shoelace

20:14.661 --> 20:17.197
and tie them together.

20:22.469 --> 20:25.005
Once you have it... oops.

20:31.945 --> 20:33.080
Then you're free.

20:33.113 --> 20:35.549
- i think we all learned
a valuable lesson.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.784
For you children watching,
make sure you practice.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.186
And not in your living room.

20:39.219 --> 20:41.655
Lock yourself in the trunk
of your parent's hot car.

20:41.688 --> 20:44.191
Simulate game time situation.

20:44.224 --> 20:46.059
For the kidnappers watching,

20:46.093 --> 20:48.328
take your victim's shoelaces.

20:48.362 --> 20:50.364
It will also make it
much more difficult

20:50.397 --> 20:51.498
for them to run away.

20:51.531 --> 20:52.499
Good night!

20:52.532 --> 20:55.469
[cheers and applause]

21:01.441 --> 21:02.409
- what do you think
of the Kardashians?

21:02.442 --> 21:03.552
- Oh, i love Kim.
- You do love her?

21:03.576 --> 21:04.677
- yeah, i do.

21:04.711 --> 21:06.122
- what do you think
of her Booty though?

21:06.146 --> 21:07.113
It's fake. - she says it's real.

21:07.147 --> 21:08.214
- do you think it's real?

21:08.248 --> 21:09.558
- i don't know. I've
never touched it.

21:09.582 --> 21:10.726
- do you have to touch
it to know if it's fake?

21:10.750 --> 21:11.961
- i don't know. I'm
not a doctor either.

21:11.985 --> 21:13.229
- have you ever
touched a fake Booty?

21:13.253 --> 21:15.093
- no. i wouldn't know the
difference, probably.
