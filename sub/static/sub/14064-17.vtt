00:00.136 --> 00:01.307
<i>Previously on Boston Legal</i>

00:01.307 --> 00:02.262
Nice night.

00:02.297 --> 00:03.217
Suddenly it is.

00:03.218 --> 00:04.804
You had sex with her here?

00:04.839 --> 00:08.578
Hot, sweaty sex…

00:08.613 --> 00:10.335
in the coat check room.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.855
I'm not a one-woman man.

00:11.890 --> 00:13.341
As long as we're together,

00:13.341 --> 00:16.065
feel free to have sex
with anyone else you want.

00:16.065 --> 00:18.721
I care about what could happen
to this firm now!

00:18.721 --> 00:21.569
Let me tell you what will happen
to this firm if Denny Crane left.

00:21.569 --> 00:23.113
It would dry up and blow away
and you with it!

00:23.113 --> 00:24.854
By the way, did I tell you?

00:24.889 --> 00:27.410
Bev and I are getting married.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.931
No. I would have remembered that.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.688 --> 00:43.508
Alan, help me with my tie.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.154
Certainly.

00:45.927 --> 00:49.184
I can't do it this way. Turn around.

00:51.455 --> 00:54.882
Oh, I wish you and I
were getting married.

00:54.917 --> 00:56.963
That's you and I.

00:57.425 --> 01:00.376
Both of us, to others.
I'm not gay.

01:00.411 --> 01:04.132
I understood you the first Freudian slip.

01:04.168 --> 01:07.856
Well, I, I, I… I don't want to leave you.

01:07.891 --> 01:10.584
No doubt there will be some adjusting.

01:10.619 --> 01:13.725
But you're not losing an Alan,
you're gaining a Bev,

01:13.725 --> 01:16.309
the girl of your recent dreams.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.893
Alan, you're my best friend.

01:19.641 --> 01:22.172
If you want, you can dream
about her, too.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.300
Denny, you're generous to a fault.

01:26.614 --> 01:27.799
There you are.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.584
Denny Crane.

01:32.619 --> 01:34.645
Getting hitched.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.894
Indeed.

01:46.090 --> 01:49.353
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please rise

01:49.388 --> 01:53.337
and welcome for the first time
as husband and wife,

01:53.372 --> 01:57.252
Mr and Mrs Denny Crane.

02:13.683 --> 02:16.148
White roses, gold-leaf cake,

02:16.183 --> 02:18.828
Bev's boobs swimming
out of her wedding dress.

02:18.828 --> 02:21.002
Who said money
can't buy tastelessness?

02:21.002 --> 02:23.106
I think Bev and Denny
did a lovely job.

02:23.106 --> 02:26.648
11 marriages between the 2 of them.
They've had plenty of practice.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.544
Will you listen to you people?

02:28.579 --> 02:31.733
Can we not for just one moment
appreciate the simplicity

02:31.733 --> 02:36.149
and timelessness of two souls in love?

03:33.219 --> 03:37.814
Congratulations.  I saw you were
the lucky one who caught Bev's garter.

03:37.849 --> 03:42.410
Yes, I'm going for a full battery
of tests first thing in the morning.

03:42.445 --> 03:43.855
I love you.

03:44.274 --> 03:45.782
I love you more.

03:45.817 --> 03:47.126
I love you more more.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.922
Mainlander.

03:48.957 --> 03:50.683
Oh, my angel!

03:51.746 --> 03:53.776
Denny, this is my dear friend Troy.

03:53.776 --> 03:54.404
Troy.

03:54.405 --> 03:56.506
Denny, mahalo and congrats.

03:56.541 --> 03:56.875
Thank you.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.362
Troy lives on the big island.

03:58.362 --> 03:59.274
Oh, yeah?

03:59.275 --> 04:02.311
Well, we'll have to come and look you up
on our honeymoon

04:02.311 --> 04:03.037
if there's time.

04:03.037 --> 04:04.154
Oh, excellent, excellent.

04:04.154 --> 04:07.020
I've got some new listings
you two are going to fall for.

04:07.020 --> 04:10.679
Uh, Troy's a realtor.  He's been keeping
an eye out on houses for us.

04:10.679 --> 04:13.919
I didn't know we were in the market
for a second home.

04:14.135 --> 04:18.452
Actually, darling, when you see the Kona
coast, you may be thinking of first homes.

04:18.452 --> 04:22.172
What am I supposed to do, beam myself
to Boston every morning?

04:22.459 --> 04:26.926
Would you excuse us, Troy?
Hey, come here.

04:27.299 --> 04:31.786
Now, honey, I just want you
to humor me in my wild notions.

04:31.821 --> 04:34.564
I want to put this thought in your head,
and it's only a thought.  That's all.

04:34.564 --> 04:39.799
But now that we're starting
this new chapter in our lives,

04:39.834 --> 04:42.878
what do you say we really do it?

04:42.913 --> 04:44.260
Retire?

04:44.295 --> 04:48.859
No, that's an old person's word.
I'm talking about new beginnings.

04:48.894 --> 04:50.923
But, Bev, you know I'm the rainmaker
at the firm.

04:50.923 --> 04:54.965
Our clients want to know that Denny
Crane is taking care of their business.

04:54.965 --> 05:00.501
And Bev wants to know that
Denny Crane is taking care of…

05:00.536 --> 05:03.314
well, Denny Crane.

05:03.349 --> 05:06.457
But we have lots of time
for these thoughts.

05:06.492 --> 05:12.776
Tonight's all fun and games, right?

05:18.631 --> 05:21.745
Hi. Nice night.

05:25.531 --> 05:28.013
Suddenly it is.

05:35.998 --> 05:38.564
Has anyone seen Denny?
It's time for our toast.

05:38.564 --> 05:42.044
Oh, last time I saw him was over
near the coat check room.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.966
Denny?

05:58.932 --> 06:02.045
Is it time to cut the cake?

06:13.753 --> 06:15.388
Of course, there is no pre-nup.

06:15.388 --> 06:16.954
Actually, Denny signed one.

06:16.954 --> 06:18.841
He just neglected to have Bev sign it.

06:18.841 --> 06:20.659
I thought it was a lovely reception.

06:20.659 --> 06:23.642
I never got to the cake.
It looked fantastic.  Any of you try it?

06:23.642 --> 06:25.884
It was supposed to be marble
with a little fudge…

06:25.884 --> 06:27.636
Shut up, just shut up!

06:27.671 --> 06:30.414
While you sit here prattling
about cake fillings,

06:30.414 --> 06:33.088
Bev has hired an army
of lawyers to gut this firm.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.353
She won't get far, Paul.
It's a straightforward annulment.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.753
They were only married for three hours.

06:36.753 --> 06:40.284
Legally, they never had the opportunity
to consummate the marriage
after the ceremony.

06:40.284 --> 06:42.161
Oh, yes, we did.

06:42.989 --> 06:44.944
You had sex with another woman

06:44.979 --> 06:47.803
and your wife in the three hours
you were married?

06:47.803 --> 06:50.558
It was my special day.
I'd taken my little blue pill.

06:50.558 --> 06:54.123
There's no cure for cancer,
but we've got three pills for that.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.487
Look, there are other criteria
for an annulment.

06:56.487 --> 06:59.002
Legally, we can always say that
Denny was not of sound mind.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.108
That cannot become public knowledge,

07:02.143 --> 07:05.383
despite the repeated shootings,
the television appearances,

07:05.383 --> 07:07.858
people still believe Denny runs this firm.

07:07.858 --> 07:09.279
I am one of those people.

07:09.279 --> 07:12.961
Bev's attorney Eli Granger will be
here in less than an hour.

07:12.996 --> 07:17.904
My suggestion for now is that
we simply hear him out.

07:26.391 --> 07:28.125
Alan, it's awful.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.860
Joan? What's awful?

07:29.895 --> 07:31.265
My boss.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.985
Mr Loomis just fired me.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.329
I'm sorry.

07:34.364 --> 07:36.228
You work so hard, you know?

07:36.263 --> 07:38.676
Eight years at that frigging
escrow company.

07:38.676 --> 07:40.456
Why did he fire you?

07:40.491 --> 07:44.496
Well, one day six weeks ago,
he brings us all in for a staff meeting,

07:44.496 --> 07:48.466
and he says, “Due to the spiraling costs
of health care insurance,”

07:48.466 --> 07:50.873
“all smokers have exactly six weeks to quit,”

07:50.873 --> 07:53.614
“at which point I'll test their system
for nicotine,”

07:53.614 --> 07:56.806
“and if you fail the urine test,
then you'll be terminated”.

07:56.806 --> 08:00.145
Fired. Frigging health Nazi.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.481
You know, I got rent to pay,
and of course, I tried to quit.

08:03.481 --> 08:06.113
You know, I wanted to.
I did the patch,

08:06.148 --> 08:09.870
and I did that little nicotine
sucky thing, you know?

08:09.905 --> 08:12.502
But the more I imagined losing my job,

08:12.537 --> 08:14.759
the more I panicked,
and the more I panicked,

08:14.759 --> 08:16.424
the more I smoked.

08:16.459 --> 08:18.423
Now I'm up to three packs a day.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.179
And today was the day.

08:20.214 --> 08:22.592
He just made me pee in a cup,
and then he fired me.

08:22.592 --> 08:24.961
Well, unless that's some type
of sex game with your lover,

08:24.961 --> 08:27.297
I find that appalling,
and we won't let him do it.

08:27.297 --> 08:28.087
We won't?

08:28.122 --> 08:29.443
I'm off to court right now.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.655
But what floor is your office on?
I'll pay him a visit.

08:31.655 --> 08:36.245
The tenth.  Just follow the evil stench
of vitamins and celery.

08:48.675 --> 08:50.289
Ah, well, good morning, everyone.

08:50.289 --> 08:55.207
Shirley, I can see I didn't bring enough
silent flunkies to fill my side of the table.

08:55.207 --> 08:59.395
Double-shot espresso, skim milk,
two sugars. Scoot.

09:00.156 --> 09:01.556
Let's start over.

09:01.591 --> 09:06.267
Eli, welcome to Crane, Poole & Schmidt.
That's my seat.  Get out.

09:06.302 --> 09:11.682
Please get Mr Granger a cup of coffee,
skim milk, two sugars.  Thank you.

09:11.717 --> 09:17.062
Now, Eli, besides telling you your fake
tan is coming off on your collar,

09:17.097 --> 09:19.495
what can we do for you?

09:19.530 --> 09:21.593
The parting of ways, marital dissolution.

09:21.593 --> 09:26.031
My client's trauma is incalculable,
and yet look at me.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.298
I've calculated it.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.833
To the point.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.612
Mrs Crane gave up her career,

09:30.647 --> 09:33.422
a lucrative office furniture business,
to be a stay-at-home wife.

09:33.422 --> 09:35.797
She made irrevocable sacrifices,

09:35.832 --> 09:40.509
and still, as a generous offer,
considering her pain,

09:40.544 --> 09:44.549
she is willing to take only 50%
of Mr Crane's assets.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.209
What?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.464
Including his equity
in the firm here, of course.

09:47.464 --> 09:48.861
They were married only three hours.

09:48.861 --> 09:50.189
And it would have lasted longer,

09:50.189 --> 09:54.284
had Denny here not banged a cocktail
waitress at his own wedding reception.

09:54.284 --> 09:56.091
We're not here to judge.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.160
Though the state of Massachusetts is,
and in cases like this,

09:59.160 --> 10:03.460
we are a “fault” state,
and clearly Denny is at fault.

10:03.495 --> 10:07.760
And by the time Mrs Crane gets
what's hers, who knows?

10:07.795 --> 10:10.479
Maybe I'll have my name
on the door here.

10:10.514 --> 10:12.105
Do you smoke it
or take it in the arm?

10:12.105 --> 10:13.369
Brad.

10:15.118 --> 10:16.940
There will be no divorce.

10:16.975 --> 10:19.313
Beg pardon?

10:19.399 --> 10:22.788
Bev and I had an agreement.
When we first got together,

10:22.823 --> 10:26.143
she told me that I could sleep
with whomever I want.

10:26.178 --> 10:30.957
Delmonico's restaurant, January 14th.
Happiest night of my life.

10:30.992 --> 10:33.487
So I had sex with another woman

10:33.522 --> 10:36.272
or a navy burberry.

10:36.307 --> 10:38.236
I'm not quite sure which,
but the point is,

10:38.236 --> 10:44.008
she granted me the right to tomcat,
and I exercised that right.

10:44.425 --> 10:46.287
No divorce.

10:46.782 --> 10:49.511
No reconciliation.

10:50.574 --> 10:52.972
We're going to court.

11:02.651 --> 11:06.232
Every good marriage takes work.

11:19.236 --> 11:20.442
Kurt Loomis.

11:20.477 --> 11:24.482
Alan Shore.  I've noticed you
at the juice bar on the first floor.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.471
You always leave a penny,
never take one. I admire that.

11:28.506 --> 11:29.917
Ha, thank you, Al.

11:29.952 --> 11:32.234
So I guess you're here
to speak about Joan.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.896
Yes, Kur, I am.

11:33.931 --> 11:36.640
Well, I'm sorry to see her go,
but rules are the rules.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.642
You break them,
you've got to pay the price.

11:38.642 --> 11:43.806
I've never heard our entire system
of justice encapsulated so succinctly.

11:43.841 --> 11:46.067
Well, that's me.

11:46.102 --> 11:50.797
However, instances arise where
the rules themselves are unfair.

11:50.832 --> 11:52.634
This is one of those cases.

11:52.669 --> 11:53.557
Nope.

11:53.558 --> 11:56.105
The no-smoking rule is as right as the Bible.

11:56.105 --> 11:58.618
Good for the company,
good for the employees.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.346
It's just good, period.

12:00.381 --> 12:03.623
Well, and this may be
in the Bible somewhere,

12:03.658 --> 12:07.918
you do have the right to forbid
your employees from smoking at work,

12:07.953 --> 12:11.253
but why do you think you're justified
in telling anyone

12:11.278 --> 12:14.449
what they may or may not do
on their own time?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.656
Because it's good for them,

12:16.691 --> 12:19.839
and my lawyer told me I could,
guy just like you.

12:19.874 --> 12:23.651
You see, everyone here is what you call
an at-will employee.

12:23.686 --> 12:25.659
And like most workers in this country,

12:25.659 --> 12:29.537
they can be fired for anything,

12:29.572 --> 12:33.416
anytime, any place, any way.

12:33.451 --> 12:35.993
You see, Al, I used to coach football.

12:36.028 --> 12:37.553
I never would have guessed.

12:37.553 --> 12:39.795
It's like I used to tell my players.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.038
There are two ways to do things,

12:42.073 --> 12:43.982
my way and the wrong way.

12:44.017 --> 12:46.167
Joan did things the wrong way,

12:46.202 --> 12:48.283
so I cut her from the squad.

12:48.318 --> 12:52.088
I have a similar bit of wisdom
I like to share.

12:52.123 --> 12:55.969
We can do this my way or another way

12:56.004 --> 13:00.396
that will have you writing a very
large check and crying like a baby.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.213
Are you threatening me, Al?

13:02.248 --> 13:08.101
Why not just rehire Joan
and forget we ever met?

13:08.136 --> 13:10.874
I know I'd like nothing more.

13:10.909 --> 13:13.577
Nope, I think we're done.

13:13.612 --> 13:17.917
Actually, this is just the beginning
of our little game.

13:17.952 --> 13:22.222
I'd assumed that as a coach,
you'd have figured that out.

13:37.585 --> 13:39.367
Trying to quit?

13:39.962 --> 13:41.875
Not really.

13:41.910 --> 13:45.870
I just suppose there should be
a law requiring me to try to quit.

13:47.179 --> 13:49.186
What are you in for?

13:49.221 --> 13:49.999
Divorce.

13:50.034 --> 13:51.742
Ah, been there.

13:51.777 --> 13:56.644
Not with a husband. Boyfriend
after frigging boyfriend.

13:56.679 --> 13:58.609
I suck at relationships.

13:58.644 --> 14:01.228
Actually, I suck at almost everything.

14:01.263 --> 14:03.812
When I'm not inhaling,
I'm sucking.

14:03.847 --> 14:06.111
The story of my life.

14:06.409 --> 14:08.818
The only thing I've actually ever
been good at is my job,

14:08.818 --> 14:14.162
which I never sucked at but got fired
just the same for inhaling.

14:14.197 --> 14:15.545
I was good at it.

14:15.580 --> 14:19.111
I was good. I was good.

14:19.146 --> 14:20.894
I was…

14:20.929 --> 14:22.643
Good.

14:23.576 --> 14:25.381
I can't make my rent.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.593
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:27.628 --> 14:29.348
No, I do.

14:29.383 --> 14:32.430
Actually, I'm suing. That's it.
And I'm gonna win.

14:32.465 --> 14:35.260
Alan Shore's my lawyer, and he's good.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.549
He's good.

14:39.105 --> 14:40.573
Who have you got?

14:40.608 --> 14:43.727
Uh, I had Denny Crane.

14:43.762 --> 14:46.919
Now I've got Eli.

14:48.691 --> 14:51.290
Alan Shore's in my boss' office
right now trying to settle.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.855
He's going to come walking off
that elevator any second

14:53.855 --> 14:56.510
and tell me I've got my job back,

14:56.545 --> 14:58.881
or they're giving me money,

14:59.476 --> 15:02.548
or I'm gonna get everything I want.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.746
Otherwise…

15:07.080 --> 15:09.919
I have to win this.

15:09.954 --> 15:12.315
I have to win.

15:19.983 --> 15:21.626
We're being audited.

15:21.661 --> 15:23.235
The entire firm?

15:23.270 --> 15:25.055
To determine Denny's net worth.

15:25.055 --> 15:26.771
Let them. We have nothing to hide.

15:26.771 --> 15:30.436
Hold on a second there,
aunt Sally. This could be…

15:30.471 --> 15:32.138
well, a problem.

15:32.173 --> 15:33.351
Why?

15:33.352 --> 15:36.163
Denny, what have you done?

15:36.198 --> 15:38.571
Little things.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.910
How little?

15:40.945 --> 15:43.513
I may have, on occasion,

15:43.548 --> 15:47.595
laid off an occasional personal expense
on the firm, occasionally.

15:47.630 --> 15:48.851
Good Lord!

15:48.886 --> 15:52.788
Call Joel Landson in accounting.
Get him up here right away.

15:55.727 --> 15:58.190
Mind you, it's not exactly illegal,
but it's not legal either.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.967
It's in the fuzzy gray area.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.342
Denny's home address.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.392
Bottom line.

16:02.427 --> 16:03.760
Should this information become public…

16:03.760 --> 16:07.132
And we can be sure that
Bev's lawyers will see that it does.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.470
The IRS could get involved.
Our reputation will be sullied.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.653
Clients will begin to wonder
if they've been bilked.

16:12.653 --> 16:14.986
There could be more investigations,

16:15.021 --> 16:17.354
and all of the partners will be liable.

16:17.354 --> 16:19.458
We're talking Arthur Andersen headlines.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.236
We're screwed.

16:20.236 --> 16:21.116
We don't own enough shredders.

16:21.116 --> 16:24.534
Our only chance right now is
to settle and settle quickly.

16:24.534 --> 16:26.353
Um, we can't do that.

16:26.388 --> 16:27.839
Why not?

16:27.874 --> 16:29.290
Because…

16:29.501 --> 16:31.754
I want to stay married.

16:31.789 --> 16:32.982
I thought you were bluffing!

16:32.982 --> 16:34.923
That doesn't seem to be an option
right now, Denny.

16:34.923 --> 16:36.443
I'm gonna make it an option,

16:36.443 --> 16:41.046
and as we know,
my name on the door.

16:43.738 --> 16:45.822
That's it!

16:54.755 --> 16:55.582
Paul.

16:55.617 --> 16:58.350
Denise, I want you to look over
the partnership agreement

16:58.350 --> 17:00.081
and tell me hypothetically

17:00.116 --> 17:05.319
what would be required for me to sell
my portion out and take early retirement,

17:05.355 --> 17:08.657
and, hypothetically,
I would need that very fast.

17:08.693 --> 17:11.324
Paul, don't do anything
you'll regret.

17:11.358 --> 17:13.921
Doing nothing is what I'll regret most.

17:13.955 --> 17:18.252
I have devoted my life to keeping
this firm an outstanding institution.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.584
Now in the twilight of my career,

17:20.618 --> 17:24.218
this, this mess could destroy
my reputation,

17:24.252 --> 17:27.818
all because Denny
cannot control his aged groin.

17:27.853 --> 17:29.698
All right, listen, guys. I can fix this.

17:29.698 --> 17:32.260
Now just let me talk to Denny.
I know what to say.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.376
I can make him settle.

17:33.376 --> 17:38.548
Paul, just wait this out, please.

17:44.573 --> 17:47.455
The purchase of a home is one
of life's great stressors,

17:47.455 --> 17:50.319
and while I'm no braggart,
in my eight years at Loomis escrow,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.512
I had the most escrow closes.

17:52.547 --> 17:55.342
I had the highest customer satisfaction record.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.899
All of my year-end reviews were fours.

17:57.934 --> 18:00.555
That's out of a possible four.

18:00.590 --> 18:03.052
I was employee of the year
three years running.

18:03.052 --> 18:04.589
I mean, if I was such a bad worker,

18:04.589 --> 18:07.920
then why was I awarded the $100 gift
certificate to the Hungry Whistler?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.316
Your honor, at this time,

18:09.316 --> 18:15.498
if I may enter into evidence Ms Zeder's
three employee of the year plaques.

18:15.533 --> 18:19.800
Please note the inscribed nickname,
“Just ask Joan”.

18:19.835 --> 18:22.263
Thank you. I can see that.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.374
Now, Joan, do you smoke cigarettes?

18:25.409 --> 18:26.612
Yeah.

18:26.613 --> 18:28.114
Have you ever smoked at work?

18:28.114 --> 18:30.529
Yes, but only on my breaks on my time,

18:30.564 --> 18:33.859
away from the door,
and I'm a courtesy waver,

18:33.894 --> 18:37.173
so, you know, I… not in anyone's face.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.722
Does your smoking impact
your job in any way?

18:39.722 --> 18:42.166
No, and I've never been late
because of smoking.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.527
In fact, actually, it helps calm me down
so I can focus on my work.

18:45.527 --> 18:47.593
Thank you, Ms Zeder.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.715
Ms Zeder, did your boss tell you
to quit smoking, or you'd be fired?

18:56.750 --> 18:58.274
Yes.

18:59.233 --> 19:01.575
Nothing further.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.658
Denny.

19:13.665 --> 19:17.404
I was a marine. I served my country
proudly in the first Gulf war.

19:17.404 --> 19:21.313
I am an honest, honorable person.
I want you to know that I do not lie.

19:21.313 --> 19:21.971
We're clear on that?

19:21.971 --> 19:23.184
Yes.

19:24.225 --> 19:26.923
Are there any guns in here?
I want to be clear on that as well.

19:26.923 --> 19:28.005
There are many guns.

19:28.005 --> 19:28.794
Within reach?

19:28.829 --> 19:29.773
No.

19:30.492 --> 19:32.044
All right.

19:35.031 --> 19:39.286
Several weeks ago I took
your fiancée out to lunch.

19:39.321 --> 19:41.072
It's not that.

19:41.107 --> 19:43.860
I offered her $500,000

19:43.895 --> 19:46.363
to end her relationship with you.

19:46.398 --> 19:47.154
What?

19:47.189 --> 19:49.428
I know. It was a foolish thing to do,

19:49.429 --> 19:54.306
but I felt that I was acting in
the best interests of the firm and you.

19:54.341 --> 19:55.143
She turned you down.

19:55.143 --> 19:55.885
Yes.

19:57.673 --> 20:01.421
But before she did, she hesitated.

20:01.456 --> 20:03.945
She considered it.

20:03.980 --> 20:06.920
And it's my belief that
if I had offered her more,

20:06.920 --> 20:09.433
she would have taken it.

20:09.468 --> 20:13.229
Thank you, Brad, for telling me that.
It couldn't have been easy.

20:13.229 --> 20:14.856
You're fired.

20:15.303 --> 20:16.092
What?

20:16.127 --> 20:17.827
Name on the door.

20:18.599 --> 20:20.997
See you.

20:31.539 --> 20:33.939
He fired me. I'm a partner.
He fired me.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.926
Brad, the review committee
will take care of this.

20:36.926 --> 20:39.248
He can't just fire you without
consulting the partners.

20:39.248 --> 20:41.390
Of course he can. He's Denny Crane.

20:41.425 --> 20:45.219
His name's on the door.
If he wants me gone, I'm gone.

20:51.894 --> 20:54.727
Damn it, Denny, you just can't.

20:54.762 --> 20:55.283
Can.

20:55.284 --> 20:57.268
All of it. This is a law firm!

20:57.303 --> 21:00.370
This is a living, breathing entity.

21:00.405 --> 21:01.612
Yes, you may have founded it,

21:01.612 --> 21:04.957
but hundreds and hundreds of people
now have their lives attached to it,

21:04.957 --> 21:08.303
and at this moment,
through the choices you make,

21:08.338 --> 21:11.246
you have the potential
to unravel this entire place

21:11.246 --> 21:14.120
and the individuals who have given
everything to it.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.054
That may be, but still…

21:16.089 --> 21:18.000
So help me, if you say it's still
your name on the door,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.611
I will shoot you with one
of your own guns.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.137
That won't change the door.

21:22.172 --> 21:27.335
Denny, you cheated on your wife
at your own wedding reception

21:27.370 --> 21:29.640
in what has become some
sort of cloakroom fetish

21:29.640 --> 21:32.172
that is a new low even for you.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.592
Yeah.

21:35.050 --> 21:37.814
It is, isn't it?

21:39.738 --> 21:44.929
And now you're saying you don't want
the marriage to end?

21:44.964 --> 21:47.694
What is going on here?

21:49.219 --> 21:52.158
You've known me 30 years.
You tell me.

21:52.193 --> 21:54.875
One moment I'm enjoying
my own wedding reception,

21:54.875 --> 21:57.523
and the next, my gut's telling me
something's wrong.

21:57.523 --> 22:00.853
And somehow having sex
with that waitress

22:00.888 --> 22:04.184
or the coat made everything feel right.

22:04.219 --> 22:10.166
And once things felt right again,

22:10.201 --> 22:12.761
I wanted Bev back.

22:15.045 --> 22:17.210
Denny, your once charming

22:17.245 --> 22:23.015
and eccentric behavior has turned into
a series of self-destructive impulses.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.947
I love you, but

22:24.982 --> 22:28.262
it's time to take a step back
and look at what you're turning into.

22:28.262 --> 22:32.715
Shirley, I love you, too.

22:48.622 --> 22:50.518
Shirley, you want something.

22:50.553 --> 22:52.985
I'll guess it's sex.
Let me take my coat off.

22:52.985 --> 22:54.307
As much as I'd love to, Alan,

22:54.307 --> 22:57.050
if we did, I wouldn't have time
to deal with your needs.

22:57.050 --> 22:59.384
Yes. Well, another time.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.684
What's on your mind?

23:01.719 --> 23:04.686
I am sure you know
what's going on with Denny.

23:04.721 --> 23:07.399
Shirley, in this case, I've decided
to stay above the fray

23:07.399 --> 23:10.273
and catch the show
from the mezzanine.

23:10.308 --> 23:12.074
In case you missed the first act,

23:12.074 --> 23:14.816
Denny's decision
not to settle on his divorce

23:14.851 --> 23:17.156
leaves the firm quite vulnerable.

23:17.191 --> 23:21.049
We may be open to public audit,
uh, potential lawsuits,

23:21.084 --> 23:22.645
Paul has threatened to leave,

23:22.645 --> 23:25.085
and we may lose Brad
if we're not careful.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.936
Sounds exciting.

23:26.971 --> 23:30.098
So you want me to convince
Denny to settle

23:30.133 --> 23:32.733
so that we all may be settled?

23:32.768 --> 23:33.880
Something like that.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.303
I won't do it.

23:36.362 --> 23:39.122
Alan, you're willing to see
this firm go down?

23:39.148 --> 23:44.073
You're asking me to manipulate
my friend, and I won't do it.

23:44.108 --> 23:47.874
It would have been easier
just to have sex with you.

23:55.863 --> 23:57.996
Health insurance premiums keep going up.

23:57.996 --> 23:59.491
I run a small business.

23:59.526 --> 24:02.857
I'm competing against escrow services
that are nationwide chains

24:02.857 --> 24:04.550
and others that are on the internet.

24:04.550 --> 24:07.999
I have to either cut costs or close
my doors. It's that simple.

24:07.999 --> 24:10.575
And if Ms Zeder would have been
able to quit smoking,

24:10.575 --> 24:12.025
would you have kept her on the payroll?

24:12.025 --> 24:13.081
Of course.

24:13.082 --> 24:17.260
We didn't give her the $100 gift certificate
to the Hungry Whistler for nothing.

24:17.260 --> 24:22.325
Mr Loomis, your desire to cut costs
makes absolute sense,

24:22.360 --> 24:25.732
but we heard
your office manager testify

24:25.767 --> 24:29.268
that when you weigh
Ms Zeder's productivity

24:29.303 --> 24:32.769
against any increased
health insurance premiums,

24:32.804 --> 24:34.116
you still come out ahead.

24:34.116 --> 24:37.863
So your argument is, dare I say it,
a fumble, correct?

24:37.898 --> 24:39.639
I have to think of the future.

24:39.639 --> 24:41.907
If she gets cancer or heart disease

24:41.942 --> 24:46.035
or any of the other things that
smokers get, my rates go sky-high.

24:46.070 --> 24:48.097
Mr Loomis, how do you feel
about fat people?

24:48.097 --> 24:49.827
Because according to the Surgeon General,

24:49.827 --> 24:54.536
300,000 Americans die every year
from obesity-related illnesses.

24:54.571 --> 24:59.245
Other businesses are firing people
for that. I haven't done it yet.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.322
So you're thinking about it?

25:00.322 --> 25:01.561
I'm always thinking.

25:01.562 --> 25:03.774
Anyone can see that.
How about alcohol consumption?

25:03.774 --> 25:07.305
People who have more than 15 drinks
a week are at risk of becoming alcoholics,

25:07.305 --> 25:10.196
and alcoholism can cause cirrhosis
of the liver, pancreatitis,

25:10.196 --> 25:12.201
increased incidence of cancer.

25:12.236 --> 25:16.488
Wouldn't it be a good idea to monitor
your employees' alcohol intake?

25:16.523 --> 25:17.443
Maybe I should.

25:17.444 --> 25:18.377
Well, what about coffee?

25:18.377 --> 25:23.986
Caffeine temporarily increases
your blood pressure, trans-fatty acids
and stress.

25:24.021 --> 25:26.841
Both of these things
could cause heart attacks.

25:26.867 --> 25:29.679
That would certainly raise
your premiums sky-high.

25:29.679 --> 25:32.320
It's been proven
arguing 30 minutes a day

25:32.355 --> 25:34.941
lowers your immune system,
as does loneliness.

25:34.941 --> 25:37.418
There go your married employees
and your single ones.

25:37.418 --> 25:40.870
You're going to have to watch
these people all the time, Mr Loomis.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.382
I hope you're a multitasker.

25:42.382 --> 25:44.841
Mr Shore, I think you're exaggerating.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.301
No, I'm just welcoming us all to 1984.

25:47.336 --> 25:48.930
The bus arrived a little late,

25:48.930 --> 25:51.558
and our tour guide George Orwell
is good and dead,

25:51.558 --> 25:55.040
but nonetheless we made it,
and big brother Loomis is watching us.

25:55.040 --> 25:55.938
Objection.

25:55.973 --> 25:59.306
Nothing further, that is,
if it's okay with Mr Loomis.

26:13.101 --> 26:14.601
I, um…

26:17.106 --> 26:20.547
I drafted a memo for you regarding
the partnership agreement.

26:20.547 --> 26:21.932
Thank you.

26:21.967 --> 26:24.452
As a second topic,

26:24.487 --> 26:29.197
I'm not saying this firm is about
to dissolve, but if it did…

26:29.232 --> 26:30.054
Hypothetically.

26:30.054 --> 26:38.022
If it did, would you be interested
in breaking off and setting up
your own firm with someone?

26:38.057 --> 26:43.173
Someone & Bauer would probably be
the name on the door.

26:43.208 --> 26:49.204
Um, I would certainly have to think
about that, hypothetically.

26:49.239 --> 26:56.094
Well, that's all I could ask,
if I were asking.

26:59.922 --> 27:00.890
There you are.

27:00.925 --> 27:01.859
Here I am.

27:04.276 --> 27:05.278
How's your case?

27:05.313 --> 27:06.814
Not over.

27:06.934 --> 27:09.523
How are your various enterprises?

27:09.558 --> 27:11.548
You mean Bev.

27:11.583 --> 27:16.329
Everyone here thinks my situation
upstairs is clouding my judgment,

27:16.364 --> 27:19.548
that only an idiot would want
to stay with her.

27:19.583 --> 27:23.541
Everyone in love is something of an idiot.

27:27.028 --> 27:29.656
This might get ugly, Denny.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.521
It may have already.

27:32.556 --> 27:35.351
And I don't care.

27:36.203 --> 27:38.922
At a certain age, Alan,

27:38.957 --> 27:41.342
you'll find it extraordinary
the compromises

27:41.342 --> 27:46.198
one is willing to make for even
the possibility of love.

27:50.934 --> 27:55.452
Increased globalization,
megacorporations.

27:55.487 --> 27:57.856
How can a small businessman compete?

27:57.891 --> 28:00.191
Two ways. He must offer a unique,

28:00.226 --> 28:05.006
terrific product or service,
and he must keep costs down.

28:05.041 --> 28:08.097
Now Kurt Loomis runs
a first-rate escrow company,

28:08.132 --> 28:10.394
and he wants to do right
by his employees

28:10.394 --> 28:12.090
by offering them health insurance,

28:12.090 --> 28:16.090
but if he doesn't keep his biggest
expense in check, health care,

28:16.125 --> 28:17.430
he loses everything.

28:17.465 --> 28:21.726
So he instituted a very strict
no-smoking policy.

28:21.761 --> 28:26.012
Now Mr Loomis is not only reducing
his business costs,

28:26.047 --> 28:31.442
he's also helping his employees who smoke
by giving them motivation to quit.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.850
Now Joan Zeder knew the company policy.

28:33.885 --> 28:36.553
She was given ample time
to quit smoking,

28:36.588 --> 28:39.222
and she knew she'd be fired
if she didn't,

28:39.257 --> 28:43.111
but she chose cigarettes
over her job

28:43.146 --> 28:45.895
and because Ms Zeder is
an at-will employee,

28:45.930 --> 28:48.696
Mr Loomis had a legal right to fire her.

28:48.731 --> 28:52.362
And as to what smoking
is doing to her health,

28:52.397 --> 28:55.994
she can read the warning label
on the pack.

29:00.191 --> 29:03.866
The great Irish playwright
George Bernard Shaw

29:03.901 --> 29:07.507
had a rather jaundiced view
of our country.

29:07.542 --> 29:13.553
Shaw said that
while our Constitution was set up
to prevent political dictatorship,

29:13.588 --> 29:18.335
in doing so, we established a society
where every ward boss is a dictator,

29:18.370 --> 29:22.306
every financier a dictator,
every private employer a dictator,

29:22.341 --> 29:26.309
all with the livelihood
of the workers at their mercy.

29:26.344 --> 29:29.997
Well, if Mr Loomis wants
to emulate Mussolini

29:30.032 --> 29:33.812
in how he treats his employees
at the office, that's one thing,

29:33.818 --> 29:37.534
but Joan Zeder's actions at work
have always been commendable.

29:37.534 --> 29:41.952
Mr Loomis also declared himself emperor
over Ms Zeder in her home.

29:41.987 --> 29:46.371
There he found her smoking, something
which is not against the law,

29:46.406 --> 29:48.426
which is, in fact,
none of his business,

29:48.426 --> 29:50.115
but he fired her anyway.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.898
Shouldn't we be able
to have private lives

29:52.933 --> 29:55.300
that aren't governed
by the people we work for?

29:55.300 --> 30:01.989
My God, I cannot believe I just asked
that question in an American courtroom.

30:02.024 --> 30:04.844
My head may explode.

30:04.879 --> 30:07.999
Your honor, the right to privacy,

30:08.034 --> 30:12.616
as you well know, is guaranteed
under our Constitution,

30:12.651 --> 30:15.318
but now, thanks to our
current supreme court,

30:15.318 --> 30:18.388
that right is flickering
like a candle in the wind,

30:18.423 --> 30:20.582
and the breeze is picking up.

30:20.617 --> 30:24.376
But justice Scalia and his ilk
aren't judging this case.

30:24.411 --> 30:26.104
You are.

30:26.139 --> 30:29.961
And at what point
will we say, will you say,

30:29.996 --> 30:33.341
that provided we do not violate the law,

30:33.376 --> 30:39.654
other people cannot dictate what we do
in the privacy of our own homes?

30:40.585 --> 30:45.932
Your honor, when you consider this case
in the privacy of your chambers

30:45.967 --> 30:51.532
where no police or lawyers
or Loomis may enter,

30:51.567 --> 30:57.156
please think about the dying gasps
of our precious right to privacy

30:57.191 --> 31:02.997
and what our lives might be like
if it actually passes away.

31:38.929 --> 31:43.035
Conference room.
I'm putting this thing to bed.

31:53.729 --> 31:55.262
It's high.

31:55.297 --> 31:57.218
It could have been much higher.

31:57.253 --> 31:58.743
Denny, you want
to take a look at this?

31:58.743 --> 31:59.899
No need.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.409
Here's our counteroffer.
 Two words.

32:02.444 --> 32:04.599
Well, maybe three.

32:05.152 --> 32:08.031
“Barbara's built-ins.”

32:10.363 --> 32:12.417
Can Denny and I please have the room?

32:12.417 --> 32:13.690
Bev…

32:13.691 --> 32:17.775
It's all right. I've got it.

32:32.499 --> 32:33.816
So what do you know?

32:33.851 --> 32:37.471
“Barbara's built-ins, only the best”.

32:37.506 --> 32:42.028
You marketed to old people in retirement
homes in and around Boca raton.

32:42.063 --> 32:46.551
You sold built-ins for television sets
and built-ins for dishwashers,

32:46.586 --> 32:50.164
built-ins for microwaves,
but you never built them in.

32:50.199 --> 32:53.090
That's not true. I did some lovely work.

32:53.125 --> 32:57.297
I always meant to finish the jobs that
people had contracted me for, but I…

32:57.297 --> 33:01.435
I had a cash flow problem, and it made
more sense financially to just…

33:01.435 --> 33:04.761
To rob the geezers and skip town.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.170
How long have you known?

33:10.205 --> 33:11.787
Since our third date.

33:11.788 --> 33:15.254
Whenever I make love to a woman
more than twice, I have her investigated.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.951
But, Denny, since you knew my history,

33:17.986 --> 33:22.561
why, why didn't you have me
sign a pre-nup?

33:22.596 --> 33:24.649
Because I loved you.

33:25.606 --> 33:28.203
And when you can send someone
to jail with a phone call,

33:28.203 --> 33:29.729
there's your pre-nup.

33:29.764 --> 33:32.911
Well, you know,
I still could have you audited.

33:34.714 --> 33:37.151
Stalemate.

33:37.186 --> 33:39.553
Exactly.

33:39.588 --> 33:42.818
And you know why it's a stalemate?

33:42.853 --> 33:45.460
Because we're so much alike.

33:45.495 --> 33:50.448
The fact that we have something on each
other means we belong together.

33:50.483 --> 33:55.579
Our love is a fairy tale written
by real people.

33:55.614 --> 34:00.595
All I'm saying is, even after all this,

34:00.630 --> 34:05.475
I'd like to make it work.

34:07.816 --> 34:09.871
Denny…

34:11.139 --> 34:13.327
I love you.

34:14.545 --> 34:20.175
But I love Hawaii more.

34:25.177 --> 34:31.677
Well, you'll be the one that got
away from Denny Crane.

34:32.300 --> 34:35.908
Which that makes you, uh,

34:35.943 --> 34:42.958
a large fish in a very small pond.

34:46.533 --> 34:52.056
Mr Shore, I believe in the right to privacy
that you so passionately defended,

34:52.091 --> 34:55.898
and I believe that when Mr Loomis
fired Ms Zeder for actions

34:55.933 --> 34:59.453
that in no way affected
her performance at work,

34:59.488 --> 35:01.528
he acted unreasonably,

35:01.563 --> 35:03.534
but unfortunately,

35:03.569 --> 35:07.736
the law doesn't require Mr Loomis
to be reasonable.

35:07.771 --> 35:10.146
Therefore, there is nothing I can do.

35:10.181 --> 35:14.124
I am granting the motion to dismiss.
Court is adjourned.

35:16.312 --> 35:18.021
What?

35:18.056 --> 35:20.858
I'm sorry, Joan.

35:25.431 --> 35:29.172
We can always appeal this, Joan,
and in the meantime, find you a new job.

35:29.172 --> 35:30.475
New job?

35:30.510 --> 35:33.830
Alan, I'm a smoker,
an evil, villainous smoker.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.059
If I go on a job interview,

35:35.059 --> 35:38.603
and I'm honest.  I tell them I have
a 2-pack-a-day habit, that's it.

35:38.603 --> 35:40.764
Liability, leper.

35:40.799 --> 35:44.269
Yeah, no, this is a new world order, Alan.

35:44.304 --> 35:49.138
I am just a cog and, I've got
to find a way to fit in.

35:49.173 --> 35:53.972
I've got to find a way to quit,
even if it kills me.

35:58.622 --> 36:00.847
You know what I'm gonna
miss most about smoking?

36:00.847 --> 36:03.562
It's like, you work your ass off all day.
People screaming at you.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.881
“Where's my this? Where's my that?”

36:04.881 --> 36:08.528
“Why you haven't you answered my e-mail
that I sent you seven seconds ago?”

36:08.528 --> 36:11.492
And in all that chaos, all that frenzy,

36:11.527 --> 36:14.457
smoking was more than a habit. It was…

36:14.492 --> 36:16.732
it was a place to go

36:16.767 --> 36:19.442
where I could just shut out
the rest of the world

36:19.442 --> 36:27.190
and find a little square bit of time
and peace for me,

36:27.225 --> 36:30.142
just a little bit.

36:30.177 --> 36:33.024
That sounds perfect.

36:33.059 --> 36:37.992
If I may suggest an alternate habit,
intercourse.

36:38.027 --> 36:38.560
What?

36:38.595 --> 36:41.645
I find it just as relaxing,

36:41.646 --> 36:44.964
that break in the day
or several times

36:44.999 --> 36:48.282
when you shut the rest of the world out,

36:48.317 --> 36:50.263
breathing in the moment,

36:50.298 --> 36:52.576
feeling it run through your body,

36:52.611 --> 36:55.707
that nice high in the end,

36:55.742 --> 36:58.804
much like a cigarette.

36:59.891 --> 37:04.837
Was, uh, was that a proposition?

37:05.455 --> 37:07.634
Not really.

37:07.669 --> 37:10.042
But if, as a friend, you ever
need any assistance,

37:10.042 --> 37:16.333
whenever you feel like having
a smoke, just call me instead.

37:16.782 --> 37:18.782
Thanks, Alan.

37:19.348 --> 37:24.090
An agreement has been reached
on the matter of Crane vs Crane.

37:24.125 --> 37:29.280
I will buy a house for Bev
in Hawaii. She will accept.

37:29.315 --> 37:32.356
Marriage is dissolved.

37:34.356 --> 37:36.657
Mrs Crane, I think we should
consider our options…

37:36.657 --> 37:41.559
We're done, Eli. We're done.

37:43.351 --> 37:46.365
Look me up if you're ever
on the big island.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.205
I am the big island.

37:52.388 --> 37:54.153
Come on.

38:05.064 --> 38:06.444
Brad.

38:08.517 --> 38:11.071
I really couldn't have
fired you by myself.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.312
Yes, you could have.

38:12.347 --> 38:13.554
Yes, I could have.

38:13.555 --> 38:15.558
But sometimes people say things
they don't really mean,

38:15.558 --> 38:18.615
like “I love you” or “you're fired,”

38:18.650 --> 38:21.931
so I really want you
to stay with the firm.

38:21.966 --> 38:25.211
While everyone was whining about Bev,

38:25.246 --> 38:27.960
you actually tried to take her out.
I admire that.

38:27.960 --> 38:31.832
You have very large testicles,
my friend.

38:31.867 --> 38:35.748
Well, thank you, Denny. I'm flattered
you have that opinion of me.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.412
It's not my opinion.

38:37.447 --> 38:39.869
I saw you in the shower
at the gym.

38:39.904 --> 38:42.690
Good God!

39:13.690 --> 39:17.529
You know the best part of my marriages
has always been the first day.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.726
Just married, a grand thing.

39:20.761 --> 39:23.497
But for me there was nothing more

39:23.532 --> 39:28.611
devastatingly lonely than
being married for a while.

39:29.602 --> 39:32.813
You never talk about your wife.

39:33.431 --> 39:35.799
What was she like?

39:37.369 --> 39:41.776
She had all the most delectable
qualities one could hope for,

39:41.811 --> 39:46.862
creativity, desire, zealotry,

39:46.897 --> 39:49.466
a gorgeous clavicle,

39:49.501 --> 39:52.057
healthy lack of inhibition.

39:52.092 --> 39:55.676
Sounds spectacular. What happened?

39:55.938 --> 39:58.654
She began…

40:01.097 --> 40:05.547
to know me too well, and I began
to hate her for it.

40:05.582 --> 40:09.998
Even when I was unpredictable,
she'd predict it.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.817
For those of us who aspire
to be original,

40:12.852 --> 40:18.486
it's the worst sort of banality.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.483
She died.

40:25.160 --> 40:29.410
I've missed that banality
ever since.

40:37.799 --> 40:40.277
I wonder if sometimes I get remarried

40:40.312 --> 40:43.115
just to have someone listen
to my stories again.

40:43.115 --> 40:44.314
That's a terrible reason.

40:44.314 --> 40:48.493
Someone with that admiring look
in their eye.

40:49.645 --> 40:51.691
Yes.

40:59.525 --> 41:03.660
Denny, they're doing some sort
of renovations at my hotel.

41:03.695 --> 41:08.181
They start at dawn and make
a horrendous racket.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.959
It wakes me up.
I can't get back to sleep.

41:10.994 --> 41:13.974
It's always something with you.

41:14.009 --> 41:16.954
Night terrors, clowns, renovation.

41:17.396 --> 41:22.769
I was wondering if I could spend
the night at your place.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.570
How long is the renovation
gonna take?

41:26.570 --> 41:28.463
They won't say.

41:30.894 --> 41:32.938
Well…

41:35.541 --> 41:38.649
Stay as long as you need.

41:39.478 --> 41:41.310
