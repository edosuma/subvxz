00:59.917 --> 01:04.376
I often think back to that day
although it's been almost a year.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.334
But it would be hard not to.

01:07.501 --> 01:13.751
Because it was the day
my life turned upside down...

01:19.959 --> 01:21.501
Wake up!!

01:21.584 --> 01:25.876
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Lucas, stop it.

01:26.417 --> 01:30.334
One... two... three!

01:30.417 --> 01:33.417
- Let go!
- Come on, mum!

01:33.501 --> 01:38.292
No, five more minutes...
I've barely slept.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.084
Get up!

01:40.626 --> 01:42.542
- Lucas!
- Get up!

01:43.209 --> 01:45.667
- Let's go!
- You...

01:46.542 --> 01:48.084
Get up!

01:48.167 --> 01:52.584
See? You got up!
You got up! You're up!

01:52.667 --> 01:56.001
- I am now...
- See? Let's go!

01:56.084 --> 01:57.626
It's the holidays, mum!

01:59.167 --> 02:00.709
Be quiet!

02:00.792 --> 02:02.251
Wait...

02:04.626 --> 02:06.584
Good morning ms.
Jadzia, we're going.

02:07.167 --> 02:10.876
- Why so early?
- To avoid the traffic.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.417
- Goodbye!
- Ms Jadzia, could you water our...?

02:13.584 --> 02:15.542
- Yes, I'll water them.
- Thanks!

02:25.709 --> 02:27.126
And this.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.584
Little guy!
I've got something for you.

02:31.209 --> 02:33.876
- It's all junk food!
- Thanks!

02:33.959 --> 02:36.209
It's the holidays, right?

02:44.209 --> 02:46.709
BEHIND THE BLUE DOOR

02:53.584 --> 02:57.876
Turn. Right.
In two hundred. Meters.

02:57.959 --> 03:00.751
As. You. Wish. Madam.

03:10.876 --> 03:14.042
- Do you want to play a guessing game?
- Guessing game? Seriously?

03:14.126 --> 03:15.334
Seriously.

03:16.001 --> 03:19.542
- OK... I'll go first!
- Wait! Girls first.

03:19.626 --> 03:23.084
What is... long... flat...
and you can swim on it?

03:23.251 --> 03:24.876
- A kayak!
- No...

03:25.042 --> 03:27.459
- Canoe?
- Flat!

03:27.542 --> 03:29.376
- A dinghy!
- No.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.042
- A raft?
- Oh, I forgot. It has a sail.

03:33.126 --> 03:35.001
A board? Mum? Really?

03:35.084 --> 03:37.751
Yes, I bought you lessons.
Starting tomorrow.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.251
How cool!!!

04:08.834 --> 04:11.917
Lucaaaaas...

04:13.376 --> 04:16.500
Muuum...

05:50.042 --> 05:52.751
All right!

05:53.959 --> 05:56.709
It hurts...

06:00.001 --> 06:03.751
You need to be brave.
Your knee is crushed.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.709
You've been through
a complicated operation.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.626
Where's my mum?

06:10.626 --> 06:16.751
- We took her to another hospital.
- Why?

06:17.501 --> 06:22.584
Because you see...
Your mum is in a coma.

06:22.751 --> 06:24.626
What does that mean?

06:26.042 --> 06:31.542
It means she's fast asleep
and we don't know how to wake her up.

06:31.709 --> 06:36.209
I know how to.
I want to go and see her.

06:36.292 --> 06:39.334
You need to rest now.

07:02.542 --> 07:04.959
Come on...

07:06.126 --> 07:08.167
- Does it hurt?
- No.

07:08.251 --> 07:11.417
- Be honest.
- I am honest.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.626
One more time. Work it.

07:14.709 --> 07:22.084
Lucas, I know you want to leave.
But you can't speed it up.

07:22.667 --> 07:28.126
As soon as your mum wakes up,
we'll tell you.

07:36.709 --> 07:40.001
- Let's get some clothes from your flat.
- How come?

07:40.167 --> 07:43.709
Because...
you're going to be living with me.

07:43.876 --> 07:49.709
- But I've already got a home.
- But you can't live alone.

07:50.834 --> 07:55.667
Come on, dear.
You'll be fine with me.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.126
There you go.

08:13.751 --> 08:16.667
I can't really stand here.
This drive is for ambulances.

08:16.751 --> 08:19.126
One moment.

08:31.126 --> 08:33.626
- Ms. Cybulska?
- Yes?

08:33.792 --> 08:39.001
Can we go and see mum?
Please. I beg you.

08:50.626 --> 08:52.501
Can I go in?

09:04.542 --> 09:10.042
Mum... Get up, I want to go home.

09:18.376 --> 09:21.917
You do hear me, right?

09:24.126 --> 09:28.292
I'm sorry I didn't come for so long.

09:41.751 --> 09:44.084
Don't be silly.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.126
One, two...three!

09:56.042 --> 09:59.459
Your mum needs some peace now.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.334
Come on.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.709
Come on now.

10:49.084 --> 10:52.001
Ms. Cybulska?

12:35.876 --> 12:37.167
Lucas, is that you?

12:39.167 --> 12:40.959
I found this in the postbox.

12:42.001 --> 12:43.959
You shouldn't use the stairs
by yourself.

12:44.042 --> 12:51.251
I know... Maybe I could visit mum
tomorrow and read it to her.

12:52.084 --> 12:56.667
- It's from the bank.
- From the bank?

13:05.917 --> 13:06.917
What?

13:09.167 --> 13:15.084
It says they haven't received
their last payment.

13:19.126 --> 13:22.417
- If your mum doesn't wake up...
- She will.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.917
No, of course.
Yes, she will.

13:26.084 --> 13:28.917
- But...
- What?

13:29.001 --> 13:32.501
Are they going to take our home?

13:38.292 --> 13:39.501
They might...

13:40.084 --> 13:44.584
Mum is definitely going back to work.

13:45.459 --> 13:50.084
- I'll get it.
- No, I will. I need to exercise my leg.

13:55.042 --> 13:58.042
- Are you Lucas Borski?
- Yes.

13:59.334 --> 14:03.167
Good. Pack up. You're coming with me.

14:04.292 --> 14:09.167
Maggie, I mean Lucas mum
never told me that...

14:09.251 --> 14:11.959
I'm not going to explain
our family issues.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.084
Anyway, we're close family.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.417
Maybe it would be worth
getting in touch with...

14:23.917 --> 14:27.792
- Watch out!
- We're not that familiar.

14:28.084 --> 14:32.126
If you hadn't been eavesdropping
nothing would have happened.

14:32.209 --> 14:34.751
- Were you talking about me?
- Not only.

14:34.834 --> 14:36.709
Can you tell me what's going on here?

14:37.292 --> 14:41.834
Ms. Agata is your family.
Your aunt. Auntie.

14:42.001 --> 14:44.584
- What?
- I'm your mum's sister.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.501
I don't believe you.
Mum never told me she had a sister.

14:47.584 --> 14:50.584
- Maybe she didn't want to.
- Mum tells me everything.

14:50.667 --> 14:53.167
- Don't use that tone.
- She's an impostor!

14:53.334 --> 14:56.251
Listen, you brat!
This isn't much fun for me either.

14:56.417 --> 15:00.292
But if you're going to behave like this,
it'll be even harder! Got it?

15:00.459 --> 15:02.876
Why so nervous?

15:03.542 --> 15:05.667
Sorry.

15:05.834 --> 15:10.667
I've got something...
That might convince you.

15:12.167 --> 15:13.626
I need to sit down.

15:37.167 --> 15:44.376
- Mum wore braids?
- We both did. That was the fashion.

15:45.959 --> 15:48.584
Strange.

15:50.126 --> 15:52.584
I'm sorry I shouted...

15:54.376 --> 15:59.167
So am I.
I don't know how to deal with children.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.292
I'm not a child.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.917
- What's this?
- What?

16:17.001 --> 16:19.334
That?

16:21.667 --> 16:25.167
- That's High Cliff.
- Which is..?

16:25.334 --> 16:27.501
My Bed and Breakfast.

16:28.917 --> 16:32.459
- You'll see tomorrow.
- But I don't want to go!

16:32.626 --> 16:36.292
You didn't think
I'd be looking after you in Warsaw?

16:36.376 --> 16:39.626
I can't leave mum.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.209
I talked to the doctor...

16:44.501 --> 16:47.876
We're leaving tomorrow.

16:50.751 --> 16:52.959
Come on.

16:56.501 --> 16:59.501
It looks as if it devoured people.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.667
Hop in!

17:48.417 --> 17:51.209
Maybe you forgot
to put some coal in, auntie?

17:51.376 --> 17:55.209
Don't be silly.
This is a very good car. Old but gold.

17:55.792 --> 17:58.876
I've had it since nineteen...

18:01.042 --> 18:03.209
What a pershing...

18:05.459 --> 18:09.751
It might not be the fastest,
but it's good enough for me.

18:10.376 --> 18:13.334
- What for?
- Everything!

18:13.417 --> 18:17.834
You know...
I do everything alone.

18:18.001 --> 18:20.751
Sometimes
I have to pick the guests up too.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.459
When are we coming back?

18:30.501 --> 18:33.001
She needs me.

18:43.501 --> 18:45.459
We're almost there.

19:19.501 --> 19:22.001
Here we are.

19:40.626 --> 19:43.209
It should be open.

20:03.334 --> 20:07.626
Come on! Come.
I'll make you something to eat.

20:28.001 --> 20:31.376
Egg. Is that ok?

21:12.709 --> 21:15.376
Come on, come on.

21:19.417 --> 21:25.917
When the water boils, make yourself
some tea. I'll be back in a moment.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.834
Are you done?

21:38.917 --> 21:41.501
I've prepared
your mum's old room for you...

21:41.584 --> 21:43.459
Unfortunately,
it's on the first floor.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.084
It would be better
if you slept downstairs, in no.3.

21:46.167 --> 21:49.167
- I prefer my mum's room!
- The stairs are steep.

21:49.251 --> 21:51.167
I don't mind!
I want mum's room.

21:53.917 --> 21:56.501
Good. Come on then.

22:03.001 --> 22:07.084
Oh, High Cliff's most important rule:
always knock.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.667
Pardon?

22:08.751 --> 22:13.209
Always knock if you want
to come into a room.

22:15.917 --> 22:16.876
All right...

22:16.959 --> 22:19.626
Repeat after me.
It's very important.

22:19.792 --> 22:26.459
- Always knock. Why?
- For the guests' comfort.

22:33.292 --> 22:35.084
Here we are.

22:37.417 --> 22:38.876
Why are they blue?

22:39.042 --> 22:45.126
Your mum painted them.
She was always a bit crazy.

22:45.459 --> 22:48.167
- Nice. -
I don't know...

22:48.334 --> 22:50.542
I like them.

22:55.126 --> 22:59.917
Breakfast's at 8:30.
Don't be late. Good night.

23:00.084 --> 23:02.042
Good night...

24:40.792 --> 24:45.626
You have reached Maggie Borska.
Leave your message after the tone.

24:53.042 --> 24:58.001
You have reached Maggie Borska.
Leave your message after the tone.

25:32.376 --> 25:34.792
Hello.

25:35.292 --> 25:37.667
Why are you screaming?

25:37.959 --> 25:42.417
Your breakfast is in the kitchen.
The guests want to eat in peace.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.042
There you go.

26:22.709 --> 26:25.917
Do you need a special invitation?

27:04.334 --> 27:06.334
Hey, look!

27:12.084 --> 27:13.459
Out of the way!

27:15.376 --> 27:17.417
Oh dear, I'm bleeding.

27:20.959 --> 27:22.709
Hey, you.
Didn't you hear me coming?

27:23.376 --> 27:25.334
- I did.
- Why didn't you get out of the way?

27:25.959 --> 27:27.459
I thought you knew how to drive.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.417
You'd better learn how to walk.
Cripple!

27:29.501 --> 27:30.501
Whale!

27:30.667 --> 27:31.626
Lucas?!

27:32.209 --> 27:34.959
It's Crazy Agata! Let's get out of here!
I'll get you!

27:35.709 --> 27:39.209
Are you all right?
What did they want?

27:39.376 --> 27:42.751
Nothing.
I could have dealt with them myself.

27:51.501 --> 27:54.167
Lucas... Lucas...

27:54.251 --> 27:55.834
I don't want to be here.

27:56.001 --> 27:58.959
- Listen...
- I don't want to listen!

27:59.667 --> 28:03.876
- Don't talk like that.
- Leave me alone. I hate this place.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.292
Is this about the kids?

28:05.459 --> 28:09.334
It's about everything!
Including you. Take me back home.

28:10.709 --> 28:12.209
I can't.

28:16.917 --> 28:20.667
I've got something for you.
This belonged to your father...

28:20.834 --> 28:24.042
I don't want to hear about him!
Go away!

28:59.042 --> 29:04.042
You think I want this?
You think I know how to look after kids?

29:05.501 --> 29:09.292
- Was dad from here?
- No.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.584
He came to work during the holidays.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.751
He fell in love with your mum
and she fell in love with him.

29:15.917 --> 29:17.626
- And that was it.
- And?

29:17.709 --> 29:20.501
Your dad disappeared
the night before their wedding.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.501
- Disappeared?
- Just like that.

29:23.667 --> 29:26.251
It was a terrible night.

29:26.334 --> 29:28.084
There was a storm at sea.

29:28.167 --> 29:31.251
A fishing boat crashed
on the rocks in our bay.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.209
You could hear the shouts out here.

29:33.376 --> 29:35.959
- Did everyone die?
- No.

29:36.126 --> 29:40.376
Four of them swam to shore.
They found the fifth in the morning.

29:40.542 --> 29:43.459
Apparently he got tangled
in the ropes trying to get off.

29:43.626 --> 29:45.501
He hit his head and passed out.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.209
They never really figured out

29:47.376 --> 29:50.084
how he managed to find himself
on the beach later.

29:50.251 --> 29:53.751
As you can imagine,
it was hell here.

29:55.209 --> 30:01.001
The next morning,
your father was nowhere to be found.

30:01.084 --> 30:08.667
Your mother...
My God... She was distraught.

30:08.751 --> 30:13.292
I told her he was a coward,
that he was afraid of the responsibility.

30:13.459 --> 30:18.709
She got upset with me.
She packed her things and left.

30:18.876 --> 30:22.251
She never came back.

30:22.334 --> 30:25.501
- Hey, watch out.
- Can I keep it? - Not really.

30:25.667 --> 30:29.376
But, auntie... Please.

30:31.292 --> 30:34.959
I'll be careful. I promise.

30:38.251 --> 30:41.792
Alright, but be careful.

30:42.417 --> 30:49.751
Auntie... I'm sorry about before.

30:50.542 --> 30:51.917
It's all right.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.459
I'm off to the kitchen.
Dinner won't cook itself.

31:40.126 --> 31:45.876
- Neurology, may I help you?
- Hello? This is Lucas Borski.

31:46.042 --> 31:50.917
Has my mum woken up?

31:52.709 --> 31:55.709
I got him! Did you see that?
First time round!

31:55.792 --> 31:57.501
I'm sorry, I'll call you tomorrow.

31:57.584 --> 32:00.001
- What?! Fourth time.
- Shut up!

32:00.167 --> 32:03.542
- What do you want?
- Nothing. We're bored.

32:03.626 --> 32:04.709
I don't care.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.709
We'll talk once
you've lived here longer.

32:06.792 --> 32:11.251
I don't have to live here.
I can leave whenever I want.

32:11.334 --> 32:12.667
Yeah, right...

32:15.709 --> 32:19.167
Gentlemen,
this goes in the hall for now...

32:20.251 --> 32:24.667
Those are my things!
Mine and my mum's!

32:24.834 --> 32:29.376
Lucas, I had to do it.
The bank took your home.

32:29.542 --> 32:32.626
Why didn't you tell me before?!

32:32.792 --> 32:34.834
Lucas!

32:35.001 --> 32:37.376
Lucas!

32:38.167 --> 32:41.251
Lucas, please!

32:41.334 --> 32:43.292
Leave me alone!

32:44.126 --> 32:47.417
- Lucas, open the door. Let's talk.
- No.

32:47.501 --> 32:49.001
Open at once!

32:49.626 --> 32:51.459
When mum wakes up,
then you'll see!

32:51.626 --> 32:53.126
Open up!
What are you doing?

32:53.292 --> 32:56.084
You're a thief!
Mum will never forgive you!

32:56.667 --> 32:59.334
Should I bring another key?

32:59.917 --> 33:01.376
Lucas!

33:04.959 --> 33:07.501
I've had enough of you!
Get it?!

33:07.667 --> 33:11.209
Of you, of the Cliff...
and your stupid rules about knocking!

33:11.292 --> 33:12.917
Lucas, stop!

33:22.376 --> 33:24.542
Auntie?

33:29.042 --> 33:31.292
Are you there?

33:37.001 --> 33:38.917
Auntie?

34:19.751 --> 34:20.792
Turn back.

35:15.251 --> 35:16.542
Auntie?!

35:17.084 --> 35:19.042
Of course that's me

35:21.876 --> 35:29.626
Lukas? What's wrong with you?
I am... not well...

35:31.084 --> 35:34.709
Maybe you should eat something?
Come to the kitchen

35:34.834 --> 35:36.501
May I eat here?

35:37.334 --> 35:39.667
Yes, if you want...

36:14.084 --> 36:16.292
What are you doing?

36:21.709 --> 36:23.584
I'll go and make a new one.

36:23.667 --> 36:28.084
No, no need, I am not hungry.
I'm very sleepy now.

36:28.167 --> 36:30.417
Are you sleeping in a bathrobe?

36:30.501 --> 36:32.251
I'm a bit cold.

36:32.334 --> 36:36.167
- Maybe I should turn the heating on?
- No, no need.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.417
So ok.

36:44.459 --> 36:47.501
Then good night to you
Good night Aunty

39:41.792 --> 39:43.459
Hi weirdy!

39:48.209 --> 39:52.542
Wait! I will not hurt you.

40:13.501 --> 40:14.876
Weirdy...

41:41.542 --> 41:47.084
He shouldn't be here.
We are leaving just after the breakfast.

41:49.959 --> 41:51.459
Good morning.

41:52.917 --> 41:54.751
Go to the kitchen.

42:23.542 --> 42:30.292
Last guests are leaving today.
Better stay away and go for a walk

42:34.959 --> 42:35.959
Or do something.

43:13.917 --> 43:16.459
This is our area.
You mustn't walk here.

43:16.542 --> 43:19.167
Keep quiet.
Everybody can walk here.

43:19.834 --> 43:22.834
Why is one of your legs shorter?

43:23.042 --> 43:23.917
I was in hospital.

43:24.001 --> 43:28.292
Didn't you hear it?
He got accident. His mother died

43:28.376 --> 43:30.376
No! She is still alive!

43:30.501 --> 43:31.626
Quiet please.

43:32.292 --> 43:34.001
Oh noo!

43:34.584 --> 43:36.876
Rubbish... take it.

43:37.459 --> 43:41.501
You can use it... Let's go.

44:30.584 --> 44:31.584
Take care!

45:36.501 --> 45:42.459
- Lucas! What are you doing?
- Me? I'm knocking...

45:43.167 --> 45:48.709
- What for?
- You told me to.

45:49.542 --> 45:52.167
Yes, but the guests have all gone home.

45:52.334 --> 45:53.709
You're still here.

45:53.792 --> 45:58.709
And you thought
I'd be sitting in the broom cupboard?

46:00.126 --> 46:02.917
You're acting all weird,
you know that?

46:03.084 --> 46:04.417
Sorry.

46:05.751 --> 46:09.751
I don't know,
perhaps it's natural at your age...

46:09.834 --> 46:13.501
I'll go upstairs. My leg hurts.

47:32.126 --> 47:35.417
Weirdo!

47:42.042 --> 47:44.209
Where are you?!

48:06.084 --> 48:07.167
Weirdo?

48:11.876 --> 48:14.209
Where have you gone?

51:17.792 --> 51:18.667
Post-ies...

51:22.376 --> 51:24.917
Tool-er...

51:43.376 --> 51:45.334
Entrailor?

51:46.501 --> 51:49.001
Strange...

52:54.876 --> 52:57.209
A mannequin...

53:07.626 --> 53:09.584
Is anyone out here?

53:09.667 --> 53:13.417
It's nicccce of you to ssstep by...

53:23.126 --> 53:25.626
Lucas!

53:33.417 --> 53:35.917
- Mum?
- I love you.

53:40.292 --> 53:41.751
Lucas!

53:44.001 --> 53:46.084
Lucas!!!

53:48.167 --> 53:50.667
Don't be ssscared...

53:50.751 --> 53:55.167
Who are you? Where am I?

53:55.251 --> 54:00.334
- Where are you from?
- I... came through the door...

54:01.376 --> 54:03.834
The door?

54:04.042 --> 54:09.417
There's a door in High Cliff.
It's blue... I came in through it...

54:10.584 --> 54:13.042
I've got to go.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.876
Can you hear me?

54:16.501 --> 54:18.751
Can you hear me?

54:19.126 --> 54:21.709
I really must go.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.917
Nooo...

54:25.084 --> 54:28.417
- Auntie will be worried.
- Auntie?

54:29.084 --> 54:32.084
Yes, auntie.

54:32.167 --> 54:35.792
- Are there more?
- Pardon?

54:35.876 --> 54:41.042
In your world, are there more of you?
More?

54:41.126 --> 54:43.792
- People? Oh, many.
- Hundredsss?

54:43.876 --> 54:47.126
More like billions.
We're all over the place.

54:47.209 --> 54:50.542
- I remember now. Sssomeone told me.
- Someone?

54:50.709 --> 54:53.584
Sssomeone else. Billionsss.

54:53.751 --> 55:01.417
- I'll be off then.
- Isss there anything you'd like?

55:01.501 --> 55:04.167
For this stupid knee
to stop hurting! Yes.

55:04.334 --> 55:06.084
What are you doing!?

55:06.667 --> 55:08.459
What are you doing!?

55:08.751 --> 55:10.126
Let go!!!

55:16.709 --> 55:19.126
It doesn't hurt...

55:19.792 --> 55:21.001
Thank you...

55:21.167 --> 55:23.959
Don't thank me.
I did something for you,

55:24.042 --> 55:26.542
so you'll do something for me.

55:26.709 --> 55:31.042
- But what?
- It'sss really nothing...

55:31.126 --> 55:33.251
I want you
to take something with you.

55:33.334 --> 55:36.459
- What?
- A souvenir.

55:38.417 --> 55:39.709
Give me your hand.

55:49.667 --> 55:54.251
Ssso you don't forget
the poor old Entrailor.

55:54.417 --> 55:58.459
I'm sure I won't forget you.
Good bye!

56:36.626 --> 56:41.001
Turn back if possible.
Turn back.

56:43.792 --> 56:46.251
Go. Straight.
For. Three. Hundred. Metres.

56:49.251 --> 56:52.876

57:48.501 --> 57:50.501
You have reached your destination.

57:50.584 --> 57:53.084
You have reached your destination.

57:56.084 --> 57:58.917
Thank you for travelling with me.

58:17.292 --> 58:19.584
Thank you for travelling with me.

58:19.667 --> 58:23.709
Thanks!
I wouldn't have got here without you.

58:25.251 --> 58:28.126
Oh! I've got something for you!

58:35.751 --> 58:37.834
Peep peep Peep!

58:39.584 --> 58:41.792
Here, kitty kitty!

58:45.334 --> 58:48.084
Weirdo. Come on.

58:48.251 --> 58:51.876
Ouch! What? What are you doing?

58:51.959 --> 58:56.709
Turn around. Turn around if possible.

59:02.126 --> 59:04.542
Stupid bird.

59:14.959 --> 59:20.042
Yes, auntie.
All right, I'll be there in a minute.

01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:12.376
- Where were you?
- I was taking a walk.

01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:15.126
- At this hour?
- It just happened.

01:00:15.209 --> 01:00:17.126
Do you know
what I've been going through?

01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:18.209
Sorry...

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:21.542
- Why aren't you answering your phone?
- The battery died.

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:24.626
- The battery died?
- Don't shout, auntie.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:26.001
I'm not shouting!

01:00:40.209 --> 01:00:43.084
I was worried about you!

01:00:44.876 --> 01:00:49.959
- Next time, tell me where you're going.
- Sure.

01:00:57.459 --> 01:01:02.251
All right. Come on, let's eat.

01:02:23.751 --> 01:02:26.626
- Auntie...
- Lucassss?

01:02:27.251 --> 01:02:31.167
Do you want sssomething to eat?

01:02:45.626 --> 01:02:48.167
- Leave me alone!
- It's me...

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:49.251
What a fall!

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:52.167
What's up with you, sis?
Are you going on a date?

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:56.167
- Shut up! He needs help!
- Have we got a straightjacket?

01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:58.501
Can't you see
something's wrong with him?

01:02:58.584 --> 01:03:02.292
- It's not me, it's auntie!
- Two straight jackets!

01:03:03.459 --> 01:03:06.167
I did something bad to auntie!

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:10.376
- You murdered your own aunt?
- No, it was the Entrailor! He did it!

01:03:10.459 --> 01:03:13.959
- The Tailor?
- The Entrailor. He's from another world.

01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:16.334
There's no such thing.
He's pulling our legs.

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:22.251
- Shut up! He's not pretending!
- Please! Help me...

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:39.417
- It looks weird, right?
- I'm never going in there! Let's go!

01:03:39.501 --> 01:03:43.959
- All right, you can stay.
- Alone?! Are you nuts!?

01:03:51.126 --> 01:03:52.376
It's dark in here...

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.417
I don't like it here...

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:05.251
What a mess. Do you ever clean up?

01:04:11.084 --> 01:04:12.209
What?

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.251
Auntie?

01:04:19.584 --> 01:04:24.167
You've brought guessstsss,
how niccce...

01:04:24.251 --> 01:04:27.417
I like guessstsss...

01:04:35.459 --> 01:04:40.459
Would you like to eat sssomething?
I sssure... would.

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:41.792
This way!

01:04:46.376 --> 01:04:49.334
What is that?! What is that?!
What the heck is that?!

01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:54.001
- Some kind of mutant.
- Mutant what?

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:56.667
- I told you!
- I thought you were mad!

01:05:00.459 --> 01:05:02.501
We need more!

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.167
Quick!!!

01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:20.584
Lucas, she's your aunt,
do something!

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.667
We can escape
through the terrace!

01:05:22.792 --> 01:05:24.001
Oh, no...

01:05:26.376 --> 01:05:27.542
Not like that!

01:05:27.626 --> 01:05:29.376
Move.

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:35.667
Bucky! Aaah! Aaah! Help!

01:05:44.042 --> 01:05:45.751
Leave him!

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:50.126
Quick! She's busting through!

01:05:53.292 --> 01:05:55.709
- Lucas, I'm scared!
- On the count of three!

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:58.376
One, two, three!

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:05.417
Run for it!

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:08.542
Over there!

01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:18.084
Move. I don't have much space.

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:20.501
She wants to kill us!

01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:27.792
- It's not her. - Oh yeah?
Well who was chasing us, genius?

01:06:34.084 --> 01:06:39.584
It's not her fault. She's... Infected.
She should go to hospital.

01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:53.834
It doesn't look curable.
I reckon she's done for.

01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:56.459
That's not true!

01:07:04.876 --> 01:07:06.459
Where did this string come from?

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:10.417
I told you. The Entrailor.
He controls them.

01:07:10.584 --> 01:07:14.376
- We need to get him!
- Why us? It's none of our business!

01:07:14.459 --> 01:07:18.501
- They'll be everywhere soon.
- And we'll all die. Stupid.

01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:36.084
- She's not here.
- Are you sure?

01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:43.917
Not really...

01:07:48.876 --> 01:07:50.542
Come on.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:17.959
We can go through here.

01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.126
Lucas, catch!

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:48.417
Thanks.

01:08:52.001 --> 01:08:54.542
- I don't want to go in there...
- Just go!

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.959
Thanks.

01:09:04.376 --> 01:09:06.834
Where to now?

01:09:22.126 --> 01:09:24.209
Lucas, watch out!

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:41.126
Quick!

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.334
To the blue door!

01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:01.584
- What am I doing here?
- Hopper, shush!!!

01:10:09.334 --> 01:10:11.251
Oh no.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.334
We're done for!

01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.501
Have YOU gone crazy?!
Are you nuts?!

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:33.167
Come in.

01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:59.292
- Look, it's stopped hurting again!
- Great! Can you fly?

01:10:59.459 --> 01:11:01.251
- Awesome!
- I told you!

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:02.876
- Hey, are we going?
- Where?

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:05.917
- To kill the Entrailor.
- No way. I'm going back.

01:11:06.001 --> 01:11:08.251
Great. Say hi to his aunt.

01:11:30.209 --> 01:11:34.626
- These colours...
- Right... they're pathetic. All girly.

01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:37.042
My mum would like them...

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.167
Has your mum
been in hospital for long?

01:11:40.626 --> 01:11:43.501
Yes. She's in a coma.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:48.959
She didn't wake up after the accident.
But she will.

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:17.626
- I really fancy a pizza.
- Which toppings?

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:20.751
- All of them.
- How about pineapple?

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:25.126
- Ew, I hate vegetables.
- Pineapples are fruit, dumbbell.

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:29.834
- Hey! Wait!
- Get a move on!

01:12:46.001 --> 01:12:48.001
They're following us.

01:12:49.126 --> 01:12:52.417
- What are they?
- These weird birds.

01:12:53.376 --> 01:12:59.501
- What do they want?
- I don't know. But I don't like it.

01:13:19.167 --> 01:13:21.751
- That's where he lives.
- In that old place?!

01:13:23.501 --> 01:13:26.251
Look, there's a passage.

01:13:34.334 --> 01:13:36.167
- We're done for.
- Shut up, Hopper.

01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:38.251
What are we doing?!

01:13:38.334 --> 01:13:40.126
Scram!!!

01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:06.042
Hopper!

01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:19.959
Hopper. are you all right?!

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:24.209
- I don't know. What did they do?
- Nothing, they just ate the string.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:27.459
Really? Is it edible?

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:30.709
If only we could get them
past the hedge,

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:32.751
they could eat all the string.

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.626
Straight.

01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:46.959
- If I'd known you had biscuits...
- Shhh! You'll scare him.

01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:13.376
We need you.

01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:20.876
- This is it.
- I don't want to go.

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:22.709
You can stay and guard the door.

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:25.167
Are you nuts?
You want me to stay here alone?

01:15:25.334 --> 01:15:28.459
You crybaby!
I can't stand you sometimes...

01:15:28.626 --> 01:15:30.667
OK, I'll stay With him.

01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:32.667
Let's go.

01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:48.667
Be quick,
or else Agata will get us!

01:15:56.001 --> 01:15:57.709
I'm back.

01:16:01.334 --> 01:16:04.459
You made me wait ssso long...

01:16:07.459 --> 01:16:13.292
But I'm patient.
I've got lotsss of time...

01:16:13.376 --> 01:16:21.084
- What did you do to my aunt?
- I jussst wanted to look after her.

01:16:21.167 --> 01:16:24.459
I'm going to look
after you kidsss asss well...

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:28.126
- Just you try!
- Now.

01:17:01.209 --> 01:17:03.584
Turn back. Turn...

01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:07.542
Did you really thhhink
you could beat me?

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.376
I thought they could do it.

01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:55.501
They could
if there were more of them.

01:17:55.667 --> 01:17:58.251
They'll never make it past the hedge.

01:17:59.167 --> 01:18:02.084
Look! A tool shop!

01:18:16.209 --> 01:18:20.459
Oh, what's this?
Your dad's jacket...

01:18:21.042 --> 01:18:27.459
- Did you know my dad?
- Oh yesss... We met... onccce...

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:34.959
WKL thirty nine...
It was a beautiful night...

01:18:38.959 --> 01:18:42.042
That night I unleashed a storm..

01:18:42.126 --> 01:18:47.501
...four of them got to shore,
the fifth should've been mine...

01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:53.792
But your dad...

01:18:58.084 --> 01:19:02.001
Your dad took something
which was supposed to be mine.

01:19:02.167 --> 01:19:05.584
That's why I had to punish him.

01:19:05.876 --> 01:19:09.334
And now I will take care of you.

01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:12.417
Lucas, help!

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:16.709
Lucas!!!

01:19:18.501 --> 01:19:20.417
Lucas!!!

01:19:24.376 --> 01:19:26.292
Lucas!!!

01:19:28.417 --> 01:19:30.209
Lucas!!!

01:19:40.417 --> 01:19:43.001
No, no, no!!!

01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:25.667
- Have they eaten it all?
- No! Not yet.

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:38.501
Monia? What...

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:42.001
I wonder what mum's
made for dinner.

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:01.876
Auntie!

01:21:07.917 --> 01:21:10.751
Lucas, look!

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.792
What pretty...

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:22.334
...birds.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.792
Mum...

01:22:00.417 --> 01:22:02.334
Lucas...

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:05.542
Are you there?

01:22:06.376 --> 01:22:10.334
Lucas?! My God!
I've been here the whole time!

01:22:10.417 --> 01:22:11.751
You've woken up!

01:22:11.834 --> 01:22:18.334
No, son,
it's you who've woken up!

01:22:19.417 --> 01:22:22.501
- Doctor!
- Is it urgent? We've got a problem...

01:22:22.584 --> 01:22:25.459
- He woke up!
- I know, three kids at the same time.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:27.459
No, no! Lucas woke up!

01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:31.417
- That's impossible.
- Lucas...

01:22:33.584 --> 01:22:36.001
Four? At once?!
God, it's a miracle!

01:22:36.084 --> 01:22:38.292
- I'm calling the Head!
- Lucas...

01:23:03.334 --> 01:23:05.792
There was a huge living room
and a kitchen...

01:23:05.959 --> 01:23:10.126
The door to your room was blue.

01:23:10.334 --> 01:23:13.292
I told you that story
when you were asleep.

01:23:13.459 --> 01:23:19.084
- Really? About dad?
- Yes, that as well.

01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:24.667
About how we met.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.709
About every day we spent together,
before he died...

01:23:28.876 --> 01:23:32.459
Mum, dad didn't die!
Dad was on the boat.

01:23:32.626 --> 01:23:38.001
- He saved someone! He's a real hero!
- Of course.

01:23:38.084 --> 01:23:40.709
What about auntie?
Can we visit her?

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:42.709
My sister...

01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:48.334
...has been dead for years.
She died when you were tiny.

01:23:51.501 --> 01:23:54.542
I told you about her too.

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:09.042
- Hello!
- Ms. Cybulska!

01:24:09.209 --> 01:24:11.001
Hello!

01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:14.667
My sunshine!

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:18.751
I have something for you!

01:24:44.459 --> 01:24:48.501
Quick! At the end of the corridor!

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.542
Monia?

01:24:52.876 --> 01:24:54.751
Monia!

01:25:06.292 --> 01:25:09.751
- You guys?
- Who else could it be?

01:25:09.834 --> 01:25:11.459
What are you doing here?

01:25:11.542 --> 01:25:14.126
We've just woken from comas.
How about you?

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:17.709
- Don't be silly, Bucky.
- How do you know my name?

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:21.126
- Do we know you?
- Of course! I'm Lucas!

01:25:21.209 --> 01:25:23.917
You're Monia and you're Hopper.

01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:28.334
High Cliff...

01:25:29.042 --> 01:25:30.709
The Entrailor...?

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.126
Aunt Agata...

01:25:35.042 --> 01:25:38.542
- Don't you remember?!
- Get a grip, we're famous now!

01:25:38.626 --> 01:25:41.167
If you say things like that
when they interview us on TV,

01:25:41.751 --> 01:25:44.084
you'll make us look stupid.

01:25:44.626 --> 01:25:47.876
But I'm not joking!
We entered the silver world.

01:25:47.959 --> 01:25:52.667
Hey, calm down.
There's no such thing as the silver world.

01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:55.792
It's scientifically impossible.
Must have been a dream.

01:25:55.959 --> 01:25:58.834
Exactly.
My dream was completely different.

01:25:59.001 --> 01:26:03.459
There were these weird birds
with fur and foil wings.

01:26:04.001 --> 01:26:06.376
- You're crazy, you know that?
- Foil wings...

01:26:07.584 --> 01:26:10.001
- Sis...
- You're nuts.

01:26:10.626 --> 01:26:14.167
- Get off me, right?
- Ok. Do we play a game?

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:16.042
- What?
- The usual!

01:26:16.126 --> 01:26:19.792
- You're so boring.
- New boy! Are you playing with us?

01:26:34.042 --> 01:26:35.751
- This one's nice.
- It's beautiful.

01:26:35.834 --> 01:26:40.834
We're on holiday in High Cliff now.
We go for walks every day.

01:26:40.917 --> 01:26:44.542
We chat and laugh a lot.

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:48.292
Everyone tells me
I spent those few months

01:26:48.459 --> 01:26:53.417
...in hospital lying in bed
and sleeping.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:07.459
Maybe, but I don't think
that's the whole truth.

01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:35.042
Mum says she believes me,
but I think that like most people,

01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:39.667
she's scared of what
she can't understand.

01:27:42.167 --> 01:27:43.126
Dad...

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:45.709
Mum!

01:27:45.876 --> 01:27:51.459
I decided not to say anything more
about the world behind the blue door.

01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:55.501
I don't want her to be scared.
