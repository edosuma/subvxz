00:06.006 --> 00:08.925
[theme music playing]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.678
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:28.069 --> 00:30.155
Bean, it's really you.

00:30.238 --> 00:33.658
Yes, Mom, it's... it's me. I grew.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.201
Mostly my teeth.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.996
You... You were turned to stone.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.708
My God! And you freed me? Bean, I...

00:42.542 --> 00:44.210
[crying]

00:44.294 --> 00:46.671
I... I can't believe you're back.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.590
This is all so crazy.

00:48.673 --> 00:52.635
[stammers] I can't really believe
that you're alive and Elfo is dead.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.138
I had to choose between... I had to choose you. [sighs]

00:57.724 --> 01:01.644
Oh, there, there. Don't cry, darling.
Mommy's here now.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.898
Wow. I feel better already.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.232
What do you call this?

01:06.316 --> 01:07.734
Affection.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.911
Hey. Who goes there?

01:17.994 --> 01:21.498
[Bean] Princess Tiabeanie
and Queen Dagmar!

01:21.581 --> 01:23.333
Oi, you havin' a bit of a laugh?

01:23.416 --> 01:27.128
Princess Bean is always drunk
at this hour, and you ain't even slurring!

01:27.212 --> 01:29.422
And Queen Dagmar? [laughs]

01:29.506 --> 01:31.049
She's been dead for years.

01:31.132 --> 01:35.345
No, but I haven't eaten in over a decade,
so hurry up and open the gate.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.680
[gasps] Your Majesty...

01:37.764 --> 01:39.349
[screams]

01:40.517 --> 01:43.770
I deserve this fate for doubting you!

01:55.031 --> 01:59.077
Ah, that unforgettable stench
of manure and boiling cabbage.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.161
There's cabbage?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.833
[shrieks] The ghost of Queen Dagmar!

02:04.916 --> 02:06.543
Is it really you?

02:07.544 --> 02:09.963
Bunty. Still adorably dim, I see.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.215
Dim as the day is long, Your Majesty.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.342
Stop poking the royal tit, dear.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.427
[indistinct chatter]

02:17.011 --> 02:18.888
Sorcerio, Odval.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.182
I can't believe my eyes.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.104
Dad! Dad! You're not gonna believe this!
Open up!

02:26.187 --> 02:28.231
[groaning] Come on...

02:28.898 --> 02:32.110
Whoa! Holy mother of Bean.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.695
Is it really you?

02:33.778 --> 02:35.697
Why don't you kiss me and find out?

02:35.780 --> 02:36.823
Whoa.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.913
I've been dreaming of this moment
for 15 years.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.749
Look at you.
You haven't changed a bit.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.334
[chuckles]

02:48.418 --> 02:50.712
And you. You've only got bigger...

02:50.795 --> 02:52.547
[stammers] Better.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.715
[chuckles]

02:53.798 --> 02:58.178
I was so sad about losin' ya,
I turned to food for solace.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.637
But you're back!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.514
Let's throw a huge feast!

03:01.598 --> 03:03.641
I don't need
all that attention, sweetheart.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.311
I'll arrange for something
small and tasteful.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.396
[crowd cheering and applauding]

03:10.398 --> 03:11.983
[crowd] Dagmar!

03:19.157 --> 03:20.116
Incredible.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.828
All that malarkey with the magic elf blood
actually paid off.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.581
It took all season, but it did.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.585
And by season, I mean fall or summer,
or whatever this is.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.378
[herald] Hear ye, hear ye!

03:32.462 --> 03:36.049
Returning to the court
for the first time in 15 years,

03:36.132 --> 03:42.138
once a statue, now statuesque,
it's the dagmarvelous Dagmar!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.641
[all cheering and applauding]

03:44.724 --> 03:46.559
The long wait is over.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.937
Your wonderful queen has arrived.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.856
Aw, aren't you sweet, darling?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.441
[all gasp]

03:53.524 --> 03:56.152
Thank you for your kind gasps.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.779
It's wonderful to... [gasps]

03:58.363 --> 04:02.408
Uh, ladies, it's gonna be okay.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.119
Odval, explain how it's gonna be okay.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.705
I'll begin with an introduction.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.668
Queen Oona of Dreamland,
meet Queen Dagmar...

04:11.751 --> 04:13.586
Also of Dreamland.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.630
The cotton candy shop called.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.215
They want their hair back.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.092
[door closes]

04:19.175 --> 04:22.804
Really, I only married her
to get the canal built.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.013
How practical.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.974
Yeah, real practical.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.769
She also gave me a son, so now,
I finally got an heir to the throne!

04:29.852 --> 04:31.229
Also practical.

04:31.312 --> 04:35.441
And you allowed that amphibian
to raise my precious Tiabeanie?

04:35.525 --> 04:38.319
No, no, no.
I was mostly raised by Bunty.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.280
And a bunch of friendly drunks
down at the pub.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.448
They taught me the fine art of stabbing.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.368
Believe me, I kept her
on the straight and narrow.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.995
Uh, when I had time.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.289
Dad tried for years
to find the Elixir of Life.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.457
We searched the entire world.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.918
Good men died to bring you back, baby.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.587
Yeah, like Elfo, my best friend.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.341
Aw, that sweet, poor little bastard
with the funny head.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.467
I'm gonna miss him.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.887
Sounds to me like he deserves
a marvelous funeral.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.014
Great idea.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.599
I'll get someone to fish him
out of the corpse pit.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.268
[bell tolling]

05:14.230 --> 05:16.232
[bagpipes playing

05:31.956 --> 05:35.001
You know, I'm gonna miss that Elfo.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.545
He watered my plants while I was in rehab.

05:40.131 --> 05:40.965
[honk]

05:45.428 --> 05:47.805
Hey, Tess, what happened to your eye?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.557
Oh, I had to stop using the eye.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.268
It's just too painful
seeing the truth all the time.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.271
Ah, that's why humans tend to avoid it.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.694
The procession left without me.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.696
Oh, that's too bad.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.616
I blame myself
'cause I didn't even notice.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.702
The queen's place
is at the side of the king.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.414
Oh, Queen Oona. Of course.
This is terribly awkward.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.293
Please, take my spot.
I'll find another place to sit.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.420
Mmm, that's better.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.758
Yeah, sure. Both of yas with me.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.885
Plenty of Zog to go around.

06:26.844 --> 06:29.013
Beanie, make with the eulogy already.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.432
[sighs] Okay, here we go.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.603
Elfo and I had only been friends
for a few months,

06:35.686 --> 06:38.564
but they really were
the best months of my life.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.566
Even though much of his time was spent

06:40.650 --> 06:43.236
as the subject
of barbaric medical experiments...

06:43.319 --> 06:45.154
She's talking about me.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.907
...he changed the way I looked at things.

06:47.990 --> 06:53.121
In a kingdom of talking cats
and enchanted pigs and hooker fairies,

06:53.204 --> 06:55.832
Elfo grounded me in reality.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.419
I'm really, really going to miss him.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.551
Rest in peace, buddy.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.053
Sorry they had to bury you
in this aquarium.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.314
[grunts] After the king goes the queen!

07:20.398 --> 07:23.734
Sorry, Queen Oona.
I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.

07:23.818 --> 07:28.656
For the last time, they are not feathers.
I am not bird-type!

07:29.198 --> 07:30.241
[crowd gasps]

07:30.324 --> 07:32.118
You will respect me!

07:32.201 --> 07:35.163
You are not the queen.
You are reanimated corpse!

07:35.246 --> 07:37.081
How dare you!

07:39.500 --> 07:41.294
[both grunt]

07:41.961 --> 07:45.131
[all] Queen fight! Queen fight!
Queen fight!

07:45.214 --> 07:47.216
Your Highness, do something.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.427
Ladies, ladies! Come on!

07:49.510 --> 07:51.846
I'm much more embarrassed
than I am aroused.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.021
[all gasp]

08:12.909 --> 08:14.410
Elfo! No!

08:14.494 --> 08:16.621
There, there. He's with the crabs now.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.545
Mom! Oh, my God, are you okay?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.465
You know what, Oona? You're insane!

08:27.548 --> 08:29.217
Why don't you just get out of here?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.259
[Oona growls]

08:36.349 --> 08:40.186
Ha! I foresee trouble
in someone's future.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.563
You're going to have to choose, sire.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.857
You can't have two queens.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.611
[groans] I can't just tell
one of 'em to get lost.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.655
Dagmar is the love of my life.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.784
And Queen Oona is the mother of Derek,
the heir to the throne.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.120
Oh, nonetheless, she is quite unpopular
in the kingdom.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.624
We've gotten dozens of complaints
about her late-night howling.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.044
If we disgrace Oona,
it could mean war with Dankmire.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.964
Queen Oona has outlived her usefulness.

09:08.047 --> 09:12.301
I don't think anyone would care
if she were to vanish.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.054
[hisses]

09:15.137 --> 09:18.099
We will see who is going to vanish.

09:21.727 --> 09:26.983
I had Odval clear my schedule,
so we got the whole night to ourselves.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.901
Oh, darling. So ambitious.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.446
[Luci] Excuse me. Pardon me.
Cat with a ball.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.323
Bean, you poor baby!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.617
What a horrific day you've had.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.328
Let's have too much wine
and forget about it all.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.373
Hey, I thought we were gonna have wine
and forget stuff.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.916
Dad, come on!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.836
This is my first chance
to have a conversation with a parent

09:46.919 --> 09:49.005
without half of it being muttered
under their breath.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.049
[mutters] What is this, some kinda
slam against me? Well, okay.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.175
[Luci grunts]

09:53.801 --> 09:56.304
Kick me out... Why, I oughta...
[continues muttering]

09:58.931 --> 10:02.184
I can't believe
I'm reduced to talking to you.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.895
Hey, the feeling is mutual,
but here we are.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.148
So, how did you... Oona!

10:07.231 --> 10:10.109
Hey, sweetie, wait! Let's talk. [panting]

10:12.361 --> 10:16.365
Damn. Well, it's gonna be
another long, lonely night.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.034
Good night, Vip. Good night, Vap.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.039
[screams] Don't sneak up on a guy...

10:23.122 --> 10:25.249
Oh, wait. [chuckles]
Nothing to be scared of.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.961
Ooh, silly me.
It's just a statue of Pendergast...

10:29.045 --> 10:30.796
that I've never seen before.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.759
Sculpted in a bizarre
and unlikely pose. Huh.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.221
Oh, well. Who can say
what passes for art these days? [chuckles]

10:42.308 --> 10:44.018
I had them make brunch for us.

10:44.101 --> 10:48.814
All your favorites: poached dodo eggs,
unicorn bacon and waffles.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.442
How thoughtful,
but Bean and I are going riding.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.779
Okay. Be safe, darling. [kisses]

10:58.032 --> 11:00.159
Wub you, snuggums!

11:01.452 --> 11:04.038
Ugh, have some dignity, man.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.749
You're the king,
not some lovelorn old fool.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.250
How did you get like this?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.710
You really wanna know?

11:09.794 --> 11:13.589
Then pour a drink, light a cigar
and hand 'em both to me.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.760
<i>I was known as Zog the Warrior Prince.</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:20.805
Had enough?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.182
Uh, yup. I'm good. [groans]

11:23.683 --> 11:27.144
[Zog] <i>My older brother Yog,</i>
<i>who'd been next in line for the throne,</i>

11:27.228 --> 11:29.355
<i>-was mysteriously poisoned.</i>
-[choking]

11:29.438 --> 11:33.943
[Zog] <i>So the crown was mine,</i>
<i>but I was no ruler. I was a fighter.</i>

11:34.026 --> 11:36.612
<i>Fighting, competing, winning.</i>

11:36.696 --> 11:38.572
<i>That was all I wanted to do...</i>

11:40.449 --> 11:42.410
[crowd cheering and applauding]

11:42.493 --> 11:44.995
[Zog] <i>...until I laid eyes on her.</i>

11:47.790 --> 11:50.876
<i>A noble's daughter from a far-off land,</i>

11:50.960 --> 11:53.796
<i>and she was all I'd ever wanted.</i>

11:53.879 --> 11:56.132
<i>Our life together was perfect,</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:57.883
<i>and it only got perfecter</i>

11:57.967 --> 12:00.428
<i>-when our one and only child came along.</i>
-[Bean babbles]

12:00.511 --> 12:02.722
She's got her father's nose.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.140
Nice grip.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.892
[Zog] <i>But then came that fateful night.</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:10.563
<i>After my brother was poisoned,</i>
<i>I'd been so careful,</i>

12:10.646 --> 12:15.901
<i>but as time went on,</i>
<i>I was so happy, I just sorta forgot.</i>

12:15.985 --> 12:17.987
I'm afraid the taster is late, sire,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.989
but I've brought up a bottle
from the cellar.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.657
The seal is unbroken.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.793
No, no, Beanie. That's not for you.
[chuckles]

12:32.877 --> 12:35.963
God knows, as my daughter,
you'll have plenty when you're older.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.257
Come, Zoggy. Make a toast.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.341
Gwapes!

12:44.221 --> 12:46.140
To our little family.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.687
No! Oh, no!

12:51.771 --> 12:55.858
-Please, not her. No!
-[Dagmar] Bean?

12:55.941 --> 12:58.110
<i>The poison had been meant for me,</i>

12:58.194 --> 13:01.322
<i>but because Bean</i>
<i>had switched the glasses, I lived,</i>

13:01.405 --> 13:04.909
<i>and my beloved Dagmar was turned to stone.</i>

13:04.992 --> 13:07.661
Now, I poured my heart out to you.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.790
You tell me, how'd you get to be
a talking cat?

13:10.873 --> 13:15.044
You keep shoveling waffles in your mouth
while I think of an answer. [vocalizing]

13:19.632 --> 13:23.052
This is where I come to clear my head,
or to sleep it off.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.388
[sighs] I can't believe
it's hardly changed at all.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
You know this place?

13:27.556 --> 13:30.518
I used to come here
when I needed a minute for myself.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.312
Your father, bless him,
but his voice does carry.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.856
How cool that we both come up here!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.650
Tell me something else that you like.

13:37.733 --> 13:41.237
-Well, I love the smell of wet grass.
-Me, too!

13:41.320 --> 13:43.322
Oh, how funny. We're so alike! All right, favorite food on three.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.368
One, two, three.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.452
-Beer!
-Beer!

13:48.536 --> 13:51.247
-Oh, my baby. Are you thirsty?
-Always.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.540
Off to the pub.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.257
I fear my days are numbered.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.844
We will send a message to Dankmire,
of the utmost urgency.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.516
[turkey clucking]

14:10.599 --> 14:14.436
Not a word of this to anyone.
The royal family would not approve.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.896
Bah! To hell with them!

14:16.522 --> 14:20.526
Zog will pay. Dagmar will pay!
Tiabeanie will pay!

14:20.609 --> 14:22.653
They will all pay!

14:23.153 --> 14:25.155
I have to warn the princess.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.289
Oh, come on, Martin, you twit. Aim!

14:33.372 --> 14:35.332
I love how you already know everyone. It's almost like you were never away.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.794
Almost.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.588
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you, Bean.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.840
I know you've had some difficult years.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.383
Bad shot, mate!

14:44.466 --> 14:46.176
I'm sure your father tried.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.595
He got my best friend killed.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.972
Yes, well, I said "tried."

14:50.055 --> 14:52.474
Throw the bloody thing, Wayne!

14:52.558 --> 14:53.976
As I was saying,

14:54.059 --> 14:57.396
your father did all he could,
but a girl just needs her mother.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.314
I know.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.983
Man, you have no idea
how much I've missed you.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.527
I am so glad to have you back.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.113
And I'm not going anywhere
without you, Bean.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.364
Remember that.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.130
[slurring] Hey, hey, Bunty,
can you steer my stumbles

15:23.213 --> 15:24.381
in the direction of the bed?

15:24.465 --> 15:26.592
I just need... Is... I know...

15:26.675 --> 15:30.262
All right, I know you're still in shock
that my mom is back.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.766
I'm in shock, too. I mean, it is shocking.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.726
It is shocking.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.770
But, hey, hey, hey, Bunts...

15:37.853 --> 15:43.067
Here's the thing.
Here's the positive thing here,

15:43.150 --> 15:45.027
is you won't have to do as much

15:45.110 --> 15:47.363
'cause she'll be here
to hold my hair back and stuff.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.239
You know? You know what I mean?

15:49.865 --> 15:50.699
Bunts?

15:51.700 --> 15:52.868
What are you doing?

15:54.244 --> 15:55.537
[gasps]

15:55.621 --> 15:57.748
Oh, man. Oh, man!

15:57.831 --> 15:59.750
You gotta help me! Please!

15:59.833 --> 16:02.378
Bunty has been turned to stone,
and I just...

16:02.461 --> 16:04.171
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.297
[gasps]

16:08.884 --> 16:11.178
[screaming]

16:13.097 --> 16:15.808
We have to do something. Now!

16:15.891 --> 16:17.643
Any one of us could be next.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.270
Women aren't permitted
to address the council.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.231
But you're the only one in here!

16:22.314 --> 16:23.565
Then it's unanimous.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.234
Shut up, will ya?

16:25.317 --> 16:28.737
Ah, I should've done something earlier,
but now, I got no choice.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.489
I have to take action.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.865
I hate action!

16:31.949 --> 16:33.575
But against whom, sire?

16:33.659 --> 16:34.910
It's gotta be Oona.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.288
She's finally snapped
after years of us being dicks to her.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.082
Any attack against Queen Oona

16:40.165 --> 16:42.876
would be seen as an act of war
on Dankmire.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.255
A war you'd have to fight
with most of your cabinet turned to stone.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.049
Zog was the greatest warrior
Dreamland has ever seen.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.260
You dare question his fitness for battle?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.302
Not at all.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.431
Only the wisdom of proceeding
without a strategy for--

16:55.514 --> 16:56.932
My clothes are really heavy.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.601
Can we have this conversation
sitting down?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.354
[sighs] You know what? Never mind.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.232
Zoggy, you have to.
Before she comes after one of us.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.610
We can't let our family
be ripped apart again.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.741
[Derek] "More tea, General?"

17:13.824 --> 17:15.743
"Why, certainly, my good man."

17:17.202 --> 17:20.706
Father! To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

17:20.789 --> 17:22.916
So, listen, son.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.212
Your mother and I,
we've been having some, um...

17:27.296 --> 17:28.964
difficulties lately,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.760
and I'd like to lock you in the tower
until we sort things out.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.387
All right. But you'll come get me later?

17:35.471 --> 17:39.641
Sure. Once we work things out,
whoever survives will come and get you.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.645
Okay, but I'm still having nightmares
about that big skillet.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.190
We couldn't find Oona anywhere, sire.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.776
I'm afraid we made the mistake
of trusting her.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.445
She could get any of us at any moment.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.405
We gotta split up and search for her.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.699
Hmm, I have a better idea.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.869
Go ahead, sire.
Don't ask about my fourth eye!

17:59.495 --> 18:03.916
Almighty ball, is Oona still in Dreamland?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.919
-"Yes."
-[all gasp]

18:07.002 --> 18:09.379
Wait, its answers are often cryptic. Is Queen Oona in the castle?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.802
"The danger is near."

18:15.302 --> 18:16.261
Let me try.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.679
Where is--

18:17.763 --> 18:19.014
[screams]

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
Enough! No more time for parlor tricks.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.602
We've got to protect ourselves.
I'll watch Bean.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.270
And we'll track down Oona.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.650
I'll use my skills as a hunter
and Odval will use his diplomacy

18:29.733 --> 18:31.735
to stab her with a broom handle.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.409
Follow me, darling.
We'll be completely safe up here.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.830
Wow. Does Dad even know about this room?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.665
No. It's called the library.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.675
Huh. So, what was going on here?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.010
Neat trick.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.388
Then what happened?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.181
[tape rewinds]

19:02.099 --> 19:04.852
<i>Let me try. Where is--</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:06.019
[screams]

19:06.103 --> 19:07.354
Whoa.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.606
Can we try running it back
a little further?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.276
Actually, a lot further?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.443
[tape rewinds]

19:21.785 --> 19:24.663
You can rest easy now
and get some fresh air.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.748
I used to spend many nights up here,

19:26.832 --> 19:29.501
watching the stars, the moon,
the neighbors.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.921
Mom? That's never happened before,
the thing with my fingers... As you reach maturity,
you will notice many more changes.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.094
Duh. I already know.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.596
This isn't a sex talk.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.682
Oh. What kind of talk is it?

19:43.765 --> 19:46.935
There are some things you need to know
about yourself, Bean.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.251
Oh, my!

20:16.673 --> 20:18.717
[Zog] The old castle mental ward.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.554
[Odval] Someone left the door open.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.643
-Hey.
-[both scream]

20:28.227 --> 20:31.271
Oona, is that you?
I missed you so much, baby.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.814
Quick, Odval, stab her in the neck!

20:32.898 --> 20:34.691
[chuckles] Calm down.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.861
I've got something real for you
to freak out about.

20:38.862 --> 20:42.324
Dude, the truth has been
right under your nose the whole time,

20:42.407 --> 20:43.992
but you were too in love to see it.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.452
Show us what happened here.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.372
Okay, now let's take it back
about 15 years.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.456
[tape rewinds]

20:56.421 --> 20:58.173
<i>To our little family.</i>

21:03.804 --> 21:05.097
<i>No! Oh, no!</i>

21:05.180 --> 21:08.642
<i>-Please, not her. No!</i>
-[Dagmar]<i> Bean?</i>

21:09.142 --> 21:10.185
Incredible.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.229
It's exactly as I remembered it.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.274
Except, this time, watch from over here.

21:15.899 --> 21:16.900
[tape rewinds]

21:17.943 --> 21:19.820
<i>...but I've brought up a bottle</i>
<i>from the cellar.</i>

21:19.903 --> 21:21.655
<i>The seal is unbroken.</i>

21:31.415 --> 21:32.416
Dagmar?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.459
She poisoned the wine?

21:34.543 --> 21:38.005
But if Bean hadn't switched
the glasses around, I'd be--

21:38.088 --> 21:41.925
Uh-huh. Out there in the garden
with pigeons crapping on your head.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.010
More so than usual.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.971
But I devoted my life to her. I...

21:46.972 --> 21:48.265
How could she?

21:48.348 --> 21:51.727
Looks like she's been keeping
quite a few secrets from you, my man.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.730
[Zog] What the...
A movable knickknack nook?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.064
[growls]

21:56.148 --> 21:59.943
The thing about your father, Tiabeanie,
is that he wants to change you.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.529
I want you as you were born to be.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.657
What was I born to be? Mom?

22:05.741 --> 22:09.328
Damn small print.
This had better be the right one.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.705
[door opens]

22:12.664 --> 22:13.498
Oh!

22:21.882 --> 22:22.841
[Zog] You.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.385
The only woman I ever loved.

22:25.469 --> 22:29.598
Do you know what I did for you?
What I gave up to get you back?

22:32.893 --> 22:36.938
[sighs] Elfo, I just wish I could see you
one last time.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.191
[panting]

22:39.274 --> 22:44.279
You know, we could've just gone
to marriage counseling.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.281
This goes way beyond you and me, dear.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.951
It is a dark battle of a hundred centuries
and our daughter's destiny.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.745
Not if I can help it.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.122
[Zog grunting]

22:55.665 --> 22:56.583
Come on!

23:18.563 --> 23:21.191
Huh? What is that? Goo?

23:24.361 --> 23:25.195
Yikes!

23:28.949 --> 23:31.993
Summon the army!
This kingdom is under attack!

23:32.077 --> 23:36.998
By a ruthless enemy
who will stop at nothing. My wife!

23:37.082 --> 23:40.794
-[soldier] Which one?
-I do know how to pick 'em, don't I?

23:43.588 --> 23:46.508
[Dagmar] We must go, darling. Quickly.
The attack has begun.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.093
What? Whose attack?

23:48.176 --> 23:52.097
I'm afraid it's Oona.
She is coming for us. For you.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.348
For me?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.768
You, and you alone, are the key
to the future of this kingdom.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.270
All you need is my guidance.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.021
Really?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.442
Sire, we've rallied the troops. Get out. Run! Save yourself.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.611
From what?

24:06.695 --> 24:08.864
[all screaming]

24:12.284 --> 24:13.160
[man] Oh, no.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.287
I should be the one killing everyone.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.164
I should be the one creeping everyone out.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.040
[gasps] You!

24:19.124 --> 24:19.958
-[Luci yelps]
-[pop]

24:21.626 --> 24:23.628
[all screaming]

24:30.844 --> 24:34.473
[stammering] Wait, this is...
this is just... It's a lot.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.683
I know, sweetie. This way.

24:36.766 --> 24:40.145
What did you mean when you said,
"The future of this kingdom"?

24:40.228 --> 24:42.564
Are you saying I'm some kind of hero?

24:42.647 --> 24:45.525
They're such relative terms,
aren't they, darling?

24:45.609 --> 24:48.111
Hero and villain? One step up.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.155
-I didn't say "villain."
-[Dagmar grunts]

24:51.865 --> 24:53.575
[Bean screaming]

24:57.120 --> 24:58.872
Mom, what did you do that for?

24:58.955 --> 25:02.000
It was the only way to get you
to stop talking. Now swim for that ship.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.971
Welcome aboard,
Queen Dagmar and Princess Tiabeanie.

25:15.055 --> 25:18.683
Mom, what are these creatures,
and why are they looking at me that way?

25:18.767 --> 25:23.438
Bean, you have so much to learn
and many wonderful things to see.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.317
Set sail!
For the homeland and a glorious future!

25:44.417 --> 25:45.752
[sighs]

25:45.961 --> 25:50.549
I guess the only bright side is,
now I got nothing left to lose.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.509
[groans]

25:52.592 --> 25:53.760
[splash]

25:53.843 --> 25:57.347
Except the thing that says I'm a king!

25:57.514 --> 26:00.183
Ah, come on!
