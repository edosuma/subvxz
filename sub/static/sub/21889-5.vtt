Don't worry. DJ will be cool with it.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.696
What...?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.531
What have you done to my kitchen?

01:15.241 --> 01:16.743
I am not cool with this.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.246
Wow. I was way off.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.708
FBI, Kimmy thinks tonight

01:23.792 --> 01:27.378
is a simple housewarming dinner
at the old Gibbler house.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.799
Don't you mean FYI?

01:31.883 --> 01:33.134
No. FBI.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.303
Fernando's Big Information.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.766
So, FYI,

01:40.517 --> 01:43.937
Kimmy does not know that
Jimmy and I have painstakingly

01:44.020 --> 01:49.275
restored her childhood home back
to its full Gibbler glory.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.362
Really?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.906
Like, every weird artifact?

01:55.281 --> 01:56.825
-Even the egg-shaped--
-Yes.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.203
-Not the humongous--
-Yes.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.789
-What about the rubber--
-No, no.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.668
You can only find those in Thailand.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.795
Now, remember.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.047
Not one word to Kimmy.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.259
-[Kimmy] Hey, Deej.
-Hey.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.386
I said not one word.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.265
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.058
So, check it out. Got my cast off.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.393
-Nice.
-[DJ] That's great.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.187
And now I can finally take a real shower.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.439
-[Kimmy] Oh, hallelujah!
-[DJ] Thank goodness.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.067
In other news,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.402
Kimmy, I want you to know,

02:32.485 --> 02:35.738
the only reason I'm going to this party
is because Jimmy invited me.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.907
Not because I'm curious to see the house.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.367
You've never been inside?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.619
Nope. I was not welcome.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.291
Oh, sweet cheese.
You chose not to come over.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.252
Because when I was five,
you told me your house was haunted.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.880
It was haunted.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.048
By a friendly ghost named Mr. Mutchnik.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
You are such a liar, liar, pants on fire.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.345
You owe me an apology.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.639
I do not, because I'm not a liar.

03:02.307 --> 03:06.019
As far as the pants-on-fire thing,
that was one time at a fondue restaurant.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.147
Come on, you guys.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.774
Just say you're sorry
so we can have fun tonight.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.027
-You're right. I'm sorry...
-Thank you.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.528
...that you're out of your mind.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.364
In that case, I'm sorry...

03:18.448 --> 03:20.158
-Thank you.
-...that you're an idiot.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.870
Girls, you are killing the she-wolf vibe.

03:23.953 --> 03:27.457
Yeah, let's put aside our squabbling
and enjoy being part of the pack.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.875
[howls]

03:30.376 --> 03:32.128
-[all] No.
-[Kimmy] You're not allowed to.

03:34.839 --> 03:35.673
Hey, everybody.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.764
Hey.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.185
Cuteness has arrived.
And I also brought the baby.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.312
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.481
Becky's doing the show from New York.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.108
I've been stuck with this butterball
all by myself.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.110
I'm jonesing for adult conversation.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.863
[all talk in baby speak]

04:01.574 --> 04:03.284
Still jonesing.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.327
Come here.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.120
Here's adult conversation.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.165
We're going out tonight,
so you're babysitting all of our kids.

04:09.999 --> 04:10.875
Oh, goody.

04:12.710 --> 04:17.090
And can you work some of that
Uncle Jesse magic on Jackson and Max?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.925
Sharing a room is driving them nuts.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.344
You bet.
I never met a kid I couldn't handle.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.637
Except this one.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.181
Just won't go to sleep for me at night.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.892
But tonight that is all gonna change. Oh!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.435
And you do need a change.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.562
Here.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.480
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.690
[Ramona] Oh, hey, Jesse.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.316
-Hey!
-[Max] Hey, Jesse, Pamela.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.652
There's all the kids I love so much.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.612
Small, medium, large, and...

04:40.238 --> 04:41.406
Pneumonia, was it?

04:43.157 --> 04:45.326
-It's Ramona.
-That's what I said-- Ramonia.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.287
-Ramona.
-Ramonia.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.289
-Ra...
-Ra...

04:49.372 --> 04:51.040
-Mo... Na.
-Mo... Nia.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.463
Come on, come on,
Pamela Donaldson Katsopolis.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.257
I need you to go to sleep. Please.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.508
No, no.

05:00.591 --> 05:01.676
Will you go to sleep?

05:04.929 --> 05:05.805
All right.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.515
Here's your binky.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.726
Here's your bibby.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.936
And here's your woobie.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.355
Great.
Come on. I need you to get serious.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.024
Watch the little purple bee.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.610
Watch the bee go round, and round,

05:20.486 --> 05:21.487
and round...

05:23.948 --> 05:24.949
[screams]

05:25.033 --> 05:26.034
[Pamela laughs]

05:26.117 --> 05:27.160
You woke me!

05:27.243 --> 05:29.245
You little crazy!

05:30.038 --> 05:30.955
It's not funny.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.332
It's not funny.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.501
Jesse. I need your help.
Pretend you're a cute guy.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.840
Ouch.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.385
You know what I mean.
Pretend you're a young guy.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.098
Ouch!

05:50.516 --> 05:54.270
Anyway, I'm starting high school soon,
and I want a new look.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.731
Should I go blonde or curly?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.816
Oh. Do not go blonde.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.985
Maintaining blonde roots are a nightmare!

06:02.987 --> 06:04.322
I can help you with a perm.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.866
-You've done it for Becky?
-No, for myself.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.037
One of my many hairstyles over the years.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.706
Here you go.
You got your classic mullet Jesse.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.501
Your perm Jesse.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.044
Yeah.

Farrah Fawcett Jesse.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.511
And your Rachel-from-Friends Jesse.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.059
Hey! What did you do to my bed?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.437
I turned it into
an enchanted dinosaur village.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.358
Dinosaurs don't live in villages, genius.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.400
Well, mine do.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.570
It's called "imagination."

06:45.947 --> 06:48.533
Well, this is called "retaliation."

06:51.410 --> 06:54.372
That's it! You jerk!
That took me an hour to make!

06:54.455 --> 06:55.540
[Jesse] Whoa, whoa!

06:55.623 --> 06:57.416
Hold it there. Get off!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.709
He's a little turd.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.753
And he's not living up to his potential.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.799
Stop it now, guys.
Just say, "I love you" and hug.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.134
Now!

07:06.217 --> 07:07.844
What a grump-opotamus.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.555
Get over it. I love you, hug, go.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.722
[Max and Jackson sigh]

07:11.806 --> 07:13.057
Fine. I love you.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.976
Fine. I love you, too.

07:18.146 --> 07:18.980
Good enough.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.649
Say, who has two thumbs
and can fix any kid problem?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.234
This guy.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.862
Why do you talk like that?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.490
Guess who will choose to ignore that?

This guy.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.828
[Pamela] Daddy? Daddy?

07:33.911 --> 07:35.663
Oh, God. That baby won't go to sleep.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.707
Here's a very good lesson in parenting.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.459
Let them cry. Show them who's boss.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.585
[Pamela shouts] Daddy!

07:40.668 --> 07:42.044
Coming, baby angel!

07:49.427 --> 07:51.596
It feels so strange being back here.

07:52.346 --> 07:56.184

time I walked in and out of this house.

Oh, look! It's the clown doorbell.

the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!

I know!

I'm a miracle worker.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.831
I feel like I'm home again.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.626
I feel like I should call
and let someone know where I am.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.924
It is great going down,
but, man, it is a bear going back up.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.302

Oh. You have a farting couch, too.

No, that was me.

is your ghost.

Not that I believe in ghosts, but...

Is there a ghost here?

There is no ghost. Kimmy told a big lie.

of disciplining their children.

up here and went to Napa?

No talking during time-out.

sleep with your cousin.

When did Legos get so big?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.848
I fell asleep doing my homework,
and Max built a wall around me.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.769
I wanted to make my room great again.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.815
I'm busting out of here.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.029
Yeah, that's right. I'm tough.

11:38.614 --> 11:42.284
Yeah, you just busted through a toy wall
that's recommended for ages 3 to 7.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.202
So you...

11:45.079 --> 11:46.122
I'm almost in high school.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.582
Why do I have to share a room
with a fourth grader?

11:48.666 --> 11:51.335
Because Mom wants me to help you
with your homework.

11:53.087 --> 11:53.921
Boom!

11:56.006 --> 11:59.343
What has two thumbs
and just burned their brother? This guy!

All right, A, stop stealing my bits.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.140

12:04.223 --> 12:05.474
Good. Do it.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.017
Please. Do it.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.936
Well, I did it.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.271
Say hi to your roommates.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.607
You can't do this.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.443
Oh, yes, he can.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.279
And he did.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.615
And I'm loving it!

12:26.203 --> 12:27.913
-Hello?
-What?

12:27.997 --> 12:29.498
You forgot my perm solution?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.958
Oh, right, OK. All right.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.960
The three of you, get to sleep right now.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.628
Uncle Jesse, what about dinner?

12:34.712 --> 12:37.006
You kids are so high-maintenance.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.801
I'll make you dinner. Come with me.
We'll walk and squeeze.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.554
Walk and squeeze. Walk, squeeze.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.389
And walk. Work.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.891
Are we gonna have any fun?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.350
[Pamela] No.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.366
Cotton candy on the cob is delicious.

13:05.659 --> 13:06.911
It is in season.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.708
Kimmy,
when did your mom and dad move out?

13:13.417 --> 13:15.628
Y2K.
They built a bunker in the Everglades.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.674
They'd be so disappointed
to know the world never ended.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.428
That's why we didn't tell them.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.726
Well, I have seen a lot of weird things
here tonight, but no ghost.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.438
[organ plays]

13:34.522 --> 13:35.356
Mr. Mutchnik.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.315
Welcome back.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.735
What just happened?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.031
Nothing. Kimmy's trying to scare us.
Pathetic.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.244
You OK, Matt?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.579
Yeah, yeah.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.497
I just...

13:52.540 --> 13:54.917
wanted to tell you what I want
for Christmas.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.172
Which is to leave right now.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.635
For the last time, there is no ghost.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.804
[circus music plays]

14:06.887 --> 14:08.722
[neighing sound]

14:10.140 --> 14:15.396
OK, so there's a slight chance that
there might be an itty-bitty baby ghost.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.939
[circus music stops]

14:18.065 --> 14:19.525
And he kidnapped Matt.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.529
No, no, I'm good.
I'm just here looking for my contact lens.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.950
Honey. You don't wear contacts.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.786
Fine. I'm looking for my courage.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.709
So, was I right, or was I right?

14:37.293 --> 14:42.172
Well, it's possible that
you might be not wrong.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.801
So, I was right!

14:45.885 --> 14:49.555
Ooh, it's like a hot-fudge sundae
for my soul. Booyah!

14:51.974 --> 14:54.852
That doesn't change the fact
that when I was a kid,

14:54.935 --> 14:57.897
you made me feel like
the annoying tagalong little sister

14:57.980 --> 14:59.315
that nobody wanted around.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.357
Well, you were.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.406
But now, you're the annoying tagalong
little sister that we do want around.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.407
Oh.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.075
Thanks, Kimmy.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.995
I'm sorry I called you a liar.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.248
I'm sorry I never made you
feel welcome here when we were kids.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.083
Come here, squirt.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.255
Oh! The she-wolf pack is back!

15:25.049 --> 15:26.425
[all howl]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.469
[organ plays]

15:29.053 --> 15:30.846
Sorry, I thought I turned that off.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.682
Wait a second.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.227
You rigged all this?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.188
Uh-huh, because DJ told me to.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.105
What?

15:40.606 --> 15:41.440
No, I didn't.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.985
Excuse me, but you said you wanted
Kimmy and Steph to stop arguing

15:45.069 --> 15:47.905
so obviously you wanted me
to create the illusion of a ghost

15:47.988 --> 15:51.659
using an elaborate series of pulleys,
levers, and electronic devices, duh!

15:55.412 --> 15:58.123
Wow, I have to be careful
about what I say around you.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.335
You all do.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.633
So, it turns out that Kimmy was wrong
and I was right.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.345
Ooh, it's like a hot-fudge sundae
for my soul. Booyah!

16:11.428 --> 16:13.305
[circus music plays]

16:14.598 --> 16:16.725
Ha-ha, Jimmy. Joke's over.

16:17.851 --> 16:18.978
I'm not doing that.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.397
He's back!

16:21.897 --> 16:23.482
[screaming]

16:34.159 --> 16:35.911
I am starting to understand

16:35.995 --> 16:38.205
why this house was so cheap.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.918
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.211
Come on, boy.

16:44.294 --> 16:45.212
There we go.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.257
Come on, girl. Come on.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.550
Come on, little doggies.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.218
Come on, come on.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.096
Come on, over here. Come on. Here we go.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.889
Here we go. Sit. Sit.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.642
All right. Sit. Sit.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.352
Stay.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.604
Who gets a treat?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.398
-[both] Me!
-OK. Good. Here.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.067
While you guys eat these,
here you go,

17:07.151 --> 17:10.904
I'm just gonna tie you up very quickly,
so you don't escape.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.283
There we go. Good?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.951
Now... Oh, I know.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.327
Here.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.288
-You guys wanna draw?
-[Pamela] Yeah.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.873
Let's draw something cool.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.374
Let's draw... me.

17:24.668 --> 17:27.921
You forgot about my hair?
And why are those kids tied up like dogs?

17:29.339 --> 17:32.217
They wouldn't sleep,
so I took them outside to walk.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.387
They chased a cat,
did their business, I brought them back.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.889
Uncle Jesse, behind you.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.017
My "Have Mercy" burgers.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.018
Have mercy!

17:43.562 --> 17:44.563
They're done.

17:46.148 --> 17:46.982
You think?

18:26.396 --> 18:28.107
[beeping]

18:28.690 --> 18:29.775
Smoke alarm is going off.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.652
You think?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.581
[yells]

18:47.000 --> 18:48.252
[alarm stops beeping]

18:50.045 --> 18:50.879
Ouch!

18:54.299 --> 18:55.551
My scalp is tingling.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.136
When do I rinse this out?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.762
Rinse what out? Oh, that!

19:00.013 --> 19:03.475
Right now. Go upstairs,
take the curlers out, I'll be right up.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.978
I better end up looking
like the girl on the box.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.355
She was Swedish and six-foot-two.
But I'll do what I can.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.068
[groans]

19:13.152 --> 19:13.986
No!

19:14.403 --> 19:16.989
Why did you guys draw on there?
I gave you paper.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.492
You're supposed to draw on the paper.
Not the wall.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.162
Not the-- come on.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.374
Stay away from the kids.
He's covered in mud.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.918
Get off me, Costco. Get off.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.587
Off. Off. Off.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.590
Cosmo played in a mud puddle.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.884
You think?

19:38.760 --> 19:40.262
Hey, are my burgers done?

19:40.345 --> 19:41.763
No, your burgers are burnt,

19:41.847 --> 19:45.058
because I told you to watch them
and tell me when they were done.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.811
[Jackson] I watched them
for a little while, but it got boring.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.729
Uh-huh.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.982
Anyway, looks like they're done.

19:52.065 --> 19:52.900
Get out!

19:54.985 --> 19:56.069
There!

19:56.153 --> 19:57.779
Now you're having duck burgers.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.199
Guess what, Max?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.825
I took a visit to my old room,

20:01.909 --> 20:05.245
and I "accidentally" wiped my nose
on your stupid unicorn.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.705
[shouts] You monster!

20:06.788 --> 20:08.332
This is for Uni!

20:08.415 --> 20:09.249
Hey, hey!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.295
You're dead!

20:16.506 --> 20:18.425
But I feel so alive!

20:18.508 --> 20:21.053
[Jackson] Take that!
All over your new shirt, too.

20:21.136 --> 20:21.970
Take that!

20:22.054 --> 20:23.680
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:23.764 --> 20:24.723
Hey!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.518
I've had just about enough from you guys!

20:29.603 --> 20:31.688
I'll make you wish
you had never been born!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.485
Hi, girls. How was dinner?

20:36.568 --> 20:38.737
[Stephanie] What? What's happening?
Oh, my God.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.489
You're gonna do my dry cleaning!

20:42.991 --> 20:44.409
It's not as bad as it looks.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.211
Look what Jesse did to me.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.422
That's as bad as it looks, yeah.

20:59.883 --> 21:03.053
[high-pitched] I look like a troll
from the movie Trolls.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.932
My life is over.

21:09.142 --> 21:13.522
And I can't get my voice
to stop doing this!

21:19.069 --> 21:22.197
Why are the babies tied to a bar stool?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.407
What?

21:23.490 --> 21:24.741
[DJ gasps]

21:24.825 --> 21:27.953
And why are they coloring
all over my island?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.414
And on their faces?

21:31.206 --> 21:34.001
-What happened to the drapes?
-Why does it smell of smoke?

21:34.084 --> 21:36.253
Why are you covered in fire retardant?

21:36.336 --> 21:38.463
And why are you cooking a ceramic duck?

21:40.924 --> 21:41.758
Well...

21:42.676 --> 21:44.303
Because your kids are wild animals!

21:46.388 --> 21:48.223
This is how they express creativity.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.102
I've always hated those drapes.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.647
Which I tried to put out
with this clearly faulty extinguisher.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.524
And that duck needed to die!

22:04.740 --> 22:06.533
Any more questions?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.702
[alarm beeping]

22:08.785 --> 22:10.162
Yeah. What is that beeping?

22:10.245 --> 22:11.455
[growls]

22:18.712 --> 22:20.714
Yeah, anyone could take the battery out.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.842
I'm going upstairs to fix my hair.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.346
[Jesse growls]

22:30.682 --> 22:33.185
Well, that babysitter is not getting paid.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.107
[sighs]

22:39.191 --> 22:42.110
Well, everything is cleaned up
and back to normal.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.780
Well, except for Ramona's hair.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.157
She still looks like a giant Chia Pet.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.244
Uncle Jesse, are you OK?

22:51.787 --> 22:52.746
No, I'm not.

22:54.539 --> 22:55.916
I can't do this anymore.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.669
You guys keep Pamela.
I'll come back in another 17 years.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.340
Oh, she likes Elmo and Chance the Rapper.

23:03.965 --> 23:04.966
Wait, wait, wait.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.219
What happened to you tonight?

23:08.595 --> 23:09.638
I don't know.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.142
I guess raising kids
was harder than I remembered.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
You think I lost my dad mojo?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.481
Are you kidding?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.694
Do you remember
when you lived in this very room?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.906
If those pink bunnies were still
on the walls,

23:27.989 --> 23:32.369
they would remind you of all the amazing
dad talks you gave us right here.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.957
Remember the time I got DJ's part
in that Oat Boat commercial?

23:37.040 --> 23:39.417
She chased me 'round the kitchen,
trying to murder me.

23:40.502 --> 23:41.336
I remember that.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.713
Yeah.
Uncle Jesse saved your life that night.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.717
What is it about that kitchen that
make kids want to kill each other?

23:49.010 --> 23:52.264
No matter how hard the problem was,
you always found a solution.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.226
You were always so patient and kind
and sweet with us.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.856
No matter how bad it was,
you always found a way to make it better.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.150
Where did that guy go?

24:04.359 --> 24:05.277
He's right here.

24:06.403 --> 24:10.157
You just need to dig down through
that grumpiness and crankiness

24:10.240 --> 24:13.869
and find that guy who has
the biggest heart we've ever seen.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.039
I was pretty awesome, wasn't I?

24:20.083 --> 24:22.794
All right, I'm gonna go take another try
with the boys.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.966
How did we get so good at this?

24:29.384 --> 24:30.594
We learned it from him.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.805
Listen, I'm sorry that I lost my cool.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.015
We deserved it.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.516
No, this one was on me.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.226
I wasn't listening to you guys.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.396
I was talking at you,
and I should have been talking to you.

24:42.397 --> 24:43.732
-Can we try it again?
-Yeah.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.317
Come on. Sit down.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.652
Now, I get it.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.071
It's got to be a bummer sharing a room.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.575
There's got to be pluses, too.
I'm sure he helps you with your homework.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.701
He does.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.289
Must be great to have him there
when you have nightmares.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.415
Oh, it is.

25:02.417 --> 25:03.919
You see? This is beautiful.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.630
He's not just your brother.
He's your best friend.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.048
He is.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.219
Do you wanna try the I-love-you thing
one more time?

25:12.802 --> 25:14.054
This time from the heart.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.140
I love you, bro.
