00:03.086 --> 00:05.259
Lucifer was the biggest monster
ever hatched,

00:05.422 --> 00:07.550
until you and I hatched one
that's even worse.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.765
I was the beginning
and I will be the end.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.131
I will be all that there is.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.829
You're taking people's lives.

00:13.931 --> 00:17.185
If you resist, each and every angel
in the skies will smite you.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.006
Can you really beat her?

00:21.104 --> 00:23.277
- I can.
- Then yes.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.533
Lucifer.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.784
Bloody hell.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.117
What about you, little puppy?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.781
Use your tongue.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.542
The Hand of God, a superweapon.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.585
Do you think we can use it against Amara?

00:35.786 --> 00:36.787
What is this?

00:36.954 --> 00:37.955
The Rod of Aaron.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.293
A Hand of God?

00:39.957 --> 00:41.957
If we're gonna fight her,
what better way to arm up

00:41.959 --> 00:43.802
than with an actual dose of his power?

00:43.961 --> 00:45.258
It's kicked.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.634
You're out of juice, huh?

00:48.966 --> 00:50.809
We've got jack on another Hand of God

00:50.968 --> 00:52.641
and we've got even less jack
on how to save Cass.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.976
- Yeah, if he wants to be saved.
- He does.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.202
Noel. I came when you asked.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.626
Looking a trifle peaky.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.542
Do you truly have it?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.005
And it's yours,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.257
if you hold up your end of the bargain.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.901
I've had a good life, thanks to you.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.731
Very few of the world's secrets
I haven't cracked.

02:28.315 --> 02:32.570
It seemed worth a soul at the time.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.662
Oh, it always does.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.832
Destroy that thing.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.661
Show me the object, first.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.216
A shofar,

02:55.592 --> 02:59.597
the Horn of Joshua,
touched by the Hand of God.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.437
Easy. Easy, there.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.484
It's authentic, I can feel it.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.825
Now tear that thing up.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.171
Thank God.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.638
I don't think I have long.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.680
How very prescient of you.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.909
Amateurs.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.697
Are you not hearing me?

04:54.461 --> 04:58.432
I said I have in my possession
the solution to our collective problems!

04:58.590 --> 05:00.592
You should be doing a jig.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.386
I donâ€™t jig.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.314
Now, how do I know
you even escaped Lucifer,

05:04.513 --> 05:05.730
and he's not making you say all this?

05:05.931 --> 05:09.105
Honestly, your cynicism is depressing.

05:11.686 --> 05:16.817
Why would Lucifer force me to discuss
the very means of his destruction?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.489
What're you talking about?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.572
A weapon. One that channels divinity.

05:29.830 --> 05:35.553
Yes, powerful enough to help
destroy a force like The Darkness.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.599
Or Lucifer. Tell me you haven't been
searching for such a thing.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.392
A Hand of God? Of course we have.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.438
Thought as much.
St. Louis, the old post office on Beekman.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.935
Crowley...

05:55.105 --> 05:56.152
Sam!

05:57.357 --> 06:00.861
How do I know that any of this
is working?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.281
I don't feel any different.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.038
For all of your promises.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.422
I warn you,
I'm not one to be trifled with.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.011
That's enough for now, poor wee thing.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.766
But you're coming along.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.058
I'll heal you, just as I promised.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.277
And who are you, again?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.234
One who communes with the natural forces

06:36.438 --> 06:38.861
and channels them
to help the less fortunate,

06:39.065 --> 06:40.533
such as yourself.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.486
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:44.905 --> 06:45.997
You're his mother.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.617
Say what, dear?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.629
Uncle Crowley's mother.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.131
"Uncle"?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.798
He tried controlling me
when I was a child.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.630
Did he send you to bring me back?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.803
Heavens, no, my son and I
loathe each other.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.685
Then why are you helping me?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.981
Because you're going to win, my dear.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.458
Yes, I know all about the grievance

07:14.643 --> 07:16.941
between you and your brother
and his archangel.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.115
I have my own ax to grind with Lucifer.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.949
You know him?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.993
"Know" him?

07:32.077 --> 07:33.374
And yet you live.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.331
Aye. Like yourself, I'm a survivor.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.051
A hard life has taught me to be prepared.

07:40.126 --> 07:45.678
I long ago secreted within my person
a wee casket of powerful magic.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.072
When the spell inside me
sensed my life force ebbing,

08:03.149 --> 08:04.696
it went to work.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.246
And I was revived.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.631
Where is Lucifer now?

08:27.549 --> 08:31.270
He's hidden himself from me,
and I, too, have a score to settle.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.470
All in good time.

08:32.636 --> 08:36.140
Right now, you're still weak from
that pesky angel smiting.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.981
And you can fix that?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.356
Och, aye, and so much more.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.989
You can destroy your enemies
and, I imagine,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.996
remake the world any way you choose.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.417
And I will be by your side.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.015
Nice digs.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.269
The Crypt Keeper out of town?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.938
I'm lucky to be alive.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.775
Lucifer had me trussed up like a dog
in my own palace!

09:23.354 --> 09:25.106
"Palace"?

09:25.315 --> 09:27.192
Oh, you mean the abandoned nuthouse.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.619
He kept me in a kennel!

09:29.903 --> 09:31.905
And he turned all his demons...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.536
My demons, against me.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.244
They scour the earth,
day and night, looking to kill me.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.999
He has to be dealt with.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.629
So is this why you brought us here?
Some lousy grudge match with Lucifer?

09:42.832 --> 09:45.551
Yeah, where's this, uh, Hand of God
you were talking about?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.512
I'm getting to that.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.680
Your only hope of subduing Amara

09:49.881 --> 09:52.304
is to match the level of power
that she possesses.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.136
No kidding. And?

09:54.344 --> 09:58.224
And I have the Horn of Joshua.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.771
Joshua?

10:00.975 --> 10:03.649
As in the Joshua that won
the Battle of Jericho?

10:04.687 --> 10:07.531
And I'm willing to entrust it
to your capable hands.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.744
What? I just said I'd give you the thing.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.666
If...

10:18.368 --> 10:19.870
Is this how you say "thank you"?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.798
You think these things
grow on bloody trees?

10:21.830 --> 10:24.208
Cut the crap, Crowley.
With you, there's always an "if."

10:24.833 --> 10:27.052
Fine, I will give you the Horn,

10:27.252 --> 10:31.598
if you help me exorcise
Lucifer from Castiel's vessel

10:31.798 --> 10:34.551
and then return him
immediately to the cage.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.181
Oh, that's all? Huh.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.980
Okay, and where is this horn?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.478
- Safely hidden, naturally.
- Yeah.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.028
Crowley, even if we could
exorcise Lucifer out of Cass,

10:45.228 --> 10:47.151
the cage is damn near impenetrable.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.607
It took a spell from
The Book of the Damned

10:48.815 --> 10:50.658
to spring Lucifer,
and Rowena hid the book.

10:50.859 --> 10:54.409
And we would need both the book and her
to even have a shot.

10:54.696 --> 10:58.075
Did I say this would be easy?
No, I did not.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.373
Do you even know where Rowena is?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.214
Rotting somewhere, I assume.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.088
Lucifer snapped her neck.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.943
Lucifer.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.820
Jofiel!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.074
How's it hanging?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.622
Easy, there.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.162
So perfect. Castiel,
one of Heaven's most wanted,

11:43.369 --> 11:45.713
possessed by Heaven's most hated.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.040
I come in peace.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.301
I just want to be
a part of the action again.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.968
I want to lend a hand.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.132
Brothers!

12:09.646 --> 12:15.278
Okay, guys, so, trying to smite
The Darkness was a bust, huh?

12:18.905 --> 12:22.079
You had all of the power
of Heaven behind you,

12:22.408 --> 12:23.910
couldn't even slow the bitch down.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.672
Well, no need to feel like abject losers.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.719
You learned a valuable lesson here.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.005
You need me.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.764
All right. Not giddy with awe.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.903
You exploded Jofiel.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.689
Or did Jofiel explode himself?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.530
Just sayin'.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.320
God cast you out of Heaven.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.950
And who do you think
spread that tabloid headline?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.955
It was Captain G, the Eternal One.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.210
And why?

13:10.373 --> 13:17.302
Because I didn't buy into his obsessive,
compulsive love for mankind.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.099
Mankind is his creation.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.143
Oh, come on.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.398
It's not like he invented the Prius,
which actually works.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.820
I don't have to tell you people
what a mess mankind is.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.989
The Salem Witch Trials,

13:37.859 --> 13:39.202
Third Reich,

13:41.154 --> 13:42.406
Twin Towers.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.374
Sure, every once in a while,
he'll send down

13:46.826 --> 13:48.419
a little plague to straighten them out,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.330
but it's nothing permanent.

13:50.621 --> 13:54.592
Humanity brought us Hiroshima
and got a redo.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.178
I merely question his priorities,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.343
and I got the boot.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.516
He said you're evil.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.103
Incarnate.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.985
Evil incarnate.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.904
It's marketing.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.869
He's creating a need
in the consumer's mind.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.203
You can't be a super-savior
if you don't have a supervillain.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.122
So what are you offering?

14:29.660 --> 14:31.958
Well, a way out of this pickle.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.379
By pickle, you mean The Darkness.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.004
You can reason with her?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.556
Well, doubt that.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.551
But I can lock her away.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.145
This time for good.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.896
Done it before.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.566
Oh, Pops didn't tell you that, huh?

14:56.104 --> 14:58.732
Once you've gotten rid of her,

14:59.816 --> 15:01.614
you'll want to...

15:02.985 --> 15:04.737
Stay around?

15:05.405 --> 15:06.998
I like the way you think.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.253
Man, am I jazzed.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.378
Hey, if it makes you comfy,

15:17.750 --> 15:19.218
could call me God.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.387
Hold on, okay,
let's just put it in reverse.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.348
We will put Lucifer back in the cage,

15:28.594 --> 15:31.564
after we put Amara back on ice.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.400
It has to happen in that order,
otherwise there is no Lucifer,

15:34.600 --> 15:36.352
there is no cage, there's no nothing.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.861
He's spent years marinating in hate
against us.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.116
- He has to go.
- Problem is...

15:42.775 --> 15:44.027
We may need him.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.279
He's been down this road
with Amara before.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.077
He might be the only one powerful enough
to use the Horn against...

15:49.282 --> 15:50.909
He had me cleaning the floors.

15:51.284 --> 15:56.211
With my tongue. He called me puppy.
He made me beg.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.208
All right, come on.
Is this what this is about, huh?

15:58.416 --> 15:59.463
Your stupid ego?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.753
The fact that he dissed you
in front of a bunch of stupid demons?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.055
- You're smarter than this, come on.
- Dean's right.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.721
Priority is to put the Horn in Lucifer's
hands and set him loose on Amara.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.893
After we exorcise Lucifer out of Cass
and put him into a new vessel.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.724
What?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.943
- Really?
- Yes, really.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.237
We're not gonna send Lucifer
into battle inside Cass.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.216
- What if he doesn't make it?
- Dean, it's a strong vessel.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.132
It's held Cass for years,
and we know what he's been through.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.571
- I'm guessing it can hold Lucifer.
- It?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.073
It's not an it, Sam, it's Cass.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.075
And Cass wanted to do this.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.956
Yeah, well, there's times
I wanna get slapped during sex

16:34.160 --> 16:36.640
by a girl wearing a Zorro mask,
that don't make it a good idea.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.002
Dean, this is exactly
how we screw ourselves.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.335
We make the... The heart choice,
instead of the smart choice.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.509
Oh, okay, thank you, Dr. Phil.
Cass is family.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.757
Yes, and his choice
deserves to be respected.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.643
- Even if it kills him?
- It's killing me.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.146
I would rather stick
white hot skewers in my eyes

16:54.347 --> 16:56.941
than listen to you two bitches bicker.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.880
I gave you the terms of my deal.

16:59.185 --> 17:03.031
If Lucifer's not back in the cage,
the Horn stays hidden.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.361
The vessel is healing nicely.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.656
Soon you'll be shipshape
and Bristol fashion.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.659
You seem pleased with my progress.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.626
But I don't sense in you
the capacity for kindness

17:20.623 --> 17:21.714
OF concern.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.501
Kindness gets you a hug,

17:24.001 --> 17:25.674
not a seat at the big boy's table.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.347
And what is it you want?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.885
Like yourself, I want revenge on Lucifer.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.475
But more than that,

17:35.054 --> 17:38.649
I want to be there when
you remake the universe to your taste.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.975
Oh.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.485
I'm told my tastes run
towards the catastrophic.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.653
Aye, the Winchesters say
you are all about destruction.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.366
The Winchesters are right.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.532
But...

17:56.325 --> 17:57.827
What they call destruction,

17:59.328 --> 18:01.877
I call renovation.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.549
My blueprints,

18:05.668 --> 18:07.841
- not God's.
- That's my girl.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.047
Do things the way you would've done them.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.220
I will.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.768
And where do you fit into that?

18:18.556 --> 18:20.524
Oh, I can be useful.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.860
Provide you with information

18:23.060 --> 18:25.779
on the troublesome brothers
and Lucifer, their plans.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.200
And even if it is born out
of my own self-interest,

18:30.401 --> 18:31.744
I care about you.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.617
I'm someone you can talk with, confide in.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.413
Have you ever had that?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.757
I've always been alone.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.464
Oh, you don't have to be, darling.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.222
Well.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.735
Whatever you're doing,
it seems to be working.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.605
Maybe I should try a little test.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.568
Thank you. Hey, I like your spunk.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.154
There's always room for a
go-getter in my organization.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.247
Hey, I know I can count on you,
but what about your people?

19:20.451 --> 19:22.954
They on board or
need to do a little wing-twisting?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.089
I'll have to think about it.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.656
Don't think about it too long.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.761
You know what they say, "He who hesitates,
 disintegrates."

19:30.127 --> 19:32.801
You know, this is a dick move, Crowley,
even for you.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.427
You're not being reasonable.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.342
I don't need to be reasonable,
I'm the King.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.950
You look great. You been working out?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.652
Hear me!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.187
What the hell was that?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.273
You know what, fellows?
I think that's her.

21:14.857 --> 21:18.862
And that was a little payback,
ladies and gents.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.287
I don't think Auntie Amara appreciated
your little half-assed smiting.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.378
And guess what? This?

21:28.704 --> 21:32.129
This is just a teeny taste
of what's to come.

21:32.708 --> 21:37.714
So, clearly, my expertise
is gonna come in handy.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.924
'Cause God knows what's next.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.597
Ouch.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.267
I almost forgot. Um...

21:47.932 --> 21:49.104
God doesn't care.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.899
Okay.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.745
I'm back.

22:10.788 --> 22:14.338
Okay, so now we all just saw what happens
when she's in a bad mood.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.511
Which, apparently, she's been in
since the dawn of time.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.972
And then, she just rattled Heaven
with a flick of her pinkie finger.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.266
That's not a big enough dose of reality
for you?

22:28.931 --> 22:32.310
Why are we arguing?
We all know he has to go back in the cage.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.111
Yes, when it makes sense.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.780
Amare is the bigger picture here, okay?

22:38.148 --> 22:41.448
Look, in order to take her out, Lucifer
has got to have the Horn of Joshua.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.701
He does her, we do him. Check, please.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.841
Well? What are the Winchesters
preparing to do?

22:57.001 --> 23:01.347
Nothing. Paralyzed with fear,
they don't know what to do.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.350
You're right.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.806
You're actually handy to have around.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.234
Thanks.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.816
Lovely of you to say.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.319
Crowley, tick tock. You with us?

23:23.694 --> 23:25.992
The crux of your dispute
is your contention

23:26.363 --> 23:31.585
that Lucifer, and only Lucifer,
can use the Horn to beat Amara. Right?

23:31.869 --> 23:34.167
- You got it.
- Well, that scenario only works

23:34.371 --> 23:37.545
if you actually possess said Horn,
which you do not.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.676
No, we don't, but you do, so...

23:39.877 --> 23:41.550
Exactly. I do.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.214
This isn't a negotiation.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.095
I have the high cards and you have...

23:45.341 --> 23:47.560
Hold on, give me a second.
Let me have a look.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.886
No cards.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.352
My offer stands.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.945
When we sprung Lucifer from the cage,
we had Rowena and The Book of the Damned,

23:59.021 --> 24:01.274
both of which we will need
to put him back in the cage.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.784
- Both of which are gone.
- Guys.

24:04.526 --> 24:06.369
- Back to you.
- Guys.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.240
Look at this.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.440
- I hate this.
- Yeah.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.958
By the way, where the hell is Crowley?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.859
I mean, we're essentially all set up.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.682
Yeah, I mean, he's the one
that boxed us into doing this.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.220
- You'd think he'd have the decency to...
- Show up?

24:51.949 --> 24:53.041
He does.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.494
Because without the bait,

24:56.537 --> 25:00.462
well, a trap really isn't a trap, is it?

25:04.211 --> 25:06.305
That's it?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.175
Doesn't look like much, does it?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.351
First impressions can be deceiving, Moose.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.814
For instance, I once thought of you
as dull and plodding.

25:16.432 --> 25:17.979
No, never mind, bad analogy.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.151
For the record,
we still think this is a bad idea.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.032
We should be using Lucifer, not icing him.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.359
I'm aware.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.687
So I'll be standing right here,
should you hesitate.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.239
The hand that giveth
can so quickly taketh away.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.245
Yes, we get-eth, it.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.831
So, Mummy,

25:34.033 --> 25:37.037
you were telling us your
fascinating tale of resurrection.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.086
But you never did say exactly where
you'd been this whole time.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.792
Same as you, Fergus.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.551
Hiding. Once the Dark Prince
knew I was alive, I wouldn't be.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.049
No mucking about like last time.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.343
The warding and the holy fire

25:52.885 --> 25:54.808
won't keep an archangel but for a moment.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.894
- If he shows up at all.
- Oh, he'll show.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.691
Yeah, he's too hungry to take Amara out
and we've got the blaster to do it.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.465
I summon you to make an offer.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.887
The weapon by which its bearer can crush
The Darkness forever.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.109
Sam, now.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.464
I'm sorry.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.595
Your prayer implied that
I'd be joining the team,

27:14.341 --> 27:16.764
but I'm just not feeling
the warm and fuzzy here.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.318
Wow.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.488
There it is,

27:29.565 --> 27:31.943
powered up by Dad himself.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.496
Well, that bad boy plus me,
that ought to take her out, all right.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.457
Let's get to it.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.253
Douse the flames.

27:50.544 --> 27:51.716
Or don't.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.024
Cass?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.733
Castiel, show yourself.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.569
- Dean?
- Cass.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.314
What are you doing? What's...

28:19.489 --> 28:21.457
- What's going on?
- Cass, listen to me.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.120
We don't have a whole lot of time, okay?
You've got to...

28:29.708 --> 28:30.880
Cass?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.388
Castiel, show yourself.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.803
Whoo!

28:41.428 --> 28:43.271
He's got to what?

28:44.473 --> 28:45.599
You boys...

28:47.184 --> 28:49.027
Ooh, you almost had me there for a minute,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.401
but these mail order spells,

28:51.605 --> 28:53.845
they're just not what they're
cracked up to be. Are they?

28:53.899 --> 28:55.151
Cass, expel him.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.569
You got to kick Lucifer out. You hear me?

28:57.986 --> 28:59.112
Honestly?

28:59.279 --> 29:01.623
I think he's happy with the arrangement.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.917
I mean, he did invite me in,
and all, Dean.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.539
- Cass.
-  "Cass."

29:07.663 --> 29:09.961
Hand over the weapon, what do you say?

29:10.791 --> 29:14.295
Or we can just wait
for this warding to fail and I'll take it.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.307
Bloody hell.

29:52.666 --> 29:56.170
Is it going to be all right?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.715
It's going to be all right.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.676
You bet.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.848
Dear friends, it is going to be all right.
It's going to be all right...

30:07.139 --> 30:08.356
Castiel?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.648
Hmm, Crowley? What are you doing here?

30:12.561 --> 30:14.188
Is this the Winchesters' kitchen?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.198
Sort of.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.823
I come here in my mind to pass the time.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.749
For some reason
it has excellent reception.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.831
What's wrong with you?

30:25.365 --> 30:26.708
What has Lucifer done to you?

30:27.534 --> 30:30.754
Oh. Nothing, mostly just leaves me alone.

30:32.873 --> 30:37.049
I'm just waiting here, you know,
for the battle with The Darkness.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.448
He's really got his hooks in you.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.465
Snap out of it.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.609
Do you know what's happening out there?

30:43.717 --> 30:45.437
The Winchesters have trapped
the abomination

30:45.594 --> 30:48.438
so that you can expel him,
so that they can put him back the cage.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.604
That doesn't sound like a very good idea.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.529
In your current state,
you're in no position to judge.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.950
Wait, that was Dean I saw a minute ago,
wasn't it?

31:00.233 --> 31:01.280
Yes.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.739
And he wants me to expel Lucifer?

31:05.405 --> 31:06.452
Yes.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.458
Well...

31:13.580 --> 31:16.129
He may have a more objective view
of the situation.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.761
- Maybe I should.
- So, let's do it.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.884
Now. Before it's too late.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.719
It already is.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.818
Really, Crowley?

31:35.477 --> 31:37.479
You wanna put me back in the cage?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.491
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.619
And neither are you.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.454
You know he's been gone a long time.
I mean, what do you think's going on?

31:55.497 --> 31:57.537
I don't know.
Maybe Cass isn't willing to play ball.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.967
I mean, you said it yourself.
He wanted this.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.010
Can't you people do anything right?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.506
Whilst all this dithering goes on,
we're losing time.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.974
Look. The warding's beginning to fail.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.184
Come on, Cass. What the hell.

32:16.518 --> 32:19.488
You second-rate bean counter.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.362
Guys, you're gonna break something.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.845
You wanted my throne.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.679
Tried to replace me.

32:56.183 --> 33:00.905
As if ambition and posturing
were the same as majesty.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.069
Leave.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.574
Everyone in Hell despises you

33:13.074 --> 33:15.577
and sees you for exactly what you are.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.420
Nothing.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.578
- Crowley?
- Useless.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.288
Lucifer's hold on him is too strong.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.247
Lads, the fire.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.348
Trick me?

34:15.262 --> 34:16.639
You lied to me.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.478
You know, I could've been your warrior.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.649
Ah.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.321
Who needs you?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.367
Well.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.041
It's just like Crowley to leave
right when the party is getting started.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.331
Have a seat.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.338
As much as I get a giggle out of you two,

34:42.871 --> 34:44.168
and I do,

34:44.456 --> 34:48.837
there comes a time when every relationship
has run its course.

34:53.507 --> 34:54.634
So......

35:28.710 --> 35:30.883
Oh... Lucifer.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.223
Dear nephew.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.425
My, how you've changed.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.391
I was tracking her when she left my side.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.451
You were safely sealed away.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.412
You're going to wish you'd stayed there.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.811
I think you and I need to have
a nice long chat.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.652
Cass.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.231
So, Rowena and Crowley,

37:56.065 --> 37:57.237
like mother, like son, huh?

37:57.609 --> 38:01.204
They both took exactly one split second to
take off when things started going south.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.405
- Yep.
- Here.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.121
By the way,
what's Rowena doing with Amara?

38:07.368 --> 38:08.688
My guess, she's playing the odds.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.592
When sucking up to Lucifer
didn't work out,

38:11.206 --> 38:12.846
maybe she thought Amara was the best bet.

38:13.708 --> 38:16.228
Then she heard Lucifer had a shot,
so she switched horses again.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.591
I thought Lucifer had a shot.

38:18.421 --> 38:22.471
Apparently, uh, archangel plus God power
doesn't trump God sister.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.596
But if the thing has to be used
by God's chosen,

38:27.639 --> 38:29.879
then maybe an archangel
who got the boot doesn't qualify.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.562
Either way, the Horn's out of ammo, so...

38:33.895 --> 38:35.442
- So, we're back to square one?
- Yep.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.652
Listen, urn...

38:41.611 --> 38:46.162
I know I came down on the side of
wanting Cass to deal with Amara,

38:46.950 --> 38:48.750
- 80...
- That's what he wanted though, right?

38:50.411 --> 38:51.913
Besides, didn't we say that
we were gonna swear off

38:52.121 --> 38:55.241
getting in the way when one person makes
a choice the other doesn't agree with?

38:57.126 --> 38:58.469
Yeah, um...

38:59.170 --> 39:00.513
Yeah, we did say that.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.138
So......

39:05.468 --> 39:07.311
Okay. So that's our policy.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.311
Which sounds damn good.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.896
Well, let's go find that idiot
and bring him home.

39:24.946 --> 39:25.993
Okay.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.124
Look,

39:30.159 --> 39:31.877
I know you have a major beef with me.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.293
You probably wanna finish me.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.129
But you may want to rethink your position.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.344
'Cause I could actually be of use to you.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.890
- Really?
- You hadn't considered?

39:46.175 --> 39:48.348
We both have an ax to grind with God.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.477
I know his soft spots.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.684
He can't handle us both.

39:54.017 --> 39:58.147
Do you for one moment think that
I would actually consider trusting you?

39:58.646 --> 39:59.738
For anything?

40:02.317 --> 40:04.365
I did trust you once.

40:06.487 --> 40:10.993
You and my brother conspired
to seal me away for eons.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.089
But you're right.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.052
You might be of some use to me.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.391
All right.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.477
Good.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.437
Now we're talkin'.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.310
As God's favorite,

40:37.977 --> 40:43.484
his first son, you may be the one thing in
all of creation that he still cares about.

40:44.484 --> 40:48.580
The one thing that could finally
make him show himself.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.578
So that I can confront him.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.627
And he can acknowledge the wrongs
he has done me.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.875
And then,

41:01.125 --> 41:04.095
he can witness the utter destruction

41:04.504 --> 41:06.302
of all his creation

41:08.049 --> 41:10.268
before he himself is swept away.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.773
You're expecting him? Huh.

41:20.603 --> 41:21.695
Well...

41:23.147 --> 41:24.490
I wouldn't wait up.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.990
I'm pretty sure
he caught the last train out.

41:28.903 --> 41:29.995
Well...

41:31.864 --> 41:33.286
We'll see, won't we?

42:23.791 --> 42:24.838
