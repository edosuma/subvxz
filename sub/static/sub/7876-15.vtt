00:33.370 --> 00:34.709
- 53 Glock 9 mm?
- Check.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.054
- Kevlar vest?
- Check.

00:36.179 --> 00:37.995
before you wreck yourself?

00:38.119 --> 00:39.451
- Check.
- Oh, Stan.

00:39.575 --> 00:41.943
I hate it when you go
on these dangerous missions.

00:42.151 --> 00:44.749
Honey, it's just a two-day
surveillance job.

00:44.874 --> 00:47.398
Trust me, I'll be back in time
for Valentine's Day,

00:47.522 --> 00:49.821
when I'll take you out
for a disappointing set-menu dinner

00:49.946 --> 00:51.583
at the Macaroni Grill.

00:55.218 --> 00:58.645
For a meeting between wealthy arms
dealers, this sure is boring.

00:58.770 --> 01:00.709
Thought they'd at least
have a band...

01:00.834 --> 01:01.899
or juggling...

01:02.383 --> 01:03.630
Juggling is amazing.

01:03.755 --> 01:05.652
Yeah, this is a snooze-fest.

01:06.059 --> 01:09.052
I should be rolling in the sheets
with Lana from accounting right now.

01:09.176 --> 01:11.152
Lana?
I thought she was a lesbian.

01:12.407 --> 01:13.359
She was.

01:13.789 --> 01:16.841
Jim, your ability with the ladies
never ceases to amaze me.

01:16.966 --> 01:18.834
What can I say?
I love women.

01:18.959 --> 01:22.605
This might make me sound like a wuss,
but I get off when they get off.

01:22.773 --> 01:24.566
- Come on!
- I mean it.

01:24.691 --> 01:27.059
That's why I took that class
on sexual energy.

01:27.183 --> 01:30.738
Now I can make a woman quiver
just by looking at her the right way.

01:30.936 --> 01:33.143
Which way?
First boobs, then face, then butt?

01:33.602 --> 01:35.050
No, I mean... Wait.

01:35.535 --> 01:36.808
Something's happening.

01:37.654 --> 01:39.178
The guards are on the move.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.978
But to where?

01:47.125 --> 01:49.057
You guys wanna buy some speaker?

01:51.803 --> 01:54.009
<i>Now back to Tex 'n' Mex.</i>

01:57.282 --> 01:59.709
<i>Thanks to some good
detective work by me,</i>

01:59.834 --> 02:03.032
<i>and to a lesser extent,
my partner Mexican Joey,</i>

02:03.157 --> 02:06.047
<i>the bikini thief is finally
headed to jail.</i>

02:06.171 --> 02:08.550
<i>I guess that only leaves one mystery.</i>

02:08.872 --> 02:10.929
<i>Who ate my sopapia?</i>

02:12.585 --> 02:14.107
<i>Tex 'n' Mex did it again.</i>

02:14.231 --> 02:16.928
Nothing more satisfying
than solving a case.

02:17.096 --> 02:19.589
Has anyone seen my Shuffle?
I can't find it anywhere.

02:19.714 --> 02:23.295
A treasured item gone missing.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

02:23.420 --> 02:25.248
This sounds like a case for...

02:25.587 --> 02:27.243
Wheels and the Legman!

02:47.142 --> 02:50.935
You know, Wheels and the Legman,
the detective duo we created.

02:51.059 --> 02:53.056
I'm Wheels, and Roger's the Legman.

02:53.238 --> 02:56.667
We've been looking for a case,
but now it appears that case...

02:56.952 --> 02:58.003
found us.

03:01.901 --> 03:05.017
Stop that! Look, if you see my Shuffle,
let me know.

03:05.142 --> 03:07.888
There is, madam,
the small matter of our fee.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.047
$20 a day, plus expenses.

03:10.368 --> 03:12.371
Or that half a turkey sandwich
you left in the fridge.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.229
- That's Dad's.
- We have a deal then.

03:34.677 --> 03:36.245
Why so sad, Mrs. Smith?

03:36.370 --> 03:38.967
It's me, Scott, from Langley Flag
and Boot Cleaning.

03:39.703 --> 03:41.980
Say hi to your husband.
He's my best customer.

03:44.275 --> 03:45.373
Stan's boss!

03:45.809 --> 03:48.086
Francine, I have bad news.

03:50.954 --> 03:54.805
My car broke down two blocks from here
and it's just off warranty.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.213
That's the bad news?

03:56.490 --> 03:58.420
Well, actually, there's more.

03:58.545 --> 03:59.878
Father Carrington?

04:03.129 --> 04:06.542
Mrs. Smith, there's no easy way to say
this, so I'm just going to be direct.

04:06.711 --> 04:07.500
Dear God!

04:07.669 --> 04:10.260
I was caught having sex with a man
and I'm being excommunicated.

04:10.385 --> 04:11.373
What about Stan?

04:12.021 --> 04:15.666
Nope. I don't believe Stan has had sex
with Father Carrington.

04:16.051 --> 04:20.079
Also, we lost communications
with Stan 12 hours ago.

04:21.827 --> 04:24.070
I'm trained for this.
Step aside, please.

04:25.713 --> 04:27.175
There, there.

04:32.069 --> 04:33.532
We're gonna die!

04:33.878 --> 04:35.623
I just know it!
I just really do!

04:35.747 --> 04:38.222
Stay cool, Stan.
We've been trained for this.

04:38.347 --> 04:40.522
I know! But I forget!

04:42.685 --> 04:44.360
There's gotta be a way out of here.

04:44.595 --> 04:45.893
You're relieved.

04:47.836 --> 04:49.484
I think our luck just changed.

05:25.069 --> 05:26.068
Halt!

05:26.519 --> 05:27.618
Don't shoot.

05:48.694 --> 05:49.693
Just go.

05:53.835 --> 05:56.757
All right, Wheels. This is the last
place Hayley saw her Shuffle.

05:56.882 --> 05:59.507
Search her dresser for clues.
I'll take the closet.

06:00.244 --> 06:02.877
- Careful!
- Sorry. I'm a little rusty using the chair.

06:12.701 --> 06:14.825
- Just use your legs!
- We can't break character!

06:14.950 --> 06:17.686
- For crying out loud!
- No, no!

06:18.067 --> 06:20.074
I did it.
Look!

06:22.203 --> 06:24.626
A butt-print on Hayley's bedspread,

06:24.750 --> 06:26.604
way too big to be Hayley's.

06:26.729 --> 06:29.596
There are only two people
who could leave a print that big.

06:31.576 --> 06:33.944
Well, it's not Travolta.
So it's gotta be Barry.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.572
Mama, Stan went on a mission

06:40.696 --> 06:43.387
and he's been missing for five days...

06:44.888 --> 06:47.168
What's that in the background?

06:47.293 --> 06:48.850
You're at a movie?

06:49.398 --> 06:52.075
Well, go in the lobby!
You're being rude!

07:01.384 --> 07:03.307
I thought I'd never see you again!

07:03.432 --> 07:04.739
There, there, Francine.

07:04.864 --> 07:06.475
I promised I'd be home in time

07:06.599 --> 07:08.993
to take you out for
a romantic Valentine's dinner.

07:10.326 --> 07:12.708
If I smell at all like sex,
it's because of Jim.

07:13.356 --> 07:17.360
I was on his heels as he porked
our way through 200 miles of jungle.

07:17.765 --> 07:19.385
His hips never stopped moving.

07:19.510 --> 07:20.755
It was magnificent.

07:21.799 --> 07:24.596
- You're... crushing me.
- It's almost over.

07:28.356 --> 07:31.034
Sorry I didn't have time to get you
a Valentine's Day present.

07:31.158 --> 07:34.214
Just having you home safe
is the only present I need.

07:35.398 --> 07:37.017
You know I'll always come back.

07:37.142 --> 07:38.141
I know,

07:38.586 --> 07:41.048
but sometimes
I think about if you didn't.

07:41.284 --> 07:42.376
And you know what?

07:42.565 --> 07:46.156
I think that would be it
for the romantic part of my life.

07:46.429 --> 07:48.114
And that would be fine,

07:48.239 --> 07:51.118
because I would have known
my soul mate,

07:51.243 --> 07:53.015
my one true love.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.947
That's more than most people ever get.

07:56.180 --> 07:57.817
And the memory of our love

07:57.941 --> 08:01.914
would be enough to sustain me
for the rest of my days alone.

08:02.504 --> 08:03.828
How about you?

08:04.167 --> 08:05.751
What would you do if I died?

08:05.875 --> 08:08.072
I'd marry Meg Penner,
my backup wife.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.217
Meg Penner?

08:16.714 --> 08:18.063
Wait, Dr. Penner?

08:18.209 --> 08:19.237
Our dentist?!

08:19.406 --> 08:22.197
Exactly, that's who I would marry next.
She's my backup.

08:22.322 --> 08:24.688
Like that extra pair of underwear
I keep in the car...

08:24.813 --> 08:26.150
just in case.

08:26.318 --> 08:29.525
You already know who you want
to marry after I'm dead?

08:29.692 --> 08:30.671
It's Nothing formal.

08:30.796 --> 08:33.490
Meg and I were talking
during one of my routine cleanings.

08:33.615 --> 08:35.913
The subject came up, and we decided
that if our spouses die,

08:36.038 --> 08:37.563
we'll marry each other.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.828
Wait, Dr. Penner knows about this?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.884
Francine, listen to yourself.

08:43.009 --> 08:45.360
How crazy would it be to plan
a backup marriage

08:45.485 --> 08:47.340
without alerting the backup bride?

08:47.621 --> 08:49.367
That would just be weird.

08:52.018 --> 08:54.600
- Are you in love with Meg Penner?
- What?

08:54.725 --> 08:56.357
No, no, I'm not in love with her.

08:56.481 --> 08:58.369
- Are you sleeping with her?!
- Of course not!

08:58.494 --> 09:00.894
Then why are you making
all these plans with her?

09:01.019 --> 09:03.920
Oh, baby, baby, you must have misheard
me or misunderstood me.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.503
It was probably my fault.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.541
None of this happens
until you are dead.

09:14.986 --> 09:18.980
Stan, I want you to break off this
crazy arrangement with Dr. Penner.

09:19.297 --> 09:23.088
I'm not dead, and I don't like you
arranging my replacement as if I were!

09:23.212 --> 09:25.071
No. You're making
a big deal out of nothing.

09:25.196 --> 09:26.544
It's not nothing.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.389
Not to a woman at least.

09:28.623 --> 09:31.811
You think Dr. Penner's approaching this
as casually as you are?

09:31.936 --> 09:33.669
Probably.
She's pretty casual.

09:33.794 --> 09:35.706
She wears Crocs around the office.

09:36.411 --> 09:39.176
Look, Francine, they say men
who are happily married

09:39.301 --> 09:41.209
usually get remarried right away.

09:41.334 --> 09:44.130
So, this is actually
a huge compliment to you.

09:44.631 --> 09:46.569
There's your Valentine's Day
present.

09:46.694 --> 09:48.841
Your present is that observation.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.846
We know you were in the victim's room
on the day in question, Barry.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.227
This is the room
where I sleep in my house!

09:59.390 --> 10:00.656
Don't get smart with me!

10:00.926 --> 10:02.896
You wanna do this the hard way,
that's fine.

10:03.021 --> 10:04.363
I invented the hard way!

10:04.623 --> 10:06.959
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm playing bad cop.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.814
- You know, good cop/bad cop?
- Yeah, but I'm the bad cop.

10:09.939 --> 10:11.619
Roger, I'm the one in a wheelchair.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.838
I'm bitter about my fate
and constantly in pain

10:13.963 --> 10:16.418
from the one-eyed serial killer's
bullet lodged in my spine.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.492
I'm bad cop.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.381
No, no, your accident humbled you

10:20.506 --> 10:22.465
and made you grateful
for every day you're alive.

10:22.590 --> 10:24.206
- You're good cop.
- I'm bad cop!

10:24.331 --> 10:27.758
You don't have the guts! I can
bad cop better than you in my sleep.

10:30.843 --> 10:33.991
You wanna go to jail, double-stuff?
Oh, the boys'll love you in there.

10:34.116 --> 10:36.663
They won't leave
one fat fold unviolated.

10:38.851 --> 10:41.342
Still won't talk?
Maybe I'll reach out to a buddy of mine.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.901
Dirty Cop owes me a favor.

10:43.026 --> 10:45.786
In two hours, I can have
a dead baby stuffed with heroin

10:45.911 --> 10:49.521
planted in your mom's car.
Is that what you want, wide load?!

10:51.119 --> 10:53.619
- Put out your hands.
- I made heavy pants!

10:53.744 --> 10:55.541
I said put out your hands!

10:55.666 --> 10:57.822
You got real pretty hands, fat boy.

10:58.881 --> 11:00.626
Now I'm gonna make you eat 'em!

11:01.884 --> 11:02.967
God, Roger!

11:03.092 --> 11:05.272
All right, all right,
you can be bad cop.

11:05.397 --> 11:07.203
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.

11:07.328 --> 11:09.759
I confess!
I went in Hayley's room.

11:09.884 --> 11:12.207
I like to put her toothbrush
in my mouth.

11:12.332 --> 11:15.169
It tastes like mint,
and sometimes I find food.

11:15.381 --> 11:17.002
But what about Hayley's Shuffle?

11:17.423 --> 11:20.202
I don't know. I was just eating
toothbrush corn.

11:20.327 --> 11:21.917
Then the fish scared me away.

11:27.284 --> 11:28.497
Looking good!

11:28.952 --> 11:30.051
Doesn't she?

11:30.456 --> 11:33.023
- Jim! Wait, what are you doing here?
- Didn't I tell you?

11:33.147 --> 11:34.995
Can you get my back, J-dog?

11:35.307 --> 11:36.702
Jim's my backup husband.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.412
- What?!
- I'm honored.

11:38.537 --> 11:40.664
I mean, be sleeping
with your wife someday.

11:40.789 --> 11:43.019
That makes us, like,
brothers or something.

11:43.144 --> 11:46.741
- Would you excuse us for a minute, Jim?
- Sure, I'll just go do my tai-chi.

11:49.391 --> 11:50.864
I see what you're doing here,

11:50.989 --> 11:54.112
but I never laid around the pool
having Meg Penner rub lotion on me.

11:54.312 --> 11:57.343
No, you just laid around her office
for the last ten years,

11:57.468 --> 11:59.428
letting her fingers in your mouth.

11:59.683 --> 12:01.818
I'm just making up for lost time.

12:07.628 --> 12:09.325
I know why you're upset.

12:09.623 --> 12:12.213
Baby, none of this
happens till you're dead.

12:12.821 --> 12:15.271
Oh, God! Jim,
your niece's piano recital!

12:16.270 --> 12:18.317
Grab the cupcakes and let's go!

12:25.034 --> 12:28.379
Damn! Did you see what homeboy
was packing in his Speedo?

12:28.653 --> 12:30.218
I mean, I can't relax.

12:30.343 --> 12:32.597
I'm in an inner tube, in a pool,

12:32.722 --> 12:34.943
with a drink and I can't get right.

12:35.068 --> 12:36.814
Reginald, what are you doing here?

12:36.939 --> 12:39.186
I just got back from a CIA mission.

12:39.429 --> 12:42.175
'Cause, you know,
sometimes I be on missions.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.914
Sometimes I just be
hanging out here at the house.

12:45.039 --> 12:46.383
But more importantly,

12:46.508 --> 12:50.160
what's up with Prince Walnuts
rubbing lotion on your wife?

12:50.633 --> 12:52.218
You better handle your business.

12:52.343 --> 12:54.820
Yeah, I guess I got to break up
with Meg Penner tomorrow.

12:55.510 --> 12:57.189
It's probably for the best.

12:57.314 --> 12:59.432
Man, I hate ending relationships.

12:59.557 --> 13:01.558
It took me six months
to fire the gardener

13:01.683 --> 13:04.483
after I found out he was taking pictures
of Steve while he was asleep.

13:04.608 --> 13:06.349
You know, I didn't hear a word you said.

13:06.474 --> 13:09.464
I'm still thinking
about Johnny Snowglobes over there.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.686
I mean, is that even attractive?

13:12.147 --> 13:16.065
Like, is it something you advertise,
or something you just keep to yourself?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.288
For the last time,
I wasn't in Hayley's room.

13:21.490 --> 13:24.911
I was here, reading a great new article
about hip dysplasia.

13:25.124 --> 13:26.438
Barry says different,

13:26.562 --> 13:29.385
which means, something
about your story seems...

13:29.967 --> 13:30.822
fishy.

13:30.947 --> 13:32.396
- What was that?
- A wisecrack.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.140
- I'm cracking wise.
- No way!

13:34.265 --> 13:36.788
You can't be bad cop
and do the wisecracks.

13:36.913 --> 13:38.447
I'm doing the wisecracks!

13:39.310 --> 13:43.115
Klaus, you're going to face
the scales of Lady Justice.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.482
We know you're gill-ty.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.724
Like it or not, fish,
you're on the hook for this one.

13:48.849 --> 13:51.739
Your days of crime are H2 over!

13:51.863 --> 13:54.142
- That doesn't even make sense!
- Fish live in water!

13:54.317 --> 13:55.316
Enough!

13:55.700 --> 13:58.232
I confess.
Just, please, no more puns.

13:58.477 --> 13:59.628
I knew he was lying!

13:59.752 --> 14:02.438
There hasn't been a good article
on hip dysplasia in years.

14:02.682 --> 14:04.487
Look, I did go into Hayley's room.

14:04.612 --> 14:07.603
I use her toothbrush to scrape algae
from the inside of my bowl.

14:08.895 --> 14:10.792
But I didn't steal anything.

14:11.206 --> 14:12.351
Is that a red hair?

14:12.608 --> 14:15.744
<i>Ja. I've been tangled in it
since I was in Hayley's room.</i>

14:17.013 --> 14:18.259
We found our next clue.

14:18.384 --> 14:21.705
Looks like this case
is getting a little hairy.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.410
You proud of that?

14:24.535 --> 14:26.720
You proud of that sentence
you just said?

14:31.032 --> 14:33.120
What are you doing here?
You have an appointment?

14:33.245 --> 14:35.885
No, but you're about
to have a disappointment.

14:36.159 --> 14:39.049
Meg, I've got to break things off.
You can't be my backup wife.

14:39.323 --> 14:40.755
What? That?

14:40.879 --> 14:43.755
For heaven's sakes, I thought
that was some kind of a joke.

14:44.137 --> 14:46.421
And the ego goes into defense mode.

14:48.544 --> 14:50.538
Amazing how the human brain
works, isn't it?

14:51.830 --> 14:53.168
She keeps saying my name.

14:53.803 --> 14:54.963
You got it bad, Meg.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.334
You just need to turn around
and walk away.

14:57.555 --> 14:58.834
But this is my office.

14:59.170 --> 15:01.193
Good, good, throw yourself
into your work.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.560
Now, listen, I'm going to leave,
but...

15:03.685 --> 15:05.196
these little love notes?

15:05.773 --> 15:07.054
Meg, no more of these.

15:07.303 --> 15:10.412
That's an appointment card.
I send them to all my patients.

15:14.591 --> 15:17.144
Now I know it won't be easy,
but try to forget about me.

15:17.269 --> 15:19.515
Do something nice for yourself.
Get a massage.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.687
Go have salad with the girls...

15:22.130 --> 15:25.496
But if you just can't stop thinking
about this gorgeous mug...

15:25.621 --> 15:27.224
Well, maybe this will help.

15:30.355 --> 15:31.363
You're welcome!

15:34.096 --> 15:37.134
So, since I went ahead and broke up
with my backup wife,

15:37.258 --> 15:38.642
you don't need to carry on

15:38.767 --> 15:41.386
with Francine's little backup
husband revenge thing!

15:41.511 --> 15:44.456
You mean, just pretend
like this never happened?

15:44.689 --> 15:47.689
- Right!
- That's a big emotional negatory!

15:47.931 --> 15:50.177
- I'm sorry?
- No can do!

15:50.602 --> 15:52.517
I'm in love with your wife!

15:52.914 --> 15:53.738
What?!

15:53.862 --> 15:56.278
She's sexy! She's funny!

15:56.403 --> 15:58.001
My niece loves her...!

15:58.896 --> 16:01.264
My niece is very important to me!

16:01.529 --> 16:04.183
Jim, I'm sorry,
but she's a happily married...

16:07.292 --> 16:08.609
Not anymore!

16:09.919 --> 16:10.866
What the fuck!

16:14.945 --> 16:17.218
You lost your damn mind, Jim?

16:17.343 --> 16:18.541
That was Stan!

16:18.836 --> 16:20.384
You just killed Stan!

16:23.557 --> 16:25.193
All right.
What's done is done.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.626
Can't change it now.

16:26.751 --> 16:28.742
Reggie's just got to keep moving.

16:35.163 --> 16:38.768
And so, on behalf of the Guinness Book
of World Records,

16:38.893 --> 16:41.165
I, Lady Carolyn Gilbert-Lawson,

16:41.290 --> 16:45.296
congratulate Achmed Asadi
for making the world's biggest falafel.

16:52.436 --> 16:53.706
You're a fraud, Asadi!

16:54.044 --> 16:56.141
I just wanted to impress Zamira!

16:56.299 --> 16:57.871
She is so beautiful!

17:05.876 --> 17:08.750
Hey, lady, is that your hot air balloon?
I need a ride back to the States.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.656
I'm sorry, but that balloon
is for official Guinness business only.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.675
What if I told you
we'd set the record

17:14.799 --> 17:17.196
for "Most Spontaneous Cross Atlantic
Hot Air Balloon Trip"?

17:17.507 --> 17:19.273
I'm sorry, sir, I can't...

17:19.398 --> 17:21.263
What if I told you
I'm about to set the record

17:21.388 --> 17:23.684
for shooting a woman in the face
the most times in a row?

17:23.809 --> 17:26.419
Alejandro, fire up the balloon!

17:32.621 --> 17:35.671
Hayley, we worked all day,
and we finally figured everything out.

17:35.796 --> 17:37.617
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm good cop,

17:37.742 --> 17:38.911
pos(192,230)and Roger's bad cop.

17:39.036 --> 17:40.351
pos(192,230)I make the wisecracks,

17:40.476 --> 17:43.211
pos(192,230)but Roger can be sarcastic,
as long as it's not too schticky.

17:43.336 --> 17:46.075
pos(192,230)I get to have the troubled past,
but Steve always gets the girl.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.911
Unless she's a bad guy,
in which case, Roger gets her,

17:49.036 --> 17:51.954
so she can betray him, leading to
a gunfight on the roof of an opera house.

17:52.079 --> 17:53.516
- Or a theater.
- Or a theater.

17:53.742 --> 17:56.301
What the hell are you talking about?
Where's my Shuffle?

17:56.426 --> 17:58.746
- Your what now?
- That was the whole point of this.

17:58.871 --> 18:01.763
You were supposed to find
my iPod Shuffle, rember?

18:02.028 --> 18:03.650
Is that what a Shuffle is?

18:03.775 --> 18:06.392
- I did not realize. Yeah, I took that.
- What?

18:06.517 --> 18:10.123
I was in Hayley's her room, using her toothbrush
to scrub the bird poo out of my red wig.

18:10.248 --> 18:12.544
What? Oh, God, I'm going to be sick.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.930
Can I finish my story, please?

18:15.055 --> 18:16.957
Anyway, I took your iPod
from the dresser

18:17.082 --> 18:18.747
for a variety of complex reasons,

18:18.872 --> 18:20.839
the most important of which
was that it was shiny.

18:21.444 --> 18:23.812
I erased all your music
and filled it with ABBA.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.895
Don't really care for them,
but I did it anyway.

18:26.020 --> 18:29.011
So that explains the red hair
we found in Klaus's bowl.

18:29.135 --> 18:31.917
I guess it wasn't just
a red hair-ing!

18:32.041 --> 18:33.334
Nice pun work, Wheels.

18:33.502 --> 18:34.619
Thanks, Legman.

18:34.744 --> 18:36.675
The puns are there in the marble.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.854
- I just have to chisel them out.
- Free them from the marble.

18:41.943 --> 18:42.997
You need something?

18:46.842 --> 18:49.464
Thanks.
Why do you travel like this, Alejandro?

18:49.589 --> 18:50.827
I'll tell you why, Stan.

18:52.335 --> 18:55.601
Will you put me in the record book
as the happiest man alive

18:55.726 --> 18:59.017
by becoming Mrs. Lady Carolyn
Gilbert Lawson-Rojas?

18:59.359 --> 19:00.418
Yes, Alejandro!

19:00.543 --> 19:02.041
A million times yes!

19:10.615 --> 19:11.429
You!

19:27.282 --> 19:28.896
Francine, help!

19:29.825 --> 19:32.478
I'm dealing with
a little problem of my own.

19:34.997 --> 19:37.182
- What are you doing?
- We're going to be together.

19:37.307 --> 19:38.726
Like we planned.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.808
No, we broke up, remember?

19:42.230 --> 19:43.441
I know. No, I know.

19:43.565 --> 19:45.843
Look, I really tried
to play it cool, but...

19:45.968 --> 19:48.115
But the truth is, you were right.

19:48.461 --> 19:49.459
I love you.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.262
And my heart has a cavity
that only you can fill!

19:53.072 --> 19:54.319
That is clever...

19:54.444 --> 19:56.159
and super-crazy.

19:58.868 --> 20:00.915
Stan, this is all my fault.

20:03.104 --> 20:06.669
I was jealous,
so I tried to make you jealous.

20:08.339 --> 20:10.532
No, it's my fault.

20:10.689 --> 20:13.081
There's a lot of things
you should make backup plans for,

20:13.206 --> 20:15.196
but love isn't one of them.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.303
Stan, that's beautiful.

20:27.132 --> 20:27.957
My tooth!

20:28.233 --> 20:29.706
I can put a crown on for you.

20:29.874 --> 20:31.583
I'm not going to you anymore.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.621
Good luck getting
your x-rays back, bitch!

20:38.150 --> 20:40.494
Nobody shoots my backup husband.

20:41.312 --> 20:43.909
Meg, you saved my life!
I love you!

20:54.428 --> 20:55.553
Just, just...

20:56.943 --> 20:59.312
- Did we just find another case?
- Are you kidding me?

20:59.437 --> 21:00.556
This is gruesome.

21:00.681 --> 21:02.616
This is like a cable crime.
We're network.

21:02.741 --> 21:05.045
- Yeah, no one dies on our show.
- Right.

21:05.169 --> 21:07.727
Let's face it:
On our darkest day, we're Scooby-Doo.

21:07.852 --> 21:09.153
Maybe Quincy.
