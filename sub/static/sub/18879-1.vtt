Shakespeare in Love...

05:25.880 --> 05:28.793
I mean, we could not
believe what was happening.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.635
And I swear to God, she was wrecked.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.996
She was completely wrecked!

05:35.080 --> 05:40.678
I know. I know, it was pure insanity.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.956
It's insanity...

05:43.040 --> 05:44.394
Ah!

05:44.480 --> 05:47.757
"Lunacy! It was pure lunacy."

05:57.760 --> 05:59.638
What is his prob... I should go.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.400
Cappuccino, please.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.472
- Right. Of course.
- On us.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.353
Oh, no, thank you. I insist.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.394
Did you see who that was?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.189
Shit!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.519
- Mia, where do you think you're going?
- Oh, it's five after.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.671
- You better be here early tomorrow.
- Okay.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.634
Have a good night!

06:55.720 --> 06:56.756
Oh!

07:09.680 --> 07:14.152
She was wrecked!
It was pure lunacy, it was...

07:14.240 --> 07:18.632
It was so crazy, and I just...
Oh, you would have died.

07:20.520 --> 07:25.231
No, Turner's fine.
Turner's fine. I just, um...

07:25.320 --> 07:28.438
Are you gonna wait 'til Denver
to tell her, or...?

07:32.040 --> 07:33.030
What?

07:42.680 --> 07:43.909
Okay.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.354
No, I'm happy for you.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.873
I am. I'm happy for you, I just...

07:58.360 --> 08:00.033
I just thought...

08:03.400 --> 08:04.470
I don't know what I thought,

08:04.560 --> 08:06.279
- I guess I thought...
- One second.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.880
- What, Ruby?
- Jessica's on the phone.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.556
- Um, tell her I'll call her back.
- In two minutes?

08:14.680 --> 08:16.797
- Less than two minutes.
- I'll go get your lunch.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.553
I'm almost done. Thank you.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.316
Oh, you know what? I think we're good.
Thanks for coming in.

09:34.320 --> 09:38.075
Whoa! Holy shit! You wanna open a window?

09:38.160 --> 09:41.039
- I was trying to give you an entrance.
- Thank you.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.998
Mia! How'd the audition go?

09:44.080 --> 09:45.116
Eh.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.590
Eh, same here. Was Jen there or Rachel?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.149
- I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
- They're the worst.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.358
- Well, I don't know if they were there.
- I bet that they were.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.000
Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

09:56.480 --> 09:59.279
Two minutes, people.
Mia, you're coming, right?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.591
I can't! I'm working.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.400
What?

10:03.840 --> 10:06.071
Did she just say "working"?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.158
- What?
- I'm sorry it didn't go well today,

10:09.240 --> 10:11.391
and there's like four things in my inbox
that you're perfect for,

10:11.480 --> 10:14.393
and I will submit you.
But right now you're coming!

10:14.480 --> 10:15.755
It'll be fun.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.593
- It's not gonna be fun.
- It could be.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.110
It's not. It's gonna be
a bunch of social climbers

10:20.200 --> 10:22.715
all packed into one of those
big glass houses.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.120
This looks familiar.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.715
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.757
- A long time.
- Come on, Mia.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.069
When else are you gonna get to see

10:30.160 --> 10:32.152
every Hollywood cliché crammed
into the same room?

10:32.240 --> 10:33.754
We'll make fun of it together!

10:33.840 --> 10:36.992
I'm disappointed in you, Lex.
There's nothing to make fun of.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.869

Ahh!

18:17.760 --> 18:19.558
Please stop sneaking into my home.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.313
You think Mom or Dad
would call this a home?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.675
What are you doing?

18:22.760 --> 18:24.433
Please don't do that.
Please don't sit on that.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.556
Are you kidding?

18:25.640 --> 18:26.835
Please don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.320
Don't sit on that.
Hoagy Carmichael sat on that!

18:28.400 --> 18:30.710
- Oh, my God!
- "The Baked Potato" just threw it away.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.395
- I can't imagine why.
- And now you're just sitting on it.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.597
- I got you a throw rug.
- I don't need that.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.479
What if I said Miles Davis pissed on it?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.632
It's almost insulting. Is it true?

18:41.720 --> 18:44.360
When are you gonna unpack these boxes?

18:44.440 --> 18:46.113
When I unpack them in my own club.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.716
Oh, Sebastian! It's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.393
You're not still going by there, are you?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.237
That's...

18:54.360 --> 18:56.511
You won't believe it.
They turned it into a samba-tapas place.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.638
- Oh, my God, Sebastian!
- Samba. Tapas.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.755
Pick one, you know? Do one right.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.390
- I have someone I want you to meet.
- I don't wanna meet anyone.

19:06.800 --> 19:07.790
No, no, I don't wanna meet anyone.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.270
- Dad gave you this? You'll like her.
- Yes.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.716
I don't think I'm gonna like her.
Does she like jazz?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.712
- Probably not.
- Then what are we gonna talk about?

19:14.840 --> 19:16.672
I don't know! It doesn't matter, okay?

19:16.800 --> 19:19.838
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

19:19.920 --> 19:21.240
- "It doesn't matter"?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.800
- Okay. Well then,
- You need to get serious.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.360
I know a guy with a face tattoo
that you should see.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.510
- Okay, low blow.
- Heart of gold.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.871
- Get serious!
- "Get serious"?

19:27.960 --> 19:32.159
Laura... I had a very serious plan
for my future.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.391
- I know.
- It's not my fault I got shanghaied.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.632
You didn't get shanghaied.
You got ripped off!

19:37.720 --> 19:38.870
What's the difference?

19:38.960 --> 19:42.192
I don't know.
It's not as romantic as that.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.350
Don't sit...

19:44.400 --> 19:47.120
Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.596
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

19:51.680 --> 19:55.515
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.875
I'm not gonna call her.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.280
And the thing is...

19:58.360 --> 20:00.556
you're acting like life's got me
on the ropes.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.280
I want to be on the ropes. Okay?

20:03.360 --> 20:04.919
I'm letting life hit me
'til it gets tired.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.310
- Oh?
- Then I'm gonna hit back.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.153
It's a classic rope-a-dope.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.478
Okay, Ali. I love you. Unpack your boxes.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.120
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.194
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.750
Hey.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.309
- Bill. Thanks for having me back.
- You're welcome.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.993
I want you to know you're lookin'
at a new man,

21:13.080 --> 21:15.197
- a man that's happy to be here.
- Good. Excellent.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.352
- Very-easy-to-work-with man.
- And you're going to play the set list?

21:18.440 --> 21:19.840
Happy to.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.640
Even though I don't think anyone cares
what I play, but, yeah.

21:22.760 --> 21:26.276
Well, if by "anyone" you mean anyone
other than me, that would be correct.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.238
I care, and I don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.437
Right. Okay.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.113
Although I thought in this town

21:32.200 --> 21:35.272
it worked on a sort of
"one for you, one for me" type system.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.917
How 'bout two for you, one for me?

21:38.920 --> 21:40.639
How 'bout all for you and none for me?

21:40.720 --> 21:42.120
- That's perfect, yes.
- Great.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.759
- Okay.
- Mutual decision, then.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.320
Right. Made by me.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.596
Right. And I sign off on it, so...

21:47.680 --> 21:50.434
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.637
Well. Welcome back.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.872
There's a nice way to say that, Karen.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.320
Seb.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.115
I hear what you're saying,

25:14.240 --> 25:15.879
but I don't think you're saying
what you mean.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.872
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.156
Well, that's what you're saying,
but it's not what you mean.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.471
- What you mean is...
- You're fired.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.792
- "Play the set list."
- No, I'm saying it's too late.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.475
- It's a warning.
- What planet are you from?

25:28.560 --> 25:31.519
- Don't fire me, Bill. Don't fire me.
- You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.875
It's Christmas.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.078
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the new year.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.589
I just heard you play, and I wanted to...

26:06.720 --> 26:11.670
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?

26:11.760 --> 26:15.356
DOA on 23rd. Perp laughin'
his face off at the PD.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.840
Damn Miranda rights.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.957
This is my classroom.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.918
You don't like it, the door's to my left.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.992
Lady, why you be trippin' like that?

26:24.080 --> 26:28.472
No, Jamal. You be trippin'.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.994
Over here!

26:42.640 --> 26:45.439
We're talking away

26:45.520 --> 26:48.831
I don't know what I'm to say,
I'll say it anyway...

26:48.960 --> 26:50.474
Oh, Mia!

26:50.560 --> 26:52.597
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.399
- I want you to meet my friend, Carlo.
- Hi.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.596
- Hi. Carlo.
- Carlo, this is Mia.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.751
- Mia? Hi. How are you?
- Yes, Mia.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.399
Carlo is a writer.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.358
Yeah. They say I have a knack
for world-building.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.715
I got a lot of heat right now.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.156
There's been a lot of buzz, people talkin'
about me, which is exciting.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.072
I mean, you work so hard,
and then all that validation.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.833
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Okay.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.798
Yeah, it's really nice to meet you.

All right, piano man,

And I'll admit
I was a little curt that night.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.670
Curt?

29:35.760 --> 29:37.638
Okay, I was an asshole. I can admit that.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.710
Okay.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.032
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician, it's just... it's too far.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.750
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.991
- I don't think so.
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.833
- Why?
- 'Cause I have an audition next week.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.912
I'm playing a "serious" firefighter.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.992
So you're an actress.
I thought you looked familiar.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.719
Have I seen you in anything?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.838
Uh... coffee shop
on the Warner Brothers lot.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.036
That's a classic.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.873
- Oh, I see. You're a barista.
- Yeah.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.032
And I can see how you could then
look down on me from all the way up there.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.112
Time to... next set.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.876
He doesn't... I don't...
he doesn't tell me what to do.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.360
He just told you what to do.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.319
I know. I let him. What's your name?

30:16.400 --> 30:17.436
- Mia.
- Mia.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.478
Guess I'll see you in the movies.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.911
- You heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh, yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.435
I have this idea to do a re-imagining
of Goldilocks and The Three Bears,

30:28.520 --> 30:30.079
but from the perspective of the bears.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.038
- The hero's journey.
- It could be like a franchise.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.110
- Right.
- There's a lot we don't know.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.873
There could have been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.320
George Michael!

30:41.880 --> 30:43.030
Hello.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.315
- Sorry, it's...
- Yeah, yeah.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.596
I know that guy. Did you get your keys?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.679
Mmm-hmm, yes.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.991
- Can you grab mine?
- Can I what?

30:53.120 --> 30:54.554
Would you be able to grab mine? My keys?

30:54.640 --> 30:55.790
- I can't, your...
- Sorry.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.315
- Can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.989
- Please?
- Oh, there we go.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.878
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.117
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.120
I mean, that doesn't help me.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.874
- With a green ribbon.
- All right.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.993
- Those look, uh, comfortable.
- They are.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.751
Thank you for saving the day back there.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.799
Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.799
It's pretty strange that we keep running
into each other.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.553
It is strange.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.030
Maybe it means something.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.156
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.879
Where's my car?

31:40.600 --> 31:42.592
You gotta put that thing to your chin.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.080
- This?
- Yeah.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.833
Yeah, it makes your head
into an antenna, so...

31:46.920 --> 31:48.195
- Ooh.
- I think it gives you cancer,

31:48.280 --> 31:50.078
- but you find your car faster.
- What?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.914
You don't live as long, but you get where
you're going quicker, so it all evens out.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.514
That sounds terrible.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.200
- Just a suggestion.
- You're a...

31:57.280 --> 32:00.034
You're a real, um...
what's the word I'm looking for?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.713
"Knight in shining armor"?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.838
- Weirdo. That was the word. Weirdo.
- Okay.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.040
Not much to look at, huh?

32:14.080 --> 32:15.673
I've seen better.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.830
Yeah. Be there soon. Okay, bye.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.912
- It was just right there.
- Just right here.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.154
Do you want a ride to your car?

36:57.240 --> 36:59.516
No, I'm just right up here.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.673
Good night.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.070
Good night.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.076
Excuse me. This is gluten-free, right?

38:27.120 --> 38:28.998
- No.
- What?

38:29.080 --> 38:30.560
Mmm-mmm.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.393
Ugh! I'd like a refund.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.999
Okay. Let me check on that for you.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.276
Mia...

38:39.360 --> 38:41.875
- Hi.
- You're closing Friday.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.600
I can't close on Friday.
I have an audition, remember?

38:44.680 --> 38:46.990
Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.152
Oh, and we need to have a little talk
tomorrow, okay?

38:50.240 --> 38:51.959
Fix your apron, please.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.269
Okay.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.474
You again!

39:01.240 --> 39:02.515
What are you doing here?

39:02.600 --> 39:05.832
Oh, you know, just meetings
and... studio heads and...

39:05.920 --> 39:07.274
How'd you get on the lot?

39:07.360 --> 39:10.910
I basically just hauled ass
past the guard gates.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.310
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.519
You don't have a break coming up, do you?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.398
I'm off in ten minutes, so...

39:18.840 --> 39:20.194
Can I hide in the bathroom?

39:20.280 --> 39:22.431
- Yes.
- Okay.

39:23.640 --> 39:24.915
Sorry.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.959
Um... I actually do have to check.
I'm sorry.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.675
That's the window that Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman

39:34.760 --> 39:35.876
looked out of in Casablanca.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.155
- Wow!
- Yeah.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.152
I can't believe you work
right across the street from that.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.993
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.869
What was your Bogart's name?

39:44.960 --> 39:47.156
What's his name? Is it Greg?

39:47.280 --> 39:49.272
Yeah. Greg.

39:49.360 --> 39:52.159
Right. How long have you been...

39:52.240 --> 39:53.993
We've been seeing each other
for about a month.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.679
Oh, that's great.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.080
He's, um... He's sweet.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.231
Anyway, I love
being around this stuff, you know?

39:59.320 --> 40:00.310
I know what you mean.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.632
I get coffee five miles out of the way
just so I can be near a jazz club.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.200
- Really?
- Yeah, the Van Beek.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.350
- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.878
All the big swing bands used to play
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.350
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

40:14.880 --> 40:16.200
What's a samba-tapas place?

40:16.280 --> 40:18.749
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.117
- Oh.
- Yeah, so the joke's on... history?

40:22.200 --> 40:23.475
I don't know. That's L.A.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.236
They just worship everything
and they value nothing.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.716
We're about to roll. Stop, please, guys.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.916
Okay.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.559
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.996
I know. They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so I know about movies.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.275
- Come this way.
- Great.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.670
It's a lock-down.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.717
- I love her!
- And here we go.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.712
Hey! How'd you get into all this?

40:42.800 --> 40:44.234
And roll!

40:44.320 --> 40:45.720
- Get into what?
- Sound speed!

40:45.800 --> 40:47.314
You know, movies, acting...

40:47.400 --> 40:49.392
- Action!
- Oh, um...

40:49.480 --> 40:52.314
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.756
She was in a traveling theater company.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.036
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.715
So across the street from my house
there was this little library

40:59.800 --> 41:01.393
that had an old movie section.

41:01.520 --> 41:05.912
So she took me and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies

41:06.000 --> 41:10.040
like Notorious and Bringing Up Baby
and Casablanca.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.554
- And...
- Cut it there! Cut!

41:11.640 --> 41:13.677
- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.592
- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.

41:15.680 --> 41:18.275
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom,

41:18.360 --> 41:23.594
and it would basically just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes from the movies.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.080
And then I would write my own plays.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.719
- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.473
I love it.

41:53.640 --> 41:56.678
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here

41:56.760 --> 41:59.594
and my last audition was for a teen show

41:59.680 --> 42:01.831
pitched as
"Dangerous Minds meets The O.C."

42:01.920 --> 42:05.994
So, yeah, should've been a lawyer.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.992
'Cause the world needs more lawyers.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.196
It doesn't need more actresses.

42:10.280 --> 42:11.680
You're not just an actress.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.355
- What do you mean, "just an actress"?
- You said it yourself.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.875
You're a child prodigy playwright.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.394
That is not what I said.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.996
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.833
You could just write
your own roles, you know?

42:23.920 --> 42:25.798
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

42:25.880 --> 42:27.314
and you don't have to audition for this...

42:27.440 --> 42:28.760
- uh, piece of caca.
- Yeah.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.240
Look at Louis Armstrong.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.000
He could've just played the marching band
charts that he was given.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.799
But he didn't do it. What did he do?

42:34.880 --> 42:37.952
- What did he do?
- Well, he made history, didn't he?

42:38.320 --> 42:41.279
Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning
and I'm gonna make history instead.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.954
Well, my work is done here.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.272
I should probably tell you something now,
just to get it out of the way.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.589
- Mmm-hmm?
- I hate jazz.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.550
Are you okay?

42:54.640 --> 42:56.916
What do you mean, you hate jazz?

42:57.000 --> 42:58.753
It just means that when I listen to it,
I don't like it.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.753
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement
you don't like jazz.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.069
What are you doing right now?

43:04.440 --> 43:05.840
Nothing.

43:22.720 --> 43:25.474
I just think that people,
when they say that they...

43:26.520 --> 43:30.036
you know, hate jazz, they just...

43:30.120 --> 43:33.955
They don't have context, they don't know
where it comes from.

43:34.040 --> 43:37.670
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,

43:37.800 --> 43:39.712
and it's just because people
were crammed in there,

43:39.800 --> 43:42.360
they spoke five different languages,
they couldn't talk to each other.

43:42.440 --> 43:46.229
The only way they could communicate
was with jazz.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.720
Yeah, but what about Kenny G?

43:49.200 --> 43:51.032
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.952
I mean, what about elevator music?

43:53.040 --> 43:55.509
You know, jazz music that I know?

43:55.600 --> 43:57.353
- What about it?
- From my life?

43:57.440 --> 43:59.750
- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.230
It's not relaxing. It's not, it's not.

44:02.320 --> 44:05.438
Sidney Bechet shot somebody because
they told him he played a wrong note.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.749
That's hardly relaxing.

44:06.840 --> 44:11.039
Yeah, but where I grew up there was
this station called K-Jazz 103.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.954
And people would just put on that station
when they had a cocktail party...

44:14.040 --> 44:15.269
Right.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.511
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.590
I know.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.114
- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob...

44:20.200 --> 44:22.556
Okay, okay. So I think
that's part of the problem,

44:22.680 --> 44:24.433
is that you can't hear it, you know?
You have to see it.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.796
You have to see what's at stake.
I mean, look at these fellas.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.156
Look at the sax player right now.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.471
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.

44:31.560 --> 44:33.153
Every one of these guys is composing,

44:33.240 --> 44:34.959
they're rearranging, they're writing.

44:35.040 --> 44:36.554
Then they're playing the melody.
They're just...

44:36.640 --> 44:37.994
And now look, the trumpet player.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.560
He's got his own idea.

44:39.640 --> 44:44.157
And so, it's conflict,
and it's compromise, and it's just...

44:44.240 --> 44:45.594
It's new every time.

44:45.680 --> 44:49.151
It's brand-new every night.
It's very, very exciting.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.712
And it's dying. It's dying, Mia.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.274
It's dying on the vine.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.671
And the world says, "Let it die.
It had its time."

45:04.760 --> 45:06.558
Well, not on my watch.

45:07.920 --> 45:11.436
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna have my own club.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.119
- Really?
- Yes.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.999
We're gonna play whatever we want,
whenever we want,

45:16.080 --> 45:20.313
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.669
Hi, this is Mia Dolan.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.194
Yeah, I just missed a call.

45:32.320 --> 45:36.519
- I got a callback!
- What? Come on! For what?

45:36.600 --> 45:39.638
For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.916
- The "Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
- Yeah.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.231
- Congratulations! That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.312
I feel like I said negative stuff
about it before.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.119
- What?
- It's like Rebel Without a Cause.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.270
Sort of.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.637
"I got the bullets!"

45:51.720 --> 45:53.518
Yes.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.112
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.874
Oh, my! You know,
it's playing at the Rialto.

45:58.960 --> 46:00.076
- Really?
- Yes.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.631
You should go... I mean, I can take you.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.710
Okay.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.234
- You know, for research.
- For research.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.152
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.391
Um, Monday night, 10:00 o'clock.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.278
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.714
For research.

In your own time.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.195
Okay.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.600
Two options.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.990
You either follow my rules
or follow my rules.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.309
- Capisce?
- Thank you.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.870
- Oh...
- Thanks.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.189
I can do it a different way.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.670
No, that's fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.550
- That was fun. Thanks.
- Bye.

49:29.640 --> 49:31.518
Oh, hey, Mia?

49:31.600 --> 49:33.592
- Hey.
- Greg's here.

49:33.680 --> 49:37.674
- What do you mean...
- Hey, babe. Got a space out front.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.479
- Great.
- We should get going.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.119
- Okay.
- My brother landed really early.

49:44.120 --> 49:46.760
- Did you forget? You forgot.
- Shit.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.559
That's tonight.

49:48.640 --> 49:50.950
- That's okay. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.440
All right, so then I'll just get changed.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.989
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.795
- Yeah, that's him.
- Um...

49:58.880 --> 50:00.633
Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...

50:00.720 --> 50:03.713
Just pickin' up Mia.
We'll be there in, like...

50:04.760 --> 50:07.150
But now we've got this
surround-sound set-up, so it's like...

50:07.240 --> 50:09.596
- It's like being in a movie theater.
- Wow.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.080
But better than being
in a theater, really.

50:11.160 --> 50:13.038
- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.952
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.440
Yeah, I know. And smelly.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.079
And they're either too hot or too cold.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.839
I know. The quality's really fallen off.

50:19.920 --> 50:22.355
The quality's terrible.
And there's always people talking.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.954
- Because...
- Which is just... Oh, it's the worst!

50:24.080 --> 50:27.232
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on one second.
- The texting.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.230
Hello?

50:29.320 --> 50:30.879
- Probably work.
- Mmm.

50:36.760 --> 50:39.753
- Sorry. So, yeah, we love it.
- Oh, it's so nice.

50:39.840 --> 50:43.880
- Well, we have to come. Maybe.
- You should. Come by.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.513
- I got one word for you, man.
- Mmm-hmm?

51:02.600 --> 51:05.832
- Indonesia.
- Never heard anyone say that.

51:05.920 --> 51:09.038
I don't even know. I can't keep track
of it, but honestly, it was life-changing.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.351
- Really?
- Yeah. It affected me.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.955
- It was incredible.
- Is it amazing?

51:14.040 --> 51:16.236
- Yes.
- A five-star jungle eco-resort

51:16.320 --> 51:18.118
- you would not believe.
- Amazing.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.520
We were thinking about Nicaragua.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.354
The thing about Nicaragua is it's less
developed, it's a little under-developed.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.430
Right.

51:23.520 --> 51:27.196
I think there's a little more... Yeah,
then, I just don't know if it's safe.

51:27.280 --> 51:28.953
- Yeah, yeah. It's...
- You know?

51:29.040 --> 51:30.156
Yeah, you don't want to explore too far.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.754
Kind of a "natives are restless"
sort of thing.

51:33.120 --> 51:36.796
Actually, China's going to build a canal.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.120
I'm sorry.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.956
...the immensity of our universe.

53:39.040 --> 53:41.839
For many days before the end of our earth,

53:41.920 --> 53:43.639
people will look into the night sky

53:43.720 --> 53:48.237
and notice a star increasingly bright
and increasingly near.

53:48.320 --> 53:50.710
As this star approaches us...

53:52.120 --> 53:54.510
Jim Stark.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.398
I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.960
As this star approaches us,

53:58.040 --> 53:59.952
the weather will change.

54:00.040 --> 54:04.193
The great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide,

54:04.280 --> 54:07.318
and the seas will turn warm.

54:07.400 --> 54:10.632
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed,

54:10.720 --> 54:13.554
for the stars will still be there
and will be...

54:26.360 --> 54:27.589
Mmm...

54:31.040 --> 54:33.077
I have an idea.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.438
What is that? Is it a script?

59:09.520 --> 59:10.920
It's a play.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.834
A play? You better give us all roles!

59:13.920 --> 59:17.755
Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So I can't.

59:22.680 --> 59:25.559
Wow. Is that gonna happen every time?

59:25.640 --> 59:27.279
I think so.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.477
Ahh! It's one-way!

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.352
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.319
Oh!

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.040
Sebastian?

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.835
Keith.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.320
Come here, man.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.913
- How are you?
- I've been good, man.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.753
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.069
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.720
- Nice to meet you.
- I used to play with this guy.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.393
Went to school together.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.119
- So how you been, brother?
- Great.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.634
Never been better. How 'bout you?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.473
I been really good. Been very busy.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.029
- I got a new combo.
- Okay. Cool.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.554
We're lookin' for keys.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.475
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.438
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure? It pays.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.279
I'm good.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.636
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.995
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.480
Nice to meet you.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.674
"The end."

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.632
- Genius.
- Really?

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.359
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.669
It feels really nostalgic to me.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.194
- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point. That's...

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.710
Are people gonna like it?

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.360
- Fuck 'em.
- You always say that.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.116
- Well, I truly believe it.
- I made you something.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.840
- For what?
- For your club.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.995
Why does it say "Seb's"?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.639
'Cause I think you should call it "Seb's."

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.710
- What?
- 'Cause no one will come

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.399
to "Chicken on a Stick."

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.392
Is that a music note as an apostrophe?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.755
- Yes! Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.957
It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick,"

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.872
because Charlie Parker got his nickname...

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.270
I know, because he loved chicken.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.590
That's why they called him "Bird."

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.434
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer, jazz.
"Chicken on a Stick."

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.797
I know. You should drop the chicken
and just have drinks and jazz, and also...

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.952
- I'm not droppin' the chicken.
- You could maybe do it somewhere else.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.315
- What are you talk...
- Find a new spot.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.834
It's gotta be the Van Beek.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.240
Well, it doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.755
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.752
I can't do it.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.676
- You can let them, but you refuse to.
- Your play's incredible.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.959
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.033
What else do they want? Who's doing that?

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.311
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.633
Who was that guy at The Lighthouse?
The guy that offered you the gig?

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.836
- Keith.
- Yeah.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.994
- Why was it so weird between you two?
- It's always weird with him.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.309
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.672
But he seemed kinda nice
'cause he did offer you a job.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.879
- Are you gonna call him?
- No. No.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.872
All right.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.237
So... Here's what we know.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.118
Yeah?

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.591
It's definitely "Chicken on a Stick,"

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.717
and your play is gonna be a triumph.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.951
It's a one-woman show, so it's just me...

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.509
No, I mean, I'm acting in it, too.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:18.836
No, Mom, I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.794
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.519
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.713
No, he hasn't. He hasn't opened it yet.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.029
He needs some...

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.919
He's saving up, I think.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.072
No, he doesn't have a steady gig.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.959
But he's figuring it out,
it's just been a little tricky lately.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.232
Mom, he's gonna find a way to open it
and you're gonna love it, okay?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.549
How's Dad?

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.718
Sebastian. Come on in, man.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.112
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.556
Wasn't sure I'd see you today.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.518
- So... Here's the deal.
- Okay.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.513
We got distribution with Universal.
We've got our own imprint.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.000
About to go on the road.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.157
Uh, we can pay you 1,000 bucks a week,

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.358
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.079
Sound good?

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.591
- Sebastian? All right.
- Yeah.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.955
- Let's play.
- Okay.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.919
Tonight.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.070
I know. It's different.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.556
But you say you wanna save jazz.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.075
How you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.635
Jazz is dying because of people like you.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.919
You're playin' to 90-year-olds
at The Lighthouse.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.475
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.952
You're so obsessed with Kenny Clarke
and Thelonious Monk.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.679
These guys were revolutionaries.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.874
How are you gonna be a revolutionary
if you're such a traditionalist?

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.749
You're holdin' onto the past,
but jazz is about the future.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.552
I know.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.553
The other guy, he wasn't as good as you.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.714
But you're a pain in the ass, man.

Hey, it's me.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.200
Uh, I'm not sure where you are right now.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.513
I think Boston?
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.478
Uh...

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:53.318
I haven't heard from you in a little while
and I miss you.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.833
All right, bye.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.478
I thought... Surprise.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.433
Gotta leave first thing in the morning,
but I just had to see you...

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.678
It's so nice to be home.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.159
I'm so glad you're home.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.791
How's the play goin'?

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.519
Um... I'm nervous.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.319
- You are? Why?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.392
Because what if people show up?

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.755
Piece of caca.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.312
- You nervous about what they think?
- I'm nervous to do it.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.359
I'm nervous to get up on a stage
and perform for people...

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.794
I mean, I don't need to say that to you.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.476
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it, but I'm terrified.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:22.474
They should be so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.040
I can.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.469
When do you leave, the morning?

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.712
Yeah. 6:45.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.836
- Ooh.
- Boise.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.911
- Boise?
- Boise.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.639
To Boise!

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.874
You should come.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.549
To Boise?

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.313
Yeah, you can knock that
off your bucket list.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.394
Oh, that would be... really exciting.
I wish I could.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.709
What are you doing after the tour?

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.560
Why can't you?

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.790
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.314
'Cause I have to rehearse.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.392
But can't you rehearse anywhere?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.476
Anywhere you are?

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.392
I mean, I guess.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.871
Um... well, all my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.714
so I don't really think that would be...

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.158
- Okay. Well.
- ...the best idea right now, but...

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.436
I wish I could.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.398
We're just gonna have to try
and see each other.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.675
We almost never see each other.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.353
I know, but when are you done?

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.194
What do you mean? I mean...

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.351
When are you finished with the whole tour?

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.320
After we finish, we're gonna go
and record, and then we go back on tour.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.834
You know, we tour so we can
make the record,

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.196
so we can go back and tour the record.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.350
So it's like the long haul?

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.278
What do you mean, "the long haul"?

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.639
I mean the long haul, like you're gonna
stay in this band for a long time.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.400
On tour.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.913
What did you think I was gonna do?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.913
I don't...
I hadn't really thought it through.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.195
I didn't know that the band...

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.997
- was so important.
- You didn't think it would be successful?

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.674
Um...

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.514
No, that's not really what I mean.
I just mean that you...

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.310
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.959
Yeah. I don't believe... This is it.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.430
I mean, it could feasibly be...

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.240
I could be on tour with this
for a couple of years, at least.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.039
Just this record.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.354
Do you like the music you're playing?

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.997
I don't...

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.676
I don't know what it matters.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.832
Well, it matters, because if you're gonna
give up your dream,

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.836
I think it matters that you like
what you're playing on the road for years.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.840
Do you like the music I'm playing?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.880
Yeah. I do.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.316
I just didn't think that you did.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.790
- Yeah, well...
- You always said Keith is the worst,

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.998
and now you're gonna be on tour with him
for years, so I just didn't...

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.560
- What are you doing right now?
- ...know if you were happy.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.676
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.911
- What do you mean, why am I doing this?
- I thought you wanted me to do this.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.753
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.309
What do you mean, I wanted you to do this?

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.517
This is what you wanted for me.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.676
To be in this band?

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.480
To be in a band.
To have a steady job, you know?

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.911
To be... you know.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.957
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.997
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:27.355
and you could start your club.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.796
So I'm doing that, so I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.792
Why aren't you starting your club?

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.395
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.517
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick."

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.670
So change the name!

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.911
Well, no one likes jazz! Not even you!

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.838
I do like jazz now because of you!

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.355
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.638
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing "Jingle Bells"?

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.710
I'm not saying that.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.956
I'm saying why don't you take
what you've made and start the club?

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.680
Scraping pennies so I can start a club
no one wants to go to?

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.599
People will want to go to it
because you're passionate about it,

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.996
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.436
- You remind people of what they forgot.
- Not in my experience.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.796
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up, you know?

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.951
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.713
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.519
I wish you would have said them earlier,

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.034
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.839
I'm pointing out that you had a dream

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.673
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.877
This is the dream! This is the dream.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.235
This is not your dream!

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.551
Guys like me work their whole lives
to be in something

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.712
that's successful, that people like.
You know?

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.635
I mean, I'm finally in something
that people enjoy.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.074
Since when do you care about being liked?

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.640
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.672
Why do you care so much about being liked?

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.752
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.599
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.751
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.791
- Are you kidding?
- No.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.109
I don't know.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.836
Okay, fellas. I'll see ya tomorrow.

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.149
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.879
You're good for tonight, right?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.514
What are you talking about?

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.160
7:00, the photo shoot.

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.511
MOJO. Are you good?

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.591
- I thought that was next Thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.634
Is that okay?

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.952
- Give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:15.477
"What's wrong with that one?" It doesn't
bloody work, that's what's wrong with it!

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.233
All right, trumpet, that's lovely.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.912
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.276
Okay, keyboard. Okay, look up.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.353
That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.275
Okay, cut the music!
That is lovely. That's lovely.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.149
Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.870
like you're concentrating on something,
I don't know, like a piece of your music.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.189
Bite my what?

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.158
Your lip. You know, bite your lip like...

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.034
Yeah, that's good. That's great.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.349
Beautiful! Beautiful.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.717
Okay, now just move your glasses
down on... onto the nose...

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.395
A little bit further, just a little bit,
a touch further.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.716
Keep your head down, but look up at me.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.473
Look sort of moody.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:00.155
Yeah! That's beautiful! That is great!

01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:03.278
Okay, turn the keyboard on live!

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.680
Do you wanna hear the keyboard then?

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.400
You don't have to bite your lip now.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.915
Well, actually play something.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.117
Play something. You know? Anything.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.920
You're a pianist, aren't you?
Play something.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.159
That's great, that's beautiful.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.072
That's lovely. Oh, that's good.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.197
No, don't stop. Keep playing.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.920
Go on, just keep playing. That was great!

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.077
...shoot myself in the head.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.719
She's not even good.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.439
That whole window thing...

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.910
Yeah, what was that shit with the window?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.640
Oh, my God! Don't quit your day job.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.552
Oh, well...

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.519
Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.029
Mia!

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.714
Mia. I'm so sorry.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.600
Just tell me how it went. How was it?

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.115
- Don't help me.
- I'm sorry.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.556
- I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
- You're sorry, you're sorry...

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.394
You're sorry. You're sorry...

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.315
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Let me make it up to you, okay?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.911
- I don't blame you for not wanting...
- It's over.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.992
- What is?
- It's over.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.400
What?

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:34.754
All of this.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:38.390
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done, I'm done.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.159
- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.675
I can't pay back the theater.
This is so...

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.838
I'm gonna go home for a while.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.675
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:53.355
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:11.639
- Yep?
- Hi, I'm trying to reach Mia Dolan.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.229
Wrong number.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.880
She's not answering her cell.
I was told I might find her here.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.189
Not anymore.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.431
- Okay, well, if you do talk to her...
- I won't.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.239
...could you tell her Jane
at Amy Brandt Casting

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.879
is trying to reach her?

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.949
Casting?

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.840
Who the hell is that?

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:47.709
Shut that thing off!

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.669
Why did you come here?

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:02.031
- Because I have good news.
- What?

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.750
Amy Brandt, the casting director?

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.197
- Yeah.
- She was at your play, and she loved it.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.194
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come in tomorrow

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.954
and audition for this huge movie
that she's got.

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.600
I'm not going to that.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.956
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.760
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.115
I'm sorry?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.032
That will kill me.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.954
- What?!
- What?

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.838
What? Shh! Stop!

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.394
- No!
- Shh! Shh!

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.597
You have to be quiet.
We're in a neighborhood.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.797
If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make some goddamn sense!

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.109
- Tell me why you're not going.
- They'll call the police.

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.236
- Because. Because...
- Why?

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.994
I've been to a million auditions,
and the same thing happens every time

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.914
where I get interrupted because someone
wants to get a sandwich!

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.640
Or I'm crying, and they start laughing!

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.757
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room,

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.039
and they're like me, but prettier
and better at the...

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.759
Because maybe I'm not good enough!

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.116
- Yes, you are.
- No...

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.759
- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.639
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.795
Maybe I'm one of those people
that has always wanted to do it,

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.112
but it's like a pipe dream for me,
you know?

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.634
And then, you said it,

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.554
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.836
Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.957
And I can go back to school,

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.157
and I can find something else
I'm supposed to do.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.234
'Cause I left to do that,
and it's been six years,

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.913
and I don't want to do it anymore.

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:36.869
Why?

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:42.073
- Why what?
- Why don't you want to do it anymore?

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.629
'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.155
You're a baby.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.114
- I'm not a baby. I'm trying to grow up.
- You are.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.759
- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh, my God.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.958
You have an audition tomorrow at 5:30.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.714
I'll be out front at 8:00 A.M.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.196
You'll be out front or not, I don't know.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.354
How'd you find me here?

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.433
The house in front of the library.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.712
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.075
Mia?

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.356
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy and this is Frank.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.715
Hi. How are ya?

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.071
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad we found you.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.594
Me, too.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:33.880
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:35.440
It's gonna be a process.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:37.597
We're gonna build the character
around the actress.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.320
It's a three month rehearsal
and a four month shoot.

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.073
Okay.

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.710
And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.029
About?

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.796
- You can just tell us anything.
- Anything?

01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.679
Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.877
Um...

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.032
Whenever you're ready.

01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.076
My aunt used to live in Paris.

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.069
I remember she used to come home

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:26.440
and she would tell us these stories
about being abroad, and...

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.069
I remember...

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.598
She told us that she jumped
into the river once.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.712

When do you find out?

Oh, they said the next couple days.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.510
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:26.869
You're gonna get it.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.280
- I really might not.
- Yes, you are.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.034
- I hope you're not disappointed.
- I know.

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.760
I know. I know these things.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.069
Where are we?

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.599
- Griffith Park.
- Where... are we?

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.433
I know.

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.553
I don't know.

01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:53.158
What do we do?

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.199
I don't think we can do anything,

01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:59.193
- 'cause when you get this...
- If I get this.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.071
When you get this, you gotta give it
everything you got.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.189
Everything.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.919
It's your dream.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.957
What are you gonna do?

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.918
I gotta follow my own plan, you know?

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.071
Stay here and get my own thing goin'.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.439
You're gonna be in Paris. Good jazz there.

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.356
And you love jazz now. Right?

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:34.309
Yes.

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.990
And I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.872
I'm always gonna love you.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.153
I'm always gonna love you, too.

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:10.272
Look at this view!

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.200
- I've seen better. Yeah.
- It's the worst.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:20.552
I've never been here during the day.

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.719
Hi. Could I have two iced coffees, please?

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.269
- Right. Of course.
- On us.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.272
Oh, no, thank you, I insist.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.235
Sounds good. Harris did a good job.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.880
- Took him long enough.
- It always does.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.394
Signature time.

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:01.637
Not doin' too bad, Seb.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:04.599
- "Not too bad" is great.
- See ya tonight.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:06.000
See ya tonight.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.119
Hi.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.271
- How was your day?
- Good.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.799
- Hmm. How is she?
- She's great.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.109
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.317
Hi, buddy!

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.390
I didn't think you were gonna be home yet.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.631
- Are you drawing?
- Yeah.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:49.792
Can I help? You know I love to draw.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.960
Okay, Chelsea, we're gonna go.
Are you good?

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.635
- We're good.
- You need anything?

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.712
Bye, baby.

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.120
- Say "bye, Mommy."
- Sleep well.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.351
- Bye, Mommy.
- Have fun with Chelsea.

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.794
Have fun. Bye, Mia.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.553
- Bye. Thank you so much.
- Good night, guys.

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.836
- Night, sweetie. Bye.
- Good night.

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.758
Oh, boy.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.031
What if we miss this?
What do you wanna tell Natalie?

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.033
Oh... We'll just see it back in New York.

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.679
Okay.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.791
- I do not miss this.
- This is bad.

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:18.634
Do you want to just
pull off here and get dinner?

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:22.837
- Sure, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.195
Okay.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.351
Do you want to check it out?

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.834
This place is pretty cool.

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.953
I love them.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.872

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:31.794

this place if I'm not careful,

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.119
Khirye Tyler, everybody.

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:49.514
Uh...

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.512
Welcome to Seb's.

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.837
I just heard you play and I want to...

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.440
Do you want to stay for another?

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:41.638
- No, we should go.
- All right.

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:45.470
One, two. One, two, three, four.
