KHLYEN: Every story
starts with a lie.

00:09.677 --> 00:13.465
That’s thejob of beginnings.
To tell you you’re safe.

00:15.099 --> 00:18.466
That all of this lasts
and nothing will change.

00:19.312 --> 00:21.894
But underneath,
there are signs

00:23.232 --> 00:25.143
of your true story.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

00:29.655 --> 00:31.156
Who made you.

What battles
you were born to fight.

that matter along the way.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.420
An oath.

Your team.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.343
A home.

01:02.438 --> 01:06.522
Only then will you
see the real enemy.

01:06.651 --> 01:07.640
Her.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.819
Last ofa dying race,
come to destroy ours.

01:11.906 --> 01:14.568
She has her ships
and her slaves,

01:14.659 --> 01:17.196
but you have them.

01:17.286 --> 01:20.744
This strange, messy,
impossible family

01:20.831 --> 01:23.493
full of enemies

01:23.584 --> 01:25.324
and siblings,

01:26.295 --> 01:27.535
lovers...

01:29.799 --> 01:30.914
and hope.

01:33.344 --> 01:36.302
It doesn’t matter
how your story begins.

01:40.518 --> 01:43.635
It’s about who’s with you
at the end.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.810
Did everyone make it
out in time?

01:48.901 --> 01:50.607
Lord hopes.

01:50.695 --> 01:53.357
TURIN: Armada didn't much care
for your baller move.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.859
Started bombing other cities
in retaliation.

01:55.950 --> 01:59.363
We take much longer,
there won't be any
Quad left to save.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.614
Did your refugees
make it out?

02:01.706 --> 02:03.446
Old Towners?

02:03.541 --> 02:05.873
Yeah, safe on the prison ship
with Rennika and Gared.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.325
So, this is it.

02:08.379 --> 02:10.961
No backsies.
No goodbyes.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.879
Stick to the plan, yeah?

02:12.967 --> 02:15.333
We're going to see
each other again.
Tap our hearts.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.004
Oh, screw it, I want hugs.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.556
Oh, thank God.
PREE: Get in here,
you animals.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.474
Apocalypse hugs are the best.

This is how cold sores
are spread.

DUTCH: Come on, Ginger.
Bring it in.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.818
THE LADY: Wake up.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.571
You opened the cube?

02:41.662 --> 02:44.404
I learned all of Yalena's
secrets while in the Green.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.492
Do you know who I am?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.954
Yes.
Good.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.499
Time to rise, little man.

For what?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.379

03:40.805 --> 03:42.011
I'm a busy girl.

03:42.098 --> 03:44.214
What are you doing, Yalena?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.262
What you obviously couldn't.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.067
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.900
It's a rework of the lce9

designed.

Fossil records lD'd
The Lady's planet of origin.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.411
It's a hellhole.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.238
Life can only survive
in those temperate extremes

04:09.333 --> 04:10.914
by going dormant.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.582
So we force her into
hibernation.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.537
Yes. Drop her cell temp
low enough and fast enough?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.417
She'll be completely
vulnerable, easy kill.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.499
Now you just need to
figure out how to get
inside her box...

04:19.593 --> 04:20.969
Shut up.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.430
...without letting her escape
to eat your face.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.675
Is this a face-eating
shuaﬂon?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.883
I think it's just always
good protocol to assume, so...

04:28.978 --> 04:30.263
Can I tell
you something?

04:31.522 --> 04:33.558
You're my favorite
pretend-little-sister ever.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.638
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

04:35.401 --> 04:37.141
And everything's
going to be okay.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.396
You tell the best lies.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.572
That's what fake brothers
are for.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.282
But if anything goes wrong...

04:49.790 --> 04:52.452
Leave you, take Lucy,
save Dutch.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.334
KHLYEN: So, this is
our mystery destination.

04:59.425 --> 05:00.881
Why Arkyn?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.880
It's where you polluted
our family tree and then
the entire Quad,

05:03.971 --> 05:06.303
so, it seems fitting
for our final stand.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.891
Uh-huh. More poetry.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.091
I've got a real solid limerick
for you ifyou don't shut up.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.972
Ooh, all this hostility.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.802
Why haven't you killed her?
Who says I didn't try?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.763
You don't try, you do.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.481
That was the old me.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.231
The Hullen me.
The useful you.

05:22.448 --> 05:24.154
What good is this
version to me?

05:25.409 --> 05:27.695
The Khlyen who raised me
never gave up on a fight.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.777
She wants a name, Yala.
She asked me for one.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.703
That's not
collective thinking.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.781
She's been in our
bodies long enough
it's affecting her.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.412
In time,
she'll have empathy.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.835
She'll form a bond
with humans and she will
want to spare them.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.129
Being human doesn't
make you humane.

05:40.216 --> 05:42.628
You should know that
more than anyone.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.924
Well, I think The Qreshis
are here.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.636
I can smell
their tragic perfume.

I...
Found it in herthings.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.528
Do you think
it's still in style?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.240
Power never goes
out of style.

It's an honor.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.081
A lost family returns.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.130
You look amazingly well
for the presumed-dead, cousin.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.878
You'll have to teach
me that trick.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.675
Another time.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.128
Look, I won't trouble you with
the minutia of our plan, Liam,

06:29.223 --> 06:31.885
but we need the armament
codes from each
of the Nine Families.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.308
It's the only way
to keep Qresh safe.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.976
We'll put it to
a vote next council.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.145
We already have
five votes. It's done.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.184
Five?

are old allies.

of Land Kendry,

06:44.196 --> 06:46.187

06:46.282 --> 06:48.694
and I am the last
of Land Kin Rit.

06:48.784 --> 06:49.990
Five.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.318
I speak for Land Kendry now.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.621
And your land claim
is as expired as your dress.

06:55.708 --> 06:56.743
(PEOPLE TITTERING)

06:56.834 --> 07:00.793
We need the armament codes.
We aren't asking.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.837
Yes, but who
isn't asking, exactly?

07:03.924 --> 07:07.007
Your line is dead,
and so are you, dear cousin.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.177
So no harm in killing
you both again.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.008
We have soldiers
outside, Liam.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.844
Or did you think
we'd be unprepared?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.599
Our house guards
have them flanked,

07:19.690 --> 07:21.476
and our missiles have
their ships in sights.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.727
(SCOFFS LIGHTLY)

07:23.027 --> 07:24.858
You're out of
moves, ladies.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.357
You were never very good
at games, Liam.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.814
But you're worse with warfare.

07:31.660 --> 07:35.528
It's not the number
of weapons that matters.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.864
It's their proximity.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.414
And mine...

07:40.878 --> 07:42.664
is much...

07:43.213 --> 07:44.749
closer.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.133
She's Hullen.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.134
We Nine were taught to fear
Hullen from the cradle,

07:55.225 --> 07:56.601
and now here one is.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.267
The shovel in your grave.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.686
Unless...

08:01.649 --> 08:03.014
"Unless"?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.485
You kneel

08:05.569 --> 08:08.606
to your queens.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.956
Do you like
her dress now?

08:22.461 --> 08:24.668
You can't kill her, Yala.
She's too valuable.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.086
If her spawn make it
beyond the Quad,

08:26.173 --> 08:28.004
she's the only one that will
be able to control them.

08:28.092 --> 08:31.676
If you didn't want me to kill,
you should never have made me
your weapon.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.386
Stop.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.302
Here's good.

08:42.398 --> 08:43.979
Good for what?

08:44.066 --> 08:45.806
She is notjust going
to come at your bidding.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.357
Of course she is.

is a little push.

the Armada to say hello,

he dropped a little
something extra.

going to do to me?

What was that?

10:05.522 --> 10:06.773
This?

10:08.233 --> 10:10.349
It's the poison
that the assassin used

10:10.444 --> 10:13.607
in my memory
that you made me
relive a thousand times.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.562
I thought you'd
appreciate the symmetry.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.654
Do you remember
how painful it is?

10:21.830 --> 10:24.947
I know what it's like
to learn from Khlyen.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.998
He doesn't tell
you everything.

10:27.503 --> 10:29.619
He strings you along
a bit at a time,

10:29.713 --> 10:32.045
so that you'll
always need him.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.757
What hasn't
he told you? Hmm?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.798
How to use Jaq?

10:39.765 --> 10:44.134
Or how to splice
the best parts of us
into your little shit spawn?

Time's running out
for your answers.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.103

No, it wasn't.

a bio-feedback chip in you.

No, l'mjust curious
how you plan to stay on top.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.954
If any of these codes
are wrong,

12:30.042 --> 12:32.078
I will show you
what your innards look like

12:32.169 --> 12:34.000
and wear them as a skirt.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.340
Thank you.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.510
I like yourfamily.

They're polite.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.222
Bombs away.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.575

13:11.667 --> 13:13.373
Okay, it's going to get bumpy.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.826
Just 'cause they can't see us
don't mean they can't hit us.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.162
LUCY: Thank you. lam aware
of how physics works.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.838

13:21.802 --> 13:25.545

your new party trick, Luce.

JOHN: Here we go.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.095
Clear.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.432
Hey, didn't we already save
the world here once?

13:38.527 --> 13:40.233
I'm getting
Armageddon deja vu.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.311

Okay, tracking your position.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.738

Why are you whispering?
They can't hear you.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.111
Right... Uh, empathy?

13:47.202 --> 13:49.158
When you get to
the nextjuncture, keep left.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.407
That's the clearest route.
Ping me when you're there.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.516
We have control over
all docking gates.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.144
Lock this one open

Zeph, there’s an anomaly
in the Armada security files.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.198
One of your patients

14:30.120 --> 14:31.109
(GUNSHOTS)

14:31.830 --> 14:34.572
I thought this was
the clear route?
It was.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.951
Zeph? Ping.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.283
JOHN: Ping! We’re taking fire!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.414
We need a new route.
Yes, hi, hold on!

14:40.505 --> 14:41.585
Hang on, hang on.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.289
There's a side hall
50 feet ahead.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.794

15:08.784 --> 15:10.740
Get me my ship.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.488
Go, do as she says.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.124

Hey.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.343
That was a dead shot.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.099
How the hells
did you survive that?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.351
Take after my mom.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.728
Then why are you
healing so slowly?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.268
Oh. 'Cause
you take after me.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.192
How did The Lady
even find you?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.774
She didn't.
I led her to me.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.736
I started
having visions again,
and I seen you get shot.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.696
So I came to save you.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.872
The things I see,
they're all bad.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.704
You can't do this without me,

16:05.799 --> 16:07.835
and I'm not sure we can
do this at all.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.884
No, no. You are a kid,
not a human shield.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.132
I'm taking you to Lucy. John,
how are we doing on that exit?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.463
Dad.

16:14.558 --> 16:18.016
You don't get to protect
your family by risking
everyone else's.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.889
That's not how it works.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.187
Remember when you were
like a toddler for five hours
and had no opinion?

16:26.278 --> 16:27.734
I miss that time.

16:29.698 --> 16:30.733
Can you walk?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.945
JOHN: Jaq, way to heal.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.026
So, double shield?
Okay.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.827
Stay between us, bud.
And close your eyes.

a whole bunch of people.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.501
This is where you were born.

call it that.

about Hallcyon, remember?

17:00.437 --> 17:02.473
I think the words
you're looking for
are "thank you."

17:02.564 --> 17:04.395
LUCY: Dutch?
Yeah, go ahead, Lucy.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.939
A ship from the Armada
has breached your atmosphere.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.483
All right, girl.
You know what to do.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.106
She'll be landing soon.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.654
Last chance, Yala.

17:13.783 --> 17:14.943
I'm worried about you.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.822
And underestimating me,
as always.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.871
Really? I think I know you
better than anyone.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.334
And every harm,
and every failure,

17:23.418 --> 17:25.704
and every sin I committed
against you and Aneela.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.457
Yes, I know those, too,
which is why I'm trying
to fix all this.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.379
(LOUDLY) I don't want
you to fix this.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.957
Well, then what do you
want me to do?

17:32.052 --> 17:36.011
I want you stop
making me feel small,
so you can feel big!

17:36.848 --> 17:39.635
I want you to stop hurting me,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.308
so that you can save me.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.478
Because the only person
I have ever needed saving from

17:45.565 --> 17:46.896
is you.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.487
No!

17:54.282 --> 17:57.149
All right, Yalena.
You have my attention.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.408
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:20.058 --> 18:21.673
When we're back
with the Armada,

18:21.768 --> 18:25.226
I'll find you a choker
that's more your style.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.144
You're not going back
to the Armada, ever.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.482
You're going to stop me?

the minute you landed.

in here with you now.

if I were you,

one hell of a slumber party.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.716
Go. Look into it.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.260
Why try to detain me?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.389
Oh, they're after my body.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.732
Like a virgin on prom night.

going to get it.

yourself to, what,

just got interesting.

it's really you?

21:03.847 --> 21:05.758
Say something!
Don't come any closer!

21:05.849 --> 21:07.009
What? Why?

21:07.684 --> 21:09.925
Because it's cold...

21:11.896 --> 21:13.682
and I'm not at my best.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.317

she's worth saving?

the dance you taught
Yala for her wedding?

21:27.912 --> 21:29.994
I love that memory.

to embarrass us to death?

'Cause I'm really not into
murder foreplay.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.515
I won't have to murder you
at all ifyou just drop
the shield.

the order to slaughter
them right now.

when the shields are up.

how my communications work.

him go, Johnny.

24:53.743 --> 24:54.858
Got one.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.910
We need to get out
of here and find her
ventilation source.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.703
Aneela, you good?

24:59.791 --> 25:02.032
Go.
Come on.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.619
Zeph, wait, wait.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.090
Look,

25:08.174 --> 25:11.587
I... I don't want to die again

25:11.678 --> 25:15.762
or save the world
until I have a chance
to tell you that...

25:20.937 --> 25:21.926
I already know.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.933
I want 12 babies.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.648
Wha...

25:27.735 --> 25:30.226
Pippin,
you're tripping balls!

25:30.405 --> 25:32.396
Ow.
Come on, fight it.

25:32.490 --> 25:34.481
I need to stabilize
your central nervous system

25:34.575 --> 25:35.985
before you pass...

25:36.077 --> 25:38.193
out. Shit.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.240
D'AVIN: Ow, man.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.743
Feel like I'm inside
a constipated robot.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.074
JOHN: Zeph,
we got problems.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.159
What is it, John?
New plan.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.869
I’m going to have to
go through the atmo feed-pipe.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.250
Lucy, schematics.
I need to know
where that pipe starts.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.922
LUCY: Sending coordinates.
Wait.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.874
What kind of pipe is it?
What if it's gas-permeable?

25:53.970 --> 25:56.302
Uh, well, then I guess we'll
all just freeze to death.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.634
BOTH: I heard that.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.091
Can we all be Suzy Sunshines
for a minute

26:01.185 --> 26:02.891
and assume that this plan
is going to work,

26:02.979 --> 26:04.594
and we'll flip her
to hibernation mode?

26:04.689 --> 26:07.931
JOHN: And once we have her
neutralized, what’s your
preferred kill-shot, Zeph?

26:10.403 --> 26:11.734
Fire.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.697
Burn her like she deserves.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.362
You got it.

26:15.450 --> 26:16.781
D'AVIN: All right.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.582
What do you want?

26:31.174 --> 26:34.132
I wish you could hear
them screaming.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.129
She doesn't have
much time left.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.721
He's winning.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.305
ANEELA: If you make
him hurt her,

26:43.144 --> 26:45.931
he will never forgive you.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.434
He always
hurts her.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.310
And you.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.859
Not like this.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.312
Why are you crying?

26:56.491 --> 26:58.447
WOMAN: I don't want to
hurt you, Aneela.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.115
We're the same.

27:00.203 --> 27:03.445
Ruthless, alone... until her.

27:03.539 --> 27:06.030
My favorite memory
is one of yours.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.332
The one Khlyen hid from us.

27:08.419 --> 27:12.253
The clay Yala was born
in that mirror box.
You were so happy.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.087
Do you remember?

27:20.890 --> 27:22.255
Yes.

27:22.934 --> 27:26.518
It feels right to end her
where she began.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.970
I can say goodbye for you.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.308
Any last words?

27:36.864 --> 27:39.480
Let her go!

27:41.911 --> 27:42.900
Tighter.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.986
Stay with me. Come on.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.117
You're stronger than this.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.449
Do you remember
your tenth birthday?

27:49.544 --> 27:52.126
Listen! Focus on the day.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.250
All you wanted
was a gift. Huh?

28:02.640 --> 28:05.598
Your father had that made
just for you.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.262
I wanted a doll.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.095
Dolls are for little girls,
not little warriors.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.349
You're better than that.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.185
Doesn't feel better.

28:13.943 --> 28:15.274
It Will.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.561
The world is unkind
to little girls,

28:18.656 --> 28:21.489
because they don't think
you can be warriors.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.237
But their mistake

28:24.328 --> 28:26.910
is your advantage.

28:27.582 --> 28:28.867
Use it.

28:29.667 --> 28:33.535
Always keep this blade hidden
where they can never find it,

28:33.629 --> 28:35.881
until it's too late.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.594
KHLYEN: Good girl.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.176
Now finish it, please.
Before she makes me...

28:50.354 --> 28:51.343
(GROANS)

28:54.400 --> 28:56.140
I don't like this anymore!

28:57.153 --> 28:58.939
Why aren't I enjoying this?

29:02.658 --> 29:03.909
Don't.

29:04.619 --> 29:05.608
Stop that!

29:06.662 --> 29:07.868
Yala...

29:12.960 --> 29:14.120
Make me.

29:15.129 --> 29:17.871
JOHN: This is it.
This must be her life support.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.419
Okay, it's pneumatic.
So, it's got to be one
of the back ones.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.006
Which one is it?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.008
Why are you asking me?
You're the smart one.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.966
Hey, first of all,
you are very smart.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.177
But we are about to die,
and you are psychic as shit!

29:32.271 --> 29:34.057
So, which one is it?
It doesn't work on command.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.935
Okay, okay.
What if I touch them? Huh?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.849
Anything? No?
Is that doing anything?

29:38.945 --> 29:40.230
Okay, please pick
before we die.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.657
Jaq.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.235
This one.

29:49.664 --> 29:51.950
You're sure?
Pretty sure.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.573
Okay.

29:54.377 --> 29:56.117
Ifwe die...

29:57.129 --> 29:58.665
you're still
my favorite nephew.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.371
I was going to pick
that one, too.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.095
(WHIRRING)

30:08.766 --> 30:11.007
Okay, go, go, go.
We have 20 seconds.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.435
Stop moving.

30:15.523 --> 30:18.185
I am not your doll anymore.

30:19.694 --> 30:20.934
Or his.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.070
THE LADY: You're not much
of anything to anyone.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.988
You're a cheap copy.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.362
Not even as good
as the real Aneela.

30:29.453 --> 30:31.910
I'll tell you what I am.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.748
I'm the woman who's going
to bloody end you.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.880
(SCREAMING)

31:02.153 --> 31:04.109
Is it dead?

31:05.531 --> 31:07.237
It's dead.

31:14.874 --> 31:15.863
(WEAPON THUDS)

31:19.003 --> 31:19.992
(EXCLAIMS WEARILY)

31:22.882 --> 31:24.338
It's over.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.634
Now aren't you glad
I got you that birthday knife?

31:32.725 --> 31:34.340
(LAUGHS)

31:36.103 --> 31:37.092
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

31:37.897 --> 31:39.307
(WHISPERING)
It's over.

32:14.725 --> 32:16.181
Hi.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.727
Way to not die.
You too.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.848
Jack, jack, jack

32:23.943 --> 32:25.353
Jack the system, jack

32:25.778 --> 32:27.814
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

32:40.292 --> 32:42.203
Jack the system

32:44.296 --> 32:45.672
Jack the system, jack

32:47.550 --> 32:49.632
Jack the system

32:51.804 --> 32:55.717
So, it doesn't bother you
that prison party
and prison riot

32:55.808 --> 32:57.389
sounds the same?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.175
Your spider's shrinking.

33:00.271 --> 33:01.977
From the cryo, maybe?

33:02.064 --> 33:03.565
Shrinking's good, right?

33:04.358 --> 33:06.223
Not sure.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.899
How did you survive
the explosion?

33:07.987 --> 33:09.477
Honestly, I don't know.

33:09.572 --> 33:13.565
The last thing I remember
isjust being really,
really...

33:13.951 --> 33:15.316
noble.

33:15.411 --> 33:18.403
Maybe your little brain buddy
has some sort of
self-defense mode,

33:18.497 --> 33:20.579
or got you into an escape pod.
Or...

33:21.917 --> 33:23.418
You could just relax,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.164
chill with all
the science stuff
for one minute

33:26.255 --> 33:28.541
and celebrate with me.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.503
Yayl I'm not dead.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.920
I'm not getting my hopes up
just to lose you again.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.970
Yeah, no one gets
to be safe forever.

33:41.395 --> 33:44.432
And look, I know
that hope is hard.

33:46.317 --> 33:49.775
But at the same time,
it's kind of the best.

33:51.822 --> 33:55.064
And I'm not giving up
on mine, so maybe,

33:55.826 --> 33:58.488
don't look a gift Pippin
in the mouth.

34:01.373 --> 34:05.537
Or at his hideous new scars,
because that would make
him feel insecure.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.371
(BREATH TREMBLING)

34:23.562 --> 34:25.427
(WHISPERING)
The scars are cool.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.511
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

34:35.282 --> 34:39.525
If Jaq breaks
his first curfew,
I will blame his father.

34:40.663 --> 34:41.652
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

34:41.747 --> 34:43.533
Oh, sweetie.

34:43.624 --> 34:47.367
You know I love you, but I'm
super not into medical play.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.292
You don't owe me this.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.343
If you want to stay human,

34:59.598 --> 35:02.761
I will hold your hands
when you turn gray.

35:04.270 --> 35:09.139
I will bury you with honor
and burn worlds in your name.

35:09.817 --> 35:12.559
And you will not be forgotten.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.480
Or?
The war is over.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.574
And we have a son.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.822
And an empire.

35:24.540 --> 35:27.327
And I need my queen.

35:29.003 --> 35:32.621
Do you even have enough Green
left in you to share?

35:32.715 --> 35:35.001
I want to find out

35:36.552 --> 35:38.463
ifyou do.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.846
Hey! Who's sober?

35:43.225 --> 35:44.886
Oh, never mind.
You're never sober.

35:44.977 --> 35:45.966
(STARTLED GASPING)

35:47.855 --> 35:50.847
Wouldn't relax your taints
just yet. We have issues.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.390
Remember when
the Armada's bombers

35:53.485 --> 35:55.942
left the mothership,
we thought to attack Qresh?

35:56.572 --> 36:00.281
Turns out The Lady sent
half her fleet
outside the Quad.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.356
VVhy?

36:01.452 --> 36:03.568
I sent out a boomer
to shoot one of them down.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.529
Just heard back.
It was full of hatchlings.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.372
Oh, shit.

36:08.917 --> 36:10.418
How many ships escaped?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.912
Don't know how many.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.665
We don't know how long
she's been sending them

36:13.756 --> 36:15.337
or where they went.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.123
DUTCH: / think / can find out.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.085
Why didn't you kill me?

36:22.514 --> 36:25.472
One of Khlyen's first lessons.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.675
Don't kill
what you might need.

36:27.770 --> 36:31.729
I'm not going to help you
find my children, Yalena.

36:35.903 --> 36:39.942
We've tracked down
most of your ships
to start the hunt.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.738
So, the sooner you help
us find the rest,

36:41.825 --> 36:44.441
the sooner you get
some privileges in here.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.651
Some.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.532
They'll kill everyone.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.989
And then I will find a way
to get out of here.

36:50.084 --> 36:51.665
You can try.

36:52.836 --> 36:56.954
You'rejust a human girl now,
trapped in that body.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.415
Humans get to choose.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.761
But choices have consequences.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.340
And I get to choose, too,
and ifyou decide to do that,

37:08.852 --> 37:10.513
I will kill you.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.022
Think about it.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.817
Here.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.697
From Khlyen?

37:36.088 --> 37:37.703
No.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.467
The war's over.
Now the rebuild begins.

37:51.562 --> 37:55.020
Soon as we find
every last goddamn bug.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.689
New RAC calls for a new oath.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.939
As of today,
we're everyone's citizens.

Everyone's soldiers.

38:11.582 --> 38:12.742
Fist to heart.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.158
Welcome to the new Level 6.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.079
Now let's go hunt
for some hatchlings.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.747
(GROUP SHOUTING IN UNISON)

38:23.760 --> 38:25.625
I'm still terrified.

38:31.560 --> 38:35.178
Shoo! Stop following me.
You're like a very tall rash.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.853
We are not done.

38:36.940 --> 38:40.103
Westerlyns suffered and died
in a war you Qreshis started.

38:40.194 --> 38:43.061
They need relocation,
reparations.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.816
They have rights.
Fine.

I'm never going
to be nice, Pree...

to be good.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.250
I'II hold you to that.

I hope you do.

What?
My husband's Governor.

39:50.514 --> 39:51.879
Mr. Governor.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.595
Okay.
Okay, sweetie. Breathe.

39:55.686 --> 39:58.268
I made it, Mal Woo!

39:58.564 --> 39:59.724
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Muah!

40:05.320 --> 40:07.060
John.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.156
Looks like you got
all the help you need
for a while.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.869
If I don't leave now,
I never will.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.242
Good, 'cause we're
not done yet.
We still have the hatchlings.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.198
There's always going
to be something.

40:20.294 --> 40:22.410
Another warrant,
another apocalypse.

40:25.674 --> 40:27.710
But I won't leave

40:27.843 --> 40:29.879
unless you say
you're okay with it.
Fine.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.461
No.

40:33.265 --> 40:37.008
No, that...
That wasn't a real option,
you click.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.844
Well, you shouldn't have
said it then, asshole.

40:39.938 --> 40:40.927
(LAUGHS)

40:41.940 --> 40:43.646
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

40:45.235 --> 40:46.896
If it's what you need...

40:49.865 --> 40:51.981
then it's what we do.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.940
And while you're
at it, take Lucy.

40:54.036 --> 40:56.618
Dutch, I can't do that.

40:56.705 --> 40:58.696
LUCY: Please don’t fight
over me, it’s awkward.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.371
Also, I choose Johnny.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.991
Well...
See?

41:05.964 --> 41:06.953
Lucy,

41:09.176 --> 41:12.589
promise me you'll bring
him home safe
and in exactly one year.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.761
Do you understand?
LUCY: Agreed.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.306
It's a date.

41:20.354 --> 41:22.845
Find what you're
looking for, Johnny.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.269
And then,

41:26.568 --> 41:28.149
bring it home.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.360
Tap my heart.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.028
LUCY: l’ve located one
of the missing bombers.

41:36.119 --> 41:38.030
Shall / engage?

41:39.414 --> 41:40.403
(SIGHS)

41:41.333 --> 41:43.289
One for the road?

41:45.212 --> 41:46.201
(LAUGHING)

41:48.006 --> 41:50.247
The J is a big place.
What are you
going to do first?

41:50.342 --> 41:54.130
I don't know, get a moon-tan
on Hoff. Find Clara,
destroy the Hackmod factory.

41:54.262 --> 41:57.129
You know, we could help.
Hey, I'm allowed to have
my own things.

41:57.641 --> 42:01.350
But also, I'm calling you for
backup if shit gets weird.

42:04.064 --> 42:06.931
All right, landing gear's
prepped. How do you want
to play this?

42:07.442 --> 42:10.650
You take point,
I'll lay down a flash-cover.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.066
But first...

42:18.537 --> 42:22.655
I love you, too. Don't make
a big deal about it.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.535
I said it first.

42:25.752 --> 42:28.710
Johnny, count us down.
You got it.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.413
Giving alien babies hells
and not feeling bad about it

42:31.508 --> 42:33.089
in five,

42:33.176 --> 42:36.134
four, three,

42:36.221 --> 42:39.008
two, one.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.891
(SINGING) Whoa

42:42.978 --> 42:45.811
Whoa

42:45.897 --> 42:48.639
Heartbeat pounding deep

42:48.734 --> 42:51.692
Got moves you’ve never seen

42:51.778 --> 42:54.986
Crack them knuckles
ready for the hustle

42:55.073 --> 42:58.315
Blow that whistle

42:58.410 --> 43:00.275
Whoa

43:00.370 --> 43:02.861
I'm going to miss this.

43:02.956 --> 43:04.867
JOHN: Let's go get them.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.823
Whoa

43:06.918 --> 43:08.704
Dibs on the big one.

43:12.299 --> 43:14.790
(S I N G I N G)
Coming in like a champion

43:18.930 --> 43:21.091
Burning like a legend

43:21.183 --> 43:23.424
Hey, hey, hey!

43:25.103 --> 43:26.263
Come on!

43:26.354 --> 43:28.436
Heartbeat pounding deep

43:28.523 --> 43:31.981
Got moves you’ve never seen

43:32.068 --> 43:34.684
Crack them knuckles
Ready for the hustle
