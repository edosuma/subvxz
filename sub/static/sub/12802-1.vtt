Neil, we all want this sale to happen,

03:07.523 --> 03:10.989
but these terms,
well, they're just not going to work.

03:11.409 --> 03:15.704
Your original offer was,
for lack of a better term,

03:15.804 --> 03:18.417
ridiculous, and this is even worse.

Now, Neil, you can't just grind
and grind and grind

changing the bid every time.

03:26.791 --> 03:30.242

now I suggest...

the real one about to land upstairs.

why we're up here?

Jerry, from where I'm sitting...

you seem downright stressed.

a massive problem here?

No, I mean, I could see
that you may have a problem.

is whether or not I can get to the roof

it's a fire sale,

fucking started.

Neil, I don't know, is it really necessary
that I go this weekend?

06:50.528 --> 06:54.282
It has zero to do with work and I have
zero desire to hang out with your friends.

06:54.382 --> 06:55.667
This weekend's gonna be epic.

06:55.767 --> 06:59.537
Epic, as in I'll have to contend
with Jason's antics all weekend?

06:59.637 --> 07:03.875
I did not even invite Jason.
I knew that would make you happy.

did you stop working out?

- Hey, babe.
- Don't call me babe.

07:34.238 --> 07:37.275
- You want me to take that?
- Entirely unnecessary.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.611
The Droid, right? I get it.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.314
I told you this was a horrible idea.

ride back with me to the city,

of creation, decay, and destruction.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.010
Listen, I know.

01:09:37.109 --> 01:09:40.100
We're gonna go down to the ferry,
everyone's heading there to get off the island.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.291
- Why the ferry?
- Because getting to the ferry's our only hope.

[SCREAMING]

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.454
- Shit! Oh, my God.
- Talk too much!

01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:12.405
Come here.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:17.614
What... oh, Jason! Sorry, Jason,
we can't go back that way.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.634
I just tried to get to the ferry
and they are animals, all of them!

01:10:20.734 --> 01:10:23.854
For what you did to Neil, you deserve
worse than what they would doing to do!

01:10:23.954 --> 01:10:26.156
- JOEY: Jason, stop it!
- You have no idea what's going on.

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:27.958
You have no idea
what you are talking about!

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:31.829
Neil deserved everything that he got,
okay? You know how it feels.

01:10:31.929 --> 01:10:35.180
He always had the upper hand, he always
had control over me and I wanted control,

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.636
- I wanted to win just once!
- You won, he's dead!

01:10:37.736 --> 01:10:41.038
- He killed himself, Theresa.
- What?

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:45.108
Jason, we don't have time
to turn on each other.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:48.301
We have to go find Danny, come on!

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.482
- You can't take the beach, guys.
- JOEY: Theresa.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:57.287
- If you go that way, we die.
- The beach, it's worse.

01:10:57.387 --> 01:11:00.654
- Theresa, please come.
- JASON: Come on!

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:13.267
JOEY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Jason!

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.799
Oh, fuck, guys! Oh, my God.

01:11:41.899 --> 01:11:44.131
Oh, no.

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:49.473
[LAUGHING]

01:11:49.573 --> 01:11:53.043
Hey, hey! Hey, let them go, let them go!

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:56.376
Look, man, we're just trying
to get off this island.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.082
Therein lies the rub.

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:00.614
Danny.

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:05.456
You guys don't get it.
You wanna leave here?

01:12:05.956 --> 01:12:08.755
What are you going back to?

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.258
[DISTORTED NOISES]

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:17.968
It's perfect here.
No more pretending, no more lies.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:21.639
We can be free.
Why would you wanna leave paradise?

01:12:21.739 --> 01:12:24.508
Danny, we're your friends!
Why are you doing this to us?

01:12:24.608 --> 01:12:25.943
Oh, wait, you're my friends,

01:12:26.043 --> 01:12:29.520
is that why you guys always
treat me like a dickless clown?

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.415
Why I'm always the butt
of your fucking jokes?

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:35.190
Danny, it's us, let us go! This place...

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:40.674
This place is magical!
I am the Neo here! Can't you see?

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:44.644
You don't know me.
You guys know the old me.

01:12:44.744 --> 01:12:46.825
The scared me.

01:12:46.925 --> 01:12:49.967
The me who gave a fuck what you thought!

01:12:50.067 --> 01:12:55.639
This is the real me!
The king of the motherfucking beach!

01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:59.909
Come on, Danny, let's stop it!
I mean, look around, look what's happening!

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:03.947
People are dying! Your friends are dead!

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:08.177
I can't tell you how happy I am...

01:13:08.277 --> 01:13:11.117
to never be jealous of you again.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:18.807
Stop! Danny, you're turned into a monster!

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:21.184
[LAUGHING]

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.736
Jason, when you've got a chance
take Joey and run!

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:29.838
Oh, wait, shit. Shh, shh, shh.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.876
You guys having
a little chitchat over here?

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:35.942
Theresa, why don't you share
with everybody.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:39.012
I was just saying...

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:47.324
You're the king of this beach,
but where's your queen?

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:51.208
- What is a king without a queen, right?
- My God.

01:13:51.538 --> 01:13:54.397
You're right, I need a queen!
Will you be my queen?

01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:57.201
Just like that, will you be my queen?

01:13:57.301 --> 01:14:00.771
You know, I never realized
what you were capable of.

01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:03.806
And now you see me.

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:05.876
You can see me!

01:14:05.976 --> 01:14:11.482
And you still think that you can control me
like you controlled Neil?

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:16.352
Oh, you're getting me fucking hard!

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.022
That's funny.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.592
See, I always knew you had a thing for me.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:25.428
Everyone did, but I didn't give a shit

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:28.932
because you were invisible on my radar.

01:14:29.032 --> 01:14:32.702
Compared to Neil,
you're nothing, he was a giant.

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:37.073
- It's a new Danny. String her up!
- [CHEERING]

Jason, you're next.

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:57.383
Oh, my God, I feel so dumb! [LAUGHS]

01:14:58.183 --> 01:15:03.667
Before you go, there's something
that I've been meaning to give you.

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:07.641
Danny, no! No! No, you can't!

01:15:09.223 --> 01:15:12.026

Wait, don't leave,
don't leave, don't leave!

01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:34.938
Hey.

- You okay? Why don't you have a seat?
- Where is he?

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.677
You know who. The man.
Listen, man, I know that he's here!

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:58.118
Sit down and relax,
just have a seat right...

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:09.692
- Hey, hey!
- Oh, hello, Jason.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:12.596
- Where is he?
- Who?

01:17:12.696 --> 01:17:15.499
I'll take it from here, captain.

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:18.489
Well...

01:17:18.589 --> 01:17:22.002
you certainly know
how to make an entrance.

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.275
You're gonna tell me
what the fuck's going on!

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:35.231
Jason, I know it's hard for you
to understand, but... trust me,

01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:39.786
you cannot grasp the totality
of this grand design.

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.811
What you witnessed

01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:47.531
was the dawn of something
as necessary as it is devastating.

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:51.601
No, I don't understand why you wanna kill
every man, woman, and child on this island.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.367
That was none of my doing.
I didn't lift a finger.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:59.476
You know damn well that shit you sold
everyone's wreaking havoc on that island!

01:17:59.576 --> 01:18:02.712
Jason, Jason, I didn't sell anything.

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:06.880
All Urge did was lift up the rock.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.954
What you saw was the wickedness
and evil that laid beneath it.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:14.823
So you're playing God? Spiting the wicked?

01:18:15.261 --> 01:18:17.957
[LAUGHS] Wrong on both accounts.

What?

And I am not the one who will do
the smiting, Jason, it will be you.

You have lived your whole life
as the son of a scoundrel and a whore.

Without the slightest notion
of any meaning in this world.

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:38.782
You have no roots.

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:42.849
You go from place to place,
from woman to woman.

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:47.924
Never allow yourself to succumb
to the lure of stability.

01:18:48.024 --> 01:18:50.327
Why is that?

01:18:50.627 --> 01:18:53.797
Because you know there is no such thing.

01:18:53.897 --> 01:18:59.502
Nothing, it is a fallacy.
Normality? Stability?

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.940
It's a construct, a fantasy,
you see through that.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.638
You see the truth.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.311

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:12.479
I know all. I see all.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.765
Yet...

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:19.256
I didn't expect to find you.

The anomalies of my creations are
always so fascinating. [CHUCKLES]

01:19:25.799 --> 01:19:31.600
Jason, you will stand beside me
and you will help me cleanse this world

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.734
and return it to perfection.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:39.176
You will take Urge to the city
and then you will take it to the world!

- This is insanity.
- You need proof?

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:46.694
You need context?
It's totally understandable.

have nothing to give you.

back at this decrepit world.
