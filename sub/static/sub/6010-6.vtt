00:39.704 --> 00:40.824
Thank you.

00:54.746 --> 01:00.025
I know we sound like parrots, Tom,
but I would like to help, if I can.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.106
So would Mary.

01:03.266 --> 01:05.385
My wife is dead.

01:06.546 --> 01:08.865
I'm past help.

01:08.866 --> 01:10.906
But thank you.

01:15.386 --> 01:18.785
The guests looked for you
to say goodbye.

01:18.786 --> 01:20.786
I was here.

01:25.226 --> 01:29.905
I hope you'll let me know
if there's... anything I can do.

01:29.906 --> 01:31.906
Anything at all.

01:33.106 --> 01:35.145
Thank you.

01:35.146 --> 01:39.865
I'll come with you.
Save him getting the car out twice.

01:39.866 --> 01:44.145
You're both very welcome to stay
for some dinner. I don't think so.

01:44.146 --> 01:46.986
Grief makes one so terribly tired.

01:48.546 --> 01:50.506
Goodbye, my dear.

01:52.186 --> 01:55.586
Now that it's over,
try to get some rest.

02:11.546 --> 02:13.665
Is it over?

02:13.666 --> 02:17.146
When one loses a child,
is it ever really over?

02:22.386 --> 02:25.865
Cheer up, Mr Barrow.
A long face won't solve anything.

02:25.866 --> 02:31.625
Leave him alone. He knew Lady Sybil
better than any of us. Except you.

02:31.626 --> 02:34.505
We were the two who really knew her.

02:34.506 --> 02:37.865
I must say,
your grief speaks well for her.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.706
Thank you for that.
Thank you for saying that.

02:43.826 --> 02:47.185
Are you sure you wouldn't like this
in the dining room, ma'am?

02:47.186 --> 02:51.906
No, thank you. I'd like to eat
quickly and have an early night.

02:55.106 --> 02:57.465
How was the service?

02:57.466 --> 02:59.626
Oh, quite nicely done.

03:00.826 --> 03:04.505
But you know how it is
when you bury someone young.

03:04.506 --> 03:06.506
When you lose your child...

03:07.946 --> 03:11.066
there's nothing worse
under the sun.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.225
I was wondering if I... might try
to take her out of herself.

03:17.226 --> 03:19.985
Perhaps give a little lunch party,
nothing formal.

03:19.986 --> 03:23.066
Just Lady Grantham and the girls.

03:24.826 --> 03:27.306
And I could cook something special.

03:30.426 --> 03:34.105
Well,
we don't have to decide that now.

03:34.106 --> 03:37.785
But I don't understand
why they haven't let him out.

03:37.786 --> 03:41.025
Mr Murray hasn't been to see
Mrs Bartlett yet.

03:41.026 --> 03:45.105
And when he does, she may not want
to repeat the things she said to me.

03:45.106 --> 03:47.385
She must be made to repeat them.

03:47.386 --> 03:51.425
Even then, would we have enough
to overturn the verdict?

03:51.426 --> 03:55.505
How can we prove she was cooking
that pie, not something else?

03:55.506 --> 03:58.786
Because something else
would have been found.

04:01.666 --> 04:05.706
Look, I'm not saying
it'll all be done by Tuesday.

04:06.626 --> 04:09.906
But this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

04:14.786 --> 04:16.906
What's the matter?

04:18.625 --> 04:21.106
It's so nice of you to say "we".

04:22.146 --> 04:23.985
I mean it.

04:23.986 --> 04:26.906
We need some good news
in this house, Anna.

04:27.986 --> 04:30.666
And this is it. This must be it.

04:38.186 --> 04:41.985
I thought I might move back in here
tonight, if you'll have me.

04:41.986 --> 04:47.346
Not yet. I think I'd rather sleep
alone for a while yet.

04:49.106 --> 04:52.706
Well, if you're sure.
I'm sure.

04:55.346 --> 04:58.945
Cora... Let's not go through it
all again. I'm not arguing.

04:58.946 --> 05:04.385
You listened to Clarkson and
so should I have done, but Tapsell
has a reputation as an expert.

05:04.386 --> 05:09.106
And you believed him. Dr Clarkson
knew Sybil's history and he did not.

05:10.706 --> 05:15.265
You believed Tapsell because
he's knighted and fashionable.

05:15.266 --> 05:17.945
And has a practice in Harley Street.

05:17.946 --> 05:23.745
You let
all that nonsense weigh against
saving our daughter's life!

05:23.746 --> 05:27.226
Which is what I find
so very hard to forgive.

05:28.626 --> 05:31.625
Do you think I miss her
any less than you?

05:31.626 --> 05:34.026
I should think you miss her more.

05:35.266 --> 05:39.306
Since you blocked the last chance
we had to prevent her death.

05:43.826 --> 05:46.545
I'll say good night, then.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.866
Good night.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.705
How's the baby doing?

06:14.706 --> 06:18.186
I envy her.
She doesn't know a thing about it.

06:21.786 --> 06:24.786
You ought to think
about getting a nurse.

06:25.626 --> 06:28.825
Mrs Rose will leave,
once the baby's weaned.

06:28.826 --> 06:33.625
Perhaps a local girl.
But I'm not staying.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.226
Or at least just until I find a job.

06:37.706 --> 06:40.746
Well, there's no rush.
God, no!

06:41.866 --> 06:46.265
Tom's right. He has to start to make
a life for himself some time.

06:46.266 --> 06:48.746
Some time, yes. Not right away.

06:50.906 --> 06:53.945
And anyway,
now that the funeral's over,

06:53.946 --> 06:56.786
we ought to think about
the christening.

06:57.586 --> 07:02.146
Do you know
what you'd like her to be called?
I'd like to call her Sybil.

07:04.386 --> 07:05.866
Of course.

07:08.426 --> 07:12.106
You don't think it might be
a little painful?

07:12.986 --> 07:16.906
Very painful, at first,
but I think it's right.

07:18.586 --> 07:23.465
I want to remember her mother
whenever I look at her.
Of course you do.

07:23.466 --> 07:26.106
And she would want to be remembered.

07:28.066 --> 07:30.425
I'll go and see Mr Travis
this afternoon.

07:30.426 --> 07:32.346
Why Mr Travis?

07:33.066 --> 07:35.145
To... fix the date.

07:35.146 --> 07:37.745
But Sybil will be Catholic.

07:37.746 --> 07:38.986
What?

07:40.186 --> 07:44.306
My daughter is Irish and
she'll be Catholic, like her father.

07:52.066 --> 07:55.466
It's time I started my morning.

08:05.946 --> 08:07.746
Mrs Patmore!

08:08.586 --> 08:10.425
Oh, Ethel.

08:10.426 --> 08:14.265
Mrs Patmore, I wonder if I could
ask for your advice. Well, I...

08:14.266 --> 08:18.345
I suppose you know
I'm working for Mrs Crawley now.
I had heard.

08:18.346 --> 08:22.105
She's been ever so kind to me
and I'd hate her to suffer for it.

08:22.106 --> 08:27.185
She's hired me as cook/housekeeper
but, to be honest,
my cooking's a little rusty.

08:27.186 --> 08:28.705
Oh, yes?

08:28.706 --> 08:32.544
She's giving a lunch party
to help her Ladyship in her sorrow.

08:32.546 --> 08:36.424
She'll tell me to keep it simple,
but I'd like to surprise her.

08:36.426 --> 08:39.544
OUR Ladyship?
Mrs Crawley wants to show sympathy.

08:39.546 --> 08:42.745
I know you don't want to stop her.
Of course not.

08:42.746 --> 08:47.385
Might you help me
prepare a few dishes? Tell me how
to make them. I'll do the work.

08:47.386 --> 08:51.465
Please? Look, I don't mean to be
rude or personal, Ethel.

08:51.466 --> 08:57.665
But Mr Carson's made it very
clear... That no-one from the house
is to have dealings with me.

08:57.666 --> 09:01.945
You're not afraid I'll corrupt YOU,
are you? I am NOT!

09:01.946 --> 09:06.426
Then why should Mrs Crawley
be punished for showing me kindness?

09:16.706 --> 09:20.585
You don't look as optimistic
as you did, Bates. Something wrong?

09:20.586 --> 09:23.505
Not that I'm aware of, Mr Durrant.
Really?

09:23.506 --> 09:25.545
You seem downcast.

09:25.546 --> 09:29.666
I wondered if some scheme
to improve your lot had gone awry.

09:31.866 --> 09:36.145
If you know
something to suggest my fortunes
have taken a turn for the worse,

09:36.146 --> 09:38.865
perhaps you'd be kind enough
to share it with me.

09:38.866 --> 09:41.585
Am I kind enough to share it
with him, Craig?

09:41.586 --> 09:42.745
No.

09:42.746 --> 09:44.746
I don't think I am.

09:50.186 --> 09:53.545
Did you hear about
Tom's announcement at breakfast?

09:53.546 --> 09:56.186
He wants the child
to be a left-footer.

09:57.426 --> 10:01.945
Papa, I know it's hard...
There hasn't been a Catholic Crawley
since the Reformation.

10:01.946 --> 10:04.185
She isn't a Crawley.
She's a Branson.

10:04.186 --> 10:08.905
The only chance that child
will have of achieving anything is
because of the blood of her mother.

10:08.906 --> 10:10.945
Well, I don't agree.

10:10.946 --> 10:13.465
And besides, Sybil...
That's another thing.

10:13.466 --> 10:17.586
I think it's ghoulish to call her
after Sybil. Well, I don't.

10:21.866 --> 10:23.945
No, there's no need to cook.

10:23.946 --> 10:28.865
Just fetch some ham from Mr Bakewell
and make a light salad.

10:28.866 --> 10:31.185
You can't go wrong with that.

10:31.186 --> 10:33.745
And Lady Grantham won't want more.

10:33.746 --> 10:37.185
I'd like to make a bit of an effort,
to show our sympathies.

10:37.186 --> 10:40.905
It's a nice idea, Ethel,
but I'd like to keep it safe.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.106
I'll walk up to the house later.

10:45.746 --> 10:49.305
What is your plan for the child?
What do you mean?

10:49.306 --> 10:51.545
Well, if Branson takes her away

10:51.546 --> 10:56.145
to live with him in Liverpool
or wherever he comes to rest.

10:56.146 --> 11:01.025
Presumably, it will be his influence
that governs her upbringing.

11:01.026 --> 11:04.865
I hadn't thought about that.
Then, I suggest you do.

11:04.866 --> 11:06.386
And soon.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.026
What does Cora say?

11:11.746 --> 11:14.746
Not much. Not much to ME, anyway.

11:15.866 --> 11:18.465
She still holds you responsible?

11:18.466 --> 11:22.146
She's wretchedly unhappy,
if that's what you mean.

11:24.306 --> 11:28.105
I will not criticise a mother
who grieves for her daughter.

11:28.106 --> 11:32.545
I think she's grieving for
her marriage, as well as for Sybil.

11:32.546 --> 11:37.706
Robert, people like us are NEVER
unhappily married.

11:39.706 --> 11:42.025
What do we do if we are?

11:42.026 --> 11:44.185
Well, in those moments,

11:44.186 --> 11:48.746
a couple is unable to see as much
of each other as they'd like.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.745
You think I should go away?

11:52.746 --> 11:56.665
Or Cora could go to New York
to see that woman.

11:56.666 --> 11:59.785
It can help
to gain a little distance.

11:59.786 --> 12:04.025
I... I can't seem to think straight
about any of it.

12:04.026 --> 12:06.026
My dearest boy.

12:06.906 --> 12:12.385
There is no test on Earth greater
than the one you've been put to.

12:12.386 --> 12:16.265
I do not speak much of the heart,

12:16.266 --> 12:18.906
since it's seldom helpful to do so.

12:20.026 --> 12:25.506
But I know well enough
the pain when it is broken.

12:28.066 --> 12:29.746
Thank you, Mama.

12:32.156 --> 12:34.975
Don't you have any work to do?
I'll clean the silver later.

12:35.044 --> 12:39.883
Mr Carson told us to wait for him.
I wouldn't mind YOUR hours!

12:39.884 --> 12:42.243
What's the matter?

12:42.244 --> 12:46.283
You look very...
Very what?

12:46.284 --> 12:48.883
I don't know exactly.
Stop gabbing, Ivy.

12:48.884 --> 12:52.723
Remember,
you've my work to do tomorrow.
You off to see the rich farmer?

12:52.724 --> 12:56.763
Whatever he makes, he earns it.
It'd be nice to be your own boss.

12:56.764 --> 13:01.963
No farmer's his own boss.
He takes his orders from the sun and
the snow and the wind and the rain.

13:01.964 --> 13:04.763
Oh, I see!
Is this the new servants' hall?

13:04.764 --> 13:08.044
What have they done
with the old one, I wonder!

13:11.964 --> 13:16.003
What are you staring at?
A cat can look at a king.

13:16.004 --> 13:22.524
Well, not at a cook!
Get on with whatever you're doing.
I'll be back before the gong.

13:26.164 --> 13:28.603
I don't know what I'm doing here.

13:28.604 --> 13:31.164
You're here because you're kind.
Am I?

13:32.364 --> 13:34.963
This is a list of what you'll need.

13:34.964 --> 13:38.403
I'll come in on Thursday
and see how you're getting on.

13:38.404 --> 13:40.603
Can I really do it? Salmon mousse?

13:40.604 --> 13:44.963
Anyone who has use of their limbs
can make a salmon mousse.

13:44.964 --> 13:49.083
Lamb chops portmanteau...
I don't know.

13:49.084 --> 13:52.843
Surely you can cut up a bit
of chicken liver and some parsley.

13:52.844 --> 13:58.764
Why not serve bread and cheese
and have done with it?
You're right. I'll give it a go.

14:05.644 --> 14:10.363
Forgive me for barging in,
but I have a little plan.

14:10.364 --> 14:14.403
Oh, goodness. You've changed.
It's much later than I realised.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.683
We're rather prompt.

14:16.684 --> 14:20.123
Robert's invited Mr Travis
to dine with us.

14:20.124 --> 14:26.083
What was your plan? I was wondering
if you and the girls might
come to me for luncheon on Thursday.

14:26.084 --> 14:28.523
Do I count as one of the girls?

14:28.524 --> 14:30.403
Of course!

14:30.404 --> 14:34.163
You're very kind, but I'm not really
going out at the moment.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.163
There'll be no-one else there.
Only me.

14:37.164 --> 14:40.763
And a walk to the village
might blow some cobwebs away.

14:40.764 --> 14:44.244
I'm afraid I would only bring
my troubles with me.

14:46.044 --> 14:48.723
Hello, Mother. What brings you here?

14:48.724 --> 14:53.683
She's just invited Cora and Edith
and Mary to luncheon on Thursday.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.804
Oh, how kind. Thank you.

14:56.884 --> 15:00.323
Isobel. Have you come for dinner?

15:00.324 --> 15:03.643
No. I'm dressed quite wrongly,
and you have a guest.

15:03.644 --> 15:06.923
I doubt Mr Travis has much of an eye
for fashion.

15:06.924 --> 15:09.644
Oh, do stay. We need cheering up.

15:14.284 --> 15:16.723
Can you manage?
Course I can.

15:16.724 --> 15:20.483
Sorry. Didn't mean to insult
your manhood.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.284
She didn't mean that, either.
Get on!

15:24.164 --> 15:28.403
Are you looking forward
to your outing with Mr Mason?
I am. It's a lovely place.

15:28.404 --> 15:31.683
You should go with her.
Or I could come out with you.

15:31.684 --> 15:37.524
The trouble with you lot, you're
all in love with the wrong people!
Take those upstairs!

15:38.564 --> 15:43.003
Isn't there something or other
un-English about the Roman Church?

15:43.004 --> 15:46.483
Since I am an Irishman,
that's not likely to bother me.

15:46.484 --> 15:53.043
I cannot feel bells and incense
and all the rest of that
pagan fodder is pleasing to God.

15:53.044 --> 15:58.203
I see. So is he not pleased by
the population of France or Italy?

15:58.204 --> 16:02.763
Not as pleased as he is
by the worship of the Anglicans. No.

16:02.764 --> 16:07.243
South America, Portugal -
have they missed the mark, too?

16:07.244 --> 16:09.723
I do not mean to sound harsh.

16:09.724 --> 16:13.603
I'm sure there are many individuals
from those lands who please him.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.923
And the Russians? And the Spanish?

16:15.924 --> 16:18.243
There must be many good Spaniards.

16:18.244 --> 16:22.363
We haven't started on
the non-Christians,
the whole Indian subcontinent.

16:22.364 --> 16:24.923
The British Empire,
does he approve of that?

16:24.924 --> 16:31.003
If you mean, does he approve of the
expansion of the Christian message?
Yes, I think he does.

16:31.004 --> 16:35.403
And so do I. Poor Mr Travis,
you're all ganging up on him.

16:35.404 --> 16:38.843
You and Granny are ganging up
against Tom. Not me!

16:38.844 --> 16:42.843
The Dowager Duchess of Norfolk
is a dear friend.

16:42.844 --> 16:45.363
And she's more Catholic
than the Pope!

16:45.364 --> 16:51.763
I simply do not think that it would
help the baby to be baptised into
a different tribe from this one.

16:51.764 --> 16:53.883
She will be baptised into my tribe.

16:53.884 --> 16:57.243
Am I the only one to stand up
for Sybil? What about her wishes?

16:57.244 --> 17:04.042
Sybil would be happy for the child
to be a Catholic. How do you make
that out? Because she said so to me.

17:04.044 --> 17:06.044
On the day she died.

17:06.884 --> 17:10.124
Did she? Oh, God! Did she really?

17:11.604 --> 17:16.363
I'm flabbergasted. You're always
flabbergasted by the unconventional.

17:16.364 --> 17:22.404
But in a family like this one!
Not everyone chooses their religion
to satisfy Debrett's.

17:23.644 --> 17:29.043
I've no wish to persecute Catholics,
but I find it hard to believe
they're loyal to the crown.

17:29.044 --> 17:33.003
It'll be a relief for them
that you no longer want them
burned at the stake.

17:33.004 --> 17:36.083
I don't believe in orthodoxy.
That's a long word.

17:36.084 --> 17:40.643
A man can choose to be different
without it making him a traitor.
I agree.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.883
I don't like discussing religion.
We'll only fall out.

17:43.884 --> 17:46.883
It's our private business.
Amen.

17:46.884 --> 17:51.083
It's funny, though, all that Latin
and smoke and men in black dresses.

17:51.084 --> 17:53.163
I'm glad I'm Church of England, me.

17:53.164 --> 17:56.923
Really? What do you feel about
transubstantiation? You what?

17:56.924 --> 18:00.523
Never mind, Alfred.
Your heart's in the right place.

18:00.524 --> 18:03.604
I can't say that for everyone
under this roof.

18:07.884 --> 18:11.723
When Sybil was talking
about the baby being a Catholic,

18:11.724 --> 18:14.164
did you get the sense that she knew?

18:15.164 --> 18:17.123
I'm not sure.

18:17.124 --> 18:19.443
Not at the time.

18:19.444 --> 18:22.004
Of course, I've asked myself since.

18:23.964 --> 18:26.803
You'd think we'd be used
to young death,

18:26.804 --> 18:29.563
after four years of war.

18:29.564 --> 18:33.244
That's why we must never
take anything for granted.

18:34.244 --> 18:38.083
Which is what I'm trying
to get Robert to see.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.044
He wasn't given Downton
by God's degree.

18:42.084 --> 18:44.604
We have to work
if we want to keep it.

18:46.164 --> 18:48.283
But not only Downton.

18:48.284 --> 18:50.083
Us.

18:50.084 --> 18:52.763
We must never take "us" for granted.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.964
Who knows what's coming?

18:56.164 --> 18:59.484
Well, I have to take one thing
for granted.

19:00.604 --> 19:06.044
That I will love you until
the last breath leaves my body.

19:06.964 --> 19:09.284
Oh, my darling! Me too.

19:10.564 --> 19:12.164
Me too.

19:14.964 --> 19:17.883
- Maggie!
- What?

19:17.884 --> 19:20.604
Meet us down the pub later!

19:25.404 --> 19:29.963
But this is quite different
from the story told before.

19:29.964 --> 19:32.844
I don't think it is.
I'm afraid so.

19:33.884 --> 19:38.723
You said you went
to Mrs Bates's house
AFTER you'd eaten your evening meal

19:38.724 --> 19:41.603
and she was in the process
of cooking hers.

19:41.604 --> 19:45.123
I had just eaten when I saw her,
that's true.

19:45.124 --> 19:47.124
But it was dinner at midday.

19:47.924 --> 19:51.524
Mr Bates was going to call on her
that afternoon.

19:53.004 --> 19:54.523
But, er...

19:54.524 --> 19:58.843
you described how the light
from the gas lamps

19:58.844 --> 20:03.004
caught the rain
and made a kind of... halo round her.

20:04.244 --> 20:08.883
That sounds rather fanciful for me.
So, you do not remember saying it?

20:08.884 --> 20:12.084
I don't remember
because I never said it.

20:14.044 --> 20:15.604
I see.

20:18.364 --> 20:22.043
As a matter of interest,
why did you let me come today

20:22.044 --> 20:25.404
if nothing you could say
would alter the verdict?

20:26.764 --> 20:30.364
I thought it was time
you saw how real people live.

20:45.004 --> 20:48.723
Where's Daisy?
Gone off to play the milkmaid.

20:48.724 --> 20:52.523
Do you like dancing?
Everyone likes dancing.

20:52.524 --> 20:55.363
I love the foxtrot, don't you?
It's all right.

20:55.364 --> 20:59.763
What about you, Alfred?
Alfred wouldn't do the foxtrot,
would you, Alfred?

20:59.764 --> 21:03.083
He takes himself too seriously
for that. Well, I love it.

21:03.084 --> 21:05.884
I think it makes you glad
to be young.

21:30.484 --> 21:33.563
Me? Run this farm? Are you serious?

21:33.564 --> 21:36.723
Not right away. But eventually.

21:36.724 --> 21:42.923
But I'm a cook! You think
there's no cooking on a farm?
You could do a cracking trade.

21:42.924 --> 21:47.123
With jams and jellies
and cake and all sorts.

21:47.124 --> 21:49.603
You could sell 'em at the fairs.

21:49.604 --> 21:52.403
But I'm a woman.
Are you?

21:52.404 --> 21:54.324
Well, I never knew that!

21:56.244 --> 21:59.323
There are widows
who take on a tenancy.

21:59.324 --> 22:03.483
You're liked in the big house.
They'll not refuse you.

22:03.484 --> 22:06.284
I own the equipment, all the stock.

22:08.524 --> 22:10.603
And I've quite a bit put by.

22:10.604 --> 22:13.843
It's hard work,
but you're used to that.

22:13.844 --> 22:16.403
I can't answer now.
No, of course not.

22:16.404 --> 22:18.404
But think on it.

22:22.684 --> 22:24.963
And think on this and all.

22:24.964 --> 22:28.603
My dream would be
if you were to come here

22:28.604 --> 22:31.283
and live with me
so I could teach you.

22:31.284 --> 22:34.284
But I always thought
I'd spend my life in service.

22:35.764 --> 22:38.363
You have 40 years of work
ahead of you.

22:38.364 --> 22:44.603
Do you think these great houses
like Downton Abbey are going to
go on just as they are for 40 years?

22:44.604 --> 22:46.724
Because I don't.

22:48.604 --> 22:51.843
You wanted to speak to me,
Lady Grantham. Yes.

22:51.844 --> 22:54.683
On a melancholy matter I'm afraid.
Please.

22:54.684 --> 23:00.124
I want to talk a little more about
the death of my granddaughter.

23:01.164 --> 23:03.763
A terrible, terrible tragedy.

23:03.764 --> 23:06.643
But now I am concerned beyond that.

23:06.644 --> 23:11.523
Oh? Are you worried for the child?
No, not especially.

23:11.524 --> 23:15.083
She seems quite a tough
little thing.

23:15.084 --> 23:19.963
Dr Clarkson, my daughter-in-law
is quite convinced

23:19.964 --> 23:24.523
you could have saved Sybil,
had you been allowed to.

23:24.524 --> 23:28.763
One can never speak of these things
with any certainty.

23:28.764 --> 23:34.443
Well, this is the point. What was
the likelihood of Sybil's survival?

23:34.444 --> 23:38.123
Had we operated?
She might have lived.

23:38.124 --> 23:44.083
There are cases where an early
Caesarian saved the mother
after pre-eclampsia. How many cases?

23:44.084 --> 23:47.963
Not many, I admit.
I'd need to do some research.

23:47.964 --> 23:53.563
I want you
to tell Lord and Lady Grantham
what you have almost admitted to me.

23:53.564 --> 23:57.323
But... But there WAS a chance.

23:57.324 --> 23:59.643
Dr Clarkson,

23:59.644 --> 24:04.403
you have created a division
between my son and his wife,

24:04.404 --> 24:09.123
when the only way they can
conceivably bear their grief

24:09.124 --> 24:11.563
is if they face it together.

24:11.564 --> 24:15.803
So you want me to lie to them,
say there was no chance at all?

24:15.804 --> 24:17.843
"Lie"...

24:17.844 --> 24:20.404
is so unmusical a word.

24:22.244 --> 24:25.163
I want you to review the evidence

24:25.164 --> 24:28.003
honestly and without bias.

24:28.004 --> 24:32.844
Even to ease suffering,
I could never justify telling
an outright lie.

24:34.484 --> 24:37.124
Have we NOTHING in common?

24:38.519 --> 24:42.598
It's badly run. It makes no sense
to manage it separately.

24:42.599 --> 24:45.318
What about the tenant?
We'd look after him.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.358
He's growing barley and wheat.

24:47.359 --> 24:50.758
He'd do better with sheep.
Exactly. We'd merge the grazing.

24:50.759 --> 24:55.638
How do you know that?
How do YOU, after spending
your growing years in Manchester!

24:55.639 --> 24:59.838
I've been on a steep learning curve
since arriving at Downton.

24:59.839 --> 25:03.679
My grandfather was a tenant farmer
in Galway, black-faced sheep.

25:04.559 --> 25:07.738
So there's a country boy
inside the revolutionary?

25:07.829 --> 25:09.789
Not much of one.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.869
You must hate it here.

25:13.949 --> 25:16.109
No. I don't hate it.

25:17.069 --> 25:19.388
But I don't belong here, either.

25:19.389 --> 25:22.308
What will you do?
I thought of Liverpool.

25:22.309 --> 25:24.908
There might be something
for me there.

25:24.909 --> 25:27.188
And the baby?

25:27.189 --> 25:31.588
I'll hire a woman or get a cousin
over to take care of her.

25:31.589 --> 25:33.748
I don't know.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.869
What else can I do?

25:37.429 --> 25:39.509
You could leave her here.

25:40.829 --> 25:43.669
No. I'll not be separated from her.

25:45.909 --> 25:48.549
She's all I have left of her mother.

25:54.029 --> 25:57.028
Right, you know what you're doing?

25:57.029 --> 25:59.068
I think so. Yes.

25:59.069 --> 26:05.428
Use an alarm clock to remind you
when to put things in the oven
and when to take them out. I will.

26:05.429 --> 26:07.349
You've done well, Ethel.

26:08.429 --> 26:11.588
Maybe you've also done yourself
a favour.

26:11.589 --> 26:13.749
I'm very grateful.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.108
I expected her to deny everything

26:39.109 --> 26:42.668
the moment she realised
her testimony would release me.

26:42.669 --> 26:46.228
You know she did say
every word of it. Of course.

26:46.229 --> 26:50.948
But I'm afraid someone tipped
her off before I went to see her.

26:50.949 --> 26:52.949
I think I know who.

26:54.709 --> 26:57.588
The question remains
as to what we do next.

26:57.589 --> 27:01.428
I wonder what Mrs Bartlett
is thinking at this moment.

27:01.429 --> 27:06.068
That she's glad Mr Bates
is still in prison. I'm not sure.

27:06.069 --> 27:10.348
It's a big thing for a woman
like that to lie to a lawyer,

27:10.349 --> 27:12.588
to flout the law.

27:12.589 --> 27:16.389
They would have bribed her to do it,
or frightened her.

27:17.429 --> 27:20.909
Well, we cannot offer a bribe.

27:22.029 --> 27:25.748
But perhaps we can try
to... persuade her

27:25.749 --> 27:28.348
into returning to the path of truth.

27:28.349 --> 27:32.348
Let me see what I can do.
Nothing foolish.

27:32.349 --> 27:35.469
You mustn't do anything stupid.
Promise me.

27:37.829 --> 27:40.029
Leave it with me, Mr Murray.

27:43.709 --> 27:46.668
I don't understand.
I can smell cooking.

27:46.669 --> 27:51.108
It's quite simple, ma'am. You'll be
pleased, I promise. I've had help.

27:51.109 --> 27:54.029
And I suppose there's no ham
and no salad?

27:55.829 --> 28:00.269
If this luncheon is a failure,
Ethel, I shall hold you responsible.

28:02.509 --> 28:05.948
I'm sorry if I've kept you waiting.

28:05.949 --> 28:11.188
It's good of you to spare the time.
I've only the men to cook for today
and they're easy.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.428
What were you doing
at Crawley House?

28:13.429 --> 28:18.268
Who says I was at Crawley House?
I saw you coming out. Oh. I see.

28:18.269 --> 28:21.788
Well, Mrs Crawley was giving
a luncheon party and I...

28:21.789 --> 28:24.788
And you were helping Ethel.
I suppose I was.

28:24.789 --> 28:28.828
Against my strict instructions
to give the place a wide berth.

28:28.829 --> 28:33.588
Now, Mr Carson, no-one disputes your
position as head of this household,

28:33.589 --> 28:38.348
but I'm not sure you're entitled to
dress down Mrs Patmore in this way.

28:38.349 --> 28:42.988
If Mrs Patmore wants to spend her
time frolicking with prostitutes...

28:42.989 --> 28:48.348
Do I look like a frolicker?
May I ask who's expected
at this precious luncheon?

28:48.349 --> 28:51.789
Her Ladyship, the young Ladies
and the Dowager.

28:52.789 --> 28:55.988
You have allowed
a woman of the street

28:55.989 --> 28:59.549
to wait at table
on members of our family?

29:00.549 --> 29:02.189
I am speechless!

29:05.549 --> 29:09.188
I would guess he won't stay
speechless for long.

29:09.189 --> 29:12.828
I need to spend a day
with the agents to talk it through.

29:12.829 --> 29:15.628
Jarvis has a lot on his plate.
Yes, of course, but...

29:15.629 --> 29:19.148
Must we discuss this now?
It's very boring for Tom. I don't...

29:19.149 --> 29:23.348
Tom is your son-in-law and his
daughter is your only grandchild.

29:23.349 --> 29:28.388
None of which gives him a word
in running this place, or would
you involve Carson or the maids...?

29:28.389 --> 29:32.308
I really... We have to act
if we are to avoid another crisis.

29:32.309 --> 29:36.108
Capital is leaking into the cracks
caused by bad management.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.109
Bad management?

29:39.309 --> 29:41.469
We'll discuss it later.

29:45.109 --> 29:47.908
My Lord, I wonder if
I could have a word? Can't it wait?

29:47.909 --> 29:50.349
No, my Lord. It can't.

29:55.909 --> 30:00.628
Mr Carson's got a bee in his bonnet.
What's that about? Never you mind.

30:00.629 --> 30:02.828
Ivy, have you been running?

30:02.829 --> 30:07.348
No. Why? Your colour's up.
Hope you're not coming down
with something.

30:07.349 --> 30:10.708
How was your day off, Daisy?
Lovely, thank you.

30:10.709 --> 30:14.468
What are you doing...
with your day off?

30:14.469 --> 30:17.829
What I usually do.
Go somewhere on my own.

30:19.029 --> 30:21.988
You never give up, do you?
He's not interested.

30:21.989 --> 30:25.788
He must be interested in someone.
He's young, isn't he?

30:25.789 --> 30:27.949
But that someone is not you.

30:32.109 --> 30:35.589
How was Mr Mason?
Very well. As nice as usual.

30:36.789 --> 30:38.749
What is it?

30:39.509 --> 30:41.588
He wants me to live at the farm.

30:41.589 --> 30:48.148
Because he wants to leave me the
tenancy and all his stock and tools
and all his money and everything.

30:48.149 --> 30:50.948
My lord! You're a proper heiress.

30:50.949 --> 30:54.228
I haven't said yes, yet.
He's made the offer.

30:54.229 --> 30:58.428
A very generous one it is, too.
He's ever so generous.

30:58.429 --> 31:00.469
And so kind.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.308
This was very good.

31:07.309 --> 31:10.868
It was. It really was.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.068
Don't sound so surprised.
I am surprised.

31:14.069 --> 31:17.989
I owe Ethel an apology.
I've underestimated her.

31:18.989 --> 31:22.148
I sometimes wonder
if I should learn to cook. Why?

31:22.149 --> 31:26.908
It might come in handy one day.
And I've got to do something.

31:26.909 --> 31:32.708
What did you say to that editor
who wanted you to write for him?
I haven't said anything yet.

31:32.709 --> 31:34.628
It's probably too late now.

31:34.629 --> 31:37.868
Matthew says Robert was against it.
What difference does that make?

31:37.869 --> 31:42.428
Oh, really! My dear, ssh!
We're all family.
I'm not letting the side down.

31:42.429 --> 31:48.909
I'm just saying Robert frequently
makes decisions based on values
that have no relevance any more.

31:50.429 --> 31:55.068
Do you think I should do it?
I wouldn't countermand your father.

31:55.069 --> 32:00.148
Then why bring it up?
Well, I do, and so does Matthew.

32:00.149 --> 32:05.148
And so does Matthew what? What else
has Matthew decided for my family?

32:05.149 --> 32:09.068
Robert? Don't worry,
I don't need to be fed. We're going.

32:09.069 --> 32:11.148
All of you.
What are you talking about?

32:11.149 --> 32:15.508
Do you know
who has prepared this luncheon?
Yes, Ethel, our former housemaid.

32:15.509 --> 32:18.708
Who bore a bastard child.
W-what?

32:18.709 --> 32:21.628
Robert, Ethel has rebuilt her life.

32:21.629 --> 32:25.308
Do you know what she has built
it into? What do you mean?

32:25.309 --> 32:29.589
I think cousin Robert is referring
to Ethel's work as a prostitute.

32:33.669 --> 32:38.028
Well, of course, these days,
servants are very hard to find.

32:38.029 --> 32:43.508
You don't understand the
difficulties she's faced. I couldn't
care less how she earns a living.

32:43.509 --> 32:46.988
I care that you have exposed my
family to scandal. Who would know?

32:46.989 --> 32:51.069
People find out these things.
Your gardener, your kitchen maid...

32:56.229 --> 33:00.509
I suppose she has an appropriate
costume for every activity.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.028
We are leaving.

33:04.029 --> 33:09.308
Is this because of me, my Lord?
No, it's because of his Lordship.
We're not leaving.

33:09.309 --> 33:12.628
Is that a Charlotte Russe?
How delicious!

33:12.629 --> 33:15.109
I hope it's tasty, my Lady.

33:16.069 --> 33:18.148
Mrs Patmore gave me some help.

33:18.149 --> 33:22.269
I'm glad to know that Mrs Patmore
has a good heart and does not judge.

33:24.149 --> 33:26.269
Is anyone coming?

33:29.949 --> 33:33.029
Seems a pity
to miss such a good pudding.

33:51.149 --> 33:54.469
Who got Mrs Bartlett to change
her evidence? Who's Mrs...

33:56.589 --> 34:00.508
Durrant. Now Durrant is going to
tell her the police are on to her.

34:00.509 --> 34:04.788
She'll wind up inside
if she doesn't change her story.
To what? The truth!

34:04.789 --> 34:10.068
Or else what? I tell the governor
you and Durrant are bringing
in drugs. That's a lie!

34:10.069 --> 34:14.349
Durrant will lose his job and you
will stay here five years longer.

34:21.989 --> 34:26.228
No. He went down there and told
them, and none of them came away.

34:26.228 --> 34:29.228
Not even the Dowager? My, my.

34:29.228 --> 34:33.348
Perhaps the world is becoming
a kinder place. You say "kinder".

34:33.349 --> 34:36.068
I say "weaker"
and "less disciplined".

34:36.069 --> 34:41.628
Well, if her Ladyship is prepared
to visit Crawley House, I dare say
you won't object when I do.

34:41.629 --> 34:44.507
I won't forbid it
because I have no right to do so.

34:44.509 --> 34:47.629
But I do object,
with every fibre of my being.

34:48.949 --> 34:50.949
You disappoint me.

34:52.589 --> 34:56.349
I never thought of you
as a woman with no standards.

35:00.789 --> 35:04.068
I wish you'd come back
to the drawing room.

35:04.069 --> 35:07.068
I'd only set your mother's teeth
on edge.

35:07.069 --> 35:09.068
She'll come through it.

35:09.069 --> 35:10.669
She will.

35:12.069 --> 35:15.348
Which brings me
to your... performance today.

35:15.349 --> 35:17.708
How did that help?

35:17.709 --> 35:22.068
I was angry with Isobel
for exposing you all to gossip.

35:22.069 --> 35:24.348
You were angry all right.

35:24.349 --> 35:26.749
But not with Isobel or Ethel.

35:27.909 --> 35:31.428
I think it's because the world
isn't going your way.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.268
Not any more.

35:33.269 --> 35:36.588
Has Matthew told you about
his latest plans for Downton?

35:36.589 --> 35:39.788
I know he wants to change things.
Doesn't he just?

35:39.789 --> 35:44.068
You mustn't let him upset you.
He more or less told me
I've let the estate fall to pieces.

35:44.069 --> 35:46.589
I'm sure he didn't mean that.
Didn't he?

35:47.429 --> 35:50.268
A fool and his money
are soon parted.

35:50.269 --> 35:54.629
I have been parted from my money,
so I suppose I am a fool.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.509
You won't win over the christening.

36:00.949 --> 36:04.268
Not if you're against me.
I'm never against you.

36:04.269 --> 36:06.949
But you've lost on this one.

36:08.429 --> 36:10.709
Did Sybil truly not mind?

36:11.869 --> 36:14.029
She wanted Tom to be happy.

36:14.989 --> 36:18.148
She loved him very much, you know.

36:18.149 --> 36:20.229
We all need to remember that.

36:22.989 --> 36:25.109
I keep forgetting she's gone.

36:27.629 --> 36:30.989
I see things in the paper
that would make her laugh.

36:32.149 --> 36:36.508
I come inside to tell her
that her favourite rose is in bloom.

36:36.509 --> 36:38.589
And then, suddenly...

36:44.549 --> 36:46.948
Say that to Mama.

36:46.949 --> 36:48.828
Please.

36:48.829 --> 36:52.029
She doesn't want to hear it from me.

37:07.865 --> 37:09.944
How's she doing?

37:10.241 --> 37:12.441
She's blooming.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.560
They STAYED in the house,
even after they knew?

37:39.561 --> 37:42.920
I expect they didn't want
to insult Mrs Crawley.

37:42.921 --> 37:46.160
I couldn't have swallowed
another bite once I knew.

37:46.161 --> 37:48.400
Jesus managed to eat
with Mary Magdalene.

37:48.401 --> 37:53.440
We can't be sure he ate with her.
He allowed her to wash his feet.
I see.

37:53.441 --> 37:57.681
Well, I'll tell Ethel
she has a treat in store!

37:58.321 --> 38:01.560
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, but...

38:01.561 --> 38:04.800
Ivy! We haven't finished yet.

38:04.801 --> 38:07.481
We've never finished.

38:08.841 --> 38:10.880
What's this?

38:10.881 --> 38:12.720
Rouge?

38:12.721 --> 38:15.160
Have you been painting your face?

38:15.161 --> 38:18.440
It's not like the old days,
Mrs Patmore. All the girls do it.

38:18.441 --> 38:21.440
Not in THIS house, Miss Hussy.
Go and wash!

38:21.441 --> 38:23.841
We'll see no more of it.

38:26.281 --> 38:29.920
It's nice to know we've another
piano player in the house.

38:29.921 --> 38:31.920
Unless you think it's too soon.

38:31.921 --> 38:35.880
Oh, no.
Lady Sybil was a bright young thing.

38:35.881 --> 38:40.040
She'd be glad of some music.
You play well, James.

38:40.041 --> 38:43.241
There's no end to Jimmy's talents,
is there?

38:45.721 --> 38:47.681
His Lordship wants you.

38:53.161 --> 38:55.840
I wish he wouldn't do that.
What?

38:55.841 --> 38:59.840
He's always touching me. I'm going
to tell Mr Carson. You'd never.

38:59.841 --> 39:02.841
I'd tell the flippin' police
if it'd make him stop.

39:03.801 --> 39:06.680
I must go.
I need to fetch some linen.

39:06.681 --> 39:08.881
Her Ladyship won't be long now.

39:19.281 --> 39:21.240
What are you doing?

39:21.241 --> 39:23.760
Nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.720
Can you dance the foxtrot?

39:25.721 --> 39:28.200
I think so. Yeah, I can.

39:28.201 --> 39:30.280
Would you teach me?

39:30.281 --> 39:32.600
Well, I'm supposed to lay the tea.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.721
And here's me thinking
you'd like to dance with me.

39:37.761 --> 39:39.760
Go on, then.

39:39.761 --> 39:42.080
How do you put the hands?
Like this.

39:42.081 --> 39:45.440
That foot goes back first.

39:45.441 --> 39:49.560
Right?
Yeah. It goes slow, slow...

39:49.561 --> 39:52.720
quick, quick, slow.

39:52.721 --> 39:56.160
Slow, quick, quick, slow.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.681
Slow, quick, quick.

40:10.321 --> 40:13.440
M'lady, it's arrived.

40:13.441 --> 40:17.560
It's here. I wanted you to be
the first to know. What's arrived?

40:17.561 --> 40:19.880
He's done it. Mr Murray's done it.

40:19.881 --> 40:25.120
He's got her to make a statement,
witnessed and everything.
So when will Bates be set free?

40:25.121 --> 40:29.200
It'll take a few weeks for the
formalities, but he'll be released.

40:29.201 --> 40:33.560
Mr Murray's quite clear about that.
So Mr Bates is coming home.

40:33.561 --> 40:36.560
Oh, I'm so, so happy for you.
I know you are.

40:36.561 --> 40:39.160
Have you told Papa?
Not yet, m'lady.

40:39.161 --> 40:41.840
Well, do. Please do.
He's very low just now.

40:41.841 --> 40:45.321
It will be wonderful for him
to hear something good.

40:52.121 --> 40:55.001
Have you seen this note from Mama?

40:56.201 --> 40:59.680
I have. I wonder what she wants.

40:59.681 --> 41:03.481
I can stand anything
but a lecture on marital harmony.

41:07.361 --> 41:11.441
Do we have to go?
I think so. We needn't stay long.

41:12.121 --> 41:13.601
Good.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.241
You look very nice this morning.

41:19.401 --> 41:22.241
Don't flirt with me, Robert.
Not now.

41:33.561 --> 41:39.920
I'm ever so sorry to interrupt,
my Lord, but Mrs Bartlett has given
a statement that'll clear him.

41:39.921 --> 41:44.440
At least, Mr Murray says
it will "make the verdict unsafe".

41:44.441 --> 41:47.160
So Mr Bates is coming back
to Downton.

41:47.161 --> 41:50.480
Isn't it marvellous?
Yes, that is absolutely marvellous!

41:50.481 --> 41:54.000
Do you want to telephone Murray?
If you do, tell Carson.

41:54.001 --> 41:56.881
He'll manage it for you.
Why? Are you going out?

41:57.721 --> 42:01.920
Your grandmother has asked us to
call. I'll hear what he says later.

42:01.921 --> 42:04.801
I really am so very glad.

42:09.561 --> 42:13.840
Excuse me!
What are YOU doing here?

42:13.841 --> 42:16.640
I'm sorry, Mr Carson.
I want to thank Mrs Patmore.

42:16.641 --> 42:20.320
I brought these flowers. There are
plenty in the gardens here.

42:20.321 --> 42:22.360
How nice of you, Ethel.

42:22.361 --> 42:24.761
Mrs Patmore is in the kitchen.

42:26.721 --> 42:30.000
I hope YOU never need a favour
from your fellow man.

42:30.001 --> 42:33.840
You can talk as tough as you like.
I know YOU won't abandon me.

42:33.841 --> 42:39.481
Why doesn't that thought
make you kinder?
Because I am who I am, Mrs Hughes.

42:43.041 --> 42:45.841
Slow, slow, quick, quick. Go back.
Slow...

42:47.481 --> 42:51.120
Look at the pair of you.
Alfie's learning the foxtrot.

42:51.121 --> 42:54.440
I bet he is, but he's going to have
to do better than that.

42:54.441 --> 42:58.120
What do you mean? He's only
learning it to please our Ivy.

42:58.121 --> 43:00.480
Aren't you, m'laddo?
Is that true?

43:00.481 --> 43:03.080
Well... Of course it is,
you runner bean.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.841
Step aside,
let me show you how it's done.

43:13.761 --> 43:16.480
What is going on here?

43:16.481 --> 43:19.480
At a time like this,
of sober dignity!

43:19.481 --> 43:23.840
Have you lost all sense of shame
and propriety, sir?

43:23.841 --> 43:27.040
What makes you think
you're the stuff of a first footman?

43:27.041 --> 43:29.920
Alfred looks like
a first footman to me.

43:29.921 --> 43:33.840
Take a leaf from his book and learn
to conduct yourself with discretion.

43:33.841 --> 43:36.840
But, Mr Carson, he was the one...
Silence.

43:36.841 --> 43:39.400
You're a disgrace to your livery.

43:39.401 --> 43:42.080
And as for you, Daisy,

43:42.081 --> 43:44.921
have your years here
taught you nothing?

43:49.561 --> 43:51.961
Thanks for speaking up

43:57.041 --> 43:59.920
I don't suppose you want
to practise... I'm very busy.

43:59.921 --> 44:03.081
Why don't you ask Ivy
if she's got any spare time?

44:10.521 --> 44:14.440
Dr Clarkson!
Lady Grantham, how are you?

44:14.441 --> 44:16.920
Much as you'd expect me to be.

44:16.921 --> 44:21.760
Dr Clarkson has something
to tell you which may alter
your view a little.

44:21.761 --> 44:25.120
I don't mean to be discourteous,
but I doubt it.

44:25.121 --> 44:29.200
Since you're here,
I have a few words of my own to say.

44:29.201 --> 44:32.560
I feel I owe you an apology.
Please, Lord Grantham.

44:32.561 --> 44:34.801
If you'll just allow me.

44:36.201 --> 44:38.360
On that awful night...

44:38.361 --> 44:43.560
I'm afraid I may have given you
the impression that my recommended
course of treatment

44:43.561 --> 44:46.641
offered a real chance
for Lady Sybil's survival.

44:47.721 --> 44:52.840
The truth, and I've done
a great deal of research since,
as you can imagine,

44:52.841 --> 44:55.561
is that the chance was a small one.

44:57.121 --> 45:03.280
A tiny one, really. I'd read
that early delivery was the only way
to avoid the trauma, and it is.

45:03.281 --> 45:05.601
As you tried so hard to tell us.

45:06.681 --> 45:09.920
But... what I did not quite realise

45:09.921 --> 45:13.480
was that eclampsia
is almost invariably fatal,

45:13.481 --> 45:15.761
with or without a Caesarian.

45:16.721 --> 45:23.800
Had you agreed, we would have
subjected Lady Sybil to the fear
and pain of a hurried operation.

45:23.801 --> 45:28.080
When, in all likelihood,
she would have died anyway.

45:28.081 --> 45:29.400
But...

45:29.401 --> 45:31.361
there was a CHANCE.

45:36.001 --> 45:38.560
An infinitesimal one.

45:38.561 --> 45:43.280
The discomfort and the terror
would have been all too certain.

45:43.281 --> 45:47.640
So you think Tapsell was right?
Oh, I can't go that far.

45:47.641 --> 45:53.720
Sir Philip Tapsell ignored
all the evidence in a most unhelpful
and arrogant manner.

45:53.721 --> 45:55.881
But Sybil was going to die.

46:01.761 --> 46:04.560
When everything is weighed
in the balance,

46:04.561 --> 46:08.441
I believe that Lady Sybil
was going to die.

46:15.561 --> 46:17.881
And now I'll take my leave.
