Mrs. Thornton, Nathan Grant.

00:07.721 --> 00:09.292
A pleasure to meet you.

00:09.535 --> 00:12.379
Lucas Bouchard, at your service.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.676
You cheated me out of my land.

00:15.701 --> 00:17.093
I'm going to get what's mine.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.920
Judge will be here first
thing in the morning.

00:18.945 --> 00:20.241
I think you'd make a good judge.

00:20.266 --> 00:21.296
I'm the judge.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.054
Sworn in last night.

00:23.133 --> 00:26.022
You are not the man
people think you are.

00:26.047 --> 00:28.429
I think it's time you
stopped living in the past.

to get close to her.</i>

00:33.978 --> 00:36.394
Alright, well, what do you suggest?

00:36.419 --> 00:38.554
Do you think they're onto us?

00:38.916 --> 00:40.861
<i>They are now.</i>

00:41.677 --> 00:44.321
I know how much you want
a child of your own.

00:44.346 --> 00:46.146
What if it doesn't happen for us?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.771
We face it together.

That's great.

02:45.046 --> 02:47.285
Between her friends, and the projects,

I've never seen her so
engaged with school.

That's good, you know.

02:50.455 --> 02:52.891
I was... I was never like that.

02:52.916 --> 02:56.193
Probably because you never had
a teacher like Elizabeth.

02:58.401 --> 02:59.862
That, that's true.

02:59.893 --> 03:01.720

Yes, and there are some
real gems in this one.

Yeah, that's nice. That's really fancy.

Well, I want to look my absolute
best for our anniversary.

04:07.741 --> 04:10.242
from back when they were
wanna-be stage actors.

04:10.267 --> 04:12.376
I'm pretty sure the only matinee
idols we're going to see

04:12.401 --> 04:14.127
are on the screen at a movie theatre.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.432
Oh, speaking of which,

04:15.457 --> 04:17.857
I read that Gloria

04:17.882 --> 04:20.250
is going to be playing at
Tally's Electric Theatre.

04:20.274 --> 04:22.110
Okay, add it to the itinerary then.

04:22.135 --> 04:26.358
Mmmhmm. Along with concerts,
world-class dining, some vaudeville.

04:26.682 --> 04:30.823
And then I thought we could take
a jaunt down Sunset Boulevard.

04:30.848 --> 04:32.849
I hear that is <i> the</i> place to be seen.

04:32.874 --> 04:33.940
Absolutely, yes.

04:33.965 --> 04:36.779
Oh, Lee, you really do need a vacation

04:36.804 --> 04:39.146

work you've been doing.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.256

She edited it; actually she
edited quite a few of these.

Your mother was an editor?

Helen Bouchard.

Now, I see where your
interest in books came from.

06:45.194 --> 06:46.766
Been around them for most of my life.

06:46.799 --> 06:47.953
So, what was it like,

06:47.978 --> 06:49.653
having a mother who did
this for a living?

06:49.678 --> 06:51.979
I remember sitting with her
when she read manuscripts;

06:52.004 --> 06:54.051
she would quote Benjamin Franklin:

06:54.113 --> 06:56.013
"Either write something worth reading

06:56.038 --> 06:57.940
"or do something worth writing."

06:57.965 --> 06:59.477
Huh?

06:59.598 --> 07:01.718
She never took an interest
in writing herself?

07:01.906 --> 07:03.473
It wasn't her calling;

07:03.885 --> 07:06.762
besides, she saw how difficult
it was to get published so.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.961
No kidding.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.031
That sounds like experience talking.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.216
I tried to get something
published a few years ago.

07:15.241 --> 07:16.471
It didn't work out.

07:16.496 --> 07:19.665

or something more?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.560

07:21.603 --> 07:24.235

reckoned with even then.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.392
Two.

07:33.678 --> 07:35.094
Just two?

07:36.056 --> 07:38.701

You've had an impressive career.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.115
You could say that.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.604
You're quite the leader in this town.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.843
I definitely wouldn't say that.

And then there's the conviction

11:18.041 --> 11:20.776
Yes, there is that.

11:21.141 --> 11:23.682

and builds himself back up.

11:28.032 --> 11:30.705

12:24.542 --> 12:27.093
[SIGHS] I told Lucas

I remember meeting this young
English actor in New York City.

Frankly, Judge, I'm hoping
more than he told me.

All the man wants to talk about is oil.

13:02.264 --> 13:04.434
Well, isn't that what
your article is about?

13:04.515 --> 13:06.067
That's the jumping off point.

13:22.648 --> 13:24.275
- Did he say that?
- No, no.

You've certainly given
me a lot to think about.

22:04.569 --> 22:07.254
I guess I should be going
back to the saloon.

22:07.639 --> 22:09.083
This was really nice of you.

22:09.108 --> 22:10.574
My pleasure.

22:18.186 --> 22:21.733
Your stories are good,
but they could be great.

22:22.302 --> 22:24.080
My mother always used to tell me,

22:24.105 --> 22:27.359
'that the best writing comes
right from the heart.'

Thank you.

Hey Bill.

22:48.681 --> 22:49.704
Hey.

22:49.729 --> 22:50.994
Why the suit?

22:51.502 --> 22:52.788
What?

22:52.899 --> 22:54.421
I wear a suit from time to time.

22:54.446 --> 22:56.349
No, you don't.

22:56.882 --> 22:58.726
Aren't you supposed to be on a train?

22:58.751 --> 23:00.910
- That was postponed
- Everything ok?

23:00.935 --> 23:02.754
Ah, just work. Hmm.

23:02.779 --> 23:04.059
How's Rosemary with that?

23:04.084 --> 23:06.669
Ugh. She was really looking
forward to this trip.

23:06.706 --> 23:09.862
Lee, the whole town has been
talking about the movies,

23:09.887 --> 23:12.124
and the sand, and the sun.

23:12.149 --> 23:14.322
I hope you have a plan
to make it up to her?

23:14.584 --> 23:15.788
You're right.

23:15.835 --> 23:17.501
I need a plan to make it up to her.

something like this?

23:26.410 --> 23:27.452
It's nice.

23:27.477 --> 23:28.819
Don't you just love the lace?

23:28.844 --> 23:32.213
Mmmhmm, yeah. It's nice.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.720
Don't you have anything
to say but 'nice'.

23:34.745 --> 23:36.528
I don't know anything about dresses.

23:36.553 --> 23:39.220
But I do know you could
be wearing a potato sack

23:39.245 --> 23:41.455
and you'd still be the most
beautiful woman in the room.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.491
Oh, that's really sweet.

23:43.852 --> 23:46.017
But I still want your
thoughts on these dresses.

23:46.042 --> 23:47.341
Okay.

23:47.366 --> 23:49.595
Well, it looks like you're
partial to long sleeves.

23:49.627 --> 23:51.736
Because I was thinking of
having an outdoor wedding.

23:51.761 --> 23:52.777
Outdoor?

23:52.802 --> 23:53.834
- Mmmhmm.
- Sure.

23:53.859 --> 23:56.594
That way we could
invite the whole town.

23:56.929 --> 23:59.196
The whole town, wow.

23:59.221 --> 24:02.478
See, I was thinking we'd limit
it to family and close friends.

24:02.503 --> 24:04.438
But I've always dreamed
of having a big wedding.

24:04.463 --> 24:05.866
Your first one was small?

24:05.891 --> 24:07.689
Smaller than small.

24:09.897 --> 24:14.508
Then we're going to make this
the wedding of your dreams.

Haven't you already interviewed
a bunch of people?

24:58.887 --> 25:01.587
A few, but everyone's
been pretty tight-lipped

25:01.623 --> 25:03.625
about Henry Gowen's past.

25:03.650 --> 25:05.650
I don't like telling half a story.

You know, people here
have their differences,

25:08.010 --> 25:11.394
but I've found they
usually stick together.

You've been in Hope Valley long?

25:13.264 --> 25:14.417
Not long at all.

25:14.442 --> 25:16.143
I came here from San Francisco.

25:16.168 --> 25:17.516
What brought you here?

25:17.541 --> 25:20.290
The town had trouble getting
their telephones to work.

Besides, Lucas had to tell
you all about his books.

That reporter wanted to talk to me.

27:14.257 --> 27:17.251
Well, I'm guessing, she
just wanted some dirt.

Well, what she wanted and what she got,

28:13.408 --> 28:14.570
He did.

you got a bad hand.

29:22.753 --> 29:23.788
I've got a 'look'?

Faith was offered this
great job in Hamilton.

she's gonna take it or not.

stay, she may leave you.
