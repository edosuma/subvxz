00:01.100 --> 00:03.900
Oh, look at these headlines.

00:03.966 --> 00:06.200
‐ This is so depressing.
‐ 'I know.'

00:06.266 --> 00:09.566
Says here, "Designers predict
wider lapels next season."

00:09.633 --> 00:11.933
I don't even know
why I read the paper.

00:14.233 --> 00:18.066
‐ Morning, people.
‐ Hey, check you out.

00:18.133 --> 00:22.400
‐ You must have a job interview.
‐ O‐oh, girl, that is great.

00:22.466 --> 00:24.966
And here is a little
somethin' for good luck, huh!

00:25.033 --> 00:27.000
It's a runnin' tab
of all the food

00:27.066 --> 00:28.800
you've eaten here
while you were unemployed

00:28.866 --> 00:32.165
and it is even itemized
for your convenience.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.900
Good try, Regine,
but I don't have an interview.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.466
I'm heading to the court house
to scout for anyone

00:37.533 --> 00:39.833
who looks like
they might need a lawyer.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.933
How are you gonna
be able to tell?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.166
If they're in a holding cell,
it's kind of a tip off.

00:46.866 --> 00:49.366
You know what, they'll be
very lucky to have someone

00:49.433 --> 00:51.833
as professional as you are.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.133
I know.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.400
That's why I made up these
coupons in eye catching colors.

00:57.733 --> 01:00.233
And if I'm there
when the felony bus pulls in..

Hello.
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

01:58.373 --> 02:00.680
Stop calling here.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.980
Damn, crank caller.

02:02.046 --> 02:04.013
Man, this is been
goin' on all week.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.813
It's startin'
to get on my nerves.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.246
‐ So, what is he sayin'?
‐ Nothin'.

02:08.312 --> 02:10.513
It's just this
annoying little laugh.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.313
[imitating caller's laugh]

02:13.680 --> 02:16.346
You know what? Maybe the phone
cord's tickling him.

02:16.413 --> 02:18.346
Happens to me
all the time.

02:19.213 --> 02:21.746
[telephone ringing]

02:21.813 --> 02:24.546
What you ladies need
is a man to answer the phone.

02:24.613 --> 02:25.746
[telephone ringing]

02:25.813 --> 02:27.146
Allow me.

02:27.213 --> 02:30.813
Crank callers are often
intimidated by the male voice.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.980
Listen up, you low life.
Stop calling here and harassing

02:36.046 --> 02:37.980
decent citizens
and you get‐‐

02:38.946 --> 02:40.613
Fine!

02:42.580 --> 02:46.446
Regine.
O‐oh, your mother can curse.

02:50.246 --> 02:54.180
Hey, Max. So, how did it go with
the coupons at the court house?

02:54.246 --> 02:56.980
Well, I got a citation
for littering and, uh..

02:57.046 --> 02:58.980
I was hit on by a flasher.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.920
Now, that's a step up for you.

03:03.220 --> 03:05.320
It's a step up from you.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.353
Don't worry, Max, everything's
gonna work out just fine.

03:16.953 --> 03:19.020
[loudly]
Haven't you been listening?

03:20.153 --> 03:22.886
I went down to
the court house with coupons

03:22.953 --> 03:25.920
and still
came up with nothin'!

03:28.286 --> 03:30.220
I heard you!

03:32.586 --> 03:34.986
I was just tryin'
to be encouraging and friendly

03:35.053 --> 03:37.020
but if want this
straight, don't miss missy

03:37.086 --> 03:39.120
you're in deep yogurt.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.153
I didn't wanna go there, man.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.253
Look, Max, you've been trying
for months to get legal work.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.286
Now, right now,
you just need a job.

03:55.353 --> 03:58.086
I know. You think I like
waking up in the morning

03:58.153 --> 03:59.653
and hanging around here all day?

03:59.720 --> 04:01.793
You mean you hate it, too?

04:03.360 --> 04:06.093
My problem is the only thing
that I'm trained to do..

04:06.160 --> 04:07.360
...is to be a lawyer.

04:07.426 --> 04:09.193
Now, come on, look at the ads.

04:09.260 --> 04:12.093
"Book keeper. Basic accountin'.
Secretary shorthand

04:12.160 --> 04:14.326

04:14.393 --> 04:18.793
Synclaire is more qualified
to get a job than I am.

04:18.860 --> 04:20.392
No, she's not.

04:21.459 --> 04:24.093
Well, my uncle used to say.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.026
If you want to stay employed..

04:26.093 --> 04:29.460
...you go in to a line of work
where people always need ya.

04:29.526 --> 04:32.993
That's why he's known as the
Porta Potty King of Cleveland.

04:34.993 --> 04:38.159

it's interesting.

04:50.893 --> 04:53.793
A $1000? Hmm

04:53.860 --> 04:57.193
That's four silk shirts,
two pairs of crepe pants

05:28.166 --> 05:30.566
Maxine Shaw, I'm here
for the telemarketing job.

05:31.733 --> 05:34.166
It's yours, congratulations.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.066
That's it? No interview?

05:37.133 --> 05:39.066
Lemme explain
something to you.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.500
This is not
a highly skilled job.

05:41.566 --> 05:44.566
Uh...neurosurgery.
That's a highly skilled job.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.533
This, uh, not so much.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
Oh, okay I don't have to do
any heavy breathing, do I?

05:50.666 --> 05:54.133
Of course, not.
That's disgusting.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.700
Uh, but of course,
if you find it to be

05:56.766 --> 05:59.706
a highly effective selling
technique, then run with it.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.606
Okay. What we sell here are

06:04.673 --> 06:07.706
subliminal self
improvement tapes.

06:10.173 --> 06:12.640
Each one with
a motivational message

06:12.706 --> 06:14.940
that's recorded
at such a low volume

06:15.006 --> 06:19.640
that only your subconscious
and cocker spaniels can hear it.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.173
[waves crashing]

06:24.906 --> 06:27.340
Sounds like waves crashing.

06:27.406 --> 06:30.606
Ah, but your
subconscious is hearing

06:30.673 --> 06:33.173
"You're fat. Put that back."

06:36.306 --> 06:38.773
And people really
buy these things, huh?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.306
Huh?

06:41.706 --> 06:43.673
Okay, well,
is there a health plan?

06:43.740 --> 06:47.606
Of course, if you get sick,
we give you a tape that says

06:47.673 --> 06:49.106
"You're not sick."

06:53.806 --> 06:56.173
A little subliminal tape humor.

06:57.273 --> 06:59.506

and here's your list of names.

"Have you ever
said to yourself, gee, I'm fat?

"Or Mrs. Mangini. Do you say,
gosh, I can't stop having sex

07:28.980 --> 07:31.380
and it's ruining my life?"

It happens.

"Well, I.."

Hello?

07:36.946 --> 07:38.146
Hello.

07:39.146 --> 07:41.113
Mrs. Mangini hung up.

07:41.180 --> 07:44.546
Don't worry about it.
I always use one of my ex‐wives

07:44.613 --> 07:46.713
for the first test call.

07:47.613 --> 07:50.080
Dial yourself silly.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.080
Right.

07:56.913 --> 08:01.153
Yes. Yes, hello, Mr. Montonio.
I'm calling..

Larry, Mr. Montonio
only speaks Spanish.

08:08.086 --> 08:12.753
No problemo, flippo el scripto.

08:18.253 --> 08:19.686
What is all this?

08:19.753 --> 08:21.886
Aye, I'm using
modern technology

08:21.953 --> 08:23.953
to track down your crank caller.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.286
We got the reel‐to‐reel.

08:25.353 --> 08:27.686
We got a voice stress analyzer.

08:27.753 --> 08:30.186
And your standard
ol' spectrograph.

08:30.253 --> 08:31.986
That'll come in handy
when you're ready

08:32.053 --> 08:34.086
to build your
time travelling DeLorean.

08:35.586 --> 08:38.553
No, you need
a flux capacitor for that.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.453
Anyway, by analyzing
the background noise

08:43.520 --> 08:45.253
of several
of the crank calls

08:45.320 --> 08:48.920
I can hear, people swearin'
and cars honking.

08:48.986 --> 08:52.653
So, I've narrowed it down
to New York City.

08:54.253 --> 08:56.953
And I thought those ears
were just for nibbling.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.353
Hmm, go on, get it.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.960
On the suck scale,
it sucks, plus two.

09:13.493 --> 09:14.460
Ow!

09:14.526 --> 09:16.860
Your night with Kyle
only sucked, plus one.

09:16.926 --> 09:19.226
Khadijah, you'd be amazed

09:19.293 --> 09:21.793
who you find here
at the bottom of the barrel.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.693
There's an accountant,
a disc jockey

09:23.760 --> 09:27.160
an airline pilot.
Hey, doc. Gimme a cigarette.

09:28.593 --> 09:30.826
Max, that job hasn't
got you smokin', has it?

09:30.893 --> 09:33.693
Oh, no, no. I'm just
holding it for effect, you know.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.693
It completes
the pathetic image.

09:38.726 --> 09:40.460
Larry, what are you doing?

09:40.526 --> 09:44.026
Oh, don't mind me.
Just a little spring cleaning.

09:47.660 --> 09:51.793
Anyway, you wouldn't believe
the office politics here.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.526
Like this girl, Deloris.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.460
Oh, she's been bucking
for the phone near the window.

09:57.526 --> 09:59.860
Alright, everyone, put down your
phones, you're under arrest.

09:59.926 --> 10:01.533
(Khadijah)
'Hey, what's goin' on?'

10:01.600 --> 10:03.366
I think I'm about
to be handcuffed.

10:03.433 --> 10:05.666
And I don't mean that
in a good way.

10:07.066 --> 10:09.900
Alright, you know,
peace and love. Peace and love.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.400
Peace and love.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.660
Hey, hey. Has Khadijah got back
from bailin' out Max yet?

10:20.727 --> 10:23.293
‐ Not yet.
‐ Oh, man, you know.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.860
I really wish
I had a copy of Jailhouse Rock.

10:25.927 --> 10:28.160
I want to blast it
when they drive up.

10:29.960 --> 10:33.260
‐ You get that crank caller yet?
‐ No, but I'm zeroin' in.

10:33.327 --> 10:35.760
While analyzing the tape,
I distinctly heard

10:35.827 --> 10:39.060
echoin' footsteps
and a splash of runnin' water.

10:39.127 --> 10:41.527
So my guess is,
the culprit is either callin'

10:41.593 --> 10:44.260
from the grand lobby
at the Waldorf Astoria

10:44.327 --> 10:47.693
or is a guy in flamenco boots
carryin' a bucket of water.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.293
Man..

10:52.660 --> 10:55.293
‐ Maxie, you're okay?
‐ Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.327
And, Khadijah, thanks again
for bailing me out.

10:57.393 --> 10:58.693
Oh, no problem.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.767
Kyle said he'd reimburse me,
if I gave him the canceled check

11:01.833 --> 11:03.767
with Max's bail written on it.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.967
[laughing]

11:08.700 --> 11:11.833
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up,
laugh it up, Kyle.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.400
I wrote your name and number
on the holding cell wall.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.833
Weren't you busy pumping iron
and watching game shows?

11:22.367 --> 11:23.300
Aw‐w.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.000
Show her some sympathy.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.567
Bad enough she doesn't
have a man or a job.

11:28.633 --> 11:31.800
Now, she's got this bad rap.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.867
Well, Max, after being in jail,
I bet you'd never wanna spend

11:34.933 --> 11:37.933
another moment cooped up
in a room with a bunch of women.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.933
Enjoy your freedom.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.433
Well, I'm not free.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.067
I've been given a date
to show up in court.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.567
But you did nothing wrong.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.333
I know, but
Galaxy Telemarketing did.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.767
They were taking money
for subliminal tapes

11:50.833 --> 11:53.333
with no
subliminal messages on them.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.467
My life is in the gutter.

11:58.267 --> 12:01.240
Your life is gonna be fine,
'cause you're not guilty.

12:01.307 --> 12:04.707
Being innocent does not
guarantee a quiddle.

12:04.773 --> 12:06.873
I could be disbarred.

12:06.940 --> 12:09.373
I could end up in prison.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.773
Oh, man, I'm sorry you're
going through all this, Max.

12:16.973 --> 12:19.140
Kyle is pitying me.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.273
I have truly reached
the lowest point in my life.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.807
Oh, don't despair, Max.
Hell is like Batman.

12:29.107 --> 12:31.340
Here comes another
philosophical Jim.

12:31.407 --> 12:35.173
Batman doesn't sit around
complaining about how diabolical

12:35.240 --> 12:38.707
the Joker is or how
distracting Catwoman is in her..

12:38.773 --> 12:42.473
...skin tight,
pad leather unitard.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.740
No! No!

12:43.807 --> 12:46.140
He...he gets off his back behind

12:46.207 --> 12:48.673
and kick some
arch villain booty.

12:50.573 --> 12:55.173
I have hit rock bottom because
that make complete sense to me.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.007
Overton's right.

13:00.073 --> 13:02.013
I am not going out like that.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.480
I am not going out
without a fight.

13:07.147 --> 13:10.480
Wow, Overton, your bad speech
really fired her up.

13:10.547 --> 13:14.780
We can learn a lot from our
little animated friends.

13:14.847 --> 13:16.780
'Like, when I was a kid..'

13:17.880 --> 13:19.480
...I used to like Fat Albert.

13:19.547 --> 13:22.613
And then I thought, well,
hey, who's gonna get more women?

13:22.680 --> 13:25.013
A superhero with a sweet ride

13:25.080 --> 13:27.780
or a 200 pound
seventh grader?

13:36.513 --> 13:37.947
Oh, Max.

13:38.013 --> 13:41.413
Look, I talked to Synclaire, she
doesn't know where Overton is.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.213
Damn! What about you?
Did you bring what I asked for?

13:44.280 --> 13:45.480
Yeah.

13:45.547 --> 13:47.847
There's a little stick
in there you can, uh..

13:47.913 --> 13:50.313
...spread the cheese
over the cracker with it.

13:55.247 --> 13:57.547
Excuse me,
are you Fred Mayer?

13:57.613 --> 13:59.847
And you're asking
me that because..

13:59.913 --> 14:03.887
‐ You're my public defender.
‐ Ah, it's great, I found you.

14:03.953 --> 14:06.320
Look, I just suggest
you plead guilty

14:06.387 --> 14:08.353
pay the fine,
just get it over with.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.620
‐ What's your name?
‐ Maxine Shaw.

14:11.687 --> 14:14.187
‐ Oh, you're the lawyer.
‐ Exactly.

14:14.253 --> 14:17.853
Have some idea how to get me off
'cause I'm not pleading guilty.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.153
Right, you better not mess up
'cause we pay your salary.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.487
Oh, great.
Disgruntled tax payers.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.587
Widows or no widows.
Guilty.

14:27.653 --> 14:29.087
Next case.

14:33.687 --> 14:35.820
Case number 496.

14:35.887 --> 14:38.020
The people versus
Galaxy Telemarketing.

14:38.087 --> 14:40.020
Maxine Shaw, first defendant.

14:41.787 --> 14:44.453
Galaxy Telemarketing!

14:44.520 --> 14:48.520
Larry Friedlander,
what are we selling this week?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.053
Hello, Your Honor.

14:51.120 --> 14:56.253
Have I ever told you how
lovely you look in that robe?

14:56.320 --> 14:58.387
Settle down, Larry.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.493
Your Honor, my client pleads..

15:05.327 --> 15:06.593
...not guilty.

15:07.393 --> 15:08.760
Not guilty

15:09.993 --> 15:12.060
Any particular reason?

15:12.127 --> 15:14.793
Yes. For the two hours
Michelle worked

15:14.860 --> 15:17.960
as a telemarketer
she made not one sale.

15:18.027 --> 15:21.060
She made no sale,
she committed no crime.

15:21.127 --> 15:23.627
It's as simple as that.

15:27.993 --> 15:31.127
You were just handed this case
out in the hallway, weren't you?

15:33.127 --> 15:35.527
I am going to fry.

15:36.993 --> 15:38.927
Okay, how about this?

15:41.460 --> 15:43.827
In State of California
versus Patty Hearst

15:43.893 --> 15:47.960
the defense argued that a person
cannot be held responsible when

15:48.027 --> 15:52.027
their mind is being controlled
by some outside force.

15:52.093 --> 15:55.093
Your Honor, I contend
that Miss Maxine Shaw

15:55.160 --> 15:57.727
was under the influence

15:57.793 --> 16:01.467
of this Svengali,
this mastermind control..

16:01.533 --> 16:02.967
...Larry Friedlander.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.833
Oh, stop.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.567
Brain washed, huh?
Okay, I'm ready to rule‐‐

16:12.633 --> 16:14.567
Your Honor, I'm an attorney.

16:14.633 --> 16:16.867
I'd like to go pro se
and represent myself.

16:16.933 --> 16:18.400
‐ No offense, Fred.
‐ None taken.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.933
My next move
is gonna be the insanity plea.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.667
I'll save that for Larry.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.800
Miss Shaw, if you think you can
top the Patty Hearst thing..

16:27.867 --> 16:29.467
Your Honor.

16:29.533 --> 16:32.567
The police records indicate
that only one person

16:32.633 --> 16:35.800
led the offices
of Galaxy Telemarketing.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.200
Why?

16:37.267 --> 16:40.367
Because only one man knew
what he was doing was illegal.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.933
That man,
Lawrence J Friedlander.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.033
You'll never work in the
telemarketing industry again.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.567
I made you and I can break you.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.640
‐ Sit.
‐ Sorry.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.873
Now, had I known..

17:02.940 --> 17:06.373
...had any of us known that what
we were involved in was illegal

17:06.440 --> 17:08.406
wouldn't one of us
run from the police?

17:08.473 --> 17:10.473
But we didn't run.
Not one of us.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.272
Because we had
no knowledge and therefore

17:12.339 --> 17:14.440
no intent to commit fraud.

17:14.507 --> 17:16.440
Do you have any evidence?

17:22.307 --> 17:23.973
Not at this time, Your Honor.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.740
Your Honor, I've known this
woman since freshman year

17:26.807 --> 17:28.573
in college and she's
always been honest.

17:28.640 --> 17:33.173
If there was some law against
being honest she'd be arrested.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.973
But then it'd be a crime,
so she wouldn't do it.

17:43.173 --> 17:45.940
You know what I'm sayin'.

17:46.007 --> 17:48.773
Hold that gavel.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.207
Another friend of the defendant?

17:52.840 --> 17:56.107
‐ Did you get the tape?
‐ And this along with the tape.

17:57.873 --> 18:00.147
Your Honor, I call
Overton Wakefield Jones

18:00.213 --> 18:01.647
to the stand.

18:06.947 --> 18:08.947
Now, Mr. Jones..

18:09.013 --> 18:11.047
...you have been
recording all phone calls

18:11.113 --> 18:13.913
coming into
Miss James apartment.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.447
Is that correct?

18:16.947 --> 18:19.180
Is that correct?

18:19.247 --> 18:21.447
Yes, yes,
at the ladies request I was

18:21.513 --> 18:24.280
tryin' to track down a crank
caller. Don't you see?

18:28.313 --> 18:32.280
Mr. Jones, please tell the court
what is on this tape.

18:32.347 --> 18:35.147
It's a conversation
between you and Khadijah

18:35.213 --> 18:37.480
at the precise moment
the police came in.

18:38.813 --> 18:43.180
Further long on the tape
is the best of Boosie Collins..

18:43.247 --> 18:45.780
...I don't see how
that figures into this case.

18:45.847 --> 18:50.613
‐ Uh, Boosie a bass player.
‐ P‐Funk, yeah.

18:57.580 --> 19:00.720
Your Honor, this recording
will prove that I had absolutely

19:00.787 --> 19:02.387
no knowledge those tapes
were fraudulent.

19:02.453 --> 19:05.420
In fact, I was having
a personal conversation

19:05.487 --> 19:07.620
and therefore was
not engaged in phone fraud

19:07.687 --> 19:10.820
when the police arrived.
I was not seen doing it.

19:10.887 --> 19:12.520
I was not heard doing it.

19:12.587 --> 19:15.520
And this is all to say
very simply, Your Honor.

19:16.987 --> 19:18.887
I didn't do it.

19:18.953 --> 19:21.820
That's a very
compelling argument, Miss Shaw.

19:21.887 --> 19:24.987
Pending my verification
of the tapes authenticity..

19:25.053 --> 19:26.687
...you're case is dismissed.

19:26.753 --> 19:29.453
Yes. Oh, you did it, baby.

19:30.487 --> 19:32.787
Max, I'm Deloris.

19:32.853 --> 19:35.687
Right, you were selling that
impotence could be sexy tape.

19:35.753 --> 19:38.520
Will you represent me?

19:38.587 --> 19:40.353
If that's alright
with you, Your Honor?

19:40.420 --> 19:43.687
Would anybody else like to be
represented my Miss Shaw?

19:50.820 --> 19:53.220
Put your hand down, Larry.

19:56.287 --> 20:00.160
Oh, check me out,
people, I'm free.

20:00.227 --> 20:02.527
Well, you get what you pay for.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.260
My girl worked
it in court today.

20:05.327 --> 20:07.793
Not only did she clear
herself off the charges..

20:07.860 --> 20:10.027
...but she cleared
everybody else

20:10.093 --> 20:12.460
and got her a date
with that cute bailiff.

20:13.993 --> 20:16.960
Yes, being back in court
gave me such a rush.

20:17.027 --> 20:20.260
After gettin' a glimpse into
the workings of our legal system

20:20.327 --> 20:23.327
I realized that Matlock pretty
much tells it the way it is.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.293
[telephone ringing]

20:26.360 --> 20:29.293
Nobody get that,
that's that crank caller.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.560
Could be for me. Put your number
on my answering machine.

20:35.193 --> 20:37.027
Hello.

20:37.093 --> 20:38.727
Oh, how are you?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.193
Is that right?

20:41.927 --> 20:43.860
Is that right?

20:44.893 --> 20:46.993
Is that right?

20:47.060 --> 20:50.693
‐ Is that right?
‐ Hell, I guess that's right.

20:52.193 --> 20:53.560
Well, alright.

20:54.893 --> 20:56.193
It's the
public defenders office.

20:56.260 --> 21:00.067
Judge Glazer was so impressed
with me that she put in a word.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.067
‐ What?
‐ Low pay, long hours?

21:02.133 --> 21:04.333
I'll take it.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.200
See you Monday.

21:06.267 --> 21:07.233
I got a job.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.633
‐ Yes.
‐ Yeah, ha, ha, yeah.

21:17.233 --> 21:19.800
Max, you're gonna
be a public defender.

21:19.867 --> 21:22.033
You're gonna work
for the people.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.200
‐ Freak the people, I got a job.
‐ Yeah.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.867
Hey, this caller ID phone
Overton installed really works.

21:32.933 --> 21:35.000
We got
the crank caller's number.

21:35.067 --> 21:38.567
Oh, shoot. He's gonna be sorry
he ever called this house.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.900
Listen up, you punk,
if you think for a min‐‐

21:45.967 --> 21:47.067
What?

21:48.000 --> 21:48.933
Oh!

21:49.833 --> 21:51.800
What's your name, little boy?

21:52.933 --> 21:54.267
Andy.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.467
Have you been callin' here?

21:56.533 --> 21:58.767
Well, you know, Andy,
what you doin' is wrong.

21:58.833 --> 22:01.773
I could call the police.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.340
What you mean
the police work for your dad?

22:05.407 --> 22:08.373
Look, stop
making up stories, young man

22:08.440 --> 22:10.540
and don't call here
anymore, okay?

22:13.007 --> 22:16.690
Crazy kid.
Says his father's the mayor.

22:20.156 --> 22:22.190
[laughing]
