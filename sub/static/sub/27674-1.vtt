00:00.770 --> 00:02.570
- [Emma] Am I allowed one drumstick?

00:03.701 --> 00:04.691
- [Jessica] There's only one.

00:04.691 --> 00:05.524
- There's only one?
- Yeah.

00:05.524 --> 00:06.357
- Are you serious?

00:06.357 --> 00:07.190
- Yep.

00:08.029 --> 00:10.120
(knocking)

00:10.120 --> 00:11.593
- Oh my God, Jess, Jess!

00:12.460 --> 00:14.598
That's the hunters.

00:14.598 --> 00:15.639
Jess, go!

00:15.639 --> 00:17.410
- Out the back, out
the back, out the back!

00:17.410 --> 00:18.719
Stop!

00:18.719 --> 00:20.610
(dramatic music)

00:20.610 --> 00:23.333
- [Narrator] Ten ordinary
people from across the U.K.

00:24.210 --> 00:29.140
have surrendered their
identities to become fugitives.

00:29.140 --> 00:31.559
- Already, it sends
shivers through my spine.

00:31.559 --> 00:32.670
(metal detector beeping)

00:32.670 --> 00:34.860
- The adrenaline rush is
something that hopefully,

00:34.860 --> 00:36.490
we'll never face in real life.

00:36.490 --> 00:38.119
(both laughing)

00:38.119 --> 00:39.930
(helicopter whirring)

00:39.930 --> 00:41.180
- [Narrator] They are being tracked down

00:41.180 --> 00:43.930
by an elite team of
former police, military,

00:43.930 --> 00:46.140
and intelligence personnel.

00:46.140 --> 00:51.109
- Hack, bug, search, we
go through everything.

00:51.109 --> 00:52.170
- Where's your phone at, Mike?

00:52.170 --> 00:54.830
'Cause that phone tells
us everywhere you've gone.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.740
- [Narrator] Armed with
the powers of the state.

00:56.740 --> 00:57.603
- Go, go, go!

00:58.840 --> 01:00.040
- [Narrator] In one of the most watched

01:00.040 --> 01:01.423
countries in the world.

01:03.890 --> 01:05.620
- Shit me, that was nerveracking.

01:05.620 --> 01:06.800
It's like one massive
game of hide and seek

01:06.800 --> 01:09.332
and that was always my
favorite game as a child.

01:09.332 --> 01:10.273
- Stop!

01:11.151 --> 01:11.984
- Come on!

01:13.498 --> 01:14.423
- That's him, that's him!

01:15.550 --> 01:18.252
- [Narrator] If they can
evade capture for 25 days,

01:18.252 --> 01:19.419
(knocking on the door)

01:19.419 --> 01:20.532
- [Woman] Here come the hunters.

01:20.532 --> 01:21.560
- Come on!

01:21.560 --> 01:24.738
- [Narrator] They will
win a share of Â£100,000.

01:24.738 --> 01:26.320
- That money would look
great in my bank account,

01:26.320 --> 01:27.300
all them zeros.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.110
(shouting excitedly)

01:30.110 --> 01:31.791
- [Narrator] Where will they hide?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.420
- They are there somewhere.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.860
- [Narrator] Who can they trust?

01:34.860 --> 01:36.060
- [Woman] They're onto you.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.630
- We have to get out of here now.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.060
- [Narrator] How will they survive?

01:39.060 --> 01:41.561
- I'm just lost and lonely.

01:41.561 --> 01:42.640
- Stop!

01:42.640 --> 01:43.990
- [Narrator] What would you do?

01:43.990 --> 01:44.823
- Go on, boys.

01:44.823 --> 01:47.020
- That's it, that's it!
- Stay where you are!

01:48.140 --> 01:50.307
- He's in there somewhere.

01:54.209 --> 01:55.569
Come here, mate, stop!

01:55.569 --> 01:59.495
(electricity buzzing)

01:59.495 --> 02:02.662
(slow dramatic music)

02:11.916 --> 02:14.083
(beeping)

02:16.327 --> 02:19.577
(boat engine whirring)

02:20.794 --> 02:23.794
(suspenseful music)

02:30.530 --> 02:33.950
- Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

02:33.950 --> 02:36.670
Ten fugitives are on the run,

02:36.670 --> 02:39.870
they are traveling together in a speedboat

02:39.870 --> 02:42.512
towards the northwest coast of England.

02:42.512 --> 02:44.952
I have their names and mugshots here.

02:44.952 --> 02:46.900
(suspenseful music)

02:46.900 --> 02:49.320
- [Narrator] Leading the
hunters is Peter Bleksley,

02:49.320 --> 02:52.010
an ex-Met detective,
responsible for catching

02:52.010 --> 02:55.550
some of the U.K's most
dangerous criminals.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.850
- Julie, can you get me
live updates on any tracker

02:58.850 --> 03:00.370
that may have on board?

03:00.370 --> 03:01.203
- Yep.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.410
- [Narrator] Teams of elite
ground hunters have been

03:05.410 --> 03:09.303
tactically placed across the
U.K, awaiting deployment.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.450
- Guys, we have ten fugitives,

03:13.450 --> 03:16.167
they're currently in a
speedboat on the River Mersey,

03:16.167 --> 03:18.093
headed towards Liverpool.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.290
Cashmore's in the air, at the moment,

03:20.290 --> 03:22.390
in the northwest region.

03:22.390 --> 03:25.610
Nic and Claire, you're the
closest ground hunter team,

03:25.610 --> 03:28.318
can you start heading towards
that location now, please?

03:28.318 --> 03:29.260
(car engine revving)

03:29.260 --> 03:32.013
- Our ETA is half an hour from here.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.810
(helicopter whirring)

03:36.810 --> 03:37.720
- All right, here we go.

03:37.720 --> 03:40.400
Nicholas Batchelor, 51, from Kent,

03:40.400 --> 03:44.023
with Paul James, 48 year old,
from the Hertfordshire area.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.810
- I'm all about the buzz, legally.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.730
- Just take that out.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.407
- I'm not going on it
just for taking part,

03:52.407 --> 03:54.370
it's not about that.
- Gonna win it, ain't we?

03:54.370 --> 03:56.000
- 100%.
- Yeah.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.870
- We've got Emma Davidson,
who's 23 from Devon,

03:58.870 --> 04:03.060
with Jessica Kirkham, 27, from Devon.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.530
- We're nurses, we're very
caring, very nurturing.

04:05.530 --> 04:07.820
- But we wanna prove that
sweet, innocent nurses

04:07.820 --> 04:09.130
can be bad-asses.

04:09.130 --> 04:11.979
So we've got to outwit and outplay them.

04:11.979 --> 04:12.812
(helicopter whirring)

04:12.812 --> 04:15.070
- Seems we're over the River Mersey now.

04:15.070 --> 04:16.840
No sighting as yet.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.346
- Paul, we need eyes on them,

04:18.346 --> 04:23.258
before they bail out this
vessel, that's imperative.

04:23.258 --> 04:25.456
- Stand by, stand by, chief.

04:25.456 --> 04:27.226
Eyes on, eyes on.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.059
- [Peter] Stand by.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.430
- What's that?
- Here we go, here we go.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.756
- [Paul] Confirmed two drivers

04:30.756 --> 04:33.077
and ten fugitives on the boat.

04:33.077 --> 04:36.244
(helicopter whirring)

04:37.557 --> 04:40.290
- [Julie] We've got Harry
Savage, 20 year old, from Essex,

04:40.290 --> 04:43.413
with Frank Savage, 23 year
old, from East Sussex.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.780
- You're being watched
every minute, basically.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.430
And trying to hide from
that is going to be hard,

04:50.430 --> 04:51.866
massively hard.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.340
But the Savages never give up,

04:53.340 --> 04:55.650
that's a family trait of ours.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.540
- [Julie] Single fugitive, Matthew Mason,

04:58.540 --> 05:01.170
29, from the Devon area.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.400
- During my time in the Royal Marines,

05:02.400 --> 05:05.370
I've conducted three tours of Afghanistan.

05:05.370 --> 05:09.523
Being able to excel,
survive, is second nature.

05:13.115 --> 05:16.453
- Yeah, to left, left, looks
like they're coming in to dock.

05:16.453 --> 05:18.530
- It's coming into Canning Dock.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.160
- Canning Dock.
- Canning Dock.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.783
- All right, right in the center.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.710
(boat engine whirring)

05:26.710 --> 05:28.960
(suspenseful music)

05:28.960 --> 05:30.770
- I want all the exit routes covered,

05:30.770 --> 05:34.422
I want CCTV blanket across that city.

05:34.422 --> 05:35.612
- Yes, chief.

05:35.612 --> 05:38.600
(boat engine whirring)

05:38.600 --> 05:40.060
- We've got all the train stations,

05:40.060 --> 05:42.580
and the coach station, all
monitored at the moment,

05:42.580 --> 05:44.030
and taxi ranks.
- Okay.

05:44.030 --> 05:47.200
(helicopter whirring)

05:47.200 --> 05:48.210
- [Peter] Stand by.

05:48.210 --> 05:49.223
- Yeah, so locks on.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.820
- With so many places they could disappear

05:54.820 --> 05:56.190
in Liverpool City Center.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.428
We're gonna have to operate
a bird in the hand theory.

05:58.428 --> 05:59.261
- Yeah.

05:59.261 --> 06:00.730
- The one that we think
we can follow best,

06:00.730 --> 06:02.281
that will be the one we focus on.

06:02.281 --> 06:03.114
- [Man] Okay.

06:03.114 --> 06:05.133
(helicopter whirring)

06:05.133 --> 06:07.610
- All right, chief, it looks
like they're gonna pay load,

06:07.610 --> 06:09.262
it's coming to a standstill, stand by.

06:09.262 --> 06:12.702
(suspenseful music)

06:12.702 --> 06:15.550
(helicopter whirring)

06:15.550 --> 06:17.550
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

06:18.429 --> 06:19.930
- [Narrator] For the next 25 days,

06:19.930 --> 06:21.910
the fugitives must stay on the move.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.280
- [Man] Go, go, go, go, go!

06:23.280 --> 06:25.590
- [Narrator] Attempt to throw
the hunters off their scent,

06:25.590 --> 06:28.041
and seek help from friends and family.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.401
- [Woman] Let's go.

06:29.401 --> 06:30.234
- [Man] All right, cross.

06:30.234 --> 06:31.269
(shouting)

06:31.269 --> 06:34.019
(dramatic music)

06:38.080 --> 06:40.253
- Go for yellow cagoule, left, left.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.570
Yeah, stay with her.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.490
- [Woman] That's the single
female, Loren Hannon,

06:44.490 --> 06:46.470
26 year old from Essex.

06:46.470 --> 06:47.370
- [Woman #2] She still lives at home.

06:47.370 --> 06:50.730
And she worked in the Royal
British Legion in the Bath.

06:50.730 --> 06:52.380
- It's gonna be a massive
shock to my system,

06:52.380 --> 06:53.213
going on the run.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.003
The whole of my life, I've
kind of been sheltered.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.750
I spend a lot of time
indoors, looking after my mum.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.902
My world is a small world (laughs).

07:01.902 --> 07:03.841
(helicopter whirring)

07:03.841 --> 07:04.674
Ah, shit!

07:08.206 --> 07:09.630
- What did she just ditch?

07:09.630 --> 07:13.019
Zoom in on her please, can
we get a tight shot of her?

07:13.019 --> 07:15.400
This is excellent, chief,
she's dropping all her kit,

07:15.400 --> 07:17.293
she's buying us time.

07:18.340 --> 07:21.080
- She's panicking, she's
wearing a bright yellow top,

07:21.080 --> 07:24.009
she's not thought this
through, she's so conspicuous.

07:24.009 --> 07:25.800
- ETA of ground hunter teams, Ben?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.241
- Three minutes to that
last location, boss.

07:28.241 --> 07:30.770
- ETA three minutes, Paul.

07:30.770 --> 07:32.011
- Come on!

07:32.011 --> 07:34.091
(helicopter whirring)

07:34.091 --> 07:35.880
(car engine revving)

07:35.880 --> 07:37.330
- What color hair?
- Blonde.

07:38.990 --> 07:43.048
She's going, she's getting
popped off, day one, bosh.

07:43.048 --> 07:45.370
(breathing heavily)

07:45.370 --> 07:47.770
- All my shit fell out
and I had to do it all up.

07:47.770 --> 07:49.760
I'm sitting there and I'm like
"Can someone just help me?"

07:49.760 --> 07:51.523
And they just walked past me.

07:52.630 --> 07:54.730
It's gonna be stressful,
it's gonna be hard.

07:54.730 --> 07:56.830
Part of it's gonna be winging it.

07:56.830 --> 07:58.400
I'm dying already!

07:58.400 --> 08:00.530
And so just be as nice as I normally am,

08:00.530 --> 08:03.507
as polite as I can be, and
hopefully people will see that,

08:03.507 --> 08:05.110
and they'll wanna help me.

08:05.110 --> 08:05.943
(group muttering)

08:05.943 --> 08:08.458
- [Julie] ATM, she's
gonna cash withdrawal.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.291
- Shit.

08:10.363 --> 08:12.363
100%, that helicopter can see me.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.910
- Okay, she's going off,
it's gonna be slight loss,

08:17.910 --> 08:20.570
can we get the helicopter
round the Travelodge?

08:20.570 --> 08:21.830
- [Woman] Head round the corner.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.190
She's gone off to the left, then under,

08:23.190 --> 08:24.540
she's under building cover.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.569
- I need to get changed,
'cause this is very bright.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.840
(helicopter whirring)

08:32.840 --> 08:34.410
- Chief I'm pretty certain,
there's someone hiding

08:34.410 --> 08:35.360
behind that pillar.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.101
- Now I need to fit this in, shit.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.470
- Okay, Travelodge in
sight, Travelodge in sight.

08:42.470 --> 08:43.453
- [Claire] Come on!

08:44.870 --> 08:46.679
- [Ben] This guy just walked
out to check what's going on.

08:46.679 --> 08:47.713
- [Man] What is he looking at?

08:47.713 --> 08:49.740
- You can see feet
moving right there look,

08:49.740 --> 08:50.580
she's right there.

08:50.580 --> 08:52.710
- Yeah, yeah, I think
she's still under there.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.320
- I didn't think this through.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.300
Shit, shit, shit.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.579
Fuck it, it can stay
there, I don't need it.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.710
(suspenseful music)

08:59.710 --> 09:02.070
- Right, we're at the
Travelodge on foot, boss.

09:02.070 --> 09:02.931
- What's going on?

09:02.931 --> 09:04.720
Claire, Claire?

09:04.720 --> 09:05.553
- Yellow?

09:06.553 --> 09:09.000
Jacket?
- Oh yeah, good spot.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.620
- [Man On Phone] She went
under that little canopy,

09:11.620 --> 09:13.423
we can see a yellow jacket.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.540
- Yeah, it's here.

09:18.150 --> 09:19.823
- [Peter] Where could she have gone?

09:22.190 --> 09:25.070
- I might ask someone if
they'd give me a lift.

09:25.070 --> 09:25.903
Excuse me?

09:27.370 --> 09:28.930
This is really random
right, but I'm on the run

09:28.930 --> 09:31.078
and I need to just get out,
can I jump in with you,

09:31.078 --> 09:33.118
wherever you're going?

09:33.118 --> 09:34.747
No, okay, not to worry.

09:34.747 --> 09:37.290
(helicopter whirring)

09:37.290 --> 09:38.798
- [Woman] I'm just thinking, if I was her,

09:38.798 --> 09:40.473
I would go straight into a car.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.140
- Yeah, does that lead to a car park?

09:44.140 --> 09:46.980
Can you go to the car park
and cover that off please?

09:46.980 --> 09:49.420
She's got a vehicle sat
there, or she's hitched.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.057
It's perfect, we won't see her again.

09:52.057 --> 09:53.545
- Fucking hell!

09:53.545 --> 09:56.040
Where, where, where, where, where?

09:56.040 --> 09:57.046
Can I come with you?

09:57.046 --> 09:57.879
Oh!

09:57.879 --> 09:59.733
I'm gonna get in the back,
'cause of the windows.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.593
Right, shit.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.549
Right.

10:03.549 --> 10:04.382
(person in car speaks faintly)

10:04.382 --> 10:05.215
Anywhere.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.290
Oh my God, thank you so much!

10:10.416 --> 10:13.235
Ah, it worked (laughs)!

10:13.235 --> 10:15.016
You're a fucking legend!

10:15.016 --> 10:17.543
Oh my God, thank you so much.

10:19.686 --> 10:20.686
- Fuck sake.

10:22.146 --> 10:23.640
I can't see her anywhere, boss.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.473
She's gone.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.600
- [Woman] Where did she go from there?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.340
- Paul, you can pan away from there

10:30.340 --> 10:32.600
now we've got ground hunters.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.996
- Yes, yes, chief.

10:33.996 --> 10:36.818
(helicopter whirring)

10:36.818 --> 10:38.357
- Oh my God.

10:38.357 --> 10:39.440
Come on Jess!

10:41.080 --> 10:43.210
- [Narrator] Nine
fugitives are yet to escape

10:43.210 --> 10:44.978
from the City Center.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.811
(groaning)

10:45.811 --> 10:47.229
- Keep it moving, Harry!

10:47.229 --> 10:48.677
- [Harry] I'm running
out of breath, Frank.

10:48.677 --> 10:50.670
(helicopter whirring)

10:50.670 --> 10:52.830
- Where would you go from here?

10:53.778 --> 10:56.278
- [Nathanael] Excuse me, guys.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.970
- [Man] We've got some
CCTV footage come in.

10:59.970 --> 11:00.970
Backpacks.

11:00.970 --> 11:01.880
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.010
That's Nathanael, straight away,

11:04.010 --> 11:05.870
he's the one with the
distinctive hair, the K rows.

11:05.870 --> 11:09.560
Nathanael Watt, 26 year
old male from Nottingham,

11:09.560 --> 11:11.267
traveling with Ismail Haruna,

11:12.141 --> 11:14.480
a 27 year old male from Nottingham.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.390
- Find me two fugitives on roller blades.

11:17.390 --> 11:20.131
They should stick out like
a pair of sore thumbs.

11:20.131 --> 11:23.190
(intense music)

11:23.190 --> 11:25.830
- The hunters are going to
be doing everything they can

11:25.830 --> 11:27.303
to break us down mentally.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.250
- But we like a challenge.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.083
- Yeah.

11:31.083 --> 11:34.890
We are gonna be a force for
the hunters to deal with.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.390
Because the things that
we're planning to do

11:37.390 --> 11:39.280
haven't been done before.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.113
- Go!

11:40.113 --> 11:42.230
- [Narrator] All the fugitives
have been given the option

11:42.230 --> 11:45.810
to recruit an accomplice to
aid their initial escape.

11:45.810 --> 11:47.109
- [Man] How are you doing?

11:47.109 --> 11:49.700
- [Ismail] Not bad here
mate, you're a life saver.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.490
- Changing appearance.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.843
There's a very conscious
helicopter still above.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.477
Hopefully, they're tracking
some of the other fugitives,

11:57.477 --> 12:00.327
go for someone slightly more
vulnerable, slightly slower.

12:01.825 --> 12:03.247
(groaning)

12:03.247 --> 12:04.930
- Come on mate, come on!

12:04.930 --> 12:05.963
- Enough running mate.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.190
- Chief, I think we've got
two people with backpacks,

12:10.190 --> 12:12.660
males, under here, they were walking down,

12:12.660 --> 12:15.257
they've dived straight
under when they looked up.

12:15.257 --> 12:16.660
It's this building down here.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.400
- [Peter] Paul, you're
receiving the chase.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.910
- Go ahead chief, go ahead.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.880
- Pan the screen down.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.730
Apparently two people with backpacks

12:23.730 --> 12:26.070
were seen to enter that building.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.660
- Yes, that's all received.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.860
- Ready?

12:28.860 --> 12:31.449
Go, go, fucking go.
- No running, I'm not running.

12:31.449 --> 12:35.196
(helicopter whirring)

12:35.196 --> 12:38.630
- I've lived my life on the
edge for a number of years.

12:38.630 --> 12:41.798
Been on the run before
from the authorities.

12:41.798 --> 12:44.598
I wasn't a good criminal,
you know what I mean?

12:44.598 --> 12:46.233
I didn't know you were
supposed to get away with it,

12:46.233 --> 12:48.040
I got caught quite a lot,

12:48.040 --> 12:49.890
but when you're on first name terms

12:49.890 --> 12:54.100
with your local constable,
something ain't quite right.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.560
Underground.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.393
Underground.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.240
- Oh, three.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.750
My legs are gone, mate.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.667
- Just walk mate, walk, walk, walk.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.500
- I am.

13:04.768 --> 13:06.300
- I've never been caught by the police.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.320
When the pressure's on, it
can bring the best out of me.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.740
If I've got to sleep in a bin,

13:10.740 --> 13:12.430
so what, done it before.

13:12.430 --> 13:13.950
If I've got to sleep in the boot of a car,

13:13.950 --> 13:15.430
so what, done it before.

13:15.430 --> 13:18.580
Silver, it's here, it's here, it's here.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.750
There's nothing out
there which frightens me

13:20.750 --> 13:23.027
or deters me from our goal.

13:23.027 --> 13:23.860
Go, go, go.

13:23.860 --> 13:27.370
Beating the hunters, a nice
bit of money at the end.

13:28.638 --> 13:29.897
Get down boys, get down.

13:29.897 --> 13:32.897
(suspenseful music)

13:34.700 --> 13:36.635
Well done boys.

13:36.635 --> 13:37.468
- Yeah.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.329
I'll tell you what I was about waiting

13:38.329 --> 13:39.460
to score on that boat.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.289
Cricky hell mate.

13:41.289 --> 13:43.628
Jesus, one week in we're
gonna be on 24 hours on A&E.

13:43.628 --> 13:44.929
(all laughing)

13:44.929 --> 13:47.679
(dramatic music)

13:49.230 --> 13:51.890
- So Nic, potentially also Paul as well,

13:51.890 --> 13:53.728
something to do with drug support groups.

13:53.728 --> 13:54.561
- Okay.

13:54.561 --> 13:55.394
- It's coming up quite a lot.

13:55.394 --> 13:56.980
He's posted quite a few
motivational type pictures

13:56.980 --> 13:58.050
to his Facebook as well.

13:58.050 --> 14:00.003
Things about life being a struggle.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.630
- Nic Batchelor has a total
of 41 criminal convictions.

14:04.630 --> 14:06.020
- Any recent?

14:06.020 --> 14:07.330
- None since 2008.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.440
- Nic has got several convictions

14:11.440 --> 14:14.000
whereas Paul has
absolutely none on record.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.940
Of course that doesn't mean
he wasn't heavily embroiled

14:15.940 --> 14:17.380
in the criminal network,

14:17.380 --> 14:18.810
just means he might have been pretty good

14:18.810 --> 14:20.280
and not got caught.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.817
That might prove a problem for us.

14:22.817 --> 14:24.817
- [Woman] It's all ready, I've got CCTV.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.700
This was the private CCTV we asked for.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.720
That's Nicholas and Paul.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.922
They're getting into a Mercedes.

14:32.922 --> 14:34.446
- That car is waiting for them isn't it?

14:34.446 --> 14:36.780
- Yeah, he popped the boot
as they run towards him.

14:36.780 --> 14:37.770
- That's not hitchhiking,

14:37.770 --> 14:39.520
is that info checked on that vehicle?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.562
- [Woman] Yeah, this puts
us right behind them.

14:42.562 --> 14:43.850
(suspenseful music)

14:43.850 --> 14:45.250
- How are we gonna do this Paul?

14:45.250 --> 14:46.200
- Well we could do one at a time.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.625
All right come on Peter, go over.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.542
- I'll try.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.690
- [Narrator] Nicholas and Paul
have persuaded two friends

14:51.690 --> 14:56.174
to pose as decoys in an
attempt to deceive the hunters.

14:56.174 --> 14:57.343
- Fucking elbow.

14:58.673 --> 15:00.374
- All right, I'm gonna go sideways.

15:00.374 --> 15:01.993
Oh yeah, we're not gonna
make it easy for them.

15:03.623 --> 15:05.170
They're gonna be busy.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.450
- Don't forget, heads down all the time

15:06.450 --> 15:07.920
till you get where you're going.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.350
We know how to survive,
we've had to do it.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.461
Now, now, now.

15:11.461 --> 15:13.130
Get out, we're staying
down, shut the doors.

15:13.130 --> 15:17.054
We come from that background
where it was dog eat dog

15:17.054 --> 15:19.120
and we believe we've got the bigger teeth.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.086
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.836
(dramatic music)

15:25.359 --> 15:29.306
(electricity buzzing)

15:29.306 --> 15:31.804
(electricity buzzing)

15:31.804 --> 15:34.220
(helicopter whirring)

15:34.220 --> 15:35.280
- Jess the helicopter's right over head,

15:35.280 --> 15:36.295
it's about to see us.

15:36.295 --> 15:37.128
- Fuck.

15:37.128 --> 15:38.612
- [Narrator] 10 fugitives are on the run.

15:38.612 --> 15:39.460
- Let's go.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.033
- [Narrator] Hoping to
win a share of a Â£100,000.

15:42.980 --> 15:45.760
So far they've all made
a successful getaway

15:45.760 --> 15:47.132
from Liverpool City Center.

15:47.132 --> 15:50.132
(suspenseful music)

15:51.684 --> 15:53.010
- You'll like this one boss.

15:53.010 --> 15:55.680
Matthew is a Royal Marine we believe.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.710
- [Peter] Currently serving?

15:56.710 --> 15:58.070
- We think so, yes.

15:58.070 --> 16:01.380
Very, very, fit he holds
the world record for rowing

16:01.380 --> 16:03.300
from Grand Canaria to Barbados

16:03.300 --> 16:06.170
and he cycled from Land's End
to John o' Groats in 7 days.

16:06.170 --> 16:10.492
So he personifies your fit, Royal Marine.

16:10.492 --> 16:12.142
- Cheers mate, see you in a bit.

16:12.142 --> 16:15.393
(dramatic music)

16:15.393 --> 16:18.353
Quick change again, just in case.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.380
(dramatic music)

16:20.380 --> 16:23.510
Every military person watching
this will be looking at it

16:23.510 --> 16:26.710
going this guy's gonna get to the end.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.880
And it wouldn't be worth
me turning up to work

16:28.880 --> 16:30.973
on Monday morning having been caught,

16:32.070 --> 16:34.773
the stake, oh it would be horrendous.

16:36.470 --> 16:40.610
- Right, Harry and Frank,
two young guys, brothers.

16:40.610 --> 16:43.310
- Harry, he's got a big online presence.

16:43.310 --> 16:44.793
Thousands of followers on Instagram,

16:44.793 --> 16:47.240
he's got lots and lots
of friends on Facebook.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.430
- But Frank is virtually gone,

16:49.430 --> 16:51.334
a ghost on the internet so far.

16:51.334 --> 16:52.464
(sheep bleating)

16:52.464 --> 16:53.297
(dramatic music)

16:53.297 --> 16:54.810
- Harry would be watching Love Island

16:54.810 --> 16:57.830
about this sort of time
wouldn't you Harry?

16:57.830 --> 16:59.413
- I'm used to the city life.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.960
- Me and Harry couldn't be
more different as people.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.010
- We're so different.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.520
Frank isn't one to go out and party,

17:08.520 --> 17:10.573
whereas I like to socialize.

17:11.590 --> 17:14.233
Frank is very much work orientated,

17:15.350 --> 17:16.753
relax a little, jeez.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.667
Ah, Frank, can we go round?

17:20.667 --> 17:24.120
- [Frank] No, go straight
through, it's the only way.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.938
Don't be scared of them.

17:25.938 --> 17:27.515
(blows raspberry)

17:27.515 --> 17:29.035
(cows mooing)

17:29.035 --> 17:29.868
- [Frank] Oh fuck mate.

17:29.868 --> 17:32.143
- Frank, can you take my hand then?

17:34.383 --> 17:36.555
(cows mooing)

17:36.555 --> 17:37.388
- Go on.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.100
I think I'm protective of Harry one,

17:41.100 --> 17:46.100
because he's gay and two I
see him like a second sister.

17:46.257 --> 17:47.090
- What?

17:48.990 --> 17:49.900
Why have you said that?

17:49.900 --> 17:51.656
It makes no sense at all.

17:51.656 --> 17:53.860
(dramatic music)

17:53.860 --> 17:58.170
- Steve, I've got some
CCTV on Sandhills Station.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.666
- That's Nicholas and Paul.

17:59.666 --> 18:00.499
- Yeah it is.

18:00.499 --> 18:01.690
- It's Nicholas and Paul.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.103
- Right, let's look at
the time tables, 12:58.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.193
So maybe they're going,

18:08.193 --> 18:09.690
they're just trying to
get as far as the can--

18:09.690 --> 18:10.523
- Yup.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.356
- As quick as they can.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.290
- On public transport, school boy errors.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.418
- It is school boy errors.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.030
(dramatic music)

18:16.030 --> 18:17.283
- So far so good.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.350
Basically what we got on our
side at this moment in time

18:20.350 --> 18:21.760
is luck if we don't get that luck

18:21.760 --> 18:24.040
then all we're playing don't mean shit.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.098
The thing is being on the road--

18:25.098 --> 18:27.988
(speaking quickly over himself)

18:27.988 --> 18:30.316
The police are only gonna be lucky once.

18:30.316 --> 18:33.066
(dramatic music)

18:34.520 --> 18:37.340
- Can we pull up the footage
we've got of them in Liverpool?

18:37.340 --> 18:39.308
We'll bring it on the big screen.

18:39.308 --> 18:40.330
(suspenseful music)

18:40.330 --> 18:43.183
That's after leaving the boat,
these are in the City Center,

18:44.050 --> 18:47.120
and these are at Sandhills Train Station.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.980
- Can I make an immediate observation?

18:48.980 --> 18:50.060
- [Man] Yeah.

18:50.060 --> 18:53.020
- The trailing figure
there has distinctive

18:53.020 --> 18:56.270
white soles to his shoes.

18:56.270 --> 19:00.350
There appears to be no white
soles on either of the shoes

19:00.350 --> 19:02.620
of the pictures that we
know are the fugitives.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.220
- [Woman] Yup.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.370
- So this is them
getting into the station.

19:08.340 --> 19:09.219
- [Peter] White soles.

19:09.219 --> 19:10.470
- Yeah.

19:10.470 --> 19:12.500
The figure at the back
there, he looks small,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.990
like the way he moves is like a young man.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.660
- [Man] Okay, definitely
not the same person

19:17.660 --> 19:18.493
that got into the car--

19:18.493 --> 19:19.326
- [All Together] No.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.351
- So we reverse back, we've
got the ANPR on that car.

19:22.351 --> 19:24.230
We see where else that car has gone.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.980
(dramatic music)

19:32.110 --> 19:33.950
- [Narrator] All the
fugitives are now lying low

19:33.950 --> 19:36.060
in rural locations.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.440
Loren has traveled the furthest distance,

19:38.440 --> 19:40.493
over 300 miles north.

19:43.019 --> 19:45.186
(beeping)

19:47.420 --> 19:48.320
- You get any trouble--

19:48.320 --> 19:49.283
- Yeah.

19:49.283 --> 19:50.116
- Phone me.

19:50.116 --> 19:50.949
- I will.

19:50.949 --> 19:52.540
- [Narrator] Loren has
been driven to Fort William

19:52.540 --> 19:53.610
by her cousin.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.783
- Bye David!

19:55.617 --> 19:57.517
- [Narrator] Now she's going it alone.

19:58.377 --> 20:01.110
- When you get an idea
of where you're gonna go,

20:01.110 --> 20:03.693
makes it easier but at
the minute I'm like,

20:04.980 --> 20:06.090
not a clue.

20:06.090 --> 20:07.453
Haven't got anyone with me.

20:08.419 --> 20:11.403
(laughs) I'm scared.

20:13.660 --> 20:16.590
I'll just walk as far
as I can for a minute,

20:16.590 --> 20:17.490
just keep walking.

20:19.490 --> 20:21.190
I've pretty much winged
it the whole of my life

20:21.190 --> 20:23.990
so I'm hoping it will just
still work for this (laughs).

20:25.140 --> 20:28.750
I'm rubbish at maths
but I work in banking,

20:28.750 --> 20:29.710
I don't have a clue about banking

20:29.710 --> 20:33.000
I just saw the job description
and thought I can do that.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.440
It's embarrassing 'cause you
got all these proper walkers

20:35.440 --> 20:37.980
and their backpacks are the size of them

20:37.980 --> 20:39.840
and they got these big ass walkin shoes on

20:39.840 --> 20:41.717
and then there's me with
me Prime Hot gym leggings

20:41.717 --> 20:44.373
and me kids Nike's out of Sports Direct.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.150
I'm not well traveled, I've never,

20:48.150 --> 20:50.963
ever stayed around anyone
else's house, ever.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.310
But now I'm going halfway
across the country on my own,

20:56.310 --> 20:58.830
without a flipping car even.

20:58.830 --> 21:03.363
Oh look, I've never been
this close to sheep?

21:04.910 --> 21:05.764
Are they sheep?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.597
(sheep bleating)

21:06.597 --> 21:07.811
Yeah they just baa'ed.

21:07.811 --> 21:10.870
Aw, look at the little one munchin.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.283
Sorry love.

21:13.283 --> 21:14.956
(sheep bleats)

21:14.956 --> 21:16.602
(imitates sheep noise)

21:16.602 --> 21:19.120
(slow dramatic music)

21:19.120 --> 21:20.470
- I've been looking a lot about Loren

21:20.470 --> 21:22.480
and I think this kinda
sums her up perfectly

21:22.480 --> 21:24.520
when we saw her running out of the boat

21:24.520 --> 21:27.720
and she's dropping things
but she's still determined.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.110
I think she's smart but not necessarily

21:30.110 --> 21:32.160
has a lot of common sense.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.710
Somebody that's not methodical,
doesn't think things through

21:34.710 --> 21:36.460
at all times, but a little bit,

21:36.460 --> 21:39.100
so plans may be strategically
but not tactically.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.590
So I know I wanna go there

21:40.590 --> 21:43.430
but I don't really know
how I'm gonna get there.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.580
- [Narrator] The hunters
have been tasked to search

21:45.580 --> 21:47.390
Lorens family home in Essex.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.240
(car door slams)

21:50.240 --> 21:51.260
- Jeanette?

21:51.260 --> 21:52.093
- Hello.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.520
- Hello.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.490
So you probably expected
a knock on the door,

21:55.490 --> 21:56.420
we've got a job to do.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.250
What are your daughters plans?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.083
Where is she gonna go?

21:59.083 --> 21:59.916
- She's not got a plan.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.400
- You talk to her everyday?

22:01.400 --> 22:03.013
- Used too, until she went away yeah.

22:03.013 --> 22:04.670
- [Hunter] Well as until yesterday,

22:04.670 --> 22:05.503
you talked to her everyday?

22:05.503 --> 22:06.336
- Yeah, yeah.

22:06.336 --> 22:07.169
- [Hunter] Okay.

22:07.169 --> 22:09.450
- This is the longest we'll
have ever gone without speaking.

22:09.450 --> 22:12.340
(dramatic music)

22:12.340 --> 22:15.120
- I do spend a lot of
time looking after my mum.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.700
She suffered with acrophobia,

22:17.700 --> 22:21.280
a fear of basically going outside
or being in public spaces.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.190
I hate leaving her, I feel really guilty

22:23.190 --> 22:26.213
'cause I know that she's
not really got anyone else.

22:26.213 --> 22:28.077
Aw, I feel a bit sad for her.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.697
But if I won the money,
I'd really like to pay

22:32.697 --> 22:34.960
for the treatment she needs to help her

22:34.960 --> 22:37.040
just have some kinda quality of life.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.790
Not only would it change my
life, it would change hers.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.477
(dramatic music)

22:44.863 --> 22:47.965
(items clinking)

22:47.965 --> 22:51.343
(paper rustling)

22:51.343 --> 22:53.263
(phone camera shutters)

22:53.263 --> 22:54.096
- Bingo.

23:00.060 --> 23:04.205
- The headline really is, yeah
she's rung her mum 247 times

23:04.205 --> 23:06.890
in a month according to the phone billing.

23:06.890 --> 23:09.490
They talk to each other day in, day out.

23:09.490 --> 23:12.630
- Interestingly during
a search of the bedroom

23:12.630 --> 23:15.600
the very bottom end of her handbag

23:15.600 --> 23:18.162
there's a vague itinerary.

23:18.162 --> 23:22.510
Checked it out, photographed it.

23:22.510 --> 23:24.840
- [Woman] This is the note
that Mark and Carl found.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.220
- Of course it could be a decoy.

23:26.220 --> 23:28.100
Look here as well.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.010
Use ATM straight away--
- Straight away.

23:30.010 --> 23:30.843
- [Ben] Which she did.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.990
- [Woman] Yup.

23:31.990 --> 23:33.010
Outfit change.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.080
- Which she did, there is
elements of truth in there.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.130
- 'cause she's got, Gretna Green,

23:37.130 --> 23:39.610
looks like to Fort William question mark.

23:39.610 --> 23:41.080
- Yeah I mean her mom's side of the family

23:41.080 --> 23:42.485
is all up there in Scotland.

23:42.485 --> 23:46.030
(suspenseful music)

23:46.030 --> 23:49.250
- Okay, Dan, Jordan, we found
a note at Loren's property

23:49.250 --> 23:52.320
which suggests she may be
headed to Fort William.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.040
Bit of a pump but I'm gonna get you guys

23:54.040 --> 23:55.496
to heading that direction please

23:55.496 --> 23:56.810
and I'll update you more on route.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.640
- Roger that we're just on our way north

23:59.640 --> 24:00.540
about 18 miles out.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.373
- Roger that.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.130
- [Narrator] With Fort William
only covering a small area

24:05.130 --> 24:07.730
of eight kilometers, Chief Peter Bleksley

24:07.730 --> 24:09.800
is reaching out to local businesses,

24:09.800 --> 24:12.010
campsites, and hotels.

24:12.010 --> 24:14.890
- Yes, I was wondering if you
and your fellow staff members

24:14.890 --> 24:17.570
and guests would be kind
enough to keep your eyes

24:17.570 --> 24:18.743
and ears peeled?

24:18.743 --> 24:19.640
- [Woman On Phone] Yes.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.480
- She's 26 years old,

24:21.480 --> 24:24.270
she's got distinctive long blonde hair.

24:24.270 --> 24:25.103
- [Man On Phone] All right.

24:25.103 --> 24:27.400
- They may well qualify for a cash reward

24:27.400 --> 24:29.440
if their information leads to her capture.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.565
- [Woman On Phone] All right, okay.

24:31.565 --> 24:34.005
(light suspenseful music)

24:34.005 --> 24:35.403
(birds chirping)

24:35.403 --> 24:36.236
- Excuse me?

24:37.357 --> 24:39.493
Hello, can I come in quickly?

24:40.670 --> 24:44.250
Basically, I don't know
if any of yous can help,

24:44.250 --> 24:45.821
but is that your tractor out in the front?

24:45.821 --> 24:46.654
- Yeah.

24:46.654 --> 24:48.381
- Have you got any room for me?

24:48.381 --> 24:49.720
I know that's so random

24:49.720 --> 24:52.540
but I just need to get like
as far away as possible.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.373
I'm on the run.

24:53.373 --> 24:55.632
- I'll tell you what,
come and I'll show you.

24:55.632 --> 24:56.465
- Okay.

24:56.465 --> 24:57.298
- I'll show you this--

24:57.298 --> 24:58.976
- (laughs nervously) Thank you.

24:58.976 --> 25:00.563
- I'll be perfectly honest with you.

25:00.563 --> 25:01.396
- Yeah.

25:01.396 --> 25:02.304
- I'm not one of these horrible people-

25:02.304 --> 25:03.137
- Yeah, yeah.

25:03.137 --> 25:05.810
- That's gonna grass you in.

25:05.810 --> 25:07.020
- This is proper Bear Grylls.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.480
- Follow it right the way up,

25:08.480 --> 25:11.000
you'll come onto a gravel path.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.530
Take a left, follow that
path, ride out the zig zags,

25:13.530 --> 25:15.107
it'll take you wherever you wanna go.

25:15.107 --> 25:16.906
- Ah, give me some lovin.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.426
- Thank you.
- Best of luck.

25:18.426 --> 25:20.296
- Thank you, see ya.

25:20.296 --> 25:23.046
(cheerful music)

25:26.590 --> 25:27.837
Well this is rural (laughs).

25:31.350 --> 25:32.950
I forgot his directions already.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.840
(phone rings)

25:35.840 --> 25:37.067
- [Peter] It's the Chief.

25:37.067 --> 25:38.340
- [Man On Phone] Hello, is that Peter?

25:38.340 --> 25:39.328
- [Peter] Yeah.

25:39.328 --> 25:40.810
- [Man On Phone] What reward do we get

25:40.810 --> 25:43.040
for grassing someone in?

25:43.040 --> 25:46.610
- If it's a direct result
of what you tell me

25:46.610 --> 25:50.928
that leads to capture then I
can guarantee you 500 Quid.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.549
- [Man On Phone] Well
we seen someone earlier.

25:52.549 --> 25:54.940
We actually spoke to someone earlier.

25:54.940 --> 25:55.773
Her name was Loren.

25:55.773 --> 25:57.820
Loren, is that her name?

25:57.820 --> 25:59.286
- [Peter] Yeah that's right, yeah.

25:59.286 --> 26:00.858
- [Man On Phone] She came
into the Ben Nevis distillery.

26:00.858 --> 26:01.691
- [Peter] Yup.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.070
- [Man On Phone] One of the boys told her

26:03.070 --> 26:06.063
to go up to the back, there's
a path that leads up the back.

26:06.063 --> 26:08.832
She was heading to the
North Face car park.

26:08.832 --> 26:12.440
(suspenseful music)

26:12.440 --> 26:14.292
- Really really don't know why I decided

26:14.292 --> 26:16.013
that this would be a good idea.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.470
- [Peter] That's a game changer.

26:18.470 --> 26:20.990
- She doesn't know about
us being right on her tail.

26:20.990 --> 26:22.720
She's got no plans, she's
not gonna be in a rush.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.900
She thinks we're miles away.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.240
- She's essentially trapped.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.203
- All right come on
then, let's get on this.

26:31.570 --> 26:35.070
- She stays on foot,
she ain't goin nowhere.

26:35.070 --> 26:37.441
- No the only way is back to Essex.

26:37.441 --> 26:40.656
(both hunters laughing)

26:40.656 --> 26:44.438
(electricity buzzing)

26:44.438 --> 26:47.726
(electricity buzzing)

26:47.726 --> 26:49.480
(dramatic music)

26:49.480 --> 26:50.313
- What did he say?

26:50.313 --> 26:51.343
Follow the road?

26:52.780 --> 26:54.930
There's two roads.

26:54.930 --> 26:56.520
- [Narrator] Following
a tip off from a local

26:56.520 --> 26:59.470
in Fort William, the
hunters are in close pursuit

26:59.470 --> 27:02.016
of single fugitive Loren.

27:02.016 --> 27:04.900
- Let's have a little butchers at this.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.246
Oh wow.

27:06.246 --> 27:08.250
(car engine whirs)

27:08.250 --> 27:09.880
- There's the distillery there.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.117
- Peter said she headed
off towards the back

27:12.117 --> 27:14.360
of the distillery which is southeast,

27:14.360 --> 27:16.050
which takes you up to somewhere called

27:16.050 --> 27:17.483
the North Face car park.

27:18.530 --> 27:20.360
- What do I do, what do I do?

27:20.360 --> 27:21.193
What's that?

27:21.193 --> 27:24.080
I'm gonna go down there and
look down that way, follow me.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.478
Let's make tracks.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.478
(suspenseful music)

27:29.929 --> 27:33.179
- [Both In Unison] North Face car park.

27:35.086 --> 27:35.919
- [Jordan] We need to keep our eyes

27:35.919 --> 27:36.752
peeled here 'cause--

27:36.752 --> 27:38.052
- [Dan] Yeah she could be anywhere.

27:38.052 --> 27:41.052
(suspenseful music)

27:46.122 --> 27:47.710
- All right.

27:47.710 --> 27:49.387
Where to go from here?

27:50.983 --> 27:53.240
I think the hunters will underestimate me.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.770
Young girl, she's not gonna
have a clue what she's doing

27:56.770 --> 27:59.880
but actually, when people
are up against something

27:59.880 --> 28:01.561
and the adrenaline's going,

28:01.561 --> 28:04.030
you'd be surprised what humans can do

28:04.030 --> 28:07.060
and I wanna prove that
to people, I can do this.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.060
There'll be someone around eventually.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.372
(suspenseful music)

28:11.372 --> 28:12.440
- All right then, go ahead.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.730
- Yeah we went to the North Face car park

28:16.050 --> 28:19.827
and it's pretty remote and
she wasn't present there.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.913
Where the fuck is she?

28:25.114 --> 28:27.114
- No way, there's yurts.

28:28.503 --> 28:29.336
Hello?

28:31.074 --> 28:31.907
Hello?

28:32.943 --> 28:33.776
Excuse me?

28:35.396 --> 28:37.500
I don't know if you're
able to help in any way,

28:37.500 --> 28:38.910
I don't expect anything for free

28:38.910 --> 28:40.226
but even just to tent on your land.

28:40.226 --> 28:42.837
- [Woman] You're totally
fine, that's perfectly fine.

28:42.837 --> 28:45.760
- Thank you so much, thank you.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.180
- There's something I should tell you.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.013
- [Loren] Yeah?

28:48.013 --> 28:50.020
- The one's that are coming to find you

28:50.020 --> 28:51.724
have already phoned me.

28:51.724 --> 28:52.557
- [Loren] What?

28:52.557 --> 28:54.404
- The one's that are coming to find you.

28:54.404 --> 28:55.237
- [Loren] No.

28:55.237 --> 28:56.070
- Yes.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.630
- Oh no, I'm gonna go
then, I'm not gonna stay,

28:57.630 --> 28:59.306
not gonna stay, I don't wanna get caught,

28:59.306 --> 29:01.120
I don't wanna get caught.

29:01.120 --> 29:01.953
Shit.

29:04.495 --> 29:06.500
I can carry on walking but
if the weather gets worse

29:06.500 --> 29:09.773
and I don't find anywhere
then I'm stuffed.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.020
Excuse me?

29:13.020 --> 29:14.551
I don't suppose you've got a car have ya?

29:14.551 --> 29:15.676
- I've got a van out there, yeah.

29:15.676 --> 29:16.840
- Would you be able to drop me somewhere?

29:16.840 --> 29:17.807
- Where do you want to go?

29:17.807 --> 29:18.640
- Anywhere.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.695
(dramatic music)

29:20.695 --> 29:22.770
- I think knocking on
doors in the local area,

29:22.770 --> 29:24.720
getting some help is the most likely.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.960
There's not many, if any,

29:26.960 --> 29:29.693
campsites that she can get to on foot.

29:30.565 --> 29:33.250
- With a little sprinkling
of luck with this one.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.113
We're in the right place,
we're not that far behind her.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.043
- I'm just getting a little bit scared.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.823
- [Home Owner] Don't panic.

29:42.330 --> 29:43.163
- Thank you!

29:47.263 --> 29:48.992
Oh my God, how can this happen?

29:48.992 --> 29:50.565
(suspenseful music)

29:50.565 --> 29:54.148
(speaking over each other)

29:55.194 --> 29:56.990
- Great Glen.
- Great Glen Yurts.

29:56.990 --> 29:57.823
Should we have a look in there?

29:57.823 --> 29:58.720
- [Dan] Yeah absolutely.

29:59.825 --> 30:02.825
(suspenseful music)

30:07.053 --> 30:10.732
- Ah, my heart is racing, wow.

30:10.732 --> 30:13.732
(suspenseful music)

30:21.830 --> 30:22.895
- She's not here.

30:22.895 --> 30:23.728
- No.

30:23.728 --> 30:25.410
(suspenseful music)

30:25.410 --> 30:28.210
No sightings, nobodies seen
anything, heard anything.

30:28.210 --> 30:30.010
- Okay guys, we'll still keep looking

30:30.010 --> 30:31.722
in the hope that she's
still in that region.

30:31.722 --> 30:34.472
(dramatic music)

30:38.710 --> 30:39.560
- Ladies and gentleman,

30:39.560 --> 30:41.980
can we gather round the table please.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.970
We've got a wealth of
information amongst us here,

30:44.970 --> 30:48.240
we go through everything to make sure

30:48.240 --> 30:52.870
that every i is dotted
and every t is crossed.

30:52.870 --> 30:55.960
Frank and Harry, where are we at?

30:55.960 --> 30:56.793
- [Woman] We were able to establish

30:56.793 --> 30:58.360
that they got into a vehicle.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.370
- Looks like the driver of
the vehicle has taken them

31:00.370 --> 31:02.910
out of Liverpool and then dropped them off

31:02.910 --> 31:04.573
somewhere around Chester.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.589
- Fancy giving us a lift?

31:07.589 --> 31:08.422
- Where are you going?

31:08.422 --> 31:10.163
- [Frank] As far down stream as possible.

31:10.163 --> 31:10.996
- Yeah, yeah.

31:10.996 --> 31:11.829
- [Harry] Are you sure?

31:11.829 --> 31:13.226
- [Frank] Good man mate.

31:13.226 --> 31:15.494
Come on and find us Peter.

31:15.494 --> 31:19.128
Come and find us (laughs).

31:19.128 --> 31:20.750
- Nathanael and Ismail.

31:20.750 --> 31:22.190
- Nathanael studied Architecture

31:22.190 --> 31:24.970
and Ismail studied
Architectural Technology

31:24.970 --> 31:26.930
at Huddersfield at the same time.

31:26.930 --> 31:29.330
- [Woman] They were last
seen on CCTV rollerblading

31:29.330 --> 31:30.550
through the City Center.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.430
- They just disappeared from there?

31:32.430 --> 31:33.263
- So we're here.

31:34.810 --> 31:38.093
- Out here in the wilderness,
that's my David Attenborough.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.643
I can do Nigerian David Attenborough.

31:42.779 --> 31:44.441
Out here in the wilderness.

31:44.441 --> 31:47.507
(Nathanael laughs)

31:47.507 --> 31:50.770
- Amber and Jess, we know
are linked through work,

31:50.770 --> 31:53.550
both nurses from different fields.

31:53.550 --> 31:57.630
We've saw them on CCTV boarding a vehicle.

31:57.630 --> 32:01.260
We then got ANPR hits
northbound on the Alpha 59.

32:01.260 --> 32:04.969
Progressively we're thinking
continuing north at this point.

32:04.969 --> 32:07.030
- Ramsbottom (laughs).

32:07.030 --> 32:08.100
- Oh my God Emma.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.080
If we can get to the peaks
or the lakes, we're sorted.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.083
- The UK is our Arista at the mome.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.410
- [Peter] Okay, where are we at with Matt?

32:16.410 --> 32:20.700
- He was seen withdrawing Â£100
at James Street on the ATM

32:20.700 --> 32:22.710
and he was very undercover.

32:22.710 --> 32:26.300
Three minutes later, he's
completely changed his outfit.

32:26.300 --> 32:29.029
- He's still currently
serving Royal Marine Commando.

32:29.029 --> 32:32.900
What I think with this guy,
he has a plan to stay rural

32:32.900 --> 32:34.470
so we have to be really, really, careful

32:34.470 --> 32:36.410
with where we're drawn
into that environment.

32:36.410 --> 32:38.810
- He will reveal in the
challenge of testing us.

32:40.483 --> 32:42.401
- If I wanna be a fugitive,
I'm gonna be a fugitive

32:42.401 --> 32:43.533
on the offensive.

32:43.533 --> 32:47.530
I wanna be in the top of the
biggest, baddest mountain

32:47.530 --> 32:49.450
I can find in the area.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.330
You're not gonna get hunters
really into mountain distance

32:51.330 --> 32:52.163
to find me.

32:53.230 --> 32:55.160
I am gonna pop up, and when I do pop up,

32:55.160 --> 32:56.550
it's gonna be on my terms.

32:56.550 --> 32:58.770
(dramatic music)

32:58.770 --> 33:01.343
- [Peter] Right, Nic and Paul we now know,

33:02.270 --> 33:05.590
the men at the train station were decoys.

33:05.590 --> 33:07.120
- They're next on my list then too.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.960
They've really pissed me off.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.840
So this Merc is of
particular interest to us.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.400
Registered to someone called David Seaman,

33:15.400 --> 33:16.970
not the David Seaman.

33:16.970 --> 33:18.491
- So we track the Mercedes in ANPR

33:18.491 --> 33:20.550
but unfortunately it's come
to a bit of a dead end.

33:20.550 --> 33:23.459
However, we are still keeping
David Seaman on monitoring

33:23.459 --> 33:25.720
as a person of interest.

33:25.720 --> 33:30.410
- It is by identifying and being
across the known associates

33:30.410 --> 33:34.160
that this fugitives will
inevitably rely upon

33:34.160 --> 33:35.903
that will get us back in the game.

33:38.038 --> 33:39.779
(beeping)

33:39.779 --> 33:42.362
(birds cawing)

33:45.129 --> 33:46.046
- Nic, Nic!

33:49.830 --> 33:50.663
Go on.

33:50.663 --> 33:52.746
(laughs)

33:54.107 --> 33:56.024
- [Nicholas] Dick head.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.750
- [Narrator] So far Nicholas
and Paul have relied

33:59.750 --> 34:01.710
on their network of close associates

34:01.710 --> 34:03.543
to help them evade capture.

34:04.678 --> 34:07.720
(Paul making strange robotic sound)

34:07.720 --> 34:10.590
Having switched vehicles,
their friend David Seaman

34:10.590 --> 34:13.520
has taken them to the north
coast where they're waiting

34:13.520 --> 34:15.409
for their next pickup.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.460
- [Paul] Yeah that'll stop 'em mate,

34:17.460 --> 34:19.247
they'll never get in there (laughs).

34:20.099 --> 34:22.210
- Fuck off Paul.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.820
As we use everything Paul,
I'm just putting straight back

34:24.820 --> 34:27.450
where it's come from, then we
can just bolt if we need too.

34:27.450 --> 34:28.423
- [Paul] Yeah, wipe your
fingerprints off everything

34:28.423 --> 34:31.950
as well yeah, can't be
to careful (laughs).

34:31.950 --> 34:33.250
- Them days are over mate.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.577
I'd like to see myself as
public enemy number one,

34:36.577 --> 34:38.570
some sort of Robin Hood type of character.

34:38.570 --> 34:42.373
It would be rubbish, I was just a pest.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.003
I was an opportunist thief.

34:46.020 --> 34:47.910
My ass got ready five times in a row,

34:47.910 --> 34:49.860
five days in a row, I
think on the fourth day

34:49.860 --> 34:52.070
I gave them key, then realized
there was no door left

34:52.070 --> 34:54.233
that they can use so
didn't really need it.

34:55.540 --> 34:58.780
- Nicholas is a elite
youth support worker,

34:58.780 --> 35:00.600
Paul works in the construction industry,

35:00.600 --> 35:03.420
they're both ex drug users.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.390
We think the relationship is that Paul

35:05.390 --> 35:08.050
may have counseled Nicholas
through some tough times

35:08.050 --> 35:12.100
when he was recovering from
alcoholism and drug addiction.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.040
- Nic is now providing
counseling for people

35:14.040 --> 35:16.500
who are going through rehabilitation.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.010
He talks about his recovery

35:18.010 --> 35:20.150
and rehabilitation brothers and sisters.

35:20.150 --> 35:22.250
So I think they're quite
a close knit group.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.420
I've got a big list of
potential associates

35:24.420 --> 35:25.571
that we need to go through.

35:25.571 --> 35:29.040
(suspenseful music)

35:29.040 --> 35:29.873
- Zoey?

35:29.873 --> 35:31.630
Since this morning we've been listening

35:31.630 --> 35:33.900
in on David Seamans phone--
- Yes.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.790
- We've been monitoring
ingoing and outgoing calls.

35:36.790 --> 35:41.110
He's made a phone call to
someone called George Goody.

35:41.110 --> 35:43.740
- He's a friend of both of them.

35:43.740 --> 35:44.573
- [Woman] Is he?

35:44.573 --> 35:46.030
- Yeah, I've done a little bit of digging,

35:46.030 --> 35:50.520
it looks like he's also
a recovering addict.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.257
- So this was David that made the call?

35:52.257 --> 35:53.584
- [Woman] David made the call to George.

35:53.584 --> 35:56.275
- Be sure we get George
Goody a live intercept.

35:56.275 --> 35:57.601
- [Man] I think that's a great idea, yeah.

35:57.601 --> 35:59.432
(dramatic music)

35:59.432 --> 36:01.683
(car engine whirring)

36:01.683 --> 36:04.654
- George is George, he's real savvy.

36:04.654 --> 36:07.737
He knows, he's got an eye for danger.

36:09.391 --> 36:11.724
He knows what it looks like.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.290
- [Narrator] Continuing to use
their network to help them,

36:16.290 --> 36:19.000
Nic and Paul have prearranged
a lift from their friend

36:19.000 --> 36:22.099
George Goody to transport
them out of the area.

36:22.099 --> 36:24.849
(dramatic music)

36:29.847 --> 36:32.720
- Come on fucking George, where are ya?

36:32.720 --> 36:37.100
Skulking about in graveyards,
it's just not normal behavior.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.570
I would be suspicious

36:39.540 --> 36:42.963
and we've been here about 45 minutes.

36:44.322 --> 36:45.836
Which is 40 minutes to long.

36:45.836 --> 36:49.370
(suspenseful music)

36:49.370 --> 36:51.036
Just use the burner phone.

36:51.036 --> 36:55.024
Gotta call him Paul,
ya gotta call him mate.

36:55.024 --> 36:57.524
We need to get away from here.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.432
- [Paul] Hello?

37:00.432 --> 37:01.930
We're waiting for you now mate.

37:01.930 --> 37:03.580
- [Nicholas] We're at the church.

37:06.270 --> 37:08.540
- Guys we've got an intercepted call

37:08.540 --> 37:09.996
from George Goody's phone in relation

37:09.996 --> 37:12.323
to Nicholas Batchlor and Paul James.

37:15.187 --> 37:16.439
- [Nicholas On Phone] You can't be here,

37:16.439 --> 37:18.412
we're sitting in the church.

37:18.412 --> 37:22.162
Saint Martin's Church,
Saint Martin's Church.

37:23.176 --> 37:28.176
- All right mate, all right,
right, turn your phone off now

37:28.539 --> 37:30.217
George and turn it back on in 10 minutes.

37:30.217 --> 37:32.783
Turn it back on in 10
minutes if you can't find us.

37:34.048 --> 37:36.430
All right see you mate, bye mate, bye.

37:36.430 --> 37:39.110
- Poor old George got the church wrong.

37:39.110 --> 37:42.220
Right so that's Nic and
Paul confirmed together.

37:42.220 --> 37:44.650
- Location data tells us
that the nearest cell tower

37:44.650 --> 37:47.760
is on Mundazi Road in an
area called Overstrand

37:47.760 --> 37:49.110
right on the Norfolk coast.

37:50.010 --> 37:52.410
- Right, Saint Martin's
Church on the Norfolk coast,

37:52.410 --> 37:54.000
where exactly is it?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.270
- Chief it's just to the East of Kromer.

37:56.270 --> 37:58.600
- What's the nearest ground hunter team?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.562
- Unfortunately about three to four hours.

38:00.562 --> 38:02.948
It's his car, where ever George car is

38:02.948 --> 38:07.948
that what's key to getting them up here.

38:08.238 --> 38:09.252
- It's him, let's go.

38:09.252 --> 38:12.180
(suspenseful music)

38:12.180 --> 38:14.950
- George Goody, we've gotta
hope he's in his car haven't we.

38:14.950 --> 38:17.188
- He does own a black Lexus.

38:17.188 --> 38:20.650
(suspenseful music)

38:20.650 --> 38:21.860
- [Paul] George can you put in your,

38:21.860 --> 38:25.030
set it up for Bristol mate,
and be sure to avoid motorways,

38:25.030 --> 38:26.387
that'd be the fucking bullocks.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.912
(suspenseful music)

38:28.912 --> 38:33.070
(George speaking faintly)

38:33.070 --> 38:34.560
- Already at one percent.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.870
- George, it's good mate, don't worry.

38:35.870 --> 38:38.585
- We really don't (speaking
quickly over himself).

38:38.585 --> 38:40.325
- [George] They ain't
behind you yet right?

38:40.325 --> 38:41.452
- Not as far as we know.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.435
- I just don't wanna be the one,

38:43.435 --> 38:45.150
that you get caught.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.400
- We're right in the game here.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.538
Please everybody just do what we gotta do.

38:48.538 --> 38:50.450
(intense dramatic music)

38:50.450 --> 38:54.330
Nic and Paul's original decoy was clever,

38:54.330 --> 38:56.450
I give them credit.

38:56.450 --> 38:59.878
We want them to think
we've fallen for the ruse.

38:59.878 --> 39:03.888
Where actual facts, we may
be getting rather close.

39:03.888 --> 39:07.305
(suspenseful music)

39:07.305 --> 39:10.472
(electricity buzzing)

39:11.343 --> 39:14.510
(electricity buzzing)

39:16.392 --> 39:18.097
- They're gonna rely on you
to get tired, mentally tired

39:18.097 --> 39:20.590
and that's when you start making mistakes.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.770
- [Narrator] For the last
six hours close associate

39:22.770 --> 39:25.300
George Goody has been driving Nic and Paul

39:25.300 --> 39:27.560
along a network of A roads.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.600
- We ain't goin down no motorways,

39:29.600 --> 39:32.420
so the ANPR they might hit it sporadically

39:32.420 --> 39:36.032
but they're not gonna get no
definitive route out of it.

39:36.032 --> 39:38.410
- Guys we've got another ANPR hit

39:38.410 --> 39:41.163
on the A420 heading west.

39:42.060 --> 39:43.650
- Right down towards Bristol.

39:43.650 --> 39:46.860
So they've effectively traveled
across the bottom of the UK.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.830
- [Narrator] The hunters have
used ANPR to track the vehicle

39:49.830 --> 39:51.730
to the outskirts of Bristol

39:51.730 --> 39:54.180
where the trail has now stopped.

39:54.180 --> 39:57.270
- Got Drew and Nick, ETA to
Bristol about 25 minutes.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.030
- This looks like it's
serving a point as a drop off

40:00.030 --> 40:02.740
or a handover point to another associate.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.650
- They've gone from David
Seaman, to George Goody,

40:05.650 --> 40:08.473
and the question I want
answered is, who's next?

40:09.845 --> 40:10.982
- Thank you for seeing
us across the coast.

40:10.982 --> 40:12.455
- All the best mate.

40:12.455 --> 40:13.995
- Drive safe, I'll see you
in the weekend maybe yeah.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.279
- Right.

40:15.279 --> 40:18.110
(suspenseful music)

40:18.110 --> 40:19.455
- Hello love.

40:19.455 --> 40:21.200
How you doin kid?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.200
- [Woman In Car] Hi!

40:23.830 --> 40:28.040
- Okay I've found a connection,
both of them are friends

40:28.040 --> 40:31.500
with this same person, Caroline Hogan,

40:31.500 --> 40:32.560
she's there in Bristol.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.910
- [Woman] She's in Prachek as well.

40:33.910 --> 40:37.470
- Yeah, she's very distinctive,
she's got bright pink hair.

40:37.470 --> 40:38.350
- Helps us.

40:38.350 --> 40:39.790
- [Julie] Yeah.

40:39.790 --> 40:43.340
(suspenseful music)

40:43.340 --> 40:44.173
- [Nicholas] Thank you for this.

40:44.173 --> 40:45.380
- [Paul] Yeah thank you so much.

40:45.380 --> 40:46.397
- Are you joking?

40:46.397 --> 40:49.767
It's like the most exciting
thing to happen to me for ages.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.054
You're gonna have to look
after yourself at my house

40:51.054 --> 40:52.410
a bit though, is that all
right if I just leave you?

40:52.410 --> 40:53.600
- [Nicholas] No you're absolutely fine.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.041
- Good 'cause I'm going to see
the Rolling Stones tomorrow.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.540
(dramatic music)

40:57.540 --> 40:59.140
- [Narrator] Two teams of ground hunters

40:59.140 --> 41:02.460
have already been tasked to
make their way to Bristol.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.240
- We've identified a close
associate in that area,

41:05.240 --> 41:08.700
Caroline Hogan, she lives
just to the northeast,

41:08.700 --> 41:10.850
that's on your mapping,
she's got a vehicle,

41:10.850 --> 41:13.120
black Nissan, she's the best guess.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.690
I think Hogan is the
next piece of the puzzle.

41:16.690 --> 41:19.616
- We are 11 minutes out from that address.

41:19.616 --> 41:24.616
- Fantastic (speech muffled by music).

41:24.694 --> 41:28.070
- So this is our escape
vehicle, no saddles,

41:28.070 --> 41:29.570
no experience in riding zebras,

41:29.570 --> 41:32.330
you don't get a lot of that in London.

41:32.330 --> 41:33.783
Paul's got the unicorn.

41:35.640 --> 41:36.913
It's gonna be a good day.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.290
- [Narrator] Caroline
has gone to get supplies,

41:40.290 --> 41:42.980
leaving Nic and Paul alone in the house.

41:42.980 --> 41:44.430
- Look I'm not going nowhere,

41:44.430 --> 41:46.639
there's no reason we need to leave here.

41:46.639 --> 41:49.552
Don't mean we're gonna let our guard down.

41:49.552 --> 41:50.385
- No.

41:50.385 --> 41:51.600
- [Nicholas] We can let our guard down.

41:51.600 --> 41:54.173
- You're stupid, not one
minute can we do that for.

41:55.540 --> 41:58.140
- The worry is we go
in, it's just Caroline,

41:58.140 --> 42:00.200
the boys aren't there and
she'll get word to the next.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.510
- [Man] We'd blow the whole thing yeah.

42:02.510 --> 42:04.700
- Let's just remain unsighted if we can.

42:04.700 --> 42:05.533
- Roger that.

42:05.533 --> 42:07.430
I'm kinda hoping they pop out for a fag

42:07.430 --> 42:08.580
and we can see that.

42:10.053 --> 42:12.803
(lighter clicks)

42:14.129 --> 42:16.689
- Right you just stay there for a minute.

42:16.689 --> 42:19.689
(suspenseful music)

42:21.050 --> 42:22.630
- Hers is literally that house there

42:22.630 --> 42:23.780
that faces out to the road.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.329
So if we--

42:25.329 --> 42:28.579
(turn signal clicking)

42:32.478 --> 42:33.403
- Who's that?

42:33.403 --> 42:36.403
(suspenseful music)

42:39.280 --> 42:40.579
who's that?

42:40.579 --> 42:43.579
(suspenseful music)

42:49.451 --> 42:52.943
- I've come to tune the piano.

42:55.429 --> 42:57.529
Well I just gotta go and change me boxers.

42:59.328 --> 43:01.293
(laughs)

43:01.293 --> 43:03.520
(car engines whirring)

43:03.520 --> 43:04.510
- [Man On Phone] You okay guys?

43:04.510 --> 43:06.010
- [Hunter] Ay mate.

43:06.010 --> 43:08.160
- Just very quick, we were
just doing some map analysis,

43:08.160 --> 43:10.080
if we can get one north and one south

43:10.080 --> 43:11.800
and box it off from a distance,

43:11.800 --> 43:13.390
just gonna need to keep a long look

43:13.390 --> 43:16.053
and eyes on to that
vehicle, for foot traffic.

43:17.305 --> 43:18.138
Corbin?

43:18.138 --> 43:18.971
- Yes?

43:18.971 --> 43:21.237
- Would you have a look to
deploy on foot round to the back

43:21.237 --> 43:22.460
of the rural area?

43:22.460 --> 43:24.064
- Okay buddy, okay.

43:24.064 --> 43:27.064
(suspenseful music)

43:34.360 --> 43:36.530
It's not very fucking public is it?

43:36.530 --> 43:38.227
Right, you fucker.

43:38.227 --> 43:41.227
(suspenseful music)

43:44.351 --> 43:46.290
Just confirmed, is that number one?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.190
Does it actually back onto this field?

43:49.327 --> 43:51.826
(dog barking)

43:51.826 --> 43:55.164
Ay mate, which one's number one mate?

43:55.164 --> 43:55.997
- What?

43:55.997 --> 43:57.221
- Which one's number one?

43:57.221 --> 44:00.221
(suspenseful music)

44:02.630 --> 44:04.301
- We're gonna wash all our clothes

44:04.301 --> 44:05.968
and have a nice bath

44:07.691 --> 44:09.527
and once the wash is
done, we're gonna pack up,

44:09.527 --> 44:12.341
they're ready, they're just ready yeah.

44:12.341 --> 44:13.291
- Yeah.

44:13.291 --> 44:15.127
(Nicholas laughs)

44:15.127 --> 44:16.377
- I'm Caroline.

44:17.266 --> 44:19.518
- [Nicholas] Fucking hell, you loon.

44:19.518 --> 44:22.981
(suspenseful music)

44:22.981 --> 44:24.994
- Just to let you know I've
got eyes on the back garden,

44:24.994 --> 44:28.968
that back patio doors are open.

44:28.968 --> 44:30.453
Paul do you got eyes on the actual front

44:30.453 --> 44:32.929
of the property mate?

44:32.929 --> 44:35.220
- No, negative Steve.

44:35.220 --> 44:39.340
- I'm just a bit worried because
one of the neighbors saw us

44:39.340 --> 44:42.693
and I will saw this is a
close knit place if you like.

44:44.850 --> 44:45.683
- Oh shit.

44:47.610 --> 44:48.443
Yeah, Ben?

44:50.010 --> 44:52.360
Unit's stand by, active, the black Nissan

44:52.360 --> 44:54.100
has just gone past our vehicle.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.777
- Okay Steve you read it.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.180
- [Steve] Yeah got you mate.

44:57.180 --> 44:59.400
- The Nissan is back towards the property

44:59.400 --> 45:02.429
it's potential the registered
vehicle for Caroline.

45:02.429 --> 45:05.892
- [Steve] I'm just trying
to get a little bit closer.

45:05.892 --> 45:08.426
(breathes deeply)

45:08.426 --> 45:11.593
(playing piano notes)

45:14.040 --> 45:15.576
- They supposed to be in
the field with a camera?

45:15.576 --> 45:16.409
- [Nicholas] What?

45:16.409 --> 45:18.165
- That's what me neighbor just said.

45:18.165 --> 45:19.900
He said there was a man
bending down like this

45:19.900 --> 45:21.612
doing something with the gates.

45:21.612 --> 45:25.690
(other people speaking
faintly in background)

45:25.690 --> 45:27.715
He said what's going on at your house?

45:27.715 --> 45:30.715
(suspenseful music)

45:36.189 --> 45:39.289
So he said there was somebody
down there, with a camera

45:39.289 --> 45:41.380
and he said what are you doin?

45:41.380 --> 45:42.979
Why are you in this field?

45:42.979 --> 45:45.255
He said it was a man.

45:45.255 --> 45:46.519
- He actually spoke to them?

45:46.519 --> 45:48.029
- Yeah.

45:48.029 --> 45:48.862
Do I go and get him?

45:48.862 --> 45:49.819
- Yeah.

45:49.819 --> 45:52.819
(suspenseful music)

46:03.790 --> 46:04.767
Go, go, go!

46:05.669 --> 46:06.502
- Somebody's running.

46:06.502 --> 46:07.335
- [Hunter] Somebody's running.

46:07.335 --> 46:08.693
- Anybody got eyes on Paul?

46:10.010 --> 46:11.810
- Suddenly feel vulnerable.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.250
- [Man] What are they doing?

46:13.250 --> 46:14.390
- They look like the
people out of Scooby Doo.

46:14.390 --> 46:16.390
- Use your fucking brain Emma.

46:16.390 --> 46:18.560
- [Investigator] He is
essentially an elite soldier.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.680
Deploying the canine, we'll
have three ground hunter teams,

46:21.680 --> 46:24.515
the drone, so he's got nowhere to run.

46:24.515 --> 46:25.565
- Fucking hell.

46:25.565 --> 46:26.929
What am I gonna do now?

46:26.929 --> 46:29.679
(dramatic music)
