08:14.042 --> 08:16.417
you tell me

08:16.459 --> 08:17.709
you carved

08:17.710 --> 08:18.959
a moat in my hair?

08:20.751 --> 08:22.459
- I was hoping you
- wouldn't notice.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.042
- I'm gonna get you
- back for this, Bertram.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.584
Huh?

08:28.626 --> 08:30.147
You won't know

08:30.148 --> 08:31.667
how or when,

08:28.626 --> 08:31.667
but it will happen.

08:31.709 --> 08:33.085
Yeah. And that goes

08:33.086 --> 08:34.458
for you, too, Zuri.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.375
ZURI: There's no Zuri here!

08:38.417 --> 08:40.042
Just us pots and pans.

08:40.082 --> 08:42.833
Ow! And a corkscrew.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.834
Wow! Jessie!

08:47.876 --> 08:49.188
This place is way

08:49.189 --> 08:50.500
too nice for you.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.626
You, too.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.251
Why don't you go check

08:55.252 --> 08:56.834
into the Budget Hut

08:53.667 --> 08:56.834
on Queens Boulevard?

08:57.667 --> 08:59.500
That place is nice!

08:59.542 --> 09:01.375
- They wash the - sheets after
- Every guest.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.001
As if you would

09:04.002 --> 09:05.042
stay there.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.334
You, Brooks Wentworth III,

09:07.335 --> 09:09.584
my rich, perfect husband.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.042
Jessie, are you okay?

09:13.083 --> 09:14.459
Yes! I'm just nuts

09:14.460 --> 09:15.834
about you, Brooks!

09:15.876 --> 09:17.834
- And so are
- all of the kids.

09:17.876 --> 09:18.876
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

09:18.877 --> 09:19.877
It is true.

09:19.918 --> 09:21.709
- We are cray-cray
- about Brooks.

09:21.751 --> 09:23.250
- (WHISPERS)
- I feel so dirty.

09:24.959 --> 09:29.834
Yes. Darla does look dirty.

09:29.876 --> 09:31.398
Why don't you show her up

09:31.399 --> 09:32.918
to the guest room

09:29.876 --> 09:32.918
so she can freshen up?

09:32.959 --> 09:34.626
- I don't think
- that's necessary.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.959
(SNIFFS) I do.

09:39.918 --> 09:42.751
I do not smell anything.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.834
Except a stinking lie!

09:46.626 --> 09:48.480
Are you guys

09:48.481 --> 09:50.334
rehearsing some

09:46.626 --> 09:50.334
weird play I don't know about?

09:50.375 --> 09:51.959
Look, I don't want

09:51.960 --> 09:53.542
Darla to know

09:50.375 --> 09:53.542
I didn't get married,

09:53.584 --> 09:54.668
so I need you to

09:54.669 --> 09:55.751
pretend to be Brooks

09:53.584 --> 09:55.751
until she leaves.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.542
Please?

09:57.584 --> 09:58.709
Jessie, I don't know

09:58.710 --> 09:59.834
how to fake being

09:57.584 --> 09:59.834
a rich guy.

09:59.876 --> 10:02.000
- The last time I opened
- my wallet, a moth flew out!

10:03.083 --> 10:04.667
It's nothing you can't learn.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.188
And luckily

10:06.189 --> 10:07.667
for you, I know

10:04.709 --> 10:07.667
the perfect teacher.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.959
Welcome to Faking Wealth 101.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.647
In this class,

10:11.648 --> 10:13.292
you'll go from

10:10.000 --> 10:13.292
sad-sack to NASDAQ!

10:15.500 --> 10:16.861
- I have no idea
- what that means.

10:18.876 --> 10:19.876
It means

10:19.877 --> 10:20.876
we have a lot

10:18.876 --> 10:20.876
of work to do.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.000
- Jessie!
- Oh!

10:24.042 --> 10:25.042
Look at what

10:25.043 --> 10:26.042
Bertram and Zuri

10:24.042 --> 10:26.042
did to me!

10:26.083 --> 10:27.792
You could land

10:27.793 --> 10:29.500
a toy plane

10:26.083 --> 10:29.500
on my head!

10:29.542 --> 10:30.667
Great! Hours of fun

10:30.668 --> 10:31.792
for everyone.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.792
I'm busy here.

10:31.834 --> 10:33.834
What? What? But...

10:33.876 --> 10:35.375
Okay, fine.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.059
- You get started without me.
- I'll be right back.

10:37.083 --> 10:39.042
Come on!

10:39.083 --> 10:40.083
Is that the

10:40.084 --> 10:41.084
new rich guy hairdo?

10:41.125 --> 10:42.230
'Cause if so,

10:42.231 --> 10:43.334
that is a

10:41.125 --> 10:43.334
deal-breaker.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:54.083 --> 10:56.042
So, Jessie,

10:56.043 --> 10:58.000
your solution

10:54.083 --> 10:58.000
is tagging my head?

10:59.792 --> 11:00.835
I'm gonna be

11:00.836 --> 11:01.876
the laughing stock

10:59.792 --> 11:01.876
of the tenth grade.

11:01.918 --> 11:02.959
On the bright side,

11:02.960 --> 11:04.000
now Ravi will have

11:01.918 --> 11:04.000
someone to eat lunch with.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.000
Okay,

11:08.042 --> 11:09.251
Luke, you know,

11:09.252 --> 11:10.459
you're a man

11:08.042 --> 11:10.459
who shaves now,

11:10.500 --> 11:12.059
- so you can make
- your own decisions...

11:12.083 --> 11:13.876
Oh, I have. I'm gonna

11:13.877 --> 11:15.667
destroy Zuri and Bertram.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.731
Luke, please

11:16.732 --> 11:17.751
don't retaliate.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.042
Why not?

11:19.083 --> 11:21.000
- Because
- it's childish and petty.

11:22.584 --> 11:24.417
Now if you'll excuse me,

11:24.459 --> 11:26.899
- I have to go - make Darla eat her
- Rotten little heart out.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.396
Hey, we're going to dinner

11:30.397 --> 11:31.667
with Darla in an hour.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.042
So, how's it going?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.563
Whoa, Tony,

11:34.564 --> 11:36.042
you're really

11:33.083 --> 11:36.042
working up a sweat.

11:36.083 --> 11:38.042
It's not sweat.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.042
What's your name?

11:40.083 --> 11:41.542
Tony!

11:43.083 --> 11:45.063
No! For the tenth time,

11:45.064 --> 11:47.042
your name is Brooks!

11:47.083 --> 11:48.959
Hey, that's mean.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.522
He's doing his best.

11:50.523 --> 11:52.042
Hang on, let me try.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.063
Brooks, what

11:54.064 --> 11:56.042
is the most valuable

11:52.083 --> 11:56.042
painting in your collection?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.813
I don't know.

11:57.814 --> 11:59.542
Dogs Playing Poker?

12:06.792 --> 12:08.042
(BOTH SCREAMING)

12:08.083 --> 12:09.500
Stay away from us!

12:09.542 --> 12:10.710
I've got a spatula here,

12:10.711 --> 12:11.876
and I'm not afraid to use it.

12:12.876 --> 12:15.125
I just came in to watch TV.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.042
What's on?

12:17.083 --> 12:20.042
Coronary Country Cookin'.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.042
They're making squirrel

12:22.043 --> 12:24.000
sausage with

12:20.083 --> 12:24.000
a road kill reduction.

12:26.751 --> 12:28.167
You look great, Luke.

12:28.209 --> 12:29.667
That shirt really goes

12:29.668 --> 12:31.125
with your very

12:28.209 --> 12:31.125
life-like liquid hair.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.876
Oh.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.043
Uh, now, is that

12:34.044 --> 12:35.167
matte or semi-gloss?

12:37.167 --> 12:39.792
The TV is all yours, Luke.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.709
- You can watch
- anything you want.

12:41.751 --> 12:43.542
- Maybe you'd like
- a foot massage?

12:43.584 --> 12:44.959
Give him a foot massage!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.584
Why me?

12:46.626 --> 12:47.709
You're younger!

12:47.710 --> 12:48.792
You have more years

12:46.626 --> 12:48.792
to forget the horror!

12:48.834 --> 12:50.459
Well, you're older,

12:50.460 --> 12:52.083
so you have less time

12:48.834 --> 12:52.083
to be haunted by the memory!

12:54.626 --> 12:56.084
You know, my feet

12:56.085 --> 12:57.542
are a little tired.

12:57.584 --> 12:59.918
A massage sounds lovely.

13:01.751 --> 13:02.959
Mmm.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.167
Ew.

13:04.209 --> 13:06.022
Couldn't you have trimmed

13:06.023 --> 13:07.834
his toe hair while you

13:04.209 --> 13:07.834
had the razor out?

13:08.959 --> 13:10.813
I mean,

13:10.814 --> 13:12.667
you should be

13:08.959 --> 13:12.667
a foot model.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.709
Guys, relax.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.230
Jessie said I shouldn't

13:18.231 --> 13:19.709
retaliate against you,

13:16.751 --> 13:19.709
and she's right.

13:19.751 --> 13:20.897
So you mean

13:20.898 --> 13:22.042
you're not gonna

13:19.751 --> 13:22.042
get us back?

13:22.083 --> 13:23.522
No, of course not.

13:23.523 --> 13:24.959
I'm not a child.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.792
(SIGHS)

13:26.834 --> 13:28.125
You guys have a nice night.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.418
Luke isn't done

13:35.419 --> 13:36.709
with us yet.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.814
Revenge is a dish

13:38.815 --> 13:40.876
best served cold.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.397
You should know.

13:42.398 --> 13:43.876
All your dishes

13:40.918 --> 13:43.876
are served cold.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.459
I can see why Jessie

13:50.460 --> 13:51.834
likes this place.

13:51.876 --> 13:53.834
- She's partial
- to food in baskets,

13:53.876 --> 13:55.063
Being from a long line

13:55.064 --> 13:56.250
of carnival workers.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.292
Not a long line.

14:00.334 --> 14:03.042
One uncle.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.480
And he ran the most

14:04.481 --> 14:05.876
honest bean-bag

14:03.083 --> 14:05.876
toss on the midway.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.792
I, for one,

14:08.834 --> 14:09.980
am proud that our

14:09.981 --> 14:11.125
five kids will be

14:08.834 --> 14:11.125
part carny.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.667
Wow, five kids?

14:14.709 --> 14:16.376
Yeah. Teresa, Angela-Marie,

14:16.377 --> 14:18.042
Vinny, Carmella,

14:14.709 --> 14:18.042
and Tony Junior.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.438
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:19.439 --> 14:20.792
I mean, Brooks Junior.

14:20.834 --> 14:21.877
Yeah.

14:21.878 --> 14:22.918
The Fourth.

14:24.918 --> 14:26.064
Your free-range corndogs

14:26.065 --> 14:27.209
are almost ready.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.310
- While you're waiting,
- maybe Brooks could tell Darla

14:29.334 --> 14:30.605
Two or three

14:30.606 --> 14:31.876
fun things about

14:29.334 --> 14:31.876
his college days.

14:31.918 --> 14:32.939
Yeah, Brooks

14:32.940 --> 14:33.959
is a Harvard grad.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.522
Wow! I keep telling

14:35.523 --> 14:37.042
Jessie to get an education.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.834
I loved college.

14:38.876 --> 14:39.918
Flight attendant

14:39.919 --> 14:40.959
school is not college.

14:42.918 --> 14:43.959
Then why did I get

14:43.960 --> 14:45.000
a diploma, and

14:42.918 --> 14:45.000
tiny little wings?

14:46.125 --> 14:47.230
That's between you

14:47.231 --> 14:48.334
and Dustbowl Airlines.

14:50.417 --> 14:51.417
So, Brooks,

14:51.418 --> 14:52.418
did you like Harvard?

14:52.459 --> 14:53.751
Loved it. It was

14:53.752 --> 14:55.042
the best two years

14:52.459 --> 14:55.042
of my life.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.042
- Mmm-mmm. - One year?
- 18 months?

14:59.125 --> 15:01.042
He graduated early.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.563
Yeah, he's so smart

15:02.564 --> 15:04.042
that he didn't need

15:01.083 --> 15:04.042
all four years.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.042
Which, as everyone knows,

15:06.043 --> 15:08.000
is how long college takes.

15:10.959 --> 15:12.167
(CHUCKLES)

15:12.168 --> 15:13.375
Jessie, may I have

15:10.959 --> 15:13.375
a quick word?

15:13.417 --> 15:16.271
Excuse me. Oh, sweetie,

15:16.272 --> 15:19.125
while I'm gone, why don't you

15:13.417 --> 15:19.125
let Darla do all the talking?

15:21.083 --> 15:22.542
So, Jessie tells me

15:22.543 --> 15:24.000
you own an airline?

15:24.042 --> 15:25.730
I do?

15:25.731 --> 15:27.417
Boy, am I rich!

15:29.000 --> 15:30.876
- I really hope
- Tony doesn't mess this up.

15:30.918 --> 15:32.584
Speaking of mess-ups,

15:32.585 --> 15:34.250
if you wanted Tony to sound

15:30.918 --> 15:34.250
like a Harvard grad,

15:34.292 --> 15:35.585
you should not have asked

15:35.586 --> 15:36.876
Emma to coach him.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.876
Just tell Darla the truth.

15:46.918 --> 15:48.476
- What, that she's a banshee
- with a beverage cart?

15:48.500 --> 15:50.417
The middle seat of people?

15:50.459 --> 15:51.647
Oh, you mean about Brooks?

15:51.648 --> 15:52.834
No, not gonna happen.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.126
Jessie, you married

15:55.127 --> 15:56.167
the perfect guy!

15:56.209 --> 15:57.584
I love you both!

15:57.585 --> 15:58.959
I'll be right back.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
What? Ugh!

16:01.876 --> 16:03.188
(CHUCKLES) Okay!

16:03.189 --> 16:04.500
Whatever you said,

16:01.876 --> 16:04.500
you are a genius.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.500
You're the witch whisperer.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.313
Thanks! All I did is

16:08.314 --> 16:10.083
offer her a job at my airline.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.959
What? You can't do that!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.939
Yes, I can.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.876
I own the company!

16:17.918 --> 16:19.918
No, Brooks owns the company!

16:19.919 --> 16:21.918
You're not Brooks,

16:17.918 --> 16:21.918
you're Tony.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.064
Well, I wish you would

16:23.065 --> 16:24.167
make up your mind!

16:24.209 --> 16:26.042
- Where's a spray bottle
- when you need one?

16:30.375 --> 16:31.834
Thank you.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.168
Jessie, you don't seem

16:39.169 --> 16:41.834
very excited about

16:36.500 --> 16:41.834
my new job.

16:41.876 --> 16:42.876
Look, Darla,

16:42.877 --> 16:43.876
there's no easy way

16:41.876 --> 16:43.876
to say this,

16:44.500 --> 16:46.334
but Brooks is...

16:46.375 --> 16:48.126
A terrible boss.

16:48.127 --> 16:49.876
I can't let you work for him.

16:49.918 --> 16:51.564
What? But he seems

16:51.565 --> 16:53.209
like an absolute angel.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.918
Thank you, Darla.

16:55.959 --> 16:58.001
Well, he's not.

16:58.002 --> 17:00.042
He has a horrible memory,

16:55.959 --> 17:00.042
lousy taste in art,

17:00.083 --> 17:01.480
and cannot follow simple,

17:01.481 --> 17:02.876
clear instructions.

17:03.918 --> 17:05.250
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.396
Well, your step-sister

17:06.396 --> 17:07.500
can be very ungrateful,

17:07.541 --> 17:09.751
even when someone

17:09.752 --> 17:11.959
is doing her

17:07.541 --> 17:11.959
a huge, huge favor.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.500
- She's always
- been selfish.

17:13.541 --> 17:15.271
One time, she threw

17:15.272 --> 17:17.000
herself down a well

17:13.541 --> 17:17.000
just to get attention.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.064
Yes, who wouldn't

17:21.065 --> 17:22.584
want to be seen

17:19.541 --> 17:22.584
on national TV,

17:22.626 --> 17:23.813
fishing a leech out

17:23.814 --> 17:25.000
of their underpants?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.375
I just felt bad

17:28.376 --> 17:29.500
for that poor leech.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.500
Whoa! Whoa!

17:36.042 --> 17:38.335
Brooks, just tell

17:38.336 --> 17:40.626
Darla she can't

17:36.042 --> 17:40.626
work for you.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.542
How mean can you be?

17:42.584 --> 17:44.084
This from the girl

17:44.085 --> 17:45.584
who told me a hornet's

17:42.584 --> 17:45.584
nest was a pinata.

17:48.626 --> 17:50.293
Well, it was filled

17:50.294 --> 17:51.959
with lots of little

17:48.626 --> 17:51.959
surprises.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.042
- Brooks, I just hope you
- got a pre-nup,

17:56.083 --> 17:57.188
Because you could

17:57.189 --> 17:58.292
do a lot better.

17:58.334 --> 17:59.959
- You know what?
- That's it!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.022
Why am I still trying

18:01.023 --> 18:02.042
to impress you?

18:02.083 --> 18:03.605
Uh, all of our lives,

18:03.606 --> 18:05.125
I have been so worried

18:05.167 --> 18:06.626
what you think about me.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.292
- But why should
- I care what you think?

18:08.334 --> 18:09.501
I mean,

18:09.502 --> 18:10.667
you're mean and petty.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.542
- Cinderella had
- nicer step-sisters!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.226
- What are you
- babbling about?

18:16.250 --> 18:18.126
Okay, the truth is Brooks

18:18.127 --> 18:20.000
and I didn't get married.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
Finally!

18:25.083 --> 18:27.042
So, Brooks,

18:27.043 --> 18:29.000
does that mean

18:25.083 --> 18:29.000
you're available?

18:29.042 --> 18:30.918
- This isn't Brooks.
- This is Tony.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.042
Tony the doorman?

18:34.083 --> 18:35.209
So you've heard of me?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.563
So you made all of this up?

18:38.564 --> 18:40.042
What's going on here?

18:40.083 --> 18:41.313
Uh, I was engaged

18:41.314 --> 18:42.542
to a billionaire

18:40.083 --> 18:42.542
named Brooks,

18:42.584 --> 18:43.876
but I called it all off

18:43.877 --> 18:45.167
at the last minute.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.397
I didn't want to tell you,

18:46.398 --> 18:47.584
because even though

18:45.209 --> 18:47.584
I didn't get dumped,

18:47.626 --> 18:48.813
I knew you

18:48.814 --> 18:50.000
would still rub

18:47.626 --> 18:50.000
my nose in it.

18:50.042 --> 18:51.042
I don't rub

18:51.043 --> 18:52.043
your nose in things.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.647
Have I said one word

18:53.648 --> 18:55.209
about your pathetic

18:52.083 --> 18:55.209
excuse for an acting career?

18:55.250 --> 18:58.042
Uh, you just did.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.772
Well, you deserved it

18:59.773 --> 19:01.459
because you made me

18:58.083 --> 19:01.459
quit my job.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.751
Okay, actually, uh,

19:02.752 --> 19:04.000
I do feel really bad

19:01.500 --> 19:04.000
about that.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.584
Maybe you can get it back.

19:05.626 --> 19:07.813
Oh, I don't think so.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.000
Um, here's the text

19:05.626 --> 19:10.000
I sent my boss.

- Are you sure - you're not
- From Jersey?

19:20.626 --> 19:22.334

19:22.335 --> 19:24.042
I make this up to you?

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

19:25.335 --> 19:26.584
Well, you can start

19:24.083 --> 19:26.584
by giving me that watch.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.417
And that necklace.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.250
And those earrings.

19:31.292 --> 19:33.584
And your shoes.

19:33.626 --> 19:35.351
- Wha... Wait! But - we don't even have
- The same size feet!

19:35.375 --> 19:36.834
I know. I just need

19:36.835 --> 19:38.292
something huge

19:35.375 --> 19:38.292
to put all this stuff in.

19:43.542 --> 19:45.083
- Let this be
- a lesson to you, Ravi.

- Were dead.

- call someone?

right about not

retaliating.
