04:00.801 --> 04:02.302
What?

04:06.773 --> 04:08.742
You didn't flip
the lid down.

04:13.413 --> 04:15.847
No, you don't...
You don't have to.

[truck door slams]

04:40.940 --> 04:42.973
Why are you wearing
that hat today?

04:42.975 --> 04:44.675
You know it's going
to be 90 degrees.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.210
It's my work hat.

04:46.212 --> 04:48.245
Why do you think
you forget so much?

04:48.247 --> 04:50.680
Well, Donny, I don't know.

04:50.682 --> 04:52.182
I guess I'm just
a forgetful person.

04:52.184 --> 04:53.683
No, that's not it.

04:53.685 --> 04:55.119
I think you're
a careless person.

04:55.121 --> 04:56.686
It's more important
to get the job done

04:56.688 --> 04:58.788
than g-g-get the job
done right.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.324
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

05:00.326 --> 05:02.792
Human nature,
though.

05:02.794 --> 05:05.027
Getting the job done
the easy way

05:05.029 --> 05:06.396
is like running away
from the problem.

05:06.398 --> 05:08.764
Because dealing
with the problem is...

05:08.766 --> 05:10.399
It takes hard work.

05:10.401 --> 05:13.136
Is that something you just
learned about people?

05:13.138 --> 05:14.937
Is human nature the reason
you never shut up

05:14.939 --> 05:17.073
or mind your own
damn business?

05:17.075 --> 05:19.809
I'm dealing with the problem
by talking through the problem.

05:19.811 --> 05:21.010
That's all.

05:21.012 --> 05:23.412
[chuckles]

05:23.414 --> 05:25.448
What is this,
Pick on Donna Day?

- Hey, hey.

06:06.822 --> 06:08.789
You don't smell
so good.

06:08.791 --> 06:11.359
Well, I need a wash.
Ma, why ain't you in bed?

06:11.361 --> 06:12.960
I haven't been
sleeping nights.

06:12.962 --> 06:15.930
Figured I might as well
skip the afternoon naps.

06:15.932 --> 06:18.532
Fine, but you'll be
in more pain later.

06:18.534 --> 06:20.534
- No, I've felt good this week.
- [Donny] All right.

06:20.536 --> 06:22.836
I got to take a shower.
I'm going to go see Wendy.

06:22.838 --> 06:24.371
You want me to put you
in front of the TV?

06:24.373 --> 06:27.376
No, no. Give her a kiss
for me, though, yeah?

06:42.991 --> 06:45.894
- [man] Hey, Don!
- [woman] Donny!

07:21.563 --> 07:23.130
What do you want, Donny?

07:24.031 --> 07:25.197
[laughs]

07:25.199 --> 07:26.533
What do you think
I want?

[chuckles]

07:32.106 --> 07:34.475
[door opens and closes]

07:38.312 --> 07:41.380
She's playing in her room.
She doesn't want to see you.

07:41.382 --> 07:43.047
What, did you not tell her
I was coming?

07:43.049 --> 07:44.583
How was I supposed to know
you were coming?

07:44.585 --> 07:46.251
It's Tuesday, Linda,
frick's sake.

07:46.253 --> 07:48.221
- Is Randy here?
- No.

07:59.499 --> 08:00.965
How's he doing?

08:00.967 --> 08:02.869
He's fine.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.070
You can come on too,
if you want.

08:06.072 --> 08:08.005
I'm good.

08:08.007 --> 08:09.440
All right.

08:09.442 --> 08:11.142
I'm trying.

08:11.144 --> 08:12.410
You're what?

08:12.412 --> 08:13.943
I'm trying.

08:13.945 --> 08:16.148
Yeah, you're always trying,
Donny.

08:17.317 --> 08:19.049
She's been asking me
shit about us.

08:19.051 --> 08:22.420
She asked me if we used
to be married.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.921
Wonder where she got that idea.
Is that what you're telling her?

08:24.923 --> 08:26.289
No, that's...
That's not what I meant.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.024
No, nothing ain't ever
what you meant.

08:28.026 --> 08:29.526
- Daddy, you're here!
- Hey. Hey, sweets.

08:29.528 --> 08:30.994
What are you doing here?

08:30.996 --> 08:32.361
Mom said you weren't
coming today.

08:32.364 --> 08:34.130
- Oh, did she?
- I want to show you some stuff.

08:34.131 --> 08:35.567
Come here, come here.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.501
- [door closes]
- Hey, come look.

08:38.503 --> 08:40.102
I got the complete set now.

08:40.105 --> 08:41.304
[Donny]
Oh, really?

08:41.306 --> 08:43.173
- Yeah.
- You got Big Ben?

08:43.174 --> 08:45.508
Yeah, I got Big Ben.
All of them.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.177
All of them?
What you mean, all of them?

08:47.179 --> 08:49.912
Well, I mean,
I got the regular card,

08:49.914 --> 08:52.981
I got the Super Bowl card,
his All-Pro card.

08:52.983 --> 08:55.585
- You got his All-Pro card?
- Oh, and check this out.

08:55.587 --> 08:57.654
What, did Mom
get you that?

08:57.656 --> 08:59.355
Oh, Randy got it for me.

08:59.357 --> 09:02.958
No, but look.
I posted this video yesterday.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.593
It's Big Ben in high school.

09:04.595 --> 09:06.929
Can you believe he was a wideout
back then?

09:06.931 --> 09:09.367
You're on social media now?

09:10.267 --> 09:12.334
Dad, I'm 11.

09:12.336 --> 09:14.038
Thirteen on here.

09:15.072 --> 09:17.139
I ain't even on
social media.

09:17.141 --> 09:19.443
Well, you ain't even
got any friends.

09:22.246 --> 09:24.415
Who said I got
no friends?

09:25.516 --> 09:27.050
Randy.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.019
Well, he probably got
no friends.

09:32.021 --> 09:33.287
Who the fuck...

09:33.289 --> 09:35.123
Who the hell
are his friends?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.258
A bunch of them come over
a few nights a week,

09:37.260 --> 09:40.261
and they drink beers
and play poker...

09:40.263 --> 09:41.596
Wait, go back, go back.

09:41.598 --> 09:43.531
Who's that?

09:43.533 --> 09:44.999
Oh.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.201
Justin Ziegler.

09:47.203 --> 09:49.604
- He's full of shit.
- Don't say...

09:49.606 --> 09:52.105
Don't say "shit".

09:52.107 --> 09:53.307
I know Justin.

09:53.309 --> 09:55.208
His family's on my route.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.412
- So?
- So, what's the brother called?

09:57.414 --> 09:59.079
Tyler?

09:59.081 --> 10:00.581
I think.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.016
- [Donny] Tyler, right?
- [Wendy] Yeah, Tyler.

10:03.018 --> 10:04.619
- That's his name.
- Ask him what's going on.

10:04.621 --> 10:06.253
Oh, no, thank you.

10:06.255 --> 10:08.422
No, he waves at me every morning
from his window.

10:08.424 --> 10:10.758
He wasn't there this morning.
Just ask him what's going on.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.026
Dad, don't embarrass me.

10:13.028 --> 10:15.097
Nothing ever happens
around here.

10:17.232 --> 10:19.967
Well, what if...
What if it was you?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.306
Randy get you them flags
and that?

10:26.308 --> 10:27.507
[Wendy]
Yeah.

10:27.509 --> 10:29.311
But he don't like hockey.

10:30.512 --> 10:32.077
He don't like hockey?

10:32.079 --> 10:33.412
What, is he...

10:33.414 --> 10:35.114
some kind of weirdo?

10:35.116 --> 10:36.616
[both laugh]

10:36.618 --> 10:39.385
Hey, you want to go skating
in Cranberry this weekend?

10:39.387 --> 10:41.053
- Get out of the heat?
- Yeah.

10:41.055 --> 10:42.523
Yeah? All right.

[Wendy, over phone]
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

12:30.261 --> 12:33.162
- [Donny] Sorry.
- <i>School's tough as it is, Dad.</i>

12:33.164 --> 12:35.565
<i>Justin's an idiot,</i>

12:35.567 --> 12:37.165
<i>and it's like social suicide.</i>

12:37.167 --> 12:38.834
Everyone thinks
you got a creepy father.

12:38.836 --> 12:40.736
They think I have
two fathers.

12:40.738 --> 12:43.305
Well, you have one father,
Wendy, all right?

12:43.307 --> 12:44.774
One. Just me.

12:44.776 --> 12:46.542
<i>Not Randy. I'm your dad.</i>

12:46.544 --> 12:48.811
Did he... Did he say anything
about Tyler?

12:48.813 --> 12:50.880
<i>No, Dad,
can you just please</i>

12:50.882 --> 12:52.681
<i>stay out of that part
of my life?</i>

12:52.683 --> 12:54.649
Tyler's going to show up,
and then you can just

12:54.651 --> 12:56.553
forget about the whole thing,
all right?

12:57.454 --> 12:58.853
<i>All right?</i>

12:58.855 --> 13:00.488
All right.

13:00.490 --> 13:02.691
Hey. Hey, change your password.

13:02.693 --> 13:05.660
It was too easy
to break into your page.

13:05.662 --> 13:07.262

God, poor kid.

Do you ever just want
to jump aboard?

16:18.783 --> 16:20.551
See where it takes you?

16:21.485 --> 16:22.684
Hmm.

16:22.686 --> 16:25.356
Or jump in front.

17:12.068 --> 17:14.871
What the hell are you doing?
Donny?

17:39.527 --> 17:41.627
Hey, Mrs. Ziegler.

17:41.629 --> 17:43.999
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:47.002 --> 17:48.969
How are you holding up?

17:48.971 --> 17:51.806
Tyler used to wave at me,
you know.

18:01.482 --> 18:03.651
He didn't go exploring.

18:04.719 --> 18:07.553
No?

18:07.555 --> 18:09.755
Cops say he wandered off
into the woods somewhere.

18:09.757 --> 18:11.589
He didn't.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.193
Justin would do that.

18:14.195 --> 18:16.661
Not Tyler.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.831
He's scared of everything.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.868
Wouldn't even come
within 10 feet of the curb.

18:25.106 --> 18:27.174
Well, you think something
happened to him?

18:30.110 --> 18:32.145
It didn't have to happen.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.651
[door opens]

18:54.000 --> 18:55.699
What'd she say?

18:55.701 --> 18:57.868
He didn't go exploring.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.672
He wouldn't.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.564
That's terrible.

19:28.566 --> 19:31.000
Didn't you and your dad
used to play in the same crick?

19:31.002 --> 19:33.205
I don't know, Ma.
Probably.

19:36.908 --> 19:38.207
I'm going to go out now.

19:38.209 --> 19:39.709
You want me to put you
by the TV?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.913
No, no.
Where are you going?

19:43.214 --> 19:44.983
Just out.

20:01.732 --> 20:04.065
Egg whites and hash browns,
light on the onions?

20:04.067 --> 20:05.635
No, just a hot cocoa.

20:06.803 --> 20:08.105
It's like 100 degrees out.

20:09.206 --> 20:10.638
Can I ask you
a question?

20:10.640 --> 20:12.073
Chicken still ain't
free-range,

20:12.075 --> 20:13.575
and we don't use
Krispy Kreme's recipe

20:13.577 --> 20:15.844
- on the French toast.
- Not that.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.812
What do you want
to know, Donny?

20:17.814 --> 20:21.651
Have you seen
the Ziegler family recently?

20:24.221 --> 20:26.189
Not since last week, why?

20:29.893 --> 20:32.893
Because I don't...

20:32.895 --> 20:34.895
Anyone strange come in here
the past couple days?

20:34.897 --> 20:37.165
[woman chuckles]

20:37.167 --> 20:40.870
I ain't seen an unfamiliar face
in here in about three years.

20:45.174 --> 20:47.176
What's the matter with you?

20:52.681 --> 20:54.848
I got to get going.

20:54.850 --> 20:57.953
Thank you for your
cooperation.

20:59.288 --> 21:00.854
You want your hot cocoa to go?

21:00.856 --> 21:02.992
No, it's all right.

21:04.293 --> 21:06.126
But your eyes
back in your head, Jim.

21:06.128 --> 21:08.663
or I'll tell Nancy what
your pecker's been thinking.

21:11.733 --> 21:13.302
Thank you, Tara.

21:14.903 --> 21:16.805
[woman]
Thank you.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.274
What's going on, Donny?

21:21.276 --> 21:23.376
- Oh, hey.
- What you doing?

21:23.378 --> 21:25.778
I don't know.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.949
Yes, you do.

21:30.185 --> 21:31.884
Look, the Zieglers,

21:31.886 --> 21:35.221
they're grieving for Tyler,
and...

21:35.223 --> 21:37.789
and you're kind of drawing
attention to yourself.

21:37.791 --> 21:41.094
You know you're doing that,
right?

21:41.096 --> 21:43.331
Well, no, I was talking
to Mrs. Ziegler.

21:45.132 --> 21:47.265
You guys think
he just walked off?

21:47.267 --> 21:49.134
Donald, stop.

21:49.136 --> 21:52.037
The boy drowned.
That's all there is to it.

21:52.039 --> 21:54.673
Leave it to us, okay?

21:54.675 --> 21:56.308
Yeah?

21:56.310 --> 21:58.078
Let us handle it.

23:13.385 --> 23:16.188
[blues music playing

23:49.186 --> 23:50.952
Oh, hey, Max.

23:50.954 --> 23:52.287
How's it going?

23:52.289 --> 23:53.890
Not bad.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.894
What's up?
Is something bothering you?

23:59.896 --> 24:01.498
Maybe.

24:02.799 --> 24:05.366
How about you?

24:05.368 --> 24:07.001
[laughs]

24:07.003 --> 24:08.970
Don, man, what are you
talking about?

24:08.972 --> 24:10.438
The Ziegler kid.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.973
Huh?

24:11.975 --> 24:14.108
It's been three days.

24:14.110 --> 24:15.476
Yeah.

24:15.478 --> 24:18.212
Yeah, so why ain't you
investigating it?

24:18.214 --> 24:19.980
Because he drowned.

24:19.982 --> 24:21.915
He ain't the first kid
to drown in the creek.

24:21.917 --> 24:25.453
All right, just be straight with
me for a second, off the record.

24:25.455 --> 24:27.388
Off the record?
What are you, a reporter now?

24:27.390 --> 24:29.290
No, I'm still
in sanitation.

24:29.292 --> 24:30.524
[laughs]

24:30.526 --> 24:32.158
Yeah, I know you're in
sanitation.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.127
Yeah, okay, come on,
we know each other 25 years.

24:34.129 --> 24:35.395
Right?

24:35.397 --> 24:37.130
Uh... yeah.

24:37.132 --> 24:38.832
- Yeah? So?
- So?

24:38.834 --> 24:40.066
What's going on?

24:40.068 --> 24:41.534
There's nothing going on.

24:41.536 --> 24:43.270
The parents don't want
to press no charges...

24:43.272 --> 24:44.604
What's that got
to do with nothing?

24:44.606 --> 24:46.106
Because he drowned
on the property.

24:46.108 --> 24:47.440
No, his death.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.009
Why aren't you
investigating his death?

24:49.011 --> 24:50.310
Why are you asking me
about this?

24:50.312 --> 24:52.112
- It's bothering me.
- Why?

24:52.114 --> 24:54.114
Everyone's saying
he just wandered off.

24:54.116 --> 24:56.752
He didn't.
Mrs. Ziegler told me.

25:00.622 --> 25:02.087
[scoffs]

25:02.089 --> 25:04.023
All right, me and Pete...

25:04.025 --> 25:05.291
You know Pete, right?

25:05.293 --> 25:06.626
- Pete Stanford?
- Pete Stanford.

25:06.628 --> 25:08.861
We was prepping
an investigation,

25:08.863 --> 25:11.864
and we had these pictures
of the kid

25:11.866 --> 25:13.265
we were going to take
to the coroner.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.900
But Mooney comes in

25:14.902 --> 25:16.368
and he tells us not to go.

25:16.370 --> 25:18.003
Not to go to the coroner?

25:18.005 --> 25:19.605
Yeah.

25:19.607 --> 25:21.440
Then he took him from us,
and then he redirected us

25:21.442 --> 25:23.609
to some bullshit meth head
in Evans City.

25:23.611 --> 25:26.178
Man, every kid in that town
is fried.

25:26.180 --> 25:28.147
So, what's bothering you?
Mooney?

25:28.149 --> 25:29.581
No, I didn't say that.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.550
I didn't say nothing
was bothering me.

25:31.552 --> 25:33.652
It's just, I hadn't heard
nothing in a couple days,

25:33.654 --> 25:36.156
and that's it.

25:37.924 --> 25:39.625
So ain't the Zieglers
looking for answers?

25:39.627 --> 25:41.426
[inhales]

25:41.428 --> 25:44.395
I'm sure Sheriff Mooney's
got it all under control.

25:44.397 --> 25:45.963
Can I get you anything, Donny?

25:45.965 --> 25:47.565
No! Charlie, thank you.

25:47.567 --> 25:50.001
Maybe you ought to leave
Officer Himmler alone, yeah?

25:50.003 --> 25:52.236
- It's fine, Charlie.
- Fine, I'll get a beer.

25:52.238 --> 25:53.504
A Diet Coke.

25:53.506 --> 25:55.041
Diet Coke.

25:59.978 --> 26:01.245
Just take it easy.

26:01.247 --> 26:03.914
All right. I'm calm.

26:03.916 --> 26:06.584
- Can I ask you...
- That's enough.

26:06.586 --> 26:08.486
You want to have a beer
or you want to sit down?

26:08.488 --> 26:10.320
No.

26:10.322 --> 26:12.523
Thanks, Max.

26:12.525 --> 26:14.159
Yeah.

[country music playing

What the hell
are you looking for?

26:59.003 --> 27:00.536
Clues.

27:00.538 --> 27:02.638
What, like bloodstains
and that?

27:02.640 --> 27:04.473
[scoffs]

27:04.475 --> 27:06.575
You really think
they'd be stupid enough

27:06.577 --> 27:08.579
to throw their evidence
in the trash?

27:10.147 --> 27:12.648
What did you do
after work yesterday?

27:12.650 --> 27:14.048
Nothing.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.383
Nothing?

27:15.385 --> 27:17.352
Yeah, I didn't do nothing.

27:17.354 --> 27:20.522
I heard you was
in Murphy's Kitchen.

27:20.524 --> 27:22.123
So?

27:22.125 --> 27:24.526
So you was acting funny.

27:24.528 --> 27:27.397
I'm always acting funny.
I can't help that.

27:30.534 --> 27:32.066
Do the presidents thing.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.535
I can't do it
if I ain't nervous.

27:33.537 --> 27:35.336
If I ain't nervous
I got to think about it.

27:35.338 --> 27:37.305
I never get the VP names
if I got to think about it.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.440
Oh, come on. Do it.

27:38.442 --> 27:40.210
No.

Well, I guess you was nervous
yesterday.

28:02.064 --> 28:03.566
Can we go!

with you?

you think you're going?

about the dead kid and that.

- He drowned.

No.

at your house?

He was sometimes.

36:03.530 --> 36:05.099
He was? Why?

36:22.616 --> 36:24.716
Her friends told me to tell you
they broke into her page.

36:24.718 --> 36:27.585
They were just messing about.
They didn't mean nothing by it.

36:27.587 --> 36:30.521
Who the fuck
is Wendy Connolly?

36:30.523 --> 36:32.558
- [kids snicker]
- [fly buzzes]

36:35.228 --> 36:38.595
[Donna] So the kid didn't
have any health problems?

36:38.597 --> 36:40.131
His brother says not.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.533
But that little punk's
got the IQ of a spoon,

36:42.535 --> 36:43.867
so I don't know.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.271
Kids today,
they're getting dumber.

36:46.273 --> 36:47.805
Except Wendy.

36:47.807 --> 36:49.307
So, what was he
doing there then?

36:49.309 --> 36:51.709
He was there for Patty.
I just told you that.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.177
Patty's, like, 45.

36:53.179 --> 36:54.678
So?

36:54.680 --> 36:57.548
So pediatricians
treat kids, not adults.

36:57.550 --> 36:58.782
What, he can't
treat Patty too?

36:58.784 --> 37:00.184
[laughs]

37:00.186 --> 37:02.152
Donny, maybe she was
sleeping with Pomorowski.

37:02.154 --> 37:03.721
Huh?

37:03.723 --> 37:05.055
What's that mean?

37:05.057 --> 37:07.093
They were banging.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.863
[truck door closes]

37:16.701 --> 37:17.934
Huh?

37:17.936 --> 37:20.003
Hm. You're so cute.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.338
The phone calls.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.776
Like, he's always
at their house and shit.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.612
He's a doctor.
He can't do that.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.246
You think he's above that

37:30.248 --> 37:32.315
because of what he does
for a living?

37:32.317 --> 37:33.885
I don't think...

37:35.186 --> 37:36.721
What?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.827
What is it?

37:45.829 --> 37:47.531
What does it say?

37:48.699 --> 37:50.135
Hmm?

38:46.189 --> 38:48.723
You going to tell me
what you're thinking?

39:09.277 --> 39:10.777
[Donny]
Pull over here.

39:10.779 --> 39:12.180
I'll walk the rest.

39:27.295 --> 39:28.727
All right.

39:28.729 --> 39:29.995
I'll be here.

39:29.997 --> 39:32.097
I thought that was
your work hat.

39:32.099 --> 39:33.634
It is.

40:18.912 --> 40:21.713
Hey, you left a note
on my truck?

40:28.354 --> 40:30.256
Aah!

40:42.134 --> 40:43.767
What do you want?

40:43.769 --> 40:45.971
We know you fucking did it.
Now, jump.

40:50.108 --> 40:52.144
[train horn blaring]

40:53.412 --> 40:55.113
Aah! No!

40:59.284 --> 41:01.119
[groans]

41:05.257 --> 41:07.326
[train rumbling]

41:10.094 --> 41:11.430
Aah!

41:13.798 --> 41:15.132
Aah!

41:17.468 --> 41:19.101
[screaming]

41:19.103 --> 41:20.805
Stop!

41:27.211 --> 41:29.213
[train rumbling]

41:52.168 --> 41:55.071
Shit, Donny,
are you okay?

42:00.577 --> 42:03.044
McKinley/Hobart.

42:03.046 --> 42:06.116
Cleveland/Stevenson.

42:07.883 --> 42:09.284
Harrison/Morton.

42:09.286 --> 42:11.887
Cleveland/Hendricks.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.524
Arthur/Garfield.

42:16.526 --> 42:18.292
Hayes/Wheeler.

42:18.294 --> 42:19.993
I don't want
to do this no more.

42:19.995 --> 42:22.530
We got to take this
to the cops.

42:22.532 --> 42:25.267
Mc... McKinley/Hobart.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.203
<i>Cleveland/Stevenson.</i>

42:33.909 --> 42:35.309
- Hey.
- What the fuck?

42:35.311 --> 42:36.643
Did you send them
after me?

42:36.645 --> 42:38.512
Send who?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.514
What's going on, Max?
Everyone's saying I did it.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.249
I'm being set up, right?

42:42.251 --> 42:43.650
Huh?

42:43.652 --> 42:45.619
- Shit, Donny.
- Ain't gonna kill me, you know.

42:45.621 --> 42:48.355
What's going on?
I could be dead.

42:48.357 --> 42:50.289
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

42:50.291 --> 42:52.592
Oh, no? Two guys tried
to make me jump off the bridge,

42:52.594 --> 42:54.460
and one of them had a gun,
but he didn't shoot it

42:54.462 --> 42:56.462
because he wanted to make it
look like an accident.

42:56.464 --> 42:59.165
Something's going on.

42:59.167 --> 43:02.001
- Something's going on!
- Okay, shh!

43:02.003 --> 43:04.337
I know something's
going on, okay?

43:04.339 --> 43:06.439
You don't got
to tell me that.

43:06.441 --> 43:08.107
- [coughing and sobbing]
- Donny, shut up.

43:08.109 --> 43:10.211
You're going to wake up
my fucking kids.

43:11.512 --> 43:13.548
[sighs]

43:16.551 --> 43:18.917
Jesus, Donny.

43:18.919 --> 43:20.987
Why didn't you just
drop it?

43:22.490 --> 43:24.991
Ain't you got a little girl,
Donny? Ain't that enough?

43:27.461 --> 43:28.995
No.

43:32.265 --> 43:33.932
What are you
trying to do?

43:33.934 --> 43:36.067
Are you trying to give
your shitty life some meaning?

43:36.069 --> 43:38.004
Is that it?

43:40.474 --> 43:42.542
He was an innocent
little kid.

43:45.045 --> 43:46.613
And no one gives a shit.

43:53.387 --> 43:55.121
You know...

44:06.432 --> 44:08.167
You remember Bill Frankel?

44:10.636 --> 44:12.202
From high school?

44:12.204 --> 44:14.471
He works over
at the coroner's lab.

44:14.473 --> 44:16.540
In Harburg?

44:16.542 --> 44:18.910
No, not here.
In Pittsburgh.

44:21.414 --> 44:23.012
What are you... What...

44:23.014 --> 44:24.415
What are you asking me to do?

44:24.417 --> 44:26.182
I'm not asking you
to do anything, Donny.

44:26.184 --> 44:28.286
I'm just telling you
that you need evidence.

44:29.422 --> 44:30.987
And with a dead kid,

44:30.989 --> 44:33.559
there's almost always
abuse first.

44:35.761 --> 44:37.761
And I found out
that there was no autopsy.

44:37.763 --> 44:39.328
What kind of abuse?

44:39.330 --> 44:42.100
Why was there
no autopsy?

45:29.313 --> 45:32.146
Hello. Do you have
an appointment?

45:32.148 --> 45:34.381
No. My daughter's a patient.
I need to see Dr. Pomorowski.

45:34.383 --> 45:36.116
Oh, is it an urgent matter?

45:36.118 --> 45:37.686
Yeah, I'd say it's urgent.

45:37.688 --> 45:40.356
Sign in and have a seat.

45:55.238 --> 45:57.707
[child crying distantly]

46:08.818 --> 46:11.186
[crinkling]

46:22.664 --> 46:25.567
Sorry about the wait.
It's been a crazy day.

46:27.102 --> 46:29.101
I used to love the sound
this stuff made

46:29.103 --> 46:30.303
when I was a kid.

46:30.305 --> 46:32.305
So you were a patient?

46:32.307 --> 46:35.441
No, I stopped coming when my mom
couldn't afford the insurance.

46:35.443 --> 46:37.109
I think I'm overdue
a tetanus shot.

46:37.111 --> 46:38.511
[laughs]

46:38.513 --> 46:40.145
Well, we can certainly
arrange that.

46:40.147 --> 46:41.681
No.

46:41.683 --> 46:43.148
I don't like shots.

46:43.150 --> 46:45.319
Oh. Why don't you
have a seat.

46:49.123 --> 46:51.158
So, um...

46:52.226 --> 46:54.359
who is your daughter?

46:54.361 --> 46:57.195
Uh, Wendy Devlin Connolly.

46:57.197 --> 46:58.664
Wendy Connolly.

46:58.666 --> 47:00.332
Should be Devlin.

47:00.334 --> 47:01.833
All right, and what seems
to be the problem?

47:01.835 --> 47:03.569
I ain't here for her.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.372
So you do want
a tetanus shot.

47:07.474 --> 47:10.109
Were you the attending physician
for Tyler Ziegler?

47:11.311 --> 47:12.678
Mr. Devlin,
I can't give out

47:12.680 --> 47:14.312
private information
about my patients.

47:14.314 --> 47:16.247
So you are?

47:16.249 --> 47:19.517
Again, how are you related
to the Ziegler family?

47:19.519 --> 47:21.588
Were you sleeping
with his mother?

47:23.389 --> 47:24.722
I seen the phone records.

47:24.724 --> 47:27.658
Just tell me. I don't care.
Just...

47:27.660 --> 47:29.627
your wife won't know.

47:29.629 --> 47:31.464
Nobody will ever know.

47:35.301 --> 47:37.537
Why didn't you call
for an autopsy?

47:38.805 --> 47:40.540
Because he drowned.

47:41.774 --> 47:43.841
He have any medical
conditions?

47:43.843 --> 47:46.376
No. Healthy people
can still drown.

47:46.378 --> 47:47.678
Did you tell the police that?

47:47.680 --> 47:49.346
Of course I told
the police that.

47:49.348 --> 47:50.648
Was he abused?

47:50.650 --> 47:52.215
[sighs]

47:52.217 --> 47:53.685
Abused?

47:56.355 --> 47:58.223
That's what I asked you.

48:00.525 --> 48:02.292
Mr. Devlin,

48:02.294 --> 48:05.528
his lungs were filled
with creek water, all right?

48:05.530 --> 48:08.231
He wandered off
and he drowned.

48:08.233 --> 48:10.667
That's what the mother said
and that's what the police said.

48:10.669 --> 48:12.435
That's not what
his mother said.

48:12.437 --> 48:14.804
Mr. Devlin, if there was more
I could have done,

48:14.806 --> 48:16.439
I would have done it.

48:16.441 --> 48:19.676
Why wasn't there
an autopsy?

48:19.678 --> 48:21.543
Because Patty
didn't want one.

48:21.545 --> 48:23.646
Why didn't Patty
want an autopsy?

48:23.648 --> 48:25.381
Huh?

48:25.383 --> 48:29.385
Huh? Why didn't she want
an autopsy?

48:29.387 --> 48:30.619
Huh?

48:30.621 --> 48:32.388
Why didn't she...?

48:32.390 --> 48:34.823
Because she had some suspicions
about Jerry, all right?

48:34.825 --> 48:37.226
And frankly, I don't think
even she wanted to know.

48:37.228 --> 48:38.460
Jerry?

48:38.462 --> 48:40.262
Yes. The father.

48:40.264 --> 48:42.264
Mr. Devlin, look,

48:42.266 --> 48:44.232
I've been married 31 years

48:44.234 --> 48:46.669
and I've had this practice
for 26.

48:46.671 --> 48:49.404
I inherited it from my father.
He inherited it from his.

48:49.406 --> 48:51.609
I'd kind of like
to keep it.

48:52.910 --> 48:55.245
My father's dead.

49:07.657 --> 49:09.592
[door opens]

50:08.716 --> 50:11.619
- [dog barking]
- [engine revving]

50:13.721 --> 50:15.688
Did you do it, Jerry?

50:15.690 --> 50:17.389
Did you do it?

50:17.391 --> 50:19.625
Are you freaking crazy?
You out of your mind?

50:19.627 --> 50:21.560
- Do what?
- [engine revving]

50:21.562 --> 50:23.629
What?

50:23.631 --> 50:25.265
Donny?

50:26.433 --> 50:28.033
Donny, stop it.
I'm calling the cops.

50:28.035 --> 50:29.902
Did you do it, Jerry?

50:29.904 --> 50:31.603
What are you doing?

50:31.605 --> 50:33.505
What are you saying?

50:33.507 --> 50:34.907
You think I hurt my kid?

50:34.909 --> 50:37.609
- [engine revs]
- Donny, I never hurt him.

50:37.611 --> 50:40.614
I never laid a finger on him.
Never!

50:43.017 --> 50:45.652
Did you send those men
after me?

50:46.720 --> 50:48.789
What? No. Stop!

50:52.526 --> 50:55.362
What, are you going
to run me over now?

52:01.926 --> 52:04.694
- [Donna] Maybe Jerry's lying.
- He ain't lying.

52:04.696 --> 52:06.030
How do you know that?

52:10.034 --> 52:12.569
Donny, you need to stop.

52:14.038 --> 52:16.172
Attacking people? I mean,
you're making yourself look...

52:16.174 --> 52:17.708
Fine!

52:20.044 --> 52:22.211
[sighs]

52:22.213 --> 52:23.947
Oh, God.

52:28.685 --> 52:30.721
- [thunder rumbling]
- [rain pattering]

52:46.736 --> 52:48.804
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

53:00.650 --> 53:03.653
I care for you, Donny.

53:10.793 --> 53:12.558
- Don't do that!
- What? Why? Why not?

53:12.560 --> 53:14.228
- Don't do that!
- Why?

53:14.230 --> 53:17.231
- Because I'm with someone else!
- Who? Linda?

53:17.233 --> 53:20.633
Jesus, don't you think if that
whore had any feelings for you...

53:20.635 --> 53:22.769
Don't you call her that!
Don't you dare call her that!

53:22.771 --> 53:24.904
- We're going to get married!
- Oh, you're getting married?

53:24.906 --> 53:26.706
- Yeah, we got a kid!
- So?

53:26.708 --> 53:28.541
So you don't know what it's like
to have a kid.

53:28.543 --> 53:30.011
You gave your kid away.

53:34.149 --> 53:37.283
Is that what you think I did,
Donny?

53:37.285 --> 53:38.987
Is that what you think?

53:40.021 --> 53:41.556
Is it?

53:44.025 --> 53:47.594
"Donald and Donna"
don't sound right!

53:50.664 --> 53:53.232
They're going to fire you
if you miss another day.

53:53.234 --> 53:55.534
I ain't helping you
with this shit no more.

53:55.536 --> 53:58.770
You know what? You don't know
everything you think you know.

53:58.772 --> 54:00.075
Okay?

54:14.088 --> 54:15.956
[muffled voices humming]

54:33.240 --> 54:35.806
I just got off, Donny.

54:35.808 --> 54:38.278
I know, I know, I know.
I got to talk to you.

54:42.215 --> 54:43.748
I want to know
if you still think

54:43.750 --> 54:45.583
there's a chance
for you and me...

54:45.585 --> 54:46.919
and Wendy.

54:48.588 --> 54:52.156
There was never a chance
for you and me, Donny.

54:52.158 --> 54:53.991
Well, there was.

54:53.993 --> 54:55.893
One time, there was.

54:55.895 --> 54:58.695
Come on,
we're both Irish.

54:58.697 --> 55:00.031
Both like the Steelers.

55:00.033 --> 55:01.664
Are you serious,
Donny?

55:01.666 --> 55:03.702
You're really going
to make me say this again?

55:04.836 --> 55:07.137
I barely knew you.
And we was drunk.

55:07.139 --> 55:08.972
- I wasn't drunk.
- Bullshit.

55:08.974 --> 55:11.674
I wasn't drunk. I can't drink!
My dad died of drink!

55:11.676 --> 55:13.309
- I can't drink.
- Shh!

55:13.311 --> 55:15.245
I told you that.

55:15.247 --> 55:17.280
[sighs]

55:17.282 --> 55:20.250
I don't want to talk to you
about this anymore, Donny.

55:20.252 --> 55:22.986
No, I've been faithful to you.
I haven't been with nobody...

55:22.988 --> 55:26.122
You sound like a psycho
when you say things like that.

55:26.124 --> 55:28.291
We was never together.

55:28.293 --> 55:30.859
I know you tell people
that we was, but we wasn't.

55:30.861 --> 55:32.328
Ever.

55:32.330 --> 55:34.099
It's embarrassing
when that gets back to me.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.068
- Why is it embarrassing?
- Oh...

55:39.103 --> 55:40.905
[sighs]

55:41.972 --> 55:44.642
Why is it embarrassing?

55:46.110 --> 55:48.279
Don't make me say it.

55:52.083 --> 55:54.819
You think I don't hate
the way I am?

55:57.188 --> 55:59.689
You think I don't know
what people think of me?

56:02.826 --> 56:04.193
[sighs]

56:04.195 --> 56:06.328
I don't think you ever know
what people think.

56:06.330 --> 56:08.832
Well, I know our daughter
loves me.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.803
You know why
she's named Wendy?

56:15.004 --> 56:16.771
She's named
after my aunt.

56:16.773 --> 56:18.141
No.

56:19.976 --> 56:21.676
It's from Peter Pan.

56:21.678 --> 56:23.079
What?

56:27.183 --> 56:29.117
You and me and Wendy...

56:29.119 --> 56:31.187
in Neverland.

56:33.789 --> 56:35.158
Come on.

56:37.893 --> 56:39.761
- She deserves...
- Don't.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.870
Wendy didn't stay
in Neverland, Donny.

56:50.973 --> 56:52.674
She went the fuck home.

56:56.044 --> 56:57.779
[scoffs]

57:00.949 --> 57:02.749
[pats car]

57:02.751 --> 57:04.086
All right.

57:27.975 --> 57:30.111
[Max]
<i>You need evidence.</i>

57:31.879 --> 57:33.347
<i>You remember Bill?</i>

57:35.283 --> 57:37.652
<i>Coroner up in Pittsburgh.</i>

57:51.865 --> 57:53.865
[mother] Where are you going
at this hour?

57:53.867 --> 57:55.066
Ma, why are you still awake?

57:55.068 --> 57:57.168
Can't sleep.

57:57.170 --> 57:58.937
Ma, I got to go,
all right?

57:58.939 --> 58:01.039
All right.
God will protect you.

58:01.041 --> 58:02.941
He won't give you more
than you can handle.

58:02.943 --> 58:04.477
What does that mean?

58:05.812 --> 58:08.048
It's in the Bible.

58:16.089 --> 58:17.923
Go to bed, Ma.

59:26.857 --> 59:28.493
Oh, hey! Bill!

59:30.193 --> 59:32.093
Hey, it's...
It's Donald Devlin.

59:32.095 --> 59:36.064
From... I was a year
ahead of you in high school.

59:36.066 --> 59:37.566
- Hey, Devlin. Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:37.568 --> 59:39.501
I dated Linda Connolly.

59:39.503 --> 59:42.037
Max Himmler asked me
to come down and see you.

59:42.039 --> 59:43.571
He wanted to know
if you could help us.

59:43.573 --> 59:44.973
Help you with what?

59:44.975 --> 59:46.474
Well, you look
at the bodies, right?

59:46.476 --> 59:48.043
Like a coroner?

59:48.045 --> 59:50.945
Um... forensic evidence
specialist.

59:50.947 --> 59:52.247
Right. Like a scientist.

59:52.249 --> 59:53.947
[laughs]
Scientist. Yeah, sure.

59:53.949 --> 59:55.317
- That's what I am.
- Good.

59:55.319 --> 59:57.519
He needs you to take a look
at something.

59:57.521 --> 59:59.421
Why didn't Max
just come down himself?

59:59.423 --> 01:00:02.156
Oh, he's meeting with the
forensics guys back in Harburg.

01:00:02.158 --> 01:00:04.060
He wanted me to come down.

01:00:05.027 --> 01:00:06.360
You a cop too?

01:00:06.362 --> 01:00:08.630
Investigator.

01:00:08.632 --> 01:00:10.931
What do you want, Donald?

01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:12.366
I need you...

01:00:12.368 --> 01:00:14.368
I need you to just...

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.304
I just need you to tell me
if a dead kid was abused or not.

01:00:17.306 --> 01:00:20.407
I don't know.
I'd have to examine the body.

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.211
I'll show it to you.

01:00:27.316 --> 01:00:29.218
Where are we going?

01:00:37.693 --> 01:00:39.928
[Donny]
There's been no autopsy.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.132
Shit.

01:00:51.072 --> 01:00:52.874
Are you crazy?

01:00:54.509 --> 01:00:56.211
You can't fucking do this.

01:00:57.278 --> 01:01:00.281
[muffled voices]

01:01:13.394 --> 01:01:15.429
[phone line ringing]

01:01:17.364 --> 01:01:19.431
[Max, on phone] <i>Do you know
what you've done, Donny?</i>

01:01:19.433 --> 01:01:20.632
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

01:01:20.634 --> 01:01:24.071
<i>You went and dug the kid up!</i>

01:01:25.572 --> 01:01:27.305
<i>That's not what
I meant, Donny.</i>

01:01:27.307 --> 01:01:28.673
<i>This is a mess, Donny.</i>

01:01:28.675 --> 01:01:31.042
<i>I didn't tell you to do that.</i>

01:01:31.044 --> 01:01:34.981
<i>You fucked me on this, Donny.
Fucked us both!</i>

01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:57.970
Hey, Donny.

01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:01.207
Oh, hi.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:04.308
Come on, get in the car,
Mr. Devlin.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.177
I just got home.

01:02:06.179 --> 01:02:09.014
I got to make dinner
for my mom.

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:11.717
Get in the car.

01:03:10.207 --> 01:03:12.476
Heard you like to talk.

01:03:15.679 --> 01:03:18.047
You got nothing to say now?

01:03:19.249 --> 01:03:21.452
Don't you got
any questions for me?

01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:26.320
Okay, I'll start.

01:03:26.322 --> 01:03:28.556
You know how many homicides
happen on my watch

01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:29.825
in Harburg County?

01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:31.361
Hmm?

01:03:33.162 --> 01:03:35.565
None.

01:03:37.133 --> 01:03:38.735
How many accidents happen?

01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.602
Ah!

01:03:41.604 --> 01:03:43.706
[tires screech]

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.482
Anything else
on your mind?

01:03:56.819 --> 01:03:59.352
The boy drowned.
It's damn tragic.

01:03:59.354 --> 01:04:02.122
But it happens,
you understand?

01:04:02.124 --> 01:04:04.660
Do you understand?

01:04:05.727 --> 01:04:07.160
No.

01:04:07.162 --> 01:04:08.463
[tires screech]

01:04:20.275 --> 01:04:22.711
Can you not see
what you're doing?

01:04:24.913 --> 01:04:27.248
Can you not see
what you're doing?

01:04:28.684 --> 01:04:30.584
You ain't a smart man,
Donald.

01:04:30.586 --> 01:04:33.152
You're making it worse.

01:04:33.154 --> 01:04:36.388
I could charge you right now,
the way you've been acting.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.626
But I wouldn't hurt no one.

01:04:42.463 --> 01:04:45.299
But do you think
I could hurt someone?

01:04:55.443 --> 01:04:58.176
You let this go,

01:04:58.178 --> 01:05:02.115
and you let this go
right fucking now.

01:05:04.584 --> 01:05:06.386
Okay?

01:05:12.893 --> 01:05:15.228
Get out of my car.

01:05:31.578 --> 01:05:33.747
[tires squeal]

01:06:08.479 --> 01:06:10.248
McKinley/Hobart.

01:06:11.382 --> 01:06:13.184
Truman/Barkley.

01:06:14.352 --> 01:06:16.421
Carter/Mondale.

01:06:19.724 --> 01:06:22.260
[door opens]

01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:29.367
[mother]
Can't sleep.

01:06:30.034 --> 01:06:31.500
[Donny]
Take your pills.

01:06:31.502 --> 01:06:33.569
No.

01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:36.772
No, don't want to get dependent
on them.

01:06:36.774 --> 01:06:38.741
Ma, you're not going...

01:06:38.743 --> 01:06:41.777
you're not going
to get dependent.

01:06:41.779 --> 01:06:43.948
[mother]
I'm praying for you, son.

01:06:47.384 --> 01:06:48.719
Well, don't.

01:06:50.988 --> 01:06:52.921
You're a good boy, Donald.

01:06:52.923 --> 01:06:55.692
- No, I ain't.
- Yes, you are.

01:06:57.627 --> 01:07:00.895
The Bible says people's hearts
are good.

01:07:00.897 --> 01:07:03.431
Sometimes we do bad things,

01:07:03.433 --> 01:07:06.401
but no one's truly bad.

01:07:06.403 --> 01:07:09.070
"The heart is deceitful
above all things,

01:07:09.072 --> 01:07:10.939
"and desperately sick.

01:07:10.941 --> 01:07:12.743
Who can understand it?"

01:07:14.945 --> 01:07:17.246
That's what the Bible says, Ma.

01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:21.648
[mother]
I'd better go to bed.

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:25.554
Your dad'll be home soon.

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:53.939
[ignition turned off]

01:08:53.941 --> 01:08:56.076
[keys rattling]

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.865
What you doing?

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:23.602
I came looking for you.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.907
What happened
to your face?

01:09:32.044 --> 01:09:33.712
Nothing.

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:38.046
I called my mom today.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:42.118
We talked, and...

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.453
she brought up this thing
that happened in the town

01:09:44.456 --> 01:09:45.854
- when we were kids.
- You know what?

01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:47.523
I don't want to hear
about it, all right?

01:09:47.524 --> 01:09:49.559
- The kid drowned.
- You know he didn't drown.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.462
He did drown.

01:09:53.932 --> 01:09:56.598
I don't know if it's
the same thing or not,

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.467
but I looked it up
and I found this.

01:09:58.469 --> 01:10:00.136
No, I don't want
to see it.

01:10:00.138 --> 01:10:01.737
I think you should
talk to him.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.206
He's working in a garage
down in Duquesne.

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:05.041
The name and the address
is on there.

01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:06.378
Talk to him.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.583
[truck door opens]

01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:15.519
[truck door slams]

01:11:27.556 --> 01:11:28.922
Can I help you?

01:11:28.924 --> 01:11:30.290
Is George here?

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:32.560
What do you need him for?

01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:35.797
Is he here or not?

01:11:37.665 --> 01:11:39.631
Yeah, he's out back.

01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:41.103
Follow me.

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:53.045
See that car
out in the end?

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:54.682
He's under the hood.

01:12:15.369 --> 01:12:16.903
[Donny]
George?

01:12:22.075 --> 01:12:23.710
George Atzerodt?

01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:34.921
Is that about you?

01:12:40.226 --> 01:12:42.128
Did this guy hurt you?

01:12:52.938 --> 01:12:54.274
Yeah.

01:12:58.411 --> 01:13:00.612
Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:03.782 --> 01:13:05.751
[sniffles]

01:13:07.052 --> 01:13:08.652
It's all right.

01:13:08.654 --> 01:13:10.756
[sobs softly]

01:13:18.163 --> 01:13:19.831

[woman, on answering machine]
<i>Hello, no on here is available</i>

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:48.991
<i>to answer your call.</i>

01:13:48.993 --> 01:13:51.127
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

01:13:51.129 --> 01:13:52.228
[answering machine beeps]

[Max]
<i>Donny, it's Max.</i>

01:13:54.132 --> 01:13:56.898
<i>Flew up to the coroner's office
over in Pittsburgh.</i>

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.967
<i>They've opened up
an official inquest.</i>

01:13:58.969 --> 01:14:00.969
<i>This is premature,</i>

01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:05.041
<i>but Bill confirmed that they
did find evidence of abuse.</i>

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.444
<i>So I'm going to need you
to come down to the station.</i>

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:12.015
<i>Where the hell are you,
Donny?</i>

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.377
[shaky breathing]

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.183
I know you didn't
touch your son.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.786
I know you had nothing
to do with it.

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.337
Where's Mrs. Ziegler?

01:15:11.973 --> 01:15:15.376
She's upstairs.
She always is.

01:15:49.576 --> 01:15:51.378
Mrs. Ziegler?

01:15:52.446 --> 01:15:54.748
It's Donald Devlin.

01:15:59.019 --> 01:16:02.122
I found an abuse case
against Dr. Pomorowski.

01:16:05.259 --> 01:16:06.857
It's from years ago.

01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:11.329
Settled out of court.
Pittsburgh.

01:16:11.331 --> 01:16:14.668
I spoke with the victim this
afternoon down in Duquesne.

01:16:18.538 --> 01:16:20.506
He's not the only one.

01:16:24.076 --> 01:16:26.279
Was Pomorowski here that day?

01:16:29.148 --> 01:16:30.782
Mrs. Ziegler?

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:36.455
You need to take this
to the sheriff now.

01:16:38.023 --> 01:16:40.125
It won't make
no difference.

01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:44.961
Well, he's got to listen.

01:16:44.963 --> 01:16:46.965
It's evidence.

01:16:48.434 --> 01:16:50.634
I was going to stop it.

01:16:50.636 --> 01:16:54.105
Wait, what are you
talking about?

01:16:57.542 --> 01:16:59.511
I was going to stop it.

01:17:00.979 --> 01:17:03.181
I wasn't going to leave them
alone no more.

01:17:06.151 --> 01:17:08.919
You left Tyler alone
with Pomorowski?

01:17:10.121 --> 01:17:12.223
I thought he wanted me.

01:17:13.525 --> 01:17:15.427
Did you know
what he was doing?

01:17:17.495 --> 01:17:20.097
Did you know what he was doing
to Tyler the whole time?

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:23.365
I left Tyler alone with him
a couple of times

01:17:23.367 --> 01:17:25.000
while I ran errands,
that was all.

01:17:25.002 --> 01:17:27.204
And I was going to stop that,
I was.

01:17:28.238 --> 01:17:30.374
I love my son. I...

01:17:32.676 --> 01:17:34.378
I could go to prison.

01:17:36.947 --> 01:17:38.946
For what?

01:17:38.948 --> 01:17:40.649
Child neglect.

01:17:40.651 --> 01:17:44.053
Sheriff Moon...
Sheriff Mooney told me.

01:17:53.597 --> 01:17:56.199
Was Sheriff Mooney
doing it too?

01:17:58.167 --> 01:17:59.502
No.

01:18:03.573 --> 01:18:05.539
You don't know?

01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:08.578
They were friends
a long time!

01:18:09.612 --> 01:18:11.314
My baby.

01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:15.184
He-He...

01:18:16.386 --> 01:18:18.053
you did nothing?

01:18:20.556 --> 01:18:22.222
Tyler never said nothing.

01:18:22.224 --> 01:18:23.624
He never said nothing!

01:18:23.626 --> 01:18:26.460
He was quiet!
He was always quiet!

01:18:26.462 --> 01:18:29.064
He was quiet because he was
a shell of a boy...

01:18:29.732 --> 01:18:31.564
because...

01:18:31.566 --> 01:18:35.368
that man took something
away from him.

01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:38.039
Because you took something
away from him.

01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:41.209
I loved him.

01:18:44.212 --> 01:18:46.179
I didn't know.

01:18:46.181 --> 01:18:49.384
You just ignored it
because it was easier.

01:18:53.555 --> 01:18:56.357
[breathing heavily]

01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:08.302
[Donny]
He was just a little boy.

01:19:47.474 --> 01:19:50.141
[indistinct shouting]

01:19:50.143 --> 01:19:52.276
[Linda] Why do I have to come
home and clean up after you?

01:19:52.278 --> 01:19:53.744
What have you been
doing all day?

01:19:53.746 --> 01:19:55.646
Why don't you call
that retard, D-D-D-Donny?

01:19:55.648 --> 01:19:57.113
This has nothing
to do with him!

01:19:57.115 --> 01:19:58.449
Why are you bringing him
into this?

01:19:58.451 --> 01:19:59.817
Because he's
a fucking retard!

01:19:59.819 --> 01:20:02.120
[shouting indistinctly]

01:20:24.209 --> 01:20:25.408
Hey.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.644
- What happened?
- Huh?

01:20:27.646 --> 01:20:30.447
Oh... nothing.

01:20:30.449 --> 01:20:31.781
What you doing?

01:20:31.783 --> 01:20:33.617
Homework?

01:20:33.619 --> 01:20:35.819
Boring.

01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:37.587
[laughs]

01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:39.522
What you doing?

01:20:39.524 --> 01:20:42.694
Just came by
to pick something up.

01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:51.534
They're at it again.

01:20:51.536 --> 01:20:53.170
Yeah.

01:20:55.406 --> 01:20:56.705
What you think of Randy?

01:20:56.707 --> 01:20:58.576
He's okay, I guess.

01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:01.612
I mean, he ain't my dad.

01:21:02.847 --> 01:21:04.649
Nope.

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:14.792
You don't have
to be scared of him.

01:21:19.362 --> 01:21:21.763
<i>You don't have
to be scared of anything.</i>

01:21:21.765 --> 01:21:23.466
I know.

01:21:30.407 --> 01:21:32.074
[Donny]
<i>Hey.</i>

01:21:36.278 --> 01:21:38.381
I love you, sweets.

01:21:41.551 --> 01:21:43.285
I know.

01:22:24.827 --> 01:22:27.228
[car door closes]

01:22:40.942 --> 01:22:42.443
[fires]

01:23:15.509 --> 01:23:17.243
[rattles gate]

01:23:32.658 --> 01:23:34.927
[whimpering]
