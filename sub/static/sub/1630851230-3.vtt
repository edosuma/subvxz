The car was found abandoned
in a shopping mall parking lot

10:56.355 --> 10:58.391
twenty miles from where
the body was dumped.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.092
Security cameras
catch anything?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.193
- Nothing. They were busted.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.762
- What about forensics?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.764
- Weaver's DNA was found
all over the trunk.

it's a different story.

What have we got here?

Judge Weaver's side hustle.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.816
- What do you mean?

11:23.883 --> 11:26.152
- I think Weaver's
zero tolerance policy

11:26.218 --> 11:27.753
was more than
a judicial philosophy.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.388
I think he was
making money off it.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.756
- He was on the take?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.191
- I'm connecting
some dots here,

11:32.258 --> 11:33.826
but there are unexplained,
routine deposits

11:33.893 --> 11:36.228
into his account over
the course of seven years

11:36.295 --> 11:38.898
totaling over $2 million.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.400
- From who?
- Can't be certain.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.702
I've turned all this over
to the Public Corruption Squad.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.104
- And?

11:45.171 --> 11:46.772
- [sighs]
I have a theory.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.441
- Which is?

11:48.507 --> 11:50.276
- Weaver turned into
a zero tolerance judge

11:50.342 --> 11:52.878
around the same time
the deposits started.

11:52.945 --> 11:56.782
- So his judicial philosophy
was based on kickbacks.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.751
- Maybe, but when
the deposits started,

11:58.818 --> 11:59.952
When the deposits started,
two things changed.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.922
First, he started
sentencing every kid

12:02.988 --> 12:04.256
to a period of incarceration.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.357
- He didn't do that before?

12:05.424 --> 12:07.893
- No--he was always
a hanging judge,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.061
but not like this.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.396
And the second thing
that changed?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.231
- Instead of sending kids
to the, you know,

12:12.298 --> 12:13.866
the county-run
juvenile detention center,

12:13.933 --> 12:15.935
he started sending them
to these for-profit,

12:16.001 --> 12:18.938
"therapeutic boarding schools"
with contracts from the state.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.272
Some of them as far away
as North Carolina.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.177
- Weaver was trading
kids for cash.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.079
- Yeah, that's what
it looks like.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.181

wanted him dead.

your whiny, manipulative crap.

can be shamed,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.928

a hopeless psychopath.

reading "Soul Crusher"

13:46.158 --> 13:48.227

13:48.294 --> 13:50.462
- What's the nexus
between her and Judge Weaver?

13:50.529 --> 13:52.898

in rural West Virginia

13:52.965 --> 13:54.533
called Beech Mountain Academy.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.168
- So Weaver sent
a bunch of kids

- He did.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.872
