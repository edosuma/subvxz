WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.335
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:02.368 --> 00:03.637
Oh, gee.
BARKER: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.505
Bobby.

00:04.538 --> 00:05.672
Oh, my God. Sarah?

00:05.705 --> 00:06.807
How are you?

00:06.840 --> 00:07.774
I'm great.

00:07.808 --> 00:08.709
We did 10 minutes

00:08.742 --> 00:09.876
on my lousy marriage,

00:09.910 --> 00:11.011
20 minutes
on how your wife

00:11.044 --> 00:12.679
really doesn't
understand you.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.247
Bobby, this is foreplay.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.783
I have no plans
for being unfaithful

00:16.817 --> 00:17.818
to my--
BARKER: Yes, you do.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.585
You're probably
too good of a guy

00:18.619 --> 00:19.553
to actually do it,

00:19.586 --> 00:20.486
but just allowing

00:20.521 --> 00:21.555
for the possibility.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.488
DONNELL:
I'm having dinner

00:22.523 --> 00:25.458
with an old friend,
period.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.360
BARKER: If you're
ever single again, call me.

00:27.393 --> 00:29.630
I don't have plans
to be single again.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.732
Good night, Bobby.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.469
WASHINGTON: Why were you
having dinner with her?

00:36.503 --> 00:38.271
DONNELL: You all say
I crave isolation.

00:38.304 --> 00:39.606
WASHINGTON:
Don't give me that crap.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.341
You're looking to clear
your little conscience

00:41.374 --> 00:42.308
and not get caught.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.309
You said that in starting

00:43.343 --> 00:44.377
your own firm,

00:44.410 --> 00:46.112
you were beginning
a process

00:46.146 --> 00:47.147
of leaving me.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.982
Where are you
in that process?

00:49.015 --> 00:51.484
I so desperately
want us to make it.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.218
BARKER: I agree.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.386
It's best we stop now

00:53.419 --> 00:54.955
before it does get
too dangerous.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.189
Bye.

01:12.613 --> 01:13.313
Hey.

01:13.346 --> 01:15.381
Hey.

01:15.415 --> 01:16.316
Late night?

01:16.349 --> 01:19.285
Catching up on stuff.

01:19.319 --> 01:22.155
I called earlier,
got the machine.

01:22.188 --> 01:23.023
Were you out?

01:23.056 --> 01:24.457
No.

01:26.292 --> 01:27.060
You okay?

01:27.093 --> 01:30.430
(groans) Lousy day.

01:30.463 --> 01:31.832
What happened?

01:31.865 --> 01:32.666
It's boring.

01:32.699 --> 01:33.900
You don't want to know.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.001
Well, maybe I can help.

01:35.035 --> 01:35.769
Tell me.

01:36.703 --> 01:37.871
Okay.

01:37.904 --> 01:39.673
(sighs)

01:39.706 --> 01:41.842
It started out
Claire's soccer-ball case

01:41.875 --> 01:42.776
was stolen from us

01:42.809 --> 01:44.344
by a big product-liability firm,

01:44.377 --> 01:46.012
a firm which first refused
to take the case

01:46.046 --> 01:47.581
because they thought
it was untenable,

01:47.614 --> 01:48.615
but it's not untenable

01:48.649 --> 01:50.450
because we beat
summary judgment.

01:50.483 --> 01:52.185
The Mitchell Arbitration

01:52.218 --> 01:53.419
was postponed again,

01:53.453 --> 01:54.721
so I'm basically
funding that case

01:54.755 --> 01:56.189
until we reach settlement.

01:56.222 --> 01:58.992
My biggest client
just filed for Chapter 7.

01:59.025 --> 02:01.167
And there was one other thing.

02:01.201 --> 02:02.235
What was it?

02:03.036 --> 02:04.370
Oh, yeah.

02:04.404 --> 02:06.472
I saw you
kissing Sarah Barker

02:06.507 --> 02:08.108
outside an Italian restaurant.

02:09.576 --> 02:11.845
Oh, and, uh,

02:11.878 --> 02:13.580
my gun's been jamming.

02:13.614 --> 02:16.249
That's another thing.

02:16.282 --> 02:18.618
Given I do have a history,

02:18.652 --> 02:20.120
maybe you should hide
the bullets

02:20.153 --> 02:23.223
on those nights
you plan to commit adultery.

02:27.493 --> 02:28.662
(door slams)

02:30.163 --> 02:32.298
(music playing)

03:21.688 --> 03:23.323
We have to talk
about this.

03:23.356 --> 03:24.390
You're not looking
to talk.

03:24.424 --> 03:26.026
You're looking
to explain.

03:26.059 --> 03:26.893
And I'm not interested.

03:26.927 --> 03:28.862
Look, what you saw, it--

03:28.895 --> 03:30.130
I'm late for work.

03:30.163 --> 03:31.698
We at least need
to discuss this, for God's sake.

03:31.732 --> 03:33.734
I'm not gonna sit around
while you lie about it.

03:33.767 --> 03:34.768
I'm not going to lie.

03:34.801 --> 03:36.603
DOLE: Bobby,
I can always tell.

03:36.637 --> 03:37.871
Your lips move.

03:37.904 --> 03:38.605
Come on, honey.

03:38.639 --> 03:39.640
Let's go.

03:41.808 --> 03:43.510
MAN (over TV):
It marks the 22nd time

03:43.544 --> 03:45.078
the Office
of the Attorney General

03:45.111 --> 03:47.781
has overruled
the recommendation committee

03:47.814 --> 03:50.150
and is seeking the death
penalty but with the court...

03:50.183 --> 03:51.251
FRUTT: You have
a trial date yet?

03:51.284 --> 03:52.252
July.

03:52.285 --> 03:53.820
Any luck finding
the kid he shot at?

03:53.854 --> 03:54.955
They found him.

03:54.988 --> 03:57.624
Police have no interest
in arresting him.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.802
MAN (over TV): ...meanwhile,
CBS President Les Moonves

04:01.835 --> 04:03.169
was a no-show this morning

04:03.203 --> 04:04.571
at an environmental
fundraiser

04:04.605 --> 04:05.939
where he was scheduled to be

04:05.972 --> 04:07.674
the keynote speaker.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.676
Organizers express outrage.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.444
(phone ringing)

04:11.477 --> 04:13.213
HATCHER: Donnell, Young,
and Frutt.

04:15.582 --> 04:17.416
He seems in a good mood.

04:18.752 --> 04:21.454
Jimmy, she says
she's a client.

04:21.487 --> 04:22.322
Won't give her name,

04:22.355 --> 04:23.389
but she needs to speak to you.

04:25.425 --> 04:27.794
This is James Berluti.

04:27.828 --> 04:28.995
I'm listening.

04:29.029 --> 04:30.931
Grace?

04:30.964 --> 04:31.932
Okay.

04:31.965 --> 04:33.633
Where are you?

04:33.667 --> 04:36.235
All right, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

04:36.269 --> 04:37.436
CHAPMAN (over phone): Now...

04:37.470 --> 04:39.072
I'm on my way.

04:43.343 --> 04:44.911
What kind of an emergency?

04:44.945 --> 04:45.779
I don't know.

04:45.812 --> 04:46.813
She has no appointment,

04:46.847 --> 04:48.348
but she claims she's--

04:49.516 --> 04:50.283
Lindsay Dole.

04:50.316 --> 04:51.818
We met.

04:51.852 --> 04:54.387
I won't take up much
of your time.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.389
Are you having an affair
with my husband?

05:02.335 --> 05:03.737
Marsha, would you excuse us?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.872
Definitely.

05:09.976 --> 05:10.811
Why don't we sit?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.112
I'd rather stand.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.681
Before I forget
my question,

05:14.715 --> 05:16.116
let me ask it again.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.919
Are you having an affair
with my husband?

05:18.952 --> 05:20.921
No, I'm not.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.222
There, you have your answer.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.456
You can go now.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.426
Or if you'd like
to have a conversation,

05:26.459 --> 05:27.961
you can sit.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.466
(elevator bell dings)

05:40.340 --> 05:43.343
BERLUTI: (sighs)

05:48.749 --> 05:49.750
Grace.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.253
What's the matter?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.121
CHAPMAN: Just a second.

06:01.334 --> 06:02.903
BERLUTI: What are you doing?

06:04.170 --> 06:05.506
CHAPMAN: I'll explain
in a second.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.439
BERLUTI: Grace,
what the hell

06:06.472 --> 06:08.341
is going on here?

06:09.442 --> 06:11.011
Hey!

06:11.044 --> 06:12.478
Get these things off of me.

06:12.513 --> 06:13.446
In time, Jimmy.

06:13.479 --> 06:14.548
How long have we known
each other?

06:14.581 --> 06:15.882
What's going on?

06:16.482 --> 06:17.751
See the tape

06:17.784 --> 06:19.352
and the wires?

06:19.385 --> 06:21.321
They're connected to bombs.

06:21.354 --> 06:23.690
Anyone tries to come
in this room--boom!

06:23.724 --> 06:25.258
It's important
you know that.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.661
Grace, what the hell
are you doing here?

06:27.694 --> 06:29.162
It gets crazier.

06:29.195 --> 06:30.396
Come with me.

06:30.430 --> 06:33.233
Have you lost weight,
by the way?

06:34.234 --> 06:35.669
What do you think?

06:35.702 --> 06:36.837
Take your time.

06:38.639 --> 06:41.508
Is that, who I think it is?

06:41.542 --> 06:42.876
Of course it is.

06:42.909 --> 06:43.910
Les Moonves.

06:43.944 --> 06:46.446
This is his hotel suite,
actually.

06:46.479 --> 06:48.181
I showed up as room service.

06:48.214 --> 06:51.317
Coffee, tea, gun.

06:52.318 --> 06:53.253
I know.

06:53.286 --> 06:54.154
I'm nuts.

06:54.187 --> 06:55.756
But we knew that already.

06:55.789 --> 06:57.457
You want to hear my plan?

06:58.324 --> 06:59.793
I'll take that as a yes.

06:59.826 --> 07:01.635
You see these cameras?

07:01.668 --> 07:02.869
I'm satellite ready.

07:02.903 --> 07:05.271
I could email the footage.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.407
Check out the cannon.

07:09.610 --> 07:12.813
My idea for a reality
television show,

07:12.846 --> 07:15.115
"How to Blow Up

07:15.148 --> 07:16.983
a Network President."

07:17.017 --> 07:19.052
I'm technologically ready

07:19.085 --> 07:20.521
to go out live

07:20.554 --> 07:21.922
with a game of Russian roulette,

07:21.955 --> 07:23.323
tonight, 9:00.

07:23.356 --> 07:24.791
I was thinking about 8:00

07:24.825 --> 07:27.060
because the hut levels
are higher, but...

07:27.093 --> 07:28.762
kids shouldn't see this.

07:28.795 --> 07:29.996
Wouldn't you agree?

07:30.997 --> 07:32.432
I know Les does.

07:32.465 --> 07:34.134
Look at him.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.603
Tell me he's not sexy.

07:37.403 --> 07:38.171
Grace--

07:38.204 --> 07:40.507
Your job, Mr. Attorney,

07:40.541 --> 07:42.576
is to negotiate
my deal with CBS.

07:43.076 --> 07:45.111
I'll give them exclusive
broadcast rights.

07:45.145 --> 07:46.446
$4 million.

07:46.479 --> 07:47.581
That'll include foreign.

07:47.614 --> 07:49.015
You're out of your mind.

07:49.049 --> 07:50.050
We knew this.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.018
BERLUTI: You think CBS
is gonna pay you

07:52.052 --> 07:53.119
$4 million

07:53.153 --> 07:54.921
to blow up their President?

07:54.955 --> 07:57.223
It's Russian roulette, Jimmy.

07:57.257 --> 07:59.159
He might survive.

07:59.192 --> 08:01.067
I was thinking
of calling it "Survivor"

08:01.101 --> 08:02.168
with a question mark.

08:02.202 --> 08:03.770
Do you like that title?

08:03.804 --> 08:05.672
I know Les does.

08:05.706 --> 08:06.372
BERLUTI: Grace--

08:06.406 --> 08:07.708
CHAPMAN: The thing is...

08:07.741 --> 08:08.441
they wouldn't be paying me

08:08.474 --> 08:09.309
to play the game.

08:09.342 --> 08:10.310
I'm playing the game

08:10.343 --> 08:11.545
with or without them.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.379
It's important
that you make that clear.

08:13.413 --> 08:16.449
The game is played
no matter what.

08:16.482 --> 08:18.251
They wouldn't be an accessory.

08:18.284 --> 08:20.186
The only question is...

08:20.220 --> 08:22.055
do they want to benefit
from the footage.

08:22.088 --> 08:24.257
The police will be all over
this room as soon as--

08:24.290 --> 08:26.960
CHAPMAN: The police
can't get in here, Jimmy.

08:26.993 --> 08:28.829
I thought this out.

08:28.862 --> 08:29.863
The doors and the windows

08:29.896 --> 08:31.497
are wired with munitions.

08:31.532 --> 08:32.966
Anyone tries to get in here,

08:32.999 --> 08:34.366
and we all go boom!

08:34.400 --> 08:35.235
The three of us.

08:35.268 --> 08:37.070
Boom, boom, and boom.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.205
BERLUTI: Okay, obviously,
you've gone off

08:39.239 --> 08:40.206
your medication.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.375
You say that like
it's a negative,

08:42.408 --> 08:44.444
the fact that I'm crazy.

08:44.477 --> 08:46.279
Three more share points,
minimum.

08:46.312 --> 08:47.848
Call the network,
make the deal.

08:47.881 --> 08:48.749
You can't be--

08:48.782 --> 08:49.583
CHAPMAN: Jimmy,

08:49.616 --> 08:52.553
make the deal.

08:56.356 --> 08:58.458
We have no information
on who the woman is

08:58.491 --> 09:00.100
or how she got into the room,

09:00.133 --> 09:01.835
but it is confirmed

09:01.868 --> 09:05.071
she has kidnapped
CBS President Les Moonves.

09:05.105 --> 09:07.007
Unbelievable.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.109
And she expects
to get $4 million?

09:09.142 --> 09:11.311
ABC paid six
for Michael Jackson.

09:11.344 --> 09:12.946
And they didn't even get
to blow him up.

09:12.979 --> 09:14.815
FBI is on their way.

09:17.117 --> 09:20.120
The suspect now has been
identified as Grace Chapman,

09:20.153 --> 09:22.088
extremely intelligent,

09:22.122 --> 09:24.390
served six months
at Fisher's Hospital,

09:24.424 --> 09:26.693
treated for
a bipolar disorder.

09:26.727 --> 09:27.761
We're still trying to learn

09:27.794 --> 09:28.962
as to how she got
in the room...

09:28.995 --> 09:30.230
Are you watching this?

09:30.263 --> 09:31.532
Yeah.

09:31.565 --> 09:33.099
You people know this psycho?

09:33.133 --> 09:34.467
Former client.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.069
(sighs)

09:36.770 --> 09:37.671
Lindsay been in yet?

09:38.371 --> 09:40.273
No, and she hasn't called.

09:40.306 --> 09:41.608
I'm starting to worry.

09:43.409 --> 09:44.645
A goodbye kiss?

09:44.678 --> 09:45.478
BARKER: Yes.

09:45.512 --> 09:47.080
And that's probably--

09:47.113 --> 09:48.281
How was the hello kiss?

09:49.249 --> 09:50.951
Have you listened
to a word I've said?

09:50.984 --> 09:52.385
DOLE: No, and I don't want
to listen.

09:52.418 --> 09:53.887
BARKER: Which may be part
of the problem, Lindsay,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.188
no offense.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.223
But Bobby came searching
for a pair of ears more than--

09:57.257 --> 09:58.592
Oh, are you gonna play
therapist now?

09:58.625 --> 09:59.760
I'm not trying to--

09:59.793 --> 10:01.167
You commit adultery
with my husband--

10:01.201 --> 10:02.903
I didn't commit adultery, we--

10:02.936 --> 10:04.605
Because you didn't have time.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.172
You got caught.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.374
Look, it was wrong
for us to kiss.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.209
Gee.

10:09.242 --> 10:09.943
BARKER: But as I said,

10:09.976 --> 10:11.211
the reason--

10:12.345 --> 10:15.081
look, the fact
that you're even here--

10:15.115 --> 10:17.383
don't you think it's odd
that you're talking to me

10:17.417 --> 10:19.252
about this and not Bobby?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.787
(scoffs)

10:20.821 --> 10:23.089
BARKER: Hold on.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.391
You owe me nothing,

10:25.425 --> 10:27.193
and other than an apology,

10:27.227 --> 10:28.294
I owe you nothing.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.496
But under the theory
that you came here

10:30.531 --> 10:32.132
in some kind of a search
for the truth,

10:32.866 --> 10:35.736
the truth is
Bobby loves you very much,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.873
but he's lost all ability
to communicate with you.

10:39.906 --> 10:40.974
Really?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.643
Yes, really.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.245
And from what I've heard,
and, admittedly,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.047
I have only heard his side,

10:47.080 --> 10:49.616
you've pushed him
to the place he is in.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.052
You've shut him out.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.556
The company
he sought with me,

10:55.589 --> 10:57.290
and, yes, the need
for the kiss,

10:57.323 --> 10:59.626
it came from loneliness.

11:01.635 --> 11:03.504
And you really need
to examine

11:03.537 --> 11:05.572
your own role in that.

11:09.109 --> 11:12.012
I so enjoy being lectured to
by the woman--

11:12.045 --> 11:13.146
Hey, you came here, so--

11:13.179 --> 11:14.881
How dare you presume

11:14.915 --> 11:16.850
to tell me how to be
a better wife?

11:16.883 --> 11:18.519
I didn't do that.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.986
DOLE: Yes, you did.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.756
Forgive me
for being so naive

11:22.789 --> 11:25.759
thinking communication
is built on trust,

11:25.792 --> 11:27.594
believing that for intimacy,

11:27.628 --> 11:29.162
you first need honesty.

11:29.195 --> 11:30.664
Now who's lecturing?

11:32.766 --> 11:34.868
Here's a little advice
from me.

11:34.901 --> 11:37.738
Not quite as eloquent
but for what it's worth,

11:37.771 --> 11:40.306
keep away from my husband.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.387
(helicopter blades whirring)

11:54.420 --> 11:56.723
(siren wailing)

11:56.757 --> 11:58.825
REPORTER: Right now,
I'm standing about 60 feet

11:58.859 --> 12:00.667
outside of the room
where Mr. Moonves

12:00.701 --> 12:02.035
is being held captive.

12:02.068 --> 12:03.469
It is still--
You have to leave.

12:03.504 --> 12:04.505
Hey, whoa, whoa!

12:04.538 --> 12:05.606
Uh, as you can see,
the situation

12:05.639 --> 12:06.807
is very tense here.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.041
I am being jostled

12:08.074 --> 12:09.910
and escorted out of here...

12:09.943 --> 12:11.545
GAMBLE: How did she even
get in there?

12:11.578 --> 12:13.346
She first abducted
the guy from room service.

12:13.379 --> 12:15.215
They found him duct-taped
in a laundry hamper.

12:15.248 --> 12:16.149
Do we think this room

12:16.182 --> 12:18.018
is really wired
with munitions?

12:18.051 --> 12:19.853
Her I.Q.
is off the charts.

12:19.886 --> 12:22.322
She's no dummy.

12:22.355 --> 12:25.025
(sighs) And she can
transmit the video?

12:25.058 --> 12:26.693
So she says.

12:26.727 --> 12:28.294
Anyway, it's FBI
jurisdiction now.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.329
We're out.

12:30.531 --> 12:33.166
BERLUTI: You can't
get away with this.

12:33.199 --> 12:35.101
CHAPMAN: I'm not looking
to get away with it.

12:35.135 --> 12:36.469
Diminished capacity.

12:36.503 --> 12:37.403
I'll do my three years.

12:37.437 --> 12:39.072
Eight if Les goes boom.

12:39.105 --> 12:40.941
Either way, for $4 million.

12:40.974 --> 12:42.208
BERLUTI: You really think

12:42.242 --> 12:43.343
you'll see a nickel?

12:43.376 --> 12:44.978
We have son of Sam Laws.

12:45.011 --> 12:46.513
That money--
CHAPMAN: Goes to Switzerland,

12:46.547 --> 12:47.347
remember?

12:47.380 --> 12:48.414
Possession, Jimmy.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.617
Possession, nine-tenths
of the law.

12:50.651 --> 12:52.052
Are you hungry?

12:52.085 --> 12:53.286
Les didn't eat his waffle.

12:53.319 --> 12:54.521
BERLUTI: Be reasonable.

12:54.555 --> 12:56.923
They're never
gonna pay you that money.

12:56.957 --> 12:58.358
You know what I love
about you?

12:58.391 --> 12:59.726
Your eternal optimism.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.235
Here you have
a client who's hijacked

13:02.268 --> 13:03.236
a network president,

13:03.269 --> 13:04.905
kidnapped you,
wired a hotel room

13:04.938 --> 13:06.540
to blow up, and still

13:06.573 --> 13:08.942
you ask her
to be reasonable.

13:08.975 --> 13:11.377
You are too cute!

13:11.411 --> 13:12.946
Isn't he cute?

13:17.450 --> 13:19.285
This actually
isn't the first time

13:19.319 --> 13:21.487
a kidnapper has bargained
for airtime.

13:21.522 --> 13:23.056
If you remember Waco,

13:23.089 --> 13:25.826
the Federal Government actually
encouraged the media

13:25.859 --> 13:28.494
to broadcast the messages
of David Koresh

13:28.529 --> 13:30.864
in exchange
for the release of hostages.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.600
The government also encouraged
the print media

13:33.634 --> 13:36.269
to publish
the Unabomber's manifesto.

13:36.302 --> 13:37.871
But in those situations,

13:37.904 --> 13:39.640
the criminal
was demanding airtime.

13:39.673 --> 13:41.007
In this case, Ms. Chapman

13:41.041 --> 13:42.576
is basically selling it.

13:42.609 --> 13:43.677
DONNELL:
We represented her

13:43.710 --> 13:45.078
in some commitment
proceedings.

13:45.111 --> 13:45.912
SMOLLER:
When's the last time

13:45.946 --> 13:47.047
you had contact with her?

13:47.080 --> 13:48.582
DONNELL:
Over three years ago.

13:48.615 --> 13:50.350
And Mr. Berluti
was always the Attorney?

13:50.383 --> 13:52.252
He and Ellenor Frutt.

13:52.285 --> 13:53.053
SMOLLER: Can we speak
to Ms. Frutt?

13:53.086 --> 13:53.787
Of course.

13:53.820 --> 13:55.255
Ellenor.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.433
Your firm's
involved in this?

14:00.901 --> 14:02.102
What are you doing here?

14:02.135 --> 14:02.836
I tried you on the phone,

14:02.869 --> 14:03.804
but your assistant said

14:03.837 --> 14:05.171
you'd moved
to Czechoslovakia.

14:06.372 --> 14:07.941
Rebecca made me.

14:07.974 --> 14:08.642
Come on.

14:19.085 --> 14:21.121
You're coming
to my office--

14:21.154 --> 14:23.023
She came to mine.

14:23.056 --> 14:24.691
What?
BARKER: Lindsay,

14:24.725 --> 14:27.160
she stormed into my office,
had a few choice French words

14:27.193 --> 14:28.494
to say, and then she left.

14:28.529 --> 14:29.763
I've been trying
to get you on the phone,

14:29.796 --> 14:31.898
but Lucy wouldn't give me
your number in Prague.

14:32.799 --> 14:35.201
She came to your office?

14:35.235 --> 14:37.437
Bobby, far be it from me
to give advice--

14:37.470 --> 14:38.705
I tried that
an hour ago--

14:38.739 --> 14:40.340
DONNELL: I'll take care of it.

14:40.373 --> 14:42.442
Listen, if you are as serious
about your marriage

14:42.475 --> 14:44.477
as you claim to be,

14:44.511 --> 14:46.379
you need to get back
into therapy now.

14:46.412 --> 14:47.948
(door opens)

14:54.420 --> 14:55.722
We'd like you to advise her

14:55.756 --> 14:57.257
that the money's been
wired already.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.859
We can't do that.

14:58.892 --> 15:00.233
Why not?

15:00.266 --> 15:01.935
Because the money
hasn't been wired.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.104
We have an obligation
to be honest with our client.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.672
Crime-fraud exception.

15:05.706 --> 15:07.240
You can legally--
I don't think so.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.510
You can legally
withhold information, Counsel.

15:09.543 --> 15:10.911
But we can't lie.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.979
SMOLLER: She's got a cannon
pointed at a man.

15:13.013 --> 15:13.647
You can surely make--

15:13.680 --> 15:14.548
FRUTT: Exactly.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.382
Including a friend of mine.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.585
And we're not gonna
jeopardize his life.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.625
Why aren't they calling back?

15:24.658 --> 15:25.592
BERLUTI: Grace,

15:25.626 --> 15:27.894
even if they did wire
the money,

15:27.928 --> 15:30.063
they could still seize it
in Switzerland after--

15:30.096 --> 15:32.799
I have things taken care of
over there, trust me.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.034
REPORTER (over TV):
We have with us now

15:34.067 --> 15:35.268
Dr. Raymond Hewlitt.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.770
Dr. Hewlitt,
thank you for joining us.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.039
You treated Ms. Chapman,
did you not?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.307
HEWLITT (over TV): Yes, I did.
Hey! Doctor-patient privilege!

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
(gunshots)

15:54.621 --> 15:57.423
We repeat, a gunshot
has been heard,

15:57.457 --> 16:01.201
a loud, shot-like noise
coming from a gun.

16:01.234 --> 16:03.403
My God.

16:03.436 --> 16:05.005
Everybody's safe.

16:05.038 --> 16:07.107
She just shot
the television.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.542
Nobody's been hurt.

16:08.575 --> 16:11.678
That's an update,
not a final.

16:11.712 --> 16:13.113
Listen to me.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.515
However nuts you are,

16:14.548 --> 16:15.982
you have to know the network

16:16.016 --> 16:17.518
won't play along with this.

16:17.551 --> 16:19.052
I don't have to know that.

16:19.085 --> 16:20.921
The entertainment
and news divisions have become

16:20.954 --> 16:23.023
so blurred--
BERLUTI: Even if they wire

16:23.056 --> 16:25.025
the money, they'll figure out
how to get it back.

16:25.058 --> 16:27.628
And if your plan
is to somehow leave the country,

16:27.661 --> 16:29.663
they'd extradite you so fast.

16:29.696 --> 16:31.164
I don't expect
to get away, Jimmy.

16:31.197 --> 16:32.533
I'll do my three years.

16:32.566 --> 16:33.967
It'll be much more than that.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.769
I don't think so.

16:35.802 --> 16:36.637
And all I need from you

16:36.670 --> 16:37.938
is for you and your law firm

16:37.971 --> 16:39.540
to help execute the deal,

16:39.573 --> 16:40.907
nothing more!

16:40.941 --> 16:43.510
You're starting
to piss me off.

16:48.314 --> 16:51.284
Without making any excuse

16:51.317 --> 16:52.819
for kissing her,

16:52.853 --> 16:54.621
because there is none.

16:57.423 --> 17:00.567
I have been accused of...

17:00.601 --> 17:03.169
craving isolation.

17:04.304 --> 17:06.673
Maybe I became desperate

17:06.707 --> 17:10.544
to share anything

17:10.577 --> 17:12.145
with anybody.

17:12.813 --> 17:15.214
Again, does that excuse
what I did?

17:15.715 --> 17:17.250
No.

17:17.282 --> 17:18.585
But...

17:21.253 --> 17:23.156
Do you actually expect me
to fall for that?

17:24.891 --> 17:27.426
You want company, Bobby?

17:28.461 --> 17:29.830
I mean, you want to share?

17:29.863 --> 17:32.999
Go out for a beer
with Eugene.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.768
Take me to dinner.

17:34.801 --> 17:37.037
You don't go
to an Italian restaurant

17:37.070 --> 17:38.805
with a woman
you used to sleep with

17:38.839 --> 17:40.574
and then kiss her.

17:41.742 --> 17:42.943
I...

17:45.145 --> 17:47.047
have become...

17:47.080 --> 17:50.617
emotionally void.

17:51.151 --> 17:52.586
Do you get that?

17:55.689 --> 17:58.525
How much of a father
can I be if...

17:59.893 --> 18:02.435
You did this, in part,
for our son?

18:09.510 --> 18:12.112
I'm glad you got it all
worked out, Bobby,

18:13.880 --> 18:15.916
because I'll tell ya,
I certainly don't.

18:22.355 --> 18:23.624
I don't have a clue

18:23.657 --> 18:25.759
as to what I should do now.

18:27.761 --> 18:29.830
I want our son to have
his mother and father

18:29.863 --> 18:31.097
in the same house.

18:31.131 --> 18:32.198
It would devastate him

18:32.232 --> 18:33.266
if we were to split up.

18:33.299 --> 18:35.035
But I don't--
I don't know how to live

18:35.068 --> 18:36.570
in the same house

18:36.603 --> 18:38.805
with a man I no longer trust.

18:42.408 --> 18:43.744
So...

18:45.345 --> 18:48.749
I either leave you

18:50.383 --> 18:53.954
or I coexist with...

18:53.987 --> 18:56.623
(sobs)

18:56.657 --> 18:58.659
I don't know what to do.

19:17.718 --> 19:20.420
We're now being told
the explosives are real.

19:20.453 --> 19:22.589
Dogs from the bomb squad
have been sniffing,

19:22.623 --> 19:24.290
and the doors have,
in fact, been rigged

19:24.324 --> 19:25.826
with some kind
of explosive device.

19:25.859 --> 19:27.127
Why aren't they making
this deal?

19:27.160 --> 19:27.994
I have their President.

19:28.028 --> 19:28.795
For God's sake,

19:28.829 --> 19:29.730
why aren't they calling?

19:29.763 --> 19:31.064
They said
they needed time.

19:31.097 --> 19:33.133
CHAPMAN: Time is running out.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.235
(phone ringing)

19:37.470 --> 19:38.438
We're here.
MICHAELS (over phone): Grace,

19:38.471 --> 19:39.906
this is Officer Michaels--

19:39.940 --> 19:40.741
I told you,

19:40.774 --> 19:42.676
no negotiation.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.077
Call here again,
Officer Michaels,

19:44.110 --> 19:45.779
and someone gets shot,

19:45.812 --> 19:48.248
and it won't be me.

19:48.281 --> 19:50.350
I want to hear
from Ellenor Frutt

19:50.383 --> 19:52.052
or Eugene Young only,

19:52.085 --> 19:53.654
and only about the deal.

19:55.221 --> 19:58.091
I don't think
they love you enough, Les.

19:59.092 --> 20:01.434
You saved this network.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.537
You brought them back
from the grave.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.839
You would think they'd want
to save you from yours.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.343
Thirteen, on the air.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.078
That is sweet,

20:12.613 --> 20:14.247
but I don't think
you have the capacity

20:14.280 --> 20:15.649
to enter into a contract.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.618
It would be duress.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.388
Why are you so calm?

20:22.422 --> 20:24.324
This disturbs me.

20:29.129 --> 20:31.832
Jimmy says
she's getting more erratic.

20:31.865 --> 20:32.666
Call him back.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.835
Tell him to stall
as much as--

20:34.868 --> 20:35.869
She's too smart.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.703
STRINGER: Can I ask,

20:36.737 --> 20:38.304
do you people even have a plan

20:38.338 --> 20:40.206
besides seeking
the death penalty?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.174
Who are you?

20:41.207 --> 20:42.008
I'm pretty.

20:42.042 --> 20:42.809
Who are you?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.146
FRUTT: Look, you are flirting
with a disaster here if you--

20:46.179 --> 20:47.380
Thank you, Ms. Frutt.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.850
Just call him--
My colleague is in that room.

20:49.883 --> 20:50.751
He's my friend.

20:50.784 --> 20:52.653
Your behavioral unit
is saying

20:52.686 --> 20:53.554
give her the broadcast,

20:53.587 --> 20:55.321
your tactical unit
is saying don't.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.558
That's exactly the indecision
that led to the Waco--

20:57.591 --> 20:58.759
Ms. Frutt.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.034
That woman is nuts.

21:01.067 --> 21:02.703
She has a cannon.

21:03.937 --> 21:05.405
A Mr. Sandy Grushow
is calling.

21:05.438 --> 21:06.707
He says it's important.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.341
He's from the Fox Network.

21:11.612 --> 21:12.779
Urgent?
MARSHA: Yes.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.047
The urgent woman.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.081
She's back.

21:15.115 --> 21:16.683
The same woman
from this morning?

21:16.717 --> 21:17.551
Yes.

21:18.284 --> 21:20.286
Okay.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.254
Send her in.

21:21.287 --> 21:22.455
But if I yell
or hit the intercom,

21:22.488 --> 21:23.557
you send in security.

21:23.590 --> 21:24.758
Are you sure?

21:24.791 --> 21:25.959
Yeah, send her in.

21:36.637 --> 21:38.371
This is how pathetic it is.

21:38.404 --> 21:41.307
For honesty,
I come to you instead of him.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.076
And please,
don't lecture me

21:43.109 --> 21:44.945
on how symptomatic
that is of our marriage.

21:44.978 --> 21:46.647
I don't need--
BARKER: Lindsay,

21:46.680 --> 21:48.381
what do you want?

21:50.383 --> 21:52.853
I need to know--

21:52.886 --> 21:54.955
I need to know what he--
what he said a--

22:00.601 --> 22:02.569
I don't know
what's going on.

22:05.071 --> 22:07.407
Well, do you really want
my dime-store psychology?

22:08.842 --> 22:10.043
Yes.

22:11.377 --> 22:13.680
What did you two talk about?

22:13.714 --> 22:15.348
I need to know what...

22:23.857 --> 22:27.493
Mostly we talked about you,

22:27.528 --> 22:29.395
about his job,

22:29.429 --> 22:32.432
being a
criminal-defense lawyer.

22:32.465 --> 22:35.468
He no longer believes
in what he does.

22:35.502 --> 22:39.172
And what he does,
what he is,

22:39.205 --> 22:40.406
they're the same.

22:43.744 --> 22:45.211
What does that have
to do with me?

22:45.245 --> 22:46.580
I'm getting to that.

22:48.982 --> 22:51.451
The man doesn't believe
in what he is

22:53.353 --> 22:56.022
and he's desperate for you
to hold him,

22:56.056 --> 22:58.892
to give him
some kind of affirmation

22:58.925 --> 23:00.500
as well as love.

23:03.837 --> 23:05.205
And you give him neither.

23:11.077 --> 23:12.245
And he's just
becoming desperate

23:12.278 --> 23:14.080
to find it
wherever he can.

23:23.189 --> 23:25.225
Is he in love with you?

23:27.728 --> 23:29.362
That, I don't know.

23:29.395 --> 23:30.463
For some things,
you're still going to have

23:30.496 --> 23:32.398
to go to him for answers.

23:34.367 --> 23:36.570
Are you in love with him?

23:41.141 --> 23:43.309
I'm not sure about that,
either.

23:50.651 --> 23:51.585
Fox?

23:51.618 --> 23:52.853
Under certain terms--
CHAPMAN: I'm not

23:52.886 --> 23:54.154
taking my clothes off.

23:54.187 --> 23:55.756
BERLUTI: Grace,
listen to me.

23:55.789 --> 23:57.457
Just stop talking
for 10 seconds.

23:57.490 --> 23:58.992
Can you do that?

23:59.025 --> 24:00.366
(sighs)

24:00.400 --> 24:01.602
The deal is...

24:01.635 --> 24:04.104
Fox agrees
to pay you the money,

24:04.137 --> 24:05.405
air the broadcast,

24:05.438 --> 24:07.473
so long as you promise
not to hurt him.

24:07.508 --> 24:09.510
Then the whole thing
would be a fake.

24:09.543 --> 24:10.276
Where's the drama?

24:10.310 --> 24:11.645
BERLUTI: Just listen.

24:11.678 --> 24:14.480
We would keep it secret
that the game is rigged.

24:14.515 --> 24:17.450
You'll get all the suspense
of a real Russian roulette game

24:17.483 --> 24:18.619
and your money.

24:21.021 --> 24:22.556
Attorney-client privilege?

24:23.389 --> 24:24.424
Of course.

24:25.191 --> 24:26.226
The cannon's fake.

24:26.259 --> 24:28.161
It only shoots blanks.

24:28.862 --> 24:30.063
(sighs)

24:30.664 --> 24:31.732
The gun's real.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.636
So we can make this deal
with Fox?

24:35.669 --> 24:37.370
I want a non-duress clause--

24:37.403 --> 24:40.741
liquidated damages
of 10 million.

24:40.774 --> 24:43.577
If they reveal
the cannon is fake

24:43.610 --> 24:47.480
and if they give
the ending away at all.

24:51.918 --> 24:54.054
How could they
possibly agree to air this?

24:54.087 --> 24:54.921
WASHINGTON: Well...

24:54.955 --> 24:56.690
"Well" what?
It's repulsive.

24:56.723 --> 24:59.025
If it saves the guy's life.

24:59.059 --> 25:01.034
Plus, a network president
being kidnapped,

25:01.067 --> 25:02.168
that is news.

25:02.202 --> 25:03.770
That makes it decent to televise

25:03.804 --> 25:04.971
her Russian roulette game?

25:05.739 --> 25:08.274
Remember the TWA hijacking?

25:08.308 --> 25:11.011
CBS went into the cockpit
with cameras,

25:11.044 --> 25:12.445
covered the whole thing,

25:12.478 --> 25:14.014
even though they figured it
to be staged.

25:14.047 --> 25:15.682
That hijacking wasn't staged.

25:15.716 --> 25:17.784
But their little
show-and-tell was.

25:17.818 --> 25:20.186
And Dan rather said,
"So what?

25:20.220 --> 25:22.656
The activity of a hijacker,
real or staged,

25:22.689 --> 25:24.457
is news, and you cover it."

25:30.096 --> 25:30.897
Is Bobby here?

25:30.931 --> 25:32.566
HATCHER: He's in his office.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.715
I went to see Sarah again.

25:52.185 --> 25:55.321
Don't ask me why.

25:55.355 --> 25:57.991
I guess I'm (sighs)

25:58.024 --> 25:59.660
desperate to make some sense

25:59.693 --> 26:02.335
of how you could kiss
somebody else.

26:03.303 --> 26:05.939
Desperate for a reason
I can live with.

26:08.274 --> 26:09.510
(sighs)

26:12.913 --> 26:15.081
Please tell me
how this could happen.

26:24.691 --> 26:27.528
I think a few weeks ago
you kind of said

26:27.561 --> 26:30.797
we don't address us

26:32.398 --> 26:35.769
because neither of us
wants to face the truth.

26:39.105 --> 26:41.374
We both believe...

26:41.407 --> 26:43.544
in partnership,
but we both sense

26:43.577 --> 26:44.811
we're not partners.

26:50.283 --> 26:53.153
I think we walk away,

26:54.621 --> 26:56.389
start over.

26:57.624 --> 26:59.225
If not for our little boy,

27:06.239 --> 27:09.375
neither of us is the type
of person who could do that--

27:11.545 --> 27:13.547
walk away with a child.

27:17.383 --> 27:19.753
I think the reason
you so shut me out--

27:19.786 --> 27:21.755
I haven't.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.425
You're trying
to make me leave you.

27:27.227 --> 27:29.663
You want it to be my doing.

27:31.998 --> 27:34.701
And maybe,

27:34.735 --> 27:36.402
on some unconscious level,

27:36.436 --> 27:38.505
my going to dinner
with Sarah,

27:38.539 --> 27:40.006
kissing her.

27:43.443 --> 27:45.646
Maybe I'm trying
to make you leave me.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.815
You wanted to get caught?

27:56.056 --> 27:57.257
I don't know.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.204
(sighs)

28:07.440 --> 28:08.942
So, what do we do?

28:20.754 --> 28:22.523
Look, none of us here at Fox

28:22.556 --> 28:24.825
want to see
Les Moonves blown up.

28:24.858 --> 28:27.160
STRINGER:
Okay, this is insane now!

28:27.193 --> 28:28.562
Not to NBC.

28:28.595 --> 28:30.263
They want in.
What?

28:30.296 --> 28:31.698
HATCHER: They think
if they can help save

28:31.732 --> 28:32.999
an innocent man,
they should.

28:33.033 --> 28:34.100
So we have two networks

28:34.134 --> 28:35.401
throwing money
at a kidnapper?

28:35.435 --> 28:36.903
Again, I ask,

28:36.937 --> 28:38.505
how is this different
than "60 Minutes"

28:38.539 --> 28:40.507
airing one of Kevorkian's
assisted suicides?

28:40.541 --> 28:42.308
They didn't pay Kevorkian.

28:42.342 --> 28:43.577
WASHINGTON: Yes, they did.

28:43.610 --> 28:47.180
The currency he wanted
was publicity, and he got it.

28:48.715 --> 28:49.883
He's an ass.

28:49.916 --> 28:51.652
It's complicated, Helen.

28:51.685 --> 28:53.854
GAMBLE: Of course
it's complicated.

28:53.887 --> 28:55.789
I would never pretend
to understand

28:55.822 --> 28:57.891
anybody else's relationship.

28:58.625 --> 29:01.267
But when a married man
with a child

29:01.301 --> 29:03.469
kisses another woman,

29:04.470 --> 29:06.339
he's crossed the line.

29:10.911 --> 29:13.479
She also won't back off
the indemnification.

29:13.514 --> 29:16.282
Look, suppose she gets sued
by some family

29:16.316 --> 29:17.951
somewhere claiming
to be traumatized,

29:17.984 --> 29:19.786
we can't--
YOUNG: Exactly.

29:19.820 --> 29:22.022
That's why
she wants protection.

29:23.824 --> 29:26.126
All right.

29:26.159 --> 29:29.295
Let's skip ahead
to the biggie, shall we?

29:29.663 --> 29:31.598
What do you mean
tell the FBI?

29:31.632 --> 29:33.600
Grace, there's a danger.

29:33.634 --> 29:34.968
As soon as the cannon goes off,

29:35.001 --> 29:36.002
they might charge in.

29:36.036 --> 29:37.137
I don't think so.

29:37.170 --> 29:39.072
The windows and doors
are wired to blow.

29:39.105 --> 29:39.906
BERLUTI: Exactly.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.808
I don't feel like blowing up.

29:41.842 --> 29:42.509
Do you?

29:45.579 --> 29:48.448
Actually, there are
no bombs there, either.

29:48.481 --> 29:50.517
I just smeared blasting cap.

29:50.551 --> 29:53.119
The dogs
sniffed trace amounts.

29:53.153 --> 29:54.655
It's enough to fool them.

29:56.723 --> 29:58.592
So there are
no bombs anywhere?

29:58.625 --> 30:00.867
I'll bet
that's a load off, huh?

30:00.901 --> 30:02.703
Yes, it is.

30:04.638 --> 30:06.740
But as your attorney,
I'm still advising you

30:06.773 --> 30:08.141
to call the whole thing off.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.375
Forget it.

30:09.943 --> 30:11.845
Listen to me.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.446
I suspect...

30:13.479 --> 30:15.315
more than the money

30:15.348 --> 30:17.083
you're looking for attention.

30:17.117 --> 30:18.552
Well, you've
already got that.

30:18.585 --> 30:21.154
This is playing on every channel
in the country.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.490
I want prime time,
and I do want the money.

30:24.525 --> 30:26.359
What's to stop
the next wacko

30:26.392 --> 30:28.529
from pulling
a stunt like this?

30:28.562 --> 30:31.464
Making an example
out of you, that's what.

30:32.132 --> 30:34.100
Let's call it off.

30:34.134 --> 30:35.836
You'll come out
with your 15 minutes,

30:35.869 --> 30:38.238
but not 15 years.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.706
Enough fun, Grace.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.241
Let's get out of this.

30:41.274 --> 30:44.044
Just let me know
when the money is wired.

30:46.947 --> 30:48.081
MAN (over TV):
Sources have confirmed

30:48.114 --> 30:50.483
that a wire transfer
of $4 million

30:50.517 --> 30:52.753
has been received
at the Swiss commercial bank.

30:53.554 --> 30:56.790
They're calling the game
"Shoot the moon,"

30:56.823 --> 30:58.659
though it's unclear
whether Mr. Moonves

30:58.692 --> 31:00.400
has been injured or not.

31:00.433 --> 31:01.735
MAN (over TV): In fact,
there's a sick joke

31:01.768 --> 31:04.137
making the rounds
that if the CBS Executive

31:04.170 --> 31:05.539
is indeed blown up,

31:05.572 --> 31:07.641
he'll actually be eaten
by contestants

31:07.674 --> 31:09.375
on next week's Fear Factor.

31:10.176 --> 31:12.779
FRUTT: It's official,
the world has gone mad.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.548
When will she release Jimmy?

31:14.581 --> 31:15.982
After it's over.

31:16.016 --> 31:17.117
Are we sure she will?

31:17.150 --> 31:19.820
He doesn't think she could
actually hurt anybody.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.623
What's going on in there?

31:22.656 --> 31:23.323
Do we know?

31:24.224 --> 31:26.426
He's in there alone.

31:26.459 --> 31:27.861
It isn't good.

31:38.371 --> 31:40.040
I screwed up, Bec.

31:42.809 --> 31:43.910
I kissed her.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.346
Sarah Barker.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.482
It wasn't going
any further.

31:50.150 --> 31:53.119
In fact, it was because
we were severing all.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.657
But I screwed up.

31:56.690 --> 31:58.124
Lindsay knows?

31:58.792 --> 32:00.466
She witnessed it.

32:04.571 --> 32:05.772
Where are you now?

32:06.372 --> 32:08.174
I don't...

32:08.208 --> 32:10.076
want to lose her.

32:11.311 --> 32:13.446
That much I know.

32:13.479 --> 32:15.015
Does she know that?

32:15.882 --> 32:18.084
(sighs)

32:18.118 --> 32:20.286
I don't think
she much cares at this point.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.855
I'd let her know
just the same.

32:22.523 --> 32:25.025
I can't even locate her
at the moment.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.295
Anything new on Jimmy?

32:29.329 --> 32:30.430
Is he safe?

32:30.463 --> 32:31.932
We believe so.

32:33.433 --> 32:36.436
Find your wife, Bobby,

32:37.170 --> 32:39.039
and tell her what you know.

32:43.209 --> 32:45.912
BERLUTI: She's feeding
the signal as we speak.

32:45.946 --> 32:49.049
Okay. Okay.

32:49.082 --> 32:50.050
They've asked you to wait

32:50.083 --> 32:51.518
till three minutes
past the hour

32:51.552 --> 32:53.286
to allow for the affiliate
station breaks.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.655
No problem.

32:54.688 --> 32:56.422
Okay, Jimmy,
you're my technician.

32:56.456 --> 32:58.592
You hit A, B, or C
on the keyboard,

32:58.625 --> 32:59.626
depending
on what camera I want.

32:59.660 --> 33:01.101
Grace.

33:03.103 --> 33:05.572
Why?

33:05.606 --> 33:07.541
Can you help me understand?

33:08.942 --> 33:10.711
I'm sure a lot of doctors
will come on TV

33:10.744 --> 33:12.212
and tell everybody the why

33:12.245 --> 33:14.247
in pursuit
of their 15 minutes.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.382
This isn't you.

33:17.951 --> 33:19.452
What's going on?

33:22.122 --> 33:23.824
Maybe...

33:23.857 --> 33:25.391
I just don't want
to be some tree

33:25.425 --> 33:26.993
falling in the forest.

33:37.971 --> 33:40.273
I need you
to look scared, okay?

33:40.306 --> 33:41.975
I'd un-tape your mouth,
but I can't trust you

33:42.008 --> 33:43.577
not to give away
the ending.

33:43.610 --> 33:46.312
You'd just love to spoil
Fox's numbers, I know.

33:47.013 --> 33:48.214
Also...

33:48.248 --> 33:51.852
I might have to sex it up
a little, you know?

33:51.885 --> 33:54.287
Gotta sell some cars.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.322
Okay, what time do we have?

33:56.356 --> 33:57.624
Ten minutes.

33:58.625 --> 34:01.367
Hi, I'm Grace Chapman.

34:01.401 --> 34:04.104
Welcome to "Les is More"

34:04.137 --> 34:06.807
or "Les is No More,"

34:06.840 --> 34:08.641
depending on luck,

34:08.675 --> 34:12.513
the gods, and, well, me.

34:12.545 --> 34:15.215
I'm the one
with the killer smile.

34:15.248 --> 34:16.850
What if she's lying?

34:16.882 --> 34:19.485
What if she does plan
to blow everything up?

34:19.520 --> 34:22.889
CHAPMAN: The question
I know most of you have--

34:22.922 --> 34:26.693
is this a hate thing

34:26.726 --> 34:29.663
or a sexual thing?

34:29.696 --> 34:33.132
Maybe I'm secretly in love

34:33.166 --> 34:35.936
with this handsome man.

34:35.969 --> 34:37.571
(smooches)

34:40.040 --> 34:42.408
Maybe I'm just
a praying mantis.

34:45.612 --> 34:47.112
Know how most reality shows

34:47.147 --> 34:49.049
always drag things out?

34:49.716 --> 34:51.918
Don't you just hate that?

34:51.952 --> 34:53.219
(cannon fires)

34:53.253 --> 34:54.454
Oh, my God.

34:55.288 --> 34:57.390
Or there's a big gap

34:57.423 --> 34:59.626
between all the action.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.134
(cannon fires)

35:01.167 --> 35:02.603
I can't take this.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.404
This isn't real.

35:04.838 --> 35:06.372
I can't watch.

35:06.406 --> 35:07.774
You'll remember that Koresh

35:07.808 --> 35:09.843
was granted radio airtime,

35:09.876 --> 35:12.178
but no prime-time broadcast
has ever...

35:12.212 --> 35:13.547
(explosions)

35:13.580 --> 35:15.148
I just pissed my pants.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.750
(explosions)

35:16.783 --> 35:18.519
WOMAN: Yesterday,
the Timothy McVeigh's

35:18.552 --> 35:19.720
of the world were vying

35:19.753 --> 35:21.955
for the covers
of Time and Newsweek.

35:21.988 --> 35:23.256
Today, the police...

35:23.289 --> 35:25.926
One has to question
the networks' complicity.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.360
They've essentially been saying,

35:27.393 --> 35:29.062
"Want to act like an idiot?

35:29.095 --> 35:30.664
We'll put you on TV."

35:30.697 --> 35:32.933
(cannon fires)

35:32.966 --> 35:34.234
Oh, dear.

35:34.267 --> 35:36.537
I'm down to my last shot.

35:36.570 --> 35:37.971
Camera C, Jimmy.

35:41.542 --> 35:43.343
Before I fire my last shot,

35:43.376 --> 35:45.612
I would like to talk
to all of you at home,

35:45.646 --> 35:48.549
my audience.

35:48.582 --> 35:51.451
My beloved consumers,

35:51.484 --> 35:52.886
why are you watching?

35:53.620 --> 35:55.956
Is it the spectacle?

35:55.989 --> 35:57.891
Is it the thought
of seeing the big

35:57.924 --> 36:00.100
and the powerful
brought down?

36:00.133 --> 36:02.268
Perhaps it's fun to...

36:02.302 --> 36:04.505
simply look at me and say,

36:04.538 --> 36:06.507
"Isn't she pathetic?

36:06.540 --> 36:08.675
A train wreck with nice tits."

36:09.676 --> 36:13.146
Do you delight
in seeing others demeaned

36:13.179 --> 36:16.750
so that you can
feel better, then?

36:16.783 --> 36:19.219
Maybe it makes you
feel intelligent

36:19.252 --> 36:22.188
to see stupidity showcased.

36:22.923 --> 36:24.925
My question is,

36:24.958 --> 36:27.227
do you just keep coming

36:27.260 --> 36:29.062
to the trough to drink

36:29.095 --> 36:31.732
no matter
what these people put in it?

36:31.765 --> 36:33.600
Do you feel...

36:33.634 --> 36:36.136
at all responsible?

36:37.838 --> 36:40.841
Well, enough
of these idle questions.

36:40.874 --> 36:43.744
We're not here to think,
are we?

36:43.777 --> 36:46.547
Let's get back
to the entertainment.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.748
But I do...

36:47.781 --> 36:49.382
want to thank you,

36:49.415 --> 36:52.485
my dear audience,

36:52.519 --> 36:56.056
after all, without you,

36:56.089 --> 36:58.625
I wouldn't be here.

36:59.225 --> 37:01.535
This one's for you.

37:01.568 --> 37:02.936
(cannon fires)

37:16.182 --> 37:17.551
(door opens)

37:19.419 --> 37:20.286
It still on?

37:20.320 --> 37:23.223
(sighs) It just went black.

37:23.256 --> 37:25.058
I think she blew up
the viewers.

37:25.659 --> 37:26.627
And Jimmy?

37:26.660 --> 37:27.794
DONNELL:
He should be released.

37:27.828 --> 37:29.362
Let's hope.

37:33.900 --> 37:34.935
So...

37:38.905 --> 37:39.973
Lindsay...

37:47.614 --> 37:49.015
I'm sorry.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.318
I know--

37:53.219 --> 37:54.588
I know
how it must sound

37:54.621 --> 37:56.623
when I say
what happened with.

38:02.636 --> 38:04.705
Whether you love me...

38:04.738 --> 38:06.072
or not,

38:07.808 --> 38:09.409
I still love you.

38:11.377 --> 38:13.279
That's the only thing
I do know...

38:13.313 --> 38:14.581
at the moment.

38:22.723 --> 38:24.224
Well, what I know,

38:27.928 --> 38:28.995
therapist tells us

38:29.029 --> 38:30.864
say what you feel,
not what you know.

38:31.765 --> 38:34.601
What I feel is anger...

38:34.635 --> 38:36.269
and hatred.

38:37.671 --> 38:39.573
I mean, I'll be honest,

38:40.974 --> 38:42.442
I hate you...

38:42.475 --> 38:43.944
at the moment.

38:46.479 --> 38:47.848
What I know,

38:47.881 --> 38:50.116
you're the father
of my child,

38:52.018 --> 38:53.353
you're my husband,

38:53.386 --> 38:54.755
and, uh...

38:56.990 --> 38:58.358
I love you.

39:01.535 --> 39:03.937
But I no longer know you.

39:03.970 --> 39:05.338
Beyond that,

39:05.371 --> 39:06.840
and don't trust you.

39:10.076 --> 39:12.078
I've taken Bobby Jr.
to my parents.

39:13.914 --> 39:15.115
He and I will be living there

39:15.148 --> 39:17.183
until we find another place.

39:17.217 --> 39:18.952
What are you talking about?

39:21.622 --> 39:23.056
I'm leaving you.

39:25.191 --> 39:26.359
We're done.

39:26.392 --> 39:28.829
Lindsay, you can't just--

39:30.096 --> 39:30.797
you can't.

39:30.831 --> 39:31.898
It's what you wanted.

39:34.935 --> 39:36.537
You win, Bobby.

39:43.109 --> 39:44.778
MAN (over TV): We've just
been informed Mr. Moonves

39:44.811 --> 39:45.979
has been escorted out.

39:46.012 --> 39:47.814
He is safe and relieved,

39:47.848 --> 39:49.215
though unhappy about lifting

39:49.249 --> 39:52.085
rival NBC's ratings
during sweeps.

39:52.118 --> 39:53.887
Ms. Chapman has been taken
into custody.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.923
Her attorney, James Berluti,
is also unharmed

39:56.957 --> 39:59.125
and relieved the ordeal
ended without incident.

39:59.159 --> 40:01.668
Next up tonight,
dramatic footage

40:01.702 --> 40:04.337
of a high-speed chase
that turns deadly

40:04.370 --> 40:06.973
when the driver
enters the Interstate...

40:07.007 --> 40:10.010
(music playing)

40:16.216 --> 40:18.519
DONNELL:
Next on The Practice...

40:18.552 --> 40:20.420
Hey, get out the truck.

40:20.453 --> 40:23.356
(tires screeching)

40:23.389 --> 40:25.692
MILLER: I saw the gun and then
I just hit the accelerator.

40:25.726 --> 40:26.860
Did you call the police?

40:26.893 --> 40:28.361
No.
What?

40:28.394 --> 40:31.632
GAMBLE: The man your client
ran over in her garage,

40:31.665 --> 40:33.233
he had a bullet in his back.

40:34.034 --> 40:35.602
DONNELL: Do you have feelings
for this woman?

40:35.636 --> 40:37.504
I might love her.

40:37.538 --> 40:40.040
You have to think of her
as a client.

40:40.073 --> 40:42.008
I can't do that, Bobby.

40:44.745 --> 40:47.748
(music playing)

41:09.543 --> 41:10.877
WOMAN: You stinker!

41:12.312 --> 41:15.248
(music playing)
