14:17.567 --> 14:18.968
Someone help me.

14:21.334 --> 14:23.300
Somewhere out there
must be someone

14:23.300 --> 14:24.968
who's suffered
as much as I have.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.200
I'm only glad my father
didn't live to see my shame.

14:29.934 --> 14:31.834
[TOILET
FLUSHES]

14:52.434 --> 14:55.801
Dad. I thought
you were dead.

14:55.801 --> 14:57.367
I thought you
were alive.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.868
Gee, Dad...

15:07.868 --> 15:09.868
last time I saw you
was at your funeral.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.901
You look great.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.067
They make you jog.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.534
So how's tricks?

15:16.534 --> 15:18.234
Great.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.901
And how are
the kids?

15:19.901 --> 15:21.267
Great.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.167
<i>And how are
my Playboys?</i>

15:27.200 --> 15:28.534
You know, don't you?

15:28.534 --> 15:30.000
No, I care how you
and the kids are.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.834
<i>How could you
let that woman
sell our Playboys?</i>

15:34.834 --> 15:37.033
I couldn't
stop her.

15:37.033 --> 15:39.968
You know, everybody
up there is laughing
at you.

15:39.968 --> 15:42.868
What do you mean,
everybody is
laughing at me?

15:42.868 --> 15:44.601
Is Abe Lincoln
laughing at me?

15:45.701 --> 15:47.334
Abe.

15:47.334 --> 15:48.367
Socrates.

15:49.434 --> 15:50.968

are laughing at me?

15:56.834 --> 15:58.767
What about...Marilyn Monroe?

15:58.767 --> 16:00.734
Is Marilyn laughing at me?

16:00.734 --> 16:03.234
She doesn't even know
you're alive.

16:06.934 --> 16:10.300
Look, Dad,
you're surrounded by
great minds up there.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.934
Doesn't anybody know
anything about women?

16:12.934 --> 16:13.934
Not a one.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.300
Well, Plato used to have
a few theories,

16:17.300 --> 16:20.667
but now he mostly just, uh...
takes young boys camping.

16:22.934 --> 16:24.801
Look, kid...

16:24.801 --> 16:27.033
nobody really
understands anything
about women.

16:27.033 --> 16:29.467
And nobody ever will.
But the one thing we know:

16:29.467 --> 16:33.567
They're the single greatest
problem facing the world today.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.667
They must be stopped.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.667
You must make a stand.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.133
We're counting on you, Son.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.868
Everybody in heaven
is counting on me?

16:44.868 --> 16:47.534
Yeah. See, we hid from
the women and had
a meeting.

16:49.868 --> 16:52.968
<i>We decided that you
have to get her to get
your Playboys back.</i>

16:52.968 --> 16:57.534
The dignity of all men...
is riding on you.

16:57.534 --> 16:58.901
Look at her, Dad.

16:58.901 --> 17:01.567
I can't even get her
to give me a piece of cheese.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.166
John Wayne thinks
that you can do it.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.067
The Duke?

17:08.067 --> 17:09.934
The Duke wants me
to do it?

17:11.334 --> 17:12.834
He's got a 5 spot
riding on you.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.000

But, Al...

17:46.467 --> 17:47.467
Now!

18:02.434 --> 18:03.968
Well, how am I gonna
get them?

18:03.968 --> 18:04.968
Don't care.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.834
<i>We want our Playboys!</i>

18:09.834 --> 18:11.901
We? Who's we?

18:11.901 --> 18:14.300
Me and all the guys.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.467
All except Plato.

18:21.934 --> 18:22.934
Okay.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.000
That felt good.
I feel the Duke in me.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.834
Young'uns,
get down here right now!

18:39.868 --> 18:40.868
What is it,
Dad?

18:40.868 --> 18:42.467
Want my car
washed, pronto.

18:47.601 --> 18:49.801
And you, little filly,

18:49.801 --> 18:52.133
you're gonna cook me up
a man-sized dinner.

[LAUGHING]

18:56.701 --> 18:58.033
What's with him?

18:58.033 --> 18:59.934
He's old
and confused.

19:02.501 --> 19:04.501
Okay, who wants
a Tangwich?

19:14.701 --> 19:16.868
We don't like the way
you make them, Daddy.

19:16.868 --> 19:18.534
We like the way
Mom makes them.

19:20.133 --> 19:22.868
She pinches the ends
so that the orange sand
doesn't run out.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.300
Fine.
More for me.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.000
When's Mom
coming home?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.467
When her task
is done. Why?

19:31.467 --> 19:34.234
Well, because when
we have a problem,
we like to ask Mom.

19:34.234 --> 19:36.100
What's the matter?
You can't learn from me?

19:43.801 --> 19:46.267
Listen...there's
nothing that you can
ask your mother

19:46.267 --> 19:47.968
you can't ask me.

19:47.968 --> 19:48.968
Go ahead. Shoot.

19:49.901 --> 19:52.033
Okay. Well...

19:52.033 --> 19:53.667
I'm ovulating...

19:55.133 --> 19:58.601
And when this happens,
I get this pinching
little cramp.

19:58.601 --> 20:00.000
What should I do?

20:02.100 --> 20:03.100
Walk it off.

20:06.734 --> 20:10.801
And remember,
the next time, stretch
before you...ovulate.

20:16.234 --> 20:17.601
Bud.

20:17.601 --> 20:20.000
Uh, no problems
here, Dad.

20:21.934 --> 20:23.167
Good.
That's good.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.534
Now, I must
parent some more.

20:25.534 --> 20:27.901
It's late. I want you both
to go straight to bed.

20:29.467 --> 20:30.567
Okay,
Daddy.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.801
Dad, you're not laughing
at me now, are you?

20:55.234 --> 20:57.434
<i>My Playboys!
My babies!</i>

20:57.434 --> 20:59.501
How did you
get them back?

20:59.501 --> 21:02.300
Well, I owe it all
to Tubro.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.300
See, we were driving around
in your car, when suddenly--

21:05.300 --> 21:08.100
Wait a second, Peg.
What were you doing in my car?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.767
Well, Tubro
thought it was best.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.267
Anyhow...so we're
driving around in your car,

21:13.267 --> 21:15.434
and I had no idea
how to get the money

21:15.434 --> 21:17.100
to get your magazines back.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.000
So I started to rub Tubro's
belly, and suddenly, it hit us.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.501
What? How to get
the money back?

21:22.501 --> 21:24.934
No, a Mercedes.

21:24.934 --> 21:27.467
Peg, a Mercedes
hit my car?

21:27.467 --> 21:31.067
Yeah. But don't worry.
I wasn't hurt. Ha-ha.

21:31.067 --> 21:33.868
Anyway, rather than going
through our insurance companies,

21:33.868 --> 21:36.100
the guy in the car
gave me enough money

21:36.100 --> 21:37.767
<i>to buy your Playboys back.</i>

21:37.767 --> 21:39.267
Aren't you proud of me?

21:39.267 --> 21:40.467
Well, wait a second,
Peg.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.033
How much damage
was done to my car?

21:42.033 --> 21:43.501
Oh...lots.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.234
But I'm pretty sure
you can still drive it.

21:47.234 --> 21:48.667
I just think
you'd better leave

21:48.667 --> 21:50.067
a little early for work
tomorrow.

21:50.067 --> 21:52.868
because your car doesn't
turn left anymore.

21:52.868 --> 21:55.367
But I don't think
you'd want to anyway,
because, you know,

21:55.367 --> 21:58.167
there's no door
on the side.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.701
Yeah, but
you're okay, right?

21:59.701 --> 22:01.534
Yeah.

22:01.534 --> 22:05.000
Ah, who cares
if you're okay, and I can
only drive clockwise.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.067
I don't care, because
I got my babies back.

22:09.067 --> 22:11.400
Look, Peg. Brandi Brandt.
Isn't she great?

22:11.400 --> 22:14.000
I don't see
what's so hot about her.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.300
Well, you will when she's
tacked up on the headboard.

22:22.968 --> 22:24.501
Upstairs!
Now!

22:24.501 --> 22:25.534
Oh ho ho!
