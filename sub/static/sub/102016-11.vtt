00:02.611 --> 00:04.961
[projector whirring][beeping]

00:06.441 --> 00:09.270
MAN:
Test 405-E commencing.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.059
On my mark.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.844
Three, two, one.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.378
That's impossible.

00:47.612 --> 00:50.528
Test 405-E is a total failure.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.879
The object remains sealed.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.534
Commencing Test 406-A.

00:56.578 --> 00:59.624
Using highly corrosive acid.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.539
We will find a way to open it.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.810
ALARIC:
Focus on your breathing.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.464
Relax.

01:13.508 --> 01:16.511
Just let the inspiration flow
out of you.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.822
Did it work?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.129
I mean, I don't want to speak
for the rest of the group,

01:26.173 --> 01:28.088
but I feel
the exact same.

01:28.131 --> 01:31.003
So...0 for 9, then.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.440
HOPE:
Good thing it's a big board.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.529
What's next?

01:34.572 --> 01:36.879
Perhaps muses cannot choose
whom they inspire.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.837
Or I am terrible
at being one.

01:38.881 --> 01:39.838
Either way,
we should stop.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.449
This is not working.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.015
When we find a way
to activate your powers...

01:43.059 --> 01:44.495
If.When.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.280
You will inspire us
to have something

01:46.323 --> 01:48.369
that we've never had in
our fight against Malivore.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.719
An advantage.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.112
That's the spirit.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.461
Now what's next?

01:53.504 --> 01:54.766
Uh...

01:54.810 --> 01:56.551
Mind meld.KALEB: Wow.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.814
Let me guess who came up
with that thunderbolt.

01:58.857 --> 02:03.079
As the only person who's
actually been inspired by Cleo,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.515
quit trying to force it.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.257
Just be natural.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.305
Ain't nothing natural
about that.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.307
It worked.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.309
I know how we defeat Malivore.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.137
We summon a time travel monster

02:17.180 --> 02:18.964
to send us back in time

02:19.008 --> 02:20.792
and stop him from being born.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.011
[scoffs]

02:23.447 --> 02:24.927
Where is Lizzie with the zinger
when you need her?

02:24.970 --> 02:27.669
She had a far greater duty
this morning.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.106
And I quote, she had
"a fashion emergency."

02:30.150 --> 02:31.586
Yeah, that's been going on
since the day we met, so...

02:31.629 --> 02:32.587
You know what?

02:32.630 --> 02:33.979
I think Jed's right.

02:34.589 --> 02:35.633
Yeah?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.592
Not about the time travel.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.681
Maybe we're going about this
all wrong.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.465
Instead of you trying
to inspire us,

02:41.509 --> 02:44.425
maybe you just need to focus
on what inspires you,

02:44.468 --> 02:46.688
like, uh, a song
or a work of art.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.864
Or a special someone.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.127
HOPE:
Great.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.694
If Kaleb's game is the
answer to our problems,

02:52.737 --> 02:53.999
then we're doomed.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.698
[chuckles]

02:56.741 --> 02:58.917
Whoa. Something just happened.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.268
Anyone have any brilliant ideas?

03:01.311 --> 03:03.226
Yeah.
Not you, Jed.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.229
Take that as a yes, Hope.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.144
More like a maybe.
I just need to do some research

03:08.188 --> 03:09.537
before I share with the group.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.973
But I can assure you,
it's completely safe

03:11.016 --> 03:13.062
and I won't even have
to leave school.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.585
Sweet. I love research.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.936
At least I potentially inspired
one person.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.156
Oh, make that two.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.114
I believe our monster problem's
connected to the artifact,

03:22.158 --> 03:24.639
which we know was
in Triad's possession.

03:24.682 --> 03:26.118
So maybe there's a clue

03:26.162 --> 03:28.512
in their records,
if they still exist,

03:28.556 --> 03:31.646
which would be at
their old headquarters.

03:31.689 --> 03:32.647
Naturally.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.257
It's all so clear now.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.824
Thank you, Cleo.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.392
Do not thank me
until you find what you seek.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.045
I would like to accompany you.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.351
And I'd like to accompany you.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.352
You.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.832
Um, because...

03:43.875 --> 03:45.529
my-my skill set
might come in handy

03:45.573 --> 03:47.183
if the mission goes sideways.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.793
The more the merrier.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.230
Let's go.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.972
[muttering]

03:54.016 --> 03:55.147
LANDON:
You mind sharing

03:55.191 --> 03:56.714
your actual plan with me?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.629
The prison world is bound
to The Necromancer.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.241
So what if we take a page
out of Kai Parker's playbook?

04:01.284 --> 04:02.938
Uh, that dude had
a lot of plays.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.635
Could you be
a little more specific?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.550
Well, if we sever
The Necromancer's ties to it,

04:06.594 --> 04:08.422
the prison world
will collapse.

04:08.465 --> 04:11.686
And destroys everything inside
of it, including Malivore.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.209
Got to admit,
it's pretty brilliant.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.689
Thank you. Can't take
all the credit.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.518
Now all we need to do

04:17.561 --> 04:20.129
is find our necrotic friend
and make him an offer.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.696
His blood and the duplicate
ascendant we need

04:21.739 --> 04:23.437
for the severing spell.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.222
And in exchange, I will free him
from the prison world.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.704
I take it back.
That's a terrible idea.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.358
Don't worry,
I'm gonna screw him over.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.621
I just need to
figure out how.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.667
I thought you told Dr. Saltzman
this was gonna be risk-free.It is.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.669
Hence the chalk.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.497
Astral projection.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.804
The Necromancer can see
different planes of existence,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.022
so he should be able to see

04:44.066 --> 04:45.328
but not touch, maim,
or kill you.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.069
Like I said, safe.In that case,

04:47.112 --> 04:48.331
I'm coming with you.Sorry.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.550
Not enough chalk.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.986
You just said it's safe.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.857
Besides, look at my résumé.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.469
I'm the only one here who's beat
The Necromancer in negotiation.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.471
Remember what the banshee said.Yeah.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.776
But we said screw fate,
remember?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.431
This is our chance
to actually do it.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.998
I, for one, can't think
of anything more romantic

05:03.041 --> 05:04.347
than strolling hand in hand

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
through a postapocalyptic
hellscape.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.356
[birds chirping]

05:14.401 --> 05:16.533
Maybe this wasn't
the best plan.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.622
Superheroes are supposed
to save people,

05:18.666 --> 05:20.407
not kidnap them.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.844
I should probably get
Dr. Saltzman down here.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.933
Though he'll ask
why we're

05:24.976 --> 05:26.369
keeping Finch out here
in the barn

05:26.413 --> 05:27.588
of the family
you're staying with.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.416
Wait, you haven't told him yet?

05:29.459 --> 05:30.939
Well, I was worried
if I told him

05:30.982 --> 05:32.549
I didn't compel
your memories away,

05:32.593 --> 05:35.378
our days of superhero team-up
would be over.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.162
Okay, look, I need you.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.426
Just put on your secret
identity, all right?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.732
Go to school and act normal

05:41.776 --> 05:44.082
while I deal with this.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.215
The Blur and E-man got
to take a day off.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.610
Fine.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.394
I will sign off
on laying low,

05:51.438 --> 05:53.788
but not the superhero names.What?

05:53.831 --> 05:55.920
Um, um, E...

05:55.964 --> 05:57.313
money?
Hmm.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.489
E-commerce?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.186
Right?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.058
I'll think of some better
ones in geometry class.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.151
Invisique saeclum.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.152
[gasps]

06:10.195 --> 06:11.675
Lizzie. How...

06:11.719 --> 06:13.329
How long have you...Long enough to know

06:13.373 --> 06:15.810
that you've been
playing dress-up with a muggle.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.339
Hello?

06:29.258 --> 06:32.043
I see it's business
as usual around here.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.177
[slow footsteps approaching]

06:50.366 --> 06:51.759
[grunts]

06:51.802 --> 06:52.847
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, it's me.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.197
Jo, Jo, look. It's me.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.459
Wade.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.374
[sighs]
Where is everyone?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.463
And what are you doing?
why are you dressed for battle?

07:00.507 --> 07:03.727
Well, Dr. S gave us
a three-day weekend.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.555
But I stayed behind
to defend the school

07:05.599 --> 07:08.079
in case the big M sends
another monster.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.299
What are you doing here?

07:10.342 --> 07:12.475
I thought you were Eat, Pray,
Loving with the townies now.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.695
I was just looking
for Lizzie.

07:14.738 --> 07:16.740
Things aren't exactly
panning out at my new school,

07:16.784 --> 07:18.176
and I kind of need some advice.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.482
Well, she left.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.310
I don't know where she went,

07:21.353 --> 07:24.052
but being the defender of
the school takes many forms.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.403
I'm a great listener
and my WIS score is 18.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.840
Why do you have this?

07:29.884 --> 07:32.756
And can I borrow it?Knock yourself out.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.584
I was just using it
as a stand-in

07:34.628 --> 07:36.804
for my wizard's focus crystal.

07:36.847 --> 07:39.023
Hey, you don't LARP, do you?

07:40.024 --> 07:42.070
I do not, but thank you.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.202
I think that this is
exactly what I need.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.511
MG:
Just give me
a chance to explain.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.644
I didn't want to lie
to your dad,

07:50.687 --> 07:53.473
but the only other choice
was wiping Ethan's mind.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.952
Okay, you can stop.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.476
I'm not here to bust up
your bromance.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.478
The truth is,
I need your help.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
Turns out Josie has
a serious crush

08:00.567 --> 08:02.264
on this she-wolf.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.879
You should probably
just be happy for her.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
That would be premature.

08:11.578 --> 08:15.407
Because Finch has obviously
already activated her curse.

08:15.451 --> 08:18.889
So she's killed someone.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.587
Maybe it was an accident?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.110
Or maybe...

08:22.153 --> 08:23.590
FINCH:
I didn't kill anyone.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.550
And I chain myself up
every full moon so I don't.You must have.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.944
It's half the requirement
to become a werewolf.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.685
The other half is genetic,

08:31.728 --> 08:34.862
so, like,
being able to do this...

08:34.905 --> 08:37.081
which means
that your parents

08:37.125 --> 08:38.692
or grandparents
were wolves, too.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.738
I always thought
I was the only one.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.306
I mean,
how do you even know that?

08:44.349 --> 08:47.091
And how did you make yourself
invisible last night?

08:47.135 --> 08:48.528
[sighs]

08:50.704 --> 08:52.401
Post tenebras spero lucem.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.581
I'm a witch.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.017
But I like to think
of myself

09:00.061 --> 09:03.020
as Josie's sister,
first and foremost.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.718
At least I know where Jo's
damage comes from now.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.895
Okay, my sister has terrible
taste in women as it is.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.549
But there's no way
that I'm letting her near

09:09.592 --> 09:10.941
a cold-blooded killer.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.464
MG:
Whoa.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.292
Easy, Lizzie.
We don't know that yet.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.598
I didn't kill anyone.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.514
Well, I'm gonna need you
to prove it.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.125
HOPE:
We both want the same thing.

09:21.169 --> 09:24.128
If you help us, we will
not only grant your freedom,

09:24.172 --> 09:26.391
but you will also get
the satisfaction of knowing

09:26.435 --> 09:27.567
that you were
directly responsible

09:27.610 --> 09:29.351
for Malivore's destruction.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.745
[as The Necromancer]:
How generous of you, Tribrid.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.095
But why should I believe
that you,

09:34.138 --> 09:37.054
my second most detestable enemy,

09:37.098 --> 09:38.578
would keep your end
of the bargain?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.145
HOPE:
Because seeing is believing.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.409
If you sever your ties, then
the world will become unstable.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.542
Holes will start
to open up.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.240
Doors-- all you have to do is
walk through one.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.155
You can be in control
of your own fate.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.809
Think he'll go for it, Landon?

09:52.853 --> 09:54.768
I am not Landon.

09:54.811 --> 09:58.989

of departed souls.

LANDON: I mean,
he's pretty unpredictable.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.173
You and Malivore
are literally

10:09.217 --> 10:10.784
the only two things
he's afraid of.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.133
So if he's been on the run
from the mud man,

10:12.176 --> 10:13.308
you have even more leverage.

10:13.351 --> 10:14.831
That's a ringing endorsement.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.616
Come on, what's the worst
that could happen?

10:16.659 --> 10:18.139
I mean, if he says no,
we just give him the finger

10:18.182 --> 10:19.531
and head back to our world.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.837

if he wants it.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.056

fashion sense anywhere.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.793
Wow. Something actually
killed The Necromancer.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.578
Guess this mission's
kind of a bust.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.711
Remember the last time
he died in this prison world?

11:08.755 --> 11:11.105
He's banished to this world,
so all we have to do is wait,

11:11.148 --> 11:12.236
and eventually he'll resurrect.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.847
Hopefully in one piece.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.066
I don't really feel like
playing Mr. Potato Head

11:16.110 --> 11:17.764

mini-date isn't over yet.

Malivore?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.480

12:33.448 --> 12:35.493
Huh. Looks like someone had

12:35.537 --> 12:37.713
a "going out of
supernatural business" sale.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.237
CLEO:
I think I gave you
an unhelpful idea.

12:40.281 --> 12:43.675
Perhaps I can inspire
a better one on the way home?

12:43.719 --> 12:45.286
Yeah, she's right.
Maybe we should head back.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.114
Maybe grab something
to eat on the way?

12:48.942 --> 12:50.508
ALARIC:No, you did
great, Cleo.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.902
This control panel,
it isn't just for lights.

12:52.946 --> 12:56.036
It also has listed
two fire suppression systems.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.516
One for in here...

12:58.560 --> 13:02.782
one for somewhere... else.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.873
I do not see a door.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.571
Uh-uh. I'm not
fighting a mummy again.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.316
We can find out what Triad
paid for paperclips

13:59.360 --> 14:01.405
in 1997.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.146
This is Triad's documentation

14:03.190 --> 14:05.888
on all their
supernatural objects.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.500
If they know anything about
the history of the artifact,

14:09.544 --> 14:11.459

So, you want to dig around
in my brain?

14:13.722 --> 14:15.767

Not exactly.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.335
Vampires have this ability.
It's called a "head dive."

We can be present
inside of your memories

14:20.381 --> 14:25.081

14:27.257 --> 14:28.519

do it anyway.

to tell you-know-who

14:31.261 --> 14:33.698

extracurriculars.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.831
You and Josie are twins, right?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.051
How'd you figure that out?

14:38.094 --> 14:39.617
Because you're the evil one.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.446
Do it.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.450
If this is what it takes
to prove I didn't kill anyone...

14:47.669 --> 14:49.889
...I'm in.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.891

How is this possible?

14:51.934 --> 14:54.023
I destroyed you with an ax.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.938
Silly girl.

14:55.982 --> 14:59.333
All this time I've been
hiding inside you,

14:59.376 --> 15:02.771
waiting for the perfect time
to escape.

15:02.814 --> 15:06.209
[laughs]
You are so gullible.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.995
No, I'm really just your
subconscious projection of me.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.824
Well, it's fair
that we have trust issues.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.609
So why don't you just drop
that tacky paperweight

15:14.652 --> 15:16.176
and see for yourself?

15:26.316 --> 15:28.144
See?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.320
I'm practically harmless.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.279
This thing must be
malfunctioning.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.281
I didn't want
to talk to you.

15:34.324 --> 15:35.673
And yet...

15:35.717 --> 15:37.588
[gasps]
...here I am.

15:37.632 --> 15:38.981

you must want

15:39.025 --> 15:41.070
to hear what I have to say.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.855
I mean, I do know all
of your weaknesses.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.075
And I know exactly
what's wrong with you.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.773
But if you really don't
want to talk to me,

15:48.817 --> 15:51.211
that should be pretty simple
to prove.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.648

Hmm. That's what I thought.

Think back to the day

16:01.221 --> 16:03.005
you first turned
into a werewolf.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.659
We'll start there.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.932
A hospital? That's weird.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.542

16:33.557 --> 16:36.996

to the first day she turned.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.519
I did.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.350
Just my imagination, or is
this thing staring right at us?

16:43.393 --> 16:45.308
That's impossible.
Nothing can see us

16:45.352 --> 16:47.006
or hear us or touch us, so...

16:50.313 --> 16:52.446

17:31.354 --> 17:32.834

17:32.877 --> 17:34.140
This mission doesn't
seem so safe anymore.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.750
We should go home.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.795

will probably revive soon.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.362

is getting worse by the second.

how many more of those

your opinion on my future.

of my romantic relationships

18:33.547 --> 18:34.765
are such disasters.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.245
And I answered that.

The problem is not
the relationships.

to have a relationship.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.799
while she dunks on monsters,
but-but sending me back

22:45.842 --> 22:47.627
was the magical equivalent
of "hold my purse."

22:47.670 --> 22:49.063
She was trying to protect you.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.151
Except this time, she's the one

22:50.194 --> 22:51.370
who's actually in trouble.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.632
JOSIE:
You want to help?

22:53.459 --> 22:54.938
We need to find out
what bit her.

22:54.982 --> 22:58.507
Except all of our monster
experts are MIA

22:58.551 --> 23:00.379
at the moment.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.163
All except one.

23:02.206 --> 23:04.252
WADE:
It's a Berbalang.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.733
Red necrotic eyes? Insatiable
appetite for dead flesh?

23:06.776 --> 23:08.299
Able to interact
with the astral plane?

23:08.343 --> 23:09.866
Classic Berbalang.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.259
What, you've actually heard
of this thing?

23:11.302 --> 23:12.695
[scoffs]
Heard of it?

23:12.739 --> 23:14.175
Yeah, I've crossed swords
with it

23:14.218 --> 23:15.742
and lived
to tell the tale twice.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.308
I've been gone a long time.

23:17.352 --> 23:18.875
Medium aberration,

23:18.919 --> 23:21.356
neutral evil,
plus five modifier...

23:21.400 --> 23:23.750
Wait, is this a D&D thing?

23:23.793 --> 23:25.491
Yeah, told you-- expert.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.319
If-- and that's a big one--

23:28.363 --> 23:31.061
D&D has its facts right,

23:31.105 --> 23:34.108
how does one go about curing
a Berbalang bite?

23:34.151 --> 23:35.762
Wait.

23:38.112 --> 23:40.157
It bitHope?

23:40.201 --> 23:41.594
Okay, forget D&D.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.030
According to Filipino legend,

23:43.073 --> 23:44.901
Berbalangs are
like living viruses.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.426
They replicate themselves
through physical contact.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.340
If you get bit by one,
it's only a matter of time

23:49.384 --> 23:51.342
before you turn into one.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.388
[Hope growling]

23:55.521 --> 23:57.740
Hope?

23:59.438 --> 24:00.743
Are you okay?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.138
[snarls]

24:05.531 --> 24:07.446
[growls][others shout]

24:13.539 --> 24:16.411
How could you two be hungry
at a time like this?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.675
Uh, guys, Hope-alang is
no-doubt coming for us

24:19.719 --> 24:22.025
and you're busy
hoarding my nugs?It's bait!

24:22.069 --> 24:24.506
Berbalangs eat dead flesh.
We can use this

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
to get her into the bunker.And trap her in there

24:26.552 --> 24:27.988
until we can figure out a way
to turn her back.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.819
Good idea-- does this
remind you of anything?

24:32.862 --> 24:34.734
What could this possibly
remind me of?

24:34.777 --> 24:36.518
Rulien's Keep. This is exactly

24:36.562 --> 24:38.302
how our guild trapped
that owlbear, remember?

24:38.346 --> 24:41.001
Our first 30-hour
marathon session?

24:41.044 --> 24:43.307
We got kidney stones
because we drank

24:43.351 --> 24:45.048
so many energy drinks,
but you wouldn't stop

24:45.092 --> 24:46.485
until the lich's
phylactery was destroyed.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.574
Right, right.
How could I forget?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.271
Sorry to interrupt
your war stories,

24:50.314 --> 24:52.229
but we need to pick up the pace
before Hope gets here.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.623
You don't know the half of it.
According to the lore, we only

24:54.667 --> 24:56.886
have one hour before Hope's
transformation is permanent.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.455
Then what if this doesn't work?

25:03.893 --> 25:05.547
Or what if it works too well?

25:08.202 --> 25:10.117
Is it weird that I still
find her attractive?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.162
[growls]

25:14.034 --> 25:15.688
Oh, hey, let me, um...

25:15.731 --> 25:17.994
I'm gonna check that
for you, okay?Uh...

25:20.606 --> 25:22.608
No mention of any artifacts
or anything,

25:22.651 --> 25:25.872
but I hope I saved you
a little bit of time.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.091
[chuckles]

25:29.353 --> 25:31.007
Um, so...

25:31.051 --> 25:33.140
check this, tonight,

25:33.183 --> 25:35.969
I was thinking,
you know, you, me,

25:36.012 --> 25:38.754
drinks at the Tap,
barbecue from The Pit Stop,

25:38.798 --> 25:41.235
and then moonlit dancing on
the roof of the old clocktower?

25:41.278 --> 25:44.717
That sounds fun, but I will
have to pass for now.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.719
Okay.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.024
Okay, message received.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.199
Got to up my game.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.506
That is not what I was saying.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.073
Well, then you're
gonna have to send

25:53.116 --> 25:54.901
some clearer signals, 'cause

25:54.944 --> 25:56.511
you clearly dig me.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.078
So what-what's up?

25:58.121 --> 25:59.558
What I got to do to get a date?

25:59.601 --> 26:01.821
Not this.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.910
I do not like it when you try

26:03.953 --> 26:06.129
to impress me or be cool.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.741
I want you
to drop the act.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.787
And be honest.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.878
Is that something
you are capable of?

26:25.018 --> 26:27.498
You'll never believe
what I found.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.196
LANDON:
Hope?

26:29.239 --> 26:30.676
Are you in there?

26:30.719 --> 26:33.548
[grunting]

26:33.592 --> 26:35.158
She's trying to talk, I think.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.333
Hope!

26:38.031 --> 26:39.423
This isn't you.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.991
Fight it!

26:42.035 --> 26:44.820
Also, faerie folk
cause indigestion.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.346
[sniffs]

26:54.656 --> 26:57.267
Landon... she wants you!

26:57.311 --> 26:59.530
Run!

27:01.620 --> 27:04.057
LIZZIE:
Everything's gonna be okay.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.582
I know that
must have been painful.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.367
Probably why you blocked
the memory, but

27:10.411 --> 27:13.675
at least now we know that you
didn't hurt anyone on purpose.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.459
Yeah, congratulations.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.200
You proved I'm a killer.

27:17.244 --> 27:20.247
Something I have to live with
for the rest of my life.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.515
There might be a way to fix it.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.951
You have a time travel spell?

27:28.995 --> 27:30.039
Not quite.

27:31.606 --> 27:34.087
But I know one that can put
memory blocks in place.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.700
It can make you forget what
happened with your grandpa and

27:38.744 --> 27:40.789
even all of today

27:40.833 --> 27:43.313
if you want.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.191
I have to remember
what my grandpa said.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.193
And I can't
trust anyone.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.412
I have to look out for myself.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.894
It's too bad.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.420
I really liked Josie.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.426
[door creaks open]

28:14.388 --> 28:16.564
Thought you didn't want
to talk to me.I don't.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.087
But this is Sanskrit.
I took one class on it

28:18.131 --> 28:19.567
last year,
but I've forgotten everything.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.004
Sorry, um, why should I care?

28:22.048 --> 28:24.267
Because I said I've forgotten.
I'm sure my subconscious hasn't.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.661
Again, why should I care?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.184
Because I do.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.665
Now you're starting to get it.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.319
It says...

28:32.362 --> 28:36.627
"to stop a person
from becoming a Berbalang,

28:36.671 --> 28:40.544
you need
a pearl-bladed weapon."

28:40.588 --> 28:42.503
Perfect. Dad has a dagger
like that in his study.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.287
He uses it to open bottles.Ah-ah-ah.

28:44.331 --> 28:45.941
Not so fast.

28:45.985 --> 28:49.205
The weapon needs to be imbued
with an enchantment.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.816
And there's
no witch here

28:50.859 --> 28:53.209
to cast a spell,
and Lizzie's not back yet

28:53.253 --> 28:55.777
and fae magic just won't cut it.I know what you're trying to do.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.388
I'm not gonna take back my magic
just so you take me over.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.651
For the last time,
I don't need to take over.

29:00.695 --> 29:04.046
Because I already live
in here.

29:04.090 --> 29:06.309
Well, you're about
to get evicted.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.398
[gasps]
There's the girl I know.

29:08.442 --> 29:11.314
The tough bitch that buried
the hatchet in me.

29:11.358 --> 29:15.275
The one that said that she was
both strong and good.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.625
But if you're

29:17.668 --> 29:19.540
so strong...

29:19.583 --> 29:21.585
why are you afraid
of your own power?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.805
And if you're so good,

29:23.849 --> 29:26.590
how can you let your friend
turn into a monster?

29:26.634 --> 29:28.027
[gasps]

29:29.463 --> 29:31.726
Ticktock, Jo.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.998
[Hope snarling]

29:45.000 --> 29:47.002
Okay, if you're gonna eat me,
can I at least

29:47.046 --> 29:48.308
talk to my girlfriend first?

29:48.351 --> 29:50.049
WADE:
Stand down!

29:50.092 --> 29:53.487
Stay your hand, ghoul.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.881
Or face the wrath of Fangsbane.

30:01.712 --> 30:04.759
Maybe not so much wrath,
more like a stern lecture.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.762
[grunts]

30:07.806 --> 30:09.851
I failed my saving throw.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.331
Okay, Hope?

30:11.374 --> 30:14.377
It's me.[Hope gasping]

30:14.421 --> 30:15.770
I know that you can hear me.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.032
That you're trying
to talk to me.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.729
Liar!

30:18.773 --> 30:22.342
JOSIE:
I didn't know
Berbalangs were so judgy.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.432
You want something to eat?

30:26.650 --> 30:28.348
Eat this.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.306
Ventus.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.012
Now that's
what I call a glow-up!

30:41.230 --> 30:42.884
You took your magic back.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.407
I had to, to enchant this.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.844
A plus two dagger.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.715
That should stop the process.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.499
If you stab her
in the heart.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.242
ALARIC:
This is what we were
looking for.

30:53.286 --> 30:56.593
These sketches of the artifact
date back to the Renaissance.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.160
You can tell all that
just by looking at it?

30:58.204 --> 31:00.771
Look at the signature.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.817
Leonardo da Vinci.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.253
He's the one
who made it.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.429
I th-- I think.

31:06.473 --> 31:07.909
I don't know, my Italian's
only good enough

31:07.953 --> 31:09.389
to order at a restaurant, but...

31:09.432 --> 31:11.260
[chuckles]
Good.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.914
So, guess we can
get out of here now?

31:12.958 --> 31:15.134
Hey, man, I thought
you were having fun.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.701
Yeah, yeah, I was, um...

31:17.745 --> 31:19.616
It's just...

31:19.660 --> 31:22.881
Ah, yeah... girl problems.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.580
The, uh, sound carries.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.452
Look, you probably don't want
advice from the old guy, but...

31:29.496 --> 31:31.280
I'm thinking maybe

31:31.324 --> 31:34.457
you should tell her why
you actually came on the trip.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.851
'Cause I like being around her?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.898
Are you sure that's
the only reason?

31:43.989 --> 31:45.860
Hold up, you smell that?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.818
Like... like
something's burning?

31:53.259 --> 31:54.477
The parchment!

31:57.828 --> 32:00.048
JOSIE:
There is no coming back
from this.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.397
[hisses]

32:01.441 --> 32:02.746
If we're wrong, Hope dies.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.358
Are we really willing
to risk stabbing her

32:05.401 --> 32:07.186
in the heart
based off of some board game?

32:07.229 --> 32:09.014
Technically,
it's a tabletop RPG.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.408
And technically,
I'll shut up.
If we don't,
she'll turn into

32:12.452 --> 32:14.628
one of those things forever,
and that's the real risk.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.195
[screeches, growls]

32:17.718 --> 32:20.939
As defender of the school,
the lot falls to me.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.897
But I'm only acting
in that capacity
because the real protector

32:22.941 --> 32:24.943
of the school
is currently a monster.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.770
[growls]I'm scared.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.470
We all know how much
Hope means to this place.

32:30.513 --> 32:31.950
To all of us.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.213
[huffs]

32:35.301 --> 32:37.825
Landon. Landon, wait!

32:42.351 --> 32:43.962
[inhales softly]

32:44.005 --> 32:45.398
[exhales]

32:45.441 --> 32:46.790
[dagger clatters to floor]

32:50.881 --> 32:52.274
Come on, Hope.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.407
Come back to me.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.671
[faint groaning]

32:57.714 --> 32:59.151
[moans softly]

33:01.631 --> 33:04.025
Worst date ever.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.809
[chuckles]

33:19.040 --> 33:22.304
Well, that was
a fun car ride.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.045
Um...

33:25.090 --> 33:28.484
You two should
get some rest.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.269
KALEB:
Um, I'm about to grab a bite.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.140
Oh. So you cantalk.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.968
From how quiet the car ride was,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.057
I thought you were incapable
of speech.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.626
[exhales][scoffs]

33:39.669 --> 33:41.367
You're-you're right.

33:41.410 --> 33:44.022
Okay? It's not
easy for me

33:44.065 --> 33:45.980
to be vulnerable.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.590
Like admitting

33:47.634 --> 33:51.855

I went on the mission.

I wanted...
I wanted to have your back,

33:55.990 --> 33:59.602
in case Malivore sent
another monster after you.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.041
You are worried about me?

34:05.565 --> 34:08.263
That is actually very sweet
of you, Kaleb.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.004
Thank you
for being honest with me.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.702
You're welcome.

34:12.746 --> 34:15.009
I'm sorry it took so long.

Just, the
last time

34:16.967 --> 34:21.363
I was vulnerable with someone...

34:21.407 --> 34:23.887
I ended up dead.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.629
Craving blood.

34:29.110 --> 34:32.635
You became a vampire.

Yeah, it's... it's a long story.

I'm sure I'll tell you
about it sometime.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.466

You were great today.

35:03.927 --> 35:06.016
So great that you kicked me out
of the prison world

35:06.060 --> 35:07.801
the moment things
got dangerous?

35:07.844 --> 35:10.369
I want you to feel like
you can count on me--

35:10.412 --> 35:13.154
not just when it's safe,
but when there's trouble.I do.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.852
Landon, I sent you away so that
I could handle the mission,

35:15.896 --> 35:18.681
but I knew that you were able to
figure out what the monster was.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.554

35:46.274 --> 35:48.407
Did The Necromancer
ever revive?No.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.757
I'm not sure what it means.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.194

Cleo inspire a new plan.

I'm really glad
that you were here today.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.881
Not just because
you prevented me

39:21.924 --> 39:24.753
from turning into a Babadook
or whatever,

39:24.797 --> 39:27.495
but because I wanted
to apologize.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.236
Today was
the second time

39:29.279 --> 39:30.890
that I've put you
in a position

39:30.933 --> 39:33.022
to where you felt pressured
to take your magic back.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.024

you turning into a monster

You were with me
when I defeated my dark side.

And when it was over, I was so
horrified by what I had done

39:43.990 --> 39:45.208
that I just really wanted
to make sure

39:45.252 --> 39:46.514
that it never happened again.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.864

was kind of like

39:48.908 --> 39:50.736
letting the dark
part of me win.

always going to be with me,

from that anymore.

pretty perfect.

Well, not as a DM.

Please don't make me ask.Dungeon Master.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.474
Look, this
is gonna sound weird,

40:33.518 --> 40:35.520
but earlier today he forgot
about our D&D campaign

40:35.563 --> 40:37.478
to Rulien's Keep.

40:37.522 --> 40:40.786
Which isn't a biggie, except
that was his favorite module.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.657
And then there's
the Berbalang.

40:42.701 --> 40:45.791
It only eats dead flesh,
but it was hankering for Landon.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.836
Could just be
a residual phoenix...

40:47.880 --> 40:49.490

a balanced part

they hate fire.

40:52.014 --> 40:54.756
But the thing that
really got me, Hope,

40:54.800 --> 40:57.890
was that he stabbed you
in the heart

40:57.933 --> 41:00.675
after you called him a liar...

41:00.719 --> 41:02.111
He didn't have
a choice, okay?

41:02.155 --> 41:03.548
I would have done
the same thing.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.593
Yeah, but Landon wouldn't.

41:05.637 --> 41:08.030
He would never hurt
you, Hope. Ever.

There's something wrong
with him.
