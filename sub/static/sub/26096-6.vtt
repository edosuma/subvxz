WEBVTT

00:10.051 --> 00:11.970
Come on. Where are you?

00:12.053 --> 00:13.805
Give me a little meow for help.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.725
Dude, this day has just gone
from bad to worse.

00:16.808 --> 00:20.020
I wanted Cat to go in the litter box,
not a moving box.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.312
Ricardo, please tell me

00:21.396 --> 00:23.898
there's at least a little chance
you won't have to move again?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.775
My dad says it's fifty-fifty.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.402
So based on family history,

00:27.485 --> 00:29.904
I'll be halfway across the country
by Thursday.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.782
Cat, you can sleep
in the strangest places.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.992
Meow!

00:35.577 --> 00:37.746
I bet your day's
been less stressful than mine, Jake.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.373
I wouldn't exactly say that.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.459
I'm meeting my dad for lunch,

00:42.751 --> 00:43.752
at his office.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.546
<i>In Rook Tower? You can't do that!</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:48.423
I have to.
My dad says it's super important.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.842
-There's something he wants to tell me.
-[disconnects line]

01:01.770 --> 01:04.272
[gasps] Ah...

01:11.488 --> 01:12.530
[gasps]

01:14.866 --> 01:15.950
-Jake?
-[gasps]

01:17.077 --> 01:19.037
Oh, hey, Dad. Just double knotting.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.998
35 percent of all workplace accidents
are due to loose shoelaces.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.418
-But aren't those shoes slip-on?
-You can't be too careful.

01:26.044 --> 01:27.629
We're ordering sushi for lunch.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.672
Sushi?
Did you win the lottery or something?

01:29.964 --> 01:31.591
Practically. I got a new promotion.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.968
I'll be working directly
under Jonathan Rook

01:34.052 --> 01:36.471
on a top secret program
known as Project X.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.682
Wow! I'm really proud of you, Dad.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.975
Just goes to show you,

01:41.059 --> 01:43.353
hard work and determination
makes all the difference.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.855
Mark, how's my new project leader?

01:46.147 --> 01:48.566
Excellent, sir.
Let me introduce you to my son, Jake.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.984
Jonathan Rook.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.071

I'm sure I'd remember that.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.571
Pleased to meet you, Jake.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.241
If you're anything like your dad,
I'm sure I'll be a big fan of yours.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.243
Jake's a straight-A student
at the Academy.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.329
I bet he'd make a great
Rook Unlimited employee someday.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.998
The Academy of Future Leadership?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.958
Great school. I happen to fund it.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.669
I know. I've seen your portrait
in the auditorium,

02:49.752 --> 02:51.421
the computer lab, and in the men's room.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.506
Tell you what, since you're family here,

02:53.590 --> 02:56.050
you should come
to the Rook Unlimited Technology Showcase.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.469
Very exclusive, invite-only affair.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.014
We'll be unveiling
our biggest projects for next year.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.726
If you like experimental scientific
breakthroughs or mini hot dogs,

03:05.018 --> 03:06.769
there's no place better.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.313
And bring some of your school buddies.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.648
I'm always happy
to support future leaders.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.109
That sounds like a great idea.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.653
It sounds like a terrible idea.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.947
Seriously.
We'd be right under Rook's nose.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.073
He'd catch us for sure.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.784
Then show us his dungeon.
Which I'm still convinced he has.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.871
You will go. And not only you four,
take Erika as well.

03:25.663 --> 03:29.834
Rook still has the InfoGem that contains
the Flex DNA of all three of you.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.754
And I've been able to determine
that his new Project X

03:32.837 --> 03:35.006
is using the InfoGem in its set-up.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.633
For what, I'm not yet certain.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.718
I'm all for snagging the InfoGem,

03:38.801 --> 03:41.387
but let's do it as the Flex Fighters,
not as us.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.555
As the Flex Fighters,

03:42.639 --> 03:45.433
you tried to get the InfoGem
from Mechanica but failed.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.602
This is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.856
You can erase the data on the InfoGem,
while looking like five harmless students.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.610
Sneaking into my own dad's lab?
That's a little close to home.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.111
I know this isn't ideal.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.490
But keep a low profile,
and no one will be the wiser.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.332
Like anything
with the Rook Unlimited logo on it,

04:09.415 --> 04:11.918
I can promise you,
our new line of products

04:12.001 --> 04:13.211
will change the future.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.964
And if our time machine division
is successful,

04:16.047 --> 04:18.216
we'll change the past, too.
[laughs]

04:18.299 --> 04:20.134
I'm only kidding about that.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.594
-Maybe.
-[audience laughs]

04:25.598 --> 04:27.183
I can't believe how two-faced Rook is.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.311
How can he pretend to be so nice
when he's secretly Stretch Monster?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.396
Huh?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.150
This is wonderful, Dad.
Rook's a great speaker. He's the best.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.863
-Two-faced, huh?
-It's different when I do it.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.157
Kane. Dead ahead. Scatter.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.247
[giggles]

04:54.002 --> 04:55.795
Maybe we should get something to eat.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.464
-Are my palms sweaty?
-No.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.719
Pea puree crostini...?
[gasps]

05:06.431 --> 05:07.932
I am aghast!

05:08.016 --> 05:10.685
Gabe, fancy seeing you here.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.439
Erika, you surprise me.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.649
Through the prowess
of my stage combat skills,

05:16.733 --> 05:19.986
I have clearly proven that Nathan
is a lesser suitor than myself.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.448
There's more to being a man
than stage combat.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.950
Oh, is there?
Tell that to Archibald Thrust,

05:26.034 --> 05:29.203
president of the Royal Academy
of Faux Fighting.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.456
No crostini for you.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.707
Huh!

05:36.252 --> 05:38.463
If we're going to make it
into my dad's lab,

05:38.546 --> 05:40.339
first we're going to need
a big distraction.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.968
Like a smoke bomb or someone
faking a severe allergic reaction.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.096
Then we'll swipe the key card
from an unwitting security guard.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.141
But we'll still need to get past
the blast doors with the retinal scan.

05:50.224 --> 05:53.311
Are you prepared to climb through
some very tight air ducts?

05:53.561 --> 05:56.814
Always. But your plan might not be
the most efficient.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.483
I can't see any other way.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.488
Hi, Mr. Armstrong.
Any chance you could show us your new lab?

06:03.571 --> 06:04.989
I'd love to.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.163
The smoke bomb would have worked, too.

06:12.955 --> 06:13.956
[swish open]

06:21.839 --> 06:23.591
Very high security.

06:23.674 --> 06:24.675
[chirrups]

06:27.220 --> 06:30.515
Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong,
Your Honor's Lordship, sir.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.975
Uh. Mortar, not today of all days.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.771
Oh, I know, but, my idiot lab partner
thought a mega-super adhesive pellet

06:36.854 --> 06:39.607
was a square of strawberry taffy,
and ate it.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.276
When is Brick going to learn

06:42.360 --> 06:45.029
not to put random science experiments
into his mouth?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.697
Normally I'd be happy
for some peace and quiet,

06:46.781 --> 06:49.075
but we're about to present our paper
on dimensional gateway theory

06:49.158 --> 06:50.785
in front of the mayor and everybody.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.204
Is there a way to dissolve it
so I don't have to break his teeth?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.998
Which, I kind of want to do,
but could be counter-productive.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.542
I'll check with the R&D Department.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.086
Jake, you go ahead.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.385
He literally gave us a pass to the lab.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.054
This is the easiest
top secret mission of all time.

07:19.313 --> 07:23.109
-What horrible creation is this?
-Hand sanitizer.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.946
A piece of Multi-Farious?
This brings back a lot of memories.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.156
Mostly bad ones.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.657
I found the InfoGem.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.411
This should wipe all your Flex data clean.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.288
[chirrups and beeps]

07:35.788 --> 07:37.039
[beeps]

07:38.291 --> 07:39.417
Now let's get out of here.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.212
That will be the last time
I lose face before my beloved.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.548
Erika will not be able to resist me

07:45.631 --> 07:49.719
after I publicly humiliate you
with this paint gun.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.304
That's not paint.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.513
-Don't be stupid.
-[gasps]

07:53.014 --> 07:54.015
[squelches]

07:55.558 --> 07:59.061
This is exactly
why I did not fall in love with you.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.149
Do not deny
your attraction to me right now.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.318
[crackles]

08:09.280 --> 08:10.281
Whoa!

08:14.202 --> 08:15.203

08:35.598 --> 08:37.391
Guys? Where are you?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.686
[loud roar]

08:50.988 --> 08:51.989
[background music plays]

08:55.535 --> 08:56.536
[roars]

08:57.537 --> 08:59.789
-Not this again.
-[screaming]

09:03.084 --> 09:06.128
Oh, no! Jake! What have I done?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.593
Jake? Jake?

09:14.512 --> 09:15.638
Erika!

09:16.389 --> 09:17.765
Where's Jake? Is everyone okay?

09:17.848 --> 09:21.310
The debris split us up
but I think they're probably fine.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.395
[low growl]

09:32.196 --> 09:33.197
[growls]

09:39.996 --> 09:42.248
So a piece of the old Multi-Farious
hit Gabe,

09:42.331 --> 09:44.208
and now he's Gabe-Farious or something.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.627
Let's stop him before he divides
into a zillion pieces

09:46.711 --> 09:47.878
like the original did.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.926
Or just ignore my idea.

09:55.970 --> 09:56.971
[growls]

09:59.181 --> 10:00.182
[people scream]

10:03.936 --> 10:05.104
It's horrible!

10:05.187 --> 10:06.814
You think I'm disgusting?

10:06.897 --> 10:10.192
Look at what you're husband
is wearing, plaid.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.902
Deviled eggs! Deviled eggs! Deviled Eggs!

10:16.991 --> 10:19.076
This is triggering my jitters.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.246
Why are they acting so differently?

10:22.330 --> 10:25.499
No idea! But Flexarium
affected each of us a little different.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.211
Maybe Multi-Farious plus Gabe
equals not just split mass,

10:29.295 --> 10:31.464
but split personalities, too!

10:31.964 --> 10:35.259
Now I realize
just how many sides of Gabe I don't like.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.263
We need to stop Multi-Farious. Flank the--

10:39.430 --> 10:42.600
We can stop Multi-Farious later,
get the Flex Fighters.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.437
Change of plans.
All units, on the Flex Fighters.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.819
Really? Can't a hero
just save the day anymore?

10:58.824 --> 10:59.825
[low growl]

11:02.787 --> 11:05.289
Guys, we really left a pretty big mess.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.874
Whoa!

11:13.005 --> 11:14.090
Find them!

11:18.427 --> 11:19.845
Erika? Any sign of them?

11:21.847 --> 11:23.391
Oh, just found them!

11:23.974 --> 11:25.267
-Son!
-Dad!

11:25.351 --> 11:26.769
We were trapped behind a wall.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.396
-Are you limping?
-It's nothing.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.022
Just a twisted ankle or something.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.941
I am so sorry.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.568
I put you in danger by sending you
into the lab on your own.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.863
-I never should have done this.
-It's okay, Dad. Really.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.660
-[Jake] I'm seriously feeling fine.
-Let's not push it.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.663
Chicken noodle soup and video games
all day until you're better.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.916
Not all day, right. I can't miss cello.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.544
Wrong. I've cancelled all your activities.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.004
That actually sounds awesome.
But not today,

11:54.088 --> 11:57.550
because I've got the egg drop
for Science Club to finish.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.885
That can wait. You need to heal.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.640
<i>-He gone?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

12:04.723 --> 12:06.767
I've been dying for my dad
to let me have a day off

12:06.851 --> 12:08.144
and he finally gives me one--

12:08.310 --> 12:10.688
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was have a building collapse on you.</i>

12:10.771 --> 12:13.858
<i>-Should have thought of that earlier.</i>
-But I can't even enjoy this.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.652
Not when there's a Multi-Farious
out there wreaking havoc.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.864
There can't be that much havoc wreaking
or it'd be on the news.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.074
You think he just... went away?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.826
[female] Dinner time.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.830
-How much of that green goop got on you?
-It was a fair amount of goop.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.166
But, don't worry, I'm totally fine.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.543
If it starts to affect you at all--

12:32.710 --> 12:34.628
Nathan, you're so sweet to worry.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.797
But it's cool, I'm all good.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.677
I'm so upset
Ricardo may have to move again.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.803
Such a shame.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.556
Yeah. It's a total bummer.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.687
I really hope
he gets to stay in Charter City.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.105
He's practically family.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.367
You can come out. We won't hurt you.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.081
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me.
The other parts of me hate you.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.459
-We don't hate you.
-Speak for yourself.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.211
Nathan, be nice.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.672
Everyone has a sensitive side. Even Gabe.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.425
We're all just sad
that Erika doesn't like us.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.843
But I understand why.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.762
You're more genuine than normal Gabe.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.805
He never shows my side of his personality.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.059
He hides me. Like, I embarrass him.

13:30.142 --> 13:35.231
Er, I didn't even know he had a...
you side of his personality.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.191
Well, but that's not why I'm here.

13:37.274 --> 13:40.569
I was hoping maybe you could help me
find the Flex Fighters.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.114
They need to stop the other pieces of me
like they did the old Multi-Farious.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.991
Do you have any idea
how to get in touch with them?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.244
I might have an idea.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.373
<i>That's Gabe's sensitive side?</i>

13:52.456 --> 13:56.252
<i>I would have expected him</i>
<i>to be a lot smaller. Like microscopic.</i>

13:56.460 --> 13:57.878
I need you guys to get here.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.381
He can lead us
to the rest of the Gabe-Farious pieces.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.634
<i>Easier said than done.</i>
<i>I'm basically under house arrest.</i>

14:03.717 --> 14:05.052
<i>If my dad finds out I'm gone,</i>

14:05.135 --> 14:07.763
<i>I'll be in actual need</i>
<i>of medical attention.</i>

14:08.806 --> 14:09.848
<i>Amateur.</i>

14:14.895 --> 14:16.146
Blindstrike?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.365
My dad might have some doubts.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.450
Considering I'm not
a magician's assistant.

14:31.328 --> 14:35.124
As long as your dad doesn't get too close,
this hologram will completely fool him.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.335
-Impressive.
-Works flawlessly.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.754
I've never actually set foot
in a single Leadership Class.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.340
Because you were on missions for Dr. C?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.426
Er, yeah.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.767
Oh, be careful, Nathan.
There's a really big step ahead.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.520
-I don't want you hurting yourself.
-Thanks.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.190
Yeah, a regular kid like you
should be extra cautious.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.693
I seem to remember
you're not good with heights.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.029
Are you going to be okay
with that ladder ahead?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.659
[chirrups and beeps]]

15:13.245 --> 15:14.455
What are you doing?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.124
Dr. C's back in the lab,
developing a cure,

15:17.207 --> 15:18.709
injecting it into Gabe Prime

15:18.792 --> 15:20.878
will be the only way
to reverse what happened to him.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.550
This way. They should be just ahead.

15:30.846 --> 15:31.805
Where are they?

15:31.889 --> 15:34.141
This is where my heart
told me they would be.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.602
I think your heart
should learn how to read a map.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.562
Because unless we're here
to make a sand castle,

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
we're in the wrong place.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.607
<i>Important data, Flex Fighters.</i>

15:41.690 --> 15:43.817
<i>I just studied the samples</i>
<i>Blindstrike sent,</i>

15:43.901 --> 15:46.695
<i>whatever chemicals caused Gabe</i>
<i>to become the new Multi-Farious</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:47.905
<i>have made him unstable.</i>

15:48.072 --> 15:51.909
<i>If I'm correct, this Multi-Farious will</i>
<i>eventually grow volatile and explode.</i>

15:51.992 --> 15:54.954
If it's okay with all of you,
I'd rather not explode.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.914
Doesn't sound like fun. For me, at least.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.626
<i>Every time Multi-Farious divides,</i>
<i>he becomes more unstable.</i>

16:00.709 --> 16:03.545
<i>So as long as he hasn't divided</i>
<i>into more than four pieces,</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:05.339
<i>we have plenty of time to cure him.</i>

16:05.422 --> 16:06.924
Look, there they are.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.717
And there they are.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.928
And there they are.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.851
[all yell]

16:17.935 --> 16:19.395
The Flex Fighters.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.648
It's like a tidal wave of attitude.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.699
[all yell]

16:38.580 --> 16:40.457
We need to find the prime Gabe.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.960
But this time they all have
the exact same eye color.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.879
We probably have to find the one
with the most pure Gabe personality,

16:45.963 --> 16:47.214
that's got to be his prime self.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.717
Sounds right to me. Just one problem.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.886
-What is Gabe's prime personality?
-I don't know.

16:52.970 --> 16:57.266
And the sun burns white hot!
Alas, the hunter's horn---

16:57.349 --> 17:03.022
To be or not to be, that is the question.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.106
[audience mutters]

17:08.736 --> 17:09.945
[grunts]

17:10.988 --> 17:11.989
[glass shatters]

17:14.742 --> 17:17.244
That is not regulation play!

17:18.704 --> 17:19.705
Ow!

17:24.877 --> 17:25.878
[strums]

17:28.589 --> 17:29.590
[sobs]

17:37.473 --> 17:38.474
[squeaks and pops]

17:40.142 --> 17:41.143
[yells]

17:47.024 --> 17:48.025
[laughs]

17:56.325 --> 17:59.369
Yeah, I'd be shaking too if I were you.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.913
<i>He's not shaking with fear.</i>

18:00.996 --> 18:03.040
<i>The Multi-Fariouses</i>
<i>are growing more volatile</i>

18:03.123 --> 18:04.124
<i>and will soon explode.</i>

18:04.416 --> 18:06.210
If they all explode at the same time,

18:06.293 --> 18:08.670
it won't just be bad for Gabe,
it will destroy the city.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.380
<i>I've finally generated a cure,</i>

18:10.464 --> 18:12.674
<i>Blindstrike,</i>
<i>return at once to retrieve it.</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:16.095
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.139
[grunts]

18:19.848 --> 18:21.058
[grunts]

18:22.643 --> 18:24.686
Omni-Mass. I can't just watch!

18:28.065 --> 18:30.442
Nathan Park is Wingspan?

18:37.574 --> 18:38.575
[muffled cries]

18:40.577 --> 18:41.662
Huh?

18:42.579 --> 18:47.793
Sweet smell of garbage,
what dump have you come from now?

18:48.293 --> 18:51.088
Oh, no. It's just you.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.631
Insulting Haikus?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.342
That jerk has to be prime Gabe.
Get the cure ready.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.680
[air hisses]

19:02.474 --> 19:04.726
It didn't work. That wasn't the prime.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.437
Try this one. He's a pretentious actor!

19:07.521 --> 19:08.522
It's gotta be him.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.941
-[gasps]
-[air hisses]

19:12.609 --> 19:14.570
That didn't work either!

19:14.987 --> 19:16.780
-We're running out of time.
-And serum.

19:16.947 --> 19:20.033
Hold on!
This is crazy, but I have a theory.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.829
Wingspan, what are you doing?!

19:23.912 --> 19:27.040
There's no way the real Gabe
is sensitive and compassionate!

19:27.124 --> 19:29.001
But maybe we've got him all wrong.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.127
Ah... Ah...

19:30.210 --> 19:32.171
-[air hisses]
-[gentle sobs]

19:33.505 --> 19:35.757
Told you! You wasted the cure.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
[loud rumble]

19:56.570 --> 19:58.822
What am I doing with you weirdos?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.949
You don't remember anything?

20:01.033 --> 20:05.621
Last thing I recall is not serving
pea crostini to a loser named Nathan.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.997
He didn't deserve any.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.834
Well, the cure definitely worked.
That's Gabe alright.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.172
[sighs] Of course I'm Gabe.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
How did you know it was him?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.887
Erika said everyone has a sensitive side.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.140
When the other's didn't work,
I started to wonder if the nice Gabe

20:25.224 --> 20:28.143
was the real Gabe he keeps hidden,
looks like it was.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.606
Huh. We're not the only ones hiding
our true selves, are we?

20:32.689 --> 20:33.690
[siren approaches]

20:35.484 --> 20:37.110
And that's our cue to bolt.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.623
Ah!

20:56.213 --> 20:57.381
Hey, son. How you feeling?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.174
Totally fine. All better.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.386
[Dad] I know I can be overprotective.
But I'm glad you're safe.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.099
<i>It's official.</i>

21:07.182 --> 21:09.393
<i>Word just came in.</i>
<i>We're moving next week.</i>

21:09.476 --> 21:11.103
Then I should get to packing.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.356
<i>I know this is tough. You okay?</i>

21:14.523 --> 21:16.483
-I'm fine.
-[disconnects line]

21:18.735 --> 21:20.028
<i>There's nothing you can do?</i>

21:20.279 --> 21:23.657
<i>Nope. That's what I get for thinking</i>
<i>I finally belonged somewhere.</i>

21:23.740 --> 21:26.660
<i>The only thing that's constant</i>
<i>in this world is change.</i>
