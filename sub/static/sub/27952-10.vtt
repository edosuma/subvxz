In here, Papito.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.353
I would have rather walked in
on you two doing it.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.731
Ay, cochino!

00:22.814 --> 00:26.109
You know, I have it on my bucket list
to paint a masterpiece.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.070
Oh, I can't wait to see how I look!

00:29.362 --> 00:30.196
Okay.

00:34.034 --> 00:34.909
Wow.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.246
You've really captured my essence.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.248
[door opens]

00:40.331 --> 00:42.792
Oh, my God! You're so frustrating.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.794
-I'm teaching you to drive.
-No!

00:44.878 --> 00:47.756
You're watching me parallel park
and screaming, "We're all gonna die!"

00:48.798 --> 00:50.216
That's teaching you to drive.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.053
You don't even make sense
half of the time.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.972
You told me to hurry up and slow down.
Which one is it?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.058
It's both. That's why you're not ready.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.644
Ooh, you really captured his essence.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.148
Anyway, I ain't got no money
for driving school.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.357
So you're stuck with me,

01:06.441 --> 01:08.735
unless you can find
a sucker with nothing better to do

01:08.818 --> 01:10.236
than get behind the wheel with you.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.529
[snaps] I'll do it.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.951
-Really?
-Yes, I'd love to,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.287
and I have a spotless driving record.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.580
[Lydia] It is true.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.248
Leslie drives like an old lady.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.044
I mean, I assume.
I don't know what old ladies do.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.923
Wow, Dr. B, this would really help me out.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.884
And my boards are coming up,
and this is really stressing me out.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.512
Elena, this is going to be such fun.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.973
My father taught me
using his patented 30-point system.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.183
Thirty points?

01:40.266 --> 01:42.310
Agreed. Inadequate.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.774
So I have updated it
to the 42-point system.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.027
I figure two hours per point,
you'll be driving by Passover.

01:53.071 --> 01:57.158
So... we're gonna be
in a car together for 84 hours.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.162

into the car until hour 12.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.385
now that Leslie is teaching Elena
how to drive.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.430
Mami, I don't even have time to tell you
that I don't have time.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.601
Lupita, I have two great legacies:

03:47.101 --> 03:52.982
my family recipes and a neckline
that almost capsized a Carnival Cruise.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.905
Mami, just write the recipes down,
then we can have them forever.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.740
I cannot do that.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.492
My sister, Mirtha, will break in,

04:02.575 --> 04:04.410

I promise you, one day we will,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.351
I'm sure I will live forever.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.984
I will simply write a new list.

for teaching me how to drive.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.601
Oh, I have lots of time.

-What show?
-No, all of Netflix.

I'm just glad to be doing this
with anybody but my mom.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.489

and criticizing my every move.

I'm on my way to therapy.

Okay, sweetie, but make sure to call
if you'll be late for dinner.

It's like I don't want to know,
but also I do.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.690
Hey, your mom wanted to pass down
her family recipes to someone worthy.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.525
So she's teaching me everything.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.278

06:41.943 --> 06:43.986
that you buy each ingredient
in a different store

can't reconstruct the recipe.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.609

09:45.543 --> 09:47.628
She has no sympathy for how busy I am.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.007
She could just write
the recipes down, but no.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.259
She's too afraid her 60-year-old sister

09:53.342 --> 09:57.305

overcame all her religious objections

Oh, it's my daughter.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.016
[automated voice]
Hey, Leslie, I need money.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.477
Call me when you send it.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.563
Neutral face emoji.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.942
I'm jazzed at how upbeat she sounds.

12:15.651 --> 12:16.485
Really?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.238
Oh, this is huge.
She wants me to call her.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.616
[automated voice]
Actually, don't call. Just send money.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.494
I love... Venmo.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.752
I'm sorry she only hits you up for money.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.878
No, it's okay, Elena.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.588
Truth is I blame myself.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.050
Between med school, and residency,
and hospital rotations,

12:40.134 --> 12:42.303
I wasn't around much when she was a kid.

12:43.387 --> 12:47.183
And I would love it if we could just get
to the point where Rachel would ask me

12:47.266 --> 12:49.935
how I was doing
before she asked me for money,

12:50.019 --> 12:52.855
but there's too much water
under the bridge.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.774
[automated voice]
Just checked my account.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.525
Still no money.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.278
So sick of this. Poop emoji.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.531
Okay.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.034

Hey, now that I'm officially
a member of la familia,

13:21.675 --> 13:24.470
maybe I could add something
to the Alvarez Family Museum.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.348
Oh, it's very exclusive.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.558
It has to be a report card,

13:29.642 --> 13:33.896
or a trophy,
or any tooth from Alex's mouth.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.361
My eight-year sobriety chip.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.157
It would be my honor.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.914
Oh.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.082
[laughs]

13:57.753 --> 14:01.465
Ironically, the only other Wall of Fame
I've been on was my favorite bar,

14:01.549 --> 14:04.134
Tom Bergin's, for inventing
something called the tequila bong.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.136
-What is that?
-I do not remember.

14:08.264 --> 14:12.017
Anyway... I thought staying sober
these last eight years

14:12.101 --> 14:14.687
was my greatest accomplishment
until today...

14:15.855 --> 14:18.232
when I became an official member
of this family.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.860

14:21.902 --> 14:24.780
Okay, viejita, you win.
I would love to learn your recipes.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.073
Get out of my house.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.416
Blinker on.
Check in the mirror. All clear.

14:35.499 --> 14:39.420

14:49.680 --> 14:51.265
Where the hell are we?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.645
We... have arrived
at your final destination.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.856
Rachel's house.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.192
Wow.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.572
I paid for it,
but I've never seen it before.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.575
How did you know where to go?

15:09.867 --> 15:13.037
Well, when we stopped for gas,
I looked through your contacts.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.830
Oh, and your daily smile reminder
went off.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.873
Oh, thanks.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.256
So...

15:25.966 --> 15:29.762
I was thinking about your relationship
with Rachel, and...

15:30.930 --> 15:33.307
I realize that you are also
driving your mirrors.

15:35.184 --> 15:39.021
You need to stop dwelling on the past
and start focusing on what's ahead.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.274
You want to be a good dad now.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.776
So do it.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.527
[sighs deeply]

15:48.030 --> 15:49.323
I don't know.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.992
I don't think she wants to see me.

15:53.118 --> 15:53.953
Look...

15:55.371 --> 15:58.958
I have some experience
with father-daughter baggage.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.462
And even when things were
at their absolute worst,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.589
I still just wanted a hug.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.883
To hear him say he loved me.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.887
I bet Rachel's no different.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.933
Okay, I'll do it.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.687
And, uh... thanks, Elena...

16:20.562 --> 16:22.690
because I never would have come here

Mami, I think my arroz con pollo
is almost ready.

17:02.896 --> 17:03.981
-Uh-huh.
-And I gotta admit

17:04.064 --> 17:05.899
I'm a little nervous
about having you taste it,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.318
which says something considering
I was, you know, in a war.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.319
[both laugh]

17:10.070 --> 17:12.197
Okay. Let's take a look.

-Uh-huh? No?

-Just kidding.

Oh, God!

17:24.334 --> 17:27.337
Like, I gotta tell you, it's really cool
that you taught me this recipe.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.006
-So thank you.
-Yeah.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.800
Bravissima, Lupita!

17:31.884 --> 17:35.262
With pollo that good,
no man will dare to leave you again.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.225
Excuse me. What did you just say?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.769
I said, "Bravissima!"

17:41.852 --> 17:43.771
It means "job well done" in Italian.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.651
Mami, did you want to teach me to cook
because you think it'll help me get a man?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.654
Because I got one, Mateo,
and he's great.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.864
Of course he is.

17:53.947 --> 17:56.116
You never had trouble
finding wonderful men.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.118
This is so you can keep them.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.704
Hey!

18:01.455 --> 18:03.749
I chose to leave Victor and Max.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.542
It wasn't because of my cooking.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.504
But I'm starting to think it might be
because of the annoying Cuban lady

18:08.587 --> 18:10.756
-who moved into my dining room.
-Oh.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.425
Now, you are getting mad for nothing.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.594
There are always things to work on.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.429
So I am helping you.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.765
That's why this was on the list.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.988
Fix me? What the hell does that mean?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.116
No, no, no, no, no.
It's just little tweaks.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.536
Como how you always wear
your pajamas going out of the house.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.788
I'm a nurse. They're scrubs!

18:44.289 --> 18:47.126
Lupita, you are a beautiful woman.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.045
Why not dress like a sexy nurse?

18:50.129 --> 18:54.174
Everyone on Grey's Monotony
looks amazing!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.802
What else do you think needs fixing?

18:56.885 --> 18:58.220
Nothing!

18:58.303 --> 19:00.973
Abuelita, the teeth-whitening trays
you ordered came.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.354
Listen, Mami, I have accomplished
a lot in my life.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.565
When will I ever be enough for you?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.656
It is not that you are not enough.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.619
It is that I have not finished my job
as a mother.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.746
What're you talking about? I'm 40.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.416
I have a good career.
I have two healthy kids.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.127
You are living in my house.
You're done.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.795
Done?

19:31.879 --> 19:35.048
You use a Trader Joe's bag as a purse!

19:35.674 --> 19:37.092
That was one time!

19:37.176 --> 19:42.556
Mira, when I woke up from that coma,
my first thought was... [gasps]

19:42.848 --> 19:45.559
..."I cannot believe
I almost left Lupita alone."

19:45.809 --> 19:48.729
So, no matter what I do,
I'm a failure if I'm not married?

19:48.812 --> 19:50.689
Gracias a Dios, you finally get it!

19:50.772 --> 19:51.982
Oh, my...

19:54.526 --> 19:55.527
Look...

19:56.653 --> 19:58.363
I know in your day...

19:59.323 --> 20:01.533
pleasing a man
was a woman's greatest achievement.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.035
You got that right.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.996
I had to be great in the kitchen,

20:06.079 --> 20:09.499
better on the dance floor,
and do my best work on my knees.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.709
Aye, Mami, gross!

20:12.169 --> 20:14.588
Que? I kept that floor very clean.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.842
I had to. Your father and I
made love on it all the time.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.265
You are lucky
that you met a guy like Papi.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.685
I haven't yet, but that's not my fault.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.189
But you are constantly telling me
that it is,

20:32.648 --> 20:35.359
and everything else
that you think is wrong with me.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.902
How do you think that makes me feel?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.490
You're always comparing me to you
because you think you're so perfect.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.077
But a perfect mom doesn't make
her kid feel like this.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.540
Bueno.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.684
Okay, Mom, I won't tell you
about my driving lesson

21:08.767 --> 21:10.143
because I know it stresses you out.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.020
So I'll just say that it went well,

21:12.104 --> 21:14.690

with his daughter.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.331
[sighs]

21:31.581 --> 21:32.416
What?

21:34.960 --> 21:38.255
I want you to know... that you are enough.

21:39.881 --> 21:43.385
Is this some passive-aggressive Mom way
of telling me not to gain weight?

21:43.468 --> 21:45.262
[laughing]
No!

21:45.345 --> 21:47.973
No. I just want you to know
that I'm not judging you,

21:48.265 --> 21:51.018
and I am in awe of who you've become.

21:52.477 --> 21:56.106
And if, for one second,
I ever made you feel like you weren't...

21:56.815 --> 22:00.485
a freaking perfect piece of work,
then I'm sorry.

22:02.946 --> 22:03.780
Okay.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.075
I don't know what happened
while I was gone,

22:07.159 --> 22:08.327
but I like you like this.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.042
Lupita.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.544
I have something for you.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.338
Better not be neck tightening cream.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.301
I just want to say...

22:25.552 --> 22:26.887
that I'm not sorry.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.640
Wow. Thanks.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.979
Mira, whatever comes out of my mouth

22:36.063 --> 22:40.025
comes out because I love you,
and I want you to be happy.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.488
I am not trying
to hurt your feelings, pero...

22:45.322 --> 22:48.241
if you want me
to accept you for being you,

22:49.117 --> 22:52.496
you have to accept me for being me.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.958
Lupita. To me...

22:57.626 --> 23:01.797
you are the most perfect person alive.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.217
There is no one even close to you.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.637
But... that goes without saying.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.139
[crying] No, Mami, it doesn't go
without saying.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.392
You have to say it.

23:15.685 --> 23:16.686
Okay.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.563
Okay.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.275
You...

23:23.360 --> 23:24.820
are enough.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.659
You are more than enough.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.124
-Okay.
-Okay?

23:37.416 --> 23:38.750
Ay, I said too much.

23:38.875 --> 23:39.835

23:40.669 --> 23:44.005
Anyways, here... the recipes.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.258
The Bible?

23:46.591 --> 23:48.885
I mean, I know your recipes
have been around a long time...

23:48.969 --> 23:51.263
Well, I keep them in the Bible

23:51.346 --> 23:55.892
because Mirtha cannot touch them
without burning her hands.

-It's amazing.
-Uh-huh.

Wait. These measurements don't make sense.

a man fall off a horse"?

24:15.036 --> 24:18.540
Oh, yes, it is written in code.
[laughs]

24:18.623 --> 24:20.625
The key will be delivered upon my death.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.838

24:25.589 --> 24:27.132
Oh.

I may outlive you.
