00:47.427 --> 00:50.624
What's gonna happen
with my family?

00:50.697 --> 00:55.066
My orders are to deliver you to the airfield.
I have no information beyond that.

00:55.135 --> 00:57.831
- Could you find out?
- (car horn)

00:59.873 --> 01:03.365
What's happening?
Why are we stopped?

01:06.813 --> 01:09.008
It's all right.
We're on our way.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.687
- They're here.
- I'm going.

01:21.762 --> 01:24.128
God, they're here!

01:24.197 --> 01:26.961
- (gunfire)
- Argh!

01:27.033 --> 01:31.197
Charlie Echo One. This is Foxtrot.
We're under attack!

01:36.777 --> 01:39.041
All right!

01:39.112 --> 01:41.444
Don't shoot!

01:41.515 --> 01:43.506
I'm coming out.

01:49.055 --> 01:51.683
Don't shoot.
Argh! Oh, God!

02:04.704 --> 02:06.069
Irina.

02:06.139 --> 02:08.437
You've compromised
our agenda, Jeffrey.

02:08.508 --> 02:10.703
No! I didn't do anything.

02:10.776 --> 02:13.007
This is all a mistake. OK!

02:13.880 --> 02:15.848
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:15.916 --> 02:19.352
Tell me exactly what you said
to my husband.

02:19.419 --> 02:22.911
- Did you tell him about the Horizon?
- No, of course not.

02:22.989 --> 02:26.117
No. You have to believe me.
I swear.

02:27.127 --> 02:29.322
I do believe you.

02:42.943 --> 02:45.969
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Agent Bristow.

02:46.046 --> 02:48.674
I know Langley's anxious
to debrief you.

02:51.251 --> 02:53.879
Is my baby OK?

02:53.954 --> 02:56.047
Yes.

02:57.157 --> 03:00.558
- You're sure?
- I can't imagine what you went through.

03:00.627 --> 03:06.293
Having said that, the surgery they
performed probably saved the pregnancy.

03:06.366 --> 03:10.564
You and your child
are in great health, Agent Bristow.

03:10.637 --> 03:13.231
Thank you.

03:13.306 --> 03:16.833
Call me Sydney. If you're gonna
deliver this baby in a few weeks,

03:16.910 --> 03:19.970
we might as well
get to know each other.

03:20.046 --> 03:22.037
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:22.115 --> 03:26.313
- They told me you were done.
- See you next week.

03:27.854 --> 03:30.687
- So you're OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.816
Hey, can I borrow your phone?
I want to...

03:32.893 --> 03:35.691
- The ClA released your father.
- They did?

03:35.762 --> 03:38.629
Davenport confessed.
Apparently he cut a deal.

03:38.698 --> 03:43.067
Your father wants to see us
before you contact APO.

03:43.136 --> 03:44.501
Where is he?

03:46.306 --> 03:48.740
Thanks.

03:48.808 --> 03:51.504
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

03:51.578 --> 03:53.842
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

03:57.217 --> 03:59.777
Rain check.
I'll find you when I'm done.

03:59.853 --> 04:02.651
(Devlin)...authority is not in question.
It's temporary.

04:02.722 --> 04:06.351
- Of course, I understand that.
- Davenport and I came up together.

04:06.426 --> 04:10.294
I'm godfather to his oldest son. How were
these people able to corrupt him?

04:10.363 --> 04:13.799
I have no idea. Agent Tom Grace,
this is Director Devlin.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.767
He will be auditing our investigation
on Prophet Five.

04:16.836 --> 04:19.668
- You'll assist him with whatever he needs.
- Of course.

04:19.738 --> 04:25.006
Thank you. I'd, for starters, like to see
all your sit reports and operation files.

04:25.078 --> 04:29.174
I can get the sit reps, but we're performing
diagnostic on the computer network.

04:29.249 --> 04:32.480
The files will take longer.
It's just routine.

04:32.552 --> 04:35.851
Who can provide me with admin privileges
to your access logs?

04:35.922 --> 04:39.187
That's Rachel Gibson.
She's over there.

04:39.759 --> 04:41.852
Thank you.

04:44.831 --> 04:46.628
What just happened?

04:46.700 --> 04:49.032
He wants to review
the computer transmissions

04:49.102 --> 04:53.505
to see if anyone provided Prophet Five
with Davenport's travel route.

04:53.573 --> 04:56.337
Right. He thinks the leak
came from this office

04:56.409 --> 04:59.640
and the phone logs
will reveal who it was?

04:59.713 --> 05:02.079
Apparently so.

05:30.377 --> 05:32.140
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

05:32.212 --> 05:34.942
OK, what's going on?
Why are we meeting out here?

05:35.015 --> 05:38.678
Davenport's been killed.
His transport was ambushed.

05:38.752 --> 05:41.550
That route was classified.
The only people who knew...

05:41.621 --> 05:45.853
Were ClA. You think Prophet Five
has another mole inside the agency?

05:45.925 --> 05:48.519
It would seem so, yes.
There's more.

05:48.595 --> 05:53.157
As a condition of my release, Devlin insists
we suspend our investigation of them

05:53.233 --> 05:55.428
until Langley
reviews our findings.

05:55.502 --> 05:57.436
- We can't do that.
- I agree.

05:57.504 --> 06:02.464
Which means as long as Devlin's in APO,
we have to stop documenting our work.

06:02.542 --> 06:06.808
Operations will be compartmentalized
to senior staff only.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.249
When I came to see you, you wanted to tell
me the reason Prophet Five abducted you.

06:11.317 --> 06:15.811
When I was on their ship, they performed
some kind of regression therapy.

06:15.889 --> 06:19.825
They wanted me to remember
a cipher - Leo 47 Norte.

06:19.893 --> 06:24.091
It was an entry on an Alliance organization
chart Vaughn showed me years ago.

06:24.164 --> 06:26.860
- Did you give them the intel?
- I changed the phrase.

06:26.933 --> 06:30.369
- That's good.
- 47 Norte...

06:32.272 --> 06:34.866
It's a territorial designation - France.

06:34.941 --> 06:37.535
"Leo" designates a specific mission.

06:37.610 --> 06:40.943
I'll review the archives.
Someone on that mission might be alive.

06:41.014 --> 06:45.417
I want you in Paris. If I'm successful,
you'll be in position to act quickly.

06:45.485 --> 06:51.446
Contact Renee Rienne. Ask her to provide
Dixon with the documentation he needs.

06:51.524 --> 06:54.687
Then I want you to pack a bag.
I'm moving you to a secure location.

06:54.761 --> 06:56.353
- No.
- It's just temporary.

06:56.429 --> 07:00.559
- Don't be silly. I wanna...
- Help. Yes, I know.

07:00.633 --> 07:04.296
For now, you need to go underground.
Prophet Five abducted you.

07:04.370 --> 07:06.531
We can't risk them doing it again.

07:15.014 --> 07:18.916
Don't blame your dad, Syd.
He's only trying to protect you.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.010
- Yeah.
- What?

07:21.921 --> 07:26.585
Do you remember what Dean said?
That Prophet Five had plans for me.

07:29.629 --> 07:33.121
They saved this baby for a reason.
Why?

07:33.900 --> 07:36.061
I don't know.

07:36.136 --> 07:38.730
Maybe that's why
Jack wants you in a safe house.

07:38.805 --> 07:42.434
- I can fend for myself.
- But you're not just fending for yourself.

07:42.509 --> 07:44.977
You're fending for two.

07:45.044 --> 07:47.205
And let's be honest, Syd.

07:47.947 --> 07:50.780
Right now, you waddle.

07:50.850 --> 07:53.182
- I don't waddle.
- Oh, yes, you do.

07:53.253 --> 07:58.213
I'll admit I may be a little less graceful,
but I don't waddle.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.384
You're right.

08:01.795 --> 08:05.162
Actually, it's more of a teeter.

08:21.514 --> 08:23.914
Hello, Sydney.

08:25.885 --> 08:28.080
Mom.

09:01.654 --> 09:04.782
You look beautiful.

09:08.661 --> 09:11.186
I'm here now.

09:11.264 --> 09:14.131
Everything is gonna be fine.

09:21.074 --> 09:23.304
Mom...

09:23.376 --> 09:25.367
I am so glad you're here.

09:25.445 --> 09:30.405
Believe me, there's no one else
I want to go through this with, but...

09:31.985 --> 09:34.010
- It isn't safe.
- Sydney.

09:35.588 --> 09:37.988
Mom, we're involved
in an investigation.

09:38.057 --> 09:40.423
The ClA is everywhere.
If they find out...

09:40.493 --> 09:42.552
I know about Prophet Five.

09:43.863 --> 09:46.661
I know they abducted you.

09:47.934 --> 09:50.926
That's the reason I've come.

09:52.939 --> 09:54.930
They've been rumored
for over 30 years.

09:55.008 --> 09:59.672
An organization so secret,
most of us thought they were a myth.

09:59.746 --> 10:04.740
Then six months ago, a contact of mine
told me they'd become active again.

10:04.817 --> 10:08.446
That, after all this time,
they finally found someone

10:08.521 --> 10:12.150
who they believe could lead them
to what they've been looking for.

10:12.225 --> 10:18.391
The reason they came together,
to pursue something they call the Horizon.

10:23.369 --> 10:26.896
- You've never heard of it?
- No.

10:26.973 --> 10:29.999
Prophet Five believes you have.

10:30.076 --> 10:32.874
They believe
you know where it is.

10:38.351 --> 10:40.410
What are you thinking?

10:40.486 --> 10:42.716
When Prophet Five abducted me,

10:43.222 --> 10:48.023
they tried to get me to reveal information
about an old Alliance mission.

10:48.094 --> 10:50.187
What was the mission?

10:50.263 --> 10:53.664
I don't know the details,
just the code name.

10:54.534 --> 10:57.002
But Dad is looking into it.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.994
You told your father?

11:00.606 --> 11:02.597
That's good.

11:03.509 --> 11:05.773
How's Jack?

11:05.845 --> 11:08.177
He's good.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.810
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

11:13.886 --> 11:16.116
I know.

11:20.059 --> 11:22.960
(whispers) I'm so sorry.

11:28.368 --> 11:31.303
It was an Alliance mission,
designation Leo 47 Norte.

11:31.371 --> 11:35.273
47 Norte. Got it. All Alliance files
are backed up on Langley's archives.

11:35.341 --> 11:39.437
Can you do it without being traced
back to this office?

11:39.512 --> 11:42.777
So Devlin can't find out about it?

11:44.250 --> 11:47.947
Sure. I can use a proxy
to spoof the origin.

11:49.355 --> 11:54.383
I love secret conspiracies.
You know, as long as I'm a co-conspirator.

11:57.563 --> 12:03.798
OK, here it is. Operation originating back
in 1 999, coordinated by a Jean Bertrand.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.395
Let me see if I can find him.

12:07.340 --> 12:11.902
In high school, we took apart a professor's
car and reassembled it in his classroom.

12:11.978 --> 12:15.812
My friends did. I'd have helped, but they
didn't trust me - said I had loose lips,

12:15.882 --> 12:18.373
- which you know is ridiculous.
- Hey, Marshall.

12:18.451 --> 12:21.909
- Nothing. We're not doing anything.
- (phone rings)

12:21.988 --> 12:25.014
- Yes.
- Let me know when the diagnostic is done.

12:25.091 --> 12:27.787
You got it.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.455
- Good to see you, Tom.
- That is unexpected.

12:32.432 --> 12:34.900
- I'll be there shortly.
- Was that Syd?

12:35.735 --> 12:39.466
Your voice modulates a little when
you're talking to Syd. Everything OK?

12:39.539 --> 12:41.700
What do you have on Bertrand?

12:41.774 --> 12:43.139
Right.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.700
Secret.

12:47.547 --> 12:50.072
Latest intel places Bertrand in Paris.

12:50.149 --> 12:53.312
OK, forward the intel to Dixon.
He's joining up with Renee.

12:53.386 --> 12:56.446
Use Tech three.
I don't want it going through APO servers.

12:56.522 --> 12:58.422
Got it.

13:00.226 --> 13:02.592
Is she still here?

13:16.109 --> 13:18.270
Jack.

13:19.312 --> 13:22.145
You look... well.

13:24.016 --> 13:26.610
I got your messages.
I wanted to reply.

13:26.686 --> 13:29.553
But I sensed it might be a ClA trap.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.458
Look at us,
about to become grandparents.

13:35.528 --> 13:38.691
I'm doing my best to ignore that.

13:38.764 --> 13:41.255
Did Sydney tell you?

13:42.568 --> 13:44.900
I fear for her safety.

13:44.971 --> 13:46.563
Yes, she did.

13:46.639 --> 13:49.472
(Sydney) Did Dixon find out anything?

13:50.309 --> 13:53.039
Not yet,
but he's with a source now.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.599
(speaks French)

14:16.836 --> 14:18.463
(Dixon)

15:23.769 --> 15:25.066
(tires squeal)

15:25.638 --> 15:27.697
(sobs)

15:27.773 --> 15:30.469
Thanks.
No, I'll take it from here.

15:31.277 --> 15:34.041
Dixon.
He couldn't confirm what the Horizon is.

15:34.113 --> 15:37.776
But we know it's in a safe deposit box
in Vancouver at Queens Bank.

15:37.850 --> 15:42.810
We need to act fast. Prophet Five will have
figured out I gave the wrong information.

15:42.888 --> 15:44.753
Yeah, that's a safe assumption.

15:44.824 --> 15:48.191
We can't use APO.
Devlin's men are everywhere.

15:48.261 --> 15:50.786
If you're being watched,
I can go.

15:50.863 --> 15:53.593
I have contacts in Vancouver.

15:56.702 --> 15:59.671
We'll go together.
Retrieve the Horizon ourselves.

15:59.739 --> 16:01.730
Can you make
the travel arrangements?

16:01.807 --> 16:03.866
Make 'em for three.
I'm going too.

16:03.943 --> 16:06.434
I know you're worried about my safety.

16:06.512 --> 16:09.538
It's a three-hour flight. A bank.
We'll be in and out.

16:09.615 --> 16:10.946
- Sydney...
- Listen.

16:11.017 --> 16:13.577
The Horizon is why
Prophet Five killed Vaughn.

16:13.653 --> 16:15.951
It's why they kidnapped me.

16:16.022 --> 16:21.460
If we can get it before they do,
we can finish this thing. For good.

16:23.296 --> 16:25.457
Make the arrangements.

16:35.241 --> 16:37.801
Peyton. We just got a message
from lrina Derevko.

16:37.877 --> 16:42.246
The Horizon is in Vancouver.
She's on her way to retrieve it.

16:42.315 --> 16:44.681
Assemble a team.
We're going too.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.208
- Do you question Derevko's loyalty?
- No, I don't.

16:48.287 --> 16:50.778
But I'm not willing
to take the chance I'm wrong.

16:50.856 --> 16:53.017
Not when we're this close.

17:08.540 --> 17:13.273
Mr. and Mrs. Visconti.
My apologies, but the bank is closing.

17:13.346 --> 17:17.077
Perhaps we can find another time
to endow your grandchild's trust fund?

17:17.148 --> 17:19.982
- My daughter's never late.
- It's that clown she married!

17:20.051 --> 17:22.577
Of course, darling,
it's never our angel's fault.

17:22.655 --> 17:26.250
Papa, Mama. Sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry.

17:30.963 --> 17:33.955
- Where's Roberto?
- He's not coming.

17:34.033 --> 17:36.934
He says he doesn't
want your money, Papa.

17:37.002 --> 17:39.095
It is his job to provide for our baby.

17:39.171 --> 17:42.663
How does he expect to provide
for my grandchild? He's a clown!

17:42.742 --> 17:44.232
- He is an artist.
- Brigitte.

17:44.310 --> 17:48.508
We agreed that the trust fund would be
a safety net, in case things don't work out.

17:48.581 --> 17:51.072
- But they will. We love each other.
- Of course.

17:51.150 --> 17:55.644
The two of you will be as happy
as your father and I have been.

17:55.721 --> 17:58.519
Let us do this for you.
Let us help.

18:00.826 --> 18:03.021
OK. For the baby.

18:03.863 --> 18:08.562
Signor, we would be grateful
if you could assist us with the deposit now.

18:08.634 --> 18:11.364
I'm sorry,
but it's too late.

18:13.072 --> 18:15.734
Here is a cashier's check.

18:15.808 --> 18:18.402
Drawn on the trust account.

18:18.477 --> 18:21.173
That is a very generous amount.

18:21.247 --> 18:24.045
He said no, my darling.
Bank Lissand is open till six.

18:24.116 --> 18:28.849
- Maybe if we hurry, we can...
- That won't be necessary.

18:28.921 --> 18:34.518
It would be a privilege to help you plan for
your family's future. I have a daughter too.

18:34.593 --> 18:38.757
Then you'll know that it's a parent's job
to take care of their children.

18:38.831 --> 18:40.822
Mama.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.132
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:49.208 --> 18:53.542
- Is now a good time for that rain check?
- Yeah, sure. What's up?

18:53.612 --> 18:56.137
I know about Allen Korman.

18:57.249 --> 19:00.878
I know that you broke into WlTSEC
to find him.

19:00.953 --> 19:03.251
That he killed your wife.

19:04.390 --> 19:08.190
Please promise me
that you're not going to do anything stupid.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.956
That you're not going after him.

19:12.498 --> 19:14.830
I already did.

19:14.900 --> 19:17.164
I saw him last night.

19:18.838 --> 19:21.807
I followed him
to a parking garage.

19:22.641 --> 19:25.405
I watched him
get out of his car.

19:27.046 --> 19:29.879
Andthenthere hewas.

19:29.949 --> 19:33.510
I was ten feet away
from the man that killed my wife.

19:38.424 --> 19:41.222
Then I watched his wife
get out of the car...

19:42.194 --> 19:44.355
and their little son...

19:45.965 --> 19:48.126
and I watched his life...

19:50.202 --> 19:52.636
and I just walked away.

19:53.873 --> 19:59.368
I mean, killing him
is not gonna bring back my wife.

20:01.247 --> 20:03.977
No. It won't.

20:06.051 --> 20:08.645
I should've told you about her.

20:09.622 --> 20:14.821
I guess we just get so comfortable
keeping secrets around here.

20:17.329 --> 20:18.956
Yeah.

20:23.636 --> 20:27.231
- And congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:28.207 --> 20:32.803
- If Roberto finds out, he'll be very angry.
- Then it'll be our family secret.

20:32.878 --> 20:35.472
We'll find a place
to keep the trust documents safe.

20:35.548 --> 20:40.212
Perhaps Signor Moreau can help us. Do
you have a safety deposit we can use?

20:40.286 --> 20:42.345
- Of course!
- (yelps)

20:43.188 --> 20:46.316
- Everything all right, my dear?
- Yes.

20:46.392 --> 20:48.553
Your grandchild keeps kicking me.

20:48.627 --> 20:53.587
You've had a very busy day. Would you
mind if our daughter waited here?

20:53.666 --> 20:56.499
Not at all.
If you'll follow me.

21:00.873 --> 21:03.137
It's sweet your daughter
wants to please you.

21:03.208 --> 21:07.440
- She's our pride and joy.
- I'm sure she'll be a wonderful parent.

21:07.513 --> 21:11.643
- Thank you.
- She has two such lovely role models.

21:16.555 --> 21:17.385
(phone rings)

21:17.456 --> 21:19.720
Excuse me. Hello.

21:19.792 --> 21:23.888
- (Sydney) Hey. Tom. I need your help.
- Hey, Dad. What's going on?

21:23.963 --> 21:27.922
- Back door into a secure database.
- These are the files right here.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.094
Yeah, I know.
Computers are tricky, you're right.

21:31.170 --> 21:34.230
I'm gonna put you on with our tech support.
Her name's Rachel.

21:34.306 --> 21:37.639
She'll be able to help you out.
Hold on.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.702
Hey, my dad's on the phone.
He kind of needs your help?

21:40.779 --> 21:45.443
We've taken great pains
to ensure the security of this facility.

21:45.517 --> 21:51.683
In fact, we pride ourselves on
being too careful with our clients' assets.

21:51.757 --> 21:54.351
That's good to hear.

21:54.426 --> 21:58.453
It looks like 51 2-bit encryption. I can open
a port if you need to run a program.

21:58.530 --> 22:01.328
Uh, no, that's OK.
I think I got it.

22:03.369 --> 22:06.827
What about emergency response
if an alarm is tripped?

22:06.905 --> 22:12.275
- How long before the authorities respond?
- We have round-the-clock security.

22:12.344 --> 22:18.647
Our drills place it at four minutes,
but to be honest, it's never been activated.

22:18.717 --> 22:21.083
Then let's keep it that way.

22:22.388 --> 22:24.754
Syd, we've got it.
What's the box number?

22:24.823 --> 22:30.853
- Hang on, Dad. Rachel?
- OK, try this. 8438220.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.234
You have to show me how you do that.

22:37.302 --> 22:39.964
A magician never reveals her secrets.
Be safe.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.030
Thanks.

22:45.577 --> 22:47.875
OK, Dad. Box 1 35.

23:30.823 --> 23:33.223
- I can't open it.
- Why?

23:33.292 --> 23:36.523
Countermeasure.
Looks like it's acid-based.

23:36.595 --> 23:38.995
- Disable it.
- Not without the combination.

23:39.064 --> 23:43.694
It'll destroy the contents. We'll have
to take it back to Marshall. He'll be able...

23:45.270 --> 23:47.329
Peyton's here.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.910
Talk. Fast.

23:53.979 --> 23:57.710
They're here as backup.
You're working with them, aren't you?

23:57.783 --> 23:59.512
Answerme!

24:01.353 --> 24:03.947
That was you. On the ship.

24:05.224 --> 24:08.853
Wasn't it?
Behind the glass.

24:09.962 --> 24:15.423
You orchestrated the whole thing
because you wanted this.

24:15.501 --> 24:21.098
And when... when you couldn't torture it
out of me, you came to me as my mother.

24:22.174 --> 24:24.574
I am your mother.

24:26.178 --> 24:29.045
- Call off your team right now.
- They're not my team.

24:29.114 --> 24:30.979
- I don't believe you.
- Dad?

24:31.049 --> 24:35.679
You need to believe me. 'Cause if Peyton's
here, she's here to kill me too.

24:35.754 --> 24:38.723
She'll be disappointed,
because I'll beat her to it.

24:38.791 --> 24:41.157
- Hey, Dad?
- I thought I killed you once.

24:41.226 --> 24:44.718
- This time I'll be more thorough.
- Dad!

24:44.797 --> 24:47.766
Baby's coming.

25:00.679 --> 25:03.546
We have a problem.

25:03.615 --> 25:06.175
Devlin's men
are accessing our server logs.

25:06.251 --> 25:10.847
They believe there's a mole within APO
leaking information to Prophet Five.

25:10.923 --> 25:15.326
- You think they're right?
- No. No, I don't.

25:16.261 --> 25:19.287
However, Sydney and Jack
are in the field without clearance.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.764
- I've been assisting them.
- So have l.

25:21.834 --> 25:24.098
Yes. I know.

25:24.169 --> 25:30.039
I've already tried purging the logs myself,
but the files are read-only.

25:30.108 --> 25:34.875
I can do it. I can crack the logs
and delete the entries. Make it untraceable.

25:34.947 --> 25:39.281
- But it will take a little time.
- Well, then, get to it right now.

25:39.351 --> 25:41.182
You should sit.

25:42.921 --> 25:45.116
Look, we need to get out of here.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.454
- What's their approach?
- What?

25:47.526 --> 25:50.017
Their plan.
How are they going to attack us?

25:50.095 --> 25:54.657
I don't know. I already told you,
this wasn't part of my operation.

25:55.567 --> 25:58.764
You want to escape?
Give me the Horizon.

25:58.837 --> 26:02.136
- I'll tell them you left the building.
- That isn't going to happen.

26:02.207 --> 26:04.732
Jack, don't be stubborn.
The baby is coming.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.971
I'm trying to help.

26:08.814 --> 26:11.282
Giving you a way out.

26:21.793 --> 26:25.229
OK, I'm in.
We've got control of their system.

26:25.297 --> 26:28.960
- Can you see them?
- The bank has its own security feed.

26:29.034 --> 26:31.332
If they enter the stairwells,
I'll see them.

26:31.403 --> 26:34.770
Lock down the building.
We're going up.

26:35.474 --> 26:39.934
How were you gonna do it? Once you took
the Horizon, what was your extraction?

26:44.583 --> 26:48.178
Look, they're coming.
How were you going to get away from us?

26:49.121 --> 26:53.421
- There's a helicopter waiting for my signal.
- Does Prophet Five know about it?

26:53.492 --> 26:54.720
No.

26:54.793 --> 26:57.762
Elevators are grounded.
It's four flights to the roof.

26:57.829 --> 27:00.263
- I can make it.
- Move!

27:02.034 --> 27:04.832
- Peyton, I've got a visual.
- Go ahead.

27:04.903 --> 27:07.531
They've entered the main stairwell,
1 5th floor.

27:07.606 --> 27:11.804
But they're not coming down.
They're heading up.

27:12.611 --> 27:16.547
The helipad. Redirect those cameras
to exterior surveillance.

27:16.615 --> 27:18.742
I'll keep going.
I'm six floors behind.

27:20.185 --> 27:22.585
What's the signal for the helicopter?

27:22.654 --> 27:25.020
A beacon.

27:25.090 --> 27:27.524
- It's in my bra.
- (labored breathing)

27:31.763 --> 27:33.924
Keep moving.

27:36.234 --> 27:38.566
We're almost there.

27:52.184 --> 27:54.744
Chopper.
Approaching from the northwest.

27:54.820 --> 27:57.414
Damn.

27:57.489 --> 27:59.582
Out here.

28:03.261 --> 28:05.821
(helicopter)

28:22.114 --> 28:24.639
Quickly.

28:55.180 --> 28:57.546
- There has to be a freight elevator.
- Sydney.

28:57.616 --> 29:01.814
If we hotwire a junction box, we might
be able to restore power to one of the cars.

29:01.887 --> 29:05.050
They'll still be waiting
as soon as we override the elevator.

29:05.123 --> 29:09.059
- We have to try.
- We need to set up a defensive position.

29:09.127 --> 29:11.994
I'm not interested in your opinion.

29:12.064 --> 29:16.228
She's right. Even if we outflanked them
down the stairwell, you wouldn't make it.

29:16.301 --> 29:18.098
Here.

29:18.170 --> 29:22.231
Cover your mother. I'll go down
and take care of Peyton and her men.

29:22.307 --> 29:24.036
I'll be right back.

29:24.109 --> 29:28.546
Whatever happens, keep that pointed
at your mother. If she even blinks...

29:28.613 --> 29:31.548
I'll shoot her.

29:32.517 --> 29:35.509
OK, I'm in.
Logs are online.

29:35.587 --> 29:38.613
- Have they found anything?
- They're working on the logs.

29:38.690 --> 29:41.090
I'm gonna start with the comm entries.

29:41.159 --> 29:44.856
Here we go. This is Sydney's
communication from Vancouver.

29:44.930 --> 29:48.195
And Paris.
This is Dixon's PBX communication.

29:48.266 --> 29:51.292
- I think that's it. Nothing else...
- No, there's one more.

29:51.369 --> 29:55.271
I had to post satellite imagery
for the building in Vancouver. Delete that.

29:55.340 --> 29:59.140
Time stamp should be
somewhere between midnight and 2am.

30:01.246 --> 30:02.975
There.

30:03.048 --> 30:06.779
- Tindle isn't your login name.
- No. My network account timed out.

30:06.852 --> 30:09.650
I had to create a temporary one.

30:11.857 --> 30:13.381
- I can't do it.
- What?

30:13.458 --> 30:18.953
They're on the same page of entries. That's
them now. If we delete this, they'll see it.

30:22.501 --> 30:24.492
(phone rings)

30:25.437 --> 30:27.098
- Devlin.
- It's me.

30:27.172 --> 30:31.438
It seems you don't have the latest logs.
What's the time stamp on your last entry?

30:31.510 --> 30:34.240
Scroll to the end of the list.

30:38.316 --> 30:40.147
1 0:37 this morning.

30:42.487 --> 30:46.082
OK. It matches up.
Sorry about the interruption.

30:49.227 --> 30:51.024
Good work.

30:57.536 --> 30:59.902
"The truth takes time."

30:59.971 --> 31:01.996
That's what you said.

31:02.073 --> 31:04.234
Years ago.

31:05.177 --> 31:07.645
Is this what you meant?

31:09.114 --> 31:11.605
You like it to be simple.

31:13.351 --> 31:15.683
It's never simple.

31:19.658 --> 31:22.786
Did you put out the order
to kill Vaughn?

31:33.838 --> 31:37.604
I'd known about his investigation
for a long time.

31:37.676 --> 31:40.440
In Sovogda I tried to warn him.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.210
He didn't take my advice.

31:44.282 --> 31:47.012
I fell for you.

31:47.085 --> 31:49.417
Even Dad fell for you.

31:51.389 --> 31:54.483
But Vaughn never trusted you.

31:57.896 --> 31:59.693
(small cry)

32:09.007 --> 32:11.168
(footsteps)

32:15.580 --> 32:17.775
(slams)

32:18.817 --> 32:20.944
This is Alpha team.
We're on 1 6.

32:21.019 --> 32:24.511
- We have a possible target.
- Copy that.

32:51.783 --> 32:53.944
Alpha team, report.

32:54.019 --> 32:56.180
Alpha team, do you copy?

32:58.156 --> 33:02.786
- Barker, where are you?
- Just swept 17. moving on to 18.

33:02.861 --> 33:06.661
Roger.
Finish up there and report in.

33:08.933 --> 33:10.457
(pained breathing)

33:10.535 --> 33:12.901
- Exhale through your mouth.
- No!

33:12.971 --> 33:15.166
- I'm only offering advice.
- Don't!

33:17.909 --> 33:21.401
I know why you saved my pregnancy.

33:21.479 --> 33:24.971
You want my baby,
and I don't know why.

33:25.817 --> 33:30.083
Frankly, I don't care.
I just want you to leave us alone.

33:32.424 --> 33:35.416
You should know something, Sydney.

33:36.428 --> 33:39.397
I never wanted to have a child.

33:40.865 --> 33:42.992
The KGB demanded it.

33:43.968 --> 33:48.029
They knew it would ensure
your father's allegiance to me.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.032
You were simply a means to an end.

33:54.813 --> 33:59.546
And then when the doctor
put you in my arms and I looked at you...

34:00.552 --> 34:02.713
So fragile.

34:04.489 --> 34:09.688
All I could think was, "How could l
have made such a terrible mistake?"

34:10.895 --> 34:14.524
And at that moment
I was sure of one thing.

34:14.599 --> 34:17.659
I couldn't be an agent
and a mother.

34:17.735 --> 34:20.000
I'd either fail at one or both.

34:24.275 --> 34:27.266
And! chosetofail atbeing a mother.

34:31.850 --> 34:34.819
Give me the gun.
Syd, they're coming.

34:55.540 --> 34:58.873
In time, you'll learn.
You can't do both.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.805
Watch me.

35:03.081 --> 35:05.606
(pained cries)

35:17.962 --> 35:23.298
The only reason I saved the baby
is because you're my daughter.

35:23.368 --> 35:27.168
Now do exactly as I tell you.
Get in that chair.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.077
(door opens)

35:50.829 --> 35:53.696
This really is no place for you, Grandpa.

35:53.765 --> 35:59.567
By the way, where's Sydney registered?
I'd love to get her a gift for the baby.

36:40.545 --> 36:44.538
- Sydney, don't push.
- God, Mom, I have to.

36:44.616 --> 36:47.176
No, no, no. No!
Listen to me.

36:47.252 --> 36:51.188
Don't push.
I know you want to, but you can't.

36:51.990 --> 36:54.015
Sydney, listen to me.

36:54.092 --> 36:56.788
The baby is coming out backwards.

36:57.962 --> 37:00.089
- W-what does that mean?
- What is it?

37:00.164 --> 37:04.032
Her muscles are locked. She needs
to relax. The baby needs oxygen.

37:04.102 --> 37:08.198
- If it doesn't come out right now...
- Sydney, squeeze my hand.

37:08.273 --> 37:12.039
This is important.
As hard as you can.

37:12.477 --> 37:14.502
- Dad.
- (Irina) Just keep breathing.

37:14.579 --> 37:17.139
- Dad.
- OK, good.

37:17.215 --> 37:19.410
(Irina) In and out.

37:20.251 --> 37:22.583
OK, now, again.
Look at me.

37:25.323 --> 37:29.350
- You can do this.
- I can't, Dad. I can't.

37:29.427 --> 37:31.657
Sydney. Yes, you can.

37:31.729 --> 37:33.720
I don't want to do this here.

37:33.798 --> 37:37.666
- That's OK. Tell me where you want to be.
- I'm scared.

37:37.735 --> 37:42.604
I know. That's why we're here. We'll take
care of you. Tell me where you want to be.

37:42.674 --> 37:46.940
- I want to be on a beach.
- That's good. OK. Just go there.

37:47.011 --> 37:49.241
Now tell me about it.

37:50.281 --> 37:55.048
- Vaughn is with me.
- Vaughn is there with you on the beach.

37:55.119 --> 37:57.451
Good. Vaughn is with you.

37:57.522 --> 38:00.082
- I miss him.
- I know.

38:01.259 --> 38:03.557
I know you do, sweetheart.

38:03.628 --> 38:06.096
It's OK. You're gonna be OK.

38:06.164 --> 38:08.394
OK, now, Sydney. Push.

38:08.466 --> 38:11.230
(Jack) Sydney, you can do this.

38:11.803 --> 38:14.533
OK. Now, again.

38:14.606 --> 38:16.267
Push.

38:16.341 --> 38:19.777
Sydney, as hard as you can!

38:21.012 --> 38:22.946
(Irina) Good!

38:27.752 --> 38:30.812
- (baby cries)
- Sydney.

38:33.124 --> 38:35.285
You have a baby girl.

38:55.813 --> 38:59.112
- She took the satchel.
- I know.

38:59.183 --> 39:01.276
We'll find her.

39:03.287 --> 39:06.256
Sweetheart.

39:08.660 --> 39:11.151
She's so beautiful.

39:15.233 --> 39:17.224
(phone rings)

39:18.269 --> 39:21.204
- Flinkman.
- (Irina) Listen to me very carefully.

39:21.272 --> 39:25.971
Jack and Sydney are in Vancouver.
Queens Bank. They need extraction.

39:26.044 --> 39:29.480
OK... uh...
Is this who I think it is?

39:29.981 --> 39:33.280
Tell the team they'll need diapers.

39:34.686 --> 39:36.654
OK.

39:46.931 --> 39:51.300
I just spoke to Dixon.
He's in contact with Europol and the SVR.

39:51.369 --> 39:54.770
So far, nothing.
We'll find her, Sydney.

40:01.713 --> 40:05.308
Would you like to hold
your granddaughter?

40:05.383 --> 40:07.442
Yes, I would.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.030
She has Vaughn's eyes.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.663
Yes, she does.

40:33.811 --> 40:35.870
Dad.

40:41.819 --> 40:44.151
I'll take care of it.

41:33.471 --> 41:35.462
(whisper)

42:28.659 --> 42:30.388
(children) Bad robot!
