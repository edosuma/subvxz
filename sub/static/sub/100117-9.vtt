Cass:
God is back.

Dean:
Jack's gone.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.443
Chuck:
Welcome to the End.

00:12.534 --> 00:13.926
Hello.

00:13.970 --> 00:15.885

It w-- it was
a piece of me.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.342

Dean: Eileen hit a snag
with a case.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.531
Hi, Sam.I will help you.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.533
What was done in the darkness
can be done to God.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.622
That's the spell.
To bind the spell together,

00:57.666 --> 00:59.450
the nectar from
a Leviathan blossom.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.104
What is that,
like a flower?

01:01.148 --> 01:02.627
A flower that only
grows in one place.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.238
Purgatory.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.718
That's the door.
It'll remain open for 12 hours.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.829
Chuck: Hi, Sam.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.748
I'm sorry.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.144
It's not your fault,
Eileen.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.363
Is it?

01:42.406 --> 01:45.540
What are you doing
to me?

01:45.583 --> 01:48.673
Same thing I've been doing
for weeks --

01:48.717 --> 01:51.763
helping,
helping you to the bunker,

01:51.807 --> 01:53.852
to Sam...

01:53.896 --> 01:56.159
to romance.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.466
It was easy, really,
just a nudge here,

01:58.509 --> 02:01.947
a conveniently placed
spell there.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.304
Wait.
That was you?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.175
Uh, it wasn't all me,
Sam.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.785
I just gave you
half the spell.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.266
You did the rest
all on your own...

02:16.310 --> 02:18.181
which I knew
you would...

02:19.400 --> 02:21.358
...because you're such
a good guy.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.446
Why?

02:22.490 --> 02:23.752
I couldn't see you.

02:23.795 --> 02:26.363
I needed eyes and ears
on the inside.

02:26.407 --> 02:30.802
Well, eyes, anyway.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.152
Screw you.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.762
Yeah.

02:33.805 --> 02:38.462
You know, I hate missing
my favorite show.

02:38.506 --> 02:41.552
So I was right.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.206
You're weak.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.295
Well, I wouldn't say "weak,"
exactly.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
I mean,
I piñata'd Hell.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.082
But, yeah,
you figured it out --

02:50.126 --> 02:52.824
we're connected
by these wounds.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.958
Which --
annoying, right?

02:56.001 --> 03:00.223
And as long as we are,
I'm stuck in this world.

03:01.703 --> 03:04.706
But you know
what they say...

03:08.405 --> 03:11.539
...all good things
must come to an end.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.247
Come on, Sam!

03:24.291 --> 03:25.901
This is Sam.
Leave me a message.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.643
Have you tried Eileen?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.601
Yeah.
Same thing -- no answer.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.387
Well, maybe they just have
their hands full with her case.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.477
Yeah.
Or they're in trouble.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.654
What are you doing?

03:39.697 --> 03:41.873
Our wounds
aren't healing properly.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.353
Because of you.

03:43.397 --> 03:46.704
It's as if there's something
festering inside of you,

03:46.748 --> 03:49.141
something that won't
let go.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.145
Now,
I can't see it.

03:53.189 --> 03:56.366
I can't snap it away.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.541
But I know it's there.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.195
So, what, are you gonna just
cut it out?

04:00.414 --> 04:02.590
Hey, good idea.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.200
Eileen,
where the hell are you?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.941
You're so helpful, Sam.
Now sit still.Eileen?

04:05.984 --> 04:08.073
I don't really know
what I'm looking for here,

04:08.117 --> 04:10.162
so this might
get messy.

04:19.171 --> 04:22.218
I think
we have an audience.

04:24.873 --> 04:27.005
Come on, Eileen.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.102
Eileen?

04:37.146 --> 04:39.191
Eileen?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.498
Hi, Dean.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.674
Chuck, you dick.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.937
Bye, Dean.

04:52.988 --> 04:56.687
Now,
where were we?

04:56.731 --> 04:59.777
Right.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.570
Dean: How the hell
did this happen?

05:09.613 --> 05:12.224
What are you doing?Tracking Sam's phone.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.661
Okay,
here we go.

05:13.704 --> 05:14.662
Uh...

05:14.705 --> 05:17.491
Milford, Nebraska,
at a casino.

05:17.534 --> 05:20.320
What the hell is Chuck doing
at a casino?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.191
Whatever.
We need to go.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.627
To Purgatory.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.281
Chuck has Sam.
I'm not leaving him.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.805
Chuck's not gonna kill him.
That's not the ending.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.590
Wh--
Then he'll torture him.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.200
Dean,
will you stop?

05:31.243 --> 05:33.681
Just stop
being so stupid.

05:33.724 --> 05:34.638
What?

05:34.682 --> 05:35.987
If we attack Chuck now,

05:36.031 --> 05:38.338
we don't have anything
that can hurt him.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.950
We get
that Leviathan blossom,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.039
complete Michael's spell,
build the Cage.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.345
That's our chance.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.477
That's the way
we'll save Sam,

05:47.521 --> 05:50.350
and that's the way
we'll save the world.

06:02.492 --> 06:03.841
What's the matter,
Chuck?

06:03.885 --> 06:07.671
Nothing.
I'm just -- I'm thinking.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.065
No.
You're stalling.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.936
What? Am not.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.460
You are.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.113
Mnh-mnh. No.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.463
Yeah.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.943
You blink people
out of existence.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.511
But when it's time
to get your hands dirty,

06:21.555 --> 06:22.730
you can't do it.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.166
You just
like to watch.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.690
Wow, Chuck.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.562
That -- That's a...

06:28.605 --> 06:31.260
I don't even know
what to call that.

06:31.303 --> 06:34.568
Eileen: I do.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.832
I'd call it pathetic.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.882
You know what?

06:44.926 --> 06:46.449
You're right.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.799
I do like to watch.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.148
Eileen.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.467
Sam...

07:04.511 --> 07:06.338
No.
What are you doing
to her?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.992
Stop, please.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.995
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.476
Ah, why didn't I think
of this first?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.565
It's so much
more poetic.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.916
Eileen?She's still in there,
Sam.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.181
This is gonna hurt her
as much as it hurts you.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.011
Ahh!

07:27.055 --> 07:28.317
Ohh.
Mnh!

07:28.360 --> 07:30.319
Maybe not
quite as much.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.325
I mean, how the hell
are we supposed to even know

07:36.368 --> 07:37.979
what we're
looking for here?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.502
You know,
Michael coulda done us a solid

07:39.546 --> 07:41.025
and drawn us
a picture.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.637
You know, of all the time
I've been in Purgatory,

07:43.680 --> 07:46.030
I've never seen a bloom
of any kind.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.336
Yeah. Exactly.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.120
Well,
if we see it, we'll know.

07:49.164 --> 07:52.820
It's likely to be
the only flower here.

07:52.863 --> 07:53.821
Alright.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.953
Well,
maybe we'll run into Benny.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.782
He's probably
king of this place by now.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.133
Okay.
Let's split up.
What?

08:02.177 --> 08:03.744
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.267
We'll meet
back at the Rift, alright?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.443
We'll cover more ground.
We'll better our odds.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.836
Yeah. We'll also
improve our odds

08:08.879 --> 08:11.273
of getting lost
or killed.

08:13.188 --> 08:16.931
Come on.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.851
Sam: Ahh!

08:25.417 --> 08:27.550
Ahh!

08:30.988 --> 08:33.295
It's okay.
It's okay.

08:34.818 --> 08:38.343
I know --
I know it's not you.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.087
It's not working.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.098
I'm gonna die
in this chair, Chuck.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.578
Ahh!

08:58.059 --> 09:01.279
Aah!

09:01.323 --> 09:02.803
Mnh.

09:02.846 --> 09:06.720
'Cause you'll keep cutting
until I bleed out, and...

09:06.763 --> 09:10.114
that's 'cause
you don't know what else to do.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.507
What then, Chuck?

09:11.551 --> 09:15.163
You -- You -- You just
bring me back and try again?

09:17.818 --> 09:19.341
Son of a bitch!

09:25.521 --> 09:26.653
Go. Go.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.177
Clean yourself up.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.573
How are you still
like this?

09:33.616 --> 09:36.750
Like what?

09:36.793 --> 09:40.580
This...defiant.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.277
It's not my first time
on the rack.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.713
No, no, no, no.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.976
No,
this is more.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.413
This is...

09:52.026 --> 09:54.289
...hope.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.640
Ah.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.295
That's what's
stopping me --

10:00.338 --> 10:01.949
you.

10:01.992 --> 10:05.605
You still think
that Dean and Cass

10:05.648 --> 10:06.780
are gonna
fly through those doors

10:06.823 --> 10:09.260
just in
the nick of time.

10:09.304 --> 10:13.700
You still think that
you're the hero of this story.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.009
You still think
you can win.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.247
I think
we're going around in circles.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.292
We've seen
this corpse before.

10:41.336 --> 10:44.339
No, Dean, my sense of direction
is excellent.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.776
That's a different corpse.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.215
I don't know.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.404
Ugh!

11:08.189 --> 11:09.669
You're right.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.976
It is
a different corpse.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.372
We saw you
following us.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.504
Thought you'd never
make your move.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.854
What do you want?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.725
Well, it's a little embarrassing
saying it loud,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
but we're looking for
a flower.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.728
A flower?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.687
What do I look like,
a florist?

11:29.036 --> 11:31.691
Well, if you can't help us,
see this boom stick?

11:31.734 --> 11:33.736
It's loaded
with Borax-filled shells.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.998
You know
what Borax does

11:35.042 --> 11:36.739
to piranha-faced freaks
like you?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.001
I'd be happy
to show you.

11:38.045 --> 11:41.222
We don't call it
a flower.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.876
There's a blossom.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.705
Grows out of the soil
when we die.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.794
When...Leviathan die?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.709
Dean: Oh, okay.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.188
Cool.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.496
I -- Hey!
The body has to rot.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.845
It can take months.

11:55.889 --> 11:58.848
And then
these blossoms bloom.

11:58.892 --> 12:02.547
10 husks,
bloody red centers.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.767
I know a place.
Not far.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.073
And look at that.

12:06.116 --> 12:07.552
Thought you weren't
a florist.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.771
Get up.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.822
Wait.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.042
You know a vamp around here
named Benny?

12:19.086 --> 12:21.871
Burly guy, Cajun?
No.

12:21.915 --> 12:23.438
Heard of him,
though.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.787
Everybody has.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.615
The guy who got out
and then came back.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.921
Like an idiot.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.227
Pretty much.
Where is he?

12:30.271 --> 12:31.794
Dead.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.014
Long time ago.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
His own kind --
they didn't trust him,

12:35.450 --> 12:39.454
and they -- ksch! --
ripped him apart.

12:39.497 --> 12:42.457
Move.

12:44.285 --> 12:47.592
How do I put this
to you, Sam?

12:47.636 --> 12:50.247
Your hope is...
misplaced.

12:50.291 --> 12:53.250
Now, I'm not saying
you can't win.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.426
I mean,
if you stay firm

12:55.470 --> 12:59.082
and Dean and Cass
don't screw up their part,

12:59.126 --> 13:02.477
with the exact right
roll of the dice...

13:02.520 --> 13:03.826
you could.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.003
But what
I'm saying is...

13:07.047 --> 13:09.179
you don't want to.

13:09.223 --> 13:12.530
You think you do,
but you don't.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.358
Not if you knew.

13:14.402 --> 13:17.448
Not if
you could see what I see.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.451
You want to know what happens
when you win?

13:20.495 --> 13:21.975
Here.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.542
I'll show you.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.897
Whoa.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.337
Find something?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.860
No.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.428
That man who disappeared
in Florida --

13:40.471 --> 13:41.864
Yeah.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.259
Turns out he was eaten
by an alligator.

13:48.044 --> 13:51.352
Hey, Dean, if you're tired,
why don't you go to bed?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.006
I'm not tired.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.704
I'm not tired.
I'm just resting my eyes.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.532
I'm good.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.364
Ooh. Jackpot.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.891
Dean:
Ahh. Thanks.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.416
Alright, well,
I say let's call it, hmm?

14:12.460 --> 14:13.635
Movie night?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.506
I'll make popcorn.

14:17.769 --> 14:18.901
Oh. Jody.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.209
Jody. Hey.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.733
How's it going?

14:24.776 --> 14:26.735
Jody?

14:26.778 --> 14:29.259
Sam...

14:29.303 --> 14:31.522
Yeah. Hey.

14:31.566 --> 14:35.048
It was just supposed to be
a little nest,

14:35.091 --> 14:37.920
maybe three vampires.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.054
Claire and I went in
armed to the teeth,

14:41.097 --> 14:45.362
but there were more.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.539
So many more.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.286
She's dead, Sam.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.684
Claire's dead.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.774
No.

15:10.431 --> 15:12.259
Oh, that was just
the beginning.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.695
No.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.566
This is...

15:15.610 --> 15:17.177
the rest.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.135
The other side
of victory.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.659
What happens next.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.227
You just set it forward
to any day or time,

15:24.271 --> 15:26.142
and you can
see it all.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.797
Nothing you show me...

15:30.320 --> 15:32.932
You cannot
change my mind.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.499
Then it doesn't
change your mind.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.848
Come on, Sam.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.679
Don't you want to see
the future?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.775
Sorry about Benny.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.952
I owed him my life.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.303
And he sacrificed himself
to get Sam out of this place.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.349
Well, this place
will bring that out in you.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.481
Guilt.

16:00.524 --> 16:04.311
It was my fault
the Leviathan got out.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.314
It was my fault
we were here the first time.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.098
I carry that guilt
every day.

16:09.142 --> 16:12.014
I know
you're sorry, Cass.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.191
About Bel,
about Mom.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.672
I was talking
about Jack.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.547
I already apologized
to you.

16:23.591 --> 16:26.072
You just
refused to hear it.

16:26.115 --> 16:28.465
Sorry I brought it up.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.991
Maybe if you didn't just
up and leave us.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.167
You didn't
give me a choice.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.473
You couldn't forgive me.

16:36.517 --> 16:39.650
And you couldn't
move on.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.001
You were too angry.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.613
I left,
but you didn't stop me.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.109
I know
what you're thinking.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.894
But we did
everything we could.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.375
No, we didn't.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.898
We could've
gone in there sooner.

17:09.941 --> 17:13.119
The place was crawling
with wolves.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.511
We had to wait.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.906
And because we waited,
the victims --

17:17.949 --> 17:19.255
they all died.

17:19.299 --> 17:22.084
They bled out
on the floor.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.480
Now,
if Cass was still here,

17:26.523 --> 17:29.700
he could've healed them.Yeah, well, he's not.

17:33.139 --> 17:36.229
Cass?

17:36.272 --> 17:39.101
They're winning,
Sam.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.712
The monsters
are winning.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.114
It's up this way.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.856
Just like I promised.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.252
Leviathan blossom.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.254
Alright, well,
grab one.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.952
Let's get
the hell out of here.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.649
Cass?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.086
It's an angel trap.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.615
You tricked us.Mother's got beef
with you.

18:14.658 --> 18:15.964
Eve.
Eve.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.402
Killing her alphas,
swallowing her Leviathan.

18:19.446 --> 18:22.188
Bringing you to her
should earn us a nice reward.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.451
What do you mean,
"us"?
Dean!

18:26.496 --> 18:29.760
Ugh!

19:03.751 --> 19:06.232
No.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.501
Cass?

19:16.764 --> 19:19.070
Cass!

19:24.685 --> 19:27.253
Dean:
What are you doing?

19:27.296 --> 19:29.298
Come on, man.
We just got back.

19:29.342 --> 19:32.910
I-If we don't hustle,
the nest'll move on.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.740
No, Sam.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.614
It doesn't matter.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.573
What are you saying?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.706
What I've been trying to say
for months.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.363
It's time...

19:50.406 --> 19:52.843
time to stand down.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.889
You want to quit?

19:57.631 --> 20:00.677
What's happened to you,
Dean?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.070
Ever since --

20:02.113 --> 20:04.159
Ever since what?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.988
We lost pretty much everyone
we've ever cared about?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.600
Ever since the Mark
made Cass go crazy?

20:10.644 --> 20:13.255
Ever since I had to bury him
in a Ma'lak box?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.778
Ever since then?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.563
Yeah.
You know why?

20:16.606 --> 20:18.782
'Cause the monsters --
they're everywhere.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.871
Everywhere!

20:20.915 --> 20:23.222
What we do --
it's not even Hunting anymore.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.399
It's whack-a-mole.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.010
We don't even
save people.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.972
Every friend we've ever had
is either dead,

20:35.016 --> 20:38.019
or they got wise
and they packed it in.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.805
Jody's still fighting,
and Bobby --

20:41.849 --> 20:43.590
Bobby has a death wish,
and you know it.

20:43.633 --> 20:47.289
And Jody -- ever since
what happened to Donna

20:47.333 --> 20:51.380
and the girls,
she does, too.

20:51.424 --> 20:54.905
And after Eileen...

20:54.949 --> 20:57.343
so do you.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.434
No.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.306
What happened
to Butch and Sundance?

21:09.616 --> 21:13.315
Dean, what happened to
going out swinging?

21:16.971 --> 21:19.930
We lost, brother.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.631
We lost.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.766
I'm done.

21:36.207 --> 21:38.122
No, no, no.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.733
Dean...

21:42.170 --> 21:44.781
Dean!

21:48.959 --> 21:51.353
This is a lie.

21:53.529 --> 21:57.011
Chuck, I know what you're doing.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.015
Chuck?!

22:01.058 --> 22:04.018
Enjoying the show?

22:08.414 --> 22:11.373
You're just showing me this
so I give up,

22:11.417 --> 22:12.722
so I lose hope.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.681
I'm just
the messenger, Sam.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.205
I'm sharing
my omniscience with you.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.163
No,
the Dean I know...

22:19.207 --> 22:21.296
the Dean
who raised me --

22:21.340 --> 22:22.645
he'd never give up,

22:22.689 --> 22:25.169
no matter
how bad things got.

22:25.213 --> 22:28.172
Well, he does.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.610
He will.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.221
This is the truth,
Sam.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.876
This is
what comes next.

22:40.271 --> 22:43.057
Cass!

22:56.462 --> 22:59.029
No, no, no.

23:12.303 --> 23:15.524
Cass?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.701
Cass, I hope you can hear me...

23:20.486 --> 23:23.706
...that wherever you are,
it's not too late.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.498
I should've stopped you.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.069
You're my best friend,
but I just let you go.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.597
'Cause it was easier
than admitting I was wrong.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.497
I -- Ohh.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.152
I don't know why I get so angry.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.939
I just know --
I know that it's --

24:22.983 --> 24:26.943
i-it's just always been there.

24:26.987 --> 24:32.819
And when things go bad,
it just -- it comes out.

24:32.862 --> 24:36.300
And I can't -- I can't stop it.

24:36.344 --> 24:40.174
No matter how --
how bad I want to,

24:40.217 --> 24:42.959
I just can't stop it.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.528
And -- And I -- I forgive you.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.357
Of course I forgive you.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.363
I'm sorry it took me so long --

24:57.713 --> 25:00.586
I'm sorry it took me till now
to say it.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.896
Cass, I'm -- I'm so sorry.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.641
Man, I hope you can hear me.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.208
I hope you can hear me.

25:26.437 --> 25:29.005
Okay.

25:48.634 --> 25:53.987
I'm raiding that nest
with or without you.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.962
Then I guess
I don't have a choice, do I?

26:19.403 --> 26:22.232
Oh.
They're back.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.772
Oh, Dean, bad idea.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.730
You should've
trusted your...

26:43.210 --> 26:44.646
...gut.

26:44.690 --> 26:48.128
No.
It can't end like this.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.956
See for yourself.

26:49.999 --> 26:53.089
You're holding
the watch.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.449
It's stuck.

27:07.321 --> 27:10.541
Guess that's as far
as it goes, Sammy.

27:12.543 --> 27:16.112
The end of the line.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.832
Dean.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.183
Cass?

27:43.226 --> 27:45.620
You made it.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.752
I made it?

27:53.889 --> 27:55.848
You okay?
I'm fine.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.501
What happened?

27:57.545 --> 27:59.155
They were after me,
not you.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.984
I figured it would be safest
to give myself up.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.464
They take you to Eve?

28:03.507 --> 28:05.553
Yeah.
We were en route.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.251
I waited until I...

28:08.295 --> 28:09.949
saw this.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.734
It got
a little smushed.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.780
Once I had the blossom,

28:14.823 --> 28:16.869
I fought,
caught them off guard.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.697
They fought back.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.264
I managed
to get away.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.526
You did it.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.790
You did it, Cass.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.270
Well,
they're still after me.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.576
We should hurry.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.754
Okay, Cass,
I need to say something.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.278
You don't
have to say it.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.150
I heard your prayer.

28:51.947 --> 28:55.211
Alright,
only way in.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.560
Let 'em come.

28:56.604 --> 28:57.866
We're outnumbered.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.086
What else is new?

29:00.129 --> 29:01.870
Those bastards
take us down,

29:01.914 --> 29:03.742
at least
we go down together.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.569
Butch and Sundance.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.398
Go out swinging.

29:24.501 --> 29:25.938
Hold up.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.941
You sure
you want to do this, Jody?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.769
It's Sam and Dean.

29:57.578 --> 29:58.797
Ahh!

30:00.711 --> 30:02.191
Ahh!

30:12.767 --> 30:13.986
Ahh!

30:14.029 --> 30:17.728
Ahh!

30:29.740 --> 30:32.569
So,
what'd you think?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.491
I'm sorry, kid.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.579
It's a crappy ending.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.886
You and your brother
deserve better.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.757
Yeah, right.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.281
No.
I mean it.

30:48.324 --> 30:52.024
I-It hurts me to see you
go out like that.

30:52.067 --> 30:55.854
Listen, I know our friendship
has seen better days.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.420
But you have to know --

30:57.464 --> 31:00.336
you and your brother
matter to me.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.295
Deeply.

31:02.338 --> 31:05.254
You still do.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.910
I want better
for you both.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.610
Where's Eileen?

31:13.654 --> 31:14.916
She's fine.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.744
I powered her down
in a broom closet.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.224
Don't change
the subject.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.882
You know, Chuck...

31:23.925 --> 31:26.667
I've seen your plans.

31:26.710 --> 31:29.235
Dean and Me,
Cain and Abel.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.194
You don't know
what you saw, Sam.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.066
I know
it didn't look better to me.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.806
Okay, so, that way?

31:35.850 --> 31:37.939
Hmm?
You being monsters?

31:37.983 --> 31:40.594
You being killed off
by your friends?

31:40.637 --> 31:42.683
You really like
that ending better?

31:51.126 --> 31:56.566
Zee-loh-dah-rup,
ah-lahr, zee-zohp,

31:56.610 --> 32:02.964
ah-buh-rah-muh-jzh,
ahm-ee-zuh-pee --

32:03.008 --> 32:04.748
Wait. Wait. Wait.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.054
Are you sure?

32:06.098 --> 32:07.316
Dean, you've already
taken the Mark.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.753
You can't
take it again.

32:09.797 --> 32:12.365
I can.
It's the only way.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.806
Okay.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.431
Because I'm taking
the Mark,

32:35.475 --> 32:38.130
someone else
will have to destroy this.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.784
You or Sam.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.531
It'll be better.

32:48.575 --> 32:51.143
It'll be better.

32:51.186 --> 32:53.275
It'll be better.

32:55.886 --> 32:59.064
If we win --
When we win --

32:59.107 --> 33:03.677
When we beat you,
I will make it better!

33:03.720 --> 33:06.027
You can't, Sam.

33:08.377 --> 33:11.032
You,
Sam Winchester,

33:11.076 --> 33:13.861
have been playing
fast and loose

33:13.904 --> 33:15.471
with the laws
of nature and magic

33:15.515 --> 33:18.692
for a very long time --
you and your brother.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.174
Always breaking
the rules.

33:22.217 --> 33:25.568
And that's what I love
about you, Sam.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.179
It's so heroic.

33:27.222 --> 33:30.878
It's so...Promethean.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.662
But there's still
so much

33:32.706 --> 33:34.882
about the fabric
of the universe

33:34.925 --> 33:37.276
that you don't know...

33:37.319 --> 33:39.713
that you can't know.

33:39.756 --> 33:43.586
'Cause you're only humans.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.067
But I'm God.

33:48.113 --> 33:51.333
Think about
what I showed you.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.987
Look beyond the Mark,

33:53.031 --> 33:55.381
beyond you and Dean
fanging out --

33:55.424 --> 33:59.733
heartbreaking,
but not the headline news.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.915
The monsters.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.093
The monsters.

34:16.097 --> 34:20.058
Without me,
it's a law of nature --

34:20.101 --> 34:24.105
dark forces prevail,
monsters rule,

34:24.149 --> 34:26.238
and you,
your brother,

34:26.281 --> 34:28.979
and everyone you love
will die.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.770
Can you really
live with that?

34:53.874 --> 34:55.919
Dean?

34:55.963 --> 34:57.138
Help. Help me!

34:57.182 --> 35:00.881
Hey.
Where's Chuck?

35:00.924 --> 35:02.839
I don't know.
He's close.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.972
Watch out!

35:11.196 --> 35:13.850
Eileen,
I don't want to hurt you.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.685
Hi, Dean.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.995
You know I had to.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.825
Ugh!

35:31.868 --> 35:35.089
Me, too.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.222
Sam.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.009
Sam, smash it.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.402
Now!

35:49.016 --> 35:50.235
Well, Sam?

35:57.764 --> 35:59.244
Sam!

36:05.075 --> 36:08.557
I can't.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.211
What?

36:10.255 --> 36:12.735
I can't.
I'm sorry. I...

36:14.955 --> 36:16.304
I just can't.

36:16.348 --> 36:19.655
What did you do
to him?

36:22.919 --> 36:24.225
Ahh.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.836
Ahh!

36:26.880 --> 36:29.230
Yeah!
Oh, man.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.884
Whew!

36:30.927 --> 36:33.234
Yeah,
that's the stuff.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.584
What happened?

36:35.628 --> 36:37.760
Chuck: Um,
short version --

36:37.804 --> 36:40.589
Sammy lost hope,
and now I'm free.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.678
Hey,
take it easy on the kid.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.507
It took a lot
to beat it out of him.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.957
No.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.264
No!

37:11.272 --> 37:14.362
Well, what now?

37:16.059 --> 37:17.713
You're not gonna
dust us.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.324
Oh, yeah?

37:19.367 --> 37:20.847
Why not?

37:20.890 --> 37:23.284
Because
you're holding out.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.504
For your big finish.

37:25.547 --> 37:29.290
Yeah, we know about
your galaxy-brained idea,

37:29.334 --> 37:31.684
how you think
this story is gonna go.

37:31.727 --> 37:34.600
Sam got a little look
into your draft folder.

37:34.643 --> 37:37.864
Sam's visions --
they weren't drafts.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.909
They were memories.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.695
My memories.

37:42.738 --> 37:48.091
Other Sams and other Deans
in other worlds.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.919
But guess what.

37:49.963 --> 37:51.269
Just like you,

37:51.312 --> 37:54.315
they didn't think
they'd do it, either.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.099
But they did.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.710
And you will, too.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.062
No.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.241
Not this Sam.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.765
And not this Dean.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.770
So you go back
to Earth 2

38:14.814 --> 38:17.643
and play
with your other toys.

38:17.686 --> 38:20.863
Because we will never give you
the ending that you want.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.742
We'll see.

38:42.058 --> 38:45.061
I wish you'd stay.

38:45.105 --> 38:48.369
I wish I could.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.197
After what happened,

38:50.240 --> 38:54.375
I don't know
what's real anymore.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.835
I know
that was real.

40:12.148 --> 40:13.149
Did she leave?

40:14.629 --> 40:18.372
Yeah. Yeah.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.201
Sorry.

40:23.638 --> 40:28.469
That was our,
uh, chance...

40:28.513 --> 40:32.430
to stop Chuck.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.788
But what Chuck
showed me,

40:42.831 --> 40:46.139
what would happen
if we trapped him --

40:46.182 --> 40:47.706
I believed him.

40:49.664 --> 40:52.580
I still do.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.284
Well,
that's good enough for me.

41:08.422 --> 41:12.165
Okay, uh,
so, what now?

41:13.993 --> 41:18.345
Well,
Chuck's gone, but...

41:18.388 --> 41:21.130
He'll be back.

41:22.567 --> 41:26.571
If we can't kill him
or trap him...

41:30.618 --> 41:34.143
Well,
then we find another way.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.201
It's time.
