00:01.802 --> 00:03.304
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whassup, peeps? You'll recall
 our favorite virgin mother

00:03.337 --> 00:04.305
just heard this bombshell.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.140
Rose is dead.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.276
She can't ever hurt
 you or Mateo.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.710
I couldn't jeopardize
your safety again.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.312
I had to push you away--
 but it's over now.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.380
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Not as thrilled

00:12.413 --> 00:14.148
about Sin Rostro's death--

00:14.182 --> 00:16.184
her former lover, Luisa,

00:16.216 --> 00:18.219
AKA Rafael's sister--
 see, she'd stayed

00:18.252 --> 00:20.654
in contact with Rose...
LUISA: I'm an addict.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.257
I was obsessed-- I just
couldn't let her go.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.725
You should leave.
 And Rafael wasn't

00:24.758 --> 00:26.260
the only one who was bothered

00:26.294 --> 00:27.595
by their relationship.
I can't.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.231
In Luisa's defense,
 breakups are hard--

00:30.264 --> 00:33.101
as Zo and Ro were learning.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.502
I don't want to have
any more kids.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.237
And I know
you want them.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.140
Babies, man-- they're no joke.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.508
Which brings us to Petra.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.843
You see,
 she inseminated herself

00:42.876 --> 00:44.345
with Rafael's sperm
 because she thought

00:44.378 --> 00:45.279
they were meant to be together

00:45.313 --> 00:46.680
Crazy, right?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.782
But he did say he'd be there.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.784
(screams)
 Oh, and speaking of crazy,

00:50.818 --> 00:53.587
all this crime stuff has
 been bad for hotel business.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.457
Can't blame honeymooners for
 avoiding the Marbella, right?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.326
And on the topic
 of honeymooners,

00:58.359 --> 01:01.762
let's get back
 to our love story, shall we?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.197
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:04.232 --> 01:08.436
was exactly 24 years,
 eight months and 17 days old,

01:08.469 --> 01:11.339
she had the most romantic night
 of her life.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.374
Don't think-- just tell me,
do you still love me?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.876
Yes.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.511
It also happened to be
 last night.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.680
Yes?
Yes.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.115
Oh...

01:22.616 --> 01:24.618
*

01:24.652 --> 01:27.321
Does this mean we can be
Facebook friends again?

01:27.355 --> 01:28.689
(laughs): Yes!

01:28.722 --> 01:30.758
I can't believe
you unfriended me.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.461
I had to.
I stalked your girlfriend.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.297
As for what happened next...
That was not
my girlfriend.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.299
We work together.
Your mom is crazy.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.733
Oh...

01:39.767 --> 01:42.403
What about you?
Did you date anyone?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.571
Well, I...

01:43.604 --> 01:45.173
Kinda. Yeah.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.407
My professor.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.809
Well, after exactly
 216 days apart,

01:48.842 --> 01:51.445
they had a lot to catch up on.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.646
He's huge!

01:52.680 --> 01:54.382
The professor?

01:54.415 --> 01:55.783
(relieved sigh)
Oh... Mateo.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
JANE:
It's giving me panic attacks.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.919
He lost his baby face.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.455
Well, pretty sure you're
looking at a baby right now.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.191
(laughs)

02:03.224 --> 02:05.326
(laughing): And then
I challenged McBaskets

02:05.359 --> 02:07.328
to a one-on-one.
Final score?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.696
56 to nothing.
Ooh.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.497
It was a lot closer
than you think.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.500
I almost scored
a bunch of times.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.168
JANE:
 No.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.470
I'msorry.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.506
Yeah, it was awful.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.807
I mean, N...

02:19.840 --> 02:22.376
Nadine died trying to save me.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.345
I can't believe it.
It's because I
didn't trust her.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.647
That's... what haunts me.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.517
I didn't trust her.
JANE:
 Trust me, I was shocked.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.819
And then when the
green card came...

02:31.852 --> 02:33.654
How much crying?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.689
So much crying.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.293
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Come on,

02:39.327 --> 02:42.763
conversation wasn't the only
 thing they had to catch up on.

02:44.232 --> 02:46.500
MICHAEL:
This doesn't feel real.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.302
I know.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.903
But it was.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.307
Just the two of them,
 in their own little bubble.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.509
But we do need to talk
about Rafael.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.710
(bubble pops)

02:56.744 --> 02:58.579
*

03:04.418 --> 03:07.288
I have to apologize.
That's all.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.390
What happened
when I punched him--

03:09.423 --> 03:11.392
I think about that
every day.
 True, for the record.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.528
And I think about how angry
I was, and why...

03:14.562 --> 03:16.297
Rafael had gotten him fired.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.766
...and none of it matters.
I was wrong.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.669
So I just want to apologize
and start fresh.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.836
Great.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.872
But you gotta let me
talk to him first.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.474
And you should
really get going.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.542
Are you kicking me out?
(laughs): No.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.479
My mom and my grandma are
gonna wake up soon, and...

03:31.512 --> 03:33.781
I just don't want to deal
with their opinions yet.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.685
I think it might be
a little too late for that.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.220
*

03:42.690 --> 03:43.724
That's it?

03:43.757 --> 03:44.958
JANE (laughs):
Yes.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.261
We talked.
That's it.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.696
Your mom is a liar.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.631
Ma, don't say
that to him!

03:50.664 --> 03:51.999
Check me out.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.635
Ooh...

03:54.668 --> 03:56.537
Ah...
Wait for it.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.406
It still fits.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.907
I'm actually really excited

03:59.940 --> 04:01.775
to be picking up
a few shifts.
You're seriously trying

04:01.809 --> 04:03.711
to talk to me about
waitressing right now?

04:03.744 --> 04:06.514
What's going on! Are you
back together or not?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.785
Thank you, Abuela.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.757
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 ¿Y tú, Abuela?

04:16.790 --> 04:19.593
Look, as much as I want to
tell you how amazing it was...

04:19.627 --> 04:21.060
So it was amazing.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.663
...I need to talk
to Rafael first.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.798
He and Michael...

04:24.832 --> 04:26.600
I mean, they fought.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.902
I need to make sure that
they can coexist for Mateo.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.371
But don't worry,

04:30.404 --> 04:32.806
I will be talking to him
right away.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.841
(knocking on door)

04:35.042 --> 04:36.910
No, that's Rogelio.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.779
I, um, invited him
to breakfast.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.781
To remind you:
 it's been exactly

04:40.814 --> 04:43.617
12 hours and 41 minutes since
 Xiomara and Rogelio broke up.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.654
XIOMARA: I told you,
you don't have to knock.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.822
You can just come in and out
like you did before.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.325
Thank you. I just wanted
to be respectful.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.726
Mm-hmm.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.664
What?
JANE: Nothing.
I just don't think

04:56.697 --> 04:58.399
we expected you guys
to be so comfortable

04:58.432 --> 04:59.500
with each other
after the breakup.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.369
We decided to be mature
about this.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.504
Exactly. Like my good
friends Gwynnie and Chris,

05:03.537 --> 05:06.106
we have chosen to
consciously uncouple.
But we're not calling it that.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.575
Oh, yes,
we definitely are.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.479
I might be on the board
of Goop, Alba, so yes,

05:11.512 --> 05:12.913
I would say we're
very good friends.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.382
The point is,
we're bypassing

05:14.415 --> 05:15.516
all the negativity

05:15.549 --> 05:17.451
and going straight
to the friendship.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.952
ROGELIO: Exactly.
You're still accompanying me

05:18.986 --> 05:20.588
to the Tiago premiere, right?

05:20.621 --> 05:23.491
Of course.
I already RSVP'd to Paola.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.526
I should check in
on her, actually.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.498
We want to get
a hashtag trending
during the premiere.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.766
Have I told you guys
she used to work for J. Lo?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.568
Sí.
Yes.
Yes. Like, a couple of times.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.504
Like, I remember,
the last time you told me
Yeah. We heard.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.905
was just this morning
on the phone.
Yeah. That's right.

05:37.938 --> 05:38.939
Yep.
You texted it

05:38.972 --> 05:40.040
to me yesterday.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.575
Anyway, what I love about her

05:41.609 --> 05:43.577
is that she won't reveal
a single secret.

05:43.611 --> 05:47.481
Which is... also what I hate
about her. (chuckles)

05:52.520 --> 05:53.821
JANE:
And I have to go.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.123
And I'm really impressed
by the way you two

05:56.156 --> 05:57.658
are handling
the breakup.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.794
Bye.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.597
MAN: Rediscover the romance,
 and the magic,

06:03.631 --> 06:05.433
at the Marbella.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.568
It's a slice of heaven.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.969
Or hell.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.505
The Marbella Hotel.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
You check in,
but you never check out.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.576
Okay, seriously?
This is now the first thing

06:15.609 --> 06:17.010
that comes up
when you Google us?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.046
Yes! It has
half a million hits.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.181
(sighs)
I've made a call
to our marketing people

06:21.214 --> 06:23.451
and asked them to brainstorm
new ad campaign ideas.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.918
You think that's
necessary?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.087
Only if you want
to continue having guests.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.757
Yes, it's necessary!
And I want it done this week!

06:29.790 --> 06:31.692
Whoa. Why so soon?
I don't know, Rafael.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.661
You know, maybe just knowing
that two actual human beings

06:33.694 --> 06:36.096
are about to blast
out of my body at any moment

06:36.129 --> 06:38.732
has give me a sense of urgency.
Okay, first of all,

06:38.766 --> 06:41.435
"blast" out of your body?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.437
Wow.
Look, I just mean
there's a lot

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
I want to get done before then--
I made a list.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.907
Ah.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.542
What?

06:48.576 --> 06:49.877
This happened with Jane.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.745
It's called nesting.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.614
It's when an expectant
mother becomes obsessed

06:53.647 --> 06:55.616
with planning out
all the details.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.619
Feathering her nest,
so to speak.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.455
In anticipation
of the baby.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.991
Are you serious
with that crap?

07:04.024 --> 07:07.695
Ask me what's on my list!

07:07.728 --> 07:10.498
What's on your list?
Night nurse interviews,
finalizing the nursery plans,

07:10.531 --> 07:12.633
and making a new
non-throat-slashing commercial

07:12.666 --> 07:13.734
for the Marbella!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.802
Got it.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.769
I'm on it.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.870
All of it.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.138
Thank you.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.040
(woman screams on video)

07:20.073 --> 07:22.710
MAN:
 Our luxurious honeymoon suites
 are to die for.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.711
(Lina shrieks)

07:23.744 --> 07:25.145
I can't believe it!

07:25.178 --> 07:26.747
(laughter)

07:26.780 --> 07:28.148
Oh. (gasps)
(gasps)

07:28.181 --> 07:31.118
You just made my job a
thousand percent more fun.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.120
Oh, it's nice to be back.
(sighs)

07:33.153 --> 07:34.822
It's familiar, you know?

07:34.855 --> 07:37.057
It's, like, my old life...
Yeah. So quick update.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.693
Mm.
We no longer hate
Busboy Ben.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.895
Uh-huh.
Turns out he was just
in a bad relationship

07:41.929 --> 07:44.965
that made him cranky,
which I found out after
I slept with him.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.967
Oh. Okay, good to know.
Mm-hmm. Anyway,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.236
now all of our hate is
reserved for "Vests,"

07:49.269 --> 07:51.739
the world's worst boss.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.507
Who's approaching.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.742
Hey, Scott.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.814
Uh, actually, I go
by Mr. Archuletta,
now that I'm manager.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.683
Seriously?
I told you.
You might want

08:02.716 --> 08:05.152
to shut it down, Lina--
because we have a problem.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.521
I know you've been stealing
liquor from the bar.
LINA: What?!

08:07.555 --> 08:09.957
I haven't stolen anything.
You were closing up last night

08:09.990 --> 08:12.526
when the bottles went missing,
and you were clearly drunk.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.963
(laughs):
Okay. I do not appreciate

08:15.996 --> 08:18.832
being accused of a crime
I did not commit,

08:18.866 --> 08:19.767
and I will use

08:19.800 --> 08:20.901
every legal recourse

08:20.934 --> 08:22.269
to fight these accusations,

08:22.302 --> 08:23.937
and then I will file
a counterclaim

08:23.971 --> 08:26.840
against you and the hotel,
and then you'll find yourself

08:26.874 --> 08:28.642
up to your eyeballs
in legal bills!

08:29.677 --> 08:30.978
I know it was you.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.080
Just figuring out
how to prove it.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.884
Okay, someone's
 Good Wife binge
 really paid off.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.951
I know.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.821
But, Jane... I didn't do it.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.823
So you weren't drinking at work.
Oh, of course
I was drinking at work.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.094
But ever since they
put in the new rules,
I bring my own booze.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.864
(groans): Oh...
I can't lose my job, Jane.

08:50.898 --> 08:54.134
Busboy Ben will definitely
go back to his girlfriend
if I'm not around.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.036
Okay. Calm down.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.271
(exhales)
We'll figure
it out.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.108
If you didn't do it, then
you're not losing your job.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.743
I have to go to work.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.745
No, you don't.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.580
I do.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.916
I feel okay.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.918
Where's my jacket?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.821
Oh. I got it.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.891
Thank you.
And thank you

09:17.925 --> 09:20.260
for taking care
of me last night.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.931
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To give some context--

09:23.964 --> 09:26.734
it's been exactly
 14 hours and 53 minutes

09:26.767 --> 09:29.837
since Luisa's ex-lover
 lay dead in front of her.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.641
(gasps)
No!

09:33.674 --> 09:35.142
Also...

09:35.175 --> 09:38.812
394 days
 since Luisa has had a drink.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.681
*

09:40.714 --> 09:43.216
Well... until last night.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.787
12 steps forward,
 one step back.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.388
And now this step.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.390
Jane, you'll recall,
 had decided to tell Rafael

09:50.423 --> 09:52.926
about Michael
 as soon as possible.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.095
(exhales)

09:55.128 --> 09:58.098
Shh, shh.
Mateo's still sleeping.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.100
Look what I got him
for his first swim lesson.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.935
So cute, right?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.937
Raf, I have to talk to you
about Michael.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.641
Oh, wow.
 So not even a little lead up?

10:07.675 --> 10:09.777
What about him?

10:09.810 --> 10:12.713
Well, he didn't want
to be around me or the baby

10:12.746 --> 10:14.982
while Rose was out there...

10:15.015 --> 10:16.684
but now...

10:16.717 --> 10:18.986
What?
Now...

10:20.220 --> 10:22.990
...she's gone and we're safe.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
He still loves me.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.228
And I still love him.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.864
No.

10:30.898 --> 10:31.865
What?

10:31.899 --> 10:34.434
Come on, anyone but him.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.137
I don't love anybody else.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.873
He punched me in the face.
I know.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.042
In front of Mateo.
And he feels bad.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.278
Oh, he feels bad?
Okay, so what I mean
is that he wants to apologize.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.949
He's different.
And you turned him in.
So that makes it okay?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.051
No, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying.
He's a bad guy.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.053
No, he's not.
Well, he's bad
for our family,

10:53.086 --> 10:54.955
and I want nothing to do
with him, okay?

10:54.988 --> 10:58.692
Are you serious?
What?

10:58.726 --> 11:01.028
Petra covered up for the fact
that her mom pushed

11:01.061 --> 11:03.063
my grandmother down the stairs,
and I threw her

11:03.096 --> 11:05.465
a freaking baby shower.
And now you're telling me

11:05.498 --> 11:07.968
you can't even have lunch
with Michael?
Fine.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.869
Let's all have lunch.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.204
Great! I look forward to it!

11:11.238 --> 11:13.406
Spoiler alert:

11:13.440 --> 11:14.908
I don't believe them.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.949
So, he agreed to lunch,
at least.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.450
And I use the term "agreed"
loosely.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.452
He definitely wasn't happy
about it.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.154
Yeah, well, it'd be weird
if he was.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.923
Yeah. That's true.
It's gonna be hard, obviously.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.325
I have to apologize.
Yeah.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.460
Any thoughts on what you'd say?

11:33.493 --> 11:34.862
Huh?
Because you can...

11:34.895 --> 11:35.996
try it out on me.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.931
No.
Michael.

11:37.965 --> 11:38.498
Your toast at Mark's wedding?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.167
Oh. Come on.

11:40.200 --> 11:40.968
What were your opening lines?
Let that go.

11:41.001 --> 11:41.835
Oh, yeah:
"For the longest time,

11:41.869 --> 11:45.072
"I thought Mark
was dating his sister."

11:45.105 --> 11:46.339
Who cuddles with their sister?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.841
(chuckles)

11:47.875 --> 11:49.943
Let's talk about this later,
okay?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.245
I love you.
Yeah, I love you, too.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.016
Anyone ever tell you you
got a goofy grin, Cordero?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.818
Hey. What are you doing here?

11:57.851 --> 11:58.952
You should be home
in bed.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.320
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To remind you,

12:00.353 --> 12:03.323
it had been 15 hours
 and 32 minutes

12:03.356 --> 12:04.925
since Sin Rostro
 threatened her family.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.760
We have to figure out
where Mutter is,

12:06.794 --> 12:09.830
how she got ahead of us
and how she killed Rose.

12:11.965 --> 12:15.035
This is what we got so far.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.540
I...

12:20.573 --> 12:23.543
I was sent here
from Internal Affairs.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.213
To investigate you.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.816
Yeah.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.051
I figured that one out.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.086
A while ago.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.088
I understand now...

12:35.122 --> 12:37.224
how Rose got to you,

12:37.257 --> 12:40.460
how she manipulated you.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.530
JANE:
 I want to be with Michael.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.933
With Michael. And he loves me.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.401
He loves me.
 I want to be with Michael.
PETRA: Rafael.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.304
Rafael!
Sorry. Yes.

12:51.338 --> 12:54.107
Yes? You like
the synchronized swimmers.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.042
Hmm?

12:55.075 --> 12:57.077
For the commercial!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.946
WOMAN:
Like I was saying,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.480
it's Old Hollywood glamour

13:00.513 --> 13:02.149
with a touch of Miami magic.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.551
We'd be selling
the fantasy.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.554
Okay, what is going on with you?
I'm sorry.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.390
Jane just told me she's getting
back together with Michael,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.860
and I...

13:12.893 --> 13:14.895
I guess I'm still processing.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.363
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should
 be noted that Petra was feeling

13:16.396 --> 13:19.399
many mixed emotions.
 On one hand...

13:24.337 --> 13:26.339
On the other hand...

13:28.341 --> 13:30.477
Meaning she really had
 to get things checked off

13:30.510 --> 13:32.880
her freaking list.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.083
Okay. Well,
are you done processing?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.517
Can we move on with
the commercial now?

13:37.550 --> 13:40.053
Yes. Of course.
Also,

13:40.087 --> 13:41.054
I'm scheduling
night nurse appointments

13:41.088 --> 13:42.155
for the day after tomorrow.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.223
Terrific.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.925
ROGELIO:
 Beyond terrific.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.559
It's incredible.

13:46.593 --> 13:47.928
While we've
been eating,

13:47.961 --> 13:49.529
Paola secured
the hologram of Selena

13:49.562 --> 13:51.164
to do
a one-night-only performance

13:51.198 --> 13:53.466
at the Tiago premiere.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.040
JANE:
Well done, Paola.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.143
It was nothing. Anyway,
we should get going,

14:03.176 --> 14:05.212
Mr. de la Vega. You have to be
at the set in half an hour.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.448
Oh, and you need to call
Antonio Banderas back.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.118
He called me?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.520
No. But you told me
to practice dropping names.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.889
Oh, Paola,
that was so convincing.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.058
Bien, Paola.
Nice to meet

14:18.091 --> 14:19.859
you all.
Nice to meet you.

14:24.331 --> 14:27.167
Ah...

14:28.201 --> 14:29.436
What?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.504
Nothing. Just...

14:31.538 --> 14:33.974
nice to see now that you're
single you're dating Dad.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.642
Stop! You're being ridiculous.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.144
We're just worried
about you, that's all.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.545
And we want to make sure

14:38.578 --> 14:39.913
that you're okay seeing
Rogelio this much.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.048
I'm fine.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.383
You have nothing to worry about.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.385
Okay. Good.
Just checking in.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.321
Good-bye, sweet boy.
(kissing)

14:48.355 --> 14:49.656
Thanks for putting him down.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.224
I'm gonna be late tonight.
I'm closing.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.162
It's for a good cause.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.163
Mm.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.199
(loud crunching)
Shh!

14:59.232 --> 15:02.102
Okay, in case you didn't notice,
we're on a stakeout.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.171
The liquor thief
is never going to show up

15:04.204 --> 15:06.173
if he hears
your loud snacking.
Really?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.707
It's the snacks
that'll tip them off?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.442
Not your extremely loud voice?

15:09.476 --> 15:12.079
And we're not on a stakeout.
We're just very casually

15:12.112 --> 15:14.081
and quietly closing the lounge.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.949
You know, should
the thief show up

15:15.983 --> 15:17.584
while we're doing it,
then...
(gasps) Shh, shh, shh.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.020
Come, come. Look.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.424
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yep. Good old Luisa.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.359
Oh, no.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.596
(gasps)
Hey!

15:29.629 --> 15:31.564
(exhales) How's
that adorable nephew

15:31.598 --> 15:33.133
of mine?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.434
What's going on?

15:34.467 --> 15:37.337
You know, same old, same old.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.339
With the alcohol.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.741
I thought you
were sober.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.744
I...

15:44.777 --> 15:47.580
I was, and...

15:47.614 --> 15:49.582
I...
(sighs)

15:49.616 --> 15:53.186
I've had a hell
of a tough week, Jane, and...

15:53.220 --> 15:55.488
I messed up.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.291
Actually, um...

15:58.325 --> 16:00.293
I'm glad you caught me.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.096
I don't want to do this.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.732
Just...

16:05.765 --> 16:07.167
just do me a favor. Um...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.569
don't tell my brother.
Let me tell him.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.571
Who cares who tells him?
What about me?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.573
Our boss thinks
Lina stole it.

16:13.606 --> 16:17.244
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'll fix it.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.346
I can't fix it
if you don't stay still.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.181
I'm sorry, Paola.
Mm-hmm.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.051
You know, Paola, most men would
feel intimidated by a kilt,

16:24.084 --> 16:25.252
but I have been fortunate enough

16:25.285 --> 16:27.720
to be blessed
with incredible legs.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.422
Indeed, Mr. de la Vega.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.258
So, was J.Lo a fan
of Braveheart?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.326
She seems like she would be.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.163
You know, I'm not
at liberty to say.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.099
Okay. You're done.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.467
Go get your Spanx on.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.302
Hmm.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.304
My lucky lavender briefs
are folded in half.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.139
I always fold them in quarters.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.209
Maybe the wardrobe department
came in here for some reason,

16:49.242 --> 16:51.211
no?
We'll ask them
immediately.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.247
And then we should report this
incident to studio security.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.782
Don't you think
that's a bit extreme?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.350
Mm-mm.
What's going on?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.285
What...
Okay.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.553
I'm telling you this only

17:00.587 --> 17:03.290
because it's a matter
of safety.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.291
Something very similar happened

17:05.325 --> 17:08.494
on Maid in Manhattan
to you-know-who.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.329
(gasps)
And it turned out
to be a stalker.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.265
What?

17:12.299 --> 17:13.465
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Uh-oh. Remember this?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.702
I told my pen pal Lola.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.238
Lola is in prison, so it's not
like she's going to do anything

17:18.271 --> 17:22.275
with my secrets. She won't be
out for another ten years.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.746
J.Lo had a stalker?

17:26.779 --> 17:29.282
Focus, Rogelio.

17:29.316 --> 17:33.220
The point is we need
to take this very seriously.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.687
JANE:
 Be careful.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.356
Don't let him trap you
in an argument. And be prepared

17:36.389 --> 17:38.358
to do some groveling.
Totally prepared to grovel.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.693
And, of course,
no touching,

17:40.727 --> 17:43.430
no long loving looks,
and definitely no inside jokes.
Okay,

17:43.463 --> 17:46.133
so, impressions, goofy faces,

17:46.166 --> 17:48.101
off-limits.
Yes. Like they always are.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.269
Okay.
And the fact that I laugh
at your goofy faces

17:49.302 --> 17:50.537
means it's an inside joke,

17:50.570 --> 17:52.205
so it's doubly off-limits.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.840
So I shouldn't give him one
of these?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.442
(laughing):
No. No.
What about one of these?

17:55.475 --> 17:58.445
No. Not that one either.
No, don't you dare.
Mateo?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.213
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
Don't do it. Please don't do it.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.348
I have to.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.451
I wanted to apologize.
Sincerely.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.154
Uh, it was a bad
situation all around.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.589
And now, with some
distance, I understand

18:09.622 --> 18:13.660
how you must have felt. And as
for, you know, what happened,

18:13.693 --> 18:15.428
me punching you,

18:15.462 --> 18:17.430
I'm not asking you
to forgive me for that,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.699
but I hope
you can accept my apology.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.835
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wow. Humble and sincere.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.137
This was exactly
 the apology speech

18:24.171 --> 18:25.672
Jane wanted Michael to give.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.475
Which makes sense,
 considering she wrote it.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.877
I got it.

18:30.910 --> 18:34.347
So, is there anything else
you want to say?

18:34.381 --> 18:36.683
Sure. I don't like you,

18:36.716 --> 18:39.619
I don't trust you, and I don't
want you anywhere near my son.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.255
For the record, not what
 she would have scripted.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.523
Look, I know that
you're upset, I...
Because you
won't leave us alone.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.525
Rafael.
You're like a cockroach--
you just

18:45.558 --> 18:47.727
keep coming back
where you don't belong.
All right, you know what,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.696
just to be clear, I do belong
here, because Jane chose me.
Oh, really?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.498
Yes. That's what this is
about, huh? You're jealous.
She chose you?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.466
I'm jealous?
Okay, you know what,
Yeah.
Seriously?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.835
we're done here.

18:55.868 --> 18:56.869
All right.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.916
ROGELIO: Hi, there.
(startled shout)

19:09.949 --> 19:11.484
Sorry.
Didn't see you.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.852
No problem.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.754
I'm meeting your mom
to run some lines.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.890
Are you okay?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.859
Look, I want to tell
you what's happening,

19:19.892 --> 19:22.829
but you have to promise
to stay calm, okay?

19:22.862 --> 19:24.564
Of course.
I'm serious, Dad.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.334
No matter how excited you get.
Say no more.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.269
Luckily, I'm an actor,
blessed with the ability

19:29.302 --> 19:31.538
to keep in total control
of my emotions.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.773
Go ahead.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.544
Michael and I want
to get back together.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.911
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 To be clear,

19:38.945 --> 19:40.380
that's how he was
 on the outside.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.382
On the inside...

19:42.415 --> 19:44.551
(shouting)

19:44.584 --> 19:47.287
Everything's gonna go well!
The bromance is coming back.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.855
The bromance, the bromance...

19:48.888 --> 19:51.924
bromance... the bromance...

19:51.958 --> 19:54.794
You don't say.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.829
But I don't think
it's gonna work.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.367
Interesting.
What's, uh, holding you back?

20:00.400 --> 20:03.936
He and Rafael hate each other,
and Rafael won't let go of that.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.938
And-and I don't want that kind
of animosity around Mateo.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.275
I mean, that is so important.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.876
But so is true love, Jane.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.444
I mean, I'm sorry,
but it is.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.912
And it's rare.
It's so rare.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.982
What you and Michael have
and what me and Xo have...

20:19.051 --> 20:20.787
Dad...

20:20.820 --> 20:22.021
Well, fine.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.023
It also applies to us.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.026
Which is why... well, you see,

20:27.059 --> 20:30.029
we're not willing to walk away
from each other.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.832
Yeah, but what
about the kid issue?

20:32.865 --> 20:37.036
I don't know. Perhaps she'll
change her mind, you know?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.339
(phone buzzing)

20:39.372 --> 20:40.673
Studio security.
I have to take this.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.411
Hello?

20:44.444 --> 20:45.912
What?!

20:45.945 --> 20:47.280
Nope.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.948
No, I've never seen this woman.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.950
She did a little
extra work here.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.819
We found her in
possession of these.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.288
Which your assistant Paola
has identified as

20:55.322 --> 20:57.290
your second favorite
lucky briefs.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.527
Thank you, Paola.
Very much.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.364
Please have these laundered,
with a gentle press.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.266
They've been through
enough.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.878
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, no.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.848
Looks like they sniffed out
 the wrong stalker.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.583
Where are you?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.685
I'm running late for swim class.
What?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.620
We have night nurse
interviews.
Now?

21:27.654 --> 21:28.921
Yes! You said
swim class was at 1:00.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.022
I am so sorry.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.424
It moved and I forgot
to tell you.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.692
Can they reschedule?

21:32.725 --> 21:33.993
They're here.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.062
You know what? Forget it.
I'll just decide.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.697
Pet...
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, dear.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.732
From one angry baby mama

21:39.766 --> 21:41.601
to another.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.604
Yup, this is gonna be fun.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.406
Hey, Mr. Sweetface,

21:46.439 --> 21:48.875
do you like your first
swim lesson? Yes?

21:48.908 --> 21:50.009
Hey.
Hi.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.011
Okay, swim parents,

21:52.044 --> 21:54.914
so for the first five minutes,
we're just gonna get our babies

21:54.947 --> 21:56.949
used to the water,
all right?
Five minutes-- that's certainly

21:56.983 --> 21:58.718
a lot longer
than you lasted at lunch.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.086
Are we seriously
gonna do this now?

22:00.119 --> 22:00.953
We were supposed
to do it yesterday

22:00.987 --> 22:02.054
but you didn't even try.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.556
So if you want,

22:03.590 --> 22:04.591
you can blow bubbles...
(spluttering)

22:04.624 --> 22:06.793
I did try. I showed up.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.794
You didn't.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.095
(spluttering)

22:09.128 --> 22:11.063
You were angry and
defensive and...
Yeah!

22:11.097 --> 22:11.764
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God,

22:11.798 --> 22:13.500
is he doing it?
Oh, my God!

22:13.533 --> 22:14.834
Is he blowing
a bubble?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.135
You're a little Michael Phelps!
Yeah, he is.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.705
Yes, you are.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.907
Just move your kiddo
around the pool,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.909
take 'em on a little
boat ride, so they see

22:22.942 --> 22:24.544
what that feels like.

22:28.548 --> 22:33.886
Yes... Oh...

22:33.920 --> 22:34.987
Okay...

22:35.021 --> 22:36.923
maybe I am
a little jealous.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.024
But that's not
what this is about.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.659
This is about Mateo's safety

22:39.692 --> 22:40.927
Which is why
Michael stayed away.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.128
But now that
the threat is gone...

22:42.161 --> 22:43.162
But it's not.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.664
Look, time and time again,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.733
Michael made these
really dangerous choices

22:46.766 --> 22:48.735
because of his job.
You know that's true.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.515
Is this okay?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.150
Don't be silly.
Of course.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.118
I mean, it's just acting, right?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.455
Right.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.508
I-It says that you're supposed
to lust after my breasts,

23:28.541 --> 23:30.009
not my shoulder.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.644
Of course. (clears throat)

23:58.170 --> 24:00.206
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wait, what?!

24:00.239 --> 24:02.441
Hey! You guys are off script!

24:08.648 --> 24:10.717
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes, here we are.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.085
Approximately 62 hours
 and 25 minutes

24:13.119 --> 24:14.921
since these two broke up.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.123
Stuff like this always
happens after a breakup.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.226
I'm sure Gwyneth and Chris
have done this numerous times.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.061
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.630
Consciously uncoupled coitus.

24:23.663 --> 24:24.964
(door closes, Xiomara gasps)

24:24.997 --> 24:27.066
Jane's home.
Quick, get up, get dressed!

24:27.099 --> 24:28.768
What... Why?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.970
I just don't want to hear
her opinions right now.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.138
Ma?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.173
XIOMARA:
Uh, hey, honey.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.009
Hurry up.
What's taking so long?

24:37.043 --> 24:38.678
These pants are on
the snug side, but David Beckham

24:38.711 --> 24:39.846
told me I could pull them off.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.183
(thump)

24:44.216 --> 24:45.918
What was that?

24:45.952 --> 24:47.086
XIOMARA:
Just dropped my shoe.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.688
All good.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.791
Hm.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.528
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Whew! That was close.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.148
Whatcha doin'?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.751
Oh, you know... Ah.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.620
I'm just waking up from a nap.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.221
Oh, are you not feeling well?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.256
'Cause you look
a little sweaty.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.893
Oh, it's... You know,
it's hot. Miami.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.261
Mm. Because...

25:29.295 --> 25:32.264
that is one wild...

25:32.298 --> 25:33.866
nap.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.302
Oh. Maybe...

25:36.335 --> 25:39.138
Liar! I saw Dad sneaking out
of the house like a teenager.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.942
Okay, look, look,
it was just ex-sex.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.911
Oh...
It's a totally
normal thing that

25:44.944 --> 25:46.979
everyone does
after they break up.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.748
Well, everyone except for you.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.950
It doesn't change anything.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.586
It's over.
We both know it.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.721
But Mom...
No, no. No.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.955
No lectures.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.590
This is not
a lecture.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.292
Dad is holding out hope.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.294
He thinks you might
change your mind.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.730
About kids.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.864
He does?

26:07.266 --> 26:08.901
I won't.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.169
I know.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.204
Wow.

26:15.174 --> 26:18.077
I-I really thought
we were in sync.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.987
RAFAEL:
They're gonna be great.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.922
PETRA:
Yes, they are.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.359
What's wrong?

26:33.392 --> 26:35.227
If me and my daughters

26:35.261 --> 26:36.996
are going to be
second-class citizens,

26:37.029 --> 26:39.331
you need to tell me
so I can be prepared.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.332
Second-class?

26:40.366 --> 26:42.234
To Jane and Mateo.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.770
You won't.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.237
We are now.

26:45.271 --> 26:48.107
And look, I know

26:48.140 --> 26:50.076
you didn't choose
this pregnancy.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.343
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 That's an understatement.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.313
But you did agree to be there.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.916
And if that's changed,
I need to know.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.317
No.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.853
I will be there.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.956
And I'm sorry
for making you feel that way.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.263
Okay, what is going on?
With the synchronized
swimmers?

27:11.297 --> 27:12.799
They're filming
a commercial.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.667
No, with Vests.
He just fired me.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.669
What?
What?
Luisa asked me to replace

27:16.703 --> 27:18.337
some bottles and he saw me
putting them back and now

27:18.370 --> 27:20.239
he thinks I stole them.
Don't worry.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.675
I'm calling her and
we are fixing this right now.

27:22.709 --> 27:26.045
Hola, Jane. Como esta?

27:26.078 --> 27:28.247
Luisa? Where are you?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.416
Just hanging out.
What about you?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.118
She's drunk.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.452
I am not!
Are you okay?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.287
Tell me where you are,
I'll come get you.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.323
(pop song playing
over phone)

27:39.258 --> 27:41.828
(same pop song playing,
louder and clearer)

27:41.861 --> 27:43.262
She's in the lounge.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.297
*

27:51.070 --> 27:52.371
(sighs, then gasps)

27:54.440 --> 27:57.076
Stay cool.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.978
I'm gonna count to three,

27:59.011 --> 28:01.147
then you guys are
gonna stand up.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.883
I'm gonna slip away.
(whooshes)

28:03.916 --> 28:07.353
One, two, three.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.162
I only had one drink.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.065
And five shots.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.100
And two shots.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.935
I'm sorry.

28:22.969 --> 28:24.470
Please don't take me
back to the Marbella.

28:24.503 --> 28:27.173
Luisa, you're in the Marbella.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.975
(gasps)

28:29.008 --> 28:30.309
I'm sorry.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.244
Sorry.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.114
I didn't mean to slip.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.415
(sighs)
Did you tell my brother?

28:36.448 --> 28:37.784
No. Did you?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.118
Yeah.
Luisa.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.187
Mm? Okay, no.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.189
Just, I didn't tell him

28:43.222 --> 28:46.725
because he's gonna be
so disappointed in me.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.730
I know, but still,
you have to tell him.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.733
Can I call my sponsor first?

28:56.202 --> 28:57.436
(exhales)

28:57.469 --> 28:59.471
Ay... Mm.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.110
Are you Luisa's sponsor?

29:04.143 --> 29:07.113
No.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.250
Oh... But look,
I'll take care of her.

29:11.283 --> 29:14.887
When she wakes up, she should
probably talk to her brother.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.389
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of big
 scary talks...

29:17.423 --> 29:19.291
We can't do this anymore--

29:19.325 --> 29:23.195
act like we didn't
break up, because...

29:23.229 --> 29:25.497
we're really just putting
off the inevitable.

29:25.531 --> 29:29.401
I'm not gonna change my mind
about having kids.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.103
Jane told you?

29:31.137 --> 29:32.571
Yeah, she did.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.407
But it was good,
it-it helped me see.

29:35.441 --> 29:39.145
We're not gonna feel broken up
unless we take a step back.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.913
Not see each other as much.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.049
So...

29:43.082 --> 29:46.085
maybe take Jane
to the Tiago premiere?

29:49.588 --> 29:51.790
(text alert whooshes)

29:57.596 --> 29:58.797
(laughs)

30:22.054 --> 30:23.522
Uh... uh...

30:23.555 --> 30:24.623
(phone rings)

30:24.656 --> 30:26.125
Michael,

30:26.158 --> 30:27.493
you can't.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.861
You're more important.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.863
I'm not losing you again, Jane.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.132
I told you the other night
that I would do

30:33.165 --> 30:34.500
anything to make this work,

30:34.533 --> 30:36.335
and if that's losing my job

30:36.368 --> 30:38.437
versus losing you, then...

30:38.470 --> 30:39.571
you win out,

30:39.605 --> 30:42.074
every single time.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.283
JANE: He loves his job.
How can I let him quit?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.219
It's not really
your choice, right?

30:53.252 --> 30:56.455
I mean, if he loves you
enough to...

30:56.488 --> 30:59.058
to sacrifice
something like that,

30:59.091 --> 31:01.093
i-it's up to him.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.999
Mom?

31:08.600 --> 31:10.402
(gasping):
Oh,

31:10.436 --> 31:11.370
my...

31:11.403 --> 31:14.373
Hon, you look beautiful.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.376
I'm glad you're going
to the premiere with your dad.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.410
But are you okay?

31:18.444 --> 31:20.679
Yes, I'm
totally fine.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.681
I'm gonna
order Chinese,

31:22.714 --> 31:24.483
fire up the DVR...

31:24.516 --> 31:27.419
I'm looking forward
to just relaxing.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.955
Go on.

31:30.622 --> 31:34.560
No, no, I don't want the
gluten-free, MSG-free egg rolls.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.129
I know that's my normal order.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.431
Just the regular
egg rolls tonight.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.467
For one.

31:52.278 --> 31:54.413
This British telenovela
is not that original.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.382
We did the Egyptian
deflowering the virgin

31:56.415 --> 31:58.650
then dying in her bed
on Amor de Arabia.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.419
Stop talking
and pay attention.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.954
This part's important.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.124
What?!
I assume?

32:05.157 --> 32:07.493
You watched this
without me?!
I'm sorry.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.428
I'm sorry.
No, no.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.563
That is, like, a fundamental
relationship rule.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.266
You wait before moving
forward on your DVR.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.536
(both laughing)

32:22.108 --> 32:23.442
(sighing)

32:23.475 --> 32:24.476
Forgot my phone.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.283
Mom? Are you okay?

32:31.317 --> 32:34.553
Sorry. Yeah.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.022
(gasps)

32:36.055 --> 32:37.689
I just don't know whether or not

32:37.723 --> 32:40.226
to start episode eight, because

32:40.259 --> 32:42.528
we were watching it
together, you know, and...

32:42.561 --> 32:44.430
Oh.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.565
Oh.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.268
(crying): And don't want to
move ahead without him.

32:50.602 --> 32:51.503
But I want to know
what happened

32:51.537 --> 32:53.305
to Lady Sybil, you know?

32:53.339 --> 32:54.773
Yeah, I know, Mom.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.477
(crying)
I know.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.080
Jane should be arriving
any minute.
No problem.

33:01.113 --> 33:04.583
We're a little
ahead of schedule.

33:04.616 --> 33:09.288
But listen, I've been thinking
about your stalker situation.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.489
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'll remind you,

33:10.522 --> 33:12.158
this is his stalker situation.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.295
And I'm concerned.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.397
Stalkers can be
really dangerous.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.333
I've set up
security on set,

33:21.367 --> 33:23.402
but what's your
situation like at home?

33:23.435 --> 33:25.204
Do you have a dead bolt?

33:25.237 --> 33:27.439
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No, don't tell her, Rogelio.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.441
No. I lost the key.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.343
Weapons?

33:31.377 --> 33:33.545
Just the mace I keep
in my underwear drawer.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.780
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 This is torture!

33:34.813 --> 33:37.149
Okay, how about

33:37.183 --> 33:39.418
a password-protected
security system?

33:39.451 --> 33:41.353
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'm shaking tables over here.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.322
Password's the same
as every other password.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.358
Rogelio, or, "Rogelio1"
if a number is needed.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.496
Hmm. Oh, it's Jane.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.064
Um...

34:05.544 --> 34:07.646
You okay?

34:09.447 --> 34:11.583
Yeah. Yes.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.719
Jane is running late.
Her mom was upset.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.589
Oh, God, are you always going
to be a second-class citizen?

34:17.623 --> 34:20.192
What?
I'm sorry.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.094
I shouldn't speak
out of turn.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.230
No, it's okay.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.167
This is a big night for you.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.636
That's all.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.572
I wish Jane
turned up for you.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.510
Anyway, you should
walk the carpet.
Yeah.

34:38.543 --> 34:42.414
(reporters clamoring,
cameras clicking)

34:51.523 --> 34:53.792
LUISA:
 I just feel so alone.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.795
My parents are dead...

34:56.828 --> 34:59.231
my brother hates me...

34:59.265 --> 35:01.700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 The love of her life died
 in front of her.

35:01.733 --> 35:06.538
So when this little voice
tells me to drink,

35:06.572 --> 35:10.676
even just one,
to take the edge off...

35:10.709 --> 35:13.279
Well, I don't have
a little voice.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.548
I have a big voice.

35:16.582 --> 35:19.718
You need to go
back to rehab.

35:20.919 --> 35:23.455
So that when you're out,

35:23.489 --> 35:25.691
and you're better...

35:29.895 --> 35:33.332
...I can take you out.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.668
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At last, a step forward.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.672
Which brings us here, now.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.609
Hey, Dad.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.612
I've been
looking for you.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.647
Why aren't you at
the after party?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.582
I just needed some air.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.918
Well, Tiago was great.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.421
I-I'm, I'm really sorry
that I missed the carpet.

35:55.454 --> 35:58.290
I understand your mother
was having a tough time.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.892
Exactly.
And she's more
important to you than me.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.761
Wait. Wait. What?!

36:02.794 --> 36:04.630
Well, you chose her over me.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.199
No, it was just because she
was upset about the breakup.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.901
So was I, and tonight
was a huge night

36:09.935 --> 36:11.770
for me, and you didn't show up.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.973
So the only Tiago related
hashtag trending

36:15.006 --> 36:17.409
was hashtag Rolonelio.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.678
You made a choice.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.348
At least own it.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.984
I'm really sorry, Dad.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.955
I just think
I need some space right now.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.892
Uh...

36:42.768 --> 36:43.735
I just feel so badly.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.371
I know.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.573
I'm sorry
I put you in that position.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.775
I e-mailed him a long apology,
lots of emojis. I won't be long.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.410
Where are you now?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.011
Taking Dad's advice, actually.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.747
I'm owning my choice.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.718
Michael is willing
to give up his job.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.321
Does that make it okay?

37:02.354 --> 37:04.823
I didn't think so,

37:04.856 --> 37:06.692
because it's not about that.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.827
The problem is
I'm choosing him.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.496
And I am

37:10.529 --> 37:11.930
choosing him.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.700
Either accept it, or don't,
but if you don't,

37:14.733 --> 37:17.803
you're the one who is making it
worse on our son,

37:17.836 --> 37:19.538
not me.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.974
I don't want to be replaced.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.945
What?! No, you won't be.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.416
Hey, you won't be.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.850
You're Mateo's dad.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.854
Yeah.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.857
I'll try.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.259
Thank you.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.444
(elevator bell dings)

37:58.477 --> 37:59.845
(elevator door closes)

38:05.551 --> 38:07.052
What are you doing here?
You asked

38:07.085 --> 38:11.056
what to expect from me when the
babies come, so, here it goes.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.358
I will be there...

38:12.391 --> 38:14.059
for all of it.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.494
I'll be the night nurse,

38:15.527 --> 38:16.862
I'll wake up with them
every three hours.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.497
I will feed them,
I will burp them.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.766
What?
It's everything
that I wanted to do

38:20.799 --> 38:22.100
with Mateo and Jane,
but I never got the chance.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.769
I'll even put in a door
between our suites,

38:23.802 --> 38:27.373
so that I can go
back and forth.
Rafael, stop.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.807
What's going on?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.009
I want to be there...

38:31.042 --> 38:33.612
with the babies,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.614
with you.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.884
You are not a second-class
citizen, Petra, and...

38:42.421 --> 38:44.890
Maybe I made a mistake.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.896
What happened?

38:50.929 --> 38:53.098
Excuse me?
I'm guessing

38:53.131 --> 38:57.035
Jane rejected you in some way,
so now you're here?

38:58.704 --> 39:00.906
I'm not
a second-class citizen, Raf.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.910
But I'm not
a second choice, either.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.813
You should go.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.920
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.656
Hey.
Hey.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.392
Are you alone?
Yup.

39:20.426 --> 39:24.830
But I'm not planning
on going home alone.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.933
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And neither, for the record,
 was Jane.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.669
WOMAN:
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.739
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.774
One, two, three,
four, five...

39:35.807 --> 39:37.743
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when she saw him.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.078
WOMAN:
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.681
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

39:42.714 --> 39:45.717
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And he saw her.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.958
(bright Broadway-style
melody playing)

40:22.521 --> 40:24.956
*

40:30.729 --> 40:31.997
WOMAN:
 Guys, we're trying to rehearse.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.432
Can you make out
somewhere else?

40:36.602 --> 40:39.104
(both snickering quietly)

40:39.137 --> 40:42.207
(bright, Broadway-style
melody resumes)

40:42.240 --> 40:44.843
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw. And I hate
 to burst this bubble.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.685
Paola!

40:53.719 --> 40:55.487
Thank God it's you.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.589
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 But that is what I'm here for.

40:57.623 --> 41:00.225
I thought it was a crazy person
sitting there in the dark.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.860
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You thought right!

41:01.893 --> 41:03.662
No problem.
And so you know,

41:03.695 --> 41:06.031
I've taken care of all the
security measures we discussed.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.934
I had new locks installed.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.970
I also had

41:12.003 --> 41:14.105
a new security system put in.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.974
(beeping)

41:16.007 --> 41:17.909
And I installed

41:17.943 --> 41:22.080
bars in all the windows
so no one can ever get out.

41:22.113 --> 41:25.617
You mean,
so no one could ever get in?

41:25.651 --> 41:26.918
No.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.787
That's not

41:28.820 --> 41:31.089
what I mean.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.792
Rogo.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.762
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And it should be noted,
 that's when he realized...

41:36.795 --> 41:39.598
There's only one person in
the world who has ever called me

41:39.631 --> 41:41.967
by that name,
my old prison pen pal Lola.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.702
So you remember me?

41:43.735 --> 41:44.970
But you-you couldn't be.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.939
She was in jail when
you worked for J. Lo.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.875
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And that's when he heard

41:49.908 --> 41:51.843
the scariest words of all.

41:51.877 --> 41:54.680
I've never met J. Lo.
