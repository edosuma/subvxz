01:13.913 --> 01:15.813
Goes
on and on and on.

01:18.184 --> 01:19.717
Can I speak
to Mr. Evans, please?

01:19.719 --> 01:20.887
Officer on deck!

01:25.659 --> 01:27.627
Douglas, Douglas Evans?

01:29.529 --> 01:30.896
What can I do
for you gentlemen?

01:30.898 --> 01:32.530
Giles Templar.

01:32.532 --> 01:33.932
I hope you don't mind,
couple of my colleagues

01:33.934 --> 01:35.533
were talking about this place.

01:35.535 --> 01:37.768
I thought I'd come
and take a look.

01:37.770 --> 01:40.471
I've done a bit of the old
white collar boxing, you know.

01:40.473 --> 01:43.474
No, no, I'm pretty
bloody handy, actually.

01:43.476 --> 01:46.477
Well, if you wanna join,
it's 40 quid a month.

01:46.479 --> 01:47.745
God, no.

01:47.747 --> 01:48.979
No, I work out at
the Third Space.

01:48.981 --> 01:50.851
Zumba, Pilates, hot yoga.

01:51.851 --> 01:52.884
I want to fight.

01:52.886 --> 01:55.019
Doesn't work like that, mate.

01:55.021 --> 01:57.488
You can't just
walk in and fight.

01:57.490 --> 01:58.089
Oh, I think I can.

01:58.091 --> 01:59.857
No, you can't.

01:59.859 --> 02:01.926
There's rules for
your own safety.

02:01.928 --> 02:04.161
Don't worry about
my safety, old boy.

02:04.163 --> 02:06.600
I'm from Bloodstone
Corporate Finance.

02:10.537 --> 02:11.170
Big Hug?

02:12.873 --> 02:15.073
No thanks, YMCA's up the road.

02:15.075 --> 02:18.746
No, Big Hug Payday Loans.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.912
Listen, I don't care

02:20.914 --> 02:22.480
if you're Barney the
fricking dinosaur.

02:22.482 --> 02:23.884
Rules are rules for good reason.

02:25.551 --> 02:30.557
See,
I work for Big Hug, hmm?

02:31.224 --> 02:32.623
We're going to own this place.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.094
You know, collateral.

02:35.496 --> 02:36.129
Loan default.

02:37.296 --> 02:39.230
You're making some assumptions
there, aren't you, cowboy?

02:39.232 --> 02:40.799
Well, I can keep the wolf away

02:40.801 --> 02:42.667
for a little bit,
freeze the interest.

02:42.669 --> 02:44.005
I just wanna have some fun.

02:44.872 --> 02:45.706
Fun?

02:48.908 --> 02:49.910
It's not your plaything.

02:51.010 --> 02:51.910
And you can button your flies.

02:51.912 --> 02:53.713
I can close you in hours.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.282
Get back to it!

02:58.284 --> 02:59.918
That's two minutes.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.686
Oi!

03:01.688 --> 03:03.287
Look, I'm not
some bloody child.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.958
I can bloody scrap, actually.

03:07.660 --> 03:08.960
This ain't that.

03:08.962 --> 03:10.665
Just give me a
little taster now

03:11.831 --> 03:13.632
and I'll buy you
a couple of weeks.

03:13.634 --> 03:14.902
Get your piggy bank in order.

03:15.968 --> 03:16.837
Months, then?

03:18.038 --> 03:19.841
I can do that, it's easy for me.

03:20.841 --> 03:21.676
I can help you.

03:24.044 --> 03:24.879
Or not.

03:26.212 --> 03:28.014
Need a sparring
partner, captain?

03:30.182 --> 03:32.186
I'm not
fighting that thing.

03:35.122 --> 03:36.587
What's your name?

03:36.589 --> 03:38.759
Um, Rupert, Roopie.

03:40.027 --> 03:41.126
- Or Roop.
- You're a witness.

03:41.128 --> 03:43.895
This man waived all his rights.

03:43.897 --> 03:47.164
He walked in here and directly
challenged Albert to a fight.

03:47.166 --> 03:50.003
Albert, glove up!

03:53.240 --> 03:54.509
This is ridiculous.

03:58.979 --> 04:00.779
It's that or nothing, cowboy.

04:00.781 --> 04:02.212
Just don't get clever with him.

04:02.214 --> 04:04.115
- Easy, yeah?
- Go on, Gi.

04:04.117 --> 04:05.984
Show them what you can do.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.593
Keep it tight
now, Albert, son!

04:15.595 --> 04:16.228
Come on!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.234
Go easy on him, just
wanna tire him out a bit.

04:24.236 --> 04:26.073
Oh, yes,
come on, Albert!

04:27.306 --> 04:29.907
Okay, you both know the rules.

04:29.909 --> 04:30.741
Box.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.148
Let's see what he's
got, huh?

04:37.150 --> 04:37.784
Yeah.

04:39.385 --> 04:42.022
That's it, cover up!

04:45.993 --> 04:48.863
He's punching fresh air, Albert!

04:51.130 --> 04:52.330
Left, left!

04:52.332 --> 04:54.702
And then the old Haymaker!

04:58.738 --> 05:00.340
Unleash the Gi bomb!

05:07.347 --> 05:08.813
Come on, Albert!

05:08.815 --> 05:10.414
He's all over the
place, that's it!

05:10.416 --> 05:13.184
You could beat
him one-handed, Albert!

05:13.186 --> 05:15.854
Okay, Albert,
big one now, come on!

05:15.856 --> 05:16.690
Come on!

05:20.126 --> 05:21.359
- Oi!
- Yeah!

05:21.361 --> 05:22.160
He's knocked
out, knocked out!

05:22.162 --> 05:24.128
Yay, go on, Albert!

05:26.166 --> 05:27.335
Hello, sailor!

05:32.873 --> 05:37.777
Now, you can take your Gi
bomb and your Roopie and fuck.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.213
And that wasteman thought
he was bare hype, you know.

05:43.215 --> 05:46.284
Spitting lyrics about Pilates.

05:46.286 --> 05:48.219
What's this Pilates, fam?

05:48.221 --> 05:50.688
Yeah, it's kinda raw, still.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.991
But man like Albert
had him on lockdown, G.

05:52.993 --> 05:54.191
OG status, you done though.

05:54.193 --> 05:55.229
Reach me, cuz.

05:59.799 --> 06:02.066
All right, safe, G, yeah,
I'm a bounce, still.

06:02.068 --> 06:03.068
Hold it, innit.

06:03.070 --> 06:04.736
I'm a check my boys.

06:04.738 --> 06:07.071
Gonna break the internet,
G, know what I'm saying?

06:07.073 --> 06:07.907
Jeez!

06:10.710 --> 06:11.975
Hey, yo Carlos!

06:11.977 --> 06:12.811
Wagwan, G!

06:12.813 --> 06:14.244
What did he just say?

06:14.246 --> 06:15.380
- Hey.
- No idea.

06:15.382 --> 06:16.948
I just left the
gym, yeah, check this, yeah.

06:16.950 --> 06:19.217
Oh, Albert, I,
um, I forgot the,

06:19.219 --> 06:21.385
turn off the thing
in the back, yeah?

06:21.387 --> 06:23.153
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

06:23.155 --> 06:24.989
Yeah, yeah, sure.

06:24.991 --> 06:28.792
Are we, uh, are we in
bother then, captain?

06:28.794 --> 06:30.027
What?

06:30.029 --> 06:31.128
Well, I heard
'em talking about,

06:31.130 --> 06:33.364
you know, loans and stuff.

06:33.366 --> 06:37.001
No, just, um, some
over-privileged prick

06:37.003 --> 06:39.337
thinks having a few quid
makes him a superhero.

06:39.339 --> 06:40.739
That's all.

06:40.741 --> 06:41.972
We showed him though,
didn't we, captain?

06:41.974 --> 06:43.808
You showed him, Albert.

06:43.810 --> 06:44.876
You did.

06:44.878 --> 06:47.145
Taffy would be
proud, you know.

06:48.114 --> 06:51.049
Yeah, that's all we
want, isn't it, eh?

06:51.051 --> 06:51.883
Yeah.

06:51.885 --> 06:53.184
Yeah.

06:53.186 --> 06:54.221
Night, captain.

06:59.859 --> 07:00.760
Be lucky, Albert.

07:22.782 --> 07:24.549
Are you, Taff?

07:24.551 --> 07:26.053
Are you proud?

07:28.554 --> 07:32.056
I'm trying to keep
it going, Taff.

07:32.058 --> 07:33.159
Really, I am.

07:36.195 --> 07:37.363
Could do with a sign here, mate.

07:39.198 --> 07:40.398
Let me know I'm not
pissing in the wind.

07:52.979 --> 07:54.244
You could just use the door.

07:54.246 --> 07:56.013
Old habits.

07:56.015 --> 08:00.854
Smoked salmon and cream
cheese, crayfish and rocket.

08:02.823 --> 08:05.289
Do you know if you don't
wash for six weeks,

08:05.291 --> 08:06.890
then your hair and your skin

08:06.892 --> 08:09.393
develop their own
cleansing system?

08:09.395 --> 08:10.595
Doesn't work, you honk.

08:10.597 --> 08:11.431
New York.

08:16.202 --> 08:17.201
Mm.

08:17.203 --> 08:18.404
Showers haven't moved.

08:20.140 --> 08:21.138
Give it three more days,

08:21.140 --> 08:24.575
and I'll smell like an
alpine flower meadow.

08:24.577 --> 08:27.244
Brian turns the
bout into a real go around,

08:27.246 --> 08:29.246
but he almost got
schooled by the shot.

08:29.248 --> 08:30.381
What gives?

08:30.383 --> 08:32.349
Still the
champion at the final gong.

08:32.351 --> 08:34.251
Miss my daughter.

08:34.254 --> 08:36.053
Where is she?

08:36.054 --> 08:37.157
Somewhere in Europe.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.027
That's a pretty big haystack.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.393
I got more air
miles than Stelios.

08:43.395 --> 08:45.263
Trouble
from the first round on.

08:45.265 --> 08:47.231
Her mum was quite
a looker, you know.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.102
So, what happened?

08:50.270 --> 08:52.870
Found a richer bloke, shagged
her way into First Class,

08:52.872 --> 08:54.538
disappeared back behind
the Iron Curtain.

08:54.540 --> 08:55.373
Four points.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.309
With your daughter?

08:57.943 --> 09:02.348
Whew, still, Taffy left you
a wonderful legacy though.

09:03.582 --> 09:06.316
And the unpaid gambling
debt that went with it.

09:06.318 --> 09:09.387
Yeah, still, that's all
been paid off now, eh?

09:09.389 --> 09:10.955
Brian
O'Shea, a right cross.

09:10.957 --> 09:11.889
- Oh.
- Tangles with

09:11.891 --> 09:13.123
defending champ.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.292
Things
could be worse.

09:15.294 --> 09:19.567
I've got this terrible rash
on me arse and me teeth hurt!

09:22.001 --> 09:23.100
Shower!

09:23.102 --> 09:27.241
Blocked only
twice, they might rally.

09:36.616 --> 09:37.617
Chin down.

09:44.356 --> 09:46.291
Move those feet, fucker.

09:46.293 --> 09:47.658
Hey, it's bait, it's bait!

09:47.660 --> 09:50.961
Albert gave him
that night nurse, G!

09:50.963 --> 09:51.595
- Come on, Albert!
- What are you two

09:51.597 --> 09:52.997
laughing about?

09:52.999 --> 09:54.599
Hey, I'm just
showing Mick, innit.

09:54.601 --> 09:56.135
Our OG went ham!

09:57.971 --> 10:00.138
Don't be showing anybody that!

10:00.140 --> 10:01.505
You're gonna get
me in more bother!

10:01.507 --> 10:04.175
I'm sick of telling him!

10:04.177 --> 10:05.310
All right, leave it, G.

10:05.312 --> 10:07.478
Mick ain't gonna trip and
turn snitch like a bitch.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.412
Hey, I checked on Albert, innit.

10:08.414 --> 10:11.418
Upper cut, head top clip, pow!

10:36.175 --> 10:37.608
What's your name, son?

10:37.610 --> 10:38.412
Donny.

10:39.511 --> 10:41.412
You looking to train, Donny?

10:41.414 --> 10:44.748
Been playing on
the computer, iPad?

10:44.750 --> 10:46.452
Can't
afford one of those.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.489
So, why do you
wanna box, Donny?

10:51.491 --> 10:54.492
Um, well, some
of my uncles do it.

10:54.494 --> 10:58.562
And, uh, I wanna honor
the family, you know.

10:58.564 --> 10:59.465
Mm, yeah.

11:03.135 --> 11:04.634
You know it's hard,
don't you, Donny?

11:04.636 --> 11:06.470
It's not like telly.

11:06.472 --> 11:08.409
And the Xbox doesn't
punch you in the gob.

11:10.543 --> 11:12.143
There's no tougher sport.

11:12.145 --> 11:13.610
Ballet.

11:13.612 --> 11:14.445
What?

11:14.447 --> 11:15.479
What?

11:15.481 --> 11:16.549
Ballet's a bitch.

11:22.422 --> 11:23.457
Can you skip?

11:26.025 --> 11:29.494
Your world is now divided
into three-minute chunks.

11:29.496 --> 11:31.398
Everything you do
takes three minutes.

11:32.564 --> 11:34.132
Eat, read, work.

11:34.134 --> 11:35.399
Sleep?

11:35.401 --> 11:36.433
Not sleep.

11:36.435 --> 11:37.634
Blink?

11:37.636 --> 11:39.170
No, that would,

11:39.172 --> 11:40.671
look, you need to
get used to working

11:40.673 --> 11:41.672
in three-minute bursts.

11:41.674 --> 11:42.543
Like washing up.

11:43.809 --> 11:45.442
We've done that now.

11:45.444 --> 11:46.577
Oh.

11:46.579 --> 11:48.446
Look, you train and fight
in three-minute bursts,

11:48.448 --> 11:49.680
so just get used
to understanding

11:49.682 --> 11:51.114
what three minutes feels like.

11:51.116 --> 11:52.652
Uh, you boil an
egg in three minutes.

11:55.587 --> 11:56.390
Skip.

11:57.524 --> 12:00.224
Yeah.

12:14.406 --> 12:18.244
Just so you know, mate,
that's not skipping.

12:26.285 --> 12:27.685
It wasn't like that.

12:27.687 --> 12:29.619
Someone's messed
with the footage.

12:29.621 --> 12:30.787
Come on, Albert!

12:30.789 --> 12:32.090
He's all over the place!

12:32.092 --> 12:33.758
- That's it!
- Go on, Gi.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.158
I believe in you!

12:35.160 --> 12:37.228
All right
him one-handed, Albert!

12:37.230 --> 12:39.297
Okay, Albert,
big one now, come on!

12:39.299 --> 12:40.364
Come on!

12:40.366 --> 12:41.731
Keep swinging!

12:48.408 --> 12:49.239
Where have you been?

12:49.241 --> 12:51.374
Unleashing a Gi bomb?

12:54.246 --> 12:55.613
Sorry.

12:55.615 --> 12:58.148
Someone's put the
fight on YouTube.

13:04.323 --> 13:05.625
Get me the file.

13:07.393 --> 13:08.662
Yeah.

13:09.728 --> 13:10.595
Good grip.

13:10.597 --> 13:12.629
That'll do, off you go.

13:12.631 --> 13:13.633
Officer on deck!

13:15.668 --> 13:17.502
Still here then?

13:17.504 --> 13:18.335
Uh, yeah.

13:18.337 --> 13:19.503
He's a trier, captain.

13:19.505 --> 13:21.906
Hasn't let go of the rope
since you were called away.

13:21.908 --> 13:23.373
- Mm.
- I think we might

13:23.375 --> 13:25.446
have a champion in
the club at last.

13:27.746 --> 13:29.814
Show us your progress then.

13:29.816 --> 13:30.651
Okay.

13:31.885 --> 13:32.782
Remember what I said.

13:32.784 --> 13:34.317
Yeah.

13:34.319 --> 13:35.421
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

13:40.626 --> 13:42.759
I'm sorry, son.

13:42.761 --> 13:45.698
Don't worry, son,
it's only practice.

13:46.632 --> 13:48.201
It's only practice.

13:50.669 --> 13:51.505
Champion?

13:52.672 --> 13:54.808
Would I be able to take
the rope home and practice?

13:56.375 --> 13:57.774
That's a leather rope.

13:57.776 --> 13:59.710
It's been in this gym
since Noah was a lad.

13:59.712 --> 14:02.913
Have you any idea the blood
and sweat that's seen?

14:02.915 --> 14:04.681
The honor it deserves?

14:04.683 --> 14:06.816
Champions have made
weight on that rope.

14:06.818 --> 14:08.853
It's part of the
very DNA of this gym.

14:08.855 --> 14:12.255
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

14:12.257 --> 14:13.224
Sorry.

15:01.674 --> 15:04.944
That kid, you made his week.

15:06.312 --> 15:08.245
You are a captain.

15:08.247 --> 15:11.417
You're a captain to
me, the other lads.

15:13.452 --> 15:14.288
That's all.

15:16.389 --> 15:17.224
Thanks, Albert.

15:18.957 --> 15:20.657
You silly old bugger.

15:29.534 --> 15:31.771
Well, I'm going
the other way, so.

15:33.372 --> 15:34.241
Night, captain.

15:35.308 --> 15:35.976
Be lucky, mate.

16:20.819 --> 16:21.686
Too old for this.

16:27.726 --> 16:29.726
Christ on a bike.

16:29.728 --> 16:31.329
For a homeless dude,
you've got more blubber

16:31.331 --> 16:33.400
than a blooming humpback.

16:45.812 --> 16:48.412
The milk of human kindness.

16:48.414 --> 16:50.648
Asparagus and cream cheese.

16:50.650 --> 16:52.917
Absolutely delicious.

16:52.919 --> 16:56.921
But beware, the breakdown
of sulfuric compounds

16:56.923 --> 17:01.895
can cause a profusion of
varied, pungent malodor!

17:03.629 --> 17:04.897
Smelly weewee.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.839
Happy birthday, friend.

17:15.842 --> 17:16.909
Ta-da!

17:42.567 --> 17:45.838
Oh, boy, Christ, that's rank.

17:47.172 --> 17:48.607
There's bogs in the back.

18:13.565 --> 18:17.868
Dirty, no-good,
double die piss balling,

18:17.870 --> 18:21.073
arse wiping liberty
taking clowns!

18:22.542 --> 18:23.640
No, Dad!

18:23.642 --> 18:24.574
I need that!

18:24.576 --> 18:26.644
And I need a new pair of legs.

18:26.646 --> 18:27.844
We're both knackered.

18:27.846 --> 18:29.112
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!
- I got a few

18:29.114 --> 18:30.880
- pennies left, Dougie.
- Ah, ah, ah, ooh!

18:30.882 --> 18:32.116
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

18:32.118 --> 18:34.185
How much do you need?

18:34.187 --> 18:37.721
Don't tell these, otherwise
they're gonna nick it.

18:37.723 --> 18:40.627
Dad, you've already
given me your pension.

18:41.828 --> 18:43.864
I can't do anything,
it just has to go down.

18:45.598 --> 18:49.099
Oh, damn this pansy-arsed,

18:49.101 --> 18:52.839
new age, muesli, yoga bullshit!

18:54.873 --> 18:56.142
Take me home, Dougie.

18:57.576 --> 18:59.877
Please, take me home.

19:02.047 --> 19:03.849
There is no home, Dad.

19:04.784 --> 19:05.851
It's just me and the gym.

19:07.586 --> 19:09.653
The gym's run out of steam.

19:09.655 --> 19:10.920
There's no money.

19:10.922 --> 19:13.624
I took out loans to
pay for this place.

19:13.626 --> 19:17.731
Put the gym up as collateral
and now I can't pay it back.

19:33.278 --> 19:34.647
Silly old sod.

19:40.852 --> 19:42.887
Come on, no pain, no gain.

19:42.889 --> 19:44.053
That's it, come on!

19:44.055 --> 19:45.622
One, two.

19:45.624 --> 19:46.890
Put some effort in!

19:46.892 --> 19:48.027
Hey, hey, hey!

19:48.995 --> 19:50.828
What have I told ya?

19:55.700 --> 19:56.635
Pack it in!

20:19.124 --> 20:20.659
Captain on deck.

20:26.131 --> 20:27.130
Yo, yo, bruv.

20:27.132 --> 20:30.099
Who's that piff ting, G?

20:30.101 --> 20:31.071
Join in, blud.

20:32.103 --> 20:34.638
Yeah, is Doug here?

20:34.640 --> 20:37.243
Um, we came to talk about
the forms and stuff.

20:38.274 --> 20:39.776
He's behind you.

20:50.121 --> 20:52.055
Oh, um, Mum, this is Doug.

20:52.057 --> 20:53.090
He's the boss.

20:53.092 --> 20:55.759
Hi Doug, I'm
Vera, Donny's mum.

20:55.761 --> 20:57.964
I've come to sign some forms.

20:59.031 --> 21:00.000
Dad?

21:01.066 --> 21:02.101
Sorry?

21:02.968 --> 21:04.635
It's usually dad.

21:04.637 --> 21:05.636
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.

21:05.638 --> 21:07.874
Uh, I haven't seen a woman.

21:09.809 --> 21:11.678
I mean I haven't, you know,

21:13.111 --> 21:14.147
not, you know.

21:15.281 --> 21:16.917
Women don't normally like it.

21:18.016 --> 21:18.985
Mums, that is.

21:20.719 --> 21:22.086
Are you okay?

21:22.088 --> 21:24.621
Yeah, I was just in the.

21:24.623 --> 21:26.290
Is that where the forms are?

21:26.292 --> 21:27.226
No, no, no.

21:29.996 --> 21:31.130
Shit!

21:32.698 --> 21:35.099
Sorry, the language.

21:35.101 --> 21:37.234
Oh, God, what is that?

21:37.236 --> 21:42.171
That's, uh,
leather conditioner.

21:42.173 --> 21:46.076
Yeah, yeah, uh, we use it on
the bags and all the gloves.

21:46.078 --> 21:48.012
Smells
like rotten eggs.

21:48.014 --> 21:50.680
Yeah, well, that's
the chemicals.

21:50.682 --> 21:52.015
- Right.
- God.

21:52.017 --> 21:54.051
It does smell like rotten eggs.

21:54.053 --> 21:55.021
Rotten eggs and

21:57.989 --> 21:58.791
piss.

22:00.191 --> 22:01.361
Well, don't wanna waste it.

22:02.661 --> 22:03.726
No, no, no, no.

22:03.728 --> 22:05.064
We've already done everything.

22:06.131 --> 22:07.798
Oh.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.032
Yeah, yeah.

22:09.034 --> 22:10.667
That's why it was there.

22:10.669 --> 22:12.304
I want my hands
tough like leather.

22:16.676 --> 22:17.310
Fight the burn!

22:18.977 --> 22:20.080
Do us a favor, Mick.

22:30.890 --> 22:31.992
Right, forms.

22:34.192 --> 22:35.792
Double jab.

22:35.794 --> 22:36.894
Right cross.

22:36.896 --> 22:37.731
Double jab.

22:38.397 --> 22:39.830
That's it.

22:39.832 --> 22:40.930
- Time.
- Dads usually do this,

22:40.932 --> 22:42.166
is what I meant.

22:42.168 --> 22:45.002
You know, mums are
a bit squeamish.

22:45.004 --> 22:47.236
Not me, I've been around
fighting all me life.

22:47.238 --> 22:48.408
Oh, sorry.

22:49.742 --> 22:50.644
It's a tradition.

22:51.409 --> 22:52.011
Oh.

22:54.179 --> 22:57.013
Does, uh, Donny's dad fight?

22:57.015 --> 22:59.716
Haven't got a clue, I
ain't seen him for years.

22:59.718 --> 23:00.519
Oh, sorry.

23:03.288 --> 23:06.291
No, I'm glad,
he's a right wanker.

23:07.993 --> 23:08.828
How much is it?

23:09.961 --> 23:11.230
It's, uh, 20 quid a,

23:14.365 --> 23:16.268
no, I'm not gonna
take your money.

23:17.736 --> 23:19.171
Why, what do you mean?

23:20.438 --> 23:22.108
I don't think I'm gonna
be around for much longer.

23:23.242 --> 23:25.011
You know there are
people you can talk to?

23:26.211 --> 23:27.477
What?

23:27.479 --> 23:30.246
Well, Samaritans and
drugs, they can help.

23:30.248 --> 23:31.447
I'm not gonna top meself.

23:31.449 --> 23:34.153
Just don't use a gun, it's
not as neat as people think.

23:35.187 --> 23:36.255
It's not like that.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.290
Look.

23:40.292 --> 23:41.126
Donny's a good kid.

23:43.062 --> 23:46.530
I'll get him started,
help set him up,

23:46.532 --> 23:47.965
so he can find another gym.

23:47.967 --> 23:50.333
They, they won't be as
friendly as this place,

23:50.335 --> 23:53.771
but I'll get him ready.

23:53.773 --> 23:55.805
It's such a shame though.

23:55.807 --> 23:57.142
Donny loved it yesterday.

23:58.244 --> 24:00.077
Albert teaching him to skip.

24:00.079 --> 24:01.948
He's awkward, shy.

24:03.114 --> 24:04.750
I was just hoping
this would help.

24:08.821 --> 24:10.189
He said his uncles fight.

24:11.422 --> 24:13.456
I'm gonna go then.

24:13.458 --> 24:14.294
Oh, uh,

24:16.996 --> 24:17.831
will you be back?

24:19.998 --> 24:20.833
What for?

24:22.066 --> 24:23.233
And thanks.

24:23.235 --> 24:25.472
It's a shame, but I'm just
gonna have to find another gym.

24:29.909 --> 24:31.210
Maybe you won't have to.

24:33.111 --> 24:34.278
Be lucky, then.

24:50.528 --> 24:53.030
47 grand in seven days.

24:53.032 --> 24:54.564
Are you sure?

24:54.566 --> 24:57.134
It's not addressed to
someone else, a relative or...

24:57.136 --> 24:59.235
It's addressed to us
but with his name on.

24:59.237 --> 25:00.870
47 stacks, fam.

25:00.872 --> 25:04.006
Ain't no man gonna raise
gwala like that, you get me?

25:04.008 --> 25:06.609
I was in the shower all
afternoon, I'm spotless.

25:06.611 --> 25:08.145
Oi, check this though, yeah.

25:08.147 --> 25:09.013
I'll get my posse
involved, innit.

25:09.015 --> 25:12.381
Huh, Riz, behave
your bloody self.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.217
We know there's no posse.

25:14.219 --> 25:15.418
Bumbaclart!

25:15.420 --> 25:17.221
Look, there's no smell.

25:17.223 --> 25:18.388
Can't I just come in?

25:18.390 --> 25:19.388
Sponsorship?

25:20.592 --> 25:22.059
Nobody's interested
in boxing anymore.

25:22.061 --> 25:23.193
They'd all rather play it

25:23.195 --> 25:24.227
on their game console,
wouldn't they?

25:24.229 --> 25:26.196
And that's where the
sponsorship is, isn't it?

25:26.198 --> 25:30.500
I've got the, uh, WBO world
champ '16 in the house.

25:30.502 --> 25:32.101
What, not for me, for the kids!

25:32.103 --> 25:33.907
They're too young for our game!

25:35.373 --> 25:38.175
God.

25:38.177 --> 25:40.409
I don't know what I'd
do without the gym.

25:40.411 --> 25:41.878
It's everything.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.046
It's everything to
all of us, isn't it?

25:44.048 --> 25:47.184
I couldn't be alone with
Marjorie in the house for a week.

25:47.186 --> 25:48.385
Be the death of me.

25:48.387 --> 25:52.325
Look, I used Dettol and a
scrubbing brush, for God's sake!

25:54.560 --> 25:55.395
Brilliant.

25:56.461 --> 25:58.427
♪ Once I leave the house ♪

25:59.531 --> 26:00.332
Night.

26:14.513 --> 26:16.513
Is Doug a good fighter?

26:18.350 --> 26:19.284
The best.

26:20.351 --> 26:23.419
Awesome, and I mean awesome.

26:23.421 --> 26:25.024
Doesn't fight now though.

26:26.158 --> 26:26.993
After Taffy.

26:28.294 --> 26:29.361
Why, what happened?

26:31.362 --> 26:32.663
I'm coming in.

26:37.402 --> 26:40.405
So, Doug's the most promising
pro middleweight in London.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.571
Taffy used to own the gym.

26:42.573 --> 26:44.241
A legend.

26:44.243 --> 26:45.211
He trained Doug.

26:46.411 --> 26:51.183
Doug's warm up fight, before
he goes for European title,

26:52.351 --> 26:53.419
Taffy has a heart
attack ringside.

26:55.254 --> 26:56.285
Dead.

26:56.287 --> 26:57.122
No.

26:58.023 --> 26:58.655
Beat.

26:58.657 --> 27:00.090
Yeah, when Taffy died,

27:00.092 --> 27:01.457
he left Dougie the gym
in his will, didn't he.

27:01.459 --> 27:02.725
Yeah.

27:02.727 --> 27:05.061
So overnight, he went from a
boxing hero to a businessman,

27:05.063 --> 27:09.465
and well, could have been a
champ though, couldn't he, eh?

27:09.467 --> 27:10.466
Could have been a great champ.

27:10.468 --> 27:12.468
He's a proud man.

27:12.470 --> 27:14.506
And do you think
he'd ever fight again?

27:24.216 --> 27:26.382
You have never experienced

27:26.384 --> 27:29.986
the liberation of
unbridled micturition.

27:31.457 --> 27:32.688
The what?

27:32.690 --> 27:34.590
It's like being
at one with nature.

27:34.592 --> 27:38.195
It's an expression of
masculinity, of territory.

27:38.197 --> 27:41.098
You're saying, I reject
your civilization.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.766
I reject your sanitation.

27:43.768 --> 27:45.334
I choose.

27:45.336 --> 27:46.436
You pissed in a slop bucket

27:46.438 --> 27:49.339
because you couldn't be
arsed to walk to the bog.

27:49.341 --> 27:50.474
You're a sloth.

27:50.476 --> 27:52.512
I am marking
territory, old socks.

27:56.582 --> 27:58.415
Doesn't matter anyway.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.016
Women like that
can pick and choose

28:00.018 --> 28:02.351
and a used up fighter
with massive debt

28:02.353 --> 28:04.053
wouldn't even make the not
in a thousand years list.

28:04.055 --> 28:07.357
Oh, come on now, you
know how to treat a woman.

28:07.359 --> 28:08.291
I thought so.

28:08.293 --> 28:09.359
I did all right in my day.

28:09.361 --> 28:12.728
Oh, you're still the
same guy you always were.

28:12.730 --> 28:16.465
Sure, there's a bit more fat.

28:16.467 --> 28:18.568
Okay, the virility is declined.

28:18.570 --> 28:21.471
You, you, you, you
craved her every day,

28:21.473 --> 28:23.240
sometimes every hour.

28:23.242 --> 28:25.609
But now, once a week
seems like an effort,

28:25.611 --> 28:27.543
and the face has sagged

28:27.545 --> 28:30.813
and the onset of bitch
tits seems inevitable,

28:30.815 --> 28:33.315
but all you've got to
look forward to is a...

28:33.317 --> 28:35.351
You don't bloody wash

28:35.353 --> 28:37.219
and you piss wherever
the urge takes you.

28:37.221 --> 28:38.655
You're like a stray dog.

28:38.657 --> 28:41.461
I am a wolf.

28:42.561 --> 28:43.693
End of the 13th.

28:45.496 --> 28:47.363
Well, I'm buggered.

28:54.439 --> 28:56.606
After too many
years of celibacy,

28:56.608 --> 28:59.609
savage ex-wife that swore
me off women for life,

28:59.611 --> 29:01.311
I've finally found
the woman of my dreams

29:01.313 --> 29:02.547
who thinks I'm a basket case.

29:07.753 --> 29:08.755
That looks good.

29:10.421 --> 29:12.621
I was saving this
for a celebration.

29:12.623 --> 29:13.490
Down
with Polk all over him.

29:13.492 --> 29:15.091
Maybe when I saw
my daughter again,

29:15.093 --> 29:20.099
but that's not bloody
likely.

29:21.566 --> 29:25.435
Cook might win
this fight by a wide margin.

29:25.437 --> 29:27.372
He's trying to hold on.

29:33.478 --> 29:34.644
Last few seconds
of the final round,

29:34.646 --> 29:35.712
sees Vasilio hanging on.

29:35.714 --> 29:37.347
Don't you have a cup?

29:37.349 --> 29:39.215
Then
it was all around.

29:53.765 --> 29:55.465
And where the
hell do you think you've been?

29:55.467 --> 29:57.734
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

29:57.736 --> 29:59.671
Your dinner's ruined.

31:12.210 --> 31:13.776
Algernon Steadman.

31:13.778 --> 31:16.646
Steadman and Cross, chartered
accountants to the stars.

31:16.648 --> 31:20.250
You may have read about me
in such august publications

31:20.252 --> 31:23.619
as Accountancy Age, ACC Global,

31:23.621 --> 31:26.391
and the bankruptcy list in
the Ham and High!

31:30.294 --> 31:32.896
What the hell happened?

31:32.898 --> 31:34.430
That.

31:34.432 --> 31:36.299
The sauce got me.

31:36.301 --> 31:38.767

We're just measuring
up, Mr. Evans.

33:54.939 --> 33:55.804
What?

33:55.806 --> 33:58.810
Oh, I bought the debt.

34:11.822 --> 34:12.920
Juice bar.

34:12.922 --> 34:13.757
Zumba.

34:14.925 --> 34:16.792
I'm a partner, aren't I, Gi?

34:16.793 --> 34:18.764
It's gonna be amazing.

34:20.063 --> 34:20.900
Incredible.

34:23.068 --> 34:23.967
I warned you.

34:26.405 --> 34:27.406
You had your chance.

34:37.849 --> 34:39.947
Roopie, on me.

34:39.949 --> 34:40.820
Oh, coming, Gi.

35:01.006 --> 35:02.007
Oh, bitch.

35:04.175 --> 35:07.545
Oh, Albert, I'm bloody dying.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.912
I might need a hand.

35:13.151 --> 35:14.818
Why aren't you at school?

35:14.820 --> 35:17.120
You look like shit,
but I've got an idea.

35:17.122 --> 35:17.957
What?

35:20.525 --> 35:21.990
This.

35:21.992 --> 35:22.858
They're outlaws.

35:22.860 --> 35:24.093
That's not boxing.

35:24.095 --> 35:26.562
Yeah, I know but the
skills are the same.

35:26.564 --> 35:29.999
Look, the purse is
nearly 100,000 pounds.

35:30.001 --> 35:30.934
Biggest it's ever been.

35:30.936 --> 35:32.635
And then there's the
side bets, you know,

35:32.637 --> 35:34.870
chase the ace, dipping, hustle.

35:34.872 --> 35:37.140
They're tricky buggers,
them Gypsies, let me tell ya.

35:37.142 --> 35:39.608
What, worse than
a payday lender?

35:39.610 --> 35:40.843
- Ooh.
- Look,

35:40.845 --> 35:42.845
there hasn't been a
fight in three years.

35:42.847 --> 35:44.948
No one wants to fight Big Bill
Brady 'cause he's so good.

35:44.950 --> 35:46.783
That's why the purse is so big.

35:46.785 --> 35:48.984
It's irrelevant,
I'm a middleweight.

35:48.986 --> 35:50.919
I've never done bare knuckle.

35:50.921 --> 35:53.890
Added to which, I'm too
old and out of shape.

35:53.892 --> 35:56.792
I couldn't beat him in two
years, let alone two days.

35:56.794 --> 35:58.695
Yeah, but you're not
gonna do the fighting.

35:58.697 --> 36:00.497
You just train the fighter.

36:00.499 --> 36:02.030
Who, Mick?

36:02.968 --> 36:03.966
He's the only one big enough.

36:03.968 --> 36:06.035
And he couldn't knock
the sugar off a donut.

36:07.271 --> 36:08.104
No offense, Mick.

36:08.106 --> 36:09.939
No offense taken.

36:09.941 --> 36:11.140
I don't mind eating the donuts,

36:11.142 --> 36:12.975
I don't wanna knock
shit out of it.

36:14.845 --> 36:16.044
All right, come on, seriously.

36:16.046 --> 36:18.016
Donny, man, who's
gonna fight him?

36:19.818 --> 36:20.653
Well.

36:21.586 --> 36:22.952
My brother.

36:25.122 --> 36:26.891
Donny and I are Romany Gypsies.

36:28.026 --> 36:29.758
There's nothing we'd like more

36:29.760 --> 36:31.961
than to see the title back
in the hands of the Roma.

36:31.963 --> 36:32.898
There's a long history.

36:34.099 --> 36:36.468
My brother was the
last man to fight him.

36:43.642 --> 36:48.647
What, do you all feel the
need to check your wallets?

36:49.780 --> 36:51.680
Irish and Roma travelers
have a huge rivalry.

36:51.682 --> 36:54.017
They've ruined our
already awful reputation.

36:54.019 --> 36:56.019
All that my Big
Fat Gypsy crap.

36:56.021 --> 36:58.023
Donny and I have
to hide our heritage.

36:58.956 --> 37:00.925
You know, it's
compulsory to hate us.

37:03.695 --> 37:05.497
Maybe we can find
a common interest.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.668
What's the common interest?

37:12.102 --> 37:13.505
Donny says you need money.

37:14.872 --> 37:16.338
Don't we all?

37:16.340 --> 37:18.776
47 grand or you're
gonna lose this place.

37:24.115 --> 37:24.950
Is that right?

37:30.255 --> 37:32.590
We've got a surprise
for you, Uncle Nosh.

37:33.791 --> 37:35.927
We're taking you to
Appleby Horse Fair!

37:37.095 --> 37:37.926
No way!

37:37.928 --> 37:38.861
Yeah!

37:38.863 --> 37:40.296
There's just one thing though.

37:40.298 --> 37:41.133
What?

37:43.068 --> 37:44.800
You'll have to
fight Big Bill Brady.

37:44.802 --> 37:46.602
He says you can't go.

37:46.604 --> 37:47.769
No!

37:47.771 --> 37:48.905
He hurts!

37:48.907 --> 37:50.273
Oh, come on, Nosh.

37:50.275 --> 37:52.108
You can do it.

37:52.110 --> 37:54.313
You nearly beat him
last time, remember?

37:55.947 --> 37:59.381
Oh, come on, Nosh, we just
need you to do this for us.

37:59.383 --> 38:01.917
We need the money to
buy some Jaffa Cakes.

38:01.919 --> 38:04.854
Being a nurse, well, it
doesn't pay very well.

38:04.856 --> 38:06.325
You're an extra mouth to feed.

38:09.260 --> 38:10.863
A bloody big mouth.

38:18.168 --> 38:20.071
We have to go in
a bow top wagon.

38:22.407 --> 38:26.142
Uh, yeah, yeah,
of course we will.

38:26.144 --> 38:27.977
All the way.

38:27.979 --> 38:29.081
And I get to drive it.

38:30.814 --> 38:33.916
Go on, go and
choose your outfit.

38:38.657 --> 38:40.189
How the hell we
gonna sort that out?

38:40.191 --> 38:41.124
A bow top?

38:41.126 --> 38:42.227
What, all the way up there?

38:47.965 --> 38:50.969
So, if you can
just sign this one.

38:53.003 --> 38:54.903
And, and there.

38:54.905 --> 38:56.074
And that's it.

38:57.909 --> 39:00.278
Are you sure this
is right, Dougie?

39:02.680 --> 39:04.780
I don't know
what's right, Dad,

39:04.782 --> 39:06.050
but I got to trust someone.

39:07.117 --> 39:10.153
My mate says, transfer
the ownership,

39:10.155 --> 39:12.354
see the insolvency guys to
get the sharks off my back

39:12.356 --> 39:13.625
and buy us some time.

39:14.825 --> 39:16.858
And then find the money.

39:16.860 --> 39:18.727
He says it's gotta happen now.

39:18.729 --> 39:22.097
It's this or wither away.

39:22.099 --> 39:26.202
You raised a fighter,
so I'm gonna fight.

39:26.204 --> 39:28.104
You always was a
smart cookie, Dougie.

39:28.106 --> 39:29.372
You're like your mother.

39:29.374 --> 39:32.175
I say, he's like you, babes.

39:32.177 --> 39:33.742
He's got those Jew smarts.

39:33.744 --> 39:35.747
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dad.

39:36.881 --> 39:39.247
You can't say that
out loud, not in here.

39:39.249 --> 39:41.186
Oh, I do miss your mother.

39:42.887 --> 39:43.889
Yeah, me too, Dad.

39:47.057 --> 39:50.158
Dad, I'm gonna go away
for a little while.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.327
I'm gonna go and try
and get some money.

39:52.329 --> 39:57.335
And when I get back, I hope
that things'll be better.

39:58.269 --> 39:58.971
You go for it, Dougie.

40:00.271 --> 40:01.470
Yeah, and I need you to know

40:01.472 --> 40:03.171
that I'm not gonna come and
see you for a little while,

40:03.173 --> 40:04.807
but it's only 'cause

40:04.809 --> 40:07.209
I'm doing something
really important, okay?

40:07.211 --> 40:08.878
Got it, Dougie.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.215
But little Melissa will
come and see me, won't she?

40:14.184 --> 40:18.289
Dad, she , I
haven't seen her in years.

40:20.057 --> 40:22.024
Her mum took off
with her, remember?

40:22.026 --> 40:24.126
Damn this shitty life!

40:24.128 --> 40:25.160
Hey.

40:25.162 --> 40:26.762
My days are empty.

40:26.764 --> 40:28.296
My nights are emptier.

40:28.298 --> 40:30.001
I need a challenge.

40:33.271 --> 40:36.905
Hey, when I get back,
how about you come

40:36.907 --> 40:38.309
and help me in the gym again?

40:39.209 --> 40:40.309
Like the good old days.

40:40.311 --> 40:41.878
Oh, you don't mean that.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.211
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.546
And we'll get you out
of that home as well.

40:44.548 --> 40:46.048
Don't promise me, Dougie.

40:46.050 --> 40:48.486
Don't promise me and
then break my heart.

40:52.890 --> 40:54.323
♪ Starting to worry 'bout you ♪

40:54.325 --> 40:55.961
Here she is, look.

I'm so delighted to

41:00.564 --> 41:03.298
Now, you call
me Burt, princess.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.934
Have you come to take my bloods?

41:04.936 --> 41:06.301
No, no, I'm Doug's friend.

41:06.303 --> 41:07.503
I've come to witness
the signing of...

41:07.505 --> 41:09.472
Ah, you're the Gypsy girl!

41:09.474 --> 41:10.872
The Gypsy!

41:10.874 --> 41:11.974
Please don't
say that out loud

41:11.976 --> 41:13.209
'cause people hate us.

41:13.211 --> 41:14.144
Who does?

41:14.146 --> 41:16.180
Who could hate you
with a face like that?

41:17.247 --> 41:19.282
Here, what about us here, eh?

41:19.284 --> 41:22.952
I'm a cockney, this here's
a Gypsy, Gypsy girl.

41:22.954 --> 41:25.320
Dougie there, he's a Jew.

41:25.322 --> 41:28.191
'Cause his mother's Jewish,
you see, that's how it works.

41:29.394 --> 41:30.325
Well, I don't care
where people come from,

41:30.327 --> 41:32.327
it's how you live that matters.

41:32.329 --> 41:35.330
Here, put a ring
on this one, Dougie.

41:35.332 --> 41:37.300
She's too good for
this bleedin' place.

41:37.302 --> 41:38.970
It's not like that, Dad.

41:40.238 --> 41:41.340
You best fuck off, mate.

41:45.376 --> 41:46.979
A fine morrow to you, sir.

41:48.378 --> 41:49.245
That Swiss finishing school

41:49.247 --> 41:51.113
worked out well
for you, didn't it?

41:51.115 --> 41:54.383
There's no Jews,
stinking Gypos.

41:54.385 --> 41:56.218
And you can take that fucking
cripple with you and all.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.352
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

41:57.354 --> 41:58.521
Hold tight.

41:58.523 --> 41:59.856
Sit down, sit down.

41:59.858 --> 42:00.926
Dad, sit down.

42:05.162 --> 42:06.995
My old man drank in this
boozer for 50 years.

42:06.997 --> 42:08.497
Don't worry
about this, Dougie.

42:08.499 --> 42:10.002
Dad, I said, no.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.414
One, two, three, four.

42:25.416 --> 42:29.352
That's the order
I'll fight you in.

42:29.354 --> 42:30.322
I'm too tired.

42:31.622 --> 42:32.523
Do you twice.

42:33.390 --> 42:34.356
Oh, yeah?

42:42.532 --> 42:43.999
No, you'll get hurt!

42:44.001 --> 42:44.836
No!

42:47.037 --> 42:47.937
Look at him go!

42:47.939 --> 42:49.305
Go on, my son!

42:49.307 --> 42:50.843
I got a pony on ya!

42:59.050 --> 43:00.916
Told you twice.

43:01.552 --> 43:02.385
Still got it, eh?

43:05.622 --> 43:07.088
Oh, shit!

43:14.965 --> 43:19.401
If all else fails, go
for the knacker cracker.

43:19.403 --> 43:20.303
Go on, girl!

43:20.305 --> 43:23.942
Give him another fucking
wallop!

43:26.276 --> 43:27.709
Tap it.

43:27.711 --> 43:28.914
Jab him now.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.115
Jab, jab.

43:33.351 --> 43:34.186
Nice.

43:38.222 --> 43:39.224
Concentrate.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.600
Where's Tweedledum
and Tweedledumber.

43:52.602 --> 43:54.403
Russel, Russel McKenzie.

43:54.405 --> 43:56.173
I'm an insolvency practitioner.

44:01.512 --> 44:02.477
Algy?

44:02.479 --> 44:05.414
Russel's an old chum!

44:05.416 --> 44:06.983
Just wanted to press
the flesh, you know.

44:06.985 --> 44:08.651
It's all a bit urgent.

44:08.653 --> 44:10.051
Thanks.

44:10.053 --> 44:11.490
Did you transfer
the ownership?

44:13.291 --> 44:14.289
Good.

44:14.291 --> 44:15.758
I'll contact Big Hug.

44:15.760 --> 44:18.260
You need to get the
money together ASAP,

44:18.262 --> 44:21.396
but I can keep them away
for a while, maybe a month,

44:21.398 --> 44:23.032
and freeze the interest.

44:23.034 --> 44:24.166
Best of luck.

44:26.671 --> 44:27.535
Thanks, Algy.

44:28.372 --> 44:29.407
Thanks.

44:31.476 --> 44:34.613
Now, go out and get that
money any way that you can!

44:42.653 --> 44:43.488
28.

44:46.323 --> 44:47.159
29.

44:50.461 --> 44:51.593
30.

44:57.367 --> 44:59.537
Hold that tight now, boys.

45:14.352 --> 45:15.818
Get up, I hardly hit it.

45:15.820 --> 45:18.586
Get him up, I hardly hit that.

45:18.588 --> 45:20.356
Get him up, too.

45:20.358 --> 45:22.758
He's making the
place look untidy.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.126
Mm.

45:24.128 --> 45:25.294
Aw, jeez, Bill.

45:25.296 --> 45:26.162
I'm feeling
strong, boys.

45:26.164 --> 45:27.396
Um, so.

45:27.398 --> 45:28.196
He's
still cold, Bill.

45:28.198 --> 45:29.432
Get him up now.

45:29.434 --> 45:30.365
Oh no,
he's breathing,

45:30.367 --> 45:31.600
he's breathing, he's fine.

45:31.602 --> 45:32.535
He's making the
place look miserable.

45:32.537 --> 45:34.305
Go fuck yourself.

45:35.472 --> 45:38.740
Hey, it's on, the fight's on!

45:38.742 --> 45:39.675
At Appleby?

45:39.677 --> 45:41.077
Yeah, at Appleby!

45:41.079 --> 45:42.178
Oi, don't chat shit,
that's sick, blud!

45:42.180 --> 45:42.812
Sick, what does that mean?

45:42.814 --> 45:44.446
Is that good or bad?

45:44.448 --> 45:45.481
Well, good, man.

45:45.483 --> 45:46.515
Oh, right.

45:47.818 --> 45:49.617
Well, I guess that's
goodbye for a while.

45:49.619 --> 45:50.452
What?

45:50.454 --> 45:51.586
What?

45:51.588 --> 45:52.320
What do you mean, goodbye?

45:52.322 --> 45:53.222
The fight.

45:53.224 --> 45:54.590
If it's on I have to go.

45:54.592 --> 45:55.423
No, no, no, no, no.

45:55.425 --> 45:56.459
We have to go, man, we.

45:56.461 --> 45:58.260
And I'm your corner, captain.

45:58.262 --> 45:59.495
I'm your manager
and your promoter.

45:59.497 --> 46:00.463
I've managed all sorts.

46:00.465 --> 46:01.564
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm your second, blud.

46:01.566 --> 46:02.530
I'm your assistant.

46:02.532 --> 46:03.467
I'm yours.

46:08.673 --> 46:09.508
Your nurse.

46:12.642 --> 46:15.313
It's okay, I get it.

46:16.881 --> 46:18.680
I don't wanna slow you down,

46:18.682 --> 46:22.053
so you just make sure you
bring back what you need.

46:24.188 --> 46:25.754
I don't have a trainer.

46:25.756 --> 46:26.658
Damn this thing.

46:28.892 --> 46:30.526
Have I got to tow you myself?

46:30.528 --> 46:32.495
Get in the back of the truck.

46:32.497 --> 46:33.629
Yeah?

46:33.631 --> 46:34.466
Yeah.

46:36.267 --> 46:39.468
Oh, man, thanks, Doug.

46:39.470 --> 46:41.639
Nobody gets left behind.

46:45.510 --> 46:46.642
All for one.

46:46.644 --> 46:48.176
- Yeah.
- All for one!

46:49.380 --> 46:51.312
Ooh, left, left,
left, left, left hook.

46:55.186 --> 46:55.821
Bill.

46:57.555 --> 46:58.189
Bill!

46:59.890 --> 47:02.291
You got yourself a challenger.

47:02.293 --> 47:05.160
Big feckin' Gypsy
fella, you know him.

47:05.162 --> 47:06.195
A dirty fucking Gypsy?

47:06.197 --> 47:06.832
Nosher.

47:08.465 --> 47:10.701
That big simple-headed
fellow wants another try?

47:11.869 --> 47:13.738
Wants to fight you
at Appleby though.

47:14.704 --> 47:15.637
At the fair so?

47:15.639 --> 47:17.675
That's a big fecking crowd so!

47:18.642 --> 47:20.742
Fecking big pot
at 25 a head, now.

47:20.744 --> 47:23.447
They'll all want to
see you knacker him.

47:25.249 --> 47:27.552

49:21.432 --> 49:22.267
Mm.

49:24.302 --> 49:25.901
How are you doing, partner?

49:25.903 --> 49:30.909
Well now, alongside the
invigorating conversation,

49:32.008 --> 49:33.075
seating arrangements
that would irk

49:33.077 --> 49:34.713
and torment the Marquis de Sade,

49:36.380 --> 49:40.017
I'd say that's easily my least
favorite five hours on earth.

49:41.718 --> 49:42.820
But thanks for asking.

49:48.659 --> 49:50.459
Right, you lot.

49:50.461 --> 49:51.660
- Who was driving?
- Me.

49:51.662 --> 49:52.695
- Give me...
- Come on, lad, come on, mate.

49:52.697 --> 49:53.762
Drop 'em here, boy.

50:16.787 --> 50:18.854
Christ almighty.

50:18.856 --> 50:19.691
Charmed.

50:20.925 --> 50:22.791
Oh, no, I meant.

50:22.793 --> 50:24.396
I know exactly what you meant.

50:32.836 --> 50:34.769
Is he any good?

50:34.771 --> 50:38.774
I mean, I haven't even seen him
move around or anything yet.

50:38.776 --> 50:42.410
Oh, don't worry about it.

50:42.412 --> 50:43.945
I have to worry about it.

50:43.947 --> 50:45.646
If we're gonna be training him,

50:45.648 --> 50:47.082
I need to know what to tighten
up, what needs attention,

50:47.084 --> 50:49.053
I, I've only got a few days.

50:50.653 --> 50:52.854
It's not really like that.

50:52.856 --> 50:56.091
Gypsy fighting, it's all about
who can stand the longest.

50:56.093 --> 50:58.459
Who can endure the
most pain, it's...

50:58.461 --> 51:00.762
Mm, like boxing.

51:00.764 --> 51:02.997
The Irish, it's
all about brawn.

51:02.999 --> 51:03.867
They're clubbers.

51:05.735 --> 51:09.006
Whereas Nosher, Nosh can move.

51:10.407 --> 51:11.809
He's surprisingly
light on his feet.

51:13.943 --> 51:16.613
- Mm.
- You'll be amazed, trust me.

51:17.947 --> 51:22.853
But what about, you
know, his head and that?

51:24.188 --> 51:25.954
He's a happy boy, that's all.

51:25.956 --> 51:27.955
Oh, yeah, I know.

51:27.957 --> 51:30.626
I, I didn't mean it like that.

51:30.628 --> 51:35.463
I just mean for fighting,
you need to be superhuman.

51:35.465 --> 51:38.402
He is superhuman,
he's a super human.

51:39.970 --> 51:44.943
Yeah, sorry, I, you know,
I didn't mean it like that.

51:49.780 --> 51:51.615
You know, I got a
lot riding on this.

51:53.517 --> 51:58.490
You, you know, you make a few
quid, but this is it for me.

51:59.823 --> 52:00.892
He fails, I fail,

52:03.126 --> 52:03.760
again.

52:05.829 --> 52:07.131
You might feel like a loser,

52:08.499 --> 52:12.470
you might even look
like a bit of a loser,

52:15.673 --> 52:17.709
but you've gotta stop
looking behind you.

52:19.108 --> 52:20.508
If you keep looking behind you,

52:20.510 --> 52:22.813
all you're gonna
get is a stiff neck.

52:48.539 --> 52:49.407
Come on, Nosh.

52:52.876 --> 52:56.278
Come on, Nosh, let's
see them feet move.

52:56.280 --> 52:57.548
Let me see you dribble.

52:59.082 --> 53:00.050
Whoa!

53:02.253 --> 53:05.088
No, power's useless
without control.

53:12.930 --> 53:14.896
Let's try some pads.

53:14.898 --> 53:16.567
Riz, glove up.

53:17.767 --> 53:19.570
Show Nosher how to
control his power.

53:27.311 --> 53:29.914
And remember, balance, control.

53:44.928 --> 53:46.664
That's good.

53:53.137 --> 53:55.736
Wow.

53:55.738 --> 53:57.171
Time.

53:57.173 --> 54:00.041
Nosher, you're up.

54:00.043 --> 54:02.977
Remember, control.

54:02.979 --> 54:03.879
That's good.

54:03.881 --> 54:04.912
Balance.

54:04.914 --> 54:06.113
Jab.

54:06.115 --> 54:07.682
Jab.

54:07.684 --> 54:09.050
Left, right.

54:09.052 --> 54:10.785
Good, balance.

54:10.787 --> 54:11.954
One, two.

54:11.956 --> 54:14.021
Good, one, two.

54:14.023 --> 54:15.057
Jab.

54:15.059 --> 54:15.957
Jab.

54:17.061 --> 54:18.530
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

54:19.296 --> 54:20.131
Sorry.

54:21.264 --> 54:23.198
- Blimey.
- Sorry.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.736
What was that?

54:27.671 --> 54:28.939
Christ, Nosher!

54:32.642 --> 54:34.144
This guy's a
professional fighter.

54:36.079 --> 54:37.211
He'll destroy you in seconds

54:37.213 --> 54:39.082
if you don't take
this seriously.

54:41.151 --> 54:43.684
You're gonna get
hurt, you pillock!

54:43.686 --> 54:45.988
It's just gonna take
a while, that's all.

54:45.990 --> 54:47.792
We don't have a while.

54:50.727 --> 54:51.994
He's heading for a bloodbath

54:51.996 --> 54:53.331
if he doesn't get
his act together.

54:57.767 --> 54:59.736
Hold on, let me try.

55:01.305 --> 55:03.140
I know what it's
like to be different.

55:04.008 --> 55:06.975
Come on, big man, over here.

55:06.977 --> 55:09.077
We got a new game to play.

55:10.881 --> 55:12.113
Catch this!

55:12.115 --> 55:14.249
Watch out now, it's heavy.

55:14.251 --> 55:15.653
It's not a football.

55:20.256 --> 55:21.390
That's it, my son.

55:21.392 --> 55:24.026
Yes, and again.

55:24.028 --> 55:25.129
Give it some muscle.

55:26.095 --> 55:26.930
Come on.

55:28.365 --> 55:29.330
Watch out.

55:30.700 --> 55:33.303
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

55:35.305 --> 55:37.207
Yeah, there you go.

55:38.041 --> 55:39.910
That's our champion.

55:41.412 --> 55:43.214
He's like bloody
King Kong, him!

55:46.215 --> 55:47.149
I'm gonna go and help him.

55:47.151 --> 55:48.450
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

55:48.452 --> 55:49.283
No, he needs help.

55:49.285 --> 55:50.919
He'll snarl at ya!

55:50.921 --> 55:52.120
You all right, Davros?

55:52.122 --> 55:54.088
No, don't you touch me!

55:54.090 --> 55:56.925
Don't you come near me,
you patronizing snot!

55:56.927 --> 55:58.359
You little bag of puke!

55:58.361 --> 56:00.928
I will rip your fingers off!

56:00.930 --> 56:01.863
Don't look at me!

56:01.865 --> 56:03.064
Told ya.

56:03.066 --> 56:05.133
I'll eat you alive!

56:05.135 --> 56:06.934
Don't look at me!

56:06.936 --> 56:09.271
None of you look at me!

56:12.876 --> 56:15.309
We've got a tiger by the tail.

56:18.081 --> 56:19.448
Go on, Nosh!

56:19.450 --> 56:20.849
Woohoo!

56:23.387 --> 56:25.053
Ah, that's just wrong, man!

56:25.055 --> 56:27.091
He's doing it right, he's
just finding his level.

56:28.258 --> 56:29.093
Wee!

56:30.193 --> 56:31.727
Wee hee!

56:31.729 --> 56:33.861
Come on, Nosh, you
can do it, mate!

56:33.863 --> 56:35.463
Bombs away!

56:35.465 --> 56:37.365
Oh my, oh!

56:37.367 --> 56:39.300
Oh my dizzy days!

56:40.970 --> 56:42.504
Now he's done it, bloody hell!

56:42.506 --> 56:43.939
Do you see that?!

56:43.941 --> 56:45.173
Will you
be my best friend?

56:45.175 --> 56:46.374
Do it.

56:46.376 --> 56:48.680
So long as you be mine!

56:49.880 --> 56:52.717
Will one of you
pricks help me up?

57:00.023 --> 57:01.726
I tell you what, Nosh.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.327
When I was in the Navy,

57:05.329 --> 57:09.100
we had to do exactly
what we were told to.

57:09.999 --> 57:11.932
You was in the Navy?

57:11.934 --> 57:13.270
Driving ships?

57:14.771 --> 57:17.007
The most important
lesson I learnt

57:18.207 --> 57:22.046
is that it takes a lot of
parts to make a good machine.

57:24.481 --> 57:26.782
It's a bit like us here.

57:26.784 --> 57:31.222
We've all got special jobs to
do to make this mission work.

57:32.956 --> 57:35.459
And you have got the most
important job of all.

57:38.427 --> 57:41.530
Beating Big Bill
Brady, of course!

57:41.532 --> 57:45.267
And only you can
do that, only you.

57:45.269 --> 57:48.272
My best mate in all
the world, Nosher.

57:50.206 --> 57:51.807
I'm a good lad, I am.

57:51.809 --> 57:53.211
You are.

57:57.146 --> 57:58.280
Yo, Doug.

57:58.282 --> 58:00.981
I swear down, man, he's
like, he's like a freakin'.

58:00.983 --> 58:01.952
Cyclops.

58:03.954 --> 58:06.187
You know, Clash of the
Titans, double strong.

58:06.189 --> 58:07.291
You know what I mean.

58:08.959 --> 58:12.193
He swiped that caravan
like it was a fly.

58:12.195 --> 58:13.864
Yeah, so he's strong.

58:15.097 --> 58:16.263
So's Brady.

58:16.265 --> 58:18.033
Yeah, but it's
always been like that.

58:18.035 --> 58:19.937
Like he hits like
most of us can kick.

58:21.238 --> 58:23.338
That's a tiny part of it.

58:23.340 --> 58:25.039
Boxing's the only game

58:25.041 --> 58:27.244
where David can actually beat
Goliath if he uses his head.

58:28.512 --> 58:30.945
Brady knows how to play the
game, you can count on that.

58:30.947 --> 58:32.113
And he will destroy...

58:32.115 --> 58:33.849
Yo, Douglas,
Dougie, Doug, D-dot.

58:33.851 --> 58:36.218
I hate to break it
down for you man.

58:36.220 --> 58:37.889
These mans ain't fighting.

58:39.222 --> 58:41.590
They're straight
'tumping each other, G!

58:41.592 --> 58:43.059
It's not boxing, man.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.463
They're like shaved
bears, innit.

58:48.097 --> 58:49.266
Yeah, we'll see.

58:53.436 --> 58:55.003
The doctor
said to me, Mick,

58:55.005 --> 58:57.207
never go for a pee on your own.

58:58.175 --> 58:59.240
What?

58:59.242 --> 59:00.941
Yeah, he said I shouldn't
lift anything heavy.

59:03.981 --> 59:04.912
- Dav?
- Yeah?

59:04.914 --> 59:06.146
See you back in the truck.

59:06.148 --> 59:07.615
Get some chewing gum, will ya?

59:07.617 --> 59:08.451
Yeah.

59:11.454 --> 59:13.120
Me fecking back.

59:13.122 --> 59:14.555
We should have bloody
flown up in the airplane.

59:14.557 --> 59:17.225
Jesus, how many
more miles now, huh?

59:17.227 --> 59:18.894
Shut
your fecking whining.

59:18.896 --> 59:20.361
You're like a fecking pup!

59:20.363 --> 59:21.930
Right, but it's, it's
not good for his body

59:21.932 --> 59:23.398
before the fight, neither.

59:23.400 --> 59:25.966
Don't you be
worrying about my body now.

59:25.968 --> 59:26.901
I'll be shutting young Nosher up

59:26.903 --> 59:29.306
in nothing but a minute or two.

59:30.439 --> 59:32.374
Look, I know
that, all right.

59:32.376 --> 59:34.276
I just wanna make sure
you're ready for the fight.

59:34.278 --> 59:37.512
I'll rip that
Nosher's head off, I tell ya.

59:37.514 --> 59:39.680
No splashing, Bridget.

59:42.352 --> 59:46.991
Well, brother, are you
shitting or are you texting?

59:48.457 --> 59:52.997
Well now, I have two hands
and one arse so, to be sure.

59:55.331 --> 59:56.597
Do you hear that, Bridget?

59:56.599 --> 59:58.466
He says he's got two
hands and one arse.

59:58.468 --> 01:00:00.401
Aye, he's blessed sure enough.

01:00:00.403 --> 01:00:03.271
'Course, some of
us have two arses.

01:00:03.273 --> 01:00:05.707
One for shitting and
one for thinking.

01:00:05.709 --> 01:00:07.608
Now give the poor
fella his phone back

01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.413
and don't be looking at it
pretending you can read, now.

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:14.349
There you are, brother.

01:00:16.686 --> 01:00:20.254
Thank you so, to be sure.

01:00:20.256 --> 01:00:21.256
No bother.

01:00:30.733 --> 01:00:32.334
You all right there, fella?

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:33.371
Aye.

01:00:34.338 --> 01:00:35.907
I'll see you back
at the fair, so.

01:00:36.639 --> 01:00:38.138
So you will, brother.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.506
You'll come watch
our man, Big Bill,

01:00:39.508 --> 01:00:40.441
pull the fecking head

01:00:40.443 --> 01:00:43.979
off that dirty Gypsy
bastard.

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:47.682
4.60 pounds, please.

01:00:47.684 --> 01:00:48.649
Right, there you go.

01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:49.619
Thank you.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.195
Call your
boyfriend back later.

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:00.932
I'm hungry.

01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:14.274
Off to the fair now?

01:01:14.276 --> 01:01:15.111
Yeah.

01:01:24.354 --> 01:01:28.392
But then it's just as
fast, the whole bloody lot.

01:01:33.262 --> 01:01:35.696
Are you all right, Doug?

01:01:35.698 --> 01:01:37.532
He can't win.

01:01:37.534 --> 01:01:39.166
What do you mean?

01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:40.401
Bill Brady's in there.

01:01:40.403 --> 01:01:41.236
What?

01:01:41.238 --> 01:01:42.473
I just saw him.

01:01:43.407 --> 01:01:45.609
He's like a bloody oil rig.

01:01:46.742 --> 01:01:48.309
Our man can't win.

01:01:48.311 --> 01:01:50.412
Look at
the size of him!

01:01:50.414 --> 01:01:53.314
OMG, he's bigger
than Donkey Kong!

01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:54.485
He's a monster!

01:01:58.555 --> 01:02:01.423
Hey, yo, what's my
man Davros doing, fam?

01:02:01.425 --> 01:02:04.528
I think
he's having a fit.

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:16.140
Thai chi.

01:02:21.343 --> 01:02:22.178
Look at that idiot.

01:02:23.479 --> 01:02:25.081
Fecking Thai Chi.

01:02:36.492 --> 01:02:38.094
Who's the girl in your wallet?

01:02:39.563 --> 01:02:42.129
It fell out your pocket the
other day at the campsite.

01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:44.168
I wanted to ask you then but I.

01:02:46.336 --> 01:02:47.171
My daughter.

01:02:49.506 --> 01:02:50.637
Where is she?

01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:52.506
I don't know.

01:02:52.508 --> 01:02:57.113
Her mum, she, she took my money

01:02:59.182 --> 01:03:01.651
and she moved on
to a bigger wallet,

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.490
and when she bled him out,
she took off with Melissa.

01:03:08.592 --> 01:03:09.626
Disappeared.

01:03:11.528 --> 01:03:14.829
She was only five.

01:03:14.831 --> 01:03:16.367
Well, how old is she now?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.235
12.

01:03:19.503 --> 01:03:21.205
What, and you've
never found her?

01:03:23.539 --> 01:03:25.508
I looked for years.

01:03:27.244 --> 01:03:29.814
I trawled Eastern Europe
with nothing to go on.

01:03:32.682 --> 01:03:33.617
It's messy.

01:03:43.626 --> 01:03:44.561
I can help you.

01:03:47.564 --> 01:03:51.302
We'll just get through this and
then I'll help you find her.

01:03:52.602 --> 01:03:56.240
I know all kinds of people,
especially in Eastern Europe.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.608
Good people.

01:03:59.476 --> 01:04:02.646
Just do your stuff
with Nosher, yeah?

01:04:04.613 --> 01:04:06.548
Come on, my son!

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:07.416
Come on, Nosh.

01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:14.457
One, one, two.

01:04:19.729 --> 01:04:21.428
Now I tell ya,

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.564
you put every penny you
have on this fight, right.

01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:25.966
You put your dogs on it, yeah?

01:04:30.941 --> 01:04:34.211
Go on, my son, go
on, go on, go on!

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:37.778
You're the winner, you're the
winner, you're the winner!

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.914
You're the champ,
you're the champ!

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:42.720
You're the winner, yes you are!

01:04:45.588 --> 01:04:47.754
Ram it, pound it!

01:04:47.756 --> 01:04:48.756
Grind it!

01:04:50.727 --> 01:04:52.227
Come on, that's it!

01:04:54.564 --> 01:04:55.729
That's the one!

01:04:55.731 --> 01:04:56.699
Keep it going!

01:04:58.501 --> 01:04:59.336
Yeah.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:23.427
Come on, Nosh!

01:05:24.427 --> 01:05:25.963
Come on, Nosher, lad.

01:05:29.666 --> 01:05:31.568
Keep going, keep going!

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.407
Woohoo!

01:05:52.389 --> 01:05:54.756
Beautiful people
allowed in my gym.

01:05:54.758 --> 01:05:58.059
No ugly people, no fat people.

01:05:58.061 --> 01:06:00.764
This is gonna be a
monument to glory.

01:06:01.798 --> 01:06:05.399
Gym, my name, my gym.

01:06:05.401 --> 01:06:07.501
We're gonna have fully
branded clothing.

01:06:07.503 --> 01:06:09.771
State of the art,
beautiful stuff.

01:06:09.773 --> 01:06:10.671
Modeled for you now.

01:06:25.921 --> 01:06:26.823
- Go.
- Sorry.

01:06:57.787 --> 01:06:59.590
It's cool, innit.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.468
Mum!

01:07:18.675 --> 01:07:21.577
Poster's got
Nosher's face on it.

01:07:27.383 --> 01:07:29.950
Albert, over here!

01:07:29.952 --> 01:07:31.753
Romany Air Force!

01:07:31.755 --> 01:07:33.988
Battle of Brady, come on!

01:07:36.392 --> 01:07:37.124
Boom!

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:39.496
Albert, come on!

01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:51.809
You all right, Albert?

01:07:52.742 --> 01:07:53.573
I think so, captain.

01:07:53.575 --> 01:07:56.380
Just bit of gut
ache, that's all.

01:07:58.014 --> 01:08:00.584
Maybe sit this one out, eh?

01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:02.916
That thing I was
telling you about, innit.

01:08:02.918 --> 01:08:03.850
Albert!

01:08:08.691 --> 01:08:10.892
Are you all right, Albert?

01:08:10.894 --> 01:08:12.496
I'm okay, Nosh.

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:16.733
Just a bit of stomach
ache, that's all.

01:08:20.702 --> 01:08:22.970
I'm getting on a bit.

01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:24.006
I might have overdone it.

01:08:29.879 --> 01:08:31.715
Albert, darling,
give me your wrist.

01:08:34.917 --> 01:08:38.087
Mick, what's wrong
with Albert, fam?

01:08:42.058 --> 01:08:44.591
I think we should nip
you to a hospital, okay?

01:08:44.594 --> 01:08:45.929
No, it's okay.

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:48.863
It's just a precaution.

01:08:48.865 --> 01:08:49.700
The fight.

01:08:51.099 --> 01:08:51.934
Nosh.

01:08:52.835 --> 01:08:53.966
No!

01:08:53.969 --> 01:08:55.868
Ambulance, get an ambulance.

01:09:02.978 --> 01:09:04.881
Okay, thank you.

01:09:11.153 --> 01:09:12.819
What's the verdict?

01:09:12.821 --> 01:09:15.523
Well, I'm afraid poor
Albert isn't going anywhere.

01:09:15.524 --> 01:09:16.756
They're gonna give him a scan

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:18.993
and then they may have
to operate immediately.

01:09:18.995 --> 01:09:21.832
But can he come
to the fight then?

01:09:22.932 --> 01:09:24.768
Don't think there's
gonna be a fight, Nosh.

01:09:25.969 --> 01:09:27.968
We can't go through
with it after this.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.773
But Albert's proud of me.

01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:34.076
I was gonna make
him really proud.

01:09:43.018 --> 01:09:45.586
I'm already proud, Nosh.

01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:48.992
Albert, I'm sorry
that you're poorly.

01:09:53.562 --> 01:09:55.131
I need you to help me,

01:09:56.965 --> 01:09:59.068
to do something amazing.

01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:07.611
I want you to carry on
without me, all right?

01:10:08.811 --> 01:10:09.912
Just think of me

01:10:12.915 --> 01:10:14.016
and be my best friend.

01:10:17.186 --> 01:10:19.723
That's your special
job, all right?

01:10:36.638 --> 01:10:39.208
And kill Big Bill
Brady to death!

01:10:57.093 --> 01:11:01.999
Come on, that
boy's gonna win some money!

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.137
24 quid.

01:11:16.144 --> 01:11:17.377
All your money on him, now.

01:11:17.379 --> 01:11:18.279
- All your money on him.
- You got your money

01:11:18.281 --> 01:11:19.779
on me, boys?

01:11:19.781 --> 01:11:22.084
I tell ya, I'm gonna kill him!

01:11:27.956 --> 01:11:29.222
I can't hear you!

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.861
Yeah, it sounds like her.

01:11:34.863 --> 01:11:36.663
Send me the number.

01:11:36.665 --> 01:11:38.067
All right then, bye.

01:11:41.137 --> 01:11:43.037
He's going down in two, boys.

01:11:43.039 --> 01:11:44.238
He's going down in two.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.840
I can't hear you, lads!

01:11:45.842 --> 01:11:47.007
Let's go, Bill!

01:11:47.009 --> 01:11:48.642
Look at him, he hasn't got
a clue what's coming to him.

01:11:48.644 --> 01:11:49.275
He hasn't got a clue.

01:11:49.277 --> 01:11:50.910
He hasn't got a prayer!

01:11:55.884 --> 01:11:57.083
Whatever you do, Nosh,

01:11:57.085 --> 01:11:59.285
don't go full pace
with him, all right?

01:11:59.287 --> 01:12:00.954
He's a big man like you.

01:12:00.956 --> 01:12:03.391
He's gonna run out of
energy quickly, all right?

01:12:03.393 --> 01:12:06.360
Let him try and hit you
and just keep dodging

01:12:06.362 --> 01:12:09.166
and wait till he slows down
before you attack, okay?

01:12:10.133 --> 01:12:11.231
You scared, boy?

01:12:11.233 --> 01:12:13.100
I don't like him.

01:12:15.804 --> 01:12:17.106
Me neither, pal.

01:12:18.273 --> 01:12:19.875
Albert hates him.

01:12:21.177 --> 01:12:22.776
You're going
home in a box, boy.

01:12:22.778 --> 01:12:24.145
Now listen, for
the first round,

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:26.312
I need you to keep your arms up.

01:12:26.314 --> 01:12:28.048
No, Doug, wait, look.

01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:29.816
What, what, what, what?

01:12:29.818 --> 01:12:31.918
There are no rounds.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.852
What?

01:12:32.854 --> 01:12:33.887
How do I speak to Nosher?

01:12:33.889 --> 01:12:37.190
If he goes
down, you help him, okay?

01:12:37.192 --> 01:12:40.794
You better ring an
ambulance, boy, I tell ya!

01:12:40.796 --> 01:12:42.328
Listen to me,
Nosh, listen to me.

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.066
I need you to keep dodging
until you hear me shout, okay?

01:12:46.068 --> 01:12:48.101
I'm gonna shout Albert when
I want you to let fly, okay?

01:12:48.103 --> 01:12:49.470
What am I gonna shout?

01:12:49.472 --> 01:12:50.738
Albert!

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.705
That's right, blud!

01:12:51.707 --> 01:12:53.175
We're right here, you feel me!

01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:58.145
Get out the
ring, I wanna fight now!

01:12:58.147 --> 01:12:59.349
Be lucky, Nosh.

01:13:02.117 --> 01:13:03.284
Let's go!

01:13:03.286 --> 01:13:04.217
- Come on!
- You're going home in a box,

01:13:04.219 --> 01:13:05.252
I tell ya.

01:13:05.254 --> 01:13:06.319
Come on, Nosher.

01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:07.320
He's ready to
go, boy, you ready to go?

01:13:07.322 --> 01:13:08.989
Yeah, I'm ready.

01:13:08.991 --> 01:13:12.392
Come on, boy, this is what
you came for, come on!

01:13:12.394 --> 01:13:13.727
- Oh, please.
- Ready, Big Bill?

01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:14.328
- Ready?
- I'm gonna rip your head off!

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:15.762
Fight!

01:13:25.974 --> 01:13:28.042
Come on, hit him!

01:13:28.044 --> 01:13:29.880
Come on, Nosh!

01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:36.516
Referee!

01:13:36.518 --> 01:13:38.785
Referee, that's a foul!

01:13:38.787 --> 01:13:40.421
Ref, he butted him!

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:55.802
His eye!

01:13:55.804 --> 01:13:56.439
Do him!

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:02.810
Yes, yes!

01:14:02.812 --> 01:14:04.244
That's
it, you've got him!

01:14:04.246 --> 01:14:05.413
Get up now,
Bill, come on, get up.

01:14:05.415 --> 01:14:07.213
You'll have to use your feet,
this fella's too strong.

01:14:07.215 --> 01:14:09.151
Get out of it!

01:14:10.152 --> 01:14:10.986
Come on!

01:14:13.022 --> 01:14:15.088
Come on, there's
big money on this!

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:15.925
Get up!

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:17.960
Let's go!

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.386
Finish him, Nosher!

01:14:46.388 --> 01:14:49.123
Come on, come on, finish him!

01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:50.958
Keep him down!

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.293
Don't let
him stand up, Nosher!

01:14:57.232 --> 01:14:58.134
Finish him!

01:15:00.001 --> 01:15:01.601
Hit him again!

01:15:01.603 --> 01:15:03.069
Go on, you big lump!

01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:04.140
Nearly there!

01:15:28.865 --> 01:15:30.500
No, come on, Nosher!

01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:34.237
Albert!

01:15:35.905 --> 01:15:37.174
Albert, Albert!

01:15:38.473 --> 01:15:39.974
No!

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.245
Something's wrong.

01:15:45.247 --> 01:15:46.282
No.

01:15:53.923 --> 01:15:56.489
What the hell was that?

01:15:56.491 --> 01:15:57.524
You kicked him,
you bloody cheat!

01:15:57.526 --> 01:15:58.359
He was down before the kick.

01:15:58.361 --> 01:16:00.261
It was a fair win!

01:16:00.263 --> 01:16:01.395
Was it, balls!

01:16:01.397 --> 01:16:03.096
You're in it together!

01:16:03.098 --> 01:16:04.297
Away, boy!

01:16:04.299 --> 01:16:05.532
Someone threw
pepper in his eyes!

01:16:05.534 --> 01:16:07.434
Nosher, Nosher, are
you all right, son?

01:16:07.436 --> 01:16:08.405
I can't see.

01:16:11.173 --> 01:16:12.474
It's okay, Nosh.

01:16:14.442 --> 01:16:15.309
It's over.

01:16:15.311 --> 01:16:16.443
No.

01:16:16.445 --> 01:16:19.279
Not fair, they cheated.

01:16:19.281 --> 01:16:20.280
- Come on.
- Get him up,

01:16:20.282 --> 01:16:21.148
get him up.

01:16:24.519 --> 01:16:25.919
That's it.

01:16:25.921 --> 01:16:27.421
Bastards, we
should have known!

01:16:31.326 --> 01:16:33.459
We can still do this.

01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:34.560
What?

01:16:34.562 --> 01:16:36.396
You take him on.

01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:37.400
I'll deal with the rest.

01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:41.168
He'll kill me.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.005
No, he won't!

01:16:42.972 --> 01:16:45.204
You just box him like
you've been saying.

01:16:45.206 --> 01:16:47.207
You just keep him
here for a while.

01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:48.943
You can do it!

01:16:48.945 --> 01:16:51.110
I saw you in the pub.

01:16:51.112 --> 01:16:53.279
You're in a different class.

01:16:53.281 --> 01:16:54.416
You can do this.

01:16:57.687 --> 01:17:00.423
Let's just do what we
came to do, yeah, yeah?

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:06.528
All or nothing.

01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:11.198
If he beats our man,
I'll double the pot.

01:17:12.601 --> 01:17:15.703
If we win, we take every penny.

01:17:15.705 --> 01:17:17.171
You will have to pay though.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:18.705
They will come for it.

01:17:18.707 --> 01:17:21.510
I'm Roma, I live by honor.

01:17:28.049 --> 01:17:29.416
Hey, boy.

01:17:29.418 --> 01:17:30.516
- Forget about him.
- That's a good looking woman.

01:17:30.518 --> 01:17:31.385
Don't look at him.

01:17:31.387 --> 01:17:34.357
I'll have her
after the fight too.

01:17:35.357 --> 01:17:37.994
That was just a warm up, son.

01:17:39.362 --> 01:17:41.462
I'll squash you like a fly.

01:17:43.465 --> 01:17:45.501
And show you no mercy, boy.

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:56.677
Yeah, that's it
boy, take a picture.

01:17:56.679 --> 01:17:58.311
Good luck, blud.

01:17:58.313 --> 01:18:00.180
You won't recognize
him when I'm finished.

01:18:00.182 --> 01:18:02.548
Say goodbye to your teeth, boy.

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:06.055
Kiss
your arse goodbye, boy.

01:18:13.429 --> 01:18:15.328
There's no
bother warming up, boy.

01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.099
This won't take long.

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:33.379
Yes!

01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:34.213
Yes!

01:18:34.215 --> 01:18:35.481
Go on, hit him!

01:18:35.483 --> 01:18:36.449
Come on, come on, Doug!

01:18:36.451 --> 01:18:38.584
Come on, let's go!

01:18:38.586 --> 01:18:40.557
You want a fight.

01:18:49.764 --> 01:18:50.599
Yes!

01:19:11.187 --> 01:19:12.185

01:19:12.187 --> 01:19:13.453

01:19:14.424 --> 01:19:17.157
Well, I, I, I'm just

Aye, I've been travelling
all over Europe, yeah.

You're not an Irishman,
you must be a mangy Gypsy!

Looks like the
mange took his legs.

fella a hand, will ya?
