01:54.560 --> 01:56.000
Alright, students!

01:56.040 --> 01:58.400
You have the first half of class

01:58.440 --> 02:00.960
to rehearse your scenes.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.260
Then you'll have a chance to

02:02.261 --> 02:03.520
perform in front of the group,

02:03.560 --> 02:05.360
starting with Scene One.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.800
[grumbling murmur]

02:06.840 --> 02:08.120
C'mon, my dears.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.320
No one will make fun of you.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.560
Just express your emotions.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.120
That's theatre.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
That's performance.

02:15.161 --> 02:16.161
That's drama!

02:17.640 --> 02:20.000
Oh, there'll be drama alright.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.640
Yes, Violetta?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.320
Ms. Bulworth,

02:27.360 --> 02:28.700
I know you think

02:28.701 --> 02:30.040
I should be the romantic lead,

02:30.080 --> 02:31.960
because I'm that fabulous,

02:32.000 --> 02:33.240
but I'm actually thinking

02:33.241 --> 02:34.480
it should go to...

02:34.520 --> 02:36.000
Mia.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.760
Really?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.376
- Well, that's quite generous
- of you to give up

02:40.400 --> 02:42.000
The spotlight that way.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.456
- [Violetta] I just think
- she deserves

02:43.480 --> 02:44.840
- Some attention
- of her own.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.360
You know?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.120
You might be right.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.040
[Mia] Romantic lead?

02:56.080 --> 02:57.440
Me?

02:57.480 --> 02:58.720
Us?

02:58.760 --> 03:00.600
I'm sure you'll do just fine.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.240
So, Mia.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.760
What's your little book say

03:06.800 --> 03:08.440
about kissing frogs?

03:08.480 --> 03:10.760
- Does he turn into an elf prince?
- [Paula laughs]

03:10.800 --> 03:12.920
I bet you'd just love that!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.616
- How did you know...
- [Vincent] We have a...

03:14.640 --> 03:16.240
[gulps]

03:16.280 --> 03:17.560
kissing scene?

03:17.600 --> 03:19.120
Well, it just seems natural.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.080
You two make the perfect couple.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.320
Loser Couple

03:22.360 --> 03:24.120
Thanks!

03:24.160 --> 03:25.840
- Do you need to lie down,
- Vincent?

03:27.360 --> 03:29.240
- You look like
- you're going to faint.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.320
Break a leg, Mia!

03:33.400 --> 03:34.840
You break a leg.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.400
Okay.

03:37.401 --> 03:38.481
Let's be mature about this.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.860
We're teenagers.

03:39.861 --> 03:41.200
We can handle it.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.440
You've kissed someone before,

03:42.441 --> 03:43.640
right?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.640
Yeah. Of course I have!

03:47.680 --> 03:48.960
Yeah, me neither.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.800
Right well,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.720
we've seen people kiss in...

03:53.760 --> 03:54.980
you know, movies before.

03:54.981 --> 03:56.200
I mean... [chuckles nervously]

03:56.240 --> 03:57.800
How hard can it be?

04:01.440 --> 04:03.560
[clears throat]

04:05.280 --> 04:06.720
Here's the plan.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.640
- While Dweedface
- and Dweedface-ette there

04:08.680 --> 04:10.240
Are about to have

04:10.241 --> 04:11.800
their first kiss ever,

04:11.840 --> 04:13.220
we make sure the whole class

04:13.221 --> 04:14.600
is there to watch.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.120
Your job is to mock and scorn.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.399
This should be fun.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.656
- I've been dreaming
- of this moment

04:21.680 --> 04:23.560
Since the first day I met you.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.760
- [Vincent] Isn't it time we took
- the next step?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.880
[Mia] But we're such

04:26.881 --> 04:27.960
good friends. I...

04:29.280 --> 04:31.240
I don't want to ruin that.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.780
We'll still be friends. We'll

04:32.781 --> 04:34.280
just be... much more than that.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.840
How can you know that?

04:36.880 --> 04:38.480
How can we know?

04:38.520 --> 04:40.240
- There's only one way
- to find out.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.420
Yeah! Do it! Go on, Mia!

04:43.421 --> 04:44.560
Kiss your boyfriend!

04:44.600 --> 04:46.200
[all laugh]

04:46.240 --> 04:47.840
He's not my boyfriend!

04:47.880 --> 04:49.840
- I mean, ew!
- I don't even like him...!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.080
Yeah! I definitely

04:53.081 --> 04:54.160
don't like her either!

04:54.200 --> 04:56.120
- I mean... she's uh...
- She's a freak!

04:56.160 --> 04:57.560
Hey, take that back!

04:57.600 --> 04:59.320
[students laughing]

05:01.360 --> 05:02.640
Eem... Vincent.

05:02.641 --> 05:03.920
I'll be back soon!

05:13.360 --> 05:14.920
Better make this quick!

05:14.960 --> 05:17.160
Vincent, are you ready?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.280
- Mhmm...

05:18.281 --> 05:19.360
- Where's Mia?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.560
I don't know.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.360
Aw, the poor dear

05:23.361 --> 05:25.120
must have stage fright!

05:25.160 --> 05:27.560
What a shame.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.560
- I think we found
- Mia's understudy.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.960
Hi Mia.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.320
Say your password.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.500
"Treasures hide

05:44.501 --> 05:45.640
in a jungle tomb,

05:45.680 --> 05:46.960
where foes conspire

05:46.961 --> 05:48.240
to seal your doom."

05:59.800 --> 06:02.560
[screams]

06:05.440 --> 06:07.320
Aaw!

06:07.360 --> 06:08.840
[gasps]

06:08.880 --> 06:10.800
Ah! Munculus!

06:13.640 --> 06:15.200
Wait a second...

06:16.760 --> 06:17.920
AH!

06:17.960 --> 06:19.360
[Mo] Everyone, hold fire!

06:20.440 --> 06:21.760
Hey Mia!

06:23.840 --> 06:25.100
[giggles]

06:25.101 --> 06:26.360
That's hilarious!

06:26.400 --> 06:27.840
- [bites]
- Aagh!

06:27.880 --> 06:29.000
[Onchao neighs]

06:32.440 --> 06:33.600
Thanks, Onchao.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.680
[snorts]

06:35.760 --> 06:37.760
Mia! Nice of you to...

06:37.800 --> 06:39.760
Drop in on our training session!

06:39.800 --> 06:41.540
I do like to make

06:41.541 --> 06:43.280
a splashy entrance.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.560
These young Elves are

06:44.561 --> 06:45.800
practicing their WaterGlares.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.100
Until we find the other

06:47.101 --> 06:48.360
fifteen pieces of the Trumptus,

06:48.400 --> 06:49.440
it's the only way

06:49.441 --> 06:50.480
to fight off the Muncs!

06:50.520 --> 06:51.820
Hey, Mia...

06:51.821 --> 06:53.120
maybe you should give it a try!

06:53.160 --> 06:54.480
It's easy.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.720
First you fill it up

06:57.120 --> 06:58.320
like this...

07:00.720 --> 07:02.040
Then you aim,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.720
hold steady and fire!

07:04.760 --> 07:05.960
Try to hit that dummy.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.760
[clicks]

07:14.200 --> 07:15.260
FSSSHHH!

07:15.261 --> 07:16.320
Whoa...!

07:16.360 --> 07:17.420
[giggles]

07:17.421 --> 07:18.480
Wrong dummy.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.000
Ha, ha.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.040
Sorry! It's a little tricky!

07:22.080 --> 07:23.760
Don't think about it too much!

07:23.800 --> 07:25.080
Just focus on what you

07:25.081 --> 07:26.360
want to happen...

07:32.360 --> 07:34.200
and you can't miss!

07:34.240 --> 07:36.960
[laughs]

07:37.000 --> 07:38.640
This is fun and everything,

07:38.680 --> 07:40.416
- but do you guys want to hear
- the new oracle?

07:40.440 --> 07:41.880
Ooh! Let's hear it!

07:41.920 --> 07:43.560
This one's a little creepy:

07:43.600 --> 07:44.860
"Treasures hide

07:44.861 --> 07:46.120
in a jungle tomb,

07:46.160 --> 07:47.340
where foes conspire

07:47.341 --> 07:48.520
to seal your doom."

07:48.560 --> 07:49.720
Catchy!

07:49.760 --> 07:51.920
But yeah. Little creepy.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.060
Hmm. There's supposed

07:53.061 --> 07:54.160
to be an abandoned tomb

07:54.200 --> 07:55.640
somewhere on the western ridge.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.040
But it's a dangerous area,

07:57.080 --> 07:58.800
filled with Munculus soldiers!

07:58.840 --> 08:00.600
- I guess those
- would be the "foes"?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.280
You call 'em "foes."

08:02.320 --> 08:03.720
I call 'em "targets."

08:05.640 --> 08:06.880
It'll be fun!

08:06.920 --> 08:09.880
Three, two, one... FIRE!

08:12.160 --> 08:14.136
- [elves] (CHEERING) He, Heh!
- Nice shooting guys.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.040
Let's set up for one more round.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.200
Mwaaah, mwaah!

08:21.240 --> 08:22.320
[distant cheering]

08:22.360 --> 08:24.640
Duhh, aagh!

08:24.680 --> 08:26.280
Oow, those Elves

08:26.281 --> 08:27.880
and their infernal racket,

08:27.920 --> 08:29.780
disturbing me, Polytheus,

08:29.781 --> 08:31.640
while I count my gold!

08:31.680 --> 08:33.280
What could possibly arouse

08:33.280 --> 08:34.880
such a masterless commotion?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.740
[Mo] The part about treasure

08:42.741 --> 08:43.960
is strange, though...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.240
"Treasure"?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.800
Finally, they're gabbing

08:46.840 --> 08:48.680
about something worthwhile!

08:48.720 --> 08:50.480
If it's the Tomb of Skyohma,

08:50.520 --> 08:51.560
there's probably some

08:51.561 --> 08:52.601
really old stuff in there.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.240
- Some of that
- might be "treasure".

08:54.280 --> 08:55.480
So what're we waiting for?

08:55.481 --> 08:56.680
C'mon!

09:08.160 --> 09:10.200
Let me see...

09:10.240 --> 09:12.480
What did I do with that map?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.080
I know it's here somewhere.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.400
Ah! Here it is.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.280
Mwah, Mwah

09:22.320 --> 09:25.680
My ticket to tropes of treasure.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.600
Maybe I can pawn of some of

09:27.601 --> 09:29.480
these useless trinkets as well.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.120
Whoa! Easy, Onchao! Steady...

09:40.160 --> 09:41.280
I swear, the path

09:41.281 --> 09:42.400
should be right here.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.760
Did we take a wrong turn?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.280
Check it out!

09:46.320 --> 09:47.880
[Yuko] The Woodland Herd!

09:50.320 --> 09:52.400
[Mia] They're so beautiful!

09:52.440 --> 09:54.320
But aren't they in danger here?

09:54.360 --> 09:55.380
Dangerous or not,

09:55.381 --> 09:56.400
this is their home.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.660
[Mo] They're not gonna let

09:57.661 --> 09:58.880
some Muncs scare them away.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.080
[growling]

10:00.120 --> 10:02.000
[neigh]

10:02.040 --> 10:03.696
- Um, looks like
- they're a little scared!

10:03.720 --> 10:05.480
Quick, everyone get down!

10:12.280 --> 10:14.040
[Gargona] (SNIFFS) Ugh...

10:14.080 --> 10:16.100
This place positively

10:16.101 --> 10:18.120
reeks of unicorn!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.960
But where are they?!

10:21.440 --> 10:23.560
You must have scared them off!

10:23.600 --> 10:26.240
You incompetent fool!

10:26.280 --> 10:28.640
Can't you fly any quieter?!

10:28.680 --> 10:29.960
[munc shrieks]

10:32.240 --> 10:33.880
That was close.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.300
Yeah! This close to soaking

10:35.301 --> 10:36.680
some ugly muncs!

10:36.720 --> 10:38.040
We should stick to the ground.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.080
It's slower, but safer.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.640
[neighs]

10:53.720 --> 10:55.280
Ah! You said something

10:55.281 --> 10:56.840
about "safer"?

10:56.880 --> 10:58.520
Just move quietly and carefully.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.160
This whole jungle is alive.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.000
[Yuko] Alive and fun!

11:02.040 --> 11:04.280
Wheeeee! [laughs]

11:04.320 --> 11:06.440
[Mo] Yuko, knock it off!

11:06.480 --> 11:07.540
The path to that tomb

11:07.541 --> 11:08.600
has to be this way.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.160
Unless it's back there.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.120
[Mo] Did we miss the turn off?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.100
[Yuko] Ugh! You still

11:21.101 --> 11:22.360
don't know the way?

11:22.400 --> 11:23.840
Excellent!

11:23.880 --> 11:25.380
Lost elves means

11:25.381 --> 11:26.880
a head start for me!

11:27.960 --> 11:30.240
Top speed, my turtle!

11:30.280 --> 11:31.760
[Polytheus] Slow and steady

11:31.761 --> 11:33.240
wins nothing!

11:42.840 --> 11:44.280
Oh you... just...

11:44.281 --> 11:45.720
just ugh... Oh!

11:45.760 --> 11:49.000
Unhand the merchandise!

11:49.040 --> 11:50.080
[screams]

11:50.120 --> 11:51.480
[grunts]

11:51.520 --> 11:52.920
[Polytheus] HELP!

11:52.960 --> 11:56.560
Help? Somebody... Help me!

11:56.600 --> 11:58.480
- Do you guys hear that?
- Sounds like...

11:58.520 --> 12:00.040
[Polytheus] I'll make it

12:00.041 --> 12:01.560
worth your while!

12:01.600 --> 12:03.240
- Polytheus!
- Polytheus!

12:03.280 --> 12:04.760
Who's Polytheus?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.880
He's part snake.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.720
But all slime!

12:07.760 --> 12:10.120
Basically, not to be trusted.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.440
[Polytheus] Ah, at last,

12:14.480 --> 12:16.960
saved by Elves!

12:17.840 --> 12:19.080
OH!

12:19.120 --> 12:21.720
And... A very ornate unicorn.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.000
Help a friend in need?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.160
[Mo sighs]

12:28.480 --> 12:30.520
So what are you doing here...?

12:30.560 --> 12:33.560
Uh... Oh, my chariot?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.360
[Polytheus] I could use

12:35.361 --> 12:37.120
some of your winged wizardry.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.280
Polytheus here!

12:42.320 --> 12:44.760
Best and most trusted merchant

12:44.800 --> 12:46.560
in all of Centopia...

12:46.600 --> 12:47.960
Also the only merchant!

12:50.080 --> 12:51.520
You must be Mia.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.680
How'd you know?

12:52.720 --> 12:54.160
I hear everything.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.560
I'm quite popular.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.280
Yeah, with the snakes!

12:59.160 --> 13:01.880
And who is this fine fellow?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.840
Is he for sale, perchance?

13:03.880 --> 13:06.360
Never! I don't sell my friends.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.200
Are you sure?

13:08.240 --> 13:09.960
- Look out!
- I know some... OH!

13:12.520 --> 13:13.680
[growls]

13:15.160 --> 13:16.400
OH mademoiselle!

13:16.440 --> 13:17.680
You saved my life.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.280
[Mo] Mia, that was amazing!

13:19.320 --> 13:20.440
I just kind of...

13:20.480 --> 13:22.440
acted without thinking!

13:22.480 --> 13:23.680
Hmm... I should try that

13:23.681 --> 13:24.880
in real life sometime!

13:24.920 --> 13:27.880
Ugh, my code of honor binds me

13:27.920 --> 13:30.600
to reward your courageous act.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.000
As much as I hate

13:32.001 --> 13:33.360
to part with this...

13:33.400 --> 13:35.520
my most cherished treasure,

13:35.560 --> 13:36.620
I can give it to you

13:36.621 --> 13:37.680
for half price.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.560
It's okay.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.736
- Besides, I'm sure you
- would've done the same for me.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.640
Erm... yes.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.616
- What are you doing in this neck
- of the woods, anyway?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.600
Oh, [clears throat] I'm...

13:47.640 --> 13:49.780
thinking of setting up

13:49.781 --> 13:51.920
a discount outlet near...

13:51.960 --> 13:53.640
that tree... there...

13:53.680 --> 13:55.080
[clears throat]

13:55.120 --> 13:56.840
Eer... How about you?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.560
- We're looking
- for the Golden Tr...

13:58.600 --> 14:00.560
er, treasure.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.860
It's in some ancient tomb.

14:01.861 --> 14:03.120
But we're kind of lost.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.780
Well... as Centopia's foremost

14:05.781 --> 14:08.400
treasure finder and wholesaler,

14:08.440 --> 14:09.980
who coincidentally

14:09.981 --> 14:11.520
has a map of the area,

14:11.560 --> 14:14.080
I can offer my support.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.200
Actually... we could use a map.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.060
I will accompany you

14:18.061 --> 14:19.880
as your guide and protector.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.500
But you must respect

14:21.501 --> 14:23.080
one condition.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.180
I get to keep

14:24.181 --> 14:25.240
any treasure I find.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.320
Same goes for whatever you find.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.260
You mean we get to keep

14:29.261 --> 14:31.160
whatever we find... right?

14:31.200 --> 14:33.240
Eh... that works too.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.080
Elf huddle!

14:35.120 --> 14:36.840
- Seems like pretty big
- coincidence

14:36.880 --> 14:38.200
Meeting him out here.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.760
True. Then again,

14:39.800 --> 14:41.056
- if anyone
- would know about treasure,

14:41.080 --> 14:42.360
It's Polytheus.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.820
As long as we don't let him

14:45.821 --> 14:47.080
find out about the Trumptus.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.760
- He'd just use it
- to his advantage.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.600
- He seems to actually
- want to help.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.840
Well? Shall we venture forth?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.800
Adventurers who travel together,

14:56.801 --> 14:58.720
profit together!

14:58.760 --> 15:00.200
Careful with him.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.520
He only cares about himself...

15:01.560 --> 15:03.160
and his wallet.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.740
According to the map,

15:08.741 --> 15:09.880
we've arrived.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.720
Now to find the entrance.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.320
- [Mo] We'll spread out
- and search.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.440
- But hurry!
- Onchao is exposed out here.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.200
[neighs]

15:24.160 --> 15:25.200
[sniffs]

15:26.840 --> 15:28.520
- I know this looks like
- a salad bar,

15:28.560 --> 15:30.000
But it isn't snack time!

15:30.040 --> 15:31.560
[neighs]

15:31.600 --> 15:32.840
This way?

15:32.880 --> 15:33.920
Oh!

15:37.640 --> 15:39.520
Guys! Onchao found it!

15:40.480 --> 15:41.800
Excellent!

15:41.840 --> 15:44.600
Elves and children last!

15:44.640 --> 15:45.660
We should keep a lookout

15:45.661 --> 15:46.680
while Mia and Onchao

15:46.720 --> 15:48.640
find the Tru... treasure.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.416
- But should we really
- leave them alone with...

15:50.440 --> 15:52.040
Oh, crushed!

15:52.080 --> 15:53.880
You offend my honor!

15:53.920 --> 15:55.720
She's absolutely safe

15:55.721 --> 15:57.520
in my hands.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.080
All right, but be careful.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.200
We'll be on guard!

16:12.240 --> 16:14.080
[Mia] Wow...

16:14.120 --> 16:16.200
- We should probably
- stick together, since you...

16:16.240 --> 16:17.640
Hey, where'd he go?

16:17.680 --> 16:18.960
[Polytheus] Oh, treasure!

16:19.000 --> 16:20.680
Polytheus is coming!

16:23.280 --> 16:24.480
[neighs]

16:26.520 --> 16:27.800
The other way?

16:27.840 --> 16:29.000
- [neighs]
- Okay!

16:33.840 --> 16:35.960
This place is so cool!

16:39.680 --> 16:41.120
Look, Onchao,

16:41.160 --> 16:42.920
- these must have been
- your ancestors!

16:49.200 --> 16:50.260
What's this?

16:50.261 --> 16:51.320
It almost looks like...

16:51.360 --> 16:53.320
[Polytheus] TREASURE!

16:53.360 --> 16:56.000
It's so... beautiful!

16:56.040 --> 16:57.580
Almost as beautiful as

16:57.581 --> 16:59.120
the gold I'll get for it!

17:00.160 --> 17:01.720
[grunts with effort]

17:01.760 --> 17:03.480
Almost got it...

17:03.520 --> 17:05.000
Mhmm. Yaah!

17:05.040 --> 17:06.359
- [earth tremor]
- Oh dear.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.680
It's kind a cool,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.160
but not a trumptus piece.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.160
- [earth tremor]
- UH!?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.440
What was that?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.520
Oh!

17:16.560 --> 17:17.720
[clanking noise]

17:26.000 --> 17:27.800
We're trapped! Help!

17:27.839 --> 17:29.960
Polytheus?! Help!

17:32.080 --> 17:34.040
- They told me
- I shouldn't trust you!

17:35.400 --> 17:36.840
Okay, plan "B."

17:36.880 --> 17:38.920
Yuko! Mo! Help!

17:38.960 --> 17:40.320
[rumble]

17:43.200 --> 17:45.280
Oh, no! Mia!

17:45.320 --> 17:46.560
[both grunt]

17:48.440 --> 17:49.600
[Mia] Polytheus?

17:49.640 --> 17:51.480
You have to help me!

17:51.520 --> 17:53.020
Oh, I'm sorry,

17:53.021 --> 17:54.520
there just isn't time!

17:54.560 --> 17:55.840
These falling rocks

17:55.841 --> 17:57.120
will damage my statue!

17:57.160 --> 17:59.120
- [Polytheus] Surely
- you understand.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.600
But Polytheus...

18:02.640 --> 18:04.140
you should see

18:04.141 --> 18:05.640
all the treasure in this room!

18:05.680 --> 18:07.300
You wouldn't want to leave

18:07.301 --> 18:08.920
free treasure behind, would you?

18:11.360 --> 18:12.740
But Polytheus, you said

18:12.741 --> 18:14.120
you owed me a favor!

18:14.160 --> 18:16.180
Are you not a man... uh...

18:16.181 --> 18:18.200
creature... of your word?!

18:20.120 --> 18:22.100
But... I... ugh.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.080
I ush... Oh... Grrr.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.440
[Polytheus] Now get out!

18:32.480 --> 18:33.880
You're blocking my way

18:33.920 --> 18:35.640
to those treasures!

18:35.680 --> 18:38.040
Onchao, follow right behind me!

18:38.080 --> 18:39.800
Hurry! [grunts with effort]

18:40.920 --> 18:42.520
There's not enough room!

18:42.560 --> 18:44.640
Can't you lift it any higher?

18:44.680 --> 18:45.960
I can't...

18:45.961 --> 18:47.240
[voiceless] too heavy.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.440
Prop it up with something!

18:48.441 --> 18:49.600
Anything!

18:49.640 --> 18:51.120
What about that?

18:51.160 --> 18:52.520
[pants and breaths deeply]

18:52.560 --> 18:53.800
Grrrrrmmm!

18:57.320 --> 18:58.520
Aagh...

18:58.560 --> 18:59.840
Ahh!

19:03.720 --> 19:05.880
There, I saved your life.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.400
Now get out of my way.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.360
Noooooo!!

19:10.400 --> 19:12.320
- Come on and help me!
- We have to go!

19:12.360 --> 19:14.040
But... my treasure!

19:14.080 --> 19:15.480
If we don't get out of here now,

19:15.520 --> 19:17.160
- we'll all end up
- like your statue!

19:18.400 --> 19:20.040
A little cave quakery

19:20.080 --> 19:22.120
won't keep me from my fortune!

19:23.520 --> 19:25.280
On the other hand,

19:25.320 --> 19:27.520
- a good merchant always knows
- when to cut his losses.

19:29.800 --> 19:30.840
[eart tremor]

19:30.880 --> 19:32.320
[neighs]

19:33.440 --> 19:34.520
Hold on, Mia!

19:34.560 --> 19:35.720
We're gonna get you out!

19:37.520 --> 19:38.680
[gasps]

19:50.360 --> 19:51.680
Are you alright? We worked

19:51.681 --> 19:53.000
as quickly as we could!

19:53.040 --> 19:54.800
I think I'm okay!

19:54.840 --> 19:56.160
[neighs]

19:57.760 --> 19:59.060
[Polytheus] Hello?

19:59.061 --> 20:00.360
Don't worry about me!

20:00.400 --> 20:03.120
I'll just crawl out on my own.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.600
Elf hug!

20:04.601 --> 20:06.040
[laughing]

20:06.080 --> 20:07.720
This whole campaign has been

20:07.721 --> 20:09.360
utterly unprofitable!

20:09.400 --> 20:10.480
Hmmph!

20:10.520 --> 20:11.960
Unless...

20:13.520 --> 20:14.960
Can I have that?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.280
No, you can't have HIM.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.480
So... you didn't find anything?

20:23.880 --> 20:25.296
- [Polytheus] What have you got
- there, miss?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.400
Hey...!

20:26.440 --> 20:28.600
Ooo! What's this?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.760
Bronze, slightly damaged.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.040
Not completely worthless.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.720
And what's this?

20:35.760 --> 20:38.680
A worthless piece of dull metal.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.480
You take that...

20:40.520 --> 20:42.400
This will have to do as payment

20:42.401 --> 20:44.280
for saving not just you,

20:44.320 --> 20:46.520
but Mr. Goldhorn here.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.000
After all, fair's fair.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.640
I can't argue with that.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.760
You really are

20:51.761 --> 20:52.840
an expert merchant!

20:52.880 --> 20:54.720
Well, I must be off.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.600
- Pleasure doing business
- with you.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.520
Yeah. "Anytime."

20:59.560 --> 21:00.680
Tally-ho!

21:13.040 --> 21:14.340
Another piece

21:14.341 --> 21:15.640
of the Golden Trumptus!

21:15.680 --> 21:17.320
Congratulations, Mia.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.480
I understand this was

21:18.481 --> 21:19.600
a hard-won victory.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.840
Thank you, your majesty.

21:20.841 --> 21:22.040
It was!

21:22.080 --> 21:23.280
[neighs]

21:26.960 --> 21:27.980
It would seem someone

21:27.981 --> 21:29.000
wants to go out and play!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.280
Play?! [gasps]

21:30.320 --> 21:31.800
My drama class!

21:31.840 --> 21:33.080
I'd love to stick around,

21:33.120 --> 21:34.640
but I really have to get going!

21:34.680 --> 21:36.760
Bye, everyone!

21:36.800 --> 21:37.920
Bye Onchao.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.200
[neighs]

21:53.440 --> 21:55.360
We'll still be friends, we'll

21:55.361 --> 21:57.280
just be much more than that.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.600
How can you know?!

21:58.640 --> 22:00.160
How can we possibly know?!

22:00.200 --> 22:01.240
There's only one way

22:01.241 --> 22:02.280
to find out.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.160
[school bell rings]

22:14.520 --> 22:15.960
Alright, students,

22:15.961 --> 22:17.400
I'll see you next week,

22:17.440 --> 22:18.840
and we'll be doing

22:18.841 --> 22:20.240
some light musical comedy.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.640
Close call, huh?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.320
Saved by the bell!

22:34.360 --> 22:35.600
Guess my first kiss

22:35.601 --> 22:36.840
will have to wait...

22:36.880 --> 22:38.400
Well, speaking of drama,

22:38.401 --> 22:39.920
have I got a story for you...

22:39.960 --> 22:41.600
- Oh yeah,
- what happened back there?

22:41.640 --> 22:43.136
- You could say it was
- another close call...

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
Not as close

22:44.161 --> 22:45.161
as this one, though!
