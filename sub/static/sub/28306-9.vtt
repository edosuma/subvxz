(sitar music playing)

00:12.080 --> 00:15.116
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.184
[bats squeal]

00:19.787 --> 00:21.289
*

00:23.624 --> 00:26.560
NANDOR:
Our home has been selected

00:26.594 --> 00:28.028
to host

00:28.062 --> 00:31.232
the bi-annual vampire orgy.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
NADJA:
One time they tried
going triannual.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.406
Which is bloody pointless,
'cause it takes me

00:38.439 --> 00:41.442
at least six months
to recover from any orgy.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.710
Yes, it does.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.245
We're gonna have some fun.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.947
NANDOR:
Vampire sex is like pizza,

00:46.980 --> 00:49.417
in that even when
it's bad it's good.

00:49.450 --> 00:53.187
It's designed to be enjoyed
by eight or more people.

00:53.221 --> 00:56.023
There's a choice of toppings.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.725
And in the morning, you're like,

00:57.758 --> 01:00.361
"Aah! Why do I have
puncture wounds

01:00.394 --> 01:02.263
on my penis?"

01:02.296 --> 01:05.099
LASZLO:
Vampire sex is a carnival
of desires.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.935
With pale bodies
as far as the eye can see.

01:07.968 --> 01:11.038
Fornicating, diddling,
widdling, snarling.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.640
An amazing experience

01:12.673 --> 01:14.575
that can last years.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.112
It's fine.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.715
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:21.749 --> 01:24.218
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:24.252 --> 01:26.720
* They have no use
for your song *

01:26.754 --> 01:30.458
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:30.491 --> 01:33.827
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:33.861 --> 01:36.930
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:36.964 --> 01:39.667
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:39.700 --> 01:42.002
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:42.035 --> 01:44.672
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

01:44.705 --> 01:46.374
*

01:54.114 --> 01:56.083
-So we need the blood fountain.
-Okay, blood fountain.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.152
And some real, pure opium.
About ten kilos.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.853
Where would I find that?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.655
LASZLO: We need some
sexy paintings for the walls.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.791
NADJA: I was thinking
we replace this picture of us

02:03.824 --> 02:05.426
with that lovely one
where we were naked

02:05.459 --> 02:07.295
-and we have cherries
in our bums.
-Yeah.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.163
Can we get some sort
of protective spray

02:09.197 --> 02:10.764
to put all over the carpet?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.467
Because Laszlo will spray
all over the carpet.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.270
LASZLO:
What you don't understand is

02:16.304 --> 02:19.673
the stigma attached
to throwing a poor orgy.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.176
I mean, I've known people
who have committed suicide

02:22.210 --> 02:23.977
after a poor orgy.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.313
I wouldn't go that far.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.547
I would kill you, though.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.549
And then I'd kill myself.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.984
There's no recovery
from that humiliation.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.554
I don't like to even speak
of it, but the notorious orgy

02:33.587 --> 02:35.489
-of 1937, well...
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.157
Don't even say the year.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.227
It was a lot of just
very terrible chitchat.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.296
I cannot even speak the name
of the vampire

02:42.330 --> 02:44.298
that organized that monstrosity.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.234
I don't give a fuck.
His name was Mike.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.069
Fucking Mike.
(groans)

02:49.102 --> 02:52.573
Oh, and we need an ancient
Burmese lingam and yoni set.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.974
To be safe, get six.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.509
Nadja, Laszlo, please.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.245
Guillermo is my familiar,

02:57.278 --> 02:58.879
only I can order him about.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.481
Thank you, master.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.882
Is there anything you need?

03:01.915 --> 03:04.485
All the things they just said.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.920
And absorbent towels.
Lots of them.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.089
(gasps)
I almost forgot.

03:09.122 --> 03:12.326
Most important,
we must, must, must

03:12.360 --> 03:14.328
get a succulent virgin feast.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.530
Well, about that--
I've been meaning to tell you,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.099
I seem to have,
uh, overfished that...

03:19.132 --> 03:20.868
-Did you write down the towels?
-Yes.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.536
You need to re-cover
that chaise longue.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.005
'Cause I'll ejaculate
straight through that.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.342
My only concern
about the orgy is, uh,

03:28.376 --> 03:30.244
that people won't enjoy my room.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.780
I've n-I've never
had anyone in here.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.383
I have a strobe light up.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.386
And a couple speakers
playing, uh,

03:38.419 --> 03:39.787
some acid jazz.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.955
What else?
I have my, uh,

03:41.989 --> 03:43.891
my trusty filing cabinet.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.359
I always wanted one of these

03:45.393 --> 03:47.060
when I was a child
but never got one.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.129
It was one of my first
purchases.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.932
I also stocked up
on some Neosporin.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.702
I have some paintings,
some pictures.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.271
I got this one
because it shows human food,

03:57.305 --> 03:59.807
and if I ever
have a human in here,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.642
they'll feel at home.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.611
Uh, I found it at a Holiday Inn.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.146
I-I'm-I'm really
getting into it.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.147
NADJA:
Obviously, the orgy standard

04:07.180 --> 04:09.450
of having a mirrored ceiling

04:09.483 --> 04:12.219
doesn't really work
for vampires,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.988
so we have developed
our own way.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.058
I don't... I... I don't know
what you want me to say.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.760
NANDOR:
Just describe what you see.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.296
GUILLERMO:
Um...

04:22.330 --> 04:25.165
Well, it's a beautiful scene.
Someone is seductively riding,

04:25.198 --> 04:27.301
uh, a candlestick up and down.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.636
Someone's on the couch
sucking and getting sucked.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.903
-NADJA: Louder!
-Sucking and...

04:29.937 --> 04:30.971
Oh, geez...

04:31.004 --> 04:32.973
No. I will not

04:33.006 --> 04:35.275
be participating
in the orgy, no.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.145
Besides, I-I don't, uh,
I don't kiss and tell.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.613
But I can tell you,
(chuckles)

04:39.647 --> 04:41.349
is that, uh...

04:41.382 --> 04:43.684
I don't kiss.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.085
NADJA:
We need specifics.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.420
What am I doing
to my ass cheeks?

04:46.454 --> 04:48.422
You are, uh,
you're licking it...

04:48.456 --> 04:50.658
Can you just describe
what you see? It's not hard.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.027
-Good boy, that's right.
-(groaning)
-Must be my birthday.

04:54.061 --> 04:57.698
-(megaphone alarm chirps)
-I can't. I'm sorry.
I was raised very Catholic.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.700
-I need... I need a second.
-NADJA: Okay.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.435
-En garde, there.
-GUILLERMO: It's just a lot
of demanding things.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.604
I mean, I'm not even,
technically, their familiar.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.373
They've just been asking me
to do all kinds of stuff.

05:05.406 --> 05:08.609
It's a pleasure swing,
you fucknut, not a sex net.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.711
That's the sex net.
Get that out of the box

05:10.744 --> 05:12.946
-and attach it to the ceiling.
-GUILLERMO: "Gizmo,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.348
get the dildos."

05:14.382 --> 05:16.384
"Gizmo, try out the dildos."

05:16.417 --> 05:18.419
"Mmm. How were the dildos?"

05:19.553 --> 05:21.455
They're fine.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.990
No one is a fucknut, okay?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.625
He's trying to finish it,
Laszlo.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.460
And what about the virgins?
Have you got any yet? No.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.396
-Of course you haven't.
-Um, but I'm just trying...

05:28.429 --> 05:30.998
"But, but, but." You're like
a nonstop but machine. (gasps)

05:31.031 --> 05:32.500
That reminds me,
have you ordered

05:32.533 --> 05:34.368
-the nonstop butt machine?
-You know what?!

05:34.402 --> 05:35.869
I'm gonna take five minutes

05:35.903 --> 05:37.237
before I say something
I'm gonna regret.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.640
-Oh!
-Easy there.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.143
Eh... Slam the door.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.812
You gonna let him
get away with that?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.814
He's gone,
he's gotten away with it.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.048
And it is unacceptable.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.718
(exhales)
I will talk to him.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.654
-*
-(knocking on door)

05:53.687 --> 05:56.156
-NANDOR: Knock, knock.
-Oh. Good evening, master.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.825
-Is there something you need?
-No, no.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.193
Just coming in for a chat.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.029
-(exhales)
-(grunts)

06:03.431 --> 06:05.399
I noticed that Nadja and Laszlo

06:05.433 --> 06:08.101
have been quite pushy with you
with all the orgy planning.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.439
-Oh, it's okay,
it's not a big deal, master.
-No, it is a big deal.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.474
And they locked you
in this closet?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.244
This is my room.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.413
I pay $1,200 a month.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.948
Oh.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.183
If I find I am in a situation

06:23.216 --> 06:26.954
where an idiot
is complaining to me,

06:26.987 --> 06:29.389
you can either kill them

06:29.423 --> 06:32.526
or you can pretend
to listening to them.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.562
So what you're saying is that

06:34.595 --> 06:37.130
your feelings have been hurt.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.866
Well, kinda.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.101
Talk about that.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.604
Oh, okay. Um... Well,

06:43.637 --> 06:45.439
-I just feel that sometimes...
-Yes, yes.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.274
I feel that I have...
People aren't listening to me

06:47.307 --> 06:49.242
-when I speak.
-Yes, yes, tell me more.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.311
And they just tell me "yes,"
and they don't really listen

06:51.344 --> 06:53.313
-to what I'm saying.
-Yes. Really speak
from the heart.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.382
When I speak from the heart,
I feel like no one's really...

06:55.415 --> 06:57.150
And now that bit is done.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.493
Orgy stuff. A few of my
favorite things, as they say.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.728
The cat o' nine tails.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.262
Oliver Cromwell's head.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.965
My codpiece.
Bat codpiece.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.067
200-year-old peekaboo cape,

07:14.101 --> 07:16.136
the idea being
you walk into the orgy,

07:16.169 --> 07:18.739
you announce yourself...

07:18.772 --> 07:20.641
and then do that.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.175
Oh!

07:22.209 --> 07:23.577
Oh, yes!

07:23.611 --> 07:26.580
You wait till my good lady wife
sees this.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.949
In the late 1800s,

07:28.982 --> 07:31.485
a new and exciting medium
was invented,

07:31.519 --> 07:33.320
and that medium
was called "cinema."

07:33.353 --> 07:35.422
And then, about a week later,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.157
that developed into pornos.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.861
Now, the first porno film
I ever made

07:40.894 --> 07:43.864
was called The Adventures
of a Very Randy Vampire.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.933
And I played the leading role

07:45.966 --> 07:49.269
of the very randy vampire.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.838
I was cast
because they thought

07:50.871 --> 07:53.140
that I looked like a vampire,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.375
never once realizing

07:55.408 --> 07:56.777
that I was a fucking vampire.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.779
I took part in thousands

07:58.812 --> 08:00.147
of pornos over the years.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.882
If you see them now,

08:01.915 --> 08:05.385
they are still
very, very erotic.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.387
(old-timey piano music playing)

08:07.420 --> 08:09.790
My darling,
I have found something

08:09.823 --> 08:13.727
that will have our orgy
talked about for centuries.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.329
Just put it on the pile, Laszlo.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.131
All right there, Constantin?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.499
(growls softly)

08:21.401 --> 08:23.370
Ooh.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.072
-Oops.
-What is that?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.741
I really have no idea.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.877
Perhaps we should watch it.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.379
(groans)

08:32.412 --> 08:33.814
You don't like
the Christmas section?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.650
-(groans) Don't say that word.
-Sorry.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.485
GUILLERMO:
We are still looking
for virgins, yes,

08:38.518 --> 08:41.889
but my master thought it'd be
best to get decorations first,

08:41.922 --> 08:44.357
which makes sense,
because, uh...

08:47.227 --> 08:49.262
Well, it just...
It makes sense.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.864
So, for this chocolate fountain,

08:50.898 --> 08:52.833
you can put other stuff,
I'm assuming...

08:52.866 --> 08:54.668
-I mean...
-...that's thicker
than chocolate?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.737
What's thicker than chocolate?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.538
Did you ask
about the jade buttock eggs?

08:58.572 --> 08:59.707
No, I did not.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.441
-Butter cakes?
-Buttock eggs

09:01.474 --> 09:04.111
made from jade
that you put inside your butt.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.545
I don't think they have them.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.214
I'd have to check on that,
for sure.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.849
-They don't have to be made
of jade.
-I haven't seen it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.951
They can be made of anything.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.219
But not silver,

09:12.252 --> 09:14.755
because, you know,
otherwise, ouch.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.725
-He's joking.
-There's a silver egg
in my butt.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.126
Did you carry them?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.561
We do mostly, like,
loot bags for kids.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.763
I don't think-I don't think
they have them.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.702
I'm very happy that my master's
gonna help me find a virgin,

09:28.736 --> 09:30.537
'cause it is slim pickings

09:30.570 --> 09:33.073
out here in these streets.
(chuckles)

09:33.106 --> 09:36.744
The Christian college chastity
club seemed promising until

09:36.777 --> 09:38.411
I found out
that most of them had a...

09:38.445 --> 09:42.315
different definition of "virgin"
than the common one.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.753
Believe it or not, CrossFit
gyms are full of virgins.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.755
No one's touched them,
and the reason being

09:47.788 --> 09:51.391
is because they won't shut up
about CrossFit.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.993
If you saw a man

09:53.026 --> 09:54.427
dressed in this mask,

09:54.461 --> 09:56.630
would you think
it was a mood killer

09:56.664 --> 09:58.766
or would you come?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.468
I'm not sure.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.469
(inhales)

10:02.502 --> 10:03.971
Wait, wait, wait.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.740
Look at that man, Guillermo.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.441
(exhales)

10:08.475 --> 10:11.244
He looks delicious.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.180
He has to be a virgin.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.514
I don't think he's a virgin.
We should just probably

10:14.547 --> 10:15.783
-keep shopping...
-He is a virgin.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.117
Guillermo!

10:17.150 --> 10:19.319
-Hey! Jeremy!
-(chuckles)

10:19.352 --> 10:21.789
-Is that...
I thought it was you.
-It was me, yeah.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.757
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)
Where have you been lately?

10:23.791 --> 10:26.159
We've been having some
hella crazy Fortnite sessions.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.461
Hasn't been as fun
without old GuillermoGoth2000.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.698
-Oh, shit. No, my...
(clears throat)
-Did you-did you change

10:30.731 --> 10:32.866
-your gamertag? You can tell me.
-No, no.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.702
-Work stuff. It's...
My boss just keeps,
-I'm so sorry.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.536
-you know, riding me.
-Uh-huh.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.171
-You know, it was good talking
to you though.
-Yeah.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.272
So, take care.
I'll see you, okay?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.440
You having a party or something?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.441
No.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.442
Yes.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.277
Yes, we are having a party,

10:44.311 --> 10:47.781
and we'd very much love
to extend an invitation.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.350
No, I don't think
Jeremy and his girlfriend

10:50.383 --> 10:53.020
would, uh, want to come
to a lame party.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.054
-It's just...
-I don't...

10:54.087 --> 10:55.122
I don't have a girlfriend.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.289
Yeah, you do.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.290
Oh, you're...

10:57.324 --> 10:59.126
-Yeah.
-No, that was a catfish.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.795
Jeremy is definitely a virgin.
I mean, big-time.

11:01.829 --> 11:04.965
But, um... he's also my friend.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.566
-Yeah.
-There was a girl though, right?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.001
-Oh. Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.236
Oh, I just started seeing
this woman.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.237
-There you go.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

11:10.270 --> 11:11.638
Yeah, I thought so.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.140
-So...
-It's for my nosebleeds.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.342
-Geez, Jeremy. God.
-It's not going well. (chuckles)

11:15.375 --> 11:17.845
But, you know, once I
finally have that under control,

11:17.878 --> 11:20.080
-maybe I'll finally
meet someone.
-Ah. (chuckles)

11:20.113 --> 11:22.215
-(laughs, groans)
-Oh, boy.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.683
-(groans)
-Oh, boy.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.553
Okay. Oops.
(chuckles)

11:26.586 --> 11:28.221
-Yeah, that's a nosebleed.
(chuckles)
-Yeah.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.823
Just gonna go find
some more tissues,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.025
'cause this one's gonna be full
any second. (laughs)

11:32.059 --> 11:33.526
-Just go. Just get out of here.
-Yeah, okay.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.694
Nice to meet you. Hey.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.897
-Just go, Jeremy. Just go.
-Yeah, okay.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.733
(exhales, sniffing)

11:39.767 --> 11:41.935
-(grunts)
-GUILLERMO:
You know, I like to keep

11:41.969 --> 11:44.037
my personal life
and my work life separate.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.438
I don't want them to cross over.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.940
Makes it easier
when you find someone

11:46.974 --> 11:48.742
that you're gonna sacri...

11:50.277 --> 11:51.745
Yeah.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.246
NANDOR:
Mmm.

11:53.280 --> 11:57.250
(sighs) That is some of the most
virginal blood I've ever tasted.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.253
(sniffs, exhales)

12:00.287 --> 12:02.890
We must have him.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.793
GUILLERMO:
It's gonna be a tough one.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.227
(upbeat piano music playing)

12:07.260 --> 12:09.396
There's a man
who enjoys his work.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.364
This was banned for 60 years.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.133
*

12:13.166 --> 12:15.368
-FLAPPER: Zounds! I'm indecent!
-(grunting)

12:15.402 --> 12:17.437
LASZLO:
Time to 23 skidoo.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.707
Or should I say "69 skidoo"?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.276
DOMINATRIX: Let's see State
College win their big game

12:23.310 --> 12:25.478
without their star quarterback.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.414
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

12:27.447 --> 12:29.416
DOMINATRIX:
How can I ever
make it up to you?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.051
-(big band music playing)
-(dominatrix moaning)
-LASZLO: Oh, yeah.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.619
Be-Bop-A-Lube-a, yeah.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.055
I'm about to launch a Sputnik.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.824
NADJA:
There is nothing
more devastating

12:36.857 --> 12:39.559
than finding out
your husband has made porn

12:39.592 --> 12:41.461
and it's so bloody boring.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.830
(whirring)

12:42.863 --> 12:44.898
MAN:
So, how old are you?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.100
-267.
-(chuckles)

12:47.134 --> 12:48.101
I joke.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.769
I'm 18.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.672
Have you ever been
with a man before?

12:52.705 --> 12:56.009
And how would you like me
to answer that, Philip?

12:56.043 --> 12:57.144
No.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.412
You'll never guess
where this is going.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.481
Then the answer's no.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.416
-(funky music playing)
-(Laszlo grunting)

13:03.450 --> 13:05.518
NADJA:
The only thing those videos
were good for

13:05.552 --> 13:07.955
was for putting crying babies
to sleep.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.757
-(slap bass theme playing)
-And now the 1990s.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.460
Could it be any sexier?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.296
Where have you been?
I paged you over an hour ago.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.466
Who are these people
who are always paging?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.168
And what's the deal
with pagers?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.335
BLONDE:
Shut up and get over here.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.137
LASZLO:
Mm. Yep.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.940
This is exactly what I want
to be doing right now.

13:26.974 --> 13:30.277
Laszlo, darling,
I just think your work,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.312
as stimulating as it is,

13:32.345 --> 13:35.348
it is not quite right
for our orgy.

13:35.382 --> 13:38.551
It-It's like erotica
for churchgoers.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.653
Even Vampire Tricked
in Steam Room?

13:40.687 --> 13:41.889
That one didn't even make
any sense.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.057
I mean, how could we see
what you were doing

13:44.091 --> 13:45.492
but you couldn't?

13:45.525 --> 13:47.394
No, no, no, no. You've
misunderstood it, my darling.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.396
What happens in that is
I'm sat there,

13:49.429 --> 13:51.664
surrounded, I think,
by women.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.400
The steam subsides,

13:53.433 --> 13:57.004
and I realize I'm
actually surrounded by chaps.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.671
But I enjoy it.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.073
Well, I got that bit.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.841
I just think...

14:01.875 --> 14:03.410
it's boring.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.178
Boring?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.080
*

14:07.114 --> 14:09.016
You think it's all boring?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.552
I shall be in our bedchamber.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.387
Oh, Laszlo.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.555
No, no.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.390
She said
that my pornos were boring,

14:17.424 --> 14:19.226
which is
an unbelievable reaction.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.827
I showed her a century's worth

14:20.860 --> 14:22.062
of my pornos.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.164
That's a lot of porn.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.899
I don't think
she followed the plots.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.167
(phone beeps)

14:27.200 --> 14:29.836
Hey, Jeremy.
Sorry I'm calling you so late.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.071
Jeremy and I go way back.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.041
We've been friends,
um, since high school.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.175
What are you doing tonight?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.609
We were really just attached

14:36.643 --> 14:38.378
at the hip. Not by choice,

14:38.411 --> 14:42.582
but because they would
literally, um, use hot glue.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.452
I invited Jeremy to the party.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.921
No, just yourself.

14:47.955 --> 14:51.624
Oh, I think they got
all the drinks covered.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.026
Yeah, I feel bad.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.527
You know what,
I'm doing whatever it takes

14:54.561 --> 14:56.563
to become a vampire.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.566
MAN:
Oh. Sorry.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.602
Somebody told me
this was a closet.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.309
It's going to be
an amazing orgy.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.611
Over here, we have a sculpture
which depicts

15:11.644 --> 15:14.081
the moment
that my parents conceived me.

15:14.114 --> 15:17.050
In here, we have
the fluffers' chill-out area.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.387
Here we have the traditional
animal fur laden with rings.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.821
Not for your fingers.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.290
Electric chair role-play.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.158
"What are your last words?"

15:25.192 --> 15:26.960
"I want to have sex."

15:26.994 --> 15:30.230
-Laszlo, what is going on?
-I'm not coming.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.664
What are you doing?
What is this?

15:31.698 --> 15:33.967
Are you role-playing
as a depressed man?

15:34.001 --> 15:35.668
It's not not working.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.936
I'm not coming to the orgy.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.471
-I'm not in the mood.
-What?

15:38.505 --> 15:40.673
Is this because I said
your porno was terrible?

15:40.707 --> 15:41.941
The pornos were superb.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.944
Have you any idea how difficult
it is to make a porno?

15:44.978 --> 15:47.414
Laszlo, do you want our orgy
to fall apart

15:47.447 --> 15:50.650
and for our good vampire names
to go down in history

15:50.683 --> 15:53.486
with he whose name
that we never say the name of?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.088
-You mean Mike?
-Yes, fucking Mike!

15:55.122 --> 15:56.656
To be honest with you,
I couldn't care less.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.592
-Good night.
-Laszlo, don't you dare
go back in there.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.893
No, I'm not coming.
Let go of the lid.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.766
Yes, I suppose
I am a little bit stressed.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.101
(shouts)

16:08.135 --> 16:09.936
To throw a bad vampire orgy,

16:09.969 --> 16:11.804
I don't know
how one would recover.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.374
Half the bats you see,
they are just vampires

16:14.407 --> 16:16.109
that have thrown
terrible orgies,

16:16.143 --> 16:17.210
and they are too ashamed

16:17.244 --> 16:19.112
to regain their vampire form.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.282
They just flit around.
Shame bats.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.450
Bats full of shame.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.517
And you know them,

16:24.551 --> 16:26.686
'cause they don't fly as high.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.023
(indistinct chatter)

16:30.057 --> 16:33.460
-Jiang Shi!
-Nadja!

16:33.493 --> 16:35.128
-Chinese jumping vampire.
-(Jiang Shi chuckles)

16:35.162 --> 16:37.397
(playful growling)

16:37.430 --> 16:39.566
(both laugh)

16:39.599 --> 16:41.068
-Brought my cousin.
-Is he a Babadook?

16:41.101 --> 16:43.336
No, actually, I'm a Badabook.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.472
You know, like, uh,
bada-bing, Badabook.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.006
-Hey-oh! Ah!
-(Nadja chuckles)

16:47.040 --> 16:48.308
(indistinct chatter)

16:48.341 --> 16:50.343
(growls)

16:51.444 --> 16:53.246
And I don't believe
for one minute

16:53.280 --> 16:56.216
that the raccoon actually solved
the Rubik's Cube

16:56.249 --> 17:00.153
that it was given in the video
because there are clearly cuts

17:00.187 --> 17:02.589
in the video,
but it was darling.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.690
-VAMPIRE: Such a doll.
-VAMPIRE 2: Really?

17:03.723 --> 17:04.824
VAMPIRE 1:
Yeah.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.892
-No, not when I...
-Sorry.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.760
Um, and, uh, who are you?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.996
Oh. Uh, hi. I'm Jeremy.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.232
I brought mochi ice cream.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.702
Is there a place
that I can put my backpack?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.771
Everyone, the virgin is here!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.207
-(laughs)
-(vampires cheer)

17:22.242 --> 17:24.077
Jeremy's here. He just got here,

17:24.111 --> 17:26.079
and, uh, all the vampires' eyes
just lit up

17:26.113 --> 17:27.247
when he came in.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.216
(vampires hissing)

17:29.249 --> 17:30.917
I think I did a good job
as a familiar.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.420
Yeah.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.922
Maybe not so much as a friend.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.190
-Guillermo, hey.
-(hissing continues)

17:37.224 --> 17:38.591
This is a great party.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.193
Everyone's really friendly. Hi.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.595
-Yeah, what did you bring?
-I brought mochi.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.264
I thought maybe people
would eat that.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.466
-Yeah. Yeah.
-(Jeremy chuckles)

17:47.467 --> 17:49.736
They're gonna tear him apart.

17:56.943 --> 17:57.944
I'm here!

17:59.146 --> 18:02.749
The life of the orgy
has arrived.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.318
Bit stiff.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.086
I've done a bad thing.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.788
I just brought my friend
to a house full of vampires.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.090
I brought my virgin friend
into a house full of vampires.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.160
Is it hot in here? (chuckles)

18:13.193 --> 18:14.394
-MR. '50s: Hey.
-(gasps)

18:14.427 --> 18:16.496
Mr. '50s, you made it.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.731
Yeesh.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.167
Well, you could argue,
though, that all you need

18:20.200 --> 18:21.634
-is a cell phone.
-(bullhorn turns on)

18:21.668 --> 18:23.936
Listen. Listen, stop talking.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.106
-Oh, no.
-Listen, my name is Laszlo,

18:27.140 --> 18:30.343
and I was not going to come
to this orgy this evening

18:30.377 --> 18:32.812
-because my heart was in pain.
-VAMPIRE: Who cares?

18:32.845 --> 18:35.482
VAMPIRE 2:
Yes! Vampire Tricked
in Steam Room!

18:35.515 --> 18:36.749
Yes, it is me.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.351
-(vampire 2 whoops)
-(mouthing)
-Anyway,

18:38.385 --> 18:41.254
I put my heavy heart to one side

18:41.288 --> 18:44.957
for the love
of my good lady wife Nadja.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.093
-VAMPIRE 3: Ugh.
-Recently,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.696
I was watching all
of my porno films,

18:49.729 --> 18:53.266
which are sexy and a turn-on.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.468
But they lack one thing
and one important thing.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.104
-And that one thing is love.
-(mouthing)

18:58.137 --> 18:59.539
-(vampires groaning)
-The love I share

18:59.572 --> 19:02.175
for my good lady wife Nadja.

19:02.209 --> 19:05.478
What say we conduct
our own orgy upstairs?

19:05.512 --> 19:08.348
-A two-person orgy.
-VAMPIRE 4: What?

19:08.381 --> 19:11.518
Here's to love and making love!

19:11.551 --> 19:12.652
What a boner killer.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.521
And I thought
Mike threw a bad orgy.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.456
-VAMPIRE 5:
I think I'm going to take off.
-NADJA: N-No, no.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.226
Wait, wait. No, wait, everyone.
No, no, wait!

19:19.259 --> 19:21.361
'Cause we haven't had
the best part yet.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.495
(whispering):
I did a terrible thing.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.464
I just killed my friend.
Oh, God.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.732
I brought my v-virgin friend

19:25.765 --> 19:27.467
into a house full of vampires.
(gasps)

19:27.500 --> 19:28.868
Oh, God,
they're gonna rip him apart.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.239
Guess what.
There is the most gorgeous...

19:32.272 --> 19:34.173
I got to help him.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.043
...nosebleedy, asthma-suffering,

19:37.076 --> 19:39.212
-uh, doesn't clean his sheets...
-Jeremy!

19:39.246 --> 19:42.582
...mouth-breathing virgin!

19:42.615 --> 19:44.884
-(both panting)
-(vampires groan)

19:44.917 --> 19:46.152
GUILLERMO:
Jeremy, you have to leave.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.520
-They're all vamp...
-JEREMY: Guillermo.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.922
This party's awesome!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.090
I, uh, I...

19:51.123 --> 19:54.126
Is this the way out?

19:59.131 --> 20:01.334
Well...

20:01.368 --> 20:05.171
looks like, uh,
Jeremy's not a virgin anymore.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.274
-(Constantin grunting)
-(indistinct chatter)

20:08.541 --> 20:10.377
So, sorry about that, gang.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.245
This orgy didn't count.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.348
Don't tell your friends
it was a bad orgy.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.284
COLIN:
So, uh...

20:17.317 --> 20:19.386
just us three, then?

20:27.427 --> 20:28.861
(Jeremy chuckles)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.897
Okay, these are both good.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.570
I'm just going to check up
on Laszlo.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.205
Poor guy.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.875
I don't think Nadja will let him
forget about this one.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.911
-Laszlo.
-(knocks on door)

20:46.913 --> 20:48.915
