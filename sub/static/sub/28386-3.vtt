- "Creative side."

38:07.272 --> 38:09.706
- As in...
- I think I want

38:09.741 --> 38:11.742

some people would say,

38:18.316 --> 38:20.317
"Go work under some big designer."

38:20.351 --> 38:22.619

you make something,

38:22.654 --> 38:24.388
and you make sure that it's good,

38:24.422 --> 38:26.223

you keep crushing it at
this job and maintaining
