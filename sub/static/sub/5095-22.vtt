09:31.577 --> 09:34.379
What am I
supposed to do?

09:34.381 --> 09:37.947
Every kid on that block makes
twice in a month what Curtis

09:37.949 --> 09:40.210
makes in a year
here at the hospital.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.947
How am I supposed
to keep my boy from that?

09:42.949 --> 09:44.921
I understand.

09:44.923 --> 09:47.121
He's your boy.

09:48.091 --> 09:50.288
You know...

09:52.361 --> 09:55.159
I've been in
here more times

09:55.161 --> 09:57.232
than I care to count.

09:57.234 --> 09:58.633
With wives

09:58.635 --> 10:00.634
and mothers of cops

10:00.636 --> 10:03.837
clinging to life.

10:03.839 --> 10:06.446
It's a sacred place for me.

10:10.016 --> 10:12.151
But I've never
been in here for this.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.415
For what?

10:13.417 --> 10:16.086
For a woman trying to hide
the whereabouts

10:16.088 --> 10:18.022
of a suspected killer.

10:18.024 --> 10:20.558
He's my son.
And Linda

10:20.560 --> 10:22.029
is my daughter-in-law.

10:22.031 --> 10:25.229
And the dead man
was my witness.

10:25.231 --> 10:27.133
And I do not have the time

10:27.135 --> 10:29.334
or the inclination

10:29.336 --> 10:32.778
to pray for support
and guidance for you.

10:34.277 --> 10:36.442
So I'm calling you out.

10:39.081 --> 10:41.984
In here.

10:41.986 --> 10:45.121
Where the hell's your boy?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.834
Got eyes on the target?

10:55.836 --> 10:57.401
Negative.

10:57.403 --> 10:58.801
Said he was supposed to be here.

10:58.803 --> 11:01.336
His mom said she bought him
a bus ticket to Tampa.

11:01.338 --> 11:02.367
He's got no money,

11:02.369 --> 11:04.305
no cab fare,
so the subway stop's

11:04.307 --> 11:06.841
the only way to get
to the bus depot.

11:07.915 --> 11:08.880
Are you kidding me?

11:08.882 --> 11:11.111
Get out of the way.

11:12.216 --> 11:15.848
Come on, Curtis. Where are you,
you son of a bitch?

11:25.037 --> 11:27.478
I can't find him.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.219
I think I just spotted her.

11:34.221 --> 11:36.089
Where? Where is he?
No, I mean “her.”

11:36.091 --> 11:38.090
Hey, Curtis!

11:43.997 --> 11:46.004
(grunts)
(shouts)

11:47.006 --> 11:48.299
(horn honking)

11:48.301 --> 11:50.940
(grunting)
Come here.

11:50.942 --> 11:52.141
Get on the ground.

11:52.143 --> 11:54.012
Back up! Back up!

11:54.014 --> 11:55.509
You shoot my wife?!
Back up.

11:55.511 --> 11:56.709
Get back.

11:56.711 --> 11:58.981
Son of a bitch.

11:58.983 --> 12:01.285
Back up, everybody!
Back up. Police!

12:01.287 --> 12:02.549
What are you looking at?!

12:02.551 --> 12:04.652
Hey! Turn that off!

12:08.847 --> 12:12.077
Remember to behave,
Detective.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.284
(door closes)

12:28.830 --> 12:31.859
Left something of yours
at the hospital, Curtis.

12:31.861 --> 12:34.500
Thought you might want it back.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.466
It's a slug.

12:38.468 --> 12:41.474
Doctors pulled it out
of my wife.

12:41.476 --> 12:43.474
There's still another one
in her, you know,

12:43.476 --> 12:46.410
but they can't pull that one out
'cause it might kill her.

12:46.412 --> 12:48.241
I'm sorry.

12:48.243 --> 12:50.746
Shut your face.

12:50.748 --> 12:52.186
This is Assistant
District Attorney

12:52.188 --> 12:53.483
Erin Reagan.

12:53.485 --> 12:54.882
You know why
she's here?

12:54.884 --> 12:56.290
No.

12:56.292 --> 12:57.955
To keep me from snapping
your neck.

12:57.957 --> 12:59.892
Detective.

12:59.894 --> 13:02.365
She thinks I'm unstable.

13:02.367 --> 13:05.469
A lot of people do around here.

13:05.471 --> 13:08.239
Although they thought that
<i>before</i>

13:08.241 --> 13:10.672
you shot the mother of my kids.

13:16.817 --> 13:19.045
Are these...

13:22.120 --> 13:23.823
Are these your kids?
No.

13:23.825 --> 13:26.559
My kids are lucky.
Their dad's still alive.

13:26.561 --> 13:29.128
Those are Hector Florez's kids.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.192
You killed their dad.

13:32.898 --> 13:34.200
Facing the
consequences

13:34.202 --> 13:35.736
for pulling
the trigger, well,

13:35.738 --> 13:38.473
not so much, huh?

13:38.475 --> 13:39.769
You think I wanted to kill him?

13:39.771 --> 13:41.042
I think you're a punk

13:41.044 --> 13:42.738
who wanted to
earn his stripes

13:42.740 --> 13:44.810
with the Warrior Kings,
so you did something as stupid

13:44.812 --> 13:46.545
as what you did.

13:47.411 --> 13:48.817
But I think you're smart enough
to know

13:48.819 --> 13:52.080
where that's gonna land you,
aren't you?

13:52.082 --> 13:55.486
Who ordered the hit
on Hector Florez?

13:56.623 --> 13:59.516
Hey. I said
who ordered the hit?!

13:59.518 --> 14:00.420
Detective.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.819
Answer me!
Hey!

14:01.821 --> 14:03.290
Knock it off!
You know what, put the wig

14:03.292 --> 14:04.890
back on-- you're
gonna need it Detective.

14:04.892 --> 14:06.762
'cause you're gonna be
someone's bitch in the joint!

14:06.764 --> 14:08.962
Detective, now!

14:11.365 --> 14:13.803
You gonna be Mario
Hunt's bitch, huh?

14:13.805 --> 14:16.101
Is that who
ordered the hit?

14:16.103 --> 14:17.405
Curtis, you have
no priors.

14:17.407 --> 14:19.509
You've never been in the system.

14:19.511 --> 14:21.910
You tell Detective Reagan
who ordered the hit,

14:21.912 --> 14:23.215
and I can help you.

14:23.217 --> 14:24.951
DANNY: You know, you should
listen to her.

14:24.953 --> 14:26.416
She's about the only thing
saving you

14:26.418 --> 14:28.889
from me ripping your eyeballs
out right now.

14:28.891 --> 14:31.155
ERIN: My office is willing to
make you a very nice offer

14:31.157 --> 14:32.930
in exchange for
your cooperation

14:32.932 --> 14:36.958
in this investigation,
and I can personally guarantee

14:36.960 --> 14:39.725
that we can cut your
jail time in half.

14:39.727 --> 14:41.133
You think I'm afraid of jail?

14:41.135 --> 14:43.102
I do.
Yeah, I'm not.

14:43.104 --> 14:44.102
I ain't afraid

14:44.104 --> 14:46.164
of jail, a'right?
You will be.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.636
Curtis, think
of your mother.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.972
That is who I'm thinking about.

14:49.974 --> 14:52.603
Your mother?

14:52.605 --> 14:55.471
Did they threaten your mother?

14:57.302 --> 15:00.035
Is that what this is about?

15:04.580 --> 15:09.115
Did they threaten to hurt her
if you talked?

15:10.653 --> 15:12.619
Curtis?

15:18.996 --> 15:20.858
GARRETT:
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What?</i>

15:20.860 --> 15:22.930
GORMLEY: They call him
Ice, you know?

15:22.932 --> 15:24.697
AKA Ice.
GARRETT: Who?

15:24.699 --> 15:26.799
The Warrior King leader,
Clinton Wallace.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.599
He has 'em all brainwashed.

15:28.601 --> 15:30.063
The ones that don't
believe he's God

15:30.065 --> 15:31.869
are convinced he's the
devil. Either case,

15:31.871 --> 15:33.100
we can't break 'em.

15:33.102 --> 15:34.729
You can't
break the ice?

15:34.731 --> 15:36.529
GORMLEY: Ha, ha, ha.
No, we can't.

15:36.531 --> 15:38.371
Chief Kent couldn't
either, try as he might.

15:38.373 --> 15:40.107
GARRETT: Everyone and everything
has a breaking point.

15:40.109 --> 15:42.244
If you know where it is,
and nobody does

15:42.246 --> 15:43.035
with these guys.

15:43.059 --> 15:44.613
It's there, Sid.
We're just not seeing it yet.

15:44.614 --> 15:47.884
What's to see? A guy puts
a gun to my mother's head,

15:47.886 --> 15:51.388
tells me to shut up, I dummy
up-- I'm impossible to break.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.157
Then you come at him
with something bigger,

15:53.159 --> 15:55.357
something scarier.

15:55.359 --> 15:57.622
Scarier than threatening to kill
your mother? What's that?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.926
GARRETT: I don't know.
Well, there you go. We got nothing.

16:00.928 --> 16:03.258
Face it, Garrett. We're out
of options. I hate to say it,

16:03.260 --> 16:06.529
but the best we can do is
threaten some more jail time

16:06.531 --> 16:09.201
for a guy who already has
two life sentences

16:09.203 --> 16:11.032
and got Rikers set
up like his own

16:11.034 --> 16:12.702
casa amigos.

16:12.704 --> 16:14.238
And then there's this.

16:15.737 --> 16:17.742
The hell's that?
What Ice Wallace

16:17.744 --> 16:20.206
does to his soldiers
when they step out of line.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.845
Cuts their tongue out.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.676
Geez.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.339
He read a lot.

16:26.644 --> 16:28.313
Chief Kent?
Yeah, and not

16:28.315 --> 16:29.977
like beach or airport reads.

16:29.979 --> 16:32.786
Really old, obscure stuff.

16:32.788 --> 16:35.322
He'd kind of go off-road
with it, I thought.

16:35.324 --> 16:36.324
How's that?

16:36.325 --> 16:38.155
We'll, you'd be
at a barbecue

16:38.157 --> 16:40.862
talking Mets or whatever,
and he'd change the subject

16:40.864 --> 16:42.166
to some book he was reading.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.768
And you wouldn't know
where he was going with it,

16:44.770 --> 16:46.169
and then
he'd bring it

16:46.171 --> 16:48.675
back home,
to police work, to strategy.

16:48.677 --> 16:50.307
Very smart guy.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.517
I'm kind of wondering
where this is going.

16:53.519 --> 16:55.582
Arthashastra.
It's an ancient text

16:55.584 --> 16:57.655
from an Indian philosopher,

16:57.657 --> 17:00.455
K-Kautilya.

17:00.457 --> 17:01.894
That's a mouthful.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.590
Not to Don.

17:03.592 --> 17:04.829
What's in it?

17:04.832 --> 17:08.196
Well, if I remember right,
it was an idea

17:08.199 --> 17:11.162
that he would get
pretty worked up about.

17:11.164 --> 17:15.431
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.998
(siren wailing)

17:23.040 --> 17:25.638
I'm here on the express
orders of the commissioner.

17:25.641 --> 17:27.742
I don't give a damn
what she told him.

17:27.744 --> 17:29.342
I was an altar boy with Curtis.

17:29.344 --> 17:30.814
He doesn't have a scratch
on him.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.047
That happens
to be exactly what I told him.

17:33.049 --> 17:34.847
I'm not here about that.
Then what?

17:34.849 --> 17:37.256
Artie Shasta.
Or something like that.

17:37.258 --> 17:39.761
Arthashastra.
It's an ancient text.

17:39.763 --> 17:41.561
Well, I don't speak
ancient texts.

17:41.563 --> 17:43.562
Never mind.
It's a long story. Just...

17:43.564 --> 17:47.266
Point is, we got a new target.

17:47.268 --> 17:49.467
We're going after Victor Perez?
He has an outstanding warrant

17:49.469 --> 17:52.106
for non-appearance
from last May.

17:52.108 --> 17:53.339
He's not a Warrior King.
He's from

17:53.341 --> 17:54.610
their rivals,
the Ace Double Treys.

17:54.612 --> 17:56.777
They run out of Jamie's precinct.
The enemy

17:56.779 --> 17:59.441
of my enemy is my friend.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.616
We can't
break the Kings,

18:03.618 --> 18:06.351
but if we put enough pressure
on their rivals...

18:06.353 --> 18:09.121
We won't have to. They'll do it for us.
Bring him in.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.658
Turn up the heat, but...

18:10.660 --> 18:12.562
I know.
Do it the way Chief Kent would.

18:12.564 --> 18:15.256
I got the memo.

18:15.258 --> 18:17.031
(indistinct chatter)
MAN: Let's go!

18:17.033 --> 18:22.031
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, seven! Seven-11, baby!

18:22.033 --> 18:23.702
(indistinct chattering)

18:24.503 --> 18:26.532
Come on, seven!

18:26.534 --> 18:28.939
Oh!
(others exclaiming)

18:28.941 --> 18:32.004
(indistinct shouting)

18:32.006 --> 18:33.940
Back up!
Who's next?

18:33.942 --> 18:35.980
Who else want to lose
some money? Step up!

18:35.982 --> 18:38.276
(indistinct chattering)

18:38.278 --> 18:40.916
MAN (over speakers): Get out of here.
Get out of here, kid.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.947
(indistinct chattering)

18:42.949 --> 18:44.149
ERIN:
You see him yet?

18:44.151 --> 18:46.624
Not yet. Not yet.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.426
Come on.

18:49.428 --> 18:50.994
Where is this clown?

18:50.996 --> 18:52.866
Ticktock, Danny Reagan.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.844
We're gonna call an audible.

18:58.647 --> 19:00.813
All units, get ready to move in.

19:00.815 --> 19:01.781
Excuse me?

19:01.783 --> 19:02.981
We're gonna take 'em.

19:02.983 --> 19:04.213
On what grounds?
On my orders

19:04.215 --> 19:05.284
we move.

19:05.286 --> 19:06.780
What do you think
you're doing, Danny?

19:06.782 --> 19:08.386
I'm doing my job.
You have absolutely

19:08.388 --> 19:10.314
no grounds to arrest them.
Sure, I do.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.521
“Park closes at dusk.”

19:13.523 --> 19:15.456
Dusk?
Three...

19:15.458 --> 19:16.752
Come on, Danny. You've got
two...

19:16.754 --> 19:19.162
to be kidding me. Don't...
one. Move in.

19:19.860 --> 19:22.898
(tires screeching)
Copy that.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.868
Get out of the way! Move!

19:35.109 --> 19:39.111
(siren wailing)

19:39.113 --> 19:40.541
Yo! Five-O! Five-O!

19:40.543 --> 19:41.908
(bottles clattering)

19:41.910 --> 19:43.213
(tires screeching)

19:43.215 --> 19:45.316
Police! Get on the ground!

19:45.318 --> 19:46.747
Put your hands where I can
see them right now! Don't move!

19:46.749 --> 19:49.417
On the ground!
Get on the ground right now! (grunts)

19:49.419 --> 19:51.354
Now!

19:51.356 --> 19:53.016
Don't move! Get your hands up!

19:53.018 --> 19:53.951
Get down.

19:53.953 --> 19:56.422
Get on the ground.
On the ground.

19:57.352 --> 19:58.919
OFFICER (over speakers):
NYPD! Freeze!

19:58.921 --> 20:01.328
Where's your boss tonight,
tough guy?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.792
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

20:02.794 --> 20:04.314
Yeah, you do.
I didn't do nothing, man.

20:05.067 --> 20:07.034
Anybody got eyes on Perez?!

20:08.268 --> 20:10.773
OFFICER:
Get your hands up!

20:17.248 --> 20:19.120
Hi, Dad. Sorry to bother you.

20:19.122 --> 20:21.491
We have a problem.

20:25.634 --> 20:26.936
Sit down. Sit down!

20:27.238 --> 20:29.934
Come on. On your feet.
You got to be kidding me.

20:29.936 --> 20:31.942
Come on.
Man, this is bull.

20:31.944 --> 20:33.676
Shut up.
(wolf whistling)

20:33.678 --> 20:36.043
Danny,

20:36.045 --> 20:37.107
what was the point of all that?

20:37.109 --> 20:39.148
To catch bad guys.
This is exactly

20:39.150 --> 20:41.717
the kind of behavior
you were warned about.

20:41.719 --> 20:42.885
What, doing my job?

20:42.887 --> 20:44.149
No, harassment.

20:44.151 --> 20:45.388
You're just pissed
that you couldn't get your guy

20:45.390 --> 20:46.685
on the up and up, so, of course,

20:46.687 --> 20:48.189
once again, you overreact.

20:48.191 --> 20:49.989
No, I call it good police work.

20:49.991 --> 20:52.556
Doing... What?
So do I.

20:52.558 --> 20:53.964
You called Dad?

20:53.966 --> 20:55.795
Of course I called Dad.
What did you say?

20:55.797 --> 20:57.260
I said good job.

20:57.262 --> 21:00.302
Good job? These are bogus arrests.
There's nothing bogus

21:00.304 --> 21:02.705
about them.
Trespassing after dark, drinking

21:02.707 --> 21:04.532
at a city park--
that's against the law.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.114
Oh, great.

21:05.116 --> 21:06.882
So they get a summons.
In lieu of arrest.

21:06.884 --> 21:09.082
Which means the arresting
officer can handcuff them

21:09.084 --> 21:10.145
and transport 'em

21:10.147 --> 21:11.353
back down to the precinct.
Come on.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.413
On a technicality.
Wherein they're free

21:14.415 --> 21:17.381
to conduct a warrant check.
How many pop so far?

21:17.383 --> 21:18.820
Oh, at least ten.

21:18.822 --> 21:21.524
Okay, fine.
That's beside the point.

21:21.526 --> 21:24.358
It wasn't the objective.
We wanted to get Perez.

21:24.360 --> 21:27.169
We did. Danny was
flushing out Perez.

21:27.171 --> 21:29.098
He knows that without
their soldiers out on the street

21:29.100 --> 21:32.338
that Victor Perez is eventually
gonna stick his neck out.

21:32.340 --> 21:33.507
Oh, really?

21:33.509 --> 21:35.740
MAN:
Are you kidding me?

21:35.742 --> 21:37.077
You got to be playing me.

21:37.079 --> 21:40.317
You're locking up my boys
for being out after dusk?

21:44.988 --> 21:46.519
DANNY:
<i>In a city park.</i>

21:46.521 --> 21:47.854
PEREZ:
Come on.

21:47.856 --> 21:49.349
What is this,
<i>Sesame Street?</i>

21:49.351 --> 21:50.716
Think I'm joking,
talk to her.

21:50.718 --> 21:52.081
She's an assistant
district attorney.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.279
It's true.

21:53.281 --> 21:55.380
And while your associates
are being processed,

21:55.382 --> 21:58.019
the police are free to check
for any outstanding warrants.

21:58.021 --> 21:59.515
What are we up
to, Detective?

21:59.517 --> 22:01.649
Oh, about a dozen;
though with your crew,

22:01.651 --> 22:04.384
I'd guess the number's gonna
run more like about 25.

22:04.386 --> 22:06.088
Sound about right to you?

22:11.593 --> 22:14.431
A'ight.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.663
What you want?

22:15.665 --> 22:17.430
Mario Hunt.

22:23.535 --> 22:25.771
Where is he?

22:25.773 --> 22:28.034
You lost, son?

22:29.442 --> 22:30.976
Hunt don't run with us.

22:30.978 --> 22:33.144
He wit' the Warrior Kings.

22:33.146 --> 22:34.639
Yeah, I know who he “wit'.”

22:34.641 --> 22:38.940
I also know you mutts keep tabs
on each other, so where is he?

22:47.511 --> 22:49.276
I don't know.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.243
Okay.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.315
Suit yourself.

22:52.317 --> 22:53.616
We'll try it
again tomorrow.

22:53.618 --> 22:55.047
Tomorrow?
ERIN: That's right.

22:55.049 --> 22:57.180
He can do this every day
until he gets what he wants.

22:57.182 --> 22:58.514
DANNY:
Just so you know,

22:58.516 --> 23:00.411
those summonses
that your guys are racking up,

23:00.413 --> 23:02.018
they go for a couple
hundred bucks a pop.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.785
Not to mention having
all your guys locked up

23:03.787 --> 23:04.753
on these outstanding warrants

23:04.755 --> 23:06.489
is probably pretty bad
for business.

23:07.924 --> 23:09.258
I'm just saying.

23:13.364 --> 23:14.730
Hey.

23:20.575 --> 23:21.973
Mm-hmm?

23:21.975 --> 23:24.835
Look, I don't know
where he's at,

23:24.837 --> 23:27.275
but I might know
someone who does.

23:28.141 --> 23:29.906
Who?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.515
Chick I used to roll with.

23:31.517 --> 23:33.116
Name's Regina Tomlin.

23:33.118 --> 23:34.452
She Hunt's girl now.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.115
Maybe she know where he at.

23:36.117 --> 23:38.185
All right, then.

23:41.927 --> 23:43.798
I need a warrant to
go up on the girl.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.496
No, just go to her house
and interview her.

23:45.498 --> 23:47.703
You don't need a warrant for that.
What are you talking about?

23:47.705 --> 23:49.839
She's not gonna snitch
on one of the Warrior Kings.

23:49.841 --> 23:52.208
If I show up at the house
asking questions,

23:52.210 --> 23:55.178
it's only gonna tip them off
that I'm looking for Mario Hunt.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.412
I need a warrant.

23:56.414 --> 23:57.485
On what grounds?

23:57.487 --> 23:59.781
Whose side are you
on here, anyway?

23:59.783 --> 24:00.821
The law's.

24:00.823 --> 24:02.357
On what grounds?

24:02.359 --> 24:04.085
You heard Perez.

24:04.087 --> 24:06.325
He said the girl is
Mario Hunt's girlfriend,

24:06.327 --> 24:08.795
so Mario Hunt's gonna
need to check in at some point.

24:08.797 --> 24:10.657
And when he does,
if we're up on her phone,

24:10.659 --> 24:13.055
we can locate his cell
and nail this son of a bitch.

24:13.057 --> 24:14.358
I am sorry.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.293
If you want to eavesdrop
on her calls,

24:16.295 --> 24:18.124
you're gonna need
more than his say so.

24:18.126 --> 24:19.131
You need probable cause.

24:19.133 --> 24:21.790
Why won't you
work with me here?!

24:21.792 --> 24:23.862
Why don't you just
dirty up her phone?

24:23.864 --> 24:25.662
What?

24:25.664 --> 24:27.229
Get Perez to make
a dirty call.

24:27.231 --> 24:29.427
If she admits to any criminal
activity whatsoever, then...

24:29.429 --> 24:31.266
She implicates herself.

24:31.268 --> 24:32.898
You got probable cause.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.538
And then you get your warrant.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.834
Imagine that.

24:35.836 --> 24:38.137
So nice to see that all this
law school's working out

24:38.139 --> 24:39.471
for at least one Reagan.

24:39.473 --> 24:41.007
Good work.

24:46.313 --> 24:48.711
DANNY:
All right, you know the drill?

24:48.713 --> 24:49.943
I got it.

24:49.945 --> 24:52.384
You got to get Regina to agree
to move a key of heroin.

24:52.386 --> 24:53.721
We do that, we're good to go.

24:53.723 --> 24:55.122
Only once she's done that

24:55.124 --> 24:57.153
can you start rolling
on her line, is that clear?

24:57.155 --> 24:58.121
Copy that.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.123
All right.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.393
Let the games begin.

25:02.497 --> 25:04.760
(line ringing)

25:06.570 --> 25:08.264
REGINA:
Hello?

25:08.266 --> 25:10.536
Hey. What's up, Gina?

25:10.538 --> 25:11.703
How are you?

25:11.705 --> 25:13.334
Who is this? Perez?

25:13.336 --> 25:15.540
What-what are you doing
calling me?

25:15.542 --> 25:19.173
I told you I was done with you.

25:19.175 --> 25:21.441
I got a situation.

25:21.443 --> 25:23.670
Yeah, well,
I'm not your girl, remember?

25:23.672 --> 25:25.037
Might be something in it
for you.

25:25.039 --> 25:26.036
Yeah?

25:26.038 --> 25:27.444
Like what?

25:27.446 --> 25:30.907
Uh, we took a shipment
that's too much weight for us.

25:30.909 --> 25:32.778
Looking to get rid of
a key of H.

25:32.780 --> 25:35.576
Thought maybe you could
talk to your people,

25:35.578 --> 25:37.683
take ten percent for yourself.

25:37.685 --> 25:39.449
Look, don't call me no more,
a'ight?

25:39.451 --> 25:42.552
W-Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

25:42.554 --> 25:43.919
H-How about 15?

25:44.921 --> 25:47.285
How about 20?

25:48.126 --> 25:50.052
A'ight. A'ight.

25:50.054 --> 25:51.021
Hit you back.

25:51.023 --> 25:53.188
A'ight, hit you back.

25:57.499 --> 25:59.497
(line ringing)

26:01.067 --> 26:02.266
(quietly):
Who's she calling?

26:02.268 --> 26:03.729
MARIO:
What's up, baby girl?

26:03.731 --> 26:04.737
That's Mario.

26:04.739 --> 26:05.969
That's Mario's voice.

26:05.971 --> 26:07.840
REGINA:
Nothing. Just missing my man.

26:07.842 --> 26:09.471
Come on, you got a location?

26:09.473 --> 26:13.577
Listen, um, I know you're
laying low right now, but...

26:13.579 --> 26:14.913
Come on!

26:14.915 --> 26:16.547
...I might have a score for you.

26:16.549 --> 26:17.549
(computer beeping)

26:17.551 --> 26:19.222
156 Boyalton Avenue.

26:19.224 --> 26:21.992
Arthashastra.

26:23.298 --> 26:25.496
Son of a bitch, we got him.

26:28.770 --> 26:31.600
DANNY:
Step aside.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.684
All right, I want every way in
and out of this place covered.

26:41.686 --> 26:43.020
I'll hit the door
with these guys.

26:43.022 --> 26:44.221
The rest of you go around back.

26:44.223 --> 26:45.789
I'm going up top.

26:50.528 --> 26:52.693
(grunts)

27:10.185 --> 27:12.350
Go, go, go!

27:12.352 --> 27:15.623
Go. Let's go.
Move it, move it, move it.

27:28.961 --> 27:31.029
(groans)
You son of a bitch.

27:32.399 --> 27:34.428
Let me see your hands.

27:35.134 --> 27:36.700
Hey!

27:37.870 --> 27:40.664
Hold it!
You got nowhere to go, Mario!

27:47.037 --> 27:48.639
Hey!

27:54.009 --> 27:55.207
(groaning)

27:59.248 --> 28:00.677
(groaning continues)

28:01.848 --> 28:03.582
(yells)

28:04.721 --> 28:06.759
Help me, dude! I can't hang on!

28:06.761 --> 28:08.025
The hell did you think
you were going?

28:08.027 --> 28:09.225
Come on, dude, just help me!

28:09.227 --> 28:11.367
Come on, man!
I don't want to die!

28:11.369 --> 28:12.400
Come on.

28:12.402 --> 28:14.137
Please! (grunting)
Come on.

28:17.747 --> 28:19.578
(panting)

28:19.580 --> 28:20.651
On three.

28:20.653 --> 28:23.117
One, two...

28:23.119 --> 28:25.755
(screams)

28:26.589 --> 28:28.524
(groans)

28:30.230 --> 28:32.596
Please, please,
please don't drop me.

28:32.598 --> 28:33.893
I'm trying!

28:33.895 --> 28:35.565
Please, I don't want to die!

28:35.567 --> 28:37.366
Well, Chief Kent didn't want
to die either, did he?

28:37.368 --> 28:39.205
But you still killed
him, didn't you?

28:39.207 --> 28:41.205
I don't want to die!

28:41.207 --> 28:42.908
Tell me you killed Chief Kent
and his wife!

28:42.910 --> 28:45.276
(screams)

28:45.278 --> 28:47.139
Help me, dude.

28:47.141 --> 28:48.108
Tell me you killed him!

28:48.110 --> 28:49.012
(panting)

28:49.014 --> 28:51.085
Say it!
(screams)

28:51.087 --> 28:52.612
Yes.

28:52.614 --> 28:54.116
I did it. I did it.

28:54.118 --> 28:55.915
I killed him. I killed him.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.922
I killed them both. I'm sorry.

28:57.924 --> 28:59.186
(gasps)

28:59.188 --> 29:00.553
DANNY:
Help me get him up.

29:00.555 --> 29:01.952
Come on, help him up!

29:01.954 --> 29:03.254
I'm slipping!

29:03.256 --> 29:04.956
(groaning)

29:04.958 --> 29:06.819
Oh, God.

29:06.821 --> 29:08.291
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:08.293 --> 29:09.123
Oh, God.

29:09.125 --> 29:11.428
(panting)

29:11.430 --> 29:12.428
Mario Hunt,

29:12.430 --> 29:14.428
you're under arrest.

29:14.430 --> 29:16.229
Turn around.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.300
(indistinct radio transmission)

29:23.142 --> 29:24.403
Hey.

29:24.405 --> 29:25.403
Hey.

29:25.405 --> 29:26.505
Sounds like a close one.

29:26.507 --> 29:27.471
You sure you're okay?

29:27.473 --> 29:29.775
Yeah.

29:29.777 --> 29:30.976
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.176
I'm impressed.

29:32.178 --> 29:34.312
Not only did you put your life
on the line to save his,

29:34.314 --> 29:36.046
but you got a confession
out of it.

29:36.048 --> 29:38.349
Why am I expecting a “but”?

29:38.351 --> 29:42.182
He was dangling
15 stories from the roof, Danny.

29:42.184 --> 29:43.622
There's no judge in the country

29:43.624 --> 29:45.254
who's gonna find that
admissible.

29:45.256 --> 29:47.492
You want me to Mirandize the guy

29:47.494 --> 29:50.427
while I'm busy
saving his rotten life?

29:50.429 --> 29:53.629
I'm just the messenger, Danny.

29:59.039 --> 30:00.701
(sighs)

30:06.432 --> 30:08.237
So you heard?

30:08.238 --> 30:10.574
Yeah, I heard.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.141
Dad, on my word,
I didn't threaten the guy.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.237
I didn't coerce him.

30:13.239 --> 30:14.204
I saved that mutt's life.

30:14.206 --> 30:16.139
He spilled his guts
all on his own.

30:16.141 --> 30:18.505
I know that.

30:18.507 --> 30:20.640
Well, thank you.

30:20.642 --> 30:22.409
Though it doesn't matter.

30:22.411 --> 30:23.944
Not to the D.A.
it doesn't matter,

30:23.946 --> 30:25.815
and it won't matter
to a grand jury.

30:25.817 --> 30:27.183
Should matter.

30:27.185 --> 30:28.880
Well...

30:30.721 --> 30:32.351
You have to make it matter.

30:34.225 --> 30:35.687
What's that?

30:35.689 --> 30:37.525
That is all the gang cases

30:37.527 --> 30:40.018
Chief Kent sent to the D.A.
last year.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.919
All this in one year?

30:41.921 --> 30:44.588
And all of them stuck.

30:45.589 --> 30:49.655
See, he didn't just
make good collars.

30:49.657 --> 30:50.719
What'd he do?

30:50.721 --> 30:54.057
He tied them up
in neat little bows.

30:55.395 --> 30:59.168
It's time you learned
how to gift wrap.

31:18.629 --> 31:20.268
What do you want?

31:20.270 --> 31:22.637
Old friend can't come by
to check up on you?

31:22.639 --> 31:25.700
I told you, I don't got
nothing to say to you.

31:25.702 --> 31:29.171
I got nothing
to say to you either.

31:29.173 --> 31:30.707
Somebody else does.

31:35.918 --> 31:37.612
What the hell happened?

31:37.614 --> 31:38.851
Sit down.

31:39.717 --> 31:41.987
I said sit down!

31:42.685 --> 31:44.019
Oh, Curtis.

31:44.021 --> 31:45.385
Look at your face.

31:45.387 --> 31:48.352
What did they do to you?

31:48.354 --> 31:49.657
What did they
do to you?

31:49.659 --> 31:52.425
Please, you have to get him
out of here.

31:52.427 --> 31:54.264
He does not belong here.

31:54.266 --> 31:55.232
He does belong here, ma'am.

31:55.234 --> 31:56.464
Just step back
over there, please.

31:56.466 --> 31:57.632
No, it's... no...
Step over there, ma'am.

31:57.634 --> 31:58.631
Please.

31:58.633 --> 31:59.503
Mom, please, stop.

31:59.505 --> 32:01.399
Look, you got to tell me,

32:01.401 --> 32:03.039
what happened?

32:03.041 --> 32:04.271
Nothing.

32:04.273 --> 32:06.238
I fell.

32:08.113 --> 32:09.839
Warrior Kings did this?

32:09.841 --> 32:11.509
Your old pals.

32:11.511 --> 32:13.212
You sit here
watching their back,

32:13.214 --> 32:15.012
and that's how they watch yours.

32:15.014 --> 32:16.716
Curtis...

32:17.918 --> 32:20.085
...this has gone on long enough.

32:20.087 --> 32:23.222
You cannot protect these people
any longer.

32:23.224 --> 32:25.255
You must tell the police
the truth.

32:25.257 --> 32:26.665
And then what, Mom, huh?!

32:26.667 --> 32:28.034
First they give
you a black eye,

32:28.036 --> 32:29.363
next they'll put you
in a black box!

32:29.365 --> 32:32.268
You think I'm afraid
that they are going to kill me?!

32:32.270 --> 32:35.277
Guess what,
this is already killing me!

32:35.279 --> 32:37.376
Seeing you in here like this?!

32:37.378 --> 32:38.448
Calm down.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.319
No, no, Curtis,
I can't go on like this,

32:40.321 --> 32:41.719
not another minute.

32:41.721 --> 32:43.321
I'm sorry, son,
but if you choose to spend

32:43.323 --> 32:47.360
the rest of your life in here,
then I have nothing to live for!

32:47.362 --> 32:49.729
(crying)

32:51.465 --> 32:53.493
(whimpers)

33:08.964 --> 33:11.434
(door closes)

33:16.842 --> 33:19.471
We good?

33:19.473 --> 33:20.941
You're good.

33:20.943 --> 33:23.634
I'll get the video equipment.

33:23.636 --> 33:25.138
Just one thing.

33:25.140 --> 33:28.778
I thought you had that mother
on 24-hour protection.

33:28.803 --> 33:29.949
We do.

33:29.950 --> 33:31.347
Then how did she get
banged up like that?

33:31.349 --> 33:34.251
Detail must have slipped away
for a minute.

33:34.253 --> 33:36.357
Do not tell me
you willfully allowed that woman

33:36.359 --> 33:38.493
to be beaten
by a known gang member.

33:39.327 --> 33:41.093
Okay.

33:41.095 --> 33:43.127
I didn't.

33:43.129 --> 33:44.129
Danny Reagan.

33:44.130 --> 33:46.264
But I did willfully allow her

33:46.266 --> 33:48.335
to sit down with the makeup team

33:48.337 --> 33:49.470
from the decoy unit.

33:49.472 --> 33:50.734
That's a makeup job?

33:50.736 --> 33:52.039
Mm-hmm.

33:54.809 --> 33:55.974
She lied.

33:55.976 --> 33:57.942
To save his life.

34:03.984 --> 34:07.190
Mario Hunt...

34:07.192 --> 34:09.389
shot Chief Kent.

34:10.289 --> 34:12.326
He told me so himself.

34:12.328 --> 34:14.527
Even had pictures on his phone.

34:14.529 --> 34:16.864
DANNY:
And who shot Hector Florez?

34:16.867 --> 34:18.866
I did.

34:18.868 --> 34:20.435
DANNY:
Why?

34:20.437 --> 34:22.371
CURTIS:
Because Mario Hunt

34:22.373 --> 34:25.011
ordered me to.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.693
What do you want?

34:46.967 --> 34:50.572
I want you to say everything you
said dangling from the rooftop.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.175
Only this time,
tell it to the camera.

35:00.122 --> 35:02.288
(sighs heavily)

35:07.958 --> 35:10.018
Detective Reagan's here, sir.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.289
Send him in.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.221
With Sergeant Kent, sir.

35:14.054 --> 35:15.417
(drops pen on desk)

35:15.419 --> 35:17.382
Oh. Well...

35:17.384 --> 35:19.413
send 'em both in.

35:19.415 --> 35:21.348
(taps hand on desk)

35:22.190 --> 35:23.853
Hey.
Hey.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.222
Hope you don't mind.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.862
I bumped into Thomas
on the way down.

35:26.864 --> 35:28.390
He asked if he
could come along.

35:28.392 --> 35:29.726
Whatever you need, Thomas.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.695
Please.

35:35.502 --> 35:38.099
It's not something I need
so much as, wanted to say.

35:38.101 --> 35:40.171
Shoot.
Figure word

35:40.173 --> 35:41.939
might have gotten back to you
that I had kind of a beef

35:41.941 --> 35:43.970
with how
we went after these guys?

35:43.972 --> 35:46.043
“We” meaning me?

35:46.045 --> 35:47.708
The department.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.747
You weren't alone
in that feeling.

35:49.749 --> 35:52.052
I was the one caught
in the middle of it.

35:52.054 --> 35:53.517
They were my parents.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.956
Yes.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.717
So I wanted you
to know, face-to-face,

35:56.718 --> 36:00.061
I'm real proud
how it turned out.

36:01.429 --> 36:03.763
And what drove that?

36:03.765 --> 36:05.426
Me asking myself,

36:05.428 --> 36:07.993
asking my men,

36:07.995 --> 36:10.399
“What would Don Kent do?”

36:10.401 --> 36:12.263
Yes, sir.

36:12.265 --> 36:13.831
I get that now.

36:13.833 --> 36:17.069
I'll second that.

36:18.473 --> 36:20.407
And you coming up here

36:20.409 --> 36:24.571
to tell me...
means the world to me.

36:30.577 --> 36:32.543
Thomas?

36:32.545 --> 36:34.046
Sir?

36:34.048 --> 36:35.581
A year ago,

36:35.583 --> 36:38.748
your dad came into this office
to pull his pin.

36:39.719 --> 36:43.451
And the reason he stayed--

36:43.453 --> 36:45.452
you're looking at him.

36:45.454 --> 36:48.326
I know that, sir.

36:52.170 --> 36:54.506
You're dad would be alive today

36:54.508 --> 36:57.940
if he hadn't stayed.

37:00.248 --> 37:02.618
What my dad would have said?

37:02.620 --> 37:03.954
It's not

37:03.956 --> 37:06.088
the years
in your life that count.

37:06.090 --> 37:09.086
It's the life in your years.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.050
Abraham Lincoln.

37:12.052 --> 37:13.783
I know my father

37:13.785 --> 37:15.886
was honored
that you thought enough of him

37:15.888 --> 37:17.789
to ask him to stay.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.988
The honor was mine.

37:29.794 --> 37:32.000
(dog barking in distance)

37:32.803 --> 37:35.601
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

37:35.603 --> 37:37.801
(door closes)

37:54.786 --> 37:57.720
I got this.

38:00.394 --> 38:02.392
I supposed
to be honored or something?

38:02.394 --> 38:05.327
I won't take much
of your time.

38:05.329 --> 38:07.546
Take all you want, Commish.
Time I got.

38:07.570 --> 38:08.303
I wanted to be

38:08.304 --> 38:10.767
the first to tell you,
you are under arrest

38:10.769 --> 38:14.036
for ordering the murder
of NYPD Chief Donald Kent,

38:14.038 --> 38:17.571
his wife, Maggie,
the murder of Hector Florez,

38:17.573 --> 38:20.371
and the attempted murder
of Linda Reagan.

38:20.373 --> 38:22.508
You think I don't already know
I been snitched on?

38:22.510 --> 38:25.348
Always good to get official
confirmation, don't you think?

38:25.350 --> 38:26.852
Seeing as you ain't got

38:26.854 --> 38:29.486
no death penalty,
and I'm already doing life--

38:29.488 --> 38:32.887
that's like what,
you know, anticlimax?

38:32.889 --> 38:34.759
Mm. We take what we can get.

38:34.761 --> 38:36.264
Also, thing is,

38:36.266 --> 38:38.300
it's gonna be hard
for Mario Hunt to rat on me

38:38.302 --> 38:40.342
when he ain't got a tongue
in his mouth no more.

38:40.344 --> 38:43.808
Mr. Hunt and Mr. Turner
and his mother are already

38:43.810 --> 38:45.818
in our witness
protection program.

38:45.820 --> 38:49.122
I can get anybody
who needs to get got.

38:49.124 --> 38:51.120
I know that.

38:51.122 --> 38:52.687
Even from prison.

38:52.689 --> 38:55.191
You think you got the long arm
of the law?

38:55.193 --> 38:58.223
But that's nothing compared
to the long arm of the outlaw.

38:58.225 --> 39:02.695
Don Kent was a friend of mine.

39:02.697 --> 39:06.537
And you know,
when you lose a good friend,

39:06.539 --> 39:11.275
sometimes you hang on
to something

39:11.277 --> 39:12.948
that was theirs,

39:12.950 --> 39:15.949
a memento of a kind, you know?

39:15.951 --> 39:17.814
Like a jacket or something.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.720
Yeah, exactly.

39:19.722 --> 39:22.760
And in this case,
it was a box, you know,

39:22.762 --> 39:24.424
with personal things in it.

39:24.426 --> 39:27.264
And in the box was
a piece of paper.

39:27.266 --> 39:29.097
And the paper said that, um,

39:29.099 --> 39:32.137
he'd taken an oath
from some federal marshal,

39:32.139 --> 39:35.274
uh, you know, so he could work
for the DEA.

39:35.276 --> 39:38.148
Just a boilerplate
kind of thing.

39:38.150 --> 39:40.076
Why-why you going on
about this, man?

39:40.078 --> 39:41.644
Why am I going on about it?

39:41.646 --> 39:43.748
Well, here's the deal.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.283
That oath made Don Kent

39:46.285 --> 39:49.320
a federal cop.

39:49.322 --> 39:53.456
And though we don't got
no death penalty...

39:53.458 --> 39:56.327
the Feds do.

39:59.193 --> 40:01.968
Tonight, you will be transferred

40:01.970 --> 40:05.673
to the federal prison
at Terre Haute, Indiana,

40:05.675 --> 40:07.601
where you will await trial

40:07.603 --> 40:09.808
for the murder
of Chief Don Kent,

40:09.810 --> 40:12.009
a federal officer.

40:15.084 --> 40:17.586
But I'll see you again,
Mr. Wallace.

40:17.588 --> 40:21.123
At the execution chamber
there at Terre Haute.

40:23.190 --> 40:27.230
I'll wave to you
through the observation glass.

40:29.096 --> 40:32.037
Until then.

40:35.574 --> 40:37.740
(groaning)

40:40.677 --> 40:42.875
Can you hear us, okay?

40:42.877 --> 40:44.275
DANNY:
Yeah. Is this, uh,

40:44.277 --> 40:45.749
department-issued
equipment here?

40:45.751 --> 40:47.822
Yes, it is.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.253
Might want to put in
for an upgrade.

40:49.254 --> 40:51.349
(laughter)
Linda, can you hear us okay?

40:51.351 --> 40:52.686
LINDA:
Just fine, Frank.

40:52.688 --> 40:53.990
Good.

40:53.992 --> 40:56.328
BOTH:
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

40:56.330 --> 40:58.128
Hey, guys.
Hi, guys.

40:58.130 --> 41:00.630
So, what are you guys
eating for dinner?

41:00.632 --> 41:02.094
DANNY:
Um, hard to say.

41:02.096 --> 41:03.767
Looks like, uh,

41:03.769 --> 41:04.903
critter or varmint.

41:04.905 --> 41:06.072
What?

41:06.074 --> 41:08.104
DANNY:
Yeah, and, uh, some

41:08.106 --> 41:09.272
vegetable matter on the side.

41:09.274 --> 41:10.609
Hey, this is Jamie.

41:10.611 --> 41:12.041
What are you guys
talking about?

41:12.043 --> 41:13.945
Uh, it's hospital food, Jamie.
You ever heard of it?

41:13.947 --> 41:15.818
Oh, no. Who screwed up?

41:15.820 --> 41:17.082
Shh.
FRANK: Hey, don't look at me.

41:17.084 --> 41:18.555
I did the speakerphone.

41:18.557 --> 41:19.892
It was supposed to be here...
I thought you said you called it in.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.232
It's supposed
to be there already.

41:22.234 --> 41:24.033
Well, it's supposed
to be 2:00.

41:24.035 --> 41:25.897
(knocking over speaker)
LINDA: There's someone at the door.

41:25.899 --> 41:28.233
Someone's at the door,
guys. Hold on.

41:29.106 --> 41:31.104
I wonder who that could be.

41:31.106 --> 41:33.239
(Frank chuckles)

41:33.241 --> 41:35.742
Dinner for two.
Oh.

41:37.714 --> 41:39.177
LINDA:
What?

41:39.179 --> 41:40.416
DANNY:
<i>Proper</i> dinner for two.

41:40.418 --> 41:43.121
LINDA (laughing):
What is this? Oh, my.

41:43.123 --> 41:45.660
ALL:
Surprise!

41:45.662 --> 41:47.828
What did you guys do?

41:47.830 --> 41:50.028
We had the Palm
send them a decent meal.

41:50.030 --> 41:51.331
Why don't we get the Palm?

41:51.333 --> 41:53.362
Because you didn't get shot.

41:53.364 --> 41:54.563
DANNY:
Easy, boys.

41:54.565 --> 41:55.699
LINDA:
This is amazing.

41:55.701 --> 41:57.332
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

41:57.334 --> 41:58.501
HENRY: You're welcome.
You're welcome.

41:58.503 --> 41:59.869
You're welcome.

41:59.871 --> 42:01.943
It's the least we could do
with you there and us here.

42:01.945 --> 42:03.345
DANNY:
How about this wine?

42:03.347 --> 42:05.082
Are we even allowed to drink
this in a hospital room?

42:05.084 --> 42:07.387
Well, yeah,
if you don't broadcast it.

42:07.389 --> 42:09.219
DANNY:
Copy that.

42:09.221 --> 42:11.523
Uh, listen,
our food is getting cold.

42:11.525 --> 42:12.789
Could we say grace?

42:12.791 --> 42:14.357
Yeah. All together?

42:15.231 --> 42:16.797
No.

42:19.271 --> 42:20.933
LINDA:
Please.

42:23.175 --> 42:27.539
Okay, Linda, you got it,
but you start.

42:27.541 --> 42:29.539
Bless us, O Lord...

42:29.541 --> 42:31.813
ALL:
For these, Thy gifts,

42:31.815 --> 42:33.078
which we are about to receive

42:33.803 --> 42:36.652
from Thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord, Amen.
