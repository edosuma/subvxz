00:04.450 --> 00:10.121
Would you ever think that rebuilding
a home would cause such devastation?

00:10.122 --> 00:13.792
I saw what appeared to be a man.

00:13.793 --> 00:17.120
They were coming from inside the walls.

00:17.121 --> 00:20.080
There was a lot of pressure down
there, like, I got to get out of here.

00:20.081 --> 00:21.995
They conjured up demons.

00:21.996 --> 00:26.866
All this time, they had
been lurking down there.

00:26.867 --> 00:30.587
They're gonna keep hurting me.

00:31.005 --> 00:33.525
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:33.708 --> 00:34.841
Stay away from me!

00:34.842 --> 00:39.042
It's like the final conflict for me.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.658
Good evening. A burning
building turns into a death trap.

00:51.659 --> 00:56.029
The blaze in a four-story apartment house
trapped the firefighters in the top floor.

00:56.030 --> 00:59.630
All six were forced to jump.

01:00.446 --> 01:04.736
I'm sad to tell the people of this
great city that we have lost...

01:04.736 --> 01:07.097
Two of our bravest today.

01:07.098 --> 01:10.176
My husband, Curt, was a
New York City firefighter.

01:10.177 --> 01:13.012
I never thought that
he wouldn't come home.

01:13.013 --> 01:15.281
We just loved being a family.

01:15.282 --> 01:17.317
We just had kind of a plan.

01:17.318 --> 01:22.679
This is the way I saw my parents
do it, and it just is a natural...

01:22.680 --> 01:26.520
Flow of things. Never thinking...

01:26.683 --> 01:28.963
That uh...

01:30.130 --> 01:32.031
That it all fell apart so quickly.

01:32.032 --> 01:35.211
They were faced with
the horrifying choice,

01:35.212 --> 01:40.844
of either jumping from the fourth
floor window or being burned to death.

01:40.845 --> 01:45.479
Lieutenant Curtis Meyran
of battalion twenty six.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.080
And firefighter John Bellew...

01:50.385 --> 01:53.387
The first thing I thought of was...

01:53.388 --> 01:55.148
How...

01:55.149 --> 01:58.629
Do I tell these children...

01:59.532 --> 02:03.317
That they'll never
see their father again?

02:03.318 --> 02:05.265
They were inconsolable.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.401
How can I get them through this?

02:07.402 --> 02:09.301
They don't have a father.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.533
I mean, I don't think you
ever really could be prepared,

02:11.534 --> 02:14.674
but it definitely hit me really hard.

02:14.675 --> 02:18.879
I just remember sitting,
crying our eyes out.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.915
I'll never forget that day.

02:21.916 --> 02:24.984
This was a very high profile tragedy.

02:24.985 --> 02:29.989
There were those towers and
cameras all over the walk.

02:29.990 --> 02:31.491
No, I have nothing to say.

02:31.492 --> 02:33.793
- Want your side of the story...
- Just leave us alone.

02:33.794 --> 02:39.694
The paparazzi from hell. It was
terrible. There was no compassion.

02:41.469 --> 02:45.191
It was just constant, you know? They
wanted pictures, they wanted interviews.

02:45.192 --> 02:48.973
They wanted to talk to us, and
we just wanted to be left alone.

02:48.974 --> 02:53.516
I said, maybe we should try to
find some little, small place,

02:53.517 --> 02:58.304
that we could maybe escape from this,
away from the city, away from the cameras.

02:58.305 --> 03:02.205
And hopefully to find some peace.

03:04.291 --> 03:06.626
We stumbled across a house.

03:06.627 --> 03:10.175
The attraction was that it
was a big piece of property,

03:10.176 --> 03:13.166
an acre of land, which was
actually unheard of on Long Island.

03:13.167 --> 03:18.751
I began to see that this may be
a way to give them a new life.

03:18.752 --> 03:24.152
To wean them from their
daddy's place that he built.

03:27.615 --> 03:30.087
When we were finally able
to move into the house,

03:30.088 --> 03:32.121
you know, we brought bags of stuff.

03:32.122 --> 03:33.963
We were all very anxious
to kind of just get in

03:33.964 --> 03:35.987
and get everything
where it needed to be.

03:35.988 --> 03:39.025
I felt like it was gonna be the
start of something really good.

03:39.026 --> 03:42.428
I was gonna get lot of help
in building this new home.

03:42.429 --> 03:45.125
My husband's fireman
buddies all chipped in.

03:45.126 --> 03:49.636
One in particular was a
fireman... my husband's friend Tom.

03:49.637 --> 03:51.705
We have a strong
brotherhood, the firefighters.

03:51.706 --> 03:57.606
There were a lot of members of the Fire
Department that wanted to help Jeanette.

03:57.812 --> 04:00.847
Listen, Jen, just a couple of
more weeks, and we're done, eh?

04:00.848 --> 04:04.688
- Oh, yeah.
- Couple more weeks.

04:05.052 --> 04:09.956
I was determined to make these
children have hope and feel better.

04:09.957 --> 04:13.146
In your wildest dreams,
would you ever think,

04:13.147 --> 04:16.159
that rebuilding a home would cause,

04:16.160 --> 04:19.533
such devastation to a family?

04:19.534 --> 04:21.761
While the house was being
built, it was all open.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.371
I was worried about vandalism. I was
worried about tools being left out.

04:25.372 --> 04:31.272
We put up seven security cameras...
every corner of the house.

04:34.654 --> 04:39.155
The feed from the cameras was
patched through to the computer.

04:39.156 --> 04:45.056
So the first night doing this, it
was a new toy for me, so I tuned in.

04:46.934 --> 04:52.834
And they were in black and white.
You really couldn't see much.

05:01.686 --> 05:05.569
But right in the middle
of the frame I saw,

05:05.570 --> 05:07.847
what appeared to be a man.

05:07.848 --> 05:10.817
It just made no sense.

05:10.818 --> 05:12.858
Maybe there's something on the lens,

05:12.859 --> 05:15.555
or maybe there's something
wrong with the camera.

05:15.556 --> 05:20.356
I really didn't know
what I was looking at.

05:28.435 --> 05:33.736
Pretty soon after we moved
in, I was laying in my room...

05:33.737 --> 05:37.266
And I was feeling really restless...

05:37.267 --> 05:41.167
And I had a very uneasy feeling.

06:03.570 --> 06:07.350
I remember hearing these sounds.

06:08.109 --> 06:14.009
They were coming from inside the
walls... like thumps or knocking.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.025
Hello?

06:25.026 --> 06:30.926
It was like someone was knocking
on the door, like... knock, knock.

06:31.729 --> 06:33.709
Hello?

06:46.647 --> 06:52.547
The second time I heard it, it was,
notice me, notice me, notice me.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.120
They were coming from inside the walls.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.658
And I'd make, like, a little fortress.

07:32.659 --> 07:37.714
It didn't feel safe, but it felt
good enough that I could just sleep...

07:37.715 --> 07:43.235
And wake up, and it wouldn't
be there in the morning.

07:43.470 --> 07:44.839
What's up?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.006
You two girls look terrible.

07:47.007 --> 07:50.147
I asked her the next morning
if she was walking around

07:50.148 --> 07:52.673
at night or if she was
thumping or doing something.

07:52.674 --> 07:55.567
I heard it too. It was banging.

07:55.568 --> 07:57.650
I honestly had not heard anything.

07:57.651 --> 08:01.262
And they were telling me
something was banging on the walls.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.022
They couldn't describe it.

08:03.023 --> 08:07.078
Girls, it's just a new
house. There you go.

08:07.079 --> 08:12.979
I didn't let her know that I
was really as scared as I was.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.595
And I just said, you know,
maybe it's the house settling,

08:21.596 --> 08:24.968
or maybe it's the plumbing
and the heating in the pipes.

08:24.969 --> 08:30.849
It's new to us. We have to
learn the sounds of the house.

09:05.552 --> 09:10.117
I just need to reassure
them and calm them down.

09:10.118 --> 09:16.018
And just give them some sort of peace of
mind that it's nothing to be afraid of.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.625
It was a unique basement,
to say the least.

09:22.626 --> 09:26.886
There was a lot of debris down there.

09:35.649 --> 09:39.851
The backyard was huge, and to me, it
was, personally, just like a playground.

09:39.852 --> 09:43.032
It was like my heaven.

09:43.724 --> 09:49.093
I thought it was really cool that we had
this whole backyard full of all these...

09:49.094 --> 09:51.914
Trees and symbols.

09:56.070 --> 09:59.910
There were bones in my backyard.

10:03.911 --> 10:06.079
Me and my sister found
this really exciting.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.980
We were gonna use the
symbols that we had found,

10:08.981 --> 10:14.020
and we were gonna draw
maps to help us find things.

10:14.021 --> 10:16.956
Well, I tried to help
Jeanette as much as I can.

10:16.957 --> 10:21.393
They already had enough to deal with
with the loss of their husband and father.

10:21.394 --> 10:23.850
And I had a couple of
guys that worked for me,

10:23.851 --> 10:26.928
cleaning out a lot of the
stuff from the previous owners.

10:26.929 --> 10:32.829
And that's when some things were
discovered down in the basement.

10:45.386 --> 10:49.706
I drew her a map to get to her doll.

10:49.957 --> 10:52.231
Hey, no. Go right.

10:52.232 --> 10:57.140
All she had to do was follow the
directions on the map, and she would be

10:57.141 --> 11:00.110
able to figure out where her doll
was, and then if she found it, she won.

11:00.111 --> 11:02.871
Okay, go forward.

11:06.006 --> 11:08.046
Crunch!

11:08.608 --> 11:10.948
The hell...

11:11.111 --> 11:15.851
Jeanette, I think you
should come down here.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.988
Hi, guys.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.923
What's up? What's the matter?

11:23.924 --> 11:26.426
I just saw the looks on their faces.

11:26.427 --> 11:27.860
Jen, we, um...

11:27.861 --> 11:33.681
We... we found this under some
junk that was on the floor.

11:35.902 --> 11:41.662
The whole thing was exposed.
I saw it for the first time.

11:43.210 --> 11:47.410
I don't want the girls to see this.

11:51.452 --> 11:54.452
Just get rid of it.

11:54.788 --> 11:56.456
Cover it up.

11:56.457 --> 11:58.908
Yeah, we'll concrete
the whole thing, Jen.

11:58.909 --> 12:01.094
The girls will never
even know it was here.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.988
Right? Nobody has to see it.

12:02.989 --> 12:06.265
You paint over something.
You don't see it anymore.

12:06.266 --> 12:09.746
It's gone... so you think.

12:11.438 --> 12:15.320
There was no reason to say anything to my
mom because there were stars on the ground,

12:15.321 --> 12:20.181
and I didn't think my
mom would really care.

12:26.086 --> 12:30.089
My mom had left me alone in the house.

12:30.090 --> 12:35.990
She had given me instructions when she
left that she wanted me to clean up.

12:36.296 --> 12:41.396
And I just remember
feeling like I wasn't alone.

12:56.716 --> 13:02.616
I looked back behind me a couple of
times, and there was nobody there.

13:02.886 --> 13:03.900
Mom?

13:03.901 --> 13:07.006
I couldn't shake this feeling
of having somebody watching me,

13:07.007 --> 13:11.447
and it was really starting to bother me.

13:22.642 --> 13:24.442
Ah!

13:41.228 --> 13:46.060
When I came home and
walked in the front door...

13:46.061 --> 13:50.021
I saw every cabinet, every drawer.

13:50.304 --> 13:53.139
The place looked like
it had been ransacked.

13:53.140 --> 13:57.515
Everything was open,
and I didn't see Angela.

13:57.516 --> 13:59.556
Angela?

13:59.722 --> 14:03.090
I thought that Angela had a tantrum...

14:03.091 --> 14:04.191
Angela!

14:04.192 --> 14:08.229
Some kind of fit. What on
Earth were you thinking?

14:08.230 --> 14:09.297
Angela.

14:09.298 --> 14:13.167
When I approached her and I saw
the look on her face and her eyes...

14:13.168 --> 14:15.670
It wasn't me.

14:15.671 --> 14:17.238
There's something in the house.

14:17.239 --> 14:22.099
I knew that it was not
her. I just knew it.

14:23.612 --> 14:29.372
Was someone trying to hurt us?
Was someone physically here?

14:33.489 --> 14:38.949
When I went down there, I
definitely was uncomfortable.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.814
Hey, guys.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.483
- Tom?
- Oh, hey, Jen.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.785
You wanted to show me something?

15:03.786 --> 15:09.126
They pulled out these pieces
of paper bound together.

15:23.368 --> 15:25.588
And I saw 1927.

15:25.589 --> 15:29.577
Okay, I know this is
when they built the house.

15:29.578 --> 15:32.766
The pages seemed to be
written by the young girl

15:32.767 --> 15:35.149
that was the daughter
of someone in this house.

15:35.150 --> 15:38.510
I saw the name Christina.

15:39.521 --> 15:43.964
I realized that she was only a few
years older than my own daughters.

15:43.965 --> 15:49.435
As I read through the pages,
it was an incredibly dark story.

15:49.436 --> 15:51.236
She would talk about her father.

15:51.237 --> 15:56.107
There were sacrifices... he hurt
me again, or, he hurts the animals.

15:56.108 --> 15:59.578
They're bleeding, and
I bleed like they bleed.

15:59.579 --> 16:05.459
These people were sick. This
is what went on in this house.

16:09.889 --> 16:12.292
But it's mine now. It's
gonna be fresh and new.

16:12.293 --> 16:16.044
And no one needs to know. And
it's over, and it's done with.

16:16.045 --> 16:18.565
Oh! Hey, Jen.

16:20.078 --> 16:22.085
Thanks again. I couldn't
have done it without you.

16:22.086 --> 16:24.236
No problem.

16:24.237 --> 16:26.638
Hey, you take care now, okay?

16:26.639 --> 16:27.806
- We'll see you soon.
- Yup.

16:27.807 --> 16:29.180
Okay.

16:29.181 --> 16:32.661
All right, boys, let's go.

16:33.312 --> 16:36.012
Thanks, everyone.

16:55.234 --> 16:57.154
Bang!

17:04.477 --> 17:08.566
I thought maybe at first,
it was the oil burner...

17:08.567 --> 17:11.950
Backfired or something
that kind of pressure.

17:11.951 --> 17:13.585
It sounded like almost a shot.

17:13.586 --> 17:15.020
Bang!

17:15.021 --> 17:19.148
I felt that it was coming
from the cellar, the basement,

17:19.150 --> 17:23.210
because you would feel that
impact mostly in the floor

17:23.211 --> 17:27.891
and vibrating almost
up through the ceiling.

17:30.637 --> 17:36.017
I knew that I had to go see
or at least try to find out...

17:36.018 --> 17:38.478
What it was.

17:38.711 --> 17:42.311
You couldn't just ignore it.

17:44.016 --> 17:49.596
I went to the cellar door,
and I started to head down.

18:26.826 --> 18:27.926
What's that?

18:27.927 --> 18:30.615
I felt something evil.

18:30.616 --> 18:33.331
I was so frightened.

18:33.332 --> 18:36.167
I did not feel, at that point anymore,

18:36.168 --> 18:39.978
that there was something wrong with
plumbing or anything backfiring.

18:39.979 --> 18:45.879
You had a feeling that it was
something that was not of this world.

18:56.689 --> 18:59.111
<i>♪ Burn this city down.</i>

18:59.112 --> 19:02.352
<i>♪ Can't take it all.</i>

19:43.802 --> 19:46.997
I remember it was very
faint, and you would think,

19:46.998 --> 19:50.308
let's try really, really hard to
listen and hear what they're saying.

19:50.309 --> 19:54.937
It was a conversation back and
forth between two people very low,

19:54.938 --> 20:00.838
almost secretive, like they didn't
want you to hear what they were saying.

20:09.729 --> 20:11.589
Mom?

20:12.331 --> 20:15.151
Mom, is that you?

20:17.503 --> 20:23.023
I get this very uneasy
feeling that I'm being watched.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.418
This is our house, our house...

20:33.419 --> 20:35.854
I would hear them, you
know, use our names.

20:35.855 --> 20:38.824
- Next Danine. Get Danine...
- Get Danine.

20:38.825 --> 20:41.159
They started using my sister's name.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.160
Get Danine...

20:42.161 --> 20:45.881
I heard him tell me he was...

20:50.970 --> 20:53.310
I'm sorry.

21:00.913 --> 21:04.948
I'm still getting this creepy feeling
that someone's really watching, focusing,

21:04.949 --> 21:10.709
and I look through the frosted
glass of the shower door...

21:13.481 --> 21:16.181
- Mom!
- Danine!

21:18.900 --> 21:22.102
I heard this bloodcurdling "mom"!

21:22.103 --> 21:25.137
At the top of her lungs
over and over again.

21:25.138 --> 21:29.041
Mom! Mom! I'd never heard
anything like that in my life.

21:29.042 --> 21:30.028
Danine!

21:30.029 --> 21:35.549
I don't ever remember being
more scared, not knowing...

21:35.989 --> 21:39.182
How to protect her. Or if I...

21:39.183 --> 21:43.377
If I was even going to be able
to, get there before they did.

21:43.378 --> 21:45.352
Mom! Mom!

21:45.353 --> 21:46.591
Mom!

21:46.592 --> 21:49.895
He's going to hurt me. There was no
doubt in my mind; He was going to hurt me.

21:49.896 --> 21:51.956
- Danine!
- Mom!

21:51.957 --> 21:54.292
- Danine!
- Danine!

21:54.293 --> 21:56.801
Open the door!

21:56.802 --> 21:58.662
Mom!

22:04.954 --> 22:07.067
Mom! Mom!

22:07.068 --> 22:08.634
Mom!

22:08.635 --> 22:11.104
- Danine!
- Danine!

22:11.105 --> 22:13.139
- Danine!
- Open the door!

22:13.140 --> 22:16.200
- Mom! Mom!
- Danine!

22:16.412 --> 22:18.244
Danine, honey, Sweetie... oh, jeez.

22:18.245 --> 22:21.414
It looked like almost she was having
a seizure, she was that frightened.

22:21.415 --> 22:23.350
- Come on, sweetheart.
- It was right there.

22:23.351 --> 22:24.417
Come on, sweetheart.

22:24.418 --> 22:28.054
A shadow... I don't know
who, but he was right there.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.555
But, honey, there's nobody here.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.891
It was right there. There
was a shadow right there.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.360
Honey, there's nobody here.

22:33.361 --> 22:35.395
- There's nobody here.
- Yes, there was.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.530
Come on now. Come on now.

22:37.531 --> 22:40.483
Come on. Okay, come on,
Danine. Shh, shh, shh.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.304
Come on. You too.

22:46.773 --> 22:50.733
Okay, just keep moving, all right?

22:55.816 --> 22:59.416
You could hear this chanting.

23:01.622 --> 23:07.082
It sounded like a group of
people performing a ritual.

23:07.294 --> 23:11.434
It was very scary. You felt trapped.

23:16.337 --> 23:18.677
Tell him...

23:22.009 --> 23:23.929
Bang!

23:24.211 --> 23:27.147
And I said, just call daddy.

23:27.148 --> 23:29.416
Just call for daddy.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.251
And that's what we did.

23:31.252 --> 23:33.053
Daddy. Daddy will protect us.

23:33.054 --> 23:34.354
- Daddy!
- Dad.

23:34.355 --> 23:36.022
- Please help us.
- Daddy.

23:36.023 --> 23:37.757
Dad, please help us.

23:37.758 --> 23:41.657
This is the time, more than
anything, that I needed my dad.

23:41.658 --> 23:45.063
That I needed him to be there,
and I knew that if he was there,

23:45.064 --> 23:48.134
everything would just be fine.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.803
How do you make your baby feel better?

23:50.804 --> 23:54.704
How do you protect your children?

23:54.875 --> 23:56.742
How can you fight what you can't see?

23:56.743 --> 23:59.883
- Daddy!
- Please protect us.

23:59.884 --> 24:01.744
Dad!

24:02.883 --> 24:05.218
My husband has a friend... Tony.

24:05.219 --> 24:08.154
We talked quite often
and were very close.

24:08.155 --> 24:11.958
And if anyone would believe
me, it would be Tony.

24:11.959 --> 24:14.988
I remember getting a call from
Jeanette after she built the house,

24:14.989 --> 24:17.442
saying there was weird stuff going on.

24:17.443 --> 24:21.334
Her husband, Curt, was one
of my very dear friends.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.360
He was a good man.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.297
I explained to him about
the circle with the star.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.389
And trying to explain to
him these journals so...

24:29.390 --> 24:33.746
That's when he agreed to go
downstairs and have a look at things.

24:33.747 --> 24:36.782
I took him to the door.
I said, I'll wait here.

24:36.783 --> 24:40.153
I just refused to go down.

24:40.154 --> 24:42.489
I'll go down and see what's down there.

24:42.490 --> 24:46.126
She was very frightened of
the basement for some reason.

24:46.127 --> 24:49.802
There's very few things I fear
besides my father and my dentist,

24:49.803 --> 24:53.833
but you just felt like
you were being watched.

24:53.834 --> 24:59.734
There was a lot of pressure down
there, like, I got to get out of here.

25:23.464 --> 25:28.024
Something drags my
attention to this door.

25:33.507 --> 25:37.760
What's behind the door
down here, Jeanette?

25:37.761 --> 25:43.041
It could be wind. It could
be something down there.

25:54.006 --> 25:56.526
Oof! It shut.

25:57.470 --> 26:00.633
I said, well, time for me to go.

26:00.634 --> 26:06.055
I worked for 24 years as a correction
officer, and I fear very little.

26:06.056 --> 26:09.956
But that basement made me scared.

26:10.010 --> 26:12.776
From that point on, we all
felt it was a good idea that

26:12.777 --> 26:18.417
we have one person stand
guard while one of us showered.

26:20.921 --> 26:23.768
Why didn't I leave the house?

26:23.769 --> 26:25.991
I've invested everything in this house:

26:25.992 --> 26:30.716
Time, money, energy,
emotions, everything we had.

26:30.717 --> 26:34.274
The firemen, they built
that with such pride.

26:34.275 --> 26:37.737
And I felt like I would
be letting them down.

26:37.738 --> 26:42.654
I knew that unless I could
find a solution quickly...

26:42.655 --> 26:48.555
That we were going to have to
leave this house and move out.

26:56.790 --> 27:00.179
The priest knows what to do.
The church knows what to do.

27:00.180 --> 27:03.496
This is where you find your refuge.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.766
Really, to my surprise,
he was in total agreement.

27:06.767 --> 27:10.870
The priest came up with how to
handle it, how to get rid of...

27:10.871 --> 27:12.305
Through your faith.

27:12.306 --> 27:14.946
- Amen.
- Amen.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.808
And you must use holy water.

27:20.847 --> 27:24.387
This isn't gonna be enough.

27:30.056 --> 27:34.256
So he gave me gallons of holy water.

27:42.936 --> 27:48.836
I spent so much time in my room
by myself that I wanted to breathe.

27:57.984 --> 28:03.884
I loved being outside on the swing
because it took me away from the house.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.660
She became more and more withdrawn.

28:07.661 --> 28:11.081
She spent more time alone.

28:12.265 --> 28:16.644
Well, every five, ten minutes or so,
I would look out and just check on her.

28:16.645 --> 28:20.303
And it wasn't fully lit
back there, so I decided...

28:20.304 --> 28:24.684
To look at the cameras in the backyard.

28:34.955 --> 28:37.289
I wasn't going really high.
I wasn't going really fast.

28:37.290 --> 28:42.662
I just kind of kept a really
steady, consistent pace.

28:42.663 --> 28:44.632
Everything seemed to be all right,

28:44.633 --> 28:49.973
and she was swinging back
and forth, back and forth.

29:06.687 --> 29:08.847
Angela...

29:20.912 --> 29:22.980
I saw these figures.

29:22.981 --> 29:24.247
Oh, Angela.

29:24.248 --> 29:26.984
All of a sudden, I felt
this really heavy push.

29:26.985 --> 29:28.051
Ah!

29:28.052 --> 29:30.092
Crunch!

29:30.622 --> 29:32.482
Mom!

29:32.696 --> 29:36.630
I hit the ground really hard. I
remember hearing this horrible...

29:36.631 --> 29:39.296
Pop. And I knew I broke something.

29:39.297 --> 29:42.057
Somebody help me!

29:42.203 --> 29:44.063
Mom!

29:46.070 --> 29:47.137
Angela!

29:47.138 --> 29:48.506
- Mom!
- Where are you?

29:48.507 --> 29:50.780
- Angela!
- Mom!

29:50.781 --> 29:53.676
And here she was, crying...

29:53.677 --> 29:56.133
Mom, they hurt me.

29:56.134 --> 29:58.749
They're gonna keep hurting me.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.384
We have to leave.

30:00.385 --> 30:04.555
Her ankle was broken in so many places.

30:04.556 --> 30:07.391
I went outside with that holy water.

30:07.392 --> 30:10.895
I threw it all around.
You son of a bitches.

30:10.896 --> 30:15.696
Take me, but this is
not gonna happen again.

30:24.643 --> 30:28.783
Little did I realize that the war...

30:29.240 --> 30:31.214
Was about to begin...

30:31.215 --> 30:35.055
Battling for my daughter's life.

30:44.689 --> 30:47.089
Because I broke my foot,
I spent a lot more time

30:47.090 --> 30:50.434
alone in my room than
I even had before this.

30:50.435 --> 30:52.655
Bye, Ang.

30:52.737 --> 30:54.868
I'm just gonna pick up your meds.

30:54.869 --> 30:59.761
If I had to leave them alone or had to
go somewhere, it was only during the day.

30:59.762 --> 31:03.618
She was incapacitated, so she
knew I was there to run errands.

31:03.619 --> 31:06.275
She was safe, she had
everything she needed.

31:06.276 --> 31:11.016
And, you know, she
could reach me by phone.

31:26.242 --> 31:28.076
It was definitely better during the day.

31:28.077 --> 31:33.977
But when the sun went down, the house
definitely seemed to come more alive.

32:02.144 --> 32:06.947
I started to hear the sound of my
closet door shaking back and forth.

32:06.948 --> 32:09.050
Very softly at first.

32:09.051 --> 32:11.713
It started to look to me
like there was almost somebody

32:11.714 --> 32:17.174
standing on the inside of
my door trying to come out.

32:18.493 --> 32:19.868
No.

32:19.869 --> 32:25.149
It's like a train wreck
when you can't look away.

32:26.401 --> 32:27.401
No!

32:27.402 --> 32:31.772
I saw a black figure that kind
of stepped out of my mirror.

32:31.773 --> 32:32.907
Stay away from me!

32:32.908 --> 32:37.212
What could I do? I couldn't run. I wouldn't
make it to the door. Where can I go?

32:37.213 --> 32:43.113
And the only thing that came to
mind was to jump underneath my bed.

32:44.186 --> 32:47.306
It smelled like death.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.072
Ah!

33:06.031 --> 33:07.846
I grabbed the house
phone, and I brought it

33:07.847 --> 33:12.947
with me underneath the
bed, and I called my mom.

33:18.068 --> 33:21.022
Hi, honey. What's the matter?

33:21.023 --> 33:23.824
- Mom. Mom, he's here! He's in here!
- My God, no!

33:23.825 --> 33:27.461
You could tell she was
frightened beyond belief.

33:27.462 --> 33:29.764
She was so terrified.

33:29.765 --> 33:32.033
I just left everything.

33:32.034 --> 33:34.568
I'm gonna be there any second.

33:34.569 --> 33:37.171
And I'm running to the car.

33:37.172 --> 33:38.689
I'm gonna be home...

33:38.690 --> 33:40.845
And she's trying to tell
me that I need to pray,

33:40.846 --> 33:43.521
and it's gonna take her at
least 45 minutes to get here,

33:43.522 --> 33:46.414
and I'm thinking to myself, I
don't know if I have 45 minutes.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.715
Please come here. Please, mom.

33:47.716 --> 33:51.485
I really felt like he was gonna hurt me.

33:51.486 --> 33:54.022
Stay with me. Just say your prayers.

33:54.023 --> 33:57.091
Hail Mary, full of
Grace. Lord is with...

33:57.092 --> 33:58.426
I'm gonna be home any minute.

33:58.427 --> 34:02.567
Mom. Mom, I'm really, really scared.

34:03.999 --> 34:07.402
Mom! Mommy! He's coming closer!
Mom, he's coming! He's coming!

34:07.403 --> 34:11.183
- Mom, what do I do?
- Angela!

34:21.531 --> 34:23.331
Ah!

34:23.918 --> 34:26.739
Oh, Angela! Honey!

34:27.056 --> 34:31.292
This growl was like nothing
I've ever heard before.

34:31.293 --> 34:33.601
Angela? Angela?

34:33.601 --> 34:37.896
To actually hear it is showing itself...

34:37.897 --> 34:43.417
That's what's in my house
right now with my children?

34:57.404 --> 34:59.305
I open the door...

34:59.306 --> 35:00.840
Nothing. I go...

35:00.841 --> 35:02.318
Angela?

35:02.319 --> 35:04.344
Angela?

35:04.345 --> 35:06.679
I heard nothing.

35:06.680 --> 35:11.804
I went up slowly, and I kept calling
her, going, please, God, let me not...

35:11.805 --> 35:14.019
Let this not be what I think it is.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.060
Angela.

35:16.423 --> 35:21.883
And I just pictured her
ripped apart by this Creature.

35:24.017 --> 35:27.533
I walked in the bedroom door,
and I didn't see anything.

35:27.534 --> 35:29.814
I heard...

35:30.404 --> 35:33.044
It was weeping.

35:33.058 --> 35:36.658
Very faint. She was so weak.

35:37.411 --> 35:40.591
And I said, I'm here.

35:41.615 --> 35:47.075
And I had to pull her out
because she couldn't move.

35:48.155 --> 35:51.575
She was just begging me...

35:52.593 --> 35:54.360
To please make it go away.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.195
It was terrible.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.431
How do you make it go away?

35:58.432 --> 36:00.266
The priest doesn't know.

36:00.267 --> 36:04.827
The holy water is not
cutting it anymore.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.974
Hail Mary, full of Grace...

36:08.975 --> 36:13.513
I worked so hard. This
was for my children.

36:13.514 --> 36:17.183
The money, the time, the
energy... they deserve to be happy.

36:17.184 --> 36:20.064
We deserve a life.

36:20.086 --> 36:22.221
This is not right.

36:22.222 --> 36:27.742
We have had enough tragedy.
We've had enough heartache.

36:28.529 --> 36:31.719
That night, I took my kids to my mom's.

36:31.720 --> 36:37.480
Because I did not want them
staying in that house anymore.

36:42.776 --> 36:44.444
We were at our wit's end.

36:44.445 --> 36:49.349
We call this paranormal investigator.
They'll hopefully know what to do.

36:49.350 --> 36:51.283
I'm sorry to call so late.

36:51.284 --> 36:52.918
I didn't know where else to turn.

36:52.919 --> 36:57.457
I made the phone call to Liz,
the paranormal investigator.

36:57.458 --> 37:00.727
This was, like, 3:00,
4:00 in the morning.

37:00.728 --> 37:03.663
Jeanette I spoke with that
night for about an hour.

37:03.664 --> 37:05.965
I wanted to help her.

37:05.966 --> 37:11.003
Nobody deserves to live in fear
the way Jeanette and the girls did.

37:11.004 --> 37:16.529
They had so much tragedy in
their life with their dad and...

37:16.530 --> 37:22.290
Her husband, and then this
thing creeps in and takes over.

37:23.717 --> 37:25.928
I thought the only
solution at this point was

37:25.929 --> 37:28.976
to do a cleansing and
a blessing on the home.

37:28.977 --> 37:33.237
So I called Dawn Joly, psychic medium.

37:36.029 --> 37:41.534
It was like a heavy... like a heavy
cloud on that whole piece of property.

37:41.535 --> 37:46.893
When Dawn walked through the door,
I could sense she knew instantly...

37:46.894 --> 37:50.434
Where to go, who was there.

37:51.578 --> 37:56.778
She explained that there were
cults that conjured up evil spirits.

37:56.779 --> 38:02.679
Called upon demons, and all this
time, they had been lurking down there.

38:03.290 --> 38:06.560
The demolition disturbed...

38:06.561 --> 38:09.796
All the energy and made an opening.

38:09.797 --> 38:11.659
This was theirs.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.801
No one could be on
that property but them.

38:14.802 --> 38:19.422
It's released something,
something terrible.

38:31.117 --> 38:36.355
The idea is to put salt around
the perimeter of the house.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.591
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.

38:38.592 --> 38:39.792
It's like a force field.

38:39.793 --> 38:42.929
One can't come over,
or one can't come out.

38:42.930 --> 38:47.910
Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those...

38:53.073 --> 38:56.733
Dawn started burning the Sage.

38:56.777 --> 38:59.779
It had to end one way or the other.

38:59.780 --> 39:04.116
You know, it was like
the final conflict for me.

39:04.117 --> 39:08.621
The three of us went down into the
basement, and Dawn had the Sage.

39:08.622 --> 39:09.822
It was filling the air.

39:09.823 --> 39:13.960
Be our protection against the
wickedness and snares of the Devil.

39:13.961 --> 39:17.329
It was a fight as we were going
more and more into the house.

39:17.330 --> 39:21.634
The basement was the
center of all the activity.

39:21.635 --> 39:25.437
And it was so intense down there.

39:25.438 --> 39:28.073
Be our protection
against the wickedness...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.294
I just...

39:31.244 --> 39:37.144
Did what I had to do, but I have
to tell you, I was so frightened.

39:38.605 --> 39:42.325
And all of his evil spirits...

39:42.812 --> 39:45.758
That roam throughout
this world, seeking...

39:45.759 --> 39:51.519
It was like a battle. I heard
chanting. I heard screaming.

39:54.596 --> 40:00.006
Protect us against the wickedness
and the snares of the Devil.

40:00.007 --> 40:04.087
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray.

40:06.346 --> 40:10.486
Back! Back! Satan, gone! Evil spirit!

40:44.931 --> 40:47.733
It burst into flames.

40:47.734 --> 40:50.535
Then as quick as that happened...

40:50.536 --> 40:52.876
It stopped.

40:57.676 --> 41:00.011
That part of the house was wicked.

41:00.012 --> 41:02.592
It really was.

41:14.193 --> 41:17.733
The blessing actually worked.

41:19.966 --> 41:22.267
We still live in the house.

41:22.268 --> 41:25.203
- Good morning.
- Is it okay if we go outside and play?

41:25.204 --> 41:26.638
Of course it is.

41:26.639 --> 41:29.507
- Let's all go.
- Okay.

41:29.508 --> 41:33.779
It was done. It was over.
Everything was gonna be fine.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.217
Now I really do like living there.

41:36.218 --> 41:39.584
My house is full of life.

41:39.585 --> 41:41.147
It was a battle won.

41:41.148 --> 41:45.456
It's not an easy thing to just
make that decision to stay or to go.

41:45.457 --> 41:49.594
And we are still there, but
we've learned, and we've grown.

41:49.595 --> 41:53.915
It changes you. It changes you forever.
