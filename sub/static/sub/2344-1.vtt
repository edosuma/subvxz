01:12.398 --> 01:15.543
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.644
Can I start you guys off with
an order of our freedom tops?

01:27.721 --> 01:30.358
Sarah, you know the
rule about cell phones.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.760
I'm sorry. I just... I was
just checking on something.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.127
Yeah, well check it on your break.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.704
Mario, where has she
been hiding that thing?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.785
Put the car in drive, Charlie.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.622
You're here for one reason
and one reason only

02:01.722 --> 02:04.091
because...

02:04.191 --> 02:06.758
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.933
I stopped going to
church when I was 16.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.634
- So I don't...
- Up, up, up.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.474
I really haven't been able
to take my eyes off of Erin.

03:26.574 --> 03:30.243
The word on the street there's a
rumor going around that she's...

03:30.378 --> 03:34.115
...bicycle but sadly I'm
sitting here realizing

03:34.215 --> 03:35.916
that I've never gone
to take a ride...

03:36.016 --> 03:37.785
Oh, hi, how are you? Good to see you.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.105
- Hey, Sarah. Nice to see you.
- Hello. How's it going?

03:41.206 --> 03:42.690
- I'm glad you came.
- Fine. Yeah.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.861
And I'm glad you brought
your wonderful roommate.

03:46.961 --> 03:50.562
- Suck it, Danny.
- I said you were wonderful.

03:55.202 --> 03:59.807
- You coming?
- Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.143
Oh, don't be coy. You're coming.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.812
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you
all about my new project.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.882
Yeah, it's really good. We've been
working on it for like the last two,

04:07.982 --> 04:09.776
- three months now.
- Cool.

04:09.877 --> 04:12.586
I'm playing Simone. She has the
best lines in the whole thing.

04:12.686 --> 04:18.726
I've been writing it and Erin has been
providing some very insightful feedback.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.629
I am honestly actually kind
of surprised to see you here.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.797
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.699
- Why would you think that?
- Because I "stole your role."

04:29.336 --> 04:32.206
Okay, Danny do you want
to help me in the kitchen?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.374
Yeah.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.810
- I'm kidding, Sarah. Don't worry.
- Okay.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.281
I didn't even know that you auditioned for
it and it was just a stupid commercial.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.583
Honestly, it was kind of a
horrible experience anyway.

04:42.683 --> 04:46.555
The director was a total perv and you
should be glad that you didn't get it.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.190
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.257
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.892
Oh, my God, Sarah.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.661
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.030
Are you coming to Performation?
You totally have to.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.266
- Everyone's going to perform something.
- Oh, perform?

04:59.366 --> 05:03.068
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting
chops that we've heard so much about.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.372
Okay.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.242
I like your shoes, Sarah.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.515
...I'm no ginko but I am Poe.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.578
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film

05:17.679 --> 05:19.620
- but it works great.
- Oh.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.088
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.723
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.391
Danny and I are making a dark room
so we can do all the processing.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.462
That's cool.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.819
Well, we were going to do a gallery
show but it's just so much easier

05:31.920 --> 05:35.067
to put that shit on Instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.306
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.640
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.478
Nip slip.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.074
Sarah.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.881
- Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.285
Hey listen, so about this script
that we were talking about earlier,

06:24.385 --> 06:27.955
I was wondering maybe you and I
could get together sometime and...

06:28.055 --> 06:30.524
Oh, my God.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.728
- What's going on?
- Oh, this ad for a role.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.821
- They just called me in for an audition.
- What? Really?

06:36.922 --> 06:38.387
- That's great. Congratulations.
- No, way, cool.

06:38.487 --> 06:39.433
- That's cool.
- Thank you.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.435
What is the role for?

06:41.535 --> 06:44.638
It's this movie called
The Silver Scream.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.006
Oh, my God. I hope
that's a working title.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.043
- What?
- It's really cool.

06:58.415 --> 07:03.287
Chloe did not get fed
up and just take off.

07:03.657 --> 07:07.028
She's not out on another one of her,

07:08.328 --> 07:09.897
benders.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.433
She's not out on another
one of her benders.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.568
Something happened to her.

07:14.668 --> 07:19.207
I, I went to her...

07:19.907 --> 07:21.706
I... I...

07:22.843 --> 07:26.979
I went over to her trailer and I...

07:29.883 --> 07:31.518
Sorry.

07:32.618 --> 07:36.124
I, I went to...

07:37.024 --> 07:38.727
I...

07:40.327 --> 07:42.394
I went to...

07:43.997 --> 07:45.230
I...

07:53.507 --> 07:55.707
Oh, oh, God.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.749
I'm... I'm...

08:48.495 --> 08:50.362
Sarah Walker.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.102
I'm Sarah Walker.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.243
I'm Sarah Walker.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.310
Hi, Sarah.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.582
I brought a headshot.

09:08.682 --> 09:12.019
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.387
Yeah, of course. I just thought
you might want a hard copy.

09:21.327 --> 09:25.232
What you do in this room right now will
render that headshot null and void.

09:25.932 --> 09:30.771
When you exit this room you will
either have made a lasting impression

09:31.671 --> 09:36.509
or blend into the sea of thousands of
forgotten girls who pass through these halls

09:36.610 --> 09:38.309
every day.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.352
A photograph won't change that.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.495
Okay.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.566
Well, hopefully you'll see something in
me because I know I'd be great for this.

09:59.866 --> 10:05.106
I grew up on scary movies
and I'm an actor obviously.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.777
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.881
Don't tell us, Sarah. Show us.

10:36.162 --> 10:38.732
Chloe didn't get fed up with
the shoot and just take off.

10:38.832 --> 10:40.333
She's not out there on
one of her benders.

10:40.433 --> 10:43.003
- Something happened to her.
- Happened to her, like what?

10:43.103 --> 10:47.273
I went to her trailer after everyone
said that she took off and I found this.

10:47.373 --> 10:50.944
- And?
- Her dad gave her this, Chaz.

10:51.044 --> 10:53.446
On the morning of her birthday
before he left for work

10:53.546 --> 10:56.123
- when he still lived in Long Island.
- So?

10:56.223 --> 11:00.794
So her birthday is September 11. Her dad
died that morning in the World Trade Center.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.776
She would never leave without this.

11:02.877 --> 11:05.399
- No way, not ever.
- Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.266
I mean, that still doesn't
mean something happened.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.029
Well, that's not all.
When I was in her trailer

11:13.130 --> 11:16.843
I-I heard a shuffling and then I saw
something out of the corner of my eye.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.313
Don't say it. Don't tell me you're
believing these stories now too.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.448
I turned. I saw her, Chaz.

11:21.548 --> 11:23.050
- Saw who?
- Chloe.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.119
So she's still here.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.162
It was her...

11:29.863 --> 11:31.822
only it wasn't.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.631
- Thank you, Sarah.
- No problem.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.467
We'll be in touch.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.241
Okay.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.948
Do you have any notes for me?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.651
I can do it again, different if
you didn't like what you saw.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.719
We saw what we needed,
Sarah. Thank you.

12:29.049 --> 12:32.217
Fuck. Fuck. God. Fuck.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.668
Fuck!

12:47.768 --> 12:49.768
God!

14:02.943 --> 14:06.678
Maybe we didn't see all we
needed from you after all.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.919
What was that you were doing
in the washroom, Sarah?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.522
What?

14:15.322 --> 14:17.388
Your fit.

14:19.657 --> 14:22.794
That... that was nothing.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.967
Sarah, you have my attention.

14:34.671 --> 14:38.813
- I was disappointed in myself.
- So you punished yourself.

14:39.913 --> 14:44.117
No, I don't... It's just something
I do. I don't know.

14:44.217 --> 14:48.889
Would you do it again, for us, now?

14:48.989 --> 14:54.027
- What?
- I want to see your fit, Sarah.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.230
I've never done that in
front of anyone before.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.731
Alright then,
thank you for coming in.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.924
Thank you, Sarah. We'll be in touch.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.671
Hey, how'd it go?

17:21.907 --> 17:23.977
How did the audition go?
What happened?

17:25.077 --> 17:29.249
Not good. I think
they made fun of me.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.251
What?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.620
I don't really want to
talk about it right now.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.422
Okay, well, hey,
everyone's coming by in a little bit.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.658
You should come hang out with us.

17:38.758 --> 17:43.294
I kind of want to be alone. Thanks.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.363
Our little tater tot
full of birthing cheer,

18:17.463 --> 18:21.465
our little tater tot
has lived another year.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.136
I love birthdays.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.844
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.354
David, what are you doing
standing there staring at me?

18:41.454 --> 18:45.291
I told you to go defrost those
chicken strips like an hour ago.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.127
They're like a block of ice.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.627
Jesus Christ.

18:50.596 --> 18:54.968
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling
you back. You just called me.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.937
Hello Sarah. Yes, we tried to call...

18:58.037 --> 18:59.716
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.609
- I was...
- Please don't cut me off, Sarah.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.443
We'd like to see you again.

19:07.847 --> 19:11.217
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.120
Great. I'll e-mail you the details.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.524
And Sarah, this will be
different from the last time.

19:18.624 --> 19:23.094
Oh, well good because I only
have so much hair on my head.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.644
Well, thank you. Thank you so much

19:28.745 --> 19:32.269
- and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
- Yeah.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.483
Jeez.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.856
What's going on with you lately?

19:49.956 --> 19:52.959
Listen, Sarah,

19:53.359 --> 19:55.428
Tater's girls are all family.

19:55.528 --> 20:00.768
So, if one of you isn't on the ball
then that affects the whole family.

20:02.368 --> 20:06.006
You would never want to hurt your
family now, would you, Sarah?

20:06.606 --> 20:11.044
- I don't really have a family, Carl.
- I'm talking about your Big Tater's family,

20:11.344 --> 20:15.615
the phone thing, all these
auditions that you're going on.

20:16.215 --> 20:20.820
I know it's important to you but...
this is your job.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.354
You got to prioritize.

20:27.026 --> 20:30.461
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I know that I am.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.665
I think I may have to quit.

20:36.969 --> 20:40.590
No, I don't... You didn't understand
what I was trying to say.

20:40.690 --> 20:45.754
This job is getting in the way,
Carl. I have a talent,

20:46.355 --> 20:49.949
a real talent and I'm not going
to take that for granted anymore.

20:50.049 --> 20:54.420
Now that's... You... You're twisting my
words around and that's not what I meant.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.191
Let me... Let's... Let's start over.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.127
You have a gift. No.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.463
This. This place.

21:03.563 --> 21:10.301
Sarah, there are a million other girls who
would beg for a steady job like this.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.040
I am not a million other girls.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.398
You can go right in.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.671
Close the door behind you.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.514
Step forward please.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.986
Stand right on that pink mark.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.191
It's so dark.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.931
Lower your hand.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.372
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.742
Of course, yeah,
this is my top priority.

22:22.842 --> 22:27.213
Today we'd like to try
something different with you.

22:27.313 --> 22:30.483
Of course. Sure, I...
I didn't get any...

22:30.583 --> 22:34.454
- Would you mind disrobing for us?
- Excuse me?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.689
Would you mind disrobing, please?

22:42.226 --> 22:47.200
The ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?

22:47.300 --> 22:49.402
It doesn't.

22:49.802 --> 22:53.239
Sarah, you've already proven
that you can memorize lines.

22:53.339 --> 22:57.744
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.379
Didn't I do that last time?

23:00.479 --> 23:06.016
That's the reason you're here Sarah,
the only reason you got a call back.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.722
Sarah, you know who we are.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.590
You know the pictures
we've made, yes?

24:00.206 --> 24:03.474
Completely, Sarah.

24:37.576 --> 24:41.378
It's okay, Sarah. I told you
this would be different.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.852
Sarah,

24:46.652 --> 24:48.919
relax yourself.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.561
Sarah, if you can't
fully let yourself go,

24:55.661 --> 24:58.729
how can you ever transform
into something else?

25:56.555 --> 26:01.058
That's what we were looking for,
Sarah. Thank you.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.127
Okay, okay. Here we go.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.230
One, two, three.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.570
If I have to take one more goddamn
photo of you two idiots jumping,

26:44.670 --> 26:46.637
I swear to God I'm
going to kill myself.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.248
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

26:55.348 --> 26:56.416
Hey, how'd it go?

26:56.516 --> 27:01.253
- Tracy told us that you had a callback.
- Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.555
Yeah, I read the ad. The role
seemed a little silly though.

27:05.791 --> 27:09.462
Yeah, but it's Astreus
Pictures so it's legit.

27:09.562 --> 27:12.965
It's Astreus? Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.301
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Good job.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.471
Don't you think it's kind
of a long shot, though?

27:19.271 --> 27:21.307
What's Extra, Extraneous...?

27:21.407 --> 27:23.576
- Astre... Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus. It's stupid.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.479
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.

27:26.579 --> 27:31.083
Fell off a little last few years
but they're coming back?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.652
Maybe you can put in
a word with production,

27:33.752 --> 27:35.888
get a little PA work or something?

27:36.488 --> 27:40.290
- What about our film?
- We're still going to make our film.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.196
Well, I haven't gotten
the role yet. So...

27:44.496 --> 27:46.096
That's true.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.275
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey. Hey.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.511
- How'd it go?
- Great. I think it went great.

27:58.611 --> 27:59.328
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.347
You didn't feel like they were
making fun of you this time?

28:01.447 --> 28:04.583
No, you know what, I don't think they
were making fun of me the first time either.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.853
- Oh, okay. Awesome.
- Yeah.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.788
- Anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.039
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.

28:10.139 --> 28:12.389
Hey, you should go throw on a
bathing suit and come join us.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.160
Oh, shit.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.159
Yo, Erin, Erin.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.570
Shit.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.338
Ashley, here.

28:26.438 --> 28:30.074
Here, here. Here, you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay...

28:34.880 --> 28:39.716
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go
how can you transform into something else?

29:04.176 --> 29:08.348
- Hello?
- I have some good news for you, Sarah.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.983
He wants to meet you.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.085
He, who?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.252
The producer.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.062
Oh, my God.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.749
...this is your moment.
Oh, man.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.457
- I don't know what this is.
- Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.992
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?

29:53.092 --> 29:54.627
Watch what he does.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.630
I'm not trying to be rude
but this is fucking stupid.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.665
Oh, yeah.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.300
That guy rocks.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.068
Do you know how many times I've
wanted to do that? It's crazy.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.349
Wow.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.088
- That's right, you have that thing.
- What thing?

30:23.188 --> 30:26.256
She's got a meeting
with the producer.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.929
- At Astreus?
- Yeah.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.064
I told you you'd get it.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.433
Don't you think you're
a little overdressed?

30:34.533 --> 30:37.670
- This? This is nothing.
- It's a little much.

30:37.770 --> 30:42.239
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.512
Just remember to be yourself in here.

31:40.332 --> 31:41.898
Sarah,

31:43.869 --> 31:47.170
- thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

31:50.776 --> 31:56.982
You're just as beautiful in person
as you are on the audition tapes.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.417
Thank you. I didn't realize
I was being taped.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.656
Well, I am excited, Sarah.

32:04.756 --> 32:09.228
We audition a lot of young
women in this building

32:09.328 --> 32:13.532
but very, very few ever
make it to this room.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.435
Wow, that's great.

32:16.535 --> 32:19.671
Yes, we've had our share of winners,

32:19.771 --> 32:24.076
some pretty big names have
passed right through here,

32:24.176 --> 32:26.543
going way back.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.851
So, did you like our little yarn?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.155
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.

32:36.255 --> 32:40.325
Good. I have high hopes
for this picture.

32:40.425 --> 32:46.132
Yes. It's kind of my love
letter to this town.

32:46.732 --> 32:52.671
Ambition, the blackest
of human desires.

32:52.771 --> 32:57.509
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?

32:57.609 --> 32:59.578
That's what intrigues me.

32:59.678 --> 33:03.749
That's what lights me up as they say.

33:03.849 --> 33:06.485
There's something primal they're

33:06.585 --> 33:10.289
and that's why you're sitting
right here in this room.

33:10.389 --> 33:15.027
- But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
- Of course.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.564
The two are not mutually exclusive.

33:18.664 --> 33:24.202
This industry is a plague Sarah,
a plague of unoriginality,

33:24.302 --> 33:27.639
hollow be thy name,
shallow be thy name.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.809
Yes, it's a plague alright.

33:30.909 --> 33:34.847
And what does every
plague have a lot of?

33:34.947 --> 33:37.082
- Rats?
- Precisely.

33:37.182 --> 33:40.252
Yes, thousands of them,
hungry little rats,

33:40.352 --> 33:42.387
hungry for the cheese.

33:42.487 --> 33:46.492
You cut through the fog of this town

33:46.592 --> 33:48.994
and you get desperation,

33:49.094 --> 33:54.967
plastic parishioners worshiping
their deity of debauchery.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.803
But that's what I find
interesting, Sarah.

33:57.903 --> 34:02.107
That's what I want
to capture in this film,

34:02.207 --> 34:06.745
the ugliness of the human spirit.

34:06.845 --> 34:10.483
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.

34:11.183 --> 34:14.386
So why do you do it, darling?

34:14.886 --> 34:17.255
Why, why do I do what?

34:17.856 --> 34:21.056
Why do you pull your
beautiful hair out?

34:26.262 --> 34:29.001
I... It's just a habit.

34:29.101 --> 34:32.503
I started doing it when
I was a little girl and...

34:34.003 --> 34:36.909
it helps me focus on the moment.

34:37.009 --> 34:39.110
The moment.

34:39.210 --> 34:43.081
- Well, this is a moment.
- Yes, yes it is.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.884
The role of Celeste
is a really big deal

34:45.984 --> 34:49.922
for a young actress with no
other credits to her name.

34:50.022 --> 34:53.585
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall,

34:53.686 --> 34:57.729
a wall in the lobby,
a lobby of a movie theater,

34:57.829 --> 35:01.600
a theater with a marquee,

35:01.700 --> 35:04.803
The Silver Scream.

35:04.903 --> 35:09.141
Now you know that doesn't happen
very much anymore, right?

35:09.441 --> 35:12.444
This is a great opportunity
for a young actress,

35:12.544 --> 35:16.882
a great opportunity for
an actress with ambition.

35:16.982 --> 35:22.387
That's me. I'm your girl. I will do
whatever it takes for this role.

35:22.487 --> 35:27.059
Good, because we want
to offer it to you.

35:27.659 --> 35:30.429
We think you could be
great in this role, Sarah.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.296
I think you could be
great in this role.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.973
I agree. Truthfully,
I think I am this role.

35:41.073 --> 35:46.612
I mean, this character has a dream
and she has so much potential.

35:46.712 --> 35:50.482
Sarah, forget about all that.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.952
This world is about the doers,

35:54.052 --> 35:56.888
the people who don't just talk
about what they're going to do,

35:56.988 --> 36:00.724
they just do it. And that's you.

36:04.029 --> 36:07.132
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

36:07.232 --> 36:10.636
I worked so hard, you know.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.871
Every week is a new class,

36:12.971 --> 36:16.740
a new audition and I just never...

36:22.410 --> 36:27.383
If you want me to...
to read more with...

36:28.284 --> 36:30.022
other actors,

36:32.722 --> 36:34.426
or another audition.

36:34.526 --> 36:39.531
Sarah, this is the audition.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.768
I told you before,

36:42.868 --> 36:47.339
very, very few actresses
ever get to this room.

36:47.439 --> 36:51.009
Sarah, you're at the gates.

36:51.109 --> 36:55.614
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.750
I can make you a star, Sarah.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.718
- You know I can.
- Whoa, no.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.856
Let me out.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.894
Let me out. Open the door.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.190
How'd it go?

37:38.590 --> 37:40.259
Not good.

37:40.659 --> 37:44.162
- Maybe I should submit my headshot.
- Seriously.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.964
I'm kidding.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.200
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.366
Hey.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.203
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.905
It was a fucking joke.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.843
Coming in.

38:07.386 --> 38:11.154
What are you doing? Hey,

38:13.758 --> 38:16.226
don't cry, hun.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.431
What happened?

38:19.831 --> 38:23.001
Everything was going so well.

38:23.101 --> 38:26.338
I was so sure I was going to get it.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.508
I quit my job for this.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.010
You quit your job for this?

38:32.110 --> 38:35.614
I was so sure. I was so sure.

38:35.714 --> 38:39.384
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?

38:39.684 --> 38:43.088
It was one final step

38:43.588 --> 38:48.691
and I could have had it
too if I was just willing to...

38:51.196 --> 38:53.663
Hun, willing to what?

38:56.535 --> 38:59.605
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.741
I mean, he didn't say
specifically what.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.677
Oh, my God.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.679
Are you being serious?

39:07.979 --> 39:12.051
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?

39:12.651 --> 39:15.287
Well, no one out there does.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.656
And I sure as heck don't.

39:18.256 --> 39:21.325
And you don't. Okay?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.998
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.866
Wait,

39:30.267 --> 39:33.839
you don't wish that
you did it do you?

39:34.539 --> 39:37.210
It was a gateway part.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.279
Sarah, it was two auditions.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.249
I mean, and seriously, who gets
hired for a lead role that quickly?

39:44.349 --> 39:47.050
Doesn't that seem a
little suspicious to you?

39:49.554 --> 39:54.025
Listen, Danny was just telling me how
badly he wants to have you in his movie.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.427
You should talk to him.

39:55.527 --> 39:56.859
Oh, shut up.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.364
What are they up to now?

40:13.278 --> 40:16.581
I can make you a star, Sarah.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.315
You know I can.

40:26.992 --> 40:31.096
So I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.766
I know that you were
trying to help me

40:34.866 --> 40:38.637
and I twisted your words.

40:39.537 --> 40:42.705
I twisted them and...

40:43.675 --> 40:47.412
Look, Sarah, I get it.

40:47.512 --> 40:51.483
Really, I do. I'm not an idiot.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.017
I know what town we live in.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.722
I mean, you think you're the
first waitress I've ever had

40:57.822 --> 41:00.358
that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.694
But they all understood
that being a Taters girl

41:02.794 --> 41:06.398
is what paid the bills while
they chased the dream.

41:06.498 --> 41:10.867
Now I'm not sure you see
how the two are connected.

41:14.339 --> 41:17.943
I mean, I don't know what
else you want me to say.

41:18.043 --> 41:21.546
Do you want me to beg for this job?

41:21.646 --> 41:24.349
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like,

41:24.449 --> 41:27.400
- 20 applications since you quit, so...
- I'm sorry. I didn't...

41:27.501 --> 41:29.589
I didn't mean it like that.

41:30.789 --> 41:36.229
Look, I want you to see this
place for what it really is.

41:37.529 --> 41:40.632
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.902
Too self-aware,
not ironic enough for you,

41:44.002 --> 41:47.505
the menus, the specials,
all those clever meal names,

41:47.605 --> 41:49.341
calling the little kids tater tots,

41:49.441 --> 41:53.678
saying see you later tater gator
when the customers are leaving.

41:53.778 --> 41:57.983
That's all me. All right?

41:58.283 --> 42:03.538
It may not be cool to a
young woman your age

42:03.639 --> 42:06.659
- but it's me.
- Okay.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.070
Look, just...

42:10.871 --> 42:14.165
promise me that until your star
is on the sidewalk out there

42:14.265 --> 42:19.105
you'll try and value me and
what I'm trying to do here.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.438
Can you...

42:23.475 --> 42:25.775
Can you do that for me?

42:27.445 --> 42:30.046
Are you a Taters girl?

42:32.350 --> 42:34.350
Yeah, I can do that.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.790
I'm a Taters girl.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.748
I guess my point is that I just feel
like, the austerity lifestyles,

43:03.848 --> 43:06.449
sort of eastern lifestyles exists...

43:10.054 --> 43:14.359
I got no friends at my party.

43:14.459 --> 43:17.929
Hey. Back to slumming
it like the rest of us?

43:18.029 --> 43:19.495
Hey.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.566
Hey.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.735
- What's up, Erin?
- Hi.

43:23.835 --> 43:25.368
What's up?

43:26.871 --> 43:29.105
Do you have like, an amp for that?

43:38.550 --> 43:40.049
This is good.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.238
Who knows how to scat?

43:44.338 --> 43:48.526
This is the issue with the millennial
generation. It's just, it's entitlement.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.341
Hey, you get off my lawn.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.878
It's my property you're sitting on.

44:06.978 --> 44:10.349
You're loitering. I could
have you arrested.

44:10.849 --> 44:14.851
It's a crime. It's where I live.

44:15.954 --> 44:19.190
- You live there?
- Yeah.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.426
Why?

44:21.526 --> 44:24.095
See, it's LA.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.765
Why should I spend $1500
a month on an apartment

44:26.865 --> 44:30.702
when I'm just going to spend
all day in the car anyway?

44:30.802 --> 44:34.972
- So this is your car too?
- It's my car. It doesn't run but...

44:35.072 --> 44:37.206
it did when I had that epiphany.

44:50.555 --> 44:53.492
Tracy told us what happened.

44:54.592 --> 44:56.861
Told you, told you what?

44:56.961 --> 45:02.932
That the producer at
Astreus got inappropriate.

45:07.105 --> 45:09.138
Maybe it's worth it.

45:12.510 --> 45:16.281
I just started back up
at Big Taters yesterday.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.883
I kind of feel like I'm
selling my soul already.

45:18.983 --> 45:22.585
So it may as well be
for something I love.

45:25.957 --> 45:30.595
I don't know. If you want to do
what you love, why not just do it?

45:30.895 --> 45:35.367
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters. I live in a van.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.470
So what?

45:39.170 --> 45:43.539
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from
us being able to do what we want to do.

45:45.977 --> 45:48.948
We got all these people,
all our friends,

45:50.348 --> 45:52.550
they're just sitting around
trying to figure out what to do,

45:52.650 --> 45:55.687
trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.

45:55.787 --> 45:59.922
Maybe we should just get
together and make something.

46:03.962 --> 46:07.532
I'm going to send you my script.

46:07.632 --> 46:10.499
You're going to dig it, trust me.

46:12.971 --> 46:16.639
And we'll work around your
precious Big Taters schedule.

46:20.845 --> 46:23.215
You'd direct me?

46:23.715 --> 46:25.248
Yeah.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.587
I'd be your leading lady?

46:29.687 --> 46:31.189
I say rape, you say don't.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.356
- Sure.
- Simone?

46:38.396 --> 46:40.596
If you want.

46:44.168 --> 46:46.235
Then, yeah.

46:47.538 --> 46:51.607
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'll be in your movie.

46:53.511 --> 46:55.880
Alright, okay.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.116
I've been trying to talk to
you about it for a week.

46:58.216 --> 47:01.787
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.

47:02.387 --> 47:04.520
All right?

47:05.356 --> 47:07.456
Do you have any champagne?

47:11.029 --> 47:12.561
Okay. Hold on.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.178
What is it?

47:32.784 --> 47:35.618
It's the start of the night
we're never going to forget.

47:46.164 --> 47:48.764
Three, two, one.

49:16.354 --> 49:19.857
This world is about the doers,

49:19.957 --> 49:25.130
the people who don't just talk about what
they're going to do, they just do it.

49:25.730 --> 49:27.296
And that's you.

49:31.836 --> 49:33.938
Astreus Pictures.

49:34.038 --> 49:37.409
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.

49:37.909 --> 49:41.642
I made a mistake. I never
should have left that office.

49:44.916 --> 49:47.149
I want to meet him again.

50:02.967 --> 50:07.102
582 Canyon Drive.
Be there in one hour.

51:21.212 --> 51:23.045
Come in, Sarah.

51:44.201 --> 51:47.136
There won't be a third
opportunity, Sarah.

52:09.293 --> 52:11.761
Your house is beautiful.

52:15.732 --> 52:18.901
Do you want me to read a scene?

52:25.740 --> 52:29.378
Do you want to discuss
the role some more?

52:41.025 --> 52:46.029
I'm sorry that I left
the other night. I'm...

52:46.429 --> 52:51.900
I'm... I... I really could
be great for this part.

52:53.404 --> 52:58.743
Words, Sarah, just words.

52:58.843 --> 53:03.481
What would you be willing
to do to convince me,

53:03.581 --> 53:07.084
to make me believe in you again?

53:07.184 --> 53:12.189
Would you forgo your eyes
for a new pair of eyes,

53:12.289 --> 53:15.459
eyes that see with our vision?

53:15.559 --> 53:18.429
Would you give up your body

53:19.029 --> 53:22.466
to become a vessel for our voice,

53:22.566 --> 53:25.303
for my voice?

53:25.403 --> 53:32.708
Will you give your old life
away for a glorious, new life?

53:35.879 --> 53:37.746
Yes.

53:39.683 --> 53:41.817
Then show me.

54:28.199 --> 54:31.402
The gateway is opened, Sarah.

54:31.502 --> 54:38.075
All you have to do is be willing
to step inside forever

54:38.375 --> 54:41.243
and never look back.

54:42.413 --> 54:45.285
Kill your old life, Sarah.

54:46.085 --> 54:49.193
Bury it in the earth

54:49.594 --> 54:54.158
and join us in the skies.

55:00.364 --> 55:03.599
Show me the girl I thought you were.

55:09.940 --> 55:13.609
Let me see the real, Sarah.

56:17.841 --> 56:19.875
Sarah, order's up.

56:25.416 --> 56:28.183
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.

56:29.620 --> 56:32.256
Go home. You shouldn't
be here right now.

56:32.356 --> 56:34.859
No, no, it's... I'm fine. It's fine.

56:34.959 --> 56:39.396
It's not fine. What are you doing?
Come here. Come on. Come on.

56:39.496 --> 56:41.599
Come on, come on.
Give me it. Give me it.

56:41.699 --> 56:44.533
Give me that. Give me it.
Give me it. Give me it.

56:53.978 --> 56:57.179
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

57:07.157 --> 57:09.191
Astreus Pictures.

57:10.127 --> 57:12.229
This is Sarah Walker calling.

57:16.129 --> 57:18.836
I'm not feeling very well.

57:19.136 --> 57:21.705
I mean, I'm fine.

57:21.805 --> 57:23.942
It's fine. I just...

57:25.042 --> 57:29.313
I don't... I don't know
what's happening right now.

57:29.413 --> 57:33.415
So if someone could...

57:37.121 --> 57:41.359
If someone could please call me
back when you get this, please.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.259
Thank you.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.273
Are you okay?

57:59.810 --> 58:01.476
Are you alright?

58:03.013 --> 58:07.351
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you. Come here.

58:07.451 --> 58:10.786
Hey, are you okay?
You alright, Sarah?

58:13.757 --> 58:16.794
- Danny, get drunk with me.
- I'm alright right now, man.

58:16.894 --> 58:18.696
But I love you. I love you very much.

58:18.796 --> 58:21.565
Suit yourself but we won't be able
to sneak booze into the bowl.

58:21.665 --> 58:26.704
It easy to sneak booze in. All you have
to do is flirt with the dude at the door.

58:26.804 --> 58:29.971
Oh. Yeah, yeah,
I'll give that a shot.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.474
Dude.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.479
She's going to Ralph.

58:35.579 --> 58:37.815
Hey, I think maybe we
need to get her home.

58:37.915 --> 58:40.785
Get her like some water or something.

58:41.585 --> 58:44.788
- Yo, Poe, put that away.
- No, no, no, this is golden.

58:44.888 --> 58:47.691
I'm going to make a Tumblr. It's going
to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.

58:47.791 --> 58:50.127
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?

58:50.227 --> 58:52.396
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you. It's okay.

58:52.496 --> 58:54.031
Give me my fucking phone!

58:54.131 --> 58:55.530
- Whoa!
- Jesus.

58:58.769 --> 59:00.535
Dude.

59:02.773 --> 59:06.641
Sarah? What the... I was
trying to stop him. What...

59:07.678 --> 59:09.913
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.

59:10.013 --> 59:11.081
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?

59:11.181 --> 59:13.984
- Why are you defending her, Danny?
- Go after her. She's sick.

59:14.084 --> 59:15.886
Sarah, you shouldn't go
down there. It's not safe.

59:15.986 --> 59:17.254
Go after her. She's going to...

59:17.354 --> 59:18.856
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...

59:18.956 --> 59:21.289
I mean it. She's obviously
not feeling well.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.572
Astreus Pictures.

59:37.674 --> 59:39.441
Hello?

59:40.611 --> 59:42.444
Hello?

59:48.786 --> 59:52.721
I don't feel good. I don't feel...

59:55.425 --> 59:57.528
Hello?!

59:57.828 --> 01:00:00.195
I did what you asked.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.239
Hey, you okay?

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:16.812
How dare you! How dare
you touch me! How dare you!

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:34.095
I'm sorry.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:51.184
Sarah, if you can't really let
yourself go how can you ever transform

01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:53.751
- into something else?
- You're at the gates.

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:58.055
All you need is for me
to open them for you.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.625
Maybe we didn't see what we
needed from you after all.

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.560
Your face would be on the poster,

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.064
the poster on the wall,
a wall in a lobby,

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.333
the lobby of the movie theater,

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.702
a theater with a marquee.

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:14.138
They are all losers. Cancer.

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:16.874
Kill your old life, Sarah.

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:20.009
Bury it in the earth

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:25.346
and join us in the skies.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:35.123
Sarah? You okay?

01:01:36.393 --> 01:01:38.295
Go away.

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:41.229
Listen, I really need
to get in there.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:48.172
I... Just go away please.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:51.473
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.198
Are you okay?

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.503
Sweetie, what...?

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:31.048
Do you smell that?

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:34.852
I think it's coming from you.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.854
Yeah,

01:02:36.954 --> 01:02:43.493
Sarah, no offense,
but I mean, that's you.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.963
- Are you on your period?
- What?

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.899
Fuck you. All right,
that's enough, okay.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.035
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.135
You told them.

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:56.573
- You told them.
- Who? What?

01:02:56.673 --> 01:03:00.278
About my audition. And the producer,

01:03:00.879 --> 01:03:02.596
- right?
- It came...

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.882
I bet you all got
off on it too, right?

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:08.185
- No.
- Seeing me fail like that?

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.755
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:14.625
They're your friends!
They're your friends!

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:17.294
I am trying to do something big.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:21.031
I'm trying to do
something with my life.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.500
How am I supposed to do this

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.556
when you surround me with these...

01:03:26.857 --> 01:03:28.505
losers?

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.910
Do you hear the words that are
coming out of your mouth right now?

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:37.080
They're like venom to me,

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:41.785
like, like a cancer, all of
you guys, just all of you.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:47.190
You and Danny, Erin,
just like, living off of me.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.026
Oh, living off of you?

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:53.330
Okay, the last time I checked I covered
your rent for the past two months

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.405
and I'm guessing you don't
have this month's either because

01:03:55.506 --> 01:03:58.568
you're so obsessed with this job
that just wants to fuck you

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.836
instead of the job that
actually pays your bills.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.633
What the fuck?

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:05.133
Now it's our apartment again. So do
me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:21.483
Sarah.

01:05:28.423 --> 01:05:30.658
Don't fight it.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:38.333
Sleep now, Sarah. We want
to show you something.

01:06:33.257 --> 01:06:35.693
I hope that's a working title.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:40.295
- Are you sure you really...
- Danny was just talking about it...

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.102
Maybe we get to see the acting chops
that we've heard so much about.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.371
- Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
- Tracey told us what happened.

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:50.505
He was just telling me...

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:53.808
You know what you have to do.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:43.431
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.735
I'm dying.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:54.344
- I'm dying.
- Yes, you are.

01:11:54.444 --> 01:12:00.114
You can go into the ground to be
forgotten forever or you can be reborn.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:07.524
Did you expect it to be painless,
that it would be easy,

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:09.359
that you'd simply wake up one morning

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:13.864
with everything you ever
wanted laid out before you?

01:12:14.264 --> 01:12:16.765
I told you Sarah,

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:20.737
dreams require sacrifice.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.173
And so do we.

01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:26.609
I can give you what you want Sarah,

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:31.781
but you need to embrace
who you really are.

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:36.219
It's time to become one of us.

01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:40.788
It's time to be remembered.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.601
Grab something.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.543
Hit him.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.167
I can't get over
comfortable your bed is.

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:33.236
More comfortable than
the five year old futon

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:35.903
you've been dragging
around since college?

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.742
I got to pee.

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:46.449
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:49.185
and a treat,
a little special something.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:50.885
Okay.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:51.512
- Bravo.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:56.086
Sarah?

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:59.556
You scared the shit out of me.

01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:01.455
Don't!

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:08.729
Sarah, what are you doing here?

01:16:10.466 --> 01:16:14.637
You let him put that
revolting thing in you.

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:18.274
And then he gives you
the role of Simone back.

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.741
You were watching us?

01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:27.551
You think I had to fuck Danny
to get a role in his movie?

01:16:28.851 --> 01:16:33.357
That's sad that you see
the world like that.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:38.962
Sarah, you know that me and Danny
have hooked up before, right?

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:42.864
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe we just like each other?

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.774
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:53.410
You know what's sad?

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.476
You.

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:59.246
All of you.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:05.556
A role in Danny's
little film, how sad.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:11.294
What's sadder is that you
think I want any of it,

01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:13.461
that I'd sink so low.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:18.968
Right. Why would you have
to fuck Danny for her role

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:23.107
when you've already fucked
some big time movie producer?

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:29.577
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack
of cash from Astreus Pictures.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.386
Oh, my God,

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.088
Sarah, did you...

01:17:39.188 --> 01:17:43.359
Did you actually suck
some old producer's cock

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:47.729
for a role in a movie
called The Silver Scream?

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.307
That's sad.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.443
It's a gateway part.

01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:02.378
From here it sounds
a lot like prostitution.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:03.678
Don't!

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.688
- Sarah, what happened to you?
- Don't, don't touch me.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:12.789
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:13.890
- Sarah.
- Don't.

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.958
Stop it, stop it.

01:18:15.058 --> 01:18:19.193
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no, get off me.

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:07.574
It feels good.

01:19:12.582 --> 01:19:15.950
See what happens
when you stop fighting?

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:20.390
Trust us, Sarah.

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:23.190
Don't hurt yourself.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.862
Let us in. Embrace who you are.

01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.492
What's up?

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:29.470
Sarah?

01:23:32.374 --> 01:23:34.241
What are you doing here?

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:41.748
Hey, did you see Erin?

01:23:43.252 --> 01:23:46.720
Yeah. We talked.

01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.894
Okay, what did you talk about?

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.727
You.

01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:57.064
Right.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:05.977
Did she tell you how
worried we are about you?

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:10.814
Since you ran off the other night?

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:15.386
You know, Tracy came by here,
she said the two of you had a big fight.

01:24:17.186 --> 01:24:19.319
We're all pretty concerned.

01:24:26.262 --> 01:24:29.353
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on...

01:24:32.254 --> 01:24:34.267
we can help you.

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:37.775
You know, just talk to me.

01:24:39.475 --> 01:24:41.358
You,

01:24:42.059 --> 01:24:43.944
help me?

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.217
Yeah.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:55.425
Yeah, I'm your friend.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.459
No, you're not.

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:01.728
None of you are.

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.667
Sarah, of course we are.

01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:10.904
Sarah?

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.608
Jesus, what's wrong
with you? Are you...?

01:25:27.056 --> 01:25:29.289
I don't have any friends.

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.633
Wait! Don't!

01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:43.537
Sarah, don't, don't.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.510
Why, why?

01:25:53.048 --> 01:25:56.787
There's only one thing in
this whole world that I want

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:01.054
and they're going to give it to me.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.633
They see the real me.

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:43.490
Yes.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:50.799
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:54.234
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:57.940
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.241
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:04.613
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:07.950
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:11.585
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.857
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:18.260
Hail Astreus. Hail Astreus.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.896
Hail Astreus. Hail...

01:28:20.996 --> 01:28:24.965
She is ready to transform.

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:32.699
Sarah?

01:29:35.104 --> 01:29:37.370
Sarah, are you here?

01:29:44.313 --> 01:29:46.012
Sarah?

01:29:47.182 --> 01:29:49.115
Are you in there?

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:54.454
Sarah?

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.097
All right, this is just weird.

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:04.130
And a fire hazard.

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:10.937
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

01:30:12.374 --> 01:30:16.062
I shouldn't have told everyone what
happened. That's your business.

01:30:16.162 --> 01:30:20.480
If you wanted them to know then
well you would've told them.

01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:28.254
Anyway, I needed to say that.

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:32.859
Hey, are you okay in there?

01:30:42.738 --> 01:30:44.538
You're hurting me.

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:53.950
Your eyes. You told everyone.

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:57.019
Lie down next to me.

01:30:57.119 --> 01:31:02.091
Come lie next to me,
Trace, like old times.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.458
I don't want to do that.

01:31:06.662 --> 01:31:08.698
Come to me.

01:31:09.498 --> 01:31:13.200
We're all alone. There's nothing.

01:31:23.178 --> 01:31:25.945
Things are changing for me, Trace.

01:31:27.049 --> 01:31:28.483
That's good.

01:31:29.783 --> 01:31:31.951
I'm happy for you.

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:35.455
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:31:37.526 --> 01:31:41.261
Where... are you going?

01:31:45.367 --> 01:31:47.701
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
