I'LL SAVE YOU."

00:19.959 --> 00:22.042
Kaz: LOOK.

TO THE SCHOOL CARNIVAL TONIGHT.

00:28.083 --> 00:31.918

SHE'S THE MOST POPULAR

00:31.959 --> 00:34.209
GIRL IN SCHOOL!

00:34.250 --> 00:35.918
YOU HAVE NO SHOT WITH HER.

00:35.959 --> 00:39.334
YES, I DO.

00:35.959 --> 00:39.334
WE SHARED A MOMENT TODAY.

00:39.375 --> 00:42.500
SHE LEANED OVER AND SAID,

00:39.375 --> 00:42.500
"IS THAT YOU THAT

00:39.375 --> 00:42.500
SMELLS LIKE THAT?"

00:42.542 --> 00:45.042
AND I SAID, "NO,

00:42.542 --> 00:45.042
IT'S  NOT </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> ME.</font>

00:45.083 --> 00:47.292

00:47.334 --> 00:50.000
WELL, I KNOW YOU'VE HAD

00:47.334 --> 00:50.000
A CRUSH ON HER FOREVER.

00:50.042 --> 00:52.459
SO GO FOR IT.

00:50.042 --> 00:52.459
I'LL BE RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE.

00:52.500 --> 00:57.500
THANKS, BUDDY.

00:52.500 --> 00:57.500
CAPTURING EVERY PAINFUL AND

00:52.500 --> 00:57.500
HUMILIATING MOMENT ON VIDEO.

00:57.542 --> 01:00.000

01:02.125 --> 01:04.542
UH, STEPHANIE? HI.

01:04.584 --> 01:08.167

01:09.667 --> 01:13.918
UH, GREAT. MAYBE--MAYBE

HA HA HA!

01:26.417 --> 01:28.959
OF COURSE IT WAS A JOKE.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.209
WHY WOULD I ASK YOU

01:29.000 --> 01:31.209
OUT ON A DATE? I--

01:31.250 --> 01:34.542
I-I ALREADY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

02:19.083 --> 02:23.125
TERRIFIC. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO

02:19.083 --> 02:23.125

02:23.167 --> 02:25.626
SO STEPHANIE DOESN'T THINK

02:23.167 --> 02:25.626
I'M A TOTAL LOSER.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.167
THIS IS A DISASTER.

TOAST! TOAST!

03:30.542 --> 03:32.792
HEY, SKYLAR.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.792
STILL NO HEAT VISION?

03:32.834 --> 03:35.751
NO. I'M SO SICK OF

03:32.834 --> 03:35.751
BEING IN THIS HOSPITAL.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.167
I'M BOUNCING

03:35.792 --> 03:38.167
OFF THE WALLS HERE!

03:35.792 --> 03:38.167
LITERALLY.

03:38.209 --> 03:40.542
I TRIED USING MY POWERS

03:38.209 --> 03:40.542

BOUNCING OFF.

03:42.584 --> 03:45.584
HEY, UH, WHY DON'T YOU

03:42.584 --> 03:45.584
HANG OUT WITH US?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.292
THERE'S THIS CARNIVAL

03:45.626 --> 03:48.292
AT OUR SCHOOL.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.292
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY COME.

03:48.334 --> 03:51.667
I DON'T KNOW.

03:48.334 --> 03:51.667
I'VE NEVER SPENT ANY TIME

03:48.334 --> 03:51.667
IN THE NORMAL WORLD.

03:51.709 --> 03:55.334
I MEAN, I JUST

03:51.709 --> 03:55.334
FLY IN FROM MY PLANET,

03:51.709 --> 03:55.334
SAVE HUMANITY, AND FLY OUT.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.667
AT MOST, I'LL STOP

03:55.375 --> 03:57.667
FOR A SOFT PRETZEL.

03:59.417 --> 04:00.834
I WON'T FIT IN AT YOUR SCHOOL.

04:00.876 --> 04:03.584
JUST LIKE I DON'T FIT IN

04:00.876 --> 04:03.584
IN THE SUPERHERO WORLD ANYMORE.

04:03.626 --> 04:06.375
OH, COME ON.

04:03.626 --> 04:06.375
IT'S JUST WHAT YOU NEED--

04:06.417 --> 04:09.042
FOR YOU AND YOUR BEST INTERESTS.

04:09.083 --> 04:12.626
HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

04:09.083 --> 04:12.626
OR--OR MY BEST INTERESTS.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.334
AT ALL!

04:14.375 --> 04:17.291
I COULD USE A BREAK

04:14.375 --> 04:17.291
FROM MIGHTY MED.

04:17.334 --> 04:20.541
KAZ, CAN I TALK TO YOU

04:17.334 --> 04:20.541
IN PRIVATE?

04:23.751 --> 04:25.584
KAZ, THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

04:25.626 --> 04:28.334
WHAT? WHY?

04:25.626 --> 04:28.334
I NEED A FAKE GIRLFRIEND,

04:28.375 --> 04:30.709
SKYLAR WANTS TO

04:28.375 --> 04:30.709
GET OUT OF HERE--

04:28.375 --> 04:30.709
IT'S PERFECT.

04:30.751 --> 04:34.751
LOOK, SHE JUST LOST HER POWERS

04:30.751 --> 04:34.751
AND SHE'S ALREADY FEELING

04:30.751 --> 04:34.751
VULNERABLE AND OUT OF PLACE.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.709
YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME!

04:39.334 --> 04:42.542
ALTHOUGH SHE COULD USE

04:39.334 --> 04:42.542
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

04:42.584 --> 04:44.375
FINE.

04:44.417 --> 04:47.375
SKYLAR, YOU ARE

04:44.417 --> 04:47.375
COMIN' WITH US.

04:47.417 --> 04:50.042
GOOD, BECAUSE ANYPLACE

04:47.417 --> 04:50.042
IS BETTER THAN THIS.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.751
EXCEPT THE LAVA PITS

04:50.083 --> 04:52.751
OF KELNAR.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.042
THE LINES THERE

04:52.792 --> 04:55.042
ARE  SO </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> LONG.</font>

04:55.083 --> 04:59.125

04:55.083 --> 04:59.125
THE REAL SKYLAR STORM.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.792
HMM. I'LL JUST USE

04:59.167 --> 05:01.792
THE MOST POPULAR

04:59.167 --> 05:01.792
GIRL'S NAME FROM MY PLANET:

05:01.834 --> 05:04.584
AIYEE-EEKI-EEKI-WAA.

05:06.667 --> 05:10.334
OR </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> YOU COULD JUST USE...</font>

05:10.375 --> 05:12.918
CONNIE VALENTINE.

05:12.959 --> 05:18.709
OKAY, BUT IT DOESN'T

05:12.959 --> 05:18.709
ROLL OFF THE TONGUE

05:12.959 --> 05:18.709
LIKE AIYEE-EEKI-EEKI-WAA.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.542
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.542
WHAT'S THE SECOND MOST POPULAR

05:18.751 --> 05:22.542
NAME ON YOUR PLANET?

05:22.584 --> 05:24.000
"EMILY."

05:29.584 --> 05:31.250
( monitor beeping )

05:31.292 --> 05:33.334
TITANIO'S COMING TO!

05:42.876 --> 05:46.667
CUT OUT TO BE A DOCTOR.

05:46.709 --> 05:47.709
( sighs )

05:47.751 --> 05:49.667
TITANIO,

05:47.751 --> 05:49.667
YOU SUFFERED A CONCUSSION

05:49.709 --> 05:51.083
BATTLING THE BLACK FALCON.

05:51.125 --> 05:54.292
FORTUNATELY, THE NEURO-LINK

05:51.125 --> 05:54.292
TO YOUR ARMORED EXO-SUIT

05:54.334 --> 05:57.209
SEEMS TO BE INTACT,

05:54.334 --> 05:57.209
BUT YOU HAVE A CASE

05:54.334 --> 05:57.209
OF AMNESIA.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.834
I CAN FIX HIM!

05:58.876 --> 06:02.375
I CAN JOG HIS MEMORY

05:58.876 --> 06:02.375
BY SMACKING HIM WITH

05:58.876 --> 06:02.375
A FRYING PAN!

06:02.417 --> 06:04.834
YOU CAN'T SMACK SOMEONE

06:02.417 --> 06:04.834
WITH A FRYING PAN--

06:04.876 --> 06:07.626
WITHOUT YEARS

06:04.876 --> 06:07.626
OF MEDICAL TRAINING.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.667
I REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER

06:07.667 --> 06:10.667
MUCH OF ANYTHING.

06:10.709 --> 06:13.083
WHY AM I WEARING THIS SUIT?

06:13.125 --> 06:15.250
I WONDER WHAT

06:13.125 --> 06:15.250
THIS BLUE BUTTON DOES?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.334
WELL, AT LEAST WE FIGURED OUT

06:20.667 --> 06:23.334
WHAT THAT BLUE BUTTON DOES.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.834
IT HAS THE POWER

06:23.375 --> 06:25.834
TO SILENCE MY NEPHEW.

06:27.751 --> 06:29.751
I WONDER WHAT

06:27.751 --> 06:29.751
THIS BLUE BUTTON DOES?

06:32.709 --> 06:36.459
"SHORT-TERM MEMORY

06:32.709 --> 06:36.459
DELIGHTFULLY IMPAIRED."

06:40.709 --> 06:44.584
I'M SO NERVOUS.

06:40.709 --> 06:44.584
I REALLY WANT TO FIT IN

06:40.709 --> 06:44.584
AS A NORMO.

06:44.626 --> 06:47.167
I'M SO SELF-CONSCIOUS.

06:44.626 --> 06:47.167
HOW SHOULD I STAND?

06:47.209 --> 06:48.751
DO WHATEVER FEELS COMFORTABLE.

06:47.209 --> 06:48.751
OKAY.

06:53.209 --> 06:55.709
EXCEPT  THAT. </font>

06:53.209 --> 06:55.709
PLEASE DON'T DO  THAT.</font>

06:58.584 --> 07:01.918
SHOOT. I HAVE TO WORK

06:58.584 --> 07:01.918
THE RING TOSS BOOTH WITH GUS

06:58.584 --> 07:01.918
FOR THE NEXT HOUR.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.834
WHILE I'M GONE,

07:01.959 --> 07:03.834
STAY WITH SKYLAR

07:03.876 --> 07:05.459
AND MAKE SURE

07:03.876 --> 07:05.459
SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.125
RELAX. I'M NOT GONNA LET

07:05.500 --> 07:09.125
SKYLAR OUT OF MY SIGHT.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.000
YEAH, THAT'S NOT SKYLAR.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.334
AAAH!

07:16.250 --> 07:17.667
OH, UH, HEY.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.250
BEFORE WE START SOCIALIZING,

07:19.292 --> 07:21.542
THERE ARE SOME NORMO CUSTOMS

07:19.292 --> 07:21.542
YOU SHOULD LEARN.

07:21.584 --> 07:23.792
YOU KNOW, SO YOU DON'T

07:21.584 --> 07:23.792
STICK OUT.

07:21.584 --> 07:23.792
OKAY. LIKE WHAT?

07:23.834 --> 07:29.709
AS A GESTURE OF FRIENDSHIP,

07:23.834 --> 07:29.709
IT'S TYPICAL FOR NORMOS

07:23.834 --> 07:29.709
TO...HOLD HANDS...

07:29.751 --> 07:32.000
GAZE INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES,

07:32.042 --> 07:35.792
AND TO FEED EACH OTHER

07:32.042 --> 07:35.792
APPLE SLICES.

07:40.292 --> 07:44.959
( laughs ) CHECK ME  OUT. </font>

07:40.292 --> 07:44.959
I'M FITTING IN ALREADY!

07:47.459 --> 07:49.626
SO KAZ, YOU MADE IT.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.500
INTRODUCE ME.

07:54.667 --> 07:58.584
UH, UH, S-STEPHANIE,

08:03.959 --> 08:06.876
O-KAY.

08:06.918 --> 08:10.417
YEAH, SHE'S VERY INTENSE.

08:06.918 --> 08:10.417
I LIKE 'EM THAT WAY.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.209
WHAT HAPPENED TO

08:12.459 --> 08:14.209
THE RING TOSS BOOTH, GUS?

08:14.250 --> 08:17.334
THERE IS NO GUS.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.334
THERE IS ONLY...

08:17.375 --> 08:20.000
GUS ANGEL!

08:21.459 --> 08:23.542
AND FORGET RING TOSS.

08:23.584 --> 08:25.542
THE BEST WAY TO

08:23.584 --> 08:25.542
IMPRESS THE LADIES

08:25.584 --> 08:27.167
IS WITH MAGIC!

08:29.083 --> 08:33.042
WHOA! I MUST ADMIT THAT WAS

08:29.083 --> 08:33.042
A PRETTY COOL TRICK!

08:33.082 --> 08:36.375
THAT WASN'T A TRICK.

08:33.082 --> 08:36.375
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE

08:33.082 --> 08:36.375
THAT CAME FROM.

08:38.292 --> 08:41.500
ANYWAYS, I ORDERED

08:38.292 --> 08:41.500
A MAGIC CABINET FROM SERBIA,

08:41.542 --> 08:43.958
AND I'M GOING TO NEED YOU

08:41.542 --> 08:43.958
TO BE MY ASSISTANT.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.042
LET'S JUST STICK WITH

08:44.000 --> 08:46.042
THE RING TOSS BOOTH.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.667
FINE. CAN YOU HAND ME THE RINGS?

08:46.083 --> 08:49.667
THEY'RE RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.542
I CAN'T BELIEVE

08:56.792 --> 08:59.542
YOU LIED TO ME!

08:59.584 --> 09:03.584
IT WASN'T A LIE--

08:59.584 --> 09:03.584
IT WAS AN  ILLUSION!</font>

09:08.459 --> 09:10.918
WHERE ARE THESE  COMING </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> FROM?!</font>

09:15.792 --> 09:18.792
AND THIS IS YOU,

09:15.792 --> 09:18.792
BATTLING YOUR NEMESIS,

09:18.834 --> 09:20.042
THE BLACK FALCON.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.626
UNCLE HORACE.

09:21.667 --> 09:24.083
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH,

09:21.667 --> 09:24.083
AND IT TURNS OUT

09:24.125 --> 09:27.042
THAT AMNESIA CAN SOMETIMES

09:24.125 --> 09:27.042
BE CURED BY HYPNOSIS.

09:27.083 --> 09:29.918
ALAN, I SAID NO!

09:27.083 --> 09:29.918
FINE.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.584
THEN I'LL JUST TELL MY MOM

09:29.959 --> 09:32.584
TO POST THAT PICTURE OF YOU

09:32.626 --> 09:36.042
IN YOUR LITTLE POINTY HAT,

09:32.626 --> 09:36.042
WITH CAKE ALL OVER YOUR FACE,

09:36.083 --> 09:39.375
AT YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY--

09:36.083 --> 09:39.375
LAST YEAR.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.792
TITANIO, MY NEPHEW ALAN

09:40.751 --> 09:43.792
WILL BE HELPING YOU TODAY.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.626
TITANIO,

09:46.417 --> 09:48.626
THIS IS MESMERA.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.375
SHE HAS HYPNOTIC POWERS.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.834
I NEED YOU TO LOOK

09:50.417 --> 09:52.834
DIRECTLY INTO MESMERA'S...

09:52.876 --> 09:55.959
CREEPY HAND EYE THINGIE.

NOW, FEEL YOUR BODY RELAX

10:00.792 --> 10:03.000
AND WHEN I SAY THE WORD "STOP,"

10:03.042 --> 10:05.083
YOU WILL BE...TITANIO,

10:05.125 --> 10:07.042
A FEARLESS SUPERHERO

10:07.083 --> 10:09.959
WHO BATTLES THE BANE

10:07.083 --> 10:09.959
OF HIS EXISTENCE.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.918
AND...STOP!

10:12.792 --> 10:14.042
I FEEL NOTHING.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.667
Horace: I AM

10:15.709 --> 10:17.792
TITANIO, AND YOU

10:17.834 --> 10:20.667

10:17.834 --> 10:20.667
OF MY EXISTENCE!

10:20.709 --> 10:23.042
AAAAH!!!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.959
I DON'T REALLY THINK

10:23.083 --> 10:24.959
I'M TITANIO.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.959
BUT HE IS THE BANE

10:25.000 --> 10:26.959
OF MY EXISTENCE.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.375
AAAH!!!

10:31.918 --> 10:33.918
SO, YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S CUTE.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.375
ODD, BUT CUTE.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.042
YEAH. SHE'S GREAT.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.042
HEH HEH.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.751
THAT'S NOT HER.

10:44.751 --> 10:47.042
STOP FOLLOWING ME AROUND,

10:44.751 --> 10:47.042
JANET!

10:49.959 --> 10:53.083
ANYWAY, ARE YOU AND CONNIE

10:49.959 --> 10:53.083
SERIOUS?

10:53.125 --> 10:55.792
OH, YEAH,

10:53.125 --> 10:55.792
VERY, VERY SERIOUS.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.000
THAT'S TOO BAD.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.042
OH. NO. WHAT I MEANT WAS,

10:59.083 --> 11:02.125
WE'RE SERIOUS IN A WAY

10:59.083 --> 11:02.125
THAT IT MAKES ME COOL

10:59.083 --> 11:02.125
FOR HAVING A GIRLFRIEND,

11:02.167 --> 11:04.959
BUT NOT IN A WAY

11:02.167 --> 11:04.959
THAT IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE

11:05.000 --> 11:06.959
FOR ME TO GO OUT

11:05.000 --> 11:06.959
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.459
HMM.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.417
I, UH, I MADE THIS.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.584
OH.

IT'S LAVA CAKE.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.751

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
TO A PERSON'S INSIDES?

11:30.042 --> 11:32.042
I DO. I'VE SEEN IT

11:30.042 --> 11:32.042
HAPPEN BEFORE.

11:32.083 --> 11:33.792
AT THE LAVA PITS OF KELNAR.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.042

11:50.792 --> 11:53.125
I DIDN'T KNOW.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.125
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

11:54.584 --> 11:56.000
STEPHANIE, WAIT!

11:57.959 --> 12:00.626
GUS, I NEED TO GET OUT.

11:57.959 --> 12:00.626

ACCORDING TO

THIS BUTTON SHOULD OPEN

12:03.083 --> 12:05.792

AAAAH!

12:08.083 --> 12:10.042

12:15.959 --> 12:19.459
OH. THEN IT'S A GOOD THING

12:15.959 --> 12:19.459
WE DON'T HAVE A BABY IN THERE.

12:25.042 --> 12:26.083
( both laughing )

12:28.083 --> 12:29.959
I HAVE TO HELP MY FRIEND CONNIE!

12:30.000 --> 12:32.209
ISN'T THERE AN EMERGENCY

12:30.000 --> 12:32.209
EXIT IN HERE?

12:32.250 --> 12:35.125
OR, ON A SEPARATE NOTE,

12:32.250 --> 12:35.125
A BATHROOM?

12:37.042 --> 12:39.834
I'M SURE  THIS </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> BUTTON</font>

12:37.042 --> 12:39.834

THE OTHER BUTTON,

12:54.250 --> 12:56.751
I HATE MAGIC.

12:57.918 --> 12:59.584
I'M SORRY ABOUT CONNIE.

12:59.626 --> 13:02.667
SHE'S REALLY OVERPROTECTIVE

12:59.626 --> 13:02.667
AND POSSESSIVE OF ME.

13:02.709 --> 13:05.292
(sighs) IT'S ALL

13:02.709 --> 13:05.292
PART OF THE CURSE.

13:05.334 --> 13:08.918
WHAT CURSE?

14:05.292 --> 14:08.876
EVERYONE SO UPSET?

14:08.918 --> 14:09.959
LOOK AT THE SIGN.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.751
"DOUSE PRINCIPAL KRAUSS."

14:12.792 --> 14:15.918
THEY'RE JUST RAISING MONEY

14:12.792 --> 14:15.918

WHY ARE YOU DRESSED

15:13.959 --> 15:15.375
LIKE THAT?

15:15.417 --> 15:17.042
I READ THAT YOU CAN

15:15.417 --> 15:17.042
CURE AMNESIA BY

15:17.083 --> 15:19.751
RECREATING THE TRAUMATIC

15:17.083 --> 15:19.751
EVENT WHICH CAUSED IT,

15:19.792 --> 15:23.042
SO WE JUST NEED TO REENACT

15:19.792 --> 15:23.042
TITANIO'S BATTLE WITH...

15:23.083 --> 15:25.751
THE BLACK FALCON!

15:25.792 --> 15:30.876
THAT IS NOT A TERRIBLE,

15:25.792 --> 15:30.876
HALF-WITTED, ALAN-MINDED IDEA.

15:30.918 --> 15:32.834
OKAY, GIVE IT A SHOT.

A STORM RAGED LIKE NONE OTHER

15:39.500 --> 15:44.918
IN 10,000 FORTNIGHTS.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.876
THUNDER ROARED...

15:48.918 --> 15:50.334
( clanking )

15:52.292 --> 15:55.042
THE WIND WHIPPED

15:52.292 --> 15:55.042
FURIOUSLY...

15:55.083 --> 15:56.125
( blowing )

16:00.083 --> 16:03.542
AND I, THE BLACK FALCON,

16:03.584 --> 16:07.000
SWOOPED DOWN TO BEAT

16:03.584 --> 16:07.000
THE MEMORY OUT OF YOU!

FORMER TEST PILOT

16:09.417 --> 16:12.500
TURNED AEROSPACE ENGINEER.

16:12.542 --> 16:17.250
I CREATED THIS EXO-SKELETON SUIT

16:12.542 --> 16:17.250
AND BECAME TITANIO.

16:17.292 --> 16:20.042

WELL DONE, MY BOY!

16:49.542 --> 16:52.167

16:49.542 --> 16:52.167
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:52.209 --> 16:55.000

AND I JUST EMBARRASSED MYSELF

16:55.042 --> 16:58.167

16:58.209 --> 17:00.459
I'M SO SORRY. I TRIED,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.375
BUT I-I WAS STUCK

CALM DOWN. EVERYTHING'S

17:11.500 --> 17:14.041
GONNA BE OKAY.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.917
I SAID I'D HAVE YOUR BACK,

17:14.083 --> 17:17.917
AND I DIDN'T.

17:17.959 --> 17:19.541
I'M A TERRIBLE FRIEND.

17:19.584 --> 17:21.459
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.917

19:57.459 --> 20:00.709
A GOOD PERSON.

20:00.751 --> 20:04.125

YOU WANT NOTHING TO DO

20:30.667 --> 20:34.125
WITH NORMOS?

20:34.167 --> 20:37.042
ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING ABOUT

20:34.167 --> 20:37.042
COMING TO SCHOOL HERE.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.334
REALLY?

20:37.083 --> 20:39.334
YEAH.

I LIVE FOR DANGER

20:39.375 --> 20:41.709
AND DRAMA,

20:41.751 --> 20:44.500
AND WHAT'S MORE DANGEROUS

20:41.751 --> 20:44.500
AND DRAMATIC THAN HIGH SCHOOL?

20:44.542 --> 20:49.334
BESIDES, WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GO

20:44.542 --> 20:49.334
THAT HAS A CARNIVAL EVERY DAY?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.459
SHOULD WE TELL HER

20:52.167 --> 20:54.459
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS

20:52.167 --> 20:54.459
EVERY DAY?

20:54.500 --> 20:57.042
EH, SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT

20:54.500 --> 20:57.042
IT'S LIKE TO BE A NORMO,

20:57.083 --> 20:58.667
LESSON NUMBER ONE:

20:57.083 --> 20:58.667
DISAPPOINTMENT.

21:03.751 --> 21:06.042
KIND SIR...

21:06.083 --> 21:08.167
YOU SEEM TO HAVE SOME LINT

21:06.083 --> 21:08.167
ON YOUR JACKET.

21:08.209 --> 21:09.751
LET ME GET IT FOR YOU.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.083
WHAT'S WITH  HIM?</font>

21:13.125 --> 21:15.209

TODAY.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.709
AND I MISSED IT?

21:16.751 --> 21:19.709
THE ONE DAY I'M NOT HERE...

21:19.751 --> 21:23.042
ANYWAY, HE'S SUFFERING

21:19.751 --> 21:23.042
FROM AMNESIA--

21:23.083 --> 21:25.292
HE'S FORGOTTEN

21:23.083 --> 21:25.292
HOW UNPLEASANT HE IS.

21:25.334 --> 21:26.667
WHY ARE YOU

21:25.334 --> 21:26.667
GONNA CURE HIM?

21:26.709 --> 21:30.626
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE HUNGRY,

21:26.709 --> 21:30.626
SO I MADE YOU A DENVER OMELET.

21:30.667 --> 21:34.459
CURE HIM? OH, LET'S NOT

21:30.667 --> 21:34.459
RUSH INTO ANYTHING.
