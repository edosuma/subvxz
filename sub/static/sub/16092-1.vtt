00:58.433 --> 01:00.060
J' When I need it so bad J'

01:00.227 --> 01:04.072
J' Why do you not come to defend? J'

01:04.230 --> 01:06.529
J' Is that any way to tell me
that you're gonna be J'

01:06.692 --> 01:08.239
J' A terrible friend? J'

01:08.402 --> 01:11.497
J' You remind me of a distant
constellation I

01:11.655 --> 01:13.999
J' The way you cover it up,
but don't even touch J'

01:14.157 --> 01:16.831
J' And now you want to know,
is that important? <i>I</i>

01:16.994 --> 01:19.122
J' Baby, now, well,
it just depends J'

01:19.288 --> 01:21.131
J' It just depends J'

01:42.853 --> 01:44.821
J' And when you come back
uptown J'

01:44.980 --> 01:48.701
J' Remember not to look
for me there J'

01:48.859 --> 01:50.907
J' I gave you one more chance
to make it better J'

01:51.069 --> 01:52.662
J' But you don't seem to care J'

01:52.821 --> 01:55.950
J' You pretend to be accosted
by tradition J'

01:56.116 --> 01:58.790
J' And now you cover it up,
but tell me you don't J'

01:58.952 --> 02:01.580
J' Now you want to know,
is nothing sacred? J'

02:01.747 --> 02:03.749
J' Well, I don't want to
have to compare J'

02:03.915 --> 02:05.917
J' They don't compare... J'

02:07.252 --> 02:09.253
( phones ringing )

02:13.592 --> 02:16.061
( chattering )

02:16.219 --> 02:20.065
16-inch radials, the new Nanoprene.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.601
Don't blow smoke
up my rump, okay?

02:22.768 --> 02:24.270
If I don't hear
"1,000 more units"...

02:24.436 --> 02:28.361
Let me just check on
the load index on that for you.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.197
Um, you know, looks like it's--

02:31.360 --> 02:33.829
What's that? No, everything--
we recycle every tire.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864
Man: Okay, okay,
now we are talking.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.955
All right, let mejust pull up
the paperwork here.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.414
We'll get you squared away.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.296
Your store needs products, right?
So what's the problem?

02:43.455 --> 02:46.629
It's about safety. It's about safety
for your family, for your customers.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.796
I mean, that's the bottom line.
These are the safest tires on the road.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.929
You know that.
I'm not trying to bullshit you.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.887
You did the right thing.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.392
Bye.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.178
Butch, mark one up
for me, please--

02:58.345 --> 03:00.723
three this morning.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.358
One more for Mike, baby.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.071
How can we be out of donuts?

03:08.230 --> 03:09.573
I mean, it's ridiculous.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.574
And the coffee machine's busted.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.077
Where are they?
( knocking )

03:14.236 --> 03:17.661
Hey, ladies.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.327
Ladies, ladies, ladies, we have
a very serious problem here.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.710
We're out of donuts.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.372
Jane, maybe you could get
one of your girls on it ASAP.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.668
- And the coffee machine's busted.
- And the coffee machine's busted.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.711
These guys are such a-holes.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.879
No, excuse me.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.423
I already checked it.
It's fried.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.307
You might want to just
call the company.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.685
Oh, look.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.439
Oh.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.226
Where are those donuts? Oh.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.360
Thanks, Jane.
You're the best.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.115
High five?
No.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.947
Low five? No.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.406
Thank you.
Thank you, Jane.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.288
Ken:
You gotta be kidding me.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.199
O'Donnell:
So she's your dream girl, right?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.914
Kline: No, she reminds me
of my dad.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.078
Ken.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.292
<i>HEY</i>

04:06.455 --> 04:07.957
Oh, well, well,

04:08.123 --> 04:10.467
I'm surprised you two even show up
to these sales meetings.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.797
How are you doing, Kenny?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.803
It's Ken, dickhead.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.637
And I know you've been
fudging the numbers.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.142
He knows we've been fudging
the numbers.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.928
Fuck you, Castro.
Our numbers are legit.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.643
But we know you shit your pants
at last year's Christmas party.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.648
Dude, that's disgusting.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.276
I didn't really--
it wasn't like a full-on--

04:28.435 --> 04:30.483
it was a dribble.
( laughs )

04:30.645 --> 04:33.569
It was-- everybody does it.
It was a mistake.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.702
L-- I had bad sushi
and I sharted.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.488
The fart part was intentional,
but I didn't--

04:39.654 --> 04:40.701
( upbeat music playing )

04:40.864 --> 04:43.492
I'm Bob Reilly, owner and CEO
of Reilly Auto Parts.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.002
At Reilly, we carry only
the highest-quality names

04:46.161 --> 04:48.505
like Goodyear, Firestone
and Michelin.

04:48.663 --> 04:52.213
Freeze. Now what's wrong
with this commercial?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
Lights.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.307
Come on.
He doesn't mention Treadline.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.094
Mr. Farrell,

05:02.260 --> 05:05.264
someone was messing
with my chair,

05:05.430 --> 05:08.434
so it's stuck
in the down position...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.398
( people chuckling )

05:10.560 --> 05:12.779
...so if I seem petite,

05:12.938 --> 05:16.112
then that is the reason.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.947
Will someone get him
a booster seat?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.032
( laughter)

05:20.195 --> 05:23.199
Now R&D and manufacturing
have done their job.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.868
Now it's up to us in sales
to get these tires on the shelves.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.536
Can you take notes for me?
I forgot my pen.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.045
We've closed deals
with AutoZone, Pep Boys

05:29.204 --> 05:30.456
- and Just Tires.
- Thanks.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.045
Now we're going after
bigger fish--

05:33.208 --> 05:35.631
Reilly Auto Parts.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.102
One last piece
of business here--

05:44.261 --> 05:47.891
it has come to my attention
that some sick individual

05:48.056 --> 05:49.933
in our sales department

05:50.100 --> 05:54.321
has been spreading pornographic
emails of a homosexual nature.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.447
( Coughing )
Kenny Castro.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.732
Castro.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.276
Are you all right?
He's all right.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.910
No, I wasn't--
( chuckles )

06:01.069 --> 06:03.913
No, I didn't. It wasn't me.
It wasn't-- I didn't do that.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.417
L-- they're trying to say
it was me, but it wasn't.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.453
I didn't-- I wouldn't.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.792
It wouldn't be gay.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.707
I wasn't-- I mean, I'd do--

06:13.874 --> 06:16.252
I mean, I wouldn't even do
regular porno,

06:16.418 --> 06:18.591
but if I did, it would be regular,
is my point.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.390
Come on, Kenny,
get your hands out of your pants

06:22.549 --> 06:25.393
- and put an end to it.
-( laughter)

06:25.552 --> 06:28.931
Now I expect everyone in this room
to step up their effort.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.021
Come on, let's get out there
and kick some ass

06:32.183 --> 06:35.813
and make this the best
sales quarter ever.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.653
( Men cheering )

06:38.815 --> 06:41.068
You know it.
You know it.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.659
Let's work the phones.
Let's do it.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.789
All right, Steve,
so let me tell you

06:46.948 --> 06:48.666
why you need these tires
in your stores, okay?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.793
It's about safety.
Seriously, I would let--

06:50.952 --> 06:53.205
you know, let babies roll down hills
in these things.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.624
Mmmmm.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.918
Tire sizes?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.837
Bro, you're asking a lot
of complicated questions.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.631
Yeah, I work here.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.391
Yeah, we have maintenance.
Believe me, this tire will leave

07:05.550 --> 07:07.973
a bigger footprint than--

07:08.136 --> 07:10.514
than Bigfoot, right?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.557
You know 50 Cent?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.227
He absolutely loves our tires.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.646
I mean, you know that.
I'm not trying to bullshit you here.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.780
I mean, listen, want to hear
something crazy?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.409
I have actually rolled babies
down hills in these things.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.114
I'm not lying.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.871
You know, just Google
"50 Cent and tires."

07:27.030 --> 07:29.408
You just did?

07:29.574 --> 07:32.168
It didn't?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.830
Well, I don't know.
Maybe your Google's broken.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.296
Believe me,
as a senior salesman around here,

07:38.458 --> 07:40.176
let's just say I know
a thing or two--

07:40.335 --> 07:42.133
ow! Hang on.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.215
- Hang on one second, please.
- Oh, hey, Joe.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.635
Oh. I'm sorry.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.178
There's-- yeah.
No, no, there's--

07:49.344 --> 07:52.223
we have a faulty air-conditioning unit
in the building.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.437
( Both chattering, laughing )

07:54.599 --> 07:56.021
<i>-</i> Oh, hi.
- Oh, hey.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.028
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you new here?

07:59.187 --> 08:01.155
Yeah, I am-- first day.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.112
Yeah, I thought so.
See, 'cause we don't--

08:03.274 --> 08:05.527
we don't actually get that many
secretaries sitting here.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.789
Mike: This is pretty much
understood as our table.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.745
We eat here every day.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.534
All we do is talk
about sports and fishing

08:12.701 --> 08:14.248
and would probably
bore the hell out of you.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.038
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.376
You got that? You good?

08:17.539 --> 08:18.791
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.426
Welcome to Treadline.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.428
Welcome to Treadline? What, are you
the official Treadline greeter?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.305
( Fans cheering )

08:32.721 --> 08:34.722
Man over P.A.:
And that's the ball game.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.563
Treadline wins 6-5.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.602
Good comeback, baby.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.236
- Nice. Nice.
- Nice toss.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.568
Lucky catch, McAdams.
I'm surprised you didn't drop it.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.325
Oh, like that pop fly
you dropped in the third?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.780
A fifth grader could
run that down.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.116
Hey, I told you
the lights got in my eyes.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.407
They gotta turn the volume down
on those things.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.871
Hey, can we trade him to another team
for, like, a keg of beer?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.332
<i>-</i> Or just give him away?
-( laughter)

08:56.494 --> 08:58.667
Ha ha ha ha.
You know what, Murphy?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.503
I'm so sick of you.
I really am.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.418
You're about due for a beatdown
UFC-style.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.586
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.347
- All right, bring it.
- Yeah, let's go.

09:07.505 --> 09:08.927
Come on, let's bring it.
Come on.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.264
Come on, you can do it.
Come on. Come on.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.896
Another great game, guys.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.433
Hey, come on, Kenny,
you're out of uniform.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.101
Tuck that shirt in.
Come on now.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.110
It's just "Ken," sir.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.863
Hey, you two, let's get out there
and celebrate. I'm buying.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.945
- Nice.
- Wow, what a victory.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.610
That double play was
just fabulous.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.326
- Tailor-made. Tailor-made.
- Yeah. Hey, where are we gonna go?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.162
- Both: Flight Club.
- Oh, boy, the Flight Club.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.497
( Rock music playing )

09:41.956 --> 09:42.957
Hi.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.468
Oh, hey, Destiny. Looking good.
Love the new boobs.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.129
Thanks, Rodney.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.638
J' When I was nine years old J'

09:48.797 --> 09:51.266
J' I knew what I was gonna do J'

09:51.424 --> 09:53.893
J' A little bass, drums, guitar,
I put on a show for you... <i>I</i>

09:54.052 --> 09:56.646
We sell tires.
We're Treadline.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.728
Oh-ho-ho. Uh-oh.

09:58.890 --> 10:02.611
J' When all the old folks said, "This
shit gen' bring out the devil in you" J'

10:02.769 --> 10:05.067
J' Rock 'n' roll... J'

10:05.230 --> 10:06.903

10:13.988 --> 10:16.832

Treadline in the house!

10:16.991 --> 10:18.538
Good, right--
get out of the office?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.499
- J' Rock 'n' roll... J'
- ( growling )

10:20.662 --> 10:22.790
J' It's all I want to do,
it's all I want to do J'

10:22.956 --> 10:25.800
J' Rock 'n' roll... J'

10:27.418 --> 10:31.889
( panting )

10:35.385 --> 10:37.058
Mm, baby.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.188
Oh, Jesus.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.600
Good morning, Lucy.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.269
Good morning, Ed.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.437
Rodney.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.700
( Footsteps )

10:55.363 --> 10:56.865
( scoffs )

10:58.032 --> 10:59.579
God knows what
our neighbors think.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.962
Oh, Ed and Lucy didn't seem
to mind, trust me.

11:05.206 --> 11:09.632
You know, it's like you still think
you're in your 20s, you know?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.922
But, honey, you're not.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.341
So get over it and grow up.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.054
Yeah, okay.
So, look,

11:16.217 --> 11:18.561
obviously things got a little
out of control last night, okay?

11:18.720 --> 11:22.270
And I'm-- all I can say is
I'm ashamed.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.025
That's it?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.153
I'm really--
I'm really ashamed.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.155
Wow. Do me a favor--

11:29.314 --> 11:31.533
keep it together for
the engagement party this weekend.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.069
That's it.
That's all I ask.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.737
Okay?

11:37.071 --> 11:40.621
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't be like that.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.003
Don't walk away like this, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.381
I'm sorry, okay?
It won't happen again, I promise.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.883
And this weekend
I'll be on my best behavior.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.261
I know, but I always let you off
so easy and you can't--

11:51.419 --> 11:55.674
Yes. Yes, I can.
What if I run down the streets naked

11:55.840 --> 11:57.968
professing my love for you?

11:58.134 --> 12:01.388
Don't tempt me,
'cause I might make you do it.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.806
- Fine, do it.
<i>-</i> I will.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.770
- Okay, good. Deal.
- You don't think I will?

12:04.933 --> 12:06.310
- I hope you do.
<i>-</i> I will.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.604
I'm ready.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.114
My father thinks I'm crazy
for marrying you.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.650
Uh, isn't he, like,
on his fourth wife?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.285
It's kind of like getting
marriage advice from Larry King.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.867
Come on.
I'm sorry.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.283
You look pretty.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.450
Thank you.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.665
What-- what are you wearing
under there?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.129
( Groans )

12:34.295 --> 12:36.639
Oh, my God.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.515
( Liquid pouring )

12:45.682 --> 12:48.481
Good morning, sweetheart.
How is my baby?

12:48.643 --> 12:51.772
Hung over as shit, Mom,
but thanks for asking.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.066
(sighs )

12:55.233 --> 12:57.156
Find your own place yet?

12:57.318 --> 13:00.492
I'm working on it.
I'm a little short on cash right now.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.329
That's because you spend it all
on booze and strippers.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.585
That is a pack of lies
and you know it.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.495
What kind of a man
do you think I am?

13:07.662 --> 13:10.916
"Just booze and strippers"-
that's outrageous. I'm offended.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.504
'Morning.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.590
Mike: Hey, look who's up.
Good morning, Destiny.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.629
Come on.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.094
What can I get
for you, dear?

13:19.257 --> 13:21.259
I'll take a cup of coffee, thanks.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.020
I rest my case.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.099
<i>-</i> Thank you. Oh.
- There you go.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.314
She's much better
than the one last week.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.696
- Yeah, Mom, this one's a keeper.
- Yeah, I know.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.701
J' It's not the weight
that you carry on your back J'

13:37.859 --> 13:39.861
J' It's not your last laugh J'

13:40.028 --> 13:41.780
J' It's not your game J'

13:41.946 --> 13:45.871
J' It's not the way that you
wear your silent now... J'

13:46.034 --> 13:47.877
Rodney: Destiny went back
to your house?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.755
Mike: She did indeed.
In fact, I think she's still there.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.166
It's all right, though.
My mom's gonna take her shopping.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.755
Rodney:
Oh, that sounds terrific.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.215
You've been going there
for, what, five years?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.051
- You know what?
- You still don't know her real name?

13:59.213 --> 14:01.557
Here's what I do know:
She liked cuddling.

14:01.716 --> 14:05.721
You gotta be the only guy I know
who cuddles with a stripper.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.106
What's up with everyone here?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.858
I don't know.
Maybe somebody got fired.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.941
Hey, Kline, what the hell
is going on here?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.730
You didn't hear about Farrell?

14:15.897 --> 14:17.774
Hear about it?
Dude, we were there.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.738
Yeah, the old man was a legend
last night.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.825
He broke Flight Club's
all-time lap dance record.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.581
He's dead--

14:25.740 --> 14:27.993
heart attack.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.754
Does everybody else know?

14:34.916 --> 14:36.918
( Sobbing )

14:40.713 --> 14:42.886
(thunder rumbling )

14:45.927 --> 14:49.227
Priest: The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall lack nothing.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.313
He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.445
Even though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

14:55.603 --> 14:56.946
I will fear no evil.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.109
You don't think we had anything
to do with his death, do you?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.117
What? No.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.949
No way.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.661
It's not like we forced him to do
all those tequila shots.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.292
No. He's the one who wanted
to dance with the strippers.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.667
Yeah.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.831
J' Oh, yeah J'

15:13.996 --> 15:17.000
J' The bitch wants more... J'

15:17.166 --> 15:18.634
( crowd cheering )

15:20.628 --> 15:24.178
It's the last memory I'm gonna have
of that crazy old bastard.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.184
Shut the fuck up.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.345
Priest: ...follow me all the days
of my life.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.855
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord...

15:31.013 --> 15:32.890
Now that Farrell's dead,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.276
who do you think
corporate's gonna promote?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.938
I don't know.
Probably some real douche.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.607
Aw, looking good, Willy.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.491
<i>-</i> Give that a little polish, eh?
- Yes, sir.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.493
Yeah, when you close.
Okay, good.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.030
( Sighs )
Well, gentlemen,

15:47.196 --> 15:48.664
it's a new day,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.700
a new regime.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.620
I guess seniority
has its perks, huh?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.130
And now guess what time it is.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.667
It's payback time.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.803
See, you two have made
working here a I--

16:01.961 --> 16:04.055
a living hell for me,
all right?

16:04.213 --> 16:07.262
You pretty much did that yourself
by being an asshole.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.598
If this is about me sending
that vibrator to your mom,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.808
I was totally drunk
at the time--

16:11.971 --> 16:13.689
-( Rodney chuckles )
- --gone.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.850
Yeah, he was.
I can vouch for that.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.860
You--

16:18.019 --> 16:20.943
you sent my mother
a vibrator?

16:21.105 --> 16:22.778
Just a little one.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.534
You leave my mother's vagina
out of this!

16:25.693 --> 16:28.287
Are we done here?
I've got tires to sell.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.574
No, we're not done, McAdams.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.913
We have only just begun.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.964
See, I haven't forgotten the humiliation
that you two have put me through.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.250
What humiliation?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.545
Are you serious? How about
that male stripper on my birthday?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.384
J' Give me some more J'

16:45.546 --> 16:47.890
J' Get on the floor,
come on... J'

16:48.049 --> 16:49.096
( laughing )

16:49.258 --> 16:51.135
All right, what about
when you put Ecstasy

16:51.302 --> 16:53.851
in me and Kline's drinks
at the company carnival?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.983
<i>-</i> How are you doing, Mr. Castro?
- Argh! Jesus!

17:02.146 --> 17:04.398
It's not funny.
That's a felony.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.739
That's a felony, all right?
That's a felony.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.530
And I don't have
the lab results yet,

17:10.695 --> 17:12.573
but I'm pretty sure
it was one of you two

17:12.740 --> 17:14.867
who took a dump on the hood
of my car last week.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.162
- Right on his window.
-( laughing )

17:17.328 --> 17:19.079
Shh.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.250
<i>-</i> Oh.
- Dude.

17:22.415 --> 17:24.919
Shut the fuck up.
It's okay. It's okay.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.262
Jesus Christ.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.345
Whoa. Whoa.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.136
Yeah, yeah, ha ha ha.
Laugh it up. Laugh it up,

17:33.302 --> 17:35.100
because the fun's over,
all right?

17:35.263 --> 17:38.437
From now on, this place is gonna be
run by my rules.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.103
I could fire your punk asses
right now, no questions asked.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.442
Yeah, well, then why don't you?

17:43.604 --> 17:46.824
'Cause if this is what it's gonna be
like working for you, we're better off.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.360
You think I'm that stupid?

17:48.526 --> 17:51.120
- ( Both laugh )
- I fire you and you walk out of here

17:51.279 --> 17:52.997
with great, big
severance packages.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.578
- That sounds good to me.
- I bet it does.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.745
Yeah, well, you can kiss that
wet dream goodbye,

17:58.911 --> 18:00.163
'cause you're not being fired.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.299
Instead...

18:03.457 --> 18:05.710
you're being demoted.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.594
Demoted?
Are you kidding?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.630
To what? Interns?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.390
What, are you gonna
make us janitors?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.142
( laughs )

18:13.301 --> 18:16.680
How about secretaries?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.851
Yeah.

18:22.018 --> 18:25.067
( laughs )
Who's laughing now?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.106
Not you two.
Right here,

18:27.273 --> 18:29.241
this is an honest,
genuine laugh.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.448
( laughing loudly )

18:41.287 --> 18:42.880
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.041
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm packing up my shit.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.834
Yeah, don't you think
we should talk about this?

18:47.001 --> 18:49.754
There's nothing to talk about.
Demoted to secretaries? Fuck that.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.672
We're out of here.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.137
I know exactly what you're thinking,
but don't worry.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.677
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.517
We're gonna grab some breakfast,
charge up the old batteries,

18:58.679 --> 19:00.272
hit the pavement,
and find some new jobs.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.184
Everything will be hunky-dory.
Who wouldn't hire us?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.441
I'm gonna be honest with you,
gentlemen--

19:06.604 --> 19:08.356
your resumes aren't great.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.524
It does look like you have some
decent sales experience here.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.364
Is there someone I could call
over at Treadline,

19:12.526 --> 19:14.449
maybe a reference
of some sort?

19:14.612 --> 19:16.535
( Clears throat )
A reference?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.792
Yeah, that's-- that's gonna be
a bit of a problem.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.123
Our reference sort of died.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.756
( Chuckles )
Yeah, it's a long story.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.792
There was drinking
and strippers

19:27.958 --> 19:29.960
and we might have
inadvertently killed him.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.596
Rodney: No criminal charges
have been filed of any kind.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.052
- We're not sure.
- No, no.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.264
- I'm pretty sure we're in the clear.
- Well, we're not totally sure,

19:37.426 --> 19:40.179
so fingers crossed.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.275
<i>-</i> Get the fuck out of here.
- Thank you.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.408
Mike:
This sucks.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.241
Rodney: What if this is just temporary?
Maybe I can fix this.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.077
A couple of days,
a week or two at the most--

19:58.239 --> 19:59.582
bam!
We get our old jobs back.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.334
What if you can't fix it?
What if we're stuck being secretaries?

20:02.493 --> 20:05.747
Rodney: Relax.
How bad can this be?

20:05.913 --> 20:09.417
We start at 8:00 a.m. sharp,
finish at 6:00,

20:09.583 --> 20:12.211
15-minute breaks
and half-hour lunches.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.597
I hope that's not going
to be a problem.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.428
Yeah, actually, we're more

20:16.590 --> 20:18.763
on the 9:00 to 5:00 schedule.
Farrell was cool with that.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.928
Sometimes 10:00 to 4:00,
depending on if we're hung over.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.473
He's dead.
You're on my schedule now--

20:23.639 --> 20:25.482
8:00 a.m., no excuses.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.393
And try to look
a little more professional.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.437
I prefer comfort
to professional.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.822
Maybe you prefer
my foot up your ass.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.734
Let's motor on.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.154
We're expected to keep this break room
neat and tidy at all times.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.039
Yes, we're the little elves that wash
the dishes in that sink.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.246
We're expected to keep
the donuts stocked

20:43.409 --> 20:45.628
and the coffee fresh
every morning,

20:45.786 --> 20:49.290
which is why we don't drink and eat
all the coffee and the donuts.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.926
The secretaries have
their own break room.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.630
Rodney:
Are you kidding?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.720
Mike: I don't think she's kidding.
Isn't this a storage closet?

20:58.883 --> 21:00.510
Rodney:
There's no TV in here.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.269
How are we supposed to watch
"Sports Center"?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.305
- There's no donuts.
- No.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.225
Donut-free zone.
We're all on diets.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.485
Ugh. This is bad.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.395
No donuts.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.607
The phone system
is a nightmare.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.822
The filing system's even worse.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.488
Our computers are pieces of crap,
so, you know, deal with it.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.908
Oh, and on Fridays,

21:24.074 --> 21:26.327
all the girls like
to get together after work

21:26.494 --> 21:28.917
for a book club.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.002
At least that's what
we tell our husbands.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.008
But...
( laughs )

21:33.167 --> 21:37.547
we usually go to Bennigan's
for happy hour, though.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.057
( Chuckles )

21:42.009 --> 21:44.103
In case you're ever interested.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.185
Oh, thanks,
but we actually have

21:47.348 --> 21:49.225
- our own happy hour spot we go to.
- Oh.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.268
Yeah, one that has
half-naked women

21:51.435 --> 21:53.563
swinging around on poles,
which is awesome.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.482
Well, not just on poles.
They kind of get on all fours and--

21:57.942 --> 21:59.694
If you're into
that sort of thing,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.534
which we're not,

22:02.696 --> 22:05.245
so we only go for the buffet.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.409
Oh, I'm sure.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.213
Well, I think it's time for you
to meet your new bosses.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.546
Well, you know as well as I do,
anything that's gonna boost production

22:14.708 --> 22:17.052
is gonna make me
happy as a clam.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.054
You got it, Chuck.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.590
( Knocks )

22:20.756 --> 22:24.477
Yeah, hey, let me call you back
in a little bit, you old son of a bitch.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.103
All right.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.892
Mr. Frank, I'd like to introduce you
to Rodney McAdams,

22:30.057 --> 22:31.684
your new secretary.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.398
Uh, no, thanks, sweetheart.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.659
Tell Kenny that the manufacturing
department

22:39.817 --> 22:42.491
would like someone
who's just a little bit more

22:42.653 --> 22:44.826
perky on top,
if you know what I mean.

22:46.073 --> 22:50.123
Well, I do, Mr. Frank.
I know exactly what you mean.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.788
Yee-haw.

22:51.954 --> 22:55.754
But unfortunately,
Mr. Castro has asked

22:55.916 --> 22:57.759
that Rodney be assigned to you,

22:57.918 --> 23:00.637
so happy trails.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.473
Well, have a seat, Nancy.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.103
Actually, it's Rodney, sir.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.310
Yeah, whatever.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.770
A male secretary, huh?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.233
Shit, you might as well
just have your balls cut off.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.446
Oh, yeah.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.200
Can I help you?

23:29.366 --> 23:32.165
Hey, sister. Wrong office.
I've already been assigned to this guy.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.296
Excuse me?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.173
This guy's covered, all set.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.959
You'd better go find yourself
another boss.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.298
Would you grab me a cup of coffee
while you're out there,

23:40.461 --> 23:42.304
while I'm waiting around
for this a-hole?

23:42.463 --> 23:44.306
Oh, good.
You're both here.

23:44.465 --> 23:47.435
Mike Murphy, meet Elizabeth Holland--
your new boss.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.940
By the way, this a-hole
likes her coffee black, no sugar.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.317
- ( Yelps )
- ( chuckles )

23:55.476 --> 23:57.854
Thanks.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.318
So who did you get?

24:00.481 --> 24:03.325
Some outside accountant corporate's
brought in to audit the books.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.865
That's what you got to do.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.156
Dude, what the fuck?

24:08.322 --> 24:11.326
<i>-</i> Hey, Castro.
- Rodney: Hey, hey, hey.

24:11.492 --> 24:14.666
<i>-</i> Hey, Castro. Are you guys kidding?
- Oh, whoopsy-doopsy.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.547
Sorry, guys,
I'm afraid there's no more room.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.333
<i>-</i> What's going on?
- No, no, no, Castro.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.673
We always sit here, okay?
Everybody knows this is our table.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.964
Oh, yeah? Is that right?
Well, guess what. Not any more,

24:25.130 --> 24:27.724
'cause maybe I'd like to sit here
once in a while.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.978
You know, why don't you
go sit with the secretaries--

24:31.136 --> 24:32.854
you know, where you belong?

24:33.013 --> 24:35.812
( Chuckles )

24:35.975 --> 24:37.352
Go on.
You'll fit right in.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.816
Oh, one other thing:

24:39.979 --> 24:42.778
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn in
your softball uniforms.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.942
- You're gonna kick us off the team?
- Yeah.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.237
What, is everybody on board
with this?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.747
How about you, Kline?

24:49.905 --> 24:51.828
What did he offer you
to stab us in the back--

24:51.991 --> 24:54.210
a pay raise,
your own private parking spot?

24:54.368 --> 24:55.870
A parking--
yeah, a parking spot

24:56.036 --> 24:57.913
What about you, O'Donnell?
What did you get?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.707
Oh, wait, let me guess-
a hand job?

25:05.754 --> 25:08.257
Look,

25:08.424 --> 25:10.643
Kline and O'Donnell
are smart men.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.929
They know who signs
the paychecks.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.144
Yeah? And they sure as shit
don't want to end up like you two.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.559
And I don't think
they're alone.

25:18.726 --> 25:22.026
See, certain people around here
have had to put up with you clowns

25:22.187 --> 25:23.564
'cause they had to,

25:23.731 --> 25:26.530
'cause you were Farrell's
golden boys.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.411
Well, guess what.
That old fucker's dead.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.039
That makes you

25:32.197 --> 25:33.915
just my bitches.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.543
You cannot turn this entire company
against us, Castro.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.579
Oh, yeah? Well, I can
sure as hell try, McAdams.

25:38.746 --> 25:40.589
Now why don't you two beat it

25:40.748 --> 25:43.046
before I have you restocking
the tampon machines?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.801
( laughing )
Whoa! Ta-dah!

25:44.960 --> 25:47.088
Hey, Kline.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.590
Yeah, bye-bye.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.260
- Toodle-00.
- Enjoy the Salisbury steak.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.929
Don't let it hit you on the ass
when the door--

25:55.095 --> 25:57.598
I mean, if you're going out.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.767
Hey, ladies.
How's it going?

25:59.933 --> 26:02.356
Our table's a bit crowded today.
Do you mind if we join you?

26:02.519 --> 26:05.113
Oh, I'm saving these
for somebody.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.990
You boys don't want
to sit here anyway.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.743
All we do is talk
about makeup and diets.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.405
We'd probably bore
the hell out of you.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.291
Don't cry.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.133
They should cry.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.419
Now they get to see
what it feels like.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.087
They did the same thing
to everybody else,

26:28.253 --> 26:29.971
and now they get a taste
of their own medicine.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.175
Mike:
This blows.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.720
It's not great.

26:35.886 --> 26:39.356
J' You'd never met me,
not seen me before J'

26:39.515 --> 26:42.985
J' But you knew all about me
when I walked through the door J'

26:43.143 --> 26:47.193
J' You had me figured,
yeah, you knew J'

26:47.356 --> 26:49.358
J' I'm the kind of boy
to go crazy for you... J'

26:49.525 --> 26:51.493
Let's face it--
Castro's got us by the balls.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.746
That's true.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.156
Oh, shit.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.666
It's Jennifer's dad
and his teen bride.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.748
I know, I know.
I'm gonna get you one.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.878
- Encore.
- Yes, sir.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.005
Mr. Daniels,
looking dapper as usual.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.007
Rodney, at the bar as usual.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.168
Hi, cutie.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.054
- How are you doing?
- Good.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.634
Good.
You're looking good,

27:14.800 --> 27:16.177
really good.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.345
Stop eye-fucking
my wife, son.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.015
- ( Wife chuckles) Oh, J.R.
- Sure.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.478
What the hell
is the matter with you?

27:23.851 --> 27:25.524
Good to see you,
Mr. Daniels.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.655
Wow.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.740
What a prick.

27:35.445 --> 27:38.699
Are you absolutely certain
you want to marry into that?

27:38.866 --> 27:41.289
After all the shit
that's gone down,

27:41.451 --> 27:43.203
J.R.'s just the start
of my problems.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.122
What about you?
You're just as screwed as I am.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.963
- You still live with your parents.
- I do not live with my parents.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.173
I live in an apartment
which they happen to live above.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.134
- You live in their basement.
- It's not their basement, okay?

27:53.297 --> 27:55.391
It's my basement--
a subterranean loft.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.603
Rodney.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.737
Mr. Daniels.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.774
You know, Rodney,

28:11.940 --> 28:14.238
I didn't come in here
because I needed to take a whiz.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.575
<i>-</i> You didn't?
- No, I didn't.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.911
I thought it was time
I had a little chitchat

28:20.073 --> 28:22.576
with my future son-in-law.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.462
Oh, you mind giving me a little
second to finish up here?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.957
Look at me, Rodney.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.252
Sir, I'd really rather not.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.671
You've got your thing going on
over there. I've got my thing--

28:33.837 --> 28:35.464
I said look at me.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.723
<i>Jesus.</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:38.634
- Look at it.
- What?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.677
I said look at it.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.017
I said-- don't you dare
look me in the eyes.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.603
Look at it.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.815
Don't-- don't you look me
in the eyes, I said.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.604
- Look at it.
- This is crazy.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.445
You want to see crazy, son?
Look-- look at it--

28:53.607 --> 28:55.860
- Okay, okay.
- --with both eyes, both eyes.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.996
Now don't you look up.
Don't you even think about looking up.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.202
That's it.
You keep staring at it.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.288
You want to be a real man?

29:03.450 --> 29:06.545
You start by studying
a real man.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.580
That's right.
Take it all in.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.546
Pretty impressive, huh?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.085
You know the sad part, son?

29:13.252 --> 29:15.220
You're smart enough
to be running that place.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.974
But what have you done there,
at that little tire company?

29:19.132 --> 29:20.759
( Muttering )

29:20.926 --> 29:23.020
Last summer,
they were thinking about

29:23.178 --> 29:24.805
giving me my own
parking space.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.646
Just like I thought.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.187
You haven't done shit
and you never will.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.321
Oh, and, Rodney,

29:33.480 --> 29:35.323
I just got you
to stare at my penis.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.655
( laughing )
Unbelievable.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.164
Where have you been?

29:43.323 --> 29:46.497
I was in the bathroom having
a heart-to-heart with your father.

29:46.660 --> 29:49.254
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah. No, we talked.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.132
He threatened me, made me stare
at his penis the whole time--

29:52.291 --> 29:54.635
you know, typical future son-in-law,
father-in-law kind of stuff.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.511
Okay, honey,
what's wrong with you?

29:56.670 --> 29:59.469
You're acting weird.
You're sweating. You're pale.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.349
Are you sick?

30:01.508 --> 30:03.351
No, no, I'm not sick.
I'm just stressed out

30:03.510 --> 30:05.353
with work--
stupid work stuff, okay?

30:05.512 --> 30:07.014
I've been meaning to tell you.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.352
It's just not the right place
to tell you--

30:08.515 --> 30:10.313
- right here, you know?
- What?

30:12.227 --> 30:14.650
Look, something big
went down at work.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.860
Okay '

30:16.023 --> 30:18.367
Why don't you share your big
work news with everybody, Rodney?

30:18.525 --> 30:21.153
Oh, no, that's all right, J.R.
No one wants to hear about that stuff.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.369
Sure, they do-- I mean, especially
if it's about your parking spot.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.875
No, it's all right.
Really, no one wants to hear--

30:27.034 --> 30:28.536
- No, no, no, no.
- ( glass clinks)

30:28.702 --> 30:31.751
Attention, everyone.
Apparently Rodney has

30:31.913 --> 30:34.382
some very big work news
he'd like to share with all of us.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.545
No, no, really, J.R.
It's really not-- it's so boring.

30:37.711 --> 30:40.055
You don't want to hear about it.
Party on.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.715
Baby, it's okay.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.475
We're all family here.
What is it?

30:43.633 --> 30:45.556
Yeah, family, Rodney.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.687
- I got a promotion.
- Oh, honey.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.776
- Yes.
- That's great.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.157
I'm so happy for you.
Why didn't you tell me?

30:59.316 --> 31:01.239
Oh, I wanted to surprise you,
you know?

31:01.401 --> 31:04.075
<i>-</i> Jennifer: Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

31:06.114 --> 31:09.493
-( Beeps )
- Radio D.J.: It's Monday. Wake up--

31:18.585 --> 31:22.089
J' When your feet hit the street,
does your heart start to sink J'

31:22.255 --> 31:24.132
J' Knowing all
that you've been in? J'

31:24.299 --> 31:25.926
( blows horn )

31:26.093 --> 31:28.596
Mike, come on.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.606
J' When the high starts to fade J'

31:31.765 --> 31:35.486
J' If the boys want to die,
you let 'em... J'

31:35.644 --> 31:38.318
That's it!
You are a terrible secretary.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.357
You know that.
I know that.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.027
Next thing you know, you're gonna be
cleaning out the fucking shitter.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.787
J' When you're staring
out the front J'

31:45.946 --> 31:49.621
J' You might die young... J'

32:03.296 --> 32:05.640
( line beeping )

32:10.011 --> 32:11.888
<i>Jesus.</i>

32:12.055 --> 32:14.057
Help. Help.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.520
Listen, I'm gonna tell you one thing:
You don't know how to type.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.484
You don't know how to fax.
I'll tell you why you can't do it later.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.398
'Cause there ain't gonna be
a fucking later.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.158
You're a sorry
piece of shit.

32:24.818 --> 32:28.163
J' We're out on the other side
tonight J'

32:28.321 --> 32:31.871
J' Standing on the edge
and sleeping on tracks J'

32:32.033 --> 32:35.082
J' Falling off the ledge,
slipping through cracks J'

32:35.245 --> 32:37.919
J' Another night,
another night J'

32:38.081 --> 32:41.176
J' Out on the other side... J'

32:41.334 --> 32:43.928
( men lau Qh' om mg )

32:45.797 --> 32:49.017
Ow. My balls hurt
from spilling coffee--

32:49.176 --> 32:51.019
third-degree burns.

32:51.178 --> 32:54.182
Well, at least your hands
aren't covered in paper cuts

32:54.347 --> 32:55.724
from filing all day.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.189
Oh, my God, those are nasty.
You should get that checked out.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.668
Rough week, girls?

33:17.245 --> 33:18.713
See you Monday.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.170
We can't keep going on
like this.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.755
There's got to be
a better way.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.215
No.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.424
<i>Yes.</i>

33:25.587 --> 33:27.385
- No.
- Yes.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.174
It's our only shot.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.014
<i>Let's go.</i>

33:32.636 --> 33:34.559
Fuck.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.853
- He's sensitive.
- He's not.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.068
Hey, guys.
We're here for the book club.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.575
Jane invited us.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.245
I did,

33:50.403 --> 33:52.280
but that was
before Mike said

33:52.447 --> 33:54.324
that he likes
to go to bars with--

33:54.491 --> 33:56.368
I don't know.
What was it?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.084
Half-naked women
swinging on poles?

33:59.246 --> 34:00.748
Oh, no, he didn't.

34:00.914 --> 34:04.418
Ain't no half-naked women
swinging around on no poles here.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.585
Mm-mm.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.925
A couple more of these, and I can
make that happen for you, Betty.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.637
( laughs )

34:10.799 --> 34:12.927
- You know I will.
- Save it.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.972
We just wanted to say
that we realize

34:16.137 --> 34:18.639
that we've treated you
pretty shitty over these years.

34:18.806 --> 34:22.027
<i>-</i> Oh, pretty shitty?
- Okay, fine. Very shitty.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.483
- And we're really sorry for that.
- Yeah.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.149
We had no idea how hard yourjobs
were until this week.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.487
Castro is making our lives
a living hell.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.995
We suck as secretaries.

34:32.152 --> 34:34.781
I mean, look at this guy's hands.
Look at these paper cuts.

34:34.947 --> 34:37.792
We just really are
at the point

34:37.951 --> 34:41.501
that we'd love to have
a little bit of your help, please.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.132
They look infected.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.918
What do you think, Jane?

34:49.129 --> 34:51.097
Well, maybe we could help.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.888
What's in it for us?

34:58.179 --> 35:00.307
An-- anything you want.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.397
<i>-</i> What-- what can we help you with?
- Yeah, what've you got?

35:05.312 --> 35:07.155
I don't want to hear it.

35:07.314 --> 35:08.987
I'm serious.
I'm really upset right now.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.151
Oh, come on, the secretary league
has some good players.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.695
Don't even.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.489
This is some "League of Their Own"
bullshit, and you know it.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.999
See "All My Children" yesterday?

35:18.158 --> 35:21.332
Come on, pretty girl, right here.
Tina, come on--

35:23.788 --> 35:25.665
Have they even won a game?

35:25.832 --> 35:28.381
No, I don't think so.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.341
Well, let's get this over with.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.678
(sighs )

35:35.258 --> 35:37.260
( game playing on TV)

35:39.262 --> 35:41.139
Oh, hi, honey.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.478
<i>- L-ley-
- HEY-</i>

35:42.641 --> 35:44.860
What are you doing
home so early?

35:45.018 --> 35:46.861
I thought tonight was softball.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.024
Yeah, it was. I just didn't feel
like going after, that's all.

35:50.190 --> 35:53.239
- Oh, that's a first.
- Yeah.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.028
Oh, let me get this.
Give me your uniform.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.789
Oh, no, I got these.
They're just covered in mud

35:57.947 --> 35:59.949
You don't want to touch them.
What's all this?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.710
Oh, sample wedding invitations.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.713
I think I have narrowed it down
to the two that I like.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.216
These-- I love the font for sure,

36:08.375 --> 36:11.049
but I don't know.
It might be a little busy. And--

36:11.211 --> 36:13.714
honey, what do you think?

36:16.341 --> 36:19.891
That's incredible.
That's-- that's--

36:20.053 --> 36:22.556
is this Helvetica?
That's a beautiful font.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.225
What is it made from?
Is it, like, papyrus?

36:25.392 --> 36:27.269
You're so full of shit.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.903
- What?
- Go watch the game.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.109
<i>-</i> Really?
- Oh, yeah.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.363
- You're the best.
- I know.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.900
Can I get a kiss?

36:33.066 --> 36:34.443
We'll do this tomorrow?

36:34.609 --> 36:35.906
- Okay.
- Saturday.

36:36.069 --> 36:39.243
Don't turn your uniform
pink again.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.460
It's your wedding.
She wants you to be involved.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.245
So I'm the worst fiancé
of all time.

36:45.412 --> 36:47.414
I'm just not into this
wedding planning stuff.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.129
Use your imagination.
Think of it as, like, a bitchin' party

36:50.291 --> 36:52.168
with neon lights
and techno music.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.463
Mikey, Mikey, we're planning
my wedding, not a frat party.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.257
J' When you want it,
you get it J'

36:57.424 --> 36:59.426
J' 'Cause I am
sugar daddy's little girl J'

36:59.592 --> 37:02.266
J' Sugar, sugar, sugar,
I'm sugar daddy's girl... J'

37:02.429 --> 37:04.773
We get demoted
and he gets a new car?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.774
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.436
Yeah, it's Ken Castro.

37:09.602 --> 37:12.856
- No, just Ken.
- ( chirps )

37:13.022 --> 37:16.743
Wait, does it come in ultra deluxe?
How about super ultra deluxe?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.825
Hey, somebody want
to pick up that sign?

37:19.988 --> 37:23.242
You know, Betty, there's a rule
against eating at your desk.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.378
And let me tell you,
if you worked as hard as you ate,

37:26.536 --> 37:28.959
maybe you'd get
somewhere in life, maybe.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.591
Unless of course your goal is
to have your own gravitational pull

37:31.750 --> 37:32.922
and become the 10th planet.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.711
Then congratulations,
you're well on your way.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.630
We'll have to clear
the desk out a little bit.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.469
Hey, Castro, why don't you
lay off, man? Come on.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.633
Stay out of this, McAdams.
This doesn't concern you.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.145
Why don't you and Murphy go
jerk each other off in the copy room?

37:44.304 --> 37:46.147
Now from now on,

37:46.306 --> 37:48.650
you eat only at lunch
or on your break.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.651
You got me?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.438
Hey, do you got me?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.491
Yes, Mr. Castro.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.572
Now if you'll excuse me,

37:58.735 --> 38:00.954
I gotta go drop the kids off
at the pool.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.834
Why do you let him
talk to you like that?

38:05.992 --> 38:07.494
You should stand up
for yourself.

38:07.660 --> 38:10.288
What am I supposed to do?
Sue?

38:10.455 --> 38:13.629
I need this job.
Besides, he ain't lying.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.341
Look at me.
All I do is eat.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.049
Rodney:
That's right. Stretch it out.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.345
Are you guys sure about this?
I ain't never worked out before.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.684
Come on, when we're done with you,
you're gonna look like Star Jones.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.350
And that's a good thing?
She got all crazy when she got skinny.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.565
Hey, you gotta take
the good with the bad.

38:32.727 --> 38:37.028
Shit, I guess I'd rather be crazy
and skinny than fat and miserable.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.693
- There you go.
- Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.861
All right, that's our girl.
Come on now, go break a sweat.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.622
<i>-</i> Okay.
- Ready? And go!

38:46.449 --> 38:48.952
- There you go.
- There you go. Light on your toes.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.375
Take it easy at first.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.462
23 minutes, 42 seconds.
One more lap.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.092
Rodney:
Lance Armstrong would be proud.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.221
Good job, Betty.
You run like a champion.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.716
This workout stuff's fun.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.052
I like it.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.971
You think we're pushing her
too hard?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.686
Nah. Look at her.
She's having a ball out there.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.943
She's like a wild stallion.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.445
( Chuckles )

39:15.603 --> 39:17.776
<i>-</i> Oh, Lordy.
- Oh, Shit.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.525
Okay, people,

39:20.692 --> 39:24.242
rules are going to be strictly
enforced at this company now.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.657
It is 8:58, people.

39:26.823 --> 39:30.498
That means you have two minutes
to get inside and get to your desk,

39:30.660 --> 39:33.129
'cause we start at 9:00 sharp.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.632
Oh, hey.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.877
Hey, uh, uh...

39:39.043 --> 39:40.420
Soon-Yi, right?

39:40.587 --> 39:42.089
- It's Olivia.
- Oh.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.757
<i>-</i> Mr. Castro, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:43.923 --> 39:47.018
- Who's this little guy?
- Oh, this is my son Jack.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.271
I tried to get him a sitter for today,
but she's in school.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.432
So you're just gonna bring him
up to the office?

39:52.599 --> 39:55.523
- He's so quiet.
- Yeah, he does look quiet.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.438
Hey, I've got a great idea--
get that thing out of here.

39:58.605 --> 40:00.949
Move it. Get it back home.
Get rid of it.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.656
All right, come on, folks,
let's move it.

40:05.612 --> 40:06.659
( Hisses )

40:06.821 --> 40:08.448
Thank you very much.
Have a great day.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.162
Thanks.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.702
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.121
You're here, like, every freakin' day.
What gives?

40:14.287 --> 40:16.164
Nothing gives.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.333
Why don't you put the bong down
and go make some coffee?

40:20.460 --> 40:22.838
You're, like, their coffee bitch?

40:23.004 --> 40:25.177
What did you just call me?
Coffee bitch?

40:25.340 --> 40:27.217
Ha ha, that's funny, yeah.
No, go ahead, keep talking.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.886
Call me a coffee bitch one more time.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

40:30.053 --> 40:33.057
I will pole-vault over this counter
and shove a cappuccino up your ass.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.725
You got it?
No one calls me coffee bitch.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.644
Whatever.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.653
There he is.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.485
Coffee bitch in the house.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.867
Oh, there's my little girl,
my favorite secretary.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.823
Why don't you take me a memo--
suck my co--

40:45.985 --> 40:48.704
Argh! Jesus!
I told you, double-cup it.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.491
I have very tender fingers.
I need two cups, you dumb dummy.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.331
What took you so long?

40:53.493 --> 40:57.088
This better be decaf. You know,
regular messes up my boner meds.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.168
Oh, shit.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.838
Hey, O'Donnell, I want that report
on my desk in an hour. You got it?

41:05.004 --> 41:07.598
<i>-</i> What-- what report?
- Just do it, O'Donnell.

41:07.757 --> 41:10.010
Shit, did I forget something?

41:11.010 --> 41:12.887
Hi, honey.
What are you doing here?

41:13.054 --> 41:15.978
I don't know. I thought I'd, you know,
stop in and surprise you.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.605
So which one's
your new office?

41:18.768 --> 41:20.520
Oh, baby, you don't want
to see my office.

41:20.687 --> 41:21.859
- It's so boring.
- I do.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.568
No, please. It's just--
it's a desk. It's a chair

41:23.731 --> 41:25.404
They painted it today.
The fumes are nasty.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.910
Wait, I don't care
if they painted it.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.492
No, but they're really bad.
It's toxic. You'll faint. You'll faint.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.952
I promise.
It's horrible in there.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.288
Oh, God.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.420
Okay, if I can't see your office,
then let me take you to lunch.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.455
Where's Nancy?

41:39.622 --> 41:42.171
Uh, you know what?
Today's really not so good for me.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.335
I've got a lot going on.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.129
I don't think--

41:46.295 --> 41:48.764
<i>-</i> What, you can't take a lunch?
- I'd really like to, but--

41:48.923 --> 41:50.641
- Mr. McAdams.
- What?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.768
They're looking for you
in the conference room

41:52.927 --> 41:54.895
for your lunch meeting.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.935
Oh. Oh, my lunch meeting.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.523
Of course.
Thank you, Jane.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.733
Uh-huh, sure.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.738
Thank you, Jane.
My lunch meeting.

42:04.897 --> 42:06.365
See, I've got this big
lunch meeting.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.242
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just not a good day.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.405
I understand.
Okay, well, I will see you tonight.

42:11.571 --> 42:12.618
Yes. Yes, you will.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.157
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:14.323 --> 42:17.543
So I'm gonna go
back to work.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.579
I'm not gonna like it.

42:19.746 --> 42:22.590
- Rodney.
- Yeah?

42:22.749 --> 42:25.047
I'm so proud of you.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.928
I really am.
The whole promotion and everything--

42:28.087 --> 42:31.432
I'm just-- I just wanted
to tell you that.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.093
Thanks.

42:33.259 --> 42:36.183
Okay, don't work too hard.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.222
Bye.

42:43.311 --> 42:46.440
That was one hell of a save
back there, Jane.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.950
Thanks for that.
What a great bluff.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.110
These idiots should have you
working in sales.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.494
Oh, please.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.156
I've been trying to get in sales
here for 10 years now.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.041
It'll never happen.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.545
In case you hadn't noticed, women
don't get promoted in this company.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.456
Rodney, this is still
an old-fashioned tire company.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.967
It's a boys' club.
You know that.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.045
Your girlfriend
doesn't know, does she?

43:09.212 --> 43:12.136
Oh, no, that's my fiancée.

43:12.298 --> 43:13.641
Oh.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.849
Yeah. And I am
gonna tell her,

43:17.011 --> 43:18.513
maybe.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.521
Well, it's complicated.
Her father wants to crush my nuts.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.651
Well, that'll smart.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.197
She's your fiancée--
priorities.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.030
Take care of that,
nuts and all.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.791
Frank: Nancy, get in here
and light my cigarette,

43:38.950 --> 43:40.793
<i>-</i> you piece of shit.
- Yes, sir.

43:46.415 --> 43:49.043
Okay, this report
is incomplete.

43:49.210 --> 43:51.759
And the pages
aren't even in order.

43:52.964 --> 43:56.059
And is some of this
written in pencil?

43:56.217 --> 43:57.810
Well, the ink on my printer
went out, so...

43:57.969 --> 44:00.017
I don't know how to work
the cartridge thingy.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.022
You're unbelievable.

44:02.181 --> 44:04.058
Okay, yesterday, you spilled

44:04.225 --> 44:06.853
a full box of paper clips
into my paper shredder.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.362
- It was an accident.
- And before that,

44:08.521 --> 44:10.694
you connected my conference call
to a Chinese restaurant.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.530
Ordering your Chinese takeout.

44:12.692 --> 44:14.694
And there were
a lot of lines going,

44:14.861 --> 44:16.363
and one of them was
a three-way call and--

44:16.529 --> 44:18.623
Okay, you know what?
Speaking of three-way,

44:18.781 --> 44:22.206
what about the porn
that you synced to my BlackBerry?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.539
Are you sure that wasn't
already there?

44:26.706 --> 44:29.300
Which, by the way,
I cannot get off.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.926
- ( Knocks on door)
- Yes?

44:31.085 --> 44:32.211
Excuse me, Miss Holland.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.051
I just wondered if I could
borrow Mike for a minute.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.806
I've got an errand
I need him to run.

44:35.965 --> 44:37.967
Don't you have your own
secretary, Kenny?

44:38.134 --> 44:39.351
- Ken.
- It's Ken.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.387
And she's a bit preoccupied.

44:41.554 --> 44:44.728
I got her over at my place
waiting for the cable guy, so...

44:44.891 --> 44:46.268
Fine. Go.

44:46.434 --> 44:48.402
All right, cleaned and pressed
this time, all right?

44:48.561 --> 44:49.983
- And tell them--
- Don't push it, Kenny.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.444
You don't push it.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.156
New secretaries--

44:55.318 --> 44:58.743
sometimes it takes a little bit
to break 'em in, you know?

44:58.905 --> 44:59.997
Not really.

45:00.156 --> 45:02.659
I don't send my secretaries out
on personal errands.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.202
Oh.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.245
Well, you should.
It's fantastic.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.756
It's like having
little elves, you know?

45:08.915 --> 45:12.795
All right, <i>so</i> how's it going?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.257
How are you liking Treadline?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.798
<i>-</i> A fun group, huh?
- Yes, very fun.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.434
Yeah, we try to-- we try to,
you know, have fun.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.311
Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay, thanks.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.097
Sometimes, you know,
we'll go after work

45:24.263 --> 45:26.766
and we'll go to Ding Dongs and--
you know, they have a sports--

45:26.933 --> 45:28.856
- Thank you, no.
- Oh, you gotta go. It's fun.

45:29.018 --> 45:31.862
I was gonna get a group of people--
maybe not even a group.

45:32.021 --> 45:34.820
You don't want to get overwhelmed.
Why don't we go down-- the two of us?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.108
- Huh?
- No.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.949
Anyway, I'm-- you know,
I'm over in that side of the hall.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.079
And my door is always
open to you.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.708
Okay, could you--
could you close my door?

45:43.866 --> 45:44.958
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

45:45.117 --> 45:47.290
You know, I meant that
in, like, a spiritual way,

45:47.453 --> 45:49.876
so that it was like, you know--
it's a symbolic thing.

45:50.039 --> 45:53.964
So the door may be closed,
but, hey, it's open to you.

45:54.126 --> 45:56.299
You know, could you
open the door,

45:56.462 --> 45:59.011
you out, close?
Than ks.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.596
<i>-</i> Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, you're busy.
- Yes, very busy.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.013
Um, okay.
Well, I will let you get to it.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.476
<i>-</i> Okay, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.357
Goodbye.
Thank you, Ken.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.984
Okay. Hey, do you like
Greek food?

46:10.142 --> 46:11.644
No, no, I don't eat.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.154
- Lamb?
- No.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.565
<i>-</i> A vegetarian, eh?
- Okay. Uh-huh. Bye-bye.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.326
<i>-</i> Ship up, shape out.
- "Ship out." Thank you.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.328
Do you--
do you like movies?

46:21.487 --> 46:23.330
No. No, I don't.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.741
- How about TV?
- No.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.626
All right.
Um, well, if you get hungry--

46:27.785 --> 46:29.958
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- Are you fixed good for cash?

46:30.121 --> 46:32.670
- I'm great. Thank you so much.
- Okay. All right.

46:32.832 --> 46:34.505
Goodbye.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.094
Goodbye. Okay.

46:37.253 --> 46:39.096
- Ken: This will be it.
- That's it.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.303
( Exhales )
Wow.

46:41.465 --> 46:43.888
You should have seen her.
I mean, she completely bailed me out.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.598
Well, that is great for you.

46:45.761 --> 46:48.184
Meanwhile, my boss thinks
I'm an idiot

46:48.347 --> 46:51.351
and Castro's got me running around
like his personal slave.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.981
The good news is

46:57.148 --> 46:59.071
I've dropped, like, two sizes
drinking this stuff.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.782
(woman sobbing )

47:18.878 --> 47:20.755
(sniffling )

47:20.921 --> 47:23.015
So at dinner

47:23.174 --> 47:26.769
we got really buzzed
off Dreamsicle daiquiris.

47:26.927 --> 47:29.350
It was really romantic.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.107
And then we did
the whole movie thing.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.564
And he put his arm
around me

47:34.727 --> 47:36.729
and we shared a Coke.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.773
And I looked up
at the screen.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.782
There were those cute little
snack guys

47:40.941 --> 47:42.818
telling you to go
to the lobby

47:42.985 --> 47:44.783
and get yourselves a treat.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.664
And so I was like,
"Hell, yeah, he deserves a treat."

47:47.823 --> 47:50.167
You know, so I just gave him
a quick hand job

47:50.326 --> 47:52.829
underneath his popcorn bowl.

47:52.995 --> 47:56.625
And then we went
back to his house.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.920
And it was so amazing,
you guys.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.965
We did it twice
on the balcony.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.304
And the second time
he had me doggy-style.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.140
And it was so beautiful.

48:08.302 --> 48:10.805
We were looking over
the city lights.

48:10.971 --> 48:14.271
And the exact moment
he spooged,

48:14.433 --> 48:16.481
a shooting star went by.

48:16.644 --> 48:19.944
It was magical,

48:20.106 --> 48:22.985
like a fucking Disney movie.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.997
But then I come in here today

48:28.155 --> 48:30.999
and he completely ignores me.

48:31.158 --> 48:35.834
It's like he just used me
for sex or something.

48:35.996 --> 48:39.341
All the guys here
are such jerks.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.003
( Sobbing )

48:46.257 --> 48:49.352
And she's screaming,
"Oh, O'Donnell, you're so big."

48:49.510 --> 48:52.639
And I'm like, "Damn straight I am."
And she's like--

48:52.805 --> 48:55.854
- O'Donnell, O'Donnell,
- O'Donnell, your ass is mine.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.860
<i>-</i> Hey, what's up, guys?
- Don't "What's up" us.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.021
We just finished having a little
conversation with our friend Tina.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.405
You remember
who Tina is, don't you?

49:02.565 --> 49:04.533
Come on, guys,
I mean, that chick's a whore.

49:04.692 --> 49:06.194
Everybody in the office
has boned her.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.408
She's not a whore.
She's an angel.

49:08.571 --> 49:11.871
- ( Coughing )
- Here's what's gonna happen:

49:12.032 --> 49:14.410
You're gonna apologize and then
you're gonna buy her some flowers.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.204
Yeah, big ones.
Two dozen red roses.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.873
Do you have any idea
how much that's gonna cost me?

49:19.039 --> 49:23.215
Okay, man, just put down the stapler.
Man, just put down the stapler.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.095
( Coughing )

49:25.254 --> 49:26.801
And that goes for the rest
of you clowns.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.717
Any of you mess with our girls--
you'll have to deal with us.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.397
Hell, yeah.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.190
Maybe we can get her into,
like, an AA program

49:40.352 --> 49:42.025
for women addicted to dick.

49:42.188 --> 49:45.032
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Like DA-- Dicks Anonymous?

49:45.191 --> 49:46.864
Yeah.

49:48.194 --> 49:50.447
( Birds screeching )

49:56.452 --> 49:58.170
This is a great
change of pace, Earl.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.752
Actually, do you mind if I call
you Earl? Can I call you Earl?

50:00.915 --> 50:02.462
Actually, no, you can't.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.844
See, Rodney,

50:05.002 --> 50:07.096
I ain't like other bosses.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.222
I like to get out of the office

50:09.381 --> 50:11.554
every once in a while
and have some fun.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.846
Oh, I love fun.
Fun and me are like best pals.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.233
Everybody, this is Rodney.

50:19.391 --> 50:22.235
Rodney, this here is
the killing crew.

50:22.394 --> 50:25.773
Rodney, we're gonna give you
approximately--

50:25.940 --> 50:28.739
what do you think, boys?
About five minutes?

50:28.901 --> 50:32.246
We're gonna give you
a five-minute head start.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.578
A five-minute head start
for what?

50:36.700 --> 50:39.624
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
-( men laughing)

50:39.787 --> 50:43.667
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

50:43.832 --> 50:45.926
You're our prey today, son.

50:47.628 --> 50:50.427
You'd best get moving, boy.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.808
- ( Guns clicking )
- Oh, shit.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.265
Ow.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.646
Hmm.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.398
You know what?
Fuck the five minutes.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.184
Let's go get some
fresh meat, boys.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.773
Hooah!

51:10.484 --> 51:12.486
( Phone ringing )

51:13.654 --> 51:14.997
- Hello.
- Mike: Hey, where are you?

51:15.155 --> 51:16.498
It's lunchtime.
I'm starving.

51:16.657 --> 51:18.159
I'm about ready to eat
this freakin' memo pad.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.123
Yeah, I'm not actually gonna
make lunch today.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.788
I've got a bit of a situation
here, Mikey.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.548
- Are you running?
- Yes, I'm fucking running.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.010
Oh, fuck.

51:29.003 --> 51:31.847
Hey, guys.
Hey, you win.

51:32.006 --> 51:34.008
<i>-</i> Oh, shit.
- Light him up.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.679
( Rodney screaming )

51:37.845 --> 51:40.314
Argh! Ow. Ow.

51:45.477 --> 51:48.697
Paintball? It all just seems
a little macho to me.

51:48.856 --> 51:52.326
Honey, I told you it was a bonding
exercise with my sales team.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.953
Besides, I'm their boss.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.160
They have to know
that I'm a great leader,

51:57.323 --> 52:01.044
that I can kick some ass, which,
by the way, is exactly what I did.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.704
Are you sure it wasn't
the other way around?

52:04.997 --> 52:07.375
Oh, these?
Are you kidding me?

52:07.541 --> 52:10.215
You know what these are?
These are defensive wounds, okay?

52:10.377 --> 52:12.755
I got these
shielding my teammates.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.800
Oh, okay, so you were--

52:15.966 --> 52:17.559
you were, like,
protecting them?

52:17.718 --> 52:19.391
Yes. Yes, hell, yeah.

52:19.553 --> 52:21.476
- That's hot.
- Yeah. You like that?

52:21.639 --> 52:23.061
That's really hot.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.225
Really hot? You want me to show
you exactly how I did it?

52:25.392 --> 52:27.190
- I do.
- Okay, put that magazine down.

52:27.353 --> 52:28.730
Here I come.

52:28.896 --> 52:30.364
<i>-</i> Come here.
- It's all this paint.

52:30.522 --> 52:32.069
<i>-</i> Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Oh, honey.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.735
- Ow. Fuck.
- Honey, oh.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.745
No, no, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

52:36.904 --> 52:38.872
Can I get you some ice?

52:39.031 --> 52:41.284
No, I need, like, an ice suit.

52:42.618 --> 52:43.790
So let me get this straight:

52:43.952 --> 52:45.954
your boss stalked you through
the woods like a fucking ferret

52:46.121 --> 52:48.419
and you're gonna tell Jennifer
that it was a training exercise?

52:48.582 --> 52:50.425
I had to tell her something.
She's getting suspicious.

52:50.584 --> 52:51.927
- Whoa.
- Oh.

52:52.086 --> 52:55.135
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh-uh.

52:55.297 --> 52:57.265
Good morning, ladies.

52:57.424 --> 52:58.892
Morning, Kenny.
How's your ass?

52:59.051 --> 53:00.724
Was your boyfriend
gentle on you last night?

53:00.886 --> 53:02.638
Ha ha, you're a real
comedian, Murphy.

53:02.805 --> 53:05.274
And it's Ken, God damn it.
How many times I gotta tell you that?

53:05.432 --> 53:08.811
Oh, we're sorry. How about Fuckface?
Does that work for you?

53:08.977 --> 53:10.399
Blow a horse, McAdams.

53:10.562 --> 53:12.280
No, I'm good.
I'll leave the animal rape to you.

53:12.439 --> 53:16.569
Uh, it's not rape if you blow something.
That's not rape.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.112
What is with the roadblock?

53:18.278 --> 53:20.406
Does Treadline have some al-Qaeda
on the loose or what's up?

53:20.572 --> 53:22.745
You know, corporate asked me
to make some cutbacks,

53:22.908 --> 53:25.002
so I thought I'd start with
secretary parking.

53:25.160 --> 53:28.130
- These are all rental spaces.
- Okay, where are we supposed to park?

53:28.288 --> 53:31.337
All the secretaries are gonna be able
to park on Walnut.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.673
<i>-</i> Walnut?
- That's, like, a mile walk from here.

53:33.836 --> 53:35.838
Castro, it's, like, 100
outside today.

53:36.004 --> 53:38.803
I know.
It's a real scorcher, isn't it?

53:38.966 --> 53:41.640
I don't know if it's been this hot
in a long time--

53:41.802 --> 53:43.224
probably global warming.

53:43.387 --> 53:45.310
You should see what
my nutsack feels like.

53:45.472 --> 53:48.817
All right, have fun walking,
bitches.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.359
Castro is gonna pay for this. It's like
the fucking Sahara out here today.

53:56.525 --> 53:59.995
Tell me about it. I'm definitely
gonna have swamp ass all day now.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.497
You and me both.

54:01.655 --> 54:04.329
My front side
ain't doing too good either.

54:13.625 --> 54:16.799
Yes, Miss Holland would like to know
if she can reschedule her 2:00, please.

54:16.962 --> 54:20.341
There he is, right on time,
going to take his morning shit.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.635
Just like clockwork.
This guy is so predictable.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.640
Good morning.
Mr. Frank's office.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.900
No, he's not in.
Can I take a message?

54:30.058 --> 54:32.277
Will do.
Thank you.

54:41.361 --> 54:44.535
Break it up, ladies.
This isn't "The View."

54:56.001 --> 54:58.220
( phone rings )

54:58.378 --> 55:00.597
Hello. Mr. Castro's office.

55:00.756 --> 55:03.384
- He's in.
- Got ya.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.119
What the fuck is this?

55:31.912 --> 55:33.664
<i>-</i> Which one is it?
- How the fuck should I know?

55:33.831 --> 55:35.549
I'm not a scientist.
This shit's complicated.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.210
- Whatever. Just turn them all.
- All right.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.928
' ( Qrunts )
'( Plops )

55:43.090 --> 55:44.842
(sighs )

55:45.008 --> 55:47.261
Right there.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.607
( Pipes clanking )

55:52.766 --> 55:55.269
Yeah, that's good.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.701
Oh, fudge.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.286
( Low rumbling )

56:08.448 --> 56:09.825
Oh!

56:09.992 --> 56:11.209
( Cheering )

56:11.368 --> 56:13.245
( screaming )

56:14.913 --> 56:18.133
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Jesus!

56:18.292 --> 56:20.294
( Screaming )
Oh, Jesus!

56:21.795 --> 56:23.923
Oh, it's going up my nose.
Oh, mother.

56:26.133 --> 56:27.430
What the shit?

56:27.593 --> 56:29.687
Oh.

56:29.845 --> 56:33.566
No' no, no,

56:36.310 --> 56:37.778
Oh, shit.

56:37.936 --> 56:40.109
Oh, my-- fuck.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.983
Shh. Go back.

56:51.158 --> 56:52.785
She's got promise.

56:56.455 --> 56:58.833
J' I've been watching the birds
as they go J'

56:58.999 --> 57:01.297
J' And I've been keeping
my bank account low J'

57:01.460 --> 57:03.133
J' I've been keeping
my end of the deal... J'

57:03.295 --> 57:05.969
- ( crowd cheering )
- J' With St. Anthony and St. Thomas J'

57:06.131 --> 57:08.680
J' My little sister gave it
a hell of a try J'

57:08.842 --> 57:10.970
J' You know, I hear it gets worse
when you die J'

57:11.136 --> 57:13.480
J' I can't believe you got me
waiting for another year J'

57:13.639 --> 57:15.687
J' But if you ever make it back,
I'll be here J'

57:15.849 --> 57:17.851
J' And I'll be ready,
I promise <i>I</i>

57:20.896 --> 57:23.194
J' I promise... J'

57:24.524 --> 57:26.026
Open all the way.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.820
J' I hear your voice J'

57:27.986 --> 57:30.409
J' Say things to me J'

57:30.572 --> 57:32.700
J' But I get up for nothing J'

57:32.866 --> 57:34.368
J' 'Cause I'm afraid to see... J'

57:34.534 --> 57:36.377
- No, no, no, no.
- Tina.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.710
J' Every day is so twisted,
I know you won't give in J'

57:39.873 --> 57:42.547
J' But I'll still be here J'

57:42.709 --> 57:45.053
J' If you want me back again J'

57:45.212 --> 57:47.385
- J' I promise... J'
- Whoa, shit.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.848
J' I promise... J'

58:04.982 --> 58:06.859

J' Water the flowers
above the sink sometimes J'

58:09.695 --> 58:11.823
J' I listen to your records J'

58:11.989 --> 58:14.242
J' Do you still have mine? J'

58:14.408 --> 58:15.910
J' Every day is so twisted... J'

58:16.076 --> 58:18.579
-( Betty giggling )
- J' I know you won't give in J'

58:18.745 --> 58:21.544
J' So I promise not to try J'

58:21.707 --> 58:23.709
- J' To make it breathe again... J'
- Mr. Frank's office.

58:23.875 --> 58:26.298
- Here he is right now.
- J' I promise... J'

58:48.608 --> 58:50.451
Mike?

58:50.610 --> 58:52.408
Oh, hey.

58:52.571 --> 58:54.994
Don't mind me.

58:55.157 --> 58:58.752
Okay. Excuse me, I just meant
to take this with me on Friday.

58:58.910 --> 59:01.413
What are you doing here
on a Saturday?

59:01.580 --> 59:05.005
Just catching up
on some work, organizing.

59:05.167 --> 59:08.046
Nobody likes
a sloppy secretary.

59:09.463 --> 59:11.306
Right.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.810
Okay.
( chuckles )

59:18.805 --> 59:20.682
Hey!

59:20.849 --> 59:23.022
Are you hungry?

59:23.185 --> 59:26.109
Do you want to maybe
grab some lunch?

59:27.355 --> 59:28.823
Yeah.

59:28.982 --> 59:32.737
<i>-</i> Yeah?
- Yeah. Now?

59:32.903 --> 59:34.530
( Chuckles )

59:34.696 --> 59:38.496
Oh. Oh! Good job.

59:38.658 --> 59:42.504
When you said, "lunch,"
I didn't expect you to take me bowling.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.506
Okay, first of all,
despite this being a bowling alley,

59:45.665 --> 59:47.633
it happens to serve
the best pizza in the city.

59:47.793 --> 59:51.388
And second, you know,
I've been kind of hard on you.

59:51.546 --> 59:53.844
And lately you've really
stepped it up.

59:54.007 --> 59:58.308
So, I don't know,
I guess it's the least I can do.

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.936
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.822
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.402
Yeah !

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:12.363
<i>-</i> Size seven.
- Okay.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:17.031
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.870
Thanks for this.
It was really fun.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.909
Yeah, it was fun.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.828
But, listen, you know,

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.213
you might not want to mention this
to anybody in the office.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.749
Technically, I'm your boss.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.542
Yeah, right, that's true.
They might think

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.551
that we were dating
or something

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.714
or that you were trying
to sexually harass me,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.804
which, you know--
which, by the way, would be fine.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.436
I'd be totally cool with that,
if, you know--

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:42.564
I mean, I wouldn't tell anybody.
I wouldn't report you.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.599
Right.

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.234
Good to know.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.441
- Yeah.
- Uh, okay.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.446
- I'm gonna get going.
- Yeah.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.825
- Okay. CR3)!
- Okay. Okay

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:57.534
Come on. God.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.373
Jesus Christ, you didn't tell me
he was coming.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.458
Honey, he wants to be
involved, okay?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.588
First of all, I didn't know
you were coming.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.920
Let's all just try
to get along today.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.426
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, honey.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.843
How's my little girl?
Let's go. Today, Rodney.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.929
Rodney: NASCAR-style.
Watch your head.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.809
Watch your head, sweetie.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.060
<i>-</i> J.R.: Okay, all in?
- Yep.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.221
- ( Tires screech )
- Whoa.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.447
I hope you boys are ready,

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.608
'cause we've got a lot
of shopping to do.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.029
Come on, rookie.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.124
Rodney: Jesus, stop fucking
hitting me, J.R.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.956
J.R.:
Come on.

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.788
These are them.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.791
Don't mess with the big fella.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.015
Mm. That's the one.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:00.642
No.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.552
-( laughing )
- I-ley, hey.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:09.481
- Yeah, I like this one.
- Okay, uh-huh.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:10.815
Yes!

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.943
Okay, so, guys,
we need to find

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:19.611
a centerpiece.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:22.702
A centerpiece for the tables--
that's what we're looking for, okay?

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.332
Okay '

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:26.702
Oh.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.712
<i>-</i> I got it first, J.R. Get your own.
- No, no, no, no, I had it first.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.544
What are you talking about?
I got my hand on it first.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:34.380
Don't mess with me, Rodney.
I'm a war veteran.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.636
What are you talking about?
You were in the Coast Guard.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.344
<i>-</i> What do you mean by that?
- Just give me the-- just give it.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.383
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:43.517
This is a store,
for God's sakes.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.850
You guys, is it possible for us
to have one day--

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:49.061
just one day
where you two get along?

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.066
- Negative.
- No.

01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:57.820
You can't keep arguing
with your future father-in-law.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.030
It's not healthy.

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:01.536
No, what's not healthy is his ability
to be such an asshole.

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.948
At least you're not falling
for your boss,

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:07.414
who, as it turns out, is cool as shit.
Totally different outside the office.

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:09.202
- What? The auditor chick? Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.962
Most girls you date
can't even add.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.714
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what's happening.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.045
I haven't wanted to go to
a strip club in, like, three weeks.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.758
Today is a big day
for Treadline.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.924
Hell, I'd say it's the biggest day
in this company's history.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.718
Any minute now
we're gonna get word

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:28.889
that we have closed
the Reilly Auto Parts deal.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.432
Yeah !

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:32.692
We're with the big dogs now.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.728
Gel Pumped!

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.692
Get fired up.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.072
Yeah.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:41.075
I know.
It's exciting stuff, huh?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.407
Yeah, I should know.
I put the deal together myself.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.744
But I can pretty much imagine
what you're all thinking,

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.750
and I'll tell you what--
I'll make it easy on you.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.252
You're welcome.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:54.460
I will be accepting cash
andlor gifts

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:57.876
as tokens of gratitude
for all the hard work I've done.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.420
Huh?

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.304
Now-- oh.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:04.057
I'm a little low.
You want to top me off?

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:06.684
Come on, sugar bottom.
You want to help me out?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.891
Yeah, honey buns, you.
That's right.

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:10.931
Get coffee for your boss.
All right, now

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.691
<i>who's got business
they want to discuss?</i>

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.103
Kline: Yeah, Ken, seems we have
an international kerfuffle--

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.317
Actually, I've got one quick thing.
I don't know who it is

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.905
that's been putting copies of the movie
"Nine to Five" on my chair,

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.662
- but it is really not cool-- not cool.
- ( men chuckling )

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.448
I said business, Murphy.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.333
Sorry, Kline.
What were you saying?

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.665
Ken, listen, seems that--

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:34.545
( men exclaim, laugh )

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.957
Jesus Christ, McAdams.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.717
This is awful. What are you trying
to do-- poison me?

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.971
Go to Biggby's,
get me some real coffee.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:47.593
Hey, coffee bitch is making a run.
Anybody want anything?

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.729
- I'm gonna get a latte, double.
- I want a grande latte with soy.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.390
O'Donnell: I need a decaf.
We've already been over the reason.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.479
- We don't need to talk about it.
- Grab me a cappuccino?

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.110
Bite me.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:03.616
Hey, look who's back
for, like, a thousandth time.

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:05.652
Let me guess:
you want some coffee?

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.696
Ain't that right,

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:09.364
coffee bitch?

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:10.748
Really?

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:16.876
Whoa.
(woman screaming )

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:19.837
Rodney:
Who's the coffee bitch now?

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:22.422
That little shit blinded me
with coffee grinds, right?

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.885
So I grabbed this stale muffin
and I hauled off a 90mph fastball.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.516
I nailed him right in the forehead
and knocked his ass out.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.348
Awesome. What's next?

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.979
Are you gonna pick a fight with
the retarded kid that works at Subway?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.640
Shut up.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.729
Ooh.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:39.019
Mike: Are those guys
from corporate?

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.608
- It's a misunderstanding.
- I hope they fired Castro.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.196
Not exactly, but they did
chew him a new a-hole.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.486
And you didn't get
fucking donuts.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:50.872
Apparently the Reilly
Auto Parts deal

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.828
fell apart at the last second.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.540
<i>-</i> Oh, shit.
- Take cover.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:58.376
( Ken yelling )

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:01.212
Fucking plant!
You stupid--

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:04.715
Wow.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.261
- Hey: guys'
- Hey.

01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:15.146
I know we call it
"the book club,"

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:17.478
but I didn't think
we actually took it seriously.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.517
Oh, no, no, it's not like that.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:23.063
I take nursing classes at night
and I've got a final coming up.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:26.028
Oh, that's nice.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:28.569
Hey!

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:30.408
Can I ask you guys
for some advice?

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.117
Yeah, sure.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.409
I mean, if it's about any kind of,
you know, women's issues,

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.794
you know, down there,

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.205
we're not technically
medically qualified to answer.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.248
Please, please forgive him.
He's a little slow.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.507
Go ahead.
What do you need? Shoot.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.419
See, I've got my anniversary
coming up

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.135
and I have no idea
what to get my husband.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:52.141
He's really difficult
to shop for and--

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.770
- Blow job
- Blow job

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:58.273
Excuse me,

01:06:58.431 --> 01:06:59.933
did you just say"?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.273
Yeah, a blow job.
You know, like a hummer, sucking off

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.734
Giving head,
smoking the bone, fellatio--

01:07:05.897 --> 01:07:07.365
it goes by many names.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.743
And it's probably the best five
minutes a man could ever ask for.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.780
That is what you should get him
for your anniversary as a present.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.289
<i>-</i> Really?
- Mmmmm.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.290
- That's it?
- That is it.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:17.666
Look at that.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:20.954
Wow, so, you know, I've been totally
overthinking this whole thing.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.838
Most women usually do.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:26.422
But, hey, no half-assing it.
You go downtown on that thing, okay?

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.678
Like you did when you first
started dating.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:31.305
Yeah, lick his balls.
That's an extra added bonus.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.262
Balls, balls--
ball-licking is awesome.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.301
You should be
writing this down.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.311
- Okay, uh...
- Licking his balls.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:41.646
- Oh, "licking his balls"?
- Yeah.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:45.108
The thing is, Bob and I--
we're into making romance.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.238
And scrotum-licking
sounds like...

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:49.616
- No, it's very romantic.
- ...some crazy Internet thing.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.367
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, you build up to romance

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:53.824
and then you start going crazy.
You gotta like it, all right?

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.910
And if you don't like it,
you gotta pretend like you like it.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.494
- No, you gotta like it.
- 'Cause he's gonna love it.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.001
What do you like in life?
What do you like to do?

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.002
Well...

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.539
oh, I love antique shopping.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.674
Antique shopping?
You gotta suck his dick

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.336
like you are antique shopping.
You know what I'm saying?

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.005
Rodney: Honestly, in your mind,
if you concentrate really hard

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:13.548
and make that cock
like an antique,

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.217
like the most beautiful antique
you've ever seen--

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.852
Are you sure a brand-new DVD player
wouldn't be better?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.228
No, fuck the DVD.

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:20.809
No, no, no, you are
a smart girl, okay?

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.520
Listen, bottom line--
just suck that cock.

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.685
Yep, that pretty much
sums it up.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.197
Okay '

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.073
Good job, all right, but we need
to go faster here, all right?

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.368
I don't have all day. Come on.
Are you going--

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.127
are you gonna get
that one down? Good.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.755
All right, guys, also, hey,
I asked for 10 guys

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.256
and they gave me six,
all right?

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:49.087
I think one of them is gay,
so five and a half.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.923
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:54.339
More budget cuts. Castro's knocking
down our break room.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:58.430
He says that it's an extra expense
the company can't afford any more.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:01.938
Oh, come on, girl, don't cry.
And they took our coffee machine.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:05.100
<i>-</i> They're taking away all the Slim-Fast.
- And now I'm gonna get fat.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:08.189
Get me some more of these
slag-hammer things.

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.776
And somebody bring me up
my "Maxim" magazine.

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.487
Hey, Castro, you can't do this.
You can't take our break room.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.448
( Crowd exclaims )

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.742
I think I just did.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.617
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:58.323
But that turned out to be--

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:01.865
Oh, now what is this?

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.875
What is this?

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.583
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:08.871
( laughing )

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.416
<i>-</i> Okay, yeah, that's great.
- The joke's over.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:15.007
Yeah, why don't you go--
why don't you go protest?

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.547
<i>-</i> Why don't you go out and have--?
- Kline: Not gonna happen.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.467
- Nice sign.
- There'll never be a union.

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:23.933
Why don't you get one of those
giant inflatable rats?

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.223
- Rats.
- You know? Right?

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.936
- Rodney: What do we want?
- Union.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.521
- When do we want it?
- Now.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.561
- What do we want?
- Union.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.651
- When do we want it?
- Now.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.281
- What do we want?
- Union.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.034
They're so any"!!-

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:40.035
We're standing here at Treadline
with Mike Murphy

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:42.492
where the secretaries have walked out.
Mike, what's going on?

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.828
You're witnessing something
beautiful here right now.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.493
What you're seeing
is people who have decided

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:47.751
they're not gonna take it any more.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.504
So we're just a bunch of girls out here
fighting for our rights.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.165
- When do we want it?
- Now.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:54.129
But you're a man.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:58.013
I'm a man? Well, on the outside,
that may be true,

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:01.516
but here on the inside, where it
counts, we're all the same.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.803
- Ken, Ken, Ken.
- Yeah, what?

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.687
- Ken.
- Yeah.

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:10.567
There are no more fucking donuts.
This is a nightmare.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:14.104
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Treadline shit has got to go.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.068
Hey, hey, ho, ho,

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.903
Treadline shit has got to go.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.695
Shame on Treadline.
Take that, Castro.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.705
Oh, that is uncalled for.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:27.868
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Treadline shit has got to go.

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.457
One of them just peed
on the company flag.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.463
Whoo!

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.717
Whoo! Yow!

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.262
- ( Alarm blaring )
- Oh, not the Z, not--!

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:48.312
You got me, Castro?
You got me?

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.940
Do you got me, Castro?

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.897
- I love it. Do you got me, Castro?
- Mike: I am tired...

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.903
-( laughing )
- ...of the sexual innuendos

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.064
- and dirty looks!
- Crowd: Yeah!

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.825
And what about the dirty
little nicknames they give us?

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.781
Boo!

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:05.493
Cupcake.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.282
Sugar tits!

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:10.122
( Crowd shouting )
No!

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.662
Whore!

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.085
Well-- well--

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.095
- well, not any more.
- No!

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:23.757
No, not on my watch.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.766
Yeah !

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.599
- Not on our watch.
- Yeah!

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.855
No, today--

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.936
today is a new day.

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.943
Today and every day

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.321
from now
until the end of time

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:41.608
will be known
as secretaries' day!

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:50.325
( Feed back whines )

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:55.709
Castro sucks, he's got no sack.
We all want our break room back.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.749
Castro sucks,
he's got no sack.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.758
We all want
our break room back.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.840
Castro sucks,
he's got no sack.

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:03.755
We all want
our break room back.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:07.801
Castro wants to talk.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.844
Oh, yeah? Can't Castro
come out here himself?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.434
He's a little scared

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:14.975
- of them.
- ( crowd laughs )

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:18.520
And, frankly, so am I.
That's why I brought backup.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:21.565
- And they're packing heat.
- They're packing mace.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.574
Hey, that shit'll burn your
eyes out, Murphy.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.076
Don't you forget it.
So back off.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.908
Take it easy, Dirty Harry.
Tell Castro we're coming in.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.572
Yeah.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.161
- ( laughter )
- I'm all right.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:32.701
Pussy!

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:35.620
( Cheering )

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:41.505
We all want
our break room back.

01:13:41.667 --> 01:13:44.045
Castro sucks, he's got no sack.
We all--

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:47.385
Kline: "The Art of War"
by Ken Castro. Mm-hmm.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.676
I wouldn't want to be
in their shoes right now.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.344
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.263
Mike-- always there to save
Rodney's neck.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.977
I don't even--

01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.190
- Men: Whoa!
- O'Donnell: Oh, my God.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.028
Castrate Castro.
Castrate Castro.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.908
Castrate Castro.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:08.536
Castrate--

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:23.093
We did it!
We got a union!

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.256
J' Break it up I

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.390
J' Break it up I

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.600
J' Don't go knocking
at my door J'

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:40.689
.l"And cry J'

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.782
J' Telling tales
of the broken... J'

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.193
Whoo!

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:50.111
Mr. Rodney McAdams,
get your can up here.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:52.575
<i>-</i> Up here now. Come on, Rodney.
- No, no, I don't sing. I don't sing.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.081
<i>-</i> Get up here. Get up here.
- No, no, no.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.117
- Hey, let's go.
- Come here. Get up here.

01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:57.500
I want you to know,

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.631
because you helped me get
this beautiful body,

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.133
now you gotta give me
some love.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.010
Whoo!

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:11.470
<i>-</i> Oh-ho-ho, no. No way, no.
- ( women cheering )

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.102
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Rodney, Rodney, Rodney.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:18.265
- Wearing the shot.
- All right.

01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.933
Come on, come on.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.726
Come on. Whoo!

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.769
(women cheering )

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.359
Betty:
Yes. Yes.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:41.458
We were just having a little fun.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.964
Oops.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:46.125
- It was just a little titty shot.
- Betty: I didn't even see her.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:51.344
My father saw you
on TV, Rodney.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:53.803
He saw you.

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:55.513
You're a secretary?

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.849
You told me that you got
a promotion.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:00.310
Yeah, well,
I meant demotion--

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:02.851
demotion, not promotion.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.066
I got caught up in the moment
at the party.

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:09.072
And after that weird talk
with your father, I just--

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.825
I panicked.
I just-- I panicked.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.486
I'm sorry.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:23.375
I just-- I thought I could fix it
before you found out.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:26.507
Guess what, Rodney--

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.721
you didn't fix it.

01:16:31.879 --> 01:16:34.382
I have never lied to you--

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.425
never.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.890
Never once have I lied to you.

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.021
I can't do this.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.433
I can't.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.001
I'm sorry, man.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:04.457
It's a bummer.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.877
It sucks.
I know. I've been there.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:13.087
No, you haven't.
You haven't been there.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.348
Yes, I have.

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.554
I've been there.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.093
You haven't
been there, Mike.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.933
You've never had a girlfriend
for more than six months.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:24.065
Oh, come on.
Dude, what about--

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:28.319
what about the chick from,
you know, Sweater Puppies?

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.151
- Katie Olsen?
- Katie. Katie Olsen.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.065
Like, she dumped me
senior year.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.075
Senior year?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.328
<i>-</i> What?
- My marriage just fucking fell apart

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.580
before it even started, and you're
talking about senior year?

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:42.287
- How's that even close?
- Well, I know how you're feeling.

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:45.669
That deep pit in your stomach,
how that feels--

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.330
I know how that feels.
See, you're feeling--

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.964
- I've been there.
- Stop, please.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.046
<i>-</i> Where are you going?
- Uh, I don't know.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.710
I'm gonna go try and find
a place to live,

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.845
because my fiancée--
well, actually, scratch that--

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.132
my ex-fiancée kicked me out
of the fucking house.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.104
( Pop music playing on radio )

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.940
( music stops )

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:21.118
<i>-</i> Hey, Castro.
- Hey.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.658
- Ken.
- Rodney.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.953
Oh, you're looking
really good there.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.497
Listen,

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:32.132
I really want my job back.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:34.009
<i>-</i> Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And Mike's, too.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.091
I mean, enough of this
demoted stuff, okay?

01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:38.221
We get it.
We totally get it, all right?

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.677
You win.
You're the boss.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.302
Look, I'll do anything
you want, okay?

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:46.313
I'll give you the commission
on all my sales.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:49.897
Rodney, you don't get it.

01:18:50.059 --> 01:18:52.608
There is no
getting back your job.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.148
In fact, in two weeks,

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.237
you're not even gonna have one.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.361
What are you talking about?

01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:02.905
Oh, yeah, because of
that little stunt you pulled--

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.747
secretaries' union-- I have to get back
in corporate's good graces.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:10.539
The easiest way to do that-- agree
to lay off some of the sales division.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:13.173
Boom! You and your little band
of secretaries--

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.505
first to go.
Bye-bye.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:27.104
Do you want to talk
about it?

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.357
He's gonna fire us, Jane--

01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.017
all of us.

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:33.402
Doesn't that just figure?

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:36.029
Castro screws up
and we lose our jobs.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:39.032
Yeah.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:43.955
This is every memo,
every note,

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:47.538
every email,
every letter and contract

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.453
pertaining to
the Reilly account.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.131
This was Farrell's baby.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:00.513
This is the biggest account
in the country.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.673
( Exhales )

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.386
Jane, you're taking a big risk.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:07.929
My girls are my life.

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:11.395
If this can help save
theirjobs, I'm in.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.030
( Ken whispers )
Oh, yeah.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.408
Oh, hello there.
What's your name?

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:22.910
Qh. yeah?

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:26.572
That's-- that's my name too.
( chuckles )

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.741
Ken Castro likes what he sees.

01:20:28.907 --> 01:20:32.628
- Ken, Ken.
- Oh, hey, hey. God damn it.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:34.914
Were you just looking
at a picture of yourself?

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.084
( Stuttering )

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.799
'Cause, yeah,
I'm scrapbooking for--

01:20:40.961 --> 01:20:42.884
taking an online
scrapbooking course.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:46.176
Well, listen, listen, I just got off the
phone with McPherson at Reilly Auto.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.891
It seems Murphy, McAdams
and our girl Jane

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.476
just went into a private meeting
with Mr. Reilly.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:53.140
- What the hell are they doing?
- I don't know.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:54.604
We've got to get over there.
Whoa.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.940
Get off me.
Get off.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.278
I'm fine.
Kline, thank you.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.823
Are broken-- stupid--

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:06.862
yeah, that's-- that's great.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.952
Now our earnings models also show
that our overall value

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.916
is expected to rise by the third quarter
of next year.

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:18.800
Which, of course, will lower costs
for our bigger suppliers.

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.129
I like the sound of that.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.636
Jane: You can see that
clearly graphed out

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.638
here and here.

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.470
Yeah, and with this
shaky economy,

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.601
having our affordable tires
on your shelves

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.434
not only is good for your customers,
but it's great for your business.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.439
Ken:
All right.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:35.975
( Tires screech )

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.360
- GO, 90, 9°, 9°, go'
- I'm going.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.738
It's that orange thing. Go.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:49.830
<i>-</i> Go.
- That's ridiculous.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:53.333
Hey, Ken, Ken, Ken,
don't forget to validate.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:55.415
Thank you.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.290
<i>-</i> I'm Ken Castro for Mr. Reilly.
- You can't go in there.

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:01.834
Mr. Reilly, don't listen
to a word they say.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.753
Kenny, I didn't think we had
a meeting scheduled for today.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.049
It's Ken, damn it.
My fucking name is Ken.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:12.812
Well, Ken, it seems that Treadline
tires will be in my stores after all,

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.597
thanks to your
coworkers here.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.141
They did a hell of a job
and, from what I understand,

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:19.685
may have saved a few jobs
in the process.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:23.197
What--? No, you didn't make
a deal with them.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.198
Yes, I did.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:28.236
But they're not--
you can't--

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:29.995
Ah, see, Kenny?

01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:32.202
We did what apparently
you couldn't.

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.037
We closed the deal.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:37.710
You know what, McAdams?

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:40.043
I've enjoyed torturing you.
I really have.

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.548
It's been fun.

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:45.382
But I think I'm gonna enjoy
kicking your ass a little bit more.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.388
Come on, McAdams.
Let's settle this right now. Come on.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.424
Mikey, you want to take
this one?

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:52.514
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.394
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead, take the first--

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:56.100
oh!

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:59.225
- Rodney: Ouch.
- Whew.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.564
A pretty solid punch for a secretary.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:04.480
- Yeah.
- I'm getting the coffee.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.159
Hey, what's going on in here?

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.545
Oh, hey.
I'm glad you're back.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:21.580
We could actually use a hand.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:24.170
<i>-</i> Who's this?
- This is Amy. Amy, meet Mike.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.212
- Hi, Mike.
- Wait, so this is how it works?

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:30.756
You fire me and then you bring in some
temp-agency trash to replace me?

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.301
- Wow.
- What are you talking about?

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:35.344
Look at her.
She's dressed like a hooker.

01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:38.640
Mike, Amy's my sister,

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:40.978
not a temp, okay?
The audit's over.

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:42.939
She was just helping me
pack my things.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.694
( Mouths )

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:45.979
Yeah.

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.240
- Yep.
- That's so great.

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.116
Let me hold that.
It looks heavy.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:53.574
There you go.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.865
Maybe sometime we could
grab a drink,

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.705
since you're not officially,
like, my boss any more.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.540
A drink sounds good.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.376
I heard Bennigan's makes
one hell of a margarita.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.257
What, are you kidding me?
Benny's the best in town.

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:07.088
Actually, I have my own table,

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:09.720
which is kind of cool, right?

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:12.552
Um, kind of.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.682
( laughs )

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:19.722
I'm sorry about calling you
temp-agency trash

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:22.141
and a hooker--
uncalled for.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.309
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:35.408
- Hi.
<i>-</i> Hi.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.494
Oh, these are for you.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.994
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.255
Okay, listen, Jennifer,

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.883
I don't even know
where to--

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.668
oh, guess what--

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:52.304
I got my old job back today,
maybe even a promotion.

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:54.681
Yeah, landed the biggest account
in the country.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.934
<i>-</i> Corporate had no choice.
- That's great, Rodney.

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.221
I'm happy for you

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.436
What, and that's it?

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:06.944
Oh, I didn't do it for me, Jennifer.
I did it for you.

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:08.979
I did it for us.

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:13.196
God, Rodney,
it was never about your job, okay?

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:16.988
Secretary, sales associate--
who cares? I don't care.

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:19.873
Well, your dad cared.
He made that very clear.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.832
But I wasn't engaged
to my dad.

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:26.292
He's not the one
who lied to me.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.378
That was you.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:30.918
You're right.
And I'm sorry.

01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:33.132
I am so sorry,
you have no idea.

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.674
I swear-- and I know
I've said this so many times,

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.513
but it will never, ever
happen again.

01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:39.972
- Just stop.
<i>-</i> No, no.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.012
- Just stop. It's fine.
- No, I'm not gonna stop.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.681
I've changed.
I'm a different guy now.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.975
- Just stop. Just stop.
- No, no, I don't want-- no, no.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.939
<i>-</i> It's fine.
- I'm not gonna stop. It's not fine.

01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:49.478
- I don't want to hear any more.
- I've changed. Listen,

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:51.022
I'm not gonna stop
until I get you <i>back,</i> okay?

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:52.906
- Just listen to me.
- No, no, I'm not gonna stop.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:55.284
- It's fine. Will you just listen to me?
- And remember we made a deal?

01:25:55.442 --> 01:25:57.570
Remember the promise I made?
Remember that?

01:25:57.736 --> 01:26:00.239
- I'm not gonna stop.
- Rodney, what--?

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.749
No, no, I'm not gonna stop
until I get you back.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.626
<i>-</i> Honey?
- Because, if you recall,

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.628
I made a promise.
Here it is.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:09.757
I made a promise. And I make good
on my promises, sweetheart.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:12.509
<i>-</i> Rodney, what are you doing?
- Let me tell you something: I love you.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.137
I love you so much.
And now the whole world's gonna know.

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:17.218
Jennifer Daniels, I love you.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.509
I love Jennifer Daniels!

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:22.144
- No.
- Hello, everybody. Hello, world.

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:24.851
I love Jennifer Daniels.
Aw, Ed, Lucy.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.643
Sweet little Lucy,
I love Jennifer Daniels.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.903
Oh, hello, Mr. Sisseck.
How are you today?

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.938
- Hey, Rodney.
- I love Jennifer Daniels.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:34.357
On you go, sweet spirit.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.402
Oh, Nancy, Tom, if you knew
how much I love Jennifer--

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.114
- Tom: Congratulations.
- If you knew-- I love her.

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:41.200
- Nancy: That's nice.
- I love her so much.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.866
I love Jennifer so--

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.251
(women laughing )

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.629
Olivia: Hi.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.290
<i>-</i> Are you kidding me?
- You don't need anything that big.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.379
- You guys enjoy the show?
- Whoo!

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.636
-( laughing )
- They were inside.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.296
They got here
about 15 minutes before you did.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.135
I tried to tell you.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:02.597
They told me everything. They told
me how much you've changed.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.512
They told me
how much you've helped them.

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.681
I'm so proud of you.

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:11.148
We thought you needed
a backup plan.

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:15.356
I gave her the same advice
you guys gave me.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.618
They love you.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.701
And so do I.
I love you.

01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:24.911
I love you, too.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.916
I love you.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.298
J' We need to find a way... J'

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:34.959
Could you cover my butt
with my shirt?

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.253
- I think Nancy's staring at it.
<i>-</i> Yeah, sure.

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.387
J' We need to find a way... J'

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:41.674
Please cover my ass.

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:46.387
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.100
<i>HEY</i>

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:09.709
Rodney.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:13.755
<i>-</i> Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:16.588
So you really got
the promotion this time, right?

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.718
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:28:20.212 --> 01:28:23.341
I promise, this time
I really got the promotion.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.384
( laughing )

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.848
( Rodney grunts )

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:35.273
<i>-</i> I'm proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:37.855
( Chuckles )

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.898
Excuse me.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.191
Hi, sweetheart.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:43.577
Jesus, he is an animal--
your father.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.954
Wow. Please hold me.

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:48.240
Jane: ...have you
in the Treadline family.

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:52.582
Mr. Casey, I think you're gonna be
very pleased with our product.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.710
Closed another one.

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:58.420
Oh. Oh.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.756
Man: It's gonna be hard
to keep up with you, Jane.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.970
- Hi, hi.
- Hey, coffee bitch.

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:09.181
<i>-</i> Oh, you know it. Sorry I'm late.
- What've you got?

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:11.938
The guy at the coffee place
is a real pain in the ass.

01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:15.601
As fast as I could. I don't know if he
gave me a sleeve. It's pretty hot.

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:18.604
Rodney:
Yes, absolutely.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.944
Mike and I plan on paying a personal
visit to every store we sell to.

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.109
Well, that's how we roll.

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:30.620
Yeah-- no, things have changed
quite a bit around here.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.085
No' no, no,

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:35.962
Mike and I are running
the sales department now.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:39.466
Hi, Rodney, did you get a chance
to look at these--?

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.503
<i>Yes.</i>

01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:45.673
Jesus titties fucking Christ.

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.716
Yeah, he was a douchebag.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:50.511
I could not agree
with you more.

01:29:50.677 --> 01:29:52.020
What's that?

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:54.180
No, we couldn't fire Kenny,

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:56.566
so we put him in charge
of advertising.

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.562
( Horns honking )

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:03.073
Hey, Treadline tires,
everybody.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.654
Give me a honk
if you like Treadline.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.034
Yeah.

01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:08.285
( Dog barking )

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:11.119
That's right.
Dogs love Treadline, too.

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:13.500
Treadline tires!
Yeah!

01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:18.839
Jesus. Jesus. Oh.

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:21.420
- Treadline tires.
- Boy: You're an idiot!

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:24.177
