WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:03.839
You can come for me if you want to.
But if you take me down,

00:03.920 --> 00:06.719
I'm going to take you down
twice as hard and twice as fast.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.399
You've got to make
a full statement, on the record, today.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.439
- I need a deal.
- That can't happen, Justin.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.439
I'm won't lose me job for anyone.
Not him, not you.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.639
So, I'll call you.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.879
And that makes you think
coming here is a good idea?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.319
No, but this does.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.559
DCI Luther has never,
to my knowledge, broken any laws,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.839
either in pursuit of his duty
or otherwise.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.479
I've been honoured to work with him.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.799
I don't want to play games.
You know, I'm too old for that.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.439
- I'm not a game-player.
- Good.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.759
'Cause neither am I.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.719
Ohh!

00:45.400 --> 00:46.999
Okay, ready?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:01.240 --> 01:03.159
Take care. All right, see you later.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.639
- See you later.
- Bye-bye!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.439
I was going to say, er,

01:08.520 --> 01:11.799
- do you want a lift?
- Uh, yeah. That would be lovely, yeah.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.999
Yeah, okay.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.479
Well, I'm just parked round here.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.799
- Okay, cool.
- Cool.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.079
Right.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.239
So...

01:32.720 --> 01:34.319
So...

01:47.600 --> 01:48.839
You took your time.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.319
I was just picking my moment.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.839
For three years?

01:55.400 --> 01:57.919
But, you know, this thing...

01:58.200 --> 01:59.319
me and you, it's not just...

02:02.160 --> 02:03.319
Get down!

02:06.720 --> 02:08.878
- Smash it in!
- We're gonna do you now!

02:10.160 --> 02:12.439
- Start the car.
- It's gonna be all right.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.559
- Come on!
- Get him out!

02:25.280 --> 02:27.199
Leave her alone!

02:43.400 --> 02:45.239
Get off me!

02:47.680 --> 02:49.559
What?

02:49.640 --> 02:51.799
Hey, boys!
Hey, boys, help me deal with this.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.919
Ah, nah, nah, stay there. Stay there.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.999
All right, pass me it.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.999
How can I help you?

03:04.080 --> 03:05.519
What is it, fam?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.319
You're looking for something, yeah?

03:07.400 --> 03:09.719
What? What are you, deaf?

03:11.080 --> 03:13.079
Hey, deal with him, man.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.359
Oh, he's fully loaded! Run! Run!

03:22.440 --> 03:23.599
- Go, go, go!
- Stop!

03:24.720 --> 03:26.079
Put your hoods down!

03:27.280 --> 03:29.359
Hoods down!

03:31.320 --> 03:33.759
Run, run, run! Let's go!

03:47.240 --> 03:48.759
Please, please.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.919
Please just wait, Callum.
Please, Callum.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.079
You've, um, still got love
in your voice.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.359
Well, you don't
stop loving someone, do you?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.799
Is that a problem?

05:16.280 --> 05:18.959
It's, um...
It's the opposite of a problem.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.919
- She was very beautiful.
- She was.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.919
Yeah.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.519
- Duty calls.
- Mmm.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.239
Justin! Come in.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.519
Sorry?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.159
Come in.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.519
Why?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.959
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, you never ask me in. Not ever.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.119
Mmm.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.679
Mary? Oh, sorry.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.199
Uh, this is my mate Justin.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.839
- Hey there.
- Hey.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.519
Justin, this is Mary.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.799
- All right, Mary?
- Hi.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.359
He's my mate. And I love him.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.519
Right. Work!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.039
You gonna be all right?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.439
- Fine.
- Yeah?

06:30.520 --> 06:31.959
- Fine, yeah.
- Make yourself at home.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.239
Will do. Totally.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.759
Well, come on, then, Justin.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.319
Nice to meet you, Mary.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.639
- Briefly.
- Yeah.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.519
All right, boss?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.839
Victims are Steven Meredith
and Shaun Butler.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.399
This is Meredith.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.839
Murdered a young solicitor
six years ago.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.239
It's in the file.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.679
- Eyewitnesses?
- Dozens.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.559
White male, 25 to 40.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.319
Lightish to darkish hair,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.559
short, possibly longish.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.079
Nondescript clothes.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.199
May ride a motorcycle.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.039
Possibly a scooter.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.399
Or a car.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.319
- Where's the other one?
- Over here.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.399
Shooter walks up during the affray,

07:49.480 --> 07:52.119
puts the sawn-off to Butler's chest.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.959
- Doesn't hesitate?
- Apparently not.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.399
It's not an easy thing, that.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.199
To put a sawn-off to someone's chest
and pull the trigger.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.119
Even if you hate 'em.
Let alone make this mess.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.599
- So who's Caitlin?
- Oh, we turned up no Caitlin

08:18.680 --> 08:20.599
in Meredith and Butler's ambit.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.839
No family or known associates.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.319
There's no Caitlin connection
to the solicitor.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.079
That rules out a revenge attack.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.559
And this is way too heavy
for a gang beef.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.558
- So what's up with the website?
- Goes live in two hours.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.239
Well, can't we just pull it down

08:37.320 --> 08:40.119
or trace it to the source
or whatever you do with websites?

08:40.200 --> 08:43.039
Apparently not.
It's being hosted from Uzbekistan.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.679
Or Kazakhstan.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.559
One of the Stans, anyway.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.639
The upshot is, is that there's no way
we can pull it down in time.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.319
Apparently there's hundreds
of these leaflets already in the wild.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.839
People have been tweeting
the address since about 5:00 a.m.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.519
So the chances of containing this,
essentially, are...

08:58.600 --> 09:00.279
three-eighths of sod all.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.239
Hello, Mary.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.079
Maxine, I'm DCI John Luther.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.679
You all right?

09:34.240 --> 09:36.799
This man, the killer.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.319
He spoke to you?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.999
- He did, yeah.
- What did he say?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.359
He, um...

09:53.200 --> 09:55.599
He told me not to be afraid.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.119
Do you remember anything
about his voice?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.119
- Maybe he had an accent?
- Um...

10:03.760 --> 10:05.079
Uh...

10:07.680 --> 10:08.959
It was nice.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.999
In what way?

10:11.760 --> 10:16.399
Kind. He, um...
he had a very kind voice.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.559
He had a kind voice?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.119
And then?

10:23.280 --> 10:24.479
He...

10:30.360 --> 10:32.679
He sat and he held Callum's hand

10:32.760 --> 10:35.319
until the ambulance arrived.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.799
Can you describe him?

10:40.720 --> 10:42.479
- I'm sorry?
- Describe him.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.079
The killer of these men.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.879
Why?

10:56.920 --> 10:58.439
Maxine, they're dead.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.199
Now, I know he seemed kind...

11:03.280 --> 11:04.999
- but that doesn't give him the right...
- What,

11:05.080 --> 11:06.599
give him the right
to save Callum's life?

11:06.680 --> 11:08.999
Stop me from being gang-raped?

11:09.080 --> 11:11.919
The way I see it, two people
were going to die last night.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.999
Thanks to this man,
and no thanks to the police, by the way,

11:15.080 --> 11:18.479
it wasn't me and it wasn't Callum.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.359
And now you're asking me
to help you send him to prison?

11:22.840 --> 11:25.919
I would rather go to prison myself.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.759
So how did you and John meet?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.519
Sorry, I'm just not very comfortable
having this conversation.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.079
How much do you actually know
about John Luther?

11:43.760 --> 11:45.159
Um...

11:45.680 --> 11:47.559
I'm not actually sure what that means.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.359
Look, why don't...
Why don't we just give him a ring?

11:50.440 --> 11:53.999
Put it this way. Try, if you like.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.599
Does he ever talk about her?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.959
Well, he doesn't not talk about her.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.879
Okay, um, I've actually got to go.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.599
Sit down.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.159
I'm late for work.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.999
Did John ever mention how she died?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.519
Um...

12:18.760 --> 12:22.119
I'm not actually sure that
that's any of your business.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.639
She left him.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.359
Shacked up with another man.
And not long after she was killed.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.719
- Did he mention that?
- I'm sorry.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.639
I'm not sure what's
supposed to be going on here, um...

12:36.720 --> 12:37.999
I'm completely lost.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.119
That's why we're here.
To help you understand

12:41.200 --> 12:43.399
how lost you really are.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.799
Oh...

13:06.840 --> 13:08.279
You all right?

13:08.360 --> 13:11.319
Yeah. Got it down to about 14 possibles.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.599
It's just weird
seeing all these terrible things

13:13.680 --> 13:15.439
happening to women with the same name.

13:15.720 --> 13:20.039
Caitlin raped. Caitlin stabbed.
Caitlin drowned. It just seems...

13:20.360 --> 13:21.799
I don't know.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.439
Justin...

13:24.120 --> 13:26.159
I think it's time you move on, mate.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.159
I mean, you should be doing my job,

13:31.240 --> 13:32.959
having little Ripleys of your own.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.559
Been meaning to tell you that for...

13:38.960 --> 13:40.639
You need to get to Hamlyn Woods.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.679
All right, guv.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.959
Couple of dog walkers
found him, apparently.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.119
- Do we know who he is?
- Yeah, Liam Glass.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.599
Why does that name sound familiar?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.919
For a few months he was
the tabloid's favourite bogeyman.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.999
Because?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.559
He lived in the spare room of the flat
where Lucinda King died.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.279
Ah! The little girl.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.159
Yeah, four years old.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.319
Mr Glass was her stepfather's cousin.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.919
Crack cocaine addict,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.079
arsonist, career burglar.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.319
He sat by and took no action
while her mother and stepfather

14:24.400 --> 14:26.359
- starved and beat her to death.
- Yeah, what did he get?

14:26.520 --> 14:27.599
Five years?

14:27.680 --> 14:29.039
Four, with time served.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.759
Four for four.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.359
Our boy's killing predators, isn't he?

14:37.440 --> 14:40.319
People the justice system spat out.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.719
He's on a mission.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.359
We'd better find him.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.239
And find him fast.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.759
It's going live now, boss.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.239
By now, many of you
will be wondering who Caitlin is.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.999
She was my wife.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.359
This is Caitlin.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.959
Four years ago...

15:20.560 --> 15:22.439
she was raped and murdered

15:23.240 --> 15:25.959
by a man called Milan Knizac.

15:26.040 --> 15:30.319
Mr Knizac had been classified
as "medium risk" by probation staff

15:30.400 --> 15:32.319
when he was released from prison

15:32.400 --> 15:35.799
less than halfway through
a nine-year sentence

15:36.040 --> 15:38.279
for robbery with violence.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.399
Caitlin wasn't just taken from me.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.039
She was taken from her friends.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.279
She was taken
from her mother and father.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.479
She was taken from the children

15:49.560 --> 15:51.399
she will never have.

15:54.840 --> 15:58.199
The criminal justice system
was created to protect us

15:58.280 --> 16:00.399
from people who would do us harm.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.639
But time and again,
it fails in that purpose.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.559
For all the Caitlins

16:09.720 --> 16:11.399
and for all their families,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.719
it's time for that failure to end.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.279
Okay.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.799
I think we've got a big problem.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.839
For all their families,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.679
it's time for that failure to end.

16:55.760 --> 16:56.959
Come on in.

16:59.880 --> 17:03.599
Tom Marwood. Architect.
Pretty good one, apparently.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.559
Caitlin dies, he's depressed.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.279
Spends a bit of time in hospital.
Then, all of a sudden, boom.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.479
He's energised.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.159
Joins a gun club,
takes lessons in Krav Maga,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.878
urban survival courses.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.679
It's like he's training
for the zombie apocalypse.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.079
Wow.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.919
So before this all kicked off,
who was he talking to?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.799
Who was his confidant?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.959
Uh, Alan Ramsey. Caitlin's brother.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.598
- This one?
- Yeah.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.159
Ramsey. All right, find him.
We've got to talk to him.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.759
Guv, Marwood's been planning this
for a long time.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.439
He's well prepared, he's off the grid

17:35.520 --> 17:36.799
and we're not gonna find him
where he's at.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.279
We've gotta find him
where he's gonna be next.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.879
And how are we gonna do that?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.999
Well, he's making a play
for public sympathy.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.679
Meaning he'll keep targeting
offenders that people hate the most.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.599
- The worst of the worst.
- So?

17:46.680 --> 17:48.039
So...

17:48.120 --> 17:51.959
say we find the ten
most debased scumbags in London,

17:52.040 --> 17:53.239
put a surveillance team on 'em,

17:53.320 --> 17:55.719
see if we can't get to Marwood
before he gets to them.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.959
Yeah, well, how do we
narrow down the possibles?

17:59.040 --> 18:02.119
I mean, depravity is
hardly in short supply in this city.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.479
We collate nature of offence
against the volume of press coverage.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.279
It can definitely be done, boss.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.359
All right. Let's do it.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.839
Hey. Can we meet?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.799
Yeah. You all right?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.359
Yep. I just... really need to talk.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.039
Okay. Seriously, are you all right?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.479
Some people came round
after you'd gone.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.239
What people?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.599
A man and a woman.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.799
Police.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.039
I can't talk about this
on the phone. I can't.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.519
- I need to see you.
- Mary, all right, listen.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.999
Just tell me where you are right now.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.719
- At work.
- At work?

19:02.800 --> 19:05.799
- All right, good. I'll just come now.
- No, no, don't do that.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.679
Mary?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.279
Hey.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.399
Should we get a cup of coffee
or something?

19:23.560 --> 19:25.119
Yeah. In a minute.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.719
- Um...
- You all right?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.039
Yeah, um...

19:30.760 --> 19:32.599
How did your wife die?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.679
Zoe?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.559
Uh, that's a long...

19:41.600 --> 19:42.879
It's a long story.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.119
She was, um...

19:49.800 --> 19:51.319
taken...

19:52.960 --> 19:55.719
by a friend of mine, someone I knew.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.959
And if I'd asked you that question
this morning...

20:02.000 --> 20:03.959
before that...

20:04.040 --> 20:06.799
Glaswegian dick
had done his dirty business,

20:06.880 --> 20:08.639
would you have given me
the same answer?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.079
- Of course.
- Why?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.919
Because it's the truth.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.759
Hey, listen.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.719
- Whatever they said, they were lying.
- They had a file on you.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.799
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I did nothing.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.959
Whatever they told you,
they were lying.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.319
I... I think you should
stay away from me.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.759
- Mary! Come on.
- Please!

20:49.680 --> 20:51.279
Mary!

20:54.120 --> 20:55.719
They were lying!

21:03.320 --> 21:04.759
Justin. What?

21:04.840 --> 21:07.199
We're down to 263 potentials.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.919
Well, you'd better move faster
than that, then, eh?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.639
We'll get there. Where will you be?

21:10.720 --> 21:13.199
Oh, I'll be checking out
the brother-in-law.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.479
Okay.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.719
- Hello.
- George.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.359
John Luther!

21:26.440 --> 21:28.399
How the devil are you?

21:28.480 --> 21:31.399
I'm fair to middling.
Have you got two minutes for me?

21:32.320 --> 21:34.079
I'll put the kettle on.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.799
What?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.839
What are you scared of, Erin?

22:04.320 --> 22:08.359
I'm scared of what
this is turning into.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.639
- So?
- So here's the thing.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.079
You come for me, I'm fine with that.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.359
I'll match you bite for bite

23:23.440 --> 23:26.279
and, in the end,
we'll see who's still standing, right?

23:27.240 --> 23:30.439
But you need to keep away from Mary.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.999
She's off limits.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.839
But what's the point
of knowing your weak spot...

23:38.520 --> 23:40.559
if I don't get a chance to...

23:41.720 --> 23:42.759
poke it a bit?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.679
See, here's the thing, John.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.519
This isn't some pre-match symposium.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.759
There are no rules of play.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.439
- George, if you sow these seeds...
- Then what?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.919
I reap the whirlwind?

24:00.840 --> 24:01.959
Is that right?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.759
You know your problem?

24:06.120 --> 24:08.999
You've spent your life
thinking you're the whirlwind.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.879
Well, you're not.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.279
Because I'm the whirlwind, John.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.679
I'm the whirlwind.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.439
We'll see.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.599
A big police search
is underway in London,

25:21.680 --> 25:24.119
trying to find vigilante suspect
Tom Marwood,

25:24.200 --> 25:25.999
after he posted an online video...

25:32.200 --> 25:33.559
Who is it?

25:33.640 --> 25:35.439
It's Lee from downstairs.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.439
Um, courier dropped
something off for you.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.959
I signed for it.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.839
What is it?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.479
Uh, it's... I don't know,
a book or something?

25:53.680 --> 25:54.679
Please.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.759
Hello?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.199
Alan Ramsey?

26:19.880 --> 26:22.279
- Speaking.
- It's DCI John Luther.

26:24.280 --> 26:26.239
This'll be about Tom, I take it?

26:26.320 --> 26:28.919
Yes, it is. Do you have
a couple of minutes to spare for me?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.399
Sure.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.199
I'll see you there.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.599
Alan Ramsey?

26:57.040 --> 26:59.479
Alan? DCI John Luther.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.599
Don't move!

27:14.760 --> 27:16.039
All right.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.599
Stop, stop, stop!

27:45.680 --> 27:46.919
Stop!

27:50.320 --> 27:51.839
Do me a favour.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.999
And throw me
your phone and wallet, please.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.279
One out of five murders

28:12.640 --> 28:14.879
are committed by men on bail.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.999
- You know that?
- Every copper knows that.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.079
Then why does nobody
do anything about it?

28:20.160 --> 28:22.239
Because it's complicated.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.599
No, it's not.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.159
No, it's not.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.839
You've got me there.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.319
Listen...

28:35.560 --> 28:38.279
Detective Chief Inspector John Luther.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.479
All I want is what you want.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.719
To have these people locked up
so they can't do any more harm

28:43.920 --> 28:45.279
to anyone else.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.199
Now, look me in the eye
and tell me you disagree with that.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.519
Not the motive, maybe.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.679
But I seriously dispute the means.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.319
What, you've never been tempted?

28:59.040 --> 29:01.399
To administer
a bit of personal justice?

29:03.440 --> 29:05.679
I don't have the right to do that.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.559
Nobody does.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.159
Two days.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.799
Give me two days. That's all I need.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.999
- For what?
- To make things better.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.199
- You know I can't do that, Tom.
- Yes, you can.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.439
If you chose to.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.479
Tom...

29:31.200 --> 29:33.719
you know they're going to kill you.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.999
This is how all these things end.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.879
I died the day I came home
and found my wife's corpse

29:43.320 --> 29:45.359
stuffed into the airing cupboard.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.119
Don't make me your enemy, John.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.919
We're on the same side.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.799
I'm sorry you think that.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.439
Tom, listen to me.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.879
Tom!

30:12.720 --> 30:14.239
Um, DCI Luther?

30:20.520 --> 30:23.559
- He's not here, ma'am.
- Oh, okay.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.839
Then, um, I wonder if you
could spare me a minute, DS Ripley?

30:38.880 --> 30:40.079
Thank you.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.879
So what is this,
like a Derren Brown thing?

30:52.960 --> 30:54.799
- Who?
- Mindreader. Mentalist. Reads minds.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.639
Oh, right.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.679
No, you don't
want to read my mind right now.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.279
Full of scorpions.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.519
Right.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.199
He's long gone.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.439
I didn't know he'd be here.
Swear to God.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.599
I didn't call him or anything.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.039
He cloned your SIM.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.679
He's a clever boy, your brother-in-law.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.039
I'm beginning to like him.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.559
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.279
Yeah, I think so.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.919
Justin, I think
I might have taken a wrong turn

31:35.000 --> 31:36.839
- somewhere along the way.
- Surely not.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.439
Well, that wasn't exactly
the disarmingly gallant reaction

31:41.520 --> 31:42.719
I was hoping for

31:43.080 --> 31:46.759
- in my heart of hearts.
- What were you hoping for?

31:46.840 --> 31:49.759
In your heart of hearts?

31:57.280 --> 31:58.519
DS Ripley.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.159
Boss.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.439
Yeah, on my way.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.199
Got to go.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.839
- And fight the good fight?
- Listen, we'll... we'll put it right

32:09.920 --> 32:12.119
- but I really do need to go.
- Sure.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.839
Do you want to talk
about this properly?

32:20.240 --> 32:21.719
That's why I'm here.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.559
No, I mean... properly.

32:23.960 --> 32:25.759
As actual human beings.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.159
- Like a drink or something?
- Oh...

32:30.960 --> 32:35.079
- Okay.
- All right, well, I'll give you a bell.

32:35.160 --> 32:36.479
Okay.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.519
- This got my numbers on it?
- All six of them, yeah.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.039
Who needs more
than six numbers? Marwood?

32:52.240 --> 32:54.039
Had it on his toes. Long gone.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.839
So, I had a visitor. Erin Gray.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.759
Oh, yeah? She had problems
parking her broomstick?

32:59.960 --> 33:01.439
She wasn't a happy flower.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.759
- This about Stark?
- I think so.

33:04.640 --> 33:08.119
- I get the impression...
- He's not playing with a straight bat?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.879
Yeah. I get that impression, too.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.199
Why, what's happened?

33:13.920 --> 33:15.359
Nothing.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.479
Listen, I've got to go. Cover for me!

33:20.400 --> 33:22.559
You have one saved message.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.799
wow, you were right
by your phone. So, anyway,

33:27.120 --> 33:28.959
it's me. Hi.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.599
That's Mary.
Mary Day from last night?

33:32.680 --> 33:35.719
So, yeah, anyway, cool.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.639
Speak soon!

34:03.640 --> 34:07.199
I know, I know you said
to leave you alone, don't talk to you

34:07.280 --> 34:08.839
and I will, I'll just...

34:09.000 --> 34:10.998
I just wanted to say one thing.
And then I'm gone.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.199
Say it.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.958
I'm really sorry
that you saw what you saw.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.719
I can only imagine
how it made you feel.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.958
It made me want to throw up
is how it made me feel.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.839
It made me want to...

34:22.000 --> 34:23.079
vomit.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.159
- I didn't do those things.
- So,

34:25.239 --> 34:27.799
why did they say that you did?
Was it for a laugh?

34:27.880 --> 34:30.199
Look, I'm not gonna say
I haven't done stupid things,

34:30.280 --> 34:32.079
I have. I've done stupid things.

34:32.159 --> 34:35.399
Really stupid...
But I was trying to help people.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.399
And I... You know, it just got...

34:39.159 --> 34:41.079
It's kind of like
when your car goes into a skid.

34:41.159 --> 34:42.359
And they tell you, you know...

34:42.440 --> 34:46.399
Turn into the skid and then
you'll find yourself coasting.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.639
Trying to hang on
and hoping that somehow

34:50.719 --> 34:52.639
you'll straighten out before you...

34:54.760 --> 34:56.799
get to the edge. I...

35:01.760 --> 35:05.119
None of what they said was true.
None of it.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.719
So you need to tell me what is.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.359
I don't know if that's a good idea.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.479
Oh, well, how am I supposed to
trust you if you don't trust me?

35:16.760 --> 35:18.919
I need to know, John.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.559
Okay.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.119
All of it?

35:26.800 --> 35:29.079
All of it.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.079
Every last drop.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.559
I've got to take this. I'm sorry.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.999
I've got to take...

35:44.440 --> 35:45.639
Yeah.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.159
- Boss?
- Good news.

35:51.240 --> 35:54.759
The proactive strategy
seems to be working, in principle.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.519
In principle? Wow.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.679
A sex offender, Terence Corran,
was abducted from his flat

36:01.760 --> 36:03.559
a little more than two hours ago.
He's on the list

36:03.640 --> 36:06.319
- but we were too late.
- Oh, I had him, I had him!

36:07.440 --> 36:09.599
I had my hands on him.
I just let him go.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.799
Well, he had a gun to your head

36:10.880 --> 36:12.839
so I think it's more a case
of him letting you go.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.279
All right, look, just have Benny
send me the, um...

36:16.560 --> 36:17.919
address.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.759
All right.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.879
- I'm having a horrible day.
- It's okay.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.559
But, um...

36:32.920 --> 36:35.759
I'm gonna be back late tonight.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.439
But later than usual, I mean.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.039
I will be back.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.879
You know where everything is.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.839
Yeah, I think so.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.879
- I'll be there.
- All right.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.159
You all right?

37:44.280 --> 37:45.879
Corran's a paedophile.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.639
Did 15 years
for false imprisonment and rape.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.599
Bit of a tabloid nightmare.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.279
Went on to self-publish
poems and essays

37:53.360 --> 37:55.399
about inter-generational love.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.559
Sees himself as a champion of freedom.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.519
Ungoverned by religion or law.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.599
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.639
Lack of conscience
dressed up as philosophy.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.919
- It's not right, is it?
- What's not?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.119
Well, Marwood
walks up to Butler and Meredith...

38:17.200 --> 38:18.359
Blam.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.799
Doesn't do the same with Corran.
Why is that?

38:23.560 --> 38:25.319
You find any keys?

38:25.480 --> 38:27.559
Not that I'm aware of, no. Why?

38:28.080 --> 38:29.799
That's what you do, you know?
You walk in,

38:29.880 --> 38:32.919
big bag of books in one hand,

38:33.240 --> 38:35.039
plop 'em down,

38:35.920 --> 38:37.599
put your keys on the table,

38:38.160 --> 38:39.839
fish out your wallet and your phone.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.079
Yeah, okay.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.799
So who took his keys and why?

39:08.080 --> 39:10.439
- My name is Terence Corran.
- Boss!

39:10.520 --> 39:12.119
I'm a paedophile.

39:12.400 --> 39:17.039
I spent 15 years in prison for
the heinous violation of young children.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.199
I've shown no contrition

39:19.280 --> 39:23.439
because I don't believe sex between
adults and children to be wrong.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.439
Statistics suggest that,
having been released,

39:28.200 --> 39:30.999
I'll go on to commit
many further offences

39:31.360 --> 39:33.559
against many other children.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.959
But still,
the criminal justice system set me free.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.319
So what should be done with me?

40:16.320 --> 40:17.959
No...

40:37.960 --> 40:41.319
- Do you understand social networking?
- No.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.919
Good. Then I'm not alone.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.119
Apparently, people are climbing
over each other

40:48.200 --> 40:50.319
to incite Terence Corran's execution.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.079
Bread and circuses.
Nothing new under the sun.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.399
If Tom Marwood gets his wish, and people
vote to hang the paedophile -

40:57.480 --> 41:00.919
and they will, for who would
suffer a paedophile to live? -

41:01.000 --> 41:02.999
...then there's no telling
where this is going to end.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.799
Riots, copycat murders,

41:06.520 --> 41:08.359
lynchings, pogroms.

41:08.440 --> 41:12.199
Gangs of vigilantes kicking to death
people whose faces don't fit.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.959
Where's your head at?

41:19.520 --> 41:21.999
Well, we're not gonna find
Tom Marwood before midnight.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.479
But if you're right,

41:23.560 --> 41:26.799
if he executes Corran
this all gets very ugly very quickly.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.159
But we know
he's monitoring the media.

41:30.240 --> 41:33.999
And you're right. There's nothing more
potent than private pain made public.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.439
Please.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.119
Upstairs has signed off.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.439
Having made it perfectly clear that,
if this goes lopsided,

42:11.520 --> 42:14.239
it's you and me
who will swing from the gibbet.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.119
It won't go lopsided.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.319
Benny?

42:24.400 --> 42:28.439
If this goes lopsided I need you
to find every bit of intel on Corran.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.159
Haunts, associates, anything
that makes your nose twitch, all right?

42:31.240 --> 42:33.279
- Come on.
- Go, Blue Leader.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.799
- Cheers, Ben.
- Cheers, Justin. Look after yourself.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.559
- Excuse me, mate, Kiera Mills?
- Over there.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.119
Kiera?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.479
Kiera Mills?

43:00.800 --> 43:02.559
Do you know what that man did to me?

43:03.560 --> 43:04.919
Terence Corran?

43:07.400 --> 43:09.399
I say "man".

43:09.960 --> 43:11.279
Do you know what he did?

43:13.960 --> 43:15.119
Yes.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.399
I was a little girl. I was 11.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.399
- And he...
- Kiera, I should explain to you

43:30.480 --> 43:33.799
that I have no sympathy
for Terence Corran.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.599
All right? Not one bit.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.719
And I don't get to choose who
should live and who should die.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.799
Even if I hate them myself.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.799
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to ask someone to do.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.559
What do you want?

43:57.960 --> 44:00.519
I want you to plead
for Terence Corran's life.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.039
- Benny Boy?
- So I've been trawling the list

44:18.120 --> 44:20.199
of Corran's known associates.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.319
Nothing solid.

44:22.640 --> 44:26.319
But about a month back,
a parole officer got a tip-off

44:26.560 --> 44:28.879
that a nonce, a Gordon Murray,

44:28.960 --> 44:32.999
was in breach of his parole,
associating with known sex-offenders.

44:33.080 --> 44:36.759
Corran's not been named but him
and Murray were known to be BFFs.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.719
Right, and where do we find Murray?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.879
All right, Gordon?

44:57.200 --> 44:58.639
We're the filth.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.119
Which is funny, really,
considering who we're talking to.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.799
Shall we try that again?

45:08.880 --> 45:10.639
I'll have a lemonade, please.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.159
What do you want?

45:35.160 --> 45:37.679
They say Marwood
could be unpredictable and dangerous.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.439
Everyone wants him dead.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.679
Your mate, Terence Corran.
King Nonce.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.399
He's got less than an hour.

45:46.560 --> 45:48.279
- I think you know where he is.
- How could I?

45:48.360 --> 45:49.839
I think Marwood's been following you.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.799
I think he's taken Terence
back to your... clubhouse,

45:52.880 --> 45:56.839
where you and your dirty little mates
have your social gatherings.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.599
So where is it? Back of someone's pub?
Dirty little shop somewhere?

46:02.720 --> 46:03.959
- Come on.
- No, you've got it wrong, mate.

46:04.040 --> 46:06.159
I'm not your mate.
I'm far from your mate.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.439
The sight of you makes me
want to wash my skin with Domestos.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.559
The terms of my parole
forbid me from using the internet

46:11.640 --> 46:13.799
or mixing with other sex offenders.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.599
- Is that right?
- Boss...

46:18.200 --> 46:19.359
Can you turn that up, please, love?

46:19.480 --> 46:21.599
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

46:22.520 --> 46:27.159
I know you're all aware
of how urgent this situation is.

46:27.440 --> 46:31.319
So Kiera will now make
a short statement.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.519
My name is Kiera Mills.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.079
You don't know me,
because I was never named in the press.

46:43.040 --> 46:46.479
But 18 years ago,
when I was a little girl,

46:46.600 --> 46:49.599
Terence Corran stole me
from the back of my mum's car.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.279
She'd just popped to the shops
to get some milk.

46:52.880 --> 46:57.159
Terence Corran kidnapped me
and raped me.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.999
He ruined my life.

47:08.240 --> 47:11.519
This morning, a man
kidnapped Terence Corran

47:11.600 --> 47:15.519
and threatened to kill him
for all the terrible things he has done.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.159
Not just to me
but to other little boys and girls.

47:26.440 --> 47:28.719
So I have come here today...

47:30.680 --> 47:36.719
to send a message to the man
who has Terence Corran in his keeping.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.399
And that message...

47:46.440 --> 47:48.399
That message is kill him!

47:58.960 --> 48:00.879
Right, you tell me where he is

48:00.960 --> 48:03.079
or when they come for you,
I'll let you just hang.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.679
- Don't look at me, mate.
- Come on!

48:04.880 --> 48:07.719
- All right! There's a lock-up.
- A lock-up? Where is it?

48:07.800 --> 48:09.999
We use it for meeting, socialising...

48:10.080 --> 48:12.839
- You disgust me! Come on.
- If I tell you,

48:13.200 --> 48:15.359
you might find some materials.

48:15.440 --> 48:18.039
- Shut up, shut up! Where is it?
- None of it's mine!

48:18.120 --> 48:21.799
- Where is it? Tell me now!
- I want it in writing.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.919
Horsemonger Lane, the railway arches.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.959
You just... All you do
is cross the estate.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.359
Benny. Corran's got a lock-up.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.839
Railway arches, Horsemonger Lane.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.639
Scramble ARV now.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.839
Don't! Don't! Please.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.159
Please, no!

49:06.840 --> 49:09.239
Please just let me go.

49:17.840 --> 49:20.199
Please, no!

49:21.400 --> 49:24.119
Oh, God. Oh, God!

49:29.520 --> 49:31.079
Shh, shh, shh.

49:41.040 --> 49:44.239
CO19 are en route. ETA 13 minutes.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.239
Local units should be there in nine.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.599
Wait, boys, he's tweeting the address!

49:49.040 --> 49:51.279
We're on our way.
We'll be there in two, three minutes.

50:08.960 --> 50:10.239
Watch out!

50:25.000 --> 50:26.559
Move, move, move!

51:02.720 --> 51:04.279
Stop right now!

51:05.560 --> 51:07.839
Thomas Marwood! Enough!

51:16.200 --> 51:17.559
Move!

51:28.600 --> 51:29.959
Come on, move!

51:32.120 --> 51:33.359
Come on!

51:44.240 --> 51:46.279
Let go! Let go!

51:54.040 --> 51:56.519
- Get back, get back!
- Get Marwood!

51:57.080 --> 51:58.599
Get him off!

52:40.800 --> 52:42.719
He's still alive. Grab them!

53:07.040 --> 53:08.519
Tom Marwood! Stop!

53:15.720 --> 53:17.519
Okay, enough.

53:21.920 --> 53:24.359
We're done, Tom. All right?

53:25.600 --> 53:27.599
- What's your name?
- DS Ripley.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.399
- Justin.
- What I need you to do, Justin,

53:32.720 --> 53:34.439
I need you to back away.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.399
I can't do it.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.399
Of course you can.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.679
No, I can't. Sorry.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.079
You've already done enough tonight.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.359
I saw how you waded into that mob.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.399
That was brave.
Nobody could ask any more of you.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.159
So just...

53:55.440 --> 53:56.679
back off.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.519
Let me go.

54:02.080 --> 54:03.519
Let's say I did that,

54:04.440 --> 54:05.959
yeah, and all this carries on.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.839
Someone innocent gets hurt.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.879
- How am I supposed to live with that?
- It won't happen.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.479
It'll happen.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.559
You've made your point, Tom.
People are talking.

54:17.640 --> 54:20.559
You're all over the internet.
All over TV.

54:21.720 --> 54:24.999
- You've done what you needed to do.
- I don't want to do this.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.719
I'm a copper.

54:35.400 --> 54:36.999
We're on the same side.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.919
I don't think you're going to shoot me.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.079
Now, please.

54:45.040 --> 54:47.719
- Just back off.
- I'd love to.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.919
Please!

54:52.720 --> 54:53.759
No.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.399
Justin! Justin!
