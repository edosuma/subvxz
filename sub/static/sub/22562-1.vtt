02:34.964 --> 02:36.950
What are you doing?

02:37.911 --> 02:40.534
I'm bloodying up these two-headed

02:40.536 --> 02:43.578
babies to go into the incubator room.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.372
It's one of the rooms that the

02:45.374 --> 02:47.553
actors really enjoy working in.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.186
It's a long process trying to find

02:53.188 --> 02:57.641
different recipes for
different sorts of blood,

02:57.643 --> 03:01.996
whether you want it to be flat, dried blood

03:01.998 --> 03:05.071
or whether you want it to
keep looking really glossy

03:05.073 --> 03:07.185
even when it's dry,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.813
and one that's going to stay on...

03:09.815 --> 03:13.752
even in the rain, especially
outside in the forest.

03:13.754 --> 03:17.115
It's been a fair bit of
experimentation though,

03:17.117 --> 03:19.517
into trying to find some blood recipes.

03:19.519 --> 03:21.568
And what's the winning formula?

03:21.570 --> 03:27.461
The winning formula is Resene
Furniture Gel mixed with...

03:28.873 --> 03:32.906
This is really a secret,
should I be telling you this?

03:34.126 --> 03:35.889
Hello, Spookers, Beth speaking.

03:36.977 --> 03:40.180
The Haunted House, The
Freaky Forest and Disturbia.

03:41.814 --> 03:43.253
They're all open, it just looks like

03:43.255 --> 03:45.144
we might have a little
bit of light drizzle,

03:45.146 --> 03:48.059
so probably if you do
The Freaky Forest first

03:48.061 --> 03:49.692
and then if it rains you know that

03:49.694 --> 03:51.199
you're not going to miss out.

03:58.758 --> 04:00.230
Yeah, absolutely.

04:00.232 --> 04:04.875
We've had... I think the oldest
person was 98, so 63 is fine.

04:04.877 --> 04:07.662
Yeah, just make sure she doesn't
wear high heels or anything

04:07.664 --> 04:09.394
so that she'll be comfortable.

04:14.839 --> 04:19.416
I had pizza for breakfast, at about 1pm.

04:19.418 --> 04:22.879
So, very unbalanced diet.

04:23.905 --> 04:26.628
But I guess it's 'cause of work last night.

04:49.979 --> 04:51.481
I work in a supermarket and

04:51.483 --> 04:54.301
I study bio-med and I work here.

04:54.303 --> 04:57.054
The beauty of working at
Spookers is that you can...

04:57.056 --> 04:58.785
be whoever the hell you want to be.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.290
You can be whatever you want.

05:00.292 --> 05:02.374
Express yourself, like, look
at me, I'm in a wedding dress.

05:02.376 --> 05:05.032
I would never wear this
to count down, obviously.

05:05.034 --> 05:10.412
But, yeah, tonight I'm
a zombie bride and, hey,

05:10.414 --> 05:12.110
can you be a zombie bride at your work?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.682
Yeah...

05:15.252 --> 05:17.074
Oh, I'm a dessert chef.

05:17.076 --> 05:22.361
So, I make, like, panna cottas, crème
brûlées, pavlovas and meringues.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.981
I do a nice chocolate pudding
with, like, hokey pokey

05:25.983 --> 05:28.159
and a nice caramel sauce with it.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.090
Beautiful.

05:34.503 --> 05:36.551
What are you afraid of in real life?

05:36.553 --> 05:38.794
I'm afraid of commitment.

05:38.796 --> 05:39.788
Of my mum.

05:47.219 --> 05:50.422
I've been with Spookers
for nearly three years.

05:50.424 --> 05:52.984
It's something that I've
wanted to do for years

05:52.986 --> 05:56.602
but never quite had the confidence to...

05:56.604 --> 05:58.656
do an audition and things like that.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.506
'Cause I was always quite shy.

06:02.371 --> 06:04.001
But not so shy anymore.

06:07.079 --> 06:14.445
For the last 11 years
I've done insurance claims

06:14.447 --> 06:19.377
and in insurance you really
have to be nice to people and

06:19.379 --> 06:21.909
regardless of whether they
say you're wrong or not,

06:21.911 --> 06:25.880
you still have to sort of be professional.

06:25.882 --> 06:30.398
Whereas over here you're
paid to scare people.

06:32.770 --> 06:36.227
I'm on a bit of a holiday from...

06:36.229 --> 06:40.742
any kind of corporate employment,

06:40.744 --> 06:45.005
mainly because I'm over it.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.200
When I originally auditioned here

06:49.202 --> 06:50.674
I thought I would never get through.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.171
I just convinced myself...
I was like, you know,

06:53.173 --> 06:54.646
they're not going to call me back.

06:54.648 --> 06:58.392
And I remember when I got the
call I was at school in assembly

06:58.394 --> 06:59.929
and I saw my phone ringing and I was

06:59.931 --> 07:01.629
like, no, got to get out of here.

07:01.631 --> 07:02.844
And I, like, ran out of the hall,

07:02.846 --> 07:04.414
answered the phone and Julia's like,

07:04.416 --> 07:08.738
"You've got the job." And I just
started crying, I was so happy.

07:08.740 --> 07:11.397
I was obsessed with this
place before I worked here.

07:11.399 --> 07:14.122
I think I had been here, like, 24 times.

07:18.702 --> 07:21.519
And what's it like
being a flight attendant?

07:21.521 --> 07:23.441
Flight attendant is just like any

07:23.443 --> 07:25.652
job, you have your bad days, good days.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.631
Everything that happened that
was bad in the week, you know,

07:28.633 --> 07:30.744
I just suck it up and then I come

07:30.746 --> 07:33.308
here and I let it all out in character.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.521
(INAUDIBLE)

07:37.473 --> 07:41.028
Coming from school and then coming here,

07:41.030 --> 07:43.399
it's just like...

07:44.553 --> 07:46.921
You know, just get into character

07:46.923 --> 07:49.454
and scare people, which is fun.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.439
I like it.

07:52.273 --> 07:54.833
I'm not very social outside of work,

07:54.835 --> 07:56.306
I just usually stick to myself.

07:56.308 --> 08:00.342
But here you're always
meeting new people, new faces.

08:00.344 --> 08:02.171
Everyone just gets along.

08:03.195 --> 08:05.306
When I first started working

08:05.308 --> 08:08.029
here I didn't know how to act.

08:08.031 --> 08:10.400
I didn't know characters.

08:10.402 --> 08:14.150
And I was kind of scared of clowns.

08:17.066 --> 08:18.956
But now that I work here,

08:21.006 --> 08:22.286
I've become one.

08:27.955 --> 08:29.138
Alright, guys,

08:29.140 --> 08:30.740
customers are told they
are not allowed to smoke,

08:30.742 --> 08:32.150
drink or eat inside the attraction.

08:32.153 --> 08:34.265
Also, no photos or videos.

08:34.267 --> 08:35.322
If they get a bit too scared, they're

08:35.323 --> 08:36.443
told to put their hand up and say,

08:36.445 --> 08:38.780
"Stop." If they do that, back off.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.158
If they ask you to take them out, take

08:40.159 --> 08:42.753
them out the quickest way possible.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.547
Don't touch any of the wobbly bits,

08:44.549 --> 08:46.148
back of the necks, top of the head.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.782
Shoulders and back of the legs is fine,

08:47.784 --> 08:50.088
stay away from the fronts of the body.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.081
Anything else?

08:51.083 --> 08:51.948
Yeah!

08:52.493 --> 08:55.309
Whoo-hoo!

09:05.625 --> 09:07.259
Whoo-hoo!

09:11.007 --> 09:13.086
Occasionally when people come to Spookers

09:13.088 --> 09:15.841
they'll get scared in the car park or

09:15.843 --> 09:18.757
scared just outside the front doors

09:18.759 --> 09:21.639
and they never even get
in to buy their tickets...

09:21.641 --> 09:23.978
they'll hop in their cars and leave.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.451
When that first happened we had to

09:25.453 --> 09:26.861
have a talk to some of the staff

09:26.863 --> 09:30.192
because we were losing too
many people out of the car park.

09:30.194 --> 09:34.231
So the actors generally work
closer to the ticket office now.

09:40.316 --> 09:43.581
It's tough but I'd have
to say probably death.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.816
Yeah, like, everyone else is
afraid of dying, so, yeah...

10:04.949 --> 10:07.829
(INAUDIBLE)

10:55.367 --> 10:57.738
You all little corpses (INAUDIBLE).

12:49.273 --> 12:52.955
When I first found the site
I had no idea what it was.

12:52.957 --> 12:54.910
I had heard of the Kingseat
Psychiatric Hospital

12:54.912 --> 12:57.024
but that didn't even come into my mind.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.137
And I was driving past, saw the sign...

12:59.139 --> 13:01.474
And as soon as we saw
this building we said...

13:01.476 --> 13:02.404
Yeah, as soon as we saw this

13:02.406 --> 13:03.975
building, this is just perfect.

13:03.977 --> 13:06.504
We actually had to find somewhere that

13:06.506 --> 13:09.547
was a huge building, had some land,

13:09.549 --> 13:11.598
for the maze and, you know,

13:11.600 --> 13:13.488
a forest, and it was perfect.

13:13.490 --> 13:14.833
It had some atmosphere.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.198
Yeah. So, you don't want
to give it up too easily.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.990
Excuse me.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.917
Do you think this place
gives you weird dreams?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.120
What do you think it's like on your brain,

13:47.122 --> 13:49.682
having these sort of double
lives and scaring people

13:49.684 --> 13:53.463
and then being normal
at your normal job and...

13:53.465 --> 13:55.608
I reckon it could be
unhealthy, to be honest.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.779
Like, you could, like,
persuade yourself that you're,

13:58.781 --> 14:01.248
like, a character that isn't real.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.304
I don't know.

14:02.306 --> 14:04.483
Like, I've never thought about that before.

14:04.485 --> 14:10.058
I reckon that is pretty, like, unhealthy
but then actors do it, like, in movies.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.409
Honestly, I have a lot of nightmares.

14:19.411 --> 14:22.741
I have quite a problem with nightmares.

14:22.743 --> 14:26.392
And I can't even really remember...

14:26.394 --> 14:28.634
I remember them when I
wake up in the morning,

14:28.636 --> 14:29.978
but then I forget.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.573
But, yeah, I certainly have
more nightmares than dreams.

14:33.697 --> 14:35.171
Good afternoon, Spookers.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.126
Hi.

14:53.043 --> 14:54.163
Can you remember

14:54.165 --> 14:56.055
your dreams last night or this morning?

14:56.057 --> 14:57.752
- My dreams?
- Yeah.

14:57.754 --> 14:59.706
Oh, those are fun.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.470
I have lots of those.

15:55.762 --> 15:57.301
Life's hard.

15:58.550 --> 15:59.384
It is.

15:59.864 --> 16:00.697
Why?

16:01.850 --> 16:05.660
I don't know, stress, people.

16:05.662 --> 16:07.549
You've got to like people.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.602
Then you've got to dislike people.

16:10.785 --> 16:14.053
The struggles, the struggles of life.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.039
Yeah.

16:17.192 --> 16:19.689
But then you have people like Bubbles,

16:19.691 --> 16:23.151
and Puppy and Bunny...

16:24.144 --> 16:26.031
make life all better.

16:26.033 --> 16:28.181
Oh, it's OK.

16:29.045 --> 16:30.871
Bubbles and Puppy are here for you.

16:57.905 --> 17:00.756
About 1990 I got really sick

17:01.878 --> 17:04.888
and it turned out that I
had an auto-immune disease.

17:06.329 --> 17:09.948
But that took a long time to diagnose

17:09.950 --> 17:13.567
and I was quite ill for a long time.

17:13.569 --> 17:17.923
And we had a business at the
time, which we had to sell

17:17.925 --> 17:20.741
because we couldn't manage to run it.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.888
But we went on to do other things.

17:22.891 --> 17:26.378
If I hadn't had that time,
we wouldn't have had Spookers.

17:26.381 --> 17:32.850
At that stage we were growing
around 200, 300 ha of maize

17:32.852 --> 17:38.264
and I saw a little wee
sentence in a newsletter

17:38.266 --> 17:40.409
that I was reading on the internet that

17:40.411 --> 17:42.557
said, "Have you seen the maize maze?"

17:42.559 --> 17:44.381
And as soon as I saw that sentence,

17:44.383 --> 17:47.843
everything just became
absolutely crystal clear.

17:52.937 --> 17:55.401
We started with a day
maze and then one night

17:55.403 --> 17:56.970
we got a whole lot of our friends

17:56.972 --> 17:59.757
into the maze in the evening

17:59.759 --> 18:01.486
and we thought we'd try it.

18:01.488 --> 18:03.857
So it just sort of developed and, you

18:03.859 --> 18:05.779
know, we just used the local farmers

18:05.781 --> 18:10.712
and they're all mates and they'd jump
off their tractors and just arrive

18:10.714 --> 18:11.994
and they'd grab their chainsaws...

18:11.996 --> 18:14.075
- And bank managers.
- Yeah, and the local cop.

18:14.077 --> 18:15.935
Two bank managers and the local policeman.

18:15.937 --> 18:20.323
Yeah. And we'd just run around like idiots.

18:20.325 --> 18:21.798
It was so much fun.

18:28.652 --> 18:31.116
We turned the wool shed
into a haunted house

18:31.118 --> 18:34.480
for Halloween one year
for kids and families.

18:34.482 --> 18:36.307
We thought it'd be fun.

18:36.309 --> 18:42.936
And then it got so busy in the
wool shed that we kept it open

18:42.938 --> 18:44.701
while Corn Evil was open

18:45.756 --> 18:48.958
and it ended up that
Andy used to have to truck

18:48.960 --> 18:51.425
the sheep away to somebody else's farm

18:51.427 --> 18:54.051
to get them shorn because our wool shed

18:54.053 --> 18:56.168
was always a haunted house.

19:00.717 --> 19:02.444
We started looking for somewhere

19:02.446 --> 19:04.590
in Auckland to do a haunted house

19:04.592 --> 19:06.960
permanently and have
it open all year round,

19:06.962 --> 19:09.970
because with Corn Evil we could only do it,

19:09.972 --> 19:13.206
January till the end of April,

19:13.208 --> 19:15.800
and that's when the
maize all gets harvested.

19:15.802 --> 19:17.050
Yeah.

19:17.052 --> 19:21.216
We found this building
and it all just started.

19:31.724 --> 19:33.931
Like, you know, before when
it was a mental hospital,

19:33.933 --> 19:36.397
I mean, there was mental patients in there,

19:36.399 --> 19:39.440
did they, like, kick them
all out just to make this?

19:39.442 --> 19:41.748
Or did they all die or something?

19:41.750 --> 19:43.157
I doubt they all died.

19:43.159 --> 19:44.758
Well, how did they...

19:44.760 --> 19:45.816
They've could have transferred

19:45.818 --> 19:47.802
them to another mental institute.

19:47.804 --> 19:49.178
OK.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.907
What do you think of them

19:50.909 --> 19:52.511
turning it into a place like Spookers?

19:52.513 --> 19:53.822
I think it's a really smart idea.

19:53.824 --> 19:54.912
- Yeah.
- Really smart.

19:54.914 --> 19:55.969
Because there's already, like,

19:55.971 --> 19:56.769
those, not rumours

19:56.771 --> 19:57.859
but there's already like that sort

19:57.861 --> 19:59.236
of rumour thing going about, like,

19:59.238 --> 20:00.936
oh, yeah, it's haunted sort of thing.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.087
But, like, to have the experience

20:02.089 --> 20:03.048
of actually going in there

20:03.050 --> 20:04.170
and being scared by, like,

20:04.172 --> 20:06.412
everyday people, you kind of get...

20:06.414 --> 20:07.981
You think it is haunted.

20:07.983 --> 20:09.358
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.961
Like, for all we know it could be.

20:10.963 --> 20:11.922
But, like, for the people who are like,

20:11.924 --> 20:13.139
it's not haunted, sort of thing,

20:13.141 --> 20:15.189
they're still getting that, like,

20:15.191 --> 20:18.936
still getting scared by it, sort of thing.

20:18.938 --> 20:19.704
Yeah.

20:19.706 --> 20:21.499
I think it's a really smart idea.

20:21.501 --> 20:22.749
- Yeah.
- That was the basis.

20:22.751 --> 20:24.382
Whoever came up with the idea, well done.

20:24.384 --> 20:28.485
- Genius.
- Well done.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.717
We, you know, we did really
have to hum and ha of,

20:40.719 --> 20:42.544
you know, should we be here

20:42.546 --> 20:45.010
when we knew, you know, obviously

20:45.012 --> 20:46.197
we found out very quickly it

20:46.199 --> 20:47.668
was the old psychiatric hospital,

20:47.670 --> 20:51.000
and we really did think
long and hard about it.

20:51.002 --> 20:52.440
Whether it was appropriate.

20:52.442 --> 20:55.227
Yeah and I think you'll
find a lot of the nurses

20:55.229 --> 20:56.926
and things that used to be here,

20:56.928 --> 21:00.770
they actually just like that
something is being done with the site

21:00.772 --> 21:02.212
and that, you know, there's areas

21:02.214 --> 21:03.910
of it that are being looked after.

21:03.912 --> 21:08.329
And people are happy to come to
work here and things like that.

21:08.331 --> 21:09.454
Yeah.

21:14.386 --> 21:20.310
I'm an incubator, so the character
kind of is a nurse who has, like,

21:20.312 --> 21:23.192
babies in incubators, which is a bit crazy.

21:23.194 --> 21:24.217
So, that's what I'm trying to go

21:24.219 --> 21:26.174
for... like, the crazy nurse thing.

21:27.263 --> 21:28.670
Do you know much about the nurses

21:28.672 --> 21:29.982
that used to live here?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.073
No.

21:31.075 --> 21:32.289
I'd like to though.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.442
It's an interesting subject.

21:33.444 --> 21:34.598
Creepy.

21:40.364 --> 21:42.415
I used to live in that room just up there.

21:43.567 --> 21:48.787
It had its own little
access down to a bathroom.

21:48.789 --> 21:50.358
It was pretty cool.

21:52.791 --> 21:55.674
I was really pleased that it was being

21:55.676 --> 21:57.788
put to some decent use, you know.

21:57.790 --> 21:59.677
And I thought it was sort of appropriate

21:59.679 --> 22:02.912
that they'd picked sort of a remote

22:02.914 --> 22:07.077
place that had sort of
some history like that.

22:07.079 --> 22:11.720
But in other ways, we're trying
to de-stigmatise mental health

22:11.722 --> 22:16.881
and here they are sticking
up these homicidal killers...

22:18.098 --> 22:21.077
...in an old mental health
institution. You know.

22:38.951 --> 22:40.613
Can you let me out?

22:40.615 --> 22:41.927
And what was the character

22:41.929 --> 22:43.787
that you were playing in the jail cell?

22:44.684 --> 22:47.533
Just like a crazy person who

22:47.535 --> 22:49.070
got locked up there for eating their,

22:49.072 --> 22:52.563
like, friend and killing
them and stuff. Yeah.

22:55.158 --> 22:57.273
You know, I just didn't want to be there.

22:59.258 --> 23:02.267
I like doing it, that's for sure, but,

23:02.269 --> 23:03.837
it kind of scares me knowing that people...

23:03.839 --> 23:05.566
Like, the old people that used to

23:05.568 --> 23:06.816
be here, part of the hospital,

23:06.818 --> 23:09.827
would act like that and
it's like making fun of them.

23:09.829 --> 23:11.493
But, you know, if they were

23:11.495 --> 23:14.024
actually here, as ghosts, ghosts,

23:14.026 --> 23:17.805
then they'd probably be like,
"Why is she acting crazy?" Yeah.

23:28.216 --> 23:30.584
It's interesting to have a maze,

23:30.586 --> 23:32.028
a physical maze here.

23:33.147 --> 23:36.575
With madness, what madness
takes from you is your essence

23:36.577 --> 23:39.136
and you're always trying
to find your way back.

23:39.138 --> 23:42.246
And it is like a maze.

23:43.430 --> 23:45.319
So that's pertinent I
suppose, in some ways,

23:45.321 --> 23:46.795
that they're going to put one here.

23:48.044 --> 23:51.661
There was so much distress
and so much misery here,

23:51.663 --> 23:55.121
and brutality in lots of
ways that people experienced.

23:55.123 --> 23:58.643
To see them mocked in any way is upsetting.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.430
And that's upsetting for me to think

24:01.432 --> 24:03.672
that they would be mocked in any way.

24:03.674 --> 24:05.693
And also that idea that...

24:07.006 --> 24:11.072
...people who were here
were violent and dangerous,

24:11.074 --> 24:13.890
which couldn't be further from the truth,

24:13.892 --> 24:16.293
sort of fitting into that stereotype

24:16.295 --> 24:18.024
that people who experience any sort

24:18.026 --> 24:19.624
of mental illness or any sort of mental

24:19.626 --> 24:22.123
distress are fundamentally dangerous.

24:47.910 --> 24:49.190
What have you got there?

24:49.192 --> 24:52.492
A straitjacket that I ordered from America.

25:02.166 --> 25:05.077
Things grow like death down here.

25:05.079 --> 25:07.193
So, what character are you playing?

25:07.195 --> 25:11.324
Basically it's just a psychopath that's...

25:11.326 --> 25:16.004
...slightly childish but smart.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.563
Educated kind of psycho.

25:18.565 --> 25:21.511
Then when I came back here
they locked me into this.

25:21.513 --> 25:24.552
But one of my arms is free now.

25:26.253 --> 25:28.557
Sometimes if I'm sitting
there the straitjacket

25:28.559 --> 25:30.512
I start thinking about it

25:30.514 --> 25:33.077
...just what happened and
if I'm being disrespectful.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.697
Because some of it was pretty bad.

25:37.817 --> 25:39.675
- In the hospital?
- Yeah.

25:59.951 --> 26:03.696
Hearing voices has never
actually been a problem.

26:03.698 --> 26:06.390
It's the impact that the voices had on me.

26:07.799 --> 26:11.704
My parents became concerned
with my behaviour as such

26:11.706 --> 26:14.812
because I was very confused about things.

26:14.814 --> 26:16.893
I would disappear,

26:16.895 --> 26:18.816
they wouldn't know where I was

26:18.818 --> 26:20.836
and I couldn't remember what I'd done.

26:21.795 --> 26:25.031
I was sent to a doctor
in Auckland Hospital.

26:25.033 --> 26:28.009
He was a psychiatrist, he told my parents

26:28.011 --> 26:29.738
that he believed

26:29.740 --> 26:31.757
that I should be committed.

26:31.759 --> 26:35.376
And my parents used to
come and see me regularly.

26:35.378 --> 26:37.843
After being here for a while

26:37.845 --> 26:40.247
they were told their visits upset me.

26:41.113 --> 26:42.295
And in that day, when the doctor

26:42.297 --> 26:44.153
said something, then that was it.

26:44.155 --> 26:45.979
So they stopped coming to see me

26:45.981 --> 26:48.063
and I never saw them for 18 years.

27:26.981 --> 27:28.710
There's people who run

27:28.712 --> 27:31.241
big businesses and,

27:31.243 --> 27:33.322
to be honest, I think some of them

27:33.324 --> 27:36.397
should have a psychiatric assessment.

27:36.399 --> 27:40.529
They've got no compassion
or anything like that.

27:40.531 --> 27:41.906
And then there's people who are

27:41.908 --> 27:44.598
full of compassion and, you know,

27:45.589 --> 27:47.737
have got a more eccentric view

27:47.739 --> 27:49.690
and they're less tolerated than those

27:49.692 --> 27:52.957
people who bully and badger people and

27:52.959 --> 27:55.713
they're who cause people like that to

27:55.715 --> 27:57.698
have mental health issues, you know.

27:57.700 --> 27:58.949
You know what I mean?

28:30.277 --> 28:35.080
Dyslexia, it's a learning disability so,

28:35.082 --> 28:36.489
learning is a bit harder.

28:36.491 --> 28:38.539
But also having ADHD with it as well,

28:38.541 --> 28:39.884
is annoying because I've got to

28:39.886 --> 28:41.550
take medication to make me...

28:41.552 --> 28:47.444
concentrate on my work,
otherwise I'd be looking round and

28:47.446 --> 28:51.290
doing texting or reading
stuff on the internet.

28:53.469 --> 28:55.452
My only problem was that it wasn't

28:55.454 --> 28:56.958
really pointed out or anything

28:56.960 --> 28:58.302
when I was younger.

28:58.304 --> 29:02.725
All the teachers just thought
that I was just a bad kid.

29:14.449 --> 29:19.030
I did get bullied about having
dyslexia and all that a lot.

29:20.503 --> 29:22.073
I get called stupid a lot.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.756
But then working here has helped me to

29:26.909 --> 29:29.408
get past being quiet and shy

29:30.562 --> 29:34.502
now, so it's kind of like
it's reversing all the damage.

30:11.946 --> 30:14.956
What does a mayor actually do?

30:14.958 --> 30:19.184
So, mayors are responsible
for running local government,

30:19.186 --> 30:21.138
providing roads and drains and

30:21.140 --> 30:24.245
all of those sorts of boring things

30:24.247 --> 30:29.755
and somehow managing to fit
that into a local economy

30:29.757 --> 30:31.581
that can sustain the rate increases,

30:31.583 --> 30:32.865
all those sorts of things.

30:33.986 --> 30:36.384
So you chair a lot of meetings and

30:36.386 --> 30:37.762
basically every night of the week

30:37.764 --> 30:39.558
I'm out at a meeting somewhere.

30:47.598 --> 30:51.155
I've never watched a horror
movie, ever, in my life.

30:52.402 --> 30:58.009
So I have to rely on other
people to tell me what happens.

31:02.878 --> 31:06.174
Andy and I sat down
one weekend and thought,

31:06.176 --> 31:07.905
'We need to watch horror movies,

31:07.907 --> 31:09.505
this is the business that we're in.'

31:09.507 --> 31:11.109
And we went to the video shop...

31:11.111 --> 31:13.225
that's when there were still videos...

31:14.858 --> 31:18.859
and we got, I think it was seven for $10,

31:18.861 --> 31:20.012
and we sat down and thought,

31:20.014 --> 31:21.807
'We're going to watch these things.'

31:21.809 --> 31:24.530
And we got about 10
minutes into the first one,

31:24.532 --> 31:26.066
looked at each other and thought,

31:26.068 --> 31:27.925
'No, this is not us.'

31:27.927 --> 31:29.305
And we took them back.

31:35.231 --> 31:37.601
I actually don't like being scared.

31:40.930 --> 31:43.461
And do you believe in ghosts?

31:43.463 --> 31:44.232
Yeah.

31:45.256 --> 31:47.208
At our home there's somebody that

31:47.210 --> 31:48.969
stands at the end of the bed

31:48.971 --> 31:50.381
in one of the rooms.

31:51.599 --> 31:54.514
And here at Spookers I've seen somebody.

32:02.361 --> 32:05.338
The scariest thing, and it is supernatural,

32:05.340 --> 32:09.918
is my mother ended up getting possessed.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.410
And it wasn't something
that lasted 24 hours,

32:13.412 --> 32:14.723
it lasted a long time

32:14.725 --> 32:17.512
and it was really, really scary.

32:24.398 --> 32:26.640
When it first started and I called the

32:26.642 --> 32:29.683
ambulance and one of the paramedics

32:29.685 --> 32:31.317
turned around and said to me,

32:31.319 --> 32:33.911
"There's nothing we can do to help her."

32:33.913 --> 32:36.504
And then he asked me if we
went to church and he goes,

32:36.506 --> 32:38.493
"Call your priest."

32:43.810 --> 32:47.397
She was trying to bite everybody except me.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.253
I didn't get kicked, I didn't get

32:49.255 --> 32:51.880
bitten, didn't get scratched,

32:51.882 --> 32:53.196
but everyone else did.

32:55.054 --> 32:57.968
I was three months
pregnant when that happened.

33:01.235 --> 33:05.494
The next night when I
found her with a lava-lava

33:05.496 --> 33:11.869
tied around her neck real
tight and that was really weird

33:11.871 --> 33:15.071
because I'd gone to the bathroom
and I could hear a funny noise

33:15.073 --> 33:16.323
coming from the room.

33:17.637 --> 33:19.908
So I quickly finished up
and went in there and I said,

33:19.910 --> 33:20.935
"Mum, are you OK?"

33:21.897 --> 33:24.171
And she was just making
this gurgling sound.

33:26.765 --> 33:28.176
Sorry.

33:33.108 --> 33:36.214
We had to hold her down and stuff

33:36.216 --> 33:40.217
to restrain her from
doing any further harm.

33:40.219 --> 33:45.278
Just seeing her deteriorate in
front of your eyes so quickly

33:45.280 --> 33:50.982
and there not being a real
reason behind it was also scary.

33:54.473 --> 33:57.513
I do try to incorporate some of that

33:57.515 --> 34:00.559
stuff that I've seen into what I do.

34:02.065 --> 34:05.010
People might think that,
you know, it's just a story.

34:05.012 --> 34:07.287
It's not a story.

34:09.143 --> 34:11.513
My family had to live through that and

34:11.514 --> 34:13.976
it was terrifying to see somebody

34:13.978 --> 34:17.245
go through that, that you really love,

34:17.246 --> 34:19.583
and the repercussions of what happened

34:19.585 --> 34:21.985
afterwards with her health and stuff,

34:21.987 --> 34:23.844
it was just, it was horrible.

34:23.847 --> 34:28.556
It was really horrible and I
wouldn't wish it on anybody.

34:56.197 --> 34:57.863
There are probably 10 or 20

34:57.865 --> 34:59.431
a night that don't actually make it

34:59.433 --> 35:00.044
through the attractions.

35:01.388 --> 35:04.203
We have customers that curl
up into the foetal position.

35:04.205 --> 35:07.151
We have customers that...

35:07.153 --> 35:09.490
just run away screaming,

35:09.492 --> 35:11.892
go and hide in their
cars and don't come back.

35:11.894 --> 35:15.511
We obviously have a lot of
customers that wet their pants.

35:15.513 --> 35:21.790
Some that do more than just wet
their pants, which is unfortunate.

35:21.792 --> 35:23.520
They don't make it through the attractions

35:23.522 --> 35:25.250
because they are scared.

35:25.252 --> 35:28.103
Basically we've done our
jobs really, really well.

35:30.730 --> 35:34.988
The most frightened customer I have seen is

35:34.990 --> 35:39.760
a woman cowering in the
foetal position in Corn Evil

35:39.762 --> 35:42.194
just sobbing her heart out.

35:42.196 --> 35:46.231
She was so scared that we
couldn't actually even move her.

35:46.233 --> 35:49.372
It took quite some time to
get her out of the attraction.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.375
How many coats have you got on?

36:34.377 --> 36:35.947
You've got two coats on.

36:44.755 --> 36:45.906
Yeah, yeah. So, tonight

36:45.908 --> 36:49.013
we're doing '13
F-Ed-up Fairy Tales'.

36:49.015 --> 36:49.946
Cool, eh?

36:53.661 --> 36:57.407
The actors get to decide which
characters they're going to be,

36:57.409 --> 36:58.401
within reason.

37:02.277 --> 37:06.887
If they are placed inside a
set that is, say, for clowns,

37:06.889 --> 37:09.066
then they are going to be a clown.

37:09.068 --> 37:12.141
But they do have creative
control over that character

37:12.143 --> 37:14.288
and what it really does look like.

37:20.022 --> 37:22.198
I'm hillbilly along with Claudia tonight.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.728
We're going to do a double act.

37:24.730 --> 37:26.459
Me and David's hillbillies.

37:26.461 --> 37:29.118
We're hillbilly princesses.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.234
We're going to look hot tonight so, yeah...

37:32.643 --> 37:35.492
Do you wear dresses in
your real life as well

37:35.494 --> 37:36.612
or only when you're at Spookers?

37:36.614 --> 37:39.591
I never wear dresses in my real life.

37:39.593 --> 37:41.001
Like, I think I'm, like, the only guy

37:41.003 --> 37:42.475
that wears dresses all the time.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.134
I don't really care 'cause
it's fun and, I know,

37:45.136 --> 37:46.446
if you're going to go
hard at it, it's because,

37:46.448 --> 37:48.882
why not wear a dress if you're a guy?

37:48.884 --> 37:50.354
But, yeah, no, I definitely wouldn't

37:50.356 --> 37:51.987
wear dresses in my real life

37:51.989 --> 37:53.110
but as our character here it's because

37:53.112 --> 37:55.675
I think it's awesome wearing dresses.

38:11.882 --> 38:13.898
The biggest stepping stone

38:13.900 --> 38:17.167
for me was finishing high school.

38:18.576 --> 38:21.361
I actually ran away from home,

38:21.363 --> 38:24.565
and I went out and got a job at McDonald's.

38:24.567 --> 38:28.697
And I was, yeah, I'd just
finished high school that year.

38:28.699 --> 38:34.334
A lot of it was more of
moving around so much.

38:34.336 --> 38:37.057
I mean, look, I could sit all night

38:37.059 --> 38:38.914
and talk about where I've lived

38:38.916 --> 38:40.069
and where I've stayed.

38:40.071 --> 38:44.424
But, yeah, that's
definitely been a journey.

38:58.073 --> 39:01.337
If I had had another son,

39:01.339 --> 39:03.580
he would've been my other son for real

39:03.582 --> 39:08.737
because I don't look at him
any differently from my own.

39:08.739 --> 39:10.722
He's been calling me mum since not

39:10.724 --> 39:12.580
long after he started working

39:12.582 --> 39:16.299
and we've just always got on.

39:24.147 --> 39:26.101
I love him so much.

39:26.774 --> 39:28.791
I love him like he's my own.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.360
It was on Halloween two years ago,

39:39.362 --> 39:41.057
whoever wanted to volunteer

39:41.059 --> 39:42.499
to donate blood.

39:42.501 --> 39:45.734
I've never donated blood, ever,

39:45.736 --> 39:47.080
so I thought,

39:47.082 --> 39:50.570
'Oh, I'll go along and
donate blood as well.'

39:50.572 --> 39:55.471
And we all got ready at
Spookers, early morning...

39:55.473 --> 40:00.245
it was just like a normal
day... and donated blood.

40:00.247 --> 40:01.720
Everything was cool.

40:24.558 --> 40:27.986
My phone was going off
quite a lot over the weekend.

40:29.652 --> 40:32.247
There was a person from the blood lab.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.888
The doctor told me to sit down in this room

40:36.890 --> 40:42.209
and my blood results said come
back and I had HIV positive.

40:51.689 --> 40:54.763
I was at work on the day
that he found out the news.

40:54.765 --> 40:59.984
And I got this phone call saying
that he needed to talk to me.

40:59.986 --> 41:03.254
I got outside and he was just devastated.

41:05.687 --> 41:07.385
It broke my heart because...

41:08.506 --> 41:11.483
just seeing the type of person that he is

41:11.485 --> 41:15.042
and then for him to get that bad news,

41:17.924 --> 41:19.718
your heart just breaks.

42:33.904 --> 42:35.379
My fear was dying.

42:37.172 --> 42:39.671
And how others would react to it.

42:41.400 --> 42:45.048
My own mum and dad and
my brothers and sisters,

42:45.050 --> 42:48.478
I was... They had to find out through

42:48.480 --> 42:50.145
social media, I didn't tell them.

42:51.522 --> 42:56.772
It actually took a month and
a half after I was diagnosed

42:56.774 --> 42:59.976
that my own father came and found me.

42:59.978 --> 43:03.437
And the state that I was
in, it wasn't a good state.

43:05.584 --> 43:06.930
Yeah.

43:09.619 --> 43:11.030
We all supported him.

43:11.830 --> 43:13.558
Yeah, it didn't change anything.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.511
Just treated him the same way we would.

43:15.513 --> 43:16.570
You know.

43:17.564 --> 43:18.845
So, yeah...

43:24.899 --> 43:26.500
It doesn't change him as a person.

43:27.556 --> 43:30.536
He's still the exact same
person we met, you know,

43:31.786 --> 43:33.259
when he first started working there.

43:35.438 --> 43:36.688
So, yeah...

44:05.515 --> 44:08.043
Get away from my baby!

44:08.045 --> 44:10.928
My hands! My hands!

44:31.589 --> 44:33.316
Chainsaw!

44:47.574 --> 44:49.304
OK, go again.

44:56.639 --> 45:00.384
Copy, (INAUDIBLE), thank
you. I'll get it done now.

45:00.386 --> 45:03.267
Oh, so, what's happened
is we've had some customer

45:03.269 --> 45:07.723
who's got a really bad fright
and crapped their pants.

45:22.200 --> 45:26.650
People certainly have a
fascination with fear and, you know,

45:26.652 --> 45:30.207
sometimes people will
be absolutely terrified

45:30.209 --> 45:32.704
and in the extreme they might
wet themselves and so on.

45:34.628 --> 45:38.149
And you think, 'Why are
these people doing this?'

45:38.151 --> 45:40.553
And maybe it's testing themselves,

45:40.555 --> 45:43.245
maybe it's peer pressure often as well.

45:44.463 --> 45:47.055
But ultimately they're there to have fun

45:47.057 --> 45:50.513
and we train the actors so that
they understand the boundaries

45:50.515 --> 45:52.949
of when it's moved beyond fun.

45:52.951 --> 45:56.088
So sometimes we have to Shh
for some customers because

45:56.090 --> 45:59.549
you know they're right
on their personal limits.

46:01.023 --> 46:03.968
It's so sad when that happens and, I mean,

46:03.970 --> 46:07.970
we try really hard to look after
them because, you know, I mean,

46:07.972 --> 46:10.566
if they are traumatised, that actually,

46:10.568 --> 46:14.185
it's real, it's absolutely real.

46:14.187 --> 46:17.132
And it's so important that we keep

46:17.134 --> 46:18.991
all the actors away from them

46:18.993 --> 46:21.937
and make sure that they feel safe.

46:21.939 --> 46:25.461
We had one girl who came back and she said,

46:25.463 --> 46:28.536
"I was so sure I could do it this time,

46:28.538 --> 46:30.747
this is the fifth time."

46:30.749 --> 46:32.830
And I've talked to myself and I've told

46:32.832 --> 46:34.975
myself that it was all just make-believe

46:34.977 --> 46:37.989
and everything was going
to be OK. But it's not."

46:39.430 --> 46:42.438
So I don't know if she's going
to come back for a sixth try.

46:42.440 --> 46:45.164
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:53.772 --> 48:54.859
And why do you think people

48:54.861 --> 48:56.877
want to go to this maze to get scared?

48:56.879 --> 48:58.925
That's why they come... to get scared.

48:58.927 --> 49:02.130
I have no idea. I don't know.

49:02.132 --> 49:03.828
I've never understood horror.

49:03.830 --> 49:05.716
I've never understood horror stories,

49:05.718 --> 49:09.081
probably because I've spent the
bulk of my life being so anxious

49:09.083 --> 49:10.297
and living in fear.

49:10.299 --> 49:13.758
The idea of doing that
purposely to yourself...

49:13.760 --> 49:15.617
which essentially is what I did...

49:16.962 --> 49:20.901
it doesn't sit with me or
resonate with me at all.

49:20.903 --> 49:22.953
I've got no understanding of that.

49:24.139 --> 49:27.595
I get my thrills from
doing very ordinary things

49:27.597 --> 49:30.384
because ordinary things
are extraordinary for me.

49:31.570 --> 49:35.858
Going out, being able to get
in the car and drive somewhere,

49:35.860 --> 49:36.820
that's extraordinary.

49:36.822 --> 49:37.941
For someone who's been incarcerated

49:37.943 --> 49:39.895
for 18 years, that's extraordinary.

49:39.897 --> 49:41.562
Being able to get up when you want to,

49:41.564 --> 49:43.195
admittedly I have to go to work

49:43.197 --> 49:46.368
and do things like that...
but I get to drive there.

49:49.827 --> 49:51.843
And what do you do now?

49:51.845 --> 49:53.445
I work at the university

49:53.447 --> 49:55.017
but I also work clinically,

49:56.170 --> 49:59.278
working with people
who hear voices as well.

50:01.776 --> 50:03.953
I got married and I had children,

50:03.955 --> 50:08.116
I did all those supposedly
very ordinary things.

50:08.118 --> 50:10.838
All of those things are a source

50:10.840 --> 50:12.792
of amazement and wonderment to me.

50:12.794 --> 50:15.162
They give me a huge thrill.

50:15.164 --> 50:16.861
I don't need to come to mazes,

50:16.863 --> 50:20.899
I spent over 20 years of
my life living in a maze.

50:26.536 --> 50:33.455
VOICEOVER FROM ELECTRIC CITY BY MUSIC

50:50.047 --> 50:51.005
Already many of the

50:51.007 --> 50:53.120
mutants disguised as human beings

50:53.122 --> 50:55.270
are walking the streets of earth's cities.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.200
Come buy a sausage.

51:00.202 --> 51:01.866
(INAUDIBLE)

51:01.868 --> 51:03.115
Only two dollars.

51:03.117 --> 51:08.339
Only two dollars. Come buy a sausage.

51:09.972 --> 51:12.885
♪ Sausages are beautiful. ♪

51:12.887 --> 51:15.960
♪ Sausages are beautiful. ♪

51:15.962 --> 51:18.715
♪ Sausages are beautiful. ♪

51:18.717 --> 51:21.758
♪ Especially with bread and sauce. ♪

51:21.760 --> 51:24.511

51:24.513 --> 51:26.497
♪ Sausages... ♪

51:26.499 --> 51:27.813
♪ Na-Na-Na-nah ♪

51:28.902 --> 51:32.264
I pretty much fell into
the insurance field.

51:32.266 --> 51:33.801
Nobody really plans for that kind of

51:33.803 --> 51:36.779
career so, yeah, fell into that one.

51:36.781 --> 51:39.087
And it is very stressful,

51:39.089 --> 51:42.066
especially when you have either a major

51:42.068 --> 51:46.615
disaster like the
Christchurch earthquakes or,

51:46.617 --> 51:48.953
you know, just something big that happens.

51:48.955 --> 51:51.358
Or even arguing about the value of a car,

51:52.703 --> 51:54.974
everybody thinks that what
they've purchased a car for

51:54.976 --> 51:58.242
is exactly what they're going
to get when it gets written off,

51:58.244 --> 52:00.098
but that's not the case.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.405
So, you know, it got pretty stressful,

52:02.407 --> 52:05.448
it really, really affected me.

52:05.450 --> 52:08.907
The stress now, I can't deal with.

52:08.909 --> 52:12.720
I go into a complete panic and shut down.

52:41.774 --> 52:43.762
And what do you think your dream meant?

52:45.554 --> 52:50.487
Me as a mummy and then

52:50.489 --> 52:53.688
as a child under the table

52:53.690 --> 52:58.302
is pretty much how you feel
when you're just overcome

52:58.304 --> 53:03.042
with so much emotion on
so many different levels.

53:03.044 --> 53:09.385
Dealing with depression and
anxiety is kind of like that.

53:09.387 --> 53:11.403
It's kind of like you're bound with all

53:11.405 --> 53:13.615
these emotions and you can't get free.

53:26.652 --> 53:28.863
This time last year I was in hospital.

53:31.744 --> 53:33.441
This time last year I didn't have any

53:33.443 --> 53:37.576
hope and I tried to kill myself.

53:39.497 --> 53:43.180
But this time, this
year, it's so much better.

53:44.974 --> 53:46.289
Make-up's going to run now.

54:24.245 --> 54:26.551
1999 we started.

54:27.578 --> 54:30.173
Yeah. A long time now, isn't it?

54:36.098 --> 54:38.273
The first year we did the wool shed

54:38.275 --> 54:41.476
we had a problem in our community,

54:41.478 --> 54:45.257
we had a couple of suicides
so it was really tragic.

54:45.259 --> 54:47.403
So we went to, you know, people

54:47.405 --> 54:49.677
that were our friends and we said

54:49.679 --> 54:52.111
you can have one area in the wool shed

54:52.113 --> 54:54.610
to make your own haunted house.

54:54.612 --> 54:56.628
It was sort of 1000 or
$2000 was the prize...

54:56.630 --> 54:58.774
No, it was $1000 was the prize for the...

54:58.776 --> 55:00.984
- Best room, yeah.
- For the best room, yeah.

55:00.986 --> 55:04.188
And people could vote on the best room

55:04.190 --> 55:06.014
and they would get that money

55:06.016 --> 55:08.899
but all the rest of the money
would go to start this charity.

55:11.365 --> 55:13.894
Some friends were electricians,

55:13.896 --> 55:16.744
and built the best electrocution chamber

55:16.746 --> 55:20.172
I've ever seen built anywhere
in the world, even to this day.

55:20.174 --> 55:22.285
They put 50,000 volts through it,

55:22.287 --> 55:25.297
so you get this arcing and movement

55:25.299 --> 55:29.813
and made smoke machines
and it was horrible.

55:29.815 --> 55:31.671
And then on dress rehearsal night

55:31.673 --> 55:33.721
I was walking past it and I said,

55:33.723 --> 55:35.866
"Guys, what's that smell?"

55:35.868 --> 55:38.525
And they said, "Oh, we've
got a secret weapon."

55:38.527 --> 55:40.416
And they lifted up the covers and under

55:40.418 --> 55:41.761
the covers of the chair they had

55:41.763 --> 55:43.523
a hot plate and they're cooking bacon.

55:43.525 --> 55:46.120
And you got this sizzle and smell.

55:47.273 --> 55:49.928
And I was like, "No,
you've gone a step too far."

55:49.930 --> 55:53.356
And they'd say, "We could win
it if you let us cook the bacon."

55:53.358 --> 55:54.767
But they did win and...

55:54.769 --> 55:56.400
See, bacon makes everything better.

55:56.402 --> 55:57.684
Yeah.

56:26.063 --> 56:28.560
I've got a mum that will give me a hiding.

56:28.562 --> 56:30.965
If I get a... Yeah.

56:31.990 --> 56:34.325
'Cause I'm raised up as Samoan so...

56:34.327 --> 56:36.953
got to go the way of the church, eh.

56:36.955 --> 56:38.168
Bless this place.

56:38.170 --> 56:40.058
Got to bless this place, eh.

56:40.060 --> 56:41.372
- Yeah,
- That's cool.

56:41.374 --> 56:43.007
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

56:43.009 --> 56:46.274
What about me? No, there's
girls but not girlfriend.

56:46.276 --> 56:48.612
Like, they're girls, they're
friends, but they're not girlfriends.

56:48.614 --> 56:49.701
Oh, hookups.

56:49.703 --> 56:52.487
No, not that either. Hookups, no.

56:52.489 --> 56:54.826
- Don't lie.
- Don't do that.

56:54.828 --> 56:56.588
Yeah, I walk in the night.

56:56.590 --> 56:59.152
- For the hookups.
- No.

57:03.219 --> 57:04.085
Yeah.

57:24.746 --> 57:25.866
How do you think your

57:25.868 --> 57:27.756
parents would react if they saw you as,

57:27.758 --> 57:29.007
like, zombie bride?

57:30.063 --> 57:33.168
They would be, like, tripping out.

57:33.170 --> 57:33.971
They would be...

57:35.125 --> 57:37.622
Like, 'cause they haven't
really seen me in make-up before

57:37.624 --> 57:39.734
but I know one time they did and,

57:39.736 --> 57:42.168
um, they couldn't believe it.

57:42.170 --> 57:44.956
They thought I was a freak.

57:44.958 --> 57:47.071
But the make-up that they did see

57:47.073 --> 57:48.929
me in was quite moderate make-up,

57:48.931 --> 57:49.984
not really compared to the,

57:49.986 --> 57:51.428
like, zombie, you know, for example.

57:51.430 --> 57:57.353
If they saw zombie, you know, I
think my mum would go ballistic.

58:10.807 --> 58:13.945
Beth was one of the pretty girls at school.

58:13.947 --> 58:17.020
Lovely blonde hair, great set of legs,

58:17.022 --> 58:18.945
looked super in hot pants.

58:19.936 --> 58:22.274
I do vaguely remember Andy at school

58:22.276 --> 58:25.669
but, you know, we weren't close friends.

58:25.671 --> 58:27.173
I just knew of him.

58:27.175 --> 58:28.071
He was a nerd, wasn't he?

58:28.073 --> 58:29.320
He was a nerd.

58:29.322 --> 58:32.170
Yeah, probably worked in (INAUDIBLE) room.

58:35.185 --> 58:38.033
Andy and I have been married for 39 years.

58:38.035 --> 58:41.012
It'll be 40 years in February.

58:41.014 --> 58:42.422
One of the things that Andy used to

58:42.424 --> 58:44.856
do for me when we were first married

58:44.858 --> 58:47.033
and for a few years afterwards was,

58:47.035 --> 58:49.725
I loved digging out thistles,

58:49.727 --> 58:51.775
it's one of my favourite things to do

58:51.777 --> 58:54.337
and on the farm he would go

58:54.339 --> 58:56.419
and take the shoes off
or take his boots off

58:56.421 --> 58:59.045
and go and run through the thistles for me

58:59.047 --> 59:01.512
so that I'd have thistles to dig out

59:01.514 --> 59:04.589
a day or two later when they'd
sort of festered a little bit.

59:07.633 --> 59:10.962
They were made for each
other, I think, Beth and Andy.

59:10.964 --> 59:17.179
They just understand each
other on a complex level.

01:00:00.294 --> 01:00:05.577
Most guys, they don't actually
find me too attractive.

01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.979
You know, it's just crazy
'cause I've actually got,

01:00:07.981 --> 01:00:09.580
you know, the whole thing going on.

01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:12.495
I've got the looks, I've got
the personality... you know,

01:00:12.497 --> 01:00:14.130
I'm a fun all-round zombie, you know,

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:16.467
and people just don't take the time to,

01:00:16.469 --> 01:00:18.198
you know, learn more about me.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.760
You know, it's like
judging a book by its cover,

01:00:20.762 --> 01:00:22.137
that's exactly what they do to me.

01:00:22.139 --> 01:00:24.572
And it's just so frustrating.

01:00:24.574 --> 01:00:26.815
It's so frustrating, seriously.

01:00:28.705 --> 01:00:30.561
Have you ever been in love?

01:00:30.563 --> 01:00:33.574
No, I haven't been in 'love' love.

01:00:33.576 --> 01:00:36.807
But, I don't know, maybe one day.

01:00:36.809 --> 01:00:37.579
We'll see.

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:42.381
It's easy for people to
say they've been in love.

01:00:42.383 --> 01:00:45.106
I think it's a term that
gets thrown round heaps.

01:00:46.514 --> 01:00:48.886
But, no, I can honestly say, no, I haven't.

01:00:54.299 --> 01:00:57.563
What do you think is the
hardest thing in your life?

01:00:57.565 --> 01:00:59.969
It would probably be...

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.565
...not having the ability
to make everyone happy,

01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:07.593
I think.

01:01:09.451 --> 01:01:11.339
I think you can only make so many people

01:01:11.341 --> 01:01:13.900
happy with the things you do in life and...

01:01:13.902 --> 01:01:14.927
I think the hardest thing is, yeah,

01:01:14.929 --> 01:01:16.368
just not making everyone happy.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:18.097
Not everyone's going to be happy.

01:01:18.099 --> 01:01:19.060
So, yeah...

01:01:21.239 --> 01:01:22.456
David?

01:01:23.577 --> 01:01:26.361
I know that he acts, he's
like all out there and stuff

01:01:26.363 --> 01:01:29.787
but if you really get to
know him, he's pretty private.

01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:32.161
Like, he's hidden.

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:37.572
Usually he'll like laughing and stuff
all the time but sometimes he's, like,

01:01:37.574 --> 01:01:41.897
actually really angry at
someone or something but,

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:46.510
he's pretty good at hiding
his feelings and his secrets.

01:01:46.512 --> 01:01:49.007
He doesn't really tell many secrets,

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:52.563
which is, I guess is all good.

01:01:52.565 --> 01:01:59.484
VOICEOVER AND LYRICS FROM
ELECTRIC CITY BY MUSIC

01:02:14.155 --> 01:02:15.179
Already many of the

01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:17.132
mutants disguised as human beings

01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:19.409
are walking the streets
of earth's cities...

01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:23.918
We're here together because of love.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.628
Ultimately my husband
will look past my flaws

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.127
and see me for what I truly am,

01:03:31.129 --> 01:03:32.410
which is beautiful.

01:03:33.306 --> 01:03:34.555
Which is beautiful.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:51.210
There you go. Got 'em running, Mildred.

01:03:51.212 --> 01:03:52.812
Ha ha ha.

01:03:52.814 --> 01:03:54.638
- OK, ready?
- Yeah. One.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.565
- Yep.
- Two.

01:03:55.567 --> 01:03:56.849
- Yep.
- Three.

01:04:04.697 --> 01:04:06.395
Did you have fun tonight?

01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:12.511
Beth and Julia came out and
saw me in hospital and...

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:14.913
I was just blown away by it.

01:04:14.915 --> 01:04:18.245
Like, you never get your
boss coming to see you

01:04:18.247 --> 01:04:20.935
when you're in any kind of situation

01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:22.666
like that, not unless, you know,

01:04:22.668 --> 01:04:24.170
you're really, really tight with them.

01:04:24.172 --> 01:04:27.889
But even then, they
don't make house visits.

01:04:32.116 --> 01:04:33.525
I reckon it would've been scary

01:04:33.527 --> 01:04:36.118
if I'd got admitted 30 years ago.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.495
That's terrifying.

01:04:37.497 --> 01:04:39.419
If you actually look into the history

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:42.685
of mental health at any asylum,

01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:47.073
whether it was Kingseat or any
of the other mental institutions

01:04:47.075 --> 01:04:50.950
that New Zealand or even
overseas had, it's scary.

01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:52.906
It's really scary.

01:05:30.318 --> 01:05:32.850
Good luck. I love you.

01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:16.799
I'm 21.

01:06:17.887 --> 01:06:19.709
There are things that
I could be doing better.

01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:22.307
You know, in terms of
my personal health and...

01:06:24.325 --> 01:06:26.213
...that's basically the one thing that's

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:29.097
stopping me, is my personal health and...

01:06:30.827 --> 01:06:32.494
Oh, just losing weight.

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:38.770
Diabetes is in my family, basically.

01:06:38.772 --> 01:06:41.203
One of the things that
I don't want to happen.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:41.880
But...

01:06:43.192 --> 01:06:45.559
you know, I don't necessarily
do anything about it.

01:06:45.561 --> 01:06:48.285
'Cause I love to procrastinate.

01:07:03.373 --> 01:07:05.741
People think it's weird how I'm able to

01:07:05.743 --> 01:07:08.784
compare religion and Spookers together.

01:07:08.786 --> 01:07:12.083
But I'm like, Spookers family
has helped me, basically.

01:07:12.085 --> 01:07:13.495
I feel comfortable there.

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:15.959
I feel wanted there.

01:07:15.961 --> 01:07:22.108
I feel like there's something
I can give there, basically.

01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.991
And that's the same with my religion...

01:07:24.993 --> 01:07:27.810
I feel comfort, I feel wanted,

01:07:27.812 --> 01:07:32.007
I feel like there is some
things that I can do there.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.372
There's two things that I love the most.

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:41.744
One is my religion and two is performing.

01:07:41.746 --> 01:07:43.059
And I love performing.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:44.879
A couple of months ago
I had this dream about me

01:08:44.881 --> 01:08:47.348
basically waking up in
the middle of the sea.

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:52.470
I hopped off the bed and
thought I was going to sink.

01:08:52.473 --> 01:08:54.299
And I ended up standing on water.

01:08:56.254 --> 01:09:00.413
To my amazement I was
basically walking on water.

01:09:11.725 --> 01:09:17.136
It kind of made me think of what I
could basically be doing with myself

01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:20.819
and all these ideas came
into my head, like...

01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:22.901
what I should be doing with my life,

01:09:22.903 --> 01:09:24.537
where I need to be going.

01:09:27.676 --> 01:09:29.948
One of the main thoughts
that stuck into my mind is

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.616
I need to basically leave home.

01:09:32.577 --> 01:09:34.529
So at the beginning of this week

01:09:34.531 --> 01:09:36.482
I made that decision to leave home

01:09:36.484 --> 01:09:39.014
with the support of my family.

01:09:39.015 --> 01:09:40.553
And, yeah.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:44.587
I want this to work in the sense that..

01:09:44.589 --> 01:09:47.149
I need the opportunity to learn for myself,

01:09:47.152 --> 01:09:49.875
and basically become who I need to be.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:15.724
♪ Maria Gratia plena ♪

01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:25.430

01:10:26.101 --> 01:10:29.047

Ta Da!

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:48.491
And looking back on the
last 12 months and...

01:10:48.493 --> 01:10:50.926
the journey that I've travelled,

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:54.259
I decided to talk about
it on camera so that...

01:10:57.301 --> 01:11:00.986
...there may be somebody that's
watching that's given up and...

01:11:02.299 --> 01:11:03.674
it might help.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.109
Like, they'll be able to say
that, hey, things can happen,

01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:08.639
things can turn around and...

01:11:08.641 --> 01:11:11.619
life isn't as bad as what
you'd think it would be.

01:11:29.044 --> 01:11:31.384
There's a lot that
happens behind the make-up.

01:11:35.836 --> 01:11:39.388
Life goes on and you can do anything.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:41.248
You live a normal life.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:43.777
I want to put out there that it's OK.

01:11:43.779 --> 01:11:46.021
It's OK to be who you are

01:11:46.023 --> 01:11:49.671
and it's OK to have whatever disease

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:53.035
or whatever is wrong with you,

01:11:53.037 --> 01:11:55.825
that you're still going to be beautiful.

01:12:05.498 --> 01:12:07.356
Here at Spookers you're
allowed to be a freak.

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:14.720
I think people portray the word freak
in a more negative than a positive way.

01:12:14.722 --> 01:12:16.963
I think a freak is a good
thing... someone that stands out,

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.237
that's different, expresses themselves

01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:24.427
and isn't ashamed to say
or do whatever they please.

01:12:24.429 --> 01:12:25.967
Yeah, that's what a freak is.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:38.712
I think of mental health issues, in a way,

01:12:38.714 --> 01:12:43.647
now less as a health issue and
much more as a social issue.

01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:45.888
Whether it's with someone who is 13

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:49.540
or 14 or someone who's, you know, 17,

01:12:49.542 --> 01:12:51.334
right through to 70.

01:12:51.336 --> 01:12:54.442
You know, what I see is real loneliness

01:12:55.659 --> 01:12:58.092
and feeling that they're not worthy

01:12:58.094 --> 01:13:01.904
of having relationships
or having friendships.

01:13:01.906 --> 01:13:03.987
And that's sad.

01:13:03.989 --> 01:13:06.003
That's sad that there's so much loneliness

01:13:06.005 --> 01:13:07.765
because if there's so many lonely people

01:13:07.767 --> 01:13:09.339
they just have to meet each other.

01:13:21.862 --> 01:13:24.679
People, they gather, they pack.

01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:26.376
I mean, we used to do it here.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:29.933
I suppose that's when I sort of
started to get more appreciation

01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:32.946
of that idea of being in a tribe.

01:13:35.027 --> 01:13:39.574
There was always someone who
was wise or someone who was kind

01:13:39.576 --> 01:13:40.919
or someone you could have a laugh with,

01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:44.314
there was someone who
could fulfil all your needs

01:13:44.316 --> 01:13:46.303
and it didn't have to be one person.
