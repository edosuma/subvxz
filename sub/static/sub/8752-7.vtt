00:11.491 --> 00:13.692
It's just filled with darkness.

00:13.693 --> 00:16.483
I think the house is gonna kill us.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.152
He was bad.

00:18.153 --> 00:21.184
I kept my guns loaded. Big mistake.

00:21.185 --> 00:24.156
Definitely seeing blood on the floor.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.926
He should have broken his neck.

00:25.927 --> 00:29.647
- What?
- Really strange stuff.

00:30.188 --> 00:33.888
It's like a freaking madhouse.

00:33.889 --> 00:35.558
It's really bad in here.

00:35.559 --> 00:38.272
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.273 --> 00:40.474
Something is not right.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.608
I see dead people.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.777
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.546
I speak to dead people...

00:45.547 --> 00:47.448
I get those chills.

00:47.449 --> 00:48.782
And they speak to me.

00:48.783 --> 00:51.251
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.254
There's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.903
I think she broke her neck.

00:55.904 --> 00:57.491
I rely on my partner.

00:57.492 --> 01:01.595
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:01.596 --> 01:03.096
Tellin' me the truth?

01:03.097 --> 01:06.200
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.201 --> 01:07.834
I think the Devil is down here.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.336
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.863
Who the hell would do this?

01:10.864 --> 01:12.940
But Steve and I never speak.

01:12.941 --> 01:14.908
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:14.909 --> 01:16.276
Until the very end.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.644
Who's he looking to kill?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.613
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.614 --> 01:21.915
You need to get out of here right now.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.083
Or time to get out.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.684
It was like endless darkness.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:46.105 --> 01:50.137
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

01:50.138 --> 01:55.879
I dig into the property's dark
past with interviews and research.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.020
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:01.281 --> 02:05.673
I'm in Starks, Maine. It's a small
town about 45 minutes from Augusta.

02:05.674 --> 02:08.258
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Ann Marie.

02:08.259 --> 02:11.096
She says things in her
house are out of control.

02:11.097 --> 02:14.946
Everyone is sick all the time,
things are starting to get physical.

02:14.947 --> 02:18.978
And that whatever's there is
picking on her elderly parents.

02:18.979 --> 02:23.959
I'm hoping Amy and I
can help this woman out.

02:29.326 --> 02:34.766
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:34.767 --> 02:39.837
This home has a lot of religious icons
that need to be covered or removed.

02:39.838 --> 02:45.738
Once they're cleared, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

03:02.782 --> 03:05.962
Nothing here is sacred.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.931
- Ewe.
- What?

03:17.932 --> 03:21.712
It does not feel good in here.

03:22.078 --> 03:24.478
A lot of...

03:24.557 --> 03:26.339
Anger here.

03:26.340 --> 03:31.500
There's so much fear and
anger, like, huge, huge.

03:48.179 --> 03:50.493
So, Ann Marie, I know you
sounded pretty concerned on

03:50.494 --> 03:52.484
the phone about what's
going on in the house here.

03:52.485 --> 03:54.442
You live here with your
parents, is that correct?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.255
- Yes.
- And how old are they?

03:56.256 --> 03:59.033
My mother is 74. My father is 79.

03:59.034 --> 04:01.366
- And how long have you lived here?
- 13 years.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.902
Give me a little bit of
a rundown what's going on.

04:03.903 --> 04:06.599
There's a lot of sort
of unexplained noises.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.602
We've seen things.
People have been touched.

04:09.603 --> 04:12.881
You're here 13 years. Why
are you calling us now?

04:12.882 --> 04:15.790
It seemed like things
started getting worse.

04:15.791 --> 04:17.543
People are getting attacked.

04:17.543 --> 04:21.548
All three of us, our health has gone
downhill since we moved into this house.

04:21.548 --> 04:23.656
I have breathing problems now.

04:23.657 --> 04:26.752
All three of us have developed
kidney problems since we lived here.

04:26.753 --> 04:30.164
What makes you think your health
issues have to do with the paranormal?

04:30.165 --> 04:32.058
Because it's too much of a coincidence.

04:32.059 --> 04:35.929
We see something or we
have some kind of encounter,

04:35.930 --> 04:38.464
and then, all of a sudden,
somebody has a new health issue.

04:38.465 --> 04:41.957
Like, within days of an encounter.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.603
Do you know any history about the house?

04:43.604 --> 04:48.254
We found out a few months
after we moved in that um...

04:48.255 --> 04:51.990
A woman had killed herself here.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.662
Do you know who that person
was or any information on them?

04:54.663 --> 04:58.484
It was the person who we bought
the house from, it was his wife.

04:58.485 --> 05:01.176
What are you hoping Amy and I
can do for you and your parents?

05:01.177 --> 05:02.922
I just want to know what to do.

05:02.923 --> 05:06.058
I mean, we keep getting
sicker and sicker.

05:06.059 --> 05:11.219
I think the house is
gonna kill us. I really do.

05:12.365 --> 05:14.563
It's just filled with darkness.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.558
I just feel sick.

05:16.559 --> 05:20.333
It's almost like nothing can live here.

05:20.334 --> 05:26.234
There's just all these dead people,
and it's, like, all these deaths.

05:26.246 --> 05:28.347
And there's a lot of them.

05:28.348 --> 05:34.168
This is their house. This is,
like, the house of the dead.

05:40.766 --> 05:43.936
You said the basement
you don't like at all.

05:43.937 --> 05:47.701
No. Before, if I had to,
like, change a fuse or...

05:47.702 --> 05:49.670
I don't even come down
here to do that anymore.

05:49.671 --> 05:51.950
I call my brother-in-law,
make him do it.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.176
I can hear it in your voice.
You sound like you're...

05:54.177 --> 05:56.326
Yeah, yeah. I don't want to be here.

05:56.327 --> 05:58.235
What are you feeling
when you come down here?

05:58.236 --> 06:01.373
Every time I'm down here, I
feel like people are touching me.

06:01.374 --> 06:04.924
Like hands are grabbing me from behind
and trying to, like, hold on to me.

06:04.925 --> 06:06.593
And anything else?

06:06.594 --> 06:12.450
I was down here one time with my nephew,
and two huge bins of, like, tools...

06:12.451 --> 06:14.524
Fell on me, pinned my leg.

06:14.525 --> 06:16.363
And it wasn't slanted
or anything like that?

06:16.364 --> 06:19.199
It was stuff that was
stacked forever, it was...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.157
It was solid. It never moved.

06:21.158 --> 06:23.574
You have any animals down here
that may have knocked it over?

06:23.575 --> 06:25.338
No, the animals never come down here.

06:25.339 --> 06:28.518
Something bad happens every
time somebody comes down here.

06:28.519 --> 06:31.402
Why don't we get out of here and you
show me someplace else in the house?

06:31.403 --> 06:35.183
- Okay, okay. Yup.
- All right?

06:51.231 --> 06:53.700
There were people hiding down there.

06:53.701 --> 06:56.319
I want to say they were, like, robbers.

06:56.320 --> 07:01.050
You know, but one of them was pretty bad,
on the run for a long time... a long time.

07:01.051 --> 07:03.951
I know he ends up killing somebody.
He killed somebody down there.

07:03.952 --> 07:08.948
I don't see a weapon, so
I'm assuming with his hands.

07:08.949 --> 07:13.389
I think this house is a purgatory place.

07:19.337 --> 07:21.109
What's going on up here?

07:21.110 --> 07:25.028
First, it started with just hearing,
like, footsteps up and down the hallway.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.957
Okay, and it wasn't
either one of your parents?

07:26.958 --> 07:28.758
No.

07:29.061 --> 07:32.100
- How often does this happen?
- This is a regular occurrence.

07:32.101 --> 07:34.570
This is my life.

07:34.571 --> 07:36.829
You said on the phone that
you had the house blessed.

07:36.830 --> 07:41.279
I've blessed it, and I also
took Sage and went around.

07:41.280 --> 07:46.380
- Did it help?
- No. It's like I'm under siege.

07:48.665 --> 07:52.385
There are so many dead people.

07:59.721 --> 08:01.766
There's too many. I don't know.

08:01.767 --> 08:04.260
They make it so you can't live here.

08:04.261 --> 08:08.124
They, like, run at the door, and
someone in here has blocked them.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.736
So they can't come in all the time.

08:10.737 --> 08:12.981
Well, no, it's just
one of them, I guess.

08:12.982 --> 08:15.446
When she can't get in,
she acts like an animal.

08:15.447 --> 08:16.948
Who is this?

08:16.949 --> 08:19.906
One of the weird dead people.

08:19.907 --> 08:22.252
So, is that something
that might be heard?

08:22.253 --> 08:24.173
Yeah.

08:25.625 --> 08:26.987
Is there anything else?

08:26.988 --> 08:31.108
There's a woman, an apparition, that
comes and stands in that doorway.

08:31.109 --> 08:32.760
Okay, describe her for me.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.614
She's kind of shadowy,
like, kind of black.

08:36.615 --> 08:39.470
- She's only about this tall.
- Okay.

08:39.471 --> 08:41.839
And she looks kind of like a black mist.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.509
- How long she last?
- More than half an hour.

08:44.510 --> 08:46.858
- What?
- Yeah. She just stands there.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.123
- Stares at me.
- For a half hour?

08:49.124 --> 08:51.445
That's the first time in all
these investigations I've ever

08:51.446 --> 08:54.334
heard anybody tell me more
than a couple of seconds.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.134
I've walked through her.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.843
I've come up the stairs
now three or four times,

08:58.844 --> 09:01.759
and as I turned the corner, she
was there, and I walked through her.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.061
Feels like the life's
being sucked out of you.

09:04.062 --> 09:06.935
And the first time it happened...

09:06.936 --> 09:09.930
The next day, I got
this breathing problem.

09:09.931 --> 09:14.251
That nobody's been able to figure out.

09:14.867 --> 09:20.767
The dead, in here, would be
perceived probably as shadow people.

09:21.392 --> 09:24.212
They're all over.

09:24.621 --> 09:27.032
I don't know. They're
saying they smother you.

09:27.033 --> 09:30.093
They smother them up.

09:30.355 --> 09:33.115
I can't breathe.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.622
What's going on here?

09:40.623 --> 09:42.966
My father fell down these stairs.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.001
Okay.

09:44.002 --> 09:47.103
He was coming out of the
bathroom, like, right out here.

09:47.104 --> 09:48.848
He ended up down there.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.780
He said he went down
headfirst backwards.

09:51.781 --> 09:54.611
- Okay, was his feet wet and everything?
- No.

09:54.612 --> 09:56.480
- No dizzy spells or anything?
- No.

09:56.481 --> 09:57.915
What did he say happened?

09:57.916 --> 10:02.964
When we got to the hospital, he
said that somebody pushed him.

10:02.965 --> 10:05.716
- Did you believe him?
- Oh, yeah, I believed him.

10:05.717 --> 10:08.057
I mean, he should have broken his neck.

10:08.058 --> 10:09.426
It's terrifying.

10:09.427 --> 10:11.061
We had to move his bed from downstairs.

10:11.062 --> 10:14.782
- After this incident?
- Right.

10:19.169 --> 10:25.069
I'm just seeing these weird images of,
like, dead bodies, but they're warm.

10:25.774 --> 10:28.597
They crowd around the house.

10:28.598 --> 10:32.642
And they're like, if we don't get
any rest, nobody gets any rest.

10:32.643 --> 10:35.307
And they do move strangely, too.

10:35.308 --> 10:38.640
- How do they move?
- Like zombies.

10:38.641 --> 10:42.841
And they're like, oh, just you wait.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.669
So, Adam, I was talking
to your aunt Ann Marie.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.698
She told me about the stuff that goes
on here, now, did you spend time here?

11:14.699 --> 11:15.745
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:15.746 --> 11:18.112
- I spend a lot of time here, actually.
- Okay.

11:18.113 --> 11:20.481
She's had a lot of experiences.
What about yourself?

11:20.482 --> 11:24.189
I've definitely felt
very uneasy around here.

11:24.190 --> 11:28.638
There's a lot of, like, kind
of weird vibes and energy.

11:28.639 --> 11:30.701
You know, it's kind of in the air.

11:30.702 --> 11:34.065
I've seen things that
I can't exactly explain.

11:34.066 --> 11:36.816
- Like what?
- Halloween of 2011...

11:36.817 --> 11:41.319
I was playing kind of superstitious
games with my ex-girlfriend.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.437
And one game is called
Bloody Mary, where you...

11:44.438 --> 11:48.126
You say the words Bloody Mary
into a mirror three times.

11:48.127 --> 11:52.205
And we were holding a cross in our hands
to the mirror just because, you know,

11:52.206 --> 11:55.584
I was kind of superstitious and
didn't want anything to happen.

11:55.585 --> 11:58.619
Then, the cross just got a little
bit colder and a little bit colder.

11:58.620 --> 12:01.522
And finally, we just set
it down, put the lights on.

12:01.523 --> 12:03.484
It was very shocking.

12:03.485 --> 12:05.682
Let me get this straight.
Were you doing that here?

12:05.683 --> 12:06.856
- Yeah.
- Where?

12:06.857 --> 12:08.929
- Upstairs.
- In which room?

12:08.930 --> 12:10.062
In my aunt's room.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.064
Does your aunt know about
this cross thing you did?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.800
Yeah. She's not happy.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.638
- You blame her?
- No.

12:15.639 --> 12:18.744
Okay. You know, I think your
aunt had a right to be mad at you.

12:18.745 --> 12:22.825
- Yeah. I think so, too.
- Yeah, so, she's a sweet lady, so...

12:22.826 --> 12:25.333
- I know. I love her very dearly.
- Okay.

12:25.334 --> 12:29.982
I'm very much regretful of it
now. I'm very superstitious.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.655
Anything else you
might have pulled here?

12:32.656 --> 12:34.656
- That nobody knows about?
- Not here, no.

12:34.657 --> 12:36.908
You think you caused all the
problems that are happening?

12:36.909 --> 12:40.218
I don't know what exactly
to think about all of this.

12:40.219 --> 12:43.218
But it does seem that way.

12:43.219 --> 12:45.651
Thinking about all the events
and tying them together,

12:45.652 --> 12:50.684
I'm just really, like, scared
that maybe I'm responsible.

12:50.685 --> 12:54.412
I mean, I kind of tried
to make up explanations.

12:54.413 --> 12:57.277
I always try to believe in
a higher power, you know?

12:57.278 --> 13:00.986
God and something that's good
and loving and protecting.

13:00.987 --> 13:04.526
And if there's something negative
and wishing ill upon my family,

13:04.527 --> 13:06.225
I'm very upset about that.

13:06.226 --> 13:07.259
Right.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.822
You know, it does sometimes feel
like we're up against something.

13:10.823 --> 13:15.080
And I don't know... I don't want
to say that definitively, but...

13:15.081 --> 13:17.961
I'm scared of it.

13:21.571 --> 13:26.131
There's just some
weird [Bleep] going on.

13:26.855 --> 13:29.855
Really strange stuff.

13:31.542 --> 13:36.901
There's, like... somebody's doing,
like, all these seances and stuff.

13:36.902 --> 13:40.926
But there's... but they
shouldn't be, and they know it.

13:40.927 --> 13:44.587
Someone religious is doing it.

13:50.882 --> 13:52.998
Steve, I was talking to
your sister-in-law Ann Marie.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.647
And she was telling me about the
stuff going on in the house here.

13:55.648 --> 13:56.447
Yeah.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.654
She mentions you come over
once in awhile to help out.

13:58.655 --> 14:01.371
You got to be concerned for your in-laws
I would think, and your sister-in-law.

14:01.372 --> 14:04.888
I'm always concerned
because they've all been ill.

14:04.889 --> 14:07.057
I've always sort of
worried about them here.

14:07.058 --> 14:10.259
So, since you spend time here,
have you had an experience?

14:10.260 --> 14:15.265
I have had some sort of uncomfortable
feeling about the house at times.

14:15.266 --> 14:17.173
Okay. Any place in particular?

14:17.174 --> 14:21.289
Well, in the basement, when
I was bracing up the shower,

14:21.290 --> 14:26.276
the next day, I contracted kind of a
numbness throughout my hands and shoulders.

14:26.277 --> 14:29.379
So, did anything go wrong
when you were working?

14:29.380 --> 14:33.567
Nothing that I could say. It was
just pretty much straightforward work.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.518
My fingers are still
numb for the most part.

14:35.519 --> 14:38.698
- Ever since that one time you've been...
- Ever since that time.

14:38.699 --> 14:40.457
It's been three months.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.188
Have you been to a doctor?

14:42.189 --> 14:45.062
Yeah, I've been to several.
They're not sure exactly what it is.

14:45.063 --> 14:46.796
Okay. Anything else?

14:46.797 --> 14:52.217
Sometimes, it feels like there's,
like, a darkness that settles.

14:52.218 --> 14:57.437
It felt like there was a leaning toward,
you know, being more argumentative...

14:57.438 --> 15:01.638
More negative about things in general.

15:05.046 --> 15:07.579
These dead people... they
don't want to talk to me.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.579
They know...

15:09.580 --> 15:13.805
Exactly why the [Bleep] I'm
here, and they do not want it.

15:13.806 --> 15:18.546
They are like, get the
[Bleep] out of here.

15:18.692 --> 15:24.452
Thick... they're thick. They're
pretty [Bleep] strong, man.

15:24.593 --> 15:28.168
The amount of dead people in
this house is overwhelming.

15:28.169 --> 15:30.264
I have no idea why they're all here,

15:30.265 --> 15:36.165
but they hate living people and
have disturbing ways of showing it.

15:36.925 --> 15:38.869
A very emotional house.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.079
Do you mean that it
affects people's emotions?

15:41.080 --> 15:44.680
I would think that it might.

15:45.288 --> 15:48.794
Because it's a very angry...

15:48.795 --> 15:51.311
Fearful house.

15:51.312 --> 15:57.212
Everybody's confused in this place.
It's like a freaking madhouse.

16:13.474 --> 16:17.211
Ann Marie told me she thinks a
woman committed suicide in her house.

16:17.212 --> 16:20.332
I did some digging, and
her story checks out.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.852
I was actually able to
locate the victim's husband,

16:22.853 --> 16:28.753
and as painful as it is, he's agreed
to tell me exactly what happened.

16:35.445 --> 16:37.746
Well, Ron, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.780
You're welcome.

16:38.781 --> 16:40.659
I'm so sorry to hear
about your wife, Mary.

16:40.660 --> 16:41.850
Yeah.

16:41.851 --> 16:45.106
- I assume you still...
- I think of her a lot.

16:45.107 --> 16:46.961
Okay.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.722
She was my Mary.

16:50.192 --> 16:53.492
This is her right there.

16:54.541 --> 16:59.281
She had a serious bone
disease in her back.

17:00.801 --> 17:04.604
And leading up to her suicide,
her condition got worse?

17:04.605 --> 17:06.069
Yes, it did.

17:06.070 --> 17:09.150
Her back was really deteriorating.

17:09.151 --> 17:13.714
Now, can you, if it's okay with
you, tell me about what happened?

17:13.714 --> 17:19.615
Well, how I remember it, I had
to go to the V.A. hospital...

17:21.282 --> 17:24.343
And uh, I came home.

17:24.555 --> 17:27.915
My dog was going bananas.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.525
And I found her in the dining room.

17:31.526 --> 17:34.649
On the floor, and there was blood.

17:34.650 --> 17:38.790
She had shot herself with my 30-30.

17:38.984 --> 17:40.294
Wow.

17:40.295 --> 17:44.136
I kept my guns loaded, and
I showed her how to use them.

17:44.137 --> 17:46.537
Big mistake.

17:47.493 --> 17:51.731
I should have never
left her alone, but...

17:51.732 --> 17:54.461
- And I know you must feel guilty about it.
- Oh, yes, I do.

17:54.462 --> 18:00.362
When I left that morning, I never
said, goodbye, or, I love you.

18:06.100 --> 18:10.738
The dead that are here...
they'll just make you miserable.

18:10.739 --> 18:12.959
Miserable.

18:13.194 --> 18:15.228
I just feel like a lot...

18:15.229 --> 18:19.672
There was a lot of bad things
that hap... like, consecutively.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.604
Like what?

18:21.605 --> 18:26.585
Like I am definitely
seeing blood on the floor.

18:28.388 --> 18:32.528
Definitely seeing blood on the floor.

18:34.094 --> 18:39.734
Someone's like, yeah, people
met a lot of terrible ends.

18:42.552 --> 18:45.974
Now that I know someone committed
suicide on my client's property...

18:45.975 --> 18:48.619
I need to see if anything
else went down there.

18:48.620 --> 18:51.862
So I hit the books at the local library.

18:51.863 --> 18:57.208
And the only other death I can
uncover is a guy named Angier Gray.

18:57.209 --> 19:02.249
Turns out he died in my
client's home in 1935.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.551
I want to find out if
there's any more to his story.

19:08.552 --> 19:11.176
I'm on my way to meet with a
local historian who says Gray's

19:11.177 --> 19:17.077
time in Ann Marie's home was
filled with heartbreak and loss.

19:23.296 --> 19:26.546
So, Ernie, during my research, I
came across this guy Angier Gray.

19:26.547 --> 19:28.213
What can you tell me about him?

19:28.214 --> 19:30.725
Angier was a pretty prosperous guy.

19:30.726 --> 19:33.733
He was involved in a lot of
businesses... store keeping.

19:33.734 --> 19:35.661
He was a farmer.

19:35.662 --> 19:41.562
In fact, here's a photo of Angier
with his granddaughter Caroline.

19:41.863 --> 19:45.664
Was he sick? Because he
looks a little emaciated here.

19:45.665 --> 19:49.762
Well, that's what years of
hard work will do for you.

19:49.763 --> 19:53.195
So, now, you had mentioned on the phone
that he had some tragedies in his life.

19:53.196 --> 19:54.730
What were you talking about?

19:54.731 --> 19:57.773
Angier had been given
the farm by his siblings

19:57.774 --> 20:00.736
after his father died
but with a condition.

20:00.737 --> 20:05.374
He had to support his mother
and his brother George.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.601
Who was mentally disabled.

20:08.602 --> 20:12.830
But there was actually a bit of
difficulty between George and Angier.

20:12.831 --> 20:17.691
And in 1911, George
physically assaults Angier.

20:18.174 --> 20:19.422
He leaves.

20:19.423 --> 20:22.420
Angier closes the door and
never allows George back.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.482
Wow.

20:23.483 --> 20:27.822
And Angier was estranged
from the family after that.

20:27.823 --> 20:30.197
Now, do you know what he died of?

20:30.198 --> 20:35.058
He died in the house you're investigating
of apoplexy, which is a stroke.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.826
Ernie, let me ask you a question,
I know a lot of people were buried

20:37.827 --> 20:41.128
on the property they lived on back
in those days, what about Angier?

20:41.129 --> 20:44.512
He wouldn't have been buried there, but
there is something you might want to know.

20:44.513 --> 20:46.740
It's that the house that
you're investigating...

20:46.741 --> 20:51.925
Is either adjacent to or encroaches
on an old village burial ground.

20:51.926 --> 20:54.386
Really? Okay.

20:58.074 --> 21:00.046
There was this man...

21:00.047 --> 21:02.807
And he was mean.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.982
A very mean person.

21:07.180 --> 21:10.041
He's, like, pasty, and...

21:10.042 --> 21:13.207
He looks like an undertaker just...

21:13.208 --> 21:15.188
Nasty.

21:15.563 --> 21:17.626
But he's very here.

21:17.627 --> 21:20.741
Like, he's very much
a part of this house.

21:20.742 --> 21:26.596
It's really strange because I think
he was kind of deserted by his family.

21:26.597 --> 21:28.517
Okay.

21:32.184 --> 21:34.884
He's all alone.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.825
He was bad.

21:53.427 --> 21:57.164
Ernie said my client's property is
either built on or next to a graveyard.

21:57.165 --> 22:00.742
This could be a huge
development in the case.

22:00.743 --> 22:06.643
I'm on my way to interview a local
cemetery owner to see if it's true.

22:14.143 --> 22:17.289
So, Paul, is it true that
the house I'm investigating...

22:17.290 --> 22:20.489
There might have been a graveyard either
under it or at least right next to it?

22:20.490 --> 22:22.448
Yes. That's true.

22:22.449 --> 22:26.828
In fact, my great-great-great-grandfather
was originally buried there.

22:26.829 --> 22:28.664
He died in 1822.

22:28.665 --> 22:32.234
And he was reburied in this cemetery.

22:32.235 --> 22:34.878
Now, let me ask you a question.
What was a reason they got moved?

22:34.879 --> 22:38.366
There was a concern about water
contamination of the public well

22:38.367 --> 22:42.495
that was immediately across the
road from the graveyard site.

22:42.496 --> 22:45.980
Okay. Now, did they all
get moved to this cemetery?

22:45.981 --> 22:50.731
No. They were moved to a variety
of cemeteries around the town.

22:50.732 --> 22:53.094
- Some were moved to this site.
- Okay.

22:53.095 --> 22:56.479
But there were others in
several other cemeteries.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.359
All right, so, when did this take place?

22:58.360 --> 23:01.778
Well, we know the
cemetery was there in 1860.

23:01.779 --> 23:05.901
I have a map here of
the village in 1860.

23:05.902 --> 23:09.500
And you can see there's
a cemetery marked

23:09.501 --> 23:12.790
adjacent to the home that
you are investigating.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.801
Right, this is the corner, and this
is the cemetery right here, okay.

23:15.802 --> 23:20.322
And this is an 1883
map of the same area.

23:20.323 --> 23:22.717
And you can see there's
no cemetery at that site.

23:22.718 --> 23:25.741
Okay. So, we know it had
to happen between that time.

23:25.742 --> 23:26.765
That's right.

23:26.766 --> 23:31.226
So, how did the moving process work? I
mean, did they just dig the body up and...

23:31.227 --> 23:33.428
Well, they did in some cases.

23:33.429 --> 23:36.304
And in other cases, the bodies may have

23:36.305 --> 23:39.482
not been relocated, may
still be in the ground there.

23:39.483 --> 23:43.307
There have been a number
of bones allegedly found

23:43.308 --> 23:48.408
at the site where this
old burial ground existed.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.001
Somehow, these people are dying here.

23:55.002 --> 23:56.496
Or...

23:56.497 --> 23:58.777
Died here?

23:59.154 --> 24:03.234
It's their home. It's their place.

24:06.601 --> 24:09.841
These dead people are...

24:10.183 --> 24:12.412
Like, none of them are okay.

24:12.413 --> 24:14.591
There's too many of them, and...

24:14.592 --> 24:17.960
They're too sick and too much...

24:17.961 --> 24:20.229
Death, and...

24:20.230 --> 24:23.797
Like you can't escape their pain.

24:23.798 --> 24:27.938
There are so many people's thoughts.

24:31.013 --> 24:34.073
It just is not good.

24:34.846 --> 24:37.358
If they did leave the body there,
what was the reason for that?

24:37.359 --> 24:39.394
Well, possibly couldn't find it.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.042
Some of these bodies might not
have had any headstones with them...

24:42.043 --> 24:43.590
- Originally.
- Okay.

24:43.591 --> 24:46.761
In other cases, the families
may have been too poor

24:46.762 --> 24:50.564
to pay for the cost of exhuming
the body and relocating it.

24:50.565 --> 24:53.119
This cemetery was a
privately owned cemetery.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.569
It was not owned by the town.

24:55.570 --> 24:59.672
So, this was a private decision
obviously with community support.

24:59.673 --> 25:02.649
- Because of the water supply issue.
- Okay.

25:02.650 --> 25:05.124
So, if a family member
decided, well, you know what?

25:05.125 --> 25:08.340
I don't have the money or the
means to have the body moved,

25:08.341 --> 25:11.124
even though they moved the cemetery,
the bodies could still be there.

25:11.125 --> 25:12.087
That's true.

25:12.088 --> 25:14.558
Now, would they ever move a
headstone and not the body?

25:14.559 --> 25:17.029
Yes. Headstones are easy to move.

25:17.030 --> 25:19.393
Bodies are much more difficult.

25:19.394 --> 25:24.673
And some of the bones were,
in all likelihood, left behind.

25:24.674 --> 25:29.894
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

25:31.609 --> 25:36.661
I don't think that they were very
well taken care of when they died.

25:36.662 --> 25:39.596
They were saying, um...

25:39.597 --> 25:44.491
You know, that they are like the true
lost souls, the ones that people have...

25:44.492 --> 25:48.992
Forgotten about or
turned their backs on.

25:51.992 --> 25:53.609
They were discarded.

25:53.610 --> 25:56.910
They're discarded people.

26:02.851 --> 26:06.018
I encountered dozens of
dead people during my walk.

26:06.019 --> 26:07.867
But what has me the most concerned,

26:07.868 --> 26:12.741
is the bizarre scene I saw
in the downstairs bedroom.

26:12.742 --> 26:17.782
You could see their eyes,
like, in the darkness.

26:18.620 --> 26:22.663
And there were three on each side and
then the three or four that came forward.

26:22.664 --> 26:26.516
To talk to me at the end of the bed.

26:26.517 --> 26:31.077
And they all had,
like, thick, long hair.

26:33.626 --> 26:36.746
Is this what you saw?

26:36.994 --> 26:38.854
Yes.

27:01.805 --> 27:04.718
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:04.719 --> 27:09.759
we're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.230
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Ann Marie and her nephew Adam.

27:14.231 --> 27:17.875
Ann Marie actually lives
here with her elderly parents.

27:17.876 --> 27:21.798
She believes that whatever's in this
house is making them all very sick.

27:21.799 --> 27:25.246
And is possibly trying to kill them.

27:25.247 --> 27:28.035
Adam's very close to his family
and is worried about them,

27:28.036 --> 27:31.895
but he also believes that he may
have caused what's going on here.

27:31.896 --> 27:37.796
So, with that being said, I'm gonna
ask her to describe her walk for us.

27:40.089 --> 27:42.132
This was the first time on a walk

27:42.133 --> 27:45.553
that I almost didn't make
it all the way through.

27:45.554 --> 27:47.033
I almost left.

27:47.034 --> 27:50.452
I was overwhelmed with how many dead...

27:50.453 --> 27:53.064
Were located here.

27:53.065 --> 27:56.531
This is a house of the dead.

27:56.532 --> 28:01.692
It's like a purgatory or
a way station for them.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.674
How many dead people are here?

28:03.675 --> 28:06.615
Over 20 in the house and, like...

28:06.616 --> 28:10.098
- God.
- Maybe like 30 or 40 outside.

28:10.099 --> 28:13.188
I may have an explanation
for why you saw so many dead.

28:13.189 --> 28:16.835
This house is either built on or...

28:16.836 --> 28:19.157
Literally right next door to
what used to be a graveyard.

28:19.158 --> 28:20.463
Wow.

28:20.464 --> 28:23.284
I got two maps...

28:23.469 --> 28:27.069
Here, this one is from 1860.

28:30.992 --> 28:34.385
And it shows a cemetery right
here along their property line.

28:34.386 --> 28:37.921
Now, I have another map from 1883...

28:37.922 --> 28:42.062
That shows the cemetery's not there.

28:43.945 --> 28:46.687
- It makes sense.
- So, you all right with that?

28:46.688 --> 28:51.868
I mean, I don't know if you can be all
right with a purgatory of dead people.

28:51.869 --> 28:56.443
There's just so much stuff they didn't tell
us about this house before we bought it.

28:56.444 --> 29:02.344
- I'd be really mad about that were I you.
- That just really, really pisses me off.

29:03.812 --> 29:06.899
There's one male that's here.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.360
And he is...

29:09.812 --> 29:12.032
Not okay.

29:12.652 --> 29:17.397
He's, like, pasty, and he
looks like an undertaker...

29:17.398 --> 29:19.738
Just nasty.

29:20.491 --> 29:24.751
He just seemed extremely unwell to me.

29:25.183 --> 29:29.089
But he was very much
estranged from his family.

29:29.090 --> 29:34.620
I might be able to maybe give
you an idea of who it could be.

29:34.621 --> 29:39.106
There was a guy named Angier Gray
that lived here from 1917 to 1935.

29:39.107 --> 29:42.827
I've got his death certificate.
He lived and died in this house.

29:42.828 --> 29:47.208
He died of apoplexy, which is a stroke.

29:48.757 --> 29:52.465
He lived on a farm with his mother
and brother not far from here.

29:52.466 --> 29:54.457
When you said he was
estranged from the family...

29:54.458 --> 29:57.022
Angier had to take care of
his younger brother George,

29:57.023 --> 29:58.613
who was mentally handicapped.

29:58.614 --> 30:01.866
But George got into a physical
fight with him and left the house.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.620
And Angier never let him back in.

30:05.621 --> 30:09.008
That's where the estrangement
comes with the family.

30:09.009 --> 30:11.891
You said the guy reminded
you of, like, an undertaker.

30:11.892 --> 30:15.732
- Yes.
- This is how he looked.

30:17.741 --> 30:22.481
Amy, do you think this
is the guy you saw?

30:23.387 --> 30:24.679
Yeah.

30:24.680 --> 30:29.758
Do you think that this man in
particular is actively trying to harm...

30:29.759 --> 30:31.712
Everyone here?

30:31.713 --> 30:33.582
He's contributing.

30:33.583 --> 30:37.653
His emotional state of
being, loneliness, anger...

30:37.654 --> 30:39.670
That radiates out.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.814
Can we be influenced by him?

30:41.815 --> 30:46.195
I think that's a huge possibility, yes.

30:48.861 --> 30:50.930
What else is going on in this house?

30:50.931 --> 30:53.410
The basement, there was...

30:53.411 --> 30:55.767
Four people.

30:55.768 --> 31:00.470
One of the guys from downstairs told me
that all of them were hiding from the law.

31:00.471 --> 31:02.147
He told me he killed somebody.

31:02.148 --> 31:04.858
I think he did it with his hands.

31:04.859 --> 31:06.105
Oh, my God.

31:06.106 --> 31:09.391
Now, the thing is you got a cemetery
that was here from the 1700s.

31:09.392 --> 31:11.812
There's no records on
who was buried here.

31:11.813 --> 31:14.648
I do know that no murderer
lived in the house.

31:14.649 --> 31:18.270
But that doesn't mean that he
might not have been buried here.

31:18.271 --> 31:20.163
You don't like to go
into the basement I could

31:20.164 --> 31:22.786
barely get you down
there to interview you.

31:22.787 --> 31:24.956
I always feel like
someone's grabbing me.

31:24.957 --> 31:25.772
Okay.

31:25.773 --> 31:30.798
Like, it feels like I'm
being attacked from behind.

31:30.799 --> 31:33.383
Adam, can you tell Amy
what physically happened to

31:33.384 --> 31:35.609
your father after he did
the work in the basement?

31:35.610 --> 31:39.145
He began to have a lot of
muscle pain in his arms,

31:39.146 --> 31:42.805
and his wrists and his hands, and
he couldn't move his hands anymore.

31:42.806 --> 31:45.446
And no doctor can figure out
what the hell is wrong with him.

31:45.447 --> 31:46.250
Yeah.

31:46.251 --> 31:48.912
Every time someone goes in
the basement, they're ill.

31:48.913 --> 31:53.173
Somebody gets ill or hurt right after.

31:53.276 --> 31:56.253
I don't want to deal
with negative energies.

31:56.254 --> 32:00.054
It's bad enough having people among
the living that are jerks, you know?

32:00.055 --> 32:03.542
Well, the dead in this house
are very angry for a reason.

32:03.543 --> 32:08.388
They felt that the living had turned
them away and turned their backs on them.

32:08.389 --> 32:12.904
And that they were not well
taken care of when they died.

32:12.905 --> 32:18.059
They feel like they're true lost
souls and that they cannot be saved.

32:18.060 --> 32:20.828
This is where I can probably help
you out with why they're so angry.

32:20.829 --> 32:26.254
Now, when the cemetery was moved,
a lot of bodies were left behind.

32:26.255 --> 32:31.602
Back then, the family would
have to pay to move the body.

32:31.603 --> 32:34.600
A lot of people didn't have the money,
so they ripped the headstones off,

32:34.601 --> 32:38.921
and their bodies were just left behind.

32:42.437 --> 32:44.069
What else did you see?

32:44.070 --> 32:48.950
I was seeing seances down here
trying to communicate with the dead.

32:48.951 --> 32:52.380
Several of these people
over the years knew that they

32:52.381 --> 32:57.075
really should not be doing
this, but they did it anyways.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.130
Remember when I told you,

32:59.131 --> 33:02.873
that Adam feels he may be responsible
for what's going on over here?

33:02.874 --> 33:05.195
Adam, why don't you tell
her what you told me?

33:05.196 --> 33:09.320
On Halloween of 2011,
me and my ex-girlfriend,

33:09.321 --> 33:14.291
we were, you know, just playing around,
doing, you know, spooky Halloween things.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.531
And in the upstairs bedroom,
we played Bloody Mary.

33:17.532 --> 33:20.235
Yeah, I know what Bloody Mary is.

33:20.236 --> 33:22.960
A lot of the dead feel here,

33:22.961 --> 33:26.180
you know, the disrespect feeling
like they're in purgatory.

33:26.181 --> 33:30.935
There's a lot of animosity here,
so don't blame yourself for that.

33:30.936 --> 33:34.779
I feel more of a clear
conscience that it's not me,

33:34.780 --> 33:38.138
but I feel terrible about these
people who feel like they're outcasted.

33:38.139 --> 33:40.679
- Yeah.
- Right.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.329
Also, in the upstairs bedroom...

33:44.330 --> 33:47.869
The dead... they couldn't
get into the room.

33:47.870 --> 33:50.872
The interesting thing was
I saw, like, a barrier up.

33:50.873 --> 33:54.551
One particular dead person, who's a
female, she gets crazy, and she'll, like,

33:54.552 --> 33:58.879
act like an animal and run down the
hallway and, like, try to get in the room.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.378
And the dead woman was pissed.

34:02.379 --> 34:04.468
Wow, that freaks me out.

34:04.469 --> 34:10.056
Because I Saged all the rooms
upstairs, and I did do a blessing.

34:10.056 --> 34:14.130
So, her Saging upstairs, could that have
been what stopped the woman from coming in?

34:14.130 --> 34:16.795
- Mm hmm.
- Are they mad at her for that?

34:16.795 --> 34:18.656
Yes.

34:19.609 --> 34:23.902
I did do a sketch of the
dead down here in this room.

34:23.904 --> 34:26.099
They really unnerved me.

34:26.100 --> 34:29.199
They were congregating...

34:29.201 --> 34:31.043
And it was all around the bed.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.178
Oh, my God.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.947
And that's where Ann Marie's dad sleeps.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.929
Right.

34:46.293 --> 34:50.230
Just don't freak out. But just...

34:50.231 --> 34:52.630
Oh, my God.

34:58.989 --> 35:02.806
These are the people who
feel lost, who feel discarded.

35:02.807 --> 35:06.333
They're very angry, and unfortunately,

35:06.334 --> 35:10.982
they're trying to become,
like, these inhuman creatures.

35:10.983 --> 35:14.711
Now, one of the main reasons,
her breaking point for calling

35:14.712 --> 35:17.456
us in is an incident that
happened here with her father.

35:17.457 --> 35:18.790
Tell her what happened.

35:18.791 --> 35:23.293
My father was coming out
of the bathroom, and he...

35:23.294 --> 35:25.664
Fell down the stairs
backwards headfirst.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.153
Oh, my gosh.

35:27.154 --> 35:30.949
And when we got to the hospital...

35:30.950 --> 35:34.008
He said he was pushed.

35:34.009 --> 35:37.045
Seeing him in that state
and seeing all the bruises,

35:37.046 --> 35:41.912
and all the trauma it caused,
it was just really awful.

35:41.913 --> 35:44.987
Could they have pushed
her father down the stairs?

35:44.988 --> 35:47.388
I think so.

35:47.820 --> 35:50.344
Tell her about what you see upstairs.

35:50.345 --> 35:54.696
In my doorway of my bedroom,
it was definitely shadowy.

35:54.697 --> 35:56.794
I think it's a woman.

35:56.795 --> 36:00.957
Never crosses the doorway
but stands and stares.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.087
And I mean for like
30 minutes at a time.

36:03.088 --> 36:04.335
Mm-hmm.

36:04.336 --> 36:07.037
And then, I have walked through her.

36:07.038 --> 36:09.407
It feels like it kind of
sucks the life out of me.

36:09.408 --> 36:12.525
The day after I walked through her...

36:12.526 --> 36:14.795
- I came down with a breathing problem.
- Okay.

36:14.796 --> 36:17.304
That they have not been able
to figure out what it is.

36:17.305 --> 36:20.579
- Probably the one that you blocked out.
- That's horrible.

36:20.580 --> 36:23.580
What am I gonna do?

36:26.303 --> 36:30.695
So, here's how the living might
be affected by the dead here.

36:30.696 --> 36:35.234
The dead truly believe that there
should not be living people here.

36:35.235 --> 36:39.246
Two things that these guys
do is that they will...

36:39.247 --> 36:42.171
Make you very ill here.

36:42.172 --> 36:45.311
And they want to smother you.

36:45.312 --> 36:49.746
And that's one of the ways
that they'll try to attack.

36:49.747 --> 36:53.605
I can't walk more than 20
feet without being out of air.

36:53.606 --> 36:59.306
It's like somebody, like,
kicked the air out of my body.

36:59.622 --> 37:04.090
I really feel like this
house is trying to kill us.

37:04.091 --> 37:09.163
They told me they won't allow
anything to live here, nothing.

37:09.164 --> 37:12.884
It scares me to death, really.

37:14.384 --> 37:16.460
It's so hard to live in this house.

37:16.461 --> 37:21.141
Yeah, it just feels
like it never lets up.

37:35.627 --> 37:39.277
I really feel like this
house is trying to kill us.

37:39.278 --> 37:44.296
They told me they won't allow
anything to live here, nothing.

37:44.297 --> 37:47.552
It scares me to death, really.

37:47.553 --> 37:49.621
It's so hard to live in this house.

37:49.622 --> 37:54.302
Yeah, it just feels
like it never lets up.

37:56.528 --> 37:58.567
Now, have you seen anything else?

37:58.568 --> 38:01.714
No. That's the gist of it.

38:01.715 --> 38:05.459
Well, there's one major event
that did take place in this house.

38:05.460 --> 38:09.229
There was a woman that lived here in
1997 by the name of Mary Frechette.

38:09.230 --> 38:12.799
She shot and killed
herself right in this room.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.943
So, when I spoke to her husband, Ron...

38:15.944 --> 38:19.206
I asked him to explain what happened, he
said he came home from the V.A. hospital,

38:19.207 --> 38:22.357
and he found her in a pool of blood.

38:22.358 --> 38:26.557
She had been sick, you know?
Her lifestyle was deteriorating.

38:26.558 --> 38:28.547
So, when you said you
thought somebody had died,

38:28.548 --> 38:31.452
you know, committed
suicide, you were right.

38:31.453 --> 38:34.872
Any ideas why you
might not have seen her?

38:34.873 --> 38:39.374
I just lost a friend recently to
suicide, and he shot himself in the head.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.990
So, that's probably
why I didn't see that.

38:41.991 --> 38:45.699
Sometimes, we'll block out
things we don't want to perceive.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.403
Okay.

38:47.404 --> 38:49.670
That was just a week and a half ago.

38:49.671 --> 38:51.260
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

38:51.261 --> 38:53.601
Yeah. Okay.

38:57.269 --> 38:59.789
That happened.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.493
Okay.

39:04.531 --> 39:08.611
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:16.837 --> 39:21.099
Well, I know you guys have been hit with
a lot of horrific information tonight.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.998
But, Ann Marie, now you
know why your family's

39:23.999 --> 39:25.911
been going through hell
since you've been here.

39:25.912 --> 39:28.016
The question is how do you fix it.

39:28.017 --> 39:33.917
For that answer, I'm gonna
turn it over to my partner, Amy.

39:38.186 --> 39:41.846
What I'm going to say, um...

39:41.886 --> 39:46.291
It's kind of difficult for me
because on the one hand I feel...

39:46.292 --> 39:51.595
Very sorry for these people, but
they kind of damned themselves.

39:51.596 --> 39:54.068
They've done that via attempted murder.

39:54.069 --> 39:58.814
We have to proceed as if they
were some type of a demonic...

39:58.815 --> 40:00.975
Presence.

40:02.228 --> 40:07.848
They are not demons, but they
have become a type of evil.

40:07.849 --> 40:10.737
The first thing is to move them on.

40:10.738 --> 40:14.757
And it has to be a religious,
holy person, so, you know,

40:14.758 --> 40:18.478
it could be a minister, a priest, you
know, whatever you feel comfortable with.

40:18.479 --> 40:22.151
Sit down with that person, tell
them exactly what happened here.

40:22.152 --> 40:25.268
So that they can then
perform whatever...

40:25.269 --> 40:28.640
Religious ceremonies they need to.

40:28.641 --> 40:31.754
This person will move
the good people on?

40:31.755 --> 40:32.887
Right.

40:32.888 --> 40:38.788
The other thing is is that you are
going to have to have an exorcism done.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.320
Of the land and the house.

40:49.091 --> 40:50.490
Okay.

40:50.491 --> 40:55.763
You all right? You didn't want to
hear that word exorcism, did you?

40:55.764 --> 40:59.866
I like to believe that
no one is beyond saving.

40:59.867 --> 41:04.038
Well, in this case, you got to fight
fire with fire, kid. You know what I mean?

41:04.039 --> 41:06.808
They are fully conscious individuals.

41:06.809 --> 41:09.778
They know what they're doing,
and they know right from wrong.

41:09.779 --> 41:11.246
And they're hurting my family.

41:11.247 --> 41:15.484
And they made a decision, and
that decision is unacceptable.

41:15.485 --> 41:17.748
- It scares me because...
- Mm hmm.

41:17.749 --> 41:20.355
This is a real thing.

41:20.356 --> 41:22.624
It's all very overwhelming.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.596
I'm sorry.

41:24.597 --> 41:28.788
I'm digging into a bottomless
pit in my heart here.

41:28.789 --> 41:31.727
I... I'm terrified.

41:31.728 --> 41:33.022
You're up for the fight?

41:33.023 --> 41:36.386
Yeah. I mean, I'm not gonna let
it kill my family or me, either.

41:36.387 --> 41:38.438
Are you gonna buck up, or
are you gonna sit there...

41:38.439 --> 41:42.014
Yeah. No, I'm ready to kill the [Bleep].

41:42.015 --> 41:47.895
But let's go in with compassion
and then go for the fight.

41:49.463 --> 41:53.782
The entities inside this house will stop
at nothing to torment the living here.

41:53.783 --> 41:57.326
But I believe if Ann Marie and
her family follow my advice...

41:57.327 --> 42:03.227
They'll free themselves from the
evil that's been haunting them.
