_

01:13.000 --> 01:14.450
Mmm-hmm.

01:19.615 --> 01:21.080
- Gotcha!
- Hey!

01:21.120 --> 01:25.040
Now it's your turn to be
"it" and my turn to hide!

01:25.075 --> 01:27.910
Yeah, okay, fine.
But first...

01:27.945 --> 01:29.950
Could you move your paw?

01:29.985 --> 01:32.080
I still don't get it, Kion.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.700
Why are we playing
hide-and-seek in the first place?

01:34.735 --> 01:36.540
It's not just
hide-and-seek.

01:36.575 --> 01:39.210
It's a way to practice
our tracking skills.

01:39.245 --> 01:41.160
Ah, that does
sound better.

01:41.195 --> 01:43.830
Yeah! Besides, it's fun!

01:43.865 --> 01:46.540
How long did it take Kion
to find you two?

01:46.575 --> 01:48.210
Somehow he found me
right away.

01:48.245 --> 01:50.000
He laughed when
I walked past him.

01:50.035 --> 01:52.080
Kion found me pretty fast, too.

01:52.115 --> 01:54.750
What about Beshte?
Haven't you found him?

01:54.785 --> 01:56.790
Oh, yeah, I found him.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.610
I just haven't told him yet.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.249
Okay, Beshte!

02:00.250 --> 02:02.790
You can come out from
behind the rocks now!

02:02.825 --> 02:05.000
You got me.

02:05.035 --> 02:07.080
Pretty good hiding place,
though, right?

02:07.115 --> 02:09.120
I have to admit,
for someone your size,

02:09.155 --> 02:11.949
- you're a surprisingly good hider.
- Thanks, Ono.

02:11.984 --> 02:14.789
Okay, Fuli. Everyone's
been "it" but you.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.620
Close your eyes
so we can go hide.

02:16.655 --> 02:19.040
Hmm. Fine. But I warn you.

02:19.075 --> 02:22.120
I'm the fastest finder
in the Pride Lands!

02:22.155 --> 02:25.160
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm the fastest hider!

02:28.621 --> 02:32.701
He does realize that doesn't
count for anything, right?

02:32.736 --> 02:33.815
I'm not sure he does.

02:34.289 --> 02:37.869
Okay.
Everybody go hide!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.369
Ready or not, here I come!

02:57.785 --> 03:00.789
- Excuse me?
- Who's in there?

03:01.620 --> 03:04.851
Just me.
I didn't mean to startle you,

03:04.852 --> 03:09.291
- but you were standing on my hoof.
- I was? I'm sorry!

03:09.330 --> 03:11.455
Say, I don't think we've met.

03:11.456 --> 03:16.040
- I'm Beshte! What's your name?
- Uh, I'm Ajabu.

03:16.075 --> 03:17.540
Pleased to meet you, Ajabu.

03:17.575 --> 03:22.950
- Come on out. I won't bite.
- Hmm. Okay.

03:22.985 --> 03:26.250
<i>Poa. I've never met anyone
that looks like you.</i>

03:26.291 --> 03:29.491
And I've met pretty
much everyone in the Pride Lands.

03:29.526 --> 03:31.791
Well, you see, I'm not from around here.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.330
I believe it.

03:33.365 --> 03:37.950
So Ajabu, are you a zebra?
Or a giraffe?

03:37.985 --> 03:40.580
Neither! I'm an okapi.

03:40.615 --> 03:43.450
<i>An okapi? Poa!</i>

03:43.485 --> 03:45.580
I've never met an okapi before.

03:45.615 --> 03:48.110
Well, there aren't many of us.
Even back home.

03:48.209 --> 03:49.909
How come you were hiding
in the bushes?

03:49.910 --> 03:53.370
- It's what I do.
- Hide in bushes?

03:53.411 --> 03:56.991
Oh, not just bushes. I hide
behind trees, behind rock piles...

03:57.026 --> 03:59.771
Oh, if I see a hole,
I'll hide in the hole.

03:59.869 --> 04:01.499
Why do you hide so much?

04:01.541 --> 04:05.451
Where I come from, it's the
smartest thing for an okapi to do.

04:05.486 --> 04:10.210
- Hey, Twiga.
- Morning, Beshte.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.790
Ajabu? Where'd you go?

04:15.825 --> 04:19.329
I'm here. Behind the rocks.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.790
Come back out!
That was just Twiga.

04:21.825 --> 04:24.790
She's a nice giraffe.
No need to hide from her.

04:24.825 --> 04:27.750
Back where I come from,
you can't be too careful.

04:27.785 --> 04:29.210
Where do you come from?

04:29.251 --> 04:33.371
A place far away with lots
of bushes and plenty of trees,

04:33.406 --> 04:36.659
a fair amount of rock piles.
A hole or two.

04:36.660 --> 04:40.330
- Lots of places to hide.
- So why'd you leave?

04:40.365 --> 04:45.410
Oh, I got chased out.
Guess I didn't hide well enough.

04:45.445 --> 04:47.869
- Who chased you out?
- A leopard.

04:47.904 --> 04:50.289
Okapis are a leopard's
favorite food.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.751
Well, you've got nothing
to hide from here.

04:52.786 --> 04:55.561
We don't have any leopards
in the Pride Lands.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.040
- Really?
- Hippo's honor!

04:58.075 --> 05:00.660
Then you think
I could stop hiding?

05:00.695 --> 05:02.910
Well, sure.
Come on, Ajabu.

05:02.945 --> 05:06.000

06:54.865 --> 06:58.330
Maybe it has something
to do with your smell.

06:58.365 --> 07:02.210
It is unmistakable, isn't it?

07:02.245 --> 07:04.790
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.040
Now to find Ono,
Beshte and Kion.

07:08.075 --> 07:11.330
Oh, and speaking of Kion,

07:11.365 --> 07:14.290
here's a nice fresh set
of his tracks!

07:14.325 --> 07:15.790
Right behind ya, Fuli!

07:22.999 --> 07:24.869
What you got, Fuli?

07:24.904 --> 07:27.409
Look. These aren't
Kion's tracks.

07:27.451 --> 07:31.451
Unless he's got one foot
bigger than the others.

07:31.486 --> 07:33.441
Nah, I don't think so.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.440
Kion! Beshte!
Ono! Game's over!

07:36.539 --> 07:37.949
You guys need to see this!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.290
On my way!

07:43.580 --> 07:46.410
Fuli! What is it?
You find something?

07:46.450 --> 07:50.790
Any idea what kind of animal
makes tracks like that?

07:50.825 --> 07:54.370
<i>Heyvi kabisa!
These are leopard tracks!</i>

07:54.405 --> 07:55.620
That's what I thought, too.

07:55.655 --> 07:58.040
Leopard tracks?
You sure?

07:58.080 --> 08:00.990
But there aren't any leopards
living in the Pride Lands.

08:01.025 --> 08:02.710
Well, there's one now.

08:02.745 --> 08:07.910
- The question is, where? Ono?
- I'm on it!

08:07.951 --> 08:10.581
Any chance it's just a
hyrax with really big feet?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.210
<i>Hapana!</i>

08:21.245 --> 08:24.090
Everyone! Everyone!
I saw the leopard!

08:24.289 --> 08:26.159
He's going after some gazelles!

08:26.160 --> 08:29.540
Lead the way, Ono.
Till the Pride Lands' end...

08:29.575 --> 08:31.410
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

08:37.909 --> 08:41.250
Get out of the Pride Lands,
leopard! Now!

08:41.284 --> 08:43.750
Name's Makucha, lion.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.450
You want me to go, you're
gonna have to make me.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.690
But you'll have to catch me first!

08:48.789 --> 08:51.329
<i>No problem! Huwezi!</i>

08:59.369 --> 09:01.539
You got nowhere
to go now!

09:01.540 --> 09:03.000
That's what
you think, cheetah!

09:12.829 --> 09:15.449
Wow! He sure can jump!

09:15.450 --> 09:17.210
Pretty fast, too.

09:17.245 --> 09:19.500
This guy's not gonna
be easy to catch.

09:19.535 --> 09:20.790
Did you see the gazelles?

09:20.825 --> 09:22.620
They weren't scared
of the leopard at all.

09:22.660 --> 09:25.580
That's why we've got to get
him out of the Pride Lands.

09:25.615 --> 09:28.080
None of the herds know
that leopards are hunters.

09:28.115 --> 09:31.210
So, they don't realize
they should be scared.

09:31.245 --> 09:32.830
They're all going to be
sitting ducks!

09:32.865 --> 09:34.500
Especially the ducks.

09:34.535 --> 09:36.190
That's why we gotta find him.

09:36.289 --> 09:39.079
Now let's split up so
we can cover more ground.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.160
Fuli, you're with me.
Bunga, you Ono and...

09:43.195 --> 09:45.120
Hey, where is Beshte?

09:45.155 --> 09:46.580
I bet he's still hiding.

09:46.615 --> 09:48.560
Don't worry, Kion.
We'll find him.

09:48.659 --> 09:51.409
Yeah. Let's go, Ono!

09:51.410 --> 09:53.710
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

09:53.745 --> 09:55.870
You're right, Beshte.

09:55.905 --> 09:58.750
The Pride Lands really
do seem great.

09:58.785 --> 10:00.560
See? What did I tell ya?

10:00.659 --> 10:02.789
There's plenty to eat,
and no need to hide.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.500
- You could...
- Beshte!

10:04.541 --> 10:07.621
Here you are! We've been
looking everywhere for you.

10:07.656 --> 10:13.000
- Ono! Found him!
- Actually, I think I saw him first.

10:13.099 --> 10:15.709
Maybe, but I got here first.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.885
- Fine.
- Hi, guys.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.581
I've been giving my new pal
Ajabu a tour of the Pride Lands.

10:21.616 --> 10:23.901
What new pal
are you talking about?

10:23.999 --> 10:28.160
This one here! Aja...
Huh? He was here a second ago.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.000
Ajabu? Ajabu!

10:32.621 --> 10:35.621
What's this Ajabu look like?
Maybe I've seen him around.

10:35.656 --> 10:38.751
Probably not.
He's new to the Pride Lands.

10:38.850 --> 10:40.620
I think I'm the only one
who's seen him.

10:40.655 --> 10:42.750
I didn't see him.
I only saw you.

10:42.785 --> 10:44.210
So what's he look like?

10:44.245 --> 10:48.120
Well... His top half
looks like a giraffe,

10:48.155 --> 10:50.330
his bottom half
looks like zebra,

10:50.365 --> 10:53.500
and his face kind of
looks like an oryx

10:53.535 --> 10:55.210
but without the horns.

10:55.245 --> 10:57.620
Sounds different.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.900
Is that one new pal
or three new pals?

10:59.999 --> 11:02.909
Just one. He's a nice guy.
You'd like him.

11:02.910 --> 11:05.710
And you're the only one
who can see him?

11:05.745 --> 11:10.250
No, no. I'm just the only one
who has seen him.

11:10.285 --> 11:11.750
Uh, Beshte?

11:11.790 --> 11:14.410
Maybe you've been hiding
all alone a little too long.

11:14.445 --> 11:17.080
No, seriously,
he was right here.

11:17.115 --> 11:20.620
Sure he was, Big B!
But we gotta go now.

11:20.655 --> 11:23.580
The Lion Guard
needs us. Right Ono?

11:23.615 --> 11:25.620
Affirmative. Follow me!

11:35.659 --> 11:37.829
Beshte. Glad they could find you.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.500
Sorry about that.
What's the kerbubble?

11:40.535 --> 11:42.160
There's a leopard
in the Pride Lands.

11:42.195 --> 11:44.790
A leopard?
Are you sure?

11:44.825 --> 11:48.830
- Yeah, we chased him, but he got away.
- This is terrible!

11:48.929 --> 11:51.249
I'm pretty sure
we can handle one leopard.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.710
You don't understand.

11:52.751 --> 11:56.251
I told Ajabu there aren't any
leopards in the Pride Lands.

11:56.286 --> 11:58.061
- Who's Ajabu?
- My new friend.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.520
I think your new friend's safe, Beshte.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.659
The leopard will be
going after real animals.

12:03.660 --> 12:07.250
- Ajabu is real!
- And is he here right now?

12:07.285 --> 12:11.790
Of course not!
Least, I don't think so.

12:11.825 --> 12:13.370
Unless he's hiding.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.710
Ajabu? Ajabu!

12:18.410 --> 12:21.620
- What's going on?
- Beshte has an imaginary friend.

12:21.655 --> 12:23.250
He's not imaginary!

12:23.285 --> 12:25.270
He looked pretty imaginary to us.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.209
You didn't even see him.

12:27.251 --> 12:30.081
Guys! We don't have time to
talk about this right now.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.691
Kion's right. We've got
a leopard on the loose.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.830
And it's up to us to catch him.

12:34.865 --> 12:36.834
Right. You got it, Kion!

12:36.869 --> 12:40.119
Now, let's go!

12:46.910 --> 12:50.700
More leopard tracks. Makucha
definitely came this way.

12:50.735 --> 12:54.660
Yup! Looks like we're on
the right "track." Get it?

12:54.695 --> 12:57.540
Get what?
We are on the right track.

12:57.575 --> 13:00.250
This is a track
and it's the right one.

13:00.285 --> 13:03.870
- It was kinda funny, right?
- Well...

13:03.905 --> 13:07.710
- The leopard's headed this way.
- Yeah. But it's hard to tell

13:07.751 --> 13:10.621
which way he went after
he got into the tall grass.

13:11.209 --> 13:12.789
Hey! I see him!

13:12.824 --> 13:15.039
- There he goes!
- Come on!

13:15.040 --> 13:16.750
How come I didn't see him?

13:16.785 --> 13:20.150
- I think he went this way.
- I still don't see him.

13:27.950 --> 13:29.410
<i>Hapana!</i>

13:37.160 --> 13:40.870
I could've sworn
I saw him run this way.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.040
You sure it was the leopard?

13:42.075 --> 13:44.910
The leopard?
No, I thought I saw Ajabu.

13:44.945 --> 13:47.210
Who?

13:47.245 --> 13:51.370
Hang on. We've been chasing
your imaginary friend?

13:51.405 --> 13:53.120
He's not imaginary!

13:53.155 --> 13:56.750
Big B? You know none of us
have seen him, right?

13:57.540 --> 14:01.584
- It's true.
- But guys. He really is real.

14:01.619 --> 14:03.592
- Why don't you believe me?
- I don't know.

14:03.627 --> 14:06.041
Maybe because your
half-zebra half-giraffe friend

14:06.076 --> 14:08.501
sounds so un-Bunga-lievable!

14:11.789 --> 14:14.999
Bunga, you really hurt his feelings.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.870
Why don't you two believe him?

14:16.911 --> 14:18.791
You heard what the guy's
supposed to look like.

14:18.826 --> 14:21.661
Half zebra, half giraffe, half oryx.

14:21.696 --> 14:23.000
And we didn't see him,

14:23.035 --> 14:25.290
even when Beshte said
he was right there.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.909
Do you believe him?

14:26.910 --> 14:29.870
I do. Beshte doesn't
make things up.

14:29.905 --> 14:32.750
Besides, did you hear him
say his new friend

14:32.785 --> 14:35.754
- was chased here by a leopard?
- Yeah, so?

14:35.789 --> 14:38.449
So we have a strange animal

14:38.450 --> 14:41.660
who says he was chased here
by a leopard.

14:41.695 --> 14:43.450
And we have a leopard!

14:43.485 --> 14:47.540
When you put it that way,
it does sound real.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.964
I didn't mean to hurt his feelings.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.750
- We should go say we're sorry.
- Good idea.

14:55.870 --> 14:59.080
Hey, Big B?
Don't be mad.

14:59.115 --> 15:02.080
We're sorry we didn't believe
your friend was real.

15:02.115 --> 15:06.160
He just sounded made-up.
Sorry.

15:06.195 --> 15:08.210
That's okay.

15:08.245 --> 15:10.910
He does look different
from anyone I've ever seen.

15:10.945 --> 15:12.870
I might not have
believed me, either.

15:12.905 --> 15:14.749
So we're pals again?

15:14.750 --> 15:16.710
We always were,
Little B.

15:16.751 --> 15:20.411
Okay, guys. Don't forget, we
still have a leopard at large.

15:20.446 --> 15:22.911
And if we believe
in Beshte's friend,

15:22.950 --> 15:25.830
we've got to believe that
the leopard's looking for him.

15:25.865 --> 15:28.330
That's right! So we've got to
find him first!

15:29.660 --> 15:31.950
Beshte! Wait for us!

15:39.500 --> 15:42.830
Well, Beshte did say
the Pride Lands were safe.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.210
Oh, hello, there.

15:47.245 --> 15:50.004
Hi. Nice to meet ya.

15:50.039 --> 15:52.619
Oh, nice stripes.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.580
Hello.

15:58.620 --> 16:02.120
Not to get personal,
stranger, but are you a zebra?

16:02.155 --> 16:08.040
- Uh, no. I'm not.
- I knew it!

16:08.075 --> 16:09.660
You're not a zebra!

16:11.615 --> 16:13.914
Look who's here.

16:13.949 --> 16:16.119
I know that. I said I'm not.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.580
Well, what are you then?
Are you a short giraffe?

16:20.615 --> 16:25.000
- No. I'm a...
- Are you a fancy antelope?

16:25.035 --> 16:28.870
- No! I'm a...
- Shh, shh! Wait, don't tell me.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.040
You're a...
You're a... Hmm.

16:31.660 --> 16:35.210
- Leopard!
- Leopard? What's that?

16:35.245 --> 16:37.910
Something big and mean
with sharp teeth!

16:37.945 --> 16:42.790
- And it's coming this way!
- Mmm-hmm. So it is.

16:42.825 --> 16:46.000
Well, in that case, my advice is...

16:46.035 --> 16:48.500
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

16:48.535 --> 16:51.410
Panic and run!

16:51.445 --> 16:53.870
The leopard! Come on!

16:53.911 --> 16:59.541
Makucha! I... I can't believe
you chased me all this way!

16:59.576 --> 17:01.294
You okapis are rare.

17:01.329 --> 17:04.289
Once you find one,
you stay on its trail.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.869
And your trail is about
to come to an end.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.250
Panic and run!
Panic and...

17:13.039 --> 17:16.329
I know I'm delicious,
but don't eat me! Please!

17:18.075 --> 17:21.829
I'm after somebody
a lot tastier than you.

17:23.289 --> 17:27.709
Well! I've never been
so insulted in all my life.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.330
Till the Pride Lands' end...

17:30.365 --> 17:32.950
<i>Lion Guard Defend!</i>

17:32.985 --> 17:35.080
Ugh! Not these guys again.

17:38.209 --> 17:41.659
Somebody tastier than me...
I mean, really?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.040
Anybody else think it's weird

17:46.075 --> 17:48.830
that the leopard didn't go
after any of the zebras?

17:48.865 --> 17:50.504
Yeah, now that you
mention it.

17:50.539 --> 17:54.289
I bet Ajabu
was hiding in the herd!

17:54.331 --> 17:57.081
Remember I said his back half
is striped like a zebra's?

17:57.116 --> 17:58.871
He'd blend right in.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.160
So you think the leopard
was after your new pal?

18:01.195 --> 18:03.540
He did say leopards
chase okapis all the time

18:03.575 --> 18:04.950
where he came from.

18:04.985 --> 18:06.910
Well, they're in
the Pride Lands now.

18:06.945 --> 18:11.040
And the Lion Guard
is gonna keep Ajabu safe!

18:11.075 --> 18:14.000
Thanks. I knew he could
count on you guys.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.120
What is that thing?

18:17.155 --> 18:18.710
That's Ajabu!

18:18.745 --> 18:21.580
Well, I'll be
a baboon's brother!

18:21.615 --> 18:23.450
Ajabu's actually real?

18:23.485 --> 18:25.044
You said you believed me.

18:25.079 --> 18:28.249
We did, but now
we really believe you.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.661
Anyway, I'm glad
you've finally seen him.

18:31.696 --> 18:34.001
Uh-oh! So has the leopard!

18:35.079 --> 18:38.079
Lion Guard, let's go!

18:38.114 --> 18:42.249
Leave me alone, Makucha!
Just go back home, won't you?

18:42.250 --> 18:46.000
No way! I've chased you
too far to give up now.

18:50.119 --> 18:52.499
<i>Poa! Nice move, Ajabu!</i>

18:54.210 --> 18:56.580
Now you're just
making me mad!

18:59.909 --> 19:01.369
I've got you now!

19:01.404 --> 19:04.449
<i>Not on my watch!
Twende Kiboko!</i>

19:07.500 --> 19:09.160
- Wow!
- You okay, Ajabu?

19:09.195 --> 19:10.710
I'm fine!

19:14.079 --> 19:16.289
Why don't you mind
your own business?

19:16.290 --> 19:19.120
I'm just saying hello
to an old friend.

19:19.155 --> 19:21.040
This is our business.

19:21.075 --> 19:23.250
And you're not acting too friendly.

19:23.285 --> 19:28.159
So leopards say hello
with their teeth, so what?

19:28.160 --> 19:31.250
So it's time for you to say goodbye!

19:31.285 --> 19:33.620
Come on!
I can fight two at once!

19:35.325 --> 19:38.307
Let's make it three!
What's the matter?

19:38.342 --> 19:41.289
Honey badger got your tail?

19:41.290 --> 19:43.790
Ugh! I hope you taste
better than you smell.

19:43.825 --> 19:45.080
Incoming!

19:48.538 --> 19:53.290
- You guys are amazing!
- Thanks. Now you stay here.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.660
I'll be right back!

20:02.654 --> 20:05.329
Fine! Have it your way!

20:05.330 --> 20:07.410
Not even an okapi
is worth this.

20:07.445 --> 20:09.250
Whoa!

20:09.285 --> 20:12.000
Don't stop till you're
out of the Pride Lands!

20:12.035 --> 20:13.722
Bunga, let go!

20:13.757 --> 20:15.409
Good idea!

20:15.410 --> 20:17.330
Whoa!

20:17.365 --> 20:19.620
And don't come back!

20:22.450 --> 20:25.750
Guess I told him.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.700
Hey, everybody, I've got
someone I want you to meet.

20:28.735 --> 20:32.250
Kion, Fuli, Bunga, Ono...

20:32.285 --> 20:34.290
This is my
new friend Ajabu.

20:34.325 --> 20:35.580
Hello.
Hi.

20:35.615 --> 20:38.210
Ajabu, meet the Lion Guard.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.160
Hi, everyone. I don't know
how to thank you for saving me.

20:42.195 --> 20:43.290
It's what we do.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.410
Are you a honey badger?

20:49.445 --> 20:51.370
I sure am!

20:51.405 --> 20:54.160
Wow! I've heard of honey badgers,

20:54.195 --> 20:59.410
- but I never believed they were real.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?

20:59.450 --> 21:02.370
I figured nobody could
look and smell like that.

21:02.405 --> 21:05.830
I thought they had to be
made up. But you're real!

21:05.865 --> 21:09.250
Yep! I'm as real as it gets!

21:09.285 --> 21:11.950
You're not planning on
going back home, are you?

21:11.985 --> 21:14.210
That leopard will be
waiting for you.

21:14.245 --> 21:17.910
- What else am I gonna do?
- I think I've got an idea.

21:18.830 --> 21:23.250
Mom, Dad? Ajabu came to the
Pride Lands as a visitor,

21:23.285 --> 21:26.869
but he'd really like to stay.
If he has your blessing.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.330
Of course, Ajabu.

21:29.365 --> 21:31.410
You're welcome to stay
in the Pride Lands.

21:31.445 --> 21:33.290
For as long as you like.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.210
Oh, thank you, Your Highness!
Thank you!

21:36.245 --> 21:38.500
We're happy to have you here, Ajabu.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.290
Welcome to the Pride Lands!

21:44.750 --> 21:47.950
So Ajabu. Now that
you're a Pride Lander,

21:47.985 --> 21:50.789
- what do you want to do next?
- Ha! I know!

21:50.824 --> 21:52.289
Let's play some more
hide-and-seek!

21:52.290 --> 21:54.330
Okay.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.540
Un-Bunga-lievable!
He's really good at that!
