00:04.280 --> 00:06.589
When did tick-tack-toe
become the pound sign?

00:06.760 --> 00:07.954
Why not call it what it is?

00:08.119 --> 00:11.635
"Leave your numeric message now,
and then press Archie's head."

00:12.320 --> 00:14.515
And what is that redial button?
Let's face it.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.638
You'll either get the person, the
machine or they have call waiting.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.677
Who is redialling and redialling?

00:19.840 --> 00:22.912
This is like the harassment key
for people in a fight, you know.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.310
Hey, I'm not through.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.235
You can't do that to me.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.391
And another thing.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.471
Who would win a fight
between you and me?

00:37.640 --> 00:38.834
What do you mean?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.639
If you and I ever got into
a really serious fight, you know...

00:41.800 --> 00:43.950
...and the punches started flying,
who would win?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.949
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.032
Yeah, me too.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.914
-Hey, Elaine.
-Hey.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.150
Who do you think would win
a fight between me...

00:55.320 --> 00:57.390
...and gorgeous George here?

00:57.560 --> 01:01.075
-You mean a real "fight" fight?
-Mano a baldo.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.473
George.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.840
-Why?
-George fights dirty.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.228
Really? What would you do?

01:08.400 --> 01:12.598
Pull hair, poke eyes, groin stuff.
Whatever I gotta do.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.996
So listen, you're not doing
anything tomorrow, are you?

01:17.160 --> 01:22.029
Because I have an extra ticket to the
historical clothing exhibit at the Met.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.952
I'm sorry.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.509
George?

01:26.680 --> 01:29.877
Would I want to see what
Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.792
There's nobody I can go with.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.959
You know what?
I don't have one female friend left.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.317
Well, no, of course, you don't.
You're a man's woman.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.516
You hate other women
and they hate you.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.874
Thank you.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.429
So, Jerry, what time
are we going to the movies?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.398
-How about the 8;30?
-Saddle up and ride.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.677
-You wanna get something to eat first?
-No, I'm good.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.154
I wonder if Susan--?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.472
No, I better just go.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.074
All right. See you.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.233
There's nothing more pathetic than
a grown man who's afraid of a woman.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.747
Hey, why don't you ask Susan?

02:10.919 --> 02:12.433
-George's Susan?
-Yeah.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.990
Yeah, why not Susan?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.593
I should be friends with Susan.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.194
Of course, Susan.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.509
Okay. I'll see you guys. Bye.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.954
That's gonna be trouble.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.871
-Why?
-Jerry, don't you see?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.918
This world here,
this is George's sanctuary.

02:33.080 --> 02:37.232
If Susan comes into contact
with this world, his worlds collide.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.434
You know what happens then?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.752
Did I tell you I'm getting
a new number?

02:47.920 --> 02:50.036
-How come?
-Chicks, man.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.111
Too many chicks know my number.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.236
Hey, Jerry, how are you,
Mr. Backstroke?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.755
Kramer, this is Ramon
from the new health club I joined.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.239
-You know what happened?
-What?

03:01.560 --> 03:02.754
They fired me.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.239
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.311
Said I put too much chlorine
in the pool.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.030
-Hey, well, stay out of the deep end.
-Okay. See you later.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.916
What's in the deep end?

03:17.160 --> 03:18.479
-Hello.
-Hey, George.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.551
-Hey, Laney, what's going on?
-Nothing much.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.948
Can I talk to Susan?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.231
Yeah, right. Hang on.
I'll get her for you.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.277
Seriously, what's up?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.708
No, George, really,
can I talk to Susan?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.229
Susan, why?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.278
Because I wanna ask her to lunch
and to the Met tomorrow.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.908
Oh, I don't think you wanna do that.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.879
-Why not?
-Well, what would be the point of that?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.394
Will you put her on the phone?

03:44.560 --> 03:46.630
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.870
Are you gonna let me
talk to Susan or not?

03:49.040 --> 03:52.271
I really think I should have
been consulted about this.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.594
Here. Something.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.110
Hello?

04:00.280 --> 04:03.875
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh, I love that sort of stuff.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.028
-You wanna sit here?
-Yeah.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.434
Over there.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.439
-Why?
-A little buffer zone.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.269
If we were at my place on the couch,
would we sit right next to each other?

04:16.440 --> 04:18.317
-No, you got a point.
-All right.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.952
I can't.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.512
-What are you doing?
-Well, these seats have no lumbar.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.073
Oh, hey, there's Ramon.
Pretend we're talking.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.477
-We are talking.
-Pretend it's interesting.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.311
So, well, then I had to kill him
and the police are still looking for me.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.516
-Yeah, that's....
-Hey, hi, Jerry.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.398
-Hey, Ramon.
-I took a lot of napkins.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.879
-You want some?
-Oh, no, thanks.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.359
Hey, is this seat taken?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.999
No.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.840
And the worst part is, after the movie
he leeched onto us...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.230
...we wound up having
coffee with him for two hours.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.960
Then he walks us home, all the way
back to the building.

05:00.120 --> 05:03.271
Finally, I said, "Look, Ramon,
I gotta go to bed now."

05:04.840 --> 05:07.832
-Have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
-No, why?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.479
She called Susan last night.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.312
Oh, yeah, I know.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.153
-How do you know?
-lt was my idea.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.718
-Your idea?
-Yeah?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.029
What'd you do that for?

05:18.720 --> 05:21.075
She was looking for someone
to go to the show with.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.914
Well, that was really a stupid thing.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.594
-You know what's gonna happen now?
-Worlds collide.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.518
Yeah.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.272
Because this world is
your sanctuary...

05:32.440 --> 05:35.750
-...and if it comes in contact with this--
-Yes, it blows up.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.717
If you know,
what did you tell Elaine for?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.871
I didn't know. Kramer told me
about the worlds.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.634
You couldn't figure out
the worlds theory for yourself?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.279
It's just common sense.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.194
Anybody knows
you gotta keep your worlds apart.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.998
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.428
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.158
He knows the worlds theory.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.117
What? Is it blowing up?

06:01.120 --> 06:02.678
Cosmo, go.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.513
No, no, no, no.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.236
This new telephone number
is driving me crazy.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.118
Wrong numbers every five minutes.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.397
-What is it?
-Well, it's 555-3455.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.872
-555-3455.
-Yeah.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.799
555-3455.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.396
Well, wait a second.
Don't you see? That's 555-FlLK.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.152
-What's "filk"?
-Filk's nothing.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.118
But 555-FlLM is Moviefone.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.633
Oh, Moviefone.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.792
Yeah, so people are just dialling it
by mistake and getting you.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.636
-So I'm filk.
-You're filk.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.631
Oh, Mama.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.834
Well, but what about that number
Susan B. Anthony wore...

06:44.000 --> 06:45.956
...to the 19th Amendment party, huh?

06:47.200 --> 06:50.829
Quite the dÃ©colletage
for a suffragette.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.037
Well, it must have been
one hell of a party.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.952
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.519
What?

06:58.560 --> 06:59.754
Forget it.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.832
What? You can tell me.
I'll put it in the vault.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.592
The vault?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.957
Mr. Seinfeld, we heard
you went to the movies with Ramon.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.270
I didn't actually go with Ramon.
I bumped into him.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.556
It's good he has friends
like you to cheer him up.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.234
-Tell him to call us.
-Tell him Dustin says hello.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.231
-All right. I gotta go.
-To see Ramon?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.308
What else did you two do?

07:26.480 --> 07:28.914
Oh, I don't know.
You know, girlie stuff.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.513
So flower shows and shopping
for pretty bows....

07:32.680 --> 07:36.070
And then back to her place, strip down
to bra and panties for a tickle fight?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.997
That's what you think girls do,
isn't it?

07:45.480 --> 07:47.789
Yes, I do.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.798
Alrighty.

07:49.960 --> 07:54.158
Hey, you know, George isn't too happy
about your new friendship.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.595
Yeah, well, I don't really give a sh--

07:58.200 --> 08:00.270
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

08:02.560 --> 08:04.232
Yeah, hello.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.119
Yeah, no, no, no. Hold on.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.191
Yeah, Cupid's Rifle.
Eight-thirty, Sony Lincoln Square.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.113
Yeah, no, no, no.
No problem. Yeah.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.748
You're looking up movies
for people now?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.638
I got time.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.439
And this.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.238
Cosmo here.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.437
Yeah. No, no, no. I'll help.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.716
Yeah, Firestorm's good.
I saw it yesterday.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.597
My buddy Jerry,
he's seen it twice.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.193
You wanna talk to him?

08:37.360 --> 08:39.316
-Here.
-No, Kramer. I don't wanna talk to--

08:39.480 --> 08:42.916
Just tell him about the picture.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.310
Yes, are you still there?
Look, I'm sorry about that.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.631
All right, there's an 8;30
and a 10;15 showing.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.713
Oh, that's George. Yeah?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.233
Hey, it's Ramon.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.755
-What?
-It's Ramon, Jerry. I'm coming up.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.674
Oh, okay.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.239
What is he doing here?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.834
-Who? Who is Ramon?
-He's the pool guy.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.479
-What pool guy?
-Do me a favour.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.710
-Stick around while he's here.
-Yeah, no problem.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.269
Hey, Jerry, how are you, crazy guy?

09:09.560 --> 09:12.597
-So, Ramon, this is my friend Elaine.
-Yeah, and I was just leaving.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.552
Bye-bye, Jerry.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.640
-What are you doing around here?
-I was in the neighbourhood.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.519
-I figured I'd check you out.
-I kind of had some things to do.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.398
Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?

09:27.560 --> 09:30.393
Just, you know, I don't know.
Stuff I gotta do.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.393
Hey, that's cool.
I'm up for some stuff.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.598
All right.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.076
So get this. I get down there...

09:41.240 --> 09:44.152
...and right away
I see the drain is clogged.

09:44.320 --> 09:48.108
-It's obvious. Can you believe that?
-All right, Ramon. I'm gonna get going.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.677
-I think we should separate here.
-What are you trying to say, Jerry?

09:52.840 --> 09:55.798
Look. You're a nice guy,
but I actually only have three friends.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.234
I really can't handle any more.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.277
I see. It's because I clean pools,
right?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.670
That has nothing to do with it.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.757
Yeah, we got along real well.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.196
Because, you know,
she has no female friends.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.430
You know that, don't you?

10:12.600 --> 10:15.637
Something strange about a woman
whose friends are all men.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.236
Yeah, I know.
We talked all about that.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.356
-You talked all about that?
-Oh, yeah.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.398
Elaine opened up her vault.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.634
Did you just say "vault"?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.552
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.074
You got that from Elaine?

10:31.240 --> 10:33.629
Yeah. So what?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.711
Well, it's a little strange.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.713
Are you gonna start
to talk like Elaine from now on?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.074
I don't know.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.595
Anyway, I thought
we'd all go to a movie on Friday.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.751
We'd all go to a movie on Friday?

10:44.920 --> 10:46.239
Yeah.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.590
This is not good.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.228
Worlds are colliding.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.868
George is getting upset!

10:59.320 --> 11:02.357
You have no idea
of the magnitude of this thing.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.273
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...

11:05.440 --> 11:09.035
...then George Costanza,
as you know him, ceases to exist.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.110
You see, right now,
I have relationship George...

11:13.280 --> 11:16.875
...but there is also
independent George.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.793
That's the George you know,
the George you grew up with.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.431
Movie George, coffee-shop George,
liar George, bawdy George.

11:24.600 --> 11:29.435
-I love that George.
-Me too. And he's dying, Jerry.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.433
If relationship George
walks through this door...

11:32.600 --> 11:34.989
...he will kill independent George.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.113
A George divided against itself
cannot stand.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.198
You're killing independent George.
You know that, don't you?

11:47.360 --> 11:48.839
George, I don't even wanna get--

11:49.000 --> 11:52.436
You know what word Susan
used last night? "Vault."

11:52.600 --> 11:54.989
-So?
-She got that from you.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.752
Well, I didn't tell her to say it.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.798
Is she the only girl in the whole world?
Can't you find your own?

11:59.960 --> 12:01.518
I like her.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.478
You see? You see?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.756
You see what I'm talking about?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.390
It's all just slipping away.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.357
And you're all letting it happen.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.238
-So you wanna catch a movie later?
-Yeah, sure.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.314
I don't have a paper, though.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.434
Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.639
Brought to you by
The New York Times and Hot 97.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.030
Coming to theatres this Friday;

12:34.200 --> 12:36.475
Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.676
You've got to get me
over that mountain!

12:38.840 --> 12:40.990
No!

12:45.640 --> 12:50.668
There's no higher place
than Mountain High. Rated R.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.196
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.318
Kramer, is that you?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.871
Elaine?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.190
What time does Chow Fun start?

13:07.800 --> 13:09.438
I don't know.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.471
Well, well, look who's here.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.995
What are you doing here?
You could get in trouble.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.673
No, I don't think so, Jerry.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.512
You see, they gave me my job back.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.195
-What?
-I'm a pool boy again.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.716
Look, Ramon, about the other day,
I'm sorry if I offended you.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.472
I get a little crabby on the subway.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.914
Oh, do you?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.159
What happened to all the towels?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.838
I guess they must have
disappeared.

13:39.760 --> 13:44.390
Hey, Jerry, look at all the towels they
gave me. I really hit the jackpot.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.233
It's been a terrible situation down there
the past couple of days.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.516
He's really making things
uncomfortable for me.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.399
There's always a big pile
of dirty towels in front of my locker.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.869
Then when I come out of pool,
my towel is always gone.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.952
-So frustrating.
-Tell me about it.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.430
So you wanna join me and Susan
for lunch at the coffee shop?

14:04.600 --> 14:07.319
-You're meeting at the coffee shop?
-Yeah.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.550
I'm meeting George
for lunch at the coffee shop.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.758
Well, this should be very interesting.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.196
-Hey, Elaine, Jerry. Over here.
-Oh, there they are.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.554
-Look who I ran into.
-Great.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.314
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.952
Come on. Aren't you gonna
join us?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.759
You know, I'm supposed to meet...

14:31.920 --> 14:33.069
...someone.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.959
-I'll wait for him outside.
-Wait here. Come on, sit down.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.111
What's the matter with you?

14:38.560 --> 14:40.915
This is gonna be ugly.

14:41.360 --> 14:46.070
-What's that, Jerry?
-I said, boy, am I ugly.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.716
Hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.

One, two...

15:05.880 --> 15:07.393
...three...

15:08.920 --> 15:10.194
...four.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.155
-Hey, George!
-No, we'll pull up another chair.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.311
I see you there, Ramon.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.153
Hey, I'm not done.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.709
I know what you're up to, Ramon.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.711
Because I'm a member here,
this is my place to swim.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.553
Now, you better cut it out, Ramon.
Just stop it.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.153
Ollie, ollie, oxen free!

15:57.720 --> 15:59.631
No!

16:05.120 --> 16:08.590
I think he's gonna need
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.828
Mouth-to-mouth?

16:12.280 --> 16:13.474
Yeah.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.988
Well...

16:20.040 --> 16:21.155
...go ahead.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.038
You go.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.197
You knocked him out.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.713
Yeah, but you pulled him in.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.713
Come on, Newman. Do it.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.119
No.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.357
He might die.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.272
Yeah. Maybe.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.671
Jerry, we'll meet you
at the theatre. Okay.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.910
Next showing's at 9;00.
We can't wait any longer.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.548
Where could he be?
It's not like George to just disappear.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.631
Look, let's just leave him
a note, okay?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.358
-I don't know.
-Oh, come on. Come on.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.919
"George.

16:55.080 --> 17:00.632
Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel...

17:00.800 --> 17:02.199
...with Jerry."

17:02.960 --> 17:04.279
-"Love"?
-Yeah.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.907
"Love, Susan."

17:07.520 --> 17:09.351
So eventually these people came...

17:09.520 --> 17:11.556
...and somebody gave him
mouth-to-mouth.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.073
He could have died.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.919
Yeah, it was a gamble.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.718
Why didn't you give him
mouth-to-mouth?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.279
How can you possibly
show your face there again?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.112
Oh, I can't.
They revoked my membership.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.238
Newman too. No, we can't go
anywhere near there.

17:27.400 --> 17:33.236
Hi. Three for Chunnel.
Two adults, one child.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.392
What the hell is this?

17:35.560 --> 17:39.394
"George. Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel with Jerry."

17:40.440 --> 17:43.910
With Jerry, huh? With Jerry.
Great. Great.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.430
Probably went to the 84th Street.
That's where I always go with Jerry.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.238

18:50.520 --> 18:52.750
Loews Paragon,
84th and Broadway.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.072
Chunnel is playing at the Paragon
84th Street cinema...

18:57.240 --> 19:00.073
...in the main theatre at 9;30 p.m.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.959
Yeah, now I got you.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.398
It's also playing
in theatre number two at 9;00.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.952
-The English Channel Tunnel...
-Jerry.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.190
-...or Chunnel runs 32--
-Where are you?

19:14.360 --> 19:15.395
With two openings.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.358
-One here. And another here.
-I know you like to sit back here.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.912
-That's all we've got. Thank you--
-Elaine?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.071
-Can I ask you something?
-Susan?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.796
I can't figure out
what's going on here.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.712
I can't follow the plot.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.154
Why did they kill that guy?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.390
-I thought he was with them.
-That's not the guy.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.278
That's a different guy.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.873
What is he doing in the Chunnel?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.235
Would you two please...?

19:39.400 --> 19:43.313
Everybody out of the Chunnel!
Everybody out of the Chunnel!

19:46.520 --> 19:49.318
Susan, Jerry.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.789
Where are you?
I know you're there.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.393
-Answer me.
-Hey, sit down.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.030
Hey, hey, answer me!
Come on, show yourselves.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.988
-We're trying to watch a movie here.
-Drink your soda.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.799
Come on. I know you're there,
laughing at me.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.394
Laughing and lying and laughing.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.120
I had to go to Reggie's, Jerry.
Reggie's.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.392
-You better stay off of there.
-Where are you?

20:12.560 --> 20:14.391
Hey, are you sure you got
the right theatre?

20:14.560 --> 20:18.348
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, Chunnel. Susan!
-It's playing in two theatres.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.709
-Two theatres?
-Yeah, there's a 9 too.

20:24.040 --> 20:28.431
Your car is in the Chunnel,
somewhere between France--

20:28.600 --> 20:30.079
Sorry.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.636
-Good, huh?
-What'd you think, Susan?

20:34.800 --> 20:36.438
I don't know.
I couldn't hear anything.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.989
-You two talked the whole movie.
-Oh, well, come on.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.038
-You wanna go grab a bite to eat?
-No, I don't think so.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.713
-Why not?
-Well, you know...

20:43.880 --> 20:46.678
...all you guys ever do is sit around
the coffee shop talking...

20:46.840 --> 20:48.558
...sit around Jerry's apartment
talking.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.750
Frankly, I don't know
how you can stand it.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.429
See you.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.397
I know they're in there.
The three of them.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.030
Laughing at me, together.
Laughing and lying.

20:59.720 --> 21:03.315
They're killing independent George!
They're all in on it!

21:03.480 --> 21:04.993
Worlds are colliding!

21:17.080 --> 21:19.753
Hello, and welcome
to your worst nightmare.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.833
I know you're in there.
Cosmo Kramer, apartment 5B.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.036
You're in big trouble now.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.952
You've been stealing my business.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.317
If you'd like to do this the easy way,
open the door now.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.278
