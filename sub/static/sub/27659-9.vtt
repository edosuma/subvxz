WEBVTT

00:00.746 --> 00:02.001
Sir, you wanted to see me?

00:02.003 --> 00:03.495
Yes,
I have an assignment for you.

00:03.539 --> 00:04.757
I'm afraid it's not
a pleasant one.

00:04.801 --> 00:06.542
Oh, my God.
Please tell me it's not...

00:06.585 --> 00:09.022
Yes, it's Hitchcock related.

00:09.066 --> 00:10.372
Son of a bitch.

00:10.415 --> 00:13.157
Detective Hitchcock is set to
testify in court this afternoon.

00:13.201 --> 00:16.465
It's an important case, and I'd rather
not get another call from the DA

00:16.508 --> 00:19.424
saying he showed up
"covered in condiments."

00:19.468 --> 00:21.201
So you want me to
keep Hitchcock from

00:21.226 --> 00:23.254
spilling on himself for
the rest of the day?

00:23.298 --> 00:24.560
We both know that's impossible.

00:24.603 --> 00:26.344
- I'm counting on you.
- I won't do it.

00:26.388 --> 00:28.955
- There's nobody else I trust.
- What you're asking is insane.

00:28.999 --> 00:31.393
- I'm not asking.
- It's a suicide mission!

00:31.436 --> 00:33.221
- Then prepare for death.
- You've lost your mind!

00:33.264 --> 00:35.658
This is a direct order,
Detective! Get in line!

00:35.701 --> 00:37.616
Hey.
You guys startled Hitchcock.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.532
He spilled two full jars
of spaghetti sauce on himself.

00:40.576 --> 00:42.015
Thanks a lot, fellas.

01:02.119 --> 01:04.339
Ames, super important question.

01:04.382 --> 01:05.949
Which one of these shirts
should I wear to dinner

01:05.992 --> 01:07.701
- with your mom tonight?
- Those are exactly the same.

01:07.725 --> 01:09.431
I have a signature look, Rosa.

01:09.474 --> 01:10.910
Put on a T-shirt for all I care.

01:10.954 --> 01:12.129
It doesn't matter what you wear.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.391
Of course it matters.

01:13.435 --> 01:14.914
He has to wear
the smaller checks.

01:14.958 --> 01:17.569
Big checks wash him out.
Where are you, Amy?

01:17.613 --> 01:20.050
It doesn't matter, because
the night is already ruined.

01:20.093 --> 01:23.271
My stupid mother invited my
stupid brother David to join us.

01:23.314 --> 01:25.708
- I thought you liked your brothers.
- I have seven brothers, Rosa,

01:25.751 --> 01:28.885
and I like all of them except David.
Perfect David.

01:28.928 --> 01:31.583
David graduated at the top of
his class at the police academy.

01:31.627 --> 01:34.584
David took a bullet for the mayor.
David bakes his own bread.

01:34.585 --> 01:36.414
Ooh, and does this David have a sister?

01:36.458 --> 01:38.633
- Yes. Amy is his sister.
- And what's her deal?

01:38.634 --> 01:40.485
You were at the wedding,
Hitchcock.

01:40.486 --> 01:41.593
I'm just gonna call and cancel.

01:41.637 --> 01:42.812
I really don't want
to have dinner with my mom

01:42.855 --> 01:44.596
fawning all over the golden boy.

01:44.597 --> 01:46.072
I'm sure
your mom loves you both equally.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.078
No, she definitely doesn't.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.513
My parents arrange
the photos of their kids

01:48.557 --> 01:50.036
by who makes them the proudest.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.951
Number one goes on the
mantel above the fireplace,

01:51.995 --> 01:53.475
two through four on the
piano, and the rest

01:53.518 --> 01:55.128
- are on the staircase.
- This is wack.

01:55.172 --> 01:56.782
- So David's on the mantel?
- Always.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.436
Meanwhile, my picture
gathers dust on the piano.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.872
The piano's not that bad.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.396
Nobody in the family even plays, Rosa.

02:01.439 --> 02:02.788
At least people use the stairs.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.790
All right, David is perfect,
but so are you.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.618
Let's just go tonight,
and I'll be your hype man.

02:06.662 --> 02:08.446
You know how good I am
at talking you up.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.708
Here, watch.
Hey, Scully.

02:09.752 --> 02:12.145
Did you know that Amy
is super cool?

02:12.189 --> 02:14.626
No way. Can I get
your autograph, ma'am?

02:14.670 --> 02:16.411
- See?
- Fine, we'll go.

02:16.454 --> 02:20.110
What, too stuck up for your fans?
Ya friggin' turd!

02:20.153 --> 02:22.939
Hey, Captain, Sarge, I have a case
I want to discuss with you.

02:22.982 --> 02:24.810
You want to talk about work
in the break room?

02:24.854 --> 02:27.335
That's highly unorthodox, but
I suppose we can give it a try.

02:27.378 --> 02:29.293
Okay, so I have a perp...

02:29.337 --> 02:31.339
I'm sorry, this is insane.
Let's talk in my office.

02:31.382 --> 02:32.905
Much better.
All right, Boyle,

02:32.949 --> 02:34.342
what's this case
you wanted to talk about?

02:34.385 --> 02:37.693
I have a perp, Alfonso Tucker,
transferring into our holding cell.

02:37.736 --> 02:39.825
The guy who was dealing
that toxic batch of meth?

02:39.869 --> 02:41.871
Yeah, and he refuses to name
his supplier.

02:41.914 --> 02:43.133
I want to send someone
into holding,

02:43.176 --> 02:44.482
undercover as a perp,

02:44.526 --> 02:47.050
- to see if they can get him to open up.
- Why don't you do it?

02:47.093 --> 02:48.834
You're always going on
about your acting abilities

02:48.878 --> 02:50.793
and that time you played Annie.

02:50.836 --> 02:53.491
I'm an adult man, Sarge.
I didn't play Annie.

02:53.535 --> 02:56.581
I was in "Annie."
I played Miss Hannigan.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.018
Unfortunately,
Alfonso knows I'm a cop,

02:59.062 --> 03:02.413
so I can't be Maxwell Blaze.

03:02.457 --> 03:04.459
But Terry might be right
for the role.

03:04.502 --> 03:05.982
Ooh, that sounds fun.

03:06.025 --> 03:08.419
I love flexing
my creative muscles.

03:08.463 --> 03:10.726
In addition to flexing
my actual muscles.

03:10.769 --> 03:13.555
- Or I could do it.
- What? You hate theater.

03:13.598 --> 03:15.948
You always say acting
is just professional lying.

03:15.992 --> 03:19.430
Yes, but this is what the mission
calls for, and I'm good at it.

03:19.474 --> 03:20.997
Kevin and I
went to a dinner party

03:21.040 --> 03:24.077
where we played the French
parlor game "charades."

03:24.080 --> 03:25.958
I had to act out Elvis Presley.

03:28.439 --> 03:31.181
He's dead now,
so I portrayed him as such.

03:31.224 --> 03:32.400
Everyone understood...

03:32.443 --> 03:33.531
Immediately.

03:33.575 --> 03:36.404
You know, a little competition might
bring out the best in both of you.

03:36.447 --> 03:40.408
We'll hold auditions this afternoon.
I'll prepare sides.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.235
Please wear clothes
you can move in.

03:42.279 --> 03:45.413
Okay, let's get to the table
before David gets here.

03:45.456 --> 03:46.762
My mother loves an early bird.

03:46.805 --> 03:48.416
Hey, babe, before we go in,

03:48.459 --> 03:50.505
I know I said I was gonna do
the whole hype man thing, but...

03:50.548 --> 03:53.812
I know. I shouldn't compare
myself to my brother.

03:53.856 --> 03:55.074
We're all on our own journey.

03:55.118 --> 03:56.554
What? No.
Who told you that garbage?

03:56.598 --> 03:57.729
I was gonna say,
we need a backup plan

03:57.773 --> 03:59.122
so you can win this thing.

03:59.165 --> 04:00.558
If it starts slipping away,
I'll pretend to choke,

04:00.602 --> 04:03.474
and then you give me the Heimlich
and save my life in front of everyone.

04:03.518 --> 04:05.911
Aw, thanks for not trying
to make me a better person.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.478
- I love you.
- Love you too.

04:07.522 --> 04:13.128
Amy, Jake! David and I
both arrived an hour early.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.958
We're sharing a French onion.

04:15.001 --> 04:16.264
Mother...

04:16.307 --> 04:18.221
So she's about to jump,
and I say,

04:18.266 --> 04:20.572
"Hey, I can't tell you
this world is a good place,

04:20.616 --> 04:22.748
but I guarantee you
it's better with you in it."

04:22.792 --> 04:24.272
And she climbs down
off the ledge,

04:24.315 --> 04:25.577
- and she gives me a big hug.
- Ugh.

04:25.621 --> 04:27.187
And that was
before she won the Oscar?

04:27.231 --> 04:28.754
I don't know, I don't
really follow pop culture.

04:28.798 --> 04:31.061
You never cease
to impress me, David.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.410
Hey, speaking of impressive,

04:32.454 --> 04:34.064
Amy just went
to the NYPD shooting range

04:34.107 --> 04:36.588
and received a gold
certification in marksmanship.

04:36.632 --> 04:38.198
Oh, I just got
the platinum certification.

04:38.242 --> 04:39.548
What? That exists?
What did you do,

04:39.591 --> 04:40.853
curve the bullets,
"Wanted" -style?

04:40.897 --> 04:43.291
Yeah, I don't know what "Wanted" is.
I don't follow pop culture.

04:43.334 --> 04:44.553
But I fired ten shots,

04:44.596 --> 04:45.597
and they all went
into the same hole.

04:45.641 --> 04:47.382
Oh, so you actually did.

04:47.425 --> 04:48.774
Hey, Camila,
did you know that Amy

04:48.818 --> 04:50.210
is the youngest female sergeant

04:50.254 --> 04:51.429
in the history of the Nine-Nine?

04:51.473 --> 04:53.170
Yes, I'm very proud of her.

04:53.213 --> 04:54.563
I'm proud of all my children.

04:54.606 --> 04:56.129
The sergeant and the lieutenant.

04:56.173 --> 04:58.741
What? You passed
the lieutenant's exam?

04:58.784 --> 05:00.656
It actually wasn't something
I was planning on taking,

05:00.699 --> 05:02.484
but then my partner got sick
and I wanted to be able

05:02.527 --> 05:04.050
to send home extra money
to his wife and kids.

05:04.094 --> 05:06.792
Then I read the MRI.
He was totally misdiagnosed.

05:06.836 --> 05:08.968
So long story short,
Bo is alive,

05:09.012 --> 05:11.144
and I got a perfect score
on the test for no reason.

05:11.188 --> 05:14.191
Oh, man. Hey, check out
these dinner rolls, huh?

05:14.234 --> 05:15.366
Love these bad boys.

05:15.410 --> 05:18.369
I'm just gonna chomp down
on that, recklessly.

05:20.371 --> 05:22.547
Oh! Oh, no, Jake!
He's choking!

05:22.591 --> 05:24.201
Let David do it.
He has EMT training.

05:24.244 --> 05:26.334
- I'm here for you, Jake.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

05:26.377 --> 05:27.770
You know what...

05:27.813 --> 05:29.162
Don't worry.
It is gonna hurt like hell.

05:29.206 --> 05:30.947
I think it's actually okay.

05:32.340 --> 05:35.343
Thank you both so much
for coming in.

05:35.386 --> 05:37.388
This is a safe space

05:37.432 --> 05:39.695
where choices are welcome.

05:39.738 --> 05:42.480
Okay, now, I trust that both of you
had a chance to review the script?

05:42.524 --> 05:44.482
- Yeah.
- Good. Now throw them away!

05:44.526 --> 05:46.571
What the hell?
I wrote notes in the margin.

05:46.615 --> 05:48.094
Terry found his super-objective.

05:48.138 --> 05:51.576
I want to see you improvise
without the safety net.

05:51.620 --> 05:54.536
I want to see you become
Maxwell Blaze.

05:54.579 --> 05:58.017
So, Maxwell,
what was your childhood like?

05:58.061 --> 06:00.019
I was a lookout at 8,

06:00.063 --> 06:01.238
had my own corner at 10,

06:01.281 --> 06:02.805
trigger man at 13.

06:02.848 --> 06:05.851
You know what it's like
to look a man in his eyes

06:05.895 --> 06:07.505
as the life drains out of him?

06:07.549 --> 06:09.464
I was bad from a young age.

06:09.507 --> 06:11.161
At school, I pushed people.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.860
And this wasn't horseplay.
This was pushing to hurt.

06:14.904 --> 06:16.427
Do you have a girlfriend
at home?

06:16.471 --> 06:18.429
Used to. She got tired
of me getting locked up.

06:18.473 --> 06:19.778
She's with my brother now.

06:19.822 --> 06:22.041
He better hope
I never find his ass.

06:22.085 --> 06:25.305
I do,
and you should see her heavy,

06:25.349 --> 06:26.742
feminine breasts,

06:26.785 --> 06:28.439
with their perfectly placed
nipples.

06:28.483 --> 06:30.093
Don't get me started on her can.

06:30.136 --> 06:32.661
- What's your greatest fear?
- I ain't scared of nothing.

06:32.704 --> 06:36.229
My girlfriend. I'm scared
she'll find out about my mistress,

06:36.273 --> 06:38.493
who also has a perfect can.

06:38.536 --> 06:41.017
It's smaller, but it's harder.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.453
Great.

06:42.497 --> 06:44.803
You both have given me
something totally different.

06:44.847 --> 06:47.371
I've got a lot to think about.

06:47.415 --> 06:49.112
Thank you.
Next!

06:49.155 --> 06:51.636
What up, dawgs?

06:51.680 --> 06:53.856
Norm Scully,
reading for Maxwell Blaze.

06:53.899 --> 06:56.728
Listen, I just did
what anyone would do.

06:56.772 --> 06:58.469
Hey, where'd you go?

06:58.513 --> 07:00.689
I just couldn't stand there
while the whole restaurant

07:00.732 --> 07:02.430
gushed over David
saving your life.

07:02.473 --> 07:03.866
Yeah, there was
a standing ovation.

07:03.909 --> 07:06.477
Also, everyone saw you
walk away while I was choking,

07:06.521 --> 07:07.739
and I don't want to say
you're a villain now,

07:07.783 --> 07:10.089
but the B-word
was tossed around a lot.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.656
Ugh.
I'm sorry.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.136
I just can't be around him.

07:13.179 --> 07:14.877
I shouldn't have come.
So let's leave.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.835
I'll tell everyone my stomach
hurts, which it does.

07:16.879 --> 07:18.794
I'm pretty sure he broke my rib
when he gave me the Heimlich.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.535
Lieutenant Santiago, a word?

07:20.578 --> 07:23.276
Why is David's captain here?

07:23.320 --> 07:25.627
What's going on?
Is there a maniac on the loose,

07:25.670 --> 07:26.845
and David's the only one
who can catch him

07:26.889 --> 07:28.107
before he blows up a train?

07:28.151 --> 07:29.718
Oh, we could call him
the Trainiac.

07:29.761 --> 07:31.284
We're focused
on the same things.

07:31.328 --> 07:33.243
Sorry, folks,
we've discovered a large quantity

07:33.286 --> 07:35.898
of cocaine in Lieutenant Santiago's desk.

07:35.941 --> 07:38.204
We've had to place
him under arrest.

07:38.248 --> 07:43.601
Oh, no.

07:44.442 --> 07:46.657
Of course.
We'll head over soon.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.093
So that was my brother.

07:48.136 --> 07:51.139
He needs me to
bail him out of jail.

07:51.183 --> 07:52.837
I feel so awful for him.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.186
You are smiling so much.

07:54.229 --> 07:56.449
No, no, I promise.
I feel so, so, bad.

07:56.493 --> 07:57.276
Rosa D!

07:57.319 --> 07:58.799
Deezer, what up?
Deezer?

07:58.843 --> 08:00.758
Hey, Scully, did you do
something new with your hair?

08:00.801 --> 08:02.455
Same thing as always:
Put mousse in it

08:02.499 --> 08:04.326
while it's wet,
then I watch a scary movie.

08:04.370 --> 08:06.503
- You the man.
- What is wrong with her?

08:06.546 --> 08:08.287
Her brother David got arrested.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.289
- He's a cokehead!
- And you're happy about this?

08:10.332 --> 08:12.073
That's savage.
I love it.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.598
- I'm not happy about it!
- All right. Calm down, Littlefinger.

08:14.641 --> 08:16.121
He's in a lot of trouble,
you know.

08:16.164 --> 08:17.731
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right.

08:17.775 --> 08:19.516
It's a terrible situation.

08:19.559 --> 08:21.387
- Let's go bail him out.
- All right.

08:21.431 --> 08:23.520
Ooh, should I get my hair
blown out first?

08:23.563 --> 08:26.610
I'm gonna have pictures from
today for the rest of my life.

08:26.653 --> 08:29.700
Are you...
a bad person?

08:29.868 --> 08:31.566
Casting's up!

08:31.609 --> 08:33.176
This is not
a high school play, Boyle.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.177
Just let us know
who you went with.

08:34.220 --> 08:35.221
Okay, first of all,

08:35.265 --> 08:36.788
I want to say that this was

08:36.832 --> 08:38.876
one of the hardest decisions
I've ever had to make.

08:38.921 --> 08:40.966
There is so much talent
in this room.

08:41.010 --> 08:42.489
Just tell us, bitch.

08:42.533 --> 08:43.751
Act as if you already have
the role.

08:43.794 --> 08:47.930
I could have cast any one of
you and put on a great show,

08:47.973 --> 08:49.105
but I had to make a call.

08:49.148 --> 08:50.846
Enough, Boyle.
We're all adults.

08:50.889 --> 08:52.630
No one cares about this
that much.

08:52.674 --> 08:54.197
- It's Captain Holt.
- Captain Holt?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.546
He was the worst one!

08:55.590 --> 08:58.288
No offense,
but Holt was so unconvincing.

08:58.331 --> 08:59.637
He kept referring
to his childhood

08:59.681 --> 09:01.421
as a soot-covered street urchin.

09:01.465 --> 09:04.207
Yes, I gave myself
a Dickensian backstory,

09:04.250 --> 09:06.513
which apparently
made quite the impression.

09:06.557 --> 09:07.993
I'm sorry, Sarge.

09:08.037 --> 09:10.953
Honestly, I don't think
I'm the right director

09:10.996 --> 09:14.086
to bring your vision
of Maxwell Blaze to life.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.522
What does that even mean?

09:15.566 --> 09:16.785
It means you blew it.

09:16.828 --> 09:19.526
Walk away, Jeffords.
Walk away.

09:19.570 --> 09:22.312
Okay, this is gonna be
my mantel shot.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.661
So every time Mom and Dad
look at it,

09:23.705 --> 09:25.228
they'll be reminded
of what David did.

09:25.271 --> 09:26.882
I would say
you should chill out,

09:26.925 --> 09:28.231
but this is actually
making me feel great

09:28.274 --> 09:29.972
about my family,
so let's dive in.

09:30.015 --> 09:32.839
Everybody say "possession
with intent to distribute"!

09:32.840 --> 09:34.015
Hey.

09:34.059 --> 09:35.582
- Oh!
- Ah, David, hi there.

09:35.626 --> 09:37.236
That was unrelated
to your recent arrest

09:37.279 --> 09:38.585
for possession
with intent to distribute.

09:38.629 --> 09:40.152
- How are you?
- Not great.

09:40.195 --> 09:41.545
Yeah, jail is rough.

09:41.588 --> 09:43.024
You got to go poop
in front of everyone.

09:43.068 --> 09:44.548
I remember when I was in prison,

09:44.591 --> 09:46.114
I held it for weeks,
and when I finally did go,

09:46.158 --> 09:47.464
it was...

09:47.507 --> 09:49.248
You know what, Jake?
This isn't about you.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.163
So, David, did you get fired,

09:51.206 --> 09:52.904
or is there gonna be, like,
a hearing?

09:52.947 --> 09:55.210
She's asking so she can
be there to support you.

09:55.254 --> 09:56.516
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.387
- I'm so excited.
- To support you.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.414
That's what I said.
I'm really looking forward

10:00.415 --> 10:01.581
- to being there.
- To support you.

10:01.581 --> 10:02.748
Yeah, we're saying
the same thing.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.665
- I am pumped this is happening.
- All right, babe,

10:04.709 --> 10:06.188
maybe your brother doesn't want
to talk about what happened.

10:06.232 --> 10:07.276
- Let's just go.
- It's okay.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.887
I owe you guys an explanation.

10:08.930 --> 10:11.803
I actually started doing drugs
when I was a teenager.

10:11.846 --> 10:14.806
You know how Mom and Dad
put so much pressure on us?

10:14.849 --> 10:18.592
- Eventually I just kind of cracked.
- Wait, you felt pressure?

10:18.636 --> 10:20.638
You always seemed
to effortlessly thrive

10:20.681 --> 10:23.457
at everything.
I was so jealous.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.994
But knowing that you also felt
the pressure...

10:25.037 --> 10:25.933
All right, we can drop the act.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.015
I just didn't know
who was listening.

10:27.016 --> 10:28.496
- What act, now?
- Everything I've said before

10:28.540 --> 10:29.889
just now is a lie.
I'm being framed.

10:29.932 --> 10:31.630
I've been investigating
these dirty cops

10:31.673 --> 10:33.457
who are being paid off
by the Brazilian mob.

10:33.501 --> 10:35.634
Oh, Brazilian mobsters
are so good-looking.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.723
They're just a bunch of
Giseles, the women and the men.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.507
Yes, it's insane.
They're all gorgeous.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.161
Anyway, I think I got too close.

10:41.204 --> 10:43.598
Those dirty cops must have
planted the drugs in my desk.

10:43.642 --> 10:46.296
So what you're saying is,
you're not addicted to cocaine?

10:46.340 --> 10:48.603
Amy, it's me.
I don't even drink coffee.

10:48.647 --> 10:49.822
I have too much respect
for my body.

10:49.865 --> 10:50.953
This is water.

10:50.997 --> 10:52.520
And you didn't feel pressure

10:52.564 --> 10:54.435
- from Mom and Dad?
- No, they're so supportive.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.655
I'd actually love
some constructive criticism.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.265
It's the only way to grow.

10:58.308 --> 11:00.136
Anyway, thank you so much
for bailing me out.

11:00.180 --> 11:02.356
If you can just drop me off
at home, I will clear my name,

11:02.399 --> 11:03.923
and things can go back
to the way they were.

11:03.966 --> 11:05.228
The way they were.
Great.

11:05.272 --> 11:07.840
It's my favorite way
of things being.

11:07.883 --> 11:10.886
Okay, Alfonso, I hope
you like it here in holding.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.019
It's gonna be a while.

11:14.629 --> 11:18.546
- So... what they got you in here for?
- Drugs.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.331
They want me to flip,
but I'm no snitch.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.769
I'd rather do the time.
How about you?

11:23.812 --> 11:26.423
I pushed a man,
just to see him frown.

11:26.467 --> 11:27.860
He is terrible.

11:27.903 --> 11:31.472
Yeah, it's almost like
casting a robotic old nerd

11:31.515 --> 11:32.908
was a huge mistake.

11:32.952 --> 11:34.649
Was it a mistake, Sarge?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.564
Or was it
a stroke of brilliance?

11:36.608 --> 11:38.174
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you're a good actor.

11:38.218 --> 11:40.307
You could even be a great one.
But you're too gentle.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.004
Life hasn't kicked
you around enough.

11:42.048 --> 11:44.964
I mean, I grew up poor, and my
father was emotionally abusive.

11:45.007 --> 11:46.226
It's not enough.

11:46.269 --> 11:47.662
You needed to be rejected by me,

11:47.706 --> 11:49.751
a man you admire so much.

11:49.795 --> 11:52.362
What? So all this
was just to make me mad?

11:52.406 --> 11:54.887
I need you to feel
the anger and resentment

11:54.930 --> 11:59.195
that Tyrone McCallister feels
every single day of his life.

11:59.239 --> 12:01.284
Who's Tyrone McCallister?

12:01.328 --> 12:02.721
You are.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.593
That's the part I wrote for you
all along.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.334
This is so stupid, Boyle.

12:07.377 --> 12:08.596
You can't manipulate somebody
like this

12:08.640 --> 12:09.945
and then expect them
to get on board.

12:09.989 --> 12:11.077
Right, Sarge?

12:11.120 --> 12:13.253
Sarge?

12:13.296 --> 12:15.908
My name's Tyrone.

12:15.951 --> 12:17.257
Tyrone McGallagher.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.520
- McCallister.
- McCallister.

12:19.563 --> 12:21.261
So I checked up
on David's case file.

12:21.304 --> 12:22.741
He passed his drug test.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.873
Apparently he has the cleanest
blood they've ever seen.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.527
I knew this was all too good
to be true.

12:26.570 --> 12:28.137
Now David's gonna clear his name

12:28.181 --> 12:30.618
and singlehandedly take down
drug dealers and dirty cops

12:30.662 --> 12:32.098
and get another medal
from the governor.

12:32.141 --> 12:34.013
It sounds pretty dangerous.
Maybe we should help him.

12:34.056 --> 12:35.579
Pretty sure he can
handle this on his own.

12:35.623 --> 12:37.103
That's never been
a problem for him.

12:37.146 --> 12:39.583
All right, look, Ames.

12:39.627 --> 12:41.063
I never had a brother,

12:41.107 --> 12:42.325
but I know four guys who did,

12:42.369 --> 12:44.588
and they would have fights
and squabbles,

12:44.632 --> 12:48.070
but in the end, they always
had each other's shells.

12:48.114 --> 12:49.876
Are you talking about
the Ninja Turtles?

12:49.878 --> 12:51.411
Of course I'm talking
about the Ninja Turtles!

12:51.412 --> 12:51.977
Ugh.

12:51.978 --> 12:53.299
Look, if something happens
to your brother,

12:53.300 --> 12:54.736
you are gonna regret it,

12:54.780 --> 12:56.477
just like Raph regretted it
when he abandoned Leo

12:56.521 --> 12:57.565
in the Technodrome with Krang.

12:57.609 --> 12:58.784
I don't know what that means.

12:58.828 --> 13:00.351
Well, that's on you.
It's a classic.

13:00.394 --> 13:01.787
The point is,
if your brother gets hurt

13:01.831 --> 13:03.789
and you don't get his back now,

13:03.833 --> 13:05.443
it's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.

13:05.486 --> 13:07.097
You're right.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.794
- Obviously you're right.
- Thank you.

13:08.838 --> 13:10.187
If David gets killed
by the Brazilian mafia,

13:10.230 --> 13:12.058
my parents' mantel
is gonna become, like,

13:12.102 --> 13:13.799
- a permanent shrine to him.
- No, that's not what I meant.

13:13.843 --> 13:15.018
Oh, the thought of it
makes me want to puke.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.584
You've learned the wrong lesson.

13:16.628 --> 13:17.847
Come on,
let's go help the bastard.

13:17.890 --> 13:20.501
Don't love how we got here,
but we're going where I want.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.214
I'm glad you guys are here.

13:23.215 --> 13:24.956
So this place is run
by the Brazilian mob.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.583
My CI tells me there's a ledger
with all the cops on payroll

13:27.584 --> 13:28.380
hidden in here somewhere.

13:28.381 --> 13:30.427
I'm guessing it's in that room
surrounded by armed guards.

13:30.470 --> 13:31.515
Those are guards?

13:31.558 --> 13:32.690
I thought they were models.

13:32.733 --> 13:34.387
We need a plan to get past them.

13:34.431 --> 13:35.997
So here's what I'm thinking.
I speak a little Portuguese

13:36.041 --> 13:38.173
from that time I opened
a school in the favelas of Rio.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.174
- Ugh, barf.
- What?

13:39.218 --> 13:39.908
I said barf.

13:39.909 --> 13:41.345
I can't deal with
your bragging anymore.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.520
How is that bragging?

13:42.563 --> 13:44.087
I said
I speak a little Portuguese

13:44.130 --> 13:45.697
when I'm actually fluent.

13:46.403 --> 13:47.956
Ugh, shut up!

13:47.999 --> 13:50.132
Look, if you're so angry
with me, why are you even here?

13:50.175 --> 13:51.916
Because Jake convinced me
if you die,

13:51.960 --> 13:53.614
I'd never hear the end of it
from Mom and Dad.

13:53.657 --> 13:54.977
That's not exactly
how I phrased it.

13:54.977 --> 13:56.283
Look, I get it.
You're jealous.

13:56.326 --> 13:58.763
I'd be jealous too
if someone was better than me

13:58.807 --> 14:00.069
at everything their whole life.

14:00.113 --> 14:01.853
- Oh, no.
- Not everything.

14:01.897 --> 14:04.406
- I have more allergies than you.
- Not the best brag.

14:04.407 --> 14:05.640
I have so many allergies,
I just found out

14:05.683 --> 14:07.729
- I'm allergic to chia seeds.
- But apparently effective.

14:07.772 --> 14:10.123
I'm allergic to chia
and acai berries.

14:10.166 --> 14:12.299
Yeah? My throat gets scratchy
when I eat stone fruit.

14:12.342 --> 14:15.954
Oh, yeah? I'm also
a better dancer than you.

14:15.998 --> 14:18.348
Ames, you have badly
misjudged your own abilities.

14:18.392 --> 14:20.350
You think you're better than me?

14:21.177 --> 14:22.526
Oh, damn.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.398
She's got a shot.

14:25.094 --> 14:28.097
- What, afraid to use your forearms?
- Pretty good.

14:28.141 --> 14:29.881
You're not using enough elbow!

14:29.925 --> 14:32.362
Guys, those aren't the parts
people feature when they dance.

14:32.406 --> 14:34.364
Now can we please find a way
to distract those guards?

14:34.408 --> 14:37.106
Don't worry, Jake, 'cause
I'm about to end this thing.

14:37.150 --> 14:38.760
Death drop!

14:38.803 --> 14:40.414
Ow!

14:40.457 --> 14:41.763
Ow, ow, ow!

14:41.806 --> 14:43.373
- Oh, that looked really bad.
- Are you okay?

14:43.417 --> 14:45.201
Oh, look, the guards
are leaving their post.

14:45.245 --> 14:47.508
Looks like they're coming here to
help you. Jake, you should go now.

14:47.551 --> 14:49.553
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm "fone."

14:49.597 --> 14:51.033
Oh, well,
as long as you're "fone."

14:51.077 --> 14:52.774
- Jake, go.
- All right, fine.

14:55.037 --> 14:56.430
Believe me, they're perfect.

14:56.473 --> 14:57.866
They're about 5 1/2 pounds each,

14:57.909 --> 15:01.435
and they look so good
smushed together.

15:01.478 --> 15:02.610
Or dangling.

15:03.959 --> 15:06.701
Get off me, man.

15:06.744 --> 15:07.789
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:07.832 --> 15:09.704
- Hey.
- Cops, man.

15:09.747 --> 15:11.271
- Mm-hmm.
- Word.

15:11.314 --> 15:13.229
McCallister, your lawyer's here.

15:13.273 --> 15:14.796
He wants to talk to you.
Already?

15:14.839 --> 15:17.320
What the hell, man?
I was just getting started.

15:17.364 --> 15:18.756
And yet it felt like forever.

15:18.800 --> 15:22.151
You were playing at Alfonso,
not with Alfonso.

15:22.195 --> 15:24.197
What are you doing right now,
Sarge?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.850
- Listening to you?
- Yes, listening.

15:25.894 --> 15:27.896
What humans do 95% of the time

15:27.939 --> 15:29.898
and Tyrone does, apparently,
none of the time.

15:29.941 --> 15:32.640
I want you to go back in there
and listen.

15:32.683 --> 15:35.070
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah, okay, jeez.

15:35.071 --> 15:37.552
I mean, you know, look, take
the note about Tyrone or don't.

15:37.595 --> 15:40.163
What do I know?
But also, I created him.

15:41.456 --> 15:42.762
Hey.

15:48.071 --> 15:50.248
McCallister, your lawyer
has more questions for you.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.379
- What?
- Why were you doing that?

15:51.423 --> 15:52.902
You said I should listen!

15:52.946 --> 15:55.427
Well, listening doesn't
always mean being quiet.

15:55.470 --> 15:57.124
Sometimes,
the only way to listen

15:57.168 --> 15:58.517
is to say something.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.432
I'm listening to you right now.

16:00.475 --> 16:02.956
Do you see how I listen?
This is me listening.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.436
You're pissing me off, Boyle!

16:04.479 --> 16:06.568
Ah, and he's back!
Hold on to that aggression.

16:06.612 --> 16:07.874
Yeah, go!
Go, go, go!

16:10.181 --> 16:11.965
What are you looking at?

16:12.008 --> 16:13.880
McCallister.

16:13.923 --> 16:15.621
Terry, Terry, Terry.

16:15.664 --> 16:17.769
I need you to help me see
what I'm not seeing.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.192
Why can't you do this?

16:19.195 --> 16:20.610
You're giving me too many notes.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.853
Okay, well, then I can boil
it down for you into one note:

16:23.896 --> 16:25.289
Tyrone is an ocean.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.899
I don't know what that means.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.684
It means I want you
to be tough but vulnerable,

16:28.727 --> 16:30.860
brave but scared,
jittery but perfectly still.

16:30.903 --> 16:33.297
Also, pace it up a little.
Come on, buddy, you got this.

16:33.341 --> 16:35.256
Man, these stupid cops
won't leave me alone.

16:35.299 --> 16:37.258
What the hell?
They think I'm a snitch?

16:37.301 --> 16:38.563
- Not me.
- I hear that.

16:38.607 --> 16:40.043
McCallister,
I need to talk to you.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.131
- No!
- Excuse me?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.350
I don't want any more notes.

16:42.393 --> 16:43.785
I've gone undercover before.

16:43.786 --> 16:45.614
Now just back off
and let me do this!

16:47.790 --> 16:48.965
Uh-oh, Alfonso,

16:49.009 --> 16:51.881
seems as though we got a pig
in our midst.

16:51.925 --> 16:53.535
Looks like we can only trust
each other.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.668
Come on, man,
you're obviously a cop too.

16:55.711 --> 16:58.018
You keep talking
about how nefarious you are.

16:58.061 --> 16:59.541
Jake, let us in!

16:59.585 --> 17:01.064
I think she's gonna be okay,

17:01.108 --> 17:02.675
but she's probably got
a low-grade concussion.

17:02.718 --> 17:04.851
I wish you hadn't tried
to do a death drop.

17:04.894 --> 17:07.375
The ladies on "Drag Race"
make it look so easy.

17:07.419 --> 17:08.897
I know, you don't get
that reference because

17:08.942 --> 17:10.813
- you don't have a television.
- Why?

17:10.857 --> 17:13.119
Amy, I'm sorry for getting
so competitive back there.

17:13.163 --> 17:15.078
You guys are helping me out,
and I should just be grateful.

17:15.122 --> 17:17.516
Of course you're being nice
to me when I'm being a monster.

17:17.559 --> 17:19.213
Well, you know what,
Mr. Perfect?

17:19.257 --> 17:20.519
I'm gonna find that ledger,

17:20.561 --> 17:21.867
and I'm gonna save
your stupid butt.

17:21.911 --> 17:24.348
- That would be so great.
- Please stop.

17:24.392 --> 17:25.953
Maybe there's
a hidden panel somewhere?

17:25.954 --> 17:26.911
It's not in the desk.

17:26.954 --> 17:28.075
I bet it's in this old safe.

17:28.076 --> 17:29.469
That seems like
a lot of work to open

17:29.512 --> 17:30.861
every time
you have to pay a bribe.

17:30.905 --> 17:33.951
I would keep it
in this filing cabinet.

17:35.779 --> 17:37.738
I found it!

17:37.781 --> 17:39.653
I beat the golden boy!
I'm the golden girl!

17:39.696 --> 17:41.045
Hey, open up!

17:41.089 --> 17:42.482
- Who's in there?
- Okay, everybody out.

17:42.525 --> 17:44.048
Go! Go, go, go!

17:46.318 --> 17:47.748
Hey, get off me!

17:47.791 --> 17:50.054
My God, you're even more
stunning up close.

17:53.026 --> 17:54.636
I called for backup,
but it could take ten minutes.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.942
- Should we storm the place?
- Too late.

17:55.985 --> 17:57.291
Look, they're bringing Jake out.

17:57.334 --> 17:59.772
I told you, I was in the
office because I work there,

17:59.815 --> 18:01.295
and we've actually met
a bunch of times,

18:01.338 --> 18:02.557
and it's crazy
you don't remember me!

18:02.601 --> 18:04.480
What should we do?
If they get away,

18:04.483 --> 18:05.605
we'll never be able
to track them.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.220
Shoot out the tires.

18:08.057 --> 18:09.188
You're a way better shot
than me.

18:09.232 --> 18:10.302
- You should do it.
- Are you crazy?

18:10.304 --> 18:11.811
- You're the golden girl.
- David, take the shot.

18:11.812 --> 18:13.031
I just don't want you to feel
bad about yourself...

18:13.075 --> 18:14.119
Take the shot!

18:18.080 --> 18:20.865
You're under arrest,
you beautiful man.

18:20.908 --> 18:23.215
Cuff this son of a bitch.

18:23.259 --> 18:25.696
Oh, my God,
you also smell so good.

18:25.739 --> 18:28.351
Brazil!

18:28.394 --> 18:30.048
All right,
so first things first,

18:30.092 --> 18:31.702
I think I owe you both
something,

18:31.745 --> 18:34.661
and it's this.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.446
Stop clapping!
There's nothing to clap about.

18:36.489 --> 18:38.883
Look, I know you're upset,
but everything went great.

18:38.926 --> 18:40.754
Great?
You ruined this mission.

18:40.798 --> 18:42.234
Yeah, we might have
gotten him to talk

18:42.278 --> 18:44.019
if you didn't give me notes
every two seconds.

18:44.062 --> 18:46.630
Guys, you performed exactly
the way I expected you to.

18:46.673 --> 18:49.241
It's just that you were both
supporting characters.

18:49.285 --> 18:50.895
Hey, Boyle,
I did what you asked.

18:50.938 --> 18:52.244
Alfonso told me everything.

18:52.288 --> 18:53.506
Yes! I knew it would work.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.899
What?
What's going on?

18:54.942 --> 18:56.640
You were never my real star,
Sarge.

18:56.683 --> 18:58.163
But I needed to create a scene

18:58.207 --> 19:00.557
so that Alfonso would think
that my mission had failed.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.211
Then I could send in...

19:02.254 --> 19:05.431
Ricki Sheetz, DJ by night,
gun smuggler by later night.

19:05.475 --> 19:06.911
Alfonso started telling me

19:06.954 --> 19:08.565
about all the crazy crap
you guys pulled in there.

19:08.608 --> 19:09.870
He just couldn't stop talking

19:09.914 --> 19:11.568
till he gave me the name
of his supplier.

19:11.611 --> 19:13.918
Rosa was my leading lady
from the start.

19:13.961 --> 19:15.615
- She's the only good actor here.
- She is?

19:15.659 --> 19:17.008
Yeah, you know nothing
about my real life.

19:17.052 --> 19:19.445
- I'm always acting.
- Well done, Boyle.

19:19.489 --> 19:22.100
You've executed this mission
flawlessly. I'm impressed.

19:22.144 --> 19:24.581
Wait, if you were gonna use
Diaz the whole time,

19:24.624 --> 19:25.886
why didn't you just
tell us that?

19:25.930 --> 19:27.410
Because you two
would have given it away

19:27.453 --> 19:28.672
with your terrible acting.

19:28.715 --> 19:30.021
No offense, but I can read

19:30.065 --> 19:32.110
every emotion you're feeling
on your face.

19:32.154 --> 19:34.025
- Can you read this one?
- Actually, yes.

19:34.069 --> 19:36.245
You're trying to be tough,
but inside,

19:36.288 --> 19:40.118
you're super impressed by what
I've accomplished today.

19:40.162 --> 19:42.425
Damn, you're right.
You're good.

19:42.468 --> 19:45.428
Thank you, everyone,
for joining me again.

19:45.471 --> 19:47.082
To David.
You're my hero.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.171
And to Amy.
You saved my butt.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.608
You're a great cop
and a great sister.

19:51.651 --> 19:55.177
Wow. That means a lot
coming from you.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.787
You've always been a role model
for me.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.441
He's everyone's role model.

19:58.484 --> 19:59.746
That's why he's on the mantel.

20:01.487 --> 20:03.707
I have to go to the bathroom.

20:06.017 --> 20:07.543
Hey, are you okay?

20:07.548 --> 20:09.158
Yeah, I just had to go
to the bathroom, like I said.

20:09.201 --> 20:10.551
Oh, great.
I thought you went in there

20:10.594 --> 20:12.248
to give yourself a pep talk
in the mirror

20:12.291 --> 20:13.510
like the girl
from the deodorant commercial.

20:13.554 --> 20:14.750
I don't know
what you're referring to.

20:14.751 --> 20:15.839
She wants the big promotion,

20:15.883 --> 20:17.189
but there's just one problem.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.544
She got skunk pit.
We'll watch it later.

20:19.545 --> 20:21.155
The point is,
I came to comfort you.

20:21.199 --> 20:24.245
Aw, thanks, but I actually
feel really great.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.118
I've spent my whole life trying
to beat David at something,

20:27.161 --> 20:29.947
but when you were in danger,

20:29.990 --> 20:32.123
I just didn't care anymore.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.604
All I wanted was for you
to be okay.

20:34.647 --> 20:37.476
I may never have the mantel,
but it doesn't matter,

20:37.520 --> 20:38.467
'cause I have you.

20:38.468 --> 20:39.773
Well, I'm very proud of you,

20:39.817 --> 20:42.298
and I also wish you had told me that
before you went to the bathroom,

20:42.341 --> 20:44.038
because I really roasted
your mom back there.

20:44.082 --> 20:46.389
And another thing,
you should appreciate Amy more,

20:46.432 --> 20:47.781
because she's amazing.

20:47.825 --> 20:49.305
And another thing,
when you come to visit us,

20:49.348 --> 20:50.828
you don't have to bring
your own coffee.

20:50.871 --> 20:52.134
Our coffee is fine.

20:52.177 --> 20:53.961
And another thing,
I know enough Spanish

20:54.005 --> 20:55.485
to understand what idiota means!

20:55.528 --> 20:56.834
And another thing!

20:56.877 --> 20:58.879
When you say I have
an "interesting nose,"

20:58.923 --> 21:00.968
I know you mean big!

21:01.012 --> 21:02.709
I got lost in it.

21:02.753 --> 21:04.711
There were, like,
35 "another things."

21:04.755 --> 21:06.496
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

21:06.539 --> 21:07.975
You were defending my honor.

21:08.019 --> 21:09.499
And I'm glad you said something.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.849
So should I go back
and apologize to your mom?

21:11.892 --> 21:13.111
Oh, hell no.
We're sneaking out the back.

21:13.155 --> 21:14.852
Oh, thank God.
She is terrifying.

21:14.895 --> 21:16.723
See ya at Thanksgiving,
Mrs. Santiago.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.725
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:18.769 --> 21:21.032
Fremulon.
