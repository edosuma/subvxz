08:52.233 --> 08:53.495
Thiswas no bear.

08:54.936 --> 08:56.927
Bears don'tattack
people underwater.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.173
Probablya beaver,then.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.482
Some guygot killed

Afragmentofa tooth,

09:52.026 --> 09:54.256
onetheysaycouldn't
have comefrom any bear.

09:53.227 --> 09:57.163
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

09:54.729 --> 09:57.163
Oh,well,then I'm sure
thatthat'swhat itwas.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.555

10:06.974 --> 10:09.704

11:45.773 --> 11:47.297

Thereyou go.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.369
Great.

11:55.950 --> 11:57.212
Maybe I should see--

11:56.951 --> 11:58.077

12:01.288 --> 12:03.483
I can deal with
dead men--bodies.

12:02.623 --> 12:03.885
Ohh.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.083
Uhh. Ohh,jeez.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.059
How long did this attack

12:14.335 --> 12:17.099
Seconds.

12:23.644 --> 12:26.579
Oh, and, uh,this is how

12:28.616 --> 12:29.548
Uh-huh.

12:31.619 --> 12:34.281

12:32.853 --> 12:35.583

12:35.856 --> 12:39.019

12:47.668 --> 12:49.636

12:49.770 --> 12:51.499
Didyou talk

12:58.045 --> 13:00.912
I'm a little unclear

12:59.847 --> 13:01.212

You gota thing

13:23.604 --> 13:24.628
God.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.534
Mosquitoes. I gota thing

13:26.974 --> 13:28.532
Ifyou're all set,
let's go.

13:33.447 --> 13:34.607
We're saved.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.708
Amuseum in NewYork

13:37.751 --> 13:40.311

Hi.

13:45.426 --> 13:47.394
Uh, some museum

13:47.161 --> 13:49.061
What, arewe all
museum bigots in Maine?

13:48.395 --> 13:49.828
She's rude sarcastic.

13:50.431 --> 13:52.194
You two should
getalong.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.333
I'm afraid I can't letyou
gowith us, ma'am.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.095
SheriffKeough
said I could.

13:55.736 --> 13:58.261
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedesthe sheriff.

13:57.738 --> 13:59.330
Whydoyou haveto supersede?
Maybe I might be of--

13:59.006 --> 14:00.098
Ma'am, look,

14:01.609 --> 14:04.043
this isn'tsome kind of
fact-finding expedition.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.335
Yes, I knowthat.

14:04.445 --> 14:05.776
It's nota sciencetrip.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.244
Couldyou be
a little more condescending?

14:08.082 --> 14:09.811
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

14:09.483 --> 14:11.747
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.819
I appreciate
you'retryingto help.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.649
I'm reallyglad thatyou
broughtthe raid.

14:16.357 --> 14:17.324
Now,that's better.

14:18.392 --> 14:19.552
Ma'am,
it's notgonna work--

14:21.095 --> 14:22.687
Ifyou call me ''ma'am''
one moretime, I'll sueyou,

14:22.129 --> 14:23.596
and with today's laws,
it's possible.

14:23.364 --> 14:24.456
She's good.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.023
Look, I won't interfere.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.728
And ifI do,you've got
a sheriffhandyto arrestme,

14:29.103 --> 14:31.970
but I understand ifI threaten
your Fish and Game authority--

14:31.171 --> 14:32.138
Excuse me.

14:33.407 --> 14:34.567
Is ittrue
you're goingto look

14:36.343 --> 14:38.072

in Black Lake?

14:37.378 --> 14:40.438
Well,we'rejustgonna
investigate an accident.

14:38.612 --> 14:39.636
There's no monster.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.507
We heard a man
was bit in half.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.881
Well,
therewas an accident.

14:44.652 --> 14:47.212
That's all. It's

Oh, please.

16:01.301 --> 16:04.429
and howwouldyou have
accomplished this, ma'am?

16:02.536 --> 16:03.764
Well...

16:04.071 --> 16:06.005
Hewasverysick,

16:07.274 --> 16:10.368
and--and he refused
to goto a doctor.

16:08.575 --> 16:11.840
He'd be coherentone day
and incoherentthe next.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.841
And,well,
one coherentday

16:13.747 --> 16:15.442
he asked meto end
his suffering.

16:17.084 --> 16:18.415
And, um...

16:19.419 --> 16:22.684
he kept insisting
and insisting

16:21.188 --> 16:24.282
and then,well,
finally Ijustgave in,

16:22.589 --> 16:24.523
and I hit him on the head
with a skillet,

16:25.926 --> 16:27.689
then buried him
outatthe bulkhead.

16:29.096 --> 16:31.360
Well, dig him up
ifyou don't believe me,

16:31.098 --> 16:32.326
Sherlock.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.531
Keough: Halfmile up
there's a clearing.

16:38.705 --> 16:41.037
What'swith thewater?
It's so black.

16:46.446 --> 16:48.038
There's nowaves
oranything.

16:49.716 --> 16:51.650
Well,theywanted to
call it ''Lake Placid,''

16:52.119 --> 16:54.417
butsomebodysaid
that namewastaken.

16:53.787 --> 16:55.015
It'stoo bad.

16:55.789 --> 16:57.222
Tentswere sent
ahead.

16:59.292 --> 17:00.725
Theyshould
already be set up

17:03.063 --> 17:04.325
bythetime
we getthere.

17:04.564 --> 17:05.656
Tents?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.657
We're staying
in tents?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.165
I toldyou, 2 days
we'd haveto camp.

17:08.568 --> 17:09.829
Yes, camp,

17:10.237 --> 17:11.829
but I thoughtthatmeant
''Ramada Inn.''

17:13.073 --> 17:15.007
I never heard tents.
Will there betoilets?

17:14.407 --> 17:16.501
Maybewe should
justtakeyou back.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.339
Why, because
I prefera toilet?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.010
Oh, God.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.010
Weforgotto pack
feminine napkins.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.174
Oh, soyou're
with him now?

17:23.583 --> 17:24.515
Taking his side.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.852
I didn't
saya word.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.021
Oh, no, maybe I should
justwipe myself

17:28.088 --> 17:30.022
with some leafy little piece
ofpoison oak.

17:29.589 --> 17:31.181
And then I could
spend thewhole day

17:31.591 --> 17:33.889
scratching myass,
blending in with the natives.

17:33.593 --> 17:35.993
Thenyou'd be back
on myside.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.854
You know,you really
don't haveto bother

17:37.631 --> 17:39.394
telling people
you'refrom NewYork.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.533
Whatthe hell
isthat?

17:41.768 --> 17:42.757
What?

17:43.603 --> 17:45.537
There. I thought
I sawsomething.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.732
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

17:46.173 --> 17:48.437
Oh, myGod.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.134
Aah!

17:52.913 --> 17:54.778

Stop hitting me.

18:05.325 --> 18:06.417
Don'tthrow heads

18:06.326 --> 18:07.759
Stop calling me
''ma'am!''

18:07.394 --> 18:08.622
Aw,Jesus.

18:08.562 --> 18:10.291
Oh, God.

18:11.064 --> 18:12.895
So, sheriff...

18:12.365 --> 18:14.299

18:14.167 --> 18:15.327

18:17.070 --> 18:18.503
Could it be a bear?

18:24.077 --> 18:25.567
I mean,the bears
get big here, right?

18:31.752 --> 18:35.449
Hmm. I don'tthinka bear
could bite offa moose's head.

18:33.253 --> 18:35.585
Everythingyou need
should be in there.

18:34.821 --> 18:36.186
Ok. Good. Good.

18:38.592 --> 18:40.184
Sowill we be
tent-matesthen?

18:40.994 --> 18:42.427
Nope.
This is allyours.

18:42.429 --> 18:44.192
Ohh. Great.

18:44.097 --> 18:45.189
Excellent.

18:45.599 --> 18:47.032

18:47.434 --> 18:49.368
Uh, onething

18:48.602 --> 18:50.536
Uh,what's it like
to be a woman

18:50.103 --> 18:51.536

18:52.105 --> 18:54.801
I mean,the guys don'tturn

18:55.609 --> 18:57.543
Oh.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.369

19:04.050 --> 19:05.483
Hmm.

19:06.052 --> 19:07.917

19:08.121 --> 19:10.555
I have good hygiene.
I'm notwelcome.

19:09.623 --> 19:10.749
Whyareyou here,

19:11.558 --> 19:12.752

19:16.062 --> 19:18.030
Amuseum doesn'tsend an

19:17.264 --> 19:18.356
Howwouldyou know

19:18.532 --> 19:20.124

19:20.567 --> 19:21.829
Well, even iftheydid,

19:21.735 --> 19:24.636
I doubtwhether he orshe

19:23.403 --> 19:24.631
So I don't liketents.
Why--

19:24.738 --> 19:26.467
Oh,you don't liketents,
andyou don't like mosquitoes.

19:27.707 --> 19:28.901

yourfingernails.

19:30.811 --> 19:32.244
What'swrong
with myfingernails?

19:32.078 --> 19:33.875
You have as much business
being in thewoods

19:33.079 --> 19:34.137
as Emily Post.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.014
No, itdoesn'tmake sense.

19:36.449 --> 19:38.815
Theysentyou out here
to examine a tooth.

19:37.584 --> 19:39.814
And whatareyou doing

19:39.085 --> 19:40.518
Oh, no.

19:41.521 --> 19:42.613

19:54.668 --> 19:55.657
HectorCyr.

19:56.102 --> 19:58.195
He'sthis rich, kook
mythology professor.

20:11.117 --> 20:13.085
To swim with crocodiles.

20:14.287 --> 20:15.754
Crocodiles?

20:15.455 --> 20:16.888
Ifhe's here,

20:21.261 --> 20:22.751
he mustthink

20:22.796 --> 20:24.024
Oh, look...

20:24.297 --> 20:26.265
I admit I'm no
brain scientist,

but I do knowthere's
nowaya crocodile

20:30.470 --> 20:31.732
You beatme!

20:32.639 --> 20:33.731
Balls!

20:37.878 --> 20:39.311
Splendid lake, eh?

20:40.480 --> 20:42.414
Became a man
on a lake likethis.

20:41.648 --> 20:43.081
Rubber raft.

20:43.149 --> 20:45.083
Sylvia Blake.

20:45.151 --> 20:47.381
She gave a like a cow.

20:46.653 --> 20:47.779
Who dowe have

20:48.655 --> 20:49.587

20:54.227 --> 20:55.319
HectorCyr.

20:56.162 --> 20:57.595
Oh,the earth is round
and so shouldyou be.

20:57.664 --> 20:59.564
Who is he?

20:58.832 --> 21:00.697
I need topographic studies.
You gotany?

21:00.333 --> 21:02.301
You don'tjustfly in here
and start barking orders.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.395
I apologize. Ijustdon't

21:18.285 --> 21:19.217
Acrocodile?

21:20.053 --> 21:21.418
Yeah.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.122
They've been migrating north,
you know?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.214
This lake does connect
tothe ocean.

21:24.090 --> 21:25.751
It's notasfarfetched
as itmaysound.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.093
Crocodiles can'tswim
in saltwater.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.592
Yeah,well,that'll be
your little secret.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.690
Come on.
We're losingtime.

21:31.531 --> 21:32.964
Whydid the big one
heckle me?

21:33.934 --> 21:35.333
Hey, pal...

21:36.703 --> 21:38.364
Ifhe's close,
we'll find him.

21:38.204 --> 21:41.332
Theirsignatures
are unmistakable.

22:08.601 --> 22:10.694
Shetellyou
thatwe had sextogether?

22:10.337 --> 22:11.634
Sovigorous!

22:13.540 --> 22:15.599
I never had sex
withyou.

22:16.743 --> 22:18.111
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

22:18.111 --> 22:18.941
God.

22:20.246 --> 22:21.543
Wait.

22:23.313 --> 22:24.245
Stop!

22:23.446 --> 22:26.074
[pinging]

22:24.347 --> 22:25.279
[pinging stops]

22:25.715 --> 22:27.307
Thought
I heard something.

22:26.716 --> 22:28.980
I don'tmean
to be discourteous,

22:32.522 --> 22:34.114
but, uh, how is it

22:33.523 --> 22:35.115
a person could come
to believe

22:35.191 --> 22:36.715
a crocodile
is in New England?

22:37.527 --> 22:39.552
Howcould it
survivewinter?

22:39.195 --> 22:40.685
Long astheir nostrils
don'tfreeze,

22:40.863 --> 22:42.125
theysurvive.

22:43.533 --> 22:44.966
Am I foolish
to explain things?

22:45.635 --> 22:47.068
He had such trouble
with my name.

22:47.203 --> 22:48.727
- Hector.
- Hey.

22:48.538 --> 22:50.028
Isthis
where it happened?

22:50.039 --> 22:51.301
Around here.
Yeah.

22:51.541 --> 22:53.304
We're a milefrom the ocean.
Could've easilymade it here.

22:53.142 --> 22:54.769
Kelly:Assuming he got
thisfar upthe seaboard.

22:54.711 --> 22:55.643
[sonar pinging]

22:56.045 --> 22:57.910
The big ones
have been on the move.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.609
What have I been tellingyou?
You call me crazy.

22:59.582 --> 23:01.345
Kelly:
Hector,just paddle.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.517
You know, Sheriff,

23:02.518 --> 23:04.452
when friends orfamily
saythings,

23:04.320 --> 23:05.753
theytend notto register,

23:06.155 --> 23:07.588
so sometimes it helps
to hear it

23:08.157 --> 23:09.590
from a total stranger.

23:10.159 --> 23:11.285
You'refat.

23:11.661 --> 23:13.629
Jesus. Hector!

23:13.162 --> 23:14.356
Oh,yeah.

23:14.664 --> 23:16.154
Kelly:What'sthat?

23:15.865 --> 23:16.957
What is it?

23:17.900 --> 23:20.494
White perch.

23:19.168 --> 23:20.601
Aretheyfeeding?

23:22.171 --> 23:23.604
Theyaren'tfeeding.

23:23.339 --> 23:24.567
They're scared.

23:26.009 --> 23:27.738
-Aah!
-Aah!

23:27.510 --> 23:28.943
Wells:Jesus!

23:29.012 --> 23:29.944
Cyr: Oh!

23:32.048 --> 23:34.346
Oh!

23:33.850 --> 23:35.681
Getyour legs
outofthewater.

23:35.351 --> 23:36.283
Don'tmove
your legs.

23:36.352 --> 23:37.785
Keough:
Areyou kidding me?

23:42.291 --> 23:44.088
Cyr:
Keepyour legs still.

23:44.193 --> 23:45.125
Getoff!.

23:45.194 --> 23:46.354
Hector,

23:46.696 --> 23:48.129
Move it left!

23:52.468 --> 23:53.628
Paddle, paddle!

23:53.469 --> 23:56.097
No one actuallysaw
anything.

23:54.704 --> 23:56.638
Yes, I realizethat, sir,

23:56.205 --> 23:57.797
butsomething
flipped us over,

23:57.440 --> 23:59.704
and I doubtverymuch
ifitwas a mink.

24:00.143 --> 24:01.576
I am a paleontologist.

24:02.145 --> 24:03.578
I workfor
a natural historymuseum.

24:03.813 --> 24:05.246
I am notsome--

24:06.149 --> 24:07.582
Theydon't believe her.

24:07.650 --> 24:08.742
Thankyou.

24:09.152 --> 24:10.744
It's so rewardingto
imagine mytax dollar

24:10.653 --> 24:13.087
finding itswaytoyou,
you fuck-shit!

24:12.155 --> 24:14.749
You're a saucyflirt.

24:13.322 --> 24:14.755
You were right.

24:14.991 --> 24:16.424
U.S.Wildlife
won'tsend anybody

24:17.493 --> 24:18.926
without
a confirmation.

24:20.163 --> 24:21.596
We don't need 'em.

24:21.664 --> 24:22.596
Sheriff.

24:23.166 --> 24:24.258
Yeah?

24:24.667 --> 24:26.100
Mightwanna come
take a lookatthis.

24:26.169 --> 24:27.602
Oh, myGod.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.102
Worms.

24:28.337 --> 24:29.668
Oh, I gota thing
aboutworms.

24:33.176 --> 24:35.110
It's a human toe.

24:34.677 --> 24:37.441
Some decomposition,
a little acidic--

24:35.678 --> 24:37.612
definitely
been swallowed.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.048
Isthisthe man
whowas killed?

24:42.351 --> 24:44.285
He seemed taller.

24:45.188 --> 24:46.621
Phew.

24:51.527 --> 24:52.960
You gota croc,
all right.

24:54.697 --> 24:56.562
They're
a keystone species.

24:56.699 --> 24:58.792
Did hejust
explain something?

24:58.201 --> 25:00.635
Keystone species effects
thewhole ecosystem.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.337
Come on.

38:56.317 --> 38:58.012
You see it?
How big is it?

38:57.852 --> 38:59.615
Shut up

39:01.256 --> 39:03.190
We losttrackofit.

39:02.657 --> 39:03.885

39:03.658 --> 39:05.592
[squawking noises]

39:05.427 --> 39:06.860
[screaming]

39:07.262 --> 39:08.854
-Grab him!
-Aah!

39:09.264 --> 39:10.754
Pull him in!

39:26.047 --> 39:26.979
Yeah.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.549
Nobodyactuallysaw it.
It happened suddenly.

39:30.018 --> 39:31.952

39:32.787 --> 39:34.550
Itwasn'tthe outboard.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.890

39:38.293 --> 39:39.555

39:41.296 --> 39:42.388

39:51.306 --> 39:53.103
Nobodysawanything.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.045
No.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.109
U.S.Wildlife's
on theirway.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.877
The policewantto keep
everything quiet

40:06.488 --> 40:08.251
sothe press doesn't
getwind ofanything.

40:08.356 --> 40:10.790
Everybodyjustwants us
to...

40:11.493 --> 40:13.256
''Sittight.''

40:13.695 --> 40:15.720
Areyou...ok?

40:15.830 --> 40:17.422
Well...

40:18.833 --> 40:20.323
you know...

40:21.336 --> 40:22.598
Yeah.

40:29.878 --> 40:31.812
Well, Sheriff,
I'm, uh...

40:33.348 --> 40:35.043
Verysorry
aboutyourdeputy.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.916
Hewas a good man?

40:39.020 --> 40:40.282
Yep.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.554
Wheneversomebodydies,
I...

40:47.862 --> 40:50.126
I alwaysthink
that it's such a waste

40:52.066 --> 40:53.533
that I didn't knowthem
any better.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.266
Sorryforyour loss,
Hector.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.201
Not reallywhat I meant.

41:00.808 --> 41:02.742
Head wasjust...

41:03.144 --> 41:04.839
bitten off.

41:06.147 --> 41:08.581
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare

41:10.151 --> 41:11.550
that I was headless.

41:15.823 --> 41:17.290
I'd be down
on the ground

41:17.825 --> 41:19.759
looking up atmy body,
no head,

41:21.329 --> 41:23.763
justwalking around
bumping into everything.

41:23.831 --> 41:25.765
And my parents...

41:25.300 --> 41:27.234
wouldn't letme
in the house.

41:26.834 --> 41:28.768
Becausetheyjust bought
all these antique lamps,

41:28.836 --> 41:30.531
and theydidn'twantme
to knockthem over,

41:31.339 --> 41:32.271
thefuckers.

41:33.341 --> 41:35.400
Then the neighborhood
bullies,

41:35.343 --> 41:36.867
they'd see my round
head on the ground

41:37.345 --> 41:38.778
looking like a ball,

41:39.113 --> 41:40.546
and they'd come over,

41:40.114 --> 41:41.547
and they'd start
a soccergame.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.683
And as I was being
kicked around,

41:43.851 --> 41:45.284
I'd actually
justfeel grateful

41:45.353 --> 41:47.446
for being allowed
in the game.

41:46.854 --> 41:49.015
Whatare--
whatareyourthoughts?

41:48.356 --> 41:50.415
You know, Hector...

41:49.857 --> 41:52.291
I'm sure
you're a fine person

41:51.359 --> 41:53.793
inyourown mental way,

41:56.931 --> 41:58.523
but I think itwould be best

41:59.167 --> 42:01.465
ifyou and I didn'tspeak.

42:01.302 --> 42:03.736
Yaaah!

42:03.805 --> 42:06.239
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

42:06.307 --> 42:08.571
I'm still waiting
to confirm ifthey...

42:07.976 --> 42:10.740
Oh,Jesus.

42:13.481 --> 42:15.415
I--I could probably
cut him down,

42:15.984 --> 42:18.919
butthere'sthis
odd lookofmayhem

42:18.486 --> 42:21.421
on his
upside-down face.

42:23.491 --> 42:25.083
Hank.

42:26.327 --> 42:27.487
Yes?

42:28.329 --> 42:30.160
Areyou all right?

42:31.332 --> 42:33.425
Couldyou cutme down?

42:34.335 --> 42:35.461
Doyou promise

42:36.004 --> 42:37.437
thatyou won'tattempt
to injure me?

42:37.238 --> 42:40.002
I have no interest in ever
looking atyou, Hector.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.232
Ok.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.243
Just, uh, pull him down.

42:42.510 --> 42:44.341
It's a counterweight.

42:44.012 --> 42:45.274
Here. I'll getthe knife.

42:46.848 --> 42:48.645
IfI'd remembered
itwasthere,

42:49.350 --> 42:51.352
I neverwould've let
you walkthatway.

42:51.352 --> 42:54.014
All right. It's over.

42:55.523 --> 42:56.854
It's over. Remember?

42:56.858 --> 42:58.291
You promised
notto hurt him, so...

42:58.726 --> 43:00.660
I lied.

43:01.128 --> 43:02.493
Wait. Hey! Hey!

43:01.262 --> 43:02.695
Come on! Hold up!

43:03.998 --> 43:05.465
Nowhereto go,
myfriend.

43:05.399 --> 43:07.594
Now,just--come on!
Knock itoff!.

43:06.901 --> 43:08.493
Knock itoff.
Putthatdown.

43:08.903 --> 43:09.835
Justsettle...

43:10.337 --> 43:12.328
[roaring]

43:11.839 --> 43:14.808
Jesus! Lookout!

43:13.374 --> 43:15.604
Whoa!

43:15.643 --> 43:17.634
[roaring]

43:17.311 --> 43:18.278
Aw, shit!

43:18.312 --> 43:20.405
[groaning]

43:20.381 --> 43:22.315
Ok.

43:23.417 --> 43:25.681
I admit it.

43:25.719 --> 43:27.653
It's a crocodile.

43:34.095 --> 43:36.120
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

43:37.565 --> 43:40.557
Scaleswere oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.108
Whywould he come here?
It's impossible.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.450
Asia.
Howwould he get here?

43:58.886 --> 44:00.717
Obviouslysome
asshole in Hong Kong

44:01.889 --> 44:03.379
flushed him
down thetoilet.

44:03.991 --> 44:05.856
Hewas 30feet, right?
Had to be.

44:07.061 --> 44:10.053
Well, nowmaybe somebody's
happy I broughtmy big gun.

44:09.697 --> 44:11.221
Ohyou're gonna
blow him away now?

44:11.665 --> 44:12.825
I should thinkso.

44:13.567 --> 44:14.556
Withyourcannon?

44:15.136 --> 44:16.535
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

44:17.071 --> 44:18.003
Well, he's a miracle
ofnature,

44:20.141 --> 44:21.369
but I know
he'sveryscary.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.607
You'rethe miracle
ofnature.

44:22.977 --> 44:24.706
Guys, guys, easy.

44:24.044 --> 44:26.171
We're notgonna do
anythingtonight.

44:25.513 --> 44:29.210
I never heard ofa crocodile
crossing an ocean.

44:26.514 --> 44:27.606
Well,theyconceal
information

44:27.815 --> 44:29.077
likethat in books.

44:29.750 --> 44:30.842
All right, pal!

44:31.552 --> 44:32.780
Hey, hey, hey.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.847
No, no.
Let him go.

44:37.525 --> 44:39.049
I'm sick
ofhim,too.

44:38.692 --> 44:39.624
I do need towarn
you, Sheriff.

44:40.027 --> 44:41.494
Thething
about being rich,

44:41.195 --> 44:42.321
my parents did have
the added luxury

44:42.496 --> 44:43.758
ofditching me off
at karate school

44:44.665 --> 44:46.656
on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.360
Go ahead.
Takeyour bestshot.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.428
Ohh!

44:48.802 --> 44:49.826
Hank!

44:50.004 --> 44:52.165
He said he knew karate.

44:51.338 --> 44:52.202
You hit him.

44:53.407 --> 44:54.669
I did,yeah.

44:55.576 --> 44:57.203
Here.

44:56.810 --> 44:58.903
Did he say ''go''?

44:57.912 --> 45:00.472
Aren'tyou supposed
to say ''go'' in karate?

45:00.147 --> 45:01.409
You're supposed
to say ''go.''

45:01.081 --> 45:03.948
Hank,just keepyour
distancefrom him.

45:02.416 --> 45:04.850
Gotoyourtent.
Cool down.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.086
He doesn'tanswer
myquestions?

45:06.287 --> 45:08.551
Whydon'tyou
answermyquestions?

45:08.923 --> 45:09.890
I fall into a hole.

45:10.257 --> 45:11.690
I go up in a tree.

45:13.194 --> 45:14.354
I swearto God,
I'll say ''go.''

45:15.696 --> 45:16.663
You bow,
and thenyou say ''go.''

45:17.731 --> 45:18.698
As in
''gofuckyourself.''

45:20.067 --> 45:23.264
Jesus.They'rejust
like children.

45:21.101 --> 45:22.295
Yeah.

45:22.603 --> 45:24.002
Oh, myGod.

45:23.837 --> 45:25.896
Areyou all right?

45:24.872 --> 45:26.362
Yeah, I'm all right.

45:25.906 --> 45:26.964
I've gotsomething
forthat.

45:29.176 --> 45:30.108
I can fixthat.

45:30.444 --> 45:31.376
Yeah?

45:31.912 --> 45:32.844
Yeah.

45:34.048 --> 45:35.709
Ohh!

45:35.616 --> 45:38.449
Ijustgotta pull it

45:36.750 --> 45:38.012
Therewe go.

45:37.751 --> 45:39.719
Whotaughtyou
to be a nurse?

45:38.752 --> 45:40.481
Father's a surgeon.

45:39.753 --> 45:41.220
I can even stitch
in a pinch,

45:41.488 --> 45:43.217
which probablywouldn't
be such a bad idea.

45:44.391 --> 45:46.859
Uh, no,thanks.

45:45.726 --> 45:46.750
Ok.

45:47.761 --> 45:50.321
You should have seen
the lookonyourface

45:49.563 --> 45:51.121
when thatcrocjumped out.

45:51.098 --> 45:52.065
Uh-huh.

45:52.900 --> 45:54.663
You seethe look

45:55.436 --> 45:58.200
Thatwasthe look.

45:57.605 --> 45:58.970
I don't know.

46:00.241 --> 46:02.368
The laws ofnature
could be changing,Jack.

46:02.910 --> 46:04.537
Thatthing outthere,
that's--

46:03.944 --> 46:06.276
You're havingthe besttime
ofyour life, aren'tyou?

46:05.779 --> 46:07.178
What?

46:10.251 --> 46:11.980
What? People
have been killed.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.949
I hardlythink I'm
having a good time.

46:13.887 --> 46:15.548
Whywouldyou--

46:15.589 --> 46:16.681
Does itshow?

46:19.326 --> 46:23.262
This isthefirsttime
I've everactually...

46:20.794 --> 46:22.386
you know, been in
the middle ofanything.

46:22.596 --> 46:23.563
Isthatwhyyou're here,

46:24.932 --> 46:27.765
to get in the middle
ofsomething?

46:28.802 --> 46:29.894
Maybe.

46:35.209 --> 46:37.006
I've always read
aboutwhat's happened.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.874
I've never...

46:42.583 --> 46:43.982
We should goto bed.

46:43.617 --> 46:46.085
I mean we should
goto, uh...

46:49.423 --> 46:50.390
rest.

46:52.493 --> 46:55.462
We should goto our
separatetents,

46:54.361 --> 46:56.556
and--here--
getsome--go.

47:01.535 --> 47:02.661
I got it.

47:04.338 --> 47:06.329
Thanksforthe bandage.

47:06.874 --> 47:08.671

47:07.908 --> 47:08.932
Yeah.

47:10.944 --> 47:13.139
Cyr: Itdoesn'teven see him.

47:14.214 --> 47:16.114
There, he got it.

47:21.322 --> 47:23.483
He has one
natural enemy.

47:25.192 --> 47:26.625
Onlyone.

47:27.061 --> 47:28.050
Man?

47:40.541 --> 47:41.508
Man.

47:45.112 --> 47:46.477
Soyou're
the big expert.

47:49.483 --> 47:52.247
You thinkours is some
kind ofmutantor---

47:51.719 --> 47:54.483
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

47:54.221 --> 47:57.554
Biggestone ever killed
on record was 27feet.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.985
Sowhy is he here?

47:58.192 --> 48:00.160
Honestly...

47:59.626 --> 48:01.093
I don't know.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.260
Keepyoureyes peeled.

48:05.299 --> 48:08.166
You know howfast
thesethings can be.

48:08.702 --> 48:10.636
I've gotticks,
I know it.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.099
They'rejust
so drawn to me.

48:17.378 --> 48:18.845
I gota thing
aboutticks.

48:41.268 --> 48:43.702
Crawling
upyour pant leg.

48:43.137 --> 48:45.037
Puttheir heads
underyourskin.

48:46.073 --> 48:47.563
Look.

48:48.075 --> 48:49.042
What?

48:49.777 --> 48:50.835
Jack.

48:51.311 --> 48:53.404
That's a pretty big print.

48:53.814 --> 48:55.008
Gare: Seems like
we're getting lower.

48:56.784 --> 48:59.378
That'swhat happens
when I land.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.614
Whyarewe landing?

48:59.386 --> 49:03.186
Becausethis isthe cove
that he obviously lives in.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.424
Sowhyarewe landing?

49:18.839 --> 49:19.771
Hector!

49:20.107 --> 49:21.597
We can lift it?

49:22.776 --> 49:24.073
Maybe.

49:24.111 --> 49:25.635
Don'twant
to mush itthere.

49:27.981 --> 49:29.278
I'm notmushing it.

49:30.851 --> 49:34.082
You mightmush it.
It's a little soft.

49:41.334 --> 49:43.962
ForChrist's sake,
I'm notmushing it!

49:42.903 --> 49:44.632
Aah!

49:44.271 --> 49:45.203
Aah!

49:45.872 --> 49:46.804
Aah!

49:47.240 --> 49:48.172
Aah!

49:50.544 --> 49:52.978
Oh, God.

49:55.615 --> 49:57.173
Ok.

49:57.417 --> 49:59.544
That is it!
That is it!

49:58.418 --> 50:01.114
No, no, I keep
getting hitwith heads!

49:59.419 --> 50:00.386
Tryto calm down.

50:00.420 --> 50:01.682
You calm down!

50:02.923 --> 50:05.653
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

50:04.558 --> 50:06.856
I'm beingverycalm!
I am composed!

50:06.760 --> 50:07.749
This isthe second time

50:09.529 --> 50:10.621
I've been hit
with a severed head,

50:10.564 --> 50:12.498
and it upsets me!

50:11.898 --> 50:13.490
Whatthe hell?

50:14.701 --> 50:15.633
Aah!

50:17.070 --> 50:18.230
I...

50:18.138 --> 50:20.265
Ijustwantto go back
to mytent now.

50:19.306 --> 50:21.137
Can we please go back?

50:22.843 --> 50:24.174
You gotta be kidding.

50:28.582 --> 50:30.243
I'm not kidding!

50:31.651 --> 50:32.618
Look.

50:32.886 --> 50:34.183
#The itsy-bitsyspider#

50:44.131 --> 50:45.325
# Dum de dum de dum #

50:45.499 --> 50:46.693
Kelly: Oh.

50:47.834 --> 50:49.734
Keough:What?

50:49.402 --> 50:51.165
Look 10feet intothewater.

50:56.710 --> 50:58.302
[crocodile growls]

50:58.578 --> 50:59.670
[moo]

51:01.581 --> 51:03.572
Come and get it!

51:02.849 --> 51:03.781
[moo]

51:04.818 --> 51:06.615
[moo]

51:08.922 --> 51:10.549
Wow.

51:15.128 --> 51:16.425
Disgusting.

51:16.296 --> 51:18.196
I haven't broken any laws.

51:18.365 --> 51:19.627
Oh, butyou have,
ma'am.

51:21.301 --> 51:22.666
You lied to us.

51:27.541 --> 51:29.168
Thatcan be
obstruction ofjustice.

51:30.911 --> 51:31.775
Aman has been killed,

51:32.279 --> 51:33.974
in part because
ofyoursilence.

51:34.247 --> 51:35.179
I could make out
a charge

51:35.582 --> 51:36.810
ofreckless
endangerment.

51:37.017 --> 51:38.211
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed

51:38.718 --> 51:40.879
at howyou treat
yourcows.

51:39.653 --> 51:42.121
The reason I lied,
ifI toldyou thetruth,

51:41.421 --> 51:42.581
you'd hunt itdown
and kill it,

51:42.422 --> 51:44.356
which seemsto be exactly
whatyou'retryingto do.

51:43.723 --> 51:45.486
How long haveyou
been feedingthisthing?

51:44.991 --> 51:46.720
6years.

51:47.227 --> 51:49.092
6years?

51:49.763 --> 51:52.493
Well, Bernie
was outfishing,

51:50.997 --> 51:53.056
and itfollowed
him home.

51:52.999 --> 51:55.058
Sowethrew it
some scraps,

51:54.835 --> 51:56.860
and,well, he didn't
seem to botheranybody.

51:56.636 --> 51:59.662
He became kind oflike a pet
who lives in thewild.

51:58.572 --> 51:59.561
Hejustappeared?

52:01.374 --> 52:02.807
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

52:03.510 --> 52:05.978
No. Doyou?

52:05.645 --> 52:06.839
Your husband Bernie,

52:07.747 --> 52:08.839
you didn't,
byanychance,

52:10.851 --> 52:12.580
lead him tothe lake
blindfolded?

52:11.918 --> 52:13.545
IfI had a dick,

52:13.420 --> 52:15.718
this iswhere I'd
tellyou to suck it.

52:15.956 --> 52:18.220
Did the crocodile
killyour husband?

52:17.224 --> 52:19.852
Yes, but itwas all...

52:18.391 --> 52:19.824
itwas a mistake.

52:20.193 --> 52:21.524
Amistake?

52:21.895 --> 52:25.729
One ofour horses
got loose 2years ago.

52:24.264 --> 52:26.198
Wenttothe lake
to drink,

52:26.600 --> 52:28.534
and the crocodile
started coming in,

52:29.302 --> 52:30.701
and Berniewent
to intercede, and--

52:30.804 --> 52:33.204
ifI'd reported it,

52:32.205 --> 52:34.400
they'd have sent people
to kill it.

52:36.109 --> 52:38.304
Ma'am, howcouldyou
not reportthis?

52:38.111 --> 52:39.544
It puts human life
at risk.

52:40.113 --> 52:42.104
Nobody lives on this lake.

52:41.581 --> 52:43.378
It's really his lake now.

52:44.050 --> 52:45.779
Come on, Hector.
I knowyou're crazy,

52:46.319 --> 52:47.843
butyou can'tdothis.

52:48.588 --> 52:50.579
I need to see his habitat
up close, DeputyGare.

52:50.090 --> 52:51.682
then watch Nova, ok?

52:52.158 --> 52:54.683
Butdon'tgo
in thewater.

52:56.696 --> 52:57.924
Please.

52:58.498 --> 53:00.125
I'll have sex
withyou.

53:00.100 --> 53:01.032
Let'sjust

53:02.168 --> 53:03.635
Darling,

53:03.837 --> 53:05.702
he's notgonna hurtme.

53:06.439 --> 53:07.497
Don't.

53:07.741 --> 53:08.673
Hector!

53:09.442 --> 53:11.808
Murders and rapes
in the cities.

53:10.443 --> 53:11.933
People bomb planes.

53:11.978 --> 53:13.775
Can the police stopthem?
No.

53:15.916 --> 53:17.713
Butfeed one little cow
to a crocodile--

53:25.525 --> 53:27.493
You stay right here
until the police show.

53:30.730 --> 53:32.595
You're under
full house arrest.

53:33.166 --> 53:34.633
Thankyou...

53:34.734 --> 53:36.292
Officer Fuckmeat.

53:36.603 --> 53:39.094
Gare on radio: Sheriff,

Oh, my.

53:48.181 --> 53:49.648
[growls]

53:49.683 --> 53:52.618
Suddenly I feel
a bitfoolish here.

You're different
from the others.

Holyshit.

55:12.766 --> 55:14.893

55:16.936 --> 55:19.871
Justturn the ignition.

55:21.474 --> 55:23.032

55:27.147 --> 55:29.012
Come on!

55:29.616 --> 55:31.379
[engine starts]

55:31.818 --> 55:34.286
I knowthat under
the circumstances,

55:34.821 --> 55:36.015
biting my head off

55:39.626 --> 55:41.526
mightseem viable.

55:40.627 --> 55:42.891
Itwould cheapenyou.

55:42.562 --> 55:44.223
I maygeta shot!

55:44.397 --> 55:45.329
No!

55:46.933 --> 55:49.197
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

55:48.201 --> 55:50.635
Oh,Jesus.All right,
justa littlefurther.

55:50.170 --> 55:51.501
Just likethat.

55:55.775 --> 55:57.106
[growling]

55:57.510 --> 55:59.239
Move over!

55:58.511 --> 55:59.671
Go!

56:00.847 --> 56:02.109
-Go!
- I'm trying!

56:03.349 --> 56:04.941
Ahh!Jesus!

56:04.751 --> 56:05.683
[gunshot]

56:19.999 --> 56:24.299
That'syour last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

56:25.638 --> 56:26.764
You're grounded.

56:28.975 --> 56:30.442
This is somevery
delicate equipment

56:32.979 --> 56:34.207
thatyou're
throwing around.

56:34.647 --> 56:35.705
I don'tcare.
You tryingto killyourself?.

56:58.972 --> 57:00.837
You wantto meet
yourmaker, isthat it?

57:03.343 --> 57:05.038
You mightthink
they're godly,

57:04.544 --> 57:06.034
you mightget
some spiritual lift

57:06.079 --> 57:07.478
outofbackstroking
with dragons,

57:07.380 --> 57:09.940
butyoujust puta deputy
at riskoutthere, sir.

57:08.515 --> 57:10.540
Let's notoverlookthefact
that he didn'teatme.

57:10.450 --> 57:12.884
'Cause hejustate
a cow, stupid.

57:12.218 --> 57:14.652
I'm a civilian.
I'm nota trout.

57:13.786 --> 57:15.255
You have no authority
overmewhatsoever.

57:15.255 --> 57:16.187
Hey, hey,
I can arrestyou.

57:17.891 --> 57:18.880
Well,then do it.

57:19.993 --> 57:22.553
You hurt hisfeelings.

57:22.495 --> 57:24.224
I don'tcare.
Doyou care?

57:24.998 --> 57:26.863
No. He's an asshole.

57:27.303 --> 57:29.203
Didyou want
to be killed by it?

57:27.436 --> 57:29.996
You think I'm that nuts?

57:28.437 --> 57:29.404
Hector.

57:31.807 --> 57:33.240
Whatyoujustdid,

57:34.443 --> 57:37.037
there had to be at leastsome
sortofa death wish going on.

57:36.245 --> 57:38.736
In ancient Melanesia,

57:52.862 --> 57:55.160
people suspected
ofcrimes

57:54.830 --> 57:56.798
would bethrown
tothe crocodiles.

57:57.466 --> 57:59.366
Crocodileswould decide.

57:58.501 --> 58:00.128
Theywould bethejudge.

58:00.002 --> 58:03.563
Oh, and sothatwasyou
wantingto bejudged outthere?

58:02.672 --> 58:05.106
Maybe I was,
and sowhat?

58:05.241 --> 58:07.175
Isthattoo arbitrary?

58:07.610 --> 58:10.078
Betterto be measured
bymywealth?

58:09.645 --> 58:12.136
Betterforme
to getmyself-esteem

58:11.614 --> 58:12.979
looking in the eyes
ofcheap sycophants

58:13.316 --> 58:14.374
craving a meal ticket?

58:16.953 --> 58:18.443
Therewas more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

58:19.455 --> 58:21.855
Therewas more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

58:21.457 --> 58:22.583
Jesus, Hector,
cutthe shit.

58:23.993 --> 58:26.018
Aw,fuck it.

58:26.562 --> 58:29.929
So, can I tell themyou won't
go back in thewater?

58:27.997 --> 58:28.964
Oh,yeah, sure.

58:29.131 --> 58:30.598
I'm notgoing
back in thewater.

58:30.700 --> 58:32.725
Noway I'm going
back in thewater.

58:33.169 --> 58:34.898
Ok.

58:34.370 --> 58:35.962
Kelly.

58:36.472 --> 58:39.441
We can't let'em kill it.

58:39.909 --> 58:42.275
Wells:Yeah,
pull all thetrucks in

58:40.943 --> 58:43.104
and start packing.

58:42.478 --> 58:43.410
Everything?

58:44.580 --> 58:45.512
Yeah.

58:46.382 --> 58:47.542
All right.

58:51.220 --> 58:53.620
Just heard fromWildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

59:02.331 --> 59:04.128
They're gonna be here
in 3 hours.

59:04.767 --> 59:05.961
Ok.

59:07.003 --> 59:09.494
Sowe mightaswell pack up.

59:08.004 --> 59:10.165
Good idea.

59:09.005 --> 59:11.337
Will they
trytotrap him?

59:10.239 --> 59:11.399
Sorry?

59:12.708 --> 59:14.699
Florida Fish and Game.

59:14.577 --> 59:16.340
What'll theydo
when theyget here?

59:15.845 --> 59:17.335
Cyr:Tell her,Jack.

59:18.414 --> 59:21.247
Won't be ableto snag him
in pitments, right?

59:20.650 --> 59:22.641
Andyou tranq him
in thewater,

59:23.052 --> 59:24.144
and he drowns.

59:24.287 --> 59:25.879
Theycould try
totranq him on land.

59:26.355 --> 59:28.414
Oh, sure,theycould,
buttheywon't.

59:28.190 --> 59:29.179
He'staken human life.

59:32.295 --> 59:33.523
The mission will be
to put him down.

59:35.197 --> 59:37.165
Isthattrue?

59:37.266 --> 59:40.463
They've never been able
totrap anything 30feet.

59:38.434 --> 59:40.595
Butthey have
totry, right?

59:40.102 --> 59:42.036
Where aretheygonna
take him, Florida?

59:42.238 --> 59:43.296
BacktoAsia?

59:43.306 --> 59:45.536
I gotenough flaxidyl
with meto put him out--

59:44.607 --> 59:45.596
Forget it.

59:46.642 --> 59:48.667
Jack, hearme out.

59:49.912 --> 59:51.812
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nutfuck,wacko

59:52.148 --> 59:53.172
who's aboutas grounded
as a street pigeon,

59:54.150 --> 59:56.141
Keep going.

59:55.284 --> 59:57.479
Butthisthing...

59:57.586 --> 59:59.747
Here?

59:58.654 --> 01:00:01.020
Maine?

01:00:00.756 --> 01:00:02.280
30feet?

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:04.716
Don'tyou think
we're dealing

01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:05.259
with a bit
ofa miracle?

01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:08.489
Yeah.The miraclewould be
totake him alive.

01:00:08.164 --> 01:00:09.995
Yeah, but ifwe could
neutralize him--

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:11.423
Howarewe gonna
neutralize him?

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:14.666
Lure him on land
and pump him full ofdrugs.

01:00:14.437 --> 01:00:15.426
Oh, right.

01:00:16.505 --> 01:00:17.563
I knowofan empty
oil tank in Portland.

01:00:18.007 --> 01:00:20.475
Ifwe drugged him,we
could contain him there.

01:00:20.676 --> 01:00:22.143
He's 150years old.

01:00:22.578 --> 01:00:26.878
He probablyswam here
from anothercontinent.

01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:25.169
He's migrated to Maine.

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.481
Howthe hell dowe say
wejust kill it?

01:00:26.649 --> 01:00:29.140
Jack,
thisthing being here

01:00:27.783 --> 01:00:29.546
does have some
ecological significance.

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:32.048
Andyou are
in the business

01:00:31.854 --> 01:00:33.913
ofprotectingthings
againstextinction.

01:00:36.225 --> 01:00:37.590
Including deputies.

01:00:37.793 --> 01:00:39.192
I understand that,

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:42.724
but ifit's possible
totake him alive--

01:00:43.666 --> 01:00:44.690
No, it's not possible.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:47.696
Look, hefollows anything
thatmoves, right?

01:00:47.303 --> 01:00:50.136
We seta trap on the beach.
I gotenough net--

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:51.736
No.There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

01:00:50.873 --> 01:00:51.897
It'll keep him
tangled long enough

01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:53.933
forthe drugs
to kick in.

01:00:54.043 --> 01:00:55.032
ForGod's sake,Jack,

01:00:55.144 --> 01:00:56.839
they'vetrapped crocs
biggerthan 20feet.

01:00:57.413 --> 01:00:59.904
This is notcompletely
outofthe question.

01:01:00.316 --> 01:01:01.578
It's possible,
andyou knowthat.

01:01:02.685 --> 01:01:05.119
And thosefucksfrom
Florida won'teven try,

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:06.186
andyou knowthat,too.

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:07.285
