00:23.240 --> 00:25.440
Long before I launched Ashley
Madison there were affairs,

00:25.520 --> 00:27.080
and long after I'm gone
there'll be affairs

00:27.160 --> 00:28.600
and so what I'm just
trying to do is help people

00:28.680 --> 00:30.560
have the most perfect affair.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.160
<i>Biderman says he built a</i>
<i>billion-dollar business</i>

00:34.240 --> 00:35.480
<i>betting on infidelity.</i>

00:35.720 --> 00:39.360
<i>25 million members</i>
<i>in 37 countries.</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:45.000
My phone was dancing across
the table. It was crazy.

00:45.240 --> 00:49.840
They made it sound like it was this
play land of people hooking up...

00:49.920 --> 00:53.280
...it had glamour, sex and crime,

00:53.360 --> 00:57.160
hacking and danger.
It had everything.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.560
Kind of a quick
hookup kind of site...

01:06.720 --> 01:08.920
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of a website,</i>

01:09.000 --> 01:12.360
<i>and the rise and fall of its</i>
<i>ambitious founder Noel Biderman.</i>

01:13.320 --> 01:17.480
<i>The audacious Ashley Madison</i>
<i>dot com was set up in 2011</i>

01:17.560 --> 01:20.800
<i>as a safe place to</i>
<i>arrange illicit affairs.</i>

01:21.440 --> 01:25.920
<i>By 2006 the site had 1.1million</i>
<i>users in North America</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:27.680
<i>and had</i>
<i>launched in Europe.</i>

01:27.960 --> 01:30.080
<i>Its growth after that</i>
<i>was extraordinary.</i>

01:30.200 --> 01:34.000
-26 million people, that's growth!
-It's good business.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.040
What is your goal?
Just keep goin'?

01:36.160 --> 01:38.240
World domination,
keep going to the moon.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.760
<i>In 2007 Biderman became CEO</i>

01:41.840 --> 01:44.520
<i>and found himself in the</i>
<i>middle of a media storm.</i>

01:44.720 --> 01:46.360
I'm not necessarily
encouraging infidelity

01:46.440 --> 01:48.000
I don't think it needs
that much encouragement.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.040
How are you not
encouraging infidelity?

01:50.720 --> 01:53.720
<i>Noel Biderman appeared</i>
<i>continuously on TV chat shows</i>

01:53.800 --> 01:56.000
<i>defending and</i>
<i>promoting the site.</i>

01:56.440 --> 01:59.360
<i>He called himself the</i>
<i>king of infidelity.</i>

02:00.440 --> 02:03.880
<i>His wife, Amanda, also took</i>
<i>part in the promotions.</i>

02:04.160 --> 02:06.480
I see it as a platform that
helps people stay married,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.400
they help millions of
people find contentment,

02:09.479 --> 02:11.240
passion and happiness.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.120
Noel said that society
was changing,

02:14.200 --> 02:17.120
the model of relationships
that we have from the past

02:17.200 --> 02:18.560
and at the moment
isn't working.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.560
A lot of people are
having affairs and

02:20.640 --> 02:22.320
it's all done behind
people's backs.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.040
It's destructive for families.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.680
And they said that they were leading
the way in helping with this.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.560
<i>I was separated</i>
<i>from my wife,</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:33.120
<i>I was working a lot. It's</i>
<i>hard to meet people.</i>

02:33.840 --> 02:35.760
<i>Christopher was looking</i>
<i>for a like-minded woman</i>

02:35.840 --> 02:37.280
<i>to have an affair with.</i>

02:37.520 --> 02:41.720
The big attraction to it
was that it's a hookup,

02:41.800 --> 02:45.040
it's not a date. There
isn't any of the risk,

02:45.280 --> 02:47.640
you know, everybody
knows where they stand.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.920
It was definitely more
geared towards sort of the,

02:51.440 --> 02:56.640
as I like to say, the afternoon
delight, kind of situation.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.200
Kind of a quick hook
up kind of site.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.680
<i>Like any dating site, users</i>
<i>had to choose profile names</i>

03:02.760 --> 03:04.160
<i>and fill</i>
<i>in their preferences.</i>

03:04.240 --> 03:07.840
Experimenting with tantric sex.
One-night stand...

03:07.960 --> 03:10.920
<i>Although these choices</i>
<i>were a little more direct than usual.</i>

03:11.000 --> 03:15.120
...likes to be watched, cuddling
and hugging, and erotic movies.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.520
Sounds like an
interesting weekend.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.480
<i>Tamsin is a marketing</i>
<i>consultant and a serial mistress.</i>

03:24.560 --> 03:27.520
<i>She has chosen affairs to committed</i>
<i>relationships most of her life.</i>

03:27.680 --> 03:32.120
Initially, you know, men are very hesitant
to make the first move.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.880
When we start talking
that's the first thing.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.440
They want to find out, are you real?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.520
Do you really live in the United States?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.360
And that's when I would
start getting emails saying

03:42.440 --> 03:44.160
that this woman checked
out your profile,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.440
she wants to talk to you, this
person's interested in you.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.360
And because if you
didn't have a paid account,

03:51.440 --> 03:52.760
you hadn't bought the credits,

03:52.840 --> 03:55.480
you couldn't see the actual
pictures of the profiles

03:55.560 --> 03:56.800
they were all blurred.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.280
<i>Men had to buy credits</i>

03:59.360 --> 04:02.000
<i>in order to reply to messages</i>
<i>sent to them.</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:08.920
And then once you start talking,
inevitably for some strange reason,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.960
men have this insatiable desire
to send you dick pictures.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.640
Pictures of their penises. Sometimes
it's even the first picture.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.320
I don't even know what
their face looks like.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.839
Okay.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.600
People have affairs and cheat
for a lot of different reasons,

04:26.160 --> 04:28.320
it's not always just physical.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.120
We all like to think it's
that but in reality even men

04:33.200 --> 04:37.640
the vast majority are seeking out an
affair for emotional reasons as well.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.400
I did meet and talk
to quite a few men,

04:41.480 --> 04:42.960
a lot of politicians...

04:43.200 --> 04:45.920
<i>A lot of corporate CEOs,</i>
<i>a lot of guys</i>

04:46.000 --> 04:48.600
<i>who are just in middle management,</i>
<i>just not happy.</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:51.560
<i>I mean that was one thing</i>
<i>about Ashley Madison,</i>

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
<i>you got everything from</i>
<i>construction workers and students</i>

04:55.720 --> 04:57.880
<i>so it was pretty interesting.</i>

04:58.200 --> 05:00.600
<i>People want more from</i>
<i>their relationships,</i>

05:00.680 --> 05:01.880
<i>more from their lives and</i>

05:01.960 --> 05:04.200
<i>not feeling so ashamed</i>
<i>to be honest about</i>

05:04.280 --> 05:05.320
<i>what they really want.</i>

05:05.400 --> 05:07.520
People are gonna have
affairs anyway.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.000
It's always happened,
it's on an increase.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.800
<i>It wasn't in the workplace.</i>

05:11.880 --> 05:14.120
<i>It wasn't with close</i>
<i>friends of the family.</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:15.800
I got that concept.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.600
It's less damaging,
people's needs get met.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.440
<i>Ashley Madison.com was bought</i>

05:22.520 --> 05:26.280
<i>by another of Noel's companies,</i>
<i>Avid Life Media in 2007.</i>

05:26.920 --> 05:30.240
<i>Their promotional videos gave a</i>
<i>veneer of corporate acceptability</i>

05:30.320 --> 05:32.120
<i>to otherwise niche products.</i>

05:33.080 --> 05:36.200
<i>Two years later they created</i>
<i>EstablishedMen.com and</i>

05:36.280 --> 05:40.080
<i>CougarLife.com calling them</i>
<i>innovative dating services.</i>

05:40.400 --> 05:43.240
<i>But the main money maker</i>
<i>was always Ashley Madison.</i>

05:44.240 --> 05:48.520
<i># Looking for someone</i>
<i>other than my wife #</i>

05:48.600 --> 05:53.640
<i># Other than my wife</i>
<i>Ashley Madison's right #</i>

05:53.720 --> 05:55.960
<i>Ashley Madison</i>
<i>became known for their cheeky,</i>

05:56.040 --> 05:58.120
<i>often outrageous press campaigns.</i>

05:58.680 --> 06:00.440
<i># other than my wife #</i>

06:00.920 --> 06:04.320
<i>This cheesy advert</i>
<i>was banned by Australian regulators.</i>

06:04.480 --> 06:07.200
<i># Looking for someone</i>
<i>other than my wife #</i>

06:08.440 --> 06:13.520
<i># Other than my wife</i>
<i>Ashley Madison's right #</i>

06:14.960 --> 06:17.440
<i>They courted</i>
<i>controversy around the world,</i>

06:17.520 --> 06:20.480
<i>translating their glossy</i>
<i>ads everywhere they went.</i>

06:26.080 --> 06:29.840
<i>In 2009 Tiger Woods was</i>
<i>caught cheating on his wife.</i>

06:29.920 --> 06:32.880
<i>Within a week Ashley Madison</i>
<i>had offered to pay him</i>

06:32.960 --> 06:36.280
<i>5 million dollars to be</i>
<i>the face of the brand.</i>

06:36.360 --> 06:38.560
<i>He didn't take the money,</i>
<i>but 4 months later</i>

06:38.640 --> 06:40.720
<i>they had sponsored the Tiger Woods</i>
<i>Mistress Pageant</i>

06:40.800 --> 06:42.280
<i>on The Howard Stern Show.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:45.000
Here's our guest
judge Noel Biderman.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.080
Dude put up a hundred grand.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.760
<i>It seemed that</i>
<i>no gimmick was too tabloid.</i>

06:49.840 --> 06:51.760
<i>...she's mistress number four.</i>

06:51.840 --> 06:55.480
The peculiar genius not just
of their marketing efforts

06:55.560 --> 06:59.400
but I think of their leadership seems
to be to be able to take anything,

06:59.480 --> 07:03.560
even negative news and turn it
into a promotional opportunity.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.560
<i>You are Tiger Woods Mistress,</i>

07:05.640 --> 07:09.640
<i>here comes Noel Biderman with</i>
<i>a check for 75,000 dollars.</i>

07:14.320 --> 07:17.240
<i>Despite the 2008</i>
<i>economic downturn,</i> <i>Ashley Madison appeared to be</i>
<i>recession-proof.</i>

07:21.280 --> 07:24.520
<i>By 2015 Avid Life Media announced</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:28.280
<i>that they had grossed</i>
<i>115 million dollars in the previous year,</i>

07:28.920 --> 07:30.480
<i>up 45 per cent.</i>

07:30.840 --> 07:34.920
<i>Pre-tax profits came in</i>
<i>at 55 million dollars.</i>

07:37.720 --> 07:42.520
<i>But then, on 19th July last</i>
<i>year, everything changed.</i>

07:42.880 --> 07:45.040
<i>Brian Krebbs, a tech journalist,</i>

07:45.120 --> 07:47.520
<i>revealed that Ashley</i>
<i>Madison had been hacked.</i>

07:47.720 --> 07:49.480
<i>Employees had opened</i>
<i>their computers</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:52.400
<i>to find an illustrated</i>
<i>message on their screens.</i>

07:52.800 --> 07:55.360
<i>The Impact Team hackers</i>
<i>threatened to publish</i>

07:55.440 --> 07:58.680
<i>stolen data unless Ashley Madison</i>
<i>and Established Men</i>

07:58.760 --> 08:01.320
<i>shut down</i>
<i>their controversial websites.</i>

08:03.320 --> 08:06.400
<i>The consequences for</i>
<i>not complying as noted</i>

08:06.480 --> 08:09.840
in this threat would be the
release of Ashley Madison

08:09.920 --> 08:12.000
and Established Men client list,

08:12.080 --> 08:15.920
including their names, client
profiles and credit card data.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.120
By the time I've read
the story it hit them,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.760
it was all over the world.

08:19.840 --> 08:25.040
I think every major news agency had
already covered it within 6 to 12 hours.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.560
Avid Life Media

08:26.640 --> 08:30.800
has been fully cooperating
with the police investigation.

08:31.600 --> 08:36.000
This hack is one of the largest
data breaches in the world.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.559
I was in a meeting
and all of a sudden

08:42.760 --> 08:45.040
my phone started dancing
across the table,

08:45.320 --> 08:48.480
and I'm trying to concentrate,

08:48.560 --> 08:49.480
and I'm looking over

08:49.560 --> 08:53.920
and I'm seeing the names
of business associates,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.640
my business clients,
friends of mine,

08:55.720 --> 08:59.200
people I had met on
Ashley Madison contacting me.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.000
And my heart sank.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.960
The hack appeared very
strange because

09:04.040 --> 09:08.920
it was so hollywoodesque as
if it had been scripted.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.240
Crazily so, I mean when you
cover hacks all the time,

09:12.320 --> 09:13.480
it's always very dry.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.000
Nobody's very interested in the details
of how they actually got the data

09:17.080 --> 09:19.000
and spread it.
But this was different.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.240
<i>The impact team</i>
<i>gave Avid Life 30 days</i>

09:22.360 --> 09:23.800
<i>to shut down their sites</i>

09:23.880 --> 09:26.720
<i>enough time for the media</i>
<i>to get into frenzy.</i>

09:32.160 --> 09:36.360
The hackers were blackmailing with
the threat of more data to come.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.120
<i>Everyone was</i>
<i>desperate to know who was using</i>

09:39.200 --> 09:41.800
<i>the world's number one</i>
<i>website for adultery?</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:45.880
<i>When the company didn't comply,</i>

09:45.960 --> 09:48.760
<i>over 30 million user details</i>
<i>were released</i>

09:53.520 --> 09:56.760
<i>Across the world suspicious partners</i>
<i>frantically tried to find out</i>

09:56.840 --> 09:59.080
<i>if their partner was among them.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:03.440
<i>One Australian radio show</i>
<i>went a step further:</i>

10:03.840 --> 10:07.120
<i>They were happy to help trawl</i>
<i>through the data dump. Live on air.</i>

10:07.240 --> 10:09.640
<i>When it came on the news</i>
<i>about the Ashley Madison hack</i>

10:09.720 --> 10:13.760
<i>he sort of went a bit funny</i>
<i>and you've got his details</i>

10:13.840 --> 10:19.240
<i>We've got his details here.</i>
<i>And his details have revealed</i>

10:19.320 --> 10:21.800
<i>that he's actually on the website, Joe.</i>

10:22.200 --> 10:24.880
<i>-Yeah, I'm sorry</i>

10:25.200 --> 10:27.200
<i>Are you freaking kidding me?</i>

10:27.640 --> 10:30.880
The ripple effect of the
impact team's actions

10:30.960 --> 10:34.560
has and will continue to
have a long term social

10:34.640 --> 10:37.600
and economic impact, and
they have already sparked

10:37.680 --> 10:40.680
spinoffs of crimes and
further victimization.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.640
I had quite a few of the gentlemen
that I had met and talked to

10:44.720 --> 10:50.040
their wives were decimated and hurt

10:50.120 --> 10:52.520
and they wanted to talk.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.640
As of this morning we have two
unconfirmed reports

10:56.720 --> 10:59.880
of suicides associated
because of the leak

10:59.960 --> 11:02.960
of Ashley Madison's customers profiles.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.800
<i>This being covered as if</i>
<i>the CIA had been hacked.</i>

11:05.960 --> 11:09.200
What is so interesting here is that
somebody would want to do this.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.720
<i>...there's lipstick. Who is she?</i>

11:12.040 --> 11:15.600
<i>Many celebrities,</i>
<i>politicians, religious leaders</i>

11:15.680 --> 11:18.760
<i>and military personnel were</i>
<i>reported to be members.</i>

11:18.840 --> 11:20.720
<i>Just tell me her name, you</i>
<i>might as well tell me.</i>

11:20.920 --> 11:22.720
<i>This was brought to</i>
<i>wife's attention.</i>

11:22.800 --> 11:26.400
<i>She has forgiven me for this</i>
<i>mistake that I've made.</i>

11:26.480 --> 11:29.120
<i>I've sought forgiveness to God</i>
<i>and he's forgiven me</i>

11:29.200 --> 11:31.120
<i>so I've been completely</i>
<i>cleansed of this sin.</i>

11:33.280 --> 11:36.640
<i>After the frenzy</i>
<i>around user identities had died down,</i>

11:36.720 --> 11:40.160
<i>the media turned its attention</i>
<i>to the business itself.</i>

11:41.640 --> 11:46.160
<i>It became obvious that Avid Life Media</i>
<i>profited from a wide range of websites.</i>

11:48.680 --> 11:51.680
<i>And not all of them</i>
<i>were dating services.</i>

11:58.240 --> 12:02.320
<i>Ashley Madison's meteoric</i>
<i>rise continued unabated</i>

12:02.400 --> 12:08.240
<i>and by 2015 they claimed to</i>
<i>have over 30 million users.</i>

12:08.720 --> 12:11.520
-Alex.

12:11.720 --> 12:15.480
<i>They even launched their very</i>
<i>own Affair Anywhere mobile app</i>

12:15.560 --> 12:18.480
<i>and brazenly spread the</i>
<i>word around the globe.</i>

12:24.600 --> 12:29.960
<i>But on the 19th July the site was</i>
<i>hacked with catastrophic effects.</i>

12:30.240 --> 12:34.000
<i>It would become one of the largest</i>
<i>cyber breaches of all time.</i>

12:34.080 --> 12:36.560
Multiple sites are
now being downloaded

12:36.680 --> 12:39.920
nobody is going to be able
to erase that information.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.240
<i>But despite the sensitivity</i>
<i>of the website,</i>

12:42.320 --> 12:43.280
<i>we now know that</i>

12:43.360 --> 12:46.000
<i>Ashley Madison was warned</i>
<i>of security vulnerabilities</i>

12:46.080 --> 12:49.720
<i>a number of times before</i>
<i>the 2015 scandal.</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:58.880
<i>The Philippines has become an</i>
<i>unlikely global cyber hotspot.</i>

13:00.200 --> 13:02.640
<i>Jayson Zabate is a</i>
<i>Filipino hacker.</i>

13:03.400 --> 13:05.640
<i>He managed to infiltrate</i>
<i>the website in the months</i>

13:05.720 --> 13:09.320
<i>before the disastrous</i>
<i>hack of July 2015.</i>

13:10.240 --> 13:14.880
Just checking Ashley Madison
website.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.120
I try to hack it.

13:17.240 --> 13:22.160
I check the code and find
what is the flaw or the weaknesses.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.640
<i>Jayson is part of an international</i>
<i>community of cyber bounty hunters</i>

13:26.720 --> 13:28.520
<i>known as white hat hackers.</i>

13:28.600 --> 13:33.440
My job is to help keep companies secure.
I don't want to be a black hat.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.040
I am not a bad guy.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.240
<i>These hackers can make a</i>
<i>lot of money by showing</i>

13:38.320 --> 13:41.200
<i>large companies where their</i>
<i>vulnerabilities lie.</i>

13:44.040 --> 13:46.360
<i>Jayson pays his</i>
<i>university fees this way.</i>

13:49.120 --> 13:52.120
<i>He found a way into</i>
<i>Ashley Madison relatively quickly.</i>

13:52.280 --> 13:57.600
I have found cross-site scripting and
bypassing cross-site request forgery.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.600
That will allow an attacker
to change profile details.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.920
<i>Jayson told Avid Life Media</i>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.720
<i>he had managed to find a</i>
<i>flaw in their security</i>

14:06.800 --> 14:09.480
<i>and they paid him a small fee</i>
<i>in return for information.</i>

14:09.560 --> 14:11.000
<i>But it was too late.</i>

14:11.800 --> 14:14.120
<i>The Impact Team of hackers had</i>
<i>apparently been accessing</i>

14:14.200 --> 14:17.080
<i>the site for a long time</i>
<i>before Jayson got there.</i>

14:17.200 --> 14:20.920
<i>Impact Team claims they</i>
<i>had been watching the site grow</i>

14:21.000 --> 14:24.480
for some time to the tens
of millions of users.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.240
And they said they wanted to stop
the next 60 million customers.

14:27.320 --> 14:32.400
They likened Avid Life Media to
a drug dealer abusing addicts.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.520
<i>Joseph Cox believes</i>
<i>he is the only journalist</i>

14:35.600 --> 14:38.600
<i>to have had contact with the</i>
<i>Impact hackers themselves.</i>

14:38.800 --> 14:43.200
Impact Team said when they hacked
Ashley Madison no one was watching.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.400
As in there were very few
security barriers

14:46.480 --> 14:48.480
to getting into the network
and they also said

14:48.560 --> 14:51.880
it was possible to hop from
different parts of the network

14:51.960 --> 14:53.880
with a very simple password.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.560
<i>And this had been in the</i>
<i>work for some time.</i>

14:56.880 --> 14:59.760
<i>They said that they had</i>
<i>been exfiltrating the data</i>

14:59.840 --> 15:01.320
<i>over a number of years.</i>

15:02.160 --> 15:05.360
<i>Ashley Madison talked</i>
<i>a good game about their security</i>

15:05.440 --> 15:09.120
but as we've seen security was not
at the top of their agenda,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.200
what was at the top of their
agenda was making money.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.720
<i>Jeremy Bullock is a data analyst</i>

15:13.800 --> 15:16.320
<i>who used the information</i>
<i>released in the hack to analyze</i>

15:16.400 --> 15:18.240
<i>Ashley Madison's business practices.</i>

15:19.040 --> 15:23.080
<i>He was one of the first to identify</i>
<i>the company's use of fembots.</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:26.120
<i>When he looked at the</i>
<i>email addresses of users,</i>

15:26.200 --> 15:29.040
<i>he discovered 837 individual members</i>

15:29.120 --> 15:31.120
<i>that all shared</i>
<i>the same email address.</i>

15:32.440 --> 15:34.320
<i>These seemed to be fake profiles</i>

15:34.400 --> 15:36.400
<i>who were programmed</i>
<i>to contact real users.</i>

15:38.200 --> 15:41.720
<i>They have also been called</i>
<i>engagers or iconians.</i>

15:41.880 --> 15:44.240
These were algorithms
that enabled

15:44.320 --> 15:48.520
Ashley Madison
to contact gullible men

15:48.600 --> 15:52.040
and pretend to
be available women

15:52.120 --> 15:53.840
and made them part with money.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.000
<i>Iconians would send</i>
<i>messages to users of the site.</i>

15:58.080 --> 16:01.800
<i>In order for men to chat</i>
<i>back they would have to pay.</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:07.120
Why 837 rather than 80,000?
Because they didn't need 80,000.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.600
<i>You could move these 837 around,</i>
<i>you could make them different.</i>

16:10.680 --> 16:12.160
<i>They were programs now,</i>

16:12.240 --> 16:15.440
<i>they didn't have to be manually</i>
<i>manipulated.</i>

16:15.520 --> 16:17.080
Very very clever.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.240
They made it sound like it was this
play land of people hooking up

16:23.320 --> 16:26.240
<i>and there's millions</i>
<i>of women here</i>

16:26.320 --> 16:28.240
<i>and they're all</i>
<i>interested in you.</i>

16:28.320 --> 16:33.880
I had contact with probably
around 200 profiles

16:33.960 --> 16:38.040
and out of that I believe I spoke
with one actual person.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.080
<i>But the idea that bots</i>

16:44.160 --> 16:48.600
<i>and fake profiles were on the pages</i>
<i>of Ashley Madison was not new.</i> <i>As early as 2008</i>
<i>consumer attorney Fillippo Marchino</i>

16:54.240 --> 16:56.720
<i>was preparing a case</i>
<i>against Avid Life Media</i>

16:56.800 --> 16:58.960
<i>on behalf of disgruntled users.</i>

16:59.920 --> 17:02.440
One of the first things we
did is we pulled the terms

17:02.520 --> 17:04.920
and conditions off of the
website of Ashley Madison

17:05.560 --> 17:08.560
and buried in the middle
was a couple of sentences

17:08.640 --> 17:10.839
that read something
to the extent of

17:10.920 --> 17:13.240
"this is only an
entertainment website,

17:13.319 --> 17:17.160
you may be responding
or contacted by robots"

17:17.640 --> 17:20.040
and that just did
not sound right

17:20.119 --> 17:23.520
because people were not
engaging AshleyMadison.com

17:23.880 --> 17:26.599
to talk to robots.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.800
That was not the crux of the idea.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.520
<i>Fillippo then came across</i>
<i>AshleyMadisonSucks.com,</i>

17:33.600 --> 17:36.200
<i>a sounding board for</i>
<i>unhappy customers.</i>

17:36.480 --> 17:38.040
<i>He discovered that</i>
<i>Biderman's company,</i>

17:38.120 --> 17:42.000
<i>Avid Life Media was taking</i>
<i>legal action against the site.</i>

17:42.240 --> 17:47.880
We felt that AshleyMadisonSucks.com
was a rightful forum

17:47.960 --> 17:49.920
for people to voice their opinions

17:50.000 --> 17:55.360
and was in no way violative of
the trademark AshleyMadison.com.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.280
<i>Fillippo agreed to represent the owner</i>

17:57.360 --> 17:59.240
<i>of AshleyMadisonSucks.com.</i>

17:59.400 --> 18:02.640
What happened then is
that things got strange.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.560
<i>The proverbial shit hit</i>
<i>the proverbial fan if you will.</i>

18:08.240 --> 18:11.120
<i>We became the target of</i>
<i>online activities that</i>

18:11.200 --> 18:13.200
<i>couldn't really be</i>
<i>traced back to anybody.</i>

18:13.280 --> 18:18.200
But that were borderline bullying,

18:18.520 --> 18:19.520
if you will.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.080
<i>Suddenly web pages</i>
<i>were created blackmailing</i>

18:22.160 --> 18:25.520
<i>Fillippo's client and threatening him</i>
<i>if he didn't take down</i>

18:25.600 --> 18:27.800
<i>AshleyMadisonSucks.com.</i>

18:28.480 --> 18:30.560
<i>False Things were</i>
<i>written about Fillippo,</i>

18:30.640 --> 18:34.920
<i>his client, family members</i>
<i>and even his employees.</i>

18:35.000 --> 18:37.080
<i>Anonymous emails were</i>
<i>sent with further threats</i>

18:37.160 --> 18:38.920
<i>and untrue allegations:</i>

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
<i>one suggested that</i>
<i>Fillippo's client had HIV.</i>

18:43.240 --> 18:45.560
<i>We were never actually</i>
<i>able to trace back</i>

18:45.640 --> 18:47.840
who these emails
were coming from

18:47.920 --> 18:52.320
but it all started occurring
right at the same time.

18:53.160 --> 18:57.320
<i>It seemed to be a</i>
<i>coordinated attack</i>

18:57.400 --> 19:02.360
to dissuade my client from
proceeding with what he was doing.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.400
<i>In a separate effort</i>
<i>to get the site shut down,</i>

19:05.480 --> 19:08.800
<i>Noel Biderman offered the owner</i>
<i>of AshleyMadisonSucks.com</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:11.040
<i>money for the IP address.</i>

19:11.200 --> 19:14.440
<i>He repeated his demands in a</i>
<i>phone call recorded by the owner</i>

19:14.520 --> 19:17.080
<i>and in the presence</i>
<i>of two witnesses.</i>

19:17.280 --> 19:18.120
<i>Give me the URL back</i>

19:18.200 --> 19:20.200
<i>I offered you ten grand,</i>
<i>you're being an ass.</i>

19:20.720 --> 19:23.480
<i>I'm being a schmuck.</i>
<i>You sent an email to my girlfriend.</i>

19:23.560 --> 19:26.120
<i>You have no idea. Yeah</i>
<i>just wait for the world</i>

19:26.200 --> 19:28.080
<i>of hurt I will bring on you.</i>
<i>Just wait.</i>

19:29.640 --> 19:32.120
I found out on the news
that they'd been hacked

19:32.200 --> 19:35.720
and all their information
had been dumped.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.280
I was very surprised to find
out that some documents

19:39.360 --> 19:42.120
which had been exchanged
between us and them

19:42.200 --> 19:44.120
which otherwise
should have been confidential,

19:44.200 --> 19:45.840
were now public domain.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.360
<i>You email my girlfriend and tell her</i>

19:49.440 --> 19:52.320
<i>that you're putting up a site</i>
<i>about her and she may have HIV.</i>

19:52.400 --> 19:55.400
<i>I'm going to do so</i>
<i>much worse to you.</i>

19:55.480 --> 19:56.880
<i>You're messing with</i>
<i>my livelihood.</i>

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
<i>You choose to be an ass.</i>
<i>I'm being one back</i>

19:59.040 --> 20:01.760
<i>but I can be ten times worse.</i>
<i>I have way more resources than you.</i>

20:01.840 --> 20:04.640
<i>You have 24 hours my friend.</i>
<i>I'm going to drag you through the mud.</i>

20:09.040 --> 20:10.320
<i>The first dump of information</i>

20:10.400 --> 20:12.800
<i>by The Impact Team of hackers</i>
<i>revealed</i>

20:12.880 --> 20:15.240
<i>information about many</i>
<i>users of the site</i>

20:15.320 --> 20:17.520
<i>but the hack didn't end there.</i>

20:17.640 --> 20:20.880
It seemed on the surface
to be cut and dry,

20:20.960 --> 20:23.320
here is a company,
it's been hacked.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.800
Here are all the victims.
There's the story the end.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.920
It should have blown
over, but it didn't.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.360
<i>What came then</i>
<i>took the hack to the next level.</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:36.720
<i>Plenty of data breeches</i>
<i>take customer data,</i>

20:36.800 --> 20:40.880
emails addresses, passwords maybe
some other customer information

20:40.960 --> 20:44.520
<i>and depending on the website</i>
<i>that can be relatively easy.</i>

20:44.600 --> 20:47.200
But to get emails,
product source-code,

20:47.280 --> 20:51.840
internal documents, the hacker really
has to take several more steps

20:51.920 --> 20:54.560
and really penetrate
a company's network.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.880
<i>The second dump</i>
<i>of information related to the company</i>

20:57.960 --> 21:00.120
<i>and the CEO himself.</i>

21:00.200 --> 21:02.520
There was so much email.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.120
I mean it was every
email from 2011,

21:06.200 --> 21:09.240
2012 all the way till June 2015.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.400
A lot of email.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.920
I'm totally guessing here but what

21:13.000 --> 21:14.480
it looked like
somebody had thrown

21:14.560 --> 21:16.760
a USB stick in
someone's computers

21:16.840 --> 21:19.120
and just dragged
over email files.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.920
I looked less like a
hack than a copy.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.520
Not all data breaches
become public, I mean

21:26.600 --> 21:29.080
probably most of them
don't become public.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.320
But the fact that
anybody can log on

21:31.400 --> 21:33.240
to a website on the
so called dark web,

21:33.320 --> 21:36.400
download this data and
see it for themselves...

21:36.480 --> 21:37.960
<i>I mean that's appealing.</i>

21:38.200 --> 21:40.480
<i>I start looking through</i>
<i>the emails because...</i>

21:40.560 --> 21:42.200
<i>I was interested in seeing if</i>

21:42.280 --> 21:44.160
<i>I could figure out</i>
<i>who would do it.</i>

21:44.640 --> 21:46.720
<i>I wanted to figure</i>
<i>out who did it.</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:51.200
Well, then I became an addict.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.600
<i>But as Gina,</i>
<i>the editor of ANewDomain.com,</i>

21:55.680 --> 21:57.400
<i>looked through the emails</i>

21:57.480 --> 21:59.080
<i>more questions came up.</i>

21:59.160 --> 22:02.200
Soon I was just looking in the
email trying to figure out,

22:02.600 --> 22:04.320
what was Ashley Madison?

22:04.520 --> 22:07.320
Was it really a dating site?
It didn't appear so.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.440
<i>Avid Life Media</i>

22:09.520 --> 22:11.200
<i>the parent company</i>
<i>of Ashley Madison,</i>

22:11.280 --> 22:14.280
<i>and headed by Noel Biderman</i>
<i>owned a lot of different websites</i>

22:14.360 --> 22:16.880
<i>through many different</i>
<i>shell companies.</i>

22:17.000 --> 22:19.240
<i>Some of these like Established</i>
<i>Men and Cougar Life</i>

22:19.320 --> 22:21.280
<i>were publicly part</i>
<i>of the portfolio,</i>

22:21.720 --> 22:25.440
<i>and some of them weren't so obviously</i>
<i>linked to Avid Life Media.</i>

22:26.200 --> 22:32.440
It isn't one dating site, it's many sites
in every major market in the world.

22:32.520 --> 22:38.320
It's really a sprawling business and
a sprawling collection of websites

22:38.400 --> 22:42.040
that appear to be designed
to get people to come in

22:42.120 --> 22:43.800
to do other stuff.

22:43.880 --> 22:47.520
And that stuff doesn't seem to
have a lot to do with dating.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.080
<i>The company owned websites</i>

22:50.160 --> 22:53.520
<i>that seemed to cater for every</i>
<i>conceivable male fantasy.</i>

22:54.200 --> 22:57.680
<i>Each one was slick and</i>
<i>targeted at a specific market.</i>

22:58.920 --> 23:02.280
So yes there's married women
that will have an affair with you,

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
that's Ashley Madison.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.120
There's older women who will
have an affair with younger guys

23:06.200 --> 23:08.440
that's Cougar Life.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.120
<i>Broke College Girls,</i>
<i>find a broke college girl</i>

23:11.200 --> 23:13.040
<i>and maybe you could</i>
<i>be her sugar daddy.</i>

23:13.120 --> 23:18.040
<i>There's that site. There's bondage</i>
<i>sites, there's gay sites,</i>

23:18.120 --> 23:22.120
if you can find a male fantasy,
there's a site for it.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.880
<i>All the websites had</i>
<i>one aim: to draw in male customers.</i>

23:30.280 --> 23:32.480
<i>Ashley Madison user</i>
<i>Tamsin could see how</i>

23:32.560 --> 23:34.560
<i>people got drawn</i>
<i>onto other websites.</i>

23:34.960 --> 23:37.400
I think it's become a
sort of a gateway drug,

23:37.480 --> 23:41.080
if you will, for
relationships and websites,

23:41.160 --> 23:46.720
and Internet dating of this
sort, that it's a good area

23:46.800 --> 23:50.080
and a good site for people
to get their feet wet,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.480
and then once they're
there, then the banners

23:52.560 --> 23:55.320
for the more sort of
directed websites pop up.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.480
<i>One of Avid Life's</i>
<i>most popular websites</i>

23:58.560 --> 24:00.200
<i>was Established Men.</i>

24:00.600 --> 24:03.840
<i>It claims to be the premier</i>
<i>online dating service that</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
<i>connects young, beautiful women</i>
<i>with rich, successful men!</i>

24:08.000 --> 24:10.440
<i>The website makes it clear</i>
<i>women cannot advertise</i>

24:10.520 --> 24:12.000
<i>their services as an escort</i>

24:12.080 --> 24:14.960
<i>however many female users</i>
<i>are looking for</i>

24:15.040 --> 24:18.360
<i>''a mutually beneficial arrangement'',</i>
<i>an MBA</i>

24:19.040 --> 24:23.200
<i>a common online term for a</i>
<i>relationship often involving money.</i>

24:25.200 --> 24:27.520
<i>A lot of times women are</i>
<i>looking for arrangements</i>

24:27.600 --> 24:30.080
<i>because they're having</i>
<i>difficulty making ends meet.</i>

24:30.800 --> 24:33.480
<i>And a lot of times men</i>
<i>are not in a position</i>

24:33.560 --> 24:38.240
to have a formal relationship
with all the bells and whistles

24:38.320 --> 24:41.320
and responsibilities
that go along with it.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.320
<i>Marketing Consultant</i>
<i>Tamsin has lived</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:46.600
<i>an arrangement lifestyle on and off</i>
<i>since she was 19.</i>

24:46.840 --> 24:50.120
This is more of a situation
where the man provides the woman

24:50.240 --> 24:55.000
with an allowance, spoiling,
takes care of her travel expenses.

24:55.080 --> 25:00.440
<i>Enables her basically to be able to be</i>
<i>on his schedule on an as needed basis.</i>

25:01.080 --> 25:02.600
<i>Like the term sugar-daddy,</i>

25:02.680 --> 25:05.200
<i>a mutually beneficial</i>
<i>arrangement, is a relationship</i>

25:05.280 --> 25:07.920
<i>where men and women</i>
<i>negotiate the terms.</i>

25:09.160 --> 25:13.600
A lot of those are escorts.
Some of them just boldly say "escorts".

25:13.680 --> 25:15.400
But...

25:15.480 --> 25:19.640
Escort services are illegal in the US
outside of a couple of areas

25:19.720 --> 25:21.920
so you can't really come out and say:

25:22.000 --> 25:26.680
"Hey, I'm a hooker!"
You know, it's illegal.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.200
<i>Avid Life Media also</i>
<i>owns ArrangementFinders.com,</i>

25:32.280 --> 25:34.440
<i>a more blatantly erotic website.</i>

25:35.160 --> 25:36.480
<i>Even though the website states</i>

25:36.560 --> 25:38.800
<i>that it doesn't allow escorts</i>
<i>to use their service,</i>

25:38.960 --> 25:40.440
<i>they actively encouraged girls</i>

25:40.520 --> 25:43.440
<i>who would like some extra</i>
<i>income through dating to join.</i>

25:44.120 --> 25:46.440
Start dating the way
evolution programmed you to

25:46.520 --> 25:48.040
and we can ship
bubbles right to you.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.040
<i>They created another</i>
<i>tongue-in-cheek marketing campaign,</i>

25:51.120 --> 25:54.880
<i>this time with the porn star Kayden</i>
<i>Kross as the face of the brand.</i>

25:55.280 --> 25:56.840
We're not just
creating arrangements,

25:56.920 --> 25:57.880
we are also creating new jobs.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.160
-No jobs.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.160
-Blow jobs.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.760
<i>When they deliberately</i>
<i>advertised outside a university</i>

26:05.840 --> 26:09.000
<i>they made the news again.</i>
<i>People were stunned.</i>

26:09.080 --> 26:11.400
I'm here along Santa Monica
Boulevard near Overland Avenue.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.360
<i>A spokesperson for Avid Life</i>
<i>Media said the placement</i>

26:14.440 --> 26:17.400
<i>and timing of the ad is part</i>
<i>of the company's strategy.</i>

26:17.480 --> 26:19.480
<i>With graduation right</i>
<i>around the corner</i>

26:19.560 --> 26:21.600
<i>and students looking</i>
<i>for jobs and money.</i>

26:21.680 --> 26:23.840
<i>When we asked if this</i>
<i>was prostitution</i>

26:23.920 --> 26:27.080
the spokesperson said, "No,
it's intimacy with a twist."

26:29.440 --> 26:30.920
But emails in the dump

26:31.000 --> 26:32.920
<i>purporting to be</i>
<i>from Noel Biderman's inbox</i>

26:33.000 --> 26:35.880
<i>reveal that the company not</i>
<i>only knew they hosted escorts,</i>

26:35.960 --> 26:38.280
<i>they actively sought them.</i>

26:40.040 --> 26:44.320
<i>In one case it appeared that 2,500</i>
<i>escorts were emailed enticing them</i>

26:44.400 --> 26:46.320
<i>to join Arrangement Finders.</i>

26:47.400 --> 26:51.280
<i>When it worked they planned</i>
<i>to contact 45,000 more.</i>

26:52.960 --> 26:56.360
<i>Some emails discussed the possibility</i>
<i>of bringing foreign women to the US</i>

26:56.440 --> 26:58.040
<i>to work as sugar babies.</i>

27:01.880 --> 27:04.440
<i>And how the company</i>
<i>would market them.</i>

27:07.600 --> 27:10.360
<i>They also investigated how the women</i>
<i>could come to the US</i>

27:10.440 --> 27:12.280
<i>by lying to the authorities.</i>

27:17.440 --> 27:18.960
<i>ArrangementFinders.com</i>

27:19.080 --> 27:21.840
<i>is one of Avid Life's</i>
<i>most successful sites.</i>

27:22.200 --> 27:23.760
<i>And it was to take Noel Biderman</i>

27:23.840 --> 27:27.880
<i>and Avid Life Media</i>
<i>in a new direction: movies.</i>

27:28.920 --> 27:30.760
<i>He experimented with</i>
<i>product placement</i>

27:30.840 --> 27:33.080
<i>and an unknown starlet.</i>

27:33.160 --> 27:35.880
<i>It just happened to</i>
<i>be in hardcore porn.</i>

27:37.400 --> 27:39.320
<i>The site is also known for its shocking,</i>

27:39.400 --> 27:41.880
<i>deliberately provocative</i>
<i>marketing stunts.</i>

27:42.920 --> 27:47.280
<i>This ad from 2013 featuring zombie</i>
<i>husbands and wives was banned</i>

27:47.360 --> 27:50.400
buying the company even
more free publicity.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.840
<i>But the owners of Ashley Madison,</i>
<i>Avid Life Media,</i>

27:55.920 --> 27:57.440
<i>have a loose definition of dating.</i>

27:57.520 --> 27:59.240
It's so simple a
caveman could use it.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
<i>In their deliberately</i>
<i>lo-fi styled advert</i>

28:01.440 --> 28:03.040
<i>for ArrangementFinders.com</i>

28:03.120 --> 28:06.800
<i>Kayden Kross, the face of the</i>
<i>brand, explains what they do.</i>

28:07.200 --> 28:09.640
It's a dating site for all you
sexy silver backs out there

28:09.720 --> 28:11.480
who think it's time for
a little arm candy.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.360
And for all you arm candy to
get a bit of purse candy.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.880
Are these dating options
any good you ask?

28:18.200 --> 28:21.680
No.
But blowjobs are f**king great.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.040
<i>The company has denied</i>
<i>this is prostitution,</i>

28:24.120 --> 28:26.320
<i>but rather intimacy</i>
<i>with a twist.</i>

28:27.200 --> 28:30.440
<i>ArrangementFinders.com is interesting</i>
<i>for an additional reason:</i>

28:30.800 --> 28:33.440
<i>this is the website that</i>
<i>took the CEO Noel Biderman</i>

28:33.520 --> 28:36.360
<i>and his team into the</i>
<i>world of pornography.</i>

28:44.400 --> 28:51.120
I took some photos of myself in a state
of undress in a bank on Wall Street.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.720
<i>And then the photos went viral.</i>

28:54.720 --> 28:57.760
<i>The bathroom was not a public</i>
<i>it was a private bathroom</i>

28:57.840 --> 29:01.400
and I used to take pictures in
there when I was bored anyway

29:01.480 --> 29:04.240
just cause I'm a millennial
and we do things like that.

29:05.360 --> 29:11.320
And within days, literally days, they
went completely viral over the Internet.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.960
And I was dubbed
"The Wall Street porn star"

29:14.040 --> 29:17.640
before I even decided
if I wanted to do porn or not.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.400
But at that point I was committed right?

29:23.160 --> 29:25.280
You've got that Ashley
Madison investment right?

29:25.680 --> 29:29.080
Yeah, and we're working on
some other interesting stuff.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.040
<i>Veronica Vain would</i>
<i>become Noel Biderman's leading lady.</i>

29:33.200 --> 29:34.640
<i>Screwing Wall Street,</i>

29:34.720 --> 29:38.760
<i>the Arrangement Finders IPO was the</i>
<i>first fully-branded porn film,</i>

29:38.840 --> 29:41.280
<i>full of not-so-subtle</i>
<i>product placement.</i>

29:42.600 --> 29:45.600
<i>Veronica was offered the</i>
<i>lead part as her porn debut.</i>

29:45.880 --> 29:49.320
<i>The story was a spoof of the</i>
<i>original Hollywood film Wall Street.</i>

29:49.960 --> 29:51.520
You wanna work with me?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.520
<i>The reason I was really</i>
<i>interested in this deal</i>

29:54.600 --> 29:56.760
I knew that it was
pretty groundbreaking

29:56.840 --> 29:58.000
what they were doing.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.880
Even if it wasn't necessarily the
best way to go about it at the time,

30:02.080 --> 30:03.520
the fact that they were doing it

30:03.600 --> 30:05.160
and that they were a
mainstream brand.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.160
You were good enough
to get in my office.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.920
Let's see it you're
good enough to stay.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.040
<i>That movie wasn't really</i>
<i>the gold mine for him,</i>

30:15.120 --> 30:18.360
he wasn't just looking for
his brand to be in porn.

30:18.440 --> 30:21.120
Just the fact that
it was my name

30:21.200 --> 30:25.840
and I was this girl who was being
portrayed as being young and cute

30:25.920 --> 30:27.320
and having a good
head on her shoulders.

30:27.680 --> 30:32.000
<i>I was the girl he wanted</i>
<i>to sell to all these guys.</i>

30:32.200 --> 30:33.920
<i>The plan worked very well.</i>

30:34.000 --> 30:37.920
<i>The clips that were released for free</i>
<i>have had over three million views</i>

30:38.000 --> 30:40.160
<i>but it was Veronica's</i>
<i>association with the brand</i>

30:40.240 --> 30:42.200
<i>and appearances on</i>
<i>legitimate news channels</i>

30:42.280 --> 30:43.600
<i>that really had an effect.</i>

30:43.680 --> 30:45.080
<i>I always wanted to do something</i>

30:45.160 --> 30:46.400
<i>more entrepreneurial with my career</i>

30:46.480 --> 30:49.120
<i>I knew I wasn't fit for a</i>
<i>more conservative environment</i>

30:49.200 --> 30:51.880
<i>and I saw an industry that's undergoing</i>
<i>a new wave of innovation</i>

30:51.960 --> 30:53.640
<i>and I really wanted</i>
<i>to be a part of it.</i>

30:53.720 --> 30:58.560
The site had 200 per cent
increase in overall web traffic

30:58.640 --> 31:04.320
but more impressively a 400
per cent increase in signups.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.960
Which I think it's basically saying that
if you were going to Arrangement Finders

31:08.040 --> 31:12.160
as a result of seeing me in this clip
or in the media or something

31:12.240 --> 31:14.680
you're almost immediately
converting into a member.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.400
<i>It was another major</i>
<i>marketing success for Noel Biderman.</i>

31:18.560 --> 31:21.120
<i>Why do you think Noel</i>
<i>was so clever at this?</i>

31:21.200 --> 31:24.720
Speaking as an entrepreneur
myself most entrepreneurs

31:24.800 --> 31:25.840
when they come up with an idea

31:25.920 --> 31:28.600
it's because they saw a market need
for something that they needed.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.360
Most entrepreneurs
won't just like:

31:30.440 --> 31:32.320
"Oh, people need this but
I don't really want it."

31:32.400 --> 31:34.640
Most entrepreneurs when
they start something

31:34.720 --> 31:36.880
they want the product that's
why they are making it.

31:36.960 --> 31:42.880
So I can only imagine that he might have
wanted to have some sort of affair,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.400
or make it easier
to have affairs.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.640
And that's quite brilliant that he went
to the market

31:46.720 --> 31:47.920
being like ''I don't have affair,

31:48.000 --> 31:52.040
I'm happily married blah blah, I just
like start this for other guys.''

31:52.120 --> 31:55.520
If your husband was
cheating on you,

31:55.640 --> 31:58.600
would you be OK with him going
to a site such as yours?

31:58.680 --> 32:01.120
Absolutely not, that's not
what I signed up for.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.600
<i>Noel was the master</i>
<i>of press interviews.</i>

32:03.680 --> 32:05.840
<i>He often included his</i>
<i>wife in the discussion.</i>

32:05.920 --> 32:09.600
And I live in a traditional
situation with Noel and...

32:09.800 --> 32:13.920
<i>And he was always clear: he had</i>
<i>never had an extra-marital affair.</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:16.240
And I would be devastated
if he did this to me.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.880
<i>But information released</i>
<i>in the Ashley Madison hack</i>

32:18.960 --> 32:21.520
<i>revealed that Noel</i>
<i>did have affairs,</i>

32:21.680 --> 32:23.920
<i>in fact, it appeared</i>
<i>that over three years</i>

32:24.000 --> 32:26.280
<i>he had had relationships</i>
<i>with a number of women,</i>

32:26.360 --> 32:30.160
<i>many of whom he had met through</i>
<i>his own site, Established Men.</i>

32:31.480 --> 32:33.560
<i>Noel frequently discussed</i>
<i>money with these women</i>

32:33.640 --> 32:36.200
<i>and even offered one</i>
<i>work at Avid Life.</i>

32:36.680 --> 32:40.480
<i>He appears to have been</i>
<i>a serial sugar daddy himself.</i>

32:41.680 --> 32:45.920
<i>It seems that very little of the Ashley</i>
<i>Madison story was as it appeared.</i>

32:46.840 --> 32:49.240
<i>It's hard to know if the mainstream</i>
<i>media would have given Noel</i>

32:49.320 --> 32:51.480
<i>and his company quite</i>
<i>so much airtime</i>

32:51.560 --> 32:55.040
<i>if they'd known all that was</i>
<i>happening behind the scenes.</i>

32:55.840 --> 32:58.760
<i>I don't think Ashley Madison</i>
<i>is inventing prostitution.</i>

32:58.840 --> 33:05.120
I think what the emails suggest they're
doing is helping to automate it.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.280
And making it very easy.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.480
Just like Google didn't
invent looking stuff up.

33:10.560 --> 33:14.280
<i>To my knowledge, Ashley Madison,</i>
<i>they're not running a prostitution ring</i>

33:14.360 --> 33:18.800
<i>or their own escort service that's</i>
<i>against the law or anything like that.</i>

33:18.880 --> 33:21.960
What I find more immoral
is about the way

33:22.040 --> 33:25.320
they deal with reporters
and journalists,

33:25.400 --> 33:28.920
misleading them into thinking that the
company is something that it isn't.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.280
But that's not illegal either.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
Because they're
a private company

33:33.600 --> 33:36.520
and they can tell people anything
they want to about their business.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.000
I think Ashley Madison were
brilliant at marketing

33:39.080 --> 33:42.080
they seemed to know
what the papers wanted.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.600
And they would take this
little seed of truth,

33:45.680 --> 33:49.800
blow it up and that was probably what
made them so successful in the media.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.840
You need to get a little bit more
with times, and to be honest...

<i>Louise Van der Veld</i>

34:00.600 --> 34:03.360
<i>although she soon fell out</i>

34:03.440 --> 34:06.520
<i>She did get an insight into</i>
<i>how the company worked.</i>

34:06.600 --> 34:10.360
...because the relationship model is
fundamentally flawed from the off.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.400
When I first agreed to
be their spokesperson,

34:13.480 --> 34:16.120
it was very much me coming from
an authentic point of view,

34:16.199 --> 34:20.320
about my beliefs about my experience of
working with couples who had affairs.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.440
A lot of that kind of got ditched

34:22.520 --> 34:27.880
and they totally glamorized it
with a shocking headline approach.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.080
<i>And the hacked emails</i>
<i>revealed not just exaggeration,</i>

34:31.159 --> 34:33.320

34:43.320 --> 34:46.840

34:58.600 --> 35:02.080
<i>who was trying to get a piece</i>
<i>commissioned by the magazine.</i>

35:03.640 --> 35:08.280
Forbes editors had agreed
to do an article about them

35:08.360 --> 35:11.880
and their fantastic growth but
they wanted to see some numbers.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.960
And from the trail of emails
you see employees saying,

35:16.040 --> 35:22.480
woah I can do up this chart and I
can make up this set of data points

35:22.560 --> 35:25.480
a lot of it seems to
be largely invented.

35:26.280 --> 35:29.040
<i>The company appears</i>
<i>to have dramatically exaggerated</i>

35:29.120 --> 35:32.280
<i>the financial figures for</i>
<i>the Ashley Madison website.</i>

35:33.200 --> 35:36.960
All those websites, all those
affiliate marketing deals.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.760
All the many different
little revenue streams

35:39.840 --> 35:41.600
that Ashley Madison and Avid

35:41.680 --> 35:44.760
and its related companies
have all over the world.

35:44.840 --> 35:49.840
But how could Forbes have known about
all of that? And back then nobody did.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.600
<i>Noel's dream was for Ashely Madison</i>

35:52.680 --> 35:54.320
<i>to be listed on the stock market</i>

35:54.400 --> 35:58.560
<i>and sell its shares to the public through</i>
<i>what's called an IPO.</i>

35:59.200 --> 36:02.920
We're a huge company. Maybe
you can help us with the IPO,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.840
I think it's about time we go and raise
a billion bucks and show the world.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.040
That's interesting!

36:07.120 --> 36:09.760
It could happen. If you looked at our
business with a blind on it right?

36:09.840 --> 36:11.000
You just looked at
the numbers and

36:11.080 --> 36:12.600
the growth and the membership
and you go oh my God

36:12.680 --> 36:13.760
this thing is worth billions...

36:13.840 --> 36:15.840
<i>Noel wanted everyone</i>
<i>to look at the business</i>

36:15.920 --> 36:20.440
<i>through a filter. To cover the entire</i>
<i>empire of sex sites, porn affiliates</i>

36:20.520 --> 36:23.360
<i>and escort listings with the</i>
<i>blanket of Ashley Madison.</i>

36:23.600 --> 36:28.200
Because Noel was so good at
making it look mainstream and OK,

36:28.280 --> 36:31.000
and commonplace and
OK to talk about,

36:31.080 --> 36:34.440
I think people were more likely
to be able to talk openly

36:34.520 --> 36:37.600
about AshleyMadison.com
than they are about PornHub.com.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.360
So if Forbes comes out and says: ''Wow! Ashley Madison
is one of the largest,

36:43.200 --> 36:46.040
most successful dating sites in history,

36:46.120 --> 36:51.120
it's nearly a billion-dollar company
then 8 other major publications

36:51.200 --> 36:54.560
the world over will say ''Wow! Forbes,
Bloomberg, it must be true.''

36:54.640 --> 36:57.120
I mean with nobody
really questioning,

36:57.200 --> 37:01.520
could this really be a billion-dollar
company

37:01.600 --> 37:04.000
<i>45 per cent growth in one year really?</i>

37:04.080 --> 37:09.480
You really can't blame Ashley Madison
for taking advantage of a lazy press.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.080
<i>In September 2015,</i>
<i>two months after the hack,</i>

37:13.360 --> 37:15.280
<i>another Forbes</i>
<i>article was written:</i>

37:15.840 --> 37:19.840
<i>"We really don't know how big Ashley</i>
<i>Madison was, although I'm pretty sure</i>

37:19.920 --> 37:22.760
<i>that it was nowhere near</i>
<i>as big as it seemed."</i>

37:23.680 --> 37:25.960
<i>But while the hack appears</i>
<i>to have revealed so much</i>

37:26.040 --> 37:28.120
<i>about the users and</i>
<i>owners of the website,</i>

37:28.200 --> 37:31.120
<i>we know very little about</i>
<i>the hackers themselves.</i>

37:31.200 --> 37:34.280
<i>A year later no one has</i>
<i>been arrested for the crime</i>

37:34.360 --> 37:36.560
<i>and the case is still ongoing.</i>

37:36.800 --> 37:40.800
Avid Life Media is offering
a 500,000 dollar reward

37:40.880 --> 37:45.280
to anyone providing information
that leads to the identification,

37:45.360 --> 37:48.520
arrest and prosecution
of the person or persons

37:48.600 --> 37:51.480
responsible for the leak of
the Ashley Madison database.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.440
<i>And no one has collected</i>
<i>that half a million-dollar reward.</i>

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
<i>Standby.</i>

37:56.800 --> 37:58.840
<i>Good looking, healthy,</i>

37:58.920 --> 38:02.160
<i>certainly old enough to get married,</i>
<i>what a lovely picture</i>

38:02.240 --> 38:06.280
<i>this bride and groom make each</i>
<i>is a dream in the others mind.</i>

38:07.160 --> 38:08.400
<i>Many marriages were rocked</i>

38:08.480 --> 38:10.880
<i>when the user details</i>
<i>of AshleyMadison.com</i>

38:10.960 --> 38:14.080
<i>were leaked last year.</i>
<i>Divorce lawyers claimed</i>

38:14.160 --> 38:17.000
<i>it was Christmas in September</i>
<i>for the industry.</i>

38:17.080 --> 38:20.120
<i>Why does it have to</i>
<i>happen this way for them?</i>

38:20.880 --> 38:22.120
<i>Whose fault was it?</i>

38:25.040 --> 38:27.000
<i>The dating industry was also rocked.</i>

38:27.080 --> 38:30.600
<i>Shortly after the hacked emails</i>
<i>of Noel Biderman were published,</i>

38:30.680 --> 38:34.720
<i>Avid Life Media announced that he</i>
<i>had agreed to step down as CEO.</i>

38:35.200 --> 38:38.040
<i>They said this was in the best</i>
<i>interests of the company.</i>

38:39.320 --> 38:42.480
Team Impact, this is
your wake up call.

38:42.560 --> 38:46.480
Your actions are illegal
and will not be tolerated.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.800
<i>But the police still</i>
<i>have no idea who did it.</i>

38:50.200 --> 38:52.520
<i>The hackers called</i>
<i>themselves The Impact Team,</i>

38:52.600 --> 38:54.080
<i>an anonymous-style group</i>

38:54.160 --> 38:57.280
<i>who called the users of Ashley</i>
<i>Madison cheating dirt bags</i>

38:57.360 --> 39:00.760
<i>and accused Avid Life of profiting</i>
<i>from the pain of others.</i>

39:01.200 --> 39:04.000
<i>This kind of hack is</i>
<i>known as hacktivism.</i>

39:11.080 --> 39:16.240
<i>Hacker house near Manchester, is filled</i>
<i>with people who know that world.</i>

39:17.120 --> 39:21.400
If you understand the rules of somebody
else's system better than they do,

39:21.480 --> 39:24.640
then you effectively get to
rewrite the rules of the game.

39:25.480 --> 39:29.560
Trying to take down a website that
promotes unfaithfulness between couples.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.280
It could be considered
vigilantism.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.880
Is it ok to cheat on your wife?

39:33.960 --> 39:37.520
Because you can do it behind
closed doors on this website,

39:37.600 --> 39:39.840
and then what happens
when that is exposed?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.440
Are we all now supposed
to feel sorry for you?

39:41.560 --> 39:43.880
I personally would never
do anything illegal,

39:43.960 --> 39:48.080
but when the Ashley Madison
thing happened it was like

39:48.160 --> 39:49.280
yeah good on them!

39:49.360 --> 39:52.040
A lot of big hacktivists, I
mean this is what they go for,

39:52.120 --> 39:55.400
they try to expose big
corporate companies.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.720
The means of going in and
shutting down some other site,

39:58.920 --> 40:00.160
it's still breaking the law.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.640
It's getting serious, we're seeing more
the effect it will have on

40:04.720 --> 40:06.200
on people's lives.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.560
<i>Hacker House was set up to try</i>

40:10.640 --> 40:13.640
<i>and bring hackers into the mainstream</i>
<i>and not to break the law.</i>

40:14.360 --> 40:18.200
<i>But The Impact Team's action</i>
<i>was more than just illegal.</i>

40:18.640 --> 40:23.000
Whether they thought the reason
behind it was purely moral,

40:23.080 --> 40:24.360
<i>only they can answer.</i>

40:24.440 --> 40:27.720
But it's not like this was
a victimless crime at all,

40:27.800 --> 40:29.680
I mean people killed themselves.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.560
<i>We still have no idea</i>
<i>who hacked Avid Life Media,</i>

40:33.640 --> 40:35.800
<i>and for what true motive.</i>

40:35.880 --> 40:38.400
<i>They didn't appear to</i>
<i>make money from the hack,</i>

40:38.480 --> 40:40.240
<i>so there must have been</i>
<i>a different reason.</i>

40:40.320 --> 40:42.160
<i>Some people think</i>
<i>it was a competitor</i>

40:42.520 --> 40:47.200
I'm of the belief that it was
probably a competing website.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.200
That may have masterminded
or saw the opportunity.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.960
May have planted an employee
over a period of time.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.680
Or they were the ones that
handled the hack externally.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.720
<i>One theory was that</i>
<i>it was an inside job.</i>

41:03.360 --> 41:08.240
There is chance that the Impact
team was just an insider.

41:08.320 --> 41:11.880
Judging by the quality and
richness of the data.

41:11.960 --> 41:14.240
Internal email,
product source code,

41:14.320 --> 41:18.400
they likely had to be on
the company network itself

41:18.640 --> 41:20.400
rather than just the website.

41:23.840 --> 41:28.240
<i>I believe that someone</i>
<i>had a personal problem with the CEO</i>

41:28.320 --> 41:30.400
<i>or the executives at the company</i>

41:30.480 --> 41:33.200
and felt cheated in some way

41:33.280 --> 41:35.120
where they were getting revenge.

41:35.680 --> 41:38.560
Judging by the way that I
was treated by the company

41:38.640 --> 41:43.040
and the way that they just seemed
used to dealing with employees

41:43.120 --> 41:45.200
that were not happy

41:45.280 --> 41:49.080
I think it possibly was an inside job.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.400
<i>Lots of people could have had a motive</i>

41:52.480 --> 41:57.680
to either harm either Avid in general
or Noel specifically.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.360
People inside, people outside.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.200
This was a company that
sued a lot of people,

42:02.280 --> 42:04.440
fired a lot of people.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.880
Finding a person with
a motive is too easy.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.880
There's too many
people with motives.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.600
<i>But whoever did it,</i>

42:17.680 --> 42:21.160
<i>the real world impact</i>
<i>of Ashley Madison continues.</i>

42:21.240 --> 42:24.240
Anybody who's been
through what I've been through

42:24.320 --> 42:27.040
through would love to
see that site down.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.080
<i>Long before the hack,</i>

42:29.160 --> 42:32.640
<i>Ashley Madison had been</i>
<i>helping to destroy marriages.</i>

42:32.760 --> 42:36.080
<i>Many of the real women on the</i>
<i>site were from rural areas.</i>

42:36.800 --> 42:40.520
When the hack happened you can
actually go and see per area,

42:40.600 --> 42:47.200
Utah, Idaho... where they had some of
the highest Ashley Madison accounts.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.520
<i>And these are conservative,</i>
<i>rural areas.</i>

42:50.600 --> 42:55.880
It's something that actually
is not very surprising to me.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.360
<i>In 2012, several years</i>
<i>before the hack,</i>

43:02.440 --> 43:04.600
<i>Jim received some</i>
<i>messages on his phone.</i>

43:04.680 --> 43:08.320
<i>By accident one of his wife's</i>
<i>accounts was networked to his cell.</i>

43:08.720 --> 43:12.560
I started getting emails
and text messages

43:12.640 --> 43:16.000
between my wife and another guy
telling him "I'm gonna start a
fight with my husband

43:19.520 --> 43:21.880
and figure out some way
to go meet up with you."

43:22.560 --> 43:27.360
I threw up. I actually threw up.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.280
<i>In the end, Jim was able</i>

43:29.400 --> 43:31.960
<i>to recover many</i>
<i>of the messages his wife had sent.</i>

43:32.040 --> 43:35.640
<i>Stuff you can never un-know,</i>
<i>you can never un-see</i>

43:35.720 --> 43:40.440
There was a video. Someone sent me
a video, it was her having sex.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.040
<i>Jim discovered that his wife</i>

43:43.120 --> 43:47.280
<i>had had affairs with six different men</i>
<i>on the Ashley Madison website.</i> It's like a drug, it's
like you're addicted.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.480
You want more, you want that
adrenaline, you want that feeling.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.040
That's the only way
I can think of it.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.320
<i>I have these...</i>

44:00.640 --> 44:01.840
5 little kids.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.920
I did not want them to be raised...

44:06.680 --> 44:08.920
in a broken home.

44:10.800 --> 44:15.880
I felt like it was my fault,
I felt responsible.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.000
<i>I just tried talking to her</i>
<i>and explaining, I love you,</i>

44:20.080 --> 44:24.400
<i>we have 5 kids, let's not</i>
<i>destroy this family.</i>

44:24.760 --> 44:27.800
<i>But in the end it was</i>
<i>impossible to reconcile:</i>

44:27.880 --> 44:30.200
<i>the couple divorced.</i>

44:30.280 --> 44:35.200
It took a long time before I
stopped getting nauseous,

44:35.280 --> 44:40.280
like physically wanted to throw
up any time I saw Ashley Madison.

44:40.360 --> 44:43.400
Until the hack. That was a good day.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.960
<i>We don't know who</i>
<i>did the hack, but we do know that</i>

44:53.040 --> 44:57.080
<i>The Impact Team has threatened</i>
<i>to do more attacks.</i>

44:58.440 --> 45:01.800
I asked the Impact team whether they
were going to hit any other companies

45:01.880 --> 45:04.840
and they said, essentially, sure.

45:04.920 --> 45:07.960
Maybe even politicians.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.960
All systems have weaknesses.

45:12.040 --> 45:16.360
Even the biggest social networking sites.

45:16.440 --> 45:20.040
There is no such thing as a secure system.

45:22.640 --> 45:27.000
<i>As more of our lives become</i>
<i>intertwined with the digital world,</i>

45:27.080 --> 45:30.120

45:30.200 --> 45:32.400
<i>hacking is only going to increase.</i>

45:32.920 --> 45:34.400
<i>Is that scary?</i>
