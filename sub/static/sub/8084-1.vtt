[All Sobbing]

14:03.302 --> 14:08.432
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.852
-The horse is a surprise.
-[Nickers]

14:11.935 --> 14:16.190
Any... regrets?

14:16.315 --> 14:19.818
Besides dying?
Yeah.

14:19.943 --> 14:25.199
I never... had enough... gold.

14:26.450 --> 14:32.080
My regret, besides dying, is...

14:32.206 --> 14:35.667
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,

14:35.792 --> 14:38.795
and no one will even remember us.

14:38.879 --> 14:43.008
Well, if it's
any consolation, Miguel,

14:43.091 --> 14:46.637
you... made my life...

14:46.720 --> 14:48.722
an adventure.
[Sobbing]

14:48.806 --> 14:52.267
And if it's any consolation,
Tulio, [Sniffles]

14:52.351 --> 14:56.355
-you made my life... rich.

It is! It's-It's--
It's-It's-It's--

15:31.056 --> 15:33.433

-Aye!
-Aye! Go!
-[Nickers]

15:49.700 --> 15:53.829
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!

15:55.122 --> 15:57.416
Miguel!
Hello!

15:57.541 --> 15:59.209
Tulio!
We've done it!

15:59.293 --> 16:02.963
-What's that? The map?
-It's all right here!

16:03.046 --> 16:05.799
You still have the map?

16:05.924 --> 16:07.885
The whistling rock!
The stream!

16:07.968 --> 16:10.888
You kept the map, but you couldn't grab
a little more food?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.348
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:

16:13.432 --> 16:16.769
It could be possible.
And it is!

16:16.852 --> 16:21.815
It really is... the map to El Dorado!
[Panting]

16:23.150 --> 16:25.778
-You drank seawater, didn't you?
-Oh, come on!

16:25.903 --> 16:27.780
I'm not coming on!

16:27.905 --> 16:31.408
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle
for a million pesetas!

16:31.533 --> 16:35.996
-How about a hundred million?
-What?

16:36.121 --> 16:39.666
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold--

16:39.792 --> 16:43.170
-What's your point?
-You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,

16:43.253 --> 16:46.131
a temple of gold where you can
pluck gold from the very walls.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.133
But you don't want to go, so let's...

16:48.258 --> 16:50.511
get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.

16:50.636 --> 16:54.139
-After all, it worked so well last time.
-[Gibberish] Wait!

16:54.264 --> 16:57.893
Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.

16:58.018 --> 17:02.439
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,

17:02.564 --> 17:05.526
-and then we go back to Spain.
-And buy Spain!

17:05.608 --> 17:07.569
-Yeah!
-That's the spirit!

17:07.611 --> 17:13.075
-Come on, Tulio.
We'll follow that trail!
-What trail?

17:13.200 --> 17:18.579

And then some

17:50.154 --> 17:53.449
Pioneers of maximum audacity

17:53.574 --> 17:58.370
Whose résumés show
that we are just the team

19:26.625 --> 19:32.506
Through terra incognita
to a golden shrine

No place for the traveler

19:35.968 --> 19:39.638

this temple-robbing thief.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.473

See, the gods sent me a vision...

26:40.267 --> 26:42.978
to bring them tribute
from the temple to guide them here.

[Chuckles]

30:20.821 --> 30:23.491
-Hey!
-Hey. Hey.

30:23.574 --> 30:26.035
-[Laughing]
-[Laughing]

30:26.160 --> 30:28.663
[Whinnying]

30:28.788 --> 30:33.626
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.

30:33.751 --> 30:37.588
-[Tulio]
It's an entire city of suckers.
-[Miguel Laughing]

30:37.672 --> 30:39.632
We just have to keep
this up long enough...

30:39.757 --> 30:43.135
to load up on the gold
and then get the hell out of here!

30:43.261 --> 30:45.763
Tulio, we'll be living like kings!

30:45.888 --> 30:48.557
-Miguel and Tulio!
-Tulio and Miguel!

30:48.683 --> 30:51.310
-Mighty and powerful gods.
-Gods.

30:51.435 --> 30:54.355
-Hello.
-[Both Gasping, Whimpering]

30:54.480 --> 30:57.441
-[Laughing]
-Depart, mortal,

30:57.567 --> 31:00.570
-before we strike you
with a lightning bolt.
-Mmm. Mmmm!

31:00.653 --> 31:02.363
[Humming]

31:02.488 --> 31:05.366
Beware the wrath of the gods! Begone!
[Clicking Sound]

31:05.449 --> 31:08.536
Save it for the high priest, honey.
You're gonna need it.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.955
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel, it's not working.

31:11.038 --> 31:13.541
-[Clicking Sound]
-Miguel! We've been caught.

31:13.624 --> 31:16.168
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.

31:16.252 --> 31:20.506
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?

31:20.631 --> 31:23.843
-How?
-Well, if you guys want the gold,

31:23.926 --> 31:25.970
then you don't want
to get caught, right?

31:26.095 --> 31:30.016
-You're going to need my help.
-[Scoffs] What makes you
think we need your help?

31:31.350 --> 31:34.312
-"Ck-ck." Are you serious?
-[Whinnies]

31:34.395 --> 31:37.398
I-What-We--

31:37.481 --> 31:40.276
Okay. So, uh, who are you?

31:40.401 --> 31:43.571
-Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
-[Laughs] No angle.

31:43.654 --> 31:46.282
-I want in.
-In?

31:46.407 --> 31:49.243
-On the scam.
-[Chuckles]

31:49.327 --> 31:51.537
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a--

31:51.662 --> 31:54.707
-Why?
-So I can get out.

31:54.832 --> 31:57.001
I thought she just said she wanted in?

31:57.126 --> 31:59.420
She wants in so she can get out.

31:59.503 --> 32:02.465
Aha! Got it.
[Chuckles]

32:02.548 --> 32:06.510
-W-Why?
-Think you're the only ones
who dream of better things?

32:06.636 --> 32:10.306
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons,

32:10.389 --> 32:12.308
and I've got mine.

32:12.391 --> 32:14.810
Let's not make it personal, okay?

32:14.936 --> 32:18.356
-It's just business.
-[Both] Oh.

32:18.439 --> 32:21.484
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...

32:21.609 --> 32:23.778
wherever you came from,

32:23.861 --> 32:26.239
-I'm going with you.
-[Laughs]

32:26.322 --> 32:29.283
No!
Don't think so.

32:29.367 --> 32:31.285
[Coughs]

32:31.369 --> 32:33.496
-[Whistling]
-All right. Fine.

32:33.621 --> 32:35.498
After all, I'm sure you know...

32:35.623 --> 32:38.709
the proper rituals
for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar--

32:38.793 --> 32:42.755
Oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.

32:42.839 --> 32:45.925
[Chuckles]
Okay? Good luck.

32:48.553 --> 32:51.931
-See you at the execution.
-[Gibberish]

32:52.014 --> 32:54.433
Wait! Ho--
Would you-Hold it.

32:58.855 --> 33:01.649
-[Chuckles] Deal?
-Hmm.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.486
-Deal.
-Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.

33:05.570 --> 33:09.866
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means
you'll want these back?

33:11.868 --> 33:14.954
-How'd you get those?
-Where was she keeping them?

33:15.079 --> 33:18.666
-Call me, Chel, your new partner.
-Uh,

33:18.791 --> 33:20.668
-that's partner-in-training.
-[Humming]

33:20.793 --> 33:22.753
Now, put these on.

33:22.879 --> 33:25.089
Your public's waiting.
[Continues]

33:26.257 --> 33:28.384
-[Chel Giggling]
-Do you mind?

33:28.509 --> 33:30.428
No.

33:30.511 --> 33:32.430
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Giggles]

33:32.513 --> 33:34.599
Right. Uh, excuse me.

33:34.724 --> 33:37.852
-[Grunting]
-Bye.

33:40.062 --> 33:43.941
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place "Chel Dorado."

33:44.025 --> 33:47.069
[Chuckles]
She's whoo--

33:47.153 --> 33:49.280
-Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
-What?

33:49.405 --> 33:51.532
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?

33:51.616 --> 33:54.702
Ju-Ju-Just for a second
imagine that you have one.

33:54.827 --> 33:57.371
What would it be saying about Chel?

33:58.539 --> 34:01.417
-[Purrs]
-No. No. Listen.

34:01.501 --> 34:03.419
-We are partners.
-We are partners.

34:03.503 --> 34:07.215
-We have a plan, remember?
-Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.510
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.

34:10.635 --> 34:13.596
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

34:13.721 --> 34:17.308
-Listen carefully.
-[Gasps]

34:17.391 --> 34:22.730
-Chel is off-limits, hmm?
-Bravo! Chel is off-limits!

34:22.813 --> 34:24.732
Shake on it.

34:24.815 --> 34:27.610
-Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
-[Both] Mmmm.

34:27.735 --> 34:30.071
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.

34:30.196 --> 34:32.281
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.

34:32.406 --> 34:38.246
-Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.
-Tulio, relax!

34:38.329 --> 34:42.917
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

34:43.042 --> 34:45.420
[Gasps]

34:46.295 --> 34:48.965
[Gasps] Big smile.
Like you mean it.

34:49.090 --> 34:51.050
A-one, two, three.

34:55.804 --> 34:59.725
I hardly think I'm qualified

34:59.809 --> 35:02.603
To come across all sanctified

35:02.728 --> 35:06.607
I just don't cut it
with the cherubim

35:06.649 --> 35:09.277
-[Groaning]
-Tulio, what are you talking about?

35:09.402 --> 35:12.405
There again they're on their knees

35:12.488 --> 35:15.032
Being worshipped is a breeze

35:15.116 --> 35:17.744
Which rather suits us in

35:17.869 --> 35:21.914
-The interim
-Interim, interim
It's me and him

35:22.039 --> 35:25.209
Oh, my God!
It's tough to be a god

35:25.334 --> 35:29.338
Tread where mortals have not trod

35:29.464 --> 35:34.177
Be deified when really you're a sham

35:35.887 --> 35:38.848
Be an object of devotion

35:38.890 --> 35:41.851
Be the subject of psalms

35:41.976 --> 35:44.854
It's a rather touching notion

35:44.979 --> 35:48.232
All those prayers and those salaams

35:48.316 --> 35:51.569
And who am I to bridle

35:51.694 --> 35:54.030
If I'm forced to be an idol

35:54.113 --> 35:57.408
If they say that I'm a god

35:57.492 --> 35:59.619
That's what I am

35:59.744 --> 36:02.997
What's more if we don't comply

36:03.122 --> 36:05.166
With the locals' wishes

36:05.249 --> 36:09.379
I can see us being sacrificed

36:09.504 --> 36:11.839
-Or stuffed
-You have a point there.
Very good thinking.

36:11.964 --> 36:15.676
-So let's be gods
The perks are great
-Yeah!

36:15.802 --> 36:18.721
-El Dorado on our plates
-Thank you.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.932
Local feelings should not

36:21.057 --> 36:22.934
-Be rebuffed
-Never rebuffed

36:23.059 --> 36:26.729
I never rebuff a local feeling
No, my friend

36:26.854 --> 36:28.898
It's tough to be a god

36:29.023 --> 36:32.443
But if you get the people's nod

36:32.568 --> 36:35.113
Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet

36:35.196 --> 36:38.908
-That's our advice
-It's great advice!

36:38.991 --> 36:41.994
Be a symbol of perfection

36:42.120 --> 36:45.206
Be a legend
Be a cult

36:45.289 --> 36:48.042
Take their praise
Take a collection

36:48.126 --> 36:51.045
As the multitudes exalt

36:51.129 --> 36:54.257
Don a supernatural habit

36:54.382 --> 36:57.677
-We'd be crazy not to grab it
-You got it!

36:57.760 --> 37:00.054
So sign on two new gods

37:00.138 --> 37:02.849
For paradise

37:02.932 --> 37:06.978
Par-a-dise

37:07.103 --> 37:09.313
-[Continues]
-[Chattering, Laughing]

37:12.025 --> 37:15.153
-[Screeching]
-[Drunken Whinnying]

37:20.783 --> 37:22.660
[Fades, Ends]

37:23.786 --> 37:27.665
[Both Snoring, Mumbling]

37:31.753 --> 37:34.547
-[Metallic Clattering]
-[Both Gasping]

37:34.672 --> 37:37.550
Good morning, my lords!

37:37.675 --> 37:41.596
-He's back!
-Oh, no.

37:44.766 --> 37:46.934
And now it's my turn!

37:49.979 --> 37:54.984
-The gods have awakened!
-[Cheering]

37:55.068 --> 37:56.986
Whoa!
[Groans]

37:57.070 --> 37:59.489
Mm-hmm.

37:59.614 --> 38:02.116
-[Grunts]
-[Whimpering]

38:02.241 --> 38:06.496
-Hey, Chel, what's going on?
-It's not gonna be good.

38:06.579 --> 38:08.581
Thank you.

38:08.706 --> 38:11.292
This city has been granted
a great blessing.

38:11.376 --> 38:16.214
And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

38:16.339 --> 38:19.467
A meager celebration.

38:19.592 --> 38:24.013
-The gods deserve a proper tribute!
-[Crowd Gasping]

38:25.223 --> 38:27.725
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

38:27.809 --> 38:32.689
The beginning of a new era,
the dawning of a new age...

38:32.814 --> 38:35.775
demands...

38:35.900 --> 38:38.236
sacrifice!

38:38.319 --> 38:40.238
-[All Gasping]
-[Gasps]

38:44.826 --> 38:47.996
-I don't like this.
-Tulio, we've got to do something.

38:48.121 --> 38:50.415
[Groans]

38:54.794 --> 38:57.005
-[Groaning]
-[Yells]

38:57.130 --> 38:59.549
[Tulio]Stop!

38:59.632 --> 39:02.051
Hmm?

39:04.012 --> 39:06.681
-This is not a proper tribute!
-[Moaning]

39:06.806 --> 39:08.808
-[Crowd Gasps]
-You do not want the tribute?

39:08.891 --> 39:10.810
No. No, no.
W-We want tribute.

39:10.893 --> 39:14.856
Uh, it's just that, uh--
Tulio, tell him.

39:17.025 --> 39:21.154
The stars are not in position
for this tribute!

39:21.279 --> 39:23.615
Like he says, the stars--

39:23.740 --> 39:25.742
Can't do it.

39:25.867 --> 39:27.785
Not today.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.374
Ah.

39:33.458 --> 39:37.128
Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.

39:37.211 --> 39:41.215
-Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive--
-Hmm.

39:41.341 --> 39:46.179
My lords, may the people of El Dorado
offer you our tribute.

39:47.305 --> 39:49.349
[Crowd Gasping]

39:50.767 --> 39:52.644
[Gasps]

39:52.769 --> 39:55.647
[Gasping Continues]

39:56.898 --> 39:59.776
My lords, does this please you?

39:59.859 --> 40:02.612
-[Sighs]
-Yes, very nice.

40:02.737 --> 40:04.614
-Certainly acceptable.
-Yes, lovely. It'll do.

40:04.739 --> 40:07.575
The gods have chosen!

40:07.659 --> 40:09.577
To Xibalba?

40:09.661 --> 40:12.622
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-No. No.

40:12.705 --> 40:15.124
[Together] To Xibalba!

40:15.250 --> 40:17.126
-[Crowd Cheering]
-Oh, great.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.422
[Cheering Continues]

40:31.432 --> 40:34.644
Hey, Chel, um,
what are they doing?

40:34.769 --> 40:38.147
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit world.

40:39.816 --> 40:42.610
-The spirit world.
-I'll take care of it.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.073
[Clears Throat]
Um, excuse me, Chief.

40:47.198 --> 40:49.867
The gods have changed their minds
about Xibalba.

40:52.745 --> 40:57.166
They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.

40:57.250 --> 40:58.585
Stop!

41:02.422 --> 41:06.259
-[Crowd Murmuring]
-They wish to bask!

41:06.384 --> 41:09.554
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!

41:09.637 --> 41:12.265
-[Crowd Cheering]
-[Humming]

41:12.390 --> 41:14.392
Nice going.

41:20.982 --> 41:22.859
[Chuckles]

41:24.319 --> 41:26.654
Smile while you can.

41:37.624 --> 41:41.169
Well, well, well,

41:41.211 --> 41:43.880
what have we here?

41:44.005 --> 41:46.174
[Evil Chuckle]

41:46.299 --> 41:48.885
-[Tulio]Ai-ai-ai.
-Tons of gold for you, hah

41:49.010 --> 41:52.430
-And tons of gold for me, hoo
-[Together]
Tons of gold for we, ah

41:52.555 --> 41:55.683
-Not bad for a day's work, eh?
-Not bad at all.

41:55.808 --> 41:59.354
We just became richer
than the king of Spain. [Laughing]

41:59.479 --> 42:05.109
You know, speaking of kings, the chief
and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.

42:05.193 --> 42:07.278
Buenos días!

42:07.362 --> 42:09.739
Listen, all we have to do...

42:09.864 --> 42:14.202
is keep playing
the one against the other.

42:14.285 --> 42:17.205
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbo jumbo,

42:17.288 --> 42:19.749
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.

42:19.874 --> 42:24.838
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?

42:24.963 --> 42:27.507
Ummm--

42:27.632 --> 42:29.759
-A boat?
-[Tulio] Yeah.

42:29.884 --> 42:32.887
Um, we really hate
to be ascending so soon,

42:32.929 --> 42:35.473
but, uh, some urgent business
has come up--

42:35.598 --> 42:37.767
-family matters-and it's just a bit--
-Yeah, family.

42:37.851 --> 42:39.769
Badda-bing, budda-boom,
you know what I mean.

42:39.853 --> 42:42.897
Oh, we expected you
to be staying with us...

42:43.022 --> 42:45.859
for the next...
thousand years.

42:45.984 --> 42:48.111
Well, as we say
in the spirit world,

42:48.194 --> 42:51.781
-there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan.
-Mm-hmm.

42:51.906 --> 42:54.742
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...

42:54.826 --> 42:57.370
-kind of in
a horizontal pattern at first.
-[Chuckles]

42:57.495 --> 43:01.458
And then we're gonna go vertical,
uh, as we get further out to sea.

43:01.541 --> 43:04.752
Hmm. To build a boat
large and glorious enough...

43:04.878 --> 43:07.464
would take... about a week.

43:07.589 --> 43:10.216
-A week? Hmm.
-Um--

43:10.341 --> 43:13.386
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.

43:13.511 --> 43:17.265
But-But for the gods,
uh, three days.

43:17.390 --> 43:19.267
Uh--

43:19.392 --> 43:22.145
Well, if that's the best you can do.

43:22.228 --> 43:26.399
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened
with so much tribute,

43:26.524 --> 43:28.443
you could leave sooner.

43:28.526 --> 43:31.154
-Hmm?
-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?

43:31.279 --> 43:34.449
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.

43:34.574 --> 43:37.035
-[Tulio]No, three days is not fine.
-[Chel Humming]

43:37.118 --> 43:40.705
-This is a real--
-Mmm.

43:40.830 --> 43:45.043
-these-these are the ones-problem.
-Oh. Thank you.

43:45.168 --> 43:48.171
-Miguel, how are we gonna
keep this up for three days?
-[Yawns]

43:48.296 --> 43:50.256
You worry too much.

43:50.381 --> 43:52.550
No, I worry exactly the right amount.

43:52.675 --> 43:55.845
You can never worry too much.

43:55.929 --> 43:58.640
We just have to lie low.

43:58.765 --> 44:04.145
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's--

44:04.270 --> 44:06.689
No! Don't even move!

44:06.731 --> 44:08.650
-Tulio--
-You're moving!

44:08.691 --> 44:10.860
-A little, but-Come on.
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

44:10.985 --> 44:13.071
-[Stammering] Stay!
-I gotta-I--

44:13.154 --> 44:17.408
-[Groans]Just... stand there!
-I just--

44:18.827 --> 44:21.162
For three days?

44:21.287 --> 44:23.289
-[Clatter]
-Yes! Exactly.

44:23.373 --> 44:27.502
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?

44:28.837 --> 44:30.755
All right.
We lie low.

44:30.839 --> 44:32.882
No, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Promise?

44:33.007 --> 44:34.884
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

44:35.009 --> 44:38.388
Great! Good. Okay.

44:38.471 --> 44:41.891
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.
-[Giggling]

44:43.852 --> 44:46.396
[Kissing]

44:46.521 --> 44:49.190
Oh, yum, yum, yum.

44:49.315 --> 44:51.735
[Kissing Continues]

44:51.818 --> 44:54.738
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah!

44:54.863 --> 44:58.241
-You know, you really shouldn't miss it.
-I know.

44:58.366 --> 45:00.535
But I-I couldn't.

45:00.660 --> 45:03.580
Go ahead.
I'll cover for you.

45:03.663 --> 45:07.625
-Oh, good. Thanks.
-[Tulio Singing, Indistinct]

45:07.709 --> 45:10.044
-So, what happened to Altivo?
-I don't know.

45:10.128 --> 45:13.882
Tulio goes for paradise

45:14.007 --> 45:17.385
-Hey, what happened to Miguel?
-I don't know.

45:17.510 --> 45:21.056
Oh, my God! He's gone!
Miguel's gone!

45:21.139 --> 45:23.391
He's loose!
What am I gonna do?

45:23.516 --> 45:27.103
Oh, no, no!
[Sobbing]

45:27.228 --> 45:30.690
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.

45:30.815 --> 45:32.776
[Groaning]

45:32.859 --> 45:35.945
Oh. Ooh.
[Moans]

45:36.071 --> 45:40.241
-Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, down, down, down.
-[Humming]

45:40.367 --> 45:43.286
-No! No! Big trouble.
-[Gasps]

45:43.370 --> 45:45.747
[Chuckling] Whoa!

45:45.872 --> 45:49.125
Look, sweetheart,
we're in the middle of a con here,

45:49.250 --> 45:51.461
walking the razor's edge.

45:51.586 --> 45:54.005
On the one hand, gold!

45:54.130 --> 45:58.635
On the other hand,
painful, agonizing failure!

45:58.760 --> 46:02.722
[Clears Throat] I can't afford
any tempta-uh, distractions.

46:02.847 --> 46:06.142
So, I'm sorry.
So sorry.

46:06.226 --> 46:09.938
[Sharp Inhale] But perhaps
another time? Another place, hmm?

46:10.021 --> 46:13.441
[Chuckles]
Too bad. I'm free now.

46:14.984 --> 46:18.571
I'm... not really sure
I trust you.

46:18.655 --> 46:21.616
Mmm, I'm not really
asking you to trust me.

46:21.700 --> 46:24.994
-Am I?
-Whoo.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.080
'Kay.

46:27.205 --> 46:29.124
[Moans]

46:29.207 --> 46:31.292
Ooh, yeah.

46:37.090 --> 46:39.634
[Chirping]

46:53.481 --> 46:55.859
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

46:57.068 --> 46:59.779
Hey, where is everybody?

46:59.904 --> 47:02.073
They've been cleared
from the streets, my lord,

47:02.157 --> 47:05.452
so the city can be cleansed,
as you ordered.

47:05.535 --> 47:07.620
-Cleansed?
-Yes.

47:07.746 --> 47:11.041
So the Age of the Jaguar can begin,

47:11.166 --> 47:13.043
-as you ordered, my lord.
-[Man]Get back in!

47:13.168 --> 47:15.086
-Where are you going?
-Hey, stop that!

47:15.170 --> 47:17.047
-[Guard]Move!
-Hey, stop that!

47:17.130 --> 47:19.382
What are you doing?
Stop that!

47:19.466 --> 47:21.593
But, my lord,
anyone who disobeys your orders...

47:21.718 --> 47:24.512
must be punished, as you ordered.

47:24.638 --> 47:27.724
It seems I've been giving
a lot of orders, haven't I?

47:27.849 --> 47:30.393
Tzekel-Kan has made
your commands clear, my lord.

47:30.518 --> 47:32.687
Really?

47:32.729 --> 47:36.149
-Here's an order: Take the day off.
-Huh?

47:37.359 --> 47:40.737
-Are you all right?
-[Panting]

47:40.862 --> 47:42.989
-Here.
-[Whimpers]

47:44.783 --> 47:48.370
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.

The more I learn

48:30.203 --> 48:33.081
The more I see

48:34.874 --> 48:39.504
The less the world impassions me

48:41.923 --> 48:44.050
The hungry heart

48:45.260 --> 48:47.304
The roving eye

48:48.555 --> 48:50.557
Have come to rest

48:50.682 --> 48:53.226
Do not apply

48:56.021 --> 48:58.315
The frantic chase

48:59.566 --> 49:02.444
The crazy ride

49:02.527 --> 49:06.364
The thrill has gone

49:06.489 --> 49:09.492
I step aside

49:09.618 --> 49:11.119
I'd believe

49:11.244 --> 49:12.954
In anything

49:13.079 --> 49:15.457
Were it not for you

49:16.708 --> 49:20.295

49:20.378 --> 49:23.381
Only this is true

49:23.506 --> 49:25.800

50:16.851 --> 50:21.898
Hmm. This is not what I expected.

50:23.108 --> 50:25.068
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.

50:25.193 --> 50:27.654
[Chuckling]

50:27.737 --> 50:29.656
How do I look?

50:29.781 --> 50:33.076
Oh, uh-Well, you--

50:33.201 --> 50:35.120
Oh, shut up.

50:35.245 --> 50:37.873
-[Tulio Gasps]Oh! Whoa!
-[Chel Humming]

-[Tzekel-Kan]My lord?
-[Gasps]

50:39.958 --> 50:42.836
-Hello?
-The high priest.
-Ow!

50:42.961 --> 50:46.882
[Gasps] What's he gonna think if he
finds one of the gods like this with me?

Oh, Tzekel-Kan!

50:58.018 --> 51:03.231
-What brings you here?
-I-I-I-I-I humbly request
an audience with you, my lord.

51:03.356 --> 51:08.695
-Yes, what can I do for you?
-My lord, I have just seen
Lord Miguel out among the people.

51:08.778 --> 51:12.949
-Really?
-If I may be so bold as to
offer some advice.

51:13.033 --> 51:15.577
-All right. Shoot.
-[Clears Throat]

51:15.660 --> 51:17.996
My lord, you are perfect.

51:18.079 --> 51:20.290
[Chuckles]
Oh, well. Go on.

51:20.373 --> 51:25.587
But in your perfection, you cannot know
how imperfect humans are.

51:25.712 --> 51:30.842
-Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.
-[Hissing]

51:30.967 --> 51:36.097
They are as untrustworthy as rats,
stealing and cheating with no remorse.

Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!

51:41.770 --> 51:44.439
Stop it!
That's disgusting.

51:44.564 --> 51:47.192
They're beyond disgusting!

51:47.275 --> 51:50.487
-Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
-Then we're in agreement.

51:50.570 --> 51:52.989
I'll begin the necessary
preparations immediately.

51:53.073 --> 51:57.744
Do you wish to have
your victims bound to an altar,
or would you prefer them free-range?

51:57.869 --> 52:00.497
-[Mutters]
-And will you be devouring
their essence whole...

52:00.622 --> 52:03.416
or piece by piece?

52:03.542 --> 52:05.961
Tzekel, you've lost me.

52:06.086 --> 52:10.048
My lord, these people will not
respect you if they do not fear you.

52:10.132 --> 52:12.592
And, of course, we'll make them
fear us by--

52:12.717 --> 52:15.262
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied

52:15.387 --> 52:18.932
-The history of the Age
of the Jaguar will be written in--
-Ink?

52:19.015 --> 52:21.226
-Blood!
-Blood! Oh, right.

52:21.351 --> 52:24.020
Of course. I should probably
consult with Lord Miguel.

52:24.104 --> 52:28.066
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh,

52:28.150 --> 52:31.611
blood issue right away.

and get out of here now!
-What? Why?

53:10.650 --> 53:12.861
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants--

53:12.944 --> 53:15.447
-This is unacceptable!
-Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.

53:15.530 --> 53:18.992
The gods should not
be playing ball like this!

53:19.117 --> 53:23.789

What is the object of this game,
pray tell?

53:35.842 --> 53:37.719
You've gotta knock the ball
through the hoop.

53:37.844 --> 53:39.721
-What hoop?
-That hoop.

53:39.846 --> 53:42.724
-[Cheering Continues]
-That's impossible.

-[Warriors] Heep-ha!

54:03.036 --> 54:07.624
but I do hope they'll challenge you
enough to make the game... interesting.

Well, no, no, no, no, no--

the, um, traditional, uh,
first avoidance maneuver.

-Yes! Yes!
-My lords,
congratulations on your victory.

57:56.979 --> 58:00.023
And now, you will, of course,
wish to have the losing team...

58:00.148 --> 58:02.609
-sacrificed to your glory.
-[Crowd Gasping]

-Look, Tzekel-Kan,
-Uh, Miguel?

58:09.074 --> 58:11.410
-forget the sacrifices.
-Miguel.

58:11.535 --> 58:14.246
We don't want any sacrifices.

58:14.329 --> 58:19.084
But all of the sacred writings
say that you will devour
the wicked and the unrighteous.

58:19.209 --> 58:22.004
Well, I don't see anyone here
who fits that description.

58:22.129 --> 58:25.465
[Scoffs]
Well, as speaker for the gods,

58:25.591 --> 58:29.845
it would be my privilege
to point them out.

58:29.928 --> 58:32.806
The gods are speaking
for themselves now!

58:32.889 --> 58:35.225
This city and these people...

58:35.309 --> 58:37.436
have no need for you anymore!

58:37.519 --> 58:39.813

my first commandment, huh? [Laughs]

59:17.309 --> 59:19.728
Miguel, the little voice--
[Stammers]

59:19.770 --> 59:21.730
Yeah, fine.

59:25.108 --> 59:28.612
Do you know why
the gods demand blood?

59:28.737 --> 59:31.865
-I don't know.
-[Grunts]

59:31.990 --> 59:34.868
Because gods don't bleed.

59:38.455 --> 59:42.000
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,

59:42.084 --> 59:44.503
and this city will be cleansed.

59:44.628 --> 59:47.256
Even if I have to do it myself.

59:47.339 --> 59:49.675
-Uh, how?
-[Grunts]

59:49.758 --> 59:53.470

59:56.265 --> 59:59.184
Ooh. My, my, my, my, my.

59:59.268 --> 01:00:02.604
It's not called
the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.

[Snickering]

01:00:06.859 --> 01:00:12.114

-Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
-Nice?

01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:50.194
-Yes, nice.
-But?

01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:54.490
Um, but, uh,
is it really fit for the gods?

01:00:54.573 --> 01:00:56.492
-My lord.
-[Chuckles]

01:00:56.575 --> 01:01:00.537
I have been around boats, believe me,

01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:04.249
and that, um--
the pointy, tall, um--

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:06.335
the-the-the-the long
up and down thing--

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.588
-The mast?
-The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.

01:01:09.713 --> 01:01:13.383
Well, look at it. [Stammering]
There's not nearly enough, uh,

01:01:13.509 --> 01:01:15.427
um, rope.

01:01:15.511 --> 01:01:18.722
-Rope?
-Yes, rope. Exactly my point.

01:01:18.847 --> 01:01:22.601
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more, uh, rope.

01:01:22.684 --> 01:01:26.855
-My lord. [Chuckles]
-And look at this. [Grunting]

01:01:26.939 --> 01:01:30.234
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
This doesn't look at all secure.

01:01:30.359 --> 01:01:35.531
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but all
in all, it is a complete do-over.

01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:41.495
Hmm.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.958
You know, Lord Miguel,

01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:48.460
if you wish to stay,

01:01:48.585 --> 01:01:50.879
you only need to say so.

01:01:52.005 --> 01:01:55.968
-You mean... forever?
-Of course.

01:02:00.055 --> 01:02:02.975
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.102
We're-We're partners.

01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:08.897

01:02:10.357 --> 01:02:12.568
Yep. Big plans.

01:02:12.651 --> 01:02:17.197
Well, then,
I better go get some more rope, huh?

01:02:17.322 --> 01:02:20.117
Oh, Chief, um,
forget about the rope.

01:02:20.242 --> 01:02:22.202
Um, my mistake.

01:02:22.327 --> 01:02:25.456

[Laughing]
I don't think so.

01:02:44.892 --> 01:02:48.562
I-I'll tell you what. Uh, I'll let you
come back to Spain with us,

01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:52.858
like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you,

01:02:52.983 --> 01:02:54.943
mmm, ten percent?

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:59.198
[Chuckles] You know, maybe I won't go
to Spain with you and take a third.

01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:01.450
Ohh! [Chuckling]

01:03:01.575 --> 01:03:03.827
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.

01:03:03.911 --> 01:03:06.789
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:11.418
-I want you to want... what you want.
-Mm-hmm?

01:03:11.543 --> 01:03:13.712

that's what you want.

-Okay.

In a crowded street

01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:49.532
And watched it slip away

Where are we now

01:23:52.702 --> 01:23:54.996

Still capture me-e-e

01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:28.006
Someday out of the blue

01:25:28.131 --> 01:25:30.425
Maybe years from now

01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:33.803
Or tomorrow night

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:36.806
I'll turn and I'll see you

01:25:36.889 --> 01:25:39.934
As if we always knew

01:25:40.018 --> 01:25:42.937
Someday we would live again

01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:45.940
Someday soon

01:25:58.077 --> 01:26:01.122
The more I learn

01:26:03.207 --> 01:26:06.210
The more I see

01:26:08.338 --> 01:26:15.011
The less the world impassions me

01:26:18.556 --> 01:26:21.142
The hungry heart

01:26:23.686 --> 01:26:26.856
The roving eye

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.486
Have come to rest

01:26:31.611 --> 01:26:35.698
Do not apply

01:26:39.285 --> 01:26:41.913
The frantic chase

01:26:44.415 --> 01:26:47.085
The crazy ride

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:52.799
The thrill has gone

01:26:54.884 --> 01:26:58.638
I step aside

01:26:58.721 --> 01:27:01.099
And I'd believe

01:27:01.182 --> 01:27:04.018
In anything

01:27:04.102 --> 01:27:07.230
Were it not for you

01:27:09.107 --> 01:27:11.359
Showing me

01:27:11.442 --> 01:27:14.362
By just existing

01:27:14.445 --> 01:27:17.532
Only this is true

01:27:18.992 --> 01:27:23.830
-I love you
-[Chorus Vocalizing]

01:27:23.913 --> 01:27:29.002
-I love you
-[Vocalizing Continues]

01:27:29.085 --> 01:27:32.380
Without question

01:27:32.505 --> 01:27:36.301
I love you

01:27:48.938 --> 01:27:54.110
-The more I want
-[Chorus] The more I steal

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:59.199
-The more I steal
-The more I hold

01:27:59.282 --> 01:28:01.701
The more I hold

01:28:01.826 --> 01:28:06.247
The less is real

01:28:09.626 --> 01:28:14.756
-All worldly things
-I follow blind

01:28:14.881 --> 01:28:19.969
-I follow blind
-In hope, not faith

01:28:20.011 --> 01:28:22.305
In hope, not faith

01:28:22.388 --> 01:28:26.476
Was paid in kind

01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:33.024
The line is drawn

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.071
The change is made

01:28:40.573 --> 01:28:43.660
I come to you

01:28:45.745 --> 01:28:49.541
I'm not afraid

01:28:49.666 --> 01:28:52.043
And I'd believe

01:28:52.168 --> 01:28:54.754
In anything

01:28:54.838 --> 01:28:57.882
Were it not for you

01:29:00.093 --> 01:29:02.387
Showing me

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:05.306
By just existing

01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:08.184
Only this is true

01:29:09.853 --> 01:29:12.147
I love you

01:29:12.188 --> 01:29:22.198
