WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:05.096
Cute, isn't he?

00:07.875 --> 00:10.639
I want you to find
whoever is doing this to me.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.201
I don't know
what I was expecting,

00:12.280 --> 00:13.645
but they sure
don't look scary.

00:13.714 --> 00:18.481
I am not going to let them
intimidate me out of
testifying against Lazarus.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.383
You gotta throw it
right back at them,
Carol.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.921
You can't let them know
you're scared.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.116
Where's Carol?

02:40.878 --> 02:42.778
Chels, I'm home.

02:48.186 --> 02:49.585
Chelsea?

02:52.457 --> 02:53.981
Chels, come on, girl.

02:57.195 --> 02:58.628
Oh, damn.

03:02.533 --> 03:03.522
Chels?

03:25.590 --> 03:26.579
Hello?

03:28.893 --> 03:30.053
Who is this?

03:51.716 --> 03:52.876
Chels?

03:55.853 --> 03:57.013
Chels?

04:49.540 --> 04:51.007
What do you want, Higgins?

04:51.075 --> 04:52.007
Oh, good.
There you are.

04:52.076 --> 04:54.169
I've only got 46 minutes left
to catch my plane.

04:54.245 --> 04:56.076
And there are some
important details
we must discuss.

04:56.147 --> 04:57.171
Your phone's ringing,
Higgins.

04:57.248 --> 04:58.579
If it's important,
they'll call back.

04:58.649 --> 05:00.583
Plane? What plane?
Where are you going?

05:00.651 --> 05:02.084
Well, the Great
Moloka'i Mule Ride.

05:02.153 --> 05:04.246
I'd scheduled the trip
this week and somehow I...

05:04.322 --> 05:06.222
Here it is.
Where was I?

05:06.290 --> 05:08.053
The Great Moloka'i Mule Ride.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.559
Quite right.
In the Kalaupapa.

05:10.628 --> 05:13.188
I've been planning the trip
for months and somehow
it suddenly slipped my mind.

05:13.264 --> 05:14.959
Here's a list
of instructions.

05:15.032 --> 05:16.829
All right, Higgins.

05:17.501 --> 05:18.490
What's the gag?

05:18.569 --> 05:21.060
I assure you, there's no gag.
Now, if you'll just help me
with that luggage.

05:21.138 --> 05:23.333
Higgins, nothing ever
completely slips your mind.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.567
What are you up to?

05:25.877 --> 05:27.868
Oh, my God.
If that's for me, tell them...

05:27.945 --> 05:29.003
Tell them
I'm already gone.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.513
Tell them
I can't be reached.

05:33.784 --> 05:34.842
Robin Masters' estate.

05:34.919 --> 05:35.908
<i>Thomas?</i>

05:35.987 --> 05:38.820
Hi, Carol.
Higgins says he's already
gone and he can't be reached.

05:38.890 --> 05:40.289
<i>I came to see you.</i>

05:40.524 --> 05:42.321
She came to see me,
Higgins.

05:47.398 --> 05:49.332
I have left strict
instructions with Magnum

05:49.400 --> 05:51.800
regarding your dietary
and exercise program.

05:51.869 --> 05:55.566
Naturally, I will expect
nothing less than full
cooperation on your part.

05:56.741 --> 05:58.038
That's great, Higgins.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.836
If you think that I think

06:00.912 --> 06:03.244
that they actually
understand what is...

06:03.314 --> 06:06.147
It is imperative that
you follow that outline
explicitly,

06:06.217 --> 06:08.845
beginning with their
morning walk along the beach.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.320
The slightest variation
from their routine
could result in

06:11.389 --> 06:14.222
unpredictable and dangerous
mood swings.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.396
We certainly wouldn't
want that, would we?

06:22.967 --> 06:24.559
Well,
if I don't make that plane,

06:24.635 --> 06:26.432
the mule ride
will leave without me.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.706
Don't forget to write.

06:44.155 --> 06:46.214
I thought you said
Jonathan wasn't here.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.520
Well, he was.
But he's not.

06:48.592 --> 06:50.321
But he'll be back.

06:50.528 --> 06:52.257
But as long as he's gone,

06:52.463 --> 06:55.296
I happen to know where
he keeps his secret stash

06:55.366 --> 06:57.266
of Jamaican Blue Mountain
coffee beans.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.394
Can I interest you in a cup?
Oh, it sounds wonderful.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.676
But first, there's just
one little thing
I have to take care of.

07:09.113 --> 07:13.015
And then, yesterday,
I was looking for a file
that I'd been working on

07:13.084 --> 07:15.052
and it wasn't in any
of my filing cabinets.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.952
I went through every drawer
in my desk and you know
where it turned up?

07:18.022 --> 07:19.683
Where?
In the ladies' room.

07:19.757 --> 07:21.281
Maybe you left it there.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.418
Hey, you think we could
catch our breath for a minute?

07:23.494 --> 07:24.620
I'm really not
dressed for jogging.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.923
Zeus, Apollo, halt!

07:28.032 --> 07:29.329
They stopped.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.867
You told them to.

07:34.939 --> 07:35.928
Stay!

07:41.846 --> 07:42.972
It's Higgins.

07:44.982 --> 07:48.941
He's around here somewhere
giving them secret signals.

07:50.955 --> 07:51.944
Oh, Thomas.

07:52.023 --> 07:53.456
Higgins, I know
what you're doing!

07:53.524 --> 07:54.513
Anyway,

07:54.592 --> 07:58.722
a couple of mornings
this week, I've woken up
to discover some things,

07:58.996 --> 08:00.520
you know, moved around.

08:00.598 --> 08:03.328
Books and photographs
and even my stuffed animal.

08:03.401 --> 08:07.167
Maybe he's using a whistle.
You know, one of those
ultrasonic things.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.329
Oh.

08:12.009 --> 08:16.105
I'm sorry, Carol.
I'm just a little distracted.

08:16.347 --> 08:17.405
What were you saying?

08:18.282 --> 08:21.217
All right,
I can understand
my car being moved

08:21.285 --> 08:23.116
and some things
missing in my house.

08:23.187 --> 08:25.485
I mean, that could
be forgetfulness, right?

08:25.556 --> 08:28.218
But last night
when I got home,
my electricity was off,

08:28.292 --> 08:31.227
my back door was wide open
and Chelsea was missing.

08:31.362 --> 08:32.760
You know,
I forget a lot of things,

08:32.830 --> 08:37.062
but I would never go off
and leave my door wide open
so my dog could run away.

08:38.135 --> 08:39.727
Well, did you find her?

08:41.905 --> 08:43.965
I put up notices all around
the neighborhood, you know.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.975
She'll probably
come home today.

08:48.379 --> 08:49.710
I guess they wanna go.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.111
Oh, wait!

08:56.187 --> 08:59.623
Well, do you want me
to drive by your place
and see if I can find her?

08:59.690 --> 09:02.659
I want you to find
whoever is doing this to me.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.387
Don't you have any idea
who it might be?

09:04.462 --> 09:06.191
Somebody with a grudge
against you?

09:06.263 --> 09:08.823
I don't know. Somebody
I've prosecuted, maybe.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.649
Or that you're going to.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.779
Look, why don't
I come by your office later?

09:13.854 --> 09:16.948
We'll go over your caseload,
see if we come up with
a list of suspects.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.251
Thank you.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.588
Okay?
Yeah.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.564
Okay.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.462
Bye.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.667
I really appreciate this,
Thomas.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.677
Welfare fraud,
illegal sale of firearms,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.410
phony passports, I mean...

09:44.484 --> 09:45.473
They're all pretty
cut and dry.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.019
I'll still look them over.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.687
Ready for lunch, Counselor?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.090
Ah, Steve, I'm sorry.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.457
Steve Elliott,
this is Thomas Magnum.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.554
How do you do?
Hi.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.462
Steve is working with me
on the Talbot case.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.694
Working for her
is more like it.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.960
Thomas is
a private investigator

10:04.037 --> 10:06.005
and he's helping me with
something that just came up.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.403
Something for us?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.839
No, no, personal.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.376
So, we have so many files
to look through.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.936
I just... I think
I'm gonna have to take
a rain check on the lunch.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.414
Sorry.
Tomorrow?

10:16.483 --> 10:17.973
How about tomorrow?
Well, uh...

10:18.051 --> 10:19.177
12:30?
Maybe.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.516
Italian, Thai?
I'll have to see, okay?

10:21.588 --> 10:23.818
Okay. Oh, here.
Oh, thanks.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.221
Nice meeting you.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.725
You, too.
- Yeah.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.060
What about
this Talbot thing?

10:34.501 --> 10:35.695
Anything there?

10:35.769 --> 10:38.033
Maybe.
It's a very important case.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.204
In fact,
everybody in the office
was hoping to get it.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.936
It's a real surprise
it landed on my desk.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.045
Based on seniority alone,
it should have gone to
four other people.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.808
Based on hard work
and long hours,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.509
it should've gone to Steve.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.982
No, I don't think
it's anybody here.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.280
Mail.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.590
May I have it?

11:09.469 --> 11:12.097
I don't have anything
going out today, Moody.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.837
Tomorrow's another day.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.545
Axe murderer?

11:22.582 --> 11:24.072
What's this?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.846
Oh, this is cute.
Somebody sent me

11:30.056 --> 11:31.819
a box full of newspapers.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.988
Oh, Thomas, come here.
Look at this.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.727
"To the accompaniment
of chanting and crying
by his faithful followers,

11:44.804 --> 11:47.534
"Joey Lynwood, aka Lazarus,
was led..."
Yes.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.999
"...was led from the courtroom

11:50.076 --> 11:52.135
"to begin serving
three consecutive sentences

11:52.212 --> 11:53.907
"at Honolulu
Correctional Facilities."

11:53.980 --> 11:56.448
This was from 1968.
It can't be one of your cases.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.416
It was my dad's.
His last one.

11:59.819 --> 12:03.050
Well, why would anybody
be sending you articles
about Lazarus?

12:03.123 --> 12:06.149
He's sending me a message
because he's up for parole.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.488
And I'm going to testify
against him.

12:22.091 --> 12:23.524
<i>Heteropoda venatoria,</i>

12:23.593 --> 12:25.185
commonly known
as a Wolf Spider.

12:25.261 --> 12:27.126
They're completely harmless.

12:27.196 --> 12:28.720
He's all yours,
if you want him.

12:28.798 --> 12:30.789
No. I don't have
room for a pet.

12:32.602 --> 12:33.967
You all right?

12:34.036 --> 12:36.027
Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.333
Do you have some water?
Sure.

12:38.808 --> 12:42.972
How come your knees buckle
when you find out
you're going to be all right?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.504
I think we should
talk to the police.

12:45.581 --> 12:47.742
Oh, you know what
they're gonna say?

12:48.417 --> 12:51.511
"Now, how do we know that
that spider didn't crawl
in there by itself, ma'am?"

12:51.587 --> 12:55.079
No, come on.
The police don't care much
for hunches or gut feelings.

12:55.157 --> 12:57.557
I learned that
during the Lazarus trial.

12:57.627 --> 13:00.221
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, that's great.

13:04.166 --> 13:07.727
You can't imagine the pressure
that my father lived under
during that time.

13:07.803 --> 13:10.772
He collapsed of a heart attack
the day before the jury
brought in a verdict.

13:10.840 --> 13:11.864
Carol!

13:11.941 --> 13:13.499
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

13:13.576 --> 13:14.907
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

13:15.411 --> 13:17.743
Look at the size
of that thing.

13:17.914 --> 13:19.905
He's really harmless.
It's okay.

13:20.149 --> 13:22.447
In fact, I would like
to go back to work.

13:22.518 --> 13:24.247
No. I'll take you home.

13:24.420 --> 13:27.651
Oh, no, Thomas,
I'm not going to let them
stop me from doing my job.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.987
I'll be with her
all afternoon.
She'll be fine.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.686
I am fine.

13:31.761 --> 13:33.092
She'll be fine.

13:48.010 --> 13:51.241
<i>It's funny how you can</i>
<i>go through life never thinking</i>
<i>about the fact</i>

13:51.314 --> 13:54.249
<i>that your friends have</i>
<i>other friends besides you.</i>

13:54.584 --> 13:55.983
<i>Other people</i>
<i>who care about them</i>

13:56.052 --> 13:58.282
<i>and want to help them</i>
<i>when they're in trouble.</i>

13:58.354 --> 14:00.015
<i>Steve Elliott had</i>
<i>made it real clear</i>

14:00.122 --> 14:02.590
<i>that he would be</i>
<i>watching after Carol</i>
<i>the rest of the day.</i>

14:02.658 --> 14:03.647
Higgins!

14:03.726 --> 14:06.388
<i>I figured, the best thing</i>
<i>for me to do was find out</i>

14:06.462 --> 14:08.760
<i>what I could about</i>
<i>Lazarus and his friends.</i>

14:09.031 --> 14:12.091
<i>But first, I had to get home</i>
<i>and feed the lads.</i>

14:12.268 --> 14:14.395
<i>I knew Higgins</i>
<i>would be watching</i>

14:14.737 --> 14:16.329
<i>from somewhere.</i>

14:27.984 --> 14:30.851
Sorry, guys.
Higgins said,
"Lightly sautéed."

14:43.899 --> 14:45.059
You don't suppose

14:45.735 --> 14:47.896
Higgins actually went
to Moloka'i, do you?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.768
What am I doing?
I'm talking to the dogs.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.771
Nothing for you.

14:59.348 --> 15:01.282
But here's something
I think you'll like.

15:01.350 --> 15:05.650
"J.Q., most excited about
the Honolulu Jubilee Reunion
of the lads of Sandhurst.

15:05.721 --> 15:08.485
"Pity you won't be
able to participate
in the festivities.

15:08.557 --> 15:11.321
"Nevertheless, looking forward
to seeing you finally,

15:11.394 --> 15:12.622
"Jonathan Higgins'

15:14.130 --> 15:15.620
"estate by the sea?

15:16.465 --> 15:19.366
"Until then,
yours, et cetera,
Binky Smythe-White."

15:19.635 --> 15:21.500
How dare you read my mail.

15:21.737 --> 15:22.726
Higgins!

15:23.205 --> 15:25.070
The mule train
leave without you?

15:25.141 --> 15:28.577
Is the concept of
a gentleman's privacy
completely foreign to you?

15:28.644 --> 15:30.669
It's a postcard, Higgins.
Everybody reads postcards.

15:30.746 --> 15:32.441
Get out!
Get out of my kitchen.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.743
Your kitchen?

15:33.816 --> 15:36.250
Your kitchen?
Not Robin Masters' kitchen?

15:37.453 --> 15:39.250
But then,
I guess it is, isn't it?

15:39.321 --> 15:41.152
I mean,
how did Binky put it?

15:41.223 --> 15:43.453
"Jonathan Higgins'
estate by the sea"?

15:43.559 --> 15:46.255
Does Robin know about
this change of ownership?

15:48.964 --> 15:50.295
All right, what do you want?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.266
Tennis court privileges?
Wine cellar? What?

15:54.503 --> 15:55.993
I'll decide,

15:56.105 --> 15:57.629
after you tell me
what is going on here.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.232
Now, what is it Higgins?
I want the truth.

16:06.482 --> 16:08.382
From the time
I can first remember...

16:08.451 --> 16:09.440
No, no, no.

16:09.552 --> 16:14.148
Do not go all the way
back to, "From the time
I can first remember."

16:15.157 --> 16:18.593
...I dreamed
of being an officer
in her Majesty's service.

16:20.262 --> 16:23.231
It was winter.
My third year at Sandhurst.

16:23.999 --> 16:27.799
I was anxiously
awaiting the results
of midyear examinations.

16:28.971 --> 16:31.769
One of the chaps
in my living quarters,

16:32.608 --> 16:36.237
someone I had
taken under my wing
in his first year,

16:37.012 --> 16:39.003
took it into his head
to play a prank on

16:39.081 --> 16:41.879
one of the new students
residing in our unit.

16:42.685 --> 16:44.243
There was

16:45.287 --> 16:47.653
an unfortunate accident,
as a result.

16:48.724 --> 16:50.589
The young lad

16:50.960 --> 16:52.655
was left paralyzed.

16:55.698 --> 16:58.690
I'm not sure how it came
to be thought that

16:58.768 --> 17:00.827
I was the author of the prank.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.838
I was not, of course.

17:04.507 --> 17:05.531
But

17:06.642 --> 17:09.372
only my friend
and I knew that.

17:09.912 --> 17:11.345
But you couldn't tell.

17:11.914 --> 17:13.939
We had a very strict
honor code at Sandhurst,

17:14.016 --> 17:17.542
one which precluded informing
on one's fellow classmate.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.422
Yes, I know it well.

17:21.323 --> 17:24.223
But what about
your friend's honor code?

17:24.393 --> 17:26.987
It certainly didn't
preclude him
from stepping forward

17:27.061 --> 17:29.326
and taking responsibility
for his act.

17:29.932 --> 17:31.695
To tell you the truth,

17:31.934 --> 17:35.165
I fully expected him
to admit his culpability.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.904
By the time I realized
that he wasn't going to
do the honorable thing,

17:40.142 --> 17:41.609
it was too late.

17:42.778 --> 17:45.645
I had already been sent down.

17:50.953 --> 17:53.945
I enlisted in the Army
the following spring.

17:58.394 --> 18:01.261
My friend

18:01.997 --> 18:04.864
maintained a correspondence
with me over the years

18:05.201 --> 18:07.192
and finally, reluctantly,

18:08.504 --> 18:10.335
I began to respond.

18:13.008 --> 18:15.806
I can't remember
when I began to...

18:17.346 --> 18:18.335
To...

18:18.814 --> 18:20.475
Embellish a bit?

18:22.117 --> 18:23.106
Quite.

18:24.587 --> 18:28.114
Or why I thought
it would compensate
for the great loss I felt.

18:30.559 --> 18:32.720
I certainly never anticipated

18:33.028 --> 18:36.464
some day my mates would hold
a reunion here in Hawaii.

18:37.466 --> 18:38.990
And would all be

18:39.768 --> 18:42.293
looking forward
to seeing finally

18:43.072 --> 18:46.007
Jonathan Higgins'
estate by the sea.

18:48.577 --> 18:49.942
Higgins...

18:53.782 --> 18:55.977
I'm sorry. I thought...

18:57.253 --> 18:58.242
Well,

18:59.788 --> 19:00.812
I'm sorry.

19:00.890 --> 19:01.879
No, no, I...

19:03.125 --> 19:06.151
I thought briefly that I could
avoid it by going to Moloka'i.

19:06.829 --> 19:08.160
But at the airport,

19:08.230 --> 19:10.255
I realized that
I couldn't run away from it.

19:12.134 --> 19:15.035
There's nothing for me to do
but invite them over for tea

19:15.104 --> 19:17.265
and inform them
that I'm a fraud.

19:17.506 --> 19:18.803
Fraud?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.275
Isn't that a little harsh?

19:21.710 --> 19:25.202
Everybody makes up stuff
over the years.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.809
I mean, I...

19:28.784 --> 19:30.183
Why don't you just

19:31.453 --> 19:33.717
invite them over
and see what happens?

19:34.623 --> 19:36.250
Play it by ear.

19:37.526 --> 19:40.017
T. C: I'm not
going to play it at all.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.995
Come on, T.C.,
why not?

19:42.064 --> 19:45.591
Because one charity case
a week is my limit.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.961
And this little trip
to the old Lazarus ranch
is it for this week.

19:49.038 --> 19:52.303
Well, at least
think about it, okay?
Rick said he would.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.598
Rick said he'd do it?

19:54.677 --> 19:57.009
Well, no. He said
he'd think about it.

19:59.949 --> 20:04.010
There it is.
The last known residence
of the Joey Lazarus clan.

20:04.086 --> 20:05.917
Looks like any other ranch,
doesn't it?

20:19.001 --> 20:20.559
I don't know
what I was expecting,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.297
but they sure
don't look scary.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.177
Yes.

20:40.122 --> 20:41.714
A Pekinese.

20:41.790 --> 20:44.190
Golden brown and white.

20:45.594 --> 20:46.959
Oh, you haven't.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.397
Hello?

20:51.266 --> 20:52.460
Oh, damn it.

21:07.216 --> 21:08.911
Hello? Steve?

21:18.560 --> 21:21.154
Please, don't do this to me.
Come on.

21:21.597 --> 21:23.565
Come on. Open up.

22:02.438 --> 22:04.065
Open up, damn it!

22:32.968 --> 22:36.836
Oh, come on, Carol.
Just put the key in the lock.

22:39.641 --> 22:40.733
Attagirl.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.790
Oh, please.

23:07.469 --> 23:08.458
Hi.

23:09.171 --> 23:11.105
Can you open the door?

23:13.942 --> 23:15.466
I'm sorry it took so long.

23:15.544 --> 23:19.036
I had to go to three places
before I could get
rare roast beef.

23:20.349 --> 23:21.748
What's the matter?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.016
What's the matter?

23:24.153 --> 23:26.018
The electricity went off

23:26.321 --> 23:28.585
and I thought
someone was following me

23:28.657 --> 23:31.091
and then I couldn't
start the car.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.491
I want to call Thomas.

23:32.561 --> 23:33.687
I'll take you home.

23:33.762 --> 23:35.195
I need to go to Thomas.

23:35.264 --> 23:37.095
It's okay, it's okay. Shh.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.031
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

23:39.101 --> 23:40.625
It's okay.

24:05.393 --> 24:06.382
Chels?

24:16.771 --> 24:18.398
Did you find Chelsea?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.873
Oh, Thomas.
I didn't wake you, did I?

24:22.110 --> 24:26.479
No. No, actually,
I couldn't sleep, anyway.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.811
Oh, good.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.950
Boy, I thought for sure
she'd be back tonight.

24:31.019 --> 24:33.010
She's never been
gone this long.

24:35.723 --> 24:37.884
I'm gonna get a snack.
You want something?

24:39.160 --> 24:40.718
Well...

24:41.196 --> 24:44.563
Steve called. Again.
He's been back to the office.

24:45.033 --> 24:47.331
He's got a maintenance crew
over there

24:47.402 --> 24:49.393
and apparently it was just
a faulty circuit breaker.

24:50.605 --> 24:53.130
He's checking
circuit breakers
at 3:00 in the morning?

24:53.208 --> 24:56.336
Well, he said
he couldn't sleep until
he knew what had happened.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.003
He can't even figure out
what's wrong with my car.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.479
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Who is this guy?

25:00.548 --> 25:02.379
I mean,
I thought I was the one

25:02.450 --> 25:05.214
you kept up till all hours
worrying about you.

25:06.788 --> 25:09.518
At least you could've told me
you got a boyfriend.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.617
Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

25:13.862 --> 25:17.195
I mean, we went out
a couple of times.
That's, you know...

25:18.900 --> 25:20.424
I don't know. He...

25:20.501 --> 25:23.629
He kind of hovers
over me, you know?

25:24.672 --> 25:28.267
He's got too much enthusiasm.
It makes me nervous.

25:29.077 --> 25:33.343
But then, you know,
he is a very nice man.
Really good guy.

25:33.414 --> 25:35.245
And a steady job.

25:35.383 --> 25:38.375
He's thoughtful.
He's okay looking.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.210
Okay looking?

25:40.455 --> 25:42.821
Well, he's certainly
not Robert Redford.

25:43.491 --> 25:44.719
Who is?

25:44.792 --> 25:48.023
Do you know that
that is exactly
what my mother says?

25:48.096 --> 25:49.586
She keeps pointing out to me

25:49.664 --> 25:52.895
that all my girlfriends
have had wonderful weddings.

25:52.967 --> 25:54.662
And I keep pointing out to her

25:54.736 --> 25:57.466
that all my girlfriends
have also been divorced.

25:58.072 --> 25:59.767
Then she points out to me,

25:59.841 --> 26:02.435
that I have a tendency
to be a real smart aleck.

26:02.510 --> 26:03.499
You do.

26:05.713 --> 26:08.204
But I really consider
that an asset.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.615
You think maybe I'm...

26:12.253 --> 26:16.713
I mean, it has
occurred to me that
maybe I'm a romance junkie.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.093
You know, doomed
to roam the earth forever,

26:20.161 --> 26:22.652
searching for that
perfect mate.

26:24.532 --> 26:26.227
You ever feel like that?

26:26.467 --> 26:27.456
No.

26:31.272 --> 26:32.261
Well...

26:33.141 --> 26:36.042
Well, I guess it is something
that women do more.

26:36.978 --> 26:39.412
You know,
the knight-in-shining-armor
syndrome.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.710
I mean,
who can ever live up to that?

26:45.386 --> 26:47.946
You eat that much
in the middle of the night?

26:52.060 --> 26:54.051
Only when I'm scared.

26:59.500 --> 27:04.597
I am not going to let them
intimidate me out of
testifying against Lazarus.

27:04.672 --> 27:08.733
I'm going over there tomorrow
and I'm going to tell them
what I have to say.

27:09.610 --> 27:13.102
That's what
my dad would have done and
that's what I'm going to do.

27:13.181 --> 27:14.170
Good.

27:14.882 --> 27:16.281
And if your car
isn't fixed yet,

27:16.351 --> 27:17.909
I'll drive you
over there myself.

27:19.854 --> 27:20.843
You know,

27:21.823 --> 27:23.347
sometimes

27:25.226 --> 27:27.091
you remind me of my father.

27:27.962 --> 27:28.951
Me?

27:31.566 --> 27:34.763
I guess it's just
the way the light
reflects off the armor.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.232
Knight blindness.

27:39.674 --> 27:40.663
Yeah?

27:42.777 --> 27:44.438
There's only one cure for it.

27:49.217 --> 27:50.206
Sleep.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.151
And the harsh reality
that comes with daylight.

27:58.326 --> 27:59.759
You sure?

28:17.645 --> 28:18.634
Yeah.

28:56.717 --> 28:57.706
Tom?

29:02.857 --> 29:04.347
What brings the clan out?

29:04.425 --> 29:07.622
Oh, the parole board
has agreed to let
one of them testify.

29:07.695 --> 29:09.162
They were bringing
Lazarus in

29:09.230 --> 29:10.697
as I was leaving
the hearing room.

29:11.365 --> 29:13.356
Damn it! He's so alive.

29:13.901 --> 29:15.732
It doesn't even matter
what he's done.

29:15.803 --> 29:18.465
He still gets to live
and my father doesn't.

29:18.873 --> 29:19.897
That's okay.

29:19.974 --> 29:22.238
Look, at least it's over with.
You've testified.

29:22.310 --> 29:24.301
They'll leave you alone now.
Yeah.

29:24.378 --> 29:27.404
And I called in a favor
with a deejay friend of mine.

29:27.482 --> 29:29.882
He's gonna put
my phone number
out over the air

29:29.951 --> 29:31.885
in case anybody's
seen Chelsea.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.086
Oh, Thomas.
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

29:37.758 --> 29:40.727
And I'm not just talking about
the savings on the cab fares.

29:40.795 --> 29:44.253
I mean, all the free advice
and the slumber parties.

29:45.066 --> 29:46.226
I mean, let's just face it.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.029
You are really
a renaissance friend.

29:51.472 --> 29:52.598
Thank you.

29:57.345 --> 29:59.279
T. C: What makes you think
she's got a crush on you?

29:59.347 --> 30:02.373
Not me, T.C.
This friend of mine.

30:03.251 --> 30:04.878
Yeah. Right.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.385
This hypothetical friend
of yours.

30:08.456 --> 30:09.445
Right.

30:10.858 --> 30:13.827
What makes your friend think
the lady's in love?

30:14.795 --> 30:15.784
Well,

30:16.531 --> 30:19.432
they've known each other
for a long time.

30:20.234 --> 30:21.360
Quite a while.

30:21.435 --> 30:23.494
And she's been kind of

30:23.971 --> 30:27.065
going through
this bad time lately

30:27.708 --> 30:29.835
and somehow she's...

30:30.711 --> 30:32.611
Well, things

30:33.447 --> 30:35.381
just aren't
the same between them

30:35.449 --> 30:37.747
and he doesn't know
quite what to do about it.

30:37.818 --> 30:41.413
Mmm-hmm.
Well, what does
he want to do about it?

30:41.923 --> 30:44.517
Well, he's thought about it,
a lot.

30:44.792 --> 30:45.781
And

30:45.960 --> 30:47.928
he knows she's confused.

30:48.896 --> 30:51.091
Why ruin a great friendship?

30:51.165 --> 30:52.393
Mmm-hmm.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.658
Well, he could talk to her.

30:55.970 --> 30:57.733
Help her to see
what's happening.

30:58.806 --> 31:01.434
And explain to her that
his feelings about her
haven't changed

31:01.509 --> 31:03.443
and that he still
sees her as a friend.

31:04.912 --> 31:06.004
Talk to her, huh?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.105
Or he could
just leave it alone.

31:08.549 --> 31:11.541
Keep on being
the same around her
as he's always been.

31:12.153 --> 31:13.415
And then wait.

31:13.521 --> 31:16.649
Just wait
for her to realize that
she's not in love with him.

31:16.724 --> 31:18.157
That's what I'd do.

31:18.226 --> 31:19.215
Yeah?

31:19.360 --> 31:20.486
Definitely.

31:21.562 --> 31:23.860
Thanks, T.C.
I'm gonna be late.

31:23.998 --> 31:24.987
T. C: Oh, hey.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.960
Tell your friend, anytime.

31:28.035 --> 31:29.525
Thanks.

31:32.306 --> 31:35.070
The important thing
is to just be yourself.

31:35.142 --> 31:37.610
There's absolutely
no reason to be nervous.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.578
Nervous?
I'm hardly nervous, Agatha.

31:39.647 --> 31:42.514
Merely excited
by the prospect
of seeing old friends.

31:43.017 --> 31:45.247
Can you see that
from the doorway,
do you think?

31:45.319 --> 31:48.083
They'll be able
to tell that it is you
and General Montgomery,

31:48.155 --> 31:49.850
if that's what you mean.

31:52.059 --> 31:54.084
Early.

31:57.031 --> 32:00.159
Jonathan, you don't need
all these reinforcements.

32:00.234 --> 32:03.601
You're doing the right thing
by telling your friends
the truth.

32:03.804 --> 32:07.501
And if they've
got any mettle at all,
they'll admire you for it.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.608
Yes, yes.
You're quite right.

32:09.777 --> 32:11.404
Stiff upper lip and all that.

32:11.479 --> 32:12.844
Exactly.

32:17.551 --> 32:20.987
The honorable Gridley Parsloe,
Sir Freddie Baxter,

32:21.055 --> 32:23.250
and Lord Binky Smythe-White,
sir.

32:27.428 --> 32:30.420
J. Q? J.Q., old sport!

32:30.498 --> 32:31.624
Binky, I...

32:31.899 --> 32:32.957
Magnum, I...

32:33.034 --> 32:34.899
J.Q., J. Q!

32:34.969 --> 32:39.269
Willing, watchful,
wakeful, temperate and true.

32:39.373 --> 32:42.399
Steady on
through fair and foul,

32:42.476 --> 32:45.411
Sandhurst through and through.

32:47.682 --> 32:49.877
You haven't forgotten
your old friends then,
have you?

32:49.950 --> 32:51.417
No, no. Certainly not.

32:51.485 --> 32:52.713
Excuse me, sir.

32:54.121 --> 32:55.588
Luncheon is served.

32:57.358 --> 32:58.985
Luncheon?

32:59.060 --> 33:01.722
Smoked salmon to start.
Cream of tomato soup.

33:02.196 --> 33:04.926
Scottish beef
with horseradish.
Yorkshire pudding.

33:04.999 --> 33:06.626
Peas, leaks and cabbage.

33:06.701 --> 33:10.432
Lemon mousse
and a trifle to finish.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.202
Lovely.

33:14.375 --> 33:16.935
That's a regular
English luncheon.

33:19.647 --> 33:21.239
Good God, what's that?

33:23.250 --> 33:25.741
That would be
your helicopter, sir.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.993
J.Q., you devil.
You never mentioned
a helicopter.

33:38.466 --> 33:41.594
I took the liberty
of asking your pilot
to stand by

33:41.669 --> 33:44.934
on the off chance
you might like to show
your guests around.

33:47.074 --> 33:48.063
Magnum.

33:49.477 --> 33:51.172
No, no, I can't.

33:51.245 --> 33:52.906
Oh, come on, J.Q.

33:52.980 --> 33:55.141
Where's the old adventurous
spirit, old boy?

33:55.216 --> 33:57.343
I mean, the bloody
cream of tomato soup
can wait.

33:57.418 --> 33:58.510
It's not the soup.

33:58.586 --> 33:59.883
Well, what, then?

33:59.954 --> 34:01.785
Go ahead, Jonathan.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.216
You can say it.

34:05.493 --> 34:06.482
Yes.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.554
You're quite right, Agatha.
I can.

34:13.234 --> 34:15.293
Last one in the chopper
is a rotten egg.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.774
Oh, dear!

34:28.315 --> 34:29.304
Damn it!

34:30.418 --> 34:31.407
Damn it!

34:32.219 --> 34:35.016
They can't keep
doing this to you, Carol.

34:35.523 --> 34:38.253
Well, I think they're just
trying to scare me, Steve.

34:38.324 --> 34:40.657
Yeah, well,
I think we ought
to go out there.

34:40.795 --> 34:41.887
I'd like to call Thomas.

34:41.962 --> 34:44.054
No, no, no.
We got to throw this
right back in their faces.

34:44.130 --> 34:45.621
They wanna know scared.

34:45.699 --> 34:47.632
No, I don't think
it's a good idea
to go out there.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.635
You gotta throw it
right back at them,
Carol.

34:49.703 --> 34:50.965
You can't let them know
you're scared.

34:51.038 --> 34:52.369
That's what they want.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.600
Believe me, Carol.

34:54.041 --> 34:55.735
I know how to deal
with these people.

34:55.810 --> 34:57.505
I can handle this for you.

35:00.381 --> 35:01.814
But, look,

35:04.552 --> 35:06.645
if it'll make you
feel better,

35:07.288 --> 35:08.448
call Thomas.

35:10.791 --> 35:13.760
And I got the information
on that license plate for you.

35:13.828 --> 35:15.295
You got it already?

35:15.362 --> 35:17.353
Yep. It's registered
to a guy named Moody.

35:17.431 --> 35:19.626
Middle initial is H.
It's all I could get,

35:19.700 --> 35:21.429
but take a look
at that address.

35:21.502 --> 35:22.662
City Prosecutor's Office?

35:22.736 --> 35:23.828
Yeah, I know.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.464
<i>Hey, Thomas.</i>
<i>This is your buddy,</i>
<i>Rambling Reed.</i>

35:26.540 --> 35:28.269
<i>We hit pay dirt</i>
<i>on the airwaves.</i>

35:28.342 --> 35:31.072
<i>I got your friend's dog</i>
<i>in the studio with me now.</i>

35:31.145 --> 35:32.772
<i>Can you send somebody</i>
<i>over here to pick her up?</i>

35:32.847 --> 35:34.678
Rick?
Hey, I'm on my way.

35:36.450 --> 35:38.645
The guy who delivers her mail.
What?

35:38.752 --> 35:41.346
She said his name was Moody.
He's the connection.

35:41.422 --> 35:43.947
<i>Thomas, they've</i>
<i>sent me another package.</i>

35:44.024 --> 35:45.116
<i>It's Chelsea.</i>

35:45.192 --> 35:47.387
<i>It isn't Chelsea.</i>
<i>It's a stuffed toy,</i>

35:47.461 --> 35:49.019
<i>but it looks</i>
<i>just like Chelsea.</i>

35:49.096 --> 35:51.223
<i>Steve's taking me out</i>
<i>to the Lazarus Ranch.</i>

35:51.298 --> 35:53.459
<i>And Thomas,</i>
<i>I think they have my dog.</i>

35:53.701 --> 35:54.861
Trouble.

35:55.102 --> 35:57.161
I don't think so.
You gonna get the dog?

35:57.238 --> 35:58.830
Hey, I'm out of here.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.942
Where's Carol?

36:09.016 --> 36:10.108
What are you talking about?

36:10.184 --> 36:11.913
I know about the packages,
Moody.

36:11.986 --> 36:13.146
Oh, man!

36:13.521 --> 36:16.354
I knew somebody was going
to try to pin that on me.

36:16.423 --> 36:17.890
I deliver the mail.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.817
I don't know anything
about what gets in it.

36:19.894 --> 36:22.795
That's why
you're packing your bags,
'cause you're so innocent?

36:22.863 --> 36:23.989
Damn right.

36:24.331 --> 36:27.823
Somebody's trying to set me up
by sending weird packages
to her.

36:28.135 --> 36:30.035
Well, I'm not sticking around
for the fall.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.595
I haven't seen Carol Baldwin.
Now, get out of here.

36:32.673 --> 36:34.800
She and Steve Elliott
were on their way out here.

36:34.875 --> 36:35.864
Elliott?

36:38.679 --> 36:40.271
You know Steve Elliott?

36:42.316 --> 36:43.681
Tell him, Moody.

36:47.721 --> 36:50.588
If you don't
want to talk to me,
you can talk to the police.

36:50.658 --> 36:51.682
Moody!

36:52.192 --> 36:54.558
I don't know
anything about it.

36:54.728 --> 36:55.820
I don't believe you!

36:55.896 --> 36:58.057
Moody, you want
the police out here?

36:59.833 --> 37:02.165
Steve Elliott
was a customer of his.

37:03.203 --> 37:05.103
Speed mostly.
A little coke.

37:05.839 --> 37:07.466
But Moody cut him off.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.843
He was getting
a little strange.

37:09.910 --> 37:11.810
Tell him our whole business.

37:12.379 --> 37:14.677
If they find him,
you don't have to go.

37:14.748 --> 37:16.010
Where are they?

37:16.517 --> 37:18.280
I know where they might be.

37:18.352 --> 37:19.546
I'll take you there.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.457
We'll talk again.

37:27.294 --> 37:29.387
Sunshine, be careful.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.392
You haven't seen him
when he's strung out.

37:41.324 --> 37:43.588
What makes you think
they'll be up here?

37:43.660 --> 37:45.321
Steve used
to bring me up here

37:45.395 --> 37:47.795
whenever he'd come
buy something from Moody.

37:47.864 --> 37:50.628
He liked it up here.
He was funny.

37:50.934 --> 37:51.923
And nice.

37:52.202 --> 37:54.966
The way you were
with that girl at the prison.

37:55.138 --> 37:57.265
You could tell
you were connected.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.806
That's how I thought
about me and Steve.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.005
But that's not
how it was at all.

38:11.521 --> 38:14.615
You're on your own from here.
I'm gonna hitch my way
back to the ranch.

38:14.691 --> 38:15.953
Wait a minute.

38:18.762 --> 38:19.751
Thanks.

38:34.544 --> 38:38.640
You see, Carol, I tried
to get you to understand
that you could depend on me.

38:38.915 --> 38:40.906
That when things got bad,
you could lean on me.

38:40.984 --> 38:44.750
That's why I sent you
that stuff in the mail and
followed you in the stairwell.

38:47.957 --> 38:49.618
I only want you to need me.

38:50.026 --> 38:51.288
Steve,
if I would've known...

38:51.361 --> 38:52.521
I'm talking!

38:56.199 --> 39:00.727
I tried to get you to see
that when things were bad,
when you got scared,

39:00.804 --> 39:02.294
you could come to me.

39:02.372 --> 39:04.033
I only want
to take care of you.

39:04.107 --> 39:06.667
Then don't do this to me.
Please let me go.

39:06.743 --> 39:09.177
I'm in charge here!
Do you understand?

39:14.350 --> 39:15.339
Do you?

39:18.521 --> 39:19.510
No, no.

39:20.857 --> 39:22.825
No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:23.359 --> 39:25.190
No, I would never hurt you.

39:25.595 --> 39:27.222
No, I couldn't do that.

39:27.931 --> 39:29.057
I love you.

39:30.233 --> 39:31.222
Carol.

39:46.316 --> 39:47.305
Oh, yeah.

39:47.884 --> 39:49.875
Yeah, that's much better.

39:50.453 --> 39:51.943
That's the way
it's gonna be from now on.

39:52.021 --> 39:53.454
You're gonna like it here.

39:55.492 --> 39:59.553
I would really like
some water.

40:00.463 --> 40:01.452
Please?

40:02.632 --> 40:03.894
Oh, well, I...

40:04.701 --> 40:06.896
I've got to go out
to the water tank.

40:08.104 --> 40:09.196
Thank you.

40:26.456 --> 40:27.855
Thomas.

40:27.924 --> 40:29.414
You okay?

40:29.492 --> 40:32.518
Yes, I can do it.
I can do it.
I can do it. My feet.

40:33.129 --> 40:34.323
My feet.

40:42.272 --> 40:43.330
Come on.

40:52.949 --> 40:54.177
Carol!

41:20.243 --> 41:22.108
It's all right.
I tripped. I tripped.
I thought...

41:23.947 --> 41:25.574
Here, put your arm around me.

41:25.648 --> 41:27.775
Oh, why did this
have to happen?
These dumb shoes.

41:27.850 --> 41:31.149
This is supposed to happen
to bimbos in movies and TV,
not to me.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.312
I'm too smart for this.

41:32.388 --> 41:34.356
Smart has nothing
to do with it.

41:34.857 --> 41:37.792
Courage
in the face of adversity.

41:37.860 --> 41:41.762
Moral integrity
in the face of temptation.

41:42.465 --> 41:46.094
Those are the principles
which made the Empire great.

41:47.604 --> 41:48.593
Tea?

41:49.138 --> 41:51.629
Yes, yes. Thank you very much,
my dear.

41:52.442 --> 41:53.909
Where was I?

41:54.510 --> 41:58.241
Something about courage
and moral integrity.

41:58.748 --> 42:02.616
That's it, exactly.
Honesty, honesty.
That's the ticket.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.754
You're quite right,
you know.

42:06.623 --> 42:09.057
Of course, I'm right.
I'm a Sandhurst man.

42:09.125 --> 42:12.458
Willing, watchful, wakeful,
temperate and true.

42:12.528 --> 42:14.428
Archibald, please.

42:16.566 --> 42:17.555
Enough.

42:21.804 --> 42:26.241
I don't believe that
anybody has dared to
call me Archibald

42:26.576 --> 42:28.635
since my first year
at Sandhurst.

42:28.845 --> 42:30.870
I'm sure there are
a great number of things

42:30.947 --> 42:32.812
people have not dared
to say to you.

42:34.017 --> 42:36.281
But a point comes when you

42:36.419 --> 42:39.354
cannot carry out
the charade any longer.

42:44.727 --> 42:46.820
I don't own this estate.

42:47.930 --> 42:50.558
I am merely an employee here.

42:50.833 --> 42:53.666
A majordomo, as it were.

42:54.704 --> 42:57.264
But the very best,
I know how to be.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.740
I am proud of my job.

43:00.543 --> 43:03.603
And I'm proud of the life
I've made for myself.

43:05.715 --> 43:09.742
And I am proud to have
people like Agatha Chumley
call me friend.

43:13.056 --> 43:16.389
And I find,
to my great astonishment,

43:17.226 --> 43:18.750
that it no longer
matters to me

43:18.828 --> 43:21.126
what the lads
of Sandhurst think

43:21.698 --> 43:23.757
of Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

43:30.306 --> 43:32.797
That's quite a speech.

43:36.212 --> 43:39.113
Well, I know you have
a banquet this evening

43:39.182 --> 43:40.979
and I wouldn't
want to be the cause

43:41.050 --> 43:42.517
of your late arrival,
so...

43:42.585 --> 43:44.246
J.Q.

43:45.822 --> 43:46.914
Jonathan.

43:48.224 --> 43:49.919
You've made your speech.

43:52.095 --> 43:55.861
Now perhaps you'll listen
to one that I have been

43:56.499 --> 43:59.195
rehearsing for
many, many years.

44:03.272 --> 44:05.900
It's about a man,

44:07.243 --> 44:08.801
a friend of mine,

44:10.146 --> 44:12.046
who has spent a lifetime

44:13.049 --> 44:15.449
paying
for an appalling mistake,

44:16.786 --> 44:21.382
which I made
and could not own up to.

44:50.853 --> 44:51.945
If we don't get out of here...

44:52.021 --> 44:53.648
We're going to
get out of here.

44:53.723 --> 44:54.849
Okay. Okay.

44:55.858 --> 44:57.382
I want to tell you something.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.621
That maybe
for a little while there,

44:59.695 --> 45:02.357
that maybe
I was making you up

45:02.899 --> 45:04.298
in my mind.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.627
You know,
the knight in shining armor?

45:06.702 --> 45:07.760
I'm not.

45:07.837 --> 45:09.668
Oh, I know. I know.

45:12.175 --> 45:14.439
Can I try it now?
Let me try it. Okay.
Yeah. Take it easy.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.414
Easy, easy.
Okay, it's gonna be fine.

45:21.784 --> 45:25.049
No, no, it's not.
Now sit down, sit down.
Oh, Tom, Tom.

45:25.121 --> 45:26.748
What am I gonna do?

45:28.691 --> 45:31.717
We're never going
to outdistance him
with me carrying you.

45:31.794 --> 45:32.818
What are we gonna do?

45:32.895 --> 45:34.123
Okay, Plan B.

45:36.899 --> 45:37.888
What?

45:40.636 --> 45:42.627
Except this one
might get scary.

46:16.973 --> 46:19.999
Come on, just a little closer.
Come on.

46:43.566 --> 46:44.726
You shouldn't have left me.

46:52.208 --> 46:54.369
What took you so long?

46:54.977 --> 46:55.966
What?

46:56.045 --> 46:57.205
What took you so long?

46:57.280 --> 46:59.180
As soon as he was in sight,
that was the plan.

46:59.248 --> 47:00.977
Would you watch where
you're pointing that thing?

47:01.050 --> 47:02.312
I don't know
what to do with it.

47:02.385 --> 47:03.784
He stood there for an hour.
I could've been killed!

47:03.853 --> 47:05.411
Well,
he was in the wrong spot!

47:05.488 --> 47:07.149
It wouldn't have done you
any good if I would have

47:07.223 --> 47:08.485
jumped too soon
and broke my leg.

47:08.557 --> 47:11.151
Don't you throw
that in my face!

47:11.227 --> 47:13.923
I didn't mean to break my leg,
you know.

47:16.699 --> 47:18.690
Oh, Thomas, we're safe.

47:18.768 --> 47:19.860
Oh, God.

47:21.671 --> 47:22.968
Ah, you were incredible.

47:23.039 --> 47:24.131
Oh, no, no!

47:24.206 --> 47:26.674
That took a lot of courage.
No, it was you
that took the real risk.

47:26.742 --> 47:27.902
Carol, please.

47:28.577 --> 47:30.340
Do you think you could
take a compliment?

47:30.913 --> 47:31.902
Just once?

47:34.083 --> 47:35.311
Thank you.

47:35.551 --> 47:36.745
You're welcome.
