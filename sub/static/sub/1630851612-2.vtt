02:29.450 --> 02:32.584
What was it about "alter ego"
that appealed to you

02:32.586 --> 02:34.486
and made you want
to perform on the show?

02:34.588 --> 02:38.190
It's been a long, long,
long journey for me to get here,
you know?

02:38.225 --> 02:39.625
I tried music one way,

and it didn't work out
the way I wanted it to,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.401

The record label,
they made sure I sang r&b music,

03:16.497 --> 03:18.530
but I always wanted to sing
rock n' roll.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.466
I grew up around it, always
heard my father singing it.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.302
Now that I'm singing rock

03:23.337 --> 03:26.171
it's a fresh new chance

- I want to go to that place!
- Yes! Come on over.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.792
So what brings you
here tonight

11:33.794 --> 11:37.362
and how do you blend and
collaborate with your alter ego?

11:37.431 --> 11:39.230
Well, I am here tonight

11:39.232 --> 11:42.100
because I have struggled
with confidence my whole life.

11:42.169 --> 11:46.404
- But you know what?
No more to that.
- I love that.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.806
All right, let's take it away,
safara. You ready?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.641
Yes, I'm ready.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.312
- I feel like I can still
feel her nerves a bit.
- Yeah.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.228
Any nerves
that may have been there

13:50.230 --> 13:52.397
seemed to have disappeared
about halfway through the song.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.833
- There was--
- confident vocal.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.035
Rocsi:
That's what I'm talking about.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.205
Safara, you're out here
right now embodying
all this confidence.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.341
I have all the confidence
in the world right now, girl.
I'm never going back.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.876
- Unh-uh.
- Love that. I love that.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.144
That's what it's all about.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.547
- She's embodying the hell
out of this alter ego.
- Yes!

14:09.583 --> 14:11.182
Whatever you did
back wherever you are,
you keep doing your thing,

14:11.251 --> 14:14.219
- because that was awesome.
- Thank you, nick. Thank you.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.954
Loverboy, how are
you feeling up there?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.223
- Oh, I'm blessed
to be here, baby.
- All right.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.226
Well, judges,
it's time for your votes.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.462
Did safara knock
the loverboy off the diamond?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.931
Will.I.Am,
I'm gonna start with you.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
You are spectacular.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.203
Thank you so much, will.
Whoo!

14:32.272 --> 14:36.174
I like mr. Boy, but there's
just something about

14:36.276 --> 14:38.176
the marriage between
safara's voice

14:38.278 --> 14:41.946
and her alter ego
that I believe.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.581
I believe that.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.351
The complete package was there
in safara for me.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.253
Okay, that's one for safara.

14:48.255 --> 14:51.456
- Safara: Whoo!
- All right, alanis,
what do you think?

14:51.524 --> 14:55.627
I love the loverboy,
and I loved everything that
he seems to represent,

14:55.629 --> 14:59.397
but safara for me
really embodied her alter ego.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.333
Even in the face
of her being debilitated
by nerves in the past,

15:02.369 --> 15:06.237
I do think you have
what it takes to be the next
generation superstar.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.406
- Thank you.
- So safara gets on
that diamond.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.676
- Whoo!
- Thank you, alanis.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.278
Rocsi: Grimes?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.647
I can tell you're very shy
when you're talking to us,

15:15.649 --> 15:18.049
but when you performing,
you were just totally in it.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.651
Thank you so much.

15:19.653 --> 15:22.086
I don't know, like, you feel
like the exact kind of person

15:22.188 --> 15:24.656
who maybe, like,
this technology is good for.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.492
And I think the loverboy,
really entertaining
in the moment,

15:27.560 --> 15:30.528
but, like, safara felt
more like something that
I was emotionally invested in,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.031
and I have to put safara
on the diamond.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.668
- Thank you!
- Rocsi: That's three.

15:36.670 --> 15:37.602
You already know
what that means.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.504
Safara, you're going up
on that diamond, girl.

15:39.539 --> 15:43.441
Yeah.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.043
Remember, whichever alter ego

15:45.078 --> 15:46.511
is up there by
the end of the night

15:46.513 --> 15:48.346
is guaranteed a place
in the next round.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.516
Unfortunately, that does mean
that the loverboy

15:51.551 --> 15:54.152
is at the mercy
of the audience vote.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.187
Now things are just
starting to heat up.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.557
We've still got performances
by three more alter egos.

15:59.592 --> 16:03.261
Who can sell out stadiums
and become a digital sensation?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.129
The search continues
after this.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.340
Rocsi:
Welcome back to "alter ego."

16:15.342 --> 16:17.942
judges, are you happy
with what you're seeing so far?

16:17.978 --> 16:20.144
These performances tonight
are blowing my mind.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.314
The level of talent
is bananas.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.515
Will.I.Am:
I'm curious who they are,

16:24.517 --> 16:27.452
but I really just want to know

16:27.520 --> 16:30.355
and get to just believe
the character.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.255
Mm.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.926
It's to introduce
our next alter ego.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.028
It's wolfgang champagne.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.305
What's up, wolfgang champagne?

16:47.307 --> 16:51.309
Yeah, wolfgang champagne!
But you can call me wolfie.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.112
- Yeah!
- Wolfie it is.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.380
I might put you on the diamond
just for your name.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.949
- I love the name.
- Well, let's just
forget the singing.

16:57.951 --> 16:58.983
I'll go stand up there.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.252
What does the name represent?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.254
Well, I'm actually a werewolf.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.056
I'm not a big werewolf.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.493
I was, like, bitten by
a chihuahua about 500 years ago,

17:08.495 --> 17:11.029
but I don't look a day over 350.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.265
And so how long you been
singing though?

17:14.267 --> 17:18.636
Oh, about 478 years I think.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.506
'cause I started howling,
and then I went,

17:21.541 --> 17:23.508
hey, I'm pretty good at this.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.210
Aroo! And then I just
started singing.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.714
What brought you
to "alter ego?"

17:29.749 --> 17:33.551
"alter ego" seems to be a place
where everybody's welcome,

17:33.586 --> 17:36.554
and there's not many places
like that in the world anymore.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.659
I'm matthew lord,
and I'm a truck driver.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.196
I am 60,
and I need an alter ego

17:45.231 --> 17:48.332
because I was thinking
my life was winding down.

17:48.435 --> 17:52.136
And I think "alter ego" has
given me a chance to wind it up.

17:52.205 --> 17:56.074
25, 26 years, I had
a professional singing career.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.710
But in 2001, after 9/11,

17:59.779 --> 18:02.613
I had about six
or seven jobs cancel.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.249
So now family
won't have insurance.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.384
I have mortgage payments.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.585
So I'm looking
through the paper,

18:07.620 --> 18:10.655
and that's when I decided
to first go and get certified

18:10.657 --> 18:12.223
and go to trucking school.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.559
And I've been driving
a truck ever since.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.260
Start there.
I'll put you there.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.696
The producers put you
in your motion capture suit,

18:18.731 --> 18:20.665
and I look like a big sausage.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.733
Then they put
all these sensors on you,

18:22.769 --> 18:26.537
and they put,
like, a robot camera
hooked to your head,

18:26.573 --> 18:28.106
which is making the face

18:28.141 --> 18:31.109
of your alter ego do everything
you technically do,

18:31.144 --> 18:32.310
but look a lot prettier.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.611
So that's the judges
and that's the host?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.146
That's correct.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.215
I don't want the judges
to know anything about me.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.783
I don't sound
like anybody else.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.085
I think it will take them
by surprise.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.821
Two reasons why
I wanna win "alter ego."

18:43.823 --> 18:45.823
I don't wanna
drive a truck anymore.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.460
Also,
it'll let me continue doing
what I truly love doing,

18:49.462 --> 18:52.296
and I can still be relevant.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.265
And that's-- I get--

18:54.267 --> 18:55.466
your show...

18:58.505 --> 19:02.840
...Um, has made me
feel relevant.

19:02.942 --> 19:06.444
I never thought I would have
this feeling again.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.413
Okay, we're ready to see
what you have in store.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.215
- All right.
- Nick: Let's go, wolfie.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.819
Do you think he's old?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.787
I have no clue.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.389
He sounds, like, 75.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.434
( singing "my heart will go on"
in italian )

19:30.470 --> 19:31.702
what the hell?

19:35.675 --> 19:39.544
( continues in italian )

19:41.848 --> 19:43.581
yeah!

20:35.235 --> 20:38.836
( vocalizing )

20:38.905 --> 20:40.671
yeah!

20:40.673 --> 20:42.206
- ( vocalizing )
- whoo!

20:42.208 --> 20:44.442
Wolfie's actually got
a good voice.

20:44.477 --> 20:48.312
( vocalizing )

20:50.516 --> 20:54.885
- yeah!
- Whoo!

20:54.954 --> 20:56.287
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

20:56.322 --> 20:58.189
Wolfie!

20:58.191 --> 21:02.260
Wolfie, wolfie,
wolfie, wolfie!

21:02.262 --> 21:03.728
Wow.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.664
That voice was the last thing
I expected to happen.

21:06.699 --> 21:10.735
I ain't had this much fun
since the world was young.
I thank all of you.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.904
That was, like, one of the
weirdest things I've ever seen,

21:14.007 --> 21:15.706
- and that's a compliment.
- Thank you!

21:16.909 --> 21:19.677
- Rocsi: There you go.
- Weird's good.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.579
Judges,
I don't know about y'all,

21:21.581 --> 21:23.581
but I'm definitely hanging out
with wolfie after this.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.383
- Yeah!
- First round's on me.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.752
It's gotta be.
I ain't got no prize money yet.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.426
And now the moment of truth.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.828
Judges, it's time
for you guys to vote.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.797
Who deserves to be
on the diamond,

21:39.832 --> 21:42.867
the only place that guarantees
safety in this competition?

21:42.902 --> 21:45.236
- Nick?
- It's so tough,

21:45.238 --> 21:49.740
because I was so moved
by safara's performance.

21:49.842 --> 21:53.678
But I felt something
just now with wolfie that--

21:53.680 --> 21:55.079
I mean,
it was just so much fun.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.849
In some crazy weird way,
you're embodying this
alter ego right now.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.620
But I still give the nod to
safara to stay on the diamond.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.422
Rocsi: Okay. Wow.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.626
So wolfie's clearly
a favorite in the room

22:08.661 --> 22:10.828
- with the audience.
- ( cheering )

22:10.863 --> 22:14.031
and he's also
a really beautiful singer.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.666
That means a lot
coming from you.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.468
Not that--
nick, I love you, too,

22:17.537 --> 22:18.836
but it means more
coming from her.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.273
Understand.
I feel the same way.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.276
Safara, I loved her voice,

22:25.311 --> 22:28.612
and think she could potentially
be the next digital superstar.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.683
- So I'm gonna keep
safara up there.
- Rocsi: Grimes?

22:32.685 --> 22:35.953
Okay, maybe she's, like,
better at singing,

22:35.988 --> 22:39.990
but to me, that was just,
like, the best art
I've seen tonight.

22:39.992 --> 22:44.495
Like, I feel like
his humanity is, like, vibing
through the character a lot,

22:44.497 --> 22:47.498
and so I'm going to vote
for wolfgang.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.837
Will.I.Am,
it's all up to you.

22:52.839 --> 22:56.474
Wolfie,
you my favorite person
for real, for real,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.309
because you've given me
so much flavors.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.478
Like, american flavor,

23:00.480 --> 23:02.747
but then you sung like you
was straight up from Italy.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.749
Right.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.386
And then your outfit looks
like you robbed everybody
from "game of thrones."

23:11.023 --> 23:14.592
but, dang,
safara came with it,
with it, with it.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.427
This is getting worse for me,
isn't it?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.430
Will.I.Am:
And if I had to imagine

23:19.465 --> 23:22.666
what a next generation superstar
would look like and sing like,

23:22.702 --> 23:25.669
they would sing
like safara for me.

23:25.705 --> 23:29.306
- Rocsi: I'm so sorry,
wolfgang champagne.
- Wolfie!

23:29.342 --> 23:32.076
When we come back, we find out
which four alter egos

23:32.111 --> 23:33.644
are advancing
to the next round

23:33.679 --> 23:35.946
and who will be revealed
to the judges.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.948
Things are about
to get really real, y'all.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.084
Oh, boy!

23:40.153 --> 23:42.987
Safara is one of the most
phenomenal singers I've heard.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.989
She deserves every moment
on that diamond.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.724
I think
I'm good enough to stay.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.858
You know,
I don't want to go home.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.567
- ( crew chatter )

24:00.940 --> 24:01.939
Rocsi: Now here's the deal.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.007
The judges don't meet the person

24:03.075 --> 24:04.942
behind our next alter ego,

24:05.011 --> 24:08.012
but you at home
will meet him right now.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.613
It's kai.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.717
I wanna be
in a boy band so much.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.420
When it comes to, like,
a boy band member,
they're tall, skinny.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.823
But I got a baby face
and I'm short.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.090
I already have the voice
of a boy bander,

24:20.159 --> 24:21.826
but now I just need a body,

24:21.861 --> 24:23.727
and an alter ego
gives me that body.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.663
My name is kobe vang,

24:25.698 --> 24:27.598

24:36.476 --> 24:38.742
to take care of,
you know, my family.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.711
So "alter ego" is such
a great opportunity for me

24:40.713 --> 24:43.547
because, you know, just to
be able to do what I wanna do

28:41.053 --> 28:43.287
like, futuristic superstar.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.824

I think I connected more
with safara as an artist.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.727

28:49.829 --> 28:52.663

keep safara on the diamond.

- Connection is everything.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.439
- Will.I.Am?
- Can you just give us a riff

29:17.456 --> 29:21.825

it was terrific.

And because of that, even though
safara's freaking awesome,

29:28.100 --> 29:32.736

to really see his voice shine.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.286
in terms of her
stepping into it,

to the boy bander in me,

30:04.069 --> 30:06.036
despite
the backstreet boy thing.

30:06.071 --> 30:10.040
This could be the thing that,
like, messes you up, kai.

30:10.075 --> 30:12.709
You should've lied, bro.
You should've lied.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.914
I thought his stage presence
was really phenomenal,

30:16.949 --> 30:21.318
but there was something
about safara's connection
with her alter ego.

30:21.353 --> 30:25.923
So I'm voting to keep
safara on the diamond.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.925

30:27.960 --> 30:30.828

- Give it up for, kai, guys.
- Good job, man.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.235
Rocsi:
Find out who comes out on top
and who will reveal

30:38.237 --> 30:41.238
their true identity
to the judges after this.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.941
I have these imaginations
of what they all look like,

30:43.943 --> 30:46.076
but the truth is
I have no idea.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.355
Rocsi: Welcome back
to "alter ego."

30:58.390 --> 31:03.327
we have one more alter ego
and one more performance.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.230

31:22.982 --> 31:26.550
I didn't think I had
what it took to be part
of the music industry,

31:26.552 --> 31:30.320
and having an alter ego
will finally get rid

31:30.356 --> 31:32.522
of some of those insecurities
and fears that I have.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.313

32:06.091 --> 32:08.358

32:08.394 --> 32:13.096

32:22.274 --> 32:25.309
It's my birth flower
and it also means "star."

32:25.344 --> 32:27.577

I was told I was a star,

32:27.579 --> 32:30.347

hoping to be here

32:30.349 --> 32:32.582

35:13.312 --> 35:15.612
- Good one.
- Right?

35:15.614 --> 35:19.616
But was it enough to knock
safara off the diamond?

35:19.718 --> 35:21.785
Safara, you've been up there
since you performed.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.386
You getting
comfortable up there?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.388
Oh, I'm loving the view
from up here.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.659
This is a huge decision
for the judges right now.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.095
The alter ego
they put on the diamond

35:32.131 --> 35:35.265
will automatically advance
to the next round.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.267
Grimes, we're gonna
start with you.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.337
I mean, this is really rough,

35:40.405 --> 35:43.640
'cause I think you guys
are my two favorites.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.510
Aster, I really like
how much personality you have,

35:46.545 --> 35:49.746
so I am gonna vote for aster.

35:49.748 --> 35:53.083
- Okay.
- Thank you.

35:53.118 --> 35:58.221
I love the fiery aster flowers,
but for me,

35:58.257 --> 36:01.658
the person that I connected
with their alter ego,
it was safara.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.660
Rocsi: Okay.

36:03.695 --> 36:07.230
So we have one vote for
each alter ego right now.

36:07.232 --> 36:11.868
- Alanis?
- Safara, I absolutely
love the freedom

36:11.904 --> 36:14.437
and sensuality
of your performance,

36:14.473 --> 36:18.542
and, aster, I very much loved
the continuity between

36:18.577 --> 36:20.744
your alter ego and your voice.

36:20.779 --> 36:24.514
I am going to err on aster
being on the diamond.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.116
Okay.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.619
Thank you. Thank you.

36:29.655 --> 36:33.623
Nick, this is a huge decision,

36:33.659 --> 36:35.859
because if aster
gets on the diamond,

36:35.861 --> 36:41.498
she automatically goes
to the head-to-head round.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.466
Safara really has
just such a beautiful voice,

36:43.502 --> 36:46.870
and she's deserved to be on
this diamond this entire time.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.440
But aster,
there was something more raw.

36:50.475 --> 36:51.875
It was taking
all those insecurities

36:51.910 --> 36:54.177
that you've experienced
and channeling them,

36:54.179 --> 36:58.348
and for me, that's what makes
that next generation superstar.

36:58.350 --> 37:02.319
And that's what just,
oh, so slightly

37:02.387 --> 37:03.687
put it over the top for me.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.922
So I do think that aster
deserves to be on the diamond.

37:06.024 --> 37:09.893
- Rocsi: There we go!
- Whoo! I'm so excited!

37:11.296 --> 37:14.364
Congratulations, aster.

37:14.433 --> 37:18.368
You've managed to knock safara
off the diamond

37:18.437 --> 37:21.671
and are safe
from the elimination.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.341
So awesome.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.811
You will automatically advance
to the next round,

37:27.879 --> 37:30.747
while safara will join
the other three alter egos

37:30.782 --> 37:32.716
at the mercy
of the audience vote.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.652
And now,
our in-studio audience

37:35.687 --> 37:38.822
will vote for their top two
favorite performances tonight.

37:38.857 --> 37:41.958
Then our judges will decide

37:42.027 --> 37:46.529
which one of the remaining
two should stay
and who should go home.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.598
- Ahh!
- The stress.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.738
<i> Talent, get to your marks.</i>

37:54.840 --> 37:56.706
<i> Everybody, places.</i>

37:56.742 --> 37:59.242
<i> Going to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

38:04.616 --> 38:06.349
Four contestants remain.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.885
The audience votes
have been counted,

38:08.954 --> 38:12.455
and now I can reveal
that the two alter egos

38:12.491 --> 38:14.491
advancing
to the next round are...

38:22.934 --> 38:26.636
- Wolfgang champagne!
- ( cheering )

38:26.638 --> 38:28.305
- wolfie!
- Crowd: Wolfie!
Wolfie! Wolfie!

38:28.307 --> 38:31.474
( wolfie howling )

38:33.612 --> 38:35.578
and safara!

38:35.614 --> 38:37.580
<i> ♪ I do my hair toss </i>

38:37.582 --> 38:38.982
<i> ♪ check my nails </i>

38:38.984 --> 38:40.350
<i> ♪ baby, how you feel? </i>

38:40.385 --> 38:42.452
<i> ♪ good as hell </i>

38:42.454 --> 38:45.221
-<i> ♪ hair toss  </i>
- congratulations.

38:45.257 --> 38:49.259
You two, we'll see you
at the head-to-head.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.465
And now it's in
your hands, judges.

38:55.467 --> 38:59.836
- The torture.
- It's time to make
your decisions.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.572
I know, nick, it's painful.
I know, I know.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.774
- Dang, this is--
- this is tricky now.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.643
That riff was pretty terrific.

39:06.712 --> 39:11.014
You wanna save kai?
I don't know.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.550
I would actually
save the loverboy.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.687
The loverboy, just in
terms of being a stronger
vocal performance for me?

39:17.723 --> 39:18.888
Alanis:
Yeah, the loverboy.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.524
I think that's my vote.

39:25.497 --> 39:29.366
Rocsi:
Kai and the loverboy remain.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.634
Who is going home?

39:31.670 --> 39:33.336
Judges, what is your decision?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.872
Alanis: There's no way
to feel okay right now.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.475
I mean, it's a really,
really, really tough call.

39:38.510 --> 39:42.645
You know, kai,
I think we all enjoyed
that boy band energy.

39:42.714 --> 39:47.384
But the loverboy, we all just
loved the tone of your voice,

39:47.386 --> 39:51.488
and so we're going to
save the loverboy.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.890
- Rocsi: Oh, wow!
-
<i> ♪ take my hand </i>

39:53.992 --> 39:56.860
<i> ♪ we'll make it, I swear </i>

39:56.895 --> 39:59.028
congratulations!

39:59.064 --> 40:02.399
The loverboy,
the judges have saved you,

40:02.467 --> 40:06.469
and you get to move on
to head-to-head round.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.871
Wow.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.776
I'm sorry,
but that means, kai,

40:12.844 --> 40:15.712
your journey with us
ends here tonight.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.683
I can't help but wanna meet
the real you, man.

40:20.719 --> 40:23.453
We'd love for you
to perform one last time

40:23.522 --> 40:26.656
and for you to reveal
your identity.

40:26.725 --> 40:30.460
- Thank you.
- Give it up for kai.

40:30.495 --> 40:34.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on!

40:34.433 --> 40:36.399
Alanis:
I'm just really curious
what he looks like.

- Thank you so much.
- Awesome!

- Oh, he's so cute.
I don't want him to go.
- I know, I know.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.445
Aww, man.

41:55.480 --> 41:59.382
Judges,
it gives me great honor

41:59.451 --> 42:01.818
to introduce you guys to kobe,

42:01.853 --> 42:04.821
aka kai.

42:07.559 --> 42:10.059
What have you learned
from your alter ego?

42:10.095 --> 42:11.661
I've learned that, you know,

42:11.663 --> 42:14.864
I can still confident
even without an alter ego.

42:14.866 --> 42:19.469
Just being able to
perform right here really
showed it, honestly.

42:19.471 --> 42:23.840
Okay, was this even
who you were imagining

42:23.875 --> 42:26.109
behind the alter ego?

42:26.144 --> 42:28.511
Honestly,
I didn't even allow myself

42:28.513 --> 42:32.148
to even picture in my mind
what you would look like.

42:32.183 --> 42:35.118
You are an amazing singer.
Please don't stop singing.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.186
Whatever it is
you felt being kai,

42:37.188 --> 42:39.022
whatever liberties
that gave you

42:39.124 --> 42:40.790
and whatever freedom
that gave you as a performer,

42:40.825 --> 42:43.826
try and take that with you
in your everyday life, man.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.495
'cause you've got it.
You've got it.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.964
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.468
Kobe, it's been
beyond a pleasure

42:52.504 --> 42:54.837
watching you perform,
hearing your voice.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.606
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.007
That's our two-night premiere.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.743
We'll see you next week.
Good night.

43:00.812 --> 43:04.213
Whoo! Whoo!

43:04.215 --> 43:06.049
Kobe!
