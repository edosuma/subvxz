00:02.460 --> 00:05.295
Okay, Rach,
that's muffin and espresso, 4.50.

00:05.463 --> 00:10.009
Ross, double latte, 2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.885
And, Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.597
So all together that's 12.75.

00:15.765 --> 00:20.227
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.772
How much do I owe?

00:23.940 --> 00:27.109
Oh, that's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

00:27.318 --> 00:30.237
Oh. Great. Well, tell him thanks.

00:30.405 --> 00:35.284
And since Joey seems like such a nice guy,
maybe we could go on a date sometime?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.995
Well, he's not used to women
being so forward...

00:38.163 --> 00:41.081
...but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.252
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.796
Hey, Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?

00:47.964 --> 00:51.216
It will be when you look like that
in a tight skirt.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.802
This is great.
I'm getting more dates than ever.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.805
Wait, you're only giving away free stuff
to the pretty girls?

00:56.973 --> 00:59.099
Joey, that is so gross.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.186
Hmm. How about a scone
on the house, baby?

01:04.188 --> 01:05.355
I'm pretty.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.651
- Hey, does anyone have any gum?
- Oh, I do.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.822
Here. Sorry.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.741
Oh, you know what?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.703
No.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.832
Wait a second.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.590
- I know it's in here somewhere.
- You know what? I'm good. I'm good.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.134
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.719
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

02:17.887 --> 02:21.014
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.349
Aw.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.477
- I'm so sorry that you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.563
I don't get sick.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.024
Getting sick is for weaklings.
It's for pansies.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.194
Honey, no one thinks
that you're a pansy.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.197
But we do think that you need a tissue.

02:40.201 --> 02:42.327
I have not been sick in over three years.

02:45.039 --> 02:49.543
- I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
- I don't need a tissue. I'm fine.

02:49.711 --> 02:54.631
When you put a D at the end of "fine,"
you're not fine.

02:55.925 --> 03:00.804
I'm fine.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.224
You know, it's a really hard word to say.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.948
- Yes?
- Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.784
- Oh, my God, Jill.
- Oh, my God, Rachel.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.244
Oh!

03:24.412 --> 03:26.538
Oh, my God, introduce us.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.707
- This is Chandler.
- Hi.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.250
And you know Monica and Ross.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.753
- Hi.
- And that's Phoebe, and that's Joey.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.755
- Hey. How you doing?
- Don't.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.304
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- Oh.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.639
Which sister is this?

03:43.806 --> 03:46.850
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

03:47.018 --> 03:50.479
- Daddy cut me off.
- Never mind, I got it.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.147
And you know what I said to him?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.567
I said, "I'm gonna hire a lawyer,
sue you and take all your money...

03:55.735 --> 03:57.361
...and then I'm gonna cut you off."

03:58.029 --> 04:01.031
- What did he say?
- He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.366
Ah.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.077
Then he told me to come
and learn the value of money...

04:05.245 --> 04:06.870
...from the one daughter he's proud of.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.455
Oh.

04:09.624 --> 04:14.086
Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me.
My dad's proud of me. Ha, ha.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.630
- Rach?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.175
Hey, honey, so, what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?

04:21.177 --> 04:24.304
- Okay, I bought a boat.
- You bought a boat?

04:25.014 --> 04:28.225
Yeah, but it wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.852
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.566
Jill, I think this is the best thing
that could've ever happened to you.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.860
You've needed to get out
on your own anyway.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.613
And you know, when I did it,
at first I was scared...

04:41.781 --> 04:43.073
...but then look at me now.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.576
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

04:47.745 --> 04:50.747
Okay, well, this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna get a job.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.750
You're gonna get an apartment.
And I'll help you.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.545
You can stay with us.
Right? She can stay with us?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.298
- Of course, yeah.
- Oh, that's so great.

04:59.465 --> 05:03.135
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you guys.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.512
Aw. I like cars.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.228
- You all finished here?
- Yes.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.980
Great.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.278
- Okay, here are the tips for this morning.
- Mm.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.449
Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes $8.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.328
- What?
- For all the free food you gave away.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.289
Well, if it's free food,
how come you're charging me for it?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.460
We don't give anything away
unless it's someone's birthday.

05:36.669 --> 05:40.297
Oh. What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.634
- No.
- Oh. Sorry.

05:47.722 --> 05:51.350
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.979
Jill, how did you pay for all this?
I thought your dad took your credit card.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.690
Oh, please,
I memorized those numbers when I was 15.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.111
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.281
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.577
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.

06:11.579 --> 06:16.500
I don't think charging clothes to your dad
qualifies as making it on your own.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.170
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.298
I don't think Rachel's gonna think
it's a good idea.

06:23.466 --> 06:27.636
- So who made her queen of the world?
- I would love that job.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.390
- Hey. What's going on?
- Hey.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.850
Jill.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.560
Did you shop?

06:36.354 --> 06:37.813
No.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.189
They did.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.443
- Yeah, we went shopping.
- Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.530
You went shopping?

06:46.697 --> 06:49.616
Then you came in here
and paraded it right under Jill's nose...

06:49.784 --> 06:51.284
...when you know she's trying to quit.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.787
Wow. You guys, that's terrible.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.372
- Sorry, Jill.
- Sorry, Jill.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.082
It's okay.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.919
- So, what did you get?
- Oh, well, all right. I got... Thank you.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.756
I got, um, this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.383
Oh.

07:07.385 --> 07:11.888
And then I got, uh...
These are apartment pants.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.850
Apartment pants?

07:16.227 --> 07:17.769
Yeah, you've never heard of them?

07:18.729 --> 07:20.772
No, of course.
Of course I've heard of them.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.942
- Ross, what did you get?
- Huh?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.404
I got this...

07:27.572 --> 07:29.281
This.

07:31.075 --> 07:34.244
- A pashmina?
- Yeah.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.457
Oh, I love these babies.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.545
- Really?
Mm-hm.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.088
Ross, what's a pashmina?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.425
It's a rug.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.511
Jill?

07:53.055 --> 07:55.098
I'm sorry, Rachel.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.059
Oh, come on,
you really think that's gonna work on me?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.187
I invented that.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.523
Oh, right. But I am sorry.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.360
All right, it's okay.
One little setback is okay.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.822
- But don't let it happen again, all right?
- Okay.

08:10.990 --> 08:15.327
Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff,
I should take it all away.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.788
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.668
And the pants.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.797
You know what? I'm just gonna take it all,
because that way, you'll learn the lesson.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.050
Alrighty.

08:30.218 --> 08:34.179
I'm gonna run a couple of errands,
and I will see you at dinner.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.226
She took all my stuff.

08:39.393 --> 08:43.270
Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.690
That's the best one.

08:45.858 --> 08:50.820
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
- Oh. Well, hey.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.741
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.409
Oh, yeah?
Well, how about you with the:

08:57.787 --> 09:00.580
- "I'm sorry."
- Shut up. I wasn't like that at all.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.792
What about what I said, you know,
about the apartment pants?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.544
How dumb was I?

09:08.839 --> 09:11.841
- Were you this cute in high school?
- Oh, stop.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.177
- No, you stop.
- No, you stop.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.387
You stop.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.890
Okay, why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it?

09:21.394 --> 09:25.897
Okay, so, what do you wanna do?
Let's do something crazy.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.192
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.653
Okay, I'll rest.

09:31.821 --> 09:36.366
But, you know, if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

09:38.077 --> 09:42.956
See, that would be impossible to resist
if you weren't all drippy here.

09:45.418 --> 09:49.713
Are you saying
that you don't wanna get with this?

09:54.218 --> 09:57.512
Yeah, I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.641
Oh. Come on.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.812
Don't take this personally, okay?

10:05.980 --> 10:09.024
It's just that I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.192
I'm with you, Chandler.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.362
I can't have sex with a sick person either.
That's disgusting.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.073
But I'm not sick. Let me prove it to you.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.622
We are two healthy people
in the prime of life.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.083
See, that's the thing.
I would like to stay in...

10:27.251 --> 10:29.502
...the prime of life.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.715
Hey.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.216
- Hey.
- What's up?

10:35.384 --> 10:38.595
Um, I think there's something
you should maybe know.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.805
It better not be
about the apartment pants...

10:40.973 --> 10:46.061
...because I just pitched the idea to
my boss at Ralph Lauren, and she loved it.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.855
No, no. It's just, I was, um...

10:49.023 --> 10:51.066
I was with Ross and Jill after you left...

10:51.233 --> 10:54.694
...and I'm pretty sure
I saw a little spark between them.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.822
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, it's probably nothing.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.368
But I just wanted to warn you
that there might be something there.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.536
- With Ross and Jill?
- Yeah.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.039
With Ross and my sister?

11:07.792 --> 11:08.833
Yeah.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.337
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.713
Yeah.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.591
- Oh, there is no way.
- Okay, then.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.678
Oh, my God. I cannot believe that.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.348
I don't really like it when Ross goes out
with anyone, but my sister?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.475
Isn't that like incest or something?

11:26.977 --> 11:32.023
Oh, my God, and they're gonna have sex.
Oh, no. What if he marries her too?

11:32.191 --> 11:34.818
Oh, this is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.320
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross, you know?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.615
And Jill, she should be able
to do whatever it is she wants to do.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.618
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
is marrying my little sister.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.828
This is just...

11:44.995 --> 11:49.290
Oh, my God, this is just the worst thing
that could've ever happened to me.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.836
But great news
about the apartment pants, huh?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.798
That'll be 3.85.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.884
What do you mean?
Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.847
It's just I can't,
because my manager said that I...

12:05.224 --> 12:08.476
Happy birthday to you

12:08.644 --> 12:10.937
Happy birthday to you

12:11.105 --> 12:14.149
- Happy birthday, dear Annie...
- Amy.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.484
Amy

12:16.652 --> 12:18.653
Happy birthday to you

12:18.821 --> 12:22.157
- Hey.
- Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.409
Yeah, not in here it isn't.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.497
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.583
Oh, hey. Uh...

12:31.751 --> 12:36.045
You know, I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.257
Oh. No. But I just walked past three sales
and I didn't go in.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.301
- How strong am I?
- Oh.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.678
That is great.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.264
Hey, you know
who doesn't have to job-hunt?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.976
- Ross. He works at the university.
- Yeah?

12:50.144 --> 12:54.105
Oh, so you know that? You guys talked?
So you get along? So you're gonna go out?

12:55.775 --> 13:00.111
Me go out with Ross? No. God, no.
What would make you think that?

13:00.279 --> 13:02.864
It's just Phoebe...

13:03.032 --> 13:06.493
...said she, you know, thought she saw
something between you guys.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.453
- No. I mean, he's nice.
- Yeah.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.040
He's the kind of guy you're friends with
but not the kind of guy you date.

13:12.208 --> 13:16.002
I mean, he's the kind of guy you date,
because you did, but me?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.129
Hmm, not so much.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.133
Oh, not so much? What do you mean?

13:22.301 --> 13:24.677
I mean,
is there something wrong with Ross?

13:24.845 --> 13:26.554
Oh, no, no, no. He's just...

13:26.722 --> 13:29.682
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.437
- Are you saying he's a geek?
- You think so too?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.732
No. No. Ross is not a geek.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.902
Fine. Then let's just say he's not my type.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.571
What, handsome is not your type?

13:43.739 --> 13:47.951
Smart, kind, good kisser?
What, those things aren't on your list?

13:48.118 --> 13:50.870
Ross is a great guy.
You would be lucky to be with him.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.998
Well, okay, if it means that much to you,
I'll ask him out.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.626
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I was just...

13:56.794 --> 14:01.256
You know what, Rachel? You're right.
You know, he has been really nice to me.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.883
Yeah, but he's not your type.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.052
But maybe that's a good thing.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.429
You know,
I'm doing all these different things.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.474
Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.437
Yeah, but you don't, you know...
You don't wanna try too much too fast.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.525
I mean, you do remember what happened
to the little girl...

14:20.693 --> 14:22.986
...who tried too much too fast,
don't you?

14:24.572 --> 14:26.155
What?

14:26.323 --> 14:28.741
She died, Jill.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.291
Chandler.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.379
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.966
Oh. Oh.

14:47.511 --> 14:52.056
Calling Dr. Big. Dr. Big to the bed.

14:52.808 --> 14:56.144
Oh, jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

14:56.312 --> 15:00.899
How could I be asleep
knowing that you were in the next room?

15:02.526 --> 15:03.776
I was asleep.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.576
Oh, no, no, no, honey.
You know what's sexy? Layers.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.536
Layers are sexy.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.415
And blankets are sexy.
And, oh, hot water bottles are sexy.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.251
Come on, get into bed.
I wanna prove that I'm not sick.

15:20.461 --> 15:23.755
I wanna make you feel as good as I feel.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.427
- Would you please get some rest?
- I'm fine.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.645
Happy birthday to you

15:41.315 --> 15:44.359
- You're paying for that.
- What? No, no, it's her birthday.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.278
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 different women today.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.989
- But it...
- You are no longer authorized...

15:50.157 --> 15:52.617
...to distribute birthday muffins.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.161
Damn it.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.206
Rach.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.083
- Hi.
- Hi. Ahem.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.502
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?

16:03.462 --> 16:06.798
- Well, yeah.
- Oh, wow. I mean, wow.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.426
I think she's cute...

16:10.594 --> 16:15.098
...but I never would've thought
of going out with her. Never.

16:15.683 --> 16:16.849
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.061
But after you said it was okay,
I figured, why not?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.356
Oh, so not really "never." Heh.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.443
I have to say,
you are a much bigger person than I am.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.196
I mean, after all we've been through.
I just...

16:30.406 --> 16:32.865
You know what?
I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.409
Aw.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.287
Hey, if you ever wanna go out with Monica,
you have my blessing.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.664
And mine.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.668
Chandler?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.254
I think I'm sick.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.589
Really?

16:48.757 --> 16:49.799
Struck down in the...

16:49.967 --> 16:51.592
...prime of life.

16:53.053 --> 16:57.098
Okay, fine, I admit it. I feel terrible.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.268
- Will you please rub this on my chest?
- Okay.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.521
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

17:05.232 --> 17:08.901
- Come on, I really need your help here.
- No, no, no.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.531
- Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
- Okay.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.554
So you're just kind of rubbing it
on yourself?

17:38.515 --> 17:41.517
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.480
Are you kidding me?
Is this turning you on?

17:45.647 --> 17:47.482
Yes.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.152
I can't believe it.
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.905
It's all very, very good.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.495
So you wanna go, uh...

18:01.789 --> 18:03.456
...mix it up?

18:05.125 --> 18:08.127
- Not now, I'm sick.
- Oh, come on, you big faker.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.673
What about your rule
about never sleeping with sick people?

18:12.841 --> 18:16.969
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.224
- Okay, if you really wanna have sex.
- Okay.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.020
Worked like a charm.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.776
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.194
What are you doing here?

18:33.403 --> 18:37.990
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

18:39.576 --> 18:40.827
I don't like it.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.289
- Really?
- It's kind of slutty.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.334
It's yours.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.964
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.258
Me too.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.388
- Hi, Jill.
- Hey.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.515
Hi...

19:03.016 --> 19:05.184
- Rachel.
- Rachel.

19:05.352 --> 19:09.689
Heh. You're not at home,
you're right here.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.440
Yeah, I know.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.820
And I bet you thought it would be weird.
But it's not.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.952
Okay.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.580
So, well, I'll, um...

19:25.747 --> 19:27.290
I'll have her home by midnight. Ha, ha.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.229
Why aren't you home yet?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.315
Is someone there?

19:53.066 --> 19:56.152
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.279
What are you doing here?

19:59.364 --> 20:04.035
Uh, I'm just looking out your window
at the view.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.704
What are you guys doing?

20:07.748 --> 20:11.000
We got some VapoRub in some places.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.840
Oh. He brought her back
to his apartment.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.551
Who?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.973
Is that your sister?

20:26.183 --> 20:30.186
Ugh. She is a slut.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.190
God. Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.984
Oh, my God, look,
he's taking off her clothes.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.528
He's taking off her coat.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.948
Oh, this is just terrible.

20:42.157 --> 20:47.203
Oh, no, it's not. It was the first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...

20:52.626 --> 20:56.087
Hoo-hoo. He's gonna get some.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.841
Of the glare...

21:01.343 --> 21:03.594
...from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.640
You know,
so, um, he's closed the drapes there...

21:07.808 --> 21:13.771
...so he can have a nice pleasant
conversation with your little sister.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.190
Well, I'm off to bed.
