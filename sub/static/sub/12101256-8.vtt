15:35.168 --> 15:37.603
[coughs]

15:37.637 --> 15:41.274
Oh, it smells like death.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.309
I'd say we found its den.

15:45.411 --> 15:48.080
Not exactly a picky eater.

15:48.114 --> 15:52.185
Yeah, well, I don't really wanna
fight anything that eats bears.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.954
You and me both.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.124
Hey, hey.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.259
Hello.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.994
Oh, hello.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.133
You got anything left in you?

16:07.166 --> 16:09.202
What is that thing?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.418
[engine turns over]

16:25.451 --> 16:26.719
Ah‐ha!

16:26.752 --> 16:28.621
Let there be light.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.290
That's incredible.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.593
Yeah, it's magic.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.568
What does it say?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.036
This way.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.071
Yeah?

16:55.281 --> 16:58.818
[low growling]

16:58.851 --> 16:59.752
Slow down.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.255
I'm the one with the flashlight,
remember?

17:02.288 --> 17:05.291
I can see... fine.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.531
Woah.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.382
What is that?

17:34.820 --> 17:37.557
Holy shit.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.592
It's a kid.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.478
Hey there.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.315
Jack: It's ok, we're not gonna
hurt you.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.016
Violet: What's she doing
down here?

18:04.050 --> 18:07.086
She probably thought this was
safer than outside.

18:07.119 --> 18:13.059
An abandoned mine with a giant
monster is safer than outside?

18:13.092 --> 18:16.295
Maybe she's lost.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.098
I mean, either way,
we gotta help her, right?

18:19.131 --> 18:20.132
Yeah.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.812
Come on, kid.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.016
Shit.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.286
Hey, it's ok.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.053
Jack!

18:41.087 --> 18:42.021
Hey!

18:42.054 --> 18:42.521
Jack!

18:42.555 --> 18:43.522
Hey!

18:43.556 --> 18:44.490
Jack!

18:44.523 --> 18:45.491
Hey!

18:47.126 --> 18:50.129
They should be just up here
around this bend.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.234
Do you regret falling in love?

18:55.267 --> 18:56.002
Excuse me?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.870
With Scarlett.
Do you regret it?

18:57.903 --> 19:00.106
I mean, would you take it back
knowing all the pain

19:00.139 --> 19:02.174
that it caused you
when she died?

19:02.208 --> 19:03.309
Why would you ask me that?

19:03.342 --> 19:03.976
Jeez!

19:04.010 --> 19:04.477
Woah, woah.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.178
Hey.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.180
Ivory: Thank you.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.149
Axel: Sure.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.185
Not like we didn't have enough
to worry about.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.256
You think we can jump it?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.325
Yeah.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.161
We could use that
to swing across.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.330
Ready to do some
Indiana Jones shit?

19:24.363 --> 19:25.364
Who?

19:32.371 --> 19:35.074
Ok, well I guess that
answers that.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.010
Catch?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.045
Yeah.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.051
Why can't it ever
just be easy?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.190
She made it look easy.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.492
Indiana Jones, right?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.194
Yeah, Indy.
Here we go.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.896
[grunts]

19:59.432 --> 20:00.399
Axel!

20:00.433 --> 20:05.938
[struggling grunts]

20:05.971 --> 20:06.972
No!

20:07.973 --> 20:08.741
No!

20:08.774 --> 20:10.910
Goddammit, I dropped
the compass.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.179
Swing to me.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.517
Son of a bitch.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.658
You got it.
You got it.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.995
[groans]

20:30.029 --> 20:31.530
No, no, no, no!

20:34.133 --> 20:36.302
Come up!
Come on!

20:36.335 --> 20:39.438
[grunts]

20:46.779 --> 20:52.118
[rumbling]

20:56.322 --> 21:00.392
[out of breath]

21:05.097 --> 21:07.566
That could have been worse.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.068
I guess.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.137
[laughs]

21:19.211 --> 21:20.179
Hey, kid.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.213
[screams]

21:31.624 --> 21:33.192
Where'd she go?

21:41.834 --> 21:42.768
Hey.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.137
Hey, little one.

21:45.171 --> 21:45.538
[growls]

21:45.571 --> 21:46.572
Woah!

21:47.506 --> 21:49.141
Ok, stop.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.342
Stop.

21:50.376 --> 21:53.078
We're not gonna hurt you.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.548
[growling]

22:06.158 --> 22:11.163
I guess... I guess she likes
shiny things.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.445
You ok?

22:43.229 --> 22:45.631
How long do you think
she's been down here for?

22:45.664 --> 22:50.369
Long enough to go full Lord
of the Flies.

22:52.771 --> 22:55.207
My name's Jack.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.109
What's your name?

23:07.119 --> 23:10.556
Is this your family?

23:23.102 --> 23:25.271
Are you hungry?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.176
Here.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.460
You can eat it.

23:48.494 --> 23:51.430
Trust me. It's good.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.465
Ugh, that's debatable.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.272
See? We're not so scary.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.287
Papa.

24:15.921 --> 24:16.889
Papa.

24:16.922 --> 24:19.124
This is your dad?

24:26.465 --> 24:32.571
Is this that...
thing out there?

24:53.258 --> 24:57.830
Jack, maybe we can give this kid
a chance at a normal life

24:57.863 --> 25:03.435
if we can find her dad
and turn him back.

25:03.469 --> 25:06.505
Before Axel and Ivory kill him.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.792
We can help you and your papa.

25:26.825 --> 25:30.262
Would you like that?

25:30.295 --> 25:34.033
Can you show us where he is?

25:34.066 --> 25:35.868
Come on.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.079
That... that's just my amulet.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.447
Woah! No!

25:48.480 --> 25:49.348
That little shit!

25:49.381 --> 25:51.250
Hurry, we gotta get her.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.157
Oh, that's fantastic.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.458
Now we're going in circles.

25:59.491 --> 26:03.495
Ok, well, we don't wanna
be here.

26:03.529 --> 26:06.065
You got that right, sister.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.967
It's an expression.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
We came from that one.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.073
Are you sure?

26:14.106 --> 26:16.208
No.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.510
We're just gonna have to
go through them one by one,

26:18.544 --> 26:21.080
mark them as we go,
trial and error.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.915
So just choose blindly

26:22.948 --> 26:26.251
until we just stumble upon
the correct path?

26:26.285 --> 26:29.188
That's pretty much it, yeah.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.089
Yeah.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.024
Wait a second.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.792
What is it?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.262
They're that way.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.198
How do you know?

26:41.100 --> 26:43.235
I don't know how I know,
I just know.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.370
Alright. Then we go that way.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.271
[coughs]

26:46.305 --> 26:47.606
Oh...

26:47.639 --> 26:50.109
What is that smell?

26:50.142 --> 26:53.078
That still smells like death.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.314
Everything smells like death
to you.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.350
[growling]

26:58.383 --> 27:01.186
I guess that is death.

27:01.220 --> 27:05.023
[snarling]

27:06.158 --> 27:07.159
Hey!

27:18.270 --> 27:21.840
Give us back the amulet.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.176
Please.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.179
We're trying to help you.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.353
Wiley little bugger.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.922
[distant screeching]

27:36.955 --> 27:38.457
What's that sound?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.261
We'll find out soon enough.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.930
Goddamn.

27:45.631 --> 27:47.599
[snarling]

27:47.633 --> 27:50.335
[groans]

27:50.369 --> 27:52.304
[growling]

27:52.337 --> 27:56.041
[fighting grunts]

28:00.546 --> 28:04.016
That didn't really go
as planned.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.053
[fighting grunts]

28:10.222 --> 28:12.391
[snarling and growling]

28:17.529 --> 28:25.404
[fighting grunts]

28:25.437 --> 28:28.040
Come on, come on, come on.

28:29.274 --> 28:34.279
[fighting grunts]

28:39.051 --> 28:41.320
[growling and snarling]

28:42.254 --> 28:43.255
Groovy.

28:44.690 --> 28:48.093
[growling and snarling]

28:52.097 --> 28:53.498
Take it's head, now!

28:53.532 --> 28:55.334
[gun shot]

29:00.772 --> 29:04.309
You... you shot me.

29:09.114 --> 29:10.282
We had that thing dead
to rights.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.250
You care to explain?

29:11.283 --> 29:12.284
We couldn't let you kill it.

29:12.317 --> 29:13.352
Why not?

29:13.385 --> 29:14.586
And who is this?

29:14.620 --> 29:17.623
That thing is her father.

29:17.656 --> 29:20.092
I would have never done it
if you didn't heal.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.093
I figured.

29:21.126 --> 29:24.162
This means that you like me?

29:24.196 --> 29:25.197
Are you ok?

29:25.230 --> 29:27.099
Yeah, yeah. It's ok.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.033
I'm ok, I'm ok.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.034
You want to turn it human again,
don't you?

29:29.067 --> 29:33.305
Well, that's the point
of all of this, isn't it?

29:33.338 --> 29:34.973
What is it?

29:35.007 --> 29:36.975
Not around young ears.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.446
Ok. I'm gonna leave you
with Jack.

29:43.715 --> 29:44.716
Hello.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.787
I'm Ivory.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.323
I'm sorry.

29:51.356 --> 29:54.359
I didn't mean to hurt
your father.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.267
Oh, look. I'm ok.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.702
I heal.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.138
Yeah.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.674
Don't let her run off.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.316
What's the problem?

30:17.349 --> 30:18.483
We let him bite one of us

30:18.517 --> 30:20.319
and that little girl
gets her dad back.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.420
I get it.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.588
It would be great to reunite
the kid with her father.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.091
But it might not be possible.

30:26.124 --> 30:27.492
Why?

30:27.526 --> 30:29.094
He's feral.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.662
Or damn near.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.664
Almost every time Vanessa tried
to turn a feral,

30:32.698 --> 30:34.499
the thing died.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.674
We have to try.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.310
What if it doesn't work?

30:45.344 --> 30:46.778
We're off to fight
the Dark One.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.814
We can't have a kid
tagging along.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.049
We deal with that when
we get to it.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.220
I... I guess we hunt.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.393
So what's the plan?

31:04.229 --> 31:08.100
We're gonna try
and save your papa.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.302
Just like we promised.

31:10.335 --> 31:14.206
I... help.

31:14.239 --> 31:15.240
Yeah.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.550
Thanks.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.420
Thanks.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.424
Papa.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.027
I guess it's go time.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.029
You sure he's got
no other way out?

32:11.062 --> 32:12.364
Sure as I can be.

32:12.397 --> 32:13.799
Ivory and I just about wound up

32:13.832 --> 32:15.300
at the centre of the earth
back there,

32:15.333 --> 32:18.970
so I think this is
the only way out.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.539
You wanna do this?

32:20.572 --> 32:21.907
Yeah, I got this.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.074
Ok.

32:23.108 --> 32:23.775
Alright.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.011
Time to ring the dinner bell.

32:26.578 --> 32:31.016
Take your positions, everyone,
in case things get... hairy.

32:31.049 --> 32:32.784
[small laugh]

32:36.021 --> 32:38.256
Alright, I'm coming with you.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.090
No.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.559
Wha?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.127
You kill.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.299
I'm not gonna hurt
your father, ok?

32:47.332 --> 32:49.334
We're gonna go help him.

32:49.367 --> 32:50.969
Ok?

32:51.002 --> 32:52.971
I promise.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.952
[winces]

33:13.058 --> 33:14.326
Oh, he's close.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.961
I can smell him.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.030
It's not subtle.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.565
Come and get it!

33:29.441 --> 33:31.209
[growling]

33:31.243 --> 33:32.577
Jack!

33:36.014 --> 33:38.950
[grunts and growls]

33:38.984 --> 33:41.052
[sniffs]

33:43.088 --> 33:46.525
[choking]

33:48.660 --> 33:49.861
[thud]

33:52.130 --> 33:57.035
[fighting grunts]

34:10.148 --> 34:11.516
Ivory!

34:12.217 --> 34:13.184
[screams]

34:13.218 --> 34:13.985
That's Ivory.

34:14.019 --> 34:15.487
Something's wrong.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.354
Go!

34:16.388 --> 34:18.089
[screaming]

34:18.123 --> 34:19.524
[groans]

34:19.558 --> 34:22.360
[screaming]

34:23.461 --> 34:27.933
[snarling and grunting]

34:35.040 --> 34:36.541
[roars]

34:39.711 --> 34:40.545
Get up, Jack!

34:40.579 --> 34:41.913
Get away form her!

34:41.947 --> 34:43.214
Jack, get up!

34:43.248 --> 34:44.549
Jack!

34:44.583 --> 34:46.017
Wake up! Wake up!

34:46.051 --> 34:47.652
Leave her alone!

34:47.686 --> 34:48.386
Get up, Jack!

34:48.420 --> 34:49.688
Get up! Get up!

34:49.721 --> 34:51.356
Get up!

34:51.389 --> 34:54.059
Jack! Get up!

34:54.092 --> 34:56.194
Jack!

34:56.227 --> 35:00.432
Jack! Jack!

35:00.465 --> 35:01.533
We're gonna have to take
him down.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.168
Yeah.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.036
I'm sorry.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.005
[gun shot]

35:08.273 --> 35:10.108
Papa, no!

35:12.410 --> 35:14.312
[growling and snarling]

35:14.346 --> 35:15.313
Papa.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.419
Papa.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.355
[growling and snarling]

35:24.623 --> 35:27.659
[struggling grunts]

35:36.334 --> 35:39.004
[coughing]

35:46.311 --> 35:49.147
[vomiting]

36:01.192 --> 36:05.163
[gasping]

36:14.439 --> 36:15.440
[struggles to talk]

36:26.184 --> 36:28.219
[sobbing]

37:49.300 --> 37:53.471
Sweet daylight.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.141
I don't care what kind of danger
we're facing out here.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.176
No more mines,
no more caves.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.345
Hell, I'll even veto basements
at this point.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.479
Agreed.

38:01.513 --> 38:04.115
[laughs]

38:04.149 --> 38:07.719
You sure you uh,
you wanna stay here?

38:07.752 --> 38:14.726
It's... it's safe.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.561
Together.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.363
Take it easy.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.331
You were nearly feral.

38:20.365 --> 38:22.534
It's gonna take some time.

38:24.402 --> 38:26.404
You be good for your dad.

38:26.437 --> 38:29.507
And you two look out
for each other.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.708
Thank you.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.212
You're welcome, Emmett.

38:36.614 --> 38:43.154
Well, I hate to be that guy, but
we got a lot of miles to cover.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.355
Good luck.

38:46.524 --> 38:47.525
Bye.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.708
You think we did the right thing
leaving them here,

39:03.741 --> 39:05.710
with him like that?

39:05.743 --> 39:08.413
It's too dangerous to take them.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.315
The kid's a survivor.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.250
And the old man ought
to be dead.

39:12.283 --> 39:16.354
Unless your Van Helsing 2.0
bite is somehow different.

39:16.387 --> 39:17.622
That's one tough
son of a bitch.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.691
They'll be fine.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.460
That was a really good thing
what you did for them.

39:22.493 --> 39:25.530
Yeah, well sometimes we need
a little bit of a reminder

39:25.563 --> 39:27.398
of what we're fighting for.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.434
I'm happy it worked out.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.371
We need a new vehicle.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.773
We need new weapons.

39:35.807 --> 39:40.111
What we need is to split up.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.613
We're stronger as a group.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.281
And we're more susceptible.

39:43.314 --> 39:44.816
That little adventure
just about cost the world

39:44.849 --> 39:47.719
its only shot at beating
the Dark One.

39:47.752 --> 39:50.121
I hate to say it, but splitting
the two of you up

39:50.154 --> 39:52.323
is the only way to make sure
that at least one of you

39:52.357 --> 39:54.392
makes it to the Oracle.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.431
He's right.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.466
Yeah.

40:14.812 --> 40:15.813
Here.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.189
Take the amulet.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.858
The Dark One and the Oracle

40:26.891 --> 40:29.627
don't know you've made it
back from the past.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.663
It's safer in your hands.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.668
I'll protect it with my life.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.837
Yeah, I won't let it
get to that.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.572
Alright then.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.344
We split up, take different
routes to D. C.

40:46.377 --> 40:47.879
You and I will take
the main road.

40:47.912 --> 40:48.980
They're gunning for us,

40:49.013 --> 40:52.583
so maybe we could take the heat
off of Jack and Ivory.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.352
Ok.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.554
But how are we gonna find
each other once we're there?

40:56.587 --> 40:58.556
There's a place called
Meridian Park.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.458
Has a sundial in it.

41:00.491 --> 41:02.760
Whoever gets there first,
hide a note.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.496
We'll meet up.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.665
Ok.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.300
See you there.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.235
You better.

41:14.539 --> 41:15.840
Hey, listen.

41:15.873 --> 41:20.211
All that crap I was saying in
the tunnels... forget all that.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.347
Love fast, love hard.

41:22.380 --> 41:25.450
That shit is rare.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.685
Better to have loved and lost,
you know?

41:30.621 --> 41:31.956
Come here.

41:33.891 --> 41:36.327
Take care of you.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.863
Yeah, you too.

41:44.702 --> 41:47.372
Take care of my sister.

41:47.405 --> 41:49.407
You know I will.

41:58.883 --> 42:02.954
Thank you, Axel,
for everything.

42:02.987 --> 42:06.491
You just make sure you get there
in one piece, alright?

42:06.524 --> 42:08.559
Let's get out of here.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.961
It's almost night time.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.696
We're sitting ducks.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.601
If you ever need me...

42:19.437 --> 42:21.939
Remember I'm always here.

42:24.809 --> 42:27.979
See you in D. C.

42:28.012 --> 42:30.248
Yeah, you will.
