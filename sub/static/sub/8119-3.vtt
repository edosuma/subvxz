00:00.000 --> 00:02.040
This programme contains adult humour

00:02.040 --> 00:04.080
and some strong language

00:11.120 --> 00:15.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:15.160 --> 00:18.120
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

00:18.120 --> 00:21.040
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.040 --> 00:23.720
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:28.320 --> 00:31.760
Hello!
Well, it's all baby fever today.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.440
What? Not you. Shut up!

00:33.440 --> 00:37.920
Dermot and Maria - they're going
for their first prenatal classes.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.440
Pre what? Nothing! Shut up!
Here! Do your jigsaw.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.120
It's a chicken.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.400
Where was I?
Oh, yes - prenatal classes!

00:52.400 --> 00:54.960
No prenatal classes in MY day.
You must be joking!

00:54.960 --> 00:58.960
If I asked the doctor,
was there anything
I needed to know before the birth?

00:58.960 --> 01:03.320
He'd tell me where to get the bus
to the maternity hospital.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.080
Good morning, Mammy! Good morning,
Cathy. How are you, love? Fine.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.160
I'm sorry the boyfriend turned out
to be married. It must be upsetting.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.920
Not at all, Mammy. I'm over that.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.480
Good. You have to expect that from
men. They're just lying bastards.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.760
It's no wonder there's
so much strife in the world -
it's run by men.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.800
How could anything good be done,
when it's a group of men
that sit in a conference,

01:26.800 --> 01:29.080
pretending to listen,
when all they're doing

01:29.080 --> 01:33.000
is trying to think
of what THEY will say next,
so they can sound clever.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.640
And even then it'll be a lie.
They'd make you sick, men -
and I mean sick!

01:36.640 --> 01:40.800
Vomit inducing, vermin, rat
bastards, every single one of them!

01:43.880 --> 01:46.120
Well, as long as you're over it.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.480
Oh, I AM over it, Mammy.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.080
I'm never having anything
to do with men again!

01:54.080 --> 01:55.680
How are you, Cathy?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.200
Bastards!

01:58.440 --> 02:01.600
Love YOU! ..What did I do on Cathy?
Same as you did

02:01.600 --> 02:03.720
on the rest of the world.
You were born.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.560
Hey, Grandad, what are you at?

02:07.560 --> 02:11.080
He's doing his jigsaw.
Ah, I'm great at jigsaws!

02:12.120 --> 02:14.400
Well, work away, son!

02:14.400 --> 02:16.120
It's a chicken!

02:16.120 --> 02:19.800
Morning, Mrs Brown. Ah, Maria. I
packed all your books into the bag,

02:19.800 --> 02:23.200
and I put one of Cathy's notebooks
in, in case you need to take notes.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.560
Thanks very much, Mrs Brown.
Gosh, I'm a bit nervous.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.760
Now, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.080
Not yet.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.240
Busy house this morning!
We're going to our prenatal classes!

02:35.240 --> 02:37.920
Ah, lovely! What language is that?

02:39.200 --> 02:43.560
No, Winnie, it's a class...
Maria, no, don't bother.
Just go, just go!

02:45.360 --> 02:49.640
Come on, Grandad, let's
get ready for your day trip.
The bus will be here any minute.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.360
You're going to have a lovely day -

02:51.360 --> 02:52.880
14 times around the block.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.000
Is Dermot gone? Yes.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.240
He said he wanted to talk to me!

02:57.240 --> 03:00.520
You were stuck into your jigsaw!
Dermo... Dermo!

03:06.320 --> 03:09.280
APPLAUSE

03:09.280 --> 03:11.920
Are they gone?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.600
You just missed them.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.000
Ah, I wanted to wish them luck
at their prenatal classes. Too late!

03:18.000 --> 03:21.760
They're so lucky. I'd love a baby!

03:24.560 --> 03:27.720
You wouldn't love a baby
if you had to feckin' have it!

03:28.880 --> 03:32.040
Ah, you soon forget the pain
once you see that baby.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.040
You speak for yourself, Winnie!
I'll never feckin' forget!

03:35.040 --> 03:37.520
Jesus, Dermot Brown
was 13 pounds 7 ounces!

03:37.520 --> 03:41.840
I still wake him up
during the night!
"You tore the arse out of me!"

03:46.520 --> 03:49.520
My Sharon was only five pounds!

03:49.520 --> 03:52.240
Well, you can't expect
to catch a shark with a worm!

03:54.560 --> 03:57.720
Jesus, Winnie,
you should have seen me on my first!

03:57.720 --> 04:00.800
I was lying there,
Redser was holding me hand.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.400
SHE GROANS AND YELLS

04:03.400 --> 04:06.200
I looked at him. "Ya baldy bastard!"

04:08.160 --> 04:11.240
And that was only the conception!
THEY LAUGH

04:15.400 --> 04:19.440
Agnes Brown, what would I do
without you to make me laugh?!

04:19.440 --> 04:20.600
Oh, you'd manage.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.880
You have a feckin' mirror,
haven't you?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.080
BABY CRIES

04:31.080 --> 04:34.200
Ssssh! Sssssssh!

04:34.200 --> 04:36.240
Sssssh!

04:36.240 --> 04:39.160
What the hell is going on?!

04:39.160 --> 04:41.520
I'm sorry, Mrs Brown,
did the baby wake you?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.680
Baby?!

04:43.680 --> 04:46.280
Have I been in a feckin' coma?!

04:47.600 --> 04:50.200
You were only seven months pregnant
this morning!

04:50.200 --> 04:52.640
What did they do
at the prenatal classes -

04:52.640 --> 04:54.800
use a feckin' plunger?!

04:56.600 --> 04:58.640
It's an experimental robot baby.

04:58.640 --> 05:03.680
Show me.
Oh, look! Hello! Coochy-coo!

05:03.680 --> 05:06.400
Mrs Brown, it's a robot.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.960
IN ROBOTIC VOICE:
Me-ni-me-ni-me-ni-me!

05:09.960 --> 05:12.320
Where did you get that?
At the prenatal classes.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.640
They were handing these practice
robot babies out to volunteers.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.520
It's to give you a feel of what it's
like to have a baby in the house.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.120
I could have told you that!
If they cry, you cuddle them.
If they're hungry, you feed them.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.840
If they shit themselves,
you wipe their arse.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.080
And that goes on for 30 years!

05:29.080 --> 05:31.040
LOUD BANGING

05:31.040 --> 05:33.160
GRANDAD: What's going on?!

05:33.160 --> 05:34.800
Make that 90 years.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.800
Nothing! Go back to sleep, Grandad!
I can't sleep with the noise
that dog's making.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.440
Then, put him out of the bed!

05:43.880 --> 05:47.280
It cried like this at my mother's
tonight. It just wouldn't stop.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.200
SHE couldn't even get it to stop!

05:49.200 --> 05:52.400
Well, give it to me, let me have
a look. See if I can help. Come on.

05:53.480 --> 05:56.280
Ssh! Now, now, now!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.440
Ssh, ssh, sssh! Come on! Ssh!

05:58.440 --> 06:00.560
BABY STOPS CRYING

06:00.560 --> 06:03.640
Mrs Brown, you have the touch!

06:03.640 --> 06:06.640
When you have a litter of your own,
you have to learn SOMETHING.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.840
Is that the basket?

06:08.840 --> 06:12.880
Yes. I'll put him down,
you go on to bed. But then,
I don't learn anything, do I?

06:12.880 --> 06:18.000
You learn what it's like
to have a granny in the house.
Go on, go get some sleep.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.400
Thank you.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.480
Now, come on.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.280
SHE LAUGHS QUIETLY

06:29.480 --> 06:31.840
So YOU'RE going to teach Maria,
are you?

06:33.640 --> 06:37.720
Will you teach her
that every baby is different?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.880
Will you teach her how important
it is to be a wife AND a mother,

06:40.880 --> 06:43.400
and not treat either one
as more important?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.360
I don't think so.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.200
I know some things.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.360
I'll tell you what I DON'T know.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.120
I don't know how I'm going to get
these fuckin' batteries
back into you!

07:02.200 --> 07:04.480
Make that two, Mr Foley.

07:04.480 --> 07:09.200
How are you? Sorry I missed you
yesterday. So, what's the story?
I need to find somewhere to live.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.480
It's getting close
to the baby coming,
and we can't stay in me ma's.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.320
Thanks, Mr Foley.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.560
I know where there's a place.
It's a bit small, only two bedrooms.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.440
That's all we need. And has
a little front garden. Lovely!

07:21.440 --> 07:24.040
And the rent's only 50 euros
a month. Brilliant!

07:24.040 --> 07:28.520
The only thing is, you'll have
Chinese people living each side
of you. I don't care. Where is it?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.960
Beijing!

07:30.960 --> 07:33.000
Shut up, Buster!

07:34.400 --> 07:36.560
She was the posh one in the family.
Yeah?

07:36.560 --> 07:40.320
Came to stay with us for a while.
I could hear her next door,
with her husband.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.640
"I'm arriving, I'm arriving!"

07:45.840 --> 07:51.040
You know what, Agnes? I could swear
I could hear a baby crying
in the middle of the night.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.680
Has someone on our street
got a new one?

07:53.680 --> 07:57.800
No, Dermot and Maria got a robot one
to practise on. A robot baby?! Mmm.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.800
Jesus! When I was pregnant, they
gave me a cabbage to practise on!

08:01.800 --> 08:05.240
And then you had Sharon -
the real thing!

08:07.920 --> 08:12.200
Agnes, what did your Redser say
when you told him you were pregnant
on your first?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.840
He said,
"We'd better get married, so!"

08:14.840 --> 08:17.080
That's nice!

08:17.080 --> 08:19.600
We were standing outside
Kapiniski's Jewellers.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.400
There was a sign in the window said,
"Come in and pick your ring."

08:25.600 --> 08:30.280
Where is it? I didn't get one. No? I
told him I wanted a bicycle instead!

08:30.280 --> 08:33.800
A bike?! Yeah. There was something
about a bicycle at the time

08:33.800 --> 08:35.440
that felt like freedom.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.000
Something about a ring
that felt like handcuffs.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.800
I don't know. I was worth it,
to get Mark. He's an angel!

08:42.800 --> 08:47.240
I remember when Sharon was born.
Jacko kept staring at her.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.480
Little red face...

08:49.480 --> 08:52.880
Full of wrinkles,
snots and dribbles everywhere.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.640
Aw! What about the baby?

08:57.160 --> 08:58.840
I KNEW you were going to say that!

08:58.840 --> 09:02.360
Winnie, everybody feckin' knew
I was going to say that!

09:05.240 --> 09:09.200
Mammy, this is Professor
Thomas Clowne, my course lecturer.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.960
How do you do, Mrs Brown?
I've heard so much about you!

09:11.960 --> 09:13.760
Winnie McGoogan - Jacko's wife!

09:13.760 --> 09:18.320
And Jacko is? Sick. Very sick.
Yeah, not well at all.
He's still in hospital.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.760
I'm sorry? Can we join you?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.960
If you're buying a drink.
Oh yes, of course.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.000
A pint of cider and a glass of...
Gin and tonic!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.200
It's free!

09:28.520 --> 09:30.520
A gin and tonic for Lady Muck!

09:30.520 --> 09:32.720
Ice and lemon as usual?

09:34.400 --> 09:39.000
So is THIS one married?
Mammy, it's not like that.
He's my lecturer, my mentor!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.320
Jacko had a mentor.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.120
Then he got rid of it
and got a Cortina.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.080
Does he take ALL his students out
for a drink after classes?

09:52.080 --> 09:54.160
No. I didn't think so.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.600
Mentor, my arse. He just wants
to try his bow on your fiddle.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.280
Mammy, it's not like that.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.880
Thanks, pet.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.520
So, how are we all then, eh?

10:06.520 --> 10:09.960
Agnes was just talkin'
about you havin' it off with Cathy.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.280
Sorry. I'll get some ice.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.400
Winnie is a bit drunk.
I'm sure you are wondering
what I'm doing here with Cathy.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.160
No. She's a big girl, it's her life.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.320
You know she's just been dumped -
you know that? Mammy!

10:24.320 --> 10:28.320
Actually, I asked Cathy
to bring me here to meet YOU.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.840
To meet me? For what?
Thomas is writing a book.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.560
Thomas?
What happened to "Professor"?

10:33.560 --> 10:36.600
I like my students
to let their hair down.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.280
I like my daughter
to keep her knickers up!

10:43.440 --> 10:45.840
Mammy, for God's sake!

10:45.840 --> 10:51.160
She doesn't mean that.
Well, I mean, she does -
I do like to keep them up.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.800
Oh, for God's sake!
I knew this was a bad idea!

10:54.880 --> 10:57.600
So, son, you're writing a book? Yes.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.520
He's writing a book. Well done, son.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.120
It's called
The Place of Woman in Modern Society.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.320
Sounds shite.

11:08.240 --> 11:12.120
Needs a better title - like Roots.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.520
Mammy, it's not that kind of book.
It's a look at how women have changed
over the years.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.400
Jeez, you're right there.
Look at the way Nellie Flanagan
is after changing!

11:20.400 --> 11:23.680
My God, when she was a young girl,
she'd boobies out to here!

11:23.680 --> 11:25.800
She's 69 now, they're down to here.

11:27.560 --> 11:31.600
She has to pull down her knickers
now to scratch her nipples!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.640
I warned you!

11:34.640 --> 11:40.000
No, Mrs Brown, it's about how women
have changed over generations
within society.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.080
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.360
Well, actually, Mrs Brown, I believe
you know more than you think.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.400
I'd love to study you.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.320
Would she have to strip?

11:51.640 --> 11:53.880
Sorry.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.000
No, son, that's not the kind
of thing I'm... Mammy?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.200
Can I sleep on it?
Is that all right?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.600
Fantastic. Please do.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.800
We were just talking about Maria -
getting close to the birth.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.040
Oh, she'll be glad
when it's all over!

12:08.040 --> 12:09.280
Yeah!

12:09.280 --> 12:12.320
You know, Dr Freud said
that pregnancy and giving birth

12:12.320 --> 12:14.920
are the two times
when a woman is truly content.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.720
Dr Freud should shite
a bowling ball and tell us how
fuckin' content he feels!

12:19.720 --> 12:23.400
Jacko loves bowling.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.680
Morning, Mrs Brown.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.080
Morning, Maria! How are you, love?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.760
I don't know how you do it,

12:35.760 --> 12:40.160
but that robot baby slept right
through the night again last night!

12:40.160 --> 12:43.120
You're amazing! It's still asleep!

12:43.120 --> 12:45.960
You giving it back today?
No - this evening.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.920
Dermot's off work today
so it's his turn to mind the baby.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.400
That'll be interesting!

12:50.400 --> 12:53.160
Well I'll be here all day,
so you needn't worry.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.920
Don't you go doing too much,
he has to learn, too!

12:55.920 --> 12:59.800
Oh, you must have heard the feckin'
kettle boiling!

12:59.800 --> 13:02.480
Well, as you're pouring.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.760
How are you, Maria?

13:03.760 --> 13:05.840
Morning, Mrs McGoogan. How's Sharon?

13:05.840 --> 13:09.240
She's grand. She's trying to lose
a few pounds for her holidays.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.000
Oh, God that's not easy for her
she has an over active er.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.040
Thyroid?
Knife and fork!

13:16.560 --> 13:19.560
I didn't hear your robot baby
last night Maria,

13:19.560 --> 13:21.320
bet you're getting the hang of it.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.480
Well, I can't take all the credit.
Mrs Brown has been wonderful!

13:24.480 --> 13:25.920
Oh!

13:27.240 --> 13:30.040
When you think of it Agnes I was
just as well they gave me

13:30.040 --> 13:31.480
a cabbage to practice on.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.160
I mean, what could you learn
from a robot baby?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.440
Lots of stuff.
Like how to feed it.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.960
Jesus! I wouldn't let anything
near my boobies that had batteries!!

13:44.040 --> 13:46.760
Well then.
how to treat minor ailments

13:46.760 --> 13:47.840
like nappy rash!

13:47.840 --> 13:50.800
Spit on a dock leaf
and put it on it.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.640
No, that's nettle sting.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.320
It is not.
It IS. It's nettle sting!

13:55.320 --> 13:57.520
Oh, I used it for nappy rash.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.440
Can't you just see Sharon
running around the playground with

14:01.440 --> 14:03.800
her arse like a Caesar salad!

14:06.600 --> 14:08.800
So what else do you use
dock leaves for?

14:08.800 --> 14:10.680
Telling the weather.
The weather?

14:10.680 --> 14:13.840
Tie them in a bunch, hang them
in your garden and every day

14:13.840 --> 14:17.600
go out and feel them.
If they're wet - it's raining.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.960
I'm going to try that.
I'm gonna do it right now.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.720
Good girl! If you can't
get dock leaves you get the same
result with lettuce.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.560
Lettuce...thanks, Agnes!

14:29.400 --> 14:31.200
Mrs Brown, you're terrible!

14:31.200 --> 14:33.160
Ah, it'll keep her feckin' busy!

14:34.280 --> 14:36.200
Right, then.
Oh, and before I forget -

14:36.200 --> 14:39.440
the IT man will be here this
afternoon to check on the robot baby.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.600
Will you make sure Dermot's
here for that?

14:41.600 --> 14:45.280
I will. And don't you be worrying!
I'd better get moving. see ya!

14:45.280 --> 14:46.560
See ya, love!

14:46.560 --> 14:50.480
See you later, love.
Are you sure you'll be all right?

14:50.480 --> 14:52.560
I'll be grand. Fine.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.120
It's still asleep.

14:55.120 --> 14:59.480
Amazing! I hope we're as lucky
with the real thing! I doubt it!

14:59.480 --> 15:01.920
You never know son, you might be!
Nah, Mammy.

15:01.920 --> 15:05.720
You won't be able to take
the batteries out of the real thing!

15:07.800 --> 15:10.200
Where are they?

15:10.200 --> 15:12.760
Here. Mammy,
you can't cheat at this.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.120
The IT fella's coming today and he
plugs the baby into a computer

15:16.120 --> 15:20.440
and the computer can
tell everything, if it was fed,
when it was changed.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.680
Jesus Christ!

15:21.680 --> 15:25.960
Don't worry, I'll just say
they slipped out when I was
changing it, or something.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.720
BABY WHIRS

15:30.240 --> 15:33.400
It's just re-booting -
it'll take a few minutes!

15:33.400 --> 15:37.200
Do you want a cup of tea?
Yeah. While we can!

15:39.400 --> 15:43.080
Grandad! Grandad!
There's tea down here!

15:44.160 --> 15:47.640
Must be strange having
a baby in the house again!

15:47.640 --> 15:49.640
No. It never leaves you.

15:49.640 --> 15:54.080
I still wake up some nights
thinking I can hear one of you's
crying. Did I cry a lot?

15:54.080 --> 15:56.200
I can't remember, son.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.720
You remember
different things about each of yous.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.520
I remember Mark was born
with a big head of curly black hair.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.080
And Rory, Rory was the easiest birth

16:05.080 --> 16:07.680
and Rory was so cute
so feckin' cute!

16:07.680 --> 16:11.040
And me was I curly? Was I cute?

16:11.040 --> 16:12.760
No, son.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.080
You were forceps,
by the time I got to you,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.120
your face was like
an aardvark's arse.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.120
And you weren't curly, you had
hair from head to toe!

16:23.120 --> 16:27.160
I think the nurses thought
I was after feckin' knitting you.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.040
But you had those eyes.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.600
Blue, blue eyes.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.080
Oh, full of mischief, but beautiful.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.880
BABY CRIES

16:37.880 --> 16:41.440
There's that baby.
It must be re-booting itself.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.320
It's usually louder than that.
I'll get it.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.280
Grandad! What are you feckin'
sitting' on?

16:51.360 --> 16:53.040
Am I pregnant?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.320
That leg is crooked.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.000
Don't worry about it,
he'll grow out of it.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.120
Mammy the IT man'll be here in ten
minutes, that glue won't set.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.560
You just go and get ready.
Leave this to me!

17:19.960 --> 17:22.400
Wait a minute! I've a feckin' idea!

17:25.760 --> 17:29.160
Thank you for the lift home, Thomas.
Pleasure!

17:29.160 --> 17:30.360
Smoked trout.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.560
It'll be dry in no time!

17:36.560 --> 17:38.800
Is she here?
I don't know, Thomas.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.160
You see, she said she'd sleep on it.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.760
Mammy! The professor is here.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.480
Oh, shit!

17:45.480 --> 17:46.960
Sit down, Thomas.

17:50.120 --> 17:54.400
Hello. What do you want? I was just
wondering, did you sleep on it?

17:54.400 --> 17:57.480
No, Grandad sat on it.
It was nothing to do with me!

17:57.480 --> 17:59.080
I swear I never touched it!

17:59.080 --> 18:01.200
What? What? What? What?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.000
Wait. What was your what for?
My what? Yes!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.920
Professor Clowne wants to know did
you make up your mind about his book?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.400
Wait, the what? What?
What was your what?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.840
I didn't what. You did.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.800
Your what was after my what
before you asked Cathy
what her what was for.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.320
What?
I haven't feckin' time for this!

18:16.320 --> 18:17.960
I've something in the oven.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.560
Sit down, Thomas.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.360
Thanks very much for calling,
do call again.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.760
Mammy! What? Thomas knows
you're busy.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.040
Sit down, Thomas. He just wants
to tell you what might be involved. 

18:38.040 --> 18:41.480
Fine. There'll be a question and
answer session.  That's nice.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.920
And then one or two tests.
That's nice. Mammy!

18:44.960 --> 18:46.280
That's nice!

18:47.920 --> 18:49.440
Hiya love!

18:49.440 --> 18:51.840
Maria, what are you doing here?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.000
I live here. Well, for now anyway!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.800
I know, but you're early!

18:55.800 --> 18:58.640
Yeah. When I told the ward nurse
what was happening today

18:58.640 --> 19:01.600
she let me go early! Will someone
tell me what is happening?

19:01.600 --> 19:04.480
I'm sorry. Maria, this
is my lecturer Professor Clowne!

19:04.480 --> 19:07.520
He's here to interview Mammy,
about motherhood, funny enough.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.320
Well you are talking to the right
woman, Professor.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.040
Mrs Brown is an amazing mother!

19:18.720 --> 19:21.520
I have never seen anyone
better with babies.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.600
Don't build her up too much.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.320
DOOR BELL RINGS

19:25.320 --> 19:27.160
Maria, get that!

19:28.880 --> 19:30.040
What's happening?

19:30.040 --> 19:32.800
Nearly there, nearly there!

19:34.280 --> 19:37.280
This is Mr Donnellan, the IT Man
from the pre-natal classes.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.400
Hello. Hello.
Where's the baby?

19:39.400 --> 19:41.000
In the kitchen with Mammy.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.440
Do you want to do it in the kitchen?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.480
Here's fine.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.760
Dermot, get the baby.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.400
Get the baby?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.440
Yes. The baby, get it!

19:54.440 --> 19:55.840
Mammy, they want the baby.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.280
Coming, coming!

19:58.280 --> 20:00.320
It's coming!

20:02.800 --> 20:06.400
Now, there we go!

20:11.400 --> 20:14.360
He has a bit of a temperature...

20:17.440 --> 20:20.720
..and a headache.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.000
Maria, I'm really, really sorry.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.360
Will you stop apologising,
Mrs Brown? It was an accident.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.000
You were trying to fix it,
that's all. Exactly.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.640
I know you wouldn't put a real
child in the oven.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.280
Not by accident.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.480
You're taking it very well.
Do you think so?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.600
Yes.
Just happy, I suppose.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.000
Good. Thanks for coming to the bingo
with me. I do love the company.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
Ah, I had a great time.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.080
Here, did you see that one
sitting in front of us?

21:01.080 --> 21:04.000
Ah, you couldn't miss her.
Big bushy red hair, buck teeth.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.720
Looks like she could eat an apple

21:05.720 --> 21:09.040
through a feckin' tennis racket.
What about her?

21:09.040 --> 21:12.640
She wins something EVERY Wednesday.
Every feckin' Wednesday! Does she?

21:12.640 --> 21:13.760
Mm!

21:13.760 --> 21:15.920
Winnie says she rides a motorbike.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.480
I don't think
that's all she's riding.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.840
You still a bit crampy, love?
Yeah.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.280
It wouldn't be labour,
would it, Mrs Brown?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.640
Labour? Jesus, no!
What are you now, 32 weeks?

21:28.640 --> 21:29.680
Yeah.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.520
No, baby might come early but not
eight weeks early.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.920
No, it's just wind. And when it
goes, you'll know about it.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.040
I let one go when I was pregnant.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.520
Me tights went up like
a feckin' balloon!

21:42.280 --> 21:44.960
I'm looking forward to having
a baby around the house.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.240
Babies.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.200
You what?

21:49.200 --> 21:52.200
I have to have a scan on Wednesday.
Another scan? For what?

21:52.200 --> 21:54.840
Dr Gibney thinks
that it might be twins.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.960
Feckin' twins?!

21:55.960 --> 21:57.560
Shh! Shh!

21:57.560 --> 21:59.040
Please, Mrs Brown!

21:59.040 --> 22:01.120
Zip, zip!

22:01.120 --> 22:04.040
I haven't told anyone yet
and I don't want to until I'm sure.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.240
You've told no-one?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.320
No. Except you.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.560
Well, in fairness, I think
we should tell Dermot.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.960
You're right, I will.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.200
I know so little about having
babies, or rearing them.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.520
We're all the same
on our first, love.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.320
You find out about having
them quick enough.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.080
And as for rearing' them,
I'm still feckin' learning.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.640
SHE LAUGHS

22:33.640 --> 22:35.040
What are you giggling at?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.680
I'm just thinking about
the innocence of it all.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.640
What are we like?
See me on my first?

22:39.640 --> 22:42.400
I went to the doctor
for me first visit.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.120
He told me to bring
a sample with me.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.360
I brought a feckin'
milk bottle full!

22:50.360 --> 22:53.600
I'm sure the poor man thought
there was a horse outside

22:53.600 --> 22:55.880
waiting to see him.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.160
He told me to take the sample
mid stream.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.600
If you'd seen me in the wellies

23:01.600 --> 23:04.680
in the middle of
that feckin' stream?!

23:04.680 --> 23:07.680
And all the fishermen
were just staring at me.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.840
I just went, "Don't mind me,
I'm pregnant!"

23:15.000 --> 23:16.280
Oh, my God!

23:16.280 --> 23:20.400
So the doctor finishes his
examination and I put me clothes on

23:20.400 --> 23:23.880
and he says "Now, Mrs Brown.
Have you any questions?"

23:23.880 --> 23:25.440
"Yes," I said. "I have."

23:25.440 --> 23:28.840
Says I, "What position will
I be in having this?"

23:28.840 --> 23:31.160
And he said,

23:31.160 --> 23:34.440
"The same position as you were
when you conceived it!"

23:34.440 --> 23:37.800
Oh, for two weeks I thought I was
going to have to stick me legs

23:37.800 --> 23:39.680
out the feckin' car window again!

23:46.880 --> 23:48.280
Beep, beep!

23:49.520 --> 23:51.080
Mind your horn, you!

23:51.080 --> 23:53.400
THEY GIGGLE

23:53.400 --> 23:56.280
Someone's having a good night.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.800
Just girl talk.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.600
That's all, just girl talk.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.240
MRS BROWN CHUCKLES

24:02.240 --> 24:05.200
We were just talking about
your father's driving test.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.360
He failed, he failed!

24:10.920 --> 24:14.120
Oh, don't feckin' start me off!

24:14.120 --> 24:16.440
SHE CACKLES

24:22.200 --> 24:24.440
SHE LAUGHS

24:27.080 --> 24:30.080
Oh, Jeez! I'm after wetting meself!

24:32.800 --> 24:33.840
Oh!

24:37.640 --> 24:39.600
Oh, God! Look!

24:39.600 --> 24:43.000
Stop it, stop it.
I think I'll make a drop of tea.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.600
Give you's a minute on your own.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.520
Hee-hee-hee!

24:50.360 --> 24:53.080
Dermot, Maria has something
she wants to tell you.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.120
A bit of news?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.040
As the hurricane said
to the palm tree,

24:57.040 --> 25:00.160
"Hang on to your nuts, baby.
This ain't no ordinary blow job!"

25:03.440 --> 25:05.800
And here, you.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.720
Son, you mind her.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.960
Why?

25:08.960 --> 25:10.800
Just feckin' mind her!

25:12.240 --> 25:14.960
I'll get you one of them
for Christmas!

25:14.960 --> 25:16.920
SHE GIGGLES

25:20.480 --> 25:24.120
Well, I have to have another scan.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.440
Not a problem.
I'll get some time off work.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.520
Let her feckin' finish!

25:28.520 --> 25:30.480
OK, sorry.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.360
It's just... Well, Dr Gibney
thinks it might be twins.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.800
Jesus! Twins!

25:35.800 --> 25:38.320
Two babies!

25:38.320 --> 25:39.600
Usually, yes(!)

25:41.400 --> 25:43.840
Twins!
Yeah, I know.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.000
Batman and Robin!

25:47.360 --> 25:50.000
We're not going to call them
that, are we?

25:51.760 --> 25:52.800
Of course not.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.120
Dermot, I love you.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.600
More pre-natal classes tomorrow.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.120
Yeah!

26:04.120 --> 26:06.800
Are you nervous?
Not really.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.680
Are you?

26:08.680 --> 26:09.920
A bit.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.520
It's all starting to become
a little bit real.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.400
Oh!

26:17.400 --> 26:20.080
I can feel a heel sticking out.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.040
That's a bingo pen.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.320
Oh. Must be a girl, so!

26:30.560 --> 26:31.680
Oh, and Dermot?

26:31.680 --> 26:34.920
I don't want anybody else to know,
OK? Not until I'm sure.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.400
OK, sure.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.200
CHEERING

26:40.200 --> 26:41.520
Mammy told us!

26:43.760 --> 26:45.320
How do you do that?

26:45.320 --> 26:47.760
SHE GIGGLES

26:47.760 --> 26:49.960
TOILET FLUSHING

26:49.960 --> 26:51.760
What's going on?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.960
Twins!

26:52.960 --> 26:54.880
Nah, but it felt like it.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.440
ALL: Twins!

27:03.880 --> 27:06.200
So there you have it.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.600
That's life with children.
Sometimes you wish you had more

27:09.600 --> 27:12.800
and sometimes you wish
you'd kept your knees together.

27:13.960 --> 27:18.360
You know, somebody said it takes
a village to rear a child.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.360
I don't know about that,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.400
but I do know it takes a family.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.880
GROANING

27:23.880 --> 27:26.640
Shut up, Grandad!
You're not pregnant!

27:27.880 --> 27:30.040
I mean, take Grandad for instance.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.840
I don't know how I would've coped
without him,

27:32.840 --> 27:35.440
in the early days when the children
were younger.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.760
Two, three times a week, he'd call
over and take them for a walk.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.840
And children
don't forget that, never.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.720
To this day, all my children love
a walk to the bookie shop.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.400
Come on, Grandad.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.840
Let's get you up to your bath
and your bed.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.520
Come on. Don't forget
to brush your teeth.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.160
They're in your pocket.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.200
SHE GIGGLES

28:02.800 --> 28:04.920
Good night!

28:34.120 --> 28:37.440
