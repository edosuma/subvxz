02:07.870 --> 02:09.231
C'mon, jump!

02:09.430 --> 02:10.231
Jump!

02:12.111 --> 02:12.991
And again!

04:29.028 --> 04:30.429
Dad, can I go and watch?

04:31.069 --> 04:31.789
Please, Dad!

04:31.989 --> 04:33.789
I'll park and be right there.

04:34.068 --> 04:35.708
- Don't wander off, will you?
- No.

07:26.105 --> 07:27.266
I'm in a strange business.

07:27.785 --> 07:31.186
Once you're in,
that's it, you can't get out.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.345
It's like damnation.
You're doomed to stick at it

07:34.945 --> 07:36.025
until you die.

07:36.305 --> 07:37.465
Spilled blood never dries.

07:37.664 --> 07:39.825
Spilled blood never dries, kid.
Got that?

07:40.664 --> 07:41.665
Never!

07:41.904 --> 07:43.985
You live in fear all your life.

07:44.185 --> 07:45.585
If you drop your guard,

07:46.224 --> 07:47.705
you're screwed.

07:49.745 --> 07:52.065
Prison's just a pause in the game.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.025
You got time for a minor offense.
Count yourself lucky.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.905
In a month, you can forget it

07:57.104 --> 07:58.545
and live your life free.

08:03.505 --> 08:05.105
Old Timer, let's go.

08:12.664 --> 08:13.585
Believe me, kid,

08:13.784 --> 08:16.625
nothing good comes
from running with a bad crowd.

08:20.305 --> 08:21.785
Glad to have met you, Charly.

09:09.103 --> 09:11.664
Elie Goldman,
killed in the line of duty.

09:18.863 --> 09:20.184
Bullet wounds,
support ventilation,

09:20.383 --> 09:22.424
cardiovascular functions intact.

09:25.222 --> 09:26.663
Slowing down.
Adrenalin!

09:38.502 --> 09:40.543
- When'd you get to him?
- Ten minutes ago.

09:40.982 --> 09:43.463
- Pulse, blood pressure?
- Pulse 70, BP 90.

09:43.663 --> 09:45.663
- What's he had?
- Adrenalin, sufenta.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.623
The mayor says to him,
"Don't lower the tone."

09:57.183 --> 10:00.103
So Philibert,
head of the legislature, remember,

10:00.543 --> 10:03.103
says, "How do you know
a she-ass is in heat?"

10:03.543 --> 10:05.143
The mayor replies snootily,

10:05.342 --> 10:09.423
"Your question proves you're incapable
of intelligent debate."

10:09.622 --> 10:10.783
But Philibert insists,

10:10.982 --> 10:13.263
"Don't tell me
you don't know, dammit!"

10:13.742 --> 10:16.103
And the mayor says,
"No, I don't know!"

10:16.502 --> 10:17.823
So Philibert says...

10:18.423 --> 10:19.543
You were smoking?

10:24.741 --> 10:26.342
You smoke in my house?

10:31.221 --> 10:32.462
Philibert says,

10:32.662 --> 10:36.102
"It just show you're dumber
than an ass. He know."

10:38.101 --> 10:38.982
Yes?

10:39.621 --> 10:42.222
I can't hear you.
I'll call you from my office.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.262
Yes...

10:47.902 --> 10:48.862
Is he dead?

10:51.741 --> 10:53.342
Keep me informed.

10:53.822 --> 10:56.102
Mr. Martinelli,
k-knock before you enter.

10:56.422 --> 10:59.262
It's important.
It's about your tax audit.

10:59.461 --> 11:01.622
I received a refusal from the IRS.

11:03.101 --> 11:04.742
I said,
knock before you enter!

11:05.782 --> 11:07.342
Isn't that c-clear enough?

11:08.182 --> 11:10.022
Your work's as bad as your manners.

11:10.221 --> 11:11.782
Get out and knock.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.742
If I say come in, you come in.

11:23.181 --> 11:24.741
Can I come in, Mr. Zacchia?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.061
Forceps.

11:38.261 --> 11:39.501
Spatula...

11:41.941 --> 11:46.021
Charly Mattei, 57, one of the last
mafia godfathers in Marseille,

11:46.220 --> 11:48.981
was rushed to Timone Hospital.

11:49.181 --> 11:51.501
According to doctors,
his status is critical.

11:51.700 --> 11:52.461
Get Goldman.

11:52.661 --> 11:55.781
He was shot several times
in unexplained circumstances.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.941
Three years ago,
Mattei sold his shares

11:58.141 --> 12:00.341
in various Riviera nightspots
and hotels

12:00.541 --> 12:02.261
to businessman Tony Zacchia

12:02.460 --> 12:04.101
and Aurelio Rampoli,
aka The Finisher

12:04.301 --> 12:06.861
another nightclub kingpin
in the region.

12:07.061 --> 12:09.021
Often suspected, never convicted,

12:09.220 --> 12:11.701
Charly Mattei had apparently retired

12:11.901 --> 12:14.581
to be with his two children
and wife, Christelle,

12:14.781 --> 12:15.821
but today's events...

12:16.021 --> 12:18.021
No, sir, they were professionals.

12:18.220 --> 12:21.141
We found both vehicles
burned out by the port.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.700
They'd been stolen.

12:24.099 --> 12:28.140
I know, but we can't do our job here.
It's chaos.

12:28.339 --> 12:31.020
An anonymous caller
tipped off journalists.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.420
When I say anonymous,
it means it wasn't me.

12:35.300 --> 12:36.300
No, sir.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.060
Do I enjoy working
surrounded by these vultures?

12:45.020 --> 12:48.540
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it
and keep you informed.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.400
What did I say exactly?

13:00.119 --> 13:00.960
Hurry up.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.120
I know what you said, Aurelio...

13:03.320 --> 13:05.400
Bertrand, what did I say exactly?

13:05.599 --> 13:08.280
What words did I use?
Words are important.

13:08.479 --> 13:09.840
You said, "Bertrand...

13:10.520 --> 13:12.320
- I'll trust you..."
- Like a friend.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.640
"Like a friend."

13:15.920 --> 13:17.120
An amico.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.640
"I'll trust you like a friend,
but I'm dumb,

13:19.838 --> 13:21.239
because you're a flake,

13:21.679 --> 13:22.879
like you're whole family."

13:23.078 --> 13:24.719
Right.
That's better, Bertrand.

13:24.919 --> 13:26.559
Then what did I say?

13:26.919 --> 13:27.759
Precisely.

13:28.439 --> 13:29.039
Then?

13:30.118 --> 13:31.479
You said if I took one gram...

13:31.679 --> 13:33.439
One single gram.

13:34.759 --> 13:37.119
- You'd teach me a lesson.
- See? You remember.

13:37.319 --> 13:38.199
Excuse me.

13:38.399 --> 13:40.319
I swear I didn't sell her shit.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.399
The bitch stole it from my jacket!

13:46.799 --> 13:48.399
Yes, I hear you better now.

13:56.639 --> 13:57.439
Guys...

13:57.639 --> 13:59.079
Mattei got shot in a garage.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.239
- Is he dead?
- Shot to fuck!

14:09.838 --> 14:10.399
Scissors.

14:12.279 --> 14:12.719
Forceps.

14:21.477 --> 14:24.998
Newsflash.
Martial Padovano, known as Old Timer

14:25.197 --> 14:27.198
was shot dead an hour ago in Lenche.

14:27.398 --> 14:29.518
Police believe
it was a revenge killing.

14:29.717 --> 14:32.638
Padovano was a major figure
in the local mafia.

14:32.837 --> 14:34.678
He was 85 years old.

14:45.477 --> 14:47.038
Have a good day,
Mr. Hernandez.

14:50.758 --> 14:52.318
Goodbye, Mr. Hernandez.

15:07.837 --> 15:08.398
You're crazy.

15:09.357 --> 15:11.478
Killing Hernandez is like
killing the Pope or President.

15:11.837 --> 15:14.438
I'd k-kill the P-President!

15:19.637 --> 15:20.957
Friends till after we die.

15:24.076 --> 15:25.077
Friends till after we die.

16:01.956 --> 16:03.757
Dad!

16:24.595 --> 16:25.996
You ever meet Mattei?

16:26.195 --> 16:28.996
I ran into him once
when I was with Vice ten years ago.

16:29.195 --> 16:31.316
Some trouble over his second wife.

16:31.516 --> 16:32.436
And his first?

16:33.115 --> 16:36.516
He met her very young.
They had a daughter, Eva.

16:36.756 --> 16:39.076
She got remarried
to his lawyer, Beaudinard.

16:39.676 --> 16:40.556
We know the second?

16:40.875 --> 16:44.156
A prostitute, Christelle Kolarov.
She worked for Pistachio.

16:44.355 --> 16:46.716
Mattei fell for her
took her off the streets

16:46.916 --> 16:49.236
got her off dope,
a one-man detox clinic.

16:49.436 --> 16:52.196
He got her pregnant
and Pistachio got very mad.

17:18.315 --> 17:20.194
The streets are filthy!
And the stink!

17:20.914 --> 17:22.515
It'd only happen in Marseille.

17:22.714 --> 17:25.795
Guys work ten hours a week
and they want a raise. Sit down.

17:26.114 --> 17:28.075
Only Louis XIV understood Marseille.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.715
You know what he did?
Knocked down the city walls

17:30.914 --> 17:34.115
and turned cannons from nearby forts
towards the city.

17:34.315 --> 17:36.475
I can tell you,
they got the message.

17:36.995 --> 17:38.555
You know Louis XIV's motto?

17:39.594 --> 17:40.955
No, sir.

17:41.154 --> 17:44.035
"Impatience for victory
guarantees defeat."

17:44.834 --> 17:45.755
You see, Goldman,

17:45.955 --> 17:48.235
I agree with Louis XIV
and the garbage men.

17:48.555 --> 17:52.075
There's no hurry to clean up.
They wanna kill each other?

17:52.275 --> 17:54.115
Fine.
That means less to arrest.

17:54.634 --> 17:56.235
Isn't our role to investigate?

17:56.434 --> 17:59.035
Our role
is to protect honest citizens.

17:59.555 --> 18:01.675
Not to keep order among thugs.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.715
Bury a hoodlum,
bury the case.

18:04.195 --> 18:04.835
Mattei's dead?

18:05.275 --> 18:07.355
Amazingly, no.
He's out of the coma.

18:07.555 --> 18:09.875
Question him.
If he identifies someone, fine.

18:10.073 --> 18:11.234
If not, forget it.

18:11.514 --> 18:13.634
I'd be surprised
if he opens up to you.

18:13.833 --> 18:14.834
Goldman!

18:15.474 --> 18:17.314
Don't make this personal.

18:18.673 --> 18:20.954
Your husband
was an exceptional officer,

18:21.153 --> 18:22.714
who took too many risks.

18:23.474 --> 18:25.954
Nothing's more absurd
than a medal on a coffin.

18:26.153 --> 18:29.114
It would be less absurd
if his killer was punished.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.634
Did you recognize your attackers?

18:40.153 --> 18:41.914
Had you received threats?

18:43.113 --> 18:43.714
Mr. Mattei...

18:44.153 --> 18:46.674
Our investigation's futile
if you don't help.

18:46.954 --> 18:48.554
They'll try to finish the job.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.754
An officer outside won't stop them,

18:50.954 --> 18:52.114
just delay them.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.154
So help me.

19:00.234 --> 19:01.154
No.

19:06.714 --> 19:07.474
Morning, counsel.

19:07.673 --> 19:09.714
Captain,
I'd like to be told of your visits.

19:09.912 --> 19:12.433
Just doing my job.
Now, you do yours.

19:12.632 --> 19:15.553
Tell your client
it's in his interest to help us.

19:16.352 --> 19:17.393
Gentlemen...

19:19.713 --> 19:20.953
Look who I brought.

19:27.713 --> 19:28.393
Mom?

19:30.912 --> 19:32.953
When you die, is it forever?

19:33.152 --> 19:34.953
Yes, it's forever.

19:35.392 --> 19:38.033
So Dad'll be buried
in the ground forever?

19:41.392 --> 19:42.473
'Course not.

19:52.953 --> 19:53.913
Your Daddy

19:54.473 --> 19:56.473
is in a beautiful place,

19:57.112 --> 20:00.193
where he's very happy
because he can see you grow up.

20:00.953 --> 20:02.593
- He's proud of you.
- He sees me?

20:02.872 --> 20:03.713
Of course.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.273
Through the curtains?

20:05.473 --> 20:07.433
Through the curtains.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.592
Why doesn't he ever call then?

20:11.232 --> 20:13.072
They don't have phones there.

20:13.272 --> 20:15.752
But it doesn't matter
because he can see you.

20:17.111 --> 20:18.832
He sees you and hears you.

20:19.911 --> 20:20.992
Sleep now, sweetie.

20:22.871 --> 20:23.792
I love you.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.352
Don't do anything till Charly's out.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.672
We're not gonna just wait
for them to come back.

21:03.911 --> 21:06.712
Who are "them"?
We don't know who did it.

21:06.910 --> 21:09.031
Sneaking around here,
we won't find out.

21:09.231 --> 21:12.031
What do you suggest?
Torching Marseille? Raising an army?

21:12.231 --> 21:14.231
There's three of us.
We're all he has.

21:20.751 --> 21:22.311
Make sure he's never alone.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.871
If you need me, no cell phones.

22:21.109 --> 22:23.030
He went that way.

22:43.829 --> 22:44.510
He's better.

22:44.710 --> 22:46.670
Better, but his singing's awful.

23:49.068 --> 23:52.349
Superbugs. Hospitals are full of them.
Watch out.

24:02.827 --> 24:05.388
I think I'll take a cigarette break.

24:08.988 --> 24:09.828
They looking after you?

24:11.468 --> 24:12.148
Good.

24:12.468 --> 24:15.668
If you need anything.
For Christelle, the kids, I'm here.

24:19.948 --> 24:23.468
They refused my flowers.
They prefer the hospital smell.

24:24.548 --> 24:25.988
Open up.
Open the door!

24:26.988 --> 24:28.908
Show him the flowers.

24:30.548 --> 24:31.188
Look...

24:33.948 --> 24:35.508
Shame, they're beautiful.

24:36.468 --> 24:37.828
Shut the door.

24:38.948 --> 24:41.908
You're looking good, real good.

24:42.268 --> 24:44.508
Martin said you're tired.
You look great.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.948
Twenty-two bullets
and you're in better shape than me.

24:47.827 --> 24:49.388
In two weeks, you'll be windsurfing.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.948
Look at me.
I'm sagging all over.

24:53.147 --> 24:55.668
Every morning, I get a shock.
I'm all gray.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.268
That's why I wear shades.

24:59.906 --> 25:01.947
I went to the church
and got you this.

25:02.866 --> 25:04.107
Saint Pancras.

25:04.906 --> 25:08.067
Patron saint of herds in Corsica
and the best healer.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.587
The priest said to kiss the back
when you're in pain.

25:14.787 --> 25:16.627
Microphones, cameras.
Cops in ambulance.

25:21.787 --> 25:24.747
You're my brother.
I swear I'll find who did this.

25:30.586 --> 25:31.267
Thanks.

25:40.947 --> 25:42.267
I'll leave the chocolates.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.387
Don't expect cooperation.
He refused an anesthetic.

25:51.586 --> 25:53.147
- What?
- His arm nerves were hit.

25:53.626 --> 25:56.987
It's simple to treat under anesthetic,
but he won't trust us.

25:57.186 --> 25:59.426
He's scared
they'll get him while he's out.

25:59.786 --> 26:02.546
That's not all.
Look at his lung X-ray.

26:04.065 --> 26:05.266
He swallowed a revolver?

26:05.466 --> 26:06.666
We couldn't move him.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.226
The X-ray was taken
from over his bed.

26:09.825 --> 26:11.506
The gun was under the mattress.

27:03.064 --> 27:05.665
He left you and the kid
and you still love him.

27:07.225 --> 27:09.705
I don't blame you.
Everyone loves him, even me.

27:10.144 --> 27:11.025
He's improving.

27:11.225 --> 27:13.905
Before people called him Psycho,
now it's the Immortal.

27:14.104 --> 27:15.425
That's much better, isn't it?

27:16.705 --> 27:18.665
I'd hate to be immortal without you.

27:23.705 --> 27:25.185
He sends his love.

27:29.864 --> 27:31.665
How can you get any rest?

27:32.305 --> 27:34.025
Leave it.
It's not easy for her.

27:54.984 --> 27:57.104
Eva, can you turn it down, please?

28:06.143 --> 28:07.304
Why do you do that?

28:08.143 --> 28:09.944
Your mother needs to rest.

28:11.304 --> 28:12.584
Eva, I'm talking to you.

28:14.103 --> 28:16.064
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

28:20.304 --> 28:21.424
Don't cry, beautiful.

28:22.063 --> 28:23.064
Don't cry.

28:37.504 --> 28:39.704
My mom's dying
and my dad's a vegetable.

28:39.903 --> 28:41.744
There's not much to smile about.

28:42.784 --> 28:44.904
He promised me he was through.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.904
He swore.

28:47.143 --> 28:48.784
He swore it to mom.

28:51.303 --> 28:52.543
He know she's sick.

28:52.743 --> 28:55.103
He doesn't give a damn
about her or me.

28:55.303 --> 28:56.863
He's a liar, a bastard.

28:57.342 --> 28:59.863
He wasn't lying.
He quit, believe me.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.823
So why'd he get shot?

29:02.503 --> 29:03.143
I don't know.

29:14.303 --> 29:15.703
I can't feel anything.

29:15.902 --> 29:18.743
Heat, pain, my son's hair
when I stroke his head.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.023
Let me...

29:21.062 --> 29:22.303
I want the truth.

29:23.983 --> 29:27.063
Damage to your radial nerve
forced me to suture it.

29:27.342 --> 29:28.623
Your fingers will never work.

29:31.023 --> 29:31.743
You'll recover

29:31.943 --> 29:33.583
a pincer function with your thumb,

29:33.783 --> 29:36.703
but you'll have to learn
to use the left. I'm sorry.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.863
I'll get something for that.

29:45.622 --> 29:48.703
God heard my prayers.
He saved you

29:48.902 --> 29:51.263
but he wants you to change,
make a fresh start.

29:51.462 --> 29:52.462
I have changed.

29:52.982 --> 29:55.502
All my life,
I lived with the idea that one day

29:55.702 --> 29:57.022
someone would tell me,

29:57.462 --> 29:59.262
"Your son, Mrs. Mattei..."

30:01.542 --> 30:02.822
"Your son..."

30:10.462 --> 30:12.542
Promise me I'll be first to go.

30:14.222 --> 30:15.342
We still have time.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.182
We checked your mystery calls.

30:25.861 --> 30:27.782
A stolen phone, but we traced it.

30:27.982 --> 30:29.742
- Where?
- Marseille's most popular monument.

30:40.542 --> 30:42.502
It's good of you to drop by.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.022
Eaten up by remorse?

30:44.222 --> 30:44.982
What remorse?

30:45.341 --> 30:46.822
- Jailing an innocent man.
- Sure.

30:47.022 --> 30:49.022
The girl cut her throat shaving.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.301
Know why I'm called Pistachio?

30:51.620 --> 30:52.821
The size of your brain?

30:54.981 --> 30:56.461
The pistachio is a tree

30:57.140 --> 30:58.301
that has a sex.

30:58.501 --> 31:00.141
There's male and female.

31:00.340 --> 31:02.301
To get pistachio nuts,
you need both.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.781
But the male pistachio tree
is so virile

31:06.181 --> 31:08.701
that one male
satisfies a dozen females.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.461
Just one, captain.

31:12.301 --> 31:13.821
She hated the competition.

31:16.860 --> 31:18.901
Are you my mystery midnight caller?

31:19.100 --> 31:20.501
What are you talking about?

31:21.060 --> 31:22.661
No phones in jail, remember.

31:22.860 --> 31:25.661
We're searching your cell.
We better not find anything.

31:26.181 --> 31:27.101
Bullshit.

31:28.461 --> 31:29.301
You wanted to see me.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.501
- You missed me.
- And you miss Mattei?

31:32.820 --> 31:35.741
You wanna pin that on me?
Am I the only guy you know?

31:35.981 --> 31:37.541
A month ago, I was here.

31:37.741 --> 31:39.261
You never did your own hits.

31:39.541 --> 31:41.581
If it'd been me,
I'd have pulped him.

31:41.820 --> 31:42.461
Who then?

31:42.660 --> 31:45.341
You're mixing me up with Zacchia.
I'm no snitch.

31:45.541 --> 31:48.741
Think again, Boudjemar,
I could improve your stay.

31:51.139 --> 31:54.020
Or maybe the guys
enjoy having a male pistachio.

31:54.220 --> 31:54.860
Bitch!

31:56.500 --> 31:59.500
For Mattei, until proven otherwise,
you're top of my list.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.260
Got that?

32:01.339 --> 32:02.580
Last night at the Best-Of,

32:02.780 --> 32:05.620
a guy from Castellane boasted
about shooting Charly.

32:41.619 --> 32:42.660
He's coming out.

32:52.699 --> 32:53.579
We're being followed.

33:09.898 --> 33:11.139
- They spotted us.
- Don't care.

33:40.578 --> 33:42.259
Nordine...Now!

33:47.938 --> 33:48.818
Back up!

33:49.018 --> 33:49.698
I'm sorry.

33:51.458 --> 33:52.858
- Back up!
- Stay cool.

33:53.057 --> 33:53.738
It's no big deal.

34:02.018 --> 34:03.458
- Shit!
- Chill out.

34:43.137 --> 34:45.456
I gave him GHB.
He'll sell his mom and dad!

34:45.657 --> 34:47.177
It'll last a good hour.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.496
Not that, please!

34:55.896 --> 34:59.337
I didn't do anything.
All I said was just bullshit.

34:59.536 --> 35:01.577
I'm begging you...

35:07.137 --> 35:09.417
Calm down. Deep breaths.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.737
That's right, very good.
What's your name?

35:13.057 --> 35:14.017
Frédéric.

35:14.217 --> 35:17.017
No one will hurt you
if you tell the truth.

35:17.217 --> 35:19.497
Got that? No one.
I give you my word.

35:21.376 --> 35:23.017
That's right, very good.

35:23.896 --> 35:24.777
You're a good boy.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.457
Now, tell me everything
from the start.

35:37.936 --> 35:41.817
I worked in one of his bars,
filling in for Gipsy.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.336
One night,
he said the Godmother wanted...

35:44.535 --> 35:47.296
We call Zacchia the Godmother, 
but not to his face.

35:47.495 --> 35:49.296
He wanted a cell phone carrier,

35:49.495 --> 35:51.696
so he didn't get cancer of the ear.

35:55.176 --> 35:56.776
Tell me about February 1st.

35:56.975 --> 35:58.896
I was at Le Becou
when they left.

35:59.696 --> 36:00.736
I saw them get ready,

36:02.975 --> 36:04.536
but I couldn't go, I swear.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.736
I just had a hemorrhoid operation.

36:07.935 --> 36:09.376
A real pain in the ass!

36:09.576 --> 36:10.776
I checked.

36:11.375 --> 36:12.256
Was Zac there?

36:12.656 --> 36:15.056
He left first.
An hour before the others.

36:15.696 --> 36:18.376
He had something to do
in town with Telaa.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.856
Fontarosa was driving.

36:21.736 --> 36:24.296
The guns were in the other car,
driven by Rabou.

36:26.056 --> 36:28.616
Paolini was riding shotgun as usual.

36:29.216 --> 36:30.656
He supplied the hardware.

36:32.415 --> 36:34.216
Papalardo had got the cars.

36:34.415 --> 36:37.096
A Mercedes for the boss,
an SUV for the others.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.336
Papalardo takes up a lot of room.

36:39.534 --> 36:41.975
He has Velcro shoes
'cos he can't reach his laces.

36:44.854 --> 36:48.175
Young Morvelous
was supposed to give the signal.

36:48.735 --> 36:50.695
It was the Magnificent Seven.

36:52.175 --> 36:53.575
Why'd he try to kill me?

36:53.775 --> 36:56.015
- Over drugs.
- What drugs?

36:58.454 --> 36:59.215
What drugs?

36:59.494 --> 37:02.415
Don't get mad, Mr. Mattei.
You won't like this.

37:02.615 --> 37:04.535
Everybody in Marseille knew it.

37:04.735 --> 37:08.495
When you sold up to Zacchia,
the condition was no drugs.

37:08.695 --> 37:09.375
So?

37:09.575 --> 37:11.015
For him,
drugs are the future.

37:11.494 --> 37:13.095
He's teamed up
with Pistachio.

37:13.295 --> 37:14.775
You were the only danger.

37:14.974 --> 37:15.655
Me?

37:15.894 --> 37:18.815
He was scared.
He's scared of your reaction.

37:19.014 --> 37:20.615
You scare a lot of people.

37:20.814 --> 37:22.415
Me, for example. I'm scared...

37:22.655 --> 37:23.975
You shouldn't be, Frédéric.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.255
You should.

37:25.735 --> 37:27.975
Zacchia wanted to strike first.

37:28.534 --> 37:30.815
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

37:47.294 --> 37:48.574
What do we do with him?

37:48.933 --> 37:51.174
Nothing.
We do nothing.

37:51.373 --> 37:52.254
What?

37:52.734 --> 37:55.334
He'll rat on us
like he ratted on Zacchia.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.894
He's a professional snitch.
We gotta silence him.

38:00.013 --> 38:00.774
No.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.294
I made a promise.

38:08.973 --> 38:11.214
We can't do this,
you know that. No way!

38:12.533 --> 38:15.934
Not you. Not Charly Mattei.
It's a question of honor.

38:16.813 --> 38:20.094
What good's honor when you're dead?
I did that for forty years.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.694
We can avenge you.

38:23.254 --> 38:25.054
If we kill him, it'll be war.

38:25.254 --> 38:27.454
Charly, wake up.
It's already war!

38:27.774 --> 38:29.134
You think
Zacchia'll stop now?

38:29.333 --> 38:31.334
You know him better than anyone.

38:32.214 --> 38:33.894
"Friends till after we die."

38:34.613 --> 38:37.333
He was a brother to me.
I'm his son's godfather.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.373
I'd have given my life for him.

38:46.412 --> 38:48.293
Dress him and take him home.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.900
Not a single Brit at Arsenal
and no Italians at Inter.

39:47.099 --> 39:48.380
What about Materazzi?

39:51.500 --> 39:53.380
One. One out of eleven.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.340
Thanks, Mom. I'm full.

39:55.540 --> 39:57.020
Look how thin you are.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.900
And with all the sport you do.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.940
I got a ten in dictation.
No mistakes.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.020
Good girl!
You'll go to college.

40:05.219 --> 40:07.740
- You cheated.
- No, I'm good at dictations.

40:07.940 --> 40:09.740
What's with you?
You're jealous.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.420
I'm proud of you.

40:11.739 --> 40:13.500
We're not used to tens.

40:13.699 --> 40:16.060
We always got called in
to see the teacher.

40:16.339 --> 40:18.300
Karim kept breaking the rules

40:18.940 --> 40:20.460
and Nordine slept in class.

40:23.779 --> 40:25.420
Because he partied all night.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.980
- She's right.
- We had it rough.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.500
- We had it rough, didn't we?
- Absolutely.

40:32.698 --> 40:34.699
Morning and night.
Me and your mother,

40:35.019 --> 40:37.139
it was rough.
Look how smart the girls are.

40:37.338 --> 40:40.099
It's lucky we're here,
because otherwise...

40:40.298 --> 40:42.259
But you're my children,
I can't complain.

40:44.138 --> 40:45.539
He gives me a kiss.

40:46.218 --> 40:47.619
See that?
Fine psychology!

41:46.578 --> 41:47.778
Franck, stop it!

41:48.297 --> 41:49.578
Franck!

41:50.657 --> 41:52.898
Back off,
we can't hear ourselves think.

41:53.097 --> 41:54.538
Your glasses are steamed up.

41:55.538 --> 41:57.098
He's got a good right foot, huh?

41:58.097 --> 41:59.138
Time to meet someone.

42:00.737 --> 42:01.378
You whore!

42:01.858 --> 42:02.738
Is that him?

42:03.777 --> 42:04.778
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

42:05.538 --> 42:07.418
- Want a word with him?
- It's okay.

42:07.737 --> 42:11.178
Go on, enjoy it.
One last word. A quick penalty.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.058
You could play for Marseille.

42:18.418 --> 42:19.978
- Last one?
- No, I'm done.

42:23.097 --> 42:25.218
Marseille's lost a good player.

42:28.977 --> 42:30.537
What's up, Bastien?
Not having fun?

42:30.816 --> 42:31.977
Sure, of course I am.

42:32.176 --> 42:34.177
Leave your watch alone.
Got a date?

42:34.377 --> 42:34.977
No.

42:35.696 --> 42:38.337
Stop checking you're fucking watch.

42:38.616 --> 42:39.897
You always do that.

42:40.417 --> 42:42.257
Screw the time.
Hand it over.

42:42.577 --> 42:44.497
- Pascal.
- Hand it over.

42:51.776 --> 42:52.737
It is a great watch.

42:53.417 --> 42:54.737
Hats off to the Swiss!

43:01.136 --> 43:02.577
Now you can look at it.

43:03.457 --> 43:04.497
Where were we?

43:06.497 --> 43:08.417
My boss has a message for your boss.

43:08.656 --> 43:10.857
If he wants revenge,
he's in trouble.

43:11.057 --> 43:12.417
He's not wanted in Marseille.

43:12.857 --> 43:13.817
Get rid of him.

43:16.377 --> 43:19.137
Franck, go get your dogs.
There's a feast coming.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.256
Morning, Mrs. Mattei.

43:47.135 --> 43:48.936
- A parcel for you.
- Thanks.

43:50.976 --> 43:51.816
Thank you.

43:52.655 --> 43:54.016
Have a nice day.

45:37.093 --> 45:39.214
To those who'll give us
no more shit!

46:41.053 --> 46:43.133
Take care of them.
Marseille's too dangerous.

46:43.332 --> 46:46.453
Another town, somewhere safe.
Whatever it costs.

46:46.933 --> 46:47.653
Leave it to me.

46:51.612 --> 46:52.973
The gifts!

46:57.893 --> 46:59.293
What is it?

47:04.172 --> 47:04.773
Thanks.

47:11.692 --> 47:12.493
Thanks, Pascal.

47:14.692 --> 47:16.093
You're smoking?

47:17.053 --> 47:18.413
You s-smoke in m-my house?

47:21.291 --> 47:24.532
P-poisoning my children
with your n-nicotine?

47:26.611 --> 47:28.812
Ever heard of p-passive s-smoking?

47:30.211 --> 47:31.332
He mimics him well.

47:31.651 --> 47:33.332
- You wanna kill them?
- Stop, Pascal.

47:33.691 --> 47:34.452
What?

47:34.771 --> 47:36.932
Is this how you thank me
for raising you

47:37.131 --> 47:38.492
out of the s-slums?

47:38.691 --> 47:39.772
I'm gonna kill you!

47:39.972 --> 47:42.252
Go ahead, Zac, smoke him!

47:42.452 --> 47:44.132
Yeah, I think I'll do that.

47:54.291 --> 47:55.692
Scared your fat ass, huh?

47:56.492 --> 47:58.052
Ange, it was a joke!

48:07.651 --> 48:09.972
Anyone plays the fool,
we all go boom.

48:10.171 --> 48:11.612
In the bucket, all of them.

48:15.012 --> 48:16.012
Nice and easy.

48:17.131 --> 48:19.212
Franck. In the bucket, I said!

48:23.290 --> 48:24.411
Take it in turns.

48:26.851 --> 48:29.131
Very good, Malek. Easy does it.

48:29.971 --> 48:30.971
Your turn, Ange.

48:38.571 --> 48:39.651
In the aquarium.

48:53.011 --> 48:54.291
Now, leave us alone.

48:57.011 --> 48:58.691
Bastien, look at me.

49:01.290 --> 49:02.491
You know who I am?

49:04.051 --> 49:05.131
What's my name?

49:05.610 --> 49:06.571
Charly Mattei.

49:06.770 --> 49:09.051
Charly Mattei,
and I'm here to kill you.

49:09.250 --> 49:11.771
Out in the open.
It's a matter of respect.

49:11.971 --> 49:15.451
I want you to know who kills you,
why you die.

49:15.649 --> 49:17.370
You know why you're gonna die?

49:18.570 --> 49:19.330
Yes.

49:19.890 --> 49:21.410
You don't settle scores in a hood.

49:21.609 --> 49:25.490
You wear a hood, you don't sign
the message. It's murder.

49:25.689 --> 49:26.850
You get the difference?

49:29.850 --> 49:30.890
Everybody get it?

49:31.649 --> 49:33.730
I'm gonna kill you all.
All of you.

49:34.970 --> 49:37.050
One after the other
but not right now.

49:37.890 --> 49:40.730
I want you to think
about what you did...

49:41.209 --> 49:43.170
Think about it day and night,

49:43.370 --> 49:45.930
beg your wives and children
for forgiveness,

49:46.129 --> 49:48.490
tell them why you're gonna die.

49:48.689 --> 49:50.650
And when you're least expecting it,

49:52.410 --> 49:53.890
tomorrow, in six months,

49:55.490 --> 49:57.530
or a year, I'll be there.

49:58.530 --> 50:01.210
You'll never be safe
as long as I'm alive.

50:03.209 --> 50:05.090
And tell Zac his turn will come.

50:05.289 --> 50:07.250
You'll have to kill me to stop me.

50:07.769 --> 50:08.330
Bastien...

50:08.930 --> 50:10.130
Charly, please!

50:12.930 --> 50:14.770
Look at your watch one last time.

50:17.489 --> 50:18.889
Happy birthday, Bastien.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.561
Let me out!

50:34.761 --> 50:35.601
Eva, stop it.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.001
Get out of the way!

50:37.201 --> 50:38.601
I wanna go home!

50:38.800 --> 50:40.601
- Eva, listen to me.
- Don't touch me!

50:47.400 --> 50:48.401
You listen to me!

50:48.601 --> 50:50.641
Six months I've listened!
Why are we in Avignon?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.721
Your father wants us somewhere safe.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.361
And nobody protests.
I don't care what he wants.

50:55.561 --> 50:57.921
I'm sick of all of you!
I'm going home!

50:58.121 --> 51:00.921
- I know...
- You know what? You understand me?

51:01.121 --> 51:03.521
You always understand.
You're so smart!

51:03.721 --> 51:04.521
That's not fair.

51:04.721 --> 51:06.361
My mother's dying. I'm off!

51:08.241 --> 51:10.361
What are you gonna do? Tie me up?

51:10.561 --> 51:14.281
I've done worse, but it's nothing
compared to what they'd do to you.

51:14.560 --> 51:16.320
Remember what they did to your dad.

51:20.439 --> 51:21.560
My little girl.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.800
It's hard enough as it is.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.000
Come on, calm down.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.200
Come here.

51:28.680 --> 51:29.920
My little baby.

51:46.760 --> 51:49.720
Sorry, son, I went to Roumagnac's
for the flowers.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.800
They have great roses,
but they're always packed.

51:53.399 --> 51:54.400
Remember

51:54.999 --> 51:56.680
we went there together once.

51:56.879 --> 51:59.920
You were in love with that girl.
What was her name?

52:00.120 --> 52:01.920
He answers when you talk to him?

52:06.160 --> 52:07.720
I stopped coming.
No one ever answers.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.720
I've lost it since my son died.

52:09.919 --> 52:12.000
Like me, since Karim died.

52:12.918 --> 52:16.479
Sorry for what happened.
It wasn't my idea, I just obeyed.

52:19.838 --> 52:20.839
I'm unarmed.

52:21.039 --> 52:23.759
I never made a habit
of shooting unarmed men.

52:24.279 --> 52:26.119
It's just
that I've changed my habits.

52:46.239 --> 52:47.479
Talk very softly.

52:47.679 --> 52:51.559
Mr. Zacchia has migraine aura.
You know, a visual migraine.

52:54.239 --> 52:56.799
He has to stay in the dark.
Light makes it worse.

52:56.998 --> 53:00.839
It's extremely painful.
Especially coming with scotoma.

53:03.998 --> 53:05.199
No. Only one of you.

53:10.278 --> 53:11.198
Come in.

53:28.797 --> 53:30.118
Goldman?

53:30.917 --> 53:34.078
Reminds me of a case,
I forget the details...

53:34.797 --> 53:36.638
A police officer.
He was my husband.

53:37.158 --> 53:38.878
His killers were never arrested.

53:39.278 --> 53:41.958
We have a good idea,
but the courts want proof.

53:42.517 --> 53:44.398
You know how it is.

53:45.317 --> 53:46.118
I see.

53:46.797 --> 53:48.078
Let's talk about Mattei.

53:48.678 --> 53:50.958
Apparently,
you think he killed Papalardo?

53:51.957 --> 53:53.118
Why suspect him?

53:53.477 --> 53:55.518
You were in business.
You stayed friends.

53:56.118 --> 53:57.918
Since he got shot, he's gone crazy.

53:58.118 --> 54:00.438
He's paranoid.
He was always jealous of me.

54:00.638 --> 54:02.798
We started out together
and look at him now.

54:03.477 --> 54:04.918
If people knew what he's like...

54:05.317 --> 54:06.398
He's sick!

54:07.717 --> 54:10.917
I remember one time,
he flew a plane over to Algeria

54:11.117 --> 54:13.157
to find a guy who owed him money.

54:13.356 --> 54:16.077
He dragged the guy
out of his village,

54:16.277 --> 54:18.197
starved him for a week,

54:18.396 --> 54:20.957
then chopped him up.
He skinned him like a tomato!

54:21.157 --> 54:23.477
- You called the police, I hope?
- What's the point?

54:23.796 --> 54:25.557
You know he killed Papalardo

54:26.237 --> 54:28.557
and what do you do?
Wait for him to d-die?

54:29.476 --> 54:31.637
Losing your temper
won't help your migraine.

54:31.996 --> 54:33.957
I lose my temper c-calmly.

54:34.157 --> 54:36.877
But do nothing
and I'll lose it for g-good!

54:37.637 --> 54:38.797
Is that a threat?

54:40.717 --> 54:43.677
We both know
who does what in this city.

54:43.876 --> 54:46.717
I'm a police officer.
I arrest a few hoodlums,

54:46.916 --> 54:50.157
but when it comes to the big fish,
it gets tricky.

54:50.637 --> 54:52.317
Manpower shortages,
budget restrictions,

54:52.516 --> 54:55.117
arrest warrants withheld,
questioning impossible...

54:55.597 --> 54:56.517
It's weird.

54:59.157 --> 55:00.197
You don't like me.

55:00.516 --> 55:02.837
I do my job
and keep feelings out of it.

55:07.236 --> 55:08.236
You know...

55:08.915 --> 55:11.276
I truly wish we could be friends.

55:11.475 --> 55:14.476
It can't be easy for a young widow
to raise her son.

55:14.955 --> 55:16.116
Who told you I have a son?

55:17.036 --> 55:18.276
A guess.

55:18.915 --> 55:21.316
If I can help in anyway.
It's dull,

55:21.515 --> 55:25.196
but material advantages
often ease other difficulties.

55:26.515 --> 55:29.236
When I say Mattei's lost it
and needs watching,

55:29.556 --> 55:31.916
I'm not necessarily a citizen
talking to the police...

55:32.116 --> 55:35.676
I could be
a friend talking to a friend.

55:38.315 --> 55:40.716
I earn my living
without owing anybody anything.

55:43.475 --> 55:45.636
I'll note
your suggested angle of inquiry.

55:45.835 --> 55:48.396
Maybe I'll take it into account.
Maybe not.

55:49.955 --> 55:51.716
Look after yourself, Mr. Zacchia.

57:29.353 --> 57:30.114
Shut up!

57:31.353 --> 57:31.914
Yes?

57:32.674 --> 57:33.274
Stick with him.

57:34.393 --> 57:35.474
Walk to heel!

57:46.594 --> 57:47.554
Hungry?

57:59.114 --> 58:00.994
I always drizzle olive oil on it.

58:03.593 --> 58:05.033
Nice of you to keep me company.

58:08.233 --> 58:09.353
What's your verdict?

58:11.792 --> 58:15.193
I know, I'm behind schedule.
When I'm done, it'll be superb.

58:15.472 --> 58:16.633
The Corsair.

58:17.872 --> 58:19.593
I'll call it The Corsair.

58:20.392 --> 58:21.273
Good name, huh?

58:22.193 --> 58:24.593
My son, Anatole, is like me.
He loves the sea.

58:25.312 --> 58:27.233
It's the only place I'm happy.

58:28.073 --> 58:29.633
Storms sneak up on you,

58:29.832 --> 58:32.393
but you see other boats coming
from miles away.

58:34.153 --> 58:35.673
That's the difference.

58:45.073 --> 58:47.433
I had a dog, you know.
He was alcoholic.

58:47.872 --> 58:51.353
One day, I gave him a sip
and after that he begged for more.

58:51.952 --> 58:53.353
He drank wine and Pastis.

58:53.553 --> 58:55.673
The booze made him very aggressive.

58:55.872 --> 58:57.993
So, no, I won't give you any.

58:58.352 --> 58:58.993
Understand?

01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:14.071
What's wrong?

01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:16.551
You gave me a fright.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:17.631
I wasn't followed.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:18.991
You shouldn't have come.

01:00:19.191 --> 01:00:20.831
I had to see you.
Zac's gone mad.

01:00:21.071 --> 01:00:23.951
They destroyed everything.
Stables, house, office...

01:00:24.151 --> 01:00:25.311
Even your mother's.

01:00:26.111 --> 01:00:27.791
They try to flush us out
and you run.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:29.591
Where with Clotilde?

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:32.231
I can't hide. She needs treatment.
This stinks.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.151
- You have to get out.
- They're here.

01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:40.631
The speedboat. Run!

01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:43.431
That's impossible.

01:00:49.551 --> 01:00:51.351
Get lost now. Hurry.

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:42.670
Hello, counsel.

01:02:21.388 --> 01:02:22.549
You're losing him!

01:02:33.669 --> 01:02:34.229
Get close!

01:02:37.308 --> 01:02:38.349
Closer, I said!

01:03:40.668 --> 01:03:41.388
Can you hear us?

01:04:02.107 --> 01:04:03.867
Martin, next time you know
where he is,

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:05.587
I'd like you,

01:04:06.187 --> 01:04:07.467
as an old friend, to tell me.

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:13.907
Or else I might take offense.

01:04:22.267 --> 01:04:24.827
Give Clotilde my love.
I'll let you get the tab.

01:04:29.426 --> 01:04:32.267
Were you missing
the hospital or the prison?

01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:33.587
Neither. You!

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:37.667
I wanted to see you again.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.347
So you're not confessing
to the murder

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:41.587
of Ange Papalardo
and Bastien Paolini?

01:04:41.786 --> 01:04:43.987
Murder? I thought it was suicide.

01:04:44.187 --> 01:04:47.107
A bullet in the heart, one
in the head. That's your signature.

01:04:48.227 --> 01:04:52.387
I can't even write. Don't believe
everything people tell you.

01:04:52.746 --> 01:04:53.946
Whatever people say,

01:04:54.425 --> 01:04:56.226
I know you've hidden your family.

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.866
I know you've killed two men
and want more revenge.

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:03.506
We all want revenge.
On our family, our childhood,

01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:05.226
or our enemies.

01:05:05.785 --> 01:05:06.826
You have no enemies?

01:05:07.226 --> 01:05:08.506
Not as many as you.

01:05:09.186 --> 01:05:10.866
Maybe we have one in common.

01:05:12.465 --> 01:05:14.106
I'm a victim of my reputation.

01:05:14.505 --> 01:05:16.506
Your hard-earned reputation.

01:05:16.905 --> 01:05:19.986
The truth is duller.
I live a very quiet retired life.

01:05:20.186 --> 01:05:21.626
Retired from what?

01:05:22.066 --> 01:05:25.466
I did a lot of things.
Complaints manager, artistic director,

01:05:25.865 --> 01:05:28.106
horse breeder.
I paid my dues.

01:05:28.465 --> 01:05:31.306
And you've no idea what happened
to Papalardo and Paolini?

01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:33.506
God called them.

01:05:34.026 --> 01:05:36.506
God's been calling a lot of people.

01:05:36.746 --> 01:05:38.586
Mostly guys who tried to kill you.

01:05:38.785 --> 01:05:41.066
If you knew it was them,
why not arrest them?

01:05:41.425 --> 01:05:42.906
No proof. Same with you.

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.226
Divine justice
beats the human version.

01:05:45.706 --> 01:05:47.186
You're very religious.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:48.265
It helps.

01:05:51.705 --> 01:05:54.865
Among your attackers,
one was trying not to kill you.

01:05:55.145 --> 01:05:57.305
He fired high
and slightly to your left.

01:05:58.025 --> 01:05:59.305
A bad shot.

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:01.985
He hit an area
the size of an orange.

01:06:02.545 --> 01:06:04.545
He aimed to one side on purpose.

01:06:04.944 --> 01:06:06.625
Of the five gunmen, only he missed.

01:06:06.864 --> 01:06:07.585
Five gunmen?

01:06:07.784 --> 01:06:10.385
Eight in all. A lookout,
two drivers, five gunmen.

01:06:10.585 --> 01:06:11.705
I didn't count them.

01:06:11.904 --> 01:06:14.905
Next time I get shot,
I promise to pay more attention.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:22.865
You're free to go.

01:06:28.344 --> 01:06:30.225
I'd love rabbit with mustard sauce.

01:06:30.424 --> 01:06:32.185
- We just had lunch, Mom.
- Really?

01:06:32.384 --> 01:06:34.625
Yes, we ate at Colombe's.

01:06:34.864 --> 01:06:36.105
That's a pity.

01:06:37.185 --> 01:06:39.185
So, no rabbit with mustard sauce?

01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:41.745
Mom, we're in the middle of a park.

01:06:50.943 --> 01:06:51.824
Jo...

01:06:52.823 --> 01:06:55.584
I'd love some rabbit
with mustard sauce.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:22.664
Thank you.

01:08:02.502 --> 01:08:03.503
Good to see you.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.103
Evening, Franck.

01:08:28.702 --> 01:08:29.903
Come with me, my friend.

01:08:30.381 --> 01:08:31.183
Let me introduce you.

01:08:31.502 --> 01:08:33.582
Pierre Desbois, you've met,

01:08:33.783 --> 01:08:35.582
the Minister's chief of staff.

01:08:35.943 --> 01:08:37.582
Senator Charles Barbaroux...

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:40.582
Eugene Carreda,
speaker of the state legislature,

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.462
an important gentleman.

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.261
My friend Aurelio Rampoli...

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:50.301
You blew my foot off, you sicko!

01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:52.142
We're gonna have a chat.

01:08:52.822 --> 01:08:54.102
Screw you, I'm no snitch!

01:08:54.301 --> 01:08:56.982
I'll tell your pals
about your moment of heroism.

01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:05.822
We're all out.
Where the hell's Rabou?

01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:07.221
Call him.

01:09:07.701 --> 01:09:08.982
Call an ambulance, I'm dying!

01:09:09.221 --> 01:09:10.582
You have a few liters left.

01:09:15.341 --> 01:09:16.582
Listen, Franck...

01:09:17.142 --> 01:09:19.341
In the garage,
there was Bastien, Papalardo,

01:09:19.541 --> 01:09:22.822
Fontarosa, Malek,
young Morvelous and Zac...

01:09:23.022 --> 01:09:23.662
Who was No. 8?

01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:28.301
The warehouse maybe?

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:30.462
Go check.

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:34.062
He got out of Zac's car
with a hood on.

01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:35.261
I never saw his face.

01:09:36.221 --> 01:09:37.462
Why would I lie?

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:41.221
A stranger turns up for a hit
and you don't ask any questions?

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.381
Franck, you can do better than that.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.781
Of course I asked.
Fontarosa blew me off.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.421
That's all I know.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.060
Wait!

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.901
It's Zac you want?
I don't wanna die for him.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.741
I'll get you the fucker.

01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:04.061
Please...
Thank you.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.821
Senator, Mr. Chief of Staff

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.261
Aurelio,

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.581
my friends...

01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:12.981
I'm delighted to see you here.

01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:15.301
The party is exactly as Idreamt it.

01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:17.941
Of course, they say Tony Zacchia

01:10:18.221 --> 01:10:22.061
is an obsessive, a perfectionist,
a maniac even,

01:10:23.181 --> 01:10:24.821
who blow up for no reason.

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.421
Malek, isn't that true?

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.381
Liar!

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:34.101
I know what people say
and they're right.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.461
Partly.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.141
Truth is,
I don't like to hurt people.

01:10:38.499 --> 01:10:40.860
When I do, I don't mean it.

01:10:41.619 --> 01:10:43.260
It just comes out.

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:46.140
Deep down, I hate people attacking
what's sacred.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220
For me,

01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:50.860
family and friends

01:10:51.619 --> 01:10:52.300
are sacred.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.620
Friendship isn't an empty word.

01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:57.820
Friendship implies responsibilities,

01:10:58.499 --> 01:10:59.660
obligations,

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.780
respect.
Whatever happens,

01:11:03.499 --> 01:11:04.780
I'll respect my friends.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.140
I installed the firewall
and passwords.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.580
See?

01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:31.220
- Can I...
- Fast!

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:45.259
Everything on the dope,
accounts, contacts,

01:11:45.578 --> 01:11:48.179
suppliers, amounts,
delivery dates, bookkeeping,

01:11:48.378 --> 01:11:50.139
deals, the guys he bribed...

01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:52.139
Aurelio never saw this.

01:11:52.378 --> 01:11:53.579
Zac's taken him for a ride,

01:11:53.819 --> 01:11:55.139
screwed him for a fortune.

01:12:00.819 --> 01:12:02.259
Zac'll eat out of your hand.

01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.379
You've got him.
He can't hurt you now.

01:12:53.657 --> 01:12:55.538
Morvelous just called.
He's been shot.

01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:57.938
- Let's go.
- With Malek?

01:12:58.138 --> 01:12:59.538
Not on his wedding night.

01:13:01.218 --> 01:13:02.898
Please, Charly!

01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:04.618
For the love of God...

01:13:05.697 --> 01:13:07.338
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

01:13:07.737 --> 01:13:10.338
Her mother walked out on us.
I'm all she has.

01:13:10.778 --> 01:13:12.298
Think of my kid, Charly!

01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:14.138
You have a daughter? Where?

01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:17.778
At my mother's tonight.
I'm picking her up tomorrow morning.

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:20.098
Please, I want to see her again.

01:13:20.858 --> 01:13:21.578
I wanna see her.

01:13:22.337 --> 01:13:24.858
Look...
This belongs to her.

01:13:41.456 --> 01:13:42.857
She plays with this?

01:13:46.257 --> 01:13:47.257
It's dangerous for a kid.

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.497
Forgive me, Charly.

01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:52.617
Forgive me.

01:13:54.456 --> 01:13:56.737
I forgive what you did to me.

01:13:58.897 --> 01:14:01.297
But I can't forgive
what your dogs did to Karim.

01:14:07.057 --> 01:14:08.457
You let him get away!

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.457
Asshole! Why'd you let him get away?

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:14.937
You asshole!

01:14:15.257 --> 01:14:17.017
Why'd you let him get away?

01:14:42.936 --> 01:14:43.856
Find him.

01:14:44.295 --> 01:14:45.816
Find the son of a bitch!

01:14:47.096 --> 01:14:49.256
Eradicate his family,
to the last one.

01:14:52.936 --> 01:14:54.576
If you miss him, I'll kill you!

01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:01.816
Hold on...

01:15:02.056 --> 01:15:03.616
You answer when you're driving?

01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:06.616
It's illegal
to drive and talk on the phone.

01:15:06.896 --> 01:15:08.536
Give me it. It's Zac.

01:15:08.735 --> 01:15:11.096
Let him watch us fuck too, why not!

01:15:11.295 --> 01:15:14.056
- Yasmina!
- Did you see him tonight?

01:15:14.535 --> 01:15:17.576
Like it was his wedding.
The Godmother and his courtiers.

01:15:17.816 --> 01:15:19.736
Don't call him that.
If he hears you...

01:15:21.695 --> 01:15:23.256
He isn't here.

01:15:24.776 --> 01:15:26.136
Stop being paranoid.

01:15:26.575 --> 01:15:27.816
Where was I?

01:15:33.374 --> 01:15:35.055
What's that asshole doing?

01:15:40.255 --> 01:15:42.135
Don't get mad!

01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:45.655
You're blocking my driveway!

01:15:50.935 --> 01:15:52.535
I'm talking to you.

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:06.255
Well?

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:09.455
We found a print on the gun.

01:16:10.574 --> 01:16:12.975
A beautiful right ring finger print.

01:16:13.895 --> 01:16:15.135
We know the owner?

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:17.455
You could say. Charly Mattei.

01:16:38.934 --> 01:16:40.214
You're crazy.
Zac's hunting you.

01:16:40.533 --> 01:16:42.614
He'll never come looking
for me here.

01:16:43.254 --> 01:16:44.214
What's going on?

01:16:45.014 --> 01:16:47.534
They're trying to finger me
for hits I didn't do.

01:16:53.333 --> 01:16:54.374
What's that?

01:16:55.733 --> 01:16:58.574
Zacchia's will. Very interesting.

01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:01.814
Keep it safe,
make a copy and take it to Aurelio.

01:17:02.533 --> 01:17:03.734
Deliver it personally.

01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:08.454
A smart crook doesn't exist.

01:17:08.653 --> 01:17:10.174
Top IQs don't join the mafia.

01:17:10.373 --> 01:17:11.374
Sir!

01:17:11.613 --> 01:17:14.574
A pro like Mattei
wouldn't leave a gun with his prints

01:17:14.774 --> 01:17:15.974
next to a corpse.
It's a set-up.

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:17.414
A set-up for idiots.

01:17:17.613 --> 01:17:19.494
There's a manhole
he could have dropped it in.

01:17:20.054 --> 01:17:21.094
Proves he's a moron.

01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:23.454
We have an international
arrest warrant.

01:17:23.653 --> 01:17:26.774
Whatever it takes, find him
and put him away for twenty years.

01:17:26.973 --> 01:17:29.173
That'll clear the horizon.
And clear out too.

01:17:58.013 --> 01:17:58.813
Yes?

01:18:00.253 --> 01:18:01.693
No, put him on.

01:18:03.013 --> 01:18:04.573
What's wrong, sweetheart?

01:18:06.692 --> 01:18:09.053
No, I'm still working.
I'll be home soon.

01:18:09.572 --> 01:18:11.773
Yes, I'll come give you a kiss.
I promise.

01:18:13.572 --> 01:18:14.453
What nightmare?

01:18:14.973 --> 01:18:16.973
Don't worry, angel.

01:18:17.173 --> 01:18:20.333
There aren't any thieves.
Dolores scares them off.

01:18:22.253 --> 01:18:25.413
Go to bed. It's late
and you have school tomorrow.

01:18:29.132 --> 01:18:30.652
You idiot!

01:18:31.852 --> 01:18:32.892
I love you, sweetie.

01:18:46.012 --> 01:18:49.012
Mattei has a son.
He must go to school somewhere.

01:18:49.212 --> 01:18:50.972
Tomorrow morning,
find out where.

01:18:51.172 --> 01:18:53.212
You're looking for an Anatole Mattei

01:18:53.411 --> 01:18:55.212
or Anatole Kolarov.

01:18:55.411 --> 01:18:57.332
Not so fast, I didn't get any of it.

01:18:57.531 --> 01:18:58.172
Kolarov.

01:18:59.892 --> 01:19:01.132
That's his mother's name.

01:19:01.331 --> 01:19:04.852
Search for all of France.
The kid will lead us to him.

01:19:05.052 --> 01:19:06.932
He must be in contact with his family.

01:19:19.932 --> 01:19:21.292
- I saw you.
- Liar!

01:19:31.685 --> 01:19:33.205
So, who's your girlfriend?

01:19:33.924 --> 01:19:34.885
Sandra.

01:19:35.084 --> 01:19:36.325
She looks nice.

01:19:37.964 --> 01:19:39.725
Can I invite her to my birthday?

01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:41.285
We'll ask your mother.

01:19:42.124 --> 01:19:43.125
I understand.

01:19:45.204 --> 01:19:46.085
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:19:46.485 --> 01:19:47.925
No, not right now.

01:19:49.324 --> 01:19:51.245
How will you have children then?

01:19:51.445 --> 01:19:53.685
I'm not sure I'm cut out for kids.

01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:07.885
Your dad wants you in the back.

01:20:22.923 --> 01:20:23.484
Asshole!

01:20:23.684 --> 01:20:24.804
No, Anatole!

01:20:25.043 --> 01:20:25.724
You said it.

01:20:25.923 --> 01:20:26.684
I have a license.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:28.444
A license to say bad words?

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:30.684
Some, under strict rules.

01:20:31.003 --> 01:20:33.284
When I have a license,
can I say "asshole"?

01:20:33.923 --> 01:20:34.484
Sure, but...

01:20:34.684 --> 01:20:35.884
What a jerk!

01:20:44.203 --> 01:20:44.924
Get down!

01:20:52.203 --> 01:20:53.004
Stop!

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.604
Please!

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:04.164
Help!

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:07.124
Let's go!

01:21:25.443 --> 01:21:28.083
Sorry,
I can't send a car for that.

01:21:29.322 --> 01:21:31.003
Give me your address anyway.

01:21:32.282 --> 01:21:33.123
We found Eva.

01:21:34.162 --> 01:21:35.123
And Anatole?

01:21:36.042 --> 01:21:36.643
Follow me.

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:51.163
Tell me what happened.
You're safe now.

01:21:51.683 --> 01:21:53.683
We found her at a gas station.

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:03.243
What happened to you both?

01:22:04.563 --> 01:22:06.123
What did they do to you?

01:22:10.443 --> 01:22:11.643
Talk to me, sweetheart.

01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:15.483
Where's Anatole?

01:22:19.482 --> 01:22:20.322
They...

01:22:23.802 --> 01:22:25.562
They said they'd kill him if...

01:22:26.402 --> 01:22:27.962
if dad doesn't surrender.

01:22:49.088 --> 01:22:50.528
It's your call.
Arrest me,

01:22:50.727 --> 01:22:52.968
get congratulations and a promotion,

01:22:53.287 --> 01:22:54.888
but Zacchia kills my son.

01:22:55.088 --> 01:22:57.728
He'll kill him
because he respects nothing.

01:22:57.928 --> 01:23:00.608
Not a kid's life, not a cop's life,
as you know.

01:23:00.808 --> 01:23:02.888
We both know
he had your husband killed

01:23:03.088 --> 01:23:05.088
and we both know he'll kill my boy.

01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:10.408
I have a proposal for you.

01:23:11.367 --> 01:23:13.608
Announce I gave myself in,
but let me go.

01:23:14.487 --> 01:23:17.888
If Zacchia thinks I'm in jail,
he'll lower his guard.

01:23:18.087 --> 01:23:20.687
Zac's not stupid enough to keep
my son with him

01:23:20.887 --> 01:23:22.727
and he never gives orders
over the phone.

01:23:22.927 --> 01:23:24.847
The second
he thinks I'm out of the game,

01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:26.527
he'll order his murder.

01:23:26.726 --> 01:23:28.767
I know who does his dirty work.

01:23:29.847 --> 01:23:33.247
I can only find my son
if Zacchia thinks I'm in jail.

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:34.687
You expect me to agree?

01:23:34.887 --> 01:23:36.847
When my son's safe, I'll surrender.

01:23:37.526 --> 01:23:39.727
I don't care about your old scores.

01:23:40.207 --> 01:23:41.887
I have a tough job to do

01:23:42.087 --> 01:23:44.967
and if I listen to a gangster,
I won't be doing it right.

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:47.967
You know what it's like
to lose a loved one.

01:23:49.007 --> 01:23:51.647
I am what I am.
However bad that is,

01:23:51.847 --> 01:23:55.007
my son didn't ask to be part of it.
He'll die if...

01:24:01.807 --> 01:24:03.127
I'm begging you.

01:24:07.927 --> 01:24:11.727
A new twist in the brutal
gangland war terrorizing Marseille.

01:24:11.927 --> 01:24:15.007
Officials claim Charly Mattei
has been arrested

01:24:15.206 --> 01:24:18.766
and is currently in custody
at police HQ.

01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:21.446
The man nicknamed the Immortal
did not resist,

01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:23.606
according to Marseille police,

01:24:23.806 --> 01:24:25.966
delighted by his arrest.

01:24:26.206 --> 01:24:29.726
Foreign new now.
Tomorrow, the US President starts...

01:24:37.886 --> 01:24:39.806
Ensure no one finds the body.
Nothing.

01:24:41.006 --> 01:24:41.886
Ever.

01:24:42.525 --> 01:24:43.886
Leave the boy out of this.

01:24:44.725 --> 01:24:47.406
Charly killed Malek, a son to me.
I'll take his.

01:24:48.605 --> 01:24:49.526
He won't get closure.

01:24:50.405 --> 01:24:53.406
I want it to ruin his life,
to kill him very slowly.

01:24:53.605 --> 01:24:55.446
A souvenir, like the last time?

01:24:55.645 --> 01:24:57.526
An ear or a finger, whatever.

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.846
To drive his whore insane.

01:25:01.525 --> 01:25:02.846
And you kill Aurelio.

01:25:03.325 --> 01:25:04.206
Tonight.

01:25:05.086 --> 01:25:07.246
Boss, I need a crew, stake him out.

01:25:07.445 --> 01:25:09.446
Forget that.
Drive by on a bike, okay?

01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:15.806
In return, you can run the hotel
I bought near the station.

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:18.685
With all the whores and johns,
it's easy money. Go!

01:25:27.444 --> 01:25:30.485
- Where's Goldman?
- The basement interrogation room.

01:25:30.684 --> 01:25:32.005
How do I know, though?

01:25:50.925 --> 01:25:51.725
Open up.

01:25:56.324 --> 01:25:58.045
- What's going on?
- Sorry?

01:25:58.245 --> 01:25:59.445
Where's Mattei?

01:25:59.644 --> 01:26:01.125
We haven't found him yet,

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:03.045
but new evidence has turned up.

01:27:20.362 --> 01:27:21.883
That how you keep guard?

01:27:49.883 --> 01:27:51.243
Mattei's been arrested.

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:53.603
- What do we do now?
- Kill him.

01:27:53.923 --> 01:27:55.683
The boss wants a memento.

01:27:56.083 --> 01:27:57.563
We can't.
He's just a kid.

01:27:57.763 --> 01:27:59.203
Is he yours?
What do you care?

01:28:00.722 --> 01:28:02.523
Move! Get shovels and bags.

01:28:20.481 --> 01:28:21.562
I only found one.

01:28:22.082 --> 01:28:23.562
In the car!
We're not gonna do it here!

01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:26.682
I can't.

01:28:27.762 --> 01:28:29.202
I didn't ask your opinion.

01:28:29.401 --> 01:28:30.882
Move it or I'll shiv you.

01:28:51.242 --> 01:28:52.202
It'll be okay, kid.

01:28:59.762 --> 01:29:01.762
Shut up!
I said, shut up!

01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:03.162
Shut your mouth!

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.561
No, please!

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.440
I'll bleed you like your pal.

01:30:46.599 --> 01:30:47.680
It's me.

01:30:48.559 --> 01:30:49.560
It's daddy.

01:30:52.439 --> 01:30:53.640
It's all over.

01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:37.399
I'll turn myself in.

01:31:39.759 --> 01:31:42.119
We can't go on the run.
It's unfair on you.

01:31:42.678 --> 01:31:44.119
On the kids, too.

01:31:46.558 --> 01:31:48.919
You can start over
have a normal life.

01:31:52.239 --> 01:31:53.239
I'm staying with you.

01:32:34.437 --> 01:32:36.118
Aurelio'll live.
He had a vest.

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.838
We have five corpses
and one wounded.

01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:40.638
- Weapons?
- Cleaned up before we got here.

01:32:40.838 --> 01:32:42.958
- So we have nothing?
- Not quite.

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:44.718
This was in Aurelio's pocket.

01:33:09.436 --> 01:33:10.317
Sonia?

01:33:14.636 --> 01:33:15.717
Kids?

01:33:50.516 --> 01:33:51.637
He helped me a lot.

01:33:52.077 --> 01:33:54.037
He's not just a healer.

01:33:54.757 --> 01:33:58.117
He appears to the faithful
to forewarn them of their death.

01:33:58.315 --> 01:34:01.636
Three knocks on the bed
means you have three days to live.

01:34:02.435 --> 01:34:04.236
He didn't knock three days ago?

01:34:04.515 --> 01:34:06.356
What have you done to my family?

01:34:06.956 --> 01:34:09.316
I never involve women and children.

01:34:11.196 --> 01:34:12.316
Help me understand.

01:34:12.555 --> 01:34:14.836
Understand?
Understand what?

01:34:20.836 --> 01:34:22.356
Why did you do it?

01:34:24.555 --> 01:34:25.556
Business.

01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:27.236
Not that. Not this business.

01:34:27.675 --> 01:34:29.836
"Friends till after we die."
Remember?

01:34:31.236 --> 01:34:34.396
Stupidest thing I ever said.
Friends till after we die!

01:34:35.076 --> 01:34:36.996
We grew up together
and aged differently.

01:34:37.196 --> 01:34:38.836
With your whore, like a coward!

01:34:39.395 --> 01:34:41.116
Retired. The quiet life.

01:34:41.515 --> 01:34:42.716
Judging everyone else.

01:34:43.156 --> 01:34:44.596
I kept fighting.

01:34:44.956 --> 01:34:46.716
I had to draw the line.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:49.636
Dope? That's the line?
Morality? Not very original.

01:34:49.836 --> 01:34:52.716
Morality never is.
In fact, it's pretty boring.

01:34:52.956 --> 01:34:55.636
You think you're different?
Better?

01:34:56.235 --> 01:34:58.195
We're the same.
You're no better than me.

01:34:58.394 --> 01:35:00.435
To get here, we played rough.

01:35:00.755 --> 01:35:04.075
We got rid of people.
You went straight, big deal.

01:35:04.274 --> 01:35:06.915
You have blood on your hands.
It won't wash off.

01:35:07.155 --> 01:35:09.555
You'll be what you always were,
a bad guy,

01:35:09.755 --> 01:35:12.515
a gangster who broke the rules.
Don't lecture me.

01:35:12.714 --> 01:35:15.355
I lost, kill me,
but not in the name of morality.

01:35:16.155 --> 01:35:17.635
I wanted to end in peace.

01:35:17.835 --> 01:35:18.715
Me too.

01:35:19.075 --> 01:35:22.515
But I had to eliminate you for that.
Your morality's selective.

01:35:23.714 --> 01:35:25.355
Rackets, but no drugs.

01:35:25.554 --> 01:35:27.475
Revenge, but don't hurt families.

01:35:27.674 --> 01:35:28.915
Kill, but not cops.

01:35:29.115 --> 01:35:31.355
Outdated bullshit!
Evil is evil.

01:35:31.674 --> 01:35:33.635
It's in us, so deal with it.

01:35:35.235 --> 01:35:36.675
I know you don't agree.

01:35:37.155 --> 01:35:39.515
You'll kill me
because the truth hurts.

01:35:43.235 --> 01:35:45.675
I'll kill you
because you betrayed me.

01:35:47.915 --> 01:35:48.835
Well?

01:35:49.474 --> 01:35:50.955
What are you waiting for?

01:35:58.673 --> 01:36:01.194
Don't think too long
or you get nothing done.

01:36:34.114 --> 01:36:36.474
Yes, we aged differently.
My reflexes are better.

01:36:37.114 --> 01:36:39.154
Honesty makes you rusty.
Give me that.

01:36:41.593 --> 01:36:43.954
Three days to live?
No, years yet.

01:36:44.154 --> 01:36:46.354
You'll regret
surviving your injuries.

01:36:47.754 --> 01:36:49.034
Unless you beg me.

01:36:51.154 --> 01:36:52.674
Beg me, Charly.

01:36:59.793 --> 01:37:01.433
You're the biggest shit I know.

01:37:08.953 --> 01:37:10.113
I said beg me!

01:37:16.793 --> 01:37:17.833
Police! Freeze!

01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:19.473
Throw your guns down!

01:37:19.672 --> 01:37:21.033
Flat on the floor!

01:37:21.233 --> 01:37:22.313
Don't move!

01:37:33.873 --> 01:37:37.153
Tony Zacchia, I'm arresting you

01:37:37.352 --> 01:37:40.073
on charges of fraud
and embezzlement.

01:37:40.512 --> 01:37:42.353
He came here to murder me!

01:37:42.913 --> 01:37:44.753
I ha-haven't done anything.

01:37:44.953 --> 01:37:48.273
Tony Zacchia's downfall
sends out a message to Marseille,

01:37:48.472 --> 01:37:50.113
to the whole region

01:37:50.312 --> 01:37:52.273
and all of France even.

01:37:54.631 --> 01:37:56.872
Our city's entering
a new era at last,

01:37:57.072 --> 01:37:59.112
partly thanks to you, captain.

01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.632
I congratulate you
for your determination.

01:38:02.152 --> 01:38:06.032
The Minister will visit next week
to congratulate us.

01:38:06.232 --> 01:38:10.032
I'm sure you'll take the chance
to put our differences behind us

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:13.392
and praise my battle
against the mafia.

01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:15.672
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

01:38:15.872 --> 01:38:17.712
Let me make it quite clear.

01:38:18.112 --> 01:38:20.152
An Internal Affairs report
would reveal

01:38:20.351 --> 01:38:23.312
a chronic alcohol problem
since your husband's death

01:38:23.952 --> 01:38:26.872
and an addiction
to one-arm bandits in cheap bars.

01:38:27.232 --> 01:38:29.112
But that's a pee in the ocean

01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:32.352
compared to actively helping
Charly Mattei on the run.

01:38:32.912 --> 01:38:36.472
And we may throw in
the tracking device on your car.

01:38:36.752 --> 01:38:40.152
When the Minister
makes his surprise visit,

01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:42.632
you'll be queen for the day,

01:38:42.832 --> 01:38:45.672
so make sure he know
you owe it all to me,

01:38:46.912 --> 01:38:48.352
and the rest is our secret.

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:54.991
If you've finished,
I'll go fight your war on the mob.

01:38:55.191 --> 01:38:56.351
Be my guest.

01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:04.111
One last thing, sir.

01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:11.791
Our secret, too.

01:39:14.911 --> 01:39:17.511
The cops hassled me
for jobs I didn't do.

01:39:17.710 --> 01:39:20.031
For jobs I did,
they never came by once.

01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:23.151
Gangsters may be dumb,
but you're no better.

01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.871
You weren't in Marseille?

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:32.871
You didn't murder Malek Telaa?

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:37.511
And you've no idea who did.

01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:46.511
You don't recognize this gun?

01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:51.070
Never seen it before.

01:39:51.269 --> 01:39:52.990
How come your prints are on it?

01:39:56.469 --> 01:39:57.550
I don't know.

01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:02.430
Maybe I handled it in a gun store.

01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:04.070
A gun store?

01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:07.590
Do you have a gun license?

01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:10.830
Do I need one
to handle a gun in a gun store?

01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:13.750
Where'd you get that gun today?

01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:15.870
At Mr. Zacchia's.

01:40:19.269 --> 01:40:22.150
He claims you broke in to kill him.

01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:26.070
Broke in? He opened the door to me.
We're old friends, you know.

01:40:33.190 --> 01:40:35.350
Please read
and sign your statement.

01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:38.990
We'll deal with firearm possession

01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:41.190
and breaking and entering later,

01:40:41.509 --> 01:40:43.910
but that'll be child's play
for your lawyer.

01:41:04.869 --> 01:41:06.069
I can go?

01:41:07.749 --> 01:41:10.469
The fingerprints
confirmed Yasmina Telaa's evidence.

01:41:10.668 --> 01:41:12.189
The gunman was right-handed.

01:41:24.869 --> 01:41:26.069
Unlike you,

01:41:26.388 --> 01:41:29.429
your friend Zacchia
will be brought to justice.

01:41:29.628 --> 01:41:31.829
It won't be as summary as yours,

01:41:32.029 --> 01:41:33.589
but he faces a long stretch.

01:41:34.548 --> 01:41:37.789
Professionally, I have a sense
of having done my duty.

01:41:39.069 --> 01:41:40.509
Personally,

01:41:43.388 --> 01:41:45.109
I regret arriving too early.

01:41:46.148 --> 01:41:48.668
I know you refuse the sympathy
of a man like me,

01:41:48.868 --> 01:41:51.228
but we share
the same weak point...

01:41:51.748 --> 01:41:52.468
Family.

01:41:57.828 --> 01:42:00.388
I hope never
to see you here again.

01:42:09.108 --> 01:42:10.428
The last gunman...

01:42:10.788 --> 01:42:12.468
Zacchia didn't say who it was?

01:42:52.474 --> 01:42:53.915
I brought what you wanted.

01:42:58.915 --> 01:43:00.875
Christelle and the kids are home.

01:43:01.074 --> 01:43:02.675
She invited Karim's parents.

01:43:02.875 --> 01:43:04.955
I'd like us to go somewhere first.

01:43:05.234 --> 01:43:06.235
Of course.

01:43:08.194 --> 01:43:08.835
Where?

01:43:09.875 --> 01:43:11.275
Drive. I'll tell you.

01:43:33.394 --> 01:43:35.035
I'm in a strange business.

01:43:37.915 --> 01:43:39.235
If you decide to quit,

01:43:39.434 --> 01:43:40.755
one day, someone

01:43:40.954 --> 01:43:44.554
will knock on your door
to avenge a father, brother or uncle.

01:43:48.033 --> 01:43:49.914
You're doomed to stick at it

01:43:51.313 --> 01:43:52.594
until you die.

01:43:55.113 --> 01:43:57.394
Spilled blood never dries.

01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:17.034
Is this where they shot you?

01:44:21.033 --> 01:44:22.194
They?

01:44:24.073 --> 01:44:25.554
What were you doing there?

01:44:30.153 --> 01:44:33.674
Zac burst in to my office,
yelling there was big money at stake.

01:44:33.874 --> 01:44:36.714
I tried to duck out,
but he slapped a gun in my hand.

01:44:36.914 --> 01:44:39.874
I never thought it was you.
You weren't at war then.

01:44:40.072 --> 01:44:41.753
When I realized, it was too late.

01:45:03.272 --> 01:45:04.633
I didn't shoot at you.

01:45:05.392 --> 01:45:06.833
I aimed off to one side.

01:45:07.192 --> 01:45:08.233
I know.

01:45:08.833 --> 01:45:10.433
I'm begging you!

01:45:11.232 --> 01:45:12.273
Think of Clotilde.

01:45:12.993 --> 01:45:15.873
She's sick and weak.
She needs me.

01:45:16.192 --> 01:45:18.433
Who'll take care of her if I'm gone?

01:45:18.633 --> 01:45:20.073
She'll be hospitalized.

01:45:20.432 --> 01:45:22.073
Is that what you want?

01:45:22.593 --> 01:45:24.553
And your daughter...

01:45:24.873 --> 01:45:27.433
She's like my daughter.
Sorry to say this...

01:45:28.793 --> 01:45:30.113
but I'm a father to her.

01:45:31.032 --> 01:45:33.593
I can't abandon them. Not now.

01:45:33.953 --> 01:45:35.033
Not now.

01:45:35.312 --> 01:45:36.873
They won't forgive you.

01:46:15.511 --> 01:46:17.032
Now we're quits.

01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:49.351
My body's like a battlefield.

01:46:49.551 --> 01:46:51.031
But I'm still standing.

01:46:52.150 --> 01:46:54.311
I'll watch my children grow.

01:46:54.631 --> 01:46:58.271
I'll stay with my family,
as long as I possibly can.

01:46:59.070 --> 01:47:00.831
I'll get old quietly.

01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:02.311
Without hiding.

01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:07.351
Without always
looking over my shoulder.
