WEBVTT

00:06.374 --> 00:10.409
- And that's when I knew
I had seen my 7th UFO.

00:10.411 --> 00:15.147
- [laughing] Wow.
Another great story, Cherry.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.852
- BARB:
Kids?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.022
What happened to you?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.356
- We saved
a beached whale.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.593
Then it said thank you
by spitting seaweed on us.

00:28.596 --> 00:30.162
The save would've
gone smoother,

00:30.164 --> 00:31.964
if I had the land,
air and sea rocket

00:31.966 --> 00:33.532
I requested
from the Hero League.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.401
- Oh, the rocket shark.
- Yep.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.871
It goes from scuba to sky
in 2.8 seconds.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.906
- Hey, thanks for waiting
for me, Cherry.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.608
- Aw, it's cool,
but I can't hang out

00:42.610 --> 00:46.478
or else I'm gonna be late for
work at the Clam Castle.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.048
- If President Kickbutt had
just made you my supe assistant

00:49.050 --> 00:51.350
like I asked, your job
would be hangin' out with me.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.385
- I am very qualified
for that job.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.120
- I know!

00:56.190 --> 00:58.390
Know what? I'm gonna
call Kickbutt right now.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.558
- Not if I call
her, first.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.493
- Hey, kids! You can't
bother President Kickbutt

01:01.495 --> 01:05.531
with your frivolous requests.
- ALL: [gasping]

01:05.533 --> 01:07.533
- I have been called
a lot of things,

01:07.535 --> 01:11.437
but frivolous
is a word I don't know.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.107
- It means she's too busy
to take your silly requests--

01:15.109 --> 01:18.010
like last week when somebody
asked for space hair gel?

01:18.012 --> 01:21.346
- Do you think I want
my hair to look like yours?

01:22.349 --> 01:26.185
Okay, fine. We promise not
to call President Kickbutt.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.287
Thunder Monitor,
call President Kickbutt.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.323
- FEMALE VOICE: President
Kickbutt is not available.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.891
- Is she blocking
our calls?

01:32.893 --> 01:36.295
- FEMALE VOICE: Yes, but
you didn't hear it from me.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.665
- She can't hide from us.
Chloe?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.399
- [whooshing]

01:40.401 --> 01:43.202
- Hey, we need you to go
get President Kickbutt.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.371
- I guess my tea
party can wait.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.372
[whooshing]

01:47.374 --> 01:48.574
- So, did I ever
tell you guys

01:48.576 --> 01:52.177
that I once met an alien
named Gramulak?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.547
[laughing]
Funny story.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.381
- [whooshing]

01:56.383 --> 01:59.351
- So, I say to
you supes--

01:59.353 --> 02:00.319
Why am I here?

02:00.321 --> 02:04.623
You kids interrupted my State
of the SuperUnion speech.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.191
- Sorry, but we
have some issues

02:06.193 --> 02:07.960
that are really,
really important.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.163
- Yeah, I need
my rocket shark.

02:11.165 --> 02:14.600
- I'll tell you what I told
you the last ten times--

02:14.602 --> 02:15.200
never!

02:15.202 --> 02:17.936
- Well, have you
reconsidered my 300 requests

02:17.938 --> 02:20.372
for Cherry to be
my supe assistant?

02:20.374 --> 02:22.407
- Here's my resume.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.111
- This is just
a picture of a cherry.

02:26.113 --> 02:30.949
- I feel like it sums up
my experience quite nicely.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.386
Nailed the interview!

02:35.389 --> 02:36.622
- I'm getting
out of here

02:36.624 --> 02:39.358
before anyone else
asks me for something.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.594
- Yo, Evelyn!

02:42.596 --> 02:44.129
How 'bout a date?

02:44.131 --> 02:46.398
- How about I end you?

02:47.001 --> 02:49.234
- That's not a "no."

02:49.670 --> 02:51.570
- Take a hint, Colosso.
She doesn't have time for you.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.506
- Yeah, she's here to give us
stuff, so I was thinking--

02:54.508 --> 02:57.576
- The rocket shark, it's like
this car, three wheels--

02:57.578 --> 02:58.343
- Enough!

02:58.345 --> 03:00.112
- But we're contenders
for the Z-Force.

03:00.114 --> 03:01.580
Helping us is part
of your job.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.116
- Maybe I don't want
this job anymore.

03:04.118 --> 03:07.186
- Well, you're the president.
You can't just quit.

03:07.188 --> 03:07.753
- Watch me!

03:07.755 --> 03:09.454
I quit!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:09.456 --> 03:12.191
Kids, I told you not to
call President Kickbutt.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.225
- Well, they can
call you now

03:13.227 --> 03:16.528
because you're the new
Hero League president.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.362
- Me?!

03:17.364 --> 03:20.465
- Regular citizen
Kickbutt, out!

03:21.202 --> 03:24.036
Psst! Chloe,
teleport me home.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.339
- [whooshing]

03:28.375 --> 03:30.409
- ¶

03:30.411 --> 03:31.510
¶ What you see ¶

03:31.512 --> 03:32.711
¶ Is not what you get ¶

03:32.713 --> 03:36.348
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

03:36.350 --> 03:38.050
¶ We fit right in ¶

03:38.052 --> 03:39.318
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

03:39.320 --> 03:41.019
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

03:41.021 --> 03:42.554
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

03:42.556 --> 03:44.423
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

03:44.425 --> 03:46.358
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

03:46.360 --> 03:47.759
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

03:47.761 --> 03:49.394
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

03:49.396 --> 03:51.296
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

03:51.298 --> 03:52.731
¶ It's our reality ¶

03:52.733 --> 03:53.799
¶ Just your average family ¶

03:53.801 --> 03:57.436
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

03:57.438 --> 04:01.707
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

04:04.445 --> 04:05.811
- ¶

04:05.813 --> 04:08.313
- Did you just make
President Kickbutt quit?

04:08.315 --> 04:11.550
- And did she just make
me the new president?

04:12.186 --> 04:13.619
Kids, you need
to fix this.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.221
- I feel terrible.
We didn't know she would quit.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.523
- Yeah, we just asked
her for a few things

04:18.525 --> 04:19.858
every day,
over and over.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.893
- Well, maybe Kickbutt
didn't mean it.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.596
She didn't even send
a presidential liaison.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.467
- Hello, I'm your
presidential liaison.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.869
Hank Thunderman,
I need to know

04:30.871 --> 04:32.671
if you'll accept
the nomination.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.338
- This is insane.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.340
Uh, sir, we need to speak
with President Kickbutt.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.508
- Oh, she's disappeared
to a place

04:36.510 --> 04:39.344
where you annoying Thundermans
would never find her.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.679
Her words, not mine.

04:40.681 --> 04:45.217
- Don't you speak that way
to the emperor's daughter.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.920
- I don't know.
It's a big decision.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.355
- Oh, it's bigger
than big.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.592
The Hero League will be without
a president, if you decline.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.361
I'll give you
some room to decide.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.600
- Phoebe, do you realize
what this means?

05:01.602 --> 05:05.203
- We drove poor Kickbutt
so crazy, she quit her job.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.738
Am I really that
annoying?

05:06.740 --> 05:07.806
Don't answer that.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.441
- No. Now that
Kickbutt's gone,

05:09.443 --> 05:10.609
we can get
everything we want.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.612
We just have to convince
Dad to become president.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.914
- Kickbutt did say
she's not coming back.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.517
And I do want Cherry
to be my assistant.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.084
- Uh-huh...

05:19.086 --> 05:21.386
- And I do love making
you wait for me to decide.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.822
- And you know you
want to! Come on!

05:23.991 --> 05:26.858
- I don't know. It's a really
big responsibility, honey.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.928
- But, Dad,
it only makes sense

05:29.930 --> 05:32.431
for the greatest
superhero who ever lived

05:32.433 --> 05:34.266
to become
the Hero League president.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.702
- Oh...I wouldn't
go that far.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.737
But you can.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.873
- And, Mom, you would make
an amazing First Lady.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.543
- Oh, I would,
wouldn't I.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.711
Once a simple farm girl,

05:45.713 --> 05:50.015
Barbara McBooger's
been picked for greatness.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.616
- Phoebe, look at them.

05:51.618 --> 05:54.820
Something's different.
- Yeah, you're right.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.022
They look almost...

05:57.024 --> 05:59.291
"presidential."

06:00.828 --> 06:02.494
- The superworld
needs us, honey.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.962
- Yeah.
- Mr. Liaison?

06:03.964 --> 06:08.700
It's time to make Hank Tiberius
Thunderman superpresident.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.602
- [laughing]
Wonderful!

06:10.604 --> 06:13.305
- NORA & BILLY:
Congratulations, Dad!

06:13.307 --> 06:16.908
- Congratulations, Max.
- Congratulations, Phoebe.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.779
- ¶

06:20.781 --> 06:24.783
- Okay, Mr. Thunderman,
after you've been sworn in,

06:24.785 --> 06:27.786
you'll take a bite
from the inaugural cake.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.655
- Ooh, my stomach
is ready to serve.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.958
- Superpresidents have
taken a ceremonial bite

06:32.960 --> 06:36.328
from the cake for
over 200 years.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.829
- Two hundred years old?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.031
Hope that comes
with a barf bag.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.368
- Oh, there it is--
in that dish.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.705
- [gasping]
- I'll be right back.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.974
I forgot to bring
the Hero League handbook.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.610
[laughing]
I'm a train wreck today.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.380
- Barb, I have to
tell you something.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.749
- You ate the cake.
- I ate the cake.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.051
- How? When? I have
so many questions!

07:00.053 --> 07:02.320
- I was coming back
from the bathroom.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.388
It was sitting there.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.689
I thought it was
hallway cake.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.726
- That's what you're going
with--hallway cake?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.494
- I don't know.
I am new to politics.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.962
- We can't have a scandal
on your first day.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.498
You'll go down as the worst
president in history.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.366
- Oh, you're right.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.767
No one can ever
know about this.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.571
I won't wanna be known as
Superpresident Cakebutt.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.642
- Let's begin the ceremony.
- HANK & BARB: Mm-hm.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.509
- Mr. Thunderman...
- Mm.

07:24.511 --> 07:28.647
- ...please place your hand
on the Hero League handbook.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.917
Do you swear to serve
the Hero League

07:31.919 --> 07:34.619
with the utmost honesty
and integrity?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.589
- Of course. Why do you ask?
What have you heard?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.924
I do.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.928
- Congratulations,
Mr. Superpresident!

07:42.930 --> 07:44.129
- CROWD:
[applauding, cheering]

07:44.131 --> 07:47.365
- Get to the cake,
people!

07:49.603 --> 07:50.202
- Oh, Hank...

07:50.204 --> 07:52.571
[whispering]
We have to do something.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.673
- Oh, uh...

07:54.675 --> 07:55.440
Let's skip the cake.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.609
Uh, fun fact about
your new president.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.612
I am a health freak.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.147
- Nonsense.
[slaps hand]

08:02.149 --> 08:04.749
It's tradition to
take a tiny sliver

08:04.751 --> 08:08.053
of the three-layered,
buttercream--

08:08.055 --> 08:12.424
Oh, my gosh, someone
ate the whole cake!

08:12.426 --> 08:12.958
What? Who?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.093
Whatever monster did this is
an enemy of the Hero League!

08:15.095 --> 08:17.696
- Mr. President, will you
launch an investigation

08:17.698 --> 08:18.630
to catch the cake eater?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.165
- Uh, yeah, of course
I'm gonna do that.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.566
That filthy criminal
will pay for eating

08:21.568 --> 08:24.469
that buttercream cake
with the chocolate spirals

08:24.471 --> 08:26.438
and delicate
vanilla chiffon--

08:26.440 --> 08:27.839
- They get it,
Mr. President.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.740
Neither of us will rest

08:28.742 --> 08:30.542
until we find this
unknown person

08:30.544 --> 08:33.712
who no one knows
the identity of.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.014
- Dad ate the cake,
right?

08:36.016 --> 08:38.650
- Oh, totally.
- Definitely.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.722
- Max, I'd like
to introduce you to

08:43.724 --> 08:46.491
my new supe
assistant, Cherry.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.462
- Oh, Ms. Thunderman,
you have a bestie

08:50.464 --> 08:52.464
dance break
scheduled in five minutes.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.433
- Oh, um, let's move
that to now.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.103
- [lively dance music]

09:00.641 --> 09:02.073
- CHERRY & PHOEBE:
[laughing]

09:02.075 --> 09:03.575
- Hey, Cherry,
can you, uh,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.710
pass a message
along to your boss?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.579
You're both dumb!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.181
- It is so cool
that President Dad

09:10.183 --> 09:11.783
approved you
working for me.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.685
- Actually, before
Dad left for work,

09:13.687 --> 09:15.220
I borrowed
his "approval" stamp.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.755
We can get
anything we want.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.024
All we have to do
is stamp it with this.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.625
- Max, how could you--

09:20.627 --> 09:23.762
not tell me that
you had this?

09:25.599 --> 09:28.199
[clears throat]
Two milkshakes, please.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.039
[voice quivering]
It's almost too much power.

09:34.041 --> 09:38.009
- Don't worry, Phoebs.
We'll use it responsibly.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.011
- [jet engines roaring]

09:40.013 --> 09:42.714
- That's my million
dollar rocket shark!

09:42.716 --> 09:44.215
Ah!

09:47.688 --> 09:49.588
[gasping]

09:50.257 --> 09:52.123
I love you, rocket shark.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.692
You're perfect!

09:53.694 --> 09:56.161
- I knew he'd find
a new girlfriend.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.130
- I already like her
more than Allison.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.666
- Max, take me on a ride.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.234
I wanna go
somewhere exotic--

10:03.236 --> 10:05.003
like the moon
or Bruno Mars.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.605
- No, way.
I get to go, first!

10:06.607 --> 10:08.873
- No, me, first!
- [lasers zapping]

10:08.875 --> 10:11.042
- BILLY:
Okay, you first.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.979
- Nora, you just
lasered Billy.

10:13.981 --> 10:14.879
- Yeah, it's my thing.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.816
- Well, our thing is
protecting the First Family--

10:17.818 --> 10:18.950
even from each other.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.287
From now on, you have
to stay ten feet apart,

10:22.289 --> 10:23.555
at all times.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.289
- If this involves math,

10:24.291 --> 10:26.591
you should probably
talk to Nora.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.861
- Billy, he's saying
we can't play together.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.030
- This is why
I hate math!

10:32.766 --> 10:35.867
- Whoa, Billy and Nora aren't
allowed to play with each other?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.236
- Well, maybe some time apart
will be good for them.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.105
- Hm, make them learn
to be more independent?

10:40.107 --> 10:42.007
- No, until Billy's laser
burns can heal.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.142
Anyway, I'm gonna take
the rocket shark to Australia.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.044
- Well, Cherry and I
are gonna take

10:46.046 --> 10:47.846
Dad's approval
stamp for a spin.

10:47.848 --> 10:48.980
Uh, assistant,
do we have time

10:48.982 --> 10:50.649
for a little
shopping in Milan?

10:50.651 --> 10:53.752
- I've already filled
out the request form.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.789
- You just put giant
cherries on all your paperwork?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.991
- It's gotten me this far.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.995
- [engine revving]

11:05.632 --> 11:08.733
- [rockets firing]

11:11.271 --> 11:14.739
- Max's new girlfriend
is very rude.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.077
- Domo arigato,
SuperAmbassador.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.712
I'll see you at
the summit, SuperSenator.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.082
I look forward to high tea,
SuperQueen of England.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.852
- Hank, here's your
presidential schedule.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.254
- [groaning]
It's gonna be a busy year.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.623
- And that's just
for this morning.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.159
- I'm too busy dealing with
the cake-eating investigation

11:34.161 --> 11:37.896
that I've called for and also
am the subject of.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.266
- Sir, I have an update
on the investigation,

11:41.268 --> 11:43.034
and, frankly,
I'm disappointed.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.602
- Oh, no,
this is it, Barb.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.006
- All of our evidence
points to it being...

11:48.008 --> 11:49.908
a wild animal.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.643
- [laughing]
Really?

11:51.645 --> 11:52.677
Why do you think that?

11:52.679 --> 11:56.381
- Only a rabid beast could
eat that cake so thoroughly.

11:56.383 --> 11:56.948
- Oh.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.818
- Where was a lot of hair
and saliva and claw marks--

11:59.820 --> 12:01.152
- Okay, okay, okay.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.955
Thank you, uh,
for the update.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.857
- Oh...
- Oh...

12:05.859 --> 12:07.058
- That was close.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.695
- I wanna celebrate,
but I still wish we hadn't lied.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.664
- Me, too, but
we avoided a scandal

12:12.666 --> 12:15.700
and no one will
ever find out.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.135
- [cell phone bings]

12:17.137 --> 12:18.103
- Unless an unknown
stranger

12:18.105 --> 12:20.872
sends a video
of you eating the cake.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.207
- Oh, come on!

12:22.209 --> 12:24.109
- "If you don't
meet my demands,

12:24.111 --> 12:26.911
I'll release this video
to the press."

12:26.913 --> 12:31.182
- [chomping, laughing,
garbled speech]

12:32.352 --> 12:34.719
- Did you get some
in your ear?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.721
- It was everywhere, Barb.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.423
Everywhere.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.228
- ¶

12:43.230 --> 12:45.363
- Gidday, Thundermates.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.198
- Oh, my gosh,
you would not believe

12:47.200 --> 12:49.267
what Cherry and I
did in Milan.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.702
- Shopping?

12:50.704 --> 12:52.270
- Okay, yes.

12:53.707 --> 12:54.439
Nora, what're you doin'?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.840
- Just playing
checkers by myself

12:55.842 --> 12:57.742
because I'm not
allowed to play with Billy.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.878
[whispering]
Watch this.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.980
[clears throat]

13:01.982 --> 13:03.715
- BILLY:
[zooming]

13:03.717 --> 13:05.416
- Oh, that's pretty
brilliant.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.184
- [zooming]
Yeah.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.887
They'll never catch us,
if I don't stand here too long.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.155
- They're playing
together!

13:10.157 --> 13:12.123
Code Red! Code Red!

13:15.729 --> 13:17.295
- What are you
guys putting on them?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.063
- Necklaces that will
zap them with electricity,

13:19.065 --> 13:21.166
if they get within
ten feet of each other.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.935
The closer they get,
the bigger the blast.

13:23.937 --> 13:24.569
- Is this a joke?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.472
- [electrical zapping]
- NORA & BILLY: Ow!

13:27.474 --> 13:29.908
- The joke hurts.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.142
- This isn't fair.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.410
- You know what
isn't fair?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.813
I still live
with my mother.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.448
- You can have
our bedroom, Nora.

13:37.450 --> 13:40.118
I'll sleep in
the bathtub.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.988
- Oh, this isn't good.
- Yeah.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.958
Now I've gotta walk
all the way upstairs

13:46.960 --> 13:49.427
to use the bathroom.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.763
- What's wrong, Chloe?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.032
- Mommy's too busy
to do story time,

13:54.034 --> 13:57.035
so, I'm stuck
with this guy.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.170
- "Then, Super
Little Bear said,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.973
'Somebody's been
eating my porridge.'"

14:01.975 --> 14:03.441
Okay, bears don't
eat porridge,

14:03.443 --> 14:06.444
and they certainly
don't sleep in beds.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.848
- He's killin'
the magic!

14:14.087 --> 14:15.153
- [groans]
Max...

14:15.155 --> 14:16.754
all this bad stuff
is happening

14:16.756 --> 14:18.323
because we made
Dad president.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.924
- True, but let's
not ignore

14:19.926 --> 14:21.392
all the good stuff
that's also happening,

14:21.394 --> 14:23.361
like I got
the rocket shark,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.463
and you're payin' Cherry
to hang out with you.

14:25.465 --> 14:29.033
- Hey, it's not a job,
if you're doing what you love.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.035
The point is our
whole family's lives

14:31.037 --> 14:32.871
are being destroyed
because of us.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.839
- I wouldn't
say our whole family.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.241
Dad loves being
president.

14:36.243 --> 14:40.211
- HANK:
[muffled sobbing]

14:40.213 --> 14:42.046
- Do you hear crying?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.848
- HANK: [sobbing]
I'm president...

14:43.850 --> 14:46.551
[sobbing]

14:48.154 --> 14:49.954
Oh, hello.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.224
- Dad...

14:53.226 --> 14:55.226
are you cryin'
in my lair slide?

14:55.228 --> 14:58.830
- Kids, being president's
making me do things

14:58.832 --> 14:59.964
I wouldn't normally do.

14:59.966 --> 15:02.200
But I made the decision
to be president,

15:02.202 --> 15:04.869
so, here we are.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.305
Close me up, children.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.242
- No matter how far I go
in that rocket shark,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.944
I will never
escape the memory

15:12.946 --> 15:14.445
of that blubbering
man-child.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.381
- We have to fix
our family.

15:16.383 --> 15:20.118
- HANK: Why me?!
[sobbing]

15:20.120 --> 15:21.152
- Fast!

15:21.154 --> 15:23.354
This all started because
we made Kickbutt quit.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.122
Maybe we can find her

15:24.124 --> 15:25.523
and convince her to
take her job back.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.293
- Good idea.
Let's go find Kickbutt.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.462
- Sorry, kids, but Former
President Kickbutt

15:31.464 --> 15:32.964
doesn't want
you to find her.

15:32.966 --> 15:36.267
I am authorized to use
Painful Force to stop you.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.137
Painful Force,
get in here!

15:39.139 --> 15:41.139
- Hello, friends.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.474
- You're the guy that's
gonna stop people?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.009
- Please,
don't be afraid.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.611
I know I'm
very intimidating.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.113
- There's no way
you're gonna stop us

15:49.115 --> 15:50.214
from getting Kickbutt.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.416
- Yeah, so,
get outta the way,

15:51.418 --> 15:53.084
unless you want
the kick of the butt

15:53.086 --> 15:56.187
to be your butt
gettin' kicked...

15:56.189 --> 15:57.922
by us.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.424
- Phoebe,
freeze breath!

15:59.426 --> 16:00.358
- PHOEBE & MAX:
Ow!

16:00.360 --> 16:03.027
- If you try to use
your powers against me,

16:03.029 --> 16:05.096
you'll feel
a painful force.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.031
So, you guys will stay?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.032
- Yeah, sure.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.168
After I use
my heat breath!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.070
Ow!

16:12.072 --> 16:15.039
- Heh, heh, what he's
trying to say is...

16:15.041 --> 16:16.941
we'll stay.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.779
- ¶

16:21.781 --> 16:23.781
- All right, so,
in order to find Kickbutt,

16:23.783 --> 16:24.482
and save our family,

16:24.484 --> 16:27.051
we have to get past
this Painful Force person.

16:27.053 --> 16:27.585
Any ideas?

16:27.587 --> 16:29.320
- We may not be able
to use our powers,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.422
but we can use
these bad boys.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.357
[chuckling]

16:32.359 --> 16:36.160
- Oh, yeah, we'll knock him
out with your stinky pits.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.930
- Does anyone know
if I can wear

16:38.932 --> 16:41.766
this shock necklace
in the bathtub?

16:42.802 --> 16:43.368
- That's it!

16:43.370 --> 16:46.504
We're gonna give this guy
the shock of his life.

16:47.073 --> 16:50.475
- Hi, Painful Force, I see
you do Sudoku puzzles.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.945
- I like to tease
the brain.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.046
- Billy, go!

16:55.048 --> 16:56.180
- BILLY:
[zooming]

16:56.182 --> 16:57.782
- [electrical zapping]

16:57.784 --> 16:59.384
- [heavy thud]

17:00.286 --> 17:02.253
- BILLY & NORA: [weakly]
We did it.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.254
- Are you guys okay?

17:03.256 --> 17:05.857
- BILLY & NORA: [weakly]
We did it.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.559
- They're good!
To the rocket shark!

17:10.163 --> 17:12.497
- Hank, come on out.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.533
I know you're in
your cry spot.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.203
- [sniffles]
I'm not crying.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.273
I just got some slide
dust in my eye.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.474
- I just got another text.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.144
The person who has the video
of you eating the cake

17:26.146 --> 17:27.879
said to meet him
in the lair.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.414
- It could be
anybody, Barb.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.548
- Like Colosso?

17:30.550 --> 17:34.052
- Nah, he's not smart
enough to pull this off.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.321
- I'm the blackmailer,
you jerks!

17:37.891 --> 17:39.190
- What do you
want, rabbit?

17:39.192 --> 17:42.960
- To be the Hero League's
Secretary of Fashion.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.830
I wanna outlaw dad khakis
and yoga pants.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.999
- But that's
everything we wear!

17:48.001 --> 17:50.168
- Do as I say,
or the world gets to see

17:50.170 --> 17:52.470
you stuff your face
with history.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.473
- I am not making you
Secretary of Fashion,

17:55.475 --> 17:57.542
even if it means I tarnish
the Thunderman name,

17:57.544 --> 18:00.178
and get kicked out
of office in disgrace!

18:00.180 --> 18:01.446
Oh, I can't
do it, Barb!

18:01.448 --> 18:05.116
- Just give him what he wants!
We're in too deep!

18:05.118 --> 18:08.853
- HANK: [sobbing]
- COLOSSO: [evil laugh]

18:09.255 --> 18:12.457
- [easy listening
music playing]

18:12.459 --> 18:15.059
- Okay, the rocket shark
ran a global search

18:15.061 --> 18:16.894
and said that
Kickbutt's here.

18:16.896 --> 18:17.628
- What is this place?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.464
- Welcome to
Kickbutt Travel,

18:19.466 --> 18:21.265
where your
happiness is--oh.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.201
You found me.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.469
- Uh, can we chat?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.104
- I don't have
time for this.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.040
I run a travel business now
for non-flying supes.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.075
- Hi, here's my
ticket to Aruba.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.343
- Ah, the Astonishing
Beach Bum.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.479
It looks like you're
about to depart.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.048
Thanks for flying
the Kickbutt skies.

18:37.050 --> 18:40.318
[kicks butt]
- Yaho-o-o-o-o!

18:40.320 --> 18:42.386
- Whoa!
- Cool!

18:42.388 --> 18:45.323
- Uh, how do
people get home?

18:45.325 --> 18:48.025
- Well, that's
their problem.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.227
- Kickbutt, we need
to talk to you.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.129
- Please, please, please
be president again.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.364
- Oh, first you tell me
I'm not doing my job.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.434
Now you're begging me
to go back to it?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.268
- We're sorry.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.536
You were a really
great president,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.571
and we never should
have wasted your time

19:00.573 --> 19:01.339
calling you every day.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.673
- Yeah, we realize
we were just being selfish,

19:02.675 --> 19:05.042
and if you would just
come back as president,

19:05.044 --> 19:06.210
we promise to stop
calling you.

19:06.212 --> 19:10.014
- Except to see how things
are going with Colosso.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.050
- So...

19:13.052 --> 19:13.951
what do you say?

19:13.953 --> 19:16.354
- Look,
the Northern Lights!

19:16.356 --> 19:18.189
- It sounded like
you said--

19:18.191 --> 19:20.291
Ahhhhh!

19:20.460 --> 19:23.227
- Ah, you don't need
to kick my butt home.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.529
I've got
the rocket shark.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.131
- You got
the rocket shark?

19:27.133 --> 19:29.133
[roars]
- Ahhhh!

19:30.470 --> 19:31.702
- Ahhhhh!

19:31.704 --> 19:33.304
Oh!

19:34.040 --> 19:34.972
- Ahhhh!

19:34.974 --> 19:36.007
- [heavy thud]

19:36.009 --> 19:38.176
- BOTH:
[grunting]

19:39.212 --> 19:41.712
- Well, that flight
was terrible.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.718
- What's going on?
- Better hurry in and find out.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.620
- BOTH:
Ow! Ooh!

19:49.622 --> 19:53.324
- [mixed conversations]

19:53.326 --> 19:54.692
- PHOEBE:
Whew.

19:54.694 --> 19:59.397
- Uh, who are all these
goobers in our living room?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.164
- Yeah, what's going on?

20:00.166 --> 20:02.433
- Mom and Dad are having
a press conference.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.201
- Hey, Hank, Barb,

20:03.203 --> 20:06.504
I'm real excited about being
the Secretary of Fashion.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.106
But I also
want something bigger.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.041
- Like what?

20:10.043 --> 20:12.677
- The Statue of Colosso.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.546
- What does that
statue have to do with

20:15.548 --> 20:18.216
you being
Secretary of Fashion?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.284
- Nothing.
I just want it.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.219
And if I don't get it,

20:21.221 --> 20:24.689
I'll release that video,
President CakeButt.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.325
- Are you ever gonna
stop making demands?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.426
- Are you ever
gonna stop

20:28.428 --> 20:30.361
stuffing random cakes
in your mouth?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.996
I'll answer both.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.331
No!

20:35.702 --> 20:38.069
- Can I have
your attention.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.138
I came here to make
a special announcement

20:41.140 --> 20:43.174
regarding Dr. Colosso.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.376
- ¶ Here it comes ¶

20:45.378 --> 20:47.678
- Instead, I am
going to say that

20:47.680 --> 20:50.548
I am the one
who ate the cake.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.449
- COLOSSO:
Huh?

20:51.451 --> 20:52.717
- CROWD:
[mixed conversations]

20:52.719 --> 20:55.353
- Is this seriously
a shock to people?

20:55.355 --> 20:58.522
- I'm sorry, everyone.
I know I let you down.

20:58.524 --> 21:04.061
But being president
is really, really hard.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.764
- I could have
told you that!

21:06.766 --> 21:07.465
- Kickbutt's back!

21:07.467 --> 21:10.134
- Our eloquent plea
touched your heart.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.469
- Not even close.

21:11.471 --> 21:16.207
The Liaison told me Hank
was crying like a big baby--

21:16.209 --> 21:18.075
on a slide.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.344
His words, not mine.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.813
- I said it
and I own it.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.650
- I knew I had to come
back to be president--

21:25.652 --> 21:29.153
that is, if Hank is willing
to step down.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.388
- Yes! I step down!

21:30.390 --> 21:32.657
Oh, it's over, honey.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.725
- It's over, baby.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.465
- Billy, we can hang
out with each other again.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.567
- How about we go play
our favorite game?

21:43.569 --> 21:45.303
- Sure.
[lasers zapping]

21:45.305 --> 21:47.805
- Ow! I meant checkers.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.108
- And now we'll reinstate
President Kickbutt

21:51.110 --> 21:54.845
with the traditional
reinstatement cake.

21:54.847 --> 21:59.183
Oh, my gosh!
Somebody ate this cake, too!

21:59.185 --> 22:00.117
- It wasn't me.

22:00.119 --> 22:04.322
- [whooshing]
It wasn't me either, baby!

22:04.324 --> 22:07.558
- ¶

22:10.263 --> 22:26.510
- ¶
