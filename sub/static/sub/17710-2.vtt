00:36.240 --> 00:41.760
There are only a dozen peaks in the world that rise five miles high.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.760
All of them are here, in the Himalayas.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.600
Lethally cold, scoured by gales and blizzards,

01:07.600 --> 01:12.400
these mountains are among the most hostile places on Earth.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.080
Yet, a few special animals manage to live here.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.520
Snow leopards.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.200
Like all creatures of the high mountains,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.800
they have had to adapt both their body and their behaviour

01:42.800 --> 01:44.560
in order to survive.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.840
Life at extreme altitude

01:54.840 --> 01:59.040
has shaped some of the toughest animals on the planet.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.400
LEOPARD ROARS

02:21.040 --> 02:24.440
The sunbaked mountains of the Arabian Peninsula.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.680
They may only be a fraction of the height of the Himalayas,

02:32.680 --> 02:36.600
but they are still so dizzyingly steep

02:36.600 --> 02:41.080
that in many places it's almost impossible to get a foothold.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.800
Yet Nubian ibex have made this their home.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.160
BIRD CALLS

03:05.280 --> 03:09.920
The ibex choose the steepest cliffs to raise their young,

03:09.920 --> 03:13.440
in safety, beyond the reach of predators.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.720
But living in this sanctuary comes with a cost.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.000
These nursery slopes are so steep,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.960
there is almost no standing water up here.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.480
So to drink, an ibex family must descend into the valley...

03:52.520 --> 03:54.800
..1,000 feet below.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.000
The mothers pick out the safest way down.

04:02.080 --> 04:06.280
With soft cloven hooves that grip better than any climbing shoe,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.160
they are the most accomplished mountaineers.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.800
But the newborn kids are still having to find their feet.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.920
This is their first descent.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.040
One mistake could make it their last.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.960
Following the adults, the kids finally reach the valley.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.640
But once on level ground, they're vulnerable.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.840
Red foxes lie in wait.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.360
At the first sign of danger,

05:36.360 --> 05:40.160
the young ibex instinctively run back to steeper ground.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.920
KID BLEATS

05:53.720 --> 05:57.560
But heading for this particular rocky outcrop could be a mistake.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.280
It's a 30-foot drop.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.240
The fox has them trapped -

06:06.240 --> 06:07.760
or so it seems.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.120
This is what ibex were born to do.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.160
Scattering makes it hard for the fox to pick a target.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.040
And it certainly can't follow them up here.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.160
All it can do is wait for one to slip and fall.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.840
But these youngsters are fast learners,

07:34.840 --> 07:38.240
and they're now almost as sure-footed as their parents.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
The fox will have to find its meal elsewhere.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.840
It's just not been a good day.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.640
Now, at last, the young ibex can drink.

08:39.600 --> 08:43.600
But they'll soon need to return to the safety of the sheer cliffs.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.640
Mastering precipitous terrain is always challenging,

08:53.640 --> 08:57.680
but there are more fundamental problems for life in the mountains.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.840
The Alps. Europe's highest peaks.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.800
It's winter, and food is desperately short.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.840
A golden eagle has to spend every daylight hour

09:38.840 --> 09:43.720
scanning the slopes for something, somewhere, to eat.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.200
Her seven-foot wingspan allows her to glide effortlessly

09:57.200 --> 10:00.200
for 100 miles in a single day.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.040
Her extraordinary eyes enable her to spot prey from two miles away.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.760
But she is not the only one who's looking for food.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.720
When she spots a chance, she must move fast.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.720
She can dive at 200 miles an hour.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.720
Only a peregrine is faster.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.880
During winter, even eagles rely almost entirely on carrion.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.160
It's a dead fox, and it could sustain her for days.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.680
Other scavengers must defer.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.480
The hungry crows soon regain their courage.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.520
They'll try any trick to steal a morsel.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.320
And they are annoyingly persistent.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.480
But this mob are the least of her worries.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.920
A bigger eagle takes control.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.800
But this kill is too important to give up.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.760
So she must fight.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.880
For the moment, she's won the carcass back.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.960
But a kill like this will attract every eagle for miles around.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.080
As ever, the strongest wins the lion's share.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.040
Unable to defend the carcass any longer,

13:40.040 --> 13:42.920
the first eagle must now continue its search.

13:44.880 --> 13:47.640
It may be many days before she feeds again.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.360
Only the most competitive

13:54.360 --> 13:57.160
will survive the perils of the mountain winter.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.280
RUMBLING

14:26.360 --> 14:28.040
An avalanche.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.960
100,000 tonnes of snow

14:29.960 --> 14:32.640
travelling at 80 miles an hour,

14:32.640 --> 14:35.960
capable of smashing everything in its path.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.320
The mountains of North America

15:16.320 --> 15:20.120
are hit by thousands of avalanches every year.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.640
Yet one animal spends the whole winter

15:36.640 --> 15:40.960
slumbering within the snow on these avalanche-prone slopes.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.360
And when spring comes, they emerge.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.480
All across these mountains,

16:09.480 --> 16:12.600
grizzly bears make their winter dens

16:12.600 --> 16:16.280
10,000 feet up in the deep snow of leeward slopes.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.640
And while they were half-asleep in the depths of winter,

16:21.640 --> 16:23.200
their young were born.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.840
Now these cubs are taking their first steps into the outside world.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.520
This mother is leading her three youngsters

16:58.520 --> 17:01.400
to a place where they can find food.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.800
RUMBLING

17:06.800 --> 17:10.000
They need to descend as quickly as possible.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.359
The debris from an avalanche

17:14.359 --> 17:18.440
is clear evidence that this slope is still dangerously unstable.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.200
This is not a place to dawdle.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.800
And they have another reason to keep moving.

17:43.560 --> 17:47.760
After five months in the den, these bears are very hungry.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.480
Bears that have hibernated throughout these peaks

17:56.480 --> 18:00.720
now all descend to the valleys, where spring comes earliest.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.920
In the Rockies, seasonal change is swift and dramatic.

18:23.520 --> 18:29.000
In just a few days, the slopes turn from white to green.

18:50.520 --> 18:55.280
Meadows that only a few weeks ago were buried beneath the snow

18:55.280 --> 18:57.440
are now full of life.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.680
But in these mountains, the good times will not last long.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.880
So the bears must feed as fast as they can.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.760
During the summer months,

19:29.760 --> 19:34.000
an adult can put on 180 kilos gorging on plants

19:34.000 --> 19:36.400
and, if they can catch them...

19:36.400 --> 19:39.440
MARMOT CALLS ..a marmot or two.

19:43.520 --> 19:47.640
But just now, the bears have something else on their minds.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.120
It's becoming warmer,

19:53.120 --> 19:56.360
and the bears are keen to shed their thick winter coats.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.760
Mothers show the cubs what to do about this.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.240
They'll soon catch on.

20:17.560 --> 20:21.400
Some trees, it seems, are particularly suitable for rubbing.

20:22.720 --> 20:27.320
Bears have their favourites and will travel long distances to visit them.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.200
Some itches just have to be scratched.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.320
There are now around 30 bears in this one valley.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.800
As they rub, each leaves an individual and recognisable scent.

21:13.680 --> 21:18.120
So the tree soon carries a list of who's around,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.800
which might help individuals to avoid a fight.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.000
To best spread their scent,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.880
they really have to put their back into it.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.680
BEAR GRUNTS

22:09.480 --> 22:11.720
But summer is short.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.760
Itches satisfactorily scratched,

22:14.760 --> 22:16.840
it's time to eat.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.760
In a couple of months,

22:21.760 --> 22:24.800
they will have to return to their dens to hibernate,

22:24.800 --> 22:27.600
so now they must put on as much weight as they can.

22:34.920 --> 22:39.200
Winter in the mountains returns fast and hits hard.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.280
WIND HOWLS

22:53.760 --> 22:58.960
Temperatures in the Rockies will drop to -54 degrees,

22:58.960 --> 23:01.560
so cold that moisture in the air

23:01.560 --> 23:06.120
freezes into tiny crystals called diamond dust.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.200
This bobcat is one of the few hunters to remain active in winter.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.560
Most of his prey is now hidden beneath the snow

23:40.560 --> 23:43.200
that covers his entire territory.

23:48.920 --> 23:53.680
He hunts by listening for the faintest sound of movement.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.640
And to prevent crunching footsteps from revealing his presence,

23:57.640 --> 24:00.800
he uses boulders as stepping stones.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.560
A mouse.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.960
But one is not enough.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.360
The deeper the snow, the harder it is to detect prey,

24:45.360 --> 24:48.320
and the rewards for the effort can be disappointing.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.760
To say the least.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.440
By midwinter, the snow is so deep

25:00.440 --> 25:03.600
that bobcats are forced to leave their territories

25:03.600 --> 25:06.000
to try and find easier hunting.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.960
And this bobcat may be in luck.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.240
For this particular valley is blessed.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.880
A river here never freezes.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.840
It's fed by a volcanic hot spring

25:50.840 --> 25:52.480
that heats these waters

25:52.480 --> 25:55.720
to 50 degrees warmer than the surrounding air.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.920
Hungry animals of all kinds come here to feed.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.600
Throughout the winter,

26:30.600 --> 26:32.080
the river is full of food

26:32.080 --> 26:34.800
for those who know how to catch it.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.240
Here, even the coyotes have become fishermen.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.520
But hunting is hard for a cat that's not used to getting its feet wet.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.400
So he must choose his target with care.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.440
Goldeneye ducks.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.400
But can he get close enough to pounce?

27:51.120 --> 27:53.400
QUACKING

27:58.920 --> 28:01.920
Perhaps he'll have more luck on the other side.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.840
Here, steam from the river warms the surrounding trees,

28:22.840 --> 28:26.560
so up in the branches, there could be prey.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.360
CHIRPING

28:32.200 --> 28:34.160
If only he could get to it.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.480
It's 20 feet up.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.360
At last - a squirrel.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.680
Not much, but enough to keep him going.

29:04.880 --> 29:09.960
To survive a winter in these mountains takes tenacity,

29:09.960 --> 29:13.040
and bobcats have that in abundance.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.520
Snow on the equator.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.800
Unlike the Rockies, in these mountains

29:36.800 --> 29:38.760
there are no marked seasons.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.520
This is Africa's Mount Kenya.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.360
It's 17,000 feet high,

29:57.360 --> 30:00.160
which makes its summit some 30 degrees colder

30:00.160 --> 30:02.600
than the surrounding savanna.

30:06.680 --> 30:13.160
Giant heathers, lobelias and groundsel grow on its upper slopes.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.560
They all thrive in the tropical sun.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.360
After all, every day is summer.

30:21.880 --> 30:28.160
But once the sun sets, every night becomes as bitterly cold as winter.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.320
The temperature drops to five degrees below freezing,

30:40.320 --> 30:44.240
turning the mountainside into a garden of ice.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.640
CRACKLING

31:04.720 --> 31:06.760
Everything freezes,

31:06.760 --> 31:11.680
but the cabbage groundsels have a way of protecting themselves.

31:17.680 --> 31:22.280
They close up their leathery leaves to form an insulating blanket

31:22.280 --> 31:25.200
that shields their vulnerable central bud.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.680
Night comes to an end...

31:42.720 --> 31:44.600
..and the sunshine returns.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.280
The groundsels spread their leaves wide

31:52.280 --> 31:54.440
to bask in the sunshine once again.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.800
Dawn in the High Andes.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.440
Here too, the rising sun brings rapid relief

32:28.440 --> 32:31.760
to animals living amongst these volcanic peaks.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.480
Mountain viscacha are up early

32:38.480 --> 32:42.480
to claim the best places to catch the sun's first rays.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.880
For others up here, the sunrise is even more welcome.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
At over 14,000 feet,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.360
this is the highest flamingo colony in the world.

33:18.960 --> 33:23.640
At night, it gets so cold that even this salty water freezes over.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.960
And now the flamingos are trapped in the ice.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.120
FLAMINGOS CALL

33:34.520 --> 33:38.400
Eventually, the sun thins the ice,

33:38.400 --> 33:42.200
but it's still a struggle for the flamingos to break free.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.200
Walking on thin ice is always risky.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.000
And it's hard to retain one's dignity...

34:20.600 --> 34:22.679
..especially when you're wearing stilts.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.080
At these altitudes,

34:38.080 --> 34:43.280
the sun's power can quickly turn from salvation to threat.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.800
The atmosphere is so thin,

34:51.800 --> 34:55.320
there is very little protection from ultraviolet radiation.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.760
By mid-morning, it's risky to linger out in the open.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.200
The viscacha are forced to head for the shade.

35:12.160 --> 35:15.440
Out on the lake, there is nowhere to hide.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.960
The white crust of the soda lake

35:23.960 --> 35:26.000
reflects the sun's glare

35:26.000 --> 35:29.160
and increases the impact of its ultraviolet rays.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.600
By midday, uncovered human skin will burn in four minutes.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.280
But this doesn't seem to bother the flamingos.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.600
In fact, they are on parade.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.440
During the breeding season,

36:22.440 --> 36:26.000
the flamingos perform these peculiar courtship dances

36:26.000 --> 36:28.680
even through the hottest time of the day.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.520
They are so eager, they don't even pause to feed.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.600
The rules are something of a mystery

36:59.600 --> 37:01.640
but, after a month of dancing,

37:01.640 --> 37:03.960
all the birds will have paired off

37:03.960 --> 37:06.160
and will be getting ready to mate.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.880
Up here, there are few other creatures to bother the flamingos,

37:16.880 --> 37:18.840
but then, few other creatures

37:18.840 --> 37:21.440
could even tolerate these conditions.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.040
So for animals that have the endurance,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.720
mountains can be sanctuaries.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.240
But rocky peaks which to us, perhaps,

37:46.240 --> 37:48.680
seem a symbol of permanence,

37:48.680 --> 37:50.920
are more fragile than they appear.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.320
Today in the Alps,

37:57.320 --> 38:01.720
human encroachment is changing even the highest summits.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.600
In the Rockies,

38:16.600 --> 38:19.720
rising temperatures are shortening winter hibernation

38:19.720 --> 38:22.680
and stifling the growth of valuable food plants.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.240
And in the Andes, some glaciers

38:32.240 --> 38:36.080
have shrunk by 50% in just 30 years.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.480
Even the Himalayas are now vulnerable.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.320
With most of the world's tallest peaks

38:54.320 --> 38:57.840
and covering a third of a million square miles,

38:57.840 --> 39:00.320
this is the greatest mountain range of all.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.520
And here, temperatures are now rising

39:09.520 --> 39:11.560
faster than the global average.

39:13.040 --> 39:17.680
As the snow line retreats further and further up these peaks,

39:17.680 --> 39:21.280
there is less and less space for wildlife,

39:21.280 --> 39:23.040
and that is a challenge

39:23.040 --> 39:27.480
for one of the most majestic of all mountain creatures.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.680
The snow leopard.

39:51.080 --> 39:56.880
Seldom seen, the detail of their lives has long been a mystery,

39:56.880 --> 40:02.000
but now, at last, helped by the latest remote-camera technology,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.960
we are getting closer to them than ever before.

40:10.280 --> 40:14.440
They are very rare - only about four of them in 40 square miles.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.520
There is simply not enough prey to sustain more.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.920
They live solitary lives.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.400
Nonetheless, they are well aware of the presence and the movements of

40:31.400 --> 40:36.480
their neighbours, because they leave messages in a few special places.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.360
They rub particular rocks with their cheeks...

40:46.080 --> 40:48.560
..and then spray them with urine.

40:51.120 --> 40:54.680
The two perfumes create a unique signature.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.040
SQUIRTING

40:59.040 --> 41:04.080
Any other leopard can know which of its neighbours passed this way,

41:04.080 --> 41:06.560
without ever making direct contact.

41:10.080 --> 41:14.160
But there are times when snow leopards must come together,

41:14.160 --> 41:16.560
and the event is often violent.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.760
An adult female and her daughter.

41:42.200 --> 41:46.480
She has devoted the last two years to raising her cub

41:46.480 --> 41:48.680
and very soon, it will be weaned.

41:51.800 --> 41:55.800
For now, the cub is still entirely dependent on its mother.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.520
But staying together as long as this could cause problems.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.760
The female is now in heat again,

42:11.760 --> 42:15.520
and any male that smells her signature will know that.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.920
SQUIRTING

42:25.920 --> 42:29.520
From this moment on, her cub's life is at risk.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.160
Males kill cubs that are not their own.

42:40.640 --> 42:44.680
But the mother is now driven by an urge that she cannot control.

42:48.680 --> 42:52.360
She lets the males know exactly where she is.

42:52.360 --> 42:55.440
LEOPARD CALLS

43:05.360 --> 43:08.760
From up here, she can be heard for miles around.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.960
LEOPARD CALLS

43:27.880 --> 43:31.600
A young male emerges from the wilderness, eager to find her.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.080
Snow leopards meet so infrequently

43:38.080 --> 43:40.960
that there is uncertainty and tension.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.120
And it's about to get worse.

43:59.960 --> 44:02.480
Another, bigger male has arrived.

44:11.560 --> 44:15.120
The mother and cub are trapped between the rivals.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.960
GROWLING

44:20.480 --> 44:22.320
The cub is now in danger.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.960
Mother must act fast.

44:25.480 --> 44:28.400
To divert the males' attention from her cub,

44:28.400 --> 44:30.360
she rolls over submissively.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.280
With the males fixed on the female, the cub has a chance to escape.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.520
GROWLING

44:54.520 --> 44:57.360
The males close in on the mother from both sides,

44:57.360 --> 44:59.240
keen to claim her for their own.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.720
A fight is inevitable.

45:27.120 --> 45:30.080
The female moves to escape and protect her cub.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.440
But the big male follows her.

45:44.880 --> 45:48.400
He will not let her leave until he has mated with her.

46:05.840 --> 46:10.920
With the males gone, the female is at last reunited with her cub.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.400
But she has been injured.

46:26.560 --> 46:30.520
The cub, however, is alive, thanks to its mother.

46:40.200 --> 46:43.920
Until her injury heals, she won't be able to hunt.

46:47.040 --> 46:50.360
Mountain animals survive on the very edge of existence.

46:54.080 --> 46:57.000
Mother and cub were not seen again.

47:05.600 --> 47:09.280
Until over a month later, high on a ridge,

47:09.280 --> 47:11.160
a remote camera was triggered.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.400
The female cat.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.720
She's no longer limping, but she's now alone.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.360
Then, an hour after the female has left,

47:29.360 --> 47:31.640
the camera is triggered again.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.040
It's her cub,

47:40.040 --> 47:44.480
taking her first steps towards adulthood and independence.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.840
She is unlikely to see her mother again.

47:49.840 --> 47:53.040
But every now and then, they will be reunited

47:53.040 --> 47:57.240
through the messages they leave on the marking rocks.

48:00.480 --> 48:04.080
Her mother has succeeded in raising her,

48:04.080 --> 48:07.200
but life ahead will be challenging,

48:07.200 --> 48:10.040
and she will spend nearly all of it alone.

48:13.160 --> 48:16.240
Only the toughest can survive

48:16.240 --> 48:20.240
among the savage beauty of the world's highest mountains.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.120
Revealing a new perspective

48:37.120 --> 48:39.760
on the lives of golden eagles in the mountains

48:39.760 --> 48:42.000
would take two very different approaches.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.840
A traditional wildlife crew set out to film wild eagles

48:52.840 --> 48:55.760
closer than ever before.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.920
Whilst an aerial team aimed to capture the hunting flights

49:02.920 --> 49:05.120
of eagles high in the mountains.

49:12.480 --> 49:15.600
The helicopter crew soon have success in filming

49:15.600 --> 49:17.440
wild eagles high over the Alps,

49:17.440 --> 49:21.280
but there was one part of the story even they couldn't follow.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.960
Golden eagles can stoop at 200 miles an hour.

49:31.480 --> 49:35.280
To capture an eagle's-eye view of such a dramatic flight

49:35.280 --> 49:38.120
would take a more extreme approach.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.120
I'm Aaron Durogati and I'm a professional paraglider pilot.

49:49.120 --> 49:54.240
Aaron believes that to fly like a bird, he must think like one, too.

49:54.240 --> 49:57.520
It's a very special feeling to fly with eagles

49:57.520 --> 50:00.320
because I'm really looking how they are thermalling

50:00.320 --> 50:02.000
and where they go to soar.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.520
This helps me to become a better pilot,

50:04.520 --> 50:07.200
and I try to take inspiration from the nature.

50:07.200 --> 50:10.440
Wearing a specially designed helmet camera,

50:10.440 --> 50:14.240
Aaron's aim is to film the perspective of a diving eagle.

50:18.520 --> 50:21.040
But before he can jump off a mountain,

50:21.040 --> 50:22.840
first he needs to climb it.

50:25.360 --> 50:30.480
It's a tough 3,000m ascent for Aaron and his wingman, Armin,

50:30.480 --> 50:34.160
as director Emma Brennand waits for news in the valley below.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.800
The ascent is slowed by a series of dangerous crevasses.

50:46.240 --> 50:49.840
After a tricky climb, they finally reach their launch site.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.040
But the weather up here is unpredictable

50:56.040 --> 50:59.200
and a change in wind direction makes it impossible to take off.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.000
Aaron and Armin are forced to overnight in the summit shelter,

51:08.000 --> 51:12.920
and with the cold knocking out their comms, Emma is worrying.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.480
They're well-trained mountain guides,

51:15.480 --> 51:18.280
but it doesn't make it any easier to know that.

51:18.280 --> 51:22.200
I think it's going to be a fairly restless night for me as well.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.320
Whilst the paragliders prepare for a night on the mountain...

51:27.200 --> 51:29.960
..cameraman Barrie Britton is setting out early

51:29.960 --> 51:34.080
on a more cautious quest to film wild golden eagles from a hide.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.640
I've got to get everything set while it's still dark

51:42.640 --> 51:46.120
and the eagles can't see what we're up to.

51:46.120 --> 51:49.760
Or if they saw any movement around the hide, then they'd fly away

51:49.760 --> 51:52.040
and probably wouldn't come back for a few days.

51:52.040 --> 51:55.160
They're notoriously difficult birds to film.

51:56.520 --> 51:59.880
Even hide work is not entirely without risks.

52:01.240 --> 52:05.800
It's -20 outside. So this is a crucial part of the operation,

52:05.800 --> 52:08.960
making sure the fire works so we don't freeze to death.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.520
Aah! Well, that's all the hairs gone on my hand!

52:11.520 --> 52:13.400
Oh, well!

52:13.400 --> 52:16.440
And we just have to be really quiet now

52:16.440 --> 52:20.040
and hope the eagles come in when first light comes up.

52:20.040 --> 52:22.840
Eight sedentary hours later,

52:22.840 --> 52:26.280
Barry's only reward is a dead leg.

52:28.360 --> 52:30.440
We haven't done a single shot today.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.520
Nothing has come.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.800
Anyway, that's the way it goes.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.600
After a long night on top of the mountain,

52:40.600 --> 52:43.040
the weather is only getting worse.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.360
The team need to get down, but visibility's so poor

52:46.360 --> 52:50.280
that descending on foot past the crevasses is too risky.

52:50.280 --> 52:55.040
Aaron decides it's safer to fly, but it'll be a bumpy ride.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.320
TRANSLATION:

53:12.160 --> 53:15.960
Thick cloud makes it hard to avoid the mountains, let alone film them.

53:18.520 --> 53:23.640
Thankfully, they make it down in one piece, much to Emma's relief.

53:23.640 --> 53:26.080
We are very, very glad to see you both.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.560
Yeah, it's a bit hard up there.

53:28.720 --> 53:32.840
The team spend the next two weeks chasing weather windows...

53:34.640 --> 53:37.000
..until at last, a clear flight.

53:52.040 --> 53:54.320
Trying to mimic a diving eagle,

53:54.320 --> 53:56.400
the flying looks spectacular,

53:56.400 --> 53:58.880
but the helmet-cam shots are less so.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.520
To stay safe at these speeds,

54:03.520 --> 54:06.800
Aaron must turn his head regularly to check his glider,

54:06.800 --> 54:09.200
and that is making the shots unusable.

54:13.080 --> 54:16.360
The team must quickly come up with a new plan.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.120
Back in the hide, all has been quiet

54:24.120 --> 54:27.600
until Barrie spots an eagle scavenging on a fox carcass.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.400
Barrie repositions his hide to keep watch.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.440
Good stuff!

54:48.480 --> 54:50.920
After 100 hours in the hide,

54:50.920 --> 54:53.480
finally, his luck changes.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.760
That's one terrifying bird there.

54:58.760 --> 55:02.280
For me, it's fantastic just to see them so close.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.880
It's just beautiful.

55:07.680 --> 55:11.840
With Barrie's success, it's now down to the paragliding team.

55:11.840 --> 55:15.360
They've come to the Mont Blanc range with a new plan.

55:17.280 --> 55:21.600
Aaron's decided that the best way to keep safe and get stable shots

55:21.600 --> 55:24.000
is to fly tandem with a cameraman.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.240
We've got to try and mimic how an eagle flies,

55:29.240 --> 55:32.960
which is pretty hard because they're basically like the top bird of prey.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.880
John is nervous.

55:34.880 --> 55:36.800
It's his first-ever flight.

55:38.720 --> 55:41.120
Three, two, one, go.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.560
Eee...ahh!

55:45.640 --> 55:48.880
Yes! Woohoo!

55:51.720 --> 55:55.200
- How is it? 
- Ah, man, that was a shock.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.480
Overcoming his initial fears, John begins filming.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.880
If you can go right of this, that'd be cool.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.200
The tandem wing allows John to get the shots

56:07.200 --> 56:09.520
that Aaron was unable to get flying solo.

56:11.080 --> 56:13.640
Awesome, Aaron, very good.

56:13.640 --> 56:15.720
But it's not all plain sailing.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.120
The feeling of discomfort only gets worse

56:23.120 --> 56:26.080
as Aaron begins the eagle dive.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.200
JOHN LAUGHS

56:34.200 --> 56:36.080
I feel sick!

56:37.600 --> 56:39.840
Oh, man!

56:39.840 --> 56:42.120
Flying low and fast like an eagle

56:42.120 --> 56:43.960
leaves little room for error.

56:54.360 --> 56:59.040
- LAUGHING: 
- A little bit too much, do you think? 
- Yeah!

56:59.040 --> 57:02.440
- Sorry, what did you call it, an unplanned landing? 
- Yeah!

57:04.520 --> 57:07.840
They might not be as majestic as a golden eagle,

57:07.840 --> 57:11.000
but they do capture a unique perspective

57:11.000 --> 57:14.520
that conveys an eagle's life as never before.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.200
Next time...

57:21.200 --> 57:23.320
we explore the world's jungles.

57:25.640 --> 57:29.800
Places of surprise and invention unrivalled on Earth...

57:31.680 --> 57:35.120
..where the battle for survival is at its most intense.
