WEBVTT

00:05.093 --> 00:07.179
<i>Gwen kisses me,
and I just stand there?</i>

00:07.346 --> 00:08.388
<i>What's with that?</i>

00:08.555 --> 00:12.267
<i>I mean, I battle super-beds daily,
but can't handle</i> a <i>little kiss?</i>

00:12.434 --> 00:14.520
<i>Even Black Cat
didn't induce paralysis.</i>

00:17.022 --> 00:19.399
<i>Does that mean Gwen's the one?</i>

00:19.566 --> 00:21.777
<i>I know Venom thought so, but--</i>

00:23.487 --> 00:24.905
Miss us?

00:25.072 --> 00:26.782
Venom. But l...

00:31.411 --> 00:34.456
Come on, bro, join us.

00:36.041 --> 00:38.627
You know you want to.

00:38.794 --> 00:40.462
No.

00:43.757 --> 00:45.634
No!

02:04.129 --> 02:06.006
<i>So it was only a nightmare.</i>

02:06.715 --> 02:08.383
<i>Still...</i>

02:08.550 --> 02:12.012
<i>...looks like Eddie grabbed everything
but his roommate and bailed.</i>

02:12.804 --> 02:16.808
<i>So, bro, where are you?</i>

02:20.604 --> 02:22.439
<i>Oh, perfect.</i>

02:22.606 --> 02:24.816
<i>These long johns keep the knees
from knocking...</i>

02:24.983 --> 02:28.195
<i>...but they also make me look
like the spectacular Spider-Mush.</i>

02:28.362 --> 02:31.448
<i>That's what I get for designing
my Spidey-suit in the spring.</i>

02:31.615 --> 02:34.493
<i>Fun in the sun,
not so much in the snow.</i>

02:34.660 --> 02:38.747
<i>Now I'll have to buy a pair
of those expensive skintight thermals.</i>

02:38.914 --> 02:41.249
<i>Add that to my to-do list.</i>

02:42.876 --> 02:43.919
<i>Okay so that's:</i>

02:44.086 --> 02:46.296
<i>One, talk to Gwen. Two, find Eddie.</i>

02:46.463 --> 02:50.008
<i>Three, write Harry.
Four, buy thermals.</i>

02:50.175 --> 02:54.262
<i>Oh, and five,
take care of Aunt</i> May.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.016
Aunt May, you're supposed
to be recuperating from a heart attack.

02:58.183 --> 02:59.851
I can still make pancakes.

03:00.018 --> 03:02.938
No, no, no. I will do the cooking.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.487
Peter...

03:10.654 --> 03:13.615
...I'm not sure my heart can take
watching you cook.

03:15.575 --> 03:18.370
<i>Okay, number one, talk to Gwen.</i>

03:18.537 --> 03:20.414
He's just a little confused.

03:21.498 --> 03:22.958
Hi.

03:26.837 --> 03:27.921
Hi.

03:28.922 --> 03:31.007
- Well, class.
- Yeah.

03:38.181 --> 03:40.976
You know when you put your tongue
on the side of the ship...

03:41.143 --> 03:42.185
...and it sticks there?

03:42.352 --> 03:44.479
I hate when I do that.

03:44.646 --> 03:46.314
- Just saying.
- Hey, Stan.

03:46.481 --> 03:47.649
Call ESU.

03:47.816 --> 03:50.902
Let them know the hardware for
the new computer department arrived.

03:51.069 --> 03:52.112
Behold.

03:52.946 --> 03:54.656
I am Mysterio.

03:54.823 --> 03:55.991
Here to save the world...

03:56.158 --> 03:59.911
...from the evils of technology
corrupting the human spirit.

04:01.163 --> 04:03.540
Are we being punked? I hate that.

04:03.707 --> 04:05.500
Silence, fool.

04:05.667 --> 04:10.297
These hands possess all the powers
of the arcane arts.

04:17.178 --> 04:18.512
Such weak wills.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.683
Your dependency on machines
has ravaged your spirits.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.477
But I can save you.

04:23.643 --> 04:25.729
Behold.

04:34.571 --> 04:38.366
The final will cover the interactions
of various biological systems.

04:38.533 --> 04:42.037
And be prepared to define the terms
we've learned this semester...

04:42.204 --> 04:45.665
...for example, survival of the fittest,
natural selection--

04:47.209 --> 04:51.213
All right, more review tomorrow.
But start studying tonight.

04:56.468 --> 04:58.887
<i>This is ridiculous. Just talk to her.</i>

04:59.721 --> 05:03.183
Petey, this biology final's
gonna destroy my GPA.

05:03.350 --> 05:05.602
I'll never pass
unless you tutor me again.

05:05.769 --> 05:07.145
Please?

05:07.312 --> 05:11.066
- Sure.
- Petey, you rock.

05:18.490 --> 05:19.533
Behold.

05:19.699 --> 05:22.077
Another purveyor
of the poisons of progress...

05:22.244 --> 05:24.704
...that banish the old arts
from this world.

05:24.871 --> 05:26.706
Hey, how about we banish you?

05:54.568 --> 05:56.820
Wow, nice trick, bubble-brain.

05:56.987 --> 06:00.740
And I bet the cheesy magician act
really goes over big with the tourists.

06:00.907 --> 06:03.368
You dare call Mysterio a magician?

06:04.035 --> 06:08.373
Fool! Mysterio is no illusionist
playing parlour tricks.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.710
Mysterio is the master
of the arcane arts.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.545
Seems to me
Mysterio is the master...

06:13.712 --> 06:15.922
...of talking about himself
in the third person.

06:16.089 --> 06:18.133
We shall see.

06:39.738 --> 06:41.907
Your will is strong, Spider-Man.

06:42.073 --> 06:44.159
Should you turn your mind
to the spiritual...

06:44.326 --> 06:46.703
...you might one day make
a formidable foe.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.788
But not today.

06:58.006 --> 07:01.134
You have one chance
to abandon your hateful cargo.

07:01.843 --> 07:03.345
I'm thinking it's safer inside.

07:15.941 --> 07:18.944
We'll make a believer out of you yet.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.534
No.

07:30.455 --> 07:32.207
<i>Cold, cold, cold.</i>

07:32.374 --> 07:34.709
<i>Okay, that woke me up.</i>

07:55.188 --> 07:58.858
"Photo by Peter Parker." Very nice.

07:59.025 --> 08:01.569
And just one of your many talents.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.991
And I wish another talent
was keeping warm.

08:06.157 --> 08:07.659
Maybe I can help.

08:07.826 --> 08:11.454
Least I can do, after all the tutelage.

08:12.747 --> 08:14.958
"Authorities recovered
the armoured car...

08:15.125 --> 08:17.419
...but the cargo
was washed out to sea."

08:18.378 --> 08:20.964
The <i>Bugle</i> blames the whole mess
on the Web-Head.

08:21.131 --> 08:24.968
But how is Spider-Man supposed
to battle a real-life sorcerer?

08:25.135 --> 08:27.804
Wait, that's subphylum Chelicerata.

08:27.971 --> 08:29.723
Oh, right, thanks.

08:29.889 --> 08:32.308
And don't worry about Spider-Man.

08:32.475 --> 08:35.227
My dad books magicians at his hotels
all the time.

08:35.395 --> 08:38.356
Took my brother and I backstage
to see how the tricks were done.

08:38.523 --> 08:40.775
It's all about misdirection.

08:40.942 --> 08:43.153
You wind up paying attention
to one thing...

08:43.318 --> 08:46.573
...when you should be paying attention
to another.

08:50.702 --> 08:53.621
So spill, girlfriend. What happened?

08:54.581 --> 08:55.623
Happened?

08:55.790 --> 08:59.294
Please. You can't take your eyes
off him, but you two don't talk.

08:59.461 --> 09:00.628
I kissed him.

09:02.005 --> 09:03.840
That's great. What did he--?

09:04.007 --> 09:05.842
I don't know. I ran away.

09:06.009 --> 09:09.345
And he hasn't said a word
to me since.

09:12.515 --> 09:15.185
Miles, I can't tell you
how pleased we are...

09:15.351 --> 09:18.396
...that Norman convinced you
to join us at ESU.

09:18.563 --> 09:21.274
I'm truly looking forward
to working with you again.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.901
Thanks, Curt. Feeling's mutual.

09:23.068 --> 09:26.821
Well, I'm just glad my hotshot
little brother's back in New York.

09:26.988 --> 09:28.448
Mother will be thrilled too.

09:28.615 --> 09:30.325
So, Dr. Warren...

09:30.492 --> 09:32.619
...what changes can we expect
at the lab?

09:35.121 --> 09:39.334
Miles' past successes have already
attracted much-needed grants...

09:39.501 --> 09:42.295
...as well
as lucrative private funding.

09:42.462 --> 09:45.673
In fact, with this new capital,
I was hoping to rehire...

09:45.840 --> 09:50.303
...our lab assistant, Eddie Brock,
but I've been unable to reach him.

09:51.179 --> 09:54.182
I'm bringing in my own person.
And I'm happy to share.

09:54.349 --> 09:57.644
Plus you have your student interns.
How's Gwen working out?

09:57.811 --> 10:00.063
- Oh, wonderfully.
- Wish we had more like her.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.315
Well, there is Peter Parker.

10:04.192 --> 10:06.986
We had trust issues with Peter.

10:07.153 --> 10:08.446
I realise you dismissed him.

10:08.613 --> 10:10.740
But he's still
the brightest student I have.

10:10.907 --> 10:13.243
I know Peter. A friend of my son's.

10:13.409 --> 10:15.954
I've always found him
very impressive.

10:16.121 --> 10:19.874
All I care about is having the best
available minds at our disposal.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.711
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

10:32.345 --> 10:34.514
Fine. Peter's reinstated.

10:34.681 --> 10:38.601
Wonderful. Here's to continued--

10:39.894 --> 10:41.020
Oscorp business.

10:43.064 --> 10:45.733
Mr. Osborn's on his way.

10:57.078 --> 10:59.914
I summon the dark forces.

11:00.081 --> 11:04.460
Show us your master plan
for this sullied world.

11:20.518 --> 11:25.440
Fools, your technology cannot harm
the Serpents of Elvem.

11:25.607 --> 11:27.275
But don't touch
their poisonous skin.

11:30.195 --> 11:33.114
Don't mind me.
Just had to get in out of the cold.

11:36.034 --> 11:38.703
Gesundheit. So, what did I miss?

11:38.870 --> 11:42.040
Besides getting tagged by one
of your will-weakening spells?

11:42.207 --> 11:43.249
Nothing.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.043
I've saved the best for last...

11:45.210 --> 11:47.503
...and for you.

12:08.816 --> 12:11.569
Hey! I'm cold enough.

12:11.736 --> 12:14.072
I don't need ventilation.

12:20.078 --> 12:21.871
Gotcha.

12:27.043 --> 12:29.170
That's some retirement plan.

12:35.176 --> 12:36.678
- Let go.
- Cut it out.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.432
What a world.

13:05.957 --> 13:07.208
Embarrassing.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.544
Oh, come on.

13:12.297 --> 13:13.756
Want some of this?

13:13.923 --> 13:16.134
- Big bully.
- What do you know?

13:16.301 --> 13:19.721
Guess Mysterio isn't quite
the technophobe he claims to be.

13:20.888 --> 13:22.056
Oh, pimples.

13:22.223 --> 13:24.892
And Spidey strikes out the side.

13:25.059 --> 13:26.853
Now to eject their manager.

13:27.770 --> 13:31.107
Oh, no, you don't, girlfriend.

13:32.275 --> 13:33.901
My work here is done.

13:34.068 --> 13:37.572
Farewell, Spider-Man.

13:50.793 --> 13:53.338
- Oh, no.
- Bye-bye.

13:54.297 --> 13:55.840
Couldn't let go first?

13:56.007 --> 13:59.886
If I'm wrong about this,
at least I'll finally be warm.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.293
And for my next trick...

14:35.713 --> 14:37.173
A prop house.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.633
Liz was right.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.177
Old Mystie's nothing
but smoke and mirrors.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.470
Misdirection.

14:42.637 --> 14:44.639
Now for the man behind the curtain.

15:03.574 --> 15:06.285
Oh, enough with the Latin.
I know it's an act.

15:06.452 --> 15:08.413
But it's such a good act.

15:08.579 --> 15:12.458
And Latin adds
just the right Mysterio-so touch.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.585
For example:

15:16.838 --> 15:19.465
You're in for a world of hurt.

15:36.732 --> 15:40.153
Another illusion projected on mist.

15:40.319 --> 15:41.612
You're catching on.

15:41.779 --> 15:45.658
But what is illusion?
And what is reality?

15:45.825 --> 15:47.368
Around here, not much.

16:02.717 --> 16:05.052
So many threats to life and limb.

16:05.219 --> 16:06.846
But which are real?

16:07.013 --> 16:10.933
Only one way to find out:
ignore what I see and hear.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.519
And may the spider-sense
be with me.

16:45.551 --> 16:49.013
You know, to the unblindfolded,
I'm sure this is all very entertaining.

16:59.273 --> 17:01.943
But effective? Not so much.

17:05.112 --> 17:08.449
So how about we put the show biz
on hold and finish this?

17:08.616 --> 17:10.242
As you wish.

17:13.246 --> 17:16.082
Didn't we just make it clear
your illusions won't work on me?

17:16.249 --> 17:17.583
So we did.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.322
Robots.

17:48.489 --> 17:51.158
And to think
I used to like them as a kid.

18:11.846 --> 18:14.515
Oh, come on, what are you gonna do,
bite my kneecaps off?

18:14.682 --> 18:16.642
Oh, wait, you can't. No mouth.

18:17.476 --> 18:19.812
Somebody doesn't wanna play.

18:29.905 --> 18:31.282
Misdirection.

18:32.950 --> 18:34.535
Magic spell to sap my will?

18:34.702 --> 18:37.997
Or maybe magic gas, colourless,
odourless, to bring me to my knees?

18:38.164 --> 18:40.207
Either way, I'll pass.

18:40.374 --> 18:43.753
Oh, built-in remote controls. Nice.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.886
I'm guessing this one has a head.

18:52.053 --> 18:54.347
So now you know it's me.

18:54.513 --> 18:57.183
Right. Who are you again?

18:57.350 --> 18:58.559
You put me away.

18:58.726 --> 19:00.061
Did I? Cool.

19:00.227 --> 19:03.606
Don't pretend you've forgotten. I was
the Chameleon's right-hand man.

19:03.773 --> 19:05.566
Oh, right, on the boat.

19:05.733 --> 19:08.235
You were dressed as the crewman.

19:08.402 --> 19:11.030
As the waiter.

19:11.197 --> 19:15.368
You remember,
"Demitasse, Spider-Man?"

19:15.534 --> 19:18.120
Sure, sure, if you say so.

19:19.747 --> 19:22.166
Gesundheit.

19:22.917 --> 19:26.420
<i>Okay, one, talk to Gwen. Nope.</i>

19:26.587 --> 19:28.422
<i>Two, find Eddie. Nope.</i>

19:28.589 --> 19:30.424
<i>Three, write Harry. Nope.</i>

19:30.591 --> 19:33.386
<i>Four, buy thermals. Nope.</i>

19:33.552 --> 19:37.098
<i>Five, take care of Aunt May. Nope.</i>

19:37.264 --> 19:40.685
- Aunt May, we talked about this.
- Oh, Peter, don't start.

19:40.851 --> 19:42.895
I'm hardly overexerting myself.

19:43.062 --> 19:46.607
I went to bed early
and had a good night's sleep.

19:47.108 --> 19:48.317
Bless you.

19:48.484 --> 19:51.696
Seems I'm not the one
burning the candle at both ends.

19:51.862 --> 19:53.614
Oh, this came for you yesterday.

19:53.781 --> 19:56.450
A registered letter from the Bugle.

19:58.035 --> 20:02.248
Aunt May,
it's an exclusive freelance contract...

20:02.415 --> 20:04.208
...and an advance.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.753
Robbie said this was coming, but I
figured Jonah would never unclench--

20:07.920 --> 20:11.716
- Peter, that's no way to talk about--
- I gotta tell Gwen.

20:15.302 --> 20:19.014
Of everyone I know,
she's the person I most want to tell.

20:19.181 --> 20:22.143
That means something, right?
I'll call.

20:22.309 --> 20:25.646
We'll meet for breakfast
and we'll talk about everything.

20:25.813 --> 20:28.524
That sounds like a plan.

20:29.108 --> 20:31.485
Perhaps her ears were burning.

20:33.154 --> 20:34.739
No. Mr. Osborn?

20:34.905 --> 20:36.824
Peter. I have some good news.

20:36.991 --> 20:40.119
Curt and Martha Connors wanna
give you another chance at ESU.

20:40.286 --> 20:41.704
<i>What? Really?</i>

20:41.871 --> 20:44.123
- That's great.
- You deserve it, Peter.

20:44.290 --> 20:47.168
Your talents should be nurtured,
and I'd like to do my part.

20:47.334 --> 20:49.003
I'd like to be your mentor.

20:49.170 --> 20:53.174
I don't know what to say.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.801
<i>Except, "Sorry, Norm,
you give me the creeps."</i>

20:55.968 --> 20:57.178
<i>Then you accept?</i>

20:57.344 --> 20:59.805
I can't think of a reason not to.

20:59.972 --> 21:01.307
Excellent. We'll start today.

21:01.474 --> 21:04.935
Come to Oscorp.
We'll have breakfast, talk.

21:05.436 --> 21:07.480
<i>Breakfast? See, I was going to--</i>

21:07.646 --> 21:09.857
Big things are happening
in your life, Peter.

21:10.024 --> 21:11.984
Doesn't pay to waste time.

21:12.902 --> 21:16.030
Okay. I'll come right over.

21:24.371 --> 21:27.208
They're gone. But you're a fool.

21:27.374 --> 21:29.543
Why make your android
look just like you?

21:29.710 --> 21:31.462
You could've made it
look like anyone.

21:31.629 --> 21:36.217
And let anyone take credit
for the role of Mysterio?

21:36.383 --> 21:38.093
Actors.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.054
Master Planner? It's Tinkerer.

21:40.221 --> 21:42.723
Spider-Man and the cops
have come and gone.

21:42.890 --> 21:44.725
They recovered nothing.

21:44.892 --> 21:48.729
Everything you wanted Mysterio
to steal is still right here.

21:48.896 --> 21:50.815
<i>Of course it is.</i>

21:50.981 --> 21:55.277
<i>Everything proceeds
according to my master plan.</i>
