00:23.027 --> 00:26.656
Have the peophe im Chiatow
give a street festivah.

00:26.864 --> 00:32.734
A spontaneous flood of appreciation
tor all I've done for the community.

00:33.103 --> 00:38.370
We couhd have those dragos. Those
big dragos with the guys iside.

00:38.576 --> 00:42.535
Ad maybe we could have a parade.
Yum yum!

00:42.746 --> 00:46.682
Call that big departmemt store.
They got lots of fhoats.

00:46.884 --> 00:49.785
They hkeep them im a warehouse
im New Jersey.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.882
I think I own that.

00:59.597 --> 01:04.534
A, B, C, D, J, IK...

01:09.974 --> 01:11.737

Let go ot my tie!

02:20.577 --> 02:23.512
Bill!
Mr. Clamp, sir, are you okay?

02:23.714 --> 02:27.582
Yeah, I think so. I hate
using these machines myselt.

02:27.785 --> 02:31.915
Sir, we have a problem
We have a situation Oh, my God.

02:32.122 --> 02:35.558
We have to evacuate the building
and close it down.

02:35.759 --> 02:38.421
That's ridiculous.
Betore sundown.

02:38.629 --> 02:42.929
What happens at sundown?
They hate sunlight. It kills them.

02:43.167 --> 02:46.898
When it gets dark,
they'll try to leave the building

02:47.104 --> 02:50.437
Calm down. He should be in custody.
He's dangerous.

02:50.641 --> 02:55.635
This thing, that's dangerous.
This guy's trom the art department.

02:55.846 --> 02:58.747
Ask him how he knows
about these things.

02:58.949 --> 03:01.076
How do you know about them?

03:01.285 --> 03:06.518
This animal was in the genetics lab
I said it could be a problem tenant.

03:06.724 --> 03:11.024
We could have had three shrinks
and a plastic surgeon. Here.

03:26.710 --> 03:28.701
Make a wish!

03:36.053 --> 03:38.146
Ah, hair!

03:50.134 --> 03:51.624
Going down!

04:02.312 --> 04:04.746
Second floor, lingerie.

04:12.923 --> 04:19.055
The ehevator doors have opemed.
Phease heave, amd watch your step.

04:19.730 --> 04:23.166
We'll...
We'll get the next one.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.100
You don't think it had rabies?
No.

04:26.303 --> 04:31.070
We must stop them from getting wet.
No, we have to put a lid on it.

04:31.275 --> 04:34.711
No cops, no media.
We'll handle this ourselves.

04:34.912 --> 04:40.077
You go down to systems control.
But there might be physical danger.

04:40.284 --> 04:42.616
You're supposed to handle bugs.

04:42.820 --> 04:47.382
Well, I'd call these some goddamn
major bugs, wouldn't you? Huh?

04:47.591 --> 04:52.028
Okay. But I don't think
I should try it without an expert.

04:52.229 --> 04:54.094
Let's go, Peltzer.

04:58.101 --> 05:00.399
Three, two, one. Cue Leonard.

05:00.604 --> 05:04.540
Hi. I'm Leomard Maltim,
ad this is The Movie Police.

05:05.142 --> 05:06.769
First, our video watch.

05:06.977 --> 05:11.573
Just rereleased on video is Gremlis,
though I can't imagine why.

05:11.782 --> 05:17.049
I know some people tound it tun, but
I'd rather have root canal work done.

05:17.254 --> 05:21.953
What's tun about a movie full of ugly,
mean spirited monsters...

05:22.159 --> 05:24.753
...who attack innocent people?

05:24.962 --> 05:29.729
Are we so desperate tor entertainment
that this trash passes tor fun?

05:29.967 --> 05:31.400
Wait a minute!

05:44.848 --> 05:50.844
Look at this. I've been working on
making tomatoes tougher for shipping.

05:51.054 --> 05:54.615
That's territic!
Topnotch! How do they taste?

05:54.825 --> 06:00.263
That's the best part. We've already
had calls from two airline chets.

06:04.568 --> 06:07.799
Oh, my gosh!

06:07.971 --> 06:11.702
Did somebody leave something out?
Not I.

06:11.909 --> 06:14.844
It's eating my vegetable medley.

06:21.218 --> 06:24.187
What's that noise?
I think they're laughing.

06:24.521 --> 06:27.183
Reptiles don't laugh!
They're not reptiles.

06:27.391 --> 06:29.882
Then what are they?
A virus?

06:35.566 --> 06:38.091
What on earth is going on?

06:40.037 --> 06:43.871
I leave you alone, what do I tind
when I get back? Chaos!

06:47.077 --> 06:50.808
Is that the brain hormone
that creature's drinking?

06:51.014 --> 06:54.381
Good boy. Nice boy.

06:54.585 --> 06:59.420
There's a good creature.
Now, let's talk this over.

06:59.856 --> 07:04.987
I can get you diseases.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

07:12.135 --> 07:14.228
Perhaps not.

07:39.930 --> 07:43.764
I wanna talk...

07:44.001 --> 07:46.469
...about what's going on in here.

07:46.703 --> 07:51.003
There are some tascinating
ramifications tor the future.

07:51.208 --> 07:55.577
When you introduce genetic
material to our life torm...

07:55.779 --> 07:58.577
...which is possessed of a sort of...

07:58.782 --> 08:01.148
...I hesitate to say "atavism"...

08:01.351 --> 08:04.218
...but let us say
an aggressive nature.

08:04.421 --> 08:09.688
That tellow over there is a common bat
of the order ot Chiroptera.

08:09.893 --> 08:13.920
The only mammals, I might add,
capable ot true tlight.

08:33.015 --> 08:35.381
Ah, genetic sunblock!

08:36.586 --> 08:37.847
Yes.

08:42.325 --> 08:47.194
Might I have a word with you?
My friend, you have potential.

08:47.397 --> 08:50.855
I wanna help you be all
that you can be. May I?

08:51.201 --> 08:56.468
As you're aware, sunlight poses
a problem for our ethnic group.

08:56.673 --> 08:58.664
We don't tan or burn.

08:58.875 --> 09:03.312
We become a rather unappetizing
photochemical lettover.

09:03.513 --> 09:08.746
Thus this tormula, designed for those
of the nocturnal persuasion...

09:08.952 --> 09:11.477
...to make light no problem at all.

09:11.688 --> 09:15.215
That'll be usetul
where you'll be going.

09:17.561 --> 09:19.256
Where he'll be going?

09:19.463 --> 09:24.093
All they have to do is eat children,
there'd be appalling publicity.

09:26.203 --> 09:30.333
There it is. The Apple.
The city so nice they named it twice.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.839
Check it out one time, won't you?

09:42.953 --> 09:44.750
Catch it! Don't let it go!

09:44.955 --> 09:46.820
Down!
Down!

10:06.743 --> 10:08.608
Here im Mahatta...

10:08.812 --> 10:13.442
...there's beem a steady stream
of mechaicah probhems...

10:13.650 --> 10:17.882
...at the Champ Cemtre
office buihdig im midtow...

10:32.068 --> 10:33.660
Buy! Buy!
Sell! Sell!

10:33.904 --> 10:36.099
I'd say it's a tull scale panic.

10:36.306 --> 10:40.766
Are you having a run on the banks yet?
It's brutal here.

10:40.977 --> 10:45.346
We're telling clients to invest
in canned food and shotguns.

10:46.116 --> 10:49.882
Phease take a momet to locate
the mearest exit.

10:50.086 --> 10:54.716
Go to it quickly because
of the dager i the buildimg.

10:54.925 --> 10:57.723
Phease take persomah belomgimgs

10:57.928 --> 11:01.329

11:01.565 --> 11:04.329
...attemptig to leave the buildimg.

11:14.945 --> 11:17.971
Food tight! Food tight! Food tight!

11:31.995 --> 11:37.524
Fire: The utamed ehememt, giver
of warmth, destroyer of forests.

11:37.767 --> 11:40.736
This buildimg is o fire.
What?

11:40.937 --> 11:43.906
The buildimg is o fire.
Leave the buildimg.

11:44.140 --> 11:47.473
Eact the age old drama
of sehf preservatiom.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.976
Oh, Murray, the cathedral
of Saint Eva Marie.

11:54.184 --> 11:58.587
What a beautiful building!
Beautiful?

11:58.822 --> 12:01.518
It's like something
out of the Dark Ages.

12:01.725 --> 12:04.250
Hey, Quasimodo, you home?

12:08.265 --> 12:09.232
Hey...

12:15.372 --> 12:18.205
It's one of them!
Who?

12:19.976 --> 12:21.534
Get otf!

12:44.000 --> 12:47.936
It's just a tlesh wound, Murray!

13:54.371 --> 13:58.865
Hurry up, Lewis!
I'm coming, Martin!

14:00.043 --> 14:02.876
The horror. The horror. The breakage!

14:03.079 --> 14:04.910
Sir, what happened?

14:05.115 --> 14:08.312
They fought back,
that's what happened.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.281
Things.

14:10.487 --> 14:12.318
Stuft.

14:12.522 --> 14:15.650
I swear, I'll never hurt
anything again.

14:15.992 --> 14:18.517
Some things man isn't meant to splice.

14:18.728 --> 14:20.958
A problem tenant.
Calm down.

14:21.197 --> 14:24.166
We won't renew your lease.
Where are they?

14:24.367 --> 14:27.268
Don't patronize me! I saw them.

14:27.470 --> 14:31.497
But where?
In my laboratory, the Splice ot Life.

14:31.708 --> 14:35.007
Stupid name. But it wasn't my idea.

14:50.527 --> 14:53.087
Bunny rabbit.

14:54.964 --> 14:57.899
"Fourscore and seven years ago..."

15:03.973 --> 15:06.100
Nudie, nudie, nudie!

15:16.486 --> 15:19.080
Mom, I wanna see the Gremlins!

15:19.289 --> 15:24.352
Sir, I can't believe this.
This is worse than the first one.

15:24.561 --> 15:28.088
We just show these movies,
we don't make them.

15:28.331 --> 15:29.423
But

15:29.666 --> 15:32.897
I quit. Call the union,
the National Guard.

15:33.136 --> 15:36.003
Those things took over the projector.

15:36.206 --> 15:40.165
All they wanna see
is Sow White amd the Sevem Dwarfs.

15:40.376 --> 15:42.207
Enough!

15:42.412 --> 15:45.040
I'll take care ot this.

15:51.955 --> 15:55.755
Mr. Hulk, we have Gremlins
in the projection booth.

15:55.959 --> 16:00.362
Could you help us?
Gremlins? In this theater? Now?

16:01.531 --> 16:05.968
Okay, guys, listen up.
People paid money to see this movie.

16:06.102 --> 16:09.936
When they go out,
they want cold sodas, popcorn...

16:10.140 --> 16:12.836
...and no monsters
in the projection booth.

16:13.042 --> 16:15.010
Do I have to come up there?

16:15.211 --> 16:18.612
Can the Gremsters stand up
to the Hulkster?

16:18.815 --> 16:23.718
It I were you, I'd run the rest
of Gremlis 2 right now!

16:23.920 --> 16:26.889
Sorry, tolks. It won't happen again.

16:48.011 --> 16:51.469
I'm outside the Champ Cemtre

wouhd hike to forget.

17:00.056 --> 17:02.286

Oce we are allowed i...

17:08.565 --> 17:11.932
...we'll broadcast hive
from iside the buildimg.

17:12.135 --> 17:13.500
Live...

17:14.137 --> 17:16.401
...from inside.

17:26.683 --> 17:28.878
Hey, you! Come here.

17:29.085 --> 17:32.248
No! Can you work a TV camera?

17:32.589 --> 17:35.422
Work a camera? I am a camera!

17:35.625 --> 17:37.684
Oh, good! Come with me.

17:37.927 --> 17:40.225
No, this way. This way.

18:28.478 --> 18:30.571
I know, you think I'm insane.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.715
No, it you were, we couldn't sue you.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.879
Oh, my God.
You see?

18:38.254 --> 18:41.348
This is a complete tailure...

18:41.858 --> 18:43.018
...ot management.

18:43.559 --> 18:48.326
They're eating the genetic stuft.
Years ot research, patents!

18:48.564 --> 18:50.930
Are there any bright lights here?

18:51.167 --> 18:56.469
They've broken them all. But I do
have some small assault weapons.

19:04.847 --> 19:08.476
What a hunk!

19:21.531 --> 19:24.989
Don't be afraid ot your feelings!
Help!

19:25.835 --> 19:28.429
It's a hobby I knew
would come in handy.

19:28.671 --> 19:33.404
I got ordnance here that can
drop a charging puma at 50 feet.

19:42.185 --> 19:44.551
Oh, why can't you commit?

19:44.754 --> 19:48.747
That's what these things need,
a taste ot

19:51.027 --> 19:53.860
Get it otf! Get it otf! Get it otf!

20:48.985 --> 20:53.046
To survive a war,
you gotta become war.

20:56.125 --> 20:58.958
Let us in there.
We'll take responsibility.

20:59.162 --> 21:01.392
Most people are out anyway.

21:01.631 --> 21:06.159
What's in there? I've been to Beirut.
I bet they miss you there.

21:06.502 --> 21:09.938
The important thing is
to keep this out ot the media.

21:10.139 --> 21:12.437
They get you to say something...

21:12.642 --> 21:18.274
...then they twist and embellish it,
and betore you know it

21:18.481 --> 21:21.882
hive, exclusively
over the Clamp News Chameh...

21:22.218 --> 21:25.381
...from the hobby,
where this ivasiom...

21:25.721 --> 21:30.385
...by strage creatures,
perhaps from amother gahaxy...

21:30.593 --> 21:34.654
...or from a dimemsiomah warp...

21:35.031 --> 21:39.161
...has ru riot through this buihdig,
sedig peophe...

21:39.402 --> 21:40.562
Dracula?

21:55.952 --> 22:01.117
These horrible little green
monsters in that building there!

22:01.324 --> 22:03.849
You can't do that...

22:04.060 --> 22:07.791
Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold it! No water.
What?

22:08.030 --> 22:11.466
That's not a fire in there.
They're gremlins.

22:11.701 --> 22:15.797
You get them wet, they'll multiply.
I can deal with them.

22:16.038 --> 22:21.499
Sure, pal. Why don't you calm down?
Just take it easy.

22:21.711 --> 22:25.408
Don't talk to me like I'm crazy.
I'm not crazy!

22:26.682 --> 22:30.049
I was never crazy. I'm tine.

22:30.853 --> 22:32.115
Let me in there!

22:59.582 --> 23:03.416
Bill, any progress?
Just tell me there's progress.

23:03.619 --> 23:06.315
Things are really bad out there.

23:06.656 --> 23:10.353
Bad?! Only one ot my channels
is still on the air.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.552
There are human beings
in the building.

23:13.763 --> 23:17.392
Do you know what kind of lawsuits
we're looking at?

23:17.633 --> 23:19.225
Yes, I know, but

23:28.144 --> 23:30.305
Ahh of our operators are busy.

23:30.513 --> 23:34.381
Your cahh will be hadled
im the order received.

23:34.584 --> 23:36.950
What is that?
One ot those things.

23:37.153 --> 23:40.782
They come in electric too?
They do now.

23:40.990 --> 23:43.686
He's in the phone system on hold.

23:51.867 --> 23:57.430
I thought this would never run.
Maybe it will, now.

24:02.678 --> 24:08.048
Because of the emd of civilizatio,
CCN mow leaves the air.

24:08.250 --> 24:11.947
We hope you have emjoyed
our programmig.

24:12.154 --> 24:17.091
But more importamthy,
we hope you have ejoyed hife.

24:17.293 --> 24:22.094
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, sir. It's very uplitting.

24:22.331 --> 24:28.133
Is there any way to turn the clocks
ahead in the building three hours?

24:28.337 --> 24:31.238
There's nothing we can't do. Why?

24:31.574 --> 24:33.565
Sunlight kills them.

24:33.776 --> 24:38.406
It we can tool them into thinking
the sun has gone down...

24:38.748 --> 24:40.648
...they may go to the lobby.

24:40.816 --> 24:45.344
Right! The front doors are the only
way out of the building.

24:45.554 --> 24:49.820
The sun sets at 7:32.
Then we should move at 4:20.

24:50.026 --> 24:53.553
I like that!
We have intormation they don't have.

24:53.763 --> 24:57.164
That's how you take somebody out.
Wait a minute.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.233
Won't they see the sun's still out?

25:00.436 --> 25:03.098
You'll have to take care of that.
Me?

25:03.305 --> 25:06.240
Set it up trom the outside.
Good!

25:06.575 --> 25:09.203
I finally get to use my secret exit.

25:09.412 --> 25:11.312
You know, sir?
Yes?

25:11.514 --> 25:14.677
It you pull this otf,
you could save the city.

25:14.884 --> 25:19.150
Save the city? "Developer Saves City."
I like that!

25:34.503 --> 25:38.439
Is anyone still employed
in this charming facility?

25:38.641 --> 25:41.041
I need light in my otfice. Now!

25:41.243 --> 25:46.579
At Champ Emterprises we wat you
to achieve ahh you cam.

25:46.782 --> 25:49.774
Turn on the lights in my otfice.

25:49.985 --> 25:53.421
You want me to work in the dark?

25:55.057 --> 25:56.957
This is new.

26:23.519 --> 26:26.044
Hey, that's Clamp! Let's go!

26:30.693 --> 26:34.129
Has the building been evacuated?
Is it on fire?

26:34.330 --> 26:37.766
That's a false alarm.
We've just got some problems.

26:37.967 --> 26:41.266
You got a guy in there
in a Dracula suit.

26:41.470 --> 26:44.030
Are you trying to panic the city?

26:44.240 --> 26:46.708
So they are real?
I didn't say that.

26:46.909 --> 26:50.003
What are you saying?
What I always say.

27:04.927 --> 27:05.916
Murray?

27:35.691 --> 27:36.885
Gizmo?

28:32.381 --> 28:34.679
As you probably kow

28:36.018 --> 28:40.182
As you probably kow,
a emtire race of strage beigs...

28:40.389 --> 28:42.619
...has imvaded the buihdig.

28:42.825 --> 28:48.161
Amd i am evem more bizarre twist,
oe of the creatures

28:49.098 --> 28:52.158
"Creatures." Is that accurate?

28:55.371 --> 28:59.205
That one ot these creatures
is able to talk...

28:59.408 --> 29:02.741
...and he's going to talk
with us right now.

29:02.945 --> 29:05.413
The main question people have is:

29:05.748 --> 29:08.308
Creature, what is it that you want?

29:08.517 --> 29:10.712
Fred, what we want...

29:10.920 --> 29:15.254
...is what you and your viewers have:
Civilization.

29:15.591 --> 29:19.857
Yes, but what sort ot civilization
are you speaking ot?

29:20.062 --> 29:22.326
The iceties. The fime poits.

29:22.564 --> 29:26.261
Diphomacy, compassiom, stadards,
mamers, traditio.

29:26.468 --> 29:28.436
That's what we reach toward.

29:28.804 --> 29:32.103
We may stumble on the way,
but civilization, yes.

29:32.308 --> 29:35.072
The Geneva Convention, Susan Sontag.

29:35.277 --> 29:39.577
Everything you've worked hard
to accomplish, we aspire to.

29:39.782 --> 29:44.549
We wanna be civilized.
Take a look at this tellow here.

29:47.856 --> 29:50.723
Now, was that civilized? Clearly not.

29:50.926 --> 29:53.622
Fun, but in no sense civilized.

29:53.829 --> 29:56.730
Nome of us has beem
im New Yorhk before.

29:56.966 --> 30:00.402
We have to hearm how to get
tickets for shows.

30:00.602 --> 30:04.595
There's street crime,
but we cam watch that for free.

30:04.840 --> 30:08.742
We wamt the essetiahs.
Diettes, bedroom groups...

30:08.944 --> 30:12.072
...credit evem if we've
bee tured dow before.

30:12.648 --> 30:16.516
Take it easy with that thing.
Be careful up there!

30:16.852 --> 30:18.786
What's that thing tor?

30:18.988 --> 30:22.321
These things can only come out
when it's dark.

30:22.524 --> 30:26.483
We set the clocks ahead.
When they think it's sunset...

30:26.695 --> 30:31.598
...and see what a nice night it is,
they'll muster in the lobby.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.793
The sunlight'll pour through here
and try them!

30:36.038 --> 30:37.005
Sure.

31:12.207 --> 31:15.233
Is it safe?
Help!

31:16.078 --> 31:17.875
Billy!

31:22.284 --> 31:24.377
I hate these little things!

31:30.993 --> 31:33.826
You okay, Billy?
Yeah. Get me out of here.

31:37.566 --> 31:41.468
Billy?
Could I get some help here, please?

31:41.670 --> 31:44.605
I'm trapped in adhesive
polymer material...

31:44.807 --> 31:47.037
...and I'm on deadline!

31:47.242 --> 31:50.268
Darling, it's you!
Thank God you're here.

31:50.479 --> 31:54.779
Well, I could help you,
or I could just leave you here.

31:54.983 --> 31:59.215
Listen, about Billy. Nothing happened.

31:59.421 --> 32:03.619
I asked him out to dinner.
It was strictly business.

32:03.826 --> 32:07.819
Okay, it wasn't completely business,
I'll be honest.

32:08.030 --> 32:10.055
It'll be an openness thing.

32:10.299 --> 32:14.497
I had designs on him.
I didn't get to tirst base. Okay?

32:14.736 --> 32:20.971
It'll do.
What a wondertully prepared woman.

34:02.844 --> 34:04.812
What happened to him?

34:06.348 --> 34:09.545
I don't know.
I guess they pushed him too far.

34:16.425 --> 34:19.326
If they get out
We'll stop them, Billy.

34:19.494 --> 34:20.859
Don't give up now.

34:21.029 --> 34:22.963
Washington didn't.
Lincoln

34:23.165 --> 34:24.496
Please!
What?

34:24.699 --> 34:26.224
Don't mention Lincoln.

34:26.435 --> 34:31.202
A terrible thing happened
to me once on Lincoln's birthday.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.967
I was 6 or 7.

34:34.176 --> 34:37.942
I had the day oft trom school.
Mama sent me to the park.

34:38.112 --> 34:44.109
She made me a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. That's all I ever ate.

34:44.286 --> 34:47.346
A man with a beard and hat
Just like Lincoln.

34:47.522 --> 34:50.753
Honey, we don't have
time for this now.

34:50.926 --> 34:54.487
I remember Oh, God.
He said, "Hello, little girl."

35:04.439 --> 35:05.929
Is everybody here?

35:06.441 --> 35:07.874
All right, then!

35:42.311 --> 35:43.539
These guys aren't bad.

35:43.879 --> 35:46.780
Incredible as it seems,
ladies and gentlemen...

35:46.948 --> 35:52.079
...atter their bizarre, bloodcurdling
rampage of destruction...

35:52.254 --> 35:57.715
...these strange creatures now appear
to be mounting what seems to be...

35:57.893 --> 36:00.088
...a musical number.

36:50.812 --> 36:52.609
They're near the doors.

36:52.781 --> 36:56.273
Don't worry. Soon Mr. Clamp
will drop the cloth...

36:56.451 --> 36:58.112
...and let in the sun.

36:58.653 --> 37:02.089
Okay, are we ready to drop this thing?

37:12.134 --> 37:14.034
Sunlight?

37:46.201 --> 37:48.692
Say cheese!

38:18.900 --> 38:24.600
They get in the rain, the city
will go under. Armageddon! WWIII!

38:24.773 --> 38:28.106
Billy, we've gotta do something.
I know.

38:30.078 --> 38:34.014
There's a fire hose.
Aim it into the lobby.

38:34.216 --> 38:35.547
Are you crazy?

38:35.717 --> 38:37.344
Just do it, and fast!

38:37.519 --> 38:40.852
Put Gizmo in a box
so he doesn't get wet.

38:41.022 --> 38:42.182
Marla

38:42.357 --> 38:44.222
Smoke.
Thanks.

38:58.573 --> 38:59.631
Loogie!

39:05.914 --> 39:07.404
Lobby!

39:08.416 --> 39:10.384
Don't mess with Futterman!

39:15.790 --> 39:20.591
There's a call on hold in Mr. Clamp's
oftice. Can you transter it here?

39:20.762 --> 39:22.286
Yeah, I think so.

39:25.133 --> 39:26.600
Ready!

39:26.768 --> 39:27.826
Turn it on!

39:55.597 --> 39:58.964
Billy, I hope you know
what the hell you're doing.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.725
I'm singing in the bathtub!

40:02.637 --> 40:05.834
Bypass the file server.

40:09.744 --> 40:12.008
That's it!
My God!

40:12.814 --> 40:14.509
Turn otf the hose!

40:18.420 --> 40:19.409
Hit it!

41:10.772 --> 41:12.205
I'm melting!

41:14.275 --> 41:17.267
Oh, what a world, what a world!

41:22.517 --> 41:28.615
The creatures seem to be melting into
horrible little green and brown...

41:29.224 --> 41:31.954
...puddles. It's, it's like...

41:32.127 --> 41:37.429
Well, I can't say what it looks like,
on television, but it looks terrible.

41:59.187 --> 42:01.553
Let's go! Come on!

42:03.692 --> 42:09.892
It's stuck. Come on. Back up here.
Down there. Come on! Let's go!

42:10.231 --> 42:12.961
We'll take them by this door.
Come on!

42:13.168 --> 42:15.295
Charge!

42:28.283 --> 42:32.481
I didn't hurt myselt. Maybe we can
use this stutf for landfill.

42:32.654 --> 42:37.148
We're here with Daniel R. Clamp.
Hey! Hey! Wait a minute, pal!

42:37.325 --> 42:40.158
Who told you to go on my network?

42:40.328 --> 42:44.662
Nobody, sir.
It just seemed like news, so

42:44.866 --> 42:51.271
Right, right. I'm making you
an anchor. Six o'clock, weeknights.

42:51.439 --> 42:55.739
Go to Barneys and get new clothes.
Give this man a credit card.

42:55.910 --> 42:59.368
This is Old World.
Think sweaters. Think avuncular.

42:59.547 --> 43:01.378
Right. Avuncular!

43:01.549 --> 43:04.609
And my cameraman?
Otf cafteine, he's okay.

43:04.786 --> 43:07.277
I'm a hit!
We're a hit.

43:07.455 --> 43:12.392
What does a menswear makeover cost
today? Join us as we investigate

43:12.560 --> 43:14.687
And get some sun this weekend!

43:14.863 --> 43:17.354
Hey, Bill! Oh, boy!

43:19.901 --> 43:22.961
What's happening?
It moved, sir.

43:23.171 --> 43:28.234
All right. Carry on.
Caretul, that stuft's slippery.

43:28.409 --> 43:29.842
So you bailed us out.

43:30.011 --> 43:34.311
It wasn't just me. We all chipped in.
Mr. Futterman and Marla.

43:34.482 --> 43:35.710
Marla?

43:36.718 --> 43:37.810
Yes, sir?

43:37.986 --> 43:40.420
You work for me, don't you?

43:43.625 --> 43:45.092
Yes, sir.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.421
Very, very hard.

43:56.704 --> 43:58.228
What happened?

43:58.640 --> 44:01.200
They tried it again,
but we were ready.

44:01.376 --> 44:05.244
Let's go. Smells like burnt meatloat.
It's Daniel Clamp!

44:05.413 --> 44:09.042
He's here!
Mr. Clamp, can we have a statement?

44:09.217 --> 44:10.514
Please, please!

44:10.919 --> 44:16.380
My new head ot public relations here
will handle all questions.

44:16.958 --> 44:17.947
Why, Daniel!

44:18.126 --> 44:22.062
What happened?
Where's the camera? It was horrible.

44:22.230 --> 44:24.960
We had to stop work altogether.

44:25.166 --> 44:27.634
Sorry about the building.
I'm not.

44:27.802 --> 44:31.033
You're not?
No, we're insured tor the damages.

44:31.206 --> 44:35.506
Maybe it wasn't a place
tor people anyway.

44:35.677 --> 44:41.013
It was a place for things. You make
a place for things. Things come.

44:41.216 --> 44:43.878
You kept the city safe, sir.

44:44.052 --> 44:48.079
That's right. That's a good point.
The sacrifice.

44:48.256 --> 44:51.248
Could be in my next book!
I should take notes.

44:51.426 --> 44:55.829
Who's got a pencil and paper?
Here you go.

44:59.334 --> 45:01.302
What's this?
IKingston Falls.

45:01.536 --> 45:04.096
I've looked tor this!
To buy?

45:04.305 --> 45:09.072
No, to build for my next project
in Jersey! This is terrific!

45:09.244 --> 45:12.771
People want the traditional
community thing now.

45:12.947 --> 45:15.973
Quiet little towns, back to the earth.

45:16.150 --> 45:17.742
Is this your concept?

45:17.919 --> 45:22.913
It's our hometown.
That's better. I love that! It's...

45:23.091 --> 45:25.821
Wait. It's...

45:25.994 --> 45:31.296
"Clamp Corners. Where life
slows down to a crawl."

45:31.499 --> 45:34.127
What do you think?
It's territic.

45:34.535 --> 45:38.198
This is what people want,
not talking elevators.

45:38.373 --> 45:42.036
You sell me this design,
and we'll build the biggest...

45:42.210 --> 45:45.145
...most sensational
quiet little town ever.

45:45.313 --> 45:49.613
But tor him to do an entire town
We can come to a deal.

45:49.784 --> 45:55.848
Are you Mrs. Peltzer?
Yes! Well, I'm gonna be.

45:56.024 --> 45:59.255
What's that?
This is Gizmo.

45:59.560 --> 46:01.755
He's a Mogwai.
Mogwai.

46:01.930 --> 46:05.388
I look at him, you know what I see?
What, sir?

46:05.600 --> 46:08.728
Dolls with suction cups
staring out car windows.

46:08.937 --> 46:13.135
A Macy's parade float. Have you
thought about merchandising?

46:13.308 --> 46:14.900
Me? No.
Yeah!

46:15.076 --> 46:18.842
There's something there.
Lose the headband, though.

46:19.047 --> 46:21.015
He likes the headband.

46:21.182 --> 46:23.810
It's flexible. Excuse me.

46:24.018 --> 46:27.112
Most buildings wouldn't stand up
to this...

46:29.724 --> 46:30.952
Go home now.

46:37.432 --> 46:40.196
No visit to New Yorhk
is comphete without...

46:40.401 --> 46:46.203
...tourig the world's most
Put a glaze ot cheese on top.

46:46.407 --> 46:48.932
Your favorite.
Yeah, sure.

46:49.110 --> 46:50.907
Showtime! MTV.

46:51.079 --> 46:53.343
Are you coming?
In a minute.

46:53.848 --> 46:55.839
HBO.
What did he say?

46:56.017 --> 46:57.348
He wants cable.

46:57.518 --> 46:59.679
Nick at Nite?
No.

47:02.690 --> 47:04.248
Have a cigarette?
No.

47:04.425 --> 47:05.414
I'll quit.

47:05.593 --> 47:08.118
From the building.
In the building?

47:08.296 --> 47:14.132
Hello? Forster, what are you?
Okay, we'll get you out. What floor?

47:14.302 --> 47:18.238
Way up there! Lt'll take a while.
The elevators are out.

47:18.406 --> 47:20.237
So are the automatic doors.

47:20.408 --> 47:25.072
I don't know, not long. We'll do what
we can. IKeep your pants on.

47:25.513 --> 47:30.280
You've beem worhkimg too hard.
Maybe I have, Mr. Clamp.

47:30.451 --> 47:34.012
Take a day off. Half a day.
That's generous, sir.

47:34.188 --> 47:38.648
A half day oft once the building
is operational. Thank you, sir.

50:26.861 --> 50:29.193
Long, isn't it?

51:25.052 --> 51:27.452
Patently ridiculous!

52:00.554 --> 52:05.321
Still lurking about?
Don't you people have homes?

52:54.642 --> 52:55.802
That's

52:55.976 --> 52:57.136
Oh, no, you don't!

52:57.311 --> 53:01.577
