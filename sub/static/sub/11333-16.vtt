00:02.085 --> 00:03.337
Previously on 90210:

00:03.378 --> 00:05.088
News flash-- Teddy Montgomery
is a major player.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.340
There's no need to worry.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.549
You just have to be
sensible, that's all.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.969
So check his e-mail,
monitor his cell phone

00:10.010 --> 00:11.178
and follow him occasionally.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.179
You spied on me?

00:12.220 --> 00:13.347
It's never going
to happen again.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.849
'Cause now I know
I can trust you.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.558
I need some space, okay?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.102
Hi, I'm Dana.
I'm Dixon's birth mom.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.689
My son's birth mother
has come to stay with us
for a little while.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.607
How's that going?
I think it's hard for him.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.066
I meant how is it
going for you?

00:25.108 --> 00:27.611
So all this anxiety
was for nothing, right?

00:27.653 --> 00:30.030
You know, everything I'm feeling
is valid, okay?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.615
Guys, where the hell
is my car?

00:31.657 --> 00:34.409
Who do you think got rid
of the one piece of evidence

00:34.451 --> 00:36.119
that's linking you
to my uncle's death?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.246
You like somebody,
and you haven't told me?

00:38.288 --> 00:41.082
The problem is... I like you.

00:54.221 --> 00:58.517
(car horn honking)

00:58.559 --> 01:00.519
(sighs): You mind?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.771
This space is occupied.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.814
Come on.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.482
It's the last one in the lot.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.108
(horn honking)
(sighs)

01:09.361 --> 01:10.946
(drumming on hood)

01:13.198 --> 01:14.449
(Liam chuckles)

01:19.621 --> 01:22.165
JASPER:
Annie, slow down.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
Look, I know that
you're freaked out

01:24.167 --> 01:25.794
over what I did, and I'm sorry.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.963
But you have to understand that
I was just trying to help you.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.965
I mean, I don't want anyone
to be able to link you

01:30.007 --> 01:32.009
to my uncle's death.
Just stop.

01:32.051 --> 01:35.846
You have to know I'll do
anything for you, anything.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.933
You really want
to do something for me?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.060
Just leave me alone.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.362
Okay, Blazers, listen up.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.155
I've got a really exciting
announcement to make.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.532
You guys are late.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.534
We have a new
faculty advisor--

01:57.576 --> 01:59.036
Mr. Cannon, everyone.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.791
Now, Mr. Cannon brings
some serious street
cred to the Blaze.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.709
Uh, he was a journalism
major at Columbia,

02:05.751 --> 02:08.169
and he also interned at
60 Minutes, before diving back

02:08.211 --> 02:10.338
into academia.
Thank you, Navid.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.633
I see my role here
as challenging

02:12.674 --> 02:13.884
each and every
one of you

02:13.926 --> 02:15.385
to do better, dig deeper,

02:15.427 --> 02:18.806
find the journalistic truth
in all the stories that we tell.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
I have a question.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.850
Yes.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.685
Hi. Naomi Clark.
Hi.

02:23.727 --> 02:27.188
So what happens if I--
like you said-- dig deeper,

02:27.230 --> 02:29.441
find the journalistic truth,
blah, blah, blah,

02:29.483 --> 02:32.820
but it all gets
edited out by Navid?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.822
Well...
Oh, tha-that's
because, uh,

02:34.863 --> 02:35.906
you don't cite your sources.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.908
And if I'm protecting
my sources?

02:37.950 --> 02:40.201
A friend of a
friend of a guy

02:40.243 --> 02:42.162
you used to date? No, that's not
a credible source.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.873
Actually, I do have to agree
with Navid on this one.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.374
If we can't verify
the information,

02:46.416 --> 02:47.375
then we shouldn't air it.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.877
We're not a tabloid here.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.838
But we can be.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.547
You ever heard of making
a good first impression?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.591
Ms. Clark, if you'd
like me to review

02:54.633 --> 02:56.217
any segments
you're unhappy with,

02:56.259 --> 02:59.554
I'd be glad to give you my
honest, unbiased critique, but

02:59.596 --> 03:02.432
I'm warning you, I have
very high standards.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.434
Well, they couldn't
be that high,

03:04.476 --> 03:06.061
or you'd be
working in news--

03:06.103 --> 03:07.562
and not bossing a bunch

03:07.604 --> 03:10.024
of wannabe kids around for what,
20 grand a year?

03:10.065 --> 03:13.568
(students murmuring)

03:13.610 --> 03:16.321
If you're done, I'd like to
discuss the next Blaze edition.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.322
But I'm not.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.239
Yes, you are.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.371
NAOMI (scoffs):
Why do we even need

03:24.412 --> 03:27.374
some stupid faculty advisor
watching over our every move?

03:27.415 --> 03:29.960
Oh, my God, it's like
1984 all over again.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.587
I hope not. I look horrible
in shoulder pads and a perm.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.715
NAOMI:
Come on, Sil,
just tell Ade

03:34.756 --> 03:37.467
how bad Cannon
was, please?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.385
Or not.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.888
Hey.
Hey.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.806
So I was wondering if you maybe

03:42.848 --> 03:44.349
want to have lunch today.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.101
Sorry, I'm taking
a history make-up.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.144
Got to run, actually.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.436
Yeah...

03:48.478 --> 03:51.272
Everything good with
the world again?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.525
No. I just asked him
to have lunch with me,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.944
and he claimed he had to
make up a history test.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.488
Obviously, he's still pissed
at me for spying on him.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.241
That, or he actually has
to make up a history test

04:01.282 --> 04:03.202
and I'm just getting
worked up over nothing.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.411
Or both.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.954
No. You know you can't
leave anything

04:05.996 --> 04:07.206
to interpretation with men.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.083
Next time just ask,
"Am I in or out?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.792
"'Cause I'm not popping
the pill every day

04:10.834 --> 04:12.920
just to get rid of zits
and PMS."

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
Okay, that's
your solution?

04:14.504 --> 04:15.839
We're not even
having sex yet.

04:15.881 --> 04:16.964
Wow.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
Well, no wonder
he's blowing you off.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.260
Come on. Right, Ade?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.344
Uh, yeah, whatever.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.638
Um, I got to run
to my locker.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.973
I will catch
you guys later.

04:25.015 --> 04:25.974
Bye.
Yeah.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.975
Okay.
Sure.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.149
ANNIE:
Wait!

04:34.191 --> 04:37.861
Wait, stop!

04:39.029 --> 04:40.781
Oh...

04:40.822 --> 04:42.282
(sighs)

04:45.786 --> 04:47.495
Do you need a ride?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.748
I'm all right, thanks.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.170
Annie, come on,
let me drive you.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.631
All right, thank you.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.975
DIXON: Yeah, sure the
Cavs have LeBron,

05:08.016 --> 05:11.519
but Shaq, he's a bloated
old man!
Look, son, you are
preaching to the choir.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.188
All right, I led
the petition drive

05:13.230 --> 05:15.149
to try to force him
out of Phoenix.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.357
Hi.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.734
Oh, I didn't even
see you there.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.570
So, any dinner requests?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.031
How about my famous
mac and cheese?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.699
Heavy on the cheese,
light on the mac.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.911
Mmm, sounds good but, uh,
actually, we're about

05:27.953 --> 05:29.288
to go out and watch

05:29.329 --> 05:30.705
some March Madness.
Swish!

05:30.747 --> 05:33.208
Look, don't worry, I know
it's a school night.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.169
We won't be out late.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.546
D-Dixon, aren't you
forgetting something?

05:38.588 --> 05:41.549
Oh, um, bye, Mom.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.468
Peace, Dad.
Hey, uh, peace.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.262
Those two seem to be
getting along well.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.139
Yes, they do.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.482
(rock song plays)

06:04.698 --> 06:06.365
(lowers volume)

06:06.407 --> 06:08.869
Look, again, uh, I gotta say,

06:08.910 --> 06:11.246
I was a coward
with the Jen thing.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.873
Yeah, well, it's over.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.415
No, I know, I just...

06:14.457 --> 06:16.501
I feel like I really
should've just came out and...

06:16.543 --> 06:18.212
Can we talk about
something else?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.297
Like, anything in the world?

06:20.339 --> 06:22.299
Yeah, sure.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.967
Like what?

06:24.009 --> 06:27.595
I don't care, you can
pick the subject.

06:27.637 --> 06:31.432
Hmm... ferrets.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.934
(laughing):
Okay.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.102
Um, that's random.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.771
Well, we just passed
the Beverly Hilton,

06:36.813 --> 06:39.607
which reminded me
of Paris Hilton...

06:39.649 --> 06:43.278
who I think was once caught
with an illegal ferret.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.281
I read the tabloids
in my dentist's office.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.158
ANNIE:
Well, fascinating insight

06:48.200 --> 06:51.619
into that mysterious
brain of yours.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.748
Oh, check out those two.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.167
Whoa, someone's reenacting
Pretty Woman.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.710
(Annie laughs)

06:59.836 --> 07:02.714
Liam, are you okay?

07:04.549 --> 07:07.386
That was my stepdad.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.846
And that wasn't my mom with him.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.351
♪ ♪

07:38.625 --> 07:40.419
Navid said you wanted to see me?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.420
Yeah.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.838
If we're going to
be working together,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.299
I think you owe me an apology.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.051
(chuckles) No, I think you
owe me an apology.

07:48.093 --> 07:52.597
Naomi, you were
insulting and belligerent.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.100
Not exactly the apology
I'm looking for.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.393
It's kind of like

07:56.435 --> 07:57.727
pulling off a Band-Aid:

07:57.769 --> 07:59.813
If you do it really quickly,
it hardly hurts.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.108
Okay.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.652
I'm sorry, but life's too short.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
I'm kicking you
off the Blaze.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.989
What?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.573
You heard me.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.619
Okay, I'm sorry for whatever
it is you think I did wrong.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.706
Ah, let's see, you were
disruptive, rude, irritating...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.334
Fine, fine, I'm sorry
for all of that.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.626
It won't happen again.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.628
You're absolutely right,
it won't.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.090
Please, please,
don't do this.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.883
Okay, I-I finally
found something

08:28.925 --> 08:30.635
that I'm really
passionate about.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.179
And yes, I want
an extracurricular

08:32.220 --> 08:34.306
on my resume for college,
but it's not just that.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.640
I'm good at this.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.267
I'm good on camera,
and I like reporting.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.477
I think it could be something
that I want to pursue.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.981
I mean, Katie Couric's like a
toothy munchkin compared to me.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.483
Please.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.984
Please give me another chance.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.321
I'm sorry,
I've made my decision.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.489
No, what do you want?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.157
Just name it, I'll do anything.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.992
Please, please, please,
I'll do anything.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.998
Are you offering
to sleep with me?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.958
What? No, I...

09:02.000 --> 09:05.003
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.340
Like I said,
you're off the Blaze.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.300
Door's that way.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.845
NAVID:
At the risk of having

09:13.887 --> 09:16.848
our first argument, you are
completely wrong, okay?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.559
Marshall McLuhan like, invented
the term "channel surfing."

09:19.600 --> 09:20.685
He would've definitely
considered

09:20.727 --> 09:22.270
the internet
a cool medium.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.356
It's active, not sedentary.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.691
Okay, what if you use the
internet to watch a movie?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.569
McLuhan considered movies
to be a hot medium.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.321
You know what I think
is really hot?

09:31.363 --> 09:32.489
What?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.075
That you even know who
Marshall McLuhan is.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
Are you kidding me?

09:36.410 --> 09:37.827
Understand Media:
The Extensions of Man

09:37.869 --> 09:40.038
was like my Goodnight, Moon.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.123
That's hot.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.255
Uh, I'll s-see you later.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.297
Yeah.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.888
(clears throat)

09:56.930 --> 09:58.223
You need a hand?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.891
Nope, I have it.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.562
Look, I, uh, I know
it's kind of weird,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.523
you know, your bandmate
dating your ex and...

10:06.565 --> 10:08.024
No, no, no, it's fine.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.068

she has a crush on me.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.526
How did you handle it?

22:40.567 --> 22:43.821
At first, I totally freaked out
and completely avoided her.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.489
And then,

22:45.531 --> 22:46.907
I got over it.

really great connection.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.666

23:04.217 --> 23:07.385
We were watching this
romantic scene in a movie and...

23:07.427 --> 23:09.096
I kind of just stopped
watching the movie

23:09.138 --> 23:10.556

23:10.597 --> 23:12.725

23:12.766 --> 23:15.728

trying to rebound from Navid.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.855
But...

23:17.897 --> 23:19.315
Like, I know I need to move on.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.567
I just didn't think I'd
be moving on with a girl.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.736
Until now.
Crafty!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.196

what do you think?

23:30.534 --> 23:32.370
If I'm having these
feelings for a girl,

23:32.410 --> 23:33.620
does that mean I'm gay?

23:36.582 --> 23:37.541
Well, it's a little gay.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.169
What? It is.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.714
I don't know, I...
I don't think sexuality

23:43.756 --> 23:45.883
is black and white.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.551

um, like a spectrum.

who are 100% gay,

23:49.553 --> 23:50.846
or 100% straight...

23:50.888 --> 23:52.848
Well, that's true. I mean,
gay guys, straight guys,

23:52.890 --> 23:54.267
they all want to
sleep with me.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.103

I think most of us

falling in love with.

have been mistreated by Cannon.

no uncertain terms.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.450
I-I'm going to tell
Harry everything

31:08.492 --> 31:09.618
the minute he gets home.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.454
Are you sure that's a good idea?

31:12.496 --> 31:16.500
Wh-What do you mean?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.460
I mean, I've been
around you two.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.128
There's a little tension.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.588
Look, and jealousy, it's...

31:21.630 --> 31:23.173
it's the number one killer
of relationships.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.634
Believe me, I used to temp
for a divorce lawyer.

31:25.676 --> 31:30.138
But Dana, I think that this
is probably a family matter.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.099
Yeah, yeah.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.853
It's just... family matters
always trickle down

31:35.894 --> 31:37.479
to the kids,
you know, and...

31:37.521 --> 31:40.440
one of your kids
I gave birth to.

31:40.482 --> 31:46.071
Anyways, that's just
my two cents.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.156
You have a great family.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.534
Don't risk it.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.083
(knocking on door)

31:59.668 --> 32:02.379
Hey, picked up a couple more
DVDs on the way over.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.882
But, uh, Sexual Behavior
in the Human Female

32:04.923 --> 32:07.676
seems a lot more interesting.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.010
I'm confused.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.680
Okay.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.974
I mean, if sexuality
is on a spectrum,

32:15.016 --> 32:17.603
does that mean that most people
choose to be straight

32:17.644 --> 32:20.188
because it's what they know
and what they're used to?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.690
Maybe some people do.

32:21.732 --> 32:22.858
What does that mean?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.610
That being gay is a choice?

32:24.651 --> 32:25.736
Because I definitely

32:25.778 --> 32:27.279
don't believe that's true.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.448
I don't think it's a choice
for a lot of people.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.076
As far back as I can remember,
I've liked girls.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.704
But that doesn't mean
that everyone's like that.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.706
Some people

32:37.748 --> 32:39.917
might fall somewhere
in the middle.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.959
That makes sense.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.546
Then again, everything
I'm reading makes sense

32:44.588 --> 32:46.131
until it doesn't
make sense, so...

32:47.507 --> 32:50.803
(sighing)

32:55.599 --> 32:57.476
Why are you reading those?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.561
'Cause...

32:59.603 --> 33:01.104
(chuckling)

33:01.146 --> 33:04.232
Because...

33:04.274 --> 33:05.859
I think I like you.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.989
Look...

33:11.030 --> 33:12.449
whatever you're
struggling with,

33:12.491 --> 33:15.160
I don't think
you're gonna find the answer

33:15.201 --> 33:16.244
in one of these books.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.913
Yeah, no kidding.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.124
So, how do I figure it out?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.629
Well, um...

33:29.257 --> 33:32.678
We could kiss, and,
I don't know...

33:33.887 --> 33:36.055
See how you feel.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.770
Um, yeah. That sounds
like a good idea.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.229
Okay.

33:47.860 --> 33:48.944
Okay.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.339
Good or gross?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.717
Good.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.301
You're a good kisser.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.928
I don't get a lot
of complaints.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.596
(laughing)

34:19.683 --> 34:23.978
But was it, um,
something you liked

34:24.021 --> 34:26.023
and got out of your system?

34:26.063 --> 34:30.527
Or something you liked
and-and want to do again?

34:32.529 --> 34:34.239
Something I wanna do again.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.077
So, what does that mean?

34:39.118 --> 34:41.246
Just that you kind of dig me.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.540
Hmm...

34:43.581 --> 34:47.627
And that if I asked you out on
a date, you'd probably say yes.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.382
So, you wanna go out on a date?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.518
That would be a yes.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.103
(giggles)

35:08.607 --> 35:10.275

You said I was jealous
and I am, okay?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.124
You win.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.710
I tried to tell you, but you
were like, "I can handle this."

36:10.752 --> 36:12.337
Whatever.

36:12.378 --> 36:16.091
I'm sorry,
I just don't get it.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.385
You make this huge play
to be with me and then now

36:19.427 --> 36:21.429
you're just willing
to throw it all away

36:21.471 --> 36:24.474
because I made one incredibly
stupid jealous mistake.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.059
What's going on?

36:26.101 --> 36:28.895
I don't know, I just...

36:28.937 --> 36:32.024
I don't know.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.817
What if it wasn't a mistake?

36:33.859 --> 36:34.985
What if you're right?

36:35.027 --> 36:36.820
What do you mean?

36:36.862 --> 36:39.656
I didn't have to go
to that coffeehouse.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.282
I could've just emailed her,

36:41.324 --> 36:43.660
but instead I left
the door wide open.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.996
Yeah, but nothing happened.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.706
It could have.

36:47.747 --> 36:51.168
Anything could happen
to anyone at any moment.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.502
I'm not just
anyone, Silver.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.922
I'm Spence Montgomery's son.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.425
My dad's had four wives
and cheated on all of them.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.345
You're not your father.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.930
How do you know?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.431
I don't even know.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.101
I've never cared enough about
a girl to stay faithful before.

37:09.853 --> 37:10.896
(rueful chuckle)

37:10.937 --> 37:13.106
But I care about you a lot.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.153
And I'd hate myself
if I ever cheated on you.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.451
I trust you.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.847
(grunts)

37:45.889 --> 37:48.225
(giggling, squealing)

37:48.266 --> 37:50.102
(laughing)

37:55.774 --> 37:57.192
All right, now, I'm warning you,

37:57.234 --> 37:59.652
I'm not really good
with this emotional stuff.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.696
Where you think
you get that from?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.240
It is genetic.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.908
(laughing)

38:04.950 --> 38:07.410
All right, well, I'll call you.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.745
I promise. Every week.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.415
Yeah, and maybe we can Skype
and watch a game together.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.918
Okay, I'm not sure

38:14.960 --> 38:16.253
what that means, but...

38:16.294 --> 38:17.587
sounds like fun.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.799
Oh, I... you know,
I almost forgot.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.930
What's this?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.514
Well, we won the bet.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.267
Yeah, that's your half,

38:30.308 --> 38:32.769
plus a little something extra
to make up for all the missed

38:32.811 --> 38:35.647
birthdays and Christmases and
visits from the tooth fairy.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.690
(chuckles)

38:47.408 --> 38:49.995
Okay, I'll see you, son.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.877
♪ ♪

39:16.771 --> 39:17.897
Hey.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.524
You know where
all my shirts went?

39:19.565 --> 39:21.693
Well, I thought since you're
gonna be staying here

39:21.734 --> 39:24.279
for a little while,
you should have a drawer.
Well, thank you.

39:24.321 --> 39:25.780
But all my drawers were filled,

39:25.822 --> 39:27.740
so I cleared you a space
underneath the bed.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.075
Oh, you are sweet.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.537
Mmm, I like playing house
with you.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.998
Really?
Mm-hmm.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.542
SILVER:
Well, this is a
little awkward.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.501
(giggles)

39:38.543 --> 39:40.670
You watching us?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.672
(chuckles)
Sorry.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.050
Uh, look, we just
want to talk to you

39:45.091 --> 39:46.676
about Mr. Cannon.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.304
Oh, that.
Don't worry, it's all good.

39:49.346 --> 39:52.015
Navid talked to him; he's agreed
to let me back on the Blaze.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.683
Isn't that great?

39:53.725 --> 39:57.478
Yeah, I guess, except
for everything he said.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.563
Nao, that stuff was awful.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.023
Yeah, you really

40:00.065 --> 40:02.400
can't let him get
away with it.
With what?

40:02.441 --> 40:05.237
What'd he say to you?
Oh, uh, it's
nothing, honey.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.364
No, I want to know
what happened.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.782
Cannon told her that she
could be back on the Blaze

40:09.824 --> 40:11.659
if she slept with him.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.661
What?!
It's okay.

40:13.703 --> 40:14.704
I got what I wanted.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.373
So, let's all just
forget about it.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.707
Forget about it?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.417
SILVER: You can't let him
get away with this.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.877
Come on, it's
sexual harassment.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.712
Naomi, come on.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.422
You gotta come forward.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.925
You don't want to be a doormat,
like both of our mothers were.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.473
(phone line ringing)

40:34.515 --> 40:37.227
(recording): This is Liam.
I'll call you back.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.896
Uh, h-hey, it's Annie.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.942
I just wanted to check in and,
uh, see how you're doing.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.903
'Cause we didn't get
a chance to talk earlier.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.197
If you need anything, call me.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.241
Bye.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.201
(chuckling sigh)

40:53.243 --> 40:54.411
(phone ringing)

40:54.452 --> 40:55.412
Hey.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.413
JASPER:
Annie.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.415
Jasper.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.166
Look, I told you
to leave me alone.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.128
All right? What do I have to do
to get that through your head?

41:03.169 --> 41:07.966
Don't worry, I got the
message loud and clear.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.717
I just wanted to say good-bye.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.595
Are you going somewhere?

41:12.637 --> 41:16.266
You could say that.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.935
Listen, if I can't be with you,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.271
there's no point in living.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.772
Bye, Annie.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.316
Jasper, no, don't...

41:24.357 --> 41:25.817
(sighs)
