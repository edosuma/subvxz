00:43.209 --> 00:45.462
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.631
I just wanted really quickly
to say thank you so much for coming

00:48.715 --> 00:51.509
and for sharing
such a perfect evening with us.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.720
It’s been so perfect

00:53.803 --> 00:56.931
that I think the only day
that could possibly rival it

00:57.015 --> 01:01.311
is the one that resulted in all of us
being here in the first place.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.688
And that night was exactly
three years ago today.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.819
And it was on that night that I knew I had
met someone really, really special.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.154
Aw.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.239
It was the night when we first met.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.665
♪ <i>I’m sexy and I know it</i> ♪

01:27.587 --> 01:29.798
♪ <i>I’m sexy and I know it</i> ♪

01:32.342 --> 01:34.219
Excuse me.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.763
Whoa, Black Elvis. It’s a good song.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.892
Oh. Cool. Going to Coachella?

01:41.518 --> 01:44.979
Excuse me. Coming through.
What is she dressed as?

01:45.563 --> 01:47.440
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey, watch it, buddy!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.818
Whoo! Hulk smash!

01:49.901 --> 01:52.487
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God. I think so.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.364
You are <i>A League of Their Own</i>, right?

01:55.490 --> 01:57.450
- Yeah.
- I love that movie.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.661
Okay. What character am I?

01:59.744 --> 02:02.413
I’m getting, like,
a Tom Hanks vibe from you.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.416
- No?
- No. I’m Dottie Hinson.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.335
I’m Geena Davis’s character.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.295
- Okay, that makes more sense.
- Are you my lesbian cousin Shannon?

02:10.380 --> 02:13.508
Yes. I was gonna ask if you wanted
to join my softball team.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.510
- I have a second guess.
- Who?

02:15.593 --> 02:17.053
- Are you Garth?
- Excellent!

02:17.137 --> 02:20.306
You know, the key to doing
a good Garth impression

02:20.390 --> 02:23.309
is to make your mouth
into a tiny little butthole.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.061
That was good.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.690
- Noah.
- I’m Avery.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.567
It’s nice to meet you.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.362
So, what is your favorite drink?

02:34.445 --> 02:38.283
Grapefruit juice with vodka
and three maraschino cherries.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.493
Okay. Where are you from?

02:40.577 --> 02:43.413
All over the place. Kind of an army brat.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.207
I don’t really like that term,
but that’s what they call it.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.794
Well, I was a regular brat,
and I still don’t like that term.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.172
Let’s see it.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.842
Okay, so, it’s a work in progress.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.052
- Okay. All right.
- It’s not totally done.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.971
Ta-da!

03:01.472 --> 03:03.558
- Oh, it’s good!
- You hate it.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.311
It looks drunk, admittedly.

03:06.394 --> 03:09.147
- You’re quite the artist.
- Thank you.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.648
See what’s going on over there

03:10.732 --> 03:13.610
between Sexy Grumpy Cat
and the hipster Where’s Waldo?

03:14.402 --> 03:16.654
Look, they’re gonna fall in...

03:17.697 --> 03:21.242
Oh-ho! Now watch.
Everyone’s gonna jump in.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.161
Let’s party! Whoo!

03:24.579 --> 03:25.997
Whoo!

03:28.583 --> 03:31.628
- Maybe not.
- Wow. Now they’re making out in the pool.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.963
That’s kind of tacky.
Wait. I think I know that guy.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.759
His name is Patric with no “K.”

03:37.842 --> 03:40.094
- That’s a bad name.
- We went on one date.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.389
He literally spent the entire time
teaching me about sea turtles.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.642
Well, at least you know someone here.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.977
I just came with my roommate, Carrie.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.439
And there she is,
making out with Jell-O Shot Doctor.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.151
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

03:58.112 --> 04:00.156
- Do you like jazz?
- Do I like breathing?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.542
God, this place is so awesome.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.044
How’d you find out about it?

04:13.127 --> 04:16.214
Well, I kinda know a guy that works here.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.968
- Ooh!
- It’s me.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.177
- I’m that guy.
- Yeah.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.513
- Did you get that?
- I got that, yeah. Yeah.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.181
Actually, I am the piano man...

04:26.015 --> 04:27.809
who’s got magic hands.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.310
Oh, my God!

04:29.936 --> 04:32.105
- So, is there anything you’d like to hear?
- Mmm.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.399
Do you know any Count Basie?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.651
Whoa! You are a jazz fan.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.611
- I am, mm-hmm.
- Wow. I love Count Basie.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.415
- I’m more of an Oscar Peterson fan.
- Okay.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.865
His friends call him “OP” for short.
Do you know him?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.784
- No.
- He’s dead, so you can’t know him.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.120
Well, I appreciate a guy
who knows his music history.

04:47.203 --> 04:51.666
In that case, sit back and relax
and enjoy this Count Basie classic.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.376

- Oh, my God! New mission!
- What’s up?

05:41.674 --> 05:45.261
Okay, okay. Hey, do not forget
to tip your piano man!

05:45.344 --> 05:46.763
This is gonna be great.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.222
All right.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.767
These things are so much fun.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.560
- Ready? Okay.
- Yep.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.064
- No boring high school yearbook poses.
- What do you mean?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.983
The whole point is to do
something different in every photo.

05:59.067 --> 05:59.942
I’m smiling.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.653
I know this might come as a shock to you,

06:02.737 --> 06:05.448
but I’ve never actually taken
a photo booth photo.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.158
- What?
- Yep. I’m a virgin.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.244
So be gentle with me, please.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.621
- Virgin, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.915
Well, not anymore.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.043
Come on. This is the best part.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.755
- So we just stand out here and wait?
- Shh. Listen.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.010
There’s real film developing in there.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.637
It’s the sound of history.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.814
How we lookin’?

06:37.897 --> 06:40.525
Well, your technique
could definitely use some work.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.943
But you’re cute.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.177
- Hmm?
- Come on. Let’s do it again.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.738
Yeah, okay.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.825
So, this is it.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.495
- Wow.
- Yeah.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.623
Your place is... is incredible.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.625
- Honestly.
- Thanks.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.379
Really? You’ve got one?

07:01.462 --> 07:03.131
Yeah. Why? Do you play?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.008
Oh, do I play?

07:06.092 --> 07:09.637
Oh, you are so dead. I am a master.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.014
- Really? You’re a master. Okay.
- I am. Ready?

07:13.099 --> 07:15.643
- No! Don’t spin it!
- Is that a rule? I’ve never heard that.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.353
Yeah, that is a rule.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.523
- Aah!
- Ohh! Laser!

07:24.110 --> 07:25.695
One step closer.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.618
That’s what you get for cheating. I win.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.620
Whoo! Crowd goes wild!

07:34.704 --> 07:38.124
Mmm. I haven’t had Cookie Crisp
in, like, ten years.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.543
Oh. Best late-night food ever.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.503
- It’s the best.
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.131
So then I got the job at the piano bar,

07:45.214 --> 07:48.593
and the first night playing
was just amazing.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.596
So I dropped out of business school
the next day.

07:50.678 --> 07:54.390
You know what they say. Do what you love,
you’ll never work a day in your life.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.268
Yeah, super-super-poor people say that.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.188
- Can I get you another refresher?
- Yeah.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.191
- Oh. She’s gulping it down.
- A little bit more. Thank you.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.861
Who’s this? Is this your grandma?

08:06.944 --> 08:09.822
Oh, no, that’s actually Dorothy.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.950
She lives at the retirement home
I did a fund-raiser for.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.828
I organize benefits for charities.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.165
So, like kids, the elderly, animals.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.666
You name it, I do it.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.043
Who are you?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.298
♪ <i>You know, you know, you know</i> ♪

08:27.381 --> 08:29.550
♪ <i>That you do</i> ♪

08:31.177 --> 08:32.470
<i>And that was it.</i>

08:32.553 --> 08:35.222
That was the moment
I knew that it was love.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.601
To Ethan and Avery!

08:38.683 --> 08:39.894
Cheers!

08:44.440 --> 08:46.067
Yeah. I’ll take one. Thank you.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.238
Mmm.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.697
I’m gonna need two.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.200
Ah.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.744
Oh, a little boost.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.092
Excuse me.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.595
- I’m gonna go.
- Yeah.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.180
Thank you. I’ll be right back.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.016
It burns!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.644
Hey, Noah!

09:23.604 --> 09:25.982
- Noah?
- Hey.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.609
- Hey, you okay in there?
- Not so good.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.862
My Aunt Cindy said you puked on her
a little bit as you walked by.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.656
She puked on me first.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.075
Okay, I’m coming in.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.286
- Okay?
- Oh, I wish you wouldn’t.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.079
I’m coming in.

09:40.913 --> 09:41.913
Hey.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.125
How are you?

09:45.084 --> 09:47.587
- You dying in here?
- I’m...

09:47.670 --> 09:49.422
I’m... so good.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.173
You hit the open bar too hard.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.883
You think this is about...

09:53.759 --> 09:54.969
drinking?

09:55.052 --> 09:57.263
This was about...

09:57.972 --> 09:59.515
food poisoning.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.600
Taquitos.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.395
Or the seven-layer dip.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.814
Why so many layers? You don’t need seven.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.984
- Ethan.
- Noah. How you feeling, buddy?

10:10.067 --> 10:13.195
Oh, so good. I’m so glad he’s here now.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.615
Got you a Vitaminwater, some saltines.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.368
I got Pepto chewables in the glove box.
Let’s get this stuff in your system.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.579
Mmm, yeah. Thank you.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.662
You are a peach.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.249
Oh. What are these, crackers?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.209
Mm-mm-mmm. Mmm!

10:27.293 --> 10:28.794
- Feel better already.
- Awesome.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.880
Let me know if you need anything else.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.507
- Baby, by the way, that speech?
- Yeah?

10:33.591 --> 10:34.818
- It was beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.029
- Everybody in the room was so moved.
- I was so nervous.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.347
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.564
Also, my parents want to team up for
that Skype call whenever we have a chance.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.775
So, um, just meet me at the laptop?

10:50.858 --> 10:52.568
- Yes. I’ll be right there.
- Okay.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
- Feel better. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.364
Keep your head up.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.490
Okay.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.910
You wanna go
maybe walk around a little bit?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.746
- Just really slowly. Careful, careful.
- I’m fine.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.748
- Okay. Okay.
- These aren’t good.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.458
Candid.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.043
That’s a candid.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.836
Candid.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.923
- Hey, Carrie.
- Hey, hon.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.133
Noah. Haven’t seen you in forever.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.594
- Hey, Carrie.
- I’ve got a shoot tomorrow morning.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.888
So I was wondering,
cool if I can leave a little early?

11:20.971 --> 11:24.892
Maybe you can take Noah home.
He’s a little... He shouldn’t be driving.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.977
- I’m fine.
- Candid.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.648
You don’t look fine. You look like shit.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.734
You know, uh, honestly,
I-I’ll take an Uber.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.361
- Cool.
- Hey, Avery!

11:35.444 --> 11:37.238
Oh. Yeah. One second.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.240
Um, really? Are you sure?

11:39.323 --> 11:41.200
Yeah. I-I’m actually not...

11:41.283 --> 11:43.536
Feel better, okay? Thank you. Bye, Carrie.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.912
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.377
Ooh. That had my Uber on it.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.462
You really are a mess.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.548
All right, fine. Let’s go.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.053
Oh, they’re so beautiful.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.783
Let’s go, train wreck.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.100
Mm-hmm.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.104
You stole an Avery-Ethan plate? You dork.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.982
- Candid!
- You delete that. Okay?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.945
Don’t want any evidence
that this ever happened.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.236
Nope. Sorry.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.448
I photograph weddings for a living.
Capturing misery and regret is what I do.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.992
- Perfect.
- What is your deal tonight anyway?

12:23.075 --> 12:26.412
It’s kind of a long story,
so I’d rather not get into it.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.496
Yeah, okay. Cool.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.749
Oh, you don’t want to hear it?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.170
- Yeah, ’cause I don’t want to tell you.
- Okay.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.810
Fine. I’ll tell you.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.270
All right?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.731
Frickin’ drag it out of me, why don’t you?

12:54.690 --> 12:57.318
It has to do with the fact that I’m...

12:59.361 --> 13:00.946
in love with Avery.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.031
Are you serious?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.867
Why would you go to a party
celebrating their engagement then?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.328
I guess I just wanted to prove
that I could do it,

13:07.411 --> 13:11.624
that I’m not gonna spend my life obsessed
over the fact I missed my shot with her.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.376
- You’re doing great with that so far.
- You know what, Carrie?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.628
I am.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.088
I am, considering the facts,

13:18.172 --> 13:21.217
and I’ll be doing even more better
when I find my...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.135
- Dignity?
- Oop!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.845
Oh!

13:24.929 --> 13:26.472
Jack Daniel’s.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.141
- Okay.
- The nectar of the gods.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.686
You’re a real sad sack of shit right now.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.191
Can I tell you a story?

13:37.274 --> 13:41.278
Has to do with when Avery and I first met.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.364
Just give me the abridged version.

13:44.114 --> 13:47.618
It all started three years
and one day ago.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.371
<i>The year was 2014.</i>

13:50.454 --> 13:53.332
<i>A time filled with hope and dreams.</i>

13:53.415 --> 13:56.293
<i>I can still remember the exact pitch
of her laugh.</i>

13:59.713 --> 14:02.967
<i>- That’s not how it happened.
- I think you’re mistaken.</i>

14:03.050 --> 14:04.885
<i>No, I was at that party.</i>

14:04.969 --> 14:06.845
<i>I was just... preoccupied.</i>

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
<i>Wait. Where are we?</i>

14:08.722 --> 14:11.892
We are at my home, sister.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.520
No, this is a bar. I’m not your...

14:14.603 --> 14:16.188
- Oh, I’m dr...
- Noah, get back in.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.856
Oh!

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
- Je...
- You okay?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.364
- I’m fine.
- Jesus Christ.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.409
- No, I’m not Jesus Christ, I’m Noah.
- Oh. Okay.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.996
- Get in the truck.
- No, I need to keep my buzz going.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.247
Get... Oh!

14:33.330 --> 14:35.207
- I’ll take it.
- Seriously?

14:35.291 --> 14:38.085
Think you should sit down.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.920
Sorry. So sorry.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.172
- There’s my friend Max.
- Noah!

14:42.256 --> 14:45.467
Oh, my God, you are drunk.
Gotta get you some help. Excuse me.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.846
Can we get some ginger whiskey,
a blueberry Red Bull, and who is this?

14:48.929 --> 14:51.891
You didn’t pick up an escort, did you?
You are very lovely.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.101
- Hey, I’m Max.
- And I’m leaving.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.384
I have a photo shoot
in Lafayette Park tomorrow morning.

14:56.437 --> 14:59.940
That’s where I take my wedding photos.
’Cause I am a photographer, not an escort.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.777
What a coincidence, ’cause my office
actually overlooks that park.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.697
Oh, yeah! That big dumb building full
of douche bags.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.741
Yeah. I’m the vice president
of the douche bags.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.702
- You’re obviously in great hands.
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.871
You gotta hear the rest of the story.

15:13.954 --> 15:17.666
’Cause this is the part
that gets truly tragic.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.045
You know when you are about
to fulfill your destiny?

15:21.128 --> 15:24.798
<i>I waited too long, and then I got hugged.</i>

15:31.472 --> 15:33.557
- You’re so awesome.
- Mmm.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.440
Oh, this is so nice to have
a good guy friend, I can’t even tell you.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
<i>I left never knowing
what went wrong.</i>

15:50.532 --> 15:52.117
- Bye!
- Bye.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.496
<i>But I figured I would at least
get a second chance with her.</i>

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
Until fate...

15:58.832 --> 16:01.794
kicked me in my ball sack
the very next day

16:01.877 --> 16:03.587
when she met Ethan.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.633
Can I help you with that?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.102
<i>And you know why
she needed more cereal?</i>

16:18.185 --> 16:22.022
Because I ate all of her Cookie Crisp.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.776
Like a... chubby, nine-year-old slob.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.530
Wow. Your mental recollection
of that moment feels super-accurate.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.157
- Ethan has nothing on you.
- He kinda does.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.160
- He’s, like, the nicest guy ever.
- He’s, like, Mormon nice.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.540
But that night, me and Avery,
we had something, and it was real.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.960
We bonded. We were laughing.
And she said I was cute.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.212
Okay, “cute”? You’re clinging to “cute.”

16:45.295 --> 16:48.716
Noah, my little brother’s cute.
That doesn’t mean I wanna have sex...

16:49.633 --> 16:50.843
I’m not...

16:51.844 --> 16:52.928
You get it.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.723
I get that you have sexual thoughts
about your little brother,

16:55.806 --> 16:58.142
and I also get that you’re mean.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.936
You can tell that I’m in
an emotional state right now.

17:02.312 --> 17:07.443
Noah, relationships are all about energy
and attraction and intangible things,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.403
things beyond your control.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.363
Okay, you may be a great guy,

17:11.446 --> 17:14.032
but you were never gonna
be that guy to Avery.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.785
I just think it’s, you know,
time to move on.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.669
I’ve been telling him for three years.
You have something on your lips.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.040
- Let me get it with mine.
- Does that ever work for you?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.209
- Yes.
- It does, yes.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.296
And with that, Max can take it from here.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.758
Feel better, Noah.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.178
It was lovely meeting you, by the way.
We’ll talk soon, at dinner or something.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.096
- Doubtful.
- She’s right.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.891
Why would Avery ever want to be with me?
Look at me.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.728
Look at me, Maxie. I got a Play-Doh face.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.938
People love your Play-Doh face.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.899
I got a disgusting face.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.609
Noah, I hate seeing you like this.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.821
Let’s get you out of here. On your feet.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.531
Whoo!

17:54.615 --> 17:55.949
Oh! Oh!

17:56.033 --> 17:58.160
Help me help you.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.622
Ooh, here’s a tip.
Here’s a tip from my tip jar.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.792
Don’t fall in love!
She’s gonna rip your heart out!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.502
So sorry about my friend.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.378
You okay? You all right?

18:08.462 --> 18:09.902
- Focus. Focus.
- Where are we going?

18:09.963 --> 18:12.049
I’m gonna go score us a ride.
Just sit tight.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.634
- Um... Okay.
- What are you doing?

18:13.717 --> 18:16.887
I’m... Okay, look...

18:16.970 --> 18:19.598
- I’m sitting tight, baby!
- All right! Sit tight!

18:21.350 --> 18:24.770
Oh. My old friend the photo booth.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.022
Let’s give her a spin.

18:30.651 --> 18:34.029
Yeah, still have these after three years.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.116
You truly are a sad sack of shit.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.125
If only I could have a chance...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.794
to do everything different,

18:48.877 --> 18:51.380
I could be the kind of guy she would want.

18:55.759 --> 19:00.472
I could be exactly the kind of guy
Avery would end up with.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.707
Oh, son of a bitch.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.251
Mmm.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.962
What a crazy dream.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.978
Hey, little witch.
Halloween was two days ago.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.061
Piss off.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.326
What the hell?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.040
Halloween lasts a week now?

20:08.123 --> 20:10.042
It’s good to be a kid today.

20:15.297 --> 20:19.509
All right, 75 cents, your change.
There you are. Thanks.

20:19.593 --> 20:24.765
Could I get a big-ass bottle of Advil
and a blueberry Red Bull, please?

20:24.848 --> 20:25.849
No problem.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.195
Hey, um...

20:41.198 --> 20:44.243
- Could you tell me what day it is?
- It’s Halloween.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.873
Yeah, but, I mean... Halloween...

20:50.666 --> 20:52.709
has definitely already happened, so...

20:55.504 --> 20:56.797
And what year is it?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.717
It’s 2014.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.095
Now, do you need anything else?

21:04.846 --> 21:05.931
Yeah.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.725
Okay, uh...

21:08.809 --> 21:10.060
you know...

21:10.143 --> 21:12.938
could I just get my blueberry Red Bull
so I can get going?

21:13.397 --> 21:16.191
Red Bull doesn’t make
a blueberry flavor though.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.527
Just makes one flavor. Red Bull.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.320
That’s their flavor. Red Bull.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
<i>Red Bull... Red Bull...</i>

21:22.406 --> 21:24.741
Holy shit.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.284
You all right?

21:28.203 --> 21:30.122
Ohh!

21:30.205 --> 21:32.124
Hey, where you going, man?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.674
Max! Excuse me.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.009
Hi.

21:42.092 --> 21:45.095
Hey. Max? No? You know Max?

21:46.013 --> 21:47.347
Max!

21:49.558 --> 21:50.892
Yo. Over here.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.895
Corporate Asset Management.
Please hold.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.648
- I gotta talk.
- And I gotta listen.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.567
But you got 15 seconds, tops.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.153
Something unexplainable
is happening to me, Max.

22:01.236 --> 22:05.365
Look at all these papers. They all
have the exact same date on them.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.701
Where am I?

22:08.827 --> 22:11.580
How did I get here?
What is happening to my life?

22:12.414 --> 22:14.814
Did I not tell you the day
you dropped out of business school

22:14.875 --> 22:16.960
something exactly like this
was gonna happen to you?

22:17.044 --> 22:19.755
- Exactly like what?
- Like a quarter-life crisis.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.006
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

22:21.089 --> 22:24.384
How many times did I tell you I could talk
to my boss and he would offer you a job?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.697
You and I, we’re supposed to be the Anna
and Elsa of the corporate assistant game.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.390
- From <i>Frozen</i> ?
- Max, I need my Diet Sunkist, yeah?

22:30.474 --> 22:31.683
Five minutes ago, dummy.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.978
Of course you can have a playdate at
Julie’s house, sweetie. Go, shit-weasel!

22:35.062 --> 22:37.147
I’m on it, sir. He’s a sweetheart.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.776
But you’re not an assistant.
You’re a vice president.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.486
- Not yet.
- You are though.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.862
Okay, I’m working there.

22:43.945 --> 22:47.407
Costigan assured me that within
three years and an attitude for gratitude,

22:47.491 --> 22:48.408
I’ll be at the top.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.079
I’m investing in myself.
See this watch? Guess how much that cost.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.747
$25,000.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.333
Good guess. Wow, you know quality.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.878
I bought it cash. Well, one percent down.
The rest is on extended layaway.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.589
But it’s a Breitling. It’s so expensive.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.801
Don’t even know how to pronounce it.
Not too much.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.471
I don’t want to be too jacked, but I want
to be able to tell time with ease.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.598
Oh, my God.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.351
It’s her.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.894
That’s good! There you go!

23:15.977 --> 23:17.777
All right, give me a natural one.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.024
Cheese!

23:21.108 --> 23:24.069
You guys are gonna love these
in 30 years. Oh, yeah. Classic.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.029
- Hey! Hey!
- There we go.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.031
Uh, no. Reception’s that way, buddy.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.866
No, you know me.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.494
- Nice try.
- I know that your name is Carrie.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.621
You’re Avery’s best friend.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.290
It was just last night
I was puking in the bathroom.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.668
I almost passed out in your truck.
That truck right there.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.130
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Noah, what are you doing?

23:43.213 --> 23:44.965
- She’s being weird, man.
- I’m so sorry.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.926
You have to excuse my friend.
He gets weird when he’s hitting on chicks.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.387
Wait. Don’t I know you?

23:51.513 --> 23:53.353
From Instagram!
What’s your handle? It’s, um...

23:53.431 --> 23:55.350
- @CarrieGoFYourself.
- Great.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.019
- Mmm.
- No, no, you guys know each other.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.939
It was last night.
We hung out at the piano bar.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.066
Right after Avery’s engagement par...

24:03.150 --> 24:04.151
You guys...

24:05.277 --> 24:09.447
I feel like I’m going crazy right now.
Like, what’s happening? Am I crazy?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.658
- Seriously, dude, she said get lost.
- What?

24:12.659 --> 24:14.494
Okay, weirdo? This is my day.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.580
- I said get lost.
- Wait a second.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.916
If you don’t know me
and you don’t know her,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.376
that means that last night...

24:22.419 --> 24:23.712
just... just didn’t happen.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.965
Which means that...
that tonight didn’t happen.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.342
So I still have a chance to meet her
before she meets him.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.052
And then all that means

24:31.136 --> 24:34.431
is that I just traveled back in time!

24:34.514 --> 24:36.141
Okay, Noah, seriously, stop.

24:36.224 --> 24:39.269
- Don’t do this. You sniffing paint?
- Okay, no.

24:39.352 --> 24:43.398
Listen, I’ll explain it later to everyone.
I’m gonna tell everybody about this.

24:43.481 --> 24:46.026
But right now I have someone to meet.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.236
- I’ll talk to you soon.
- Wait, what do you...?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.863
Oh, my gosh.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.035
What an animal, that one, right? I’m Max.
We can talk about it all over dinner.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.870
- Piss off.
- Okay.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.998
I’ll DM you later, CarrieGoFYourself.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.752

25:27.025 --> 25:30.278
So what would Ethan wear?

25:31.947 --> 25:32.864
Mmm.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.450
Tonight calls for something

25:35.533 --> 25:38.745
a little more... debonair.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.673
Count Basie.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.719
No, I’m good with that, thanks.
See that girl in the basketball jersey?

26:35.802 --> 26:38.471
She was like,
“I’m super into that doctor over there.”

26:38.555 --> 26:39.556
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.435
Figures. I am on it!

26:44.185 --> 26:45.645
Okay.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.609
Hey!

26:51.693 --> 26:53.403
Okay.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.739
- How are you?
- I’ll come back.

26:55.822 --> 26:56.948
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.992
No pressure here.

26:59.075 --> 27:02.120
Just use everything
that you’ve learned about her

27:02.203 --> 27:04.372
to make her fall in love with you.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.083
You’re like a spy, Noah.
You’re like a love spy.

27:07.167 --> 27:11.296
You’re like a sophisticated, charming,
sexy, not-at-all-creepy,

27:11.379 --> 27:12.797

27:12.881 --> 27:15.258

- Whoo!

27:15.342 --> 27:17.218
Hulk smash!

27:18.094 --> 27:19.721
You must be Dottie Hinson.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.598
Yeah.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.559
Ashby.

27:24.642 --> 27:25.769
Noah Ashby.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.646
So, what’s your favorite drink?

27:28.730 --> 27:31.191
Mine is grapefruit juice

27:31.274 --> 27:34.486
with some vodka
and exactly three maraschino cherries.

27:34.569 --> 27:35.987
That’s my favorite drink too.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.614
- That’s insane.
- What?

27:37.697 --> 27:40.075
It’s like we have some sort of...

27:40.158 --> 27:42.369
cosmic connection or something.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.372
I guess that means something.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.373
I don’t know.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.918
You know, I forgot to ask you earlier,
where are you from?

27:50.001 --> 27:51.378
You forgot?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.587
Uh, yeah.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.714
I’m kind of from all over the place.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.591
- Kind of...
- An army brat? Yeah.

27:56.674 --> 27:59.427
I have such an appreciation
for the armed forces.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.388
How did you know I was gonna say that?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.475
Just because your... your demeanor.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.936
And you said that you move around a lot.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.688
So... Oh, my God. Look at this guy.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.732
Hipster Waldo over there.

28:12.816 --> 28:17.195
Oh, my gosh, I think I know him.
His name is Patric.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.697
With no “K.” Yes.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.117
- Yes. You know him too?
- You know...

28:22.200 --> 28:23.660
Oh, my God. They’re gonna fall in.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.705
Oh, you were so spot on.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.541
Now they’re making out in the pool.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.209
- So tacky.
- I know, right?

28:31.292 --> 28:34.587
I ran into him once at this benefit.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.090
Oh, which one? I put on benefits.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.842
Which bene...? Um...

28:39.718 --> 28:42.303
It was a...
Well, which one was it? I go to so many.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.557
It was Kids Without... Toes.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.850
Which is a big one.

28:46.933 --> 28:50.770
They say it’s the harelip
of our generation.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.480
That’s so sad.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.275
These kids, they can’t walk very...

28:55.358 --> 28:57.861
’Cause they don’t have toes, so th-they...

28:57.944 --> 29:00.989
It’s like they have hooves and...
That’s not important.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.659
What is important was,
this guy cornered me about sea turtles.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.161
Sea turtles! Yes!

29:06.244 --> 29:09.122
I was like, “Dude, I get it.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.965
They are our most elegant
oceanic guardians.”

29:11.040 --> 29:13.585
But it’s not about turtles.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.628
It’s about the toes.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.507
Or the lack thereof, in this case.
It’s so sad. It’s so sad.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.487
How do you think tonight’s going?
It’s going pretty good, right?

29:23.511 --> 29:25.680
I feel a good connection here.
Do you like music?

29:25.764 --> 29:28.724
I mean, of course you do. You like
breathing, right? Let’s get out of here.

29:37.233 --> 29:40.278
You know, I’m thinking
you look like a Count Basie fan.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.697
Yeah, he’s my favorite.
How did you know that?

29:42.781 --> 29:45.283
I was just getting
Count Basie vibes from you.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.285
Uh-oh. What’s this hand about to do?

29:47.368 --> 29:49.370
You know this one?

29:49.454 --> 29:50.830
I love this song.

29:52.832 --> 29:55.960
You know his name
actually is William Basie?

29:56.044 --> 29:57.712
Born in Red Bank, New Jersey.

29:57.796 --> 30:02.467
Eventually won nine Grammys for hits such
as “Little Darlin’” and “Corner Pocket.”

30:02.550 --> 30:05.553
Of course, he did die
of pancreatic cancer in 1984.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.598
Those are just a few small facts,
in case you wanted to know.

30:08.681 --> 30:11.392
- You know a lot about Count Basie.
- Hey, I know my music history.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.647
This is great!

30:16.648 --> 30:19.192
- These things are so much fun.
- Okay.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.253
- This is gonna be great.
- Ready for this?

30:21.277 --> 30:23.029
- Yes.
- Pose hard.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.866
Wow, you’re really good at this.

30:26.950 --> 30:30.203
- Have you done this before?
- I’m actually 100 percent self-taught.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.914
- Wow.
- Yeah. I’ve never even had a lesson.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.707
- Really?
- I’m a natural.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.085
- That’s amazing.
- Come on. This is the best part.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.002
Okay.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.546
That one is great.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.508
A lot of first-time photo booth couples
give off an obvious “cute” vibe.

30:43.591 --> 30:45.051
- Mm-hmm. Nope.
- Not us.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.762
Not us. We gave off a real, authentic...

30:47.846 --> 30:50.223
- Sort of natural thing we have between us.
- Oh, sorry.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.954
Drunken text from my roommate Carrie.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.521
She says, “Ugh. Made out with Dr. Douche
and puked from too many Jell-O shots.

30:56.604 --> 31:00.692
Home in two minutes
to come cry in your lap.” Bad night.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.652
- She’s coming here right now?
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.735 --> 31:06.322
Okay, uh, I should... I should actually...
I’m gonna get going, ’cause I’m...

31:06.406 --> 31:08.366
Really? She’s gonna be here
in two seconds.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.160
Okay, uh, do you have
a back door or anything?

31:11.244 --> 31:13.788
I almost forgot.
How do you think tonight went?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.874
If tomorrow you were to meet a tall,

31:15.957 --> 31:18.710
conventionally good-looking,
successful guy,

31:18.793 --> 31:23.006
would this awesome connection we have
still be what you’re most excited about?

31:23.965 --> 31:26.009
- Sorry. What?
- It doesn’t matter.

31:31.472 --> 31:34.350
Avery, you should
put a sock on the door.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.396
- I know you.
- Mm-mmm.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.899
- I know you.
- I don’t know you. You’re a stranger.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.735
No, you’re the freak
at my wedding shoot today.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.528
- Mm-mmm.
- You two know each other?

31:45.612 --> 31:50.199
It’s getting late,
and I feel that alcohol is an issue here.

31:50.283 --> 31:51.284
This one seems...

31:51.367 --> 31:53.494
This is the psycho
I was telling you about!

31:53.578 --> 31:55.496
The one who knew me,
said he was at our house,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.582
claimed to be some sort of
time-traveling nomad

31:57.665 --> 31:59.465
and spent last night
in the back of my Bronco.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.294
Seems like she’s a little...

32:01.377 --> 32:04.005
You didn’t guess I was an army brat.
You already knew that.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.382
- Because you’re a stalker!
- A stalker?

32:06.466 --> 32:07.842
- I knew it!
- I’m not a stalker.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.469
I’m wearing a tuxedo.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.388
Stalkers wear, like, trench coats
and no underwear.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.141
And I am clearly wearing underwear. Look.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.560
- Oh, my God! Get out!
- Rape! Rape!

32:17.644 --> 32:20.396
Rape? Why would you say rape? It’s not r...

32:20.480 --> 32:22.690
- Carrie!
- What we have tonight...

32:22.774 --> 32:23.775
that was cosmic, right?

32:23.858 --> 32:26.152
Don’t touch her, asshole!

32:26.235 --> 32:27.862
“Don’t touch her asshole”?

32:27.946 --> 32:31.908
Yes, Carrie! Hit him! Hit him!

32:31.991 --> 32:33.701
Hit him harder!

32:33.785 --> 32:36.329
Hit him in the balls! Hit him in the dick!

32:42.001 --> 32:44.170
Oh, my God.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.590
Oh.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.409
Whoo.

33:15.201 --> 33:18.287
Oh, looks like today’s apology day.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.045
One sec!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.133
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Hey, man, I just...

33:30.216 --> 33:32.760
I wanted to come by
and apologize for me at the party.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.929
Oh, you’re here for the party. Uh, cool.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.348
Yeah. Come on in.
We’re still setting up, but, uh...

33:37.432 --> 33:39.517
- You’re having another party?
- Grab a drink.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.520
You must be one of Avery’s friends.
Avery, your first guest is here.

33:43.521 --> 33:47.275
So, you guys go to high school
together, or... Wait. Northwestern?

33:47.358 --> 33:49.193
- I’m coming.
- What?

33:50.778 --> 33:51.946
Oh, my God.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.906
Hi.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.783
- Oh, my God.
- What?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.952
You know what? I’m gonna go.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.996
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:02.123 --> 34:03.708
It burns!

34:03.791 --> 34:06.669
It’s him!

34:06.753 --> 34:09.130
- It’s who? Who?
- Carrie!

34:09.213 --> 34:11.382
- It’s who?
- Oh, my God, he’s back!

34:11.466 --> 34:13.301
No, it’s a misunderstanding!

34:16.219 --> 34:18.347
Why do you keep hitting me with trees?

34:18.431 --> 34:21.726
That’s the guy from three years ago!
That’s the stalker from Halloween!

34:21.809 --> 34:23.186
That’s the stalker?

34:27.982 --> 34:31.402
You don’t understand.
We’re old friends, Ethan!

34:31.485 --> 34:33.196
How do you know my name?

34:33.279 --> 34:35.782
How do you know my name, stalker?

34:35.864 --> 34:38.159
You’re right. I am a stalker.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.120
A-And I’m crazy, and I’ve got a bomb.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.831
- He’s got a bomb.
- You’re right! I’ve got a bomb!

34:44.916 --> 34:46.292
I’ve got a bomb!

34:46.375 --> 34:49.670
I-It’s fine. I’m sorry my bomb threat
ruined your magical evening.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.547
Have a great life.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.677
Yeah? You’d better come back
with more than a bomb next time, pal!

34:56.761 --> 34:59.097
Ethan! <i>Less</i> than a bomb.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.641
Less than a bomb!

35:09.440 --> 35:11.192
Okay.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.319
So, you woke up here.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.154
How did you get here?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.574
Look for clues.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.123
Okay.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.335
Peppermint patty. ChapStick.

35:32.463 --> 35:33.881
A receipt?

35:34.549 --> 35:36.843
For the peppermint patty
and the ChapStick.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.477
Oh, my God.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.855
The photo booth.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.525
- Oh, shit. Sorry.
- Dude!

35:53.693 --> 35:56.279
- What kind of car do you drive?
- An Impreza. Why?

35:56.362 --> 35:59.991
Yeah, that’s the one. It’s getting towed
right now, so you have time. Save it.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.826
That’s my mom’s car.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.661
Well, your mom has a sick whip.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.664
All right, come on.

36:06.747 --> 36:11.711
Come on. Take me.
Take me, take me, take me.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.966
Take me, take me...

36:21.762 --> 36:24.098
Holy shit.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.351
Oh, I owned your ass,
space-time continuum.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.229
I traveled through time.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.565
- Max?
<i>- Yo. What up?</i>

36:32.648 --> 36:34.066
Hey, what’s up, man?

36:34.150 --> 36:36.611
Uh, I know you got
a big date tonight, but...

36:37.445 --> 36:38.863
I need your help.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.285
Nope, that is not what I wanted to do.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.203
<i>Hello?</i>

36:45.286 --> 36:48.664
Yeah. Hey, sorry. I don’t know why
I hung up, but I do need your help.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.000
Uh, there’s this girl.
Her name’s Avery, and...

36:52.543 --> 36:55.463
We are already so late.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.133
What if she meets another guy
before I have a chance to get there?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.385
What are you talking about, bro?
It’s gonna be fine.

37:01.469 --> 37:05.223
And listen, I’m the one who had to cancel
on Carla, JC Penney underwear model.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.141
Intimates, bro. She’s got an old soul.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.561
Okay, dude, I’m serious.
You get more girls than any guy I know.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.813
- I need your help.
- You look good. Great start.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.983
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you loaning me your shirt.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.694
But I don’t know, man. I have...

37:19.695 --> 37:21.822
I have leather strips in my armpits.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.407
- This isn’t me.
- Exactly.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.576
’Cause Noah doesn’t get
that caliber of a girl.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.205
You gotta dress the part.
You gotta be ahead of the curve, bro.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.249
You gotta feel it. Look at me.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.797
“Man, what’s up, girl?” Try that.

37:37.880 --> 37:41.842
So something’s funny off in the distance,
I squint, lick my lips and look at her?

37:41.926 --> 37:44.178
And you bring the attention back to her.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.472
This is stupid.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.517
It’s great.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.065
- Are you doing a Joker impersonation?
- No, this is like...

37:56.148 --> 37:57.817
- It was good.
- That was... Okay.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.318
Did you think that was bad?

37:59.402 --> 38:01.320
I’ll do it one more time.
Follow what I do.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.533
What’s up, girl?

38:10.037 --> 38:12.456
- What’s up, girl?
- Um, w-we’ll work on that.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.626
You need a triple-A plan:
assertive, ambitious, asshole.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.713
There’s something about confidence
that a girl just loves.

38:18.796 --> 38:19.796
They smell it.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.841
Girls are attracted to guys
who know what they want

38:21.924 --> 38:24.135
and aren’t afraid to go for it,
which usually isn’t you.

38:24.218 --> 38:27.596
And I don’t like this part,
but if all else fails, be an asshole.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.766
- Be an asshole?
- Yeah. Not hard asshole. Soft asshole.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.937
- I gotta be a soft asshole.
- Let me hear a soft asshole kind of dis.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.940
Your... Your goatee’s...

38:38.024 --> 38:40.109
It... It’s stupid. I’ve never liked it.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.361
Okay, wait.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.406
You have beady little satanic eyes.

38:45.489 --> 38:49.118
Wow. That makes me doubt myself,
but in a sexy kind of way.

38:49.201 --> 38:52.913
’Cause girls can’t resist a guy
that makes ’em feel bad at first.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.958
What are the three A’s?

38:56.042 --> 38:58.586
Assertive, ambitious, asshole.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.546
Soft asshole.

39:00.629 --> 39:03.233
- Keep the shoulders down. Let’s do this.
- Triple-A. Always there.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.484
♪ <i>Let’s go</i> ♪

39:04.508 --> 39:06.594
♪ <i>Give it to me, baby</i>
<i>Do it how you do it, yeah</i> ♪

39:06.677 --> 39:08.929
♪ <i>It’s a party</i>
<i>We can do it like it’s New Year’s</i> ♪

39:09.013 --> 39:10.473
Arr, matey. Hey.

39:10.556 --> 39:11.766
Don’t talk to him.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.062
No, she’s not in here.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.482
- I’m gonna go check outside again.
- No, no, no. You’re gonna stay here.

39:19.565 --> 39:23.611
Be cool. Don’t make it seem like you’re
chasing after her. Don’t be a stalker.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.197
Oh, shit. There she is.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.950
I was supposed to stop that drunk
Hulk asshole from bumping into her.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.994
I blew it. Great.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.914
It’s not over. Okay? Maxie steps in now.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.582
I’m gonna distract her friend,

39:36.665 --> 39:39.085
the basketball player
that doesn’t know how to swim.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.170
No, she’s a Dunkin’ Donut.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.422
Oh! That’s good!

39:43.506 --> 39:44.882
Yeah, it’s pretty good.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.634
Anyways, look, engage your girl.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.011
Bring up her ex. Girls hate that.

39:49.095 --> 39:50.554
Stay close.

39:52.014 --> 39:55.184
Ooh! Can I talk to you privately
about something in private?

39:55.267 --> 39:58.354
- Uh, about what?
- We’re gonna get her a club soda first.

39:58.437 --> 40:01.357
And then I’ll talk to you
about the private stuff.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.441
That’s clever.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.991
Mmm!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.743
I like that jersey.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.037
And I am not afraid to tell you that.

40:15.121 --> 40:18.791
Yeah, I liked it a lot too
until the Hulk smashed it.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.504
- I think it looks really good.
- Thanks.

40:28.175 --> 40:30.845
What, are you, like,
dressed as a tranny or something?

40:33.556 --> 40:36.392
No! No. I-It’s from a movie.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.436
That’s cute.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.564
Yeah, I don’t really dig costumes.
That’s why I kinda...

40:41.647 --> 40:45.276
You came as nothing,
which is really endearing.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.654
- Okay, bye.
- No! Wait, uh...

40:48.737 --> 40:50.739
I’m gonna get you a drink. Okay?

40:53.451 --> 40:56.328
- Two beers, please.
- Hey, this one? Total marathon.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.123
But the stripper out front?
Sprint. My speed. Know what I’m sayin’?

40:59.206 --> 41:01.542
Yep. Okay, thank you very much,
Bill Cosby.

41:01.625 --> 41:05.337
But before you go, make her earn it.
Don’t just give it to her.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.551
Yo, what’s up? Me again.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.428
So, this’ll be fun.

41:12.511 --> 41:15.639
You tell me something about yourself,
and if I find it interesting...

41:17.099 --> 41:19.810
Ding! I’m-a give you a beer.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.938
- What?
- Are you deaf? You couldn’t hear that?

41:23.022 --> 41:25.608
You know, I think I figured out
who you are.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.318
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:27.401 --> 41:30.279
You are a giant,
human being-sized asshole.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.364
Thank you for the beer.
Have a great night.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.662
Wait. Okay, wait.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.289
- Be back, girl.
- Mm-hmm.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.586
- Hey, where you going?
- Anywhere that you aren’t gonna be.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.175
Ew. I hate it when girls are this into me.

41:51.258 --> 41:54.470
And please, do me a favor.
Don’t talk to me like your ex-boyfriend.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.763
I’m not.

41:55.846 --> 41:59.391
If he talked to me the way you’re talking
to me, I would punch him in the face.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.185
- You would?
- But you’re a total stranger.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.646
So I could probably kill you
and get away with it.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.023
- Go ahead. Shank me.
- God, I wish I could.

42:06.106 --> 42:07.191
- Do it.
- Okay, I will.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.734
- I don’t believe you.
- Okay.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.152
Whoa!

42:13.822 --> 42:16.450
Great. Yep.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.827
Yes, I’m fine. Thank you. How’d it feel?

42:18.911 --> 42:21.413
That felt really great, actually.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.415
- Can you at least help me out?
- Fine.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.168
Here. Take my hand. I’ll help you...

42:29.004 --> 42:31.257
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

42:31.340 --> 42:33.133
What the hell!

42:33.217 --> 42:35.386
Whoo. Whoo!

42:35.469 --> 42:38.430
- You dick!
- I’m the dick? How am I the dick?

42:38.514 --> 42:41.350
- You’re the one who pushed me in.
- You told me to push you in!

42:41.433 --> 42:44.687
I told you to shank me in the ribs
for emotional closure.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.814
- You’re the worst.
- <i>You’re</i> the worst!

42:47.690 --> 42:50.067
- <i>You’re</i> the worst.
- No, you’re the worst.

42:58.450 --> 43:01.161
Now we’re the people at the party
that make out in the pool.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.247
I don’t care.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.293
- You’re the worst.
- Okay, here we go.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.836
Okay. Yeah.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.843
You know what?
I’m gonna put a sock on the door.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.428
No, wait. Here, just...

43:21.765 --> 43:24.643
Here. Okay. Bedroom’s this way. Let’s go.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.690
Oh, not today, tree.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.424
Oh-ho!

43:55.507 --> 43:57.176
Oh, my God.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.179
Twice. Okay.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.765
Very good.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.396
- Mmm.
- What are you doing?

44:11.148 --> 44:12.650
Being the big spoon.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.364
Since when do we spoon?

44:19.948 --> 44:23.869
Since we started dating
and fell madly in love.

44:28.123 --> 44:31.377
What are you still doing here?
You hate sleeping over.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.253
Okay, what’s going on here?

44:33.921 --> 44:36.674
God, please.
You were not that drunk last night.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.469
Remember? I texted you at midnight.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.764
Had a shit day at work
and my mother was harassing me

44:43.847 --> 44:45.974
about when I’m gonna finally find
a decent dude.

44:46.058 --> 44:49.061
Which isn’t gonna happen
if you and I keep doing this shit.

44:51.605 --> 44:55.150
If you weren’t so good at sex,
this would have ended a long time ago.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.654
Wait, what’s that?

44:58.737 --> 45:00.697
We’re good at sex with each...?

45:00.781 --> 45:03.283
Oh. Yeah. Okay, that’s cool.

45:03.367 --> 45:07.621
Okay, on the count of three, what is,
like, our favorite position, sexually?

45:07.704 --> 45:11.125
One, two, three.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.460
Is it doggie style?

45:13.544 --> 45:15.087
Is that our favorite?

45:15.170 --> 45:18.799
Can you just get dressed? ’Cause I’m
busy today. You really can’t stay here.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.301
Yes, I will get dressed.

45:21.385 --> 45:25.139
But did you want to have
morning sex real quick?

45:25.222 --> 45:27.349
- Just to get the day started?
- Here.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.476
Don’t forget your, uh, leather pants.

45:37.317 --> 45:40.195
Oh, my God.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.197
I went full asshole.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.749
Oh, great, it’s you.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.543
Oh, great, you.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.462
What the hell is...? Hey, what’s up?

45:56.545 --> 45:58.088
Why are you...? Why’s he here?

45:58.172 --> 46:00.090
Hey, man. Uh, Noah, right? Yeah.

46:00.174 --> 46:01.175
That’s right.

46:01.258 --> 46:04.011
- Haven’t seen you around. How’s it going?
- Mm-hmm. It’s going...

46:04.094 --> 46:06.180
How does he...? How do you know Avery?

46:06.263 --> 46:09.099
Uh, we’re her friends,
which is more than you can say.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.944
Why don’t you take your frosted tips,
get on your “douche bag-mobile.”

46:11.977 --> 46:12.977
We’d all appreciate it.

46:14.021 --> 46:15.689
Oh, my God.

46:16.315 --> 46:19.526
- That’s what I drive now?
- Oh, I see what he’s doing.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.028
Awesome.

46:21.111 --> 46:23.697
Sorry to keep you waiting. I’m ready.
Oh, thank you.

46:23.781 --> 46:27.910
What are we doing? We CrossFitting?
Pilates? Hot yoga? I’m down.

46:27.993 --> 46:31.663
Just a little park run today, actually.
That is, if Carrie can keep up.

46:34.750 --> 46:38.337
Yeah, if Carrie can... That’s... You are...
Ethan’s funny.

46:38.420 --> 46:41.965
You know, I was just actually saying
to a personal friend of mine

46:42.049 --> 46:44.301
that I don’t run in a park setting enough.

46:44.384 --> 46:45.511
So I’ll join you guys.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.387
Oh, okay.

46:47.471 --> 46:48.972
- Come on.
- All right. Whoo!

46:49.056 --> 46:51.808
Let’s go. Let’s go. A-let’s go.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.519
Come on. All right.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.397
Uh... Good one, Noah.

47:13.413 --> 47:16.458
Oh, God. Oh.
These pants are not breathable.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.836
Ethan, you’re barely sweating.

47:21.380 --> 47:24.800
Yo. Yo. Hey, Ethan.

47:24.883 --> 47:28.011
I’m thinking we should get
to know each other a little better, right?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.846
You’re probably married with kids now?

47:29.930 --> 47:32.391
Uh, single.
Actually, just got out of a relationship.

47:32.849 --> 47:34.726
You and Stacy broke up. I’m so sorry.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.521
Man, she... she seemed like the one.
That’s too bad.

47:39.314 --> 47:40.899
Are you okay?

47:40.983 --> 47:43.193
We can slow down
or take a break if you need to.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.037
I don’t need a break.
You might need a break.

47:45.112 --> 47:48.407
In fact, I was thinking let’s...
let’s get physical! Yeah!

47:48.490 --> 47:50.617
Okay. Diggin’ the energy. Let’s go.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.620
All right. Now we’re talking.
Let’s, uh, hurdle this thing.

47:54.204 --> 47:56.582
Whoo. Yeah.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.834
Good idea, Noah. Try some harder ones.

47:58.917 --> 48:01.003
We’re going harder.
We’re gonna do a harder one.

48:01.086 --> 48:02.963
Yeah, okay. All right!

48:03.046 --> 48:04.548
Watch the ankles.

48:04.631 --> 48:05.631
Okay.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.426
Here we go. Whoo!

48:07.509 --> 48:08.802
Yeah.

48:08.885 --> 48:11.054
Aaah. Aaah!

48:11.138 --> 48:13.640
- Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!
- Right behind you.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.352
Ethan, you have so much energy.

48:18.854 --> 48:21.148
- Stepping it up on this one.
- All right.

48:22.232 --> 48:23.984
- Whoo!
- Yep.

48:26.111 --> 48:27.529
Oh!

48:28.113 --> 48:29.698
Oh!

48:29.781 --> 48:31.450
Yeah. Oh, that hurt.

48:31.533 --> 48:32.868
Oh, yeah.

48:32.951 --> 48:35.120
Oh, I think I’m gonna need
some face stitches.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.664
Are you sure?
Just looks like a little scrape.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.626
I-I feel like it’s...
it’s worse than just a scrape.

48:40.709 --> 48:44.421
I think you and Carrie should just
go ahead without me, and Avery and I...

48:44.504 --> 48:45.714
Actually, it’s not that bad.

48:45.797 --> 48:49.176
If you guys wanna keep going,
I have a first aid kit in my truck.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.470
- I’ll make sure he doesn’t bleed out.
- Okay.

48:51.553 --> 48:53.138
Thanks, Carrie. Feel better, all right?

48:53.221 --> 48:54.848
- Yeah, feel better.
- Ice it.

48:55.724 --> 48:57.434
- Okay.
- Thank you.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.353
Come on.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.647
Look. Look what’s happening. Right now.

49:01.730 --> 49:05.150
She’s escaping with him, and she...
she hates me.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.818
She doesn’t “hate you” hate you.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.942
You’re one of those guys
girls sleep with sometimes,

49:08.987 --> 49:10.781
and as a result,
we wind up hating ourselves.

49:10.864 --> 49:12.991
Okay. What can I do to change that?

49:13.784 --> 49:15.827
You’re the guy
who strolls in for a quickie,

49:15.911 --> 49:17.329
then you disappear for two months.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.997
What?

49:19.081 --> 49:21.750
I have no control over any of this.

49:21.833 --> 49:25.462
I make a decision, and then I wake up
three years later with the consequences.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.409
Way to take responsibility, pal.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.634
Oh, hey, look.
Look, look, look, look, look.

49:30.717 --> 49:33.887
I’m just trying to be the type of guy
that Avery would want to be with.

49:36.598 --> 49:38.308
Noah, if you’re screwing with me,

49:38.392 --> 49:40.560
I will cut your nuts off
and wear them as earrings.

49:40.644 --> 49:43.397
Carrie, I am being 100 percent real.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.314
Candid.

49:45.691 --> 49:47.275
You look like shit.

49:51.905 --> 49:54.199
So you’re saying
you’re in love with Avery?

49:55.158 --> 49:56.702
No, dude, just no.

49:57.536 --> 49:59.413
What do you mean, “No, just no”?

50:00.122 --> 50:03.208
Okay, all due respect, I’m pretty sure
the closest you’ve been to love

50:03.291 --> 50:05.752
is taking photos of strangers at weddings.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.213
Oh, yeah? Well, you drink coffee
with whipped cream in it,

50:08.296 --> 50:10.215
so I can’t take
anything you say seriously.

50:12.467 --> 50:14.052
It’s comforting me.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.930
And I know emotions don’t penetrate you,

50:17.013 --> 50:19.057
so you wouldn’t understand how this feels.

50:19.141 --> 50:21.518
It’s not like I’ve never had
my heart broken before.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.228
Well, I have a hard time believing that,

50:23.311 --> 50:26.189
because every time we’ve talked,
you’ve been pretty impenetrable.

50:26.690 --> 50:27.607
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.318
Because this is easily
the longest conversation we’ve ever had.

50:32.028 --> 50:33.655
Let’s just say I learned to...

50:33.739 --> 50:34.948
What, move on?

50:36.074 --> 50:37.534
Yeah. Something like that.

50:37.617 --> 50:41.705
I mean, there has to be a way that
I could prove I’m as good as Ethan is.

50:41.788 --> 50:43.373
Those two are just buds.

50:43.457 --> 50:44.875
Right. Yeah, buds.

50:44.958 --> 50:48.170
Because I’ve been love-blocking them
since the second we met.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.671
They’re like love magnets,

50:49.755 --> 50:52.507
and no matter what happens,
they’re gonna smash into each other

50:52.591 --> 50:54.801
over and over and over and over.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.304
Okay, I get it.
You’re extremely threatened by Ethan.

50:57.387 --> 50:58.680
He’s stable, he’s secure.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.308
As long as I’ve known Avery,
she’s been driven,

51:01.391 --> 51:04.561
but, yeah, she wants the home
with the white picket fence, family.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.105
She’s a sucker for all that.
It’s not really my thing.

51:07.189 --> 51:09.274
You’re absolutely right. Yes.

51:09.941 --> 51:11.985
I have to be that guy.

51:12.068 --> 51:14.905
It makes... It makes perfect sense.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.948
She wants someone to build a future with,

51:17.032 --> 51:19.242
and that’s what Ethan can give her
that I can’t.

51:21.286 --> 51:22.287
Yet.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.624
I could totally be that guy.

51:25.707 --> 51:27.626
I went to business school,
for Christ’s sake.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.548
Okay, Avery. You want something different?

51:33.632 --> 51:36.760
I understand. Well, I’m about to be
the man of your dreams.

51:41.264 --> 51:43.225
Come on. Let’s go.

51:44.392 --> 51:45.602
I’m ready.

51:53.777 --> 51:55.403
Okay.

51:56.696 --> 51:58.281
Yes.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.575
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

52:03.411 --> 52:04.538
Perfect.

52:04.621 --> 52:05.622
Max?

52:06.289 --> 52:07.874
I’m here for a job, my man.

52:10.627 --> 52:11.795
You gorgeous son of a bitch.

52:11.878 --> 52:13.296
Get in here, bro.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.550
Yes. I’m so proud of you.
I’ve been waiting for this so long.

52:16.633 --> 52:18.718
Me and you are gonna run this place
together someday.

52:18.802 --> 52:20.470
- I hope so.
- Max.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.514
Go get my lettuce cups already.

52:22.597 --> 52:24.724
All right. Right away, sir.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.643
Okay, no. You handle the mail.

52:26.726 --> 52:29.688
Turn in my résumé.
I’ll go get the lettuce cups, okay?

52:29.771 --> 52:30.981
All right. Thanks, buddy.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.484
Also, real quick. What are lettuce cups?

52:34.568 --> 52:36.403
Uh, it’s lettuce
but in the shape of a cup.

52:36.486 --> 52:37.696
Okay.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.406
No, no Hulk smashing.

52:39.489 --> 52:41.032
- Hulk smash.
- No more smashing.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.410
Hulk sitting. That’s what Hulkie's doing.

52:43.994 --> 52:47.163
Okay, let’s get this good stuff in ya.

52:47.831 --> 52:52.002
Let’s get you hydrated before you barrel
into a crowd full of innocent strangers.

52:52.085 --> 52:53.420
Okay? There you go.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.422
- Hulk drink.
- Yes, Hulk drink.

52:55.505 --> 52:57.299
Good Hulk. Doing good, Hulk.

52:57.966 --> 53:01.595
There he is.
Best costume of the party award.

53:01.678 --> 53:04.097
Angus Young? AC/DC?

53:04.180 --> 53:07.142
You just made my night complete.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.769
Thank you so much.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.772
For those about to rock,

53:12.856 --> 53:14.733
we salute you.

53:15.775 --> 53:19.613
Thank you so much for this.
Best Halloween ever!

53:19.696 --> 53:21.990
Yes, it is.
Oh, you’re still doing that walk.

53:22.866 --> 53:24.075
Very good. Right?

53:24.159 --> 53:26.912
So this is all anyone really wants, right?

53:26.995 --> 53:29.581
Someone to support and take care of them.

53:30.081 --> 53:33.376
Someone secure who’s also, like...
like a mythically nice person

53:33.460 --> 53:35.879
to be the rock in their time of need.

53:35.962 --> 53:36.796
Right?

53:36.880 --> 53:39.080
There she is.
There’s that girl I was telling you about.

53:44.346 --> 53:45.555
Dottie Hinson.

53:45.639 --> 53:48.266
They’re calling your name. You’re on deck.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.018
- Oh, am I?
- Mm-hmm.

53:50.101 --> 53:53.772
You are a patriotic toddler?

53:53.855 --> 53:55.482
I am the American dream.

53:58.693 --> 53:59.819
Are you?

53:59.903 --> 54:01.488
- Okay. I like that.
- Hey.

54:02.238 --> 54:05.533
Do you wanna hang out
and then get a house in the suburbs,

54:05.617 --> 54:08.244
adopt a golden retriever,
have 2.8 kids together?

54:08.328 --> 54:11.039
I mean, I do like dogs.

54:11.122 --> 54:14.250
- Maybe we should get a drink first.
- That’s probably a good place to start.

54:14.334 --> 54:15.334
Yeah.

54:22.509 --> 54:23.760
Excuse me.

54:23.843 --> 54:25.887
- Garçon.
- Hey, Noah.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.723
We’d like to order
your most expensive bottle of wine.

54:28.807 --> 54:31.351
- Ooh, you’re fancy.
- Mm-hmm.

54:31.434 --> 54:33.311
Noah, that’s a $500 bottle of wine, dude.

54:37.273 --> 54:41.861
Then we would like your most
reasonably priced bottle of wine.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.822
So $95?

54:47.117 --> 54:49.160
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.371
- That’s perfect.
- Coming right up.

54:51.454 --> 54:53.456
This is really nice.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.292
- You just think this is “nice”?
- Yeah.

54:56.376 --> 54:59.421
This is gonna be one of the best nights
of your life.

54:59.504 --> 55:01.172
I can deal with best night of my life.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.425
And it’s starting right now.

55:06.886 --> 55:08.013
Whoo!

55:08.096 --> 55:09.097
Thank you.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.432
All right. That was good.

55:11.933 --> 55:14.936
Right now we’re gonna dedicate
this next tune to my main man, Noah,

55:15.020 --> 55:17.897
and his beautiful,
lovely new lady friend, Avery.

55:19.524 --> 55:20.984
- How did he know your name?
- Noah.

55:21.067 --> 55:24.070
- What did you do?
- We’re gonna miss you around here, bro.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.823
This entire evening is dedicated to you.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.328
- You like Count Basie?
- I do. I love him.

55:32.412 --> 55:35.623
Luckily,
that’s basically all that Danny knows.

55:35.707 --> 55:39.502
So what did he mean when he said
that they’re gonna miss you?

55:40.003 --> 55:42.505
- I used to work here.
- Oh, you did?

55:42.589 --> 55:44.674
Yeah, that piano bench right there,

55:44.758 --> 55:48.511
it’s still warm to the touch
from my butt cheeks.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.682
I got a hot butt.
I don’t know if you know that or not.

55:52.766 --> 55:55.101
- No, not yet.
- You check it out?

55:55.185 --> 55:58.313
Why would you quit though?
This place is amazing.

55:58.396 --> 56:01.649
I’m just taking
an extended leave of absence

56:01.733 --> 56:03.777
to live a more grown-up life.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.695
Oh. So, like, boring?

56:05.779 --> 56:08.239
I’m wearing
a red, white and blue onesie right now.

56:08.323 --> 56:11.659
Do I look like the kind of guy
that would aspire to live a boring life?

56:13.119 --> 56:14.954
No.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.247
Very not boring.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.439
What the hell?

56:43.358 --> 56:44.400
What?

56:44.484 --> 56:45.777
What, am I fat?

56:46.569 --> 56:49.155
I’m fat now. Great. I’m fat now.

56:49.864 --> 56:51.199
Great, I’m fat!

56:51.783 --> 56:53.576
This is all working out, isn’t it?

57:00.625 --> 57:02.627
Ohh...

57:04.212 --> 57:06.464
It’s comfort weight.

57:12.512 --> 57:13.513
Oh!

57:13.596 --> 57:16.433
Noah, you’re a boss.

57:16.516 --> 57:18.184
You have arrived.

57:19.102 --> 57:20.395
Hi, Mr. Noah.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.648
Hey, babe, you’re up.

57:23.731 --> 57:25.483
I’m way up. I am so up.

57:25.567 --> 57:27.068
I missed you last night.

57:27.152 --> 57:30.155
Oh, that is so, so good to hear.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.157
Mmm.

57:34.534 --> 57:36.911
- You want some breakfast?
- I would love some.

57:36.995 --> 57:37.995
Okay.

57:38.913 --> 57:40.165
Oh.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.500
I love our house. It’s awesome.

57:42.584 --> 57:45.170
It’s large, you know, yet kind of cozy.

57:45.253 --> 57:48.631
And obviously I’m wealthy, but this is
tastefully decorated. It’s not gaudy.

57:48.715 --> 57:50.967
Are you okay? You’re acting weird.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.386
Oh, I’m okay. I’ve never felt better.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.472
Oh, I almost forgot.

57:57.223 --> 57:59.893
Look what came
just in time for the party tonight.

58:00.560 --> 58:01.561
Okay.

58:03.730 --> 58:06.608
What do you think? Too cheesy?

58:08.818 --> 58:11.154
That is the most beautiful plate
I’ve ever seen.

58:11.237 --> 58:14.240
I love it. You’re big-spooning me.
It’s perfect.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.701
And I love the message too. “Forever”?

58:16.784 --> 58:19.954
Oh, my God! Look at this ring!

58:20.038 --> 58:22.040
Oh, what?

58:22.540 --> 58:23.625
I’m, like...

58:24.125 --> 58:25.710
I’m a rich dude.

58:25.793 --> 58:28.296
- I know.
- Oh, I am good to you, huh?

58:28.379 --> 58:29.631
- Come in here.
- Okay.

58:29.714 --> 58:31.341
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

58:31.424 --> 58:33.885
Oh, come on. Mom! Dad!

58:35.470 --> 58:37.889
Carrie. What are you doing here?

58:37.972 --> 58:41.100
Well, I’m not trying to win house guest
of the year or anything,

58:41.184 --> 58:43.394
but I did pick up your engagement photos
from the lab.

58:43.478 --> 58:45.688
- Ooh.
- She’s a... You’re a house guest.

58:45.772 --> 58:48.942
She lives here with us.
You’re our house guest. Okay.

58:49.025 --> 58:50.026
Oh, well...

58:51.194 --> 58:52.820
not for very long.

58:52.904 --> 58:53.738
Okay.

58:53.821 --> 58:56.950
I kind of have some really,
really exciting news.

58:57.033 --> 58:59.536
Not to one-up you,
but my gallery showing was last night,

58:59.619 --> 59:02.997
and I sold my entire collection of photos.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.541
- That is so exciting.
- Wow.

59:04.624 --> 59:06.292
- Congratulations.
- That is huge.

59:06.376 --> 59:07.544
What will I do without you?

59:07.627 --> 59:10.672
This house gets so creepy
when Noah’s traveling and I’m home alone.

59:10.755 --> 59:12.966
What? No.

59:13.049 --> 59:14.801
No, it’s not creepy.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.928
And no one’s gonna feel alone.
Not in this house.

59:17.011 --> 59:19.681
You know what?
You could stay here as long as you want.

59:19.764 --> 59:21.599
If it makes Avery happy,
it makes me happy.

59:22.684 --> 59:25.687
Mmm! Goddamn, that coffee is good!

59:32.068 --> 59:34.904
Oh, my God.

59:36.155 --> 59:38.908
This is my favorite car.
This is my, like, all-time fav...

59:38.992 --> 59:41.286
Of course I would have this car.
It makes perfect sense.

59:41.995 --> 59:43.246
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

59:47.584 --> 59:50.587
Uh-oh, that dog’s barkin’.
That dog is a-barkin’.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.839
Right.

59:52.922 --> 59:55.258
So you’re gonna be home
on time today, right?

59:55.341 --> 59:57.927
For the party? Of course. Yes.
I’m excited.

59:58.011 --> 59:59.554
- This is a big deal for us.
- Yeah.

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:02.261
Let’s make some memories. Right?

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.310
Sorry about this. 7:30 in the morning.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.604
Yeah, here. Don’t forget this one.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.981
- You left it on your nightstand.
- I have two phones.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.190
I know.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.043
No, decli... All right.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.861
- Now this one. Okay.
<i>- Incoming call from...</i>

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.404
No, thanks.

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:18.127
Sorry. Uh...

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.617
<i>- Incoming call from work.</i>
- No, I don’t wanna answer.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.786
- Where’s the button to...
<i>- Incoming call from work.</i>

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.705
I don’t know how to... No, thank you.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:28.249
<i>- Incoming call from...</i>
- Decline the call!

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.930
Hello? Anyone here?

01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:48.102
Someone tell me where I sit?

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.358
What the...? Okay.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.778
- Hello?
- Surprise!

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.488
Congratulations, Noah.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.573
Ever since your first day as an assistant,

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.284
no one has worked harder
or wanted it more.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.952
Son, you’ve earned this.

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.121
- Earned what exactly?
- This.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.085
Your new office,
Mr. Senior Vice President.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.670
This is my office, huh?

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.299
Mr. Chun came from Shanghai
specifically to be here for this.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.011
Congratulations, Mr. Ashby.
This is great news.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:27.350
With our biggest accounts,
your success is our success.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.769
It’s a ton of Chinese.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.857
Thank you so much.

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:37.527
I speak Chinese?!

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.029
That’s so cool!

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.449
I don’t even know what I’m saying.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:48.246
Well, according to most prognosticators,

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:52.583
with our large-cap portfolios
outperforming this bear market...

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.669
What is Mandarin for
“Get a room, you two”?

01:01:56.921 --> 01:02:01.259
...it should elicit fortuitous returns.

01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:02.593
Absolutely right.

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.345
Whoo.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:07.557
Holy shit! I know some big ass words!

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.813
I don’t know what you said.
Yes. You seem happy.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.189
He’s so awesome!

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.983
So I’m happy. Is this kid great?

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.866
Let me give you a tour of the place,
Mr. Chun. Show you under the hood?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.342
- All-star.
- Thank you.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.947
Thanks a lot, Terrence.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.409
Thanks a lot, Darryl. Bill.
I know your names. Big Jeff.

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:29.746
Little Tony. Hey, Claudette. Rob. Carl.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.415
- Thank you, Courtney.
- So great.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.376
Sharon. She’s got a sick kid.
I feel bad for her.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.628
I don’t know how I know that.
I know everyone’s name.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:41.007
Max! What’s up, my man? Whoo. We did it.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.509
Yeah, “we.” Did it. Yeah.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.136
Yes, we did.

01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:48.347
Do you mind if I steal you from the parade
and talk to you real quick?

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.057
Uh, yeah, sure. Come on.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.768
Welcome to Noah’s lair.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.103
Ooh, this is sweet, dude.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.105
Whoa.

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.944
Look what we got here.
Mr. Senior Vice President.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.613
- May I?
- You may.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.325
- Ah.
- This is cool, right?

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:10.411
I... am accomplished.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.121
- Yeah.
- It’s pretty incredible.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.372
- Mm-hmm.
- That’s cool.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.919
- Are you okay?
- Hey, do me a favor.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:20.254
- Can you look at this on my back for me?
- Sure.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.549
What am I looking for? That mole?
Yeah, I’d get that checked out.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.843
No, look for the knife
you stabbed me in the back with

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.136
when you stole my promotion.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.556
I’ve been busting my ass
for three years trying to get this.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.142
This has been my plan, Noah. It’s my plan.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.103
What are you talking about?

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.188
That’s good.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:40.900
Play dumb and act like it wasn’t me
who got you a job here in the first place.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.152
Me who doctored
your pathetic little résumé.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.446
I literally begged Costigan
to hire you here.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.699
Okay. Then there has to be
something that I could do.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.743
You know? I’m the senior VP.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.453
- You’re my best friend...
- “Friend”?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.539
No, no, no, no.

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:58.417
We haven’t been friends for years.
You used to be chill, really cool.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.546
And then you turned into
a corporate ass-kissing piece of shit!

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:04.006
So we’re what? Enemies?

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:06.300
Fuck you.

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.639
Oh, uh, can I borrow your pen?

01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:12.974
Yeah.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.522
I’ll leave you two.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.191
I lied.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:35.872
Oh, my God.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.208
It’s just from stress eating.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:47.008
Oh. Um, sorry to bother you, sir,
but you shouldn’t be in here right now.

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:49.760
You’re 20 minutes late
for the meeting with the Avalon execs.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.180
You know what? I think...

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:56.100
I am gonna need an hour of personal time.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:57.852
- Thank you.
- Uh, it’s...

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.186
That’s impossible.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.398
Closing this deal will pay for
your wedding and your honeymoon in Fiji.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.358
I’m gonna go to Fiji with Avery?

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.486
That would be pretty awesome.
When will this meeting be over with?

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.738
- In an hour.
- Good.

01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:11.842
- Then you have your flight to Charlotte.
- I’m going to North Carolina today?

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.910
You return late afternoon,
and then you prep for...

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.203
Just let me see that. What is this?

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.415
It says that I’m booked every day
for the next three months.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:23.711
What if I bailed on that business trip
and took a very well-deserved half day?

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:27.840
Sir, no. You would be fired instantly.
Seriously, do not do that.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.426
Remember Davis? He’s homeless now.

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:33.346
I drive by his tent
on the way to work every day.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:37.934
It’s kind of cute. He’s got his dog
out there and everything, but...

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:41.479
Anyways, congrats on your engagement.
You’re a lucky man.

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:44.815
I’d like to go over a couple of quick
scheduling changes that you’ve got.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.192
Omaha on the 15th...

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.158
I made it. I made it.

01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:56.702
So, sorry I’m late.
Have you guys seen Avery?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.496
Sorry I’m late. Have you seen...?

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:01.123
Those snacks look good,
but I can’t have any.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.210
I’m putting myself on a diet.
Have you guys seen Avery at all?

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.963
Avery’s parents. Really nice to meet you.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.047
- Meet us?
- Again.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.300
Nice to... It’s good to see you.
Honestly, it’s good to see you.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.053
Cousin Shannon.
Wow, you do look like Garth.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.304
I could tell.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.889
Thank you.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:20.518
Wow. Okay.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:26.273
Well, now that I have your attention,
if anyone has seen my beautiful fiancée,

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:31.237
please let her know that her presence
is requested at the piano,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.239
where I would like to kick things off

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.117
with a song that I played for Avery
on the night we first met.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.952
Ohhh.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:39.704
I used to do this for a living.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:46.210
♪ <i>Well</i> ♪

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:47.920

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.755
♪ <i>Shout</i> ♪

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.093
That’s not how the song goes at all,
so let’s try that again.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.303
Is the piano out of tune? Something...

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:59.265
All right. A-one more time! Hit it!

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:02.685

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:04.186

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.150
I, uh, must be rusty.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:11.610
But, you know, the jet lag is kicking in.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.240
As soon as Avery joins the duet,
I feel that I will have my groove back.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:18.451
Has anyone seen Avery, by the way?

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:20.286
Hey, dude.

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:23.080
- That was beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.884
- I don’t believe when you say that.
- Good.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.418
Been a while since I’ve played.
Have you seen Avery anywhere?

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:28.627
She’s with Ethan.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:30.504
What?

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:33.340
Holy shit. What happened to him?

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.385
We think it might have been the taquitos.
Right, Ethan?

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.804
So what happened?

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:42.141
Did your flight get delayed,
or did you hit traffic?

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.977
I am so sorry.
I truly tried to get here as fast as...

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.854
Okay, why is he here exactly?

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:48.939
I’m-I’m leaving anyway.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.568
Um, don’t eat the taquitos
or seven-layer dip.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.696
Poor thing, wait. You wanna lay down
on our bed for a minute?

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.407
I think he wants to probably lay down
in his own bed.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.159
Here. Here you go, big guy.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.495
We’ll get you some fresh air,
some Pepto chewables.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.747
I have ’em in the glove compartment,
so I’ll take him.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.042
Are you sure? But you just got here.
I’m sure everybody wants to say hi.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.294
- Maybe Carrie can take him home.
- It’ll be quick.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:12.713
- So... You look so good, by the way.
- Thank you.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.966
- Thanks.
- I love you so much.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.852
Okay. Let’s go ahead and get you home.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.813
Forever.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.486
Please don’t puke in my back seat.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.117
Um...

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.493
Look, I’m sorry. I’m...

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.330
I mean,
those taquitos are a silent killer.

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.874
No. No, it wasn’t the taquitos.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.752
- Was it the seven-layer dip?
- It was...

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:55.005
- Look, I made it up. Okay?
- Oh, did you?

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.466
Because I’m a liar, okay? I’m no good.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.176
I even stole a plate.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.345
What kind of asshole steals a plate?

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:04.305
A beautiful plate.
I’ve never stolen anything in my life.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:09.185
I don’t know what’s come over me.
I’ve just become this... terrible person.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.770
- You’re too nice.
- No.

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.231
If that makes sense.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.108
Like, I, you know... Sometimes I’m like,

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:17.694
“Ah, Ethan. I don’t really like Ethan,
because he’s such a nice guy.”

01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:19.238
No, I’m not. Okay?

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.116
I’ve been coveting thy neighbor’s wife
in my mind.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.952
Hey, not cool!

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:28.163
It isn’t cool, and I would recommend
that you stop doing that.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:31.625
I’m just gonna... I’m gonna tell you,

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:36.005
I might have told Avery
that I’m in love with her.

01:09:36.087 --> 01:09:37.089
What? Oh!

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:40.352
Did you catch your nose?

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:42.636
Did you break your nose?
Is your face okay?

01:09:43.386 --> 01:09:44.680
Look, I...

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.515
I deserved that.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.309
Okay? I’m...

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:49.894
I’m sorry. I...

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:55.149
I know I have... I have no right
to say these things. I just...

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.735
Ever since I met her, I’ve felt like...

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:00.321
you know,
it should have been Avery and me,

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:03.073
and if I didn’t tell her,
she would never know.

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:04.657
I’m sorry.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.290
What did she say when you told her?

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.043
She said she wished things were different.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:21.759
Noah...

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:24.261
do you mind if I just have a quick...

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.057
Just like a... just a quick nap?

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.976
Just a...

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.151
Yeah.

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:41.445
Go ahead, buddy.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:52.748
I’m gonna regret this.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.627
There you are.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.089
Avery texted you like ten times.
She went to bed worried.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.758
Well, I’ve been driving around all night,

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:05.427
thinking about how I’ve ruined
all of our lives.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.804
At least you kept it light.

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.266
Oh, are you okay?

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.647
Why doesn’t Avery love me?

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.238
You’ve known this whole time, haven’t you?

01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:29.201
Why didn’t you say anything?

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:31.704
Um...

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.169
Noah, I know she cares about you.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.463
Deeply.

01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:44.591
But, no, it’s...

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.677
it’s not love.

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:53.517
And she’ll probably do...
whatever she has to do to make it work.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.271
I just think she doesn’t want to f-fail.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.401
Hey, it’s not you. You’re a good guy.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.446
Sometimes relationships are about...

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:08.198
intangible things.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.827
Oh, yeah.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.748
Yep. You’ve said that before.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.334
I have?

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.881
Kinda.

01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:27.217
I like it when we talk.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.012
I like it when we talk.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.101
But you’re right.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.103
Avery deserves to be happy.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.021
Yeah.

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:42.316
And she should be with the right guy,

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:44.318
even though that right guy isn’t me.

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:48.864
So I have to fix it.
I have to go back in time and fix it.

01:12:48.947 --> 01:12:49.990
What? What?

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:51.885
Where you going?

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:52.993
To play Cupid.

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:54.536
What?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.121
Okay.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:57.706

- Great costume.
- Yeah, it’s from <i>A League of Their Own</i>.

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.215
I actually haven’t seen the movie.

01:13:48.298 --> 01:13:50.217
Yeah, I haven’t seen it either.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.887
I needed a last-minute costume,
and my friend Carrie had it laying around.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.651
Did you say it wasn’t your favorite movie?

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:58.392
- Who are you?
- This is Norm. He brought me here.

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.561
- Do you guys want a drink?
- No, it’s Noah.

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:02.688
And I think you guys should talk.

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:06.150
Honestly.
’Cause there is a connection here.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:09.445
I’m gonna mingle. I love this song.
I love this party. So...

- Thank you.
- Scored us the whole bottle.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.976
- What made you come up to me?
- I don’t know.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.479
I thought that you had a familiar face.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.065
I’m wearing goggles.
You can’t even see me.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:29.733

You wanna go somewhere else?

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:30.252
Yeah. I think I know a place.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.422
Let’s go get Ethan and Avery. Should we?

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.424
- Let’s do it.
- Let’s do it!

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:47.769
It’s so bright.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:48.853
It is.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:57.696
I mean,
of course they’d be naturals at that.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.616
They look <i>good</i> together.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:01.700
They do.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:02.909
Cute.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.328
That’s their first kiss.

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:15.797
You play piano.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.675
I got honorable mention
in a talent show once.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:19.926
Oh, really?

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.554
And you play Oscar Peterson.

01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:25.641
Well, you don’t play OP. OP plays you.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.643
That is true. That is true.

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.192
All right. Not bad for Cupid.

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:40.405
So did Avery get you into him or...?

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.867
Avery’s music knowledge
is 100 percent stolen from me.

01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:47.371
If it were up to Avery, she’d be listening
to Jonas Brothers or Linkin Park.

01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:51.541
Peruse at your own will,
if you want to get schooled.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.876
Okay.

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:54.461
- This is your playlist?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:56.546
There are some deep cuts in here.

01:17:58.131 --> 01:17:59.216
So you...

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.343
You’re the one that likes jazz.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.095
Yes.

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:07.307
And you like <i>A League of Their Own</i>.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.601
I hand-made her costume.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:14.898
So the foosball table in your living room
is yours, not Avery’s.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:17.275
How’d you know I had a foosball table
in my living room?

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.279
Avery.

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:23.323
She told me earlier.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:24.783
Candid.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.747
Right. Um, I’m probably cross-eyed.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.624
- Hmm.
- No?

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.168
That’s what I look like in my prom photo.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.212
- Oh.
- I know.

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.506
Oh, my God! That is horrible!

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:41.675
You were actually worse than that.
You were this.

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:43.677
Wait. Cross-eyed and droopy. Huh?

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.803
Oh.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.849
I... I think you look good.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.562
I’m really glad I came out tonight.

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.355
Yeah, me too.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.733
I almost didn’t.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.067
Why?

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.696
Ah, I’m going through this, like,
really weird breakup.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:07.117
I knew he’d be at the party,
and I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about him.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.455
You know, you either want to strangle him,
make out with him, cry in the bathroom.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.125
You... He was at the party?

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.209
Yeah.

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:20.881
Who was he? Was he the AC/DC guy?

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:22.507
No. No. But...

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.009
Was he Hulk smash?

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:26.762
No. I believe
you made fun of this guy though.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.263
Jell-O Shot Doctor?

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.806
What?

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.725
I-I-I did not know that.

01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.705
That’s all right. How would you know?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.062
You ever keep spinning around
in the same relationship

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:37.826
over and over and it’s just going nowhere?

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:42.110
Yeah. Yeah, I’ve been
in that relationship before.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.823
Hey! Guys, come take pictures with us!

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.408
- Nah.
- Mmm, yeah.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.252
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Let’s do it. No, come on.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.703
- Yep.
- Be a team player.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:54.122
You’re wearing a jersey,
for Christ’s sake. Come on.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.044
- Get in here.
- Come on.

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.447
- Come on.
- Ready?

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:02.214
- We’re all very happy.
- Whoo!

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.174
Okay, now we’re a little scared.

01:20:04.257 --> 01:20:05.509
Now Carrie just vomited.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:06.593
Ugh.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:08.887
Now Carrie fell out of the...

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.557
- Now we hurt Noah.
- Sorry, sorry. Oh, no!

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.326
Where the hell am I?

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.955
It’s 6:45 a.m. Rise and shine.

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:42.337
Aaah! Whoo! On a scale of one to titties,
how epic was last night?

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.714
W-We’re friends, right?

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.716
What are you talking about?
We’re best friends.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.344
I mean, technically,
you did go home solo yet again,

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:51.888
but what’s important is
we shared a kick-ass experience.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.517
I brought home Haley, the dietitian.
Old soul.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.726
Hey, where’s Avery?

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.937
Avery’s probably with Ethan.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.147
- So they’re dating?
- Yep. Engaged.

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.732
So, um...

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.943
where’s Carrie?

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:06.611
Her friend?

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.281
Uh, I don’t know.
I haven’t seen her in a few years.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.645
You said she got back with her ex
and fell off your radar.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.100
What’s with all the questions, bro?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.036
Jell-O Shot Doctor?

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.749
No, she says that they...
that-that she doesn’t like him.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.835
- So that can’t...
- What’s wrong with you?

01:21:22.502 --> 01:21:24.004
What are you talking about?

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.714
I’m talking about me and Carrie, Max.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.549
I-I’m talking about fate.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.759
Fate is a tricky lady.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.220
When you try to figure her out,
you just get more confused.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:36.057
All I know is the mistakes I’ve made
and the ladies I’ve laid

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.184
have made me who I am today.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:41.062
If I were to go back and
relive it differently, I wouldn’t be me.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.147
And I like me.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.524
I thought things were supposed to happen
for a reason.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.151
That’s what strippers and idiots say.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:49.779
Things happen randomly
for no reason at all.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.489
But they create opportunities, Noah.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.534
And you learn from those opportunities,
even the missed ones.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.746
The question is,
can you recognize that next opportunity

01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.581
when it matters the most?

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.919
I’ve been watching these speeches online.
Really inspirational.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.004
This kid, 15 years old.

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:08.131
Not a lot of subscribers, but...

01:22:08.214 --> 01:22:09.633
Noah!

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.927
I made us breakfast,
most important meal of the day!

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.050
Gotta go!

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.025
- Noah?
- Wow.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:30.612
Hey, you just missed Avery and Ethan.
Everything okay?

01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:33.406
Carrie, for the past three years,

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.242
I’ve been pining over
what I thought was destiny,

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:40.705
but no matter what I would do,
Ethan would end up connecting with Avery,

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:44.334
and I would always seem
to connect with you.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:47.629
’Cause this whole time,
it was meant to be me and you.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.089
Wasn’t it?

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:56.930
- What the hell are you doing?
- What do you mean?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.890
- Jesus!
- Okay, I thought...

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.977
I thought this was the moment
that-that-that...

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.271
when our mutual feelings
would come together and...

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.358
blossom.

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.985
What are you talking about?

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.696
- We’ve barely hung out.
- That’s not true, exactly.

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:15.198
A long time ago, we met at that party.

01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:18.618
We had a great time, I wound up getting
back together with my ex-boyfriend.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.787
Yeah. Why did you do that?

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.623
What kind of question is that?

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:26.126
There’s been times when you’ve hated me,

01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:28.753
and there’s been times
when you’ve hit me with trees.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.047
And then there’s been times

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:33.883
when... you’ve been my only friend.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:38.054
And there has to be one moment
over the past three years

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.639
where you thought about us.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:41.850
And you wondered.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.854
Okay, maybe.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.356
But... I don’t know.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.608
I’m getting ready for a date.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.736
With who? Jell-O shot guy?

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.363
- His name is Phil.
- Phil is a stepdad name.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:56.656
You ready?

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.116
What’s up, player? Phil.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.161
Hey, Phil. Noah.

01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:02.704
- All right. Two minutes?
- Yes.

01:24:02.787 --> 01:24:04.039
Cool.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:09.878
Well, are you happy?

01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:16.342
You know what? We’re late.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:20.180
Where you going? Hmm?
Avery and Ethan’s engagement party?

01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:22.432
No, actually, that was last night.

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:24.559
No, it’s tonight. It’s supposed to be...

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:27.687
Oh, my God, of course.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:31.691
I got Avery and Ethan together
one day earlier this time.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.777
So... Shit!

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.195
Oh!

01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:36.362
Goddamn time travel.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:37.989
What?

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.199
You were right.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:42.368
Relationships are about intangible things.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.913
They’re about moments.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:48.458
The real moments
and who you share them with.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:51.920
And the realest moments
that I’ve had over the past three years

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:53.004
have been with you.

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:59.094
You know, I know you don’t understand,
but I’m gonna fix this. Okay?

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.556
I’m sorry. I... Bye, Noah.

01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:12.941
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.193
Well, hey, hey, yo.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.778
- Hey, Chad. What’s up?
- Hey, Noah.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.072
- Where’s the photo booth?
- Uh, what photo booth?

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:20.198
That one.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.159
- It’s right there.
- No, the one with, like...

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.923
- The mahogany, the wood and the...
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.748
They got rid of it. A while back, man.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:29.833
What?

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:32.252
- Sorry?
- No.

01:25:32.335 --> 01:25:33.711
That-That can’t happen.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.506
I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.

01:25:36.589 --> 01:25:37.507
I’m stuck here.

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:40.194
The girl I love is dating someone else.
Is that what you’re saying?

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:42.679
Yeah. Story of my life.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:46.099
No, it’s not the story of your life,
because you’re not a time traveler, Chad!

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:50.270
Can I get a drink?

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:53.231
Classic Noah.

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.441
<i>Welcome to Boogie Booth.</i>

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:58.069
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.780
<i>Get ready.</i>

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:03.408
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.618
<i>You’re doing great.</i>

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.413
<i>- We’re almost done.</i>
- Hey.

01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:11.166
What are you doing in here?

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:16.588
Obviously,
I am taking a personal photo collage

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:17.839
of hopelessness.

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:19.674
Okay.

01:26:20.466 --> 01:26:22.236
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.928
We came to see you play.

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.848
And you didn’t show up to our party
last night, so we were worried.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.516
Hey, buddy. Yikes.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.351
You need a water? I got you.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:31.978
- No. Give me...
- Thanks, honey.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:35.899
Come on.

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.494
What are you doing taking photos

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:40.028
in a piece of junk like this?

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.989
Well, it’s the only one they have, so...

01:26:43.072 --> 01:26:45.617
Your photo booth at home
takes way better photos.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.743
What?

01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:48.036
Something happen to it?

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.539
Oh, my God. Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that thing?

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.543
- You got me the photo booth?
- Yeah.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.422
- Why?
- Because we’re friends.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:04.302
Oh, my God.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.512
It...

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:09.432
It makes perfect sense. I need you.

01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:10.600
What?

01:27:10.683 --> 01:27:13.353
I need you in order to meet Carrie.

01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:15.855
I was <i>supposed to</i> meet you
at the Halloween party,

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.000
and everything else was supposed
to happen after that.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:20.276
Here. Got you a ginger ale.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.570
Oh, you really are perfect.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.740
You guys are perfect together.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:28.034
I gotta go back
and I have to do everything

01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:30.828
<i>exactly</i> how I did it the first time,
and not change a thing.

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:33.665
Because everything
<i>does</i> happen for a reason. Right?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.042
Or maybe it doesn’t.
Or maybe Max was right.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.169
- Or maybe I’m just a stripper.
- What?

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.255
I love you.
I’ll see you at the engagement party.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.425
Oh, my God.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:48.179
- He knows it was last night, right?
- I don’t think so. He’s very drunk.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:55.895
Oh!

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:58.481
Oh, my God.

01:27:58.564 --> 01:28:00.441
You look so good in here!

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.498
One last time.

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.555
- Whoo! Hulk smash!
- Jesus.

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.638
Are you okay?

♪ <i>Ooh</i> ♪

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.318
It’s the sound of history.

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:47.322
Wow. You really like Cookie Crisp.

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:49.949
I love it. You should get more.

01:28:50.033 --> 01:28:53.202
Tomorrow. At 1:00 or whenever.

01:28:54.203 --> 01:28:57.165
And don’t go to the store right down
the street. Go to the one on Third.

01:28:57.248 --> 01:28:59.459
Wow, that’s very specific. Thank you.

01:28:59.959 --> 01:29:03.087
Oh, my God,
it is so nice to have a good guy friend.

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:04.671
It is.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.260
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.515
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:29:20.938 --> 01:29:22.690
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:25.693
Cheers.

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:29.905
- Thank you. You too.
- Thank you.

01:29:30.823 --> 01:29:33.493
Hi. Oh, my God. How are you?

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.414
Candid.

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:41.667
Oh, Noah.
Hey, I haven’t seen you in forever.

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:46.923
It’s been a while, huh?
I’ve been, um... been traveling a lot.

01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:48.007
Yeah?

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.842
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:52.011
You, uh... You look good.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:54.097
Oh. Thank you.

01:29:55.014 --> 01:29:56.015
You look good.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:57.642
Thanks.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:01.145
So, do you believe all that?

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.647
Believe what?

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.440
All that stuff about them

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:07.068
finding each other
and falling in love all in one night.

01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:08.653
I don’t know.

01:30:09.612 --> 01:30:12.198
I mean, normally I’d call bullshit, but...

01:30:13.282 --> 01:30:15.368
some things are meant to be.

01:30:17.286 --> 01:30:18.496
Yeah.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:25.086
You know,
I know you probably have like a...

01:30:25.169 --> 01:30:27.421
a photo shoot or something cool tomorrow.

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:30.842
But did you wanna go get
a drink or something?

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.135
Oh, you wanna ditch?

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:35.429
Yep, I wanna just leave
and not say goodbye to anyone.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:37.515
Just disappear. Vanish.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:40.601
I’m catching a vibe
that you also want to do that.

01:30:41.185 --> 01:30:43.146
Are we shits for leaving early?

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.064
Uh... Mmm.

01:30:48.067 --> 01:30:50.945
Nah. They don’t need us anymore.

01:30:52.989 --> 01:30:55.241
- You like jazz?
- No.

01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:58.119
I’m kidding. I am jazz.

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:01.706
- Well, then come on. Let’s go.
- Yeah?

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:03.916
Candid.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.002
No, that’s mine. That’s my thing.

01:31:06.085 --> 01:31:08.171
Seems like it’s my thing now,
I’m holding the camera.

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:10.047
- No, that...
- Candid.

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.383
Okay.
I’ve done that already. We’re good.
