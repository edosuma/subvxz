WEBVTT

00:04.987 --> 00:06.288
- Boss.
- Hey.

00:06.714 --> 00:08.381
Got a male, white,

00:08.406 --> 00:10.992
17 years old, took a shot to the head.

00:11.027 --> 00:13.366
Victim's been ID'd as a Richard Dowd.

00:13.391 --> 00:14.825
Son of Frank Dowd? I don't know.

00:14.859 --> 00:17.294
- Everyone here seems to know him.
- Defense attorney.

00:17.328 --> 00:19.463
If you went to court on a
major case, you'd know him.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.865
Handed me my ass on the stand
on more than one occasion.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.668
Well, tonight he lost his son.

00:24.702 --> 00:26.411
Yeah.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.808
We've got stippling on the forehead,

00:30.842 --> 00:32.342
but no star-shaped entry wound.

00:32.377 --> 00:35.076
- This was close range, but not contact.
- Okay.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.814
And a .22 Smith & Wesson was found

00:36.848 --> 00:38.482
over where Atwater is searching.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.250
Well, let's bag his hands and clothes.

00:40.285 --> 00:43.570
Check for GSR. And get a
round-robin on that pistol, Kev.

00:45.723 --> 00:47.925
No, no, it's okay.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.761
You can't go there, okay? You can't go.

00:50.795 --> 00:52.529
Stay right here. Stay.

00:52.564 --> 00:53.931
Honey, I've got you.

00:53.965 --> 00:56.767
- I'm Detective Olinsky.
- Not now.

00:56.801 --> 00:59.169
Just give us a minute. Not now.

00:59.204 --> 01:01.501
- I got you.
- Yeah, okay.

01:02.264 --> 01:04.578
You can't go there.

01:08.546 --> 01:12.220
- Intelligence.
- Yo, what do we got on the victim?

01:12.245 --> 01:15.419
Richard Dowd, he went by Richie.

01:15.453 --> 01:18.288
He was a senior at Lakeside.
Captain of the lacrosse team

01:18.323 --> 01:20.724
and winner of the dean's
award for academic excellence.

01:20.758 --> 01:21.802
Priors?

01:21.827 --> 01:24.371
Not unless getting early admission
to Yale is a crime these days.

01:24.395 --> 01:26.296
Okay, I'll tell him.

01:26.331 --> 01:27.865
That was Maury down in Ballistics.

01:27.899 --> 01:30.200
He says that when the
techs turned Dowd over,

01:30.235 --> 01:31.535
a bullet fell out of his hoodie.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.270
- Run down, check it out.
- Maury says

01:33.304 --> 01:36.671
he wants to speak to you in person.

01:37.742 --> 01:40.155
Right. Run point till I get back.

01:46.284 --> 01:47.877
Hey, Maury.

01:48.353 --> 01:52.623
Hank, thanks for coming.

01:52.657 --> 01:54.283
I...

01:54.308 --> 01:55.392
What's up?

01:55.426 --> 01:58.038
Um, first off, your
DOA from this morning

01:58.063 --> 02:00.497
was killed with the .22
recovered on the scene.

02:00.532 --> 02:02.399
- Okay.
- I ran it through IBID,

02:02.433 --> 02:04.434
the gun, the wound, the
round, they all match up.

02:04.469 --> 02:08.572
But here's the thing, it
also matches up perfectly

02:08.597 --> 02:12.267
to a case that you worked 17 years ago.

02:12.310 --> 02:15.488
- Right, what case?
- The Ruffalo murder in Bridgeport.

02:15.513 --> 02:16.614
No, that's impossible.

02:16.648 --> 02:19.349
We recovered that murder
weapon from the shooter's home.

02:19.384 --> 02:22.786
I went over the report
six times before I called.

02:22.820 --> 02:25.393
Seventeen years ago, you recovered a gun

02:25.418 --> 02:27.424
that was the same
caliber, make and model.

02:27.458 --> 02:29.411
But the bullet itself

02:29.436 --> 02:32.963
was too disfigured for a conclusive ID.

02:32.997 --> 02:36.934
Luckily, microscopy's gotten
a little better since then.

02:36.968 --> 02:40.504
So I pulled the original slug

02:40.538 --> 02:43.941
and I tested it against the
one in the killing today.

02:43.975 --> 02:47.293
The ballistic markings,
they're identical.

02:47.318 --> 02:50.957
Six lands with a right hand twist.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.618
The guy we put away
for the Ruffalo murder

02:54.652 --> 02:57.387
- is doing life at Stateville.
- I'm sorry to hear that,

02:57.422 --> 03:00.457
but ballistics don't lie.

03:00.491 --> 03:02.659
You had the wrong gun.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.305 --> 03:14.872
No abrasions, no contusions,
no defensive wounds.

03:14.907 --> 03:17.211
The only injuries were
consistent with a dead man fall

03:17.258 --> 03:19.483
and on top of that,
his hoodie was zipped

03:19.508 --> 03:21.275
and his jewelry was intact.

03:21.310 --> 03:23.110
Any other physical
evidence at the scene?

03:23.145 --> 03:24.489
Richie's iPhone was found in his pocket,

03:24.513 --> 03:26.347
but it needs a thumbprint to unlock it.

03:26.381 --> 03:27.945
We can subpoena the provider,

03:27.970 --> 03:29.705
but it's gonna take a
while to get the call logs

03:29.729 --> 03:31.764
and the texts, the emails.

03:31.789 --> 03:33.223
No exigent circumstances,

03:33.248 --> 03:34.610
that's what the phone guy's gonna say.

03:34.634 --> 03:36.063
There's no imminent
threat, no flight risk,

03:36.087 --> 03:37.191
that sort of thing.

03:37.226 --> 03:38.292
Can I see that?

03:38.327 --> 03:40.328
Hey, where's Voight?
He still at Ballistics?

03:40.362 --> 03:41.851
Haven't heard from him.

03:41.876 --> 03:43.474
That three digit code
on his account number,

03:43.498 --> 03:45.366
that's a family plan.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.001
So if it's in his father's name...

03:47.035 --> 03:49.804
Yeah, he can give us access to it.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.106
Al, you still got it.

03:52.140 --> 03:53.980
Everyone, Al's still got
it. Did you hear that?

03:54.009 --> 03:56.464
Erin, tweet that out. Al's still
got it. The world should know.

03:56.488 --> 03:57.816
You think Frank Dowd's ready to talk?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.267
Let's find out.

04:00.963 --> 04:03.174
We're so very sorry.

04:03.552 --> 04:06.127
I still can't believe it.

04:06.421 --> 04:09.490
Where are you at on this
case? Any suspects you like?

04:09.524 --> 04:11.559
Well, that's actually why we're here.

04:11.593 --> 04:13.720
Do you know if anyone
would wanna hurt your son?

04:13.745 --> 04:16.572
- No!
- Everybody loved him.

04:17.099 --> 04:19.399
When was the last time you saw Richie?

04:19.434 --> 04:22.637
Last night. We had dinner at Rosebud.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.305
Okay.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.539
- How did he seem?
- Good.

04:27.242 --> 04:29.911
Happy. He was talking about

04:29.945 --> 04:33.133
which dorm he wanted
at New Haven, right?

04:33.682 --> 04:35.917
Did he say where he
was going after dinner?

04:35.951 --> 04:38.519
He didn't. Why isn't
Area Central Homicide

04:38.553 --> 04:40.590
investigating this case?

04:41.056 --> 04:42.857
You're in good hands, Mr. Dowd.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.192
- Don't worry.
- If we could get access

04:45.227 --> 04:47.028
to your son's call logs,
it would really help

04:47.062 --> 04:48.777
with the timeline.

04:48.802 --> 04:50.331
You pay the bills, Mr. Dowd.

04:50.365 --> 04:51.542
So you're in control of the account.

04:51.566 --> 04:53.367
All we need is your written consent.

04:53.402 --> 04:55.760
Let me look at the language.
I'll get back with you.

04:55.785 --> 04:59.040
It's your standard, boiler-plate
consent to search form.

04:59.074 --> 05:01.108
You've seen a million of these.

05:01.143 --> 05:03.177
I'll get back to you.

05:08.424 --> 05:11.225
Again, we're very sorry.

05:12.234 --> 05:14.041
We'll let ourselves out.

05:23.007 --> 05:26.088
Well, he's looking to get
this settled on the street.

05:34.743 --> 05:36.002
My man.

05:37.512 --> 05:39.413
- There he is!
- Hey.

05:39.448 --> 05:40.955
Denny, how are you?

05:40.980 --> 05:43.408
- You look good.
- You too, brother.

05:44.641 --> 05:46.141
Little bit older.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.732
Yeah. Maybe a little more than a little.

05:47.756 --> 05:49.290
You're buttering me up. Look at me.

05:49.324 --> 05:51.425
Looking to borrow money,
my layabout brother-in-law

05:51.460 --> 05:54.662
- beat you to it.
- I'm good on that end.

05:54.696 --> 05:57.408
Thank God. So what you got?

05:57.470 --> 05:59.400
I just wanna run something by you.

05:59.434 --> 06:02.436
Look, this gun we recovered

06:02.471 --> 06:04.972
at a homicide we were
working last night.

06:05.007 --> 06:07.274
They ran ballistics.

06:07.309 --> 06:08.743
Apparently the same weapon

06:08.777 --> 06:11.360
was used in the Ruffalo murder.

06:12.547 --> 06:14.348
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, I know.

06:14.383 --> 06:16.430
That's what I said, but...

06:16.455 --> 06:18.419
- Well, who ran it?
- Maury Kerr.

06:18.453 --> 06:20.121
Maury.

06:20.155 --> 06:22.123
The only reason he
hasn't been let go of,

06:22.157 --> 06:24.592
his old man was tight
with the deputy chief.

06:24.626 --> 06:27.081
He's certain about this, Denny.

06:30.878 --> 06:32.366
We got the right guy.

06:32.401 --> 06:33.667
Look, the gun you recovered

06:33.702 --> 06:36.019
was in Valentine's closet.

06:37.054 --> 06:38.503
Right?

06:38.957 --> 06:41.976
In a cigar box, upper right hand side.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.478
- Like it was yesterday.
- Okay, your CI

06:44.513 --> 06:48.315
who ID'd Valentine, I
mean, how reliable was...

06:48.350 --> 06:50.151
We're not doing this.

06:50.185 --> 06:52.330
What, is Maury bucking for a
promotion or some damn thing?

06:52.354 --> 06:55.523
I got no idea. Valentine killed Ruffalo.

06:55.557 --> 06:58.080
He's doing time for it and that's it.

06:59.828 --> 07:01.495
The gun doesn't match.

07:01.530 --> 07:03.464
You look like a cop

07:03.498 --> 07:06.167
who's been on the
hamster wheel too long.

07:06.201 --> 07:08.402
Come on, now, go park it
on the beach in Florida

07:08.437 --> 07:10.538
for a couple weeks,
man, and clear your head.

07:10.572 --> 07:12.289
I'm serious.

07:13.575 --> 07:15.735
It's good seeing you, Hank.

07:19.711 --> 07:21.649
I need you to pull a file for me.

07:21.683 --> 07:24.185
It's a cleared, closed
homicide from 2000.

07:24.219 --> 07:27.254
Victim's name is Ruffalo,
offender is Valentine.

07:27.289 --> 07:29.557
- Denny Woods, case officer.
- 2000?

07:29.591 --> 07:31.325
That could be an issue.

07:31.359 --> 07:33.160
- Why's that?
- Couple years back,

07:33.195 --> 07:34.705
when we merged all the areas together,

07:34.729 --> 07:37.832
a number of boxes from
2000 and 2001 went missing.

07:37.866 --> 07:40.401
A lot of Detective Woods'
files were in that group.

07:40.435 --> 07:43.204
- They were?
- Yep, you're out of luck.

07:43.238 --> 07:45.116
But if it's any consolation,
you're not the only one

07:45.140 --> 07:47.274
- asking for that file.
- Who else?

07:47.309 --> 07:48.719
There's a notation from nine months ago.

07:48.743 --> 07:52.079
A Sharice Valentine put in
a public records request.

07:52.114 --> 07:55.176
- Offender's daughter?
- Same last name, anyways.

07:55.201 --> 07:56.707
Thanks.

07:57.839 --> 07:59.379
Hey, Jane.

07:59.639 --> 08:02.691
- What can I do for you, Kev?
- How you doing?

08:02.724 --> 08:05.092
- I'm good. How are you?
- Okay, so,

08:05.127 --> 08:07.294
you know, I'm going down
for my detective badge

08:07.329 --> 08:09.263
and I've been taking
these night classes.

08:09.297 --> 08:11.532
Just trying to get ready for the exam.

08:11.566 --> 08:15.071
Two of these are a
suicide, one is a murder.

08:15.096 --> 08:17.954
The assignment is for me
to identify which is which.

08:17.979 --> 08:20.141
What, you're asking me to tell you?

08:20.175 --> 08:22.376
- Yeah.
- Isn't that cheating?

08:22.410 --> 08:25.001
- No, I don't think so.
- Hey, guys.

08:25.313 --> 08:26.548
Sorry to interrupt.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.482
I need a few more shots of our DOA.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.417
- You mind if I...
- I'm done processing him.

08:30.452 --> 08:32.477
He's bagged and tagged. Go ahead.

08:34.623 --> 08:37.124
Yeah, Jane, I wouldn't
even consider that cheating.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.827
I think that's just me
just knowing the right

08:39.861 --> 08:42.611
smart, beautiful person to ask to...

08:42.635 --> 08:44.231
to ask to help me out a little bit.

08:44.265 --> 08:45.900
That one, there, is the murder victim.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.434
You're so smart.

08:47.469 --> 08:48.469
How'd you know that?

08:48.503 --> 08:49.770
The name's Charlie Perkins.

08:49.804 --> 08:51.772
I cut his ass open three years ago.

08:51.806 --> 08:54.408
We found four 9mm slugs inside.

08:54.442 --> 08:55.776
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.160
Well, I appreciate you.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.027
I don't think people
give you enough credit.

08:59.052 --> 09:00.915
You know what? They don't. They don't.

09:00.949 --> 09:02.483
Our DOA Richie Dowd's

09:02.517 --> 09:04.685
got quite the photo
collection on his phone.

09:04.719 --> 09:07.788
Most of them are this girl, right here.

09:07.822 --> 09:11.036
In very few of the photos
does she have any clothes on.

09:11.660 --> 09:13.460
Her face is partially
obscured in all these.

09:13.495 --> 09:15.083
Yeah, that's about the
only thing you can't see.

09:15.107 --> 09:17.298
Yeah, so me and Ruz
haven't ID'd the girl yet,

09:17.340 --> 09:18.876
but we did a reverse
Google Image search,

09:18.900 --> 09:22.203
found out that somebody's been
posting the exact same pics

09:22.237 --> 09:23.871
on a revenge porn website.

09:23.905 --> 09:26.140
Looks like our golden boy's
not so perfect after all.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.776
Well, so now we have a motive.

09:28.810 --> 09:30.511
All we need to do is
find out who she is,

09:30.545 --> 09:32.479
where she's at, who she runs with.

09:32.514 --> 09:34.848
I'm wondering if we can take
the partial shots of her face,

09:34.883 --> 09:36.494
put them together,
make a composite image,

09:36.518 --> 09:38.219
and run it through facial recognition.

09:38.253 --> 09:39.397
Yeah, that's definitely worth a shot.

09:39.421 --> 09:40.721
I got a buddy at OCD Tech.

09:40.755 --> 09:42.523
- I bet they'd help out.
- All right.

09:42.557 --> 09:44.153
Guys, I got something.

09:48.697 --> 09:50.798
Seventeen years ago,
Voight worked a murder case

09:50.832 --> 09:52.333
in the neighborhood he grew up in.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.511
The victim was a friend of his,

09:53.535 --> 09:54.969
owned a corner store in Bridgeport.

09:55.003 --> 09:56.537
Nick Ruffalo.

09:56.571 --> 09:58.739
At the time, they thought
the shooter was this guy,

09:58.773 --> 10:00.841
Terrance Valentine.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.343
Ballistics just confirmed

10:02.377 --> 10:04.678
that they had the murder weapon wrong.

10:04.713 --> 10:07.748
The gun that shot
Ruffalo is the same gun

10:07.782 --> 10:11.518
that we recovered from the
Dowd crime scene last night.

10:11.553 --> 10:13.854
- Where's Valentine now?
- He's in prison.

10:13.888 --> 10:15.766
- Voight helped put him there.
- We gotta figure out

10:15.790 --> 10:17.524
who killed Richie Dowd so that Voight

10:17.559 --> 10:19.860
can figure out how that gun was used

10:19.894 --> 10:21.534
in the Ruffalo murder,

10:21.559 --> 10:22.693
which is starting to look like

10:22.717 --> 10:24.785
a real wobbly conviction right now.

10:33.323 --> 10:35.909
- Yes?
- Hi. Sharice Valentine?

10:35.944 --> 10:38.412
- Yes.
- Sergeant Hank Voight.

10:38.446 --> 10:40.808
Okay, what's wrong?

10:41.339 --> 10:44.251
Actually, I'm looking back
into your father's case.

10:50.365 --> 10:52.175
Are you serious?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.073
I am.

10:55.879 --> 10:58.809
- May I come in?
- Yeah.

10:59.683 --> 11:02.618
My dad wasn't some angel
before he was sent to prison

11:02.652 --> 11:05.955
but, you know, sometimes
I think we got lucky.

11:05.989 --> 11:07.356
I mean, at least he's still alive.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.833
Tyson's Discount Dresses.

11:17.867 --> 11:19.575
The same date and time
that the murder happened.

11:19.599 --> 11:23.073
Almost to the minute. It's
printed there, at the top.

11:23.331 --> 11:25.096
What happened to the original?

11:25.167 --> 11:27.477
I gave it to the other detective, Woods.

11:27.512 --> 11:28.946
Never heard back. And then when

11:28.980 --> 11:30.948
I requested the file
from the police last year,

11:30.982 --> 11:33.120
they said it was gone.

11:34.352 --> 11:36.320
This... this doesn't prove

11:36.354 --> 11:37.831
your dad's the one
who made the purchase.

11:37.855 --> 11:39.723
- You understand that, right?
- My mom passed

11:39.757 --> 11:42.693
giving birth to me, Sergeant Voight.

11:42.727 --> 11:44.795
There wasn't anybody but my dad

11:44.829 --> 11:47.458
to buy a dress for my first communion.

11:52.237 --> 11:54.200
Thank you for your time.

11:54.225 --> 11:55.633
Hey.

11:56.274 --> 11:57.574
Please don't open this up

11:57.609 --> 12:00.147
unless you're gonna
follow through with it.

12:02.096 --> 12:06.928
I don't think I can deal
with another false hope.

12:48.581 --> 12:50.048
All right, my connect at OCD.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.574
ID'd the girl from Richie Dowd's phone.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.812
This is Jo Jo McKinnon. She
goes to Kennedy Park East.

12:53.837 --> 12:56.392
She's 18, no criminal
history, parents are divorced.

12:56.417 --> 12:58.146
Her dad has primary custody.

12:58.171 --> 12:59.214
His name's Raymond McKinnon.

12:59.238 --> 13:00.939
He lives at 4044 North Saber.

13:00.974 --> 13:02.385
All right, the sooner we
move on this the better.

13:02.409 --> 13:04.076
A CI just texted me.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.155
Apparently Frank Dowd's put
out a reward on the street

13:06.179 --> 13:07.581
for information on his son's killer.

13:07.605 --> 13:09.532
- How much?
- 15 grand.

13:09.557 --> 13:10.901
Guys are coming out of the woodwork.

13:10.925 --> 13:12.693
All right, Adam, Kev, you guys go see

13:12.718 --> 13:15.400
- if Jo Jo's willing to talk.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.859
4044 North Saber.

13:30.504 --> 13:32.159
- Hi, Raymond McKinnon?
- Yeah.

13:32.184 --> 13:34.374
I'm Officer Ruzek,
this is Office Atwater.

13:34.408 --> 13:36.776
We're from CPD. Is Jo Jo in?

13:36.811 --> 13:39.045
- Why?
- A young man by the name of

13:39.080 --> 13:40.614
Richie Dowd was murdered last night.

13:40.648 --> 13:43.012
- We believe your daughter knows him.
- She was home last night.

13:43.036 --> 13:44.784
Okay, well, that's fine. We're just...

13:44.819 --> 13:46.151
we'd still like to talk to her.

13:46.176 --> 13:47.776
Are you aware of the whole photo thing?

13:47.824 --> 13:50.301
- Yeah, we are.
- Well, when that bastard

13:50.326 --> 13:52.627
first started putting those
photos of Jo Jo out there,

13:52.662 --> 13:53.929
no one gave a damn.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.922
Yeah, well, we are
very sorry about that.

13:55.970 --> 13:57.437
She had to drop out of high school

13:57.472 --> 13:59.573
because of the humiliation.

13:59.607 --> 14:01.742
She was contemplating suicide.

14:01.776 --> 14:03.797
And we're still dealing
with it every day.

14:03.822 --> 14:05.411
And it could have been stopped.

14:05.446 --> 14:08.315
But because his dad's
some big wig lawyer...

14:08.349 --> 14:10.450
Sir, this is a homicide investigation.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.752
I heard you.

14:11.786 --> 14:14.024
And am I sorry Richie Dowd got killed?

14:14.049 --> 14:16.556
No. Far as I'm concerned, he's a bully

14:16.591 --> 14:18.508
who got what he deserved.

14:18.533 --> 14:21.135
She was home last night. Up in her room.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.461
You wanna know more? Get a warrant.

14:39.272 --> 14:41.082
Hey.

14:41.629 --> 14:43.897
So I ran all of Woods' arrest history,

14:43.931 --> 14:46.001
including any case where he was listed

14:46.026 --> 14:47.441
as additional police personnel.

14:47.528 --> 14:50.497
This is every pinch he's
ever been involved in.

14:50.531 --> 14:52.666
So a couple years before the murder,

14:52.700 --> 14:55.035
Woods locked up Valentine
on an unrelated robbery.

14:55.069 --> 14:58.396
Valentine had a BB gun, so
he gets off with probation.

14:58.421 --> 15:00.467
Did you know any of this?

15:01.042 --> 15:02.451
No.

15:02.476 --> 15:06.279
Hank. Do you really wanna
lock horns with Denny Woods?

15:11.872 --> 15:14.273
All right, I ran Jo Jo
McKinnon's phone records.

15:14.308 --> 15:15.741
She made three calls to Richie Dowd

15:15.777 --> 15:18.045
the week of the murder,
all ten seconds in duration.

15:18.079 --> 15:20.447
Yeah, about the time it takes
to tell someone to go to hell.

15:20.481 --> 15:22.950
Yeah, I also dumped her
GPS data for the last month,

15:22.984 --> 15:25.285
just looking for any shared
way-points with Richie.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.588
The only breadcrumb we got
is that she met with Richie

15:27.614 --> 15:29.619
at 2200 hours the day
before he was killed.

15:29.682 --> 15:31.716
We still can't put her at
the crime scene night of.

15:31.751 --> 15:33.326
Jo Jo doesn't leave the house much,

15:33.351 --> 15:34.830
except to go to a
private tutoring center.

15:34.854 --> 15:36.755
She attended class as
recently as yesterday.

15:36.789 --> 15:38.841
And I got the address and
her schedule right here.

15:38.866 --> 15:41.037
- Let's get that to Adam and Kev.
- All right.

15:42.427 --> 15:44.068
Chief.

15:44.093 --> 15:45.496
Who's the case officer

15:45.531 --> 15:47.787
- on the Richie Dowd murder?
- I am.

15:47.812 --> 15:50.763
Area Central Homicide's
taking over the case.

15:50.914 --> 15:52.214
What?

15:52.239 --> 15:53.904
This has been Intelligence
from the jump off.

15:53.928 --> 15:54.990
We worked the crime scene.

15:55.015 --> 15:57.241
Yeah, well, Frank Dowd doesn't
want you working it anymore.

15:57.265 --> 15:58.787
Apparently, he's got enough juice

15:58.812 --> 16:00.880
with the brass above me
to have it transferred out.

16:00.905 --> 16:04.005
This case goes over
to Area Central Homicide,

16:04.030 --> 16:06.098
it won't be a trial, it'll be a funeral.

16:06.123 --> 16:08.909
- You're saying what, Detective?
- Well, plenty of Dowd's clients

16:08.943 --> 16:10.722
are into him so for some big cake.

16:10.747 --> 16:12.575
And more than one will be willing
to settle it on the street.

16:12.599 --> 16:14.207
- All they need is a name.
- We got word

16:14.232 --> 16:16.010
that Dowd's throwing money around.

16:17.452 --> 16:18.949
Okay.

16:18.974 --> 16:20.855
I'll delay the paperwork
until end of shift.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.972
But then Area Central's taking it.

16:22.997 --> 16:24.660
It's the best I can do.

16:34.316 --> 16:36.800
What the hell are you doing here?

16:37.152 --> 16:38.920
I'm looking into your case.

16:38.954 --> 16:41.389
Yeah? So you can add some more charges

16:41.423 --> 16:42.876
for something else I didn't do.

16:42.901 --> 16:44.559
Listen, new information has come up.

16:46.195 --> 16:47.795
Yeah? What?

16:47.830 --> 16:49.797
Please.

16:49.832 --> 16:51.818
Please, sit down.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.287
Let me ask you something.

16:57.673 --> 16:59.807
Did you have a beef with Detective Woods

16:59.842 --> 17:02.132
before the Ruffalo murder?

17:03.812 --> 17:07.848
Look, it's more like he had one with me.

17:07.874 --> 17:09.617
- Okay.
- Look, I had the balls.

17:09.651 --> 17:11.652
I tried to make a beef against him

17:11.686 --> 17:13.454
for knocking me around in the district.

17:13.489 --> 17:16.736
But that went nowhere. Big surprise?

17:17.252 --> 17:20.355
But Woods, yeah, he found me after.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.617
And he told me to my face
that he'd settle the score.

17:23.696 --> 17:26.673
Is there anyone who
can back that story up?

17:27.915 --> 17:29.383
No.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.126
Hell no.

17:31.586 --> 17:33.454
You bring somebody else in here.

17:33.488 --> 17:34.932
Look, I'll talk to
them, but I ain't about

17:34.956 --> 17:37.257
to trust your lying ass.

17:37.292 --> 17:41.195
My friend took a bullet
in the forehead over $122.

17:41.229 --> 17:42.949
You're lucky they didn't
pull you out of the...

17:42.973 --> 17:44.023
Lucky?

17:44.048 --> 17:45.687
Look, I've been rotting in here

17:45.712 --> 17:48.178
like meat for 17 years.

17:50.975 --> 17:54.292
You know what? I'm glad you came by.

17:54.317 --> 17:57.854
So I can finally tell you
in person to kiss my ass.

18:00.409 --> 18:02.314
Now get me out of here.

18:05.090 --> 18:06.557
Yeah.

18:06.843 --> 18:08.076
Yo...

18:21.467 --> 18:23.459
Hey, Jo Jo.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.186
How you doing?

18:25.623 --> 18:26.771
Who are you?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.406
I'm Atwater. This is Ruzek.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.941
- Chicago PD.
- Hey.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.043
My dad told me not to talk to you guys.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.162
Is that who you're calling right now?

18:34.187 --> 18:37.256
- And if it is?
- That would be a mistake.

18:37.281 --> 18:39.050
Yeah? Why's that?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.886
I mean, chances are, he's
gonna give you bad advice.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.014
Like telling me not to talk to you?

18:44.272 --> 18:46.106
- That would qualify, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:46.141 --> 18:47.441
And that's bad, how, exactly?

18:47.475 --> 18:48.636
'Cause you'll get arrested.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.521
As opposed to us just giving
you a ride to the station

18:50.545 --> 18:53.886
and letting you answer
some questions voluntarily.

18:53.911 --> 18:55.628
Listen, it's your call.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.204
And tell us about your
relationship with Richie Dowd.

19:06.238 --> 19:07.649
To be honest with you,
I'm not in any big hurry

19:07.673 --> 19:09.540
to revisit what happened, okay?

19:09.575 --> 19:11.242
It's upsetting to me and my family.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.643
We understand that.

19:12.678 --> 19:14.478
Okay, we do.

19:14.513 --> 19:17.248
But the fact remains
that Richie was murdered

19:17.282 --> 19:20.377
and you were one of the
last people to talk to him.

19:22.901 --> 19:25.469
We started dating about six months ago.

19:25.504 --> 19:27.884
We met a couple weeks
before that, I guess.

19:27.909 --> 19:30.463
And what was your relationship like?

19:30.580 --> 19:33.716
- Normal.
- How did it end?

19:33.750 --> 19:36.819
I told him it was Senior
Spring and I wanted to be free.

19:37.024 --> 19:38.837
How'd he take that?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.196
Freaked out.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.826
What did you do when he
started posting the photos?

19:43.860 --> 19:45.728
I begged him to stop, but he didn't.

19:45.762 --> 19:47.140
Then he started posting
them again the other day,

19:47.164 --> 19:49.150
which is why I called him.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.568
Do you have any idea who
might've killed Richie?

19:52.602 --> 19:53.939
No.

19:54.377 --> 19:56.148
You don't think it was
anyone who was upset

19:56.173 --> 19:58.073
about what he did to you?

19:58.108 --> 20:00.728
- Friend or a family member?
- Look...

20:01.422 --> 20:04.673
in spite of everything he's done to me,

20:06.049 --> 20:07.827
when I found out what happened,

20:09.515 --> 20:11.171
I cried.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.171
He was my first boyfriend.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.098
I loved him. He loved me.

20:21.036 --> 20:23.005
Just too much.

20:28.654 --> 20:30.632
All right, where are we at
connecting the two cases?

20:30.656 --> 20:32.334
We're plugging away,
but we still don't know

20:32.358 --> 20:34.493
how the same gun could've
been used in both murders.

20:34.527 --> 20:36.761
- Well, find out.
- Hey, boss...

20:36.796 --> 20:38.336
Hey.

20:38.361 --> 20:40.595
Someone's here to see you, Hank.

20:54.507 --> 20:58.131
Have a seat. You might
wanna get that door.

21:11.317 --> 21:13.259
I've got a theory.

21:13.793 --> 21:15.408
You wanna hear it?

21:15.433 --> 21:16.642
Sure.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.631
You fell in love with the tight-bodied

21:19.666 --> 21:21.907
school teacher 20
years younger than you.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.013
First woman you been
with since Camille died.

21:24.047 --> 21:27.283
And she throws a hump into you.

21:27.317 --> 21:31.153
Makes your eyeballs roll
back like a slot machine.

21:32.621 --> 21:35.591
Then she starts taking you
to her church, you know,

21:35.625 --> 21:38.260
where they clap their
hands and shake their butts.

21:38.295 --> 21:42.478
And now, you're grasping for salvation.

21:43.306 --> 21:45.275
Am I close?

21:46.377 --> 21:47.728
No.

21:49.547 --> 21:52.482
I'm just making sure we
put away the right guy.

21:54.573 --> 21:57.020
This has nothing to do
with the Valentine case.

21:57.055 --> 22:00.123
This is about you.

22:00.158 --> 22:02.025
Standing on the ledge of your career,

22:02.060 --> 22:03.860
looking down at all the outlaw moves

22:03.895 --> 22:06.863
you pulled in the gang unit
and being haunted by them.

22:06.898 --> 22:09.533
Which is not my problem.
You would be well advised

22:09.567 --> 22:11.927
- not to try and make it...
- Denny, don't you want to kn...

22:13.203 --> 22:15.044
Lieutenant.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.153
Lieutenant...

22:22.453 --> 22:24.254
don't you wanna know what happened?

22:24.288 --> 22:26.091
Already do.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.265
And I'm exceedingly comfortable

22:28.299 --> 22:31.929
with the case we presented,
as is the deputy chief.

22:31.954 --> 22:34.789
And the Conviction Integrity Unit.

22:34.814 --> 22:36.473
But the gun doesn't match.

22:36.507 --> 22:39.142
I trust my CI on that
case more than a damn gun.

22:39.176 --> 22:42.612
In fact, he helped me put
away a whole lot of bad guys.

22:42.647 --> 22:45.115
Hank, you go pulling a thread,

22:45.149 --> 22:48.251
there's no telling what all unravels.

22:54.391 --> 22:56.726
Quit digging into this.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.773
Or... what was the line you
used to say all the time?

22:59.797 --> 23:01.385
Yeah.

23:01.986 --> 23:03.822
We're going for a ride.

23:31.152 --> 23:33.979
So where we at with the Dowd case?

23:35.255 --> 23:38.224
There was a 911 call
from Frank Dowd's house

23:38.258 --> 23:40.236
the day after the sexting
pictures hit the Internet.

23:40.260 --> 23:42.128
But the day before Richie was killed.

23:42.162 --> 23:45.150
The housekeeper said she
saw an adult white male

23:45.175 --> 23:46.842
trying the front door handle.

23:46.876 --> 23:48.210
Patrolmen responded to the scene.

23:48.244 --> 23:49.845
They couldn't find anybody,

23:49.886 --> 23:52.448
but the housekeeper ID'd

23:52.473 --> 23:54.390
Raymond McKinnon

23:54.417 --> 23:56.652
from a photo array. That's Jo Jo's dad.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.520
It's enough for a warrant.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.726
Where you going?

24:04.994 --> 24:07.467
Just run the case. Keep me posted.

24:07.492 --> 24:09.600
- Hank...
- Let him go.

24:26.410 --> 24:28.237
Hank Voight?

24:29.034 --> 24:30.969
Janine?

24:30.994 --> 24:32.808
How you been?

24:34.285 --> 24:36.691
Good. Busy.

24:38.089 --> 24:40.066
I'm sorry it's been so long.

24:41.626 --> 24:43.727
A lot of Nick's friends
sort of faded away

24:43.761 --> 24:46.229
- after he got killed.
- Yeah.

24:46.263 --> 24:48.298
I guess they didn't want to be reminded

24:48.332 --> 24:50.800
he's not here anymore or whatever.

24:52.837 --> 24:54.628
What do you need?

24:56.307 --> 24:59.242
I'm actually looking back into his case.

24:59.276 --> 25:00.566
Why?

25:00.591 --> 25:03.050
I think we may have
put away the wrong guy.

25:06.417 --> 25:10.220
Listen, I remember
catching the tail end of you

25:10.254 --> 25:11.821
talking to my partner when he told you

25:11.856 --> 25:13.623
that we caught the guy who did it.

25:13.658 --> 25:15.015
Okay?

25:15.040 --> 25:18.795
And you said it felt like
you were seeing things.

25:18.836 --> 25:19.945
Remember that?

25:19.970 --> 25:22.432
I mean, do you remember
what you meant by that?

25:22.466 --> 25:26.603
I was walking back
to the storage room

25:26.637 --> 25:29.472
and I saw this guy walk in,

25:29.507 --> 25:32.280
approach Nick at the counter.

25:32.777 --> 25:34.396
I barely got a look at him.

25:34.421 --> 25:36.780
But I could tell that he was white.

25:36.814 --> 25:38.789
And five seconds later, or...

25:38.814 --> 25:41.618
what felt like five seconds anyway...

25:41.652 --> 25:44.821
I heard the gunshot. I came running out.

25:44.855 --> 25:48.940
There was nobody here
except Nick, bleeding.

25:50.661 --> 25:54.297
So when Detective Woods
showed me Valentine's photo,

25:54.331 --> 25:58.168
I was surprised because he's black.

25:58.202 --> 26:00.870
Because how could he have gotten
into the store that quickly?

26:00.905 --> 26:02.929
And what about the white guy?

26:05.007 --> 26:07.444
Detective Woods said
that happens sometimes

26:07.478 --> 26:09.772
on the heels of a trauma.

26:10.181 --> 26:12.468
The mind plays tricks on you.

26:20.324 --> 26:23.174
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.131
Mr. McKinnon.

26:47.575 --> 26:48.885
You better have a damn good reason

26:48.909 --> 26:50.243
for bringing me down here.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.778
I already told you everything I know.

26:51.812 --> 26:53.380
You left out the part where you went

26:53.414 --> 26:54.773
to Richie Dowd's house the day after

26:54.797 --> 26:56.865
Jo Jo's pictures showed up online.

26:56.899 --> 26:58.443
I wish you people
would've worked this hard

26:58.467 --> 26:59.907
- when I needed your help.
- No, man.

26:59.935 --> 27:01.747
Now's the part where we
move on to you telling us

27:01.771 --> 27:03.271
why you went to Richie Dowd's house

27:03.305 --> 27:04.606
the day before he was murdered.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.309
I was looking to have a
conversation with the young man.

27:08.334 --> 27:10.270
Wanted to hurt him a little bit?

27:10.295 --> 27:12.247
Can't say I really had a plan.

27:12.281 --> 27:14.716
Was Richie home when you got there?

27:14.750 --> 27:17.519
No. I got back home, my
blood stopped boiling,

27:17.553 --> 27:19.721
- and that was that.
- Mr. McKinnon,

27:19.755 --> 27:22.894
- do you own a gun?
- I don't.

27:23.425 --> 27:25.458
So Richie was shot?

27:25.483 --> 27:27.570
- I'm asking.
- Don't play with me.

27:27.596 --> 27:29.161
You know Richie got shot.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.734
I've had three surgeries on
each hand for carpal tunnel.

27:31.768 --> 27:34.136
I can't squeeze a tube of toothpaste.

27:34.170 --> 27:36.359
Does it look like I
could pull a trigger?

27:48.151 --> 27:50.016
My dad's here?

27:50.353 --> 27:53.125
- That's right.
- Why?

27:53.356 --> 27:55.157
Because he wasn't
completely honest with us

27:55.191 --> 27:56.558
the first time we spoke.

27:56.593 --> 27:59.547
- Well, he didn't kill Richie.
- How do you know that?

27:59.572 --> 28:00.884
Because we were watching
"The Voice" together

28:00.908 --> 28:02.820
at the time Richie was killed.

28:06.203 --> 28:09.281
Can you tell that to
whoever he's talking to?

28:10.607 --> 28:12.836
You can tell them yourself.

28:15.211 --> 28:18.414
- Dad!
- Sweetie. Hi.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.148
It's okay, it's okay.

28:23.787 --> 28:25.672
Have a seat.

28:27.824 --> 28:30.945
Guys, we know somebody's lying to us.

28:31.305 --> 28:33.362
And we're done being jerked around.

28:33.396 --> 28:34.921
So whoever wants to
step up to the plate,

28:34.945 --> 28:36.633
I suggest you do so now.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.698
It was me.

28:41.723 --> 28:43.354
I killed Richie.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.174
Okay.

28:49.179 --> 28:50.682
Okay.

28:51.161 --> 28:52.825
We'll call down to the
State's Attorney's office,

28:52.849 --> 28:54.650
have you do a videotaped confession.

28:54.684 --> 28:56.318
No, no, he didn't do it.

28:56.352 --> 28:58.654
Sweetheart. Don't say another word.

28:58.688 --> 29:00.885
No, I didn't do it either.

29:02.358 --> 29:04.293
But I know who did.

29:12.374 --> 29:13.450
I didn't wanna say anything

29:13.474 --> 29:14.930
because we've been best
friends since we were kids

29:14.954 --> 29:16.919
and this whole thing is because of me.

29:16.944 --> 29:18.698
Okay. Slow down.

29:18.723 --> 29:21.024
- Who's we?
- My friend Eric.

29:21.049 --> 29:22.793
He said he was gonna tell
Richie to stop with the photos.

29:22.817 --> 29:25.480
Then he came back with this look.

29:26.054 --> 29:28.223
Like something went wrong.

29:28.248 --> 29:32.218
So you're saying that Eric
went and confronted Richie

29:32.243 --> 29:35.028
- and killed him.
- I mean, I wasn't there.

29:35.063 --> 29:37.018
So I didn't ask Eric that question.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.925
But I mean...

29:39.412 --> 29:42.105
I have a feeling that's what happened.

29:42.537 --> 29:44.175
Okay.

29:44.732 --> 29:47.165
Jo Jo, I need a last name.

29:56.618 --> 29:58.852
Chief Lugo called twice.

29:58.887 --> 30:00.984
- What do we got?
- Nothing iron clad yet,

30:01.009 --> 30:03.190
but Jo Jo gave us the name
of a boy we want to talk to.

30:03.224 --> 30:05.726
Eric Scalise. Turned 18 two weeks ago.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.628
No priors.

30:09.230 --> 30:10.731
His father Mark Scalise?

30:10.765 --> 30:12.574
- Correct.
- Yeah.

30:14.435 --> 30:18.566
Mark Scalise was Woods' CI
who helped put away Valentine.

30:23.211 --> 30:26.374
Scalise killed Ruffalo.

30:26.399 --> 30:27.920
And then he kept the murder weapon.

30:27.945 --> 30:29.516
Seventeen years later, his son uses it

30:29.551 --> 30:31.804
to kill Richie Dowd.

30:32.453 --> 30:34.621
Eric Scalise either knew
where his dad kept the gun

30:34.656 --> 30:36.210
or it was given to him.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.302
He panics after he pulls
the trigger and he tosses it.

30:38.326 --> 30:39.603
We need to get this kid off the street

30:39.627 --> 30:41.261
before he winds up dead.

30:41.296 --> 30:42.490
That bounty's still out.

30:42.515 --> 30:45.232
All right, notify the
ASA. Get a search warrant.

30:45.266 --> 30:47.438
- Hey, and keep it under wraps.
- Yeah.

30:47.463 --> 30:49.269
Okay. Where does Eric hang his hat?

30:49.304 --> 30:51.876
4032 South Lafayette Street.

30:51.901 --> 30:53.774
Same place he grew up.

30:53.808 --> 30:57.845
Hey, boss, his father still lives there.

31:15.663 --> 31:17.397
- Yes?
- Chicago PD,

31:17.432 --> 31:19.132
- I'm looking for Eric.
- He's not here.

31:19.167 --> 31:21.501
- What's this about?
- Carol, what's going on?

31:21.536 --> 31:23.337
Hey, Mark, it's been a while.

31:23.371 --> 31:25.239
- Do I know you?
- Well, he's looking for Eric.

31:25.273 --> 31:26.650
Actually, I'm looking for you, too.

31:26.674 --> 31:28.642
- For what?
- Hey, look, you can't do this!

31:28.676 --> 31:30.510
Yeah, you wanna get locked up, too?

31:30.545 --> 31:31.945
It's clear. No Eric, Sarge.

31:31.980 --> 31:34.238
Okay, come on.

31:40.321 --> 31:44.157
Mark Scalise. Man, it is odd seeing you.

31:44.192 --> 31:46.629
I mean, this is how I remember you.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.082
Seventeen years ago.

31:49.451 --> 31:53.153
A spineless, drug addicted snitch.

31:53.368 --> 31:55.535
Still, there was a kinship there.

31:55.570 --> 31:58.356
I mean, we both worked for Woods.

31:59.019 --> 32:01.541
He'd snap, we jumped.

32:01.576 --> 32:04.645
I turned my life around.

32:04.679 --> 32:06.784
Yeah, so did I.

32:08.883 --> 32:11.585
You know who else looks
different these days?

32:15.098 --> 32:17.293
Terrance Valentine.

32:17.725 --> 32:20.961
The man you put in prison
for a crime you did.

32:20.995 --> 32:22.504
Wrong.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.700
The gun...

32:27.254 --> 32:29.731
the one you kept all these years...

32:32.006 --> 32:35.320
your son used it to
murder somebody last night.

32:40.287 --> 32:42.835
So here's what we're gonna do, Mark.

32:45.553 --> 32:47.587
We're gonna make things right.

32:47.622 --> 32:50.390
You tell me why you killed Nick Ruffalo,

32:50.425 --> 32:53.905
and I'll pull back charges
on your son when we find him.

32:54.762 --> 32:56.430
Where's Woods?

32:56.464 --> 32:58.554
I'd like to talk to him.

32:58.857 --> 33:02.193
See, there's no more
hiding behind Woods.

33:02.942 --> 33:05.811
No more pinning it on other people.

33:06.623 --> 33:08.131
No more lies.

33:08.156 --> 33:10.623
- I don't know what you're talking...
- Yes, you do!

33:12.357 --> 33:13.914
And you're gonna tell me.

33:15.498 --> 33:17.017
- Sarge, we need you to...
- Not now!

33:17.051 --> 33:18.357
- It's gotta be now.
- Not now!

33:18.382 --> 33:21.217
Boss, damn it, I need to talk to you.

33:26.693 --> 33:29.496
- This better be good.
- Sarge, hold up for a sec.

33:34.287 --> 33:35.607
Chief.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.606
Let's go, Sergeant.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.842
We're headed to the Review Board.

33:45.747 --> 33:48.615
- Regarding what?
- Insubordination.

33:48.649 --> 33:50.717
And failure to respond to a direct order

33:50.752 --> 33:53.435
of a superior officer.

33:53.755 --> 33:56.323
Chief, I'm just working
the Richie Dowd murder,

33:56.357 --> 33:58.291
- wherever that takes me.
- Whoa, whoa,

33:58.326 --> 34:01.061
you're talking to me, Sergeant.

34:01.095 --> 34:03.463
And there's no more tap dancing.

34:03.498 --> 34:05.552
Move. Now.

34:11.472 --> 34:12.949
Pull everything you
have on the Dowd case,

34:12.974 --> 34:14.641
get it over to Area Central Homicide.

34:14.675 --> 34:16.376
Intelligence is done here.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.480
Hey, so kick Scalise. Yeah?

34:29.505 --> 34:30.638
Yeah.

34:30.663 --> 34:32.132
Wait, wait.

34:32.157 --> 34:35.172
This text message just came
through Scalise's phone.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.507
- There's no name attached.
- Saying what?

34:37.542 --> 34:39.342
"What's going on? What's the plan?"

34:39.377 --> 34:40.877
That's gotta be Eric.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.451
His dad probably bought
him a burner phone.

34:42.475 --> 34:44.362
Well, we can triangulate the signal.

34:44.387 --> 34:46.655
See if you can pinpoint his location.

34:50.888 --> 34:52.320
Do it.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.065
- No.
- No.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.871
It's that one, down there.

35:05.536 --> 35:08.691
Second floor, apartment
25, end of the hall.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.264
Eric Scalise, Chicago PD.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.584
Who are you?

35:20.618 --> 35:22.052
I already told you.

35:22.086 --> 35:23.387
Son of a...

35:29.585 --> 35:31.792
Look, Eric, as far as we know,

35:31.826 --> 35:34.097
you were just defending Jo Jo's honor.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.133
I mean, you don't have a record.

35:36.158 --> 35:39.060
You probably didn't mean
for anything to happen.

35:39.103 --> 35:40.981
I mean, we're thinking you went home,

35:41.006 --> 35:42.249
you dug up one of your dad's guns

35:42.273 --> 35:44.041
and you went to see Richie.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.909
And that's when things fell apart.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.310
Okay, so, now here's the problem.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.279
This is your dad's gun, right?

35:49.313 --> 35:51.214
All right, so see, him and your mom

35:51.249 --> 35:52.949
they're responsible
for providing a weapon

35:52.984 --> 35:54.718
that was used in the
commission of a crime.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.253
Just because it was in the house,

35:56.287 --> 35:58.445
where you could have access to it.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.592
Unless they drove you to see Richie

36:02.627 --> 36:03.737
and they put the gun in your hands

36:03.761 --> 36:05.095
and they said, "Go kill him."

36:05.129 --> 36:06.696
Is that what happened?

36:10.781 --> 36:12.969
Jo Jo's a good girl.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.843
And... and she just made a mistake.

36:16.307 --> 36:20.077
She didn't deserve to have
those photos posted online.

36:20.111 --> 36:23.562
I mean, she was talking about suicide.

36:24.549 --> 36:28.054
I went to Richie and I
told him to quit doing that.

36:28.079 --> 36:30.253
And... and he laughed.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.747
And turned to walk away.

36:33.157 --> 36:36.526
And so, I pulled the gun out.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.880
Just to, show him I was serious.

36:40.064 --> 36:44.911
And, and he said,
"Bitch, you gonna bring a gun?"

36:45.336 --> 36:47.269
"You better be ready to use it."

36:47.294 --> 36:50.380
And I don't even remember
pulling the trigger.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.052
But after it went off,

36:53.077 --> 36:55.380
I dropped it and ran.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.731
- This is what?
- Your son's confession.

37:22.756 --> 37:25.008
For the murder of Richie Dowd.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.295
Voight's offer still stands,

37:26.320 --> 37:28.512
but only for about two more minutes.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.580
What decides this is
whether or not you're willing

37:30.615 --> 37:33.529
to clear up what happened 17 years ago.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.153
And Eric will get
charged with what then?

37:36.187 --> 37:38.155
Involuntary manslaughter.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.556
Not murder.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.324
Meaning he still gets jail time.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.326
Yeah. He'll do three to five.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.594
But that's not life.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.329
Your son says that Richie came at him.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.698
He brought the gun to protect himself.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.545
So?

37:56.797 --> 37:58.623
Nick Ruffalo.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.211
If he'd just given up the money,

38:01.245 --> 38:03.342
nothing would have happened.

38:04.882 --> 38:08.451
But I was high, and...

38:09.198 --> 38:13.068
he just... didn't move fast enough.

38:13.758 --> 38:16.459
I called Woods after to clean it up.

38:16.494 --> 38:19.596
I was so wigged out, I
couldn't find the pistol, I...

38:19.630 --> 38:21.565
The gun that you and
Woods put on Valentine,

38:21.599 --> 38:23.533
- where'd you get it?
- He's a cop.

38:23.568 --> 38:26.570
You're a cop. You can
get anything you want.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.572
And why'd you ID Valentine?

38:28.606 --> 38:31.575
Woods fat fingered
him in the photo array.

38:31.609 --> 38:33.243
I worked a lot of cases with the guy.

38:33.277 --> 38:35.721
He had no problem cutting corners.

38:37.791 --> 38:39.583
Why'd you keep the gun?

38:39.617 --> 38:42.485
I didn't know it was the same gun.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.788
Otherwise, I would've
thrown it in the river.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.994
How do you not know that?

38:48.125 --> 38:50.360
You ever been addicted to heroin?

39:00.471 --> 39:02.478
Lieutenant Woods?

39:08.946 --> 39:11.281
As you can see, the historical record

39:11.315 --> 39:14.484
shows 56 complaints of excessive force

39:14.518 --> 39:17.079
against Sergeant Voight.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.789
That's the kind of officer he is,

39:18.814 --> 39:20.624
has been, and always will be

39:20.658 --> 39:23.426
until someone finally does something.

39:23.451 --> 39:25.906
And now, Sergeant
Voight is chasing ghosts

39:25.931 --> 39:29.799
on a 17-year-old case,
disobeying direct orders

39:29.834 --> 39:31.859
and neglecting his duties as head of

39:31.884 --> 39:33.985
the Intelligence Unit.

39:45.983 --> 39:48.343
You're gonna wanna see this.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.384
Lieutenant Woods,

40:08.873 --> 40:12.704
you are stripped of your
police powers immediately.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.195
And you are placed on a no-pay status

40:15.220 --> 40:17.556
until a full investigation is conducted

40:17.581 --> 40:21.025
into every case you have ever worked.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.720
You are dismissed.

40:33.397 --> 40:35.242
I would like to express
my gratitude to my family.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.901
In a stunning development,
Terrance Valentine

40:37.935 --> 40:40.704
was released from
Stateville Prison today

40:40.738 --> 40:44.007
after being wrongly convicted
for the murder of Nick Ruffalo

40:44.041 --> 40:46.209
17 years ago.

40:46.243 --> 40:49.269
With the Chicago Police
Department citing new evidence

40:49.294 --> 40:53.350
that showed that Mr. Valentine
could not have been the killer.

40:53.384 --> 40:56.880
The family has refused
comment at this time.

41:15.506 --> 41:18.174
- Sharice?
- Hello.

41:18.199 --> 41:21.911
I was just hoping to talk
to your dad for a minute.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.013
Hey, who is that, baby?
