<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:05.772 --> 00:08.568
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:08.602 --> 00:10.568
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:10.603 --> 00:12.037
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:12.071 --> 00:14.709
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:14.743 --> 00:17.343
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:17.377 --> 00:19.077
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:19.112 --> 00:20.710
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:20.745 --> 00:22.212
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:22.246 --> 00:23.413
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:23.447 --> 00:25.379
This was an act of terrorism.

00:25.413 --> 00:27.879
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:27.913 --> 00:30.212
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:30.247 --> 00:31.380
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:31.414 --> 00:34.015
...until something stops him.

00:34.049 --> 00:36.851
<i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:36.885 --> 00:40.388
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:41.790 --> 00:44.057
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:44.092 --> 00:47.761
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:54.401 --> 00:56.869
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:56.903 --> 00:58.871
Fuck!

00:58.905 --> 01:00.872
<i>I missed something once before.</i>

01:00.906 --> 01:03.674
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:04.944 --> 01:07.145
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:07.179 --> 01:08.779
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

01:08.813 --> 01:10.780

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:22.356 --> 01:23.589
Who are they clearing
the street for?

01:23.623 --> 01:24.923
Abu fucking Nazir, God willing.

01:24.958 --> 01:26.959
<i>Holy shit, it's him.</i>

01:29.528 --> 01:30.562
What about Abu Nazir?

01:30.596 --> 01:31.663
He got away.

01:31.697 --> 01:32.664
We just took a hit.

01:32.698 --> 01:33.965
We lost two in Beirut.

01:33.999 --> 01:36.234
Your role is
more important than ever now.

01:36.268 --> 01:37.902
So Roya's pulling you
into something, huh?

01:37.937 --> 01:39.337
I don't want to think about it.

01:48.046 --> 01:49.847
Do I know you?

01:49.881 --> 01:52.582
Some idiots hit her in a car,
then took off.

01:52.616 --> 01:53.616
I want to tell.

01:53.651 --> 01:54.651
Tell who?

01:54.685 --> 01:57.120
Our parents, the cops.

01:57.155 --> 01:57.854
We killed someone.

01:57.889 --> 01:59.122
Jesus!

01:59.157 --> 02:00.123
What?

02:00.157 --> 02:01.958
Hit-and-run, a week ago.

02:03.293 --> 02:04.493
I'll take care of it.

02:05.695 --> 02:07.662
If she did something terrible,

02:07.696 --> 02:10.531
something criminal, we would
go to the police, right?

02:10.566 --> 02:12.433
What did she do?

02:12.468 --> 02:14.201
We wouldn't just gloss over
her doing something

02:14.236 --> 02:16.304
really, really bad just because
we're in politics, right?

02:16.338 --> 02:18.840
Why is she here?

02:18.874 --> 02:20.141
I have my daughter here.

02:20.176 --> 02:21.609
I see that.
I'm sorry.

02:21.643 --> 02:22.610
What's going on?

02:22.644 --> 02:23.611
You can't do this,

02:23.645 --> 02:24.679
go to the police.

02:24.713 --> 02:25.880
This is a private matter.

02:25.914 --> 02:27.314
It's not, actually.

02:27.349 --> 02:28.882
Brody, you won't
have a deal anymore

02:28.917 --> 02:29.883
if you do this.

02:31.886 --> 02:34.054
- What is this?
- We'll do this down the line.

02:34.088 --> 02:35.222
No, Dad.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.192
You just...
you really make me sick.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.326
Hey, Dana...

02:39.360 --> 02:40.627
Dana!

02:40.661 --> 02:42.729
None of this is fucking okay!

03:48.960 --> 03:49.926
Hey.

03:49.961 --> 03:51.428
Hey.

03:51.462 --> 03:53.797
It's just me.

03:53.831 --> 03:55.798
Oh.

03:57.801 --> 04:00.203
Look, if I'm interrupting
something, I...

04:00.237 --> 04:01.404
No, no.

04:01.438 --> 04:02.939
I'm just surprised you're here.

04:02.973 --> 04:06.410
Me, too, I guess.

04:06.444 --> 04:09.079
Okay.

04:09.114 --> 04:11.815
Well, come on in.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.817
Thanks.

04:18.322 --> 04:20.291
She'll be okay.

04:20.325 --> 04:21.791
Are you sure about that?

04:21.827 --> 04:23.161
She's 16 years old.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.262
It's not like
there's a five-year-old

04:24.296 --> 04:25.263
out there
wandering the streets.

04:25.297 --> 04:26.464
That's not the point!

04:26.498 --> 04:28.466
- She ran someone over!
- I know!

04:28.500 --> 04:31.303
And she's trying desperately
to do the right thing!

04:31.337 --> 04:32.437
And you think I'm not?

04:32.472 --> 04:33.838
I don't know what the hell

04:33.873 --> 04:34.973
you're doing, Brody,
I really don't.

04:35.007 --> 04:36.074
We told her we would

04:36.108 --> 04:37.342
go to the police
and report this.

04:37.376 --> 04:38.843
I tried.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.412
And when you didn't
go through with it,

04:40.446 --> 04:41.580
what was she supposed to think?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.081
I told her we'd handle it later.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.483
Well, we told her
we would handle it now!

04:46.652 --> 04:48.086
We are supposed to be

04:48.120 --> 04:50.422
her examples
of what's right and wrong.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.591
We can't report it today,
I told you!

04:52.625 --> 04:54.126
Right, national security.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.928
You know, you invoke that
more than the president.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.963
<i>I'm doing everything I can.</i>

04:57.997 --> 05:00.432
He's got a meeting with
Roya Hammad in half an hour.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.434
Yeah.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.368
- He's basically already late.
- Yeah, from the sounds of it,

05:04.403 --> 05:06.604
he's not gonna be out
of there any time soon.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.372
He's got to be;
he can't mess this up.

05:08.407 --> 05:09.874
You act as if I have
a choice in this!

05:09.909 --> 05:12.210
- I don't!
- Of course you do.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.145
- So tell me what to do. Tell me!
- You don't know.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.814
You tell the CIA to back off!

05:16.849 --> 05:19.350
I mean, you tell them your
daughter matters more!

05:19.385 --> 05:23.187
I can't, I can't, I can't!

05:27.192 --> 05:29.226
Give me their number,
I'll do it.

05:39.438 --> 05:41.372
Hello?

05:41.406 --> 05:42.740
Oh, thank God.

05:42.774 --> 05:45.309
Tell her I'll be right there.

05:47.446 --> 05:49.414
She's at Mike's.

05:49.448 --> 05:51.649
I'll go get her.

05:51.683 --> 05:53.251
Don't.

05:55.353 --> 05:56.921
Chris, come on.

05:56.955 --> 05:58.956
We need to get your sister.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.405
Hey, this is Nicholas Brody.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.706
Please leave a message.

06:35.659 --> 06:37.527
I gotta go in there.

06:37.562 --> 06:38.461
You want some help?

06:38.496 --> 06:40.130
No, stay here.

06:58.348 --> 07:00.616
Brody?

07:03.820 --> 07:05.554
Brody.

07:05.589 --> 07:08.224
Roya's expecting you.

07:08.258 --> 07:10.259
You're already late.

07:12.496 --> 07:14.229
Brody, you need to go.

07:14.264 --> 07:15.964
No more.

07:15.999 --> 07:18.767
I can't.

07:18.801 --> 07:20.435
You have to.

07:20.469 --> 07:22.670
She said she's taking you
to meet a new contact.

07:22.705 --> 07:24.706
This is it;
it's happening now.

07:35.518 --> 07:39.188
Brody, remember why
you're doing this.

07:39.222 --> 07:42.124
What, our deal?

07:42.159 --> 07:43.493
Your family.

07:43.527 --> 07:47.097
My family?

07:47.131 --> 07:50.100
You were listening out there.

07:50.134 --> 07:51.835
You heard.

07:51.869 --> 07:55.072
Everything's falling apart.

07:57.308 --> 07:59.275
This is a nightmare.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.746
It's almost over.

08:07.517 --> 08:10.652
Come on.

08:12.989 --> 08:14.990
Come on.

08:34.278 --> 08:35.745
Hey.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.179
Hey.

08:37.214 --> 08:40.583
I'm sorry about this.

08:40.618 --> 08:42.018
No trouble.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.553
But she fell asleep upstairs.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.722
We were watching TV
and she crashed.

08:45.756 --> 08:46.923
Want a water?

08:46.957 --> 08:48.224
No.

08:48.258 --> 08:50.426
What did she say?

08:50.460 --> 08:53.062
Just that she
needed to get away.

08:53.096 --> 08:55.064
- That's all?
- Yeah.

08:55.098 --> 08:58.935
I mean, obviously,
something's going on, though.

08:58.969 --> 09:01.104
I'm surprised
she even showed up here.

09:01.138 --> 09:03.106
I'm not.

09:03.140 --> 09:05.776
She spent a lot of time here
when Brody was gone.

09:09.881 --> 09:13.951
Mike, she was involved
in a hit-and-run.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.787
What?

09:15.821 --> 09:18.290
Someone else was driving,

09:18.324 --> 09:20.425
and she's trying
to make it right,

09:20.460 --> 09:25.264
but, well, it's gotten
very, very complicated.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.400
It's tearing her up.

09:27.435 --> 09:29.402
And, please, you can't
tell her I said anything.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.403
Okay.

09:30.437 --> 09:31.403
Promise me.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.771
Yeah.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.573
Is there anything
I can do to help though?

09:36.609 --> 09:39.544
Just let her sleep,
if that's okay.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.780
I gotta go.

09:41.814 --> 09:43.448
Chris is waiting in the car.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.451
I'll have her call you
when she wakes up.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.486
Thanks.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.832
Jesus Christ.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.039
He look okay to you?

10:10.042 --> 10:12.743
Better than he
did at the house.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.345
He's under a lot of pressure.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.513
Well, it shows.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.964
We're lucky she waited.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.989
You're late.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.624
I know.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.793
You want to tell me why?

11:00.827 --> 11:01.994
Not really.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.563
I nearly left.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.031
Yeah? I nearly
didn't come at all.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.799
- Sir, you hearing this?
- Yeah.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.801
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

11:10.671 --> 11:13.006
What the hell is he doing?

11:18.380 --> 11:19.814
Brody!

11:19.848 --> 11:21.482
What?

11:21.517 --> 11:23.217
What's going on?

11:23.252 --> 11:26.254
You know what's going on.

11:26.288 --> 11:28.423
I'm being asked to
be part of an attack

11:28.457 --> 11:30.192
. on this country...
- Okay. That's enough.

11:30.226 --> 11:33.228
...without knowing
where or what or...

11:33.263 --> 11:37.832
or why, being told
"he" needs me or "they" need me,

11:37.867 --> 11:40.201
and who the fuck
are "they" anyway?!

11:40.236 --> 11:41.702
That's what's going on with me.

11:41.737 --> 11:42.937
How about you, huh?

11:42.971 --> 11:44.372
Everything good, I hope?

11:44.406 --> 11:48.409
Look, I know it's been
difficult lately.

11:48.444 --> 11:50.511
It's been impossible.

11:50.546 --> 11:53.748
And for what?

11:54.817 --> 11:56.652
I'm through.

11:58.121 --> 11:59.555
What the fuck?
Carrie's on site there, right?

11:59.589 --> 12:01.256
- Get her on the line.
- Mm-hmm.

12:11.101 --> 12:13.035
I understand
you're feeling confused.

12:13.069 --> 12:14.970
You don't have a clue
what I'm feeling.

12:15.004 --> 12:17.139
Brody, quitting is
not an option.

12:17.173 --> 12:18.807
You think whatever
you're threatening

12:18.841 --> 12:21.409
can make my life any more
fucked up than it is now?

12:21.443 --> 12:22.710
I'm not threatening.

12:22.745 --> 12:24.245
Sure you are.

12:24.279 --> 12:26.814
Come back, sit down
and talk to me.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.916
There's nothing more to say.

12:34.823 --> 12:36.223
What the hell was that?

12:36.257 --> 12:38.825
Fuck! Fuck!

12:38.860 --> 12:42.129
Shit. It's Quinn.

12:42.163 --> 12:44.131
He's gonna want
to shut us down.

12:44.165 --> 12:45.566
Oh, you think?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.967
Virgil, you have to kill

12:47.002 --> 12:48.235
the tracking on Brody's phone.

12:48.270 --> 12:49.403
- Why?
- Just do it.

12:49.437 --> 12:50.837
If Quinn asks,
tell him it failed.

12:50.872 --> 12:52.272
He won't believe that
for a second.

12:52.306 --> 12:54.074
- Well, make him.
- What are you doing?

12:54.108 --> 12:55.608
I've got to keep
this thing going.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.243
Keep what going?
Brody just blew it up.

12:57.278 --> 12:58.811
- The whole operation's dead.
- No, it's not.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.146
His cover's still intact.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.014
As long as his
cover isn't blown,

13:02.049 --> 13:03.015
he's still in play.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.683
Kill the tracking.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.424
Yeah.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.193
What the fuck, Carrie?
Answer your goddamn phone.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.128
Uh, we were having
tech problems.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.596
We lost tracking on Brody.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.864
Yeah, here, too.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.332
He must have dumped his phone.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.434
I'm on foot now.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.469
- Where?
- Looking for him.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.170
Listen to me, Carrie--
I want you to bring him in.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.305
Right.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.840
I mean now. He's out of control.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.208
I want him off the streets.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.309
So do I.

13:30.344 --> 13:31.477
Off the streets here,

13:31.512 --> 13:32.612
in front of me.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.281
He's a danger to all of us.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.615
- Tell me you hear me.
- I hear you.

13:35.650 --> 13:36.950
If we do not pick him up,
they will,

13:36.984 --> 13:38.652
and who knows what he'll say.

13:38.686 --> 13:40.320
This thing is over.

13:41.489 --> 13:44.825
Carrie?

13:44.859 --> 13:46.960
I'll tell you if I find him.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.932
- Hey, find out what happened
to that phone. - Okay.

13:58.507 --> 14:00.241
Brody, give me the keys.

14:02.244 --> 14:03.745
They'll have backup
here in three minutes.

14:03.779 --> 14:05.247
I'm trying to keep
you from spending

14:05.281 --> 14:07.048
the rest of your
life in a cage.

14:07.083 --> 14:10.085
Do you think I really care
what happens to me anymore?

14:10.120 --> 14:12.588
Well, I do.

14:12.622 --> 14:15.424
I care what happens to you,
even if you don't.

14:17.527 --> 14:18.894
Please.

14:18.928 --> 14:21.430
Give me the keys.

14:54.996 --> 14:57.064
Your protégé.

14:57.099 --> 14:59.133
She's really
outdone herself this time.

14:59.168 --> 15:01.102
Have a seat.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.104
I'll stand.

15:08.076 --> 15:10.044
Brody jumped surveillance.

15:10.078 --> 15:11.278
I heard.

15:11.313 --> 15:12.646
Carrie made it happen.

15:12.681 --> 15:13.881
You sure?

15:13.915 --> 15:15.283
The two of them are missing,

15:15.317 --> 15:16.717
Carrie's not
answering her phone--

15:16.751 --> 15:17.818
yeah, Saul I'm pretty
fucking sure!

15:19.454 --> 15:22.456
She took a confessed
terrorist off the grid.

15:25.093 --> 15:27.994
I went out on a limb
to support you on this.

15:28.029 --> 15:29.630
I even kept Walden
out of the loop,

15:29.664 --> 15:31.465
so that we could run Brody
back against Nazir.

15:31.499 --> 15:33.267
Now Brody's unraveling.

15:33.301 --> 15:35.569
Ever occur to you
Carrie's trying to fix that?

15:35.603 --> 15:37.304
Well, she's got a twisted thing
for the guy.

15:37.339 --> 15:39.006
Who knows
what her motivations are?

15:39.041 --> 15:41.075
Well, she's trying
to repair the situation.

15:41.109 --> 15:43.745
I can't bank on that.

15:43.779 --> 15:46.180
There's an attack planned, Saul,
possibly imminent.

15:46.215 --> 15:49.183
And I don't want to be the one
standing in front of the Senate

15:49.218 --> 15:53.021
explaining who Carrie was
fucking when the bomb went off.

15:53.055 --> 15:55.823
You burned your cover in Beirut
to float this operation,

15:55.858 --> 15:58.593
which, as of 20 minutes ago,
is officially shit.

15:58.628 --> 16:01.296
I'm the only friend
you've got left in the building.

16:01.331 --> 16:03.766
So if you have any idea
where Carrie is,

16:03.800 --> 16:05.167
you damn well better say.

16:08.204 --> 16:10.539
I'm not playing
games here, Saul.

16:10.574 --> 16:15.177
Get up from that chair,
find her and bring her back.

16:15.212 --> 16:17.680
With Brody.

16:24.389 --> 16:27.124
It's room number five,
over there.

16:27.159 --> 16:29.059
I really don't know
what I'm doing here.

16:29.094 --> 16:33.198
But if that's the last thing
I see before they lock me up,

16:33.232 --> 16:36.768
I could do worse.

16:38.838 --> 16:41.039
Here.

16:41.073 --> 16:46.011
You think you can save this...
you can't.

16:46.045 --> 16:49.582
I'll get us some food.

16:49.616 --> 16:53.052
They'll be looking for us,
and someone might recognize you.

17:18.213 --> 17:21.883
I promised your mother
that you would call her.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.419
I will.

17:24.453 --> 17:26.855
As soon as you woke up.

17:26.888 --> 17:29.891
Come on,
you're making me look bad.

17:32.895 --> 17:34.563
Can I stay here?

17:34.597 --> 17:36.231
Tonight, I mean.

17:36.265 --> 17:37.766
Would that be okay with you?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.234
Call your mom and ask.

17:41.604 --> 17:43.605
Go on.

17:45.475 --> 17:47.443
Okay.

17:52.448 --> 17:53.582
Hello.

17:53.616 --> 17:54.883
Hey.

17:54.918 --> 17:56.418
Hey.

17:56.452 --> 17:58.386
Mike said that you were
having dinner over there.

17:58.421 --> 18:01.556
Yeah.

18:01.591 --> 18:03.958
Um, can I stay over?

18:03.993 --> 18:05.927
Well, did he say it was okay?

18:05.961 --> 18:09.097
He said ask you.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.766
Well, it's fine with me.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.167
Just, um...

18:13.202 --> 18:15.236
What?

18:15.270 --> 18:17.638
I miss you.

18:17.672 --> 18:19.640
Mom...

18:21.709 --> 18:23.677
...is Dad there?

18:23.711 --> 18:25.912
No.

18:25.946 --> 18:28.481
Where is he?

18:28.515 --> 18:31.183
Um, I'm not sure.

18:31.218 --> 18:35.688
He tell you why he backed out
at the police station?

18:35.723 --> 18:37.891
No, not really.

18:42.531 --> 18:44.666
It was that woman from the CIA.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.701
Carrie.

18:46.736 --> 18:48.603
She just showed up

18:48.638 --> 18:51.540
and said something to him,
and suddenly it was all off.

18:54.711 --> 18:57.613
Mom?

18:57.647 --> 18:59.047
I didn't know.

18:59.082 --> 19:00.649
I'm sorry.

19:00.683 --> 19:03.285
I didn't say it to hurt you.

19:03.319 --> 19:05.287
I know, sweetheart.

19:12.863 --> 19:14.029
Night, Mom.

19:14.064 --> 19:16.032
Love you.

19:47.431 --> 19:50.667
How long do you think
before they find us?

19:50.701 --> 19:53.003
Depends how hard they look.

19:53.037 --> 19:56.406
I'm guessing
they'll look pretty hard.

20:00.945 --> 20:03.379
I was thinking...

20:03.414 --> 20:05.382
I've finally done it.

20:07.785 --> 20:09.219
What?

20:09.254 --> 20:12.356
Burned every bridge.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.792
With Abu Nazir.

20:14.826 --> 20:16.894
With the CIA.

20:16.928 --> 20:20.297
With my family.

20:20.332 --> 20:23.067
I'm more alone now than I was

20:23.101 --> 20:26.971
at the bottom
of that hole in Iraq.

20:27.005 --> 20:29.973
Whatever damage
you think you've done,

20:30.008 --> 20:32.208
the only way
to make it mean something

20:32.243 --> 20:34.144
is to stay in the game
against Nazir.

20:36.247 --> 20:38.914
No, that's over.

20:38.949 --> 20:40.316
They need you.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.318
Roya said.

20:42.353 --> 20:46.222
Believe me...

20:46.256 --> 20:48.157
whatever plan they had for me

20:48.191 --> 20:51.960
has already been replaced
by something else.

20:51.994 --> 20:53.428
And someone else.

21:21.724 --> 21:23.959
I'm done.

21:25.962 --> 21:28.430
Let the CIA do what they want.

21:31.634 --> 21:35.371
At least I'll finally be able
to stop lying to everybody.

21:35.405 --> 21:38.374
At least that part
will be a relief.

21:48.218 --> 21:50.219
Will you visit me in prison?

21:55.826 --> 21:58.628
I'll probably be
in the cell next to you.

22:01.332 --> 22:04.135
Which, I have to admit,

22:04.169 --> 22:06.537
isn't the future
I imagined for us.

22:09.608 --> 22:11.609
"Us?"

22:13.713 --> 22:15.714
What did you imagine?

22:22.356 --> 22:24.357
I'm not sure.

22:30.031 --> 22:32.600
Maybe that if we saw this
through together,

22:32.634 --> 22:36.604
if we finally stopped Nazir
once and for all,

22:36.638 --> 22:39.206
then you'd be a real hero.

22:39.241 --> 22:42.243
And that fact...

22:47.883 --> 22:51.219
...would somehow make everything
you did before not matter.

22:51.253 --> 22:54.589
That it would all just be about

22:54.623 --> 22:58.726
getting... to there.

22:58.761 --> 23:01.195
Including what I did to you?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.202
Including that.

23:07.236 --> 23:09.204
Just wouldn't matter anymore.

23:11.907 --> 23:13.908
To either of us.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.320
You know how crazy
everyone says you are?

23:25.354 --> 23:27.389
You're crazier than that.

23:36.533 --> 23:39.502
This deal of ours...

23:41.872 --> 23:44.840
...I think it's a way out
for both of us.

23:50.213 --> 23:54.216
You said
you're all alone, and...

23:57.387 --> 23:59.388
...you're not.

25:20.939 --> 25:22.907
How far is the takedown team?

25:22.941 --> 25:24.208
Five minutes.

25:24.242 --> 25:25.442
Don't do it.

25:25.477 --> 25:27.445
Estes told us to shut this down.

25:27.479 --> 25:29.113
It is premature.

25:29.147 --> 25:31.382
Or maybe we should have
done this weeks ago.

25:31.416 --> 25:34.217
There is
a fucking attack coming.

25:34.252 --> 25:37.887
And Brody is our only entry
point to Roya and the cell.

25:37.922 --> 25:39.889
Why did you tell us
where to find them

25:39.923 --> 25:41.424
if you were gonna
pull this shit?

25:41.458 --> 25:44.059
You have got to give
Carrie a chance.

25:46.663 --> 25:48.196
She's turning it around.

25:48.231 --> 25:49.964
Turning it around?

25:49.999 --> 25:51.933
Is that what you think
is going on there, really?

25:51.967 --> 25:54.235
Turning it around?
Really?

25:54.270 --> 25:56.204
Turn it off.

25:57.839 --> 26:00.074
No, tell me-- really, I'd like
your expert opinion.

26:00.109 --> 26:01.742
Is that somebody turning
something around,

26:01.777 --> 26:04.946
or is that a stage-five
delusional getting laid?!

26:04.980 --> 26:08.249
I am telling you
she can fix this.

26:15.758 --> 26:18.559
She didn't run off to Mexico.

26:18.594 --> 26:23.498
She went to a safe harbor site
where she knew I could find her.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.735
All she's asking for is time.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.008
Give her some.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.262
- Tell the takedown we wait.
- Copy that.

27:12.814 --> 27:14.481
I'm good.

27:48.582 --> 27:50.383
Yes.

27:52.619 --> 27:54.820
I want to explain...
about yesterday.

27:54.855 --> 27:57.189
That's not necessary.

27:57.223 --> 27:59.324
Yeah, it is.

28:01.593 --> 28:04.194
Give me a minute.

28:05.530 --> 28:06.830
Are you there?

28:06.865 --> 28:08.866
I'm here.

28:08.900 --> 28:12.069
I've been under
a lot of pressure.

28:12.103 --> 28:13.837
I know.

28:13.872 --> 28:15.873
No, you don't know all of it.

28:15.907 --> 28:18.542
There's been things happening.

28:18.576 --> 28:22.680
Have nothing
to do with... with us.

28:22.714 --> 28:24.881
I'm having some troubles
at home...

28:24.916 --> 28:26.249
with my daughter.

28:26.283 --> 28:28.384
I'm sorry to hear that.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.055
Look, I, um...

28:32.089 --> 28:35.191
I lost it yesterday, and, uh...

28:35.226 --> 28:37.760
I wish I could take back

28:37.795 --> 28:40.129
some of the things I said.

28:43.734 --> 28:46.202
Did you hear me?

28:46.237 --> 28:47.470
I heard you.

28:47.505 --> 28:49.906
It won't happen again.

28:49.940 --> 28:54.811
You said I'd be part of this
thing and I...

28:54.845 --> 28:57.480
I just want things
to be the way they were.

28:57.514 --> 28:59.950
I'm glad you feel that way.

28:59.984 --> 29:01.785
Thanks for the call.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.869
That's what you wanted, right?

29:18.903 --> 29:22.539
And Quinn and everybody else
listening, the whole CIA?

29:22.574 --> 29:27.078
Yeah, them, too.

29:27.112 --> 29:30.448
You think she believed it? Roya?

29:34.119 --> 29:36.421
It was the truth.

29:43.196 --> 29:46.098
Talk to me next time.

29:46.133 --> 29:48.635
Before it gets to be too much.

30:02.016 --> 30:04.218
Hey.

30:04.252 --> 30:05.719
How'd you sleep?

30:05.753 --> 30:07.621
Pretty well. Uh...

30:07.655 --> 30:11.491
I guess I felt better after
talking to my mom last night.

30:11.526 --> 30:14.494
Good.

30:14.529 --> 30:16.396
You know what she said, though?

30:16.431 --> 30:20.467
She said that she trusts
my judgment.

30:20.502 --> 30:22.335
That's news to you?

30:22.370 --> 30:27.675
My head practically
exploded, yeah.

30:27.709 --> 30:30.444
If you could hear what she
says about you, you'd know.

30:30.478 --> 30:32.379
Dana, she thinks
the world of you.

30:46.194 --> 30:49.930
Can I ask you something, Mike?

30:49.964 --> 30:51.631
Sure.

30:53.869 --> 30:56.804
Just before my dad got back,

30:56.838 --> 30:58.705
you were around all the time.

30:58.740 --> 31:02.442
You had practically moved in.

31:02.477 --> 31:07.347
And I was thinking, last night,

31:07.382 --> 31:09.883
how that must have been
hard for you,

31:09.918 --> 31:15.189
vanishing from our lives
the way that you did.

31:19.994 --> 31:22.363
So, was it?

31:25.033 --> 31:27.335
Yes, it was.

31:27.369 --> 31:29.037
It's difficult.

31:30.706 --> 31:32.707
There was no question
in my mind

31:32.741 --> 31:34.408
what was the right thing to do.

31:34.443 --> 31:37.211
And you actually did it.

31:43.852 --> 31:47.422
I need to go see someone
in Columbia Heights.

31:47.456 --> 31:50.225
Do you think that
you could give me a ride?

31:54.597 --> 31:55.931
Sure.

32:07.544 --> 32:09.212
Any response from Roya?

32:09.246 --> 32:10.846
Nope. Still waiting.

32:10.881 --> 32:12.515
We've doubled up
on surveillance,

32:12.549 --> 32:14.450
so whatever she does next,
we'll be on it.

32:14.484 --> 32:15.684
So we're good.

32:15.719 --> 32:17.720
Well, "good" is probably
an overstatement.

32:17.755 --> 32:20.790
No one's talking about throwing
Brody in lockup anymore.

32:21.925 --> 32:23.760
Just so you know,
we tracked you and Brody

32:23.795 --> 32:25.229
to the motel last night.

32:28.099 --> 32:31.167
So, what...

32:31.202 --> 32:32.803
was everyone listening in?

32:32.837 --> 32:34.872
To most of it, yeah.

32:38.143 --> 32:41.545
I don't know what's worse...

32:41.580 --> 32:43.280
Quinn's perverts
with their idiot smirks

32:43.315 --> 32:45.149
or you giving me that look.

32:45.183 --> 32:46.718
"Do I really know
what I'm doing?

32:46.752 --> 32:48.152
Am I getting
too close to him?"

32:48.187 --> 32:51.322
Or... whatever
euphemism you'd find.

32:51.356 --> 32:53.724
Are you getting too close?

32:53.758 --> 32:55.993
He was running off the rails.

32:56.027 --> 32:57.761
I did what I had to do.

32:57.795 --> 32:59.329
So that's all it was.

33:01.799 --> 33:03.666
I'm not even gonna
to answer that.

33:03.700 --> 33:04.767
Well, not too many months ago,

33:04.801 --> 33:06.936
you told me you were
in love with him.

33:06.970 --> 33:09.739
Yeah, and I was more than
a little unstable then.

33:09.773 --> 33:10.973
It's okay now?

33:12.876 --> 33:14.143
Have I lost it again?

33:14.177 --> 33:15.478
Is that what you're asking?

33:15.512 --> 33:18.247
No, I'm saying, if you're
back there again,

33:18.281 --> 33:20.816
in that place with Brody...

33:20.850 --> 33:23.952
What?

33:23.987 --> 33:26.688
It ended badly last time.

33:26.723 --> 33:28.190
For you.

33:28.225 --> 33:29.959
For everyone.

33:29.993 --> 33:32.427
I'm not your daughter, Saul.

33:32.462 --> 33:34.596
I don't need you
telling me what to do.

33:36.365 --> 33:38.600
We just picked up Roya
on the security cameras.

33:38.634 --> 33:39.834
Uh, where?

33:39.868 --> 33:41.769
The Rayburn parking garage.

33:41.804 --> 33:43.371
And our favorite congressman
just happens

33:43.405 --> 33:45.306
to be on his way there.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.207
Did I miss something here?

33:47.242 --> 33:49.476
No, everything is fine.

33:49.510 --> 33:51.545
Good. Come on,
you'll want to see this.

34:21.609 --> 34:23.076
Turn around.

34:23.110 --> 34:24.543
We're leaving.

34:36.958 --> 34:37.891
Okay, where are my follow cars?

34:37.925 --> 34:39.826
We need to be all over this.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.295
We have visual.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.438
Nervous?

34:52.473 --> 34:53.840
Hmm? No.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.242
No, I just have
a lot to do today.

34:56.275 --> 34:57.877
Really?

34:57.911 --> 35:00.246
Your chief of staff said
you were wide open.

35:00.280 --> 35:05.050
You must be wondering if
I recorded your outburst

35:05.085 --> 35:06.752
to our friends yesterday.

35:06.787 --> 35:08.220
I did.
I also reported

35:08.255 --> 35:10.522
the call you made this morning.

35:10.557 --> 35:11.890
Your apology.

35:11.925 --> 35:13.292
If that's the right word.

35:13.326 --> 35:14.493
- Do we hear those communications?
- No.

35:14.527 --> 35:16.728
Why not?
Who's she talking to?

35:16.762 --> 35:17.562
Shh!

35:18.631 --> 35:20.032
What made you change your mind?

35:20.066 --> 35:22.534
I told you, I was under
a lot of pressure.

35:22.569 --> 35:24.937
Your daughter.
Right.

35:24.971 --> 35:27.372
Where did you spend last night?

35:27.407 --> 35:29.741
Not at your house, I know that.

35:34.948 --> 35:36.915
I was with Carrie Mathison.

35:36.950 --> 35:39.118
And you woke up this morning

35:39.152 --> 35:41.287
and called to say
we were on the same track.

35:41.321 --> 35:44.657
Look, if you don't trust me...

35:44.691 --> 35:46.192
I didn't say that.

35:46.226 --> 35:48.160
You said renew the
relationship with Carrie--

35:48.195 --> 35:49.829
which I wouldn't have done,
by the way--

35:49.864 --> 35:51.297
but okay, as instructed,
I fuck her,

35:51.332 --> 35:53.066
I get the information
I can to you,

35:53.101 --> 35:55.336
and now you're giving me
a hard time about it?

35:55.370 --> 35:56.771
I didn't say that, either.

35:56.805 --> 35:58.472
No, you don't say
anything, do you?

35:58.507 --> 36:00.942
You need to calm down.

36:02.879 --> 36:04.212
What are you doing?

36:06.716 --> 36:08.651
Really?
You think that's gon--

36:09.620 --> 36:10.553
Why did we lose audio?

36:10.588 --> 36:12.489
Tighten up the
follow vehicles now.

36:12.523 --> 36:13.890
We cannot afford to lose them.

36:13.925 --> 36:14.958
Keep line of sight.

36:14.992 --> 36:17.126
And get me two more
vehicles in pursuit.

36:17.161 --> 36:18.594
Carrie?

36:18.629 --> 36:20.263
She knows.

36:20.297 --> 36:22.231
Maybe, maybe not.
We'll see.

36:26.003 --> 36:28.571
I'll go in the follow car
with Max and Virgil.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.074
All right, but Carrie,
promise me,

36:31.108 --> 36:32.341
just stay the fuck back, okay?

36:37.814 --> 36:39.781
Where the hell are they going?

37:12.282 --> 37:13.983
It was you.

37:17.087 --> 37:19.755
I should have known.

37:19.789 --> 37:22.258
Maria, shh.

37:33.470 --> 37:35.771
She's not mine, if that's
what you're thinking.

37:35.806 --> 37:37.440
I wasn't.

37:48.651 --> 37:52.621
I guess... it was obvious.

37:52.655 --> 37:54.356
Some girl shows up
in the hospital

37:54.390 --> 37:55.858
right after my mother's hit.

37:55.892 --> 37:57.426
Of course you killed her.

37:59.462 --> 38:01.297
I didn't kill her.

38:01.331 --> 38:04.166
Why are you here, then?

38:06.236 --> 38:07.770
I was in the car.

38:07.804 --> 38:11.341
It's the same exact thing.

38:14.845 --> 38:16.612
I...

38:16.646 --> 38:20.449
am so sorry.

38:24.855 --> 38:26.389
And I'm trying...

38:26.423 --> 38:28.424
Trying what?

38:28.458 --> 38:31.327
To take responsibility.

38:31.361 --> 38:33.462
What does that even mean?!

38:38.101 --> 38:39.234
I'm sorry.

38:39.269 --> 38:42.037
You're sorry.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.907
I want to go to the police.

38:44.941 --> 38:46.775
Oh, now you do.

38:46.809 --> 38:48.777
When it would just
make things worse.

38:48.811 --> 38:50.612
What do you mean?

38:50.646 --> 38:52.881
I mean it's not the deal.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.017
What deal?

38:55.051 --> 38:56.886
To keep quiet.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.488
Not say anything about it.

38:59.523 --> 39:02.625
I got two sisters
to take care of,

39:02.659 --> 39:04.293
so don't you dare mess that up.

39:04.327 --> 39:05.961
You need to keep
your mouth shut,

39:05.996 --> 39:08.130
because if you tell anyone...

39:08.165 --> 39:11.567
I get nothing.

39:17.541 --> 39:20.242
You say you want to help?

39:20.277 --> 39:22.812
Go away and never come back.

39:22.846 --> 39:26.415
Get out! Get out!

39:33.523 --> 39:35.590
Hey, are you okay?

39:35.625 --> 39:37.258
Yeah, yeah.

39:37.293 --> 39:40.027
Just drive, please.

39:57.578 --> 40:00.880
Don't worry,
we're almost there.

40:05.887 --> 40:09.289
We'll need our headlights soon.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.696
Okay... there.

40:49.866 --> 40:51.734
Virgil, stop the van.

40:51.769 --> 40:53.536
They stopped up ahead;
stop the van.

41:04.448 --> 41:06.116
Target has stopped.

41:06.150 --> 41:09.586
County Road 66,
vicinity Needham Meadow.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.156
Follow One, continue
north to 68.

41:13.190 --> 41:14.024
Follow Two,

41:14.058 --> 41:15.525
turn right at Creek Pass.

41:15.559 --> 41:17.661
I want a loose cordon
around the target.

41:17.695 --> 41:20.830
Very loose-- one mile
minimum distance.

41:20.865 --> 41:22.098
Carrie?

41:22.132 --> 41:23.466
We're holding south.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.734
Why'd they stop?

41:24.768 --> 41:26.969
We're way back;
we can't see anything.

41:27.003 --> 41:28.671
Anyone?

41:29.873 --> 41:31.707
Anyone have visual?

41:37.581 --> 41:38.815
Can you turn that off?

41:42.353 --> 41:45.188
Do you want to tell me
what we're doing here?

41:45.223 --> 41:48.392
You say you want
another chance.

41:48.426 --> 41:50.060
This is it.

42:29.903 --> 42:32.004
I think there's a third person.

42:32.038 --> 42:33.606
Can anyone else see anything?

42:33.640 --> 42:35.708
No, I don't think so.

42:35.742 --> 42:37.809
Quinn's pulling them now.

42:40.246 --> 42:42.347
I don't like this.

42:42.382 --> 42:43.915
No one does.

42:43.949 --> 42:46.051
We need to protect Brody.

42:46.085 --> 42:48.220
I want to get actual eyes on.

42:50.222 --> 42:51.923
What?

42:51.957 --> 42:54.492
It's Carrie--
she wants to take a look.

42:58.631 --> 43:00.632
Carrie, you promised
you'd stay back.

43:00.666 --> 43:03.602
I just want to drive by
to see what's going on.

43:03.637 --> 43:06.372
Look, I know
you're worried about him.

43:06.407 --> 43:09.009
We all should be--
he's our only asset.

43:13.181 --> 43:15.649
Yeah, okay, one clean pass.

43:15.683 --> 43:16.884
That's all.

43:37.174 --> 43:40.110
Are you expecting
somebody else?

43:42.613 --> 43:43.680
Can you see anything yet?

43:43.714 --> 43:45.081
It's dark out here, Carrie.

43:45.116 --> 43:48.117
I don't know if I'll be able
to see them at all.

43:48.152 --> 43:49.652
Max, you want to dim
those lights?

43:49.686 --> 43:51.654
It's like the
starship <i>Enterprise</i> in here.

43:54.224 --> 43:56.526
Brody, get in the car.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.493
Why?

43:57.527 --> 43:59.495
You're a public figure, get in.

44:06.135 --> 44:07.703
I think somebody
just got in the car.

44:07.737 --> 44:09.104
- Who?
- A humanoid shape.

44:09.138 --> 44:11.974
I told you, I can't see
shit out here.

44:12.008 --> 44:13.275
Okay, wait.

44:13.309 --> 44:14.442
What is it?

44:14.477 --> 44:15.477
Roya and somebody.

44:15.511 --> 44:17.445
I can't tell.

44:29.092 --> 44:30.993
Oh, Christ.

44:31.027 --> 44:32.361
Mirror it to Quinn.

44:32.395 --> 44:33.395
Shit.

44:34.164 --> 44:35.364
Quinn, did you get that?

44:35.399 --> 44:36.599
Yeah.

44:38.502 --> 44:40.002
We got to stop.

44:40.036 --> 44:42.338
- No, keep moving.
- We've got to go back.

44:42.372 --> 44:44.707
Hey, you're the one who just
told us for the last 24 hours

44:44.741 --> 44:46.309
to keep Brody in play.

44:46.343 --> 44:48.044
Goddamn it, Virgil!
Just stop!

44:55.085 --> 44:58.654
Quinn, that man slaughtered
our agents in Gettysburg.

44:58.688 --> 44:59.822
Yeah, I was there.

44:59.856 --> 45:01.690
He's got a ton of explosives.

45:01.725 --> 45:04.226
Which is why we need
to follow him.

45:04.261 --> 45:05.928
No, we-we're past that.

45:05.962 --> 45:08.464
Nazir's got maybe a half a dozen
people on the ground here.

45:08.498 --> 45:10.700
We've got two of them
in our sights right now--

45:10.734 --> 45:13.169
three, counting Brody--
that's a critical mass.

45:13.203 --> 45:15.037
We can shut this down.

45:15.072 --> 45:17.507
You hope.
All we know is...

45:17.541 --> 45:20.243
you move in,
the operation is blown.

45:20.277 --> 45:21.711
I think it's already blown.
Listen to me--

45:21.745 --> 45:23.946
I am listening,

45:23.981 --> 45:25.748
and I'm hearing a bad idea
that you wouldn't entertain

45:25.783 --> 45:27.216
in a million years if it wasn't

45:27.251 --> 45:28.851
for your personal attachment
to a terrorist

45:28.886 --> 45:30.920
you were boning last night.

45:32.456 --> 45:36.392
He's a asset-- our only one--
and he's in danger.

45:36.426 --> 45:37.861
Yeah, the whole country is.

45:37.895 --> 45:39.596
Carrie, we have got
this contained.

45:39.630 --> 45:41.198
Stay the fuck back.

45:41.232 --> 45:43.433
That is a direct order.
Acknowledge.

45:46.571 --> 45:47.738
Oh, Jesus.

45:48.839 --> 45:50.707
Carrie, what are you doing?
Don't do this!

45:52.276 --> 45:54.910
Carrie, acknowledge.

46:07.422 --> 46:09.223
They just grabbed him.

46:09.257 --> 46:11.725
Carrie, stay put.

46:11.759 --> 46:12.959
They're gonna kill him.

46:12.994 --> 46:14.161
That's an order, goddamn it!

46:14.195 --> 46:15.362
Tell me you hear me.

46:20.368 --> 46:22.202
Shit.

46:24.940 --> 46:25.806
Carrie!

46:29.211 --> 46:31.012
Weigh in here, Saul.

46:39.990 --> 46:42.859
What I'm wondering...

46:42.893 --> 46:45.162
what are they doing stopped
in the middle of nowhere?

46:45.196 --> 46:47.831
Next to the only clearing
for miles around.

47:07.718 --> 47:09.820
They're loading
him into a helicopter.

47:09.854 --> 47:10.687
Can you hear me?

47:13.024 --> 47:15.325
Fuck! Tell me you hear me!

47:18.529 --> 47:20.864
You-- wait, you have to track
it-- they're about to take off.

47:22.900 --> 47:24.334
We're losing him.

47:26.671 --> 47:28.672
Quinn?

47:31.709 --> 47:32.742
They're gone.

47:32.777 --> 47:34.244
They're... they're gone.

47:34.279 --> 47:36.580
They're just gone!

47:52.264 --> 47:53.598
You're back.

47:53.633 --> 47:55.000
Mike.

47:55.034 --> 47:56.335
Hey, buddy.

47:56.369 --> 47:57.536
We're up five
against Miami--

47:57.570 --> 47:58.871
can you believe that?

47:58.905 --> 48:01.074
No way.

48:05.245 --> 48:07.046
Rough day?

48:07.081 --> 48:09.549
I went to see her...

48:09.583 --> 48:11.551
the daughter...

48:11.586 --> 48:13.587
even though Dad told me not to.

48:13.621 --> 48:16.622
Okay... how'd that go?

48:19.059 --> 48:21.193
She basically called
me a murderer.

48:21.227 --> 48:23.328
Sweetie, you're not.

48:24.797 --> 48:27.632
It's how I feel
about half the time.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.107
I'm not gonna go
see the police, though.

48:36.141 --> 48:40.244
She told me not to.

48:41.847 --> 48:44.983
Did you know that
they paid her off?

48:47.186 --> 48:50.155
No.
Really?

48:50.189 --> 48:53.992
I didn't know... but I
guess I'm not surprised.

48:54.027 --> 48:56.395
There's a presidential
campaign in the works.

48:56.429 --> 48:59.932
So, what, it...
it just goes away?

48:59.966 --> 49:03.101
We're supposed to pretend
like it never happened?

49:06.506 --> 49:10.275
Because I can't.

49:11.477 --> 49:13.812
I killed someone.

49:13.847 --> 49:14.814
You didn't.

49:14.848 --> 49:17.316
I did.
No.

49:17.351 --> 49:20.820
We... drove away and just...

49:20.855 --> 49:22.489
left her there, Mom.

49:22.523 --> 49:23.790
Shh.

49:27.496 --> 49:28.529
It's okay.

49:32.735 --> 49:35.070
It's gonna be okay.

50:52.913 --> 50:54.297
Nicholas.

50:58.636 --> 51:05.178
