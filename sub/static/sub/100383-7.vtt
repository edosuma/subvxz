00:12.840 --> 00:15.480
- Oi, oi, here comes Wiley.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.480
-Hello, Kermit. Nice legs.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.240
Have you got green pubes, Kermit?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.360
What is that?

00:22.440 --> 00:24.920
- Oh, she is such a freak.
- She's a creep.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.680
You should be careful dressing like that.

00:29.320 --> 00:33.600
And you should be careful perpetuating
old-fashioned patriarchal ideology.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.720
It'll make it difficult
for people to like you.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.160
Hey!

00:39.240 --> 00:41.000
Come on, Kermit, show us your pubes!

00:42.240 --> 00:43.320
You're a bitch!

00:44.600 --> 00:45.560
Yeah, I am.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.200
<i>♪ Walking on the beaches</i>
<i>Looking at the peaches ♪</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:51.800
Mmm.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Come on then.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.600
That's it.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.720
-Good morning.
-Ah!

01:37.600 --> 01:38.800
Why are you in my bed?

01:38.880 --> 01:41.560
If you tell anyone about this,
I'll destroy your life.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.880
Did we have sex?

01:44.680 --> 01:46.360
Of course we had sex, Otis.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.360
I'm not here because I enjoy your company.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.680
But I can't find the condom.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.000
We had sex without a condom?

01:53.080 --> 01:55.760
-No, I'm pretty sure we used one.
-Well, where is it?

01:55.840 --> 01:58.000
I don't know, it's vanished.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.000
Mmm...

02:01.800 --> 02:03.840
You don't think
your vagina swallowed it, do you?

02:03.920 --> 02:06.760
-I heard about the girl--
-I can't believe I had sex with you.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.840
Okay, Ruby,
we definitely used a condom, right?

02:08.920 --> 02:11.760
Yes. I'm, like, 99 percent certain.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.440
Oh!

02:13.520 --> 02:15.720
-Sorry.
- Otis!

02:16.200 --> 02:17.360
Come down.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.160
Hello.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.720
-I'm Ruby.
-Hello, Ruby.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.840
I covet your pant suits.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.320
Oh.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.720
-Thank you. This one's--
-I was just being polite.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.080
I've gotta get to school.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.880
You said a small gathering!

02:54.960 --> 02:57.960
-It was only supposed to be ten people,

02:58.040 --> 03:01.200
but Eric invited a whole load more

03:01.280 --> 03:03.000
and suddenly 150 strangers
were in the house.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.160
- A hundred and fifty strangers?
-It was not my intention.

03:06.240 --> 03:10.200
Otis! I'm not hearing
a lot of responsibility being taken here.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.600
I have clients coming this afternoon
and my house is trashed!

03:14.680 --> 03:18.400
Oh, it's too loud, and I'm late,
and my head hurts, and I-I-I...

03:18.480 --> 03:20.240
I will help you clean later.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.720
-Later?
-Yes.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.840
Later? Otis!

03:24.440 --> 03:25.640
-Uh...

03:33.280 --> 03:35.560
See you, cheeky chops. Love you.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.560
- Are you spying again?
-I don't trust her.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.280
-Who, Body Slammer?
-No, her mum.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.560
What's she doing there?

03:46.680 --> 03:48.760
Joe, have a look, would you? I can't see.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.000
I don't know, she's watching TV.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.640
I knew she was up to something.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.680
Oh, yeah. Quick, call the police,
our neighbor's watching <i>Bargain Hunt!</i>

04:13.680 --> 04:15.360
Oh! Oh! Ah!

04:19.920 --> 04:21.320
Hey!

04:21.400 --> 04:23.320
How are you feeling, Casanova?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.680
Why is the world so bright?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.720
Because you got very drunk,
offended your unrequited love

04:29.800 --> 04:32.880
and ex-girlfriend, puked on yourself,
and danced really badly

04:32.960 --> 04:35.280
in front of most of the people
at this school.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.880
-Eric.
-Mm-hmm.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.160
-I had sex with Ruby.
-What?

04:40.240 --> 04:42.000
-Are you sure you had sex?

04:42.080 --> 04:45.080
Well, she definitely thinks we had sex.
The details are hazy.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.360
I feel really strange.
I feel like I'm either having

04:48.440 --> 04:53.600
an unusually long panic attack
or I'm just very, very thirsty... or both.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.960
-Okay, calm down and listen to me.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.400
Probably wasn't the romantic
forest glade fantasy

04:58.480 --> 05:00.520
-you imagined with Maeve.
-I did not imagine that.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.880
But you are not a virgin anymore! What?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.800
-That's exciting, right?
-It's not.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.280
-Sex has consequences.
-Well, it's not like you're gonna father

05:08.360 --> 05:10.680
Ruby's evil spawn.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.440
You did use a condom, right?

05:15.200 --> 05:16.040
Right?

05:17.160 --> 05:19.760
Otis, I have noticed
that you've not answered my question.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.720
Oh, my God.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.920
Hi, Maeve.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.600
I'm really sorry about last night.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.680
-I said--
-I heard you shagged Ruby, dude.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.320
Who knew Sex Kid was such a player!

05:35.080 --> 05:36.400
Congratulations.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.280
That was withering.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.080
Oh, no, no, no!

05:46.760 --> 05:47.960
I'm embarrassed!

05:49.560 --> 05:52.280
- Mate, have you seen this?
- What's happening?

05:53.960 --> 05:54.880
I was drunk.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.040
-Yes, yes, you were, mate.
-Seriously!

05:57.120 --> 05:59.800
I can't believe
you told Dr. Milburn I had crabs.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.880
-I said you might have one crab.
-Holy shit.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.640
Miss Sands loves doing dirty talk
with Mr. Hendricks.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.480
-Amazing.
- That is amazing.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.200
What did Jean do?

06:08.280 --> 06:10.640
Your mum said I was normal.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.640
She lied.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.960
"Connor Pearson admits to masturbating
up to 17 times a day,

06:18.360 --> 06:21.760
-which is borderline obsessive."
-I'm a monster!

06:21.840 --> 06:23.520
This is bad, very bad.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.760
How could Jean leave her notes
lying around?

06:28.280 --> 06:30.200
Well, I have to go anyway.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.600
I've got Swing Band practice.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.360
Seventeen times?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.720
Dirty, dirty pig.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.960
What on earth?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.040
I thought it was confidential!

06:51.120 --> 06:54.000
I promise you we will
get to the bottom of this.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.280
Jackson, wait!

06:55.360 --> 06:57.600
-I had to tell them.
-We're not friends, Viv.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.240
You said some pretty horrible things
to me too, you know?

07:01.040 --> 07:03.440
Fine. We were never friends
in the first place.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.200
Aimes, you're covered in mud.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.240
Yeah. I am.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.600
-Can we talk?
-Not right now, Steve. I'm late for gym.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.640
Aimes, guess what?

07:16.080 --> 07:19.560
-Otis had sex with Ruby last right.
-I'm sure it didn't mean anything.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.800
Are you okay?

07:27.320 --> 07:28.240
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.480
I'm sure he didn't mean it.
He was really drunk.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.560
Yeah.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.760
Hello, Jean speaking.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.440
<i>Hello, Miss Milburn.</i>

07:54.520 --> 07:57.480
<i>I need you to come into the school</i>
<i>at 4:00 p.m. today.</i>

07:57.560 --> 07:59.840
There's been an incident.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.840
<i>-Can you tell me what it's concerning?</i>
-Just be here at 4:00 p.m.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.520
I'll be there.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.440
Shit! Guys, come and take a look at this.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.960
Oh, my God!

08:19.880 --> 08:22.160
No dillydallying, girls.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.480
It wasn't me.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.640
-It was not me.
-I wouldn't have the time.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.120
Someone is in very serious trouble.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.440
Ah. You're on time. That's odd.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.680
I have an errand to run,
so will you be all right with Jessie?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
-Uh, yeah, I like dogs.
-Are you sure?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.960
She's very annoying.
You know, she can't even sit.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.760
We'll be fine.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.320
Um...

09:16.400 --> 09:18.840
Sir, can I go to the toilet, please?

09:18.920 --> 09:21.120
Can't it wait, Milburn?
lt's almost the end of the day.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.240
No. Sir, I...

09:23.600 --> 09:25.200
I have hemorrhoids.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.080
Oh, yes. I feel your pain.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.720
Hemorrhoid Club.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.720
Otis!

09:34.800 --> 09:35.760
Otis!

09:41.320 --> 09:42.320
Uh...

09:44.160 --> 09:45.400
-What?
-Shh.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.320
Okay, so...

09:49.080 --> 09:53.320
you know how I said I was 99 percent sure
about the condom?

09:53.400 --> 09:57.040
-Yes.
-It's more like 96.5.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.200
The details are a bit hazy

09:59.280 --> 10:01.520
and I think I remember
putting it in the bin,

10:01.600 --> 10:02.960
but I can't be sure.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.760
Okay. What should we do?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.320
-Shall we go play <i>Smash Bros?</i>
-Oh, I can't.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.760
I've got to go to a service
at my church tonight.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.520
-Is church boring?
-No.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.240
It's actually quite fun, you know.
There's singing, there's plantain,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.600
and if you're lucky,
sometimes this auntie called Gloria

10:22.680 --> 10:24.760
-starts speaking in tongues.
-Cool.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.200
-Can I come with you?
-You don't want to come to my service.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.400
I think it will be interesting,
unless you don't want me to.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.160
No! Okay, sure.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.800
But, um...
...I have to be a bit different there.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.200
Like, a bit more serious,
if you get what I mean.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.200
Yeah. That's okay.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.520
-You sure?
-Yeah.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.640
Let's go to church.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.160
What are you doing here?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.880
We've made an appointment
with your counselor.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.200
-Can't we do this another time?
-No, we're doing it now. Get in.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.400
Get in the car.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.440
Well, well.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.800
Here we are. I don't like keeping you
after school, girls, but this is serious.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.840
I had nothing to do with this,
and it'll look really bad on my school CV,

11:31.920 --> 11:33.600
-so may I go home, please?
-No, you may not.

11:34.280 --> 11:37.120
Somebody in this room
thought it would be funny

11:37.200 --> 11:39.760
to write something very cruel about me
on that mirror.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.960
We're going to sit here
until they admit it was them.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.040
No one has anything to say?

11:50.440 --> 11:54.320
Fine. You will circle
every "A" in the paper

11:54.400 --> 11:56.240
until one of you owns up.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.200
-That's not very productive, miss.
-Neither is slut-shaming your teacher.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.640
Get circling, girls.
I'll be back to check on you.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.040
Have you ever done this before?

12:14.560 --> 12:17.960
No! What are you trying to say?
You slept with me too, you know.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.000
I know, I'm not trying to say anything.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.880
Look, I'm not having your pale,
unusually long children, okay?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.600
-So just go in and get it already.
-Me?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.960
I can't be seen buying
the morning after pill, Otis.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.160
People will talk.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.920
Go on. Go on.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.680
It's important
to tell Dr. Aiken everything.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.920
You might need to up your meds.
You are taking them?

12:45.960 --> 12:47.720
Your mum just asked you
a question.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.240
Yes. I'm taking them.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.200
Well, why didn't you answer her then?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.800
- Shit. Oh, God. I think it's a flat.
- Brilliant, we're gonna be late.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.280
- I can't control it, can I?
- You drive too fast.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.480
I don't need this right now.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.960
So, who's changed a tire before?

13:06.240 --> 13:07.680
It wouldn't be good for my hand.

13:09.760 --> 13:10.720
Brilliant.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.880
Very sensitive sinuses.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.640
And can I get
the morning after pill, please?

13:35.720 --> 13:37.840
-Excuse me?
- The morning after pill?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.600
-I can't hear you.
- The morning after pill.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.080
-I still can't hear you.
- The morning after pill.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.320
I can't sell it to you.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.360
-Why not?
-You don't have a vagina, sir.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.560
It's not... It's nasal spray.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.800
-You need to buy it in person.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.840
What? Why? Ugh!

14:02.920 --> 14:04.320
This is so humiliating.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.440
It's not humiliating.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.080
Okay? I mean,
stuff like this happens all the time.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.880
Condoms break,
or people forget to use them,

14:12.960 --> 14:15.440
or they just go missing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.120
I also want you to know
if you are pregnant

14:18.200 --> 14:21.400
and chose to keep the baby,
I'll quit school, get a job

14:21.480 --> 14:23.080
and provide for you both.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.840
-When did you last have sex?
-Last night.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.120
-Obviously.
-Did you use contraception?

14:31.640 --> 14:32.480
Yes.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.880
-I think so.
- The prophylactic's missing.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.480
Sorry, I'm not here.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.120
-When was your last period?
-Two weeks ago.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.560
Have you taken
the emergency contraceptive pill before?

14:46.640 --> 14:50.960
No. Why do people keep asking me that?
I'm not a slut.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.840
Does anyone in your immediate family
have any health problems?

14:57.440 --> 15:01.280
My dad has MS. He was diagnosed last year.
It's quite bad.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.600
So, can I have the pill or not?

15:12.960 --> 15:14.360
That'll be £25.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.560
It's his penis, he's paying for it.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.000
I am. I am?

15:21.760 --> 15:24.640
-Please don't tell anyone I was here.
-I've no idea who you are.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.720
That's impossible.
Everyone knows who I am.

15:33.120 --> 15:33.960
Mm.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.840
-Right, you've gotta be kidding me.
-Look, I'm just saying,

15:42.920 --> 15:44.560
if you push it in first...

15:44.640 --> 15:47.760
- Mind your hand out of the way.
-Oh, just push it in first, and then--

15:47.840 --> 15:49.920
Oh, my God. This is stupid.
I'm calling them.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.120
-I said we don't have to.
-This is so typical of you.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.720
Why can't you just admit you can't do it?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.080
I can do it.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.160
Well, if you can do it
then why isn't it done?

16:00.480 --> 16:01.840
And why are you laughing?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.640
Because you both just need
to get a divorce.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.920
Why would you say that?

16:09.840 --> 16:10.880
Because it's true.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.560
You fight all the time.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.080
You're so angry at mum,
but you pretend that you're not.

16:17.960 --> 16:18.920
And you're so scared

16:19.000 --> 16:20.480
I won't love you like a biological mum

16:20.560 --> 16:22.800
that you just spend most of your time
pushing us both away.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.720
I just think we'd all be a lot happier
if you just get a divorce.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.760
Yeah, I'll go get her.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.120
Mum!

17:02.720 --> 17:04.160
I'm finished too.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.880
I think you're supposed to circle
all the "A"s,

17:05.960 --> 17:08.520
-not just the singular ones.
-You're so dumb sometimes, Aimee.

17:08.600 --> 17:11.760
-Olivia, do you want this pen in your eye?
- You guys are such clichés.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.440
Except for you, Lily.
You're genuinely weird.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.280
-Thanks.
-What category are you in, Pythagoras,

17:17.360 --> 17:19.720
-other than freak?
-The really, really intelligent one.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.080
Oh, really?

17:21.160 --> 17:23.520
Olivia, Mr. Groff wants to see you.

17:23.600 --> 17:25.480
- Ooh!
-Shut up.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.600
Anyone have anything to admit?

17:32.600 --> 17:36.200
-You can circle the "I"s next.
-Please, Miss Sands. This is pointless.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.600
Okay, you want a challenge?

17:39.160 --> 17:42.560
You can spend the rest of detention
preparing a presentation

17:42.640 --> 17:44.560
on what binds you together as women.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.560
One or all of you wanted to tear
a fellow female down,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.400
now you can spend some time thinking about
what you have in common instead.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.640
-You are joking, right?
-No, I'm not.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.640
You have two hours to enlighten me.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.760
Unless you want a month
of detentions instead?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.360
I'd like you to know
we take these issues

18:07.440 --> 18:09.040
very seriously indeed.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.840
Olivia, come in.

18:17.920 --> 18:22.160
Were you aware that Malek had received
sex advice from Miss Milburn?

18:24.560 --> 18:28.040
Malek Amir talked about his girlfriend
wanting to incorporate...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.160
-fetish--
-Those are my private notes,

18:30.240 --> 18:32.440
and they're not meant to be read
by anybody else.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.560
And I'm sorry,
but I don't know how they were misplaced.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.120
Olivia, do you know
how old your boyfriend is?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.320
He's... He's 16.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.600
Fifteen.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.840
-Fifteen?
-Yeah, I skipped a year in primary school.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.280
-What do you mean "fetish"?
-Amir is not an Indian surname.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.520
We are Iranian.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.320
-Iranian.
-You're 15?

18:52.400 --> 18:56.080
You could go to prison for statutory rape!
This is very serious.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.400
- Iranian?
-Fifteen? What the fuck, Malek?

18:58.480 --> 18:59.600
Okay, Mum...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.800
-We are not going to press charges.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.560
But how could you give sex advice
to children? It's despicable.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.560
I didn't give sex advice.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.000
I answered a question
about a possible fetish.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.840
And I gave the correct information
concerning that subject.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.760
-I... I didn't tell them to do anything--
-You shouldn't have been talking

19:19.840 --> 19:23.280
to 15-year-olds about fetish at all.
This is not what you were employed to do.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.000
And I made that very clear.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.840
-Yes, but my report--
-Is no longer welcome on campus

19:27.920 --> 19:28.880
and nor are you.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.600
-Back to detention, Olivia.
-For God sake!

19:41.360 --> 19:44.120
Can we talk about how exactly
my private notes

19:44.200 --> 19:46.080
got distributed around your campus?

19:46.720 --> 19:47.600
I have no idea.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.480
I could just tell them it was Sex Kid
who gave us the actual advice.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.120
I'm sorry, what?

19:59.680 --> 20:02.760
You know, Otis. His advice
was super strange, but it worked.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.400
But he charges a lot for it though,
which sucks.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.480
Well, that's why I came to you
because you're free.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.680
This is so stupid.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.080
Well, we have to come up with something
if we want to go home.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.560
-Does anybody like fantasy gaming?
-I do.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.240
-I love <i>Dungeons & Dragons.</i>
-Oh, I'm more into

20:26.320 --> 20:27.800
dressing up as Ripley from <i>Alien.</i>

20:27.880 --> 20:29.080
I don't get cosplay.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.800
-What about shopping?
-I hate shopping.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.600
-Me too.
-Can't we just pretend

20:32.680 --> 20:35.080
we're all into shopping or cosplay?

20:35.160 --> 20:36.120
That would be cheating.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.280
We could try a mind map.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.080
- What did Groff want?
-I might be going to prison

20:44.160 --> 20:47.080
because apparently, my boyfriend's 15.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.400
-Anybody else also into younger men?
- What are we doing?

20:52.480 --> 20:54.640
-Figuring out what we have in common.
-... things we all like.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.080
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, are you?

20:58.160 --> 20:59.960
-Yeah, I'm great.
-Great.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.320
It's going well then.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.840
Ugh.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.360
How long have you got?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.760
I gave them an impossible assignment
about female solidarity,

21:14.840 --> 21:17.000
-they won't finish for ages.
-You're so evil.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.600
Say it again.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.080
You're so evil.

21:24.040 --> 21:24.880
Mmm.

21:44.840 --> 21:48.200
The church is very beautiful,
Mrs. Effiong. It's not what I thought.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.760
-Do you attend the mosque?
-Anthea. You can't ask that.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.600
Sorry, Rahim. Just ignore my sister.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.680
-I thought you were Muslim.
-Anthea.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.720
Eric, I don't think
your sister means to be rude.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.480
-I just wanted to know.
-Just... You don't have to answer that.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.320
No, it's okay. My family's atheist.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.600
What's an atheist?

22:06.680 --> 22:09.000
It's someone who believes
that there is no God.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.960
Okay? Shall we be quiet now?

22:16.280 --> 22:18.360
We can't touch each other in church.

22:18.800 --> 22:25.760
<i>♪ We shall meet on that beautiful shore ♪</i>

22:27.720 --> 22:30.360
Don't come over here.
I don't want to talk to you right now,

22:30.440 --> 22:32.840
-hence why I walked away.
-It's ridiculous, Mum.

22:32.920 --> 22:36.520
I just... I need a moment alone, Jackson.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.720
I'm not going anywhere
until we talk, so...

22:41.640 --> 22:44.800
That was the most hurtful thing
you could possibly say to me.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.720
Yeah, I know.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.320
-That's why I said it.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.880
-I didn't mean it, I was just angry.
-No, you did mean it.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.600
-I didn't mean to make you cry, Mum.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.720
I've just always been so afraid
that you would say I wasn't your real mum,

23:02.800 --> 23:05.600
and now you've actually said it,
I'm almost relieved.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.400
-Of course you're my real mum.
-But you didn't come through me.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.960
-So?
-That's why I was so happy

23:10.040 --> 23:12.280
when you said you wanted to swim
because that's my passion,

23:12.360 --> 23:13.920
something we could do together.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.600
I thought it was because
you couldn't compete anymore...

23:18.400 --> 23:20.200
and you were living your dream through me.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.560
Well, maybe there's a bit
of truth in that.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.600
-I genuinely thought you enjoyed it.
-I did enjoy it...

23:29.160 --> 23:30.000
a lot.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.440
Do you know what I enjoyed most
about swimming when I was a kid?

23:36.920 --> 23:38.080
Spending time with you.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.440
You were my hero, Mum.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.600
When we were together,
I felt like I could do anything.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.160
Why did you have to grow up?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.160
-I don't want to swim anymore.
-I know.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.000
It just doesn't make me happy.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.840
But it's got nothing
to do with our relationship, okay?

24:07.080 --> 24:11.240
You've gotta let me figure out who I am
and what else I like to do on my own.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.400
But you'll always, always...

24:18.960 --> 24:20.200
be my real mum.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.600
I got a part in the school play.

24:33.000 --> 24:33.960
-What?
-Yeah.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.800
Playing Romeo.

24:40.600 --> 24:43.680
-Well, you were very believable as Joseph.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.960
-Jessie. No.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.040
-Sit.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.640
Wait.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.080
Wait.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.280
-Sit.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.400
Here you are.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.640
How are you you, New Kid?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.640
Since when do you ask questions?

25:28.720 --> 25:30.720
I'm trying to work on my small talk.

25:40.120 --> 25:40.960
How is he?

25:42.720 --> 25:43.560
Eric?

25:44.920 --> 25:45.800
He's confused.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.840
I don't know what's going on between
the two of you,

25:50.120 --> 25:51.560
but if you hurt him, I'll...

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
I'll mess you up.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.520
I don't want to hurt him anymore.

26:03.040 --> 26:03.880
Then don't.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.120
I said fucking diet.

I'm kind of worried you didn't.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.640
Yes, Otis. I definitely said yes.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.720
When I'm sad, I make out with nerdy boys.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.120
It was 100 percent intentional.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.520
Why nerdy boys?

27:30.160 --> 27:32.880
Because they think they're in love
with me, which feels amazing,

27:32.960 --> 27:35.520
until they get clingy
and want to show me all their things.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.720
I don't think I'm in love with you.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.280
Sure you don't.

27:47.760 --> 27:51.480
Was I... Was I okay at the sex bit?

27:52.360 --> 27:55.000
-It was kind of my first time.
-You're a virgin?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.000
Well, I was.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.880
You weren't great,
but you weren't terrible.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.240
You kept asking me if I was okay.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.960
-It's important to check in.
-It was every ten seconds.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.720
Were you sad because of your dad?

28:21.160 --> 28:22.040
Yeah, a bit.

28:23.680 --> 28:27.280
He had to quit his job,
and my mum's really stressed about it.

28:30.760 --> 28:35.080
But mainly I was upset
because I over-plucked my left eyebrow,

28:35.160 --> 28:36.800
and I'd just got them symmetrical.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.920
They look very even to me.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.520
Thank you for checking in.
A lot of guys don't.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.000
There must be something we all like.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.920
-Chocolate?
-Yes.

29:18.000 --> 29:18.960
No.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.720
Let's just tell Miss Sands that we resent
being grouped together

29:21.800 --> 29:23.760
and forced to bond on the basis
of our gender.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.360
Or I could pretend I like chocolate.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.400
I know you are comfortable
with being dishonest, but I'm not.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.600
What's that supposed to mean?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.800
You pretend to be all radical
and feminist,

29:31.880 --> 29:34.800
when you're just a girl who goes around
stabbing other girls in the back.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.280
-It's not true.
-So, you didn't try

29:38.360 --> 29:41.000
-and steal my boyfriend then?
-Can we not fight?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.840
Shut up. It just got interesting.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.640
I didn't try and steal your boyfriend,
Ola. I had to tell him how I felt.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.640
You didn't have to, Maeve. You chose to.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.280
Did you even like Otis?

29:52.360 --> 29:54.440
Or did you just want to win?
You're a snake.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.480
Yeah? At least I don't pretend
to be so sweet and nice all the time.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.760
You don't know anything about me!

29:59.840 --> 30:02.600
Stop fighting over a stupid boy!

30:03.760 --> 30:04.880
Aimes, why are you crying?

30:07.200 --> 30:09.200
Because I can't get on the bus.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.880
Oh, Aimes. It's okay.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.760
It's okay.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.080
Um, can I come and see you?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.440
I... I'm...

31:02.840 --> 31:04.640
I didn't know who else to talk to.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.320
You can all stop looking at me now.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.600
So you can't get on the bus

31:10.680 --> 31:13.360
because you think
that man's gonna be on it again?

31:13.760 --> 31:18.240
No. It's more that he had
this really kind face.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
I remember because he smiled at me,

31:20.400 --> 31:24.080
and he didn't look like
some wanking psycho killer.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.680
So it's, like, if he could do something
like that, then anyone could.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.640
I always felt safe before,
and now I don't.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.040
-Probably sounds stupid.
-It doesn't sound stupid.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.640
I was groped
at the train station last year.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.000
<i>We were going to a gig in the city,</i>
<i>this group of guys walked past </i>

31:43.080 --> 31:44.640
<i>and one of them grabbed my tit.</i>

31:46.200 --> 31:47.560
<i>And it really, really hurt.</i>

31:48.000 --> 31:49.920
So, I sometimes feel funny in crowds too.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.400
It was like they thought
my body was theirs or something.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.600
Yeah, like we're public property.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.240
A few years ago,
some boys were catcalling me.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.360
<i>This woman told me it was my fault</i>
<i>because my shorts were too revealing.</i>

32:02.840 --> 32:05.200
<i>So I went home</i>
<i>and I cut them even shorter,</i>

32:05.760 --> 32:06.840
because fuck them.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.800
Good. Why should you have to change
your behavior because of what they did?

32:09.880 --> 32:10.800
Exactly.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.280
I used to go to the local swimming pool
all the time when I was a kid.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.320
<i>One day this guy flashed me his penis</i>
<i>in the pool...</i>

32:20.080 --> 32:23.040
<i>and it looked all dangly</i>
<i>and funny under the water.</i>

32:24.840 --> 32:28.080
I told my mum about it,
and she wouldn't let me go back anymore.

32:28.760 --> 32:31.680
It's sad because
the pool was my favorite place to go.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.000
-That's so unfair.
-I guess,

32:34.360 --> 32:38.760
but statistically, two thirds of girls
experience unwanted sexual tension

32:38.840 --> 32:41.880
or contact in public spaces
before the age of 21.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.360
So, it's not unusual.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.680
Why are some men so obsessed
with getting their dicks out?

32:47.160 --> 32:48.720
Sometimes I go on Chat Roulette,

32:48.800 --> 32:50.960
and there are so many flaccid penises
on there.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.600
<i>There are long ones, short ones, fat ones.</i>

32:55.080 --> 32:58.080
<i>There was once even one that looked like</i>
<i>it had a tiny face.</i>

33:04.320 --> 33:07.480
I think if I had an extra arm growing
in between my legs,

33:07.840 --> 33:10.080
-I might want to show everyone too.
- Yeah.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.480
-Maybe it's a power thing.
-Yeah.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.200
I think the man on the bus
liked that I was afraid.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.480
A man followed me home from work
about a year ago.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.080
<i>Every time I sped up, he sped up.</i>

33:26.000 --> 33:26.920
<i>It was so scary.</i>

33:28.040 --> 33:30.640
He ran off when he saw my dad,
which made me angry

33:30.720 --> 33:34.200
because I don't want to be dependent
on another man to protect me.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.760
-I'm sorry that happened to you.
-You too.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.440
Thank you.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.200
At least we can go home now.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.560
Dicks.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.320
-I'll tell you who loves ginger nuts.
-Yeah?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
-Eric Clapton.
-Really?

33:48.480 --> 33:50.400
-Absolutely loves them.
-Are you joking?

33:50.480 --> 33:51.640
Stop!

33:54.720 --> 33:58.160
I only did it 'cause
I love you, and I found out you love him.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.400
He can't offer you what I can, miss.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.880
I have an innate appreciation
for older women,

34:03.960 --> 34:06.720
and I can roll a joint
into the shape of a swan.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.680
That is problematic on so many levels,

34:09.760 --> 34:12.520
but I must say the lipstick
was an ingenious touch.

34:12.600 --> 34:15.800
-You really think so?
-It's not happening, Kyle. Okay?

34:15.880 --> 34:16.760
Follow me.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.240
-I love you.
- Now!

34:27.480 --> 34:28.360
Sit.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.240
-Stand.
-I don't believe it.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.000
Sit.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.640
It's a miracle. Ha!

34:40.720 --> 34:43.160
You're a smart boy.
Why aren't you in school?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.440
I'm no good at school.

34:45.520 --> 34:49.640
Yes, well, you carry on like this,
you're looking at employee of the month.

34:49.720 --> 34:50.760
Huh?

34:50.840 --> 34:54.080
I'm going to go to the movies tonight,
so you can lock up for me.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.280
I'm going to go and get ready.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.600
Girls...

35:11.920 --> 35:13.520
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.120
We've found the culprit.
You may go home now.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.800
I'm very sorry for wasting your time.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.400
Well, great. I knew it.

35:23.320 --> 35:26.840
Oh, out of curiosity,
what did you come up with?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.600
What binds you together?

35:29.240 --> 35:32.600
Other than non-consensual penises, miss,
not much.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.360
-Are you gonna be okay?
-I think so.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.320
I don't feel sad, I just feel angry.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.240
I know something that might help.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.240
I like your family. They're sweet.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.400
What do you mean "sweet"?

35:50.800 --> 35:53.480
The way they believe
in all that God stuff.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.680
They think it's real.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.080
I believe in it too.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.800
Yeah, but not properly.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.080
-You pretend to keep the peace, right?
-No.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.000
No, I believe in God, Rahim.

36:08.920 --> 36:12.320
How can you believe in a god
that doesn't think you should exist?

36:13.960 --> 36:15.480
Okay, this is awkward.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.520
No, my family had to leave their country
because of religion.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.480
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.040
-I didn't know that.
-It's okay.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.280
It's our differences
that make me love you.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.160
We'll agree to disagree.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.280
Love?

36:31.360 --> 36:32.440
Does that freak you out?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.600
No, no, no. Uh...

36:38.040 --> 36:39.080
I... I love you too.

36:40.560 --> 36:41.560
<i>Ah, putain!</i>

36:41.640 --> 36:43.960
-I think my heart stopped for a moment.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.200
Let's go.

36:51.560 --> 36:55.760
I just cannot believe
he's been taking all that money

36:55.840 --> 36:57.520
from all those other students.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.280
I feel like
I don't know him at all, like...

37:00.920 --> 37:03.240
like I've got a stranger
living in my house.

37:03.320 --> 37:08.560
I think we can't ever truly know
these creatures that we created.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.520
-Well, perhaps you're right.
-Talk to him.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.120
That's all you can do.

37:16.920 --> 37:17.760
Hey.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.800
Want to get something to eat after this...

37:21.600 --> 37:22.480
with me?

37:27.720 --> 37:29.800
I'm afraid I can't do that, Jean.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.680
It was one stupid kiss.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.560
You really can't forgive me?

37:42.800 --> 37:43.800
You know...

37:48.080 --> 37:52.320
I may not be as intellectual
as your ex-husband,

37:52.400 --> 37:55.400
but I do know my boundaries.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.520
I can't go through
that kind of pain again.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.320
I'm not sure if I could get up.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.800
-My girls need me.
-Mm.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.120
Mm.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.480
You're not ready
for the kind of intimacy I'm looking for.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.880
Understood.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.600

39:48.840 --> 39:50.760
It's not him, it's you.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.520

39:53.600 --> 39:56.360
like you're trying to be something

40:23.800 --> 40:25.320
and then smash it as hard as you can.

40:27.760 --> 40:28.640
Mmm.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.720

40:34.680 --> 40:36.240

40:36.320 --> 40:37.960

40:40.000 --> 40:43.160
I'm angry that Steve keeps trying so hard
to make things better,

40:43.240 --> 40:44.640
but he doesn't understand.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.000
-Yes! Come on!
-Woo!

40:47.880 --> 40:51.160
I'm angry that a horrible man
ruined my best jeans

40:51.680 --> 40:56.240
and nobody did anything,
and now, I can't get on the fucking bus!

40:56.320 --> 40:57.480

40:57.560 --> 40:59.720

-I'm sorry.
-I did like him...

41:33.560 --> 41:35.840
but I kind of wanted to beat you too.

41:39.720 --> 41:40.760
Let's get you home.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.560
Wanna walk me home?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.440
Yeah.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.120
Hey, Mum.

42:05.760 --> 42:08.920
Are you all right?
I heard about what happened.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.480
Otis.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.880
Have you been giving sex advice
to students at school for money?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.520
What are you talking about?

42:21.360 --> 42:23.880
-Tell me the truth.
-I am.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.480
You look just like your father
when you lie.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.920
-Let's talk about this rationally.
-I can't talk to you right now.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.400
Mum.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.040
Oh, shit!

42:46.120 --> 42:48.360
I didn't think you wanted
to be my friend anymore.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.280
This wasn't in my plan.

42:52.840 --> 42:56.400
Boys that smell a bit sweaty
were in my plan,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.960
not girls that smell like vanilla pods.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.480
-I don't smell like a vanilla pod.
-Yeah, you do.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.240
And car air freshener... sometimes.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.320
You're very clean.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.000
Sorry I confused you, but...

43:12.720 --> 43:14.880
it really hurt
when you started avoiding me.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.120
Fine.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.160
We can still be friends.

43:22.040 --> 43:22.880
Fine.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.600
I'll see you at school then.

43:35.400 --> 43:39.000
Wait. I think I don't wanna be
just friends.

43:39.080 --> 43:39.920
Why?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.160
Because you smell
so much better than a boy.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.560
I just...

44:05.120 --> 44:07.040
-Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

44:07.120 --> 44:09.360
<i>So, your mum's lying about going to work.</i>

44:09.440 --> 44:12.680
<i>I saw her pretending to leave this morning</i>
<i>and sneaking back into the caravan again.</i>

44:12.760 --> 44:13.880
Shit stirrer.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.400
<i>I'm only telling you what I saw.</i>

44:16.080 --> 44:17.120
<i>Take it or leave it.</i>

44:18.920 --> 44:21.560
-Okay. Night, Isaac.
<i>-Good night.</i>

45:08.640 --> 45:10.320
Why do you always double knot?

45:10.400 --> 45:12.240
I don't want you running off, do I?

45:13.400 --> 45:14.680
You're funny.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.240
Ooh!

45:21.320 --> 45:23.120
-Say bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.160
Bye-bye.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.360
All right, 007, enough.

45:28.920 --> 45:29.760
God.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.680
-Hi, Mum.
-Fucking arsehole.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.280
What you doing?

46:01.880 --> 46:04.400
-I had to pop back--
-Isaac told me he saw you yesterday.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.960
I got fired.
I didn't know how to tell you.

46:09.040 --> 46:09.880
Um...

46:10.640 --> 46:12.200
I felt so ashamed.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.440
But... I am looking for something else.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.720
-Are you using again?
-No, I am not.

46:19.600 --> 46:23.640
I swear on my life.
I swear on your life, on Elsie's life.

46:24.600 --> 46:25.640
I'm clean.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.080
Please believe me.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.680
I believe you.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.680
Lie to me one more time, and you're out.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.120
What are you doing here?

46:57.040 --> 46:57.880
Getting the bus.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.720
We're all getting the bus.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.440
- Are you getting on or what?
- Give her a minute.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.960
It's just a stupid bus.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.200
It's just a stupid bus.
