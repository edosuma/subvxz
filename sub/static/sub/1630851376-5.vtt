00:02.707 --> 00:03.849
- Chapter 12--
ever since childhood,

00:03.949 --> 00:06.251
the Hayworth siblings loved
to play games.

00:06.351 --> 00:08.614
And that tradition continued
with game night at Connor's.

00:08.714 --> 00:10.216
Tom and Marina
were looking forward

00:10.316 --> 00:12.498
to an evening of good food,
big laughs,

00:12.598 --> 00:14.060
and making the loser cry.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.983
Babysitter's all set.
We're ready to roll.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.986
- Well, I just ordered
a $29 pizza

00:20.086 --> 00:22.069
for a $30-an-hour babysitter.

00:22.169 --> 00:23.911
I know you can't put
a price tag on fun,

00:24.011 --> 00:27.275
but, oh, I just did,
it's $149.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.237
- Come on,
game night's gonna be great.

00:29.337 --> 00:31.800
Connor bought Giant Jenga,
and then, you know,

00:31.900 --> 00:35.323
maybe later we can make
the night really special.

00:35.423 --> 00:37.246
- All right. We can have sex.

00:37.346 --> 00:38.647
- Oh.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.449
- Oh, you weren't
talking about sex.

00:40.549 --> 00:42.091
- No, I was talking about
playing "Settlers of Catan."

00:42.191 --> 00:46.135
But hey, your idea works, too.

00:46.235 --> 00:48.238
I mean, I like it better.
It works better.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.061
Oh!

00:51.161 --> 00:54.825
- Wow! Good for Connor!

00:54.925 --> 00:57.348
Who is that?
- I don't know.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.450
He didn't tell me
he was dating anybody.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.395
Oh, no.

01:04.495 --> 01:06.518
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:24.357 --> 01:25.819
Connor, you were kissing her.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.181
You go first.

01:27.281 --> 01:28.742
- Okay, well,
a couple of weeks ago,

01:28.842 --> 01:30.064
I was at this tech conference,

01:30.164 --> 01:32.186
and there was a panel
on blockchain regulation,

01:32.286 --> 01:33.828
which, honestly,
it's gonna dampen the growth

01:33.928 --> 01:35.270
of the crypto market.
both: Connor.

01:35.370 --> 01:38.513

there was this intelligent,

She laughs.

We've been dating ever since.

01:46.702 --> 01:48.444
Now, how is she your Jessica?

01:48.544 --> 01:50.326
- Well, she isn't...

01:50.426 --> 01:52.769
not anymore...

01:52.869 --> 01:54.771
but she was.

01:54.871 --> 01:57.454
- What's going on?
- Something dramatic.

01:57.554 --> 01:59.817
- Jessica broke my heart...

01:59.917 --> 02:01.579
at summer camp.

02:01.679 --> 02:04.862
- She's Camp Girl?
I'm gonna need more wine.

02:04.962 --> 02:06.584
- You know about this?
- Vaguely.

02:06.684 --> 02:09.027
He told me, but I always
tuned out the details.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.749
- Hmm.
- It was an idyllic summer--

02:10.849 --> 02:12.350
Camp Caribou.

02:12.450 --> 02:15.674
Each night, the fireflies
would light up the woods.

02:15.774 --> 02:16.956
In the early-morning dawn,

02:17.056 --> 02:19.038
you might catch a glimpse
of a black-tailed deer.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.961
- Why are you talking like
you're narrating a book?

02:22.061 --> 02:24.484
- Because the saga of me
and Jessica

02:24.584 --> 02:26.927
is a chapter in my book,
remember?

02:27.027 --> 02:28.729
It was that summer that Sarah
and I went to Caribou,

02:28.829 --> 02:31.051
you went to that lacrosse camp?
- Best summer ever.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.414
I averaged, like,
three goals a game.

02:33.514 --> 02:34.975
I slept with my stick
every night.

02:35.075 --> 02:37.939
- Jessica and I were
inseparable that summer.

02:38.039 --> 02:40.782
Each night we'd sneak off
down to the lake

02:40.882 --> 02:43.745
and talk about our love
of Stephen King novels

02:43.845 --> 02:44.986
and the Counting Crows.

02:45.086 --> 02:46.869
- I can see why you tuned
out the details.

02:46.969 --> 02:48.390
- Our final night at camp,

02:48.490 --> 02:49.872
we were supposed to meet
at the farewell dance.

02:49.972 --> 02:51.674
I made a leather bracelet
for her.

02:51.774 --> 02:54.597
I even carved
her initials into it.

02:54.697 --> 02:56.599
But Jessica never showed.
- Aww.

02:56.699 --> 02:59.122
You must have been
so sad and cute.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.805
- The next morning we boarded
different busses home,

03:01.905 --> 03:03.527
never to meet again.

03:03.627 --> 03:05.089
I don't know--
I heard this rumor after that

03:05.189 --> 03:07.011
that she'd met this other boy
down at the docks.

03:07.111 --> 03:09.574
It just kind of messed
with my head.

03:09.674 --> 03:11.696
That fall, in got a B-minus
in AP bio,

03:11.796 --> 03:13.218
and I guess that was it.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.499
You know, that was
the beginning of the end.

03:14.599 --> 03:16.661
- Yeah, your life
really went downhill.

03:16.761 --> 03:21.026
You're stuck with three
beautiful children, a hot wife.

03:21.126 --> 03:24.150
- No, no, I mean, come on,
you guys are great.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.674
- "You guys are great"?
- Well, she's coming back.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.636
I invited her to game night.

03:29.736 --> 03:31.438
She just had to go home
and walk her dog.

03:31.538 --> 03:33.280
- Wait, what?
She's coming back here? Now?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.922
- Yeah, should I put on
some Counting Crows?

03:35.022 --> 03:36.603
- Okay.

03:36.703 --> 03:38.325
I'm sorry, man, I don't think
I'm ready for this.

03:38.425 --> 03:40.047
- You had, like, 20 years
to get ready for this.

03:40.147 --> 03:41.208
- Tom, we can't leave.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.411
We're already
60 nonrefundable dollars in.

03:45.874 --> 03:47.936
- Hey!
- What happened to your garage?

03:48.036 --> 03:51.780
- Tom crashed into it after
he saw Connor's new girlfriend.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.502
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

03:53.602 --> 03:55.785
- She must really be something.
- Sarah, it's Jessica.

03:55.885 --> 03:58.107
- Hmm?
- Camp Girl, Jessica.

03:58.207 --> 04:01.871
- [gasps] No frickin' way.
- She must really be something.

04:01.971 --> 04:03.353
- She's coming over here now,
for game night.

04:03.453 --> 04:05.115
- Wow! Wow!

04:05.215 --> 04:06.957
- You remember how brutal
that was for me.

04:07.057 --> 04:08.719
- Yeah, I mean,
you cried on my shoulder

04:08.819 --> 04:10.000
the entire way home from camp.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.042
- Well, not
the entire way home.

04:12.142 --> 04:13.604
- It was, like,
a six-hour drive,

04:13.704 --> 04:14.966
and you sobbed
through my sweater.

04:15.066 --> 04:16.567
Tom, it was traumatic.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.049
I mean, I'm not saying this
just as your sister,

04:18.149 --> 04:20.131
but as a newly employed
therapist,

04:20.231 --> 04:21.973
I don't think it's healthy
for you to see this woman.

04:22.073 --> 04:24.616
- Connor, this is too soon.
- It's been decades.

04:24.716 --> 04:26.018
I'm not uninviting her.

04:26.118 --> 04:28.020
- And the babysitter meter's
running.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.942
- Exactly. You get it.

04:30.042 --> 04:32.345
So what game
are we playing first?

04:32.445 --> 04:34.227
- Oh, I think we should
probably wait for Jessica.

04:34.327 --> 04:36.590
- Man, in my experience,
waiting for Jessica

04:36.690 --> 04:37.791
is not a great idea.

04:37.891 --> 04:39.633
I'm getting a drink.

04:39.733 --> 04:42.476
- That's actually
a pretty good burn, Tom.

04:42.576 --> 04:44.478
- You're paying
30 an hour, too?

04:44.578 --> 04:46.040
But your kids are older.

04:46.140 --> 04:47.602
- Babysitting
is one big hustle.

04:47.702 --> 04:51.967
- Exactly. We have to pay extra
so that they're CPR-certified?

04:52.067 --> 04:53.648
I've never once
seen them use that.

04:53.748 --> 04:55.651
Total rip-off.
- Well...

04:55.751 --> 04:57.653
- And we're going out again
next Friday.

04:57.753 --> 04:59.615
Sofia Salazar is doing
a tasting menu

04:59.715 --> 05:00.656
for her new restaurant.

05:00.756 --> 05:02.218
I'm so tired of her.

05:02.318 --> 05:04.901
If only she weren't a magician
with duck fat.

05:05.001 --> 05:06.983
Maybe you could sit for us.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.665
- Oh, well, we were
actually gonna go

05:08.765 --> 05:09.866
to a friend's gallery show,

05:09.966 --> 05:12.429
and I was gonna ask you
to sit for us.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.111
- Hang on.

05:14.211 --> 05:17.194
Care to make game night
a little more interesting?

05:17.294 --> 05:19.397
- More interesting than
a Tom/Connor love triangle?

05:19.497 --> 05:21.119
What do you got?

05:21.219 --> 05:23.521
- The loser babysits
for the winner next Friday--

05:23.621 --> 05:25.764
whoever wins
the most games tonight.

05:25.864 --> 05:27.125
[clicking tongue]
- Ooh.

05:27.225 --> 05:29.268
Now you're talking.
You got yourself a bet.

05:30.749 --> 05:32.051
- You're gonna regret this.

05:32.151 --> 05:34.574
The wins are
diaper-wrecking machines.

05:34.674 --> 05:36.215
Alejandro's ding-dong
has a mind of its own.

05:36.315 --> 05:37.777
It's like a broken sprinkler.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.058
- We're not gonna be
changing any diapers.

05:39.158 --> 05:40.820
We're gonna be out on the town,

05:40.920 --> 05:43.183
while two moody tweens force
you to learn TikTok dances.

05:43.283 --> 05:44.865
Mm.
- [gasps]

05:44.965 --> 05:47.067
You know, Tom seems fragile.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.029
Maybe we should reschedule.

05:49.129 --> 05:52.393
- Tom always seems fragile.
He's our little teacup.

05:52.493 --> 05:55.236
- Well, I got
some liquid courage--chamomile.

05:55.336 --> 05:57.038
I think I'm gonna be good.
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

05:57.138 --> 05:58.640
- Tom, no need
to put on a brave face.

05:58.740 --> 05:59.761
You don't have to do this.

05:59.861 --> 06:01.123
- Yes, we do.
- We do, Lulu.

06:01.223 --> 06:04.126
- Look, I'm actually excited
to see Jessica.

06:04.226 --> 06:05.648
It's a chance for me
to get closure on something

06:05.748 --> 06:07.650
that's haunted me
for years.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.372
Who did she ditch me for
that night?

06:09.472 --> 06:12.856
- No. No, no, no. Tom, no.
You should not confront her.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.858
I mean, you know,
sometimes closure

06:14.958 --> 06:16.780
is more painful
than it is helpful.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.662
- And I don't want you
to make things weird.

06:18.762 --> 06:21.625
- And I need you
to be sharp tonight.

06:21.725 --> 06:24.228
- Okay.
[slurps]

06:24.328 --> 06:26.991
[grunts] It's a little--
it's a little hot.

06:27.091 --> 06:29.594
- Oh, boy.
So, um, about that wager...

06:29.694 --> 06:31.717
- Mm-mm. We shook on it.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.078
- Every woman
that I'm interested in,

has a problem with.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.322
I mean, first, Lindsay,
now this?

06:36.422 --> 06:38.044
I mean, if you guys
don't want your brother

06:38.144 --> 06:41.047
to date people you know,
stop meeting hot people!

06:41.147 --> 06:43.209
Seriously, though, Tom,
I like Jessica, okay?

06:43.309 --> 06:45.812
Please don't blow
this thing up.

06:45.912 --> 06:48.535
- Yeah, I mean...

06:48.635 --> 06:51.178
look, maybe closure
is overrated.

- Okay.

07:09.778 --> 07:10.920
You see what a mess Tom is?

07:11.020 --> 07:12.281
We cannot lose.
- Lulu...

07:12.381 --> 07:13.763
- Marina and Tom better
have a bucket,

the floor with them.

That's a good line.
I should use that.

wants to find out

ditched him for?

07:20.310 --> 07:21.852
- Yeah.
That's all he can think about.

07:21.952 --> 07:23.654
You can't win game night
when that's on your brain.

07:23.754 --> 07:25.956
- Well, that guy was me.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.143
- Camp Girl was Dock Girl?
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.705
- You didn't tell me Tom
was part of that story.

07:33.805 --> 07:34.906
- Well, I was too embarrassed.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.748
You know, Jessica
was my bunkmate

07:36.848 --> 07:38.430
and my first lesbian crush,

07:38.530 --> 07:41.834
and she was so cool
and pretty and fun.

07:41.934 --> 07:43.436
- And your
brother's girlfriend.

07:43.536 --> 07:45.438
- [sighs] That last night

07:45.538 --> 07:48.401
I went down to the dock
because I was so depressed.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.243
I never thought
I was gonna see her again,

07:50.343 --> 07:53.287
and I-I couldn't tell her
how I felt.

07:53.387 --> 07:57.051
And so I sat there
watching the reflection

07:57.151 --> 07:59.814
of the fireflies
on the water's surface.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.015
- You and Tom are so related.

08:01.115 --> 08:02.417
- And then, suddenly,

08:02.517 --> 08:05.420
through the mist,
there she was.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.384
And she put her arm around me,
and we kissed, and--

08:09.484 --> 08:12.388

for that dance.

If he confronts Jessica
and the truth comes out,

And who knows?

08:26.543 --> 08:28.085
Maybe when Jessica drove off,

08:28.185 --> 08:29.246
she realized
she was dating Connor,

08:29.346 --> 08:31.208
and why would she want
to do that?

08:31.308 --> 08:32.850

08:56.376 --> 08:58.198
- Hey. Oh, wait, did--
[chuckles]

08:58.298 --> 08:59.840

Or--I don't know, did we?
I can't remember.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.644
But maybe you do.
- We did?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.047
- Huh.
- Huh. Tom.

I mean, what are the odds

09:19.241 --> 09:21.344
that I went to camp
with Tom and Sarah,

I put it in,

on the dock.

at the dance,

10:29.279 --> 10:30.500

10:30.600 --> 10:32.142
- Yeah, and you kissed me back.

10:40.331 --> 10:42.313
Oh, no, Jessica,
I'm not hitting on you.

10:42.413 --> 10:45.116
I just wanted to get you alone.
Okay, that sounds bad.

10:45.216 --> 10:46.918

to a storage closet.

10:48.179 --> 10:49.561
Listen, here's the thing--

10:49.661 --> 10:53.886
Tom doesn't know about you
and me and the dock,

10:53.986 --> 10:55.928

it if we kept it that way.

10:56.028 --> 10:58.251
He would be devastated
if he knew

10:58.351 --> 11:01.014
that I was the reason why you
didn't make it to the dance.

11:01.114 --> 11:03.697

- Yeah.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.298
Tom's a writer now,

11:05.398 --> 11:09.303

- Yeah. Tom's a lot.

Kind of dodged a bullet
on that one.

11:14.128 --> 11:15.029

11:15.129 --> 11:16.831
But can we agree
to protect him?

11:16.931 --> 11:18.313
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

11:18.413 --> 11:20.235
- I guess it wasn't
our finest moment.

11:20.335 --> 11:24.159
- No, no, but it was a moment

we should call off the bet.

- No! We are tied.
[buzzer sounding]

16:18.624 --> 16:20.246
Absolutely not.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.488
- When we start game night,
we finish night.

16:22.588 --> 16:24.330
[buzzer sputters]

16:24.430 --> 16:25.972
I think we broke it.

16:26.072 --> 16:26.933
- It's not a good one.
- Ooh.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.335
- Ooh. Ooh.
- You're gonna fail.

16:28.435 --> 16:29.336
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

16:29.436 --> 16:32.099
- No, no, no, no.
all: Oh!

16:32.199 --> 16:33.981
- Pew!
- Okay. All right, calm down.

16:34.081 --> 16:35.663
She has to put it
on the top still.

16:35.763 --> 16:39.627
Don't screw up.
Don't get too nervous.

16:39.727 --> 16:42.130
Oh, my gosh. Don't--no.

16:45.173 --> 16:47.836
- High cinco.
- Matt Stillman couldn't swim.

16:47.936 --> 16:49.558
- Oh, God.
- No, not again.

16:49.658 --> 16:52.762
- Matt Stillman couldn't swim.
He was terrified of water.

16:52.862 --> 16:55.084
Remember he had that meltdown
at that kayak race?

16:55.184 --> 16:57.447
Yet you're saying that the two
of you were swimming around

16:57.547 --> 16:59.369
like a couple of water nymphs?

16:59.469 --> 17:01.812
- Tom, we are
so close to winning.

17:01.912 --> 17:03.413
- Maybe I should go.
- No, no, no.

17:03.513 --> 17:05.976
Tom, you should go.
He just called you a nymph.

17:06.076 --> 17:07.538
- Why can't this be
a normal game night?

17:07.638 --> 17:09.901
- You're acting crazy.
- This is just like "Saw."

17:10.001 --> 17:11.983
This is just like
the movie "Saw."

17:12.083 --> 17:13.785
- So embarrassing. We're, like,
in front of people--

17:13.885 --> 17:17.229
- Embarrassing?
- [all shouting]

17:17.329 --> 17:20.312
- Stop! Stop!
It wasn't Matt Stillman, okay?

17:20.412 --> 17:22.574
It was me. I kissed Jessica.
I'm sorr--

17:29.262 --> 17:31.384
I'm sorry.

17:33.787 --> 17:38.132
- The blocks fell
during your turn, so...

17:38.232 --> 17:40.915
But that's not important
right now.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.139
- You've been hiding this
from me for over 20 years?

17:45.239 --> 17:47.142
- I was hoping that
you would forget about it?

17:47.242 --> 17:48.944
- You dried my tears
on the bus ride home,

17:49.044 --> 17:51.667
and the whole time, you knew
you were the cause of them.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.108
- I'm sorry, okay?

17:53.208 --> 17:55.351
I felt awful about it then,
and I feel awful now.

17:55.451 --> 17:56.993
I didn't mean to betray you.

17:57.093 --> 17:58.554
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know!

17:58.654 --> 18:00.196
I don't know, okay?

18:00.296 --> 18:02.759
I-I had feelings for a girl
for the first time ever,

18:02.859 --> 18:05.482
and...

18:05.582 --> 18:07.985
I was ashamed and confused.

18:10.708 --> 18:13.451
If I told you the truth then,
it would have meant coming out,

18:13.551 --> 18:15.553
and I couldn't even
come out to myself.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.897
- Oh.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.538
I'm sorry.

18:20.638 --> 18:22.861
I-I didn't know.

18:22.961 --> 18:26.305
- It's okay.
You couldn't have known.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.307
- No, I've been self-centered.

18:28.407 --> 18:29.909
I mean...

18:30.009 --> 18:31.390
this whole time I thought

18:31.490 --> 18:35.155
that Jessica was a chapter
in my book, but...

18:35.255 --> 18:38.298
I mean, she's really
a chapter in yours.

18:40.701 --> 18:42.703
- Thank you.

18:44.064 --> 18:46.247
- You want to--
Should we hug?

18:46.347 --> 18:49.170
- No, not really.
- Oh, okay.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.272
Come here.

18:54.075 --> 18:56.538
Look, Sarah, we got to be
more open with each other.

18:56.638 --> 18:58.460
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.942
- Is there anything else
from the past

19:00.042 --> 19:01.984
that you want
to get off your chest?

19:02.084 --> 19:03.586
- Stop.
No, that was it.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.668
- Okay.

19:05.768 --> 19:08.071
- I'm the one
who broke Dad's train set.

19:08.171 --> 19:12.356
- I got grounded for that!
- I know. Choo-choo!

19:12.456 --> 19:13.837
- Well, I would've won

19:13.937 --> 19:16.200
if your husband was capable
of normal human behavior.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.843
- Hey, I take
no pleasure in this.

19:18.943 --> 19:22.166
That's a lie. I am taking
so much pleasure in this.

19:22.266 --> 19:23.968
- This is not
a good look on you.

19:24.068 --> 19:28.453
- You ditched my brother
to kiss my sister.

19:28.553 --> 19:29.775
- Is that weird for you?
- No.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.817
Come on, it was, like,
a million years ago.

19:31.917 --> 19:35.341
And unlike them, I'm actually
a functioning adult.

19:35.441 --> 19:38.144
- It's quite a family.
- You have no idea.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.907
- Maybe our next date
can be just the two of us.

19:41.007 --> 19:43.630
- Why, was this night
not romantic enough for you?

19:43.730 --> 19:45.752
- [chuckles]

19:45.852 --> 19:48.556
- Hey, I'm making
Peanut Butter White Russians.

19:48.656 --> 19:50.318
Who wants some?

19:50.418 --> 19:52.320
- Uh, yes, please.
- Yeah.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.562
- You don't spend
that much time

19:54.662 --> 19:55.844
with your siblings, do you?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.686
- No. No, no, no.
Of course not.

19:57.786 --> 19:59.608
Yeah, we only do game night,
like, once a month.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.009
- Oh.

20:01.109 --> 20:03.332
- I guess we do do brunch
every weekend.

20:03.432 --> 20:05.094
And Sarah I see
all the time now,

20:05.194 --> 20:06.656
'cause she's actually
a counselor

20:06.756 --> 20:08.097
at my daughter's school.

20:08.197 --> 20:09.859
For Halloween, we're all going
trick-or-treating

20:09.959 --> 20:10.820
with the kids.

20:10.920 --> 20:11.861
We're doing, like,
a group theme.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.303
I'll put you on
the costume thread.

20:13.403 --> 20:15.665
And Marina I watch
all the 49ers games with.

20:15.765 --> 20:18.949
Denise, she's, like,
a adviser/consultant

20:19.049 --> 20:20.110
to my business now.

20:20.210 --> 20:21.472
And sometimes
we'll just call each other,

20:21.572 --> 20:24.155
just out of the blue,
for no reason, just to say hi.

20:24.255 --> 20:26.257
- [chuckles awkwardly]

20:28.059 --> 20:29.601
- This isn't gonna work,
is it?

20:29.701 --> 20:31.883
- [exhales sharply]

20:31.983 --> 20:33.986
It was fun.

20:34.626 --> 20:38.050
- Okay, who's ready
for an early bedtime?

20:38.150 --> 20:40.533
[babies crying]
Wonderful.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.095
- Look, we shouldn't
be that late.

20:42.195 --> 20:43.776
And if you want to order pizza
or something, that's cool.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.178
We'll pay you back.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.380
- Tom, we won the bet.
you don't have to be nice.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.702
- Hold on.

20:48.802 --> 20:52.306
I have a proposition for you.

20:52.406 --> 20:54.628
Double or nothing--
two months of babysitting.

20:54.728 --> 20:56.030
No blackout dates,

20:56.130 --> 20:58.393
no heads-up, no pretending
like you're not home.

20:58.493 --> 21:00.955
- Two months?
- Two months.

21:01.055 --> 21:02.557
- What about dinner with Sofía?

21:02.657 --> 21:04.239
I mean, technically,
she's my boss.

21:04.339 --> 21:06.682
- Two months
of babysitting, Tom.

21:06.782 --> 21:09.645
Set it up.
- Uh, what's happening?

21:09.745 --> 21:11.968
- Well, looks like
it's game night again.

21:12.068 --> 21:14.410
Hey, uh, you never met
my college girlfriend, did you?

21:14.510 --> 21:15.892
[both chuckle]

21:15.992 --> 21:17.454
- Arianna.

21:17.554 --> 21:19.696
How could I forget?
- All right.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.939
[chuckles] Very funny.
- Mm.

21:22.039 --> 21:23.500
- Just to clarify,
that was a--

21:23.600 --> 21:25.603
that was a joke, right?
