I really don't want to get stuck in
a room with my pants down again.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.731
- I'm willing to risk it.
- Is that all you're willing to risk?

10:12.742 --> 10:13.840
Nic.

10:13.851 --> 10:16.247
- I'm trying.
- This was never our problem.

10:16.257 --> 10:18.583
- Then what was?
- Not here, not now.

10:18.593 --> 10:19.694
Okay.

10:21.647 --> 10:23.932
I took this at Lane's clinic.

10:26.034 --> 10:28.383
Look at these dosages,
they are extremely high.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.367
That's not just dose
intensification protocol.

10:30.378 --> 10:32.195
I mean, there's something else going on.

10:32.206 --> 10:35.534
Cary Michaels, 2015, diagnosed
with stage IV liver cancer,

10:35.544 --> 10:36.581
three months to live.

10:36.592 --> 10:40.606
Still alive today thanks
to Lane's high dosage protocol.

10:40.616 --> 10:42.212
I don't get your obsession with this.

10:42.223 --> 10:44.242
Well, I do get that you're loyal to her,

10:44.252 --> 10:46.211
but we both know oncologists
make a huge profit

10:46.221 --> 10:47.525
from the drugs they prescribe.

10:47.536 --> 10:49.581
More chemo, more money.

10:49.591 --> 10:51.075
That's an awful accusation,

10:51.086 --> 10:53.385
and it'll never stand up
to her outcomes.

10:53.395 --> 10:56.789
(SIGHS) I'm worried about Lily.

BELL: Technology is
making everything easier

11:02.304 --> 11:05.097

are being abandoned.

11:05.107 --> 11:08.100
The Bell 2.0 is...

11:08.849 --> 11:10.635
the perfect marriage.

11:10.645 --> 11:12.236
Is there such a thing?

11:12.246 --> 11:13.639

11:13.804 --> 11:15.628

11:15.639 --> 11:18.577
in all forms of surgery, even neuro.

11:18.587 --> 11:20.578
Now, in terms of...

In terms of market potential...

11:30.288 --> 11:34.616
Dr. Bell, I don't want to waste
any more of your time or mine.

11:34.969 --> 11:37.829
Perhaps this tool will be
a great legacy for you.

11:37.839 --> 11:40.698
Legacy is not my objective.

11:40.708 --> 11:43.802
Improving surgical conditions is.

11:43.812 --> 11:46.204
It's too risky of an
improvement for my tastes.

11:46.214 --> 11:48.029
Oh, surely you know the biggest risk

11:48.040 --> 11:49.707
- is not taking any.
- You can talk to me

11:49.717 --> 11:51.782
about risk when it's
your money on the line.

11:51.801 --> 11:54.177
BELL: Right. What do I know about risk?
I'm a surgeon.

11:54.188 --> 11:56.814
CLAIRE: The good news
is that we have a number

11:56.824 --> 11:58.831
of hospital wings
that could bear your name.

11:58.842 --> 12:01.886
Well, vanity investments
aren't as attractive to me

12:01.896 --> 12:04.990
as judicious ones.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.357
Cancer.

12:06.703 --> 12:08.025
Tell me about it.

12:08.035 --> 12:10.062

to other parts of the body.

12:14.688 --> 12:17.202
I'm quite sure he knows what cancer is,

12:17.212 --> 12:19.504
but did you know it was our
number one revenue stream?

12:19.514 --> 12:20.849
I'm listening.

12:21.162 --> 12:24.076
I'll contact Dr. Lane Hunter,
Head of Oncology,

12:24.086 --> 12:26.745
and have her give you a
tour of our new facility

12:26.755 --> 12:29.180
and tell you more.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.550
Best of luck with your tool, Dr. Bell.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.386
I hope cancer treats you well, Marshall.

- So, Doctor,

12:43.405 --> 12:45.396
will Ed's package look the same or...?

12:45.406 --> 12:46.441
Exactly the same.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.457
- Well, not if I choose this one here.
- Oh, God.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.832

12:50.847 --> 12:53.735
It might actually throw off
your anatomical balance. So...

12:53.746 --> 12:55.841
It's kind of like bad wheel alignment.

12:55.851 --> 12:57.375
You'd be drifting to the left.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.507
You know, I have an idea.

12:58.518 --> 13:00.499
Why don't I just get,
like, a triple "D" implant,

13:00.510 --> 13:02.804
but only in my right boob. That way,

13:02.815 --> 13:04.429
we'd always be moving
towards each other.

scary, but your CT scan confirms.

I'm pretty jammed up today.

How urgent is it?

Nic, I already told you, we
transfer Christine to St. Joe's.

17:00.768 --> 17:02.358
I reached out to Dr. Reyes.

17:02.368 --> 17:04.580
He has an opening, no HODAD,
everybody wins.

17:04.592 --> 17:06.102
You can't make crazy moves like that.

17:06.113 --> 17:07.696
You send a patient to another hospital

17:07.707 --> 17:09.934
and Claire will swallow
your medical career whole.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.867
No one needs to know;
my plan is bulletproof.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.483
Unless you get shot down in the process.

17:13.493 --> 17:15.557
You're getting awfully cautious
these days, brother.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.176
You're getting awfully
reckless, brother.

17:17.188 --> 17:19.273
A little reminder, we'll all
on the same team here.

17:19.285 --> 17:20.944
Look, it sounds like Christine's stable,

17:20.954 --> 17:22.546
so I'll do her surgery after Gus.

17:22.556 --> 17:24.380
It'll be tight, but it's doable.

17:24.390 --> 17:25.983
She's gonna need to request a switch

17:25.992 --> 17:27.778
- or Bell will come for my head.
- Of course.

17:27.789 --> 17:29.218
All right, sounds good?

17:29.228 --> 17:31.588
- Yeah, thanks.
- No. "Tight" sounds like

17:31.598 --> 17:34.102
- a disaster waiting to happen.
- Well, I wasn't asking you.

17:34.113 --> 17:35.279
Well, I'm telling you

17:35.290 --> 17:37.237
that making medical choices
for the wrong reasons

17:37.248 --> 17:39.917
- isn't very smart, Silva.
- And what exactly does that mean, huh?

17:39.928 --> 17:42.510
Conrad, it's the right call.
He's just trying to help.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.244
I'll see Christine in surgery.

18:12.839 --> 18:14.964
All funded by cancer patients?

And an early investment
in a groundbreaking drug for lymphoma.

18:18.105 --> 18:19.435
I love breaking ground.

18:19.445 --> 18:20.704
Well, that's encouraging.

18:20.714 --> 18:22.505
As I tell all investors,

18:22.515 --> 18:25.384
you need to be driven by
the desire to care for patients

18:25.395 --> 18:27.095
as well as for the return,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.547
since most of these drugs never
really make it to market.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.350
Dr. Lane, I don't like many people,

18:33.361 --> 18:34.952
but I like you.

18:34.962 --> 18:37.555
So I'll be brutally honest. (SIGHS)

18:37.566 --> 18:41.058
I'm driven by one thing:
betting on the right horse.

18:41.068 --> 18:44.895
It requires my full focus
and a lot of personal sacrifice.

18:44.905 --> 18:47.196
(CHUCKLING): Just ask
my ex-wife and son.

18:47.206 --> 18:48.999
Success comes with a price.

18:49.588 --> 18:52.235
And sometimes, that price is family.

18:52.245 --> 18:55.339
But, Doctor, you have
my undivided attention.

18:55.349 --> 18:56.740
It doesn't happen often.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.341
What do you have to offer?

18:58.351 --> 18:59.810
I'm happy to give you a breakdown

19:12.564 --> 19:14.524
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:14.534 --> 19:18.829
I just... I got a lot going on and...

19:18.839 --> 19:20.864
but now I'm all good.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.796
Really? 'Cause about an hour ago,

19:22.807 --> 19:25.002
you looked like you were gonna
punch Jude in the face.

19:25.012 --> 19:27.813
Oh, I just was trying to do
the best thing for Christine

19:27.824 --> 19:29.505
and you and Jude, you weren't into it,

19:29.515 --> 19:32.376
- so I let it go.
- You know it's okay to talk

19:32.386 --> 19:35.678
about things other than
patients and medicine.

19:35.688 --> 19:37.781
We can talk about our lives.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.093
Not a sign of weakness.
You get that, right?

19:42.295 --> 19:44.307
Okay, okay.

19:44.318 --> 19:46.589
Go ahead. Fire away.

19:46.599 --> 19:47.925
Tell me about your mom.

19:48.747 --> 19:50.841

- Mom or Dad, you pick,

19:50.852 --> 19:52.862
because, honestly, after all this time,

19:52.872 --> 19:54.964
I still don't know much
about either of them.

19:54.974 --> 19:57.733
My parents split.
My dad kept me from my mom

19:57.743 --> 19:59.802
and then she passed away. You know that.

19:59.812 --> 20:01.581
Dad, well...

20:07.203 --> 20:08.978
I hate him.

20:10.188 --> 20:11.681
You would, too.

20:13.329 --> 20:14.415
Why?

20:14.952 --> 20:16.297
Because he's the last guy

anyone would want as a father
