GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.431

SHOUTED AT CINDY ON THE PLANE

21:59.143 --> 22:03.017

22:03.017 --> 22:05.933
SHE WASN'T WORTH
HIS $400 T-SHIRT.

22:05.933 --> 22:10.198
AND AS SOON AS CINDY TOLD ERICH
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT,

22:10.198 --> 22:12.156
SHE BECAME A LIABILITY.

22:12.156 --> 22:16.639
HER ANDA BABY ON THE WAY?

22:16.639 --> 22:19.163
THE SOLUTION HE CHOSE

22:19.163 --> 22:22.515
WAS TO BREAK HER NECK
WITH HIS BLACK-BELT HANDS

AND THROW HER
DOWN HER OWN STAIRS

22:24.647 --> 22:27.171

AND HER CHILD'S

22:32.525 --> 22:37.138
WHILE HIS SEMEN
WAS STILL IN HER MOUTH.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.925

22:41.925 --> 22:44.275
OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER,
DR. BURNSIDE,

22:44.275 --> 22:47.278
THAT CINDY DIED
WITHIN 15 TO 20 MINUTES

22:47.278 --> 22:50.760
AFTER SHE HAD ORAL SEX
WITH THE DEFENDANT.

22:50.760 --> 22:55.461

HE LIED TO POLICE. HUH?

22:55.461 --> 22:59.116
AND TOLD THEM HE HADN'T SEEN HER
SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE

22:59.116 --> 23:03.120
WHEN HE HUMILIATED HER
AND ASSAULTED HER

23:03.120 --> 23:06.472
AND -- AND FIRED HER FROM
THE CREW OF HIS PRIVATE PLANE,

23:06.472 --> 23:11.085
SO BIG THAT IT NEEDED TWO PILOTS

23:11.085 --> 23:12.782

BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT --

23:18.788 --> 23:21.922
THAT ERICH BLUNT IS A RICH MAN.

23:21.922 --> 23:26.405
THE REST OF THE STATE'S CASE
