00:01.760 --> 00:03.759
You ever hear of necro-porn?

00:03.880 --> 00:07.039
This is what they're going to do to Jenny.
This afternoon.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.799
Jenny Jones.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.679
Help!

00:11.800 --> 00:15.639
To keep you safe,
they put you in here.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.439
Well, it is a secure hospital, John.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.039
As secure as a prison?

00:21.160 --> 00:23.559
One can only assume so.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.159
- Well, we know he loves the attention.
- You're gonna want to see this.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.919
It's happening right now. It's live.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.079
No! No!

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:16.160 --> 01:17.479
He fought.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.039
Yeah, well. He's tough, isn't he?

01:23.160 --> 01:26.479
John, our anger's got no place here.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.879
I need you to be functioning fully
in the moment, or not here at all.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.919
We owe that to Ripley.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.519
Making a body disappear is not
that easy, especially in the city.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.599
Cameron took a risk. Was it worth it?

01:42.720 --> 01:46.039
- Worth it how?
- This, all this...

01:46.160 --> 01:47.519
circus!

01:47.640 --> 01:49.919
No, this is staged.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.559
Justin's alive.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.799
Cameron wants him, needs him.

01:56.720 --> 02:01.799
If Justin knows how to read Cameron,
then he'll know how to stay alive.

02:23.080 --> 02:28.679
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

02:30.400 --> 02:36.439
♪ For the ones that feel it the most

02:36.560 --> 02:42.639
♪ Look at her with her eyes like a flame

02:43.720 --> 02:49.599
♪ She will love you
like a fly will never love you. ♪

04:37.680 --> 04:39.559
Agh!

04:43.400 --> 04:46.399
A huge police search
for a missing officer is under way.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.879
Significant resources are being employed
to find 32-year-old Detective Sergeant...

04:50.000 --> 04:53.079
- Let's go over it again.
- ...allegedly abducted last night...

04:53.200 --> 04:54.999
So what do we know?

04:55.120 --> 04:58.159
OK, Pell works long hours, minimum wage.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.199
He cleans corporate offices in the City.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.159
That makes sense, doesn't it?
Big office, midnight.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.919
He's got all of London
to stare at and fantasise about.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.079
- Spending patterns.
- Bit weird.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.239
He lives very frugally. Actually manages
to save a bit every month,

05:14.360 --> 05:15.759
and then eight, nine months ago,

05:15.880 --> 05:19.199
he gets a huge cash injection,
we're talking 65 grand.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.359
Cash arrives in his account
nine months after his mother dies.

05:22.480 --> 05:27.399
Right, so it's his mother's estate.
What did he do with the money?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.439
Withdraws it.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.879
- All of it?
- Every penny.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.599
He wasn't saving up for a rainy day. He
was saving for something to do with this.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.839
- Talk to me about this artwork.
- Ex-wife gives it to us. We have...

05:39.520 --> 05:41.039
...Answer To A Job,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.399
The Integration Of The Personality,

05:43.520 --> 05:48.719
Des Anima Des
Schicksalsproblem Des Mannes, Aion.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.879
So his room's not just empty.
It's in his work too.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.519
An absence. It's empty...rooms.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.519
Ripley's gone, empty car.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.079
Empty roads.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.639
Spring-Heeled Jack, disappeared into
folklore because he was never caught.

06:12.760 --> 06:17.479
Jack the Ripper, he was a myth too, but
I think Cameron is gonna try and disappear

06:17.600 --> 06:20.159
and haunt us with his absence.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.599
We need to stop trying to predict
what he's gonna do next

06:24.720 --> 06:28.359
and work backwards instead.
It costs money to make a new identity,

06:28.480 --> 06:31.759
so we follow the money,
the missing 65 grand.

06:31.880 --> 06:32.999
We follow that and we find him.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.519
Start off with the contacts
that he made in prison.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.679
Ah, the whore's mummy.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.839
Paul Hoby's his name.

08:05.720 --> 08:06.719
Shut up!

08:06.840 --> 08:09.519
Shut up! It's Ripley's phone.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.159
Benny.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.679
Hello.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.999
I'm sorry
you made me hurt your puppy.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.479
He's a noisy little customer, isn't he?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.999
- Guv, he might be...
- Don't.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.359
Don't answer that.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.839
Don't answer that!

08:55.960 --> 08:57.199
He's trying to make contact.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.159
He might be trying to reach out,
he might be trying to stop.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.599
- No, he's not gonna stop.
- How do you know that?

09:01.720 --> 09:05.039
Listen, if you answer that phone,
Cameron's got our attention.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.799
He thinks he's setting up
a relationship with us.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.719
As soon as he thinks that,
he doesn't need Ripley.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.079
- This is...
- DS Gray, do not pick up that phone!

09:13.200 --> 09:14.479
That's it!

09:33.360 --> 09:35.759
I know you're there.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.559
I know you're listening. I don't know
what you're trying to achieve.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.599
I'm opening up a dialogue here.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.039
Trying to find a way through this,
trying to find

09:45.160 --> 09:48.999
a way you can get
your friend back in one piece.

09:49.120 --> 09:55.479
What happens to Ripley,
if you ignore me, will be on your head.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.679
And I will send you pictures of every cut,
every burn, every incision.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.319
I will send you every second
of him screaming.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.599
How much more of this can you take?

10:14.720 --> 10:17.159
You have ten seconds
to answer this phone.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.439
If you do not answer,
then Ripley here will regret it.

10:20.560 --> 10:26.879
Nine seconds. Eight. Seven. Six. Five.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.999
Four. Three.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.119
Two.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.999
One.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.279
Pick up the phone! Pick up the phone!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.359
I am here!

10:48.480 --> 10:50.199
I am...

10:53.560 --> 10:57.479
No. That man, that voice, those voices,

10:57.600 --> 11:01.639
that's the man we're gonna leave on the
streets if we do not do our jobs properly.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.399
This isn't about DS Ripley.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.999
It's about Sadie. It's about Abby.
It's about Jason.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.719
It's about all the others
that will be next if we mess this up.

11:13.760 --> 11:19.279
Listen, DS Ripley knows that
and he wouldn't have it any other way,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.199
so, if you respect him at all...

11:22.640 --> 11:24.039
...just get back to work.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.359
What if Pell regards your silence
as weakness rather than strength?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.199
He won't.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.119
From DS Gray.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.559
He cancelled his mobile phone contract
a few days after his mother's death

11:59.680 --> 12:01.879
and then, ten days after the funeral,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.039
he was contacted on that number
by an ex-cellmate, Paul Hoby.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.439
Excellent.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.879
Hi, erm...

12:13.000 --> 12:15.399
- You have to come to mine now.
- I can't.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.399
You have to.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.599
All right, I'll see what I can do.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.359
Your boss is throwing you to the wolves.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.359
Why would he do that, huh?

12:45.120 --> 12:46.239
Why would he do that?

12:46.360 --> 12:50.799
Huh?! Why would he abandon you
like that? Why? Why?

12:52.840 --> 12:56.919
It's me! Doesn't he know the real thing
when he sees it?!

13:04.720 --> 13:09.239
You must know that phrase,
"the banality of evil".

13:09.360 --> 13:12.479
- I've heard it mentioned, yeah.
- It's a platitude.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.879
Just bourgeois fatuousness.
Do you know what the problem really is?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.119
No, I'd like you to explain that,
Cameron, yes, please.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.159
It's about the evil of banality.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.359
Nothing means anything.

13:25.920 --> 13:31.479
Everybody is numb. This is a dead city.
In a dead country. Do you know why?

13:31.600 --> 13:35.919
Because we've become disconnected
from our own myths.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.159
We have lost our own shadows.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.799
The Ripper. Crippen. Christie. Hindley.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.559
Brady. Sutcliffe. Neilson. Fred and Rose.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.759
They weren't myths. They were people.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.519
They were people,
and their victims were people.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.919
In the beginning.
But murder transfigured them.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.719
Made them numinous.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.199
We needed them.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.199
They told us stories about ourselves,
about...

14:06.880 --> 14:09.079
...about our fears and our desires.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.319
They cast a shadow.
Shadows give us depth.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.759
And I have worked so hard
to become shadows.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.239
I do not want them to ruin it now. So...

14:20.360 --> 14:25.359
the reason you are here, what I want you,
what I need you to tell me...

14:29.320 --> 14:31.039
...is how much do they know?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.719
How much do they know about what?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.399
How much do they know
about what I am about to do?

14:36.520 --> 14:38.919
What are you about to do?

14:45.000 --> 14:45.999
Oh.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.079
Well, I know who you are.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.439
Frank Hodge.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.279
You were a copper.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.879
Different life, John.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.399
All right.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.759
- All right, John, you know how...
- What are you doing? No!

15:11.880 --> 15:13.559
- Get on that chair!
- I said stop pointing!

15:13.680 --> 15:14.719
- All right!
- Now!

15:14.840 --> 15:15.959
- Now!
- All right.

15:16.080 --> 15:19.039
Oi! No! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:19.160 --> 15:21.239
No! Oi! No!

15:21.360 --> 15:24.119
Argh! Argh!

15:35.800 --> 15:39.559
I gather you're the policeman
that stole my property.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.799
Jenny's not your property.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.039
You don't know what you've done, do you?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.639
Got my daughter back.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.359
Jenny is...very...low

15:55.480 --> 15:59.239
on your food chain. This time last night,
you didn't even know she existed.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.159
Let a man steal an egg,
tomorrow he'll steal an ox.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.959
Yeah, but you set me up, didn't you?
You set me up to steal from you.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.359
You talked to Caroline. You knew
she'd come to me and you knew...

16:08.480 --> 16:09.519
you knew what I'd do.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.399
No matter how much temptation
I put in your path,

16:12.520 --> 16:16.639
the fact remains you stole from me
as an act of free will.

16:16.760 --> 16:21.999
This is Toby. My grandson.
He has a friend.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.479
Andrei Kolchak. One of our licensees.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.519
Arrested for people trafficking,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.919
he's currently in witness protection,
finalising his deal.

16:35.040 --> 16:39.119
And when that deal is completed,
he intends to implicate Toby here

16:39.240 --> 16:42.559
in a number of unlawful acts
and sundry violations.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.639
I'd be grateful if that didn't happen.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.839
I'm sorry. All right?

16:50.880 --> 16:52.399
But I can't do anything about that.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.279
Well, then, Caroline here dies.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.039
And the slut child dies.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.479
I could step outside, make one phone call
and have a thousand coppers

17:02.600 --> 17:05.358
- abseiling through your windows.
- I'd make my one phone call,

17:05.480 --> 17:08.839
have my one conversation
and, in eight hours, I'd be out.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.679
The whore's mother would still be dead.
And the whore would still be dead.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.479
Look, this sort of thing,
I can't do it overnight. It needs time.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.118
No, it has to be done today.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.959
And if I do help?

17:24.079 --> 17:25.479
Slate's clear.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.199
Streetwalker's all yours.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.239
The mother's all yours.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.039
Benny?
Yeah, I need you to do something for me.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.799
Yeah, it is one of them, yeah.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.799
All right, yes, it is.

18:05.920 --> 18:09.399
Erm, Andrei Kolchak.
Arrested in the last week or three.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.599
Yeah, I need you to find the safe house

18:11.720 --> 18:13.799
where they're keeping him
and cover up your tracks.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.479
You don't want no-one sniffing
around you, all right? Oh, God!

18:18.840 --> 18:20.199
Oh...!

18:30.600 --> 18:31.599
Morning, officer.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.839
- I don't believe we've met before.
- Well, I'm familiar with the species.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.479
DS Gray, this is Paul Hoby.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.119
Paul used to own a little factory

18:42.240 --> 18:46.199
for converting replica weapons
into working guns.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.119
Yes, and Paul did his time.

18:49.240 --> 18:52.519
What is it with boys and knives, I wonder?

18:52.640 --> 18:56.359
These knives are sold for recreational
and hobby purposes only.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.719
- Yeah? How's the stockroom looking?
- Eh?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.519
- Everything in order?
- Everything in order? Ha!

19:02.640 --> 19:05.959
Seriously, Mein Herr?
Ja, everything is in order.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.119
Would you like to see my papers?

19:08.240 --> 19:09.919
Would if I could.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.719
Right now, I'll settle for a full
inventory and a glimpse at the books.

19:13.840 --> 19:17.319
Please yourself, love. Goose-step
over here, take a look for yourself.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.319
DS Gray is
a little testy today, Paul...

19:22.760 --> 19:27.479
...because of Cameron Pell,
your former cellmate.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.759
Pell's been killing people.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.999
He may have killed a police officer.

19:35.320 --> 19:40.519
Do you have any idea
of what your life will be like

19:40.640 --> 19:44.559
if every London copper
holds you responsible for that?

19:48.760 --> 19:53.919
All I did was point him
in the direction of a few names

19:54.040 --> 19:57.279
who might have been able
to help him with what he wanted.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.959
What names?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.719
You need to talk to a man
called Ronald Bryson.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.119
As speculation mounts as to
why the search for the missing officer

20:09.240 --> 20:13.519
has been so quickly scaled down,
police sources are refusing to comment...

20:17.800 --> 20:20.919
They've stopped looking for you.
Why is that?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.199
If they target the manpower
in certain areas,

20:25.320 --> 20:25.719
you'll know how close they are
to finding you.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.879
You'll know how close they are
to finding you.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.599
Do you think they're close to finding me?

20:31.720 --> 20:32.839
Do you?

20:34.520 --> 20:37.319
Do they know where it goes next?

20:37.440 --> 20:40.399
- I don't know.
- Do you know where it goes next?

20:40.520 --> 20:41.999
- No!
- Any idea?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.119
- Any inkling?
- No. No.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.119
- Would you like to know?
- I'd love to know.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.559
Why?

20:51.800 --> 20:56.279
Because you're one of a kind. If this
situation was turned on its head...

20:57.440 --> 21:00.039
...I'd want your permission
to write a book about you.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.919
A thesis maybe.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.759
I think you'd be of interest
to a lot of people in my field.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.159
Law enforcement psychology.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.839
The first thing I'd ask...

21:13.120 --> 21:15.439
Why the mask? Why do you need a mask?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.919
Because wearing a mask makes it easy.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.999
How you feeling?

21:36.440 --> 21:38.479
Like a freshly squeezed zit.

21:40.080 --> 21:44.159
Do you want something?
Water or painkillers or something?

21:44.280 --> 21:46.359
- Got any temazepam?
- No.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.279
Could do with some of that myself.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.239
How many? I'll sort you out.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.319
Call my mate, Fuzzy Rob.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.399
I'm gonna ask you a question.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.119
Don't ask me questions.
I hate questions.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.559
Do you want out?

22:10.600 --> 22:11.799
Of what?

22:12.800 --> 22:13.839
Of this.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.799
Dream on, dreamer.
These people cut off your ears for 50p.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.239
Say I can make it happen?

22:24.160 --> 22:27.119
I'd have to do things that...

22:27.240 --> 22:29.679
...I shouldn't don't do,
but, if I'm gonna do it,

22:29.800 --> 22:32.799
then I really, really need to know
you want this to be different.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.479
You lying?

22:38.480 --> 22:40.359
Cos, if you're lying,
I swear I'll throw up.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.079
No, I'm not.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.919
Is this some sort of rescue type thing?

22:50.040 --> 22:52.159
Don't ask questions.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.159
I don't like questions.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.559
- You're just totally disco.
- Yeah, he is totally disco.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.279
- So you're all right with this?
- Nobody gets hurt, right?

23:03.400 --> 23:06.239
- No. Not if we do it right.
- You can't think of another way?

23:06.360 --> 23:10.199
- Not in time.
- So let's disco.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.199
What was that?

23:25.640 --> 23:28.279
Oh, you're joking!
Keep an eye on him.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.759
- Oi! Oi! Oi!
- Is it yours?

23:37.880 --> 23:39.879
- Yeah, it's mine.
- I'm really sorry.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.919
- How on earth have you managed this?
- Well, I was doing a three-point turn...

23:44.040 --> 23:45.239
How fast were you going,

23:45.360 --> 23:47.599
- for God's sake?!
- No, no, no. No speed at all.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.919
A squirrel just came out
right in front of me.

23:50.040 --> 23:53.559
- What you talkin' about? A squirrel!
- Honestly, it wasn't my fault.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.319
I'm really sorry,
but it really wasn't my fault.

24:28.440 --> 24:32.719
- Look at the angle you're parked at.
- How is this parked at an angle?

24:32.840 --> 24:34.119
This is parallel parking!

24:48.320 --> 24:52.239
Andrei, get to a safe position.
Now! Hurry! Hurry!

24:57.800 --> 25:01.639
You've been telling stories
out of school, haven't you, Andrei?

25:01.760 --> 25:02.759
Please.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.679
I need you to take back whatever
you said about your friend Toby.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.879
Withdraw your statement.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.719
I can't.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.839
Look, I don't want to swap details,
all right?

25:12.960 --> 25:14.639
- Just take this.
- Are you sure?

25:14.760 --> 25:16.839
Look at me. Look at this face.
Do I look sure?

25:21.800 --> 25:26.039
I found you and it took me ten minutes,
and I can find you again, just as easily.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.439
Only, next time, it won't be me
who pays you a visit.

25:28.560 --> 25:32.079
It'll be your friends. And I don't need
to tell you what they'll do to you, do I?

25:32.200 --> 25:33.439
I think you know that.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.239
Andrei, are you in there?

25:40.320 --> 25:41.519
Say yes.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.559
Yes.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.359
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.959
I need you to open the door.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.359
- I can't.
- Why not?

25:54.480 --> 25:57.479
Because I don't like women
to look at me when I'm on the lavatory!

25:59.240 --> 26:02.559
- I need to come in.
- Please don't!

26:03.720 --> 26:04.719
All right.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.439
Right, just hurry up.

26:10.760 --> 26:12.399
What are you - sick?

26:12.520 --> 26:14.439
You like to watch men do this?

26:19.720 --> 26:23.519
- Where is he?
- Erm...on the toilet.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.199
I wish to amend my statement.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.839
How do I make that happen
as soon as possible?

26:51.960 --> 26:54.599
Oh, shit! Bastards!

27:14.840 --> 27:16.479
There you go.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.199
There.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.239
All right.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.759
Look, erm...I've gotta go.
Heavy day.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.279
Can you just drive her around
until I can confirm this has blown over?

27:37.400 --> 27:38.479
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

27:38.600 --> 27:39.679
You OK?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.239
Yeah.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.919
- You?
- I...I'm OK, yeah.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.679
What exactly did he do?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.759
I don't wanna know. Come on.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.279
Ronald Bryson.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.799
You sold forged documents to this man.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.919
Cameron Pell.

28:33.320 --> 28:39.479
Your full bespoke service, driving
licence, birth certificate, passport.

28:39.600 --> 28:43.439
Education and employment records,
fake referees.

28:43.560 --> 28:49.239
Everything he needed
to start life with a new identity.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.959
- How are we doing?
- Boss has got his game face on.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.559
Look at him - he's got a face on
like Wayne Rooney's smacked arse.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.479
- You going in, taking over?
- No.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.679
I've been on the other side
of that desk with Schenk.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.119
- He knows what he's doing.
- Yeah, but this is different.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.999
A policeman is missing.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.079
Think he's still got the juice
for this sort of thing?

29:17.200 --> 29:18.319
Yep.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.079
I understand you like to play cards?

29:22.640 --> 29:23.679
Every so often.

29:25.120 --> 29:27.199
- Have much luck?
- My share.

29:29.880 --> 29:35.439
Because I think I should tell you,
your poker face needs some work.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.799
There's a tell.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.719
There.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.199
Corner of your mouth. Oops.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.399
There it goes again.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.999
Did you see that, DS Gray?

29:49.120 --> 29:51.079
I did, guv.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.039
Couldn't miss it, really.

29:53.160 --> 29:57.679
Intriguing, isn't it?
How our faces betray us.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.999
I'll show you later, if you like, Ronald.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.719
It's all up there...

30:06.760 --> 30:11.279
...on Britain's Funniest Police Videos.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.839
I know men like you,
the way you know men like me.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.359
And I know you wouldn't have done this

30:18.480 --> 30:23.839
if you believed there was the least chance
of it coming back on you.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.199
Well, guess what?

30:26.320 --> 30:31.239
It's come back on you
like the hand of God!

30:32.640 --> 30:37.239
And the next words from your mouth
will determine the weight and velocity

30:37.360 --> 30:44.399
of the staggering tonnage of shit
that's about to plummet onto your head.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.679
It weren't just bank accounts
and driving licences he was after.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.719
He wanted to buy a bus.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.239
What are you planning, Cameron?

31:10.280 --> 31:13.039
It's too late for them to stop you now.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.559
God knows I can't stop yous.

31:15.680 --> 31:19.559
So...
So, please, just tell me what it is.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.879
Do you really want to know?

31:34.960 --> 31:35.959
Yeah.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.559
- Really?
- Yes.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.079
OK.

31:51.720 --> 31:54.199
I'm dying to talk about it.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.799
Panic and you suffocate.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.839
Good work, boss.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.079
How did the lead pan out?

32:32.200 --> 32:33.199
It didn't.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.479
Right. We followed the money.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.399
Cameron's using a contact of Bryson's

32:39.520 --> 32:42.319
as a kind of one-man
front organisation and supplier.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.439
We're talking one car,
one Commer-style van,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.999
huge amounts of sodium hydroxide

32:48.120 --> 32:49.919
and a second-hand bus.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.199
Go on.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.919
He's making a bomb.

32:54.040 --> 32:58.039
Quick paint job. Stick a sign on the
front that says, "Sorry, not in service."

32:58.160 --> 33:00.479
Drive wherever you like. Ka-boom.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.599
No.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.599
No?

33:05.840 --> 33:06.839
Seriously?

33:07.880 --> 33:11.799
You don't think this makes sense?
We know he's planning his spectacular.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.639
He's got a large vehicle,
loads of explosives...

33:13.760 --> 33:19.999
No, a bomb's...loud, it's about sound.
It's about fury.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.399
Cameron is the opposite of a bomb
right now.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.239
He's about silence, emptiness and absence.

33:26.360 --> 33:29.639
If he's not making a bomb, why does
he need 3,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide?

33:29.760 --> 33:33.039
The opposite of an explosion
is an implosion.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.679
Black hole.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.599
- 3,000 gallons is enough...
- A black hole consumes matter

33:40.720 --> 33:42.799
and crushes it beyond existence.

33:42.920 --> 33:48.439
When I first heard that, I thought...
that's evil at its most pure, isn't it?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.079
Something that drags you in
and crushes you to nothing.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.599
Maybe he wants to use that material
to dispose...

33:59.960 --> 34:01.519
...dispose of bodies.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.439
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.958
What do we fear the most?

34:11.440 --> 34:12.679
The unknown.

34:15.280 --> 34:20.599
The loss of a loved one.
Who do we love the most?

34:22.280 --> 34:26.079
Who do we protect? Who do we shield
from all the evils of the world?

34:26.199 --> 34:31.998
Who do we...lie to,
leave them terrified in the dark?

34:35.400 --> 34:38.119
Who do we tell that there is
no such thing as the bogeyman?

34:38.239 --> 34:39.478
I think that...

34:42.159 --> 34:44.599
...Cameron is going after the children.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.239
Ah. Ah.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.239
Scheduled school bus to
Owleigh High School was vandalised.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.519
Tyres were slashed.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.839
- By the time the replacement bus...
- Map that. How many did he take?

35:41.960 --> 35:44.399
- We don't know till we double-check.
- Guess. How many?

35:44.520 --> 35:46.359
- 14?
- Benny, get that on the map.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.079
Boss, if I was presumptuous,
overstepped the mark, I'm really sorry.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.479
Don't be. You did good work.
We wouldn't be here without you.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.479
Ah, ah.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.799
This is where he picks them up.

36:08.920 --> 36:14.119
The bus stop, so this is his territory.
How far can he get in, what, half an hour?

36:31.760 --> 36:32.759
Argh!

36:51.880 --> 36:53.439
Excuse me.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.399
I need every policeman,
every armed response,

36:55.520 --> 36:58.159
every helicopter,
PCSO in that area looking for that van.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.679
Get on it!

37:00.680 --> 37:02.239
- Hello.
- Boss.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.519
- Justin.
- I'm on the corner of Wise Avenue,

37:04.640 --> 37:06.079
near Chaffer's Dock.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.519
Cameron's car's still here.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.239
I'm on my way. I'm on my way.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.479
I told you.
I told you he could look after himself.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.639
He was well taught.
Gray and I will track down the bus.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.639
- You get straight to Ripley.
- All right.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.799
- DS Gray.
- Yes, boss!

38:14.200 --> 38:15.199
Mate!

38:23.920 --> 38:25.319
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.719
Boss?

38:29.840 --> 38:34.399
We found the bus abandoned.
Eyewitness claims Cameron Pell

38:34.520 --> 38:36.519
transferred the children
to a second vehicle.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.719
- What other vehicle? What?
- Green VW van.

38:41.840 --> 38:45.439
D reg, possibly,
although that's not been confirmed.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.759
All right, all right, I'll call you back.

38:47.880 --> 38:50.559
We've lost Pell and the kids.
We gotta find out where they are. Car?

38:50.680 --> 38:52.319
It's this way.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.799
Checking this sat nav will give us
a record of his movements.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.599
He's a bogeyman, isn't he? He's a...

39:10.720 --> 39:12.959
He's a monster,
so he does what monsters do,

39:13.080 --> 39:16.799
and that's spirit children away
in the middle of broad daylight.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.519
But how do you make a bus
full of kids just disappear?

39:19.640 --> 39:24.319
Body disposal's not easy, is it?
One body's hard enough. But 10 or 12?

39:24.440 --> 39:28.079
He needs somewhere with a lot of space.
Privacy. Come and go at will.

39:29.320 --> 39:33.119
What's this? This vehicle's been
to a Green Valley Industrial Park

39:33.240 --> 39:36.399
- eight times in the last month.
- That's it. Come on, that's it.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.599
Suspect location believed
to be Green Valley Industrial Park.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.919
It's on the old Stonewater Price dockside.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.959
Come on, come on.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.199
Move!

41:41.160 --> 41:42.879
Tim, don't go out there.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.559
Help!

42:44.920 --> 42:46.999
Come on!

43:06.480 --> 43:07.359
No!

43:09.360 --> 43:11.359
Don't let him see you.
Here we go!

43:14.360 --> 43:16.919
Hey. Hey! Don't you move!

43:17.040 --> 43:19.879
One more step and, I swear,
I will spill his guts all over the floor.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.839
- What's your name?
- What?

43:21.960 --> 43:23.479
- What's your name?
- You know my name.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.319
I'm not talking to you.
Eh, what's your name?

43:27.360 --> 43:28.839
- Eh?
- Don't you speak to him.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.119
- My name's Tim.
- Hey!

43:33.240 --> 43:35.279
- Are you listening to me?
- Tim.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.679
- Is anybody listening to me?!
- That's my favourite name.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.839
- He's not going to hurt you, Tim.
- Yes, he is.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.359
- See? I'm gonna slit his little throat.
- Do you know why?

43:43.480 --> 43:44.719
Why? Because I've done it before.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.879
Because, if he does hurt you,
I'm free to come over there and kill him.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.279
Cos he's nothing, all right?
He's nothing.

43:51.400 --> 43:55.279
- He's just a weak little pathetic man.
- No, he's not.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.479
- Aren't you?
- No, he's not.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.399
- Too weak to hurt anyone...
- No, he's not!

43:58.520 --> 43:59.519
...without wearing this!

44:01.120 --> 44:03.119
Ain't that right, Cameron?

44:08.160 --> 44:09.999
I swear, I swear I'm gonna do it.

44:11.680 --> 44:12.839
Don't go near the van.

44:12.960 --> 44:16.359
Don't you go near the van!
Don't you touch the van!

44:16.480 --> 44:17.399
Come on.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.559
Look, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna...

44:21.880 --> 44:24.359
There you go. Come on. There you go.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.119
Come on, eh?

44:27.240 --> 44:31.359
- Let's get you out of here, eh?
- You know what I can do!

44:31.480 --> 44:34.599
You know what I can do!
You know who I am!

44:34.720 --> 44:37.479
Cameron. No-one's listening.

44:39.800 --> 44:40.919
Uh!

44:49.400 --> 44:50.319
You?

44:50.440 --> 44:53.439
No, it's all you.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.919
Cameron Pell, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.719
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

45:02.840 --> 45:06.799
if you fail to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.839
So...

45:30.080 --> 45:31.239
...am I in trouble?

45:32.840 --> 45:36.959
For what? Saving schoolchildren?
I hardly think so.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.199
If I had my way, you'd be given a medal.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.319
You did outstanding work.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.959
So did you.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.839
I like the thing about
the micro-expression.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.679
Corner of the mouth.
Was that a lie?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.519
Same lie I've been telling since 1986.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.119
Never fails.

46:00.160 --> 46:05.679
Er...Green Valley is registered
at Company House, but it's a shell.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.119
Pell leased it from a contact of Bryson.

46:08.240 --> 46:09.239
Boss!

46:26.760 --> 46:30.159
One body per drum.
Four drums per pallet.

46:31.640 --> 46:34.159
All to be shipped to India
for disposal.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.559
Paperwork's already done.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.399
Those children would've been wiped off
the face of the earth.

47:27.920 --> 47:31.639
- Have you got stuff?
- What? Like belongings?

47:31.760 --> 47:33.439
Yes, like belongings.

47:33.560 --> 47:36.719
- Clothes and things.
- Not much, just this.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.599
Er...have you got a minute?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.959
Yes, of course. Come in.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.519
I can't believe what you did!

47:50.640 --> 47:54.759
You're my daughter. You wouldn't be
where you were if it wasn't for him.

47:54.880 --> 47:57.879
- You don't understand.
- I understand I got my daughter back.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.679
I'm not staying here,
not after what you did!

47:59.800 --> 48:01.879
- You'll do what you're told.
- You can't make me!

48:02.000 --> 48:06.079
No? And where you gonna go?
Back where you came from?

48:06.200 --> 48:09.319
You've got no money.
No friends. No life.

48:09.440 --> 48:13.879
- So, if not here, where? The gutter?
- Caroline... Listen.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.759
- You listening? I need you to hear this.
- Go on.

48:17.880 --> 48:21.599
These people don't want to hurt me.
They need me in one piece.

48:21.720 --> 48:25.799
I've got nothing to leverage.
No kids. No family. No wife.

48:25.920 --> 48:30.559
But they know I'll do what I have to,
cos I proved that to them today.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.919
It's me, Mum.

48:32.040 --> 48:35.919
If he doesn't keep on doing
what they tell him, they'll hurt me.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.959
Listen to your daughter, all right?

48:38.080 --> 48:42.919
Cos you put her in this situation
after you sold me out. So listen to her.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.039
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Leave!

48:47.160 --> 48:49.319
I've got a job. A career. A life.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.239
Your safety is not my concern!
But do the right thing.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.519
Give Jenny some money.
Set her up in a new city.

48:55.640 --> 48:57.319
She stays here with me.

48:58.320 --> 49:02.719
You won't let them hurt her.
You'll do whatever they tell you to do.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.079
You made that quite plain.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.679
- No.
- What?!

49:05.800 --> 49:08.119
Caroline, I'm not on their hook,

49:08.240 --> 49:11.519
and I'm not gonna be a copper any more.
I'm leaving.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.919
And when these people find out,
they're gonna come back

49:14.040 --> 49:16.439
and they're gonna hurt you both.
Do you understand that?

49:16.560 --> 49:19.319
You can stop them.

49:19.440 --> 49:23.239
- Arrest them.
- No, I can't.

49:23.360 --> 49:28.759
- I'm over a barrel. They sent me this.
- Andrei Kolchak. One of our licensees.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.759
- See that?
- I can't do it overnight. It needs time.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.359
- You made sure of that, didn't you?
- It has to be done today.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.559
- You made sure of that, didn't you?
- It has to be done today.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.239
- And if I do help?
- The slate's clear.

49:38.360 --> 49:43.119
Look, Jenny, you're safe here tonight.
But tomorrow, you gotta get away.

49:43.240 --> 49:47.599
You've gotta get far away. And do yourself
a favour, stay away from this woman.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.519
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.

49:49.640 --> 49:52.599
- Go anywhere.
- Please, don't just leave me!

49:54.080 --> 49:55.679
John, I'm begging you!

49:59.840 --> 50:02.639
No, sorry. I've done enough.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.319
Good luck.

50:54.360 --> 50:55.399
Hmm.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.759
Busy day?

50:58.880 --> 51:00.679
Like you wouldn't believe.

51:02.880 --> 51:03.799
You?

51:03.920 --> 51:05.959
You know what it's like.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.359
Always on the go.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.959
So I see you escaped.

51:11.080 --> 51:13.239
Like a princess from her tower.

51:14.920 --> 51:15.959
What's this?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.879
It's my dad's gun.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.999
You don't like guns.

51:21.120 --> 51:24.879
- No, I don't.
- And there's only one bullet.

51:27.040 --> 51:31.519
- What have you been playing at?
- Put it down. That's just not funny.

51:35.760 --> 51:36.759
Alice...

51:38.480 --> 51:40.559
...you shouldn't have come here.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.199
- They'll find you.
- Well, they can try.

51:44.240 --> 51:49.319
But they're Wile E Coyote
and I'm the Roadrunner.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.559
Meep-meep.

51:50.680 --> 51:54.519
- Where will you go?
- I thought I'd start with Mexico.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.839
Then there's Marrakech.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.639
Monte Carlo.

51:59.760 --> 52:02.639
Ah, and that's just some of the Ms.

52:02.760 --> 52:06.239
There's an entire alphabet
to work through.

52:08.920 --> 52:11.239
Come with me.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.079
I can't.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.199
Why not?

52:16.400 --> 52:18.799
Because I am who I am.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.479
And you are who you are.

52:24.560 --> 52:27.999
Which is exactly why I'm asking.

52:28.120 --> 52:31.359
- We'd have so much fun.
- That's what I'm scared of.

52:31.480 --> 52:37.079
Come on. Yin and Yang.
Bonnie and Clyde. Bert and Ernie.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.959
Alice...

52:40.600 --> 52:41.839
...you have to leave.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.479
OK?

52:43.600 --> 52:45.799
You have to leave.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.879
They'll come here, you know.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.039
Why?

52:49.160 --> 52:51.759
Cos they're scared you'll try to kill me.

52:53.200 --> 52:56.799
Which is the funny thing, because it's
not me who'll end up killing you, is it?

52:56.920 --> 52:58.359
It's them.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.799
You know that.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.039
You've done enough.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.599
Now give it up...

53:12.600 --> 53:13.919
...and walk away.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.119
Come with me.

53:18.160 --> 53:22.839
I know you want to.
You've got a telltale heart.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.959
We can swim with the sharks.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.399
See the Nazca Lines.

53:30.680 --> 53:34.959
Have you ever eaten fugu
made from puffer fish?

53:35.080 --> 53:38.439
It's fatal if prepared incorrectly
and, er...

53:39.440 --> 53:41.239
...delicious, naturally.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.039
I just can't.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.439
Who is she?

53:51.120 --> 53:53.959
- It's not like that.
- I know.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.679
If it were, I may be able to understand.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.639
You do understand.
That's the thing about you.

53:57.760 --> 54:00.719
Just because I understand,
it doesn't mean I approve.

54:00.840 --> 54:03.039
- It works both ways, doesn't it?
- Doesn't it just?

54:04.400 --> 54:05.999
And didn't it always?

55:19.720 --> 55:20.879
Come on.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.079
Come on.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.479
John!

55:39.440 --> 55:41.679
All right, then. Erm...

55:41.800 --> 55:44.239
Living room. Kitchen, bathroom.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.439
My room.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.039
Your room.

55:51.200 --> 55:55.479
Um, tomorrow, I'll get you a bed,
but tonight, you're on the sofa.

55:59.520 --> 56:04.759
Erm, just make yourself at home,
you know, you can, er, put the kettle on.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.959
- Want one?
- Tea.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.279
This kettle's minging.

56:15.320 --> 56:18.079
It's got miningitus.
D'you get it from a market?

56:22.280 --> 56:26.159
You can get righteous kettles these days,
all chrome and whatnot.

56:26.280 --> 56:28.079
Where's he keep the mugs?
