00:03.003 --> 00:04.796
[Violet] <i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Light As A Feather...

00:04.796 --> 00:06.340
The game, it gets passed on

00:06.340 --> 00:08.008
from one person to the next
like a curse.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
<i>Five people play,</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.136
<i>only one survives</i>
<i>to play again.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:12.721
‐Aah!
‐Aah!

00:12.721 --> 00:14.473
Damn it, why can't I read you?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.517
‐[laughing]
‐Jennie.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.061
‐What do you want?
‐We have to play
Light as a Feather again.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.854
If we knew how
she's supposed to die,

00:20.854 --> 00:22.981
we'd have something on her.
We could get her to talk.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Lena said she watched them
play Light as a Feather.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.194
[Henry] <i>Then Lena heard</i>
<i>how Violet's supposed to die.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:28.695
[whispering] Violet Simmons...

00:30.322 --> 00:32.241
Did you save anything
from the journal?

00:32.241 --> 00:33.367
[Trey] Check this out.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.785
I don't trust you,

00:34.785 --> 00:36.245
but if there is one thing

00:36.245 --> 00:38.247
that you, me, and Alex
have in common

00:38.247 --> 00:40.165
it's that none of us
want to die.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.416
What do we do now?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.960
We're gonna help each other.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.298
[Violet]
So what's your plan?

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
You gonna tie me up again?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.510
[McKenna] That depends.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.887
So maybe you could answer
some questions for me now.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.222
I can try.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.684
Am I gonna die?

00:58.684 --> 01:00.394
You mean, like, ever?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.604
[McKenna]
You know what I mean.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.773
I was the only one that night
who played the game

01:04.773 --> 01:06.066
whose death wasn't predicted.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.359
So what does that mean?

01:07.359 --> 01:09.027
Am I safe?

01:09.027 --> 01:11.113
No, it‐‐

01:11.113 --> 01:13.699
It just means
that I didn't see it.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.578
There's still a timer on you,
like me and Alex.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.081
The only difference is, I know
how we're supposed to die.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
So that's why you wanted to play
the game with me again.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.003
You wanted to see my death.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.089
Yeah.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.301
And I actually did try again
the night that you stayed over.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.595
‐When I was asleep?
‐Obviously, it didn't work,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.848
and every time I tried,
she was there, protecting you.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.684
She? What do you mean, she?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.438
Oh, my God.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.402
Jennie. She's been trying to‐‐
to tell me something.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.279
What?

01:52.279 --> 01:53.905
Trey read something
from the journal

01:53.905 --> 01:56.408
that's starting to make
a lot more sense now.

01:56.408 --> 01:59.328
What part? I've gone over that
thing, like, a thousand times.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.290
It says, "This game
came from darkness,

02:03.290 --> 02:04.791
so maybe..."

02:04.791 --> 02:06.960
"It can go back there someday."

02:06.960 --> 02:10.839
Darkness‐‐ that‐‐
that must mean death.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.301
So maybe this curse
is from some other world,

02:14.301 --> 02:16.928
and it's‐‐ it's, like,
feeding off of our souls,

02:16.928 --> 02:20.015
and Jennie's
trying to help us lift it.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.560
You can't possibly know that.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.270
You're right.

02:27.439 --> 02:30.150
But I think I know a way
we can find out.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.111
What are you saying?

02:33.111 --> 02:36.948
Looks like you're gonna get
your wish after all, Violet.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.579
We're gonna play
Light as a Feather again.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.542
[theme music playing]

02:56.551 --> 02:58.595
Are you kidding? This is exactly
what Violet wants.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.639
Trey's right.
We can't trust her.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.307
We have to give it a shot.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.850
Jennie's been trying
to reach me

03:03.850 --> 03:05.769
ever since we played the game
that night.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.689
Recreating it is
the best way I can
think of to contact her.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.232
[Alex] No, you don't
even know if it's gonna work.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.733
[McKenna]
Yeah, you're right, I don't,

03:11.733 --> 03:13.652
but have you guys
thought of a better idea?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.237
We can't call the cops.
The journal's gone.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.738
Thanks to Henry.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.949
Has anybody heard from him,
by the way?

03:18.949 --> 03:20.992
No.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.120
I mean, I figured he'd call
once he was done at the Regans'.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.540
‐Guys?
‐What?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.291
Henry has Violet's prediction.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.213
<i>Hey, this is Henry.</i>
<i>You know the drill.</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:34.381
<i>[beep]</i>

03:34.381 --> 03:36.466
Hey. Um, it's me.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.510
Just call me back.
What happened?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.643
Someone needs to go find him.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.272
I haven't driven
since the accident.

03:50.272 --> 03:54.234
Yeah, well, now might be
a good time to start.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.653
No. I'm not gonna
leave you guys alone
with that lunatic.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.697
No, we're not alone
if it's the two of us.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.991
Look, I really need you
to do this.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.910
And even if you stay,
you know you can't be
a part of this game.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.745
Fine,

04:05.745 --> 04:07.330
but you have to let me know
what's going on.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.124
You have to keep
in contact, okay?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.876
Okay, I promise.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.336
Now go find Henry.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.842
Hey, stop looking so worried.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.428
We're gonna beat this, okay?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.181
I hope you're right.

04:24.181 --> 04:29.019
I am, especially now
that I have extra motivation.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.395
Yeah, what's that?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.279
You really have to ask?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.531
Go.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.548
I'll probably regret
asking this question,

04:58.548 --> 05:00.801
but where are we going?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.219
Violet has an idea.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.678
Oh, great.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.972
Okay, if we're gonna
play again,

05:05.972 --> 05:07.265
we need to make sure
that we match the original

05:07.265 --> 05:09.142
as close as possible.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.102
And since we don't have‐‐

05:11.102 --> 05:12.896
Don't say their names.

05:12.896 --> 05:17.651
Okay, but we need something
of them represented,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.528
like a personal item.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.904
Like‐‐ like a purse

05:20.904 --> 05:22.781
or a piece of clothing.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.574
Great, let's just show up
at the Richmonds' and say,

05:24.574 --> 05:27.911
"Hey, you mind if we raid
your dead kid's closet?"

05:27.911 --> 05:30.539
Actually, I still
have Livvy's bracelet.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.084
We just need
something of Candace's.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.379
You have any ideas?

05:37.379 --> 05:39.464
Fine.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.217
Ms. Preston's been staying with
her sister since Candace died,

05:42.217 --> 05:45.011
but I know
where they hide their key.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.056
Great.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.766
We'll go there.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.977
[Alex] I swear,
this shit better work.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.086
<i>‐Hey. This is Henry.</i>
<i>You know the drill.</i>
<i>‐[beep]</i>

06:18.086 --> 06:19.504
Richmond, it's Trey.
I'm outside the Regans'.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.839
Where are you?

06:27.053 --> 06:28.513
[cell phone ringing]

06:30.599 --> 06:32.642
[ringing]

06:39.816 --> 06:41.234

06:51.453 --> 06:53.496

06:53.496 --> 06:56.499
[swing creaking]

07:06.843 --> 07:08.637
[Alex softly] Candace.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.880
[laughs quietly]

08:20.083 --> 08:23.253
Her election speech.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.093
[Violet]
She's still not responding?

08:30.093 --> 08:32.887
Will you let me know
if anything changes?

08:32.887 --> 08:36.057
Okay, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.727
Your grandma?

08:40.395 --> 08:41.563
What happened?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.523
She's in a coma.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.986
She's gonna die.
I can feel it.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.783
I'm not asking for your pity.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.829
Yeah, that's probably
a good instinct.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.039
But you have to understand,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.832
I was forced into this, too,

09:00.832 --> 09:04.252
and it never ends‐‐

09:04.252 --> 09:05.879
the pressure,
the constant fear

09:05.879 --> 09:07.672
that people I love
are going to die,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.176
and this thing on my back,

09:11.176 --> 09:14.220
growing and rotting me
from the inside.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.808
I'm not a bad person,
really.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.769
I just didn't have a choice.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.522
[door closes, footsteps]

09:27.984 --> 09:30.236
Okay, let's do this
before I change my mind.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.956
<i>Hey, it's Mack.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

09:41.956 --> 09:44.292
<i>‐[beep]</i>
‐Where the hell are you?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.669
I called you three times.
I'm still at the Regans'.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.297
I think something really bad
might have happened to Henry.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.715
Just call me back.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.471
[bell tolling]

09:56.471 --> 09:58.306
[Alex] This place still
gives me the creeps.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.934
[Violet]
You guys have been here before?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.852
[Alex]
Yeah, it was a while ago.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.938
Believe me, I don't want
to be here, either.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.606
But if my hunch is right...

10:08.108 --> 10:10.318
this is exactly
where we should be.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.653
No, I'm sorry,
I can't do this.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.530
[McKenna] Hey, Alex,
stop, stop. Please.

10:15.073 --> 10:19.077
Listen, we both lost
Jennie that night.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.455
And I know
that you loved her so much.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.708
But it wasn't anyone's fault.
It just...

10:25.708 --> 10:27.377
It just happened.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.463
But she's with us now,

10:30.463 --> 10:34.175
and she wants to make sure
that we stay alive.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.427
How is she gonna do that?

10:44.519 --> 10:46.354
She's gonna play with us.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.121
[Violet] Are you ready?

11:03.121 --> 11:06.541
Yeah, just start it
like you did last time.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.210
"McKenna Brady was a girl."

11:12.088 --> 11:14.090
McKenna Brady was a girl...

11:21.723 --> 11:23.516
Mrs. Brady.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.560
Hi, Trey. You haven't
spoken to McKenna, have you?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.896
She said she was gonna sleep
over at Alex's last night,

11:27.896 --> 11:29.939
‐but then she didn't‐‐
‐I think she's in trouble.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.191
Oh, my God.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.859
What's going on? Where is she?

11:32.859 --> 11:34.652
I don't know,
but that's why I need your help.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.571
You can still track
her phone, right?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.077
Say I shared everything
with my sister.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.039
Say it.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.876
McKenna and Jennie Brady
shared everything.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.794
<i>[girls laughing]</i>

11:51.794 --> 11:52.879
A birthday...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.047
[horns tooting]

11:54.047 --> 11:56.633
a face, and even a soul.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.969
They also shared a heart defect,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.263
a condition that claimed
one sister's life

12:02.263 --> 12:04.474
and left the other behind.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.434
McKenna tried to get over
the tragedy,

12:06.434 --> 12:09.229
but something
was holding her back.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.189
And then...

12:11.189 --> 12:13.274
And then...

12:13.274 --> 12:14.609

McKenna Brady could no longer
live without her sister, Jennie.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.385
Hey, you're almost there.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.928
It's okay.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.807
And then what?

14:09.807 --> 14:11.976
With her soul
on the other side,

14:11.976 --> 14:13.770
soon McKenna's body
would cease to function.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.605
Wait! What are you doing?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.982
Normally, a comatose body
could take years to shut down,

14:17.982 --> 14:19.358
but because
of McKenna's faulty heart,

14:19.358 --> 14:20.860
she only had minutes.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.445
Stop saying that!
You're gonna kill her!

14:22.445 --> 14:25.114
[McKenna]
I have a life here.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.659
but I'm just so tired of feeling
like half of me is gone.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.161
No.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.998
And then there
was only one thing left to do,

14:33.998 --> 14:35.958
to put her body
out of its misery,

14:35.958 --> 14:37.293
‐snuff it out.
‐[Alex] What?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.836
‐To finally draw...
‐Stop! Don't!

14:38.836 --> 14:40.588
that last bit of oxygen
from her lungs.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.048
‐No!
‐Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.966
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.343
‐Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.
‐McKenna, please!

14:45.343 --> 14:46.844
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.513
Light as a feather, stiff
as a board.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.931
Light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

14:49.931 --> 14:50.973
It's almost gone.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.476
[Alex] <i>McKenna, wake up!</i>

14:53.476 --> 14:55.103
[Violet] <i>Light as a feather,</i>

15:33.307 --> 15:34.392
[bag zipping]

15:37.228 --> 15:38.354
Sorry, Mack.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.609
What can I say?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.486
Old habits die hard.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.703
Yes, the Willow Falls
Mausoleum on Thurber Road.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.247
Violet Simmons‐‐
she's completely crazy,

15:56.247 --> 15:59.458
and I think she has my friends.
Come now!

15:59.458 --> 16:00.626
‐You still getting a signal?
‐[Alex] Hey! In here!

16:00.626 --> 16:02.128
Yeah, it's still this way.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.130
‐[pounding]
‐[Alex] Help! I'm in here!

16:04.130 --> 16:05.965
‐Let me out!
‐It's Alex!

16:05.965 --> 16:08.467
[Alex] Oh, my God.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.720
‐Are you okay?
‐Yeah, I think.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.513
Wait! Where is McKenna?

16:12.513 --> 16:13.556
I don't know.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.974
[Trey] Over here!

16:17.143 --> 16:18.936
‐I think she's in here!
‐Oh, my God!

16:26.444 --> 16:28.863
[Alex] Oh, my God!

16:28.863 --> 16:30.072
[Alex sobbing]

16:34.702 --> 16:36.370
[Deb]
McKenna's not breathing!

16:36.370 --> 16:37.705
All right, c'mon, McKenna!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.540
No, no, no. Please, no.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.500
‐Three!
‐McKenna, come on!

16:42.877 --> 16:45.880
[gasping]

16:47.632 --> 16:49.258
[Deb] What happened?!

16:49.258 --> 16:50.718
I don't know.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.012
Everything
happened really fast.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
Mom, I saw Jennie.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.140
What?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.975
I saw her. She helped us.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.976
She helped us?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.561
Jennie got the curse.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.271
Permanently? You sure?

17:02.271 --> 17:03.689
[McKenna] Yeah.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.151
Violet can't hurt us anymore.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.819
The game's over.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.740
[Alex]
Where is she, anyway?

17:13.866 --> 17:14.867
[McKenna] I don't know.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.119
[Alex] It's okay.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.382
Stop right there!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.092
Violet Simmons?

17:34.303 --> 17:36.097
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

17:38.224 --> 17:39.809
Are you hurt?

17:41.769 --> 17:42.812
No.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.815
Actually, I'm perfect.

17:51.939 --> 17:52.947
[class bell rings]

17:52.947 --> 17:55.157
‐Oh, hi.
‐Hi!

17:55.157 --> 17:57.618
So? Last exam of the semester.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.495
‐How'd it go?
‐Not bad.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.081
I think I may have actually
bullshitted my way to a B‐minus.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.874
Wow. That's impressive.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.920
Wow, this is
the first winter break

18:07.920 --> 18:10.506
without Candace or Livvy.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.175
Feels kind of weird.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.470
Yeah. Right now,
Candace should be

18:16.470 --> 18:18.431
complaining
about college essays,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.225
and Olivia should
be packing for Aspen.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.352
Yep.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.146
It's gonna get better, right?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.565
Yeah, I think so.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.152
It's gonna take some time.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.862
You know,
I know it sounds crazy,

18:32.862 --> 18:35.239
but I feel like
they're together somehow,

18:35.239 --> 18:37.658
helping us.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.368
‐Right?
‐Yeah.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.246
Hi.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.289
Hey.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.628
Two weeks off.
Thank God, right?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.713
‐We still on
for Noreen's tonight?
‐Mm‐hmm.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.548
Isaac might be coming
if he feels up to it.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.051
Yeah, I'm pretty excited
to experience a party

18:55.051 --> 18:56.886
without the aid
of pharmaceuticals.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.679
McKenna?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.351
[Trey]
I just talked to his dad.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.977
Still no word.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.771
There's always hope.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.649
I mean, for all we know,
he could be somewhere out there.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.859
‐Yeah.
‐[Trey] Hopefully.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.194
You guys want a ride?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.029
Yeah. Sounds good.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.907
Um, actually,
I have someplace to be.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.992
Oh. Where are you going?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.787
Nowhere.
I just have to do something.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.958
[buzzer]

19:38.177 --> 19:40.554
[Violet]
Wow, McKenna Brady.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.641
I was surprised
to hear you were coming.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.476
Yeah, well, believe me,
if I had a choice,

19:45.476 --> 19:47.353
I would not be here.

19:47.353 --> 19:51.148
Look, before you say anything,

19:51.148 --> 19:53.317
I just want to thank you
for saving my life.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.610
That wasn't me.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.945
That was Jennie.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.446
I know.
But you were the one‐‐

19:57.446 --> 19:58.656
Where's Henry Richmond?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.827
Well, as you can imagine,

20:02.827 --> 20:04.370
you're not the first person
to ask me that.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.746
Cut the shit.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.999
Honest, I don't know.

20:08.999 --> 20:09.959
Right.

20:11.377 --> 20:16.298
Well, he and Lena Regan
are the only two people

20:16.298 --> 20:17.883
who know your death prediction,

20:17.883 --> 20:19.677
and now they're missing.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.512
I know how it looks.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.432
I don't expect you
to believe me.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.851
Good. I don't.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.771
Goodbye, Violet.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.233
Thanks for stopping by.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.319
Oh, you know what,
there's one more thing.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.114
I've been wondering
what this goes to.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.824
Actually, that's mine.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.326
I'll just hold onto it for you.
