- Yeah.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.863
Yeah.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.632

06:04.898 --> 06:06.632
Yeah.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.168
- Chase, should we suck some

06:06.665 --> 06:09.168
helium out of these balloons?

Oh, baby.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.420

06:16.420 --> 06:18.310
Just remember, keep it simple,

06:16.420 --> 06:18.310
keep it low-key.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.879
[laughter]

06:23.382 --> 06:25.250
- This is good coffee.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.529
- Oh, I could use some.

06:29.288 --> 06:32.459
- Suzie, I'm so happy

06:29.288 --> 06:32.459
that you came by to see me.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.562
- I haven't been to really

06:32.492 --> 06:35.562
a fancy place like this.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.230
I don't really know

06:35.595 --> 06:37.230
what to order.

06:37.262 --> 06:39.264
- Well, I'm just gonna order

06:37.262 --> 06:39.264
a regular cup of coffee.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.670
It's all I know how.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.136
- I can't believe how long

06:41.100 --> 06:43.136
this line is.

06:43.168 --> 06:44.870
It's crazy!

06:43.168 --> 06:44.870
- I know it.

06:46.605 --> 06:47.774
- [gasps]

06:49.209 --> 06:51.711
He's just cut in line.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.711
- Oh...

06:51.745 --> 06:53.680
- Is there a peppermint coffee?

06:53.713 --> 06:57.516
- Yeah, it's a peppermint

06:53.713 --> 06:57.516
latte or some bull.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.418
[laughter]

07:00.786 --> 07:03.889
- We came before her.

07:00.786 --> 07:03.889
- I know it.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.524
- They got no manners.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.524
- Excuse me, ladies.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.726
- No manners at all.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.228
I don't know

07:07.761 --> 07:09.228
what these people think

07:09.262 --> 07:10.629
they're doing cutting the line.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.831
They probably see

07:10.663 --> 07:12.831
two elderly ladies

07:12.865 --> 07:15.168
and they think

07:12.865 --> 07:15.168
that they can take advantage.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.437
- I can't believe this.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.437
- Yeah, really!

07:17.470 --> 07:19.389
- And they're

07:17.470 --> 07:19.389
just letting them do it.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.406
- I don't know, Nanny.

07:20.439 --> 07:22.175
Maybe they're not doing it

07:20.439 --> 07:22.175
intentionally.

07:22.207 --> 07:23.442
- No, they are.

07:23.475 --> 07:25.845
I read about ageism

07:23.475 --> 07:25.845
in my newspaper,

07:25.879 --> 07:27.747
and it makes me mad as hell.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.850
- [snorts]

07:27.781 --> 07:30.850
I can tell.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.584
- Excuse me.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.584
- Hey, buddy.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.454
Where are you going?

07:34.487 --> 07:35.922
- I'm just going to

07:34.487 --> 07:35.922
pick up my coffee.

07:35.954 --> 07:38.909
- Hey, well, what do you think

07:35.954 --> 07:38.909
we're doing here?

07:39.826 --> 07:41.627
- Man, did you see that?

07:41.661 --> 07:43.663
- They can kiss

07:41.661 --> 07:43.663
this old wrinkled ass,

07:43.697 --> 07:46.990
is what they can do,

07:43.697 --> 07:46.990
and we make our own coffee.

<i>[elegant classical music]</i>

07:54.173 --> 07:56.308
- Oh, my gosh,

07:54.173 --> 07:56.308
I cannot wait to be here

07:56.343 --> 08:00.129
this summer

07:56.343 --> 08:00.129
on my own, with this pool.

08:00.129 --> 08:01.714
- I don't know

08:00.129 --> 08:01.714
what it is about it,

08:01.747 --> 08:04.170
but cleaning this pool

08:01.747 --> 08:04.170
zens me out.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.250
- What?

08:04.170 --> 08:05.250
- Yeah.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.454
It's like I took a Xanax.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.454
You need to try this.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.230
- No, I don't want to try it.

08:10.230 --> 08:11.391
- Hello.

08:11.423 --> 08:13.259
Since when did you

08:11.423 --> 08:13.259
become her pool-boy?

08:13.259 --> 08:15.661
- It's therapeutic.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.661
- You wanna try it?

08:15.694 --> 08:17.430
- If I wanted to try it, I'd

08:15.694 --> 08:17.430
have been cleaning my own pool.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.766
I came to pick up

08:17.463 --> 08:19.766
your mama's anniversary gift

08:19.798 --> 08:21.367
that I bought her

08:19.798 --> 08:21.367
and it's not outside.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.569
Where is it?

08:21.401 --> 08:22.569
- What are you talking about?

08:22.601 --> 08:24.437
There haven't been

08:22.601 --> 08:24.437
any deliveries.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.307
- The car that I had delivered

08:24.471 --> 08:27.307
for your mama.

08:27.339 --> 08:29.274
- There hadn't been

08:27.339 --> 08:29.274
any car delivered.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.843
- The guy sent me

08:29.309 --> 08:30.843
a text message

08:30.877 --> 08:33.746
and told me that he put it

08:30.877 --> 08:33.746
in the driveway.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.216
- That little beater?

08:33.779 --> 08:36.216
- Whose car is that?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.884
- Maybe it's stolen.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.753
- Why would a stolen car

08:37.917 --> 08:39.753
be in our driveway?

08:39.786 --> 08:41.687
- Why would you

08:39.786 --> 08:41.687
get that for Mama?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.559
That's a terrible gift.

08:43.559 --> 08:44.456
- People don't just leave

08:43.559 --> 08:44.456
a random car

08:44.490 --> 08:46.625
in someone's driveway

08:44.490 --> 08:46.625
without notifying them.

08:46.658 --> 08:48.927
- I told you I'm having

08:46.658 --> 08:48.927
something delivered.

08:48.961 --> 08:51.970
- "Something"!

08:48.961 --> 08:51.970
"Something" isn't a car!

08:51.130 --> 08:52.966
- In her defense,

08:51.130 --> 08:52.966
that's a little vague.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.334
- Thank you, Chase.

08:54.366 --> 08:55.534
- Please, I'm not in the mood

08:55.567 --> 08:57.470
because I need

08:55.567 --> 08:57.470
to know where this car is.

08:57.504 --> 09:01.106
- Let's be adults

08:57.504 --> 09:01.106
about this, okay?

09:03.899 --> 09:06.111
It's gone.

09:03.899 --> 09:06.111
- We had it towed.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.681
- Y'all better

09:06.145 --> 09:07.681
not be messing with me.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.450
The car is part of the surprise

09:07.714 --> 09:10.450
for your mother.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.317
It was the car

09:10.482 --> 09:12.317
that your mother had

09:12.351 --> 09:13.519
when she and I started dating.

09:13.552 --> 09:14.788
- Oh, dear God.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.623
- You're gonna remind her

09:14.821 --> 09:16.623
of the painful days?

09:16.655 --> 09:19.525
- Chase, let me tell you

09:16.655 --> 09:19.525
something, son.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.827
You was conceived

09:19.558 --> 09:21.827
in the back of that car.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.328
- Ugh!

09:23.363 --> 09:24.596
- I was conceived

09:23.363 --> 09:24.596
in the back of that car?

09:24.630 --> 09:28.500
- Yeah--not in that car,

09:24.630 --> 09:28.500
but one exactly like it.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.537
At the time--

09:30.570 --> 09:31.804
I'm not getting into this.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.389
- How are we supposed to know

09:31.837 --> 09:33.389
if something

09:33.730 --> 09:35.642
like that belonged to you?

09:35.674 --> 09:37.644
- I ask very little

09:35.674 --> 09:37.644
of my children,

09:37.677 --> 09:41.147
but Chase and Savannah

09:37.677 --> 09:41.147
consistently let me down

09:41.181 --> 09:43.649
every time I ask them

09:41.181 --> 09:43.649
to help me out with something.

09:43.682 --> 09:45.384
- Oh, Lord,

09:43.682 --> 09:45.384
what did they do now?

09:45.418 --> 09:46.885
- Well, I actually

09:45.418 --> 09:46.885
can't tell you

09:46.919 --> 09:48.788
because it has something to do

09:46.919 --> 09:48.788
with our anniversary.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.570
- Chase and Savannah are doing

09:48.822 --> 09:51.570
something for our anniversary?

09:51.570 --> 09:53.726
- It doesn't matter--just

09:51.570 --> 09:53.726
forget I even said anything.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.960
- Todd, I told you simple.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.465
- It's gonna be simple now,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.465
that's for sure.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.234
Y'all better go and get my car

10:01.267 --> 10:02.634
and get it

10:01.267 --> 10:02.634
brought back to this house.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.803
- I wouldn't even know

10:02.668 --> 10:04.803
how to drive a car like that.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.740
- You knew how to get it towed.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.308
- How much'd you get that thing

10:06.773 --> 10:09.308
for, like 100 bucks?

10:09.341 --> 10:10.909
- I think we did you a favor.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.129
- You should have left it

10:10.943 --> 10:13.129
in the '80s or the '70s,

10:13.460 --> 10:14.647
wherever the hell

10:13.460 --> 10:14.647
that thing came from.

I mean, you have a voice

We should stand up

- Hello.

12:07.826 --> 12:09.261
- How are you?

12:07.826 --> 12:09.261
- Good. Thank you.

12:09.294 --> 12:11.230
May I help you?

12:09.294 --> 12:11.230
- Yes.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.801
My daughter had

12:11.264 --> 12:14.801
a car towed here by accident,

12:14.833 --> 12:17.269
and I need to find that car

12:17.302 --> 12:18.904
because it should have

12:17.302 --> 12:18.904
never been brought in.

12:18.937 --> 12:22.307
- What kind of car was it?

12:18.937 --> 12:22.307
- It's this car here.

12:22.341 --> 12:23.409
- Okay.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.278
- So have you seen

12:23.442 --> 12:25.278
that car today?

12:25.311 --> 12:27.514
- No, we bring

12:25.311 --> 12:27.514
a lot of cars here.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.215
- Uh-huh.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.215
- I haven't processed

12:29.249 --> 12:30.616

12:30.649 --> 12:33.860

12:30.649 --> 12:33.860

12:33.860 --> 12:35.187
- Okay, thank you.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.187
- Just watch out for snakes.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.909
- Okay...

12:36.523 --> 12:38.909
- Go--you first.

12:38.909 --> 12:40.293
- I'm not going first!

12:38.909 --> 12:40.293
He said snakes.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.629
- I technically wasn't

12:40.326 --> 12:42.629
even involved in this.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.897
- No, you was there.

12:42.662 --> 12:43.897
- Yes, you were.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.365
Come on.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.365
- I don't--I don't--

12:45.398 --> 12:46.499
I seriously don't mess

12:45.398 --> 12:46.499
with snakes.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.966
- No, don't worry

12:46.533 --> 12:47.966
about the snakes.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.134
You worry about whether or not

12:49.168 --> 12:50.669
they've started

12:49.168 --> 12:50.669
taking my car apart.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.938
- This is like finding like

12:50.703 --> 12:52.938
a needle in a haystack.

12:52.971 --> 12:55.107
- You know,

12:52.971 --> 12:55.107
as if this anniversary surprise

12:55.107 --> 12:56.643
was not difficult enough

12:55.107 --> 12:56.643
as it is already--

12:56.676 --> 12:58.177
- Hold up!

12:58.211 --> 13:00.460
You said anniversary surprise.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.480
That sounds like something big.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.351
- It's not.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.351
It's low, low, low-key.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.820
- Okay.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.820
- Let's just put it this way.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.654
When your children

13:06.852 --> 13:08.654
get involved,

13:08.687 --> 13:10.322
it don't go no lower than that.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.322
- Oh.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.580
- Oh, there's a black car.

13:12.580 --> 13:13.259
- That's not it, Savannah.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.730
- Savannah, there's

13:13.293 --> 13:16.730
100 black cars out here.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.659
- Oh, God, do you see it?

13:20.659 --> 13:21.967
- Not yet.

13:22.679 --> 13:23.836
Where the hell are we?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.705
- A place that

13:23.870 --> 13:25.705
I shouldn't even be in.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.807
Do y'all have any idea

13:25.739 --> 13:27.807
how much energy

13:27.841 --> 13:29.975
that I put into making

13:27.841 --> 13:29.975
this special for your mother?

13:30.759 --> 13:32.345
- Obviously not too much.

13:30.759 --> 13:32.345
- Again, you don't understand

13:32.379 --> 13:34.647
the significance of this car.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.582
- So what do you

13:34.681 --> 13:36.582
actually have planned?

13:36.615 --> 13:38.418
- Like I would tell y'all.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.860
- Well, it better not be

13:38.451 --> 13:40.860
anything big

13:40.860 --> 13:41.855
'cause she said

13:40.860 --> 13:41.855
she wanted a simple dinner.

13:41.888 --> 13:42.956
- Simple.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.923
- After 27 years

13:42.989 --> 13:44.923
of being with your mama,

13:44.957 --> 13:46.259
I know her better than you do.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.950
- Well, I don't see anything

13:46.292 --> 13:49.950
but cars everywhere.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.970
- Come on, y'all,

13:49.950 --> 13:51.970
let's try to find this.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.899
- So I can come down now?

13:55.601 --> 13:57.636
- Ooh, y'all,

13:55.601 --> 13:57.636
my ankles are itching.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.243
So they don't mow junkyards?

14:03.275 --> 14:04.744
- Does it look

14:03.275 --> 14:04.744
like they mow it?

14:04.778 --> 14:06.578
- Well, they should.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.349
Where is this car?

14:09.381 --> 14:11.684
- Wait a minute,

14:09.381 --> 14:11.684
there it is.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.820
- Where?

14:11.717 --> 14:13.820
- Right there.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.554
Look at this.

14:15.587 --> 14:17.856
You will be surprised at how

14:15.587 --> 14:17.856
far back that seat reclines.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.458
- Daddy!

14:19.491 --> 14:21.860
- You guys are so lucky

14:19.491 --> 14:21.860
that we found this car.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.929
Since y'all caused all this,

14:23.962 --> 14:26.700
y'all hoof it back up there

14:23.962 --> 14:26.700
to the shop, pay the man,

14:26.732 --> 14:28.668
you drive my car back home.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.169
I'm driving this.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.971
- Oh.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.971
- Oh, yeah, you can have that.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.405

because when we came

to get coffee

15:49.982 --> 15:51.350
the other morning,

15:51.384 --> 15:54.220
all these young kids

15:54.254 --> 15:55.422
in front of us.

cut in line

15:57.389 --> 15:59.325
in front of them,

15:57.389 --> 15:59.325

15:59.359 --> 16:00.626
pick their coffee

15:59.359 --> 16:00.626

If you just send them

16:11.370 --> 16:13.239
the message on the app

16:13.273 --> 16:15.808
of what you want,

16:13.273 --> 16:15.808
you walk in, you pick it up,

That's what those people

16:19.511 --> 16:21.681

- Of course, I'm glad

16:48.508 --> 16:49.842
I could help.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.344
- Well, we're sorry,

16:51.378 --> 16:52.946
and I'm gonna try

16:51.378 --> 16:52.946
to be on my best behavior.

- [chuckles]

16:54.313 --> 16:56.982
Okay.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.240
- Ain't it crazy, Savannah,

17:00.854 --> 17:04.240
how much this city has changed

17:04.569 --> 17:05.592
just since you moved here?

17:04.569 --> 17:05.592
- Yeah.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.326
Yeah, I love Nashville.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.595
- I hated it when

17:07.359 --> 17:08.595
I first moved here.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.529
- You did.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.529
You hated it.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.499
- And now I wouldn't

17:10.563 --> 17:12.499
live anywhere else.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.932
- Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.932
- Except for Palm Beach.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.236
- [laughs]

17:14.339 --> 17:16.236
Or any beach for that matter.

you know,

17:20.573 --> 17:21.840
chauffeuring me around,

17:21.875 --> 17:23.143
but you know

17:21.875 --> 17:23.143
where you're going?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.178
- I do, Mama.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.178
I know exactly where I'm going,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.346
but I'm not telling you.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.713

17:26.378 --> 17:27.713
specific instructions.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.182
Daddy wanted to get

17:27.747 --> 17:30.182

y'all a good table.
