WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:20.603
-[Jen] Such a weird thing that people do.
-[Judy] What? The whole shrine thing?

00:20.687 --> 00:22.397
They put all this shit here.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.400
It's not like this spot
meant anything to Ted.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.570
Well, it was the last place
he got to be alive.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.239
Yeah, I mean, it is the first place
he got to be dead too.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.411
Why is there always a cross?
People always put a cross.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.913
That is so presumptuous to me.
He was not religious.

00:38.997 --> 00:39.914
Well, hey, hey...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.791
-What?
-Maybe you should just leave it there.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.917
Just in case.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.419
In case what?

00:44.836 --> 00:45.670
Uh!

00:46.171 --> 00:48.715
In case non-existent God smites me?

00:49.674 --> 00:53.011
I'm standing next to my dead husband's
shrine on the side of a road.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.764
Trust me, I've been smited.

00:55.847 --> 00:56.806
[thunderclap]

00:56.890 --> 00:58.892
[apocalyptic music]

01:01.936 --> 01:02.854
And that's gone.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.650
Sorry.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.446
-[horn honks]
-[Jen] Here comes your boyfriend.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.074
[Judy] He's not my boyfriend,
we're just hanging out.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.951
He has very healthy boundaries,
which evidently is a real thing

01:17.035 --> 01:19.537
-people can have.
-Nope. Can't. Doesn't happen.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.206
-Does this look like a napkin?
-Nope.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.291
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.794
-Hi. Thank you for doing this.
-Of course. Hi.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.713
-It's really cool of you to come.
-Happy to be of service.

01:28.797 --> 01:32.300
[Jen] So, this is where Ted's body
was found.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.261
I guess that's one good use of the shrine.
I can always

01:35.637 --> 01:37.430
find where my husband was mowed down.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.224
Who found him?

01:39.599 --> 01:42.102
Shandy Addams. She was walking to school.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.980
-A child found him?
-Yeah. She's a classmate of Henry's.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.483
-So she's ten?
-She's nine.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.154
No traffic cams. No homes in the
eye-line. You said it was about 1:00 a.m.?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.448
Yeah. Yeah, it was 1 a.m.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.033
[Nick] No eyewitnesses, I'm guessing?

01:57.158 --> 02:00.453
No. But, I mean, there's got to be some
evidence that the police missed, right?

02:00.537 --> 02:04.165
I mean, like a cigarette butt,
or a piece of the car?

02:04.249 --> 02:06.459
Hmm. I'm sure they did a thorough search.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.171
Any usable evidence is long gone.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.434
Yeah, well, I don't really know

02:24.185 --> 02:26.563
exactly what the police did
because they won't talk to me.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.939
They have to.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.065
Well, I've...

02:30.108 --> 02:31.818
-kind of been a raging bitch.
-Demanding.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.653
Well, that's fair to say.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.488
-They hate me.
-That's also true.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.157
Okay.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.909
Well, that'll be my first stop then,
Laguna PD.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.120
They're more likely to talk
to another cop.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.497
I mean, I'm sure
they already talked to Shandy,

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
the girl that found him, right?

02:46.457 --> 02:48.960
You know, she was okay.
She went to school the next day.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
How are your kids doing, by the way?

02:51.462 --> 02:54.549
You know, people always ask me that,
and I really appreciate it.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.758
But they're... they're...

02:56.509 --> 02:57.844
surprisingly good.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.972
Yeah. Kids are just resilient.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.099
Your son's been dealing drugs.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.186
Oh, my God.

03:07.145 --> 03:12.859
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
Charles, what the hell are you thinking?

03:13.026 --> 03:13.860
[scoffs]

03:14.027 --> 03:16.404
-I was running a small business.
-Excuse me?

03:16.487 --> 03:18.573
Does your small business
have liability insurance?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.327
Because Tucker Tanner drove his Honda
through his mother's greenhouse,

03:22.660 --> 03:24.829
when he was on the drugs you sold him.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.623
Is Tucker okay?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.958
Luckily, Tucker's parents were
very understanding,

03:29.042 --> 03:32.587
considering your recent loss. Of course,
you're still responsible financially.

03:32.670 --> 03:33.630
Oh, my...

03:36.257 --> 03:37.884
What a nice fucking greenhouse.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.261
So, um...

03:42.430 --> 03:46.184
you had that property out
in Laguna Niguel, didn't you?

03:46.684 --> 03:49.354
The one... How's that going down there?

03:49.687 --> 03:50.605
How's Glenn?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.274
I wouldn't know. He moved to Temecula.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.611
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.821
-I didn't...
-No, I'm much happier now.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.366
You... you seem... changed.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.577
-Can I go now?
-You're not going anywhere ever again.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.121
You're dealing drugs?

04:07.830 --> 04:10.041
What are you? In the fucking Mafia?
Excuse me.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.419
What kind of drugs are you dealing?

04:13.503 --> 04:17.632
Uppers, downers, hydrocodone, lorazepam.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.675
Lorazepam?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.802
Yeah. [whispers] It's good.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.053
Okay.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.597
All right. Well, um...

04:26.474 --> 04:29.060
obviously, he needs to be punished,

04:29.560 --> 04:33.606
but that was Ted's department,
so I don't... What do we do?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.818
Well, normally,
I would report this to law enforcement.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.112
But given what he's been through, I won't.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.781
This time.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.533
Thank you.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.077
But I am gonna have to suspend him
for two weeks.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.788
Maybe in that time,
he can get some counseling.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.834
And I know that Pastor Wayne has a group
for troubled teens down at the church.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.336
Well, I mean, he needs to be punished,
not tortured.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.924
It would be helpful to understand
where he got the pills.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.803
Tell her where you got
the pills from, Charlie.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.721
No.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.224
I... I can't.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.891
Thank you for taking me on a ride along.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.977
It's so fascinating
to see how cops solve stuff.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.812
[laughs] No problem.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.981
You know, it's nice to have company.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.193
What do you think it does
to a nine-year-old to find a bloody corpse

06:00.276 --> 06:01.444
by the side of the road?

06:01.944 --> 06:04.947
Um... I'm gonna go with
"scars her for life."

06:06.199 --> 06:09.077
But maybe it becomes a defining moment

06:09.911 --> 06:12.789
that turns her into
an incredibly compassionate adult?

06:12.997 --> 06:14.374
No, I don't think so.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.417
Detective Perez, how can I help you?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.503
Keep in mind
I have less than five minutes.

06:18.586 --> 06:22.632
Hey, former Detective Prager.
This is my friend, Ms. Judy Hale.

06:22.965 --> 06:23.966
I know Ms. Hale.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.677
-You do?
-It's a long story. She doesn't have time.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.388
-Nice to see you.
-Hmm.

06:28.971 --> 06:29.931
Your hair looks good.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.517
So, I'm here on behalf of Jen Harding.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.520
I guess you're aware that
she's getting pretty impatient.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.356
I'm sorry. Did you say "former detective"?

06:39.774 --> 06:41.734
On leave. Santa Ana PD.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.446
Hey, maybe you know Pete Austin,

06:45.863 --> 06:47.865
transferred down here in 2012,

06:48.074 --> 06:49.951
mustache, kind of...

06:50.576 --> 06:52.036
kind of cold sense of humor?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.288
No.

06:55.540 --> 06:59.293
Okay. Well, I offered to help
Mrs. Harding out and,

06:59.377 --> 07:02.797
you know, maybe liaise with you,
help relay any information.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.716
You know this case
has been open for months.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.385
More help is not what we need.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.096
-You need a lead.
-I do. And I don't have one.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.305
Wow, not one?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.810
[sighs] I know Mrs. Harding
would like more information.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.147
But without an eyewitness, CCTV,
or a vehicle, I've got nothing.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.941
Except an angry widow running
around town like a white wine vigilante.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.945
So, former Detective,
honestly, if you want to liaise,

07:26.028 --> 07:28.573
you can tell Mrs. Harding
what the statistics are

07:28.656 --> 07:30.324
of solving a hit-and-run with no evidence.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.535
What are those statistics exactly?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.245
The Internet's all over the map on that.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.290
About eight percent of them get solved.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.584
Eight percent?

07:40.126 --> 07:41.002
Mmm.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.879
That's very low.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.965
[toilet flushing]

07:46.382 --> 07:47.300
[Charlie] All right.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.928
Here you go. Let me know if you need me
to shit in a bowl or something.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.514
You know what? You can lose the attitude,
okay, drug dealer?

07:53.931 --> 07:57.643
-What would your father say?
-Probably nothing, because he's dead.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.854
You know what?
That doesn't give you permission

07:59.937 --> 08:02.190
to throw out every single rule
and act like an asshole.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.733
Okay. You're one to talk.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.360
Okay. You know what? Hey!
I'm not fucking around right now.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.238
No laptop, no phone, no TV.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.117
That is just the start. Because I can't
think of anything more creative right now.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.536
-Whatever.
-No, not whatever. Stop. Hey!

08:16.829 --> 08:18.456
The dominoes have fallen, bro.

08:18.789 --> 08:19.749
You pushed them.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.502
And you pushed me,
which was a really bad idea.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.422
I'm not scared of you.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.133
Well, you should be scared of me.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.017
Ooh! Is that beer?
I would love one if there's more.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.769
Actually, this is Charlie's pee.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.188
There's no more,
but I'm sure he could make you some.

08:44.065 --> 08:44.982
Is he on drugs?

08:45.733 --> 08:48.903
I don't know,
but he is definitely selling pills.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.613
-No.
-Uh-huh. Yup.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.366
Ted was the good parent
and I'm the fucking terrible one.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.410
-That's not true. You're a good mom.
-Yeah. And you're a good liar.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.079
It's bad.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.206
I've just...
I've been asleep at the wheel.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.166
How are you supposed to know
what's he's doing?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.501
They're not your pills, right?

09:04.418 --> 09:05.628
No. Oh...

09:07.547 --> 09:09.423
-Look at you!
-Too formal?

09:10.007 --> 09:11.926
Uh... For a class recital, maybe.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.136
That's okay. I've got a strong second.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.263
Okay.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.056
-[buzzing]
-[Jen] Oh.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.559
What's the verdict?

09:20.601 --> 09:21.602
It's all clean.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.104
Oh, I mean, fuck!

09:23.187 --> 09:24.814
Fucking... He could've killed a kid.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.983
Imagine if he murdered someone.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.110
-I think it would be manslaughter.
-Yeah, but...

09:29.193 --> 09:30.820
It would definitely ruin his life.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.573
And him carrying
around the burden of that?

09:33.864 --> 09:34.949
Ooh, that'd be heavy.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.826
I mean, not to mention
the victim's family.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.160
And he doesn't even give a shit.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.663
-What are you gonna do?
-Make him give a shit.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.581
How?

09:41.706 --> 09:44.667
Well, a good mother
would take him to therapy,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.378
let him talk it out.
But that just takes too long. So...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.548
-I'm gonna scare the shit out of him.
-[Henry] Mom?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.842
-Hmm?
-Is this handsome?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.595
-[Jen] So handsome.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.931

09:59.015 --> 10:00.641

-He is.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
<i>♪ Because the...</i> ♪

11:21.847 --> 11:22.890
What the hell?

11:23.265 --> 11:26.477
You're doing it wrong, you stupid idiots.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.270
They just messed up the whole show.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.481
I'm quitting this stupid choir!

11:30.898 --> 11:32.483
Oh, fuck me.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.821
Unfortunately,
this isn't an isolated incident.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.618
Henry is often quick to anger
when things aren't just so.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.372
Yeah. I just don't know
why nobody told me this was happening?

11:46.455 --> 11:50.042
Oh, I would've.
But Ted was my home contact.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.877
You never updated it.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.297
He was such an involved father...

11:56.716 --> 11:59.468
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm... doing the best I can.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.012
We all miss him so much.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.475
Thank you, thank you.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.269
Oh, gosh.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.146
What happened to your arm?

12:10.479 --> 12:11.981
I got hit by a bus.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.817
Oh, my God. And that's your only injury?

12:14.900 --> 12:15.860
Yeah.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.531
Well, I ruptured my spleen,
and splintered my coccyx, and...

12:21.198 --> 12:23.701
-perforated my eardrum.
-[Jen] Oh.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.248
Hi, Shandy.

12:29.874 --> 12:30.833
Hi!

12:31.375 --> 12:33.252
You were so great up there.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.255
-You just oozed personality.
-I know.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.885
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
about everything that you went through

12:40.968 --> 12:42.261
with finding Henry's dad.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.973
I bet that was really scary for you.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.517
Are you okay?

12:50.644 --> 12:52.229
Were you by yourself that morning?

12:52.938 --> 12:56.650
Or did you see anything, um... weird?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.695
Yeah, a dead body. It was gross.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.489
Was it?

13:01.655 --> 13:04.492
Yeah, because his leg
was twisted across his body,

13:04.700 --> 13:09.455
and his face was half-on, half-off,
like someone bit it, then chewed it,

13:09.705 --> 13:13.000
then spit it back into the head.
Then hit it with a car.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.420
-Oh, that sounds very traumatizing.
-It was awesome.

13:16.712 --> 13:20.341
I went home and drew a picture of it.
But then my mom made me throw it away.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.509
Yeah, because you're morbid.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.931
I'm so sorry.
I told her to stop telling that story.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.226
She is very good with details.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.311
-It's impressive.
-It's upsetting.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.481
Which psychopath is yours?

13:37.566 --> 13:40.194
Oh, Henry. I'm a friend of his mom's.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.529
So, kind of.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.573
-I'm Judy.
-Ally.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.954
I've been meaning to come check in on Jen.
Have they caught the guy?

13:51.413 --> 13:52.331
No.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.916
Uh-uh. Um...

13:54.583 --> 13:57.336
There isn't any evidence to go on, so...

13:57.586 --> 13:58.671
Sorry to hear that.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.715
Yeah. It is a shame.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.676
Okay. So...

14:05.636 --> 14:07.471
let's leave this nice lady alone.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.849
[clears throat] Excuse us.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
Did you really need to talk to her
that whole time?

14:12.768 --> 14:16.105
[Jen] I don't understand why you stopped
the show and screamed at all those kids.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.984
Mom, all they have to do
is sing the pedal tone.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.945
But everyone wants to show off
and sing the melody.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.780
But not everyone's a natural soprano.

14:25.072 --> 14:30.703
-Mmm. I'm sorry. What's a pedal tone?
-It's literally one note over and over.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.955
They have to learn one note and sing it.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.165
One stupid note.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.959
It's, like, come on!

14:37.251 --> 14:40.045
-Were you singing your part correctly?
-Mommy, please.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.507
-I'm sorry.
-I just want it to sound good.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.968
I don't wanna be blamed
for their mistakes.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.219
But, sweetheart,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.806
the only person that anyone thought
made a mistake today was you.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.518
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.020
I get it. [scoffs]

14:57.354 --> 14:59.273
I haven't been the best example.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.400
But you know what?

15:01.859 --> 15:03.277
Mommy's got her hands on the wheel.

15:03.861 --> 15:04.695
Okay?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.071
[siren wails]

15:07.823 --> 15:09.700
-Just stay in your room. Okay?
-[siren stops]

15:11.285 --> 15:12.536
[knocking at door]

15:15.039 --> 15:16.123
Police! Open up!

15:17.374 --> 15:18.375

15:22.087 --> 15:24.089
-Hey.
-[Nick, whispering] All right. Here we go.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.341
[Nick] Where's Charlie?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.012
What's going on? Mom?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.139
Yeah? Hi. What's happening here?

15:32.222 --> 15:34.767
Please stay where you are, ma'am.
You, up against the wall. Now!

15:34.850 --> 15:36.393
Hands on the wall, spread your legs.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.313
-This is gonna scare the shit out of him.
-Oh, my God. It scared me.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.023
[Jen] Officer, I don't understand.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.025
The school said
they wouldn't call the authorities.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.568
Well, somebody did.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.615
Charlie here has gotten himself
mixed up in some pretty dangerous shit.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.368
Okay. I was just selling to my friends.
I swear.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.870
Before I search you,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.456
are there any sharp objects
in your pockets I should be aware of?

15:57.539 --> 15:58.499
-No.
-No?

15:58.582 --> 15:59.959
Yeah. My lucky pen.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.585
Oh! [mouths] The lucky pen.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.629
Mom, can't you do something?

16:03.754 --> 16:04.797
No, I cannot.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.090
Is this your bag?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.801
-Don't...
-Don't "don't" me, son.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.554
-Oh, my God. You are doing so good.
-Super sexy.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.225
Something in your bag
you don't want me to find, huh?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.603
Some... drugs, maybe?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.648
You know, some pills?

16:27.152 --> 16:27.987
The fuck is this?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.822
-[Jen] Jesus Christ!
-[Judy] Holy shit!

16:31.532 --> 16:34.660
-What the hell are you doing with a gun?
-Where did you get this gun, Charlie?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.954
I stole it from Grandma.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.789
-The safety is off.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.709
Okay. I'm done playing here. Okay.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.627
-This is way more serious.
-No, it's fine.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.171
How long has this been
bouncing around your backpack loaded?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.715
You could have killed somebody.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.883
Statistically, yourself.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.721
I... I wasn't gonna use it. I swear.
I just took it in case something happens.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.639
In case what happened, honey?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.516
I don't know. Something bad. I'm sorry.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.601
Honey. Honey!

16:59.685 --> 17:01.103
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.939
Let's just call it off, right, guys?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.232
You can do that? I mean...

17:05.315 --> 17:07.860
Yeah, I can, because I'm
a very powerful woman, so...

17:11.530 --> 17:12.823
Somebody could've gotten shot.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.783
God, I know.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.078
Nothing more dangerous
than a stupid kid with a gun.

17:19.038 --> 17:19.913
Are you okay?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.250
It's how it happened.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.170
With my partner, Lucas.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.175
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. Thanks.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.348
Is there anything I can do
to help you... feel better?

17:40.392 --> 17:43.228
-Mmm... I can maybe think of something.
-Mmm!

17:44.438 --> 17:46.940
First, I should probably
get rid of this gun, though, you know?

17:47.941 --> 17:50.027
-Yeah. Please.
-Immediately and safely.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.946
So, lunch tomorrow?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.448
Yes. I would love that.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.201
-Can you wear that outfit?
-[laughs]

17:57.409 --> 18:00.037
-Because I would also love that.
-Okay. Let me think about it.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.288
-Okay.
-All right.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.048
"In case something bad happens."
I mean, what does that even mean?

18:11.757 --> 18:12.841
I don't know.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.261
Oh, my baby. Why doesn't he feel safe?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.097
It's scary being a kid.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.183
Especially if your dad's taken away
from you in the middle of the night.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.352
Right.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.023
I never knew my dad
and I was a basket case.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.318
Well, I knew my dad
and I was a fucking peach.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.822
-Oh, seriously?
-No, I was a total cunt. My mom hated me.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.156
[both laugh]

18:37.491 --> 18:41.078
Oh, God! Why did he have to have a gun?
I fucking hate guns.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.205
-Don't you have one in that safe?
-No, that's Ted's.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.333
-Lorna gave it to him for Christmas.
-No.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.418
-In his stocking.
-No!

18:48.502 --> 18:49.336
Yeah.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.339
-Oh, my God. She loves guns.
-I know.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.758
What am I gonna do?

18:55.759 --> 19:00.055
I mean, I should be able to make him feel
protected and...

19:00.514 --> 19:05.644
secure and watched over. I mean,
that's what a good parent does, right?

19:06.728 --> 19:09.106
I think that's what God does for people.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.734
Gives them a sense of security
that there's a higher power.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.319
Even if it is all bullshit.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.113
Is that why you kept that thing?

19:17.072 --> 19:18.615
I didn't feel right throwing it out.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.034
Now you're covering all the bases.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.203
I can use all the help I can get.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.543
They were Ted's pills.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.629
That Charlie was selling. They were Ted's.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.465
-All of them?
-Yeah.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.513
Do you think maybe he had, like,
a problem?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.016
I honestly don't know. I...

19:44.892 --> 19:46.894
If he did, I didn't see it.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.606
It's just crazy. You can live
in the same house with someone

19:50.689 --> 19:52.941
and have no idea
what they're going through.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.695
[Jen sighs]

20:03.035 --> 20:04.536
So Ted took a lot of pills.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.455
He was cheating.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.000
And he goes out running at 1:00 a.m.?
Who does that?

20:10.250 --> 20:13.212
I mean, maybe he was depressed
and he threw himself in front of that car.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.463
It's possible.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.547
Hmm?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.799
It was a shitty thing to do
to that family.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.219
Maybe he was filled with pain.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.720
Or guilt.

20:21.803 --> 20:22.638
Hmm.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.057
-Shitty thing to do to that driver.
-Right?

20:25.432 --> 20:27.017
It's far more likely if he was on pills

20:27.100 --> 20:29.144
that he stumbled on the road
when the car was coming.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.188
-Hmm.
-But, you know, um...

20:32.773 --> 20:37.611
every time we're together,
we don't have to talk about Ted.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.488
-Of course.
-[Nick laughs]

20:40.572 --> 20:42.282
I like being with you, Judy.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.409
Uh, it makes me feel good.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.912
It makes me feel good too.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.833
Sorry, but if Ted stumbled,
it wouldn't be the driver's fault, right?

20:52.626 --> 20:53.543
Right.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.257
Are there also cases where the victim is
intoxicated and stumbles out on the road,

20:58.340 --> 21:00.300
and the driver who hits them gets off?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.303
Sure. If they stop driving.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.723
See, the hit isn't the crime.
The run, that's the crime.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.559
-Right.
-But that doesn't really matter here.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.437
-Why not?
-'Cause there's no evidence

21:12.521 --> 21:13.355
pointing us to a car.

21:13.438 --> 21:17.067
There's no car pointing us to a person.
So, no car, no crime.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.737
-No car, no crime?
-Mm-hm.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.782
[voice echoing] No car, no crime.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.035
[Wayne] So what do you do
when faced with a choice

21:27.411 --> 21:30.497
that could change the destiny
of your entire life?

21:31.456 --> 21:35.210
You make one bad decision
and you spend the rest of your life

21:35.419 --> 21:38.422

you didn't even know you were digging.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.925

what constitutes a good decision.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.771
Oh, they're amazing.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.899
Oh, well, maybe somebody wants
to be a Holy Harmonizer.

22:38.982 --> 22:39.816
[Henry] Really?

22:40.359 --> 22:44.279
I mean, I'm not quite on their level.
But I work hard and I care.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.948
Henry, the group is always
looking for boys.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.159
No. No, no.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.995
-Why? Mom.
-Okay. Not to overstep,

22:52.454 --> 22:57.334
but this would be good for him
and it'd be mean if you didn't let him.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.336
Hmm?

23:00.295 --> 23:02.506
-Can we just try?
-[Henry] Please? I'll do anything.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.424
Please. Can I at least just try?

23:05.675 --> 23:07.511
Oh... fine.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.931
-[Jen] Godspeed, kid.
-[Henry] Thank you. Let's go!

23:13.975 --> 23:15.644

[doorbell]

23:20.982 --> 23:22.025
[Jen] Ally, hi.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.444
Sorry for dropping by unannounced.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.866
I just had a little chat with Shandy
about the morning she found Ted's corpse.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.284
Just say body.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.829
-Right.
-[Jen] Yeah.

23:33.995 --> 23:34.913
Sorry.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.542
Shandy has something
she needs to show you.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.963
Hand it over.

23:46.716 --> 23:50.387
She took a little souvenir
from the site of Ted's accident.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.765
And now I have to deal with the fact
that my child's a sociopath.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.142
What is that?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.769
[Ally] I think it's maybe
from a headlight.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.187
Maybe.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.606
[exhales]

24:02.441 --> 24:04.818
Maybe it'll help lead the police
to the car that did it?

24:05.235 --> 24:06.111
Oh, my God.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.113
[Ally] I'm so sorry.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.199
-It was stuck to Mr. Harding's cadaver.
-[Ally] Body!

24:12.075 --> 24:14.411
[heartbeat]

24:16.371 --> 24:17.289
Thank you.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.841
-If you ever wanna grab a coffee or...
-No.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.179
[Judy, under her breath]
No car, no crime. No car, no crime.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.931
[dog barking]

24:55.535 --> 24:56.745
