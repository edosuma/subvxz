55:29.744 --> 55:31.655
It's not connected to the lymphoma.

55:33.498 --> 55:34.863
Silver linings.

55:36.918 --> 55:37.907
(CHUCKLES)

55:38.669 --> 55:40.330
You live alone now, Albert?

55:43.341 --> 55:45.957
Since Lorraine passed.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.593
-But you...
-Three children, yes.

55:50.223 --> 55:51.429
Mmm.

55:55.019 --> 55:56.099
(CHUCKLES)

55:57.522 --> 55:59.262
(BIRD SQUAWKING)

56:00.066 --> 56:04.355
We're, what, two blocks
from the Fourth District Station?

56:04.445 --> 56:05.605
That's right.

56:07.490 --> 56:10.357
-There's my baby, what's left of her.
-(EXHALES)

56:11.953 --> 56:13.238
Thought she was gone for good

56:13.329 --> 56:15.911
until the Homeland Security guys
told me they found her.

56:18.960 --> 56:22.452
It looks like somebody tried to hide the car
after they torched it, you know?

56:22.713 --> 56:25.625
They didn't do too good a job of it.
Kids be playing down here regular.

56:26.259 --> 56:28.170
They probably the ones who turned it over.

56:30.263 --> 56:32.379
Or the city moved it
when they trimmed those trees.

56:34.392 --> 56:35.723
Are there tags?

56:35.810 --> 56:37.971
I took 'em off and turned 'em in to the DMV.

56:39.605 --> 56:40.890
But you can prove it's your car?

56:41.691 --> 56:43.556
You can still read the VIN number
on the dash.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.395
Matches the number on my title.

56:57.373 --> 56:58.829
You gonna leave it here?

56:59.709 --> 57:01.165
Can't do nothing with it.

57:02.044 --> 57:04.126
Insurance company thinks
I burned the car myself

57:04.213 --> 57:05.544
to collect from the loss.

57:06.090 --> 57:07.626
Why would I do that?

57:07.967 --> 57:10.174
Shoot, I still got a loan out on that car.

57:10.928 --> 57:13.840
Paying a $250-a-month note
on a vehicle I ain't never gonna drive.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.092
No good deed, man.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.889
That's what I know.
