WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.803
I want to work with you on
the pro bono, predatory lending,

00:03.839 --> 00:05.461
taking advantage
of people of color.

00:05.497 --> 00:07.637
We have 123 plaintiffs

00:07.673 --> 00:09.844
who were all steered
into higher-rate mortgages.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.349
And he's using fools like you
to cover his own ass.

00:12.385 --> 00:14.581
I would never work for a place
that engaged in discrimination,

00:14.617 --> 00:16.515
and I more than happy
to say that on the stand.

00:16.551 --> 00:19.547
This case isn't about
race or money.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.677
The man who heads up
this company is a predator,

00:21.713 --> 00:23.916
and your aunt worked for him
25 years ago,

00:23.952 --> 00:25.257
made her life a living hell.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.669
- Because she was black?
- Because she was beautiful.

00:27.705 --> 00:29.607
Your Honor, I would like
to introduce this document.

00:29.643 --> 00:32.284
Unless he has the actual memo
it refers to,

00:32.320 --> 00:33.910
this article itself
is inadmissible.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.848
The reason that I would like
to have entered that article

00:35.884 --> 00:37.027
is to show that he
buried the memo.

00:37.063 --> 00:38.480
- That is a lie.
- It's not a lie.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.359
I can prove it.

00:39.395 --> 00:40.958
He's calling me to the stand
in two days.

00:40.994 --> 00:42.098
Then we need
to get you prepared

00:42.134 --> 00:43.690
- in front of an audience.
- A mock trial?

00:43.726 --> 00:44.988
I'm not putting Donna
through that.

00:45.024 --> 00:47.096
I've been subpoenaed by
the Attorney General's Office.

00:47.132 --> 00:49.143
You are asking me
to go personal again.

00:49.179 --> 00:50.760
And I won't do it.

00:50.796 --> 00:53.150
I am asking you
to protect me again.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.245
And I am telling you
it's okay to do it.

00:55.281 --> 00:57.575
Do you regret putting Harvey
over this guy?

00:57.611 --> 01:00.150
I regret
putting Harvey over myself.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.817
What was wrong
with the other one?

01:07.856 --> 01:08.790
What?

01:08.826 --> 01:11.696
That's the third tie
you've put on.

01:11.758 --> 01:14.113
Oh, I just didn't like
how the other two looked.

01:14.184 --> 01:15.561
Harvey, what's going on?

01:15.658 --> 01:18.403
I've never known you to second-
guess yourself before trial.

01:18.439 --> 01:21.567
Nothing's going on.
I just needed the right tie.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.648
Does that maybe have to do
with this man

01:23.702 --> 01:25.849
coming after Donna?

01:25.966 --> 01:27.810
No, just has to do
with the fact

01:27.865 --> 01:30.917
that I have to rely on Louis
to prepare my own case.

01:30.956 --> 01:33.379
It's okay that you're
worried about her.

01:33.415 --> 01:34.967
I don't feel threatened
by you having another woman

01:35.003 --> 01:36.708
in your life
that you care about.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.371
In fact, your loyalty
is one of the things

01:38.418 --> 01:40.329
I've always admired about you.

01:40.381 --> 01:42.174
- It is?
- Yeah, of course.

01:42.210 --> 01:43.936
You've felt betrayed
at one time or another

01:44.019 --> 01:47.154
by almost every person
you've ever cared about,

01:47.275 --> 01:48.534
and in spite of that,

01:48.570 --> 01:50.584
you protect them whenever
they're threatened.

01:50.631 --> 01:51.591
Of course I do.
Anybody would.

01:51.627 --> 01:55.076
No, not anybody would,
but you do,

01:55.122 --> 01:56.881
and that's why Donna and all
the other people in your life

01:56.917 --> 01:58.453
are lucky to have you.

02:00.138 --> 02:01.649
Thanks, Paula.

02:01.905 --> 02:03.007
Good luck today.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.333 --> 02:17.232
Alex, wherever
you're going, turn around.

02:17.268 --> 02:19.268
Malik subpoenaed Donna,
so it's all hands on deck.

02:19.304 --> 02:20.288
And I'd love to help, Harvey,

02:20.325 --> 02:21.560
but I need
to get to another deck.

02:21.615 --> 02:23.182
- What happened?
- Bratton Gould happened.

02:23.253 --> 02:24.154
I thought
we took care of them.

02:24.239 --> 02:25.308
We took care of Bratton,

02:25.344 --> 02:26.753
and now the other one
wants revenge.

02:26.789 --> 02:28.244
- How?
- How do you think?

02:28.289 --> 02:31.278
- Shit, Pfizer.
- Yup, Pfizer.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.565
- You need help?
- Harvey, if I needed help,

02:33.622 --> 02:35.792
I wouldn't have landed
Pfizer in the first place.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.814
Alex.

02:39.851 --> 02:41.587
Go get 'em.

02:46.882 --> 02:50.182
Well, that was the 42nd time
we've read that.

02:50.218 --> 02:51.807
- Have you changed your mind?
- Nope.

02:51.877 --> 02:53.497
That boy was stupid
for telling Elizabeth

02:53.552 --> 02:56.417
to go away
in the first place.

02:56.461 --> 02:59.795
- What are you two reading?
- What do you think?

02:59.855 --> 03:01.788
Ah, Elizabeth.

03:01.957 --> 03:04.095
You know, we got the idea
for your middle name from her.

03:04.189 --> 03:05.067
That's not true.

03:05.103 --> 03:06.906
Well, you are just like her

03:06.953 --> 03:08.838
because she doesn't let boys
tell her what to do either.

03:08.874 --> 03:12.124
And she's also
just like her mother.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.527
Now, go read over there
for a minute.

03:13.616 --> 03:15.351
I want to talk to your aunt.

03:17.345 --> 03:19.819
- That girl is something else.
- Don't I know it?

03:20.942 --> 03:23.610
What's going on
with the guy at work?

03:23.646 --> 03:25.542
You don't need to worry
about that, Robbie.

03:25.589 --> 03:26.468
I can take care of it.

03:26.506 --> 03:27.194
I'm telling you,

03:27.230 --> 03:28.154
the best way
to take care of it

03:28.190 --> 03:30.180
is to quietly
get yourself transferred

03:30.216 --> 03:32.292
and not make any trouble.

03:32.328 --> 03:34.460
Well, that is not
who I am,

03:34.496 --> 03:35.587
and if you don't know that
by now...

03:35.623 --> 03:37.556
Yeah, I know, I know.

03:37.643 --> 03:40.841
You, Rachel, Elizabeth,
and Laura, hell,

03:40.877 --> 03:42.469
a man can't swing
a dead cat around here

03:42.525 --> 03:44.427
without hitting
a strong-willed woman.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.765
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

03:53.384 --> 03:55.238
I was just thinking
about the case.

03:55.305 --> 03:57.471
So was I, and I think
I have a way

03:57.521 --> 03:58.925
to keep it
from getting dismissed.

03:58.961 --> 03:59.956
All right, let's hear it.

04:00.014 --> 04:01.647
The company says
they have protocols in place

04:01.683 --> 04:03.761
to prevent discrimination,
but we also know

04:03.797 --> 04:06.102
that they have a CEO
who takes advantage of women.

04:06.161 --> 04:07.294
If you're talking
about Jasmine...

04:07.368 --> 04:09.301
I'm talking about women.

04:09.357 --> 04:10.786
- What's your point?
- My point is, a man

04:10.822 --> 04:12.212
who did what he did
to Aunt Jasmine

04:12.300 --> 04:14.191
has done this to other women,
which means...

04:14.242 --> 04:15.355
Rachel, that's not
discrimination.

04:15.391 --> 04:16.922
- That's harassment.
- No, Dad, it's treating

04:17.000 --> 04:18.108
a group of people
differently,

04:18.144 --> 04:20.170
which is the definition
of discrimination.

04:20.206 --> 04:23.177
And it sets the stage for us
to argue a pattern.

04:24.751 --> 04:25.855
Then I guess we need
to find someone

04:25.891 --> 04:27.271
he's done this to before.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.517
That's the thing.

04:28.556 --> 04:29.925
I think I already have.

04:35.945 --> 04:38.244
Is it time?
I'll be there in five minutes.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.481
I just need a second
to gather myself.

04:40.553 --> 04:41.494
You can take
all the time you need

04:41.530 --> 04:42.622
because we're not
doing this trial.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.213
Louis, what the hell
are you talking about?

04:44.249 --> 04:45.707
Malik's gonna come
after me on that stand,

04:45.773 --> 04:46.821
and you're supposed
to get me ready.

04:46.857 --> 04:47.712
That's what I'm saying.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.481
You're not gonna have to get up
on that stand at all.

04:49.517 --> 04:50.690
What's going on here?

04:50.726 --> 04:52.663
We got a library full of people
waiting for you two.

04:52.699 --> 04:54.089
I was just about
to come down there,

04:54.125 --> 04:55.231
and now Louis
is trying to tell me

04:55.267 --> 04:56.798
that I don't have
to go up against Malik.

04:56.872 --> 04:58.621
Louis, the judge issued
a subpoena.

04:58.657 --> 04:59.619
She's got to take the stand.

04:59.655 --> 05:01.360
No, she doesn't.
Don't you see?

05:01.396 --> 05:03.844
You worked in the DA's office.
She was your secretary.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.155
And you both worked
on the Clifford Danner case.

05:06.191 --> 05:08.235
Holy shit, it's work product.

05:08.287 --> 05:11.121
It's covered under privilege.
Louis, you're a genius.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.489
Let's go clear out
that library.

05:12.525 --> 05:14.239
Hold on a second.

05:14.275 --> 05:16.619
The whole point of doing
a mock trial is to prepare me.

05:16.662 --> 05:18.028
What's the downside
of still doing that

05:18.084 --> 05:19.205
in case this doesn't work?

05:19.255 --> 05:20.886
The downside is that
I won't have enough time

05:20.922 --> 05:22.559
to prepare
the argument for court.

05:22.595 --> 05:24.298
- I don't see how that...
- Harvey, do I need to tell you

05:24.334 --> 05:26.296
that when I'm finished,
you can't be the one to make it?

05:26.332 --> 05:27.759
- No, you don't.
- Why not?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.747
Because Malik's trying
to make this case about me,

05:29.821 --> 05:32.924
which means the more we can
have Mike talk, the better.

06:07.092 --> 06:09.617
Subtitles by explosiveskull

06:09.653 --> 06:11.291
Hey, what's going on?
Where are they?

06:11.355 --> 06:13.057
It doesn't matter.
The mock trial's off.

06:13.093 --> 06:14.355
- What do you mean it's off?
- Louis came up

06:14.391 --> 06:16.115
with a work product
exemption argument.

06:16.164 --> 06:17.811
Donna doesn't have
to testify at all.

06:17.847 --> 06:19.167
You got the judge to agree
to that already?

06:19.215 --> 06:20.795
He didn't agree.
Louis is gonna work on it,

06:20.857 --> 06:21.711
and you're gonna argue it,

06:21.747 --> 06:23.401
so why don't you get down
to his office and get busy?

06:23.460 --> 06:25.185
Harvey, that's a great plan,
but are you sure

06:25.221 --> 06:26.928
we're not skipping this
just to save Donna

06:26.970 --> 06:28.177
embarrassment
in front of the firm?

06:28.218 --> 06:29.982
No, Mike, we're skipping
this thing to stop

06:30.018 --> 06:32.294
that asshole from going
after her in open court.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.352
I get that. It's just that
when someone is special to you,

06:34.400 --> 06:37.225
it can... mess up your judgment.

06:37.261 --> 06:39.351
And when I want your advice
on my personal life,

06:39.413 --> 06:42.273
I'll ask for it, so unless
you think you can't handle it

06:42.309 --> 06:43.659
and I have to tell Louis
to do it...

06:43.695 --> 06:44.687
I can handle it, Harvey.

06:44.761 --> 06:47.271
Then walk yourself down
to Louis' office and get ready

06:47.307 --> 06:50.827
because we're shutting
this son of a bitch down today.

06:56.098 --> 06:57.697
Hey, Shelley, is he in?

06:57.733 --> 06:59.691
Never mind,
I'll just go see for myself.

06:59.727 --> 07:00.906
Alex, wait.
Is he expecting you?

07:00.942 --> 07:02.207
I sure as shit hope not.

07:02.243 --> 07:03.647
Did you really think
I was gonna let you

07:03.683 --> 07:05.059
get away
with poaching my client?

07:05.095 --> 07:08.597
I didn't think anything,
and I'm not poaching anyone

07:08.978 --> 07:10.519
because we signed
an agreement not to touch

07:10.555 --> 07:13.080
any of your precious clients
with a 10-foot pole.

07:13.116 --> 07:15.315
No, you just happened to
manufacture a hostile takeover

07:15.390 --> 07:16.338
of my biggest client.

07:16.374 --> 07:18.582
I have a legal obligation
to assist my client

07:18.618 --> 07:20.084
in whatever decisions they make,

07:20.120 --> 07:22.289
and if that obligation
happens to result in me

07:22.325 --> 07:24.225
drinking your milkshake,

07:24.275 --> 07:25.697
well, that's just
a side benefit.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.943
Well, while you're drinking
that shake, choke on this.

07:29.014 --> 07:31.602
My client is suing yours
for unfair business practices,

07:31.638 --> 07:34.739
and there's no way the FTC lets
a company suing their competitor

07:34.775 --> 07:36.382
get acquired by that competitor.

07:36.418 --> 07:38.860
In that case, you better
be ready to file another one

07:38.896 --> 07:40.996
because this thing
is gonna get tossed

07:41.032 --> 07:42.782
before you get back
to your little office.

07:42.818 --> 07:45.033
I'm ready, Eli,
and in case you forgot,

07:45.082 --> 07:47.147
the last time one of you two
went up against me,

07:47.206 --> 07:48.813
his name was Tommy Bratton,

07:48.849 --> 07:51.852
and I don't know if you noticed,
he doesn't work here anymore.

07:55.762 --> 07:57.696
<i>At first,
I tried to laugh it off,</i>

07:58.427 --> 08:00.303
but Arthur kept hitting on me,
so I told him

08:00.369 --> 08:02.252
I wasn't interested
and asked him to stop.

08:02.288 --> 08:03.608
- And did he?
- No, he didn't.

08:03.644 --> 08:06.115
Finally I didn't get a promotion
that I'd been promised.

08:07.733 --> 08:10.378
He said it was because
of poor performance reviews.

08:10.439 --> 08:11.612
Which you understood
to mean

08:11.659 --> 08:12.840
that you wouldn't
sleep with him.

08:12.876 --> 08:15.044
Yes.
When I accused him of that,

08:15.112 --> 08:17.113
he said if I brought it up
again, I would lose my job.

08:17.149 --> 08:19.116
Six weeks later,
I was fired anyway.

08:19.164 --> 08:22.057
Arthur Kittredge
made my life a living hell.

08:22.975 --> 08:24.314
Your Honor,
the prosecution calls

08:24.350 --> 08:25.818
Donna Paulsen to the stand.

08:25.854 --> 08:27.765
Your Honor, I move to have
that witness disallowed.

08:27.801 --> 08:28.389
On what grounds?

08:28.425 --> 08:30.093
On the grounds that
he's only calling the witness

08:30.129 --> 08:31.731
because he has
a personal ax to grind.

08:31.806 --> 08:34.034
Your Honor, we vehemently deny
these accusations,

08:34.070 --> 08:34.803
but it doesn't matter

08:34.839 --> 08:36.841
because what they're claiming
isn't discrimination.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.049
It turned into discrimination
the second Arthur Kittredge

08:39.086 --> 08:40.287
passed her over for a promotion

08:40.342 --> 08:41.457
because she wouldn't
sleep with him.

08:41.493 --> 08:43.370
That's outrageous
and inflammatory,

08:43.429 --> 08:45.382
and even if it were true,
what does any of it have to do

08:45.418 --> 08:47.562
with how a company determines
who gets what mortgage rate?

08:47.637 --> 08:48.560
I'm trying to explain
to the court

08:48.627 --> 08:51.051
why you'd call a witness
whose testimony is privileged.

08:51.087 --> 08:52.182
How exactly is it privileged?

08:52.218 --> 08:54.050
Because it's work product,
on a case, by the way,

08:54.086 --> 08:55.950
that made Harvey Specter's
name instead of yours,

08:56.056 --> 08:58.020
and now you're trying to use it
to smear his reputation.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.733
Your Honor, Clifford Danner
has nothing to do

08:59.815 --> 09:00.909
with Elmont Investments.

09:00.952 --> 09:03.274
Donna Paulsen's work on it
is covered under privilege,

09:03.321 --> 09:05.998
and this entire case
should be thrown out right now.

09:06.068 --> 09:07.147
<i>And if you'll
pardon my French,</i>

09:07.183 --> 09:09.494
that is the biggest load
of bullshit I have ever heard.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.870
You can think whatever
you want, Counselor,

09:10.906 --> 09:13.233
but the 12th Circuit
in California felt differently.

09:13.269 --> 09:16.347
Your Honor, we have precedent.
We have testimony.

09:16.396 --> 09:18.852
- And we have a pattern.
- Ms. Sonowski.

09:18.929 --> 09:20.395
If there is a culture
of discrimination

09:20.468 --> 09:21.413
within your company,

09:21.449 --> 09:23.944
the CEO is a reasonable person
to ask about it.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.149
Mr. Kittredge will submit to a
deposition in the next 24 hours.

09:28.613 --> 09:29.552
Your Honor,
the only reputation

09:29.588 --> 09:30.984
being smeared here is mine,

09:31.059 --> 09:32.672
but more importantly,
I agree.

09:32.730 --> 09:34.632
Clifford Danner has
nothing to do with this.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.654
In fact, if anything
even remotely resembling

09:36.721 --> 09:37.982
that name comes out of my mouth,

09:38.064 --> 09:40.300
feel free to hold me in
contempt, but in the meantime,

09:40.336 --> 09:41.670
unless the defense
would like to bring up

09:41.706 --> 09:43.052
what I had for lunch
in the third grade,

09:43.097 --> 09:45.789
I'd like to call my witness.

09:45.825 --> 09:47.857
Your Honor...

09:47.893 --> 09:50.104
Ms. Paulsen,
please take the stand.

09:58.778 --> 10:01.570
Ms. Paulsen, could you please
state your employment history

10:01.606 --> 10:03.344
prior to becoming
a legal secretary?

10:03.380 --> 10:04.536
I was an actress.

10:04.572 --> 10:05.954
And were you able to make
a living at that?

10:05.990 --> 10:09.154
No, I worked as a waitress
to supplement my income,

10:09.203 --> 10:09.939
but I don't see what that has...

10:09.988 --> 10:11.744
And how much do you
make now, Ms. Paulsen?

10:11.780 --> 10:14.492
- Somewhere in the six figures?
- Yes.

10:14.930 --> 10:16.647
That's quite an improvement
on minimum wage plus tips,

10:16.683 --> 10:18.650
- wouldn't you say?
- What can I say?

10:18.686 --> 10:19.756
I'm very good at what I do.

10:19.792 --> 10:20.974
And was shredding
a document related

10:21.016 --> 10:23.158
to the Coastal Motors Case
that your firm tried years ago

10:23.248 --> 10:25.064
one of the things that you
were good at doing?

10:25.708 --> 10:26.600
Oh, shit.

10:26.636 --> 10:27.811
How the hell does he know
about that?

10:27.847 --> 10:28.791
Doesn't matter.
He knows.

10:28.827 --> 10:29.983
Ms. Paulsen,
I'll ask you again.

10:30.025 --> 10:31.324
Did you destroy evidence
on that case?

10:31.360 --> 10:32.960
And I'll remind you
that you're under oath.

10:32.996 --> 10:35.426
Objection. The document
he's referring to was fake.

10:35.481 --> 10:37.688
It's not illegal to get rid
of fraudulent documents.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.072
Did she know that
when she destroyed it?

10:39.108 --> 10:40.264
It doesn't matter,
so unless he plans

10:40.300 --> 10:41.959
to prosecute the witness
for doing her job...

10:42.032 --> 10:43.325
I plan to ask
the witness questions.

10:43.361 --> 10:44.251
I'd like
the chance to do that.

10:44.292 --> 10:46.096
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Specter, back off.

10:46.132 --> 10:47.870
The witness will answer
the question.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.366
- Yes, I shredded the file.
- At your boss' request.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.963
- No.
- Ms. Paulsen, were you fired

10:54.002 --> 10:55.093
during the Coastal Motors trial

10:55.132 --> 10:56.833
and then rehired
one week later?

10:56.902 --> 10:57.881
- Yes, but I...
- And since then,

10:57.946 --> 10:59.655
you've become your firm's
chief operating officer,

10:59.691 --> 11:01.153
but you're not a lawyer,
are you?

11:01.189 --> 11:02.794
You don't need to be
a lawyer to be a COO.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.395
- And do you have an MBA?
- No, I don't.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.671
Of course you don't.

11:05.743 --> 11:07.186
All you have is
a bachelor's in theater,

11:07.222 --> 11:09.087
and you were a part-time
waitress, part-time actress

11:09.123 --> 11:10.730
when you quit to become
a legal secretary,

11:10.766 --> 11:12.465
which is what you were
until Harvey Specter

11:12.501 --> 11:14.169
made you COO overnight.

11:14.205 --> 11:16.134
Tell me, do you have any
of the qualifications

11:16.170 --> 11:17.617
normally required
for that position?

11:17.653 --> 11:19.753
I have been at the firm
longer than anyone.

11:19.789 --> 11:20.759
I know how it works...

11:20.795 --> 11:22.278
Oh, so do I,
by breaking the law

11:22.314 --> 11:23.546
and then rewarding
the people that do.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.243
That's a lie!

11:24.292 --> 11:25.560
Well, then how did you
get your promotion?

11:25.620 --> 11:27.011
Because there's only two ways
I can think of

11:27.066 --> 11:29.074
when you're not qualified, and
they're both pretty distasteful.

11:29.157 --> 11:30.268
Objection!
That's inflammatory.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.875
Answer the question.

11:31.911 --> 11:34.685
I'll tell you how I got it.
I asked for it.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.935
You asked for it?
Well.

11:38.995 --> 11:39.986
You know,
if that's all it takes,

11:40.031 --> 11:42.149
maybe I should ask Mr. Specter
for a pony,

11:42.185 --> 11:43.338
except I don't think
that's all it takes.

11:43.376 --> 11:46.198
I think it takes destroying
evidence, getting fake fired,

11:46.234 --> 11:47.753
and a little acting ability
to pull it off.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.920
- Your Honor, he's testifying!
- Yeah, well,

11:48.993 --> 11:49.936
then I'll wrap it up because

11:49.972 --> 11:51.776
if she was willing to destroy
evidence in that case,

11:51.812 --> 11:52.938
she's willing to do it
in this one,

11:52.974 --> 11:54.514
and that is why
the memo referred to

11:54.595 --> 11:56.595
in that article
no longer exists.

11:56.631 --> 11:58.123
- Your Honor...
- I've heard enough.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.581
This case is moving forward,

11:59.617 --> 12:02.188
and I'm allowing that article
to be admitted as evidence.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.348
Jasmine, I told you the best
way to handle this was quietly.

12:12.384 --> 12:13.232
And I told you that man

12:13.268 --> 12:15.189
deserves to be exposed
for what he is.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.274
You think I don't
know that?

12:16.310 --> 12:17.472
Then why won't you
take my case?

12:17.508 --> 12:19.558
Because what people deserve
and what they get

12:19.594 --> 12:20.965
- aren't the same thing.
- And what happened

12:21.001 --> 12:22.756
to the big brother who said
he'd always protect me?

12:22.792 --> 12:23.595
I'll tell you what happened.

12:23.631 --> 12:26.054
You told him you were
gonna handle this your way.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.623
No. You won't do this
because you're worried

12:28.659 --> 12:30.668
how it'll look to your bosses
at that fancy law firm.

12:30.704 --> 12:31.684
So what if I am?

12:31.720 --> 12:33.593
I worked my whole life
to get into Harvard Law,

12:33.629 --> 12:35.060
and then I got hired
at the kind of place

12:35.096 --> 12:36.420
that doesn't hire people
like you and me.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.294
I got my toe in a door that's
usually slammed in our faces,

12:39.365 --> 12:41.349
and if I take a case
like this out the gate,

12:41.385 --> 12:42.519
they'll let me go
in a heartbeat.

12:42.555 --> 12:43.910
Maybe they will,
but if you ask me...

12:43.982 --> 12:46.155
I'm not asking you, Jasmine,

12:46.230 --> 12:47.718
but you're asking me
to risk everything

12:47.803 --> 12:49.612
for a case that I can't win.

12:49.648 --> 12:52.883
No, Robbie,
I asked you to do this

12:52.956 --> 12:55.585
because that man
shattered my life,

12:55.621 --> 12:57.464
and I don't know how
I'm gonna pick myself up,

12:57.500 --> 12:58.600
but I thought at least
I could do this

12:58.636 --> 13:00.768
knowing that you had my back.

13:01.097 --> 13:01.973
Jasmine.

13:02.009 --> 13:03.117
You just make sure
you get your foot

13:03.176 --> 13:05.145
all the way in
that goddamn door.

13:15.093 --> 13:16.780
- Harvey.
- I know what you're gonna say,

13:16.816 --> 13:17.978
that we should have had
the mock trial.

13:18.014 --> 13:18.763
Well, I don't want to hear it.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.525
I wasn't gonna say that,
Harvey; I was gonna say

13:20.561 --> 13:21.667
that if he puts her
on the stand again

13:21.703 --> 13:22.977
- in front of that jury...
- It's gonna look even worse

13:23.013 --> 13:24.527
- than it did just now?
- Jenna...

13:24.599 --> 13:26.159
You're not gonna talk
your way out of this.

13:26.203 --> 13:27.237
The last time we were in there,

13:27.273 --> 13:28.846
you said when it was over,
we'd win.

13:28.882 --> 13:30.696
Well, instead of us winning,
he gets to use a memo

13:30.774 --> 13:31.912
that doesn't even exist.

13:31.948 --> 13:34.551
Not that doesn't exist,
that you didn't write.

13:34.587 --> 13:35.699
What are you talking about?

13:35.735 --> 13:37.570
I think what Harvey's saying
is that Malik put the squeeze

13:37.606 --> 13:39.110
on someone in your company,

13:39.146 --> 13:41.468
and to get him off their back,
they went to the newspaper

13:41.504 --> 13:43.087
and said there was a memo
that you wrote.

13:43.123 --> 13:44.035
Even if that's true,

13:44.071 --> 13:45.945
you're never gonna find out
who wrote it.

13:45.981 --> 13:47.526
Then instead of starting
with the person

13:47.567 --> 13:49.300
who gave it to the paper,

13:49.402 --> 13:51.916
we're gonna start
with the person they gave it to.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.344
- Louis, hey.
- Don't "hey" me.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.996
I want to know why I went
down to the bullpen

14:01.032 --> 14:03.513
and I was told by own associates
that they can't get to my case

14:03.549 --> 14:06.098
because every one of them
is busy working for you.

14:06.134 --> 14:08.405
Because Eli Gould
is coming after Pfizer.

14:09.063 --> 14:10.137
Shit, that's
your biggest client.

14:10.173 --> 14:11.342
- I know.
- When'd you figure that out?

14:11.378 --> 14:12.946
Last night when I saw this.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.236
If I'm reading this right,

14:16.272 --> 14:18.101
you have about 36 hours
till they go to the board.

14:18.137 --> 14:20.552
48. I filed my first suit
this morning and gave Eli

14:20.613 --> 14:22.067
a song and dance
about the FTC,

14:22.118 --> 14:25.223
but he's no fool, and all
that does is buy us time.

14:25.259 --> 14:26.765
Well, then you take all
the associates you need,

14:26.801 --> 14:28.140
'cause we're gonna do
whatever it takes

14:28.176 --> 14:29.274
to protect our client.

14:29.310 --> 14:29.904
We?

14:29.940 --> 14:31.983
Alex, I told you,
you're family,

14:32.019 --> 14:32.688
and there's no way I'm letting

14:32.739 --> 14:35.788
Elias Douchebag Gould
hurt my family.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.516
George Clark? I'm Mike Ross.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.452
Oh, the guy David wrote
that article about.

14:51.488 --> 14:53.654
And I'm the guy that's gonna
sue you for defamation

14:53.706 --> 14:54.610
unless you help us out.

14:54.673 --> 14:55.656
And why would I
help someone out

14:55.731 --> 14:56.475
who's threatening me?

14:56.511 --> 14:58.448
I'm not threatening.
I'm promising.

14:58.484 --> 15:00.376
Because you ran a story
about a memo

15:00.412 --> 15:01.723
that my client supposedly wrote

15:01.759 --> 15:03.577
that you didn't even give her
a chance to refute.

15:03.629 --> 15:05.788
I didn't need to give her
a chance; I had verification.

15:05.824 --> 15:07.019
From who?

15:07.084 --> 15:09.195
That's what this is about.
You want my source.

15:09.231 --> 15:10.182
You're damn right we do.

15:10.218 --> 15:12.326
And you know, I do that,
and I'll never get another one.

15:12.362 --> 15:15.203
And we prove that memo's fake,
you'll be lucky getting a job

15:15.239 --> 15:17.806
doing movie reviews
for "The Potomac News"

15:17.842 --> 15:20.580
because that article doesn't
just imply my client's guilty.

15:20.637 --> 15:22.970
It implies that I buried
the damn thing.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.425
Well, considering the nature
of my source, you probably did.

15:25.468 --> 15:26.366
What did you just say?

15:26.402 --> 15:28.219
I didn't get it
from Elmont Investments.

15:28.255 --> 15:29.567
I got it from somebody
who knows you.

15:29.603 --> 15:32.229
- Bullshit. That's not possible.
- Knows him or works with him?

15:32.276 --> 15:33.360
The person who gave it to me

15:33.396 --> 15:35.505
had a working relationship
with both of you.

15:35.545 --> 15:37.298
As far as I'm concerned,
that's verification,

15:37.352 --> 15:38.233
and if that's not
good enough for you,

15:38.278 --> 15:39.086
then you go ahead and sue me

15:39.130 --> 15:40.855
because that's all
I'm gonna say.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.703
There you are.
Where's the food?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.461
I was thinking we could
go out to dinner

15:53.497 --> 15:54.704
instead of working through.

15:54.740 --> 15:57.404
No. Rachel, we only get
one shot at this.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.871
We need to be ready.
We can't go out.

15:58.907 --> 16:00.479
We're preparing
for this deposition.

16:00.533 --> 16:01.961
And what if I told you
that we don't have to do

16:01.997 --> 16:03.479
a deposition at all?

16:06.697 --> 16:08.467
A settlement offer?
You got to be kidding me.

16:08.540 --> 16:09.683
Dad, the terms are good.

16:09.762 --> 16:10.706
I don't care
how good they are.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.645
Once I get that bastard in the
room, they're gonna get better,

16:13.749 --> 16:15.021
and they only
came to you with this

16:15.085 --> 16:17.502
because they knew
I'd tell them to kiss my ass.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.692
Except they didn't come to me.
I went to them.

16:19.756 --> 16:22.939
What? You goddamn undercut me?

16:22.992 --> 16:26.194
I didn't undercut you.
I negotiated a deal

16:26.231 --> 16:28.770
because I am worried

16:28.806 --> 16:30.851
about what'll happen
if you get in that room.

16:30.918 --> 16:31.948
What did you just say to me?

16:31.984 --> 16:34.182
You couldn't keep it together
with a loan officer.

16:34.218 --> 16:35.582
How's it gonna go
when you're face-to-face

16:35.634 --> 16:36.884
with the man
that hurt your sister?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.869
I'll tell you how. I'm gonna
crack that man wide open.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.172
Or you'll lose your shit
and we'll get nothing.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.750
Oh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

16:46.535 --> 16:51.229
Dad, I once convinced a man
to put his life on the line

16:51.343 --> 16:55.239
instead of taking an offer
because I believed we could win,

16:55.308 --> 16:58.643
and I'm telling you,
I don't think we can.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.794
Rachel, I took the coward's
way out once before.

17:03.862 --> 17:06.510
I can't do it again,
and I'd rather take my shot

17:06.546 --> 17:09.179
and go down swinging
than walk away from the ring.

17:10.126 --> 17:12.092
Okay.

17:12.127 --> 17:13.839
Then we'll do it your way.

17:15.196 --> 17:17.330
But on one condition.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.333
You're not taking the shot.

17:19.392 --> 17:20.512
I am.

17:27.104 --> 17:28.683
Donna, hey, how'd it go
in court?

17:28.719 --> 17:31.053
I would have asked you earlier,
but I had a ton of doc review.

17:31.478 --> 17:33.831
I really don't want to talk
about it right now, Louis.

17:34.579 --> 17:36.187
Okay. What happened?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.603
Because obviously
something's wrong,

17:37.639 --> 17:39.019
and I'm your friend,
so I'm here for you.

17:39.085 --> 17:41.219
- Bullshit you're here for me.
- What?

17:41.859 --> 17:44.838
I asked you to protect me, but
all you did was protect yourself

17:44.918 --> 17:46.250
because you didn't want
to ask me

17:46.286 --> 17:47.979
the same kinds of questions
that Malik did.

17:48.015 --> 17:49.113
What do you mean
that Malik did?

17:49.149 --> 17:50.060
All Mike needed to do was...

17:50.101 --> 17:51.486
He didn't ask me
about Clifford Danner.

17:51.532 --> 17:53.178
He asked me
about Coastal Motors.

17:53.225 --> 17:55.140
- Oh, my God, the memo.
- Yeah, the memo.

17:55.176 --> 17:56.479
And then he put me
on that stand,

17:56.515 --> 17:58.594
and he came after me
just like I was afraid he would.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.947
Donna, there was no way
we could have seen that coming.

18:01.018 --> 18:03.788
What we could have seen coming
was, if he got me up there,

18:03.826 --> 18:06.994
he would twist the facts,
and he would imply ugly things.

18:07.030 --> 18:09.162
- About you and Harvey?
- Yes, about me and Harvey,

18:09.216 --> 18:10.578
'cause it's always
about me and Harvey.

18:10.617 --> 18:12.157
Last time, this time...

18:12.193 --> 18:13.762
- Donna...
- God damn it, Louis,

18:13.798 --> 18:16.932
I begged you to help me.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.858
I even asked, "What if
your plan doesn't work?"

18:18.893 --> 18:21.827
but you didn't listen,
so Malik rattled me,

18:21.941 --> 18:23.249
and he humiliated me.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.255
And he said I am only COO

18:25.291 --> 18:27.803
because I slept my way there,

18:27.883 --> 18:29.182
and he made it sound plausible,

18:29.218 --> 18:31.178
so now that's on the record
thanks to you.

18:31.246 --> 18:33.383
Me? Harvey signed off on this
just as much as I did.

18:33.419 --> 18:35.952
I really don't care
what Harvey did, Louis,

18:36.004 --> 18:39.881
because I came to you for help,
and you left me high and dry.

18:48.492 --> 18:49.932
Louis, forgive me,

18:49.968 --> 18:52.510
but I don't understand
what you're so upset about.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.270
I'm upset because
Donna laid into me

18:54.306 --> 18:56.260
like the whole thing
was my fault.

18:56.296 --> 18:59.083
Louis, don't you see
she was just venting?

18:59.119 --> 19:00.266
I don't care.

19:00.302 --> 19:02.497
I gave them a foolproof way
to get her out of testifying

19:02.533 --> 19:04.193
and they dropped the ball,
not me.

19:04.229 --> 19:06.744
If that's true,
this shouldn't be

19:06.820 --> 19:08.786
affecting you so much.

19:08.994 --> 19:11.077
So there has to be
an explanation

19:11.133 --> 19:12.862
as to why you're so upset,

19:12.921 --> 19:16.856
and perhaps it has to do
with you not going through

19:16.946 --> 19:18.591
with the mock trial
like you promised you would.

19:18.627 --> 19:21.309
This is about her,
not me.

19:21.406 --> 19:24.137
You don't think
that questioning someone

19:24.205 --> 19:26.100
about their intimate relations

19:26.136 --> 19:29.102
when you're feeling shame about
your own might touch a nerve?

19:29.138 --> 19:30.162
I don't believe this.

19:30.198 --> 19:31.649
You're saying
this is about Sheila?

19:31.685 --> 19:33.103
I'm positing it might be.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.739
Well, I'm positing
what touches a nerve

19:34.775 --> 19:35.785
is that I come to you for help,

19:35.840 --> 19:37.784
and you're saying
this is all my fault.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.962
I'm not saying
it's your fault, Louis,

19:40.067 --> 19:41.305
and I'm trying to help you.

19:41.341 --> 19:42.976
Bullshit.

19:43.065 --> 19:47.541
Louis, you know I would do
anything I could to help you.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.348
Well, you're not,
and instead of waiting for you

19:49.384 --> 19:50.695
to tell me that my time is up,

19:50.731 --> 19:52.596
I'm gonna go ahead
and protect myself

19:52.632 --> 19:54.027
and get the hell out of here.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.653
Okay, if they know us,
that narrows it down.

20:03.689 --> 20:05.359
Yeah, to 1,000
or 2,000 people.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.843
1,000 or 2,000 people
didn't used to work for us.

20:07.879 --> 20:09.669
You know what?
This doesn't make any sense.

20:09.770 --> 20:12.120
We've just had this case
for a week.

20:12.156 --> 20:14.576
By that logic, it would have to
be someone who works here now.

20:14.638 --> 20:17.171
Or it could be someone who
works here from time to time.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.234
What are you
getting at, Donna?

20:18.270 --> 20:20.799
- I'm getting at Holly Cromwell.
- Why would he go to Holly?

20:20.835 --> 20:24.034
Because that reporter would
believe that she has access.

20:24.070 --> 20:25.560
If Malik needed to enlist
someone to do

20:25.616 --> 20:27.991
something like this,
who better to do it?

20:28.053 --> 20:30.281
And on top of that,
she has no love for any of us.

20:30.349 --> 20:32.442
If what you're saying is true,
Malik just went from

20:32.478 --> 20:34.711
strong-arming someone
to fabricating evidence.

20:34.747 --> 20:36.099
No, he didn't.

20:37.768 --> 20:39.709
Jesus Christ,
this guy's good.

20:39.775 --> 20:40.349
What are you saying?

20:40.385 --> 20:42.235
All he did was give
a story to a reporter.

20:42.271 --> 20:43.755
That's... that's not
fabricating evidence.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.046
That's not even a crime.

20:45.082 --> 20:47.697
Well, he admitted it at trial
knowing it was false,

20:47.733 --> 20:48.751
and that sure as hell is.

20:48.787 --> 20:50.491
Harvey, he didn't admit
anything.

20:50.527 --> 20:53.317
We did, because he baited us
into doing it.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.487
He held up the newspaper
as if he was about to enter it,

20:55.523 --> 20:56.559
but then he said "document"

20:56.595 --> 20:58.596
and held up a folder
with the other hand.

20:59.527 --> 21:01.079
Donna, we need a transcript

21:01.165 --> 21:02.497
to make sure
what Mike's saying is true.

21:02.587 --> 21:03.716
I don't need
a transcript, Harvey.

21:03.778 --> 21:04.541
I've got it all right here.

21:04.577 --> 21:06.280
I'm telling you,
you entered that article.

21:06.316 --> 21:08.009
Well, it may not be a crime,

21:08.045 --> 21:09.846
but if Holly comes forward,
he's gonna lose,

21:09.882 --> 21:11.317
which means I'm going
over there right now.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.526
- No, Harvey, I am.
- Donna, you were the one

21:13.562 --> 21:15.431
who made her refuse to come here
in the first place.

21:15.493 --> 21:16.339
She'll never listen to you.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.261
Harvey, that son
of a bitch humiliated me

21:18.323 --> 21:20.136
and told the world
I don't deserve my job.

21:20.172 --> 21:21.639
I don't want to just
prove him wrong.

21:21.675 --> 21:24.245
I want to make him regret
he ever met me.

21:32.114 --> 21:35.922
- Ready for your deposition?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

21:35.970 --> 21:38.303
It's a good plan, Rachel.
It should work.

21:38.488 --> 21:39.913
Do you want to head
up there with me?

21:39.983 --> 21:41.143
I can drop you off on the way.

21:41.179 --> 21:42.260
No, no, you go ahead.

21:42.296 --> 21:45.064
I got something I want to take
care of before I head in.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.416
- Malik case?
- Actually, Paula Agard.

21:49.549 --> 21:51.119
Yeah, she called
about a half hour ago.

21:51.155 --> 21:53.122
She wants to get Harvey
something special,

21:53.204 --> 21:55.168
wanted to know
if I had any ideas.

21:55.204 --> 21:56.990
- Why did she call you?
- I don't know.

21:57.026 --> 21:59.341
I guess maybe she thinks
that I'm Harvey's best friend.

21:59.377 --> 22:01.643
Or maybe because the person
that knows Harvey the best

22:01.726 --> 22:04.367
is the only person
she'll never call.

22:05.235 --> 22:09.462
Okay. Got something
on your mind?

22:09.557 --> 22:11.709
It's just,
Donna was here the other night,

22:11.771 --> 22:15.378
and she told me about
this guy from years ago and...

22:15.876 --> 22:18.354
she chose Harvey over him,

22:19.024 --> 22:23.955
and I asked her
if she regretted it, and...

22:23.991 --> 22:26.050
- And what?
- I guess it just made me wonder

22:26.086 --> 22:28.186
if what she really regrets

22:28.222 --> 22:31.569
is never telling Harvey
how she feels.

22:33.214 --> 22:35.885
Anyway, I've got to get going.

22:41.416 --> 22:43.917
- Louis, we have a problem.
- What is it now?

22:43.992 --> 22:46.545
I threw everything in the book
at Gould. None of it worked.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.326
On top of that, they just
moved up the timeline.

22:48.362 --> 22:49.467
Then you're gonna need
to contact the board

22:49.509 --> 22:50.416
about a corporate amendment.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.472
Louis, I'm telling you
we've looked at everything:

22:52.562 --> 22:54.940
supermajority,
golden parachute, poison pill.

22:54.976 --> 22:56.736
What about the crown jewels?
You go through their divisions,

22:56.774 --> 22:57.847
and you find the one
that's most valuable.

22:57.883 --> 22:59.992
I know what the crown jewel
defense is, Louis.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.660
The problem is, even if I could
find a buyer and agree to terms,

23:02.696 --> 23:04.555
there's no way we could
push it through in time.

23:06.295 --> 23:09.320
Wait a second. We don't need
to push it through in time.

23:09.356 --> 23:10.577
We just need to make them
think we did.

23:10.613 --> 23:12.717
Are you crazy?
A bluff is never gonna work.

23:12.753 --> 23:14.412
They know every legitimate buyer
in the country.

23:14.448 --> 23:16.602
I am not talking about
a legitimate buyer,

23:16.638 --> 23:17.924
and I am definitely
not talking about them

23:17.960 --> 23:19.563
being from this country.

23:26.756 --> 23:28.683
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to apologize

23:28.719 --> 23:30.278
for what happened
the last time we met.

23:30.343 --> 23:31.787
You're here
because you want something.

23:31.823 --> 23:34.718
You're right. I do, but please
just hear what I have to say.

23:34.754 --> 23:35.968
You have 30 seconds.

23:36.004 --> 23:38.400
You told me that you find out
what makes people tick

23:38.436 --> 23:39.962
and you use that
to get what you want

23:40.017 --> 23:43.528
and it works because people
don't see the bigger picture.

23:43.564 --> 23:44.893
- That's right.
- What you didn't tell me

23:44.952 --> 23:46.210
was that you learned
how to do that

23:46.267 --> 23:48.899
because your stepfather's
an alcoholic,

23:49.027 --> 23:50.205
so you learned to read people

23:50.241 --> 23:53.465
and be who they want you
to be to protect yourself.

23:54.672 --> 23:56.648
That's not something
to judge you for.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.958
Okay. I accept your apology,

24:02.020 --> 24:04.466
but I can't do
what you're here to ask.

24:04.527 --> 24:05.790
He has something on you,
doesn't he?

24:05.855 --> 24:08.574
I haven't exactly led
a crime-free life, Donna.

24:08.630 --> 24:09.453
Now, if you will excuse me...

24:09.489 --> 24:11.612
We can defend you against
anything he has on you.

24:11.648 --> 24:13.823
I can't risk that.
Because given the history

24:13.904 --> 24:16.005
you just admitted
you judged me for,

24:16.211 --> 24:19.252
if I ever stand in front
of a jury with women on it...

24:19.288 --> 24:22.815
Holly, please.
We need this.

24:25.071 --> 24:26.633
I'm sorry, Donna.

24:27.476 --> 24:31.581
If I could help you,
I would, but I can't.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.836
Mr. Kittredge, 90%
of your executives are male.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.336
- Is that correct?
- I wouldn't know.

24:41.390 --> 24:42.298
I evaluate my employees

24:42.385 --> 24:44.674
based on their work
and not their gender.

24:44.710 --> 24:46.320
And what about the color
of their skin?

24:46.356 --> 24:48.783
I believe you had a meeting
with Lisa Davies.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.883
She's one of our
senior loan officers.

24:50.919 --> 24:53.215
You mean the woman of color
you sent in to hide your crime?

24:53.251 --> 24:54.661
What is this?
I thought I was here

24:54.697 --> 24:56.804
to answer some questions
about our loan process.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.606
And I'll get to that,
but first I would like

24:58.642 --> 25:00.875
to ask you about Alicia Taylor.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.209
- Who?
- The woman that you fired

25:02.271 --> 25:03.206
because she wouldn't
sleep with you.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.494
You did do that, didn't you?

25:04.530 --> 25:06.474
Alicia Taylor has no bearing
on this case.

25:06.510 --> 25:08.795
She's everything that's wrong
with this case.

25:08.831 --> 25:10.412
I'm sorry.
Is there a question?

25:10.448 --> 25:12.249
Yes.

25:12.285 --> 25:14.485
Do attractive women
intimidate you, Arthur?

25:14.564 --> 25:15.704
No, why would they?

25:15.744 --> 25:17.668
Because they're strong
and they're powerful

25:17.758 --> 25:19.057
and they know
what they want.

25:19.093 --> 25:22.513
I value my female employees
like anyone,

25:22.583 --> 25:24.028
and you have no proof
otherwise.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.996
Then answer the question
or take the fifth.

25:26.032 --> 25:27.775
Have you ever tried
to sleep with someone

25:27.811 --> 25:30.410
and then retaliated
once they rejected you?

25:30.790 --> 25:33.867
The answer is no.
I haven't.

25:34.705 --> 25:37.638
Of course, things are different
for women who don't work for me.

25:37.713 --> 25:38.983
I'd ask you out in a second.

25:39.019 --> 25:40.676
- Watch yourself.
- Dad, I've got this.

25:40.712 --> 25:42.478
It's all right.
I know where he's coming from.

25:42.552 --> 25:45.353
I mean, after all, he's your
father, but he's not blind.

25:45.389 --> 25:46.909
I mean, he knows
you're attractive.

25:46.945 --> 25:48.029
- Arthur.
- As a matter of fact,

25:48.066 --> 25:49.246
if it were up to me,
I'd be willing

25:49.282 --> 25:51.533
to settle this for one date,
maybe two.

25:51.569 --> 25:52.492
All right, that's enough.

25:52.528 --> 25:54.229
You see,
that is the irony here.

25:54.265 --> 25:56.249
I am being accused
of discriminating

25:56.285 --> 25:57.622
against people of color

25:57.658 --> 26:01.498
when in fact I have always
preferred women of color.

26:01.639 --> 26:02.700
There's just something
about them.

26:02.736 --> 26:04.736
You know, they're exotic.

26:04.801 --> 26:06.994
- Like you, Ms. Zane...
- You son of a bitch,

26:07.030 --> 26:08.698
I'm gonna make sure you're
the one that loses everything

26:08.759 --> 26:10.294
and not the people
that you prey upon.

26:10.344 --> 26:10.863
- Dad.
- You mean

26:10.899 --> 26:11.716
people like your sister?

26:11.752 --> 26:13.433
- You're goddamn right I do!
- Dad.

26:13.469 --> 26:15.856
My sister meant everything
to me, and you stole her light,

26:15.892 --> 26:17.506
and I'm gonna make sure
that you pay for it

26:17.542 --> 26:19.273
if it's the last thing I do.

26:19.309 --> 26:21.283
Well, I'm afraid it's not
gonna be with this suit

26:21.319 --> 26:23.014
because you just admitted
it's nothing more

26:23.050 --> 26:25.712
than a trumped-up vendetta,
and we have it on record.

26:25.956 --> 26:28.637
Took me a while to remember,
but once I did,

26:28.673 --> 26:31.109
I knew exactly
how to take care of you.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.443
What did she say?

26:41.479 --> 26:43.532
That she was the source.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.174
But let me guess,
she won't testify.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.943
No, she won't, but I will.

26:47.979 --> 26:48.514
Donna...

26:48.550 --> 26:50.093
She admitted
that he contacted her.

26:50.149 --> 26:51.183
That's what you said we needed.

26:51.219 --> 26:53.247
I said I needed her
to say it, not you.

26:53.304 --> 26:54.361
Well, why can't it be me?

26:54.397 --> 26:55.703
My word is as good as hers.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.172
- It doesn't matter.
- Why not?

26:57.208 --> 27:01.834
Because in this situation,
it isn't.

27:01.940 --> 27:04.029
You mean the situation
where he made it look like

27:04.085 --> 27:05.214
I would do anything
for you because I...

27:05.250 --> 27:07.317
I don't care what
he made it look like.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.013
It's not true.

27:12.620 --> 27:16.059
I wanted to get back at him
so badly.

27:17.882 --> 27:19.751
And I wanted to be
the one to do it.

27:23.324 --> 27:26.662
- You were the one to do it.
- How?

27:26.731 --> 27:29.112
You realized it was Holly,
and the truth is,

27:29.164 --> 27:32.032
she was never gonna say yes
no matter who asked.

27:32.716 --> 27:33.913
So what are we gonna do?

27:33.949 --> 27:35.887
Mike and I are gonna use
what you gave us

27:35.923 --> 27:37.924
to put a gun
to Andrew Malik's head,

27:37.986 --> 27:39.597
and if we do it right,

27:39.633 --> 27:42.203
he is gonna regret
the day he met you.

27:48.316 --> 27:51.284
Okay, I'll call you
in the morning, Mom.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.223
Try to get some sleep.

27:55.959 --> 27:58.496
Robert, what's wrong?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.609
Jasmine died two hours ago.

28:03.460 --> 28:06.163
Oh, Robert, I'm so sorry.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.072
I could have helped her.

28:12.170 --> 28:13.064
I should have helped her.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.732
- No, don't do that to yourself.
- Do what?

28:16.039 --> 28:17.442
Face the truth?

28:20.189 --> 28:25.624
That man ruined her life,
and I did nothing.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.964
You were there for her
in every way possible

28:28.000 --> 28:30.067
for the last two years.

28:30.103 --> 28:33.398
She didn't die from that.
She died 'cause she got sick.

28:33.434 --> 28:36.682
But I wasn't there
the one time she had asked,

28:38.710 --> 28:40.927
and maybe if I was...

28:41.002 --> 28:43.158
I finished my homework!

28:46.438 --> 28:50.343
Daddy, are you okay?

28:51.761 --> 28:53.528
Daddy got some bad news,
sweetheart,

28:53.564 --> 28:55.629
so why don't we
give him a minute?

29:12.527 --> 29:14.713
I keep catching you
lost in thought.

29:16.247 --> 29:19.017
I keep thinking
about this goddamn case.

29:19.821 --> 29:21.286
So was I.

29:21.322 --> 29:22.481
Well, I hope you got something

29:22.541 --> 29:25.145
'cause I really shit
the bed in there,

29:25.181 --> 29:26.830
just like you were afraid
I would.

29:26.866 --> 29:27.435
Dad...

29:27.471 --> 29:28.828
We should have taken
that deal, Rachel.

29:28.864 --> 29:30.071
You were right.

29:31.694 --> 29:33.670
Maybe not.

29:33.743 --> 29:36.681
In fact, maybe you should
have that one-on-one

29:36.717 --> 29:38.851
with Kittredge after all.

29:39.079 --> 29:40.049
What are you getting at?

29:40.085 --> 29:42.486
I was thinking he used
your weakness against us,

29:42.522 --> 29:44.516
so why don't we use
his weakness against him?

29:44.558 --> 29:46.487
Isn't that what we tried to do
with that deposition?

29:46.528 --> 29:49.628
Yeah, but like you used
to yell at the TV on Sundays,

29:49.681 --> 29:52.449
if running it up the middle
isn't working,

29:52.485 --> 29:56.943
then do us all a goddamn favor
and call an end-around.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.789
You were really listening
to all those games, weren't you?

29:59.825 --> 30:01.964
Not the games, Dad.

30:02.054 --> 30:04.091
I was listening to you.

30:10.571 --> 30:12.103
Mike, what are you doing here?

30:12.171 --> 30:14.071
I thought you and Harvey
were going to see Malik.

30:14.107 --> 30:17.179
We are, just not
for another hour.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.204
Just wanted to talk to you
about something.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.230
- What is it?
- Donna, Rachel told me

30:22.266 --> 30:24.171
that when I moved out
because of Logan Sanders,

30:24.207 --> 30:26.251
you told her to give me
some space

30:26.287 --> 30:31.089
because things work out the way
that they're supposed to.

30:31.169 --> 30:34.054
- But she didn't do that.
- Well, that's my point.

30:34.090 --> 30:35.344
Mike, where are you
going with this?

30:35.380 --> 30:37.078
Tell Harvey how you feel.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.491
What?

30:39.554 --> 30:42.988
I know that it's not my place
to say this, but, Donna,

30:43.103 --> 30:45.938
I wouldn't be with Rachel
if it wasn't for you,

30:46.006 --> 30:48.110
and if I let you lose something
that might make you

30:48.169 --> 30:49.459
as happy as we are

30:49.526 --> 30:52.430
and I didn't say something,
I would never forgive myself.

30:55.196 --> 30:57.627
So if you think there is even
the smallest chance

30:57.663 --> 30:59.283
that you might ever
want to be together

30:59.319 --> 31:02.480
and you don't tell him
that soon,

31:02.516 --> 31:04.853
you might lose the chance
to tell him at all.

31:06.761 --> 31:09.794
Mike...

31:10.003 --> 31:13.257
I appreciate
where your heart is,

31:13.319 --> 31:16.772
but two people have to want
to be together to be happy,

31:16.808 --> 31:20.065
and Harvey and I don't
want to be together.

31:20.135 --> 31:21.602
Are you sure?

31:22.761 --> 31:24.153
I'm sure.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.663
- You want me to do what?
- <i>You said before that</i>

31:28.699 --> 31:31.018
<i>you would do anything
in your power to help me.</i>

31:31.056 --> 31:32.236
Well, now I'm asking.

31:32.272 --> 31:34.928
<i>Louis, I meant in this
office, and you know it.</i>

31:35.000 --> 31:37.016
You're asking me to pretend
to be someone I'm not,

31:37.052 --> 31:38.868
which is a violation
of my license.

31:38.904 --> 31:40.625
<i>Not according to
Munley v. Marowan, it's not.</i>

31:40.661 --> 31:41.637
<i>I don't know what that is.</i>

31:41.673 --> 31:43.819
Well, that's 'cause you're
a psychiatrist and not a lawyer,

31:43.855 --> 31:45.611
but what I need you to be

31:45.647 --> 31:47.676
is the head of a German
pharmaceutical company.

31:47.712 --> 31:49.289
- Louis!
- <i>Stan, please.</i>

31:49.325 --> 31:51.598
I already let Donna down,

31:51.663 --> 31:53.594
and I can't do anything
to help that,

31:53.640 --> 31:55.355
<i>and if I let someone down
that I care about</i>

31:55.429 --> 31:59.031
<i>twice in two days,
what kind of partner am I?</i>

31:59.984 --> 32:02.058
More importantly,
what kind of friend?

32:09.575 --> 32:11.972
Louis, I'm sorry.

32:12.008 --> 32:14.374
<i>Violation of my license
or not,</i>

32:14.510 --> 32:16.409
<i>what you're asking me to do
is unethical,</i>

32:16.445 --> 32:18.281
and I won't do it.

32:22.932 --> 32:23.954
Well?

32:26.317 --> 32:28.855
I'm sorry, Alex.
He said no.

32:34.763 --> 32:36.438
Well,
did you come to cut a deal?

32:36.474 --> 32:38.148
'Cause I'm all ears
as long as it includes

32:38.184 --> 32:39.830
an admission
that you lost and I won.

32:39.866 --> 32:41.637
Oh, we're here to talk
about an admission,

32:41.673 --> 32:42.745
but not the kind you think.

32:42.781 --> 32:43.958
Yeah, we're here to discuss
an admission

32:43.994 --> 32:47.815
of fabricated evidence
into court by you.

32:47.916 --> 32:48.970
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:49.006 --> 32:49.834
I did no such thing.

32:49.888 --> 32:51.147
We know you didn't
do it yourself.

32:51.183 --> 32:52.586
You had two idiots
do it for you.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.891
If it's all the same
to you, Harvey,

32:53.927 --> 32:55.882
I actually don't consider
myself an idiot.

32:55.918 --> 32:58.102
Ah, you have a point.
You were the one who figured out

32:58.138 --> 33:00.732
he baited us into entering
that newspaper for him.

33:00.768 --> 33:02.780
But, to be fair, though,
it was Donna who figured out

33:02.835 --> 33:04.557
that he went to Holly Cromwell

33:04.593 --> 33:06.851
because it gave
the whole thing credibility.

33:06.887 --> 33:08.532
It's not a crime to give
someone a piece of paper

33:08.568 --> 33:10.154
and have them drop it off
at an address.

33:10.190 --> 33:12.838
But it is a crime
to lie about it under oath,

33:12.874 --> 33:15.974
and I'm gonna put you
on that stand.

33:16.010 --> 33:17.744
You can't force me
to testify in my own case.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.095
I'm afraid you opened
the door to that one

33:19.163 --> 33:20.534
when you made
Harvey's character an issue,

33:20.595 --> 33:23.434
because if his character's
at issue, then why isn't yours?

33:23.470 --> 33:24.812
Look, I broke no laws,

33:24.886 --> 33:26.548
and we all know that
Janet Stanger is guilty.

33:26.584 --> 33:29.404
And if she's guilty and you're
as good as you think you are,

33:29.472 --> 33:30.628
you should have
gotten her convicted

33:30.708 --> 33:32.674
without planting that bullshit.

33:32.743 --> 33:33.925
So which is it, Andy:

33:33.961 --> 33:35.578
do you want to be
humiliated on the stand,

33:35.669 --> 33:37.643
or do you want to drop
this case right now,

33:37.679 --> 33:40.873
you evidence-manufacturing
piece of shit?

33:47.165 --> 33:51.449
Arthur, I appreciate you
meeting me on such short notice.

33:51.485 --> 33:53.322
And I appreciate
the opportunity

33:53.358 --> 33:55.023
to have somebody
grovel at my feet.

33:55.059 --> 33:57.092
Look, I know
the position we're in.

33:57.128 --> 33:59.294
The fact is, the judge hasn't
ruled on your motion yet, and...

33:59.330 --> 34:00.755
You want a settlement.

34:00.791 --> 34:01.688
I'm just talking
about something

34:01.724 --> 34:04.186
that allows me to save face
with my clients.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.310
As I said, I appreciate
the opportunity

34:07.346 --> 34:09.783
to have someone
grovel at my feet.

34:14.659 --> 34:16.159
What the hell is this?

34:16.195 --> 34:17.420
That's what you're
going to pay us.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.534
This is three times
what it was before.

34:19.570 --> 34:21.940
I know, because as of now,
you've been notified

34:21.976 --> 34:23.193
of Arthur Kittredge's behavior,

34:23.264 --> 34:24.929
which means the next time
it happens,

34:24.981 --> 34:26.368
you're all personally liable.

34:26.404 --> 34:28.391
A man who did this once
is gonna do it again.

34:28.447 --> 34:30.268
You son of a bitch,
this is not gonna work.

34:30.304 --> 34:32.292
Oh, I beg to differ because
I don't know if you noticed,

34:32.328 --> 34:34.184
but it's just me here today.

34:34.274 --> 34:34.826
So what?

34:34.869 --> 34:36.635
So while we're here,
my daughter, the woman

34:36.741 --> 34:38.429
you wouldn't think could
hold her own in a boardroom,

34:38.465 --> 34:40.567
she's with your board right now

34:40.626 --> 34:42.495
explaining how you're
not worth it anymore.

34:42.531 --> 34:45.513
Because in case you haven't
been in a courtroom recently,

34:45.549 --> 34:48.168
most juries aren't made up
of rich, old white men.

34:48.204 --> 34:49.520
- Bullshit.
- You're bluffing.

34:49.556 --> 34:51.632
It's not bullshit.
We got to them before you did

34:51.668 --> 34:52.978
with
a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

34:53.034 --> 34:53.683
The choice is yours.

34:53.739 --> 34:56.398
You take the settlement
and you remove your CEO...

34:56.434 --> 34:58.526
Or you could roll the dice
with a jury not of your peers.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.380
Either way, you are done.

35:20.747 --> 35:23.066
Harvey, hey,
what's going on?

35:23.136 --> 35:25.838
Don't tell me that Malik tried
to weasel out of that agreement.

35:25.911 --> 35:29.212
No, it's all good.
I just wanted to stop by and say

35:29.271 --> 35:32.238
thank you for bringing me
this case in the first place.

35:32.274 --> 35:34.573
Does that mean we're even
for the prison thing?

35:34.821 --> 35:36.470
We're even.

35:36.506 --> 35:38.925
Thanks, Mike.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.044
Harvey...

35:41.861 --> 35:44.229
did you talk to Donna
since last night?

35:44.265 --> 35:47.131
No, other than
to text her we won. Why?

35:47.360 --> 35:49.280
- Nothing.
- Don't worry, Mike.

35:49.316 --> 35:50.813
I know she's had a rough time.

35:50.894 --> 35:52.168
I'll tell her
we stuck it to Malik

35:52.204 --> 35:54.074
and we couldn't have
done it without her.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.743
I was hoping
you'd still be here.

36:03.927 --> 36:05.417
What do you want, Alex?

36:05.453 --> 36:08.821
To give you what you wanted
all along,

36:08.857 --> 36:10.893
me on my knees begging.

36:12.476 --> 36:15.144
- I'm listening.
- You won, Eli.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.077
I can't stop you
from taking Pfizer,

36:17.113 --> 36:20.981
but this wasn't about them or
Tommy Bratton or anything else.

36:21.017 --> 36:23.582
This was about me leaving,

36:23.651 --> 36:25.385
and now I'm asking
what it will take

36:25.452 --> 36:27.321
to get you to back off my firm.

36:32.974 --> 36:35.440
Okay, then...

36:35.492 --> 36:37.576
Pearson Specter
can keep Pfizer,

36:37.612 --> 36:39.110
and all you have to do
is come back here

36:39.146 --> 36:41.471
with every
other client you have.

36:42.897 --> 36:45.997
That's what you wanted
all along, isn't it?

36:46.065 --> 36:48.753
You had your client go after
mine to put me in the position

36:48.789 --> 36:50.289
of having to screw Harvey over.

36:50.364 --> 36:51.006
That's right.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.096
That agreement may have
stopped me from poaching,

36:54.132 --> 36:55.863
but there's always
a workaround.

36:55.935 --> 36:58.912
So which is it,
stay there a diminished man

36:58.966 --> 37:00.398
without your best client

37:00.434 --> 37:03.605
or come back here
where you belong?

37:05.948 --> 37:07.580
You know what, Eli?

37:07.897 --> 37:10.683
I think I'm gonna stay
exactly where I am,

37:10.719 --> 37:12.236
at Pearson Specter Litt,

37:12.272 --> 37:14.012
with every damn one
of my clients.

37:14.048 --> 37:15.626
- Excuse me?
- You just admitted

37:15.662 --> 37:17.763
that you orchestrated
a takeover attempt

37:17.799 --> 37:19.849
for the sole purpose
of breaching our agreement.

37:19.885 --> 37:21.640
You son of a bitch.

37:22.344 --> 37:24.218
- You set me up!
- That's right.

37:24.254 --> 37:26.584
You had us, Eli,
and now you don't,

37:26.663 --> 37:30.201
because like you said,
there's always a workaround.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.118
Let me guess.

37:33.155 --> 37:35.634
The price for you not handing
that over is that I owe you one.

37:35.704 --> 37:37.702
Well, look who's
on their knees now.

37:37.765 --> 37:39.193
Good night, Eli.

37:39.338 --> 37:41.274
I'll be in touch
when I need you.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.779
- Did it work?
- Like a charm.

37:53.828 --> 37:55.395
Oh, thank God.
I couldn't stand the thought

37:55.471 --> 37:57.228
of letting down
another person in the office.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.280
Louis, from what I've seen,

37:59.414 --> 38:02.215
you've never let anyone
in this firm down.

38:02.251 --> 38:03.954
Well, I did.

38:06.345 --> 38:08.282
And it's time
I made it right.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.803
What are you doing here, Andy?

38:14.839 --> 38:18.020
I came here to tell you
that you may have won the case,

38:18.056 --> 38:20.095
but I still wanted
to get back at you,

38:20.131 --> 38:22.212
so I decided to come
after your old mentor.

38:22.248 --> 38:23.653
If you think Cameron Dennis

38:23.689 --> 38:25.269
can't handle
whatever you throw at him,

38:25.305 --> 38:26.538
you got another thing coming.

38:26.574 --> 38:28.453
I'm not talking
about Cameron Dennis.

38:28.521 --> 38:32.649
I'm talking about your
other mentor, Jessica Pearson.

38:32.736 --> 38:34.162
- What did you do?
- I didn't do it.

38:34.198 --> 38:35.599
You did, when you let her
take the bullet

38:35.635 --> 38:37.871
for you with Mike Ross.

38:40.157 --> 38:42.190
Andrew, this is between
you and me, not Jessica.

38:42.226 --> 38:44.023
Wow, look at that.
Andrew, huh?

38:44.059 --> 38:46.604
Not Malik or Andy, Andrew.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.868
Listen to me, what she did for
Mike Ross doesn't involve you.

38:50.904 --> 38:53.189
Oh, it involves me because
she admitted to being a party

38:53.225 --> 38:55.027
to fraud in front
of the New York State Bar.

38:55.063 --> 38:56.749
Funny thing is,
no one seemed to care.

38:56.785 --> 39:00.024
Well, I did, so I whipped up
a motion to have her disbarred,

39:00.060 --> 39:00.858
and when a motion like that

39:00.894 --> 39:02.107
comes from
the Attorney General's Office,

39:02.143 --> 39:04.257
man, it is amazing
how much people start to care.

39:04.293 --> 39:06.426
- You son of a bitch.
- Ah, there it is.

39:06.462 --> 39:08.655
That's the look
I came here to see.

39:08.691 --> 39:10.391
The only thing better would be
if I could be there

39:10.427 --> 39:11.670
when you have to tell
Jessica Pearson

39:11.706 --> 39:14.242
that you cost her
her license to practice law.

39:15.435 --> 39:17.837
Have a nice evening, Harvey.

39:20.499 --> 39:21.676
Louis,
pick up the phone.

39:21.712 --> 39:23.825
This is the third time
I've called.

39:23.861 --> 39:26.294
We need to get to anyone
we know at the New York Bar

39:26.330 --> 39:27.988
on the phone tonight.

39:28.024 --> 39:30.400
Andrew Malik's trying
to have Jessica disbarred.

39:30.482 --> 39:32.775
Not trying. He already did.

39:33.817 --> 39:36.277
- Jessica.
- Harvey, put that phone away.

39:36.349 --> 39:39.008
This is happening, and there's
nothing we can do about it.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.648
There's a hell of a lot
we can do about it,

39:40.684 --> 39:41.849
and we're going to.

39:41.885 --> 39:43.990
No, we're not.
Listen to me.

39:44.026 --> 39:47.384
We knew this could happen,
and I said it doesn't matter

39:47.420 --> 39:49.250
because in Chicago,
nobody's going to care.

39:49.286 --> 39:51.146
I don't give a shit
about Chicago. I care.

39:51.207 --> 39:52.333
And it's not your decision.

39:52.395 --> 39:53.975
Jessica, we can't have
a name on the wall

39:54.042 --> 39:55.654
of a partner
that's been disbarred.

39:55.689 --> 39:57.690
What the hell do you think
I'm doing here?

40:01.095 --> 40:03.118
No, I'm not doing it.

40:03.188 --> 40:04.999
Yes, you are.

40:05.285 --> 40:07.536
Harvey, it's time to take
my name off the wall.

40:07.632 --> 40:09.931
Not like this,

40:09.967 --> 40:11.582
not after all
we've been through.

40:11.650 --> 40:14.166
I'm good with this,

40:14.202 --> 40:17.075
and it's not my firm anymore.

40:17.177 --> 40:18.562
It's yours.

40:20.258 --> 40:21.559
I'm not ready.

40:21.595 --> 40:23.209
You've been ready for
the better part of a year,

40:23.245 --> 40:24.291
and you know it,

40:24.327 --> 40:25.235
so the only question is,

40:25.271 --> 40:27.905
are you going to fight me
on this,

40:28.079 --> 40:29.888
or are you gonna accept it?

40:32.629 --> 40:34.260
And what if I say I accept it?

40:34.327 --> 40:36.567
Then you need to go
and talk to Louis

40:36.603 --> 40:40.328
because you've got
two things to figure out:

40:40.364 --> 40:43.530
how much you're gonna
spend to buy me out

40:43.566 --> 40:45.695
and how are you gonna
spin this thing?

41:02.489 --> 41:03.877
Donna, you have a minute?

41:03.913 --> 41:05.513
A minute for what, Louis?

41:05.549 --> 41:07.214
So you can tell me
how it wasn't your fault

41:07.250 --> 41:09.012
that you didn't prepare me
to be on the stand?

41:09.048 --> 41:11.081
A minute to say I'm sorry.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.358
You were right, Donna.

41:14.658 --> 41:16.260
I should have
prepared you for Malik,

41:16.296 --> 41:18.796
but I didn't because

41:18.832 --> 41:21.600
I couldn't bear the thought
of asking you about Harvey

41:21.636 --> 41:23.061
in front of a room
full of people.

41:23.097 --> 41:24.279
Louis, I knew
that would come up.

41:24.348 --> 41:25.298
I was ready to handle it.

41:25.334 --> 41:27.971
But I wasn't,
because of Sheila.

41:28.022 --> 41:28.991
What does Sheila
have to do with...

41:29.027 --> 41:30.746
I slept with her, Donna.

41:30.782 --> 41:33.214
I told you she was
getting married.

41:33.250 --> 41:36.183
When I was writing
down questions,

41:36.311 --> 41:39.168
I kept imagining someone
putting my life on trial,

41:39.204 --> 41:42.410
and I just... I couldn't take it,

41:42.784 --> 41:44.521
so I took the coward's way out,

41:44.590 --> 41:46.400
and I didn't prepare you.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.990
I understand, Louis,

41:51.089 --> 41:53.192
and I accept your apology.

41:54.380 --> 41:55.882
Thank you, Donna.

41:58.265 --> 41:59.863
Louis, what is it?

41:59.899 --> 42:03.200
Ever since I left that
hotel room, I've been stuck.

42:03.236 --> 42:07.272
We were together again, and it
felt just like it did before,

42:07.308 --> 42:11.396
except it wasn't
because she wasn't mine,

42:11.432 --> 42:13.498
and since then,
I've been counting the days

42:13.534 --> 42:17.552
until my soul mate
marries someone else

42:17.588 --> 42:19.649
and walks out
of my life forever.

42:21.574 --> 42:23.071
- Louis...
- I know she's with another man,

42:23.107 --> 42:25.980
Donna, and I know she says
that she loves him,

42:26.026 --> 42:30.249
but all I want to do
is just say to her,

42:30.324 --> 42:34.103
can't she see the man
she was meant to be with

42:34.139 --> 42:36.557
is standing right
in front of her face?

42:38.533 --> 42:39.439
I'm so sorry.

42:39.475 --> 42:42.032
I should have told her
when I had the chance,

42:42.068 --> 42:43.342
but that's something
I'm gonna have to live with

42:43.378 --> 42:45.376
for the rest of my life.

43:00.315 --> 43:02.478
Good, you're still here.
Where's Louis?

43:02.541 --> 43:04.808
'Cause I have some news,
and I think you should both...

43:13.488 --> 43:15.289
I'm sorry, Harvey.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.653
I just had to know.
