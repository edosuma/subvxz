00:01.566 --> 00:01.784
.

00:01.827 --> 00:03.829
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.873 --> 00:05.266
sexually based offenses

00:05.309 --> 00:06.789
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.834
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.878 --> 00:10.662
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.706 --> 00:12.229
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.273 --> 00:14.144
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.188 --> 00:16.799
These are their stories.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.845
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

00:19.889 --> 00:22.718
It's not going through, man!
- You need to make that call!

00:24.459 --> 00:25.808
Malik, come on, man,
that's what I'm saying!

00:27.897 --> 00:29.116
- Hey, man!

00:31.205 --> 00:33.076
- Look at his face!

00:33.120 --> 00:34.251
- You gonna pay
for this?

00:34.295 --> 00:35.861
- Look, man,
it's an accident!

00:38.516 --> 00:40.344
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
he's got a gun, there?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.564
- No!
- I'm calling the police!

00:42.607 --> 00:44.522
- You ain't gonna call
no police, man!

00:44.566 --> 00:45.741
- Jay, Jay, come on.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.222
- Let's go, let's go,
let's go, man!

00:55.577 --> 00:57.666
- Damn!
- Stop right there!

00:57.709 --> 00:59.189
- Put your hands
where we can see them!

00:59.233 --> 01:00.669
- We didn't do anything!
- Shut your mouth,

01:00.712 --> 01:02.192
and keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.759
- They tried to rob me!
- No, we didn't!

01:03.802 --> 01:06.544
- Shut up, shut up.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.198
- I was trying to use
the bodega phone.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.373
I was taking my cell
out the pocket,

01:09.417 --> 01:10.809
just to show him
it was dead!

01:10.853 --> 01:12.333
- Sir, listen to me--

01:12.376 --> 01:13.551
- You listen to me!
You keep your hands

01:13.595 --> 01:15.075
on the hood.
- We need help!

01:15.118 --> 01:17.642
His sister!
She's--she's being raped!

01:17.686 --> 01:19.905
- I was trying to call 911.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.864
My sister--
She's 16, she--

01:21.907 --> 01:23.344
She's in the playground
around the corner, please!

01:23.387 --> 01:25.128
We gotta go get her!

01:25.172 --> 01:27.609
Please, we gotta
go get her!

01:29.698 --> 01:32.135
- How long ago
did the assault happen?

01:32.179 --> 01:33.658
- About an hour.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.225
Guy says, he and his sister
were held up at gunpoint.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.053
- They threw Tiana
to the ground--

01:37.097 --> 01:38.315
- Officer said you ran.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.708
- There were six
of them, sir.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.013
- Over here!

01:41.057 --> 01:42.319
We got her!

01:43.886 --> 01:45.801
She's right here.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.762
Hey, it's okay,

01:50.806 --> 01:52.808
we got you, baby.
Okay, can you sit up?

01:52.851 --> 01:54.810
There you go.
- Somebody call a bus!

01:54.853 --> 01:56.159
- Here you go.
Can you tell us what happened?

01:56.203 --> 01:57.682
- Oh, thank God you're okay, T.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.510
Look, the guys that raped you,
I swear to God,

01:59.554 --> 02:01.382
I swear to God,
I'ma kill 'em, okay?

02:01.425 --> 02:02.426
- Back up!
- I swear to God!

02:02.470 --> 02:03.949
Help me,

02:03.993 --> 02:05.168
I was raped!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.302
I'm sorry, Malik!

02:08.345 --> 02:10.608
- It's okay.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.871
- I'm sorry!

02:22.403 --> 02:29.584
â™ª

03:06.882 --> 03:08.144
- Hey, sorry
for calling so late.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.406
- It's okay.
The victim is 16?

03:09.450 --> 03:11.060
- Yeah.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.236
- Well, the mother is
in Bedford Hills Correctional.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.759
There's no father
in the picture.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.370
Her older brother, Malik,
is her legal guardian.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.372
- Okay, and Malik is the one
who reported the rape?

03:18.415 --> 03:19.808
- Yeah, so he
and his friend, Jerome,

03:19.851 --> 03:21.375
were apparently trying
to call for help,

03:21.418 --> 03:24.552
and the bodega owner
thought it was a robbery.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.249
- So much
for community relations.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.730
And can Malik or his friend
ID the rapist?

03:28.773 --> 03:31.254
- It was dark; they say
that there were six of them,

03:31.298 --> 03:32.734
one of them with a gun.
We're canvassing now.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.779
We're pulling security cams.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.259
You're from SVU?
- We are.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.565
- I just examined
Tiana Williams.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.262
- Scrapes, bruising

03:39.306 --> 03:41.525
on her knees,
palms, genital trauma

03:41.569 --> 03:42.613
on the rape kit.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.180
Semen in her throat
and underwear.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.747
- Okay, well, let's get
that to the lab,

03:45.790 --> 03:47.314
and see if we can get
lucky enough to get a DNA hit.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.359
- She was pretty out of it
when we found her.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.795
What came up
on the tox screen?

03:50.839 --> 03:53.189
- Traces of heroin,
and her blood alcohol

03:53.233 --> 03:55.496
was .19.
- A 16-year-old girl,

03:55.539 --> 03:57.062
alone in the middle
of the night in that kind

03:57.106 --> 03:58.325
of shape.
- You don't wanna know

03:58.368 --> 03:59.630
how many times
we see that in here.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.371
- Okay, so did you
call Child Services?

04:01.415 --> 04:03.417
- Tiana's been crying,
asking for her brother.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.288
I direct
Child Services into this,

04:05.332 --> 04:08.813
they're gonna bust up
the only family she has.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.641
That's your call.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.645
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.736
I need to see her.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.825
- My lieutenant is with her
at the hospital.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.349
We'll know more soon.
- All right, that thing

04:22.392 --> 04:23.741
at the bodega.
Jerome and I,

04:23.785 --> 04:25.439
we were just trying
to find help, man.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.702
- Let's talk about
what happened before that.

04:27.745 --> 04:30.966
What were you and Tiana
doing at the playground?

04:31.009 --> 04:32.620
- Well, Tiana came home.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.839
She said she had a good grade
on her biology test.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.102
So I went to the store,
bought some vodka to celebrate.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.452
She's 16.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.367
- Well, it's not
a regular thing, you see--

04:40.410 --> 04:42.325
Tiana's smart,
and she's--

04:42.369 --> 04:44.327
And she's our ticket
out the hood, so,

04:44.371 --> 04:45.763
I wanted to do
something special for her.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.112
So we went
to the playground,

04:47.156 --> 04:48.549
and just hung out.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.118
- These guys,
six dudes,

04:53.162 --> 04:54.337
they pulled up, man.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.383
Black
How old?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.167
- Black, young.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.821
I don't know, my age?

04:59.864 --> 05:01.866
But one of them
threatened me.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.260
- One of them lifted
they shirt up,

05:04.304 --> 05:05.609
showed a gun in they waistband.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.350
Said I had to leave,
and Tiana had to stay.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.658
- Well, they said they were
gonna shoot me otherwise.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.921
I had no choice.
- Sure, you had a choice.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.226
You take a bullet.

05:14.270 --> 05:17.578
You don't leave
your little sister alone.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.883
- Yo, Malik came bookin'
out the playground,

05:18.927 --> 05:20.320
said Tiana was in trouble.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.843
- Wait, so you weren't
at the playground?

05:21.886 --> 05:23.192
- No, no, no, I was out
doing my thing,

05:23.235 --> 05:24.541
hanging with my girl,
you know?

05:24.585 --> 05:26.151
But we got in a fight,
so I went out for a walk

05:26.195 --> 05:27.239
while things blew over.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.545
She got a short memory.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.982
I ran into Malik.

05:32.419 --> 05:33.594
- I think you know
and then what.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.117
- So you didn't actually
see the guys

05:35.160 --> 05:36.379
who attacked Tiana?
- No.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.425
But Malik said
they in a gang.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.296
- I don't know!

05:40.340 --> 05:41.471
But they
real hard dudes.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.125
I mean no one
messes with them.

05:43.168 --> 05:46.868
- Let's get back
to the six guys.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.304
Height, weight.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.698
Hair, tats,
clothing.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.527
- It was dark.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.224
- I heard you say,
at the playground,

05:55.267 --> 05:56.312
that you would kill them.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.966
- Hell yeah.

05:59.881 --> 06:00.925
- Nah.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.972
- Yes.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.150
- You trying to help your
little sister or not, Malik?

06:08.193 --> 06:09.543
You didn't protect her.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.936
This is your chance
to make that right.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.421
- This isn't Malik's fault.
- What we want

06:18.465 --> 06:20.380
to focus on right now

06:20.423 --> 06:22.643
is catching the men
who did this to you.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.558
How many there were?

06:24.601 --> 06:27.038
What they looked like?
- Um...

06:27.082 --> 06:28.997
Yeah, three
of them, I think.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.565
It all happened so fast,
and I was out of it.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.696
I-I--

06:32.740 --> 06:34.437
I don't know, I don't know.
- Okay.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.873
Okay.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.093
I need my inhaler.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.574
Um--where--
where's my bag?

06:40.617 --> 06:42.271
- We didn't find anything
at the scene.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.927
- Hold on, listen, Tiana.
Is there anything

06:45.970 --> 06:48.582
that was in your bag
that might help us identify

06:48.625 --> 06:50.279
who took it,
like a credit card?

06:50.322 --> 06:51.846
- Our food card.
Our food card.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.413
How am I gonna do the shopping
for this week?

06:53.456 --> 06:54.936
We don't have any money!
- Okay.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.851
- Tiana, we can help you

06:56.894 --> 06:58.592
with that, okay?
- I don't want your help!

06:58.635 --> 07:01.159
I want my bag!
And I want to see Malik!

07:01.203 --> 07:02.552
- Can we--
excuse me,

07:02.596 --> 07:03.945
can we get a doctor
in here please?

07:05.860 --> 07:08.428
- She needs her inhaler.
- Okay.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.432
- Just breathe.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.781
Slowly now,
okay.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.523
10 milligrams
Albuterol.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.133
Good.
Good, good, good.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.874
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.966
- Malik said that
there were six assailants?

07:25.009 --> 07:27.359
- Black, young,
possibly gang affiliated.

07:27.403 --> 07:28.752
Malik didn't give us much
to go on.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.319
- Well, neither did Tiana.

07:30.362 --> 07:31.538
She said that
there were three of them.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.800
- She was pretty high.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.279
What about the friend,
Jerome?

07:34.323 --> 07:35.759
- He backs up Malik's story.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.500
I've got a call
into the gang unit.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.676
If this was some type
of initiation,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.157
somebody's probably telling
their friends how it went down.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.159
- Hey, I've got something
on Malik's SNAP card.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.380
- Yeah, it was flagged
last night at 2am.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.773
Somebody tried to use it.
It was denied

07:49.817 --> 07:51.819
at Lee's Liquors,
105th Street.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.647
- I know that place.
- Great,

07:53.690 --> 07:54.909
then they'll have
no problem telling you

07:54.952 --> 07:58.042
who tried
to use Tiana's card.

08:00.088 --> 08:01.568
- Lee.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.178
- I thought your boys
don't drink

08:03.221 --> 08:04.353
on the job anymore.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.746
- We're not thirsty.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.399
- We need the footage
from your security cams,

08:07.443 --> 08:09.967
last night,
around 2am.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.886
- They really know you
around here, huh?

08:15.930 --> 08:17.192
- Man, get your ass up

08:17.235 --> 08:18.367
and go get me that footage.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.890
Stop playing with me.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.240
- I was just making
a little joke.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.547
- Don't quit your day job.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.506
Send me everything you got.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.899
Thanks, Ramos,
I owe you one.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.466
- Gang unit recognize
this guy?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.163
- Yeah, they call
that guy "Four Stroke,"

08:32.207 --> 08:33.556
AKA Ray Wallis.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.558
He's on parole
for aggravated assault.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.864
- They got
a last known?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.953
- Nah, but this guy's
a fighter and a lover.

08:38.996 --> 08:39.910
He got four baby-mamas

08:39.954 --> 08:41.564
in four different
neighborhoods.

08:41.608 --> 08:42.783
- Living dangerously.
What do we do now?

08:42.826 --> 08:44.567
- We just sit
on all four addresses

08:44.611 --> 08:46.961
and wait on daddy
to come home.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.881
- Stay inside, ma'am.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.926
- Stone says
we're good.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.495
- NYPD!

09:01.758 --> 09:03.412
Where you going?

09:03.455 --> 09:05.022
Where you going?
Come here.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.589
Stop. Come here.
- Don't shoot my baby.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.722
- Hey, I didn't rape
that bitch, man.

09:08.765 --> 09:11.855
- What makes you think
we're here about a rape?

09:11.899 --> 09:14.815
- Talk about this down
at the station.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.730
- Put my chicken in the--

09:16.773 --> 09:19.602
We got a baby!

09:19.646 --> 09:21.082
- I won't press charges.
I won't press charges!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.736
You just gonna let her
assault me?

09:22.779 --> 09:25.869
You saw that, right?
- I ain't see nothing.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.397
- So Ray Wallis isn't one
of the rapists.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.877
- Might not be,
there are three

09:33.921 --> 09:35.487
separate DNA samples
from the rape kit.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.924
He's not one of them.
- Could have used a condom.

09:36.967 --> 09:39.622
- His girlfriend
is alibi'ing him.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.189
I know, I know.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.148
- Ray, if you don't
cooperate with us,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.542
you're just setting yourself
up for rape in the first.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.022
- We got you with a gun.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.110
You're on parole.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.415
You know
that's a violation,

09:50.459 --> 09:53.462
five years
mandatory federal time.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.859
Okay, cool,
I'll just call your P.O.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.512
- You know one hand
washes the other?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.514
You gotta help us help you.
Otherwise the only way

10:02.558 --> 10:05.213
you see your babies again
is from behind bars.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.175
- It's ringing.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.006
- Wait.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.402
I got the SNAP cards
from some kids.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.623
- Yeah.
Kids.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.407
Young.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.063
Too young to use it.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.023
And they were bragging about
how all three of them had sex

10:33.067 --> 10:36.157
with some girl
at the playground.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.212
Detectives Carisi
and Tutuola.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.561
We're with
Special Victims Unit.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.259
You mind if we come in?

10:51.302 --> 10:54.392
Why are you special?
- 'Cause of our good looks.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.832
- Mm-hmm.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.965
- Hmm, all right,
come in.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.576
So which one
you here for?

11:05.795 --> 11:07.057
- My boys.
I know you ain't here

11:07.101 --> 11:08.580
for this old bag
of bones.

11:08.624 --> 11:11.279
I used to have two
beautiful girls of my own.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.976
Lost them both
the same year

11:13.020 --> 11:15.718
to some damn powder
and the needle.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.807
- We're sorry to hear that.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.200
- I can see them.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.071
They still alive
in my grandkids.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.726
I made a promise
I'd take care of them.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.380
And that's Darryl

11:25.423 --> 11:26.337
and DeShawn.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.775
They twins,
14 years old.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.255
And their cousin, Leonard.
He's 15.

11:31.299 --> 11:34.084
- Do you know where
your grandkids are right now?

11:35.825 --> 11:38.132
- Down there.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.139
- Thank you
for your time.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.448
- Pass it!
Come on, bro.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.668
Pass it.
Come on.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.194
- Cops! Run!

11:58.500 --> 12:00.458
- Hey! Where do you think
you're going, huh?

12:00.502 --> 12:03.548
- Pro tip: Next time, run
in different directions.

12:03.592 --> 12:04.985
- Let's go.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.946
- This is Mrs. Hall.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.905
The three young men
are her grandsons.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.689
- They are innocent!
They told me

12:13.733 --> 12:15.125
what really happened!

12:15.169 --> 12:16.387
- Boys, why don't you
have a seat?

12:16.431 --> 12:19.042
- Come this way.
- Let's go.

12:21.001 --> 12:24.265
- I've called
a lawyer, Ron Carter.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.180
- Good to see you.
- There he is.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.138
- I heard of him.
He's a legend.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.661
- Oh, yeah, he worked
for the good guys

12:29.705 --> 12:31.141
at the hate crime unit.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.143
And now, he's every
prosecutor's nightmare.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.276
- Let's hope Carisi
has a rabbit foot somewhere.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.669
- Mr. Carter.
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.802
This is Detective Tutuola.
- Oh, boy.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
When I left
the DA's office,

12:41.586 --> 12:43.414
I thought the days
of dim precincts

12:43.458 --> 12:45.329
and their terrible coffee
were behind me.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.679
- Lucky for you, we're having
French roast today.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.333
- Mm!
Well,

12:49.377 --> 12:50.682
I'm gonna assume
you haven't spoken

12:50.726 --> 12:52.684
to those boys without
their attorney present.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.990
- Not at all.
We play by the book here.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.339
- Let's hope so,
Detective.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.688
- You should know
that the victim

12:56.732 --> 12:58.299
is on her way down here
to make an ID.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.953
- Well, since these boys
are innocent,

12:59.996 --> 13:01.868
that shouldn't be
a problem at all.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.173
- Well, then,
you should also know

13:03.217 --> 13:05.349
that we have DNA
from the rape kit.

13:05.393 --> 13:08.004
- And all three boys bragged
about having sex

13:08.048 --> 13:09.571
with the victim.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.833
Consensual sex.

13:10.877 --> 13:13.009
These boys
ain't raped anybody.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.664
Your victim
is a prostitute.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.147
- We had sex
with that girl,

13:20.190 --> 13:21.626
but we didn't
rape her!

13:21.670 --> 13:23.846
It--it can't be rape,
not if we paid for it!

13:23.890 --> 13:27.197
- Okay, then, why don't
you just tell us what happened?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.025
- Go ahead, son,
you can talk.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.984
- Me, Darryl,
DeShawn were hanging

13:31.027 --> 13:32.202
on the playground.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.552
We saw this girl
and guy together.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.467
They were drinking Absolut.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.687
We asked if they wanted
to party.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.997
- The guy was a pimp.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.607
He took me aside,
and said that

13:45.650 --> 13:47.217
we could all do her
for 200 bucks.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.046
- And tell them
what you told me.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.743
- So I went home,

13:51.787 --> 13:53.136
got my mom's ring,

13:53.180 --> 13:57.097
pawned it,
gave the guy 200 bucks.

13:57.140 --> 14:00.274
We had sex
with the girl.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.363
I'm sorry, Grandma--
- We will talk

14:02.406 --> 14:03.843
about that later.
- My clients,

14:03.886 --> 14:05.888
they're not proud
of what they did.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.108
But this
is not a rape.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.240
Not by a long stretch--
- Hold on.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.590
- No, you hold on, I'm ta--
- This victim

14:12.634 --> 14:15.071
was incapacitated.
She had drugs and alcohol

14:15.115 --> 14:16.638
in her system.

14:16.681 --> 14:19.467
- She went along.
She seemed fine.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.905
- Okay, the guy that was
with her, the pimp.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.602
You get a name?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.561
- Malik.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.916
- DeShawn and Darryl confirm
Leonard's version

14:33.960 --> 14:35.787
of what happened.
- Yeah, they're accused

14:35.831 --> 14:37.267
of rape; maybe they're just
making up an excuse.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.921
- Well, they're 14
and 15 years old.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.270
That's a sophisticated story.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.793
- Client is telling the truth.

14:41.837 --> 14:45.449
Pawned his mother's ring
last night at 10:30.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.538
- So Malik was pimping out
his little sister.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.932
- Then this story he told
the cops, about needing to use

14:49.976 --> 14:51.716
the bodega phone?
- Probably trying

14:51.760 --> 14:53.414
to call his dealer,
then something got busted,

14:53.457 --> 14:54.806
and he made up
this rape thing.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.200
- But Tiana said
she was raped, too.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.289
- He got to her.
On the playground.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.161
And she had to back up
her brother's story.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.293
- Go pick him up.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.738
- NYPD.
Open up, Malik.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.224
What you need?

15:21.268 --> 15:23.052
- You know why we're here.
Get out of the way.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.228
- Tiana!

15:26.577 --> 15:28.840
- Look, don't worry about her.
- Hey, baby.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.494
- She's just tired.
She's a little tired.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.409
- Shut up!

15:32.453 --> 15:34.020
- She's just tired!

15:35.586 --> 15:36.892
- Man, get your hands off me!

15:36.936 --> 15:39.329
What?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.508
Know what?
You ain't even worth it.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.380
Turn around.
You're under arrest.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.731
Tiana...
- Yeah...

15:57.826 --> 15:57.957
.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.784
- So Tiana
was passed out cold?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.569
- Rollins took her to the ER.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.745
- He's being processed.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.573
Child endangerment,
possession,

16:05.616 --> 16:06.922
and promoting prostitution.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.706
- Nope.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.534
It's not like
he's gonna confess

16:10.578 --> 16:12.058
to trafficking
his own sister.

16:12.101 --> 16:15.409
- No, that is gonna have
to come from Tiana herself.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.585
- I doubt
if that happens, either.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.587
- You had no right
to arrest Malik!

16:19.630 --> 16:20.762
- Malik's your guardian.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.155
You were
getting high together.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.419
- So, that's not taking
care of you.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.901
Huh? Wh--
Child Services?

16:29.945 --> 16:32.600
They don't know anything!
I'm not going there!

16:32.643 --> 16:34.732
- Well, you're not
going home again.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.084
- I was raped!

16:38.127 --> 16:40.216
You guys are supposed
to be on my side!

16:40.260 --> 16:42.044
- We are, Tiana, but--

16:42.088 --> 16:44.220
But some questions
have come up.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.354
- Well, your brother
takes care of you.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.182
He pays the bills.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.880
Everything that SNAP
doesn't cover.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.276
- Yeah.
- Well, that's...

16:56.319 --> 16:58.626
Gotta be hard on him.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.020
You help him out,
with that?

17:04.153 --> 17:05.937
- Um, sometimes.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.244
- So maybe you get paid
to babysit,

17:08.288 --> 17:10.986
or run errands, or...

17:11.030 --> 17:13.858
Hang out
with his friends?

17:16.296 --> 17:19.647
- If that's
what's going on, we get it.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.301
You're not
in any trouble, here.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.869
- But we do need you
to tell us the truth.

17:24.913 --> 17:28.047
So we can
help you, Tiana.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.312
So we can help

17:32.355 --> 17:35.271
your brother, too.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.881
Huh?

17:38.579 --> 17:40.668
- So you're asking me
if I sold my little sister

17:40.711 --> 17:41.799
to three
banger wanna

17:41.843 --> 17:43.105
- No!

17:43.149 --> 17:45.064
- And we're supposed
to believe you now,

17:45.107 --> 17:47.501
after you told us
it was six guys with a gun?

17:47.544 --> 17:48.806
- When it was three teenagers

17:48.850 --> 17:49.894
who said that
they paid you?

17:49.938 --> 17:51.983
- They raped Tiana!

17:52.027 --> 17:53.420
All right?
They'll say anything!

17:53.463 --> 17:55.204
- So will you!

17:55.248 --> 17:57.032
You're in big trouble
right now!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.860
- Why, because Tiana
went through my stash

17:58.903 --> 17:59.991
when I wasn't home?

18:00.035 --> 18:01.341
She shouldn't
be doing drugs,

18:01.384 --> 18:02.820
and she knows that!

18:10.524 --> 18:13.788
- Daddy left
when I was ten.

18:13.831 --> 18:17.183
And Mama went to prison
when I was 14.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.142
Malik...

18:20.186 --> 18:23.189
was the one
that made me waffles.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.713
He braided my hair.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.196
He got me to school.

18:30.239 --> 18:33.199
No TV if I didn't finish
my homework.

18:35.636 --> 18:39.030
He did everything
for me.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.554
He was the one that had
to drop out, so, yeah,

18:40.597 --> 18:42.338
whatever I can do
to help him, I do it.

18:42.382 --> 18:43.600
- Tiana...

18:43.644 --> 18:45.733
Did those boys pay

18:45.776 --> 18:46.951
to have sex with you?

18:46.995 --> 18:48.388
- 'Cause if they did,

18:48.431 --> 18:50.129
it is not on you.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.392
- They hurt me.
- And even if

18:52.435 --> 18:54.176
they did
pay your brother,

18:54.220 --> 18:57.571
if you didn't want to,
that's rape.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.400
- Just tell us
what happened.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.924
- And then you're gonna
let Malik go?

19:04.273 --> 19:07.668
- Why don't we take it
one step at a time, okay?

19:07.711 --> 19:10.105
- So that's a no.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.759
All right,
I'm out of here.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.240
- No, you're not.

19:14.283 --> 19:17.678
Tiana, I'm sorry,
but that's not gonna happen.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.550
Child Services
is already...

19:20.594 --> 19:22.944
On their way here.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.337
- No.
No, if--if--

19:24.380 --> 19:27.557
if you put me in foster care,
I will run away.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.654
Okay, well--

19:37.698 --> 19:40.048
What if I say
that I wasn't raped?

19:41.832 --> 19:42.877
No crime,

19:42.920 --> 19:44.705
no police, right?

19:44.748 --> 19:47.795
- Tiana--
- Nobody raped me!

19:47.838 --> 19:51.146
I wanted
to do those boys!

19:51.190 --> 19:53.583
Th--
This wasn't Malik's idea.

19:53.627 --> 19:57.196
This was all
my idea!

19:59.937 --> 20:01.896
- No victim, no case.
- Whether or not

20:01.939 --> 20:03.463
Tiana was pimped out,

20:03.506 --> 20:04.768
she was drugged.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.162
Incapable of consent,
that's rape.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.946
- Not if she
doesn't testify.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.296
We've just handed
the defense

20:10.339 --> 20:11.949
a motion to dismiss
on a silver platter.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.562
Mr. Carter's here.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.085
- On schedule.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.087
Send him in,
Carmen.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.700
- Mr. Stone!
Lieutenant Benson.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.311
This is my daughter,
Regina.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.530
- I'll be representing
Malik Williams.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.663
- I just want to know,

20:29.706 --> 20:31.012
why you haven't dropped
the charges

20:31.055 --> 20:32.143
against my clients?
- Because whether

20:32.187 --> 20:34.102
or not money
was exchanged,

20:34.145 --> 20:36.409
the victim
did not consent.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.846
She told police
that she was assaulted.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.761
- But that's not
what she's saying now.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.763
If I call
a press conference,

20:42.806 --> 20:44.199
this case?
It's gonna make

20:44.243 --> 20:45.505
the Central Park Five debacle

20:45.548 --> 20:47.594
look like
a public relations triumph.

20:47.637 --> 20:51.293
And, remind me, how much did
the city pay out to those boys?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.208
- We realize
what we're looking at.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.340
- So you're gonna drop
the charges.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.863
- I need to review
the evidence.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.648
- Well, take all
the time you need...

20:58.692 --> 21:00.084
Until 5:00 PM.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.912
Because that's
when I call the press,

21:01.956 --> 21:06.090
and explain how the NYPD
and the DA

21:06.134 --> 21:09.180
are railroading
innocent young black men.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.747
- Including Tiana's brother.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.706
- Come on, you know that
that's not what's going on.

21:12.749 --> 21:15.317
- We'll be in touch.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.971
Thank you.

21:18.581 --> 21:21.323
- Hey.
- We ran Malik's financials,

21:21.367 --> 21:22.890
what there are
of them.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.631
He and Tiana
get 352 a month

21:24.674 --> 21:26.850
in SNAP benefits.
No other legit income.

21:26.894 --> 21:27.938
- Yeah, and the rent
for the public

21:27.982 --> 21:29.244
housing apartment is 200.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.680
But this guy's
got a phone,

21:30.724 --> 21:32.552
he's got cable,
he's got a big-screen TV.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.162
- Okay, expenses, clothing.
- Uh-huh.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.295
- So he's making up
the extra.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.340
We just have to prove
it's from pimping out Tiana.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.386
- Yeah, so we pulled
Malik's phone records,

21:40.429 --> 21:41.909
tracked a dozen
of his associates.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.389
They're gang members,
drug dealers.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.999
- Not that anyone's

21:45.042 --> 21:46.740
admitted so far.
- But they all have records.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.437
It's just a matter of time
before they get picked up

21:48.481 --> 21:51.179
and need to deal.
- Like my friend here.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.400
- You gonna
introduce us?

21:54.443 --> 21:56.184
- Yeah, this is
Bobby Jackson.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.968
Just got busted
by narcotics

21:58.012 --> 21:59.361
with four kilos
of cocaine

21:59.405 --> 22:01.407
in the trunk
of his town car.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.627
He's also Malik
and Tiana's driver.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.200
He treats Tiana pretty good.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.724
Keeping her addicted
to heroin?

22:14.768 --> 22:16.073
- He doesn't beat her,

22:16.117 --> 22:17.510
take a taste for himself,
know what I mean?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.555
- So we're supposed
to feel great about this guy

22:19.599 --> 22:20.948
because he doesn't
sexually abuse

22:20.991 --> 22:22.341
his own sister?

22:22.384 --> 22:23.733
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, let's stick

22:23.777 --> 22:25.431
to the usual program.
You're gonna tell us

22:25.474 --> 22:27.128
who you saw,
what you saw,

22:27.171 --> 22:29.173
how many times
you saw it.

22:31.088 --> 22:33.352
- Bobby drove Tiana
to all her appointments.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.179
He also kept his eyes
on the road

22:35.223 --> 22:36.659
when she had to handle
business in the back seat.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.140
He has names, dates,
and cash amounts.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.534
- No.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.970
Pencil and paper.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.275
He kept
a written record

22:44.319 --> 22:46.495
so he could keep track
of his cut.

22:48.454 --> 22:51.326
- Did you really just get
this lucky?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.328
- Luck favors
the prepared.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.331
I called in a favor
in Narcotics.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.159
- This bust
is legit.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.204
- Absolutely.

23:03.164 --> 23:06.210
- Okay,
I'll call Stone.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.995
You really want
to get Malik.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.997
- He's the worst kind
of predator.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.477
He betrays his own.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.696
I mean his sister
really loves him,

23:13.740 --> 23:15.524
and he's throwing her away.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.097
- On the charge
of endangering a minor

23:23.140 --> 23:25.012
and sex trafficking,
how do you plead?

23:25.055 --> 23:26.230
- Not guilty,
Your Honor.

23:27.667 --> 23:28.755
- We request remand.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.365
Up until two days ago,
the defendant

23:30.409 --> 23:32.193
was the guardian
of his 16-year-old sister,

23:32.236 --> 23:33.499
who he's now charged
with trafficking.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.196
We believe he could be
a danger to her.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.199
- My client's main concern
is his sister's wellbeing.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.766
Mr. Williams would like
to clear his name,

23:39.809 --> 23:42.072
regain custody
of Ms. Williams, and--

23:42.116 --> 23:43.291
- Tiana.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.206
What are you--
You cannot be here.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.208
You cannot be in here!
- I ran away.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.470
I told you I would.
- You cannot be here!

23:48.514 --> 23:50.341
- My brother
didn't do anything!

23:50.385 --> 23:52.387
It was all my idea!
- Ms. Carter.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.650
- M-my apologies,
Your Honor.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.609
She's with me.
- Then take her out

23:56.652 --> 23:58.480
of my courtroom!
- Okay, of course.

23:58.524 --> 24:02.092
Let's go, come on.
Now, now.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.007
- You can't do this
to Malik!

24:04.051 --> 24:05.748
- Listen to me.
We don't have a choice.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.489
- I'm not going back
to Child Services!

24:07.533 --> 24:09.796
- We can arrest you
for filing a false report,

24:09.839 --> 24:12.625
send you to juvie.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.540
- Well, maybe you want
to take me home, daddy?

24:14.583 --> 24:16.324
- Stop it, you don't have
to be like that.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.673
- You're no fun.
- Tiana,

24:17.717 --> 24:20.154
you do have a choice,
actually.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.418
Either you go back
to Child Services or

24:23.462 --> 24:26.552
we arrest you
right now.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.512
So all that nice lady,
being my friend

24:30.556 --> 24:33.297
with that other detective,
that was all BS?

24:36.344 --> 24:39.347
Fine!
Take me back.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.480
- Take her back.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.744
- I'll radio a squad car
to drive her.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.095
- You know,
you say you care about me.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.792
You're lying.

24:52.969 --> 24:56.190
I know my brother loves me!

25:08.594 --> 25:08.811
.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.031
- I worked for Malik Williams
for two years.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.380
Drove him to drug buys,

25:12.423 --> 25:16.079
drove his sister Tiana
to her...dates.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.646
- And by dates,
you mean...

25:17.690 --> 25:19.866
- Meeting with guys who paid
to have sex with her.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.215
- And who collected
the cash?

25:21.258 --> 25:22.433
- I did, mostly.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.348
I'd take 10%,

25:24.392 --> 25:25.915
and give the rest
to Malik.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.920
- Did Tiana
go along with this?

25:30.964 --> 25:34.489
- Aside from her being 14
when it started...

25:34.533 --> 25:35.969
She was
so drugged up,

25:36.012 --> 25:38.145
she couldn't put
two words together.

25:42.279 --> 25:45.935
- Did you or Malik
use a weapon on Tiana?

25:45.979 --> 25:48.677
Or did you lock
the car doors?

25:48.721 --> 25:50.418
- No, I would never
do that.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.594
- So she was free
to go at any time.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.596
- Well, like I said,
she was so drugged up that--

25:54.640 --> 25:56.642
- Did she ever tell you
she was frightened

25:56.685 --> 25:57.904
of her brother?

25:57.947 --> 26:00.167
Or ask you for help
to escape?

26:01.951 --> 26:03.387
- No.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.607
- In fact,
didn't she talk about

26:05.651 --> 26:08.044
how well he took
care of her?

26:08.088 --> 26:09.698
How she was happy?

26:12.483 --> 26:14.094
You can look at me,
not the ADA

26:14.137 --> 26:16.966
who dropped charges against you
in exchange for your testimony

26:17.010 --> 26:18.751
against my client--
- Your Honor.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.448
- Testimony
that doesn't include

26:20.491 --> 26:24.104
anything you just told us
about the real criminals, here.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.845
Men who paid for sex

26:25.888 --> 26:28.238
with a drugged-out teenager.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.765
- Just answer the question,
Mr. Jackson.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.942
- She seemed okay.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.597
She always hugged him
when we got home.

26:41.904 --> 26:44.646
- Redirect,
Your Honor.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.213
Did Tiana tell you
how happy she was

26:46.256 --> 26:47.649
when she was incapacitated?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.608
Being raped by strangers,
in the back seat

26:49.651 --> 26:51.000
of a town car,
so her brother could support

26:51.044 --> 26:52.654
his drug habit?
- Objection!

26:52.698 --> 26:54.221
- Overruled.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.571
The witness may answer.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.181
- No.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.967
She didn't say much
of anything, then.

27:06.189 --> 27:07.495
- Tiana.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.236
What did you tell
the police, when they

27:09.279 --> 27:11.542
found you
on the playground?

27:11.586 --> 27:13.066
- I don't know.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.982
- What did you tell them
in the hospital?

27:18.462 --> 27:19.550
Permission
to treat the witness

27:19.594 --> 27:20.856
as hostile,
Your Honor?

27:20.900 --> 27:21.988
- Granted.

27:22.031 --> 27:23.554
Tiana?

27:23.598 --> 27:25.339
You need to answer
the questions.

27:25.382 --> 27:27.820
Do you understand?

27:27.863 --> 27:30.170
- Yes.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.302
- You initially told the cops
that you had been raped,

27:32.346 --> 27:34.217
isn't that right?

27:34.261 --> 27:35.479
- Yes.

27:37.046 --> 27:39.483
- No.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.007
- You lied
to protect your brother,

27:41.050 --> 27:41.921
because he had

27:41.964 --> 27:43.531
pimped you out
for $200?

27:43.574 --> 27:44.706
- No, that was my idea.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.229
My brother didn't
do anything.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.666
- Didn't he lie
to the cops?

27:47.709 --> 27:48.841
Tell them you'd been raped?

27:48.884 --> 27:49.972
- No, he was trying
to make sure

27:50.016 --> 27:51.365
that I didn't get
into trouble.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.714
- So you went along
with his lie

27:52.758 --> 27:53.846
the same way
you are right now.

27:53.889 --> 27:56.065
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.851
Do you love your brother?

27:58.894 --> 28:00.417
- Yes.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.376
- He's been
your sole caretaker

28:02.419 --> 28:04.204
since you were 14.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.076
- Yes.
- If your brother's convicted,

28:07.120 --> 28:09.775
you'll end up
in foster care indefinitely.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.603
Wouldn't you say
anything

28:12.647 --> 28:13.866
to keep that
from happening?

28:13.909 --> 28:16.607
- Objection, Your Honor--
- Withdrawn.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.614
Nothing further.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.057
- Tiana...

28:31.100 --> 28:33.929
Is your brother
Malik

28:33.973 --> 28:38.542
drugging you or forcing you
into prostitution?

28:38.586 --> 28:40.806
- No.
No, he's not.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.374
- We've heard testimony

28:44.418 --> 28:45.767
that you've engaged

28:45.811 --> 28:48.988
in sexual solicitation.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.774
- I'm not proud of that.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.081
I needed money.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.735
- So...

28:56.778 --> 28:58.693
this was all
your idea?

29:00.129 --> 29:01.827
I had to.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.916
After Mama
was sent away,

29:03.959 --> 29:06.440
Malik worked construction.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.659
And he got
into a fight.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.924
It wasn't his fault,
but he got fired.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.318
Assistance...

29:15.362 --> 29:17.407
barely paid rent.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.152
When I was 13,
all I wanted

29:23.196 --> 29:26.112
was a puppy.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.767
Malik said
that we couldn't afford that.

29:34.381 --> 29:36.426
So no movies,
no going out.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.037
Um...

29:39.995 --> 29:42.215
I couldn't sleep nights,

29:42.258 --> 29:44.957
worrying about
what might happen if

29:45.000 --> 29:47.220
we couldn't make rent.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.402
I just wanted that feeling
to go away, I didn't--

29:55.445 --> 29:57.621
To not be worried.

29:57.665 --> 30:00.842
My stomach hurting
all the time.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.066
Thinking, maybe,
it might be better

30:07.109 --> 30:10.852
if I got shot.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.549
Mostly I just wanted
the bad stuff

30:12.593 --> 30:13.855
to just go away

30:13.899 --> 30:16.771
for a little while.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.519
I l--

30:25.562 --> 30:27.826
I love my brother.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.873
He's all I have.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.405
- Thank you, Tiana.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.720
- People rest,
Your Honor.

30:54.765 --> 30:57.333
- Defense calls
LaShonda Williams.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.905
This witness wasn't
on the list, Your Honor.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.167
- She's been
in the infirmary

31:05.211 --> 31:06.734
in Bedford Hills
Correctional

31:06.777 --> 31:08.518
after an attack
by her cellmate.

31:08.562 --> 31:11.391
We weren't sure
if she'd be able to testify.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.741
We just found out
she's recovered enough

31:13.784 --> 31:15.743
to travel.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.310
- I'll need time to prepare,
Your Honor.

31:17.353 --> 31:21.270
- You can take
the lunch recess, Mr. Stone.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.098
We're adjourned.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.411
- Malik has always

31:31.454 --> 31:32.847
been the real man

31:32.891 --> 31:34.805
of the family.

31:37.025 --> 31:40.333
My husband was
a waste of skin.

31:40.376 --> 31:43.205
Well, Malik,
he saved me and Tiana.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.991
After my husband left,
we had a real nice life.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.167
- Then you were convicted
of assault?

31:48.210 --> 31:49.864
- Yeah, I had my struggles.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.257
Drink and drugs.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.606
Regret my mistakes,
but I'm working

31:52.649 --> 31:54.173
on being a better mother.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.263
- The court appointed Malik
as an interim guardian

31:57.306 --> 31:59.439
while you served your time?
- He was taking care of her,

31:59.482 --> 32:01.789
taking her to visit me,
taking her to school,

32:01.832 --> 32:03.878
making sure she stay
out of trouble.

32:05.662 --> 32:08.622
- Not always.

32:08.665 --> 32:10.624
Tiana headstrong,
she willful.

32:10.667 --> 32:11.930
She does what she wants.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.671
- Including acting out
sexually?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.499
- Objection.
- Overruled.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.414
Witness may answer.

32:18.458 --> 32:19.633
- Yeah.

32:19.676 --> 32:20.895
I seen that in her,

32:20.939 --> 32:25.291
even as a 14-year-old.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.293
- So these charges
against your son,

32:27.336 --> 32:28.990
where do you think they--

32:29.034 --> 32:31.471
The cops, the DA,
they making a mistake.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.560
They know how bad
these teenage girls be.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.301
Malik loves Tiana.

32:35.344 --> 32:38.260
He would never
do nothin' to hurt her.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.480
- Thank you,
Ms. Williams.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.308
No further questions.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.834
- Is everything all right,
Mr. Stone?

32:46.877 --> 32:48.618
Your witness.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.021
- The man you assaulted,
Luke Snell?

33:00.065 --> 33:01.327
- Objection.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.937
- What's going on,
Mr. Stone?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.330
- It's my cross examination,
Your Honor.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.896
- How is any
of this relevant?

33:05.940 --> 33:07.028
- Goes to credibility.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.770
Best I can do
on short notice.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.598
- I'll allow it.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.035
- Ms. Williams,

33:14.079 --> 33:15.906
two years ago,
you slashed Luke Snell

33:15.950 --> 33:18.170
with a straight-razor.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.955
- Yes, I did.
Everybody knows that.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.261
- Does everybody
know why?

33:22.304 --> 33:23.871
- Objection.
Again, relevance.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.134
- I'll allow it,
Ms. Carter.

33:28.919 --> 33:31.096
- Why did you slash
his face?

33:33.533 --> 33:36.057
- I'll take the 5th.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.190
- You don't want
to incriminate yourself?

33:42.411 --> 33:44.022
- Is that because
you assaulted Mr. Snell

33:44.065 --> 33:45.197
in an argument
about money

33:45.240 --> 33:46.894
after he paid
your pimp

33:46.937 --> 33:48.635
who also happens
to be your son?

33:48.678 --> 33:50.941
- Objection.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.250
- No,
it wasn't Malik's fault.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.165
He was going through
a-a-a bad patch.

33:57.209 --> 33:58.732
We needed the cash!

33:58.775 --> 34:00.081
Now, I pled guilty.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.301
So nobody needed
to know that part.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.651
- Malik was working
as your pimp,

34:04.694 --> 34:06.435
trafficking you?

34:07.567 --> 34:09.786
The same way he's trafficking
your daughter now?

34:09.830 --> 34:11.614
- Objection,
Your Honor!

34:14.139 --> 34:15.792
- Withdrawn.

34:15.836 --> 34:18.143
- The jury
will disregard.

34:18.186 --> 34:20.928
The witness
is excused.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.408
We're in recess.

34:30.285 --> 34:31.765
- Tiana.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.466
My daddy used
to rape my mama.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.990
And then Malik
does that to her...

34:40.034 --> 34:41.253
- I know he's
your big brother,

34:41.296 --> 34:43.559
and I know you think
you owe him.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.300
But you don't.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.566
- Let me get you back
to ACS.

34:58.487 --> 35:00.924
- Malik trafficked
his mother, too?

35:00.968 --> 35:04.754
- And they're both
blaming it on Tiana.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.322
- Man, that family
had it rough.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.933
- Same as everyone
that grows up in the Projects.

35:09.977 --> 35:12.284
Some will make it out,
some won't.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.330
But we all make
our own choices.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.030
- You don't talk about
your childhood much.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.034
- Back at you, Lieu.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.998
- Lieutenant Benson.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.348
What?

35:36.743 --> 35:38.788
Where?

35:40.442 --> 35:43.184
What happened to Tiana?
- Heroin overdose.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.012
- In her apartment.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.318
Neighbors called 911.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.669
- EMTs said
they're not sure.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.627
It's their tenth OD tonight.

36:05.772 --> 36:05.989
.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.470
- Lucky to be alive.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.080
- She got a hot-shot
of China white.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.560
The EMTs said her heart
stopped in the ambulance.

36:11.604 --> 36:12.953
- Well, she didn't do
this on her own.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.607
- No, probably not.
We're pulling security cams

36:14.650 --> 36:16.043
from the housing projects.
- Fin's canvassing

36:16.086 --> 36:17.523
the neighborhood.
He's leaning on narcotics,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.046
the gang unit.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.787
- His lawyer says
that he's devastated,

36:20.830 --> 36:22.223
and he does not
know anything about it.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.965
- Okay, check the call logs,
visitor records.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.707
Keep me posted.
- On it.

36:28.751 --> 36:31.972
- Look, I got a bad dose.
It happens.

36:32.929 --> 36:35.105
- So who did
you buy it from?

36:35.149 --> 36:36.846
- I don't know his name.
- But it was one

36:36.890 --> 36:38.500
of your brother's dealers.
- Okay, I'm not

36:38.544 --> 36:40.241
telling you that.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.071
- When is the last time
you talked to Malik?

36:44.114 --> 36:45.899
- I'm not telling you
that either.

36:45.942 --> 36:49.729
- You do know that the calls
are recorded at Rikers, right?

36:49.772 --> 36:52.035
- Fine, I-I-I called him
this afternoon.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.255
I asked him
if what he said was true.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.649
- He said
it wasn't true.

36:56.692 --> 37:01.349
- So your mother's lying.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.003
Tiana,

37:03.046 --> 37:06.398
your brother
is making her a liar,

37:06.441 --> 37:10.619
just like
he's making you a liar

37:10.663 --> 37:13.056
and a whore and an addict,

37:13.100 --> 37:14.580
Is that what you
want your life to be?

37:14.623 --> 37:15.581
Because I don't think that it
is.

37:15.624 --> 37:16.756
- Just shut up!

37:16.799 --> 37:18.192
You don't know anything
about me!

37:18.236 --> 37:19.715
- I don't know, you're right!
I don't know a lot.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.369
But I do know some things,
because

37:21.413 --> 37:23.371
I talked to your teachers.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.764
And you know
what they told me?

37:24.807 --> 37:26.113
They told me
that you were

37:26.156 --> 37:27.897
a straight-A student.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.769
They told me that
you like superheroes,

37:29.812 --> 37:31.466
especially Wonder Woman.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.381
And your freshman
English teacher told me

37:33.425 --> 37:34.991
that you wrote
one of the best,

37:35.035 --> 37:38.256
best essays that she
has ever read.

37:39.518 --> 37:40.780
She said that you...

37:40.823 --> 37:42.347
that you wanna be
like Wonder Woman,

37:42.390 --> 37:43.826
'cause you want
to help people.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.438
- I can't do that now.
I was stupid then.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.179
- You're not stupid,
you weren't.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.094
Listen to me.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.317
You can be whatever

37:56.361 --> 37:59.015
you want to be.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.322
I know that Malik
is your family.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.717
But just because
he's your family

38:04.760 --> 38:07.415
doesn't mean...

38:07.459 --> 38:09.939
that he wants
what's best for you.

38:14.596 --> 38:17.382
I know this one.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.123
Believe me.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
- Okay, I got him.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.134
Thanks.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.137
- I'm saying, like, it don't--
it don't matter.

38:34.181 --> 38:35.704
You know what I'm saying?
Like you get where you supposed

38:35.748 --> 38:37.402
to be,
you where you supposed to be...

38:37.445 --> 38:38.838
- Jerome.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.580
Hey!
Don't make me chase you.

38:41.623 --> 38:44.017
And don't make me
shoot you.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.587
Come on.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.240
- It wasn't my idea,
I swear.

38:50.284 --> 38:53.287
- Malik's.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.290
- You tryin' to tell us Malik
told you to give his own sister

38:56.334 --> 38:58.553
a hot shot and kill her?
- He said to take care of her,

38:58.597 --> 38:59.728
that if she
testified against him,

38:59.772 --> 39:01.643
it was all over.

39:06.779 --> 39:09.390
- I'm sorry, Tiana.

39:09.434 --> 39:10.739
- Do not
feel sorry for me.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.959
- We don't.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.744
We know
how strong you are.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.661
And we also know

39:19.705 --> 39:22.142
that you're gonna
be okay.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.799
- Our daddy didn't just
rape our mama.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.540
He beat Malik.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.150
He beat the hell
out of him.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.848
- You shut up.
- You protected us!

39:35.721 --> 39:39.986
After he left, it was okay
for a while, but...

39:40.029 --> 39:41.640
It was like
you hated yourself

39:41.683 --> 39:42.902
for what he did to us.

39:42.945 --> 39:45.208
For what he did
to you.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.951
The drugs helped.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.519
But then we needed
more drugs.

39:51.563 --> 39:52.999
More money.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.393
The money had to come
from somewhere.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.788
I don't hate you, Malik.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.837
I don't want to testify.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.058
But I will if I have to.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.061
- I think we can
reach a deal,

40:12.105 --> 40:14.499
spare Tiana
from testifying.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.459
- Let's talk.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.898
- Yeah, thank you
for coming in.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.426
- I love you, T.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.881
- So Malik took a deal.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.273
Fifteen years.

40:50.317 --> 40:53.494
- Good.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.235
- Fin...

40:55.278 --> 40:57.629
Look, it's no excuse
for what he did

40:57.672 --> 41:01.154
to Tiana, but...

41:01.197 --> 41:03.243
But he was brutalized, too.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.984
- And we both know
it doesn't matter

41:05.027 --> 41:08.291
what happens to you in life;
it's how you deal with it.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.860
- How about
you get out of here?

41:11.904 --> 41:13.383
What, and go home

41:13.427 --> 41:15.429
and feed my parakeet?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.126
- Something like that.

41:17.170 --> 41:19.912
Good night, Fin.
- Good night, Liv.

41:35.362 --> 41:38.887
What's up, Jaden?
You answering the phone now?

41:38.931 --> 41:40.846
What's up?
Heard you said "Pop-Pop"!

41:40.889 --> 41:42.282
That's what's up!

41:42.325 --> 41:44.414
Tell your dads
I'm coming over.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.546
I'ma get some pizza.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.940
You like pizza, little man?

41:47.983 --> 41:50.464
Yeah?
You're a big ol' boy.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.422
Love you!

42:00.561 --> 42:00.909
.

42:03.608 --> 42:10.832
