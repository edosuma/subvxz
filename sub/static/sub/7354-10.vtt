00:01.935 --> 00:03.268
<i>Previously on</i> legends...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.438
Did I work for verax?
Is that why they targeted me?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.007
Their ceo is jason shaw.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.775
<i>Spent seven years</i>
<i>with the green berets.</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:13.278
Agent martin odum-- I've been
looking for this son of a bitch

00:13.280 --> 00:14.313
For ten years.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.547
In 2004,

00:15.549 --> 00:17.716
<i>The director of</i>
<i>the bureau, director bennett,</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:20.285
<i>Said that you'd been</i>
<i>in an accident. Head injury.</i>

00:20.287 --> 00:21.954
When I woke up
in the hospital,

00:21.956 --> 00:24.456
I had no memory
of my life before.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.960
<i>You and gates, you helped me</i>
<i>put my past back together.</i>

00:27.962 --> 00:30.129
Maggie:
<i>His whole life is</i>
<i>a fabrication.</i>

00:30.131 --> 00:32.064
Why go to all that trouble
to hide the truth?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.565
Gates:
<i>To protect you.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.034
Martin:
<i>Protect me from who?</i>

00:35.036 --> 00:38.237
The answers are in here.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.506
There you are, mccombs and me.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.341
Where was this photo taken?
Someplace in iraq.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.709
Who was I before?!

00:43.711 --> 00:46.912
You want to know who you are--
verax does know.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.915
Spiller:
John cameron. He's their
number one covert agent.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.684
He may be planning some sort
of false flag terrorist attack.

00:52.686 --> 00:53.585
Bring me

00:53.587 --> 00:54.586
<i>Martin odum.</i>

00:54.588 --> 00:56.588
Get down!
(rapid gunfire)

00:56.590 --> 00:59.425
Shaw:
<i>Tell the boys,</i>
<i>be ready for a fight.</i>

00:59.427 --> 01:01.326
Martin.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.362
(panting)

01:03.364 --> 01:05.030
(droning beep)
she's crashing.
Sonya.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.366
Sonya. Please stay with me.
Out of the way, sir.
Out of the way, sir.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.001
Oh.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.205
(rhythmic beeping)

01:13.207 --> 01:14.773
(phone ringing)

01:14.775 --> 01:16.842
Man (over phone):
Where are you?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.344
I'm at the hospital
with the asset.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.413
Someone's coming. You need
to get him out of there now.

01:25.185 --> 01:28.120
Hurry. You don't have much time.

01:50.477 --> 01:54.613
Sir, this floor is
off-limits to visitors.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.581
Hospital's been compromised.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.317
Request immediate
exfil to edwards.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.087
Man:
Already on my way. I'll pick you
and the asset up in ten.

02:35.089 --> 02:36.421
Hurry.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.090
Where are we going?

02:38.092 --> 02:39.424
Somewhere safe.

02:39.426 --> 02:42.127
And, sarah, remember, from
here on out, stay in legend.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.629
Copy that.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.930
Who are you?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.932
I'm your wife.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.288
(rhythmic beeping)

03:15.795 --> 03:18.497
Hi.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.132
Thank you.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.967
Hi.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.869
Is mom gonna be okay?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.671
Uh, she's...

03:25.673 --> 03:29.308
She-she's gonna
be all right.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.378
Sit down.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.649
How are you doing?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.218
I'm okay.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.086
You're a brave boy.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.055
You know that?

03:43.057 --> 03:45.157
I'm proud of you.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.659
Proud of you for
staying strong.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.661
Dad?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.663
Catch them.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.398
The guys who did this.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.103
I will.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.107
I love you, son.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.309
I love you, too.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.312
(door opens)

04:08.848 --> 04:12.184
Hi. Well, thank your wife
for taking aiden tonight.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.752
It's no problem.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.054
Hey, are you hungry?

04:16.056 --> 04:19.124
All right.
Hey, I'll see you first thing
tomorrow morning, promise.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.764
Crystal:
How's sonya doing?
She's lucky

04:25.766 --> 04:27.299
Is what she is.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.900
We're gonna keep her safe.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.370
She's under another name.
We have agents

04:31.372 --> 04:32.804
All over this hospital.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.741
I'm sorry that your family
had to go through this.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.876
I spoke to my dad.
Ah. Did hell freeze over?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.478
(laughs)

04:39.480 --> 04:41.880
And what did
the vice admiral have to say?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.649
Operation raining fire.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.716
It was a cover-up.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.251
It was one of worst

04:46.253 --> 04:47.919
Friendly fire incidents

04:47.921 --> 04:49.655
During the iraq war.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.057
We bombed our own position
at an oil rig

04:52.059 --> 04:53.759
In basra in 2004.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.228
Almost 400 people died,

04:56.230 --> 04:58.163
Including a full platoon
of marines.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.898
Why would we bomb
our own soldiers?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.566
I don't know.
The rig

05:01.568 --> 05:02.934
Was overseen by verax.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.736
They're trying
to hide the details.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.172
Okay.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.007
It's your turn.
No more putting me off.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.515
There was no
car accident.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.983
I was there.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.651
I was in iraq.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.321
That's where
I was injured.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.424
I don't remember much,
just pieces, but...

05:25.426 --> 05:27.426
It was bad.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.095
So, verax is worried
because they think that

05:30.097 --> 05:32.431
You're gonna expose their
involvement in raining fire?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.433
Maybe.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.401
Maybe there's something more.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.708
Martin odum is a legend.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.210
My true identity's

05:45.212 --> 05:46.678
Classified.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.115
I don't know my own name.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.850
My god, martin.

05:51.852 --> 05:56.188
You've been living a legend
for almost ten years.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.192
I'm the man who knows too much.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.796
Except I forgot.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.299
Spiller:
<i>This briefing is to be kept</i>
<i>strictly confidential.</i>

06:07.301 --> 06:08.800
No one is to share any details

06:08.802 --> 06:11.970
Of this investigation
with anyone outside dco.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.840
From now on,
anything verax stays inside

06:14.842 --> 06:17.843
This room, and you should all
be deeply concerned

06:17.845 --> 06:19.811
That verax was able
to find the safe house.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.979
Rice:
You're saying

06:20.981 --> 06:22.647
Verax has agents within the fbi.

06:22.649 --> 06:25.083
No one outside the agency could
have known where martin was,

06:25.085 --> 06:28.553
So we have to assume that
the bureau has been compromised.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.657
Spiller:
We can confirm that verax

06:32.659 --> 06:34.493
Is planning some kind
of operation

06:34.495 --> 06:35.660
Inside the u.S.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.262
Our suspicions are based

06:37.264 --> 06:38.697
On communications intercepts

06:38.699 --> 06:40.332
Centered on this man.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.600
John cameron.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.502
He was part

06:43.504 --> 06:46.338
Of verax's operation
during the iraq war.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.939
Personally, I think
he orchestrated the assault

06:47.941 --> 06:50.509
On the safe house,
and on martin specifically.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.344
Other than that,
we don't know much about him.

06:52.346 --> 06:55.013
Now we believe
he's plotting an attack

06:55.015 --> 06:57.115
On american soil.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.421
We have got
to find this guy, people.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.591
I spoke with the prime asset.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.293
The plan continues apace.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.828
You seem troubled, tomlin.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.801
We're targeting an american
on american soil.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.035
It's crossing the line.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.036
There's no line.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.938
The world is changing.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.139
Borders don't matter.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.875
States,
governments don't matter.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.310
Sovereignty
is reserved

07:25.312 --> 07:29.047
For those with the means
to dictate outcomes.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.882
That's us.

07:34.987 --> 07:36.988
Fortune favors the bold.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.558
We're moving forward
with the plan.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.893
It's time for a
change in leadership.

07:41.895 --> 07:45.564
But the risk profile
is not insignificant.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.932
The only risk is doing nothing.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.600
Our asset

07:48.602 --> 07:50.569
Will take over
the one federal agency

07:50.571 --> 07:52.971
Posing a threat to us.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.341
John cameron will take care
of martin odum.

07:57.743 --> 07:59.644
And odum takes the fall.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.621
Rice:
Verax didn't know who
they were messing with

08:09.623 --> 08:12.824
When they sent these guys
after you at that safe house.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.427
(camera shutter clicking)

08:15.429 --> 08:18.263
Maggie, you seeing this?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.599
Yeah, I got it.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.667
I'm running
facial recognition now.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.803
It's not bringing anything up
on face rec.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.004
That's weird.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.040
(clicks)

08:29.042 --> 08:31.610
Rice:
Operation enduring freedom.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.379
He was a ranger.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.648
Okay, I'm pulling up
82nd's personnel list

08:36.650 --> 08:39.117
From '04, '06.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.119
Servicemen should be
in the system.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.888
Wait a minute.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.122
There's a reason
you can't find him.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.957
He's had plastic surgery.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.793
Yeah? Didn't want anyone
to know who he was.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.296
Maggie:
Hey, guys, wait a minute.
Go back to his arm.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.299
There's some kind
of rectangular shadow below

08:54.301 --> 08:56.001
His tattoo.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.303
Do you see it?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.505
Rice:
You sure? There's
nothing there.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.973
Hey, I know this sounds crazy,

09:01.975 --> 09:04.309
But put the infrared filter
on your camera.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.381
(beeping)

09:09.383 --> 09:11.149
Oh, nice get, mags.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.317
Very impressed.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.987
Any idea what the code means?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.756
Somehow, I don't think it's his
meth dealer's cell phone.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.827
Martin:
<i>Martin odum is a legend...</i>
<i>Odum is a legend.</i>

09:22.829 --> 09:25.430
Did I work
for verax... <i>Verax?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

09:25.432 --> 09:26.598
I'm the man who knows too much.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.666
Except I forgot...
<i>Except I forgot.</i>

09:27.668 --> 09:29.935
Verax does know.
They were in iraq,

09:29.937 --> 09:32.938
<i>2004... 2004.</i>

09:34.840 --> 09:36.808
Let me see your phone.

09:41.013 --> 09:44.282
(beeping)

09:47.587 --> 09:50.322
Looks like he went
to the same ink joints as me.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.061
I've been trying for hours,

09:56.063 --> 09:58.930
And I still can't make heads
or tails of these tattoos.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.199
They're not socials,
they're not cells.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.634
They aren't anything.
They're just a jumble

10:02.636 --> 10:03.868
Of numbers and letters.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.470
They're employee
identification codes

10:05.472 --> 10:07.472
For verax.
I had friends

10:07.474 --> 10:09.975
At the nsa check
the codes.
I hope

10:09.977 --> 10:12.477
They didn't send up
any red flags.
They covered their inquiries.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.646
There are a lot of people
out there who share our concerns

10:14.648 --> 10:17.115
About verax. You can trust
the information.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.150
What about martin's tattoo?
Anything come up?

10:19.152 --> 10:22.053
They looked at a few files,
but...

10:22.055 --> 10:23.221
Let me guess,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.890
No trace.
They were redacted.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.930
The merc's name
is trent mcfadyen.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.499
He's a green beret.
Three tours in afghanistan.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.501
Suspected of war crime
atrocities

10:36.503 --> 10:37.602
While working
for verax

10:37.604 --> 10:38.903
In 2007.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.405
His last known
address is

10:40.407 --> 10:42.040
In echo park on alvarado.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.655
Oh, forget it.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.438
Crystal:
Looks like we got
the right place.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.173
Martin:
Yeah, they're not plotting
some random attack.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.008
It's an assassination.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.712
This baby's got a range
of 1,500 meters.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.414
Yeah, so who's the target?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.718
(beep)

11:28.120 --> 11:29.287
Found a burner phone
and some cash.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.123
I'm going to run the
serial numbers off this money.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.158
We need to get forensics
in here.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.493
Forensics won't find anything.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.563
This guy doesn't make mistakes.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.632
(phone ringing)

11:40.634 --> 11:41.866
Hello.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.334
Man:
I hear you've been looking
for me.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.836
Who is this?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.971
Real proud of yourself,
putting my guys in the morgue.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.973
Cameron.
(quietly):
Maggie,

11:48.975 --> 11:50.141
Trace the incoming call
on martin's phone

11:50.143 --> 11:51.810
Right now.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.579
Okay, crystal. Give me a second.
It's encrypted.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.650
I'm on it just as long as
it's not a 2048-bit algorithm.

11:58.652 --> 12:02.320
Man:
Good bit of work
finding my apartment.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.488
That's a nice rifle
you got here.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.923
I've got others.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.991
And now I know
you're looking for me,

12:06.993 --> 12:08.660
My timetable just moved up.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.995
Yeah? Who's the target?

12:10.997 --> 12:12.931
Always asking questions.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.267
Good to see you haven't changed
since we last saw each other.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.669
Yeah. Is this back in iraq?

12:17.671 --> 12:19.104
So it's true then.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.272
You don't remember
what happened.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.841
When the bombs fell.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.843
I know who you are.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.277
Cameron.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.213
I don't think you do.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.415
And I don't think you know
what I'm capable of.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.417
But you'll see.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.519
The blood will be
on your hands.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.588
(line clicks, dial tone drones)

12:44.230 --> 12:46.231
Martin:
<i>Martin odum is a legend.</i>

12:46.233 --> 12:48.233
<i>I'm not who I think I am.</i>

12:48.235 --> 12:50.201
Mccombs:
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>
<i>He doesn't exist.</i>

12:50.203 --> 12:52.070
Martin:
<i>I want the truth, damn it!</i>
<i>You said</i>

12:52.072 --> 12:53.471
<i>It was all in my head,</i>
<i>but it's not, is it?</i>

12:53.473 --> 12:54.906
<i>You've been lying to me.</i>

12:54.908 --> 12:56.975
Rice:
Okay?

12:57.910 --> 13:01.379
Not until we find this guy.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.381
I reached out to a friend
of mine at the treasury.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.050
I gave him the serial numbers
of some of the cash we found.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.419
Yeah?
He did a trace.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.089
These bills were part
of a cash shipment to iraq.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.058
Pacification funds.
Paying off the enemy.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.095
How'd they get here?
My buddy says
it's the...

13:17.097 --> 13:18.663
Dirty little secret of the war.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.232
Over a billion dollars
went missing.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.736
(indistinct shouting)

13:24.738 --> 13:27.472
Rice:
<i>First they thought the iraqis</i>
<i>were hijacking the trucks.</i>

13:29.575 --> 13:32.410
<i>Then they started thinking</i>
<i>that it was an inside job.</i>

13:32.412 --> 13:34.579
<i>And guess where the trail</i>
<i>led back to.</i>

13:34.581 --> 13:37.849
Verax.

13:37.851 --> 13:41.920
Rice:
<i>Nobody wants to say it,</i>
<i>but, yeah, verax.</i>

13:41.922 --> 13:44.322
(indistinct shouting)

13:44.324 --> 13:46.224
(gunshots)

13:48.494 --> 13:51.029
They killed american soldiers,
man.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.664
Executed 'em.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.500
And guess
who the prime suspect was.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.502
Cameron.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.504
Rice:
<i>Then all of a sudden</i>
<i>the money just disappears,</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:00.705
<i>Just like that.</i>

14:02.608 --> 14:04.008
Were you there, martin?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.543
Were you there
with verax?

14:05.545 --> 14:06.878
In iraq? Were you there?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.683
Mccombs and evans, they were.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.852
Were you there
when they stole that cash?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.320
Is that what this is about?

14:15.322 --> 14:17.722
Were you part
of the heist?

14:17.724 --> 14:18.990
Still nothing
on the burner phone,

14:18.992 --> 14:20.959
But maggie traced the call
that martin got

14:20.961 --> 14:22.460
To a motel off route 14.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.796
Let's get cameron.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.198
Let's go.

14:40.145 --> 14:43.081
Maggie says the call
definitely came from there.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.318
No activity.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.554
Let me
take a look.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.589
I'll be right back.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.841
You doing okay?

15:13.345 --> 15:15.546
Do you think I'm a good man?

15:15.548 --> 15:18.016
What do you mean?

15:18.018 --> 15:22.387
Just after what happened
to sonya and aiden.

15:22.389 --> 15:26.224
You know I had to do things
in legend, hmm?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.293
Violence.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.030
You were sanctioned, martin.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.198
It's not the fbi sanction
I'm worried about.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.868
(laughs)

15:36.870 --> 15:38.069
You worry you're
gonna have to answer

15:38.071 --> 15:40.204
For what you did undercover.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.708
I don't know who I am.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.210
Don't know
what my soul looks like.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.619
I think you're a good man.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.988
(car door opens)

15:58.958 --> 16:00.491
All right, place
looks deserted.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.894
There's a car down there
that's missing a front tire.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.463
And some truck that looks like
it hasn't been moved in years.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.131
Wouldn't mind
a closer look at that.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.691
All these rooms are padlocked.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.067
(grunts)

16:47.806 --> 16:49.340
No one's been here in a while.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.609
He was here.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.211
Cameron.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.680
He wanted me to find this.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.382
It's iraq.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.850
I don't like this.
We better get out of here.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.619
I agree. Let's go.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.188
(door closes)

17:04.190 --> 17:06.691
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

17:08.627 --> 17:10.695
(tires squealing)

17:16.568 --> 17:17.802
It's got to be verax.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.570
No doubt.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.548
Move it, rice!

17:33.318 --> 17:34.485
Rice:
We got more company!

17:36.388 --> 17:38.056
Shit!

18:05.117 --> 18:07.251
They have martin!
They have martin!

18:09.021 --> 18:11.089
Martin!

18:13.192 --> 18:14.892
Gates:
Where are they?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.094
Maggie:
I'm trying all three lines, sir.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.128
Nobody is responding.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.896
Keep trying.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.199
Maggie:
They wouldn't go dark
without telling us.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.600
Contact local pd.
Get somebody out there fast.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.435
(computer dinging)

18:24.437 --> 18:26.904
Sir, county sheriff is
already responding.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.874
There's reports of shots fired
at that location.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.311
Send tactical backup as well.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.645
Whoa, nelson, this operation
is supposed to be...

18:34.647 --> 18:36.314
Off the books. I know.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.549
Keep it undercover.
Call it a drug investigation.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.318
Actually, sir,
I have crystal on the line.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.719
Crystal, go ahead.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.054
They took him, sir.
They took martin.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.055
Gates:
What happened?

18:44.057 --> 18:45.456
There was nothing at the motel.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.058
No, no.
This was a setup, chief.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.392
100% this was a setup.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.460
These guys came
ready to rock and roll.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.829
This was all about
grabbing martin.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.898
What's their lead time?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.399
Crystal:
Ten minutes, easy.

18:55.401 --> 18:57.568
Spiller:
And we're no closer
to finding cameron.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.070
This is messed up.
This is seriously messed up.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.104
We need to get a ride.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.739
Tactical is on their way.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.807
Hold tight, crystal.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.509
Copy that.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.410
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.483
(elevator bell dings)

19:16.989 --> 19:19.490
Sir, we need to issue a
priority terror alert.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.791
Not yet.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.293
You're putting my agents
in the line of fire

19:22.295 --> 19:23.861
Without any support.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.531
I'll notify dhs. They can raise
the national threat level.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.833
With all due, respect, sir--
that's not good enough.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.934
We've lost martin odum.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.502
This is still a covert action.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.305
John cameron remains
our suspect.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.773
They need to find him
and do it now.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.808
I need mcguire and rice
looking for martin,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.844
Not chasing
some vague intel.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.546
Not your call, nelson.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.714
I will go to director bennett
if I have to.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.853
We're too exposed here.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.688
Let's head back
to the motel.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.056
That's the second time
they tried grabbing him.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.525
Why is that?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.793
I don't know.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.295
This guy's been
one fun-house mirror

19:57.297 --> 19:58.729
After another,
and you don't know?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.465
That's funny.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.367
He takes off to houston,
blows the place up.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.037
Then he comes back...
And everybody just shrugs.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.306
Yeah, okay.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.975
Okay, well, I'll tell you what.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.077
I am done
with this team-playing shit.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.345
Almost got killed, okay?

20:14.347 --> 20:15.913
I need to know what's going on.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.481
No more secrets.

20:17.483 --> 20:20.084
Who the hell is martin odum?

20:30.495 --> 20:32.563
(men shouting)

20:35.867 --> 20:37.935
(tires squealing)

20:40.739 --> 20:41.906
Martin:
Who are you?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.475
Who are you? Verax.

20:52.017 --> 20:55.019
Where are you taking me?

20:55.021 --> 20:57.421
(helicopter blades whirring)

21:00.025 --> 21:02.360
(door squeaks shut)

21:06.598 --> 21:08.699
(helicopter blade whirring)

21:12.571 --> 21:15.006
(chains clinking)
(gasps)

21:21.980 --> 21:24.982
Thirsty?

21:24.984 --> 21:27.618
(panting)

21:27.620 --> 21:30.888
Fbi did a hell
of a job hiding you.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.723
I've been looking for you
for ten years.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.292
We almost caught up
with you

21:34.294 --> 21:36.527
In that hospital in germany,
but you slipped out.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.899
<i>I'm guessing you had help.</i>

21:41.901 --> 21:44.168
Who are you?
I'm your wife.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.569
<i>Your medical file said,</i>

21:45.571 --> 21:46.904
Traumatic brain injury,

21:46.906 --> 21:48.472
Severe memory loss.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.241
Some kind of dissociative fugue.

21:50.243 --> 21:54.245
Hell, there was so much chemical
in the air, I'm not surprised.

21:54.247 --> 21:55.846
You probably don't remember me.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.848
Oh, yeah.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.984
I know who you are.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.821
Jason shaw. Verax.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.090
I used to work for you in iraq.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.360
Yes, you did.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.830
Till I found out
you were a spy for mi6.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.534
Then I almost put a bullet
in your head.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.870
Oh, you want another bite
of the apple?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.505
Is that why I'm here?

22:21.507 --> 22:25.109
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.612
Where's cameron?
Where's the target?

22:30.482 --> 22:32.283
Let's go, fellas.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.952
Stay the hell away from me.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.654
Stay the hell
away from me!

22:36.656 --> 22:38.923
(grunting)

22:42.694 --> 22:44.862
(martin groaning)

22:46.498 --> 22:48.566
(groaning)

22:52.971 --> 22:55.506
What did you give me?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.208
(echoing):
Huh?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.743
(sighs)

22:58.745 --> 23:00.878
Sodium thiopental.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.749
I need you to cooperate.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.151
This is about iraq.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.853
You stole money.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.087
You covered it up.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.723
You killed american soldiers.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.925
Centcomm was pissing it away.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.762
Pacification funds, my ass.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.831
<i>That money was funding</i>
<i>the insurgency.</i>

23:20.833 --> 23:23.734
(indistinct chatter)

23:23.736 --> 23:28.539
<i>We made a calculated decision</i>
<i>to repurpose those funds.</i>

23:28.541 --> 23:31.108
<i>The subterfuge</i>
<i>wouldn't hold...</i>

23:31.110 --> 23:32.510
(gunshot)

23:32.512 --> 23:34.245
<i>...If the soldiers had lived.</i>

23:36.114 --> 23:40.017
Martin:
<i>You murdered those soldiers.</i>

23:40.019 --> 23:41.919
They were casualties of war.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.687
And they died with honor.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.556
Not like you.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.691
End of day,
we took home almost

23:47.693 --> 23:49.727
A billion dollars in cash.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.596
You were there,
too, martin.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.232
<i>You could have stopped it,</i>
<i>but you didn't.</i>

23:55.234 --> 23:57.435
<i>You watched them die.</i>

24:00.038 --> 24:02.473
<i>I could tell it bothered you.</i>

24:02.475 --> 24:04.708
<i>Later, we caught you</i>
<i>taking photos of the money.</i>

24:04.710 --> 24:07.077
(groaning)
<i>so, we beat the truth</i>
<i>out of you.</i>

24:07.079 --> 24:08.746
Tell me who
you're working for.
I work for you.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.714
For verax.
(grunting)

24:10.716 --> 24:12.616
Who are you?
Cia, mi6?

24:12.618 --> 24:14.485
(panting)

24:14.487 --> 24:16.287
Defense intelligence?
You're insane.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.222
(laughs)

24:18.224 --> 24:21.158
I've been helping you
steal american dollars.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.160
(laughs)
(grunting)
(groaning)

24:25.330 --> 24:26.897
Go to hell.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.066
Shaw:
<i>We finally broke you.</i>
<i>You admitted</i>

24:29.068 --> 24:30.501
That you were mi6.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.970
And you were about
to expose our biggest score.

24:32.972 --> 24:38.309
<i>That we had saddam's</i>
<i>weapons of mass destruction.</i>

24:38.311 --> 24:40.911
We found the wmd
outside of basra

24:40.913 --> 24:42.813
In a village
that had been abandoned.

24:44.683 --> 24:47.918
<i>Found more in the bunkers</i>
<i>around the village.</i>

24:47.920 --> 24:51.655
<i>Sarin, anthrax, about 20 tons</i>
<i>of weaponized agent.</i>

24:51.657 --> 24:55.526
<i>Yellow cake uranium.</i>

24:55.528 --> 24:57.027
It was all there.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.830
Saddam's wmd.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.765
The ones that didn't exist.

25:01.767 --> 25:04.768
And we had planned
to keep it that way.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.438
What value was the wmd to you?

25:07.440 --> 25:11.108
Insurance, leverage.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.311
A means to check power.
Or escalate the war?

25:14.313 --> 25:17.281
Isn't that what you wanted?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.817
War means profit.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.386
Chaos means profit.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.722
But it wasn't just
about the money.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.657
Then what?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.659
This country's
falling apart, martin.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.294
Who's going
to save it? You?

25:30.296 --> 25:33.063
Power isn't free.
It comes at a price.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.967
And what about
operation raining fire?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.869
I actually have you
to thank for that.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.205
We were getting ready

25:41.207 --> 25:42.573
To move it all
when the bombs hit.

25:42.575 --> 25:46.143
Your pal evans from the oil rig
<i>got you out.</i>

25:46.145 --> 25:48.879
Man, they put
a beatdown on you, huh?
What are you doing?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.581
Roughnecks got to watch
out for each other.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.583
Come on, before
they come back.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.818
You get out of here.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.421
As far as you can go.

25:57.423 --> 25:59.924
Shaw:
<i>The night we were planning</i>
<i>to move the weapons,</i>

25:59.926 --> 26:02.393
<i>You escaped.</i>

26:08.033 --> 26:09.600
(touch tones beeping)

26:10.869 --> 26:14.171
Any allied air patrol, this is
a priority fire mission.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.673
Please respond.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.675
Request immediate air strike.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.344
Eastern perimeter all clear.
Perimeter all clear.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.845
We think he's still in camp.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.048
Heading westward now.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.584
Man:
Unidentified operator,
this is echo one actual.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.185
Please identify.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.854
Authorization tango
niner five zero.

26:30.856 --> 26:34.058
I repeat,
tango niner five zero.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.961
What is your position, tango?

26:37.629 --> 26:40.230
(speaking indistinctly)

26:40.232 --> 26:44.635
Coordinates... 30.21
by 19.7.

26:44.637 --> 26:47.304
Tango,
that's a friendly position.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.239
Request immediate air strike!

26:49.241 --> 26:51.709
I need everything you've got.
Broken arrow!

26:51.711 --> 26:53.210
Broken arrow? Say again.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.778
That's a friendly position.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.080
If you don't listen to me,

26:56.082 --> 26:57.881
There's gonna be a hell
of a lot more people dead!

26:57.883 --> 26:59.216
Kill the satcom.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.452
No communications
outside of camp.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.554
I say again, a broken arrow.

27:03.556 --> 27:06.123
(grunts)

27:08.059 --> 27:09.393
(grunting)

27:09.395 --> 27:11.261
(grunts, panting)

27:11.263 --> 27:14.064
You're just
a bunch of thieves.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.634
If you're gonna do it, do it.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.102
(gun chamber cocks)

27:18.104 --> 27:19.470
(airplane soaring)

27:19.472 --> 27:22.473
(explosions)

27:33.585 --> 27:35.653
(explosions)

27:45.497 --> 27:48.599
I called in the air strike.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.101
(garbled radio transmission)

27:53.304 --> 27:55.372
(keyboard keys clacking)

28:02.947 --> 28:05.883
Operation raining fire was meant
for an iraqi military site

28:05.885 --> 28:07.451
40 klicks north of us.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.787
You called broken arrow,
brought them to us instead.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.722
Took courage
to do what you did.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.724
You knew you'd probably die.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.694
I respect that sense
of sacrifice.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.297
You killed a lot
of my men that night.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.899
Came up one short.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.967
The bomb burned the shirt
off my back.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.736
Most of my skin, too.

28:25.738 --> 28:27.871
Shockwave collapsed
my left lung.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.406
You were safe in the hole.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.309
Getting blown off that hill
saved my ass.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.079
I was one of the lucky ones.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.548
I guess cameron
got lucky, too.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.451
Man:
Sir, we're ready.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.188
(beeping and trilling)

28:44.190 --> 28:45.823
Martin:
What are you doing?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.225
Scanning a high-res
image of your face.

28:48.227 --> 28:52.196
(beeping and chirping)

28:52.198 --> 28:55.566
Martin:
You still haven't
answered my question.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.335
Why am I here?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.671
(recording):
You still haven't answered
my question.

29:00.673 --> 29:02.673
Why am I here?

29:02.675 --> 29:04.541
The future of war is psyops.

29:04.543 --> 29:07.344
Strength through intelligence,
outthinking your enemy.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.113
Controlling belief.
(phone ringing)

29:09.115 --> 29:10.948
Man:
Are we a go?

29:10.950 --> 29:13.250
Affirmative.
I want sniper in position.

29:17.455 --> 29:20.023
Who's the target?
Someone who can't seem
to get with the program.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.793
Unfortunately, we have
to deal with the situation.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.531
With an assassination?

29:27.533 --> 29:29.800
They'll catch you.

29:32.036 --> 29:35.372
Not if they're looking
for john cameron.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.807
You think john cameron

29:36.809 --> 29:38.275
Is some elusive operative?

29:38.277 --> 29:39.810
<i>He's been in the shadows</i>

29:39.812 --> 29:42.212
<i>All this years</i>
<i>because he</i> is <i>a shadow.</i>

29:42.214 --> 29:44.114
I talked to him.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.316
You talked to me.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.985
<i>It's the only way</i>
<i>I could bring you in.</i>

29:47.987 --> 29:49.553
You want to know
who you are?

29:49.555 --> 29:50.954
(grunting)

29:50.956 --> 29:52.956
What's your name?

29:52.958 --> 29:54.725
Go to hell.

29:54.727 --> 29:55.926
Martin odum?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.094
What's your name?

29:57.096 --> 29:58.729
Dante auerbach?

29:58.731 --> 29:59.997
Try again. What's your name?

29:59.999 --> 30:01.265
I've told you.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.933
Len barlow.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.401
(grunts)

30:04.403 --> 30:05.569
Cameron.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.638
John cameron.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.908
Cameron was your legend in iraq.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.910
You left it behind
when the bombs fell.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.345
That's not possible.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.915
(gunshot)
shaw:
<i>As far as the fbi's concerned,</i>

30:17.917 --> 30:20.484
<i>Cameron killed those soldiers</i>
<i>after we took that cash.</i>

30:20.486 --> 30:21.652
Martin:
<i>That's not true.</i>

30:21.654 --> 30:23.120
You did it.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.354
(clicks, gunshot)

30:27.091 --> 30:28.158
You murdered them.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.500
Man (over radio):
Adjusting the...

30:36.502 --> 30:38.101
15 mile-per-hour crosswind.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.637
Target is in sight.

30:40.639 --> 30:41.939
I make the truth.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.540
I define belief.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.676
And moments from now,
the bureau is gonna believe

30:45.678 --> 30:47.177
You pulled the trigger

30:47.179 --> 30:49.012
<i>And killed dayle bennett,</i>
<i>director of the fbi.</i>

30:50.315 --> 30:51.415
This is your homecoming.

30:52.717 --> 30:53.917
Welcome back, john.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.653
Take the shot.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.622
No!

30:58.624 --> 31:00.858
(grunts)

31:05.063 --> 31:08.131
Sir, martin's cell phone
has come back online.

31:08.133 --> 31:11.702
I'm sending his location
to rice and crystal now.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.637
(distant siren wailing)

31:13.639 --> 31:15.806
Rice:
<i>On our way.</i>

31:15.808 --> 31:17.474
<i>Eta: Five minutes.</i>

31:17.476 --> 31:19.376
(distant siren wailing)

31:22.013 --> 31:24.081
(metallic banging)

31:25.817 --> 31:27.651
Oh, my god.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.253
Sir, lapd
is responding

31:29.255 --> 31:31.822
To a shooting
at the federal building

31:31.824 --> 31:35.192
In westwood-- that's
right across the street
from martin's location.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.928
Alert crystal
and rice.

31:39.197 --> 31:41.265
(distant siren wailing)

31:45.770 --> 31:48.005
(panting)

31:50.375 --> 31:52.276
It says director bennett's
been shot.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.510
What?
A sniper shot him

31:53.512 --> 31:54.578
Through the window.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.914
(distant siren wailing)

32:03.755 --> 32:05.756
Put the gun down, martin.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.292
I didn't fire it.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.526
Then who did?

32:09.528 --> 32:10.961
Shaw was here.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.196
How'd you find me?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.431
Your phone
got turned on.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.565
We traced it.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.267
Of course.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.803
Just like he wanted you to.

32:19.805 --> 32:22.272
They set me up.

32:24.142 --> 32:25.776
Martin, put the gun down.

32:31.049 --> 32:33.150
You need
to get out of here.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.551
Get deputy spiller on the line.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.320
(static crackling)
yes, sir.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.821
Gates:
What's happening?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.256
I don't know.
They're attacking
our servers.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.924
(over speakers):
My name is martin odum.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.393
My name used to be john cameron.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.395
I'm a covert operative
in the fbi.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.898
Tonight I claim responsibility

32:47.900 --> 32:50.133
For the killing
of fbi director dayle bennett.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.736
He was an enemy to his country.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.738
You'll call me crazy.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.074
You'll try to discredit me.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.910
But you'll not silence me.

32:59.912 --> 33:03.380
I pulled the trigger
knowing what I was doing.

33:05.483 --> 33:08.685
I did it to stop us all
from going over the cliff.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.759
Martin:
Director bennett was a traitor,

33:15.761 --> 33:17.828
A man bent on desecrating
the constitution.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.597
A man who ran a secret police,
a political police,

33:20.599 --> 33:23.433
No different
from the stasi or the cheka.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.103
A hypocrite
who violated our liberty

33:26.105 --> 33:28.505
While hiding behind
the flag and the patriot act.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.875
America must wake up.
We now live
(knocking)

33:31.877 --> 33:32.876
In a fascist state.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.277
Nelson.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.113
Gates:
This video,

33:36.115 --> 33:37.681
I find it hard to believe.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.982
Fortunately, it was only sent

33:38.984 --> 33:41.018
To about a hundred
senior bureau personnel.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.720
That passes as good news?
Well, the video was
immediately classified.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.956
The situation is contained.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.891
I'm sure you'd agree
the bureau doesn't need

33:47.893 --> 33:49.693
A scandal compounding
this tragedy.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.328
I'm sorry, who is that?

33:51.330 --> 33:53.296
I'm conrad tomlin.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.399
National security council.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.969
He's here to help us
manage the crisis, nelson.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.505
Meaning what?
Coordinate the investigation.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.306
Help transition
the leadership of the bureau.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.642
Didn't realize the president
already had someone in mind.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.114
Deputy spiller's going
to be the acting director.

34:13.317 --> 34:15.318
It's about stability.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.653
I have to know

34:16.655 --> 34:18.722
If I can count on you
to bring odum to justice.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.390
Martin odum is not responsible

34:20.392 --> 34:21.725
For killing director bennett.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.893
That is not
our position, nelson.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.261
But it is mine.

34:25.530 --> 34:27.898
Tomlin:
Well, perhaps you can
explain to us how odum

34:27.900 --> 34:30.000
Escaped custody.

34:30.002 --> 34:31.234
If this turns into a scandal,

34:31.236 --> 34:33.103
Someone is going to have
to take the responsibility.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.337
Meaning me?

34:34.339 --> 34:35.405
I would see this as

34:35.407 --> 34:36.473
An opportunity to step up.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.010
Otherwise...

34:41.245 --> 34:42.579
...You'll be stepping down.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.083
Crystal: <i>As explained</i>
<i>in my report, senator,</i>

34:46.085 --> 34:47.751
We have found no evidence

34:47.753 --> 34:49.352
Directly linking
special agent odum

34:49.354 --> 34:50.587
To the assassination.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.622
Except for the, uh,
videotaped confession

34:52.624 --> 34:55.192
He sent to his own
superiors at the fbi

34:55.194 --> 34:56.293
11 days ago.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.361
What else do you need,
agent mcguire?

34:58.363 --> 35:00.530
We believe the video
has been coerced,

35:00.532 --> 35:02.566
If not a complete fabrication.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.734
That's, uh...
That's bold conjecture.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.069
This-this was in your report.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.404
Yes, sir.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.072
So you're saying
that the video's a fake.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.408
You think it was made
without his cooperation?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.076
I, uh... (chuckles)

35:13.078 --> 35:14.544
I find that terribly
hard to believe.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.745
We believe the technology

35:15.747 --> 35:16.980
Has been developed...
Special agent
mcguire,

35:16.982 --> 35:18.648
I'm gonna say this right now:

35:18.650 --> 35:20.117
I admire your loyalty
to a fellow agent,

35:20.119 --> 35:21.251
But I need to remind you

35:21.253 --> 35:23.386
That you're under oath,
sitting here.

35:23.388 --> 35:25.388
The fact remains that
martin odum

35:25.390 --> 35:26.590
Is troubled.

35:26.592 --> 35:27.791
He, uh...

35:27.793 --> 35:30.560
He failed five
psych evaluations.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.662
He was deemed
unstable,

35:32.664 --> 35:34.431
Antagonistic
and evasive.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.600
And yet, he was repeatedly

35:36.602 --> 35:38.235
Put into the field

35:38.237 --> 35:39.569
As a deep cover
operative.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.071
His own psychiatrist
says, uh...

35:41.073 --> 35:43.607
Agent odum may not be able to...

35:43.609 --> 35:46.977
"tell his legends
from his own life."

35:49.180 --> 35:51.848
I think a more likely
scenario is, uh...

35:51.850 --> 35:53.016
Is that he snapped.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.918
The person in that video

35:54.920 --> 35:56.820
Is not the agent that I knew

35:56.822 --> 35:58.455
And served with
in the field, sir.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.590
I'm highly skeptical of that.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.791
Verax has employed robust

36:01.793 --> 36:03.193
<i>Psyops operations</i>
<i>since the iraq war.</i>

36:03.195 --> 36:04.828
<i>I mean, they've invested</i>

36:04.830 --> 36:06.596
Heavily in digital
spy technologies.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.099
My report includes
detailed evidence

36:09.101 --> 36:11.201
Of verax's suspected involvement

36:11.203 --> 36:13.270
In operation raining fire...
Gorman:
I don't see

36:13.272 --> 36:15.672
How a classified
friendly fire report

36:15.674 --> 36:17.174
Is any indication
of a smoking gun.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.475
Verax and the u.S. Military

36:18.477 --> 36:19.943
Have tried to cover up
the incident...

36:19.945 --> 36:22.279
And that sounds like a lot
of conspiracy nonsense to me,

36:22.281 --> 36:23.713
Agent.
I only wish it was.

36:23.715 --> 36:24.714
The verax
corporation

36:24.716 --> 36:26.283
Has served this country

36:26.285 --> 36:27.884
With honor and distinction.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.686
Jason shaw is a patriot

36:29.688 --> 36:30.954
And a personal friend of mine.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.622
I'm not going
to sit here

36:32.624 --> 36:33.790
And listen
to you

36:33.792 --> 36:35.959
Slander his good name
in a weak attempt

36:35.961 --> 36:37.727
To exculpate martin odum,

36:37.729 --> 36:39.629
A man who has
betrayed this country

36:39.631 --> 36:40.897
Time and time again.

36:40.899 --> 36:44.167
I can only hope the fbi
brings this fugitive

36:44.169 --> 36:45.702
<i>To justice.</i>

36:57.248 --> 36:59.216
Didn't know if you
could make it.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.184
Can't be too careful
these days.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.819
How you doing?

37:02.821 --> 37:04.387
I'm all right.
Just keeping

37:04.389 --> 37:05.555
My head down.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.623
Check the seat pocket.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.266
Did you reach out to mi6?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.667
(sniffs)

37:17.669 --> 37:20.003
My contact told me that they
have no official knowledge

37:20.005 --> 37:21.504
Of an agent named john cameron.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.673
Unofficially,

37:23.675 --> 37:25.508
He told me "john
cameron" was a legend

37:25.510 --> 37:27.344
And that you've
been disavowed.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.180
Fear of associating with
a suspected terrorist.

37:30.182 --> 37:32.215
By now they've probably
erased every trace

37:32.217 --> 37:33.550
Of your time at mi6.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.119
But... We'll find
another way.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.355
(chuckles darkly)

37:38.357 --> 37:40.991
Strange thing,
not knowing your own name.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.194
Hey.

37:44.196 --> 37:45.528
Thanks for these.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.431
You see who they're going
to make acting director?

37:48.433 --> 37:49.532
Spiller.

37:49.534 --> 37:50.533
Mm-hmm.

37:50.535 --> 37:51.868
I should've seen it coming.

37:51.870 --> 37:52.869
He served me up.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.137
He's an old pro.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.305
He had a price; we paid for it.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.741
Dco is officially closed.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.876
Does that mean you're out?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.911
Nah, I'm still in.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.413
They put me at a desk.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.414
Keeping me close,

38:04.416 --> 38:05.448
Making sure I keep
my mouth shut.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.051
Looks like
I'm undercover now, too.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.220
Watch your step, nelson.

38:10.222 --> 38:12.122
Martin... I'm here.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.591
When you need me,

38:14.593 --> 38:16.226
I'm here.

38:16.228 --> 38:18.228
Keep an eye on my family.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.396
I'll be in touch.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.567
Spiller:
<i>I, nicholas b. Spiller,</i>
<i>do solemnly swear</i>

38:24.569 --> 38:26.102
<i>To support and defend</i>

38:26.104 --> 38:27.570
<i>The constitution</i>
<i>of the United States</i>

38:27.572 --> 38:29.139
Against all enemies,

38:29.141 --> 38:30.640
Both foreign and domestic,

38:30.642 --> 38:33.343
And that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.845
I take this obligation freely,

38:35.847 --> 38:38.782
Without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion;

38:38.784 --> 38:40.984
And that I will well
and faithfully discharge

38:40.986 --> 38:43.820
The duties of the office upon
which I am about to enter.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.588
So help me god.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.257
(applause)

38:47.259 --> 38:49.092
Crystal:
<i>Sir, I took an oath</i>
<i>to defend this country.</i>

38:49.094 --> 38:51.361
I believe in the mission
of the fbi.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.763
Today, that mission
is being compromised

38:53.765 --> 38:55.699
Due to certain elements
within the bureau

38:55.701 --> 38:57.634
That are more loyal
to private interests

38:57.636 --> 38:59.135
Than to
public good.

38:59.137 --> 39:00.837
I stand by my statements.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.005
Gorman:
Well, that's fine,
agent.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.873
I'd also like to go
on record myself

39:03.875 --> 39:06.710
By stating that I fully
support the closure

39:06.712 --> 39:08.645
Of the division of
covert operations.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.447
Sir, the dco has been
instrumental

39:10.449 --> 39:12.782
In stopping dozens of attacks
against this country.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.984
Except for the assassination
of your own

39:14.986 --> 39:16.886
Fbi's director.
I would call that

39:16.888 --> 39:17.887
A notable failure,

39:17.889 --> 39:20.123
Wouldn't you,
agent mcguire?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.158
This nation is faced
by myriad threats,

39:22.160 --> 39:23.626
Both from foreign agents

39:23.628 --> 39:25.795
And from evil traitors
hiding within.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.797
As acting director of the fbi,

39:27.799 --> 39:30.400
My greatest responsibility
to the american people

39:30.402 --> 39:32.068
Is for their safety
and security.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.404
And so my first
and foremost priority

39:34.406 --> 39:36.539
Will be to bring
the assassin of my predecessor

39:36.541 --> 39:38.308
Swiftly to justice.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.377
â™ª grab your gloves

39:41.545 --> 39:44.614
â™ª and say good-bye
to the ones you love â™ª

39:47.518 --> 39:48.918
â™ª before too long

39:51.822 --> 39:54.124
â™ª you'll be dead and gone

39:56.160 --> 39:58.228
â™ª a sad song

40:00.498 --> 40:03.066
â™ª won't save you
from the things you've done â™ª

40:05.870 --> 40:08.772
â™ª save your breaths

40:08.774 --> 40:11.841
â™ª you haven't many left

40:14.178 --> 40:16.012
â™ª well, I don't know

40:19.216 --> 40:21.284
â™ª if you believe in god

40:23.854 --> 40:25.622
â™ª but either way...

40:25.624 --> 40:27.690
Agent mcguire, who killed
director bennett?

40:27.692 --> 40:30.560
(reporters shouting questions)

40:30.562 --> 40:31.861
Did the fbi drop the ball?

40:31.863 --> 40:33.596
(reporters shouting questions)

40:34.565 --> 40:37.200
Have you identified
a suspect?

40:37.202 --> 40:39.269
â™ª in silence underground

40:41.205 --> 40:44.641
â™ª in silence underground

40:46.477 --> 40:49.212
â™ª in silence underground

40:50.781 --> 40:53.283
â™ª rising sun

40:54.318 --> 40:57.620
â™ª wipe the dust off
of your gun â™ª

41:00.057 --> 41:01.858
â™ª the whistle blows

41:04.094 --> 41:08.164
â™ª down the track to mexico

41:09.767 --> 41:12.001
â™ª never found

41:13.404 --> 41:17.140
â™ª gettin' used to the sound

41:18.843 --> 41:20.710
â™ª only stillness

41:22.413 --> 41:24.647
â™ª in silence underground

41:27.151 --> 41:30.487
â™ª in silence underground

41:31.856 --> 41:35.692
â™ª in silence underground.
