Who cares about the Brain Squad?

00:11.567 --> 00:13.700

I'm part of something

00:13.800 --> 00:15.533
that's much bigger
than just myself.

00:15.633 --> 00:17.067
Only humans are on teams,

00:17.167 --> 00:20.533

Dayton Reyes, please.

00:26.433 --> 00:29.100

00:29.200 --> 00:32.133

reason was poor construction.

An escaping electron
short-circuited my system.

You are my...BFF.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.133

she's malfunctioning?

00:56.233 --> 00:58.600
- Her defiant behavior.
You said so yourself.

00:58.700 --> 01:01.667
She spray-painted the school.
- That's what the school says.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.233
- You don't think
it could be her?

01:03.333 --> 01:06.067
I don't need to remind you
that this has happened before.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.067
- Frankie is not Eliza.

01:08.133 --> 01:09.900
I fixed those flaws
when I coded her

01:10.067 --> 01:11.833
and I put in
a lot of safeguards.

01:11.933 --> 01:15.767
Besides, we have a special bond.
Frankie tells me everything.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.067

Bye, Dr. Gaines.

was coming over today.

Don't give me that look.

defiant behavior,

having friends over.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.400
Then she stops following
simple commands.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.267
The next thing you know,
she's an international criminal.

01:33.367 --> 01:35.333
- Don't be so dramatic, James.

01:35.433 --> 01:36.933
If I thought Frankie
was a threat,

01:37.067 --> 01:38.400
it would be a different story.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.900
- It's classic
escalation behavior.

01:42.067 --> 01:44.067

01:45.133 --> 01:46.967

01:47.067 --> 01:50.267
It's one of my business.
Probably nothing.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.500
It's just that we as scientists
should try to make the world

a more dangerous one.

you're holding is artificial.

- I-- I kind of figured it out.
And then she told me.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.567
- That's the most important
command I ever gave her

21:57.667 --> 21:58.800
and she told you?

21:58.900 --> 22:00.667
- Can we please talk
about this later?

22:00.767 --> 22:02.067
You have to fix her!

22:02.133 --> 22:03.333
- I hate to say this,

22:03.433 --> 22:06.333
but it may be for the best
that we don't fix Frankie.
