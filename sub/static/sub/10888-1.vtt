WEBVTT

00:07.784 --> 00:08.744
Right.

00:10.104 --> 00:11.264
I'm Electra.

00:14.744 --> 00:16.344
Are you one of them?

00:19.304 --> 00:20.744
Was.

00:21.944 --> 00:22.944
Retired.

00:24.344 --> 00:26.184
I don't believe you.

00:28.824 --> 00:29.984
I told you...

00:30.664 --> 00:32.584
...if I wanted to kill you...

00:32.744 --> 00:34.384
...I would have already.

00:41.864 --> 00:43.264
Look what she did.

00:43.904 --> 00:45.224
It's not loaded?

00:49.464 --> 00:51.304
It's loaded. It's silenced.

00:52.904 --> 00:54.024
Just shoot.

00:55.904 --> 00:57.144
I could.

00:57.384 --> 00:59.864
I'd be 500 miles away
before they found you.

01:00.704 --> 01:01.944
How's that?

01:08.424 --> 01:10.184
Stop! She doesn't like it!

01:11.384 --> 01:14.144
I say she's afraid she might hit you.

01:20.904 --> 01:22.024
Sorry I have the gun?

01:22.104 --> 01:25.184
You think it was a mistake?
You think I'm scared?

01:27.384 --> 01:28.784
You don't know me!

01:29.504 --> 01:30.504
Shut up!

01:33.064 --> 01:35.304
Today was supposed to be a good day.

01:35.464 --> 01:36.704
Payday.

01:36.824 --> 01:39.944
40 grand.
I was going to buy Pearl a boyfriend.

01:41.864 --> 01:43.624
Now two people are dead.

01:45.824 --> 01:47.624
I'm in way over my head.

01:48.744 --> 01:50.144
I just want out.

01:51.224 --> 01:53.784
You got the gun. The key's on the dresser.

01:53.984 --> 01:54.944
Go.

01:56.384 --> 01:59.664
I don't have a social security number,
or a driver's license.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.144
I barely remember my real name.

02:02.824 --> 02:04.824
I'm a ghost. I'm nobody.

02:05.024 --> 02:06.264
I'll disappear.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.943
I found you. So did he. You can't hide.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.304
I just want my life back.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.384
That's all.

02:22.664 --> 02:23.744
I'm sorry.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.824 --> 02:40.184
I'll take that.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.304
I need to be alone.

02:48.904 --> 02:52.064
I haven't spent this much
time with someone in years.

03:03.624 --> 03:05.064
Neither have I.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.624
Well, the disk....

03:56.984 --> 03:58.784
You'll get it.

04:21.704 --> 04:22.744
Fuck you.

04:30.944 --> 04:32.904
I don't care what you are.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.424
Fuck you!

04:57.384 --> 04:59.544
Then who the hell's Miguel Bain?

05:18.024 --> 05:20.104
Who the hell is Miguel Bain?

05:20.744 --> 05:22.184
Christ.

05:42.704 --> 05:44.864
What'd they say about the shooting?

05:45.024 --> 05:46.024
Nothing.

05:46.224 --> 05:48.464
I don't need details, just in general.

05:48.624 --> 05:50.224
-Nothing.
-Impossible.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.024
Not really. Not if....

05:52.144 --> 05:53.144
If what?

05:53.824 --> 05:55.664
The CIA or Interpol....

05:59.424 --> 06:00.664
What's on this?

06:01.904 --> 06:03.184
It's encrypted.

06:03.344 --> 06:06.944
Breaking the code on my lap top
could take 200 or 300 years.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.064
Aren't you a genius?

06:09.344 --> 06:10.304
I am.

06:10.464 --> 06:13.184
I was the best.
If it was stored electronically, it was mine.

06:13.264 --> 06:14.224
Was?

06:15.664 --> 06:17.584
Yeah, I'm retiring too.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.024
I wish I had an insight...

06:21.184 --> 06:24.624
...but it was anonymous,
an intercepted satellite transmission.

06:24.864 --> 06:27.424
Probably just industrial secrets.

06:31.344 --> 06:32.784
There's one bed.

06:33.104 --> 06:34.944
I guess you noticed that.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.704
-It's yours.
-You want the couch?

06:36.784 --> 06:37.904
No, thanks.

06:44.224 --> 06:46.464
A trick so you don't get comfortable?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.624
Tie a string from your toe to the doorknob.

06:52.064 --> 06:53.504
It opens in.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.064
You wouldn't feel it.

07:00.144 --> 07:02.384
Yeah, I got it. I understand.

07:52.544 --> 07:53.744
Thanks.

07:54.784 --> 07:55.904
For what?

07:56.624 --> 07:57.824
I don't know.

07:58.704 --> 08:00.544
Saving my life, I guess.

08:06.624 --> 08:08.704
How'd you like to make $1 million?

08:09.344 --> 08:10.944
What do I have to do?

08:13.744 --> 08:15.344
Nothing cheap, I hope.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.464
What is it?

08:18.624 --> 08:19.824
Tell you tomorrow.

08:19.904 --> 08:21.184
I can't sleep.

08:21.344 --> 08:22.304
Be patient.

08:22.384 --> 08:23.744
What? Tell me.

08:25.184 --> 08:26.864
Thanks for the chocolate.

08:29.024 --> 08:30.144
Good night.

08:51.584 --> 08:52.944
Forget something?

09:01.984 --> 09:03.344
You be careful.

11:04.744 --> 11:06.504
I'm right here.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.264
What's going on?

11:39.424 --> 11:40.744
I'll move!

12:09.704 --> 12:11.304
I hate that music.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.064
Let's go.

12:16.384 --> 12:18.024
Got it? Is it all there?

12:20.584 --> 12:21.904
What're you doing?

12:21.984 --> 12:22.904
Drive!

12:23.304 --> 12:24.704
Drive, fast!

12:25.504 --> 12:26.984
I mean, fast!

12:30.184 --> 12:31.664
Get off this street!

12:36.384 --> 12:37.544
Stop!

12:41.184 --> 12:42.144
Hit it!

13:00.064 --> 13:01.984
No money, no disk.

13:05.384 --> 13:06.704
What's so funny?

13:07.944 --> 13:10.944
I wasn't sure you'd come back
so I switched the disks.

13:11.104 --> 13:13.224
And all they have is file names.

13:13.384 --> 13:15.264
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

13:15.744 --> 13:18.824
And they got bubkes. Zero, zilch...

13:18.984 --> 13:21.704
...zot, nix, nada, dry hump, squirt...

13:21.864 --> 13:23.224
...diddley-squat.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.024
I read a slang dictionary once.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.344
Keep reading.

13:35.144 --> 13:37.344
Contractor tried to kill you.

13:37.704 --> 13:39.464
That's not good.

13:49.184 --> 13:50.744
I have caviar for you.

13:51.744 --> 13:52.864
Come here.

13:53.704 --> 13:55.144
Good girl.

13:56.584 --> 13:58.984
''Caviar'' is not a Russian word.

13:59.144 --> 14:01.664
Ikra. I think the word is ikra.

14:03.904 --> 14:05.104
How do you know?

14:05.184 --> 14:07.344
I had a Russian friend. He told me.

14:09.064 --> 14:10.344
Had a friend?

14:12.824 --> 14:15.224
About 15 years ago he was taken.

14:17.864 --> 14:19.064
He was killed?

14:30.984 --> 14:33.304
Yes, I'm still alive, you bastard.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.784
Not this time.

14:47.064 --> 14:49.504
Let's see how valuable he thinks this is.

14:51.864 --> 14:53.064
Three million?

14:53.464 --> 14:54.344
Four?

14:56.904 --> 14:57.944
More.

15:05.384 --> 15:07.144
$20 fucking million?

15:14.104 --> 15:17.064
Where do you suppose this
person is right now?

15:17.704 --> 15:18.824
A mile away?

15:18.984 --> 15:20.584
1,000 miles from here?

15:22.824 --> 15:24.824
Never thought about it till now.

15:25.464 --> 15:28.664
You quit your job,
you have thoughts you never had before.

15:28.744 --> 15:30.984
Sounds like a mid-life crisis.

15:35.464 --> 15:36.664
You're right.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.584
Twenty million dollars.

16:09.064 --> 16:10.304
We're partners?

16:21.144 --> 16:22.664
That's $10 million apiece.

16:22.744 --> 16:24.344
8. The bank keeps 20%.

16:24.424 --> 16:26.064
I thought I was a thief.

16:27.784 --> 16:28.744
Passport?

16:28.824 --> 16:30.584
12. Where to?

16:30.984 --> 16:32.344
To the bank.

17:48.824 --> 17:50.584
What happened to the hotel?

17:50.664 --> 17:53.704
They had a fire years ago.
Nobody had money to fix it.

17:55.384 --> 17:56.584
Wait here.

17:59.384 --> 18:01.704
Keep the air on and watch my cat.

18:01.864 --> 18:02.984
You got it.

18:09.224 --> 18:10.744
Is that our bank?

18:10.904 --> 18:12.344
Where our money is?

18:17.064 --> 18:18.344
What's up there?

18:18.504 --> 18:19.544
He'll be.

19:03.264 --> 19:05.064
Hug the wall.

19:05.224 --> 19:06.304
Careful.

19:06.464 --> 19:07.944
Go light.

20:16.464 --> 20:17.504
You okay?

20:23.104 --> 20:26.064
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning,
I'm going in that bank.

20:27.024 --> 20:29.704
He'll be in the plaza somewhere,
in the crowd.

20:30.184 --> 20:33.184
When he sees me go in,
he'll make his move up here.

20:33.744 --> 20:35.704
You'll be in the cafe over there.

20:35.784 --> 20:37.904
You'll see him when he goes inside.

20:38.624 --> 20:39.984
Then we wait.

20:41.664 --> 20:42.784
We wait.

20:43.624 --> 20:46.024
Tomorrow will be a long day for him.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.144
He'll begin to doubt himself.
He'll think he missed me.

20:50.824 --> 20:54.144
He'll want to see whether
I'm still in the bank.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.064
Then it'll be sunset...

20:57.864 --> 20:59.304
...closing time.

21:01.384 --> 21:02.944
He'll get desperate...

21:03.024 --> 21:04.504
...real desperate...

21:05.344 --> 21:07.424
...but he must leave his rifle...

21:08.384 --> 21:09.744
...inside.

21:10.024 --> 21:11.464
He's right-handed.

21:12.184 --> 21:15.144
He won't take a pistol because
the doors have metal detectors...

21:15.224 --> 21:16.904
...and he'll be nervous.

21:20.824 --> 21:22.504
When he's out of sight...

21:22.784 --> 21:24.424
...you come get the rifle.

21:24.504 --> 21:26.744
He'll shoot you before you go in.

21:30.104 --> 21:32.024
He'll wait for the prime shot.

21:34.784 --> 21:36.064
When I come out.

21:38.744 --> 21:40.464
He'll want to see my eyes.

21:47.744 --> 21:49.144
Why're you so sure?

21:52.704 --> 21:54.264
He loves history.

21:55.864 --> 21:57.624
15 years ago...

21:58.424 --> 22:00.024
...in this room...

22:01.944 --> 22:03.584
...in this same window...

22:04.984 --> 22:06.184
...I was here.

22:11.104 --> 22:12.544
Oh, my God.

22:14.744 --> 22:17.144
Your friend, Nicolai. He was taken.

22:21.304 --> 22:22.544
You killed him.

22:53.824 --> 22:54.944
It's fine.

24:03.144 --> 24:04.264
Who is it?

24:04.464 --> 24:05.784
Room service.

24:06.944 --> 24:08.784
I didn't order room service.

24:09.504 --> 24:10.744
I did.

24:13.144 --> 24:15.144
You should tell me these things.

24:22.824 --> 24:24.624
Where should I put the tray?

24:25.224 --> 24:27.064
Over here's fine.

24:32.824 --> 24:34.984
What's going on outside?

24:37.384 --> 24:38.824
The Day of the Dead.

24:39.024 --> 24:40.664
What're the flowers for?

24:40.824 --> 24:44.504
The families make a path from
their homes to the cemetery...

24:44.664 --> 24:46.504
...with the flower petals...

24:46.584 --> 24:50.344
...so the souls of the dead
can find their way home.

24:50.544 --> 24:51.664
That's nice.

24:51.744 --> 24:53.624
Call me anytime for the tray.

25:03.584 --> 25:05.624
Sounds great, huh? Can we go?

25:06.104 --> 25:08.544
No, he's here now. I know he is.

25:09.024 --> 25:10.944
So we're staying in the hotel.

25:11.424 --> 25:13.504
The enemy of fun.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.664
I got you a beer.

26:04.344 --> 26:06.664
I wish I could explain to you why...

26:06.864 --> 26:08.304
...I killed Nicolai.

26:09.304 --> 26:12.024
At the time it was
the right thing to do, but...

26:12.744 --> 26:14.264
...I'm sorry I did it.

26:14.544 --> 26:17.424
It's something I've had to
live with for 15 years.

26:19.064 --> 26:21.624
I used to wish it would happen to me...

26:21.784 --> 26:23.624
...and that'd be my way out.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.104
Permanently.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.944
But not any more.

26:32.184 --> 26:33.784
Not since I met you.

27:29.624 --> 27:31.744
Too bad you don't understand English.

27:31.824 --> 27:35.824
I would like to tell you how wonderful
this cemetery is. It's gorgeous.

27:35.984 --> 27:39.424
I love cemeteries. I really do. I really do.

27:39.824 --> 27:44.464
You're here, the next day you're there.
I put a lot of people down there.

27:45.184 --> 27:47.104
A lot of people down there.

28:32.224 --> 28:33.664
Jasmine.

29:47.824 --> 29:49.104
Jasmine.

29:51.104 --> 29:52.944
It's all over the place.

30:19.304 --> 30:21.224
I just killed your brother.

30:36.344 --> 30:38.264
''Contract has been paid...

30:38.424 --> 30:41.464
''...transferred to the specified account.''

30:43.064 --> 30:45.144
And her disk?

30:48.384 --> 30:50.984
''You'll be advised. Good-bye, Robert.''

30:51.944 --> 30:52.984
Good-bye.

30:54.744 --> 30:56.064
Let's get ready.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.264
Don't lose this.

31:01.344 --> 31:02.624
Two-way?

31:02.784 --> 31:06.584
They saw you coming.
This is a piece of junk.

31:07.224 --> 31:11.064
Tell me when he leaves the hotel,
I'll tell you when he leaves the bank.

31:11.224 --> 31:13.184
-What's this for?
-Just in case.

31:13.464 --> 31:15.944
No. I can't shoot anybody.

31:16.064 --> 31:16.944
I can't.

31:17.024 --> 31:18.464
You almost shot me.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.224
I aimed at the lamp.

31:20.544 --> 31:21.704
Aim at him.

31:25.624 --> 31:27.744
Ever play cowboys and Indians?

31:27.944 --> 31:30.824
-Sure. Everybody did.
-And which were you?

31:31.584 --> 31:32.744
An Indian.

31:33.504 --> 31:36.024
-I was always an Indian.
-Always the Indian.

31:36.384 --> 31:38.224
Just pretend he's a cowboy...

31:38.304 --> 31:39.864
...and pull the trigger.

31:39.944 --> 31:41.864
Then pretend he gets up after.

31:42.104 --> 31:44.024
But you must pull the trigger.

31:44.744 --> 31:46.104
You've got to.

31:48.344 --> 31:50.784
I never depended on anyone in my life.

31:52.224 --> 31:53.744
I'm depending on you.

32:21.824 --> 32:23.704
I don't see him.

32:24.104 --> 32:26.424
I'm looking all around the square.

32:30.424 --> 32:31.784
I'm in the bank.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.504
Where do I go for transfers?

32:40.984 --> 32:42.104
Oh, my God!

32:43.304 --> 32:44.384
He's here.

32:45.024 --> 32:46.744
He's going to the hotel.

32:48.824 --> 32:50.424
He's almost at the door.

32:54.144 --> 32:56.504
He's going in. He's going in.

32:57.144 --> 33:00.584
That's what we wanted.
Relax, try the decaf.

33:00.824 --> 33:04.184
He must be upstairs now.
Should I stay or go in?

33:04.344 --> 33:06.944
No. Stay? Wait, wait. I'll just wait.

33:07.704 --> 33:08.584
It's hot.

33:08.664 --> 33:10.024
Goddamn, it's hot.

33:10.104 --> 33:12.704
I'd rather be out there than in here.

33:15.224 --> 33:16.664
May I help you?

33:16.824 --> 33:18.904
I'm expecting a transfer.

33:48.104 --> 33:50.504
Seòor, we have received your transfer.

33:50.624 --> 33:52.544
I'd like to close the account.

33:52.704 --> 33:53.784
Today?

33:54.104 --> 33:55.424
Close it today?

33:55.584 --> 33:56.984
Right now.

33:57.144 --> 33:59.944
-How would you like the funds?
-American currency.

34:00.704 --> 34:03.944
Would you please step right over there.
I'll be right back.

34:04.024 --> 34:05.144
No problem.

34:40.504 --> 34:41.864
Mr. Rath?

34:43.704 --> 34:46.264
You're aware there may
be a withdrawal fee.

34:46.424 --> 34:47.543
Yes, I am.

34:48.864 --> 34:50.623
This will take some time.

34:51.543 --> 34:53.143
I've got all day.

34:53.504 --> 34:54.744
Take care of him.

34:54.824 --> 34:57.224
Please, follow me. Right this way.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.144
You may sit right here.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.064
Relax. We'll get you some coffee.

35:31.824 --> 35:33.624
What are you doing there?

35:51.184 --> 35:52.344
Fuck!

36:31.224 --> 36:32.344
Talk to me.

36:32.664 --> 36:35.704
No sign of him.
He's just sitting up there, same as us.

36:35.984 --> 36:39.664
I mean, talk to me.
Tell me some of that weird stuff you know.

36:39.984 --> 36:41.584
Tell you weird stuff.

36:42.264 --> 36:43.304
Like what?

36:43.384 --> 36:44.784
Tell me ajoke.

36:46.384 --> 36:47.344
May I?

36:47.704 --> 36:48.784
Sure.

36:49.944 --> 36:51.984
Tell me something to distract me.

36:54.424 --> 36:56.144
I'm not getting paid.

36:56.304 --> 36:57.784
Be generous.

36:58.264 --> 37:00.024
Once upon a time...

37:00.944 --> 37:02.824
...there was a little sparrow...

37:02.904 --> 37:05.864
...who, while flying south for the winter,
froze solid...

37:05.944 --> 37:07.664
...and fell to the ground.

37:07.864 --> 37:10.424
To make matters worse,
a cow crapped on him.

37:10.744 --> 37:13.264
But the manure was warm
and defrosted him.

37:13.424 --> 37:17.944
So there he is, warm and happy to
be alive and he starts to sing.

37:18.104 --> 37:19.824
A cat comes along...

37:19.984 --> 37:23.144
...and he clears off the manure
and eats the little bird.

37:23.984 --> 37:26.224
The moral of the story is this:

37:26.384 --> 37:29.784
Everyone who craps on you is
not necessarily your enemy...

37:29.944 --> 37:32.464
...and everyone who gets you out of crap...

37:32.664 --> 37:35.024
...is not necessarily your friend.

37:35.184 --> 37:37.144
And if you're warm and happy...

37:37.424 --> 37:40.464
...no matter where you are,
keep your big mouth shut.

37:44.424 --> 37:45.624
You like that?

38:01.664 --> 38:04.544
I think I'm running out of stories.

38:04.744 --> 38:06.904
Keep your eye on that building.

38:07.064 --> 38:08.984
He must be getting impatient.

38:09.144 --> 38:10.824
He'll make his move soon.

38:12.904 --> 38:14.544
Thanks for the stories.

38:40.104 --> 38:42.344
Sorry I've been taking up the table.

38:42.504 --> 38:44.344
Thank you. Thank you.

38:57.144 --> 38:59.544
Fuck! Shit! Motherfucker!

39:00.024 --> 39:01.864
Fuck! Shit!

39:13.344 --> 39:16.424
We have deducted our fee and
are making a second count.

39:16.544 --> 39:19.064
The funds will be available in a half hour.

39:19.304 --> 39:21.224
I hope you are comfortable.

41:01.904 --> 41:03.584
Oh, my God. He's coming.

41:03.744 --> 41:04.784
He's coming.

41:04.864 --> 41:06.384
He waited longer than I did.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.584
Here he is.

41:09.344 --> 41:10.224
Go.

41:14.944 --> 41:17.424
-I have your property.
-Be right there.

41:21.424 --> 41:22.624
Where are you?

41:23.024 --> 41:24.864
I'm here in room 303.

41:26.864 --> 41:28.544
The rifle should be on the right.

41:28.624 --> 41:31.824
If so, the gun is going to be right here.

41:32.224 --> 41:33.024
It's not.

41:33.104 --> 41:34.464
What's happening?

41:37.024 --> 41:38.224
It's not here.

41:38.544 --> 41:39.824
Listen to me.

41:40.144 --> 41:41.304
Get out now.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.704
Damn it.

41:46.864 --> 41:49.024
Forget the rifle. Get out.

42:00.544 --> 42:01.744
Have you left?

42:06.944 --> 42:07.984
Found it!

42:51.904 --> 42:53.824
Damn hot day, isn't it?

42:53.944 --> 42:55.264
Scorcher.

42:59.584 --> 43:00.824
I got it.

43:07.824 --> 43:09.104
Tell me...

43:11.184 --> 43:12.944
...how did you know?

43:13.984 --> 43:15.704
Who the hell taught you?

43:16.504 --> 43:17.744
History.

43:18.064 --> 43:19.064
Nicolai.

43:20.344 --> 43:23.664
15 years ago I walked into
this bank just like you.

43:23.824 --> 43:25.344
That makes you good...

43:25.424 --> 43:27.144
...because I was the best.

43:28.504 --> 43:30.224
Now you feel like a mark.

43:30.384 --> 43:32.224
You think you were sold out.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.544
Don't know who to trust.

43:35.344 --> 43:36.824
And you, anticuado?

43:38.224 --> 43:39.264
Who do you trust?

43:39.344 --> 43:40.384
No one.

43:40.504 --> 43:42.424
You're alone. Same as me.

43:49.144 --> 43:50.544
I don't have it!

43:51.984 --> 43:53.504
I don't have the gun.

43:58.384 --> 44:00.144
Why the sunglasses, kid?

44:00.544 --> 44:02.264
Afraid I'll see your eyes?

44:04.184 --> 44:06.064
Just between you and me...

44:07.384 --> 44:08.624
...I'm nervous.

44:14.704 --> 44:16.544
I have $16 million in there.

44:18.904 --> 44:21.064
This is where we can change history.

44:21.184 --> 44:22.344
Our history.

44:23.704 --> 44:25.704
I'm willing to give it to you...

44:26.264 --> 44:27.904
...if you'll let me walk.

44:28.024 --> 44:28.984
But...

44:31.184 --> 44:32.704
...you won't do that.

44:43.504 --> 44:45.304
Excuse me, but...

44:47.824 --> 44:49.304
...you are...

44:49.504 --> 44:50.664
...pathetic.

44:51.184 --> 44:53.104
You sound like a mark.

44:53.344 --> 44:55.024
What happened to you?

44:55.504 --> 44:57.904
Nothing. I know where you're going.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.304
I tell you...

45:00.784 --> 45:02.624
...that night in the taxi...

45:02.944 --> 45:05.384
...I thought I was lucky just to be alive.

45:05.464 --> 45:06.544
Now...

45:06.784 --> 45:08.624
...I think differently.

45:09.104 --> 45:10.864
You were the lucky one.

45:16.184 --> 45:18.544
I'm a very, very lucky man.

45:21.584 --> 45:23.104
No more chitchat.

45:27.984 --> 45:29.104
Good luck.

45:48.344 --> 45:50.744
Where are you? Talk to me.

46:01.304 --> 46:02.624
Can you hear me?

46:03.664 --> 46:04.944
Fuck.

46:12.824 --> 46:15.704
Everything is in order.
Please, come with me.

46:38.064 --> 46:40.704
This is awkward. It's not really my affair...

46:40.784 --> 46:44.224
...but I was told you would
give us something in return.

47:03.344 --> 47:05.744
Oh God, I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

47:28.104 --> 47:29.544
Now...

47:29.704 --> 47:31.304
...we are closed.

47:56.984 --> 47:58.824
Step outside.

48:00.064 --> 48:01.544
Step outside...

48:01.704 --> 48:03.384
...and I'll set you free.

48:03.544 --> 48:06.664
Excuse me, sir,
would you please sign this receipt?

48:10.424 --> 48:11.864
I got the sword...

48:12.064 --> 48:13.544
...right here.

48:14.264 --> 48:16.184
There is no shame.

48:17.224 --> 48:19.384
You won't feel a thing.

48:22.144 --> 48:23.984
Thank you for your business.

48:24.264 --> 48:25.544
You're welcome.

48:38.584 --> 48:39.704
Here he is.

48:40.184 --> 48:41.304
Here he is.

48:41.624 --> 48:42.824
Thank you.

48:48.184 --> 48:49.304
We've got it.

48:49.384 --> 48:50.824
We did it.

48:52.984 --> 48:54.184
Come on.

48:54.344 --> 48:55.744
Step outside.

48:55.864 --> 48:56.904
We're in.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.264
You there?

48:59.304 --> 49:00.504
Where are you?

49:06.904 --> 49:08.104
You there?

49:12.584 --> 49:13.784
Can you hear me?

49:13.864 --> 49:14.864
Look up.

49:15.304 --> 49:17.584
I want to see your eyes, motherfucker.

49:19.944 --> 49:20.904
Look up.

49:39.424 --> 49:40.064
Jasmine?

49:40.144 --> 49:41.064
Howdy.

50:36.584 --> 50:38.344
You have something of mine.

50:38.504 --> 50:39.784
I need it now.

50:49.624 --> 50:51.784
We got something for you here!

50:55.264 --> 50:57.304
What the fuck do I do with this?

50:57.464 --> 50:58.784
Two against one!

50:59.624 --> 51:01.704
Is that your edge, Rath?

51:03.784 --> 51:06.344
You didn't take the mark!
You took the bribe!

51:13.504 --> 51:14.504
Don't worry!

51:14.584 --> 51:16.424
Don't worry, I'll take her!

51:16.904 --> 51:18.984
He's serious, Rath!

51:19.144 --> 51:20.344
Even the odds!

51:21.664 --> 51:23.944
Are you scared, honey?

51:24.544 --> 51:26.584
I'm going to find you!

51:44.904 --> 51:48.424
I told you I was going to
tear your heart out!

51:50.384 --> 51:51.824
And I will!

51:53.504 --> 51:54.704
I will!

51:55.744 --> 51:57.664
I promise you that!

53:15.104 --> 53:16.304
Wait here.

53:31.664 --> 53:33.184
I said, stay up there!

53:33.344 --> 53:35.984
I'm not going to. The floor could give way!

53:36.144 --> 53:38.464
Goddamn it, why don't you listen to me?

53:40.384 --> 53:41.584
Don't move.

53:42.704 --> 53:43.904
Throw it away.

53:44.384 --> 53:45.824
Throw it away!

53:50.144 --> 53:52.224
That was no way to talk to a lady.

53:59.264 --> 54:00.224
Nicolai.

54:05.424 --> 54:07.184
It's been a long time.

54:13.344 --> 54:15.344
The years have been good to you.

54:16.544 --> 54:17.624
Miguelito?

54:18.464 --> 54:21.104
Never pictured him so young. A shame.

54:21.264 --> 54:22.864
Second best, after all.

54:23.144 --> 54:24.304
He killed you...

54:24.384 --> 54:25.664
...15 years ago.

54:25.824 --> 54:27.024
Yes, he did.

54:28.344 --> 54:29.344
I don't understand.

54:29.424 --> 54:32.944
Walking out of that bank was
the worst moment of my life.

54:34.224 --> 54:36.064
He always went for the heart.

54:37.664 --> 54:38.824
Predictable.

54:43.904 --> 54:45.264
15 years.

54:46.464 --> 54:48.384
For 15 goddamn years...

54:50.224 --> 54:52.384
...you let me think I'd killed you.

54:55.344 --> 54:56.944
Son-of-a-bitch.

54:58.384 --> 54:59.984
Son-of-a-bitch.

55:00.704 --> 55:04.144
You're forgetting you shot me.
You son-of-a-bitch.

55:04.304 --> 55:05.424
Why?

55:05.584 --> 55:07.104
Why did you set me up?

55:07.504 --> 55:09.104
The Cold War was ending.

55:09.264 --> 55:10.624
I needed to die...

55:11.184 --> 55:13.344
...to leave no past behind.

55:13.584 --> 55:15.184
You delivered me.

55:16.464 --> 55:17.784
You're the mark?

55:18.224 --> 55:19.984
You must be the contractor.

55:20.304 --> 55:22.704
I'm disappointed. You were to kill her.

55:29.984 --> 55:31.424
You're a thief.

55:32.704 --> 55:33.904
A good one.

55:36.464 --> 55:37.904
I retired.

55:38.384 --> 55:39.984
You were so good.

55:40.544 --> 55:43.424
I had to use both my
best to track you down.

55:44.144 --> 55:47.264
There's something on that disk
that would bring you to life?

55:47.344 --> 55:49.584
Enough information to expose us all.

55:50.144 --> 55:51.584
Especially me.

55:54.864 --> 55:56.624
Can't you kiss and make up?

55:58.384 --> 56:00.304
This is sad for me, Robert.

56:00.864 --> 56:01.984
Sentimental, but...

56:02.064 --> 56:04.224
...I did not want to find you alive.

56:06.744 --> 56:08.184
First things first.

56:25.184 --> 56:26.464
Don't do this.

56:30.464 --> 56:32.064
She's right.

56:32.864 --> 56:34.064
She always is.

56:34.704 --> 56:36.544
Female intuition.

56:40.584 --> 56:42.344
Where are you going?

56:43.144 --> 56:44.664
To finish something...

56:45.264 --> 56:47.464
...you didn't finish years ago.

56:48.104 --> 56:48.984
What?

56:53.784 --> 56:55.344
Just to make sure.

57:00.144 --> 57:01.144
Take it.

57:04.424 --> 57:06.104
Are you going to kill me?

57:06.184 --> 57:08.464
I never wanted to kill you at all.

57:14.224 --> 57:15.384
Help me up.

57:15.944 --> 57:16.944
Will you?

57:17.304 --> 57:19.024
Don't even breathe hard.

57:24.024 --> 57:25.584
You want to die?

57:29.544 --> 57:30.984
Help me up.

57:39.664 --> 57:40.744
Thank you.

57:46.704 --> 57:48.024
Now what?

57:49.544 --> 57:50.904
I'm finished.

57:51.664 --> 57:53.064
What do you mean?

57:53.704 --> 57:55.464
The history stops here.

57:55.704 --> 57:56.784
No more.

57:57.144 --> 57:58.584
I'm gone.

57:59.184 --> 58:00.144
I quit.

58:09.864 --> 58:12.104
That would make me number one.

58:13.064 --> 58:14.344
Number one.

58:17.584 --> 58:19.224
I can live with that...

58:19.464 --> 58:20.584
...can you?

58:23.784 --> 58:26.024
Absolutamente, compaòero.

58:26.184 --> 58:28.144
Then live with it, Miguel.

58:28.624 --> 58:29.784
Live with it.

58:33.904 --> 58:36.104
It was very nice meeting you...

58:36.624 --> 58:38.184
...Robert Rath.

58:38.344 --> 58:40.984
It was very dangerous meeting you,
Miguel Bain.

58:53.584 --> 58:54.824
You know...

58:55.624 --> 58:57.704
...as long as you're out there...

58:58.824 --> 59:00.664
...I'll never be number one.

59:03.384 --> 59:04.624
Say good-bye...

59:05.064 --> 59:06.064
...Bobby.

59:10.344 --> 59:11.544
No good-byes.

59:14.224 --> 59:15.584
Good-bye, Miguel.

59:42.544 --> 59:43.824
Thank you.

59:52.144 --> 59:53.424
Wait a minute.

01:00:03.984 --> 01:00:06.064
You'd better keep the disk, Robert.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.064
My real name is Joseph.

01:00:08.224 --> 01:00:11.104
I'm Anna. Nice to meet you, Joseph.

01:00:11.344 --> 01:00:13.944
So, Joseph, let's go get Pearl a boyfriend.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:18.064
Sure. And after that, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go to the hospital.
