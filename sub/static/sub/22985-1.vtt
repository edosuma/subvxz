How are you?

01:37.998 --> 01:40.734
We watch your show all the time.
Good to see you.

01:40.734 --> 01:45.139
Thank you. Thank you.
All right. You have a good day.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.541
( all screaming ):
Bye!

01:50.911 --> 01:54.248
MAN:
They say the only luck
is the luck you make.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.451
In the winter of '88,
I was the luckiest man alive.

01:57.451 --> 02:01.889
I had it all-- fame, fortune
and my own parking space...

02:01.889 --> 02:04.024
at Harrisburg's
trendiest bistro.

02:04.024 --> 02:07.261
I would have done anything
to keep it all.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.463
And, unfortunately,
I did.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.236
Jack, how are ya?
Good morning, Mr. Richards.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.204
Did you get a haircut?
Oh, yes.

02:17.204 --> 02:20.174
Yeah, it looks good.
Don't get too good-looking.
I'll be out of a job.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.710
( chuckles ): Oh, how about
this winter weather, eh?

02:22.710 --> 02:25.479
Farmer's Almanac
sure didn't get it
right this year.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.582
"Caterpillar in June,
cold winter soon."
That's what they said.

02:28.582 --> 02:32.887
Well, amateurs, jack.
Hillbilly folklore,
that's all it is.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.389
You should write
your own almanac,
Mr. Richards.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.958
Something people
could believe in.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.394
Maybe one day I will, Jack.
Maybe one day I will.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.930
Enjoy your breakfast.
Good morning.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.932
Wendy, how are you?
Just fine.

02:44.932 --> 02:49.103
Yeah. How's the cold?
Oh, it's just allergies,
I think.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.138
Really? Oh, not allergic
to me, are you?

02:51.138 --> 02:55.576
No. ( laughs )
I don't think so.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.479
You're so bad.
Guilty as charged.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.315
I'll be right back
with your cantaloupe
and egg whites.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.118
Okay. You pick me a ripe one.
Excuse me, Mr. Richards.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.786
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can I get a picture?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.321
Well, sure.
It's my son's birthday,

03:07.321 --> 03:08.923
and he saw you walk in.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.559
What's your name, Skipper?
Sam.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.928
Sam. Well, you're
a big fella, Samarino.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.930
How old are you today?
Twenty-seven?

03:15.930 --> 03:17.932
( chuckles ):
I'm five.

03:17.932 --> 03:21.001
Five? Well,
how's the wife?

03:21.001 --> 03:24.071
All right.
Happy birthday.

03:24.071 --> 03:27.274
Thanks for coming by. All right.
Thank you.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.610
Oh, you gotta love it.
Wow.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.780
You're Russ Richards,
aren't you?

03:32.780 --> 03:35.282
Last time I checked.
Well, hello!

03:35.282 --> 03:37.284
Hi. Here.

03:37.284 --> 03:41.655
Let me guess.
Mmm. It's a resume
of some sort,

03:41.655 --> 03:44.024
and you're looking for a job
in broadcasting.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.627
Yeah, just read it.
Asshole.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.665
You are Mr. Lucky today.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.802
I found you the ripest melon
in Harrisburg.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.639
CHIPMUNKS:
♪ Christmas don't be late ♪♪
Fuck!

03:58.639 --> 04:01.842
ANNOUNCER:
Live from Harrisburg
and News Center Six.

04:04.078 --> 04:07.147
Covering Harrisburg, York,
Lancaster and Lebanon,

04:07.147 --> 04:10.184
it's News at Five  with
Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer...

04:10.184 --> 04:13.153
and Russ Richards
with the weather.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.463
This is News at Five.

04:22.463 --> 04:26.867
MAN: Good evening.
A Perry County teacher
is behind bars tonight...

04:26.867 --> 04:31.271
for allegedly locking
an unruly student
in a broom closet.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.240
That story coming up.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.609
But first, let's check in
with the weather center...

04:35.609 --> 04:39.446
to see if these beautiful
spring-like temperatures
will continue.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.116
Russ?
Yes, it's the middle
of December,

04:42.116 --> 04:45.219
and we still have more
60-degree weather
heading our way.

04:45.219 --> 04:48.088
Now don't panic, folks.
You're not in the twilight zone.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.557
( humming theme
from Twilight Zone )

04:50.557 --> 04:53.594
Now, on the downside,
if the weather gets any nicer,

04:53.594 --> 04:56.230
my Aunt Mildred could move back
from Ft. Lauderdale.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.165
Just kidding.
A wonderful woman.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.468
Anyhoo, I'll be back
with a complete forecast
a little later.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.137
Take it, Dan.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.473
Thanks, Russ.
We'll check in with you later.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.743
MAN:
And now the fourth.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.980
WOMAN:
Eleven.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.582
MAN:
And the fifth number, please.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.584
Hi, Russ.
WOMAN: Thirty.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.386
Hey, Dottie.
How are you?

05:19.386 --> 05:21.388
Oh, still struggling
with the diet.
Oh, yeah?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.691
Don't get too thin.
It's not good for you.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.759
Eight.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.064
MAN:
And there you have it.

05:30.064 --> 05:34.568
Tonight's Pennsylvania
lottery number: 19, 47,

05:34.568 --> 05:38.972
3, 11, 30, 8.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.308
If you have it,
come and get it.

05:41.308 --> 05:44.878
If not,
better luck next time.
Back to you, Dan.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.115
We gonna talk about this?
There's nothing
to talk about, cochise.

05:48.115 --> 05:52.319
I told you no more loans.
Penn Fed's down the street.
This is not--

05:52.319 --> 05:54.922
This is not--

05:54.922 --> 05:58.992
This is not a loan, this is
an advance. Stop acting like
it's coming out of your pocket.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.962
If you didn't piss
your money away, you
wouldn't need an advance.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.966
Now what is it this week--
racquetball courts?
Peewee golf?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.469
Snowmobiles. You know it.
I told you that.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.271
Jesus Christ.
It's exhausting with you.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.308
Snowmobiles. How's business?

06:14.308 --> 06:17.111
When this heat wave ends,
I'm golden.

06:17.111 --> 06:20.147
Well, you're the weatherman.
End it.
( groans )

06:20.147 --> 06:21.782
Where the hell is he?
Crystal!

06:21.782 --> 06:24.752
How many times do I have to tell
those guys about the cables?

06:24.752 --> 06:28.288
I almost broke my fucking neck
on live television!

06:28.288 --> 06:30.090
Yeah.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.626
Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of a meeting.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.996
No, it's okay.
It's okay. Calm down.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.698
Calm down.
You know--

06:37.698 --> 06:40.534
Come with me.
I have to leave, of course.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.870
I talked to them
about this thing.
It's never gonna happen again.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.340
All right? Just relax.
It's not gonna happen again.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.376
Hi, boss.
Hello. How you doing, Bobby?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.378
I can't do
the Olive Garden tonight.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.547
( scoffs ): My wife invited
a few people over.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.984
I've gotta eat at home.
That's just great, Dick.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.986
No, you know what?
I am tired of this bullshit.

06:58.986 --> 07:02.456
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy. Come on.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.992
Remember, we got
that affiliates thing
coming up.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.994
Uh-huh.
Six days in Hawaii.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.097
Mm-hmm.
Eating like pigs.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.099
Christ, you got
some body on you.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.968
( giggles ): Tell me something
I don't know.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.742
Do we have anything else
to talk about? I think
we're through here.

07:21.742 --> 07:25.179
Unless you
want to torture me about
the fucking weather chopper.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.781
Like that was a bad idea.
Weather chopper?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.885
Come on, I'm a weatherman.
You know what the truth is?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.854
I feel bad for you, Dick.
I do.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.657
Because one day
you're gonna wake up,
and you're gonna realize...

07:36.657 --> 07:40.160
that you had a diamond
in the palm of your hand
and you let it slip away.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.462
To where, Atlantic city?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.432
Oh, that's what this is about.
To be a big game show host.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.868
That's right.
I hear everything.

07:47.868 --> 07:51.305
I'm like a satellite
in outer space.
Did you get your audition?

07:51.305 --> 07:55.642
My agent is all over it.
Right.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.648
RUSS:
Mace Kornberg, please.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.718
Yes, this is Russ Richards.
Mm-hmm.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.122
You know, this is getting
a little ridiculous.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.225
I've already left,
like, five messages.

08:11.225 --> 08:16.930
All right, your boss,
Mace Kornberg,
saw me on TV, okay?

08:16.930 --> 08:20.300
He loved me, okay?
He wants to represent me.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.170
We-- we sat at
my personal booth at Denny's...

08:23.170 --> 08:26.006
for over an hour,
and I told him
all about myself.

08:26.006 --> 08:30.444
And now for some reason,
he's not returning
my phone calls.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.948
Well, what part of that
was too long?

08:35.948 --> 08:41.554
Well, just-- just tell him that
Russ Richards called, okay?
Thank you.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.325
( sighs )

08:45.325 --> 08:48.161
What's happening?
Still not there?

08:48.161 --> 08:50.664
Nah, but, you know,
the whole agency
is out for the week.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.634
A retreat or something.
What's a retreat?

08:53.634 --> 08:57.704
Oh, I'm not sure,
but I think it's
a religious thing.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.073
Hey, I got some
great news for you.
Oh, yeah?

09:00.073 --> 09:04.111
Yeah, remember I told you
about my brother's car,
the one that was in a wreck?

09:04.111 --> 09:07.381
For the sake of expediency,
I am going to say yes.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.383
Well, he's finally ready
to sell it.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.686
It's all pounded out,
repainted, and ready to go.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.156
Beautiful lime-green finish.
Looks just like a popsicle.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.026
Now, Larry,
is there some reason
that I should know this?

09:19.026 --> 09:24.531
Well, just if you decide
the Jag is too much
of an extravagance, you know.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.566
I'm not selling the Jag.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.369
I'd sell my body parts
to South America
before I'd sell that Jag.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.238
Okay. You're the boss.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.408
Yeah, I am the boss.
And here's another
news flash for you.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.610
I'm not losing
the house either.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.479
You know what you laymen
fail to realize?

09:39.479 --> 09:43.083
It's not about
the snowmobiles. Come on.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.885
It's about the weather, okay?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.387
One cold front,
a little moist air, and bam!

09:47.387 --> 09:52.092
Yeah, I'm Rockefeller.
I'm on Broadway.
I'm doing the cha-cha-cha.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.127
Yeah!

09:54.127 --> 09:56.363
( moaning ):
Oh, God!

09:56.363 --> 10:01.501
Oh, whip me forever!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

10:01.501 --> 10:04.304
( both moaning )

10:07.240 --> 10:09.309
( Russ sighs )

10:14.681 --> 10:18.952
Boy, whew!
That is always
such a treat.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.723
Oh, with Dick, it's like
having sex with a sloth.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.993
Don't put that image
in my head.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.529
Here. Try this
just one time.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.298
No.
Yeah, it'll help you relax.

10:31.298 --> 10:36.103
No! I don't even
want a contact high.
It makes me nauseous.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.272
You shouldn't even
be smoking it.
You're the lotto girl.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.042
You practically work
for the state.
Put it out.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.910
Okay, I'm putting it out.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.913
I have a question to ask you.
Yeah?

10:46.913 --> 10:50.283
If you had an agent,
and you tried to get him
for two weeks,

10:50.283 --> 10:53.487
you tried eight times and
he didn't return your call,
what would you think?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.023
Um--
Huh?

10:56.023 --> 10:58.692
I can't relate.
I've never had a guy
not call me back.

10:58.692 --> 11:03.130
Oh!
I just don't get it.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.099
When I met-- I met this guy,
he was-- he was gushing.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.136
He wanted to do this for me,
he wanted to do that.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.305
I've had my ass kissed,
but this was really special.

11:12.305 --> 11:17.911
So, he is officially your agent,
right? It's not like
you just had that one meeting.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.980
It's splitting hairs
here, you know.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.082
I mean, it was clear
he wanted to sign me.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.284
You know what
he said to me?

11:24.284 --> 11:27.320
He said that I delivered
the weather forecast
with a Shakespearean flair.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.956
( chuckles ): Was he drunk?

11:29.956 --> 11:33.493
No, he wasn't drunk.
What's wrong with you?

11:33.493 --> 11:36.596
Look. If the guy's
not returning your calls,
then fire his ass.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.965
Just hire someone else.
What's the biggie?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.967
Do you know
who Mace Kornberg is?
Uh-uh.

11:40.967 --> 11:44.438
Do you have any idea of
the pedigree of this man?
No.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.406
Here's a little primer
for you.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.675
He only handled Gene Rayburn
at the height of the Match Game.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.610
That's all.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.779
Wow. All right,
so he is kind of a big shot.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.948
Yeah, congratulations.
You just won the Cutlass.

11:54.948 --> 12:00.187
I wouldn't be caught dead
driving a Cutlass, thank you.
I'll trade it in.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.256
Well, how about
door number two?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.258
Old reliable.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.294
( giggles ): Wait.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.280
You're in a very small,
select group of guys.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.282
What is it that makes you
successful...

12:29.282 --> 12:32.219
and all the others
knocking on the doors
not so successful?

12:32.219 --> 12:34.354
Well, I'm not so sure.
You know, as I travel
around the country,

12:34.354 --> 12:37.524
I see on television,
I see guys that would make
good game show hosts.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.593
But I don't tell them.

12:39.593 --> 12:45.065
No. I think, to me,
the analogy is a game show host
is the icing on the cake,

12:45.065 --> 12:47.267
but the format
is the cake.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.769
Yeah, format is the cake.
To me, Dick Clark,

12:49.769 --> 12:54.274
for all the things
he does, is an outstanding
game show host.

12:54.274 --> 12:58.378
He stays out of the way.
He lets the format work.

12:58.378 --> 13:03.817
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's your host, Russ Richards!

13:03.817 --> 13:07.687
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's your host, Russ Richards!

13:08.755 --> 13:11.458
( TV continues, indistinct )

13:11.458 --> 13:15.262
So, Russ, it sounds like
we can keep those scarves
and mittens...

13:15.262 --> 13:17.664
in mothballs
a while longer then.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.332
That's what it sounds
like, Dan.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.102
And the sleds and snowmobiles
can stay in the garage.

13:22.102 --> 13:26.206
That is correct, Heidi.
I think we all get the point.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.242
DAN: Thanks, Russ.
We'll check in with you later.

13:36.550 --> 13:40.387
( answering machine beeps )
Hello. You have one message.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.255
( beep )

13:43.924 --> 13:47.494
MAN:
Uh, yes. This message
is for Rob Richards.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.797
This is Sandy from
the Gabler-Kornberg agency.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.568
I'm sorry no one got back
to you sooner, but we were
away on a retreat.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.102
Apology accepted, Sandy.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.704
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know...

13:57.704 --> 13:59.639
that Mr. Kornberg is dead.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.841
He passed away
around eight months ago.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.644
Oh!
I'm sure had he not,
he would've returned your call.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.746
Oh, jeez!
For what it's worth,
he went quickly.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.848
Yeah. Yep.
Bye-bye.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.551
( beep )
That was your last message.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.821
( sighs ): Yep,
that was my last message.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.969
( rock music playing  )

14:33.506 --> 14:36.343
Russ, let me get
this straight.
You don't drink.

14:36.343 --> 14:40.680
You don't do coke.
You're not a pussy hound.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.516
Well, what the fuck
did you blow your money on?

14:43.516 --> 14:45.518
It just--
It just went, okay?

14:45.518 --> 14:48.888
Does it matter?
What was that?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
That's Carla,
the human cannon.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.060
Oh, she's good.
She's Dutch.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.631
Russ, we go way back.
Right.

14:57.631 --> 15:02.135
And I like you.
I do. I'm a fan.
But 25 grand.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.005
I just don't think
I can lay my hands on
that kind of money.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.073
Oh.
Especially now.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.910
I'm going through
a very messy divorce.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.912
I'm sure you understand.
Sure.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.181
I do now.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.852
Okay. Take care, Gig.
Thanks a lot. Take care.

15:18.852 --> 15:22.922
Hypothetically speaking though,
it's not like you're a man
without options.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.991
What do you mean?

15:24.991 --> 15:27.560
Well, you do have options.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.531
What are they?
Come. Speak up. Hello?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.833
Take your glasses off.

15:33.833 --> 15:37.737
( hums )
Well, what is that?

15:37.737 --> 15:41.841
Russ, I assume you have
insurance on your dealership.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.977
Yeah, so?

15:43.977 --> 15:46.880
Don't you think now would be
the appropriate time to,
you know,

15:46.880 --> 15:50.283
make a few claims on, you know,
some of those premiums?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.853
Oh, God. Oh, jeez!

15:53.853 --> 15:55.655
Are you talking
about arson?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.558
The last thing you
want to get involved
with, mate, is arson.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.894
Well, that's right.
Yes, of course not.

16:00.894 --> 16:04.364
No, the way to beat
an insurance company these days
is with a phony robbery.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.766
Oh, God.
( scoffs )

16:09.336 --> 16:14.040
You are veering in that
direction. That makes me
very uncomfortable, Gig.

16:14.040 --> 16:17.711
First of-- look.
If I weren't, okay,
the president of the Rotary,

16:17.711 --> 16:20.146
the vice president
of the Sunshiny Day Club...

16:20.146 --> 16:22.182
and I'm a Big Brother, Gig.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.951
Russ, it's your money.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.853
( sighs )

16:26.853 --> 16:31.925
The insurance company
is earning interest off it.

16:31.925 --> 16:35.929
I mean, the whole
"man of the people,"
nice guy thing,

16:35.929 --> 16:40.200
it's very quaint,
but don't you think it's time
to put a cap on it, hmm?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.470
( exhales )

16:43.470 --> 16:45.905
Well, how would it work?

16:45.905 --> 16:48.475
You know, like, you know,
hypothetically speaking.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.244
How would, you know,
how would it go down?

16:51.244 --> 16:54.581
Well, it's nothing.
No?

16:54.581 --> 16:57.684
If I were to put it
in medical terms...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.820
where you would
equate brain surgery
with a bank robbery,

17:00.820 --> 17:03.022
this would be like a visit
to the podiatrist.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.959
Hmm.
And it just so happens...

17:05.959 --> 17:08.795
I have an acquaintance
named Dale who is a specialist
in this sort of thing.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.598
It's a very simple
procedure, Russ.

17:12.598 --> 17:16.301
The whole thing would take...
40 minutes.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.905
Forty? Wow.

17:18.905 --> 17:22.075
Forty minutes, tops.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.744
Dale arrives at your dealership
on a prearranged night
with his crew.

17:25.744 --> 17:30.083
MAN:
♪ It's so easy to blow up
Your problems ♪♪

17:30.083 --> 17:33.420
( music continues  )
Finds his way inside.

17:33.420 --> 17:38.091
Leaves the telltale signs
of a break-in...

17:38.091 --> 17:40.093
and gains entrance.

17:40.093 --> 17:44.898
Then it's just a simple matter
of getting the sleds
out the back door.

17:44.898 --> 17:50.670
I mean, the actual extraction
process is the easiest bit.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.907
And, uh, that's that.

17:53.907 --> 17:59.279
All that's left is between
you and your insurance company.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.519
End of story.
Easy as pie.

18:06.519 --> 18:11.090
I, of course, would command
you know, the standard
20% consultation fee.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.227
I figured that.
You know, it's up to you, Russ.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.863
I mean, only you know
if you're ready for
something like this.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.834
That visit to the podiatrist.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.904
Well, it's like removing
a bunion or something.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.006
An ingrown toenail,
at the very most.

18:27.006 --> 18:31.344
Funny. Okay. Okay.
Well, make the call then.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.746
Good choice.

18:33.746 --> 18:37.784
♪ I was in the right place
But it must have been
The wrong time ♪

18:37.784 --> 18:43.223

18:43.223 --> 18:47.160
♪ I was on the right trip ♪
All right.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.028
Let's do this cocksucker.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.932
( music continues  )
All right.
Let's do it.

18:52.932 --> 18:58.104

To get hung up in my mind ♪

18:58.104 --> 19:01.708

19:01.708 --> 19:04.878
Yeah, I got the keys,
don't I?

19:04.878 --> 19:08.047
All right. This one's
for Charlie Hustle, okay?

19:08.047 --> 19:10.850
The pricks wanna keep him
out of Cooperstown?

19:10.850 --> 19:14.654

19:25.899 --> 19:28.568

Come on. Move it!

19:28.568 --> 19:32.672
Let me just ask you
one question, your honor.
Where's my bat?

19:32.672 --> 19:36.042
Don't worry about
your bat, asshole.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.711
( phone ringing )

19:41.481 --> 19:43.616
( ring )

19:43.616 --> 19:46.019
Yeah?
I'm gonna break
your fuckin' face, man.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.354
What?
You better have
a bag of money down here...

19:48.354 --> 19:51.257
the split fuckin' second
they set bail, or I'm going to
tell them who hired me.

19:51.257 --> 19:54.994
Who is this?
I also want an extra ten grand
for pain and suffering.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.664
Are we clear, weatherman?
No, we're not clear.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.699
We're the furthest thing
from clear.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.734
I don't even know
who you are.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.570
Look. A second ago
I was asleep.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.706
And two seconds ago,
I was in a blueberry field
with my mother,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.508
and we were getting
along really well.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.010
Save that bullshit
for your psychiatrist.
I want my ten grand.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.979
Stop it!
Stop saying that!

20:12.979 --> 20:15.014
I don't have ten grand
to give you.
Oh, no?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.417
You'd better sell something
or kill someone.
I don't care!

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
You just get me
my fucking money!

20:19.419 --> 20:21.287
What--
( dial tone )

20:23.089 --> 20:24.958
( sighs )

20:44.844 --> 20:48.948
Okay, Russ.
It's gonna be a better day.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.718
WOMAN: Russ Richards! Hi!
How are you?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.786
Merry Christmas.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.889
Okay. Mmm.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.596
Scoop-a-doop, Russ, love.
What are you doing here?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.398
Problem.
What?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.800
Dale the thug's getting
a bit pissy about his ten grand.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.535
Dale the thug?
Dale the thug?

21:09.535 --> 21:12.472
That's his nickname?
When did that happen?
Yeah.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.575
Oh, that's childhood issues.
Trust me, you don't wanna know.

21:15.575 --> 21:19.145
He was fine for a day or two,
but now he's had time to stew,
you see?

21:19.145 --> 21:22.281
Good morning.
What can I get you?

21:22.281 --> 21:25.618
Can I have coffee?
But with whole milk.
Okay.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.754
And do you have those
little apple pastries?
Wendy.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.590
The apple pastries
with the cinnamon swirls.
He's not staying.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.259
He's leaving, okay?
Okay.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.528
Okay. All right.
Thanks for asking.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.397
( giggling )

21:37.397 --> 21:39.999
I cannot be seen with you.
I am a public figure.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.102
Russ, you don't return my calls.
I'm doing you the favor.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.973
And if there's a Dale the thug
issue on the table,
time tends to be of the essence.

21:46.973 --> 21:51.978
Gig, I'm tapped out.
All the money I got for the Jag,
I barely covered his bail.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.447
I am not having this
conversation here with you.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.649
Th-there's an omelette named
after me, for God's sake!

21:56.649 --> 21:57.884
What's in it?
You leave that alone!

21:57.884 --> 21:59.252
You leave and just go!

21:59.252 --> 22:01.220
Really? Really.
I'll follow you. Yes!

22:03.423 --> 22:05.158
Hmm. Well, I'll--

22:05.158 --> 22:07.694
Um, Russ, I'll just
be outside then?

22:07.694 --> 22:11.998
Oh, God!
Right?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.733
Let's go.
On top of everything else,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.902
they've impounded
his baseball bat
as evidence.

22:15.902 --> 22:19.172
He bought it at an auction.
Pete Rose hit with it
or some shit like that.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.307
He shouldn't have used it then.
Christ, even a plumber knows...

22:21.307 --> 22:23.443
to take his ring off
before he snakes the drain.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.944
Well, you screwed up,
he got pinched.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.612
I-I did not screw up!

22:26.612 --> 22:29.115
I can't control
the sexual appetite
of my employee.

22:29.115 --> 22:32.385
I mean, either way,
you're gonna have to
pay for it.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.725
You know, why don't you
just do this? Take-- Just--
Just get it over with.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.094
Why don't you just
set up an appointment
at his convenience...

22:41.094 --> 22:44.464
to come break my legs
or kick me in the nuts,
or whatever he does?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.699
Well, you know what?
I very much doubt
it'll be the latter.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.369
That's practically
how he treats his friends.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.505
You know, Russ, I've been
thinking about your situation,

22:52.505 --> 22:54.440
and it occurs to me
that sometimes in life...

22:54.440 --> 22:58.845
the greatest opportunities
are sitting right under
your nose.

22:58.845 --> 23:02.749
The only thing under my nose
is this place mat with
the presidents up to Carter.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.084
Am I missing something?
The lottery.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.186
Oh, that is so stupid!

23:07.186 --> 23:10.957
You think that my playing
the lottery is going to solve
all my problems?

23:10.957 --> 23:14.627
Not playing the lottery,
winning the lottery.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.697
You got that lotto ball machine
down at the station, right?

23:17.697 --> 23:21.067
All I'm saying is
a little razzle-dazzle,
you're set for life.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.071
Gig, I just came off
a botched phony robbery.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.441
Let me bask in that for a while
before I start thinking
about tampering...

23:28.441 --> 23:31.110
with the fucking
state lottery!

23:31.110 --> 23:33.012
I'm not talking
out of my ass here.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.348
I do have experience
with this sort of thing.
Really.

23:35.348 --> 23:37.350
Yeah. About ten years ago,
Great.

23:37.350 --> 23:40.153
before I washed up
on these golden shores,

23:40.153 --> 23:42.421
I rigged a bingo game
in my local church hall.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.956
Church hall, huh?

23:43.956 --> 23:47.460
Weighed down
a few ping-pong balls,
Bob's your uncle!

23:47.460 --> 23:49.495
I walked away
with a fucking lawn mower.

23:49.495 --> 23:52.431
Oh, a lawn mower. Wow.
This is not War and Peace,

23:52.431 --> 23:55.034
merely the concept
of gravity.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.503
No, no,
the concept of gravity...

23:57.503 --> 24:00.540
is when you fall down
and you break your head open.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.042
Well, your glass
is obviously half empty.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.845
No, Gig, my glass
is totally empty.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.380
Watch it!
Hate you!

24:07.380 --> 24:09.315
Calm down!
Bastard!

24:09.315 --> 24:11.083
Calm down.
You're acting like a child.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.385
You're acting like a child.

24:12.385 --> 24:14.654
Stop! Calm down, please.
You promised!

24:14.654 --> 24:17.390
What do you want me to do?
What's going on?

24:17.390 --> 24:19.292
Everything's fine.
Thank you.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.928
She told me she wanted to go.
What do you want me to say?
"I'm sorry,

24:21.928 --> 24:24.230
I'm banging the lotto ball girl,
and I promised her first."

24:24.230 --> 24:27.834
I don't believe this
'cause I bought sandals
in December for no reason!

24:27.834 --> 24:31.537
Well, I'll take you
the next time. In June,
I have a conference in Seattle.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.739
Take your wife
to fucking Seattle,
all right?

24:33.739 --> 24:36.175
I wanted to go to Maui,
you asshole!

24:36.175 --> 24:38.845
Oh, I'm an asshole.
Am I the same asshole...

24:38.845 --> 24:41.247
that takes you out to dinner
and buys you fancy European
underwear?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.416
Try to get that
from the weatherman,

24:43.416 --> 24:45.852
who I notice you've been
awfully chatty with these days.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.788
Blow me.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.890
Is everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine!

24:50.890 --> 24:54.727

24:56.329 --> 24:58.731

25:30.563 --> 25:33.032
( music fades  )
I have to ask you something.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.569
What?
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.771
I don't know how
to ask you this.
( exhales )

25:38.771 --> 25:41.974
Just ask.
I wouldn't blame you
if you said no.

25:41.974 --> 25:45.344
As a matter of fact,
I already expect you to say no.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.781
But I need your help
on something.

25:48.781 --> 25:52.251
( screams ):
We're gonna be millionaires!
I can't believe this!

25:52.251 --> 25:55.755
I have to admit,
I thought it would be
a slightly harder sell.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.829
All right,
most important thing...

26:03.829 --> 26:07.133
is getting alone
with that machine...

26:07.133 --> 26:09.602
five minutes before
and five minutes after
the broadcast.

26:09.602 --> 26:12.305
That's key.
Absolutely. That's
as key as it gets.

26:12.305 --> 26:15.875
Five minutes before,
five minutes after.
Did you hear that, Crystal?

26:15.875 --> 26:18.277
I'm two inches away.
How could I not hear it?

26:18.277 --> 26:21.347
You better start
taking notes, 'cause when Gig
and I start hashing it out,

26:21.347 --> 26:24.984
there's gonna be lot of gold
flying around here, and I don't
want to miss any of it.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.954
Okay? N-Now the first
piece of gold is this.
Yeah.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.222
I think someone
should call in
a bomb scare.

26:30.222 --> 26:34.927
Then the building gets
evacuated, and I'm alone
with the lotto balls.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.129
Okay? Are you
writing this down?

26:37.129 --> 26:40.599
When we decide,
I will write it down.
It's good, right?

26:40.599 --> 26:44.303
Russ, um, forgive me.
Just a second.

26:44.303 --> 26:48.374
You call in a bomb scare,
they evacuate the building,
Mm-hmm.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.476
and shut down the broadcast.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.411
Right, and then
the firemen will come...

26:52.411 --> 26:56.782
and then the policemen
will come, so kind of
a lame idea, you know?

26:56.782 --> 27:00.586
All right. Jeez.
It's just an idea.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.655
It's a work in progress,
for God's sake.

27:02.655 --> 27:06.993
Even a painter's
got to take the brushes
and clean 'em.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.227
Whatever that means.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.930
You have any better ideas,
Miss Smarty-pants?

27:10.930 --> 27:15.301
Why can't I just
distract Bobby somehow,
the security guy?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.336
And then you
switch the balls.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.571
No, uh, lame.
That's lame. What?

27:18.571 --> 27:20.439
No, that's brilliant.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.640
Yeah?
No, really, it's so simple,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.075
it's brilliant.

27:23.075 --> 27:26.345
In its simplicity, Russ.
Simplicity. That's--

27:26.345 --> 27:28.347
And movin' on.
Okay, movin' on.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.616
Movin' on,
I guess.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.451
Okay, next most
important thing, right?

27:32.451 --> 27:33.819
Uh-huh.

27:35.554 --> 27:38.424
We need to find
your beard?

27:38.424 --> 27:40.326
What the hell's
a "beard"?

27:40.326 --> 27:43.329
You need someone
to buy the ticket
and claim the winnings.

27:43.329 --> 27:48.000
But it has to be someone
that you absolutely trust.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.371
One beard. Check.
Time out, folks!

27:52.371 --> 27:54.673
There's not a person
I would trust to do
this thing.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.876
Not a single person.

27:56.876 --> 28:01.380
Ah! Oh, God!
Oh, God. Okay. All right.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.849
I buy the ticket
in disguise.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.719
Okay?
And this eliminates
all the outsiders.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.888
That's the answer.
That's it. Okay?

28:08.888 --> 28:10.990
Yeah, yeah.
Now we're cooking
with gas, huh?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.727
I mean,
how would you
disguise yourself?

28:14.727 --> 28:16.962
What, as Charlie Chaplin?
As the tramp or something?

28:16.962 --> 28:19.732
( laughing ): Yeah, or no, like,
from the Wizard of Oz.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.068
The straw guy.
The Straw Man.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.503
Yeah, he could put
hay in his clothes
and wear a hat.

28:24.503 --> 28:27.006
With a pom-pom on it?
With a-- No one
will know it's him.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.974
Ooh, it's clever.
Nobody would ever know!

28:28.974 --> 28:33.212
No! Russ.
It's the Scarecrow
from the Wizard of Oz.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.981
Oh, okay.
It's Dorothy,
i-it's the Cowardly Lion,

28:35.981 --> 28:39.418
it's the Tin Man, it's the dog,
it's the flying monkeys...

28:39.418 --> 28:41.087
and it's
the Scarecrow.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.622
If you're gonna make fun of me,
get your facts straight.

28:43.622 --> 28:47.793
Well, my apologies, sir.
I am not the, uh, cartoon
aficionada that you are.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.795
It's not a cartoon, Crystal.
So what?

28:49.795 --> 28:51.797
It's a movie.
Who gives a shit?

28:51.797 --> 28:53.499
Children-- excuse me.
( arguing )

28:53.499 --> 28:55.835
It's a movie! For God's sake.
Calm down. Calm down.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.270
Calm-- Calm down.
Sorry.

28:58.270 --> 29:02.475
Please?
All right. Okay.
Back to square one.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.577
( chuckles ):
Let's go.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.350
Hey, I know.
My Cousin Walter
could do it.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.287
Who?
From Ohio.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.691
He would be the perfect beard.
He's this totally straight guy.

29:18.691 --> 29:21.494
He doesn't even drink,
and besides,
he has a crush on me.

29:21.494 --> 29:24.964

RUSS:
Oh, this is so great.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.370
Look at this TV, a closet.
God, look at the painting

30:04.370 --> 30:06.639
with the Three Mile Island
thing.

30:06.639 --> 30:10.476
Oh, and this clock
with a little light.
It's so-- It's so modern-day.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.212
CRYSTAL:
Oh, shower curtain.
Oh, Walter, look at this.

30:13.212 --> 30:16.315
All-you-can-eat buffet.
Oh. Right up the block!
Oh.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.450
( wheezing, coughing )
And towels.
They're all prepared for you.

30:18.450 --> 30:22.421
How comfy. What do you think?
Yeah, what do you think?

30:22.421 --> 30:25.491
( gasps ): Mold spores.
What?
Huh?

30:25.491 --> 30:29.061
This room has
a high content
of mold spores.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.564
My throat's closin' up.
Oh, jeez.

30:31.564 --> 30:32.765
( gasping, wheezing )
Oh.

30:32.765 --> 30:38.771
( wheezing continues )

30:38.771 --> 30:40.673
Are you-- Are you
all right, Walter?

30:40.673 --> 30:43.175
( wheezing )

30:43.175 --> 30:44.977
Mm. Tsk.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.012
( exhaling, gurgling )

30:47.012 --> 30:51.450
( wheezing )

30:51.450 --> 30:53.452
Oh, jeez.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.354
All clear.
All right! Hey, thank god

30:55.354 --> 30:56.655
for modern medicine.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.724
Yeah.
Hey, Walter, test the bed.

30:58.724 --> 31:01.660
It's a combination
of the heat and moisture.
That's what does it.

31:01.660 --> 31:07.032
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Is it always this sticky
in Harrisburg in the winter?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.468
Well, you know, it's--
it's a fluke, of course,

31:09.468 --> 31:11.704
but it's not
entirely uncommon, no.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.006
Uh-uh.
W-why's that?

31:14.006 --> 31:18.177
Well, okay, well,
historically weather has been
you know, unpredictable.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.513
Yeah, well, w-why's that?
Why?

31:21.513 --> 31:24.183
( sniffling )
Well-- well, okay, you got...

31:24.183 --> 31:26.385
your, uh--
you got your cold fronts
and you got...

31:26.385 --> 31:30.089
your warm fronts,
and then you're talkin',
uh, barometric pressure.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.826
Well, without my gauges, I-I--
I love hotels.

31:33.826 --> 31:36.228
Walter? Walter?
Hey! Walter.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.631
Yeah?
Are you clear on
what we're doin' here?

31:38.631 --> 31:41.834
How long will it be
be-before I get my money?

31:41.834 --> 31:43.769
Oh, well--
Oh. Yeah, no.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.671
Um, it's real simple,
honey.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.007
When we get our first payment,
you just take your 20,000

31:48.007 --> 31:49.742
right away.
Right.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.877
That's yours.
Right. Tax-free.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.613
( chuckling ): We want
you to be happy, Walter.
Oh.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.682
Well, I could-- I could really
use the money,

31:56.682 --> 31:59.518
'cause m-m-my church
needs a new furnace.
( chuckles )

31:59.518 --> 32:03.689
Oh, well, that
is so refreshing. Yeah.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.592
And I'm gonna use
the rest to open
an adult bookstore.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.061
Ah. Well, okay.
Well, that's good.
That's good too.

32:09.061 --> 32:12.731
Yeah.
Do you masturbate, Russ?

32:12.731 --> 32:17.736
( nervous chuckling ):
Jeez. I've been so busy lately,
I barely polish my shoes.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.738
'Cause I masturbate
all the time.
Oh, yeah?

32:19.738 --> 32:21.907
Yeah. Some people
think it's a sin,

32:21.907 --> 32:25.844
but I think god gave us
the ability to masturbate
to protect us from sin.

32:25.844 --> 32:29.381
Oh. Oh, okay.
Yeah. I could--
I could see that.

32:29.381 --> 32:33.185
Sure. Why not?
I like sex.

32:33.185 --> 32:35.654
There's a lot of sex
in the Bible.
Mm-hmm.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.257
I'm sure there's
a Bible here somewhere.
Yeah.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.392
Yeah, sure.
S-So, we--

32:40.392 --> 32:43.162
We're a team, right?
Yeah, yeah, a team!

32:43.162 --> 32:45.164
Yeah?
( chuckling ): Team.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.132
( chuckling )
Ooh.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.535
Yeah? Yeah?

32:52.838 --> 32:55.274
Oh, I've got one. Let me pick.
No, no, no, no, no!

32:55.274 --> 32:57.142
Please, let me finish. Okay, 16.
I wanna pick one.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.412
Sixteen, okay?
That's how old I was
when I first got laid.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.581
Really?
Yeah. Okay.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.250
Twenty-five.
Okay, twenty-five.
My mother's birthday.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.454
January 25, 1912. All right.
No, no. This--

33:08.454 --> 33:10.789
No, the 25th
was my anniversary,

33:10.789 --> 33:12.558
and I got divorced,
and I got screwed in that.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.960
I didn't get a good settlement.
Seventy.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.731
I had a '70 Camaro, and I got
in that bad car accident
and got a huge settlement.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.567
Oh, yeah. Famous whiplash. Okay.
Remember? That's right.

33:21.567 --> 33:25.204
Um, I got some randomly
selected numbers, okay?

33:25.204 --> 33:27.005
WALTER:
These are like
completely random.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.309
Okay?
Flick it like that.
Make sure air gets--

33:30.309 --> 33:33.879
Twenty-two,
seventy.

33:35.814 --> 33:40.586
Puncture. Then you
inject a little paint
into the ball.

33:40.586 --> 33:45.257
You know,
weigh 'em down.
Sixteen.

33:45.257 --> 33:48.093
Then we put
a little glue
over the hole.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.662
Nine.
RUSS:
Isn't this fun?

33:50.662 --> 33:53.966
Twenty-seven.
RUSS:
It's like summer camp.

33:53.966 --> 33:56.435
It's like
arts and crafts.

33:56.435 --> 33:59.905
Seven.
RUSS: The six
we don't inject.

33:59.905 --> 34:02.307
Those are gonna
rise to the top.
It's my birthday.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.978
Get it?
Okay. Those are
the winning numbers.

34:05.978 --> 34:08.447
RUSS:
This is the concept
of gravity.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.983
Sweet, simple concept
of gravity.

34:10.983 --> 34:13.118
Here we go. Go.
Ready?

34:13.118 --> 34:15.954
Yeah! Whoo!

34:15.954 --> 34:17.856
That's brilliant.
That is brilliant!
All right. Go.

I don't know why.
But I'm fine.
I just don't know--

36:00.792 --> 36:02.961
Make way. Give her space.
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

36:02.961 --> 36:05.998
Thank god. Yeah.
Crystal, you all right?

36:05.998 --> 36:09.134
But I don't know what happened
with the car.
Come on. Give her space.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.747
And I just had
the car checked.
Oh, that's crazy.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.982
Yeah.
Lucky you didn't hit your head.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.484
Well, who knows?
Maybe I did. I don't know.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.985
Maybe you should see a lawyer.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.721
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I know a lawyer.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.524
Do you? That's great, Bobby.
Thanks.

36:32.524 --> 36:36.261

38:33.145 --> 38:35.313

Oh! Thanks, Bobby. Good.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.582
No, let's-- Please, this way.
No, this way's better.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.384
No. This way!
All right.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.987
Oh, I'm not
making any sense.
Okay. Nice and easy.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.790
I-I-I don't-- Oh!
Nice-- I got you. I got you.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.671
You feelin' better now?
Ugh.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.973
I don't know.
Yeah.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.142
Uh-huh. Thanks.
I really do.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.763
( gasps ): Oh. Oh!

39:24.763 --> 39:27.499
Shit! Shit! Oh.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.901
God! Stop it!

39:29.901 --> 39:31.737

Come on!

39:31.737 --> 39:34.139

39:34.139 --> 39:37.409
Stay in, little mothers.
Oh, shit.

39:37.409 --> 39:40.278
Okay, okay, okay.

39:41.213 --> 39:44.249
Okay.
( sighs )

39:44.249 --> 39:46.084
Hey!
( screams ): Oh, Bobby,

39:46.084 --> 39:47.486
you scared me.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.255
Are you sure
you should be drivin'?

39:50.255 --> 39:52.090
Why don't you let me
give you a ride home?

39:52.090 --> 39:55.127
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine now.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.162
Yeah. I had
a Three Musketeers.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.598
Okay, then.
Get some sleep.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.567
All right. Thanks, sweetie.
Are you sure you don't
want me to drive you home?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.170
No!

40:05.170 --> 40:07.906
Thank you, though.
You're sweet.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.027
Good afternoon, Lawrence.

40:29.027 --> 40:31.163
Hey, Russ.

40:31.163 --> 40:33.265
I've been thinking about you.
Big news.

40:33.265 --> 40:36.434
No, I have.
First of all,
this is for you.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.137
Token of my appreciation for
how hard you've been working.
Thanks.

40:39.137 --> 40:43.441
And let me tell you
something else. A lot of people
have been talking about you.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.545
What people?
Let's get another thing
straight.

40:46.545 --> 40:50.916
No one is stealing you
away from me,
because you are--

40:50.916 --> 40:53.051
What are you?
Number one.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.887
That's right.
Wow, it's quite an honor.

40:55.887 --> 40:59.157
I don't know what to say.
Well, don't say anything.

40:59.157 --> 41:01.927
As our Jewish friends say,
"Enjoy."

41:01.927 --> 41:05.297
Look, Russ, remember
I told you about
my cousin's stepdad?

41:05.297 --> 41:08.033
The one with
the roadside fun park
in Colorado,

41:08.033 --> 41:10.135
in Leadville?

41:10.135 --> 41:13.038
Well, if you did, my brain
immediately purged it.

41:13.038 --> 41:17.075
Well, I gave him a call,
and I told him
about our situation,

41:17.075 --> 41:20.245
and he said he'd buy
our whole inventory
in one fell swoop.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.080
Really?
Well, how much?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.517
Okay, well,
here's where we run
into a small asterisk.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.751
Thirty thousand?

41:26.751 --> 41:29.521
( laughs ): Who is this guy,
Jesse James!

41:29.521 --> 41:32.691
I oughta get in
a Santa Claus outfit
and give 'em away.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.493
I just thought,
you know, if the noose
starts getting tighter.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.830
"The noose"?
Who am I talking to?

41:38.830 --> 41:42.467
Is this Larry, the winner?
Is this Larry number one?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.337
Am I talking to the Larry
that everybody's talking about?

41:45.337 --> 41:48.206
Who's talking about me?
Oh, hey.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.475
Hey, hey, good.
Good idea.

42:04.589 --> 42:07.392
Good morning, sweetie. Hi.
Hi.

42:07.392 --> 42:10.328
So, where is it?
What?

42:11.496 --> 42:14.266
The ticket.
I'm dying to see it.

42:14.266 --> 42:17.135
Well, I have it.
Don't worry.

42:17.135 --> 42:20.805
I'm not worried.
May I see it, please?

42:20.805 --> 42:23.441
Well, actually,

42:23.441 --> 42:25.610
I might hold on
to it for a while.

42:25.610 --> 42:28.780
What does that mean?
Well,

42:28.780 --> 42:31.650
first of all, how come
I'm only getting $20,000?

42:31.650 --> 42:34.486
I mean, I'm taking
all the risk, right?

42:34.486 --> 42:38.590
Walter?
And, you know,

42:38.590 --> 42:40.759
I'm-- I'm the one
who's gotta cash it in.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.028
What if they find out
this was rigged?

42:43.028 --> 42:45.897
No.
W-W-What if th-they--

42:45.897 --> 42:50.302
it's like this is
a setup or some kind of,
like, you know, an ambush.

42:50.302 --> 42:52.971
I could get caught.
I could get in trouble.
That's not gonna happen.

42:52.971 --> 42:55.740
No. Shh. Sweetie, listen.
You're being really silly.

42:55.740 --> 42:59.411
Okay?
Now, we made a deal,
and you agreed to it.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.479
So let's
just move forward
as planned, okay?

43:01.479 --> 43:04.115
No, why-- why can't we
split it three ways?

43:04.115 --> 43:06.685
The weatherman, you and me.
Who the fuck are you?

43:06.685 --> 43:11.122
I'm doin' all the work.
You're lucky to even get
a little bit, which is a lot.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.258
Well, can we-- I'm family.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.760
Go get
the fucking ticket!

43:15.760 --> 43:18.129
Now, give me the ticket,
you jerk-off!

43:18.129 --> 43:20.365
Get off me!
You're a whore!

43:20.365 --> 43:22.667
Stop it!
Oh!

43:22.667 --> 43:25.704
Do not fuck with me,
you sick, masturbating retard!

43:25.704 --> 43:28.139
Go ahead and rape me.
That's what you want!

43:28.139 --> 43:29.975
Shut up!
Where's the ticket?

43:29.975 --> 43:32.644
I'm not telling you, slut!
I want that ticket now!

43:32.644 --> 43:35.680
I'm telling your parents!
Stop it!

43:35.680 --> 43:38.483
Are you ready for the song
"Bingo Was His Name-o"?

CHILDREN: Yeah!

43:50.695 --> 43:52.664
My-- My-- My-- My--
My puffer.

43:52.664 --> 43:56.067
Your what? Stop it! What?
Puffer! Puffer!

43:56.067 --> 43:59.771
( wheezing, coughing ):

43:59.771 --> 44:04.042
I'll get it. God.
Get it. Thank you. Thank you.

44:04.042 --> 44:07.012

44:52.924 --> 44:55.693
Shit!
MAN: Okay.

44:55.693 --> 44:59.898
( screaming, yelling
on TV )

44:59.898 --> 45:02.167
Damn it!

45:08.073 --> 45:10.008
Come on. Where is it?

45:16.648 --> 45:18.950
Oh! Goddamn it!

45:27.859 --> 45:29.727
Ugh.

45:30.695 --> 45:33.298
( sighs ):
I'm gonna puke.

45:33.298 --> 45:35.233
Oh!

45:36.968 --> 45:40.705
Yes. Yes!
Yes, yes, yes! Yes!

45:40.705 --> 45:43.641
Hey, Walt,
met your girlfriend.

45:43.641 --> 45:45.777
Cute.

45:47.645 --> 45:51.416
( voice breaking ):
Yes, I need an ambulance
right away.

45:51.416 --> 45:56.054
My cousin... had some kind
of asthma attack.

45:56.054 --> 45:59.624
He's not moving.
Okay.

45:59.624 --> 46:02.660
I can't believe it.
I-I m in shock.

46:02.660 --> 46:04.529
I thought he had
one of those inhaler things.

46:04.529 --> 46:07.432
His puffer?
Yeah, I couldn't find it.
Yeah.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.833
You couldn't find it?

46:08.833 --> 46:10.802
No, well, we couldn't
find it at first.

46:10.802 --> 46:14.939
And then when we did
find it, it was all
out of shit, out of juice.

46:14.939 --> 46:18.309
Mist?
Yeah, mist. It was out of mist.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.912
Know what his last words were?
What?

46:20.912 --> 46:26.117
"Crystal,
my sweet angel,
Don't, don't.

46:26.117 --> 46:29.888
"Go into my wallet
and take the ticket,

46:29.888 --> 46:33.324
'cause you and Russ
deserve to have that money."

46:33.324 --> 46:36.060
Oh, God!

46:36.060 --> 46:38.129
Oh, fuck me.
No fried clams?

46:39.931 --> 46:41.933
Crystal? I know, baby.
Hmm.

46:41.933 --> 46:45.970
It's insensitive to--
Well, to bring up something
at a time like this,

46:45.970 --> 46:49.307
but I think we do have
a little problem.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.576
What?

46:51.576 --> 46:53.144
Well, with Walter gone,

46:53.144 --> 46:55.547
we have no one
to cash in the ticket.

46:55.547 --> 46:58.750
I mean, god rest his soul
and everything.
I wouldn't worry about that.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.519
Why?
I've got plenty of relatives.

47:01.519 --> 47:04.289
In fact, I'll probably
see a lot of them
at Walter s funeral.

47:04.289 --> 47:07.258
No. You know, I wouldn't
bring them into this.

47:07.258 --> 47:10.562
I mean, they've suffered enough.
WOMAN: There's Russ Richards!

47:10.562 --> 47:13.765
He's more handsome
in person!

47:15.833 --> 47:18.002
You know, it's times
like this you wonder.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.505
You wonder if there's
a higher being out there.

47:20.505 --> 47:24.209
I mean, maybe it was
just Walter s time on earth--
All right! Key lime pie.

47:24.209 --> 47:30.248
( rock music playing  )

47:45.396 --> 47:48.132
Hello, Jerry, mate. How are you?
Gig.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.105
Wanna hear a cute story?

47:54.105 --> 47:56.975
I would love to hear
a cute story.

47:58.443 --> 48:00.511
You know
I got a grandson,
six years old?

48:00.511 --> 48:03.047
That's a great age.
( chuckles ): Yeah.

48:03.047 --> 48:05.116
He says to me
the other day, he says,

48:05.116 --> 48:08.519
"Pop-pop, when I grow up,

48:08.519 --> 48:11.856
I wanna be a bookie
and run a numbers racket
just like you."

48:11.856 --> 48:13.958
Ohhh.

48:13.958 --> 48:15.860
I know. I melted.

48:16.995 --> 48:20.431
And then he asks me,
he says, "Pop-pop,

48:20.431 --> 48:22.800
"when people play
the numbers,

48:22.800 --> 48:26.237
what number
do they try to win?"

48:26.237 --> 48:28.239
So I explain to him.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.875
I say, "Sweetie,
every week we bookies,

48:30.875 --> 48:35.480
we get the number from someplace
our customers know
we can't control."

48:35.480 --> 48:39.517
And he says,
"Like Sesame Street?"
Lovely that, isn't it?

48:39.517 --> 48:42.020
( laughing ):
It's amazing what these kids
come up with, isn't it?

48:42.020 --> 48:44.789
It's amazing. And I say,
"No, no, no, no,
not Sesame Street.

48:44.789 --> 48:47.225
"We get the number
from the lottery drawing
on television,

48:47.225 --> 48:49.427
"the last three digits
of the real lotto,

48:49.427 --> 48:52.730
"because everyone knows
no one...

48:52.730 --> 48:54.999
"can rig
the state lottery,

48:54.999 --> 49:00.171
which means no one
can rig a bookie's number."

49:00.171 --> 49:02.540
That's right.
And he, he looks at me.

49:02.540 --> 49:06.744
You know, big long look
with these big brown eyes,
and he says,

49:06.744 --> 49:10.148
"And I bet no one
can win either!"
( chuckles )

49:10.148 --> 49:13.551
He's a genius.
Kid's a genius.

49:13.551 --> 49:15.553
After all, h-how often
do I have to pay out?

49:15.553 --> 49:17.922
Once, twice,
three times a year.
If.

49:17.922 --> 49:20.091
If. So, moving right along.

49:20.091 --> 49:24.996
Next day, guess what.
I had 12 people
hit the same number.

49:24.996 --> 49:28.533
No shit!
Yeah.

49:28.533 --> 49:31.903
Which even
a six-year-old kid knows...
( chuckles )

49:31.903 --> 49:33.938
Statistically
it's impossible.

49:33.938 --> 49:36.708
Out of the realm
of possibility.
Can't happen.

49:36.708 --> 49:42.780
I don't know what
to tell you, Jerry.
Here's the funny thing, though.

49:42.780 --> 49:45.350
When I looked at
the people who picked,

49:45.350 --> 49:47.352
a pattern
started to emerge.

49:47.352 --> 49:51.155
Really?
Yeah. Your ex-wife.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.158
( laughing )

49:55.760 --> 49:59.564
Your ex-wife.
Your ex-wife's mother.

49:59.564 --> 50:02.734
Her mother's sister.
Your dentist.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.702
Your cousin Vic.

50:04.702 --> 50:07.739
A few other stray
crinkly leaves
from the family tree.

50:07.739 --> 50:10.441
They all played variations
on the same number.

50:11.876 --> 50:14.679
You know, Jerry.
Hmm.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.781
If it wasn't for the fact
that we are dear friends--

50:16.781 --> 50:18.816
We are dear friends, right?
Dear friends.

50:18.816 --> 50:23.221
I would suspect that you
are accusing me of something.

50:24.956 --> 50:26.758
Of what?

50:26.758 --> 50:30.495
I mean, Jesus Christ himself
can't rig the state lottery.

50:32.897 --> 50:35.900
Thank you.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.769
Unless--

50:37.769 --> 50:41.906
Unless Jesus had a buddy
down at the TV station.

50:43.074 --> 50:46.144
Ahh.
Ahh.

50:46.144 --> 50:49.547
Nah. ( chuckles )
A real stumper, huh?

50:49.547 --> 50:53.084
Yeah, it's a fuckin'
head scratcher, Jerry.
A fuckin' head scratcher.

50:53.084 --> 50:55.386
Fuckin' head scratcher,
mate.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.322
You know, I got some pals
down at the D.A.'s office.

50:58.322 --> 51:00.591
Always looking for
a good head scratcher.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.164
Now, Jerry,
you never told me
you had a grandson.

51:06.964 --> 51:08.766
I don't.

51:10.268 --> 51:12.537
( laughing )

51:29.754 --> 51:32.390
Hello, Dale, love.
How are you?

51:32.390 --> 51:35.359
What you gonna do
tonight, Kippy?
Gonna watch Sportscenter.

51:35.359 --> 51:37.228
You're gonna watch
Sportscenter,

51:37.228 --> 51:40.932
and you're gonna see
if Winchell is still out
with the knee thing.

51:40.932 --> 51:43.034
JERRY:
And if he's still out
with the knee thing,

51:43.034 --> 51:45.303
we gotta change the spread
on Detroit, right?

51:45.303 --> 51:47.205
Right.
So what are you gonna do?

51:47.205 --> 51:49.974
I'm gonna watch Sportscenter.
Go home. Watch it. Good night.

51:49.974 --> 51:53.244
Good night.

What the hell is she up to?

53:40.117 --> 53:43.621
You're not smart enough
to pull a thing like this off.

53:46.691 --> 53:49.026
Balls are just
laying there.

54:05.309 --> 54:07.178
Hey.

54:07.178 --> 54:09.647
( chuckling ): How are you?
Hey!

54:09.647 --> 54:12.717
Hey, you're that, uh--
you're the, uh--

54:12.717 --> 54:14.819
Weatherman.
Oh, shit!

54:14.819 --> 54:17.588
Hey, I watch you
every night!
Yeah? Thank you.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.991
Let me give you a hand.
No, it's okay.

54:19.991 --> 54:22.360
I insist!
I can carry my own
groceries, please.

54:22.360 --> 54:26.063
Wow, man!
It must be great having
a job like yours, no?

54:26.063 --> 54:28.199
Well, it, uh,
it pays the bills.

54:28.199 --> 54:31.168
Nah, you guys just read
a bunch of crap
from cue cards, right?

54:31.168 --> 54:34.839
Cold in the east.
A storm on the right.
It looks like rain.

54:34.839 --> 54:37.475
Aah!
It's a little more
complicated than that.

54:37.475 --> 54:40.544
Let me ask you something.
I'm trying to plan my birthday
in a couple of months.

54:40.544 --> 54:42.847
Can you tell me if it's
going to be a nice day?
It's gonna be grand.

54:42.847 --> 54:45.082
Oh, right, hey,
nice meeting you.

54:45.082 --> 54:47.351
Always great to know a fan.
Your name was?

54:47.351 --> 54:49.487
Dale.
Dale.

54:49.487 --> 54:52.757
Yeah.
The thug?

54:52.757 --> 54:57.361
So, Russ, I just want
to apologize about
the last time we spoke.

54:57.361 --> 55:00.831
I wasn't really feeling good.
I was feeling
sort of vulnerable.

55:00.831 --> 55:04.035
I had fear issues come up,
being arrested and all.
That's okay.

55:04.035 --> 55:06.804
Oh, yeah.
Plus, I was drinking,

55:06.804 --> 55:09.807
which I'm really not
supposed to do, you know,
on the medication.

55:09.807 --> 55:11.609
Oh, I see.
Can I have some of these?

55:11.609 --> 55:14.812
Yeah, go ahead.
You know, it wasn't
a good moment.

55:14.812 --> 55:17.314
I just wanted to
make an amends.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.617
Hey, listen,
don't you worry.

55:19.617 --> 55:22.286
The truth is, I should
be apologizing to you.

55:22.286 --> 55:26.457
I was gonna call you
about the $10,000, but
the station got so busy.

55:26.457 --> 55:29.326
Don't worry about
the ten grand, Russell.

55:29.326 --> 55:32.997
It's water
under the bridge.
Really? Wow!

55:32.997 --> 55:35.132
I didn't know that.
All right then.

55:35.132 --> 55:36.734
Okay, let's celebrate.

55:36.734 --> 55:38.769
Yeah, I wanna move forward

55:38.769 --> 55:41.605
because the new number I have
in mind is more like half a mil.

55:41.605 --> 55:44.709
( spits )

55:44.709 --> 55:47.011
( clears throat )

55:47.011 --> 55:49.213
Come here, Russ.

55:49.213 --> 55:51.415
I rather not.
Russ, come sit down.

55:51.415 --> 55:55.252
No, no.
Come on. Sit the fuck down!

55:55.252 --> 55:57.788
Okay.

55:57.788 --> 56:01.492
Unfortunately, Russell,
we have a new wrinkle
in the situation.

56:01.492 --> 56:03.494
Oh, really?
What's the wrinkle?

56:03.494 --> 56:06.363
Basically I had to play piñata
with Jerry the bookie's skull.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.066
See, that ups
the invoice a little.
Is he okay?

56:09.066 --> 56:11.736
No, he's dead.
Oh! Oh, god.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.871
You know, okay.

56:13.871 --> 56:16.640
I'm really uncomfortable
with this kind
of conversation.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.442
You know, not to mention,

56:18.442 --> 56:21.746
I broke my 1986 World Series
commemorative bat.

56:21.746 --> 56:24.715
Oh, yeah?
It was a birthday gift
from my mother.

56:24.715 --> 56:28.419
She's gettin' a little old,
and she's not feeling good
these days.

56:28.419 --> 56:31.288
She hasn't left the house
in six weeks.
Okay, just give me--

56:31.288 --> 56:33.924
You killed Jerry the bookie
with a bat?

56:33.924 --> 56:36.961
It's not like a half a mil
is gonna hurt you,
You crushed his skull?

56:36.961 --> 56:39.530
With that lottery ticket
of yours.

56:42.900 --> 56:46.871
Get me the money, Russ.
Ohh!

56:46.871 --> 56:49.106
Great, Gig.
We gotta talk about this.

56:49.106 --> 56:52.543
I'll fuckin' ball-bat you,
you creep cocksucker.

56:52.543 --> 56:54.712
Okay, okay.

56:54.712 --> 56:56.647
Okay.
( coughing )

56:59.784 --> 57:01.752
Mint Listerine?
Yeah.

57:01.752 --> 57:05.356
When did they
come out with this?
I don't know.

57:05.356 --> 57:07.525
Is it good?
Yeah, it's good.

57:10.194 --> 57:13.097
( tires screeching )

57:17.735 --> 57:22.072
All right, look,
just give this dale guy
a little extra money.

57:22.072 --> 57:25.543
Big deal. It's better
than losing it all.
Better than being dead too.

57:25.543 --> 57:28.813
Crystal, he hits people
with commemorative bats!

57:28.813 --> 57:31.549
He's not gonna
hit you with a bat.
He's your friend.

57:31.549 --> 57:33.951
What?
Yeah. You wanna see
the leather jacket I got?

57:33.951 --> 57:37.988
He's not my friend.
I just met this guy.
How can he be my f--

57:37.988 --> 57:40.157
Look-- $900.
( sighs )

57:40.157 --> 57:43.727
Made in Italy.
I'm not screwing around
anymore, you know?

57:43.727 --> 57:46.363
If it wasn't on a boat,
I don't want it.
Stop it, Crystal.

57:46.363 --> 57:49.633
You have got to stop
buying things from Italy.
You are not a millionaire.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.869
We-- We are not
millionaires.

57:51.869 --> 57:55.539
The first thing we gotta do
is find a trustworthy,
non-asthmatic person...

57:55.539 --> 57:59.310
to cash in this ticket
A.S.A.P., or we're dead.

57:59.310 --> 58:01.178
Funny you should
mention that.

58:01.178 --> 58:04.215
I think I have another
candidate who'd be perfect.
Oh, yeah? Who?

58:04.215 --> 58:07.651
This guy that I was seeing
for a while when I was
waitressing at the racetrack.

58:07.651 --> 58:10.387
I think he still
works there too.
A real sweet guy.

58:10.387 --> 58:13.824
Bought me a really
expensive parrot, too,
from Brazil or something.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.693
My cat bit its head off.

58:15.693 --> 58:18.729
You hated that fucking bird,
didn't you, sweetie?

58:18.729 --> 58:20.631
The racetrack, eh.

58:20.631 --> 58:23.434
Well, actually,
he's an unofficial employee.

58:23.434 --> 58:27.037
He injects horses
with some kind of shit
that makes them run faster.

58:27.037 --> 58:31.942
Forget it.
Just cross him off the list.
Forget him. Who else?

58:31.942 --> 58:35.012
There is Scatter,
the guy who installed
my carpet.

58:35.012 --> 58:37.715
Went to high school with him.
The man's name is Scatter?

58:37.715 --> 58:40.184
Yeah, well,
he's a total coke freak,

58:40.184 --> 58:43.387
which could work in our favor
because he usually needs money.

58:43.387 --> 58:47.091
No, junkies
are problematic.
Let's keep thinkin'.

58:47.091 --> 58:49.360
Mm-hmm.

58:51.061 --> 58:53.697
Wanna have sex?
Oh, yeah.

59:11.415 --> 59:15.386
You know, I-- I was just
feeling good that day.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.023
Yeah. I, uh--

59:19.023 --> 59:22.459
I don't know what to say.
I'm at a loss, boy.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.762
I'm at a total loss.

59:24.762 --> 59:28.098
I mean, here you are,
supposedly injured,
all right?

59:28.098 --> 59:32.903
You're collecting your full
lieutenant's salary
and full disability.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.639
I didn't even
want to do this.
Matt had to talk me into it.

59:35.639 --> 59:37.641
You know how stupid
I felt?

59:37.641 --> 59:41.946
The lower back,
it's an enigma.

59:41.946 --> 59:44.148
Pat, I'm gonna be
straight with you.

59:44.148 --> 59:47.551
Obviously I have
alternatives to pursue here,
but I'm not gonna do it...

59:47.551 --> 59:50.821
because-- 'cause I don't
want this getting out.

59:50.821 --> 59:54.558
All right?
It makes everybody look bad.

59:54.558 --> 59:58.429
From now on,
you are back on full patrol.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.831
Here, get started
with this.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.002
A missing person's case?
Yeah, a bookie.

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:08.372
Jerry Green.
No one's seen him
for about a week.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.874
Huh. Jeez.

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:13.744
What happened to him?
I don't know, pat.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:17.448
That's what you're
supposed to find out.

01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:19.616
Right. All right.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.786
We talked earlier about
the fact there's a shortage
of wading pools in the area.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:26.156
Dick? Judy said
you wanted to see me.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.726
Oh, hey, sport. Have a seat.
Be right with you.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:31.395
( chuckling )
Is that Chuck Rhodes?

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.163
This guy kills me.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:34.498
I found Crystal too.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:37.334
Oh, hiya, kid.
Judy, close the door.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.603
Okay.
Thanks.

01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:43.140
What's going on?
( laughing )

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.009
( TV turns off )

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:50.214
So, Russ,
how's the finances?
What?

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:52.082
What?
The finances.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:54.151
W-- Great.
Good.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:58.956
Because you seemed to be
in a bind a few weeks ago.
Well, that was then.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:02.159
Terrific.
And how are you, honey?
We haven't talked in a while.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.562
Did you know may left me?
Jeez, I'm so sorry about that.

01:01:05.562 --> 01:01:07.965
Life's tough.
And how.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:11.035
But you seem
to be doing well.
I'm great.

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:14.471
Why wouldn't you be great,
with a friend like Russ here?

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:19.209
Yeah. Look at that, huh?
Oh, jeez.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.545
Oh, boy.

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:24.381
How 'bout that?

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.583
Don't say a word,
not one.

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:31.321
'cause if I hear one
bullshit comment like, "What
are you talking about?"...

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:33.590
I'm gonna call the cops.
What?

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.728
Wh-what do you mean?
It slipped out, Dick.
We're listening. Go ahead.

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.763
I chewed on it
for three days,

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:43.534
and I'm convinced
I have enough evidence to
fuck you both up big time.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:46.670
Bullshit.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.572
Stop it. Shut up. You shut up.
You shut up.

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:50.874
Shut up! No.
That's bullshit.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.943
Dick, you have the floor.
You have the floor.

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.712
Go ahead.
Short and sweet.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.581
I want half the money,

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:59.516
or I'll have you arrested,

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:02.753
and I might even do it
on air, live.

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:06.123
Imagine the ratings.
I'd like to see you
fucking try, asshole.

01:02:06.123 --> 01:02:08.592
You're gonna see me.
I'll kill you,
I swear to god!

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:11.829
I'm gonna kill you!
You treacherous little bitch!

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.697
You got one week
to get your shit together.

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:17.201
Hey, you listening to me?
I want the money.
( door slams )

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:20.671
Okay. Okay.
Okay, let's do a little math.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.841
You want 20 percent,
Dale wants half a million,
God bless him.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.009
Dick wants half
of everything.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:30.514
I don't have a calculator,
but it seems to me
I'm suddenly in debt again!

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:34.218
Dale's money
comes out of your share.
He's your friend.

01:02:34.218 --> 01:02:37.521
He's not my friend.
He's his friend.
I hardly know the man.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:39.656
Who cares?
It's all fuckin' moot now.

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:42.326
The only thing that's moot to me
is the Dick Simmons issue.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.927
CRYSTAL: Yeah.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.697
You get a toothache,
you pull the tooth.

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:48.866
What does that mean?

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:51.468
Let's kill the son of a bitch.
Oh, god!

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:53.270
CRYSTAL: Yes!
No!

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.440
Yes!
One quick call to dale,
and we're back on track.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.609
Absolutely!
Let's do it.

01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:00.811
What is wrong with you?

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:02.713
He threatened us.
Just remember that.

01:03:02.713 --> 01:03:06.183
It is extortion.
Does that mean
he's gotta be dead?

01:03:06.183 --> 01:03:08.619
We're not giving him
half our money.
What money?

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:11.555
That worthless scrap
of shit we have?
Yeah, okay.

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:15.726
Maybe it's time for your friend,
the drug-addicted
carpet installer.

01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:19.363
Oh, Scatter.
Scatter! Yeah!
Maybe he could help us.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:22.833
This is killing me.
I have slept five hours
this whole week.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:26.336
Oh, god, here we go.
I have dandruff
with flakes this big.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.172
I've gained two pounds!

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:31.508
Listen to my voice.
I'm losing my instrument.

01:03:31.508 --> 01:03:33.410
Shouting isn't helping.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:35.012
WOMAN: Gig?
Yeah?

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:37.281
There's a couple of cops
in the club asking for you.

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:39.550
I'll be right in.
Oh, great!

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:43.453
Now there's cops in the club.
I've always wanted to give
an inmate fame.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:46.557
They kill the celebrities first
and then they fuck 'em
in the butt.

01:03:46.557 --> 01:03:50.260
Will you just relax, please?
There are cops always
in this club.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.030
They're probably arranging
an engagement party.
Yeah, right.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.800
Just hold on a tick.
Yeah.

Yes, I am. Gig.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:17.788
Gig, do you know a guy
by the name of Jerry Green?

01:04:17.788 --> 01:04:20.557
He apparently is known
to come in here.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:24.027
Yeah, Jerry the bookie.
Comes in here all the time.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.030
Has he been in here lately,
because, I mean,

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.433
nobody's seen this guy
around for a while.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:32.002
Ah...

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:34.304

Where... do you find girls
like that?

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:04.968
I mean, who'd do
that kind of stuff.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.237
Well, you know,
it's remarkably easy.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.072
You'd be surprised.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:13.944
These two, I believe,
we imported from
upstate New York.

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:18.915
I was gonna say,
they seem like...
Albany girls.

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:25.355
Uh, so, anyway, we just
wanted to drop by...

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:29.059
and find out
if you've seen this guy.

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.894
Well, I'll
let you know.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:34.898
Although, with Jerry,
he could be shacked up
anywhere.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:36.967
He's a bookie,
for Christ s sake.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:43.907
It was nothing. Nothing.
The word "lotto"
never even came up.

01:05:43.907 --> 01:05:46.443
See, Mr. Crazy Man?
Thank god!

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.211
They were checking on Jerry.
A missing person's thing.

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:50.447
They asked about Jerry?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.483
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was just routine.
Not routine.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:56.286
It's called
a murder investigation.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.922
No, trust me.
Dale took care
of everything.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:01.625
They'll find a cure for cancer
before they find Jerry.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.162
MALE ANNOUNCER:
Live from Harrisburg
and News Center Six.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:08.899
( news show theme  )
Covering Harrisburg, New York,
Lancaster and Lebanon,

01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:12.369
it's  News at Five
with Dan Shuff, Heidi Zimmer...

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.371
and Russ Richards
with the weather.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:18.775
( music continues  )
This is News at Five.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:21.445
Our top story tonight:

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:26.717
the body of a local bookmaker
was found floating
in the Susquehanna River today.

01:06:26.717 --> 01:06:31.254
Police say it was
definitely foul play
and are following leads.

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:33.256
More on that story
in a moment.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:35.192
First, let's check in
with the weather center...

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:38.962
to see if we can expect more of
these springlike temperatures.

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:40.964
Russ?

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.833
Russ?

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:46.503
Oh, yeah?

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.639
How about these
springlike temperatures?
What?

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:53.877
The uncommonly warm weather--
will it continue?

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.383
Russ?
Russ?

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:04.054
Uh, um, wh-what
was that question?

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:06.323
Thanks, Russ.

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:11.161
Well, it seems like we can
keep those thermal socks
in the cedar closet...

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.163
for the time being then.

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:14.998
That's right, Dan.

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:17.801
Police are calling it...

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:22.439
the crudest attempt
to dispose of a body
in recent memory.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.708
Jerry Green
of Linglestown...

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.843
was apparently
bludgeoned to death...

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:30.514
and then dropped into the river
with a small brick
taped to one wrist.

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:35.352
Police say this was
insufficient weight
to keep the corpse submerged.

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:54.471
( sighs )

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:57.541
What time did they pull
this bookie out of the river?

01:07:57.541 --> 01:08:02.179
Scotty told me around 6:00.
Ted told me 8:00.

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:05.148
It's like a fucking
guessing game.

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:09.152
They pulled him at 6:00
and bagged him at 8:00.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:13.089
Was he nude?
Somebody said he had
a t-shirt on.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:17.027
Why don't you get off
your ass and check
the reports, man?

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:23.867
I'm goin' with nude.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:26.870
I'm so glad this thing
is finally over.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:30.439
What does that mean?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.143
We don't have to look
for this guy anymore.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:35.645
Gee, wouldn't it be great if we
found out who killed him?

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:39.049
I realize that entails
a little more work, but I'm
just thinkin' out loud.

01:08:39.049 --> 01:08:42.786
Has it ever occurred to you,
chambers, that he was drunk...

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.720
and he just slipped
off the bridge?

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.924
Hmm? A little thing
called an accident.

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:51.461
Why is everybody around here
so foul-play happy?

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.863
The man was bludgeoned
to death, Lakewood!

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.733
His skull was bashed in,
he had a plastic bag
over his head...

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:59.402
and duct tape
around his neck.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.572
Keep going.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:11.648
MAN ON TV:
You're in a very small,
select group of guys.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.716
What is it that
makes you successful...

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.353
and all the others
knocking on the doors
not so successful?

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:17.587
MAN 2:
I'm not so sure.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.589
As I travel around the country,

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:22.192
I see on television guys
who would make good
game show hosts,

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.995
but I don't tell 'em.
( laughter )

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:30.100
I think, to me,
the analogy is a game show host
is the icing on the cake.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.270
But the format is the cake.
No one--

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.573
( man talking on TV  )

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:39.542
I'll love you
till the day I die.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:45.081
Yes! And again.

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.751
MAN:
At 2:15 that afternoon,
Johnny Clay--

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.554
( TV continues, faint )

01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:40.604
He's expecting me.
Come in.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.476
I don't know why I did it.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:50.046
It all unraveled
and then one thing happened
after another.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:53.016
Jesus.
I'm still in shock, boss.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:55.218
I'm in so much trouble,
Larry.

01:10:55.218 --> 01:11:00.223
No man becomes wise
without stepping on
the soil of fools.

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:02.759
Right. Right!

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.095
But I never claimed
to be--

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:07.831
That's good.
Where did you get that?
Is that from the Bible?

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:11.835
Actually, it's from this play
I wrote in eighth grade
about Evel Knievel.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:14.871
Oh.
What are you gonna do?

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.940
Well, I have a plan,
I do.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.676
But I need money.
I need it fast.

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:23.513
So I was thinking about that guy
who wanted the snowmobiles,
the one in Colorado?

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:27.017
Yeah.
Well, you think
he's still interested?

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:30.020
Yeah, I think so,
but you'd have to find
some way to deliver 'em.

01:11:31.054 --> 01:11:35.125
Set it up.
Set... it... up.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.694
DICK:
A hundred thousand dollars?
That's right.

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:42.499
You wanna sell me a lotto
ticket worth $6.4 million
for $100,000?

01:11:42.499 --> 01:11:44.300
Correct.
I want out.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.437
However, this is
a one-time-only offer, Dick.
One-time-only.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.873
I want the money,
I want it tonight
at the station.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:53.843
If I hear any excuses,
any bullshit comments like,
"I can only get part of it"...

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:55.712
or "I need more time,"
The deal is off.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:58.281
Be reasonable.
It'll take me a couple of days--
Deal's off.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:01.918
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Good decision.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:12.929
RUSS:
Now, I believe that I have
solved all of our problems.

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:16.933
CRYSTAL: Really?
What century is this guy in?
Why don't you pass him?

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:21.938
Put a motor on it,
Jake!

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.974
A year and a half
behind this freak.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:28.645
One, I found a buyer
for the snowmobiles,
a guy in Colorado.

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:31.614
I'm renting a trailer,
and I'm gonna
deliver them myself.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:34.217
But why Colorado?
But, uh, uh!

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:37.353
Number two:
the lotto ticket.
I sold it to Dick.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:41.324
Hundred grand cash.
Now it's his problem.
I don't think so.

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:44.861
Number three,
which is probably
the most important of all,

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.797
I'm leaving tonight
for good.

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.733
Now, questions.

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:51.401
( tires screech )

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:55.171
You fucked up
the whole thing!
You screwed it all up!

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:57.574
Stop it!
You crazy fool!

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:59.909
God, and I could've got
a car and everything!

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.978
Hey, now listen.

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.013
If I didn't do this,
we would be in jail

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:06.015
or at the bottom of a river...

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.384
with bricks taped
around our wrists.
( groans )

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:11.755
And you know it.
Oh, my God.
You're so stupid.

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:13.823
Oh!
Oh, Crystal.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:16.693
We are under surveillance.
Oh, yeah?

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:19.729
Yes. Last night I stopped by
a convenience store.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:24.734
A cop pulled in behind me,
he got out, he followed me in...

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.804
and then he pretended
to get a cup of coffee!

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:29.806
Did he pretend
to get a doughnut?

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:31.775
Oh, you know--
You are nuts!

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:35.311
You need to see
a psychiatrist.
Oh, I'm nuts?

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:39.582
You can't handle this!
What about this little puppy?

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:44.154
There's enough mist
in this thing
to save ten masturbators.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:48.258
( rock music playing )

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:53.329
♪ Ain't no big thing
To wait-- ♪♪

01:13:53.329 --> 01:13:55.565
That's an ugly turn of events.
Mm-hmm.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:58.468
Mmm! What is this?
( music continues, faint )

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:01.004
Schnapps?
What, am I in third grade?

01:14:01.004 --> 01:14:02.372
Can I have a drink, please?

01:14:02.372 --> 01:14:04.507
Let's just talk
this through, shall we?

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:09.379
You're saying that Russ,
in his infinite wisdom,

01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:12.582
Yeah.
Sold the ticket
for a hundred grand.

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:16.286
Can you believe it?
A $6 million ticket!

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:20.690
I've got more brains
in my... shoe!
( grunts )

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:24.160
You know, Russ never really
had the stomach for this
sort of thing, did he?

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.164
Well, I do,
and I want that ticket back,
and I want Dick Simmons dead!

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:30.533
Do you hear me?

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:33.069
Fine. Fine.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.705
Speed dial.
I love it.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:39.108
And I want his head cut off
so I can hang it
from my rearview mirror!

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:41.110
That's just your anger talking.
Yeah.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.279
Dale. Dale, it's Gig.

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:45.014
His machine.
Oh.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:49.185
Um, see, things have got
a little bit sticky over here.

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:53.156
Slight change of plans,
nothing that your deft touch
couldn't rectify.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:56.960
So either swing by
or just return the call.
That'd be marvelous.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.896
Thank you.
Great.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.866
Slight snag though.
What?

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:08.304
Well, Dale-- bless him--
has been doing favor
after favor for us.

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.641
If it's not one thing,
it's... the other. So--

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:14.210
So what's your point?
( sighs )

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:19.315
If he's gets the ticket back
for us, we're gonna have to
give him a little more money.

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:22.752
No. No way. N-O.
That would only be fair.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.388
There is a limit
to my classiness.

01:15:26.456 --> 01:15:29.492
Quite obviously.
Shut up!

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:32.328
I'll handle this.
You just leave dale
out of it.

01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:35.598
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything
myself!

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:51.547
Hi.
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:54.350
An old face from the past.
What's on your mind, gorgeous?

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:57.287
Oh, nothin'.
Just wanted to say hello.
Really? That's sweet.

01:15:57.287 --> 01:16:00.490
'Cause the last time
we chatted, I believe you
threatened to kill me.

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.992
Gee, has something changed
since then?

01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:07.397
Well, you really did
outsmart us, didn't you?
Screwed us royally.

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:10.600
I'm impressed, Dick.
I'm like a lion that way.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.336
I hide in the weeds,
bide my time,

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:17.340
then I jump out
and tear the ass off
some dumb buffalo.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.676
Ooh. So, Mr. Lion,

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:22.512
how are you gonna
cash in that ticket?

01:16:22.512 --> 01:16:25.515
I'll think of something.
Don't lose any sleep over it.

01:16:25.515 --> 01:16:27.951
Believe me, honey,
I sleep like a baby,

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:30.353
'cause the second you try
to cash in that little fucker,

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:33.456
I'm going straight
to the Lottery Commission
and tell them everything.

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:37.627
If you did that, angel,
I'd rat you out quicker
than a frog can take a piss.

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:39.562
Mmm.

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.839
What do you want?
Halfsies.

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:51.708
Half.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:58.681
Have you been exercising?
'Cause you look great.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:06.522
Deal.

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:13.363
Nothing like rekindling
an old friendship.

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:46.763
Hey, that's him.
Wagstaff.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:49.932
Wagstaff?
Yes, Wagstaff.

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.734
Are you sure?

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:53.903
Yeah, light hair, 6'2",
lives at this address.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.105
You need anything else?
Does he have a record?

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:58.107
You should read
the report sometime.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:17:59.642
Wagstaff was overheard

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.444
bragging about the bookie's
murder in a bar.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:03.579
Oh, what a jerk.

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:05.982
You know what would
be unfortunate?

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:09.786
If we got into that whole
let's-follow-him rigmarole.

01:18:09.786 --> 01:18:13.589
( tires screeching )
Oh, perfect.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:26.069
( grunting )

01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:29.605
Oh, man!
It's getting cold out, huh?

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:33.109
I never realized
how heavy these things were.
Yeah, 4-40s, you know.

01:18:33.109 --> 01:18:35.711
K.C.-inducted engines,
twin carbs.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.613
Just touch that throttle
and boom!

01:18:37.613 --> 01:18:39.849
It's like gettin'
a chick off.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:43.519
Jeez, I hope that
wasn't your sales pitch.
Oh, yeah.

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:45.721
You actually
said that to people?

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:49.058
Well, you know,
just like biker types.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.927
Huh.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.198
Hey, Russ.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.935
Check it out.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.339
I don't believe it.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:07.643
I thought you called
for partly cloudy
and pleasant tonight.

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:09.712
A backdoor cold front.

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:12.215
A what?
A backdoor cold front.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.649
Rare.

01:19:13.649 --> 01:19:16.586
Almost impossible
to predict.

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:21.824
The atmosphere--
a beautiful yet fickle
beast she is.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:24.193
Is that from
the Evel Knievel play?

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.062
Yup.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.637
( sighs )

01:19:48.417 --> 01:19:50.987
( engine backfires )

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:54.957
( backfires )

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.141
CHAMBERS:
Where in the hell
is he going?

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.576
Beats me.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:17.246
He's definitely
up to something.
Definitely.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:20.750
We should call for backup.
You know, it never hurts.

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.985
You know, backup,
it's like an old friend.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:28.991
It's like an old, comfortable
sweatshirt you slip into
on a cold winter's night.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:33.229
Are you listening, chambers?
Get your head out
of the clouds!

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.810
Hey.
( moans )

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:50.613
Hey, wake up.

01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:52.815
Come on. Wake up.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:21:00.690
Fuck it.
( Crystal screams )

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.059
What?
Wake the fuck up!

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:05.061
What is this?
What do you want?

01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:06.896
You know what I want.
My wallet's in my pants.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.331
Take the $50 out of my wallet.

01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.866
And don't hurt me!
I'm just sleeping over.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.635
Where's the ticket?
What ticket?

01:21:12.635 --> 01:21:13.970
Gig sent you?

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.805
The fuckin' Tooth Fairy
sent me, Twiggy.

01:21:15.805 --> 01:21:17.740
Who do you think?
Hey, please leave.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.609
Don't fuckin'
play games with me.

01:21:19.609 --> 01:21:21.410
I'm hopped up on wine coolers
and antidepressants.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.079
I'm not feelin' good.
Where is it?

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:25.014
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:26.782
You don't know?
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:29.385
Do you like baseball?
What?

01:21:29.385 --> 01:21:31.420
Do you like baseball?
Yes.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.756
Who's your favorite player?
Ted Williams.

01:21:33.756 --> 01:21:37.093
Ted Williams. Oh, yeah.
He had some swing.
It was sort of like this.

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:38.928
( both screaming )

01:21:38.928 --> 01:21:41.731
No, hey, hey.
Hold on.

01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:44.300
Just take it easy.
I'm gonna call for backup.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.803
I'm gonna go around the back.
You cover the front.
No, you're in cowboy mode.

01:21:47.803 --> 01:21:50.806
Stop that!
Wait for backup.

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:53.809
Oh, shit. Shit.

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:57.079
Shit!

01:21:57.079 --> 01:22:00.383
Are we speaking
the same language now?
I'm gonna give him the ticket.

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.518
It's not worth it.
Life's too precious.

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:06.522
Good girl. You see,
that's all I ask for,
a little cooperation.

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:09.792
Here's your cooperation,
you mongoloid piece of shit!
Aaah! Ooh!

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:13.529
Oh!
Aah! Aah.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:20.636
( door slams )
Police! Freeze!

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:23.706
Don't shoot! No, no!
There's a raving crazy guy
up there!

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:26.409
Just go kill him.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.768
Aah! Ohh!

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:54.570
Lakewood, I'm hit!

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:58.607
Huh? Say what?
Don't let him through!

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.717
Aah!

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.357
CRYSTAL:
Somebody!

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:18.561
Get me a fucking robe!

01:23:36.245 --> 01:23:40.082
Isn't it ironic?
Yeah, ironic.

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:43.686
Just another word for saying
you're getting screwed.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:46.389
But so what, right?
It's all over now anyway.

01:23:46.389 --> 01:23:51.394
In a little while,
bim-bam-boom, I've got this town
in the rearview mirror.

01:23:51.394 --> 01:23:53.796
Hey, take me with you, boss.
What?

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:56.766
Yeah, a little
Colorado road trip.
No, no, Larry.

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:58.701
Come on. Let me go.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.570
I'm practically a fugitive.
I can't take you with me.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:05.007
Well, Russ, today, yeah,

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.643
I'm an authorized
Yamaha sales associate,

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:09.979
but tomorrow
I'm just another guy...

01:24:09.979 --> 01:24:13.616
boxing Peanut Butter Cups
at Hershey.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:16.051
Come on, Russ.
I have faith in you, man.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:19.155
Really? You would
just drop everything
to come with me?

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.257
Yeah, let the word
go forth--

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:25.294
the Russ Richards freight train
is about to leave the station.

01:24:25.294 --> 01:24:27.763
New horizons,
new conquests.

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:31.200
Ready to kick some new ass.
Bob Barker, watch out.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.335
Russ Richards
is headin' west.

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:35.871

( loud crashing )

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:21.944
I'm not gonna look.

01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:24.513
I think that's a good idea.
Yup.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:30.586
( chattering )

01:26:34.723 --> 01:26:37.159
Easy, easy.
I got it.

01:26:37.159 --> 01:26:39.995
Let's get him up.

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:42.197
Dick, where's the ticket?
( moans )

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:45.534
Answer me.
He can't answer you, ma'am.
He's been sedated.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.571
Why did you do that? Oh!

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.075
Fuck.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:26:59.281
Here.

01:26:59.281 --> 01:27:01.216
Oh.

01:27:06.989 --> 01:27:11.460
Thank you.
That was, uh, very brave
tonight, ma'am.

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.130
Yeah.
He was an animal
with an intent to kill.

01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:19.101
No shit, the fucking creep.
Oops. Excuse my French.

01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:25.641
Um, can I give you a lift...

01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:28.577
to the hospital?

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.946
Why? I'm fine.

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:33.782
No, I meant, to be
with Mr. Simmons.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.951
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:41.757
You know, it's kinda late,
and I have a lot of stuff
to do in the morning, early.

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:44.560
Stuff.
Mm-hmm.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.365
Well, we might need
some more information,
and, uh,

01:27:49.365 --> 01:27:51.100
uh, I might call you.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:54.837
I'm available.

01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:58.574
Fantastic.
Okay. Can I go now?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:01.143
Sure.
Thank you.

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:06.682
MAN:
Get him out of here.

01:28:09.184 --> 01:28:11.120
Hey, Chambers.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.355
All right,
hang on just a second.

01:28:13.355 --> 01:28:15.691
( loudly ): How you feeling,
partner?

01:28:15.691 --> 01:28:19.261
I'd feel a lot better
if I could get to the hospital.
Could you make this quick?

01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:22.464
We're all gonna pull you
through this, all right?

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:24.633
Positive attitude--
that's everything.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.670
Hey, pal,
he got shot in the leg.
I think he'll be fine.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:30.906
Let's hope so.
Be careful with him!

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:32.975
LARRY:
What are you doing?

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:37.379
I'm trying to
disconnect this trailer
so we can get out of here.

01:28:38.881 --> 01:28:40.883
( radio buzzes )

01:28:40.883 --> 01:28:43.052
FEMALE DISPATCHER:
Base to car six.

01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:46.455
( groans ):
What?

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:50.459
We've got a jackknifed
tractor-trailer at Route 22
in Devonshire.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:53.696
You're about a mile away.
( sighs )

01:28:53.696 --> 01:28:58.467
Great. Now I got
another 20,000 forms
to fill out.

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:05.207
( grunting ):
Why do they make these things
out of metal?

01:29:05.207 --> 01:29:07.609
Uh, I think it's twisted.

01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:09.411
No, it's coming.
It's coming!

01:29:09.411 --> 01:29:12.314
Oh, I don't know, Russ.
It's coming!

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:16.085
Shit! Fuck!

01:29:16.085 --> 01:29:18.253
Why-- Why the hell
is it snowing now?

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:21.590
Why the fuck
is it snowing now?
Fuck! Fuck!

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:23.992
( siren wailing )
Uh-oh.

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:27.362
Don't say a word without
your lawyer, even if they
beat the crap out of you.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:29.932
Not tonight. Nobody's beating
the crap out of me.

01:29:29.932 --> 01:29:32.901
You get out of here.
I don't want you
mixed up in this.

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:35.404
If I go to jail,
I'm goin' alone.
Wait!

01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:38.507
Your money's
in your briefcase!

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:45.314
No, Russ, don't do it!
Don't take that sled.
It's a piece of shit.

01:29:45.314 --> 01:29:48.717
Take the 4-40!
Excellent power-to-weight
ratio.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.019
What?
Two-year unlimited
service warranty!

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:54.990
A fix-it-yourself onboard
tool kit in the backseat!
Okay! Fine!

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:57.292
This beauty
is built for you!

01:29:57.292 --> 01:29:59.194
Hand warmers, halogen lights,
special all-track suspension!

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:00.996
Shut your trap. I got it!

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:02.865
Don't pull the choke.
The lines are dry.

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:05.768
No, don't flood it.
You said don't pull the choke.

01:30:05.768 --> 01:30:08.937
Finesse it, don't flood it.
It's like getting a chick off.
We went over this!

01:30:08.937 --> 01:30:12.141
( engine revving )
All right, you fellas.

01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:15.611
It looks like you're in need
of some assistance.

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:21.917

Huh?

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:25.154

Huh?

01:30:25.154 --> 01:30:28.423
I said back off,

Oh, you got pretty

That's beautiful.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.182
We figured you'd be up
in a minute.

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:02.484
You were singing
"My Way" In your sleep.

01:32:02.484 --> 01:32:06.488
You are so funny.
You're as funny in a coma
as you are on TV.

01:32:06.488 --> 01:32:09.758
I can't believe I'm alive.
One more.

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:12.694
You get it?
Okay, you have a visitor
outside.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.497
I'm gonna get your dinner,
and I'll be back in a minute,
okay?

01:32:15.497 --> 01:32:18.400
Okay. Bye.
Yeah?

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.371
Okay, bye-bye.
Bye.

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:26.275
Please don't upset him.
I'm not gonna do anything
to upset him.

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:28.877
You're in big trouble,
mister.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:31.446
No. Oh, god.
Yup.

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:33.715
You're gonna
have to pay for it.
I told them, officer.

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:38.520
I said it was a stupid idea
right from the start,
but nobody listened to me.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.857
That's good. Remorse.
Nice candy.

01:32:41.857 --> 01:32:46.295
'Cause, for starters,
we're looking at
three big ones.

01:32:46.295 --> 01:32:49.197
Oh, god! Three big--
Three years?

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:52.000
Three hundred dollars.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.169
What?

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.971
For the windshield.

01:32:55.971 --> 01:33:01.543
Plus, there's this
little baby right here.

01:33:01.543 --> 01:33:06.348
You'll have to put that
together with Scotch Tape,
but it still counts.

01:33:06.348 --> 01:33:08.984
This-- This is a ticket.
Yeah.

01:33:08.984 --> 01:33:13.755
For operating a class-two
vehicle without a license.
Weight class two.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:17.259
Officer, can't this wait?
Mr. Richards is suffering
from a mild concussion.

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:20.362
We're talking.
It's not even filled out.
There's nothin' on it.

01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:23.298
My pen ran out of ink.

01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:25.300
Officer,
I really must insist.

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:29.371
From doing paperwork
all night, between you
and saving your boss' ass.

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:32.174
My boss?
Dick Simmons.

01:33:32.174 --> 01:33:35.544
He's right down the hall here.
Wh-why is he here?

01:33:35.544 --> 01:33:37.846
Some thug broke
into his house.

01:33:37.846 --> 01:33:40.582
And broke both his legs
with a baseball bat.
Officer, please.

01:33:40.582 --> 01:33:43.685
Boom.
Was it--
Was it Dale the thug?

01:33:43.685 --> 01:33:46.555
Well, I don't know.
Some jerk with a plaid shirt.

01:33:46.555 --> 01:33:49.391
But don't worry.
( imitating gunfire )

01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:51.426
I killed him.

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:54.496

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.209
This is the lightning round.
I'm calling the shots now.

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:44.446
Quiet, I'm trying to ski.
Look, I got your money.

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:47.382
I'm gonna give it back,
but I need the ticket.
Where's the ticket?

01:34:47.382 --> 01:34:49.184
It's my show--

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:53.055
Okay, this is the plan.
I'm docking you
for being an asshole.

01:34:53.055 --> 01:34:56.058
And I'm docking Gig
for having people killed.

01:34:56.058 --> 01:34:59.227
And I'm docking Crystal
for being a twisted,
psycho bitch!

01:34:59.227 --> 01:35:02.230
Starting today, I decide
where the money goes.

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:06.468
If anyone doesn't like it,
we're all going to jail.
( blubbering )

01:35:06.468 --> 01:35:08.503
( gasps )
Give me that ticket.

01:35:08.503 --> 01:35:11.706
Where is it?
Where is the ticket?

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:14.743

Wendy, what are you
gonna do with the money?

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.132
I'm going to
put some of it in savings
and some of it in checking.

01:36:10.132 --> 01:36:13.935

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:41.763
Oh, I get

01:36:41.763 --> 01:36:46.334
