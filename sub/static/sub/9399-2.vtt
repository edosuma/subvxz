25:02.200 --> 25:03.861
Okay, you ready?

25:03.935 --> 25:05.027
Yeah.

25:05.303 --> 25:08.067
<i>When you're feeling moot</i>

25:09.140 --> 25:11.734
I guess everybody's here that's coming.

25:11.810 --> 25:13.072
Hi.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.172
Luke, I knew we weren't meant to be.

25:18.250 --> 25:23.620
<i>You can't say I do nothing, yeah</i>

25:25.657 --> 25:26.954
I should get home.

25:28.493 --> 25:29.653
See you.

25:30.295 --> 25:36.291
<i>Where you gonna go if they come for you?</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:39.697
Hey.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.897
I thought you'd be asleep by now.

25:44.009 --> 25:46.068
- How was your night?
- Good.

25:47.178 --> 25:50.579
I met Peyton. Let me ask you something.

25:50.649 --> 25:54.517
Do all of your ex-girlfriends
have to be so damn pretty?

25:54.586 --> 25:56.417
Well, like all my current girlfriends.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.252
(CHUCKLES) Oh. "All" better mean "one."

26:02.394 --> 26:03.884
Do you know if they're back for a while?

26:04.362 --> 26:05.795
Brooke and Peyton.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.425
I don't know.

26:08.633 --> 26:12.399
Brooke wants to help Peyton start her
own record label, maybe in Tree Hill.

26:13.271 --> 26:14.636
You think she'll be good at it?

26:15.307 --> 26:16.774
Yeah, she'd be great at it.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.936
Then if she needs help
you should help her.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.682
And I'll try my best
not to be insanely jealous.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.259
Hey, as soon as Brooke and Peyton get
here, we're gonna take off, okay?

26:37.329 --> 26:38.660
I'm not going.

26:39.464 --> 26:42.228
What? James is counting on you.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.427
I don't want anybody seeing me like this.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.830
Has it occurred to you that this
isn't about you?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.072
Haley! We're here!

26:55.213 --> 26:56.475
Okay.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.476
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.279
So I have a surprise.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.616
You're gonna like it. I made Jamie
a little something for his race.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.450
Oh, okay.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.682
Look, Mama.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.389
Oh, my goodness! Look at this.
This is a real racing suit.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.587
Mmm-hmm.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.596
And I even made you a sponsor,
P. Sawyer.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.791
Oh, yeah?

27:16.134 --> 27:17.692
PEYTON: "Peyton Sawyer, unemployed."

27:17.769 --> 27:18.758

27:19.971 --> 27:21.029

27:23.608 --> 27:25.041
Oh, baby, listen.

27:26.378 --> 27:29.472
Daddy's just not feeling very well today.
I'm sorry.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.014
He's not coming?

27:32.751 --> 27:34.685
No. I'm sorry.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.881
But everybody else is gonna be there.

27:37.522 --> 27:39.786
Oh, yeah.
I hear your Uncle Lucas is coming.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.758
And Skills and Mouth and all the guys.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.521
I'm pretty sure he's gonna have
the biggest crowd there.

27:43.595 --> 27:44.960
Absolutely.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.394
Yeah. Okay?

27:47.766 --> 27:48.926
Okay, come on.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.433
- Come on.
- Let's do it, dude.

- There is he, Lightning Jamie Scott.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.822
Hey, cool outfit, man.

28:15.894 --> 28:18.124
So, what's good, man?
You ready to win this thing, or what?

28:20.865 --> 28:25.063
Okay, I'm gonna need you to go ahead
and stop yelling and listen to me.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.694
No, you are yelling.

28:26.771 --> 28:28.363
You are yelling, and it's my company.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.237
Why are you yelling at me? I...

28:31.176 --> 28:34.407
There is a boy here. Yes, a boy. And he's...

28:57.268 --> 28:59.964

Okay. Thanks.

I don't wanna race, Mama.

30:08.439 --> 30:09.929
Well, you don't have to, but are you sure?

30:10.008 --> 30:11.908
I mean, I think it's gonna be really fun.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.705
I wanna talk to Brooke.

30:17.415 --> 30:18.507
What's up, handsome?

30:18.583 --> 30:19.777
I don't wanna do it.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.443
But I like my racing suit.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.647
The suit's yours, but are you sure
you don't wanna race?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.291
It's my life. I'm taking a stand.
Is that okay?

30:27.358 --> 30:29.622
Yes, that's okay, honey. Come here.

30:30.929 --> 30:32.362

You might know something about that.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.746
We're all afraid.

31:01.326 --> 31:05.057
Yeah, but he's four, and he needed
his dad, and his dad wasn't there.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.095
Nice work, Dan.

31:13.438 --> 31:16.498
Are you gonna say anything
or are you just gonna sit there

31:16.574 --> 31:18.405

Haley, do you understand that?
Do you understand what that means?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.743
I used to be Nathan Scott and I was great.

31:30.488 --> 31:32.683
And I should've walked away, okay?
I know that.

31:32.757 --> 31:35.021
And I didn't do it. And now I'm nothing.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.691
And I have nothing!

31:39.464 --> 31:40.692
(SIGHS)

31:41.666 --> 31:43.133
You have nothing?

31:44.569 --> 31:47.663
You have a beautiful son who is here.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.230
I am here.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.344
You have got to figure out
who you're gonna be in this, Nathan,

31:54.412 --> 31:57.939
because this version of you
does not work for us.

31:59.717 --> 32:03.050
I cannot keep living like this, okay?

32:04.956 --> 32:06.446
Do you understand what I'm saying?

32:07.125 --> 32:12.893
One more night like this, Nathan,
and I promise you, you will have nothing.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.373
A little early, don't you think?

32:28.646 --> 32:31.171
I usually don't start my hard drinking
till at least noon.

32:32.216 --> 32:33.581
Come here.

32:33.851 --> 32:35.250
I wanna show you something.

32:47.165 --> 32:50.328
So I talked to my mom

32:53.071 --> 32:54.595
and we decided we want you to have it.

32:55.306 --> 33:00.107
Rent-free under one condition, that it
becomes office space for your new label.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.475
- Luke...
- And I've already talked to Brooke

33:03.548 --> 33:05.539
so I don't think you have
any more excuses.

33:08.886 --> 33:12.117
You know that four years ago
I would've jumped at this.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.589
But what?

33:16.794 --> 33:18.887
It doesn't seem so cut-and-dry anymore?

33:19.764 --> 33:20.958
'Cause it's not.

33:21.933 --> 33:24.993
I wrote a novel
and I can't write a second one.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.667
Mouth's boss apparently hates him.

33:27.739 --> 33:31.732
Nathan missed his dream by a breath.

33:35.646 --> 33:36.943
It's life.

33:38.449 --> 33:41.043
So you couldn't change the world
from Los Angeles.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.650
Change it here.

33:47.425 --> 33:51.384
I know you can do it, and so do you.

33:54.399 --> 33:55.889
Just think about it.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.861
I was there, Luke.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.065
At your book signing in LA.

34:03.174 --> 34:05.142
LINDSEY: I know this is your first book
as an author,

34:05.209 --> 34:09.009
but it was also my first book to edit,
and I had the best year doing it.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.846
So I just wanted to say thank you,
and I'm proud of you.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.715
Okay, you ready?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.049
Yeah.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.391
I was there, Lucas.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.290
I was so proud of you.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.558
But we hadn't talked in a long time and I...

34:29.100 --> 34:32.728
I saw you with Lindsey and I figured you
guys were together, which clearly you are.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.864
And I like her. I do.

34:40.344 --> 34:44.576
But do you remember
when you first joined the Ravens

34:44.649 --> 34:47.812
and you took all my sketches
over to <i>thud</i> without asking

34:48.518 --> 34:50.748
and do you remember
what you said that night

34:50.822 --> 34:53.222
that you entered the gym
for the first time?

34:54.992 --> 34:59.395
"Your art matters. It's what got me here."

34:59.464 --> 35:03.366
Yeah, it's like you touched my soul.

35:05.002 --> 35:08.938
And a few days ago,
I was ready to quit again.

35:10.575 --> 35:14.443
But you saved me with the words
you wrote about me in your novel.

35:15.813 --> 35:18.611
So if you're struggling
to write the next one,

35:20.017 --> 35:24.784
you should know
that your art matters, Lucas.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.223
It's what got me here.

35:34.599 --> 35:35.827
Good morning.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.794
Sit down, Mr. Fields.

35:46.177 --> 35:47.906
I think we need a little break.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.909

35:51.549 --> 35:52.948
Oh, yeah.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.808

that door fails this quarter.

I'm just gonna fail you.

activities, say goodbye to sports.

your life is being shaped right now?

that door and fail this class

36:24.782 --> 36:26.079
and take your chances.

36:26.884 --> 36:30.752
Or you can sit down, listen and learn
from somebody that's been there.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.276
I wanna run it from here.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.941
I know it wasn't the plan.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.507
It's my life. I'm taking a stand.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.180
Bye.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.892
It's perfect, I'll take it. Thank you.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.690
<i>You can't buy a new life off the shelf</i>

39:58.763 --> 39:59.752
Thumbs.

40:00.664 --> 40:03.497
Help me with this. Come here.

40:06.337 --> 40:10.068
<i>It won't set you free</i>

40:12.209 --> 40:15.372
<i>HALEY: The rest of your life is being</i>
<i>shaped right now</i>

40:16.547 --> 40:18.811
<i>with the dreams you chase,</i>

40:20.117 --> 40:22.312
<i>the choices you make.</i>

40:23.154 --> 40:24.746
Jamie, wake up.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.416
Hey, we're going out, okay? Get ready.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.755
Where?

40:30.828 --> 40:33.991
It's a surprise.
And, hey, buddy, bring your cape.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.329
<i>HALEY: And the person you decide to be.</i>

40:40.905 --> 40:44.898
<i>Oh, how I wish I knew you back</i>
<i>when you were good</i>

40:49.580 --> 40:51.104
LINDSEY: You remember
why I gave you that?

40:51.549 --> 40:53.414
We went to dinner after the signing.

40:53.484 --> 40:54.849
That was our first date.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.480
You coming to bed?

41:01.725 --> 41:06.219
Actually, I think
I'm gonna write for a while.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.229
That's great, Luke.

41:10.301 --> 41:14.101
<i>You had it all right in the palm of your hand</i>
<i>and let it fall</i>

41:14.371 --> 41:18.808
You know, Son, there's gonna be a lot
of times in your life when you're afraid.

41:19.043 --> 41:23.275
Being afraid is okay, but if you don't
work through that fear

41:23.347 --> 41:25.508
you might miss out
on some pretty great things.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.811
Are you afraid, Daddy?

41:29.720 --> 41:32.655
Sometimes. You?

41:32.923 --> 41:34.515
Sometimes.

41:34.692 --> 41:36.353
Well, we'll do this together.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.827
On the count of three. One...

41:39.930 --> 41:42.091
- Two, three.
...two, three.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.930
<i>HALEY: The rest of your life is a long time.</i>

41:45.569 --> 41:49.733
<i>And the rest of your life starts right now.</i>
