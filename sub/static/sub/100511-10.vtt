Previously on When <i>Calls the Heart...</i>

00:02.150 --> 00:04.452
He sent the first three chapters
of my novel to his mother.

00:04.477 --> 00:06.453
She's willing to send
them to a publisher.

00:06.478 --> 00:08.296
<i>Mounties are looking for someone.</i>

00:08.760 --> 00:10.492
<i>Elias O'Rourke, you're under arrest.</i>

00:10.517 --> 00:13.406
<i>You were sawing a tree and
the tree fell on you.</i>

00:13.431 --> 00:15.678
That's my sister. Her name is Susannah.

00:15.703 --> 00:18.069
We haven't talked in years now.

00:18.094 --> 00:19.617
Do you have any idea where she is?

00:19.642 --> 00:20.642
Hello?

00:20.667 --> 00:21.853
<i>Susannah, please don't hang up.</i>

00:21.878 --> 00:22.953
<i>I have to come see you.</i>

00:22.978 --> 00:25.062
Emily ran off for something.
I have to go back for her.

00:25.087 --> 00:26.696
If I hadn't have gotten to
her she might have died.

00:26.721 --> 00:27.757
You both could have died!

00:27.782 --> 00:30.265
About the other night,
I owe you an apology.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.507
I just want you to be safe
because you matter to me.

00:43.908 --> 00:46.545
Now, I want you to take it easy today.

00:46.570 --> 00:47.735
I will, sweetheart.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.292
No need to push yourself.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.116
The only thing I'll be
pushing is pencils, alright?

00:52.141 --> 00:53.149
I promise.

00:53.174 --> 00:55.157
You don't have to take me
to the office, you know.

00:55.182 --> 00:57.672
I'm just spending time with my husband.

00:58.321 --> 00:59.555
Lee!

01:00.064 --> 01:01.477
You got a telegram this morning.

01:01.502 --> 01:03.422
- Now if this is work related,
- Thanks, Ned.

01:03.447 --> 01:04.781
I want Jesse to handle it.

01:05.569 --> 01:07.477
Well, what is it?

01:08.208 --> 01:09.829
It's from my sister.

01:10.128 --> 01:11.805
What did she say?

01:12.068 --> 01:13.677
She's coming to Hope Valley.

01:13.702 --> 01:15.294
- When?
- Tomorrow.

01:15.319 --> 01:16.474
- Tomorrow?!
- Yeah.

01:16.512 --> 01:20.831
Wha... I... that's wonderful.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.700
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:22.725 --> 01:24.552
Yeah, yeah. It's-it's wonderful.

01:27.623 --> 01:29.474
This outfit looks so cute on him.

01:29.499 --> 01:30.932
Doesn't it?

01:31.021 --> 01:33.130
Thank you so much for
coming early today, Laura.

01:33.155 --> 01:34.521
I'd just be doing chores.

01:34.546 --> 01:35.643
This is more fun.

01:38.294 --> 01:39.735
Would you mind taking him?

01:39.760 --> 01:40.833
Of course not.

01:40.858 --> 01:41.974
Come on.

01:41.999 --> 01:43.038
Oooh!

01:43.063 --> 01:44.099
Thank you.

01:44.434 --> 01:46.130
Look, do you want to wear this one?

01:46.155 --> 01:47.638
<i>This blue one looks good on.</i>

01:47.840 --> 01:49.941
- Lucas.
- Sorry to bother you so early.

01:49.966 --> 01:51.123
It's no bother.

01:51.972 --> 01:53.685
I just received word that Frank Branson

01:53.710 --> 01:55.232
wants to speak to you.

01:55.521 --> 01:56.967
Frank Branson.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.287
Of Branson Books?

01:58.312 --> 02:00.287
The publisher to whom my
mother sent your work?

02:00.312 --> 02:01.478
Oh, my goodness.

02:01.503 --> 02:02.990
Do you think he liked it? Or...

02:03.146 --> 02:05.341
Or is this a rejection?

02:05.472 --> 02:07.271
When a publisher wants to speak with you

02:07.323 --> 02:09.348
it usually only means one thing.

02:09.434 --> 02:11.467
And he's waiting for your call.

02:13.373 --> 02:14.521
Shall we?

02:41.043 --> 02:47.145

02:49.212 --> 02:50.547
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:51.157 --> 02:52.632
Hi, Ned.

02:54.818 --> 02:57.011
Oh, Fiona.

02:57.339 --> 02:59.430
Then it's true what I heard?

02:59.723 --> 03:02.189
My boss decided my job here is done.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.810
Oh...

03:05.814 --> 03:07.813
Well, you literally changed this town.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.196
If it wasn't me it would
have been someone else.

03:10.221 --> 03:11.614
Did you want me to place a call?

03:11.639 --> 03:12.985
Please.

03:13.146 --> 03:14.528
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:17.506 --> 03:19.867
OK, here we go.

03:23.891 --> 03:27.035
Relax, close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.055
Hello?

03:41.344 --> 03:43.683
Yes, this is Mrs. Elizabeth Thornton.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.894
Thank you.

03:49.481 --> 03:51.732
Great. Yes.

03:53.007 --> 03:54.985
Excuse me, how much?

04:04.560 --> 04:05.870
Are you getting a headache

04:05.895 --> 04:06.983
from all this concentration?

04:07.008 --> 04:09.449
No, I'm not getting-would you
please go to the dress shop?

04:09.490 --> 04:12.903
- What? Why?
- I have to get some work done.

04:15.646 --> 04:16.812
- Fine.
- Thank you.

04:16.837 --> 04:18.259
I will go.

04:19.312 --> 04:22.911
You know, I wish your sister had
given us more time to prepare.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.544
Yeah, me too.

04:24.801 --> 04:26.604
I don't understand why
you're not more excited

04:26.629 --> 04:28.352
about her coming.

04:29.598 --> 04:31.573
I am looking forward to seeing her.

04:31.859 --> 04:33.124
But?

04:33.149 --> 04:35.684
Well, it's this telegram business.

04:35.903 --> 04:37.862
- I offered to go see her.
- Mmmhmm.

04:37.887 --> 04:40.782
She sends a telegram to
avoid any discussion.

04:40.862 --> 04:41.862
Maybe...

04:41.887 --> 04:44.660
No maybe, that's my sister.

04:46.144 --> 04:48.511
Things were left pretty
cold between the two of us.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.395
Sending a telegram would
leave me to believe

04:50.420 --> 04:52.210
that not much has changed.

04:53.462 --> 04:56.539
Well, Lee, she's coming.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.580
Yeah.

04:57.605 --> 04:58.770
And that's something.

05:01.331 --> 05:02.761
Yeah.

05:07.267 --> 05:08.351
I still have to go?

05:08.376 --> 05:09.601
Yes, you do.

05:21.546 --> 05:23.281
Something wrong with
your breakfast, Henry?

05:23.306 --> 05:24.950
Oh, no, no. It's fine.

05:24.975 --> 05:26.744
I'm just not that hungry this morning.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.475
- Oh.
- Thank you.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.945
Mmmhmm.

05:34.390 --> 05:35.827
Oh, oh!

05:37.279 --> 05:38.924
Sit, sit.

05:40.478 --> 05:41.845
Are you alright, Henry?

05:41.870 --> 05:45.554
I'm OK, I'm just... just a little dizzy.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.893
Two hundred dollars?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.517
And that's just for the advance.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.476
Once it's published, who knows?

05:54.528 --> 05:55.987
I'm getting paid to write.

05:56.012 --> 05:57.281
I can't believe it.

05:57.306 --> 06:00.028
I can, because I've read your work.

06:00.306 --> 06:02.340
Well, I have you to thank for that.

06:02.365 --> 06:05.784
Oh, did I write those chapters?

06:05.986 --> 06:07.853
You encouraged me,

06:08.039 --> 06:10.579
and for that I will forever be grateful.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.361
This is so exciting.

06:13.908 --> 06:15.334
What's exciting?

06:18.046 --> 06:20.798
Elizabeth has just gotten a book deal.

06:20.949 --> 06:22.925
From a publisher in New York.

06:22.971 --> 06:24.470
That's amazing.

06:24.575 --> 06:25.742
Congratulations.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.218
Thank you.

06:31.515 --> 06:32.788
I should get going to school.

06:32.813 --> 06:34.461
I wouldn't want to be late.

06:35.227 --> 06:37.398
I'll see you at school in a bit.

06:37.423 --> 06:38.656
Sounds good.

06:38.681 --> 06:39.914
Make a grand entrance.

06:39.939 --> 06:41.718
Practise for when you're famous.

06:41.743 --> 06:43.843
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

06:53.132 --> 06:54.835
<i>Your blood pressure is even higher</i>

06:54.860 --> 06:57.093
<i>than it was last time you were in here.</i>

06:57.118 --> 06:58.550
Have you been getting headaches?

06:58.575 --> 07:00.437
No, I'm tired.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.906
I think you're suffering
from exhaustion.

07:03.162 --> 07:06.030
Isn't that just a two-dollar
word for "tired"?

07:06.105 --> 07:07.148
No.

07:07.173 --> 07:08.828
It's more serious than that.

07:08.941 --> 07:11.992
Alright, well I'll make sure
that I get some sleep tonight,

07:12.017 --> 07:13.283
but right now I gotta go.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.679
Thanks, Doc.

07:15.084 --> 07:17.083
Whatever you're going through, Henry,

07:17.205 --> 07:18.992
your health is more important.

07:21.144 --> 07:22.562
Thanks, Doc.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.544
Come on.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.084
So?

07:38.384 --> 07:40.184
Wow, you did all this?

07:40.209 --> 07:41.356
Mmmhmm.

07:41.381 --> 07:44.685
And this is my report on Queen Victoria.

07:47.178 --> 07:48.794
What do you think?

07:49.458 --> 07:51.157
I think that Mrs. Thornton

07:51.182 --> 07:53.255
isn't the only talented writer in town.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.489
I couldn't agree more.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.452
Allie's got quite the gift.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.544
I think it comes from reading so much.

07:59.820 --> 08:04.067
Mrs. Thornton, is it true
that you sold a book?

08:05.804 --> 08:07.255
It is.

08:07.327 --> 08:10.495
Does that mean you're not
gonna be my teacher anymore?

08:10.634 --> 08:12.919
No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere.

08:13.085 --> 08:14.417
I promise.

08:14.516 --> 08:15.778
Great.

08:16.145 --> 08:17.716
I have to go get something.

08:17.769 --> 08:19.356
Stay here.

08:19.385 --> 08:20.584
OK.

08:23.311 --> 08:24.929
Elizabeth, I was
wondering if you want...

08:24.954 --> 08:28.161
This is the aquatic food chain.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.341
Wow.

08:32.573 --> 08:34.073
<i>The whole chain.</i>

08:47.579 --> 08:49.002
Come in.

08:50.384 --> 08:51.916
Wow!

08:52.103 --> 08:54.205
This place is spotless.

08:54.230 --> 08:57.822
Well, Lee's sister is coming.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.299
Oh, that's fantastic.

08:59.324 --> 09:00.346
She changed her mind.

09:00.371 --> 09:03.068
Yes, but you know, there are
some Coulter dynamics going on

09:03.093 --> 09:05.961
between the two of them that I
won't pretend to understand.

09:05.986 --> 09:07.152
Oh.

09:09.656 --> 09:12.494
Alright, so tell me.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.557
Tell you what?

09:13.582 --> 09:14.604
Oh, Elizabeth.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.441
I can read you like a book.

09:16.466 --> 09:20.221
You are bursting at the seams
with some news, so spill it!

09:20.246 --> 09:21.572
Speaking of books,

09:21.597 --> 09:23.762
you know that publisher
who read my work?

09:23.787 --> 09:24.924
Yes.

09:24.949 --> 09:29.830
Well, he is paying me an
advance to publish my novel.

09:29.855 --> 09:31.674
- Really?
- Mmmhmm.

09:31.699 --> 09:33.768
Oh, Elizabeth!

09:33.793 --> 09:36.561
Oh, that is wonderful!

09:37.032 --> 09:39.130
So I suppose Lucas is forgiven?

09:39.155 --> 09:41.783
It seems I can't stay angry
with him for too long.

09:42.255 --> 09:44.122
You two do have an awful lot in common.

09:44.147 --> 09:45.760
Rosemary, don't start.

09:45.785 --> 09:46.941
Although you and Nathan seem

09:46.966 --> 09:49.676
to have patched things up, as well. Hmm?

09:51.176 --> 09:53.317
What am I gonna do?

09:53.707 --> 09:55.808
What are you going to do?

09:55.924 --> 09:57.911
I don't know.

09:58.211 --> 10:04.294
Well, sooner or later you're
going to have to decide.

10:05.003 --> 10:06.716
I know.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.051
I think by not deciding,

10:10.711 --> 10:13.551
in a way I'm protecting
myself from letting in

10:13.576 --> 10:14.708
either of them.

10:14.733 --> 10:16.208
Elizabeth.

10:16.673 --> 10:18.794
We all have our own path.

10:19.824 --> 10:22.630
When the time is right
for you to choose,

10:24.252 --> 10:25.452
you'll know.

10:34.232 --> 10:35.466
<i>Hey, Constable.</i>

10:35.494 --> 10:36.760
What?

10:36.821 --> 10:40.528
It says here that the, uh,
Seattle Metropolitans,

10:40.853 --> 10:43.520
the first ever American team
to win the Stanley Cup.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.075
Yes, I heard that.

10:50.681 --> 10:51.925
<i>Bill?</i>

10:54.938 --> 10:56.567
Is everything OK?

10:57.005 --> 10:58.338
Well, I was looking forward

10:58.363 --> 11:00.130
to staying put for a couple of weeks

11:00.155 --> 11:03.169
but this gentleman's changed my plans.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.559
You got a minute?

11:16.707 --> 11:18.165
His family got him a lawyer

11:18.197 --> 11:20.138
so the trial's been moved to Buxton.

11:20.773 --> 11:22.017
Buxton?

11:22.042 --> 11:23.274
Why Buxton?

11:23.299 --> 11:25.466
Some of his crimes took place there.

11:25.491 --> 11:27.121
He has an alibi witness in the area

11:27.146 --> 11:29.273
so there's a valid reason for the move.

11:30.797 --> 11:33.110
OK. Fine, I'll make the arrangements.

11:33.178 --> 11:35.363
No, no. You gotta be there, too.

11:35.513 --> 11:38.282
The arresting officer has to testify.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.785
Uh...

11:42.134 --> 11:43.398
Excuse me, Miss.

11:43.423 --> 11:44.889
Certainly.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.501
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:51.526 --> 11:52.693
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:52.718 --> 11:54.309
How is Henry doing?

11:54.334 --> 11:55.466
What's wrong with Henry?

11:55.491 --> 11:58.343
Well, he nearly collapsed
in here yesterday.

11:58.527 --> 12:01.596
I can't really divulge his diagnosis.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.349
Sorry.

12:05.366 --> 12:08.615
But it probably wouldn't hurt
for you to encourage him

12:08.640 --> 12:10.188
to take it easy.

12:12.339 --> 12:14.373
She's coming to see you

12:14.398 --> 12:17.038
so she must want to make
amends as much as you do.

12:17.063 --> 12:19.699
Otherwise why would she travel
all the way from Bellingham?

12:20.066 --> 12:22.617
You're right. You're absolutely right.

12:23.129 --> 12:24.619
Of course I am.

12:30.823 --> 12:32.288
Here it is.

12:44.117 --> 12:45.516
Suse.

12:46.629 --> 12:47.976
It's Susannah.

12:48.862 --> 12:50.839
- Oh.
- Right. Of course.

12:50.864 --> 12:53.431
Uh, Susannah, this is my wife, Rosie.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.776
You can call me Rosemary.

13:04.461 --> 13:06.343
Hi. Is this a bad time?

13:06.413 --> 13:08.788
No, no, no. Not at all.

13:09.965 --> 13:11.435
I just came to check on you.

13:11.460 --> 13:14.027
I heard you had a bit of a
scare at the cafe yesterday.

13:14.052 --> 13:16.797
You know people in this town,
they have a vivid imagination.

13:16.822 --> 13:18.788
- Please.
- So you're alright then?

13:18.813 --> 13:20.279
Oh, I'm right as rain.

13:22.148 --> 13:23.437
Is that...

13:23.462 --> 13:26.696
Oh, that came out of the first well.

13:26.721 --> 13:28.220
I've been keeping it

13:28.245 --> 13:30.718
just to remind us about
where we started.

13:31.603 --> 13:35.273
Seems like a lot of foolishness
to think about it now.

13:35.785 --> 13:38.444
I thought you and Lucas
were figuring out a plan.

13:38.921 --> 13:41.322
I guess he hasn't told
you everything yet.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.760
I thought that my partner
was gonna stick with me

13:43.785 --> 13:47.370
but I just don't think he
has the stomach for it.

13:48.023 --> 13:49.371
What do you mean?

13:49.396 --> 13:51.274
Lucas pulled out.

13:51.523 --> 13:52.780
When did that happen?

13:52.805 --> 13:53.959
Yesterday.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.662
I just-I just don't think

13:55.687 --> 13:58.086
that I can keep this
thing going without him.

13:58.894 --> 14:00.424
So you're closing?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.552
It seems inevitable.

14:06.022 --> 14:08.140
That was a great meal. Thank you.

14:08.201 --> 14:11.084
Well, I suppose I'll get
these out of the way.

14:11.109 --> 14:13.662
- I'll help.
- No, no. No, no.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.883
You two have a lot to catch up on

14:16.908 --> 14:19.795
so go right ahead.

14:24.136 --> 14:27.993
Uh... so, Bellingham.

14:28.456 --> 14:29.585
Yes.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.901
What uh-thank you, hon.

14:31.926 --> 14:33.574
What took you to Bellingham?

14:33.830 --> 14:36.209
Our furniture store. My
husband and I run it.

14:36.649 --> 14:37.714
Oh.

14:37.739 --> 14:40.463
Did you know that Lee owns a sawmill?

14:40.893 --> 14:41.976
I didn't.

14:42.001 --> 14:43.214
Yeah.

14:43.239 --> 14:47.971
So he provides lumber and you
sell things made from it.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.808
Mmmhmm.

14:49.962 --> 14:51.746
That's a coincidence.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.386
It certainly is.

14:56.469 --> 14:58.335
Thank you, hon.

14:58.768 --> 15:02.370
Um... how is your husband doing?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.915
Jake is good.

15:04.006 --> 15:05.384
Good.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.202
And we have a son in college now

15:08.227 --> 15:10.202
and a daughter in her
last year of high school.

15:10.227 --> 15:11.626
- Really?
- Oh.

15:11.651 --> 15:13.163
Already grown.

15:14.105 --> 15:15.958
What about you two? No kids?

15:17.718 --> 15:20.712
Ah, well, that hasn't happened for us.

15:20.934 --> 15:22.266
Not yet.

15:23.044 --> 15:24.310
Oh.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.800
But there is a little
boy who lives next door

15:26.825 --> 15:28.993
and we are very close with him.

15:29.018 --> 15:30.584
Very close.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.165
Well, it's getting late.
I should be going.

15:37.234 --> 15:40.316
Oh, oh, oh, going where?

15:40.724 --> 15:42.126
To the hotel.

15:42.384 --> 15:43.531
Oh, don't be silly.

15:43.556 --> 15:45.727
No, you'll be staying right here.

15:45.752 --> 15:47.666
I've already made up the guest room.

15:48.074 --> 15:51.342
That's very kind but I think I
would feel more comfortable

15:51.367 --> 15:52.869
at the hotel.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.788
It's alright.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.790
We completely understand.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.759
Alright.

16:08.469 --> 16:09.901
I'll be right back.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.300
This is a pleasant surprise.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.681
Is it true?

16:14.741 --> 16:15.907
Is what true?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.858
Henry said you're pulling
out of the company.

16:17.892 --> 16:20.438
Are you going to let it go bankrupt?

16:22.337 --> 16:24.845
It's a little more
complicated than that.

16:31.055 --> 16:32.742
Is it true?

16:33.252 --> 16:34.317
Yes.

16:34.342 --> 16:35.662
Lucas.

16:36.104 --> 16:38.672
So many people in this town
depend on you and Henry

16:38.697 --> 16:40.235
for their livelihoods.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.173
How could you do this to them?

16:42.339 --> 16:44.129
I had no choice.

16:45.541 --> 16:47.674
I've been paying the men
out of my own pocket,

16:47.773 --> 16:49.551
fending off our vendors.

16:50.116 --> 16:52.303
I just can't afford to keep doing it.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.891
Henry didn't mention that.

16:56.536 --> 16:58.769
I'm sure he didn't
mention a lot of things.

17:00.919 --> 17:04.921
The way Henry ran our company,
undercutting the competition,

17:04.955 --> 17:06.733
expanding too quickly.

17:06.887 --> 17:09.029
That is what got us into this mess.

17:10.653 --> 17:14.909
I just can't afford to keep
throwing good money after bad.

17:15.270 --> 17:17.002
I told him the best thing to do would be

17:17.028 --> 17:20.082
to suspend all operation until
we can figure this out.

17:20.461 --> 17:22.667
He wasn't willing to do that.

17:26.894 --> 17:28.214
I'm sorry.

17:29.523 --> 17:32.051
I really shouldn't have
come in here like this.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.306
I should have given you
the benefit of the doubt.

17:38.043 --> 17:40.602
I can't fault you for caring too much.

17:43.886 --> 17:46.775
Henry is just so proud of this company.

17:47.882 --> 17:50.695
All those workers and their families.

17:51.325 --> 17:53.490
It must be such a weight
on his shoulders.

17:54.693 --> 17:57.243
It's no wonder he ended up
in the infirmary yesterday.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.250
I hadn't heard.

17:59.504 --> 18:00.955
Is he alright?

18:01.293 --> 18:02.384
I hope so.

18:02.409 --> 18:03.876
He's up and about.

18:07.030 --> 18:09.088
I wish I could have
done more to help him.

18:09.315 --> 18:12.510
Lucas, you did what you could.

18:13.429 --> 18:15.428
It's not your fault.

18:24.133 --> 18:25.675
Florence, why don't you let Molly know

18:25.700 --> 18:27.082
what the job entails?

18:27.107 --> 18:30.035
Me? But you're the lead operator.

18:30.060 --> 18:33.447
Well, you'll be taking over
so you might as well start.

18:36.092 --> 18:37.526
Are you OK?

18:40.035 --> 18:41.746
I'm fine.

18:43.345 --> 18:44.667
Florence?

18:46.596 --> 18:49.484
Well, first and foremost an operator

18:49.497 --> 18:51.478
has a strict code of discretion.

18:51.503 --> 18:53.476
We don't listen to any
more than ten seconds

18:53.501 --> 18:55.468
of any telephone conversation.

18:56.277 --> 18:57.763
Of course.

18:58.074 --> 18:59.891
No, I am serious.

19:02.735 --> 19:04.064
Oh.

19:04.373 --> 19:05.687
Yes.

19:19.503 --> 19:20.785
Who is it?

19:20.814 --> 19:22.705
<i>Uh, it's me. Leland.</i>

19:27.683 --> 19:28.815
Hi.

19:28.936 --> 19:30.253
Hi.

19:30.907 --> 19:32.206
What're you doing?

19:32.342 --> 19:35.425
I was about to get ready for bed.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.927
But it's 7:00.

19:38.837 --> 19:41.681
I'm used to getting up early
with the kids and our store.

19:42.119 --> 19:43.349
OK.

19:43.374 --> 19:46.481
Oh, I remembered how much you
used to love sarsaparilla

19:46.506 --> 19:48.522
so I brought you a bottle.

19:48.659 --> 19:50.773
I haven't liked that in a long time.

19:51.486 --> 19:52.942
Oh.

19:53.547 --> 19:54.820
Hmm.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.615
Come in.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.933
You sure?

20:00.961 --> 20:02.369
Please.

20:09.448 --> 20:10.581
You have a minute?

20:10.678 --> 20:12.895
Actually, I'm quite busy right now

20:12.920 --> 20:15.591
given that my partner has
just pulled out on me.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.856
I've heard that you're not feeling well.

20:18.881 --> 20:19.910
I'm fine.

20:19.935 --> 20:21.971
It's not any of your concern.

20:22.169 --> 20:23.771
Despite our current situation

20:23.796 --> 20:26.856
I still think you're a good
man so yes it is my concern.

20:26.881 --> 20:27.918
I'm fine.

20:27.943 --> 20:30.649
I'm just drafting up the terms of
the release of the partnership

20:30.674 --> 20:31.940
which you requested.

20:32.901 --> 20:34.694
That might not be necessary.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.317
How's that?

20:37.576 --> 20:39.906
This company means a lot to this town.

20:40.099 --> 20:42.996
If we go under it doesn't
affect just you and me.

20:43.275 --> 20:46.412
Families will move.
Businesses will suffer.

20:46.505 --> 20:47.831
True.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.770
I will agree to remain your
partner on one condition.

20:52.650 --> 20:54.560
I need to be majority owner.

20:54.736 --> 20:56.102
I'll give you a fair price

20:56.127 --> 20:57.926
<i>for the additional
shares of the company.</i>

20:58.255 --> 20:59.886
You can't be serious.

20:59.976 --> 21:01.200
I am.

21:01.245 --> 21:02.810
Why would I do that?

21:02.835 --> 21:04.646
Because you're a smart man

21:04.842 --> 21:06.942
and you recognize that you're
running out of options.

21:07.316 --> 21:08.648
<i>This is a fair deal.</i>

21:08.673 --> 21:09.941
<i>I suggest you consider it.</i>

21:09.966 --> 21:11.943
I can give you my answer now.

21:13.372 --> 21:16.349
No. And there is the door.

21:34.222 --> 21:36.589
What was I, about four there?

21:36.614 --> 21:37.981
Around that.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.518
Gee.

21:41.412 --> 21:44.245
I don't remember any of these photos.

21:45.662 --> 21:48.471
I haven't looked at these
in such a long time.

21:48.692 --> 21:50.714
I'm so glad you brought them.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.042
I still miss him so much.

22:05.469 --> 22:06.868
Me too.

22:10.045 --> 22:12.237
Things were just never the same after.

22:12.736 --> 22:14.737
Mom couldn't bear the grief.

22:15.740 --> 22:17.307
Neither could Dad.

22:17.603 --> 22:20.979
I know. At least he got
a couple more years.

22:21.344 --> 22:25.620
But at the end all he could
talk about was Patrick and Mom.

22:27.176 --> 22:29.323
You'd know that if you'd been around.

22:33.867 --> 22:36.034
I didn't know that he was sick.

22:36.952 --> 22:38.940
I wish you would have
said something to me.

22:39.543 --> 22:41.675
At first he made me promise not to.

22:41.711 --> 22:43.299
You should have told me.

22:44.482 --> 22:46.845
I keep my promises, and
don't make this about me.

22:46.870 --> 22:48.432
You're the one who couldn't be bothered

22:48.457 --> 22:49.889
to come home for two years.

22:49.914 --> 22:51.878
You're the one who didn't
make it to his funeral.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.360
I didn't make it back to the funeral

22:53.385 --> 22:55.010
because I didn't get
your letter in time.

22:55.035 --> 22:56.935
I sent it a month before he died.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.494
I was travelling that month.

22:58.519 --> 23:00.026
Good for you. Guess where I was?

23:00.051 --> 23:02.393
At home, caring for our dying father.

23:08.323 --> 23:09.354
Listen, Suse, I...

23:09.379 --> 23:11.174
It's Susannah.

23:11.915 --> 23:13.963
And I'm tired and I'd like to go to bed.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.971
Oh dear.

23:46.478 --> 23:48.727
Would you like to talk about it?

23:50.090 --> 23:51.156
Nope.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.278
I'm gonna go to bed. You coming?

23:53.691 --> 23:55.322
Just a few more minutes.

24:02.124 --> 24:05.712
We had ourselves a nice little
run going there, didn't we?

24:08.562 --> 24:10.095
You're up early.

24:10.467 --> 24:13.431
Just shaking off the cobwebs
before school starts.

24:14.971 --> 24:16.804
You know, I find it hard to believe

24:16.829 --> 24:19.048
you have any cobwebs up there.

24:24.077 --> 24:26.806
Here, why don't I... let me help you.

24:26.963 --> 24:29.595
Can't have our famous
author hurting her hands.

24:29.653 --> 24:31.322
Ha ha, very funny.

24:31.373 --> 24:33.356
Seriously though, um,

24:33.970 --> 24:36.661
I'm happy the publisher
realized how special you are.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.012
Oh...

24:39.729 --> 24:41.395
He's not the only one.

24:43.832 --> 24:45.232
Thank you.

24:46.902 --> 24:52.130
Elizabeth, um... I was
wondering if you...

24:52.731 --> 24:54.007
if you weren't...

24:57.713 --> 25:00.716
What I was gonna say is
if you were not uh...

25:05.141 --> 25:06.684
Yes?

25:07.699 --> 25:09.505
Maybe another time.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.279
Who is it?

25:21.304 --> 25:22.937
<i>It's me. Rosemary.</i>

25:27.209 --> 25:28.893
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

25:28.918 --> 25:30.043
Actually, I was just about...

25:30.068 --> 25:31.935
It'll only take a minute.

25:35.965 --> 25:38.573
I don't know all of what
went on between you and Lee,

25:39.586 --> 25:41.275
but it's time to let it go.

25:41.980 --> 25:43.680
I tried.

25:45.728 --> 25:47.634
Lee almost died last week.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.361
He what?

25:49.396 --> 25:51.065
It was a work accident.

25:53.159 --> 25:54.908
Scariest time of my life.

25:56.239 --> 25:57.729
When he woke up,

25:58.739 --> 26:00.451
he said he didn't want
to leave this earth

26:00.476 --> 26:02.713
without reconciling with you.

26:04.611 --> 26:06.812
Now, I don't know what Lee
was like 20 years ago,

26:06.967 --> 26:08.818
but the Lee I know today?

26:09.296 --> 26:13.396
He's a good man, with a big heart.

26:19.722 --> 26:21.354
I'm heading home.

26:24.264 --> 26:27.159
You came all this way.

26:28.894 --> 26:32.196
There must be a part of you that
wants to reconnect with him.

26:33.639 --> 26:36.815
You already lost one brother.

26:38.345 --> 26:40.526
Do you really wanna lose another?

26:48.517 --> 26:49.768
Elizabeth?

26:51.467 --> 26:52.587
Hi.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.831
Hi.

26:55.315 --> 26:56.924
I made Henry an offer.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.815
What kind of offer?

26:59.599 --> 27:02.248
The only kind that would keep
me in business with him.

27:02.344 --> 27:03.982
What did he say?

27:05.073 --> 27:06.381
No.

27:10.543 --> 27:13.334
Well, I appreciate you
doing what you could.

27:16.215 --> 27:17.639
You know what?

27:18.851 --> 27:20.480
You just made a book deal.

27:21.053 --> 27:23.535
Instead of being sad we
should be celebrating.

27:23.999 --> 27:27.768
Lucas, I just feel bad about
all of those oil employees.

27:27.827 --> 27:30.019
I understand. I do too.

27:30.113 --> 27:32.406
But life is too short not to
appreciate the good things

27:32.431 --> 27:33.785
when they happen.

27:34.166 --> 27:35.690
Can you meet me tonight?

27:35.715 --> 27:37.222
In the library?

27:47.121 --> 27:48.769
When are you leaving?

27:49.729 --> 27:51.229
Tomorrow.

27:51.917 --> 27:53.605
<i>I'm sorry to see you go.</i>

27:54.333 --> 27:56.433
Eh, it's just part of the job.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.535
<i>Here one day, gone another.</i>

27:59.157 --> 28:00.761
Is this what you want?

28:01.259 --> 28:03.886
Someone needs to install
these new phone lines.

28:04.629 --> 28:06.300
Is this what you want?

28:09.891 --> 28:12.628
I should be grateful to even have a job.

28:15.285 --> 28:16.660
Fiona.

28:21.245 --> 28:26.244
I'm just a very small cog
in a big wheel and...

28:28.095 --> 28:29.626
dispensable.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.294
Now why would you say that?

28:33.119 --> 28:35.234
Because that's what my boss told me.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.852
You are neither small nor dispensable.

28:39.129 --> 28:41.637
You shouldn't let anyone
make you feel that way.

28:49.406 --> 28:51.907
Now are you gonna have a
nice big bite of yams?

28:52.058 --> 28:53.725
Oh, that's not what we want.

28:53.817 --> 28:56.152
<i>You are not eating your yams tonight.</i>

28:56.420 --> 28:58.717
And you aren't eating anything tonight.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.409
I'm just not hungry. That's all.

29:06.823 --> 29:08.873
I wonder who that could be.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.779
Alright.

29:10.948 --> 29:12.835
Do you want to try a bean?

29:14.287 --> 29:15.546
Susannah.

29:15.834 --> 29:17.090
Hi, Leland.

29:17.316 --> 29:20.009
Hi. Um, please. Come in.

29:22.273 --> 29:23.721
Rosemary.

29:24.113 --> 29:25.556
Susannah.

29:26.079 --> 29:27.666
- I'm interrupting.
- No, no, no.

29:27.691 --> 29:29.852
No, no. Please, join us.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.509
Is this the little boy
you were talking about?

29:33.534 --> 29:35.983
Yes. This is little Jack.

29:36.285 --> 29:38.736
He reminds me of my son, Patrick.

29:41.842 --> 29:43.533
You named your son Patrick?

29:43.625 --> 29:45.159
Mmmhmm.

29:50.106 --> 29:51.707
It's a good name.

29:59.419 --> 30:00.985
Thank you for meeting me.

30:01.061 --> 30:02.427
You're welcome.

30:03.637 --> 30:05.270
Shall we?

30:11.178 --> 30:14.045
Now, I know that this is not a date.

30:14.182 --> 30:16.564
But would you say that, as friends,

30:16.926 --> 30:19.944
we toast to your success
with a glass of champagne?

30:20.642 --> 30:22.947
I would like that very much.

30:24.643 --> 30:28.899
However, if this were a date,

30:30.220 --> 30:32.331
I would take your jacket.

30:45.662 --> 30:47.128
Thank you.

30:53.377 --> 30:55.980
I would also pull your
chair out for you.

31:10.426 --> 31:12.852
And I might even gently brush your hand

31:13.203 --> 31:15.508
as I pass you your glass,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.129
and hold your gaze for
longer than normal.

31:27.732 --> 31:30.431
And I would think that was very sweet.

31:53.790 --> 31:55.574
Well, here we are.

31:56.259 --> 31:58.876
I'm not surprised you've
been such a success.

32:00.053 --> 32:01.670
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

32:01.805 --> 32:03.985
I remember how all us
kids in the neighbourhood

32:04.010 --> 32:06.602
would spend whatever we
had on candy and soda

32:06.627 --> 32:08.650
- but not you.
- Yeah.

32:08.675 --> 32:10.954
You were always filling
up your piggy bank.

32:11.087 --> 32:12.220
Maybe.

32:12.245 --> 32:13.937
But then I'd always come running to you

32:13.962 --> 32:15.822
- for a bite of your candy.
- Mmmhmm.

32:16.715 --> 32:18.048
Never more than a bite, though.

32:18.073 --> 32:19.272
No.

32:19.359 --> 32:21.398
No, never more than a bite.

32:26.592 --> 32:28.356
It was hard. Dad didn't
want me to tell you,

32:28.381 --> 32:30.014
he kept thinking he would get better.

32:30.039 --> 32:34.203
No, you do not have to
apologize for anything.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.205
You were there.

32:36.607 --> 32:38.207
Taking care of him.

32:38.254 --> 32:39.667
You did the best you could.

32:39.692 --> 32:40.974
I'm the one who wasn't there.

32:40.999 --> 32:42.983
- That's my fault.
- Leland, I...

32:43.008 --> 32:45.780
No, no, no. I need to say this.

32:45.945 --> 32:47.925
I was so lost.

32:49.087 --> 32:50.804
And so angry.

32:51.283 --> 32:52.972
And because of that

32:53.114 --> 32:57.351
I never got a chance
to say that I'm sorry.

32:58.132 --> 33:00.271
I'm sorry for not being there.

33:00.861 --> 33:02.606
And thank you.

33:03.205 --> 33:07.487
Thank you so much for taking
such good care of our father.

33:07.729 --> 33:12.282
And thank you for bearing that
all by yourself. I can't...

33:13.262 --> 33:16.079
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been.

33:17.289 --> 33:18.613
Oh, Leland.

33:18.732 --> 33:21.708
I wish I could take back
these last 20 years.

33:22.315 --> 33:24.211
You and me both.

33:30.563 --> 33:31.689
Goodnight.

33:31.714 --> 33:32.928
Goodnight.

33:57.986 --> 34:01.124
Yes, this is Fiona Miller for Mr.
Nichols.

34:01.559 --> 34:02.824
Thanks.

34:06.861 --> 34:08.464
Mr. Nichols.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.571
I would like to talk to you
about how you spoke to me

34:11.596 --> 34:12.967
the other day.

34:34.163 --> 34:35.562
Standing guard?

34:38.367 --> 34:39.954
Kind of, yeah.

34:40.513 --> 34:41.701
Actually, I'm waiting.

34:41.726 --> 34:43.248
For?

34:43.360 --> 34:44.926
For them.

34:47.214 --> 34:48.313
Oh.

34:48.339 --> 34:50.318
I'm heading out of town for a few days

34:50.507 --> 34:53.155
so Opal's mom will be
dropping Allie off at school.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.878
Well, thank you for letting me know.

35:09.731 --> 35:10.964
Elizabeth?

35:11.696 --> 35:13.445
Would you like to get dinner with me?

35:14.339 --> 35:17.366
When I get back? Maybe at the cafe?

35:19.810 --> 35:21.005
I'll tell you what.

35:21.030 --> 35:24.898
Why don't you think about
it and you can let me know.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.434
I won't sell you majority ownership.

35:39.459 --> 35:41.366
- Yes, you've...
- Let me finish.

35:41.528 --> 35:44.477
But if you think that you can
run my company better than me,

35:44.869 --> 35:46.235
buy me out.

35:46.293 --> 35:47.896
Lock, stock, and barrel.

35:47.921 --> 35:50.607
Think about it. But not too long.

35:58.318 --> 35:59.952
See you in Buxton.

36:09.011 --> 36:10.176
Nathan!

36:12.614 --> 36:13.813
Let's go!

36:14.694 --> 36:16.961
What? I thought we'd
leave in a few hours.

36:19.111 --> 36:20.343
But now is good, too.

36:20.368 --> 36:22.801
Hold on, let me just get my things.

36:36.517 --> 36:37.947
What's going on?

36:39.048 --> 36:40.699
Henry's out.

36:41.141 --> 36:43.160
Well, I can see that.

36:43.902 --> 36:47.330
No, I mean he's... he's out.

36:48.179 --> 36:51.085
I now have complete control
over Gowen Petroleum.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.754
I don't understand.

36:55.303 --> 36:56.966
Is that what you proposed?

36:57.319 --> 36:58.719
No.

36:58.856 --> 37:00.802
But that's how it ended up.

37:02.251 --> 37:03.715
The thing is

37:04.613 --> 37:07.225
I know next to nothing
about the oil business.

37:25.085 --> 37:26.912
Take out your guns!

37:27.730 --> 37:28.903
Slowly!

37:28.928 --> 37:30.961
And throw them down! All of you!

37:31.023 --> 37:33.211
<i>OK. Take it easy.</i>

37:33.807 --> 37:35.506
What's this all about?

37:37.165 --> 37:38.598
Jenny!

37:38.680 --> 37:40.676
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

37:42.508 --> 37:43.842
Let him go!

37:44.455 --> 37:45.620
OK, look.

37:45.645 --> 37:47.517
Nobody has to get hurt.

37:47.935 --> 37:50.018
Then do what I say!

37:50.776 --> 37:53.378
I'm gonna try to help you out here, OK?

37:53.558 --> 37:55.158
Elias, he's your husband?

37:55.225 --> 37:58.069
Ew, no. He's my brother.

37:58.839 --> 37:59.945
OK.

37:59.970 --> 38:06.272
Um... look, your brother is
looking at a few years, tops.

38:07.141 --> 38:09.841
If you break him out
you're both looking at 20.

38:09.944 --> 38:11.318
Jenny, don't listen to him.

38:11.343 --> 38:12.576
<i>No, you should listen.</i>

38:12.601 --> 38:13.700
I'm a judge.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.211
Twenty would be lenient in my courtroom.

38:18.059 --> 38:22.284
Look at me. Jenny, you're young, OK?

38:22.309 --> 38:23.719
You're smart.

38:24.349 --> 38:25.848
You don't want any of this.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.028
Give me the gun

38:27.053 --> 38:29.630
and we'll forget this ever happened.

38:31.761 --> 38:34.729
Cooperating would go a long way, Jenny.

38:36.367 --> 38:37.932
Give me the gun, OK?

38:38.101 --> 38:39.777
Everything's gonna be alright.

38:40.266 --> 38:41.889
<i>I promise.</i>

38:44.474 --> 38:46.366
- No! Don't!
- Jenny, watch out!

38:51.842 --> 38:53.842
So, we are not gonna wait
another twenty years

38:53.867 --> 38:55.366
before we see each other again, right?

38:55.391 --> 38:57.248
- I hope not.
- Thank you.

38:57.922 --> 39:00.545
We're actually going to
Los Angeles next week.

39:00.570 --> 39:01.570
That's right.

39:01.595 --> 39:03.412
Maybe we could stop in
Bellingham on our way.

39:03.437 --> 39:04.437
Yes!

39:04.462 --> 39:05.700
My son will be home that weekend.

39:05.725 --> 39:06.944
You can meet my whole family.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.116
That's great.

39:08.141 --> 39:10.725
Actually, with you there it
will be my whole family.

39:11.951 --> 39:13.466
I love the sound of that.

39:13.507 --> 39:15.007
Thank you.

39:17.372 --> 39:20.026
It's so good to see you again, sis.

39:24.671 --> 39:26.115
Thank you.

39:27.058 --> 39:28.825
My pleasure.

39:36.445 --> 39:39.676
Oh, and tell your kids they're
about to meet the best aunt

39:39.701 --> 39:40.892
in the whole world.

39:40.917 --> 39:42.757
- Lee.
- It's true.

39:51.531 --> 39:53.016
Thank you, Rosemary.

39:53.532 --> 39:55.019
For what?

39:56.263 --> 39:57.902
Just for being you.

40:11.717 --> 40:13.183
You look happy.

40:13.352 --> 40:14.747
Good news?

40:15.072 --> 40:18.358
Good and bad.

40:18.793 --> 40:20.460
What do you mean?

40:21.192 --> 40:23.296
I'm staying in Hope Valley.

40:23.528 --> 40:26.217
Well, that's-that's great news.

40:26.464 --> 40:28.129
What's the bad?

40:28.736 --> 40:30.553
I was fired today.

40:30.898 --> 40:32.473
Fired?

40:33.840 --> 40:35.934
Maybe I quit.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.121
No, I was definitely fired.

40:40.784 --> 40:42.049
Why?

40:42.213 --> 40:47.238
Because I'm not small and
I told my boss that.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.829
Fiona, I am so sorry.

40:50.854 --> 40:53.229
I didn't mean for that to happen.

40:53.254 --> 40:55.787
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it.

40:59.382 --> 41:01.252
You know, I love it here.

41:01.739 --> 41:02.771
But you never know.

41:02.796 --> 41:05.630
I might leave someday for the right job.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.346
But this wasn't it.

41:09.586 --> 41:11.177
So thanks.

41:11.464 --> 41:12.888
You're welcome.

41:12.913 --> 41:14.090
Cheers.

41:14.115 --> 41:16.183
Yeah, cheers.

41:18.201 --> 41:20.935
Ya! Ya! Ya!

41:20.960 --> 41:22.059
Ya!

41:22.112 --> 41:24.162
Carson, I got a gunshot wound!

41:24.187 --> 41:26.021
Woah! Woah! Woah!

41:29.221 --> 41:31.422
Ned, Carson needs extra
gauze and bandages,

41:31.447 --> 41:32.673
whatever you have!

41:32.698 --> 41:33.716
Wh-what happened?

41:33.741 --> 41:35.273
Someone's been shot!

41:35.714 --> 41:38.048
