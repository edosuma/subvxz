00:09.209 --> 00:12.209
Check it out. I made a

00:09.209 --> 00:12.209
friendship bracelet for Skylar.

00:12.250 --> 00:16.209
Congratulations. You are now

00:12.250 --> 00:16.209
officially a nine-year-old girl.

00:17.876 --> 00:19.250
This is coal.

00:19.292 --> 00:21.417
You're giving her

00:19.292 --> 00:21.417
a bracelet made of coal?

00:21.459 --> 00:23.167
Nope.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.918
[grunts]

00:30.375 --> 00:34.042
Diamonds. Thanks, Crusher.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.209
Why are you giving her this?

00:35.250 --> 00:37.584
Because I care about her,

00:35.250 --> 00:37.584
as a friend.

00:37.626 --> 00:40.042
And if she happens to thank me

00:37.626 --> 00:40.042
with a giant hug and kiss,

00:40.083 --> 00:42.000
I'll have to live with that.

The coolest, of course,

00:50.083 --> 00:54.876
is Billy Fowler.

00:56.459 --> 00:58.959
Because he does this.

01:00.334 --> 01:04.042
Look at him! He's so amazing,

01:00.334 --> 01:04.042
with his magnetic powers

01:04.083 --> 01:05.375

01:04.083 --> 01:05.375

01:05.417 --> 01:06.959

01:11.083 --> 01:14.876
Experion! I can't believe it!

01:11.083 --> 01:14.876

We used to live

next door to each other.

02:21.626 --> 02:24.626
Well, I'm Oliver. I'm her

02:21.626 --> 02:24.626
best friend from this planet.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.209
And I used to live

02:24.667 --> 02:28.209
next door to an Armenian deli.

And I'm Kaz. And you're

02:36.375 --> 02:40.459
Nice to meet you. Twice.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.626
So, I heard you were

02:40.500 --> 02:45.626
ambushed by the Annihilator

02:40.500 --> 02:45.626
and lost your powers.

02:45.667 --> 02:49.459
But don't worry,

02:45.667 --> 02:49.459
I'll find a way

02:45.667 --> 02:49.459
to get them back for you, Sky.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.417
That's cool.

the first thing I do.

02:59.167 --> 03:04.334
Actually, before you do that,

02:59.167 --> 03:04.334
can you use your magnetic

07:12.751 --> 07:14.042
This is ridiculous.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.542
And I made you croissants

07:14.083 --> 07:16.542
yesterday morning.

07:16.584 --> 07:18.918
Those were crescent rolls!

07:18.959 --> 07:22.834
And yes, you were rude

07:18.959 --> 07:22.834
when you served them to me,

07:18.959 --> 07:22.834
but it's not the same!

07:25.792 --> 07:28.584
Good afternoon,

07:25.792 --> 07:28.584
fine human shopkeepers.

07:28.626 --> 07:31.709
I am a human comic book

07:28.626 --> 07:31.709
publisher, with a sure-fire

07:31.751 --> 07:34.751
human bestseller

07:31.751 --> 07:34.751
right here in my human hands.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.667
- Look, we'd like to help you.

07:34.792 --> 07:36.667
- No we wouldn't.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.626
Actually, he's right,

07:36.709 --> 07:38.626
we really wouldn't.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.667
Well, I will not take

07:38.667 --> 07:40.667
"no" for an answer.

07:40.709 --> 07:42.834
- So, will you read

07:40.709 --> 07:42.834
my comic book?

07:40.709 --> 07:42.834
- No.

07:42.876 --> 07:44.042
- Will you read

07:42.876 --> 07:44.042
my comic book?

07:42.876 --> 07:44.042
- No.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.292
- Will you read

07:44.083 --> 07:46.292
my comic book?

07:44.083 --> 07:46.292
- No.

07:46.334 --> 07:48.876
- Will you read my comic book?

07:46.334 --> 07:48.876
- Wow, He really will not take

07:46.334 --> 07:48.876
"no" for an answer.

07:48.918 --> 07:51.209
- Will you take

07:48.918 --> 07:51.209
"nyet" for an answer?

07:48.918 --> 07:51.209
- Nyet.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.042
- Will you take

07:51.250 --> 07:54.042
"Chigaimasu" for an answer?

07:51.250 --> 07:54.042
- Chigaimasu.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.918
Will you take...

07:54.083 --> 07:56.918
for an answer?

07:57.959 --> 07:59.918
OK, look, tell you what.

07:59.959 --> 08:03.542
Why don't you discuss this

07:59.959 --> 08:03.542
with our newly-hired

07:59.959 --> 08:03.542
comic book consultant.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.667
Gus, read this kid's comic

08:03.584 --> 08:05.667
and tell us what you think.

08:05.709 --> 08:09.042
- What's in it for me?

08:05.709 --> 08:09.042
- You get to ruthlessly

08:05.709 --> 08:09.042
judge someone.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.959
I'm in! You're ugly!

08:13.751 --> 08:16.959
No, not me! Him.

08:13.751 --> 08:16.959
And that hurt my feelings.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.626
Yeah, he's doing the best

08:17.000 --> 08:20.626
he can with what he's got.

08:23.751 --> 08:25.918
Before you make a decision

08:23.751 --> 08:25.918
about my comic book,

08:25.959 --> 08:28.709
I should tell you up front,

08:25.959 --> 08:28.709
I will not take "no"

08:25.959 --> 08:28.709
for an answer.

08:28.751 --> 08:33.708
Will you take... [speaks foreign

08:28.751 --> 08:33.708
language]... for an answer?

08:33.751 --> 08:37.458
[speaks foreign language]

08:38.542 --> 08:41.708
Fair enough.

08:41.751 --> 08:44.667
All right, Citadel, because

08:41.751 --> 08:44.667
of your impenetrable skin,

08:44.709 --> 08:48.000
I'll be using this

08:44.709 --> 08:48.000
highly sensitive,

08:44.709 --> 08:48.000
super-powerful stethoscope.

08:49.417 --> 08:52.042
- [whirring]

08:49.417 --> 08:52.042
- Oh, ahh! Oh!

08:52.083 --> 08:55.542
This is so powerful,

08:52.083 --> 08:55.542
I just heard a pin drop.

08:55.584 --> 08:58.792
A bowling pin. In Honduras.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.042
- Ah, that's better.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.042
- [heart beating]

09:03.083 --> 09:06.500
Now I only hear...

09:03.083 --> 09:06.500
[radio static] Experion?

09:06.542 --> 09:08.876
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">[Experion on radio]</font></i>

09:06.542 --> 09:08.876
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">The plan is working perfectly.</font></i>

09:08.918 --> 09:12.250
I'm going to sneak up on Skylar,

09:08.918 --> 09:12.250
and when she least expects it...

09:12.292 --> 09:14.042
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">...choke her!</font></i>

09:14.083 --> 09:17.292
She is going to die!

09:17.334 --> 09:22.667
Oh no! I knew I couldn't

09:17.334 --> 09:22.667
trust him, but he's even

09:17.334 --> 09:22.667
worse than I thought!

09:22.709 --> 09:25.375
Ahh! This is terrible!

09:25.417 --> 09:30.000
Sorry, I just heard Horace

09:25.417 --> 09:30.000
singing in the shower.

09:25.417 --> 09:30.000
He is butchering Beyonce!

09:35.918 --> 09:39.667
Oliver, what's so urgent?

09:35.918 --> 09:39.667
I dropped everything to be here.

09:39.709 --> 09:43.417
Which is really bad because

09:39.709 --> 09:43.417
I was holding my baby brother.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.667
And why did you text me to

09:43.459 --> 09:46.667
"Get black hair right now"?

09:46.709 --> 09:51.042
Stupid auto-correct! I meant,

09:46.709 --> 09:51.042
"Get back here right now."

09:51.083 --> 09:56.709
Oh. Then I will just

09:51.083 --> 09:56.709
keep this for myself.

09:56.751 --> 10:00.042
Look, I overheard Experion,

09:56.751 --> 10:00.042
and you're right, he doesn't

09:56.751 --> 10:00.042
want to be your boyfriend.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.751
- Told you.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.751
- He wants to be

10:00.083 --> 10:02.751
your ex-boyfriend,

10:02.792 --> 10:05.459
because he's going to kill you!

10:05.500 --> 10:08.042
Oliver, stop!

10:05.500 --> 10:08.042
Experion really cares about me.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.876
In fact, he's flying me

10:08.083 --> 10:10.876
back to my home planet.

10:10.918 --> 10:13.042
He thinks he found a way

10:10.918 --> 10:13.042
to restore my powers.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.042
No! You can't leave with him!

10:15.083 --> 10:18.000
I heard him say he's going

10:15.083 --> 10:18.000
to choke you when you

10:15.083 --> 10:18.000
least expect it!

10:18.042 --> 10:20.667
Enough! I have to go.

10:20.709 --> 10:24.500
Experion arranged

10:20.709 --> 10:24.500
a full spa treatment

10:20.709 --> 10:24.500
for me at five o'clock.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.626
Maybe I'll get

10:24.542 --> 10:27.626
my new hair done.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.709
Experion's going to attack

10:31.083 --> 10:33.709
her during the spa treatment!

10:33.751 --> 10:36.918
She'll be lulled into

10:33.751 --> 10:36.918
a defenseless state

10:33.751 --> 10:36.918
once she's soaking her feet

10:36.959 --> 10:42.042
in herbal hot water, with warm

10:36.959 --> 10:42.042
wax on her hands, inhaling the

10:36.959 --> 10:42.042
aromatherapy eye pillow.

10:42.083 --> 10:46.042
You know a crazy amount

10:42.083 --> 10:46.042
about spa treatments.

10:46.083 --> 10:50.000
Mother-son bonding time.

10:46.083 --> 10:50.000
Don't judge me!

10:50.042 --> 10:52.876
Experion has everyone fooled,

10:50.042 --> 10:52.876
but he's so two-faced.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.834
Just like the two-faced villain

10:52.918 --> 10:55.834
in <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> The Crusher Returns.</font></i>

10:55.876 --> 10:58.834
That guy had

10:55.876 --> 10:58.834
the best catchphrase:

10:58.876 --> 11:02.959
"Why don't you say that

10:58.876 --> 11:02.959
to my face?! Or my other face."

11:04.083 --> 11:06.709
Wait! I have an idea.

11:06.751 --> 11:11.751
I can use Skylar as bait to

11:06.751 --> 11:11.751
trick Experion into revealing

11:06.751 --> 11:11.751
his true villainous self.

11:11.792 --> 11:14.918
How is Skylar

11:11.792 --> 11:14.918
going to be your bait

11:11.792 --> 11:14.918
if she doesn't believe you?

11:14.959 --> 11:17.459
I know a way.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.542
Aha!

11:32.792 --> 11:36.667
Trying to strangle

11:32.792 --> 11:36.667
Skylar, are you?

11:36.709 --> 11:38.500
Wait, what?

11:38.542 --> 11:43.959
Well, you can't,

11:38.542 --> 11:43.959
because I'm not Skylar!

11:44.000 --> 11:48.959
Yeah, I know. You look nothing

11:44.000 --> 11:48.959
like Skylar. She has chestnut

11:44.000 --> 11:48.959
brown hair with a pink streak.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.626
And you have black horse hair

11:49.000 --> 11:54.626
with a fruit strip in it.

11:54.667 --> 11:58.584
It was the only wig

11:54.667 --> 11:58.584
I could find!

11:54.667 --> 11:58.584
She had a wig, I borrowed it!

11:58.626 --> 12:01.000
I don't have

11:58.626 --> 12:01.000
easy access to wigs!

12:02.083 --> 12:03.876
Um, what's going on?

12:03.918 --> 12:07.792
I... I caught Experion

12:03.918 --> 12:07.792
trying to kill you!

12:07.834 --> 12:11.834
And Kaz has

12:07.834 --> 12:11.834
the whole thing on his phone!

12:11.876 --> 12:17.542
Yeah, um... about that.

12:11.876 --> 12:17.542
I forgot to hit

12:11.876 --> 12:17.542
the "record" button.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.042
Hey, can you

12:19.083 --> 12:22.042
come in again?

12:22.083 --> 12:25.209
Skylar, I don't know what

12:22.083 --> 12:25.209
Oliver's talking about.

12:25.250 --> 12:30.959
[scoffs] Give it up! I heard you

12:25.250 --> 12:30.959
say you were going to choke her,

12:25.250 --> 12:30.959
and you're holding a chain!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.042
Oh, he's got you there!

12:33.083 --> 12:37.834
Yeah, I do have a chain.

12:33.083 --> 12:37.834
It's a 14-carat gold <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> choker.</font></i>

12:37.876 --> 12:40.792
- It's a present.

12:37.876 --> 12:40.792
- Oops. Twist!

12:42.792 --> 12:45.709
But I heard you say,

12:42.792 --> 12:45.709
"She's going to die!"

12:45.751 --> 12:48.792
From excitement,

12:45.751 --> 12:48.792
after seeing the choker.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.083
It's beautiful!

12:48.834 --> 12:51.083
I could just die!

12:52.292 --> 12:54.167
Told ya.

12:54.209 --> 12:57.709
He did. You just got told.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.918
Oliver, what is wrong

13:01.000 --> 13:04.918
with you? I told you

13:01.000 --> 13:04.918
he wasn't trying to kill me.

13:04.959 --> 13:09.042
Or... was he trying

13:04.959 --> 13:09.042
to kill you with kindness?

13:09.083 --> 13:11.751
- Just go.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.751
- OK.

13:14.918 --> 13:16.584
Later, buddy!

13:21.083 --> 13:24.083
I've been working on that.

13:24.125 --> 13:29.042
I'm Sorry about Oliver.

13:24.125 --> 13:29.042
He's just trying to protect me.

13:24.125 --> 13:29.042
He's actually a good guy.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.792
He should try to protect you.

13:31.834 --> 13:36.042
Because...

13:31.834 --> 13:36.042
I'm actually a bad guy.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.876
What?

13:42.083 --> 13:44.792
I can't move.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.792
Why are you doing this?

13:44.834 --> 13:46.751
I'm working for the Annihilator.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.792
He's worried you'll get your

13:46.792 --> 13:49.792
powers back and seek revenge.

13:49.834 --> 13:53.083
So he wants me

13:49.834 --> 13:53.083
to deliver you to him.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.083
- You can't do this!

13:53.125 --> 13:56.083
- Sure I can.

13:56.125 --> 14:00.000
It's so easy, it's like taking

13:56.125 --> 14:00.000
diarrhea from a baby.

14:08.667 --> 14:12.209
So I read your book,

14:08.667 --> 14:12.209
and I must say...

14:12.250 --> 14:15.125
I loved it!

14:12.250 --> 14:15.125
That's fantastic!

14:15.167 --> 14:18.167
I do have a few

14:15.167 --> 14:18.167
small questions:

14:18.209 --> 14:24.626
do the three blind mice

14:18.209 --> 14:24.626
have to be mice?

14:18.209 --> 14:24.626
Can they be ninjas instead?

14:26.083 --> 14:28.792
And does the old woman

14:26.083 --> 14:28.792
have to live in a shoe?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.876
That doesn't feel

14:28.834 --> 14:31.876
very aspirational.

14:31.918 --> 14:37.042
- What are you talking about?

14:31.918 --> 14:37.042
- Your story.

14:37.083 --> 14:43.042
What?! You read the wrong thing!

14:37.083 --> 14:43.042
This is a book of nursery

14:37.083 --> 14:43.042
rhymes.

14:43.083 --> 14:48.792
Fine. Then pitch me your idea,

14:43.083 --> 14:48.792
Mary Mary Quite Contrary.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.125
Clyde, that's not going to work.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.751
You're wasting your time staring

14:51.167 --> 14:53.751
all day at that vision board.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.709
That's not true.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.709
It's helped me achieve

14:53.792 --> 14:56.709
my first life goal:

14:56.751 --> 14:59.876
to stare all day

14:56.751 --> 14:59.876
at a vision board.

14:59.918 --> 15:03.042
Well, I'm gonna come up

14:59.918 --> 15:03.042
with a more concrete plan,

15:03.083 --> 15:08.292
while you wait for someone

15:03.083 --> 15:08.292
to magically blurt out

15:03.083 --> 15:08.292
all the secrets to Mighty Med...

15:08.334 --> 15:14.709
My comic is about a not-at-all

15:08.334 --> 15:14.709
awkward superhero who works at

15:08.334 --> 15:14.709
a top-secret hospital called...

15:14.751 --> 15:16.751
- ..."Mighty Med."

15:14.751 --> 15:16.751
- [jack-hammering]

15:19.751 --> 15:21.125
Step one of my plan,

15:21.167 --> 15:26.042
create a network of tunnels

15:21.167 --> 15:26.042
until we find the entrance.

15:26.083 --> 15:29.334
There, he toils under the reign

15:26.083 --> 15:29.334
of his far-less-attractive,

15:29.375 --> 15:33.959
- bridge-loving uncle,

15:29.375 --> 15:33.959
Horace Diaz.

15:29.375 --> 15:33.959
- [blender whirring]

15:34.000 --> 15:39.751
Step two, toast our victory

15:34.000 --> 15:39.751
with these delicious smoothies.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.292
And the twist

15:39.792 --> 15:41.292
is that the location

15:41.334 --> 15:45.083
of this top secret

15:41.334 --> 15:45.083
superhero hospital

15:41.334 --> 15:45.083
is actually inside...

15:45.125 --> 15:47.375
- ...a real hospital.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.375
- [bagpipes playing]

15:52.292 --> 15:57.125
Step three, I play this dirge

15:52.292 --> 15:57.125
at the funeral of our nemesis!

15:57.167 --> 16:01.375
Sorry, no sale. The lead kid

15:57.167 --> 16:01.375
is kind of unlikable.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.834
Your face is kind of unlikable!

16:03.876 --> 16:06.250
Actually, I've been told

16:03.876 --> 16:06.250
I have a warm smile--

16:06.292 --> 16:08.334
I said kind of unlikable!

16:12.083 --> 16:16.042
Yeesh. Writers are so sensitive.

16:20.417 --> 16:23.834
Now we'll walk quietly

16:20.417 --> 16:23.834
out of this hospital together,

16:23.876 --> 16:27.042
and if you make

16:23.876 --> 16:27.042
the slightest move to escape,

16:23.876 --> 16:27.042
I'll immobilize you again,

16:27.083 --> 16:29.792
and destroy your

16:27.083 --> 16:29.792
little Normo friends.

16:31.083 --> 16:35.417
Skylar, we wanted to say

16:31.083 --> 16:35.417
good-bye and apologize.

16:35.459 --> 16:38.792
Experion, I'm sorry

16:35.459 --> 16:38.792
for what I said about you.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.042
And wrote about you

16:38.834 --> 16:41.042
in my feelings journal.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.959
He also drew a really mean

16:41.083 --> 16:43.959
picture of you in there--

16:44.000 --> 16:45.417
Hey! Stop reading my journal!

16:46.417 --> 16:49.000
Well, we really gotta go.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.834
Wait!

16:51.876 --> 16:55.042
Skylar, I'm really going to miss

16:51.876 --> 16:55.042
hanging out with you every day.

16:55.083 --> 16:58.042
So I got you

16:55.083 --> 16:58.042
a present to remember me by.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.542
It's a friendship bracelet.

16:59.584 --> 17:05.959
Diamonds? Awww. I really

16:59.584 --> 17:05.959
prefer coal, but thank you.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.083
Goodbye, Skylar.

17:12.334 --> 17:15.416
I hope you get your powers back.

17:15.459 --> 17:20.541
- Take care of her, Experion.

17:15.459 --> 17:20.541
- Oh, don't worry, I will.

17:20.584 --> 17:25.000
- Shouldn't you be signing out?

17:20.584 --> 17:25.000
- Oh... right.

17:27.541 --> 17:30.459
I can't believe Skylar's really

17:27.541 --> 17:30.459
going back to her planet.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.500
I can't believe you gave her

17:30.500 --> 17:33.500
diamonds instead of coal.

17:33.542 --> 17:35.542
You know nothing about women.

17:36.918 --> 17:39.334
Wait! She just said

17:36.918 --> 17:39.334
she preferred coal.

17:39.375 --> 17:44.459
But in Issue 35, she becomes

17:39.375 --> 17:44.459
incapacitated when exposed to

17:39.375 --> 17:44.459
coal while saving those miners!

17:44.500 --> 17:46.292
That's right! It's one

17:44.500 --> 17:46.292
of her weaknesses!

17:46.334 --> 17:48.626
She knew we'd know that,

17:46.334 --> 17:48.626
and she's trying to signal us!

17:48.667 --> 17:50.959
We've got to stop him!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
[alarm blaring]

18:09.959 --> 18:12.000
You think you can hide?

18:30.250 --> 18:33.500
Think! Experion has to have

18:30.250 --> 18:33.500
some weaknesses.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.459
He can't see in the dark.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.459
No one from Caldera can.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.000
Then Skylar

18:39.083 --> 18:41.000
won't be able to see either!

18:43.709 --> 18:46.459
Oh! There are night vision

18:43.709 --> 18:46.459
goggles in here somewhere.

19:01.751 --> 19:03.000
Skylar, catch!

19:03.834 --> 19:06.000
Kaz, hit the lights!

19:22.626 --> 19:24.000
Skylar, look out!

19:38.167 --> 19:41.042
So... can we still be friends?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.167
Sure!

19:43.417 --> 19:45.000
Oh, her.

19:48.209 --> 19:52.751
You saved my life.

19:48.209 --> 19:52.751
Thankfully, you got

19:48.209 --> 19:52.751
my signal about the coal.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.000
Guess you know me better

19:52.792 --> 19:56.000
than I knew Experion.

19:57.334 --> 20:01.042
Hey...that's what

19:57.334 --> 20:01.042
friends are for.

20:01.083 --> 20:04.042
And, I'm sorry you won't

20:01.083 --> 20:04.042
be getting your powers back,

20:04.083 --> 20:05.709
but I'm glad you're OK.

20:05.751 --> 20:07.584
Me, too.

20:07.626 --> 20:13.083
So, you want to hang out?

20:07.626 --> 20:13.083
Maybe we could go see a movie?

20:13.125 --> 20:15.292
Sounds great!

20:17.125 --> 20:19.709
Oh, her. Right.

20:25.667 --> 20:28.375
Hello, fine human shopkeepers.

20:28.417 --> 20:32.042
I've decided to give you one

20:28.417 --> 20:32.042
last human chance to buy my

20:28.417 --> 20:32.042
comic book

20:32.083 --> 20:35.250
- that takes place in...

20:32.083 --> 20:35.250
Mighty Med.

20:32.083 --> 20:35.250
- [paper shredder whirring]

20:38.792 --> 20:41.083
I'm sorry, what was that?

20:41.125 --> 20:42.667
Will you buy my comic book?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.751
And remember, I will not

20:42.709 --> 20:44.751
take "no" for an answer.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.792
- Will you take

20:44.792 --> 20:46.792
"non" for an answer?

20:44.792 --> 20:46.792
- Non.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.667
- Will you take

20:46.834 --> 20:49.667
"hayir" for an answer?

20:46.834 --> 20:49.667
- Hayir.

20:49.709 --> 20:51.292
- Hapana?

20:49.709 --> 20:51.292
- Hapana.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.000
- Nahim?

20:51.334 --> 20:54.000
- Nahim.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.876
Look, kid, we're sorry,

20:57.083 --> 21:00.876
but we already found

20:57.083 --> 21:00.876
the next big thing.

21:00.918 --> 21:04.209
We open on... a wall!

21:05.751 --> 21:07.500
But not just any wall.

21:07.542 --> 21:11.292
A wall with...

21:07.542 --> 21:11.292
an egg sitting on it!

21:12.751 --> 21:15.751
[both] Continue!

21:15.792 --> 21:21.042
What is this egg doing?

21:15.792 --> 21:21.042
Is this wall its home?

21:15.792 --> 21:21.042
Is he thinking of jumping?

21:21.083 --> 21:24.542
No! Don't jump, Mr. Egg!

21:21.083 --> 21:24.542
You've got so much to live for!

21:24.584 --> 21:26.083
No he doesn't, he's just an egg.

21:26.125 --> 21:28.626
- Well, I still care about him!

21:26.125 --> 21:28.626
- All right.
