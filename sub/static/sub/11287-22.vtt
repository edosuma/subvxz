WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:03.200
Okay, okay, here we are.

00:03.266 --> 00:05.866
At a demonstration in front
of the student union.

00:05.933 --> 00:09.033
That's me, there's Max,
and that's Shayla.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.833
Oh, that's Max's legendary
roommate, huh?

00:11.900 --> 00:13.266
She's pretty.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.433
Well, that's 'cause
she's standing next to Max.

00:18.633 --> 00:19.566
They're not here yet?

00:19.633 --> 00:20.566
Max, they weren't here

00:20.633 --> 00:21.900
two minutes ago
when you called

00:21.966 --> 00:24.133
from your stoopin',
they're not here now.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.000
Well, sorry. You know,
I just can't believe

00:26.066 --> 00:27.433
my girl's
getting married.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.866
You know, back at school,
she bet me

00:28.933 --> 00:30.700
I'd be the first
to jump the broom.

00:30.766 --> 00:33.166
So she drank pretty much
around the clock.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.400
Regine, why don't you
click your heels three times

00:37.466 --> 00:39.433
and go to hell?

00:43.900 --> 00:46.633
Kinda scared of the two of y'all
gettin' back together again.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.000
Even the wrestling team
was afraid of 'em.

00:49.066 --> 00:51.133
Ah, you put a little super glue
on a wrestling mat

00:51.200 --> 00:54.366
and everybody
starts screamin'.

00:54.433 --> 00:55.366
[knock on door]

00:55.433 --> 00:56.866
[cackles]

01:00.673 --> 01:02.606
Damn, you look like hell.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.306
I see you had them three sixes
removed from you forehead.

01:08.973 --> 01:11.173
[screaming]

01:14.106 --> 01:18.240
‐ Khadija. Ooh.
‐ Shayla. Oh.

01:18.306 --> 01:21.340
Them, this is Shayla.
Shayla, this is them.

01:21.406 --> 01:22.473
‐ Hey, girl.
‐ 'Hi.'

01:22.540 --> 01:25.640
Hey, you know I thought
your fiance was coming.

01:25.706 --> 01:29.240
Or did he get smart
and bail out over Lake Michigan?

01:29.306 --> 01:31.240
Chris is parking the car, and..

01:31.306 --> 01:33.406
Max, there's something
I should tell you.

01:33.473 --> 01:35.206
Something I should have
told you a long time ago.

01:35.273 --> 01:37.106
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37.173 --> 01:39.740
Did I used
to date this guy?

01:39.806 --> 01:40.840
Doubtful.

01:40.906 --> 01:43.673
Ugh, a parking space
opened up right out‐front.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.506
Hey, guys.

01:52.873 --> 01:55.573
Everybody, meet Chris.

02:00.313 --> 02:02.613
Hey, girl.

02:04.180 --> 02:07.180
Chris? As in fiance Chris?

02:07.713 --> 02:09.946
Yeah.

02:10.013 --> 02:13.013
Lesbians.
Neat, neat.

Max, I've heard

02:49.613 --> 02:51.713
I mean, I feel like
I know you.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.046
Funny, I had you pictured
a little differently.

02:55.113 --> 02:56.413
I thought you'd be a man.

02:59.080 --> 03:01.020
Well, if you heard
her Yaphet Kotto impression

03:01.086 --> 03:02.253
you'd swear she was.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.420
[laughs]

03:03.486 --> 03:06.520
Yaphet Kotto. Yaphet Kotto.
Yaphet Kotto.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.253
'That is funny.
That is a funny man.'

03:13.086 --> 03:15.686
Look, Max, I know
I dropped a bomb, but‐‐

03:15.753 --> 03:17.453
But‐but what, what, what?

03:17.520 --> 03:20.020
I mean, one minute I'm waiting
to check out Mr. Right

03:20.086 --> 03:22.553
and the next I'm wondering
how she handles PMS.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.020
You know, Max, I'm sorry.

03:27.086 --> 03:28.420
I mean, I tried to
tell you for years.

03:28.486 --> 03:30.886
But every time I called,
I just couldn't find the words.

03:30.953 --> 03:32.953
"I'm gay" is a real toll saver.

03:36.786 --> 03:40.186
Uh, so girls,
Peppermint Patty.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.053
Is she or isn't she?

03:46.586 --> 03:48.220
Max, maybe you should forget

03:48.286 --> 03:50.453
about throwing
this bridal shower for us.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.853
‐ I can't do that.
‐ Are you sure?

03:52.920 --> 03:55.453
Yeah, Synclaire's got
her heart set on this thing.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.820
She's even made roses
out of toilet paper.

04:00.260 --> 04:02.426
Max, are we cool?

04:02.493 --> 04:03.493
Yeah.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.493
We're cool.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.893
I just hope I can get back the
deposit on the male stripper.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.326
I‐I hate to do this,
but, um, we gotta go.

04:13.393 --> 04:15.626
We have to meet with
the caterer in a half hour.

04:15.693 --> 04:17.526
Yeah, the man's gettin'
carried away.

04:17.593 --> 04:19.993
He wants to do pate
in the shape of breasts.

04:21.959 --> 04:25.060
Max, are you gonna
walk us to the car?

04:25.126 --> 04:27.493
Yeah, I'm gonna
walk 'em to the car.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.126
If you looking for me,
I'll be at the car.

04:31.593 --> 04:33.526
Alright, let's go
to the car.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.926
Hey, Max.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.860
And who are these
two gorgeous women

04:45.926 --> 04:48.693
who obviously don't realize the
awful company they're keeping?

04:50.960 --> 04:52.493
Chris and Shayla
from Seattle.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.060
The grinning peacock is Kyle.

04:55.026 --> 04:55.960
It's nice to meet you.

04:56.026 --> 04:57.860
Oh, the pleasure is mine.

04:57.926 --> 04:59.860
‐ Hello.
‐ Hello.

04:59.926 --> 05:02.900
And should you require
a tour of our fair city

05:02.966 --> 05:05.033
I'm the ultimate guide
to Gotham.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.000
Great, you can show us
all the lesbian hangouts.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.566
You okay, shorty?

05:21.633 --> 05:22.933
Huh? Oh..

05:23.000 --> 05:23.933
[chuckles]

05:24.000 --> 05:27.066
Yeah, Max just
left the building

05:27.133 --> 05:30.066
with...two beautiful gay women.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.033
You soured that woman
on the whole male species.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.566
Overton, you may go now.

05:39.633 --> 05:41.400
Hey, hey,
you wanna come with me?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.966
Solly Suit World is having
their annual almost‐wool sale.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.266
Plus, they're haulin' out
the used sock bin.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.266
You match em,
you keep em.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.166
Overton, before I allow
this brownstone

05:53.233 --> 05:55.866
to be hit
by your fashion tsunami

05:55.933 --> 05:59.000
I'm going to do for you what
I have done for no one else.

05:59.066 --> 06:00.506
I'm going to hook you up

06:00.573 --> 06:04.773
with my own personal
tailor, Mr. Mfume.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.340
Mmm.

06:06.406 --> 06:08.340
Kyle, didn't you
read the lease?

06:08.406 --> 06:10.940
"Occupancy by more
than one clotheshorse

06:11.006 --> 06:13.406
is both unlawful
and dangerous."

06:14.740 --> 06:18.306
Would it change your mind
if I told you that Mr. Mfume

06:18.373 --> 06:21.106
dresses some
of television's top stars?

06:21.173 --> 06:24.140
What, that supposed
to impress me?

06:24.206 --> 06:26.073
Including Bob Vila.

06:29.406 --> 06:31.906
Well, I suppose looking
at a few fabric swatches

06:31.973 --> 06:33.606
couldn't hurt nobody.

06:35.940 --> 06:38.373
I am blown away.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.706
By what?

06:39.773 --> 06:41.973
Look, if Shayla didn't feel
close enough

06:42.040 --> 06:43.673
to share something
this important until now

06:43.740 --> 06:45.073
what does it say
about our friendship?

06:45.140 --> 06:46.206
I mean, come on!

06:46.273 --> 06:48.140
Aren't you a little upset,
finding out like this?

06:49.440 --> 06:50.373
Oh, yeah.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.840
Yeah, I'm upset.

06:52.906 --> 06:54.340
I'm damn upset.

06:56.173 --> 06:57.873
Hold up!

06:57.940 --> 06:59.973
When did she tell you?

07:00.040 --> 07:02.380
Just a little bit
before you, that's all.

07:02.446 --> 07:03.813
How much before?

07:06.646 --> 07:08.413
Junior year.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.280
No! Dong‐a‐dee,
dong, dong, dong!

07:11.346 --> 07:12.313
I mean, shoot!

07:12.380 --> 07:14.746
I mean, gosh.
I mean, does everybody know?

07:14.813 --> 07:16.813
What is it,
the joke's on me?

07:16.880 --> 07:20.213
Max, she just wanted
to tell you in her own time.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.013
When would that be? After
the second turkey‐baster baby?

07:25.513 --> 07:28.113
Max, I don't know
why she waited all this time.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.746
But she told you.

07:29.813 --> 07:31.446
Now, deal with it.

07:31.513 --> 07:34.313
But I told her every
grisly detail of my life.

07:35.613 --> 07:37.613
Including that little romp
in the cafeteria

07:37.680 --> 07:39.613
with Benny, the plate‐scraper.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.913
You never told me about that.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.246
See how it feels?

07:47.380 --> 07:48.546
[humming]

07:51.213 --> 07:53.880
Nah! Nah, kid. nah.

07:55.346 --> 07:57.246
Come on, now. We're gonna
have to lose the sign.

07:57.313 --> 08:00.886
Tsk. Alright, alright,
I'll admit it.

08:00.953 --> 08:02.853
I'm not up
on lesbian etiquette.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.753
It's not like I've ever
known any before.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.186
Mm‐hmm.
Aunt Gladys was gay.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.486
Aunt Gladys was not gay.

08:09.553 --> 08:11.486
She just never found
the right man.

08:12.953 --> 08:14.553
Like her roommate, Aunt Hazel.

08:16.386 --> 08:17.920
[doorbell rings]

08:17.986 --> 08:19.353
I'll get it.

08:23.986 --> 08:26.686
Welcome to the shower.
Drinks are on the table.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.986
Pu‐pu platter?

08:30.053 --> 08:31.820
Pu‐pu for you.

08:33.352 --> 08:35.285
What the hell is this?

08:36.419 --> 08:38.620
I'm thinking of our guests.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.753
You know I'm cute.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.220
Hey, you know how enticing
I usually look.

08:43.285 --> 08:45.620
Why put out the banquet

08:45.686 --> 08:47.620
if they can't eat?

08:51.620 --> 08:52.653
Well, you succeeded.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.520
You definitely look
like a sack lunch.

08:55.586 --> 08:56.853
[knock on door]

09:00.020 --> 09:02.593
Hey, come on in.
Hi. Thanks.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.093
‐ 'What's up, girl? Welcome.'
‐ Hi.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.093
‐ 'Welcome.'
‐ Hi.

09:11.526 --> 09:12.793
(Kyle)
'Hey, there.'

09:12.860 --> 09:15.160
You know, I could change the way
you look at the world.

09:15.226 --> 09:16.360
[snarls]

09:18.993 --> 09:21.493
Eh, you're just like
the rest of them.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.860
Afraid of men.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.626
Yeah, but that's, uh,
that's Khadija's friend, Jamie.

09:26.693 --> 09:27.726
She's straight.

09:28.793 --> 09:30.760
So she says.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.993
Oh, Overton!

09:39.060 --> 09:41.060
You look
good enough to bury.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.493
Well, thank you,
my little pallbearer.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.360
But, uh, I owe it all to Kyle

09:48.426 --> 09:50.960
and his tailor extraordinaire,
Mr. Mfume.

09:51.026 --> 09:53.160
Good looking out.

09:55.126 --> 09:57.326
Wh‐wh‐what
the hell is this?

09:57.393 --> 09:59.160
I mean, you have stolen
my whole look.

09:59.226 --> 10:00.433
Everything
from the button pattern

10:00.500 --> 10:01.566
to the cut of the pleats.

10:01.633 --> 10:04.133
These are original touches
that I created

10:04.200 --> 10:05.700
with Mr. Mfume.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.333
And‐and wh‐wh‐what,
what's that?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.866
Um, wild guess,
uh, lapels.

10:10.933 --> 10:12.433
No.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.600
Those are Barker lapels.

10:14.666 --> 10:16.500
And they are gracing the suit
of a man who believes

10:16.566 --> 10:18.533
"Do not bleach"
is a designer label.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.300
Man, get up off
your high horse.

10:21.366 --> 10:23.566
Mr. Mfume said
I was a tailor's dream

10:23.633 --> 10:25.933
whereas you have some sort
of turkey neck thing working

10:26.000 --> 10:28.066
that makes fitting you
a challenge.

10:29.233 --> 10:32.600
Well, excuse me for having
a bold Adam's apple.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.466
Kyle, just get
over yourself, man.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.600
Oh, I know these lover's
quarrels can be rough.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.433
But if it's any consolation,
think how passionate

10:41.500 --> 10:43.433
it's gonna be
when you make up.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.700
Oh, no, no, no, no, that..

10:49.766 --> 10:51.466
Mm. Now, that ain't
no lover's quarrel.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.366
See, he's just mad 'cause he
thinks I'm wearing his clothes.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.533
Damn!

10:59.600 --> 11:00.640
Did I miss anything?

11:00.706 --> 11:02.006
Not that anyone would tell me.

11:04.806 --> 11:07.106
[gasps]
Everybody,
it's the happy couple!

11:07.173 --> 11:09.906
Congratulations!

11:09.973 --> 11:12.040
Thanks, y'all.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.106
Well, Max, I owe you five
dollars, remember?

11:15.173 --> 11:18.473
I bet you that you'd be
the first to take the plunge.

11:18.540 --> 11:21.006
Why don't you keep it?
You hold on to things so well.

11:24.806 --> 11:26.406
Regine.

11:26.473 --> 11:28.740
This is a different look
for you.

11:28.806 --> 11:30.306
It's very cute.

11:36.306 --> 11:37.706
Well, damn, I can't win.

11:38.873 --> 11:40.806
Alright, everybody,
this concludes

11:40.873 --> 11:42.606
the small‐talk portion
of this afternoon.

11:42.673 --> 11:46.306
It's time to meet
the merchandise.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.006
This one's from Regine.

11:50.073 --> 11:51.840
‐ Open and enjoy.
‐ Thank you.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.406
Oh, wow!

11:54.473 --> 11:56.240
A double makeup mirror.

11:56.306 --> 11:57.873
Where did you find this?

11:57.940 --> 11:59.913
In the prop department
of my soap.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.646
I work on "Palo Alto."

12:01.713 --> 12:04.646
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Yes..

12:04.713 --> 12:06.946
Well, you guys remember,
they used that in the storyline

12:07.013 --> 12:08.946
with the Siamese twins
who were beauty queens?

12:09.013 --> 12:11.580
Miss North and South Dakota?

12:11.646 --> 12:14.380
Here. Pass this down.
This one's from Max.

12:27.446 --> 12:30.480
I bought that last week before
I found out what everybody else

12:30.546 --> 12:33.080
has apparently known
since the Ice Age.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.380
Max, kitchen.

12:36.446 --> 12:38.246
Sure. After you.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.613
Suddenly, I'm feeling pretty
good about my rice cooker.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.846
What the hell was that?

12:48.913 --> 12:50.746
How could you tell Khadija
and not me?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.813
Trust me, Max,
I had my reasons.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.346
Like what?

12:54.413 --> 12:56.213
Look, I don't have
to tell you.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.213
Why, you‐you, you didn't think
I could handle having

12:58.280 --> 12:59.880
a roommate that was gay?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.853
No, I didn't think you could
handle having a roommate

13:01.920 --> 13:03.853
who was in love with you.

13:18.253 --> 13:20.620
Now, uh..
Now, wait a minute. Now..

13:20.686 --> 13:22.420
You.. You, you were what?

13:22.486 --> 13:24.886
You, you felt what?
You, you said what?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.786
See? I knew
you couldn't handle it.

13:29.853 --> 13:31.920
But, I'm, I'm handling.

13:31.986 --> 13:34.220
What? Wait.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.520
Uh..

13:36.586 --> 13:38.520
How long
have you been in, uh..

13:41.053 --> 13:43.553
You know,
felt that way about me?

13:45.320 --> 13:48.253
[sighs]
When we first met in the dorm
and you introduced yourself

13:48.320 --> 13:49.886
as Max, the maverick

13:49.953 --> 13:51.220
I didn't know
what to make of you.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.286
Then, before I knew it,
we were best friends.

13:56.386 --> 13:58.453
Then I realized
I was in trouble.

14:00.526 --> 14:02.460
There's got to be
a beer in here somewhere.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.793
I mean there I was,
in the back seat

14:05.860 --> 14:07.226
of Dexter Finley's
Firebird

14:07.293 --> 14:09.326
wondering what kind
of person has sex

14:09.393 --> 14:11.626
with sunglasses on?

14:11.693 --> 14:13.726
And I realized
I'd rather be with you.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.526
But you knew
I was straight, right?

14:18.893 --> 14:20.760
Well, I did wonder..

14:20.826 --> 14:21.960
Every time
you'd rant about

14:22.026 --> 14:25.260
how men were like snorting
warthogs without charm.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.860
It was those volleyball shorts
I used to wear, wasn't it?

14:37.993 --> 14:39.760
It was a lot of things, Max.

14:39.826 --> 14:42.093
I mean, you're
an incredible woman.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.593
And for years, I kept comparing
you to everybody I met.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.293
And then
when Chris came along

14:48.360 --> 14:50.526
I realized
I'd stopped comparing.

14:50.593 --> 14:52.393
And I realized
she was the one.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.493
Well, I'm very glad

14:56.560 --> 14:58.493
you found someone
you can be yourself around.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.000
Of course, I am assuming
she knows you're gay.

15:03.633 --> 15:06.233
I'm sure it'll be
a beautiful ceremony.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.266
Wait. You're gonna
be there, right?

15:09.333 --> 15:12.700
Well, gee, I don't know, Shay.
I mean, what would people think?

15:12.766 --> 15:15.033
Everyone whispering
about the other woman.

15:18.666 --> 15:20.633
Fine, Max.
Don't come.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.866
The reception hall
doesn't allow children anyway.

15:28.766 --> 15:30.700
And by the way,
those volleyball shorts?

15:30.766 --> 15:31.933
They weren't all that.

15:37.533 --> 15:40.466
Well, you will not believe what
Shayla told me in the kitchen.

15:40.533 --> 15:41.666
Oh, Lord.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.133
Not more whining
about the college roommate.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.000
It seems in college,
she was madly in love with me.

15:48.066 --> 15:50.000
[clattering]
No, girl.
When did this happen?

15:50.066 --> 15:51.766
[clamoring]

15:51.833 --> 15:53.433
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.433
What the hell does
she see in you?

15:58.466 --> 15:59.640
Why did she tell you now?

15:59.706 --> 16:01.240
I, I forced it out of her.

16:01.306 --> 16:04.540
Oh, my goodness. She had
a forbidden love for you.

16:04.606 --> 16:07.506
It's like that paperback I once
found on my father's nightstand.

16:07.573 --> 16:09.140
"Secret Sorority."

16:11.573 --> 16:15.040
You know, all through college,
I went through men like water.

16:15.106 --> 16:17.806
I mean, what does that say about
me that my closest relationship

16:17.873 --> 16:19.240
was with a gay woman?

16:19.306 --> 16:20.873
Well, Max, you know,
I don't claim

16:20.940 --> 16:22.706
to know everything
about homosexuality.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.406
Yeah, well, that would be
a big relief

16:24.473 --> 16:26.406
to the gay community.

16:29.206 --> 16:32.106
It seems to me that
if someone gets to know you

16:32.173 --> 16:33.673
warts and all

16:33.740 --> 16:36.006
and still cares
about you very deeply

16:36.073 --> 16:38.340
that's the best kind
of friend, isn't it?

16:40.106 --> 16:41.673
Synclaire, it's time
for you and lamb chop

16:41.740 --> 16:43.673
to sing
a little night‐night song.

16:45.073 --> 16:47.406
Max, let me ask you something.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.173
The entire time
y'all roomed together

16:49.240 --> 16:50.473
did she ever try
and come on to you?

16:52.306 --> 16:55.440
‐ No.
‐ Okay, so she played it cool.

16:55.506 --> 16:57.373
That's how much your friendship
mattered to her.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.646
Don't make me go back
and rethink this.

17:01.713 --> 17:02.780
I've already come up
with a bitterness

17:02.846 --> 17:04.780
I feel very comfortable with.

17:06.213 --> 17:09.246
Girl, the seafood at this
restaurant is so fresh

17:09.313 --> 17:11.280
they bring the fish
to your table

17:11.346 --> 17:13.113
behead it, scale it,
gut it, bone it

17:13.180 --> 17:15.413
fry it up
right before your eyes.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.780
Now the chicken dishes,
they get a little messy.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.946
I hope you are happy.

17:30.013 --> 17:32.946
Thanks to yours
and Mr. Mfume's betrayal

17:33.013 --> 17:35.613
I threw myself onto
the needles of another tailor

17:35.680 --> 17:38.613
and what you see
is the wretched result.

17:41.413 --> 17:43.046
It matches and it fits.

17:43.113 --> 17:45.146
I can see
why you are perturbed.

17:46.613 --> 17:48.513
Please, the, the jacket
has a back bubble.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.646
See the way it bunches up
like neck‐fat?

17:51.813 --> 17:55.646
And a good pleat
should gallop down the thigh.

17:55.713 --> 17:59.080
Not stagger out
of the gate and collapse.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.586
Are we still talking
about clothing?

18:01.653 --> 18:03.653
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold on, shorty. Um..

18:03.720 --> 18:06.186
Got a little something
that might lift your spirits.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.886
Uh, Mr. Mfume thought
that business card would be

18:09.953 --> 18:12.653
a excellent way
to expand his clientele.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.586
Uh, with your permission.

18:14.653 --> 18:18.653
Suits by Mfume
featuring the Barker lapel.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.053
‐ Ooh‐hoo.
‐ See now, Kyle.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.020
You're gonna be
as famous as Bobby Jacobs

18:23.086 --> 18:25.020
and his Ruffle shirt.

18:25.953 --> 18:28.220
Okay, more famous.

18:28.286 --> 18:30.186
I must go upstairs
and call Mr. Mfume.

18:30.253 --> 18:32.453
I mean, you cannot market
the Barker lapel

18:32.520 --> 18:34.853
without marketing
the Barker waistband pocket.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.453
Oh, and people are going
to clamor for the Kyle cuff.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.886
[guffaws]

18:40.786 --> 18:42.820
How'd you get those cards
printed up so fast?

18:42.886 --> 18:44.620
Oh, they're quick down
at Mort's Print

18:44.686 --> 18:46.153
while you bowl.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.986
By the time they sprayed
my rental shoes

18:48.053 --> 18:49.620
the cards were ready.

18:49.686 --> 18:51.753
‐ Come on, mama.
‐ Let's go, daddy.

18:54.886 --> 18:57.053
(Max)
Hi, Shay.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.460
Max, taking your little
humiliation tour on the road?

19:00.526 --> 19:02.060
Alright, look,
we gotta talk.

19:02.126 --> 19:03.926
Can you wait until
I'm back under the dryer?

19:03.993 --> 19:06.826
Ladies, I can't create
with this is kind of tension.

19:07.893 --> 19:09.826
I'll go fluff
the other bride.

19:11.726 --> 19:15.526
Look, come on, this whole thing
just took me by surprise.

19:15.593 --> 19:17.393
Max, you can't
have it both ways.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.360
You can't be mad at me
for not telling you

19:19.426 --> 19:20.860
and then mad at me
because I did.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.226
Well, how'd you
expect me to react

19:22.293 --> 19:24.126
when you told me
how you felt?

19:24.193 --> 19:26.726
How do you think I felt when
I told you and you looked at me

19:26.793 --> 19:29.126
like I said I was sleeping
with Rush Limbaugh?

19:30.693 --> 19:31.760
That's just sick.

19:31.826 --> 19:33.926
I mean this is just gonna
take me a little time.

19:33.993 --> 19:36.693
I mean, you basically told me
that our whole friendship

19:36.760 --> 19:38.926
was one big lie.

19:38.993 --> 19:40.560
Max, let's lose
the drama, alright?

19:40.626 --> 19:43.526
I admit it. I kept one secret
from you, but that's it.

19:43.593 --> 19:46.360
That's it? Well, think
of all the time we wasted.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.060
All the conversations
we didn't have.

19:48.126 --> 19:51.526
All those chances I would have
had to diss your dates.

19:51.593 --> 19:52.593
I can imagine
some of the heifers

19:52.660 --> 19:53.793
you must've gone out with.

19:55.426 --> 19:58.460
Only one heifer. And she didn't
start out that way.

19:58.526 --> 20:00.200
She just had this thing
for comfort food.

20:02.433 --> 20:03.800
Well, see?

20:03.866 --> 20:05.800
See, we could have
talked about that.

20:06.766 --> 20:07.700
[sighing]

20:08.866 --> 20:09.833
Girl, look..

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
Maybe if you would
have confessed

20:14.366 --> 20:16.133
all this back in, in school

20:16.200 --> 20:18.300
maybe I would have freaked.

20:18.366 --> 20:21.600
But the point is, I wish you
would have given me the chance

20:21.666 --> 20:23.600
to rise to the occasion.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.566
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.000
If we'd talked
about it back then

20:32.066 --> 20:33.500
maybe I wouldn't have
gotten such a crappy

20:33.566 --> 20:35.200
shower gift from you.

20:38.766 --> 20:40.133
By the way, is there
a reason why your dreads

20:40.200 --> 20:42.333
are so fuzzy in the front?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.433
Fuzzy?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.133
There. You always
were an easy mark.

20:48.466 --> 20:50.800
You always were
a pain in the ass.

20:50.866 --> 20:52.733
[chuckles]

20:52.800 --> 20:54.266
I knew it!

20:54.333 --> 20:56.900
You haven't gotten her
out of your system.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.533
‐ We're through.
‐ Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.706
You know I don't like her
like that. Now, come here.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.240
Now, who were you
callin' an easy mark?

21:09.006 --> 21:11.706
Yeah. I don't know
what you see in her.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.673
‐ Max.
‐ Oh, thank you.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.106
All this love.
