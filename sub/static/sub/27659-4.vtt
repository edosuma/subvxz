WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:06.136
- All right, Jeffords,
what's this meeting all about?

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
I've got a full workload today.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.791
- I didn't call it.
I thought you did.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.053
- What? I did no such thing.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.054
- So if neither of you
called it,

00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
then who did?

00:12.403 --> 00:14.057
- Gina. Right.
- That makes sense.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.363
- Oh!

00:19.454 --> 00:21.630
Oh, Sheila,
that was awesome.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.023
Okay, just stay here.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.111
Wow, can't believe

00:24.154 --> 00:25.851
I executed that to perfection.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.593
- That was amazing.
- Gina, what's this all about?

00:28.637 --> 00:30.726
- I wanted to make one final
grand entrance.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.075
- Final? What do you mean?

00:32.119 --> 00:34.077
- I've decided
to leave the Nine-Nine.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.252
Which is why...

00:37.950 --> 00:39.517
- Oh, okay.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.046
- I'm handing in my two weeks'
notice.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.396
- I don't understand.
What are you gonna do?

00:48.439 --> 00:49.701
- I'm not sure,
but Jake convinced me

00:49.745 --> 00:51.573
it was time to start
a new chapter.

00:51.616 --> 00:55.533
It was time to
spread my wings and fly.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.058
I'm an angel.
I'm an angel.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.103
I'm an angel.
- This is crazy.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.800
I can't imagine
the Nine-Nine without you.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.759
- Don't worry. I have
a parting gift for all of you.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.370
I printed "Time for Gina's
Opinion" hoodies

01:06.414 --> 01:08.024
for you
with your names on them.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.070
Oh, there you go.
- Oh, that's fun.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.419
So like
"Time for Jake's Opinion"?

01:11.462 --> 01:12.681
- What are you, insane? No.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.378
It says
"Time for Gina's Opinion"

01:14.422 --> 01:16.076
in large text on the back

01:16.119 --> 01:17.468
and then your names
are stitched

01:17.512 --> 01:19.079
really tiny on the front.
- Ah.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.993
- I had to guess
at some of the spellings.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.560
- Arnie?
- But that's not all.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.388
Over the next two weeks,
I will be leaving

01:24.432 --> 01:26.956
each of you with
a signature Gina Moment,

01:26.999 --> 01:29.567
something so shocking
that it will stay with you

01:29.611 --> 01:31.308
for the rest of your lives,

01:31.352 --> 01:34.094
much like this interpretive
dance piece,

01:34.137 --> 01:36.487
entitled, "The Linexit."

01:37.271 --> 01:39.751
This dance will be performed
in four movements,

01:39.795 --> 01:43.190
each one expressing one aspect
of my personality.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.733
- Oh.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.433
Awesome.
Was that the first movement?

02:09.477 --> 02:11.609
- What? Are you crazy?
No. That's the warm-up.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.221
Each movement is 45 minutes.
- Oh, damn.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.352
- Hit it!

02:36.852 --> 02:39.985
- Hey, Craptain,
you ready to get curb stomped?

02:40.029 --> 02:41.161
- What?
- At chess.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.205
- We have a weekly match.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.467
I'm teaching Gina to play.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.816
And she, in turn,
is teaching me

02:44.860 --> 02:47.210
to trash talk.
The hospital called.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.951
Your test results came back
positive.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.953
You're a stage five
dumbass.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.433
- Oh!
You have come so far.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.651
- You any good, Gina?
- The best.

02:53.695 --> 02:54.870
- She struggles.
We've been playing

02:54.913 --> 02:56.001
for four years now

02:56.045 --> 02:57.438
and she has yet to defeat me.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.048
- Well, good luck.
I'm rooting for you, Gina.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.223
- You would take
the losers side,

03:00.267 --> 03:02.356
Jeffords, you bitch.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.661
Trash talk.
- Okay.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.010
I don't like this.
I'm gonna go.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.317
- Really good, sir.
Really good.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.928
- I don't know why
you're so confident you'll win.

03:09.972 --> 03:13.018
You still don't even know
the names of all the pieces.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.542
You dumbass.
- Nice.

03:14.585 --> 03:17.414
But I do know the names.
I've simply rebranded them.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.982
My queen is Rihanna.
My king is BeyoncÃ©.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.593
And this little guy is Kevin.

03:22.637 --> 03:25.596
Would you be willing to murder
Kevin, the love of your life?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.511
- Yes. Chess Kevin means
nothing to me.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.121
Gina, have you
thought this through?

03:29.165 --> 03:30.340
Have you considered

03:30.384 --> 03:31.820
the ramifications
of what you're doing?

03:31.863 --> 03:34.039
- Yeah, I mean,
I named this guy Hitchcock

03:34.083 --> 03:35.389
and now I kind of
want him off the board.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.868
- I was talking about
your decision

03:36.912 --> 03:38.130
to leave the Nine-Nine.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.741
Although I understand
your confusion.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.960
There are many parallels
between the game of chess

03:42.004 --> 03:43.745
and the game of life.
- Not really.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.269
They're just a bunch of pieces
of wood on a placemat.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.924
- In chess,
every move has consequences,

03:48.967 --> 03:51.796
some of which won't reveal
themselves until too late.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.799
Even a small, seemingly
insignificant decision

03:54.843 --> 03:57.062
can change the course
of the entire game.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.500
- I feel like you're worried
I haven't considered

03:59.543 --> 04:02.154
the consequences of quitting,
but I have.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.156
- I know you feel you could be
doing more with your life,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.637
but you're leaving the
Nine-Nine without a clear plan.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.248
It's reckless.
- What you don't get,

04:08.291 --> 04:11.555
but the greats do is that
in order to be successful,

04:11.599 --> 04:13.862
sometimes you gotta
be reckless.

04:13.905 --> 04:14.993
Boom.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.560
- Checkmate.
- All right, all right.

04:16.604 --> 04:17.909
I see you.
- It was a good game though

04:17.953 --> 04:19.302
for a dumbass.
- Okay, you're kinda

04:19.346 --> 04:20.564
overusing that one.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.044
Maybe switch it up
a little bit.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.698
- Oh, good note.
You dick.

04:23.741 --> 04:27.092
- That landed good. All right,
re-rack. Let's play again.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.269
Mkay, my move?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.444
- Ah, whites go first.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.880
- Oh, chess
really is like life.

04:31.923 --> 04:32.750
Commentary.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.578
The game you love is racist

04:34.622 --> 04:36.493
and you're complicit.
- So what's your plan?

04:36.537 --> 04:38.669
Not with chess,
with your life moving forward.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.541
- I mean, I could do basically
anything.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.283
I could come up with a new form
of cryptocurrency

04:43.326 --> 04:45.067
called GinaCoin,
make millions.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.288
Could write a YA novel
about literally anything,

04:48.331 --> 04:49.463
I think, and make millions.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.291
I could discover a new type

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
of melon, make millions.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.946
- I'm not saying your dreams
are unattainable.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.818
But you can pursue them
while you're still

04:56.861 --> 04:58.341
gainfully employed
here at the Nine-Nine.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.821
What's the rush
to turn your back

04:59.864 --> 05:01.475
on stability and a paycheck?

05:01.518 --> 05:03.172
I don't want stability
and a paycheck.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.347
I wanna take a risk.

05:04.391 --> 05:07.350
Quote: "A bird can never
learn to fly

05:07.394 --> 05:09.309
if it doesn't leave
the nest."

05:09.352 --> 05:11.441
End quote.
Gina Linetti, right now.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.617
- Quote, "The bird
that leaves the nest too soon

05:13.661 --> 05:16.098
plummets to its death
on the concrete below."

05:16.141 --> 05:18.753
Captain Raymond Holt,
immediately afterwards.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.450
- Nothing bad
ever happens to me.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.409
I have a crystal in my pocket
at all times.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.324
- What about when you got hit
by that bus?

05:24.367 --> 05:26.326
- That bus was going
60 miles per hour

05:26.369 --> 05:29.329
and here I sit before you
completely fine.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.287
And you wanna say
crystals don't work?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.767
- Gina, I'm serious.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.378
What if you get sick?
Healthcare is expensive.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.380
What if something happens
to your daughter?

05:39.469 --> 05:40.818
- Checkmate.
- Did you just delay

05:40.862 --> 05:42.342
that victory by a few moves

05:42.385 --> 05:43.604
to punctuate your point?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.519
- I did.
- Barf. Rack 'em.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.825
- Okay, Captain,
you made some good points.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.436
I mean,
I get what you're saying

05:49.479 --> 05:51.786
about the healthcare
situation.

05:51.829 --> 05:52.874
- Checkmate.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.399
- I believe
that you're smart enough

05:56.443 --> 05:59.402
and talented enough
to do anything you want.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.665
but you have to have a plan.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.493
- Mm.
Interesting.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.016
Let me ask you something, sir.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.671
Did you always have a plan
for everything you ever did?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.369
You always thought out
every choice you ever made?

06:09.412 --> 06:10.544
- Yes.
By the time I was ten,

06:10.587 --> 06:11.936
I had mapped out
my entire life.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.677
I knew I wanted
to go to the Academy.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.113
I knew I wanted
to become a detective.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.593
- And you did it.
- Then move on to sergeant.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.029
- And you got it.
- Next, lieutenant.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.031
- Nailed it.
- And then, finally, captain.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.424
- Wow.
I'm convinced.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.818
I think I should reconsider
my decision.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.210
- Uh, we're not done
with the game.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.690
- I know.
I just wanted to stand

06:26.734 --> 06:29.563
so I could turn slowly
and say...

06:30.651 --> 06:32.435
But wasn't there another step

06:32.479 --> 06:33.915
in the Holt life plan?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.873
Gosh, what was it?
What came after captain?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.659
I can't seem to remember
for dramatic effect.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.356
- I wanted to be commissioner.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.054
-  Gina Moment.
- I get your point.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.492
Even the best laid plans
sometimes don't work out.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.058
- They sure don't.
And now it's time

06:47.102 --> 06:48.495
for Gina's closing thoughts.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.410
Just because
you wanna do something

06:50.453 --> 06:51.933
doesn't mean
you get to do it.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.676
Life is chaos, success is
completely arbitrary,

06:55.719 --> 06:58.026
and confidence is everything.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.855
- I was just worried.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.554
But I guess after working
with you for five years,

07:04.598 --> 07:06.208
I should've realized...

07:07.165 --> 07:09.646
You know what you're doing.
- Thanks, Captain.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.128
- Have you
thought this through?

07:13.171 --> 07:15.652
- Not at all. And yet...

07:15.696 --> 07:17.132
Checkmate.
- That was completely illegal.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.568
That's not at all
how the queen moves.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.440
- That's how this queen moves.
Checkmate.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.745
- It's against
the rules of chess.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.878
- Well, Gina Linetti done
reinvented the game.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.923
- Uh, I'm supporting
your overall career decision,

07:25.967 --> 07:27.490
I'm on board,
but you can't assign--

07:27.534 --> 07:29.579
I won both things.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.451
Chess and the argument.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.236
This little birdie,
she gotta fly the coop.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.195
I'm taking this with me
as a little remembrance, Sir.

07:37.239 --> 07:40.460
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!

07:43.463 --> 07:44.942
- Hey.
What are you two up to?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.378
- Eh, I'm on my phone

07:46.422 --> 07:48.424
and Rosa's just
sitting there silently.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.513
The yewzh.
- Well, I was thinking

07:50.557 --> 07:52.515
we could have
a ladies lunch today.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.952
- Amy, I wish I could
do lunch today,

07:54.996 --> 07:56.563
but I'm currently out of town.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.827
- Oh, come on. I wanna hang out
one last time before you--

07:59.870 --> 08:01.263
before you leave us.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.960
You're really special, Gina,

08:03.004 --> 08:04.396
and even though--

08:04.440 --> 08:06.790
I'm sorry.
I just get so emotional

08:06.834 --> 08:08.444
about these things,
you know?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.924
I wish I could be
more like Rosa.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.447
- Huh? I got bored.
What's going on?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.101
- See? She doesn't
even give a damn.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.755
I wish I could do that.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.321
Then I would cry less
at the bank.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.801
It's just
there's this one poster

08:17.845 --> 08:21.022
of this older Asian man
opening up a savings account

08:21.065 --> 08:22.893
for his grandson.
- Okay.

08:22.937 --> 08:24.547
All right, here's what's
gonna happen.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.463
Amy Santiago,
as my parting gift to you,

08:27.507 --> 08:29.117
before I leave your life
forever--

08:29.160 --> 08:30.771
- We'll still see each other
outside of work.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.555
- Before I leave your life
forever, I'm gonna fix you.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.296
I'm gonna teach you
how to be more cool

08:34.339 --> 08:36.864
and detached like me and Rosa.
- What's going on?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.779
- But we could still
go to lunch, right?

08:38.822 --> 08:41.172
I mean--
or not.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.696
Whatevs.
- Decent start.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.785
Yeah, sure, I mean,
we'll go to lunch with you.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.874
Why not?
- Okay, okay, cool.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.746
Just before we go, I'm gonna go
to go the bathroom for a bit.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.139
Not to cry about you leaving.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.620
But just to take a huge dump.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.797
So if you hear any crying
from the bathroom...

08:56.840 --> 08:59.103
Not about you.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.627
It's the dump.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.932
Okay?

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
- Gina,
since you're leaving,

09:03.630 --> 09:05.196
I'd like to make a toast.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.850
Bye.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.156
- Oh, my God.
That was perfect.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.505
- Mm.
- So nice.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.506
Gina, I got a little

09:10.550 --> 09:12.290
going away
present for you.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.815
Don't worry.
It's nothing big.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.165
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.645
- You once said
if you ever die,

09:18.688 --> 09:21.169
you wanted someone to turn
your tweets into a book,

09:21.212 --> 09:23.084
so that's what I did.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.913
- Oh, my God. I said
so many witty things so fast.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.349
- Yeah.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.568
- Amy, I don't know
what to say.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.439
This is horrifying.
- What?

09:30.482 --> 09:32.006
- This is way worse
than crying.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.660
I mean, you put so much work
into this.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.532
I'm completely uncomfortable.
It makes me...

09:36.576 --> 09:37.881
Kinda makes me sick.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.580
Amy, there's something
I want you to do right now.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.278
- Burn the book I made you?
- Yes.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.628
It's the only way to cleanse
your childish sentimentality

09:45.672 --> 09:48.675
and become the true you,
the one that's really Rosa.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.720
- Okay.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.852
Sure.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.157
I mean, it does include

09:53.201 --> 09:55.029
a very personal forward
I wrote

09:55.072 --> 09:57.858
and $75 of my best
archival glue,

09:57.901 --> 09:59.947
but...yeah, this feels good.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.863
- Hey. Never seen you burning
stuff at the bum barrel before.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.386
Right on.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.301
- What was in there, Hitchcock?
- Eh, eh, eh.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.781
First rule of the bum barrel:

10:07.824 --> 10:09.870
never ask somebody
what they're burning.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.828
- Well, okay then.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.134
All right Amy, it's time.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.223
Put the book in the barrel.
Let's go.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.400
- No! I can't do it.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.532
- What? I thought you wanted us
to change you.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.578
- I thought I did too,
but I don't.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.364
I like having emotions, okay?
This is who I am.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.671
You're leaving
and that's a really big change

10:28.715 --> 10:31.674
and I'm gonna cry about it
a lot, okay?

10:31.718 --> 10:32.893
- And there it is.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.721
Another flawless
Gina Moment.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.070
- What? What's going on?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.985
- Amy, the lesson I wanted
to leave you with

10:38.028 --> 10:39.943
is to just be yourself.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.858
If you want to cry
like an idiot

10:41.902 --> 10:43.599
for hours on end,
just do it.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.122
You wanna make
a big old ugly book

10:45.166 --> 10:47.734
full of all my brilliant
thoughts, do it.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.126
Do you!

10:50.780 --> 10:52.216
-  Thanks, Gina.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.569
-  Oh, wow.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.136
That was really, really sweet.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.400
- Oh, dip! I got Rosa
to feel her feelings too?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.751
Inadvertent Gina Moment.
Two for one.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.796
- Come in, my babies.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.276
Come in.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.625
- Sorry to interrupt,
ladies, but you might

11:09.669 --> 11:11.061
want to take
a couple of steps back.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.063
This is not
going to smell good.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.412
- Un-hug! Un-hug!
- Ugh!

11:16.980 --> 11:18.895
- Hey, does anyone have
a contact at Ellis Island?

11:18.939 --> 11:19.896
- Ellis Island?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.071
What's going on?

11:21.115 --> 11:22.333
- I'm trying to secure
a cool venue

11:22.377 --> 11:23.813
for Gina's going away party,
Gina-rama.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.597
- Oh, that invitation said
"Geena-rama"

11:25.641 --> 11:27.251
not "Gyna-rama."

11:27.295 --> 11:28.949
I thought it was weird they'd
move Gyna-rama from Tampa.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.428
It's really
a warm weather event.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.779
- Wait, I'm confused.
Did the Met fall through?

11:32.822 --> 11:34.737
- That place is stuffy
and lame.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.304
And also, it's $12 million.

11:36.347 --> 11:39.220
But the point is, I decided.
It was my call.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.570
- Just have it at Shaw's.
It doesn't have to be splashy.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.963
- It's a party for Gina.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.616
It absolutely has to be
splashy, Terrence.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.792
- Terrence, would you jump into

11:45.835 --> 11:47.097
a pool without water?

11:47.141 --> 11:48.838
No, the splash
is what keeps you alive.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.840
Splash is life.
- I know what you need.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.929
An insane devil stick
performance.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.018
I have a brand-new routine
that is steamy.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.454
- Boyle, we're looking
for splashy, not steamy,

11:56.498 --> 11:57.978
but thank you.
- Well, steam is what

11:58.021 --> 11:59.675
you get when you add
splash to fire.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.068
- And we will not
keep you in mind.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.417
Hey, that reminds me,
Gina, we still haven't

12:02.460 --> 12:04.071
secured a celebrity guest
for the party.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.768
How would you feel about the
guy who shot that video

12:05.812 --> 12:07.291
of that rat
smoking a vape pen?

12:07.335 --> 12:08.902
- Can we get the rat?
- Pretty sure the rat

12:08.945 --> 12:10.338
is just a big ball of tumors
at this point.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.774
Is that the vibe
you're going for?

12:11.818 --> 12:12.993
- Maybe.
- If you want a celebrity,

12:13.036 --> 12:15.343
I met Leroy Pipe
at Gyna-rama '08.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.824
- I have a buddy who works
in private security.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.477
They do protection
for tons of big names.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.827
He'll know who's in town.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.785
- Fantastic.
Please call him right now.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.528
- No need. Leroy Pipe is in!
All he needs is bail money.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.660
- Great. But also, Terry,
you still call your guy.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.924
- Gotcha.
- Gina, big news.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.273
Terry's friend got back to us

12:32.316 --> 12:33.796
and he says
they're doing security

12:33.840 --> 12:35.798
for Bayside High's number one
wrestler:

12:35.842 --> 12:36.799
A.C. Slater.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.453
That's right, Mario Lopez.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.629
- Oh, my God.
I had such a big crush on him.

12:40.672 --> 12:43.153
- Yeah, we all had a big crush
on A.C. Slater.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.199
Get in line!

12:45.242 --> 12:46.766
I'll be cooler
when we meet him.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.637
- I should hope so.
- Anyways, he's hanging out

12:48.680 --> 12:49.856
at the Manhattan Club
right now.

12:49.899 --> 12:50.987
We can go there
and try and talk to him.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.336
- Jake, you can't just walk

12:52.380 --> 12:54.686
into the Manhattan Club.
It's very exclusive.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.906
- Like, how exclusive are we
talking here, Gines? No jeans?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.212
- More.
- No poor people of any kind

12:58.255 --> 12:59.430
no matter how well
they hide it?

12:59.474 --> 13:00.823
- More.
- Just a tiny slice

13:00.867 --> 13:01.824
of the super rich?
- More.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.130
- Is it all Illuminati?

13:03.173 --> 13:04.261
Is it just a whole room
full of lizards?

13:04.305 --> 13:05.828
- Bingo.
- Well, then I guess

13:05.872 --> 13:07.699
we'll have to transform
ourselves.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.179
Into the uber wealthy.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.106
Charles!
Turn that music off.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.455
- Oh, sorry. I was just
practicing

13:24.499 --> 13:26.109
in case you guys
change your mind.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.546
- Okay, we're about to walk
into the land of money.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.549
Remember, all rich people are
monsters, so unleash the beast.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.855
- Got it.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.465
Open it!

13:35.902 --> 13:37.120
- Good afternoon.
May I help you?

13:37.164 --> 13:38.252
- We're here all the time.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.731
Get familiar with these faces,

13:39.775 --> 13:41.472
or get familiar
with the unemployment line.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.866
- I'm so sorry, but I have to
check you in.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.128
I need a member number.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.739
- I don't have my member number
with me.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.220
It's too bad you can't just use
my AmEx black card.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.787
- Oh, that's great.
We can use that.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.310
- You can? Well.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.225
You think I carry around
my own wallet?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.883
- I'm sorry, sir. If you could
just give me a name,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.058
that would be great.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.538
- I'll give you a name:

14:03.581 --> 14:05.018
Pamplemouse La Croix.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.758
- I'm so sorry, Ms. La Croix,

14:06.802 --> 14:07.759
you're not in the system.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.891
- This is ridiculous.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.066
You know what?

14:10.110 --> 14:11.938
Call Daddy.
Daddy'll get us in.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.028
- Daddy, the man won't let us
into the club.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.987
- Oh, ho, ho.
- Yes, Daddy. No, Daddy, no.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.207
Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Gladly.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.427
Hello, Daddy? Yes, Daddy.
NO, Daddy.

14:23.471 --> 14:24.341
Daddy!

14:24.385 --> 14:26.213
Oh, well, good question, Daddy.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.345
Daddy wants to get
this young man fired.

14:28.389 --> 14:29.999
What is
your first and last name?

14:30.043 --> 14:31.958
Uh..

14:32.001 --> 14:34.395
You know what, forget about it.
You can just go on up.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.572
- Fantastic.
Everything's well, Daddy.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.835
We're heading in, Daddy.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.532
Gina, the bathrooms here are
amazing.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.273
I just peed on gold.
I peed on gold!

14:43.317 --> 14:45.014
- That's so dope,
but we don't have time.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.711
Mario Lopez is right there
in the VIP.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.278
- So, how do we get him
to come to your party?

14:48.322 --> 14:49.453
Say we're his biggest fans?
- No, Jake.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.412
Celebrities despise their fans.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.109
You get into entertainment
to be removed

14:53.153 --> 14:54.981
from general society.
- Oh, okay.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.808
So what do we say?
- Well, whilst stars

14:56.852 --> 14:58.462
hate people,
they love animals.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.638
'Cause animals have bad bodies
so they're no competition.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.727
- Okay, so we say the party
is for monkeys.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.947
- Monkeys with malaria.
- Malnourished malaria monkeys.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.644
- God, it's ridiculous how good
we are at this.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.429
Let's go in.
- Wait, I don't think

15:08.472 --> 15:10.039
there's any way we're getting
past those security guards.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.606
We need a distraction.
Ooh, how about this.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.868
I'll sprint past them,

15:12.912 --> 15:13.869
and whilst
they're chasing after me,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.479
you sneak into the VIP.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.699
- Wow, we said "whilst" twice
in this conversation.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.831
- I know, this place is really
rubbing off on us.

15:22.878 --> 15:27.274
Heads up! Catch me if you--
did! You immediately did!

15:27.317 --> 15:31.017
Stop it! I'm telling Daddy!
Daddy!

15:32.018 --> 15:34.237
Ow. Ow. Ow.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.412
Hey.
- Hey, homey. You okay?

15:35.456 --> 15:36.848
- Yeah, I'm totally fine.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.111
It really wasn't that bad
of a beating.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.503
I don't know
why I'm lying.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.983
You were there.
You held me as I wept.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.680
Anyways,
sorry that Gina-rama has been

15:42.724 --> 15:43.986
a little basic so far,

15:44.030 --> 15:45.509
but all of that
is about to change.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.685
Because guess who just
pulled up outside?

15:47.729 --> 15:53.343
- He came?
Together: A.C. Sla-t-er!

15:53.387 --> 15:55.389
- Yes, dude!

15:55.432 --> 15:56.433
- I'm sorry!

15:56.477 --> 15:59.088
- Everyone, be cool!
He's here!

16:00.220 --> 16:02.874
- Hey, is this
the hungry monkey thing?

16:02.918 --> 16:05.138
- It sure is, A.C. Slater!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lopez.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.183
I know you're not actually
the very iconic character

16:07.227 --> 16:08.706
that you played.
- You sure about that, preppy?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.578
-  This is the best
moment of my life.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.710
- So what's up? Can I, uh,
come in and get a drink?

16:12.754 --> 16:15.191
- Mm, actually, I'm sorry,
the venue's at capacity.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.063
There's just too many people
inside.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.238
- What?
- Wait, I was told

16:18.281 --> 16:19.761
that this event depended on me.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.589
You just begged me, like,
an hour ago.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.460
- And now I'm begging you
to stop embarrassing yourself

16:23.504 --> 16:24.809
'cause it's not a good shade
on you.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.550
- Are you really not gonna
let me in?

16:26.594 --> 16:28.248
- There's nothing I can do,
I'm sor--hey, Scully.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.033
- Hi, Gina. I brought
my own pigs in a blanket!

16:31.077 --> 16:32.556
- Dope.
- Who's that guy?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.037
- Scully.
- Mario, you gotta calm down.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.865
And you gotta walk away.
It's over.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.217
Hey, Gina!

16:41.261 --> 16:43.176
What are you doing?
We had A.C. Slater right there

16:43.219 --> 16:44.438
and you turned him away?
- And that, Jake,

16:44.481 --> 16:45.874
was your Gina Moment.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.572
- What? But that sucked.
Why was mine a bad one?

16:48.616 --> 16:50.531
- Because Jake, I wanted you
to understand

16:50.574 --> 16:53.360
I don't need a celebrity
or some crazy venue

16:53.403 --> 16:54.970
or a huge good-bye party.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.450
This is what I wanted.

16:56.493 --> 16:59.279
Just to hang with my friends
and have a few drinks

16:59.322 --> 17:02.108
and laugh at Charles
with his devil sticks

17:02.151 --> 17:04.023
until he makes eye contact--

17:04.066 --> 17:05.546
you're killing it, bud.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.114
You guys are
all the splash that I need.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.768
- Oh, man.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.422
Gina.
- Mm-hmm.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.424
- You big cheese ball.
- I know.

17:14.468 --> 17:17.601
Plus, it's so cool that I got
to turn a celebrity

17:17.645 --> 17:20.474
away from my party. That was
kinda my Gina Moment for me.

17:20.517 --> 17:21.736
I've always wanted to do that.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.564
- Right. Right.
- Hey, um...

17:23.607 --> 17:25.914
It's raining outside.
Is it cool if I just wait here

17:25.957 --> 17:28.134
until my car comes?
- Get out of here, Slater!

17:28.177 --> 17:30.092
Get out! Yeah?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.441
- Yeah!

17:34.401 --> 17:35.750
- I can't believe Gina's gone.

17:35.793 --> 17:36.925
- Me neither.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.231
Hey, did you get
a Gina Moment?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.841
She said she was giving one
to everyone,

17:39.884 --> 17:41.147
but I didn't get mine.
- 'Sup, losers.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.018
- Oh! What are you doing here,
Gina?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.412
- Are you back? Did my begging
change your mind?

17:45.455 --> 17:47.588
- Nah, dog. I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.199
- Gina, why are you still here?
- Jeez. What's the big deal?

17:50.243 --> 17:52.332
- It's just you made us all
toasts at Gina-rama

17:52.375 --> 17:54.986
and say tearful goodbyes,
but now you're still here.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.597
- I'm not back. I'm just
cleaning out my desk

17:56.640 --> 18:00.035
And I have some stuff
I wanted to give to you guys.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.472
Charles, weirdly,
you're kind of the person

18:02.516 --> 18:04.431
I'm the closest to here.
Don't say why.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.128
- Because I was your brother
and your lover?

18:06.172 --> 18:07.999
Sorry, I can't control
my tongue around you.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.349
- All right, well, here.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.307
- The Boyle family mother
dough starter!

18:11.351 --> 18:13.179
I'll think of you
every time I handle her.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.224
- Oh, man. You know, I never
really understood

18:15.268 --> 18:17.226
the logic behind
the two of us.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.228
But I love you
and I'm gonna miss you.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.361
- I'm gonna miss you too, Gina.
- You're getting cold feet.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.276
I mean, why haven't you cleaned
out your desk

18:23.319 --> 18:26.235
over your last two weeks?
- Because, Terry, I was busy

18:26.279 --> 18:29.282
giving each and every one of
you a beautiful GM.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.285
- Well, not all of us.
- Oh, Terry, that reminds me.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.330
Rosa, do you want this plant?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
- Yeah. I mess with orchids.
- Great.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.378
Well, that about wraps up
everything I meant to do.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.727
- Come on.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.425
- I wonder if Holt's gonna hire
a new assistant.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.340
- Well, he can't hire someone
permanent right away.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.342
He needs a rebound assistant
first.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.649
- It's gonna be so weird
seeing someone at Gina's--

18:48.692 --> 18:50.738
Oh. She's still here.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.435
- Gina, what's going on?
- Cold feet.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.568
She's never going to leave.
- No, I wanted to make sure

18:54.611 --> 18:57.136
Holt was familiar
with my filing system.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.789
I didn't want to
leave him in the dark.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.139
- There are no dividers.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.053
It's just a big pile
of loose papers.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.707
- Okay, yeah, you get it.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.187
I'll stick around
the rest of the day

19:05.231 --> 19:06.188
in case you have
any questions.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.494
- Never gonna leave!

19:07.537 --> 19:09.757
- She's definitely
still gonna be here.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.020
- No way. She's gone.
Hah! Look!

19:12.063 --> 19:13.282
Her desk, I told you,
it's empty.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.197
- She's right over there
burning stuff.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.157
- I'm just sage-ing. Trying to
clear this place of my energy.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.549
- Why?
- Cold feet.

19:19.593 --> 19:22.291
- No. No one's paying me
for my vibes anymore.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.032
I'm not trying to give 'em away
for free.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.947
- Oh, my God.
I know what's going on.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.427
Gina, you're having second
thoughts.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.950
You have cold feet.
I figured it out!

19:28.993 --> 19:30.473
- Jake for the win.
There you go.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.301
- Come on, man!
- I never have second thoughts.

19:32.345 --> 19:35.174
That's the luxury of having
great first thoughts.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.045
- Gina, it's okay.
You're scared.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.481
- Tare-bear, I love you,
but don't try

19:38.525 --> 19:39.961
and hop on my thing, okay?
- But for real.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.223
I'm not scared.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.879
- Hey, guys. You were right.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.055
I'm scared as hell.
Anyway.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.536
I'm here all day.
- Huh.

19:49.579 --> 19:52.321
All right. I think we need to
all get on the same page

19:52.365 --> 19:54.018
for what do to
about this Gina situation.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.324
- Well, we should tell her
we believe in her.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.065
- Good point, Charles.
- And we all know

19:57.108 --> 19:58.371
she'll succeed
at whatever she tries.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.242
- I feel like this is
all my fault.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.462
She's staying for me.
She just can't let go.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.028
- Hitchcock, you don't have to
contribute.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.160
All right, guys, let's get in
there

20:05.204 --> 20:06.640
and support the hell
out of Gina.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.991
What is that?

20:10.034 --> 20:11.079
- It's a statue of her.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.254
- Texting on her phone.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.865
- Guys, look, there's a note.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.302
- Hello, Nine-Nine.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.391
I just wanted to thank
you guys.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.175
I was so nervous to move on

20:20.219 --> 20:22.003
and I even started
to doubt myself,

20:22.046 --> 20:23.439
which is crazy.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.094
And your kind words really
helped me,

20:26.137 --> 20:28.705
especially yours, Terry.
- Aww.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.272
- Psych!

20:30.316 --> 20:32.579
Did he fall f--
Terry, did you fall for it?

20:32.622 --> 20:35.234
Anyway, Terry,
that's your Gina Moment.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.453
- Seriously? I've known her
for seven years.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.282
- JK again. I'm really gonna
miss you, Sarge.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.936
I signed you up
for an international

20:41.979 --> 20:43.285
yogurt of the month club.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.374
Austria is in the fridge
right now.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.420
- Terry's never had
Austrian yogurt before.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.248
Terry had the best moment
of all.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.250
- Anyway, I didn't doubt
myself for one second.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.121
And I'm more confident
than I've ever been.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.819
I was only stalling because
there was a shipping delay

20:55.863 --> 20:58.039
with my golden statue.
- Ah, that makes sense.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.433
- And even though she looks
like she has wet hair

21:00.476 --> 21:03.305
and just combed through
a deep conditioning treatment,

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
and even though her jeans
look cheap

21:05.351 --> 21:07.570
and even though she has
sausage fingers,

21:07.614 --> 21:10.399
I hope it reminds you of me,
and I'm gonna miss you.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.489
I'll hold now for a five
minute applause break.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.666
Do it! Please.

21:18.364 --> 21:21.323
- Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.629
- This feels right.

21:22.672 --> 21:23.847
- I love you guys.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.849
- Fremulon.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.851
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
