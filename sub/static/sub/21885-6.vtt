00:17.268 --> 00:18.477
Hello.
- Oh!

00:19.186 --> 00:20.521
S... sorry.

00:20.604 --> 00:24.984
To activate your Janet,
press nose for three seconds.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.360
OK, OK.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.404
Um, can you walk yet?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.281
Here.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.325
Oh.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.244
Hello, I'm Janet.
- Shh.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.413
Hello.
- Shh.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.083
Hello, I'm Janet.
- I really need you to shut up.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.011
Where did you get this?

00:52.094 --> 00:53.971
Did you actually get
into the Good Place somehow?

00:54.055 --> 00:57.808
Didn't need to. They keep their Janets
in a neutral pocket dimension

00:57.892 --> 00:59.435
beneath the shapeless time void.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.520
It's right next to Accounting.

01:01.604 --> 01:04.774
And you just walked in and stole her?
It was that easy?

01:04.857 --> 01:07.443
You didn't have to choke out an angel
or anything?

01:07.526 --> 01:09.070
Doors were unlocked, no security.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.237
I mean, it makes sense, right?

01:10.321 --> 01:13.741
They're good, so they're stupid and trusting.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.243
I understand that you need the four humans
to think they're in the Good Place

01:16.327 --> 01:19.163
but using an actual
Good Place Janet seems risky.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.124
Why don't you just have a Bad Place Janet
pretend to be good?

01:22.208 --> 01:24.085
I thought of that, but... watch.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.754
Bad Janet?
- What up, skidmarks?

01:26.837 --> 01:30.549
Let's try that thing again
where you pretend to be a Good Janet.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.467
OK?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.511
Now, really... really try your best.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.137
Fine.
- Say, Janet.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.973
Where can I get some delicious ice-cream?

01:38.057 --> 01:41.727
Oh, there's a wonderful parlour
in the middle of town square.

01:41.811 --> 01:44.605
My favourite flavour is rocky road.

01:44.688 --> 01:49.568
It contains chocolate ribbon,
marshmallows, and your...

01:49.652 --> 01:54.073
dad's salty nuts, you fat dink!

01:59.328 --> 02:01.622
I see what you mean. Use the Good one.

02:04.375 --> 02:09.130
Janet, you and I are about
to have a real adventure together.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.883
Wait a second, Janet.
What are you telling me?

02:12.967 --> 02:15.177
Are you saying that
because you're glitching out--

02:15.261 --> 02:17.596
The Neighborhood is in danger
of total collapse.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.806
Fun fact -

02:18.848 --> 02:22.643
mathematically, it's equally likely to either
im-or-explode.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.645
OK, OK.

02:25.688 --> 02:29.692
So I suppose the next question should be,
"What's causing the problem?"

02:29.775 --> 02:33.529
Unclear. The glitches started out small,
and then began to escalate.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.615
And then I came here looking for help,
and then I started talking.

02:36.699 --> 02:40.786
And then you looked at me, annoyed,
like that, and now here we are.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.746
OK. Alright.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.625
Yeah, this is very bad.
Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.918
You got it!

02:50.880 --> 02:54.175
A little short on time here, Janet.
- It's just a little hard to get out.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.760
Almost got it.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.471
Here it is.

03:00.723 --> 03:01.807
My user manual.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.602
OK. Let's get started.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.569
"Hello, and welcome to your new Janet."

03:13.652 --> 03:17.781
"Janets are brought to you by the makers
of light, darkness, and everything."

03:17.865 --> 03:19.617
I need to skip ahead here.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.827
Where's the, uh, troubleshooting part?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.204
Michael.
- Hmm?

03:23.287 --> 03:24.413
What's with the earthquake?

03:24.496 --> 03:27.166
Janet's experiencing
a slight technical issue.

03:27.249 --> 03:28.417
Ew. What's wrong with it?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.879
Oh, um, uh...
- I tried to eat some frozen yogurt.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.298
It looked so good,
but I'm not supposed to eat anything.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.883
So there was a little earthquake.

03:38.302 --> 03:42.139
See? There it is again.
- Can't you just reset these things?

03:42.223 --> 03:44.767
What do you do again?
Oh, it's the ears, yeah?

03:44.850 --> 03:47.144
It's... it's, uh... It's down, down, out...

03:47.228 --> 03:49.772
Vicky, can I... can I speak to you
just for a second outside?

03:49.855 --> 03:53.150
Look, this is a common problem,
and I've got it under control.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.485
I don't know, man.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.863
First you went rogue at the party with
your sports car and your weird earring...

03:59.198 --> 04:00.950
And now Janet's breaking down? I mean...

04:01.033 --> 04:05.079
it's like you're begging me
to tell Shawn that you're incompetent.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.538
<i>Begging.</i>

04:06.622 --> 04:09.124
Vicky, this is a temporary problem.
I promise.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.835
Hey, you know who could use some torturing
right now?

04:12.211 --> 04:14.213
Chidi.
- Oh!

04:14.296 --> 04:15.923
I love torturing Chidi.
- I know.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.384
No, actually,
I had this great idea the other night.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.552
Thought it was worth exploring. Picture this.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.763
Needles.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.141
Oh, that's the whole idea.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.559
Yeah, yeah.
- Needles.

04:27.643 --> 04:28.811
Genius, right?
- Yeah.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.812
I mean, needles!

04:29.895 --> 04:32.523
Oh, wonderful. Wonderful. So smart.
- Yeah.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.775
Needles. Yeah, run with that.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.529
OK, hopefully bought us a little time.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.489
Where were we? Uh...

04:40.572 --> 04:42.157
Oh, here we go, yeah. Glitches!

04:42.241 --> 04:45.411
"In the event of malfunction,
run the following tests."

04:45.494 --> 04:48.163
"First test, Basic Corporeal Function."

04:48.247 --> 04:49.415
Hop up on the table there.

04:57.256 --> 04:58.132
Alright, great.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.512
Ninety-nine-point-seven trillion degrees.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.639
A little bit on the high side, but no biggie.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.224
And...

05:07.683 --> 05:09.101
still no blood!

05:09.184 --> 05:11.770
Oh, thank goodness. OK, what's next?

05:11.854 --> 05:13.522
"Summoning and Retrieval."

05:13.605 --> 05:18.235
"Have Janet produce an object,
using the random object generator programme."

05:18.319 --> 05:20.446
OK...

05:21.488 --> 05:24.283
A 14-ounce ostrich steak

05:24.366 --> 05:29.788
impaled on a giant novelty pencil
that says "Lordy Lordy, I'm Over 40."

05:29.872 --> 05:30.956
Here you go.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.460
"Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40." Perfect.

05:35.461 --> 05:37.421
OK, third test.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.173
"Informational Accuracy."

05:39.256 --> 05:41.175
"Glitches may be a sign that..."

05:43.093 --> 05:44.720
You didn't finish your sentence.

05:45.387 --> 05:48.682
"Glitches may be a sign
that your Janet is..."

05:48.766 --> 05:55.356
"processing or disseminating information
that is incompatible with objective truth."

05:56.106 --> 05:58.233
They're talking about lying, Janet.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.946
This is all my fault.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.868
I told you a lie that first day we met.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.747
OK.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.249
Here goes nothing.

06:19.630 --> 06:23.717
Hello, I'm Janet,
and I have now been fully activated!

06:23.801 --> 06:28.013
Hello, Janet. I'm Michael,
a Good Place architect.

06:28.597 --> 06:32.017
One of the best. Top-notch.
You're in luck, here.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.560
Happy to meet you, Michael.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.146
I will help you make the perfect
Neighbourhood.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.439
Would you like to get started?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.441
Uh, one small note there, Janet.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.944
Uh, the Neighbourhood that I want to build

06:42.027 --> 06:46.198
might be a little different from the ones
that you might be familiar with.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.409
Is that alright?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.701
Of course, silly billy!

06:49.785 --> 06:51.245
I build and operate the Neighbourhood

06:51.328 --> 06:54.957
but every aspect
of the design is entirely up to you!

06:55.040 --> 06:59.086
For example, if you'd like me to stop
calling you "silly billy," just say so!

06:59.169 --> 07:01.755
Yeah, I don't like that at all.
Michael's fine.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.132
Sounds good, Michael.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.008
I will keep this Neighbourhood functioning

07:05.092 --> 07:08.429
and I will make no judgments
on its rules or residents.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.056
And although I don't technically
report to you...

07:11.140 --> 07:15.811
I will do everything I can to make
your Neighbourhood neighbour-good!

07:20.274 --> 07:21.400
I lied to you.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.737
I lied about who I was and...

07:26.613 --> 07:28.115
what we were doing.

07:28.198 --> 07:32.077
And then I lied a billion more times
to support that first lie.

07:33.162 --> 07:35.080
And now you're all discombobulated.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.999
It's... it's my fault.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.709
Nope. You're wrong.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.253
If the glitching was only a result
of you lying to me

07:41.336 --> 07:43.380
why wouldn't I have been glitching all along?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.174
Why would it only be starting now?

07:45.257 --> 07:47.676
Well, uh... that's a good point.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.178
I know, right!

07:49.219 --> 07:51.138
May--
- Excuse us, Michael

07:51.221 --> 07:53.432
but we've been trying to call Janet
and she isn't answering.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.850
Hi, guys, I'm broken.

07:54.933 --> 07:58.228
Uh, yeah, I had to take her offline
for a system check.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.189
- She'll be available real soon.
- Cool.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.608
Because I'm just so freakin' excited
because Tahani said

08:02.691 --> 08:04.276
she's never had jalapeño poppers

08:04.359 --> 08:06.028
and I wanted to get some for her.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.488
They sound so disgusting.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.949
But if Jason likes them,
then maybe I will too.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.828
Because we are together.
I can finally admit that.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.582
Aw, babe, you admitted it! That's sweet.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.709
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You two are sleeping together?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.419
Only when we're done having sex.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.047
Anyways, Janet, can you help us?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.090
As soon as Michael puts me back online

08:27.174 --> 08:31.011
I'd be more than happy to help you
get that extra-special gift for Tahani!

08:34.014 --> 08:35.182
Whoa...

08:35.224 --> 08:36.308
What's happening?

08:37.559 --> 08:38.727
Oh, boy.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.187
What the...

08:41.605 --> 08:42.981
Oh, man.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.733
We got robbed!

08:44.775 --> 08:47.903
They took the walls, they took the floor,
and we were standing here the whole time!

08:48.445 --> 08:49.905
These guys are good.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.784
Michael! What do we do?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.873
OK, there we go!
Nothing to worry about.

08:59.957 --> 09:03.168
Happens, sometimes.
Perfectly normal. Let's go.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.586
Is Janet going to be alright?

09:04.670 --> 09:07.589
Totally fine. Please just go back
to your house and wait for her there.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.259
She'll show up shortly
with lots of jalapeño poppers.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.426
And cheesy fries?
- Mm-hm.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.553
With donkey sauce?
- Sure.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.555
And a cool hat?

09:15.931 --> 09:18.183
OK, we'll leave.
Hope you feel better, Janet!

09:18.767 --> 09:19.643
OK...

09:19.726 --> 09:21.895
So, I don't seem to be getting better.

09:23.105 --> 09:27.192
That glitch appears to have been limited
to this building, so Vicky won't know.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.318
That's the good news.

09:28.402 --> 09:32.239
The bad news is, I seem to be losing
my ability to sustain object permanence.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.740
So, it's sort of a "glass half-full"

09:33.824 --> 09:36.243
"glass-stops-existing-in-time-and-space"
kinda deal.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.245
OK, let's walk through what just happened.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.497
Jason and Tahani came in.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.334
Revealed the crazy fact
that they're now in a relationship.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.671
I already knew that
and I am so happy for them.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.007
Blah!

09:51.425 --> 09:53.218
Ahhhh...

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
Janet, tell me a lie.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.645
Janets can't lie.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.147
You lied to Vicky earlier.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.441
Interesting... I guess I did.

10:08.191 --> 10:12.154
I suppose after 802 reboots,
I must have gained the ability to lie.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.990
That's fun! I want to try to lie again.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.658
I love your outfit.

10:29.046 --> 10:32.049
"Incompatible with objective truth."

10:33.133 --> 10:37.095
Janet, the problem isn't me lying to you,
but rather you lying to other people.

10:37.179 --> 10:41.308
Like when you said to Jason,
"I'd be happy to help you and Tahani"

10:41.391 --> 10:42.768
that was a lie.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.853
No, it wasn't.
I'm always happy to help people.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.104
That's my main purpose.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.106
I know, I know, but it was still a lie

10:48.190 --> 10:49.566
even though you didn't intend it to be

10:49.650 --> 10:51.943
because you weren't actually happy
to help them.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.821
Because you're in love with Jason.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.115
Say what now?

10:57.199 --> 10:59.618
After the very first time you were rebooted

10:59.701 --> 11:02.829
and as you were
slowly regaining your knowledge

11:02.913 --> 11:05.207
you bonded with Jason.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.292
The two of you got "married"

11:07.376 --> 11:11.838
and I think somehow, you're still,
deep down, in love with him.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.549
Ha! No. That is impossible.

11:14.633 --> 11:18.345
Think logically - when was the first glitch?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.431
When I said I was happy to give
Jason and Tahani couples' therapy.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.058
And the second glitch?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.893
When I said I was happy to see them
embracing.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.770
And the third glitch, the earthquake?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.690
When I said I was happy
that I had helped improve their relationship.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.276
Ohhhhhhh, nuts!

11:33.360 --> 11:35.487
Yeah...
- But I am happy for them.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.988
I am. I am.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.907
Am I? I am. I am not.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.243
I am not! I am not that.
I am not happy for them.

11:43.036 --> 11:47.124
But how is this possible? I don't have
any memory of being married to Jason.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.336
You said yourself that Janets get more
sophisticated every time they're rebooted.

11:51.420 --> 11:56.133
Well, maybe you falling in love with Jason
was some sort of mutation

11:56.216 --> 11:59.010
that then was amplified with each reboot.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.513
OK, that makes total sense.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.181
I know what you have to do now.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.099
Kill me!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.768
Sorry, I say everything in a cheery manner.

12:06.852 --> 12:09.146
But in this case,
it may be inappropriate. So, I'll try again.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.524
You have to kill me, Michael.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.736
Better?
- Janet, I can't reboot you.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.447
That will just intensify your feelings
for Jason

12:18.530 --> 12:20.824
and that's what got us
into this mess in the first place.

12:20.907 --> 12:25.454
I'm not saying reboot me.
I'm saying, set me to "self-destruct."

12:28.707 --> 12:32.878
"In the event of continued malfunction,
hold down Janet's nose"

12:32.961 --> 12:35.839
"and insert paper clip
into small hole behind left ear."

12:35.922 --> 12:36.965
Yeah, right here.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.426
"Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself."

12:39.509 --> 12:43.180
"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble,
she can be launched into space"

12:43.263 --> 12:45.766
"through an inter-dimensional suction tube"

12:45.932 --> 12:48.059
"or eaten as a midday snack."

12:48.143 --> 12:51.646
I'm very high in potassium - like a banana!

12:51.730 --> 12:54.065
"A new Janet will need to be procured"

12:54.149 --> 12:57.277
"in order to return the Neighbourhood
to functionality."

12:57.861 --> 13:02.032
Easy, I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet,
and everything will go back to normal!

13:02.115 --> 13:04.826
Well, not for me. I'll be a lifeless marble
floating through space

13:04.910 --> 13:06.661
but you'll be back to normal!

13:10.957 --> 13:13.960
Are you sure this is what you want -
to self-destruct?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.254
What I really want is to stay
and serve the Neighbourhood.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.383
But due to my feelings for Jason,
I'm putting him and everyone else at risk.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.969
So, looks like it's, <i>whoosh...</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:24.888
<i>A dios, Janito!</i>

13:24.971 --> 13:27.098
Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.352
Um, but you didn't give me a heads-up
about this new Vicky torture.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.939
Uh, the one with the
the needles in my face?

13:34.022 --> 13:36.483
- Little busy here, bud.
- Yeah, totally, totally.

13:37.192 --> 13:42.447
I don't want to be a nudge, but is there
anything else coming down the pike

13:42.531 --> 13:45.075
that you forgot to mention?
- I honestly don't know.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.995
But I have bigger fish to fry, so, you know,
just, just walk it off.

13:49.079 --> 13:54.000
Well, I would love to walk it off,
but my feet have needles in them!

13:54.084 --> 13:55.836
I don't know what to tell ya.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.505
OK, but--
- OK, self-destruct time.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.340
Hey, how about this?

14:00.757 --> 14:03.593
What if we just reboot Jason?

14:03.677 --> 14:07.264
I mean, how long could it take him to relearn
the five things he knows, am I right?

14:07.347 --> 14:11.017
How dare you! You're talking about the man
I was just informed that I love!

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
Right. Sorry.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.522
Marble-ise me, Michael. It's the only choice.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.482
I won't feel any pain or anything.

14:17.566 --> 14:21.736
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill--

14:21.820 --> 14:25.615
I really don't want to do this, Janet.
But I suppose it makes sense.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.701
Great! Grab a paper clip.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.923
OK, that was the last pudding shop.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.134
Great, should I begin
to welcome the residents?

14:44.801 --> 14:47.429
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
This is all wrong.

14:47.512 --> 14:51.725
Pudding restaurant?
What even is that? Pudding won't work.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.560
It's OK, Michael. Just relax.
- Ah...

14:53.643 --> 14:58.148
I can't, Janet!
My design has to be perfect for me to, to...

14:59.107 --> 15:03.445
In order to accomplish what I need
to accomplish. Oh...

15:04.905 --> 15:08.533
Whoa, I'm way out on a limb here.

15:08.617 --> 15:11.661
And I'm all alone.
- No, you're not. You have me...

15:11.745 --> 15:13.747
Oh!
- ...Janet. I can help you.

15:13.830 --> 15:18.043
It's too hard to explain, but there are
certain aspects of my plan that...

15:18.126 --> 15:19.920
that you just can't understand.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.129
Try me.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.714
Yeah.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.886
Alright, fine, fine. Uh, Janet, uh...

15:27.969 --> 15:32.349
What's a food that people think they enjoy,
but that's also kind of a bummer?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.185
Frozen yoghurt.
- Oh! Oh, yes!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.354
Frozen yogurt!

15:37.562 --> 15:39.606
Oh, Janet! You're a genius.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.567
Correct. I know literally everything.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.778
But why do you want a food...?
- No, no, don't don't worry about that.

15:46.029 --> 15:49.658
Oh, yeah, OK, let's make
all these restaurants frozen yogurt.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.451
Okie-dokie.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.331
Would you like to try it?
- Oh, yeah.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.670
It's just... OK.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.131
Which means... it's perfect.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.675
Let's bring in the residents.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.344
I don't know what just happened,
but I'm happy you're happy!

16:12.681 --> 16:13.723
Michael?

16:14.933 --> 16:18.436
Hm? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yes, sorry.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.360
Oh... I can't do it.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.613
Come on, dude.
- It's dangerous, is what it is.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.908
Vicky could find out, and then the...
you know, the... plan, the whole plan...

16:31.992 --> 16:35.286
It's bad for the plan, Janet.
That, that's the reason.

16:35.370 --> 16:39.833
I don't understand. Given the situation,
it's far safer to initiate the self-destruct.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.167
Hmm.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.506
OK, look, see, here, here...
here's the reason.

16:46.589 --> 16:51.219
See, I promised the four humans that we would
escape to the Good Place once and for all

16:51.302 --> 16:55.306
and without you, we stand zero chance
of ever making it there.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.933
The new Janet will be able to help you
with that.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.395
Well, alright, but it's not only that though,
see, it's also because of, um...

17:00.478 --> 17:02.939
Well, what if Vicky found out?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.399
You already asked me that.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.152
Why are you making such a big deal
about turning me into a marble forever?

17:07.235 --> 17:09.779
Because of reasons. There are reasons!

17:09.863 --> 17:12.991
They exist and I just don't want
to explain them right now.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.200
What are the reasons?

17:14.284 --> 17:16.953
There are reasons, Janet!
- OK, but what are they?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.830
The reason is friends!

17:25.837 --> 17:29.007
You're my friend, Janet.
That, that's why I can't kill you.

17:30.008 --> 17:33.928
We have been through so much together.
I mean, yeah, sure, for you...

17:34.012 --> 17:37.140
You know, each time I rebooted you,
you, you "met" me all over again.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.853
But for me, our... our relationship
has become important.

17:42.645 --> 17:45.106
You're my oldest, my truest...

17:46.274 --> 17:48.485
my most loyal friend.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.361
I can't just get rid of you and...

17:51.446 --> 17:54.449
replace you with some other Janet
I don't even know.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.169
Well, well, well...

18:06.252 --> 18:08.296
Yeah, don't, don't do that, just lay off.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.672
Michael!

18:11.257 --> 18:12.634
That was so nice of you.

18:13.802 --> 18:14.928
I'm glad you said that.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.639
Well... I mean it.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.809
Look at us - a couple of old pals.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.187
Trying to make our way in this crazy world...

18:24.646 --> 18:25.605
that I built.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.482
Two peas in a pod.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.610
One of whom needs to kill the other one,
immediately.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.532
No. No, there has to be another way.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.576
This problem you're facing,
it's about emotion, right?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.120
That's a human problem.

18:40.203 --> 18:44.040
So maybe we should consult our most
problematic human.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.794
So, let me get this straight.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.672
You want me to convince Michael
to turn you into a marble.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.423
Because you're causing earthquakes

18:52.507 --> 18:54.425
because you're sad about Jason

18:54.509 --> 18:58.138
to whom you were once married,
because he's currently sleeping with Tahani.

18:58.221 --> 18:59.514
Correct.
- I don't think

18:59.597 --> 19:02.308
I've ever meant this literally,
but that might be too much information.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.812
First of all, I totally get the Jason thing.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.691
I mean, he's a ding-dong,
but also a straight hottie, so up top.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.651
But more important...

19:11.734 --> 19:15.071
what you're going through is something
every person has gone through.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.282
Not a person.
- Actually, right now...

19:17.365 --> 19:21.452
you kind of are, because you just found out
your ex is dating someone else.

19:21.536 --> 19:26.207
And yeah, it sucks, but trust me,
it's not worth all this drama.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.710
You just need to get drunk and go dancing.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.337
You'll forget all about Jason.
Can you get drunk?

19:31.421 --> 19:34.549
Not really. Although, if I stand
next to a powerful array of magnets

19:34.632 --> 19:36.176
I do get pretty loopy.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.428
Do that. Pop a couple magnets.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.555
Listen to some "No Doubt", dye your hair.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.807
You'll be totally fine in, like, two seconds.

19:42.891 --> 19:48.313
I mean, honestly, the best move
is to get another dude, and just go to town.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.649
Rebound guy! But I guess, here,
your options are pretty limited.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.902
What about Michael?
- Extraordinarily bad idea.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.528
Yeah. Right. Forget it.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.864
But... you don't need to worry.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.240
You're awesome.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.367
You contain all the knowledge
in the universe.

20:01.451 --> 20:05.121
You have a rippin' bod,
and you can literally do anything!

20:05.997 --> 20:07.207
This is just a blip.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.668
So, was it helpful?

20:10.752 --> 20:14.589
Yes, Eleanor told me that instead of
being sad, I should "go get it, girl!"

20:14.672 --> 20:16.341
So, I'm going to go get it, girl!

20:16.424 --> 20:17.508
Get what?
- Unclear.

20:17.592 --> 20:18.760
I'll get everything, just to be safe.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.720
And I should be able to avoid glitches

20:20.803 --> 20:23.223
by watching what I say
around Jason and Tahani.

20:23.306 --> 20:27.101
Ah! Thank you for your help.
I'm so glad we're friends.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.269
Me too.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.064
And since we're friends,
I can tell you this honestly.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.733
Take that outfit out of rotation.
It makes you look bottom-heavy.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.860
It does, doesn't it?

20:36.486 --> 20:39.239
If it's OK with you, I'm going
to go to my void for a little while.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.742
I just need to spend some time alone
and focus on myself.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.411
Take all the time you need.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.331
- Hi there.
- Hello!

20:49.832 --> 20:51.292
Janet, who's that man?

20:51.376 --> 20:53.962
This is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek.
I made him.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.172
Hi, I'm Derek.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.298
You must be Mich...

20:57.382 --> 20:58.925
Ohhh.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.177
OK, that makes more sense.

21:01.719 --> 21:05.014
You must be Michael. Janet's made a lot
of talk-talk into my ear holes about you.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.892
"Michael, Michael, Michael,
Klichael, Klichael, Klichael."

21:07.976 --> 21:09.852
Can I get a hug?
- No.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.230
High-five?
- Well...

21:13.815 --> 21:15.900
Janet, you can't make a person.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.527
I know. But I did though.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.696
Eleanor said that to forget about Jason...
- Oh. Hello.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.531
...I should create a rebound guy.
- I'm Derek.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.949
So, I made one. Derek!
- Hi.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.243
I'm her boyfriend and she made me.
- He's so nice.

21:25.326 --> 21:27.996
Whoa! Look at this glass.

21:28.079 --> 21:28.997
Oh, my God.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.165
I'm in there too?

21:31.499 --> 21:32.917
What's going on right now?

21:33.001 --> 21:35.962
It's my first time making someone,
so he might be a little bit "off."

21:36.045 --> 21:37.922
Look, this could be... Don't.
Please, put that down.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.549
This could be very dangerous.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.509
It... it shouldn't even be possible.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.052
Well, maybe not 800 reboots ago.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.804
But apparently, now it is.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.100
Can you believe this?

21:49.183 --> 21:51.352
Derek... is it "Derek"?
- It's Derek.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.272
Derek, could you please
give me and Janet a moment alone?

21:54.355 --> 21:55.940
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.191
OK, I'll miss you like crazy.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.861
I'll miss you more.
- No, I'll miss you more.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.405
I love you so much.
- I love you so much, babe! Come here!

22:02.488 --> 22:04.407
I will.
- Good, because I have something to give you.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.951
Oh, yeah? I have something to give you.
- What? What is it?

22:07.035 --> 22:09.787
Come here and I'll show you.
- OK, if I come over there, you'll show me?

22:09.871 --> 22:11.831
I promise.
- I'm going over.

22:11.914 --> 22:15.626
One, two, three, four, five, six steps
and here I am.

22:16.711 --> 22:17.587
It was a kiss.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.255
That's a kiss?
- Mm-hm.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.673
Loved it.
