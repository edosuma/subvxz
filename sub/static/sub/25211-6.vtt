00:40.506 --> 00:42.406
Craft a healing
potion for the boss crawl

00:42.441 --> 00:44.281
'cause the loot boxes
are weak sauce.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.280
Follow me.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.851
Leroy Jenkins!

00:47.880 --> 00:51.120
Right behind you.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.120
Townes.

00:52.151 --> 00:53.121
School.

00:53.152 --> 00:54.652
Yeah.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.374
I'm not doing so great
in Geometry.

01:10.402 --> 01:11.802
My last test I... no, crap.

01:11.837 --> 01:12.807
Orc on my six.

01:12.838 --> 01:14.208
Hold.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.110
Gotta switch
to my ranged dragon bow.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.543
Got him.

01:18.577 --> 01:20.777
If you need help
with your homework,

01:20.813 --> 01:22.183
call me.

01:22.214 --> 01:23.654
Really? That'd be great.

01:23.682 --> 01:25.522
Thanks.

01:25.551 --> 01:27.191
Townes, you're gonna be late.

01:27.219 --> 01:29.459
Yeah.

01:38.898 --> 01:42.268
You're still coming to my
science award ceremony, right?

01:42.301 --> 01:45.371
Yeah, I can't wait to see you.

01:45.404 --> 01:46.744
Remember, it starts at six.

01:46.772 --> 01:49.412
I emailed and messaged you
the address.

01:49.441 --> 01:50.581
I got it.

01:50.609 --> 01:52.309
Just so you know,

01:52.344 --> 01:54.184
in the picture I sent you
I have bangs,

01:54.213 --> 01:55.353
but they've grown out now,

01:55.381 --> 01:57.221
so I look different.

01:57.249 --> 01:59.419
Okay, then wear that
Naruto headband

01:59.451 --> 02:01.351
I sent you,
so I can recognize you.

02:01.387 --> 02:05.757
Cool, yeah, good idea.

02:05.791 --> 02:06.891
I love you.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.395
I love you too.

02:36.488 --> 02:39.528
Hey.

02:41.827 --> 02:44.567
We're here.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.471
I got you a breakfast burrito.

02:51.503 --> 02:53.773
Egg, cheese,

02:53.806 --> 02:55.446
and an obscene amount of mayo,

02:55.474 --> 02:56.844
as you like it.

02:56.875 --> 02:58.875
You stopped somewhere
and I didn't even notice?

02:58.911 --> 03:01.781
- You were out cold.
- Thanks.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.784
And thank you
for taking me home.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.786
Yeah, well, I was
in the neighborhood.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.659
So...

03:11.824 --> 03:15.824
What... what're you doing later?

03:15.861 --> 03:17.861
School.

03:17.896 --> 03:20.966
What are you doing?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.440
Well, traffic sucks right now,

03:23.469 --> 03:26.769
so I thought I'd wait it out
a couple of days.

03:26.805 --> 03:28.575
Just to be safe.

03:28.607 --> 03:29.747
Right.

03:32.611 --> 03:36.481
Plus, you owe me that story
about the old lady in Vermont.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.015
Right.

03:38.050 --> 03:41.290
I can find somewhere to crash.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.690
But only if you want me to.

03:44.723 --> 03:46.663
Okay.

03:48.794 --> 03:50.994
Can you pick me up after school?

03:51.030 --> 03:53.570
Yes, ma'am.

03:56.735 --> 04:00.905
- Get out of my car.
- Okay.

04:00.939 --> 04:03.579
Bye.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.644
I think I can make it
there around 5:30.

04:40.679 --> 04:42.349
- Okay, good.
- Come from work.

04:42.381 --> 04:43.681
Hi, honey.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.616
You feeling better?

04:49.421 --> 04:50.921
Yeah. Yes.

04:50.956 --> 04:53.426
Um, I still kind of
have a headache,

04:53.459 --> 04:55.529
but much better. Yeah.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.361
You know, breakfast actually
looks really good today.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.398
Yeah? Want pancakes?

05:00.432 --> 05:01.509
I can make you some pancakes?

05:01.533 --> 05:02.933
No, you don't have to do that.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.708
Can you pass me
the peanut butter, though?

05:04.737 --> 05:07.977
Henry, did you hear that
Jenna won first prize

05:08.006 --> 05:09.906
in the State Science Decathlon?

05:09.942 --> 05:11.742
Dad.

05:11.777 --> 05:13.417
What, can't be proud
of my own daughter?

05:13.445 --> 05:17.485
I didn't even know she was
in a state science thing.

05:17.516 --> 05:18.556
It's not a big deal.

05:18.584 --> 05:19.724
She's just nervous

05:19.752 --> 05:20.795
'cause she has
to accept the prize

05:20.819 --> 05:22.389
in front of the whole school.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.465
Yeah, it's a special
presentation

05:23.489 --> 05:24.859
before the big game tonight.

05:24.890 --> 05:26.860
Dad, Townes is accepting
the award, okay?

05:26.892 --> 05:29.092
Not me. It's... it's a team thing.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.598
Well, I think
it's very impressive.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.470
I never won anything
when I was in high school.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.809
We're all gonna be there
to support you.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.673
- Yeah.
- Right?

05:37.703 --> 05:41.403
Yeah, I'll be there.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.840
- So is it true?
- Shit if I know, dude.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.076
I mean, I should probably,
like, ask my mom.

05:46.111 --> 05:47.711
But what would I say?

05:47.746 --> 05:49.786
Hey, I woke up in a home

05:49.815 --> 05:51.955
that we used to live in
from before I can remember,

05:51.984 --> 05:53.454
met some old lady,

05:53.485 --> 05:55.655
and she told me Dad
was fucking nuts.

05:55.687 --> 05:57.757
True or false?

05:57.790 --> 06:00.430
Yeah, that does...
That does sound bad.

06:00.459 --> 06:01.759
But...

06:01.794 --> 06:04.164
what if you and he both...

06:04.196 --> 06:05.536
You know...

06:05.564 --> 06:07.504
Well, we'd make
the perfect pair.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.803
Traveling schizophrenic dad
and seizure daughter.

06:10.836 --> 06:12.976
You could have a sitcom.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.105
The game you've all been
waiting for is tonight,

06:15.140 --> 06:17.110
against our rivals,
Lincoln High.

06:17.142 --> 06:18.912
Come support our Warriors.

06:18.944 --> 06:20.444
The game starts at 5:00.

06:20.479 --> 06:22.619
So, is your boyfriend
still in town?

06:22.648 --> 06:23.988
He's not my boyfriend.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.886
But I thought...

06:25.918 --> 06:27.618
Did it end badly or something?

06:27.653 --> 06:29.953
No, things didn't really end.

06:29.988 --> 06:33.558
They just...

06:33.592 --> 06:35.692
It's a long story.

06:35.727 --> 06:39.197
Anyway, he's here now, so I'll see if I
can get him to come to your ceremony.

06:39.231 --> 06:42.631
Yeah...

06:42.668 --> 06:44.538
I don't... I don't think you
should come.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.740
No, I want to.

06:45.771 --> 06:47.081
I mean,
it's like important to you.

06:47.105 --> 06:50.975
Clay's gonna be honored
at the game.

06:51.009 --> 06:52.579
I wanted to tell you before,

06:52.611 --> 06:56.011
but I... I think
it's gonna be a big thing.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.148
It's gross, I know.

06:58.183 --> 06:59.923
If people knew what
he was really like,

06:59.952 --> 07:01.463
then they wouldn't
be treating him like he was

07:01.487 --> 07:02.517
some sort of God.

07:02.554 --> 07:05.054
Yeah, it's fine.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.730
I can handle it.

07:06.758 --> 07:07.958
Are you sure?

07:07.993 --> 07:09.563
Hey, Jenna.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.465
Hi.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.541
I was wondering, if you're
gonna be around after the game,

07:13.565 --> 07:14.676
I figured maybe
we could hang out

07:14.700 --> 07:15.743
and watch a movie or something?

07:15.767 --> 07:18.137
Yeah, okay, that'd be cool.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.910
Cool.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.881
What was that about?

07:28.914 --> 07:31.214
We're just...
We're just hanging out.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.850
Since when?

07:32.885 --> 07:35.685
He's not like
the other guys on the team.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.161
Yeah, I know.

07:37.189 --> 07:38.259
He seems really nice.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.190
I was just saying,

07:40.225 --> 07:44.065
like, be careful.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.766
I should get to class.

09:09.781 --> 09:11.951
Fuck, God damn it.

10:22.988 --> 10:24.858
Mrs. Miller.

10:24.890 --> 10:28.060
His service was this morning.

10:29.728 --> 10:33.268
We received a bag of Amos'
effects with his body,

10:33.298 --> 10:35.398
but his Bible is missing.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.904
I see.

10:37.936 --> 10:39.976
Well, we gave you
everything that we had.

10:40.005 --> 10:41.905
Everything he had on him
when he was brought in.

10:41.940 --> 10:42.980
But he

10:43.008 --> 10:44.378
always carried it with him.

10:44.409 --> 10:46.179
Always.

10:46.211 --> 10:48.681
Well, I can check
with the medical examiner,

10:48.714 --> 10:50.224
and make sure that
it wasn't misplaced.

10:50.248 --> 10:53.848
Look, it was stolen.

10:53.885 --> 10:55.285
How do you know that?

10:55.320 --> 10:58.820
If it wasn't with him,
it was stolen.

10:58.857 --> 11:01.057
Do you understand?

11:01.093 --> 11:03.433
Okay.

11:03.462 --> 11:06.262
Okay, um...

11:06.298 --> 11:07.868
Can you tell me
what it looked like?

11:07.899 --> 11:09.839
It's, a pocket Bible.

11:09.868 --> 11:13.238
Brown with Amos' name

11:13.271 --> 11:15.211
on the front.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.940
It was a gift from
his father and myself

11:17.976 --> 11:20.976
on his 16th birthday.

11:23.181 --> 11:26.781
Please, help me find it.

11:26.818 --> 11:29.118
Please.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.250
Hi, Randy, this is Anna Hulce.

11:58.283 --> 12:01.753
Um, my car is
giving me some trouble.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.087
Can I get a tow?

12:12.798 --> 12:16.298
You wanna grab something to eat?

12:24.442 --> 12:27.842
What are you doing?

12:27.879 --> 12:31.079
If something's wrong,
you can tell me.

12:33.251 --> 12:34.328
Ever since I picked you up,

12:34.352 --> 12:36.922
you just...

12:40.525 --> 12:44.425
What's going on?

12:58.910 --> 12:59.950
Henry.

12:59.978 --> 13:02.018
Just shut up, please.

13:29.174 --> 13:30.444
You okay?

13:30.475 --> 13:34.175
- Henry.
- Yeah.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.188
I'm being serious. Hey!

13:38.216 --> 13:40.286
- That hurts... hey.
- Henry... calm.

13:45.023 --> 13:46.423
You okay?

13:46.458 --> 13:48.898
Fuck.

13:58.136 --> 13:59.106
Did I do something wrong?

13:59.137 --> 14:01.207
No, no, no. No.

14:01.239 --> 14:03.609
Just need some air.

14:06.244 --> 14:07.344
Sorry.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.249
No, no, don't be.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.322
It's okay.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.401
I, um...

14:25.430 --> 14:28.370
I found this cool place
I wanna show you.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.873
I think you'll like it.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.207
Trust me.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.581
If you're not into it,

14:41.613 --> 14:45.113
I'll... I'll give you a ride home.

14:47.519 --> 14:51.489
Whatever you want.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.299
Okay.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.368
Okay.

14:59.397 --> 15:02.667
I got a buddy on the force
over in Mississauga County.

15:02.701 --> 15:07.041
Says he just came across his third
fentanyl overdose of the week.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.212
Mississauga?

15:09.240 --> 15:11.140
We don't have anybody
over there.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.946
Where'd they get their product?

15:12.978 --> 15:15.578
Emlen.

15:15.613 --> 15:19.053
Pills have
Jeremiah's stamp on them.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.584
That son of a bitch.

15:20.618 --> 15:23.958
Why would Jeremiah take up
with a new distributor

15:23.989 --> 15:25.389
so close to home?

15:25.423 --> 15:27.463
'Cause he's a lying
sack of shit, that's why.

15:27.492 --> 15:29.262
Pious fuck.

15:29.294 --> 15:32.034
And to think I helped him
get his son's body back.

15:33.431 --> 15:36.671
Well, he's not forcing me out
without a fight.

15:38.169 --> 15:40.139
Fuck.

15:49.147 --> 15:50.417
I saw you being towed in.

15:50.448 --> 15:51.718
Time for a new car?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.020
Not on a deputy's salary.

15:54.052 --> 15:56.092
I think it's just the starter.
Nothing fatal.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.165
I'm sorry that you and Henry
never got a chance to talk.

15:58.189 --> 15:59.667
I called the office,
but the Sheriff said that.

15:59.691 --> 16:02.631
Clay's case was close,
and so I...

16:02.660 --> 16:04.400
Right. Yeah.

16:04.429 --> 16:06.429
How is she doing? Henry.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.564
She's good, I think.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.100
She's not the most open.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.375
She's a typical teenager.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.449
Well, I suppose when she gets settled and
makes a few friends thing will get better.

16:15.473 --> 16:18.013
I mean, at least that's
what I keep telling myself.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.443
This town is not
the most inviting.

16:20.478 --> 16:21.718
Yeah.

16:21.746 --> 16:24.116
Hey, I don't suppose
that you would wanna

16:24.149 --> 16:27.119
get a drink some time
just to hang out, or...

16:27.152 --> 16:28.652
Um,

16:28.686 --> 16:31.086
yeah, I would
actually love that.

16:31.122 --> 16:32.562
Well, I'm off tonight.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.660
- Is... is that...
- Well, then tonight it is.

16:34.692 --> 16:37.162
I just have to go to the Reston
High game, but I'm free after.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.572
Yeah, I think that
could totally work.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.366
Do you wanna say 8:00
at the Split Pin?

16:40.398 --> 16:41.738
Yeah, perfect.

16:41.766 --> 16:42.736
Looking forward to that.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.107
Yeah, me too.

16:44.135 --> 16:46.275
Right, I'll see you tonight.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.432
No.

19:26.898 --> 19:30.398
You still do that?

19:30.435 --> 19:32.235
Don't judge me.

19:32.270 --> 19:36.410
And you put pineapple
in a tuna sub, okay?

19:36.441 --> 19:39.341
Fucking psycho.

19:39.377 --> 19:42.847
It's a mouth vacation
in the Caribbean, all right?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.620
You can smell the ocean breeze.

19:44.649 --> 19:46.819
Smell the palm trees.

19:46.851 --> 19:49.521
Someone somewhere is
playing a steel drum.

19:49.554 --> 19:52.954
That is the saddest

19:52.991 --> 19:55.591
and most insulting

19:55.627 --> 19:58.727
mouth vacation I have
ever heard about.

19:58.763 --> 20:00.863
So...

20:00.898 --> 20:03.668
Vermont.

20:03.701 --> 20:05.671
Come on, what's the deal?

20:05.703 --> 20:09.343
I used to live there
when I was little.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.984
Before my dad left.

20:14.012 --> 20:18.252
Are you trying to find him?

20:20.051 --> 20:22.291
I don't know.

20:24.889 --> 20:29.329
Does your dad
know where you are?

20:29.360 --> 20:30.400
No.

20:31.729 --> 20:33.899
No, his memory's
a bit suspect these days.

20:33.931 --> 20:37.571
I don't know if it's
the whisky or the TV.

20:37.602 --> 20:38.872
Definitely the TV.

20:44.776 --> 20:48.816
Past couple of months I've been
looking online for a job.

20:50.481 --> 20:52.921
Found a bunch of welding gigs

20:52.950 --> 20:54.020
in Montana.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.892
Montana.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.561
Like, cowboys and shit?

20:59.590 --> 21:02.030
Yeah.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.030
There's a...

21:04.062 --> 21:08.402
A natural gas boom there.

21:08.433 --> 21:13.303
And there's this gig in this
little town called Livingston.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.308
It's by the Yellowstone River.

21:15.340 --> 21:19.610
And it's surrounded
by mountains and

21:19.644 --> 21:22.944
pink sunsets.

21:22.980 --> 21:26.320
You can go snowboarding
in the winter.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.891
You can go fly fishing
in the summer.

21:28.920 --> 21:33.660
I figure I can work mornings
and the nights will be mine.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.369
Livingston.

21:40.398 --> 21:43.338
That sounds nice.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.538
Think I wanna build my own home.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.780
Do you know how to build a home?

21:46.804 --> 21:48.704
No.

21:48.740 --> 21:52.680
- Do you know anyone there?
- No.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.750
That's kind of the point.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.822
How long till your mom

21:59.851 --> 22:00.951
gets tired of this place

22:00.985 --> 22:03.725
and drags you out of here?

22:07.825 --> 22:11.795
I think she actually
likes it here.

22:11.829 --> 22:14.099
Maybe this time
will be different.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.103
Come on.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.005
You don't believe that.

22:23.641 --> 22:24.841
She's trying.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.046
They always try.

22:27.078 --> 22:29.518
Do you like it here?

22:37.855 --> 22:39.025
Fuck.

22:39.056 --> 22:42.096
Do you know what time it is?

22:45.096 --> 22:46.896
Five.

22:46.931 --> 22:49.901
Can you give me
a ride somewhere?

22:49.934 --> 22:51.874
Like, now.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.943
Let's go!

22:58.776 --> 23:00.776
Go Warriors!

23:00.812 --> 23:02.882
There it is. Nice.

23:06.484 --> 23:08.854
Sorry.

23:29.974 --> 23:32.614
Go Warriors!

23:36.013 --> 23:37.213
Jenna.

23:37.248 --> 23:39.018
Jenna!

23:39.050 --> 23:40.080
Good luck.

23:40.117 --> 23:42.657
Break a leg.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.459
Fit the whole town in here?

23:50.495 --> 23:52.765
Go Warriors!

23:54.799 --> 23:56.769
Who's the guy Henry's with?

23:56.801 --> 23:58.571
I think that's...

23:58.603 --> 24:00.143
- Is that Josh?
- Who's Josh?

24:00.171 --> 24:02.711
It's her boyfriend
before we moved here.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.540
Which means she wasn't sick
last night.

24:05.576 --> 24:07.616
Good evening.

24:07.645 --> 24:10.215
Welcome to Reston High.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.988
Now, I know you're all ready
to cheer on the Warriors,

24:13.017 --> 24:14.917
but before tip-off,

24:14.952 --> 24:17.752
I am so proud to present
the Science Club...

24:17.788 --> 24:19.658
Do you know where Townes is?

24:19.690 --> 24:22.890
First place trophy from
the State Science Decathlon.

24:22.927 --> 24:24.227
Now, team, stand up.

24:31.035 --> 24:32.875
And to accept the award

24:32.904 --> 24:35.574
is the Science Club
team captain,

24:35.606 --> 24:37.776
Townes Linderman.

24:44.582 --> 24:47.922
Mr. Linderman.

24:47.952 --> 24:50.522
Mr. Linderman?

24:53.190 --> 24:55.190
Mr. Linderman.

25:01.098 --> 25:02.738
I can take it.

25:02.767 --> 25:05.267
Okay.

25:08.606 --> 25:11.776
All right, let's have another
hand for the Science Club.

25:11.809 --> 25:14.079
Whoo-hoo!

25:14.111 --> 25:16.951
That was weird.

25:35.933 --> 25:38.303
Let's get out of here.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.786
Can you give me a minute?

25:56.821 --> 25:59.121
Yeah, sure.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.329
Hey.

26:07.365 --> 26:10.205
Are you okay?

26:10.234 --> 26:12.112
Look, Townes, I know you don't
really wanna tal...

26:12.136 --> 26:14.876
She didn't show up.

26:14.905 --> 26:18.305
She said she would,
but she didn't show up.

26:18.342 --> 26:20.082
Who?

26:20.111 --> 26:21.851
My girlfriend.

26:25.082 --> 26:27.152
People shouldn't lie.

26:27.184 --> 26:29.154
Why did she lie to me?

26:29.186 --> 26:32.086
I don't know.

26:32.123 --> 26:35.693
People do a lot of, just,
really stupid shit.

26:41.699 --> 26:44.339
I mean, not everybody
is like you, Townes.

26:44.368 --> 26:47.868
You aren't afraid to be honest.

26:47.905 --> 26:50.205
You say what you think
no matter what.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.811
But most people aren't
like that.

26:52.843 --> 26:54.683
So maybe she didn't lie,
you know?

26:54.712 --> 26:56.189
Maybe there's just something
going on with her

26:56.213 --> 26:58.783
and she can't...

26:58.816 --> 27:02.716
She can't tell you
about it right now.

27:02.753 --> 27:05.153
Zoe.

27:05.189 --> 27:07.829
My girlfriend's name is Zoe.

27:07.858 --> 27:10.328
Well, maybe call Zoe out
on her shit.

27:10.361 --> 27:12.861
And see what's up.

27:12.897 --> 27:14.374
And if you think
that she deserves it,

27:14.398 --> 27:17.138
then give her a second chance.

27:17.168 --> 27:21.808
And if not, then tell me and
I will kick her fucking ass.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.778
Okay?

27:29.380 --> 27:32.080
I got the message you left me.

27:32.116 --> 27:34.986
If you still need my help,
I'm around.

27:37.188 --> 27:40.158
Thanks.

27:48.899 --> 27:51.839
So, what do you wanna do?

27:51.869 --> 27:53.709
So what do you think?

27:53.738 --> 27:54.978
- What?
- Is the water too warm?

27:58.375 --> 28:02.745
This motel is so fucking weird.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.720
It's got character.

28:04.749 --> 28:07.719
My God, what's happening?

28:07.752 --> 28:09.892
What's happening?

28:12.923 --> 28:14.993
"And then,

28:15.025 --> 28:17.395
"when the molly hits me,
I just wanna

28:17.428 --> 28:20.368
"hop in the leaves, and just,

28:20.397 --> 28:24.167
play, play, play!"

28:28.272 --> 28:30.372
No, that wasn't...

28:36.447 --> 28:38.417
Do you still do that stuff?

28:38.449 --> 28:39.949
Like, to party, or...

28:39.984 --> 28:43.454
No.

28:43.487 --> 28:45.157
I,

28:45.189 --> 28:48.289
Had a close call
a couple of months ago, so...

28:48.325 --> 28:51.395
But I'm clean now.

28:51.428 --> 28:53.428
I mean it.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.770
I missed the shit out of you.

29:02.106 --> 29:06.916
When you left, I...

29:06.944 --> 29:11.354
I just...

29:11.382 --> 29:14.222
Fuck.

29:14.251 --> 29:17.221
You know?

30:35.266 --> 30:37.066
Come on, boys. Hey, double up.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.501
Double up. Come on, boys.

30:39.536 --> 30:41.606
Come on.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.579
Fucking Munther.

30:43.607 --> 30:45.147
You would've made that one, boy.

30:49.046 --> 30:50.516
Ladies and gentlemen.

30:50.547 --> 30:52.187
It's now that time.

30:52.216 --> 30:54.086
If you will, please
put your hands together

30:54.118 --> 30:56.618
and welcome our friend,
our captain,

30:56.654 --> 30:58.024
Clay Boone.

30:58.055 --> 30:59.625
Good job, man.

31:05.329 --> 31:08.129
Yeah! Yeah.

31:11.235 --> 31:13.105
Thank you.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.906
Nice.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.281
To show our thanks tonight,

31:18.309 --> 31:20.179
we honor you, Clay,

31:20.210 --> 31:22.680
and we thank you for your years

31:22.713 --> 31:24.683
as our captain.

31:24.715 --> 31:28.155
So tonight, in your honor,
we're retiring your jersey.

31:28.185 --> 31:32.055
No one will ever wear
the number 32 again.

31:43.133 --> 31:46.073
Three, two, one.

33:04.448 --> 33:07.318
How does it feel?

33:07.351 --> 33:08.351
What do you mean?

33:09.420 --> 33:10.497
They can't win without you,

33:10.521 --> 33:14.261
it must feel pretty good.

33:14.291 --> 33:17.331
It doesn't.

33:19.463 --> 33:21.363
Hey, Patty.

33:21.398 --> 33:24.338
Um...

33:24.368 --> 33:28.408
Listen, I was a real dick
last time I saw you.

33:29.506 --> 33:31.046
I'm sorry.

33:31.075 --> 33:32.715
I just...

33:35.345 --> 33:38.285
I'm sorry.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.620
You know,

33:42.653 --> 33:46.823
you're still Clay Boone.

33:46.857 --> 33:51.097
Nothing can take that away.

33:54.431 --> 33:57.331
So we were both stationed
at Fort Bragg,

33:57.367 --> 34:00.167
and he was about to be deployed,

34:00.204 --> 34:03.574
and I don't know, I mean,

34:03.607 --> 34:05.477
it seemed like a good
idea at the time.

34:05.509 --> 34:06.779
How old were you?

34:06.810 --> 34:09.110
- Twenty.
- Wow, that's so young.

34:09.146 --> 34:10.516
That's...

34:10.547 --> 34:12.092
That's only four years
older than Henry.

34:12.116 --> 34:13.246
I know.

34:13.283 --> 34:15.783
Kind of seems
like a lifetime ago.

34:15.819 --> 34:17.418
But, it's... I mean,
it's all good.

34:17.454 --> 34:18.554
We're still friends.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.389
Sometimes even
more than friends.

34:20.424 --> 34:22.469
Well, you know what they say,
ex sex is the best sex.

34:22.493 --> 34:23.862
Do people say that?

34:23.893 --> 34:26.134
I don't know. Probably not.

34:26.163 --> 34:27.402
What about you?

34:27.431 --> 34:29.571
How old were you
when you got married?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.770
I was 27.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.473
And I thought, "This is it."

34:34.505 --> 34:36.705
This is the person
I'll be with forever."

34:36.739 --> 34:39.139
I know, divorce is a bitch.

34:39.176 --> 34:42.746
Technically we're still married.

34:44.481 --> 34:45.851
He ran off.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.853
And I didn't know
where to find him.

34:48.886 --> 34:51.485
I guess there's

34:51.522 --> 34:54.322
things that I could do,
but, you know...

34:56.627 --> 34:58.467
I'm sorry.

34:58.495 --> 35:00.865
Yeah, me too.

35:00.898 --> 35:02.138
Do we need more drinks?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.506
Absolutely.

35:03.534 --> 35:05.134
- I'm just gonna go pee first.
- Okay.

35:05.169 --> 35:06.669
I'll be right back.

35:06.703 --> 35:07.843
All right.

35:09.873 --> 35:11.673
Can we get another round?

35:11.708 --> 35:13.778
Sure, one Jameson on the rocks

35:13.810 --> 35:16.380
and, was it a vodka soda?

35:16.413 --> 35:18.383
Soda water with lime,

35:18.415 --> 35:19.615
but in a low ball glass.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.850
- You got it.
- Okay.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.526
- This one?
- Yeah.

35:42.406 --> 35:43.376
Um,

35:43.407 --> 35:45.347
did you want a beer?

36:00.257 --> 36:02.497
You know you don't have to
drink it if you don't like it.

36:06.797 --> 36:10.567
This is a cool room.

36:10.601 --> 36:12.271
Is that your grandma?

36:12.302 --> 36:15.602
What?

36:15.639 --> 36:19.309
That's actually Marie Curie.

36:20.644 --> 36:23.414
That's that scientist lady,
right?

36:35.025 --> 36:37.695
Did you wanna watch a movie?

36:37.728 --> 36:39.368
Yeah, sure.

37:00.817 --> 37:04.257
I know something's wrong,

37:04.288 --> 37:08.458
but you don't have
to tell me what it is, okay?

37:18.368 --> 37:22.278
It's just really hard for me
to be in this town sometimes.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.878
So come with me.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.950
Come to Montana.

37:35.686 --> 37:39.656
How many times have we talked
about getting away,

37:39.690 --> 37:43.030
escaping?

37:43.060 --> 37:45.460
You don't have to eat
some fucking sandwich

37:45.495 --> 37:50.035
just to pretend we're
somewhere we're not.

37:50.067 --> 37:53.467
We could just go there.

38:00.077 --> 38:04.047
Don't let your mom's
shit trap you here, Henry.

38:12.055 --> 38:16.025
Josh.

38:19.529 --> 38:22.869
If I run away
then I'm just like her.

38:22.899 --> 38:25.839
You know?

38:25.869 --> 38:29.839
And shit always catches up.

38:37.647 --> 38:39.117
I... I can't.

38:39.149 --> 38:42.119
I can't, I'm sorry.

38:44.454 --> 38:48.424
I'm sorry.

39:00.170 --> 39:01.470
Shit.

39:02.672 --> 39:03.642
What?

39:03.673 --> 39:04.673
That baby had demon eyes.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.079
God.

39:11.448 --> 39:12.818
You have a really pretty smile.

39:12.849 --> 39:14.849
Alice is mine.

39:15.919 --> 39:18.619
Okay, well...

39:23.427 --> 39:25.097
Is that okay? I should've asked.

39:25.128 --> 39:26.928
There is no God.

39:35.472 --> 39:38.472
You have your father's eyes.

39:38.508 --> 39:40.778
And they were always deep...

39:40.811 --> 39:44.911
My dad won't be back
for a while.

40:28.124 --> 40:30.224
Are you sure you wanna do this?

40:30.260 --> 40:32.200
Yeah.

41:00.156 --> 41:03.126
I've never actually
done this before, but...

41:03.159 --> 41:05.759
It's okay.

41:05.795 --> 41:08.265
Me neither.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.074
Okay.

41:29.152 --> 41:31.192
This was so fun.

41:31.221 --> 41:32.861
And to think this never
would've happened

41:32.889 --> 41:34.166
if you hadn't caught
Henry tagging.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.160
Well, then here's to Henry.

41:36.192 --> 41:38.162
To Henry.
May she stay out of jail.

41:40.797 --> 41:43.137
You should give yourself
a little bit more credit.

41:43.166 --> 41:44.166
You're a good mom.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.570
I don't know.

41:45.602 --> 41:47.642
No, seriously,
in my line of work

41:47.671 --> 41:49.211
I see all kinds.

41:49.239 --> 41:52.009
You actually give a shit what
happens to your kid, so

41:52.042 --> 41:53.982
even if Henry doesn't
appreciate it now,

41:54.010 --> 41:56.850
someday she will.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.850
Thank you.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.625
Shit.

42:07.657 --> 42:10.657
I've left my house keys on
my car keys at Boone Motors.

42:10.694 --> 42:11.824
I can let you in.

42:11.861 --> 42:13.261
Really, you wouldn't mind?

42:13.296 --> 42:15.196
Of course not.
Come on, let's share a cab.

42:15.231 --> 42:17.301
That's great, thank you.

42:22.839 --> 42:24.739
This was really nice.

42:28.678 --> 42:31.718
Did I, well,

42:31.748 --> 42:33.348
did you feel good?

42:36.086 --> 42:38.856
Um, I guess I'll text you later.

42:53.903 --> 42:57.073
Please, don't worry.
So... do you mind shutting that?

42:57.107 --> 42:58.977
Sure.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.949
I really am sorry about this.

43:00.977 --> 43:02.247
Honestly, it's no trouble.

43:02.278 --> 43:03.848
I'll just go get your keys,
okay?

43:03.880 --> 43:04.924
- Okay.
- You wanna wait here?

43:04.948 --> 43:06.788
Sure.

43:21.731 --> 43:23.201
What did your keychain look...

43:23.233 --> 43:26.003
What're you doing?

43:26.036 --> 43:28.106
I...

43:28.138 --> 43:30.208
Look.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.917
There are things going on
here with Bill Boone.

43:31.941 --> 43:33.252
Things that... that you
don't know about.

43:33.276 --> 43:34.746
So this whole thing tonight,

43:34.778 --> 43:37.218
you just... you used me?

43:37.247 --> 43:38.647
I know it looks bad, I just...

43:38.682 --> 43:40.152
I needed to find...

43:40.183 --> 43:42.223
I could get fired for this.
Do you understand?

43:42.252 --> 43:43.752
This job is everything to me.

43:43.787 --> 43:45.097
It pays for my
daughter's medication.

43:45.121 --> 43:46.232
Cleo, please,
if you just let me...

43:46.256 --> 43:48.856
Just leave.

43:48.892 --> 43:52.762
Now.

43:52.796 --> 43:55.766
I'm sorry.

44:32.202 --> 44:36.242
Are you there?

44:37.874 --> 44:41.714
I'm here.

44:41.745 --> 44:45.485
I know the award
meant a lot to you.

44:45.515 --> 44:47.455
I get a lot of awards.

44:47.484 --> 44:51.724
I'm sorry I didn't show.

44:53.022 --> 44:54.492
Why?

44:54.524 --> 44:56.824
I just got busy.

44:56.860 --> 45:00.330
With family and stuff.

45:00.363 --> 45:03.163
If that were true,
you wouldn't be sorry now,

45:03.199 --> 45:05.869
and you would've texted me
to let me know.

45:05.902 --> 45:08.042
You're right. I got scared.

45:08.071 --> 45:10.041
I thought when you saw me
in real life

45:10.073 --> 45:11.373
you wouldn't want me.

45:11.407 --> 45:14.407
You underestimate me.

45:14.444 --> 45:16.444
Boys are boys.

45:16.479 --> 45:20.719
I don't know what that means
but it sounds stupid.

45:22.152 --> 45:25.422
Do you think I'm attracted
to you for your face

45:25.455 --> 45:26.995
or the fact that you can slay

45:27.023 --> 45:28.863
an entire room of winged orcs

45:28.892 --> 45:33.932
slave-minded to a heavy crystal
overlord, single-handed?

45:35.465 --> 45:39.805
I don't care what
you look like IRL.

45:39.836 --> 45:41.906
Hey, you're nearly
at the Sky Castle.

45:41.938 --> 45:43.778
Yeah, I am.

45:43.807 --> 45:45.547
Collect more ammo,
and meet me there.

45:45.575 --> 45:47.515
Okay.

46:00.390 --> 46:03.090
Henrietta.

46:03.126 --> 46:05.966
You here to see Clay?

46:05.995 --> 46:09.065
Hey, did you catch the game?

46:09.098 --> 46:10.168
Some of it.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.170
We lost.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.242
I mean, without Clay, you know.

46:15.271 --> 46:19.311
Door's open. He's in his room.

46:51.941 --> 46:54.881
Hey, this is a surprise.

46:58.414 --> 47:02.584
What're you doing here?

47:02.619 --> 47:04.219
Do you want a beer or something?

47:04.254 --> 47:06.054
I think we have
some in the fridge.

47:06.089 --> 47:08.289
No.

47:08.324 --> 47:11.364
What's wrong?

47:13.563 --> 47:16.063
I wanna talk about the accident.

47:16.099 --> 47:19.469
Okay.

47:19.502 --> 47:22.972
In your truck

47:23.006 --> 47:27.176
we started to kiss.

47:27.210 --> 47:30.280
And I told you no.

47:30.313 --> 47:34.953
I told you to stop
and you didn't stop.

47:34.984 --> 47:36.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what're you talking about?

47:36.352 --> 47:38.022
I didn't wanna do anything,

47:38.054 --> 47:39.524
but you held me down.

47:39.555 --> 47:40.525
Henry, this is crazy.

47:40.556 --> 47:42.026
And you...

47:42.058 --> 47:45.398
You forced your fingers
inside me.

47:45.428 --> 47:46.628
Okay, stop.

47:46.663 --> 47:47.633
Stop, I didn't do any of that.

47:47.664 --> 47:49.034
You did.

47:49.065 --> 47:50.235
And I didn't want that.

47:50.266 --> 47:52.206
You kissed me.

47:52.235 --> 47:53.975
You fucking kissed me.
Do you remember that?

47:54.003 --> 47:55.173
Of course I remember.

47:55.204 --> 47:56.644
Do you remember
moving towards me?

47:56.673 --> 47:57.683
- Yes, I remember.
- Kissing me?

47:57.707 --> 47:59.407
You wanted... you wanted it.

47:59.442 --> 48:00.452
I kissed you but that doesn't
mean I wanted it.

48:00.476 --> 48:01.446
Why are you saying this then?

48:01.477 --> 48:02.977
You hurt me!

48:03.012 --> 48:04.352
You hurt me.

48:04.380 --> 48:06.550
I told you I wanted
to go home, Clay.

48:06.582 --> 48:08.122
I wanted to go home
and you hurt me.

48:08.151 --> 48:09.451
- I hurt you?
- Yes.

48:09.485 --> 48:11.225
I fucking hurt you?

48:11.254 --> 48:14.154
Are you kidding me?

48:14.190 --> 48:15.630
Look at me, Henry.

48:15.658 --> 48:17.369
I'm the one in this chair.
I'm the one who got hurt.

48:17.393 --> 48:19.033
I didn't do shit to you.

48:19.062 --> 48:23.402
Clay, there was no accident.

48:23.433 --> 48:25.133
There was no accident.

48:25.168 --> 48:28.308
There was no attack.
No Mennonites.

48:28.338 --> 48:29.678
I did this to you.

48:29.706 --> 48:30.946
You're a fucking liar.

48:30.974 --> 48:33.514
I did this, and I am glad.

48:33.543 --> 48:37.953
I am glad you are stuck in this
chair for the rest of your life.

48:37.981 --> 48:41.081
I am glad that you
will never walk again

48:41.117 --> 48:44.157
because now you can
never hurt anyone else.

48:44.187 --> 48:46.627
Never.

48:46.656 --> 48:48.567
There's something seriously
fucking wrong with you.

48:48.591 --> 48:50.091
- You know that?
- I'm so glad!

48:50.126 --> 48:52.096
- Get the fuck out!
- So glad.

48:52.128 --> 48:55.568
Get the fuck out of my house!

49:22.592 --> 49:24.603
- We really shouldn't.
- I just wanna make you feel good.

49:24.627 --> 49:26.997
- I know, but, Clay...
- Henry, Henry, Henry.

49:27.030 --> 49:30.300
Clay.

49:33.503 --> 49:36.473
See?
