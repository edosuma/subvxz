WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.903
This is your objective...
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.936 --> 00:05.639
Demon class Polgara species.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.342
MAN:
Bone skewers jut
from the creature's

00:08.375 --> 00:10.510
forearms during battle.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.214
It's imperative not
to damage its arms.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.648
Why exactly can't we damage
this poker thing's arms?

00:15.682 --> 00:16.850
She's an unnecessary risk.

00:16.884 --> 00:17.984
Two of our hostiles broke free

00:18.018 --> 00:22.323
and escaped into the tunnels.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.324
She's dead, Riley.
I don't understand.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.327
Professor Walsh, if you think
that's enough to kill me,

00:26.359 --> 00:29.097
you really don't know
what a slayer is.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.998
She wants a fight,
we'll give her one.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.865
It's not safe for any of us.

00:32.899 --> 00:34.167
And when she least expects it...
(yells)

00:34.201 --> 00:35.503
Adam!

00:35.536 --> 00:38.037
Mommy.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.040
So Maggie sends me
down into the sewers

00:41.075 --> 00:42.576
with one of
those blasto-guns,

00:42.609 --> 00:45.112
and the next thing I know,
it's raining monsters.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.781
Hallelujah.
And then this gate
slams down behind me,

00:48.816 --> 00:51.118
and I try to use the gun,
but it goes pfft.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.552
GILES:
You're saying that Maggie Walsh

00:52.585 --> 00:54.088
set you up?

00:54.121 --> 00:56.124
That's exactly what I'm saying.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.957
She sent me
on a one-way recon.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.560
SPIKE:
Got to hand it to you,

00:59.593 --> 01:00.960
Goldilocks.

01:00.993 --> 01:03.063
You do have bleeding
tragic taste

01:03.097 --> 01:04.364
in men.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.766
I got a cousin married

01:05.799 --> 01:07.567
to a regurgitating
Frolopse's demon

01:07.600 --> 01:09.602
that's got better instincts
than you.
What does

01:09.637 --> 01:11.371
my taste in men
have to do with this?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.206
SPIKE:
You think Riley was
out knitting booties

01:13.240 --> 01:15.742
for your future offspring while
Maggie was stringing you up?

01:21.314 --> 01:23.751
You guys think Riley had
something to do with this?

01:23.783 --> 01:27.587
Probably not, but, um...
we'd be remiss

01:27.620 --> 01:31.459
if we didn't think
of all the possibilities.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.262
Right.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.728
Remiss.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.265
No.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.932
No. Maggie made sure

01:38.966 --> 01:40.567
that he was nowhere around
when she sent me

01:40.600 --> 01:42.902
on this very special
"Make Buffy Dead" assignment.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.572
Plus... Riley?

01:44.604 --> 01:47.073
He seems like he wouldn't
tell a little white lie,

01:47.106 --> 01:50.578
let alone a whole bunch
of big dirty ones.
XANDER: That's why

01:50.610 --> 01:52.313
they call it
the secr forces, Will.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.647
'Cause they kind of keep the
whole lying thing to themselves.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.485
All I know is that
Maggie has it in for me,

01:58.519 --> 02:00.987
which means the Initiative
has it in for me.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.423
And I'm guessing
the mad scientist

02:02.456 --> 02:04.492
isn't too keen on the fact
that the entire

02:04.525 --> 02:06.493
Scooby gang knows that the
Initiative is up to no good.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.995
BUFFY:
Which brings us back

02:08.026 --> 02:10.963
to the "not safe for any of us"
concept.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.332
What could have happened

02:12.365 --> 02:13.634
to make Professor Walsh
want to kill you?

02:13.667 --> 02:16.870
I don't know.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.608
She wasn't keen on the fact that
I was asking a lot of questions,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.475
that's for sure.
ANYA:
So you were

02:22.509 --> 02:24.277
getting too close
to something.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.114
Clearly. Although,
one can only imagine

02:27.146 --> 02:30.116
what she'd be so desperate
to hide.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.120
(insects trilling)

02:33.152 --> 02:36.257
(loud whooshing)

02:50.170 --> 02:53.240
(wolf howling)

02:53.274 --> 02:55.543
*

03:43.390 --> 03:45.925
Okay, everybody grab a weapon.
We've got to move.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.527
XANDER:
And storm the Initiative?

03:47.561 --> 03:50.264
Yeah. Let's take on
those suckers.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.764
I was thinking more
that we'd hide.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.933
Oh, thank God.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.103
Buffy, I think perhaps
we should talk about this.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.472
We need to relocate someplace
we're less likely to be found.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.407
We need to come up
with a plan.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.875
We could go to my place.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.644
The Initiative guys
know how close we are.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.445
They'll automatically check
the places that you hang out.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.046
Xander, what about
your basement?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.782
The guys haven't seen us
together that much,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.217
and there's enough room.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.385
Ooh, plus, mirror ball.
XANDER:
Cool.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.421
Come on down and boogie
at Xander's hideaway.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.223
Yes. Come boogie.
GILES:
Absolutely not.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.625
I will not squat
in that dank hole.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.060
SPIKE:
What, it was

04:20.093 --> 04:21.961
good enough for me,
but you're above it all?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.930
Precisely.

04:23.963 --> 04:26.733
Besides, I-I don't see why we
can't stay right where we are.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.136
(laughing):
It's very unlikely
those Initiative boys

04:29.168 --> 04:31.738
are gonna come around
here to look for our...
(door opening)

04:31.771 --> 04:33.005
Buffy.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.577
God, Buffy, are you okay?

04:37.610 --> 04:38.978
What happened?

04:39.012 --> 04:40.480
You know?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.915
I know something went down.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.985
Tell me.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.687
Maggie tried to kill me.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.124
It didn't work,
but they're all upset, anyway.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.961
Okay, listen, I need you to go
over everything, step by step.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.365
There has to be... has to
be some kind of mistake.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.831
XANDER:
There was no mistake.

04:58.865 --> 05:01.334
And how do you know
something happened?

05:01.369 --> 05:05.872
I was on a mission,
but I came back and...

05:05.906 --> 05:08.475
I'm not sure. Look,
let's just keep our heads

05:08.509 --> 05:10.209
and not jump to any...

05:11.379 --> 05:14.047
What?

05:14.081 --> 05:16.149
That's Hostile 17.

05:16.182 --> 05:20.487
(trying to lose accent):
No. I'm just a friend
of Xander's.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.790
(scoffs)
Bugger it. I'm your guy.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.759
This is Spike.
He's, um...

05:27.394 --> 05:29.497
It's a really long story,

05:29.529 --> 05:31.031
but he's not bad anymore.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.466
Hey! What am I--
a bleeding broken record?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.134
I'm bad.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.536
It's just...

05:36.569 --> 05:38.372
I can't bite anymore

05:38.406 --> 05:40.040
thanks to you wankers.

05:40.072 --> 05:41.709
We've been looking all
over the place for him,

05:41.742 --> 05:43.576
but you've known where
he's been all along?

05:43.610 --> 05:44.745
It's not like that.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.745
Then what is it like?

05:45.778 --> 05:47.380
What's he doing here?

05:47.415 --> 05:50.718
Leaving you swabs
to your dramatics, thanks.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.521
I've got my stories
on the telly for that.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.856
By the by, if you're
trying to kill her...

06:04.798 --> 06:08.769
Buffy, what is this,
you're hiding an HST?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.204
Why don't you just back off and
let her ask the questions, Jack?

06:11.237 --> 06:13.372
Your boss just tried to
make monster food out of her.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.747
I-I didn't see much.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.451
I wasn't there.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.918
All I know is Professor Walsh
told me you were dead.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.788
But then I saw you
on the monitors...

06:28.822 --> 06:31.591
Look, this isn't
Professor Walsh.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.293
There must be something
making her act this way,

06:34.326 --> 06:36.629
something-- I-I don't
know-- controlling her.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.130
We think Buffy

06:38.165 --> 06:40.533
may have been
becoming too inquisitive,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.870
that she was getting
close to something

06:43.903 --> 06:45.773
that Professor Walsh
was trying to hide.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.307
Any idea what
that might be?

06:48.341 --> 06:50.478
What about 314?
Maybe that's it.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.045
Maybe she was trying
to test you.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.480
What if it was only a drill?

06:53.514 --> 06:55.081
Then why did she tell you
I was dead?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.317
Riley, it wasn't a test.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.286
GILES:
See, I've heard rumors

06:59.319 --> 07:02.254
that the Initiative isn't
all that we've been told.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.791
That, um, secretly,

07:04.824 --> 07:06.793
they're working towards
some darker purpose,

07:06.826 --> 07:09.161
something that
might harm us all.
No!

07:09.196 --> 07:11.665
That's-that's not
what happens there.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.399
Riley--
I would know.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.668
Look, no one is sure
of anything, okay?

07:14.701 --> 07:15.668
We're just trying
to sort it out.

07:15.702 --> 07:16.769
I can't be here.

07:16.803 --> 07:17.771
I'll sort it out on my own.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.406
Riley.
No!

07:19.439 --> 07:20.807
Just...

07:20.841 --> 07:23.143
I'm sorry.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.047
(door closes)

07:51.904 --> 07:53.706
What am I?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.843
You're a monster.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.882
I thought so.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.117
What are you?

08:04.151 --> 08:06.218
Me?
I'm a boy.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.487
"A boy"?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.990
How do you work?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.225
I don't know.
I just do.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.329
What's that for?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.343
(indistinct chatter)

08:54.234 --> 08:56.536
Dr. Walsh?

08:59.405 --> 09:00.908
Adam?

09:20.326 --> 09:22.830
Oh, God.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.399
(various sounds coming from TV)

09:47.988 --> 09:50.490
(on TV):
Beep beep! Beep beep!

09:56.495 --> 09:57.965
Beep!

10:00.466 --> 10:01.969
(Willow laughs)

10:02.001 --> 10:03.836
That would never happen.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.739
Well, no, Buff, that's why
they call them cartoons,

10:05.773 --> 10:07.539
Not documentaries.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.576
Must we have the noise?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.846
My head is splitting.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.948
Well, look who's cranky bear
in the morning.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.484
Yes,
I can't imagine

10:17.517 --> 10:19.753
why I didn't sleep well
in my beach ball.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.020
Every time you moved,

10:21.053 --> 10:22.489
it made squeaky noises.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.024
It was irritating.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.591
Really? I'm surprised
you could hear it

10:25.625 --> 10:27.661
over your Wagnerian snoring.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
Okay, you guys.
Could we not, please?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.264
Everything's screwed up
enough without you two

10:32.298 --> 10:35.101
doing scenes from
my parent's marriage.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.602
Sorry.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.105
Sorry.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.639
Thank you.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.375
It'll be okay, Buffy.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.778
Riley's just confused,
that's all.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.446
I don't know.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.517
Just seems like things
could get heavier.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.720
His whole world's
falling apart.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.522
And after everything
you've been through with Angel.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.524
You know, you really should get
yourself a boring boyfriend,

10:57.557 --> 10:59.058
like Xander.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.227
You can't have Xander.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.230
That was the idea.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.198
Riley was supposed
to be Mr. Joe Guy.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.201
We were gonna
do dumb things

11:08.235 --> 11:10.070
like hold hands through
the daisies, going

11:10.102 --> 11:11.571
* Tra-la-la.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.407
Poor Buffy, your life resists
all things average.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.576
So dump him.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.577
But you can't have Xander.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.548
I'll try and remember that.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.250
It's too late, anyway.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.585
I'm already at

11:25.618 --> 11:27.653
the "I hurt when he hurts,

11:27.687 --> 11:30.190
I smile when he smiles" stage.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.725
I hate that part.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.761
I'll just have to make it work.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.163
Turn on the TV.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.899
Now!

11:41.134 --> 11:44.270
Sunnydale is still reeling
from news of the crime.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.706
A source in the coroner's
office tells us

11:46.740 --> 11:48.240
that the boy was stabbed with

11:48.274 --> 11:50.710
what looks like
some kind of large skewer,

11:50.744 --> 11:53.679
and his body was then mutilated.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.082
Police have not named a suspect,

11:56.115 --> 11:58.085
and the killer
is still at large...

11:58.118 --> 12:00.953
The Polgara demon
had a skewer in its arm.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.791
That's the one that Maggie
insisted we bring back alive.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.557
She must have sent it after you.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.594
And it got distracted, God!

12:07.626 --> 12:09.229
WILLOW:
Buffy, it's not your fault.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.764
How could you know?

12:10.798 --> 12:13.133
She's right.
You mustn't blame yourself.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.735
I'm not going to.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.770
I'm going to the crime scene

12:17.804 --> 12:19.405
to see what I can find out.

12:19.438 --> 12:20.908
You guys research
the Polgara demon.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.309
I want to know where it is.
When I find it,

12:23.342 --> 12:25.644
I'm going to make him pay
for taking that kid's life.

12:25.677 --> 12:27.780
I'll make him die in ways
he can't even imagine.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.054
That probably would have
sounded more commanding

12:35.087 --> 12:37.857
if I wasn't wearing
my yummy sushi pajamas.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.828
(indistinct chatter)

12:43.831 --> 12:46.732
Hey, where you been all night?

12:46.765 --> 12:49.336
Well, congratulations.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.438
I see you and Buffy finally
gotten past the shy phase.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.673
I wasn't with Buffy.

12:54.706 --> 12:57.644
I needed to be alone,
think some things through.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.011
What things?

12:59.046 --> 13:01.480
Hey, you guys.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.322
This is mighty ominous.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.591
What's up, man?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.693
Professor Walsh tried
to have Buffy killed.

13:14.726 --> 13:15.761
What?

13:15.794 --> 13:17.596
Did Buffy tell you that?

13:17.629 --> 13:19.532
I mean, do you have any proof?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.268
I saw enough to know it's true.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.036
I don't get it.
Why?

13:23.070 --> 13:25.873
I don't know.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.207
Buffy thinks that she's getting
too close to something,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.808
that Professor Walsh
has some secret.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.177
I wouldn't put it
past Buffy to get

13:31.211 --> 13:33.346
on Professor
Walsh's bad side.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.048
She tends to put her nose
where it doesn't belong.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.716
What?
She's a pain.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.384
Always wanting to know
why this and why that.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.552
And you're saying she should
die because of that?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.888
I don't know.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.955
Maybe Professor Walsh
found out that

13:41.989 --> 13:43.056
Buffy was up to something bad.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.024
That ever cross
your mind?

13:45.057 --> 13:46.793
Yeah, why's it bug you so much
that I'm hanging with her?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.628
Is it 'cause she's
a better soldier than you?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.030
It bugs me that she's using you
to infiltrate our operation.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.365
So you're saying she's a spy?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.134
You're crazy.
Riley, think about it.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.735
The professor's not stupid.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.139
If she tried to kill Buffy,
maybe Buffy needed killing.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.740
Guys?

14:01.774 --> 14:04.043
Not now, Private.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.613
What is it?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.883
Professor Walsh is dead.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.463
(indistinct chatter)

14:31.203 --> 14:34.274
(speaking indistinctly)

14:44.317 --> 14:46.753
Look at that wound.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.456
She's been staked,
wouldn't you say, brother?

14:49.489 --> 14:50.623
What?

14:50.657 --> 14:52.024
Only one person
I can think of

14:52.058 --> 14:53.592
who could do
something like that.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.063
You better not

14:57.096 --> 14:58.865
be saying what I think
you're saying.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.633
We-we don't know
a person did this.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.269
A Polgara demon has a skewer
that comes right out--
No way, man!

15:02.302 --> 15:03.535
That's your girlfriend's M.O.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.971
Hey, that's
a serious accusation.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.739
You better be ready to deal
with the consequences.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.941
Bring 'em on!

15:07.975 --> 15:09.741
Supernatural freak
is blinding you,

15:09.775 --> 15:10.442
and I'm sick of it.
That's enough!

15:10.476 --> 15:11.744
Stand back, man!

15:11.778 --> 15:12.980
Show some respect.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.481
Listen.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.284
Everybody's upset, but arguing
isn't gonna help anything.

15:18.317 --> 15:22.688
And it's certainly not what
Professor Walsh would want.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.726
No, sir.

15:27.759 --> 15:29.828
All right.
Good.

15:29.861 --> 15:31.097
Now, Washington
is sending in a team

15:31.130 --> 15:32.631
to do an internal
investigation.

15:32.664 --> 15:33.932
I've been told we have
to wait for their word.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.235
What do you mean "wait"?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.769
This has to be the work

15:36.802 --> 15:38.471
of the Polgara demon
we captured last week.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.505
Probably.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.907
Looks like last night

15:40.940 --> 15:42.975
the Polgara escaped
through tunnel 72.

15:43.009 --> 15:43.842
It's out loose somewhere?

15:43.875 --> 15:44.844
I'm afraid so.

15:44.876 --> 15:46.479
Then we have to go after it.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.615
My orders from Washington
are for a total lockdown

15:48.648 --> 15:49.982
until they arrive.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.951
I'm sorry.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.086
Now return to your quarters.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.023
There's nothing
you can do here.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.866
Listen, Angleman
can talk all he wants,

16:07.899 --> 16:10.269
but I'm still in charge
until the brass gets here

16:10.302 --> 16:12.172
and tells me otherwise.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.873
I say we've got a demon to hunt.

16:13.905 --> 16:15.542
Now suit up for armed patrol,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.476
and by that I mean
loaded guns, men.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.178
Target practice is over.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.513
We're going for blood.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.986
(indistinct chatter)

16:29.922 --> 16:30.889
(tires screech)

16:30.923 --> 16:32.024
Let's go!

16:32.058 --> 16:33.625
Let's move!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.227
Take the West side!

16:35.261 --> 16:36.895
Establish a perimeter!

16:38.264 --> 16:40.100
(indistinct shouting)

16:45.705 --> 16:48.140
Somebody's been
staying here.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.311
What do you think--
a homeless guy?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.047
Could be.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.716
Or a squatter
of the demon variety.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.150
But not the Polgara?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.419
Who cares?!

17:00.452 --> 17:02.054
I see a demon, it dies.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.223
It's warm.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.212
Damn!

17:29.915 --> 17:32.519
Animals.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.953
(door closes)

17:49.801 --> 17:52.172
(bird cries in distance)

18:12.424 --> 18:13.992
Buffy.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.595
Hey.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.964
Hey.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.000
Look, I'm sorry
about earlier.

18:21.032 --> 18:24.570
I know that everyone
came on pretty strong.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.338
And the Spike thing isn't
as tweaked as it looked.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.476
Okay, maybe it is, but

18:29.509 --> 18:32.479
there's an explanation
that almost makes sense.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.980
Hello?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.150
I'm apologizing here.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.117
And I think that's
pretty big of me

18:39.152 --> 18:43.021
considering I'm the one who was
almost made a demon sandwich.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.325
This is the part where
you throw me a bone.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.894
Maggie's dead.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.164
Happy now?

18:54.233 --> 18:57.537
How can you ask me that?

18:57.569 --> 18:59.538
Of course, I'm not happy.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.673
What happened?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.609
That's classified.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.311
Classifi--?

19:05.345 --> 19:08.047
The Polgara.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.715
It got her and escaped.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.351
Didn't it?

19:11.384 --> 19:13.553
I'm gonna find it.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.954
I'm gonna find it
and destroy it.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.957
And then you can
stop asking me

19:17.990 --> 19:20.759
how happy all this
death makes me.

19:29.701 --> 19:31.503
(knocking)

19:34.006 --> 19:35.575
Howdy.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.009
I just got your message
a minute ago.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.211
I was in class,

19:38.244 --> 19:40.547
but I was about to call you.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.382
I had so much fun
the other night.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.750
Those spells.

19:43.782 --> 19:46.184
Yeah, that was nice.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.086
I hope you don't think

19:48.119 --> 19:51.324
that I just come over for
the spells and everything.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.092
I mean, I really
like just talking

19:53.125 --> 19:55.927
and-and hanging out
with you and stuff.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.664
I know that.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.000
But you want to do a spell.

20:01.032 --> 20:04.202
Yeah, but only because
it's really important.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.771
There's this--

20:05.805 --> 20:07.173
No, y-you don't
have to explain.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.907
I don't mind, really.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.376
I've been, um, thinking about

20:10.410 --> 20:12.912
that last spell we did all day.

20:12.944 --> 20:15.515
You have?
Mm-hmm.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.182
Well, this one should
be really fun, too.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.218
We conjure the Goddess
Thespia to help us

20:19.251 --> 20:21.354
locate demonic energy
in the area.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.189
Shouldn't be
too tricky.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.090
"The Goddess Thespia"?

20:25.124 --> 20:26.625
Are you sure
we're ready for that?

20:26.659 --> 20:30.162
You and me?
This is beneath us.

20:32.230 --> 20:35.335
Okay, if you say so.

20:37.304 --> 20:40.272
* Caught between the twisted
stars, the plotted lines *

20:40.307 --> 20:45.044
* And faulty map that brought
Columbus to New York *

20:45.076 --> 20:46.645
* Betwixt between
the east and west *

20:46.679 --> 20:49.648
* He calls on her wearing
a leather vest... *

20:49.682 --> 20:52.250
You're killing me here.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.921
Oh, missed you, too.
Joint's jumping.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.789
Yeah, you know... I'm making
some changes with my life.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.425
I'm getting away
from my old image.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.227
You mean as
a double-dealing snitch?

21:01.259 --> 21:03.329
Uh-huh. I know you're gonna
think I'm blowing smoke,

21:03.363 --> 21:05.897
but after those apocalypse
demons nearly did me in,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.567
I had an experience of
the spiritual variety.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.501
That's swell, really,
but I need to know

21:09.536 --> 21:10.970
if you've heard anything
about a Polgara demon

21:11.002 --> 21:12.238
doing some killings
in the last few days.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.740
See, uh, that's the thing.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.643
I don't talk behind
people's backs no more.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.911
And I'm bringing some class
to the joint, you know?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.747
It's Willy's place now, see?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.248
Brings in a better clientele.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.982
I got one of those deep fryers.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.185
These demons just go crazy
for chicken fingers.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.189
Look, if they see me
dealing with you,

21:30.221 --> 21:31.691
then I'm just
the same old Willy,

21:31.723 --> 21:33.359
working both sides
of the street.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.993
I'm gonna have to punch you--
aren't I?

21:35.027 --> 21:36.162
Just once, and it
don't have to hurt.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.229
Just make it look good.

21:39.230 --> 21:40.432
Ow!
Ow!

21:40.467 --> 21:42.335
Not yet.
I haven't touched you.

21:42.368 --> 21:44.202
Oh, sorry.
Right.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.938
Right, g-g-go ahead.

21:45.971 --> 21:46.972
Wait.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.509
No, I can't talk to you--

21:49.541 --> 21:52.278
Oh!
Oh!

21:52.310 --> 21:54.846
What have you heard
about the Polgara?

21:54.881 --> 21:57.182
I heard there was one
around a week or two back.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.385
Word was you got him.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.119
You and those Army guys.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.821
And that was
the last you heard?

22:02.855 --> 22:04.957
Yeah, as far as I know,
he's off the streets.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.558
What about those Army guys?
What do you know?

22:06.593 --> 22:09.395
You heard anything about 314?

22:17.737 --> 22:18.871
What are you doing here?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.306
Following me?

22:20.338 --> 22:21.907
You told me you were
tracking the Polgara demon.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.410
I thought I'd help.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.344
But now I see
you're not hunting demons,

22:25.377 --> 22:26.913
you're socializing with them.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.048
Again.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.883
Thought you were supposed
to be killing these things,

22:30.916 --> 22:32.919
not buying them drinks.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.020
Oh, that's smooth,
Officer Riley.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.189
They teach you those undercover
moves in Special Forces?

22:37.222 --> 22:38.391
Yeah, I'm serious, Buffy.

22:38.424 --> 22:40.259
What are you doing here?

22:40.291 --> 22:41.728
Just cooling her dogs
like the rest of us.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.596
Why don't you sit down, relax?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.163
I want you to tell me.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.932
Who are you?

22:46.965 --> 22:48.835
WILLY:
No kidding.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.769
How about I get you some
chicken fingers on the house?

22:50.802 --> 22:51.903
Hey, think you
could shut up?

22:51.938 --> 22:53.005
Look, I-I'm just saying--

22:53.038 --> 22:55.074
I said shut up, or maybe

22:55.106 --> 22:56.576
you'd like to go back
to the lab with me?

22:56.608 --> 22:58.277
I'm sure the coats would
love to classify a--

22:58.309 --> 22:59.746
whatever you are.

22:59.778 --> 23:00.779
Leave him alone, Riley.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.781
He's human.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.083
So he's human.

23:04.115 --> 23:05.751
You're shaking.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.753
He just harbors demons,
which makes him a good guy

23:07.787 --> 23:09.955
like you?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.558
The truth, Buffy, now!

23:12.592 --> 23:14.125
You have the truth.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.694
You are just
too screwed up

23:15.728 --> 23:17.195
because of what happened
to Professor Walsh to see it.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.431
Now let go of me!

23:18.464 --> 23:19.432
Hold it!

23:19.465 --> 23:20.532
You.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.934
No leaving till I say so.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.436
Got it?

23:24.471 --> 23:25.805
Hey, we got new rules here.

23:25.837 --> 23:27.105
No killing.

23:27.138 --> 23:29.275
Right, except the rules

23:29.307 --> 23:31.343
don't seem to apply
much these days, do they?

23:33.945 --> 23:37.215
Like if I shot you right now.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.384
I don't know if I'd have
a corpse on my hands

23:38.416 --> 23:40.152
or one pissed-off vampire.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.454
Riley!
I mean, who do you believe?

23:42.489 --> 23:44.990
First it sounds like lies,

23:45.023 --> 23:46.459
then it sounds like truth.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.627
Riley.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.798
(sobbing):
No...

23:52.832 --> 23:54.834
No, please...

24:06.945 --> 24:08.815
Oh, what's happening to me?

24:26.397 --> 24:28.634
(whispering):
Riley.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.670
Why don't you lie down?

24:30.702 --> 24:32.904
You'll be more
comfortable.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.875
Stop it.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.443
I can't.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.179
It's like...

24:40.211 --> 24:43.281
something's crawling inside.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.683
No.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.385
You're hurting yourself.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.622
(whispering):
Come here.

24:49.655 --> 24:50.656
Okay.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.358
Shh.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.961
I thought I knew...
but I don't.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.663
I don't know anything.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.230
Shh.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.900
You're sick.

25:00.932 --> 25:02.134
Once you get some rest--

25:02.167 --> 25:04.537
No.
Buffy...

25:04.570 --> 25:07.006
I don't know anything.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.909
I don't know

25:09.942 --> 25:11.711
which team I'm on,

25:11.743 --> 25:14.246
who the bad guys are.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.917
Maybe I'm the bad guy.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.053
Maybe I'm the thing

25:21.086 --> 25:22.087
you should kill.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.422
No.

25:23.454 --> 25:25.857
Don't you even think that.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.059
Okay, listen to me.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.162
You're sick.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.999
You just need to
get some sleep.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.901
Please.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.036
Lie down for me?

25:40.906 --> 25:42.909
Come on.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.659
You're gonna be okay.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.951
How is he?

26:24.983 --> 26:27.586
This isn't just grief
making him act this way.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.454
Something's affecting him
physically

26:29.488 --> 26:31.457
and it's getting worse.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.058
You think Professor Walsh
did something to him?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.894
I don't know,
but I'm ready to find out.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.763
That's gonna be tough, what
with Maggie's deadness and all.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.065
She must have
kept records somewhere--

26:39.097 --> 26:41.599
about Riley, about 314,
about all of it.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.134
And I'm sure she wasn't
the only person

26:43.169 --> 26:44.302
that knew what she was up to.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.938
So what's the plan?

26:45.971 --> 26:48.173
Giles, Anya, keep researching.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.576
Xander, you and I
are going undercover.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.846
Hey, remember before?

26:53.880 --> 26:56.115
No Xander,
not in a boyfriend way

26:56.147 --> 26:58.450
or a "lead him
to certain death" way.

26:58.483 --> 27:00.653
He's the only one
with military experience.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.153
It's not like
he was in the 'Nam.

27:02.188 --> 27:04.123
He was G.I. Joe
for one night!

27:04.155 --> 27:05.758
XANDER:
It's okay, Anya.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.292
I've backed up
Buffy before.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.028
ANYA: Can't you do something
else to help them?

27:09.060 --> 27:10.696
Like Xerox handouts
or something?

27:10.730 --> 27:12.664
I'll be careful.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.134
Promise.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.671
It's a minor point,

27:18.704 --> 27:20.707
but how do you plan to
get into the Initiative?

27:20.740 --> 27:23.541
I'm-I'm sure their security
system's almost impenetrable.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.144
I have my clearance.
I'm hoping she didn't

27:25.176 --> 27:26.311
have time to revoke it.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.646
Okay, well, as for the, uh,

27:28.681 --> 27:30.281
whereabouts
of this Polgara demon,

27:30.316 --> 27:32.218
I'm afraid we not
turned up much.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.221
There have been no reports
since its original capture.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.623
Then we'll just
have to keep looking.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.960
So the square
is Sunnydale.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.296
Right, it's like a map.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.565
We both take different
parts of the potion,

27:46.597 --> 27:48.500
and when we do the incantation,

27:48.534 --> 27:50.568
we both blow it onto the square

27:50.602 --> 27:52.904
at the exact same time.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.874
But how does it work?

27:54.906 --> 27:56.474
Well, that's the cool part.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.677
When the potion mixes
and Thespia's called,

27:59.711 --> 28:04.083
it creates this mist over the
parts where the demons are.

28:04.115 --> 28:07.685
It even makes different colors
for different breeds.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.587
Wow.

28:09.621 --> 28:12.057
You ready?

28:23.634 --> 28:25.805
Let's do it.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.210
Thespia...

28:31.242 --> 28:33.112
we walk in shadow,

28:33.144 --> 28:35.614
walk in blindness.

28:35.646 --> 28:38.517
You are the protector
of the night.

28:38.549 --> 28:40.618
Thespia,

28:40.652 --> 28:42.253
goddess,
ruler of all darkness.

28:42.288 --> 28:45.857
We implore you,
open a window

28:45.892 --> 28:48.559
to the world
of the underbeing.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.967
With your knowledge,

28:55.000 --> 28:56.134
may we go in safety.

28:56.167 --> 28:57.804
With your grace,

28:57.836 --> 29:00.172
may we speak
of your benevolence.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.612
Or not.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.054
Seems pretty quiet.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.022
It usually is
this time of--

29:32.671 --> 29:35.141
Buff, maybe you should
check the look later.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.342
Shh!

29:36.375 --> 29:39.111
Ow! What'd you
do that for?

29:39.144 --> 29:42.314
Sorry, I'm the only one that
can pass the retinal scan.

29:42.347 --> 29:43.781
The--

29:43.816 --> 29:45.151
Ew!

29:45.183 --> 29:46.751
I don't want to see that.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.686
Retinal scan, Xander.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.490
Well, we'll know
in a few seconds

29:52.523 --> 29:54.326
if my clearance
is still good.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.127
Or if we're
about to die

29:56.162 --> 29:58.497
at the hands of 50
grief-fueled military goons.

29:58.529 --> 29:59.999
FEMALE VOICE:
Retinal scan recorded.

30:00.031 --> 30:01.432
Summers, Buffy.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.502
Why am I not
entirely comforted

30:04.536 --> 30:07.373
by the arrival of
the man-size microwave?

30:16.682 --> 30:20.051
(indistinct chatter)

30:20.086 --> 30:22.621
Holy moley!

30:22.653 --> 30:24.655
I know.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.894
XANDER:
I totally get it now.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.929
Can I have sex
with Riley, too?

30:39.371 --> 30:40.739
Quick, pretend
to make out with me!

30:40.771 --> 30:42.740
What? What are you
talking about?!

30:42.773 --> 30:44.375
XANDER:
Well, I, uh...

30:44.410 --> 30:46.545
You know, in the movies, the guy
and the girl have to hide.

30:46.577 --> 30:48.213
Please.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.282
Could you possibly draw
 more attention to us?

30:53.285 --> 30:56.822
FEMALE VOICE (over intercom):
Agent Owens to Interrogation.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.690
This is the Initiative, Xander.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.592
Military guys and scientists

31:00.625 --> 31:02.260
do not make out with each other.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.029
Well, maybe that's
what's wrong with the world.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.531
Ever think about that?

31:06.565 --> 31:07.699
WILLOW:
I totally failed.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.067
It wasn't even

31:09.101 --> 31:10.201
like the spell went wrong,

31:10.236 --> 31:11.737
it just wouldn't.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.105
Well, if it's any consolation,

31:13.138 --> 31:14.506
we haven't fared
much better here.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.041
Really?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.608
Is Riley okay?

31:17.643 --> 31:19.211
Well, he's asleep, finally.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.680
He doesn't look good.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.715
And the, uh, research
is troubling as well.

31:24.750 --> 31:27.185
I mean, this- this demon
we're after

31:27.219 --> 31:29.587
seems highly atypical
for a Polgara.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.789
This child that it killed
was... mutilated.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.724
There's no recorded cases

31:33.759 --> 31:35.260
of a Polgara ever having
done such a thing.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.394
ANYA:
Also, the Polgara

31:36.427 --> 31:38.130
have to eat every two hours.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.765
Factor in the low I.Q.,
and you have a demon

31:39.798 --> 31:41.366
who's not exactly low profile.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.800
WILLOW:
So how has he been

31:42.834 --> 31:44.702
hiding out in Sunnydale
for the last two days

31:44.736 --> 31:46.404
without anyone seeing him?

31:46.438 --> 31:49.075
GILES:
Exactly.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.308
(gasps)

31:52.177 --> 31:53.811
Riley.
Where's Buffy?

31:53.845 --> 31:55.780
Uh, she went out.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.415
Can-can I get you something?

31:57.449 --> 32:01.086
Just tell me where she is.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.088
You're not well, Riley.
You-you need to rest.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.490
Did she find the Polgara?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.092
Huh?
Is that it?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.593
No, we-we're
still looking, but--

32:07.625 --> 32:08.727
But what?

32:08.759 --> 32:09.894
WILLOW:
She went to find out

32:09.928 --> 32:10.929
what's making you sick.

32:10.962 --> 32:12.730
I'm not sick.

32:12.763 --> 32:15.800
Are you telling me
she went to the Initiative?

32:15.834 --> 32:18.104
Riley, she's just
trying to help you.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.172
She doesn't belong there.

32:20.205 --> 32:22.508
Riley, listen.

32:22.540 --> 32:23.808
Stand away from the stairs.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.943
No. You're gonna
get Buffy killed!

32:25.978 --> 32:27.778
Hey!

32:29.948 --> 32:31.682
Are you all right?

32:34.552 --> 32:37.855
MAN:
How many of the men
are still out?

32:37.888 --> 32:39.657
The longer they go
without their meds--

32:39.691 --> 32:41.692
Everyone's off their
schedules because

32:41.727 --> 32:43.362
of the professor's death.
That's dangerous.

32:43.394 --> 32:44.796
I don't want to think
about the damage our guys

32:44.829 --> 32:46.164
could do under the
stress of withdrawal.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.333
Especially since
they won't understand

32:47.365 --> 32:48.933
what's happening to them.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.502
These guys don't know
they've been getting meds

32:51.537 --> 32:54.705
through their food, so we'd
better get them in here, stat.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.708
We've located
all but a few.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.777
The last ones were
in pretty bad shape,

32:58.809 --> 33:00.645
but we stabilized them.
But Finn wasn't
one of them, right?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.713
No.
Find him.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.215
He's the one I care about.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.983
He's too important
to the work to lose now.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.019
Indeed.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.123
* I have said it

33:11.156 --> 33:15.727
* Time and time again

33:15.760 --> 33:18.130
Double shot of O-Neg, keep.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.132
Make it the good stuff.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.833
I don't want no
freakin' orangutan.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.403
Got ya.

33:24.435 --> 33:27.472
Been a pisser of a
day, isn't it?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.675
Those Army blokes
are on the tear.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.112
They ran me out of my
place and all over town.

33:34.445 --> 33:37.415
Yeah, what's that?

33:37.449 --> 33:38.450
(Spike grunts)

33:39.951 --> 33:41.752
Keep me posted.
I'll be in records.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.740
Now I don't generally
like to kill humans,

34:01.772 --> 34:03.909
but I've learned that it pays
to be flexible in life.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.544
I was wondering
when you'd turn up.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.078
Oh, darn.

34:07.113 --> 34:10.215
So this isn't a surprise?

34:10.248 --> 34:13.085
Now, you can tell me
what you did to Riley,

34:13.119 --> 34:15.887
and after that we can
take a tour of room 314.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.590
Somebody's coming, you know.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.891
I'm sure they've already seen
you on the security monitors.

34:20.925 --> 34:23.362
Monitors are non-functional
at this time, sir.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.231
Went down about ten minutes ago.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.132
What?
I didn't do that.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.599
Thank God for small favors,
and we'll worry

34:28.634 --> 34:30.235
about details later, huh, Buff?

34:30.268 --> 34:32.938
Finn, take this girl to
the stockade immediately.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.407
Riley, he can tell us
what we need to know.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.809
Maggie wanted me dead,
didn't she?

34:37.842 --> 34:39.411
She did.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.079
But understand, the Initiative

34:42.114 --> 34:44.081
has no interest
in eliminating the slayer.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.451
It was her own vendetta.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.585
Why?

34:46.617 --> 34:47.952
Spell it out for me.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.920
I feel an attack
of dumb blonde coming on.

34:49.954 --> 34:50.755
I don't know.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.590
Well, think harder.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.596
It was... the project.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.266
Project?
314.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.601
It...

35:04.001 --> 35:05.570
It escaped.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.806
That's enough.

35:07.838 --> 35:10.175
You're making her sound
like some psychopath.

35:10.208 --> 35:11.677
She wasn't like that.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.179
She was a brilliant woman.

35:13.211 --> 35:14.679
She was.
It's not--

35:14.713 --> 35:16.315
All she was doing was
trying to help people.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.849
And this is the way you want
them to remember her?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.585
Angleman said Walsh
was feeding you drugs.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.952
You're doing this
to me, aren't you?

35:21.987 --> 35:23.355
This all started
because of you.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.822
Look, if you will
just listen to me, okay?

35:24.856 --> 35:26.992
I am trying to help you
get to the truth.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.460
You want truth? Then tell me--

35:28.494 --> 35:29.960
what did you do to her, Buffy?

35:29.994 --> 35:32.764
Stop it. I didn't do anything.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.798
Riley, stop!

35:33.831 --> 35:35.701
This isn't about us.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.436
Everything that
we need to know is here.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.704
We just need to find out
what was in 314.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.344
Me.

35:51.882 --> 35:54.018
I've been thinking
about the world.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.556
I wanted to see it.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.525
Learn it.

35:59.557 --> 36:03.061
I saw the inside of that boy
and it was beautiful.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.231
But it didn't tell me
about the world.

36:06.264 --> 36:09.367
It just made me feel.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.302
So now...

36:11.336 --> 36:14.139
I want to learn about me.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.742
Why I feel.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.010
What I am.

36:20.411 --> 36:23.181
So I came home.

36:29.621 --> 36:33.090
I am a kinematically redundant
biomechanical demonoid

36:33.123 --> 36:35.059
designed by Maggie Walsh.

36:35.092 --> 36:36.927
She called me Adam,

36:36.961 --> 36:38.429
and I called her Mother.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.833
Adam, Maggie would
want you to stand down.

36:41.867 --> 36:45.135
Yes, but I seem
to have a design flaw.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.576
In addition to organic material,

36:50.608 --> 36:54.545
I'm equipped with GP2D-11
infrared detectors,

36:54.579 --> 36:57.215
a harmonic decelerator,
plus DC Servo.

36:57.248 --> 36:59.885
She pieced you together
from parts of other demons.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.853
And man.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.088
And machine.

37:04.121 --> 37:07.092
Which tells me what I am,

37:07.125 --> 37:09.561
but not who I am.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.699
Mother wrote things down.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.304
Hard data,
but also her feelings.

37:18.336 --> 37:21.907
That's how I learned
that I have a job here

37:21.940 --> 37:23.942
and that she loved me.

37:23.974 --> 37:26.311
She wasn't your mother
and she didn't love you.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.913
Is that really
the issue?

37:27.945 --> 37:30.581
RILEY:
She made you because
she was a scientist.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.250
Riley.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.753
Riley Finn.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.123
Stop. Those files...

37:38.155 --> 37:40.958
Oh. Mother created you, too.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.494
Maggie is not
my mother.

37:42.527 --> 37:43.929
I have a mother, a real...

37:43.961 --> 37:47.766
A birth mother, yes.
But after you met Maggie,

37:47.798 --> 37:50.635
she was the one who shaped
your basic operating system.

37:50.668 --> 37:53.304
She taught you
how to think,

37:53.338 --> 37:54.972
how to feel.

37:55.005 --> 37:57.842
She fed you chemicals
to make you stronger.

37:57.876 --> 38:00.679
Your mind
and body.

38:00.711 --> 38:03.315
She said that you and I were
her favorite children.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.016
Her art.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.987
That makes us brothers-- family.

38:09.019 --> 38:11.789
No, I'm not like you.

38:11.822 --> 38:14.659
That's pain, isn't it?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.094
Why?

38:16.126 --> 38:19.197
Because your feeding schedule--
the chemicals--

38:19.230 --> 38:21.932
have been interrupted?

38:21.967 --> 38:24.702
Or do you miss her? Tell me.

38:24.735 --> 38:25.804
I'll kill you.

38:25.836 --> 38:27.338
You won't.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.773
You haven't been programmed to.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.643
I cannot be programmed.
I'm a man.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.177
It's here.

38:33.210 --> 38:35.045
The plan she had for us.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.215
What happens.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.248
How it ends.

38:39.550 --> 38:40.619
No.

38:40.652 --> 38:41.887
Do you want to hear?

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
No.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.856
(grunting)

39:01.239 --> 39:02.474
Doctor.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.510
(crunch)

39:09.514 --> 39:10.548
Aah!

39:10.581 --> 39:11.782
(moans)

39:16.353 --> 39:17.355
(muffled shouting)

39:23.360 --> 39:25.096
Thank you.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.833
This has been...

39:27.865 --> 39:29.233
very interesting.

39:33.938 --> 39:36.074
MAN (muffled):
Back away from the door!

39:38.943 --> 39:40.811
(banging on door)

39:43.047 --> 39:44.916
(gunshots)

39:44.949 --> 39:47.918
Riley. Are you okay?

39:49.887 --> 39:53.123
Secure the room.
Go, go!

39:53.157 --> 39:54.693
You got a demon in here.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.862
It escaped through that vent.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.630
It's not the Polgara.
It looks sort of half-man.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.932
Right, and you just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.702
She's telling the truth.
I saw it.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.905
It killed Angleman.
Go. Now.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.940
Yes, sir.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.914
He needs to go to a hospital.

40:16.947 --> 40:18.248
We'll take it from here.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.416
I'm going with him.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.552
It's a military hospital.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.621
No.
Back off!

40:22.653 --> 40:24.590
We take care of our own
around here, understand?

40:27.759 --> 40:29.027
Buffy.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.672
Escort them out.

40:43.273 --> 40:44.675
Buffy.

40:48.045 --> 40:50.047
(thumping)

40:57.655 --> 41:01.159
What did you expect, Spike--
a welcome party?

41:01.192 --> 41:03.762
Word's out.
You've been making war

41:03.795 --> 41:04.963
on the demon world.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.197
War?

41:06.231 --> 41:08.199
With the slayer.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.034
You kill other demons,

41:10.068 --> 41:12.202
and the rest of us
don't hold with that.

41:12.237 --> 41:15.673
Still... if I see you
around here again,

41:15.706 --> 41:18.108
I'll be inclined
to break that code.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.711
Do you understand?

41:30.889 --> 41:32.289
No word from Riley?

41:32.322 --> 41:34.291
Nothing.

41:34.324 --> 41:37.327
The Initiative probably has him
locked in some medical ward.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.063
There's no way
I can get near him

41:39.097 --> 41:40.798
until I come up
with a better plan

41:40.831 --> 41:43.233
than just storming in
and getting us all shot.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.371
Yeah, you might want to work
the kinks out of that one.

41:46.403 --> 41:48.505
What am I gonna do?

41:48.539 --> 41:51.309
He needs me and I
can't get near him.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.911
You'll find a way.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.246
It's not like I can
spend all my energy

41:56.280 --> 41:57.849
going after
the Initiative.

41:57.882 --> 42:00.184
Not while Adam's out there.

42:00.217 --> 42:02.420
He's really
that big of a threat?

42:02.452 --> 42:05.891
I could barely fight him.

42:05.923 --> 42:08.927
It was like Maggie designed him
to be the ultimate warrior.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.661
He's smart and fast.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.030
He gave the commando guys
the slip with no problem.

42:13.063 --> 42:14.398
There's got to be a flaw.

42:14.431 --> 42:17.367
I think the part
where he's pure evil

42:17.402 --> 42:20.237
and kills randomly
was an oversight.

42:21.972 --> 42:24.842
I never should have
let them take Riley.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.077
I need to be with him.

42:27.112 --> 42:30.114
I'm sure he's okay.

42:30.148 --> 42:31.916
There's no way he can be.

42:31.949 --> 42:35.052
Everything he's ever believed in
has been taken away or...

42:37.088 --> 42:39.356
He's alone.

42:39.389 --> 42:42.327
He has nothing to hold on to.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.222
Grr. Argh.
