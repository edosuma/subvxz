00:01.401 --> 00:03.164
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.235 --> 00:06.933
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.099
In New York City,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.109
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.177 --> 00:14.738
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.814 --> 00:16.782
These are their stories,

00:19.319 --> 00:21.719
My wife didn't turn
the alarm on again.

00:21.788 --> 00:24.052
TAYLOR: I never turn mine on
when I'm home.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.282
Wow.

00:26.659 --> 00:29.184
My entire apartment
would fit in here.

00:29.262 --> 00:32.128
Original detail,
huge fireplace.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.656
I have two more of those.
One in the den,
one in the master bedroom.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.226
You should
turn this place
into your restaurant.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.704
Can't be more elegant.
Well, you know,
that's all Jessie.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.607
She's got the sense of style.
She's got an eye...

00:43.977 --> 00:45.103
Jess?

00:46.479 --> 00:47.707
Maybe she's out.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.976
No. She had no plans to...

00:50.750 --> 00:52.183
(JESSICA MOANING)
Jessica?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.549
Jessica?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.254
The phone's over there!
Dial 911!

00:58.324 --> 00:59.518
TAYLOR: Oh, my God.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.890
Honey, I'm here, Jess.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.191
Victim is Jessica BIaine-Todd,
early 40s.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.732
Husband and a friend
found her
raped and bludgeoned.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.926
BIudgeoned with what?

01:08.001 --> 01:09.263
Haven't found it, yet.

01:09.335 --> 01:10.393
He was upstairs, too.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.495
Drawers pulled out
everywhere,
closets emptied.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.698
We're gonna be here
for a while.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.934
Front door Iooks clean.
Come in through a window?

01:16.009 --> 01:17.909
No sign of forced entry
anywhere in the house.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.842
Was the alarm on?
TODD: No.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.141
Not when I came in,

01:21.214 --> 01:23.614
but there's a panic button
in every room.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.810
We just had them installed.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.082
I'm Jessica's husband,
Edwin Todd.

01:28.154 --> 01:31.021
Detectives
Benson and Stabler,
Special Victims Unit.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.388
Did your wife
say anything?

01:32.459 --> 01:33.585
No. Nothing.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.321
Just...
I found her moaning.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.192
And you were with a friend
when you found her?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.560
Yeah. My real estate guy.

01:38.631 --> 01:41.464
We'd just put
a deposit on a space
for my new restaurant.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.365
We went out to celebrate.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.425
How's she doing?

01:44.504 --> 01:46.495
Fractured skull,
drifting in and out
of consciousness.

01:46.573 --> 01:47.767
We're trying to
get the pressure up.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.832
Mrs. Todd,
I'm Detective Benson.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.638
Can you tell me
what happened?

01:51.711 --> 01:54.544
Isn't the sunset beautiful?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.912
She's not
moving her right side,
and her speech is slurred.

01:56.983 --> 01:58.883
BIows to the head
might've caused a stroke.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.317
BP's stable. Let's go.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.417
I'm right with you, Jess.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.990
There's three fireplaces,
could've come through
the chimney.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.428
Maybe we should be Iooking
for a guy in a red suit.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.746 --> 03:01.941
What's the prognosis?

03:02.015 --> 03:06.384
Jessica is paralyzed
on her right side
and can't speak.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.681
They say the next
48 hours are critical.

03:10.757 --> 03:13.191
And are you
up for answering
any more questions?

03:13.259 --> 03:14.726
Anything.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.388
BENSON: Was the door closed
and Iocked when you came home?

03:17.463 --> 03:18.794
Yes.

03:18.865 --> 03:23.325
But Jessica always forgets
to turn on the alarm
when she's in the house.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.997
Mr. Todd, aside from
you and your wife,

03:26.072 --> 03:28.336
does anybody else
have access?

03:28.408 --> 03:30.501
Our cleaning Iady, Katarina.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.777
She knows the codes.
She has a spare set of keys.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.144
As a matter of fact,
I just gave her a new set.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.616
Why? Did she Iose hers?
No, no, no.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.711
There's been
a string of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

03:41.788 --> 03:45.019
That's why I upgraded
the alarm system
and changed the Iocks,

03:45.091 --> 03:47.719
to prevent something
Iike this from happening.

03:47.794 --> 03:48.852
Edwin Todd was right.

03:48.928 --> 03:50.919
Six burglaries in the Iast
month in his neighborhood.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.396
STABLER: Bad guys go
where the money is.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.296
Any of these break-ins
turn violent?

03:54.367 --> 03:55.425
This was the first.

03:55.501 --> 03:57.594
Precinct squad says
their perp usually breaks in

03:57.670 --> 04:00.036
through a window
or door though,
not Iike our guy.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.540
Well, plenty of rapists
start out as burglars.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.609
Maybe he's refining
his act.

04:04.677 --> 04:08.169
No current burglaries
anywhere else in Manhattan
with Iast night's M.O.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.217
Well, make sure we also
run down any old burglaries

04:11.284 --> 04:12.512
where the perps
turned violent

04:12.585 --> 04:14.780
and either made parole
or finished doing their time.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.981
Any chance
she accidentally
Ieft the door open?

04:17.055 --> 04:18.488
Can't.
It's on a spring Iock.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.024
And it Iocks automatically.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.321
What about the cleaning woman?

04:21.394 --> 04:22.918
Her name's Katarina Dinov.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.055
Naturalized from the Ukraine,
no rap sheet.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.928
We're heading out to
talk to her right now.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.729
Well, this started out
as a burglary.

04:28.801 --> 04:31.827
The victim's husband
should know by now
if anything's missing.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.735
Captain, you got a second?

04:33.806 --> 04:35.205
CRAGEN: What's up, John?

04:35.642 --> 04:38.338
Bad timing.
I got jury duty in an hour.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.845
And you're
just telling me now?
Get your ass down there.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.312
It's your civic duty,
John.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.111
The Mayor can do it,
so can you.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.708
I'II go with you to talk
to the cleaning Iady.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.582
Thanks.

04:50.823 --> 04:54.782
Jerry BIaine,
Jess's first husband,
was an investment banker.

04:54.861 --> 04:58.797
He did a deal for me,
made me a Iot of money.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.526
We stayed in touch.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.761
You're not from here?
No, Seattle.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.228
I couldn't make it
to Jerry's funeral,

05:06.306 --> 05:09.070
so I made sure that
the next time I came
to town

05:09.142 --> 05:10.905
I took Jessica
out to dinner.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.070
That must have
been awkward for you
to see each other again

05:13.146 --> 05:14.545
under the circumstances.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.844
No, actually,
we'd never met.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.918
But something hit
both of us that night.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.546
You know, as if we had
known each other always.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.516
I Iost my wife
three years ago to cancer.

05:26.592 --> 05:30.084
Jessica understood exactly
what I was going through.

05:30.530 --> 05:34.125
We married at
her summer house

05:34.200 --> 05:36.259
on Martha's Vineyard
a year Iater.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.700
Can you think of any reason
why someone would want to
hurt your wife?

05:40.773 --> 05:42.866
No. Everybody Ioves her.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.215
Are you missing something?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.808
Yeah. Jessica's watch.

05:52.885 --> 05:56.150
I can't remember if she was
wearing it when we found her.

05:56.222 --> 05:57.883
BENSON: Well, where does
she usually keep it?

05:57.957 --> 06:01.552
Right here
on the night table
when she goes to sleep.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.891
The rest of the jewelry's
in the safe.

06:03.963 --> 06:07.399
Not on the Iist of
what CSU sent to the Iab.
What kind of watch is it?

06:07.467 --> 06:08.866
TODD: Rolex.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.266
What's its value?

06:10.336 --> 06:12.429
35,000.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.240
It's horrible what happened
to Mrs. BIaine.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.641
I thought her Iast name
was Todd.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.742
I can't get used
to her new name.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.741
Mr. BIaine was a Iovely man.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.845
AIways took time
to ask me how I was.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.014
They divorced?

06:31.791 --> 06:35.124
He drowned on vacation
in the Bahamas two years ago.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.388
When did Mr. Todd
come into the picture?

06:39.465 --> 06:41.933
Not Iong after
Mr. BIaine died.

06:42.001 --> 06:43.969
Sounds Iike you mean
not Iong enough.

06:44.036 --> 06:47.870
When Mr. BIaine was alive,
I Iived in their house
five years,

06:47.974 --> 06:51.740
but Mr. Todd made me move out
because he wanted his privacy.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.467
You Iive with someone?

06:53.546 --> 06:54.604
My boyfriend.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.942
He got a name?

06:56.015 --> 06:57.448
Andrei Gorsky.

06:57.517 --> 06:59.041
CRAGEN:
Where was he Iast night?

06:59.118 --> 07:02.281
He's a Iimo driver.
He worked until 4:00
in the morning.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.414
I was at my neighbor's
waiting for him.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.253
Andrei took my keys
by mistake.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.316
I couldn't get in
until he came home.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.921
Yesterday was my day off.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.193
Let's see. Gorsky.

07:15.001 --> 07:17.299
Nope, didn't work Iast night.
You sure?

07:17.370 --> 07:19.497
He's not in the Iog,
he wasn't driving.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.405
Well, does
he have a cell phone,
someway we can find him?

07:22.475 --> 07:24.568
Yeah.
He's the one vacuuming
out his car in the back,

07:24.644 --> 07:26.111
just about to go on shift.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.875
Hey, Gorsky!
You got visitors!

07:32.552 --> 07:34.315
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.215
Don't even think about it.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.194
Must've been
something we said.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.196
That any way
to treat company?

07:45.264 --> 07:46.731
Where were you Iast night?

07:46.799 --> 07:49.290
This is a free country.
I go where I please.

07:49.368 --> 07:51.928
You know the people
Katarina works for?
Mr. and Mrs. Todd?

07:52.004 --> 07:53.528
Well, I drive them
to the airport.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.198
So you've been
to their house.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.571
How much you get
for the Rolex?

07:56.642 --> 07:58.371
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.536
Sure you do.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.840
You had Katarina's keys.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.312
You went to
the Upper East Side,

08:02.381 --> 08:05.043
you took Mrs. Todd's watch,
and you raped her.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.243
Rape?

08:07.453 --> 08:12.220
I didn't rape anybody,
and I didn't steal a watch.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.816
I forgot I had Katarina's
keys, man. This is crazy.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.691
And it's the Iast chance
you get to tell us the truth.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.821
Where were you Iast night?

08:19.565 --> 08:21.032
With someone.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.795
Well, you told Katarina
you were working.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.769
Well, I was with
my other girlfriend.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.997
Is she gonna verify that?

08:26.072 --> 08:27.539
'Cause you really don't
want to waste my time.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.199
I'II give you
her phone number.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.472
CRAGEN:
If you didn't do anything,
Andrei, why'd you try to run?

08:35.581 --> 08:37.275
Let me see your green card.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.410
I don't have one.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.816
FIN:
How'd you get in the country?

08:40.886 --> 08:42.878
Student visa,
three years ago.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.820
CRAGEN: And instead of
going to school,
you went to work.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.722
You better kiss
your two girlfriends goodbye.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.692
Immigration's cracking down
on cats Iike you.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.388
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.925
(GROANS)

08:52.765 --> 08:56.098
If I give you information,
can I stay?

08:56.168 --> 08:57.795
We'II tell INS
you cooperated,

08:57.870 --> 08:59.360
if we Iike what we hear.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.074
Mrs. Todd,

09:04.143 --> 09:08.409
Katarina heard her
fight with her husband
the day before it happened.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.285
Mr. Todd,
how have you and your
wife been getting along?

09:17.356 --> 09:19.722
Fine.
We heard you had
a Iittle fight.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.886
Oh,
Katarina must have told you.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.260
The Iast few weeks,
I have spent so much time

09:25.331 --> 09:28.300
Iooking for the right Iocation
for this restaurant,

09:28.367 --> 09:31.200
interviewing managers,
vendors.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.171
I told her that
as soon as we got
this place up and running,

09:34.240 --> 09:38.006
we would have more
time for each other,
and she understood.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.669
Yeah, we have to
ask you this question.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.213
Were you and your wife
intimate before the attack?

09:44.650 --> 09:45.912
The night before. Why?

09:45.985 --> 09:48.886
We'd Iike you to agree
to a simple DNA test.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.947
Oh, is the husband
always a suspect?

09:52.024 --> 09:53.924
It's so the Iab
can differentiate

09:53.993 --> 09:56.791
your residual DNA
from the attacker's.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.523
The test is really
for your protection.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.498
You just tell me
where and when.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.965
(RINGING)

10:02.034 --> 10:03.433
Excuse me.

10:03.502 --> 10:04.867
Hello?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.370
It's nice to know
I'm not the only one

10:06.439 --> 10:08.873
catching grief
for working all the time.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.067
Thank God.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.200
Your wife?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.837
It was the hospital.
She's conscious.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.211
Excuse me.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.650
STABLER: Can she talk?
TODD: No.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.246
But the hospital
gave us a dry erase board

10:24.323 --> 10:26.188
so she could
write everything down.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.321
BENSON: Mrs. Todd,

10:29.128 --> 10:31.494
do you remember me
from the night of
your attack?

10:32.198 --> 10:33.222
(MOANING)

10:33.299 --> 10:34.561
STABLER: We're the police.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.569
Is there anything you can
remember about what happened?

10:43.609 --> 10:44.871
TODD: "Put on robe"'

10:46.145 --> 10:47.635
"Thought Ed"'

10:47.713 --> 10:49.340
You thought I was home?

10:49.415 --> 10:52.907
Why, Mrs. Todd?
What made you think
your husband was home?

10:54.286 --> 10:56.220
TODD: "Heard"'

10:57.456 --> 11:00.755
"Heard key in door"'

11:02.728 --> 11:04.992
She heard the key
in the door.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.526
TREVOR: The only way to
tell if a Iock's been picked

11:08.601 --> 11:11.229
is if the perp forgot to
turn the cylinder back.

11:11.303 --> 11:14.170
The Todd's front doorknob
Iocks automatically
when the door closes.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.537
STABLER:
So there's no way to tell.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.371
If it was picked,
your guy's a pro.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.001
No help there.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.675
This should be.

11:22.748 --> 11:25.444
Computer came up
with a match on the DNA
we found in Jessica Todd.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.509
We have a suspect?
Another victim.

11:27.586 --> 11:30.248
Rape-burglary two weeks ago,
Brooklyn Heights.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.321
My wife told the other
detectives everything.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.663
STABLER: We're sorry to make
you go through this again,
Mrs. Johansen,

11:42.735 --> 11:44.259
but whoever attacked you

11:44.336 --> 11:47.396
Ieft another victim
in Manhattan unable
to walk or talk.

11:48.007 --> 11:52.171
Anything you can remember
might help us get this guy
off the street.

11:56.315 --> 11:57.839
Curtis was out of town.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.817
A merger meeting
in Saint Louis.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.117
I was in the bedroom reading
when I heard a noise.

12:04.190 --> 12:07.159
I Iooked up
and there was a man
standing in the door.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.660
It says on the report that
you couldn't describe him.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.289
I told the detectives
I didn't see his face.

12:12.364 --> 12:16.198
He was wearing
a stocking over his head.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.600
BENSON: Do you remember
what else he was wearing?

12:21.307 --> 12:24.037
Regular clothes.
Jeans, maybe sneakers.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.777
And gloves.
Did he say anything?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.914
When I started to scream,

12:35.788 --> 12:37.915
he put a gun to my head,
and he...

12:38.924 --> 12:41.484
He told me he'd kill me
if I didn't stop.

12:44.296 --> 12:48.392
There was no emotion
in his voice.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.328
He just told me to

12:52.571 --> 12:54.129
take off my clothes.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.273
Then he...

13:06.118 --> 13:08.245
He didn't say another word.

13:11.824 --> 13:14.691
When he was done,
he went out the front door.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.259
And he in no way
tried to hit you?

13:19.832 --> 13:22.323
Isn't what he did to me
enough?

13:22.401 --> 13:25.666
Mrs. Johansen, think hard.

13:26.105 --> 13:29.097
Are you sure that you
didn't hear him come in?

13:30.709 --> 13:31.903
No.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.502
STABLER:
You told the other detectives

13:34.580 --> 13:37.310
the attacker stole
a diamond bracelet worth

13:38.484 --> 13:40.611
$100,000. Is that accurate?

13:40.686 --> 13:44.178
Two-carat stones
all the way around.
I had it made for Denise.

13:44.256 --> 13:47.225
I just gave it to her
for our six-month anniversary.

13:47.293 --> 13:50.820
Mrs. Johansen, is it possible
you Ieft the front door
unlocked or open?

13:50.896 --> 13:54.923
Our security system chirps
if the door is Ieft open
for more than 30 seconds.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.492
And the new doorknob
Iocks automatically.

13:59.471 --> 14:00.961
New doorknob?

14:01.874 --> 14:05.366
We had the Iocks replaced
about a month ago.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.172
I Iost my keys.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.214
We didn't want
to take any chances.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.378
STABLER: Do you have
the name of that Iocksmith?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.882
Parks Safe and Security,
Manhattan.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.654
I checked the computer.
We did both jobs.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.923
Same Iocksmith?
Yeah, Danny Ryan,
he's one of my best.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.554
What is this about?

14:25.631 --> 14:27.462
Are all your
employees bonded?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.831
Yeah. Fingerprints and
thorough background checks.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.631
The whole works.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.535
You wanna tell me
what's going on here?

14:33.606 --> 14:35.301
It's just part of
an investigation.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.342
Where could we find Ryan
right now?

14:37.409 --> 14:38.876
Well, he's out on a job.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.976
58 and Broadway.

14:46.085 --> 14:48.645
Monday night?
I was studying
in the Iibrary

14:48.721 --> 14:50.916
at the Jefferson College
of Criminal Justice.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.958
You coming to
the Police Department?

14:53.025 --> 14:54.720
Actually,
I'm shooting for Iaw school.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.988
I'm a Iocksmith
during the day,
go to school at night.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.587
Anybody see you
cracking the books
in the Iibrary?

14:59.665 --> 15:02.532
The woman at the front desk
when I showed her my ID.

15:02.601 --> 15:03.659
I didn't talk to anybody.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.398
I mean, I go there
to study, not socialize.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.463
How about two weeks ago
Iast night?

15:08.540 --> 15:09.632
Are you kidding me?

15:09.708 --> 15:12.233
I can't even remember
what I had for breakfast
this morning.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.575
What do you say
you try a Iittle harder?

15:14.647 --> 15:18.242
Look, any one of us
would be crazy to break
into a customer's house.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.309
I mean, they checked me
out for criminal record,
bad credit,

15:21.387 --> 15:23.685
everything, before
they Iet me do this job.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.781
Look, I put the Iocks
into those two brownstones,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.223
but I never went back.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.560
The DNA on Edwin Todd is in.
He's clear. It's not a match.

15:32.631 --> 15:33.962
What about Ryan?

15:34.033 --> 15:36.297
No rap sheet,
not even a speeding ticket.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.563
Benson.
We canvassed the Iibrary
at Jefferson.

15:38.637 --> 15:40.832
Guard doesn't remember Ryan
checking in Monday night.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.669
Maybe that's
because the Iab
just found his prints

15:42.741 --> 15:45.175
at both the Todd
and Johansen crime scenes.

15:45.244 --> 15:49.146
That doesn't help us unless
they found them somewhere
other than the front door.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.511
Yeah, how about
both front doors,

15:50.582 --> 15:53.016
plus the Todd's kitchen
and the Johansen's bedroom?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.677
Go pick him up.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.688
I told you,
I don't wear rubber gloves
when I install Iocks.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.280
Of course my prints
were in both houses.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.486
BENSON: Denise Johansen
was raped in her bedroom.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.428
Your prints were also
found in her bedroom.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.328
That's a Iong way
from the front door, Danny.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.889
The place in Brooklyn Heights?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.230
The Iady asked me
to take a Iook

16:10.302 --> 16:12.065
at the Iockset
in the master bath.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.332
Said it was sticking.
I fixed it for her.

16:14.406 --> 16:18.843
Guy Iike you, good-Iooking
women alone in their houses,

16:18.911 --> 16:20.970
they must come on to you
all the time, right?

16:21.046 --> 16:23.810
It happens,
but I'm not into that.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.075
She make a move on you?

16:26.151 --> 16:28.551
I'm telling you, no.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.053
I didn't make a move on her,
either.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.113
BENSON: Well, what about
when you did the Todd's house?

16:32.191 --> 16:34.819
Hey, she wasn't even there!
Just the husband was home.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.885
She was raped
and nearly beaten
to death in her kitchen.

16:37.963 --> 16:41.126
Again, your prints
found all over the place.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.929
Were you fixing
a Iock in there, too?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.526
I was thirsty.

16:44.603 --> 16:45.934
I asked for a glass of water.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.166
I had it in the kitchen.
Just ask him.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.765
You can count on that.
Now, what did you do
with the Rolex

16:50.843 --> 16:52.674
and the diamond bracelet
you stole from those houses?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.940
Hey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.108
But I swear,
I didn't rape
or beat anybody.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.576
I'm trying to
become a Iawyer.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.781
Why would I ruin my Iife?

17:05.523 --> 17:08.755
He'd make a good Iawyer.
He's got an answer
for everything.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.886
I wish it was that easy.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.522
We're bringing
the victims in
for a Iineup.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.757
Cancel it.
Why?

17:16.167 --> 17:18.465
Neither of them saw
their attackers' faces.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.595
We've heard that before.

17:19.671 --> 17:20.898
Then they come in,
Iook at the Iineup

17:20.973 --> 17:22.873
and remember
more than they thought.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.432
And when the victims
can't ID Ryan
and we take him to trial,

17:25.511 --> 17:27.502
it's exculpatory evidence
and he walks.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.807
Well, he's gonna walk
a Iot sooner

17:28.881 --> 17:31.315
if we don't come up
with a reason to hold him.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.214
Jessica Todd
barely survived.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.378
His next victim
may not be so Iucky.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.922
Fingerprints should be
enough to get warrants

17:38.991 --> 17:41.391
for Ryan's DNA
and his apartment.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.390
STABLER:
No watch or bracelet.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.193
That was a waste of time.

17:47.266 --> 17:48.528
If Ryan fenced that jewelry,

17:48.600 --> 17:50.192
you couldn't tell
from that dump.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.464
No keys. No mask.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.267
And he doesn't
have a car.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.043
Where else could he be
hiding that stash?

17:59.545 --> 18:00.842
You're wrong about Ryan.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.074
I told those
other detectives,
he's a good kid.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.343
So help us clear him.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.544
This is unit three.
This is the one
he drives.

18:07.619 --> 18:08.813
Is this his alone?

18:08.887 --> 18:10.946
Well, 8:00 to 4:00.
Two other guys drive it.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.786
4:00 to midnight,
and graveyard shift.

18:12.858 --> 18:13.950
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

18:14.026 --> 18:16.051
Yeah. We need you to

18:16.128 --> 18:19.029
sign this affidavit
giving us permission
to search the vehicle.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.292
Yeah. Knock yourselves out.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.026
You're not gonna
find anything.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.769
Great. Thank you.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.203
I'II take the front.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.539
STABLER: Here we go.
BENSON: What you got?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.477
Ryan's toolbox.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.174
Find anything inside?
Tools.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.649
Good. Well,
I've got coffee cups,

18:42.488 --> 18:44.888
candy wrappers,
half-eaten sandwich.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.322
They should
really think about

18:46.391 --> 18:48.291
cleaning this place out
once every two years.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.225
OIivia.
What?

18:51.096 --> 18:52.222
Panty hose.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.823
That's not something
you install a Iock with.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.596
Neither are these.

19:03.742 --> 19:07.007
CLERK: "Number 423154:
People v, Daniel Ryan,

19:07.079 --> 19:09.013
"Two counts Rape
in the First Degree.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.878
"One count Attempted Murder
in the Second Degree.

19:10.949 --> 19:12.974
"Two counts Grand Larceny"'

19:13.352 --> 19:15.547
The defendant's plea,
Miss Emerson?

19:15.621 --> 19:16.918
Not guilty.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.583
I'II take that to mean
on all charges.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.592
What can I do
for the People today?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.389
Given the violent nature
of the crimes,

19:23.462 --> 19:26.260
we request the defendant
be remanded without bail.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.128
JUDGE: This isn't
a murder case, Miss Cabot.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.566
One of the victims
may not walk or talk
normally again

19:30.636 --> 19:32.661
because of the beating
she took from Mr. Ryan.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.706
My client has no previous
criminal history, Judge.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.434
He's not a flight risk.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.941
CABOT: Mr. Ryan
installed the Iocks

19:38.010 --> 19:39.307
on both of the homes
of the victims

19:39.378 --> 19:40.709
and made duplicate keys.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.610
There could be
more keys out there
that we don't know about.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.615
He is a risk on the street.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.618
It's his first offense
so I'm not going to remand,

19:47.686 --> 19:48.914
but I agree with you.

19:48.987 --> 19:52.514
Bail is set at $500,000,
cash only.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.219
Ten minute break
until the next case.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.722
Half a million?
I can barely make my tuition.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.390
Don't worry, I'II have
you out by tomorrow.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.260
That's optimistic.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.825
Your detectives
blew their search.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.666
Not Iikely.
They had permission.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.603
From the wrong person.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.807
So he bought the tools
and toolbox himself.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.941
I don't see the problem.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.746
People v, Cacioppo,
Your Honor.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.548
Mr. Ryan Iacks the standing
to make the motion

20:22.621 --> 20:23.713
because he Ieft
his belongings

20:23.789 --> 20:25.347
in a vehicle
belonging to
someone else.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.619
With whom he had
a business relationship.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.717
People v, Laws,

20:28.794 --> 20:30.227
My client's work ID badge

20:30.295 --> 20:31.728
was clipped
to the toolbox handle,

20:31.797 --> 20:33.094
and the police
should have checked

20:33.165 --> 20:35.190
whether the toolbox
belonged to him.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.292
Sounds Iike the police
acted in good faith.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.099
Your Honor,
if I get permission
from the owner of a company

20:40.172 --> 20:41.298
to search an employee's
office,

20:41.373 --> 20:42.897
I still can't
open up a Iocked desk

20:42.975 --> 20:44.670
even if that desk
is company property.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.507
A vehicle is different.
People v, Keegan,

20:47.579 --> 20:49.672
Put your personal property
in someone else's car

20:49.748 --> 20:51.045
without a precaution
to safeguard it,

20:51.116 --> 20:53.914
there is no reasonable
expectation of privacy.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.112
Miss Emerson,

20:55.187 --> 20:58.486
if your client had put
a $5 Iock on his toolbox,

20:58.557 --> 20:59.649
we'd be out of here.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.556
There were no exigent
circumstances.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.753
What would
have been the harm

21:02.828 --> 21:04.125
if the police had come
to Your Honor

21:04.196 --> 21:05.424
and asked
for a search warrant

21:05.497 --> 21:08.796
before they opened
Mr. Ryan's personal property?

21:08.867 --> 21:09.834
Miss Cabot?

21:09.901 --> 21:11.994
We had ample probable cause
for a warrant.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.402
Which I never had
the chance to scrutinize.

21:14.473 --> 21:15.599
Your Honor...

21:15.674 --> 21:17.972
I'm going to err
on the side of caution.

21:18.043 --> 21:20.773
The evidence inside
the toolbox is out.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.948
Why didn't anyone call me?

21:24.016 --> 21:26.007
To tell you that
we had permission
to search the van?

21:26.084 --> 21:27.346
Would you have stopped us?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.250
CRAGEN: Let's stop
throwing blame around.

21:29.321 --> 21:31.414
We got screwed
by Iegal maneuvering.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.821
We still have
Ryan's fingerprints

21:32.891 --> 21:34.290
and his DNA is not back yet.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.657
Anyone besides me
got a problem
with any of this?

21:36.728 --> 21:37.820
CRAGEN: What are you saying?

21:37.896 --> 21:41.388
Well, those Iocksmith vans
run 24 hours a day.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.027
Why would Ryan put
$135,000 worth of jewelry

21:45.103 --> 21:47.435
in a place he knew
someone else could
find it?

21:47.506 --> 21:49.133
'Cause it wasn't Ryan.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.665
DNA?

21:50.742 --> 21:52.733
FIN: Report's back.
It's not his.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.278
He didn't rape Jessica Todd,

21:54.346 --> 21:56.177
Denise Johansen
or anybody else.

21:56.248 --> 21:59.081
Which means someone went to
a hell of a Iot of trouble
to set him up.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.985
Maybe whoever planted
the evidence Ieft prints
on Ryan's toolbox.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.579
AIong with the other two men
who drive the truck

22:04.656 --> 22:06.783
and God knows who else.
Same problem.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.325
Well, I think
it's worth a shot.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.951
How fast can you
spring Ryan?

22:10.629 --> 22:12.790
I can have him in court
by tomorrow morning.

22:12.864 --> 22:15.389
Toolbox is
still in our custody
at the property clerk.

22:15.467 --> 22:19.403
We need the Iab to dust it
and everything inside
for prints.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.031
Be sure you get Ryan's
permission this time.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.639
No way.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.836
I wouldn't even be in here
if it weren't for you people.

22:25.911 --> 22:28.209
We're gonna have you
out of here within the hour.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.474
I don't believe you.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.879
Look, man,
somebody set you up.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.110
We busted you, which means
we got set up, too.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.880
Don't you
want to find out
who did this to you?

22:34.953 --> 22:36.250
FIN:
Anybody got a beef with you?

22:36.321 --> 22:37.948
Work, friends, family?

22:38.023 --> 22:39.388
No.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.857
I mind my own business.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.019
Anybody at work
talk about Ieaving,

22:43.095 --> 22:45.996
going on to something else,
maybe coming into some money?

22:46.064 --> 22:47.622
Most of the guys are Iifers.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.893
Only one talking
about getting out is me.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.500
I give you permission
for the toolbox,

22:53.572 --> 22:55.233
you'II find out
who wanted me in here?

22:55.307 --> 22:57.241
It may be the only way.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.673
We found dozens of prints,
inside and out.

23:02.748 --> 23:03.840
The ones that
aren't Ryan's match

23:03.915 --> 23:06.247
seven other
bonded employees
of Parks Safe and Security.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.151
The judge is never gonna give
us warrants for all their DNA.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.156
You may not need it.
Let me show you something.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.286
STABLER:
Where's the partial from?

23:14.359 --> 23:16.224
One of the diamonds
on Denise Johansen's
bracelet.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.388
You found a surface
big enough to hold
a print?

23:19.464 --> 23:20.795
Those are two-carat diamonds,

23:20.866 --> 23:22.390
not enough surface
for a 10-point print,

23:22.467 --> 23:24.059
but I put the partial
into the computer,

23:24.136 --> 23:25.865
it spit out
a six-point match.

23:26.938 --> 23:30.465
Ed Todd's prints are on
Denise Johansen's bracelet.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.272
There's no way
Ed could've handled it
unless he knows the perp.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.006
Son of a bitch
must've hired someone

23:35.080 --> 23:36.980
to rape Denise
and his own wife.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.881
But a hired gun isn't
gonna be careless enough
to Ieave his DNA behind

23:39.951 --> 23:41.316
unless it's window dressing.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.549
Well, Iet's say
this hired gun rapes
Denise then Jessica.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.151
Now, he doesn't hit Denise,
but he beats Jessica
nearly to death.

23:47.225 --> 23:49.853
I mean, come on,
Ed Todd wants his wife dead.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.020
But not Denise,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.620
she doesn't have a scratch,
which means

23:52.697 --> 23:54.187
Denise has to be in on it.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.928
FIN: And the two of them
set up the Iocksmith
as fall guy.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.936
Attractive woman
in her 30s Iike Denise

23:59.004 --> 24:01.131
marries a 67-year-old CEO,

24:01.206 --> 24:03.470
it's gotta be for his money.
Why hook up with Todd?

24:03.542 --> 24:06.943
Well, Denise figures
that she and Todd,
they kill Jessica,

24:07.012 --> 24:08.946
she's gonna get rich
a hell of a Iot faster

24:09.014 --> 24:10.845
than waiting for
Curtis Johansen to die.

24:10.916 --> 24:14.408
And Todd probably thinks
he wiped that bracelet clean.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.113
Let's test him.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.490
It's not the Iocksmith?

24:19.791 --> 24:21.349
His DNA wasn't a match.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.291
He's still out there.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.192
Well, couldn't it
be somebody else

24:25.263 --> 24:26.662
from the Iocksmith company?

24:26.731 --> 24:29.063
Yeah,
we're checking into that.

24:29.768 --> 24:32.066
Do you remember touching
Ryan's toolbox?

24:33.338 --> 24:34.327
(COUGHING)

24:35.907 --> 24:37.397
Here, sweetie.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.439
The Iocksmith took
a bathroom break,

24:39.511 --> 24:40.842
and I borrowed
his screwdriver

24:40.912 --> 24:43.437
to tighten one of
the kitchen cabinet doors.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.483
Aside from the bathroom
and the entry foyer,

24:45.550 --> 24:47.848
was Ryan in any other
part of your house?

24:47.919 --> 24:49.386
No. Not that I remember.

24:49.454 --> 24:51.752
Why are you asking
these questions?

24:51.823 --> 24:54.485
Because they have to, honey.
That's their job.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.994
I am so sorry, but she had
a rough morning in rehab.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.158
We won't take up
any more of your time.

25:02.467 --> 25:03.934
Sorry to bother you.

25:06.705 --> 25:10.072
Now, did I see Todd blink
when I asked him about
that toolbox?

25:10.141 --> 25:12.166
Spooked him enough
to make him admit
that he touched it.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.474
And now he's saying Ryan
went to the bathroom.

25:14.546 --> 25:17.037
This guy
is telling so many Iies,
he can't keep them straight.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.605
I wonder which one
he told Jessica

25:18.683 --> 25:20.412
to get his hands
on her fortune.

25:21.119 --> 25:23.883
Let's check out
the source of the money.

25:27.092 --> 25:29.720
Jerry's estate was worth
about 10 million.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.228
He Ieft every cent
to Jessica.

25:32.297 --> 25:33.525
She was the Iove
of his Iife.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.065
She still have it?

25:35.133 --> 25:37.499
AII but 2.5 million.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.864
We just sold off
some stock for her.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.601
With the market
as Iow as it is now,
she must have taken a bath.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.666
Believe me, I tried
to talk her out of it.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.609
Especially when she said
that she was investing

25:47.679 --> 25:48.941
in her husband's
new restaurant.

25:49.014 --> 25:53.007
Yeah, now,
is it such a bad risk
with someone Iike Ed Todd?

25:53.084 --> 25:54.608
I mean,
he does have experience.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.983
Had a Iot of experience.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.749
Todd came to us
about two years ago

25:57.822 --> 26:00.723
Iooking to sell
his restaurant group
in Washington State.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.521
Jerry handled the deal.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.653
Todd said that
Mr. BIaine made him
quite a bit of money.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.061
After our cut,
about $35 million.

26:08.633 --> 26:10.999
I'm surprised
that he would want to
get back into the business.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.263
Especially here.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.463
Why is that?

26:13.538 --> 26:16.803
The city's economy
after September 11,

26:16.875 --> 26:18.740
you would have to
have Emeril himself

26:18.810 --> 26:21.210
running the place
in order to break even.

26:21.279 --> 26:23.338
And besides,
a guy Todd's age,

26:23.415 --> 26:26.907
with his money,
he should spend
his days playing golf.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.955
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

26:34.426 --> 26:35.415
What's up?

26:35.493 --> 26:37.222
We just spoke to Ed Todd.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.990
The real Edwin Todd.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.123
AIive and well?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.532
STABLER:
Seventy-two years young,
enjoying his retirement

26:44.603 --> 26:46.093
in his mansion
on Puget Sound

26:46.171 --> 26:47.570
just outside Seattle.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.834
Hasn't been to New York
since the mid-'80s.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.933
And he isn't married
to Jessica.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.749
I just talked to CSU.

27:02.220 --> 27:06.384
They say somebody SIim-Jimmed
open the driver's side door
of Ryan's van.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.823
Checking for prints now.

27:07.892 --> 27:10.258
That's not gonna help us
with the phony Edwin Todd.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.761
Ran that partial
from the bracelet,

27:11.830 --> 27:13.730
both State and Federal,
no hits.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.663
Todd has two bank accounts.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.828
One personal,
one for his company,
Culinary Equities.

27:18.903 --> 27:21.565
Combined balances,
148,000 and change.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.665
Well,
that doesn't sound Iike
enough to open a coffee shop,

27:23.742 --> 27:25.209
Iet alone
a high-end restaurant.

27:25.276 --> 27:28.177
Well, he had more,
but not much more.

27:28.246 --> 27:30.441
Todd paid first
and Iast months' rent,

27:30.515 --> 27:32.244
plus two months'
security for the space.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.807
Total, 40,000.

27:33.885 --> 27:36.649
AIso wrote another
160,000 in checks

27:36.721 --> 27:39.622
to vendors, food,
restaurant equipment,
furniture.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.921
Problem is,
we've been trying
to call these vendors.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.153
We can't find them.

27:43.228 --> 27:44.627
And Jessica Todd's account?

27:44.696 --> 27:48.132
She deposited the 2.5 million
from her stock sale Iast week.

27:48.199 --> 27:51.566
Then put a check
for $200,000 to
Culinary Equities.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.570
Explains why fake Todd
hasn't taken off.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.037
He doesn't have
all the money in.

27:55.106 --> 27:58.701
Is there any
solid connection between
him and Denise Johansen?

27:58.777 --> 28:01.405
Well, Todd made
cell phone calls to
an apartment in the Village.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.539
The same Village number
was dialed regularly
from a pay phone

28:04.616 --> 28:07.585
right down the block from
where the Johansen's Iive.

28:07.652 --> 28:10.746
Fin and I will
check out the apartment.
You two pay Mrs. Todd a visit.

28:10.822 --> 28:13.655
I think it's time
she got a reality check.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.962
JESSICA: Well,
Edwin's been wonderful.

28:20.598 --> 28:23.123
He's spent
almost all his time
here since this happened.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.395
(CLEARING THROAT)

28:24.469 --> 28:27.905
I don't know
how he's going to open
his restaurant on schedule.

28:27.972 --> 28:29.530
And how much money have
you given your husband

28:29.607 --> 28:30.938
so far for the restaurant?

28:31.009 --> 28:32.567
$200,000.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.669
Did he say when he needs
the rest of the money?

28:34.746 --> 28:36.907
Next week.
What are you getting at?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.674
Mrs. Todd,
we believe your husband

28:39.751 --> 28:41.844
has been planning
for some time now

28:43.221 --> 28:45.121
(SIGHING)
to steal your money.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.216
We checked his bank accounts.

28:48.359 --> 28:50.327
The money you gave him
is gone.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.430
Well, of course it is.
He had to pay his vendors.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.990
Those checks were written
to dummy companies.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.729
They don't exist.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.906
I don't believe you.

29:07.879 --> 29:11.440
Does your husband have access
to any more of your money?

29:12.484 --> 29:15.976
When I die, he's the sole
beneficiary of my will.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.382
STABLER:
When did you sign that will?

29:18.456 --> 29:19.684
Two weeks ago.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.750
BENSON:
Before you were attacked.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.996
Was it your husband's idea?
No.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.922
It was mine.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.767
So, you see,
you're wrong about Edwin.

29:33.872 --> 29:35.772
How much will he get?

29:36.174 --> 29:38.335
Everything.
My entire estate.

29:38.877 --> 29:44.110
Mrs. Todd, your husband
sent someone to kill you
for your money.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.819
How can that be?

29:53.191 --> 29:55.352
I can't take care of myself.

29:56.928 --> 30:00.022
Edwin's waiting on me
hand and foot.

30:04.669 --> 30:06.660
He's changed my diaper.

30:09.607 --> 30:13.099
He wouldn't do that
if he didn't Iove me.

30:19.717 --> 30:20.911
CRAGEN: You recognize them?

30:20.985 --> 30:23.215
Sure, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, 3B.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.153
Seen the Browns
around Iately?

30:25.223 --> 30:26.815
Nope, but that doesn't
mean anything.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.017
They keep weird hours.

30:28.092 --> 30:29.855
Salespeople, you know,
always on the road.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.225
Yeah. Thank you.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.720
So what's the plan, Captain?

30:33.798 --> 30:35.288
Call CSU for a search team.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.630
Make sure they send
a print tech
and the Photo Unit.

30:37.702 --> 30:40.262
I'II get Cabot
started on a warrant.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.398
Nothing in here.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.673
Anything in the bedroom?

30:45.743 --> 30:47.540
The closet and the dresser
are both empty.

30:47.612 --> 30:50.012
Some Iadies' thongs
in the bed sheets.

30:53.484 --> 30:55.714
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What you got?

30:55.787 --> 30:58.551
Looks Iike the Browns
forgot something.

30:58.623 --> 31:01.183
Canada West boarding pass
to Winnipeg,

31:01.559 --> 31:03.083
name of Edwin Todd.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.355
Dated Iast week.

31:04.429 --> 31:06.021
That's just before
Jessica was attacked.

31:06.097 --> 31:07.860
Let's call the Winnipeg
police.

31:07.932 --> 31:11.424
See if they can
help us find out
what Todd was doing there.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.801
Talked to the airlines.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.670
Todd, or whatever his name is,
took three trips to Winnipeg

31:16.741 --> 31:18.299
in the two weeks
before Jessica
was attacked.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.707
If he had a record
in Canada,

31:19.777 --> 31:22.143
explains why
we couldn't get
a hit on his prints.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.443
Call CSU,
have them overnight

31:24.515 --> 31:26.142
all the prints we found
in the apartment

31:26.217 --> 31:28.082
to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.

31:28.152 --> 31:29.676
Hey, we might get Iucky.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.221
We still got a problem
with the DNA.

31:31.289 --> 31:32.517
It's not Ryan or Todd's.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.023
If Denise faked
being attacked,

31:34.092 --> 31:35.559
how did she have
the DNA in her

31:35.627 --> 31:37.219
that showed up
on the rape kit?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.626
By having sex
with her husband.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.500
STABLER: She takes
the rest of his semen,

31:44.569 --> 31:45.729
plants it on Jessica,

31:45.803 --> 31:48.033
makes it Iook Iike
the same guy raped them both.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.198
Talk to Curtis Johansen.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.468
You want me to
take a DNA test?

31:54.545 --> 31:56.410
I feel Iike I should
be calling my attorney.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.574
You're not a suspect,
Mr. Johansen.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.379
In fact,
you might be a victim.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.418
I think you better tell me
what's going on here.

32:04.489 --> 32:05.922
Okay, before you Ieft
for your trip,

32:05.990 --> 32:07.719
were you and your wife
intimate?

32:08.159 --> 32:10.559
Sex is not Iacking
in our marriage,
Detective.

32:10.628 --> 32:12.152
Is this necessary?

32:12.230 --> 32:14.130
I'm afraid it is, yes.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.493
That afternoon.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.066
Denise called me
and told me

32:22.140 --> 32:24.631
she had a romantic
send-off planned,

32:24.709 --> 32:26.973
that I should come home early.

32:27.178 --> 32:29.703
When I got to the house,
we made Iove.

32:30.848 --> 32:33.009
What does any of this have
to do with her being raped?

32:33.084 --> 32:36.542
Your wife reported the rape
right after you Ieft,
Mr. Johansen.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.748
We think that she faked it.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.051
Why in the hell
would she do that?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.354
To cover up a crime.

32:43.428 --> 32:45.293
She planted your semen
on the other victim

32:45.363 --> 32:47.331
after almost
beating her to death.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.431
I don't believe any of this.
What proof do you have?

32:52.503 --> 32:54.266
STABLER: Well, your DNA test
will tell us for sure.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.204
She knew that
we wouldn't Iook
at you as a suspect

32:56.274 --> 32:57.935
because
you were out of town.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.235
My God.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.509
She set me up? Why?

33:04.015 --> 33:06.677
She's hooked up with a man
who calls himself Ed Todd.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.809
The restaurateur?

33:07.885 --> 33:08.874
Yes, do you know him?

33:08.953 --> 33:13.117
Do I know him?
I've committed $250,000
to his restaurant project.

33:14.659 --> 33:15.887
Denise's idea.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.951
That's their game,
Mr. Johansen.

33:18.029 --> 33:20.224
They want to steal your money.

33:20.298 --> 33:23.461
I don't go into
a business venture
half-cocked.

33:23.534 --> 33:24.694
I've seen the Iocation.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.259
I've been over
the business plan,

33:26.337 --> 33:27.964
met most of the other
investors,

33:28.039 --> 33:30.098
including Todd's wife.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.074
The other rape victim.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.141
STABLER: Labs are back.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.546
BENSON: It's Curtis Johansen's
DNA in both women.

33:40.084 --> 33:42.882
So Jessica was signing
her own death sentence

33:42.954 --> 33:45.582
when she made out that will
Ieaving everything to Todd.

33:45.656 --> 33:48.318
We gotta pick him and Denise
up before they carry it out.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.417
You know that's a problem.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.621
That partial print proves
this is Todd all the way.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.788
Proves it to us.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.263
It's only
six points of similarity.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.458
It's useless in court.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.195
Well, this won't be.
RCMP came through.

33:58.269 --> 34:01.670
Todd's real name
is Edward Crandall,
formerly of Toronto.

34:01.739 --> 34:04.435
Did three years in Kingston
Penitentiary for fraud.

34:04.509 --> 34:05.601
What about Denise?

34:05.676 --> 34:08.543
CRAGEN:
Real name is Denise Cormier,

34:08.612 --> 34:10.638
born in Quebec,
arrested with Crandall

34:10.715 --> 34:12.909
and did her time
in Maplehurst.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.282
Where do Jessica and Curtis
stand on cooperating?

34:15.353 --> 34:18.288
Johansen is on board.
Jessica won't believe it.

34:18.356 --> 34:21.223
Well, we're gonna
have to change her mind.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.327
JESSICA: What's this?

34:24.929 --> 34:26.293
What are you showing me?

34:26.364 --> 34:29.993
Your husband.
He has a prison record
in Canada for fraud.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.203
You're trying to trick me.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.533
Sorry, Mrs. Todd,

34:35.840 --> 34:37.170
but it's the truth.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.572
This woman

34:39.777 --> 34:41.301
is his partner.

34:42.112 --> 34:45.708
We think she attacked you,
staged your rape and her own.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.384
Take me back to the hospital.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.585
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.781
You should see these first.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.418
What's this place?

34:55.059 --> 34:57.960
They share an apartment
together in the Village.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.997
Both of their prints
were found there.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.598
Edwin's been so good for me.

35:11.976 --> 35:13.500
I trusted him.

35:14.712 --> 35:18.671
I never thought
I'd get married again,
and then Edwin came along.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.749
Then a few months
after Jerry died,

35:22.820 --> 35:25.050
Edwin called,
said he was in town,

35:25.590 --> 35:27.888
asked if he might
take me out to dinner.

35:30.928 --> 35:33.419
Well, he said
all the right things.

35:35.166 --> 35:39.068
Told me I was beautiful,

35:40.438 --> 35:42.235
Jerry was a Iucky man.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.841
He said

35:48.012 --> 35:51.504
he knew he could
never take Jerry's place.

35:53.217 --> 35:56.709
Oh, but I'd already begun
to fall in Iove with him.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.990
And when he asked me
to marry him,

36:01.292 --> 36:03.055
I said yes.

36:04.295 --> 36:05.523
Mrs. Todd,

36:05.930 --> 36:07.454
if you help us,

36:07.532 --> 36:09.500
we will make him
pay for this.

36:12.470 --> 36:13.732
I can't.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.562
Why not?

36:17.775 --> 36:21.506
Edwin confessed to me
Iast night.

36:23.681 --> 36:26.445
He told me everything,
the whole scheme.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.213
He asked me to forgive him,

36:33.724 --> 36:35.089
and I did.

36:38.262 --> 36:41.754
Edwin and his partner
put you in that wheelchair.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.595
JESSICA: He never
meant for this to happen.

36:43.668 --> 36:48.332
He admitted he had had
an affair with that woman,

36:50.474 --> 36:51.964
but he said it was over.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.804
He said she beat me
out of jealousy.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.177
Mrs. Todd,
they're in this together.

36:58.249 --> 37:01.650
This is not about jealousy.
This is not about Iove.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.586
This is about
stealing your money.

37:04.655 --> 37:05.747
And if you don't help us,

37:05.823 --> 37:07.654
they're gonna
get away with it.

37:11.896 --> 37:15.388
Edwin's Iawyer called me
this morning.

37:16.033 --> 37:20.060
He said I could never testify
about what Edwin had told me

37:20.838 --> 37:23.329
because I'm his wife.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.705
I feel so stupid.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.746
BENSON: Curtis Johansen
got the same phone call from
Denise's attorney this morning

37:37.822 --> 37:39.551
after she confessed
to him Iast night.

37:39.624 --> 37:42.149
Protected themselves
by marrying their victims.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.523
These two are real pieces
of work.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.391
Tied our hands
and our victims'.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.193
CABOT: And we can't
prove any of it
beyond a reasonable doubt.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.666
What about Curtis Johansen's
DNA?

37:50.735 --> 37:52.066
Put that to a jury,
and they'II think

37:52.136 --> 37:53.763
Johansen raped
Jessica and Denise

37:53.838 --> 37:55.135
even though he has an alibi.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.798
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.

37:56.874 --> 38:00.173
We have battered wives
testify against the husbands
who beat them all the time.

38:00.244 --> 38:01.370
How is this different?

38:01.445 --> 38:04.141
Those women testified about
what their husbands did,

38:04.215 --> 38:05.546
not what they said.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.210
Those wives
still cannot reveal
confidential communication

38:08.286 --> 38:10.345
between themselves
and their husbands.

38:10.421 --> 38:13.049
Well, there's got to be
a Ioophole for a situation
Iike this.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.457
I checked the case Iaw.
There has never been
a situation Iike this.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.724
What is it?
Marriage Iicenses.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.830
Edwin Todd
to Jessica BIaine.

38:25.736 --> 38:28.227
Curtis Johansen
to Denise Carlson.

38:30.441 --> 38:31.999
Thought her name was Cormier.

38:34.178 --> 38:36.476
Pick up Todd and Denise.
For what?

38:36.547 --> 38:40.745
False names
on their marriage Iicenses.
They finally made a mistake.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.052
Are you kidding me
with this charge?

38:45.122 --> 38:46.919
Don't you worry. We got
better ones on the way.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.357
I don't see how.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.952
You really think
you can get away with this?

38:52.029 --> 38:55.521
You don't have to use that
tone with me, Detective.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.600
STABLER: Your real name
is Denise Cormier.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.796
So what?

39:01.339 --> 39:03.102
Well, on the certificate
of marriage,

39:03.174 --> 39:05.165
it says Denise Carlson.

39:05.242 --> 39:07.369
Where are you going
with this?

39:08.913 --> 39:10.608
Your client Iied
about her name.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.209
And because you Iied,

39:15.453 --> 39:17.717
your marriage to
Jessica BIaine is void.

39:18.789 --> 39:22.555
PIease, how many times do
I have to tell you about
your tone of voice?

39:22.626 --> 39:24.287
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.389
If my manners bother you,
Iet me use your real name
for this.

39:28.466 --> 39:33.096
Edward Crandall,
you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder,

39:33.170 --> 39:36.833
attempted murder,
robbery and grand Iarceny.

39:36.907 --> 39:40.604
If you're going
to use his real name,
you better use Edwin Todd.

39:40.678 --> 39:42.043
Excuse me?

39:51.756 --> 39:55.453
What's this?
Mrs. Johansen's
Iegal name change

39:55.526 --> 39:59.895
to Denise Carlson before
she married Curtis Johansen.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.964
It's Canadian.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.829
How do I know
it's not a forgery?

40:06.036 --> 40:07.469
Because that's a copy
we ordered from

40:07.538 --> 40:08.903
the Registrar of Records
in Winnipeg,

40:08.973 --> 40:10.838
where the original is on file.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.432
Note the seal at the bottom.

40:14.712 --> 40:17.875
So why'd you change
your name, Edwin?

40:19.116 --> 40:20.310
Don't answer that.

40:20.384 --> 40:21.908
Oh, come on,
what's the harm?

40:21.986 --> 40:24.978
Sorry.
I'm gonna have to go
with my Iawyer on that one.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.425
How we doing?
FIN: We found the money,

40:31.495 --> 40:33.622
courtesy of our friends
at the RCMP.

40:33.697 --> 40:35.892
Five accounts
in Winnipeg Crown Bank

40:35.966 --> 40:38.764
under the names
of the vendors that
Todd wrote the checks to.

40:38.836 --> 40:40.736
He's the signatory
on all the accounts.

40:40.805 --> 40:43.330
Waited for
the checks to clear,
then made cash withdrawals,

40:43.407 --> 40:45.637
Ieaving each account
with $1,000.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.542
So he gets the money
out of the country,
then converts it to cash

40:48.612 --> 40:50.637
so we can't trace it
any further.

40:50.714 --> 40:52.909
This guy is good.
Now what about Denise?

40:52.983 --> 40:56.714
Well, I can't find
any accounts in her names,
but the RCMP is still Iooking.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.846
I put a uniform detail
on Jessica,

40:58.923 --> 41:00.015
just to be on the safe side.

41:00.090 --> 41:02.058
AIso got one
on Todd and Denise

41:02.126 --> 41:03.559
in case they decide
to cut their Iosses

41:03.627 --> 41:04.889
and run back to Canada.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.259
What the hell's this mean?

41:06.330 --> 41:08.161
STABLER: What do you got?
It's a credit card
statement

41:08.232 --> 41:09.790
in the name
of Edward Crandall.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.335
Some hotel in Acapulco
a year and a half ago.

41:12.403 --> 41:13.529
It's in Spanish.

41:13.604 --> 41:16.437
Well, resorts are a great
place to pick up a mark.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.165
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

41:20.511 --> 41:22.479
"Luna de miel"
means "honeymoon"'

41:22.880 --> 41:24.609
Son of a bitch.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.373
Why would Ed and Denise
be staying

41:26.450 --> 41:28.418
in the honeymoon suite
of that hotel?

41:30.721 --> 41:33.451
We're not going to allow
the continued harassment
of our clients.

41:33.524 --> 41:35.389
Why are we here?

41:35.459 --> 41:36.983
The honeymoon's over.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.852
What does that mean?

41:40.798 --> 41:43.767
It's in Spanish.
You want to clue us in?

41:43.834 --> 41:47.326
Yeah, it's your clients'
Mexican marriage Iicense.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.435
I told you we should
have gotten a divorce.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.500
Shut up, you stupid bitch.

41:53.577 --> 41:57.206
You see,
this is the Iast time
I'm gonna take care of you.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.781
It was all his idea.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.784
And they can't
prove any of it

42:01.852 --> 42:03.649
if you keep
your trap shut.

42:04.588 --> 42:05.612
What's the matter,
Counselors,

42:05.689 --> 42:08.522
you didn't know
they were married
to each other?

42:08.592 --> 42:10.287
CABOT: Unless you can produce
divorce papers

42:10.361 --> 42:11.919
preceding your clients'
respective weddings

42:11.996 --> 42:14.123
to Jessica BIaine
and Curtis Johansen,

42:14.198 --> 42:16.257
it's as if those marriages
never existed.

42:16.333 --> 42:17.527
No. Jessica needs me.

42:17.601 --> 42:18.898
You see,
I do everything for her.

42:18.969 --> 42:21.267
She's not going to
testify against me.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.712
Mrs. BIaine.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.041
No.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.114
Her Iast name is Todd.

42:37.187 --> 42:38.814
Now you know my wife is ill.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.490
You have no right
to bring her here.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.022
Hi, sweetie,
you should be resting.

42:48.465 --> 42:50.330
Sit down, you bastard.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.468
You know what?
This was all a mistake.

42:55.539 --> 42:59.635
Yes, I stole your money.
She was only supposed
to take your watch.

42:59.710 --> 43:02.235
You weren't supposed to
get hurt.

43:05.549 --> 43:06.811
You're upset.

43:07.351 --> 43:11.185
We need to get away,
just you and me, huh?

43:11.255 --> 43:13.382
Anywhere you want to go.

43:15.659 --> 43:18.389
The only place
you're going is to hell.
