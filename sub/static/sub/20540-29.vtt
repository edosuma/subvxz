00:33.166 --> 00:35.333
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:35.333 --> 00:37.133
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.133 --> 00:37.500
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.500 --> 00:37.934
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.934 --> 00:43.734
FOR JOINING US.

00:43.734 --> 00:47.133
OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE PEOPLE

00:47.133 --> 00:48.033
OF TEXAS FOLLOWING TODAY'S

00:48.033 --> 00:50.100
INCIDENT, DETAILS ARE STILL

00:50.100 --> 00:50.367
UNFOLDING.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.333
I AM SURE THERE WILL BE MORE TO

00:52.333 --> 00:53.934
SAY ABOUT THIS IN THE HOURS AND

00:53.934 --> 00:54.533
DAYS AHEAD.

00:54.533 --> 00:58.166
BUT FOR NOW, WE ARE GOING TO

00:58.166 --> 01:00.300
DIVE STRAIGHT IN WITH

01:00.300 --> 01:02.600
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

01:02.600 --> 01:08.500
STATUES OF WHOM WILL SOMEDAY BE

01:08.500 --> 01:08.967
LATER TAKEN DOWN AMID

01:08.967 --> 01:10.800
A STORM OF CONTROVERSY.

01:14.667 --> 01:15.433
INTERFERENCE IN THE AMERICAN

01:15.433 --> 01:17.266

01:17.266 --> 01:18.467
>> John: YES, IT'S FINALLY

01:18.467 --> 01:20.433
HAPPENING!

01:20.433 --> 01:22.600
THE FIRST CHARGES IN THE ONGOING

01:22.600 --> 01:23.500
SCANDAL WE'VE BEEN CALLING

01:23.500 --> 01:26.333
"STUPID WATERGATE."

01:26.333 --> 01:27.800
A STORY THAT, LIKE WATERGATE,

01:27.800 --> 01:28.467
COULD WELL END UP TOPPLING

01:28.467 --> 01:29.533
DEMOCRACY, BUT ONLY BECAUSE

01:29.533 --> 01:31.433
ONE OF THESE IDIOTS SLIPPED

01:31.433 --> 01:32.667
ON A BANANA PEEL, YELLED

01:32.667 --> 01:34.033
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE

01:34.033 --> 01:35.166
"UH-OH, SPAGHETTI-O!"

01:35.166 --> 01:35.867
AND ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED

01:35.867 --> 01:39.033
DEMOCRACY OVER.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.333
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT MONDAY'S

01:40.333 --> 01:41.567
CHARGES ONE AT A TIME, BECAUSE

01:41.567 --> 01:42.934
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

01:42.934 --> 01:44.767
LET'S START WITH PAUL MANAFORT,

01:44.767 --> 01:46.233
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN,

01:46.233 --> 01:46.800
AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER,

01:46.800 --> 01:49.367
RICK GATES.

01:49.367 --> 01:50.000
THE RAP SHEET AGAINST THEM

01:50.000 --> 01:51.433
IS IMPRESSIVE.

01:51.433 --> 01:52.667
>> THE 31-PAGE INDICTMENT

01:52.667 --> 01:54.166
CHARGES THAT OVER AT LEAST

01:54.166 --> 01:55.600
10 YEARS, THE TWO MEN SET UP

01:55.600 --> 01:56.967
A SCHEME TO HIDE TENS OF

01:56.967 --> 01:58.967
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCOME

01:58.967 --> 02:00.667
THEY RECEIVED FROM A PRO-RUSSIAN

02:00.667 --> 02:02.800
UKRAINIAN POLITICAL PARTY.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.133
PROSECUTORS ALLEGE THE SCHEME

02:04.133 --> 02:05.200
INVOLVED HIDING THAT FOREIGN

02:05.200 --> 02:06.467
WORK, FUNNELING MORE THAN

02:06.467 --> 02:08.767
$75 MILLION THROUGH UNREPORTED

02:08.767 --> 02:10.767
FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS,

02:10.767 --> 02:11.967
LAUNDERING TENS OF MILLIONS

02:11.967 --> 02:14.900
OF DOLLARS, AND LYING TO THE IRS

02:14.900 --> 02:17.000
AND TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

02:17.000 --> 02:17.867
>> John: WOW.

02:17.867 --> 02:20.266
THAT IS A LOT.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.734
AND TRUMP MUST BE FURIOUS

02:21.734 --> 02:22.633
WITH THEM, NOT SO MUCH FOR

02:22.633 --> 02:23.767
THE PART WHERE THEY ALLEGEDLY

02:23.767 --> 02:25.066
LIED TO THE GOVERNMENT,

02:25.066 --> 02:26.333
BUT FOR WHERE THEY PRETENDED TO

02:26.333 --> 02:28.233
HAVE LESS MONEY THAN THEY DID.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.867
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

02:29.867 --> 02:31.000
VIOLATES THE TENETS OF WHATEVER

02:31.000 --> 02:31.867
STICKY BACK-ISSUE OF

02:31.867 --> 02:33.166
"FUCKABLE YACHTS" MAGAZINE

02:33.166 --> 02:34.133
TRUMP CONSIDERS

02:34.133 --> 02:36.867
HIS CODE OF ETHICS.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.333
AND WHILE THEY DENY ALL CHARGES,

02:38.333 --> 02:39.700
THE DETAILS ARE DAMNING.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.000
BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO

02:41.000 --> 02:41.834
PROSECUTORS, NOT ALL THE MONEY

02:41.834 --> 02:42.400
WAS SQUIRRELED AWAY

02:42.400 --> 02:43.700
IN SHELL COMPANIES AND OVERSEAS

02:43.700 --> 02:45.033
BANK ACCOUNTS.

02:45.033 --> 02:46.233
SOME OF IT WAS USED

02:46.233 --> 02:48.100
TO GO SHOPPING.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.367
>> ACCORDING TO THE INDICTMENT,

02:49.367 --> 02:50.233
MANAFORT USED THE MONEY TO QUOTE

02:50.233 --> 02:52.533
"ENJOY A LAVISH LIFESTYLE,"

02:52.533 --> 02:53.200
SPENDING NEARLY

02:53.200 --> 02:53.967
A MILLION DOLLARS ON

02:53.967 --> 02:55.967
ANTIQUE RUGS AND MORE THAN

02:55.967 --> 02:59.467
1.3 MILLION ON FANCY CLOTHES.

02:59.467 --> 03:01.667
>> John: OVER $2 MILLION

03:01.667 --> 03:04.667
ON RUGS AND CLOTHES?

03:04.667 --> 03:05.934
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE QUALITY

03:05.934 --> 03:06.767
OF HIS RUGS, BUT HOW THE FUCK

03:06.767 --> 03:09.200
IS THIS GUY SPENDING THAT MUCH

03:09.200 --> 03:11.133
ON CLOTHING?

03:11.133 --> 03:14.433
HE LOOKS LIKE HE BOUGHT ALL THE

03:14.433 --> 03:15.433
SUITS HE WAS GOING TO WEAR FOR

03:15.433 --> 03:16.266
THE REST OF HIS LIFE ON ONE DAY

03:16.266 --> 03:17.500
IN 1982 WITH A CASHIER'S CHECK

03:17.500 --> 03:19.867
FOR $900.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.767
AND WHEN JOURNALISTS TRIED

03:20.767 --> 03:22.500
TO FIND OUT WHERE HE GOT HIS

03:22.500 --> 03:23.934
CLOTHES, CALLING A NUMBER

03:23.934 --> 03:25.567
OF HIGH-END BOUTIQUES,

03:25.567 --> 03:26.233
THEY GOT EITHER DENIALS

03:26.233 --> 03:27.934
OR "NO COMMENTS"

03:27.934 --> 03:29.433
FROM CANALI, ISAIA,

03:29.433 --> 03:31.000
HOUSE OF BIJAN,

03:31.000 --> 03:31.934
ZEGNA, AND BRIONI.

03:31.934 --> 03:33.266
WHICH IS A LITTLE SURPRISING,

03:33.266 --> 03:34.233
BECAUSE WHAT BRAND WOULDN'T

03:34.233 --> 03:36.233
WANT, AS ITS PUBLIC FACE,

03:36.233 --> 03:37.533
A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE AN EXTRA

03:37.533 --> 03:38.533
FROM A DIRECT-TO-DVD MOBSTER

03:38.533 --> 03:39.633
MOVIE WHO FELL ASLEEP

03:39.633 --> 03:42.367
IN A TANNING BED?

03:42.367 --> 03:43.400
BUT IF I MAY QUOTE

03:43.400 --> 03:44.934
THE TSA AGENT ASSIGNED TO

03:44.934 --> 03:46.333
INSPECT MARIAH CAREY'S CARRY ON,

03:46.333 --> 03:47.600
"LET'S SET ASIDE

03:47.600 --> 03:49.433
THE $1.3 MILLION IN CLOTHES

03:49.433 --> 03:51.700
FOR JUST A MINUTE."

03:51.700 --> 03:53.066
AND LET'S ASK THE QUESTION

03:53.066 --> 03:54.000
TRUMP ASKS HIMSELF EVERY MOMENT

03:54.000 --> 03:55.934
OF EVERY DAY:

03:55.934 --> 03:56.867
HOW DOES DONALD TRUMP

03:56.867 --> 03:59.033
FIT INTO THIS?

03:59.033 --> 04:01.166
WELL, TO HEAR HIM TELL IT,

04:01.166 --> 04:03.133
HE DOESN'T.

04:03.133 --> 04:03.667
>> THE PRESIDENT REVEALED

04:03.667 --> 04:05.600
HIS THOUGHTS IN TWO TWEETS.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.633
"SORRY, BUT THIS IS YEARS AGO

04:07.633 --> 04:09.400
BEFORE PAUL MANAFORT WAS PART OF

04:09.400 --> 04:11.166
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.000
BUT WHY AREN'T CROOKED HILLARY

04:12.000 --> 04:13.900
AND THE DEMS THE FOCUS?"

04:13.900 --> 04:15.600
ADDING ALSO "THERE IS NO

04:15.600 --> 04:17.667
COLLUSION," WRITING THAT LAST

04:17.667 --> 04:19.367
BIT IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.834
>> John: WOW.

04:21.834 --> 04:22.633
ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.433
I HAVEN'T SEEN SUCH A FORCEFUL

04:24.433 --> 04:25.600
DENIAL SINCE EVERY MEN'S

04:25.600 --> 04:26.166
CLOTHING STORE IN TWO MAJOR

04:26.166 --> 04:29.033
AMERICAN CITIES DENIED SUPPLYING

04:29.033 --> 04:29.700
MANAFORT WITH A CLOSETFUL OF

04:29.700 --> 04:30.967
BOXY, OFF-THE-RACK JACKETS FROM

04:30.967 --> 04:32.600
THE "DAD'S OPEN-CASKET FUNERAL"

04:32.600 --> 04:35.600
COLLECTION.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.800
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT TRUMP'S

04:37.800 --> 04:38.400
DEFENSE HERE, WHICH HE

04:38.400 --> 04:40.133
DEFINITELY HASN'T,

04:40.133 --> 04:41.734
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY STRANGE.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.133
HE'S ESSENTIALLY SAYING,

04:43.133 --> 04:44.367
"MANAFORT HAD ALREADY DONE

04:44.367 --> 04:46.333
ALL THIS STUFF AT THE TIME I,

04:46.333 --> 04:47.867
DONALD TRUMP, DECIDED TO HIRE

04:47.867 --> 04:51.233
HIM AS MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER."

04:51.233 --> 04:52.633
WHICH MEANS ONE OF TWO THINGS:

04:52.633 --> 04:53.767
EITHER TRUMP DID A BACKGROUND

04:53.767 --> 04:55.500
CHECK, DISCOVERED HIS SUSPICIOUS

04:55.500 --> 04:57.400
ACTIVITY, AND DIDN'T CARE.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.133
OR HE DIDN'T SO MUCH AS GOOGLE

04:59.133 --> 05:01.700
MANAFORT BEFORE HIRING HIM.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.934
BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS MANAFORT

05:03.934 --> 05:05.433
IS DODGY.

05:05.433 --> 05:06.367
HE'S REPRESENTED THE INTERESTS

05:06.367 --> 05:07.233
OF STRONGMEN AND DICTATORS

05:07.233 --> 05:08.567
AROUND THE WORLD,

05:08.567 --> 05:10.300
INCLUDING FERDINAND MARCOS,

05:10.300 --> 05:11.700
MOBUTU, VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH

05:11.700 --> 05:12.900
AND RUSSIAN OLIGARCH

05:12.900 --> 05:15.133
OLEG DERIPASKA, THE LAST TWO OF

05:15.133 --> 05:18.300
WHOM HAD CLOSE TIES TO PUTIN.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.233
IN FACT, IT'S SINCE COME TO

05:19.233 --> 05:20.033
LIGHT THAT MANAFORT MAY HAVE

05:20.033 --> 05:21.767
BEEN IN DEBT TO PRO-RUSSIA

05:21.767 --> 05:22.900
INTERESTS BY AS MUCH AS

05:22.900 --> 05:25.000
$17 MILLION.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.533
AND THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT HIM,

05:26.533 --> 05:28.900
THE SHADIER HE GETS.

05:28.900 --> 05:29.834
>> PROSECUTORS HAVE NOTED THAT

05:29.834 --> 05:31.066
MANAFORT HAS THREE U.S.

05:31.066 --> 05:33.633
PASSPORTS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS

05:33.633 --> 05:34.900
AND RECENTLY TRAVELED ABROAD

05:34.900 --> 05:37.100
WHILE USING A PHONE AND EMAIL

05:37.100 --> 05:41.333
REGISTERED UNDER AN ALIAS.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.567
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

05:42.567 --> 05:45.000
WHO OUTSIDE OF JASON BOURNE

05:45.000 --> 05:46.700
NEEDS THREE SEPARATE PASSPORTS

05:46.700 --> 05:47.767
AND AN ALIAS?

05:47.767 --> 05:48.967
BESIDES, OF COURSE,

05:48.967 --> 05:52.400
THE OLSEN TWIN.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.500
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT ONE FOR

05:53.500 --> 05:54.333
MARY-KATE,

05:54.333 --> 05:55.567
ONE FOR ASHLEY, AND ONE

05:55.567 --> 05:57.000
FOR HILARY DUFF.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.734
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THERE'S ALSO

05:58.734 --> 06:00.133
NO HILARY DUFF.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.700
IT'S JUST ONE OLSEN TWIN MOVING

06:01.700 --> 06:03.667
BACK AND FORTH VERY QUICKLY AND

06:03.667 --> 06:05.367
THEN CHANGING HER HAIR AND FACE

06:05.367 --> 06:06.433
SIGNIFICANTLY AND STANDING STILL

06:06.433 --> 06:07.834
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE.

06:07.834 --> 06:08.867
I'M CLOSE!

06:08.867 --> 06:13.633
I'M SO CLOSE!

06:13.633 --> 06:15.633
TO BLOWING THIS CHARADE APART.

06:15.633 --> 06:16.934
NOW, TRUMP HAS ARGUED

06:16.934 --> 06:17.900
MANAFORT WAS JUST WITH THE

06:17.900 --> 06:18.567
CAMPAIGN FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD

06:18.567 --> 06:20.900
OF TIME.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.233
BUT HE HELD TOP POSITIONS

06:22.233 --> 06:24.400
WITHIN IT FOR FIVE MONTHS,

06:24.400 --> 06:25.300
DURING WHICH TIME, HE NOT ONLY

06:25.300 --> 06:27.166
ORGANIZED THE CONVENTION,

06:27.166 --> 06:28.967
HE ALSO SPOKE ON THE CAMPAIGN'S

06:28.967 --> 06:29.767
BEHALF, WITH DECIDEDLY

06:29.767 --> 06:32.200
MIXED RESULTS.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.633
>> SO TO BE CLEAR, MR. TRUMP HAS

06:33.633 --> 06:35.800
NO FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH

06:35.800 --> 06:37.400
ANY RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.166
>> THAT -- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID

06:39.166 --> 06:41.300
AND THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.033
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE --

06:42.033 --> 06:44.467
OUR POSITION IS.

06:44.467 --> 06:46.266
>> John: WELL, THERE'S NOTHING

06:46.266 --> 06:47.367
INHERENTLY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THAT

06:47.367 --> 06:49.300
RESPONSE AT ALL, EXCEPT FOR

06:49.300 --> 06:50.767
THE SWEATINESS, THE STUMBLING,

06:50.767 --> 06:52.200
AND THE FACT YOU COULDN'T EVEN

06:52.200 --> 06:53.266
HOLD EYE CONTACT

06:53.266 --> 06:56.100
WITH THE CAMERA.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.567
ALSO WHILE MANAFORT MAY HAVE

06:57.567 --> 06:58.367
BEEN GONE BEFORE THE ELECTION,

06:58.367 --> 07:00.200
GATES, HIS PARTNER,

07:00.200 --> 07:01.500
WHO PROSECUTORS SAY HAD

07:01.500 --> 07:04.200
55 BANK ACCOUNTS, HELPED RUN

07:04.200 --> 07:05.500
THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE

07:05.500 --> 07:06.266
AND HAS BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR

07:06.266 --> 07:07.767
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.500
SO, AGAIN, THE QUESTION IS:

07:09.500 --> 07:10.633
DID TRUMP KNOW ALL OF THIS

07:10.633 --> 07:12.667
AND NOT CARE?

07:12.667 --> 07:14.300
OR DID HE KNOW NONE OF IT

07:14.300 --> 07:15.600
BECAUSE HE'S INCOMPETENT?

07:15.600 --> 07:16.734
IN OTHER WORDS:

07:16.734 --> 07:17.900
IS TRUMP SMART ENOUGH

07:17.900 --> 07:19.367
TO BE EVIL?

07:19.367 --> 07:21.066
AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT,

07:21.066 --> 07:22.300
CONSIDER THE GENUINELY

07:22.300 --> 07:23.734
SURPRISING NEWS FROM MONDAY,

07:23.734 --> 07:25.133
THE GUILTY PLEA FROM

07:25.133 --> 07:26.900
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, THE FORMER

07:26.900 --> 07:28.967
TRUMP CAMPAIGN STAFFER AND REAL

07:28.967 --> 07:32.266
COOL DUDE, WHO HAS NOW ADMITTED

07:32.266 --> 07:34.900
TO LYING TO THE FBI.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.033
HE COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.433
BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW, NOT ONLY

07:38.433 --> 07:40.166
DID PAPADOPOULOS HAVE CONTACT

07:40.166 --> 07:41.433
WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING

07:41.433 --> 07:42.500
THE CAMPAIGN, WHO APPARENTLY

07:42.500 --> 07:44.800
TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD

07:44.800 --> 07:46.533
"DIRT" ON HILLARY CLINTON,

07:46.533 --> 07:48.867
BUT HE MENTIONED HIS RUSSIAN

07:48.867 --> 07:50.200
CONTACTS TO THE CAMPAIGN,

07:50.200 --> 07:52.700
WHO RESPONDED LIKE THIS.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.333
>> A TRUMP CAMPAIGN SUPERVISOR

07:54.333 --> 07:56.233
TOLD PAPADOPOULOS, "I WOULD

07:56.233 --> 07:58.500
ENCOURAGE YOU TO PURSUE CONTACT

07:58.500 --> 08:00.300
WITH RUSSIANS' AND THAT HE HAD

08:00.300 --> 08:02.867
DONE 'GREAT WORK.'"

08:02.867 --> 08:05.734
>> John: IT SPEAKS TO THE

08:05.734 --> 08:07.800
SHEER STUPIDITY OF THE PEOPLE

08:07.800 --> 08:09.467
INVOLVED THAT THEY SO OFTEN LEFT

08:09.467 --> 08:11.133
WRITTEN RECORDS OF THEIR

08:11.133 --> 08:12.667
POTENTIALLY CRIMINAL ACTIONS.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.767
IT'S LIKE IF DURING WATERGATE,

08:13.767 --> 08:14.867
WE HAD AN E-MAIL CHAIN OF

08:14.867 --> 08:15.834
HOWARD HUNT SAYING

08:15.834 --> 08:19.133
"ABOUT TO BREAK IN!"

08:19.133 --> 08:26.266
AND NIXON REPLYING "NOICE!"

08:26.266 --> 08:27.333
BUT THIS WOULDN'T BE STUPID

08:27.333 --> 08:28.400
WATERGATE WITHOUT SOME TRULY

08:28.400 --> 08:30.600
IDIOTIC DETAILS.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.767
BECAUSE ONE OF PAPADOPOULOS'S

08:31.767 --> 08:32.900
FORMER PROFESSORS DESCRIBED HIM

08:32.900 --> 08:35.533
AS "ZEALOUS AND A BIT SIMPLE,"

08:35.533 --> 08:36.767
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO HOW

08:36.767 --> 08:37.700
YOU WOULD DESCRIBE

08:37.700 --> 08:39.300
A GOLDEN RETRIEVER

08:39.300 --> 08:41.667
IN ISIS, AND SOME OF HIS RUSSIAN

08:41.667 --> 08:42.767
SOURCES TURNED OUT TO BE

08:42.767 --> 08:45.233
PRETTY UNIMPRESSIVE.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.900
>> PAPADOPOULOS WAS IN LONDON,

08:46.900 --> 08:48.333
MEETING WITH HIS RUSSIAN

08:48.333 --> 08:49.934
CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING A WOMAN

08:49.934 --> 08:51.800
HE THOUGHT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN'S

08:51.800 --> 08:55.400
NIECE BUT TURNS OUT WAS NOT.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.734
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.467
WE ARE NOW LIVING IN AN ERA WHEN

08:58.467 --> 08:59.533
THE TOP "NEW YORK TIMES"

08:59.533 --> 09:01.066
HEADLINE COULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE

09:01.066 --> 09:02.467
BEEN: "SHADES McCOOL

09:02.467 --> 09:03.600
GOT CATFISHED BY A FAKE PUTIN

09:03.600 --> 09:05.934
NIECE."

09:05.934 --> 09:07.266
TRUMP IS NOW ALSO DESPERATELY

09:07.266 --> 09:08.000
TRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF

09:08.000 --> 09:09.633
FROM PAPADOPOULOS, CALLING HIM

09:09.633 --> 09:11.033
A LOW-LEVEL VOLUNTEER,

09:11.033 --> 09:13.100
WHICH IS A PRETTY WEAK DEFENSE,

09:13.100 --> 09:14.700
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID TRUMP CALL

09:14.700 --> 09:16.233
HIM AN "EXCELLENT GUY,"

09:16.233 --> 09:17.300
THEY WERE PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER

09:17.300 --> 09:18.767
IN A NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING

09:18.767 --> 09:20.333
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.166
THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS RELEASED

09:22.166 --> 09:23.767
EARLIER THIS WEEK, WHEN THE SEAL

09:23.767 --> 09:26.000
ON GRAND JURY TESTIMONY --

09:26.000 --> 09:27.166
I'M JUST KIDDING.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.300
TRUMP POSTED IT TO HIS INSTAGRAM

09:28.300 --> 09:31.967
LAST MARCH.

09:31.967 --> 09:32.900
OF COURSE HE DID.

09:32.900 --> 09:33.567
AND WHILE THAT PHOTO LOOKS

09:33.567 --> 09:34.200
PRETTY DAMNING, THE WHITE HOUSE

09:34.200 --> 09:34.767
THIS WEEK INSISTED IT

09:34.767 --> 09:36.600
MEANT NOTHING.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.533
>> SARAH, HOW CAN YOU DESCRIBE

09:38.533 --> 09:39.800
MR. PAPADOPOULOS AS HAVING

09:39.800 --> 09:40.867
A LIMITED ROLE WHEN THERE'S

09:40.867 --> 09:43.166
A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR. PAPADOPOULOS

09:43.166 --> 09:44.867
SITTING AT A TABLE WITH

09:44.867 --> 09:46.400
THEN-CANDIDATE TRUMP

09:46.400 --> 09:47.700
AT A NATIONAL SECURITY MEETING?

09:47.700 --> 09:48.400
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS THOUSANDS

09:48.400 --> 09:49.033
OF PHOTOGRAPHS WITH MILLIONS OF

09:49.033 --> 09:50.734
PEOPLE SO...

09:50.734 --> 09:51.967
>> John: NOW, SHE'S NOT WRONG

09:51.967 --> 09:52.633
THERE.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.700
TRUMP HAS TAKEN PHOTOS

09:53.700 --> 09:55.200
WITH MANY, MANY PEOPLE.

09:55.200 --> 09:55.934
HERE'S ONE OF HIM

09:55.934 --> 09:58.133
WITH O.J. SIMPSON.

09:58.133 --> 09:58.834
HERE'S ONE OF TRUMP

09:58.834 --> 10:00.834
AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.700
HERE HE IS WITH GRIMACE.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.266
SO THE PRESIDENT HAS SMILED

10:05.266 --> 10:07.133
FOR PHOTOS WITH MURDERERS,

10:07.133 --> 10:08.300
SEXUAL PREDATORS AND, IN THE

10:08.300 --> 10:11.166
CASE OF GRIMACE, BOTH.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.200
BUT THE POINT IS, NONE OF THEM

10:13.200 --> 10:14.233
GOT TO SIT AT THE TABLE WITH

10:14.233 --> 10:16.066
TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.667
AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED ON FRIDAY

10:17.667 --> 10:19.467
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT

10:19.467 --> 10:21.200
MEETING, THIS WAS HIS RESPONSE.

10:21.200 --> 10:21.867
>> I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT

10:21.867 --> 10:22.934
THAT MEETING.

10:22.934 --> 10:23.867
IT WAS A VERY UNIMPORTANT

10:23.867 --> 10:24.767
MEETING.

10:24.767 --> 10:25.700
TOOK PLACE A LONG TIME --

10:25.700 --> 10:29.000
DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.600
>> John: OH, YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

10:30.600 --> 10:32.000
THAT'S CONVENIENT.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.533
ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT BY

10:33.533 --> 10:36.100
ONE OF TRUMP'S FAVORITE BOASTS.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.600
>> PEOPLE KNOW ME FOR MY MEMORY.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.233
IT'S CALLED, LIKE, UP HERE

10:39.233 --> 10:40.500
AND IT'S CALLED MEMORY

10:40.500 --> 10:41.900
AND IT'S CALLED OTHER THINGS.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.533
I'M FORTUNATE THAT I HAVE

10:42.533 --> 10:43.300
A GOOD MEMORY.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.467
I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY.

10:44.467 --> 10:45.567
I HAVE, LIKE, A GOOD MEMORY.

10:45.567 --> 10:46.300
I HAVE A VERY GOOD MEMORY.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.834
I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY,

10:48.834 --> 10:49.367
LIKE, A GREAT MEMORY.

10:49.367 --> 10:49.934
I HAVE A GREAT MEMORY.

10:49.934 --> 10:50.633
ONE OF THE GREAT MEMORIES

10:50.633 --> 10:52.700
OF ALL TIME.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.367
>> John: YEAH, AND THERE'S

10:55.367 --> 10:56.734
JUST NO WAY TO RECONCILE THOSE

10:56.734 --> 10:58.400
TWO POSITIONS, ALTHOUGH TRUMP

10:58.400 --> 11:00.900
HAS TRIED IN THE PAST.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.066
WHEN HE WAS ASKED DURING

11:02.066 --> 11:03.800
A DEPOSITION IN 2015 ABOUT

11:03.800 --> 11:05.166
CLAIMING HE HAD ONE OF THE

11:05.166 --> 11:06.734
WORLD'S GREAT MEMORIES, HE SAID,

11:06.734 --> 11:08.200
AND I QUOTE:

11:08.200 --> 11:10.400
"I DON'T REMEMBER SAYING THAT.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.000
AS GOOD AS MY MEMORY IS,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.300
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

11:14.300 --> 11:18.900
BUT I HAVE A GOOD MEMORY."

11:18.900 --> 11:20.867
SO, RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE THREE

11:20.867 --> 11:22.800
PEOPLE FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,

11:22.800 --> 11:24.066
FACING SERIOUS CHARGES ABOUT

11:24.066 --> 11:25.467
THEIR ENTANGLEMENTS OVERSEAS.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.800
AND IN ALL THREE CASES, TRUMP'S

11:26.800 --> 11:28.533
PUSHBACK HAS BASICALLY BEEN,

11:28.533 --> 11:30.367
"I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

11:30.367 --> 11:31.734
PEOPLE I SHOULD'VE KNOWN THOSE

11:31.734 --> 11:33.834
THINGS ABOUT."

11:33.834 --> 11:35.233
IT'S HIS SIGNATURE MOVE.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.467
HE'S PLAYING THE TRUMP CARD.

11:37.467 --> 11:38.467
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS,

11:38.467 --> 11:39.400
HE'S USING HIS OWN INCOMPETENCE

11:39.400 --> 11:41.233
AS A DEFENSE.

11:41.233 --> 11:42.200
IT'S THE SAME WAY YOU MIGHT

11:42.200 --> 11:44.133
EXCUSE THE BEHAVIOR OF A DOG

11:44.133 --> 11:45.567
OR A SMALL CHILD.

11:45.567 --> 11:46.633
IF YOU FOUND YOUR DOG

11:46.633 --> 11:49.433
PISSING ON A RUG, AND THEN

11:49.433 --> 11:51.633
YOUR CHILD URINATING ON THE DOG,

11:51.633 --> 11:53.767
YOU'D THINK, "YES, I'M ANNOYED,

11:53.767 --> 11:54.400
BUT THEY'RE IDIOTS WHO DON'T

11:54.400 --> 11:55.834
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING, SO THEY

11:55.834 --> 11:57.667
GET TO WALK AWAY FROM THIS ONE."

11:57.667 --> 12:03.533
THAT IS THE TRUMP CARD.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.900
AND THE WORRYING THING HERE IS,

12:05.900 --> 12:08.700
IT MAY WORK FOR TRUMP.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.834
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT WHAT

12:09.834 --> 12:10.500
THE COUNTERARGUMENT WOULD BE.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.166
"THIS IS A METICULOUS MAN WHO

12:11.166 --> 12:12.200
MADE STRATEGIC DECISIONS,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.600
FULLY AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES

12:13.600 --> 12:15.700
OF HIS ACTIONS."

12:15.700 --> 12:17.500
THAT'S A TOUGH CASE TO MAKE.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.633
BUT WE CAN'T ACCEPT THE TRUMP

12:18.633 --> 12:20.867
CARD AS HIS DEFENSE.

12:20.867 --> 12:23.133
BECAUSE IF WE DO, THINK ABOUT

12:23.133 --> 12:26.633
WHAT WE ACTUALLY BE SAYING.

12:26.633 --> 12:27.934
"LOOK, THIS GUY'S TOO DUMB

12:27.934 --> 12:30.233
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S

12:30.233 --> 12:31.333
DOING, SO I GUESS WE HAVE

12:31.333 --> 12:32.667
NO CHOICE BUT TO LET HIM

12:32.667 --> 12:38.266
KEEP BEING PRESIDENT."

12:38.266 --> 12:39.200
PLEASE LET'S NOT DO THAT.

12:39.200 --> 12:49.266
AND NOW THIS.

12:49.266 --> 12:55.033
>> HALLOWEEN HAS COME TO CHANNE.

12:55.033 --> 13:00.333
>> WE ARE THE MINIONS.

13:00.333 --> 13:05.834
>> MISSION FROM GOD.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.433
>> MARIO.

13:08.433 --> 13:11.400
>> [LAUGHS]

13:11.400 --> 13:11.967
>> NICE.

13:11.967 --> 13:15.166
>> THIS IS KATE, ONE OF OUR

13:15.166 --> 13:17.200
INTERNS.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.066
>> I'VE GOT TO WATCH MY

13:20.066 --> 13:21.667
CORNSTALKS.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.033
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

13:24.033 --> 13:27.066
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO PUT --

13:27.066 --> 13:28.367
>> TWO SECONDS.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.600
>> REALLY FAST?

13:30.600 --> 13:33.600
>> WE CAN'T HAVE YOU READING THE

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
NEWS IN A COSTUME.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.600
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.600
>> DEVELOPMENTS MA

13:39.600 --> 13:40.266
HOUSTON COUNTY TRUCK BOMBING

13:40.266 --> 13:42.734
CASE COMING UP.

13:42.734 --> 13:43.567
>> John: MOVING ON.

13:43.567 --> 13:44.200
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

13:44.200 --> 13:45.467
JOBS, LITERALLY THE ONLY REASON

13:45.467 --> 13:47.467
ANYONE GETS UP BEFORE 11:00 A.M.

13:47.467 --> 13:48.734
POLITICIANS CARE ABOUT JOBS MORE

13:48.734 --> 13:50.100
THAN ANYTHING ELSE, AS YOU CAN

13:50.100 --> 13:51.200
TELL FROM HOW OFTEN THEY

13:51.200 --> 13:54.333
MENTION THEM.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.200
>> THESE ARE THE THINGS I HAVE

13:55.200 --> 13:56.033
FOCUSED ON: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.600
>> JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.967
>> JOBS, JOBS, AND JOBS.

13:58.967 --> 13:59.667
PERIOD.

13:59.667 --> 14:04.333
>> JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.033
>> IT'S ABOUT JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,

14:07.033 --> 14:08.567
GOOD PAYING JOBS.

14:08.567 --> 14:09.700
>> IT'S ABOUT JOBS.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.467
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS, AND MORE JOBS,

14:11.467 --> 14:13.066
AMERICAN JOBS.

14:13.066 --> 14:14.066
>> John: POLITICIANS SEEM

14:14.066 --> 14:14.700
TO THINK THAT JOBS ARE LIKE

14:14.700 --> 14:19.800
"BEETLEJUICE."

14:19.800 --> 14:21.166
IF YOU JUST SAY THE WORD

14:21.166 --> 14:22.266
A MAGIC NUMBER OF TIMES,

14:22.266 --> 14:23.233
EVENTUALLY, THEY'LL JUST POP UP

14:23.233 --> 14:24.100
OUT OF NOWHERE.

14:24.100 --> 14:24.633
MORE SPECIFICALLY TONIGHT,

14:24.633 --> 14:25.533
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF

14:25.533 --> 14:26.033
THE WAYS POLITICIANS TRY

14:26.033 --> 14:26.667
TO CREATE JOBS:

14:26.667 --> 14:28.700
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES.

14:28.700 --> 14:29.834
AND I KNOW THAT DOESN'T

14:29.834 --> 14:30.533
SOUND INTERESTING --

14:30.533 --> 14:31.667
WAIT!

14:31.667 --> 14:32.967
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

14:32.967 --> 14:33.600
YOU'RE PUTTING ME

14:33.600 --> 14:35.300
PICTURE-IN-PICTURE?

14:35.300 --> 14:37.600
IS THAT "ENTOURAGE: THE MOVIE"?

14:37.600 --> 14:37.800
FINE!

14:37.800 --> 14:38.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:38.367 --> 14:39.800
SWITCH OVER THE AUDIO.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.867
LISTEN TO THE FIRST LINE.

14:40.867 --> 14:43.400
YOU'LL BE BACK.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.633
>> I MAY HAVE TO JERK IT

14:44.633 --> 14:46.633
BEFORE WE EVEN GET THERE.

14:46.633 --> 14:51.567
>> John: OH!

14:51.567 --> 14:52.567
HOW ABOUT THAT?

14:52.567 --> 14:53.266
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A SHOW ABOUT

14:53.266 --> 14:53.834
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T

14:53.834 --> 14:54.367
SEEM LIKE THE WORST THING

14:54.367 --> 14:56.133
YOU COULD BE WATCHING, DOES IT?

14:56.133 --> 15:02.867
SO, AS I WAS SAYING,

15:02.867 --> 15:03.567
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVES

15:03.567 --> 15:04.233
ARE ESSENTIALLY WHEN STATE AND

15:04.233 --> 15:05.834
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFFER PERKS TO

15:05.834 --> 15:07.066
COMPANIES TO ENTICE THEM TO

15:07.066 --> 15:09.867
BUILD OR EXPAND IN THEIR AREA.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.033
HERE IN NEW YORK,

15:11.033 --> 15:11.900
THERE'S A PROGRAM CALLED

15:11.900 --> 15:12.767
"START-UP NEW YORK" WHICH

15:12.767 --> 15:14.266
LAUNCHED WITH SOME PRETTY

15:14.266 --> 15:16.467
ASTOUNDING TAX BREAKS.

15:16.467 --> 15:17.400
>> STARTUP NEW YORK CREATES

15:17.400 --> 15:18.367
ZERO TAX ZONES

15:18.367 --> 15:19.433
FOR NEW BUSINESSES

15:19.433 --> 15:20.767
FOR TEN YEARS,

15:20.767 --> 15:22.233
ZERO PROPERTY TAX,

15:22.233 --> 15:23.767
ZERO CORPORATE TAX,

15:23.767 --> 15:25.600
ZERO BUSINESS TAX,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.867
AND ZERO INCOME TAX.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.133
>> John: WOW.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.600
ZERO PROPERTY, CORPORATE,

15:30.600 --> 15:35.033
BUSINESS AND INCOME TAX.

15:35.033 --> 15:35.967
I BELIEVE THAT SOUND YOU

15:35.967 --> 15:37.000
JUST HEARD WAS DONALD TRUMP

15:37.000 --> 15:39.033
GETTING AN ERECTION.

15:39.033 --> 15:40.300
WAIT FOR IT.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.900
WAIT FOR IT.

15:41.900 --> 15:47.533
AND IT'S GONE AGAIN.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.967
SEE YOU NEXT YEAR, LITTLE BUDDY.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.100
LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST NEW YORK.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.000
ALL 50 STATES OFFER SOME KIND OF

15:52.000 --> 15:53.400
INCENTIVES, LIKE TAX BREAKS,

15:53.400 --> 15:54.500
TO ATTRACT COMPANIES.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.867
AND THE ARGUMENT IS, THEY

15:55.867 --> 15:57.533
ATTRACT EMPLOYERS, WHICH ATTRACT

15:57.533 --> 15:59.433
JOBS, WHICH LEAD TO SPENDING,

15:59.433 --> 16:00.433
WHICH CREATES MORE JOBS,

16:00.433 --> 16:02.033
AND SO ON AND SO ON.

16:02.033 --> 16:03.600
AND MANY PLACES HAVE BOUGHT INTO

16:03.600 --> 16:05.000
THIS HARD, TRYING TO OUTBID

16:05.000 --> 16:07.200
ONE ANOTHER FOR BUSINESSES.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
INDIANA EVEN ONCE TOOK OUT

16:08.200 --> 16:10.233
ATTACK ADS ON OTHER STATES,

16:10.233 --> 16:12.500
LIKE THIS BILLBOARD, WHICH READ:

16:12.500 --> 16:14.633
"ILLINOYED BY HIGHER TAXES?

16:14.633 --> 16:15.533
COME TO INDIANA, A STATE

16:15.533 --> 16:16.934
THAT WORKS."

16:16.934 --> 16:19.033
AND THAT'S PRETTY AGGRESSIVE,

16:19.033 --> 16:20.166
THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH TAMER

16:20.166 --> 16:21.433
THAN THEIR ORIGINAL BILLBOARD,

16:21.433 --> 16:23.166
"JUST ARKAN-SAW YOUR TAX BILL?

16:23.166 --> 16:24.066
IDA-HOPE YOU LIKE

16:24.066 --> 16:25.300
OUR TAX BREAKS.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.633
BECAUSE IF YOU COLORA-DON'T,

16:26.633 --> 16:27.433
WE'LL CONNECTI-CUT

16:27.433 --> 16:30.367
YOUR FUCKING BALLS OFF."

16:30.367 --> 16:32.500
AND IF A COMPANY'S BIG ENOUGH,

16:32.500 --> 16:33.133
IT CAN EVEN START A BIDDING WAR

16:33.133 --> 16:34.567
ITSELF.

16:34.567 --> 16:35.433
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

16:35.433 --> 16:36.834
WITH AMAZON.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.767
THEY'RE PLANNING TO BUILD

16:37.767 --> 16:39.266
A SECOND HEADQUARTERS SOMEWHERE

16:39.266 --> 16:41.800
IN NORTH AMERICA, AND THEY'RE

16:41.800 --> 16:44.000
MAKING GOVERNMENTS BID FOR THEM.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
THEY EVEN RELEASED EIGHT PAGES

16:45.000 --> 16:46.333
OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANDIDATES,

16:46.333 --> 16:47.233
TELLING THEM

16:47.233 --> 16:49.233
"TO THINK BIG AND BE CREATIVE,"

16:49.233 --> 16:51.367
WHICH LED MANY CITIES TO DO

16:51.367 --> 16:53.066
STUPID SHIT LIKE THIS.

16:53.066 --> 16:54.767
>> OVERNIGHT, THE BIG APPLE

16:54.767 --> 16:56.133
LOOKING MORE LIKE AN ORANGE.

16:56.133 --> 16:56.834
NEW YORK CITY MAYOR

16:56.834 --> 16:58.000
BILL de BLASIO LIGHTING UP THE

16:58.000 --> 17:00.433
CITY IN "AMAZON ORANGE."

17:00.433 --> 17:01.867
>> THE CITY OF BIRMINGHAM IS

17:01.867 --> 17:04.400
USING GIANT AMAZON BOXES TO TRY

17:04.400 --> 17:06.367
TO GET AMAZON'S ATTENTION.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.667
>> STONECREST, GEORGIA, OFFERING

17:07.667 --> 17:09.000
TO CREATE A NEW TOWN OF AMAZON,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.834
GEORGIA.

17:11.834 --> 17:14.100
>> John: THEY WOULD CREATE A NEW

17:14.100 --> 17:16.166
TOWN AND NAME IT AMAZON.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.600
TO COMPETE, I'M SURPRISED THAT

17:17.600 --> 17:19.000
OMAHA, NEBRASKA, DIDN'T OFFER

17:19.000 --> 17:20.934
TO LET JEFF BEZOS KILL ANY THREE

17:20.934 --> 17:22.834
PEOPLE HE LIKES, BECAUSE

17:22.834 --> 17:24.266
YOU KNOW HE WOULD.

17:24.266 --> 17:25.100
LOOK AT HIM.

17:25.100 --> 17:29.100
HE WANTS IT SO BAD.

17:29.100 --> 17:34.500
IT'S THE ONLY THING

17:34.500 --> 17:35.900
HE CAN'T HAVE AND HE WANTS IT.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.367
AND NUMEROUS MAYORS MADE DIRECT

17:37.367 --> 17:37.967
APPEALS TO AMAZON, WITH VIDEOS

17:37.967 --> 17:38.567
ENDING IN VERSIONS OF THE SAME

17:38.567 --> 17:38.900
BAD JOKE.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.100
>> HEY, ALEXA, WHERE SHOULD

17:40.100 --> 17:40.867
AMAZON LOCATE HQ2?

17:40.867 --> 17:41.900
>> HMM.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.734
IN FRISCO, TEXAS.

17:43.734 --> 17:45.767
>> ALEXA, WHERE IS THE MOST

17:45.767 --> 17:47.467
INTERESTING COMPANY IN THE WORLD

17:47.467 --> 17:49.166
GONNA LOCATE?

17:49.166 --> 17:51.367
>> OBVIOUSLY, WASHINGTON DC.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.900
>> SO ALEXA, WHERE IS THE BEST

17:52.900 --> 17:54.900
PLACE FOR AMAZON TO LOCATE

17:54.900 --> 17:56.834
ITS SECOND WORLD HEADQUARTERS?

17:56.834 --> 17:58.433
>> DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.767
>> I TOLD YOU SO.

18:00.767 --> 18:01.900
>> John: MY ONE AND ONLY WORRY

18:01.900 --> 18:02.667
WITH ALL OF THOSE ADS,

18:02.667 --> 18:05.900
AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY,

18:05.900 --> 18:08.367
ARE THEY ALMOST TOO HILARIOUS?

18:08.367 --> 18:09.433
BUT THOSE STUNTS ARE JUST

18:09.433 --> 18:10.667
WINDOW DRESSING.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.600
WHAT AMAZON CARES MORE ABOUT,

18:13.600 --> 18:15.266
AS THEY MENTIONED IN THEIR

18:15.266 --> 18:17.033
INSTRUCTIONS 21 SEPARATE TIMES,

18:17.033 --> 18:18.600
ARE TAX INCENTIVES.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.467
AND WHILE FEW PLACES ARE

18:19.467 --> 18:21.033
REVEALING WHAT THEY OFFERED,

18:21.033 --> 18:22.300
WE DO KNOW THAT NEW JERSEY

18:22.300 --> 18:24.633
REPORTEDLY OFFERED $7 BILLION

18:24.633 --> 18:26.033
IN TAX BREAKS,

18:26.033 --> 18:28.000
WHICH IS AN INSANE AMOUNT THAT

18:28.000 --> 18:29.800
OTHER PLACES MAY HAVE TO COMPETE

18:29.800 --> 18:30.633
WITH.

18:30.633 --> 18:32.367
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.033
THAT COULD BE BILLIONS OF TAX

18:34.033 --> 18:36.467
DOLLARS THAT DON'T GO TO ROADS

18:36.467 --> 18:38.400
OR SCHOOLS OR HOSPITALS.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.100
AND AMAZON ALREADY HAS MORE

18:40.100 --> 18:40.934
MONEY THAN IT KNOWS

18:40.934 --> 18:42.400
WHAT TO DO WITH.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.433
HOW ELSE CAN YOU EXPLAIN

18:43.433 --> 18:45.467
THE EXISTENCE OF "GOLIATH,"

18:45.467 --> 18:46.633
A SHOW THAT --

18:46.633 --> 18:48.100
AND THIS IS TRUE --

18:48.100 --> 18:57.266
LITERALLY NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN.

18:57.266 --> 19:01.100
NOBODY, NO HUMAN, NO ANIMAL.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.934
NOBODY, NO ONE.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.834
DOES IT EXIST?

19:05.834 --> 19:07.100
AND THAT'S THE THING.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.133
WE GIVE COMPANIES A LOT OF MONEY

19:08.133 --> 19:09.233
THROUGH THESE INCENTIVES.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.700
BY ONE ESTIMATE, IN 2015,

19:11.700 --> 19:12.500
THEY COST STATE AND LOCAL

19:12.500 --> 19:15.433
GOVERNMENTS $45 BILLION.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.300
AND THAT MONEY CAN GO TO SOME

19:16.300 --> 19:17.533
QUESTIONABLE PROJECTS.

19:17.533 --> 19:18.266
FOR INSTANCE, A FEW YEARS AGO,

19:18.266 --> 19:19.500
KENTUCKY TOOK A BIG SWING

19:19.500 --> 19:21.900
ON THIS.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.033
>> A FULL SIZED REPLICA OF

19:23.033 --> 19:27.533
NOAH'S ARK IS DRAWING THOUSANDS

19:27.533 --> 19:28.900
OF VISITORS TO WILLIAMSTOWN,

19:28.900 --> 19:29.300
KENTUCKY.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.367
>> THIS IS THE ARK ENCOUNTER,

19:30.367 --> 19:31.667
A CHAPTER FROM GENESIS TOLD

19:31.667 --> 19:35.433
ON A $100 MILLION BUDGET.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.567
FOUR FLOORS OF NOAH, HIS FAMILY,

19:37.567 --> 19:39.133
AND BEASTS, GREAT AND SMALL.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.100
>> THE PROJECT RECEIVED

19:41.100 --> 19:42.233
$18 MILLION IN KENTUCKY

19:42.233 --> 19:44.266
TAX INCENTIVES.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.800
>> John: $18 MILLION

19:45.800 --> 19:47.233
OF TAX BREAKS!

19:47.233 --> 19:48.834
FOR A GIGANTIC ARK MUSEUM!

19:48.834 --> 19:49.767
AND I'M NOT SAYING

19:49.767 --> 19:53.633
THAT'S AN INHERENTLY BAD IDEA.

19:53.633 --> 19:54.667
I DO KIND OF WANT TO SEE IT,

19:54.667 --> 19:55.600
ESPECIALLY AS ITS WEBSITE

19:55.600 --> 19:57.000
GENUINELY HAS A SECTION DEVOTED

19:57.000 --> 19:58.633
TO THE QUESTION "WHAT ABOUT ALL

19:58.633 --> 20:01.166
THE MANURE?"

20:01.166 --> 20:02.867
THE ANSWER, APPARENTLY,

20:02.867 --> 20:07.367
IS "SLATTED FLOORS

20:07.367 --> 20:08.166
ON MULTIPLE-LEVEL CAGES."

20:08.166 --> 20:09.100
WHICH IS NOT A GOOD ANSWER,

20:09.100 --> 20:10.133
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE

20:10.133 --> 20:11.166
THE ANIMAL ON THE LOWEST LEVEL

20:11.166 --> 20:12.767
OF THAT SHIP.

20:12.767 --> 20:13.734
AND WHILE THE ARK CLEARLY

20:13.734 --> 20:15.467
CREATED SOME JOBS, THERE WERE

20:15.467 --> 20:18.400
SOME CAVEATS TO THOSE POSITIONS.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.400
>> CRITICS COMPLAIN OF

20:19.400 --> 20:21.367
DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING.

20:21.367 --> 20:22.700
ONLY CHRISTIANS.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.200
NO GAYS OR LESBIANS,

20:24.200 --> 20:25.667
AND SINGLE PEOPLE HAVE TO SIGN

20:25.667 --> 20:28.133
A CHASTITY PLEDGE.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.400
>> John: OH, COME ON.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.900
ASIDE FROM THE HOMOPHOBIA,

20:31.900 --> 20:34.066
CHASTITY IS A PRETTY WEIRD RULE

20:34.066 --> 20:35.633
TO PUT IN PLACE FOR THE MUSEUM

20:35.633 --> 20:37.600
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH A GIGANTIC

20:37.600 --> 20:40.033
REPLICA OF A FLOATING FUCK-ZOO.

20:40.033 --> 20:40.867
THEY WEREN'T BROUGHT IN TWO

20:40.867 --> 20:42.600
BY TWO SO EVERYONE WOULD HAVE

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
A SWIM BUDDY.

20:44.600 --> 20:51.233
THEY WERE ON THAT BOAT TO FUCK.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.367
TO FUCK.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.467
BUT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TAKING

20:54.467 --> 20:56.200
A GAMBLE ON A GIGANTIC ARK

20:56.200 --> 20:57.133
WAS THAT IT WOULD BE A BOON

20:57.133 --> 20:58.967
TO THE WHOLE AREA.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.533
AND TO HEAR AT LEAST ONE LOCAL

21:00.533 --> 21:01.867
OFFICIAL TELL IT, THE ECONOMIC

21:01.867 --> 21:03.800
IMPACT HAS BEEN UNDERWHELMING.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.467
>> THE ARK'S SUCCESS HAS NOT

21:05.467 --> 21:06.767
HAD THE RIPPLE EFFECT

21:06.767 --> 21:08.000
MANY HOPED IT WOULD.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.934
>> DOWNTOWN WILLIAMSTOWN, WHICH

21:08.934 --> 21:10.233
WAS EXPECTING INCREASED CAR AND

21:10.233 --> 21:12.767
FOOT TRAFFIC HAS ALMOST AS MANY

21:12.767 --> 21:14.300
EMPTY STOREFRONTS AS OCCUPIED

21:14.300 --> 21:16.400
STOREFRONTS.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.166
>> WHAT'S IT MEANT FOR DOWNTOWN

21:17.166 --> 21:18.166
WILLIAMSTOWN?

21:18.166 --> 21:19.800
>> NOTHING.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.467
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND NEGATIVE

21:21.467 --> 21:23.100
IN THIS INTERVIEW,

21:23.100 --> 21:25.066
BUT THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

21:25.066 --> 21:25.767
>> John: YEAH, THAT KIND OF

21:25.767 --> 21:26.700
MAKES SENSE.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.633
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE SPENT THREE

21:27.633 --> 21:28.500
HOURS WALKING AROUND

21:28.500 --> 21:29.667
A WOODEN BOAT WITH SEXUALLY

21:29.667 --> 21:33.500
FRUSTRATED TOUR GUIDES,

21:33.500 --> 21:34.367
AND HAUNTED BY THE MENTAL IMAGE

21:34.367 --> 21:35.100
OF A MISERABLE ZEBRA

21:35.100 --> 21:36.367
NECK-DEEP IN SHIT BECAUSE

21:36.367 --> 21:37.633
APPARENTLY DECKS WERE ASSIGNED

21:37.633 --> 21:40.734
ALPHABETICALLY, YOU'RE PROBABLY

21:40.734 --> 21:43.633
GONNA SKIP LUNCH IN TOWN.

21:43.633 --> 21:49.500
AND LOOK, A WELL-DESIGNED,

21:49.500 --> 21:50.300
MONITORED PROGRAM WITH

21:50.300 --> 21:50.867
CLEAR GOALS MIGHT MAKE SENSE

21:50.867 --> 21:51.533
TO AN AREA.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.033
BUT TOO OFTEN, THE TERMS

21:52.033 --> 21:53.266
ARE EXTREMELY LAX.

21:53.266 --> 21:53.967
SOME DON'T REQUIRE THAT JOBS

21:53.967 --> 21:55.433
BE CREATED AT ALL.

21:55.433 --> 21:56.533
AND SOME REQUIRE ALMOST

21:56.533 --> 21:58.500
LAUGHABLY FEW.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.333
REMEMBER "STARTUP NEW YORK"?

22:00.333 --> 22:06.834
ZERO TAXES FOR A DECADE?

22:06.834 --> 22:10.400
[WHISTLE]

22:10.400 --> 22:11.333
I'M SORRY.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.100
IT'LL PASS.

22:13.100 --> 22:16.967
THAT PROGRAM ONLY REQUIRED

22:16.967 --> 22:18.300
TO CREATE ONE NEW JOB A YEAR,

22:18.300 --> 22:19.100
AND THE STATE RECENTLY

22:19.100 --> 22:20.533
CONSIDERED SCALING THAT BACK TO

22:20.533 --> 22:21.033
ONE NEW JOB IN THE FIRST

22:21.033 --> 22:21.934
FIVE YEARS.

22:21.934 --> 22:23.500
AND SOMETIMES, THESE INCENTIVES

22:23.500 --> 22:24.400
ARE GIVEN OUT EVEN WHEN THEY MAY

22:24.400 --> 22:25.567
NOT BE NECESSARY.

22:25.567 --> 22:26.367
TAKE A LOOK AT

22:26.367 --> 22:30.500
FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.

22:30.500 --> 22:35.266
YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.600
FARGO GAVE A TAX BREAK

22:36.600 --> 22:37.133
TO FEDEX WHEN THEY MOVED

22:37.133 --> 22:43.533
A FACILITY TO THEIR CITY.

22:43.533 --> 22:45.066
WHY DID THEY NEED TO?

22:45.066 --> 22:45.800
JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENED

22:45.800 --> 22:46.367
WHEN ONE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER

22:46.367 --> 22:46.767
QUESTIONED A FEDEX

22:46.767 --> 22:47.367
REPRESENTATIVE.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.166
>> MR. WILSON, IF YOU DON'T GET

22:48.166 --> 22:48.767
THIS EXEMPTION, WILL YOU STILL

22:48.767 --> 22:49.133
MOVE TO FARGO?

22:49.133 --> 22:49.900
>> YES, SIR, WE WILL.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.967
>> OKAY.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.433
>> John: YET TEN MINUTES LATER,

22:54.433 --> 22:57.333
THE COUNCIL VOTED TO GIVE FEDEX

22:57.333 --> 22:58.367
THAT EXEMPTION.

22:58.367 --> 22:59.567
ALSO IF SOMEONE WANTS

22:59.567 --> 23:00.367
TO WILLINGLY MOVE TO FARGO, YOU

23:00.367 --> 23:01.834
DON'T OFFER THEM TAX INCENTIVES.

23:01.834 --> 23:03.333
YOU SIMPLY OFFER THEM A FULL

23:03.333 --> 23:04.700
PSYCHOLOGICAL WORKUP THAT STARTS

23:04.700 --> 23:06.066
WITH THE QUESTION,

23:06.066 --> 23:08.367
"WHO DID YOU MURDER?

23:08.367 --> 23:11.633
WE'LL STILL LET YOU LIVE HERE,

23:11.633 --> 23:13.400
BUT WE DO NEED TO KNOW."

23:13.400 --> 23:14.333
AND THEN THERE ARE PROGRAMS

23:14.333 --> 23:16.100
NARROWLY SET UP TO ENCOURAGE

23:16.100 --> 23:18.133
A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY TO GROW.

23:18.133 --> 23:19.800
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT, BUT MAY NOT

23:19.800 --> 23:21.867
LEAD TO GOOD, PERMANENT JOBS.

23:21.867 --> 23:24.000
TAKE FILM AND TV INCENTIVES.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.533
AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST COUPLE

23:25.533 --> 23:27.200
OF DECADES, NEARLY EVERY STATE

23:27.200 --> 23:28.000
DECIDED THEY WANTED TO BE

23:28.000 --> 23:29.533
THE NEXT HOLLYWOOD.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.266
AND NOW, 31 STATES HAVE

23:31.266 --> 23:32.934
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR FILM

23:32.934 --> 23:34.133
OR TV.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.367
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS,

23:35.367 --> 23:36.667
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THEM, YOU HAVE

23:36.667 --> 23:40.166
30 STATES COMPETING WITH YOU.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.667
AND BECAUSE FILM PRODUCTIONS ARE

23:41.667 --> 23:42.633
PORTABLE, IF YOU TRY AND SCALE

23:42.633 --> 23:44.400
BACK YOUR INCENTIVES, THEY'LL

23:44.400 --> 23:46.033
JUST GO WHEREVER A BETTER DEAL

23:46.033 --> 23:46.500
IS.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.967
JUST LISTEN TO THIS MOVIE

23:47.967 --> 23:48.934
PRODUCER, WHO'S TAKEN ADVANTAGE

23:48.934 --> 23:51.333
OF MULTIPLE STATES' INCENTIVES.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.800
>> I WOULD NEVER MAKE A MOVIE

23:52.800 --> 23:53.934
WHERE I DIDN'T GET AN INCENTIVE

23:53.934 --> 23:56.934
AND I DON'T EVER INTEND TO.

23:56.934 --> 23:57.800
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

23:57.800 --> 23:59.367
IF THERE'S AN INCENTIVE,

23:59.367 --> 24:01.100
IT'S GOOD FOR ME.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.934
>> John: AND LOOK,

24:02.934 --> 24:05.266
HE'S NOT WRONG.

24:05.266 --> 24:06.200
HE LOOKS LIKE EVERY WOMAN'S

24:06.200 --> 24:07.900
WORST EX-BOYFRIEND,

24:07.900 --> 24:09.934
BUT HE IS NOT WRONG.

24:09.934 --> 24:10.867
IT'S NOT HIS JOB TO WORRY ABOUT

24:10.867 --> 24:12.367
WHETHER HIS INCENTIVES

24:12.367 --> 24:14.100
ARE GOOD FOR STATES.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.967
IT'S HIS JOB TO, I'M ASSUMING,

24:15.967 --> 24:20.934
REFER TO SUSHI AS "SUSH."

24:20.934 --> 24:21.967
HE DEFINITELY DOES THAT.

24:21.967 --> 24:23.633
BUT IT SHOULD BE SOMEONE'S JOB

24:23.633 --> 24:24.633
TO WORRY ABOUT THE EFFECTS

24:24.633 --> 24:32.333
OF THESE PROGRAMS.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.166
LOUISIANA FOUND THAT, FOR EVERY

24:33.166 --> 24:33.867
DOLLAR IT SPENT ON ITS FILM

24:33.867 --> 24:34.967
PROGRAM, IT GENERATED JUST

24:34.967 --> 24:36.967
22 CENTS OF TAX REVENUE,

24:36.967 --> 24:38.867
WHICH SOUNDS BAD, BUT IS STILL

24:38.867 --> 24:40.266
BETTER THAN MARYLAND, WHICH MADE

24:40.266 --> 24:41.533
JUST 10 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR

24:41.533 --> 24:45.867
SPENT.

24:45.867 --> 24:46.667
WHICH IS STILL BETTER

24:46.667 --> 24:47.233
THAN CONNECTICUT'S PROGRAM,

24:47.233 --> 24:47.834
WHICH RETURNED ONLY 7 CENTS

24:47.834 --> 24:52.667
ON THE DOLLAR.

24:52.667 --> 24:53.400
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A DOLLAR

24:53.400 --> 24:56.834
INTO A VENDING MACHINE AND

24:56.834 --> 24:58.567
GETTING A SINGLE YELLOW

24:58.567 --> 24:59.633
STARBURST.

24:59.633 --> 25:00.667
AT SOME POINT WHAT YOU'RE

25:00.667 --> 25:01.600
GETTING OUT IS NOT WORTH WHAT

25:01.600 --> 25:04.300
YOU'RE PUTTING IN.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.100
AND DEFENDERS OF ECONOMIC

25:05.100 --> 25:05.734
INCENTIVES WILL SAY THAT'S JUST

25:05.734 --> 25:06.266
A FRACTION OF THE BROADER

25:06.266 --> 25:06.867
ECONOMIC BENEFIT THEY BRING.

25:06.867 --> 25:07.533
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S NOT MUCH

25:07.533 --> 25:07.934
EVIDENCE FOR THAT.

25:07.934 --> 25:09.100
AND I KNOW ACCOUNTING FOR

25:09.100 --> 25:09.633
THE TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT

25:09.633 --> 25:11.500
OF ANYTHING IS TRICKY.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.567
BUT WE'RE GAMBLING BILLIONS

25:12.567 --> 25:14.300
OF DOLLARS ON LITTLE MORE THAN

25:14.300 --> 25:15.333
FAITH, AND EVEN BASIC

25:15.333 --> 25:17.033
INFORMATION CAN BE HARD

25:17.033 --> 25:18.333
TO COME BY.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.100
ONE STUDY FOUND THAT

25:19.100 --> 25:20.500
THREE-QUARTERS OF MAJOR STATE

25:20.500 --> 25:21.867
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS DON'T EVEN

25:21.867 --> 25:24.333
DISCLOSE ACTUAL JOBS CREATED

25:24.333 --> 25:26.066
OR WORKERS TRAINED.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.333
SO WE'RE BASICALLY THROWING

25:27.333 --> 25:29.033
MONEY DOWN A HOLE AND HOPING IT

25:29.033 --> 25:30.467
BRINGS US PROSPERITY, WHICH IS

25:30.467 --> 25:31.900
THE EXACT BUSINESS MODEL OF

25:31.900 --> 25:36.066
A WISHING WELL.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.834
AND TO SEE THIS AT PERHAPS

25:37.834 --> 25:38.567
ITS MOST POINTLESS, JUST LOOK AT

25:38.567 --> 25:40.367
KANSAS AND MISSOURI.

25:40.367 --> 25:41.467
THEY'VE OFFERED COMPETING TAX

25:41.467 --> 25:43.033
BREAKS TO BUSINESSES FOR YEARS,

25:43.033 --> 25:44.133
WHICH HAS MADE THINGS

25:44.133 --> 25:45.000
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

25:45.000 --> 25:46.900
IN ONE METRO AREA.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.867
>> SO, I'M IN KANSAS CITY,

25:47.867 --> 25:48.934
MISSOURI.

25:48.934 --> 25:50.600
THAT'S IT BEHIND ME.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.467
THERE IS KANSAS CITY, KANSAS.

25:52.467 --> 25:54.166
TWO STATES, ONE METRO AREA,

25:54.166 --> 25:55.467
BUT BOTH STATES OFFER SUBSIDIES

25:55.467 --> 25:56.633
FOR JOB CREATION.

25:56.633 --> 25:57.533
CREATE A JOB,

25:57.533 --> 25:58.734
YOU GET A TAX BREAK.

25:58.734 --> 26:00.433
SO WHAT DO BUSINESSES DO?

26:00.433 --> 26:01.767
OUR MISSOURI BUSINESS WILL MOVE

26:01.767 --> 26:02.433
SOME EMPLOYEES OVER TO

26:02.433 --> 26:04.734
KANSAS CITY, KANSAS,

26:04.734 --> 26:05.767
AND CLAIM A TAX BREAK.

26:05.767 --> 26:06.266
MOVE 'EM BACK,

26:06.266 --> 26:07.967
CLAIM ANOTHER TAX BREAK.

26:07.967 --> 26:08.667
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

26:08.667 --> 26:09.533
FOR INSTANCE, KANSAS CITY,

26:09.533 --> 26:11.033
MISSOURI, LOST CORPORATE OFFICES

26:11.033 --> 26:12.734
FOR ALL THESE COMPANIES

26:12.734 --> 26:14.066
TO KANSAS CITY, KANSAS, WHICH,

26:14.066 --> 26:15.567
IN TURN, LOST OFFICES FOR

26:15.567 --> 26:17.266
ALL THESE COMPANIES TO

26:17.266 --> 26:18.767
KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI.

26:18.767 --> 26:21.333
AND THAT ISN'T CREATING JOBS ANY

26:21.333 --> 26:22.600
MORE THAN MOVING YOUR COUCH FROM

26:22.600 --> 26:24.000
THE BEDROOM TO THE LIVING ROOM

26:24.000 --> 26:27.433
IS CREATING FURNITURE.

26:27.433 --> 26:28.433
AND THIS WAR HAS COME

26:28.433 --> 26:29.767
AT A REAL COST.

26:29.767 --> 26:31.200
A LOCAL FOUNDATION STUDIED TWO

26:31.200 --> 26:34.100
STATE-LEVEL INCENTIVES PROGRAMS

26:34.100 --> 26:36.834
AND ESTIMATED THAT SINCE 2009,

26:36.834 --> 26:37.900
AROUND 6600 JOBS HAD MOVED FROM

26:37.900 --> 26:39.500
MISSOURI TO KANSAS,

26:39.500 --> 26:41.734
WHILE AROUND 5500 JOBS HAD MOVED

26:41.734 --> 26:43.567
FROM KANSAS TO MISSOURI, MEANING

26:43.567 --> 26:44.800
THERE WAS A NET GAIN OF AROUND

26:44.800 --> 26:46.467
1100 JOBS ON THE KANSAS SIDE OF

26:46.467 --> 26:48.734
THE LINE AT A COMBINED COST TO

26:48.734 --> 26:52.500
THE TWO STATES OF $331 MILLION

26:52.500 --> 26:55.100
IN LOST TAX REVENUE.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.233
AND THINK ABOUT THAT.

26:56.233 --> 26:58.500
YOU COULD CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE

26:58.500 --> 27:00.800
THE FIRST 1100 PEOPLE TO MOVE TO

27:00.800 --> 27:02.467
KANSAS CITY FROM MISSOURI

27:02.467 --> 27:04.533
WOULD EACH GET A FERRARI,

27:04.533 --> 27:05.800
WHICH THEY COULD THEN DRIVE

27:05.800 --> 27:07.133
AROUND A GIANT PILE OF

27:07.133 --> 27:09.700
$30 MILLION THE STATE HAD ON

27:09.700 --> 27:10.967
FIRE, AND YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BE

27:10.967 --> 27:12.900
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE

27:12.900 --> 27:14.133
YOU WOULD'VE SAVED THE AREA

27:14.133 --> 27:16.633
$20 MILLION.

27:16.633 --> 27:18.834
LOOK, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT

27:18.834 --> 27:20.600
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE

27:20.600 --> 27:21.934
DONE IN A MUCH SMARTER WAY.

27:21.934 --> 27:22.834
AND I DON'T BLAME THE COMPANIES

27:22.834 --> 27:24.133
FOR THIS.

27:24.133 --> 27:25.000
BECAUSE IF GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING

27:25.000 --> 27:27.834
TO OFFER RIDICULOUS INCENTIVES,

27:27.834 --> 27:29.133
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THEM.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.600
SO GOVERNMENTS NEED TO HOLD

27:30.600 --> 27:31.900
THEMSELVES AND COMPANIES

27:31.900 --> 27:33.567
MORE ACCOUNTABLE.

27:33.567 --> 27:34.433
AND IF COMPANIES AREN'T

27:34.433 --> 27:35.400
PRODUCING WHAT THEY PROMISED,

27:35.400 --> 27:37.100
WE NEED A SYSTEM

27:37.100 --> 27:38.200
TO CLAW OUR MONEY BACK.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.767
BUT TO FIND THAT OUT,

27:39.767 --> 27:40.934
WE'RE GOING TO NEED MUCH MORE

27:40.934 --> 27:46.800
TRANSPARENCY OVER WHERE OUR

27:46.800 --> 27:47.367
AND WHAT WE'RE

27:47.367 --> 27:48.066
GETTING IN RETURN.

27:48.066 --> 27:48.734
ALTHOUGH I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING

27:48.734 --> 27:49.266
I KNOW FOR SURE WE GOT

27:49.266 --> 27:49.600
IN RETURN:

27:49.600 --> 27:52.667
THE "ENTOURAGE" MOVIE.

27:52.667 --> 27:53.900
THAT GOT A $5.8 MILLION

27:53.900 --> 27:57.000
TAX CREDIT FROM CALIFORNIA.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.033
AND WHERE ELSE WERE THEY GOING

28:02.033 --> 28:03.233
TO FILM ENTOURAGE?

28:03.233 --> 28:03.500
IDAHO?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.300
SO, CALIFORNIA, PLEASE KNOW --

28:05.300 --> 28:06.200
YOU INDIRECTLY HAD A HAND

28:06.200 --> 28:07.633
IN PRODUCING A MOVIE WHICH,

28:07.633 --> 28:08.834
MAY I REMIND YOU, HAS THIS

28:08.834 --> 28:14.734
FOR ITS VERY FIRST LINE.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.333
>> I MAY HAVE TO JERK IT BEFORE

28:17.333 --> 28:19.333
WE GET THERE.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.400
>> John: YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.033
CONGRATULATIONS,

28:23.033 --> 28:23.900
KENTUCKY ARK MUSEUM!

28:23.900 --> 28:24.433
SOMEHOW, YOU'VE BECOME THE

28:24.433 --> 28:25.066
SECOND-WORST TAXPAYER-SUBSIDIZED

28:25.066 --> 28:26.233
FUCK BOAT IN THIS STORY.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.600
AND NOW THIS.

28:29.600 --> 28:33.533
>> Announcer: AND NOW LET'S

28:33.533 --> 28:34.734
CHECK IN WITH HALLOWEEN TRAFFIC

28:34.734 --> 28:36.133
AND WEATHER.

28:36.133 --> 28:37.934
>> 33 DEGREES.

28:37.934 --> 28:40.300
THAT'S MAKING IT FEEL LIKE 24.

28:40.300 --> 28:43.734
>> THINGS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.934
>> A FEW CLOUDS, WE ARE

28:45.934 --> 28:46.900
EXPECTING SOME RAIN.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.734
>> 34 HERE BUT WE ARE TAPPING

28:49.734 --> 28:50.200
INTO COLD AIR.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.333
>> SUNDAY THERE'S A COLD FRONT

28:52.333 --> 28:52.734
COMING IN.

28:52.734 --> 28:55.734
I KNOW NONE OF YOU ARE TAKING IT

28:55.734 --> 28:56.367
SERIOUSLY.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.600
>> WE HAVE AN OVERTURNED

28:58.600 --> 28:58.867
SEMITRUCK.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.600
>> HEAVY DELAYS FROM

29:01.600 --> 29:03.834
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.

29:03.834 --> 29:08.133
>> THE WEATHERMAN.

29:08.133 --> 29:11.533
>> MY HEAD IS FLOATING.

29:11.533 --> 29:12.433
NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC HEADING AWAY

29:12.433 --> 29:13.934
FROM US.

29:13.934 --> 29:16.100
>> ZOMBIES IN THE FORECAST.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.800
>> THE SUSPECTS ARE CHARGED WITH

29:17.800 --> 29:20.133
ACCESSORY TO MURDER.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.900
>> WE ARE SEEING CLEAR SKIES.

29:23.900 --> 29:28.333
>> John: AND FINALLY TONIGHT,

29:28.333 --> 29:29.734
A QUICK WORD ON THE UNITED

29:29.734 --> 29:30.467
STATES POSTAL SERVICE.

29:30.467 --> 29:31.567
DRIVERS OF WINDOWLESS WHITE VANS

29:31.567 --> 29:37.767
YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRUST.

29:37.767 --> 29:40.400
THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS FALLEN ON

29:40.400 --> 29:41.300
HARD TIMES.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.000
IT'S MASSIVELY IN DEBT,

29:42.000 --> 29:42.633
AND LAST YEAR POSTED A LOSS OF

29:42.633 --> 29:43.567
$5.6 BILLION, WHICH IS HARDLY

29:43.567 --> 29:44.133
SURPRISING.

29:44.133 --> 29:45.266
WHY SEND A LETTER WHEN YOU CAN

29:45.266 --> 29:46.233
SEND AN EMAIL?

29:46.233 --> 29:47.567
I MEAN, YOU COULD SEND

29:47.567 --> 29:48.600
A TWO-SENTENCE LETTER IN THE

29:48.600 --> 29:50.000
MAIL TO YOUR FRIEND IN ALL

29:50.000 --> 29:51.834
LOWERCASE THAT READS:

29:51.834 --> 29:53.367
"HEY, FINALLY SAW "THE MARTIAN."

29:53.367 --> 29:55.100
IT WAS OKAY."

29:55.100 --> 29:56.266
BUT THAT WOULD BE

29:56.266 --> 29:59.066
BOTH INEFFICIENT AND WEIRD.

29:59.066 --> 30:00.266
SO THE POSTAL SERVICE IS

30:00.266 --> 30:01.166
CURRENTLY FIGHTING TO STAY

30:01.166 --> 30:02.734
RELEVANT AND COOL,

30:02.734 --> 30:03.500
WHICH IS HARD FOR AN

30:03.500 --> 30:05.633
ORGANIZATION WHOSE UNIFORMS

30:05.633 --> 30:06.233
MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE

30:06.233 --> 30:08.133
A SEXUAL PREDATOR ON SAFARI.

30:08.133 --> 30:09.967
STILL, THEY'RE TRYING TO GET

30:09.967 --> 30:14.433
THEMSELVES OUT THERE.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.433
AND ONE ATTEMPT IS INCREDIBLE.

30:16.433 --> 30:18.367
DID YOU KNOW THAT, SINCE 2015,

30:18.367 --> 30:19.900
THE POSTAL SERVICE HAD ITS OWN

30:19.900 --> 30:21.400
TELEVISION SHOW?

30:21.400 --> 30:22.433
IT'S ON SATURDAY MORNINGS,

30:22.433 --> 30:23.533
AND IT'S CALLED

30:23.533 --> 30:25.033
"THE INSPECTORS," AND WHILE

30:25.033 --> 30:31.367
IT AIRS ON CBS, IT'S THE ONLY

30:31.367 --> 30:31.867
PROGRAM WHOSE BUDGET IS

30:31.867 --> 30:32.433
FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.967
AND THE SHOW IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT

30:33.967 --> 30:35.200
YOU'D EXPECT IF A BUNCH OF CIVIL

30:35.200 --> 30:35.867
SERVANTS FROM THE POSTAL SERVICE

30:35.867 --> 30:36.467
HAD THEIR OWN SHOW.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.000
>> I'M PRESTON WAINWRIGHT

30:38.000 --> 30:38.700
AND THIS IS MY MOM AMANDA.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.900
SHE'S A UNITED STATES POSTAL

30:39.900 --> 30:41.000
INSPECTOR, WHICH MEANS

30:41.000 --> 30:42.266
SHE SOLVES ANY CRIME THAT USES

30:42.266 --> 30:44.667
THE MAIL.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.700
MY DAD WAS AN INSPECTOR TOO,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.200
ONE OF THE BEST, UNTIL I LOST

30:48.200 --> 30:49.200
HIM AND THE USE OF MY LEGS

30:49.200 --> 30:50.533
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.433
NOW I'M FOLLOWING MY OWN DREAM

30:52.433 --> 30:53.734
WITH AN INTERNSHIP IN THE CRIME

30:53.734 --> 30:54.300
LAB AND THE HELP OF MY BEST

30:54.300 --> 30:55.934
FRIENDS.

30:55.934 --> 31:00.533
TOGETHER WE ARE THE INSPECTORS.

31:00.533 --> 31:02.100
>> John: THE WHOLE THING'S

31:02.100 --> 31:03.967
BASICALLY A MIX OF TEENAGE

31:03.967 --> 31:06.033
SOAP OPERA, A POLICE PROCEDURAL,

31:06.033 --> 31:07.000
AND AN PSA ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT

31:07.000 --> 31:07.800
YOURSELF FROM VARIOUS

31:07.800 --> 31:09.767
MAIL-RELATED CRIMES,

31:09.767 --> 31:11.266
ALL OF WHICH AMOUNTS TO

31:11.266 --> 31:13.934
A KIND OF "CSI: MAILBOX."

31:13.934 --> 31:15.467
ITS STARS INCLUDE THIS GUY,

31:15.467 --> 31:17.433
WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE

31:17.433 --> 31:19.467
ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL.

31:19.467 --> 31:20.767
AND YOU MAY THINK I'M JUST

31:20.767 --> 31:21.834
CHERRYPICKING SIMILAR PHOTOS,

31:21.834 --> 31:23.834
BUT I'M NOT.

31:23.834 --> 31:25.734
THEIR PHOTOS ARE ALL SIMILAR.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.000
TELL ME, WHICH OF THESE ACTORS

31:27.000 --> 31:28.367
WAS IN THE "THE BREAKFAST CLUB"

31:28.367 --> 31:30.000
AND WHICH WASN'T?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.500
YOU CAN'T DO IT!

31:32.500 --> 31:33.967
THAT'S MY POINT.

31:33.967 --> 31:35.133
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S

31:35.133 --> 31:36.500
SOMETHING ABOUT THE INNATELY

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
AGGRESSIVE TONE OF A COP SHOW

31:38.500 --> 31:40.000
AND POSTAL INSPECTORS

31:40.000 --> 31:42.600
THAT DOESN'T QUITE FIT.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.133
>> I WANT TO SEE MY LAWYER.

31:44.133 --> 31:45.166
I KNOW MY RIGHTS AND I WILL NOT

31:45.166 --> 31:47.367
BE INTIMIDATED BY YOU PEOPLE.

31:47.367 --> 31:49.233
WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY, THE FBI?

31:49.233 --> 31:49.734
>> I TOLD YOU.

31:49.734 --> 31:51.233
WE'RE POSTAL INSPECTORS.

31:51.233 --> 31:52.967
>> WE'RE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

31:52.967 --> 31:54.900
WE'VE GOT A 98% CONVICTION RATE.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.667
YOU'RE ABOUT TO RAISE IT TO 99.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.133
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL:

31:59.133 --> 32:00.700
IF A POSTAL INSPECTOR IS YOUR

32:00.700 --> 32:02.834
WORST NIGHTMARE, YOU NEED TO

32:02.834 --> 32:05.333
HAVE WORSE NIGHTMARES.

32:05.333 --> 32:06.266
THERE'S A REASON FREDDY KREUGER

32:06.266 --> 32:07.934
KILLS PEOPLE.

32:07.934 --> 32:08.667
HE DOESN'T FINE THEM

32:08.667 --> 32:09.266
FOR MANUFACTURING COUNTERFEIT

32:09.266 --> 32:11.100
STAMPS.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.433
ALSO ABOUT THAT CONVICTION RATE

32:12.433 --> 32:13.834
LINE, THAT'S NOT HOW NUMBERS

32:13.834 --> 32:16.734
WORK.

32:16.734 --> 32:18.567
SAY THEY'VE CONVICTED 980 OUT

32:18.567 --> 32:19.800
OF 1,000 PEOPLE, GIVING THEM

32:19.800 --> 32:21.400
A 98% CONVICTION RATE.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.333
BY CONVICTING ONE MORE PERSON,

32:23.333 --> 32:25.433
THEIR RATE ISN'T NOW 99.

32:25.433 --> 32:26.233
IT'S 98.1.

32:26.233 --> 32:27.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:27.433 --> 32:28.667
I DON'T OFTEN SAY THIS ON THIS

32:28.667 --> 32:30.333
SHOW, BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS

32:30.333 --> 32:31.667
OUR OFFICIAL STAMP OF --

32:31.667 --> 32:33.233
NEVER MIND.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.467
NEVER MIND.

32:35.467 --> 32:38.266
DOESN'T MATTER.

32:38.266 --> 32:39.100
LET IT GO.

32:39.100 --> 32:39.934
NEVER MIND.

32:39.934 --> 32:40.967
NOW, THE EPISODES ARE 30 MINUTES

32:40.967 --> 32:42.367
LONG, BUT I CAN ACTUALLY RUN YOU

32:42.367 --> 32:43.633
THROUGH ONE PRETTY QUICKLY.

32:43.633 --> 32:44.233
A RECENT STORY FEATURED

32:44.233 --> 32:45.734
THE POSTAL INSPECTORS GETTING

32:45.734 --> 32:47.834
INVOLVED IN A CYBER-RANSOM CASE

32:47.834 --> 32:49.233
AFTER THEY FIND SOME EVIDENCE ON

32:49.233 --> 32:52.300
AN ENVELOPE, AND THEY WORK FAST.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.633
>> HOPEFULLY GEORGIA CAN MATCH

32:53.633 --> 32:54.266
THIS GUACAMOLE TO THE STUFF

32:54.266 --> 32:55.700
ON THE LETTER.

32:55.700 --> 32:56.467
>> OKAY, WE SHOULD HAVE

32:56.467 --> 32:57.800
THE RESULTS OF THE GUACAMOLE

32:57.800 --> 33:02.033
ANALYSIS IN A FEW MINUTES.

33:02.033 --> 33:02.734
>> AND THE ELEMENTS ON THE

33:02.734 --> 33:03.967
GUACAMOLE SAMPLE YOU BROUGHT IN

33:03.967 --> 33:04.867
TODAY IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE

33:04.867 --> 33:06.567
GUAC ON THE ENVELOPE.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.266
>> FIESTA'S OVER, FRANK.

33:07.266 --> 33:08.633
>> AH.

33:08.633 --> 33:09.667
U.S. POSTAL INSPECTORS

33:09.667 --> 33:10.700
UP AGAINST THE TACO TRUCK.

33:10.700 --> 33:16.533
>> OH, MAN.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.166
>> John: SO THAT'S JUST SOLIDLY

33:18.166 --> 33:19.166
WRITTEN DIALOGUE, EXCEPT FOR

33:19.166 --> 33:20.100
THE PART WHEN THE GUY SAYS,

33:20.100 --> 33:21.900
"OH, MAN."

33:21.900 --> 33:23.033
BECAUSE IF SOMEONE WHIPS OUT

33:23.033 --> 33:25.400
A BADGE AND YELLS, "U.S. POSTAL

33:25.400 --> 33:26.467
INSPECTORS," THE ONLY NATURAL

33:26.467 --> 33:27.767
REACTION IS GOING TO BE,

33:27.767 --> 33:30.233
"YOU GUYS HAVE BADGES?

33:30.233 --> 33:31.934
WHY?"

33:31.934 --> 33:33.633
BUT LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

33:33.633 --> 33:34.967
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE CASES.

33:34.967 --> 33:35.934
THIS IS A SHOW THAT WANTS YOU

33:35.934 --> 33:37.333
TO INVEST IN THE HISTORIES

33:37.333 --> 33:38.600
AND COMPLEX EMOTIONS

33:38.600 --> 33:40.900
OF ITS CHARACTERS.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.166
>> WITH ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR

33:42.166 --> 33:44.333
THIS PARTY, WELL, I JUST

33:44.333 --> 33:45.367
PLUM FORGOT TO GET YOU SOMETHING

33:45.367 --> 33:47.600
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.100
YOU'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT IT,

33:50.100 --> 33:52.467
SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

33:52.467 --> 33:53.667
I'D JUST, I'D TELL YOU WHY

33:53.667 --> 33:54.734
I BECAME A LETTER CARRIER

33:54.734 --> 33:56.066
AFTER THE MILITARY.

33:56.066 --> 33:58.700
SEE, WHILE I WAS DEPLOYED

33:58.700 --> 34:02.333
OVERSEAS, EVERY DAY I SAW

34:02.333 --> 34:05.066
HOW IMPORTANT A LETTER

34:05.066 --> 34:07.567
OR A CARE PACKAGE FROM HOME

34:07.567 --> 34:10.066
COULD BE TO A SOLDIER WHO WAS

34:10.066 --> 34:14.767
TIRED OR SCARED OR WAS MISSING

34:14.767 --> 34:19.033
HOME, AND I JUST, MADE ALL

34:19.033 --> 34:21.500
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD,

34:21.500 --> 34:22.934
AND I KNEW THAT WHEN I GOT HOME,

34:22.934 --> 34:25.367
I WANTED TO BE A PART OF THAT

34:25.367 --> 34:28.266
SMILE EVERY DAY.

34:28.266 --> 34:32.767
SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

34:32.767 --> 34:34.533
>> John: THAT IS OFFICIALLY

34:34.533 --> 34:35.300
THE WORLD'S SHITTIEST BIRTHDAY

34:35.300 --> 34:37.433
PRESENT.

34:37.433 --> 34:38.567
"SORRY I COULDN'T GET YOU

34:38.567 --> 34:40.200
A GIFT, BUT HOW ABOUT I MAKE YOU

34:40.200 --> 34:41.500
STAND THERE FOR WHAT WILL FEEL

34:41.500 --> 34:42.266
LIKE AN ETERNITY WHILE I TEAR UP

34:42.266 --> 34:43.934
TALKING ABOUT MAIL?

34:43.934 --> 34:48.433
THAT'S A GIFT, RIGHT?"

34:48.433 --> 34:51.433
I JUST GAVE YOU SOMETHING.

34:51.433 --> 34:52.133
THE POSTAL SERVICE EVEN MADE

34:52.133 --> 34:52.700
THEIR OWN BEHIND-THE-SCENES

34:52.700 --> 34:53.133
VIDEO ON THE SET OF

34:53.133 --> 34:53.800
"THE INSPECTORS," FEATURING

34:53.800 --> 34:55.400
ANTHONY BOOTLEG HALL AND THE

34:55.400 --> 34:56.600
REST OF THE CAST TALKING ABOUT

34:56.600 --> 34:59.467
WHAT A GREAT AGENCY THE USPS IS.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.133
BUT THE BEST AND SADDEST PART

35:01.133 --> 35:02.133
IS WHEN THEY INTERVIEW THE

35:02.133 --> 35:04.033
REAL-LIFE CHIEF POSTAL INSPECTOR

35:04.033 --> 35:05.700
GUY COTTRELL, WHO HAS AN

35:05.700 --> 35:06.467
INTERESTING ASSESSMENT OF HIS

35:06.467 --> 35:09.367
OWN STATUS IN HOLLYWOOD.

35:09.367 --> 35:10.734
>> I CAME HERE STAR STRUCK

35:10.734 --> 35:13.166
LOOKING AT THE ACTORS, AND THE

35:13.166 --> 35:15.367
ACTORS LOOK AT ME AND THE REST

35:15.367 --> 35:17.266
OF THE INSPECTORS HERE JUST AS

35:17.266 --> 35:18.600
STAR STRUCK BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY

35:18.600 --> 35:19.533
THE POSTAL INSPECTORS

35:19.533 --> 35:21.734
DOING THE WORK.

35:21.734 --> 35:22.800
SO AS COOL AS IT IS FOR US TO

35:22.800 --> 35:24.633
SEE A TV SHOW, IT'S JUST AS COOL

35:24.633 --> 35:26.500
FOR THEM TO SEE REAL POSTAL

35:26.500 --> 35:28.867
INSPECTORS.

35:28.867 --> 35:29.900
>> John: NO.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.867
NO, IT ISN'T.

35:32.867 --> 35:33.834
YOU'RE WRONG.

35:33.834 --> 35:34.734
YOU HAVE BADLY MISINTERPRETED

35:34.734 --> 35:36.066
THE TONE OF THE ACTOR WHO FOUND

35:36.066 --> 35:37.800
OUT HE HAD TO MEET WITH YOU

35:37.800 --> 35:38.900
AND SAID, "WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE

35:38.900 --> 35:41.533
THIS IS HAPPENING."

35:41.533 --> 35:42.300
NOW, AS THIS IS A SATURDAY

35:42.300 --> 35:43.767
MORNING PROGRAM, IT IS IDEALLY

35:43.767 --> 35:45.033
SUPPOSED TO BE GEARED

35:45.033 --> 35:46.200
TOWARDS KIDS AND TEENS.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.233
AND YET, WE CHECKED, AND THE

35:47.233 --> 35:48.633
MAIN AUDIENCE FOR THE SHOW

35:48.633 --> 35:51.133
IS 55 AND OLDER,

35:51.133 --> 35:53.000
WHICH IS NOT IDEAL.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.433
BECAUSE THE POSTAL SERVICE NEEDS

35:54.433 --> 35:57.633
TO GET ITS MESSAGE OUT.

35:57.633 --> 35:58.433
THE POINT OF THE SHOW IS

35:58.433 --> 35:59.233
TO EDUCATE VIEWERS ABOUT THINGS

35:59.233 --> 36:01.233
LIKE MAIL FRAUD, IDENTITY THEFT,

36:01.233 --> 36:02.033
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF POSTAL

36:02.033 --> 36:03.633
INSPECTORS.

36:03.633 --> 36:04.934
BUT IT CAN'T DO THAT IF IT ISN'T

36:04.934 --> 36:07.033
REACHING THE RIGHT AUDIENCE.

36:07.033 --> 36:08.900
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS INSERT

36:08.900 --> 36:09.767
THEIR MESSAGE INTO EXISTING,

36:09.767 --> 36:11.500
POPULAR SHOWS.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.567
AND HERE'S WHERE WE COME IN.

36:13.567 --> 36:14.667
BECAUSE WE'VE CALLED IN A FEW

36:14.667 --> 36:15.834
FAVORS FROM SOME OF THE MOST

36:15.834 --> 36:17.066
POPULAR SHOWS AROUND,

36:17.066 --> 36:19.467
AND THEY AGREED TO HELP OUT.

36:19.467 --> 36:28.467
FIRST THERE'S THIS.

36:28.467 --> 36:33.834
>> LAYLA MCQUEEN.

36:33.834 --> 36:38.100
YOU STAY.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.200
I NOTICED YOU FORGOT TO CHECK

36:39.200 --> 36:42.834
FOR WATERMARKS ON POSTAL MONEY

36:42.834 --> 36:46.867
ORDERS AND FAILED TO TURN ON TWO

36:46.867 --> 36:49.900
STEP VERIFICATION.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.767
THE POSTAL SERVICE CAN HELP YOU

36:51.767 --> 36:53.266
AVOID SCAMS BUT IF YOU CAN'T

36:53.266 --> 36:55.133
LOVE YOURSELF, HOW ARE YOU GOING

36:55.133 --> 36:57.834
TO BE TRULY SAFE FROM IDENTITY

36:57.834 --> 36:58.800
THEFT?

36:58.800 --> 37:01.767
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.633
>> John: TELL ME THAT'S NOT

37:03.633 --> 37:04.800
EDUCATIONAL AND FIERCE.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.767
YOU CAN'T.

37:08.767 --> 37:09.633
BECAUSE IT IS BOTH!

37:09.633 --> 37:10.133
BUT NOT EVERYONE WATCHES

37:10.133 --> 37:11.033
REALITY SHOWS.

37:11.033 --> 37:12.200
WHAT PEOPLE DO WATCH IS

37:12.200 --> 37:13.233
"THIS IS US", WHICH MAKES YOU

37:13.233 --> 37:15.200
LAUGH AND MAKES YOU CRY

37:15.200 --> 37:16.333
AND MAKES YOU WONDER WHEN THE

37:16.333 --> 37:17.433
FUCK THEY'RE GOING TO EXPLAIN

37:17.433 --> 37:18.867
HOW THE FATHER DIES.

37:18.867 --> 37:20.000
WHY WON'T YOU TELL US,

37:20.000 --> 37:23.066
YOU MONSTERS?

37:23.066 --> 37:24.533
TELL US!

37:24.533 --> 37:25.967
ANYWAY, IF YOU COULD SNEAK SOME

37:25.967 --> 37:27.600
MAIL-RELATED DIALOGUE INTO THAT

37:27.600 --> 37:28.533
ONE, THAT'D BE PRETTY AMAZING,

37:28.533 --> 37:29.633
RIGHT?

37:29.633 --> 37:32.867
TAKE A LOOK.

37:32.867 --> 37:34.834
>> HEY, BABE.

37:34.834 --> 37:37.066
HEY, DID YOU GET THE MAIL TODAY?

37:37.066 --> 37:37.900
>> I DID, AND ONCE AGAIN,

37:37.900 --> 37:38.700
NO SUSPICIOUS OR FRAUDULENT

37:38.700 --> 37:43.133
PACKAGES IN IT.

37:43.133 --> 37:45.367
>> IT'S A GOOD THING WE HAVE A

37:45.367 --> 37:49.033
POSTAL INSPECTION SERVICE OR I

37:49.033 --> 37:53.433
COULD BE KILLED BY A MAIL BOMB

37:53.433 --> 37:56.900
>> THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.367
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT HOW I

37:58.367 --> 37:59.934
DIE.

37:59.934 --> 38:00.767
>> EVEN IF YOU DIED A PREMATURE

38:00.767 --> 38:02.533
DEATH, I DOUBT IT WOULD BE FROM

38:02.533 --> 38:05.800
A MAIL BOMB.

38:05.800 --> 38:06.700
>> I'M GOING TO LIVE FOREVER.

38:06.700 --> 38:07.367
>> John: SEE?

38:07.367 --> 38:08.934
PERFECT.

38:08.934 --> 38:11.200
THE KEY, AS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN

38:11.200 --> 38:12.600
SO FAR, IS TO DO IT SUBTLY,

38:12.600 --> 38:14.033
JUST MAKE IT A COMPLETELY NORMAL

38:14.033 --> 38:15.066
PART OF A COMPLETELY NORMAL

38:15.066 --> 38:19.567
SCENE.

38:19.567 --> 38:20.567
>> I AM TELLING YOU, IT IS LIKE

38:20.567 --> 38:21.233
THE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO KEEP US

38:21.233 --> 38:21.934
IN HERE.

38:21.934 --> 38:23.033
>> DUH.

38:23.033 --> 38:23.633
IT IS THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL

38:23.633 --> 38:29.834
COMPLEX.

38:29.834 --> 38:31.400
>> EASE UP.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.066
NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE

38:32.066 --> 38:32.800
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BAD.

38:32.800 --> 38:33.367
LET US NOT FORGET ABOUT THE

38:33.367 --> 38:34.133
HARDWORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF THE

38:34.133 --> 38:34.767
UNITED STATES POSTAL INSPECTION

38:34.767 --> 38:36.100
SERVICE.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.567
>> THAT IS TRUE.

38:38.567 --> 38:42.367
THEY GUARD US.

38:42.367 --> 38:46.133
FROM SERIOUS CRIMES.

38:46.133 --> 38:49.400
>> THE USPIS IS TRASH.

38:49.400 --> 38:53.567
>> YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

38:53.567 --> 38:56.600
YOU DON'T KNOW THE USPIS.

38:56.600 --> 38:57.300
>> I TOLD YOU TO NOT BE

38:57.300 --> 38:57.834
DISRESPECTING THE POSTAL

38:57.834 --> 38:58.400
INSPECTORS IN FRONT OF HER.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.000
>> IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

39:00.000 --> 39:03.700
MORE, SIMPLY CALL

39:03.700 --> 39:06.800
1-877-876-2455.

39:06.800 --> 39:07.734
>> ALL RIGHT.

39:07.734 --> 39:10.000
I WILL CALL THEM TODAY.

39:10.000 --> 39:10.500
>> John: YOU'RE WELCOME,

39:10.500 --> 39:13.533
POSTAL SERVICE!

39:13.533 --> 39:14.900
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

39:14.900 --> 39:15.700
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

GOOD NIGHT!
