So he's doing whatever he wants
over in hispaniola,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.664
While just one island over
in puerto rico,

11:39.666 --> 11:43.635
Ponce de león is, like,
skipping around with the people.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.036
He's like, hey, what's up?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.105
And they're like,
hey, ponce!

11:47.107 --> 11:50.008
Cerón and díaz
go over to puerto rico

11:50.010 --> 11:54.012
And kick ponce de león
out of power and are like,

11:54.014 --> 11:55.146
We're in charge now.

11:55.148 --> 11:55.880
They're barbaric.

11:55.882 --> 12:00.251
They're enslaving the people,
being super douches.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.554
So ponce de león is like,

12:02.556 --> 12:06.057
I can't witness my people
just being, like,

12:06.059 --> 12:08.526
Totally treated [bleep]
like this.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.629
So he gathers up some of
his spanish men, and he's like,

12:11.631 --> 12:15.366
You know what, let's [bleep]
chain these [bleeps]

12:15.368 --> 12:18.336
And send them back to Spain.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.973
And king ferdinand is like,
what the [bleep] are you doing?

12:21.975 --> 12:22.707
Like, I get it.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.743
These guys are assholes,
but...

12:24.745 --> 12:25.877
You don't have the power
to do that.

12:25.879 --> 12:31.483
So juan cerón and miguel díaz
are--go back to puerto rico.

12:31.485 --> 12:36.121
And ponce de león's like,
king ferdinand, fine.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.457
If I can't have puerto rico,
there's this other island

12:39.459 --> 12:45.663
To the north, west a little bit,
that is just as full of gold,

12:45.665 --> 12:48.066
And the land is
just as bountiful.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.968
And he says, okay,
go do your thing.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.403
So ponce de león is like,
all right, sweet.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.505
So it takes him
a couple of months,

12:53.507 --> 12:56.407
And he gets together a ship
and a group of spaniards.

12:56.409 --> 13:00.745
In 1513, he sets sail
in the wide open waters

13:00.747 --> 13:04.449
Of the atlantic ocean
for this mystery island.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.719
A month later he sees land.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.988
As he sees it, he realizes,
you know what?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.090
Christopher columbus
has never been here.

13:12.092 --> 13:17.362
I'm the first nonnative
to come across this land.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.998
And not just that...

13:22.802 --> 13:23.668
Hmm.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.436
[laughs]
I lost it.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.172
So he shows up, and he's like,
oh, my god,

13:27.174 --> 13:31.209
I'm the first non-indigenous
person to show up on this land.

13:31.211 --> 13:36.447
Sets down the spanish flag,
unrolls it, and is like,

13:36.449 --> 13:41.186
I hereby proclaim this land
as being spanish.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.922
And I call it...

13:43.924 --> 13:45.456
La florida.

13:45.458 --> 13:50.595
And there he's left
to make this land his own...

13:50.597 --> 13:53.131
Till the end of time.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.635
[both sigh]

13:59.438 --> 14:01.206
[bleep] history.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.347
Oh, yeah!

14:09.349 --> 14:12.784
Yeah! Whoo!

14:12.786 --> 14:14.552
Where's that gator?

14:14.554 --> 14:16.521
Yeah, I don't know
where he went.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.290
I can see why all the murder
mysteries have stories

14:19.292 --> 14:21.759
About people dropping bodies
in here, though.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.028
Yeah, I'm still trying to find
my first wife.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.231
[laughs]
no.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.800
As a host of<i> drunk history,</i>
I'm saying, all right,

14:28.802 --> 14:29.734
Now you match me.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.436
Let's just chug this.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.439
Mm-hmm.
Mmm. Mm.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.675
[chuckles]

14:37.677 --> 14:40.511
Hey.
[laughs]

14:40.513 --> 14:41.179
Hello.

14:41.181 --> 14:45.383
Hello, I'm dan harmon,
and today I'd like to tell you

14:45.385 --> 14:48.453
The story of griselda blanco,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.556
The godmother of cocaine.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.690
[slurps]

14:52.692 --> 14:56.160
So griselda blanco
marries alberto bravo,

14:56.162 --> 14:59.530
A cocaine dealer
from the medellin cartel.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.700
And griselda loves him,
they get married,

15:02.702 --> 15:05.803
And we're gonna pursue
the american dream

15:05.805 --> 15:06.838
And go to america.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.808
They, uh, they bring cocaine
to new york.

15:10.810 --> 15:11.776
Ka-boom!

15:11.778 --> 15:14.812
Welcome to 1970s america,

15:14.814 --> 15:16.481
Where everyone is on cocaine.

15:16.483 --> 15:21.552
Athletes, police, meter maids,
your uncle.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.955
Everyone's on cocaine
is my point.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.156
So many people are on cocaine,

15:25.158 --> 15:27.959
The nypd and dea
form a task force.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.727
You gotta stop
this [bleep] cocaine.

15:29.729 --> 15:34.799
Hey, bob palombo,
head of the new dea task force,

15:34.801 --> 15:36.634
Operation banshee,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.803
Stop this cocaine!

15:38.805 --> 15:40.872
Bob palombo goes,
okay, I'm on it.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.206
Let's do it.
I'm gonna do it.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.076
I got my shoulder holster.
I got my badge.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.544
I got my cocaine training.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.080
I'm gonna go bust
some cocaine people.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.281
He goes out.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.885
Alberto bravo [bleep]
bails on his wife.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.687
He leaves griselda high and dry.

15:55.689 --> 15:59.257
She opens the books
and realizes, holy [bleep],

15:59.259 --> 16:03.328
This [bleep] guy that I trusted,
exchanged vows with,

16:03.330 --> 16:09.367
He stole millions from me
and then bailed on me.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.802
She calls her husband.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.871
Hey...Ass master.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.773
[derek and dan laugh]

16:15.775 --> 16:18.810
(dan)
could we...Hook up,

16:18.812 --> 16:21.579
Talk about the elephants

16:21.581 --> 16:23.414
In the various rooms?

16:23.416 --> 16:25.516
- Let's chug this.
- Chug this?

16:25.518 --> 16:28.019
- Yeah! Come on.
- Okay.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.456
We're in miami.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.726
I mean, that's gonna...

16:34.728 --> 16:37.028
- That's a threshold.
- Mmm.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.864
(dan)
she makes her own way
to colombia.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.934
Griselda pulls up in a car
by herself.

16:42.936 --> 16:46.504
She gets out of the car.
She points at him.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.139
You [bleep] me!

16:48.141 --> 16:51.075
We dealt cocaine together
in new york.

16:51.077 --> 16:51.843
We dominated.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.979
The dea moved in,
and you [bleep] me.

16:54.981 --> 16:59.283
He's like, hey, whoa, man,
you don't need to be so harsh.

16:59.285 --> 17:00.084
[bleep] come on, baby,

17:00.086 --> 17:01.953
[bleep], [bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

17:01.955 --> 17:04.455
He goes for his uzi,
which is in his belt.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.792
She goes for her pistol,
which is in her boot.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.795
She gets shot in the gut
with one uzi bullet.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.031
Oh! Ow!
My gut.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.501
She shoots him in the face
with her pistol.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.002
She takes his uzi.

17:18.004 --> 17:21.406
She shoots
all of his six bodyguards

17:21.408 --> 17:25.543
And emerges as the only survivor
of the entire scene

17:25.545 --> 17:29.247
And earns the nickname
the black widow.

17:29.249 --> 17:33.284
Now she makes
her biggest [bleep] move of all.

17:33.286 --> 17:38.456
She goes, let's go
to the virgin city, "me-ami."

17:38.458 --> 17:39.624
Come on, dan.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.726
Are you gonna do pushups?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.294
Maybe.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.797
I can't see you,
by the way.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.099
I can see two of you.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.874
Um, so she, uh--
she goes to miami.

17:56.876 --> 17:57.575
[dance music]

17:57.577 --> 18:00.845
Now, this is a town very thirsty
for cocaine.

18:00.847 --> 18:01.546
Here comes griselda.

18:01.548 --> 18:06.617
She invents a little concept
called the motorcycle drive-by.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.753
Miami has gone insane.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.556
The murder rate
has tripled overnight,

18:11.558 --> 18:14.058
And most of it are people
that griselda

18:14.060 --> 18:16.594
Is either murdering
or having murdered.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.297
Meanwhile,
dea agent bob palombo,

18:19.299 --> 18:23.234
He says to his colleagues,
when I arrest this woman,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.203
I'm gonna kiss her
on the mouth. Mmm.

18:25.205 --> 18:30.308
His colleagues are like, oh,
did you hear what bob said?

18:30.310 --> 18:34.278
Yeah, the mouth-kissing thing?
Yeah.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.013
Having no more battles
left to win,

18:36.015 --> 18:38.683
She starts getting high
on her own supply.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.720
Griselda starts holing herself
up in her mansion.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.124
Meanwhile, the dea is
closing in enough,

18:46.126 --> 18:49.861
She sees the writing
on the rall--on the rall.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.996
She sees the writing
on the wall.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.399
She flees to irvine, california.

18:55.401 --> 18:59.804
So she's sitting
in her irvine, california, home.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.707
The dea is closing in.

19:02.709 --> 19:06.110
Griselda, we know
you're in there.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.945
Guess what bob palombo does.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.547
He marches up to her,
kisses her.

19:09.549 --> 19:14.652
And all of his coworkers are
like, wow, look what bob did.

19:14.654 --> 19:18.456
He sexualized his quarry.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.625
Ugh, gross.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.861
So she pleads guilty

19:23.863 --> 19:26.264
To 3 of the 240 murders

19:26.266 --> 19:28.866
That she may be
"guiltiable" about,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.936
An exchange for which
she gets 20 years in prison.

19:31.938 --> 19:36.674
2011--correct the chyron
if we find out that's not true--

19:36.676 --> 19:39.744
She gets deported back
to colombia,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.712
In her hometown of medellin,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.048
The town that made her
what she is.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.284
She's outside a butcher shop.

19:46.286 --> 19:52.456
She is gunned down
by two assassins...

19:52.458 --> 19:54.725
On a motorcycle.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.360
(derek)
would that be...

19:56.362 --> 20:00.364
(dan)
a motorcycle drive-by? Yeah.

20:00.366 --> 20:03.067
The fact that she died
by something that

20:03.069 --> 20:06.504
Wouldn't have existed
had she not existed,

20:06.506 --> 20:10.041
That's...Total irony.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.843
This is--this is like
if thomas edison, uh,

20:12.845 --> 20:16.047
After his long life,
was strangled in his sleep

20:16.049 --> 20:17.348
- By a light bulb.
- [laughs]

20:17.350 --> 20:21.485
Like [bleep] ben franklin
being killed by a glowing key.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.988
Would it be like
george foreman...

20:23.990 --> 20:28.492
- Getting grilled to death?
- Being thrown and grilled?

20:28.494 --> 20:31.862
And all of his fat
dripping down

20:31.864 --> 20:35.266
Angled troughs
into a [bleep] plastic bin?

20:35.268 --> 20:38.903
- By all his challenges?
