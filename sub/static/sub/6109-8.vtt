03:18.616 --> 03:19.909
Well, I can't thank you enough

03:20.076 --> 03:22.245
for arranging this
on such short notice.

03:22.412 --> 03:23.705
At times like these,

03:23.872 --> 03:25.748
we have to move quickly
and stick together.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.709
So true.

03:27.876 --> 03:30.003
Well, I've climbed
Mt Everest twice,

03:30.169 --> 03:32.338
and that's not something
one does on one's own.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.215
Beating this disease is...

03:34.382 --> 03:36.217
..it's an even taller mountain
to climb.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.596
Well, think of Godfrey as
the Sherpa on whose back, um...

03:39.762 --> 03:43.141
..Hillary...somebody
rode to Everest's summit.

03:43.308 --> 03:44.434
Huh.

03:44.601 --> 03:48.980
Well, Sir Edmund didn't actually
ride on Tenzing Norgay's back.

03:49.147 --> 03:51.900
Well, however he got there,
we'll be right there with you.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.192
Right.

03:56.905 --> 03:58.531
Norville Knox.

04:00.325 --> 04:02.744
Godfrey's very own Tenha Norway.

04:02.911 --> 04:06.331
Dr Johann Pryce, of course.
I'm an aficionado of your work.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.416
Your paper
on glycosylated haemoglobin

04:08.583 --> 04:11.210
led to some delicious advances
by my own team.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.630
It is an absolute honour
to meet you, sir.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.131
May I congratulate you

04:15.298 --> 04:17.382
for having utterly
transmogrified philanthropy

04:17.550 --> 04:19.302
from a guilt-driven hobby
of the privileged

04:19.469 --> 04:21.471
to a dynamic
and transformative tool

04:21.637 --> 04:23.097
that, when systematically
deployed

04:23.264 --> 04:25.516
as you have done with
such insight and discipline,

04:25.683 --> 04:28.645
has activated and energised
the scientific community

04:28.811 --> 04:30.897
to levels of discovery
and innovation

04:31.064 --> 04:32.440
never thought possible.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.233
Why don't you just blow the guy?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.778
At least a dick
in his obsequious little mouth

04:36.945 --> 04:38.780
would shut him up.

04:39.948 --> 04:40.949
What?

04:41.115 --> 04:43.242
Well, I'm delighted
that a man of your stature

04:43.409 --> 04:45.578
is just looking
into this wretched disease.

04:45.745 --> 04:48.831
- Now, is Dr Pryce...
- Upir? No.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.750
Though the body count
he's racked up

04:50.917 --> 04:52.710
beats both of ours, combined.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.837
In the name of science,
of course.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.925
Uh, may I?

04:59.092 --> 05:01.010
Yes, please. By all means.

05:02.595 --> 05:04.764
I'll ask you to keep the fawning
to a minimum

05:04.931 --> 05:07.016
when it's me in that body.

05:07.183 --> 05:09.477
No. You're not planning... Him?

05:09.644 --> 05:12.438
Handsome? Check. Upir? Check.
Rich? Double check.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.941
When you called, you said he was
coming to help. I thought...

05:15.108 --> 05:16.776
I was sitting next to him
on his plane.

05:16.943 --> 05:18.403
What else was I supposed to say?

05:18.569 --> 05:20.738
If we wipe his brain, it'll
destroy everything I believe in.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.615
So it's a short list, then.

05:22.782 --> 05:24.200
This man is responsible

05:24.367 --> 05:25.785
for shaping the future
of our civilisation

05:25.952 --> 05:27.662
through his patronage
to science.

05:27.829 --> 05:31.249
And yet, somehow that future
never seemed to include you.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.334
No. I have access
to the Godfrey funds.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.253
The White Tower.
I want for nothing.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.754
Use your imagination.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.715
His resources. His facilities.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.633
They could all be ours.

05:41.843 --> 05:43.469
Well, yours.

05:44.804 --> 05:46.764
Or I'll just feast on him.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.267
The scientific community

05:49.434 --> 05:51.269
will crumble
without his largesse,

05:51.436 --> 05:53.271
I will die
without a surrogate body,

05:53.438 --> 05:56.149
and your demonic perversions
masquerading as science

05:56.315 --> 05:59.193
will be exposed
for the whole world to see.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.157
Impressive discovery,
Pryce.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.992
With our combined resources,

06:06.159 --> 06:08.953
this thing doesn't stand
a chance.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.663
Quite so.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.459
Uh. Ugh!

06:16.461 --> 06:18.087
Jesus, Johann!
Be a little more careful

06:18.254 --> 06:19.881
with my new body,
will you, please?

06:20.048 --> 06:22.842
It's not yours. Not yet.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.343
Certain threats were made

06:24.510 --> 06:25.887
about sharing the fruits
of my labour -

06:26.054 --> 06:27.388
'atrocities' I believe you
called them -

06:27.555 --> 06:28.848
with the authorities.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.392
I'm putting my life
in your bloody little hands.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.394
Some insurance is only prudent.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.854
When I'm certain you've held up

06:35.021 --> 06:36.856
your end of the bargain,
I won't need leverage.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.691
I'll perform the transfer.

06:38.858 --> 06:40.359
You turn over whatever
information you have.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.695
Do we have a deal?

06:42.862 --> 06:44.489
I need to hear you
say the words.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.117
Oh, for fuck's sake! You're
such a suspicious little prick.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.163
Yes, we have a deal.

07:10.223 --> 07:11.849
<i>This is your Destiny.</i>

07:12.016 --> 07:13.518
<i>I already know
why you're calling,</i>

07:13.684 --> 07:14.977
<i>but if you're feeling
redundant,</i>

07:15.144 --> 07:16.604
<i>state your need after the beep.</i>

07:27.698 --> 07:30.827
Dee? Honey? I got us breakfast.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.663
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

07:33.830 --> 07:35.873
She didn't come home last night.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.834
I thought maybe
she crashed at your place.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.627
Well, she didn't.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.462
Where could she be?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.714
After all the lies
you've been telling her,

07:43.881 --> 07:45.174
maybe she's on a bender.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.051
Destiny wouldn't do that.

07:49.095 --> 07:51.097
And I came here to tell her
the whole story.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.599
Which version?

07:53.766 --> 07:55.059
Bet your ass is covered,

07:55.226 --> 07:58.229
no matter what crock of shit
you and Baj are telling, anyway.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.190
I'm here every morning,

08:01.357 --> 08:04.610
and I watch her cry
until there's nothing left.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.280
I listen to her trying
to figure out how her cousin

08:07.446 --> 08:09.073
could break her heart like this.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.576
I'm there for her.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.870
And you?

08:14.036 --> 08:16.205
Ride or die?

08:16.372 --> 08:18.374
Go fuck yourself.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.876
I can't go back in time.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.128
I can only find her
and make things better.

08:22.295 --> 08:24.839
You want to know what Destiny
was like before you showed up?

08:25.006 --> 08:26.883
She was happy.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.931
And all you found out
about this cabin

08:34.097 --> 08:35.558
is that it's not
in Connecticut?

08:35.725 --> 08:38.394
With Spivak's connection
to Essex and Plum Island nearby,

08:38.561 --> 08:40.104
it seemed reasonable
to assume that...

08:40.270 --> 08:41.731
Quit your yammering.
You have nothing.

08:41.898 --> 08:43.191
I do not have nothing.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.526
I've a blinding headache
and a fucking facial tic

08:45.693 --> 08:47.987
from playing 'Where's Waldo'
for the last 37 hours straight.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.323
Do you think I give a fuck?

08:50.489 --> 08:51.908
If you can't find this place,

08:52.074 --> 08:54.702
I'll shitcan you myself
and find someone who can.

09:11.636 --> 09:13.221
You gonna kill me now?

09:17.767 --> 09:19.894
I'm not a murderer.

09:36.327 --> 09:39.789
Go on. Get it over with.

09:39.956 --> 09:42.124
I'll make it easy for you.

09:44.460 --> 09:46.337
I'm not a murderer.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.759
You saw what happened.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.552
She came in here
shrieking at me

09:53.719 --> 09:55.054
after I was almost gunned down.

09:55.221 --> 09:56.847
Then she hit me.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.975
And I shouldn't have
hit her back,

09:59.141 --> 10:00.601
but no way did I mean for...

10:00.768 --> 10:03.562
- What about after that?
- She was dying.

10:05.064 --> 10:06.649
If Peter saw her like that,

10:06.816 --> 10:09.527
it wouldn't have mattered
if it was an accident or not.

10:09.694 --> 10:12.863
He would have come after me
until one of us was dead.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.865
And he wouldn't have stopped
with just me.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.118
You were there, too.

10:17.285 --> 10:19.370
I didn't have a choice.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.372
You have to understand that.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.085
I understand, Roman.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.587
I do.

10:28.754 --> 10:31.173
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.384
But you did,

10:33.551 --> 10:36.220
and you'll have to learn
to live with that.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.518
I took many lives
when I was finding my way.

10:42.685 --> 10:46.230
It wasn't until I turned my life
over to the will of God

10:46.397 --> 10:49.191
that I was able
to accept myself...

10:50.818 --> 10:53.112
..in spite of what I'd done.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.825
Penance.

10:57.992 --> 10:59.368
Atonement.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.662
Forgiveness.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.664
These aren't just words.

11:03.831 --> 11:07.168
That shit doesn't work for me.

11:07.335 --> 11:10.171
A fucking priest man
told me so himself.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.174
I don't know
what this priest told you

11:13.341 --> 11:16.427
or what you think you heard,
but I do know this -

11:16.594 --> 11:20.014
"There are many rooms
in my father's house."

11:23.100 --> 11:24.935
Room for me?

11:25.936 --> 11:29.940
I'm 100% certain
there's no room at the inn.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.446
Fuck.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.448
Remember what happens
if he finds out.

11:37.615 --> 11:39.325
To him. To you.

11:45.915 --> 11:48.376
Destiny didn't come home
last night. Is she here?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.961
I haven't seen her
since the funeral.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.463
Please excuse me.

11:52.630 --> 11:56.300
Sorry I have to leave so soon
but I'm late for an appointment.

11:56.467 --> 11:59.261
What about you?
Did she reach out to you?

12:02.348 --> 12:04.141
No, she didn't.

12:10.439 --> 12:13.734
Destiny probably just needs
some space after all this.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.111
She'll turn up.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.905
Come on,
I got something to show you.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.658
- This was in Trevor's head?
- So was I.

12:21.951 --> 12:24.495
I saw all of it.
The cabin, Spivak, everything.

12:28.082 --> 12:31.252
- This is big.
- We're so close.

12:31.419 --> 12:33.546
We should head over
to the White Tower

12:33.712 --> 12:36.340
and keep the pressure on them
to find this place.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.261
I can't do anything
until I know where Destiny is.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.763
I gotta say,
I think you're overreacting.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.765
This is the break
we've been waiting for, Peter.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.018
I'm not gonna be any use to us
until I'm sure she's OK.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.564
What happened to your hand?

12:53.274 --> 12:55.484
The shooting in the boardroom.
I told you.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.112
Destiny's a grown-ass woman.
What are you so worried about?

12:58.279 --> 12:59.196
Everything.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.823
I'm worried
she went to the cops,

13:00.990 --> 13:02.658
and they're keeping her
on ice somewhere,

13:02.825 --> 13:04.160
or Milan got to her,

13:04.326 --> 13:06.036
and now Spivak's going around
lighting up on people.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.080
Who the fuck knows
what happened to her?

13:09.540 --> 13:12.126
She already went
after Milan once.

13:12.293 --> 13:14.837
If he gets a whiff that
I do not have her under control,

13:15.004 --> 13:16.630
she's gonna be fucked.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.800
So if she's planning on taking
another run at this prick...

13:19.967 --> 13:21.469
Yeah. What am I supposed to do?

13:21.635 --> 13:23.345
Ring his doorbell and say,
"Hey, by the way,

13:23.512 --> 13:25.181
"my cousin's gonna try
and murder you again,

13:25.347 --> 13:27.766
"in case you haven't
taken her out already."

13:30.394 --> 13:31.896
I have another approach.

14:05.638 --> 14:07.181
Have as much as you want.

14:07.348 --> 14:09.058
It's crabapple juice.

14:09.225 --> 14:11.310
Supposed to be
an anti-oxidant...

14:12.436 --> 14:14.355
..which, I guess,
is a good thing.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.692
I wasn't snooping.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.821
This palace is for the enjoyment
of all who enter within.

14:27.326 --> 14:28.869
Oh.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.830
I was worried about you.
Where have you been?

14:33.707 --> 14:36.752
I needed a think, a deep one,

14:36.919 --> 14:39.880
which I do best
when I'm by my lonesome

14:40.047 --> 14:44.843
and...when I have
my thinking cube.

14:45.010 --> 14:49.473
That's my re-imagining
of a cultural icon.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.143
Blue, symbolising, uh...

14:54.520 --> 14:55.563
..blue.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.358
What did you need
to think about?

15:00.985 --> 15:02.653
Butterflies.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.239
Butterflies?

15:05.406 --> 15:07.575
Hmm.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.201
The monarch butterfly

15:09.368 --> 15:11.579
congregates in May and
during the warmer months

15:11.745 --> 15:14.498
because of its fondness
for milkweed.

15:14.665 --> 15:18.752
I was thinking about hitting
the road, getting a look-see.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.256
Supposed to be a sight
so beautiful it moved God

15:22.423 --> 15:25.050
to invent the eyeball,
so we could see it.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.303
You're leaving?

15:27.469 --> 15:30.639
I was hoping to change that
to the first-person plural.

15:32.433 --> 15:36.103
The two of us.
Open road. Butterflies.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.856
We could leave tonight.

15:43.027 --> 15:45.362
I sense reluctance.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.454
They treat me bad enough
around here.

15:53.621 --> 15:56.373
Why would it be different
anywhere else?

15:56.540 --> 15:58.500
I'm a big freak.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.545
I believe it was Jimi Hendrix
who urged us

16:01.712 --> 16:04.256
to wave our freak flag high.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.800
You, being taller than most,

16:06.967 --> 16:10.054
are ideally suited
to do just that.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.473
It's time for you
to get out there.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.309
Go some of those places
you've only read about.

16:15.476 --> 16:17.019
I'd be honoured mightily

16:17.186 --> 16:19.063
if you'd have me
as your fellow traveller.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.277
Big decision.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.988
Yeah, as decisions go, probably.

16:31.075 --> 16:33.285
Which will require a think...

16:35.579 --> 16:37.081
..and this.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.094
Olivia.

16:51.095 --> 16:52.721
Olivia?

16:54.139 --> 16:57.017
Congratulations.
The transfer was a success.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.520
Meet the new you.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.068
Oh, my God.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.944
I'm...

17:08.112 --> 17:10.406
- I'm...
- What is it?

17:10.571 --> 17:13.909
Visual discrepancies?
Blurred vision? Haloing?

17:14.076 --> 17:16.244
I'm...I'm a fucking hunk.

17:17.621 --> 17:21.125
I take that you mean
your condition is satisfactory?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.835
Oh.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.045
Better than satisfactory.

17:26.422 --> 17:29.758
I feel...I feel healthy.

17:29.925 --> 17:32.761
Oh, it's been so long,
I'd forgotten what it's like.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.390
And my mind.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.267
Mmm.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.359
I've got my mind back.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.236
Oh, that little bastard
is finally gone.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.321
What little bastard?

17:52.406 --> 17:53.866
Never mind.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.786
Oh.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.172
Wow. This is what
all the fuss is about?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.384
I'm swinging one of these,

18:12.551 --> 18:14.887
now I'm just plain better
than every woman on the planet?

18:16.764 --> 18:18.640
I could get used to this.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.062
Ooh! Mmm. Ooh!

18:24.229 --> 18:25.481
Mmm.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.483
Sheesh.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.359
Doesn't take much
to get it excited.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.237
You'll have the rest of
your unnaturally long life

18:32.404 --> 18:33.697
struggling to avoid
all the trouble

18:33.864 --> 18:35.574
your new friend gets you into.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.327
But right now it's time
to follow through on our deal.

18:38.494 --> 18:40.579
You get rid of your leverage.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.873
Then we get rid of the old you.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.227
Snuffed out in our sleep
after such a valiant struggle.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.103
Sad.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.065
No, but here you are,
ready to carry the torch.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.942
It's not a...death.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.861
It's more like a rebirth.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.572
Still, I'd like
to do something for her.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.700
Send her out on a high note.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.495
And what exactly
did you have in mind?

19:21.662 --> 19:23.956
I need to take the new body
out for a test drive

19:24.122 --> 19:26.041
before you 86 the old one.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.419
God knows she could use a lay.

19:29.586 --> 19:33.215
Your narcissism
truly knows no bounds.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.718
After you've...finished,

19:36.885 --> 19:39.096
I expect you to hold up
your end of the bargain.

19:39.263 --> 19:42.057
Yeah, sure. Fine.
Whatever you want.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.310
Then, by all means, Olivia...

19:46.311 --> 19:48.772
..go fuck yourself.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.157
Olivia.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.123
Are you...

20:06.290 --> 20:08.041
Are we...

20:08.208 --> 20:09.960
Did it work?

20:10.127 --> 20:12.462
Mommy, you have no idea.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.106
Mmm!

20:31.273 --> 20:33.233
Mmm. Mmm.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.985
Ugh!

20:38.363 --> 20:39.948
What? What?

20:42.784 --> 20:45.162
However, comma, previous
experiments have resulted

20:45.329 --> 20:48.832
in spontaneous neural
decompensation, comma,

20:48.999 --> 20:52.127
possibly resulting in death,
which would be...

20:53.795 --> 20:56.632
..highly desirable
and cause for celebration.

20:58.759 --> 21:01.595
Don't listen to him.
It is a blemish. That's all.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.264
I'm not telling you anything
we didn't already know.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.058
I am not horrific!

21:06.224 --> 21:07.684
OK! I overstated the case,

21:07.851 --> 21:10.228
but, dear girl, you and I
both know you're not well.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.939
I warned you
that this would happen.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.691
Did you have a better idea
to keep me alive? No.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.234
Both of you, stop it.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.528
Johann, she is bat-shit crazy.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.156
'Crazy' is not a dispositive
term, medically speaking.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.158
She's arguing
with an imaginary friend.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.744
I'm pretty sure that qualifies
as crazy pretty much everywhere.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.872
I am still here, and you are
gonna treat me with respect,

21:29.039 --> 21:31.416
because without me,
you would not be me!

21:31.583 --> 21:33.460
Everybody pipe down!

21:34.753 --> 21:36.213
Identity dissonance
would not be an issue

21:36.380 --> 21:38.507
if we'd got rid of the old
anatomy, as I'd recommended.

21:38.674 --> 21:40.008
Hmm. You're right.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.844
We need to get rid of this
thing, the sooner, the better.

21:43.011 --> 21:45.138
Oh. First you want to fuck me,

21:45.305 --> 21:47.224
and now you want
to throw me away.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.935
You really are
the perfect male specimen.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.687
Maybe next time
you'll listen to Chango.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.897
There is a reason
I'm revered as a demigod.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.857
Honey, look...

21:57.150 --> 21:58.735
..this is what we wanted.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.237
I mean, I'm healthy

22:00.404 --> 22:03.240
for the first time
in who knows how long.

22:03.407 --> 22:06.827
And I can see,
I can really see

22:06.994 --> 22:09.705
what this disease
has done to us.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.878
Is it really that bad?

22:19.881 --> 22:22.676
Can't you see that we just
want what's best for you?

22:25.512 --> 22:27.431
Do not patronise me.

22:28.432 --> 22:30.267
Olivia, meet Olivia.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.154
Hardnosing the highway?

22:43.613 --> 22:45.866
Aitor's leaving town.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.909
You're going with him,
of course?

22:48.076 --> 22:49.786
I'm thinking about it.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.872
Dumpster-dived this.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.000
Not sure I can fit
everything in it, though.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.044
Always better to pack light.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.672
Not sure I want to go.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.383
Finally have somewhere I belong.

23:03.550 --> 23:04.843
I have friends.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.845
You got to put your tag
in different cities

23:07.012 --> 23:08.388
if you want to be a legend.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.600
- I don't want to be a legend.
- You pretty much already are.

23:11.767 --> 23:13.185
Girl falls down,
next thing you know

23:13.351 --> 23:14.686
she's got 2 million views.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.105
How is that even possible?

23:17.272 --> 23:20.067
Nacho tweeted the link
to Snoop Dogg. Got his co-sign.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.693
Another million hits, who knows?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.779
He'll be rolling up here
wanting to produce your shit.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.697
What shit?

23:25.864 --> 23:27.783
You put this place on the map.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.993
So, why would I want to leave?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.663
You got to take this energy
that you got someplace new

23:33.830 --> 23:35.290
and make your mark there.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.584
And when you do, that place'll
tag you right back.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.252
- You feel me?
- No.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.547
I don't think I'm cut out
for that kind of life.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.883
You owe it to yourself
to find out.

23:49.387 --> 23:52.349
Damn. Still missing something.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.185
Butterflies.

23:57.229 --> 23:58.939
That's real spit.

24:02.984 --> 24:04.986
I have run every test,

24:05.153 --> 24:07.072
checked for cerebral ischemia

24:07.239 --> 24:09.783
by monitoring
microcirculatory blood flow,

24:09.950 --> 24:11.535
NAHD fluorescence.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.912
Do you ever wonder
if he just makes this shit up?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.831
Will you close your yap?
I'll handle him.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.499
You asked me a question.
I answer it.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.126
You tell me to close my yap.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.086
I don't care
what your tests say.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.587
Something's not right with him.

24:22.754 --> 24:25.507
I know firsthand
how disconcerting it can be

24:25.674 --> 24:28.260
to take a cold, hard look
at one's self,

24:28.426 --> 24:30.303
and you, of all people...

24:30.470 --> 24:32.514
It's a living nightmare.
Trust me.

24:32.681 --> 24:35.767
But the fact is,
this was a successful transfer.

24:35.934 --> 24:39.771
You want me to believe
that thing has all my thoughts,

24:39.938 --> 24:42.732
all my memories,
everything that makes me me?

24:42.899 --> 24:44.317
Unfortunately for him, yes.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.444
But, Olivia,
we've been through this.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.406
Oh, she understands
perfectly well how this works.

24:49.573 --> 24:51.741
The old anatomy
is just getting cold feet.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.077
I am not letting you
get rid of me

24:54.244 --> 24:57.205
until I know for sure
that me is the real me.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.875
- You want to test me?
- Sure.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.252
OK.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.588
Take your best shot.

25:04.754 --> 25:06.798
Ask him what our first
leading role was.

25:06.965 --> 25:09.342
What was our first leading role?

25:10.844 --> 25:13.221
- Lady Macbeth.
- Easy.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.765
The real you would know
how you got the role.

25:15.932 --> 25:16.975
That's right.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.894
And how did we get that role?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.520
Fucked the producer
every Sunday

25:20.687 --> 25:22.689
after the matinee
for the run of the show.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.150
And he would weep
every time he orgasmed.

25:25.317 --> 25:28.445
Mm. Detail I'd just as soon
forget.

25:28.612 --> 25:32.032
Oh, Chango must be
throwing a holy shit fit

25:32.199 --> 25:33.533
about this transfer business,

25:33.700 --> 25:35.619
'cause he needs to find
another idiot's imagination

25:35.785 --> 25:37.078
to become a figment of.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.830
Is that proof enough for you?

25:38.997 --> 25:41.625
If she wants to stick around,
who cares?

25:41.791 --> 25:43.793
Just let her suffer
and die a horrible death

25:43.960 --> 25:45.295
while I'm living large

25:45.462 --> 25:47.255
and getting more ass
than a toilet seat.

25:47.422 --> 25:50.508
There! I would never
say something that vile.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.595
You're just jealous
because you know it's true.

25:53.762 --> 25:54.971
I'm hitting my stride,

25:55.138 --> 25:57.390
and you haven't walked
into a room and turned heads

25:57.557 --> 25:59.476
since the Volstead Act
was repealed.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.686
- You conceited bastard!
- Hey, hey! Enough, enough!

26:01.853 --> 26:03.146
Enough, enough, enough.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.940
Nobody is going anywhere,

26:05.106 --> 26:06.399
as long as this
sword of Damocles

26:06.566 --> 26:07.817
is hanging over my head.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.654
Well, I'll make the call for you
and end this little blackmail.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.280
I know everything she knows.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.409
The individual entrusted
with chapter and verse

26:16.576 --> 26:19.412
of his many crimes
against humanity

26:19.579 --> 26:22.165
answers only to Olivia Godfrey.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.793
Mm-hm.
- The real Olivia Godfrey.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.794
Mm.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.963
Olivia, if you want
to stick around

26:28.129 --> 26:30.298
and watch nature run its course,
I can't stop you,

26:30.465 --> 26:34.177
but there's something
I think you'd like to see.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.141
Really, Johann? More rat porn?

26:40.308 --> 26:42.102
What you're about to see
is a test subject

26:42.269 --> 26:45.563
in the advanced stages of
the disease, much like yourself.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.566
And he kills
all of his friends. I know.

26:48.733 --> 26:51.194
Now, this one goes
a step farther.

26:54.281 --> 26:56.074
After rewiring the brain
of the host

26:56.241 --> 26:57.659
to prey upon its own species,

26:57.826 --> 27:00.996
the disease triggers
a complete self-cannibalisation.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.998
All part of Spivak's plan,
no doubt,

27:03.164 --> 27:05.417
to eradicate
the entire upir species.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.923
In a few days,
or maybe a few hours,

27:12.090 --> 27:14.968
this will be you.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.185
This is what I'm trying
to spare you from.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.980
The transfer worked.
Your legacy is secure.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.523
Don't you want to go out

27:28.690 --> 27:30.608
in a manner
of your own choosing?

27:30.775 --> 27:32.902
This is not gonna happen to me.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.362
It can't.

27:34.529 --> 27:39.451
Olivia, have the good sense
to know when you've won.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.230
We're looking for Destiny.

28:11.066 --> 28:12.400
Fuck!

28:17.489 --> 28:21.368
You have no idea the shit rain
you cockroaches walked into.

28:21.534 --> 28:26.081
Your entire bloodlines -
Rumancek, Godfrey -

28:26.247 --> 28:28.500
are about to become extinct.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.378
Yeah, I know who you are.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.881
He thinks he knows who we are.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.967
- Funny, huh?
- Mm.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.442
Are you ready to take us
seriously now?

29:38.653 --> 29:40.488
God, our father,

29:40.655 --> 29:43.199
your power brings us to birth.

29:44.242 --> 29:47.412
Your providence
guides our lives.

29:48.496 --> 29:53.168
And by your command,
we return to dust.

29:56.337 --> 29:57.797
Lord...

29:58.798 --> 30:03.553
..those who die
still live in your presence.

30:05.346 --> 30:09.058
Their lives change,
but do not end.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.814
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.150
That's what the Lord's house
is for.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.903
Is there anything
I can do to help?

30:24.449 --> 30:26.659
You can pray for me, Father.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.799
What...

30:41.966 --> 30:43.968
..what the fuck are you?

30:44.135 --> 30:45.845
You tell us everything
we need to know

30:46.012 --> 30:47.555
and you'll never
have to find out.

30:47.722 --> 30:49.140
I never saw your cousin...

30:49.307 --> 30:52.268
..but I can help you find her.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.938
What? Putting up flyers?

30:55.104 --> 30:57.106
I'll call Luka.

30:58.107 --> 30:59.901
He's the guy I had watching her

31:00.068 --> 31:02.695
ever since she tried
to stick a knife in me.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.909
You keep tabs on your enemies
if you want to survive.

31:08.076 --> 31:11.871
He makes one phone call,
his crew's gonna swarm on us.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.457
I could have took out
your whole fucking organisation

31:14.624 --> 31:16.125
for what Andreas did,

31:16.292 --> 31:19.170
but you convinced me
to listen to reason.

31:19.337 --> 31:21.172
Don't throw that away
on account of something

31:21.339 --> 31:23.258
I had nothing to do with!

31:25.093 --> 31:26.928
He's lying. He's lying.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.597
We don't know that.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.393
I offered to help,
not get myself killed.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.574
If I get the slightest itch
that you're lying...

31:47.740 --> 31:49.951
I'm not.
- ..or you try to bolt...

31:50.118 --> 31:52.620
You're gonna call your guy
and if she doesn't turn up...

31:55.915 --> 31:58.209
So make this call count.

31:58.376 --> 32:00.461
Hey, Peter,
is this Andreas' watch?

32:00.628 --> 32:03.172
You said it was a Panerai.

32:03.339 --> 32:06.342
When I find Destiny, I'm gonna
make sure that she gets this.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.312
I'll set you up
with a slow morphine drip

32:17.478 --> 32:18.896
until you fall asleep,

32:19.063 --> 32:21.274
and then I will gradually
increase the dosage

32:21.441 --> 32:24.027
to make your transition
as peaceful as possible.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.904
That doesn't sound
too unpleasant.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.115
Well, if sudden cardiac arrest
from drug overdose

32:29.282 --> 32:30.742
is your thing.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.412
Everything that I said before...

32:35.413 --> 32:36.873
You know us.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.336
We speak without thinking
how our words affect those

32:41.502 --> 32:43.171
that we care about the most.

32:43.338 --> 32:48.343
But from where I stand,
I see a very brave woman,

32:48.509 --> 32:51.721
and I will do my best
to live up to our legacy.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.348
Lies.

32:53.514 --> 32:56.059
What else is he gonna say?

32:56.225 --> 32:58.186
"Don't let the door hit you
in the ass

32:58.353 --> 32:59.979
"on your way
to eternal nothingness"?

33:00.146 --> 33:02.231
Just try to relax.

33:02.398 --> 33:03.941
You'll be dead soon.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.655
Johann...

33:09.697 --> 33:13.368
..I know we've had
our differences,

33:13.534 --> 33:15.411
but I want you to know...

33:17.372 --> 33:19.999
..you've always been
a worthy adversary.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.378
Pass me the phone.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.673
There's a scientist
I have to rescue

33:26.839 --> 33:29.592
from a certain
sword of Damocles.

33:29.759 --> 33:32.512
Do not do this. With Knox's
money, maybe we can find a cure.

33:32.679 --> 33:35.014
The time for bargaining
has passed,

33:35.181 --> 33:37.975
along with anger and denial.

33:39.143 --> 33:41.312
All that's left now
is acceptance.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.651
Wasn't much to it.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.737
I just left a packet
with a lawyer,

33:49.904 --> 33:52.865
along with instructions
to leak it to the press,

33:53.032 --> 33:55.827
if he didn't hear from me
every other day.

33:58.913 --> 34:01.624
- Skip Osaka. Put me through.
<i>- I'm afraid he's busy.</i>

34:01.791 --> 34:03.418
I don't care if he's busy.

34:03.584 --> 34:06.129
- It's Olivia Godfrey.
<i>- Can you please hold?</i>

34:07.755 --> 34:09.215
I'm on hold.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.342
You're as good
as your word, Olivia.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.302
I'll never forget it.

34:13.469 --> 34:17.348
He says as he jizzes his pants,
because he's free at last.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.475
Do you remember
what Father told us

34:19.641 --> 34:21.601
after the peasant uprising
in Moldova?

34:21.768 --> 34:23.438
He said...he said...

34:23.603 --> 34:25.982
..he said the pie hole
is for unloading.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.109
And unloading... Mac-nam!

34:28.275 --> 34:29.193
Like the Andalusian girls.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.531
Ms Godfrey. Dr Pryce.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.199
The specimen... I was...

34:35.366 --> 34:36.451
Something is...

34:36.617 --> 34:39.411
Something
is wrong here, Johann.

34:39.579 --> 34:42.039
Like the thunder said,
someone else is in here.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.083
Happening to me?

34:45.251 --> 34:47.462
Ugh!

34:47.628 --> 34:50.047
What the fuck
is going on here, Johann?

34:50.214 --> 34:52.425
Olivia...

34:52.592 --> 34:54.177
This was your play all along.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.513
Get me out of the picture,
knowing full well

34:57.680 --> 34:59.432
that gash man over here
would spaz out,

34:59.599 --> 35:01.058
leaving you the cock
of the walk.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.728
I...I knew there'd be risks.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.938
There are always risks,
but the odds...

35:06.105 --> 35:07.982
Kill, kill, kill!

35:08.149 --> 35:09.692
I thought you two being upirs,

35:09.859 --> 35:11.819
the genetic material
would be more than a match...

35:11.986 --> 35:14.280
Remember this?

35:14.447 --> 35:15.907
I'm gonna finish the job
this time.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.242
You kill me,
there'll be no-one to keep you

35:18.409 --> 35:20.703
from devouring yourself,
like that rat.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.500
Gagging on your own intestines.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.919
- Chewing on your own shit.
- Ew.

35:29.504 --> 35:32.507
You said something about this
match not being close enough.

35:32.673 --> 35:34.967
Anything that
significantly diverges

35:35.134 --> 35:38.554
from your genomic synthesis
will end up exactly like that.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.515
It's just a matter of time.

35:40.681 --> 35:44.310
You have to admit,
it was a good plan.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.147
When we're on the same side,
we're unstoppable,

35:48.314 --> 35:49.857
so finding a candidate

35:50.024 --> 35:52.777
closer to
my genomic synthesis,

35:52.944 --> 35:55.112
are we talking family members?

35:57.073 --> 36:00.827
Well, I would have to analyse
the nucleotide sequencing.

36:02.495 --> 36:04.539
Get to work,
and don't fuck this up.

36:04.705 --> 36:06.833
What about him?

36:12.171 --> 36:13.714
Waste not, want not.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.551
Well, then.

36:16.717 --> 36:18.344
I'll leave you to it.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.690
Alright, enough.
We need him alive.

36:30.857 --> 36:33.067
Enough.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.444
Ugh!

36:37.446 --> 36:39.156
Destiny was here.

36:39.323 --> 36:40.992
Where is she now?

36:41.158 --> 36:42.910
I never saw her.

36:43.077 --> 36:44.579
Then why did you have her ring?

36:44.745 --> 36:46.914
This has been in our family
for generations.

36:47.081 --> 36:50.543
What would I want
with a stone that small? Hmm?

36:50.710 --> 36:52.753
I couldn't fence it
if I wanted to.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.547
A trophy, like Andreas' watch.

36:54.714 --> 36:58.175
Maybe somebody
doesn't want us truce-ing.

36:58.342 --> 37:01.804
They're framing me.
Pitting us against each other.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.514
And who'd want to do that?

37:03.681 --> 37:06.767
Fucking rivals. The Italians.

37:06.934 --> 37:09.312
- Chinatown boys. The Mexicans.
- Oh, sure.

37:09.478 --> 37:11.230
Yeah, blame it on the Mexicans.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.065
You?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.484
You were over looking at my
stuff when that ring appeared.

37:15.651 --> 37:17.862
- What are you trying to say?
- Fuck this! Fuck!

37:29.457 --> 37:31.125
He could be telling the truth.

37:32.126 --> 37:34.712
I mean, if he's being set up,
she could still be alive.

37:35.713 --> 37:37.757
He was having her followed.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.593
Your grandmother's ring
was in his dressing room.

37:40.760 --> 37:42.720
We got to face the facts here.

37:44.180 --> 37:46.223
Destiny's not coming back.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.059
We don't know that.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.560
I mean, she could have...

37:49.727 --> 37:51.395
She could have... She could...

37:53.981 --> 37:55.483
She could...

37:57.026 --> 37:58.486
Oh.

38:04.951 --> 38:07.620
I'll find out
what he did with her.

38:13.501 --> 38:15.670
No more. No more!

38:15.836 --> 38:19.423
I can't! I can't.

38:20.758 --> 38:24.220
We know what you did. You don't
want to cop to it? That's fine.

38:24.387 --> 38:25.680
I'm finishing it right now.

38:25.846 --> 38:28.099
Let's see what
your errand boy Luka knows.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.434
No-one followed her.

38:30.601 --> 38:33.729
You say you always
keep tabs on your enemies.

38:35.731 --> 38:36.816
Huh?

38:36.983 --> 38:39.652
Either you were lying then,
or you're lying now.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.320
Which one is it?

38:50.079 --> 38:52.540
I read somewhere
that a broken femur

38:52.707 --> 38:56.502
is the most painful injury
the human body can experience.

38:59.005 --> 39:01.382
It was a fucking...
it was a fucking trap.

39:01.549 --> 39:03.300
Yeah?

39:03.467 --> 39:06.470
I didn't do anything
to that chick.

39:07.805 --> 39:11.308
You know how many enemies
I have, hmm?

39:11.475 --> 39:13.519
Destiny, she never even rated.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.824
Fuck!

39:35.332 --> 39:36.917
Where is she?

39:37.918 --> 39:41.380
Jesus. Fuck.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.594
Fuck. OK!

39:47.595 --> 39:49.305
I'll tell you.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.976
She...she came...

39:54.143 --> 39:55.770
..she came looking for revenge

39:55.936 --> 39:59.648
for what we did to her man,
just like you said,

39:59.815 --> 40:03.652
and I put her on a plane
out of the country.

40:05.154 --> 40:07.990
Just like we did with that whore
who was fucking Andreas.

40:10.117 --> 40:15.122
She...she knew that it was
catch a flight or a bullet.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.253
I didn't do anything to her.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.215
I swear.

40:27.468 --> 40:28.969
You're lying.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.823
Uncle Johann.

41:30.990 --> 41:35.619
Shelley, you have become
such a celebrity.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.789
Well, what are you doing here?

41:38.956 --> 41:40.499
I'm afraid
it's not a social call.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.793
It's...about your mother.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.463
Is she OK?
Roman told me she's sick.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.257
She is not at all well.

41:48.424 --> 41:51.093
If you see her coming, I need
you to call me immediately,

41:51.260 --> 41:54.763
and promise to get as far away
as you can, no matter what.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.765
Oh, my God.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.767
Is she gonna be OK?

41:58.934 --> 42:01.395
She's receiving state-of-the-art
medical attention,

42:01.562 --> 42:04.064
which I'm overseeing personally.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.776
Then she's in good hands.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.445
The best.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.325
Can you keep a secret?

42:19.455 --> 42:22.791
I'm leaving Hemlock Grove
tonight.

42:22.958 --> 42:27.630
This time tomorrow, I'll be
up in Maine chasing butterflies.

42:27.796 --> 42:32.259
I don't think it's safe for you
to be travelling all alone.

42:33.469 --> 42:35.137
Can you keep another secret?

42:35.304 --> 42:37.973
Sometimes I fear
that's all I'm good at.

42:39.016 --> 42:41.393
I have a boyfriend.

42:44.230 --> 42:46.190
Now that you're here,
I'll introduce you.

42:46.357 --> 42:48.943
I already know you'll get along.
Aitor gets along with everybody.

42:49.109 --> 42:51.695
You are truly full of surprises.

42:51.862 --> 42:55.491
I am...so happy for you,
Shelley.

42:55.658 --> 42:57.159
Truly happy.

42:58.494 --> 43:00.162
Can I share a secret of my own?

43:00.329 --> 43:01.997
Do tell.

43:02.164 --> 43:05.584
I've been
seeing someone myself.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.503
What's he like?

43:15.344 --> 43:16.929
It feels...

43:20.933 --> 43:23.018
I don't know how to describe it.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.897
Like you can be your ideal self

43:27.064 --> 43:31.443
because that's what he sees
when he looks at you.

43:32.945 --> 43:34.989
What am I going to do
without you?

43:35.155 --> 43:36.907
Write...

43:38.534 --> 43:40.160
..every day.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.584
Well...

43:49.211 --> 43:52.548
Well, where is
your special someone?

43:52.715 --> 43:56.010
I can't wait to meet him.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.691
I almost believed him.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.072
He was a good liar,
but he got what he deserved.

44:18.407 --> 44:21.243
Still, Destiny's dead
because of me.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.044
Edge Cliff Woods.

44:31.045 --> 44:33.630
Told me his guys
were gonna bury us there.

45:07.831 --> 45:09.958
I swear
I didn't make him up.

45:10.125 --> 45:12.002
No, I don't think Aitor Quantic

45:12.169 --> 45:14.463
is something anybody
could make up.

45:17.257 --> 45:18.759
There he is.

45:20.302 --> 45:23.639
- Story time.
- You're gonna love this.

45:23.806 --> 45:28.602
This is a story about a man
and three wishes.

45:30.479 --> 45:34.858
There's no genie,
but there is a bottle,

45:35.025 --> 45:37.778
because our man
was a drinking man.

45:37.945 --> 45:40.572
Yeah.

45:40.739 --> 45:42.241
And one night, he found himself

45:42.408 --> 45:46.328
face to face
with one of his darkest fears.

45:46.495 --> 45:48.789
This particular bottle

45:48.956 --> 45:52.793
that had given him so much joy
and pleasure was empty.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.713
In fact, there wasn't
a drop left in the whole house.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.508
And no money to buy more.

46:00.509 --> 46:02.845
That's when he made
his first wish.

46:03.846 --> 46:08.600
He summoned all the powers
from realms seen and unseen

46:08.767 --> 46:10.602
and wished for another bottle.

46:10.769 --> 46:12.521
Yeah.

46:12.688 --> 46:14.690
- Alright.
- Yeah.

46:14.857 --> 46:17.985
And when he opened his eyes,
he saw all the empty bottles

46:18.152 --> 46:22.614
lying around and realised
his wish had been granted.

46:22.781 --> 46:26.326
He could take 'em to the store,
collect the deposit money,

46:26.493 --> 46:28.787
and buy more booze.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.543
So he jumped in his truck.

46:34.710 --> 46:36.837
He hauled ass out of there,

46:37.004 --> 46:39.840
but he didn't check
the rear-view as he backed up.

46:40.007 --> 46:43.844
So he didn't see what made
the loud and terrible thunk

46:44.011 --> 46:46.680
he heard
when the truck rolled over it.

46:52.352 --> 46:54.396
Made his second wish.

46:55.939 --> 46:59.234
Summoned those powers,
from realms seen and unseen.

46:59.401 --> 47:04.448
"Please, please, please, don't
let it be the neighbour's dog."

47:06.200 --> 47:08.494
And lo and behold,
his wish was granted.

47:09.786 --> 47:11.747
It wasn't the neighbour's dog.

47:11.914 --> 47:15.626
It was an old man,
just walking by.

47:21.381 --> 47:24.551
The cause of death, tyre tracks
on or about the head.

47:31.183 --> 47:35.771
I went to jail
for vehicular homicide.

47:36.855 --> 47:40.234
I did my time,
but when I was released,

47:40.400 --> 47:43.028
I thought I knew more
than the authorities,

47:43.195 --> 47:45.280
so I skipped out on parole.

47:45.447 --> 47:47.991
I was still suffering
from that disease of self

47:48.158 --> 47:50.369
that got me drinking
in the first place.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.997
I've been a fugitive ever since.

47:56.833 --> 47:59.545
Now, this former drinking man,

47:59.711 --> 48:01.296
this me...

48:02.798 --> 48:04.508
..made a third wish.

48:06.677 --> 48:11.098
I wished for something so rare,
so impossible,

48:11.265 --> 48:13.976
the odds of me finding it
were due south of none...

48:14.977 --> 48:18.564
..all the powers from realms
seen and unseen notwithstanding.

48:21.817 --> 48:23.527
I wished for a soul mate.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.407
And a woman so rare,

48:28.574 --> 48:32.953
so beautiful and unique
came unto me...

48:34.121 --> 48:37.291
..causing me to say,
"What's up?"

48:41.628 --> 48:45.173
I, uh...asked her
to come away with me.

48:46.174 --> 48:48.093
To run away
would be more accurate,

48:48.260 --> 48:49.845
'cause I can't stay here.

48:50.012 --> 48:52.556
I'm afraid of being caught
for what I did.

48:52.723 --> 48:56.310
That's my disease of self
rearing its ugly head

48:56.476 --> 48:59.771
because...because what I
was really asking her to do

48:59.938 --> 49:02.399
was hide herself from the world.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.360
She's already
done enough hiding.

49:05.527 --> 49:07.321
It wouldn't be fair.

49:08.322 --> 49:10.282
I wish things
could be different...

49:12.743 --> 49:14.536
..but I'm all out of wishes.

49:24.963 --> 49:29.468
So, with this siren song
as my swan song...

49:30.886 --> 49:32.596
..I bid you all adieu.

49:38.143 --> 49:39.436
We should get out of here.

49:39.603 --> 49:42.397
Don't go! I love you.

49:43.607 --> 49:45.233
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

49:45.400 --> 49:48.779
<i>Please, do not run!
I repeat, do not run!</i>

50:42.791 --> 50:44.292
What? It's late.

50:44.459 --> 50:46.962
- Uh, Roman Godfrey?
- Who is this?

50:47.129 --> 50:49.631
Yeah, hi.
This is Detective Israel.

50:49.798 --> 50:51.133
I'm hoping you can help me

50:51.299 --> 50:53.343
with an ongoing
homicide investigation.

50:53.510 --> 50:54.886
I'm following up on a lead

50:55.053 --> 50:57.431
regarding the murder
of Merrill Samis and his family.

50:57.597 --> 51:01.435
They were found frozen to death
in South Erie last week.

51:01.601 --> 51:03.061
I don't even know who that is.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.897
If this is some kind of a
prank call, I'm not in the mood.

51:06.064 --> 51:07.315
"Helmet smorgasbord."

51:07.482 --> 51:09.151
Does that mean anything to you?

51:11.319 --> 51:14.990
Mr Samis texted that
to your phone the day he died.

51:15.157 --> 51:17.033
Where'd you say
you were calling from?

51:17.200 --> 51:19.494
South Erie.

51:31.798 --> 51:33.508
Blinsky!

51:33.675 --> 51:35.218
I wasn't sleeping.

51:35.385 --> 51:36.762
You weren't answering
your phone, either.

51:36.928 --> 51:38.638
Erie. Erie, Pennsylvania.

51:38.805 --> 51:40.474
That's where we need
to be looking.

51:42.184 --> 51:44.227
Put it in the fucking computer!

51:44.394 --> 51:47.189
Even with a zipcode
this would take a while.

52:00.911 --> 52:04.289
We got him. We fucking got him!

53:04.307 --> 53:05.976
I'm looking for some protection.

53:06.977 --> 53:08.562
Oh, we're fresh out of condoms.

53:08.728 --> 53:10.730
Try holding an aspirin
between your knees.

53:10.897 --> 53:13.900
I live alone, and there
have been some break-ins

53:14.067 --> 53:15.569
in my neighbourhood.

53:17.028 --> 53:18.989
Say no more.

53:19.155 --> 53:20.490
Just so happens we're having

53:20.657 --> 53:22.742
a 'World's Gone to Shit' special
this week.

53:22.909 --> 53:26.746
For the ladies,
the Taurus.45/.41.

53:26.913 --> 53:28.832
Great conceal and carry.

53:28.999 --> 53:31.835
The Smith & Wesson M&P22.

53:32.961 --> 53:36.464
And the Sig Sauer P226.

53:36.631 --> 53:38.717
All available
in breast-cancer pink.

53:38.884 --> 53:40.552
Mm.

53:40.719 --> 53:43.889
I was thinking more along
the lines of a Desert Eagle.

53:44.055 --> 53:46.558
Recoil on a weapon
like that'll land you

53:46.725 --> 53:49.102
on your pretty little bubble
butt back in last Tuesday.

53:50.353 --> 53:53.481
You guys didn't think
my pretty little bubble butt

53:53.648 --> 53:56.818
was so helpless
when we were dropped in the LZ,

53:56.985 --> 54:00.614
to patch up Chosen Company,
2nd Battalion,

54:00.780 --> 54:02.532
after the Battle of Wanat.

54:02.699 --> 54:07.495
"God's own angels,"
I think the GIs called us.

54:09.205 --> 54:10.999
Sorry about the jokes.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.751
It's alright.

54:12.918 --> 54:14.920
Nothing I haven't heard before.

54:23.803 --> 54:25.347
Need some hollow points.

54:25.513 --> 54:29.017
125 grain. Jacketed.

54:29.184 --> 54:32.854
Jesus. What kind of burglars
are we talking about here?

54:33.021 --> 54:37.400
The kind you drop fast,
and they don't get up.
