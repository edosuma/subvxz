WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.536
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
We're back!

00:02.570 --> 00:04.772
And fate had brought Jane back
to her very first love, Adam.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.774
And she leapt right into
a relationship with him.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.743
(cries out)

00:09.777 --> 00:11.579
I know! Ouch.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.615
But still, it's nice
to see her happy, isn't it?

00:14.648 --> 00:17.085
Less happy, our Rafael.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.652
See, he'd lost all his money.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.222
And his sister Luisa
kicked him out of the Marbella.

00:21.255 --> 00:24.225
So he was scheming with Petra
to buy Luisa out.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.760
Oh, and did I mention,
Petra recently dumped him.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.363
I'm sorry, Rafael.
Just go.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.332
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, so like I said,

00:31.365 --> 00:33.067
Raf was in a bad place.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.236
But at least he found
an investor to work with.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.106
Only problem:
he had to work her.

00:38.139 --> 00:41.609
And speaking of dark times,
remember Petra's mother Magda?

00:41.642 --> 00:44.378
You know, the one who was
locked up in jail for murder.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.115
Well...
Granny's back.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.282
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.783
And she teamed up with Luisa,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.685
who was also trying
to sell the damn hotel,

00:51.719 --> 00:52.753
because she needed the money

00:52.786 --> 00:54.422
to spring her crime lord
girlfriend from jail.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.656
I know!

00:55.689 --> 00:57.258
Straight out of a telenovela,
right?

00:57.291 --> 00:59.260
Well, imagine this.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.695
Jane's father
recently married her mother,

01:01.729 --> 01:04.532
even though he was expecting
a baby with his ex, Darci,

01:04.565 --> 01:07.235
who he had a complicated
relationship with.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.637
But at least
he was still a big star.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.805
Although right now,
he's playing someone very tiny.

01:11.839 --> 01:15.309
Oh, and he recently got
a familiar new costar.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.611
That's right,
Esteban's back, too.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.380
And he'd hit it off with Darci.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.183
And things are due to drop,
so let's dive in.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.655
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was seven years old,

01:27.688 --> 01:29.423
she met one of
her mom's boyfriends

01:29.457 --> 01:31.325
for the first time.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.394
Unfortunately...

01:33.427 --> 01:35.163
(screams)

01:35.196 --> 01:36.764
Jane, are you okay?

01:36.797 --> 01:39.333
...Jane didn't know
it was her mother's boyfriend.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.436
Needless to say,
Jane wanted it to go perfectly

01:42.470 --> 01:44.705
when Mateo and Adam
met for the first time.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.240
And after grilled
cheese sandwiches,

01:46.274 --> 01:48.442
you'll give him a big
bag of gummy worms,

01:48.476 --> 01:50.611
and I'm gonna be like,
"No more candy, young man."

01:50.644 --> 01:53.147
And then you're gonna
be like, "Come on."

01:53.181 --> 01:54.515
And then I'm gonna
be like, "Okay."

01:54.548 --> 01:56.250
And then we'll go
to a baseball game.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.552
Got it.
When is this happening?

01:58.586 --> 01:59.620
In eight weeks.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.422
IKE: Eight weeks?
Wow, that's like

02:01.455 --> 02:02.790
two years
in Jane/Adam time.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.858
Your relationship
is in, like, a...

02:04.892 --> 02:06.394
time warp.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.861
Dude, yes, yes!

02:07.895 --> 02:09.197
They time warped

02:09.230 --> 02:10.798
right over Adam's
panic zone.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.366
(both laugh)

02:13.601 --> 02:14.835
Don't you two
have to get dressed

02:14.868 --> 02:16.204
if you're gonna make that movie?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.207
(sighs)

02:19.240 --> 02:20.408
Sorry about that.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.176
No, it's okay.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.745
I mean, I understand
if you're in panic zone.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.547
We are moving pretty fast.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
I'm not in the panic zone.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.751
I am in "I want to spend
every second with you" zone.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.953
*

02:32.986 --> 02:35.489
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
This goes on for a while.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.592
Let's time warp through it.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.294
Peace out, bro.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.430
Bye.
I should get home, too,
get back to Mateo.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.964
Hey, do you want to
come over tomorrow

02:43.997 --> 02:45.866
after he goes to school?

02:45.899 --> 02:46.700
Yeah, roger that.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.502
I will engage
the Mateo Protocol.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.304
Copy, copy, 10-4, copy.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.905
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, the Mateo Protocol.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.241
That is the...

02:53.274 --> 02:56.444
Actually, let's just time warp
to tomorrow morning to see it.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.446
This trick is useful, isn't it?

02:58.479 --> 03:00.714
Bye, Mommy.
Bye.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.516
(door closes)

03:02.550 --> 03:03.851
*

03:11.825 --> 03:12.826
(bell rings)

03:14.728 --> 03:17.231
(rhythmic knocking on door)

03:19.967 --> 03:22.370
(rhythmic knocking on door)

03:23.871 --> 03:24.872
(timer dings)

03:24.905 --> 03:26.540
(giggles)

03:26.574 --> 03:27.808
Okay, I think we can
shorten the knock sequence.

03:27.841 --> 03:28.776
No way.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.778
The complexity is what
makes it so badass.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.462
(cat meows)
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
I think our agent
has been compromised.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.732
(phone chimes)

03:51.765 --> 03:53.267
(laughs)

03:54.735 --> 03:56.337
(gasps)

03:56.370 --> 03:58.472
My publisher sent over
the art for my book cover.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.374
No way.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.344
What?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.645
If you saw this
on the shelf,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.680
what would you think
this book is about?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.650
Hmm.

04:09.683 --> 04:13.754
Is it, uh, a period piece
about a woman who can't wait

04:13.787 --> 04:15.689
to give her boyfriend
the business?

04:15.723 --> 04:16.857
(chuckles)
Exactly.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.592
And no, it's not.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.494
I just don't understand.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.830
Where's the romance?
There's no magic.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.532
It's all about sex.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.468
And my book is about so much
more than that, you know?

04:27.501 --> 04:28.836
Actually, I don't.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.071
It's kind of hard to
judge the book by the cover

04:31.104 --> 04:32.440
if I haven't read it.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.076
That's my way of asking you
if I can read it.
Mm.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.746
Or, are we not at that point
in our timeline?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.714
Usually, that's like
a five month thing,

04:40.748 --> 04:42.816
but since you already
taught me roofball...

04:42.850 --> 04:44.685
I'm going to say okay.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.421
And I'll just casually
wait really anxiously

04:47.455 --> 04:49.857
until you read it,
so be timely, please.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.459
Right on.
Mmm.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.626
I'm so stoked.
Mmm.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.696
And I will just give my
publisher notes on the cover.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.798
Less sex.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.868
That's for them,
not for us, right?

05:00.901 --> 05:03.070
Oh.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.638
(giggles)

05:04.672 --> 05:06.940
KATHERINE:
This is not pillow talky.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.643
This is work talky.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.545
I just want to
know the details.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.681
So, you and your partner
are doing an inspection

05:13.714 --> 05:15.048
of the Marbella
tomorrow?

05:15.082 --> 05:17.017
Well, I got to look
under the hood

05:17.050 --> 05:19.553
and make sure everything
I'm buying is good and fresh.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.356
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, hello, Raf the boy toy.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.526
You know, I could talk
to your investor as well,

05:25.559 --> 05:27.495
if it would make them
feel more comfortable.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.398
Don't you worry about it.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.099
We're all on the same page.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.368
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I wish
someone would explain it to me.

05:34.402 --> 05:38.539
We're gonna buy the Marbella,
hire you as CEO to run it,

05:38.572 --> 05:41.509
and set up a payment plan
for you to buy it back over time

05:41.542 --> 05:43.444
plus interest, plus ten percent
for me for the front.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.513
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That makes sense.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.680
And...

05:46.714 --> 05:47.815
And...

05:47.848 --> 05:49.683
your sister will
never know about us.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.919
Mmm.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.588
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Looks like Jane's not
the only secret agent.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.689
Don't worry.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.725
(phone vibrates)

06:12.072 --> 06:15.409
Everything okay?
Just a kid thing.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.286
PETRA:
What are you wearing?

06:26.319 --> 06:29.890
Babicka gave us presents when
we saw her in the kids' club.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.494
Why are you so mean
to Babicka?

06:33.527 --> 06:35.596
Girls.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.166
Your grandmother and I
have a complicated relationship

06:39.199 --> 06:43.637
'cause she's done some
not-very-nice things.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.905
Magda!

06:51.712 --> 06:54.948
Our teachers at school say
we should always forgive.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.950
Well, they haven't met
your Babicka.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.722
(laughs):
Kidding. I'm kidding.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.491
No, you girls are right.

07:03.524 --> 07:07.695
I'll just have a chat
with Granny tomorrow,

07:07.728 --> 07:10.598
and we'll just work
all of our issues out.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.100
You stay away from my kids,
do you hear me?!

07:13.133 --> 07:15.469
You want me gone?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.505
Then sign the deal
from Luisa.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.172
(scoffs)
Never.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.775
I built this hotel.
I'm not selling it.

07:21.809 --> 07:26.113
Then Babicka will be talking
to darling girls in hallway,

07:26.146 --> 07:28.048
in lounge,

07:28.081 --> 07:29.850
maybe even teach them
how to pickpocket.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.118
Okay, how about this.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.753
Whatever Luisa's paying,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.755
I'll pay you more
to leave town.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.190
She's paying us
a million dollars.

07:37.224 --> 07:41.128
Actually, it's a million
Czech korunas, Mother.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.063
Korunas?!

07:43.096 --> 07:45.032
That's only $46,000.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.034
Wow, wow, wow!

07:47.067 --> 07:50.070
Looks like you bet
on the wrong horse.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.640
ESTEBAN:
Ride me, Darci!

07:52.673 --> 07:53.807
Ride me!

07:53.841 --> 07:55.142
This is too much.
DARCI: Yes!

07:55.175 --> 07:56.777
I can't tolerate having to hear

07:56.810 --> 07:59.813
Esteban have sex
with my unborn child.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.082
He's having sex with your
unborn child's mother.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.551
Who goes after a pregnant woman

08:03.584 --> 08:05.586
and starts dating her
within a week?

08:05.619 --> 08:08.088
Is it some kind of fetish
or something?

08:08.121 --> 08:10.257
ESTEBAN:
Yes, Momma!

08:11.859 --> 08:14.562
They are both just doing this
to get to me.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.163
DARCI:
Oh, yes!

08:16.196 --> 08:17.965
Yes!
I'm telling you,

08:17.998 --> 08:19.132
she's faking it.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.834
I mean, I should know.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.302
Okay, enough.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.905
You need to chill.
This isn't about you.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.306
They have some kind of
chemical attraction

08:26.339 --> 08:29.142
that I'm sure is going to
flame out eventually.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.111
(knocks)
New script pages.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.180
Gracias, Rudy.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.316
*

08:36.349 --> 08:38.185
(gags)

08:38.218 --> 08:40.721
Who okayed
this disgusting rewrite?!

08:40.754 --> 08:41.955
ESTEBAN:
I did.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.158
On Five-O the writers
were always taking my ideas.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.860
Well, this is not Hawaii Five-O.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.629
This is a telenovela,

08:48.662 --> 08:51.131
and your character cannot
have sex with the lady scientist

08:51.164 --> 08:54.602
when I'm still shrunken
and living inside her.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.803
Why not?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.304
Because you can't just

08:57.337 --> 08:58.872
introduce a new love interest

08:58.906 --> 09:00.641
three-fifths of the way
through the series

09:00.674 --> 09:03.110
and expect the audience
to root for him!

09:03.143 --> 09:05.278
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey,
that reminds me, where's Adam?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.080
*

09:07.114 --> 09:08.281
What a great guy.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.983
It doesn't make logical sense.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.052
And audiences need logic.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.088
This is not the intestine
I approved!

09:17.390 --> 09:21.795
I am rejecting this rewrite.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.264
Period, period, period.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.801
Technically that's,
that's an ellipsis.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.202
Fine.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.639
Obviously, Rogelio wants
the show to suck.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.707
JANE:
No, it-it's really good.

09:33.741 --> 09:37.210
But I do have some thoughts.
Uh, oh.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.279
Go get dressed; Bisa's gonna
take you to the park.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.950
A snow globe is
sort of the central metaphor,

09:42.983 --> 09:44.852
so it would be, you know,
it would be nice

09:44.885 --> 09:46.253
to work that in.
And it's a...

09:46.286 --> 09:48.622
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah,
let's time warp through this.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.290
I think that about sums it up.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.392
Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.961
That was a really
great call.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.863
I think they totally heard me.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.101
Mwah. Have fun, you two.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.404
Bye.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.874
(door closes)

10:06.907 --> 10:08.909
*

10:14.948 --> 10:17.017
(grumbles):
Come on.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.653
(rhythmic knocking on door)

10:20.453 --> 10:22.322
Nah.
(timer dings)

10:22.355 --> 10:24.091
You-you cut the knock
sequence short?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.225
We'll live.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.960
Mmm.
Mmm.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.996
So...

10:29.029 --> 10:30.363
good news.

10:30.397 --> 10:33.100
The publisher was really
receptive to the notes

10:33.133 --> 10:34.868
that I gave on my cover.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.369
(squeals, laughs)
Whoa.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.672
So we should celebrate.
Oh, yeah?

10:38.706 --> 10:41.775
Yeah, I got a few ideas.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.144
(door opens)

10:44.177 --> 10:45.913
I forgot Mr. Monkey.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.047
Don't hurt my mommy!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.015
Oh...
Hyah!
Ow!

10:49.016 --> 10:50.751
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey, could be worse.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.352
At least nobody had a knife.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.191
Were you giving my mommy
a special hug?!
What?

10:58.225 --> 11:01.328
To give her a baby.
What?! No!

11:01.361 --> 11:02.930
No, that's not what it was.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.064
So what was it?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.034
More like a special kiss

11:07.067 --> 11:08.769
that's not about babies.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.070
What's a special kiss about?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.841
JANE:
Um...

11:13.874 --> 11:16.810
well, it's, um, uh...

11:16.844 --> 11:21.815
it's a... regular kiss,
um, but longer.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.483
I want a special kiss.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.118
Oh, Mateo, no.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.121
Mwah. Mwah.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.122
Love you, Daddy.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.358
I love you guys.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.692
Off you go.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.964
I'll see you soon.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.767
Wait. Can we talk?

11:40.968 --> 11:42.135
What's there to say?

11:42.169 --> 11:45.505
Well, I just want you to know

11:45.538 --> 11:47.374
that I've got
my mother handled.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.243
Turns out she and Anezka are too
inept to be much of a threat.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.945
So, anyway,

11:51.979 --> 11:55.215
if Katherine Cortes doesn't
come through, we're fine.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.750
We can wait
for another investor.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.251
The Katherine deal
will go through.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.753
How do you know?

11:59.787 --> 12:02.122
She told me in bed.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.759
I... I thought
you weren't going there.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.961
Hey, my personal life's
not your concern.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.262
Remember?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.803
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of
an uncomfortable personal life.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.871
I'll do the belly
jelly, honey bun.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.506
I'd love to.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.843
Geez, is there anything
the man can't make porny?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.377
Why is he even here?

12:24.411 --> 12:27.247
Bringing your man to a sonogram
after just one week of dating

12:27.280 --> 12:30.350
must violate every rule
in the Darci Factor rule book.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.121
Rule number 97,
Codicil L for love.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.257
"When your heart's been took,
throw out the book."

12:37.290 --> 12:40.460
Geez, these two make
Adam and Jane

12:40.493 --> 12:42.195
seem like
they're taking it slow.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.265
Okay. There she is!

12:46.834 --> 12:48.802
(gasps softly)

12:48.836 --> 12:51.338
I can't wait to meet her.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.339
Neither can I.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.574
(Esteban sobs)

12:54.607 --> 12:58.578
I've never wanted
to meet someone so badly,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.413
but at the same time,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.851
I feel like I
already know her.

13:03.884 --> 13:08.889
Baby...
that's so profound.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.062
(whimpering)

13:18.298 --> 13:20.167
RAFAEL:
Okay, baby.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.871
Call me as soon as the hotel
inspection's done, all right?

13:23.904 --> 13:26.006
I'll see you later. Kisses.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.441
"Kisses"? Already?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.277
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
"Kisses"? Ever?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.146
So... give me
some details.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.449
Oh, come on, we used to talk
about this stuff all the time.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.886
She's fun.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.087
Mm-hmm.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.289
And we're keeping it casual.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.892
(clears throat)
Unlike you and Adam.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.627
Right.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.198
So, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.067
Um, Mateo met Adam.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.502
It was an accident.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.971
But it wasn't good.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.339
Here's what happened.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.908
You don't need
to hear this again.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.442
Let's just see how he takes it.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.244
From everything
that Alba's told me,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.113
I don't think the guy's
a good influence.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.547
Yup. Not well.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.282
She hates him from years ago.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.583
You went skinny-dipping
on your first date

14:10.617 --> 14:12.119
and broke your leg
on your second.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.054
It was actually
the sixth date.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.324
Point being, the guy doesn't
just scream "responsible" to me.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.259
You can't say that
without meeting him.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.161
Let's all have a meal,
so that you can see

14:21.194 --> 14:22.996
that he's not an imminent danger
to our son.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.465
Fine.
Great! I'll tell Adam.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.001
ROGELIO: I have an amazing
announcement to make!

14:28.035 --> 14:30.170
Our beautiful new daughter

14:30.203 --> 14:32.205
will make
her world premiere

14:32.239 --> 14:37.444
at the Ricky Martin Celebrity
Birthing Suite at Miami General.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.948
I pulled some of
the many, many strings

14:40.981 --> 14:44.451
available to me for our baby
to enter this world

14:44.484 --> 14:49.689
in this luxurious
and 100% sterile environment.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.958
Do you want
to tell him?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.559
Let's do it together.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.027
Rogelio, we're...
We are...

14:54.061 --> 14:55.295
No, you should start.
You go... No.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.296
(laughs)

14:56.329 --> 14:57.330
We always do this.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.166
Okay, on the count of three.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.201
One, two, three.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.370
BOTH:
We're having a home birth!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.405
A what?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.639
DARCI:
A natural delivery

15:06.673 --> 15:08.075
at home.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.243
With a birthing pool
and a doula.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.013
Esteban mentioned it, I
researched it, and I decided

15:13.046 --> 15:15.348
it's the best option
for baby and me.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.051
While I was shooting Five-O,
I spent a lot of time

15:18.085 --> 15:21.021
with the locals and got in
touch with my earthy side.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.091
And by locals, I mean Alex
O'Loughlin and Scotty Caan.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.059
They raved about
home birth!

15:26.093 --> 15:28.495
DARCI:
Mmm, that's exactly

15:28.528 --> 15:30.497
what I want, Smush.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.599
Oh, I'm so happy, Mush.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.268
JANE:
Ew.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.470
This cover art is even worse.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.707
What would you think this
book's about if you saw it?

15:40.740 --> 15:41.708
SONIA:
Ooh.

15:41.741 --> 15:45.078
Um... an old-timey

15:45.112 --> 15:46.346
sex magician?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.481
(sighs) I'm just gonna
give them more notes.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.683
They made me do 26 drafts
of this novel;

15:50.717 --> 15:52.452
they can take another pass
at the cover.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.387
True.
WAITER: Jane.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.090
I've got a nightmare customer
demanding to see the manager.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.326
(sighs)

15:59.359 --> 16:00.727
JANE:
How can I help you?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.530
This salad. It's disgusting.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.632
The lettuce is wilted
and the chicken is not warm,

16:05.665 --> 16:07.234
which the menu indicated
it would be.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.501
JANE:
I'm so sorry.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.103
Taste it.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.271
It's okay,
I believe you.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.639
You won't even
eat the food

16:12.672 --> 16:14.107
that you served me?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.375
Taste it.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.282
Mm. You're right.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.350
Let me get you a menu

16:23.383 --> 16:25.452
so you can pick something
else out, on the house.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.790
What... a bitch.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.858
Oh, you mean Rafael's hook-up?

16:31.891 --> 16:34.561
No, I mean the garbage
human in the white dress.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.531
Yeah.
That's Katherine Cortes.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.532
She's dating Rafael.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.568
What?! No.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.037
Oh, don't worry, it's just
a business arrangement.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.039
He's using her
to get the hotel back.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.576
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.544
That's pretty much how Petra
hoped Jane would react.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.119
Is Adam usually late?
He's probably driving,

16:59.152 --> 17:01.454
and he doesn't text and drive,
which is a good thing.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.290
And I met Katherine, by the way.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.059
I have to admit,
I was kind of

17:06.093 --> 17:10.330
surprised that you were dating
someone with so much...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.599
personality.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.334
Until Petra explained

17:14.367 --> 17:16.203
that you're just
using her for business.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.770
I'm with Katherine
because I like her.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.606
And because
she's good for business.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.510
We have a mutually beneficial
relationship.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.578
It's not like
she's meeting Mateo.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.080
By the way,
being 15 minutes late

17:27.114 --> 17:28.115
does not bode well
for being responsible.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.316
Adam. Hi.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.384
Hey, hi. Sorry.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.752
Sorry, dude,

17:32.785 --> 17:34.621
traffic was
crazy and, um,

17:34.654 --> 17:36.656
Waze was "waze" off.
(giggles)

17:36.689 --> 17:40.193
No problem, dude.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.229
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, all right.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.498
Let's time warp past
this awkward part, shall we?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.567
So, you have
experience with kids?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.870
Uh, not really, um,
but I'm-I'm a big kid at heart.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.373
And he's also
totally mature.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.374
Right.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.642
Super mature.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.645
Like with-with everything:
um, paying bills,

17:58.678 --> 18:01.848
not putting banana peels
in the garbage disposal.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.216
Oh.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.353
Okay, let's move forward
a little.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.354
So do you have a car seat?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.621
Does Mateo still
need a car seat?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.223
I have a car seat.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.293
Ugh, I can't.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.427
Okay, hypothetical.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.629
The three of you are on
your roof, you get locked out.

18:16.663 --> 18:17.630
Do you jump off?

18:17.664 --> 18:19.466
No!

18:19.499 --> 18:20.500
I call for help.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.634
Trick question.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.703
Mateo should never
be on your roof.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.639
(phone vibrates)

18:26.673 --> 18:28.541
Sorry, it's Petra;
she's got the girls.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.480
I'm failing the test.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.314
I am so sorry.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.383
He's just in a bad mood
and stressed.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.886
Well, I am so proud of you for
getting your yellow belt, Ellie.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.922
Would you mind putting Mommy
on the phone for one minute?

18:42.955 --> 18:45.392
Oh. Hello?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.794
Why the hell would you
tell Jane about Katherine?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.929
Oh. Was I not supposed to?
I didn't know.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.731
Oh, please.
PETRA: Fine. You wouldn't

18:51.764 --> 18:53.666
listen to me, so I thought
maybe you'd listen to her.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.202
Why would I listen
to either of you?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.370
Because we're all a family.
RAFAEL: Yes, exactly!

18:57.404 --> 18:59.539
And I'm taking care of things
for my family!

18:59.572 --> 19:02.409
You're on a plane with Mateo and
the plane loses cabin pressure

19:02.442 --> 19:03.943
and the oxygen masks drop.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.678
Who do you put
the mask on first?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.214
Mateo, definitely
Mateo, sir.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.182
Trick question.
Never be on a plane with Mateo!

19:09.216 --> 19:10.850
(groans)
(groans, chuckles)

19:12.752 --> 19:14.821
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And
speaking of unhappy fathers...

19:14.854 --> 19:17.824
Why would she want to
give birth in a kiddie pool?

19:17.857 --> 19:20.193
It's a birthing pool.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.261
Educate yourself

19:21.294 --> 19:24.197
about home births
before you start freaking out.

19:25.998 --> 19:31.838
Fine. I will look into this
ridiculous home birth business.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.707
Which he did, for the record.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.476
*

19:45.685 --> 19:48.521
Well, my mind is
officially closed.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.858
Now I'm even more outraged
about the idea of a home birth

19:51.891 --> 19:52.925
than I was before.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.728
I... forbid it.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.464
You can't forbid it.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.866
Well, I need to find
a way to forbid it.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.801
There's no point in talking
to Darci; she's only gonna do

20:01.834 --> 20:03.470
the opposite of what you say.
(knock on door)

20:03.503 --> 20:05.905
I just wish there was
some way to convince her.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.643
Five-minute heads up till
your protoplasm scene, Rogelio.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.486
Ooh, looks like someone
is plotting something.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.887
Which makes sense.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.290
This is a telenovela,
after all.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.425
I need help, please.

20:25.458 --> 20:30.029
The hotel is so hard to sell,
and I'm all alone, Rose.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.433
I miss you so much, and...

20:33.466 --> 20:35.802
I can't even put up
a picture of you.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.570
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll remind you, she's speaking

20:37.604 --> 20:39.772
with her crime lord girlfriend
who is currently in prison.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.441
I swear to God,
sometimes it feels like

20:41.474 --> 20:43.676
I'm the one in prison.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.844
(sighs)

20:44.877 --> 20:46.813
Yeah, okay, okay.
Yes, okay, yes.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.915
That was insensitive.
I'm sorry.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.319
Can we please not fight?

20:52.352 --> 20:54.421
Okay. I love you.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.456
(knock on door)

20:56.489 --> 20:58.425
We need to talk.

20:58.458 --> 21:02.061
Um, did Anezka get Petra
to sign the papers?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.030
No, n-not yet.

21:04.063 --> 21:04.931
Then we don't.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.067
We are renegotiating
our piece of the deal.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.002
(scoffs)
Like hell we are.

21:10.036 --> 21:13.806
(chuckles)

21:13.840 --> 21:16.008
You do not want to cross me.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.311
Oh, please.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.613
I'm not scared of you, lady.

21:20.647 --> 21:24.584
I was dating an
international crime lord.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.353
You killed two people.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.021
She started a war in Ukraine
with Paul Manafort.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.624
There's no renegotiation.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.327
And stop showing kids

21:34.361 --> 21:35.495
your eyehole.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.096
It's gross.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.532
I feel terrible.
We both do.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.468
You should.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.935
But you know what?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.572
You were being
pretty awful to Adam.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.506
No, I wasn't.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.341
You were grilling him,

21:48.375 --> 21:49.676
not getting to know him.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.511
Because I want to make sure
my kid is safe.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.311
I have that right.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.414
Fine. If it'll make you
feel better,

21:54.447 --> 21:56.082
I'll make sure that Mateo's
never alone with Adam.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.617
Does that resolve your concern?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.686
Yeah. Okay. Fine.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.020
And how about you and Adam?

22:01.053 --> 22:02.555
I'll be cordial with him.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.357
But it doesn't mean
I like the guy.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.492
Me, neither.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.726
Mateo.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.861
What? If Daddy hates Adam,
I hate Adam.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.063
He's a stupid fartface!

22:18.638 --> 22:20.973
"Fartface" is not a nice word,
young man.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.942
You're on a time-out.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.944
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Honestly, I thought
it was funny, but,

22:24.977 --> 22:26.078
man, Jane was pissed.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.814
Don't worry, I will fix this.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.081
How?

22:29.115 --> 22:30.917
I'll just act like I like him.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.420
Mateo will see through it.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.854
You three need to go somewhere

22:34.887 --> 22:36.423
and bond, without me.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.657
How about a baseball game?

22:37.690 --> 22:38.825
That is not
necessary.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.827
Okay? Just invite Adam over,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.996
we'll act cool, and over time,
he'll forget this ever happened.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.866
Adam is important to me,
and he's sticking around.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.569
I know. Just give me two weeks.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.939
If it doesn't work, then
we'll do your baseball thing.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.876
Which brings us to...

22:56.909 --> 22:58.878
Have fun at the baseball game.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.750
Hey, before we go,
I finished your book.

23:03.783 --> 23:04.817
It was really good.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.454
Oh, oh...

23:07.487 --> 23:08.988
JANE:
Uh, "Really good"?

23:09.021 --> 23:10.490
"Really good" is what
I told the publisher

23:10.523 --> 23:11.958
about the cover
that I hated.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.894
Look. Romance novels
probably just aren't his thing.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.497
Plus, art is subjective.
Trust me.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.932
It's not like I think everything
your dad does is genius.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.671
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,
someone has high standards.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.806
So what's happening
with the book cover?

23:26.839 --> 23:29.041
Well, I just got another version
a few days ago.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.812
So now I have
three choices.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.017
Yikes. I'm no artist, but...

23:38.050 --> 23:39.886
these suck.
I know.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.021
And apparently, that's
their final offer.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.056
So which do you
hate the least?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.958
One, two or...

23:45.992 --> 23:48.027
UMPIRE:
Strike three. You're out!

23:48.060 --> 23:49.028
ADAM:
This is fun.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.029
RAFAEL:
Yeah, it's so much fun.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.598
I'm bored.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.065
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Me, too.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.535
Nine innings?
It should be three, tops.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.003
We just got here, buddy.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.538
Give it a chance.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.039
Hey, Mateo.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.709
Did you know that I work
with a lot of superheroes?

24:02.742 --> 24:06.212
Yeah. And I think that you
might have some powers.

24:06.245 --> 24:08.080
Me?
Let me test it.

24:08.114 --> 24:11.884
One thing that superheroes
can do is manipulate time.

24:11.918 --> 24:12.985
You see that scoreboard?

24:13.019 --> 24:13.986
Okay.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.254
Squeeze your eyes really tight.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.590
Okay, that's how
you freeze time.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.759
(gasps) Mateo, oh, my God.
Look at the scoreboard.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.093
It didn't change.
You did it, dude.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.996
You froze time!
I'm a real superhero.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.498
DIRECTOR:
Less like Superman,

24:25.532 --> 24:27.900
more like sperm.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.503
Good note.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.039
(grunting)

24:33.072 --> 24:34.741
And cut!

24:40.079 --> 24:42.181
What an amazing
performance.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.184
No one can do sperm like you.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.787
I'm so glad we went
with your script changes.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.723
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Wow. Rogelio is really
buttering him up.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.892
It's so great when someone can
admit that another idea

24:52.925 --> 24:56.028
is way, way better than his own.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.798
Isn't it? And since we're
talking about the greater good,

24:58.831 --> 25:02.001
would you consider
helping talk Darci

25:02.034 --> 25:07.239
into giving birth in the Ricky
Martin Celebrity Birthing Suite?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.542
Ah, now I get it.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.678
Look, Esteban,
this isn't about me or you.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.813
It's about a safe birth.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.683
I've been doing a lot
of research on home births,

25:16.716 --> 25:19.552
and it's dangerous
at Darci's age.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.687
Thirty-two?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.689
Sure.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.559
It just gets dicey over 28.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.128
Please, Esteban.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.263
I just want what's best
for both of them.

25:31.297 --> 25:35.234
Darci won't listen to me,
but she will listen to you.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.737
We're ready for you, Rogelio.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.285
(growling, grunting)

25:55.888 --> 25:58.925
(grunting)

25:58.958 --> 26:00.760
(shouting)

26:06.065 --> 26:08.601
Ooh, cotton candy!
Can I get some?

26:08.635 --> 26:12.338
Oh, you're gonna have
to ask your dad, dude.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.641
Oh, shoot, he's
on the move.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.743
Hey, I'm gonna need
your help, Mateo.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.178
Could you use your time-freezing
powers to help me catch him?

26:21.180 --> 26:24.050
I'm like Wonder Woman, Daddy.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.251
(chuckles)

26:25.284 --> 26:27.353
(phone chiming)

26:27.386 --> 26:30.589
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh, who's Tara?

26:32.391 --> 26:36.362
Uh-oh. Looks like somebody
wants to get to second base.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.736
One, two, three, freeze.
Ha! I'm getting a gummy worm.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.773
(laughs)

26:46.806 --> 26:49.341
Thank you for going.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.044
It seems like Mateo
finally warmed up to him.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.681
Yeah.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.983
Uh, what's with the face?

26:57.016 --> 26:59.251
Can we talk?

26:59.285 --> 27:01.688
DARCI:
We got to talk, right now.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.290
And I am going
to try to stay calm,

27:04.323 --> 27:07.827
because seething rage
is never good for a fetus.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.828
I agree with you.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.262
Wonderful!

27:10.296 --> 27:13.065
In the future,
if you don't agree with me,

27:13.099 --> 27:14.967
let's discuss it one-on-one,

27:15.001 --> 27:17.103
instead of you trying
to trick my lover

27:17.136 --> 27:19.105
into talking me
out of my choice.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.206
I'm not sure what...

27:20.239 --> 27:23.242
Rogelio, I am three days
overdue; don't mess with me.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.983
I'm giving birth
in a tranquil tub,

27:31.017 --> 27:34.120
with jazz music,
my beloved Esteban,

27:34.153 --> 27:35.822
and our doula Sequoia
by my side,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.123
whether you like it or not.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.390
What if something goes wrong?

27:38.424 --> 27:41.227
Then we'll drive
the 17 minutes to the hospital,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.696
where my O.B.
will be ready for us.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.864
I'm not stupid.

27:44.897 --> 27:45.965
I have
a contingency plan.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.099
But I want to try

27:47.133 --> 27:48.901
to do this my way.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.871
I've been waiting
almost 32 years...

27:51.904 --> 27:54.273
(coughs)

27:54.306 --> 27:57.376
I want to experience
the magic of natural childbirth.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.112
What if we take Sequoia
and the tub to the hospital?

28:00.146 --> 28:01.714
No! I'll chicken out,

28:01.748 --> 28:03.249
I'll get an epidural,
and I really want

28:03.282 --> 28:05.384
to feel every moment
of this amazing experience!

28:05.417 --> 28:07.286
It's not just about you.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.721
XIOMARA:
Yes, it is.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.489
Sorry.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.425
But it is all about her
right now.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.995
It's her body, and she
has the right to choose

28:16.028 --> 28:18.130
how she wants to give birth.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.132
Thank you, Xo.
Of course.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.368
And really, anything you need.

28:25.237 --> 28:29.175
Actually, I wouldn't mind
having the baby here.

28:29.208 --> 28:33.345
Nice big room, even closer
to a hospital just in case.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.082
Plus, way less mess at my place.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.053
ADAM:
You look tense.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.756
Yeah, well,
there's no easy way to say this.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.091
But...

28:45.124 --> 28:46.759
Raf caught a glimpse
of your phone

28:46.793 --> 28:49.528
and saw text messages
from somebody named Tara.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.497
Oh.
And her boobs.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.631
And it's okay.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.501
I mean, we haven't had
the "are we exclusive" talk yet.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.436
Of course we're exclusive.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.305
And, um...

28:59.338 --> 29:01.841
this is probably gonna ruin
the surprise a little bit,

29:01.874 --> 29:05.011
but Tara was helping me
with a project.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.079
For you.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.888
(chuckles softly)

29:15.922 --> 29:17.890
(whispers):
Oh, wow.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.425
(laughs)

29:19.458 --> 29:21.794
I, uh, I designed it.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.796
Um, Tara is the printer
that I use.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.798
I just thought
you would like to see

29:25.832 --> 29:28.067
what it would
look like in real life.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.137
We went back and forth
a few times, notes on the boobs.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.304
Hence the text.

29:32.338 --> 29:35.174
It's amazing.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.176
I thought you didn't
even like my book.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.878
What?

29:38.911 --> 29:40.212
I-I said it was really good.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.081
Exactly. That's all you said.

29:42.114 --> 29:46.352
Well, I-I'm more of a visual
person, not a words person.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.988
I guess this is
what I thought of it.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.225
I love this.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.528
Oh, wow, that woman's cleavage
is perfect.

29:57.964 --> 30:01.100
I am so sorry for jumping
to the worst conclusion.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.335
It's okay.
Not really.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.038
But I guess that's
what you're signing up for.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.440
My whole messy life.

30:08.474 --> 30:12.344
My nosy baby daddy and my
overprotective grandma.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.180
A kid.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.849
Now are you panicking?

30:16.883 --> 30:18.885
Not a chance.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.990
KATHERINE:
Mmm, I'm all in.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.159
Are you?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.532
Are you?

30:36.302 --> 30:39.005
You know I'm crazy about you.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.139
I just don't want
to misunderstand

30:40.172 --> 30:42.274
the nature of our relationship.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You mean that it's
a mutually beneficial

30:44.043 --> 30:45.544
business arrangement?

30:45.577 --> 30:50.116
Because I've had enough flings
since my divorce.

30:50.149 --> 30:54.520
So, I'm looking for something
more... serious now.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.256
So if that's not
what you want...

31:01.593 --> 31:04.163
We are on the same page.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.033
Great.
(laughs)

31:07.066 --> 31:09.068
So, can I meet your kids?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.441
I mean, yeah, I would love that.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.443
Hmm.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.445
Oh, it's just that...

31:19.478 --> 31:22.114
Jane has this really
strict three month rule,

31:22.148 --> 31:25.251
and if I push back at all,

31:25.284 --> 31:28.054
she turns into a
full-blown rageaholic.
Oh.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.389
Which brings us
to our little rageaholic.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.324
It's fine.
It happens to everybody.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.492
Don't sweat it, okay?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.265
So you're Jane.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.236
Hello, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

31:44.270 --> 31:45.537
Look, I'm a straight shooter.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.473
So I wanted to officially
introduce myself

31:47.506 --> 31:49.475
since I'm gonna be
a part of Rafael's life.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.343
And his kids' lives.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.378
What?

31:52.411 --> 31:53.479
Yeah.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.014
He wants to introduce me
to them.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.016
And just so you know,

31:57.049 --> 31:59.151
I'm not afraid of your temper.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.487
Excuse me?
I get it,

32:01.520 --> 32:03.255
you're a rageaholic.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.225
Well, I can
throw down, too.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.227
And I'm in this
for the long haul, sweetie.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.330
The Cortes group is a few weeks
away from buying this hotel,

32:11.363 --> 32:13.665
which makes me not only
Raf's girlfriend,

32:13.699 --> 32:16.602
but also your future boss.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.204
(chuckles)

32:23.042 --> 32:25.244
XIOMARA:
Are you hearing this?

32:25.277 --> 32:28.614
(Esteban and Darci moaning)
They're trying to induce.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.416
(loud moaning continues)

32:30.449 --> 32:32.251
Look...

32:32.284 --> 32:35.354
I'm sorry
for siding with Darci.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.290
I should have talked with you
about it privately.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.027
It's fine.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.429
Then-then what's going on?

32:43.462 --> 32:46.565
I mean, you've been
upset all day.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.501
Are you gonna make me
ask you three times in a row?

32:49.535 --> 32:51.470
What? I don't do that.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.372
What's wrong?
Nothing.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.207
Are you sure
there's nothing's wrong?

32:55.241 --> 32:57.643
Yes.
Are you really sure
there's nothing wrong?

32:57.676 --> 32:59.511
Okay, the thing is
that you're right.

32:59.545 --> 33:03.349
It's Darci's choice on
how she wants to give birth.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.318
But this is the first big
decision about our child,

33:06.352 --> 33:09.121
and she and Esteban
edged me out.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.691
And I'm afraid this is
the first of many

33:12.724 --> 33:14.560
series of thing they're
gonna edge me out of.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.163
And I already missed out
on Jane's birth

33:17.196 --> 33:19.031
and all of her "firsts,"

33:19.065 --> 33:20.566
and I don't want that
to happen again.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.700
DARCI:
Yes, baby!

33:21.733 --> 33:24.570
Make... it... happen!

33:24.603 --> 33:26.038
I'm sorry, Ro.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.439
Oh, no, no,
don't feel bad.

33:27.473 --> 33:30.209
This is why I didn't want
to say anything.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.744
What happened with Jane
is in the past.

33:32.778 --> 33:37.083
This time, I need to be there
from the beginning.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.718
And at this rate,
I'm gonna be

33:39.751 --> 33:41.753
on the sidelines for all of it.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.756
Darci and Esteban will be
the stars of the play

33:44.790 --> 33:47.459
and I will be the stagehand.

33:47.493 --> 33:51.430
And everyone knows that
stagehands are losers!

33:51.463 --> 33:53.099
Here's your water.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.301
Oh, thank you, Rudy.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.768
Okay, listen.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.704
I'm glad I know what
you're worried about,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.107
because now we can make sure
that doesn't happen.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.209
I'm coming to this birth
with you,

34:03.242 --> 34:06.178
and I'm gonna make sure that
you're just as much a part of it

34:06.212 --> 34:08.080
as Esteban.
ESTEBAN: I did it!

34:08.114 --> 34:09.515
I broke her water!

34:09.548 --> 34:11.117
We're in labor!

34:11.150 --> 34:12.151
(whoops, laughs)

34:17.156 --> 34:20.692
(screaming, panting)

34:20.726 --> 34:22.661
You got this, Mushy.

34:22.694 --> 34:23.462
You can do it.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.564
Yes, keep breathing.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.168
See? You're just as much
a part of this as Esteban.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.469
Okay, let's do this.
(Darci wails)

34:30.502 --> 34:32.238
ESTEBAN: Just like
we practiced.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.506
(panting)

34:37.443 --> 34:40.179
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And speaking of mama drama...

34:40.212 --> 34:41.513
What is it now, Mother?

34:41.547 --> 34:44.350
I know Katherine
is cover for Rafael.

34:44.383 --> 34:48.520
He's actually the one
buying the hotel. Yeah.

34:48.554 --> 34:52.291
And I will tell Dr. Luisa
right now

34:52.324 --> 34:56.462
unless you agree
to give us ten percent.

34:56.495 --> 35:00.366
And not Czech ten percent,
American ten percent.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.834
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And in that moment,
Petra found herself caught

35:02.868 --> 35:05.471
between a Czech
and a hard place.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.339
Okay.

35:07.373 --> 35:08.740
Ten percent.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.177
With the following
conditions.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.413
The day the deal closes,
you two have to go back

35:14.446 --> 35:15.614
to the Czech Republic.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.616
I'll pay you monthly.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.819
And if you ever step foot in
the U.S. again, payments stop.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.355
Deal.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.590
What's happening
with the Katherine deal?

35:24.623 --> 35:27.193
Well, I thought you didn't want
me to see Katherine anymore.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.895
Well, the calculation's changed.
Magda knows we're behind it.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.830
Look, if Luisa finds out
you're involved,

35:31.863 --> 35:33.465
she'll never trust
another outside investor.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.833
This is the only chance we have.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.868
And we need to move quickly.
RAFAEL: Hmm.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.471
Well, I guess morals
only take you so far, huh?

35:39.505 --> 35:40.906
Well, you already
slept with her.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.474
Might as well close the deal.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.643
Once you throw out the line,

35:44.676 --> 35:46.545
catch the freakin' fish.

35:51.617 --> 35:52.718
Uh-oh.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.653
What's wrong?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.588
Just a little annoyed.

35:56.622 --> 36:00.459
I mean, I-I wouldn't say
that I'm in a rage.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.828
Oh.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.265
Katherine called?

36:06.298 --> 36:08.567
Oh, no, no.
She didn't call.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.968
She came and confronted me.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.537
I'm really sorry.
I panicked.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.305
I knew you wouldn't want her
to meet Mateo,

36:13.339 --> 36:14.673
but I didn't want
to drive her away.

36:14.706 --> 36:15.741
Rafael!

36:15.774 --> 36:17.209
Can you even hear yourself?

36:17.243 --> 36:18.610
You're obviously
using her.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.946
And she told me
she's in it for the long haul.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.814
She'll be fine.
What are you even doing?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.216
I'm trying to get
my life back, Jane!

36:24.250 --> 36:25.684
I need to get
my life back.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.686
My money, my hotel.

36:27.719 --> 36:28.854
That is not your life.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.822
You have these great kids.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.625
Mateo worships
the ground that you walk on.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.427
And if you continue
to date somebody

36:35.461 --> 36:37.829
that you don't even like,
he will pick up on it.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.598
He picks up on everything.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.369
Take a step back.

36:43.402 --> 36:47.473
Look at the big picture--
everything you do have.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.477
(whispers):
Yeah.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.646
(sighs)

36:54.680 --> 36:58.350
Abuela is taking me
to get my cast off soon.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.718
You still good to watch Mateo?

36:59.751 --> 37:03.455
I actually have a meeting.

37:03.489 --> 37:07.526
I was thinking maybe...
Adam could watch him?

37:09.995 --> 37:13.432
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow,
she really did turn him around.

37:13.465 --> 37:14.966
The baby's turned around.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.935
(screams)
She's sunny side up,

37:16.968 --> 37:18.337
and that's why
it hurts so much.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.539
She needs water!
Get her water!

37:20.572 --> 37:22.774
(Darci screaming)

37:22.808 --> 37:24.843
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ugh,
I wish we could time warp this.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.279
I can't do this anymore.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.314
I quit.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.848
I want to go to the hospital.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.550
I need a freakin' epidural!
No.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.852
No, you don't.
I believe in you.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.687
Just push, Mush!
(mouthing)

37:40.692 --> 37:42.494
I didn't mean literally.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.364
You can do this, Darci!

37:45.397 --> 37:47.299
You've got this!

37:47.333 --> 37:48.400
You wanted to be in control
of the birth,

37:48.434 --> 37:50.702
then take control,
damn it!

37:50.736 --> 37:54.039
You said you wanted to feel the
magic of a natural childbirth

37:54.072 --> 37:57.443
because you've been waiting
for this for your whole life!

37:57.476 --> 37:58.510
All...

37:59.745 --> 38:01.780
...32 years!

38:01.813 --> 38:04.583
So keep going.
Push! Push!

38:04.616 --> 38:06.818
Yes, Mushy!
What he said.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.019
Push!

38:08.053 --> 38:10.522
Push!
(screaming)

38:10.556 --> 38:11.957
(gasps)

38:14.860 --> 38:16.428
(panting)

38:18.430 --> 38:20.532
ROGELIO:
We did it! We did it.

38:23.569 --> 38:26.338
*

38:30.108 --> 38:32.310
You know, you guys
could have worn swimsuits.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.046
Darci had a baby.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.448
I have a little sister!

38:38.950 --> 38:40.085
Yay!

38:40.118 --> 38:43.455
Hey, hey, hey,
congratulations.

38:43.489 --> 38:44.956
Mateo and I came up with
a little special celebration

38:44.990 --> 38:45.924
for you getting your cast off,

38:45.957 --> 38:49.428
but I guess it's a
double celebration now.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.562
You want to go show her?

38:50.596 --> 38:52.664
We made our own moves up.

38:52.698 --> 38:56.868
* Let's do the Time Warp again

38:56.902 --> 38:58.970
* It's just a jump to the left

38:59.004 --> 39:00.439
(Jane laughs)

39:00.472 --> 39:03.409
* And then a step
to the right *

39:03.442 --> 39:05.711
* Put your hands on your hips

39:05.744 --> 39:08.614
* You bring your knees
in tight *

39:08.647 --> 39:10.882
* But it's the pelvic thrust

39:10.916 --> 39:15.454
* That really
drives you insane *

39:15.487 --> 39:20.692
* Let's do the Time Warp again

39:20.726 --> 39:24.496
* Let's do the Time Warp
again... *

39:24.530 --> 39:26.432
(laughs)

39:26.465 --> 39:27.999
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay,
it's a really long song, so,

39:28.033 --> 39:30.769
let's time warp
through this "Time Warp."

39:33.004 --> 39:34.640
Thank you so much.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.108
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

39:37.142 --> 39:38.810
Oh, yeah, of course, buddy.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.546
Let's sit on the porch swing.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.881
That's where Mommy
has all her big talks.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.416
*

39:44.450 --> 39:45.617
Okay.
(chuckles)

39:47.653 --> 39:49.054
All right,
what's on your mind, Mateo?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.957
Well, just about my mommy.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.058
After Michael died,

39:53.091 --> 39:56.962
she cried for
a really long time.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.830
You know about Michael?

39:58.864 --> 40:01.500
Well, sometimes
she still cries.

40:01.533 --> 40:05.437
So don't hurt her feelings
and don't die, okay?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.707
Yeah, you got it, buddy.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.777
ROGELIO:
This is the perfect child.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.883
Have you ever seen
such perfect toes?

40:17.916 --> 40:21.052
Who knew toes could be
so adorable?

40:21.086 --> 40:23.522
Thank you for telling me
to get in the tub.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.524
I really needed that push.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.228
XIOMARA:
This is one lucky baby.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.097
She doesn't know it yet,

40:32.130 --> 40:35.467
but she has the best
father in the world.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.542
JANE (laughs):
Aw!

40:43.575 --> 40:47.245
I can't believe
I have a sister.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.780
(chuckles)

40:48.814 --> 40:50.549
We can see her tomorrow.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.718
Oh, and I heard
from the publisher.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.220
They approved your cover.
How cool is that?

40:55.253 --> 40:57.489
So cool.
Right?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.495
(sighs)

41:05.597 --> 41:06.665
Jane?

41:06.698 --> 41:07.999
Hmm, yeah?

41:09.868 --> 41:11.703
I'm panicking.

41:11.737 --> 41:14.773
*

41:14.806 --> 41:16.542
KATHERINE:
I wasn't expecting this.

41:16.575 --> 41:20.011
Well, I wanted to make sure
it was clear where I stand.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.083
(chuckles)
Hello.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.918
ALL:
Hello.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.220
Hello.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.221
My name's Carl.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.958
Rose sent me to help you
get the money quicker.

41:32.991 --> 41:33.992
(inhaler puffs)

41:34.025 --> 41:35.827
Really?

41:35.861 --> 41:38.797
(gasps)

41:38.830 --> 41:40.866
What did she say?
What-what should we do?

41:40.899 --> 41:43.268
We need to collect the insurance
on this hotel.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.670
How?

41:44.703 --> 41:48.206
We're gonna burn this place
to the ground.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.241
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay, now I'm panicking.
