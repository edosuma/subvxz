WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:12.009
(Man) So you say his car is missing as well?

00:12.138 --> 00:14.129
His truck, a Dodge Ram.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.972
| Xeroxed a copy of the registration.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.051
Is your husband distraught?

00:20.188 --> 00:23.100
Or have you sensed any change
in his demeanor?

00:23.232 --> 00:25.393
Well, he was...

00:25.526 --> 00:29.144
No. I mean, he was trying to finish a book.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.111
He's a writer.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.617
So there was some stress there,

00:33.743 --> 00:37.201
but, well, nothing that I hadn't...

00:39.874 --> 00:43.207
He have any business on the West Bank? Algiers, Gretna
maybe?

00:43.336 --> 00:47.249
Any reason whatsoever
to take the ferry to Algiers Point?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.838
No, I don't know of anything.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.883
What?

00:53.012 --> 00:55.048
What have you heard?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.924
A fella on the ferry two days ago
gets over to Algiers Point,

00:59.060 --> 01:02.348
tells the operator over there
he shared a smoke with a big man.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.596
Watches the guy walk
towards the front of the boat,

01:04.732 --> 01:07.439
turns around a second later,
big guy is gone.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.945
(Second man) Now, he didn't see
anyone go in the water,

01:10.071 --> 01:13.404
but he didn't see the big man
get off the boat in Algiers either.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.118
The...the truck.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.784
Was there a blue Dodge left on the ferry?

01:21.916 --> 01:24.703
— No, ma'am.
— In any event,

01:28.589 --> 01:30.921
I'm gonna run a photo
by the fella that made the report,

01:31.050 --> 01:33.416
see if he makes some kind of identification.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.795
If it was my husband
and he didn't get off in Algiers,

01:37.932 --> 01:41.140
he could have just gone back to Canal Street.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.351
— Round—trip joyride.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:43.479 --> 01:46.346
He could have easily gone back
in the ferry and rode to the East Bank.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.347
You're absolutely correct.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.484
You'll pardon me for this, but your husband...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.853
Could he have another girl?
Somebody on the side?

01:53.990 --> 01:56.197
No, it's not that.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.407
He drink? Take medications?

01:58.536 --> 02:01.118
No, and he quit smoking years ago,

02:01.247 --> 02:04.705
so that also doesn't match
this man on the ferry.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.246
All right. Of course we'll run a check
on the credit cards

02:07.378 --> 02:09.209
and see if there are any new charges.

02:09.338 --> 02:14.082
Yeah. Well, we'll be in touch, and you be
sure to call if you hear anything, huh?

02:14.218 --> 02:16.584
Um, hopefully he'll be back here soon enough.

04:02.493 --> 04:06.031
- (Snaps fingers)
— Davis, you are unrelenting.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.779
Mother, let me read you
from last month's OffBeat.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.249
To quote, "With the possible exception
of 5th Ward Weebie's

04:12.378 --> 04:14.084
"new bounce classic, Fuck Katrina,

04:14.213 --> 04:17.125
"McAlary has, with his four—song offering,

04:17.258 --> 04:20.921
"produced the most wonderfully sarcastic political
commentary since the storm.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.887
"His savage version of the Smiley Lewis standard Shame,
Shame, Shame

04:25.015 --> 04:27.973
"is worth the price of the EP alone."

04:28.102 --> 04:32.061
l have no idea
what a bounce classic is, darling.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.441
(Melba) You don't wanna know.

04:34.567 --> 04:38.936
Mother, I am not asking you guys to do
all that much more than I'm willing to do myself.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.438
Look. $2,200. That is my stake in this.
Cash on the barrel.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.987
— 2,200?
— He's dealing drugs.

04:45.119 --> 04:48.577
— What? No.
— That much cash coming out of his pocket?

04:48.706 --> 04:51.823
- The boy is dealing drugs.
— I will have you know, Melba,

04:51.959 --> 04:55.122
this is payment for the sales of my last record.
And you know what?

04:55.254 --> 04:58.291
I've actually netted more than $4,000
over the past two months.

04:58.424 --> 05:01.882
4,000? Well, what happened
to the rest of the money?

05:02.011 --> 05:04.093
(Chuckles)

05:04.221 --> 05:06.428
l...| had expenses.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.014
Look. For a full—length CD,

05:09.143 --> 05:11.976
I'm looking at studio time,
plus I gotta pay musicians.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.596
— When I'm done with that I gotta put...
— How much? How much?

05:15.733 --> 05:18.145
With pressing costs, maybe 7 to 8,000.

05:20.321 --> 05:23.358
I'll get your father to match your 2,200.

05:23.491 --> 05:27.734
— But that won't be enough.
— Then get...a...job.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.236
Yeah, you're right. (Chuckles)

05:32.166 --> 05:36.375
(Groans) What is that you're about
to put in your mouth?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.290
— For real, what is that?
— I'm not sure.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.538
Yellowtail, I think. Yellowtail?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.539
- Hamachi.
— Hamachi. Right.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.212
— Ugh.
— You wanna get up in some of this?

05:44.345 --> 05:47.428
Naw. Antoine Batiste is strictly
a cooked—fish—eating motherfucker.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.218
— You sure?
— Hell yeah. You've gotta roll that shit in batter

05:50.351 --> 05:52.683
and drop it in some grease
before you talk to me, bro.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.767
Some tempura for my man here.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.603
— Temp—what?
— Sit, bro.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.688
— I called you for a reason.
- All right.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.852
Pick.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.071
— Yeah?
— Yeah.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.525
Boom.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.404
— Toussaint?
— Yeah, a tribute gig

06:13.541 --> 06:16.123
to all that old—school R&B
from Cosimo's shop.

06:16.252 --> 06:19.744
lrma, Lloyd Price.
The man want a few days of rehearsal.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.620
Gig's Sunday. lnvitation only.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.248
— Suit and tie thing.
- How much?

06:24.385 --> 06:27.172
— 1,000 a man.
- Ooh!

06:27.304 --> 06:29.716
(Laughs) Baby!

06:29.848 --> 06:31.509
Yeah.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.259
What was in the other hand?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.261
Little Feat, two nights at the House of Blues.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.435
Rock band looking for a full horn section
the same weekend.

06:40.568 --> 06:44.356
— I can't do both, can I?
— Bless you, brother.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.275
Look, man. Just kill the gig.
I told Toussaint he was covered.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.524
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.276
Ah. New Orleans style. (Chuckles)

06:52.413 --> 06:54.119
Where the hot sauce?

06:55.583 --> 06:57.574
(Chuckling)

06:59.378 --> 07:01.334
(Music plays on radio)

07:04.717 --> 07:06.378
(Engine stops)

07:10.389 --> 07:12.675
OK, OK, I'm here.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.971
Why did you call me?
And who fixed your roof?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.845
— He did.
— Where did you get money for materials?

07:18.981 --> 07:22.599
— Saved up.
— That couldn't have been much profit for you.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.944
— I didn't do it for the money.
— Ah.

07:27.990 --> 07:32.484
Here's the deal, Riley.
I'm gonna drop my legal case against you,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.781
and then you're gonna help Mr. Reyes here.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.280
You're gonna fix up that second truck,
then I'm gonna pick out my own crew

07:38.417 --> 07:40.282
and go out roofing under your license.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.922
What you say, partner?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.838
— Thanks, ma'am.
- No, thank you.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.600
The least you could do, Riley,
is buy the young man a beer or two.

08:00.731 --> 08:01.720
All right.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.154
Nothing?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.579
Hey, Pop.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.373
Yeah, that's pretty.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.962
- All right.
— Yup. Mm—hm.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.503
Gonna need some more blue beads.
Call your sister.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.796
— She might still be down at the store.
- All right.

08:31.929 --> 08:34.716
— Hey, what happens if we don't finish?
— We always get finished.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.930
— Yeah, except for when we don't.
- Yeah.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.017
Then we pull out the glue gun,
put it to the damn fabric and make do.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.397
No glue gun. l'm old—time lndian.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.230
We're gonna have
Chief, Spy and Flag ready to roll.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.226
Yeah, Ronnie gonna run Flag.
I'm gonna run Spy.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.980
Strange times.
I ain't run Spy since Delmond came up.

08:52.116 --> 08:55.404
Even if you hadn't been arrested,
you wouldn't have been ready for Mardi Gras.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.619
Not true. I'm always working on my suit
till time run out.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.409
— No doubt, Chief.
— Always more to do to be the most pretty.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.249
Always gotta make one year's suit
prettier than the last one.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.539
Mm. If it was easy, everybody'd be lndian.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.754
Look who came up the street
when l was ringing her.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.669
- Hey, Davina.
— We need more blue beads.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.259
And some black thread, a couple of them.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.424
And what a man gotta do
to get some lunch?

09:16.557 --> 09:19.799
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Lunch sounds like a good idea.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.846
Oh, yeah. Come here, baby. Come here, baby.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.096
Darius, go help Davina
gather lunch for everybody.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.770
I swear. Next year, come Mardi Gras,
l'm—a stay in Houston.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.154
Hey, people from Houston
don't even say that shit.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.271
— (All laugh)
— (George) Sho' don't!

09:33.407 --> 09:36.023
(Janette) So what can you do
to make the money?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.985
Get a job.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.493
This is a mistake.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.005
What?

09:49.131 --> 09:50.541
New York, you.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.628
Well, we'll see, won't we?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.097
(Sighs) Don't go.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.096
Why not?

10:05.147 --> 10:08.856
— We're good together.
- Christ, Davis.

10:08.984 --> 10:11.851
That was the moment where you were supposed to say
that you love me,

10:11.987 --> 10:15.900
you can't live without me and if I stay,
we'll live happily ever after.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.024
Did, um...

10:19.161 --> 10:20.697
Did you want me to say that?

10:20.829 --> 10:22.330
(Laughing)

10:22.456 --> 10:25.869
Fuck,no.
| just wanted to see your face when I said it.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.710
Oh!

10:32.132 --> 10:33.338
Oh, God.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.332
I don't know how I'm gonna sell this place

10:35.469 --> 10:38.586
or who I'm going to sell it to,
the way it is right now.

10:39.765 --> 10:45.010
No walls, no...downstairs electric.
Blue tarp on the roof.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.476
It's a walkaway.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.183
Hey, give me one last day.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.774
- What?
— One day to convince you not to leave.

10:55.322 --> 10:59.486
- This is not about you, Davis.
— I know that, but I want a day.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.527
To do what?

11:04.873 --> 11:08.707
J‘ Gentilly to the Vieux Carre

11:08.836 --> 11:12.749
J‘ Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown

11:12.881 --> 11:15.293
J‘ Nah—nah—nah—nah

11:16.385 --> 11:18.842
J‘ Da—da—da—da... J‘

11:21.932 --> 11:25.800
— Hard to write a song, huh?
- You ever try?

11:25.936 --> 11:30.020
I'm just a player.
I don't even sing, really.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.732
— I've heard you sing.
— Just a little bit of harmony is all.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.651
Well, it's in me. It's gotta come out.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.115
I mean, sometimes a song just...

11:43.704 --> 11:46.571
pisses you off until you can find it
and you write it down.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.074
I don't know. I think I'd be embarrassed
to sing anything I wrote.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.871
Why?

11:56.091 --> 11:58.878
Lucinda Williams is gonna be
at Tip's tomorrow night.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.593
— You ever seen her?
- Not live, no.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.213
I love the Car Wheels album.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.425
You wanna go?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.558
— Not a date, missy. Just some music.
- (Annie laughs)

12:13.317 --> 12:15.899
If we make enough in the square today, sure. Why not?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.441
J‘ Gentilly to the Vieux Carre

12:20.574 --> 12:24.613
J‘ Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown...

12:24.745 --> 12:27.452
J‘ Jockamo fee—nah—nay J‘

12:27.581 --> 12:28.821
Huh?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.868
J‘ Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown

12:34.004 --> 12:37.667
J‘ Singing jockamo fee—na—nay

12:37.799 --> 12:40.927
(Both)
J‘ This city will never drown J‘

12:42.012 --> 12:43.877
(Laughs)

12:44.014 --> 12:47.757
That's all I got for you.
It rhymes, anyway.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.932
— (Car door closes)
— (Distant barking)

13:13.377 --> 13:15.618
(Doorbell chimes)

13:16.797 --> 13:18.788
(Music playing)

13:45.325 --> 13:48.533
(Man) It was past Chalmette,
almost to English Turn.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.950
- A tug captain called it in.
— You're lucky it wasn't longer.

13:52.082 --> 13:56.200
This time of year, a body will
sometimes stay down a week or more.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.172
— What I meant was...
— Mama?

14:04.678 --> 14:06.043
Go upstairs, honey.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.346
I'll be with you in a minute.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.761
— All right.
- OK.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.185
Call us in the morning.
We'll deal with everything that is.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.226
(lnhales sharply)

14:30.370 --> 14:31.985
(Sofia) No!

14:33.749 --> 14:35.034
No!

14:50.432 --> 14:51.842
Holy fuck.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.760
Hey.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.439
— I know this dude.
— Who?

15:01.568 --> 15:05.152
Guy fell off the ferry
and drowned in the river.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.738
I taught his daughter some piano.
His wife is my lawyer.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.784
Oh, God.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.121
I know him too. That's Cray.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.699
Toni's husband. Oh, God.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.498
How do you fall off a ferry?

15:25.258 --> 15:28.091
- Poor wife.
— Daughter too.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.462
Oh, this town.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.260
— Don't say that.
- What?

15:35.560 --> 15:38.097
You'll see. Your day begins tomorrow.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.472
— Tomorrow? Why not today?
— The day requires a plan

15:41.608 --> 15:43.599
and I'm putting that plan into effect.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.442
Davis has a plan.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.389
Thank you, Miss Williams.

16:26.069 --> 16:29.277
Sounds like every motherfucker
up in there is spinning.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.867
— Everyone got the charts?
- Yes, sir.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.612
- (Murmuring)
— All the pages?

16:38.748 --> 16:41.831
These are the original arrangements
you're looking at.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.995
(Piano playing)

16:43.128 --> 16:44.993
- Hey, man.
— What's happening?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.246
— You getting a suit made for you?
— Horns are, bro.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.966
We're gonna do that old—school thing,
like some harvest gold tuxes or some shit.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.925
(Toussaint) Harvest gold?
(Man) Yeah.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.090
Let's try blue sharkskin, black lapel.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.555
I'm trying to move you all up in class here.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.015
(Laughter)

17:00.395 --> 17:02.431
| always wanted to do a gig like this,
Mr. Toussaint.

17:02.564 --> 17:06.273
Well, now you are. But first things first.
Let's get the music down.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.108
Up first will be the legendary Mr. Price.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.900
That's the piece where
I'll play the first chord in D—flat on the piano,

17:13.033 --> 17:15.069
the horns will come in on the six,

17:15.202 --> 17:18.410
then on the two twice,
the one, the major seven,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.824
back up to one and we're off.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.575
- Are you ready, Lloyd?
— Let's do it, boss. I'm ready to go.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.996
Everybody.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.126
J‘ The night was clear

17:30.258 --> 17:33.500
J‘ And the moon was yellow

17:34.721 --> 17:38.589
J‘ And the leaves came

17:38.725 --> 17:43.719
J‘ Tumbling down

17:43.855 --> 17:47.268
J‘ l was standing on the corner

17:47.400 --> 17:50.938
J‘ When I heard my bulldog bark

17:51.071 --> 17:53.107
J‘ He was barking at the two men

17:53.240 --> 17:56.152
J‘ Who were gambling in the dark

17:58.119 --> 18:01.532
J‘ It was Stagger Lee and Billy

18:02.749 --> 18:05.741
J‘ Two men who gambled late

18:05.877 --> 18:07.868
J‘ Stagger Lee threw seven

18:08.004 --> 18:11.496
J‘ Billy swore that he threw eight

18:11.633 --> 18:12.964
Look out, Stagger!

18:13.093 --> 18:14.629
J‘ Stagger Lee...

18:14.761 --> 18:19.346
The public records request
on the Danzinger Bridge incident can wait.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.260
There's no deadline on those.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.806
But you might have a hearing later
in the week in the Jefferson Parish jail suit.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.145
Oh. Ask for a postponement,

18:27.274 --> 18:29.185
but it's Judge Portis, so he might stiff you.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.603
— When he hears the reason...
- Oh, and... Oh, God.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.567
And the Brooks thing. Um...

18:33.697 --> 18:37.064
His sister needs to agree
to a second autopsy.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.361
She's resistant,
but it's the only way we'll ever...

18:39.494 --> 18:41.860
Toni, stop. Just stop.

18:43.123 --> 18:47.036
I'm gonna go over every file.
I'm not gonna let anything slip. I promise.

18:47.168 --> 18:51.457
None of this is important to you right now.
None of it.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.463
- How's Sofia?
— Uh, still sleeping. Thank God.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.431
She cried until dawn.

19:01.391 --> 19:05.134
| just don't understand how...he...

19:08.189 --> 19:11.272
My mom's flying from St. Pete
and she'll come straight from the airport.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.392
lf Sofia wakes before then, tell her to call me.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.816
Of course, go.
Do what you need to do. I'm right here.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.863
It's just for a week or two.
She's coming in from Seattle

19:21.995 --> 19:24.236
and it's really her apartment,
I'm just subletting.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.910
— It's cool. Don't worry about it.
— I like having you here though, you know.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.625
As soon as she clears out,
you can come back.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.790
You don't have to go back to Sonny.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.129
If you don't want to, I mean.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.125
- I know.
— I could make some calls or...

19:38.261 --> 19:41.003
It's no problem.
I got a line on a couple of good places.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.130
Really. You've been great.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.384
(Music on radio)

19:54.152 --> 19:56.017
— Daddy.
— (Grunts)

19:56.154 --> 19:58.065
— You need to get some sleep.
- (Sighs)

19:58.198 --> 20:01.565
Come on, Pop. You're dragging.
Go and get yourself a couple of hours.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.566
— You'll work twice as fast.
— Yeah.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.534
(Grunts) Maybe so.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.549
(Albert) Wake me in time for dinner.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.093
(Door creaks, shuts)

20:23.223 --> 20:24.838
Hey.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.102
You think we're gonna finish
two more suits by tomorrow night?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.648
I can break my suit down,
help George build up.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.271
Help my Spy and my Chief come strong,
then that's what we do.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.445
Nah. What we need is to keep working,
get all three ready,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.113
then come out together like always.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.113
— We ain't gonna finish.
— I'm with Delmond.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.205
We need to break mine down

20:51.334 --> 20:54.451
so the front and the back can come strong, and we bring
nothing but fire.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.420
You gonna wear your old suit?

20:57.549 --> 20:59.881
Anything and everything for Chief.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.136
She a cold bitch. Katrina.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.927
Oh, yeah.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.892
Hold up. Who gonna tell your father?

21:11.020 --> 21:13.056
- I'll do it.
— (All chuckle)

21:14.732 --> 21:17.064
- OK.
— I might tell him it was y'all's idea,

21:17.193 --> 21:19.184
but I'll definitely tell him.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.586
(Chimesjingling)

21:45.180 --> 21:46.920
(Woman) Hi.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.763
l'm Paige. Paige Royer.

21:49.893 --> 21:51.008
Hi, Paige.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.142
Nice tats.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.157
Annie!

22:06.284 --> 22:07.569
(Distant barking)

22:07.702 --> 22:09.693
Annie.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.595
— For starters, no animal sacrifice.
- Agreed.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.715
No on—air commentary
disparaging of station management.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.933
- Agreed.
— No mocking

22:34.062 --> 22:35.848
of the pledge—drive compilations,

22:35.980 --> 22:39.097
OZ umbrellas or other station swag.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.604
- Agreed.
— You will fully involve yourself

22:42.737 --> 22:45.228
— in fundraising for the coming pledge drive.
- Oh, agreed.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.196
I mean, that is why you pay me,

22:47.325 --> 22:50.192
since playing music is deemed
unworthy of an honest salary, so...

22:50.328 --> 22:53.195
And you will comply
with any set—list requirements

22:53.331 --> 22:55.538
necessitated by
station promotional campaigns.

22:57.335 --> 22:58.791
— Yeah?
— Yeah. Yeah.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.127
All right. Early morning shift is open.

23:01.256 --> 23:04.419
— You can start tonight if you feel up for it.
— OK, Darnell.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.466
(Man) Papa's little children need shoes.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.429
(Second man) They need shoes.
I need a horn.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.392
— You got some hoodoo on these ones.
— They ain't getting that.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.101
- $5. There you go, five.
— (Third man) Another five.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.099
(Fourth man) Another five too? Man, come on.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.648
- There you go.
— (Fourth man) Oh, man.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.065
- All right.
— Oh, man.

23:27.198 --> 23:31.111
It's good to be back down here.
Got a chance to take your money again.

23:31.244 --> 23:34.702
Man, please. You've been putting my kids through school
for a decade now.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.241
(Chuckling)

23:37.667 --> 23:39.999
— Y'all play much?
— No, only when we get together.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.459
A friendly game though.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.250
Just humble musicians trying to pass the time.

23:44.382 --> 23:48.466
Shit. I ain't all that humble,
not with these you dealt me.

23:48.595 --> 23:52.053
I'll see that two and raise you five.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.968
- There you go.
— (Chips clatter)

23:55.101 --> 23:58.138
Last time we did this
was the birthday concert

23:58.271 --> 23:59.852
— for Cosimo, wasn't it?
- Right.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.313
— Yeah, a couple of years back.
— Yeah, that's right.

24:02.442 --> 24:06.105
Man, I don't know who dealt this mess,
but I ain't got no hand.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.102
Oh, man. Crikey.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.982
Uh, look here.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.700
Uh, y'all take an lOU here?

24:14.829 --> 24:17.662
Because you know
I got the money coming from this gig.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.202
— (Chuckling)
- No shit.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.993
Sit down, young'un.
Give this pilgrim some chips.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.121
All right.

- Oh, that's Juvenile.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.427
Newjoint that just came out.
It's called Reality Check.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.475
Y'all let me sleep too long.

24:43.608 --> 24:47.066
- | only needed an hour or so.
— Look to me like you need an hour or so more.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.145
What...

24:51.532 --> 24:53.614
That was my call, Pop.

24:53.743 --> 24:56.325
I knew we wouldn't finish three suits in time,
so I spoke to it.

24:56.454 --> 24:59.617
Ronnie stepped up, said he'd wear one
of his old suits with a new crown and flag.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.240
He come so strong,
ain't nobody gonna be able to touch him.

25:02.377 --> 25:06.495
Your call, huh? Put me to sleep
and make moves like you were Chief.

25:07.590 --> 25:11.458
Right now I'm just a tired-ass fool
trying to make sure we got it done.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.094
What the hell kind of Chinese shit
is that I'm listening to?

25:18.226 --> 25:22.560
Don't pay him no mind. He only saying that
'cause that's what Cab Calloway told Dizzy.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.930
"Don't be playing
that Chinese shit in my band."

25:25.066 --> 25:26.977
Cab was wrong, but I'm right.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.543
back with you
after my brief political sabbatical.

25:46.671 --> 25:51.256
That was Slidell, Louisiana's own Juvenile
off his new one with Animal.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.045

Before that, Miss Cheeky Blakk

25:56.013 --> 26:00.222

bringing his Fireman from Tha Carter ll.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.969
So, it is, uh, way past midnight

26:04.105 --> 26:06.847
on this first St. Joseph's Day since the storm,

26:06.983 --> 26:09.269
and what I'm wondering
is whether we're gonna see

26:09.402 --> 26:11.393
some lndians on those streets.

26:12.363 --> 26:16.777
Now I know a lot of folks aren't home
and a lot more haven't been able to mask,

26:16.909 --> 26:19.616
so I'm gonna pull up from the local bounce

26:19.746 --> 26:22.112
and dedicate this one
to anyone who's home,

26:22.248 --> 26:24.580
working hard this morning

26:24.709 --> 26:26.950

29:56.963 --> 29:59.295
J‘ And they don't bow down
J‘ We don't bow down

29:59.423 --> 30:01.709
J‘ On nobody's ground
J‘ Nobody's ground

30:01.842 --> 30:06.506
J‘ Oh, how we love
to hear you call us lndian Red J‘

30:07.890 --> 30:09.881
(Police radio chatter)

30:17.858 --> 30:21.021
You are back! It's so good.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.690
Oh. Oh my.

30:23.823 --> 30:26.735
- Morning.
— OK. Six months and I'm back.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.482
Oh, don't I know it.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.484
This is it.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.497
(Davis) OK.

30:36.836 --> 30:39.828
— Are you ready?
— You out your motherfucking mind, Davis.

30:39.964 --> 30:43.297
- Seriously.
— Sh. We're doing good here.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.335
(Chuckles)

30:49.557 --> 30:51.718
Oh, Christ. (Laughs)

30:51.851 --> 30:54.183
— What the fuck, Davis?
— | asked for a day.

30:54.311 --> 30:58.054
That day began four minutes ago,
nine am Central Standard Time.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.055
Beignets from Du Monde.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.854
Beignets don't travel all that well, Davis.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.444
John, if you will begin the obsequies

31:05.573 --> 31:08.110
- and formalities.
— Dawg, you woke the lady up.

31:08.242 --> 31:11.826
He came to my house this morning,
said it was an emergency.

31:11.954 --> 31:14.240
You live around the corner.
She's moving to New York.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.240
— That's not an emergency?
- He's back at OZ,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.743
said he wouldn't play my stuff
unless I stepped up on this one.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.247
He knows I'm kidding.
Dude, come on. It's your moment.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.252
J‘ If you ever

31:30.389 --> 31:33.472
J‘ Change your mind

31:33.601 --> 31:36.138
J‘ About leaving

31:36.270 --> 31:39.103
J‘ Leaving me behind

31:39.231 --> 31:43.770
J‘ Oh, bring it to me

31:43.903 --> 31:46.645
J‘ Bring your sweet loving

31:46.781 --> 31:49.944
J‘ Bring it on home to me

31:50.076 --> 31:53.034
J‘ Yeah, yeah

31:53.162 --> 31:55.574
J‘ I'll give you jewelry

31:55.706 --> 31:58.948
J‘ And money too

31:59.085 --> 32:04.125
J‘ That ain't all I'll do for you

32:04.256 --> 32:08.625
J‘ Yes, if you would bring it to me

32:08.761 --> 32:11.173
J‘ Bring your sweet loving

32:11.305 --> 32:14.263
J‘ Bring it on home to me

32:14.391 --> 32:19.055
J‘ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah J‘

32:19.188 --> 32:21.804
Whoo—hoo! Thank you.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.057
Dude sounds just like Sam Cooke.

32:25.027 --> 32:27.518
I fucking sound like John Boutte.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.988
But, darling, you have a blessed day
and I hope you reconsider.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.358
Thank you.
That was unbelievably sweet.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.735
Let me get dressed
and we can have those on the porch.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.329
- Nah, it's cool. I got a taxi coming.
— Well, thank you, Mr. Boutte. Really.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.949
— You owe me
- (Chuckles)

32:43.796 --> 32:47.163
That moment...can't happen in New York.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.093
It's still good. You can admit it.

32:57.226 --> 33:00.593
Get dressed. New Orleans needs you.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.972
(Bell dinging)

33:11.615 --> 33:14.402
— (Car door opens, closes)
— Found it this morning?

33:14.535 --> 33:16.526
Yeah. Patrol unit ran the tag.

33:17.788 --> 33:20.165
I'm sorry, Toni. Really.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.161
— Have they, uh...
— No.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.285
That's why I called you.

33:27.464 --> 33:30.206
— I'm worried he...
— I understand.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.959
Look. I'm...

33:34.096 --> 33:36.553
gonna take a walk up the street

33:36.682 --> 33:40.721
and maybe get a cup of coffee
with my friends over there.

33:40.853 --> 33:44.095
The truck's unlocked.
The glove compartment's open.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.517
- Did you...
— If you find anything,

33:47.568 --> 33:50.560
you take it home with you, all right?

33:50.696 --> 33:54.564
Anything you find around the house
that explains anything,

33:56.202 --> 33:58.193
go on and hold onto that too.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.242
- Terry...
— Think about your daughter.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.454
She needs to believe.

34:09.256 --> 34:11.167
I'm sorry, Toni.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.291
I'm sorry for your loss.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.598
(Sobs)

35:09.149 --> 35:12.277
(Ship's foghorn, distant)

35:20.536 --> 35:22.527
(Compartment closes)

36:01.452 --> 36:04.694
J‘ Tell your mama and papa too

36:04.830 --> 36:08.414
J‘ I wanna spend my life with you

36:33.025 --> 36:35.311

J‘ I love you, yes indeed
J‘ Do-do, do-do

36:56.173 --> 36:58.255

J‘ Do-do, do-do

J‘ Cha—dooky—doo
J‘ Cha—dooky—doo

37:09.436 --> 37:11.176
J‘ Uh—huh—huh

37:11.313 --> 37:13.929
J‘ Cha—dooky—doo
J‘ Do-do-do! J‘

37:14.066 --> 37:16.773
Not bad. Not bad.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.108
— And Renard?
— Yeah?

37:18.237 --> 37:22.480
If you want another chorus to go with that solo, and you're
feeling it, it's yours.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.449
Let's take a half-hour break
and set up for lrma's number.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.238
All right, who's dealing?

37:27.371 --> 37:29.612
- (Laughter)
— Are you serious, man?

37:29.748 --> 37:32.205
— You're addicted, son.
— Say, bro.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.292
I'm down $100.
Y'all gotta give me a chance to get even.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.412
(Irma Thomas) You all playing poker?

37:37.548 --> 37:39.914
Oh, Lord! A shark smells blood.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.961
- Who? Irma?
— At poker? She'll kill you dead.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.927
(Laughs) Y'all scared of Miss lrma?

37:46.640 --> 37:49.473
- Naw.
— Stakes?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.392
A dollar, five and ten.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.181
Chip me up here.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.103
Oh.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.731
All right.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.814
(Music on radio)

38:05.951 --> 38:09.159
Hey, the live oaks. There's nothing like 'em.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.280
Come on, Davis.
They got trees in New York.

38:12.416 --> 38:15.658
— Not like these.
— Davis, two words. Central Park.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.833
— But...
— No buts. No buts. Central Park. Am I right?

38:22.176 --> 38:24.007
Score one for the Apple.

38:24.136 --> 38:27.003
— (Davis) Ow.
— One to one.

38:28.307 --> 38:31.424
If it's the cost of a postmortem,
maybe my office can subsidize.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.425
Ain't the money. (Exhales)

38:33.562 --> 38:35.268
But if we're ever going to find out...

38:35.397 --> 38:38.685
What is there to find out
we can't already guess?

38:44.823 --> 38:48.361
— My brother's gone. A lot of people gone.
- (Floorboards creaking)

38:48.494 --> 38:52.078
And the ones left,
we got to be about the day to day.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.821
(Door closes)

38:54.833 --> 38:58.291
Hear my mama getting up. You take care.

39:05.344 --> 39:08.086
Be sure give Toni my regrets
about her husband and all, hear?

39:08.222 --> 39:09.883
OK.

39:22.110 --> 39:26.444
Hey, it would have been Uglesich's for lunch

39:26.573 --> 39:29.280
if they were still open, or Parasol's,

39:29.409 --> 39:31.661
but I know you prefer the shrimp
over the roast beef.

39:31.787 --> 39:35.029
— Mm.
— You can't get these in New York City.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.542
They have sandwiches.

39:37.668 --> 39:39.875
Heros, subs.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.039
Po'boys aren't sandwiches.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.709
They're a way of life.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.715
What's next on my day?

39:48.762 --> 39:50.423
A nap.

39:52.099 --> 39:57.059
That's another thing they probably don't have in sad—ass
Gotham City.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.389
(Music playing in distance)

40:03.652 --> 40:05.643
Annie, I'm sorry.

40:07.030 --> 40:10.113
- Me too.
— Come home.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.618
- She was in our bed.
— Then we get a new bed.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.285
- I need time.
— OK, I'll wait, but let's play together.

40:19.418 --> 40:23.752
- I'm writing songs now. We should...
— Look. If it happens, it happens, OK?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.257
No, I mean let's really do it, Annie.

40:26.383 --> 40:29.625
— You and me together.
- Sonny, I need time,

40:29.761 --> 40:33.424
and I need to be able to play when I want
with who I want.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.556
You have to see that.

40:42.316 --> 40:44.307
You're so much better than me...

40:44.443 --> 40:46.559
as a player.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.444
You're leaving me behind.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.773
I wasn't gonna leave you.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.622
And now?

41:17.601 --> 41:19.592
(Ship's horn)

41:24.650 --> 41:26.641

— We look correct, don't we?
— Back in the day, yeah.

44:56.653 --> 45:00.237
Well, how about after the gig
we go someplace and keep the game going?

45:00.365 --> 45:04.153
— I need a chance to bounce back.
— lrma got you bad, bro.

45:04.286 --> 45:07.824
— Oh, I just need another few hands is all.
—(Laughs)

45:07.956 --> 45:11.073
(Toni) You told her it was our only chance
to document the injuries, huh?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.165
You explained that, right?

45:13.295 --> 45:15.206
I made the case you would make, Toni.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.922
She heard me. She did.
She just doesn't want to go there.

45:19.050 --> 45:23.214
I don't know, Toni. It's like the truth
doesn't set them free sometimes.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.302
It's just another burden they have to bear.

45:26.308 --> 45:29.892
But you don't need to be worrying about any
of this now. What about what you need?

45:31.605 --> 45:34.142
What about the arrangements
for Creighton?

45:35.901 --> 45:39.610
Went to the lawyer today, unsealed the will.

45:39.738 --> 45:42.024
No surprises.

45:42.157 --> 45:44.273
He wanted a second line.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.401
- Yeah?
— Right there in the will.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.738
Even named the guys he wanted.

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:57.628
- You take care, Jacques.
— You show them how to cook in New York.

1:01:57.756 --> 1:01:59.371
(Janette) Think so?

1:02:16.609 --> 1:02:18.850
Welcome anytime, right?

1:02:20.613 --> 1:02:23.400
— What did I do right?
- (Chuckles)

1:02:34.293 --> 1:02:36.284
I don't have a place right now,

1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:39.127
so maybe in a couple of weeks...

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:42.089
— If it's a problem...
- It's a nightmare.

1:02:42.217 --> 1:02:45.129
- (Laughs)
— l'm devastated by this.

1:02:45.262 --> 1:02:47.924
(Whispers) Yeah.

1:02:50.309 --> 1:02:52.595
l have a sofa...

1:02:52.728 --> 1:02:54.969
if you feel that...

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:57.721
I mean, I would stay on the sofa.

1:02:57.858 --> 1:03:01.146
— You. I mean, you could stay on the...

1:03:01.278 --> 1:03:04.145

1:05:19.083 --> 1:05:21.540
— Jacques, where you at?
— On the road. You?

1:05:21.668 --> 1:05:24.580
No, Iwasjust out back
closing everything up.

1:05:24.713 --> 1:05:26.795
Yeah, Mama and 'em left early this morning.

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:29.791
But I'm sticking. What's up?

1:05:29.927 --> 1:05:31.918
(Jacques speaking)

1:05:32.054 --> 1:05:34.796
What? I'll go get it. No problem.

1:05:34.932 --> 1:05:37.799
— (Jacques continues speaking)
— Yeah.

1:05:39.186 --> 1:05:42.804
Oh, and tell boss lady not to worry.
I got this, all right?

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:44.771
- OK.
— All right.

1:05:48.112 --> 1:05:52.071
All right. Where the hell are my keys at?

1:05:54.451 --> 1:05:56.362
Ah.

No.

What you doing? Car's running.

1:06:09.174 --> 1:06:11.130
I'm looking for my copy
of Baby Dodds' record

1:06:11.260 --> 1:06:13.842
— with Danny Barker.
— Are you crazy?

1:06:13.971 --> 1:06:16.337
— And what's all this?
— That's my mama's lamp,

1:06:16.473 --> 1:06:18.179
me and maestro, some LPs out of print.

1:06:18.308 --> 1:06:20.845
We don't have room for any of that.
We're full up as it is.

1:06:20.978 --> 1:06:22.639
Come on!

1:06:31.697 --> 1:06:34.655
— Oh, yeah!
- Batiste!

1:06:39.663 --> 1:06:41.824
(Man) See you in a few days, bats.

1:06:41.957 --> 1:06:43.948
(Baby crying)

1:06:48.046 --> 1:06:50.173
Look. Why don't I just follow you?

1:06:50.299 --> 1:06:53.211
— Put all my stuff in my car.
— We've been through this, Antoine.

1:06:53.343 --> 1:06:55.925
That thing's liable to break down again
or we get separated.

1:06:56.054 --> 1:06:58.511
Get in the goddamn car, God damn it.

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:01.017
We're getting out too goddamn late as it is.

There she is.

1:07:24.374 --> 1:07:26.490
(Janette) Here I am at last.

1:07:26.627 --> 1:07:30.245
— (Door shuts)
— 16 hours to Huntsville. Who'd have thought?

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:32.086
- Hi.
— (Man on TV) ..75 miles per hour.

1:07:32.216 --> 1:07:35.208
— Thank God my baby's home.
— Hey, Mama.

1:07:35.344 --> 1:07:37.881
— I'll get you some coffee.
— OK.

1:07:38.889 --> 1:07:40.800
— Are you hungry?
— No, I'm good.

1:07:40.933 --> 1:07:43.094
(TV)
..forecast is for a category five at landfall,

1:07:43.227 --> 1:07:45.218
so expect a very, very, devastating hurricane.

1:07:45.354 --> 1:07:47.265
Still headed straight for New Orleans.

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:50.309
— (TV) Here's a projected path here...
- Here you go, sweetie.

1:07:50.442 --> 1:07:53.149
— Thank you, Daddy.
— ..typical of very strong hurricanes,

1:07:53.278 --> 1:07:56.770
generally on a line toward
the southeast Louisiana coastline.

1:07:56.907 --> 1:08:00.775
We expect it to take a turn more toward
the north in the next few hours.

1:08:00.911 --> 1:08:02.697
(J‘ Hip—hop)

1:08:08.335 --> 1:08:10.121
— Leaving, huh?
— He wants to.

1:08:10.254 --> 1:08:12.836
It's headed straight for New Orleans.
Category five.

1:08:12.965 --> 1:08:14.080
(Gasps)

1:08:14.216 --> 1:08:17.128
It'll jog, last minute, brush by. Always does.

1:08:18.136 --> 1:08:21.594
McAlarys, we don't run from hurricanes, so...

1:08:29.523 --> 1:08:31.059
Later, gents.

1:08:32.484 --> 1:08:34.566
(Davina) How many times
are we gonna do this, Del?

1:08:34.695 --> 1:08:36.310
Yeah, it does get old.

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:39.313
Y'all should have left yesterday
when you had a chance.

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:43.488
— You know how he is.
— Yeah. Stay behind to hold down the fort.

1:08:43.620 --> 1:08:46.657
- Last man standing.
— Have you seen the Weather Channel?

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:49.406
Yeah, I'm looking at it now.
The size of that thing.

1:08:49.543 --> 1:08:51.704
Big as the whole damn Gulf of Mexico.

1:08:51.837 --> 1:08:54.203
- (Board clatters)
— I'm scared, Del.

1:08:54.339 --> 1:08:55.579

1:09:00.679 --> 1:09:04.342
(LaDonna) Called it right. Should have
got the hell out yesterday morning.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:08.308
Yeah, well, we're here now. Ain't no point
worrying about what we shoulda done.

1:09:08.437 --> 1:09:12.225
(Woman on radio) ..the city, into
the Mississippi coast during the night.

1:09:12.357 --> 1:09:16.441
But as of now,
that is only some speculation by experts.

1:09:16.570 --> 1:09:19.482
— Meanwhile...
— (Car horns honking)

1:09:20.532 --> 1:09:21.988
Ooh!

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:28.236
Thought by getting off the interstate
we'd do better.

1:09:28.373 --> 1:09:31.615
— I've never seen traffic like this.
— At least there's gas to be got.

1:09:31.752 --> 1:09:34.710
— You reach David yet?
— No, Ma.

1:09:39.468 --> 1:09:41.629

1:09:41.762 --> 1:09:45.129

We're sorry, all circuits are busy.

1:09:45.265 --> 1:09:47.130
- (Beep)
— The line's busy.

1:09:47.267 --> 1:09:49.633
I'll try later.

1:10:49.079 --> 1:10:51.491
— This is eerie.
— Yeah.

1:10:51.623 --> 1:10:54.581
— Do you think we should leave too?
— In whose car?

1:10:56.878 --> 1:10:58.584
Besides, I kinda like it like this.

1:10:58.713 --> 1:11:01.295
Just you, me and the sky, baby.

1:11:02.551 --> 1:11:05.793
Look at it. It looks bruised.

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:10.596
Mm.

1:11:12.477 --> 1:11:14.468
(Annie laughs)

1:11:14.604 --> 1:11:18.347
(Man on TV) The most dangerous part of the storm is what
we call the right—front quadrant.

1:11:18.483 --> 1:11:21.975
We think that is going to be moving up here towards
Mississippi, eastern Louisiana,

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:23.693
so the effects will be felt tonight.

1:11:23.822 --> 1:11:26.063
In fact, we do have
tropical storm force winds

1:11:26.199 --> 1:11:28.485
— moving in right now.
— Fuck!

1:11:28.618 --> 1:11:31.951
The hurricane force winds could extend
as far northward as 150 miles.

1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:34.947
The damage along the coast,
we think, is gonna be catastrophic.

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:37.995
There will be a surge of perhaps 25 feet,

1:11:38.128 --> 1:11:42.337
waves as high as 30 to 40 feet
near the center.

1:11:42.466 --> 1:11:46.129
Here is the bottom line on our storm.
Extremely intense...

1:11:51.516 --> 1:11:54.974
As soon as the wrecker gets free,
they'll tow the car down to impound.

1:11:55.103 --> 1:11:58.015
Officer, that court warrant
ain't supposed to be on there anymore.

1:11:58.148 --> 1:12:01.015
- I swear. It's a mistake.
— Last thing I wanna do is take you downtown.

1:12:01.151 --> 1:12:03.312
— All hell's about to break loose.
— Then let me go.

1:12:03.445 --> 1:12:07.529
— I'll pay the damn ticket. I promise.
— Sorry. It's a bench warrant. I got no choice.

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:09.397
At least let me make a phone call, man.

1:12:09.534 --> 1:12:13.197

— What are they saying?
— Oh, what they always say.

1:12:41.608 --> 1:12:44.600
(Deep voice)
"New Orleans in the crosshairs."

1:12:44.736 --> 1:12:46.818
It really is a big one.

1:12:46.947 --> 1:12:50.405
In which case it'll blow straight up
Mr. Go's asshole

1:12:50.534 --> 1:12:54.493
and the whole fucking town will be
under 20 feet of water and toxic waste.

1:12:54.621 --> 1:12:57.237
We can all think about
where we want to live the rest of our lives.

1:12:57.374 --> 1:13:00.411
What do you think, Sof?
Cincinnati?

1:13:00.544 --> 1:13:02.455
- Daddy.
— Don't worry, sweetie.

1:13:02.587 --> 1:13:05.579
It'll swerve at the last minute
like it always does

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:08.127
and we can all go back to pretending

1:13:08.260 --> 1:13:11.878
the levees aren't actually made
out of Spanish moss and Krazy Glue.

1:13:13.223 --> 1:13:17.592
(Second woman) Let's go now back to New Orleans with
Ken Jones inside the Superdome.

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:21.561

the effects of Hurricane Katrina out here.

(Ringing tone)

1:13:22.774 --> 1:13:25.231

of Lake Pontchartrain

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:27.726
and seeing the effects
of the hurricane approaching.

1:13:27.862 --> 1:13:30.729
Right now we want to check in
with chief meteorologist Jay Grimes,

1:13:30.865 --> 1:13:32.776
who's tracking Katrina from the storm center.

1:13:32.909 --> 1:13:37.152
(Grimes) Thanks, George. Folks,
you want to stay hunkered down, stay indoors.

1:13:37.289 --> 1:13:40.952

is almost destined for the Crescent City.

Well, I'm gonna let him ride me back home.
