the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.240 --> 00:08.777
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

These are their stories.

Not the biggest, but the heaviest.

and the sundae cart.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.656

00:26.693 --> 00:27.967

loaning me Sarah for our slumber party.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.771
It's my pleasure.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.872

Dad not to pay for my trip to Italy.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.131
I'm gonna go chill at Dad's
while they're gone.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.730
How? You're still banned from there.
And besides, they changed the locks.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.839
Which is why I need to borrow your keys.

they were going to watch the Knicks

The way that they're lined
up, that's something

07:34.254 --> 07:36.666
that an institutionalized personality does.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.004
It's an attempt to exert control

All that from a few months in rehab?

No. That's the point. The person who did this

in a prison or a clinic.

Davenport killed his sister

08:23.370 --> 08:25.145
A jealous rage.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.616
This was all staged.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.092
You have to admit, it's spooky.

08:37.283 --> 08:40.559
What's spooky is the Davenport
kid disappearing into thin air.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.534
Or down the garbage chute into the dumpster

08:43.590 --> 08:45.331
which was emptied Monday morning.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.503
if he's alive, he's been on
the run for over 48 hours.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.736
Hasn't used his credit cards, bank
account, hasn't contacted anyone.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.371
All right. If he's dead, if he
was dropped down the chute,

08:57.003 --> 08:58.710
the killer would have to know
the dumpster would be emptied

08:58.772 --> 09:00.308
before the bodies upstairs were discovered.

against her nine months ago

No, no, Ma'am. Tina never hit me.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.641

I don't want any trouble.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.446

09:37.710 --> 09:40.452
That's what it said in your
complaint, before you dropped it.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.789
It was all a confusion, Ma'am. Just...

09:42.849 --> 09:44.294
GOREN: Well, okay.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.727
You're working for a nice family now, right?

09:47.187 --> 09:50.259
It takes a special person to
raise somebody else's children.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.895
Do you have your own children
back in the Philippines?

09:55.662 --> 09:58.302
Yes. A boy and a girl.
They live with my sister.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.843
You send them money every month?

10:04.471 --> 10:06.144
So when the Davenports

10:07.974 --> 10:11.114
offered you extra money
to forget about the complaint,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.657
you took it. Hmm?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.859
For your kids, right?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.832
How did Mrs. Davenport get
along with Rick and Amanda?

10:24.190 --> 10:27.637
She pretends she likes them,
and then she screams

10:27.694 --> 10:30.197
when Mr. William gives them money.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.106
Especially Mr. Rick.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.512
She didn't let him come home anymore.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.346
How do you know this?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.846
All the nannies here, they talk.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.487
Ma'am Tina says Rick
tried to kill little Lucy.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.619
I'd never hit a servant.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.559
Jinny filed that ridiculous
complaint because we fired her.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.352
She was stealing.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.431
My husband's diamond
cufflinks, his gold watch.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.025
Sounds like you could've
filed a complaint against her.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.628
Yes, well, we never actually
caught her red-handed.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.603
What? You just fired her without any proof?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.735
Was there something else?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.073
Something that she knew?
Something that she saw?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.170
Don't be sordid.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.881
She tried to hold us up for a raise.

11:12.939 --> 11:16.011
And if we didn't pay, she
threatened to have us arrested,

11:16.409 --> 11:18.912
because she was made to sleep in Lucy's room.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.656
Which could be construed as forcing
her to work around the clock.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.757
A violation of labor laws.

11:29.122 --> 11:32.569
Which is pretty smart for a country girl

11:32.959 --> 11:34.632
from the Philippines.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.871
I don't understand where
you're going with this.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.535
There's a rumor going around
about your stepson.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.942
You banned him from your home?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.780
There was a good reason for that.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.514
Rick tried to kill your daughter Lucy?

11:52.912 --> 11:55.324
I never said he tried to kill her.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.154
What exactly did he do?

11:59.652 --> 12:01.188
I was away for the weekend.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.164
Rick was staying with his father.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.867
He'd left his anxiety pills
all over the guestroom

12:07.427 --> 12:09.134
and Lucy got hold of them.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.865
If Bill hadn't found...

12:13.032 --> 12:16.445
Of course Rick denied
he even took medication.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.946
Maybe you were afraid that next
time it wouldn't be an accident.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.983
What are you talking about?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.750
We don't think Rick committed these murders.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.587
In fact, he may be a victim.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.553
Now that he and Amanda are gone,

12:32.885 --> 12:34.694
you don't have to be afraid for Lucy.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.297
You can

12:37.890 --> 12:42.134
devote all your husband's
considerable resources into

12:42.829 --> 12:44.740
safeguarding her future.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.410
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:58.811 --> 13:02.452
They found the Davenport kid at a
garbage transfer station in New Jersey.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.534
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.170
This mark, it's a belt buckle.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.139
Yeah. I was getting to that.
It's consistent with a belt buckle.

13:16.195 --> 13:19.267
The bruises overlap. The belt
was tightened more than once.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.639
Erotic asphyxiation.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.304
He was killed during sex.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.905
Which is why there was lip
balm on his genitals.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.779
Lip balm that neither of the
other victims was wearing.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.845
Did you do a tox scan?

13:30.009 --> 13:31.545
Yeah. Anything in particular?

13:31.611 --> 13:33.682
Anti-anxiety medication. Alprazolam.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.255
Negative.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.355
If he'd taken it in the last month?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.161
No, there'd be trace amounts in
his liver. Which there wasn't.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.169
And there's no record it was
ever prescribed to him.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.534
So who left the pills the little girl found?

13:48.227 --> 13:50.798
Well, we're not the only
ones being gas lighted.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.378
JINNY: I never steal anything
from Ma'am Tina. Never.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.974
She just makes me so mad.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.020
She made you sleep in Lucy's room

14:05.078 --> 14:07.115
on top of taking care of Lucy all day.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.023
Did you know that was a
violation of labor laws?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.083
Yes.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.184
And how did you know that?

14:11.250 --> 14:13.252
EAMES: One of the nannies
at the park told you?

14:13.319 --> 14:15.299
No. Mrs. Whilden's nanny.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.992
The neighbor across the hall?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.933
Her name is Hannah Price.
She's very nice to me.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.161
She helped me learn about American things.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.299
Like standing up for your rights.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.432
Yes.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.136
Was it her idea to tell the Davenports

14:27.200 --> 14:29.271
they couldn't make you sleep in Lucy's room?

14:29.635 --> 14:31.410
She told me it was not legal.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.215
She didn't tell you that you might get fired

14:36.275 --> 14:37.982
if you made trouble, did she?

14:39.412 --> 14:42.950
No, she said Ma'am Tina would just
give me more money, no problem.

14:47.153 --> 14:50.726
One more thing, did Hannah ever
talk to you about Rick Davenport?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.267
She said he was handsome.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.768
Of course Tina got rid of Jinny.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.834
She was a thief and a troublemaker.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.608
EAMES: How did your nanny react?

15:03.669 --> 15:07.082
Hannah? I'm sure she didn't
care one way or the other.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.512
Did she mention working for the Davenports?

15:10.610 --> 15:14.114
What Hannah said was, since my
daughters were getting older,

15:14.180 --> 15:16.091
she was feeling a little overwhelmed.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.023
In any event, the co-op has an understanding,

15:19.085 --> 15:22.362
we can't have nannies pitting
one family against another.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.663
I told Hannah. That was the end of it.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.705
I bet she was disappointed after
all the trouble she went to.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.839
All what trouble?

15:29.896 --> 15:31.773
Getting Jinny Canto fired

15:31.931 --> 15:34.036
so she could be closer to Rick Davenport.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.140
(LAUGHING)
Oh, come off it.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.615
No, Hannah's just not that kind
of girl. She knows her place.

15:39.672 --> 15:43.620
Especially when there was an opening
across the hall. She was just, you know...

15:44.710 --> 15:46.656
That was Hannah's way

15:46.712 --> 15:48.658
of telling me she wanted a raise.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.787
And once we settled that, she even
helped Tina find a new nanny.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.195
Sarah Eldon.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.694
Hannah knows her from the park.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.165
ABBY: Hi, Mommy.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.229
Hey, sweetie.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.970
(STAMMERING)
Go get changed.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.979
Here, let me help you.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.071
MARJORIE: Oh, she can manage.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.138
Can't you, Hannah?

16:12.205 --> 16:13.240
Yes, ma'am.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.887
You see? She knows her place.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.390
You know, I meant to ask,

16:20.446 --> 16:23.427
do you or your husband
take anti-anxiety pills?

16:25.685 --> 16:28.131
In the first place, I am divorced.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.997
And in the second, that
is none of your business.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.926
Sounds like a yes on the pills.

16:37.396 --> 16:40.104
SARAH: She treats him so bad.
She's such a meanie.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.612
HANNAH: She doesn't deserve
him. None of them do.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.874
Did he ask about me?

16:43.936 --> 16:46.473
I don't think so. Lucy, don't
go down there, okay?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.712
Never mind Lucy. Did he ask about me?

16:48.774 --> 16:49.980
Ouch.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.887
Every day, Hannah.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.921
You can see how much he cares.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.394
And what else? Tell me.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.552
And he's going to Paris next month.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.589
I think he might ask us to go.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.691
I knew it! Oh, God!

17:03.756 --> 17:04.894
(shrieking)

17:04.957 --> 17:05.958
(CAR HORN HONKING)

17:06.025 --> 17:07.367
BILL: Sarah, let's go.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.702
Lucy, Daddy's here.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.548
Hey, kiddo. How you doing?

17:21.440 --> 17:22.976
Mr. Davenport,

17:23.041 --> 17:25.818
I'm really sorry about Rick and Amanda.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.902
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGING)

17:43.729 --> 17:44.867
Hi.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.342
Mrs. Whilden isn't in.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.208
Right. We've been ringing the bell.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.372
The doorman thought that she was home.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.375
Hey, is it okay if we, you know, wait inside?

17:59.111 --> 18:02.217
She said she was having lunch
with some of her lady friends.

18:02.448 --> 18:03.825
Lunch.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.426
I almost forgot about lunch.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.226
Is that your tummy I hear growling?

18:11.591 --> 18:12.899
Mmm-hmm.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.430
I'll get you lunch in a minute, sweetie.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.573
Are we keeping you from something?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.375
Mrs. Whilden asked me to tape
a show for her on TV.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.212
Oh, hey, go ahead. We'll get lunch started.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.084
There's some tofu bologna
on the bottom shelf.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.982
How about veggies? Do you like veggies?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.523
All right.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.488
Let's see what we have.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.732
Corn nibblets. You want
to nibble on some nibblets?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.029
Yes.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.299
All right. This is gonna
be an excellent lunch.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.536
Mrs. Whilden told us

18:55.134 --> 18:58.707
that you helped your friend Sarah
get a job with the Davenports.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.343
Just lucky I knew someone.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.248
And lucky there was a job opening.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.854
You met Sarah at the park?

19:09.015 --> 19:10.426
HANNAH: That's right.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.555
Isn't that a risk, recommending
somebody you just met?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.930
Sometimes you just get
a good feeling about people.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.164
Well, Sarah's a very sweet girl.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.466
The Davenports are very lucky to have her.

19:24.830 --> 19:28.141
(STAMMERING) Especially at a
time like this, huh? Oops.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.272
I'm sorry, I made a mess.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.813
It's no bother.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.821
EAMES: One thing about Sarah, she's very shy.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.621
Yeah, she's not very sophisticated.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.683
Did you notice that?

19:43.749 --> 19:44.784
Mmm.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.361
Well, she's from a small town.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.723
(STAMMERING)
Oh, that's what we thought.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.559
Where? Upstate?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.734
I don't know.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
She never talks about where she's from?

19:57.697 --> 19:58.971
Uh...

20:00.332 --> 20:02.039
Well, I just don't remember the name of it.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.547
What else do you guys talk about?

20:07.606 --> 20:09.517
You tell stories about your bosses?

20:09.575 --> 20:10.576
No.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.880
Oh, come on, I bet you have some juicy ones.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.084
EAMES: Especially about Rick Davenport.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.353
We have other things to talk about.

20:18.484 --> 20:21.090
I saw a picture of him. He was handsome.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.561
I'm sorry, I have work to get on with.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.364
I have to change Abby

20:26.425 --> 20:28.928
and redd up her room before Mrs.
Whilden comes home.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.002
You're from Pennsylvania.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.672
No, because you just said you
need to "redd up" her room.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.613
That's what people say

20:40.206 --> 20:42.015
in Western Pennsylvania.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.811
I don't know. I'm from somewhere else.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.224
I think I just heard the videotape go off.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.489
Well, I better check it.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.926
Our virtual tour of Western Pennsylvania

21:25.985 --> 21:28.898
turned up a five-year-old arrest
for Hannah Price in Meadville.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.934
It's a juvenile record, it's sealed.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.869
Could be for shoplifting. It's meaningless.

21:33.926 --> 21:37.772
The meaning is, there's a residential
treatment center for children in Meadville.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.272
Where she was institutionalized?

21:41.100 --> 21:43.011
Probably. Her records are sealed.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.809
I can't help you unseal them.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.816
All you have is peas and corn kernels.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.245
You're a few lima beans short
of succotash, Detectives.

21:51.343 --> 21:52.583
Succotash?

21:52.778 --> 21:54.587
Your evidence is anecdotal.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.420
I line up my shoes at night.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.525
Why am I not surprised?

21:59.118 --> 22:02.656
Idiosyncrasies won't sway the
Pennsylvania attorney general.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.229
I can't even explain to him why these
girls committed these murders.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.397
The answers are in those records.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.201
You'll have to find another way.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.243
The rules on privacy are pretty clear.

22:18.304 --> 22:19.806
We're kind of at a dead end.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.284
See, my kid brother got
engaged to this girl...

22:22.341 --> 22:24.343
Her brother isn't the
best judge of character.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.084
This girl had been very
sketchy about her past.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.148
You know for a fact she was a resident here?

22:29.215 --> 22:30.819
She had this box of letters

22:30.883 --> 22:32.760
and some of them were addressed to her here.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.855
We didn't read the letters, of course.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.365
Why don't you just ask her?

22:36.422 --> 22:37.457
No.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.797
Her brother wouldn't like that.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.073
We need to know why Hannah was living here.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.731
Hannah.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.270
Hannah Price.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.842
Hannah lost her mother when she was six.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.579
Her father was unable to care
for her, so she lived here.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.643
EAMES: For how long?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.018
Till she was 16.

22:59.278 --> 23:00.723
Don't kids

23:00.779 --> 23:03.225
go to foster homes, normally?

23:04.149 --> 23:06.095
Yes, normally...

23:08.220 --> 23:11.463
Look, if something's wrong with
her and somebody gets hurt...

23:12.958 --> 23:15.632
All I can tell you is that
I just remember Hannah

23:15.694 --> 23:18.573
as a bright little girl who
loved having her ears tickled.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.936
Is that both ears together?

23:23.335 --> 23:25.576
Yeah. It was something her mother used to do.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.012
A family thing.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.785
Didn't your brother say
that Hannah had a sister?

23:34.847 --> 23:36.292
Oh...

23:36.916 --> 23:38.827
Sandra. Sarah.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.657
Sarah.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.729
She had a different last name.

23:45.457 --> 23:46.697
Eldon.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.263
Now, is that because she was adopted?

23:50.562 --> 23:51.768
Yes.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.537
By a family in the area?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.044
(LAUGHING)
Sarah just loved it.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.511
And it always had to be
both ears at the same time.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.848
Something her mother did
when Sarah was little.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.353
What happened to the mother?

24:05.811 --> 24:07.518
Lori died in prison

24:08.213 --> 24:09.658
of AIDS.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.922
And the father?

24:13.652 --> 24:15.996
He ran out on them after Sarah was born.

24:16.522 --> 24:19.093
You did say Sarah was okay.
She's not in any trouble?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.934
She's fine. It's Hannah
we're interested in.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.032
GOREN: You're not surprised.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.976
She's had a difficult life
growing up with no family.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.675
We're curious about that.
Don't they try to have

24:31.737 --> 24:33.478
siblings adopted together?

24:34.406 --> 24:36.249
That was our idea at first.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.680
But Hannah was a handful.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.651
She was always breaking things.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.624
She'd lied about everything.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.028
She was distant?

24:45.918 --> 24:48.592
You'd try to give her
affection and she'd pull back.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.398
We tried so hard.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.167
But they told us she was
pretty much a done deal.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.142
She probably didn't want to be adopted.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.171
MR. ELDON: That's what she said.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.908
She had this notion that one day her
father was gonna come back for her.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.048
She told the caseworkers she
didn't care if they were split up.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.849
She wanted Sarah to have a family.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.817
She cared about her little sister.

25:13.879 --> 25:14.914
Yes.

25:16.081 --> 25:17.822
When Sarah told us

25:17.883 --> 25:21.729
that Hannah had found her a job in New
York City, we weren't so worried.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.661
Have you talked to her since?

25:25.924 --> 25:27.665
Not for a while.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.670
But she did send George
a card on his birthday.

25:33.599 --> 25:34.805
Could we see it?

25:43.909 --> 25:48.051
"Dear Daddy, happy birthday from the
Big Apple. I miss you both so much.

25:48.113 --> 25:51.151
"Oh, Mommy, can you believe
Madelyn's baby is Lance's?"

25:51.216 --> 25:52.661
Who are Madelyn and Lance?

25:52.818 --> 25:56.459
(CHUCKLING) That's just our soap
opera. We used to watch it together.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.861
"Daddy, I'm kind of on a tight budget,

25:59.925 --> 26:02.531
"but I want you to have these.
They were my father's.

26:02.594 --> 26:05.768
"You were there when he wasn't
and I want you to have them."

26:07.733 --> 26:09.337
What did she give you?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.110
Cufflinks.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.475
Diamond cufflinks.

26:20.012 --> 26:23.084
She won't ever go back to him,
even if he gets his memory back.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.587
But when she thought he was dead,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.288
(DOOR OPENING)
she said she'd always love him.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.262
You are so naive.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.761
Where's Lucy?

26:31.290 --> 26:32.997
Hannah told me she was with you.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.046
We already looked through Sarah's room.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.709
MARJORIE: Well, I can assure you

26:47.773 --> 26:50.515
that I look through Hannah's
room on a regular basis

26:50.576 --> 26:53.147
and I have never found anything wrong.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.659
EAMES: Stupid us, going to the
trouble to get search warrants.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.140
In the Shadow of Tomorrow.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.542
That's a soap opera that she tapes.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.983
It's a little low-brow, but hardly criminal.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.748
Guess you didn't look in here.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.413
"W.S.D."

27:28.046 --> 27:29.684
William Davenport.

27:34.686 --> 27:36.324
Every night I went to sleep

27:36.388 --> 27:39.096
dreaming of the day my real
father would come for me.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.804
And the man I dreamed about
looked exactly like you.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.435
What is this?

27:45.731 --> 27:48.109
In the Shadow of Tomorrow, airdate June 5,

27:48.167 --> 27:49.805
1997.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.639
This lovely couple in bed over here.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.308
That's Lance and Keri.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.375
Keri was "Miss Shadow Valley 1996."

27:56.441 --> 27:58.114
And she's wearing a scarf around her neck

27:58.177 --> 28:00.748
because they're experimenting
in erotic asphyxia.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.058
March 1998.

28:04.116 --> 28:08.087
Angela's 2-year-old daughter went into a coma

28:09.154 --> 28:11.896
when she accidentally
ate Angela's tranquilizers.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.235
And this one.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.602
November of last year.

28:20.632 --> 28:24.239
It's Eden Montgomery and her
stepfather on the eve of her wedding.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.444
They belonged to my father.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.720
You were there for me when he wasn't,

28:31.543 --> 28:34.114
and I want you to have them, Daddy.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.485
Let me guess, cufflinks.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.054
This soap opera for these girls,

28:41.353 --> 28:42.696
this is their playbook.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.893
Their whole life is a play.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.000
This is real.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.507
I had no idea. I mean...

29:01.506 --> 29:04.009
In hindsight it makes sense. Hannah always

29:06.144 --> 29:07.987
made a special effort

29:08.480 --> 29:09.982
to make me notice her.

29:12.217 --> 29:15.687
Rick or Amanda ever let on they
knew about this fixation on you?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.226
BILL: No, of course they didn't know. They...

29:18.790 --> 29:21.964
No hint your son was having
sex with Hannah that night?

29:22.027 --> 29:24.598
No. I told you, he said they were going to

29:25.497 --> 29:28.341
watch basketball and
play some computer games.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.946
What computer games? Do you remember?

29:34.039 --> 29:36.280
Because we didn't find any games.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.013
He called it

29:42.180 --> 29:43.921
Shadow something. Shadow...

29:43.982 --> 29:45.256
Shadow Valley?

29:46.318 --> 29:47.797
Yes. Shadow Valley.

29:49.554 --> 29:50.760
What?

29:50.822 --> 29:53.530
Shadow Valley is the place
where the soap opera was set.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.799
The fact that your son knew
about the girls' fantasy

29:55.861 --> 29:57.738
might have triggered the murders.

29:59.865 --> 30:03.176
I can't believe we allowed
these monsters into our home.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.706
What I'm interested in,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.681
is how these monsters

30:08.307 --> 30:09.547
interacted.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.383
It was clear who was the boss.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.553
Hannah.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.760
GOREN: How could you tell?

30:18.550 --> 30:21.861
Bill and I gave Sarah a cashmere
sweater for her birthday.

30:22.587 --> 30:25.534
She was practically in tears,
she was so appreciative.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.429
She wore the sweater all weekend long,
and then she never wore it again.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.669
Hannah took it.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.334
I saw her wearing it.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.308
BILL: We took Lucy to her
grandmother's this morning,

30:38.370 --> 30:40.077
after you called us.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.013
We need to get back to her.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.419
Mr. Davenport,

30:46.645 --> 30:49.057
we may need your help later on today.

30:56.755 --> 30:59.827
Who's the worst pro bono lawyer you know?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.301
The worst? That's easy.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.971
Stan Shatenstein.

31:05.731 --> 31:08.473
You know, hypothetically, how would we get

31:09.267 --> 31:12.305
Stan Shatenstein assigned to two defendants?

31:13.405 --> 31:14.816
What would we do?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.319
What would you do, hypothetically?

31:18.744 --> 31:20.849
Since Mr. Shatenstein covers night court,

31:20.912 --> 31:24.485
you'd make sure your defendants
were arrested after 7:00 p.m.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.460
Well, murder one.

31:31.156 --> 31:33.261
So the death penalty's on the table here?

31:33.325 --> 31:35.134
Yes, it is, Mr. Shatenstein.

31:38.363 --> 31:40.070
What's your thinking here?

31:40.866 --> 31:44.313
We're thinking this one was taking
orders from her big sister.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.041
Oh, yeah?

31:49.641 --> 31:50.881
Sarah,

31:51.343 --> 31:54.688
we know you and Hannah killed
those people. We know it for a fact.

31:55.113 --> 31:58.117
We're offering you the chance
to save not only your own life,

31:58.283 --> 32:00.126
but your sister's as well.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.233
We didn't hurt anyone. We didn't.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.293
There's something else

32:08.093 --> 32:09.401
that we know.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.099
We know why you did it.

32:19.204 --> 32:23.016
That Rick found out something
that he wasn't supposed to.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.213
Something about Hannah.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.727
And then he used that knowledge to
force Hannah to have sex with him

32:33.852 --> 32:35.854
and to have sex with his buddy Josh.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.265
EAMES: Don't bother denying it.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.628
Here's another thing we know for a fact.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.634
Hannah stole these things
from the Davenports.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.942
That's what Rick found out.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.038
That Hannah was a thief.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.881
That's what he had on her

32:57.576 --> 33:00.420
and he threatened to call the police, right?

33:03.281 --> 33:06.854
Sarah, we talked to
the Eldon's in Pennsylvania.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.864
We know you're a good person.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.763
And the Davenports,

33:11.823 --> 33:14.497
they think the world of you.
They want to help you.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.206
EAMES: We told them
whatever you did that night,

33:18.396 --> 33:20.535
it was because Hannah made you do it.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.270
GOREN: You're nothing like her at all.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.280
You have people who raised you.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.847
Who love you.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.091
But Hannah...

33:35.347 --> 33:36.849
I mean, she's...

33:37.949 --> 33:40.225
She's like a paper cup in the breeze.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.856
She's not like that. You don't even know her.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.091
It's okay if you feel sorry
for her. It's okay.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.199
But right now you have to think of yourself.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.537
You have to think of yourself.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.201
I don't know anything.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.308
(SOBBING)
I don't know anything.

34:04.910 --> 34:08.447
Well, when you're ready to talk to
us, give Mr. Shatenstein a call.

34:12.183 --> 34:15.391
EAMES: The DA said he'd be sending
you the SVDF by tomorrow morning.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.364
Okay. What's that?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.895
It's a special form for capital cases.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.096
You haven't done a lot of
capital cases, have you?

34:24.462 --> 34:26.168
(STAMMERING)

34:34.940 --> 34:37.011
I don't think he knows what he's doing.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.623
What did you say to those cops?

34:42.746 --> 34:44.726
Nothing, Hannah. I would never.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.331
Do they know?

34:54.292 --> 34:57.239
About that? No, they don't know about that.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.238
I thought they did, but they don't.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.680
They wanted me to say
that you were the bad one.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.916
Because I got adopted and you didn't.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.475
But I didn't say that, Hannah. I swear.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.815
(SOBBING)
What's gonna happen to us?

35:16.581 --> 35:18.652
What's gonna happen to us, Hannah?

35:26.725 --> 35:28.568
Remember when Eden

35:28.627 --> 35:31.130
was in that prison in South America?

35:31.630 --> 35:33.803
How she was saved in the nick of time?

35:36.635 --> 35:38.546
We don't have anything to worry about.

35:39.337 --> 35:42.648
We just stick together, like always.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.860
COURT CLERK: "Case number 163-3202.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.402
"People v. Hannah Price and Sarah Eldon,

36:00.458 --> 36:02.768
"murder in the first degree, 3 counts."

36:02.827 --> 36:06.434
Your honor, if I may. I'm Elizabeth
Carr from Eddington and Taft.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.876
I've been retained on
behalf of the defendant.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.509
PALLADINO: Are you here for both?

36:11.569 --> 36:13.173
No, just Sarah Eldon.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.713
Fine. Mr. Shatenstein, you're relieved
from representing Miss Eldon.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.817
You'll be Miss Price's attorney.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.426
How does your client plead, Ms. Carr?

36:23.615 --> 36:25.060
(WHISPERING)
Not guilty.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.493
Not guilty.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.428
And your client, Mr. Shatenstein?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.321
(WHISPERING)
Not guilty.

36:30.388 --> 36:31.458
Not guilty.

36:31.556 --> 36:35.766
Your honor, at this time, I'm serving
the people with a motion to sever.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.842
Have you anything to say about
this here, Mr. Shatenstein?

36:40.165 --> 36:43.237
Uh, nothing right now, Judge.

36:43.735 --> 36:44.907
All right.

36:45.403 --> 36:46.643
People on bail?

36:46.705 --> 36:49.117
No bail, Your Honor. The defendants have

36:49.174 --> 36:52.314
no jobs, no home, no ties to the community.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.915
Your honor, Miss Eldon is employed
by Mr. William Davenport,

36:55.980 --> 36:57.755
the father of two of the victims.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.625
It's Mr. Davenport who retained me

36:59.684 --> 37:02.290
to represent her because he
believes in her innocence.

37:02.353 --> 37:05.960
He's prepared to post any amount
of bail to ensure her appearance.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.764
I hope be brought his checkbook.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.703
Bail is set at $2 million.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.874
My client also has significant
ties to the community.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.569
She has no reason to flee.

37:14.632 --> 37:18.341
No reason to flee? She's
facing the death penalty.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.777
Palladino: With all due respect
to Mr. Shatenstein,

37:20.839 --> 37:23.080
bail as to defendant Price is denied.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.484
(GAVEL POUNDING)

37:28.313 --> 37:29.587
Wait!

37:30.648 --> 37:31.991
HANNAH: Wait!

37:32.350 --> 37:34.057
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on!

37:34.119 --> 37:36.258
I have to stay with my sister!

37:36.755 --> 37:38.325
- GUARD: Come on, now.
- Wait!

37:38.389 --> 37:41.336
What are you doing?
Get off of me!

37:49.434 --> 37:50.777
(DOOR BUZZING)

38:00.111 --> 38:03.058
Don't worry about Sarah.
She's in good hands.

38:05.016 --> 38:08.429
That lawyer she's got there is pretty sharp.

38:10.255 --> 38:12.132
Hey, Mr. Shatenstein

38:12.323 --> 38:15.167
explain to you what happened
back there in the courtroom?

38:15.360 --> 38:16.896
The motion to sever?

38:17.796 --> 38:19.070
No.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.168
What does that mean?

38:21.232 --> 38:23.872
It means that you and Sarah
are gonna be tried separately.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.679
That'll be easier

38:29.808 --> 38:31.378
for Sarah's lawyer

38:31.843 --> 38:33.584
to, you know, blame you for the murders.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.622
Sarah would never do that to me.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.324
Maybe not.

38:42.353 --> 38:44.492
What I'm trying to say
is, that at some point,

38:44.556 --> 38:48.436
Sarah is just gonna have to do
what her lawyer tells her to do.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.714
Is that what happened with the adoptions?

39:01.039 --> 39:02.950
Because it never really made sense to us.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.748
Adoption agencies,

39:04.843 --> 39:07.050
they keep siblings together.

39:10.815 --> 39:12.385
I didn't want to be adopted.

39:12.817 --> 39:16.526
You stayed behind in that warehouse for kids

39:18.323 --> 39:19.700
because you wanted

39:20.291 --> 39:22.601
your little sister to have a better life.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.206
Does she know what you did for her?

39:27.465 --> 39:30.537
Does she know how lucky she is to
have you watching out for her?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.672
Mmm-hmm.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.846
We're lucky to have each other.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.653
Well, right now she's the lucky one.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.750
GOREN: With Bill Davenport.

39:56.461 --> 39:57.565
Here.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.254
Well, look at the way he behaves towards her.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.421
You know, the way he tells her things.

40:22.553 --> 40:23.861
He's very...

40:25.156 --> 40:27.227
He's very fatherly.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.540
Well, it must be fate
how their paths crossed.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.806
I got her that job.

40:36.868 --> 40:37.903
I know.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.849
You know, it's really unfair.

40:41.539 --> 40:44.247
Considering that you're the
one that did all the work

40:45.009 --> 40:46.488
to get close to him.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.694
When you first saw him, Hannah,

41:00.191 --> 41:03.297
did he look like the man
that you dreamed about

41:03.361 --> 41:06.171
when you dreamed about your
real father coming for you?

41:06.230 --> 41:07.368
What did you say to me?

41:07.432 --> 41:08.433
That's what Sarah told us.

41:08.499 --> 41:09.842
No, she didn't!

41:09.901 --> 41:11.175
Yes. She told us all about you...

41:11.235 --> 41:12.908
You are lying!

41:13.438 --> 41:14.883
There they go.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.387
GOREN: She's going home.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.825
Next time you see her
it'll be in the courtroom

41:23.881 --> 41:25.121
when she testifies against you.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.387
No!

41:26.651 --> 41:28.653
That'll be the last time,
because Bill Davenport

41:28.720 --> 41:30.529
won't allow her to see you in jail.

41:31.589 --> 41:33.967
Sarah will take the place
of his dead daughter.

41:35.293 --> 41:36.863
She's gonna become

41:37.395 --> 41:39.170
Lucy's big sister.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.475
It'll be like you never existed.

41:46.537 --> 41:47.914
No! Sarah!

41:50.775 --> 41:51.981
Sarah!

41:54.278 --> 41:55.552
Sarah!

42:03.588 --> 42:05.261
They were pigs!

42:06.357 --> 42:08.132
They laughed at us!

42:10.161 --> 42:12.300
HANNAH: I'll tell you everything!

42:14.165 --> 42:17.237
She helped me kill Rick in the bed.

42:17.301 --> 42:18.712
She helped me.

42:19.337 --> 42:21.681
And Amanda, it was her idea to call Amanda.

42:21.773 --> 42:23.946
She knew her number. I didn't!

42:24.008 --> 42:25.544
She killed Amanda!

42:27.945 --> 42:30.084
Sarah! Sarah!

42:30.715 --> 42:33.662
Sarah! I want my sister!

42:33.718 --> 42:35.391
I want Sarah!

42:51.102 --> 42:52.274
Well,

42:52.970 --> 42:55.814
our little ploy worked.
She gave up her sister.

42:57.442 --> 42:58.853
Gave up. Yes,

42:59.677 --> 43:01.020
and no.
