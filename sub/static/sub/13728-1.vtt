01:35.975 --> 01:37.220
Oh hey, Uncle Tommy.

01:37.366 --> 01:38.540
Hey.

04:46.251 --> 04:49.857
During the last week of summer,
we were downtown... one fine day.

04:50.078 --> 04:53.102
One day, I was with Jared,
who's a little older than me.

04:53.313 --> 04:55.294
He said we should check out
Paranoid Park.

04:55.436 --> 04:56.610
I had heard of it, of course...

04:56.758 --> 04:59.012
But I'd never thought of going there.

04:59.159 --> 05:00.748
I assumed it was out of my league.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.256
But when I said,
"I don't think I'm ready..."

05:03.403 --> 05:05.348
...Jared laughed
and said something like,

05:05.491 --> 05:07.567
"Nobody's ever ready
for Paranoid Park."

05:08.204 --> 05:10.777
We went to the park together
the next day.

06:57.694 --> 07:01.027
Dude, this place is tight.
We should hit it up on Saturday.

07:01.799 --> 07:04.372
About a month later,
halfway through math class,

07:04.513 --> 07:08.712
there was an announcement. My name.
My name, and no others.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.895
OK, so today I really really want to
teach you guys about buoyant force,

07:13.037 --> 07:16.964
and... buoyant force is the force
that's exerted upon an object...

07:17.108 --> 07:21.758
um, but... The funny thing is objects
tend to uh... differ... in shape...

07:21.909 --> 07:23.569
Will Alex Tremain report
to the front office.

07:23.718 --> 07:25.070
Alex Tremain to the front office.

07:25.214 --> 07:26.708
We have objects like this,
like you see,

07:26.849 --> 07:28.652
divided in the middle...

07:28.798 --> 07:30.945
But an object can also... Oh.

07:37.983 --> 07:39.442
OK, sorry about that...

08:23.768 --> 08:25.571
Hey there, Alex. Come have a seat.

08:28.083 --> 08:28.842
Hey.

08:30.414 --> 08:32.181
Sorry I pulled you out of class.

08:32.605 --> 08:33.815
Uh, that's all right.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.525
So... Anyway,
I talked to your friend Jared.

08:39.669 --> 08:42.029
He says you almost went
by the Eastside Skateboard Park

08:42.173 --> 08:44.747
on the night of the seventeenth.
Is that right?

08:44.887 --> 08:45.753
Yeah.

08:46.105 --> 08:48.466
OK, did you drive around out
that night or...?

08:48.610 --> 08:49.120
Did I what?

08:49.271 --> 08:50.860
Did you drive around that night?

08:51.220 --> 08:53.438
Um... yeah...

08:53.586 --> 08:57.714
OK.
Did you drive... by there that night?

08:57.865 --> 08:58.766
The park itself.

08:58.909 --> 08:59.917
No.

09:00.091 --> 09:01.336
Where did you go?

09:01.483 --> 09:05.516
That night, I drove around downtown,
and got something to eat,

09:05.658 --> 09:07.983
parked down near the waterfront
and then walked around.

09:08.128 --> 09:09.753
OK. Were you skateboarding?

09:09.902 --> 09:13.829
Yeah. Well, no.
I had my skateboard but...

09:13.973 --> 09:16.298
I'm not that good
so I try to practice by myself.

09:16.443 --> 09:20.441
OK. And... so you can give me times
for these things,

09:20.584 --> 09:22.565
right, I mean approximately?

09:22.705 --> 09:26.560
Yeah. Um, I went to Jared's around
seven or eight...

09:26.707 --> 09:29.697
and then I dropped him off
at the bus station shortly after that.

09:29.839 --> 09:31.641
And then drove around...

09:32.030 --> 09:34.604
Oh yeah, that's something I got confused
about before 'cause...

09:34.744 --> 09:38.005
I didn't go back to my house,
I went back to Jared's 'cause...

09:38.153 --> 09:40.858
Jared and I planned to stay at his house
that night... originally.

09:41.006 --> 09:43.995
OK, that's fine.
So, where was his parents?

09:44.137 --> 09:48.444
His mom was... in Las Vegas and...
his dad doesn't live with them.

09:48.591 --> 09:49.800
OK, so no brothers or sisters,

09:49.948 --> 09:51.929
so the house was totally empty then,
right?

09:52.070 --> 09:53.101
Yeah.

09:53.253 --> 09:54.047
Did your parents know this?

09:54.192 --> 09:56.790
I mean that...
nobody was home at Jared's?

09:56.941 --> 09:59.194
Uh, it's not like
they cared or anything.

09:59.342 --> 10:03.232
OK... Uh well no, that's... that's fine,

10:03.377 --> 10:05.394
I mean... it's probably
that old trick where...

10:05.535 --> 10:08.346
you tell your parents you're gonna
spend the night at Jared's house and...

10:08.492 --> 10:11.612
your parents don't realize
that his parents aren't home and...

10:11.762 --> 10:14.087
basically you get to do
whatever you want.

10:14.232 --> 10:16.213
Pretty much, I m...
it's not like my mom cares.

10:16.355 --> 10:19.724
No, that's fine, I used to do that.
I mean that's an old one. No big deal.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.663
Yeah.

10:20.808 --> 10:22.505
What is your parental situation?

10:22.652 --> 10:23.446
What do you mean?

10:23.591 --> 10:25.845
Well, your parents.
Are they... still together?

10:25.992 --> 10:27.936
They've been separated
for a while and they're...

10:28.079 --> 10:29.811
gonna get a divorce soon.

10:29.958 --> 10:32.247
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, my parents got a divorce.

10:32.394 --> 10:35.099
I mean... in fact I think
I was about your age.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.323
I know it's kind of a tough thing to...
go through...

10:37.473 --> 10:38.541
Yeah...

10:38.691 --> 10:41.537
Uh... do you have any...
brothers or sisters?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.281
Yeah. I have a little brother,
and he's thirteen.

10:44.432 --> 10:45.463
OK, how 'bout a sister?

10:45.614 --> 10:46.824
No.

10:47.006 --> 10:48.880
Uh... how 'bout a girlfriend?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.756
Yeah... Jennifer.

10:50.903 --> 10:52.706
Jennifer? And where was she that night?

10:52.851 --> 10:53.716
- My girlfriend?
- Uh huh.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.327
She was with... just some other friends.

10:56.470 --> 10:58.273
OK. Did you happen to call her
that night at any point?

10:58.418 --> 10:59.698
I mean, do you have a cell phone?

10:59.844 --> 11:02.418
No, I didn't call her and,
I don't have a cell phone.

11:02.558 --> 11:07.529
OK. Uh... well...
Just goin' through my notes,

11:07.673 --> 11:12.845
I'll tell you what... uh...
Let me tell you what my situation is...

11:12.996 --> 11:14.348
I have this security guard...

11:14.492 --> 11:17.718
and we find him deceased
on the railroad tracks.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.997
And so we're thinking maybe he tripped,
or he fell.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.093
But, the autopsy says he was struck
by an object.

11:25.555 --> 11:28.437
And... we also have a witness
that says...

11:28.582 --> 11:31.702
he saw somebody throw something over
the bridge into the river.

11:31.852 --> 11:35.008
We happen to have that object
and it's a skateboard.

11:35.158 --> 11:38.313
Now the funny thing is there's
some DNA evidence on the skateboard,

11:38.463 --> 11:40.610
that puts it at the scene of the crime.

11:46.396 --> 11:47.570
Where did you go?

11:47.718 --> 11:52.831
I... drove around, downtown a little
to Subway and got something to eat.

11:52.971 --> 11:54.739
OK, there's about a thousand
and two Subways.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.688
- Which one did you go to?
- By the waterfront.

11:56.834 --> 12:00.309
OK, and the one... over in the,
World Trade Center? That one?

12:00.452 --> 12:01.033
Yes.

12:01.183 --> 12:02.535
OK. What'd you get?

12:02.678 --> 12:06.676
Turkey and ham on... Italian herb
and cheese bread, toasted...

12:06.818 --> 12:10.532
tomato lettuce pickle olive mustard oil
and vinegar...

12:10.681 --> 12:11.617
Did you get mayo?

12:11.759 --> 12:12.174
No.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.075
Gotta have mayo with that.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.121
Mayo's sick.

12:14.263 --> 12:15.793
Mayo's sick. What kind of bread was it?

12:15.934 --> 12:17.428
Italian herb and cheese.

12:17.569 --> 12:18.637
OK, you have a receipt
in your pocket for that?

12:18.787 --> 12:20.898
No, I don't keep... Subway receipts.

12:21.048 --> 12:21.878
OK, how much did it cost then?

12:22.022 --> 12:24.311
Like... six something,
Subway's expensive.

12:24.458 --> 12:25.561
Six-inch twelve-inch?

12:25.710 --> 12:26.220
Six.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.687
Six-inch, for six bucks,

12:27.832 --> 12:29.077
so you must have got the meal,
then, right?

12:29.224 --> 12:30.398
No, I just got a drink.

12:30.546 --> 12:31.305
OK, all right...

12:31.451 --> 12:32.352
Large, Dr. Pepper.

12:32.495 --> 12:33.147
Who'd you eat with?

12:33.295 --> 12:36.593
Myself. I drove by myself, so...

12:36.843 --> 12:42.335
OK... You know I gotta cut
this short... um...

12:42.550 --> 12:44.009
Let me give you my business card.

12:45.542 --> 12:49.468
If you have anything to add...
I want you to give me a call all right?

12:51.421 --> 12:52.702
- OK.
- You do that?

12:54.414 --> 12:55.766
So, can I go back to class?

12:55.909 --> 12:58.483
Yeah, you can. Thanks. Appreciate it.

13:07.252 --> 13:08.876
I'm writing this a little out of order.

13:09.618 --> 13:13.129
Sorry, I didn't do so well,
in creative writing.

13:13.270 --> 13:17.268
But... I'll get it all on paper,
eventually.

15:26.349 --> 15:27.286
What are you writing?

15:27.776 --> 15:29.649
Oh nothin', just homework.

15:30.733 --> 15:31.978
Good day for it.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.746
Anyway, after Jared had mentioned
Paranoid Park,

16:11.892 --> 16:14.846
that first time,
we ended up going the next day.

16:59.035 --> 17:02.439
It wasn't the night the police detective
was talking about, though.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.845
But it was my first time there,
and I liked it right away.

17:07.244 --> 17:11.064
One appeal of a place like Paranoid
was the kids that skated there.

17:11.246 --> 17:14.685
They had built the park illegally all
by themselves.

17:15.074 --> 17:20.151
Trainhoppers... guitar punks...
skate... drunks...

17:20.291 --> 17:24.112
throwaway kids...
No matter how bad your family life was,

17:24.258 --> 17:26.334
these guys had it much worse.

18:04.964 --> 18:08.226
Dude this place is tight.
We should hit it up on Saturday.

18:08.374 --> 18:09.512
That sounds like fun.

18:10.218 --> 18:14.287
The first problem with Jared's
plan was Jennifer... my girlfriend.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.160
Yeah but like, you, I don't know,

18:16.307 --> 18:18.251
you like hanging out with him better
than me it seems sometimes

18:18.394 --> 18:19.260
and it's kind of annoying.

18:19.404 --> 18:21.906
She wanted me to hang out
with her that night.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.051
Don't... no. No, you cannot... no.
You can't do that.

18:27.197 --> 18:30.601
You can't call my friends,
like... it's... no.

18:30.745 --> 18:34.635
Jennifer was nice and everything...
but... she was a virgin.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.276
Which meant she'd want to do it...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.875
...at some point.

18:38.191 --> 18:40.729
And then I knew things
would get all serious.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.339
I told my mom I was spending
Saturday night at Jared's

18:43.479 --> 18:47.334
so we could go to the winter sports
expo earlier on Sunday.

18:47.481 --> 18:49.354
Then I asked to borrow her car.

18:49.707 --> 18:51.818
And follow the rules of the road,
mister!

18:51.968 --> 18:52.763
I will.

18:52.908 --> 18:53.632
All right.

19:40.989 --> 19:42.970
Hi, welcome to Burgerville.
You can order when you're ready.

19:43.704 --> 19:52.992
Uh... I'll have two cheeseburgers...
and... a chocolate shake.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.171
Alex, I know you're bummed and all.

20:29.316 --> 20:32.577
But this trip to Corvalis,
is gonna be like a sure thing for me.

20:32.725 --> 20:35.679
Dude but that's weak,
you'd ditch Paranoid for some girl.

20:35.891 --> 20:38.702
Especially when she was denying you
the whole summer.

20:38.848 --> 20:42.881
Yeah but dude...
I'm gonna get so laid this time.

20:43.093 --> 20:44.409
And you should call Jennifer, I mean,

20:44.554 --> 20:47.614
what are you waiting for with her?
What do you want?

20:49.390 --> 20:50.849
What I really wanted was to go skate

20:50.991 --> 20:53.588
with the hardcore freaks
at Paranoid Park.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.277
All right, dude,
you can crash at my place.

20:57.427 --> 21:00.903
Play video games. Call Jennifer.
Then we'll both get laid.

21:04.908 --> 21:07.090
I didn't want someone
to damage my mom's car,

21:07.238 --> 21:08.898
so I parked on the other side
of the river,

21:09.047 --> 21:10.707
which was a safer bet.

21:37.194 --> 21:37.881
Hey, kid.

21:38.029 --> 21:38.480
Hey.

21:38.621 --> 21:39.795
Your mom know you're here?

21:39.943 --> 21:40.702
Yeah.

21:40.848 --> 21:42.022
Is she hot?

21:42.343 --> 21:43.244
Dude, I don't know.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.047
You should bring her by.

22:22.110 --> 22:23.046
Paranoid was great.

22:23.189 --> 22:25.550
I could have sat there all night
watching the skaters

22:25.694 --> 22:28.434
and the girls and
all the stuff going on.

22:28.582 --> 22:29.970
The only bad thing was...

22:30.113 --> 22:33.446
I started thinking about other things,
like my parents.

22:34.322 --> 22:34.737
Hello?

22:34.879 --> 22:37.204
My dad had supposedly moved out.

22:37.349 --> 22:39.852
But he kept calling the house,
bugging us.

22:39.993 --> 22:41.618
And my mom was
not handling it well.

22:41.768 --> 22:44.271
And my poor brother Henry,
he was thirteen,

22:44.412 --> 22:48.303
and he would get so worried
about stuff he'd throw up his dinner.

22:48.482 --> 22:50.107
Couldn't handle the stress at all.

22:51.092 --> 22:53.001
I also thought about Jennifer.

22:53.388 --> 22:56.128
She seemed pretty determined
for us to be together. I mean...

22:56.276 --> 22:57.735
...worse things could happen.

22:58.190 --> 23:00.692
I just wish I'd like her
more or we had more in common.

23:00.834 --> 23:01.973
Hey kid!

23:03.547 --> 23:07.651
Hey! You gonna ride
that skateboard or sit on it?

23:07.792 --> 23:09.524
I'm waiting for someone.

23:12.941 --> 23:16.001
Wo. What's up?
You gonna ride this thing, man?

23:16.142 --> 23:17.530
I'm waiting for somebody.

23:17.673 --> 23:18.882
You're not gonna let me ride it.

23:19.622 --> 23:20.974
I'm waiting for someone.

23:22.647 --> 23:26.467
You know there's dead bodies buried here
...under the cement?

23:26.614 --> 23:27.338
Isn't that right?

23:27.484 --> 23:28.693
Yeah, that's true.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.671
Come on, tell you what.

23:29.815 --> 23:31.440
Let me ride the board,
I don't come back,

23:31.590 --> 23:33.772
you can have the little hottie
right here.

23:34.094 --> 23:35.897
- All right.
- Isn't she cute?

23:39.626 --> 23:42.651
Hey... I'm Paisley, and this is Jolt.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.467
Hey, check out Scratch.

23:58.901 --> 24:01.404
Sweet, thanks, man.
Told you I'd come back.

24:02.033 --> 24:05.615
Yeah, no problem.
So where you guys live?

24:06.416 --> 24:07.769
Right here, man.

24:07.913 --> 24:09.193
At the skatepark?

24:09.339 --> 24:11.356
- Pretty much.
- This is our fucking home!

24:11.495 --> 24:12.634
How 'bout you?

24:12.922 --> 24:13.858
With my mom.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.235
You wanna ride a train, man?
You wanna get some beer?

24:18.176 --> 24:18.863
All right.

24:19.010 --> 24:19.876
How 'bout you guys?

24:20.019 --> 24:21.478
We'll stay here, man.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.070
He asked if I wanted to get some beer.

24:49.557 --> 24:51.146
I didn't know about the beer,

24:51.472 --> 24:53.524
but I really wanted to ride
a freight train.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.847
Then later that night,
I drove back to Jared's.

24:59.995 --> 25:02.628
I had to change out of my clothes,
they were so thrashed.

25:20.801 --> 25:22.295
Say name and city, please.

25:22.436 --> 25:24.868
Yeah, Tremain in Gearhart,
please.

25:26.507 --> 25:29.247
Press one to be connected
at no additional fee.

25:29.394 --> 25:31.339
Happy Citizenship Day.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.323
So, how are things with your parents?

26:16.746 --> 26:19.770
Not that good. It's official now,
they're gonna get a divorce.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.503
That must be hard.

26:21.651 --> 26:23.490
Yeah well, its out in the open.

26:26.522 --> 26:28.076
I uh... heard about you and Jennifer.

26:28.227 --> 26:31.323
Well, I think, everyone heard
about you and Jennifer. So...

26:31.462 --> 26:32.149
Yeah...

26:32.298 --> 26:33.329
That didn't last very long.

26:33.481 --> 26:34.205
Naw, it didn't.

26:34.351 --> 26:36.818
So... why'd you break up with her?

26:36.959 --> 26:39.248
Why was I even going out with her,
you mean.

26:39.395 --> 26:42.385
Yeah, that's what I mean, but,
you must have liked her a little?

26:42.526 --> 26:44.638
Well, I liked her
a little last summer...

26:44.788 --> 26:46.900
before she decided
I was her boyfriend.

26:47.328 --> 26:48.609
Well with all the stuff
you're going through,

26:48.755 --> 26:50.249
I guess something
like that could be hard.

26:50.390 --> 26:52.963
Whatever. What?

26:53.173 --> 26:56.755
Macy... you know there's just...
everybody's parents get divorced.

26:56.895 --> 27:00.857
There's... other problems.
Bigger problems.

27:01.001 --> 27:02.460
Like what?

27:02.602 --> 27:07.323
Like... people dying in Iraq...
starving kids in Africa.

27:07.472 --> 27:09.584
Since when do you care
about starving children in Africa?

27:09.734 --> 27:12.023
Well, you know what I mean, just...
the little problems,

27:12.169 --> 27:14.007
they're just all so stupid.

27:14.152 --> 27:15.990
Not if it's happening to you.

27:17.527 --> 27:20.267
Well... just all the stuff in general.

27:20.519 --> 27:23.923
So... it seems like something
did happen to you.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.701
No, you know what I mean, Macy.

27:27.164 --> 27:30.983
Not really.
So, did something happen to you?

27:31.374 --> 27:36.546
No... I just feel
like there's like something,

27:36.697 --> 27:37.978
outside of normal life.

27:38.124 --> 27:42.845
Outside of... teachers,
breakups, girlfriends...

27:42.994 --> 27:45.248
Like, right out there.

27:46.474 --> 27:51.895
Like, outside... there's like,
different levels... of stuff.

27:52.284 --> 27:54.917
And... there's something
that happened to me.

27:55.067 --> 27:56.075
I thought so.

28:34.661 --> 28:39.002
Alex... Alex...

28:47.290 --> 28:50.480
What, you just gonna walk right past me?

28:56.265 --> 28:58.448
So, did you have fun
with Jared on Saturday?

28:58.597 --> 28:59.700
Not really.

28:59.849 --> 29:01.165
What'd you guys do?

29:01.346 --> 29:02.840
Just hung out.

29:03.016 --> 29:05.933
Well, I went swimming at Elizabeth's.
You should have come.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.544
But, right, I guess that stuff doesn't
interest you anymore because,

29:08.686 --> 29:10.560
skating with Jared is more fun.

29:10.809 --> 29:11.260
But...

29:11.400 --> 29:12.895
Whatever, shut up.

29:13.488 --> 29:15.884
So... what are you doing after school?

29:16.028 --> 29:17.202
Nothing.

29:17.767 --> 29:19.641
We could do something if you want.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.521
OK.

29:23.126 --> 29:26.530
Cool. So, you gonna walk me to my class?

29:26.674 --> 29:27.646
OK.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.163
Come out.

29:36.450 --> 29:37.589
Don't laugh.

29:40.243 --> 29:41.215
The pants are a little too big.

29:41.356 --> 29:44.998
Oh, my god. OK, I think that's
your sexiest look yet, Alex.

29:46.644 --> 29:51.163
I need to get smaller pants.
But does it look good?

29:52.002 --> 29:54.600
It's um... it's interesting.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.454
You should try something on.

29:57.395 --> 30:00.420
OK... change. You change now.

30:01.256 --> 30:02.916
Oh my god.

30:03.554 --> 30:04.384
Does it fit you?

30:04.527 --> 30:07.967
No, it's really big.
Look, the straps are like huge.

30:08.216 --> 30:09.046
It looks good.

30:09.189 --> 30:10.126
It's all like, huge.

30:10.268 --> 30:11.406
Shall we?

30:13.052 --> 30:15.128
Take this. Take your shirt.

30:15.418 --> 30:19.415
Give me... I need my clothes!
Go, move... get out.

30:21.366 --> 30:25.150
I need my dress!
Can I have my dress back? Thank you.

30:34.101 --> 30:37.778
Get out! You can't be in here.
I... stop.

30:43.459 --> 30:44.989
Dude, that's not your board.

30:45.130 --> 30:46.588
Yeah it is, I just got it.

30:46.730 --> 30:48.604
What'd you get a new board for?

30:48.991 --> 30:51.945
Because I wanted
to try something different.

30:52.088 --> 30:53.582
Why didn't you tell me about this?

30:53.722 --> 30:55.490
Why would I tell you,
it's just a new board.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.739
Dude because I gotta skate with you

30:56.889 --> 30:59.427
and I can't have some fag board riding
next to me.

30:59.568 --> 31:01.821
Wow, it's not even a fag board.
Just drive.

31:01.968 --> 31:02.940
Yeah OK...

31:38.569 --> 31:42.175
Mm mm. I got boogie buns...

31:44.379 --> 31:46.597
Is... is that techno stuff?

33:42.254 --> 33:44.756
Dude, we should go check out
Paranoid Park.

33:49.456 --> 33:51.993
Dude, I don't think I'm ready
for Paranoid Park.

33:54.361 --> 33:56.935
Yeah but no one's ever really ready
for Paranoid Park.

34:02.816 --> 34:04.760
This is News Break,
I'm Ken Boddie.

34:04.903 --> 34:08.687
Was it a horrible accident
or was it murder?

34:08.835 --> 34:11.540
Police are investigating
a grisly scene

34:11.688 --> 34:15.293
at the central train yard
near downtown Portland.

34:15.445 --> 34:17.806
A security guard was found dead,

34:17.951 --> 34:21.913
literally cut in half
by the wheels of a freight train.

34:22.056 --> 34:24.831
Police say there is evidence
of foul play,

34:24.978 --> 34:28.348
but they aren't releasing
any more details at this time.

34:28.492 --> 34:32.455
And at this point,
there are no possible suspects.

34:32.598 --> 34:36.143
We are following this case closely
and will have more tonight...

34:36.286 --> 34:38.859
on KOIN News Six, at eleven.

35:22.419 --> 35:25.266
I know, I woke up passed out laying
next to the vending machines.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.215
I don't remember anything
that happened that night.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.296
Were you drinking?

35:28.369 --> 35:30.907
Yeah. I have no idea what happened.

35:31.082 --> 35:33.371
I thought this master plan
was supposed to work.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.710
Hey you know why that kid's getting...
arrested?

35:36.858 --> 35:39.527
Oh, yeah. He just got like caught
for pot or something.

35:39.676 --> 35:42.452
I don't know. He's not gonna get
a fair trial, though.

35:48.061 --> 35:48.891
That's my corndog, man.

35:49.036 --> 35:49.451
I'm starving.

35:49.591 --> 35:55.677
Will the following people please report
to the principal's office?

35:55.819 --> 35:59.330
Jared Fitch, Christian Barlow,
Paul and Alex Tremain.

35:59.473 --> 36:00.718
Did he just call my name?

36:00.864 --> 36:02.109
Yeah.

36:11.580 --> 36:14.320
Dude, all the skater kids
are getting called to the office, man.

37:37.168 --> 37:39.908
OK, this is Detective Lu.

37:40.299 --> 37:43.145
Hello... hello... Hey, Lu Lu.

37:43.291 --> 37:44.300
Guys.

37:45.483 --> 37:46.455
What are those cuffs for?

37:46.597 --> 37:47.665
Handcuffs... handcuffs.

37:47.814 --> 37:49.581
Hey... show him some respect, please.

37:49.728 --> 37:51.151
Show me respect.

37:51.676 --> 37:53.064
Respect my...

37:53.207 --> 37:57.204
All right... Thank you, uh... Miss Adams.

38:02.392 --> 38:03.293
Damn!

38:05.175 --> 38:07.119
Check... What you looking at? Huh?

38:07.262 --> 38:08.234
Anyway...

38:09.524 --> 38:12.264
Like she said my name
is Detective Richard Lu.

38:12.481 --> 38:13.655
You can, call me Rich.

38:13.803 --> 38:14.669
Or Lu Lu.

38:14.813 --> 38:16.473
And, so you know, my...

38:16.622 --> 38:18.424
partner and I are here
to investigate a murder

38:18.570 --> 38:21.797
that occurred downtown...
near a skateboard park.

38:22.571 --> 38:24.860
So the police department
wants us to get in touch

38:25.006 --> 38:29.312
and make some contacts with the...
skateboard community.

38:29.459 --> 38:32.650
And hopefully you can help us solve a...
a case that we have here.

38:32.799 --> 38:37.734
So anyway... what I wanna do is uh...
talk to you guys and get to know ya.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.017
Let's go ahead
and just go around the room...

38:39.167 --> 38:39.962
I want to get to know you, too.

38:40.106 --> 38:41.802
I want you to introduce yourselves.
Start here.

38:41.950 --> 38:42.709
- I'm Paul Thrief.
- Paul.

38:42.854 --> 38:43.720
Jeremy.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.444
Eric.

38:44.594 --> 38:45.566
- Christian.
- Christian.

38:45.708 --> 38:46.918
- Cal.
- Cal.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.203
Alex.

38:48.351 --> 38:49.976
- Jared.
- Jared.

38:50.126 --> 38:51.134
Jeremy.

38:51.274 --> 38:52.305
Brian.

38:52.457 --> 38:56.491
OK. Raise your hands...
if you've ever been,

38:56.632 --> 38:58.542
to the Eastside Skateboard Park.

38:58.685 --> 39:00.072
You know everybody's
gonna raise their hand...

39:00.215 --> 39:01.840
But it's called Paranoid Park,
nobody calls it...

39:01.990 --> 39:05.015
Paranoid. OK, so you all have.

39:05.156 --> 39:06.852
OK, good, that's what I was hoping for.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.686
Now of those who rose your hands,
who was there, at any time,

39:11.836 --> 39:15.940
during the weekend of
September sixteenth, or seventeenth?

39:19.212 --> 39:20.980
OK, um... Jared.

39:21.126 --> 39:26.132
Yeah. Yeah, we uh...
Alex and I went there like...

39:26.275 --> 39:28.979
that week... during the day, though.

39:29.127 --> 39:30.930
During the week.
Do you remember what day that was?

39:31.076 --> 39:33.614
Uh, I don't know. Tuesday maybe?

39:33.755 --> 39:34.300
OK.

39:34.451 --> 39:37.440
We actually planned to go there
that weekend but we didn't.

39:37.721 --> 39:39.180
You didn't. So what did you do, then?

39:39.495 --> 39:41.927
I went down to Oregon State.

39:42.626 --> 39:44.014
OK, Corvalis. All right.

39:44.158 --> 39:47.076
So... you went to OSU,
so you went to Paranoid Park?

39:47.220 --> 39:48.050
No.

39:48.193 --> 39:49.961
You did not. OK, where did you go?

39:50.107 --> 39:53.476
I... I didn't want to go the park
by myself so... I didn't.

39:53.621 --> 39:56.052
Yeah, no one wants to go
the Paranoid by themself, man.

39:56.195 --> 39:57.476
That place is scary.

39:57.622 --> 39:58.831
- I always go there.
- Yeah, true.

39:58.979 --> 40:02.313
They only mess if you make
a mess with them. I always go there.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.711
Man, whatever. I'm just
saying it has like a reputation.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.843
OK, all right. I understand that.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.311
Let's... let's get started here...

40:10.460 --> 40:12.405
Hey, what exactly
are you accusing us of?

40:12.722 --> 40:14.454
Well, I'm not accusing you of anything,
nothing at all.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.474
I mean... this is not about suspects.

40:16.619 --> 40:22.147
In fact, just so we're clear,
nobody here in this room is a suspect.

40:22.289 --> 40:23.748
In fact if you were a suspect,

40:23.890 --> 40:26.357
we'd be treating you a little
differently than we are today, OK?

40:26.499 --> 40:28.551
What it is, is that I'm trying to learn,

40:28.691 --> 40:33.104
and get some background from you guys
about your skateboard... community.

40:33.249 --> 40:35.645
It's not like a community.
It's not like we know each other.

40:35.789 --> 40:36.857
Well, I understand that.

40:37.006 --> 40:41.348
In fact... let me flip this around,
let me give you some background here.

40:41.495 --> 40:46.251
What we have,
is a... possible murder situation.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.787
Will you hand that out for me?

40:48.174 --> 40:51.329
Take a look at these pictures
and you can understand why we're here.

40:54.054 --> 40:58.917
Aw, dude! Let me see.

40:59.273 --> 41:01.598
Oh sh... shit...

41:01.743 --> 41:03.760
Gentlemen, that's the real deal there.

41:07.414 --> 41:09.253
It's like part of his clothes is
on the bar...

41:09.467 --> 41:12.314
Now the deceased there was found on
the railroad tracks just outside of

41:12.459 --> 41:16.207
the central train yard...
over by downtown.

41:16.356 --> 41:19.760
Now the train that was involved
in this thing here you're looking at...

41:20.183 --> 41:24.003
just before it got to that yard it,
went by...

41:24.149 --> 41:26.509
the Eastside Skateboard Park.

41:26.654 --> 41:27.484
- Eastside...
- So?

41:27.628 --> 41:28.600
Eastside!?

41:28.742 --> 41:29.881
It's called Paranoid Park here, man.

41:30.029 --> 41:33.018
Well... exactly.
And... and you know what?

41:33.578 --> 41:37.291
We think it's possible,
if this is a murder... situation,

41:37.439 --> 41:42.754
that somebody from... Paranoid Park...
was involved with this.

41:42.902 --> 41:43.933
So you think a skateboarder did it?

41:47.704 --> 41:49.506
Check out that.

42:57.287 --> 42:59.434
I had tried to put this part out
of my mind.

42:59.722 --> 43:02.604
But Lu's picture
brought it all back.

43:05.010 --> 43:07.371
This was my chance to take a moment,
to think for a second,

43:07.516 --> 43:09.425
to figure out the best thing to do.

44:06.000 --> 44:06.546
Woo!

44:15.672 --> 44:17.202
Pretty cool, huh?

44:17.586 --> 44:20.326
Next time you ride a train get
on in the same spot.

44:20.717 --> 44:25.367
It's safer there.
If you lose your grip and you swing off,

44:25.519 --> 44:28.057
you'll just hit the side
and bounce back in.

44:28.614 --> 44:32.648
If you're riding here and you fall off,
you're gonna go right under there.

44:35.886 --> 44:39.433
Woo! You like this man,
you diggin' it?

44:57.805 --> 45:00.723
Oh quick, man, hide! Hide hide hide.
Hide, man, hide hide!

47:27.166 --> 47:29.218
He was trying to kill us.
He had a lead bat.

47:29.358 --> 47:32.454
Why... why can't
you just understand that...

47:34.507 --> 47:35.574
God... you know...

47:35.724 --> 47:36.863
Call the police.

47:37.012 --> 47:38.542
It's OK, Alex,
you're not gonna get in trouble.

47:38.682 --> 47:39.998
Call home...

47:40.943 --> 47:43.055
Call Someone.
It was self-defense.

47:43.205 --> 47:44.794
I thought about my skateboard...

47:47.241 --> 47:48.522
People defend themselves all the time.

47:48.668 --> 47:52.108
But never mind that...
I had to tell someone.

47:53.330 --> 47:55.618
Maybe that was the thing...
It's OK, Alex.

47:55.765 --> 47:57.046
You're not gonna get in trouble.
It's OK.

47:57.192 --> 47:59.208
Get a lawyer first...
then call the police.

47:59.905 --> 48:01.981
That's what sports people did...

48:03.106 --> 48:06.581
Just calm down, Alex.
...Didn't it?

48:09.925 --> 48:12.428
My brain could have debates
all night long.

48:12.570 --> 48:13.506
My body didn't care.

48:13.648 --> 48:16.673
My body wanted only one thing,
to get the hell out of there.

48:20.954 --> 48:21.678
Oh my god!

48:26.103 --> 48:27.348
Oh my god!

53:58.782 --> 54:01.319
I was so screwed.
What was I going to do?

54:01.461 --> 54:04.166
I shouldn't waste time.
I needed to talk to someone.

54:04.349 --> 54:07.124
I needed to take an action
and get this weight off me.

54:07.514 --> 54:10.361
My dad, that was the person to talk to.

54:10.507 --> 54:14.053
I knew where he was,
at my Uncle Tommy's.

54:15.795 --> 54:18.393
I could already feel the relief
of telling him.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.569
Say name and city, please.

54:29.711 --> 54:32.249
Yeah, Tremain in Gearhart,
please.

54:33.818 --> 54:36.558
Press one to be connected
at no additional fee.

54:36.705 --> 54:38.649
Happy Citizenship Day.

56:37.536 --> 56:40.133
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home so early?

56:40.285 --> 56:42.301
We didn't go the Expo, Jared got sick.

56:42.442 --> 56:43.450
What did he get sick with?

56:43.590 --> 56:44.800
Not sure.

57:12.502 --> 57:13.332
Honey?

57:15.946 --> 57:16.741
Hey, honey?

57:16.886 --> 57:17.467
What?

57:17.617 --> 57:19.491
Uh, Uncle Tommy called earlier.

57:19.634 --> 57:22.730
He said he got a call at the beach,
on his caller ID.

57:22.870 --> 57:24.044
He did?

57:24.192 --> 57:26.766
Yeah, he said the call was
from the Fitch's, and...

57:26.906 --> 57:28.887
he asked me if I e...
knew anyone of that name

57:29.028 --> 57:31.317
and I told him that's
where you were staying.

57:31.742 --> 57:32.916
Oh.

57:34.317 --> 57:36.226
Did you call Uncle Tommy's?

57:36.404 --> 57:38.693
Yeah, maybe by accident.

57:38.909 --> 57:41.863
Well he said the call was
at 4:35 in the morning.

57:42.284 --> 57:43.672
That's weird.

57:44.580 --> 57:46.277
Were you still awake then?

57:46.702 --> 57:52.503
N... no... But... then again,
I was trying to call Ryan...

57:52.652 --> 57:57.764
but... I could have been half asleep or,
even sleepwalking. Hm.

57:59.471 --> 58:00.574
Oh.

58:00.689 --> 58:01.554
Yeah.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.469
So I have no clue.

58:09.804 --> 58:10.872
OK.

58:19.128 --> 58:21.489
I'm going to the mall
to check out some snowboards...

58:21.633 --> 58:23.507
since I didn't go to the Expo.

58:23.652 --> 58:27.329
Oh, OK. Well that's all right with me.
Uh, hey, where's your skateboard?

58:27.478 --> 58:29.008
Oh, I left it at Jared's.

58:29.706 --> 58:30.500
OK.

58:54.999 --> 58:56.066
Morning, how are you doing?

58:56.216 --> 58:56.868
Good.

58:57.016 --> 58:57.811
What can I get you?

58:57.956 --> 58:59.759
Uh, I'll just get a glass of water,
is that cool?

58:59.905 --> 59:01.529
Yeah. I'll leave this here
if you change your mind.

59:01.679 --> 59:03.032
Thanks. All right.

59:13.752 --> 59:16.669
Hey. What are you doing here
so early?

59:16.813 --> 59:18.094
Nothing.

59:18.901 --> 59:21.996
Really? Looks like you're...
reading the news.

59:22.136 --> 59:23.452
Yeah I'm just reading the newspaper.

59:23.598 --> 59:25.615
Oh. Anything in there about the war?

59:25.720 --> 59:26.656
Nope.

59:26.798 --> 59:28.328
Just checkin' out the sports.

59:28.468 --> 59:32.288
In the Metro? Yeah...

01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:07.497
In the Metro? Yeah...

01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:08.682
Hey, Rachel.

01:00:08.827 --> 01:00:10.001
Hey, Alex.

01:00:10.323 --> 01:00:14.700
So uh... so that's why you came,
just to read the newspaper?

01:00:14.846 --> 01:00:17.207
I was just bored so I came to the mall.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.301
I just wondered. Yeah...

01:00:20.934 --> 01:00:23.639
Well, we're gonna go see a movie.
You wanna... come with us?

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:24.759
No, thanks, I'm good.

01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:27.534
Rather sit here and...
pretend to look at sports?

01:00:27.684 --> 01:00:29.000
Yeah, sports section.

01:00:29.145 --> 01:00:32.620
OK, um... Yeah,
I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:33.178
OK.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.708
So... yeah. Bye.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:35.680
See ya.

01:02:29.072 --> 01:02:30.140
That's a good one.

01:02:30.673 --> 01:02:31.609
Thanks.

01:02:35.265 --> 01:02:36.368
No no no...

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.186
- What...?
- You put a mirror in the...

01:02:42.328 --> 01:02:43.608
How? It doesn't make sense...

01:02:43.754 --> 01:02:45.308
I don't know, you...
you throw it down there...

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:46.183
Why would that...

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.360
...look at yourself?

01:02:47.512 --> 01:02:48.093
Yeah, how would you...

01:02:48.242 --> 01:02:49.772
But it'd be all mucky,
you won't be able to see.

01:02:49.913 --> 01:02:51.609
I don't know, Gabe told it to me.
I didn't get it.

01:02:51.756 --> 01:02:52.930
That's a terrible joke...

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:55.469
I mean, Alex...

01:02:55.862 --> 01:02:57.072
Alex. Alex...

01:02:57.219 --> 01:02:58.428
Awkward...

01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:00.864
- Awkward.
- As in Alex.

01:03:02.194 --> 01:03:03.130
That... that just...

01:05:04.278 --> 01:05:06.187
Do you think we should do it again?

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.449
Or... maybe we should wait.

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:13.911
You know, we're gonna need more condoms.

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.749
We should go to Rite Aid and get 'em.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:18.505
That's where um...
Pauline and George get theirs.

01:05:44.045 --> 01:05:46.026
Yes, we totally did it.

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:48.243
Oh my god, I know right?

01:05:48.707 --> 01:05:50.474
No, it was fantastic.

01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:53.263
OK, OK, I gotta go. All right.

01:05:53.369 --> 01:05:55.136
Do you think Lu knows
more than he's telling us?

01:05:55.282 --> 01:05:56.421
Like what?

01:05:57.093 --> 01:06:00.047
I don't know, like he's...
trying to trick us or something.

01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:01.433
That's what detectives do.

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.692
No dude, don't be paranoid.
Why even worry about it?

01:06:03.842 --> 01:06:05.158
I mean, he like, doesn't know anything.

01:06:05.303 --> 01:06:06.856
He just like acting like he does.

01:06:07.008 --> 01:06:08.846
Yeah, but that was pretty weird, though.

01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:12.597
The detective coming to the school,
and only talking to skateboarders?

01:06:12.749 --> 01:06:13.128
Yeah...

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.260
Dude, cops are like that.
I mean, why do you think they're cops?

01:06:16.401 --> 01:06:18.477
They get paid less than a janitor.

01:06:19.046 --> 01:06:21.857
Yeah, but I mean they do it
for other reasons.

01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:26.131
Like what? Grownups do stuff for money.
There is no other reasons.

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:32.678
Cops do shit like that.
Just random shit.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:06:59.813
Hey babe.

01:06:59.961 --> 01:07:00.648
Hey.

01:07:00.796 --> 01:07:02.219
Did you get the condoms yet?

01:07:02.361 --> 01:07:03.297
Nope.

01:07:03.405 --> 01:07:05.693
Do you wann get 'em, after school?

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:07.227
Maybe.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.183
What's the matter? Are you mad?

01:07:10.328 --> 01:07:11.502
No.

01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:14.781
Well, you sure do act weird sometimes,

01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:17.839
because you'd think after what we did
you'd be a little more happy to see me.

01:07:17.983 --> 01:07:18.991
It was your idea.

01:07:19.305 --> 01:07:21.807
What?! What is that supposed to mean?

01:07:21.949 --> 01:07:22.958
Nothing.

01:07:23.097 --> 01:07:27.404
So having sex was my idea.
You didn't want to. You just went along.

01:07:27.551 --> 01:07:28.903
No, I'm just saying.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:32.381
You were the one that,
wanted to get the condoms, so...

01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.435
I thought we'd get 'em together.

01:07:35.657 --> 01:07:38.432
Oh. OK, sorry.

01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:40.239
I thought you were
talking about something else.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.669
No, that's all I meant.

01:07:42.302 --> 01:07:44.211
OK, well, we'll do that.

01:08:22.278 --> 01:08:22.895
Hey, Alex.

01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:24.218
Hey, Dad.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.426
Oh, shit, wondered where this was.

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.122
Are you gonna take that?

01:08:41.657 --> 01:08:43.116
I'm just gonna borrow it.

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:46.519
Your Uncle Tommy and I are going up
to the lake this weekend.

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:56.474
Do you need this?

01:08:56.618 --> 01:08:58.350
Yeah... thanks.

01:09:00.549 --> 01:09:01.557
Look I wanted to talk to you,

01:09:01.697 --> 01:09:05.410
I don't... I don't know
what you've heard or...

01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:06.662
what your mother's been telling ya.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:11.568
Um... but I'm probably
not gonna be comin' around here anymore.

01:09:11.996 --> 01:09:14.011
Um, we're still working
on the details, logistics and,

01:09:14.152 --> 01:09:19.015
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for... for you and Henry.

01:09:19.232 --> 01:09:25.176
Uh, working with your mother is...
not the easiest thing in the world...

01:09:25.321 --> 01:09:26.874
as I'm sure you know.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:30.500
But if there's any special
considerations that you have...

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:33.419
um... be sure and let me know.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:38.988
How's school going,
how are your classes?

01:09:39.863 --> 01:09:41.287
School's good.

01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:43.756
How are Parker and those guys?

01:09:44.282 --> 01:09:45.563
They're fine.

01:09:45.846 --> 01:09:48.479
I saw Parker's dad the other night
at Outdoor World.

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:49.698
Yeah?

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:50.747
Yeah...

01:09:56.633 --> 01:09:58.056
Are you still skateboarding?

01:09:58.268 --> 01:09:59.928
Yeah, a little.

01:10:00.391 --> 01:10:01.327
Right on.

01:10:03.348 --> 01:10:06.717
Well, listen, I should be uh...
getting' my homework done, so...

01:10:06.862 --> 01:10:08.143
Look I...

01:10:10.236 --> 01:10:12.110
I just want you to know that...

01:10:13.437 --> 01:10:16.070
I feel horrible
about this whole situation.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.491
I never, never in a million years wanted
anything like this to happen.

01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:25.300
If there's anything, anything
that I can do to make it easier for you

01:10:26.311 --> 01:10:28.422
...please, let me know.

01:10:28.537 --> 01:10:29.853
I know how you feel, Dad.

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:45.892
Jennifer! Jennifer.

01:11:35.198 --> 01:11:36.443
I can't believe you.

01:11:37.182 --> 01:11:40.028
You think you can break up
with me after we had sex.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.694
Why would you give up free sex?
She was even hot.

01:12:02.475 --> 01:12:05.179
Yeah dude, hope you have a backup,
or somethin'.

01:12:07.763 --> 01:12:09.780
Dude, her and her friends
were just drama.

01:12:09.955 --> 01:12:13.538
Dude, I don't know
what you're talking about. You're crazy.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.216
Dude, I didn't like her either.

01:12:16.392 --> 01:12:19.061
But getting laid is always better
than not getting laid.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.146
Yeah, man.

01:12:20.358 --> 01:12:21.461
True that.

01:12:21.959 --> 01:12:22.860
How's it going?

01:12:23.002 --> 01:12:26.371
Good. Do you guys have,
caramel cappuccinos?

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:29.221
No, we don't have caramel cappuccinos.

01:12:29.369 --> 01:12:29.820
Damn. Do you guys...?

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.620
That's only... that's only Starbucks.

01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:35.067
Robin, can I get a slice of pie?

01:12:35.214 --> 01:12:36.114
Mm hm.

01:12:36.293 --> 01:12:37.953
This looks really good.

01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:42.479
Hey, guys. Need a coffee.
Say that again.

01:12:53.618 --> 01:12:56.192
Let me pick this up actually.

01:12:57.619 --> 01:12:59.078
Coffee.

01:13:13.658 --> 01:13:17.857
You remember... you remember Tina...
the llama?

01:13:18.147 --> 01:13:18.906
I think so.

01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:22.313
"Tina, you fat lard,
come get some dinner!"

01:13:23.505 --> 01:13:27.811
And uh, remember he's at school,
the chapstick part?

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:30.874
He's like, with the nurse he's like...
he's like,

01:13:31.019 --> 01:13:32.644
"Can I use the phone?"

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.483
"Why?"

01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:35.847
"'Cause I don't feel good!"

01:13:36.099 --> 01:13:39.398
And, he uses the phone...
he... and it's his...

01:13:39.613 --> 01:13:42.246
brother Kip, he's kind of a wuss.

01:13:42.396 --> 01:13:46.145
He's like, he's like, he's like,
um, "I... is Grandma there?"

01:13:46.293 --> 01:13:50.564
He's like, "No Napolean..."
"Can I... Well, where is she?"

01:13:50.712 --> 01:13:52.444
"At the dunes."

01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:55.331
"Since when does Grandma
go to the dunes?"

01:13:55.478 --> 01:13:57.554
"I don't know,
she's with her boyfriend.

01:13:57.705 --> 01:13:59.650
"He's like, "What?"
And he's like,

01:13:59.793 --> 01:14:01.869
"Can you at least bring me
my chapstick?"

01:14:02.019 --> 01:14:04.000
He's like, "No, Napolean.

01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:07.616
"He's like, "God!" And then... he says,

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.014
"Come on, just...
just borrow some from the nurse,

01:14:10.161 --> 01:14:12.734
she has like fifty sticks
in her drawer."

01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:13.456
And he's like,

01:14:13.605 --> 01:14:17.151
"Ew, I'm not gonna use nurse chapstick,
you sicko!"

01:14:17.293 --> 01:14:20.139
And then he hangs up. And then, um...

01:14:20.285 --> 01:14:21.566
We should be out now, dude.

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:22.399
What are you talking about?

01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:24.384
- The war... Iraq...
- no

01:14:24.529 --> 01:14:25.430
Oh.

01:14:25.573 --> 01:14:26.474
What do you think?

01:14:26.617 --> 01:14:28.241
I really don't care.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:30.963
Geez... that's the kind of thing
that's wrong

01:14:31.105 --> 01:14:33.252
with people today. Apathy...

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.267
What?

01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:35.762
Oh, not caring.

01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:38.018
I don't really know much about the war.

01:14:38.168 --> 01:14:40.837
Figure it out, dude. Read the newspaper.

01:14:40.986 --> 01:14:44.106
I hate... reading the newspaper
about the war.

01:14:45.508 --> 01:14:46.896
OK, I'll never...

01:15:14.282 --> 01:15:18.516
Hello? Hello?

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:20.466
Bad...

01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:22.381
Why are you lying in the middle
of the driveway?

01:15:22.528 --> 01:15:24.022
Because...

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:26.343
Is it fun down there?

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:28.927
You know what, just push me.

01:15:29.033 --> 01:15:31.631
Wait wait wait. What about your face?

01:15:32.513 --> 01:15:35.253
Just go. Pedal.

01:15:35.366 --> 01:15:36.718
Hold on a sec.

01:16:07.965 --> 01:16:08.937
I have the answer.

01:16:09.078 --> 01:16:10.015
To what?

01:16:10.122 --> 01:16:11.996
Like when you were saying...
if something happened,

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.729
to you and you couldn't tell anyone.

01:16:13.845 --> 01:16:15.683
It doesn't matter, just forget it.

01:16:16.211 --> 01:16:19.437
See, what I would do is...
I'd write a letter.

01:16:19.551 --> 01:16:20.583
To who?

01:16:20.768 --> 01:16:23.366
The person you did it to.
Like, an apology or whatever.

01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:26.090
Or... maybe to someone else,
like a separate person.

01:16:26.231 --> 01:16:28.343
But the point is,
to get it down and off your chest.

01:16:28.493 --> 01:16:30.545
And then, you can stop stressing.

01:16:30.684 --> 01:16:34.160
And, what am I supposed to do
with the letter... after?

01:16:34.268 --> 01:16:38.231
Doesn't matter, like, save it,
send it, burn it, you know?

01:16:38.373 --> 01:16:40.070
Th... writing it down
is the important thing.

01:16:40.217 --> 01:16:43.692
So... yeah. I mean, once you get it out
there you'll feel way better.

01:16:43.835 --> 01:16:45.009
It's a big relief.

01:16:45.157 --> 01:16:48.348
I don't know, Macy, it sounds like
a homework assignment or something.

01:16:48.498 --> 01:16:50.787
Trust me, it's
not a homework assignment.

01:16:50.933 --> 01:16:54.539
You know...
it just feels good to have it all out.

01:16:55.352 --> 01:16:57.296
Yeah... maybe.

01:16:57.788 --> 01:17:01.536
But, the trick is... write it
to someone you can really talk to,

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:02.965
like someone you're comfortable with.

01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:05.542
Not your parents or your teachers
or whatever.

01:17:05.685 --> 01:17:07.001
Write it to a friend.

01:17:07.146 --> 01:17:08.320
Yeah.

01:17:08.642 --> 01:17:10.551
Write it to me.

01:17:23.429 --> 01:17:27.213
OK, Macy. It's late now.
I'm gonna stop.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.819
All right, we're gonna follow up
on yesterday's field study

01:19:52.964 --> 01:19:55.466
and we're gonna
look at the macro-invertebrates.

01:19:55.851 --> 01:19:57.868
We're gonna look at the tolerant group
and the...

01:19:58.008 --> 01:19:58.494
intolerant group...

01:19:58.634 --> 01:20:02.275
And let's put a... drop of uh,
pond water on it.

01:20:03.157 --> 01:20:07.428
And let's classify...
micro-invertebrates.

01:20:10.221 --> 01:20:11.252
Alex?
