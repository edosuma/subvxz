00:02.100 --> 00:03.501
Shit!

00:05.132 --> 00:06.329
Care for an autograph?

00:06.363 --> 00:08.464
That's me and you,
Saturday night.

00:08.497 --> 00:10.096
We found Eduardo Sanchez.

00:10.130 --> 00:11.529
Who is Eduardo Sanchez?

00:11.563 --> 00:13.197
He's a mystery best
left for another day.

00:13.231 --> 00:15.664
Maria, my sister-in-law,
she's available.

00:15.699 --> 00:16.832
She is?

00:16.867 --> 00:18.467
I have feelings for your mom.

00:18.501 --> 00:20.701
I'm ready to commit
to the both of you.

00:20.735 --> 00:22.836
Hey, Kenny!
Nobody gives a shit for you.

00:22.870 --> 00:25.337
What are you doing?

00:25.372 --> 00:27.905
Finally, motherfuckers!
Finally!

00:27.939 --> 00:29.908

Chapter 10:
Making the world your bitch.

01:01.590 --> 01:05.693
Once again, I'm with
the hottest chick in town.

01:05.727 --> 01:08.727
<i>Buying the most
expensive fashions.</i>

01:10.163 --> 01:13.998
<i>Dining in the fanciest

La Flama Blanca!

01:36.681 --> 01:38.982
Did this tale end the
way I thought it would?

01:39.017 --> 01:40.250
<i>Probably not.</i>

01:55.159 --> 01:58.894
<i>Gracias, mis amigos.</i>

01:58.929 --> 02:00.996
Thank you for fucking pill-os.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.730
Kenny.

02:02.764 --> 02:04.498
You got a minute?

02:08.835 --> 02:10.901
What the hell is all this shit?

02:10.936 --> 02:12.636
This is the wall
of the immortals.

02:12.671 --> 02:15.471
These men have all done what you
are trying to do and succeeded.

02:15.506 --> 02:18.507
They played hard enough in
Copales to get to America.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.441
I never heard of any
of these motherfuckers.

02:20.476 --> 02:22.543
Not even that amigo there?

02:22.577 --> 02:26.045
Who e fuck is that,
Pancho Villa? I don't know.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.547
When he was 12 years old,
he pitched five no-hit innings

02:28.581 --> 02:30.281
in the Little League
World Series.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.316
Ooh. Big deal. I did
the same thing in the AAU.

02:33.351 --> 02:35.952
Well, maybe for a right hander,
but this kid threw with both.

02:35.986 --> 02:37.687
Wow, so homeboy
was double banging it.

02:37.721 --> 02:39.321
Yep.
Props.

02:39.355 --> 02:41.222
Then he got drafted
by Minnesota.

02:41.257 --> 02:42.890
Made the team
as a 19-year-old.

02:42.925 --> 02:45.826
Playing ball like
he'd always dreamed.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.594
Then he started having too much
fun with the girls, huh?

02:48.628 --> 02:51.997
The drinks, speed balls.

02:52.031 --> 02:54.131
Before he knew it,
it was all gone.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.299
What's he up to now?

02:55.333 --> 02:57.133
He watches the field,

02:57.167 --> 02:59.802
imagines that things
turned out differently.

02:59.836 --> 03:01.870
Mm-mm. No thank you.

03:01.904 --> 03:04.538
I don't like to hear depressing
shit about no-name dickheads.

03:04.573 --> 03:06.006
This shit's fucking up my vibe.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.641
Why you telling me
all this bullshit?

03:07.675 --> 03:09.275
You know, Kenny,
I admire the fact

03:09.309 --> 03:11.343
that you're trying to get back
to the majors,

03:11.378 --> 03:13.912
but you gotta stop prancing
around and start playing ball.

03:13.946 --> 03:17.213
Prancing? Roger, name one time
when I've ever fucking pranced.

03:17.248 --> 03:19.082
Kenny Powers doesn't prance.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.017
Look, if you want to take it
to the next step,

03:21.051 --> 03:22.651
then you need to get serious.

03:22.686 --> 03:24.586
You fucking prance around here.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.688
Playing for this team's
not a joke.

03:26.722 --> 03:28.890
Not to me,
to the players, or to them.

03:28.924 --> 03:31.092
I don't think it's a joke.
I never said it was a joke.

03:31.126 --> 03:33.327
If you got something you
wanna say then just say it.

03:33.361 --> 03:34.962
You can save us a lot of time

03:34.996 --> 03:37.164
with this fucking pointless
history lesson

03:37.198 --> 03:40.099
in this goddamn creepy
unimpressive fucking hall.

03:40.134 --> 03:42.368
I don't like it in here.
It's gross

03:42.402 --> 03:45.070
Thanks for nothing.

03:46.606 --> 03:48.873
<i>Gracias, gracias.</i>

03:48.907 --> 03:51.877
Next song I wanna dedicate

03:51.911 --> 03:54.980
to a friend of mine,
a very special friend.

03:55.014 --> 03:56.781
Boyfriend.
You mean boyfriend.

03:56.816 --> 03:58.750
She means boyfriend,
everybody. Me.

03:58.784 --> 04:02.586
A friend of mine,
La Flama Blanca.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.257
Ooh, I love this song.

04:08.161 --> 04:10.662
Does she know you don't wanna
be called La Flama Blanca?

04:10.696 --> 04:12.831
She can call me whatever
she wants, Stevie.

04:12.865 --> 04:15.332
- Look at that brown caboose.
- Ooh.

04:15.367 --> 04:16.934
I wanna talk to you
about something,

04:16.968 --> 04:19.168
but I don't
want you to get mad.

04:19.202 --> 04:21.603
I can already tell I don't
like the sounds of this.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.606
Spill it.
Well,

04:23.640 --> 04:28.109
I have taken it upon myself to
reopen the Eduardo Sanchez case.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.343
Uh-uh. Nope.

04:29.377 --> 04:31.979
You are not authorized
to do that. Shut it down.

04:32.013 --> 04:34.614
I already told you.
I found happiness.

04:34.648 --> 04:37.950
I no longer seek the answers
that Eduardo potentially holds.

04:37.984 --> 04:41.319
Well, then I guess it doesn't
matter that I have found him.

04:41.354 --> 04:44.355
Say what?
Mm-hm.

04:44.390 --> 04:47.524
Well, not that I care,
because I don't,

04:47.558 --> 04:50.393
and you obviously should not
have reopened the case,

04:50.427 --> 04:52.262
but where is he?

04:52.296 --> 04:54.965
He's in Hollywood, baby.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.468
I did a little searching online
and it turns out homeboy

04:58.502 --> 05:01.170
<i>directed
the Blair Witch Project.</i>

05:02.939 --> 05:04.573
Heh. That's not him.

05:04.607 --> 05:06.508
Are you sure?

05:06.542 --> 05:08.409
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
the guy I'm looking for

05:08.444 --> 05:11.278
<i>didn't direct the fucking
Blair Witch Project.</i>

05:11.312 --> 05:13.747
Just forget you ever heard
the name Eduardo Sanchez.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.382
Forget that he supposedly lives
in a village near here.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.317
Forget that he is not Mexican,
but a gringo.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.453
Eduardo Sanchez is a white man
that lives near here?

05:22.487 --> 05:24.287
Stop digging for clues, Stevie.

05:24.322 --> 05:27.489
Finding Eduardo Sanchez
is the last thing I care about.

05:27.523 --> 05:31.892
All I care about is this big
brown ass right in front of me.

05:31.927 --> 05:34.095
I wish I was your dick, man.

05:42.102 --> 05:44.670
That's your dick
butt-fucking her, man.

05:58.883 --> 06:00.517
Oh. Hey, Maria.

06:00.551 --> 06:02.218
Entre. Entre.

06:07.156 --> 06:10.025
Let me help you.

06:10.059 --> 06:12.727
Maria,

06:12.761 --> 06:16.097
I just,
I want to apologize to you

06:16.131 --> 06:19.900
in case I've been aggressive in
any of my actions towards you.

06:19.934 --> 06:24.737
I just been walking around in
Kenny's shoes for so long now

06:24.772 --> 06:28.040
that I'm starting to become
exactly like him,

06:28.074 --> 06:32.377
which is awesome
and super badass.

06:32.411 --> 06:35.846
I just, I hope I haven't
intimidated you

06:35.881 --> 06:37.748
with my alpha-ness.

06:39.183 --> 06:40.684
Maria, don't.

06:40.718 --> 06:42.786
I was just trying
to connect with you.

07:08.442 --> 07:10.409
Oh.

07:34.598 --> 07:35.698
Wow!

07:35.732 --> 07:39.867
Wow. This neighborhood
is unbelievable.

07:39.901 --> 07:42.302
Right? It's almost like
we're not even in Mexico.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.004
Imagine if I really did
become a huge singer

07:45.038 --> 07:47.506
and Tony and I
could afford a place here.

07:47.540 --> 07:49.041
Imagine if all three of us
could.

07:49.075 --> 07:51.009
That's why I booked you
this studio time.

07:51.043 --> 07:54.912
With the right man guiding you
all your dreams can come true.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.174
Yay!

08:02.209 --> 08:05.743
Wow, this is so pro.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.845
Yeah, this, uh, used to be
my parents' bedroom

08:07.879 --> 08:10.013
and now it's a recording studio.
It's really cool.

08:10.047 --> 08:12.282
It's got everything you need
to make an album.

08:12.316 --> 08:14.484
It's got Pro Tools
with two farm cards,

08:14.518 --> 08:16.952
autotone monitors
with DBX compressors.

08:16.986 --> 08:18.520
This is my sound tech,
Estrella.

08:18.554 --> 08:19.854
How are you, man?

08:19.888 --> 08:21.388
Shh. It's okay.

08:21.423 --> 08:23.857
And right here we have,
uh, two booths.

08:23.891 --> 08:25.859
It's got everything you need,
you know,

08:25.893 --> 08:28.328
like computers, candles.

08:28.362 --> 08:30.563
Oh, it's... It's wonderful.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.365
Thank you so much, Sebastian.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.866
You're welcome.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.434
And thank me too. Heh.

08:36.469 --> 08:39.136
So listen, is there
anything that I could, uh...

08:39.171 --> 08:41.639
I can hear or listen to
that, uh...

08:41.673 --> 08:43.674
Uh, I have some sketches.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.842
I was working on something
the other night, but...

08:45.877 --> 08:48.178
Do it.
You should unleash on him.

08:48.212 --> 08:50.446
Show him what
you're working with.

08:50.481 --> 08:53.248
Okay, well, so here I go.

08:55.452 --> 09:00.188
♪ I'm lying here
Watching the stars ♪

09:00.222 --> 09:04.091

That's it. That's it.

09:31.984 --> 09:33.851
I don't even would need
to hear nothing else.

09:33.886 --> 09:35.219
That's the single right there.

09:35.253 --> 09:36.987
Maybe we should hear
a few other things.

09:37.021 --> 09:39.189
Maybe a song about how
a new dude's in your life

09:39.223 --> 09:41.591
and turned your life around.
Maybe something like that.

09:41.625 --> 09:44.026
No, that's gonna pop off
the speakers. That right there.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.462
Can we just try?
Can we, does it hurt to try?

09:46.497 --> 09:48.297
That might be what
you're responding to

09:48.331 --> 09:51.033
is kind of the tempo and shit,
but it's more like:

09:51.067 --> 09:54.469
♪ Be with someone
Who's changing your life ♪

09:54.504 --> 09:56.805
♪And of course Your son's too♪

09:56.840 --> 09:59.007
You know, like something
that's more in that vein.

09:59.041 --> 10:02.211
Okay. Um, I'll try it.
I'll try it.

10:02.245 --> 10:04.346
Um, okay, it's... Okay.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.850
♪ I wanna try with someone ♪
Mm-hm.

10:08.885 --> 10:10.419
♪ Make my life... ♪

10:10.453 --> 10:12.387

10:16.225 --> 10:18.527

10:18.561 --> 10:20.628
It kind of pops. It kind
of pops. That has a pop.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.464
The wording is a little off.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.166
See, the other one
made me happy.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.669
I'm not trying to be the one
who doesn't like the song,

10:27.703 --> 10:29.937
- because I know this is...
- So you like it?

10:29.972 --> 10:32.106
But I don't like it.
But if you guys like it

10:32.140 --> 10:33.274
then let's go with this one.

10:33.308 --> 10:35.175
Who knows? Maybe it'll
end up being a b-side.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.910
Okay.
Who knows?

10:36.945 --> 10:39.812
Come see Kenny fucking Powers

10:39.847 --> 10:42.114
<i>tonight at Charros Stadium.</i>

10:42.149 --> 10:45.817
<i>He's the Hombre Negro,
not the White Flame.</i>

10:45.852 --> 10:49.721
<i>He's not scary like
the negros in America,</i>

10:49.755 --> 10:52.523
unless you're the competition,

10:52.557 --> 10:56.493
then he'll strike you out
and shit all over your face.

10:56.527 --> 11:00.997
Come worship the big dick
American at Charros Stadium.

11:01.031 --> 11:04.233
And hopefully he'll impregnate
all the women here

11:04.267 --> 11:09.337
so we will have a new generation
of Kenny Powerses.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.161
Señor?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.362
What?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.364
They're ready for you.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.069
Make 'em wait.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.304
But I think they're really,
really ready.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.606
I said, make 'em wait.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.875
It's good for 'em.

12:06.232 --> 12:08.633
I'm good.
Let's do this shit.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.935
La Flama Blanca!

12:10.969 --> 12:12.103
<i>La Flama Blanca.</i>

12:12.138 --> 12:14.706
La Flama Blanca!
La Flama Blanca!

12:14.740 --> 12:15.807
<i>La Flama Blanca!</i>

12:21.581 --> 12:23.581
Son of a bitch.

12:35.659 --> 12:37.927
Come on,
get on your fucking feet.

12:37.961 --> 12:39.728
I see you.

12:39.763 --> 12:42.163
Who wants beer? Ha-ha-ha!

12:42.198 --> 12:45.333
You're Mexican.
You all want fucking beer.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.034
Yeah, that's right.

12:47.068 --> 12:48.401
Let's get your asses up.

12:48.436 --> 12:51.404
Cheer for me, people.
Come on, now.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.810
What the fuck are you doing,
Kenny?

12:58.845 --> 13:00.912
Man, come on,
I'm just having some fun.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.613
Get that jackass off the field.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.248
They fucking love this, man.

13:06.985 --> 13:08.352
I'm out?

13:08.386 --> 13:10.454
He wants me out.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.023
He wants me out.

13:13.057 --> 13:15.791
You're costing us a game, man.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.327
They don't like a show
in Mexico, huh?

13:19.361 --> 13:21.496
You guys like a fucking show,
huh?

13:21.530 --> 13:23.931
Fuck you. You poor sport.

13:23.965 --> 13:25.766
Take a beer

14:05.706 --> 14:08.574
Sebastian, can you lower that
high-hat a little bit?

14:08.608 --> 14:09.975
High-hat.
Down. A little.

14:10.009 --> 14:11.676
I thought
it sounded pretty good.

14:11.711 --> 14:13.978
It's overpowering the hook
so let's just drop it

14:14.013 --> 14:16.180
a few dBs please.

Oh, yeah, it's perfect?

14:37.365 --> 14:39.566
It sounds like half
the band fucking quit.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.268
What the fuck are
you laughing at, Estrella?

14:42.302 --> 14:44.937
It's not funny to bury
Vida's wonderful vocals

14:44.972 --> 14:46.772
under your weak-ass samples,
Sebastian.

14:49.141 --> 14:50.942
I think Sebastian
has very good samples.

14:50.976 --> 14:52.610
I think you should
trust him a bit more.

14:52.645 --> 14:54.078
Why are you all
trying to make me out

14:54.112 --> 14:55.513
<i>like I'm Eric Roberts
in Star 80?</i>

14:55.547 --> 14:57.648
I'm not the one who's
fucking possessed here.

14:57.682 --> 14:59.183
I'm trying to make
a good album.

14:59.217 --> 15:01.284
I don't even know
who fucking Eric Roberts is.

15:01.319 --> 15:02.786
Yeah, of course you don't.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.954
Fucking best of the best,
you asshole.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.288
What?

15:06.323 --> 15:08.890
Um, can I talk to you outside?

15:12.027 --> 15:15.162
Don't mess with my presets,
all right? I will check them.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.201
What are you doing in there?
What are you talking about?

15:21.236 --> 15:22.837
I'm trying to make
the album better.

15:22.871 --> 15:24.605
You can't yell
at Sebastian like that.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.174
He's doing us a huge favor
and he's doing it for free.

15:27.208 --> 15:28.508
I see what the problem is here.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.276
It's a classic case of me
believing in you

15:30.310 --> 15:31.944
more than
you're believing in you.

15:31.978 --> 15:33.444
You gotta trust your producer.

15:33.479 --> 15:35.045
With your talent
and my connections,

15:35.079 --> 15:37.814
there is no reason in the world
why this can't go to number one.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.182
Then everybody will know

15:39.217 --> 15:41.484
that Kenny Powers' new
girlfriend is a huge pop star.

15:41.518 --> 15:43.852
This is just going too fast.

15:43.887 --> 15:45.120
Um, Kenny...

15:45.154 --> 15:46.655
Shit!

15:46.689 --> 15:50.425
I just figured out exactly what
the track's missing. Hold up.

15:50.459 --> 15:52.661
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

15:52.695 --> 15:55.463
Fucking remix.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.064
Fucking remix.

15:57.098 --> 15:59.499
Kenny Powers' girlfriend.

15:59.534 --> 16:04.671
Kenny Powers' girlfriend's song.

16:04.705 --> 16:06.673
I like to butt-fuck fine ladies.

16:06.707 --> 16:09.376
Will I choke hold a bitch?
Well, maybe.

16:09.410 --> 16:11.445
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

16:20.151 --> 16:22.118
What the fuck?

16:26.556 --> 16:28.890
No!

16:28.925 --> 16:31.192
I need a personal conference
with His Majesty.

16:31.226 --> 16:33.260
Please exito, assistante. Go.

16:33.294 --> 16:35.362
What do you think you're doing?
This is my office.

16:35.397 --> 16:36.864
What the do you think
you're doing?

16:36.898 --> 16:39.933
Why am I not playing?
I told you if you wanted to play

16:39.967 --> 16:41.434
you were gonna
have to get serious.

16:41.469 --> 16:43.703
You chose to ride a donkey
instead.

16:43.737 --> 16:46.105
Roger, the donkey brought
the whole fucking house down.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.774
Excuse me for fucking giving the
fans what they're asking for.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.710
Kenny, I was rooting for you.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.079
I was hoping you were gonna
turn things around

16:54.113 --> 16:55.747
but at your core,
you don't give a shit.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.915
That's where you're wrong
because I do give a shit.

16:57.949 --> 17:00.349
I mean, how the fuck do you
expect me to make a comeback

17:00.383 --> 17:03.150
from the goddamn bench?
By learning, by practicing.

17:03.184 --> 17:05.484
Not by shucking and jiving
all over the goddamn field.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.420
You racist motherfucker.

17:07.454 --> 17:10.388
Racist! What...?
What are you talking about?

17:10.424 --> 17:11.957
Showing this
jive turkey shit to me!

17:11.992 --> 17:13.791
You gonna talk this
jive turkey shit to me!

17:13.826 --> 17:15.326
Racism, Roger.

17:15.361 --> 17:16.794
You wanna sit me out,
then fine.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.464
But all I'm saying is you better
get the fucking riot gear

17:19.498 --> 17:21.732
because you, my friend,
have invited

17:21.767 --> 17:24.035
a motherfucking revolution.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.469
Revolution?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.069
Fucking believe it.

17:27.104 --> 17:28.171
Hey, Kenny.

17:28.204 --> 17:29.739
Hey, Kenny, where you going?

17:53.159 --> 17:55.993
Hey, hit me up with the ball.

17:56.028 --> 17:57.561
Yeah.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.442
Goddamn.

18:13.476 --> 18:16.111
You mom's really staying out
late tonight, huh?

18:16.145 --> 18:18.513
She stays out past this time
every night.

18:18.547 --> 18:21.482
Till the break of dawn style.
Yeah, I hear you.

18:21.516 --> 18:23.818
But I bet she doesn't do that
too much now, though, huh,

18:23.852 --> 18:24.852
since I'm around?

18:24.886 --> 18:27.254
She did it last night.

18:27.288 --> 18:29.389
Last night?
Yeah.

18:29.423 --> 18:31.024
She was at the studio.

18:31.058 --> 18:32.325
Uh-uh. Not on my watch.

18:32.359 --> 18:34.894
No work is done at the studio
when I'm not there.

18:34.928 --> 18:38.030
Well, she was there last night.

18:39.399 --> 18:41.900
Hm.

18:45.904 --> 18:48.205
Here we are.

18:50.374 --> 18:51.774
All right, Tony.

18:51.808 --> 18:54.376
If we're about to
walk in on what I think,

18:54.410 --> 18:57.144
I'm about to show you how not to
have a creative collaboration.

18:57.178 --> 18:59.313
I just hope Sebastian hasn't
talked your mom out of

18:59.347 --> 19:01.815
giving me that goddamn
executive producer credit.

19:05.420 --> 19:09.189
Oh my, God.
So unprofessional.

19:09.224 --> 19:10.924
Unbelievable.

19:12.827 --> 19:15.595
Oh, shit! Fuck!

19:18.264 --> 19:21.065
What the fuck, Vida?
Close the door, Kenny!

19:21.100 --> 19:23.367
Why, Sebastian? So you can
finish eating her pussy?

19:23.401 --> 19:26.036
Oh, Vida.
Why would you do this to me?

19:26.070 --> 19:28.705
I thought you were the whore
with the heart of gold.

19:28.739 --> 19:31.341
Instead you're just a whore with
a regular old whore's heart.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.876
You don't understand, Kenny.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.578
I need Vida, man.

19:34.612 --> 19:36.213
She can fix me.

19:36.247 --> 19:38.948
Oh, yeah?
See if she can fix this.

19:45.289 --> 19:47.756
There he is.

20:55.144 --> 20:56.745

mission.

20:56.779 --> 20:58.214

20:58.248 --> 20:59.716

20:59.750 --> 21:00.850

or something, man?

21:11.162 --> 21:13.096
Well, yeah. Kind of.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.731
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

21:14.765 --> 21:17.099
She's not her girlfriend.
Break up with her.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.701
Are you kidding?

21:18.735 --> 21:20.368
Stevie,
you're on fucking black ops.

21:20.403 --> 21:22.103
There are no girlfriends
in black ops.

21:22.137 --> 21:23.704
Aren't you dating Vida?

21:23.739 --> 21:25.773
No, I'm not. I dumped her.

21:25.807 --> 21:28.341
And if I had the strength to
dump Vida then you sure as hell

21:28.375 --> 21:30.443
have the strength to dump
Maria's stupid ass.

21:33.179 --> 21:34.612
Kenny,

21:34.647 --> 21:38.015
I will break up with her
if you want

21:38.049 --> 21:40.484
because that is how much
you mean to me,

21:40.518 --> 21:44.988
but please don't make me
do this, okay?

21:45.022 --> 21:47.256
I am begging you.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.359
That is my first
fucking girlfriend.

21:49.393 --> 21:52.995
So fucking please.

21:53.029 --> 21:56.664
I can't allow that wish.
I'm sorry. Dump the bitch.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.834
Dump the bitch.

22:10.211 --> 22:11.845
Maria?

22:11.879 --> 22:14.647
Maria.

22:23.253 --> 22:25.720
Ow! Maria...

22:27.756 --> 22:30.157
Maria.

23:04.129 --> 23:07.631
Who ordered the whore?
Hoo-hoo!

23:07.665 --> 23:10.267
Pizza and pussy!

23:10.302 --> 23:13.469
Who's winning? Oh, we are.

23:13.503 --> 23:15.370
That's a big surprise.
Where are you going?

23:15.404 --> 23:17.038
Roger, shh!
You don't have to do this.

23:17.072 --> 23:18.571
Coming to party.
Stay back here.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.839
Get the fuck off me, Roger.

23:19.873 --> 23:21.240
Hey!

23:21.274 --> 23:22.674
Kenny, you don't
have to do this.

23:22.708 --> 23:26.410
They want this, Roger.
Yeah!

23:26.445 --> 23:28.212
Let's talk about it.

23:28.246 --> 23:30.780
Let's talk about this.
Come on, Kenny.

23:30.815 --> 23:32.382
Quiet, Roger.

23:32.416 --> 23:33.516
Kenny!

23:33.550 --> 23:35.351
U.S.A.!

23:36.687 --> 23:38.621
What up?

23:38.655 --> 23:40.088
Get the fuck out of here, man.

23:40.122 --> 23:42.956
Hey, everybody!

23:42.991 --> 23:45.559
It's your favorite American!

23:47.062 --> 23:49.098
Yeah!

23:51.367 --> 23:52.901
I got something for you.

23:52.935 --> 23:55.070
I'm about to pop out a baby.

23:57.606 --> 24:01.576
Oh, it's a soccer ball! Hey!

24:01.610 --> 24:03.811
You don't have to do this,
Kenny. Come on.

24:03.845 --> 24:05.745
Who likes fucking soccer?

24:05.780 --> 24:08.247
Come on, Kenny.
Take it off the field.

24:11.817 --> 24:14.452
I don't like soccer at all.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.921
Come on, give me that mitt.
Let me shoot something else.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.823
Oh, here we go.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.791
You wanna say something?

24:20.826 --> 24:21.826
Don't think so.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.393
Hey, back up.

24:23.428 --> 24:24.595
Put it down, Kenny.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.764
Fucking, back up.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.967
You think I'm gonna hurt...
Get the fuck back.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.536
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.137
I'm just fucking playing around.

24:32.172 --> 24:34.506
I'm doing a little
fucking dance show.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.808
No, this is for the fans, man.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.444
This is for the fa.
Whoo! For the fans.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.947
She got it. She got it.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.549
Whoo!

24:46.584 --> 24:48.618
Hey, Kenny.

24:52.823 --> 24:54.990
Come on, Kenny.

24:59.229 --> 25:00.896
I quit, Roger!

25:00.931 --> 25:02.531
I fucking quit!

25:02.565 --> 25:04.665
Take it easy. Take it easy.

25:11.804 --> 25:15.372
Hey, brother,
you don't look so good, man.

25:16.708 --> 25:19.409
Can't believe I opened
up my heart to that bitch.

25:19.444 --> 25:21.545
Opened it wide up.

25:21.579 --> 25:24.347
She just squatted with that
big beautiful booty

25:24.381 --> 25:27.450
and dumped all over it.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.752
I'm sorry to hear that,
brother.

25:29.786 --> 25:31.087
Yeah, me too.

25:31.121 --> 25:33.722
You'll meet another girl,
my friend.

25:36.126 --> 25:38.393
But what if I don't, Catuey?

25:39.695 --> 25:41.963
Kenny?

25:42.931 --> 25:44.632
I need to talk to you.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.801
Stevie, I'm having an emotional
crisis right now.

25:46.835 --> 25:49.202
I don't wanna talk to you about
your stupid girlfriend.

25:49.236 --> 25:53.239
I found Eduardo Sanchez.

25:53.273 --> 25:54.740
Bullshit.

25:54.775 --> 25:57.810
He's a hundred miles east of
here in a town called Pachuce.

25:57.844 --> 26:01.813
He's the only gringo
around with that name.

26:03.181 --> 26:06.349
<i>Quien es Eduardo?</i>

26:06.383 --> 26:08.450
Maybe it's time to find out.

26:51.789 --> 26:54.557
Is that him?

27:01.330 --> 27:03.397
I can't tell.

27:11.506 --> 27:13.974
Excuse me.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.910
Excuse me.

27:15.944 --> 27:17.378
Sir?

27:17.412 --> 27:20.982
Are you Eduardo Sanchez?

27:22.116 --> 27:25.251
Depends on who's asking.

27:41.902 --> 27:44.270
Well, hello, Kenny.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.942
Hello, Pop.
