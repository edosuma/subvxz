You have to remember
they're people too.

1:15:08.003 --> 1:15:10.335
They'll make mistakes.

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:13.331
We all do.

1:15:20.182 --> 1:15:22.764
We all have to keep trying.

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:26.472
Isn't that what you said?

1:15:27.606 --> 1:15:29.096
Yeah.

1:15:33.946 --> 1:15:35.607
You know, I only learned to ﬂy...

1:15:35.781 --> 1:15:38.989
...after my kingdom was attacked
and taken from me.

1:15:39.409 --> 1:15:42.697
Was only then that I realized it wasn't
the throne that was important.

1:15:42.913 --> 1:15:44.699
It was my people.

1:15:51.838 --> 1:15:53.214
My wife.

1:15:57.177 --> 1:15:59.839
You have the capacity
to break the chains...

1:16:00.013 --> 1:16:02.425
...that are holding you down, Clark.

1:16:02.808 --> 1:16:04.173
And when you do...

1:16:04.351 --> 1:16:07.684
...what Dr. Fate envisioned
will come to pass.

1:16:09.189 --> 1:16:12.727
You will soar higher
than any one of us.

1:16:14.736 --> 1:16:17.853
What about you?
You gonna keep your wings locked up?

1:16:21.243 --> 1:16:22.699
No.

1:16:24.162 --> 1:16:28.155
No.
No, I am putting people under them.

1:16:29.376 --> 1:16:33.745
Chloe helped Courtney and I locate
the remaining members of the JSA.

1:16:33.922 --> 1:16:37.540
Their children and their protégés.

1:16:38.218 --> 1:16:42.336
I think the coming generation could
stand to learn a thing or two...

1:16:42.514 --> 1:16:44.675
...from those of us
that have done it before.

1:16:45.559 --> 1:16:47.424

Some of us already have.

1:16:50.355 --> 1:16:52.095
Courtney.

The Justice Society lives again.

anyway?

A work in progress.

1:17:23.889 --> 1:17:25.129

1:17:25.307 --> 1:17:28.891
You know, those are some real
party animals you have as friends.

1:17:29.061 --> 1:17:30.892
Ha, ha. If it isn't my favorite Martian.

1:17:31.063 --> 1:17:33.554
Looks like you're enjoying
the return of your powers.

1:17:33.732 --> 1:17:35.393
At a cost.

1:17:35.567 --> 1:17:38.650
Dr. Fate's ﬁnal act
was to restore my Martian abilities...

1:17:38.820 --> 1:17:41.311
...instead of saving his own life.

1:17:41.531 --> 1:17:44.273
-What happens to the helmet now?
-According to Hawkman...

1:17:44.451 --> 1:17:48.490
...someone worthy will be drawn to it,
and they'll become the next Dr. Fate.

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:54.166
My time as a detective has allowed me
to protect humans...

1:17:54.336 --> 1:17:58.579
...on a very personal and individual level.
I've enjoyed that.

1:18:00.175 --> 1:18:03.793
So I will continue to protect and serve,
using every tool I've got.

1:18:05.097 --> 1:18:06.177
Me too.

1:18:09.184 --> 1:18:15.020
Dr. Fate was inundated with a constant
ﬂow of visions and information.

1:18:15.190 --> 1:18:18.853
But there is a limit to how much
knowledge someone can have.

1:18:19.152 --> 1:18:23.361
It drove him to the edge of sanity,
and he fell off.

1:18:23.532 --> 1:18:26.444
I don't need my telepathy to know
you run that risk yourself.

1:18:26.618 --> 1:18:29.610
The golden helmet possessed
by ancient spirits and the Watchtower...

1:18:29.788 --> 1:18:32.370
...are two entirely different things.
I can handle it.

1:18:36.211 --> 1:18:39.578
I only say because I care.

1:18:40.215 --> 1:18:44.083
You and Clark, Oliver....

1:18:57.107 --> 1:18:58.472
Nothing, actually.

1:19:00.652 --> 1:19:04.395
Ha, ha. I, uh, thought I'd stop by
and see if anyone was hungry.

1:19:05.157 --> 1:19:07.819
I could use some dinner. Chloe?

1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:14.913
Uh, sure.

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.664
You're buying, Mr. Queen.

1:19:17.210 --> 1:19:20.748
JONES: I'm living off a policeman's salary.
-All right. Fine. Dessert's on you.

1:19:20.922 --> 1:19:22.753
On Mars, we never had dessert.

1:19:22.924 --> 1:19:26.166
But I have grown
especially fond of cookies.

1:19:40.901 --> 1:19:44.610
-Front page, Clark.
-Hey, congratulations.

1:19:44.780 --> 1:19:48.193
It's hard to believe that a group of
underdogs can be swept under the rug.

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:51.733
At least, thanks to you, the world
now knows who these heroes are.

1:19:51.912 --> 1:19:54.244
Hopefully,
we'll be seeing more of them.

1:19:54.414 --> 1:19:58.703

"Lois Lane and Clark Kent."

-Next time.
-Maybe.

It's not everyday that you get an exclusive
with a helmet that can tell you your fate.

1:20:13.308 --> 1:20:16.971
So he told you your fate?

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:18.973
Huh?

1:20:21.566 --> 1:20:25.900
Yeah, he was just babbling
about how I'd be there for him.

1:20:26.071 --> 1:20:28.153
And he'd be there for me. It just--

1:20:28.323 --> 1:20:30.780
Sounded like a Valentine's Day card.

Who's the him?

1:20:34.496 --> 1:20:36.407
It's ridiculous.

1:20:36.581 --> 1:20:40.199
I quote, "Savior/sentient power."

1:20:44.339 --> 1:20:46.000

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:36.221
What Checkmate started.

1:21:36.391 --> 1:21:39.724
I can still take down the JSA
single-handedly.

1:21:39.895 --> 1:21:41.851
You knocked on their door.

1:21:42.022 --> 1:21:46.391
You got them back into the game,
back into the public eye.
