00:15.010 --> 00:17.845
- You have a son.
- Yeah. Will.

00:17.879 --> 00:20.014
- What about his mom?
- She died when he was three.

00:20.048 --> 00:22.016
- I'm sorry.
- Are you Mingo?

00:22.050 --> 00:24.752
- What can I do for ya?
- You can start by apologizing

00:24.786 --> 00:27.021
- for blowing up our bathroom.
- Play you for it.

00:28.890 --> 00:30.724
I guess what I'm saying is...

00:31.760 --> 00:35.596
Both Tank and I made mistakes.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.264
If we're gonna get past this,

00:37.265 --> 00:40.392
I need you to know the
truth and be okay with it.

00:40.393 --> 00:42.520
_

00:43.405 --> 00:44.772
I am this close to losing
my kid to foster care.

00:44.806 --> 00:46.774
- And if I'm supposed to care...
- I know you have it way worse.

00:46.808 --> 00:49.476
What is it with your two?
You think I give a rat's ass

00:49.511 --> 00:51.645
you have a kid waiting for you back
at whatever pit you crawled out of?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.280
I don't.

00:54.676 --> 00:57.511
- So whatever happened with Tank?
- I told the truth

00:57.545 --> 00:59.613
and they expelled him.

00:59.647 --> 01:01.582
Payback's a bitch.

01:01.616 --> 01:05.152
I heard that he had to move back
home with his dad for the semester.

01:05.186 --> 01:09.089
I'm just so ready for this
whole mess to be over with...

01:09.124 --> 01:11.125
Tank, community service, all of it.

01:11.159 --> 01:13.460
- How many more days you got?
- 19,

01:13.495 --> 01:16.029
and then 97 more of probation

01:16.064 --> 01:17.998
and then I am a free woman.

01:18.032 --> 01:19.399
- (Cellphone ringing)
- Lucky you.

01:19.434 --> 01:22.136
Crap. It's my aunt. She's watching Sam.

01:22.170 --> 01:23.270
Hey, is he okay?

01:25.006 --> 01:27.241
What? You said you could
watch him till 4:00.

01:27.275 --> 01:29.276
No, I can't leave early.

01:29.310 --> 01:32.880
Come on. Don't do this to me, please.

01:35.116 --> 01:38.118
Kennish, get to work
painting over that graffiti.

01:38.153 --> 01:39.820
Whitewash is in the van.

01:41.022 --> 01:43.957
Hey, Gordon, can I talk to you

01:43.992 --> 01:46.593
- for a second?
- Talk about what?

01:46.628 --> 01:47.961
I'll clean up more dead rats.

01:47.996 --> 01:49.863
I will weed for eight hours straight.

01:49.898 --> 01:52.733
Just please don't make me paint over that.

01:54.502 --> 01:56.637
- Why not?
- Because it's art.

01:56.671 --> 01:59.606
(Scoffs) I don't care
if it's the Mona Lisa.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.608
I told you to paint over it.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.378
Okay, could you just stop and...

02:04.412 --> 02:07.247
and look at it for a second

02:07.282 --> 02:09.383
and try to see it for what it really is?

02:09.417 --> 02:12.352
An artist trying to make people

02:12.387 --> 02:13.620
see something differently.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.589
Get it done, or I'm writing you up.

02:17.292 --> 02:18.458
As a fellow street artist,

02:18.493 --> 02:20.494
I cannot, in good conscience,
defile someone else's work.

02:20.528 --> 02:22.196
News flash, young lady:

02:22.230 --> 02:24.231
You're not an artist, you're a convict.

02:24.265 --> 02:26.066
Now get to it, or I'll make sure they add

02:26.100 --> 02:27.301
another hundred hours to your sentence!

02:27.335 --> 02:30.137
I do not understand why
you have to be such a jerk.

02:30.171 --> 02:32.339
I have done everything
that you have asked of me,

02:32.373 --> 02:34.274
and you go out of your way to be rude.

02:34.309 --> 02:36.243
And by the way, I don't think
you have any power to add...

02:36.277 --> 02:38.078
- (choking)
- Are you okay?

02:38.112 --> 02:39.980
What? Are you... oh!

02:40.014 --> 02:41.915
Oh, you're choking. You're totally choking.

02:41.950 --> 02:43.884
Okay. Okay. It's okay.

02:43.918 --> 02:45.986
My sister taught me the
Heimlich maneuver. Just... okay.

02:47.121 --> 02:49.122
- (Coughing)
- Okay.

02:53.862 --> 02:56.530
Okay. You... you okay?

02:56.564 --> 02:57.564
Hey. Okay.

03:00.902 --> 03:03.537
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

03:05.607 --> 03:06.840
Get back to work!

03:08.810 --> 03:10.477
Now!

03:17.652 --> 03:18.952
What's going on?

03:20.922 --> 03:22.589
19 more days.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.619
that I saved the Golden

Only took me three
straight days of excess rush

03:57.025 --> 03:58.859
and pizza... food of the gods.

03:58.893 --> 04:02.496
Well, the Golden Gate is a
miracle of modern engineering.

04:02.530 --> 04:03.931
You couldn't let it go
down without a fight.

04:04.055 --> 04:06.890
Finally, a woman who understands me.

04:06.924 --> 04:08.892
Lucky for you,

04:08.926 --> 04:10.994
the storm didn't knock
out the dorm's power.

04:11.029 --> 04:14.564
- There was a storm?
- Are you kidding?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.833
Yes, he is.

If you're free tonight, I know
about this party over at Campus View.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.691
Sounds great.

04:34.725 --> 04:36.660
Cool. I'll text you.

04:41.966 --> 04:45.001
That is going to be a total waste of time.

04:45.036 --> 04:47.771
- What?
- Coach Walsh wants to spend

04:47.805 --> 04:49.773
another practice watching film.

04:49.807 --> 04:52.742
What those boys need are
fielding fundamentals,

04:52.777 --> 04:54.111
not more sitting on their butts.

04:54.145 --> 04:56.746
It's not easy going from player to coach.

No, it's fine. Come on.

05:09.961 --> 05:13.663

exercises that I showed you?

05:13.664 --> 05:19.804

05:19.837 --> 05:20.937

05:25.042 --> 05:27.744
Uh-huh. Let's see what we can do here.

05:27.778 --> 05:31.715
<i>"Analyze the communist
manifesto by Karl Marx.</i>

05:31.749 --> 05:34.885
In your essay, take a critical
and well-informed position

05:34.919 --> 05:38.889
and argue a particular
interpretation of the text."

05:40.892 --> 05:43.660
Yeah. I would love to help,

05:43.694 --> 05:47.731
but communism and writing... not my...

05:47.765 --> 05:51.067
Ah! But this fine lady
is a literary genius.

05:51.102 --> 05:52.702
- (Clears throat)
- (Scoffs)

05:52.737 --> 05:54.037
Someone is trying to butter me up.

05:54.071 --> 05:55.939
Would you mind reading

05:55.973 --> 05:58.608
one of Travis' school papers?

05:58.643 --> 06:00.977
And maybe giving him
some of your expertise?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.879
I'd be happy to.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.630
_

06:05.636 --> 06:07.884
I save the guy's life, and he writes me up.

06:07.919 --> 06:10.612
Unbelievable. You know, for the record,

06:10.613 --> 06:12.993
Gordon is a sexist, condescending ass-hat.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.629
Which makes it all the more surprising

06:14.630 --> 06:16.459
that he recommended you be released early

06:16.494 --> 06:18.468
- for good behavior.
- He what?

06:18.563 --> 06:21.665
Seems that saving his life
did a number on his conscience.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.242
- Oh.
- And based on my experience

06:24.277 --> 06:26.378
with you, I seconded the idea.

06:26.412 --> 06:30.248
So, "released," what
does that mean, exactly?

06:30.283 --> 06:32.417
You won't have to finish
your remaining 19 days.

06:32.451 --> 06:35.353
- Oh my god.
- I also recommended to the judge

06:35.388 --> 06:38.089
that your remaining days
of probation be rescinded.

06:38.124 --> 06:42.027
So I'm free? I'm like totally free?

06:42.061 --> 06:43.962
I can travel. I can go wherever I want?

06:43.996 --> 06:45.964
- Have at it.
- Yes!

06:45.998 --> 06:47.265
Oh, thank you, thank you,

06:47.300 --> 06:49.134
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

06:49.168 --> 06:52.003
Just promise me your name
won't ever cross my desk again.

06:52.038 --> 06:54.806
Never. You have my word.

06:56.142 --> 06:58.810
Oh, here, let me help.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.881
- Thanks.
- Oh. Wow. What do you got in here?

07:02.915 --> 07:04.090
My books.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.750
You must be the best-read kid
this side of the Mississippi.

07:08.588 --> 07:09.688
- Hey.
- Morning.

07:09.722 --> 07:11.656
- Morning.
- What's all this?

07:11.691 --> 07:13.225
- Going on a trip?
- (Chuckles)

07:13.226 --> 07:15.795
The roof's been leaking
like a sieve since the storm.

07:15.861 --> 07:17.796
We need to move to a
motel while it gets fixed.

07:17.830 --> 07:20.565
- Which sucks.
- Will. Language.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.501
- Well, how long you out for?
- The estimate says two days,

07:23.536 --> 07:24.703
which probably means four.

07:25.705 --> 07:28.506
Where's your backpack? Go
back up and get it, please.

07:28.541 --> 07:31.476
- Can't you?
- No, dude, you do it.

07:31.510 --> 07:35.447
- What's got into you today?
- We've been in 19 motels since kindergarten.

07:35.481 --> 07:38.049
- 19.
- So?

07:38.084 --> 07:41.319
- So they're disgusting.
- Will, enough.

07:41.321 --> 07:42.957
You could stay with me.

07:45.992 --> 07:48.026
Daphne is away at school,

07:48.060 --> 07:49.961
and you two could stay in her room.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.064
- Beats a motel room.
- Yeah!

07:53.099 --> 07:55.100
No. No, seriously.

07:55.134 --> 07:57.902
- We weren't fishing for an invite.
- I know you weren't.

07:57.937 --> 07:59.938
But I'd like to help.

07:59.972 --> 08:02.107
Besides, it's just for a couple of nights.

08:02.141 --> 08:05.043
- Come on, dad. Please.
- (Scoffs)

08:06.879 --> 08:08.813
- All right.
- Great.

08:15.075 --> 08:16.809
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:16.843 --> 08:19.512
- You have a sec?
- Oh yeah, sure.

08:20.781 --> 08:23.449
- Everything okay?
- I'm reading this paper

08:23.483 --> 08:25.251
that Travis wrote for school,

08:25.285 --> 08:28.287
and to be Frank, I can't
believe how bad it is.

08:28.322 --> 08:30.256
It's not uncommon for deaf kids.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.457
Remember, English is his second language.

08:32.491 --> 08:35.561
A.S.L. grammar has more in
common with Chinese than English.

08:35.596 --> 08:38.130
Well, how did Daphne manage?

08:38.164 --> 08:42.101
'Cause I was on her. Every night
before bed I made her read 20 pages.

08:42.135 --> 08:44.203
And then, after school,
the two of us would sit down

08:44.238 --> 08:46.372
with her homework and
review every single word.

08:46.406 --> 08:49.342
Nurturing and positive reinforcement,

08:49.376 --> 08:52.245
neither of which Travis had growing up.

08:52.279 --> 08:55.748
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

08:55.782 --> 08:58.718
Um, you needed something?

08:58.752 --> 09:01.087
Yes, I...

09:01.121 --> 09:04.123
invited my business partner and his son

09:04.157 --> 09:06.993
to stay with me for a few days
while their roof is being repaired.

09:07.027 --> 09:09.962
- I hope it's okay.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

09:09.997 --> 09:12.665
It's your home too.

09:12.699 --> 09:16.736
Um, actually, Eric and
I are sort of involved.

09:16.770 --> 09:20.640
- Oh?
- I know.

09:21.708 --> 09:23.409
Good for you.

09:23.443 --> 09:25.745
The invitation came out of my mouth
before I'd even thought it through.

09:25.779 --> 09:27.713
So?

09:27.748 --> 09:29.615
Is it like we're playing house?

09:29.650 --> 09:31.717
I hadn't gone there, but clearly you have.

09:31.752 --> 09:33.386
I'm overthinking it.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.722
What if he hates the way
I look in the morning?

09:36.757 --> 09:38.658
What if we drive each other nuts?

09:38.692 --> 09:40.660
- What if...
- What if, what if.

09:40.694 --> 09:42.428
(Chuckles) At least you'll know.

09:43.430 --> 09:45.331
Right. Right.

09:45.365 --> 09:48.301
Can you believe it? I'm finally free

09:48.335 --> 09:52.238
to go to L.A., and the
timing could not be worse.

09:52.272 --> 09:54.307
Have you spoken to Emmett
since he's been gone?

09:54.341 --> 09:56.409
No. I'm giving him space,

09:56.443 --> 09:58.978
and hopefully he'll figure things out,

09:59.012 --> 10:01.080
and then come to me when he's ready.

10:01.114 --> 10:03.182
He loves you. He will.

10:03.216 --> 10:05.117
Well, in the meantime,

10:05.152 --> 10:08.187
I get to decide what I'm gonna
do with my newfound freedom.

10:08.221 --> 10:11.057
Have you considered
reapplying for art school?

10:11.091 --> 10:13.893
Probably couldn't start until the fall.

10:14.895 --> 10:16.729
What do you think? First date.

10:16.763 --> 10:20.833
I would go a little more... vavoom.

10:22.069 --> 10:24.070
What about getting a job job?

10:24.104 --> 10:26.806
I just wish I could find a way

10:26.840 --> 10:28.841
for art to be my job.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.878
What about that artist showcase
you were up for a while back?

10:32.913 --> 10:34.880
The one that I got disqualified from

10:34.915 --> 10:38.751
- for having a criminal record?
- Yeah, but the woman loved your work.

10:38.785 --> 10:41.487
Maybe she has another
showcase you could apply for.

10:41.521 --> 10:42.621
Hm-mmm.

10:43.623 --> 10:46.726
You know what? That is not a terrible idea.

10:47.761 --> 10:49.528
How about this one?

10:49.563 --> 10:52.298
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.502
Nice digs. (Whistles)

10:56.536 --> 11:00.072
(Chuckles) I live on
this side of the driveway.

11:00.107 --> 11:02.174
Oh, damn, because I was about to propose.

11:02.209 --> 11:05.311
- (Laughs)
- Hey, need some help.

11:05.345 --> 11:07.413
John Kennish, this is Eric Bishop

11:07.447 --> 11:10.883
- and this is Will.
- Hello, Will, Eric.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.017
Hey, thanks for letting us stay here.

11:12.052 --> 11:13.319
Oh, it's Regina you need to thank.

11:13.353 --> 11:15.955
- She know how grateful we are.
- John: How old are you, Will?

11:15.989 --> 11:18.224
- Nine.
- You're nine. Outstanding.

11:18.258 --> 11:21.026
This looks like a
nine-year-old backpack to me.

11:21.061 --> 11:22.795
- There you go.
- (Men chuckle)

11:22.829 --> 11:24.063
That your Porsche down the drive?

11:24.097 --> 11:26.665
- Yes, it is.
- She's a beauty.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.034
I was lucky enough to
drive a Carrera G.T. once.

11:29.069 --> 11:31.737
John: No kidding? Didn't
they just make 1200 of those?

11:31.772 --> 11:33.939
Eric: Yep, worked for a
Porsche mechanic in San Fran.

11:33.974 --> 11:35.941
A tech client had one,
let me take it for a spin.

11:35.976 --> 11:40.546
"A revolution happened
and a new class appeared."

11:41.447 --> 11:46.875
_

11:46.887 --> 11:47.787
Right.

11:48.208 --> 11:54.551
_

11:54.628 --> 11:55.628
I know.

11:58.183 --> 12:02.231
_

12:03.082 --> 12:05.622
_

12:06.123 --> 12:08.694
_

12:08.905 --> 12:14.203
_

12:14.204 --> 12:15.930
_

12:16.116 --> 12:18.451
A.S.L. is, hands down,

12:18.485 --> 12:21.053
one of the coolest
languages in the whole world,

12:21.087 --> 12:23.389
but you still have to learn

12:23.423 --> 12:27.092
how to read and write English fluently.

12:28.103 --> 12:34.160
_

12:34.165 --> 12:37.002
You have to write cover
letters and résumés.

12:37.003 --> 12:38.003
_

12:38.004 --> 12:39.576
_

12:39.840 --> 12:42.741
You don't know that! You have
to keep your options open.

12:42.742 --> 12:45.556
_

12:46.847 --> 12:50.883
Any time you write anything
to a hearing person...

12:50.917 --> 12:54.653
an email, a tweet, I don't care what it is,

12:54.688 --> 12:57.523
you are gonna sound uneducated

12:57.557 --> 13:00.693
if you use the wrong tense.

13:01.862 --> 13:05.331
And you are never gonna learn

13:05.365 --> 13:08.367
if you have the attitude
that it's stupid. Now come on.

13:09.603 --> 13:11.670
Let's try another paragraph.

13:13.271 --> 13:16.871
_

13:16.876 --> 13:19.545
Okay. I'll see you on Thursday?

13:23.517 --> 13:24.483
(Sighs)

13:26.353 --> 13:29.221
- Where's my room?
- Our room.

13:29.256 --> 13:30.956
First door on your right.

13:32.158 --> 13:34.894
(Sighs) Well, I'll let you get settled in.

13:34.928 --> 13:36.195
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

13:36.229 --> 13:38.330
If you want, I can check on
that engine light for you.

13:38.365 --> 13:41.100
- That would be great. Thank you.
- All right.

13:45.839 --> 13:48.841
Huh! I am impressed.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.010
It took me three years
to win over John Kennish,

13:51.044 --> 13:53.712
and you went from zero to 60 in 10 seconds.

13:53.747 --> 13:54.980
(Chuckles)

13:58.785 --> 14:00.853
- Angelo?
- Yeah.

14:02.522 --> 14:04.823
You can ask me anything you want about him.

14:04.858 --> 14:08.460
I'm good. That's in the past.

14:08.495 --> 14:10.696
Okay, but to be honest,

14:10.730 --> 14:13.766
I wouldn't mind knowing a
little bit more about your wife.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.668
That's in the past, too.

14:17.537 --> 14:18.637
I better check on Will.

14:21.374 --> 14:22.308
Hm.

14:26.546 --> 14:30.182
He said he'd text me. You
heard him say that, right?

14:30.216 --> 14:36.121
- Maybe it's a late party?
- I have officially become "that girl."

14:36.156 --> 14:39.158
I'm waiting by my phone
for some guy to text me.

14:39.192 --> 14:41.060
(Sighs)

14:42.195 --> 14:45.164
- Do you think I should text him?
- I'm no expert,

14:45.198 --> 14:48.100
but it's empowering to make the first move.

14:48.134 --> 14:50.202
Do you know what? You're right.

14:50.236 --> 14:53.772
I'll just text him to confirm our plans.

14:53.807 --> 14:56.075
That's totally reasonable.

14:56.109 --> 14:59.645
Also, you should make a typo to
make it look like you don't care.

14:59.679 --> 15:02.815
No way. I refuse to misspell.

15:02.849 --> 15:04.617
(Clicking)

15:05.952 --> 15:08.380
- Hmm?
- _

15:10.523 --> 15:12.625
- What?
- It's just...

15:12.659 --> 15:15.561
You might wanna lose the question mark,

15:15.595 --> 15:18.464
so you don't seem too desperate.

15:18.498 --> 15:19.765
(Sighs)

15:19.766 --> 15:20.830
_

15:20.834 --> 15:22.534
- Here goes.
- (Whooshes)

15:26.539 --> 15:28.540
Ah! This is ridiculous!

15:28.575 --> 15:31.243
We are not just sitting here.

15:31.277 --> 15:32.611
- Come on, we're going out.
- Where?

15:32.646 --> 15:35.547
I don't know. A movie? Anywhere.

15:35.582 --> 15:37.316
- (Cellphone buzzes)
- Oh!

15:37.350 --> 15:39.118
(Sighs) It's not him.

15:41.354 --> 15:43.188
He just posted a photo.

15:48.962 --> 15:50.963
Does that mean...?

15:50.997 --> 15:53.899
He went to the party without me.

15:53.933 --> 15:56.935
So, since I'm finished
paying my debt to society,

15:56.970 --> 15:58.971
I was hoping that you might have

15:59.005 --> 16:00.839
another showcase I could apply for.

16:00.874 --> 16:04.910
I'm sorry. All of our installations are
booked through the next calendar year.

16:04.944 --> 16:07.913
What about a job here at the
Kansas City Arts Alliance?

16:07.947 --> 16:10.716
I could be an assistant to someone

16:10.750 --> 16:12.885
- or an assistant to an assistant.
- (Sighs)

16:12.919 --> 16:14.887
We can barely afford the
staff we already have.

16:14.921 --> 16:17.856
- I could intern.
- We're not an employment agency.

16:17.891 --> 16:19.692
(Sighs)

16:20.694 --> 16:23.529
I've had to put art on the
back burner for so long,

16:23.563 --> 16:26.732
and I just wanna find a way for
it to be a part of my life again.

16:26.766 --> 16:29.802
- Full-time.
- My advice?

16:29.836 --> 16:34.406
Stop looking for opportunities
and start making your own.

16:34.441 --> 16:37.476
You're an artist. Create.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.514
- Ooh!
- Hey, it is freezing out here.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.717
- No, we're okay.
- Oh, come on, he's gonna catch a cold.

16:50.751 --> 16:53.252
- Stop 30 seconds.
- (Sighs)

16:53.287 --> 16:55.188
I got this.

16:56.490 --> 16:58.458
Oh! Wait.

16:58.492 --> 17:00.393
- (Laughter)
- We can do it. We can do it.

17:00.427 --> 17:02.562
There! Better?

17:02.596 --> 17:04.130
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:04.164 --> 17:05.464
- Thanks.
- Hey, what do you guys want for dinner?

17:05.499 --> 17:08.300
I can do trout almondine
or spaghetti and meatballs.

17:08.335 --> 17:11.104
- Meatballs.
- I figured.

17:11.137 --> 17:12.438
No, no, listen, you
don't have to cater to us.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.107
- Whatever's easiest.
- I'm happy to do it.

17:14.141 --> 17:16.041
It'll be nice. We'll have dinner together.

17:17.310 --> 17:20.046
- All right, Coach.
- All you.

17:23.983 --> 17:25.218
- Right, 'cause...
- Hey, Red!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.819
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:27.855 --> 17:30.056
Vimla, Mingo. Mingo, Vimla.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.059
- Hi.
- Missed you at the party last night.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.896
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I waited for you like forever.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.033
- I was waiting for you to text me.
- We said we'd meet there.

17:40.067 --> 17:43.569
No, you said you'd text
me, and when you didn't,

17:43.604 --> 17:44.971
I texted you, and you never replied.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.809
Huh. There it is. I must've missed it.

17:51.712 --> 17:53.832
- It's fine.
- How about we hang out tonight?

17:53.833 --> 17:54.833
Catch a movie?

17:55.716 --> 17:57.483
Come on, tell me you have
something more fun planned.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.456
- What time?
- I'll text you.

18:03.490 --> 18:06.125
I'm kidding. 8:00, my room?

18:07.127 --> 18:09.228
- I'll see you then.
- Yes, you will.

18:13.067 --> 18:17.003
- He's hot.
- (Both laugh)

18:17.037 --> 18:19.405
I don't know. Last night was
supposed to be our first date,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.042
but... well, you heard.
I just don't get it.

18:23.077 --> 18:24.277
He acts like he wants to hang out,

18:24.311 --> 18:27.046
but it has taken him weeks to ask me out.

18:27.081 --> 18:28.881
And when he finally does,

18:28.916 --> 18:31.884
he posts a photo of him
blasted with two other girls.

18:31.919 --> 18:33.252
Nobody dates in college.

18:33.287 --> 18:36.122
- That's not true.
- One night stands or friends with benefits,

18:36.156 --> 18:38.691
- those are your choices.
- Ouch.

18:38.725 --> 18:42.095
Why? Embrace it. It means that
women are just as empowered as guys

18:42.129 --> 18:44.931
to have this time and space
to focus on their future

18:44.965 --> 18:46.933
while still fulfilling our sexual needs.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.602
So you and Josh...

18:49.636 --> 18:51.537
He's number four.

18:51.572 --> 18:54.440
My point is, if you are
attracted to this guy,

18:54.475 --> 18:56.609
don't overthink it. Just relax,

18:56.643 --> 18:59.378
have fun. That's what he's doing.

19:11.658 --> 19:15.128
- Here's the hero.
- Oh, come on.

19:15.162 --> 19:16.496
- Ear they released you.
- They did.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.498
So what are you doing back here?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.366
I came to bring someone

19:20.400 --> 19:22.301
a heroin-laced turkey sandwich.

19:22.336 --> 19:25.071
- Not funny.
- Sorry.

19:25.105 --> 19:28.007
Actually, I wanted to return this to you.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.109
Thanks.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.248
And... I wanted to say hi.

19:35.282 --> 19:38.217
- See how you're doing.
- Why?

19:38.252 --> 19:42.054
(Scoffs) Really? You can't just
be happy for me that I got out?

19:42.089 --> 19:44.991
(Scoffs) Congratulations. Have a nice life.

19:45.025 --> 19:48.094
Wow. Okay. Hey, you know what?

19:51.064 --> 19:52.899
I actually thought we were friends,

19:52.933 --> 19:56.802
but it's pretty clear that you
don't care about anyone but yourself.

19:56.837 --> 19:59.605
You have got a ton of nerve.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.874
You say we're friends, but you
don't know the first thing about me.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.477
All you do is moan and
groan about your own life,

20:04.511 --> 20:07.580
so forgive me if I don't want to play
a part in some big phony send-off.

20:08.682 --> 20:09.815
So tell me.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.455
- You don't wanna know.
- Yes, I do.

20:17.724 --> 20:22.595
Fine. Yesterday when my aunt
couldn't watch Sam anymore,

20:22.629 --> 20:25.264
I had to take him to work,
this telemarketing gig

20:25.299 --> 20:27.333
in some dude's disgusting basement.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.369
He said I couldn't bring
Sam, I said I had no choice.

20:30.404 --> 20:32.205
And so he fired me.

20:32.239 --> 20:36.409
So good luck to me trying to find
a new job with a criminal record.

20:38.245 --> 20:41.013
I can barely afford Sam's medical bills,

20:41.048 --> 20:42.949
forget even thinking about
any of the new treatments.

20:42.983 --> 20:45.284
Whoa. Wait. What's wrong with Sam?

20:45.319 --> 20:48.020
One of his heart valves is defective.

20:50.057 --> 20:54.093
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.
- Yeah, well, now you do.

21:03.035 --> 21:06.809
- So, how long have you known?
- Since he was born.

21:08.841 --> 21:12.177
But how does it... what exactly does...

21:12.211 --> 21:15.847
He has a failure to thrive,

21:15.882 --> 21:18.917
which basically means he's so puny

21:18.951 --> 21:21.720
he doesn't even make it onto
the height and weight charts.

21:21.819 --> 21:25.856
He doesn't eat much.
He tires out real fast.

21:27.692 --> 21:30.694
All of the other moms are
complaining about their kids.

21:30.728 --> 21:33.663
"I can't keep up with
him. He's into everything."

21:33.698 --> 21:36.533
Meanwhile I am begging Sam,

21:36.567 --> 21:38.735
"come on, honey, let's go to the park."

21:38.769 --> 21:40.437
"Let's run."

21:41.439 --> 21:42.506
And then he does...

21:43.674 --> 21:46.409
and I'm terrified he's
gonna stop breathing.

21:49.514 --> 21:52.482
I am so tired of worrying about him,

21:52.517 --> 21:54.684
and freaking out about his future.

21:54.719 --> 21:58.555
Terrified of all the things
he's not gonna be able to do.

22:01.225 --> 22:03.527
Seriously, this kid is such a burden...

22:06.230 --> 22:08.565
(Crying) and I love him so much.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.140
Uh, need you back to work, Tess.

22:17.174 --> 22:19.175
Yeah, coming.

22:21.178 --> 22:22.946
(Sighs)

22:22.980 --> 22:34.533
Well, what can you do, right?

22:34.568 --> 22:35.723
So, did you have a movie in mind?

22:35.870 --> 22:37.537
I'm a big horror fan.

22:38.259 --> 22:40.094
Actually...

22:40.128 --> 22:42.229
I was kinda thinking we'd
watch one here instead.

22:42.263 --> 22:43.364
Oh.

22:44.966 --> 22:47.101
- Sure.
- Excellent.

22:48.136 --> 22:50.304
(Both laugh)

22:51.940 --> 22:55.976
- A heart defect?
- Yeah, he's on a bunch of different medications.

22:56.010 --> 22:57.911
And Tess said that if he gets any worse,

22:57.946 --> 22:59.179
he's probably gonna have to have surgery.

22:59.214 --> 23:01.148
Is there anything we can do to help?

23:01.182 --> 23:04.785
I thought about buying her groceries,
but I don't think she'd take them.

23:04.819 --> 23:07.988
- Can you think of anything?
- It's such thankless work,

23:08.022 --> 23:10.758
the day in, day out of parenting.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.061
Sometimes just the smallest
acknowledgment from a person

23:14.095 --> 23:16.930
that you're doing a good job.

23:16.965 --> 23:18.899
What do you mean?

23:18.933 --> 23:20.968
I remember this one time,

23:21.002 --> 23:23.904
you were probably two, Toby was three,

23:23.938 --> 23:26.907
we were on the road to
visit your dad in Chicago.

23:26.941 --> 23:29.777
And we stopped at a rest stop,

23:29.811 --> 23:30.911
and you were on the changing table.

23:30.945 --> 23:32.780
And you were kicking
and screaming and crying,

23:32.814 --> 23:35.749
and Toby was whining
about how his stomach hurt.

23:35.784 --> 23:37.785
And I kept saying,
"you're fine, you're fine."

23:38.787 --> 23:40.521
And the second we got outside,

23:40.555 --> 23:43.524
he threw up all over
everything. The poor thing.

23:43.558 --> 23:47.494
And I felt like the worst
mom on the whole planet.

23:47.529 --> 23:50.597
And this woman was passing by and she said,

23:52.233 --> 23:53.300
"you're doing great."

23:54.402 --> 23:58.138
And I don't know, that
moment just lifted me.

23:59.441 --> 24:02.476
So, just tell her she's doing a good job?

24:02.510 --> 24:03.510
That's it?

24:03.545 --> 24:05.379
May not seem like much,

24:05.413 --> 24:07.181
but it means a lot.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.568
<i>Kathryn: John, we have a problem.</i>

25:02.604 --> 25:05.472
I just read Travis' rewrite of his paper.

25:05.507 --> 25:06.607
That bad, huh?

25:06.641 --> 25:08.775
Actually, it's really good.

25:08.810 --> 25:11.512
And that is a problem why?

25:12.514 --> 25:13.580
It's too good.

25:25.493 --> 25:26.493
What do you want?

25:27.529 --> 25:30.264
I hope size three's okay.

25:30.298 --> 25:32.366
Who knew that diapers had sizes?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.167
I don't need your charity.

25:34.202 --> 25:36.203
It's not charity.

25:36.237 --> 25:38.238
Um, hopefully it's more like a trade.

25:40.141 --> 25:41.208
I need your help.

25:41.242 --> 25:42.276
Sam's too.

25:42.310 --> 25:45.012
Dude, move in, why don't you?

25:45.046 --> 25:47.948
(Chuckles) It's fine, I love
having his things around.

25:47.982 --> 25:49.316
- See?
- (Clicks tongue) Eh.

25:49.350 --> 25:52.119
Besides, I have to admit
I'm a bit of a slob myself.

25:52.153 --> 25:54.187
My daughter, Daphne, has
put up with it for years.

25:54.222 --> 25:56.189
But when my other daughter,
Bay and I, live together

25:56.224 --> 25:59.026
we are like two peas in a very messy pod.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.160
(Chuckles)

26:00.194 --> 26:02.095
Regina's daughters were
accidentally switched

26:02.130 --> 26:03.830
at the hospital when they were born.

26:03.865 --> 26:05.799
So... she has two daughters.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.167
And they both have two moms.

26:07.201 --> 26:08.735
That's lucky.

26:08.770 --> 26:10.671
What is? Having two moms?

26:10.705 --> 26:11.772
I don't have any.

26:11.806 --> 26:13.040
All right. (Sighs)

26:13.074 --> 26:14.808
Come on, time for bed.

26:14.842 --> 26:16.076
- I'm not tired.
- I don't care.

26:16.110 --> 26:17.611
It's bedtime.

26:17.645 --> 26:18.645
I'm not going to bed.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.746
Will.

26:19.781 --> 26:21.648
He can stay up for a few
more minutes, can't he?

26:21.683 --> 26:23.984
No. No, it's late.

26:25.019 --> 26:26.954
Now. Teeth brushed, PJ's on.

26:26.988 --> 26:28.689
I'll be in in a sec.

26:29.857 --> 26:30.824
Good night.

26:33.728 --> 26:34.761
I got this.

26:34.796 --> 26:36.697
No, I'm not leaving this to you.

26:45.573 --> 26:47.541
I realize it might be hard,

26:47.575 --> 26:50.377
but I think it would be good
for Will to talk about his mom.

26:51.379 --> 26:52.446
Uh-huh.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.348
I know he's your kid, but
children are curious about...

26:54.382 --> 26:55.349
Drop it!

26:58.219 --> 27:01.121
Why can't he talk about his mother?

27:04.158 --> 27:05.192
Because.

27:06.227 --> 27:08.128
My wife was no saint, okay?

27:08.162 --> 27:10.097
There were a lot of bad times,

27:10.131 --> 27:12.132
and I don't think it'd be
good for him to remember her.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.400
- But...
- No buts.

27:14.402 --> 27:17.104
We don't talk about her and that's final.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.207
Sorry.

27:22.176 --> 27:23.243
It's been a long day.

27:23.277 --> 27:24.945
I'm gonna hit the sack.

27:28.116 --> 27:29.249
Good night.

27:34.155 --> 27:35.722
(Door closes)

27:40.995 --> 27:42.062
So...

27:42.096 --> 27:43.630
So...

27:43.665 --> 27:46.566
I'm gonna get going, I think.

27:46.601 --> 27:48.835
Mm, if you want, or you could stay.

27:48.870 --> 27:50.937
Oh, okay.

28:03.918 --> 28:05.452
Huh.

28:08.756 --> 28:09.790
That's weird.

28:09.824 --> 28:11.525
- Um...
- What?

28:12.527 --> 28:14.294
Um...

28:14.328 --> 28:17.531
The, uh... condom...

28:18.633 --> 28:19.700
Isn't here.

28:20.735 --> 28:22.235
Oh.

28:22.270 --> 28:23.370
- Uh...
- Yeah.

28:24.405 --> 28:25.539
I don't see it.

28:26.574 --> 28:27.507
Uh...

28:28.543 --> 28:29.576
It's gotta be somewhere.

28:31.145 --> 28:32.112
Unless...

28:33.247 --> 28:34.448
You don't think...

28:34.482 --> 28:36.483
Well, I mean, it's somewhere.

28:38.419 --> 28:39.953
Oh, god.

28:40.823 --> 28:42.256
Thanks.

28:48.347 --> 28:49.580
It shouldn't be too long.

28:49.614 --> 28:52.216
It's cool. I got no place to be.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.520
Oh, my sweet god.

28:58.090 --> 28:59.223
- What's wrong?
- He, um...

28:59.257 --> 29:00.391
(gags)

29:00.425 --> 29:02.126
What?

29:02.160 --> 29:04.128
Blood. I don't do blood.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.943

No. What do you think,

29:48.774 --> 29:50.841
this kind of thing just
happens to me all the time?

29:50.876 --> 29:52.877

school for three and a half years.

Seriously?

30:04.489 --> 30:05.589
What happened to her?

30:05.624 --> 30:07.458
We went our separate ways.

30:07.492 --> 30:08.492
Why?

30:08.527 --> 30:10.561
Just wasn't meant to be.

pillow. It was pathetic.

priorities straight, my friend.

Okay, number three:

You have to bring that
same drive and determination

32:54.733 --> 32:56.600
to your schoolwork. Okay?

a chair and work, my friend.

tonight at Stu's after dinner.

Uh, yeah. Sure.

34:13.311 --> 34:14.378
Cool.

34:14.411 --> 34:16.045
See ya.

34:17.348 --> 34:19.917
<i>Daphne's voice: He's just acting so weird.</i>

34:19.951 --> 34:21.318
<i>When I ran into him,</i>

34:21.351 --> 34:24.922
he acted like we barely knew each other.

34:24.956 --> 34:27.056
And he didn't even
introduce me to his friends.

34:27.092 --> 34:28.992
So annoying.

34:29.027 --> 34:30.159
That would annoy me.

34:31.262 --> 34:32.795
The thing is,

34:32.831 --> 34:36.900
I think he likes me, but he's
just afraid of being hurt again.

34:36.935 --> 34:40.938
I guess he had a really bad breakup
with his high school girlfriend.

34:40.972 --> 34:43.806
He said that he was wrecked for months.

34:43.842 --> 34:45.976
If he told you all that,
he sounds pretty open.

34:47.011 --> 34:49.612
He was when we were alone.

34:50.949 --> 34:53.851
Ugh, I just wish I knew what he wanted.

34:56.621 --> 34:58.589
I think that's the wrong question.

34:58.623 --> 34:59.957
What do you mean?

34:59.991 --> 35:02.826
I think you should be
asking what do you want?

35:14.317 --> 35:15.950
Hi.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.386
_

35:22.207 --> 35:24.141
Me too.

35:24.176 --> 35:27.478
I was willing to tutor you
for as long as you needed

35:27.512 --> 35:29.079
to get it.

35:29.114 --> 35:31.282
And you were gonna get it.

35:31.316 --> 35:33.884
You are gonna get it.

35:33.919 --> 35:35.119
Future tense.

35:35.420 --> 35:37.186
_

35:38.587 --> 35:41.057
_

35:43.358 --> 35:50.084
_

35:51.790 --> 35:53.624
But you do.

35:53.659 --> 35:55.826
You have a lot to say.

35:57.496 --> 35:59.864
You are a deaf baseball player

35:59.898 --> 36:01.799
in your freshman year of college.

36:02.834 --> 36:05.736
No one has your life experience.

36:05.771 --> 36:09.440
And when you learn how to express yourself,

36:09.474 --> 36:11.475
it's gonna be a lot easier.

36:11.510 --> 36:12.777
I promise.

36:19.518 --> 36:20.518
Okay?

36:33.398 --> 36:35.399
Can I talk to you?

36:35.434 --> 36:38.135
I'm just finishing up a few things.

36:41.297 --> 36:42.331
We need to talk.

36:44.267 --> 36:45.534
Okay.

36:46.569 --> 36:48.103
What's up?

36:48.137 --> 36:49.171
What's up is...

36:50.206 --> 36:51.373
I don't do secrets.

36:51.407 --> 36:53.408
I kept one for 13 years.

36:53.443 --> 36:55.310
It ate away at me.

36:55.345 --> 36:57.412
And when it finally came out,

36:57.447 --> 36:59.248
it nearly destroyed my family.

36:59.282 --> 37:00.983
All right. Well, hold up.

37:02.252 --> 37:04.920
We just met. There's still a lot
we don't know about each other.

37:04.954 --> 37:07.222
I know that.

37:07.257 --> 37:10.993
But if you're telling me that you are never
gonna tell me what happened with your wife,

37:11.027 --> 37:15.063
if that's something that you are
gonna keep to yourself forever,

37:15.098 --> 37:16.832
that's a deal breaker for me.

37:20.136 --> 37:21.270
(Sighs)

37:24.974 --> 37:26.174
I'll get there.

37:30.079 --> 37:31.780
I'm not ready right now.

37:33.049 --> 37:34.783
But I'll get there.

37:36.085 --> 37:37.686
Okay.

37:38.888 --> 37:39.988
I can take that.

37:49.346 --> 37:50.313
Red.

37:51.348 --> 37:52.882
Come in.

38:00.157 --> 38:01.791
What's going on?

38:01.825 --> 38:02.825
What do you mean?

38:02.860 --> 38:04.227
I thought we had fun last night.

38:04.261 --> 38:06.129
Yeah, we did.

38:06.163 --> 38:08.164
And then I run into you with your friends,

38:08.198 --> 38:09.832
and you completely blow me off.

38:09.867 --> 38:12.935
No, I didn't. I invited
you to come hang out later.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.038
You invited me for a booty call.

38:15.072 --> 38:16.172
Is that bad?

38:17.241 --> 38:18.875
No, it's just...

38:20.844 --> 38:22.211
I want more than just that.

38:22.246 --> 38:25.114
I liked hanging out at the health center.

38:25.149 --> 38:27.817
You know, fooling around

38:27.851 --> 38:29.852
plus conversations outside the bedroom.

38:29.887 --> 38:31.854
Yeah, I do know.

38:31.889 --> 38:33.756
That's called a relationship.

38:33.791 --> 38:35.691
Which I was just in for three years.

38:35.726 --> 38:36.793
Which you know.

38:36.827 --> 38:38.961
And that means you can
never be in one again?

38:38.996 --> 38:41.664
It means I don't want to do it right now.

38:41.698 --> 38:43.800
Look, if I get involved, I stay involved.

38:43.834 --> 38:44.934
I just want to have fun,

38:44.968 --> 38:47.003
and I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

38:47.037 --> 38:48.638
You're right.

38:49.940 --> 38:51.307
So...

38:51.341 --> 38:53.776
<i>Hopefully you're up for a
couple rounds of American Heroes,</i>

38:53.811 --> 38:55.778
a delivery of eggplant parmesan subs,

38:55.813 --> 38:57.780
and a little bit more hanging out.

39:01.618 --> 39:03.019
I'm not, actually.

39:04.054 --> 39:05.588
Oh.

39:07.624 --> 39:09.525
I guess we just want different things.

39:12.963 --> 39:14.797
It's totally fine.

39:14.832 --> 39:15.965
I'll see you around.

39:30.848 --> 39:32.482
Hey.

39:32.516 --> 39:34.784
How'd it go with Coach Walsh?

39:35.786 --> 39:37.920
Well, I told him he could either
turn himself into the Dean,

39:37.955 --> 39:40.556
or I would do the honors.

39:40.591 --> 39:41.657
So he did.

39:43.594 --> 39:45.661
And he is no longer the coach.

39:45.696 --> 39:46.796
Wow.

39:46.830 --> 39:48.598
Who's gonna replace him?

39:48.632 --> 39:49.599
(Chuckles)

39:50.667 --> 39:53.469
I have been asked to be
the interim head coach.

39:54.571 --> 39:56.439
Oh, congratulations.

39:56.473 --> 39:57.440
Thank you.

39:57.474 --> 39:58.741
Now you can do things your way.

39:58.775 --> 40:00.443
(Chuckles)

40:00.477 --> 40:01.511
Yeah.

40:01.545 --> 40:02.845
I guess so.

40:06.683 --> 40:08.484
(Sam giggles)

40:10.921 --> 40:11.921
Hey.

40:11.955 --> 40:13.723
Hi, Sam.

40:14.758 --> 40:16.592
All right, what'd you want to show me?

40:24.902 --> 40:26.602
What's this?

40:27.905 --> 40:30.573
The other day you called me a hero.

40:30.607 --> 40:32.842
- But, uh... I got nothing on you.
- _

40:32.843 --> 40:34.643
_

40:35.432 --> 40:37.266
In my book, you're a hero everyday.

40:39.503 --> 40:42.305
Look, that's nice and all but no
one's gonna wanna look at that.

40:42.339 --> 40:45.274
Tell that to the Kansas City Arts Alliance.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.344
They just approved six more
benches in East Riverside,

40:48.379 --> 40:50.313
each featuring a different everyday hero.

40:50.347 --> 40:51.347
Seriously?

40:51.382 --> 40:52.348
Yep.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.683
They paying you?

40:53.717 --> 40:58.554
Uh, no. But, they're covering
supplies and giving me access.

40:58.589 --> 41:01.290
Looks like you're back
doing community service.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.625
I guess so.

41:02.659 --> 41:04.694
I put five coats of varnish on it

41:04.728 --> 41:06.696
so, if anyone tries to tag it,

41:06.730 --> 41:08.498
it has to be power washed off.

41:08.532 --> 41:09.632
No more whitewashing.

41:09.666 --> 41:11.534
Gordon will hate that.

41:11.568 --> 41:13.469
Yeah, I know.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.472
<i>♪ You and me will hold it high ♪</i>

41:16.507 --> 41:19.409

41:19.443 --> 41:20.610

41:22.312 --> 41:23.513
That's us.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.417
