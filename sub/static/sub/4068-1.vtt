00:37.154 --> 00:39.279
Let me down!

01:23.387 --> 01:25.821
Sweetheart, I'll talk to him.

01:26.163 --> 01:30.038
Son, your mother and me
would like for you

01:30.215 --> 01:34.082
to cosy up
to the Finkelstein boy.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.128
He's a bright kid
and he's going to military school.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.011
Remember,
he was an eagle scout and...

01:41.184 --> 01:46.688
- Arnold, he is a retard.
- Shut up! We're not gonna have a brawl!

01:46.856 --> 01:51.649
We put up with a lot!
Can this wait?

01:51.820 --> 01:54.607
Build up your goddamn muscles.

01:54.781 --> 01:59.110
You know, you could build
your muscles picking strawberries?

01:59.285 --> 02:03.449
You know, bend and scoop?
Like the Mexicans.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.659
Maybe I could get you a job
with United Fruit.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.749
I got a buddy with United Fruit.
It would get you started.

02:10.922 --> 02:15.750
Start with the strawberries and you might
work your way up to these bananas.

02:17.053 --> 02:22.926
When, boy? When are you
gonna get your act together?

02:24.894 --> 02:28.975
- Gross!
- Good God Almighty me!

02:29.149 --> 02:31.225
I think he's the Anti-Christ.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.064
I want to talk to you.
Now listen...

02:36.239 --> 02:39.359
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.318
You get a goddamn job
before sundown

02:43.496 --> 02:47.576
or we're shipping you off
to military school

02:47.751 --> 02:51.583
with a goddamn Finkelstein kid!

02:51.755 --> 02:53.379
Sonofabitch!

07:39.501 --> 07:43.166
- You girls need a ride?
- No.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.461
You sure?
I'm going that way.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.502
- No.
- You young jailbaits.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.885
What's that?
She's hitchhiking.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.680
Watch out!
Coming over, Geronimo!

08:06.444 --> 08:08.484
Hey, double-bubble!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.897
Come on, baby,
I'll give you a ride.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.280
Bend over,
I'll drive you home, baby.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.662
You ain't a chick!

08:18.832 --> 08:22.248
That's the only way
I can get anybody to stop.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.254
That's false advertising, man.

08:25.422 --> 08:29.715
Listen, I slept in a ditch last night,
I almost froze my balls off, man.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.006
I didn't think you had any.

08:32.178 --> 08:37.054
- Wow, I really like your car, man.
- You do?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.265
Did you do this yourself?

08:39.436 --> 08:44.774
- Yeah, I customised it myself.
- Wow! It looks fantastic, man.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.061
Guess it does.
I'll give you a ride, let's go.

08:48.236 --> 08:52.981
- Just a minute. I gotta get my stuff.
- Hurry up, I got a lot of things to do.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.327
- Let's go.
- Just a minute, man.

09:01.499 --> 09:06.078
I got a few more things.
I'll be right back.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.294
Hurry up, man.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.549
What are you gonna do,
move in, man?

09:30.779 --> 09:32.818
First gear.

09:35.367 --> 09:39.993
Second gear.
Here we go...

09:48.880 --> 09:52.960
- How far are you going, man?
- Right here is fine, man.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.625
You ain't scared
of a little speed, are you?

09:55.804 --> 09:58.591
You got some speed, man?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.849
Speed? No, I ain't got no speed, man.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.853
You know what I do got, though?
I got a joint, man.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.729
All right.

10:06.898 --> 10:11.026
Come on, light it up,
let's get Chinese eyes, man.

10:12.153 --> 10:16.198
- What kind of joint is this, man?
- It's a heavy-duty joint, man.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.984
- Looks like a toothpick, man.
- It's not a toothpick, man.

10:20.161 --> 10:25.832
- It is a toothpick, man.
- It's just... It is a toothpick.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.750
I must got it
in the other pocket, man.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.792
Hold on,
I got the bullshit right here.

10:34.884 --> 10:39.131
Oh, that's my dick...
There we go.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.924
There you go,
light that sucker up, man.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.975
Go to the moon.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.303
I hope your dick's
bigger than this, man.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.356
You wanna get out and walk, man?

10:51.526 --> 10:55.524
- You wanna get high?
- Does Howdy Doody got wooden balls?

10:55.697 --> 10:59.564
I got a joint here I've been saving
for a special occasion.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.652
Fire it up.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.699
I hope the drums don't mess up
your upholstery.

11:04.873 --> 11:09.036
- No, I'm in a band too, I'm a lead singer.
- That's hip.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.208
We play everything from, like, Santana
to El Chicano.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.907
Is that a joint, man?

11:44.704 --> 11:48.204
Goddamn, looks like a quarter pounder!

11:49.042 --> 11:50.951
Led Zeppelin!

11:51.127 --> 11:53.203
Be careful with that shit, man.

11:53.380 --> 11:58.088
Is it heavy stuff, man?
Gonna blow me away?

11:58.259 --> 12:01.095
Better put your seatbelt on.
I'll tell you that.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.391
I've been smoking since I was born.
I can smoke anything.

12:05.558 --> 12:11.513
I smoked that Michuacan, Acapulco gold.
I even smoked that tied stick.

12:11.690 --> 12:16.019
- Tied stick?
- You know, that stuff is tied to a stick.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.397
- Oh, Tai stick.
- I felt nothing.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.404
I could probably smoke this whole joint
and still walk away.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.865
No problem at all, man.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.996
Toke it out, man.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.169
It kinda grabs ya!

12:37.340 --> 12:40.092
- Hey, man.
- What?

12:45.724 --> 12:48.179
What's in this shit, man?

12:49.853 --> 12:53.056
Mostly Maui Wowie, man.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.983
But it's got some Labrador in it.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.190
What's Labrador?

12:58.361 --> 12:59.986
- Dog shit.
- What?

13:00.155 --> 13:03.606
My dog ate my stash, man.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.326
Had in on the table
and the little motherfucker ate it.

13:08.496 --> 13:14.250
I had to follow him around with a little bag
for three days before I got it back.

13:14.419 --> 13:19.413
- It really blew the dog's mind.
- You mean we're smoking dog shit, man?

13:19.591 --> 13:21.630
It gets you high, don't it?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.556
I think it's even better than before.

13:37.734 --> 13:41.185
Wonder what Great Dane taste like, man.

13:43.573 --> 13:48.947
Wow, man.
That's some heavy shit, man.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.426
Hey, man...
am I driving OK?

14:10.975 --> 14:15.388
- I think we're parked, man.
- Shit.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.856
I've never had no dope like that
before in my life.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.067
That's the heaviest shit
I ever smoked.

14:23.238 --> 14:27.070
I smoked a lot of dope before,
but that's heavy shit.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.076
- You OK?
- I can't breathe.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.864
- Want some air?
- I can't breathe.

14:35.041 --> 14:40.546
Here, man. I got something
that will mellow you out, man.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.753
You're just freaking out.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.964
I've never smoked
no shit like that.

14:45.135 --> 14:48.420
Take these, man.
These will mellow you out.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.716
- What is that?
- Just take it.

14:54.644 --> 15:00.101
- Hey, don't take those.
- What?

15:00.275 --> 15:04.023
- I almost gave you the wrong shit.
- I already took them.

15:07.532 --> 15:11.316
- What do you mean "wow"?
- Wow, man.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.534
What was that shit, man?

15:13.705 --> 15:17.572
You just ate the most acid
I have ever seen anybody eat in my life.

15:18.835 --> 15:23.830
- I never had any acid before, man.
- Hope you're not busy for about a month.

15:24.007 --> 15:28.087
I'm gonna die, man.
That stuff's gonna make me die.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.677
I never had it before.
It's gonna make me freak out.

15:31.848 --> 15:36.344
I've seen guys that took too much acid,
their heads looked like a pumpkin.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.520
Relax, man.
Mellow out, man!

15:42.150 --> 15:44.107
Just go, "Aum".

15:44.277 --> 15:46.946
- What?
- Do it, man.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.825
- Ohhh, shit.
- Mellooow.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.792
- Better now, man?
- Yeah.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.338
- Mellow?
- Yeah.

16:08.510 --> 16:12.175
- Feel all right?
- Yeah.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.686
- What are you doing?
- Sometimes that helps.

16:19.854 --> 16:24.066
Can we get off this street?
We're parked in a bad spot.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.440
The cops just went by.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.482
We're being pulled over.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.321
It's the cops!
They're coming, man.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.747
Cool, man.
Never had it before, man.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.786
I didn't think
it was going to be like this, man.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.123
What's the problem, son?

16:52.303 --> 16:54.545
Roll down your window.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.053
Keep on knocking but you can't come in...

17:02.939 --> 17:05.228
I gotta roll down the window.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.233
"Weigh the anchor."
"How much did it weigh?"

17:09.404 --> 17:11.977
"I don't know, I forgot."
"You forgot?"

17:12.156 --> 17:14.363
I saw that in a movie once.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.028
- Can I see your licence, sir?
- What?

17:19.204 --> 17:23.867
- Where is your licence?
- It's on the bumper, back there, man.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.083
No, I mean your driver's licence.

17:26.253 --> 17:29.670
Oh, I got my driver's licence.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.259
I just thought of something real funny:

17:36.431 --> 17:38.340
Your mama!

17:43.188 --> 17:46.023
- Sir, what is your name?
- What?

17:46.191 --> 17:48.100
What's your name?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.818
Isn't it on there,
on the licence, man?

17:52.989 --> 17:56.109
That's it, Pedro de Pacas.
That's my name.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.366
Just wait here.

17:59.537 --> 18:03.156
Hurry back,
I miss you already, darling.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.954
I gotta get rid of this dope.
Don't act the fool.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.749
- Oh, OK.
- We're gonna get busted.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.334
I'm blind!

18:16.513 --> 18:18.007
I can't see! I'm blind!

18:23.812 --> 18:27.512
I can see clearly now, the rain...

18:29.693 --> 18:32.480
How long does this shit last, man?

18:32.654 --> 18:34.693
What's your name, sir?

18:36.074 --> 18:40.119
- I told you my name.
- Sir, what's your name?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.362
The dude wants to know your name.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.911
His name is Raaauulph, man.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.521
You're in trouble.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.912
Excuse me,
I need some water.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.632
Fucking vodka, man!

20:37.278 --> 20:40.066
- I'm down here, man.
- I didn't see you.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.988
- You can sleep in that bedroom.
- OK.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.868
- Check you in the morning.
- Where's the bathroom?

20:51.042 --> 20:52.916
It's right there.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.328
- See you tomorrow.
- We've got a rehearsal.

20:57.048 --> 21:00.085
Listen, if you hear
some noise in the bedroom,

21:00.260 --> 21:03.214
don't pay any attention,
it's just me and my lady.

21:03.388 --> 21:07.551
Next tune you hear I'll be doing
on the bedsprings. See you in the morning.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.387
Amigos presenting, your new uniforms.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.437
Hey, man, I can't wear this stuff.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.814
This is terrible.
Look, they don't even fit.

21:25.994 --> 21:29.861
You just don't understand the new style.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.290
It don't even...
It's too short, man.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.663
We'll just make a few minor adjustments.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.709
Hold it, man.
No, I can't wear this.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.045
Curtis, man!

21:42.969 --> 21:45.460
Look at these uniforms.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.094
These uniforms
are out of sight, man.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.840
I hope mine is
as bad as this, you know.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.846
Have you seen the new cuts.

21:53.021 --> 21:56.721
All they need is rhinestones
on the pointed shoes.

21:56.900 --> 22:01.526
- These uniforms are lame, man.
- What do you mean, "lame", sucker?

22:01.696 --> 22:04.982
Where is the white dude
you said was playing the drums?

22:05.158 --> 22:08.776
That's him.
That's James, the bass player.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.824
Seriously, man.
These look like waiter uniforms.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.999
- You don't like them?
- No.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.995
I'll be in the kitchen.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.839
Wait a minute.
He's right, man, these are lame.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.213
This is the new cut.
You'll all be bad.

22:22.384 --> 22:26.168
If we're gonna wear uniforms,
let's all wear something different.

22:26.346 --> 22:31.471
We want something where everybody
wears something different, but the same.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.682
I gotta get out of this stuff.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.857
Those are lame,
get us something else.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.689
- Pedro, this is Curtis, baby.
- I know Curtis, man.

22:41.861 --> 22:46.488
- I'm on top of it, Curtis is on the case.
- Hurry up. We gotta go score a lid.

23:50.138 --> 23:54.005
Man, I can't believe we can't find
no grass nowhere.

23:54.184 --> 23:57.220
Too many people
are smoking it now.

23:57.395 --> 24:01.689
- It's really tough on the rest of us.
- Yeah.

24:01.858 --> 24:07.564
The prices have gone crazy, man.
Some people are paying $100 for a lid!

24:07.739 --> 24:11.238
- Yeah? Wow!
- Who lives here, man?

24:11.409 --> 24:15.952
My cousin Strawberry.
He has probably got some dope.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.031
I hope so.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.209
He is cool.
The thing is, he's a little weird.

24:21.378 --> 24:25.245
He went over to Vietnam,
and he came back all weirded out.

24:25.423 --> 24:29.088
Well, that Nam grass
will do it to you.

24:29.260 --> 24:33.590
That stuff will lay you out, man.
That's what lost the war.

24:33.765 --> 24:37.348
Don't say nothing about his birthmark
cause he flips out then.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.974
I'm not gonna talk about any birthmark.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.186
Don't look at it either.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.814
Are you sure it's a birthmark?

24:45.985 --> 24:51.407
Sometimes that Nam grass
can do weird things to your face too.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.869
- Who is it?
- It's me, Pedro, man.

24:56.037 --> 24:59.987
- Pedro's not here.
- No, I'm Pedro. Open up.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.538
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.628
Come on, it's open.

25:09.968 --> 25:13.171
- Strawberry?
- Strawberry's not here.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.717
Hey, it's a bird, man.
The bird answered the door.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.641
- Wow, what a trip.
- Hi fella.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.188
Wanna get high?

25:28.653 --> 25:30.693
Wanna get high?

25:34.993 --> 25:39.037
Want something to eat, man?
They got some pizza.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.505
Strawberry, what's happening, man?

25:57.557 --> 25:59.182
How you doing?

26:03.021 --> 26:05.512
- Pedro.
- Yeah, right, Pedro.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.400
This is my friend.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.606
How you doing, man?

26:13.782 --> 26:15.940
I'm doing, friend.

26:17.452 --> 26:21.153
We're stopping by
to see if we can score some smoke.

26:21.331 --> 26:24.166
We've been all over,
and nobody's got any.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.667
So, can we score some smoke from you?

26:27.837 --> 26:28.880
Smoke?

26:29.005 --> 26:32.090
You want smoke?
I can get you some smoke.

26:32.258 --> 26:36.042
All right. We can score some smoke
from him, man.

26:36.221 --> 26:41.013
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

26:41.184 --> 26:44.719
I wasn't looking.
I wasn't looking at his neck.

26:44.896 --> 26:49.392
Your friend better stay here 'cause
we're gonna see some people of mine.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.607
And they don't like strange dudes.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.860
They don't fuck around.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.525
I'll stay here.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.366
Look at that, man.
The great outdoors.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.669
Yeah, great outdoors.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.425
El roacho.

28:00.805 --> 28:02.928
It sure looks real...

28:06.144 --> 28:09.264
- Who are you?
- Hey, how are you doing?

28:09.439 --> 28:11.515
I spilled. I made a mess.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.692
- Where have you been all my life?
- We just came in...

28:15.862 --> 28:17.902
Never mind.

28:18.073 --> 28:20.196
It's not really...

28:36.341 --> 28:38.380
Jesus, I don't believe this.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.019
Wasn't that great!

28:50.188 --> 28:52.346
- What a rush. What's it like?
- Good shit.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.784
The freak is leaving
with a basketball.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.746
Cover the freak.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.955
He's covered.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.250
Have the rest of the men stand by.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.129
Stand by.

29:16.297 --> 29:19.501
I think we're onto something
really big here.

29:19.676 --> 29:22.511
This could be
the bust we've been waiting for.

29:22.679 --> 29:25.799
- Right, Sarge.
- Zipping up.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.338
Claymores.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.552
- What?
- Claymores.

30:06.723 --> 30:10.092
Get me past that hutch
and jettison me into the paddies.

30:10.268 --> 30:14.218
There ain't no Paddies,
they are just Chicanos, man.

30:14.397 --> 30:18.312
- What are you talking about?
- Strike that line, chatter grunt.

30:18.485 --> 30:22.233
Deploy a little recon.
Charlie has us surrounded.

30:22.405 --> 30:23.816
Charlie?

30:25.283 --> 30:29.197
It's a cop. They're on your pad.
They're gonna bust your pad.

30:29.371 --> 30:33.155
Strawberry? You've flipped out
on one of your Vietnam trips.

30:33.333 --> 30:37.247
- Hold on to your thing.
- You take the point, I'll take the rear.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.338
If you need air... call it in.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.385
Oh, no!

30:43.885 --> 30:45.762
Oh, shit!

30:47.389 --> 30:48.883
Oh, God. No!

31:18.336 --> 31:19.379
Hello?

31:19.504 --> 31:21.544
- Hello?
- Hello?

31:21.715 --> 31:26.211
Don't answer the phone, even if
it's me calling. I think it's bugged.

31:26.386 --> 31:29.422
- Pedro?
- Yeah, it's Pedro, I mean...

31:29.597 --> 31:32.005
The house is being raided.
Get out of there.

31:32.183 --> 31:34.639
Hey Sarge, listen to this.

31:38.356 --> 31:42.852
- Did you get the weed?
- Outskys, man. You hear? Get outsky.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.904
Sounds very Latin.

31:48.074 --> 31:51.277
Could be the Mexican connection.
Get this down.

31:51.453 --> 31:54.619
Hurry back, man.
There are some joints here.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.197
There's coke and everything, man.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.875
This place is full of joints.
Come back, man.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.128
This could be it, Harry.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.715
Pass the word along.
Tell the men it's time to shoot the moon.

32:10.597 --> 32:13.135
Shoot the moon.

32:13.308 --> 32:17.222
You idiot, not out there,
on the microphone.

32:17.395 --> 32:20.266
Shot the moon. Shot the moon.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.726
Hello? I can't hear you, man.
Just a minute.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.444
Hello? Pedro?

32:30.116 --> 32:32.405
Did we get cut off?

32:34.371 --> 32:36.493
We did get cut off.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.418
Hello?

32:42.045 --> 32:44.334
How am I gonna get him
out of there?

32:49.177 --> 32:51.419
Freeze! This is a bust.

32:51.596 --> 32:56.139
The party is over, folks. You, out!
You, <i>Freebird</i> with the <i>Raincoat,</i> get out.

32:56.309 --> 32:57.803
Not you!

33:02.107 --> 33:05.558
Don't swallow the dope.
We know you're holding it.

33:05.735 --> 33:09.270
How well do you know
that freak with the basketball?

33:09.864 --> 33:11.904
Get a load of these two.

33:12.951 --> 33:17.696
- What's her problem?
- Can't you see she's sick?

33:18.748 --> 33:22.248
- It's turning blue.
- Yeah?

33:22.836 --> 33:26.418
It's high-grade stuff.
Could be Peruvian flake.

33:26.589 --> 33:29.460
That's right.
Just keep on laughing, miss.

33:29.634 --> 33:32.920
This is serious.
This stuff destroys your mind.

33:33.096 --> 33:36.180
Can't you see she's sick?
She's been through a lot.

33:36.349 --> 33:40.098
- She's all fucked up.
- Watch your language, miss.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.512
Get a lab sample of this stuff.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.476
You have the right to remain silent.

33:47.652 --> 33:52.647
If you refuse that right... anything you say
may be used against you...

33:52.824 --> 33:55.908
- Have you got the book?
- No, sir.

33:56.077 --> 34:01.534
...in a court of law...
- Read the book! Jesus!

34:04.919 --> 34:07.873
Excuse me.
OK, take that. Right there.

34:08.047 --> 34:13.338
What's going on here?
Who are you? Who are you?

34:13.511 --> 34:17.639
We're from the finance company.
We came to repossess the furniture.

34:17.806 --> 34:18.850
That?

34:19.225 --> 34:22.926
We gave them a lot of chances
to pay up, but they didn't.

34:23.103 --> 34:26.188
The boss says it's gotta go.
I'm just doing my job.

34:26.358 --> 34:28.184
No, it's whiteball!

34:28.360 --> 34:31.525
Everybody, out!
Move! Everybody out!

34:43.166 --> 34:45.159
It's locked, man.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.626
Let go.
Let go, man.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.330
Come on in.

34:52.509 --> 34:54.585
- What's going on, man?
- It's a bust, man.

34:54.761 --> 34:57.881
We gotta figure out a way
to get you out of here.

35:14.698 --> 35:17.698
Freeze, this is a bust.

35:20.036 --> 35:22.658
Single file!
I wasn't looking at his neck.

35:28.044 --> 35:30.535
The town's dry.
There's no dope nowhere.

35:30.714 --> 35:33.086
I gotta pee.

35:33.258 --> 35:35.085
Hey, Pedro.

35:36.636 --> 35:39.471
Pedro, my man.

35:39.639 --> 35:42.973
- What's happening, Curtis?
- What's going on?

35:43.143 --> 35:45.930
Is this your ride?

35:46.104 --> 35:48.856
I got it of my cousin, Johnny.

35:49.024 --> 35:51.978
This is your...
This bad love machine is yours?

35:52.152 --> 35:55.817
You've got a taste of soul
to you, brother.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.816
And style too.

35:57.991 --> 36:00.778
You know what you need to go
with this bad ride?

36:00.952 --> 36:03.028
- A chick?
- No, baby.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.454
- Knuckles?
- Genuine diamonds, baby.

36:06.624 --> 36:08.950
Those ain't real diamonds, man.

36:09.127 --> 36:11.796
What? Check this... Step back!

36:11.963 --> 36:14.252
Ain't for real? Check this!

36:15.967 --> 36:19.051
What are you doing?
You're scratching my window.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.047
It's cool.

36:21.222 --> 36:25.172
We've been looking all over
for some smoke. You got some?

36:25.352 --> 36:28.352
I got some weed straight from Turkey.

36:28.521 --> 36:31.807
- It's what set them Arabs off.
- Arabs from Turkey?

36:31.983 --> 36:36.195
This stuff is so bad
it'll put a hump on a camel's back.

36:36.363 --> 36:38.604
- No shit?
- I wouldn't shit you.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.821
This is some bad weed.

36:40.992 --> 36:44.942
Check it out.
It'll boogie-woogie on your brain.

36:45.121 --> 36:48.075
I'm gonna let you have it
for a double dime.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.926
This shit ain't shit, man.

37:04.683 --> 37:05.725
What?

37:05.850 --> 37:09.551
We smoked this whole lid
and I haven't even got a buzz yet.

37:09.729 --> 37:11.521
You ain't high?

37:11.690 --> 37:16.019
I ain't high. I'll tell you that.
I don't feel nothing, man.

37:16.194 --> 37:20.441
My man Curtis came through
for us this time.

37:20.615 --> 37:23.284
I'm annihilated, you know.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.491
- What?
- Give me a cookie.

37:25.662 --> 37:28.865
Juan, don't beg me, man.
Go in the kitchen.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.448
You must get high
on lawn clippings, Jack.

37:31.626 --> 37:34.331
This ain't grass, I'm telling you that.

37:34.504 --> 37:36.544
You guys are just tripping, man.

37:36.715 --> 37:39.799
Curtis is our partner, man.
He came through for us.

37:40.427 --> 37:43.214
If he sold you that, man...

37:43.388 --> 37:45.760
Hide, man. It's a bust.

37:49.477 --> 37:51.849
Freeze, you chilli-choking pepper belly.

37:56.568 --> 37:58.644
What have you got here?

38:00.071 --> 38:02.147
Get the seeds.

38:02.323 --> 38:05.657
- Who is it, man?
- It's a bust, get the seeds.

38:05.827 --> 38:10.572
- Why? They can't bust you for seeds.
- Just hide your face.

38:10.749 --> 38:13.915
- We ain't done nothing.
- It's a bust, man.

38:14.085 --> 38:18.332
There is no weed in the house.
What's going on?

38:18.506 --> 38:21.341
- It's just the migra.
- Who?

38:22.093 --> 38:24.880
- I forgot.
- Migra?

38:25.055 --> 38:28.839
They're looking for illegal aliens.
I forgot it's the wedding.

38:29.017 --> 38:31.638
The wedding?
Who are these guys?

38:31.811 --> 38:35.227
The immigration.
They're gonna deport these dudes.

38:35.398 --> 38:37.901
Deport them?

38:38.109 --> 38:42.403
My cousin is getting married down in TJ.
He caused the immigration on himself.

38:42.572 --> 38:45.028
- Why?
- So he can get a free ride, man.

38:45.200 --> 38:50.656
They take the whole wedding party down.
Plus they even get fed lunch.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.159
So, we're cool?

38:52.332 --> 38:55.037
Don't worry...
Unless you don't got a green card.

39:11.309 --> 39:14.227
Hello, Uncle Chuey.
It's Pedro.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.014
Hey man, we got deported.

39:17.190 --> 39:19.792
We're down here at Tijuana right now.
We need a way to get back.

39:19.896 --> 39:22.100
Do you have anything
that needs to be picked up?

39:22.278 --> 39:23.321
Yeah?

39:23.655 --> 39:25.694
Yeah, just hold on.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.237
No, gracias.

39:30.412 --> 39:32.451
What's the address?
1-8-1-1.

39:39.838 --> 39:42.755
- Hey man, we got a ride.
- Far out.

39:42.924 --> 39:46.673
My Uncle Chuey's got a van.
We gotta smuggle across the boarder.

39:46.845 --> 39:49.300
- What are we smuggling?
- Upholstery.

39:49.472 --> 39:53.968
He's got a shop in Beverly Hills,
but he gets all work done cheaper here.

39:54.144 --> 39:57.477
Smuggling of marijuana from Mexico
into the United States

39:57.647 --> 39:59.687
has reached a dangerous high.

39:59.858 --> 40:03.143
The methods have become
unbelievably devious.

40:03.319 --> 40:07.103
These are the seeds which may sow
the destruction of the human race.

40:08.450 --> 40:12.578
I don't think we need to comment
on the seriousness of the situation.

40:15.665 --> 40:17.574
Harry, stop that.

40:20.378 --> 40:25.171
We are on the threshold of copping
one of the largest shipments of marijuana

40:25.342 --> 40:28.960
that has ever crossed the Mexican border
into the United States.

40:29.137 --> 40:33.846
The question is how are they going
to transport it across the border?

40:34.017 --> 40:35.891
- By boat.
- Plane.

40:36.061 --> 40:38.386
- Freight?
- Piggy-back?

40:38.563 --> 40:41.019
- Plastic cans.
- Long trucks.

40:42.150 --> 40:44.190
Let me show you.

40:45.987 --> 40:51.278
- Inside TV sets.
- No, Harry. Not inside TV sets.

40:51.451 --> 40:58.035
The TV set itself is the marijuana.
The tube, the aerial, the whole works.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.209
How can you make a TV set
out of marijuana?

41:01.378 --> 41:04.378
That's a good question.
I'll show you.

41:05.006 --> 41:07.129
The weed is separated from seed.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.218
The weed is then transformed into liquid.

41:10.387 --> 41:13.304
The liquid is then acted upon
by a chemical,

41:13.473 --> 41:15.679
which makes it hard like a plastic.

41:15.850 --> 41:19.219
The plastic is then transformed
into a spray.

41:19.396 --> 41:23.096
This spray, gentlemen,
is called fibreweed.

41:23.525 --> 41:25.850
And is pure marijuana.

41:26.277 --> 41:29.978
Thanks to the efforts of our undercover
man inside the dope factory,

41:30.156 --> 41:32.232
we have some very interesting facts.

41:32.409 --> 41:34.515
That is quite a quantity of marijuana,
gentlemen.

41:34.619 --> 41:36.659
It is not a lid, a kilo or a gram.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.499
How much do you think
is in this dope-factory?

41:39.666 --> 41:40.709
A million pounds.

41:41.126 --> 41:43.249
- Harry?
- A shit-load.

41:43.420 --> 41:44.665
Harry.

41:45.171 --> 41:48.540
We know that the dope-factory
is disguised

41:49.009 --> 41:51.048
as an upholstery warehouse.

41:53.513 --> 41:56.680
This is the street, man.
Come on.

41:56.850 --> 42:00.135
- How can you eat this stuff?
- Don't you like these?

42:00.311 --> 42:04.808
- I told you not to buy them.
- Why did you do that? I would've ate it.

42:04.983 --> 42:07.937
You never know what's in it,
could be a dog.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.982
- You got the address?
- Good dog, man.

42:11.865 --> 42:15.862
- Hey, sonofa...
- 1-8-1...

42:16.036 --> 42:22.038
Is that 7 or 1? Looks like 7.
Let's go and check it out.

42:32.844 --> 42:35.086
We are here to pick up the van.

42:36.431 --> 42:38.673
We're here to pick up the van.

42:39.309 --> 42:42.226
Have a seat,
the boss will be right back.

42:42.395 --> 42:45.230
The boss will be right back.
He's somewhere else.

42:51.279 --> 42:53.485
Those burritos, man.

42:53.656 --> 42:55.733
Where is the bathroom?

42:55.909 --> 42:58.910
- Straight in the back.
- Thanks.

43:00.955 --> 43:02.995
Come on, cheeks, tighten up.

43:10.882 --> 43:12.791
Come on, cheeks,
stay together.

43:12.967 --> 43:15.126
Let's stay together.

43:26.898 --> 43:30.184
Shit! I hope that was a fart.

43:36.908 --> 43:40.194
- Where is the toilet?
- Over there.

43:47.711 --> 43:49.668
Where's the toilet?

43:50.547 --> 43:52.420
Thank you.

43:58.388 --> 44:00.760
I'm sorry, man.

44:08.523 --> 44:10.848
Did you eat one of those burritos too?

44:11.026 --> 44:13.433
Suppose to eat them
with ice cream.

44:16.072 --> 44:18.065
Come on, ice cream.

44:18.908 --> 44:21.779
Even though we don't know
what we're looking for,

44:21.953 --> 44:25.998
we do know the approximate value
of the weed itself.

44:26.166 --> 44:30.875
- I would like to hear your opinions.
- A million?

44:31.046 --> 44:33.619
The TV set alone
is worth close to a million.

44:33.798 --> 44:35.920
- A billion dollars.
- Now we're getting somewhere.

44:36.024 --> 44:39.674
- I'm freezing at two hundred million.
- I think it's four billion.

44:39.846 --> 44:44.971
You're all wrong.
Nine billion big ones, boys.

44:46.603 --> 44:48.227
And you know what that means.

44:48.396 --> 44:53.354
- The better the bust, the bigger the boost.
- Excellent.

44:55.487 --> 45:00.362
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
Any questions?

46:01.511 --> 46:03.587
You sure know
how to roll them big joints.

46:03.763 --> 46:06.848
- You like that, man?
- They're heavy.

46:07.017 --> 46:10.599
I used to be a roadie
for the Doobie Brothers, you know.

46:10.770 --> 46:13.344
What a groovy gig.

46:13.523 --> 46:17.307
Yeah, that's how I learned to play drums.

46:17.485 --> 46:20.190
Speaking to all of them drummers.

46:22.657 --> 46:24.484
I dig Mexico, man.

46:24.659 --> 46:27.743
I'd like to come back here
when we've got more time.

46:27.912 --> 46:32.242
- Are we at the border already?
- Looks that way, man.

46:32.417 --> 46:37.245
- Get rid of the stuff, man.
- Yeah, better get rid of this shit.

46:39.090 --> 46:43.337
Put it down, man. Get rid of it.
We're at the border, man.

46:50.852 --> 46:52.892
Hey, get rid of it!

46:53.063 --> 46:57.060
Not that way, man.
Throw it out.

47:03.448 --> 47:07.861
This is Toyota Kawasaki
here at the Mexican-United States border,

47:08.036 --> 47:11.535
where a huge task force
of narcotic custom agents

47:11.706 --> 47:14.577
is preparing a surprise welcome
for a vehicle

47:14.751 --> 47:18.535
which they say is constructed
entirely of high-grade marijuana.

47:18.713 --> 47:20.955
Don't make that face, man.

47:25.595 --> 47:27.220
Just let me talk to them...

47:27.389 --> 47:29.013
Good afternoon, sisters.

47:29.182 --> 47:31.305
How long have you been in Mexico?

47:32.519 --> 47:34.346
Just be cool.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.763
How long have you guys been in Mexico?

47:36.940 --> 47:38.400
A week.

47:38.692 --> 47:40.352
I mean, a day.

47:40.527 --> 47:42.566
Which one is it, a week or a day?

47:42.987 --> 47:46.273
- A weekday.
- You got any narcotics, marijuana?

47:47.242 --> 47:52.236
- Not any more.
- You better step out of the van.

47:52.414 --> 47:55.783
- I'm on fire!
- Sister's on fire!

48:00.422 --> 48:04.585
This looks like a bust. Get Stedenko
on the phone, this might be it.

48:06.177 --> 48:07.802
What have we got here?

48:07.971 --> 48:09.963
They're busting nuns, man.

48:10.890 --> 48:13.642
- That's cold-blooded.
- Let's watch.

48:16.271 --> 48:18.643
Up against the wall, all of you.

48:22.569 --> 48:26.104
Sergeant Stedenko,
exactly what are you looking for?

48:26.281 --> 48:30.575
Dope, drugs, weed, grass, toot,
smack, quackers,

48:30.744 --> 48:33.863
uppers, downers, all-arounders...
You name it, we want it.

48:34.039 --> 48:36.909
How important is it
to apprehend the suspects?

48:37.083 --> 48:38.126
Critical.

48:38.251 --> 48:42.960
The buying and selling of dope may be
the last vestige of free enterprise left.

48:43.131 --> 48:46.796
There are rumours that the suspects
are armed and dangerous.

48:46.968 --> 48:49.210
Do you expect to see
any violence here today?

48:49.387 --> 48:50.798
I hope so.

48:50.972 --> 48:54.009
- Have you yourself smoked marijuana?
- Once.

48:54.184 --> 48:57.600
- We're on TV, man.
- Hi, Mom.

48:57.771 --> 48:59.597
This could be it.

49:00.899 --> 49:02.642
- Let's find out, man.
- Yeah.

49:02.817 --> 49:07.147
- Listen, I gotta go and pee.
- Don't go scuba diving.

49:12.494 --> 49:15.032
So, it was a station wagon, Harry.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.913
Very devious.

49:19.084 --> 49:22.749
- They almost look like real nuns.
- Right down to the stockings.

49:22.921 --> 49:24.712
Very clever.

49:29.844 --> 49:32.679
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

49:32.931 --> 49:35.552
Reminds me of a story
my dad used to tell me.

49:35.725 --> 49:39.509
The only kind of meat a priest
could eat on Friday was nun.

49:39.688 --> 49:41.147
Inside!

49:42.023 --> 49:45.772
- Harry, get a sample of that car.
- Yes, sir.

49:49.948 --> 49:53.032
Start the interrogation.
I'll be right back.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.507
Hey, what's going on out there, man?

50:15.515 --> 50:18.136
Excuse me,
what's going on out there?

50:18.309 --> 50:23.351
It's nothing. Just some people
doing what they're not supposed to.

50:41.082 --> 50:43.122
Some asshole pissed on my leg!

50:43.293 --> 50:45.332
Our agent just phoned from Mexico.

50:45.503 --> 50:49.750
It's not a bunch of nuns in a station wagon,
it's two hippies in a green van.

50:54.679 --> 50:57.764
Must be some heavy shit.
Let's go, come on!

51:00.018 --> 51:02.057
Get that siren up!

51:10.820 --> 51:14.688
Where would these two creeps hang out?
Where do hippies hang out today?

51:14.866 --> 51:17.024
Sunset Strip,
that's where they hang out.

51:17.786 --> 51:20.905
Yeah, we can try there.

51:21.081 --> 51:24.200
If not there,
we can go up to San Francisco.

51:24.376 --> 51:26.997
Imagine the field trip
these two creeps will have

51:27.170 --> 51:30.669
when they find out
that the van is made of grass.

51:30.840 --> 51:34.968
I don't believe it.
You guys are supreme idiots.

51:35.136 --> 51:40.094
How can you let a big, green van
slip through your fingers.

51:40.266 --> 51:42.093
What did we end up with?

51:42.268 --> 51:45.637
Busting a bevy of nuns,
a guy pisses on my leg.

51:45.814 --> 51:50.108
I lose my special canine sentry dog.
The best cop I ever knew.

51:50.777 --> 51:53.185
- See anything?
- Negative.

51:53.363 --> 51:55.770
Use mine, they're on the floor.

51:58.660 --> 52:01.945
Yeah, these are great,
I can see everything.

52:02.122 --> 52:03.948
What do you see?

52:04.666 --> 52:07.157
There is a great doughnut shop
up there.

52:07.335 --> 52:09.043
No, on the road!

52:09.212 --> 52:12.130
Wait a minute.
There's the van!

52:12.298 --> 52:14.754
- There's the van!
- Yeah, that's it.

52:14.926 --> 52:20.169
Listen, when we get back,
let's get serious about this group.

52:20.348 --> 52:24.595
Yeah, if we practise all the time
and rehearse, we can have a heavy band.

52:24.769 --> 52:28.814
Let's not let anything interfere
with our music this time.

52:28.982 --> 52:31.687
- Hey, do you see what I see, man?
- Yeah.

52:31.860 --> 52:34.944
- Hey, they're hitchhiking, man.
- All right.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.405
There they go.

52:41.578 --> 52:44.329
I wonder what they're doing
way out here.

52:46.583 --> 52:51.541
I don't know, but here comes
the Mounties to their rescue.

52:51.713 --> 52:56.291
Turn around. They are over there.
Keep an eye on them!

53:00.680 --> 53:04.263
You want to drive?
Take over.

53:04.434 --> 53:06.058
What are you doing?

53:06.227 --> 53:08.054
Hi, ladies.

53:10.732 --> 53:13.057
Here you go.
Watch your step.

53:13.234 --> 53:15.808
I'll watch everything else.

53:15.987 --> 53:18.027
Hey, what's happening?

53:18.198 --> 53:21.282
- How far are you going?
- All the way.

53:22.952 --> 53:26.037
We are going there ourselves.
Come on over.

53:27.332 --> 53:29.905
- There they go, Harry.
- I see them!

53:30.085 --> 53:34.248
Shoot their tyre.
Not yours, use my gun.

53:46.101 --> 53:49.102
My God!
Damn it, you stupid, idiot!

53:49.270 --> 53:52.971
Look, you idiot!
You are a stupid, stupid man.

53:53.149 --> 53:56.898
Get over here, Harry!
Give me that gun!

54:00.365 --> 54:03.615
When I think of the time and the money
I wasted on your training,

54:03.785 --> 54:06.869
and you turn out to be a blithering idiot!
You're an utter failure!

54:07.038 --> 54:08.865
You make me sick.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.496
Have you anything to say for yourself?
In the car!

54:13.086 --> 54:17.795
I will never, ever, put a bald-headed man
in the department again.

54:38.862 --> 54:41.863
Wow, it's a neat van.

54:42.032 --> 54:44.653
Yeah, you wanna see the rest of it?

54:44.826 --> 54:48.491
- OK.
- Yeah? We'll go right back there.

54:48.663 --> 54:50.703
The rest of it is right back there.

54:50.874 --> 54:55.286
Go ahead, watch your step.
There you go. Right back there.

54:56.212 --> 54:58.252
Have fun in the Magic Mountains.

54:58.423 --> 55:02.290
Yeah, I see London, I see France.

55:04.596 --> 55:07.680
If I'm not out in three weeks,
send a search party.

55:07.849 --> 55:09.972
Hold on, don't start without me.

55:21.696 --> 55:24.982
- You wanna do a lude?
- You got ludes?

55:25.158 --> 55:28.408
No, I don't have any ludes,
I wish I had ludes.

55:28.578 --> 55:30.618
I thought you said you had some.

55:30.789 --> 55:32.413
No, I don't have some.

55:32.582 --> 55:34.954
I don't have enough.

55:35.126 --> 55:36.371
All right, all right.

55:36.544 --> 55:39.629
I wish I had some, you know.

55:40.632 --> 55:43.039
I love a manly chests.

55:43.218 --> 55:47.429
So do I.
I mean, on a girl.

55:47.597 --> 55:51.346
Attention all units, attention all units.
This is Sergeant Stedenko.

55:51.518 --> 55:54.637
Attention all units,
this is Sergeant Stedenko.

55:54.813 --> 55:59.356
We are changing from a code 3
direct pursuit to a code 347...

55:59.526 --> 56:01.814
completely lost,
due to incompetence.

56:08.326 --> 56:11.363
You know where these chicks are going?
They're going to the Roxy.

56:11.538 --> 56:14.704
They're having
a battle of the bands there.

56:14.874 --> 56:17.200
And the winner gets a record contract.

56:17.377 --> 56:19.037
A battle of the bands?

56:19.212 --> 56:23.079
It's the best thing in the world.
Everyone's gonna be there.

56:23.258 --> 56:26.294
The winner gets a record contract
with Rowel Records.

56:26.469 --> 56:29.139
That's not gonna mean dick
unless they promote you.

56:29.305 --> 56:34.430
We could get our band in it and win, man.
It's a hundred dollars too.

56:34.602 --> 56:37.888
We couldn't enter.
We don't even know any tunes yet.

56:38.064 --> 56:41.765
We've had two rehearsals, man.
Besides, it's just punk rock.

56:41.943 --> 56:45.692
You don't have to know how to play,
all you gotta do is be a punk.

56:48.825 --> 56:53.238
We gotta get loaded first, though.
We need to score a lid.

56:53.413 --> 56:55.951
- Stop and I'll call Gloria.
- Who's Gloria?

56:58.585 --> 57:00.873
Hi, you're looking good.

57:01.046 --> 57:03.501
You wanna go powder our noses,
you know?

57:03.673 --> 57:06.378
Anyway, I wanna talk
some business, OK?

57:06.551 --> 57:08.378
I got the powder.

57:08.553 --> 57:11.673
She's got the best stuff,
I'm telling you.

57:14.142 --> 57:18.389
- She can bust me any time.
- You should see her summer whites.

57:20.148 --> 57:21.975
Come here.

57:27.781 --> 57:33.321
- That's heavy.
- Yeah. I bet a lot of cops smoke dope.

57:33.495 --> 57:36.946
No, I mean that.
Looks like a radio station.

57:37.123 --> 57:42.829
The request lines are now open.
KGFJ Soul Radio.

57:43.004 --> 57:44.333
Do it now.

57:44.506 --> 57:46.545
Request lines are now...

57:46.716 --> 57:48.756
Shit, it's open.

57:48.927 --> 57:50.804
Go ahead.

57:53.223 --> 57:57.220
Officer Clyde, contact Headquarters
and give them our location.

57:57.394 --> 58:00.264
And then I want to
take off your dress...

58:02.482 --> 58:04.522
And then I want to take off your bra...

58:06.403 --> 58:08.442
And then I'm gonna take off your shoes.

58:11.908 --> 58:14.613
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
Can you hear me?

58:14.786 --> 58:17.621
Hello, Headquarters.
Come in Headquarters.

58:17.789 --> 58:21.372
- This is Officer Clyde, we are...
- Use the codename!

58:21.543 --> 58:25.243
Headquarters, come in.
This is codename <i>Hard head.</i>

58:25.422 --> 58:28.091
Hat! <i>Hard hat!</i>
Give me that!

58:28.258 --> 58:33.050
Hello, radio dispatch.
This is <i>Hard hat.</i> You read me?

58:33.221 --> 58:36.507
Was that <i>Lard ass?</i>

58:36.683 --> 58:40.301
Codename <i>Hard hat.</i>
Do you read, radio dispatch?

58:40.478 --> 58:46.647
- Got something for you, <i>Lard ass.</i>
- <i>Hard hat!</i> Do you understand?

58:46.818 --> 58:48.396
<i>Lard ass!</i>

58:48.570 --> 58:51.903
<i>Hard hat!</i> Radio dispatch,
do you know who this is?

58:52.073 --> 58:54.362
No, who is this?

58:54.534 --> 58:58.033
- This is Sergeant Stedenko!
- Yeah? You know who this is?

58:58.204 --> 58:59.247
No!

58:59.789 --> 59:01.663
Bye bye, <i>Lard ass.</i>

59:22.771 --> 59:25.226
Attention Headquarters,
attention Headquarters.

59:25.398 --> 59:29.526
This is codename <i>Lard...</i>
this is codename <i>Hard hat.</i>

59:29.694 --> 59:33.063
Any signs of them
within the last half hour?

59:35.784 --> 59:38.903
- They burnt the stash they had.
- Oh, no!

59:39.079 --> 59:43.207
Can you believe it?
They burnt the whole thing yesterday.

59:43.375 --> 59:45.866
They're expecting a new one in
from Tijuana.

59:46.044 --> 59:50.373
It's supposed to be worth millions
and millions of dollars.

59:50.548 --> 59:54.676
The cops are out looking for it now.
Jesus, I hope they find it.

59:54.844 --> 59:58.759
Me too. If they find it,
can you set aside some lids for me?

59:58.932 --> 01:00:01.933
You can believe we'll have a party!

01:00:05.939 --> 01:00:08.062
Why don't we just split, OK?

01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:13.310
Bye, Glo, see you. You want me
to give you the number to that guy?

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:16.109
- Bye bye.
- See you.

01:00:18.493 --> 01:00:22.740
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll meet you guys outside, OK?

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:39.632
Come on, man.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.686
Sometimes when you gotta go bad,
you can't.

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:52.980
Come on, man.
You wanted to go out there.

01:00:53.153 --> 01:00:55.192
I'll put you back in the closet.

01:00:58.324 --> 01:01:00.994
I think he's got stage fright, man.

01:01:09.419 --> 01:01:11.791
Ah, that's the one.

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:15.627
Hey man, thanks a lot.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.296
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, man. Look at it!

01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:22.713
- I'm sorry.
- Hey! Come back!

01:01:22.891 --> 01:01:25.014
Jesus Christ!

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.555
Can everybody be quiet,
I'm calling home.

01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:33.772
Hello?
Who's this?

01:01:34.944 --> 01:01:39.986
James! Listen, we got a gig at the Roxy.
Get the guys, OK?

01:01:40.158 --> 01:01:44.286
Be sure to be there, don't be late.
All right, see you later.

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:48.534
It's together, man.
We're gonna be there, man.

01:02:06.976 --> 01:02:10.595
- Does this show?
- Yeah, they sure do.

01:02:10.772 --> 01:02:13.856
- I mean this, the spot.
- Let's see.

01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:17.311
- Yeah, a little bit. I'll take it out for you.
- Will you?

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:20.607
- Yeah, sure. Just take it off.
- Great!

01:02:39.426 --> 01:02:43.554
- I'll just do a toot.
- No, man, not in the front.

01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:46.094
Now get in the back.

01:02:47.308 --> 01:02:50.475
Get in the back! Get in the back!

01:02:53.523 --> 01:02:55.065
Hey, Pedro.

01:02:55.233 --> 01:02:56.484
Pedro!

01:02:56.985 --> 01:02:59.310
- What's the matter?
- Pedro!

01:02:59.487 --> 01:03:01.231
You still like me, don't you?

01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:04.691
- Pedro, come here, man!
- He's so sweet.

01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.196
Get out here, man!

01:03:06.369 --> 01:03:08.409
Where did you learn
how to drive, man?

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.746
We got stopped by the cops.
I don't have a driver's licence.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:14.917
- Why didn't you tell me that before?
- What are we gonna do?

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:21.632
- Shit! Change place with me, man.
- I don't think he's seen us.

01:03:21.801 --> 01:03:26.131
- No, sit down.
- My leg's caught.

01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:49.947
- What do you guys want?
- Nothing.

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:57.243
You mind if I have a bite
of your hot dog?

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:02.624
Yeah, man.
You can have the whole thing.

01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:07.548
- Want some frittos?
- No, no.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.008
This is fine. Thank you.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:17.352
You guys have a nice day.

01:04:23.697 --> 01:04:25.985
- What?
- You're squashing my nuts.

01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:34.578
Did that really happen?

01:04:34.749 --> 01:04:38.664
What was that dude's trip, man?
I thought we were gonna get busted.

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:42.455
- It may be a trick, man.
- OK, just sit there and be cool.

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:47.967
- Damn, man!
- I wonder what he's been smoking.

01:04:48.138 --> 01:04:50.011
I wish we had some.

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:54.013
We gotta score some
before we go on.

01:04:54.185 --> 01:04:56.890
- But where, man?
- I don't know.

01:04:57.063 --> 01:05:00.812
There's gotta be somebody in this town
that's got a lot of smoke.

01:06:49.759 --> 01:06:51.799
She was like nuts.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:55.173
You could always tell
if she was balling a man.

01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:57.388
Everyone would be dozing off

01:06:57.559 --> 01:07:01.343
and all of a sudden
she would start up like...

01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:07.936
But then she would get going
and she'd be more like...

01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:14.154
And she starts going like a motorboat,
you know...

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:22.161
Her boyfriend's name was Alex.
Fuck me...

01:07:29.966 --> 01:07:32.208
Fuck me, Alex. Fuck me.

01:07:33.845 --> 01:07:35.838
I've got a cramp.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:42.343
That's just like it. You're doing good.

01:07:57.118 --> 01:07:59.444
Yeah, that's just like it!

01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:04.828
- Then she'd have two tears.
- That's better.

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:08.837
That feels better. Oh, God.

01:08:09.005 --> 01:08:11.675
I need some air.

01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:23.264
Right on, man!
I didn't know you're name was Alex.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:27.564
- I got a cramp.
- I'd have a cramp there too, man.

01:08:27.732 --> 01:08:29.274
What's going on out here?

01:08:34.197 --> 01:08:37.068
You don't know where you're going,
wait for me.

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:40.693
Make way for the new king.
You're a star, man.

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:43.278
After you, King Salami.

01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:47.292
They don't know
where the best dressing room is.

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:42.550
The next day,
he comes up to me and says,

01:09:42.724 --> 01:09:46.140
"Thanks for being there,
like you saved my life."

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.805
Just like Cher.

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:58.143
Come on, man.
We're gonna be on in two more bands.

01:09:58.323 --> 01:10:01.573
You gotta hear what these other
groups are into, man.

01:10:01.743 --> 01:10:05.361
These kids are into something heavy.
Listen to this new song.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.045
Hey man, are you awake?

01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:22.547
- I don't feel so good.
- Did she give you some pills?

01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:26.423
Yeah, I gave him some,
but I gave him ups.

01:10:26.601 --> 01:10:31.844
Come on, man.
Hey, how many fingers do you see?

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:35.939
I think I fucked it up.

01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:38.648
Anybody got some coffee?

01:10:38.822 --> 01:10:44.445
I got a popper. We can either like party
later or try to start his heart.

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:50.998
Get up.
Come on. Get up.

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:52.994
Watch where you're going.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.258
You're not dying, you know.
Know what I'm saying?

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.393
Come on, I got you.

01:11:11.563 --> 01:11:15.228
I was thinking, maybe we should have
some paper between us.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.018
In this business a handshake
doesn't mean dick.

01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:28.026
Everybody into the van. Hurry!

01:11:45.013 --> 01:11:46.555
There's one.

01:13:26.573 --> 01:13:29.858
That's right, boys.
Everybody in. All the way down.

01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:32.241
All the way down.
That's right, boys.

01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:35.947
We want to talk to you
about joining your order.

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.842
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Can I see some tickets, guys?

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:58.225
We don't need tickets.
We are brothers of faith.

01:13:58.396 --> 01:14:01.563
We don't need tickets
to walk with love in the world.

01:14:01.733 --> 01:14:04.058
We got see the tickets.

01:14:04.235 --> 01:14:07.189
All right,
we are not brothers of the faith.

01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:11.492
- We are police officers.
- Sorry, man. You gotta have tickets.

01:14:11.659 --> 01:14:13.486
That's a ticket.

01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:17.955
- That is a gun, not a ticket.
- Did you bring an ID?

01:14:31.888 --> 01:14:35.755
We have got to get in here.
It is very important.

01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:38.555
- Sergeant, the van!
- The van!

01:14:40.146 --> 01:14:42.186
No wonder
Anita Bryant's pissed off.

01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:50.402
Hey you!
Wait a minute!

01:14:50.573 --> 01:14:55.319
- Where are you taking this tow-truck?
- Hey, take a walk!

01:14:55.495 --> 01:14:57.867
What do you mean?
Who are you?

01:14:58.039 --> 01:15:00.744
- Who owns this van?
- Who are you anyway?

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.788
- Sergeant Stedenko!
- Sergeant Stedenko.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:06.667
- What van?
- What do you mean?

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.331
- Let's see some ID.
- Show them your ID.

01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:12.082
Hold it!
Come back here.

01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:15.097
- What did we do?
- Not a damn thing.

01:15:17.267 --> 01:15:20.102
Hey, you know who he is?
Tell him who you are.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:22.309
Benny, will you shut up!

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.063
Call the paddy wagon.
I'll notify Headquarters.

01:15:27.777 --> 01:15:33.020
Moving right along. We don't know
who they are, but here's Alice Bowie.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:53.642
You guys really had a scheme going,
didn't you?

01:16:53.822 --> 01:16:59.362
Thought you would get away with it?
Almost nine billion dollars.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:02.869
Nine billion big ones
to help disease young minds

01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:05.826
with marijuana, smack, toot,
crackers, you name it.

01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.622
Sarge, the wagons are on their way.

01:17:08.795 --> 01:17:13.006
Do you realise this is the bust that is going
to send me right to the top?

01:17:28.356 --> 01:17:31.026
Harry, are you sure you talked
to Headquarters?

01:17:31.192 --> 01:17:34.811
- They're on their way. Relax.
- Have a cheeseburger.

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.027
- A sundae?
- Hot fudge?

01:17:37.198 --> 01:17:39.868
Hot fudge sundae
with cream on top.

01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:43.534
Nothing for me.
What have we got here?

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.908
- They're anchovies.
- Good, thanks.

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.918
- How many pieces have you had?
- I'm stoned.

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:54.413
Yes, you are very, very stoned.
Look at this.

01:17:54.591 --> 01:17:59.834
You've got food all over your uniform.
You've got no self-control whatsoever.

01:18:23.328 --> 01:18:28.998
OK, are you guys ready?
One, two, three!

01:19:46.369 --> 01:19:49.489
Why don't you guys admit it,
you've got munchies.

01:19:50.832 --> 01:19:54.782
I've never seen anything so disgusting.
You are a disgrace to the force.

01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:58.412
Do you understand, Harry?
I am stoned!

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:04.177
- So, go with it.
- You're telling me to go with it.

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:06.468
You almost botch up
the entire operation.

01:20:06.639 --> 01:20:09.012
You lose my best dog.
Two guys piss on my leg.

01:20:09.184 --> 01:20:12.054
I'm on the verge of a pig-out
and you say, "Go with it!"

01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:14.850
- I'll go with it!
- Go with it.

01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:17.317
Go with it.

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:52.242
You hear that
standing ovation?

01:21:53.955 --> 01:21:56.956
We're gonna have a bad band.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.912
We had them eating
right out of our hands.

01:22:00.086 --> 01:22:02.542
We're gonna be big, man.

01:22:02.714 --> 01:22:05.834
We're gonna be bigger
than Ruben and the Jets, man.

01:22:06.009 --> 01:22:10.303
All we gotta do is keep practising, man.
Just keep it together.

01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:13.389
I feel good, man.
I wish we could have some to celebrate.

01:22:13.558 --> 01:22:15.052
You got a joint?

01:22:15.977 --> 01:22:18.515
- Hey!
- What, did we get pulled over?

01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:20.895
I just remembered, I got some hash.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.150
Yeah? Well, fire it out!

01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:28.317
- I need a pin or something.
- There's a pin on my tutu, man.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:32.867
Remind me, we got to take those back,
or we'll get charged for extra days.

01:22:33.036 --> 01:22:34.863
I forgot all about this, man.

01:22:35.038 --> 01:22:40.744
We're a big band. We're gonna have
a limo, food backstage, everything!

01:22:40.919 --> 01:22:44.833
We need a manager, though.
That's the only thing.

01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:49.253
My cousin. He doesn't have a job.
We'll make him the manager.

01:22:49.427 --> 01:22:52.547
He's got a van too.
It'll be heavy.

01:22:52.722 --> 01:22:54.514
We're gonna be the heaviest dudes.

01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:57.968
Get all new instruments
and everything, man.

01:22:58.144 --> 01:23:00.137
All right! What's this?

01:23:00.313 --> 01:23:03.184
- I think it's hash.
- Doesn't look like much, man.

01:23:03.358 --> 01:23:04.900
Where did it go?

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:09.858
Watch the road!

01:23:12.534 --> 01:23:15.155
Watch the road, man!

01:23:15.328 --> 01:23:19.029
Shit! Can't you put anything
in my lap, man?

01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:22.327
Well, stop the car!
