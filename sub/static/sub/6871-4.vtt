01:15.341 --> 01:17.409
What's wrong?

01:17.411 --> 01:18.710
My-my-my-my--

01:18.712 --> 01:21.046
Pam. Pam!

01:25.286 --> 01:27.419
Ow! God dammit, dude.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.854
Well, I'm sorry,

01:28.856 --> 01:31.857
But I've got other shit
to do today.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.292
Now, what the hell
is wrong with you?

01:33.294 --> 01:36.261
My sister edie
is getting married

01:36.263 --> 01:39.298
To don ekblad, jr.
Of all people,

01:39.300 --> 01:42.067
And she asked me
to be a bridesmaid.

01:42.069 --> 01:45.137
Um...
I should be
maid of honor, dicknuts,

01:45.139 --> 01:48.207
But no,
guess who she asks instead?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.275
Uh...
Midge olerud!

01:50.277 --> 01:52.611
No!
Yes.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.146
Midge "hey edie,

01:54.148 --> 01:56.248
"let's me and you blow
pam's boyfriend arn

01:56.250 --> 01:59.151
Behind the goddamn grain
elevator" olerud!

01:59.153 --> 02:00.919
You had a boyfriend
named arn?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.655
Well, he didn't know
I liked him, but--

02:03.657 --> 02:04.656
Midge and edie did.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.925
[cries]
pam!

02:06.927 --> 02:08.259
Okay, jesus.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.461
Calm down, ike turner.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.598
I don't want
to show up with a black eye.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.433
Not a real
diverse crowd, huh?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.101
Eye, idiot, eye.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.603
Although, no.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.139
Not a lot of black guys
in rural wisconsin.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.107
And, I don't want
to sound racist,

02:22.109 --> 02:23.575
But--
power through it.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.844
A black guy would
be better than no date,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.746
Which is what
I'm taking now.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.648
When is it?
Saturday.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.483
Day after tomorrow.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.019
[burps]

02:34.021 --> 02:35.487
Screw it, I'll go.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.022
[gasps]
really?

02:37.024 --> 02:38.423
Really, really, really?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.591
Yeah, why not?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.793
Oh, man.
Wait till they see--

02:41.795 --> 02:46.465
Wait, that's how
you ask a woman out?
Yes.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.500
Wait, no,
I don't need a back-story.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.969
Yes you do. Shut up.
You're gordon shumway,

02:50.971 --> 02:53.639
And you own a 500-acre
dairy farm in upstate new york,

02:53.641 --> 02:58.110
With 600 holsteins and two
herringbone milking parlors.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.345
Okay, a, that's alf's name,

03:00.347 --> 03:02.014
And two,
what's more impressive,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.649
A pathetic cheese farmer

03:03.651 --> 03:05.684
Or the world's greatest
secret agent,

03:05.686 --> 03:09.621
A.K.A., me, sterling archer.
Oh, yeah.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.958
<i>[woman on p.A.]</i>

<i>now boarding flight 934,</i>

03:12.960 --> 03:14.626
<i>To green bay, wisconsin.</i>

03:14.628 --> 03:16.028
Come on, archer,
that's us.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.797
Flight 934,
to greenbay, wisconsin.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.299
Yeah, you're booked
through to new york.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.333
Will you be needing
anything else?

03:21.335 --> 03:22.701
Huh?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.571
Oh, is there a place
that sells down jackets

03:25.573 --> 03:26.972
And thermal underwear?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.207
[laughs]

03:28.209 --> 03:30.676
I'm, uh,
what do you call it?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.477
Coldblooded.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.253
[lana]
archer? Archer?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.254
Archer!

04:15.256 --> 04:16.421
[groans]

04:16.423 --> 04:18.089
Have you seen archer?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.458
Did you look in here?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.560
I--
that is what I'm doing now.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.794
Then, I guess
go look everywhere else.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.429
You know...

04:24.431 --> 04:25.998
[cheryl/carol]
starting with
dick-cheese, wisconsin.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.967
Excuse me?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.435
Him and--
he and...

04:30.437 --> 04:32.704
Whomever, and...
Whoever, and...

04:32.706 --> 04:34.106
[gasps]

04:34.108 --> 04:36.408
If you wake this child,
I will climb inside you

04:36.410 --> 04:37.976
With my shoes on.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.313
He and pam
are at her sister's wedding.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.215
In wisconsin?

04:43.217 --> 04:44.249
[baby cries]

04:44.251 --> 04:46.084
[lana groans]
happy?

04:46.086 --> 04:48.320
No, no, no,
he's got her all weekend.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.222
I'm going upstate
for sere school.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.790
So take her with you.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.325
To survival school?

04:53.327 --> 04:55.294
Big whoop,
hang her in a bear bag.

04:55.296 --> 04:58.830
[growls]
so... Mallory...

04:58.832 --> 05:00.832
Nope. Ron and I are going

05:00.834 --> 05:02.401
To our house in the hamptons,

05:02.403 --> 05:05.771
And, trust me, it would
be no place for a baby.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.973
You're back together?
Like, for real?

05:07.975 --> 05:11.310
And happier
and stronger than ever.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.080
Try not to burn
the place down.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.649
And you, my tweedy widdle--

05:17.651 --> 05:20.152
What, are your boobs
full of corn syrup?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.453
Excuse me?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.155
Feel that,
she feels chubby.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.923
She's a baby.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.759
A fat widdle baby,
yes you are, yes you are.
[crying]

05:27.761 --> 05:30.195
You're fat widdle baby.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.297
Fast forward
to me buying her liposuction

05:32.299 --> 05:33.765
For graduation.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.301
I hope you do
burn this place down.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.837
She said not to.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.774
[gasps]
she said try not to.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.043
[archer]
you're kidding.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.978
How either,
in this universe,

05:46.980 --> 05:49.181
Or any of
it's infinite parallels,

05:49.183 --> 05:51.483
Could I possibly
embarrass you?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.952
[pam]
by dressing like
a maitre d' on a dinner cruise

05:53.954 --> 05:56.288
For gay republicans?
That's a thing?

05:56.290 --> 05:57.723
[pam]
I don't know,
but you don't want

05:57.725 --> 06:00.192
Edie dogging you out
in front of the entire school.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.560
The entire what?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.161
[pam]
rehearsal dinner.
Shut up.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.896
Come on, what happened?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.666
Did she dump pig's blood
all over you at the prom?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.134
No, not pig's blood.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.535
Wait, what?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.504
Hang on,
did she really?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.005
Oh my god, pam...

06:14.007 --> 06:16.541
You look amazing.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.310
Really?

06:18.312 --> 06:20.212
I mean, you know,
relatively.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.380
Shit-ass.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.714
But you've
got to pace me,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.483
I'm sewn into this sumbitch.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.884
So for every ounce
that goes in,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.819
An ounce gotta go out.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.755
So, diuretics?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.490
And laxatives.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.358
There's a sundae bar.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.193
What could
possibly go wrong?

06:35.195 --> 06:36.828
[knocking]

06:36.830 --> 06:38.363
Who the shit is that?

06:38.365 --> 06:40.699
[barry]
is it barry?

06:40.701 --> 06:44.269
Does that mean barry possibly,
literally froze his nuts off

06:44.271 --> 06:46.238
In the wheel-well of a 747

06:46.240 --> 06:48.640
So he could murder
the shit-eating archer?

06:50.343 --> 06:52.677
Yes it does, other barry.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.945
Oh, yes.
[knocking]

06:53.947 --> 06:56.348
[archer]
okay. Jesus christ.

06:56.350 --> 06:59.885
[laughs]
uh, wow.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.454
You have got to be edie.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.290
Uh, I'm archer,
uh, pam's boyfriend.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.393
Bullshit, my asshole.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.096
Pam, hon?
Edie's here.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.265
And you will be civil
and polite.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.933
And you will not let
her push your--

07:14.935 --> 07:18.703
[edie]
spamela!
Get your fat ass out here.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.405
[breathes deeply]

07:20.407 --> 07:22.073
Uh, she should
be right out, she's--

07:22.075 --> 07:23.809
[screaming]

07:23.811 --> 07:25.143
[glass shattering]

07:29.649 --> 07:31.049
Yikes.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.019
Guess I should get in there
and break that up.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.495
[elevator dings]
[pam]
wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.397
Yeah, come on.
You comin'?

07:45.399 --> 07:48.400
No, but hey,
I know it's late notice,
and I really hate to ask,

07:48.402 --> 07:50.502
But would you mind
keeping a.J. For the--

07:50.504 --> 07:51.937
What?
I'm hitting door open.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.672
You can't see it,
but I really am.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.808
Oh, my god, it's just like
maximum overdrive.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.310
Ray!
Lana!

07:58.312 --> 07:59.744
On Monday
let's talk about

07:59.746 --> 08:01.580
How scary
this was for me.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.148
[groans]

08:03.150 --> 08:05.951
God dammit!
Let me go!

08:05.953 --> 08:08.253
No, now just calm--
let me go!

08:08.255 --> 08:09.788
Shit, she's gonna--

08:09.790 --> 08:10.922
Jesus christ, woman!

08:10.924 --> 08:11.957
Whoo!

08:11.959 --> 08:13.291
God dammit!

08:13.293 --> 08:14.793
[spits]
happy?

08:14.795 --> 08:16.628
Less than I was,
to be honest.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.263
When?
When you were chugging balls

08:18.265 --> 08:19.831
Behind whatever
gay strip joint

08:19.833 --> 08:21.132
She hired you at?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.467
Whoa.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.135
Told ya,
it's that jacket.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.670
First of all,
pam, shut up.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.339
I'm not the one
who chugs balls

08:27.341 --> 08:28.673
Behind buildings,

08:28.675 --> 08:30.141
And even if I were,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.477
They wouldn't belong
to that dude arn.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.846
[laughs]

08:34.847 --> 08:37.182
Oh god,
you told him about arn?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.950
Arn didn't even
know she was alive.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.452
Okay,
you know what?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.486
Besides what arn's
balls taste like?

08:42.489 --> 08:43.655
[laughs]

08:43.657 --> 08:47.959
I--
ah! I am out of here.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.561
Pam, wait!

08:49.563 --> 08:51.162
[laughs]
wow,
and here I thought

08:51.164 --> 08:53.365
She was kidding
about the pig's blood.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.134
[laughs]
no...

08:56.136 --> 09:00.071
It was--
it was calf's blood.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.473
[laughing]

09:04.076 --> 09:06.912
[cries]
stupid, frickin' edie.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.648
I'll show her
what arn's balls taste like.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.316
Wait, what the?

09:11.318 --> 09:12.317
Barry?

09:12.319 --> 09:13.952
Hey...

09:14.921 --> 09:16.855
You.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.056
[body thuds]

09:18.058 --> 09:19.424
[lana]
hello?

09:19.426 --> 09:20.525
Krieger?

09:20.527 --> 09:21.860
You in here?

09:21.862 --> 09:23.094
Hey, you!

09:23.096 --> 09:24.563
What can I do you for?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.933
So, hey, um,
archer totally flaked on me.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.401
Mallory and ray
are being lame,

09:29.403 --> 09:31.770
And cheryl is-- cheryl.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.072
So I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.840
Yep, yep, yep,
but, first,

09:35.842 --> 09:38.076
Who is this little person?

09:38.078 --> 09:41.179
Um, a.J., my baby,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.615
Who I've had for,
like, six months,

09:43.617 --> 09:45.116
Who you've met.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.351
Mm-kay.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.119
Ooh, and who also
has a poopy diaper.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.455
[gasps]
great bacchus plateau,

09:50.457 --> 09:51.756
It works!

09:51.758 --> 09:53.191
What? What does?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.594
The k-9000
infrasonic pulse rifle.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.062
What do you mean?
What does it do?

09:57.064 --> 10:00.398
I assume you're familiar
with the brown note.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.866
I am not, no.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.768
What? The brown note,

10:03.770 --> 10:05.136
The frequency
that makes humans

10:05.138 --> 10:07.706
Shit their pants,
or their onesie.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.141
[sighs]
I'm pretty sure
that was a coincidence.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.777
That's what they said
about tesla's death ray.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.813
So, this favor...

10:14.815 --> 10:16.114
Lana?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.116
Wait, lana.
What's the favor?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.585
[lana[
just promise to use
your powers for good!

10:20.587 --> 10:23.989
[laughs]

10:23.991 --> 10:25.223
No.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.725
[archer]
yes.
No.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.660
Clean the jizz out of
your ears, jizz-ears.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.961
I'm getting married
tomorrow,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.229
So tonight
at my rehearsal dinner,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.897
I get all you can eat
prime rib

10:32.899 --> 10:34.633
And bottomless vin rogue.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.967
Gimme that.
Put it down.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.602
We are going
to go find pam,

10:37.604 --> 10:38.903
And then you
are gonna apologize

10:38.905 --> 10:40.338
For hurting her feelings.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.941
Why do you care?
You're just a-- wait.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.076
Are you really
her boyfriend?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.078
Mm-hm.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.314
Oh, and a secret agent,
so...

10:49.316 --> 10:51.082
[phone rings]

10:51.084 --> 10:53.952
And, not only
am I a secret agent,

10:53.954 --> 10:55.920
I am the world's
greatest secret agent.

10:55.922 --> 10:56.955
Mm... Hello?

10:56.957 --> 10:58.957
<i>[barry]</i>
<i>jesus, archer.</i>

10:58.959 --> 11:01.092
You're not even the greatest
<i>secret agent in that room.</i>

11:01.094 --> 11:02.527
[laughs]
actually, barry,

11:02.529 --> 11:04.129
That's where you're--
wait! Barry?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.296
<i>[barry]</i>
<i>hey, dummy.</i>

11:05.298 --> 11:06.698
How did you get--
where are you?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.033
How did you even
know I was here?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.300
[barry]
uh, I followed you.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.002
What do you mean,
you followed me?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.838
Okay, that's obviously
your abusive ex-boyfriend,

11:13.840 --> 11:16.174
So I'm just gonna
tip on out.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.176
<i>[barry]</i>
<i>I was on my way to new york</i>
<i>to kill you,</i>

11:18.178 --> 11:20.845
<i>When I saw you</i>
<i>in chicago, idiot,</i>

11:20.847 --> 11:23.181
<i>And now you</i>
<i>are gonna follow me.</i>

11:23.183 --> 11:25.950
That is, if you ever wanna
see your buddy--

11:25.952 --> 11:27.619
Uh-- wait,
what was your name?

11:27.621 --> 11:30.622
[spits]
your worst frickin'
nightmare.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.557
<i>[archer]</i>
<i>pam?</i>
<i>Oh right, yeah, it's pam.</i>

11:32.559 --> 11:34.693
Anyway, if you don't wanna
spend the next year

11:34.695 --> 11:37.796
Signing for packages full
of her head and feet and shit,

11:37.798 --> 11:39.864
Meet me out
by the old grain elevator.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.167
<i>[barry]</i>
<i>pam says edie knows</i>
<i>where it is.</i>

11:42.169 --> 11:43.401
Now, you listen to me,
barry, you--

11:43.403 --> 11:44.869
[dial tone]
barry!

11:44.871 --> 11:48.073
God damn,
son of a cyborg bitch!

11:48.075 --> 11:49.507
What,
he give you anal warts?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.476
He kidnapped your sister,
you jerk!

11:51.478 --> 11:52.510
What?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.012
Who'd wanna kidnap pam?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.914
I'll tell you in the car.
Come on!

11:55.916 --> 11:57.582
Look, I know you're bitter

11:57.584 --> 11:59.150
'cause you people can't
get married or whatever,

11:59.152 --> 12:02.887
But all you care
to eat prime rib!

12:02.889 --> 12:05.523
[sighs]
well, edie, I was almost
half-way hoping

12:05.525 --> 12:06.691
It wouldn't come to this.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.792
Come to what--

12:09.395 --> 12:13.064
[cyril]
hello? Lana?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.033
No...?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.534
What are you still
doing here?

12:16.536 --> 12:18.703
I thought you had
rambo sleepaway camp.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.005
Sere school, and I did,

12:21.007 --> 12:22.941
But archer hosed me,
and I don't have a sitter.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.275
Oh, well you should
have asked--

12:24.277 --> 12:26.745
I asked everybody,
even krieger.

12:26.747 --> 12:30.348
I-- wow,
so you'd ask krieger

12:30.350 --> 12:32.684
To watch your baby
before you'd ask me?

12:32.686 --> 12:35.687
I didn't, well--
that would be weird.

12:35.689 --> 12:36.921
Weirder than the guy
trying to make

12:36.923 --> 12:38.790
Some kind
of ejaculation ray?

12:38.792 --> 12:41.893
No,
it's a pants-shitting ray.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.895
Okay, well, then,
that's new, but--

12:43.897 --> 12:45.630
Cyril, look--
how about this?

12:45.632 --> 12:46.931
I'll drive
you both upstate,

12:46.933 --> 12:48.233
And get us a motel room.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.034
[laughs]
what?

12:50.036 --> 12:51.803
For a.J. And me.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.139
While you run around the woods
eating snails and beetles.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.274
That way if you get anxious
about being away from her,

12:56.276 --> 12:58.309
We're right there.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.878
This is weird.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.412
Why is this weird?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.414
Because what kind
of sick bastard

13:03.416 --> 13:05.383
Travels with duct tape
and rope?

13:05.385 --> 13:06.918
No, we actually
made a couple of stops

13:06.920 --> 13:08.386
While you were
knocked out.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.488
Had to get more
tom for the collins--

13:10.490 --> 13:12.056
Oh, and also
rob a gun store.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.158
Wait, what?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.793
Well, technically,
burgle.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.127
How long was I out?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.428
Mm... 20 minutes?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.730
Dammit!

13:18.732 --> 13:20.598
Yeah, that is not
good for you.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.066
No,
turn around dick-nuts,

13:22.068 --> 13:23.802
I can still make
the rehearsal dinner.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.071
After we rescue pam.
Now, shut up.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.140
Oh, and un-shut up
for a second.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.575
Is this the way
to the grain elevator?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.410
Ah... Oh, yeah,
right down that road.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.912
Take a left.
Take a left!

13:36.015 --> 13:38.149
Even for me,
that was pretty lucky.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.919
Wa-hoo!

13:40.921 --> 13:43.521
Rental car!

13:43.523 --> 13:47.959
[barry]
there we go.
Looking good, barry.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.694
Well, thanks,
other barry.

13:49.696 --> 13:50.962
Archer comes in
to save her,

13:50.964 --> 13:52.664
And boosh!

13:52.666 --> 13:54.265
K-k-k-kill zone!

13:54.267 --> 13:56.267
So you're just bug-nuts
crazy, huh?

13:56.269 --> 13:59.838
[laughs]
crazy like a fox!

13:59.840 --> 14:02.640
Who's bionic!

14:02.642 --> 14:04.542
And, whose fiance
dumped him,

14:04.544 --> 14:06.778
For literally
the dumbest guy in russia?

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
Who want waffle?

14:10.449 --> 14:13.518
I forget to make waffle.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.720
Oh, and just so you know,
my worst nightmare,

14:15.722 --> 14:17.522
Which is actually recurring,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.891
Is me and santa claus
getting chased through the snow

14:19.893 --> 14:22.694
By lurch
from the adam's family.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.563
Uh, why did
you tell me that?

14:25.565 --> 14:28.633
[laughs]
exactly.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.707
[archer]
piece of shit rental.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.543
[edie]
you drive like a...
Egg.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.679
I-- no, I don't,
and also, shut up

14:41.681 --> 14:43.648
Because right now
I'm going to explain

14:43.650 --> 14:46.217
What cyborgs are,
and why they're a threat,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.720
To our entire
way of life.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.689
[cyril]
I mean, not now,
obviously.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.157
But, someday.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.359
Someday soon...

14:54.361 --> 14:57.595
[snoring]

14:57.597 --> 15:00.598
I am gonna
re-hit that.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.601
Huh? Hm?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.703
Hey, you.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.105
Hello.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.373
Wait.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.741
Who's laws
of what's its?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.277
Asimov's three laws
of-- look,

15:12.279 --> 15:14.279
Never mind.
They don't even apply to barry

15:14.281 --> 15:16.114
Because he's a frickin'
cyborg.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.850
[barry, singsong]
archer...

15:18.852 --> 15:22.587
Come out and play.

15:22.589 --> 15:26.691
Ugh, and also
a gaping, prolapsed anus.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.259
So, grain elevator.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.928
Besides a place
to blow farmers,

15:29.930 --> 15:30.962
What's the point?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.964
To store grain,
dumbass.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.400
Yeah, but you elevator
it way the hell up there,

15:35.402 --> 15:38.436
Then-- wait, cows don't
go up there to eat it,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.438
Do they?
Oh my god,
no!

15:40.440 --> 15:44.409
It's gravity fed back down
to trucks and trains and shit.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.476
Which are on the ground.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.744
Yes!

15:46.746 --> 15:48.379
See where I'm going
with this?

15:48.381 --> 15:51.115
Why not make it horizontal,
so the cows can just walk up

15:51.117 --> 15:52.750
And eat whenever?

15:52.752 --> 15:55.386
So just a mile long trough
of grain getting rained on

15:55.388 --> 15:56.454
All the damn time?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.956
I-- well, no.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.125
It would have like
a salad bar roof on it,

16:01.127 --> 16:03.294
You idiot.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.129
[barry]
said the dumb waiter.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.764
Get it, archer?

16:06.766 --> 16:10.168
As in, you're dumb,
and you dress like a waiter.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.270
[pam]
told ya!
God dammit, pam,

16:12.272 --> 16:14.472
This is exactly
what a man should wear to a--

16:16.008 --> 16:17.842
Holy shitsnacks!
What the--
pam?

16:17.844 --> 16:20.611
[sighs]
yeah, and just a heads up--

16:20.613 --> 16:22.180
[growls]

16:22.182 --> 16:23.181
[pam]
whoa!

16:23.183 --> 16:25.416
Dammit, pam.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.652
How about a--
oh, wait by heads up,

16:27.654 --> 16:29.153
Did you mean--?

16:30.856 --> 16:31.990
[grunting]

16:37.029 --> 16:39.297
Seriously, barry,
why all the anger?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.266
Because katya
broke up with me!

16:42.268 --> 16:44.235
[laughs]

16:47.706 --> 16:48.773
Too soon?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.778
Edie, cut me down!

16:53.780 --> 16:56.147
Oh, wow,
where to start?

16:56.149 --> 16:59.050
Even in a new dress,
you look like ten pounds of shit

16:59.052 --> 17:00.651
In a five pound bag.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.021
The whole town thinks
you're a giant asshole

17:03.023 --> 17:04.388
For moving to new york city.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.392
You can just
say new york.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.795
Oh, and dad was right,
you'll never find a husband

17:10.797 --> 17:12.563
Unless you convince
a blind man

17:12.565 --> 17:14.298
You're a seeing eye pig!

17:14.300 --> 17:16.733
[cries]

17:16.736 --> 17:20.038
I meant cut me down
from here!

17:20.040 --> 17:21.539
Yeah. Duh.

17:21.540 --> 17:25.143
But you know
you're no prize, right?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.577
Excuse me?

17:26.579 --> 17:27.545
He said--

17:27.547 --> 17:29.680
[growling]

17:29.682 --> 17:31.549
[laughs]

17:31.551 --> 17:32.550
[thuds]

17:36.922 --> 17:39.023
Archer! Do something!

17:39.025 --> 17:40.658
Flower box.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.726
Shot gun.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.828
[grunts]

17:43.830 --> 17:44.896
[thuds]

17:44.898 --> 17:45.997
[pam]
ow.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.532
[growls]

17:47.534 --> 17:48.566
[gagging]

17:51.670 --> 17:53.671
Hey, track suit,

17:53.673 --> 17:57.075
If anybody's gonna choke
my sister's bitch neck,

17:57.077 --> 17:58.776
It's gonna be me.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.045
[laughs]
what are you doing?

18:01.047 --> 18:03.181
What you got a little
shot gun? Huh?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.782
Yeah,
remember right now?

18:04.784 --> 18:07.118
When I'm a frickin'
cyborg?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.954
[archer]
barry, just for you,

18:09.956 --> 18:12.290
I got explosive ammo.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.058
You what, now?

18:14.060 --> 18:16.294
Jesus christ,
you could have killed me!

18:16.296 --> 18:18.196
Shut up!

18:18.198 --> 18:21.466
Huh, I mean,
I'm not a doctor,

18:21.468 --> 18:22.733
Or, a robotisist,

18:22.735 --> 18:25.436
But, uh,
that can't be good.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.637
So, hey,
why don't we all do this--

18:26.639 --> 18:27.705
[gunshot]

18:27.707 --> 18:30.741
[archer]
oh, god.
Oh!

18:30.743 --> 18:32.810
[machine voice]
forgot what I was gonna say.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.548
[screams]

18:37.550 --> 18:39.584
[objects crashing]

18:39.586 --> 18:41.452
[scream continuing]

18:41.454 --> 18:42.987
[body thuds]

18:47.259 --> 18:49.193
[rattling]

18:51.263 --> 18:53.965
So, thank you...

18:53.967 --> 18:55.066
For?

18:55.068 --> 18:56.501
Saving your life?

18:56.503 --> 18:58.836
I thought you were
thanking me...

18:58.838 --> 19:00.838
For dropping
those truth bombs.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.241
What?
You'll never find a husband.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.745
So, you really
think he's dead?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.680
[archer, sighs]
only one way to be sure.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.926
[edie]
hello? I'm sorry, what?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.661
Shut up, no,
uh-uh. No!

19:23.663 --> 19:25.663
What are you saying,
don?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.666
[police officer]
sir, sir, over there.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.067
Is that a man?

19:31.770 --> 19:34.438
Yeah,
you're damn right it is.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.211
Hey, but slow down, though,
we're, hey--!

19:42.614 --> 19:44.448
Jesus christ, arn.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.552
Huh. I think I got
a blowjob out here once.

19:47.554 --> 19:52.123
[edie]

did you say a blowjob?

19:52.125 --> 19:55.626
What? Yes!
Of course it's off, don!

19:55.628 --> 19:58.129
[screams]

19:59.998 --> 20:03.501
So, apparently,
don over-served on vin rogue,

20:03.503 --> 20:06.304
And increasingly impatient
for his bride-to-be's arrival

20:06.306 --> 20:07.972
At the rehearsal dinner,

20:07.974 --> 20:11.209
Let midge olerud suck him off
behind the sundae bar!

20:11.211 --> 20:13.878
[laughs]

20:13.880 --> 20:15.246
Too soon?

20:15.248 --> 20:18.749
So thank you, pamela,
for ruining my wedding.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.918
Oh, and also,

20:20.920 --> 20:22.920
You ruined my life!

20:22.922 --> 20:26.023
Are you happy?

20:26.025 --> 20:27.491
Yes.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.594
[chuckles]
