Three.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.299
Give me two.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.305
Two.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.580
Can I have five cards,
please?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.518
Five?
What, are you serious?

00:59.592 --> 01:01.787
Four's the limit.
Let's see your ace.

01:01.861 --> 01:05.558
If Mr. Weems wants fve,

01:05.632 --> 01:07.759
give him five.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.631
[Dealing Cards]

01:17.343 --> 01:19.777
Dealer takes two.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.950
Four.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.854
Nah.

01:39.232 --> 01:43.293
- How much is that?
- [Dealer] Four grand keeps you in...

01:43.369 --> 01:46.133
you and your five
shiny new cards.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.798
[Chuckles]

01:49.843 --> 01:51.777
There's 4,000.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.714
And four more.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.984
Let's make this interesting.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.785
I'm raising you 15 large.

02:06.426 --> 02:10.055
I wouldn't do that.
This is all I need.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.026
You're gonna need Depends...
after you see this hand.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.510
Now we show each other
our cards?

02:36.289 --> 02:38.223
[Sighs]

02:40.927 --> 02:42.861
Four kings.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.760
That's a straight flush,
right?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.978
Beginner's luck.

03:02.782 --> 03:06.650
- What the hell
do you think you're doin'?
- Going home.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.051
No, no.
Not so fast.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.091
We expect a chance to win
some of our money back.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.799
Guys, there's over
a hundred thousand dollars here.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.631
You're damn right there's over
a hundred thousand dollars there.

03:27.006 --> 03:28.940
A hundred thousand's
all I need.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.568
Sorry.

03:31.644 --> 03:34.010
I had fun, though.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.607
Where can I cash out?

instead of down.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.339
Guys?

04:03.610 --> 04:08.638
Guys, this is not what
I meant by "cashing out." Hey!

04:11.050 --> 04:12.847
Hey!

04:12.919 --> 04:15.752
[Screaming]

04:33.706 --> 04:35.640
[Grunts]

06:12.971 --> 06:14.905
- [Line Ringing]
- [Mulder] Hello?

06:14.973 --> 06:17.874
Mulder, it's me. What now?

06:17.943 --> 06:20.104
- Are you in Chicago?
- Yes, I'm in Chicago.

06:20.179 --> 06:23.910
I'm on the northeast corner of Seventh
and Hunter just like you asked.

06:23.982 --> 06:27.748
Only you're not here.
So where are you?

06:27.820 --> 06:30.118
Oh, around.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.123
- Yeah?
- Hey, nice outfit.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.194
Hey.

06:37.262 --> 06:39.753
What's down there?

06:39.832 --> 06:42.665
Before you check out down there,
check out up there.

06:44.436 --> 06:47.132
The top two floors are leased
to oneJimmy Catrona,

06:47.206 --> 06:50.266
- whose name you might be familiar with.
- Organized crime.

06:50.342 --> 06:54.369
The Bureau's been trying to build
a racketeering case
against him the past few years.

06:54.446 --> 06:56.437
Gambling, extortion, murder.

06:56.515 --> 07:00.042
Which is why last night there
were two agents parked across
the street in surveillance.

07:00.119 --> 07:03.646
They witnessed a man being thrown
from Catrona's roof at 10:40 p.m.

07:03.722 --> 07:08.056
This man fell 30 floors,
plus the distance down this shaft...

07:08.127 --> 07:12.188
because these doors just happened to be
open, straight through, nothing but net.

07:12.264 --> 07:16.200
- Ouch.
- I'm guessing that's what he said...

07:16.268 --> 07:20.170
after he got up, climbed out of here
and scampered off into the night.

07:27.446 --> 07:31.576
- Mulder, you keep saying this man.
Who is this man?
- No idea.

07:31.650 --> 07:35.484
He got away. The agents gave chase,
but no clear description.

07:35.554 --> 07:38.580
- Was this basement thoroughly searched?
- No.

07:38.657 --> 07:41.387
Technically, falling 300 feet
and surviving isn't a crime.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.553
And your theory is?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.393
What if this man had some kind
of special capability...

07:46.465 --> 07:49.696
some kind of genetic
predisposition towards...

07:49.768 --> 07:52.999
rapid healing
or tissue regeneration?

07:53.071 --> 07:57.303
So basically, what we if
were looking for Wile E. Coyote?

07:58.744 --> 08:00.974
You're saying that
he's invulnerable.

08:01.046 --> 08:03.071
- Right?
- Yeah.

08:03.148 --> 08:08.711
In 1998, there was a British soldier
who plummeted 4,500 feet
when his parachute failed.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.551
Then he walked away
with a broken rib.

08:13.058 --> 08:15.720
- What's your point?
- My point is that if there's...

08:15.794 --> 08:19.230
a wind gust
or a sudden updraft,

08:19.298 --> 08:21.858
and plus if he landed
in exactly the right way...

08:21.934 --> 08:25.301
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe he just got lucky.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.497
What if he got
really, really lucky?

08:27.573 --> 08:30.940
That's your big scientific
explanation, Scully?

08:31.009 --> 08:33.807
I mean, how many thousands
of variables would have to convene...

08:33.879 --> 08:36.813
- in just the right mixture
for that theory to hold water?
- I don't know.

08:36.881 --> 08:38.816
No. Thousands.

08:38.884 --> 08:40.613
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

08:40.686 --> 08:44.246
[Scully]
Look at this.

08:44.323 --> 08:48.783
If this cart were on the platform when
he hit, that would explain the wheels.

08:48.860 --> 08:51.954
And what if this whole thing
had just enough give to save his life?

08:52.030 --> 08:55.397
- We'd have to find him to ask.
- Yeah, we'd have to find him.

09:17.022 --> 09:20.185
Looks like maybe we found
part of him already.

09:31.336 --> 09:32.928
[Doorbell Buzzing]

09:33.005 --> 09:35.997
I think you're taking
a flier here, Mulder.

09:36.074 --> 09:39.532
There's gotta be at least 600 people
with prosthetic eyes
in the greater Chicago area.

09:39.611 --> 09:44.275
But only this one Henry Weems
made an appointment this morning
to get a new one.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.109
Maybe he can't see his way
to the door.

09:49.187 --> 09:51.280
[Door Opens]

09:53.992 --> 09:56.790
Come on, Scully.
I'm feeling lucky.

[Elevator Bell Dings]

10:05.270 --> 10:07.204
[Door Opens]

10:08.907 --> 10:11.842

It's an emergency.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.579
[Water Spraying]

10:20.986 --> 10:23.250
- Ma'am, we're not plumbers.
- I didn't say you were.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.916
I just want the damn water
turned off so I can go to work.

10:25.991 --> 10:30.052
You gotta be stronger than me, right?
Valve's under the sink.

10:34.399 --> 10:38.358
Your building super Henry Weems,
he isn't around?

10:38.437 --> 10:42.168
Mr. Dependable? Might as well wait
forJimmy Hoffa to show up.

10:47.312 --> 10:50.042
You're turning it
the wrong way.

10:50.115 --> 10:52.811
- Hey, Richie, sweetheart, back in bed.
- But, Mom...

10:52.884 --> 10:55.444
Butts are for sitting,
and I want yours back in bed.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.853
He's right.
Clockwise.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.789
I know that.

11:00.859 --> 11:02.952
Clockwise.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.970
[Floorboards Creaking]

11:24.616 --> 11:27.050
You okay, Mulder?

11:27.119 --> 11:29.587
Yeah, it's all right.
My ass broke the fall.

11:29.654 --> 11:32.953
Guess who I found.

11:33.024 --> 11:35.788
Henry Weems, I presume?

11:48.640 --> 11:51.404
Next time leave the plumbing
to a professional.

11:53.845 --> 11:55.779
Oh, uh...

11:55.847 --> 12:00.546
Oh, uh, you wanna try
this on for size, Cinderella?

12:08.960 --> 12:13.021
Mr. Weems, why were you hiding
in a vacant apartment?

12:13.098 --> 12:15.259
Not hiding. Avoiding.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.097
- Avoiding whom?
- You people.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.468
Now that you found me,
let's just get it over with.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.804
No way am I testifying
againstJimmy Catrona.

12:23.875 --> 12:28.039
Last night, Catrona had you thrown
off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue.

12:28.113 --> 12:30.377
- Is that correct?
- You didn't hear it from me.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.941
I'm not letting you people move me
to Muncie, Indiana to milk cows.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.548
More to the point,
you survived a 300-foot fall,

12:38.623 --> 12:41.217
- essentially unharmed.
- [Flesh Squishing]

12:43.528 --> 12:47.123
I don't know.
Maybe the wind was just right.

12:47.199 --> 12:50.896
And I landed on
a bunch of towels. No biggie.

12:50.969 --> 12:54.166
- You got lucky?
- Yeah, I guess.

12:54.239 --> 12:57.367
Except you should look
at my bruise.

12:58.810 --> 13:01.244
[Moans]

13:01.313 --> 13:03.941
Plus, I didn't get to keep
my poker winnings.

13:04.015 --> 13:07.314
So, that's what you were doing there
last night, playing poker?

13:07.385 --> 13:09.979
Catrona thought I was cheating.
I wasn't.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.421
But like I said,
you didn't hear it from me.

13:12.491 --> 13:15.688
Must've been a high-stakes game,
I imagine. Did you win a lot of money?

13:15.760 --> 13:18.854
I don't know.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.864
A little.

13:24.469 --> 13:28.371
[Mulder]
What is that? Did you make it?

13:28.440 --> 13:31.204
Uh-huh.

13:31.276 --> 13:33.767
- It's sort of a hobby.
- Mm-hmm.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.836
Mind if l...

13:59.434 --> 14:03.871
- Ah. That's craftsmanship.
- Wow.

14:03.939 --> 14:06.203
- What does it mean?
- What do you mean what does it mean?

14:06.275 --> 14:09.005
- What's...
- It doesn't mean anything.

14:09.077 --> 14:11.375
I just sort of...
I don't know.

14:11.446 --> 14:13.971
It's cause and effect.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.750
- So, are... are we done here?
- [Scully] Mr. Weems?

14:17.819 --> 14:21.050
Can I ask you to reconsider
testifying against Catrona?

14:21.123 --> 14:25.321
- Nope. No way, Jose.
- It would be in your best interest.

14:25.394 --> 14:28.329
He's tried to kill you once,
and he will undoubtedly do it again.

14:28.397 --> 14:33.630
- Yeah, we can protect you.
- I'll take my chances.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.742
So, here's the plan
as I see it.

14:41.810 --> 14:44.870
We inform the Chicago
field office about Weems,

14:44.947 --> 14:47.848
leaving it to them
to secure his testimony.

14:47.916 --> 14:50.077
You change your clothes,

14:50.152 --> 14:54.350
we fly back to D.C. By sunset
and all is right with the world.

14:54.423 --> 14:57.859
Come on, Scully. Are you gonna dump this
case just as it's getting interesting?

14:57.926 --> 15:02.693
Interesting, Mulder, was when
we were looking for Wile E. Coyote.

15:02.764 --> 15:06.757
Come on, Mulder. This guy just
got lucky. There's no X-File here.

15:06.835 --> 15:09.531
Maybe his luck is the X-File.

15:12.874 --> 15:14.808
Stairs.

15:19.348 --> 15:21.282
[Elevator Bell Dings]

15:34.463 --> 15:36.397
Oh.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.729
Car keys.
Must have lost 'em when I fell.

15:46.274 --> 15:48.742
- [Doorbell Buzzing]
- [Gunshot]

16:14.436 --> 16:16.370
[Gasps]

16:25.047 --> 16:27.515
So, you get many of these?

16:29.951 --> 16:31.885
Okay.

16:33.922 --> 16:36.288
So, uh, they searched
the entire building,

16:36.358 --> 16:39.623
and there's no sign
of Henry Weems.

16:39.695 --> 16:42.220
I'm guessing that
he's on the run.

16:42.297 --> 16:46.097
Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini,
a.k.a., Angie the Animal.

16:46.168 --> 16:48.762
He's an enforcer
for the Catrona family.

16:48.837 --> 16:51.067
And I don't think
his visit was friendly.

16:51.139 --> 16:54.074
You think that Weems
could have killed him in self-defense?

16:54.142 --> 16:57.873
A skinny guy with no depth perception
against a man nicknamed the Animal?

16:57.946 --> 17:01.712
I don't think so. You and I both
know Weems didn't kill anybody.

17:01.783 --> 17:04.911
Besides, we were gone for two minutes.
This guy doesn't have a scratch on him.

17:04.986 --> 17:07.579
I'm thinking it was
a heart attack.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.520
What the hell
happened here, Mulder?

17:13.595 --> 17:15.790
Cause and effect.

17:15.864 --> 17:19.527
- Meaning?
- Okay, so watch.

17:20.836 --> 17:23.099
So Bellini kicks down the door.
[Karate Grunt]

17:23.171 --> 17:26.628
Poised to kill Weems, right? But just
as he's about to pull the trigger,

17:26.708 --> 17:28.642
a noise startles him.

17:28.710 --> 17:31.941
The buzzer when I buzzed
to be let back in the apartment.

17:32.013 --> 17:35.005
So when he does pull the trigger,
his aim is off.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.176
Right?
And he hits the lamp...

17:37.252 --> 17:39.618
which falls over and knocks over
the ironing board.

17:39.688 --> 17:42.589
So as the bullet ricochets,
Weems dives over the sofa.

17:42.657 --> 17:45.751
Now when Bellini goes for him,
he trips over the ironing board,

17:45.827 --> 17:47.795
bounces off the chair,
flips end-over-end...

17:47.863 --> 17:50.457
and his shoelace gets caught
in the fan... Q.E.D.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.604
Cause and effect.

17:57.672 --> 18:01.164
Seemingly unrelated and
unconnected events and occurrences...

18:01.243 --> 18:04.235
that appear unrelated
and random beforehand,

18:04.312 --> 18:08.271
but which seem to chain-react
in Henry Weems' favor.

18:08.350 --> 18:12.286
- Dumb luck?
- Yeah. He seems to have
tapped into it somehow.

18:12.354 --> 18:14.288
He won big at poker,

18:14.356 --> 18:17.723
he survived getting thrown off
a skyscraper, and now this.

18:22.063 --> 18:24.395
- Hang on a second.
- Okay.

18:24.466 --> 18:27.526
Hey, your name's Richie,
right?

18:27.602 --> 18:29.433
- Yeah.
- I'm Dana.

18:29.504 --> 18:33.304
- Hi.
- Why don't we, uh,
head back to your room.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.570
I'm sure that's what
your mom would want.

18:44.286 --> 18:46.982
So, I'm guessing
you're a sports fan.

18:49.457 --> 18:51.550
Which one's your favorite?

18:51.626 --> 18:55.619
Well, it used
to be basketball,

18:55.697 --> 18:59.497
but now the Bulls suck,
so I think maybe baseball.

18:59.568 --> 19:01.661
I like baseball too.

19:09.711 --> 19:11.872
Did Henry make this for you?

19:16.685 --> 19:18.778
[Bell Ringing]

19:27.262 --> 19:29.924
[Chuckles]

19:29.998 --> 19:33.957

- Yeah.

when I was in the hospital.

everything happens for a reason.

where he might have gone?

21:45.300 --> 21:47.665

I assume.

21:47.798 --> 21:50.028
He has no record
of any kind, Mulder.

He doesn't earn enough

no checking account, no insurance.

stayed off the radar.

22:04.181 --> 22:07.344
He's retired from the world.

22:07.418 --> 22:09.750
Ever since December 1989.

22:11.488 --> 22:13.956
That's when a commuter jet
crashed into Lake Michigan...

22:14.024 --> 22:16.117
carrying 21 passengers.

22:16.193 --> 22:18.423

- Henry.

Yeah. That's how
he lost his eye.

22:21.665 --> 22:24.259

He'd been bumped from three flights...

for him on that fateful plane.

22:27.738 --> 22:31.105

- Thirteen?

22:31.175 --> 22:33.973
- Of flight seven.
- More good luck you're saying?

22:34.044 --> 22:36.638
Call it good or bad, but maybe
that's where it all started.

22:36.714 --> 22:40.275
What if a brand-new Henry Weems
was plucked from the wreckage...

22:40.350 --> 22:43.581
one whose fortunes had been
irrevocably permanently changed?

22:43.654 --> 22:48.489
Before 1989, Henry held down a job
for nine years at a train yard.

22:48.559 --> 22:52.757
But after the accident, as you said,
it's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.958
He severed ties with all his friends
and moved out to Melrose Park.

22:56.033 --> 23:00.527
Mulder, there are millions of reasons
for that, including survivor's guilt.

23:00.604 --> 23:04.472

Henry Weems would drop off the map...

23:04.541 --> 23:06.839
just because he suddenly
became incredibly lucky.

23:06.910 --> 23:09.674
What doesn't track for me is why
he's resurfaced after all these years.

to use his luck in this way.

initially won the money?
- Mm-hmm.

And once you and he ascertained that
the accident victim was still alive,

25:19.042 --> 25:21.067

- He's too smart for that.
- It makes it very hard for us
to obtain a search warrant.

37:41.047 --> 37:43.413
- We'll get one, though.
- When?

37:43.483 --> 37:46.885
Tomorrow? Next week?

37:47.018 --> 37:49.486
Could someone sit
with him at least?

37:49.554 --> 37:52.682
Hold up, Henry. What if
what I said before wasn't true?

37:52.757 --> 37:57.717
That your luck hasn't changed? Maybe
all this is happening for a reason.

37:57.795 --> 38:01.822
So you're saying that Maggie
getting taken is a good thing?

38:01.900 --> 38:05.768
No, I'm saying that what looks like it
might be bad luck may not be bad luck.

38:05.837 --> 38:08.271
That we can't tell yet.
We're not in that position.

38:08.339 --> 38:10.739
We can't see the forest
for the trees.

38:22.086 --> 38:24.884
How is he?

38:24.956 --> 38:29.552
Not good. If we don't find a donor
in the next few hours...

38:32.597 --> 38:35.896
Scully, what if everybody that becomes
involved in Henry Weems' life...

38:35.967 --> 38:39.368
somehow becomes an integral part
of his luck, including you and I?

38:40.638 --> 38:43.106
Mulder, you're speaking
as if we're all trapped...

38:43.174 --> 38:45.233
in one of those contraptions
that he built.

38:48.112 --> 38:50.945
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Maggie Lupone.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.585
Luck is the overreaching force
in this investigation.

39:00.658 --> 39:02.853
I say we roll with it.

39:08.399 --> 39:11.493
- Yeah. Let's call that a dry run.
- Yeah.

39:21.079 --> 39:23.604
[Elevator Bell Dings]

39:27.518 --> 39:29.782
Look who came calling.

39:33.891 --> 39:37.486
I wanted to tell you personally
that there's no hard feelings.

39:37.562 --> 39:39.996
I'm not testifying
against you.

39:41.165 --> 39:44.134
Just let Maggie Lupone go.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.129
Maggie?

39:48.206 --> 39:50.367
I don't know anybody named Maggie.

39:51.409 --> 39:53.673
You know anybody named Maggie?

39:53.745 --> 39:55.679
[Laughing]

39:55.747 --> 39:57.681
Fellas, don't jerk me around.

39:57.749 --> 40:00.479
Jerk you around?

40:00.551 --> 40:03.247
You tried to cheat me
out of a hundred large,

40:03.321 --> 40:06.154
you kill Angie,
you put Sal in the hospital.

40:06.224 --> 40:08.215
I'm jerkin' you around?

40:10.895 --> 40:13.693
I apologize for my choice of words.

40:13.765 --> 40:16.632
Please, just let her go.

40:16.701 --> 40:19.101
Her kid's really sick.

40:20.805 --> 40:22.830
I don't care what happens to me.

40:22.907 --> 40:24.841
You'll care.

40:26.344 --> 40:29.177
By the time I'm finished,

40:29.247 --> 40:31.977
you'll definitely care.

40:41.926 --> 40:43.860
Henry?

40:43.928 --> 40:46.920
Richie, how is he?

40:49.067 --> 40:50.864
Not that one.

40:50.935 --> 40:53.529
Use the small one.

40:53.604 --> 40:55.697
Hey!

40:57.642 --> 40:59.576
Henry?

41:15.326 --> 41:18.352
[Groaning]

41:18.429 --> 41:21.421
Don't you hurt him,
you son of a bitch!

41:21.499 --> 41:23.399
Shut her up!

41:31.776 --> 41:33.710
[Grunting]

41:37.348 --> 41:39.373
[Maggie]
Henry!

42:04.842 --> 42:06.605
[Gasps]

42:08.045 --> 42:09.979
Oh!

42:22.760 --> 42:24.853
[Man]
Check downstairs!

42:46.918 --> 42:49.614
[Mulder] What are the odds
for Catrona being a perfect match?

42:49.687 --> 42:53.282
- A thousand to one? A million to one?
- Maybe higher.

42:55.259 --> 42:57.523
Maybe everything
does happen for a reason.

42:59.096 --> 43:01.792
Whether we see it or not.

43:07.638 --> 43:09.629
Maybe your luck is changing.

43:09.707 --> 43:12.471
Maybe.

43:16.347 --> 43:18.281
[Bell Ringing]

44:09.631 --> 44:11.633
[Child]
I made this!
