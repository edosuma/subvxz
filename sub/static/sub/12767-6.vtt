10:02.709 --> 10:04.500
OH, NO, SAM. I TOLD YOU.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.041
I'M NOT GONNA PUT HER
IN A NURSING HOME.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.458
I PROMISED HER
THAT I WOULDN'T YEARS AGO.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.917
WE PROMISED EACH OTHER.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.458
CIRCUMSTANCES
WERE DIFFERENT THEN.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.458
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE ALZHEIMER'S.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.458
SAM, I PROMISED HER.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.333
WHEN SHE DIES,
SHE DIES IN MY ARMS--

10:19.375 --> 10:22.709
NOT WITH STRANGERS,
IN MY ARMS.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.583
SHE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.500
I WILL NOT PUT
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE...

10:28.542 --> 10:31.000
IN A HOME.

10:33.083 --> 10:36.375
(drill whirring)

10:36.417 --> 10:39.125
(jackhammer pounding)

10:39.166 --> 10:40.583
NO, ADDISON, WAIT.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.458
HI, THERE.
THANK YOU FOR SEEING US
SO LAST MINUTE.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.250
DANIEL PULLED ME OUT OF CLASS.

10:46.291 --> 10:49.667
HE SAID WE HAD TO HAVE
AN ULTRASOUND TODAY.
(whispers) I WAS TRYING
TO WARN YOU.

10:49.709 --> 10:52.458
I HAVE AN O.B., BUT DANIEL SAID
YOU WERE THE BEST.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.375
UH, I'M SORRY. UH, MISS--
THIS IS AMY, MY WIFE.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.583
YOU HAVE TWO WIVES?

10:59.625 --> 11:02.125
HE HAS TWO WIVES.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
NO. DANIEL--

11:02.166 --> 11:05.041
I DIDN'T PLAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.542
I'VE BEEN HAPPILY MARRIED
TO AMY FOR 12 YEARS.

11:07.583 --> 11:12.041
BUT THEN THREE YEARS AGO,
I MET LAURA. WE FELL IN LOVE.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.291
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER?
PLEASE.
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.041
IT'S A PRETTY DUMB MOVE...

11:17.083 --> 11:19.750
BRINGING TWO WIVES
TO THE SAME MEDICAL PRACTICE.

11:19.792 --> 11:21.041
WHEN YOU FOUND
THE ABNORMALITY,

11:21.083 --> 11:24.000
I WORRIED AMY'S DOCTORS
HAD MISSED SOMETHING.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.000
AMY'S DUE DATE'S
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.792
I COULDN'T RISK SOMETHING
GOING WRONG WITH HER DELIVERY,

11:28.834 --> 11:31.041
WITH OUR BABY.
I SHOULD THROW YOU OUT OF HERE.
I SHOULD, BUT I WON'T.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.542
I'LL GO AHEAD
AND DO THE ULTRASOUND

11:33.583 --> 11:35.542
BECAUSE YOUR WIFE--THAT WIFE--
AND HER UNBORN CHILD

11:35.583 --> 11:37.458
ARE THE VICTIMS HERE.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
I'M DOING IT FOR THEM, NOT YOU.
LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.542
SO, AMY, YOU'RE A TEACHER?

11:52.583 --> 11:55.166
THIRD GRADE. I LOVE KIDS.
I ALWAYS HAVE.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.041
WE WANT A BIG FAMILY.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.792
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE WELL ON YOUR WAY.

11:59.834 --> 12:03.583
EVERYTHING'S OKAY?
YOU SEE THAT FLICKERING
RIGHT THERE?

12:03.625 --> 12:06.041
THAT IS
YOUR BABY'S HEARTBEAT.
IT'S SO FAST.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S NORMAL. YOUR BABY IS
PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.917
WHEW.
THANK YOU, DR. MONTGOMERY.

12:11.959 --> 12:13.166
THANK YOU.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.083
YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.000
AMY.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.583
YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT CHARLOTTE.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.041
I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T.
THEY GUESSED.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.250
AND WHAT DO YOU CARE?

12:24.291 --> 12:27.041
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WALKED OUT
OF THE BAR WITH CRUELLA.

12:27.083 --> 12:30.041
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARLOTTE
IS MINE, NOT YOURS, TO SHARE

12:30.083 --> 12:33.667
OR MOCK OR... CALL CRUELLA.
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO OUTED
YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.083
YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.
I'M SORRY.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.083
I HAD A FEW TOO MANY DRINKS
AND I DID A SPONTANEOUS THING,

12:39.125 --> 12:41.083
AND NOW EVERYBODY
KNOWS ABOUT IT,

12:41.125 --> 12:43.875
AND THAT'S...
IT MAKES IT REAL.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.333
IT'S VERY, VERY...
VERY REAL.

12:46.375 --> 12:49.041
WELL, REAL IS A GOOD THING,
RIGHT?

12:49.083 --> 12:51.041
YEAH, I GUESS.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.834
OKAY, LOOK...

12:52.875 --> 12:56.041
IT'S TRUE
THAT I DON'T LIKE CRUELLA--

12:56.083 --> 12:59.500
CHARLOTTE--
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN...

12:59.542 --> 13:03.041
COOP, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE AFRAID TO HOPE,

13:03.083 --> 13:05.083
TO WANT IT TO WORK OUT.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.041
HOPING IS HEALTHY.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.959
REAL IS A GOOD THING?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.166
REAL'S A GOOD THING.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.041
(jackhammer pounding)

13:15.083 --> 13:17.125
WE ARE TRYING TO WORK
UP HERE!

13:17.166 --> 13:19.041
THAT'LL HELP.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.083
IT'S DISRUPTING THE WORKPLACE.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO'S BEHIND IT.

13:22.125 --> 13:24.875
ADDISON CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
I'M GONNA DO IT MYSELF.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.875
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?
I WISH I COULD, NANCY DREW,
BUT I HAVE CHILDREN TO HEAL.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.875
FINE, FINE.
I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.083
(jackhammering continues)

13:32.125 --> 13:33.875
HEY, SAM.
YEAH.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.875
I AM THINKING WE SHOULD HIT
A BAR TONIGHT AFTER WORK...

13:36.917 --> 13:38.041
OH.
TRY AGAIN.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.041
THERE ARE SO MANY
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN L.A.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.834
PETE, NAOMI AND I,

13:41.875 --> 13:43.834
WE JUST CAME OUT
OF A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.834
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY TO--

13:45.875 --> 13:48.834
SAM, COOPER IS DATING.
WELL, COOPER IS DATING
THE ANTICHRIST.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.834
WELL, AT LEAST HE'S DATING.
YOU GOTTA GET BACK OUT THERE.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.959
I AM MAKING IT MY MISSION
TO GET YOU A DATE.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.959
(laughs) OKAY.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
HEY.
UH... WE WERE JUST--

14:00.041 --> 14:02.041
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.000
FRANCES JUST HAD AN ACCIDENT.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.709
I WAS HELPING HER
OUT OF THE TUB,

14:09.750 --> 14:12.959
AND SHE FELL AND HIT HER HEAD,
AND I-I TRIED TO CATCH HER.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
RELAX, RELAX. ALL RIGHT,
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S HIGH

14:17.041 --> 14:19.041
AND YOUR PULSE IS IRREGULAR.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.542
HOW'S FRANNY?
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD,

14:20.583 --> 14:22.959
BUT, UH, WE'LL--WE'LL TALK TO
THE ATTENDING BEFORE WE GO.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.333
HELEN...
PLEASE TAKE ME HOME.

14:25.375 --> 14:28.959
I WANT TO GO HOME.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU HOME
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
THIS SITUATION
IS GETTING DANGEROUS

14:31.041 --> 14:32.458
FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.458
OH, DON'T START WITH ME
AGAIN, SAM.
DID THEY DO A C.T. SCAN

14:35.500 --> 14:37.667
BEFORE DIAGNOSING HER
WITH ALZHEIMER'S?

14:37.709 --> 14:41.041
HER DOCTOR SAID
SHE DIDN'T NEED ANOTHER TEST.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.792
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

14:42.834 --> 14:46.625
EVERYTHING'S FINE, HENRY.
IT'S FINE.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.041
IS THE HUSBAND HERE?

14:51.083 --> 14:54.000
OH, THE HUSBAND JUST LEFT
WITH THE OTHER WIFE.

14:54.041 --> 14:55.625
(knock on door)

14:55.667 --> 14:57.208
LAURA, HI.
I'M DR. FREEDMAN.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.667
HI.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.417
COME ON, LAURA.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.041
LAURA...

15:05.083 --> 15:08.291
THE BABY TESTED POSITIVE
FOR DiGEORGE SYNDROME.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.166
(gasps)
(Cooper)
HERE IS SOME INFORMATION

15:10.208 --> 15:13.000
THAT'S GONNA HELP YOU
UNDERSTAND THE DISORDER,

15:13.041 --> 15:16.500
AND WE CAN GO OVER
ALL OF IT WITH YOU.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.333
WILL SHE...
WILL SHE SURVIVE?

15:21.375 --> 15:23.333
SHE'LL SURVIVE DELIVERY,

15:23.375 --> 15:26.041
BUT LIFE... FOR A CHILD
WITH DiGEORGE SYNDROME

15:26.083 --> 15:29.083
IS... DIFFICULT.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.875
DiGEORGE SYNDROME
IS A GENETIC DISORDER,

15:31.917 --> 15:34.834
AND IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH
CARDIAC, HORMONAL

15:34.875 --> 15:36.542
AND FACIAL ABNORMALITIES.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.083
SHE'S GONNA REQUIRE SURGERY--
A NUMBER OF SURGERIES.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.041
AND SHE'LL NEED A LIFETIME
OF MEDICAL TREATMENT

15:41.083 --> 15:43.041
WITH ROUND-THE-CLOCK CARE.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.041
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
DR. WILDER?

15:45.083 --> 15:47.041
PARENTS IN YOUR SITUATION--
ABOUT HALF OF THEM

15:47.083 --> 15:49.667
DECIDE TO GO THROUGH
WITH THE PREGNANCY.

15:49.709 --> 15:53.041
THE OTHER HALF DE--
OH, GOD. NO.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.959
END THE PREGNANCY?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
WE TRIED FOR SO LONG
TO GET PREGNANT.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.166
IT TOOK ALMOST A YEAR.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.458
I... I JUST...
I'M NOT READY--

16:02.500 --> 16:06.000
I'M NOT READY TO HEAR THIS.
I NEED MY HUSBAND HERE.

16:09.542 --> 16:11.417
(elevator bell dings)

16:22.959 --> 16:25.041
SO IF--IF WE...

16:32.083 --> 16:33.333
YOU'RE THE ONE RESPONSIBLE

16:33.375 --> 16:35.333
FOR ALL THIS DRILLING
AND BANGING?

16:35.375 --> 16:38.041
I TRY TO AVOID MANUAL LABOR,
BUT I AM LEASING THE SPACE.

16:38.083 --> 16:42.291
FOR WHAT?
I'M OPENING
A NEW MEDICAL PRACTICE.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.291
YOU'RE OPENING A PRACTICE HERE?
WHAT ABOUT COOPER?

16:45.333 --> 16:47.625
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.
HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.917
THIS IS BUSINESS,
AND COOPER IS PERSONAL.

16:49.959 --> 16:53.041
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
MAYBE NOT FOR YOU,
BUT I AM NOT A THERAPIST.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.625
I DON'T HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS

16:55.667 --> 16:58.542
UNTIL EVERYONE ELSE'S EARS
BLEED.
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.041
I DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.959
IF YOU DON'T DO IT,
THEN I WILL.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.667
FINE. I'LL TELL HIM.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.458
IT'S DISGUSTING.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.250
IT'S DISGUSTING AND CRUEL.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.750
I MEAN, HE IS USING
THESE TWO WOMEN.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.750
WE--WE HAVE TO TELL THEM.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.041
WHAT OUR PATIENTS DO
OUTSIDE THIS PRACTICE

17:15.083 --> 17:17.250
IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
OH, COME ON, PETE.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.041
I'M NOT SAYING I LIKE IT.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.625
I'M SAYING WE DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING

17:21.667 --> 17:23.750
TO EITHER OF THESE WOMEN.
BUT IF LAURA DOES DECIDE
TO HAVE THIS CHILD,

17:23.792 --> 17:25.750
SHE'S DOING SO
UNDER THE MISTAKEN BELIEF

17:25.792 --> 17:28.875
THAT SHE HAS A LOYAL
AND COMMITTED HUSBAND

17:28.917 --> 17:30.875
TO SHARE THE BURDEN
WITH HER.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.875
I DON'T CONDONE
DANIEL'S BEHAVIOR.
(sighs)

17:32.917 --> 17:35.041
BUT THE FACT
THAT HE'S MARRIED TO TWO WOMEN

17:35.083 --> 17:37.417
DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S NOT
COMMITTED TO STAYING LOYAL

17:37.458 --> 17:39.875
TO BOTH OF THEM
AND THE CHILDREN.
HE IS A LIAR,
AND HE SHOULDN'T--

17:39.917 --> 17:42.417
YOU KNOW...
HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO RAISE
THOSE CHILDREN.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.583
THAT'S AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE,
NOT A MEDICAL ONE.

17:44.625 --> 17:48.375
HE'S THEIR FATHER.
SO THAT GIVES HIM A FREE PASS
TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS?

17:48.417 --> 17:51.041
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T YOU EVEN THINK

17:51.083 --> 17:53.583
ABOUT SAYING A WORD
TO EITHER OF THOSE WOMEN,

17:53.625 --> 17:56.709
OR I WILL PERSONALLY REPORT YOU
TO THE A.M.A.
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

17:56.750 --> 17:59.166
DON'T SAY A WORD.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.000
FINE.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.834
I WON'T SAY A WORD.

18:07.959 --> 18:10.333
DIDN'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS?

18:10.375 --> 18:13.083
(sighs)

18:13.125 --> 18:16.083
WE DID.
LOOK, I CAN MAKE IT WORK.

18:16.125 --> 18:19.208
WHY IS THIS SO URGENT, DELL?

18:19.250 --> 18:22.041
OKAY, YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.041
I STILL DON'T WANT YOU
USING THIS SPACE.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.041
I NEED YOU TO GET LAURA LARSON
AND AMY LARSON

18:27.083 --> 18:30.625
BACK IN HERE AGAIN TODAY
AT THE SAME TIME.
OKAY.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.875
(knock on door)

18:32.917 --> 18:35.625
LISTEN, UH, ABOUT PETE
AND THIS DATING THING--

18:35.667 --> 18:38.125
I THINK FRANCES
MIGHT NOT HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.959
"NORMAL PRESSURE
HYDROCEPHALUS"?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.375
YEAH, HER C.T. SCAN SHOWED
NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE TRAUMA.

18:46.417 --> 18:49.667
BUT THERE WAS MARKED DILATATION
IN THE VENTRICLES.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.709
NOW N.P.H. AND ALZHEIMER'S
HAVE SIMILAR SYMPTOMS.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.709
OKAY, BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

18:53.750 --> 18:55.250
HER BODY IS TOO FRAIL

18:55.291 --> 18:57.709
FOR HER TO BE A CANDIDATE
FOR A NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURE.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.709
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS A STUDY

18:59.750 --> 19:01.709
THAT WAS DONE
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

19:01.750 --> 19:03.709
IN WHICH A SPINAL TAP
WAS PERFORMED

19:03.750 --> 19:06.625
TO DRAIN THE EXCESS FLUID
OFF OF PATIENTS WITH N.P.H.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.375
NOW IF SHE HAS THIS, THE TAP
COULD RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS

19:09.417 --> 19:11.959
AND GIVE HER
A FEW BRIEF PERIODS OF CLARITY.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.041
WELL, THAT'S A BIG IF, NAOMI.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.792
IT'S WORTH A TRY.
THE ONLY BLESSING
OF THIS DISEASE IS THAT

19:16.834 --> 19:19.417
SHE'S NOT COGNIZANT ENOUGH TO
UNDERSTAND HER OWN SITUATION.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.083
DO YOU WANT HER TO UNDERSTAND
HOW BAD THINGS ARE?

19:22.125 --> 19:25.083
I WANT HER TO UNDERSTAND
HOW BAD THINGS ARE FOR HENRY.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.834
SO THEN YOU'D PUT HER THROUGH
A SPINAL TAP?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.041
IF--IF THIS WERE ME,
IF THIS WERE YOU AND ME--

19:30.083 --> 19:33.041
THIS IS NOT YOU AND ME.
I KNOW THAT.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.166
WELL, THIS IS
A SHOT IN THE DARK, NAOMI.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.959
THE FRANCES I KNEW

19:37.000 --> 19:38.959
WOULD NOT HAVE WANTED THIS
FOR EITHER OF THEM,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.959
AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CONVINCE HENRY

19:41.000 --> 19:42.750
TO DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.166
(drilling, sawing
and jackhammering noises)

19:44.208 --> 19:46.959
HEY, UH, LAURA LARSON
AND AMY LARSON ARE HERE.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.625
PUT AMY IN EXAM ROOM FOUR.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.041
WHICH EXAM ROOM DO YOU WANT
TO PUT LAURA IN?

19:52.083 --> 19:54.625
LET ME WORRY ABOUT LAURA.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.750
IS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE WRONG?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.166
NO. UH, NO. NO, NO.

20:12.208 --> 20:16.458
I-I... I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE

20:16.500 --> 20:19.041
ALL THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU NEED.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.375
OKAY.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.041
OH.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.000
OOPS. UH, THE ROOM'S TAKEN.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.000
I'M SO SORRY. DELL MUST HAVE
MADE A MISTAKE.

20:27.041 --> 20:31.083
UM, DO THE TWO OF YOU MIND
HANGING OUT IN HERE FOR A MOMENT

20:31.125 --> 20:33.041
WHILE I CLEAR THIS UP?
THAT'S FINE.

20:35.959 --> 20:39.333
TWO NEW MOMS. I'M SURE
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.291
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.208
NOTHING.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.291
WHAT DID YOU DO?

20:50.333 --> 20:53.250
I DID NOT SAY A WORD.
(Amy) JUST GET AWAY FROM ME!

20:53.291 --> 20:56.041
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

20:56.083 --> 21:00.959
WHAT DID YOU DO?

21:04.959 --> 21:06.750
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.
YOU GOT AROUND IT
BY A LEGAL TECHNICALITY.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.083
EXACTLY, BECAUSE THEY HAD
THE RIGHT TO KNOW.
WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT,

21:09.125 --> 21:13.083
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO ORCHESTRATE THAT.
I DID WHAT I WOULD WANT
SOMEONE TO DO FOR ME, PETE.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.250
YOU OVERSTEPPED.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TODAY?
(door opens)

21:16.291 --> 21:18.458
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

21:18.500 --> 21:20.458
HOW LONG DID YOU THINK
YOU COULD KEEP UP THIS CHARADE?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.250
WHAT PART OF MY LIFE
ARE YOU CALLING A CHARADE?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.041
TAKE IT EASY.

21:25.083 --> 21:28.041
I'VE BEEN WITH AMY
SINCE I WAS 21.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.125
SHE'S THE WOMAN I'VE BEEN
HAPPILY MARRIED TO FOR 12 YEARS.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.250
SO HAPPILY THAT YOU WENT OUT
LOOKING FOR OTHER WOMEN?
I NEVER STOPPED LOVING AMY,

21:34.291 --> 21:36.583
BUT WHEN I MET LAURA,
IT WAS...

21:36.625 --> 21:39.542
I--HAVE YOU EVER MET SOMEONE
AND JUST KNOWN

21:39.583 --> 21:42.500
THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN YOU
YOU COULDN'T RESIST,

21:42.542 --> 21:44.125
EVEN IF YOU TRIED?

21:44.166 --> 21:46.583
I COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF
THOSE GUYS WITH A WIFE AT HOME

21:46.625 --> 21:49.041
AND A GIRLFRIEND ON THE SIDE,
BUT I MARRIED THEM BOTH

21:49.083 --> 21:51.333
BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.
YOU'RE LIVING A LIE, DANIEL.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.667
YOU'RE CHEATING ON TWO WOMEN,

21:53.709 --> 21:58.000
AND CHEATING RUINS LIVES.

22:01.875 --> 22:06.041
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO RUINED LIVES HERE TODAY.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.917
UM, AS THE KIDS WOULD SAY,
DRAMA.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.125
ADDISON'S PATIENTS?
I THINK IT'S SO SAD.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.417
SAD BUT WEIRD.

22:23.458 --> 22:28.041
SAD BUT FODDER FOR THE BEST
DINNER PARTY STORY EVER.

22:28.083 --> 22:31.500
ADDISON HAS--
SHE'S GONE CRAZY AND...

22:31.542 --> 22:34.375
(singsong voice) I LOVE IT!

22:34.417 --> 22:36.375
(normal voice)
WHY THE COLD SHOULDER?

22:36.417 --> 22:38.375
I'M NOT--I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE COLD SHOULDER.

22:38.417 --> 22:40.000
I'M JUST--
I'M--I'M DISTRACTED.

22:42.041 --> 22:44.125
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.959
YOU DO?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.458
IT'S CHARLOTTE.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.792
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
BEFORE I OUTED US. I'M SORRY.

22:56.291 --> 23:00.250
(saw whirring)

23:00.291 --> 23:03.166
YOU CAN'T WALK OUT.
IT'S YOUR OFFICE.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.041
(jackhammer pounding)

23:06.083 --> 23:09.041
HE WAS NEVER
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.041
HE HAD THESE WOMEN THINKING THAT
HE'S ONE THING, BUT HE'S NOT.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.041
AND THE WORSE PART IS...
(BlackBerry buzzing)

23:14.083 --> 23:16.041
HE ONLY FELT BAD
BECAUSE HE'D BEEN EXPOSED,

23:16.083 --> 23:18.166
NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE'D DONE.
(buzzing stops)

23:18.208 --> 23:20.041
YOU DON'T LOOK SURPRISED.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.709
WELL, PEOPLE LIE.
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

23:22.750 --> 23:24.792
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY GUYS
ON THE FORCE

23:24.834 --> 23:26.583
HAVE SOMETHING ON THE SIDE?
(chuckles)

23:26.625 --> 23:28.875
I SHOULD KNOW. I'M THEIR ALIBI
HALF THE TIME.

23:28.917 --> 23:31.500
AND YOU COVER FOR THEM WHILE
THEY'RE OUT HAVING AFFAIRS?
THESE GUYS
ARE LIKE MY BROTHERS.

23:31.542 --> 23:33.458
WHAT ABOUT THEIR WIVES
BACK HOME,

23:33.500 --> 23:36.458
JUST TOO BAD FOR THEM?
I'M NOT ENCOURAGING IT,
ADDISON.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.458
I'M JUST SAYING IT HAPPENS.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.458
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.709
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
LAST NIGHT?

23:44.750 --> 23:46.458
WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

23:46.500 --> 23:49.834
(BlackBerry buzzes)

23:49.875 --> 23:51.333
(exhales)

23:51.375 --> 23:54.083

IT'S A WORK THING.

24:07.667 --> 24:09.125
WE'LL TALK LATER, OKAY?

24:09.166 --> 24:11.166
MM.

24:15.959 --> 24:18.333
(exhales deeply)

24:18.375 --> 24:20.709
(elevator bell dings)

24:20.750 --> 24:23.041
UH, I JUST TALKED TO HENRY,

24:23.083 --> 24:25.583
AND HE'S AGREED TO DO
THE SPINAL TAP.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.083
OH, ALL RIGHT. WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

24:28.125 --> 24:31.083
LOOK, SAM, I KNOW YOU DON'T
AGREE WITH ME ON THIS ONE--

24:31.125 --> 24:33.458
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.
ALL RIGHT?

24:33.500 --> 24:36.458
YOU'RE PUTTING FRANCES
AT RISK.
FOR HENRY, FOR FRANCES.

24:36.500 --> 24:40.000
I HOPE IT IS FOR THEM...
AND NOT FOR YOU.

24:42.083 --> 24:44.041
(cell phone rings)

24:44.083 --> 24:45.667
HEY, ADDISON.

24:45.709 --> 24:48.291
I think I may have just
gone too far.
With what?

24:48.333 --> 24:51.208
I FOLLOWED KEVIN.
WHAT DO--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU FOLLOWED HIM?

24:51.250 --> 24:54.166
AT FIRST IT WAS JUST
A ROUTINE SURVEILLANCE.
You are not a cop.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.166
I FOLLOWED HIM TO WORK,
TO THE PRECINCT,

24:56.208 --> 24:59.041
WHICH IS APPARENTLY
WHERE I SHOULD'VE STOPPED.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.625
OH, GOD. WHERE--WHERE
ARE YOU NOW, CRAZY WOMAN?
I'm not insane.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.542
I WENT TO THE PRECINCT.
FIVE MINUTES LATER,

25:03.583 --> 25:06.166
HE COMES ROARING OUT
OF THE PARKING GARAGE

25:06.208 --> 25:08.500
IN ANOTHER CAR, A VAN.
Did it--did it not occur to you
that he might be working?

25:08.542 --> 25:10.208
OF COURSE HE COULD BE WORKING.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.208
ONLY MAYBE HE'S NOT WORKING.
PEOPLE LIE, NAI.

25:12.250 --> 25:15.166
They lie and they cheat
and they ruin people's lives,

25:15.208 --> 25:17.959

THOSE WOMEN WHO GETS DUPED.

WHY'D YOU BRING US HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD TALK.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.583
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.667

THIS IS MY FAULT SOMEHOW.

I DON'T WANT HELP FROM HER.

PETE, WE SHOULDN'T--
WE SHOULD.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.291

WHERE'S THE MUSIC?

29:57.375 --> 30:00.041

SUPPOSED TO BE MUSIC.

30:00.083 --> 30:02.750
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.
THE WORST IS OVER.

30:02.792 --> 30:05.500
NO, LOOK AT HER. I NEVER
SHOULD'VE PUT HER THROUGH THIS.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.125
THIS MAY WORK, HENRY,

30:07.166 --> 30:09.959

AT LEAST SOMETHING.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.041

EVEN FOR A MINUTE,

30:13.083 --> 30:16.041
LOOK INTO HER EYES

30:16.083 --> 30:18.083
REALLY SEES ME.

30:23.041 --> 30:25.041
OKAY, AMY...

30:25.083 --> 30:27.333
YOU'RE ABOUT
8 CENTIMETERS DILATED.

30:27.375 --> 30:30.583
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
DANIEL WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

30:30.625 --> 30:33.583
IF YOU WANT ME TO,
I'LL CALL HIM.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.792

TO BE ALONE.

THE TRUTH YET.

YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT
LETTING THINGS GO, ARE YOU?

30:48.667 --> 30:52.500

I THINK YOU'RE SCARED.

30:52.542 --> 30:54.250

30:56.291 --> 30:59.125
SO YOU'RE JUST AS SCARED
AS COOPER IS.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.333
SO YOU'RE TRYING
TO SABOTAGE IT.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.250
TAKE A NEW JOB,
RENT THE FLOOR UNDER HIM,

31:03.291 --> 31:04.750
KEEP IT FROM HIM--

31:04.792 --> 31:07.250
YOU WANT THIS
TO BLOW UP IN YOUR FACE.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.542
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

31:09.583 --> 31:11.542
I THINK YOU'RE NOT
HALF THE SHRINK
