WEBVTT

00:11.150 --> 00:14.260
Snacks disappearing from the snack bar?! Holes in the walls?!

00:14.290 --> 00:16.980
500 dollars worth of prank phone calls?! It's ridiculous!

00:16.980 --> 00:19.380
What are you doing to my park Beanteen?

00:19.430 --> 00:22.740
But sir it's not my fault, it's Mordecai and Rigby.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.020
It's right here in my report.

00:24.020 --> 00:27.130
Are you my park manager, Beanteen?

00:27.130 --> 00:27.870
Yes sir.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.310
Then everything that happens here is your fault!

00:30.310 --> 00:32.390
Well, yes, technically but--

00:32.390 --> 00:33.480
Say it.

00:34.110 --> 00:36.880
Everything that happens here is my fault.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.990
My car!

00:42.130 --> 00:44.700
Sorry Benson, remember how I told you that I could drive stick?

00:44.700 --> 00:46.220
Well, I'm a little rusty.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.510
I told you you should have let me be the one to park it.

00:48.510 --> 00:50.510
Why are they driving my car

00:50.510 --> 00:52.820
when I specifically told YOU to park it?!

00:52.820 --> 00:57.170
I did, sir, but I delegated it to Mordecai and Rigby.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.140
Uh, this is getting a little awkward

01:00.160 --> 01:01.870
so we're gonna take off.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.550
Wait!

01:05.870 --> 01:08.110
That's it! Emergency meeting tomorrow!

01:08.110 --> 01:10.000
Things are gonna change around here.

01:11.970 --> 01:14.910
I'm sure you're all anxious to get back to work so let me make this brief,

01:14.910 --> 01:16.780
- Beancan you're being demoted. - What?!

01:16.780 --> 01:18.300
Everyone, this is Susan.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.410
She'll be taking over Beanton's duties at the park.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.510
Thank you Mr. Maellard.

01:21.510 --> 01:23.520
First, I like to thank Benson

01:23.520 --> 01:26.350
for agreeing to step down from his position.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.010
What?!

01:27.010 --> 01:31.070
I know this park's productivity has been inadequate for a long time.

01:31.230 --> 01:32.280
But now that I'm here,

01:32.280 --> 01:35.550
we're gonna get this park back in working order the Susan way.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.050
So Pops and Skips,

01:37.050 --> 01:39.230
I need you to clean the north-end fountain,

01:39.230 --> 01:42.230
Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are on snack bar duty,

01:42.280 --> 01:43.850
Mordecai and Rigby...

01:43.850 --> 01:44.930
...and Benson,

01:44.950 --> 01:46.890
you guys will be raking the leaves.

01:46.890 --> 01:47.730
What?

01:50.920 --> 01:53.810
Come on, Benson, we gotta rake these leaves, dude.

01:53.810 --> 01:54.940
I can't do this.

01:54.940 --> 01:57.010
Look, you're bummed out about getting demoted,

01:57.010 --> 01:59.260
but if you give it a chance, you'll see it's not that bad.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.430
This... is horrible.

02:01.430 --> 02:03.430
No it's not, you're just in a bad mood.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.430
Look, you just need to take your mind off of it for a while

02:05.430 --> 02:06.450
and have some fun.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.229
Yeah man, we can come back later and finish these leaves.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.150
Ha, this is so typical.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.090
You get bored so you just slack off

02:13.090 --> 02:14.820
instead of finishing your work.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.120
It's not slacking, we're just taking a break and besides,

02:17.120 --> 02:19.430
it's not like you're working that hard anyway.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.070
Yeah, you're raking like an old man that has a fatter old man

02:22.070 --> 02:23.210
holding his arms down.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.910
I don't feel like raking now, OKAY?!

02:25.910 --> 02:28.240
- I'm just saying. - What if Susan catches us?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.610
She'll probably fire us for not working!

02:30.660 --> 02:32.300
Dude, just calm down.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.600
We'll just pretend like we're working until she goes away.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.710
Yeah right, like anyone would ever fall for that.

02:37.710 --> 02:39.310
It always worked on you.

02:39.740 --> 02:40.660
Ugh, fine!

02:40.750 --> 02:43.240
As long as it gets me out of raking these leaves.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.630
I feel great!

03:43.680 --> 03:46.020
See, I told you all you needed was a break.

03:46.020 --> 03:47.800
Now do you feel like getting back to work?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.730
No!

03:49.730 --> 03:50.520
Wait, what?

03:50.600 --> 03:52.600
Dude, we have to go back to work eventually.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.510
Yeah right, I'm never working again.

03:55.590 --> 03:58.010
No seriously, we should go back to work.

03:58.010 --> 03:59.240
Susan's coming.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.630
Ha, what's she gonna do?

04:02.630 --> 04:04.350
Why aren't you all working?

04:05.250 --> 04:07.210
We were just washing Maellard's car,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.220
see we're washing it.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.610
Come on Benson, we're washing the car now.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.360
I'm not washing the car.

04:14.390 --> 04:16.870
Benson, why aren't you working?

04:16.899 --> 04:18.610
Cause I don't feel like it.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.320
Get back to work or I'll fire you.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.950
Yeah? Do it!

04:23.030 --> 04:24.410
Excuse me?!

04:24.410 --> 04:26.810
I've wasted my whole life at a dead-end job

04:26.810 --> 04:29.750
and I'm not wasting another second working for you.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.330
So go ahead and fire me.

04:31.390 --> 04:34.750
Okay Benson, you're fired!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.810
Come on guys, lets get out of here!

04:45.810 --> 04:48.730
Uh, actually Benson, we need this.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.350
Yeah, we need the money man.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.700
Oh well, suit yourselves, I guess,

04:52.700 --> 04:54.810
but my life is happening right now

04:54.810 --> 04:56.250
and I'm gonna go live it.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.070
Sayonara, suckers!

05:00.520 --> 05:03.230
You two! Get back to work!

05:03.830 --> 05:04.730
Faster!

05:04.940 --> 05:06.820
And you, sweep those stairs!

05:07.570 --> 05:10.530
And you, with the big head, finish those windows!

05:10.850 --> 05:15.030
Faster, faster, faster, faster, FASTER!

05:16.240 --> 05:18.090
I don't wanna work for Susan.

05:18.090 --> 05:19.010
Dude, I know.

05:19.900 --> 05:20.890
Mordecai?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.190
Ah, jobless.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.060
Not a worry in the world.

05:27.650 --> 05:29.700
Take that piece of trash for example.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.870
Normally, I do my duty as park manager and pick it up,

05:32.870 --> 05:35.580
but I say like it be someone else's problem,

05:35.620 --> 05:37.540
like nature's.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.380
You said it brother,

05:43.430 --> 05:45.290
who needs something like a job?

05:45.290 --> 05:45.930
Right.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.570
What does a job get ya?

05:47.570 --> 05:50.700
Some lousy money so you can buy things?

05:50.700 --> 05:51.490
Right.

05:51.510 --> 05:54.190
I'm Leon but my friends call my Upt,

05:54.330 --> 05:56.220
that's short for Utopia,

05:56.970 --> 05:59.120
because I'm living the dream man.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.460
- I'm a... - I know who you are Benson.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.980
Former park manager, now full-time slacker.

06:04.980 --> 06:05.910
How did you know?

06:05.910 --> 06:07.780
I used to be the park manager,

06:07.800 --> 06:11.610
and just like you, I gave it up for a life of slacking.

06:11.690 --> 06:14.160
Now, I don't worry about silly things

06:14.160 --> 06:17.320
like where Leon's gonna lay his head to sleep tonight

06:17.380 --> 06:20.480
cause sheet grats of a garbage compost is my pillow,

06:20.480 --> 06:23.190
the grease on my face is my shower.

06:23.310 --> 06:26.060
Yes sir, can't beat the life of a slacker,

06:26.120 --> 06:30.040
I'm proud to be the one to welcome you to your new life.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.920
Hey, where ya going?

06:31.920 --> 06:33.680
I gotta get my old job back.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.340
Hello? Susan?

06:36.430 --> 06:39.140
Susan, I need my old job back.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.300
What the?!

06:40.300 --> 06:42.850
- Benson, help us! - What happened?!

06:42.870 --> 06:44.380
The more we do what she says,

06:44.380 --> 06:46.230
the more we turn into... her!

06:46.230 --> 06:48.480
Well, stop doing what she says!

06:48.500 --> 06:50.260
- We can't. - Why not?

06:50.320 --> 06:53.270
Because she's standing right behind you.

06:55.910 --> 06:58.550
What are you doing back here? Get out!

06:58.550 --> 07:01.340
You're turning them into you, you can't do that!

07:01.340 --> 07:03.510
That's not how you manage a park.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.760
What would you know about running a park?

07:05.760 --> 07:07.110
I'll show you what I know.

07:07.110 --> 07:10.210
Mordecai and Rigby, start playing video games.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.050
But we're supposed to clean.

07:12.050 --> 07:14.270
Play video games or you're fired!

07:19.430 --> 07:20.480
Play harder!

07:20.510 --> 07:22.110
Come on, put your feet up.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.450
Eat this pizza while you play.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.090
That's it!

07:30.130 --> 07:32.700
Mordecai and Rigby, go back to work!

07:32.700 --> 07:34.700
No you don't, keep slacking!

07:39.470 --> 07:42.060
Look! Skips! Pops!

07:42.110 --> 07:43.890
Muscle Man and Hi Five!

07:43.890 --> 07:45.980
Susan's turned them into Susans too.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.870
Turn that off and clean up this mess!

07:48.870 --> 07:50.350
Why don't you clean it?

07:54.960 --> 07:57.540
Everybody slack off or you're fired!

08:05.370 --> 08:06.590
We did it!

08:29.040 --> 08:31.460
GET BACK TO WORK!!!!

08:31.460 --> 08:33.990
Don't listen to her, keep slacking off!

08:33.990 --> 08:36.419
NO!

08:36.460 --> 08:41.549
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH EMPLOYEES LIKE YOU!

08:45.730 --> 08:50.170
IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.

08:51.890 --> 08:52.960
Susan!

08:53.040 --> 08:54.710
What on earth do you think you're doing?!

08:54.710 --> 08:58.280
I'M RUNNING YOUR PARK FOR YOU, YOU OLD FOOL!

08:58.280 --> 09:00.400
This isn't how you run a business!

09:01.570 --> 09:04.940
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS!

09:06.330 --> 09:08.500
Beanton, Beanton!

09:08.600 --> 09:10.070
Help me, Beanton!

09:10.070 --> 09:11.420
It's Benson!

09:11.490 --> 09:15.520
And I can't do anything unless you give me my old job back!

09:15.520 --> 09:17.740
Okay, yes, yes, you have your job back!

09:17.740 --> 09:19.430
And your car keys.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.870
My car keys?!

09:21.250 --> 09:23.240
...My car keys, of course!

09:30.740 --> 09:32.200
HEY SUSAN!

09:33.130 --> 09:35.270
YOU'RE FIRED!

09:44.860 --> 09:46.030
Leon!

09:46.030 --> 09:47.260
I've got this, brother.

09:47.260 --> 09:49.770
I've already had my season in the sun,

09:49.770 --> 09:53.180
but you've still got a whole lifetime of slacking in front of ya.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.960
Actually, I changed my...

09:55.760 --> 09:58.690
Time for me to blow this slacker wonderland!

10:03.730 --> 10:05.300
Utopia.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.130
Thank you Benson,

10:26.150 --> 10:27.440
keep up the good work.

10:32.130 --> 10:34.170
All right, all right!

10:34.200 --> 10:35.920
Everybody back to work.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.490
We've gotta get this mess cleaned up, now!

10:38.550 --> 10:40.810
And that means you, Mordecai and Rigby,

10:40.810 --> 10:42.870
you better keep working after I'm gone,

10:42.870 --> 10:44.870
because if I come back and you're not,

10:44.870 --> 10:46.030
you're fired!

10:48.300 --> 10:50.110
Good to have you back Benson!

10:51.060 --> 10:52.500
You wanna go play video games?

10:52.560 --> 10:53.550
Yeah-yuh.

10:56.910 --> 10:59.050
It's good to be back.
