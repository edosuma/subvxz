WEBVTT

00:03.174 --> 00:04.666
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

00:04.926 --> 00:07.002
I guess I feel closer to God
if I'm with you.

00:07.262 --> 00:10.130
- Did you think it was gonna work on me?
- It's not a line.

00:10.390 --> 00:13.592
I don't need nothing from you! I don't
need to work at your cardealership.

00:13.852 --> 00:15.635
And I sure as hell don't need football.

00:15.895 --> 00:19.305
You have the opportunity
to become part of a team.

00:19.566 --> 00:21.141
If you don't do it tonight,

00:21.402 --> 00:23.642
you're never gonna do it
in your entire life.

00:23.904 --> 00:25.394
- It's that girl.
- Noelle?

00:25.656 --> 00:27.066
She got my son's head

00:27.226 --> 00:29.774
spinin' every which way direction.
I don't like it.

00:30.686 --> 00:32.819
Do you think maybe
we should like talk about some...

00:33.690 --> 00:35.405
ground rules,
so that we both know

00:35.665 --> 00:38.283
how we each feel,
that no one will get hurt...

00:38.544 --> 00:40.118
What are we gonna do with Gracie Bell

00:40.378 --> 00:43.079
- while we're at work?
- That's not our burden,

00:43.239 --> 00:44.544
that is our gift.

00:47.385 --> 00:49.836
Oh yeah. I think we could definitly
have her there by 7:00.

00:50.266 --> 00:52.756
- Which daycare's that?
- The good one with the waiting list.

00:53.206 --> 00:54.633
Sure, that would be great.

00:54.893 --> 00:56.426
I cannot thank you enough

00:56.686 --> 00:58.970
- for taking her so last minute.
- You saw my homework?

00:59.230 --> 01:02.223
- Why did they have an opening?
- One of the kid dropped out.

01:02.483 --> 01:04.221
Is that the one with the busy traffic?

01:04.684 --> 01:07.436
Can you hold on one second?
It's on *side street.

01:07.698 --> 01:09.646
They got a gate,
they got a surity code.

01:09.806 --> 01:13.187
- I left my homework right here.
- Was the reason they have an opening?

01:13.347 --> 01:15.111
Maybe because
of the traffic on the street.

01:15.271 --> 01:16.655
Wonderful, we'll be there.

01:18.455 --> 01:21.701
Honey, honey, it's gonna be fine.
It miraculous they took us in.

01:21.961 --> 01:24.162
Take Julie to school
and I'll take Gracie.

01:24.422 --> 01:26.122
Now wait a second. I am calm.

01:26.382 --> 01:29.584
You're a little worked up.
I think it's better you let me do it.

01:29.845 --> 01:31.916
You can take Jules.
Come here, baby girl.

01:32.388 --> 01:35.151
- Seriously, I need to find my homework.
- Say "bye, daddy."

01:35.705 --> 01:37.050
It's under the newspapers.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.885
You could've told me that earlier.

01:39.234 --> 01:41.549
Say bye to Gracie bell.
She's going to day care!

01:42.815 --> 01:43.802
Bye, y'all.

01:46.262 --> 01:49.154
Matthew, you have always
loved pancakes

01:49.657 --> 01:51.481
and I'm gonna make some.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.274
Well, that's...

01:53.534 --> 01:55.110
a lot of baking soda, Grandma.

01:55.370 --> 01:56.989
I've been making these
for 40 years.

01:57.149 --> 01:58.622
I guess I know how to do it.

01:59.449 --> 02:02.116
You usually eat about ten of these,
so hope you're hungry.

02:02.378 --> 02:06.596
Well, I'm eating this banana now,
so I might not be that hungry later.

02:07.447 --> 02:08.731
That's a joke.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.187
What are you doing?

02:12.825 --> 02:15.505
Could... Could you reach
my suitcase, please?

02:16.196 --> 02:18.549
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?

02:20.762 --> 02:22.679
Thank you.
Guatema.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.293
What, for, like, vacation?

02:28.987 --> 02:31.907
I have to go home Matt.
My family needs me.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.606
Why?
I don't understand,

02:33.766 --> 02:35.775
- 'cause you're supposed to...
- Did he tell you?

02:36.314 --> 02:37.569
I'm making my pancakes.

02:38.820 --> 02:40.665
You are in for a treat...

02:41.028 --> 02:42.656
- Sounds delicious.
- Y'all come on,

02:42.918 --> 02:44.794
you gotta get 'em
while they're hot.

02:45.197 --> 02:47.705
Matthew has loved these
since he was a little boy.

02:48.183 --> 02:50.987
I'll clean up after myself.
Don't worry about it.

02:53.228 --> 02:56.164
Yep, cmnnamon d en
a special ingrient.*

02:58.288 --> 03:00.310
Looks like a nice neighborhood.

03:04.022 --> 03:05.597
Fun little playground.

03:07.792 --> 03:09.142
Children coughing.

03:10.008 --> 03:12.312
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, Mrs. Taylor.

03:12.573 --> 03:14.464
Good.
I'll be with you inust one minute.

03:14.624 --> 03:16.107
Oh, okay, great.

03:17.772 --> 03:20.467
Well, this is such a big day for you,
Gracie Bell.

03:23.847 --> 03:26.392
eat and... play and...

03:29.130 --> 03:31.692
Nap and do all those things
that you love to do so much.

03:31.852 --> 03:33.371
You're not gonna wonder

03:33.531 --> 03:36.461
why I left you with a bunch of people
that we don't know and never met.

03:40.976 --> 03:42.080
I agree.

03:44.393 --> 03:46.534
Come on back...
tomorrow maybe.

03:48.375 --> 03:49.808
I think you're absolutely right.

03:52.088 --> 03:54.312
I think maybe today
wasn't the best day for it.

I'm proud of you.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.458

05:38.718 --> 05:40.918

05:41.387 --> 05:43.004
I'm gonna be in the streets, homie.

05:51.105 --> 05:52.997
Hi, reverend Philips,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:53.157 --> 05:54.097
It's okay.

05:54.359 --> 05:56.309
The phones are ringing off,
they're waiting.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.978
- Chris kennedy. Nice to meet you.
- Lyla Garrity.

05:59.504 --> 06:03.191
Good early morning and welcome
to <i>I was a teenage christian</i>, I'm Chris.

06:03.452 --> 06:05.567
This is Lyla, it's her first day,
be nice to her.

06:05.829 --> 06:07.402
We're on to our next caller.

06:07.664 --> 06:09.840
She has a question about sex.
Go for it, Lorena.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.239
<i>Hi, I have a question for Lyla.</i>

06:15.686 --> 06:17.178
<i>I'm 17 and a christian</i>

06:17.338 --> 06:19.957
<i>and I'm kind of confused
because I'm horny all the time.</i>

06:20.396 --> 06:22.250
<i>And my boyfriend,
who's also a christian,</i>

06:22.512 --> 06:24.820
<i>is also horny all the time
and he keeps telling me</i>

06:25.349 --> 06:27.131
<i>that all this stuff we're doing
isn't a sin</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:29.941
<i>and I guess tenically it's not...</i>

06:32.425 --> 06:34.678
Okay, what was your question exactly?

06:35.025 --> 06:38.913
<i>I guess...
Is oral sex considered intercourse?</i>

06:39.073 --> 06:41.020
<i>And even if it's not,
is it okay?</i>

06:43.605 --> 06:46.150
I'm gonna take this one for Lyla
'cause is her first day.

06:46.696 --> 06:49.404
It's a little early in the morning
to be defining intercourse

06:50.477 --> 06:53.950
Since you're asking, I'm gonna say
that technally, biblically,

06:54.505 --> 06:58.745
oral sex is not intercourse,
but I don't think that's why you called.

06:59.011 --> 07:02.000
It sounds like you're not feeling okay
about these things you're doing.

07:02.260 --> 07:03.103
Am I right?

07:03.263 --> 07:05.712
Actually, I'm not okay with a lot of.

07:07.541 --> 07:08.589
Thank you.

07:09.401 --> 07:12.217
- I'll be right back. Hey, sweetie.
- I need to talk to you.

07:12.591 --> 07:13.885
I've got a meeting with...

07:14.610 --> 07:16.973
- principal Bracker.
- Just five minutes.

07:20.111 --> 07:21.269
Hello, Glen, Gracie.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.583
I had a hard time leaving her
at daycare today.

07:24.743 --> 07:26.349
It was hard for us.

07:27.126 --> 07:28.233
I thought today...

07:29.783 --> 07:32.612
Listen, I really want to help out,
but I gotta go to class.

07:32.874 --> 07:34.158
I'll take her.

07:36.708 --> 07:38.703
Actually, you knon what,
since you're here...

07:39.048 --> 07:41.495
You want to go say hi to daddy?
Thanks, baby.

07:42.049 --> 07:44.374
It's a quick meeting.
It's just a statistics thing.

07:44.702 --> 07:47.003
- Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
- Ten!

07:47.263 --> 07:48.256
Thanks, bye.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.770
She needs to have
her diaper changed, I think.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.843
All right.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.012
- Have a good day.
- You betcha.

07:56.373 --> 07:58.730
You have a good one.
Thanks very much.

08:01.903 --> 08:03.895
I know I'm cool,
got 'em for free too.

08:04.849 --> 08:06.647
Can't even tell you where got 'em.

08:06.907 --> 08:08.691
You ain't learning nothing
from O.J, huh?

08:08.951 --> 08:12.737
- Hey, y'all fools need to go home.
- "We got jungle fever..."

08:14.245 --> 08:16.949
You can dance, red?
I didn't know you had rhythm like that.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.660
Save a little for the rest of us.
Come on, Smash.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.882
My parents want you,
your mom and your sisters

08:22.042 --> 08:23.909
to come over for dinner tomorrow night.

08:24.069 --> 08:26.501
- You think you can make it?
- Meet the parents, huh?

08:27.376 --> 08:30.254
- If you're inclined.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

08:31.128 --> 08:32.128
Good.

08:34.892 --> 08:36.635
4-4 Smash when I go a-gap...

08:37.230 --> 08:40.019
Dude, it's the Dillon Panthers!

08:42.474 --> 08:43.642
Get in the car, dog.

08:44.004 --> 08:46.604
And don't tell me
that you got homework to do, okay?

08:46.864 --> 08:49.023
'Cause I'll kick your ass.
We're riding tonight.

08:49.671 --> 08:51.358
Old times.
Let's go, dog.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.735
All right, homie.

08:53.209 --> 08:55.113

09:05.069 --> 09:07.492
You know little Lexie, right?
Chuco's little brother...

09:07.760 --> 09:09.228
with the stuttering problem?

09:09.388 --> 09:10.479
Like that, right?

09:10.639 --> 09:14.090
This dud gets out two weeks ago,
and gets busted the same day!

09:14.350 --> 09:16.342
The stupid!
Not like us, homie.

09:16.717 --> 09:18.990
- Professionals right?
- No doubt.

09:19.397 --> 09:22.527
That's right, homes. When we're going
to work, man? What's up?

09:23.443 --> 09:25.935
I'm gonna give it at least two weeks
before I go back in.

09:26.276 --> 09:28.312
Hey, yo,
I should go inside or whatever.

09:29.228 --> 09:30.233
Damn.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.299
Who's this guy?

09:32.795 --> 09:34.527
He's helping me out,
letting me stay here.

09:35.497 --> 09:37.905
- This is his new lover, guys.
- Everything all right?

09:40.063 --> 09:41.725

These are my friends.

10:04.287 --> 10:05.489
The sandman?

10:06.027 --> 10:08.972

10:09.132 --> 10:12.064

10:12.747 --> 10:14.941

10:16.955 --> 10:20.658
You guys wanna come over Thursday night

Sounds great.
Thank you so much.

10:24.795 --> 10:26.254

Buddy Garrity, all right!

10:34.295 --> 10:35.445
Nice guys.

10:40.757 --> 10:41.757
Oh, honey.

10:42.039 --> 10:44.214
I just...
I looked at her little face

10:44.374 --> 10:46.557
and I could not...
I couldn't leave her there.

10:46.817 --> 10:48.734
We ran.
It was like we ran for our lives.

10:48.894 --> 10:49.908
I understand.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.396
It was like we were escaping
from prison, wasn't it?

10:52.940 --> 10:55.052
- She's our baby.
- She's our baby.

10:56.930 --> 10:59.403
Try again tomorrow.
There's no rush.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.489
Thank you for being so understanding.

11:02.039 --> 11:03.250
I have my moments.

11:03.503 --> 11:04.564
I know you do.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.219
Go to your daddy.

11:08.527 --> 11:10.360
Oh, not you again.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.606
I don't know
how I'm gonna bring myself

11:12.766 --> 11:15.241
to leave her with a bunch
of strangers tomorrow either.

11:15.401 --> 11:18.005
Not you again! What are you
doing here? Who are you?

11:18.286 --> 11:19.552
Where do you come from?

11:20.026 --> 11:21.622
Where do you come from?

11:31.253 --> 11:33.656
Beep beep, coming through.
Hi y'all.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.217
Sorry about that.
Good to see you.

11:36.377 --> 11:38.655
Hey, sweetie.
How's that calculus going?

11:40.788 --> 11:42.363
Nice. So you wimp out again?

11:42.842 --> 11:44.407
Honey, I did not wimp out.

11:44.762 --> 11:46.912
Don't call your mother a wimp.
It's demeaning.

11:47.072 --> 11:48.480
Gracie was not ready to go.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.821
When Gracie's ready to go,
Gracie will go.

11:51.090 --> 11:52.875
So you're just gonna
cart her around

11:53.035 --> 11:54.405
until she's married?

11:55.035 --> 11:55.751
No.

11:57.263 --> 11:59.088
- I'm not.
- All right.

11:59.348 --> 12:00.876
- Good luck, Gracie.
- Love you.

12:01.036 --> 12:03.314
- Have a very good day.
- Love you, mom. Bye.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.807
Carlota's leaving.
She's going back to Guatemala.

12:10.112 --> 12:11.781
The hot maid that you told me about?

12:11.941 --> 12:14.603
She's not a maid, she's a nurse!
She's in nursing school.

12:14.863 --> 12:16.170
She studies a lot.

12:17.107 --> 12:19.249
Yeah, that's her
and she's leaving.

12:19.521 --> 12:20.714
And she is hot.

12:24.723 --> 12:27.728
You're not sleeping
with the hot maid, are you?

12:28.128 --> 12:30.109
- Kinda.
- Are you serious?

12:31.098 --> 12:32.375
It's kinda cool.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.591
I don't...

12:36.985 --> 12:39.152
I'm speechless.
I don't even know what to say.

12:39.312 --> 12:41.297
You don't need to say anything,
it's fine.

12:41.557 --> 12:43.748
- I'm... I'm proud.
- Thanks.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.551
Now she's going back to Guatemala.

12:47.938 --> 12:51.002
- Why is she...
- She's got family stuff going on there.

12:51.162 --> 12:53.199
And there's nothing I can do.
I'm in high school,

12:53.359 --> 12:55.571
I can't... do that.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.018
You haven't developed feelings
or anything for her?

12:58.178 --> 12:59.428
I had develop feelings,

12:59.588 --> 13:01.475
- serious feelings.
- So do you love her?

13:02.214 --> 13:03.265
I think so.

13:03.787 --> 13:05.446
Don't go there, all right?

13:05.706 --> 13:08.317
Whether I love her or not,
she's leaving. It doesn't matter.

13:08.477 --> 13:10.874
She's going back to Guatemala
and now I'm stuck.

13:11.849 --> 13:13.107
This is Lyla Garrity

13:13.267 --> 13:15.864
and you're listening to
<i>I was a Teenage Christian</i>.

13:18.302 --> 13:19.691
<i>Am I on the air?</i>

13:19.851 --> 13:21.212
Yeah, you're on the air.

13:21.472 --> 13:23.005
<i>Oh, my God, I'm on the air!</i>

13:24.932 --> 13:28.389
Um, this is... Tina
and I'm from Waco.

13:29.816 --> 13:30.805
Why Waco?

13:31.440 --> 13:32.782
<i>And, I'm kind of</i>

13:33.224 --> 13:35.139
embarrassed saying this, but...

13:35.506 --> 13:37.603
I mean, I think Jesus was hot.

13:38.064 --> 13:39.011
<i>So hot.</i>

13:39.171 --> 13:41.065
He kind of looks like a movie star.

13:43.049 --> 13:45.194
Okay, the image
that you have in your head

13:45.454 --> 13:47.526
of what Christ looks like
probably has very little

13:47.686 --> 13:50.533
to do with reality.
That image has been generated

13:50.793 --> 13:52.665
<i>by hundreds of years of artists...</i>

13:52.825 --> 13:56.080
- What is going on out here?
- <i>... being italian, so there really</i>

13:56.459 --> 13:58.853
is no say as to what
he actually looks like.

13:59.013 --> 14:00.149
Is that Lyla?

14:03.263 --> 14:04.214
<i>One more.</i>

14:04.926 --> 14:07.883
What's the deal
with the shroud of Turin?

14:08.143 --> 14:09.218
<i>What's up with that?</i>

14:10.235 --> 14:12.254
Again, no one really knows

14:14.284 --> 14:16.851
- whether or not that's true, so...
- So,

14:17.145 --> 14:20.201
Someone just painted
his face on a sheet?

14:21.399 --> 14:24.069
Listen, I know you think
this is funny but it's not, it's rude.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.482
And there's real people
calling in with real questions,

14:26.642 --> 14:28.237
so I'm gonna disconnect now.

14:28.963 --> 14:31.536
Yes, and we're moving on to Karen.

14:32.251 --> 14:33.611
That was a success.

14:34.297 --> 14:36.316
Is your way of telling her you like her?

14:50.543 --> 14:52.386
Garrity, what's going on?

14:54.168 --> 14:55.553
What's your problem?

14:55.872 --> 14:58.017
I know that was you
calling in to the radio show,

14:58.358 --> 15:00.293
trying to make me look like an idiot.

15:00.715 --> 15:02.312
Why would you do that to me?

15:03.907 --> 15:05.898
I... thought it was funny.

15:06.884 --> 15:09.670
- To be honest with you.
- You thought it was funny?

15:10.074 --> 15:11.839
Do you ever think
about what you're doing?

15:11.999 --> 15:13.661
About who you might be hurting?

15:15.283 --> 15:17.940
I am doing that show,
getting up at 4:00 in the morning

15:18.100 --> 15:19.308
and after school,

15:19.586 --> 15:22.694
trying to help people who might not
have anyone else to turn to.

15:22.975 --> 15:25.389
Does that sound like something
you want to screw with?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.921
Then don't mess with me
on the air, please.

15:31.757 --> 15:32.718
Maybe...

15:32.978 --> 15:35.054
think about why you do things you do.

15:41.979 --> 15:42.979
Good night.

15:59.963 --> 16:01.121
You're lucky we came.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.502
How you doing?

16:11.391 --> 16:12.382
Thank you.

16:12.813 --> 16:14.734
We got that recipe
on our trip to Spain.

16:14.894 --> 16:17.596
- I'll show you how to make it.
- I'd love that.

16:18.024 --> 16:19.473
Can we go play with the Wii?

16:19.733 --> 16:21.559
- Of course.
- Y'all got a Wii?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.435
- Oh, I'm coming...
- Smash!

16:24.086 --> 16:25.980
I'm kidding.
I'm just playing.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.121
Sheila, you wanna come play too?

16:28.405 --> 16:30.658
You know you want
to play with the Wii, girl.

16:33.002 --> 16:34.251
Hey, I got winner.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.415
Take turns, amy.

16:40.663 --> 16:41.954
Well, uh, Corrina.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.339
Now that it's just us here,

16:44.856 --> 16:47.084
- could I ask you a question?
- Sure.

16:48.113 --> 16:50.202
How do you feel
about Smash and Noelle?

16:56.164 --> 16:58.932
I may be wrong,
but I don't think I am.

16:59.289 --> 17:00.556
This relationship...

17:02.726 --> 17:04.031
it just scares me.

17:04.612 --> 17:05.728
It scares you?

17:06.101 --> 17:07.271
Yeah, it scares me.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.960
Your son is a fine young man, Corrina.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.694
But you know we live
in Dillon, Texas,

17:14.040 --> 17:17.002
and you know that Dillon, Texas
has its ways, right?

17:17.877 --> 17:19.782
And I don't think that we want to have

17:20.042 --> 17:22.461
anyone wondering and worrying
about what's going on here,

17:22.880 --> 17:24.163
I think that...

17:24.501 --> 17:26.914
Well, no one else is gonna be
so open-minded about it.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.544
With all due respect,
the world has changed.

17:30.951 --> 17:32.588
I wish that were true, Smash.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.337
I have to admit

17:34.910 --> 17:38.093
I would feel a lot more comfortable
if you and Noelle,

17:39.203 --> 17:40.236
stop dating.

17:41.481 --> 17:43.466
I'm sorry.
That's how I feel.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.686
I have to say I agree.

17:56.956 --> 17:59.113
Righ here, see what I'm talking about?

17:59.375 --> 18:01.940
You got the three receivers set
when they go into tlat.

18:02.738 --> 18:04.828
You know, I saw Tami
and the baby ain today.

18:05.726 --> 18:07.204
Yeah, I know.
It's day three.

18:07.364 --> 18:10.084
Every time they pass
they end up moving around to the rig.

18:10.503 --> 18:12.776
Sometimes I wish Tami'd
just stay home,

18:13.056 --> 18:15.172
raise Gracie,
and quit the damn job.

18:15.902 --> 18:17.383
Hell if I'm gonna say that to her.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.594
You can get rid of that
if you just force 'em to go left there.

18:21.069 --> 18:23.222
You got a right
to your opinion, you know?

18:23.482 --> 18:25.888
I'm not so sure I do.
I'm not gonna ask her to do something

18:26.048 --> 18:27.685
that I woun't be able to do myself.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.712
That's 'cause you're
not supposed to.

18:29.872 --> 18:32.314
That's 'cause men aren't built that way.
But women are.

18:32.883 --> 18:35.629
They're supposed to want
to stay home with the kids.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.989
What the hell am I supposed to do?

18:40.249 --> 18:42.243
Shs got a career.
She loves her work.

18:42.837 --> 18:44.994
She has spent 16 years at home
with the first kid.

18:45.557 --> 18:48.157
I'm just saying that I wouldn't let
a woman of mine go to work

18:48.317 --> 18:49.790
if she had a kid at home.

18:50.050 --> 18:53.127
That sounds really stupid and ignorant
when you say that out loud.

18:53.476 --> 18:56.198
Well, sometimes the truth
is stupid and ignorant.

18:57.076 --> 18:59.632
Then I gave up cheerleading
last June.

18:59.894 --> 19:03.171
After everything I'd been through
it was kind of ridiculous

19:03.439 --> 19:06.582
to be cheering in a little skirt
for a guy to throw a ball.

19:07.638 --> 19:09.642
I actually burned my uniform.

19:10.419 --> 19:13.201
- What?
- I was feeling a little dramatic.

19:14.646 --> 19:17.935
What were the sequence of events
that lead you from lighting up

19:18.095 --> 19:19.402
to join the church?

19:21.801 --> 19:22.934
I felt lost.

19:24.362 --> 19:27.586
You know my...
my whole life sort of blew up.

19:28.269 --> 19:31.614
In the previous six months,
my parents split up and...

19:33.126 --> 19:35.209
a few other things
that I won't get into.

19:35.693 --> 19:38.591
God was just the only source
of comfort at that time.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.645
That relationship
just grew and grew

19:43.164 --> 19:47.114
I think it's always out there,
you know, just waiting for us.

19:47.964 --> 19:49.025
Definitely.

19:49.516 --> 19:50.590
Definitely.

19:51.278 --> 19:54.677
You are an interesting girl,
Lyla Garrity.

19:55.169 --> 19:57.465
It's too bad you're so hard on the eyes.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.401
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

20:08.046 --> 20:10.090
If everybody in the whole world

20:10.525 --> 20:12.840
would just not look
at what's on the outside

20:13.071 --> 20:15.625
and don't judge people
by the way they look,

20:15.887 --> 20:18.920
but instead see into their hearts
and see their souls.

20:19.537 --> 20:22.987
If that's what we did,
the world would just a better place.

20:23.147 --> 20:24.717
That's the whole thing.

20:25.496 --> 20:28.418
You just have to have faith in people.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.384
Let me ask you a question.

20:35.510 --> 20:37.901
If you had a gold watch,

20:38.061 --> 20:41.038
an antique goldwatch
that your grandfather gave you,

20:41.565 --> 20:44.845
would you leave it in your house
with a bunch of thugs?

20:45.671 --> 20:47.315
I don't believe I would.

20:49.777 --> 20:51.227
Chicken's good, hon.

20:51.682 --> 20:55.164
- Good job with the beans and the corn.
- Just go ahead and say it.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.046
Say what?

20:57.206 --> 21:00.378
You know, day three,
I didn't take in Gracie to the day care.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.746
I know you think I'm being weak
and over protective.

21:04.144 --> 21:06.401
I know. Just get it out.

21:09.288 --> 21:10.263
No, I don't.

21:10.525 --> 21:13.015
If you'd been there,
you wouldn't have been so brave either.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.561
I happened to have offered
to drop her off.

21:16.114 --> 21:18.848
- But that was not an option.
- You made me well aware of that.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.536
It wasn't an option.
You we absolutely not

21:21.696 --> 21:23.297
in the right mind for it.

21:23.654 --> 21:26.320
- Are you guys fighting?
- No, we're not. Eat your dinner.

21:27.761 --> 21:29.824
There are other options.

21:30.086 --> 21:31.701
Like what? What other options?

21:32.116 --> 21:34.820
- If you guys are gonna fight...
- Shut it!

21:34.980 --> 21:36.780
Just sit down and eat your dinner.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.001
Other options. There's lots of options.

21:39.416 --> 21:42.379
- Such as?
- One could be a leave of absence.

21:42.894 --> 21:45.508
- A leave of absence from my job.
- I'm not gonna get in a fight

21:45.668 --> 21:47.131
about this with you right now.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.693
You don't have to,
'cause you could sit there in judgment

21:49.853 --> 21:52.319
and you'll never
be threatened to have to leave your job

21:52.479 --> 21:54.211
which you love and have worked
so hard for

21:54.371 --> 21:57.872
to stay home and take care of the baby.
I hear what you're saying.

21:58.756 --> 22:01.689
- Can you pass the corn?
- Sure, honey. Here's the corn.

22:07.665 --> 22:09.197
- I got it!
- I'll get it.

22:11.358 --> 22:12.658
Or she can get it.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.849
- Hi, Buddy.
- Tami, how are you?

22:17.757 --> 22:18.881
- Come on in
- OK.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.985
Buddy's here. He's got a box.

22:22.204 --> 22:24.170
Oh, y'all are eating. Is it a bad time?

22:24.432 --> 22:26.087
No, it's fine. Come on in.

22:27.396 --> 22:29.240
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Good.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.824
Let me get another plate.

22:30.984 --> 22:33.250
- Whatcha got there?
- That's all right,

22:33.410 --> 22:37.269
- Make yourself comfortable.
- I just came by because I'm...

22:38.165 --> 22:40.394
I took all this stuff
out of the apartment.

22:40.656 --> 22:44.372
This is my prized possessions.
I got my Babe Ruth autographed baseball

22:44.532 --> 22:47.902
and my granddad's gold watch
and all this stuff.

22:48.164 --> 22:51.447
I came here 'cause you're great parents
and you always know what to.

22:51.822 --> 22:54.033
To tell you the truth
I don't know what to do

22:54.588 --> 22:57.067
'cause Santiago's friends
have resurfaced.

22:57.227 --> 23:00.228
His old friends, and they're like...
I don't want to be judgmental

23:00.388 --> 23:02.583
and I don't want to be prejudiced,

23:02.983 --> 23:04.915
but these guys are, like...

23:05.944 --> 23:07.835
They're thugs. And I don't know

23:07.995 --> 23:10.758
if I should leave this stuff
in the house 'cause I invited 'em over.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.269
It's his house too.
His friends should come over.

23:13.429 --> 23:15.767
If he sees me take all these out...

23:16.834 --> 23:19.721
So maybe I ought to just
put 'em back in there.

23:38.833 --> 23:42.013
OK, you know what?
I'm getting real sick of this.

23:42.691 --> 23:44.375
Sorry I don't feel like talking to you.

23:44.637 --> 23:47.109
You're gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

23:50.704 --> 23:51.704
Mom,

23:53.312 --> 23:55.841
What you and Noelle's parents
did at that dinner

23:56.001 --> 23:59.432
was completely stupid,
and humiliating.

23:59.694 --> 24:00.696
Stupid?

24:01.660 --> 24:03.978
Well, excuse me,
but I have a right to my own opinion.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.605
- Not when it's messing with my life.
- You don't get it.

24:06.867 --> 24:09.132
Maybe you're the one
that doesn't get it.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.251
What are you doing?

24:28.266 --> 24:31.047
I'm getting ready.
I'm going to a quincenera.

24:31.713 --> 24:33.070
You look beautiful.

24:33.925 --> 24:34.939
Thank you.

24:37.486 --> 24:40.381
- What is a quincenera?
- It's...

24:40.952 --> 24:43.665
It's a birthday party
for a 15-year-old girl,

24:44.614 --> 24:45.811
like sweet 16.

24:47.347 --> 24:49.523
The whole family goes. It's fun.

24:50.339 --> 24:51.412
All right.

24:53.704 --> 24:55.237
Well, have fun then.

24:59.378 --> 25:01.369
- Why don't you come with me?
- Yeah?

25:02.378 --> 25:03.286
Yeah.

25:04.938 --> 25:05.938
Let me...

25:06.546 --> 25:08.129
Let me just go change.

25:13.656 --> 25:15.017
Who are all they?

25:15.177 --> 25:17.468
It's her family

25:17.730 --> 25:19.095
They're supporting her.

25:19.993 --> 25:22.431
Wanna dance? Come on!

25:22.693 --> 25:24.653
- It's a waltz.
- All right, but...

25:24.813 --> 25:26.477
Okay. So,

25:26.739 --> 25:28.312
Put your hand my back like this.

25:28.574 --> 25:30.017
So I can rest my hand.

25:30.177 --> 25:31.619
It's like an arm rest.

25:31.779 --> 25:33.764
One, two, three. One, two, three.

26:00.138 --> 26:01.679
I don't want you to leave.

26:05.338 --> 26:06.792
I love you and...

26:07.546 --> 26:08.894
you love me

26:09.156 --> 26:11.141
so I don't understand
why you'd be leaving.

26:11.301 --> 26:13.774
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I can't stay, Matt.

26:14.036 --> 26:15.252
I know, I know.

26:15.915 --> 26:17.004
This...

26:17.356 --> 26:19.408
I know it sounds dumb
'cause I'm only 17.

26:19.568 --> 26:20.984
No, it's not that.

26:23.022 --> 26:25.244
I wish what you said was possible.

26:26.284 --> 26:27.418
My family...

26:28.281 --> 26:29.731
My family needs me.

26:31.274 --> 26:33.033
I have to be there for them.

26:33.931 --> 26:34.943
I'm sorry.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.614
Brian, the movie starts in 20 minutes.

27:01.876 --> 27:03.947
There's gonna be
a half hour of previews.

27:04.107 --> 27:07.960
All right, y'all enjoy the movie.
And come home right afterwards.

27:08.678 --> 27:10.275
- Thank you.
- There you go.

27:10.435 --> 27:13.375
thank you for taking your little sister
to the movies.

27:13.535 --> 27:14.668
You're welcome.

27:18.709 --> 27:19.882
Boy, boy, boy.

27:45.877 --> 27:47.267
Looks good, huh?

27:49.828 --> 27:52.373
Maybe I should go get some stuff
for when they come over.

27:52.635 --> 27:54.124
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

27:54.390 --> 27:57.503
Here, let me give you some money.
Get whatever you need,

27:57.765 --> 27:59.590
- Thank you.
- You bet.

28:15.481 --> 28:17.031
- Here.
- Thank you.

28:19.494 --> 28:20.494
Cheers...

28:31.360 --> 28:32.360
Let's talk.

28:45.032 --> 28:46.428
I think I forgot...

28:46.984 --> 28:48.388
I think I forgot...

28:49.133 --> 28:51.280
what this new motherhood...

28:52.832 --> 28:54.182
does to your life.

28:54.342 --> 28:56.855
How much it just turns
everything upside down.

28:57.294 --> 28:59.641
And I really thought
to be able to do it, you know?

28:59.801 --> 29:01.566
I could do the job
and I could...

29:01.726 --> 29:06.021
raise Gracie and take care of you
and take care of Jules and...

29:11.840 --> 29:14.905
But I don't think...
I don't think I can do it, you know?

29:15.065 --> 29:17.726
I do think I'm gonna have
to let the job go.

29:22.176 --> 29:24.536
I've to tell y'all...
something.

29:24.696 --> 29:27.676
You're not gonna quit your job,
so get all that out of your head.

29:29.197 --> 29:32.676
One of the reasons that you and I
gave up that job down at TMU

29:32.836 --> 29:34.767
is so that you didn't have
to give up your job.

29:35.727 --> 29:37.937
You're a damn good mother,
a damn good counselor.

29:38.198 --> 29:39.689
And you're a hell of a hot wife.

29:41.075 --> 29:43.718
I was just inside on the computer.
You know what I found out?

29:44.539 --> 29:47.280
I found out that separation
anxiety is completely normal.

29:48.032 --> 29:49.185
We get over it.

29:49.345 --> 29:52.095
I also found out
that certain studies suggest

29:52.304 --> 29:55.663
that children who go to daycare,
actually, it helps them socialize.

29:55.956 --> 29:58.973
If, in years to come,
it turns out the daycare screwed her up,

29:59.133 --> 30:00.668
she's always got you for counseling.

30:02.768 --> 30:03.873
You're funny.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.353
Stick together.
It all works out.

30:08.982 --> 30:10.127
C'me here.

30:16.888 --> 30:18.132
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:18.292 --> 30:20.034
Why we come all the way
to this theater?

30:20.194 --> 30:21.648
Two popcorns,
three drinks.

30:23.304 --> 30:24.454
Three drinks?

30:25.123 --> 30:26.123
Why...

30:27.075 --> 30:28.075
Smash, hey.

30:28.377 --> 30:29.377
Hey.

30:30.638 --> 30:33.159
- What did you tell your parents?
- Late practice. You?

30:33.419 --> 30:35.874
- That's my little excuse right here.
- Hey, Noannie.

30:36.034 --> 30:37.034
Hi.

30:37.630 --> 30:38.754
There you go.

30:39.062 --> 30:40.136
Thank you.

30:41.087 --> 30:43.237
Maybe we should go find our seats.

31:30.226 --> 31:32.968
Back up! Back it up!
Back up, homie, all right!

31:35.897 --> 31:38.015
Everybody, drink!
Have fun!

31:59.849 --> 32:01.099
Hey, little mama.

32:02.102 --> 32:03.924
What you're doing here
all by yourself?

32:04.572 --> 32:06.427
My brother's
right over there.

32:12.154 --> 32:13.304
Knock it off.

32:21.130 --> 32:23.420
Black on white
actually run in the family?

32:23.580 --> 32:26.396
'cause if it does,
I could help you out with that.

32:26.845 --> 32:27.645
Jerk.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.785
All right, hold this up, baby.

32:38.741 --> 32:39.869
I said knock it off.

32:41.410 --> 32:43.706
- I'm not doing anything.
- You leave my sister alone.

32:43.966 --> 32:46.062
You're the one
that left your sister alone.

32:46.657 --> 32:50.295
Besides, you got one of ours.
Why shouldn't we get one of yours?

32:56.437 --> 32:59.054
Come on, get up! Get up!
Come on, come on, go!

32:59.939 --> 33:00.806
He hit me!

33:02.360 --> 33:04.033
I didn't do anything to him!

33:10.451 --> 33:12.722
You okay, you okay?
You all right?

33:12.882 --> 33:15.113
Okay, just go right home
and I'll call you, okay?

33:15.373 --> 33:16.822
Come on, let's go.

33:42.441 --> 33:44.601
- Give me the watch back, Devon.
- What watch?

33:44.872 --> 33:46.644
No, don't play stupid with me, Devon!

33:47.074 --> 33:49.396
I know you got that watch
in that house, homie.

33:49.556 --> 33:50.940
I don't got no watch, man.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.882
Don't be an ass.
Give me the watch back!

33:53.042 --> 33:55.132
Oh, I'm being an ass?
Okay, okay.

33:55.292 --> 33:57.571
I'm not the one
who's sucking up to some bastard

33:57.833 --> 33:59.365
who's paying my way for everything.

33:59.625 --> 34:00.843
He's just helping...

34:01.003 --> 34:02.744
When did you forget
where you came from?

34:03.060 --> 34:05.633
He's helping you out?
Good, congratulations!

34:05.793 --> 34:07.332
Your fat fairy godmother showed up.

34:07.593 --> 34:08.583
Hooray!

34:09.429 --> 34:11.668
Sandman.
Football star.

34:12.994 --> 34:14.670
It's not my fault
I got a break, Devon.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.717
All right? It's supposed to be my fault
'cause I got a chance?

34:18.085 --> 34:19.259
Screw you.

34:21.733 --> 34:24.096
Do you think that guy
would give a damn about you

34:24.255 --> 34:26.100
if you weren't playing football
for his team?

34:31.063 --> 34:32.940
- I don't know.
- He doesn't care about you.

34:33.202 --> 34:36.110
He just wants something from you
and as soon as he gets it, he's gone.

34:36.384 --> 34:38.534
Now get the hell out my hood, man.

34:45.589 --> 34:47.165
Not without that watch.

35:22.817 --> 35:23.615
I'm sorry.

35:23.877 --> 35:25.868
- You shouldn't have even left me.
- I know.

35:26.129 --> 35:28.536
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
Look, look...

35:29.068 --> 35:30.966
- Just don't tell mom.
- What? No!

35:31.126 --> 35:33.334
Please, please, for me.
Don't tell mom.

35:34.683 --> 35:36.650
You shouldn't have left me!

35:38.824 --> 35:40.726
You shouldn't have left me!

35:48.176 --> 35:50.351
You are on the air with Lyla Garrity.

35:50.611 --> 35:51.978
<i>This is Rita from Larribee.</i>

35:52.238 --> 35:54.702
<i>When I pray at school
and I'm not bothering anyone else,</i>

35:54.862 --> 35:57.042
<i>I just bow my head
and put my hands together.</i>

35:57.202 --> 35:58.441
<i>People make fun of me,</i>

35:58.703 --> 36:00.485
<i>and it's really hard.
Makes me feel stupid</i>

36:00.747 --> 36:03.155
<i>and I don't want to.
What should I do?</i>

36:04.400 --> 36:05.949
<i>People are gonna make fun at school</i>

36:06.211 --> 36:08.452
for whatever
they can get their hands on.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.971
<i>But most importantly,</i>

36:12.063 --> 36:13.833
you gotta be true to who you are.

36:15.118 --> 36:16.568
<i>There's a gospel son,</i>

36:17.264 --> 36:19.380
"This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine."

36:19.930 --> 36:22.216
<i>And it doesn't just pertain
to spreading the word.</i>

36:22.476 --> 36:23.718
It pertains to you.

36:23.997 --> 36:26.595
<i>To the truth that lives inside you.</i>

36:27.242 --> 36:28.890
Don't hide that from the world.

36:29.597 --> 36:31.600
<i>Tell the world how you feel.</i>

36:32.375 --> 36:33.770
Let your light shine.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.441
<i>Thanks for calling in, Rita.
We're going to James.</i>

36:41.286 --> 36:42.566
Damn it, Lyla.

37:12.134 --> 37:14.227
- How are you doin'?
- Who are they for?

37:16.634 --> 37:17.437
A girl.

37:34.491 --> 37:35.349
Hello?

38:00.750 --> 38:02.000
Matthew, honey?

38:07.128 --> 38:08.964
She had to leave a day early.

38:10.068 --> 38:12.242
She really wanted
to tell you goodbye.

38:15.569 --> 38:17.288
It's too bad.
She was...

38:17.578 --> 38:18.749
She was a nice girl.

38:19.173 --> 38:20.010
Yeah...

38:21.177 --> 38:22.527
Good night, honey.

38:43.149 --> 38:44.530
All right, well...

38:44.690 --> 38:47.194
Great job. I can't believe
how fast you picked that up.

38:47.669 --> 38:49.697
Yeah, well, I have
a really good teacher.

38:50.316 --> 38:51.316
Thank you.

39:05.163 --> 39:07.301
Put this on the right way before you.

39:08.539 --> 39:10.098
Okay, that's...

39:10.751 --> 39:12.214
Okay.
All right.

39:12.772 --> 39:15.305
- * blast.
- Yeah, me too.

39:25.306 --> 39:26.776
Should we be letting go now?

39:57.576 --> 39:59.140
All right, let me *wamk* you out.

40:19.171 --> 40:20.620
God Almighty!

40:21.454 --> 40:22.978
What happened to you, son?

40:27.062 --> 40:29.755
I had to...
I had to get back your watch.

40:36.727 --> 40:37.728
Come on.

40:38.591 --> 40:40.141
Let's go get you cleaned up.

40:40.449 --> 40:43.018
Come on, buddy.
You'll be all right.

40:44.266 --> 40:46.104
- How was the movie?
- Yeah, how was it?

40:46.701 --> 40:47.732
It was good.

40:50.008 --> 40:51.010
I liked it.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.701
Y'all didn't say nothing about it
when you came home.

40:53.861 --> 40:55.280
You sure are quiet this morning.

41:10.335 --> 41:12.464
- Hi, there.
- Hi, how are you?

41:12.726 --> 41:14.132
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

41:14.394 --> 41:16.676
- I think we're ready.
- Great, good.

41:16.937 --> 41:19.764
- Oh, this is my husband Eric.
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.

41:21.089 --> 41:22.948
Okay, so how's Gracie?

41:23.108 --> 41:24.768
She's great.

41:25.709 --> 41:28.314
- So you ready?
- Yeah, she's ready.

41:31.492 --> 41:32.765
Love you Gracie.

41:34.039 --> 41:35.820
We're gonna take good care of her.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.199
Yes, she's a cutie.
Hi, sweet heart.

41:40.034 --> 41:42.285
Yeah, she's gonna do great.

41:43.964 --> 41:46.539
Here... Here's her bag.
There's everything in there.

41:47.886 --> 41:49.042
See you later, kid.

41:49.863 --> 41:51.207
Bye.
You have a good day.

41:51.367 --> 41:52.367
Bye, honey.

41:53.472 --> 41:54.472
Love you.

41:54.851 --> 41:56.300
Oh, here's Mr. Noodles.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.272
Oh, we've got Mr. Noodles too.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.771
Okay, bye.

41:59.931 --> 42:01.181
Have a good one.

42:06.646 --> 42:08.911
She didn't even turn around
and look at me.

42:09.741 --> 42:11.614
I think she's totally over me.

42:14.410 --> 42:17.113
- You have to pull that up.
- I know how...

42:17.273 --> 42:18.523
Well, I didn't.
