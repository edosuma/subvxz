Oh, boy, this
movie sucks, Dan.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.382
I didn't make it, dear.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.783
Well, you rented it.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.684
Well, it's Saturday.

00:16.784 --> 00:17.851
Everybody's renting Saturday.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.320
There wasn't nothing left.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.322
Well, that's why you got to
get the Friday night people

00:21.422 --> 00:23.257
when they're coming back down.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.625
You wait till they
get out their cars,

00:24.725 --> 00:25.726
you check what
they're returning,

00:25.826 --> 00:28.229
and then you have
to stick with them.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.364
Bet there's something on TV.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.632
No, it's Sunday night.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.535
I don't want to
watch regular TV.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.370
You wanna go out
somewhere else?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.506
Too tired.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.308
I'm gonna just go to sleep.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.275
It's only 8:30.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.277
If we go to bed
now, we'll get up

00:43.377 --> 00:45.446
at, like, four in the morning.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.047
And we'll have
nothing to do again.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.221
When did we pass away, Dan?

00:53.321 --> 00:54.588
I can't believe you, Mark.

00:54.688 --> 00:55.956
I don't even know
what your problem is.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.258
Well maybe that's the problem.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.992
Just forget it.

00:59.093 --> 01:02.130
Don't you slam
that door on me.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.933
Hey, finally,
something worth watching.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.136
You take me to a party
where I don't know anybody,

01:08.236 --> 01:10.003
and you just ditch
me for your friends?

01:10.104 --> 01:10.971
Andy got a new car.

01:11.071 --> 01:11.972
We went for a ride.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.107
Well, as long as
you're having fun,

01:13.207 --> 01:15.109
then that's all
that counts, right?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.645
What was I supposed to do, Mark?
- Do what you always do.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.780
You sit in a corner and
you whine about my friends.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.815
Oh, you don't care
about me at all.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.351
Not this again.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.618
Yeah, well when
was the last time we

01:24.718 --> 01:27.121
did something I wanted to do?

01:27.221 --> 01:29.557
Well, you wanted to leave the
party, and we left the party.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.092
Well then why didn't you
just go back there, then, Mark?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.061
So you can be with your
friends, who are obviously more

01:34.162 --> 01:35.496
important to you than I am.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
That's garbage.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.499
Yeah, well, what
about Thanksgiving, huh?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.601
I went through a lot of trouble
to get you invited to dinner,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.836
and you just ran off to
Chicago with Andy and Rick.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.038
Well, I didn't exactly want
to hang out with your parents.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.241
Well, nobody wants to hang
out with my parents, Mark!

01:50.711 --> 01:53.013
You would have been
doing it for me.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.114
So, one time.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.015
All the time.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.953
It seems like we have the
same fight whenever we go out.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.889
When is this going to change?

02:01.989 --> 02:04.458
We're not going to talk about
our relationship again, are we?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.160
No, I don't think we have
a relationship anymore.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.495
Oh, and what's that
supposed to mean?

02:07.595 --> 02:10.164
It means I'm sick of it.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.167
I'm sick of fighting, I'm
sick of the way you treat me,

02:13.267 --> 02:14.568
I'm sick of you.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.441
Oh, I hate him.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.410
I hope he dies.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.511
Do you want to talk about it?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.479
Well, there's nothing
talk about anymore.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.315
It's over.

to dump this guy now.

you through this.

even know why I care.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.486

07:32.586 --> 07:34.187
But just because
you broke up with him

07:34.287 --> 07:36.824
doesn't mean that you
don't still love him.

with this, Jackie?

you love him doesn't

Why would we want to be alone?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.350
I-- I don't know
the answer to that.

09:47.120 --> 09:47.988
I heard you out here.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.158
I figured you might
want this back.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.993
Fine.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.095
Well, I got to get
back to work, so.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.600
Well.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.302
I guess it takes a big
man to return an earring.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.607
He's still working here?

10:07.708 --> 10:09.042
Um, yes?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.377
You're kidding.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.680
You're letting him work here
after the way he treated me?

10:12.780 --> 10:14.915
Well, Becky, you can't
expect me to fire him

10:15.015 --> 10:16.283
just because you two broke up.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.317
Well, yes, I do!

10:17.417 --> 10:18.218
Well, I can't.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.152
Why not?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.453
You only hired
him because of me!

10:20.553 --> 10:22.155
No, no, I gave him
a shot because of you.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.225
I hired him because
he's a good mechanic.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.326
So you don't care how I feel.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.029
Well of course I do.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.230
He was horrible to me.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.700
Becky, this is business.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.267
The kid's earned the
right to work here.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.671
I'm not going to fire him.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.774
Well, I guess we can
see whose side you're on.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.675
Thanks, dad.

10:55.989 --> 10:56.790
So, am I fired?

10:56.890 --> 10:58.391
No, no, no, no.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.728
I need a mechanic.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.262
But I can't have her
mad at me all the time.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.396
I gotta find
something that's going

11:03.496 --> 11:06.333
to make her happy and me happy.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.001
Hey, you mind if I smack
you around a little bit?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.847
[music playing]

11:28.021 --> 11:28.922
New guy tonight, huh?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.457
Yep.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.260
What's his problem?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.328
There is no problem.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.598
Dean happens to be a really
great guy, and the kind of guy

11:38.698 --> 11:41.401
who doesn't make me wait
for him, the kind of guy

11:41.501 --> 11:44.671
who asked me what I want to do.

11:44.772 --> 11:49.376
Well, maybe you can train
him to treat you like crap.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.244
When are you
going to run away?

11:51.344 --> 11:52.245
So, you hate Mark now?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.681
No, I'm just glad it's over.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.884
Are you going to
have sex with Dean?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.218
Oh, of course, Darlene.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.620
I wanna have sex with every
guy I meet from now on.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.323
And Dean's OK with this?

12:03.423 --> 12:04.792
Shut up.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.027
All I meant was that
you slept with Mark.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.162
So?

12:09.262 --> 12:12.199
Well-- are you sorry you did?

12:12.299 --> 12:13.500
No.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.602
I really did love him.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.505
I just wish he'd turned
out to be halfway human.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.473
Yeah, I'm going
to miss the guy.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.109
Oh, please.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.210
No, I'm serious!

12:23.310 --> 12:24.544
I mean, even when I
was really depressed,

12:24.644 --> 12:28.215
I could always
laugh at old stupid.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.851
Well, just do me a favor
and leave Dean alone.

12:30.951 --> 12:31.751
All right.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.257
Wait a minute.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.326
I mean, if I go down there,
and this Dean guy's got,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.461
like, some sweltering
zit on his forehead--

12:41.561 --> 12:42.996
Oh, jeez.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.798
Well, what, am I just
supposed to let that go?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.269
See, I dislocated my
shoulder in practice,

12:49.369 --> 12:51.304
but there was no way I was
going to miss that last game.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.339
So I didn't tell anybody.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.706
Must have been killing you.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.842
If you can't
play with the pain,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.143
you may as well be
on the tennis team.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.044
Tell me about it.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.979
Listen to this knee.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.280
[popping sound]

13:00.380 --> 13:02.415
Man, that thing really pops.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.884
I did it in JV.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.185
There's no cartilage
in here, son.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.621
That's bone on bone.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.058
Cool.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.125
Here's some more chips.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.293
Hey, Rosie.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.928
Dean hurt himself in
football, just like I did.

13:15.028 --> 13:15.996
Really?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.564
You got drunk and
fell off the bus, too?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.069
I hurt it in a game.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.704
The bus thing just
aggravated it.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.973
Hey, Dean.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.107
Hey.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.675
Hey, you look fantastic.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.576
Thanks.

13:29.676 --> 13:30.710
I guess you met everybody.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.712
This is my sister, Darlene.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.613
Hi.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.386
Nothing.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.287
Well, let's go.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.188
OK.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.222
Here, let me get your coat.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.756
He's helping her
on with her coat.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.626
This guy is so great, Roseanne!

13:46.726 --> 13:48.428
It was, uh-- it was
nice to meet you all.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.963
Well, be home by 11:00.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.098
Or 12:00!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.970
Oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god, he's incredible!

13:57.070 --> 13:57.871
I love him!

13:57.971 --> 14:00.974
I want to date him myself!

14:01.074 --> 14:04.411
Isn't he perfect, Roseanne?

14:04.511 --> 14:06.146
He's history, Dan.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.780
What are you talking about?

14:07.881 --> 14:09.049
She thought he was great.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.283
I mean, it was so obvious.

14:10.383 --> 14:14.221
He's what's known
as the transition guy.

14:14.321 --> 14:18.725
Dead before he pulled
into the driveway, Dan.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.661
Better off forgetting
all about Dustin.

14:21.761 --> 14:22.562
Dave.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.764
Whatever.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.234
He's the poor slob who's stuck
in between first boyfriend

14:27.334 --> 14:28.535
and the next boyfriend.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.436
No, no.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.404
No, no, no.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.806
It doesn't have
to work like that.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.076
I mean, Roseanne, you
never had a transition guy.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.510
What do you
think you are, Dan?

14:41.581 --> 14:43.483
Isn't he coming back?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.519
I'll explain it
to you someday.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.654
But I liked him!

14:47.754 --> 14:49.856
He didn't call me jerkweed!

14:49.957 --> 14:53.726
Well, he didn't know you, DJ.

14:53.826 --> 14:54.861
I don't believe this.

14:54.962 --> 15:00.833
Well, there'll be lots
of other boys, honey.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.169
Nice boys.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.238
Won't be nicer than Dean.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.142
Well, you'll just love
them in a different way, Dan.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.844
So you knew this guy was
dead from the beginning?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.413
Yeah, why do you
think I tried to unload

15:13.513 --> 15:16.716
the salt-free chips on him?

15:16.816 --> 15:19.419
Well, in the future, would
you please give me a clue

15:19.519 --> 15:23.223
before I let some strange
guy listen to my knee?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.791
Here's the way it works, Dan.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.494
The next guy you
hate, he's the keeper.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.196
Never a poker game.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.363
That's good, Dan.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.800
Get yourself out there,
get on with your life.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.769
Well, at least
I'll know what to do

15:36.869 --> 15:39.439
when this happens with Darlene.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.609
Look how cute you are!

15:42.709 --> 15:45.545
I hate this.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.713
Poor guy.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.781
He didn't have a clue.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.883
Yeah, it's like somebody
moved his food dish.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.789
Well, I guess we
better get going.

15:56.889 --> 15:57.690
Yeah.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.992
What are we doing tonight?

15:59.092 --> 16:02.229
Well, it was Crystal's
pick, so she's got us going

16:02.329 --> 16:04.197
to some self-help seminar.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.599
Oh, no.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.135
Well, you know how
Crystal is lately.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.471
She's a basket case,
so she needs to network

16:11.571 --> 16:13.040
with other basket cases.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.975
Yeah, but what are
we supposed to do?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.844
Well, we'll just sit
up there in the back

16:17.944 --> 16:20.547
and make fun of everybody.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.415
OK.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.816
How's your back?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.218
Mm, pretty good.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.853
You going to physical therapy?

16:26.953 --> 16:28.321
Yeah, twice a week.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.023
And I'm sticking to my diet.

16:30.123 --> 16:30.923
I'm doing all right.

16:31.024 --> 16:31.824
Yeah?

16:31.924 --> 16:34.461
What about your exercise?

16:34.561 --> 16:36.329
What about your love life?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.764
[doorbell]

16:37.864 --> 16:40.233
I'll get it.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.134
Hey.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.935
Hi, Mark.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.304
Can you tell Becky I'm here?

16:44.404 --> 16:47.474
Um, Becky isn't
home right now, Mark.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.609
Her car is out front.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.977
She's not home.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.446
Is she out with that Dean guy?

16:53.546 --> 16:56.616
Well, I don't know if that's
any of your business, Mark.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.651
I'm going to be
in the kitchen.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.553
Well, have you been
telling her that I called?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.655
Yes, Mark.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.257
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.126
What are you,
calling me a liar?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.027
Hey, I got a husband and a boss.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.496
I have no need to lie to you.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.902
So why didn't she
called me back, then?

17:16.002 --> 17:18.338
Well, maybe she doesn't
want to call you, back, Mark.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.641
Maybe when she said it was
over, it really was over.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.376
And like you didn't have
anything to do with that,

17:23.476 --> 17:24.311
either.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.378
Like you don't run
her whole life.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.280
Oh, you think
she listens to me?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.116
Come on, you've had it
in for me since day one.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.484
Always putting me down,
calling me a jerk.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.919
Yeah, and the more
names I called you,

17:33.019 --> 17:35.722
the more money I had to shell
out for birth control pills.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.557
You won't admit it, will you?

17:37.657 --> 17:38.658
You're the reason we broke up.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.827
If once you'd treated me
decent, me and Becky--

17:40.927 --> 17:41.794
Hey!

17:41.894 --> 17:42.929
I would have treated
you like a king

17:43.029 --> 17:44.897
if you would have shown
my daughter any respect.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.334
If you just once had thought
about her before you thought

17:47.434 --> 17:48.668
about yourself,
well, you wouldn't

17:48.768 --> 17:50.603
need to be here right now
trying to blame this whole thing

17:50.703 --> 17:51.804
on me, would you, Mark?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.773
Now, quit wasting my time
and get out of my house.

17:53.873 --> 17:54.674
Fine.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.512
Whoa.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.415
You really nuked him.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.251
I don't know, Jackie.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.219
Gee, I've been
dreaming about laying

18:06.319 --> 18:08.821
into that punk for a year
and a half, you know?

18:08.921 --> 18:12.992
I finally get the chance, and I
forgot to make fun of his hair.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.395
[music playing]

18:22.802 --> 18:24.604
Oh, Dad, I wish
you would respect

18:24.704 --> 18:26.973
the fact that I don't eat meat.

18:27.073 --> 18:27.940
What are you talking about?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.509
This is pepperoni.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.444
It's meat, and I don't
think an animal should

18:31.544 --> 18:33.446
have to die just to feed us.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.715
Oh, come on, Darlene.

18:35.815 --> 18:39.186
This stuff's made out of the
hair, the teeth, and the tail.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.289
Nothing a little piggy
can't live without.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.190
Yeah?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.592
Uh, flowers for Becky Conner?

18:45.692 --> 18:46.559
OK, thanks.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.894
Becky!

18:47.994 --> 18:49.262
Who do you think
those are from?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.230
Who else?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.632
Dean, Dean, the
son-in-law machine.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.700
Hey Rosie, come on out here!

18:53.800 --> 18:54.601
Hurry up.

18:57.837 --> 18:58.971
Lookee here.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.874
Oh, Dan, you actually
remembered Valentine's Day?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.311
Yeah, just now.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.278
Awww!

19:05.378 --> 19:06.379
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.580
What you're going
to get me is going

19:07.680 --> 19:09.782
to be way better than that.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.251
I can't believe it.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.619
These are from Mark.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.520
No.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.088
It can't be.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.291
Yeah, listen to this.

19:18.391 --> 19:22.962
Dear Becky, thinking of
you first for a change.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.333
I love you, Mark.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.767
Too little, too
late, huh, Becky?

19:30.603 --> 19:32.439
I'm gonna go find
something to put these in.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.646
Man, this is all
your fault. You

19:39.746 --> 19:40.813
shouldn't have
called her down here

19:40.913 --> 19:43.316
till you changed that card.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.651
He wouldn't have
sent them flowers

19:44.751 --> 19:47.086
if you hadn't have given that
big speech about respect.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.288
Hey, if you would
have fired him,

19:48.388 --> 19:49.856
he wouldn't be able to
afford them damn flowers,

19:49.956 --> 19:52.058
now would he?

19:52.158 --> 19:56.028
All right, old
stupid's coming back!

19:56.128 --> 19:57.730
We don't know that.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.066
Dad, thanks for
not firing him.

20:00.166 --> 20:00.967
You were so right.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.104
And you thought he was a jerk.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.311
[music playing]

20:19.586 --> 20:20.387
Hi.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.621
Remember me?

20:21.721 --> 20:24.457
I-- I played Dean in
tonight's episode of Roseanne.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.993
Now, I don't know
about you, but I

20:27.093 --> 20:28.428
thought that Dean was
the kind of character

20:28.528 --> 20:31.531
that I'd like to see again.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.166
Mark, he's all wrong for Becky.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.636
And Dean can make her happy.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.004
And there's no reason
that Becky couldn't

20:38.104 --> 20:39.306
fall in love with Dean.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.040
They just have to
write it that way.

20:41.140 --> 20:46.946
So, if you feel like I
do, let's bring Dean back.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.048
You can make a difference.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.518
Just drop a card, or, or
make a phone call, or--

20:51.618 --> 20:52.619
WOMAN: Hey!

20:52.719 --> 20:54.487
Aren't you supposed
to be washing my car?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.856
Hey, keep your pants
on, I'm talking here.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.760
Uh-oh.

21:08.668 --> 21:12.839
