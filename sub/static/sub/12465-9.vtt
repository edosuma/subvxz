00:05.906 --> 00:08.374
THANK YOU
FOR DONATING.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.879
THANK YOU FOR...
DONATING.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.649
"UP-CYCLING" IS WHEN
YOU TAKE OLD CLOTHES,
ADD SOME BLING

00:17.651 --> 00:19.918
MAKE 'EM SING,
AND THEN YOU DONATE THEM
TO CHARITY.

00:19.920 --> 00:23.789
I ACTUALLY JUST MADE A BEACH BAG
OUT OF A COUPLE OF OLD SKIRTS.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.525
YEAH. I CALL IT THE...

00:26.527 --> 00:28.961
"TOTES CUTE TOTE."
( laughs )

00:28.963 --> 00:30.562
ANDIE! ANDIE, ANDIE,
ANDIE, ANDIE.

00:34.969 --> 00:38.971
LIV, WHAT DID WE SAY ABOUT
SNEAKING UP ON THE GIRL
WITH THE BLOWTORCH?

00:40.474 --> 00:43.842
MY BROTHER DID THAT ONCE.
HE STILL ONLY HAS ONE EYEBROW.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.780
WHOA!

00:47.782 --> 00:49.948
FLOWER PINS-- SCORE!

00:49.950 --> 00:51.350
RIGHT?
HA, HA!

00:51.352 --> 00:53.385
ANDIE AND I MET IN ART CLASS,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.954
AND WE ARE ALSO CO-CHAIRS
OF THE UP-CYCLING CLUB.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.973
I REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY LIKE HER,

00:57.974 --> 00:59.991
BUT WE ARE SORT OF FINDING
THAT WE ARE CUT FROM
A DIFFERENT CLOTH.

00:59.994 --> 01:03.562
I AM A SOFT VELVET,
WHERE SHE IS MORE OF A...

01:03.564 --> 01:04.797
( inhales sharply )

01:04.799 --> 01:06.732
BULLETPROOF KEVLAR.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.735
BEING THE ONLY GIRL
IN A HOUSE OF FIVE BROTHERS

01:09.737 --> 01:12.738
LEAVES SOME GAPS
IN YOUR GIRL SKILLS,

01:12.740 --> 01:16.275
SO HANGING WITH LIV IS
LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,

01:16.277 --> 01:18.243
WHICH, IN A HOUSE
WITH FIVE BROTHERS,

01:18.245 --> 01:20.879
IS ALSO SOMETHING
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.916
CHECK IT OUT. LIV.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.751
( gasps )

01:25.753 --> 01:27.453
THOSE ARE TRASH-TASTIC!

01:28.389 --> 01:29.922
- WAIT, WHERE'D YOU GET THE...
- ( metal clatters )

01:29.924 --> 01:31.356
- ...THE METAL?
- OH!

01:31.358 --> 01:33.492
FROM THE UP-CYCLING BIN.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.627
I FIGURE IF YOU CAN'T
UP-CYCLE THE UP-CYCLING BIN...

NOT NAP TIME.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.664
( yelps )

02:47.735 --> 02:49.434
OW, WHO'S AIR HOCKEY PUCK
IS THAT?

02:49.436 --> 02:51.637
SORRY, MUNCH.
THAT ONE GOT AWAY FROM ME.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.972
HITTING YOU WAS JUST
A NICE BONUS.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.440
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.576
PLAYING AIR HOCKEY
WITH MY BIG BROTHER.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.112
BUT I'M YOUR BIG BROTHER.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.415
I JOINED THIS NEW PROGRAM--
"SHOW UP TO BRO UP."

03:03.417 --> 03:05.017
I WANTED TO GET PAIRED UP
WITH AN OLDER GUY

03:05.019 --> 03:06.418
WHO COULD TEACH ME
COOL STUFF.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.355
BUT I'M AN OLDER GUY
WHO COULD TEACH YOU COOL STUFF.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.057
( laughing )

03:12.059 --> 03:13.458
OH, WAIT,
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.995
YO, LITTLE BRO,
WE STILL PLAYING?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.063
ONE SECOND,
BIG BRO.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.067
YOUR "BIG BRO" IS
TODD STETSON?

03:23.938 --> 03:25.637
WELL, WHAT DOES HE HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

03:25.639 --> 03:28.874
BESIDES HUGE PECS,
GIGANTIC BICEPS

03:28.876 --> 03:31.777
AND A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP
TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.045
OKAY, I TOTALLY SEE
YOUR POINT.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.448
I REMEMBER YOU.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.717
YOU HELPED ME WITH
MY GEOMETRY HOMEWORK.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.653
OH. HA.
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS
MOLLY MYMAN,

03:41.655 --> 03:44.056
BUT I CAN SEE HOW
YOU'D CONFUSE US.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.024
WE BOTH WEAR GLASSES...

03:46.026 --> 03:47.092
EXCEPT FOR MOLLY...

03:48.395 --> 03:50.062
WHO DOES NOT.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.798
TODD SAYS I'VE GOT SERIOUS
AIR HOCKEY SKILLS.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.399
OH, STRAIGHT UP, BRO!

03:56.971 --> 03:58.036
( both grunt )

03:59.506 --> 04:01.573
I LOVE HAVING
A COOL BIG BROTHER!

04:02.943 --> 04:05.177

YOU ALREADY HAVE
A COOL BIG BROTHER!

04:08.015 --> 04:09.081
( grunts )

04:13.587 --> 04:16.955
HEY, MOM, NEED A HAND?
I AM HERE TO HELP.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.757
ARE YOU ONE OF MY CHILDREN?

04:20.794 --> 04:21.994
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:21.996 --> 04:24.830
I AM GETTING
MY STEPS UP.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.698
NOW THAT I FINALLY
HAVE MY KNEE BRACE OFF,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.467
I'M TRYING TO BUILD UP
MY CARDIO.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.569
I EVEN GOT MYSELF THIS
HANDY, DANDY SAFARI STEPPER

04:30.571 --> 04:31.803
TO HELP ME KEEP TRACK
WITH MY STEPS.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.622
GOOD FOR YOU.

04:33.623 --> 04:35.440
HEY, THINK YOU'RE IN
AS GOOD SHAPE AS YOUR OLD MOM?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.009
CAN STILL DO THE SPLITS,
YOU KNOW?

04:37.011 --> 04:38.076
RUSSIAN AND CHINESE.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.212
NOBODY WANTS
TO SEE THAT, MOM.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.947
OH!

04:41.949 --> 04:44.616
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY
CAN'T HANDLE THE COMPETITION.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.987
COMPETITION?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.025
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT
WE... COMPETE?

04:53.027 --> 04:55.060
OOH!

04:55.061 --> 04:57.094
'CAUSE, UH, THESE THINGS
ARE SOLD IN PAIRS.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.866
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
A STEP OFF?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.068
MAMA CAN HANDLE IT.
YOU'RE ON.

05:05.239 --> 05:08.807
I WILL TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL
SO FAST, YOU'LL CALL ME
BUS DRIVER.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.809
BEEP, BEEP!

05:10.811 --> 05:14.212
PLEASE, YOU'LL BE
THE BABY ON THE BUS
GOING, "WAH, WAH, WAH!"

05:15.849 --> 05:17.916
NOW CHECK OUT
THESE SPLITS. OKAY.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.253
OKAY, IT'S JUST THAT
THE JEANS DON'T STRETCH.

05:21.255 --> 05:23.639
( chuckles )
SO...

05:23.640 --> 05:26.024
YOU ARE VERY LUCKY
THAT I AM NOT WEARING
MY YOGA PANTS RIGHT NOW.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.562
SYNCHRONIZE OUR STEPPERS,
STARTING...

05:30.564 --> 05:31.630
- NOW.
- OKAY. HMM.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.099
WAIT.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.834
MOM. MOM!

05:35.836 --> 05:37.869
MOM, WHERE'S MY TWIN CHARM
BRACELET?!

05:37.871 --> 05:40.939
WHEN LIV MOVED AWAY
TO LOS ANGELES, SHE GOT US
MATCHING TWIN CHARMS.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.009
AND EVERY DAY THAT
SHE WAS AWAY, IT HELPED
ME FEEL CONNECTED TO HER.

05:45.079 --> 05:48.547
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.148
SO, HAVE ANY
OF YOU GUYS SEEN IT?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.967
( chuckles nervously )

05:51.968 --> 05:53.785
NO, BUT I'M SERIOUS.
START LOOKING. THANK YOU.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.987
I LOST IT!
OH, LIV IS GONNA KILL ME!

05:55.989 --> 05:58.023
OKAY, OKAY,
JUST SIT DOWN.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.658
RELAX. WE ARE GONNA
FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU LOST IT.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.759
OKAY.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.794
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES...

06:02.796 --> 06:05.697
- AND TRY TO REMEMBER.
- ( gadget beeps )

06:12.606 --> 06:13.972
MOM, ARE YOU TRYING TO
GET YOUR STEPS UP?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.207
I SAID CLOSE YOUR EYES!

06:17.644 --> 06:20.245
HEY, ANDIE,
FINISH GOING THROUGH
ALL THE LOST AND FOUND?

06:20.247 --> 06:22.564
FIND ANYTHING GOOD
WE CAN UP-CYCLE?

06:22.565 --> 06:24.882
A LOT OF T-SHIRTS FROM
JOEY'S FAILED RUN FOR
CLASS PRESIDENT.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.951
AH.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.621
"KEEP CALM AND JOEY ON."

06:31.325 --> 06:33.291
I'M KINDA THINKING
PEOPLE LOST THESE ON PURPOSE.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.094

06:36.096 --> 06:37.629
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
MADDIE'S SWEATER.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.663

06:38.665 --> 06:39.898

06:43.737 --> 06:45.103
SHE LOST THESE?!

06:45.105 --> 06:46.171
( gasps )

06:46.173 --> 06:48.640
WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL ME?!

06:48.642 --> 06:49.708
DID SHE TELL YOU?!

06:50.811 --> 06:51.843
( gasps sharply )

06:51.845 --> 06:52.978

I GOT THESE FOR HER
WHEN I MOVED AWAY TO HOLLYWOOD,

07:04.291 --> 07:06.158
AND, YOU KNOW,

07:06.160 --> 07:07.693
KNOWING THAT SHE
WAS WEARING HERS

07:07.694 --> 07:09.227
MADE IT EASIER FOR ME
TO BE SO FAR AWAY.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.998
AW, THAT'S SWEET.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.900
MY BROTHERS NEVER
GIVE ME CHARMS.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.301
THEY DID LET
A FRUIT BAT LOOSE
IN MY BEDROOM ONCE

07:16.303 --> 07:18.203
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.941

THEY LOVE ME IN
THEIR OWN SPECIAL WAY.

OKAY, I HAVE FOUND
MY RETAINER,

09:51.892 --> 09:55.927
LIV, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE UPSET...

09:55.929 --> 09:58.196
SORT OF LIKE YOU ARE NOW.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.031
WELL, I'M--
( sighs )

10:00.033 --> 10:04.035
NO, I'M NOT UPSET.
I'M JUST SO...

10:04.037 --> 10:05.370
SO DISAPPOINTED.

10:07.474 --> 10:10.542
OOH.
THE DISAPPOINTMENT CARD--

10:10.544 --> 10:13.078
A STRATEGY USUALLY
RESERVED FOR PARENTS,

10:13.080 --> 10:16.114
BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE
COMING FROM A TWIN.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.050
LIV USED
THE DISAPPOINTMENT CARD
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

10:19.052 --> 10:23.088
I'M NOT UPSET,
JUST SO...

10:23.090 --> 10:24.456
SO DISAPPOINTED.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.362
Joey:
<i>WHAT TIME IS IT?</i>

10:35.068 --> 10:37.102
IT'S JOUSTING TIME.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.040
I HAD TO FIND A WAY
TO SHOW PARKER

10:42.042 --> 10:45.276
THAT I WAS A BETTER BIG BROTHER
THAN TODD STETSON.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.479
PARKER LIKED HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS INTO SPORTS,

10:47.481 --> 10:49.481
WHICH ISN'T EXACTLY
IN MY WHEELHOUSE.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.484
SO, I PICKED
THE NEXT BEST THING--

10:52.486 --> 10:55.420
15th CENTURY
SPECTATOR SPORTS.

10:56.390 --> 10:57.956
HOW NOW, GOOD SIR?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.025
I HAVE TICKETS TO
TODAY'S JOUST.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.994
PRITHEE, WOULD YOU JOIN ME
AT THE RENAISSANCE FAIR?

11:04.398 --> 11:06.131
"PET NOT THIS CAT"?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.365
YEAH.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.334
I MADE MY OWN
FAMILY MOTTO AND CREST

11:09.336 --> 11:11.102
BASED ON MY LOVE
OF KITTIES.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.975
I'M IN, KIND SIR.
LET US MOUNT OUR STEEDS
AND BE OFF!

11:18.412 --> 11:21.079
DO I KNOW MY LITTLE BROTHER,
OR WHAT?

11:21.081 --> 11:24.449
HEY, TODD STETSON,
PET NOT THIS CAT.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.518
( meows, hisses )

11:27.954 --> 11:30.488
OH, PARKER, LOOK WHO I FOUND
WALKING UP THE DRIVEWAY.

11:30.490 --> 11:34.259
IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE
A BIG, STRONG BOY TO HELP ME
CARRY IN THE GROCERIES.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.096
BUT I'M A BIG, STRONG BOY
TO HELP YOU CARRY IN
THE GROCERIES.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.465
OH, YES YOU ARE.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.367
OH, MAMA LOVES YOU.
( giggles )

11:44.071 --> 11:46.171
HEY, LITTLE BRO,
THE AIR HOCKEY TABLE

11:46.173 --> 11:48.890
AT CLANCY'S IS
CALLING OUR NAME.

11:48.891 --> 11:51.608
SORRY, TODD,
HE ALREADY HAS PLANS
WITH HIS REAL BIG BROTHER.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.246
NO OFFENSE, MUNCH,
BUT AN AFTERNOON
OF AIR HOCKEY

11:55.248 --> 11:59.150
WITH TODD STETSON
TRUMPS AN AFTERNOON
OF DRESS-UP WITH YOU.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.124
WOW, THIS DRESS IS LEGIT.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.226
-  <i> YEAH.</i>
- GOOD CALL PUTTING
AN UP-CYCLING BIN

12:08.228 --> 12:10.261
IN FRANK'S MAKE-YOUR-OWN
MEAT PIE FACTORY.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.932
YEAH, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LEAVE
A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF CLOTHING
AT FRANK'S.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.468
I MEAN, WHO TAKES OFF
THEIR CLOTHES TO MAKE
A MEAT PIE?

12:16.470 --> 12:19.170
SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.538
IT TOTALLY
MAKES SENSE TO ME.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.476
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR SISTER
NECKLACE THINGY?

12:24.478 --> 12:26.044
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.179
( gasps )
IT'S GONE!

12:28.181 --> 12:29.514
MY SISTER NECKLACE THINGY
IS GONE!

12:29.516 --> 12:31.015
I LOST IT!

12:31.017 --> 12:32.417
DON'T FREAK.
WE'LL RETRACE OUR STEPS.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.052
WHAT?!
RETRACE OUR STEPS?!

12:34.054 --> 12:36.121
ANDIE, WE WERE ALL OVER TOWN
COLLECTING CLOTHING TODAY.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.589
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
I MEAN, IT COULD BE--

12:37.590 --> 12:39.056
IT COULD BE AT CLANCY'S ,
IT COULD BE AT THE MALL

12:39.059 --> 12:41.059
IT COULD BE AT FRANK'S
MAKE-YOUR-OWN MEAT PIE FACTORY.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.360
( sharply gasps )

12:42.362 --> 12:45.063
OR WORSE,
IN A MEAT PIE.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.633
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M GONNA
SCHLEP ALL THE WAY TO FRANK'S
AND NOT MAKE A MEAT PIE?!

12:49.569 --> 12:51.169
ANDIE, HELP ME LOOK.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.171
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO FIND IT.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.172
HOW ARE YOU GONNA TELL MADDIE
AFTER YOU FREAKED WHEN SHE LOST
HER CHARMS?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.542
( incredulously )
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA TELL HER.

12:57.544 --> 13:01.212
RIGHT! SHE'LL JUST KNOW
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TWIN TELEPATHY.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.999
WE DO NOT HAVE TELEPATHY!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.684
BESIDES, IF IT TELL HER,
THEN SHE'S GONNA PLAY
THE DISAPPOINTMENT CARD,

13:07.687 --> 13:09.220
AND THEN
I'M GONNA GET DEFENSIVE,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.623
AND THEN
SHE'S GONNA LASH OUT, AND...

13:11.625 --> 13:13.424
THE DELICATE BALANCE OF
OUR TWIN BOND WILL BE RUINED!

13:14.361 --> 13:16.394
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GONNA LIE.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.298
YEAH, I'M GONNA LIE
TO PROTECT THE FUTURE
OF OUR SISTERHOOD.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.136
OR YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN SHE'S RIGHT,
AND YOU'RE WRONG.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.172
YOU AND I ARE
VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
BUT YOU TOTALLY GET ME.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.145
MOM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR DOING THIS WITH ME.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.581
I MEAN, IT MAKES WORKING OUT
SO MUCH MORE FUN

13:36.583 --> 13:38.249
WHEN YOU HAVE
A WORKOUT BUDDY.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.317
I LOVE YOU.

13:39.319 --> 13:46.057
WHICH IS JUST GONNA MAKE
CRUSHING YOUR SAFARI STEPPIN'
DREAMS ALL THAT MUCH SWEETER!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.458
BAM! WHAT?!

13:49.162 --> 13:52.147
( device beeping )

13:52.148 --> 13:55.133
Safari Stepper:
<i>Maddie, you've completed</i>
<i>12,642 steps.</i>

14:14.221 --> 14:16.154
WELL, I DEMAND A REMATCH,
YOUNG LADY.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.121
SAME TIME TOMORROW?

14:17.123 --> 14:19.390
OH, YOU'RE ON... SLOTH.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.159
( devices beep )

14:22.229 --> 14:23.595
- HEY, SO, MOM.
- MM-HMM?

14:23.597 --> 14:25.129
NOW THAT YOU ARE
IN YOUR YOGA PANTS,

14:25.131 --> 14:27.732
I, PERSONALLY, WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU DO THOSE SPLITS.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.300
OH, GLADLY.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.238
( gasps )
OH.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.610
LITTLE HELP UP HERE.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.213
CAN'T.
TOO BUSY WINNING!

14:42.215 --> 14:43.815
WHAT?

14:43.817 --> 14:45.750
MADDIE, NO!

14:45.752 --> 14:49.120
OH, JOEY.
( panting )

14:49.122 --> 14:53.157
WELL, WELL, WELL, WHO NEEDS

JUST SPENDING TIME

15:20.086 --> 15:21.252
HEY, DUDE.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.221
I'M AT CLANCY'S
WITH THE TWERP.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.324
HEY, YOU'D THINK A KID
SMART ENOUGH TO BE IN
HIGH SCHOOL ROBOTICS

15:26.326 --> 15:29.227
WOULD REALIZE WHEN
HE'S BEING USED AS CHICK BAIT.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.261
WHAT A DUMMY.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.264
OH, I GOTTA GO.

15:35.802 --> 15:40.138
TODD STETSON IS USING
MY LITTLE BROTHER TO GET GIRLS?

15:40.874 --> 15:42.607
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

15:47.213 --> 15:48.413
OLD MAN LUKE,

15:48.415 --> 15:50.415
I'M YOUR CHICK BAIT?

15:57.190 --> 15:58.256
( snoring )

16:07.167 --> 16:10.268
OKAY, ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU CAN MAKE AN EXACT COPY

16:10.270 --> 16:12.237
OF MADDIE'S BRACELET?

16:12.238 --> 16:14.205
- YEAH, ONCE I GET A PICTURE,
I CAN REBUILD ANYTHING.
- OKAY.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.274
I CRASHED MY BROTHER'S BIKE,
AND HE'S BEEN RIDING ONE

16:16.276 --> 16:18.242
MADE OUT OF MELTED FORKS
FOR TWO YEARS.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.144
( mouths )

16:27.420 --> 16:28.486
( snorts )

16:36.162 --> 16:37.228
OKAY.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.899
( camera shutter clicking )

16:41.901 --> 16:43.735
GOOD.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.638
( quietly shrieks )

16:47.640 --> 16:50.174
- OKAY.
- SO...

16:50.176 --> 16:52.477
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DRAW ON HER,
MUSTACHE OR UNIBROW?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.214
WHAT?
WHY-- WHY WOULD WE
DRAW ON HER?

16:57.617 --> 17:00.251
YOUR HOUSE IS
<i>SO  </i> DIFFERENT THAN MINE,

17:01.755 --> 17:03.287
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.894
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

17:12.932 --> 17:14.665
YOU SHALL NOT
DO THAT AGAIN.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.469
OKAY, LISTEN, TODD.
I WAS AT CLANCY'S.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.238
I HEARD YOU TALKING
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.974
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST USING
MY LITTLE BROTHER TO GET GIRLS.

17:22.976 --> 17:24.542
SO WHAT?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.712
WELL, HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER,
NOT YOUR LITTLE PUPPY.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.381
SO BACK OFF,
OR ELSE.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.250
OR ELSE WHAT?

17:32.252 --> 17:34.952
- ARE YOU GONNA FIGHT ME?
- ( scoffs )

17:34.954 --> 17:37.405
FIGHT?

17:37.406 --> 17:39.857
WHAT AM I,
SOME 21st CENTURY
HOOLIGAN, TODD?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.360
WE SHALL JOUST,
KIND SIR!

17:43.296 --> 17:47.265
WITH SCOOTERS FOR STEEDS
AND WET MOPS FOR LANCES.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.966
YEAH, NONE OF THAT
IS HAPPENING.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.702
HEY, TODD.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.271
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
ISN'T HAPPENING?

17:53.273 --> 17:53.971
YOU AND ME.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.941
I'M GIVING YOU
YOUR AIR HOCKEY PUCK BACK.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.743
GO FETCH!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.346
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
HAPPENING EITHER.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.284
HEY.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.286
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO HEAR ANY OF THAT.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.655
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT WAS EPIC!

18:10.657 --> 18:12.023
THANKS FOR STANDING UP
FOR ME, MUNCH.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.624
ANY TIME, LITTLE BRO.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.929
SO, DO WE, LIKE,
HUG IT OUT NOW?

18:17.931 --> 18:20.364
NO! WE JOUST!

18:21.267 --> 18:23.334
<i>( fanfare playing )</i>

18:52.298 --> 18:54.499

18:54.501 --> 18:56.501
NOT THE FACE!
NOT THE FACE!

18:57.570 --> 19:00.304
OH, THIS WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.774
I DRANK A LITTLE
MOP WATER THAT DAY.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.943
NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE TASTED IT, BUT...

19:05.945 --> 19:07.678
DEFINITELY THE SWEETEST.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.447
OW! PARKER, QUIT IT!

19:16.022 --> 19:18.356
GREAT WORK
ON THESE CHARMS, ANDIE.

19:18.358 --> 19:22.460
I MADE THE HONESTY CHARM
FROM MY BROTHER'S CAR KEY.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.062
( chuckles )
YEP, IT IS PERFECT.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.664
MADDIE WILL NEVER KNOW.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.000
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.568
( nervously chuckles )

19:32.038 --> 19:36.541
( loudly ) HEY...

19:36.543 --> 19:37.608
MADDIE.

19:39.779 --> 19:42.847
HEY, LIV.
I AM SO READY
FOR THOSE WisPs.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.050
( both laugh )
WisPs...

19:47.453 --> 19:49.687
YEAH, I GOT MY LUCKY
TWIN CHARM BRACELET
RIGHT HERE.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.055
YEP, ME TOO!
I DO TOO!

19:51.057 --> 19:52.924
BUT WHERE MY--
I PUT MINE ON MY NECK

19:52.926 --> 19:55.359
I ALWAYS HAVE--
WHERE I KEEP IT--
WHERE-- WHERE MY NECK IS.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.061
<i>( laughs nervously )</i>

19:57.063 --> 19:58.780
HUH, YEAH, OKAY.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.498
WELL, I THINK I'M PROBABLY
JUST GONNA MEET
YOU GUYS INSIDE.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.001
I HAVE TO SHARPEN UP
MY #2 PENCILS.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.503
YEAH, YOU DO.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.638
YOU GO, GIRL!
YOU DO YOU!

20:07.640 --> 20:09.040
<i>WHOO!</i>
<i>( chuckles nervously )</i>

20:12.579 --> 20:15.713
UH, YOU--
YOU USED TO BE
AN ACTRESS, RIGHT?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.748
HURTFUL WORDS.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.120
BUT I DID IT.
I AM IN THE CLEAR.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.723
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER,
AREN'T YOU?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.225
I HAVE TO!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.726
THESE CHARMS ARE LIES
BURNING INTO MY NECK.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.795
MADDIE!

20:30.796 --> 20:32.863
I LOST MY CHARMS
AND THEN I USED YOUR CHARMS
TO MAKE REPLACEMENT CHARMS,

20:32.865 --> 20:34.432
BECAUSE I FELT SO BAD
ABOUT YOUR CHARMS.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.000
AND I BROKE THE DELICATE
BALANCE OF OUR TWIN BOND,

20:36.002 --> 20:38.402
AND I JUST DON'T
DESERVE YOU!

20:39.672 --> 20:42.673
WHOA, LIV.
IT IS JUST A NECKLACE.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.309
NO, BUT, MADDIE,
IT'S NOT JUST A NECKLACE.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.944
IT'S THE THING THAT WE USED
TO KEEP EACH OTHER CLOSE
WHEN WE WERE SO FAR APART.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.414
YEAH, BUT, LIV,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.183
WE'RE NOT SO FAR APART
ANYMORE.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.985
AND I MEAN,

20:53.987 --> 20:57.088
THESE CHARMS WILL
ALWAYS BE SPECIAL,
BUT WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.155
YOU KNOW?

21:00.526 --> 21:02.093
( scoffs )

21:02.095 --> 21:04.495
MADDIE, THAT WAS
SO SWEET.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.732
I SHOULD HAVE SAID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO YOU
WHEN YOU LOST YOURS...

21:07.734 --> 21:10.101
INSTEAD OF
MAKING YOU FEEL
SO TERRIBLE ABOUT IT

21:10.103 --> 21:11.168
AND RUBBING YOUR NOSE
IN IT.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.038
I'M SORRY.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.540
( sighs )

21:16.542 --> 21:18.643
THERE IT IS.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.077

HERE ARE YOUR CHARMS.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.118

21:27.120 --> 21:29.887
YEAH, I STOLE HER CHARMS
TO TEACH HER A LESSON.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.990
I KNEW THAT THE CHARMS
THAT SHE WAS WEARING
WERE COPIES,

21:32.992 --> 21:35.893
BECAUSE I WAS AWAKE
THE WHOLE TIME THOSE TWO
WERE IN MY ROOM.

21:35.895 --> 21:39.630
YOU DO NOT SURVIVE
AT BASKETBALL CAMP IF
YOU ARE A HEAVY SLEEPER.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.633
( gasps )

21:42.635 --> 21:44.835
THANK YOU.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.137

- BUT IT WORKED.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.042
BUT THAT'S THE PART

AN ARGUMENT?

21:55.515 --> 21:59.083

WAY DIFFERENT THAN MINE.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.053
( Todd screaming )

22:02.055 --> 22:03.954

THE HOUSE OF ROONEY!

22:03.956 --> 22:06.657
( Parker and Joey yelling )

22:06.659 --> 22:08.993
Both:

22:10.096 --> 22:12.163
Both:

22:13.533 --> 22:14.899

<i>King of the jungle.</i>

22:54.941 --> 22:57.274
<i>( fanfare plays )</i>

22:57.276 --> 23:00.611

23:19.065 --> 23:20.831
AND I'M GOING TO NEED

23:20.833 --> 23:23.000
THAT GIANT SUPER SOAKER

23:23.002 --> 23:24.168
FINE.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.570
I'D ALSO LIKE
A PIGGYBACK RIDE
TO THE CAR.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.772
( laughs )

23:27.774 --> 23:28.939
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.675
OKAY, SADDLE UP.
