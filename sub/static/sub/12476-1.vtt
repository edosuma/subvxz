00:02.436 --> 00:04.036
<i> My name is Ben Burke. </i>
Happy birthday, sweetie.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.505
<i> My father was a Secret Service</i>
<i> agent in Seattle.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:07.873
<i> He disappeared</i>
<i> in a small Idaho town</i>

00:07.875 --> 00:09.708
<i> called Wayward Pines.</i>

00:09.710 --> 00:11.443
<i> My mother and I</i>
<i> followed him there...</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:13.545
<i> ...and when we woke up,</i>

00:13.547 --> 00:15.114
<i> it was 2,000 years later.</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:18.384
<i> We are now in the year 4032.</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:21.186
<i> Man's destruction</i>
<i> of the environment</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:23.355
<i> has created</i>
<i> evolutionary aberrations</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.890
(snarling)
<i> known as Abbies...</i>

00:24.892 --> 00:26.125
(screeching)

00:26.127 --> 00:29.561
<i> ...that rule the Earth.</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:32.564
<i> One man saw</i>
<i> the catastrophe coming.</i>

00:32.566 --> 00:35.300
<i> He created an ark for mankind</i>
<i> and selected a chosen few</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:38.470
<i> to sleep for 2,000 years</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:41.073
<i> and defy mankind's extinction.</i>

00:41.075 --> 00:42.574
<i> Some were there by choice,</i>

00:42.576 --> 00:45.477
<i> but, like us, most were taken</i>
<i> against our will.</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:46.478
How do I get out of here?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.980
You don't.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.216
<i> My father died</i>
<i> defending his family</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.919
<i> and the people of this town</i>
<i> from monsters outside...</i>

00:53.921 --> 00:55.087
(screeching)

00:55.089 --> 00:56.488
Dad!

00:57.591 --> 00:59.425
<i> ...and threats from within.</i>

00:59.427 --> 01:01.093
<i> Three years</i>
<i> after my father's death,</i>

01:01.095 --> 01:03.228
<i> the town is ruled</i>
<i> by the First Generation--</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:04.763
<i> those born in Wayward Pines.</i>

01:04.765 --> 01:08.333
<i>They rose to power and continue</i>
<i> to rule with an iron fist.</i>

01:08.335 --> 01:11.070
(screaming) <i> It wasn't a
world</i> <i> I wanted to live in.</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:13.405
<i> So I vowed to do something</i>
<i> about it,</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:16.041
<i> not just for me and the people</i>
<i> of Wayward Pines,</i>

01:16.043 --> 01:18.410
<i> but the entire human race--</i>

01:18.412 --> 01:21.513
<i> those awake and those heroes</i>
<i> who still sleep,</i>

01:21.515 --> 01:23.715
<i> dreaming of a future</i>
<i> for humanity</i>

01:23.717 --> 01:25.751
<i> as we battle to survive.</i>

01:30.624 --> 01:32.691
(seagulls calling)

01:54.482 --> 01:56.782
I was wondering if I could
borrow your bikini

01:56.784 --> 01:58.550
because you're not using it,

01:58.552 --> 02:02.488
and, uh... I'm going swimming
again tonight.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.889
I'm doing it.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.624
If you don't come with me,

02:05.626 --> 02:07.759
I'm going with that fat guy
over there in billet six.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.061
The one with the hair
on his back.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.837
Two margaritas?

02:18.839 --> 02:22.074
Uh, beer tonight.
She's, uh, resting.

02:22.076 --> 02:24.109
Sure.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.744
(thunder rumbling)

02:27.681 --> 02:30.749
Looks like something
tropical's blowing in.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.255
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.025
Might as well
sit back and relax.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.927
Ain't nobody
getting out of here tonight.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.996
Next one's on me.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.302
This dude stands up again. No.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.104
Right in front of me.
(laughs)

02:52.106 --> 02:54.206
You knocked him out.
You got to tell me that.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.708
Man, as much money
as I paid for them tickets--

02:56.710 --> 02:58.877
$500, man.
I'm talking about

02:58.879 --> 03:00.679
two rows
behind the bench.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.714
If anybody getting thrown out...
Right.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.049
...it's gonna be him.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.552
(laughs)
Yeah.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.720
(coughing)

03:08.722 --> 03:11.323
People, man.

03:11.325 --> 03:14.026
Sometimes you wish you'd just...

03:14.028 --> 03:15.561
start over, right?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.529
Yeah.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.964
Yeah, yeah.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.136
(chuckles)

03:26.974 --> 03:29.408
POPE:
No, I'm serious, man.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.076
Change is coming.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.111
All the stuff we're doing
to this damn planet.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.684
We're in the middle of some...

03:38.686 --> 03:40.819
evolutionary transition.

03:42.756 --> 03:47.759
And there's gonna be
a revolution as a result of it.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.661
You save people, right?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.730
Yup, that's my job.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.736
<i> Salud.</i>

03:58.772 --> 04:01.240
Well, Doc...

04:01.242 --> 04:04.876
if you had a chance

04:04.878 --> 04:09.047
to save 1,000 people at once--

04:09.049 --> 04:13.285
put 'em down
and then wake 'em up...

04:13.287 --> 04:18.123
through some magical,
like, procedure that

04:18.125 --> 04:21.727
you believed in
and knew how to make it work--

04:21.729 --> 04:23.929
you'd do it, right?

04:23.931 --> 04:25.897
Uh...

04:25.899 --> 04:27.366
I'm serious.
I mean,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.301
everybody might think
you're crazy.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.303
Um...

04:31.305 --> 04:33.372
No, you knew.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.943
You are gonna save
a lot of folks, Doc.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.379
A lot of people,
thousands of people

04:40.381 --> 04:43.415
you ain't never even met before,
but you gonna save 'em.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.418
(thunder rumbling) And
I'm glad that I met you.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.920
You know what? I get
a feeling about folks,

04:48.922 --> 04:52.190
and I got a feeling
about you.

04:53.227 --> 04:55.294
(beeping, electrical whirring)

05:20.654 --> 05:22.721
Dr. Yedlin.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.390
Uh...

05:27.528 --> 05:29.194
Hi.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.362
(sniffles)

05:30.364 --> 05:32.597
Oh.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.333
(exhales sharply)

05:34.335 --> 05:35.701
I'm a little embar...

05:35.703 --> 05:38.370
Clearly had a little
too much to drink last night.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.605
I haven't been feeling well.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.773
(sighs)

05:41.775 --> 05:44.376
Hope I didn't cause any trouble.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.247
Okay.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.052
(chuckles)

05:55.222 --> 05:56.488
Okay.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.557
Thank you.
I'll get back to my room.

He's awake.

I'm doing a vacation here

06:22.850 --> 06:25.417

06:25.419 --> 06:26.585

06:26.587 --> 06:28.587

the blood, your militia.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.469
I'm very

12:51.471 --> 12:53.004
confused.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.642
This town is part
of a secret government study

12:57.644 --> 12:59.310
determining
the psychological effects

12:59.312 --> 13:01.212
of war trauma on civilians.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.149
He founded the project.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.484
And all of the people
here are volunteers.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.919
I'm not.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.322
We're in an emergency
tactical role-play right now.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.124
Because you come
highly recommended.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.727
I told Bill Gibbons at Mass
General I wanted only the best.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.929
Bill knows that I'm here?
Of course.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.963
And your wife.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.834
We wanted to bring you along
more traditionally,

13:22.836 --> 13:25.170
but with the storm
in Hawaii...

13:25.172 --> 13:27.906
You don't remember any of that,
do you? (chuckles)

13:27.908 --> 13:30.508
Anyway, she thought
that it would be better...

13:30.510 --> 13:32.443
Well, she thought that

13:32.445 --> 13:34.445
you'd enjoy getting
right back to work.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.780
Rebecca did?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.448
Of course.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.683
She's on her way here right now.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.151
She keeps telling us
this is the longest

13:40.153 --> 13:41.653
she's ever been away from you.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.691
I know this is... unorthodox,
which is why it'd be better

13:46.693 --> 13:48.359
for me to fill you in
on the details later.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.795
I think the best thing
would be

13:50.797 --> 13:52.363
to just put that all aside
for the moment

13:52.365 --> 13:56.201
and just focus on the patient,
focus on what's real.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.802
Can we do that,
Doctor?

13:57.804 --> 14:00.104
Right now, we can't really wait.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.609
She's important.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.679
Well, they're all
important, aren't they?

14:07.681 --> 14:11.616
Every life should be
cherished, treasured.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.786
That's something very important
to us in Wayward Pines.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.955
But she's more
important than most.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.489
That is for certain.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.826
She's septic.
It's been that way for days.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.329
Why wasn't she treated
or moved?

14:24.331 --> 14:27.165
We have nurses and a
team that are waiting.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.434
You're the missing
piece, Dr. Yedlin.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.343
THEO:
Get me a pot of black coffee.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.411
No sugar.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.882
We can do that.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.490

air pumping)

14:59.599 --> 15:00.932
Scalpel.

Yes, Doctor.

JASON:
You're wasting time, Doctor.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.792
KERRY: So that's four more
rebel houses cleared today.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.295
Yes, ma'am.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.963
How's the surgery
going?

15:31.965 --> 15:33.698
He says it will take hours.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.336
Tell me, Kerry.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.645
We lost another one
of our men tonight.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.384
Oh, hey.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.154
I bet it was Xander.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.222
Where's he been?

15:59.726 --> 16:00.992
He just got back.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.360
I don't trust him.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.332
Two more died earlier today
in the hospital.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.334
So three today.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.971
Added to the losses
in the previous

16:12.973 --> 16:14.172
few weeks...

16:14.174 --> 16:17.742
Where are you, Ben?

16:17.744 --> 16:21.179
Mario says
we're making progress.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.348
And there's no sign of abnormal
or increased activity

16:23.350 --> 16:26.351
outside the fence, according
to the latest surveillance.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.087
He'd be disappointed in me.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.756
You're doing
everything you can.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.359
MEGAN: If they'd gone along
with you and Pilcher

16:34.361 --> 16:35.994

16:35.996 --> 16:38.663
it never would have
come to this.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.331
JASON:
Every life matters here.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.499
He taught us that.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.002
Yes, but the cause
is most important.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.005
He'd understand
how essential it is

16:47.007 --> 16:51.442
to end this rebellion
and weed out the troublemakers,

16:51.444 --> 16:54.445
once and for all.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.881
Clear rules,
severe punishment.

16:56.883 --> 16:57.882
Clear...

16:57.884 --> 16:58.883
Clear and severe.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.051
Exactly.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.620
It's the only way.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.525
Mario needs you.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.973
(indistinct radio transmission,
quiet chatter)

17:26.813 --> 17:29.013
XANDER: Ben, I'm telling you,
we just have to keep

17:29.015 --> 17:31.749
picking 'em off,
one by one.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.084
He's all about the numbers.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.653
He's gonna want to bring you in
and talk things through.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.989
(sighs) But, Xander,
then nothing will change.

17:37.991 --> 17:40.725
Rallies, the propaganda,
the reckonings.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.993
We can't escape.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.662
We need to change Wayward
Pines from the inside.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.931
Yeah, well,
I changed it some tonight.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.933
I mean, we at least
need to have a say

17:48.935 --> 17:50.668
in how we live
our lives.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.537
(sighs)

17:52.539 --> 17:55.673
Otherwise, my dad
and all those deaths,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.742

to lower your standards, kid.

passive-aggressive.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.220
I am sincerely

28:43.222 --> 28:44.922
trying to-to...

28:45.925 --> 28:47.591
Look, I want your success.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.093
This is not
about my work.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.427
I am not threatened by it.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.496
Listen to yourself!
What are you even...?

28:52.498 --> 28:53.931
I'm trying to fix this.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.933
And I appreciate that.

28:55.935 --> 29:01.205
You know, marriage is not
a triple bypass.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.706
Uh, yeah, I'm aware of that.
You know why?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.274
'Cause it's a lot harder.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.176
This is not a problem to solve.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.512
You don't have to try
to fix everything

29:08.514 --> 29:10.714
all the time.
I'm built that way!

29:10.716 --> 29:11.849
Well, I'm not built that way.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.884
You just have
to accept it.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.953
I don't.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.021
Theo?

29:24.964 --> 29:28.031
(window rattling)

29:39.612 --> 29:40.677
(loud thud on window)

29:46.051 --> 29:48.051
It's okay.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.453
I'm here to help you.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.722
Come with me. I'll
get you out of here.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.829
Here, come on.
Did Kate talk to Jason?

29:58.831 --> 30:01.231
Who? Kate. Kate. The
woman in the hospital.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.333
She's alive, right?
Yes.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.601
Okay, did she talk to Jason?

30:04.603 --> 30:06.336
Did she say anything to Jason?
I don't know.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.805
Look, it's very important.
Listen to me.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.307
Did she tell him anything?
Names, addresses, anything?

30:10.309 --> 30:12.009
I said I don't know.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.778
Did she say
anything to you?

30:14.780 --> 30:17.147
Group C.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.216
I'm gonna go
find my wife.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.152
I'm gonna get home.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.221
(crowd chattering)

30:27.526 --> 30:30.360
You are home.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.095
Follow me.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.098
Time to go.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.503
You're not gonna
want to see this.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.282
KERRY:
Are you sure about this?

30:52.284 --> 30:55.352
Short-term pain,
long-term gain, remember?

30:55.354 --> 30:58.388
They won't love
you for it.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.357
I don't need their love.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.459
And this is on Kate.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.899
Thank you for coming.

31:08.901 --> 31:12.069
Good afternoon to all of you
here on Main Street

31:12.071 --> 31:15.038
and all of you listening
throughout Wayward Pines.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.407
(over radio): I know there are
some of you who disagree with

31:17.409 --> 31:20.744
the direction of this town
over the past few years.

31:20.746 --> 31:23.480
The curfews, the rationing.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.782
I know I'm not the leader
that Pilcher was.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.988
I'm not the leader
you want me to be.

31:30.990 --> 31:34.258
But Pilcher
wouldn't want this.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.828
This month-long rebellion
helps no one.

31:37.830 --> 31:40.097
We need to work together as

31:40.099 --> 31:44.768
Pilcher intended, and figure out
how to defeat our real enemies.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.672
The ones that attacked us
on Invasion Day.

31:48.674 --> 31:53.110
Because even if we disagree
on some things,

31:53.112 --> 31:56.280
the survival of this town is
one thing we can all agree on.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.115
WOMAN:
That's right.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.183
(crowd cheering)

32:04.790 --> 32:07.190
So I'd like to announce
a general amnesty

32:07.192 --> 32:08.792
for anyone who comes forward.

32:08.794 --> 32:13.463
I'm asking you
to put down your weapons.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.565
Now is the time
for us to come together

32:15.567 --> 32:18.135
and make Wayward Pines
whole again.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.970
(hushed murmuring)

32:19.972 --> 32:21.138
Anyone?

32:23.375 --> 32:27.144
Followers of Ben
and his rebellion,

32:27.146 --> 32:28.712
give yourselves up now,

32:28.714 --> 32:31.114
and there will be no more need
for bloodshed.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.385
(hushed murmuring continues)

32:43.495 --> 32:45.529
(microphone feedback hums)

32:46.899 --> 32:48.966
I tried.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.972
Come on, let's go.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.076
Keep walking.

32:59.078 --> 33:02.179
JASON: I have offered you
a peaceful way out.

33:02.181 --> 33:04.581
Now I have no choice.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.818
I am doing
what Pilcher would have done.

33:07.820 --> 33:11.521
I'm doing what's best
for Wayward Pines.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.776
Ruby.

33:47.693 --> 33:48.959
(gun clicks)

33:49.895 --> 33:51.895
(crowd gasps)

33:58.570 --> 34:00.404
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

34:01.540 --> 34:02.873
Hey! (grunting)

34:02.875 --> 34:04.174
THEO: I'm a doctor. Theo?

34:04.176 --> 34:05.475
Hey!

34:06.879 --> 34:08.412
Rebecca?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.281
JASON:
Enough!

34:13.085 --> 34:15.085
(gun clicks)

34:15.087 --> 34:16.753
WOMAN:
No, no, no!

34:16.755 --> 34:19.389
(crowd murmuring)

34:19.391 --> 34:21.725
BEN:
Jason! We heard you!

34:21.727 --> 34:23.727
You want to stop
the killing,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.495
want to move forward
together, we're here.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.332
Take them.

34:32.671 --> 34:33.970
(soldiers chattering)

34:35.107 --> 34:36.973
Take the doctor, too.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.447
(panting)

34:48.287 --> 34:49.586
(engine starts)

34:49.588 --> 34:52.055
JASON (over P.A.):
Good citizens of Wayward Pines,

34:52.057 --> 34:53.924
the rebellion is over.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.425
For your safety,

34:55.427 --> 34:58.462
suspected rebels will be
detained and questioned.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.897
Your streets are safe.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.633
Work hard, be happy,

35:03.635 --> 35:06.536
enjoy your life
in Wayward Pines.

35:25.958 --> 35:27.157
Theo.

35:27.159 --> 35:29.459
Thank God you're safe.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.795
You're okay.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.565
Listen, Rebecca,
I need you to listen to me.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.100
We have to
leave right now.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.401
No. Relax. It's okay.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.837
Don't listen to
anything they say.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.172
It's not safe.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.407
Something's rotten here.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.176
MARIO:
Dr. Yedlin.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.345
Xander.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.748
Jason would like to
speak with you. Now.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.351
Let's go.

35:54.353 --> 35:57.521
REBECCA:
I'll be waiting for you.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.706
Gentlemen.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.708
The rebellion is over.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.477
We need to start fresh.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.612
I was hoping you could
come up to the mountain,

36:22.614 --> 36:24.281
share a meal with me,

36:24.283 --> 36:26.183
talk about the future
of Wayward Pines.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.886
You need to tell me
what's happening here.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.288
Everything.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.557
I will.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.625
Just get
in the car, Doctor.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.813
(car door closes)

37:00.586 --> 37:02.085
You start fresh.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.154
It's just a precaution.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.962
(groans)

37:15.834 --> 37:17.701
The First Generation
can never harm another.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.002
I'm not harming Ben.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.570
And Theo? You said
it was an emergency.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.771
You said you
were putting him

37:21.773 --> 37:23.240
back to sleep.

37:23.242 --> 37:25.242
He's skilled. We need doctors.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.943
We need our own doctors.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.345
Residents are almost ready.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.751
(sighs)

37:34.753 --> 37:38.021
I'm not taking
any chances with him.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.957
I don't want
another Ethan Burke.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.960
I think it's
a mistake.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.363
(engine starts)

38:00.879 --> 38:02.946
MEGAN:
The rebellion is over, Kate.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.318
Your men have surrendered.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.986
You fought hard.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.555
All of us, so impressed.

38:15.460 --> 38:19.129
I know you believed
in your cause,

38:19.131 --> 38:21.998
but it's time
for us all to move forward

38:22.000 --> 38:24.067
for the good
of Wayward Pines.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.904
Why are you here?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.307
Jason sent me.

38:30.309 --> 38:32.676
He wants to talk to you
about the future.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.944
When you're up on your feet
again, of course.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.179
(chuckles softly)

38:36.181 --> 38:38.848
We can't discuss the past,
can we, Megan?

38:38.850 --> 38:41.017
But the future--

38:41.019 --> 38:43.820
that we can debate
forever and ever.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.022
I know a lot has happened,
a lot of

38:46.024 --> 38:49.092
angry words,
words that hurt.

38:49.094 --> 38:52.662
And also some deaths.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.765
But we can work together, Kate.

38:55.767 --> 38:56.933
I just know it.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.870
Me, too.

39:00.872 --> 39:04.941
I think it's time to... let go.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.010
(sighs)

39:08.880 --> 39:12.148
Oh, gosh, your pain medication's
getting low.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.384
As if you don't have enough
to worry about.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.619
I think I still remember
how to do this.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.788
It's funny how the training
never really leaves you.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.690
These nurses here--
I keep telling Jason

39:20.692 --> 39:22.392
that ever since they lost Pam,

39:22.394 --> 39:25.295
they've been
at sixes and sevens.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.136
(grunting)

39:36.241 --> 39:38.875
(both panting)

39:38.877 --> 39:39.943
(groans)

39:47.085 --> 39:49.953
You just can't find a way
to get along, can you?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.657
(gasping)

40:00.932 --> 40:04.033
We've done so many great things.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.102
So many.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.604
(panting)

40:07.606 --> 40:09.939
The pyramids.

40:09.941 --> 40:12.776
Man on the moon.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.345
The Beatles.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.682
We were capable of so much.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.288
But now it's your world,
your future.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.091
And...

40:28.093 --> 40:30.860
(gasping)

40:30.862 --> 40:34.364
And I don't want any part of it.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.802
(gagging)

40:38.804 --> 40:40.537
(groans, gasps)

40:48.146 --> 40:50.213
(panting)

40:54.953 --> 40:57.020
(electrical buzzing)

41:11.269 --> 41:13.269
Where are we?

41:13.271 --> 41:15.138
What's on the other side
of the fence?

41:15.140 --> 41:16.573
(grunts)

41:16.575 --> 41:18.007
(beeps)

41:18.009 --> 41:19.976
(alarm blaring)

41:19.978 --> 41:21.411
Mario!

41:21.413 --> 41:22.512
What are you doing?!

41:22.514 --> 41:24.314
Mario, come back!

41:24.316 --> 41:25.748
(grunting)

41:25.750 --> 41:28.418
Mario!
Mario!

41:28.420 --> 41:30.820
No! No.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.427
(crashing)

41:37.429 --> 41:40.163
(alarm continues blaring)

41:40.165 --> 41:42.065
(heavy metallic thud)

41:46.605 --> 41:49.606
(phone ringing)

41:51.610 --> 41:55.078
(several phones ringing)

42:03.355 --> 42:06.456
(phone ringing)

42:21.740 --> 42:23.740
(phone continues ringing)

42:23.742 --> 42:25.808
(electrical buzzing)

42:33.652 --> 42:36.619
(exhales)

42:38.590 --> 42:40.089
(growling)

42:40.091 --> 42:42.425
No!

42:42.427 --> 42:43.993
(electrical crackling)

42:43.995 --> 42:46.629
(wild shrieking, growling)

42:51.603 --> 42:53.136
(shrieking, electrical crackling
continues)
