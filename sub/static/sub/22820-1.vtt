<i>Quiet, please!
Quiet, please!</i>

00:49.502 --> 00:52.829
<i>There it is, the cathedral of tennis,
Center Court, Wimbledon...</i>

00:52.830 --> 00:56.741
<i>and the two top players in the world,
Björn Borg and John McEnroe...</i>

00:56.742 --> 00:58.403
<i>are about to come out.</i>

00:59.897 --> 01:03.346
<i>It's the perfect rivalry:
the baseline player and the net rusher.</i>

01:03.347 --> 01:05.776
<i>Ice-Borg versus Super-Brat!</i>

01:05.787 --> 01:10.100
<i>Björn Borg, four championships in a row,
aiming for a fifth.</i>

01:42.472 --> 01:44.718
<i>Björn Borg has broken McEnroe!</i>

01:45.300 --> 01:51.045
<i>McEnroe again set love.
It's dead even!</i>

01:55.513 --> 02:00.735
<i>Quiet, please!
Final set. Borg Serving.</i>

05:13.100 --> 05:15.456
- Good luck at Wimbledon!
- Thank you.

05:15.601 --> 05:16.929
Björn...

05:17.146 --> 05:18.866
make sure you bring home
the trophy now, ha?

05:18.928 --> 05:20.001
I'll do my best.

06:04.392 --> 06:05.704
Here you go.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.407
You selling these?

06:08.420 --> 06:12.900
Björn! Björn!
Björn Borg! Björn, Björn!

06:19.517 --> 06:22.500
Ah, sorry. Don't,
don't speak French.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.700
Coffee.

06:46.351 --> 06:47.865
Do you speak English?

06:48.725 --> 06:50.287
- Just a...
- A little.

06:50.642 --> 06:53.500
Can I come in with
the money later?

06:54.351 --> 06:56.516
Because I left my wallet in the car.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.225
- No, no, no...
- No?

06:58.226 --> 06:59.574
No!

07:21.059 --> 07:22.900
"BORG'S WORST NIGHTMARE"

07:33.601 --> 07:36.489
Okay? It's, it's everything...

07:37.142 --> 07:39.800
Thank you... Amedou.

07:39.809 --> 07:41.900
My name is Rune.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.600
- Rune?
- Rune. Rune. It's a...

07:44.851 --> 07:47.700
- Rune? Ha, ha, ha!
- Swedish.

07:48.809 --> 07:50.753
What do you do?

07:51.976 --> 07:57.666
I work as ah... an electrician.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yes.

08:12.101 --> 08:14.160
You like electric?

08:15.642 --> 08:17.417
Yes it's...

08:18.434 --> 08:23.500
Yeah, it's a... it's a very good job.
It's a normal job.

09:12.517 --> 09:13.725
Out!

09:13.726 --> 09:17.077
Fuck! Out? That is a break point.
Get down and look at it!

09:18.351 --> 09:20.058
Shut the fuck up!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.660
If you don't want to heed
my warning and you think

09:21.684 --> 09:23.308
my dad's gonna appeal it,
that's on you, my man.

09:23.309 --> 09:25.132
That's not on me.
And I don't really wanna give a

09:25.156 --> 09:26.676
shit about the crowd how I do wrong...

09:28.184 --> 09:31.286
This is out! This is in!
Fuck!

09:31.393 --> 09:34.080
I have to ask if you want to continue
playing, Mr. McEnroe.

09:34.267 --> 09:38.913
Fuck! There's a bit any mistakes officiating
wise today at all? Answer the question!

09:39.351 --> 09:42.500
The question, you joke,
Answer the question!

09:43.642 --> 09:45.600
You're stopping? You're stopping play?

09:45.601 --> 09:48.023
The man the New York Times
described as being the

09:48.223 --> 09:51.200
worst representative of American
values since Al Capone...

09:52.184 --> 09:54.800
Ladies and gentlemen, John McEnroe!

10:02.184 --> 10:05.334
So John, you have upset anybody out
in the wings, yet?

10:05.601 --> 10:07.577
No, not that I know. Not yet.

10:08.601 --> 10:10.790
No, I... I like you, John, you're great.

10:11.476 --> 10:13.475
- And in three days...
- Three days.

10:13.476 --> 10:15.058
- You go to London...
- Yap.

10:15.059 --> 10:16.786
To play Wimbledon.

10:16.809 --> 10:18.600
And everyone's talking about

10:18.601 --> 10:22.747
Björn Borg's chance to win his fifth
straight title and make tennis history.

10:22.767 --> 10:28.090
Now, apparently the only thing standing
between Borg and that record is you.

10:30.975 --> 10:33.924
Here's what they're saying
of you in London...

10:34.124 --> 10:36.942
where you're hardly making any friends.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.034
John, I got to ask you.
What is it that you've done to the Brits?

10:40.059 --> 10:41.490
Ya, I don't know.

10:42.101 --> 10:43.725
It's a different place, you know.

10:43.800 --> 10:47.650
It's a different culture, and they have
warm beer, and it's just a different thing.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.000
Have you, have you got a plan to get
them to stop booing.

10:51.059 --> 10:53.450
I mean, I plan to go in there
and play my game.

10:53.601 --> 10:59.800
And if I beat Borg in the finals, it's very
hard to boo me for bein' number one, so...

11:18.600 --> 11:20.000
How do you feel about John McEnroe?

11:20.434 --> 11:24.900
Well, here is what the
press here is saying.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.558
I can be anybody's nightmare,
though, you know.

11:27.559 --> 11:29.974
But I guess I wound not be exaggerating
if I were to say...

11:29.975 --> 11:33.808
that you and Borg are as different as two
people could possibly be...

11:33.809 --> 11:36.018
You keep going back to Borg.
Is he backstage or somethin'?

11:36.042 --> 11:37.682
Is he gonna like jumpin' out of the cake?

11:40.559 --> 11:42.819
Well, we keep talkin' about him,
you know I'm here.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.691
I'm... with interviews, here we are.

11:44.809 --> 11:49.583
Is is that Borg is often described as being
"pure perfection" and "zero emotion".

11:49.726 --> 11:51.869
You think he ever losses it?

11:52.309 --> 11:54.300
I don't know.

12:20.684 --> 12:22.725
We spent the whole fucking
interview talking about Borg.

12:22.726 --> 12:24.850
On the phone, you said we would be talking
about the future of tennis.

12:24.851 --> 12:27.142
- Now you gonna bullshit while I'm in here.
- That's not what we discussed.

12:27.143 --> 12:30.127
I'm so fuck up every fuckin' time, eh!
Fuck this shit!

12:30.142 --> 12:31.926
They promised, dad,
this is pointless, man.

12:32.126 --> 12:32.891
You did fine.

12:32.892 --> 12:35.202
- You did fine, that's everything!
- That's their fuckin' tone.

12:35.226 --> 12:38.625
Two days to go, Arthur, and
everybody's talking about Björn Borg,

12:38.726 --> 12:41.225
the Swede, who would only 24,

12:41.226 --> 12:43.391
could make history by winning
his fifth Wimbledon.

12:43.392 --> 12:45.867
Can McEnroe pull Borg
from his throne, Arthur?

12:46.017 --> 12:48.475
Borg would be playing under
tremendous amount of pressure.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.225
Everyone expects him to win.

12:50.226 --> 12:52.997
McEnroe, on the other hand, he is
the perfect underdog.

12:53.184 --> 12:56.120
You played them both.
Who's the toughest opponent?

12:56.559 --> 12:58.433
McEnroe is the bigger talent,

12:58.434 --> 13:01.370
But, playing Borg is like being hit
by a sledgehammer.

13:01.392 --> 13:04.874
But if Borg is a sledgehammer,
I'd say that McEnroe is stiletto.

13:04.976 --> 13:08.350
Fast here, and slice there, suddenly,
you're covered in blood,

13:08.351 --> 13:11.074
even though none of the wounds
are particularly deep, and then...

13:12.393 --> 13:13.767
you bleed to death.

13:13.768 --> 13:15.200
6 thousand! 6 thousand!

13:58.851 --> 14:02.582
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Borg
would be here in a moment.

14:02.601 --> 14:05.075
Any questions for the other players?

14:06.601 --> 14:08.577
Did he win already?

14:29.434 --> 14:31.114
How does it feel
knowing that you will make

14:31.248 --> 14:32.808
history if you win
your fifth Wimbledon?

14:33.143 --> 14:35.037
No special feelings.

15:06.726 --> 15:08.683
This is for the fall of '82.

15:08.684 --> 15:11.059
It's two years away, so you don't
need to think about it now...

15:11.060 --> 15:14.043
just so you know, we're
aiming mostly for Asia.

15:14.226 --> 15:17.874
Exhibition tournaments in Japan, South
Korea, Hong Kong... maybe China...

15:17.893 --> 15:19.833
and then, South Africa.

15:19.976 --> 15:22.285
Um, I think we said no to South Africa.

15:22.393 --> 15:27.083
- It's a million dollars for one match.
- Yes, but it's also supporting apartheid.

15:41.977 --> 15:43.870
Put here, thank you.

15:45.143 --> 15:48.017
Soon, you're gonna need another room
for those wedding gifts.

15:48.018 --> 15:51.184
We got an offer from Daily Mail
for the photo rights for your wedding.

15:51.185 --> 15:53.892
- What was the other offer, Andy?
- Ah, the Post, 200.

15:53.893 --> 15:56.684
No, we decided on a private wedding.

15:56.685 --> 15:59.226
Well, that is exactly why you
should sell the rights.

15:59.227 --> 16:02.293
Otherwise, you'll get 50 paparazzis
hiding in the bushes.

16:31.559 --> 16:33.951
We got some advertising campaigns...

17:46.226 --> 17:51.704
Hi, there. Hey, can I make a request?
Do you have any black-felted markers?

17:52.060 --> 17:56.537
Like a Sharpie and a big 80 by 80 piece of
paper, like a board, like a poster?

18:01.101 --> 18:03.161
You send up the markers then?

18:07.310 --> 18:08.871
Okay, thank you.

18:20.810 --> 18:24.576
- McEnroe residence.
- Hey, Hi, Mom. Is Dad there?

18:25.102 --> 18:28.225
- No, he's gone proceeding to a client.
- You know when he's gonna be back?

18:28.226 --> 18:31.033
- Think, after lunch.
- Whenever that is...

18:31.310 --> 18:34.330
you think he can call me after the
client then?

18:34.435 --> 18:38.500
- Why you need to talk to him?
- Because it's important. Why else?

18:40.352 --> 18:42.909
- John, don't, don't be angry...
- I'm not!

18:43.476 --> 18:46.365
You are sounding angry...
No, I just don't wanna have this with you.

18:46.435 --> 18:48.851
I don't wanna have this with you.
You know, there's a lot goin' on.

18:48.852 --> 18:51.408
There's a lot going on here, too.

28:15.269 --> 28:16.830
0-15.

28:27.686 --> 28:29.200
40-0.

28:29.269 --> 28:32.684
Björn Borg, world number 1,
is having in an unexpectedly hard time

28:32.685 --> 28:35.124
against the unseeded
Egyptian, El, Shafei.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.794
No, thank you!

28:41.852 --> 28:43.793
I said, no thank you.

28:43.977 --> 28:47.080
I said twi... Oh Pete! Oh my God!

28:48.269 --> 28:51.000
- You good?
- Ya, look.

28:51.019 --> 28:52.830
There it is.

28:56.519 --> 28:59.268
Based on the unit match-up, we see
each other in quarters,

28:59.623 --> 29:01.602
and I got Connors in semi
and Borg in the final.

29:01.603 --> 29:04.586
- How long does it take you?
- About an hour or so.

29:04.769 --> 29:06.643
- You got your wallet?
- Yap.

29:06.644 --> 29:08.454
I got to get out of here, man.

29:08.811 --> 29:10.685
- How's your foot?
- Ya, it's better.

29:10.686 --> 29:12.959
- Yea?
- Yes, I got this ankle supporter.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.661
- It's, ah... working.
- Good.

29:16.144 --> 29:18.334
See how good? We cut here...

29:18.335 --> 29:21.876
- Ya.
- Okay.

29:21.900 --> 29:22.888
- And then we meet here.
- Ya.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.000
- So, you can go this way.
- Okay.

29:24.001 --> 29:26.560
Nash is here. You stop there.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.800
The rest of it, it goes.

29:30.865 --> 29:32.500
I mean, now sure you're gonna beat me?

29:32.700 --> 29:34.371
- Oh, fuck you up!
- Ya?

29:37.394 --> 29:39.852
Any comments on your
performance today, Mr. Borg?

29:39.853 --> 29:44.430
Well, he played very, very good.
And ah...

29:44.435 --> 29:48.350
I beat him in the end,
but it was not easy. But...

29:48.352 --> 29:50.602
I'm looking forward to the next game.

29:50.603 --> 29:52.799
So, it's up for the new thoughts out there.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.600
It took time to feel the surface,

29:54.650 --> 29:57.161
but then ah... after a while,
I played my tennis.

29:57.394 --> 30:01.461
What's all he's tryin' to do is tryin' to
go on the match and it's been like...

30:01.561 --> 30:04.118
No emotions, not words, just be Borg.

30:04.310 --> 30:06.371
This is impossible.
It is not...

30:06.811 --> 30:09.084
This is not human.
He's like...

30:09.200 --> 30:11.132
- Yo!
- Hey.

30:11.232 --> 30:12.707
Where you guys been,
I've been looking for you?

30:12.731 --> 30:13.976
- Just here.
- How you doin'?

30:13.978 --> 30:16.370
- How ya doin'?
- I'm great.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.885
- Peter.
- Good to see you.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.315
I've got a car waiting for us. Let's go!

30:19.339 --> 30:21.719
- No I got to see Jenny.
- Peter...

30:21.728 --> 30:24.500
- Sorry.
- All right. Here we go.

30:24.686 --> 30:26.601
- Let's go!
- Send my love to Jenny.

30:26.670 --> 30:31.500
Come on, ladies. Let's go.
Let's go, come on, keep up! Come on!

30:34.353 --> 30:36.957
It's like my second home.
I love this place.

30:37.227 --> 30:40.800
Honestly, everybody's so good here.
Good people, you know.

30:40.810 --> 30:44.900
- Hey, man?
- How you doin', man? Good to see you. Hey!

30:45.200 --> 30:47.000
Hey! Hey!

30:47.977 --> 30:52.826
- Yes! It was fuckin' brilliant!
- Almost got my fuckin' head!

30:52.936 --> 30:55.000
Hey, are you watchin' the matches?
Did you watch the Borg matches?

30:55.001 --> 30:57.101
- Ya.
- So you see what I'm seein'?

30:57.103 --> 31:01.800
Did you see him get slower? Very much much
slower? Because it's out of shape.

31:01.894 --> 31:05.300
- You'll understand someday. All right?
- Explain it.

31:05.352 --> 31:09.600
He got 4 Wimbledon titles, all right?
It's a lot of pressure.

31:09.603 --> 31:13.369
You know, everybody wants to beat Björn.
Everybody wants something from Björn.

31:13.561 --> 31:18.540
It makes him the loneliest fuckin'
guy on the planet, you know?

31:19.102 --> 31:20.685
That's good shape.

31:20.686 --> 31:23.935
Look, this is, this is Eve and this Eve.
You know, Brits...

31:23.936 --> 31:25.976
They're beautiful fuckin' ladies,
they wanna meet you,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.900
they wanna hurry with you,
and they fuckin' love you.

31:27.901 --> 31:30.019
John, I can't talk about tennis here.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.500
I mean, look at this tits! Right?
What the fuck, what more do you want, John?

31:35.519 --> 31:36.665
Look, do you want to know

31:36.865 --> 31:38.470
- what Björn is doing right now?
- Yes.

31:38.477 --> 31:41.768
He's in bed. His room is cold-fuck,

31:41.769 --> 31:44.434
because he wants his pulse below
of 50 beats a minute, that's why...

31:44.436 --> 31:45.685
- Rumor.
- It's not.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.393
He got all these superstitions, rituals...

31:47.394 --> 31:49.726
Why cut this shit and just say the stuff
I wanna fuckin' hear.

31:49.727 --> 31:51.977
Look, this year, his parents are
not to come, right?

31:51.978 --> 31:54.226
He only lets them come every second year.

31:54.227 --> 31:57.378
And when they do, they gonna wear the same
clothes throughout the tournament.

31:57.394 --> 31:59.685
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Ya, right? Every year,

31:59.686 --> 32:02.310
he trains on the same court,
he rents the same hotel,

32:02.311 --> 32:05.118
he rents the same car,
he sleeps in the same room...

32:05.394 --> 32:08.143
His coach always brings
50 rackets,

32:08.144 --> 32:11.102
strung as tight as fuck.
And, every night, before the match,

32:11.103 --> 32:13.935
they meet in Lennart's room
goin' on all the rackets,

32:13.936 --> 32:17.038
organizing everything according to
tension and key.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.829
It like a fuckin' religion.

32:20.227 --> 32:23.212
Mariana, his girlfriend,
she takes care of his bag,

32:23.269 --> 32:26.158
same meticulous order, everything exact.

32:26.353 --> 32:27.852
What is that?

32:27.853 --> 32:31.667
When he gets to the arena, takes the
same chair and two towels.

32:32.228 --> 32:35.116
Not one, not three, two!

32:35.686 --> 32:37.911
- And he never treads on the baseline.
- Why?

32:38.311 --> 32:40.121
Because that means bad luck.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.310
They say he's an iceberg,
but, really, he's a volcano

32:43.311 --> 32:45.584
keeping it all in until... boom!

33:32.477 --> 33:34.371
A bit shorter, ha?

33:39.561 --> 33:41.870
That geography test.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.164
What happened there?

33:45.187 --> 33:47.127
I got a 96 out of a hundred.

33:47.812 --> 33:49.704
What about the other 4?

33:50.061 --> 33:52.286
I got the top of my class.

33:54.603 --> 33:56.994
How many kids in your class, John?

33:59.602 --> 34:01.185
30.

34:01.186 --> 34:06.900
In real world, outside of school, is
a lot bigger than 30 people... right?

34:08.186 --> 34:10.245
Tennis making you miss focus?

34:18.768 --> 34:20.496
Oh, come on!

34:21.393 --> 34:23.501
Is someone gonna do
of these pigeons? I mean...

34:23.770 --> 34:25.580
you don't hear that?

34:25.853 --> 34:27.768
On the roof, you don't
hear that? On the roof?

34:27.770 --> 34:29.935
Nothing will be done about any
pigeons during this match, Mr. McEnroe.

34:29.936 --> 34:31.415
Of course not!

34:32.978 --> 34:35.518
The pigeons are ruining my focus,
don't you pity it?

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
I have to ask you to...

34:36.617 --> 34:38.360
- continue playing, Mr. McEnroe.
- Shut up! Shut up!

34:38.385 --> 34:44.500
- Come on, Big Mac!
- Shh!

34:54.145 --> 34:55.835
15-0.

34:59.561 --> 35:02.061
Why don't you light up fireworks
while I'm doing this thing?

35:02.062 --> 35:04.686
Why do not you do that?
Light up fireworks while I'm serving.

35:04.687 --> 35:06.662
Whistle a fuckin' song or something.

35:09.311 --> 35:11.785
- Quiet, please.
- Thank you, thank you.

35:14.478 --> 35:16.621
Come on! Shut the fuck up!

35:16.770 --> 35:18.082
New ball.
Give me another ball.

35:29.769 --> 35:31.580
30-0.

37:55.187 --> 37:57.061
My father will appeal, anyway.

37:57.062 --> 37:59.705
Hey, my congrats that you stay away
from my whole match today, Voss.

37:59.729 --> 38:01.602
Why nab Jimmy, you won.
Come on, give us a smile.

38:01.603 --> 38:03.413
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

38:33.853 --> 38:35.119
0-40.

42:51.270 --> 42:53.814
Said, Arthur,
what must Björn Borg be thinking

42:54.014 --> 42:56.162
after this sensational demonstration?

42:56.270 --> 43:00.961
Well, if McEnroe can maintain his form,
we may very well have a new champion.

49:01.687 --> 49:05.999
The world of tennis has never before
seen anything like this!

49:40.400 --> 49:42.600
- Hey, Björn.
- Hey there.

49:46.563 --> 49:50.800
I love this! Hey, lad, how you doin'?
One bottle of champagne here?

49:50.801 --> 49:51.853
Ya, all right!

49:51.854 --> 49:54.664
Let's get some champagne over here!

53:28.563 --> 53:31.354
I think the drinks are ready.

53:31.355 --> 53:33.877
There you go.

53:34.271 --> 53:36.994
Tom, multiply two numbers.

53:37.396 --> 53:39.207
- Any two numbers?
- Yes.

53:39.479 --> 53:41.207
32 times 14.

53:42.188 --> 53:43.854
448.

53:43.855 --> 53:45.796
Now, now you got to make him sweat.

53:47.938 --> 53:49.914
122 times 46.

53:51.105 --> 53:53.164
5,612.

53:55.563 --> 53:57.290
Okay...

53:58.313 --> 54:03.087
66,322 times 2,198.

54:14.396 --> 54:16.479
You can dance to daddy Harry.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.622
- You're like 57 years old.
- Honestly?

54:18.688 --> 54:21.328
What the hell do you
know about my generation?

54:21.396 --> 54:23.705
- Hey, Pete. How you doing?
- Ya, very excited.

54:24.897 --> 54:27.584
So... it's you and me.

54:30.688 --> 54:32.333
John...

54:33.605 --> 54:35.546
You ready?

54:37.938 --> 54:40.211
- I'll see you at the court.
- See you, John.

54:40.438 --> 54:42.213
Seriously?

54:55.313 --> 54:57.538
Are you still not talking to me?

55:06.230 --> 55:08.538
Where's my ankle support?

55:09.729 --> 55:11.422
What the fuck...

55:17.605 --> 55:19.297
Come on, John.

55:19.980 --> 55:22.833
John give me the ankle support.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.171
John.

55:32.979 --> 55:35.620
Asher: Would you gentlemen
like to come this way?

56:01.980 --> 56:03.494
40-15.

56:05.688 --> 56:09.453
John McEnroe is slaughtering for
that countryman, Peter Fleming.

56:41.688 --> 56:44.044
I didn't take your ankle thing, you know.

56:44.272 --> 56:47.479
I really didn't, Pete.
That's not something I'd do, why?

56:47.480 --> 56:50.251
- Fuck you, John.
- Fuck me, fuck me. Fine, fuck me.

56:50.272 --> 56:52.496
Who cares, fuck me. Fine.

56:53.229 --> 56:56.580
Look, I fucking told you, man.
I fuckin' told you, didn't I?

56:57.438 --> 57:00.327
- Fuck the ankle support, okay?
- Are you done?

57:01.980 --> 57:03.495
Sit down.

57:06.900 --> 57:09.707
Hey, are we good?

57:14.271 --> 57:16.496
I'm goin' to say this once.

57:17.980 --> 57:20.453
You gonna win Wimbledon.

57:21.146 --> 57:24.035
If not this year, then it's
only matter of time.

57:26.564 --> 57:28.671
You can be number one.

57:29.397 --> 57:31.421
- I know it.
- Okay.

57:32.980 --> 57:36.900
You'll never be remembered as
one of the greats. You know why?

57:38.730 --> 57:40.624
John, look at me.

57:43.772 --> 57:46.163
Because nobody likes you.

57:48.355 --> 57:51.671
Not one kid out there wants to play
like Johnny Mac when he grows up.

57:53.897 --> 57:55.541
- Ya?
- Uh hm!

57:58.229 --> 58:01.913
In twenty years, the only thing people
are gonna say is:

58:02.855 --> 58:07.249
"Hey, what was the name of that crazy guy
who always yell at the umpire?"

58:08.063 --> 58:10.585
You fucked up my game,
I'm your friend.

58:20.646 --> 58:23.583
Just say sorry...
Just fucked him!

58:32.313 --> 58:34.207
John McEnroe?

58:37.772 --> 58:39.286
Hi, John.

58:40.064 --> 58:41.838
Hurry.

58:43.063 --> 58:45.354
Has it been we could ask the receptionist
just not to yell at my name like that...

58:45.355 --> 58:47.600
every time I come in here?

58:48.814 --> 58:51.354
- Were you the only one out there?
- Ya, I'm the only one out there.

58:51.355 --> 58:54.021
And it makes me feelin' uncomfortable when
she yells my name out like that.

58:54.022 --> 58:56.063
And I walk in here... edgy.

58:56.064 --> 58:58.187
- Okay, we don't want you edgy.
- Okay.

58:58.188 --> 59:00.229
- We want you to feel comfortable.
- Thank you.

59:00.230 --> 59:01.922
No problem.

59:03.563 --> 59:05.955
John, you mentioned "defensive"...

59:17.146 --> 59:18.922
It's your move, dad.

59:38.105 --> 59:41.900
- How's the back?
- It's the same.

59:45.438 --> 59:48.291
He has already seen a lefty
before you got here.

59:48.397 --> 59:50.397
And I mean its, it's not even
a surprise, you know.

59:53.938 --> 59:55.500
Well, he hasn't seen you.

01:00:03.855 --> 01:00:05.630
We'll win.

01:00:19.605 --> 01:00:21.120
This way, please.

01:00:33.481 --> 01:00:35.421
- Can we touch it?
- Ya.

01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:41.396
We push the button now?
We can get the doubles up before the final.

01:00:41.397 --> 01:00:43.997
Isn't it this a bit simplistic?
Should we see on the side of John?

01:00:44.731 --> 01:00:46.938
What we are seeing right now is unique.

01:00:46.939 --> 01:00:49.146
Tennis players are like rock stars.

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:51.479
The tabloids are having
a field day with him.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.979
But this rivalry between Borg and John
is forcing people to ask themselves:

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.083
"Who am I, the gentleman or the rebel?"

01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:14.371
It's a beautiful morning here at Wimbledon,
for the men's semi-finals.

01:01:16.438 --> 01:01:19.423
Björn Borg is up against the American,
Brian Gottfried.

01:01:20.188 --> 01:01:21.896
And, in the second semi-final,

01:01:21.897 --> 01:01:25.710
a clash between the two most
controversial figure of tennis today.

01:01:25.771 --> 01:01:28.838
John McEnroe and fellow countryman
Jimmy Connors.

01:01:37.272 --> 01:01:39.913
First serve, Wimbledon semi-final.

01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:45.876
0-15.

01:01:58.647 --> 01:02:00.208
15-40.

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.253
Game, second set to Gottfried. One set all.

01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:15.244
Björn Borg is having a tough time
against Gottfried, unexpectedly tough.

01:02:19.438 --> 01:02:22.286
Listen to those jeers.
I can't remember a single

01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:26.000
Wimbledon match where the crowd
has made this much noise.

01:02:31.355 --> 01:02:32.787
Out.

01:02:35.105 --> 01:02:37.046
- Out.
- What?!

01:02:37.813 --> 01:02:39.480
Excuse me?

01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:41.270
It wasn't on the side of the line,
Mr. McEnroe.

01:02:41.294 --> 01:02:42.521
How both... the track blew up!

01:02:42.522 --> 01:02:44.813
- The ball has been ruled out.
- Excuse me?

01:02:44.814 --> 01:02:47.062
It was good call. It was a bit
of a scramble.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.480
You can't be serious!
You can not be serious!

01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:52.962
The ball is on the line!
Chalk flew up all over, man!

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.560
The chalk blew up!
He saw, that's why he walks all over!

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.979
Everyone saw that was in!

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.411
You can not possibly call that out.

01:02:58.438 --> 01:03:02.252
I'm goin' to issue you a warning for
unsportsmanlike behavior, Mr. McEnroe.

01:03:07.147 --> 01:03:09.021
Borg isn't playing any great tennis,

01:03:09.022 --> 01:03:11.687
but it's enough to beat the unseeded
American, Gottfried.

01:03:11.688 --> 01:03:13.438
Björn, congratulations
on reaching the finals.

01:03:13.439 --> 01:03:15.896
So, side there, Jimmy Connors or
John McEnroe that awaits you now.

01:03:15.897 --> 01:03:18.538
How do you respond to McEnroe's comment
from before the tournament:

01:03:18.814 --> 01:03:21.418
"That Borg, the machine,
will soon break down?"

01:03:23.397 --> 01:03:26.500
I'm just like anybody else,
I'm not a machine.

01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:31.354
You guys are the pits of the world.

01:03:31.355 --> 01:03:33.047
You keep your mouth shut up.

01:03:33.106 --> 01:03:34.979
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Why won't you stay on your side?

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.979
- No one's talking to you.
- I'm talking to you.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.839
Shut the fuck up! Nobody's talking to you.

01:03:39.856 --> 01:03:41.370
You fucking asshole!

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.063
I'm so fucking disgusted,
I'd go home now!

01:03:44.064 --> 01:03:44.954
Play some tennis!

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.332
Shut the fuck up!
Go play tennis by yourself!

01:03:49.106 --> 01:03:51.165
John, congratulations
on your victory today.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.604
Ah, what do you have to say about
your behavior?

01:03:53.605 --> 01:03:55.188
Can we talk about my tennis?

01:03:55.189 --> 01:03:57.313
You worried about the reputation
you've gained over here.

01:03:57.314 --> 01:03:59.605
People are talking more about your
behavior than on your tennis.

01:03:59.606 --> 01:04:01.623
No, you certainly talked more about
my behavior than my tennis.

01:04:01.647 --> 01:04:03.229
- But do you think it's valid?
- No.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.230
But do you have any regrets
about your behavior?

01:04:06.231 --> 01:04:09.522
I mean, I regret I gonna see you and
talk to you, that's all I regret.

01:04:09.523 --> 01:04:12.624
Do you expect anyone to rope you
in the final against Borg?

01:04:12.647 --> 01:04:15.879
Look, I get it, ah, you guys you're hero?

01:04:16.272 --> 01:04:18.396
You know, your gentleman Borg
and you need a villain...

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:19.512
Do you think you'll be
able to keep your temper?

01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:20.438
Let's talk about tennis.

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:21.979
Does anybody have any tennis questions?

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.062
Do you enjoy being a villain?
You think that it helps you...

01:04:24.063 --> 01:04:25.586
Do you think you'll be
able to keep your temper?

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:26.813
Why won't you shut the fuck up, man?

01:04:26.814 --> 01:04:28.980
- Are you watching the matches?
- Yes, I'm watchin' the matches.

01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:31.668
Do you not understand what the fuck
it takes to play tennis?

01:04:32.856 --> 01:04:35.460
You know I go up there, I give
everything for this game.

01:04:35.481 --> 01:04:38.396
Everything! Everything you need is
left out in this fucking court,

01:04:38.397 --> 01:04:41.285
and none of you understand,
because none of you do it!

01:05:15.439 --> 01:05:17.355
How's the flight?
You look great.

01:05:17.356 --> 01:05:18.938
This is a group from Argentina.

01:05:22.064 --> 01:05:23.294
Björn.

01:05:58.398 --> 01:06:01.085
I can't remember which door.

01:06:01.147 --> 01:06:03.188
Can't you just pick one?
They all look alike.

01:06:03.189 --> 01:06:05.746
No. It has to be,
it has to be the right one.

01:06:08.856 --> 01:06:11.229
Wait, wait, please.
Wait with the camera.

01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:13.063
Björn, I don't think it's
all that important.

01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:14.923
It's very important!

01:09:25.356 --> 01:09:26.917
That.

01:10:44.356 --> 01:10:46.022
Five minutes, gentlemen.

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.522
- Turn down the volume on McEnroe mic.
- What? But they switch sides all the time.

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:08.499
That's an order from the top.

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:15.300
It is the perfect rivalry,
the baseline player and the net rusher.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.855
Ice-Borg against Super-brat.

01:11:21.856 --> 01:11:26.188
15 thousand spectators, hundreds
of millions at home by their TVs.

01:11:33.106 --> 01:11:34.751
Gentlemen...

01:11:45.815 --> 01:11:47.625
The first out is McEnroe.

01:11:48.106 --> 01:11:50.063
The crowd is booing him.

01:11:50.064 --> 01:11:52.290
That's the first in Wimbledon final.

01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:04.543
There he is, Björn Borg, the Emperor!

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:07.041
This court belongs to him!

01:12:16.273 --> 01:12:18.189
The final we've all been waiting for.

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:22.688
Borg, a legend in his own lifetime,
Tremendous pressure on him today.

01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:26.918
He's won it 4 times. The fifth time,
I'm sure would be even harder.

01:12:28.398 --> 01:12:31.000
Quiet please, quiet please!

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:34.122
McEnroe to serve. Ready?

01:12:35.314 --> 01:12:36.746
Play!

01:12:44.648 --> 01:12:46.105
15-0.

01:12:46.106 --> 01:12:48.794
And there's the talent in McEnroe
in the opening point.

01:13:06.565 --> 01:13:08.291
40-0.

01:13:11.148 --> 01:13:13.669
And there's Borg's
blistering return of serve.

01:13:14.148 --> 01:13:15.709
40-15.

01:13:19.356 --> 01:13:20.813
Game, McEnroe.

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:23.147
The first game of the
match goes to McEnroe.

01:13:23.148 --> 01:13:26.001
McEnroe's serve and volley
decides the first game.

01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:44.704
Out.

01:13:44.814 --> 01:13:46.460
McEnroe takes the game!

01:13:48.273 --> 01:13:51.079
What a fantastic start
for McEnroe!

01:13:51.815 --> 01:13:53.590
McEnroe to serve.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:05.501
Game, McEnroe.

01:14:07.273 --> 01:14:10.624
Borg really having difficulty with
McEnroe's left-handed serve.

01:14:11.856 --> 01:14:14.081
Like trying to catch hummingbirds.

01:14:15.023 --> 01:14:16.856
Borg looks shell-shocked.

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:20.539
McEnroe is humiliating Borg
and he's making look slow.

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:40.922
Game and first set to McEnroe, 6-1.

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:44.922
Björn Borg is in trouble.
Trouble in Sweden.

01:14:58.898 --> 01:15:00.625
New balls, please.

01:15:03.106 --> 01:15:04.586
Time.

01:15:09.523 --> 01:15:11.298
Second set, Borg to serve.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.600
- Come on, Björn!
- Quiet, please.

01:15:24.314 --> 01:15:26.338
Unbelievable serve!

01:15:38.023 --> 01:15:39.715
That's the Borg we know.

01:15:50.148 --> 01:15:51.397
Out!

01:15:51.398 --> 01:15:52.855
Game to Borg.

01:15:52.856 --> 01:15:56.172
We've seen a completely
different Borg in the second set.

01:16:06.815 --> 01:16:10.463
Oh, there it is! Björn Borg
takes himself to set point.

01:16:26.232 --> 01:16:27.800
Fuck!

01:16:30.523 --> 01:16:34.123
Game and second set to Borg, 7-5.

01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:48.831
This is exactly what Björn Borg wants!

01:16:57.023 --> 01:17:00.457
And McEnroe seems out of touch.

01:17:05.357 --> 01:17:08.731
It's a big momentum racer when you
come from behind like Borg has done

01:17:08.732 --> 01:17:11.502
and it tends to undermine
your opponent's confidence.

01:17:16.981 --> 01:17:18.673
40-15.

01:17:18.732 --> 01:17:21.419
So that's for two set points.

01:17:25.357 --> 01:17:27.499
Game and third set to Borg.

01:17:27.982 --> 01:17:31.712
And there it is, Björn Borg wins
the third set and he leads, 2 sets to 1.

01:18:10.274 --> 01:18:12.961
So, it's going to be a four set now.

01:18:13.273 --> 01:18:17.230
If Borg wins it, he can call himself
5-time Wimbledon champion.

01:18:30.774 --> 01:18:32.100
Fault!

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:35.064
Fault, fault. I thought it was good.
McEnroe thought it was good.

01:18:35.065 --> 01:18:36.461
30-40.

01:18:37.524 --> 01:18:38.773
Fuck!

01:18:38.774 --> 01:18:40.370
Second double-fault.

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:52.586
Out!

01:19:11.149 --> 01:19:12.628
Out!

01:19:13.398 --> 01:19:15.837
I believe the umpire's wrong
about that call.

01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:18.504
How will McEnroe react to this?

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.787
30-15.

01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:27.044
Let's go, John!

01:19:37.065 --> 01:19:38.580
Time.

01:19:39.481 --> 01:19:43.100
It's all right, it's a great match.
Just play your tennis.

01:19:50.315 --> 01:19:52.256
Ace, McEnroe!

01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:59.955
McEnroe is getting stronger,
as the set goes on.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:07.800
McEnroe has the game of 3-2
lead in the fourth set.

01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:15.606
Come on, John!

01:20:15.607 --> 01:20:18.294
The pressure is now all on the Swede.

01:20:28.482 --> 01:20:30.079
Game for Borg.

01:20:30.482 --> 01:20:32.079
He has the game, 5 all!

01:20:42.066 --> 01:20:45.298
What a return and Björn
Borg is in the lead.

01:20:50.899 --> 01:20:52.413
An ace for Borg.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:55.086
You can almost taste the Championship now.

01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:03.458
So here it is, Championship point for Borg!
Two of them.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.080
Quiet please.

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:35.582
Quiet please. Second serve.

01:21:47.857 --> 01:21:49.916
It saves the first match point.

01:21:53.482 --> 01:21:55.731
Second championship point for Borg.

01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:17.998
Borg's gotta try not to think
about those lost match points now.

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:26.756
- McEnroe!
- Break point for John McEnroe.

01:22:28.357 --> 01:22:31.648
Quiet please!

01:22:31.649 --> 01:22:33.189
So what a moment this is for Borg.

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:36.079
He stance to serve, having
lost two match points.

01:22:36.357 --> 01:22:40.123
McEnroe is back in the match,
now with a chance to make it even.

01:22:47.274 --> 01:22:52.350
John McEnroe has notched to the
way from Borg! Just like that!

01:22:52.357 --> 01:22:55.626
6 games all, tiebreak!
Now comes in to operate.

01:22:56.357 --> 01:22:58.500
No men's final has ever
ended in a tiebreak.

01:23:16.232 --> 01:23:20.106
Björn Borg has taken himself to
another championship point.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.800
Oh, McEnroe sets nose to rise again.
What determination!

01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:45.314
And there's the greatness of the man!

01:23:45.315 --> 01:23:48.600
Just one fleeting opportunity
and he's through like a ravian!

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.832
Championship point number four.

01:23:52.065 --> 01:23:54.500
Oh, John McEnroe!

01:23:54.815 --> 01:23:57.900
He has reached 4 match points
from Björn Borg!

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.940
And now, McEnroe has the chance to
turn this whole thing upside down.

01:24:10.941 --> 01:24:12.231
Ball.

01:24:33.441 --> 01:24:36.231
If why a man would take anymore
punishment...

01:24:36.232 --> 01:24:39.501
If this were a heavyweight boxing match,
they'd stop the fight.

01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:51.631
If Borg wins this point, the brute
would blow off the Center Court.

01:24:52.608 --> 01:24:54.999
- Come on, Björn!
- Quiet please!

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.898
No!
- - McEnroe!

01:25:00.899 --> 01:25:03.898
Borg has been so close,
but McEnroe just won't give in.

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:07.168
Those men have looked down the barrel
of a gun, and the two are still alive.

01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:12.123
In ending I've never seen
a tie-break like this.

01:25:28.358 --> 01:25:30.417
Set point for McEnroe.

01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:36.252
He's got it!

01:25:36.316 --> 01:25:38.919
No! The linesman rules it's out.

01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:41.210
15 all.

01:26:02.607 --> 01:26:03.939
Yes!

01:26:28.524 --> 01:26:29.731
Yes!

01:26:29.732 --> 01:26:31.247
It's dead even!

01:26:31.274 --> 01:26:32.690
Come on!

01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:36.954
Incredible! McEnroe wins
the tie-break, 18-16.

01:26:38.024 --> 01:26:41.423
Björn Borg has lost 7 match points.

01:27:18.107 --> 01:27:20.273
And what must Borg be thinking?

01:27:20.274 --> 01:27:23.148
That elusive fifth Championship
almost within his reach,

01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:25.623
but stolen from him seven times.

01:28:53.191 --> 01:28:55.731
This is nothing short of unbelievable!

01:28:55.732 --> 01:28:57.482
No one can become him

01:28:57.483 --> 01:29:00.335
after losing 7 match points to
the Wimbledon final.

01:29:00.357 --> 01:29:02.713
But, Borg, is playing
like nothing happened.

01:29:12.899 --> 01:29:15.338
And now, it's all about heart.

01:29:15.566 --> 01:29:18.455
Hearts beating on either side of the net.

01:29:19.108 --> 01:29:22.755
They can hit the ball,
it's up to the hearts.

01:31:00.650 --> 01:31:03.882
Once again, match point for Borg.

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.292
Five times in a row!

01:31:55.858 --> 01:31:58.167
Game set and Championship for Borg!

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:17.797
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
runner-up of Wimbledon 1980...

01:33:18.066 --> 01:33:20.125
John Patrick McEnroe.

01:33:28.733 --> 01:33:30.232
Here he comes...

01:33:30.233 --> 01:33:32.458
standing ovation for McEnroe,

01:33:32.566 --> 01:33:35.550
whose behavior today was beyond reproach.

01:33:36.317 --> 01:33:39.999
John Patrick McEnroe is not
the champion today,

01:33:40.317 --> 01:33:44.165
but he has finally won the hearts of
Great Britain.

01:33:45.399 --> 01:33:49.083
And for King of the Tennis world,
without a doubt.

01:33:54.317 --> 01:33:55.878
- Well played.
- Thank you.

01:34:00.024 --> 01:34:01.372
Thanks.

01:34:02.649 --> 01:34:04.129
Thank you.

01:34:04.649 --> 01:34:05.729
Thank you.

01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:57.844
Shit...

01:36:59.248 --> 01:37:00.623
Fuck...

01:37:06.567 --> 01:37:07.879
Greeting.

01:37:08.567 --> 01:37:10.607
John: Congratulations. Bjorn: Thank you.
John: Yeah.

01:37:11.691 --> 01:37:14.290
John: Good game. Bjorn: Yeah.

01:37:15.317 --> 01:37:17.175
I thought you had me.

01:37:17.525 --> 01:37:19.779
John: Almost. Bjorn: Yeah.

01:37:20.608 --> 01:37:22.205
Have a nice year.

01:37:25.317 --> 01:37:27.257
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks, haha.

01:37:29.483 --> 01:37:31.922
You hug people or so? Come on!

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.304
John: All right, man.
Bjorn: Safe trip.
