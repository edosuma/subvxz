00:00.630 --> 00:02.780
We got a special treat today radio listeners

We're talking with international pop sensation:

00:04.980 --> 00:07.970
the glamorous Hannah Montana!

00:10.210 --> 00:12.440
So Hannah, where did we track you down?

00:12.500 --> 00:15.170
I'm guessing some place fabulous and exciting

00:15.860 --> 00:19.150
Yeah, I mean, if you could only see me now.

00:19.330 --> 00:23.020
I'm actually eating at a beautiful cafe in ...

00:23.390 --> 00:24.390
In Italy.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.790
Wow, where in Italy?

00:31.810 --> 00:36.900
Uh...in a great little town called sodium free

00:38.030 --> 00:40.410
I mean Sodiana Fremin

00:41.280 --> 00:44.900
College man in the house!

00:45.070 --> 00:48.290
Hello, can't you see I'm in the middle of doing an interview?

00:48.300 --> 00:51.130
Hello, in the middle of not caring.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.270
Dad, I can't believe I was

00:53.270 --> 00:55.640
so down on going to Malibu Community College

00:55.670 --> 00:57.080
It's gonna be amazing.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.330
That is a great attitude son!

00:59.380 --> 01:01.050
Now let's see those text books.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.990
Right, about that...

01:04.080 --> 01:06.450
You know MCC's about more than just books dad it's...

01:06.500 --> 01:08.120
It's about broadening your horizons with,

01:08.120 --> 01:10.240
in new places and with new people.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.020
Well do all the new people there

01:12.020 --> 01:14.240
wear hats with crab claws on 'em?

01:14.660 --> 01:17.140
Just the ones with school spirit.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.280
We are the sand crabs, the mighty fighting sand crabs!

01:21.290 --> 01:22.700
Shhhhh!

01:22.830 --> 01:26.530
Big house, many rooms, go find one!

01:28.320 --> 01:30.950
Big bag, no books, where are they?

01:31.570 --> 01:34.130
What, there was a crazy line for books, so...

01:34.130 --> 01:35.870
I made an educated decision to

01:35.870 --> 01:38.660
spend my first day in college a little more wisely.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.910
Translation:

01:40.050 --> 01:43.960
The girl selling these sand crab doodads was cute and

01:44.000 --> 01:46.310
you decided to broaden your horizons with her.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.160
Dad, please, she's got a name:

01:49.370 --> 01:52.600
Cashier number 88675309.

01:53.740 --> 01:57.910
Hey hey, get your crabby claws off of my garlic bread!

01:58.650 --> 02:01.260
Ooh, trouble in Sodiana Flemmi

02:01.550 --> 02:03.880
Oh no, it's just my crabby brother and his...

02:03.880 --> 02:05.570
fungus filled feet.

02:06.070 --> 02:07.760
Zip it brat, that's personal!

02:07.790 --> 02:09.820
-Oh yeah sure now you're whisper!  -Oh now you're whisper

02:11.320 --> 02:12.870
Hey, who knew Hannah had a brother,

02:12.870 --> 02:14.490
how old is he? 9, 10?

02:14.580 --> 02:17.250
Oh yeah, I wish he acted that mature.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.670
Dad!

02:21.680 --> 02:22.430
How about that?

02:22.440 --> 02:24.700
Even pop stars have brothers they're embarrassed by.

02:24.950 --> 02:25.730
Tell me about it.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.280
You have not lived until you've seen him pick the lint

02:28.280 --> 02:30.570
out of his navel, sniff it and then put it back.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.770
No that's not true, I don't always put it back.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.560
You hear that, girls,

02:35.560 --> 02:38.780
if you're looking for a lint sniffing stinky feet goof,

02:38.780 --> 02:41.160
Hannah Montana's brother is your man.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.250
You back off,

02:43.250 --> 02:45.350
and you, take back what you said about your brother.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.290
Fine.

02:48.290 --> 02:49.730
Listen about my brother...

02:49.740 --> 02:51.200
That's about all we have time for today,

02:51.200 --> 02:52.660
enjoy Italy Hannah.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.810
Oh I will, ciao.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.140
Well I tried.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.390
Thanks a lot,

02:59.390 --> 03:03.050
you just made me sound like a
 total loser on national radio.

03:03.100 --> 03:03.430
Oh relax,

03:03.430 --> 03:05.890
nobody knows that Jackson Stewart is Hannah's brother.

03:05.930 --> 03:08.500
Except for the entire town of Crowley Corners.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.000
there's tons of girls who now think I'm a total loser!

03:11.010 --> 03:11.890
If they already know you

03:11.890 --> 03:13.330
they already know that you're a total loser.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.450
No harm no foul.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.740
Oh, there has been harm.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.010
And to be fair, there will be foul.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.850
Play, from me to you.

03:22.650 --> 03:26.400
You just messed with the wrong fighting sand crab missy.

03:26.630 --> 03:30.640
We are the sand crabs, the mighty 
fighting sand crabs, yeah!

Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

03:52.100 --> 03:56.120
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.720
Who would've thought that a girl like me

03:59.970 --> 04:05.400
Would double as a superstar?

04:06.140 --> 04:09.970
You get the best of both worlds.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.990
Chill it out, take it slow,

04:12.100 --> 04:13.870
then you rock out the show.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.880
You get the best of both worlds.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.750
Mix it all together and you know that

04:20.760 --> 04:23.570
It's the best of both worlds.

04:23.850 --> 04:27.340
Hannah Montana  S03E21  For (Give) a Little Bit

04:34.140 --> 04:37.920
Week old shrimp, perfect.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.540
Ah, revenge is a dish best served stinky.

04:43.690 --> 04:46.090
-Jackson?  
-Nothing, what week old shrimp?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.480
Hand it over, son.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.390
Come on dad, you heard what she said about me?

04:50.810 --> 04:53.230
Can I just pour some in her pockets?

04:53.300 --> 04:54.730
-Jackson  
-In her shoes?

04:54.780 --> 04:56.560
-Jackson 
 -Fine.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.490
Oh, would you look at that?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.240
you know she only sucks her thumb

05:02.240 --> 05:04.160
when she feels guilty about something.

05:04.650 --> 05:06.640
That doesn't mean she feels guilty about me.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.140
Jackson, sorry...

05:10.900 --> 05:12.060
Doesn't prove anything.

05:12.940 --> 05:17.260
Look at that face, it's like tryna stay mad at a kitten.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.180
No! no no no, that's not gonna work on me this time.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.250
I just gonna look away, look away.

05:32.690 --> 05:34.460
Mmmh, what's that smell?

05:34.520 --> 05:37.560
Revenge! It would've been all over you if a certain

05:37.560 --> 05:39.370
shrimp-stealing-sister-saver hadn't

05:39.370 --> 05:40.960
stepped in and stopped me!

05:42.300 --> 05:45.670
Jackson look, this is really hard for me to say.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.100
Harder than "shrimp-stealing-sister-saver"? I doubt it!

05:49.690 --> 05:50.770
shrimp-stealing-sister-saver,

05:50.770 --> 05:52.240
shrimp-stealing-sister-saver, shrimp...

05:52.280 --> 05:53.830
Oh sweet niblets son this is hard to say.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.540
Jackson please.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.560
Go ahead.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.070
I shouldn't have said that stuff about you on the radio.

06:06.410 --> 06:07.740
I was just tryna be funny

06:07.740 --> 06:09.450
and I'm sorry that I embarrassed you.

06:14.930 --> 06:16.840
OK, fine, I forgive you.

06:17.180 --> 06:18.830
No no no, I have a condition.

06:19.190 --> 06:20.630
You know your Hannah friend Traci,

06:20.640 --> 06:22.740
She's throwing one of those 
pretty people partis tonight,

06:22.740 --> 06:23.790
and you have to take me with you.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.280
But you don't even like Traci.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.660
True, but she throws great parties with free food.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.520
Giving me a cheap way to take 
out the girl of my dreams.

06:30.570 --> 06:32.970
Cashier number: 88675309.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.430
Oh come on, can't you just, can't you just

06:35.430 --> 06:37.340
pour some shrimp in my hair and let's call it even.

06:37.350 --> 06:38.830
-Yes? 
 -No.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.060
Party.

06:40.370 --> 06:41.710
Oh are you sure about the shrimp?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.030
-Yeah.  -Fine.

06:46.630 --> 06:49.210
Sorry mom, I can't really talk to you right now.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.300
I'm about to use that aerobic stepper you got me.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.320
Oh heck yeah I use it everyday.

06:53.410 --> 06:56.870
You wouldn't believe the things it's done for me.

06:57.130 --> 06:59.490
OK, I'll call you later, bye bye.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.610
And here we go.

07:06.500 --> 07:11.500
And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, ha!

07:11.880 --> 07:14.980
There you are, you little double-fudge delight.

07:15.950 --> 07:16.970
Hey-yo!

07:19.120 --> 07:20.990
What cookies, where?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.730
Rico, what are you doing here?

07:23.020 --> 07:25.330
Just hoping I can get an autograph on this

07:25.340 --> 07:29.600
vintage Robbie Ray album, I 
happily overpaid for because...

07:29.700 --> 07:33.720
It's more than just music, it's a
piece of American history.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.170
That's a very pretty speech son, but...

07:38.500 --> 07:40.410
We both know you hate country music.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.300
What would make you say such a terrible thing?

07:43.830 --> 07:46.730
Maybe becasue last week you yelled out:

07:46.730 --> 07:48.490
"Hey Robbie, I hate country music!"

07:49.590 --> 07:54.070
Oh shucks partner, ya'll know I was just funning ya.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.070
Alright fine.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.560
I met this gorgeous beach babe

07:59.560 --> 08:00.800
and she's perfect.

08:01.430 --> 08:03.720
Except for one tragic character flaw.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.590
She likes country music, doesn't she?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.650
Loves it!

08:07.490 --> 08:09.340
She even has a dog named Banjo

08:09.640 --> 08:11.390
Oh I had a dog named Banjo!

08:12.500 --> 08:14.120
Surprise, surprise.

08:15.790 --> 08:20.040
The point is, I may have given her the impression that...

08:20.270 --> 08:22.770
I'm a... pretty good line dancer.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
-How good?  -World champion.

08:25.690 --> 08:27.360
Woo, sounds like you're in more trouble

08:27.360 --> 08:30.680
than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.370
You gotta help me, please.

08:33.510 --> 08:37.270
I'm begging you, beg, beg, beg, beg, beg!

08:37.330 --> 08:39.789
It's OK Rico, I'll do it

08:39.789 --> 08:41.720
you don't have to embarrassed yourself in front of me.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.080
-Really?  -Oh heck no.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.650
You have to embarrassed yourself
 in front of the whole beach.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.380
Come on now let's hear it.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.880
Yee doggies, I sure do love that darn coutry music!

09:06.280 --> 09:09.180
You know, Traci's parties are great except for one thing:

09:09.190 --> 09:10.280
Let me guess: Traci.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.720
Yeah, she's always there, why is that?

09:21.530 --> 09:23.400
Yeah, good luck with that.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.630
-Hannah!  
-Traci!

09:27.520 --> 09:29.140
Woo! This place looks incredible.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.870
Welcome to my "day in the life of me" party.

09:32.920 --> 09:38.470
Featuring all the important things 
I do to make this possible.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.460
Over there we have facials.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.730
Or what I like to call: Tra-cials.

09:45.570 --> 09:48.260
And on that side: Tra-ssages.

09:48.460 --> 09:52.820
And of course Tra-nicures and Tra-dicures

09:52.840 --> 09:54.420
You know, after all this stuff

09:54.420 --> 09:56.190
you'd think you'll be less Tra-gly.

09:56.200 --> 09:56.950
Lola!

09:57.830 --> 10:00.900
You know what, I happen to think it's a great idea, and...

10:01.020 --> 10:05.430
I have ingrown Tra-nail, and a nasty Tra-mple,

10:05.550 --> 10:07.240
I need Tra-ken care of!

10:07.670 --> 10:11.580
Hannah, it's a bit, let's not work it to death.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.900
Hannah, this is perfect.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.790
Not only did I just get my nose hairs trimmed, see?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.310
-Nice. 
 -No I see a little boogie back there.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.680
No, that's just his brain.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.610
You are adorable.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.280
Anyway, Mia

10:28.340 --> 10:31.990
Or as you might remember 
her cashier number 88675309.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.550
She is totally loving me for bringing her to this party.

10:35.970 --> 10:38.620
I think she might be my first college girlfriend.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.010
Wave and smile.

10:44.090 --> 10:45.570
I'm getting a little nervous.

10:51.260 --> 10:52.400
Do you think she'll notice?

10:53.540 --> 10:55.110
You'll be fine, if she had a sense of smell

10:55.110 --> 10:56.830
she wouldn't go out with you in the first place.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.500
Good point.

10:59.350 --> 11:02.300
Well, you know he's totally forgiven you for the radio thing.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.310
Yeah well I apologized and he knew I really meant it.

11:05.570 --> 11:06.930
Thumb sucking in your sleep again?

11:07.010 --> 11:09.620
Never been awake to see it but apparently it's irresistible.

11:11.920 --> 11:16.150
Ah, these reflex massages are the best.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.340
All your emotions are tied to the pressure points

11:18.340 --> 11:19.630
in your feet you know.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.440
Oh come on Traci, you don't really believe that, do you?

11:30.850 --> 11:33.210
I love you!

11:33.210 --> 11:35.090
Sorry, that's my feet talking.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.240
Maybe your feet, my feet are pamess-ed,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.630
polished and ready to pounce, meow!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.750
Lola, you've gotta try this,

11:45.750 --> 11:47.690
all your emotions are tied into your...

11:49.410 --> 11:50.930
Alright, what did you just hit there?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.670
Yeah, looks like fun

11:53.670 --> 11:55.870
but they just called my number for the spray tan.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.950
Goodbye pan and pasty, hello tan and tasty.

12:01.940 --> 12:05.790
Hey Hannah, I heard "thumb-thing"
 interesting about you.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.950
What are you talking about?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.300
Check it out, you're all over the internet.

12:09.580 --> 12:12.120
Insider says: Hannah still sucks thumb?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.450
Wow, somebody really had it in for you.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.900
Jackson!!

12:28.730 --> 12:30.880
Alright, where is that stinky-pitted,

12:30.880 --> 12:32.640
back-stabbing, blabbermouth?

12:33.290 --> 12:35.910
Yo, 8867 whatever!

12:36.100 --> 12:37.220
Where's Jackson?

12:37.520 --> 12:40.460
-Getting a facial.  
-Thanks.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.580
Hey Hannah.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.360
Oh, that's funny.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.800
She says she wants it harder.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.970
Eh, Gina, it's time for your break.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.850
Hello, Traci, not done here.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.240
Oh don't worry,

13:05.240 --> 13:09.550
Helga will give you a facial you'll never forget.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.230
Sucker.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.530
What's funny? What...what's funny?

13:35.540 --> 13:38.150
What? What?

13:40.100 --> 13:42.280
What?

13:43.260 --> 13:46.880
Oh what the? No no, this isn't mine, it's...

13:47.460 --> 13:49.070
No my boogers aren't this sticky.

13:56.380 --> 13:57.220
Look at that.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.310
See I knew he had a boogie!

13:59.600 --> 14:01.270
No that's just a little mixture of gum,

14:01.270 --> 14:04.170
cucumber, and a whole lot of wig stick gum.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.370
Bonus I did not see that coming.

14:16.820 --> 14:20.940
I will never date another freshman ever!!

14:22.870 --> 14:23.760
Wait!

14:27.580 --> 14:30.660
That is embarrassing, just a little bit.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.100
Mia, come back!

14:39.270 --> 14:41.050
That's my car...

14:42.670 --> 14:43.570
Gotcha!

14:43.630 --> 14:45.830
Or should I say: snortcha?

14:46.350 --> 14:48.400
You did this? Why?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.660
Oh please, don't try to act innocent.

14:50.860 --> 14:52.450
You told someone about this

14:52.560 --> 14:54.610
And now it's all over the internet.

14:55.530 --> 14:56.870
You crossed the line!

14:56.930 --> 14:59.030
No I didn't! I didn't tell anybody!

14:59.040 --> 15:00.550
Oh please, who would?

15:01.870 --> 15:02.710
Oopsie!

15:05.730 --> 15:07.500
I was talking with Traci and her people

15:07.510 --> 15:09.280
She said "I am Hannah's best freind"

15:09.290 --> 15:09.610
And I said

15:09.610 --> 15:11.490
"Oh I don't think so, I'm Hannah's best friend."

15:11.490 --> 15:13.650
And she was like "You wish" And I was like "You wish"

15:13.660 --> 15:15.720
And she was like "I know best friend stuff about her"

15:15.850 --> 15:17.560
And I was like "I know way better best friend stuff about her

15:17.560 --> 15:18.740
like she still sucks her thumb"

15:18.750 --> 15:20.120
And I know it was wrong but I was talking too fast

15:20.120 --> 15:22.770
so I'll stop right now... done, stop, sorry!

15:26.500 --> 15:27.550
Oopsie?

15:28.100 --> 15:29.410
It's a little late for that!

15:29.650 --> 15:32.240
-Jackson please wait!  -I don't wanna hear it!

15:32.390 --> 15:34.810
Jackson, come back!

15:37.890 --> 15:39.700
That's my car...

15:44.280 --> 15:46.770
OK, partner, it's time to put a little scoot in your boots

15:46.770 --> 15:48.550
and a little glide in your stride,

15:48.550 --> 15:51.500
with a little thing we'd like to call electric slide.

15:51.580 --> 15:52.460
Watch and learn.

15:53.510 --> 15:56.760
Two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

15:56.910 --> 15:58.810
One, two, three, clap.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.070
One, two, three, clap.

16:01.200 --> 16:05.230
And clap, and back, and start again.

16:05.460 --> 16:06.450
Now you do it.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.410
-That's it?  -Yeah, that's it.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.400
I yee doggy the whole beach for this?

16:17.580 --> 16:19.510
Ridiculously easy.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.800
Yeah, and totally wrong.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.460
I mean, a good old boy ain't gonna

16:24.460 --> 16:27.680
be doing all this kind of stuff, 
you know what I'm saying?

16:27.700 --> 16:31.060
Your girl's looking for a championship line dancer,

16:31.070 --> 16:33.030
Not a spin cycle on a washing machine.

16:34.090 --> 16:35.750
Now do it one more time.

16:36.530 --> 16:38.330
And not do all the extra-curricular.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.680
Just do it.

16:42.380 --> 16:48.300
And one, two, three, stop and clap and back and...

16:51.270 --> 16:54.500
Oh it's no use, I can't stop myself.

16:54.660 --> 16:57.330
My mind says no, but my hips say go.

16:58.690 --> 17:01.620
Curse the fire that flew through my latin veins.

17:02.330 --> 17:04.119
Now chill out El Flago.

17:04.430 --> 17:06.589
You just gotta get in touch with your inner cowboy.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.170
I know just the thing to do.

17:12.920 --> 17:14.560
Buckle up and ride

17:18.890 --> 17:20.119
Come on Mr Stewart,

17:20.119 --> 17:22.140
I've been on this thing for three hours

17:22.140 --> 17:24.690
I can't feel my inner cowboy,

17:24.690 --> 17:26.510
or my inner thighs!

17:26.770 --> 17:28.410
Well hop on down and let's see what we've got.

17:31.670 --> 17:34.840
What I've got is a busted back and butt blisters.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.370
Perfect.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.640
What do you mean "perfect"?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.560
Look at you, you're finally walking like a real cowboy.

17:49.910 --> 17:51.860
Now let's see if you can dance like one?

18:06.610 --> 18:09.220
Slide 'em cowboy, slide em!

18:14.850 --> 18:15.980
Come on Jackson,

18:15.980 --> 18:18.120
I've been saying I'm sorry for like past 16 hours.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.460
What more do you want me to do?

18:20.620 --> 18:21.970
OK OK fine.

18:23.030 --> 18:25.570
I humiliated you in front of a girl you like.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.270
And so, you want me to do the same thing?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.700
Alright, you see that really hot guy over there?

18:31.020 --> 18:32.120
He just transfered here,

18:32.120 --> 18:34.690
and all the girls are crazy about him, include me.

18:35.050 --> 18:39.530
I'm about to creat a very sad entry in my diary.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.820
And all for you!

18:42.860 --> 18:45.370
Hey Drew, hey guys.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.650
Hey Miley.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.620
Do you mind if I have a chilli fried?

18:48.630 --> 18:51.380
Ah, you don't want these, they've 
been here since we sat down.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.600
But, I can go get us.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.340
Oh no, don't worry about it.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.950
That's so good, free,

18:59.970 --> 19:02.130
And I did not even mess up my nails.

19:02.130 --> 19:03.780
Oh that's gross!

19:04.100 --> 19:08.670
Oh what? You're afraid of 
somebody who eat used food?

19:08.820 --> 19:12.530
But you know what? I'm a
 cheap date that is your loss.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.890
Sorry, I gotta go!

19:18.080 --> 19:19.730
Are you happy now?

19:20.830 --> 19:23.200
Drew is never gonna talk to me again.

19:23.270 --> 19:24.290
So we're even, right?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.580
Alright fine, you want me to

19:27.580 --> 19:30.180
humiliate myself in front of the entire beach?

19:30.300 --> 19:33.060
I'll do it, but you just remember this is all for you!

19:39.190 --> 19:42.110
If that won't put a hole in the 
ozone I don't know what will.

19:48.910 --> 19:51.720
The chilli, you know the ozone...

19:53.930 --> 19:55.720
Forget it, you're impossible

19:56.270 --> 19:57.860
You just don't get it, do you?

19:58.580 --> 19:59.340
Get what?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.570
Sure, I'm mad about what you did to me.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.090
But it's why you did it that really hurts.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.030
Come on Jackson, I made a little mistake.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.480
It's not little, look.

20:09.530 --> 20:12.160
You're my sister and we may fight,

20:12.210 --> 20:13.760
We may pull stuff on each other

20:13.760 --> 20:16.390
but I will never drag that into the Hannah world.

20:17.890 --> 20:19.820
That's the line I would never cross and...

20:19.840 --> 20:21.610
I can't believe you thought I would!

20:25.220 --> 20:28.060
Jackson look I... I'm sorry...

20:28.680 --> 20:30.550
I never should've thought that you would

20:31.990 --> 20:32.940
OK, we're cool.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.030
We're cool? That's it?

20:36.230 --> 20:39.660
Yeah, I just wanted you to know
 why you were apologizing?

20:40.060 --> 20:43.080
So I did all this humiliating stuff for nothing?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.610
Well I wouldn't say this for nothing...

20:46.300 --> 20:48.800
It was enormously entertaining

20:49.470 --> 20:50.500
Well done.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.270
You're a horrible brother.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.250
And you are a bratty sister.

20:58.830 --> 21:01.810
Oh my gosh, I gotta go try to explain this to Drew

21:01.810 --> 21:03.560
so he doesn't think I'm a total dork.

21:05.650 --> 21:07.430
-Eh, Miles?  -Ah?

21:08.930 --> 21:12.070
-Good luck. 
 -Thank you.

21:20.240 --> 21:24.160
Another root beer, this time, leave the can.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.670
Rico, what are you doing here?

21:29.670 --> 21:30.940
I thought you'd be line dancing with

21:30.940 --> 21:32.500
your little filly about right now.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.230
She stood me up.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.490
I'm sorry to hear that buddy, we're both been there.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.560
Well it's never happened to 
me but I've seen it in the movies.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.460
I just never got a chance to show her my moves.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.720
I consider that's her loss.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.090
Let's see if we can get you cheered up.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.870
Country style.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.130
Howdy ma'am.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.880
Cowboy love strikes again.

22:23.305 --> 22:29.407
