02:13.566 --> 02:18.435
Uncle Phil! Man! How are you doing?

02:18.505 --> 02:20.564
I am not your uncle Philip.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.132
My fault, man.
I must have got the wrong crib.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.345
I didn't know there were so many brothers
living in this neighborhood.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.541
We're doing all right, huh?

02:32.185 --> 02:35.985
You have the right house.
I am Geoffrey, your uncle's butler.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.183
Okay, well, I... Cheerio and all that rot.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.361
Bring the horses round, would you?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.556
If you will follow me...

02:46.633 --> 02:49.568
I will show you to your room,
Master William.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.405
Hey, man, it's cool if you just call me Will.

02:53.806 --> 02:55.774
Master William...

02:55.842 --> 02:58.538
tradition dictates
that a clean, unbreakable line...

02:58.611 --> 03:01.136
be drawn between
a family and their butler.

03:01.214 --> 03:04.479
Therefore, it is necessary
for the operation of a household...

03:04.551 --> 03:07.179
that you address me as Geoffrey...

03:07.253 --> 03:11.952
and I, in turn, address you
by your proper title: Master William.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.622
Who are you, Robo-butler, man?

03:17.463 --> 03:19.363
Come with me, Master William.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.060
Yo, G. Let me rap to you for a second.

03:22.435 --> 03:25.165
All this Master William stuff,
I'm not down with that, man.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.706
Make it sound like
we're back on the plantation, like:

03:27.774 --> 03:30.174
"Massa William! Massa William!"

03:30.376 --> 03:33.072
Let's come up with something better
that you could call me.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.511
What would you prefer?

03:34.581 --> 03:38.017
Check this: "His Royal Freshness."
That's dope.

03:42.188 --> 03:45.089
Master William, walk this way.

03:45.858 --> 03:46.882
No.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.323
- Willie!
- Hey, Aunt Viv!

03:51.397 --> 03:53.490
- Sweetie, hi.
- How you doing?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.866
My goodness, let me look at you.
Turn around.

03:57.937 --> 04:01.168
The last time we saw you,
you were this funny little boy.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.007
Now look at you.
My goodness, you are a man.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.739
That was the plan.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.579
It is amazing.
You certainly have grown, Will.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.345
Well, we all have.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.349
Did you enjoy the trip?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.720
The plane ride was stupid.
All the way first-class...

04:18.791 --> 04:19.849
Excuse me?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.861
- I'm saying the plane was dope...
- Excuse me?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.359
No. Stupid, dope...

04:24.430 --> 04:27.194
No, that doesn't mean what you...
How would he say...

04:27.267 --> 04:29.360
The flight was really neat.

04:36.643 --> 04:40.010
Geoffrey, would you take Will to his room,
and help him get settled in?

04:40.079 --> 04:42.309
- Yes, Madam.
- Nice seeing you.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.612
- Master William.
- You got to love this guy, right?

04:48.087 --> 04:50.817
- Did you see the way he was dressed?
- What's wrong with it?

04:50.890 --> 04:54.257
- You hear that language?
- We used slang when we were kids.

04:54.327 --> 04:57.319
Do you remember our first date?
You took one look at me and said:

04:57.397 --> 05:00.696
"That is a bad dress."
You could've just said it was a good dress.

05:00.767 --> 05:04.396
I could have, if I liked it.
Actually, it was a bad dress.

05:08.207 --> 05:09.469
That's stupid.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.874
Now, take it
for whatever meaning you want.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.502
Now he's got you doing it.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.878
Philip, cut him some slack, please.
He's my nephew.

05:16.949 --> 05:20.146
And I would just appreciate it
if you would try to understand him.

05:20.219 --> 05:21.447
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.546
- Hi, sweetie pie.
- Hi, Ashley.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.214
Yo, this place is huge, man.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.523
Next time I go to my room,
I'm gonna take some bread crumbs.

05:31.364 --> 05:35.994
- Will, this is Ashley.
- Hi. My little Scottish cousin.

05:37.136 --> 05:40.765
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm your humble servant.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.865
- He's cute.
- I know he is.

05:43.242 --> 05:47.110
- I'm gonna take a swim before dinner.
- Good luck. The pool heater's broken.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.116
- Don't you just hate it when that happens?
- Yes, that is my pet peeve.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.681
- You got your own pool here?
- And a tennis court, too.

05:56.756 --> 06:01.125
<i>Yo, this is better than Love Boat.
This boy gonna be maxing and relaxing.</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:03.059
Hold on just a minute, son.

06:03.129 --> 06:06.895
We promised your mother that you're here
to work hard, straighten out...

06:06.966 --> 06:09.764
and learn some good old-fashioned
American values.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.567
Dad, I need $300.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.065
Hilary, your cousin Will is here.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.303
Hi. Dad, I need $300.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.275
That's a lot of money, Hilary. What for?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.844
I need a new hat.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.747
- For what?
- Probably her head.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.256
Okay, I'm going on the Save the Ozone
celebrity bus next Saturday.

06:35.328 --> 06:39.628
It's gonna be Bruce Willis and Demi,
Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez...

06:39.699 --> 06:41.564
or Charlie Sheen, I can't remember which.

06:41.634 --> 06:44.569
We're taking the bus all over town
to protest air pollution...

06:44.637 --> 06:48.038
and then we're gonna motor to the beach
and have a big bonfire.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.004
What?

06:53.479 --> 06:55.879
I'm not an expert or anything,
but don't you think...

06:55.948 --> 06:58.815
driving a big old bus around town
and then having a bonfire...

06:58.885 --> 07:01.353
is sort of adding
to the problem of pollution?

07:06.893 --> 07:09.123
Look, if this weren't a good idea...

07:09.195 --> 07:12.460
I really don't think
Ally Sheedy would be involved.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.851
Hey, look who's here. Benson.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.258
- This is for you.
- But I didn't get you anything.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.398
Your uncle has invited several
of the partners from his law firm to dinner.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.938
At the time of the invitation,
he did not realize...

07:55.007 --> 07:59.535
you'd be descending upon him today.
And regrettably, it was too late to cancel.

07:59.612 --> 08:02.843
Yo, are we having a party?
We're gonna get stupid, right?

08:03.916 --> 08:07.647
For some of us,
that will require very little effort indeed.

08:09.589 --> 08:13.491
- Miss Ashley.
- That will be all, Geoffrey.

08:17.463 --> 08:21.297
That's all you had to say to get rid of him?
I've been racking my brain.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.067
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Ashley.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.466
This is nice. You're very talented.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.135
Well, I'm glad I'm good at something.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.212
I tried out for the school chorus today,
but I didn't get in.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.270
How come?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.442
Well, when I auditioned for Mrs. Berkley...

08:38.518 --> 08:40.543
I couldn't remember
all the words to the song.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.485
The part I remembered was fantastic.

08:42.554 --> 08:46.184
- I'm sure it was. I bet you're def.
- That's what she said.

08:47.159 --> 08:51.892
Not deaf. D-E-F. That's just slang.
Means terrific, good.

08:52.398 --> 08:53.422
Thank you.

08:53.499 --> 08:54.625
You should try rapping.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.691
When you're rapping,
you mess up the words...

08:56.769 --> 08:59.465
and make up some new ones
right there on the spot.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.667
Let's try this. I'll sing one line,
you make up a line to rhyme it.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.903
- Okay.
- All right. Let's see.

09:05.411 --> 09:08.244
"You didn't get into
Miss Berkley's chorus"

09:11.117 --> 09:13.950
- I'm thinking, all right?
- That's all right. We got all day.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.253
- Okay, I've got it.
- Here we go.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.016
"You didn't get into
Miss Berkley's chorus"

09:20.092 --> 09:23.323
"I'd like to hit her in the head
with Roget's Thesaurus"

09:23.396 --> 09:26.229
"Don't need no choir
when you're a rapper"

09:26.432 --> 09:28.957
"Gonna hunt Miss Berkley down
and zap her"

09:29.035 --> 09:31.765
"Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzing"

09:31.871 --> 09:34.601
"Get a load of me and my rapping cousin"

09:36.208 --> 09:39.041
Ashley, why don't you go downstairs
and get ready for dinner.

09:39.111 --> 09:42.171
- Okay, Daddy. Bye, Will.
- Check you later, Ash.

09:43.115 --> 09:44.810
Look who's here, Will.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.951
Who is he?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.119
It's your cousin, Carlton.
Don't you remember?

09:57.196 --> 09:59.721
When you two were little,
people thought you were twins.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.790
You looked exactly alike.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.502
I guess some things never change.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.070
- How's it going there, Will?
- It's going all right.

10:07.139 --> 10:10.438
- Malcolm X.
- He's sort of my hero.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.334
Well, he was a great man.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.572
I don't know
if I'd call him my hero exactly.

10:14.647 --> 10:17.548
- Really? Who are your heroes?
- Well, my dad.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.485
And Bryant Gumbel. He's darn good.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.356
Oh, my, yes!

10:26.993 --> 10:28.722
I see they brought your tuxedo.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.227
Tell me something, Will.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.821
Have you ever attended
a formal dinner before?

10:32.898 --> 10:36.459
Other than that thing
at Buckingham Palace, no.

10:38.137 --> 10:41.004
The important thing to remember
is to relax, enjoy yourself...

10:41.073 --> 10:44.133
and when in doubt,
do whatever Carlton's doing.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.507
- You got it, man.
- Okay, I'll see you at dinner.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.811
- That's a really neat tux, isn't it, Will?
- Yes. It's definitely the cat's meow.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.554
Wait till we come downstairs
in those tuxes.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.526
People may not think we're twins,
but I bet they'll think we're brothers.

11:02.595 --> 11:06.588
I don't think you have to worry about
anybody mistaking you for a brother.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.429
Touché.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.330
This is going to be great.
Your first formal dinner.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.466
And tomorrow,
I'll introduce you to the gang.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.306
Maybe we'll play a set of tennis or two.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.577
Yes, this is going to be wild.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.828
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs changing.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.130
Not Will. President Reagan.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.271
- You didn't?
- What do you mean, I didn't?

11:46.338 --> 11:48.738
- You invited him again.
- Why not? He's our neighbor.

11:48.808 --> 11:53.245
He's turned down the last 16 invitations.
When are you gonna take a hint?

11:53.679 --> 11:56.512
- Maybe I should call his house.
- Don't. I don't want him here.

11:56.582 --> 11:59.050
- Why not?
- Because he'll bring her.

12:01.787 --> 12:06.349
Anyway, Bruce, Demi and I all feel
that the ozone layer must be protected.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.222
I mean, every square foot
of rain forest that's cut down...

12:09.295 --> 12:12.492
brings us just one step closer
to global warming.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.658
We have to learn to protect the earth.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.202
Not just for ourselves
and not just for our children...

12:17.269 --> 12:19.703
but for the future of all mankind.

12:20.306 --> 12:24.265
I had no idea
it was such a serious problem.

12:24.477 --> 12:29.005
I really commend you for getting involved
in such a good cause.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.643
Thanks. It's my passion.

12:33.986 --> 12:37.786
- Where can I send a donation?
- I don't know.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.268
Oh, my God!

12:53.038 --> 12:55.233
Philip, don't make a big thing out of it.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.834
If this is how he feels comfortable...
He's not killing anybody.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.277
Aren't you going to introduce Will?
Introduce him.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.809
Well, Steve, David, Henry.

13:07.319 --> 13:09.844
This is Will, my nephew by marriage.

13:15.861 --> 13:20.525
Will, these are my partners
in the law firm of Furth, Winn and Meyer.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.297
Earth, Wind & Fire!
When's your next album coming out?

13:25.004 --> 13:28.371
Will is going to go
to Bel-Air Academy with Carlton.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.308
Good for you, Will.
I used to fence at Bel-Air.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.643
Really? How much do you think
we could get for that stereo?

13:39.885 --> 13:42.046
These hors d'oeuvres look tempting.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.884
Don't mind if I do.

13:46.258 --> 13:50.160
- How could you do that?
- It's all in the tongue. I'll show you later.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.154
There are other people at this table.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.230
You're right.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.855
Any requests?

14:31.270 --> 14:34.899
- Sweetie, would you say grace, please?
- Yes, Mommy.

14:38.244 --> 14:40.644
"Hey, there, Lord
My name is Ashley Banks

14:40.713 --> 14:43.011
"My family and friends
Want to give you some thanks

14:43.082 --> 14:45.573
"So before this dinner's
All swallowed and chewed

14:45.651 --> 14:48.279
"Thank you, God, for this stupid food"

15:11.644 --> 15:13.737
Hey, Geoffrey, home butler.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.038
I'm glad to see you, man.

15:17.182 --> 15:19.810
It is a special thrill for me as well.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.050
Check this out.
I'm gonna be down here for a while.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.784
Why don't you hop on in the kitchen
and get me some cocoa?

15:25.858 --> 15:27.325
Master William...

15:27.393 --> 15:31.830
while it is my natural inclination
to accede to your every demand...

15:31.897 --> 15:34.491
I officially go off duty at 9:00 p.m.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.463
And if you care to look at your watch,
you will note...

15:37.536 --> 15:41.404
that the long hand is on 12,
and the short hand is on 9.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.601
It is 9:00, Master William.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.476
And do you know what that means?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.506
<i>Masterpiece Theatre is on.</i>

15:54.219 --> 15:56.687
Sir, do you require anything further of me?

15:56.755 --> 15:57.813
No, Geoffrey.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.619
Then I shall retire.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.592
Man, he took that hard.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.724
I want to talk to you.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.287
- About what?
- You know.

16:06.365 --> 16:09.334
From the minute you came,
you've been a one-man wrecking crew...

16:09.401 --> 16:12.495
trying to tear down what's taken
a lot of hard work to build up...

16:12.571 --> 16:15.665
skewering everything
with your flippant shenanigans!

16:15.741 --> 16:18.107
Man, I was with you up till "skewering."

16:21.146 --> 16:23.171
You know what I'm talking about.

16:23.549 --> 16:26.712
You deliberately tried
to embarrass me tonight and I don't get it.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.777
Your aunt and I went through
a lot of trouble to bring you here.

16:29.855 --> 16:32.221
- This is the thanks we get?
- I ain't asked to come.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.226
Everyone's talking about shipping me off,
and dressing me up...

16:35.294 --> 16:37.421
and changing me into something
I don't wanna be.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.020
Nobody wants to change you.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.396
You told me yourself
I got to straighten out.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.367
"When in doubt, act as Carlton acts."

16:43.435 --> 16:47.997
Man, I don't wanna be like Carlton.
I'm a joker. I play around. I have fun.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.598
Being a joker
is what's gotten you into trouble.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.509
You may think it's cool
to be on the streets when you're 17...

16:53.579 --> 16:55.547
but when you're my age, it's a waste.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.514
I can't think that far ahead.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.182
That's your problem.
You can't take anything seriously.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.019
Look, man, I don't have the problem.
You have the problem.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.888
I remind you of where you came from
and what you used to be.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.328
I don't know, somewhere between
Princeton or the office, you got soft.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.458
You forgot who you are
and where you came from.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.901
You think you're so wise.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.134
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

17:25.544 --> 17:30.413
Let me tell you something, son.
I grew up on the streets just like you.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.851
I encountered bigotry
you could not imagine.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.989
Now, you have a nice poster
of Malcolm X on your wall.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.450
I heard the brother speak.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.654
I read every word he wrote.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.190
Believe me, I know where I come from.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.436
- You actually heard Malcolm speak, man?
- That's right.

17:51.637 --> 17:55.573
So before you criticize somebody,
you find out what he's all about.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.544
I'll take care of you in the morning.
I'm going to bed.

17:59.611 --> 18:01.636
Hold on. I can't tell my side of the story?

18:01.713 --> 18:04.477
No, you can't.
I know what you're all about.

18:04.550 --> 18:08.179
Believe me, the very thought of it
makes me very tired.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.287
Good night.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
my fly girl, Ashley Banks.

19:19.725 --> 19:22.387
- Would you teach me how to dance?
- Yeah.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.793
Not in here.
Even I lose my rhythm in this room.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.024
Okay.

19:27.232 --> 19:29.530
- Could you do me a favor?
- Sure.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.633
I seem to be missing a Walkman.

19:31.703 --> 19:35.002
So if it shows up anywhere, like,
I don't know, on your head, maybe...

19:35.073 --> 19:37.371
maybe you could get that to me.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.836
- Sorry. Dad won't let me get one.
- How come?

19:40.913 --> 19:45.407
He says he wants to hear everything
I'm listening to, to make sure it's not bad.

19:45.484 --> 19:49.944
- What record does he think is good?
- He really likes the Care Bears.

19:53.992 --> 19:57.086
Ash, from time to time,
your father's gonna say or do things...

19:57.162 --> 20:00.620
that may seem irrational
or hard for you to understand.

20:00.832 --> 20:05.428
It's not because he's mean, or a bad guy,
or that he doesn't care about you.

20:05.737 --> 20:08.137
It's that he's from Mars, Ashley.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.741
- I gotta get washed up.
- Me, too.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.778
- I'm really glad you're living here.
- Thanks, Ash.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.872
You're like the big brother I never had.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.578
What are you talking about? You got...

20:20.652 --> 20:22.711
You're right. I see your point.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.652
How many bathrooms
you got in this place?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.191
Four and a half.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.386
A half bath? How does that work?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.420
It doesn't have everything
a full bathroom has.

20:32.497 --> 20:36.194
You better show me a full bathroom.
I don't want to take no chances.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.945
Next bathroom.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.288
Can't a person gargle in peace?

21:03.362 --> 21:07.696
Hilary, are you gonna be in there for long
or is this just like a pit stop?

21:07.866 --> 21:10.858
Stop hounding me.
I'm trying to take off my makeup.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.335
Now, go away.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.363
Okay, good night, Hilary.

21:26.918 --> 21:28.249
I knew it!

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
