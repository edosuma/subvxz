WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:05.830
JEREMY: So, the Winter Olympics
are belng held In Italy

00:05.910 --> 00:10.220
which, when you look at the place,
seems to be a bit too... warm.

00:18.550 --> 00:20.700
That's why we're in Norway.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.430
A proper winter country.

00:22.550 --> 00:25.700
And we've got some proper winter sports
lined up for you.

00:25.870 --> 00:29.980
So welcome, then,
to the Top Gear Winter Olympics.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.140 --> 00:41.610
It's the Winter Olympics speeded up a bit.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.290
Right. We'll begin with the biathlon.

00:53.380 --> 00:57.210
Now, normally, this is a combination
of skiing and shooting.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.890
But since this is Top Gear,
we'll be driving and shooting.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.860
JAMES: Let's start
by meeting the contestants.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.530
I shall be using this.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.650
The new Audi Q 7.

01:12.700 --> 01:17.050
Audi's first attempt
to make a school run 4x4.

01:22.330 --> 01:25.850
You see, the Q 7 is based loosely
on the Porsche Cayenne,

01:25.930 --> 01:29.400
but with all the really hardcore,
off-road stuff taken out.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.370
So it's a bit like having your big snow boots

01:32.450 --> 01:34.520
made by that Jimmy Choo's bloke.

01:37.170 --> 01:41.050
It's a full three inches longer
than a Land Rover Discovery

01:41.130 --> 01:44.490
and it's a full 3% uglier than a troll.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.880
But there are some good things about it.

01:46.970 --> 01:51.010
It has a very, very good
V6 3-litre diesel engine,

01:51.090 --> 01:55.800
an excellent gear box
and, most importantly, it has seven seats.

01:56.650 --> 02:00.120
And the price for this, the 3-litre diesel SE?

02:00.370 --> 02:02.960
Just under 40,000.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.440
Very good.

02:06.530 --> 02:10.310
The second sort of
semi off-roader for families.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.160
But what's the point of being second?

02:12.240 --> 02:14.550
That's like driving around in Buzz Aldrin.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.640
I'd much rather have Neil Armstrong.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.950
So here he is. The car I'll be using
as I bid for Olympic gold.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.310
It's the Volvo XC90.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.710
This was the first seven-seat 4x4

02:30.800 --> 02:32.840
designed by someone who had children.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.040
Not by an engineer who had
read about them in a book.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.270
It's a brilliant car. Really is.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.400
It's not mumsy. It's not gittish.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.670
It's like the family pet.
It's like having a faithful, old Labrador.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.470
There's more, too.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.270
It's got a smooth, new diesel engine,

02:54.360 --> 02:58.670
it's more spacious than the Audi
and it's 4,000 pounds cheaper.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.110
So, which is best?

03:03.710 --> 03:05.910
The Labrador or Buzz Aldrin?

03:05.990 --> 03:09.300
Well, that's what we're going to find out
in our biathlon.

03:10.790 --> 03:11.860
The rules are very simple.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.150
You drive three kilometres
around the course,

03:14.230 --> 03:16.380
stop, shoot at five targets,

03:16.470 --> 03:19.270
and there's a five second time penalty
for every miss.

03:19.350 --> 03:22.150
Yeah. Then we do another three kilometres
on another course,

03:22.230 --> 03:24.580
come back here, shoot at the targets again,

03:24.670 --> 03:26.900
this time lying down
in the back of the cars,

03:26.990 --> 03:28.740
then it's a sprint to the finish.

03:28.830 --> 03:31.390
The winner, that will be me, gets gold

03:31.470 --> 03:34.820
and the loser
gets to eat some golden snow.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.900
Come on!

03:44.630 --> 03:48.220
JEREMY: James grabbed an early lead
in his more powerful Audi.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.620
Whoa!

03:52.500 --> 03:55.220
And in my enthusiasm to catch him up...

03:56.100 --> 03:57.090
Trees!

03:59.140 --> 04:00.370
Oh (BLEEP).

04:03.220 --> 04:05.050
Oh, I love the Winter Olympics, me.

04:05.140 --> 04:08.660
JEREMY: He would because Captain Slow
was now well ahead.

04:09.860 --> 04:12.010
I don't want to eat golden snow.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.570
It's bumpy.

04:23.180 --> 04:28.010
Biathletes, they need to eat
6,000 calories a day. 6,000!

04:28.180 --> 04:30.970
That's the equivalent
of two pounds of butter,

04:31.100 --> 04:34.850
70 slices of bread, 112 eggs,

04:34.930 --> 04:38.770
86 tubs of yogurt, 28 potatoes,

04:38.890 --> 04:43.570
117 biscuits and 21 Twix bars.

04:44.330 --> 04:47.010
On that basis,
I could be an Olympic biathlete.

04:51.610 --> 04:55.840
Thanks to my off, James had
already arrived at the shooting ranges.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.720
Magazine in.

05:00.810 --> 05:02.720
Now, your real biathlete arrives here

05:02.810 --> 05:05.560
with his heart doing
about 180 beats per minute.

05:05.650 --> 05:09.400
And he has to time this with his heartbeat
and his breathing.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.080
Shooting range.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.880
Five out of five to beat, Volvo man.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.670
I don't care about his score

05:28.760 --> 05:32.880
because not only is he using the wrong car,
he's using the wrong gun.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.910
.22 is all right when you're nine,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.960
but when you're in a hurry,
you need one of these.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.480
A Heckler & Koch MP5 machine pistol.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.350
Okay. Fully automatic.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.270
Eat lead, Olympic target!

05:54.720 --> 05:55.710
Oh, yeah.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.150
Staggeringly, I'd missed the lot.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.430
So that was a five second penalty
for each one.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.190
Oh, 25 seconds is a week!

06:12.390 --> 06:14.510
Nice and sideways there. Drop it down one.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.660
Okay, I'm about a minute
behind Captain Slow.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.350
There's a lot of time to be made up. Power!

06:22.470 --> 06:23.900
Yow! Airborne!

06:26.150 --> 06:28.790
Diesel, of course,
is excellent for off-roading.

06:28.870 --> 06:31.100
As we're demonstrating now
when I turn this one in really tight.

06:31.190 --> 06:33.020
Give it a bit of boot.

06:35.470 --> 06:36.870
Environmentalists say

06:36.950 --> 06:39.750
that when the Gulf Stream stops,
Britain will look like this.

06:39.830 --> 06:40.980
Bring it on!

06:42.790 --> 06:46.420
JAMES: With Clarkson nowhere in sight,
I arrived back at the rifle range.

06:46.510 --> 06:50.260
And this time, we had to fire lying down
from inside the car,

06:50.350 --> 06:52.500
which meant dropping the rear seats.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.700
Right. Headrest out, down.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.530
That's it.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.820
In the Q 7, it was a doddle.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.340
I press that. That's it.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.540
Take cover.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.220
Come on!

07:18.780 --> 07:20.420
Oh, cock. I've missed a couple.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.970
JEREMY: Oh, May!
You're in the middle of the road!

07:25.980 --> 07:27.730
(HORN HONKING)

07:27.820 --> 07:28.930
(CHUCKLING)

07:29.860 --> 07:31.450
Stop beeping your horn.

07:33.860 --> 07:36.010
- JEREMY: Have you missed any?
- Yeah.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.290
Good, he's in the penalty bin. Right.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.890
Seats down.

07:41.140 --> 07:42.890
Now, the good thing is

07:43.770 --> 07:46.570
I actually have one of these cars at home.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.650
Well, how does that go down?

07:50.130 --> 07:51.730
That's not it.

07:55.730 --> 07:56.770
(GRUNTING)

07:56.850 --> 07:58.170
I'm stuck.

07:59.050 --> 08:00.960
How can I not know?

08:01.050 --> 08:03.040
I'm gonna have to phone my wife.

08:03.890 --> 08:05.210
Hi, darling...

08:05.330 --> 08:07.450
No, I know. I pulled the handle.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.440
Oh, the what?

08:09.530 --> 08:11.280
Okay, thanks. Aha!

08:11.370 --> 08:12.690
Go on.

08:12.770 --> 08:14.410
It's flat enough.

08:14.610 --> 08:16.840
Lower that. There we go.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.600
Of course, the great thing about
Jeremy's shooting is

08:19.690 --> 08:24.280
that you are perfectly safe just as long
as you stand right in front of the target.

08:24.370 --> 08:28.040
JEREMY: Actually, I'd learnt my lesson
and I wasn't gonna miss this time.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.910
So with James thundering along,
I was back in the penalty box.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.720
Stevie Wonder could have done better.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.840
A bit of air.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.840
That's...

08:57.920 --> 08:59.430
That's excellent.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.830
But then James stopped
thundering and started crashing.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.310
God.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.710
God.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.150
MAN: (ON RADIO) James is off!
James is off!

09:10.240 --> 09:12.070
James is off? Yes!

09:12.240 --> 09:14.830
I mean, no. Oh, no.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.190
Oh, poor James.

09:27.590 --> 09:30.630
Never has a Volvo
been driven like this before.

09:33.510 --> 09:35.710
- That's him.
- That's James.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.620
Come on, I can catch him!

09:47.270 --> 09:48.670
Sod off, Clarkson!

09:49.910 --> 09:52.870
We are neck and neck
as we're coming to the finish.

09:55.150 --> 09:56.790
No! He's gonna get ahead!

09:57.310 --> 09:59.770
He's on the outside. This is looking good.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.020
Oh, that's a mistake.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.490
JEREMY: Come on! Under steer!

10:07.580 --> 10:09.540
Oh, he's coming through!

10:10.980 --> 10:13.580
Come on! Come on! Yes!

10:13.700 --> 10:15.740
Oh, no! No!

10:15.820 --> 10:17.890
JAMES: Yes! Yes!

10:17.980 --> 10:21.580
I've won a Top Gear event! Yes!

10:25.620 --> 10:28.530
JEREMY: So that's one-nil to Captain Slow,

10:28.620 --> 10:32.850
despite what we both thought
was rather a poor car.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.770
Not only is it ugly,
but the air-suspension is too complicated

10:37.860 --> 10:40.050
and the seat layout is all wrong.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.850
Still, it didn't change the outcome.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.610
- You are kidding?
- It's your rules.

10:58.050 --> 11:00.520
I wish I hadn't used the machine gun.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.810
- Well, quite.
- What were you drinking?

11:05.170 --> 11:09.210
Anyway, you've probably noticed that
TV's Richard Hammond isn't with us today

11:09.290 --> 11:13.130
and that's because he's currently appearing
on commercial daytime television.

11:13.210 --> 11:17.970
Yes, he is. He's on live every afternoon
filling Paul O'Grady's slot.

11:19.570 --> 11:21.210
- Just realised what I said there.
- I know.

11:21.290 --> 11:24.090
Anyway, the thing is,
before he started entertaining

11:24.170 --> 11:26.000
the unemployed and the elderly,

11:26.090 --> 11:29.640
we gave him a taste of what life
would be like out here.

11:31.130 --> 11:33.640
RICHARD: Yes. In Nuneaton actually.

11:33.730 --> 11:37.800
This is the
Motor Industry Research Association.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.960
Here, cars are tested to destruction.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.710
And in this chamber,

11:43.800 --> 11:48.000
they can recreate the freezing
temperatures at the North Pole.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.880
It's the perfect place
for a Top Gear experiment.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.710
Namely, who breaks first in extreme cold?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.790
Car or man?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.440
The car we've chosen is a Citroen C1.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.480
One of the most basic vehicles you can buy.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.150
And the man it's going up against
is also pretty basic.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.270
Me.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.030
Oh, good.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.190
According to a top frostbite boffin,

12:22.280 --> 12:24.790
the experience would not be pleasant.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.510
Sort of minus 30.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.160
You're gonna be in a lot of trouble
if you're still in the car.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.670
Ice crystals start to form
in the tissues of your skin.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.430
It will puncture the cells
and they'll stay frozen.

12:35.510 --> 12:36.580
Your fingers are gonna swell.

12:36.670 --> 12:40.110
Anything else that's got frostbitten,
particularly your manhood, might swell.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.390
It will blister,
it'll be very, very uncomfortable.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.540
And eventually, probably drop off.

12:44.910 --> 12:46.390
- Drop off?
- Drop off.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.150
ECG.

12:49.230 --> 12:51.980
RICHARD: In order to protect me
and my manhood,

12:52.070 --> 12:54.900
I was covered in temperature sensors.

12:54.990 --> 12:59.460
To be on the safe side, there needs to be
an actual thermometer in me.

13:00.110 --> 13:03.310
And this doesn't go in my mouth.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.180
The car got slightly more
dignified treatment.

13:08.550 --> 13:12.260
And finally, with me wearing just a scarf
and a woolly-pully,

13:12.390 --> 13:14.980
we were both ready for the big freeze.

13:15.070 --> 13:18.530
This is... Well, they were a bit worried
my nose might drop off.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.620
So they have to monitor the temperature
with that.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.740
It's all right, you'll get used to it.
You won't even notice it.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.770
The temperature was a mere minus three.

13:28.860 --> 13:33.810
So, the evil boffins activated
an 80-mile-an-hour Arctic wind.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.660
The battle is heating up.
Well, no. It's cooling down.

13:37.740 --> 13:39.090
You know, it's...

13:42.260 --> 13:44.690
Happily if I turn the ignition on,
everything works.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.530
So far, I'd say we're... We're even.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.850
We're both just hanging on in there.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.780
The C1 comes with a little socket
and you can plug in your iPod.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.130
And the office
have very kindly provided me with one.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.210
They've put some music on it.
So I don't know what we've got.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.130
(HOT, HOT, HOT PLAYING)

14:14.570 --> 14:17.130
I'd been in the wind tunnel
for over an hour now

14:17.210 --> 14:20.120
and it was almost minus 23 in the car.

14:30.570 --> 14:35.320
In the engine bay, it was closer
to a much toastier minus 17 degrees.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.290
So, surely, the engine would start.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.360
Battery works.

14:41.050 --> 14:42.770
(ENGINE STUTTERING)

14:43.970 --> 14:45.370
Come on.

14:47.810 --> 14:50.480
I'm giving you your best chance, come on!

14:50.970 --> 14:53.080
But there was no pulse.

14:53.530 --> 14:55.160
You are out!

14:56.400 --> 14:58.870
So, I'd already beaten the engine.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.350
The reason was I was running on blood.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.830
But the car was running on diesel.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.040
This is a little beaker of diesel.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.350
And look, it's gone
gloopy and solid because it's so cold.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.400
But the contest wasn't over.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.230
This was a battle to the finish
and the C1's electrics were still going.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.440
However, the boffins were now
starting to get worried

15:23.520 --> 15:25.590
about my falling skin temperature.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.630
How's your nose getting on?
All your tackle okay? Still intact?

15:28.720 --> 15:29.830
Presumably.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.900
It's minus 26 in here now.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.950
Wonder if the car battery still works.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.350
Give it a shot. Yeah.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.310
Hang on. I can't...

15:41.950 --> 15:44.910
The gearbox oil, it's all frozen up.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.430
Try the iPod.

15:48.390 --> 15:51.350
(SUMMER OF '69 PLAYING)

16:12.270 --> 16:15.300
The evil boffins reactivated the Arctic wind

16:15.390 --> 16:19.780
and the temperature plummeted
to minus 40 degrees centigrade.

16:22.790 --> 16:26.540
Amazingly, the electrics still worked. Just.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.660
I was now in the frostbite zone
and close to cracking.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.980
My brain was so fuddled.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.570
Is today light paper...

16:36.660 --> 16:40.540
It had trouble tackling
a simple eleven plus test.

16:44.620 --> 16:45.610
What?

16:48.620 --> 16:50.980
The boffins were gonna have to pull me out.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.290
But would the car crack first?

16:53.660 --> 16:55.140
Right. Here we go.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.290
Oh.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.610
It's...

17:02.580 --> 17:03.770
had it.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.849
Nobody can deny it hung on in there.

17:07.940 --> 17:10.730
It never claimed to be
a polar exploration vehicle.

17:10.819 --> 17:12.930
It's a tiny, little, cheap super Mini.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.480
It did incredibly well, but in the end,

17:15.579 --> 17:17.329
I was better.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.680
So, there you are.
If you want to drive to the North Pole,

17:24.770 --> 17:26.170
buy a Hammond.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.240
Yes.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.600
JEREMY: That was amazing, wasn't it?
JAMES: Yeah, incredible.

17:31.690 --> 17:33.840
JEREMY: Mind you, did you see
how many clothes he was wearing?

17:33.930 --> 17:36.600
Yeah. It must've been
absolutely freezing in there.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.560
Either that or he was a big girl's blouse.

17:41.650 --> 17:42.970
Yeah.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.240
Anyway, time for our next event.

17:52.690 --> 17:55.000
JAMES: This is speed skating.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.570
Which, in the proper Olympics,

17:58.650 --> 18:01.600
involves a lot of men in condoms
slithering about.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.440
(HEART BEATING)

18:05.680 --> 18:08.520
In a race,
their hearts beat 200 times a minute

18:08.600 --> 18:10.720
and it's all jolly exciting.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.800
But we think we can do better.

18:15.760 --> 18:18.070
This is our ice skate.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.040
The brand new Jaguar XK8.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.870
And this is Torvill.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.510
What the older, fatter Torvill
is going to be doing

18:33.600 --> 18:35.480
is racing this fellow.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.150
That is Eskil Ervik

18:38.240 --> 18:41.590
and he's the world record holder
for the 1500 metres

18:41.760 --> 18:43.430
skating quickly thing.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.790
Right. It's a 1500 metre race, three laps.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.180
And they're off. Well, he is anyway.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.750
That didn't go well.

19:02.990 --> 19:04.350
Now, oh, that's...

19:04.470 --> 19:07.590
That's extraordinary.
There's no grip at all here.

19:10.470 --> 19:13.590
No braking and no real steering.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.020
(EXCLAIMING)

19:20.510 --> 19:22.150
Bit of a slip from Torvill there.

19:22.230 --> 19:23.420
Here comes May.

19:23.510 --> 19:26.180
I think he's gaining on you.

19:39.950 --> 19:43.570
JAMES: The skater was hitting
40 miles per hour through the bends.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.300
Jeremy was barely touching four.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.650
I don't think this is gonna make it
as an Olympic sport.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.170
You could slow down
a ruddy funeral at this rate.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.900
I'm going as fast...

20:08.580 --> 20:13.130
This is so irritating,
having a man keeping up with me.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.770
He's just gone past me again!

20:26.060 --> 20:28.730
He's just toying with me now. Look at him.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.360
No.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.730
I suspect it was my driving
that let the Jag down there

20:43.810 --> 20:47.880
because on the face of it,
this does seem to be quite a car.

20:50.450 --> 20:55.130
Obviously, on snowy roads like these,
I can't possibly do a proper road test.

20:55.210 --> 20:58.280
So we'll do that back in Britain
in the spring.

20:58.370 --> 21:02.080
But there are some things
that I can tell you now.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.760
For instance, it's faster
and has two more seats

21:08.850 --> 21:11.040
than the new baby Aston.

21:13.170 --> 21:16.000
But it costs 15,000 pounds less.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.590
Oh, sure,
the Aston's a beautiful looking car,

21:21.680 --> 21:24.990
but this isn't what
you'd call a minger, is it?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.080
It was designed by the same man
who did the Aston.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.040
And if you think
it's beautiful on the outside,

21:35.120 --> 21:37.480
wait till you see the interior.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.590
Old Jags were all full of wood
and pipe tobacco.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.640
It was like being inside James May.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.640
But this one,

21:49.720 --> 21:52.790
it's like being inside James Kirk.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.950
It really is a starship in here.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.310
And it goes like one, too.

22:09.430 --> 22:10.870
Really is very quick.

22:10.950 --> 22:14.660
Or it would be
if I had a bit more space to play with.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.110
You could have so much fun on this road.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.340
Followed by such an enormous accident.

22:27.830 --> 22:32.190
So, because it was going dark,
which it does every 15 seconds in Norway,

22:32.270 --> 22:35.390
I went back to meet James at the hotel.

22:37.110 --> 22:41.150
To make a plan for the next
Top Gear Winter Olympic event.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.730
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

22:53.500 --> 22:56.580
You know that Jag? You know it wasn't
very good at speed skating.

22:56.660 --> 22:57.650
No.

22:57.740 --> 23:01.660
Well, I was wondering,
how would it be at like, off-road,

23:01.740 --> 23:03.020
slalom,

23:03.100 --> 23:05.380
speed-dance-skating?

23:05.660 --> 23:09.340
Well, Jeremy, I've no idea
because there's no such thing.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.300
There is. I've just thought of it.
What you need, okay...

23:11.380 --> 23:13.770
No, honestly. Get a great, big, open area.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.290
- A frozen lake, then.
- Perfect.

23:15.380 --> 23:18.500
And then carve a sort of course in it.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.420
And then you drive round it.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.970
Yeah, but what you want then
is a four-wheel drive car.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.380
- No, you don't.
- Yes, you do.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.810
Think about it.
The lake doesn't freeze like that, does it?

23:27.900 --> 23:29.250
It freezes level.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.490
It's nothing to do with hills.
You need four-wheel drive...

23:31.580 --> 23:34.090
Four-wheel drive
will give you control in slippery corners.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.160
That's what it's for.

23:35.260 --> 23:37.930
That's why rally cars are four-wheel drive.
You need four-wheel drive.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.370
- No, you won't.
- You will.

23:39.450 --> 23:42.410
You won't. And in the morning,
after we've had a million more beers,

23:42.490 --> 23:44.290
I'm gonna prove it to you.

23:44.370 --> 23:45.850
- Fine.
- You just wait.

23:45.930 --> 23:48.920
We've got a long time to wait till morning
in Norway...

23:54.330 --> 23:57.210
JEREMY: Sometime the next afternoon,
it was morning,

23:57.290 --> 24:00.010
and we found the perfect frozen lake.

24:00.530 --> 24:03.170
James also found his perfect car.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.880
The four-wheel drive Land Rover Discovery.

24:08.810 --> 24:12.480
Right. I'm going to build a track
and this is what I've got in mind.

24:12.570 --> 24:15.480
It's gonna start with a long,
sweeping curve,

24:15.570 --> 24:18.760
where Jeremy will get carried away
and apply the power.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.800
And then it will come down to a straight

24:20.890 --> 24:25.360
where there will be a series of
tightening S's, where Jeremy will crash,

24:25.450 --> 24:28.280
if he hasn't already, then there's gonna be
another sweeping curve.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.640
And over the other side, there's gonna be
another series of tightening S's.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.560
And then finally, it will come back
and join the big curve again.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.160
Very good. But what James hadn't realised

24:41.240 --> 24:43.390
was that the ice might not be thick enough

24:43.480 --> 24:45.760
for his big Land Rover.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.560
So, at this point it is...

24:50.120 --> 24:52.550
- that thick.
- Yes.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.390
Do people fall through the ice in Norway
on lakes?

24:55.480 --> 24:56.750
Yes.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.320
Often?

24:58.400 --> 24:59.990
- Two last week.
- Two last week?

25:00.080 --> 25:01.720
- Yes.
- And are they dead?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.120
Quite dead.

25:07.280 --> 25:11.830
And James would be competing in a car
that weighs nearly three tonnes.

25:14.630 --> 25:16.430
Whereas my Jag was sitting,

25:16.510 --> 25:20.190
as you can see
from its satellite navigation screen,

25:21.110 --> 25:22.940
right in the middle of the lake.

25:23.030 --> 25:25.020
No problem at all.

25:25.110 --> 25:27.100
Because it's made from aluminium

25:27.190 --> 25:30.230
and therefore weighs about three ounces.

25:36.110 --> 25:39.820
Unaware of the problem,
Bob the Builder was busy with a tractor,

25:39.910 --> 25:42.060
carving out a course.

25:43.950 --> 25:47.910
It's cutting down
onto the five-foot thick ice.

25:48.430 --> 25:51.420
And while he did that,
I went for a sneaky practice

25:51.510 --> 25:53.620
in my two-wheel drive Jag.

25:56.550 --> 25:57.690
Oh, no!

26:03.780 --> 26:06.220
I'm alarmingly out of control here.

26:13.580 --> 26:14.980
Here's Mr May.

26:15.940 --> 26:18.170
You know, in real ice skating,

26:18.260 --> 26:20.170
- people sort of do this.
- Yeah.

26:20.260 --> 26:22.090
- And that. And this.
- Yeah.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.820
- Do you know what you're doing?
- What?

26:23.900 --> 26:26.370
You're going out onto an ice rink
and going...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.210
Like that.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.970
JEREMY: Finally, our off-road, speed dance,

26:32.060 --> 26:35.020
men's, women's, no hill,

26:35.100 --> 26:38.450
two-wheel drive, challenge slalom

26:38.540 --> 26:40.100
was ready.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.610
- Good track that, James.
- Not bad, is it?

26:42.740 --> 26:44.140
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'll have a go.

26:44.220 --> 26:46.650
- How thick is the ice?
- Oh, you'll be fine.

26:46.740 --> 26:48.330
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.210
And we're off.

26:59.770 --> 27:03.080
Nice bit of drift there
and flick it the other way.

27:05.650 --> 27:09.400
This is the best way to get the power
of the big V8 down onto the ice.

27:09.490 --> 27:12.240
It's with four-wheel drive,
intelligent differentials,

27:12.330 --> 27:13.810
intelligent traction control.

27:13.890 --> 27:17.200
Not just booting it and shouting.

27:22.890 --> 27:25.040
You just don't need
four-wheel drive out here.

27:25.130 --> 27:26.770
You just don't need it.

27:28.650 --> 27:29.680
Oh, yes.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.880
Thought I heard the ice crack.

27:37.880 --> 27:41.640
I'm reckoning on Jeremy not even being
able to face the correct direction in this.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.480
He'll just go round and round
in little circles.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.840
Oh, what a drift.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.030
Very safe, very steady.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.070
And it took him
two minutes, three seconds.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.960
- Pathetic.
- Rubbish, man...

28:04.040 --> 28:05.760
You were hardly moving.

28:05.840 --> 28:08.800
Rubbish, I was going at a good,
consistent speed and in control,

28:08.880 --> 28:10.910
which is the point I'm trying to make.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.640
- You were barely moving.
- There were beautiful movements.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.630
The other disappointment
was that you didn't actually

28:15.720 --> 28:18.180
fall through the ice,
because do you know how thick it is?

28:18.280 --> 28:19.680
Four feet?

28:20.320 --> 28:22.070
About five inches.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.950
- You're kidding?
- I'm not. It's about five inches.

28:25.790 --> 28:29.390
JEREMY: So, how would
the rear-wheel-drive Jag get on?

28:33.550 --> 28:34.780
Oh, yeah.

28:34.870 --> 28:38.580
With all this space, it was so much easier
and faster than it had been

28:38.670 --> 28:41.470
either on the ice rink or on the road.

28:42.270 --> 28:44.860
I'm sideways, in control. I look good.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.020
Power. Oh, no!

28:55.310 --> 28:58.780
That's a pirouette,
that is, in ice dancing circles.

28:59.710 --> 29:01.110
This is rubbish.

29:05.030 --> 29:07.670
Work a bit harder here, don't be lazy.
Come on.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.300
Come on, get in. Get in. Nose in.

29:11.390 --> 29:13.610
Give it some front-end grip now!

29:25.220 --> 29:26.740
It's good!

29:32.260 --> 29:33.620
It's bad!

29:35.860 --> 29:37.090
All right!

29:43.980 --> 29:45.300
Oh, yeah!

29:51.340 --> 29:53.410
I want one of these cars.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.140
No, wait, I want one of these lakes.

29:58.780 --> 30:00.740
The final big, sweeping corner.

30:00.860 --> 30:04.700
They're looking, I know,
for something elegant, something pretty.

30:05.980 --> 30:06.970
Whoa!

30:14.380 --> 30:15.940
- James!
- Very good.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.220
I won!

30:17.340 --> 30:19.140
- What do you mean, you won?
- I won!

30:19.220 --> 30:22.020
No, come on. I went round there
in two minutes, three seconds.

30:22.100 --> 30:25.620
You were actually 30 seconds behind
when you crashed.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.210
Look, ice dancing is not against the clock.

30:28.300 --> 30:31.380
It's about poise and delicacy and beauty.
And I was much more...

30:32.340 --> 30:34.100
beautiful than you were.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.730
Yes, but this is against the clock
and it proves that four-wheel drive

30:37.820 --> 30:41.820
has thrashed two-wheel drive.
That's the end of it. That was my victory.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.900
It's going dark, so we don't have
any more time to argue, okay?

30:44.980 --> 30:46.380
And the thing is

30:46.460 --> 30:50.090
that before he became mired in a world
of amusing shaped vegetables,

30:50.180 --> 30:53.860
Richard Hammond came to Norway
with James for a race.

30:53.940 --> 30:56.380
Yes, and we thought
we'd show it to you again.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.420
- Now...
- But just before...

30:58.500 --> 31:01.020
Go and get your Discovery
'cause I need to pull this out.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.170
- Can I show you something first?
- What?

31:03.260 --> 31:05.540
Since we were talking about
Richard Hammond,

31:05.620 --> 31:07.380
your car's had its teeth whitened.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.820
(BOTH LAUGHING)

31:11.660 --> 31:16.420
RICHARD: Lillehammer has one of the most
formidable bobsleigh runs in the world.

31:16.580 --> 31:21.500
The downhill course of twists and turns
stretches for almost two kilometres.

31:32.790 --> 31:36.020
Even so, a crack bobsleigh team
can get down this run

31:36.110 --> 31:37.620
in just under a minute,

31:37.710 --> 31:40.860
with the bobsleigh itself
hitting 80 miles an hour.

31:41.270 --> 31:43.860
The speed comes at a price
for the passengers, though,

31:43.950 --> 31:45.940
because each member
of the bobsleigh team

31:46.030 --> 31:49.380
is subjected to cornering forces of 5G.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.700
That's more than an F1 driver suffers.

31:52.150 --> 31:55.340
Honestly, to do this
you'd have to be brave, stupid

31:55.430 --> 31:58.340
or just desperate to get on the television.

31:58.510 --> 32:01.140
So this is where I'll be sitting,
here in the middle.

32:01.230 --> 32:04.900
And to make things even more arduous,
we're gonna have a race.

32:06.910 --> 32:09.820
We've come to Lillehammer
because alongside the bobsleigh run,

32:09.910 --> 32:11.300
we have this road.

32:11.390 --> 32:13.820
They start in the same place,
they run down the hill,

32:13.910 --> 32:15.820
and they finish in the same place.

32:16.470 --> 32:19.820
JAMES: The road is almost exactly
the same length as the bob run.

32:19.950 --> 32:24.580
And like the bob run, it's slippery,
dangerous and full of difficult corners.

32:26.190 --> 32:28.340
It requires a special vehicle.

32:33.310 --> 32:34.940
So that's what we've got.

32:35.030 --> 32:37.670
It's a Mitsubishi Evo world rally car,

32:37.750 --> 32:41.300
with a 300 horsepower
turbocharged engine, four-wheel drive

32:41.390 --> 32:43.020
and studded tyres.

32:44.030 --> 32:47.500
So that's the challenge.
Can the rally car beat the bobsleigh?

32:47.590 --> 32:51.860
I happen to think it can, although
Hammond tells me it definitely can't.

32:53.150 --> 32:54.370
RICHARD: This is my bobsleigh run.

32:54.470 --> 32:57.380
It starts here and it wiggles
all the way down here and it finishes there.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.700
JAMES: And this is the road,
which is in green,

32:59.790 --> 33:01.660
and it starts here and it wiggles
all the way up there.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.580
But it finishes in exactly the same place.

33:03.670 --> 33:05.100
Yes, but here's a point.

33:05.190 --> 33:07.980
My bobsleigh can get from there
all the way down to there

33:08.070 --> 33:09.860
in less than a minute. You've had it.

33:09.950 --> 33:13.380
But, you see, all you've got to take you
from there to there is gravity.

33:13.470 --> 33:14.870
- Yes.
- That's nothing.

33:14.950 --> 33:18.060
Well, I've got 300 horsepower
and a huge turbocharger

33:18.150 --> 33:20.540
and 420 spikes in each tyre

33:20.630 --> 33:22.740
and gravity to get down there.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.820
Yes, but my bobsleigh was custom built
for going on ice.

33:25.910 --> 33:28.710
Your car has had to be sort of
adapted with clever tyres and stuff.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.220
- You're wearing tights.
- I am.

33:30.310 --> 33:32.900
I can't take lectures on physics
from a man in tights.

33:32.990 --> 33:35.980
- I am aware of the tights.
- Dancing, yes, but physics, no.

33:38.230 --> 33:41.260
JAMES: The truth is, though,
the bob is going to be hard to beat,

33:41.350 --> 33:43.910
which kind of counts me out
for driving the car.

33:47.510 --> 33:52.020
So instead we've got Henning Solberg,
the Norwegian National Rally champion.

33:53.710 --> 33:55.350
MAN: One, two, three.

33:55.430 --> 33:59.310
RICHARD: The bobsleigh's chance of victory
all depends on how good our start is.

33:59.390 --> 34:01.420
That means intense preparation for me

34:01.510 --> 34:03.420
and the Norwegian Olympic
Bobsleigh team.

34:03.510 --> 34:04.500
One, two.

34:06.790 --> 34:11.780
And while we practise running,
the driver visualises the course in his head.

34:15.989 --> 34:19.739
All of this provided
much merriment for the bone-idle May.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.659
- Are you warming up?
- Yes.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.550
I'm warming up as well.

34:24.670 --> 34:27.139
To be honest, I couldn't see
the funny side of it

34:27.230 --> 34:30.190
because I was really worried
about letting the team down.

34:32.150 --> 34:36.300
Any time you lose here, a second
is multiplied by three at the bottom.

34:36.389 --> 34:38.060
So that'll be three seconds.

34:38.150 --> 34:41.420
And I was also worried about
whether my body would cope.

34:41.510 --> 34:43.659
The key thing is, as you go into the corners,

34:43.750 --> 34:46.340
to hold your breath,
to get as much breath in as you can

34:46.429 --> 34:48.150
'cause that actually holds your body up.

34:48.230 --> 34:51.219
It supports you when you're being
subjected to G forces in the corners.

34:51.310 --> 34:55.100
Apparently, in a couple of places
down there, it hits 6.5G.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.700
The driver told me
he's been doing this six years

34:57.790 --> 35:00.100
and he's three centimetres shorter.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.140
I can't afford to lose three centimetres.

35:08.190 --> 35:11.470
James was strapped in
and I was ready to run.

35:13.710 --> 35:16.590
Our race rally driver
could hardly speak any English,

35:16.670 --> 35:20.550
but that didn't stop James
giving him a patronising British pep talk.

35:20.950 --> 35:25.230
Righto, Henning, it's the reputation
of internal combustion

35:25.310 --> 35:26.980
resting on your shoulders

35:28.110 --> 35:29.780
in the next minute or so.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.100
JAMES: I was going to time the car
with my trusty stopwatch.

35:35.190 --> 35:38.420
And Hammond's bob would be timed
by the course officials.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.620
This was it.

35:58.270 --> 36:00.860
Mind the trees, you nutter!

36:01.710 --> 36:03.830
RICHARD: We're starting to turn.

36:03.910 --> 36:07.740
That's a turn! That's a turn. 16 corners...

36:08.470 --> 36:10.540
Now that's three of them done.

36:13.510 --> 36:16.310
JAMES: Two kilometres on ice in a minute.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.870
Boy, has Henning got it all to do.

36:19.670 --> 36:22.060
Ooh, that hurts a lot. That's my head.

36:23.550 --> 36:24.540
(BLEEP)

36:25.830 --> 36:30.300
RICHARD: The bob may have started slow,
but it was just getting faster and faster.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.980
And these guys never use the brakes.

36:33.630 --> 36:35.030
No, no, no, no!

36:36.350 --> 36:38.950
Now there's a complex coming up...
Oh, that's one.

36:39.550 --> 36:41.270
And there's another.

36:41.790 --> 36:45.700
At midpoint, 1,000 metres in,
it was anybody's guess.

36:47.950 --> 36:49.910
JAMES: Right... The brakes, man!

36:53.670 --> 36:55.950
(SHOUTING)

36:56.030 --> 36:57.830
I'm banging my head!

37:03.270 --> 37:04.990
(MUFFLED HEART BEATING)

37:13.390 --> 37:15.460
Oh, my head! Big bumps!

37:16.870 --> 37:18.750
JAMES: Henning was just awesome.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.550
You can't go this fast on ice.

37:21.790 --> 37:23.070
(BLEEP)

37:24.350 --> 37:26.820
He hit the side! He's going to kill us!

37:31.310 --> 37:33.110
I don't want to die in tights!

37:49.550 --> 37:50.700
59:68.

37:51.990 --> 37:54.220
Did we win? What did he do?

37:57.630 --> 37:59.460
God.

37:59.550 --> 38:00.670
I'm broken.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.740
- What have you done it in?
- 59:68.

38:03.390 --> 38:05.590
Come on. Come on, come on.

38:06.670 --> 38:09.820
- 1:02:24.
- We won!

38:10.710 --> 38:12.460
We did it!

38:13.110 --> 38:16.190
The boys! Well, I hope I didn't
slow you up too much.

38:16.270 --> 38:17.830
- That was fantastic.
- Yeah.

38:17.910 --> 38:20.300
We did it. That really was something.

38:20.550 --> 38:22.860
Awesome. Yes!

38:26.590 --> 38:30.270
Right, that was last year, this is now,
and I have some good news.

38:30.510 --> 38:34.030
It's the weekend and Richard Hammond
has therefore been able to escape

38:34.110 --> 38:38.430
from his world of amusingly shaped
potato crisps and he's here!

38:41.150 --> 38:45.230
RICHARD: Up until now, Suzuki has been
well-known for making small jeeps

38:45.310 --> 38:47.590
and their reasonably priced cars.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.580
Everything else they've made
is about as interesting as that pine tree.

38:52.390 --> 38:55.230
Well, no, maybe that one there.
That one in the middle there.

38:58.990 --> 39:02.460
But now, out of nowhere,
they've come up with this,

39:02.550 --> 39:03.830
the new Swift.

39:03.910 --> 39:06.060
And I do mean out of nowhere.

39:06.150 --> 39:08.070
Just look at it.

39:08.150 --> 39:09.630
When this thing drives past,

39:09.710 --> 39:12.070
you really are going to give it
a second glance, aren't you?

39:13.150 --> 39:15.540
It costs less than eight grand,

39:15.630 --> 39:18.910
and yet for that, you get a perky
1.3 litre engine,

39:18.990 --> 39:23.550
CD player, electric mirrors, tinted glass
and some airbags.

39:27.150 --> 39:29.950
It does just about the cleverest thing
a small car can do.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.180
Which is, not feel like a small car.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.340
It feels big and solid.

39:34.430 --> 39:35.950
And it feels grown up.

39:36.030 --> 39:39.820
Which, considering what we're about
to do with it, is a good thing.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.550
You see, the last time
we tested a small car,

39:42.710 --> 39:45.590
we ended up playing football
with 10 of them.

39:51.670 --> 39:55.950
They were Toyota Aygos
and, frankly, it all got a bit messy.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.270
Thing is, it is a bit nippy for football

40:00.360 --> 40:02.510
in these conditions.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.710
But don't despair...

40:12.960 --> 40:15.590
because we can do this.

40:16.680 --> 40:20.430
I declare the Top Gear Winter Olympics

40:20.520 --> 40:24.350
Suzuki Swift Car Ice Hockey "Cha"

40:24.440 --> 40:25.470
open!

40:28.680 --> 40:30.710
RICHARD: Yes, this is the pitch

40:31.760 --> 40:33.990
and these are the players.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.350
Ten Suzuki Swifts, making it five a side.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.110
All piloted by local rally drivers.

40:40.840 --> 40:45.390
James and I would be team captains
and Jeremy the ref.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.270
RICHARD: Look, it's not difficult.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.710
Ice hockey is basically
the most violent sport in the world.

40:50.800 --> 40:54.070
- Bar none. So...
- So if you bite James...

40:54.160 --> 40:55.870
Oh, yeah. No, that...
I mean, if it gets really...

40:55.960 --> 40:58.110
If there is a death,

40:58.200 --> 41:00.030
then you have to put somebody
in the sin bin.

41:00.120 --> 41:02.510
- And that's when I blow my horn?
- Yes, if it all goes really nasty.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.670
- If I have to stop the game, I blow this?
- Yes.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.870
- So it's...
- Just you...

41:09.000 --> 41:10.950
The end's come off.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.390
RICHARD: With the stands packed
to the rafters and the giant puck in place,

41:15.480 --> 41:17.110
we were ready for the off.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.790
Okay, the blue team,
captained by Captain Slow!

41:20.880 --> 41:22.510
That's Primetime television.

41:22.600 --> 41:26.560
The red team, captained by
Richard Phillip Schofield Hammond!

41:26.640 --> 41:29.150
That's Daytime television! We're ready!

41:29.600 --> 41:30.820
(BLOWING AIR HORN)

41:48.000 --> 41:50.830
JAMES: Within a minute,
Daytime TVscored.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.390
Goal!

41:53.480 --> 41:56.040
Is it a "goal" in ice hockey? Yeah.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.030
Now, there were a lot of crashes
when we did this

42:06.120 --> 42:07.870
with the Aygos playing football.

42:07.960 --> 42:12.080
I think by putting it on ice,
we've made it a lot safer.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.480
JAMES: Despite my best football cliches...

42:21.560 --> 42:23.350
Oh, he's up like a salmon.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.790
We're on a clear run for goal.
It's the old one-two.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.390
JAMES: Team Primetime
were all over the place.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.670
It's gone wide.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.470
RICHARD: Meanwhile,
Daytime TV were on fire.

42:35.560 --> 42:38.470
And despite an obviously biased ref...

42:38.560 --> 42:41.950
JEREMY: Come on, James!
Come on, man, you've got it!

42:43.560 --> 42:45.710
RICHARD: We banged home goal two.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.990
Goal!

42:47.960 --> 42:51.350
And goal three in quick succession.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.630
Who's primetime now, then, boys?

42:53.720 --> 42:54.830
(WHOOPING)

42:54.920 --> 42:57.310
JAMES: Yes, my team were being trounced.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.670
And when we finally did score,

43:01.080 --> 43:02.830
guess who was otherwise engaged?

43:06.440 --> 43:10.070
Yes, all in all, the ref's grasp
of the game was poor.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.000
- Why has that happened?
- Well, that's...

43:13.080 --> 43:14.910
And why haven't you scored?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.270
- We have scored.
- Well, I haven't seen it.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.830
No, we just scored then. Who's the referee?

43:20.280 --> 43:21.630
- I fell over a bit.
- Did you?

43:21.720 --> 43:23.360
- You missed the goal?
- I missed the goal.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.030
If it's not declared, it's not a goal.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.270
Are you prepared to accept my word

43:26.360 --> 43:28.710
as a primetime television presenter
that we scored a superb goal?

43:28.800 --> 43:30.200
- Yes, I am.
- Good. Thank you, ref.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.470
- But I didn't actually see it.
- Oh, come on!

43:32.560 --> 43:34.830
RICHARD: Daytime were still
two goals ahead, though,

43:34.920 --> 43:36.830
and the ref didn't like that.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.310
What you...

43:38.400 --> 43:39.800
It's in the middle.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.510
RICHARD: James took
immediate advantage.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.790
Come on, boys!

43:47.680 --> 43:49.240
Come on, three, three, three!

43:50.680 --> 43:52.110
That's in. That's lovely.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.000
Goal!

43:54.080 --> 43:56.040
He's great, isn't he?
Give him a megaphone, he's happy.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.230
Come on, Bjorn and Bjorn.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.150
RICHARD: But moments later,
James crashed into his own man,

44:06.240 --> 44:08.750
leaving his goalmouth wide open for me.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.480
(HOWLING)

44:17.920 --> 44:20.430
RICHARD: After that,
the match really hotted up.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.880
For most people, that is.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.710
Oh, is that a beer?

44:37.120 --> 44:38.110
(WHOOPING)

44:41.680 --> 44:43.110
Oh, no. It's Hammond.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.430
Bloody hell, James.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.560
RICHARD: Still, another goal for Daytime,
making the score...

44:49.200 --> 44:52.880
That is now 5-2? 3? What?

44:53.600 --> 44:55.080
What is it?

44:58.160 --> 45:00.360
RICHARD: As the game
entered its final stages,

45:00.440 --> 45:03.270
the violence reached
proper ice hockey levels.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.110
Struck me own bloke, but never mind.

45:06.720 --> 45:10.680
These are proving themselves to be
tough little cars, these Swifts, I must say.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.520
Upside down!

45:15.040 --> 45:16.680
(HOWLING)

45:17.680 --> 45:19.830
That could be where he banged himself.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.640
MAN: Do you have any vacuum cleaner?

45:21.720 --> 45:24.600
- A vacuum cleaner?
- MAN: Yes, clean the seats.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.910
Does Top Gear have a vacuum cleaner? No.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.040
JAMES: Red 2 was out of action,

45:30.120 --> 45:32.400
but my joy was short-lived.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.350
There is a spare car.

45:34.840 --> 45:36.720
We're writing number 2 on it as we speak.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.470
He'll be back in business
with 90 seconds of play left.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.230
Whose side are you on, ref?

45:41.320 --> 45:44.950
I am totally impartial.
I've given you every possible opportunity.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.480
You've just let me down.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.280
Rubbish. I've scored two brilliant goals

45:50.360 --> 45:52.270
whilst you've been chatting up
some Norwegian woman

45:52.360 --> 45:53.950
and standing in the bar.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.430
- That was my wife.
- It was his wife.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.190
RICHARD: With play almost over,

46:04.280 --> 46:08.200
I accidentally, but very accurately,
took out James.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.560
I'm out!

46:09.640 --> 46:11.470
Hammond in the sin bin.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.480
I can't believe I got sin-binned. For what?

46:19.560 --> 46:23.160
Go on ITV, you go in the sin bin.
It's that simple.

46:24.240 --> 46:28.200
RICHARD: With me shackled,
Primetime brought the score up to 5-4.

46:28.760 --> 46:29.990
Oh, come on, ref!

46:30.080 --> 46:32.150
Hammond, you may rejoin!

46:33.040 --> 46:35.320
And that's the end of the game, everybody!

46:35.400 --> 46:36.390
(LAUGHING)

46:36.480 --> 46:37.880
(CARS HONKING)

46:37.960 --> 46:39.870
RICHARD: No matter, Daytime have won,

46:39.960 --> 46:44.240
which meant for James,
there could only be one post-match drink.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.070
- So how was the snow?
- It was golden, thank you, Jeremy.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.600
Yes! And that, gentlemen,
is how you do that.

46:50.680 --> 46:53.960
And with that, I must get back
to the world of light entertainment.

46:54.040 --> 46:56.160
- I wouldn't if I were you.
- Why?

46:56.640 --> 46:58.870
- 'Cause of what we're doing next.
- Which is?

46:59.720 --> 47:00.790
That.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.840
- JAMES: Oh, you are joking?
- I am staying.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.200
JEREMY: This is the ski jump
at Lillehammer.

47:17.280 --> 47:21.480
The very one used
in the 1994 Winter Olympics.

47:22.080 --> 47:24.440
It offers jumpers 400 feet

47:24.520 --> 47:27.320
of pure, unbridled terror.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.000
Right, chaps. We have got to get that...

47:45.080 --> 47:47.440
to jump further than him

47:47.520 --> 47:50.160
in the Top Gear Winter Olympics

47:50.240 --> 47:53.870
Ski Slash Car Jumping "Champio."

47:56.320 --> 48:00.280
JEREMY: A 20-year-old, slightly rusty,
Leyland Mini.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.040
So, let's work this out.
Mini does 0 to 60 in what?

48:05.120 --> 48:06.840
About 14 seconds.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.070
Hang on, that's not going to be
very relevant, though, is it?

48:09.160 --> 48:10.880
'Cause you're not going to get
any grip off the tyres.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.560
All you got up there is gravity.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.280
Gravity is a cruel
and unpredictable mistress, so...

48:15.360 --> 48:18.160
Well, no, it isn't.
It's a constant all over the world.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.160
This is quite simple, arithmetically.
We've got...

48:20.250 --> 48:23.040
It's v=u+at. We know what
acceleration due to gravity is,

48:23.130 --> 48:24.960
9.8 metres per second squared.

48:25.050 --> 48:27.510
But that's weight component down a plain
'cause it's on a slope.

48:27.610 --> 48:30.320
We need to get the mass of the car,
we need to know the angle of the slope,

48:30.410 --> 48:33.280
then we need to work out the angle
when it gets to the lip where it jumps off

48:33.370 --> 48:35.800
and that will give us "v".
Then it will follow a parabolic trajectory

48:35.890 --> 48:37.720
we should be able to
then calculate the exact point

48:37.810 --> 48:39.840
when the car comes and meets the snow.

48:39.930 --> 48:42.360
- It's quite easy.
- I think we should go and get a cup of tea

48:42.450 --> 48:44.120
and work that out.

48:45.770 --> 48:48.040
- JEREMY: So come on, James.
- Hang on, hang on.

48:48.130 --> 48:50.320
Is gravity going to be enough

48:50.410 --> 48:53.080
to get the car down the ramp
and beat the skier?

48:55.330 --> 48:56.800
- No.
- Right.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.320
- Right.
- Then we have a huge problem.

48:58.410 --> 49:01.280
We need some more propulsion
'cause we can't use the engine

49:01.370 --> 49:03.960
because that will just
spin the wheels. Right.

49:04.050 --> 49:07.520
Also, we can't put a driver in it,
'cause obviously he'll be killed.

49:07.610 --> 49:10.560
So we're going to have to
work something out on steering.

49:10.650 --> 49:12.160
- That can be your job, okay?
- Okay.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.400
There's another problem. Once it's set off,
we've got to stop it at some point,

49:15.490 --> 49:18.960
otherwise it will just soar over there
and take out Lillehammer.

49:19.050 --> 49:21.510
So I'll work out a way of stopping it.

49:21.610 --> 49:23.760
- Right, guidance for you...
- Stopping.

49:23.850 --> 49:27.730
Braking for you and then
I'll figure out some way of...

49:27.810 --> 49:29.160
- Power.
- Power.

49:29.250 --> 49:30.960
Power, yes. I'll do the power.

49:31.050 --> 49:34.120
Let's get about our business.
I'll take my tea.

49:34.210 --> 49:37.440
Earl Grey in Norway.
Whoever would have thought it, huh?

49:38.890 --> 49:42.480
JEREMY: Our first job was to mark the point
where the skier had landed

49:42.570 --> 49:44.720
so we knew the distance to beat.

49:46.090 --> 49:49.970
Unfortunately, James was no
Sir Edmund Hilary.

49:50.050 --> 49:52.280
You got to spray paint it across.

49:53.330 --> 49:54.360
There you go. I've done it.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.800
No, you've got to get it across,
the whole way.

49:56.890 --> 49:59.080
- No, that'll do.
- It won't do.

50:04.050 --> 50:05.370
Shut up.

50:21.370 --> 50:22.960
How hard can it be?

50:24.130 --> 50:28.760
With James proving his own laws of gravity,
I got on with the business of power.

50:29.770 --> 50:32.960
Hi, is that the
United Kingdom Rocketry Association?

50:33.850 --> 50:36.440
Yeah. It's Jeremy Clarkson here
from Top Gear

50:36.530 --> 50:38.400
and I need some rockets.

50:39.610 --> 50:43.680
Soon, though, it went dark again.
So we went to the pub.

50:45.610 --> 50:46.960
- Nice to meet you.
- Damien.

50:47.050 --> 50:49.000
The next morning, the rocketeers arrived

50:49.090 --> 50:50.810
and announced that
they could give the Mini

50:50.890 --> 50:53.280
twice as much thrust, pound for pound,

50:53.370 --> 50:55.680
than an F-15 jet fighter.

50:55.970 --> 50:57.450
I've taken drag,

50:57.530 --> 51:00.680
aerodynamic drag, ski friction, gravity

51:00.810 --> 51:03.400
and the thrust of three
contrail hybrid rocket motors into it.

51:03.490 --> 51:05.880
- This is rocket science.
- This is rocket science.

51:05.970 --> 51:07.770
JEREMY: But then I saw the rockets.

51:07.850 --> 51:10.410
I can buy these from post offices
in November.

51:10.490 --> 51:12.000
You just wait until you're up there.

51:12.090 --> 51:14.200
- Are these really gonna give enough thrust?
- They are.

51:14.290 --> 51:16.680
More thrust than you can handle.

51:16.770 --> 51:20.730
- And so where? We put them here?
- No. Come on, Jeremy. That way round.

51:20.810 --> 51:23.370
Down here somewhere. Take the boot out.
Take the back out.

51:23.450 --> 51:25.720
- Yeah.
- Rip that off. Rip that off.

51:25.810 --> 51:27.690
Let's have a boot full.

51:27.770 --> 51:31.440
Meanwhile, I'd chosen a spot
to build my snow barrier.

51:31.530 --> 51:33.250
I think about here.

51:34.330 --> 51:35.360
Or here.

51:35.970 --> 51:36.960
No.

51:38.290 --> 51:39.360
I think...

51:44.290 --> 51:45.400
Right.

51:46.330 --> 51:47.440
(EXCLAIMS)

51:50.650 --> 51:53.560
How fast was the skier going
when he left the thing?

51:53.650 --> 51:54.970
MAN: 56 miles an hour.

51:55.050 --> 51:57.800
We're going to be going 83 miles an hour.

51:57.890 --> 52:00.360
This meant Hammond had to think big.

52:02.450 --> 52:04.840
Richard Hammond,
how's the braking going?

52:04.930 --> 52:07.120
Yeah, it's going well. It's going well.

52:08.010 --> 52:12.000
JEREMY: By this stage, Spider-Man
had finally got to the top of the ski jump.

52:12.530 --> 52:16.520
When the skier goes down, how does he...
How does he...

52:17.970 --> 52:20.090
How does he stay in the middle?

52:20.170 --> 52:23.050
- Oh, it has tracks.
- Grooves.

52:23.770 --> 52:25.410
- Liquid nitrous oxide.
- Yeah.

52:25.490 --> 52:27.160
- And that's got all the oxygen in it.
- Yeah.

52:27.250 --> 52:30.530
Yeah. And in the bottom end,
fuel, which is rubber.

52:30.610 --> 52:32.730
Don't... Here's a tip.

52:33.210 --> 52:35.640
Please, I'm a doctor of engineering, twice.

52:35.730 --> 52:37.930
If you use rubber as fuel,

52:38.010 --> 52:42.050
you're not going to go as far as
if you use, like, petrol or dynamite.

52:42.130 --> 52:45.920
Hey, Jeremy, do you think
you could mount it on skis?

52:48.210 --> 52:49.440
Why does he want skis?

52:49.530 --> 52:52.280
Just trust me. If you put it on the skis,
I can keep it dead straight.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.960
- We'll have to make them.
- Well, yes.

52:55.050 --> 52:57.640
Obviously. We can't go
to a ski rental shop and say,

52:57.730 --> 52:59.560
"Have you got some skis for a Mini?"

53:03.730 --> 53:06.480
James, the track is 1300 millimetres.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.440
RICHARD: And with those measurements,

53:09.530 --> 53:12.410
the icemen could now
cut their special grooves.

53:21.130 --> 53:22.530
Oh, yes.

53:24.530 --> 53:28.050
If I lose it now, I'm going to end up
in the Lillehammer ASDA.

53:29.890 --> 53:31.530
I'd love a decent tea.

53:31.730 --> 53:34.640
JEREMY: The rocket scientists have found
a job for me to do.

53:34.730 --> 53:37.170
- Does anyone want Earl Grey?
- ALL: No!

53:38.690 --> 53:42.130
With my skis fitted, the rockets installed,

53:42.210 --> 53:44.730
and the ice grooves coming along nicely,

53:46.290 --> 53:50.330
James and I dropped in on Hammond
to inspect his snow bank.

53:51.210 --> 53:53.810
I can guarantee that won't stop the Mini.

53:54.730 --> 53:57.720
Partly because it's not substantial enough,

53:57.810 --> 54:01.800
but mostly because you've built that
in front of that slope,

54:01.890 --> 54:04.880
and the Mini is coming down that one.

54:05.610 --> 54:06.600
Right.

54:08.050 --> 54:10.490
- Righto.
- JEREMY: What a complete...

54:12.210 --> 54:13.880
Some adjustments.

54:13.970 --> 54:15.410
Did nobody tell you?

54:15.490 --> 54:19.370
No, obviously!
Or I'd have built it over there!

54:20.610 --> 54:22.730
That is fairly embarrassing.

54:22.810 --> 54:25.850
What I need is a big machine.

54:28.410 --> 54:31.320
RICHARD: So I got myself a piste basher.

54:36.130 --> 54:40.210
With this, I am going to construct
something that will rival the Hoover Dam.

54:40.530 --> 54:43.330
Those two muppets
will not be laughing at me now.

54:43.490 --> 54:47.610
And to speed things up,
I even drafted in a herd of tractors.

54:53.450 --> 54:56.810
JEREMY: While Phillip Schofield was
building the great wall of Lillehammer...

54:56.890 --> 54:58.010
Oh, yeah.

55:00.730 --> 55:04.970
...the rocket car, primed with
one and a half tonnes of explosive thrust,

55:05.050 --> 55:08.330
began its long journey
to the top of the jump.

55:11.530 --> 55:15.970
And half an hour later, the ice grooves
were ready for Chris Bonington's approval.

55:16.050 --> 55:17.730
- I'm not...
- Please don't come near me.

55:17.810 --> 55:20.200
- I'm not touching you. I'm not...
- Go over there.

55:20.290 --> 55:22.410
- I'm nowhere near you.
- That's really nice.

55:33.050 --> 55:34.330
JAMES: This has never been done before.

55:34.410 --> 55:37.720
No. We are in fact at the cutting edge
of cocking about.

55:40.570 --> 55:43.610
JEREMY: The time for cocking about,
however, was over.

55:44.170 --> 55:47.610
The wall was finished,
the target was laid down,

55:47.690 --> 55:52.010
sort of, and we were now
in the hands of the rocket men.

55:54.490 --> 55:56.560
They're filling the rockets with fuel.

55:56.650 --> 55:58.450
We need to get that maximum
emission down.

55:58.530 --> 55:59.930
Straight away, yeah.

56:00.010 --> 56:01.770
RICHARD: It's going to be
an appalling mess.

56:01.850 --> 56:04.000
An explosion. An explosion.
A burning Mini...

56:04.090 --> 56:06.010
- Carnage.
...coming down on its roof.

56:06.090 --> 56:10.290
Venting. Red, white, blue.

56:10.370 --> 56:12.010
- Confirm.
- Confirm venting.

56:12.850 --> 56:16.560
And in three, two, one, purge.

56:17.130 --> 56:18.250
Come on, Mini!

56:18.810 --> 56:23.490
Armed. Five, four, three, two,

56:23.610 --> 56:25.330
one. Initiate.

56:40.290 --> 56:41.440
(ALL CHEERING)

56:43.130 --> 56:44.730
The wall's going to be needed!

56:45.900 --> 56:47.410
(ALL LAUGHING)

56:48.660 --> 56:51.650
- We were a bit short.
- We didn't beat the ski jumper.

56:51.740 --> 56:53.330
How well did it ski?

56:59.940 --> 57:02.090
JEREMY: It's brilliant skiing!

57:06.300 --> 57:10.000
I'm satisfied with that
and anyway, that's it, I have to go.

57:10.100 --> 57:12.090
I have to go back
to the world of daytime telly.

57:12.180 --> 57:14.850
- Boys, it's been a joy. Goodbye.
- It's been great having you here.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.690
- Thanks for coming.
- That was quite something.

57:16.780 --> 57:17.810
Bye.

57:17.900 --> 57:20.770
Actually, we can go anyway
'cause it's the end of the show.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.360
No, it isn't. There's one more thing.

57:26.620 --> 57:28.250
This is a snowmobile.

57:28.340 --> 57:30.930
It's a sort of Jet Ski
with a tank track on the back,

57:31.020 --> 57:32.930
and it's used for herding mooses

57:33.940 --> 57:37.490
and generally larking about.
But here's the thing.

57:37.860 --> 57:40.290
No one in the whole of human history

57:40.380 --> 57:43.370
has ever attempted
to ride one of these things

57:43.500 --> 57:44.850
down a ski jump.

57:46.780 --> 57:49.340
Now the reason why no one has ever
ridden a snowmobile

57:49.420 --> 57:51.170
down a ski jump like that,

57:51.260 --> 57:54.130
is the same reason we didn't put
anyone in the Mini last night.

57:54.220 --> 57:56.490
Yes, 'cause you'd probably
be killed to death.

57:56.580 --> 57:58.060
Yeah, very good chance of that.

57:58.140 --> 58:01.770
Luckily, however,
we know a man who has no fear.

58:01.860 --> 58:05.050
You thought we'd forgotten him,
but he's here. The Stig.

58:16.580 --> 58:20.410
It's the landing I think
I'm worried about most of all. His pods.

58:41.060 --> 58:43.090
And on that bombshell,

58:43.860 --> 58:45.530
or as he would now put it,

58:45.620 --> 58:47.850
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE) "On that bombshell",

58:47.940 --> 58:49.290
time to end the show.

58:49.380 --> 58:51.370
Thanks very much for watching. Good night!
