00:01.918 --> 00:05.255
And this, Lawrence,
is the teachers' lounge.

00:05.797 --> 00:06.798
I can't do it.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.092
The teachers' lounge is off limits.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.260
Come on.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.012
You're writing a biography on me.

00:13.304 --> 00:19.394
That means you get an all-access pass
to the life of one Dewey Alejandro Finn.

00:20.770 --> 00:21.771
Alejandro?

00:21.896 --> 00:22.897
Veridad.

00:24.649 --> 00:27.652
And I'm honoured you chose me as your hero
to biogra-fy.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.862
You assigned me you.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.071
Still an honour.

00:32.615 --> 00:35.285
Hey, L Train. Just be careful in here.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.079
I've managed to break a coffeemaker,
the trophy case,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.582
and a sign that read "Careful,
Trophy Case Fragile."

00:41.583 --> 00:43.334
-That's some bad luck.
-Right?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.253
Which is why we need
to not break anything else.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.756
I don't want to be
on Principal Mullins's radar.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.175
Maybe you should break her radar, too.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.219

His biographer remarked wittily.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.304
[chuckling]

00:55.013 --> 00:56.014
Now, you need to know that

00:56.097 --> 01:00.518
I invented one of the great
culinary achievements of our generation.

01:03.063 --> 01:06.858
Senor Dewey's Monster Burrito.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.527
[in Spanish accent]
She is surprisingly beautiful, no?

01:10.820 --> 01:13.156
More surprising,
you keep burritos in your jacket.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.741
Oh! Which reminds me.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.077
My homemade hot sauce.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.662
The burrito is an excellent source

01:19.746 --> 01:21.623
of calories after a night of hard rockin'.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.707
Are you getting this down?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.083
I'm getting the important stuff.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.503
Keeps hot sauce in pants.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.587
[Dewey] Mmm.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.882
Okay, in there, and...

01:31.674 --> 01:33.426
Now we wait for the microwave

01:33.510 --> 01:36.763
to melt the burrito
into a satisfying brown log.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.723
[microwave popping]

01:38.807 --> 01:40.099
[electricity crackling]

01:40.892 --> 01:41.976
Is that noise normal?

01:42.101 --> 01:43.895
Those are just flavour explosions.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.147
-[popping sounds]
-[electricity crackling]

01:46.439 --> 01:48.733
That really doesn't sound good!

01:48.942 --> 01:49.943
[Dewey] Yeah.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.779
You're only supposed
to hear those noises after you eat it.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.825
And that is our state-of-the-art
infirmary.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.911
Our safety record is second to none.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.746

[both] Whoa.

02:14.717 --> 02:15.885
Any questions?

02:19.264 --> 02:20.473
How did this happen?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.228
"Do not use microwave."

02:25.812 --> 02:27.605
Do you think they meant this microwave?

I just said "hmm."

03:30.001 --> 03:32.253
Which I know means you're thinking
about asking Freddy

03:32.337 --> 03:33.338
to move into your locker.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.424
Well, originally,
I planned on borrowing a few items

03:36.507 --> 03:38.509
of Freddy's every week
and putting them into my locker.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.554
So after a few months, he'd be moved in
without even realizing it.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.474
Wait a minute. That's how we met.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.559
Is it?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.897
Whatever.
A good romance tactician takes advantage

03:50.980 --> 03:53.524

Wow, sharing a locker is a big step.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.572
Next you'll be mashing up your names
the way celebrity couples do.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.115
Like Suddy or Summy.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.408
It's Fremmer.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.328
I even made his and her T-shirts.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.081
Oh, great.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.374
I even made you one.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.167
Oh, even better.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.633
Mr. Finn, I appreciate your help
in apprehending the culprit

04:18.716 --> 04:19.842
who blew up the microwave.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.136
I love apprehending culprits.
It's what I do.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.388
I never give up.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.931
I give up.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.685
I guess we'll never know
whose fault it was, Principal Mullins.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.229
Mr. Finn, that explosion cost me the wall.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.522
-Mmm.
-The microwave.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.358
I'm gonna wake up tonight screaming
"Beans!"

04:36.150 --> 04:37.151
I wanna know who did this.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.320
I did notice that the sticker
that said not

04:39.404 --> 04:40.989
to use the microwave had fallen off.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.658
So whoever it was-- and again,
we'll never know who it was--

04:44.659 --> 04:46.119
it wasn't really their fault.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.462
Tasting for clues.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.973
I couldn't help but notice
you're having a little locker trouble.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.349
Just a little.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.602
So if I were to ask you
to share my locker,

05:11.686 --> 05:13.062
what would you say?

05:13.271 --> 05:14.689
-I'd say yes!
-[shrieking]

05:16.733 --> 05:17.859

or suspicious behaviour.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.622
Nothing so far.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.130
To make Freddy feel more at home,
I'm thinking of painting the inside

05:39.213 --> 05:41.049
of my locker green so it's not
so feminine.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.968
What about that big cat doll
that takes up most of your locker?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.386
Princess Kitty stays!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.931
Of course she stays. She's a princess.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.560
Oh, Tomiks, I'm so excited.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.480
My life is so on point.
I've got the best BFF,

05:55.563 --> 05:58.858
the best grades, and the most perfect boy
to be my locker-mate.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.403
I'm happy for you,
but Freddy isn't perfect.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.865
[angelic choir singing]

06:05.948 --> 06:06.949
You may have a point.

For the last time, you chorus kids,
get out of the hall!

06:12.705 --> 06:13.748
Now shoo!

06:14.707 --> 06:16.542
And stop playing with the stage lights.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.797
Tell me exactly how it went down.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.882
-Every detail.
-[summer giggling]

06:22.965 --> 06:25.384
So, I walk up to him with energy,
but not too much energy.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.136
About seven steps per 10 seconds.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.930
-And my hair was parted--
-Okay, no details.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.349
Get to the Freddy part.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.059
So, I say,

06:33.351 --> 06:36.854
"So if I were to ask you
to share my locker, what would you say?"

06:37.730 --> 06:38.773
And he said?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.318
"I would say... yes."

06:43.486 --> 06:45.154
That's so great! He would say yes!

06:46.322 --> 06:49.033
Wait a minute. He would say yes.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.035
But that's not the same thing
as actually saying yes.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.370
Oh no, I didn't actually ask him!

06:52.453 --> 06:53.454
Don't freak out!

06:53.704 --> 06:55.456
I am sure Freddy understood.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.625
How could he not? Look.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.128
Hey, Lawrence.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.172
If I asked you to share my locker,
what would you say?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.549
I would say sure.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.716
And you understand from that

07:05.800 --> 07:07.969
-question that now we're locker-mates.
-Right.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.564
Hey, Lawrence.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.982
Will you hold my history report for a sec?

07:21.065 --> 07:22.150
Uh, sure.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.153
Hey, Esme, what does it mean
when someone asks someone else

07:25.236 --> 07:26.279
to move into their locker?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.489
It means that person really likes you.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.574
It does?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.576
Yeah. It means you're a real couple.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.830
Like, officially. Why?

07:37.081 --> 07:38.082
[gasping]

07:38.166 --> 07:40.042
Are you asking me
to share my locker with you?

07:40.209 --> 07:42.170
Uh, uh, yes, yes!

07:42.253 --> 07:43.880
Of course that's what I'm doing.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.840
Why else would I bring it up?

07:46.340 --> 07:47.925
Not because I'm sharing a locker
with anyone else.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.135
That would hurt your feelings.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.970
I'd be devastated.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.055
And if I backed out
of a promise like that,

07:53.139 --> 07:54.390
it would probably hurt, too?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.475
A lot.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.767
Then we're good!

08:04.108 --> 08:05.485
You just have to talk to Freddy again.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.279
I can't do it twice, because then,
I will look like a nut job!

08:08.362 --> 08:09.780

08:10.698 --> 08:12.200
And we wouldn't want that.

to clear things up?

Write this down.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.383
Well, we've searched every inch
of this place.

09:10.466 --> 09:14.887
And the only thing we've turned up is
Mr. Waladarsky's nose hair clippers.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.265
By the way, finders keepers.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.892
That's why I've called in a specialist.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.269
Here's the fingerprint kit.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.437
[Dewey] Clark?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.481
Since when do schools
have fingerprint kits?

09:25.731 --> 09:26.857
Oh, I brought this from home.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.818
It's part of my Junior Funbuster Pack.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.529
Aren't you a treat?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.990
Good idea. Now start dusting for prints.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.324
Uh...

09:36.075 --> 09:38.244
Why don't you make sure, first, here...

09:38.536 --> 09:40.288
Probably want to test these buttons here.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.372
Mr. Finn, stop!

You're contaminating the crime scene.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.293
[Dewey groaning] Sorry.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.045
I guess you'll just have
to eliminate my fingerprints,

09:48.129 --> 09:49.380
and then you got your perp.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.926
Huh. That looks suspicious.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.553
Oh, that?

09:56.512 --> 09:59.056
That's... just my energy drink.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.062
[guzzling]

10:06.439 --> 10:07.648
[gasping] There, that's better.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.612

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:21.329 --> 10:22.330
[Zack] Okay.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.333
Remember, Murph.
You're not just selling drones.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.793
You're selling dreams. About drones.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.337
Drone dreams.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.297
And don't get caught by Principal Mullins.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.381
Got it.

10:32.798 --> 10:33.883
Who's Principal Mullins?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.553
-She's the principal of our school.
-Got it.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.096
-[Freddy] What's going on?
-[Zack sighing]

10:39.180 --> 10:41.390
My protégé Murph
and I are using my locker as a new outlet

10:41.474 --> 10:42.558
for my drone business.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.686
And it's all possible thanks
to Summer asking me to share her locker.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.688
Wait, Summer asked you
to share her locker?

10:47.855 --> 10:49.565
Yeah. She sent me an official note.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.695
Huh, that's weird.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.115
I thought she asked me, but I guess not.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.661
Once you go Zack, you never go back.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.085
Well, I'm here to move into your locker,
as promised.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.921
What? Oh.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.966
Well, listen, Larry,
when I asked you to move into my locker,

11:16.050 --> 11:18.052
I was really-- what are those?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.679
Locker treats. Brownies, cookies, pie.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.391
My mom makes a huge container
of them every day.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.976
Oh,
it probably doesn't fit in your locker.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.312
How rude. Sorry it didn't work out.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.231
Wait, wait, locker treats?

11:30.815 --> 11:31.982
I'll make room.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.697
Welcome aboard, roomie!

11:41.826 --> 11:42.827
Hey, Kale.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.412
Namaste, Freddy.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.624
That means the spirit
in me acknowledges the spirit in you.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.960
So... hi?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.753
Yeah, hi.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.423
I'm setting up a campus recycling centre.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.091
Are you here to repurpose your books?

11:57.341 --> 11:59.093
Nah, they're still on the first purpose.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.555
My locker blew up,
so I have to carry these around.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.557
Okay, but enough of those books,

12:04.682 --> 12:06.058
and you can build a yurt for the homeless.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.478
That's nice that you care
about the homeless. And yurts.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.896
Whatever yurts are.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.774
I care about all kinds of things.

12:14.150 --> 12:18.070
I care about the planet, animals,
climate change, nuclear proliferation.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.613
You know, fun stuff.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.283
Wow. Impressive.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.326
I'm just trying to pass geometry.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.621
Hey, I also care about the locker-less.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.540
If you want, you can share mine.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.293
Assuming your books are not made
from animals or animal products.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.462
Yeah, I'd love to share your locker.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.464
And I'm pretty sure my books are made
of soy.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.466
[chuckling] I'll show you where it is.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.634
As soon as the recycling rush is over.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.929
[Kale humming]

12:44.472 --> 12:45.556
Okay, it's over.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.853
This whole locker thing is awful!

12:51.353 --> 12:52.855
[Summer sighing] Yeah.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.440
It's the worst.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.569
We have to find a way to get Zack out
and Freddy in.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.739
-I promise I'll handle it, no problem.
-[Summer chuckling]

13:02.114 --> 13:04.200
Uh oh, there might be a problem.

13:05.951 --> 13:06.952

13:09.246 --> 13:10.247
[Summer squeaking]

13:11.123 --> 13:13.417
[Summer screaming]

13:13.501 --> 13:15.503
[Summer] No, no, no!

13:15.586 --> 13:19.048
Remember, if you see anything strange,
you must alert me immediately.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.132
Still nothing.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.800
[Summer] No, no, no, no, no!

13:26.138 --> 13:30.226
Freddy and I were supposed
to be locked up, not Kale and Freddy.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.894
She's laughing my laughs.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.855
[laughing and snorting]

13:37.358 --> 13:39.443
You don't want those laughs.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.612
This is fun, huh?

13:41.779 --> 13:45.658
Us sharing a locker,
like I wouldn't do with anyone else,

13:45.783 --> 13:47.076
'cause you're my boo.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.453
-It is nice... boo.
-Ah!

13:51.247 --> 13:53.582
Oh, right, the other kind of boo.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.211
Is that Tomika's?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.963
Why would I have Tomika's textbook?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.923
Since I certainly don't share a locker
with her.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.302
It says Tomika on it.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.846
That's crazy. How could it happen?

14:08.055 --> 14:09.765
I for sure do not know.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.809
You must have got it mixed up.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.143
I'll just bring it back to her locker.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.395
No! I'll do it!

14:15.688 --> 14:20.776
I'm sorry being locker buddies is
so... so... complicated!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.156
It's not that complicated.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.953
So I store these recyclables
in my locker until pickup day on Thursday.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.497
Ah, man.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.249
Now there's not enough room 'cause
of my stuff.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.333
That's okay.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.296
I can carry this around on my head
with the grace indigenous women

14:40.379 --> 14:42.214
around the world display every day.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.800
[cans and bottles rattling]

14:45.217 --> 14:47.511
Ew, they're dripping, dripping!

14:49.597 --> 14:50.931
I don't want you to have to do that.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.182
Um, I'll take my stuff out.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.561
I will not let a little garbage juice
stop me from doing the right thing.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.147
Well,
at least let me carry the recyclables.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.858
Oh, Freddy, thank you so much.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.610
I'll go get the other bags.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.903
Other bags?

15:07.781 --> 15:10.576
So... how's sharing a locker with Kale?

15:10.659 --> 15:11.660
She's great.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.204
The garbage backpack, not so much.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.789
[garbage dripping]

15:15.956 --> 15:19.209
I mean, it was awesome of Kale to offer
to share her locker with me.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.296
But I'm actually worse off
than when I didn't have one.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.757
Being Summer's locker-mate is tough, too.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.176
She's got, like,
four stuffed animals in there.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.219
That must be tough.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.056
[coughing]

15:32.765 --> 15:34.725
That's the fifth fly I've swallowed today!

15:36.352 --> 15:39.021
On the upside,
the drone business is making bank.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.732
We're thinking of opening a second locker
in the south hall.

15:44.109 --> 15:49.073
Buddy, I can't watch you drag that trash
around the halls like a beaten man.

15:49.531 --> 15:50.532
I'm leaving.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.496

15:56.872 --> 15:58.040
I took your book by mistake.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.124
Ah. No big deal.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.918
I don't sweat the small stuff.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.921
Ah! Ants!

16:04.546 --> 16:06.215
Sometimes this happens with locker treats.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.301
But that's exactly why
I keep my pet tarantula around.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.054
Your what?

16:13.055 --> 16:14.723
He's been in there the whole time.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.642
He eats the ants when I set him loose.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.436
A tarantula? That's disgusting!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.897
Earl has a name, Tomika!

16:21.981 --> 16:22.982
It's Earl.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.986
And he's not disgusting. He's adorable.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.529
He's a little bite-y, though.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.368
Oh.

16:34.952 --> 16:35.953
He escaped.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.747
But don't be alarmed.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.709
There's only a slight chance he's nesting
in your hair.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.922

Where's my stuff?

17:07.818 --> 17:08.819
Oh.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.237
Yeah, your stuff, right.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.741
Um, so I had to move it to an empty locker
in the boys' locker room.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.951
The boys' locker room.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
Yeah,
I know it's not the most convenient place.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.248
But I really needed more space
for my drone business, which is epic.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.332
