00:01.320 --> 00:02.280
Who are you?

00:02.280 --> 00:04.160
Who are you?

00:04.160 --> 00:08.160
I'm afraid the best we can do is
stabilise your heart, I'm sorry.

00:08.680 --> 00:12.080
I feel bad about this, but you're
going to have to tell her again.

00:12.080 --> 00:12.720
We are not right for one another,
Victor.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.960
We are not right for one another,
Victor.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.000
We are not right for one another,
Victor.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.600
SCREAMS

00:18.600 --> 00:22.600
Take it easy!

00:23.320 --> 00:26.600
# Tito seco sopri...#

00:26.600 --> 00:28.320
Tonight, on St Elsewhere:

00:28.320 --> 00:31.040
Unless you really think
I raped those women, do you?

00:31.040 --> 00:32.520
Peter, I don't know who I believe.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.920
We can get a tour bus,
and a bar, and a hot tub,

00:35.920 --> 00:37.280
and we can drive to Vegas.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.400
I'd be better giving my patients
a whiskey and a bullet to bite on.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.320
Is it all like this?

00:41.320 --> 00:45.160
Is it all like this?

00:45.160 --> 00:48.760
I mean, it's a disgrace
for the entire hospital.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.760
(SHE SCREAMS)

02:29.720 --> 02:31.880
# The sound of it is really quite
atrocious

02:31.880 --> 02:35.160
# If you said loud enough
you almost sound precocious

02:35.160 --> 02:39.160
#
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. #

02:39.320 --> 02:42.920
Come on, Leticia, come on, Josh.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.080
# Because I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

02:46.080 --> 02:49.400
# My father gave my nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

02:49.400 --> 02:52.120
# But then one day I heard a word
that saved my aching nose

02:52.120 --> 02:55.800
# The biggest word you ever heard,
and this is how it goes

02:55.800 --> 02:59.800
# Oh,
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,

02:59.800 --> 03:02.960
# Even though the sound
of it is really quite atrocious

03:02.960 --> 03:06.320
# If you say it loud enough
and you'll really sound precocious

03:06.320 --> 03:10.320
# Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
#

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
APPLAUSE

03:16.200 --> 03:19.480
OK, does anybody here know
the song Bingo?

03:19.480 --> 03:21.320
CHILDREN: Yes

03:21.320 --> 03:22.600
Well, you want to sing it?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.640
CHILDREN: Yeah

03:23.640 --> 03:24.800
OK.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.800
# There was a farmer who had a dog,
and Bingo was his name, oh

03:29.160 --> 03:30.880
# B, I, N, G, O

03:30.880 --> 03:33.360
# B, I, N, G, O... #

03:33.360 --> 03:34.600
Hey, Luther.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.520
Hey, Dr Morrison, hey, Pete is
missing Mr Entertainment's show.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.680
He's at home with my brother, David.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.680
Your brother is visiting from
Seattle and you got him babysitting?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.880
Good night, Luther.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.760
# There was a farmer who had a dog
and Bingo was his name oh

03:51.760 --> 03:53.640
# B, I, N, G, O... #

03:53.640 --> 03:56.320
Dr Morrison, didn't you
say your brother was a cop?

03:56.320 --> 03:59.320
Yeah, I had an uncle who was
a sergeant with a BU campus police.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.680
Mr Moreland, hey, see later,
Dr Morrison, hey, I've got talk to.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.080
Mr Moreland, hey, see later,
Dr Morrison, hey, I've got talk to.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.360
Yeah, but this is really important.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.480
Yeah, but this is really important.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.280
when he's supposed to be working?
Well, I told him to wax Ward D.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.400
But Mr Moreland, listen,
this is an emergency,

04:13.400 --> 04:15.000
a boiler is about to explode.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.160
What? Are you crazy?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.880
No, I was just downstairs,
and it was hissing and clunking,

04:18.880 --> 04:20.640
and I'm sure it's going to blow.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.960
OK, I'll check it out,
but you go look for this clown.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.000
Mr Entertainment?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.240
Yeah, and you tell him
I want him to wax Ward D

04:27.240 --> 04:29.760
or I'll kick his bucket
out of this hospital.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.760
Yes, sir.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.040
So, I had him handcuffed
and in the back of the car

04:41.040 --> 04:42.960
before I realised
it was Paul Fenucci.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.120
Rita's brother?

04:44.120 --> 04:47.520
Lovely Rita.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.520
Must be weird arresting kids
we grew up with.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.000
You miss Seattle?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.280
I miss you, and Mum, Dad.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.280
Last month and I was back there,
it was like I'd never left.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.800
The house, our neighbourhood,
all the places he used to hang out.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.920
I thought how great it would be
for Pete to be able to grow up there.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.240
So, why not?

05:13.240 --> 05:16.720
I got back to Boston
and I realised...

05:16.720 --> 05:19.920
This is my home.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.320
At least for now.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.200
I like it here.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.640
I've got good
friends at the hospital.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.640
I've got good
friends at the hospital.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.800
Listen, why don't you see
if you can fly out on Monday,

05:32.800 --> 05:33.840
stay for the weekend?

05:33.840 --> 05:37.400
No, I've got to leave tomorrow,
I've got morning watch on Thursday.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.920
I wish I could have been
with you more.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.160
I wish I could have been
with you more.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.720
Pete got to spend more time with you.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.160
That reminds me,
I took Pete to Cambridge today,

05:44.160 --> 05:48.160
and I had something made up for him
at the coop.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.200
I suppose you got him
signed up for the Police Academy.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.480
Well, what do you want him
to be, a doctor?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.520
BABY CRIES

06:01.520 --> 06:05.520
Let me get it.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.920
Dr Martin, welcome back.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.520
He's been gone so long I was
beginning to think you've moved.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.680
Thank you for the time off.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.240
A little vacation?

06:40.240 --> 06:43.360
No, I had the flu,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.920
I don't usually get sick,
but this really knocked me out.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.200
Are you sure you didn't
come back too soon?

06:49.200 --> 06:49.960
You look a little tired.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.640
You look a little tired.

06:52.640 --> 06:56.640
Good.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.800
Oh!

07:02.800 --> 07:03.840
Cathy, are you all right?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.840
Cathy, are you all right?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.400
So, what time shall we have lunch?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.160
I can't, Phil,
I have a whirlpool patient at 11,

07:17.160 --> 07:19.320
and an ultrasound at 12.30.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.600
OK.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.680
Sorry.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.760
So, we're still on for this evening?

07:23.760 --> 07:24.800
Yeah.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.400
Yeah.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.840
Physical therapist, huh?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.040
Yes, Fiscus.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.720
Phil, you little slink, you,
getting a little PT on the side.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.400
I don't have to clear it with
personnel,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.160
because I'm in charge of the floor

07:38.160 --> 07:40.720
while Rosenthal has had breast
reconstruction.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.680
Look, Colette and Bettina
are supposed be working threes,

07:44.680 --> 07:46.480
that's where I want them.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.480
Jerk!

07:47.480 --> 07:49.880
Jerk!

07:49.880 --> 07:53.880
I don't care if you believe me or
not, my grandfather died.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.960
This is a smear campaign.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.960
OK, so, be sure to tell her,
I want you to assist.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.480
Hey, you, stop right there.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.200
Just who do you think you are?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.560
Do you think this is some
sort of country club?

08:24.560 --> 08:27.760
We don't rearrange schedules
so you can go to Utah

08:27.760 --> 08:29.720
and ski when you get the whim.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.520
I didn't go skiing, I went home
to my grandfather's funeral.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.320
You think I'm going to swallow
that old line of baloney?

08:36.320 --> 08:40.320
I don't care if you believe me
or not, my grandfather died.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.360
Hi, got your message.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.440
Is that a tape of your documentary?

08:51.440 --> 08:55.440
Dr Reckerwolf thought I might
like to see it before it aired.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.320
Thank God I did.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.800
News crew follows me around for days

08:59.800 --> 09:03.560
to document what it's like being a
surgeon, and they come up with this.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.720
I mean, this thing makes me
look like some sort of an ogre.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.400
It's a terrible distortion.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.840
Come on, it can't be that bad.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.840
You want a bet?

09:15.280 --> 09:18.760
There's a hole in the left
ventricle, Nurse Meade,

09:18.760 --> 09:22.760
have an aorta balloon standing by.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.480
What the hell is happening?

09:25.480 --> 09:28.040
His chest wall is tightening.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.080
His pupillary reflexes.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.960
What? I don't want him
regaining consciousness.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.680
It's getting kind of light.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.480
Stop blubbering,
I don't know why I bother with you.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.760
I'd be better off giving
my patients a shot of whiskey

09:40.760 --> 09:43.520
and a bullet to bite on.

09:43.520 --> 09:44.560
Mudslinging 101.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.600
Is it all like this?

09:45.600 --> 09:49.480
Well, it shows me barking out orders
and reprimanding residents,

09:49.480 --> 09:51.520
and frankly, Donald,
you look wooden.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.360
I mean, it's a disgrace
for the entire hospital.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.080
When are they going to air it?

09:55.080 --> 09:56.160
When are they going to air it?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.200
Boy.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.120
I mean, this sort of underhanded,
yellow journalism is a travesty.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.560
It shouldn't be allowed on the air.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.560
Good luck.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.440
His colleagues will tell you that
he's a brilliant surgeon,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.560
so will most of his patients,

10:16.560 --> 10:20.160
but they'll also tell you he's a
carping, cynical martinet,

10:20.160 --> 10:24.160
above all, they'll tell you
that Mark Craig is a prima donna.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.680
And do we really need
that in a doctor?

10:28.680 --> 10:31.840
Leech!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.520
Ma?

10:33.520 --> 10:35.960
Yes, Joseph.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.160
It's never been like this.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.680
Second time today.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.480
Dr Morrison, do something.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.120
BP is 90/65, respiration is shallow
and his heart rate is way up.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.760
Is my son dying?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.640
He needs an emergency coronary
operation.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.880
I'll check the board.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.760
Joe, you can't wait any longer,

10:52.760 --> 10:55.800
we want to perform the operation
I talked about.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.480
But you told me
the medicine you gave him...

10:58.480 --> 10:59.720
It's not working.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.080
Then something else, doctor?

11:01.080 --> 11:04.440
We have to remove the obstruction
blocking the blood to his brain.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.400
If we don't do it now,
he could suffer a stroke.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.160
This operation, you will do it?

11:09.160 --> 11:13.160
No, no,
Mrs Canelly, I'm not a surgeon.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.280
You must be there, doctor, please.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.760
Craig is on his way to RR two.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.240
Please.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.760
Can you cover for me
while I'm in surgery?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.440
Can you cover for me
while I'm in surgery?

11:24.440 --> 11:27.400
Mrs Ross, I've given her 2141,
can you check on her in an hour?

11:27.400 --> 11:31.400
Right.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.000
Hi, stranger, how you feeling?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.120
Much better.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.400
Mind if I join you?

11:40.400 --> 11:44.120
Jackie, Canelly is on his way
to surgery, I need his angiograms.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.320
I thought I gave that back.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.520
Nuh-uh.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.200
Jack, I've been looking for you.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.160
Why the hell are you going to visit
Peter White in jail?

11:52.160 --> 11:53.200
Why the hell are you going to visit
Peter White in jail?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.760
I have to live with the fact
that that guy tried to rape me,

11:55.760 --> 11:59.280
and who knows how many other women
before he was caught, let him rot.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.920
Peter is obviously very sick,
and he needs help.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.560
I'm not very concerned with
what he needs.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.760
I'm not very concerned with
what he needs.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.880
I wouldn't be much of a friend
if I abandoned him.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.720
I couldn't care less about anybody.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.760
I couldn't care less about anybody.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.040
Well, what the hell am I?

12:12.040 --> 12:13.000
Oh, Wendy.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Oh, Wendy.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.840
Here.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.760
Here.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.720
I think they should castrate
Peter White

12:24.720 --> 12:28.720
and then kill him.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.520
Wait a minute, you're telling me

12:34.520 --> 12:37.000
you have a gig performing
for terminal patients?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.840
I'm going to be late.
# You want to know a secret... #

12:39.840 --> 12:41.680
You've got to stop
singing on the time,

12:41.680 --> 12:44.320
otherwise orderlies going to
want your head on a platter.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.360
Mr Entertainment,
you've got to stop.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.800
Mr Entertainment,
you've got to stop.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.800
Well, at least turn it down, I mean,
do your work, then boogie,

12:50.960 --> 12:54.960
or else you're going to be fired.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.520
Are you serious?

12:56.520 --> 12:57.560
Yes.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.040
I can't afford to lose my job.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.840
Who can?

13:01.840 --> 13:03.920
I'll try to curb myself.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.720
Well, at least tone yourself down,

13:06.720 --> 13:09.280
just keep it out
of Moreland's sight.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.480
Understood.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.920
OK, thanks for the warning,

13:14.920 --> 13:17.920
if you ever need me,
just call out my name,

13:17.920 --> 13:18.560
and you know, wherever I am...

13:18.560 --> 13:22.560
and you know, wherever I am...

13:22.560 --> 13:24.320
Oh, that's something you
never told me.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.280
What's that?

13:25.280 --> 13:26.440
What's that?

13:26.440 --> 13:28.520
Justin.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.360
Oh, Justin.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.960
Justin Time.

13:33.960 --> 13:37.960
# Just in time I found you,
just in time... #

13:45.360 --> 13:48.400
So, Jack,
a little flight time in the OR?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.880
Ah, it's great, isn't it?

13:49.880 --> 13:52.800
Nothing like it in the world.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.600
I'm happy being an internist.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.640
Don't get defensive,

13:55.640 --> 13:58.200
if you ask me, it beats
looking down other people's throats,

13:58.200 --> 13:59.680
pushing on their groins.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.120
Right, Victor.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.000
Would you rather be in the trenches
where the rubber meets the road?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.680
I think you made a wrong
turn at med school, pal.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.560
I think you made a wrong
turn at med school, pal.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.840
Dr Craig.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.240
Out of the way, Ehrlich.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.240
Looking forward to
the documentary tonight, sir.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.120
Something happen in there?

14:20.120 --> 14:24.120
No, Canelly's operation went great.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.000
See you inside, Victor.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
See you inside, Victor.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.440
How are you feeling, Helen?

14:39.440 --> 14:43.440
How are you feeling, Helen?

14:43.960 --> 14:47.160
I'm not just being vain.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.480
You tell me, Helen.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.480
You see, the day before
I go to get my haircut,

14:53.600 --> 14:55.360
I look in the mirror

14:55.360 --> 14:59.360
and I think, well, maybe it's just
fine, maybe I should leave it alone.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.360
You know, right before I shaved
off my moustache,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.680
I felt the very same thing.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.680
And then after I did, I realised
it was the right thing to do.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.280
Dr Burkhart, he did an excellent
job on your mastectomy,

15:15.280 --> 15:19.280
he left plenty of skin for the
implant, you are going to look great.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.160
See you a couple of hours. OK, Vijay.

15:23.160 --> 15:27.160
Now that I'm finally here,

15:28.960 --> 15:31.480
see what you can do with my nose.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.480
Not on your life, Helen, I love
your nose, quit stalling.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.880
Let's go.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.720
I wouldn't be bothering
you like this, Doc,

15:43.720 --> 15:46.920
at the end of the day, but the
complaints are starting to pile up.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.560
Have you discussed this with
Mr Entertainment?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.920
Oh, yeah, I've done everything,
I've been lenient,

15:51.920 --> 15:53.680
and reasonable, I've been friendly.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.840
I don't want to fire this guy
but nothing works.

15:55.840 --> 15:57.880
It's a shame,
people seem to like him.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.080
Oh, sure, he's great.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.280
But popularity is not going
to get the floors mopped

16:01.280 --> 16:02.840
or the trash emptied.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.120
Do me a favour, one more chance?

16:06.120 --> 16:08.120
OK, Doc, you're in charge.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.320
Anything else in your mind?

16:09.320 --> 16:12.320
Yes, this hospital could save a
lot of money on fluorescent lights,

16:12.320 --> 16:15.480
if we just put two in each
fixture instead of four.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.320
Don't you think these hallways
are gloomy enough as it is?

16:18.320 --> 16:20.440
My thought is that we can just...

16:20.440 --> 16:23.880
SINGING

16:23.880 --> 16:27.880
# Di squallor il
suo tetto si copri... #

16:33.400 --> 16:34.680
Buena sera.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.120
And to you.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.280
What are you doing?

16:37.280 --> 16:41.280
I was trying out some new material,
would you care to listen?

16:41.400 --> 16:45.400
It's the part where Germont Senior
asks Violeta to leave Alfredo

16:46.200 --> 16:47.880
for the good of his sister's name.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.240
Ah, no, thanks.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.120
You're angry, I won't do it again.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.000
Have you finished replacing
the missing floor tiles

16:55.000 --> 16:56.560
in ward four like I told you?

16:56.560 --> 17:00.240
Not exactly, I had to
sing for Mrs Blaine's birthday.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.440
Oh, that's it, that's it,
you're through.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.440
Turn in your ID
and your pass keys and get out.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.480
Look, I didn't mean
to let anybody down.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.760
# There may be trouble ahead

17:14.760 --> 17:18.760
# But while there's moonlight
and music and love and romance... #

17:19.400 --> 17:20.720
You see what I mean?

17:20.720 --> 17:24.160
# Let's face the music and dance. #

17:24.160 --> 17:28.160
We'll be approaching the dissection
through the existing scar.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.920
How's Roberta?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.440
Urgh.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.040
Something wrong?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.600
Something wrong?

17:34.600 --> 17:37.640
Roberta left for Philly to think
and eat pate, no doubt.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.680
Scalpel.
Sorry things aren't working out.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.600
You're thinking of getting married,
right?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.000
Maybe this summer.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.080
Take my advice, buddy, don't.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.440
Suction here, please.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.840
I envy you, Dr Cauldwell,

17:49.840 --> 17:52.440
you can create the woman
of your wildest fantasies.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.040
Hand me a size A implant, Victor.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.320
One fun bag, coming up.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.080
One fun bag, coming up.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.080
Sorry.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.000
I'm putting the implant
underneath the pectoralis major,

18:03.000 --> 18:04.680
why is that, Dr Ehrlich?

18:04.680 --> 18:08.520
To guard against migration.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.080
It's too small, next size, please.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.640
Double your pleasure.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.840
What the hell's with you, Victor?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.120
I don't know,
maybe it's this thing with Roberta,

18:17.120 --> 18:18.720
lately I've been acting
like such a...

18:18.720 --> 18:20.720
lately I've been acting
like such a...

18:20.720 --> 18:24.040
Whenever I'm around a woman, I start
gawking out, acting like a jerk.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.280
Being rude, insensitive.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.920
Being rude, insensitive.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.080
Doesn't matter.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.920
Listen, if you're not up to this,
Dr Carlton can step in.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.080
I'm a doctor, a professional,
I'll do the job.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.360
Good. How is she, Vijay?

18:37.360 --> 18:41.360
Very well, her BP is 112/72.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.800
Bobby, I once was engaged to a girl
who could have used your services.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.360
Deviated septum.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.440
Deviated septum, stop it, Vijay,

18:49.440 --> 18:52.600
I saw the woman, she could have used
a basement to attic renovation.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.600
That's it, take off,
Victor, Carlton, get in here.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.880
Suction, here.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.360
First my personality, now my career.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.480
Vijay, that bad, huh?

19:12.480 --> 19:16.480
A real bow wow.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.880
He'll have to rest quietly for the
next few days, keep the head still.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.720
I'll make sure.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.000
No more attacks, right, Doc?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.680
Dr Craig and Dr Meldrum think so.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.040
You'll be able to get back to
work in about a week or so.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.440
Your neck's going
to be sore for a while.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.600
I guess it's worth it though,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.960
I know you've been looking
after the family.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.760
I didn't do anything special.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.320
Thanks, though.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.600
Doctor Morrison,
once the family is back home,

19:50.600 --> 19:53.720
will you come again for dinner?

19:53.720 --> 19:54.920
I'd like that very much.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.640
Oh, I don't want you just
saying that,

19:57.640 --> 20:01.240
you are welcome in our home
and to stay away would be very rude.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.640
He wouldn't want to be rude to Ma,
right, sis?

20:03.640 --> 20:05.920
No.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.480
How's Dominic?

20:07.480 --> 20:10.280
He's fine, he misses you.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.040
I miss him.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.800
This morning, he woke up,
I went into his room,

20:14.800 --> 20:17.960
he rolled over, he was
sitting up all by himself

20:17.960 --> 20:21.960
and he had this big smile on his
face, he was so proud of himself.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
LOUD ELECTRONIC MUSIC

21:21.400 --> 21:25.400
(SHE SCREAMS)

22:07.560 --> 22:10.760
OK, um, Motor Boy, maybe you can
start by telling me what happened

22:10.760 --> 22:13.720
right after you saw
the Generation X video.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.560
Or anything else that you feel
like talking about is all right too.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.200
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

22:17.200 --> 22:18.760
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

22:18.760 --> 22:21.720
Dr Ridley, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were with a patient.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.280
Oh, that's OK, actually,
our session is up.

22:24.280 --> 22:28.280
Well, same time tomorrow, all right?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.480
Good, OK.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.360
Well, I have to leave but you're
welcome to stay here,

22:33.360 --> 22:35.880
if you want to talk to me,
I'll be some place in the hospital,

22:35.880 --> 22:39.320
they can always find me.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.320
Oh, and before you leave,
don't forget to turn off the lights.

22:44.640 --> 22:48.120
It's about Mr Entertainment, he got
the axe and he's real depressed,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.560
and I was wondering, if you have the
time, can you talk to him?

22:50.560 --> 22:54.560
and I was wondering, if you have the
time, can you talk to him?

22:58.120 --> 22:59.880
Hi, Shirley.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.040
Hi, oh, Dr Murray is
waiting for her X-rays,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.520
she said they were here
but I can't find them.

23:05.520 --> 23:09.520
Oh, she's got us both down here.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.120
What the hell's the matter with me?

23:12.120 --> 23:13.960
What the hell's the matter with me?

23:13.960 --> 23:17.960
No, one of my patients...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.480
You once said that
I care about my patients

23:21.480 --> 23:23.880
more than anybody
else in the hospital.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.400
You do.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.400
Well, I'm beginning to think that
I do for all the wrong reasons.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.480
Selfish reasons.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.840
There's this family,
and I've been using them.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.480
Oh, what do you mean, using them?

23:37.480 --> 23:41.040
Last week, when I went back to
Seattle to stay with my parents,

23:41.040 --> 23:45.040
it was supposed to be
so they could take care of Pete.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.840
Actually, they wound up
taking care of me.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.520
Hey, free laundry and home cooked
meals, that's what families are for.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.080
I know.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.920
But it made me realise that
when I'm here, I don't have one.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.920
Well, you've got a pretty good
support group here at the hospital.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.840
Yeah, but it's not the same thing.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.840
Ah.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.800
I want to have a family again,
Shirley.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.920
There's nothing wrong with that.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.680
But I feel like I'm violating Nina.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.680
Come on, Jack, Nina's a hard woman
to replace, give yourself time.

24:23.440 --> 24:27.440
After she died...

24:30.280 --> 24:32.920
..I dreamed about her.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.920
These wonderful dreams where we
would talk, kiss,

24:41.040 --> 24:44.240
and play with Pete.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.240
And I couldn't wait to go to
sleep at night.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.240
It was like I could...

24:52.240 --> 24:55.080
I was with her.

24:55.080 --> 24:59.080
A few weeks ago when I started with
this family the dreams stopped.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.840
And as hard as I try...

25:03.840 --> 25:07.840
Jack.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.160
Oh.

25:17.160 --> 25:21.160
Oh.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.800
Parlot, Deborah L.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.960
Her family is coming in later today.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.960
Sure.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.120
Did you forget your keys?

25:32.120 --> 25:36.120
No, I have them.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.880
Jacqueline, don't go in there.

25:41.880 --> 25:42.440
What?

25:42.440 --> 25:43.480
What?

25:43.480 --> 25:44.240
Come on.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.240
Come on.

25:51.600 --> 25:55.400
Are you all right?

25:55.400 --> 25:58.600
No.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.600
The reason I was
gone for two weeks...

26:04.880 --> 26:08.880
Peter White raped me.

26:11.560 --> 26:15.400
Well, I worked at First Fidelity
Savings on Charles Street

26:15.400 --> 26:19.080
for six years,
for five years as a teller.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.360
And then I got promoted
to loan officer.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.680
That sounds like a good job.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.600
Oh, it was, for a while.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.600
People would come in
and ask for money to buy a car,

26:28.840 --> 26:31.360
or a boat, or a house,

26:31.360 --> 26:34.880
or ice cream castles in the air.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.880
And it made me feel really good,
helping them out.

26:39.480 --> 26:42.680
Only there were
a lot of poor people too.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.840
And I couldn't do a thing
to help them.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.680
You see, I couldn't help the people
who needed it the most.

26:47.680 --> 26:50.400
So, you quit?

26:50.400 --> 26:53.400
No.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.920
Um...

26:54.920 --> 26:58.480
One day, a young couple came
to my desk to refinance a loan

26:58.480 --> 27:00.960
that I'd given them on a house
in Somerville,

27:00.960 --> 27:04.360
and they didn't qualify.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.240
But I fudged the figures
and loaned them the money anyway.

27:08.240 --> 27:12.240
And I was found out, and, um, fired.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.280
Well, we've all done things in
our life that have embarrassed us,

27:16.280 --> 27:20.280
but I think what you did at the bank
came from basic altruism.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.680
Really?

27:21.680 --> 27:24.600
Really?

27:24.600 --> 27:26.640
Well, I'm happy now.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.760
In your job, obviously you're not.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.840
I mean, you're over qualified
and you're bored,

27:30.840 --> 27:34.840
and that's why you sing
and don't work.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.000
I've been fired from every
job I've ever had.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.440
So, then,
it's never been your choice?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.720
All right.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.720
What if, you took control of your
life, and did with it what you want?

27:54.720 --> 27:58.720
I can see clearly now,
the rain has gone.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.440
OK, OK.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.080
Let's have a fresh start, all right?

28:04.080 --> 28:06.840
Now, my name is Michael Ridley,
what's yours?

28:06.840 --> 28:09.720
What's your real name?

28:09.720 --> 28:10.920
My name's Bob.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.720
Bob.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.320
Bob Moran.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.160
# Ba-ba-ba-ba-Bob Moran

28:19.160 --> 28:23.160
# Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba Bob Moran... #

28:24.880 --> 28:28.880
OK, wow, let me get this straight,
you don't like the documentary.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.680
It's garbage.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.480
I'm devastated.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.800
Everyone here at the station
feels like this is my best work.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.000
The production value
was of the highest quality,

28:41.000 --> 28:42.240
the script was moving.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.640
Don't give me that crap.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.640
Can I get you some coffee?

28:45.640 --> 28:48.040
This tape is a sham.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.880
And you're a disgrace
to your profession.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.240
OK, what is it exactly that you
don't like about the documentary?

28:55.240 --> 28:57.800
You told only half the story.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.600
You know, when I agreed to do this,

28:59.600 --> 29:01.440
it was an act of good faith
on my part.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.440
But you portrayed me and my
colleagues as insensitive mechanics.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.720
Celluloid doesn't lie, Dr Craig.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.680
Now, if this documentary shows
you in an unflattering light,

29:12.680 --> 29:15.880
I suggest you take another look
at yourself and not blame the film.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.800
I'll tell you what I'm going to do,
buddy boy,

29:17.800 --> 29:21.800
I'm going to haul you and your whole
fly by night operation in to court.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.840
For what?

29:23.840 --> 29:25.000
Slander.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.920
Well, we've got something on our side
called freedom of the press.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.920
Look, I have a friend who's a judge,

29:32.120 --> 29:33.800
I'm going to get an injunction

29:33.800 --> 29:37.320
stopping you from airing this
monstrosity tonight.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.920
Doctors are something else.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.920
You want people to think you're God.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.040
The moment we pull back the curtain

29:44.040 --> 29:47.120
and find nothing but intimidating
tactics, you scream foul,

29:47.120 --> 29:50.000
well, it's not going
to work this time, Dr Craig.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.080
We shot it,
now we're going to air it.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.360
I'd think twice if I were you.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.960
Oh, is that a threat?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.480
You bet it is.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.120
I'll see you in court.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.560
What's in there?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.120
I cleared out my locker.

30:04.120 --> 30:04.680
You're not depressed?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.840
You're not depressed?

30:06.840 --> 30:09.120
I've got to do what
I want to do now,

30:09.120 --> 30:12.040
take my shot at becoming
a shining star.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.480
I mean,
no more singing in the stairwells,

30:15.480 --> 30:17.520
I'm headed for the big time now.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.240
It's going to be casinos
and casinos in nightclubs.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
Wait a minute,
if you're looking to make a move,

30:22.240 --> 30:24.160
you're talking to the right guy.

30:24.160 --> 30:24.920
Really?

30:24.920 --> 30:27.600
Really?

30:27.600 --> 30:30.880
I could have you performing on stage
tonight by ten o'clock.

30:30.880 --> 30:31.480
Have another dream on me.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.480
Have another dream on me.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.960
called Kansas City Bar and Grill,

30:35.960 --> 30:39.280
and every Wednesday night they
have this amateur talent contest,

30:39.280 --> 30:39.880
and you know what they say?

30:39.880 --> 30:40.920
and you know what they say?

30:40.920 --> 30:42.320
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.360
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.400
And if you win, you get ¤100.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.080
Zippidydoodah.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.120
You know what, this could be the
start of a whole new life for us,

30:50.120 --> 30:51.360
I can see it now,

30:51.360 --> 30:54.880
we can get a tour bus, and a bar,
and a hot tub,

30:54.880 --> 30:56.960
and we could drive to Vegas,

30:56.960 --> 31:00.960
you and me and Buddy Hackett
playing black jack at the Sands.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.320
You do play black jack, don't you?

31:03.320 --> 31:06.760
Well, I played whist once
while I worked.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.520
Anyway, you'll be performing before
thousands of adoring

31:10.520 --> 31:12.640
and paying fans.

31:12.640 --> 31:16.640
Well?

31:17.960 --> 31:21.960
I'm going to Kansas City.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.360
Kansas city, here I come.

31:25.360 --> 31:28.440
# They got some crazy
little women there

31:28.440 --> 31:30.920
# And I'm a going to get me one. #

31:30.920 --> 31:32.160
Yeah, you're an animal,

31:32.160 --> 31:35.040
I'm going to meet you in the lobby,
eight o'clock.

31:35.040 --> 31:39.040
Dress to impress.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.720
How you doing?

31:47.720 --> 31:51.720
I'm OK.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.280
What happened?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.800
Uh, one of my cell mates had
an acid flashback

31:57.800 --> 32:01.800
and decided to try to make me
part of it.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.600
I wanted to say all these things.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.840
Don't worry about it.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.680
I'm just glad you came.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.040
You know Myra hasn't
even been to see me.

32:17.040 --> 32:20.320
Yeah, I think she's afraid.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.640
Does she really think I'm capable
of doing what they accuse me of?

32:23.640 --> 32:27.640
Does she really think
I raped those women?

32:28.080 --> 32:32.080
Do you?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.720
Jack?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.360
Wendy says you attacked her.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.360
Well, Wendy has always had
it in for me, and you know it.

32:40.760 --> 32:44.080
The weird thing is, I went in there
to try and make friends with her.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.760
I don't know, she took it the wrong
way, she started screaming,

32:46.760 --> 32:49.160
the next thing I know,
Fiscus jumps on me.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.360
I didn't do anything wrong, Jack.
You've got to believe me.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.240
Peter, I don't know who to believe.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.160
I've got a wife and kids.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.160
I've got problems, I admit it,
but I'm not a monster.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.560
They're trying to pin those
other rapes on me.

33:05.560 --> 33:09.560
It's just like the entrapment case.

33:09.920 --> 33:13.920
Can I do anything for you?

33:14.400 --> 33:18.400
Get me out of here.

33:30.840 --> 33:33.960
MUSIC PLAYS

33:33.960 --> 33:37.680
SHOUTS FROM AUDIENCE

33:37.680 --> 33:40.560
You're going out there a nobody
and you're coming back a superstar.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.920
Michael Jackson, move over.

33:41.920 --> 33:44.280
The audience seems to like
the act that's out there now.

33:44.280 --> 33:48.280
Mr, trust me, that's strictly
from hunger, tonight is our night.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.160
Tonight you're mine completely,
you give your love so sweetly.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.680
But will you love me tomorrow?

33:56.680 --> 33:59.440
OK, I'm going down the front,
remember one thing,

33:59.440 --> 34:03.400
your people, your fans, your crowd,
and your public.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.400
Mr Entertainment, don't let us down.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.920
TRUMPETS PLAY

34:17.719 --> 34:21.719
APPLAUSE

34:25.480 --> 34:26.080
OK.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.719
OK.

34:27.719 --> 34:31.719
This is it,
I'm taking control of my life,

34:32.520 --> 34:36.520
I'm being who I want to be,
I'm doing what I want to do.

34:37.480 --> 34:41.480
And I'm going where I want to go.

34:44.679 --> 34:48.679
I know, but I'm the one that...

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Right.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.360
Yeah, right.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.000
I understand.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
All right, thank you,
I'll see you next week, good night.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.800
Who's that?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.520
My ex-friend, Judge Farnham.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.640
Oh, Mark.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.560
No, I'm serious, I wait around all
day for him to return my call,

35:08.560 --> 35:11.840
and when he finally does,
I don't get any results.

35:11.840 --> 35:15.120
I take it he's not able to stop them
from airing the programme.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.400
According to Farnham,
it has to air first,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.680
and then we have to try
and sue them.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.200
Although, even so, he doesn't think
we have a legal leg to stand on.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.760
I think the ones you've
got are pretty cute.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.680
For Pete's sake, Ellen,
this is serious.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.760
Sweetheart, I think you're blowing
this way out of proportion.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.760
Once it's aired, it's too late,
the damage is already done.

35:35.720 --> 35:38.960
Spent a quarter of a century
building my reputation,

35:38.960 --> 35:42.960
only to have some myopic, two-bit
director start chipping away at it.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.320
While I stand by and watch?

35:45.320 --> 35:48.560
'This is St Eligius
Hospital, originally built as...'

35:48.560 --> 35:51.800
I'm going for a drink.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.560
'..it has since undergone
extensive renovations,

35:54.560 --> 35:58.560
'and in the late
'40s became a public hospital.'

35:59.480 --> 36:03.480
You know, when I was in recovery,
I had this hallucination,

36:03.640 --> 36:07.240
you taking off the dressing, and
the bandages just kept unravelling

36:07.240 --> 36:09.720
and unravelling
and I kept telling you to hurry up,

36:09.720 --> 36:13.000
but the more you tried to hurry,
the more they unravelled.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
There were these heaps of bandages
piled up all over the floor.

36:17.440 --> 36:21.440
Almost done.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.240
There.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.480
I want you to keep it
immobile for at least a week.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.680
When can I go back to work?

36:30.680 --> 36:31.320
We'll see.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.720
We'll see.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.720
Helen, for once,
give yourself some time.

36:49.280 --> 36:53.280
The colour's excellent.
So is the size and symmetry.

36:53.320 --> 36:57.320
There's a little bruising but...

36:57.680 --> 37:00.160
I want to see it.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.200
Alone.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.440
Alone.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.800
I'll be back in a few minutes to
put on a new dressing.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.800
Thanks, Bobby.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
HE CLEARS THROAT

37:36.720 --> 37:38.240
KNOCK ON DOOR

37:38.240 --> 37:42.240
It's open.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.880
Something you want?

37:49.880 --> 37:51.320
Something you want?

37:51.320 --> 37:54.000
I know what you're going to say
but you don't have to worry.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.320
I promise, no more Mr Entertainment.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.320
I'm going to go back
and be my old self, Lyle Brubaker.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.560
You told me that before.

38:04.560 --> 38:08.080
I know but this time it's different.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.120
It's different.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.800
I swear on the grave
of Billie Holiday.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.920
I don't know.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.440
I don't know.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.800
I'll concentrate,
I'll do what I'm told.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.600
Please.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.600
Please.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.640
You are a good worker
when you concentrate.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.000
OK.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.280
Thanks, Mr Morgan, thank you.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.360
But...no singing!

38:36.360 --> 38:38.080
Under any circumstances.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.960
Not a note, not a rest, not a G-clef.

38:41.960 --> 38:44.480
Tomorrow morning, first thing, up to
the solarium,

38:44.480 --> 38:45.960
you wash all the windows.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.000
Welcome back, Len.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Solarium, first thing, right?

38:57.600 --> 39:00.080
Ellen. &gt;

39:00.080 --> 39:02.240
Ellen? &gt;

39:02.240 --> 39:03.280
Mark?

39:03.280 --> 39:06.880
Mark?

39:06.880 --> 39:07.920
Yes.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.920
Yes.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.400
Oh.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.040
Oh, Mark, where have you been?
It's almost 1.00.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.560
I told you,
I was going for a ride. &gt;

39:20.560 --> 39:23.880
When I hit New Hampshire,
I figured I should turn around. &gt;

39:23.880 --> 39:25.200
Any phone calls? &gt;

39:25.200 --> 39:26.840
Any phone calls? &gt;

39:26.840 --> 39:28.280
No calls? &gt;

39:28.280 --> 39:31.640
Well, my mother called.
She loved the show. So did I.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.080
Please, I don't need a lot of hollow
sentiments right now. &gt;

39:35.080 --> 39:39.080
Oh, honey,
despite what you may think,

39:39.360 --> 39:42.440
it was actually quite positive.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.560
I looked like a moron. &gt;

39:44.560 --> 39:46.280
You're too hyper-critical.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.680
Oh, really? &gt;

39:47.680 --> 39:51.440
Quote, Martinet, "primadonna."

39:51.440 --> 39:54.560
Quote, Martinet, "primadonna."

39:54.560 --> 39:57.120
Don't cloud the issue.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.280
&lt; You're too demanding, Mark.
Mostly of yourself.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.760
You were that way back at Penn too.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.520
WATER RUNNING

40:05.520 --> 40:09.520
Maybe that's why you're
so good at what you do.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.280
All I know for sure is

40:12.280 --> 40:15.520
that I fell in love with the biggest
hard-ass on campus.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.440
It's going to take a whole lot more
than a silly TV show

40:18.440 --> 40:22.120
to make me feel otherwise.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.840
Mark?

40:25.840 --> 40:28.920
Did you say something, honey?

40:28.920 --> 40:31.480
For crying out loud!

40:31.480 --> 40:33.400
Goodnight.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.840
Goodnight.

40:35.840 --> 40:38.120
Ellen.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.120
What?

40:40.120 --> 40:41.760
I love you too.

40:41.760 --> 40:45.760
(LAUGHING)

40:48.560 --> 40:52.560
CRASHING

40:52.640 --> 40:54.480
Excuse me.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.760
It's time for me
to wash the windows in here.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.240
Go ahead.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.040
Mr Entertainment.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.160
No, no.
I'm not Mr Entertainment any more.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.600
My name is Lyle Brubaker.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.600
I won't sing and I won't dance,
don't ask me.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.720
No, no, no, no.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.840
I gotta stop doing that
because I gotta do a good job

41:13.840 --> 41:17.840
and the only way to do a good job
is to concentrate on it.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.480
Frank and Sammy and Deano would
have done the same thing.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.400
You seem like a smart lady.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.960
If you'd had second billing to
a dancing donkey,

41:32.960 --> 41:34.800
could you have performed?

41:34.800 --> 41:36.760
What are you talking about?

41:36.760 --> 41:40.240
(CLEARING THROAT)

41:40.240 --> 41:42.080
Not being good enough.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.720
Why?

41:43.720 --> 41:46.920
(STARTS TO SING)
Because seasons change and so do I.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.400
You need not wonder why.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.680
No.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.920
(GROANING)

41:51.920 --> 41:55.200
I got to concentrate.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.320
I tried it and I failed.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.920
There, I said it.
Hate me if you want to.

41:59.920 --> 42:03.920
I don't hate you.
I barely know you.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.320
Well, back to washing windows
and sweeping floors.

42:11.400 --> 42:15.400
You know what it's like to
have no options?

42:15.400 --> 42:18.440
Yes, I do.
You'll get used to it.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.680
I don't like it.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.560
I don't like thinking
I'll always be an amateur.

42:23.560 --> 42:27.440
There's no higher goal to attain
than to make people happy.

42:27.440 --> 42:31.320
Your singing makes people happy.

42:31.320 --> 42:35.320
And you're still Mr Entertainment.

42:36.120 --> 42:39.240
I am?

42:39.240 --> 42:42.120
You still have your identity.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.840
You should be glad you have one.

42:44.840 --> 42:48.520
Mine was stolen.

42:48.520 --> 42:52.520
There is nothing safe in this
hospital!

42:52.880 --> 42:55.720
There was another woman on floor west
who had her purse taken.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.320
She was real upset about it

42:57.320 --> 43:00.800
and I told her the same thing I'm
going to tell you. Carry a wallet.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.240
What?

43:03.240 --> 43:04.560
It wasn't your fault.

43:04.560 --> 43:08.320
It was my fault. I...

43:08.320 --> 43:12.040
..tried to help him.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.040
How could he have done that to me?

43:16.320 --> 43:19.400
(SOBBING)

43:19.400 --> 43:22.440
Well, don't worry.

43:22.440 --> 43:26.440
Look, you can go to the DMV and get
a new license and don't forget...

43:27.120 --> 43:30.040
to cancel your credit cards.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.040
And don't follow leaders,
watch your parking meters.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.480
No.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.480
(SOBBING)

43:38.560 --> 43:40.560
And don't be sad.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.560
God, I wish it was that easy!

43:43.560 --> 43:44.640
I understand.

43:44.640 --> 43:45.680
I understand.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.720
I understand.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.720
Don't...be sad.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.440
You want to borrow some money?

43:54.440 --> 43:57.200
You can pay it back
whenever you want.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.960
No, thank you.

43:58.960 --> 44:02.960
That's what friends are for.

44:06.120 --> 44:10.120
Well, can I do something for you?

44:12.080 --> 44:15.440
Sing me a song.

44:15.440 --> 44:19.440
Please.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.880
(CLEARS THROAT)

44:52.360 --> 44:56.360
# Walked with no-one
and talked with no-one

44:56.400 --> 44:58.960
# And I had nothing but shadows

44:58.960 --> 45:01.720
# Then one morning you passed

45:01.720 --> 45:04.680
# And I brightened at last

45:04.680 --> 45:07.840
# Now I greet the day
and complete the day

45:07.840 --> 45:11.000
# With the sun in my heart

45:11.000 --> 45:14.360
# All my worries blew away

45:14.360 --> 45:18.360
# When you taught me how to say

45:19.240 --> 45:23.240
# Grab your coat and get your hat

45:23.440 --> 45:26.440
# Leave your worries on the doorstep

45:26.440 --> 45:28.840
# Just direct your feet

45:28.840 --> 45:32.080
# To the sunny side of the street

45:32.080 --> 45:36.080
# Can't you hear a pitter pat

45:36.160 --> 45:39.680
# And that happy tune is your step

45:39.680 --> 45:41.600
# Life can be so sweet

45:41.600 --> 45:44.920
# On the sunny side of the street

45:44.920 --> 45:48.920
# Oh, I used to walk in the shade

45:48.960 --> 45:52.240
# With those blues on parade

45:52.240 --> 45:55.200
# But I'm not afraid

45:55.200 --> 45:58.200
# This rover's crossed over

45:58.200 --> 46:02.200
# Oh, if I never had a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller

46:04.440 --> 46:08.040
# Gold dust at my feet

46:08.040 --> 46:12.040
# On the sunny side

46:12.520 --> 46:16.520
# Of the street... #

46:30.280 --> 46:49.000
