00:09.761 --> 00:12.722
<i>NARRATOR".
Another dazzling day in Gotham City...</i>

00:12.931 --> 00:18.311
<i>...a metropolis which prides itself
on family fidelity, paternal devotion...</i>

00:18.895 --> 00:23.691
<i>...and most particularly,
its annual Mother of the Year presentation.</i>

00:23.900 --> 00:27.195
And so it gives me a great deal of pleasure...

00:27.403 --> 00:30.740
...to present the winner
of this year's Mother of the Year Award.

00:30.949 --> 00:32.951
Such a dear little lady.

00:35.286 --> 00:38.331
Won't you say a few words,
Mother of the Year?

00:38.540 --> 00:42.085
Why, Mrs. Chairlady,
I'd be happy to say a few words.

00:42.293 --> 00:43.711
Stick them up!

00:45.547 --> 00:48.550
Now, calm down. Calm down, ladies.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.302
I wanna introduce my boys.

00:51.511 --> 00:53.096
Pretty Boy.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.516
Machine Gun.

00:57.559 --> 01:00.228
And Mad Dog.

01:00.979 --> 01:03.022
- And now, ladies--
-Ma.

01:03.231 --> 01:07.068
Oh, yeah, my fourth child, a girl, Legs.

01:07.569 --> 01:12.073
All right, boys, let's relieve these ladies
of a few extra pounds.

01:15.952 --> 01:18.204
- Ha-ha-ha.
-Thanks for letting me come along, Ma.

01:18.413 --> 01:19.956
I don't know whether I should've.

01:20.164 --> 01:21.749
Girls just don't belong in crime.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.335
Ma, I'll prove myself.

01:24.544 --> 01:26.296
Hand it over, fat lady.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.298
<i>I'm not fiat. I'm not, I'm not.</i>

01:30.675 --> 01:31.759
The earrings.

01:31.968 --> 01:35.263
Get the ring. The money,
the money in the purse. Go on, boys.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.894
This is bad news, Chief O'Hara.

01:42.103 --> 01:45.773
Ma Parker and her boys in Gotham City.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.567
Bad news, commissioner?

01:47.775 --> 01:48.818
It's disaster.

01:49.027 --> 01:51.696
They've terrorized almost every other city
in the country.

01:51.904 --> 01:54.532
But they've never operated
in our fair metropolis before.

01:54.741 --> 01:57.452
Now, there's been a special reason
for that, chief?

01:57.660 --> 02:02.415
Yes, sir. We've got the finest law enforcement
organization there is.

02:03.333 --> 02:06.085
Chief O'Hara, let's give credit
where credit is due, shall we?

02:06.294 --> 02:07.337
<i>L</i> just did.

02:07.545 --> 02:10.381
I mean Batman and Robin,
they're the ones she's always feared.

02:10.590 --> 02:14.427
And you don't think
she's frightened of them anymore?

02:14.636 --> 02:16.512
I wouldn't venture to guess...

02:16.721 --> 02:20.683
...but I do know it will take the Dynamic Duo
to end her career...

02:20.892 --> 02:23.645
...once and for all.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

02:36.074 --> 02:38.117
I'll call him, sir.

02:41.788 --> 02:44.499
Gosh, Bruce, Greek is still Greek to me.

02:44.707 --> 02:48.628
It's Greek to a lot of Greeks too. Heh.

02:48.836 --> 02:53.132
It's one of the world's oldest, most important,
most beautiful languages.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.550
It may be, Aunt Harriet...

02:54.759 --> 02:57.470
...but can't we take a breather
and work out in the gym for a while?

02:57.679 --> 03:00.223
But the mind needs exercise too, Dick.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.725
Well, my mind is getting muscle-bound.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.977
There's an old saying, Dick.

03:05.186 --> 03:10.358
A sound mind and a sound body.
A worthy goal.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.068
Now, what do you wanna do first?

03:12.276 --> 03:15.697
- Parse, conjugate, or decline?
-Decline.

03:15.905 --> 03:19.200
-It's the Batphone, sir.
-Hm? Yes.

03:19.409 --> 03:20.993
It just occurred to me, Dick.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.871
Commissioner Gordon
is a Greek scholar of note.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.417
He may be able to tell us
more than books and blackboards.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.751
I'd like to talk to him.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.087
Excuse us, Aunt Harriet.

03:31.713 --> 03:36.217
You know, Bruce comes up
with such bright ideas.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.010
Indeed, madam, yes.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.348
Yes, commissioner?

03:42.557 --> 03:44.809
Batman, a crisis.

03:45.017 --> 03:48.312
The infamous Ma Parker
has invaded our fair city.

03:48.521 --> 03:50.106
We're on our way.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.817
To the Batpoles.

05:31.666 --> 05:33.209
Why?

05:33.751 --> 05:36.629
This criminal record is incredible.

05:36.838 --> 05:41.092
How, gentlemen?
How has this Ma Parker remained at large?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.386
She's crafty, Batman. She's clever.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.973
But most of all, she's motherly.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.726
You mean toward her four sons?

05:50.935 --> 05:52.603
Three sons and a daughter, Batman.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.940
The girl, if anything,
is even more dangerous than the boys.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.401
Although Ma Parker only likes boys.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.571
In fact, she calls every hoodlum her boy.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.240
She's the greatest mother of them all.

06:04.907 --> 06:10.413
Surely, a woman with her maternal instinct
can't be all bad.

06:10.955 --> 06:13.416
Don't let false sentiment trap you, Batman.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.669
Ma Parker may also be the greatest menace
of your career.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.754
Holy rocking chair.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.883
Gordon speaking.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.217
What?

06:23.426 --> 06:25.386
Yes. Fine.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.515
The Gotham police have surrounded
their hideout on Cherry Blossom Road.

06:29.724 --> 06:33.227
Ma Parker and her family are inside.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.478
Come on, Robin.

06:34.687 --> 06:37.648
Let's help a little old lady across the street...

06:37.857 --> 06:39.525
...and in to the penitentiary.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.075
All right, Ma Parker, we know you're in there.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.453
We've got the house surrounded.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.622
Hey, Ma, did you hear that?

06:52.830 --> 06:55.833
You eat your vegetables, Machine Gun,
or you ain't gonna get no dessert.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.168
Oh, Ma, I hate carrots.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.838
They're good for your eyes, son,
you eat them, help you shoot straight.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.633
Hey, Mad Dog, that's my grapefruit.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.260
You want it? Take it.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.931
Stop the horseplay, you two.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.144
Ma Parker, you haven't got a chance.

07:15.353 --> 07:17.271
Surrender or we're coming after you.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.856
Ma, do you think they mean it?

07:19.065 --> 07:22.735
You just eat your supper, boys.
I'll take care of them.

07:40.878 --> 07:44.340
- We haven't got a chance.
-We have if we stand in the direct line of fire.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.926
Ma Parker and her boys
are known as the worst shots.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.511
Yeah, maybe.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.389
Here come the Cape Crusaders.

07:56.519 --> 08:01.023
Well, well, guess who's paying us
a social call, Batman and Robin.

08:01.232 --> 08:03.442
Just like I hoped.

08:04.485 --> 08:08.489
Nincompoops, how many times I have
to tell you, Batman and Robin can't hurt us.

08:08.698 --> 08:10.032
They can only help us.

08:10.783 --> 08:12.034
Oh, gee, that's right.

08:12.243 --> 08:13.285
I almost forgot.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.537
Good old Ma.

08:14.745 --> 08:18.165
You mean good old Dynamic Duo?

08:20.042 --> 08:21.502
It's no use, Batman.

08:21.711 --> 08:25.339
Ma Parker has an arsenal in there.
It would take an army to get her out.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.383
Holy gunpowder, Batman. What can we do?

08:27.591 --> 08:30.803
Remember, Robin,
they say an army travels on its stomach.

08:31.012 --> 08:33.931
- I get it, Batman. We crawl on the roof.
-Precisely, Robin.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.393
This time, it won't be necessary
to use Batropes.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.106
What's happening, Ma'?

08:42.940 --> 08:46.652
Batman and Robin are climbing up
the side of the house.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.822
Where are they now, Ma?

08:52.742 --> 08:54.994
Oh, they're crawling along the drain pipe.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.496
Boy, that was some meal, Ma.

08:59.874 --> 09:01.667
Oh, they've reached the window.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.169
Hey, Ma, what's for dessert?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.713
Apple pie.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.677
Oh, they're coming through it.

09:11.886 --> 09:13.262
They sure are.

09:15.931 --> 09:19.727
- Batman, look out for Ma Parker.
-This Batmagnet should do the trick.

09:23.064 --> 09:25.149
Legs, clear the table. Go get him, boys.

09:38.704 --> 09:39.830
My babies.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.940
My boys, my poor boys.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.400
What have you done to them, Batman?

10:08.609 --> 10:11.112
Sorry, Ma Parker, violence begets violence.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.324
Oh, Pretty Boy, you're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.827
It's only ketchup. A bottle fell on him.

10:18.035 --> 10:21.539
Oh, Batman, please,
please don't hurt my boys.

10:21.747 --> 10:24.083
The law will see to their punishment, not I.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.378
But, Batman, I'm only a poor mother
all alone...

10:27.586 --> 10:31.006
...trying to raise my little brood
the best I know how.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.009
I didn't mean any harm.

10:34.218 --> 10:37.888
I'm sure the law
will deal with you mercifully, Ma.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.890
Oh, thank you, Batman.

10:40.099 --> 10:43.602
I always knew that you had a heart.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.735
Look, Batman and Robin have captured her.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.737
Ohh.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.073
Oh, don't shoot, officers.

10:56.282 --> 10:58.701
Don't shoot this old gray head.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.703
Why, she looks like my own mother.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.580
I never meant to harm anybody.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.792
I'm just a poor mother trying to get along.

11:07.001 --> 11:10.004
Take that, you sentimental fools.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.423
Holy hairdo.
She's got a smoke bomb.

11:18.179 --> 11:20.973
Come on, children, come on.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.935
Batman, they're getting away.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.146
Not if I can help it.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.027
One down, four to go, Robin.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.112
There they go.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.283
- Let's go after them, Batman.
-it's no use.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.911
We couldn't even find the Batmobile
in this smoke.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.704
At least we got one of their gang.

11:43.913 --> 11:47.166
We would've had them all if I hadn't let
my emotions lead me astray.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.500
Mark my word.

11:48.709 --> 11:53.631
I won't rest until Ma Parker and her brood
are in Gotham State Penitentiary.

11:53.839 --> 11:57.676
Neither will Ma, Batman. Ha-ha-ha!

12:06.310 --> 12:09.605
I just programmed the crime computer, Robin.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.733
It contains the information
about Ma Parker and her activities.

12:12.942 --> 12:14.276
Holy forecast, Batman.

12:14.485 --> 12:19.657
- Can it really tell us where she'll strike next?
-Criminals invariably follow a pattern, Robin.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.243
Remember Archer and the way he worked.

12:22.451 --> 12:25.871
I've designed this computer
to trace that pattern electronically.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.831
You think of everything.

12:28.874 --> 12:32.795
When fighting crime, even the
most minute detail must not be ignored.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.257
Ah. There's the answer.

12:40.844 --> 12:46.016
The crime computer points out that Ma Parker's
been robbing wealthy society gatherings.

12:46.225 --> 12:49.061
The box office at the horse show.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.772
The Flower Guild Tea Dance.

12:51.981 --> 12:54.942
A wedding reception
at the Gotham Plaza Hotel.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.194
That may be interesting and very valuable...

12:57.403 --> 12:59.863
...but how can we tell
where she's gonna strike next?

13:00.072 --> 13:04.827
In my everyday role as Bruce Wayne,
I receive many invitations, Robin.

13:05.035 --> 13:10.791
Today's social calendar includes the
monthly meeting of the Gotham Breakfast Club.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.585
But that's a little early even for Ma Parker.

13:14.128 --> 13:17.089
There's the mayor's luncheon
for that visiting prince.

13:17.298 --> 13:18.882
But that's too heavily guarded.

13:19.091 --> 13:24.763
And there's a special society gathering,
a benefit at the Bijou Theater this afternoon.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.433
It's been well publicized.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.686
Now, that event may attract a wealthier crowd.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.355
Bingo. Maybe we better catch that matinee.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.606
Yes, Robin.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.108
We're off to the movies.

13:49.955 --> 13:51.957
Good work, boys.
That was a four-star performance.

13:53.334 --> 13:54.585
Look, Ma.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.005
Let's get out of here.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.595
Sonny, would you give a poor old lady
a lift.

14:04.803 --> 14:05.846
Beat it, Granny.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.932
Why, is that any way for you
to talk to your elders?

14:09.141 --> 14:10.351
Sorry, ma'am.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.857
I've got a slight headache.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.151
So now, I wanna pick up a pill.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.611
Get in the back, kids.

14:30.371 --> 14:34.333
- Okay, Caped Crusader, you got me.
-All right, let's see what's in that case.

14:35.751 --> 14:39.421
- A violin.
-Yeah, Ma wants me to take lessons.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.966
You'll have plenty of time to practice
in the penitentiary.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.555
Everything is going great, Ma.
Just like you planned.

14:50.099 --> 14:53.143
I told you to wear a sweater
in the air-conditioned theater, Mad Dog.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.646
- Now you'll catch a cold.
-I'm okay, Ma.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.690
That reminds me, I've gotta send Pretty Boy's
long underwear.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.984
And some of my special nutty cookies, huh?

15:01.193 --> 15:03.278
I hear the food's good in the pen, Ma.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.739
Well, we're soon gonna find out, huh?

15:13.664 --> 15:16.166
We've scoured the city, Batman,
no sign of that truck.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.377
There's one more place we might try, Robin.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.631
Remember what Ma Parker said
before she got away about a slight headache?

15:22.840 --> 15:27.136
- You think she went to a drugstore?
-Perhaps, but not for a headache tablet.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.765
May I suggest you lock your car, sir.

15:31.974 --> 15:36.103
Your local police are asking all Gotham City-ites
to cooperate in their current campaign.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.148
You might place this sticker on your bumper.

15:49.158 --> 15:50.534
All right, folks, come on.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.245
Just keep filling up the jar,
it's for a worthy cause.

15:53.454 --> 15:55.289
Come on, come on.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.874
This is disgraceful.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.667
Why should I give you my money?

15:58.876 --> 16:01.128
Because we give you trading stamps, dearie.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.172
Come on, hand it over.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.466
Looks like almost three grand, Ma.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.552
Well, well, you're good for something
even if you are a girl.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.889
Aren't you glad Ma made you study
arithmetic?

16:12.097 --> 16:15.017
I always say there's no substitute
for a good education.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.810
Speaking of arithmetic, Ma, look.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.395
One and one makes two.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.448
Her aim is not too good
if the target is moving.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.283
Let's keep it moving.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.118
Look out, Batman.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.249
Holy greeting cards. He's out cold.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.214
You saved us, Batman.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.882
Yes, but where is Ma Parker?

16:47.090 --> 16:50.260
She got away while you were catching that one.
Thank you, Batman.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.429
Thank you, Robin.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.101
At least we're taking her boys out of action.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.979
Yes, but remember
what Commissioner Gordon said.

17:01.188 --> 17:05.692
Ma Parker's girl is more dangerous
than her three boys.

17:06.193 --> 17:09.530
Her legs sort of reminded me of Catwoman's.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.117
You're growing up, Robin.

17:14.409 --> 17:19.998
Remember, in crime-fighting,
always keep your sights raised.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.919
I don't like admitting this, Robin.

17:24.127 --> 17:28.840
But even the crime computer
can't tell us where Ma Parker's hideout is.

17:29.049 --> 17:33.178
In this mechanized age, it's a wonder that more
machines don't get just as tired as people.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.264
I mean, they have a goof or two coming.

17:35.472 --> 17:40.477
She has to be someplace,
and someplace in Gotham City...

17:40.686 --> 17:44.398
...where she can more or less melt
into the background.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.983
Holy camouflage!

17:46.191 --> 17:47.234
Exactly!

17:47.442 --> 17:49.611
Now, where would an old lady go?

17:49.820 --> 17:53.907
These days, just about anywhere.
Look at Aunt Harriet, the way she gets around.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.784
But Ma Parker's different.

17:55.993 --> 18:01.915
I suspect she'd be, at this point,
making a conventional and an orthodox move.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.544
An old people's home
is conventional and orthodox.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.171
But it's only for old people.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.091
You're not only growing up, Robin.

18:11.300 --> 18:16.972
But you've just proved that the human brain
is the best thinking machine ever devised.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.975
Gosh, maybe those Greek lessons
are helping after all.

18:20.183 --> 18:24.313
And what could be more orthodox
than the Gotham City Old Folks Home...

18:24.521 --> 18:27.399
...on the outskirts of the city?

18:28.066 --> 18:30.485
I know it's a needle in a haystack.

18:30.694 --> 18:32.029
It's a leap in the dark.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.574
- Well, we leaped before, Batman.
-Let's go.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.834
Here's a picture of Ma Parker.
Have you seen her?

18:46.043 --> 18:48.378
Why, she looks just like Mrs. Smith.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.713
Then we found her.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.257
But it couldn't be.
Mrs. Smith's an invalid.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.636
- I'm sure she's not the one you want.
-Would you point her out?

18:56.386 --> 19:01.058
Why, yes. She should be coming down
the corridor right now.

19:03.644 --> 19:06.104
It sure is nice and quiet, here.
Isn't it, Ma?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.398
So relaxed and pretty.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.027
I don't think it's so relaxed and pretty.
Look.

19:12.694 --> 19:16.406
- Look.
-it's Batman and Robin. I surrender.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.075
Not yet. What a nincompoop.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.744
- I knew I should never trust a girl.
-But, Ma--

19:20.952 --> 19:23.538
How many times I have to tell you,
we can't make it look too easy.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.381
Holy Wernher von Braun!
Look at that wheelchair go!

19:32.589 --> 19:34.549
How is she gonna get through the wall?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.220
She didn't.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.978
All right, all right. Batman, I give up.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.148
I knew it was a mistake
ever to come to Gotham City.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.609
You're old enough to know
that crime doesn't pay.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.820
Oh, you're a very bright boy, sonny.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.030
And also a very good boy.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.158
You sure all this running around
is good for you?

20:00.367 --> 20:04.371
And you think you get plenty of rest
and nourishment, huh?

20:04.579 --> 20:06.748
Let's go, Ma Parker.

20:12.963 --> 20:17.509
I can't help thinking that something's wrong.

20:21.138 --> 20:25.058
<i>NARRATOR".
Sometime later at Gotham State Penitentiary...</i>

20:25.267 --> 20:26.852
Congratulations, Batman and Robin.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.646
Once again,
you put vicious criminals where they belong.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.275
The real work is only beginning, commissioner.
The work of rehabilitation.

20:33.483 --> 20:37.028
-Isn't that right, Warden Crichton?
-I'm glad you see it that way, Batman.

20:37.946 --> 20:41.199
You see, Ma Parker, boys, you too, miss.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.162
Our job at Gotham State Penitentiary
isn't to punish you.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.622
It's to help you become useful citizens again.

20:47.831 --> 20:51.001
To make you understand
that crime really doesn't pay.

20:51.168 --> 20:52.461
Oh.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.505
Not in Gotham City anyway.
Thanks to the Dynamic Duo.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.800
Why, half this prison is filled
with crooks they've caught.

20:59.009 --> 21:04.014
That's right. The most notorious,
the most clever criminals are right here.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.807
But even if they were to escape...

21:06.016 --> 21:08.852
...we know that Batman and Robin
would bring them right back.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.564
- We'd better be going, warden.
- Well, thank you again, Batman, Robin.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.650
You've made me proud of my profession.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.444
Warden.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.951
All right, guards, take them to their cells.

21:27.412 --> 21:31.708
Didn't you hear me? I said, take Ma Parker
and her children back to the cell block.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.003
What's the matter with you?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.340
What's going on around here?

21:38.548 --> 21:40.842
I'll tell you
what's going on around here, warden.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.596
We're taking over your prison. Ha-ha-ha!

21:45.430 --> 21:46.473
What?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.642
I've been planning this for months.

21:48.850 --> 21:52.687
One by one, I've been substituting
members of my gang for your guards.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.857
And now, the prison belongs to us.
Ha, ha.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.443
Why, this is incredible.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.779
I don't believe you.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.824
Guards, help. Guards.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.785
It's no use, warden.
Ha, ha.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.623
Ahh. So you wanted Batman and Robin
to capture you?

22:11.832 --> 22:13.166
Sure thing.

22:13.375 --> 22:17.921
Why, warden, we're gonna use
Gotham State Pen for our own purposes.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.466
You said you got some of the smartest crooks
in the country right here.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.511
And now, we got you here too.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.847
You can't prevail.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.391
Not with Batman and Robin around.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.812
What are you planning?

22:34.312 --> 22:36.773
Why, warden, it's already planned.

22:36.982 --> 22:41.319
One of your trustees is taking care
of Batman right now.

22:57.794 --> 23:01.631
Ha, ha. I was just looking
at your great Batmobile engine, Batman.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.091
It does the job.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.595
Warden says his car won't do
more than 70 on the road.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.264
I bet you could do a hundred.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.409
That's right, warden.

23:29.618 --> 23:33.163
When the speedometer hits 60,
the Batmobile blows up.
