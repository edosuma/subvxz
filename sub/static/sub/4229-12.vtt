Please...Help me.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.808
Please...Help me.
Come on.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.242
Hang on.

01:27.851 --> 01:30.286
Oh, my God.

01:33.757 --> 01:35.925
Oh, my God.

01:39.731 --> 01:41.971
Help me! Dingaan! Dingaan!
There's something in the pond!

01:41.995 --> 01:43.099
Help!

01:43.101 --> 01:46.068
Denny! Denny?!
Dingaan! Help me!

01:46.070 --> 01:47.336
Don't leave us!

01:47.338 --> 01:48.771
Get it off me!

01:48.773 --> 01:52.341
Get it off me!
God! God!

01:54.244 --> 01:57.279
There it is again.
Used to be every 60 seconds.

01:57.281 --> 01:59.415
Now it's every 10.

01:59.417 --> 02:02.118
There you go.
Help yourself.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.487
You're getting pretty good
at that.

02:04.489 --> 02:08.491
It's been 24 hours. Dad and Lexi
should be there by now.

02:08.493 --> 02:11.026
Let's stay focused
on our job.

02:11.027 --> 02:12.194
If there's
gonna be an attack,

02:12.196 --> 02:13.496
it's bound
to happen pretty soon.

02:13.498 --> 02:16.198
Keep your dukes up.

02:33.016 --> 02:36.285
You're pushing.
Don't force it.

02:37.421 --> 02:39.388
Aim for the heart.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.391
Now, remember,
when you're in a situation

02:42.393 --> 02:45.561
where you don't have a gun,
you only get one chance.

02:45.563 --> 02:49.064
Try again.

02:52.035 --> 02:53.402
Bull's-eye!

02:56.941 --> 02:58.941
Do you think...

02:58.943 --> 03:03.112
that's why Hal gave dad
the syringe...with the poison?

03:03.114 --> 03:04.480
What syringe?

03:04.482 --> 03:07.016
You know, before he got
on the ship with Lexi, he --

03:08.084 --> 03:09.552
just in case.

03:09.554 --> 03:11.921
I thought you knew.

03:11.923 --> 03:13.355
And your dad agreed
to take it?

03:13.357 --> 03:15.057
Yeah.

03:17.461 --> 03:19.428
Huh.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.131
Good work, Matt.

03:22.133 --> 03:25.100
That was unbelievable -- bull's-eye.
Thanks.

03:25.102 --> 03:28.537
Let's check
the perimeter.

03:34.411 --> 03:38.180
Hey, be careful
on your watch out there.

03:40.984 --> 03:43.319
Dingaan's recon team

03:43.321 --> 03:45.321
was only supposed to scout
a two-mile radius.

03:45.323 --> 03:46.856
He should be back by now.

03:46.858 --> 03:48.457
And they're not
the only squad overdue.

03:48.459 --> 03:49.959
Anthony's team was supposed
to be back over an hour ago.

03:49.961 --> 03:51.561
Well, let's just hope
they didn't meet up

03:51.562 --> 03:55.064
with that scorched Overlord
with the burn-torture fetish.

03:55.066 --> 03:58.067
Dingaan should have taken
more people. Idiot.

04:00.071 --> 04:02.938
Whoa, whoa, Dingaan!

04:02.940 --> 04:04.440
Hey, you okay?

04:04.442 --> 04:07.643
Where's the -- where's
the rest of your patrol?

04:07.645 --> 04:09.144
They're gone.

04:11.015 --> 04:12.674
They're all gone.

04:26.162 --> 04:29.198
"It's not
what happens to you

04:29.200 --> 04:32.535
but how you choose to react
that matters."

04:44.549 --> 04:47.049
Autopilot's latched
onto the homing beacon.

04:47.051 --> 04:49.218
Wherever the Espheni's
power core is on the Moon,

04:49.220 --> 04:51.387
we're heading
straight for it.

04:51.389 --> 04:55.157
All right.
I'm gonna check the bombs.

04:59.529 --> 05:00.663
Oh, no.

05:00.665 --> 05:03.666
The breach in the hull.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.001
The temperature must have caused
the bomb casings to crack

05:06.003 --> 05:06.904
while we were in stasis.

05:06.928 --> 05:08.945
I had to turn off life support
to preserve power.

05:09.473 --> 05:12.041
I didn't know that --
What? That it would destroy the bomb?

05:12.043 --> 05:13.976
Oh, I'm sure
there's another explanation.

05:13.978 --> 05:17.646
You don't think
I sabotaged it.

05:17.648 --> 05:19.315
You still
don't trust me?

05:19.317 --> 05:22.151
No, I trust you, Lexi.
That's my choice.

05:22.153 --> 05:24.019
But trust isn't really the issue
right now.

05:24.021 --> 05:27.022
We have to blow up
the power core...

05:27.024 --> 05:29.224
And we don't have a bomb.

05:32.262 --> 05:34.930
Well, no, no, no. Hold on.
I-it doesn't work that way.

05:34.932 --> 05:36.332
I'm not a doomsday device.
Come on, Lexi.

05:36.334 --> 05:37.774
I saw you wipe Beamers
out of the sky

05:37.798 --> 05:39.101
without even
lifting a finger.

05:39.103 --> 05:41.270
What I do relies
on concentration,

05:41.272 --> 05:43.639
directing the natural forces
around me like gravity,

05:43.641 --> 05:45.341
which doesn't work
in this vacuum.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.383
Okay, well, when we get closer
to the lunar surface,

05:47.407 --> 05:49.111
you can't use
the Moon's gravity?

05:49.113 --> 05:52.047
I mean, I might get
a little bit stronger, but --

05:52.049 --> 05:53.716
Wouldn't be the same?
No.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.621
Is that our target?

05:58.623 --> 06:00.255
Yes.

06:00.257 --> 06:02.591
It's a mining platform,
refinery, and energy plant

06:02.593 --> 06:04.126
all in one.

06:04.128 --> 06:06.495
To deploy helium-3.
Son of a bitch.

06:06.497 --> 06:07.997
So that's it, huh?

06:17.641 --> 06:20.009
So they extract the helium-3
from the lunar rock

06:20.011 --> 06:21.492
and then use the ore
as a fuel source.

06:21.513 --> 06:22.545
Exactly.

06:22.546 --> 06:24.546
They refine the ore
into energy

06:24.548 --> 06:26.248
and deliver it
to the power core,

06:26.250 --> 06:28.250
which converts it
into wireless electricity

06:28.252 --> 06:30.119
and beams it
to the Earth.

06:33.023 --> 06:35.257
Wireless electricity.

06:36.126 --> 06:38.661
Tesla said
it was possible.

06:38.663 --> 06:40.295
So that's how they do it.

06:40.297 --> 06:42.498
That's how
they power everything --

06:42.500 --> 06:45.601
all the ghetto walls
and the Mechs and the Beamers.

06:45.603 --> 06:47.636
That's how they're turning
humans into skitters.

06:47.638 --> 06:50.606
Yes. Everything they need
to fuel their war machine.

06:50.608 --> 06:53.308
I mean, it's no accident
that the Espheni chose earth.

06:53.310 --> 06:55.177
They need
a life-sustaining planet

06:55.179 --> 06:56.612
close to
a helium-rich Moon.

06:56.614 --> 06:58.647
That Overlord
that I burned,

06:58.649 --> 07:00.449
he said that
there was a danger coming,

07:00.451 --> 07:01.851
a force that
we couldn't comprehend.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.253
What the hell?

07:04.255 --> 07:05.855
Something's overriding
our homing beacon,

07:05.879 --> 07:07.656
pulling us off course.

07:12.729 --> 07:14.630
They're onto us.

07:28.435 --> 07:30.970
It's pulling us in
to dock.

07:31.341 --> 07:32.774
I'm not gonna stand here
and wait.

07:33.176 --> 07:35.176
Get behind me.

07:52.761 --> 07:55.096
Blow something up,
would you, please?

07:55.098 --> 07:56.864
And hurry back home.

07:59.334 --> 08:02.837
We came upon a militia camp
deep in the woods.

08:02.839 --> 08:06.841
Seemed abandoned, so I sent
Dick and Denny to fan out,

08:06.843 --> 08:08.342
check around.

08:08.344 --> 08:10.077
I-it was hard to see.

08:10.079 --> 08:13.781
There was a thick layer of fog
everywhere.

08:13.783 --> 08:16.284
But then I realized
why it was so quiet.

08:16.286 --> 08:18.352
Soldiers
were all on the ground.

08:18.354 --> 08:23.157
They had these things pulsating
on their chests.

08:23.159 --> 08:26.827
S-s-some of the people
were convulsing,

08:26.829 --> 08:29.897
tra-- transforming
into something else.

08:29.899 --> 08:33.134
After a while,
they weren't even screaming.

08:33.135 --> 08:38.105
I-I-I tried to help,
but they were stuck somehow,

08:38.107 --> 08:42.342
trapped in some kind of tar
on the ground.

08:42.345 --> 08:47.381
One of them looked at me,
right into my eyes.

08:47.383 --> 08:51.218
It was like how a hungry animal
looks at its prey.

08:52.721 --> 08:55.656
That's when I started to run.

08:55.658 --> 08:58.225
I couldn't save them.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.827
You'd be dead, too,
if you didn't run.

08:59.829 --> 09:02.229
Human skitters.
There's no question.

09:02.231 --> 09:04.965
Saw them working on this
when I was with Lexi that,

09:04.967 --> 09:07.935
I guess,
they don't have to drag us off

09:07.937 --> 09:10.037
to some factory
to mutate us anymore.

09:10.039 --> 09:12.173
They can just drop it
right in our laps.

09:12.175 --> 09:14.308
They're turning us into
skitters on our own turf.

09:14.310 --> 09:16.310
You see anyone else there?

09:16.312 --> 09:18.112
You mean Sara?

09:18.114 --> 09:19.413
That's not
what I asked.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.415
Nothing headed
in this direction.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.719
- Yeah, for now.
- All right, ladies.

09:24.721 --> 09:27.088
Let's wrap up
the bedtime story.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.990
All right.
The enemy knows our location.

09:29.992 --> 09:32.326
Whatever Dingaan saw
could be headed this way.

09:32.328 --> 09:34.061
Half our people are out
on reconnaissance.

09:34.063 --> 09:35.730
We're spread thin as it is.

09:35.732 --> 09:38.065
Everybody should get
to their posts. Be on alert.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.968
Let's go.

09:40.970 --> 09:42.803
That guy you saw...

09:42.805 --> 09:45.039
Was he really stuck like that?
He -- he couldn't move?

09:46.408 --> 09:49.076
It's okay, Matt.
We're not gonna panic.

09:49.078 --> 09:53.080
Whatever's out there,
we're ready for them.

09:53.082 --> 09:54.448
Right?

09:54.450 --> 09:56.317
Colonel.

09:56.319 --> 09:59.120
Let's go, boy.

10:01.223 --> 10:05.092
You really think
we can just be friends?

10:05.094 --> 10:07.361
If that's
my only option, yeah.

10:08.730 --> 10:12.400
You've always been
my best friend, Maggie.

10:12.402 --> 10:14.068
That's why
it's so tough.

10:17.906 --> 10:21.075
Incoming Beamer. We need to get
the hell out of here.

10:21.077 --> 10:24.111
Screw that. No way
am I playing defense anymore!

10:24.113 --> 10:25.246
You don't understand.

10:25.248 --> 10:27.214
Look out! Look out!
Incoming!

10:30.919 --> 10:32.920
Let's get back!

10:32.922 --> 10:35.402
- Clear some space, guys!
- No, let's get out of here, man.

11:30.111 --> 11:31.345
Hal, Maggie, run!

11:31.347 --> 11:33.914
Hal, stop staring.
Run.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.051
Let's go.

11:37.053 --> 11:39.186
Whoa!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:40.322 --> 11:42.523
Come on! Up here!

11:47.496 --> 11:50.531
Hurry up!

11:52.167 --> 11:55.836
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

11:55.838 --> 11:58.005
Hurry up!

11:58.007 --> 12:00.474
Come on, Hal. Hurry.

12:00.476 --> 12:03.377
What's wrong?
Why are you stopping?

12:03.379 --> 12:05.279
Are you kidding me?
We're stuck.

12:05.281 --> 12:07.281
It's like cement.

12:18.927 --> 12:21.128
The lord is my Shepherd.
I shall not want.

12:21.130 --> 12:24.431
He maketh me to lie down
in greener pastures.

12:24.433 --> 12:28.469
He leadeth me.

12:28.471 --> 12:30.938
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

12:30.940 --> 12:33.541
I will fear no evil,
for thou art --

12:36.345 --> 12:39.179
Get away
from the door, Matt.

12:41.049 --> 12:42.769
We're gonna have to barricade
these windows.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.552
Keep that fog
from seeping in here, buddy.

12:44.554 --> 12:46.654
Okay.

12:46.656 --> 12:48.522
Here we go.
We got it.

12:51.493 --> 12:54.962
Good. Keep going.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.601
Matt, come over here.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.470
Don't let that stuff
touch you, Matt.

13:17.954 --> 13:20.487
Run. Run!

13:48.209 --> 13:51.712
Did you really think
you could hijack our ship?

13:51.714 --> 13:53.881
And I wouldn't know
about it?

13:53.883 --> 13:56.083
Mira, what are you...

13:56.085 --> 13:58.051
Oh, my God.

13:58.053 --> 13:59.987
I've waited a long time
for this, Mason,

13:59.989 --> 14:03.223
and I'm
going to enjoy it.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.731
Oh, no. It's him.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.167
Don't you touch her.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.271
No!

14:19.975 --> 14:23.176
I don't have to touch her.

14:26.147 --> 14:30.684
Leave it! Leave it!
Leave it!

14:30.686 --> 14:32.853
My gun!

14:32.855 --> 14:35.756
Forget it.

14:40.696 --> 14:43.063
I'm stuck.

14:43.065 --> 14:45.766
I can't move my arms,
my legs.

14:45.768 --> 14:47.267
Neither can I.

14:47.269 --> 14:49.636
Oh, no! Oh, no! No!

14:49.638 --> 14:51.004
Anne!

14:51.006 --> 14:54.574
Anne!
Stay out of the fog!

14:54.576 --> 14:58.578
Anne!
Stay out of the fog!

14:58.580 --> 15:01.214
Shut up, Pope!

15:01.216 --> 15:03.216
Stop attracting them.

15:03.218 --> 15:06.586
Help! I'm stuck!

15:06.588 --> 15:08.055
We're in the fog!

15:09.223 --> 15:10.857
Help!

15:10.859 --> 15:12.726
Colonel Weaver?

15:12.728 --> 15:15.629
Yeah, right here.
I just can't seem to move.

15:15.631 --> 15:16.897
Wait.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.259
I think
they're gonna come in here.

15:18.283 --> 15:20.067
They're gonna get us.
I...know it.

15:20.069 --> 15:22.602
We don't know
a damn thing, Matt.

15:22.604 --> 15:24.037
Just hang tight.

15:24.039 --> 15:26.039
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

15:28.185 --> 15:30.377
I saw it happen
at the factory.

15:30.379 --> 15:32.813
They're -- they're gonna get us
and change us into these --

15:32.815 --> 15:34.614
Stop. Matt, stop.

15:34.616 --> 15:36.283
No. No, no, no!

15:36.285 --> 15:38.652
The knife -- you still got it?

15:38.654 --> 15:40.787
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Get it out.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.090
I got it. I got it.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.257
Aim for the heart.

15:44.259 --> 15:46.259
The heart?
Where's the heart?

15:47.229 --> 15:49.229
Just do it!

15:54.369 --> 15:58.205
Bull's-eye, Matt.
Bull's-eye.

16:04.045 --> 16:09.349
Before his untimely death, my
brother implemented a safeguard.

16:09.351 --> 16:13.887
That triskelion she wears --
it doesn't mean "peace."

16:13.889 --> 16:15.722
It never did.

16:16.692 --> 16:19.292
It means "control."

16:27.802 --> 16:31.338
Maggie? If you're gonna do
something, you better do it now.

16:31.340 --> 16:33.173
Do it faster than now!

16:35.110 --> 16:37.210
Ben!
Give me your hand.

16:43.118 --> 16:44.451
Maggie,
they're getting close.

16:44.453 --> 16:46.453
It's no use.
There isn't any leverage.

16:46.455 --> 16:48.088
Come on.
You can do it.

16:53.261 --> 16:55.228
You can do it! Come on!

16:55.230 --> 16:57.097
Attagirl.

17:02.036 --> 17:04.938
He's gonna need
both of us.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.674
Hal!
Whenever you two are ready.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.352
No. No, no.

17:19.354 --> 17:21.788
Don't hurt her
because of me.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.991
No. No, no.

17:28.997 --> 17:30.997
Anne!
Stay out of the fog!

17:30.999 --> 17:32.899
Will you shut up?!

17:32.901 --> 17:34.468
Why do you keep calling
for her, anyway?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.970
She's a sentry on the outpost
on the edge of camp.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.306
I'm just hoping she didn't get
stuck in this crap.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.308
We wouldn't be stuck
if you hadn't run directly

17:41.310 --> 17:43.810
into the very thing
I told you to run away from.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.346
Do you always go stampeding
towards things

17:46.348 --> 17:48.849
when you have no idea
what the risk is?

17:48.851 --> 17:50.383
Yeah, kind of.

17:50.385 --> 17:51.718
Idiot.

17:56.090 --> 17:58.458
What the hell is that?

17:58.460 --> 18:00.494
What the hell is that?

18:00.496 --> 18:01.123
What is it? What? Huh?

18:01.147 --> 18:02.828
Oh, no, no, no.
What the hell is happening?

18:02.852 --> 18:05.398
What is it?
No, no, no.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.920
Dingaan...Don't move. Don't move.
What?

18:06.944 --> 18:09.136
Don't even breathe!
Don't move!

18:09.138 --> 18:12.172
Dingaan!

18:12.174 --> 18:13.140
Dingaan!

18:14.810 --> 18:16.443
Dingaan!

18:31.159 --> 18:33.460
Every weapon has its weakness.

18:33.462 --> 18:37.230
I just found your Kryptonite.

18:38.533 --> 18:43.937
I delivered him here
just like I promised I would.

18:43.939 --> 18:46.907
I wanted to prove
how valuable I am to your cause.

18:46.909 --> 18:48.942
Huh?

18:48.944 --> 18:51.278
So why would you kill
the best weapon you have?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.047
To prove
you're stronger than him?

19:01.489 --> 19:04.858
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

19:04.860 --> 19:06.493
Matt, listen to me.

19:06.495 --> 19:09.362
I need you to stay tough,
Matt.

19:09.364 --> 19:12.499
You're not gonna throw in
the towel, not on my watch.

19:12.501 --> 19:15.402
You hear what I'm saying,
soldier? You hear me?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.371
I want you to repeat
after me.

19:18.373 --> 19:23.410
The fight isn't over
till it's over.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.945
Say that.

19:24.947 --> 19:26.580
The fight isn't over
till it's over.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.481
That's it.
Now say it with me.

19:28.483 --> 19:32.285
The fight isn't over
till it's over.

19:32.287 --> 19:35.589
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:35.591 --> 19:39.226
Keep chanting!
The fight isn't over till it's over!

19:39.228 --> 19:42.462
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:42.464 --> 19:45.398
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:45.400 --> 19:48.568
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:48.570 --> 19:51.471
Hold on, boys. I'm coming.
The fight isn't over till it's over!

19:51.473 --> 19:54.174
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:54.176 --> 19:57.477
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

19:57.479 --> 20:00.447
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

20:00.449 --> 20:03.316
The fight isn't over till it's over!

20:03.318 --> 20:05.318
Damn straight.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.255
Hal!

20:08.257 --> 20:10.991
Stop firing.
We got you.

20:10.993 --> 20:13.326
Hey, what, are you guys
filing taxes up there or what?

20:13.328 --> 20:15.195
Hal, listen,
we're tossing you a cable.

20:15.197 --> 20:16.496
You're gonna
have to trust us.

20:16.498 --> 20:19.399
'Cause it's so easy to trust you
these days.

20:19.401 --> 20:21.001
Dingaan!

20:24.673 --> 20:27.941
Aah!
You sons of bitches!

20:29.144 --> 20:31.411
Dingaan! Dingaan!

20:31.413 --> 20:34.981
Get it off me!
Get this off me! Aah!

20:34.983 --> 20:38.952
Get it off me!
Get this off me! Aah!

20:42.189 --> 20:43.590
Aah!

20:51.066 --> 20:54.100
Ugh, I can't believe
I just did that for you.

20:56.370 --> 20:59.506
We're even.

21:01.609 --> 21:04.577
I did this
for the Espheni race.

21:04.579 --> 21:06.146
These humans...

21:06.148 --> 21:10.016
They betrayed me.
They tried to kill me.

21:17.391 --> 21:22.095
I'm going to burn her
just like you burned me.

21:25.734 --> 21:29.536
I am Espheni!

22:14.443 --> 22:17.077
Stay with me.

22:18.179 --> 22:20.647
You're hurt.
I'm okay.

22:27.288 --> 22:30.023
We have to get out
of here.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.729
Lost a lot of time.
Our bomb is destroyed.

22:35.731 --> 22:39.433
Maybe we can use this ship
as a bomb.

22:39.435 --> 22:42.469
Yeah.
That's the only way.

22:42.471 --> 22:44.304
Can you set
the coordinates

22:44.306 --> 22:46.306
on a collision course
for the power core?

22:46.308 --> 22:48.208
Yeah.

22:53.749 --> 22:56.516
Yes, I can.

22:56.518 --> 22:58.385
But I'll need you
to release the Beamer

22:58.387 --> 23:00.827
from this ship's tractor beam,
or it'll get dragged down, too.

23:00.851 --> 23:02.422
I can't do that
from here.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.424
Inside the airlock,
you'll find a panel.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.593
You'll need to destroy
the wires inside it.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.128
That'll fire up
the Beamer

23:08.130 --> 23:09.396
so it's ready to go
when I join you --

23:09.398 --> 23:10.798
No, no.
I'm not leaving you in here.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.199
We have to divide
and conquer

23:12.201 --> 23:13.700
if we want to
get out of this alive.

23:13.702 --> 23:16.670
You're right.
This is the only way.

23:16.672 --> 23:20.140
I'm your daughter.
It's time for you to trust me.

23:21.242 --> 23:23.577
Make your choice.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.360
My god.

23:40.362 --> 23:42.496
I guess you won after all.

23:53.341 --> 23:57.477
No. I can do this.

23:57.479 --> 24:01.414
After I say goodbye.

24:08.723 --> 24:11.291
<i>Peksi alt c'oborat.</i>

24:11.293 --> 24:13.360
Fuquin! Fuquin!

24:18.566 --> 24:21.067
Ba Ba?

24:22.804 --> 24:25.572
Ba Ba?

24:25.574 --> 24:27.174
<i>Cheechock</i>
<i>IL sneetch-nitch chatico?</i>

24:36.417 --> 24:39.819
The fight
isn't over till it's over!

24:39.821 --> 24:42.389
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

24:42.391 --> 24:45.158
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

24:45.160 --> 24:47.627
The fight isn't over
till it's over!

24:47.629 --> 24:50.197
Anne!

24:50.199 --> 24:52.232
We need to get
the hell out of here.

24:52.234 --> 24:53.767
Sure you know
how to use that thing?

25:00.841 --> 25:03.610
There's a lot about me
you don't know, Dan.

25:03.612 --> 25:05.445
Yeah, I guess so.

25:05.447 --> 25:07.180
Hurry up!
If this is gonna work,

25:07.182 --> 25:09.549
we're gonna need to do it
together -- in tandem.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.152
When you feel it,
grab it!

25:12.154 --> 25:13.687
All right,
just throw it!

25:13.689 --> 25:15.455
Ready? Go!

25:15.457 --> 25:16.523
Okay!

25:27.336 --> 25:29.836
Thank you.

25:29.838 --> 25:32.239
It's great to see you two
working so well together.

25:43.784 --> 25:45.785
You okay?
Thank you.

25:45.787 --> 25:47.787
Anytime.
You okay, Matt?

25:51.360 --> 25:53.860
Come on!
Let me burn it!

25:53.862 --> 25:56.429
Be my guest. Get it.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.665
Take --
I'm out! Damn it!

25:58.667 --> 26:00.567
I'm stuck.

26:00.569 --> 26:02.636
Dan!

26:03.537 --> 26:05.739
I'm so sorry.

26:18.419 --> 26:21.621
Hope this works.

26:22.857 --> 26:24.557
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

26:24.559 --> 26:26.459
Lexi, what are you doing?!
We have to go!

26:26.461 --> 26:28.361
You destroyed
the tracking beam's security.

26:28.363 --> 26:30.597
I can manually release
the Beamer from here.

26:30.599 --> 26:33.266
Well, that's great, but you have
to be in the Beamer with me.

26:33.268 --> 26:35.302
I'm not getting
on the Beamer.

26:38.839 --> 26:40.507
The Overlord
destroyed the autopilot

26:40.509 --> 26:42.676
just before you killed him,
but I think I can

26:42.678 --> 26:45.211
command the ship towards
the power core myself.

26:45.213 --> 26:49.416
No, no, no, no.
There's got to be another way.

26:49.418 --> 26:53.253
<i>Do one thing for me.</i>
<i>Touch the cocoon.</i>

26:53.255 --> 26:55.955
<i>Please.</i>
<i>This is the only way.</i>

26:55.957 --> 26:59.459
<i>We're on reserve power.</i>
<i>We have to hurry.</i>

27:06.801 --> 27:11.004
I can't maintain this
for long.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.673
Listen to me. I'm your father,
and you don't know everything.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.475
I want you to do exactly
what I'm telling you.

27:15.499 --> 27:16.923
I love you.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.547
And I so wish
we could have been together

27:20.549 --> 27:22.282
long enough
to do what you tell me.

27:22.284 --> 27:23.550
There just
wasn't enough time.

27:23.552 --> 27:24.751
Listen,
this is my fault.

27:24.753 --> 27:26.753
If I hadn't asked --
It was the only way.

27:26.755 --> 27:29.789
If we hadn't done this,
it would all be over.

27:29.791 --> 27:32.992
You would have lost everything
and everyone you love with it.

27:35.496 --> 27:38.631
Not everyone.

27:38.633 --> 27:41.334
I've programmed
the Beamer.

27:41.336 --> 27:43.703
It's locked onto the homing
beacon to reverse course,

27:43.705 --> 27:46.039
and there's just enough life
support left to get you home.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.074
But you have to leave now.

27:51.512 --> 27:52.679
Don't do this.

27:52.681 --> 27:55.648
Thank you
for showing me

27:55.650 --> 27:57.984
what it means to be
a human being,

27:57.986 --> 27:59.586
for showing me
how to love.

28:01.822 --> 28:04.891
Goodbye, Daddy.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.018
The son of a bitch
called in backup.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.525
Dingaan.
What is it?

29:21.527 --> 29:22.593
Dingaan.
What?!

29:22.595 --> 29:24.094
Shh, shh.
Don't move.

29:28.300 --> 29:33.003
Folks, it's been
a financial pleasure.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.171
Come on.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.141
Aah,
you slimy piece of --

29:39.111 --> 29:41.111
Whoa!

29:41.113 --> 29:42.846
Who's there?!

29:42.848 --> 29:45.983
Be quiet!
I think you're attracting them!

29:45.985 --> 29:48.051
Sara?!

29:48.053 --> 29:50.153
Well, you remember my name.
That's something.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.958
Unbelievable!
It's quite the reunion, honey!

29:54.960 --> 29:56.760
What is that thing
on Dingaan?

29:56.762 --> 30:01.698
That is a...an earthworm
on human growth hormone.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.902
Please...Just shoot it.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.637
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

30:06.639 --> 30:08.805
Sara, now, hold on one second
before you do that.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.208
No, listen.
Listen, sweetheart.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.491
You don't want to squeeze
the trigger too hard, all right?

30:13.493 --> 30:15.933
Nice and easy, you understand?
Don't squeeze the gun too hard.

30:15.957 --> 30:16.980
Take it easy.
Okay!

30:16.982 --> 30:20.050
Let me do my thing,
or I will shoot you on purpose!

30:20.052 --> 30:22.152
Easy!
Just easy does it!

30:26.659 --> 30:28.992
Dingaan?

30:28.994 --> 30:30.928
I'm good.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.732
How did you find us
without getting stuck?

30:35.734 --> 30:38.635
I stole
a four-wheel drive.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.772
You're welcome,
by the way.

30:41.774 --> 30:43.774
Thank you? Thank you?

30:43.776 --> 30:46.677
That's -- that's your concern?
Well, you're unbelievable.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.178
Here we go.
Thank you.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.914
You just show up at
an incredibly convenient time.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.817
And what, we're supposed to get
down on our hands and knees

30:53.819 --> 30:55.652
and wet ourselves?

30:55.654 --> 30:58.055
Thank you!

30:58.057 --> 31:00.824
Don't act
like you didn't miss me.

31:10.101 --> 31:13.103
Anne...If I don't get
a chance to say it,

31:13.105 --> 31:16.840
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm very proud of you.

31:16.842 --> 31:20.310
Okay...
You're a brave woman.

31:20.312 --> 31:24.181
You've endured more than any --
any person has coming to them.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.083
And I honor you...

31:26.085 --> 31:28.251
As a woman...

31:28.253 --> 31:30.787
As a soldier...

31:30.789 --> 31:32.055
And as a mom.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.025
Oh, Dan. Dan,
don't talk like that.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.728
You can't give up now.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.463
It's not over
till it's over!

31:40.264 --> 31:42.099
I'm not, uh...

31:43.768 --> 31:48.372
Who said that?
Who said I was giving up?

31:48.374 --> 31:51.274
It's gonna take a lot more
than this stupid thing.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.876
Dan, Dan...

31:52.878 --> 31:55.245
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you. I'll tell...

31:57.215 --> 32:01.351
Once dad destroys
the power core, maybe...

32:01.353 --> 32:04.221
Those things out here
will turn into butterflies.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.391
No, but it could affect
whatever's causing this fog.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.892
Don't lose hope.

32:08.894 --> 32:11.028
Yeah, no,
we got to stay hopeful.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.030
Those things --
what are they doing?

32:13.032 --> 32:15.766
Sounds like they're trying to...
Climb up the side of the bus.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.134
No way.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.208
You were saying?

32:46.431 --> 32:51.134
<i>Are you being okay, Tom Mason?</i>

32:54.106 --> 32:56.006
I don't believe it!
Where did you come from?!

32:56.008 --> 33:00.210
<i>We'll be out</i>
<i>of this situation directly.</i>

33:01.913 --> 33:05.248
Oh, thank you, Cochise.

33:39.283 --> 33:41.451
You did it, baby.

34:10.947 --> 34:15.452
<i>Tom Mason,</i>
<i>can you hear me?</i>

34:15.454 --> 34:20.257
<i>Tom Mason, we're losing</i>
<i>contact with you.</i>

34:33.371 --> 34:34.871
Come on!

34:57.112 --> 34:59.480
Anne? Are you okay?

35:02.017 --> 35:04.485
It's gone.

35:04.487 --> 35:06.053
Matt, are you okay?

35:06.055 --> 35:08.889
Yeah.

35:08.891 --> 35:12.260
Dan.

35:12.262 --> 35:13.561
Dan?
Look out!

35:13.563 --> 35:15.563
Dan, it's okay.

35:15.565 --> 35:17.064
It's okay.
It's me -- Anne.

35:17.066 --> 35:18.165
Anne?

35:18.167 --> 35:21.502
It's okay. It's gone.
Anne...

35:21.504 --> 35:24.171
It's all right.
It's gone.

35:24.173 --> 35:26.874
Colonel, I-I-it's over.

35:26.876 --> 35:29.176
Matt.

35:29.178 --> 35:32.046
Here.

35:32.048 --> 35:35.216
That's right, son.

35:35.218 --> 35:37.385
It's over.

35:37.387 --> 35:40.388
Somehow...

35:40.390 --> 35:42.590
We made it.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.895
All right.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.397
Yeah.

35:49.399 --> 35:52.933
Let's get out of here
and see what's going on.

36:00.509 --> 36:04.045
So, that's it?

36:04.047 --> 36:06.547
All the Espheni tech's gonna
stop working just like that?

36:06.549 --> 36:09.050
The ghetto walls are down?
All those people are free?

36:09.052 --> 36:11.385
The ones who haven't been
skitterized already.

36:11.387 --> 36:13.120
I just hope
whatever gets unplugged

36:13.122 --> 36:15.423
doesn't happen so fast
dad's Beamer can't make it home.

36:15.425 --> 36:18.459
Ben, we don't know
what we don't know, all right?

36:18.461 --> 36:19.493
Matt!

36:19.495 --> 36:22.129
Ben!
You okay?

36:22.131 --> 36:24.298
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.

36:25.467 --> 36:28.369
You picked a hell of a time
for a reunion.

36:28.371 --> 36:31.505
Yeah, well,
there's some of you

36:31.507 --> 36:34.041
I just can't seem to keep
my distance from.

36:35.645 --> 36:38.179
Looks like they blew
the hell out of something.

36:38.181 --> 36:40.414
Which means
they'll be coming home soon.

36:40.416 --> 36:42.983
There still may be some
skitters and Mechs left to kill.

36:42.985 --> 36:44.585
Let's not let our guard down
just yet.

37:42.245 --> 37:43.911
Anne Mason.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.112
Cochise.

37:45.114 --> 37:49.150
I have news
about Tom and Lexi.

37:49.152 --> 37:51.118
I was able to reach
my father.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.453
The greater Volm
have returned.

37:52.455 --> 37:54.021
The Volm are back.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.423
What about my dad?

37:55.425 --> 37:58.459
I'm afraid
their Beamer was...

37:58.461 --> 38:00.661
Blown from
its homing-beacon lock.

38:00.663 --> 38:02.496
The explosion
from the power core?

38:02.498 --> 38:06.200
Correct.
The power core was destroyed.

38:06.202 --> 38:08.669
However, there was a skirmish
with the Espheni.

38:08.671 --> 38:11.672
Tom and Lexi's Beamer was spared
by my father's defense,

38:11.674 --> 38:15.676
but by the time
the battle had finished,

38:15.678 --> 38:17.411
their ship
was nowhere to be found.

38:17.413 --> 38:19.380
I don't understand.

38:19.382 --> 38:21.081
Are the Volm
not out looking for them?

38:21.083 --> 38:22.803
I mean, don't they have
the technology to --

38:22.827 --> 38:24.552
They are looking for them,
of course,

38:24.554 --> 38:27.154
but space is
not a finite environment.

38:27.156 --> 38:28.756
It's like a needle
in a haystack.

38:28.758 --> 38:32.226
Or more accurately,
a needle in the ocean.

38:32.228 --> 38:34.261
You said the Beamer
could make it back.

38:34.263 --> 38:35.763
You said --
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:35.765 --> 38:37.765
Matt! Matt! Matt!
Matt, Matt, Matt!

38:37.767 --> 38:39.233
You said --
Hey. Hey, listen. Listen.

38:39.235 --> 38:40.534
It's okay, buddy.

38:40.536 --> 38:42.136
We're gonna find him.

38:42.138 --> 38:44.972
We're gonna find him.

38:47.143 --> 38:51.045
If I know one thing
for sure...

38:51.047 --> 38:52.713
Tom always finds
his way home.

38:54.717 --> 38:56.350
And until he does...

38:56.352 --> 39:00.321
...we have to finish
what he started.

39:00.323 --> 39:02.590
We have to end this war.

39:08.296 --> 39:10.464
Anthony,
you made it back.

39:10.466 --> 39:11.699
Yeah, I did.

39:13.301 --> 39:15.436
A lot of others
didn't.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.273
I'm glad you made it.

39:19.275 --> 39:20.541
I'm glad you made it.

39:20.543 --> 39:21.809
Thank you.
Thank you.

39:21.811 --> 39:25.679
Well,
we got some work to do.

39:25.681 --> 39:27.681
The power core's down.

39:27.683 --> 39:31.585
And the Espheni
are sitting ducks for a change.

39:33.321 --> 39:35.523
Let's kick their ass.

39:35.525 --> 39:37.558
Let's go. Right.

40:17.099 --> 40:19.099
<i>You are safe and sound.</i>

40:19.101 --> 40:21.101
Who's there?
<i>We come in peace.</i>

40:21.103 --> 40:23.270
<i> We hold these</i>
<i>truths to be self-evident.</i>

40:25.034 --> 40:27.034
<i>The only thing we have to fear</i>

40:27.058 --> 40:28.576
<i>is fear itself.</i>

40:28.578 --> 40:30.578
<i>The enemy</i>
<i>of my enemy is my friend.</i>

40:30.580 --> 40:32.313
Show yourself.

40:37.485 --> 40:40.721
<i>Tom Mason...</i>

40:40.723 --> 40:42.256
<i>It's about time.</i>

40:42.258 --> 40:44.425
Oh, my God.

40:45.727 --> 40:48.462
I had no idea.

40:50.832 --> 40:53.734
You're...

40:53.736 --> 40:55.603
You're beautiful.
