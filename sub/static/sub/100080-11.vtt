WEBVTT

00:00.207 --> 00:01.568
Previously on SWAT...

00:01.592 --> 00:03.744
17-year-old Raymont Harris

00:03.768 --> 00:06.209
was accidentally shot
by team leader Buck Spivey.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.723
Now, this morning
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.123
Have you heard from him lately?

00:10.147 --> 00:11.999
I think he might be having
some type of financial trouble.

00:12.023 --> 00:13.563
Nate Warren. Street's brother.

00:13.564 --> 00:14.808
I'm in some trouble, man.

00:14.832 --> 00:17.878
Last week after I closed the
bar, two guys bust in.

00:17.902 --> 00:20.904
My boss Nolan, he's into
some shady business.

00:20.928 --> 00:22.728
He says I must have been in on the job.

00:22.752 --> 00:24.151
- Were you in on it?
- What?

00:24.175 --> 00:25.942
- No!
- Well, then what do you want me to do?

00:25.966 --> 00:27.266
Maybe you should talk to him.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.756
Where you headed?
It's your brother, isn't it?

00:29.780 --> 00:31.868
Why is it your job to save your
family every time they screw up?

00:31.892 --> 00:32.949
I said, leave it.

00:32.973 --> 00:34.073
You brought a cop?

00:34.097 --> 00:37.080
Relax.
You let Nate walk away from all this,

00:37.104 --> 00:38.832
and I don't tell my friends in Narcotics

00:38.856 --> 00:40.334
about your little side business here.

00:40.358 --> 00:41.335
Nobody move!

00:41.359 --> 00:42.636
Get your hands up! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:42.660 --> 00:43.782
You set me up again?

00:43.806 --> 00:45.962
- No, I didn't!
- We just came in for a drink.

00:45.986 --> 00:48.387
I will shoot you in the face real...

00:48.411 --> 00:50.132
easy!

00:53.650 --> 00:54.950
Go. I'm gonna take care of this.

00:54.974 --> 00:57.374
Go, go! All of you, go!

01:02.113 --> 01:03.290
Time.

01:03.314 --> 01:04.691
That's it.

01:04.715 --> 01:06.193
Chris, that's time. You're good.

01:06.217 --> 01:07.449
Chris!

01:08.452 --> 01:09.529
Hey, Deac.

01:09.553 --> 01:10.864
Any word from Street yet?

01:10.888 --> 01:12.466
- He's not returning my calls.
- No. And I just talked

01:12.490 --> 01:14.267
to Luca... he hasn't heard
anything, either.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.802
He asked me to keep him up to speed

01:15.826 --> 01:17.037
while he's rehabbing up in San Francisco.

01:17.061 --> 01:19.122
It's been three days.
How worried do you think we should be?

01:19.146 --> 01:21.008
I don't know.
Apparently, he left a message for Hicks

01:21.032 --> 01:22.209
saying he's just not coming in.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.377
So at least we know he's okay.

01:23.401 --> 01:24.811
- Physically, yeah.
- I knew something was awry

01:24.835 --> 01:26.558
when I heard his brother was in trouble.

01:26.582 --> 01:28.280
Look, we all know that Street's
got a soft spot for family,

01:28.304 --> 01:29.349
so we just got to trust him.

01:29.373 --> 01:30.884
Whatever he's going through,
he's gonna work it out.

01:30.908 --> 01:32.408
Okay?

01:36.480 --> 01:38.225
Look at that. Buck Spivey.

01:38.249 --> 01:40.994
Wait a minute. Look at you
all suited and booted.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.329
What, you got a calendar coming out?

01:44.044 --> 01:45.611
You know, the photo shoot
for that is next week.

01:45.635 --> 01:48.603
Ah. I knew I shouldn't have
dressed up for you smart-asses.

01:48.627 --> 01:51.071
You look like you're doing really good.
Yeah, thanks. I, uh,

01:51.095 --> 01:53.502
I finally figured out
that there's life after SWAT.

01:53.526 --> 01:54.908
I hope you two schmucks haven't forgotten

01:54.932 --> 01:56.320
all the lessons I taught you.

01:56.344 --> 01:58.278
There he is, the Buck we know and love.

01:58.302 --> 02:00.347
Well, listen, you haven't, uh,

02:00.371 --> 02:02.249
you haven't heard from Street, have you?

02:02.273 --> 02:04.352
No. Don't tell me our boy's backsliding.

02:04.376 --> 02:06.550
No, the kid's just gone AWOL
for a few days.

02:06.574 --> 02:08.588
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll, uh, I'll give him a call.

02:08.612 --> 02:10.524
But in the meantime,
Deac, you got a minute?

02:10.548 --> 02:12.893
I want to... I want to bend
your ear about something.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.194
Okay, there's my cue.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.695
I know when I'm not wanted.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.364
Buck, it's good to see you, man.

02:17.388 --> 02:18.954
Good to see you.

02:20.798 --> 02:22.663
Come on.

02:22.688 --> 02:25.379
I got a business proposal
that I want to tell you about.

02:25.404 --> 02:26.715
If you're looking for investors, Buck,

02:26.740 --> 02:28.384
- I'm the last guy to talk to.
- No, no.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.754
We, uh, we got investors,
we got plenty of them.

02:30.779 --> 02:32.557
What, uh, what we need is you.

02:33.178 --> 02:36.016
So, I'm, um, I'm hooked up
with a guy named Owen Bennett.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.118
He's an ex-Army Ranger,
solid as they come.

02:38.142 --> 02:40.087
And, uh, we're looking to launch

02:40.111 --> 02:41.721
a private security firm.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.057
You know, real high-end.
And like I said, the investors,

02:44.081 --> 02:45.525
they're-they're already in place.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.561
But what would really put things
over the top

02:47.585 --> 02:49.229
would be to have you on board.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.226
Active SWAT sergeant.
Police Star recipient.

02:51.251 --> 02:53.314
Buck, I don't think I'm ready
to give up SWAT just yet.

02:53.338 --> 02:55.068
Who said anything about giving up SWAT?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.470
I'm talking about a side gig.

02:56.494 --> 02:58.371
You know, hardly more than consulting.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.940
Fully within regs.

02:59.964 --> 03:01.374
When you sit down with Owen,

03:01.398 --> 03:02.909
he'll explain the whole thing to you.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.778
Look, I don't want to
waste the guy's time.

03:04.802 --> 03:06.613
I... I'm picking up plenty of overtime...

03:06.637 --> 03:09.082
Deac, listen, I need you
to hear me out on this,

03:09.106 --> 03:10.450
because it's, uh...

03:10.474 --> 03:12.552
it's not just about money.

03:12.576 --> 03:15.088
You were my number two
for how many years?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.791
Now you're Hondo's number two.

03:17.815 --> 03:21.228
Right? I mean, this is
a real leadership opportunity.

03:21.252 --> 03:22.796
This is something that SWAT
hasn't given you.

03:22.820 --> 03:25.098
I'm not here to sell you.
I'll-I'll let Owen do that.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.434
But just sit down with him and talk.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.291
That's... that's all I ask.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.305
Okay.

03:32.329 --> 03:33.607
Sure.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.275
This is gonna be great...

03:35.299 --> 03:36.765
for both of us.

03:41.205 --> 03:43.205
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.809 --> 04:20.411
Nobody move!
Stay the hell right where you are!

04:20.435 --> 04:21.666
Open the cage! Now!

04:22.580 --> 04:24.624
You want me to kill him? Open it!

04:24.648 --> 04:26.018
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry up!

04:26.042 --> 04:27.583
Hurry up!

04:29.186 --> 04:31.198
Get out! Get out!

04:31.222 --> 04:32.365
Come on! Move!

04:32.389 --> 04:33.466
Hurry up!

04:33.490 --> 04:35.035
Get out of there! Move!

04:35.059 --> 04:37.070
Hurry up! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

04:37.094 --> 04:39.027
Load it up, load it up, load it up!

04:46.561 --> 04:48.315
We got company! Let's move! Move!

04:48.339 --> 04:50.750
Move, move, move!
Come on, come on, come on!

04:55.679 --> 04:57.679
Robbery happening in Card Room One.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.596
Hey! Hey!

05:02.620 --> 05:04.698
You under the table,
you stay right there, you hear me?

05:04.722 --> 05:06.166
You stay right there. You don't move.

05:06.190 --> 05:07.756
You move, you die.

05:12.796 --> 05:15.108
Yo. We can't wait.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.524
Five-man crew just hit

05:31.548 --> 05:32.859
the Mandeville Card Casino.

05:32.883 --> 05:34.694
At least two dead. One of the gunmen

05:34.718 --> 05:36.763
- still holed up inside.
- What about the other four?

05:36.787 --> 05:38.431
- They got away.
- And left their boy behind?

05:38.455 --> 05:41.067
- That's cold.
- That's what separates them from us.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.636
The remaining guy's
locked in a cash cage,

05:42.660 --> 05:44.204
and he's got the drop
on multiple hostages.

05:44.228 --> 05:45.538
That's gonna make him a tough get.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.186
The cash cage at that place is wrapped

05:47.210 --> 05:48.905
in thick Lucite...
It's bulletproof for sure.

05:48.929 --> 05:51.311
Sound like an expert on the Mandeville
Casino. What are you, a regular?

05:51.335 --> 05:53.313
Hardly. But weekends draw
the college kids

05:53.337 --> 05:55.081
and bachelor parties,
and they're better at drinking

05:55.105 --> 05:56.832
than playing poker...
Helps my odds a little.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.085
- We're about 30 seconds away.
- All right, listen up,

05:59.109 --> 06:00.620
with Luca injured and now Street AWOL,

06:00.644 --> 06:01.988
we're out of our normal rhythm.

06:02.012 --> 06:04.324
That's when things can get
sloppy and people get hurt.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.481
Let's get our heads on straight
and stay liquid.

06:15.359 --> 06:17.694
Deacon, hunt down the head of security

06:17.718 --> 06:20.140
or whoever's in charge,
see what intel you can get. Go.

06:20.164 --> 06:21.574
Chris, Tan, Becker, you're with me.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.532
Let's get a look at what
we're dealing with.

06:27.004 --> 06:28.448
This is LAPD! Everybody stay down

06:28.472 --> 06:30.317
- and keep calm!
- Back the hell up!

06:30.341 --> 06:32.252
You hear me? Hey, back the hell up!

06:32.276 --> 06:35.093
Anybody comes anywhere near this
cage, I start wasting people!

06:35.117 --> 06:37.557
Listen to me, man.
We just want to talk to you.

06:37.581 --> 06:39.959
We want to resolve this without
anyone else getting hurt.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.629
- Think we can do that?
- That really depends on you, doesn't it?

06:42.653 --> 06:43.997
Hondo, Tan was right.

06:44.021 --> 06:45.999
Glass is bulletproof.
Rear wall is steel-reinforced.

06:46.023 --> 06:47.267
Thing's a fortress.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.635
He's got eyes on every approach.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.034
Whatever we go at him with,
he's gonna see it coming.

06:50.058 --> 06:51.064
Which means he'll have time

06:51.088 --> 06:52.806
to take those hostages down with him.

06:53.188 --> 06:54.708
We got to get creative.

06:54.732 --> 06:56.142
Tan, we still got those
hopper guns, right?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.510
- Yup.
- We got any paint rounds

06:57.534 --> 06:59.737
left over from that training
exercise we did with LASD?

06:59.761 --> 07:01.352
- Yeah, we got a ton of 'em.
- All right, go.

07:01.376 --> 07:03.238
Go get 'em. I got you covered. Move.

07:03.913 --> 07:05.390
Yo, man, it don't make no sense

07:05.414 --> 07:06.592
us yelling back and forth like this!

07:06.616 --> 07:08.849
We're gonna get you a phone, all right?

07:17.593 --> 07:19.438
Nobody's coming near you!

07:19.462 --> 07:22.509
We're gonna let the robot drop
off the phone so we can talk!

07:27.533 --> 07:29.648
All right, that's as far
as the robot can reach.

07:29.672 --> 07:31.839
You're gonna have to grab the phone.

07:43.052 --> 07:44.696
Tan, now.

07:44.720 --> 07:45.831
Go, go, go,

07:45.855 --> 07:47.699
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

07:47.723 --> 07:49.823
Going with the pepper spray.

07:55.631 --> 07:56.808
This is done, man!

07:56.832 --> 07:57.876
You hear me? It's over!

07:57.900 --> 07:59.211
Let's go! Come out slowly!

07:59.235 --> 08:00.879
Throw your gun out first!

08:00.903 --> 08:02.136
Don't be stupid!

08:06.008 --> 08:07.452
Move in, Tan.

08:07.476 --> 08:09.009
Move in.

08:22.277 --> 08:23.891
We're closed.

08:25.828 --> 08:27.595
You better step back off me.

08:28.831 --> 08:31.476
You got a heck of a sack
coming back in here.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.010
Both of you.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.913
Yeah, I figured we had
unfinished business.

08:34.937 --> 08:37.849
Yeah, the 50 grand in heroin
Nate's on the hook for.

08:37.873 --> 08:39.551
No. The way I see it,

08:39.575 --> 08:41.053
Nate's debt is paid.

08:41.077 --> 08:42.554
Consider it the cost

08:42.578 --> 08:44.155
of me cleaning up your mess.

08:44.179 --> 08:45.235
My mess?

08:46.009 --> 08:47.661
You're the one who killed those two.

08:47.685 --> 08:48.744
Yeah, I shot them,

08:48.768 --> 08:50.829
stopped them from ripping you off, so...

08:50.853 --> 08:52.531
that pays for Nate.

08:52.555 --> 08:54.333
Now he walks away.

08:54.357 --> 08:55.834
I walk away.

08:55.858 --> 08:58.537
You and I never have to see each other

08:58.561 --> 09:00.572
or speak of this again.

09:00.596 --> 09:04.525
And if you get pinched by
the cops on something else

09:04.549 --> 09:07.344
and think that you can flip this on me,

09:07.368 --> 09:08.936
I will kill you, too.

09:09.972 --> 09:11.576
Is that clear?

09:12.911 --> 09:14.519
Clear enough.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.088
But...

09:16.411 --> 09:17.988
before you go,

09:18.013 --> 09:20.614
there's something I want you to see.

09:26.722 --> 09:28.589
Keep watching.

09:34.463 --> 09:36.208
Nate, what the hell
are you doing here, man?

09:36.232 --> 09:38.410
I told you to go. This is my fault.

09:38.434 --> 09:40.612
- Let me help!
- Listen, I don't want you in this

09:40.636 --> 09:42.080
any deeper. Now get out of here.

09:42.104 --> 09:43.448
Come on, man, go! Go!

09:43.472 --> 09:45.651
This isn't happening.

09:45.675 --> 09:47.419
What do you want?

09:48.113 --> 09:50.422
You can't guess?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.613
You're working for me now.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.900
Never had a cop on the payroll before.

09:55.924 --> 09:56.928
It's not gonna happen.

09:56.952 --> 09:58.230
Couple of weeks.

09:58.254 --> 10:00.732
I have a new business partner
that I'm trying to impress.

10:00.756 --> 10:02.968
It's gonna do big things for me.

10:02.992 --> 10:04.770
It's gonna take preparations,

10:05.255 --> 10:06.505
protection...

10:06.529 --> 10:10.442
and you are just the man
to smooth the waters.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.728
Un-Unless, of course,
you want to explain this

10:13.752 --> 10:16.804
to your bosses at the LAPD.

10:23.383 --> 10:24.608
Two weeks.

10:24.899 --> 10:26.958
Two weeks... I help you

10:27.602 --> 10:30.295
but Nate leaves here right now
and never comes back.

10:30.319 --> 10:31.763
He's off the hook.

10:31.787 --> 10:33.950
He's free and clear.
You guarantee me that...

10:36.559 --> 10:37.969
...I'll do what you want.

10:38.413 --> 10:41.128
Welcome aboard, Officer Street.

10:45.234 --> 10:53.248
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

11:20.319 --> 11:21.396
Nice work.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.197
Heard it could've been worse
in a lot of ways.

11:23.221 --> 11:24.595
No hostages lost.

11:24.619 --> 11:25.939
Team made it back safe and sound.

11:25.963 --> 11:27.415
But two guards were killed
before we got there.

11:27.439 --> 11:28.552
What's all this?

11:29.461 --> 11:31.139
LAPD Cadets program.

11:31.163 --> 11:33.441
They're giving 'em
a tour of SWAT, chance to see

11:33.465 --> 11:35.376
what's really possible
if you put the work in.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.179
- Maybe you can say a word.
- Be happy to, once we get changed.

11:38.478 --> 11:39.822
Street, man.

11:39.846 --> 11:41.579
It's good to see you.

11:42.849 --> 11:44.393
Where you been?

11:44.417 --> 11:45.728
Why don't you, me and Hondo
go somewhere private

11:45.752 --> 11:48.097
and figure out what the hell's
been going on with you.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.800
I can't really get into it right now.

11:50.824 --> 11:52.401
I'm sorry?

11:52.425 --> 11:53.970
You've been MIA for three days.

11:53.994 --> 11:55.404
You left your team a man down.

11:55.428 --> 11:56.739
That's the best you can do?

11:56.763 --> 11:58.941
"I can't get into it right now"?

11:58.965 --> 12:01.190
Son, you better make an
attitude adjustment quick.

12:01.215 --> 12:03.279
Street, what's going on?

12:03.706 --> 12:05.037
I need the next few weeks off.

12:05.061 --> 12:07.283
There's a process to requesting time off.

12:07.307 --> 12:08.341
You know that.

12:08.365 --> 12:10.086
You fill out a request form.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.687
But I'm gonna save you the time.

12:11.711 --> 12:13.155
Request denied.

12:13.179 --> 12:14.857
- Commander, let's just hear him out.
- No.

12:14.881 --> 12:16.803
He's tested my patience long enough.

12:16.827 --> 12:18.289
You're not up to active duty,

12:18.313 --> 12:20.096
you serve your penance in the armory.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.598
One month cage duty.
Maybe then I'll think

12:22.622 --> 12:23.833
about assigning you active.

12:23.857 --> 12:24.834
I can't do that.

12:24.858 --> 12:26.836
I'm not giving you a choice.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.671
Now move your ass.

12:28.695 --> 12:30.728
Street, you be smart about this
and get moving.

12:35.702 --> 12:37.468
- You know what?
- What?

12:39.584 --> 12:40.868
I quit.

12:41.574 --> 12:43.552
Street, no.

12:43.576 --> 12:44.987
What are you doing?

12:45.011 --> 12:46.622
Come on, Street. You
don't mean this, man.

12:46.646 --> 12:47.623
Stop!

12:47.647 --> 12:49.058
Street, talk to me!

12:49.082 --> 12:50.982
Let him go, Chris! That's an order!

13:00.593 --> 13:01.971
This is crazy.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.806
He can't really mean it, can he?

13:03.830 --> 13:05.808
Even if he doesn't,
I don't see a way back.

13:05.832 --> 13:07.243
Hicks and Hondo, they gave him a do-over.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.711
He's not gonna get another one.

13:08.735 --> 13:10.313
I feel like it's my fault.
I should've stopped him

13:10.337 --> 13:12.189
from going down to Long Beach
alone that night.

13:12.213 --> 13:14.850
Hey, Chris, don't go there.

13:14.874 --> 13:16.819
We all thought that Street
had his head on straight.

13:16.843 --> 13:17.853
Nobody saw this coming.

13:17.877 --> 13:20.189
I did. But he just wouldn't listen.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.657
Hey. Come on, Chris.

13:21.681 --> 13:22.932
- It's not on you.
- Listen up.

13:22.956 --> 13:24.060
I'm not any happier

13:24.084 --> 13:25.428
about what just went down than you are,

13:25.452 --> 13:27.430
and we're gonna deal with that later.

13:27.454 --> 13:28.931
Right now, we got a crew out there

13:28.955 --> 13:30.599
that killed two innocent
people this morning.

13:30.623 --> 13:32.535
So let's focus on work

13:32.559 --> 13:33.691
and get the job done.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.871
Hondo, Tan, get a look at this.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.187
- That's our crew from this morning.
- Yeah.

13:51.211 --> 13:52.788
Wait a sec,
that doesn't look like anywhere

13:52.812 --> 13:53.789
in the Mandeville Casino.

13:53.813 --> 13:54.790
That's somewhere else.

13:54.814 --> 13:56.225
So they've hit before?

13:56.249 --> 13:57.727
Almost a dozen times.

13:57.751 --> 13:59.729
Today's their first strike in SoCal,

13:59.753 --> 14:01.130
but they've been hitting card clubs

14:01.154 --> 14:03.632
and Indian casinos all across the West.

14:03.656 --> 14:05.301
Always the same M.O.

14:05.325 --> 14:07.636
Five guys. Fast in, fast out.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.739
And they got no qualms
about shooting people either.

14:09.763 --> 14:12.074
They got at least ten bodies
in their wake.

14:12.098 --> 14:14.410
This is the guy we took out today?

14:14.434 --> 14:16.145
Carl Rollins.

14:16.169 --> 14:17.847
His rap sheet's pretty hard-core.

14:17.871 --> 14:19.315
This definitely wasn't his first dance.

14:19.339 --> 14:21.417
RHD's looking into known associates.

14:21.441 --> 14:23.486
Could lead us to the rest of the crew.

14:23.510 --> 14:25.588
Just got off the phone
with the Mandeville Casino.

14:25.612 --> 14:27.656
So, it looks like, this
morning, these guys got away

14:27.680 --> 14:29.425
with a little over 200 grand in cash,

14:29.449 --> 14:31.160
- another $20,000 in chips.
- Wow.

14:31.184 --> 14:32.495
They took chips?

14:32.519 --> 14:34.130
- What denomination?
- $100. Why?

14:34.154 --> 14:35.364
High value chips can be tracked.

14:35.388 --> 14:37.400
They have an RFID tag embedded in 'em.

14:37.424 --> 14:39.387
But a crew like this has to
be smart enough to know that.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.771
Maybe they got grabbed
up by accident, swept into a bag

14:41.795 --> 14:43.639
- while they were raking up cash.
- One thing's for sure.

14:43.663 --> 14:44.974
If today wasn't their first heist,

14:44.998 --> 14:46.828
it damn sure ain't gonna be their last.

14:48.538 --> 14:49.845
Hey.

14:49.869 --> 14:51.614
You got plans after shift tonight?

14:51.638 --> 14:53.349
No. Bonnie's got a work thing.

14:53.373 --> 14:54.750
I was just gonna order in.
I dug up an address

14:54.774 --> 14:56.919
on Street's old foster brother, Nate.

14:56.943 --> 14:59.255
I was thinking of heading down there.

14:59.279 --> 15:00.656
You want to ride shotgun?

15:00.680 --> 15:02.158
Yeah. For sure, I'm in.

15:02.182 --> 15:03.181
Cool.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.467
This isn't right, man.

15:11.491 --> 15:12.968
I can't do this to you,

15:12.992 --> 15:14.370
leave you hanging in there with Nolan.

15:14.394 --> 15:15.871
You didn't do this to me.

15:15.895 --> 15:17.139
You were in trouble.

15:17.163 --> 15:19.041
You came to me for help.

15:19.065 --> 15:20.893
The rest is my doing.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.711
Nolan's dangerous, man.

15:22.735 --> 15:25.714
I saw him take a baseball
bat to a couple drunks

15:25.738 --> 15:27.450
in the alley one night out.

15:27.474 --> 15:29.318
He beat their heads into a pulp.

15:29.342 --> 15:30.953
I saw him enjoy it.

15:30.977 --> 15:33.029
Guess it's a good thing
I got you away from him then.

15:33.053 --> 15:34.824
Jimmy, I'm serious.

15:34.848 --> 15:36.550
Look, I don't want
you hanging out with him.

15:36.574 --> 15:39.562
I make a living
dealing with guys like this.

15:39.586 --> 15:42.164
For the next two weeks, this is
just another mission for me.

15:42.188 --> 15:44.800
That's it. I just need you
to stay clear of it.

15:45.271 --> 15:46.504
All right?

15:48.431 --> 15:50.539
I was the big brother.

15:50.563 --> 15:51.907
I looked out for you.

15:51.931 --> 15:53.242
- Do you remember that?
- I remember.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.377
And I am grateful.

15:55.401 --> 15:58.338
I would've never made it
through the foster system

15:58.362 --> 15:59.548
without you.

15:59.572 --> 16:01.484
But we are not kids anymore.

16:01.508 --> 16:04.153
I made a choice, and I'm
gonna have to live with it.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.888
So you're gonna have
to live with it, too.

16:07.447 --> 16:09.035
Must be the food.

16:13.414 --> 16:14.730
Street.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.866
Whoa. What are you guys doing here?

16:16.890 --> 16:18.901
Looking for you.
Just trying to understand

16:18.925 --> 16:19.902
what's going on.

16:19.926 --> 16:21.036
Is this Nate?

16:21.060 --> 16:23.005
What have you gotten him
messed up in, huh?

16:23.029 --> 16:24.978
Chris, please don't. He's my brother.

16:25.002 --> 16:26.122
Foster brother.

16:26.146 --> 16:27.243
That means he's family.

16:27.267 --> 16:28.444
And we're not?

16:28.971 --> 16:31.072
You worked so hard to get back
on SWAT the last time.

16:31.096 --> 16:32.081
We both did!

16:32.105 --> 16:33.215
- I know.
- Then why are you

16:33.239 --> 16:34.542
throwing it all away, again?

16:34.566 --> 16:36.418
Look, what's done is done.

16:36.442 --> 16:38.793
- I am out at SWAT. That's it.
- Hey, come on, man.

16:38.817 --> 16:40.680
At least tell us what's going
on. What kind of trouble you in?

16:40.704 --> 16:42.063
I'm not in any kind of trouble.

16:42.087 --> 16:43.859
- We're trying to help you.
- Why is it

16:43.883 --> 16:45.194
so hard to understand?!

16:45.218 --> 16:46.929
I don't want your help, okay?

16:46.953 --> 16:48.864
All I want is for you guys to go.

16:48.888 --> 16:49.987
Just leave.

16:53.553 --> 16:54.752
Let's go, Chris.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.253
Hey.

17:12.278 --> 17:14.056
I got a text from Chris. She said you two

17:14.079 --> 17:15.624
went down to Long Beach
to see Street last night.

17:15.647 --> 17:17.292
- Yeah, it wasn't worth the drive.
- What do you mean?

17:17.317 --> 17:19.595
Well, he shut us down, almost
as soon as we got there.

17:19.618 --> 17:21.482
Maybe 'cause his brother
was there. I don't know.

17:21.506 --> 17:22.932
Did you at least find out
what's going on with him?

17:22.955 --> 17:24.934
Don't know, but something's messed up.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.602
It's like he just
doesn't want to be saved.

17:27.029 --> 17:29.004
You were right about the RFID tags

17:29.028 --> 17:30.406
embedded into the casino chips,

17:30.430 --> 17:31.807
but you were wrong thinking

17:31.831 --> 17:32.975
these guys were smart enough to know it.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.143
They cashed 'em in?

17:34.167 --> 17:35.144
One of 'em did.

17:35.168 --> 17:36.622
Tried to, anyway.

17:39.639 --> 17:41.050
What's this?

17:41.502 --> 17:43.185
Someone want to tell me why I'm here?

17:43.209 --> 17:44.954
You're here because you're stupid,

17:44.978 --> 17:47.690
which, in and of itself, is not a crime.

17:47.714 --> 17:51.026
But it led you to think
that you could cash in 20 grand

17:51.050 --> 17:53.996
of stolen poker chips
and no one would notice.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.698
Stolen chips?

17:55.722 --> 17:57.132
I won these.

17:57.156 --> 17:58.493
You won 20 grand?

17:58.517 --> 18:00.102
Must be hell of a poker player.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.938
Okay, let's say you open from the hi-jack

18:02.962 --> 18:04.807
with pocket tens to 20 bucks.

18:04.831 --> 18:06.308
Button three-bets you to 70 bucks.

18:06.332 --> 18:08.154
It folds back around to you.
What's your play?

18:10.906 --> 18:13.215
Come on, a shark like you ought to know.

18:13.239 --> 18:14.739
You won 20 grand, right?

18:15.808 --> 18:17.975
Guess I just got lucky.

18:19.312 --> 18:20.811
All right.

18:22.877 --> 18:24.193
See that?

18:24.217 --> 18:25.961
That's an RFID tag.

18:25.985 --> 18:27.696
Means these chips can be tracked.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.232
That means that we know, without
a doubt, you didn't win 'em.

18:30.256 --> 18:32.023
You stole 'em yesterday,
along with your buddies,

18:32.047 --> 18:33.802
and you killed two people in the process.

18:34.305 --> 18:35.904
We got you, Vincent.

18:35.928 --> 18:37.183
You're done.

18:38.225 --> 18:39.675
D.A.'s gonna look at you.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.143
They're gonna see a dozen heists,

18:41.604 --> 18:43.479
ten dead bodies.

18:43.503 --> 18:44.625
You're going away forever.

18:44.649 --> 18:46.415
Wait, wait, wait, wait. A dozen heists?

18:46.984 --> 18:49.418
Y-Yesterday was a one-off job for me.

18:49.442 --> 18:52.045
I-I don't know anything
about any other robberies.

18:52.069 --> 18:53.822
You trying to tell us you're
not a regular part of this crew?

18:53.847 --> 18:54.890
Swear to God.

18:54.914 --> 18:57.726
Guy I know hooked me in.
Supposed to be one-and-done.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.033
That's why I stole the chips.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.929
I-I saw how small the cut
they were gonna give me,

19:00.953 --> 19:03.766
and-and so I...
thought I'd give myself a bonus.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.034
The guy who hooked you in,

19:05.058 --> 19:06.253
what's his name? Where do we find him?

19:06.277 --> 19:08.003
You know what he would do to me
if I told you that?

19:08.027 --> 19:09.405
Nothing. Because he'd be spending

19:09.429 --> 19:11.040
a lot more time in prison than you.

19:11.509 --> 19:13.942
You have one way to
help yourself, Vincent.

19:13.966 --> 19:17.268
Please tell me you're not gonna
be stupid again.

19:21.074 --> 19:23.562
Yo, where's my damn food? I'm hungry.

19:29.716 --> 19:32.294
LAPD SWAT! Two, two, two!

19:32.318 --> 19:34.235
- LAPD SWAT!
- You're under arrest! LAPD!

19:34.259 --> 19:35.491
Tan, your way!

19:48.101 --> 19:50.412
Coveralls, masks, weapons.

19:50.436 --> 19:51.914
Some cash in this one.

19:51.938 --> 19:53.916
Looks like their winning streak
just came to an end.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.986
Casino crew just hit again
ten minutes ago.

19:58.010 --> 19:59.588
Charlemagne Card Club in Downey.

19:59.612 --> 20:00.756
Ten minutes ago?

20:00.780 --> 20:03.392
No way. How? That is them right there.

20:03.853 --> 20:06.117
Tell that to the pit boss
that just got shot.

20:12.624 --> 20:15.603
This is the heist that just went
down. Charlemagne Casino.

20:15.627 --> 20:19.007
Five guys, coveralls,
masks, assault rifles.

20:19.031 --> 20:20.508
Looks like the same crew.

20:20.532 --> 20:22.277
Looks like it, but look closer.

20:22.301 --> 20:23.678
Check the guy out on the right,

20:23.702 --> 20:25.013
- how he's carrying.
- He's left-handed,

20:25.037 --> 20:26.742
and all of yesterday's
crew was right-handed.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.483
And that guy's got a Glock on his hip.

20:28.507 --> 20:29.718
None of the Mandeville
crew strapped a Glock.

20:29.742 --> 20:32.220
So, two different crews
with the exact same M.O.?

20:32.244 --> 20:34.489
Oh, it gets weirder.
I pulled surveillance photos

20:34.513 --> 20:36.725
from a casino that was hit
five weeks ago in Oakland.

20:36.749 --> 20:38.560
Same deal... Coveralls, masks.

20:38.584 --> 20:40.828
The body types don't match at all.
That's another crew.

20:40.852 --> 20:42.364
It's almost like a burger chain.

20:42.388 --> 20:44.132
Everybody wears the same
uniform, does the same job,

20:44.156 --> 20:45.533
but they're separate businesses.

20:45.557 --> 20:46.701
The crimes have been franchised.

20:46.725 --> 20:48.470
Which means there has
to be somebody higher up

20:48.494 --> 20:50.205
- running all these ops.
- Yeah.

20:50.229 --> 20:51.728
I think it's time we find the CEO.

20:53.927 --> 20:55.971
According to your
homeys, you're the leader.

20:56.501 --> 20:58.813
Congratulations on that, my man.

20:58.904 --> 21:00.915
So, you're the one who put
together yesterday's crew?

21:00.939 --> 21:03.273
I can't stop people from talking.

21:04.877 --> 21:08.156
You ain't the brains of
the operation, that we know.

21:08.180 --> 21:10.325
There's somebody higher up
who did the heavy lifting,

21:10.349 --> 21:12.050
and planned that job,
so why don't we talk about

21:12.074 --> 21:13.559
who's really giving the orders?

21:13.583 --> 21:16.197
Gonna be a real one-sided conversation.

21:16.550 --> 21:18.366
'Cause I'm not giving you anything.

21:18.390 --> 21:21.336
Oh, you're afraid of them, is that it?

21:21.360 --> 21:23.057
"Afraid"?

21:23.808 --> 21:25.476
Never been afraid of anything.

21:26.811 --> 21:29.032
I just prefer loyalty.

21:33.806 --> 21:35.310
You believe this guy?

21:35.334 --> 21:37.719
Yesterday he helps
murder two innocent people.

21:37.743 --> 21:40.054
Now he's in there acting like his loyalty

21:40.078 --> 21:42.056
is some kind of virtue.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.558
Commander, what if we don't need him

21:43.582 --> 21:44.969
to tell us who his higher-ups are?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.581
He was only recently paroled, right?

21:46.605 --> 21:48.356
He got out of prison two weeks ago.

21:48.380 --> 21:50.318
Okay, and you got to figure that
the Mandeville Casino heist

21:50.342 --> 21:51.418
took some planning.

21:51.442 --> 21:53.154
So chances are they put
the whole thing together

21:53.178 --> 21:54.508
while he was still in lockup.

21:54.532 --> 21:56.157
We take a close look at any visitors

21:56.181 --> 21:57.492
he might've had in prison.

21:57.516 --> 22:00.094
His cellmate, texts, e-mails.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.085
And we find whoever's behind this.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.427
Sergeant Kay.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.170
Owen Bennett. It's good to meet you.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.505
Fair warning, I'm on call,

22:10.529 --> 22:11.806
so I might get pulled away at any second.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.608
Then I won't waste any time.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.810
I put together an info packet...

22:15.834 --> 22:18.946
The business plan, my bio, etcetera.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.948
But while I have you, while we're here,

22:20.972 --> 22:22.583
I want to get right to the straight shot.

22:22.607 --> 22:24.619
Looking to build a
high-end, high-prestige,

22:24.643 --> 22:26.287
private security firm.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.689
I've had a good amount
of experience working

22:27.713 --> 22:29.490
with professional athletes, celebrities,

22:29.514 --> 22:31.859
high-profile security functions.

22:31.883 --> 22:34.028
I see this as a chance to build off that,

22:34.052 --> 22:35.129
and really get it right.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.431
One question right off the bat.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.499
Why me?

22:38.523 --> 22:40.268
You mean besides the fact that Buck

22:40.292 --> 22:41.536
recommended the hell out of you?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.838
Honestly, part of it is marquee value.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.774
You're an active SWAT sergeant,
decorated with the Police Star.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.777
That'll go a long way with our
investors, potential clients.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.112
I also need your know-how.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.714
You're trained in personal protection,

22:52.738 --> 22:54.716
versed in every type of weapon.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.452
And, frankly...
you've got the right look.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.853
And what's that?

22:58.877 --> 23:00.321
People trust you.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.324
Tell me I'm wrong.

23:06.493 --> 23:07.995
That's why I'm offering you

23:08.019 --> 23:09.455
a partnership share.

23:10.372 --> 23:14.120
No doubt, the workload during
start-up will be heavy,

23:14.144 --> 23:17.004
but we can shape your schedule
around your SWAT shifts.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.340
Once we're established,
you could pull back,

23:19.364 --> 23:22.076
assume a strictly planning
and supervisory role.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.678
You make money

23:23.702 --> 23:25.313
while the people you've trained
do all the work.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.504
Where does Buck fit in all of this?

23:28.724 --> 23:29.984
I love Buck.

23:30.517 --> 23:32.053
He'll be a great addition.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.888
But you google his name,
the first thing you find

23:33.912 --> 23:36.346
is the Raymont Harris shooting.

23:38.016 --> 23:40.161
He can't be the name
or face of this company.

23:40.819 --> 23:42.096
You can.

23:42.696 --> 23:46.033
There are income and salary
projections in there.

23:46.450 --> 23:48.102
They're just estimates, but...

23:48.126 --> 23:49.337
I think they're accurate.

23:49.828 --> 23:50.927
Interested?

23:52.873 --> 23:54.375
I am.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.944
I want some time to look things over,

23:56.968 --> 23:58.913
- discuss it with my wife.
- Of course.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.571
This isn't something I'd have
you enter into lightly.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.430
First day on the job,
and you're already late.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.931
What kind of an impression
is that to make?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.933
Get your breath out of my face.

24:20.926 --> 24:22.186
Officer Street.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.372
Drink, or are you

24:24.396 --> 24:25.802
still technically on duty?

24:25.826 --> 24:26.874
I quit my job.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.409
So I heard.

24:28.826 --> 24:31.712
What? Did you think we
wouldn't check up on you?

24:31.736 --> 24:33.478
How about you just tell me
what you want from me?

24:33.502 --> 24:36.208
First, Barber's gonna
pat you down for a wire.

24:37.988 --> 24:39.753
All right, all right.

24:41.255 --> 24:42.222
What do you need?

24:42.246 --> 24:44.492
You used to work for Long Beach PD,

24:44.516 --> 24:46.561
so you know their patrol patterns,

24:46.585 --> 24:48.262
blind spots, vulnerabilities.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.832
Same, I'm sure, for the LAPD.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.667
So, if I got to move a shipment,

24:52.691 --> 24:55.570
you're gonna tell me
the best routes and times.

24:55.594 --> 24:58.573
You're gonna tap your sources,
and find out if there's

24:58.597 --> 25:01.242
any raids that would snag
any of my dealers.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.743
Is that all?

25:03.569 --> 25:04.846
That and any other damn thing

25:04.870 --> 25:06.647
I decide I want from you.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.856
That means that you have
to listen to everything

25:07.880 --> 25:09.817
that I say, too, smart-ass.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.252
Okay, keep your hands off me.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.042
Hey, maybe, maybe not.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.324
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Knock it off!

25:17.449 --> 25:19.861
Guys! Hey, that is enough!

25:22.654 --> 25:24.631
What the hell did you do?

25:25.323 --> 25:27.602
- Broke my damn arm.
- You get to the hospital.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.604
You get that looked at, and you,

25:29.628 --> 25:30.872
you cancel any plans that you have,

25:30.896 --> 25:32.962
because you are working late tonight.

25:36.318 --> 25:37.545
You got something?

25:37.569 --> 25:39.563
We're thinking we found our Mr. Big.

25:40.647 --> 25:42.283
A woman.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.352
Wait a minute, I think
I've seen her before.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.354
I ordered a deep dive of
Harden's prison records,

25:46.378 --> 25:48.656
looking for any outside
contact he might have had.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.658
Turns out he had a pen pal romance

25:50.682 --> 25:52.894
while in lockup,
e-mailing with this woman...

25:52.918 --> 25:54.061
Calls herself Rachel.

25:54.085 --> 25:56.425
E-mails contain plenty
of the usual X-rated stuff,

25:56.449 --> 25:58.165
but they get emotionally intense as well.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.233
Looks like she really hooked him in.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.369
So this is who Harden's been protecting.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.337
There's no actual
instructions for a heist,

26:03.361 --> 26:05.740
but she did tell Harden he was
gonna have to prove his love

26:05.764 --> 26:07.749
after his release before she'd marry him.

26:07.773 --> 26:09.677
So she basically seduced him
into pulling off

26:09.701 --> 26:11.312
yesterday's casino job.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.514
Is there any ridiculous thing
a guy wouldn't do to get laid?

26:13.538 --> 26:15.750
Yeah, well, in Harden's case,
he thought he found true love.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.318
And he's not the only one.

26:17.342 --> 26:19.020
Once we found Rachel's e-mails to Harden,

26:19.044 --> 26:20.855
we checked the prison
database for other e-mails

26:20.879 --> 26:22.857
originating from her same IP address.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.226
Saying she was two-timing Harden
isn't the half of it.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.094
She had similar e-mail romances going

26:27.118 --> 26:28.729
with at least 16 other inmates.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.598
E-mails every bit as hot and steamy

26:30.622 --> 26:32.233
as the ones she had with Harden.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.336
Romances intensify right before
the inmate's release.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.771
She leads them all on,

26:36.795 --> 26:38.272
grooms each one to pull off a heist

26:38.296 --> 26:39.540
as proof of their devotion.

26:39.564 --> 26:40.942
Here.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.077
I knew I'd seen her before when
I was going through the footage

26:43.101 --> 26:45.179
of the Mandeville robbery.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.181
Check out the brunette
with the rose gold watch.

26:47.714 --> 26:49.417
That's her.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.874
She watched the whole thing go down.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.457
Got some bad news for you, lover boy.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.581
We figured out where
your orders came from.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.631
Hmm. And I ain't gonna lie.

27:03.655 --> 27:06.968
Ooh, there's some juicy stuff
in those e-mails right there.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.820
Yeah, go ahead and take a read.

27:09.967 --> 27:11.978
Those bring back some good
old memories, don't it?

27:12.330 --> 27:14.616
But you better take a closer look,

27:15.313 --> 27:17.286
because none of those e-mails
are addressed to you.

27:25.350 --> 27:26.961
You know her as Rachel...

27:27.112 --> 27:30.065
but she was "Laura"
to a con at Pelican Bay,

27:30.090 --> 27:32.102
"Sadie" to another at Atascadero.

27:32.596 --> 27:35.241
"Ayla" and "Christine" to a
couple inmates at San Quentin.

27:35.379 --> 27:38.291
- No way.
- I mean, damn, that's game right there.

27:38.316 --> 27:39.393
She must have used a phone book

27:39.418 --> 27:41.129
to come up with some of those names.

27:41.154 --> 27:42.732
And she's got over 20 of 'em.

27:43.690 --> 27:44.839
Yeah, that's right.

27:44.863 --> 27:46.641
And 20 inmates just like you

27:46.665 --> 27:48.576
who believed that
they were her one and only.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.845
Looks like the player got played.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.647
She said she was gonna marry me.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.684
But only after you robbed
a casino for her.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.452
Right?

27:58.476 --> 28:00.343
What's your take on loyalty now?

28:02.266 --> 28:03.699
Tell us where we can find her.

28:05.630 --> 28:08.008
- I'll check with the front desk.
- Okay.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.498
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.345
She look familiar to you?

28:12.369 --> 28:15.269
- Yeah. Super sweet.
- She staying here?

28:15.293 --> 28:17.138
She was. She checked out
a couple hours ago.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.305
You sure about that?

28:18.329 --> 28:19.874
Yeah. I was right here
and watched her go.

28:20.682 --> 28:23.944
She's checked out, gone.
Probably cleared out of town.

28:23.968 --> 28:25.680
24-David to backup units.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.606
Suspect's a ghost. We missed our shot.

28:30.836 --> 28:32.402
Still one more casino in town.

28:32.429 --> 28:33.573
Maybe she'll be dumb enough to hit it.

28:33.597 --> 28:34.840
No way. After the other two heists,

28:34.864 --> 28:36.257
that place is on lockdown.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.866
Extra security and LAPD patrols... Hey!

28:40.870 --> 28:42.014
Hold on a sec.

28:42.038 --> 28:43.837
- Have a good day.
- Excuse me.

28:43.861 --> 28:45.318
Did you get this woman her car?

28:45.342 --> 28:47.553
Uh, yeah. Silver Lexus.

28:47.577 --> 28:49.472
A rental. Don't remember what company.

28:49.496 --> 28:51.691
She ask for any directions,
say where she was going?

28:51.715 --> 28:53.916
No. We didn't talk; she was
on her phone the whole time.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.094
Did you hear what she was saying?

28:55.118 --> 28:57.108
Anything about a casino or a card club?

28:57.132 --> 28:58.264
How'd you know that?

28:58.288 --> 29:00.166
I mean, she didn't say
anything about a casino,

29:00.190 --> 29:01.801
but she was talking about poker.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.713
What about it? Did she say where?

29:03.738 --> 29:05.504
I just heard her say something
about a private game.

29:05.528 --> 29:08.608
- Nothing but high rollers.
- Okay, thanks.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.684
She's changing up her M.O.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.226
Knows we're onto the casino heists.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.946
Private game could be anywhere.

29:13.970 --> 29:15.678
I'll reach out to some cops in Vice.

29:15.702 --> 29:17.639
Maybe they've heard something.

29:25.081 --> 29:26.459
Where we headed tonight?

29:26.483 --> 29:28.549
You'll know when we get there.

29:35.258 --> 29:37.036
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I've been thinking.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.971
If you're here, I've got to be here.

29:38.995 --> 29:40.373
Are you kidding me? Get lost.

29:40.397 --> 29:42.108
I'm sorry, but I've got to
look out for you, too.

29:42.132 --> 29:43.242
I don't need your sorry,

29:43.266 --> 29:44.910
and I don't need you
looking out for me, okay?

29:44.934 --> 29:46.968
I just need you gone. Go!

29:48.805 --> 29:50.416
I want back in.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.051
I want my old job back.

29:52.075 --> 29:54.475
That is not happening.
That was part of our deal.

29:54.499 --> 29:56.322
Nate is out, free and clear.

29:56.346 --> 29:57.923
You keep talking about our deal

29:57.947 --> 29:59.792
like you have some kind
of leverage; you don't.

30:00.323 --> 30:01.827
It's my bar.

30:01.851 --> 30:03.462
I have the video, I call the shots.

30:03.486 --> 30:05.498
Sure thing, Nate. You want back in,

30:05.522 --> 30:07.667
I can always use a couple extra hands.

30:07.691 --> 30:11.460
Go start the car.
I'll be out when I'm ready.

30:23.006 --> 30:24.617
We got any word on that private game

30:24.641 --> 30:25.750
that's supposed to be going down?

30:25.774 --> 30:28.518
Not yet. And there's no guarantee
we'll hear about it in time.

30:29.646 --> 30:31.791
Hey, uh, can I talk
to you about something?

30:31.815 --> 30:33.693
Has to do with Buck's visit yesterday.

30:33.717 --> 30:35.594
- Yeah. What's up?
- He put me in touch with a guy

30:35.618 --> 30:37.263
who's starting a private security firm,

30:37.287 --> 30:38.613
and he wants me as partner.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.466
- Is the guy aboveboard?
- Yeah, 100%.

30:40.490 --> 30:42.001
He's got a pristine military record.

30:42.025 --> 30:44.103
He's run security for
a couple of movie studios.

30:44.127 --> 30:45.204
So what's the hitch?

30:45.786 --> 30:47.039
Well, to be honest,

30:47.063 --> 30:48.941
the only reason he came to me is because

30:48.965 --> 30:50.342
I was awarded the Police Star.

30:50.366 --> 30:51.911
I guess he presold
some of the investors on it.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.145
And that's a red flag for you?

30:53.169 --> 30:55.981
I'm not sure how I feel
about monetizing the Star.

30:56.005 --> 30:57.349
I would have never received it

30:57.373 --> 30:58.584
if it wasn't for the whole team,

30:58.608 --> 31:01.654
and now I use that to cash in?

31:02.093 --> 31:03.533
I'm just not sure how I feel about that.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.224
Deacon, nobody around
here would fault you

31:05.248 --> 31:06.525
for striking when the iron is hot,

31:06.549 --> 31:08.194
getting a little something
better for your family.

31:08.218 --> 31:10.229
Especially after everything
they've been through this year.

31:10.253 --> 31:11.997
What's Annie think?

31:12.021 --> 31:14.300
Well, she's got her concerns.

31:14.324 --> 31:16.635
Mostly about the time
spent away from family.

31:16.659 --> 31:19.638
But she'd welcome any
extra money coming in.

31:19.662 --> 31:21.028
So what are you gonna do?

31:22.732 --> 31:24.810
Just heard back from
an old partner in Vice.

31:24.834 --> 31:26.212
Some heavy hitters are
having a card game tonight...

31:26.236 --> 31:27.513
A mansion up in Benedict Canyon.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.148
No way to know
if that's the right target.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.122
Yeah, well, I can think of one way.

31:33.610 --> 31:35.087
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:35.111 --> 31:37.423
there are still two players
who haven't bought in.

31:37.447 --> 31:40.092
Come on, now. Who are my stragglers?

31:40.116 --> 31:42.161
You guys almost got left out.

31:42.185 --> 31:43.996
As you know, buy-in's $100,000,

31:44.020 --> 31:46.587
and, as always, cash only, please.

31:51.693 --> 31:53.286
_

31:53.311 --> 31:54.607
All right.

31:54.631 --> 31:56.631
Let's do this.

32:06.910 --> 32:08.120
Hey, we got some bogeys approaching.

32:08.144 --> 32:09.922
Don't move.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.358
They're not paying you enough to die,

32:12.382 --> 32:13.793
so radio your buddy

32:13.817 --> 32:15.750
and tell him it's all clear.

32:17.179 --> 32:18.345
Do it.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.300
Never mind.

32:21.798 --> 32:23.291
It's all clear.

32:26.896 --> 32:29.208
You two, grab her.
Anyone else on this floor,

32:29.232 --> 32:31.143
- you keep them quiet.
- Get back in the kitchen! Go!

32:31.167 --> 32:32.733
Move it! Move it right now!

32:33.770 --> 32:34.814
Move it!

32:34.838 --> 32:36.215
Move it! Get in there!

32:36.239 --> 32:39.006
Sit your asses down
right now on the carpet!

32:45.849 --> 32:47.993
Empty. Must already be inside.

32:48.909 --> 32:50.618
Truck, clear.

33:06.014 --> 33:07.146
Tan.

33:07.170 --> 33:08.948
Check him out.

33:09.554 --> 33:10.950
There's five of them.

33:10.974 --> 33:12.952
All armed. On the inside.

33:12.976 --> 33:14.432
My man, get out of here now.

33:14.456 --> 33:15.894
Let's go.

33:21.117 --> 33:22.358
Hey!

33:22.382 --> 33:24.304
Hey, don't do anything stupid!

33:24.328 --> 33:26.131
Nobody has to get hurt!

33:26.155 --> 33:27.867
All right, everybody,

33:27.891 --> 33:29.602
hands on the table.

33:29.626 --> 33:31.284
Let's go. Get them on the felt!

33:31.861 --> 33:33.647
Hey!

33:33.671 --> 33:35.307
Tan, Chris, take the floor.
Find a way in.

33:35.331 --> 33:37.309
Deac and Becker, you're with me. Move.

33:59.989 --> 34:01.867
It'll all be over in a minute.

34:02.565 --> 34:04.803
Don't do anything stupid.

34:04.827 --> 34:07.696
We can all go home tonight.

34:12.568 --> 34:14.545
Hands behind your back. Come on!

34:16.839 --> 34:18.050
Got two suspects

34:18.074 --> 34:19.385
in custody in the dining room.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.719
All right, everybody, watches!

34:21.744 --> 34:22.987
Wallets!

34:23.012 --> 34:23.989
Let's go!

34:24.013 --> 34:25.090
Take them off!

34:25.114 --> 34:27.949
It's not worth dying for! Let's go!

34:32.522 --> 34:34.366
All right, let's go! Let's go.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.056
Come on!

34:39.462 --> 34:40.770
Cover!

34:43.393 --> 34:44.632
Move, move, move.

34:45.868 --> 34:47.280
Deacon, I've got the rabbit.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.695
Go.

35:00.540 --> 35:01.708
No!

35:02.251 --> 35:03.284
Let go of me!

35:07.239 --> 35:09.150
- Let me go! Let go!
- Get over here!

35:09.174 --> 35:10.306
LAPD.

35:12.266 --> 35:14.072
- Let her go.
- Back the hell up.

35:14.096 --> 35:16.224
You get out of my way now,
or I swear to God, I kill her.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.131
I'm not letting you take her out of here.

35:18.975 --> 35:21.329
Then we have
a real problem here, don't we?

35:21.353 --> 35:23.097
Listen to me, man. There's
no way out of here for you.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.494
Well, then, you need to make a way.

35:25.518 --> 35:28.202
I want a clear path to the door
and a car.

35:28.226 --> 35:29.711
Those rich idiots in the other room,

35:29.736 --> 35:31.792
you get a key off any one of them.
I don't care.

35:31.817 --> 35:32.847
That's not gonna happen.

35:32.871 --> 35:34.153
Your only chance to get out of here?

35:34.624 --> 35:35.602
Drop that weapon.

35:35.626 --> 35:37.291
I swear to God, I am not playing.

35:39.496 --> 35:41.362
I'm gonna give you guys five seconds,

35:41.386 --> 35:42.668
and then I'm gonna waste her.

35:42.692 --> 35:44.298
I don't think so. I'm gonna kill her!

35:44.322 --> 35:46.586
Go ahead. Go ahead, do it.

35:47.741 --> 35:49.648
- What?
- You're not gonna hurt her, man.

35:49.672 --> 35:51.205
She's the reason you're here.

35:51.229 --> 35:54.021
This was all her idea, wasn't it?

35:54.045 --> 35:56.110
Although, he might kill you
if he knew the truth about you.

35:56.134 --> 35:58.079
Isn't that right, Rachel?

35:58.515 --> 36:00.770
Or whatever you're
calling yourself this time.

36:05.463 --> 36:06.721
This is your last chance.

36:06.745 --> 36:08.155
Drop the weapon now.

36:08.179 --> 36:09.390
Who the hell is Rachel?

36:09.414 --> 36:11.013
What is he talking about?

36:14.948 --> 36:16.319
Nothing, baby.

36:18.323 --> 36:19.756
Don't listen to him.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.761
Freeze! Drop it! Drop it!

36:26.531 --> 36:28.631
Get up. Get up.

36:28.655 --> 36:30.111
You shot me.

36:30.547 --> 36:32.507
Just played the hand you dealt me.

36:41.112 --> 36:42.523
Catch you all tomorrow.

36:42.547 --> 36:44.644
Yeah. Take care.

36:48.398 --> 36:49.830
You plan on spending the night?

36:50.316 --> 36:53.489
Nah. Just not in a hurry to get anywhere.

36:55.697 --> 36:57.404
All right.

36:57.428 --> 36:59.306
Hey, Buck.

36:59.868 --> 37:01.786
- It's kind of late.
- Yeah, I just talked to an old-timer

37:01.810 --> 37:03.778
in Patrol. Uh, Street quit?

37:03.802 --> 37:07.208
I mean, you guys said he was AWOL.

37:08.376 --> 37:10.151
Yeah, things took a turn for the worse.

37:10.175 --> 37:12.019
Some trouble
with his foster brother, Nate.

37:12.043 --> 37:13.387
Mm.

37:13.411 --> 37:14.729
Did you know him?

37:14.753 --> 37:16.657
Yeah. Even back in his Patrol
days down in Long Beach,

37:16.681 --> 37:18.692
there wasn't anything Street
wouldn't do for his brother.

37:19.322 --> 37:20.622
That's too bad.

37:21.519 --> 37:23.609
Yeah. All right, I got to get home.

37:23.633 --> 37:24.862
- You good?
- Yeah.

37:24.886 --> 37:26.901
Hey, can I, uh, can I walk with you?

37:26.925 --> 37:28.229
Sure.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.172
- Night, Chris.
- Night.

37:31.196 --> 37:32.829
See ya around.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.662
So, I talked to Owen.
He said the two of you sat down.

37:37.686 --> 37:40.047
Yeah. Yeah, I told him I needed
some time to think about it.

37:40.071 --> 37:41.515
And?

37:41.951 --> 37:43.384
And I'm still thinking about it.

37:43.408 --> 37:45.304
Well, what's there to think about?

37:45.328 --> 37:46.887
I mean, it's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

37:46.911 --> 37:49.857
- A no-brainer, Deac.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

37:49.881 --> 37:51.649
It's just, you know,
I'm not sure yet if the time is right.

37:51.674 --> 37:52.769
Hey, hey, hey.

37:52.793 --> 37:54.528
Look, you owe me.

37:55.423 --> 37:57.031
You remember Koreatown

37:57.055 --> 37:59.177
when those jacked up 'Niners
had you dead to rights?

38:00.720 --> 38:03.170
Is that what this is about? Me owing you?

38:03.723 --> 38:05.005
'Cause, Buck,

38:05.029 --> 38:06.774
it seems to me that goes both ways.

38:07.393 --> 38:08.676
Yeah, I know.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.911
I'm-I'm sorry.

38:11.439 --> 38:13.414
All right? It's just, uh...

38:13.858 --> 38:15.916
I mean, I struggled a bit
since leaving SWAT.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.885
I mean, you-you know that.
This-this thing,

38:17.909 --> 38:19.520
this thing that I have
with Owen, I mean, this...

38:19.544 --> 38:21.222
this could be big for me.

38:21.246 --> 38:22.690
I mean, come on, Deac.
I mean, you heard him.

38:22.714 --> 38:25.526
This could be... this could be
big for both of us.

38:25.550 --> 38:27.532
I'm not asking you for a favor here.

38:27.556 --> 38:29.886
I'm asking you to say yes
to an incredible opportunity.

38:34.071 --> 38:35.095
All right.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.104
Call Owen. Tell him I'm in.

38:37.128 --> 38:39.640
For-for real? Um, definite?

38:39.664 --> 38:41.464
Yeah, for real.

38:43.304 --> 38:44.712
- Let's do this.
- That's great.

38:44.736 --> 38:45.946
This is... It's great news.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.648
You-you won't regret it.

38:48.351 --> 38:50.006
Thanks.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.567
Now what?

39:06.591 --> 39:09.205
Now we stop asking questions.

39:17.059 --> 39:18.339
Stay here.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.496
Where's Barber?

39:49.412 --> 39:51.111
Barber had an accident.

39:51.789 --> 39:53.113
What kind of an accident?

39:53.137 --> 39:55.404
The "messing with me" kind.

39:58.055 --> 39:59.321
So you're the cop.

40:03.247 --> 40:04.927
Ex-cop.

40:20.164 --> 40:21.542
What are you waiting for?

40:21.566 --> 40:23.321
Drive.

41:27.398 --> 41:29.209
Nolan bought it.
