<i>Iam Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:03.797 --> 00:08.260
<i>I have sworn my sword to Alfred
and defeated Sigefrid and Erik</i>

00:08.385 --> 00:11.096
<i>but now the brothers
have returned from banishment</i>

00:11.221 --> 00:13.807
<i>and with a great army,
they have taken the city of Lundene.</i>

00:13.932 --> 00:16.018
The gods are with us!

00:16.143 --> 00:19.479
<i>Alfred dispatched</i> a <i>priest
to negotiate with these Northmen...</i>

00:19.605 --> 00:21.815
Father Pyrlig
was once a warrior himself.

00:21.940 --> 00:25.194
<i>...while continuing his mission
to be king of all the English.</i>

00:25.319 --> 00:29.198
- I am to be married.
- Which one of you is Aethelred?

00:29.323 --> 00:32.201
From what I know, Alfred could not
have chosen a bigger turd.

00:32.326 --> 00:37.748
<i>Having at last freed my sister Thyra,
my friend Beocca found love.</i>

00:37.873 --> 00:40.167
I fear you have become
someone I cannot live without.

00:40.292 --> 00:41.293
Fear no more.

00:41.418 --> 00:44.213
<i>Whereas I found myself
talking to the dead</i>

00:44.338 --> 00:47.466
<i>and wanting to believe
every word that he spoke.</i>

00:47.591 --> 00:51.303
He said that I should be king of Wessex
and that you, you should be a king, too.

00:51.428 --> 00:55.641
King of Mercia. King of Saxon and Dane.

00:55.766 --> 00:58.560
What we have just witnessed,
you believe it to be true?

00:58.685 --> 01:02.439
<i>Now I must decide
where my loyalties lie.</i>

01:02.564 --> 01:05.483
Do not forget you were raised as a Dane.

01:05.609 --> 01:07.611
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

02:01.748 --> 02:03.917
You've barely washed, woman.

02:06.336 --> 02:08.338
You have been living with Saxons
for too long.

02:08.463 --> 02:10.590
How can I wash in dirty waters?

02:10.716 --> 02:14.511
The water is good.
We are a long way from the city.

02:16.555 --> 02:17.848
(GISELA SHRIEKS)

02:25.188 --> 02:27.649
We will be late for the wedding.

02:28.817 --> 02:30.819
I've been thinking
about the man in the grave.

02:30.944 --> 02:33.238
- Bjorn.
- Uhtred, no.

02:33.363 --> 02:36.533
- You would not like to be a queen?
- Of Bebbanburg, yes.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.869
(CHUCKLES)

02:38.994 --> 02:43.206
Let us just enjoy an early morning.
The two of us.

02:43.332 --> 02:45.375
(HORSES WHINNY IN DISTANCE)

02:46.668 --> 02:51.214
- And a hunting party.
- Who is it?

02:51.340 --> 02:54.801
It's Aethelred. The lord of Mercia.

02:56.553 --> 03:00.682
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
Word has been that you were missing.

03:00.807 --> 03:05.312
Aethelred, I see you managed to
remove your head from the king's arse.

03:05.437 --> 03:07.731
Well, for the moment. He's sleeping.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.107
(LAUGHTER)

03:09.232 --> 03:11.360
The king has questions
about your loyalty.

03:11.485 --> 03:12.778
It's his way.

03:12.903 --> 03:16.740
AETHELRED: And he tells me you've been
associating with those heathen Danes.

03:16.865 --> 03:21.244
- Like this one here.
- (MEN SNIGGER)

03:21.370 --> 03:23.622
Uhtred, we are needed elsewhere.

03:23.747 --> 03:25.874
Is he required between your legs,
my dear?

03:25.999 --> 03:27.918
(SNIGGERING)

03:34.508 --> 03:36.927
At ease, men.

03:38.178 --> 03:41.014
- You wouldn't dare.
- What? Take your nose?

03:41.973 --> 03:44.393
- I think I might.
- Uhtred, we are needed.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.561
Lord Uhtred,
you will let Lord Aethelred go.

03:48.897 --> 03:50.357
Please.

03:51.608 --> 03:53.485
Lady, on behalf of my lord,
I apologize.

03:53.610 --> 03:54.694
- He does not.
- No?

03:54.820 --> 03:56.405
ALDHELM: There can be no bloodshed here.

03:56.530 --> 03:59.908
We are all mistaken
and we are all proud.

04:01.993 --> 04:04.663
What men say is true.

04:04.788 --> 04:07.457
You behave as if
you were still at your mother's tit.

04:11.253 --> 04:13.380
You will learn respect one day,
I'm sure.

04:14.089 --> 04:18.593
- Lord, it is over, is it not?
- It is.

04:26.726 --> 04:30.564
I have the king's trust!
That's a warning!

04:46.830 --> 04:50.459
- I want him dead.
- Too soon.

04:51.418 --> 04:56.131
I'm sure Alfred would prefer him dead
at times, but he knows his value.

04:56.256 --> 04:59.050
- He's nothing but a heathen.
- Uhtred kills Danes.

04:59.176 --> 05:03.472
He kills Danes, he survives slavery,

05:03.597 --> 05:05.765
he saves the life
of children and mice no doubt.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.017
(CHUCKLES)

05:08.101 --> 05:10.896
Even my wife-to-be sings his praises.

05:14.232 --> 05:15.525
Leave us.

05:18.570 --> 05:22.866
I do not like him
and he doesn't like me.

05:22.991 --> 05:24.367
From the moment that we met.

05:25.494 --> 05:30.582
You are a threat, lord,
and he is the same.

05:33.585 --> 05:36.046
Our hope lies in Daneland.

05:36.838 --> 05:41.051
With luck, the unrest will grow.
Peace is not in their nature.

05:41.176 --> 05:45.013
- You wish for war, Aldhelm?
- As a Mercian, lord,

05:45.138 --> 05:49.017
what I wish is for Aethelred
to be crowned king of Mercia.

05:50.435 --> 05:53.063
And then of Wessex.

05:54.481 --> 05:55.732
Why not?

06:00.862 --> 06:03.823
It is Alfred we want dead

06:03.949 --> 06:08.787
and for that to happen sooner,
we will require war.

06:14.501 --> 06:16.711
How do we look?

06:21.550 --> 06:23.260
As royalty.

06:26.096 --> 06:28.682
Aethelflaed is a fortunate young woman.

06:39.943 --> 06:41.236
UHTRED: I am witness.

06:41.361 --> 06:45.031
You are together, never to part,

06:45.156 --> 06:48.952
bound as man and his wife.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.457
- And a prayer?
- I don't know any prayers.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.251
(LAUGHTER)

06:56.376 --> 06:58.378
I will say a prayer.

07:00.589 --> 07:03.508
Hild. Please.

07:04.426 --> 07:09.097
Let us pray that God and all His saints
and all His angels in Heaven

07:09.222 --> 07:10.974
smile and bless you.

07:11.099 --> 07:15.520
Let us pray that this union
of Dane and Saxon

07:15.645 --> 07:18.940
can show that this is a land
for all people.

07:19.065 --> 07:22.277
- Under one God.
- Under one God, of course.

07:22.402 --> 07:24.696
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:24.821 --> 07:26.865
Amen.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.212
When are you going to tell him
what Sihtric saw?

07:41.338 --> 07:43.923
That the ghost is a lie.

07:44.049 --> 07:47.594
If I tell him, he'll talk
and Sigefrid will hear.

07:50.138 --> 07:52.515
They must believe that we believe.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.187
I do enjoy another wedding.

07:57.312 --> 08:00.982
A royal wedding in particular.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.609
It is a tonic for the soul.

08:02.734 --> 08:04.361
The excitement, the expense...

08:04.486 --> 08:08.615
Aethelwold, I am still undecided,
so do not mention talking corpses.

08:12.035 --> 08:15.872
Nobles have traveled
across the sea from as far as Frankia

08:15.997 --> 08:18.124
solely to see the beautiful Aethelflaed

08:18.249 --> 08:20.960
marry this pretty
bread-pudding of a boy.

08:21.086 --> 08:22.629
A fair description.

08:22.754 --> 08:27.550
Furthennore, he gets to hump
the king's daughter all night long.

08:27.676 --> 08:30.136
- Aethelwold, you will be quiet.
- It is the truth.

08:30.261 --> 08:33.097
- You will be quiet.
- Or you will do what, Irishman?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.600
Kill you in your sleep.

08:36.768 --> 08:40.230
(BANGING ON DOOR)

09:16.266 --> 09:20.603
- She is so beautiful.
- She is too good for him.

09:20.729 --> 09:22.105
Why are we delaying?

09:22.230 --> 09:25.108
Did Sihtric witness something
at the graveside?

09:25.233 --> 09:28.737
- Sihtric saw nothing.
- (SIGHS)

09:47.297 --> 09:49.549
May I say that you look quite beautiful.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.637
God looks upon me
with favor I do not deserve.

09:58.308 --> 10:00.727
Lord God in your Heaven,

10:00.852 --> 10:08.026
we are humbly gathered before you
on this day of thanks and celebration...

10:08.234 --> 10:11.112
- (RAUCOUS CHATTER)
- WOMAN: A gift from the king!

10:11.237 --> 10:14.365
If you don't mind.

10:17.076 --> 10:18.828
(MEN SHOUT)

10:24.667 --> 10:27.170
The point I make is simple.

10:27.295 --> 10:29.047
All of the power, all of the wealth,

10:29.172 --> 10:31.966
all the land that could belong to you,
will now belong to him.

10:32.091 --> 10:35.136
- Should I hit him?
- Yes! Yes, by all means, strike me.

10:35.261 --> 10:38.848
But in your heart, in your purse,
you know I speak the truth.

10:38.973 --> 10:39.933
Yes, hit him.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.727
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

10:43.853 --> 10:46.189
AETHELWOLD: All I will say, again,

10:46.314 --> 10:49.651
is that the dead man speaks the truth.

10:49.776 --> 10:51.694
- Lord?
- Some would say it is treason.

10:51.820 --> 10:55.031
- No, no, this wedding is treason.
- Lord?

10:55.156 --> 10:58.785
This wedding is a betrayal of Wessex
and the men of Wessex.

10:58.910 --> 11:00.119
Meaning you.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.622
Should the king die,
I have a strong and rightful claim.

11:02.747 --> 11:05.416
Alfred is working to make
a new line of succession.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.710
- Excuse me, Lord Uhtred.
- Go away.

11:07.836 --> 11:11.798
- I am Osferth.
- You are a monk. A baby monk.

11:12.841 --> 11:16.594
- Go away.
- Lord, you knew my uncle, lord.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.430
His name was Leofric.

11:19.556 --> 11:21.307
Leofric was a great man.

11:23.101 --> 11:28.064
- You are Alfred's bastard son.
- No, but I wish to join you, lord.

11:28.189 --> 11:31.067
- Be by your side as my uncle was.
- No, we have no need of a monk.

11:31.192 --> 11:34.153
As a warrior, lord.

11:34.279 --> 11:37.198
I wish to serve you as a warrior.

11:39.409 --> 11:40.827
Uhtred.

11:41.953 --> 11:44.289
Uhtred, you are wanted.

11:46.332 --> 11:48.668
- The king!
- Enjoy the wedding feast.

11:51.337 --> 11:57.093
You. Find me again, bring a sword
and lose your cross.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.470
Thank you, my lord. lwill.

11:59.596 --> 12:01.472
(LIVELY CHATTER)

12:14.903 --> 12:16.279
ALFRED: Lord.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.953
- Lord.
- You were seen.

12:24.078 --> 12:25.288
Seen where, lord?

12:25.413 --> 12:28.082
Leaving Winchester, leaving Wessex,

12:28.207 --> 12:31.210
entering Saxon Mercia
and crossing Watling Street.

12:31.336 --> 12:36.090
Going into Daneland, Uhtred.
I'm sure you have an explanation.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.343
I trust we will hear the truth of it.

12:38.468 --> 12:40.345
ALFRED: What business do you have
in Daneland?

12:40.470 --> 12:45.391
The king's business.
Lord, your business.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.518
You're happy for me
to speak in this company?

12:50.521 --> 12:52.190
Freely. Why not?

12:57.946 --> 13:02.617
Lundene has been taken.
By the Northmen, Sigefrid and Erik.

13:02.742 --> 13:05.995
- Never. Says who?
- Did my lips not move?

13:06.120 --> 13:10.124
- Sigefrid and Erik are in Frankia.
- They were and now they are not, lord.

13:10.249 --> 13:13.753
They have a fleet at Beamfleot,
they have an army at Beamfleot,

13:13.878 --> 13:15.964
some of which has sailed upriver
and taken Lundene.

13:16.089 --> 13:19.342
If this is true,
it cannot be allowed.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.470
- Lundene belongs to Mercia.
- They will choke the river.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.013
They will, lord.

13:25.390 --> 13:27.600
ALDHELM: With respect, Lord Uhtred,

13:27.725 --> 13:31.062
you have still not explained why
you crossed the street into Daneland.

13:31.187 --> 13:34.232
- I can never remember your name.
- I am Aldhelm.

13:34.357 --> 13:37.193
I'm commander
of Lord Aethelred's household guard.

13:37.318 --> 13:40.571
- Would you like me to write it down?
- AELSWITH: You will answer, Uhtred.

13:40.697 --> 13:43.783
I was invited to Daneland, lady,
to Padintune.

13:45.451 --> 13:48.371
And there I was asked
to join with Sigefrid and Erik.

13:49.247 --> 13:51.457
- I was offered the kingdom of Mercia.
- (SCOFFS)

13:51.582 --> 13:53.876
- ALDHELM: And your response?
- He is here, is he not?

13:54.002 --> 13:57.296
I would say that is response enough.

13:57.422 --> 14:02.635
Uhtred, I did not see you at the church.
I do hope you were there.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.179
I was there, lady, of course I was.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.724
And may I say
how beautiful you are today.

14:07.849 --> 14:08.850
AETHELFLAED: Thank you.

14:08.975 --> 14:12.729
My dear, we are discussing
a matter of importance.

14:12.854 --> 14:13.855
Yes, I heard, lord.

14:13.980 --> 14:17.525
So are the Northmen intending
to remain in Lundene

14:17.650 --> 14:19.902
or are they waiting for a ransom?

14:20.028 --> 14:21.070
UHTRED: A fair question.

14:21.195 --> 14:25.408
Besides Uhtred's loyalties,
it is the only question.

14:25.533 --> 14:28.244
- We shall offer negotiations.
- Quite right.

14:28.369 --> 14:31.122
Once the celebrations are done,
you, together with Aethelred,

14:31.247 --> 14:34.125
shall travel to Lundene.
Assess their strength and their numbers.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.169
An excellent way forward, lord.

14:36.294 --> 14:38.629
Though if you had killed these brothers
in Northumbria,

14:38.755 --> 14:41.090
this event could not have occurred.

14:47.972 --> 14:54.020
Lord King, may I ask,
what bargain was struck in Northumbria

14:54.145 --> 14:56.064
to allow the brothers
to leave with their lives?

14:56.189 --> 14:57.940
AETHELFLAED:
Uhtred has told me this story.

14:58.066 --> 15:01.319
He defeated Sigefrid in combat
but spared him

15:01.444 --> 15:02.653
on the condition they leave.

15:02.779 --> 15:05.531
He did this to preserve
the lives of his own men.

15:05.656 --> 15:09.243
- Ah.
- ODDA: It is called negotiation,

15:09.368 --> 15:10.828
Lord Aldhelm.

15:11.746 --> 15:14.707
And now we suffer the consequences
of this negotiation.

15:14.832 --> 15:17.835
Decisions are made
and consequences follow. It is the way.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.756
Our task is to deal with the present.

15:21.881 --> 15:24.801
To your wisdom, lord.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.570
My dear.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.573
It's not your place to involve yourself

15:47.698 --> 15:51.619
in a conversation
that became an informal Witan.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.663
We were discussing matters
of land and war.

15:53.788 --> 15:56.707
Lord, I take an interest
in these matters.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.960
My father has always encouraged...

15:59.085 --> 16:01.587
You are no longer the king's daughter.

16:03.089 --> 16:04.465
You are my wife.

16:06.551 --> 16:09.011
It's me you will obey.

16:09.137 --> 16:10.721
And you are delicate.

16:10.847 --> 16:14.392
I find it interesting.
I would speak with the king often...

16:14.517 --> 16:18.896
You are of Mercia now.
You are my queen.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.065
(CHUCKLES) Do you think you're a king?

16:27.655 --> 16:30.700
I call you "queen"
because you mean that much to me.

16:33.286 --> 16:36.289
I do not like your tone nor accusation.

16:39.417 --> 16:40.835
What I would like...

16:42.170 --> 16:43.379
is you

16:43.504 --> 16:47.175
on your belly... on the bed.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.551
Lord...

16:48.676 --> 16:51.429
Your husband wishes to ride you.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.224
You will lie on your belly.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.607
What's this? Disobedience?

17:04.150 --> 17:05.943
It's confusion, lord.

17:06.068 --> 17:09.113
Should I hand you back to Wessex?

17:10.615 --> 17:13.075
Unused but... tarnished?

17:13.201 --> 17:15.744
You wouldn't dare.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.080
We shall see.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.917
Lord!

17:25.880 --> 17:27.839
I am your wife.

17:32.887 --> 17:34.263
(AETHELFLAED WHIMPERS)

17:41.687 --> 17:43.314
(AETHELFLAED CRIES OUT)

17:48.486 --> 17:52.198
- A good day.
- It was.

17:52.323 --> 17:55.993
- Though I'm glad it's over.
- Lord.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.080
If I may have a brief word.

18:00.706 --> 18:03.960
Lady, it will take just a moment.

18:04.085 --> 18:07.630
Be sure it does, Odda.
The king is tired.

18:17.390 --> 18:18.933
Lord.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.561
I fear that you undervalue Uhtred.

18:22.687 --> 18:24.814
He is by far
our most accomplished warrior

18:24.939 --> 18:26.357
and has been nothing but loyal--

18:26.482 --> 18:28.276
Odda, we have discussed this many times.

18:28.401 --> 18:30.987
He is sworn and yet he continues
to behave as if he were his own man.

18:31.112 --> 18:33.572
He is a little reckless at times, yes.

18:33.698 --> 18:36.826
Uhtred crosses into Daneland
without advising you or I first.

18:38.411 --> 18:41.789
I tolerate this behavior only because
he is our most accomplished warrior.

18:41.914 --> 18:44.292
But if he had not
crossed the street, lord,

18:44.417 --> 18:46.294
we would not know
of the fall of Lundene.

18:46.419 --> 18:50.381
Do not doubt for one moment
Uhtred Ragnarson has ambition.

18:52.425 --> 18:55.469
He will have been tempted
by this offer from the Northmen.

18:55.594 --> 18:59.223
- And yet, he is here, lord.
- Doing what?

19:00.016 --> 19:02.685
Spying? Waiting?

19:02.810 --> 19:05.271
Did he volunteer this information
before being confronted?

19:05.396 --> 19:08.482
- No, he did not.
- No, lord.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.818
Ask yourself why.

19:12.153 --> 19:15.197
I have said many times,

19:15.323 --> 19:17.658
he is a sword
I would rather wield than face,

19:17.783 --> 19:20.369
but he is not godly and never shall be.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.666
I wish you a good night's rest, Odda.
You are clearly in need of it.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.719
SIGEFRID: What troubles you, brother?

19:39.347 --> 19:42.224
ERIK: Uhtred, he doubts the dead man.

19:42.350 --> 19:44.935
- You believe so?
- Yes.

19:48.689 --> 19:52.401
We should have approached him
man on man, with honor.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.695
You think he knows it is a trick?

19:57.031 --> 19:58.240
Yes.

20:00.034 --> 20:02.286
- Maybe.
- You don't know.

20:02.411 --> 20:05.498
(CHUCKLES) No.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.584
(GROANS)

20:08.959 --> 20:10.086
(GROANS)

20:26.769 --> 20:32.316
- How is the pain?
- The same. Constant.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.323
It reminds me I am alive.

20:41.659 --> 20:43.536
That I should live.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.835
If Uhtred knows that Bjorn is a lie,

20:50.960 --> 20:52.962
then he will come.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.424
- With Alfred's army.
- Yes.

20:58.801 --> 21:02.638
- So I get to kill him after all.
- (LAUGHS)

21:04.014 --> 21:06.350
If we wish, there is a way to raise

21:06.475 --> 21:08.811
the greatest army
these shores have ever seen.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.730
It can be done.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.860
The Temes river would be
dark with ships.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.903
Danes and Northmen.

21:20.114 --> 21:24.869
All we need to be is clever...
and patient.

21:24.994 --> 21:27.830
- Patient?
- (LAUGHS)

21:32.418 --> 21:35.254
Oh, there will still be blood to spill,
brother.

21:37.548 --> 21:40.593
But this way, we can be kings of it all.

21:42.011 --> 21:43.804
No Guthrun.

21:43.929 --> 21:47.892
No Aethelred. No Alfred.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.729
No Uhtred.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.085
SIHTRIC: They say Lundene is dangerous.

22:15.211 --> 22:19.840
FINAN: Oh, it is, but Lundene is alive
with every kind of life.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.343
SIHTRIC: I hear women do not walk
the streets unguarded,

22:22.468 --> 22:24.386
that bodies are found
in the river daily.

22:24.512 --> 22:28.349
Twice daily. With each and every tide.

22:28.474 --> 22:30.768
Lundene is not Winchester,

22:30.893 --> 22:33.812
but one year here
is worth ten elsewhere.

22:34.313 --> 22:37.316
- Then why do you not live there?
- And end up dead in the river?

22:37.441 --> 22:39.902
- Do I look like a fool?
- (ALL LAUGH)

22:40.027 --> 22:42.363
What's to stop them
from cutting our throats

22:42.488 --> 22:43.989
and siding with the Northmen?

22:44.114 --> 22:47.326
I've been pondering the same.

22:47.451 --> 22:50.579
The answer is that you are
Alfred's son-in-law now.

23:07.346 --> 23:09.848
Uhtred, how is it that you know
these streets so well?

23:09.974 --> 23:11.684
I stayed here for a time

23:11.809 --> 23:14.019
with Earl Ragnar the Fearless
when I was a boy.

23:14.144 --> 23:15.604
When you were a Dane?

23:18.524 --> 23:20.568
As you can see,
the one fact in our favor

23:20.693 --> 23:23.862
is that the whole of Lundene
cannot be defended. It's too big.

23:23.988 --> 23:26.115
Even the walls surrounding
the old Roman city

23:26.240 --> 23:27.491
would need many hundreds of men.

23:27.616 --> 23:29.118
So the brothers' position is weak?

23:29.243 --> 23:34.331
Not weak, but Lundene's been open
to all tribes for a reason.

23:34.915 --> 23:37.960
The ground is not far now.
I shall speak.

23:38.085 --> 23:43.090
You should ask for food and ale, lord.
My belly believes my throat is cut.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.137
(SCREAMS)

23:54.226 --> 23:56.770
I do not understand
how this kills a man.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.606
Sigefrid, take his head
and be done with it.

23:58.731 --> 24:02.234
No, no. No, no, no. lwant to know how.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.320
PYRLIG: The cross kills
a man slowly, lord,

24:04.445 --> 24:06.113
over days.

24:06.238 --> 24:09.241
It is both torture and execution.

24:09.366 --> 24:12.703
Unlike Saxons and Danes,
the Romans were clever.

24:12.828 --> 24:16.248
There, you have your answer.
Now take his head off.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.541
PYRLIG: Agreed, lord.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.710
And if you please, when it comes to me,

24:19.835 --> 24:21.837
with your sharpest axe
and strongest man.

24:21.962 --> 24:26.800
- You talk too much.
- I do. You should kill me swiftly.

24:35.142 --> 24:37.144
God preserve us.

24:38.479 --> 24:41.607
It is a death, nothing more.

24:51.075 --> 24:54.745
Lords, it is Uhtred.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.549
Uhtred Ragnarson!

25:08.384 --> 25:10.803
The future king of Mercia!

25:10.928 --> 25:15.391
Welcome to Lundene,
your new home, should you want it.

25:16.558 --> 25:21.563
Sigefrid. I thought
you might want to kill me still.

25:21.689 --> 25:24.274
Oh, for a long time, I did.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.819
But then I grew to like my new hand.

25:26.944 --> 25:30.698
Though I have to be careful
when wiping my arse.

25:30.823 --> 25:33.409
(LAUGHS)

25:33.534 --> 25:36.870
It is good to see you here, Uhtred.

25:37.454 --> 25:39.415
Though your friends are not familiar.

25:39.540 --> 25:42.251
- This is Aethelred of Mercia.
- Lord.

25:43.335 --> 25:46.130
My spies tell me
you are to marry Alfred's daughter.

25:46.255 --> 25:49.466
Your spies are wrong, lord.
I've already married Alfred's daughter.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.845
- Oh, how does she ride?
- I've no complaint.

25:52.970 --> 25:55.222
Uhtred, why is he here?

25:55.347 --> 25:59.351
I am here, lords, to ask of you
your price for leaving Lundene.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.312
- Alfred wishes to negotiate.
- I wish to negotiate.

26:02.438 --> 26:06.525
We have only just arrived.
Why would we want to leave?

26:06.650 --> 26:09.903
You are warriors. You will know that
Lundene is impossible to defend,

26:10.028 --> 26:11.613
so let's get this done.

26:12.531 --> 26:15.534
- Is that a threat?
- Your price.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.119
It sounds like a threat.

26:17.244 --> 26:20.956
I'm asking you to retreat, lords,
for a price, for silver.

26:21.081 --> 26:24.585
Flesh is our price.

26:24.710 --> 26:28.756
- Your bride, Aethelflaed.
- Nonsense.

26:28.881 --> 26:31.008
She has great beauty,
a good mind.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.301
I'm in need of a wife.

26:32.426 --> 26:34.219
I'm in need of a hump.
We will share her.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.554
She is my wife.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.389
UHTRED: Aethelred, they are teasing you.

26:38.974 --> 26:43.437
Perhaps we can begin with a cup of ale?
It was a long walk from the river.

26:43.562 --> 26:46.106
A cup of ale it is, Lord Uhtred.

26:51.195 --> 26:55.115
- CLAPA: Do you have food, lord?
- ERIK: The bread is stale, but good.

27:08.003 --> 27:11.298
I have been told
that you saw the dead man rise.

27:12.508 --> 27:15.677
- I did.
- And you heard him speak?

27:15.803 --> 27:18.222
Of a good plan, yes.

27:18.347 --> 27:22.100
Could you guarantee Ragnar
and all the men he commands?

27:22.226 --> 27:24.645
- Are you with us?
- I'm here.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.397
ERIK: Yes, but are you here
for Alfred or yourself?

27:27.523 --> 27:31.485
- Or us?
- Ragnar's in the North.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.403
It would take some time
for news to reach him,

27:33.529 --> 27:38.200
more time for him to decide.
I guarantee nothing, lord.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.702
UHTRED:
Your prisoners are from where?

27:40.828 --> 27:42.704
ERIK: They are from Guthrum's arse.

27:42.830 --> 27:45.165
ALDHELM: The Earl Guthrum
is called Aethelstan now.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.626
SIGEFRID: Guthrum is a shit stain.

27:47.751 --> 27:51.129
He sends priests to Beamfleot
begging for peace.

27:51.255 --> 27:54.341
Begging for warriors to settle
and do what?

27:54.466 --> 27:56.969
- Raise sheep?
- Many men do, lord.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.763
There are no sheep farmers in Valhalla.

27:59.888 --> 28:02.474
UHTRED: Do you intend
to put all priests on the cross?

28:02.599 --> 28:04.560
It is Sigefrid's game.

28:04.685 --> 28:06.770
I do not understand how it kills a man.

28:06.895 --> 28:09.022
Slowly, lord. It's a cruel death.

28:09.147 --> 28:11.900
- That's what the priest there said.
- The priest is right.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.737
The priest looks like
a pale bag of bones and dough.

28:15.863 --> 28:17.155
You should let him fight.

28:17.281 --> 28:22.077
The Romans used this square
forjust that purpose. Combat.

28:22.202 --> 28:24.037
He would die too easily.

28:24.162 --> 28:28.041
Give him something to fight for.
His freedom.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.801
Why?

28:37.926 --> 28:43.056
I'd rather watch him spill his guts
than nailed to a piece of wood.

28:43.181 --> 28:45.017
Where's the fun in that?

28:58.280 --> 29:01.742
(CHUCKLES)

29:01.867 --> 29:04.828
Boltan! We need to be entertained!

29:05.996 --> 29:07.831
Are you man enough to kill a priest?

29:07.998 --> 29:10.375
(MEN CHEER)

29:12.753 --> 29:14.630
(MEN CHEER MORE LOUDLY)

29:20.052 --> 29:23.305
I'm almost ready.
Pointy end forward, is it?

29:24.640 --> 29:27.059
So, when I kill him,
I'm allowed to go free,

29:27.184 --> 29:28.185
that is the bargain?

29:28.310 --> 29:29.519
That is the bargain.

29:29.645 --> 29:32.689
Hear that, Boltan? He plans to kill you.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.775
- (LAUGHTER)
- I do. Beware.

29:34.900 --> 29:39.154
I'm afraid, lord.
Spare me this trial, I beg you.

29:39.363 --> 29:41.156
(ROARS)

29:41.281 --> 29:42.908
(MEN CHEER)

29:53.752 --> 29:56.421
(CHEERING AND LAUGHTER)

30:10.894 --> 30:12.646
Come on, priest.

30:16.733 --> 30:19.277
(MEN CHANT)

30:20.028 --> 30:21.571
Finish him!

30:31.331 --> 30:32.541
(SCREAMS)

30:35.669 --> 30:36.670
(MEN CHEER)

30:39.297 --> 30:43.927
Now I do not wish to kill this idiot
as I'm sure his mother loves him.

30:46.930 --> 30:50.809
But do I have your word as warriors
that I am now a free man?

30:50.934 --> 30:53.395
You have my word, priest.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.608
If all your men fight like this,

30:58.734 --> 31:01.903
Alfred will have no trouble
throwing you out of Lundene.

31:02.029 --> 31:05.115
- Put down your sword.
- Thank you, lord.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.950
It was a bit on the heavy side.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.209
(WOMEN SCREAM)

31:17.294 --> 31:20.589
Where have you learned to fight, priest?
The monastery?

31:20.714 --> 31:22.549
I'm a Briton, lord.

31:22.674 --> 31:27.429
- I was brought up killing Saxons.
- Then join us.

31:27.554 --> 31:32.601
- Join me.
- Ten years ago, maybe.

31:32.726 --> 31:37.564
But now I will fight for my God
and my freedom, it seems.

31:39.107 --> 31:43.153
If it is acceptable,
I will return with the Lord Uhtred.

31:43.278 --> 31:47.574
Not before we've settled
on a price. I hope?

31:49.034 --> 31:52.537
How much? For you to leave Lundene?

31:54.539 --> 31:57.626
ALFRED: I find it disturbing
that they will not consider silver.

31:57.751 --> 31:58.919
UHTRED: Why should they?

31:59.044 --> 32:02.380
The longer Wessex is without trade,
the greater the worth of Lundene.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.174
You were able to assess their strength?

32:04.299 --> 32:07.302
Your priest Pyrlig says
they have up to 1,000 men, lord.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.638
We can muster
three times that number, lord, easily.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.474
Lundene is not a field. It won't be
a simple question of numbers.

32:12.599 --> 32:15.644
Of course it is a question of numbers.
It will be a siege.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.938
The more men we have,
the greater the chance of success.

32:18.063 --> 32:20.649
- Regardless of how many die?
- It'll be men climbing ladders.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.692
It will only succeed
with numbers and with death.

32:22.818 --> 32:25.779
UHTRED: I will not lose men
for the sake of too little thought.

32:25.904 --> 32:30.992
- There must be a clear plan.
- Then let us hear this clear plan.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.665
We attack one gate
with a substantial army,

32:36.790 --> 32:39.709
allowing smaller groups to enter through
a second gate, a third gate even.

32:39.835 --> 32:42.087
- Attacking from land?
- Yes, from land.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.839
- ALFRED: Not the river?
- No, lord.

32:43.964 --> 32:47.050
The river is worth considering, lord.
It would be counter to their thinking.

32:47.175 --> 32:51.388
- There is a gate close to the river?
- Yes, lord. It is called Ludd Gate.

32:51.513 --> 32:54.891
Perfect. Silent oars,
the cover of darkness,

32:55.016 --> 32:56.393
the advantage of surprise.

32:56.518 --> 33:00.647
The river runs fast at Ludd Gate,
making it impossible to land men safely.

33:00.772 --> 33:04.442
But if the lord of Mercia believes that
men sinking to the bottom of the river

33:04.568 --> 33:07.028
is an advantage, then let him attack.

33:07.154 --> 33:11.491
Uhtred, your advice may well be sound,
but how am I to trust it?

33:12.993 --> 33:13.952
Lord?

33:14.077 --> 33:17.164
Why do the brothers call you
the next lord of Mercia?

33:22.419 --> 33:25.088
They call me the next king of Mercia,
Lord.

33:25.213 --> 33:27.048
Why?

33:33.972 --> 33:37.601
Why do they call you king?
What has been said, Uhtred?

33:37.726 --> 33:39.936
- What has been agreed?
- Nothing has been agreed.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.898
- How am I to trust you?
- Lord, I am weary of this.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.608
You are weary of this?

33:45.567 --> 33:48.403
You say you are sworn,
yet you behave like a spy.

33:48.528 --> 33:53.575
You float into Daneland and back again,
you tell half-truths, keep secrets

33:53.700 --> 33:56.536
and you refuse to accept
the existence of the one true God!

33:56.661 --> 33:59.998
- You serve your king reluctantly!
- But I serve, lord.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.249
I do not know you!

34:04.294 --> 34:06.421
And I can never know you, I...

34:14.094 --> 34:15.764
I do not understand you.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.809
And I will never understand you,
that is a fact,

34:19.935 --> 34:21.853
and one of increasing concern.

34:23.438 --> 34:28.109
And on top of this,
my enemies now call you king.

34:30.570 --> 34:33.072
And they called you a weasel, lord.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.993
Neither is true.

34:40.705 --> 34:42.623
Impossible.

35:02.644 --> 35:05.563
We must devise a plan of attack.
Uhtred, you will leave us.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.698
- You will leave.
- Oh, I will be happy to.

35:16.157 --> 35:19.536
Should you need me further,
you will find me at the Two Cranes Inn.

35:39.139 --> 35:42.309
Lord, with the greatest respect,

35:42.434 --> 35:46.855
the insolence we have witnessed
cannot go unpunished.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.482
With the greatest respect,
it is not your business.

35:49.607 --> 35:50.900
It is the business of Wessex.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.569
Uhtred is to return to Coccham.

35:52.694 --> 35:55.989
We are on the cusp of war,
you will need your best warriors.

35:56.114 --> 35:59.117
Uhtred is to return to Coccham.

36:00.452 --> 36:05.457
Then I will go to the Two Cranes Inn
and infonn him, personally.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.169
As you wish.

36:13.423 --> 36:15.550
You will return to Mercia
and gather men, a thousand.

36:15.675 --> 36:17.344
- Wessex will match it.
- Yes, lord.

36:17.469 --> 36:19.429
My exact written instruction
shall follow.

36:19.554 --> 36:22.849
I want Sigefrid and Erik
out of Lundene and soon.

36:22.974 --> 36:25.852
It will be done, lord. Thank you, lord.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.988
- Steapa.
- Lord?

36:37.822 --> 36:40.241
Do you trust the ealdorman Uhtred?

36:42.327 --> 36:44.329
With my life, lord.

37:28.581 --> 37:31.418
He believes I drink too much.

37:34.087 --> 37:36.673
And I do, of late.

37:36.798 --> 37:39.175
It's the taste, lord.

37:40.093 --> 37:42.095
It is the effect.

37:47.225 --> 37:49.978
I'm getting old, Uhtred.

37:53.106 --> 37:56.443
I'm getting old
with no son to follow me.

37:59.946 --> 38:02.407
It is as though my time has been wasted.

38:03.408 --> 38:06.327
No, lord. Never.

38:06.453 --> 38:12.959
Promise me you won't desert him,
not yet at least.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.044
I am not an oath-breaker.

38:18.131 --> 38:20.884
How can I serve a man
who doesn't trust me?

38:23.094 --> 38:25.513
To whom I have given so much.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.226
All he can see is how I am different.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.771
And all I see in him is his piety.

38:39.027 --> 38:41.196
He's a man I'm beginning to despise.

38:45.325 --> 38:50.663
I asked, and all that came
was further doubt.

38:53.750 --> 38:54.876
I am growing Wessex.

38:55.001 --> 38:59.380
I am reaching out for an England,
all in the name of God.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.718
Yet I am relying
upon the strength of a heathen.

39:05.136 --> 39:09.349
- The iron of a pagan.
- It does not fit, lord.

39:09.474 --> 39:11.059
ALFRED: It does not.

39:13.603 --> 39:17.315
What if all this time, it has been
the work of the Devil tempting me?

39:18.566 --> 39:22.612
Offering me this warrior,
this seemingly loyal and brave man

39:22.737 --> 39:27.200
who... piece by small piece,
is eating at my soul

39:27.325 --> 39:29.911
and clouding what I believe
to be right and wrong?

39:34.165 --> 39:39.212
Lord King,
this is what the Devil would do.

39:40.213 --> 39:43.716
But I swear,
your soul has not diminished.

39:44.926 --> 39:46.678
I would have seen it.

39:49.222 --> 39:54.352
Uhtred will not change, I'm sure.
He will be heathen till his death.

39:55.895 --> 39:58.815
But nor will you change.

39:58.940 --> 40:02.777
Your faith is one
that will grow stronger.

40:06.239 --> 40:11.244
You are God's king, lord.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.667
Yet at my right hand is a pagan.

40:18.918 --> 40:22.005
Do you trust him wholly?

40:23.673 --> 40:25.341
I do not.

40:29.554 --> 40:31.306
Icannot

40:34.809 --> 40:36.811
Then be rid of him.

41:02.003 --> 41:03.504
Lord.

41:20.980 --> 41:26.986
In my hand, I have a letter
from Alfred of Wessex!

41:27.111 --> 41:32.158
It is the promise of 1,000 men!

41:32.283 --> 41:34.744
(MEN CHEER)

41:34.869 --> 41:38.706
It is the 1,000 men demanded

41:38.831 --> 41:41.751
by our lord, Aethelred of Mercia,

41:41.876 --> 41:45.004
to fight alongside
the great fryd of Mercia,

41:45.129 --> 41:49.467
to help rid Lundene
of the filthy, stinking,

41:49.592 --> 41:53.346
pox-ridden, pig's-arse-ugly,

41:53.471 --> 41:56.140
heathen Danish bastards!

41:56.265 --> 41:57.475
(MEN CHEER)

41:57.600 --> 41:59.936
A toast!

42:00.061 --> 42:04.524
A toast. To the warriors of Mercia.

42:05.566 --> 42:09.987
Where we go,
Alfred and Wessex shall follow.

42:10.113 --> 42:13.116
And we shall rise.

42:13.241 --> 42:16.786
- We shall rise!
- (MEN CHEER)

42:16.911 --> 42:21.082
- To Mercia!
- (MEN CHEER)

42:21.207 --> 42:23.584
To Mercia!

42:46.441 --> 42:48.735
You are eating like a little bird.

42:48.860 --> 42:52.655
- Peck, peck, peck.
- I have no appetite.

42:57.493 --> 43:01.539
Tomorrow we ride.
I would like you to travel with me.

43:01.664 --> 43:04.375
- To battle?
- Part of the way.

43:06.461 --> 43:11.299
- Or would you rather not?
- No. No, lord. I would like to go.

43:11.424 --> 43:15.428
Then eat, for strength.

43:23.436 --> 43:24.562
Out.

43:24.687 --> 43:27.148
All of you, out.

43:44.540 --> 43:46.375
You have the palest of skin.

43:55.843 --> 43:57.053
Unblemished.

44:01.307 --> 44:05.937
- My touch offends you?
- No, it was a surprise, lord.

44:06.062 --> 44:07.730
Nothing more than that.

44:12.610 --> 44:15.571
Lord, love should be gentle and kind.

44:15.696 --> 44:18.115
Gentle and kind, she says.

44:19.867 --> 44:21.994
How is it that you have a knowledge
of how love should be?

44:22.119 --> 44:24.622
- I... I do not.
- Am I not the first?

44:25.790 --> 44:27.083
You will not insult me.

44:27.208 --> 44:29.502
And you will not offer me lessons
in how to plough a field.

44:29.627 --> 44:32.630
- That is not what I was doing.
- Who is it that you've been with?

44:33.923 --> 44:35.466
How many have you been with?

44:35.591 --> 44:37.510
- Lord, please.
- Uhtred is one, is he not?

44:37.635 --> 44:39.554
You have no right
to speak to me in this way!

44:39.679 --> 44:41.514
Of course I have a right,
you are my wife!

44:41.639 --> 44:43.558
I am Aethelflaed of Wessex

44:43.683 --> 44:47.019
and you will not treat me
like I am a servant girl!

44:47.144 --> 44:49.063
Do not...

44:57.697 --> 45:03.828
Do not... Never raise
your shrill voice to me!

45:14.380 --> 45:18.384
You will see a priest
and we shall find the truth of this.

45:18.509 --> 45:20.678
This is not love,
that is the truth of it.

45:20.803 --> 45:22.847
You will see a priest!

46:21.447 --> 46:25.034
Father Beocca.
I would like to speak with you.

46:26.369 --> 46:27.703
About prayer.

46:38.464 --> 46:40.257
This must go no further.

46:41.717 --> 46:46.931
I fear that I am not the first...
with my wife.

46:47.765 --> 46:51.477
- The first, lord?
- To lie with her, to bed her.

46:52.353 --> 46:55.147
Oh, I see.

46:55.272 --> 46:58.526
- But she is the king's daughter.
- I need it proven.

47:01.237 --> 47:04.115
Have you asked her, lord, directly?

47:04.240 --> 47:08.577
I need to know the truth of it.
ls there a way to test her word?

47:08.703 --> 47:10.579
Lord, she is Aethelflaed.

47:10.705 --> 47:15.251
Do I go to another priest, Father?
A stranger to my wife?

47:15.376 --> 47:16.877
FINAN: Lord Aethelred!

47:17.003 --> 47:21.924
Welcome to Coccham,
the jewel of Wessex.

47:22.049 --> 47:23.592
Uhtred is expecting you.

47:24.385 --> 47:28.139
There is a way, lord,
from the holy books.

47:28.264 --> 47:29.348
Then do it.

47:31.851 --> 47:35.563
Uhtred is with the women, lord,
helping them prepare food.

47:35.688 --> 47:38.232
Such is the life of a banished warrior.

47:43.779 --> 47:46.991
I have not seen the inside
of a pagan hall.

47:47.116 --> 47:50.286
I am surprised at its... warmth.

47:50.411 --> 47:53.330
Were you expecting
to see heads on poles, lord?

47:53.456 --> 47:56.625
I was, lady. Excuse my ignorance.

47:56.751 --> 48:00.212
I will excuse you this one time.

48:01.380 --> 48:04.842
Will Lady Aethelflaed be joining us
after prayers, lord?

48:04.967 --> 48:09.055
If she has the will, yes.
She has not traveled well.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.682
Should she be traveling at all
to battle?

48:11.807 --> 48:14.185
ALDHELM: It was her wish
to accompany her husband.

48:14.310 --> 48:18.022
They are newly married after all.

48:18.147 --> 48:19.774
She will be kept out of harm's way.

48:21.817 --> 48:24.862
AETHELWOLD: Uhtred, has the king written
that when the siege of Lundene begins,

48:24.987 --> 48:26.238
I am to be first up the ladder?

48:26.363 --> 48:29.241
It is, after all,
something he would do.

48:29.366 --> 48:32.912
You accept that I am in charge
of all men?

48:34.538 --> 48:37.750
- It's the king's wish.
- It is.

48:37.875 --> 48:40.377
Oh, dear.

48:40.711 --> 48:42.463
AETHELRED: You are with us?

48:44.340 --> 48:46.383
Why would I not be?

48:46.509 --> 48:48.177
I am an ealdorman of Wessex.

48:48.302 --> 48:51.263
Alfred has decided
to give you this one last chance.

48:53.516 --> 48:55.351
Do you have a plan?

48:55.476 --> 48:57.436
AETHELRED:
Together we will travel downriver

48:57.561 --> 48:59.688
and meet with the armies
of Mercia and Wessex,

48:59.814 --> 49:01.524
make camp a short distance from Lundene.

49:01.649 --> 49:04.902
- Do you have a plan of attack?
- Yes.

49:05.027 --> 49:07.321
It is not too dissimilar from your plan.

49:07.446 --> 49:09.824
You will attack the north gate
with your own men.

49:09.949 --> 49:11.742
Once the assault is underway,

49:11.867 --> 49:14.495
I shall attack from the marshes
with the main anny.

49:14.620 --> 49:17.206
And how will you know
my assault is underway?

49:17.331 --> 49:20.918
- I will know.
- You will know?

49:21.919 --> 49:26.549
AETHELRED: Uhtred, do not doubt me,
I want this victory.

49:26.674 --> 49:30.469
Lundene belongs to Mercia
and I am lord of Mercia.

49:30.594 --> 49:35.057
I will go with every man at my disposal
to reclaim what is mine.

49:35.182 --> 49:38.352
- Good.
- STEAPA: lam with Uhtred.

49:39.854 --> 49:44.275
- No, Steapa, you are with me.
- I am with Uhtred.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.193
The king says.

49:50.364 --> 49:52.116
Very well.

49:53.284 --> 49:56.912
I am with Steapa, behind Steapa.

49:57.037 --> 49:59.248
Your bravery knows no beginning,
Aethelwold.

50:00.583 --> 50:05.671
A toast. To the Mercians
who died for Wessex at Ethandun.

50:05.796 --> 50:09.049
And to the men of Wessex
who will fight for Mercia at Lundene.

50:10.593 --> 50:14.388
- To allies.
- To allies.

50:36.202 --> 50:38.954
This is the word of the Lord.

50:41.999 --> 50:45.294
If a man fears that his wife
has been unfaithful...

50:45.419 --> 50:47.379
I have not.

50:48.505 --> 50:53.719
...he shall bring her before a priest
who shall prepare the bitter waters.

50:57.014 --> 51:02.519
A mixture of God's water
and God's earth shall be drunk.

51:08.275 --> 51:13.239
Know this, if thou hast gone
aside to another man,

51:13.364 --> 51:19.119
the Lord shall make thy thigh to rot
and thy belly to swell. Amen.

51:20.996 --> 51:22.831
Amen.

51:24.833 --> 51:31.757
Child, you will now drink...
the bitter waters.

51:52.903 --> 51:55.739
This will not be necessary.

51:55.864 --> 51:59.952
You are pure and may God strike me down
this very instant if you are not.

52:06.041 --> 52:08.085
THYRA: Does he beat you?

52:09.253 --> 52:12.339
If he does not, then he will.
I can see it.

52:18.053 --> 52:22.266
He is not, er, tender or loving.

52:22.391 --> 52:24.393
Father Beocca,
you must tell the king.

52:24.518 --> 52:26.520
No! You cannot.

52:26.645 --> 52:29.148
The king is the only man who can end it.

52:29.273 --> 52:32.359
God put an end to this ordeal
before it had begun.

52:34.445 --> 52:37.281
Not all in Mercia are friends of Wessex.

52:37.406 --> 52:40.784
Not all are happy
with the king's influence.

52:40.909 --> 52:43.829
And I must do my duty to Alfred.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.250
My husband will not break me.

52:52.504 --> 52:56.342
You must not tell anyone
what has happened here.

53:00.971 --> 53:07.019
- You're quiet today, Father Beocca.
- A sleepless night.

53:07.144 --> 53:09.855
Should I speak with Thyra?
Tell her you need your rest?

53:09.980 --> 53:13.567
You shall do no such thing.
You will not talk of such matters.

53:13.692 --> 53:16.362
And what matters are those, Father?

53:17.613 --> 53:20.532
I have said enough.
You've all said enough.

53:54.733 --> 53:58.654
HAESTEN: Lords, they have set up
their camp no more than a mile away.

53:59.988 --> 54:01.532
Then we get this done.

54:01.657 --> 54:05.536
Tofi, the fire must smoke, black smoke.

54:05.661 --> 54:07.663
Yes, lord. There will be smoke.

54:13.460 --> 54:17.589
Every man on his feet!

54:17.714 --> 54:23.303
We must be ready!
You all know what needs to be done!

54:23.429 --> 54:25.431
We cannot fail!

54:26.473 --> 54:29.226
Go! We cannot fail!

54:29.351 --> 54:31.603
(SOLDIERS SHOUT)

55:02.468 --> 55:04.970
- It's open.
- Do you see a guard?

55:05.095 --> 55:07.681
None. I see a trap.

55:12.227 --> 55:14.646
Yes, of course if it is a trap,
we should walk towards it.

55:14.771 --> 55:16.023
Hey, shush your mouth.

55:37.294 --> 55:41.590
Hey, inside!
If you want to live, stay inside!

56:00.150 --> 56:05.280
- Any idea what's happening?
- None.

56:08.242 --> 56:10.244
MAN: Shield wall!

56:24.883 --> 56:26.510
Aethelred?

56:27.928 --> 56:29.721
Aethelred?

56:29.846 --> 56:31.098
AETHELRED: Uhtred?

56:32.891 --> 56:35.477
- We've seen not a single man.
- Same!

56:37.396 --> 56:39.439
Then they have fled.

56:39.565 --> 56:43.527
It is our numbers, lord.
They fear our numbers.

56:43.652 --> 56:45.821
Move. Move.

56:46.655 --> 56:47.948
They fear us!

56:48.073 --> 56:51.827
- The city is ours!
- (MEN CHEER)

56:51.952 --> 56:55.038
No, no, no! Keep the formation!

56:57.874 --> 57:00.002
Keep your formation!

57:03.589 --> 57:04.715
Lord.

57:07.634 --> 57:09.761
MAN: Fire! Fire!

57:09.886 --> 57:12.931
Fire! Up there!

57:13.056 --> 57:16.101
Stand ready! It's a signal!

57:16.226 --> 57:19.605
It is a signal no doubt, lord.
They will come.

57:28.905 --> 57:32.326
It's a signal that can be seen
from a mile or more.

57:33.785 --> 57:36.997
Aethelred! Aethelred!

57:38.707 --> 57:41.126
(GRUNTS)

57:42.669 --> 57:44.338
Move! Move!

57:46.173 --> 57:48.008
Aethelred! The camp!

57:50.302 --> 57:51.470
Thyra.

58:01.772 --> 58:03.649
Death.

58:03.774 --> 58:06.485
Death is coming.

58:06.610 --> 58:09.613
- Death is coming.
- (DISTANT RUMBLE OF HOOVES)

58:09.738 --> 58:12.532
- Death is coming!
- (DISTANT SHOUTING)

58:14.951 --> 58:17.245

58:20.415 --> 58:23.919

58:28.215 --> 58:30.926
Wake up!

58:31.051 --> 58:33.929
Take up your swords!

58:35.138 --> 58:37.432
Wake up!

58:37.557 --> 58:40.560
- Death is coming!
- Aethelflaed is to be protected!

58:40.686 --> 58:42.396
With your lives!

58:42.521 --> 58:46.108
For God and the king!

58:47.359 --> 58:49.403
(SOUND BECOMES MUFFLED)

58:59.454 --> 59:00.997
(SCREAMS)

59:01.123 --> 59:02.916

59:10.006 --> 59:13.218
Aethelflaed! Aethelflaed!

59:13.343 --> 59:15.679

59:43.165 --> 59:44.791
Run!

59:50.464 --> 59:55.177

Run! Run!
