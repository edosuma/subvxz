WHAT WAS NEED TO WIN HOH AND
TAKE THE FIRST SHOT

06:00.628 --> 06:03.697

LONG TIME, NOT LIKE NOBODY AND
THAT'S DOPE.

07:04.492 --> 07:08.128
EVERY TIME I TALK TO THEM, IT'S
WEIRD, THEY'RE ALWAYS ALONE.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.563
THEY'RE ALWAYS ALONE.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.064
AND THEY TALK AMONGST EACH
OTHER.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.367
WHEN I COME IN, THEY SAY YES TO
ANYTHING I SAY

07:14.401 --> 07:18.271
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO, THEY WANT
TO -- I'M HOPING LIKE ONE OF

07:18.305 --> 07:20.340
THEM WILL HAVE A GOOD SHOT.

07:20.373 --> 07:23.443
IT GETS WEIRD WHEN HE LIES.

07:23.477 --> 07:28.916

GET HER FAR IN THE GAME.

07:28.949 --> 07:34.822

SECRET ALLIANCE WITH ALEX, I'D

08:08.522 --> 08:11.592
LOVE TO TAKE ALEX AS FAR AS I

08:11.625 --> 08:13.627
PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE
STRONGEST COMPETITORS IN THE

08:13.661 --> 08:17.865

BE I FEEL LIKE COULD GET STUCK

08:17.898 --> 08:19.099

>> OK.

09:35.075 --> 09:42.015
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

09:42.049 --> 09:42.683
OK.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.620
>> DO YOU WANT TO DO THE SAME?

09:46.654 --> 09:54.695
>> DO YOU WANT TO KEEP ME AND
JOSH AROUND?

09:54.728 --> 10:02.202

ORDER, WE'RE NOT A EVEN ON THE

10:06.874 --> 10:08.075
PECKING ORDER.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.744
YOU AND JOSH NEED TO LAY LOW.

10:10.778 --> 10:15.482
YOU NEED TO BE KIND OF WHAT I
BELIEVE THEIR MINDS ARE US TWO

10:15.515 --> 10:25.693
CAN BEAT THEM BUT LITTLE DO THEY
KNOW AND THEN --

10:25.726 --> 10:27.394

OPTIONS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO

11:43.904 --> 11:47.374
I'M GOING TO HAVE A FEW
CONVERSATIONS AND I'M GOING TO

11:47.407 --> 11:49.509

12:23.343 --> 12:26.446
WHY WOULD THEY WORK WITH YOU?

12:26.479 --> 12:27.680
?

12:27.714 --> 12:32.552
>> THE STARS ARE I LINING TO
HAVE FOUR STARS TO VOTE BUT I'M

12:32.585 --> 12:36.289
NOT GOING TO GIVE UP UNTIL JULIE
READS THAT VOTE.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.324
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.193
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.294
?

12:41.328 --> 12:47.167
I WERE TO TALK JASON INTO
KEEPING ME, DO YOU THINK HE

12:47.200 --> 12:47.667
WOULD?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.569
IF THEY WOULD AGREE?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.806
IF THEY AGREE, WHATEVER THEY DO
I DO, I NEVER WANTED TO GET RID

12:52.840 --> 12:53.974
OF YOU.

12:54.007 --> 12:58.045
THERE'S ONE PERSON YOU KNOW THAT
ANNOYS ME TO THE END, TWO

12:58.078 --> 12:59.847
PEOPLE.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.415
MATT AND RAVEN?
>> REALLY.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.783
I CAN'T EVEN STAY OPEN.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.418
I DON'T TALK TO MATT AT ALL.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.686
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

13:06.719 --> 13:11.158
ALL HE DOES A PLAY AROUND ON THE
GRILL ALL DAY LONG.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.292
ANNOYING THEN.

13:12.325 --> 13:20.100
TRYING TO ATTACK TO ALEX
>> WHATEVER YOU DO GOT TO GET

13:20.133 --> 13:21.334
HER.

13:21.368 --> 13:29.176
>> I WANTED TO ASK YOU, LIKE WHY
DO YOU WANT TO PUT ME OUT OF

13:29.209 --> 13:31.144
THIS HOUSE
>> IT WOULD BE FASCINATING TO

13:31.178 --> 13:34.447
KEEP YOU
>> WHAT IF IT WAS JUST YOU,

13:34.481 --> 13:40.353
JASON, KEVIN AND PAUL?
>> THIS IS SAME ARGUMENT THAT

13:40.387 --> 13:43.256
CODY PUT ME IN.

13:43.290 --> 13:48.495
>> SO YOU YOU THINK IF MATT AND
WIN, THEY'RE GOING TO GO AFTER

13:48.528 --> 13:53.233
CHRISTMAS AND JOSH?

13:53.266 --> 13:57.637
THEY'RE GOING TO GO AFTER YOU
AND JASON BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW

13:57.670 --> 13:58.872
STRONG YOU ARE.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.175
>> THERE WILL BE FIVE PEOPLE IF
ALL ARE ON BOARD VERSUS THREE.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.879
IF YOU WANT TO TALK MATT OUT, I
WOULD STILL BE THE BIGGER

14:05.913 --> 14:09.716
TARGET, IF CHRISTMAS AND JOSH
WERE TO WIN, THEY STILL WANT ME

14:09.749 --> 14:18.425

14:18.458 --> 14:23.530
>> ANY CONVERSATION WE COULD
HAVE WHAT DO YOU THINK

14:23.563 --> 14:28.435

ANYTHING.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.236
ONE VOTE.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.204
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD DO
ANYTHING

14:31.238 --> 14:36.776
>> WHAT IT IF WERE JASON AND
ALEX?

14:36.809 --> 14:48.721
>> I DON'T THINK THE JURY WOULD
VOTE TO.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.258
>> I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH
INFLUENCE IN THE HOUSE WHERE I

14:51.291 --> 14:55.095
CAN MAKE ANYTHING I WANT HAPPEN,
DO WE STICK WITH THE PLAN AND

14:55.128 --> 15:01.268

THINGS UP AND GET MATT OUT NOW?

>> HUNDRED %.

33:35.314 --> 33:38.016
>> Julie: DEPENDING ON WHERE
THE POWER WAS YOU FLOATED ON

33:38.050 --> 33:39.151
OVER THERE.

>> I CAME IN THE GAME AND I
WANTED TO POWER LINES AND I

33:47.526 --> 33:50.262
I HAD IT

33:50.296 --> 33:53.599
STRATEGY GOING IN

AND THEN IT WAS MORE WITH MORE
OF THE GIRL BUT ELENA WAS JUST

33:56.835 --> 34:02.341
REALLY, CAUGHT MY EYE, AND WE
>>, THEN CODY JUST COMPLETELY IF

34:02.374 --> 34:06.178
YOU COULD HAVE PUT ANYBODY ELSE
IN THIS GAME, I WOULD HAVE BEEN

34:06.212 --> 34:09.881
IN THE HOUSE, HE LEFT AND RIGHT
RIPPED APART MY GAME

34:09.915 --> 34:13.319
>> Julie: DO YOU BELIEVE, THE
FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T PICK A

34:13.352 --> 34:17.989
SIDE AND STICK TO A SIDE IS WHAT
COST YOU YOUR GAME

34:18.023 --> 34:23.262
>> MOST LIKELY BUT I'M NOT -- I
WANTED TO WORK WITH CODY SO BAD

34:23.295 --> 34:26.098
AND I WANTED THE POWER AND I
LOVE THOSE GUY, I DIDN'T LIKE

34:26.132 --> 34:32.471
THE OTHER SIDE OF HOUSE, JUST
FLOATERS WHO CAME TOGETHER AND

JUMPED IN AND STARTED KICKING ON
THEM

34:36.608 --> 34:40.579

34:49.188 --> 34:50.689
AND CODY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.625
>> Julie: WHO DO YOU THINK WAS
THE BIGGEST THREAT TO YOUR GAME

34:53.659 --> 34:57.729
>> CHRISTMAS, ME AND HAD HE GOT
ALONG GREAT.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.599
DOMINIQUE WAS THE DOWNFALL,
DOMINIQUE KEPT ME LEVEL HEADED

35:00.632 --> 35:05.404
IN THE GAME AND THEN WHEN SHE
LEFT, EVERYTHING JUST CRUMBLED

35:05.437 --> 35:07.606
ELENA TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM ME.

35:07.639 --> 35:12.311
DIDN'T WORK TOO WELL AND CODY
CAME BACK AND THAT WAS JUST

35:12.344 --> 35:16.848
HONESTLY THE DOWNFALL, BECAUSE I
WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CODY AND

35:16.882 --> 35:17.849
DOMINIQUE.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.885
I TRULY DON'T KNOW
>> Julie: LET'S TALK ABOUT

35:19.918 --> 35:20.419

35:23.389 --> 35:30.396
>> I'M A BIG TEDDY BEAR
>> Julie: WOMEN LIKE THAT.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.964
DO YOU BELIEVE, YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH ELENA IN THE

35:32.998 --> 35:36.835
GAME ENDED UP BEING MONTH
IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN ACTUALLY

35:36.868 --> 35:42.674
PLAYING BIG BROTHER

WHEN JOSH WAS PUT UP -- I WAS
CONVINCED EVERYBODY WANTED JOSH

35:47.979 --> 35:54.953
OUT EXCEPT FOR CHRISTMAS WITH
THE SYSTEM THREE VOTE.

35:54.986 --> 35:59.658
IT'S HARDER THAN IT LOOKS, I WAS
GOOD WITH PAUL, WITH JASON, WITH

35:59.691 --> 36:03.128
CODY AND JESS, THEN IT WAS JUST
>> Julie: WHAT ABOUT JOSH?

36:03.161 --> 36:07.733
WE'VE SEEN UPS AND DOWNS
>> TRUTHFULLY WITH JOSH, HE IS A

36:07.766 --> 36:09.335
GREAT GUY.

36:09.368 --> 36:15.474

HIS MOUTH THAT MUCH, HE DIDN'T

36:15.507 --> 36:16.742
BACK DOWN.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.679
HE'S THE ONE THAT TURNED ON ME
FIRST, BUT I DID THROW A DRINK

36:20.712 --> 36:21.647
IN HIS FACE.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.616
I CAME IN TO PLAY GAME.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.751
PLAYED A POOR GAME.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.254
BUT WITH THE PEOPLE IT WAS
NOTHING PERSONAL.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.321
JOSH IS GREAT.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.188
HE'S GREAT GUY.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.290
