00:01.167 --> 00:06.638
(narrator)
Previously on "The Making
of the Mob: New York"...

00:06.640 --> 00:09.775
Charles "Lucky" Luciano
has transformed himself

00:09.777 --> 00:11.577
from a low-level thug

00:11.579 --> 00:17.082
to become the most powerful
mob boss in the American Mafia.

00:17.084 --> 00:19.518
Deported to Italy by
the U.S. government,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.520
Luciano still finds a way

00:21.522 --> 00:24.423
to assert his power
in the United States.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.625
We're gonna be bringing a lot
more heroin into the country.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.428
(narrator)
And with the money pouring in,

00:29.430 --> 00:33.499
he invests heavily in
Bugsy Siegel's vision

00:33.501 --> 00:36.568
of Las Vegas.

00:36.570 --> 00:40.072
(Siegel)
I see people, hotels,

00:40.074 --> 00:42.174
casinos and money.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.443
Lots of money.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.112
(narrator)
But the plan backfires.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.614
(Luciano)
Meyer, this isn't good.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.483
There's a lot of money
unaccounted for.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.286
(narrator)
And Siegel pays
the ultimate price.

00:54.288 --> 00:57.523
(gunshots)

00:58.825 --> 01:01.360
With one of his
original crew dead,

01:01.362 --> 01:04.563
another threat emerges from
Luciano's inner circle.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.066
(Genovese)
You're holding
me down, Charlie.

01:07.068 --> 01:10.469
How's it feel to know you're
never going back to New York?

01:10.471 --> 01:12.137
(grunting)

01:12.139 --> 01:13.639
(narrator)
As disgraced mobster

01:13.641 --> 01:16.708
Vito Genovese fights
to regain power,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.710
breaking ties with Luciano

01:18.712 --> 01:21.413
and joining forces with
the rising underboss...

01:21.415 --> 01:22.648
So, what are you
waiting for?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.616
The right opportunity.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.154
(narrator)
...to take control of the Mafia.

01:32.225 --> 01:36.228
â™ª

01:36.230 --> 01:39.264
(man)
â™ª This ain't no time

01:39.266 --> 01:43.335
â™ª To feel sorry
for myself â™ª

01:43.337 --> 01:46.371
â™ª I can't help it

01:46.373 --> 01:50.209
â™ª 'Cause there's nobody else

01:50.211 --> 01:53.345
â™ª And I walk these streets

01:53.347 --> 01:57.149
â™ª With your name
on my tongue â™ª

01:57.151 --> 02:00.185
â™ª But I dare not speak

02:00.187 --> 02:04.756
â™ª Only there it belongs

02:04.758 --> 02:09.361
â™ª There's got to be
a better way â™ª

02:09.363 --> 02:11.163
â™ª Better way

02:11.165 --> 02:13.165
(gunshot echoes)

02:31.885 --> 02:34.720
(engine idling)

02:34.722 --> 02:38.657
(Mangano)
No! No! Don't do this!

02:38.659 --> 02:41.293
Don't do this!
Start walking.

02:42.762 --> 02:43.896
No!
Keep walking,

02:43.898 --> 02:46.298
Listen to me!

03:04.417 --> 03:06.485
(gunshot)

03:10.790 --> 03:13.292
(gunshots)

03:18.932 --> 03:21.466
(narrator)
In April of 1951,

03:21.468 --> 03:25.771
Vincent Mangano, the head of one
of the five New York families,

03:25.773 --> 03:27.806
is murdered.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.609
For the first time since the
Commission was formed

03:30.611 --> 03:34.313
20 years earlier by
Charles "Lucky" Luciano,

03:34.315 --> 03:38.951
a mob boss has been violently
removed from power.

03:38.953 --> 03:41.954
The hit on Mangano was
ordered by his underboss,

03:41.956 --> 03:43.655
Albert Anastasia,

03:43.657 --> 03:46.858
so he could take control
of the family.

03:46.860 --> 03:51.830
The Commission, this was
really to protect each family,

03:51.832 --> 03:55.567
so that they had a certain type
of respect and control.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.402
And for a while, it worked.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.271
(man)
Hey, get in here.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.441
(Sal Polisi)
But, I mean, everybody
wanted to move up.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.818
(narrator)
4,000 miles away,

04:12.820 --> 04:15.921
Lucky Luciano was
in exile in Italy,

04:15.923 --> 04:20.559
and is forced to watch his
criminal empire turn to chaos

04:20.561 --> 04:23.895
as gangsters begin
vying for power.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.932
With no hope of
returning to America,

04:26.934 --> 04:30.869
Luciano must rely on his
advisor, Meyer Lansky,

04:30.871 --> 04:35.440
and acting boss of the Luciano
crime family, Frank Costello,

04:35.442 --> 04:38.310
to keep his operation intact.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.546
I want what I said,
specifically what I said,

04:41.548 --> 04:43.749
on the official record.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.952
(narrator)
But after Costello's disastrous
testimony to the U.S. Senate,

04:46.954 --> 04:50.956
the other families start
to see him as weak.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.459
And Vito Genovese has
teamed up with Carlo Gambino

04:54.461 --> 04:56.561
to try to reclaim his position

04:56.563 --> 04:59.031
at the head of the
Luciano family.

04:59.033 --> 05:03.035
(Selwyn Raab)
Vito Genovese comes back to
America, he's very envious.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.770
There's a lot of evidence,
he felt that

05:04.772 --> 05:06.605
he had been shortchanged,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.740
and he isn't getting a fair
share from Costello,

05:08.742 --> 05:13.612
and he just figures
he deserves the job.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.915
(narrator)
With Genovese gunning
for his position,

05:16.917 --> 05:20.786
Frank Costello begins to
crack under the pressure.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.823
â™ª

05:49.982 --> 05:52.417
(heartbeat pounding)

05:59.659 --> 06:02.361
(car backfiring)

06:04.430 --> 06:07.099
(Sal Polisi)
The worst part of the mob
was always the threat

06:07.101 --> 06:10.769
of being killed
by your own kind.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.939
So, you have this weight that
you're carrying around with you.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.608
You can only put so much
weight on a table,

06:16.610 --> 06:18.677
and eventually,
it's gonna break.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.782
(Costello)
Can't talk to anybody.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.952
I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.020
Go on.

06:31.791 --> 06:34.926
I gotta wake up every morning
and look over my shoulder, Doc.

06:36.963 --> 06:39.164
Why do you have to look
over your shoulder?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.466
Doc, I'm gonna be walking
down the street one day,

06:41.468 --> 06:42.734
I'm gonna get a
bullet in my head.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.637
What am I
supposed to do?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.439
Tell me what to do.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.875
(Sal Polisi)
Going to a psychiatrist

06:49.877 --> 06:52.577
would have been perceived
as weakness.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.580
Who would believe a mobster
would go to a psychiatrist?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.116
It sounds like he's setting
himself up to be killed.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.054
(narrator)
But Costello isn't able to keep

07:03.056 --> 07:06.725
his visits a secret for long.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.598
It's been a rough
couple of months, Frank.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.900
I know that.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.835
We're busting our
asses out there.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.503
So am I, trust me.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.505
That's not how
we hear it.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.475
Look, Frank, nobody has
challenged your authority.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.611
But a shrink?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.014
You guys are blowing this whole
thing way out of proportion.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.116
I was just doing
what I need to do

07:31.118 --> 07:33.452
to lead this family.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.225
Listen, Frank, you do
what you gotta do.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.094
But remember,
we will, too.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.604
(phone ringing)

07:55.475 --> 07:56.575
Hello?

07:56.577 --> 08:00.078
I need muscle.
I need Moretti.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.048
What-- Frank,
but what's going on?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.517
<i>Moretti always</i>
<i>had Lucky's back,</i>

08:05.519 --> 08:08.053
<i>and he's never backed</i>
<i>down from anybody.</i>

08:08.055 --> 08:10.155
You gotta tell me
what's going on, Frank.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.090
I don't know.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.893
But I'm not gonna
sit around to find out.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.130
I'll make the call.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.006
(narrator)
To keep himself safe,

08:28.008 --> 08:32.744
Costello's enlisted the
protection of Willie Moretti,

08:32.746 --> 08:35.680
a ruthless mobster from
New Jersey with deep ties

08:35.682 --> 08:38.250
to Luciano and his
crime family.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.519
â™ª

08:47.593 --> 08:50.996
With an army of 60 thugs,

08:50.998 --> 08:55.066
Moretti and his crew protect
Costello around the clock...

08:59.772 --> 09:02.173
...guaranteeing that a hit
on the acting head

09:02.175 --> 09:06.711
of the Luciano family
will be next to impossible.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.723
Vito Genovese
and his new ally,

09:18.725 --> 09:22.027
Mangano family underboss,
Carlo Gambino,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.962
meet secretly to strategize.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.197
Salute.
<i>Salute.</i>

09:32.004 --> 09:34.039
(narrator)
To get to Costello,

09:34.041 --> 09:37.909
the gangsters will have to
eliminate his protection.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.245
Why does Moretti have an army
protecting Frank Costello

09:40.247 --> 09:42.747
all of a sudden?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.083
Me.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.087
You know, Carlo,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.723
if we wanna be
legitimate bosses,

09:51.725 --> 09:55.327
we gotta get the Commission
to give its okay.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.862
And Frank's on
the damn Commission.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.198
It's still the
Luciano family.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.701
So, what, Lucky's
gonna listen to me?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.902
No, he won't.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.137
But he might
listen to me.

10:10.209 --> 10:13.612
(narrator)
Gambino realizes to
order a hit on Moretti,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.380
he'll have to convince Luciano

10:15.382 --> 10:18.183
that the mob is better off
without him,

10:18.185 --> 10:21.853
and he thinks
he has an angle.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.290
For months, Moretti has been
exhibiting strange behavior

10:25.292 --> 10:29.260
and speaking too freely
about mob activity.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.197
Many believe his brain
may be deteriorating

10:32.199 --> 10:34.933
due to the effects
of advanced syphilis.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.335
(bell tolls)

10:52.685 --> 10:54.386
We gotta talk
about Moretti.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.821
So, talk.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.057
The man's not well.

10:59.059 --> 11:03.328
He's been shooting his mouth
off to the cops, politicians.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.130
He's lost his mind.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.899
If he's sick,
you take him to a doctor.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.301
It's too late for that.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.937
It'd be a
mercy killing.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.839
Killing?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.409
You don't kill Moretti.
He's a good friend of mine.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.945
A decent man.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.981
If he dies from the clap,
that's one thing.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.784
Someone's gotta make
a tough decision here.

11:25.786 --> 11:29.854
Between Moretti and Costello,
the hearings and the press,

11:29.856 --> 11:32.257
our business is
going to hell.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.426
And Frank's not doing
a damn thing about it.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.729
You got a problem
with Costello now?

11:37.731 --> 11:40.865
It's not just me.
It's everyone.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.468
It's the whole
damn Commission.

11:43.470 --> 11:47.105
Carlo, I am the Commission.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.173
Charlie, look--

11:48.175 --> 11:49.441
No.

11:49.443 --> 11:52.010
The answer's no.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.887
(narrator)
In 1951, Carlo Gambino
and Vito Genovese

12:02.889 --> 12:07.125
are determined to seize
power in the underworld.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.127
To move up in the mob,

12:09.129 --> 12:12.297
they know their next step
is taking out Willie Moretti,

12:12.299 --> 12:15.734
a hit that's been refused
by Lucky Luciano.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.203
Now, the gangsters must decide

12:18.205 --> 12:20.171
whether to make
a dangerous move,

12:20.173 --> 12:23.341
going directly against
Luciano's orders

12:23.343 --> 12:28.246
and eliminating the protector of
his acting boss, Frank Costello.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.756
â™ª

12:52.438 --> 12:54.072
(gunshots)

12:58.210 --> 13:00.345
(door closes)

13:00.347 --> 13:02.514
(woman screaming)

13:10.389 --> 13:12.957
(narrator)
After Gambino and Genovese

13:12.959 --> 13:16.294
defy Luciano and take out
Moretti,

13:16.296 --> 13:19.297
Luciano's advisor, Meyer Lansky,

13:19.299 --> 13:24.202
fears the future of the Luciano
crime family is at stake,

13:24.204 --> 13:27.071
and calls a meeting with
influential Commission member,

13:27.073 --> 13:29.541
Joe Bonanno.

13:29.543 --> 13:33.244
The Mangano hit blindsided us
as much as it did you.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.445
I had no idea.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.214
And what about
Willie Moretti?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.851
You knew he was
protecting Frank.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.221
You knew that Charlie
said no.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.223
You knew that
everyone knew.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.859
Moretti was losing
his mind to syphilis.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.227
You knew that.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.162
He was a risk
to all of us.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.333
So...

13:55.335 --> 13:57.569
you're taking sides
with Vito, then.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.438
Vito's just doing
whatever he needs to do.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.074
As for Frank,
now, a lot of guys

14:03.076 --> 14:05.977
think he's not capable
to lead anymore.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.950
Then, what about Charlie?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.451
Hmm?

14:13.453 --> 14:16.988
What about the man
who made you a boss?

14:16.990 --> 14:19.991
The man who let
you live?

14:19.993 --> 14:22.961
You forget about that?

14:22.963 --> 14:25.363
He vetoed the
Moretti hit himself.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.302
He's in Italy, Meyer.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.505
And he's never
coming back.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.485
(Rich Cohen)
One of the reasons why
Meyer Lansky was successful

14:47.487 --> 14:52.223
is because as counterintuitive
as it sounds,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.958
he was honest.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.060
He was an honest criminal.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.037
(phone ringing)

15:07.673 --> 15:09.374
Hello?

15:09.376 --> 15:13.144
Look, it's not good,
Charlie, it's not good.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.246
Bonanno is backing Vito.

15:17.516 --> 15:20.351
The rest of 'em are, too.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.654
<i>They think it's inevitable</i>
<i>and they don't wanna be the guy</i>

15:22.656 --> 15:24.956
<i>to stand in his way.</i>

15:27.426 --> 15:31.029
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I don't know what else to do.

15:31.031 --> 15:34.098
â™ª

15:53.052 --> 15:56.187
(narrator)
With Luciano's influence
waning in New York,

15:56.189 --> 16:00.358
Gambino believes the time has
come to take on Frank Costello.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.695
But first, he'll need
to convince Genovese

16:03.697 --> 16:06.698
that this is the moment
they've been waiting for.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.599
(Genovese)
What's going
on with Frank?

16:08.601 --> 16:12.971
The guy's losing his mind
over here, all right, Carlo?

16:12.973 --> 16:16.240
(Gambino)
We're gonna have to move
on this sooner or later.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.377
We're gonna deal with Costello.

16:19.379 --> 16:23.348
Frank's falling apart.
We got no choice.

16:36.762 --> 16:41.599
(narrator)
For Genovese, following
through with Gambino's plan

16:41.601 --> 16:45.670
means taking out a man
he's known for decades...

16:45.672 --> 16:48.239
Hey, Frank.
Vito.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.742
I want you to meet
my associate, Charlie Luciano.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.510
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.247
(narrator)
...and a member of
his original crew.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.686
On May 2nd, 1957,

17:01.688 --> 17:07.425
Genovese orders notorious hitman
Vinny "The Chin" Gigante

17:07.427 --> 17:10.595
to kill Frank Costello.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.664
â™ª

17:57.242 --> 17:58.309
(gun cocking)

17:58.311 --> 18:00.445
(gunshot)

18:23.168 --> 18:24.402
(gunshot)

18:29.575 --> 18:32.176
(narrator)
In May of 1957,

18:32.178 --> 18:36.581
Frank Costello was
shot in the head

18:36.583 --> 18:38.683
and left to die.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.892
Despite taking a
.38 caliber bullet

18:47.894 --> 18:50.761
at near point-blank range,

18:50.763 --> 18:54.265
Costello
miraculously survives.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.813
Hi, Frank.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.617
You come to finish
what you started?

19:16.288 --> 19:18.389
(door closes)

19:21.727 --> 19:23.194
(sighs)

19:24.463 --> 19:26.464
Doesn't have to
be this way.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.669
You could retire.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.237
No one's gonna
come after you.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.240
I'll make sure of it.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.742
I'm not gonna
run out on Charlie.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.945
You're no good
to him anymore.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.948
The Commission's
done with you.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.784
It's just the
way it happened.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.486
(sighs)

19:54.359 --> 19:56.827
Sorry about this--
Shut up, Vito.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.240
(narrator)
Although wounded and vulnerable,

20:09.242 --> 20:12.610
Frank Costello refuses
to back down.

20:14.513 --> 20:17.648
After recovering from
the assassination attempt,

20:17.650 --> 20:21.519
he reaches out to the one boss
of the New York crime families

20:21.521 --> 20:26.724
that he thinks will still be
loyal to him, Albert Anastasia.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.361
Vito won't quit till
I'm dead and he's boss.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.730
I need to know you
have my back.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.369
I got your back.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.605
As long as you
got mine.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.344
Anastasia doesn't like
the idea that Genovese

20:46.346 --> 20:48.679
tried to kill Costello.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.984
So, they have a
mutual agreement.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.986
(narrator)
While Costello and Anastasia

20:54.988 --> 20:59.390
form an alliance to protect
the Luciano crime family...

21:02.561 --> 21:06.497
Anastasia's ambitious underboss,
Carlo Gambino,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.900
and Vito Genovese
step up their own plan.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.703
He's gotta be
scared to death.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.939
I mean, the guy's heart
wasn't in it before.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.440
What about Charlie?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.276
Oh, screw Charlie.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.745
No one gives a rat's ass
what he has to say anymore.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.713
He's got some
loyal men.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.582
He's got Anastasia.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.885
Charlie gives Albert
the green light.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.620
(sighs)

21:33.325 --> 21:36.794
The old generation
believed in loyalty

21:36.796 --> 21:38.329
and not turning on
their friends.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.398
And the new generation
that came in,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.968
um... they'd do
a hit in a minute.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.779
Yeah, that's beautiful.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.348
Good.
Can I get your cap for you?

21:57.350 --> 21:58.716
There you go,
thank you.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.618
(clears throat)

22:01.720 --> 22:02.953
All right.

22:02.955 --> 22:03.988
(groans)

22:03.990 --> 22:05.489
How's the family?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.992
Good, good.
They're not annoying me

22:07.994 --> 22:09.894
too much, which is
always good.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.563
I understand.
Married myself.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.084
All right.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.986
Just relax and
let me do my job.

22:52.771 --> 22:54.872
Excuse me, sir, I need to go
in the back for a moment.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.475
All right.
Don't be too long.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.078
â™ª

23:05.117 --> 23:07.585
(gunshots)

23:13.625 --> 23:17.027
(chair squeaking)

23:41.653 --> 23:44.422
(phone ringing)

23:59.037 --> 24:01.071
All right.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.878
We're not gonna have to worry
about Anastasia anymore.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.915
(narrator)
In partnership
with Vito Genovese,

24:10.917 --> 24:13.184
Carlo Gambino has
successfully eliminated

24:13.186 --> 24:16.587
the head of his family,
Albert Anastasia.

24:18.490 --> 24:22.059
It's one of the most brazen
murders in Mafia history.

24:22.061 --> 24:25.229
A boss of one of the
five New York families

24:25.231 --> 24:28.732
has been gunned down
in broad daylight.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.202
Albert Anastasia goes to
get a shave and a haircut,

24:31.204 --> 24:33.904
and he gets killed
in a barber chair.

24:33.906 --> 24:37.541
And it's very much
out in public.

24:37.543 --> 24:41.645
It's not a mob hit where
they've taken you in the woods.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.815
It's happened right there in
the middle of New York city.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.750
That's one of the reasons
it's iconic.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.553
It's so visible.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.923
(narrator)
Gambino's bold plan
has paid off.

24:52.925 --> 24:57.928
By taking out Anastasia, he's
gone from mid-level gangster

24:57.930 --> 25:00.731
to the head of his own
crime family.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.566
Congratulations.

25:03.902 --> 25:07.271
(narrator)
And the Gambino family is born.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.574
(Selwyn Raab)
Carlo Gambino is a prime mover.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.243
Genovese and Gambino were close.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.246
They decide they have
to hit Anastasia.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.248
It clears the way
for both of 'em.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.991
(narrator)
After an attempt on his life

25:26.993 --> 25:30.261
and the murder of his only
ally on the Commission,

25:30.263 --> 25:33.764
Frank Costello
does the unthinkable.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.267
With Lucky Luciano's approval,

25:36.269 --> 25:41.105
Costello ends his 20-year reign
as the head of the family.

25:41.107 --> 25:44.575
(Rudy Giuliani)
Frank goes and visits
the Commission,

25:44.577 --> 25:49.880
and says, "Look,
I wanna retire.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.650
I will have nothing to do
with this ever again."

25:52.652 --> 25:58.789
Frank Costello retired from
the Mafia as an elder statesman.

25:58.791 --> 26:02.159
Only one that I can think of,
at least in those days,

26:02.161 --> 26:06.564
that was ever
allowed to retire.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.867
And the reason they trusted him
was, he didn't give up the guy

26:09.869 --> 26:13.003
who tried to--
tried to knock him off.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.073
â™ª

26:31.590 --> 26:35.359
(narrator)
Two decades after losing
his position as acting boss,

26:35.361 --> 26:38.028
Vito Genovese forcefully
takes his seat

26:38.030 --> 26:40.698
at the head of the
Luciano crime family.

26:40.700 --> 26:44.702
(Genovese)
Take this away.
Bring me another one.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.837
(narrator)
And with Luciano in Italy

26:46.839 --> 26:49.707
and Costello out of
the picture,

26:49.709 --> 26:52.176
Genovese calls a secret meeting

26:52.178 --> 26:55.813
to announce the creation
of the Genovese crime family.

27:02.954 --> 27:06.857
In the fall of 1957,
Genovese invites mobsters

27:06.859 --> 27:11.295
from around the country
to upstate New York.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.631
(Selwyn Raab)
Vito Genovese decided

27:13.633 --> 27:15.633
there would be an
emergency meeting

27:15.635 --> 27:18.936
of the major crime bosses
from coast to coast,

27:18.938 --> 27:23.407
in a deserted farm area
called Apalachin, New York.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.376
There was no real
law enforcement,

27:25.378 --> 27:27.244
and they thought
they would be very safe.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.114
Hey, Tommy, how are ya?
Get over here.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.415
How are you?

27:31.417 --> 27:32.950
What do you think of the place?
Nice, huh?

27:32.952 --> 27:34.218
It's like being
on vacation, right?

27:34.220 --> 27:35.853
(laughs)

27:36.921 --> 27:38.822
Congratulations, Vito.
Thank you.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.392
(Genovese)
He did pass away.
he did pass away.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.993
Hey, there he is.
How you doing, pal?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.895
How you been, all right?
Good to see you again.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.165
(Michael Green)
The mob gets together
to divvy up, in a sense,

27:48.167 --> 27:50.234
what Anastasia had
left behind,

27:50.236 --> 27:53.737
and what Luciano isn't
able to control so well,

27:53.739 --> 27:54.938
now that he's back in Italy.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.740
Cheers to that, guys.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.175
Get a drink, get a drink.
Have a good time.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.810
We're here to have
a good time, celebrate.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.345
Thanks for coming up,
appreciate it.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.980
(Gay Talese)
Those who were
heads of families,

28:02.982 --> 28:06.183
they had a-- an ego,
a real sense of self.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.787
They saw themselves
as an alpha male,

28:09.789 --> 28:14.858
a leader, and they had
that-- that belief in self.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.694
Hey, how are you, pal?

28:16.696 --> 28:19.830
What are you doing?
(laughing)

28:19.832 --> 28:21.732
(narrator)
Genovese's lavish party

28:21.734 --> 28:27.371
in honor of himself draws more
than 100 major crime figures.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.907
But the big get-together
draws the attention

28:29.909 --> 28:31.408
of more than just the mob.

28:38.349 --> 28:41.452
And what started
as a celebration

28:41.454 --> 28:44.822
is about to become a disaster.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.729
â™ª

28:54.399 --> 28:57.134
(narrator)
In the fall of 1957,

28:57.136 --> 29:00.971
Vito Genovese calls the most
powerful mobsters in America

29:00.973 --> 29:04.908
to a meeting at a secluded
farmhouse in upstate New York...

29:07.011 --> 29:10.380
to confirm his status as
the head of the Mafia.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.849
How's it going?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.317
Thanks for coming up,
appreciate it.

29:15.220 --> 29:19.223
(narrator)
But the gathering
doesn't go unnoticed.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.495
(Selwyn Raab)
What happened was,
a state trooper

29:24.497 --> 29:27.397
noticed there was a lot
of strange people

29:27.399 --> 29:31.502
checking into a motel,
and a lot of big limousines

29:31.504 --> 29:36.106
were pulling into this town
and all heading for this farm.

29:36.108 --> 29:41.779
And he decided this was worth
some-- some inspection.

29:49.354 --> 29:52.856
And he called for backup
from the state police

29:52.858 --> 29:55.359
to surround this farmhouse.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.995
(overlapping chatter)

30:05.103 --> 30:06.436
(man)
Cops! Cops!
Get out of here!

30:06.438 --> 30:10.307
Get out of here, there's cops!
Go, go, go!

30:10.309 --> 30:12.075
(...)!

30:12.077 --> 30:14.845
â™ª

30:28.226 --> 30:29.993
Freeze!
Ahh!

30:33.998 --> 30:36.466
(handcuffs clicking)

30:41.239 --> 30:44.074
(Selwyn Raab)
There were major
crime bosses and their minions.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.077
About 70 people in there
started scattering.

30:49.948 --> 30:54.051
Some of them were rounded up,
and it led to some indictment.

30:55.286 --> 30:58.488
It put the Mafia,
really on page one.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.390
This was terrible.

31:02.126 --> 31:04.161
(narrator)
20 gangsters are arrested

31:04.163 --> 31:06.296
and charged with
obstruction of justice,

31:06.298 --> 31:10.467
making headlines around
the country.

31:10.469 --> 31:13.937
And while the charges
are later dropped,

31:13.939 --> 31:15.472
the meeting that
was meant to announce

31:15.474 --> 31:17.341
his dominance of the Mafia

31:17.343 --> 31:20.544
has turned into a major
embarrassment for Genovese.

31:25.516 --> 31:28.385
(Michael Green)
Mobsters do make mistakes.

31:28.387 --> 31:32.022
The question is whether
they can overcome the mistake.

31:32.024 --> 31:35.926
Vito Genovese made the mistake
of getting noticed,

31:35.928 --> 31:38.328
and it is going to go a long way

31:38.330 --> 31:42.633
toward reducing Genovese's
impact and influence.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.645
(narrator)
For Luciano,
the botched Mafia summit

31:54.647 --> 31:59.182
is just another blemish on
Genovese's list of failures.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.586
And the unpredictable mob boss
is threatening to destroy

32:02.588 --> 32:06.657
everything Luciano has built.

32:06.659 --> 32:11.561
(Richard Hammer)
Luciano felt that Genovese had
brought disrepute to the mob.

32:11.563 --> 32:15.165
He wanted Genovese
done, finished.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.268
(narrator)
But Luciano is about
to get the help he needs

32:18.270 --> 32:21.171
from an unexpected visitor--

32:21.173 --> 32:25.042
the man who's been
Genovese's closest ally,

32:25.044 --> 32:27.511
Carlo Gambino.

32:31.549 --> 32:35.552
After the Apalachin debacle,
Gambino sees an opportunity

32:35.554 --> 32:39.089
to use Genovese's failure
to his advantage.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.092
We need to make
some changes.

32:45.063 --> 32:46.630
What do you wanna do, Carlo?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.565
Send him away for life.

32:48.567 --> 32:53.170
Put him behind some bars
in a cage where he belongs.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.275
(narrator)
Luciano realizes he's working

32:58.277 --> 33:01.378
with a master strategist.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.580
He's watched Gambino rise
through the ranks

33:03.582 --> 33:08.585
of the New York Mafia
by any means necessary,

33:08.587 --> 33:13.223
the same way Luciano did
decades earlier.

33:13.225 --> 33:18.462
And now, the gangster is
about to make his final play.

33:18.464 --> 33:22.666
Luciano has every reason to
get rid of Vito Genovese.

33:22.668 --> 33:27.037
But he knows if he does,
he's effectively giving Gambino

33:27.039 --> 33:30.073
control of the American Mafia.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.418
(narrator)
Lucky Luciano must decide

33:41.420 --> 33:45.088
whether getting rid of
Vito Genovese for good

33:45.090 --> 33:48.425
is worth giving up the power
of the New York Mafia

33:48.427 --> 33:51.161
to Carlo Gambino.

33:54.132 --> 33:59.436
For years, Carlo Gambino has
been Luciano's bitter rival.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.272
Having arranged the murders
of two of his allies,

34:02.274 --> 34:06.176
Willie Moretti
and Albert Anastasia,

34:06.178 --> 34:08.111
and ordering the failed hit

34:08.113 --> 34:10.714
on one of Luciano's
closest friends,

34:10.716 --> 34:12.682
Frank Costello.

34:15.820 --> 34:21.091
But Luciano respects the
gangster's fearless tactics.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.626
Costello may have been smart,

34:22.628 --> 34:25.295
and Genovese
may have been cutthroat.

34:25.297 --> 34:29.533
But Gambino was both,
just like Luciano.

34:31.803 --> 34:36.073
Genovese's reign as boss
is about to come to an end.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.714
Gambino and Luciano
create a plan

34:44.716 --> 34:48.385
to get Vito Genovese
out of the picture for good.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.187
International call,
New York.

34:50.189 --> 34:53.256
â™ª

35:03.334 --> 35:07.437
(Rich Cohen)
Lucky Luciano conspired to
put Vito Genovese in prison

35:07.439 --> 35:10.607
by sort of dropping
a dime on him...

35:10.609 --> 35:12.242
making an anonymous call

35:12.244 --> 35:15.112
about he was dealing
heroin in America.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.555
(narrator)
Vito Genovese is found
guilty of smuggling

35:25.557 --> 35:28.592
and distributing narcotics,

35:28.594 --> 35:31.761
and is sentenced to
15 years in prison.

35:38.436 --> 35:43.573
In one swift move, Luciano has
gotten rid of his biggest rival

35:43.575 --> 35:46.543
and placed the organization
he created

35:46.545 --> 35:49.779
into the hands
of Carlo Gambino,

35:49.781 --> 35:52.382
the man he believes is most able

35:52.384 --> 35:55.452
to lead the Mafia
into the future.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.190
With Luciano's blessing,

36:00.192 --> 36:03.693
Carlo Gambino becomes the new
head of the Commission...

36:06.297 --> 36:09.900
ushering in a new era
of the American Mafia.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.481
While he's given up his power,

36:24.483 --> 36:29.419
Luciano remains influential
in the underworld,

36:29.421 --> 36:33.723
and settles into
a lasting relationship...

36:33.725 --> 36:35.492
Good morning.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.828
(narrator)
...with Italian dancer
Igea Lissoni.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.198
(Richard Hammer)
Luciano never married.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.801
In fact, he didn't really have
a long-standing relationship

36:44.803 --> 36:47.604
until he was
in Italy with Igea.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.472
(speaking Italian)

36:49.474 --> 36:52.509
(Richard Hammer)
I think Lucky's
involvement with Igea

36:52.511 --> 36:56.880
may be the one really
close attachment

36:56.882 --> 36:58.648
he had ever formed.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.352
This was someone
he cared about deeply.

37:02.354 --> 37:05.956
(narrator)
On January 26th, 1962,

37:05.958 --> 37:09.326
three years after
Igea passes...

37:12.563 --> 37:16.299
and having lived a life
unlike any other,

37:16.301 --> 37:19.703
Charles "Lucky" Luciano
dies suddenly of a heart attack

37:19.705 --> 37:22.939
in Naples at the age
of 64.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.946
News of the criminal kingpin's
death spreads quickly.

37:32.283 --> 37:35.385
Hundreds line the streets of
Naples to pay their respects

37:35.387 --> 37:38.922
to the man responsible for
creating the modern Mafia.

37:40.524 --> 37:44.361
And nearly 16 years
after being deported,

37:44.363 --> 37:48.498
Luciano finally gets his wish

37:48.500 --> 37:52.602
of returning to America
one last time.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.709
(Gambino)
I'd like to say a few
words about a great man

37:59.711 --> 38:02.312
and a dear friend.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.515
Salvatore Lucania.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.684
Charlie Luciano.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.553
Lucky.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.690
I've known many
people in my days,

38:13.692 --> 38:15.892
but there was only
one time when I knew

38:15.894 --> 38:18.361
I was in the presence
of greatness.

38:18.363 --> 38:23.700
And that's when I stood in
a room with Lucky Luciano.

38:23.702 --> 38:27.537
Lucky Luciano worked
his way up from the bottom.

38:27.539 --> 38:30.407
And when he became the boss,

38:30.409 --> 38:34.044
he had the respect of everybody,
from all the families,

38:34.046 --> 38:36.346
because of how he
worked his way up

38:36.348 --> 38:40.317
and was able to, one,
make money for everybody,

38:40.319 --> 38:44.554
keep everybody alive,
take care of everybody's family.

38:47.792 --> 38:51.895
(narrator)
The death of Luciano
signals the end of an era,

38:51.897 --> 38:56.733
as one by one, his original crew
begins to fade into history.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.570
Vito Genovese spends the rest
of his life in prison,

39:00.572 --> 39:03.406
where he'll continue
to run his crime family

39:03.408 --> 39:07.077
until he dies in 1969.

39:07.079 --> 39:10.080
He's buried just 100 feet
from his boss

39:10.082 --> 39:13.516
and greatest rival, Luciano.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.919
(Rudy Giuliani)
Vito Genovese probably thought

39:15.921 --> 39:19.923
that he was the closest thing
to another Lucky Luciano.

39:19.925 --> 39:23.660
I don't think Vito
rose to that level.

39:25.429 --> 39:29.632
(narrator)
Frank Costello lives out
his retirement in peace,

39:29.634 --> 39:33.103
remaining an influential figure
in the New York Mafia.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.438
To understand Frank Costello,
you have to understand

39:35.440 --> 39:37.874
that he craved respect.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.976
He had one foot in
the underworld,

39:39.978 --> 39:41.811
one foot in the
legitimate world.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.647
And as a result,
Frank Costello becomes known

39:44.649 --> 39:48.451
as the "Prime Minister
of the Underworld."

39:48.453 --> 39:51.621
(narrator)
In 1973, Costello passes away

39:51.623 --> 39:53.957
in his Manhattan apartment.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.129
Meyer Lansky
retires to Miami Beach,

39:59.131 --> 40:02.132
where he lives well
into his old age.

40:02.134 --> 40:05.735
If I were president, I would
have named Meyer Lansky

40:05.737 --> 40:08.805
Secretary of State and
Secretary of the Treasury.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.707
Never mind that he can't
have both jobs.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.410
The Treasury, he would have
gotten the budget balanced.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.811
State, we could have sent him

40:14.813 --> 40:16.746
to the Middle East,
he would have solved it.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.449
I'm not going to say that
I would have agreed

40:19.451 --> 40:21.518
with everything
Meyer Lansky did,

40:21.520 --> 40:23.887
but I would say that I
wouldn't have minded

40:23.889 --> 40:25.822
having him on my side.

40:25.824 --> 40:29.559
(narrator)
Lansky dies in 1983

40:29.561 --> 40:33.830
with only $37,000 to his name,

40:33.832 --> 40:36.933
although the FBI believes
he stashed away

40:36.935 --> 40:40.937
more than 300 million
in secret bank accounts.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.544
In just over a half a century,

40:47.546 --> 40:50.213
Lucky Luciano,
Frank Costello,

40:50.215 --> 40:53.483
Meyer Lansky,
Bugsy Siegel,

40:53.485 --> 40:56.853
and Vito Genovese
worked together to become

40:56.855 --> 41:00.023
the most successful criminals
the world has ever known,

41:00.025 --> 41:03.560
organizing crime into a
multimillion-dollar industry

41:03.562 --> 41:09.199
and leaving behind a legacy
that forever changes America.

41:09.201 --> 41:13.470
(H.W. Brands)
The Mafia became
an avenue to success.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.706
And in its own way,
it was a recapitulation

41:16.708 --> 41:18.708
of the American dream.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.210
You come to America,

41:20.212 --> 41:23.613
you work hard,
you work smart,

41:23.615 --> 41:26.216
and in time, success
rewards your endeavors.

41:26.218 --> 41:29.219
There is a certain
ruthlessness.

41:29.221 --> 41:32.722
There's a certain willingness
to do whatever it takes.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.724
And they're surviving
on their wits.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.893
They're surviving
on their guile.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.629
And these were the
charismatic mobsters.

41:39.631 --> 41:41.064
(Rich Cohen)
The funny thing about the Mafia

41:41.066 --> 41:42.899
is there's all this mythology
around it

41:42.901 --> 41:45.235
about Sicily
and the old world.

41:45.237 --> 41:48.771
Really, the Mafia that we know
is as American as jazz.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.741
It's about this
mixed group of guys.

41:51.743 --> 41:55.812
They turned crime into
big business.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.680
(gunfire)

41:57.682 --> 42:00.083
(Rudy Giuliani)
This street level group of thugs

42:00.085 --> 42:04.087
organized into a very
sophisticated organization.

42:04.089 --> 42:08.024
It infiltrated the unions,
it infiltrated politics.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.859
It infiltrated Hollywood.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.961
I can't think of
another example

42:11.963 --> 42:13.296
of an organized crime group

42:13.298 --> 42:16.299
that had the grip the Mafia
had on America.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.935
Totally criminal,
totally amoral,

42:18.937 --> 42:22.238
totally horrible,
but totally brilliant.

42:27.311 --> 42:31.581
â™ª
