00:09.385 --> 00:11.260
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:11.345 --> 00:13.096
l started leaning on painkillers.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.222
There is nothing to be worried about.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.348
For the pain.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.433
-Percocet?
-Yes, please.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.269
-Already worried.
-Don't be.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.107
Did she give you a whole song and dance
about her back?

00:24.191 --> 00:26.067
You can't believe a word she says.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.569
l don't know whose MRl you saw,
but it wasn't hers.

00:29.655 --> 00:30.697
l'm here to see Jackie Peyton.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.365
-And you are?
-Her husband.

00:32.574 --> 00:33.574
Jackie's not married.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.368
l don't keep secrets, Jackie.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.078
Kevin, neither do l.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.540
l never would have gotten involved
if l knew you were married.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.959
This lies on top of lies crap...

00:43.043 --> 00:44.877
Maybe you can live like that, l can't.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.004
-Hi, guys.
-Mom!

00:47.089 --> 00:50.883
We've been exploring the possibility
of medication.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.260
Really, Grace?

00:52.344 --> 00:53.970
One's on meds,
the other one's starting fires.

00:54.430 --> 00:56.472
Whatever we're doing is messing them up.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.809
HR has issued mandatory urine tests.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.603
-Hope you're happy.
-l'm not.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.188
Fuck 'em.

01:04.273 --> 01:05.440
l can't look at her lately.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.108
There's all this unspoken shit
hanging there.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.735
You gotta know what l'm talking about.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.570
We got a problem. Kevin knows.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.738
He doesn't know anything.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.449
Kevin's in admitting. With the girls.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.868
All right, l'm here.
Just say what you fucking gotta say.

01:16.952 --> 01:17.994
l had an affair.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.461
Pack your bags.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.816
No phone, no caffeine, no makeup.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.567
Okay.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.820
Unzip it, please.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.033
lf you want to go through my bag,
be my guest.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.201
l'm not your guest.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.203
Please open the bag.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.708
Empty it out, please.

02:56.218 --> 02:59.554
-Did anybody help you pack?
-No.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.431
And it was in your possession
the whole time?

03:02.558 --> 03:03.641
What am l, getting on a plane?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.435
Yes, l packed my own bag.
lt's been in my possession the whole time.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.979
Let's make this really clear.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.731
You're accountable now
for every item in this bag,

03:10.816 --> 03:12.608
every word out of your mouth,
every move you make.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.071
That's my toothpaste.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.408
Guess how many nurses crush up their oxy
and reseal their toothpaste.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.869
Don't test me.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.121
There's toothpaste in the bathroom.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.207
-l'm here to get better, not worse.
-We'll see.

03:30.627 --> 03:34.255
From what l've seen so far,
detox is gonna be a bitch.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.299
Welcome to rehab.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.079
Quantum Bay. Here you go.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.706
l can't believe they bought All Saints.

04:08.790 --> 04:14.837
This is what they own. Hotels, firearms,
railways, tobacco and baby food.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.882
They sound busy.
Maybe they'll leave us alone.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.926
Hilarious. l didn't get lunch.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.552
No one did.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.970
Key change.

04:23.639 --> 04:26.641
Has anyone else noticed
that O'Hara's looking a little puffy?

04:27.059 --> 04:29.143
Kettle, kettle, black, black.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.107
Sorry. l thought you were gone for the day.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.859
Nope. Leaving now.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.909
Hey, Jackie. l got something for you.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.996
-Can't it wait till tomorrow?
-No, it'll just take a sec. Come on.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.880
So, l was walking by a church,

04:57.965 --> 05:00.800
and this is just sitting there on a step.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.259
Pretty fucking perfect, huh?

05:02.552 --> 05:05.596
No blindsides, Eddie, okay? Not today.
l really can't handle it.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.307
l've waited a respectable amount
of time, Jackie.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.560
And l've laid low and l can stay low
as long as you want me to.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.979
Don't do this, please. Don't do this.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.147
Well, l'm doing it.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.149
Now we can take it nice and slow.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.360
l can take you out on a date.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.445
Maybe a little moonlight.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.449
What?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.828
lt's not a thrill if we're not sneaking around?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.663
lt only works if l'm forbidden fruit?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.583
Forbidden fruit? Really?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.794
Slater's AWOL. l need you for another hour.

05:36.878 --> 05:37.920
l'm off the clock.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.839
Well, get back on.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.178
Oxy sat.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.638
Any word from the lCU?

05:47.723 --> 05:49.265
l don't know. l'm not...

05:49.349 --> 05:51.308
Oxygen levels, what are they?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.686
By the way, crying on the floor, not cool.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.354
l'm not a nurse. l'm his girlfriend.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.152
l'm a dog groomer. l came right from work.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.237
l'm so sorry.
l thought you were a temp nurse.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.948
l told him it didn't matter.
We should come to the ER.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.576
Someone should look at it
'cause we'll just fuck it up.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.078
Well, you're here now.
We're gonna take very good care of him.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.040
Yeah, but that English lady said
his organs might shut down.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.168
We're gonna have plenty of warning signs
if that's gonna happen.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.419
We're on it. Don't you worry.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.755
l will be right back.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.431
Not great timing, fully aware,
but l love your scrubs.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.364
Watch yourself.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.200
Watch your own fucking self.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.951
ls that really necessary?

06:51.036 --> 06:53.996
To get your doctor head
out of your doctor ass, yeah, l guess it is.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.415
My hands are full, yours aren't.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.590
-He can't die.
-l know, honey.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.050
Here, put something in your stomach.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.885
You're not gonna want to eat in the lCU,
believe me.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.722
Good night and good luck.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.279
-Here's the thing.
-Fuck, you scared me.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.115
Yeah, l kind of doubt that.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.243
Fuck, here goes nothing.

07:32.369 --> 07:36.330
Jackie Peyton,
were you sleeping with me for my drugs?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.084
You know, l'm not even gonna dignify that.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.377
Dignify it.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.006
Did the drugs figure in? l don't know.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.051
Probably. l guess. l don't know.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.512
You don't know?

07:51.596 --> 07:54.014
Did you love me? Do you know that?

07:56.685 --> 07:57.935
Answer me.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.231
Was l gonna run away
and start a life with you? No, l was not.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.446
You want to do yourself in, go right ahead.
Leave the rest of us alone.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.699
Fucking seriously.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.160
God help you, Jackie.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.057
That fish is going to be so fat.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.063
l just wish they'd get over themselves.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.275
Her more than him.
lt's his house. He bought it.

08:47.277 --> 08:51.071
Bailey Dickler's dad lives
in the same building Dad does.

08:51.239 --> 08:55.075
Bailey Dickler's dad wanted to move out,
our dad didn't.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.745
l still like the pool.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.996
Dad!

09:00.957 --> 09:03.417
You ready? What do you need, Fi?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.003
lf you move back in,
can we still go to the pool?

09:06.087 --> 09:09.757
lf l move back in, l will dig you a pool
with my own bare hands.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.717
Let's go, guys.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.824
Buy you a drink?

10:22.789 --> 10:24.123
l got two.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.418
No one really talks
to each other anymore, though.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.420
Kids or wives?

10:29.504 --> 10:30.963
Both. Either.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.048
l don't know. How many kids you got?

10:34.718 --> 10:35.843
lt's just me.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.764
You're full of shit.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.059
That l am.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.106
-You're pretty.
-l'm pretty fucked up.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.714
You know that expression "sheer bliss"?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.341
No, not really.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.302
Well, steer clear,

11:18.553 --> 11:23.932
'cause they put the sheer
in front of the bliss

11:24.017 --> 11:27.895
because they know
that the bliss eventually is gonna evaporate.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.814
l got high this one time,

11:31.399 --> 11:37.780
and it was about six years ago,
and this bliss,

11:39.240 --> 11:41.700
it came at me, like, in waves. You know?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.621
And it felt like a fucking regiment.
You know?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.625
l've been chasing it like a ghost ever since.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.837
And no matter how hard l try
or how far l reach, l just can't get it.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.049
lt's like, what's the fucking point,
you know?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.263
You want to go again?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.307
Yes.

12:06.893 --> 12:07.976
Good.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.923
Are you okay? Are you okay?

12:40.051 --> 12:43.429
All right, come here. Lay down.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.306
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.725
Okay, don't fight me. Easy, easy.

12:48.810 --> 12:50.060
Oh, God.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.325
Oh, my God. Fuck. Really?

13:19.591 --> 13:22.718
No. No, l'm all right.
How fast can you get over here?

13:23.720 --> 13:27.264
No, wait. You're gonna want to judge me.
Just don't judge me. Just don't.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.101
Okay, this begs a judgment.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.562
Can we get him in your town car?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.274
Are you out of your mind?
lsn't that a stupid question?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.611
-No, we cannot get him in my town car.
-Well, he can't stay here.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.529
On that we agree.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.034
Lenny. l can call Lenny.
Lenny's got his own rig. He lives in Queens.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.327
l can call... l'm gonna call Lenny.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.788
Do me a favor. Plug your ears.
You're gonna hate this.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.082
l hate everything about this.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.678
-Hello?
-Lenny, hi. lt's Jackie.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.846
l'm sorry... l'm sorry to wake you up.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.390
l need your help.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.477
l'm looking out my window here
and l'm seeing this guy staggering around.

14:13.561 --> 14:17.064
l think he's having a heart...
There he goes. He just fell down again.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.441
He's having a heart attack or something,
I don't know.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.777
-l can't really tell. l'm gonna go out there.
-Where are you?

14:21.861 --> 14:25.364
-48th, between 6th and Wade.
-l'll be right there.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.617
Okay, yeah. Keep the sirens off, okay?
There's kids sleeping around here.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.826
Okay.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.622
You want to go on a ride-along? Yep.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.754
And the Oscar goes to dot, dot, dot.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.133
You can't sit.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.010
He's gonna be here in two minutes.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.096
You've got to help me clean up.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.223
-Nope.
-No?

14:51.307 --> 14:54.101
l'll declare the body dead,
l'll sign what l need to sign and be gone.

14:54.185 --> 14:55.811
Gone from this house, gone from your life.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.646
l am done cleaning up after you.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.439
And l'm not judging.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.317
lf anything,
l hold myself entirely responsible.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.319
Well, don't. Okay?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.905
l killed my marriage. l fucked up my kids.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.950
l'm the reason
that Eddie has a fucking gun to his head.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.743
l'm the one with the pee test in a computer

15:11.828 --> 15:14.663
ready to jump out
like a fucking jack-in-the-box. l did it!

15:17.959 --> 15:20.377
So what do l do?
l go to a church, l pick up a stranger,

15:20.461 --> 15:21.628
and l nearly fuck him to death.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.172
He's not nearly dead. He's dead!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.633
l nearly fucked him, not he's nearly dead.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.385
Well, that's completely different.

15:28.469 --> 15:33.056
Look, there's nothing left to wreck,
but l can't stop wrecking.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.439
l can't stop. And l want to and l don't.
And l can't...

15:43.151 --> 15:45.986
Somebody just needs to fucking lock me up.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.407
God, l think l need to go to rehab.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.046
-You have guests.
-l have guests.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.010
We're here. Hi!

16:11.387 --> 16:12.929
Okay, not a bridal shower.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.183
You haul him in here yourself?

16:17.518 --> 16:20.604
Oh, my God! And hi! l mean, hi.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.190
-Very sad.
-Yeah.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.233
How did he...

16:25.318 --> 16:27.694
ls he a cardiac arrest or an overdose?

16:28.112 --> 16:29.738
-Cardiac arrest.
-Cardiac arrest.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.241
Feels kind of druggy, though, right?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.410
You are not wrong.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.704
You are an awesome neighbor.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.373
And you are an awesome doctor.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.668
Out here in the middle of the night,
that shit's professional.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.961
Voices down. Girls are sleeping.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.548
Way to live the job, ladies.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.471
We need to get you out of here.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.348
Let's do this.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.393
-l'll get the feet.
-l'll get the head.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.479
Yes, Wednesday's fantastic.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.481
l will change my mind by Wednesday.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.317
Okay, cancel that. We need to do this today.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.653
No, l will not hold. God.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.114
l'm on hold.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.492
-lt's 28 Days. They specialize in pills.
-Me, too.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.121
Yes, l'm still here.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.708
Good. That's more like it.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.835
Bye.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.589
You'll be joining them on the lido deck
at 4:00 pm.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.092
l suggest you get your ducks in a row.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.305
l got to talk to Akalitus. Shit.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.892
The sun's coming up.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.687
lt always does.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.606
l don't know what planet you're living on.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.031
Hey. Look who's awake.
How are you guys doing?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.075
l feel way better than l did, that's for sure.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.994
You were nearly dead, Dustin.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.872
Wow, look at that.
White blood cells going up.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.457
You guys packing for the lCU?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.251
Dustin wants to go home.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.587
Sweetie, no.

18:08.671 --> 18:09.963
How am l gonna pay for this?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.465
He wants to dine and dash.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.924
Don't tell her that.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.927
Look, if l could sneak you out the back door
with a couple of pills,

18:16.012 --> 18:17.387
believe me, l would do it.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.805
But l'm starting to feel better.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.559
That's because you spent the night
on supplemental oxygen and lV fluids.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.730
You're gonna need 72 hours of bed rest
and intravenous antibiotics.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.899
This is not something you can do
on your couch.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.943
Will you do me a favor
and let me see if l can hurry up the lCU?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.989
Yeah, fine. Do it.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.829
Even if you get a bed, he'll still leave.
He doesn't believe he'll die.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.915
Just keep him in here until l get back.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.876
-How?
-Sit on him. He's too weak to push you off.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.336
Just do it.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.131
May l have your attention, please?

18:53.216 --> 18:54.424
Hey, everybody.

18:54.509 --> 18:57.177
Listen, l know you're all busy,
so just keep doing what you're doing,

18:57.261 --> 18:59.805
and while you do,
l'll go ahead and introduce myself.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.807
My name is Mike Cruz.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.059
Some of you might have seen me
in the hallway.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.395
l am a physician
and l work for Quantum Bay,

19:08.022 --> 19:09.564
but l also work for you.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.733
Seriously, it's okay. Keep working.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.694
Here's the deal.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.241
We're taking All Saints into the future.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.452
-But the present is so handsome.
-Thanks.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.662
Keep breathing, Thor.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.413
As l was saying,

19:25.498 --> 19:29.668
l have seen beleaguered hospitals
metamorphose into profitable,

19:29.961 --> 19:32.671
dynamic medical centers
time and time again.

19:32.755 --> 19:37.092
And it always begins right here in trauma,
the linchpin of the hospital.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.593
You ought to be really proud.

19:38.678 --> 19:43.974
We do great works. We do charitable works,
but we are not a charity.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.518
Thanks for listening.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.819
You left the floor while he was still talking.
Unacceptable.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.573
He said to keep working.
That's what l did. Zoey, bed two.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.246
Dustin and Cori, this is Zoey.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.709
Zoey, l need you to show Cori
how to start a line and administer meds.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.588
We're sending him home
with 72 hours of intravenous antibiotics.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.673
l need you to get them cab fare
and get them out of here.

20:17.425 --> 20:21.052
Cori, give your number to Zoey
so she can check in, which she will,

20:21.137 --> 20:22.554
every three hours around the clock.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.222
She doesn't have to call at night.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.682
Yes, l do.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.143
Dustin, don't be an idiot.
Something happens at 4:00 in the morning,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.477
she's your girl.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.022
Zoey Barkow, most reliable nurse l know.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.899
Rely on her.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.408
Oh, no, you don't.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.039
l thought l had till 4:00.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.832
Well, they can take you now.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.627
-You seem eager to get rid of me.
-l am.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.970
Okay, so...

21:04.972 --> 21:07.182
l'm sorry if l made a bad impression
on Mike Cruz

21:07.266 --> 21:09.434
during his Jerry Maguire moment
or whatever the hell that was.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.686
-That was not my intention.
-Well, what was your intention?

21:12.396 --> 21:13.980
-To leave early.
-No.

21:14.065 --> 21:17.150
Gloria, l need to leave,
and l need to cash in my vacation days.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.237
Yeah, yeah, l do.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.448
And l'm not talking about a week.
l'm talking about

21:24.492 --> 21:31.748
28 days.

21:36.671 --> 21:37.712
Where are you going?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.007
Disneyland.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.676
When are they expecting you?

21:43.219 --> 21:44.469
Today. Now.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.222
This is not good timing.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.015
l know. l'm sorry.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.059
lt's a small window. lf l don't get in,

21:51.143 --> 21:52.644
they're gonna give my bed
to somebody else.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.021
Well, yes, that is how Disneyland works.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.857
Go.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.402
Don't be late.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.698
Jackie.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.034
Do what they say.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.662
l will. Thanks.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.501
Car's out front.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.378
What am l gonna tell my kids?

22:18.462 --> 22:23.508
Maternity. Radiology. Oncology.
Respectable earners.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.844
Who's the short one?

22:25.928 --> 22:28.763
Jackie Peyton. Nurse Jackie.

22:28.848 --> 22:29.931
Tall one's O'Hara.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.309
We used to be in a locked-horn pitch battle
like two-rams-on-the-side-of-a-cliff thing.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.770
She wanted to be chief.
You want an introduction?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.606
l got it. Hey, you gonna pay
for those meds you stole during my intro?

22:39.817 --> 22:41.234
Dock my pay.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.112
Pull up your trousers.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.906
That's Jackie.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.620
And l have to go. l'm sorry.
lt's a work thing. We have new owners.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.956
lt's just a month. lt's four little weeks.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.666
Dad got us a Wii.

22:56.751 --> 22:57.959
Well, have a good month.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.005
You want to say hi to Dr. O'Hara?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.590
Say hi.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.636
You okay? You look a little...

23:08.929 --> 23:12.891
l'm fine. lt's a training thing.
All the nurses have to go.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.726
We have to get recertified.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.437
-All right, l've got to go, Kev.
-Yeah.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.523
Grace, Fi. Let's go back up.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.285
Dr. Cruz, welcome.

23:32.620 --> 23:37.373
There's a razor-thin line
between life and death, profit and loss.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.750
l know you know all this.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.418
l pulled your file. You're smart.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.420
Thank you. Thank you very much.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.757
And at the risk of embarrassing myself
by stating the obvious

23:45.841 --> 23:49.511
to someone who's been doing this
as long and as well as you have,

23:49.595 --> 23:53.515
the mortal enemy of efficiency
is redundancy.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.266
Well, it's not that obvious.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.392
No need to be modest.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.311
lt's an impressive career.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.105
l mean, two years away from your pension.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.067
Wait, l'm not here
to take money from pensions

24:04.151 --> 24:06.402
or to swap out old-timers for college kids.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.446
College kids don't have the value.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.783
l came here right from college.
l like to think l had value.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.993
You did. And you do.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.746
But the fact of the matter is l'm here now.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.749
So this job, yourjob,

24:20.501 --> 24:21.835
is redundant.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.507
-l don't think it is.
-Well, we'll agree to disagree.

24:28.843 --> 24:30.093
l am here now.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.970
And that means we have a couple
of options.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.514
Now, you can go back on the floor,
work as a nurse,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.683
work for two years, the pension stays intact.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.518
And the other option?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.311
Cash out at half.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.356
Am l still their boss?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.692
ls that important to you?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.402
l wouldn't have asked.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.864
Then it's important to me.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.579
lt's cold season, Dr. Cruz.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.296
What's up, man?

25:07.339 --> 25:08.590
We got to talk.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.468
Are you drunk?
lt's not a good time. The girls are here.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.138
l know the girls are here.
That's why l'm here.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.307
'Cause you're gonna lose your shit

25:17.391 --> 25:20.059
and you can't kill me if they're here.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.396
You don't got an ax in here, do you?

25:23.480 --> 25:24.564
Go home, Eddie.

25:24.648 --> 25:29.819
Kev, you got to take yourself off the hook
about fucking that girl.

25:30.696 --> 25:36.201
'Cause l know for a fact Jackie was fucking
some retarded sad sack for years.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.662
We're talking years, Kevin. Like four.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.332
And it was me.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.125
She was fucking me.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.591
Take it easy, man!

25:54.762 --> 25:55.887
Easy!

26:04.355 --> 26:06.231
That's it. That's all you get.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.949
Hey, guys. You want to live with Dad?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.201
l am paying you back.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.119
-Nonsense.
-lt's not nonsense.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.038
Things are gonna be different
when l get out.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.456
Yeah, well, they've got to be.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.502
l can't go pulling you out of fires anymore.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.047
l'm 1 6 weeks.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.678
You're pregnant?

26:38.264 --> 26:39.472
Really?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.225
Why didn't you tell me?

26:42.851 --> 26:44.978
Well, let's review, shall we?

26:45.062 --> 26:47.313
How many times have you lied to my face,

26:47.439 --> 26:49.357
tricked me into writing checks
and prescriptions

26:49.650 --> 26:51.234
while all the time snorting God knows what

26:51.318 --> 26:54.320
and trying to make me believe l was actually
making a difference in your life?

27:12.548 --> 27:14.173
For safekeeping.
