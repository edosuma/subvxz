00:00.328 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:02.196 --> 00:03.062
I just got out of a meeting with

00:03.096 --> 00:04.163
<i>the builder for the restaurant.</i>

00:04.198 --> 00:05.364
It'll be another 350k each.

00:05.399 --> 00:06.432
Are you kidding?

00:06.646 --> 00:07.646
You won $5 million in a lawsuit...

00:07.681 --> 00:09.215
where did it all go?

00:09.249 --> 00:12.184
I kept thinking I'd turn it around.

00:12.219 --> 00:13.619
And I will with this restaurant.

00:13.653 --> 00:15.454
<i>Daphne: Guys like Coto work the system</i>

00:15.489 --> 00:17.456
and trade favors. It makes me sick.

00:17.491 --> 00:19.358
<i>Secretary: Senator Coto, there's a reporter</i>

00:19.393 --> 00:21.160
<i>from the "Star" out here
waiting to talk to you.</i>

00:21.274 --> 00:24.443
I'm supposed to pick some pieces
to show this Pratt recruiter.

00:24.478 --> 00:27.546
Whatever can make you
stand out is valuable.

00:27.581 --> 00:29.215
I was thinking about applying to schools

00:29.249 --> 00:31.717
- that have a strong pre-med program.
- Pre-med.

00:31.751 --> 00:34.320
Toby left us this note
on his way to the airport.

00:34.354 --> 00:35.654
- Iceland.
- Iceland?

00:35.689 --> 00:37.423
The crew that Nacho runs with,

00:37.491 --> 00:38.424
they can do a lot more than throw

00:38.458 --> 00:40.326
bricks through your window.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.361
- I got my job back.
- On the East Riverside project?

00:42.395 --> 00:45.231
Are you determined to get yourself hurt?

00:45.265 --> 00:46.432
Why don't you come to the shooting range?

00:46.466 --> 00:47.666
I'll show you how to protect yourself.

00:47.701 --> 00:48.767
Absolutely not!

00:48.802 --> 00:50.369
<i>Regina: I think I'm being followed.</i>

00:50.403 --> 00:51.537
<i>There's a man in the parking lot,</i>

00:51.571 --> 00:52.538
where I work. I think he's waiting for me.

00:52.572 --> 00:54.540
I would like to take you up on your offer.

00:54.574 --> 00:56.275
I want you to teach me how to shoot.

00:57.677 --> 00:59.645
(Cell phone ringing)

00:59.679 --> 01:01.380
Kathryn: Ohh.

01:01.414 --> 01:02.681
(Sighs)

01:04.351 --> 01:06.318
Oh.

01:06.353 --> 01:08.320
(Sighs deeply)

01:08.355 --> 01:09.522
(Groggily) Hello?

01:12.392 --> 01:15.261
Oh, no.

01:15.295 --> 01:17.263
- What? What is it?
- Oh...

01:17.297 --> 01:20.366
(Exhales) There's been an accident.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.369

_

01:31.284 --> 01:34.420
(Gunshots)

01:34.454 --> 01:36.622
You're pulling to the left.

01:36.656 --> 01:38.324
Just breathe out first.

01:40.527 --> 01:41.694
(Exhales)

01:44.397 --> 01:45.531
(Gunshot)

01:45.565 --> 01:46.832
Nice!

01:46.866 --> 01:48.267
Are you sure you haven't

01:48.301 --> 01:49.368
done this before?

01:49.402 --> 01:51.370
I never wanna do it again.

01:51.404 --> 01:53.372
You can't be afraid of it.

01:53.406 --> 01:55.307
It's just a tool.

01:55.342 --> 01:57.443
That is a deadly weapon.

01:57.477 --> 01:58.510
It's a means of self-defense.

01:58.545 --> 01:59.545
If you've got one of these,

01:59.579 --> 02:01.313
no one's gonna mess with you.

02:01.348 --> 02:03.215
You just keep it locked,

02:03.249 --> 02:04.516
and you're always the one in control.

02:04.551 --> 02:06.218
Have you ever used yours?

02:06.252 --> 02:07.553
No, but there's been

02:07.587 --> 02:09.588
a few times where I'm glad I had it.

02:09.703 --> 02:11.403
(Sighs)

02:11.438 --> 02:12.805
I'll keep it at work,

02:12.839 --> 02:14.606
but it's never coming home with me.

02:14.641 --> 02:15.774
Well, there you go.

02:15.809 --> 02:17.309
Permit's inside.

02:17.343 --> 02:19.878
This is only till we're
done with East Riverside.

02:19.913 --> 02:22.381
Oh, yeah, I booked a
dinner with a member of

02:22.415 --> 02:23.615
the fourth city council district.

02:23.650 --> 02:25.317
I want you to come with me.

02:25.351 --> 02:26.318
Okay, when?

02:26.352 --> 02:27.553
Tonight.

02:27.587 --> 02:29.421
What?

02:29.456 --> 02:30.622
You suddenly remembered

02:30.657 --> 02:31.757
you needed the latina?

02:31.791 --> 02:33.859
You're my partner on the project.

02:33.893 --> 02:35.461
You make the case for the community

02:35.495 --> 02:37.596
better than I ever could.

02:37.630 --> 02:40.899
And, frankly, I could use the company.

02:42.402 --> 02:44.703
Okay. Fine.

02:44.738 --> 02:46.805
Good.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
Let's get the mockups.

02:47.874 --> 02:48.841
I'll meet you at K&D.

02:48.875 --> 02:49.842
Okay.

Oh, my God. Pratt.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.800
_

03:16.770 --> 03:19.438
<i>Hallo?! Eg er komin heim.</i>

03:21.474 --> 03:22.641
In Icelandic that means

03:22.675 --> 03:24.643
"hello, I'm home!"

03:24.677 --> 03:25.878
Wow, hi!

03:25.912 --> 03:27.613
<i>Kathryn: John, we're back!</i>

03:28.882 --> 03:30.749
- How was it?
- Uh!

03:30.784 --> 03:32.818
It was exactly what I needed.

03:32.852 --> 03:34.753
Awesome.

03:34.788 --> 03:35.854
I think I like the scruff?

03:35.889 --> 03:37.589
Thank you.

03:37.694 --> 03:39.661
Does he look skinny to you?

03:39.696 --> 03:41.430
How are you?

03:41.464 --> 03:42.431
A-okay.

03:45.535 --> 03:46.602
This is unacceptable!

03:46.636 --> 03:48.403
I wanna talk to Christy.

03:50.506 --> 03:52.474
Tell... tell her to call me tonight.

03:52.508 --> 03:53.475
Thanks.

03:55.678 --> 03:57.646
Have you seen my S.A.T. study book?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.848
I... I think it was on the table.

03:59.883 --> 04:02.517
No, I had it with me when
I went down to the clinic.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.620
Oh, I hope I didn't leave it there.

04:04.654 --> 04:06.788
Sorry. Sorry.

04:06.823 --> 04:08.357
Worse traffic ever.

04:08.391 --> 04:09.825
Have you seen my S.A.T. book?

04:09.859 --> 04:11.593
The one that's been attached
to your face all week?

04:11.628 --> 04:13.462
<i>Yeah, I can't find it,</i>

04:13.496 --> 04:15.664
and it has all my practice
tests, all my notes.

04:15.698 --> 04:17.766
All right, all right. Let's look around.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.401
It's gotta be here.

04:19.435 --> 04:20.402
I think...

04:20.435 --> 04:21.570
I think we all need a break.

04:21.603 --> 04:22.905
How about I makes us dinner tonight?

04:22.939 --> 04:24.773
Oh, sorry.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.541
Wes just asked me to join him

04:26.576 --> 04:28.710
at some dinner with some city councilwoman.

04:28.745 --> 04:30.712
Does this guy ever take a night off?

04:30.747 --> 04:33.782
I know, but it's really important.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.518
Okay, but... we need to talk.

04:36.552 --> 04:38.420
What is it?

04:38.454 --> 04:39.621
Knock knock.

04:39.656 --> 04:42.524
Hey, guess who just got back from Iceland?

04:42.558 --> 04:43.592
Toby's home?

04:43.626 --> 04:44.593
Yeah.

04:44.627 --> 04:45.827
Let's go say hi, come on.

04:50.867 --> 04:52.401
Here he is!

04:52.435 --> 04:53.802
- Oh!
- Look at the world traveler.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.470
Oh, wow, the whole welcoming committee.

04:55.505 --> 04:56.505
Welcome home.

04:56.539 --> 04:57.873
Look at your hair.

04:57.907 --> 05:00.442
But seriously, what's on your face?

05:00.476 --> 05:01.877
- (All laugh)
- Was it fun?

05:01.911 --> 05:03.478
Wasn't it cold?

05:03.513 --> 05:04.846
You know, there wasn't
a whole lot of daylight,

05:04.881 --> 05:06.782
but I still had a blast.

05:06.816 --> 05:07.849
That's my boy.

05:07.884 --> 05:10.419
You can tell us all about
it at dinner tonight.

05:10.453 --> 05:11.653
Everybody is invited.

05:11.688 --> 05:13.889
I have no idea what time zone I'm in,

05:13.923 --> 05:15.524
but dinner sounds great.

05:15.558 --> 05:16.792
Excellent. I'm gonna fire up the grill.

05:16.826 --> 05:18.360
(Chuckles)

05:18.394 --> 05:19.861
<i>Unfortunately, I have a work thing.</i>

05:19.896 --> 05:21.596
But I can stop by tomorrow.

05:21.631 --> 05:23.498
And I'll be there as soon as I find

05:23.533 --> 05:25.701
my stupid S.A.T. book.

05:25.735 --> 05:27.669
Ah, the "sadistic act of torture."

05:27.704 --> 05:29.504
(Exhales) It's tomorrow.

05:29.539 --> 05:31.907
- Ohh...
- And she is completely obsessed

05:31.941 --> 05:33.408
with this magic book.

05:33.443 --> 05:35.644
Well, it has all the practice tests.

05:35.678 --> 05:37.846
- See?
- Let's go to the clinic.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.414
I'll help you look for it.

05:39.449 --> 05:40.582
Are you sure you don't mind?

05:40.616 --> 05:42.384
No problem. We can solve this.

05:42.418 --> 05:44.419
Angelo moved in.

05:44.454 --> 05:46.421
Oh. Wow. Well, uh...

05:46.456 --> 05:47.656
welcome to the compound.

05:47.690 --> 05:49.458
- Thanks.
- All right.

05:49.492 --> 05:51.693
I've gotta go get ready. Welcome back.

05:51.728 --> 05:52.694
Thanks.

05:53.830 --> 05:54.896
- Bye.
- Good to see you.

05:54.931 --> 05:56.398
- You too, man.
- See you. Bye.

05:56.432 --> 05:58.934
Well, looks to me like
we're gonna have an old-time

05:58.968 --> 06:00.535
Kennish party then.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.437
Um, I actually...

06:02.472 --> 06:04.339
gotta go start this English lit thing.

06:04.374 --> 06:06.742
Bay, come on. Stay with us.

06:06.776 --> 06:08.577
You're gonna be at art school soon.

06:08.611 --> 06:10.579
I mean, how many of these times

06:10.613 --> 06:11.880
do we get together?

06:13.716 --> 06:15.384
Kennish party it is.

06:19.689 --> 06:22.357
(Alarm beeping)

06:22.392 --> 06:23.892
- (Beeping)
- (Alarm stops)

06:25.661 --> 06:27.629
Okay, I had it at the desk.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.569
Um, should I look upstairs?

06:34.604 --> 06:35.904
No, I wasn't up there.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.606
(Quietly) Where is it?

06:39.709 --> 06:40.909
<i>Hey.</i>

06:40.943 --> 06:43.879
Why are you taking this test again?

06:43.913 --> 06:45.647
I thought you had a good score.

06:45.681 --> 06:47.582
I need an incredible score

06:47.617 --> 06:50.419
if I'm gonna get in to one
of these premed programs.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.888
You've been studying so hard.

06:52.922 --> 06:55.590
Maybe it's time to take a rest.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.692
But I keep making mistakes.

06:57.727 --> 06:59.795
I go over it and I go over it...

06:59.829 --> 07:01.329
What is this?

07:01.364 --> 07:02.764
What's going on?

07:02.799 --> 07:04.466
(Sighs)

07:07.770 --> 07:09.838
My mom and grandma

07:09.872 --> 07:11.473
and John and Kathryn

07:11.507 --> 07:14.876
keep bragging about what a
great doctor I'm gonna be.

07:17.513 --> 07:20.382
But what if I can't even get in?

07:20.416 --> 07:22.384
What if I let everyone down?

07:22.418 --> 07:24.553
You're not gonna let us down.

07:26.422 --> 07:27.856
You need to get out of your head.

07:27.890 --> 07:29.591
It's like me with my golf swing.

07:30.893 --> 07:33.762
Just let go and forget everything.

07:39.635 --> 07:41.403
It's not here.

07:43.439 --> 07:44.606
I'm totally screwed.

07:46.776 --> 07:48.844
I have an idea.

07:48.878 --> 07:49.878
Come.

07:49.912 --> 07:52.581
Where are we going?

07:52.615 --> 07:53.615
Just trust me, come.

08:00.456 --> 08:02.824
So this is the brand-new
music hall in Reykjavik.

08:02.859 --> 08:04.893
- Who's that?
- Uh, that's Hallfridur.

08:04.927 --> 08:06.495
She worked at this coffee shop

08:06.529 --> 08:07.562
that I spent a lot of time at.

08:07.597 --> 08:09.331
Oh, so you made some friends.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.765
Uh, yeah. A few.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.534
- Huh.
- Oh, and this is a waterfall

08:12.568 --> 08:14.469
I found just while I was driving.

08:14.504 --> 08:16.671
<i>Toby: It's like one
beautiful thing after another.</i>

08:16.706 --> 08:19.574
And not another human being
for miles in any direction.

08:20.676 --> 08:22.444
Sounds kinda lonely.

08:22.478 --> 08:23.578
It wasn't.

08:23.613 --> 08:24.913
Or it was, but in a good way.

08:24.947 --> 08:26.481
I mean,

08:26.516 --> 08:28.683
after all the stuff with Nikki...

08:28.718 --> 08:30.552
Um,

08:30.586 --> 08:32.654
just kinda felt like I found myself again.

08:32.688 --> 08:33.722
That's great, honey.

08:33.756 --> 08:35.924
Maybe I need to go to Iceland.

08:35.957 --> 08:37.392
<i>(Kathryn chuckles softly)</i>

08:37.426 --> 08:39.561
Oh, this.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.763
This was the most unbelievable night.

08:41.797 --> 08:43.597
So all these tour groups
go out to try to find

08:43.633 --> 08:44.766
<i>the northern lights.</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:47.402
I went out by myself,
couldn't find anything.

08:47.436 --> 08:48.570
And I'm on my way back,

08:48.604 --> 08:49.804
see this bus on the side of the road,

08:49.839 --> 08:51.773
ask the guy, "hey, you looking
for the northern lights?"

08:51.807 --> 08:53.742
He says, "look up." And...

08:55.478 --> 08:56.545
<i>(Upbeat music playing)</i>

08:56.579 --> 08:57.546
(Gasps)

08:57.580 --> 08:58.680
You made a video?

08:58.714 --> 08:59.881
That's amazing.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.616
It's actually time lapsed.

09:01.651 --> 09:03.585
It's a lot slower in real life,

09:03.619 --> 09:04.853
but even more beautiful.

09:04.887 --> 09:06.454
Look at that green.

09:06.489 --> 09:08.557
Viking legend is that
the lights were valkyries,

09:08.591 --> 09:10.592
<i>these virgin goddesses that would</i>

09:10.626 --> 09:12.661
take the spirits of the
fallen warriors up to heaven.

09:12.695 --> 09:14.663
So are the valkyries responsible

09:14.697 --> 09:18.600
for this weird techno-pop
we're listening to right now?

09:18.634 --> 09:20.602
Uh, actually, I put that together.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.605
Oh.

09:23.639 --> 09:24.773
Wait, that's you?

09:24.807 --> 09:26.775
Yeah, there's this whole
DJ scene over there.

09:26.809 --> 09:28.810
You know, I tried it one night,

09:28.844 --> 09:30.579
<i>and it was so much fun.</i>

09:30.613 --> 09:32.447
Country kinda opened me up.

09:32.481 --> 09:33.448
<i>(Music stops)</i>

09:33.482 --> 09:35.684
So, how's the stuff with you?

09:35.718 --> 09:36.851
I mean, with your hand.

09:36.886 --> 09:39.454
Oh, uh... heh.

09:39.488 --> 09:40.589
Never better.

09:41.824 --> 09:43.425
I actually need to get started

09:43.459 --> 09:44.426
on this English lit thing,

09:44.460 --> 09:45.694
- so, uh...
- Oh, yeah yeah.

09:45.728 --> 09:47.495
- Go, honey.
- Thank you.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.700
<i>(Knocks on door)</i>

10:01.811 --> 10:03.778
Okay, what's up?

10:06.682 --> 10:08.650
I didn't get into Pratt.

10:09.852 --> 10:10.885
What?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.687
How is that even possible?

10:12.722 --> 10:16.625
Apparently I'm unexceptional.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.493
(Sighs)

10:18.527 --> 10:20.595
That's crazy.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.600
Did you tell mom and dad?

10:28.471 --> 10:29.838
I just got the letter.

10:29.872 --> 10:31.539
They sent the e-mail on Monday

10:31.574 --> 10:32.741
and it went to spam,

10:32.775 --> 10:33.808
so, you know,

10:33.843 --> 10:35.543
my whole world ended four days ago,

10:35.578 --> 10:37.479
and I didn't even know it.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.781
Bay, your world did not end.

10:39.815 --> 10:41.650
It was one place.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.951
They don't get to say what you are.

10:42.985 --> 10:44.552
The only person that gets to say that

10:44.587 --> 10:45.687
you're an artist is you.

10:45.721 --> 10:49.424
I'll be sure to put that on my job
application at the Coffee Palace.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.659
Oh, come on.

10:50.693 --> 10:53.495
Where's your valkyrie spirit?

10:53.529 --> 10:54.496
Hey.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.565
You need to get angry.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.967
You need to prove to
them that they're wrong.

10:59.001 --> 10:59.968
Don't you think they're wrong?

11:00.002 --> 11:01.836
(Quietly) I don't know.

11:01.871 --> 11:04.472
<i>Of course they're wrong! Pratt sucks!</i>

11:04.507 --> 11:06.474
Pratt needs to feel the
wrath of hammer girl.

11:06.509 --> 11:07.475
You with me?

11:07.510 --> 11:08.910
(Weakly) Grr.

11:08.944 --> 11:11.446
Well, that's a start.

11:13.416 --> 11:14.649
(Snaps fingers) Come on.

11:14.684 --> 11:15.884
Get up.

11:15.918 --> 11:17.719
"Come on," what?

11:17.753 --> 11:20.622
We are gonna do some street art.

11:20.656 --> 11:24.626
Okay, I'm glad that
Iceland was great for you,

11:24.660 --> 11:26.728
and maybe if I went there,
I'd feel that way too,

11:26.762 --> 11:28.930
- but...
- Bay, you don't have Iceland.

11:28.964 --> 11:31.666
You have hammer girl.

11:31.701 --> 11:32.634
And me.

11:36.517 --> 11:38.183
Welcome to my restaurant.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.371
_

11:47.393 --> 11:49.361
Is all of this new?

11:51.330 --> 11:54.232
You're the first one to cook here.

11:54.267 --> 11:56.067
Ohh.

11:56.102 --> 11:59.137
It's like walking on fresh snow.

11:59.172 --> 12:00.338
I know.

12:02.208 --> 12:05.277
I guess I could take a little study break.

12:05.311 --> 12:08.013
But, uh, what should we make?

12:08.047 --> 12:10.582
Every summer growing up my whole family

12:10.616 --> 12:14.019
used to go to this little
village in Brittany.

12:14.053 --> 12:17.088
There's this house on the beach.

12:17.123 --> 12:19.024
Must be in my family for...

12:19.058 --> 12:21.226
how do you sign "generations"?

12:24.497 --> 12:26.164
So, every Sunday

12:26.199 --> 12:29.568
my grandmother used to
make this lemon cake...

12:32.104 --> 12:35.507
It was like a little slice of heaven.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.509
I got her to tell me the recipe,

12:37.543 --> 12:41.179
but every time I make it, it's...

12:42.315 --> 12:43.548
Paradise lost.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.518
Nice.

12:46.612 --> 12:48.647
Maybe it's the flour.

12:48.681 --> 12:50.248
It's different over there.

12:50.283 --> 12:54.152
No, I ordered the flour. Even
got the best French butter.

12:54.186 --> 12:56.454
Something else.

12:56.489 --> 13:00.225
Well, we have enough for five cakes?

13:00.259 --> 13:02.460
- I think so.
- Good.

13:02.495 --> 13:05.263
We'll keep track of all
the different variations.

13:05.298 --> 13:06.531
Can you take notes?

13:06.565 --> 13:08.266
<i>I am your sous-chef.</i>

13:09.435 --> 13:12.103
This is gonna be fun.

13:12.138 --> 13:16.074
And then after, it's back to the book hunt.

13:16.108 --> 13:18.109
Definitely.

13:22.248 --> 13:24.215
Stop what you're doing. I have a new idea.

13:25.551 --> 13:27.152
- Uh, okay.
- Okay.

13:27.186 --> 13:28.486
So that whole thing you
said about the valkyries

13:28.521 --> 13:29.654
taking the warriors up to heaven...

13:29.689 --> 13:31.623
those amazing lights...
well, that's exactly

13:31.657 --> 13:34.392
what were gonna do with this.

13:34.427 --> 13:36.394
Mom's old snow projector?

13:36.429 --> 13:38.296
We're gonna cut out some wave patterns

13:38.331 --> 13:40.265
to put over the lenses,
and then we're gonna drizzle

13:40.299 --> 13:42.567
stained glass paint onto the plexiglas.

13:42.601 --> 13:45.537
(Gasps) Oh, or maybe colored cellophane.

13:45.571 --> 13:48.139
I don't know yet. Anyway,
we're gonna turn on the lights,

13:48.174 --> 13:50.141
and then the shapes are
gonna create this, like,

13:50.176 --> 13:52.177
moving, dancing light pattern.

13:52.211 --> 13:53.411
The northern lights.

13:53.446 --> 13:54.512
Bringing the magic back home.

13:54.547 --> 13:56.181
I'm in!

13:56.215 --> 13:57.449
Great. Okay. You cut you some shapes,

13:57.483 --> 13:59.351
I will sketch them.

13:59.385 --> 14:01.553
Hey, you guys.

14:01.587 --> 14:03.555
Dad's bringing out the karaoke machine,

14:03.589 --> 14:06.191
so...

14:09.195 --> 14:11.096
Uh, what's going on?

14:11.130 --> 14:13.198
<i>Uh...</i>

14:13.232 --> 14:16.067
We were just seeing if
this old thing still worked.

14:16.102 --> 14:17.469
My snow projector?

14:17.503 --> 14:20.338
Yeah, you know, to...
to go along with my...

14:20.373 --> 14:21.639
"Weird techno music."

14:21.674 --> 14:24.576
(Mimics techno music)

14:24.610 --> 14:26.277
It's not for him, it's for me.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.415
I'm doing an art piece.

14:30.449 --> 14:32.617
And it kinda might be borderline illegal,

14:32.651 --> 14:34.452
- but it is gonna be totally beautiful.
- (Sighs)

14:34.487 --> 14:36.287
And nothing's gonna get damaged,

14:36.322 --> 14:37.655
and I promise we will be safe.

14:41.227 --> 14:45.196
I'm gonna have to tell your dad that...

14:46.332 --> 14:48.433
We're all going for ice cream.

14:48.467 --> 14:51.236
"We"?

14:51.270 --> 14:53.138
Do you know how many fundraisers

14:53.172 --> 14:54.606
I organize to support the arts?

14:54.640 --> 14:57.442
This is way more fun.

14:57.476 --> 14:59.411
I'll drive. Shh.

15:01.447 --> 15:03.381
Gotta love the new Kathryn Kennish.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.217
Damn, she beat us.

15:09.251 --> 15:11.252
<i>- (Patrons chattering)
- (Soft piano music playing)</i>

15:11.287 --> 15:13.221
How do I look?

15:13.255 --> 15:14.356
Ready for battle.

15:14.390 --> 15:16.224
Oh, wait, hold on.

15:19.228 --> 15:20.295
Thanks.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.235
Tammy, great to see you.

15:27.269 --> 15:28.436
Finally figured out I had to get here

15:28.471 --> 15:30.271
20 minutes early if I was gonna beat you.

15:30.306 --> 15:32.006
Ha, you're on to me.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.441
Regina Vasquez, Tammy Brenawicz,

15:33.476 --> 15:35.176
fourth district city council.

15:35.211 --> 15:37.145
It's an honor to meet you, Councilwoman.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.546
Oh, Tammy, please.

15:38.581 --> 15:41.015
<i>I hope you don't mind, but I invited</i>

15:41.050 --> 15:42.350
a new member of the chamber of commerce,

15:42.385 --> 15:45.553
and he's got a great deal
of interest in your project.

15:47.256 --> 15:49.524
Chip Coto. Great to meet you.

15:52.361 --> 15:53.495
And you.

15:53.529 --> 15:55.597
I wish you'd warn me
about your partner, Wes.

15:55.631 --> 15:57.265
She's a stunner.

15:59.135 --> 16:00.301
She's my secret weapon.

16:00.336 --> 16:01.369
Ha...

16:01.404 --> 16:03.171
Sit, please.

16:03.205 --> 16:05.373
Oh.

16:05.408 --> 16:07.275
Thank you.

16:15.844 --> 16:16.910
So, by the end of summer, Thursdays
had become like a support group

16:16.945 --> 16:19.380
for all the moms that
were trying to move up.

16:19.414 --> 16:20.781
I would do hair for job interviews,

16:20.815 --> 16:22.383
Anjelica would do resumes.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.917
I always say you can't keep a latina down.

16:23.952 --> 16:26.954
You see, that is what I
love about East Riverside.

16:26.988 --> 16:29.456
That fighting spirit,
everybody coming together.

16:29.491 --> 16:31.692
And that's what we wanna
preserve as we move forward.

16:31.726 --> 16:34.395
Working with local government
to protect low-income housing.

16:34.429 --> 16:36.563
We love cooperation.
That's why I came to Tammy,

16:36.598 --> 16:38.532
to forge alliances with businesses that

16:38.566 --> 16:40.434
love progress as much as we do.

16:40.468 --> 16:42.703
You've been working with Cutler
Construction in Denver, is that right?

16:42.737 --> 16:44.872
<i>- Past few projects, yeah.
- Think about this.</i>

16:44.906 --> 16:47.941
65% of all commercial development in K.C.

16:47.976 --> 16:49.710
This year alone.

16:49.744 --> 16:51.845
<i>That's what Frontier
Construction's done with us.</i>

16:51.880 --> 16:53.714
You know what you get
with that kind of volume?

16:53.748 --> 16:54.715
Ease.

16:54.749 --> 16:56.717
They know us, we know them.

16:56.751 --> 16:59.386
Gets all that paperwork
right to the top of the pile.

16:59.421 --> 17:00.554
Doors open on command.

17:02.757 --> 17:04.458
Actually, I'm sorry.

17:04.492 --> 17:08.494
I think I left my phone in your car.

17:08.530 --> 17:10.396
Sorry, I need to keep
in touch with my family.

17:10.432 --> 17:11.932
Of course.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.767
- There you go.
- (Exhales)

17:13.801 --> 17:15.669
Actually, can you come with?

17:15.704 --> 17:17.404
I don't wanna set off that alarm again.

17:18.906 --> 17:21.474
Sure. Excuse us.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.410
(Mouths)

17:23.444 --> 17:24.712
(Clears throat)

17:28.783 --> 17:30.884
Hey, what is going on?

17:30.919 --> 17:32.653
I'm sorry to pull the ripcord,

17:32.687 --> 17:34.621
but that chamber of commerce guy...

17:34.656 --> 17:36.657
my daughter worked with
him at the Senate office.

17:36.691 --> 17:39.493
She found out he was
sleeping with his intern.

17:40.829 --> 17:41.929
And?

17:41.963 --> 17:43.664
And...

17:43.698 --> 17:45.899
She kind of got him fired.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.735
(Exhales) Wait, what?

17:47.769 --> 17:50.504
Technically he resigned.

17:50.538 --> 17:52.406
After she blackmailed him.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.408
(Sighs) Are you kidding me?

17:54.442 --> 17:55.909
The guy is a total sleaze.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.377
And I don't know what
he's trying to pull with

17:57.412 --> 17:58.679
this whole construction company thing.

17:58.713 --> 18:01.448
He looking for a kickback and so is Tammy.

18:01.483 --> 18:02.549
That's what I thought.

18:02.584 --> 18:03.650
We gotta get out of this.

18:03.685 --> 18:05.686
Not if we want our project to happen.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.854
But that's illegal.

18:06.888 --> 18:09.723
It's how things get done, Regina.

18:11.392 --> 18:12.926
<i>Do you think that he recognized you?</i>

18:12.961 --> 18:14.394
I don't think so.

18:14.429 --> 18:16.630
Okay. Good.

18:16.664 --> 18:18.565
Wait, what are you gonna do?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.367
You gonna go back in
there and close this deal?

18:20.401 --> 18:21.602
Do you wanna take a stand

18:21.636 --> 18:23.470
or do you wanna make things
better for East Riverside?

18:23.505 --> 18:25.606
I want things to be legal.

18:25.640 --> 18:28.642
Well, that's a gray area.

18:28.676 --> 18:30.811
If certain things aren't said out loud,

18:30.845 --> 18:32.546
technically we're okay.

18:32.580 --> 18:35.582
If that's what you need to tell yourself.

18:35.617 --> 18:37.584
(Sighs)

18:48.963 --> 18:50.931
Ooh, hot hot hot hot hot.

18:50.965 --> 18:52.633
Looks good.

18:52.667 --> 18:53.834
This one's ready.

18:55.870 --> 18:57.771
So, uh...

18:57.806 --> 19:00.541
Nana put pine nuts on top, like flowers.

19:00.575 --> 19:02.576
Aww.

19:02.610 --> 19:05.379
Get to it.

19:05.413 --> 19:06.413
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

19:06.447 --> 19:08.415
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

19:09.784 --> 19:10.751
What was she like?

19:10.785 --> 19:12.586
Nana?

19:13.688 --> 19:15.689
Little French widow, this high,

19:15.723 --> 19:18.559
dressed in black, but crazy.

19:18.593 --> 19:19.893
- (Laughs)
- She used to ride around

19:19.928 --> 19:21.795
in a scooter, and yell at all the nuns

19:21.830 --> 19:23.497
if they were in her way.

19:23.531 --> 19:25.599
<i>"Allez, allez les vieilles,
on dégage, on dégage !"</i>

19:25.633 --> 19:28.702
(Both laugh)

19:28.736 --> 19:30.771
I'd love to see it someday.

19:30.805 --> 19:32.606
I've never been out of the country.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.874
No?

19:35.443 --> 19:37.411
We go. Next summer.

19:37.445 --> 19:38.478
All of us.

19:38.513 --> 19:39.880
Yeah?

20:06.941 --> 20:08.842
What is it?

20:08.877 --> 20:12.512
It's my grandmother's cake.

20:12.547 --> 20:13.513
Really?

20:13.548 --> 20:15.883
Oh, my God, you... you did it.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.651
It's like a time machine.

20:17.685 --> 20:19.453
Yes!

20:19.487 --> 20:20.654
Which one is that?

20:20.722 --> 20:23.490
Oh.

20:24.692 --> 20:26.860
Um...

20:26.895 --> 20:28.829
Wait, maybe...

20:28.863 --> 20:30.664
Maybe this one. I'm not sure.

20:30.698 --> 20:32.666
(Laughs)

20:32.700 --> 20:35.435
Angelo, you were supposed
to be taking notes!

20:35.470 --> 20:36.837
Well, this is not my talent.

20:36.871 --> 20:38.505
You are the science one.

20:38.539 --> 20:40.941
- You agreed...
- Look...

20:40.975 --> 20:43.577
The point of all this...

20:43.611 --> 20:46.546
when you are not thinking about it,

20:46.581 --> 20:48.682
you totally got it. Right?

20:50.018 --> 20:52.886
Stop trying to make this about the S.A.T.

20:52.921 --> 20:55.455
and give me some of that cake.

20:56.925 --> 20:58.492
You're gonna do great on this test.

21:00.461 --> 21:02.729
Just let go and swing.

21:03.831 --> 21:05.799
<i>- Mm.
- (Cell phone ringing)</i>

21:09.771 --> 21:10.737
I have to take this.

21:14.509 --> 21:16.877
Hey, Christy...

21:16.911 --> 21:18.578
<i>(Door closes)</i>

21:45.540 --> 21:46.606
Wait, did you get the gobos?

21:46.641 --> 21:48.809
Yeah, they're in the trunk.

21:48.843 --> 21:50.844
Okay, you guys get started.
I'll sweep the perimeter.

21:50.878 --> 21:52.579
- Okay?
- Check.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.881
Text us if you see any five-O.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.784
I thought we were doing street slang.

21:57.819 --> 21:59.419
Can you scope out a power source?

21:59.454 --> 22:00.854
I got like 100 feet of cord in here.

22:00.888 --> 22:02.856
Okay. Look for the five-O,

22:02.890 --> 22:03.957
<i>scope out the juice.</i>

22:03.992 --> 22:06.393
I can't wait to tell Renzo about this.

22:06.427 --> 22:08.428
Why are we so worried about cops?

22:08.463 --> 22:09.629
It's not like we're doing anything wrong.

22:09.664 --> 22:11.932
Uh, unless you count trespassing.

22:11.966 --> 22:13.767
You could pick a place a
little bit more under the radar?

22:13.801 --> 22:15.635
That's the point. It's an art center.

22:15.670 --> 22:16.837
<i>Showing the established powers-that-be</i>

22:16.871 --> 22:18.739
that I will not be defeated or excluded.

22:18.773 --> 22:20.807
- I am a valkyrie!
- Great, so, if we

22:20.842 --> 22:23.510
run into any security,
we'll just vanquish them.

22:23.544 --> 22:24.811
Or call dad.

22:27.548 --> 22:30.884
There you are, my beautiful blank canvas.

22:30.918 --> 22:34.454
You know, it really is a
bummer about you and Tank.

22:34.489 --> 22:36.556
I recommend international travel.

22:36.591 --> 22:38.759
I, uh, actually already...

22:38.793 --> 22:40.660
got back together with Emmett.

22:40.695 --> 22:43.730
The whole thing was kind of a mess.

22:43.765 --> 22:45.932
Uh, go ahead and judge.

22:45.967 --> 22:49.636
No, as long as there's not a
lifetime commitment involved,

22:49.670 --> 22:50.937
I think you're doing all right.

22:50.972 --> 22:53.640
Ah, I appreciate that. Hold this.

22:53.708 --> 22:54.875
Hey, guys, I found it!

22:54.909 --> 22:57.577
(Sighing) Way to be low-key, mom.

22:57.612 --> 22:59.479
There's an electric
vehicle charging station

22:59.514 --> 23:00.614
right around the corner.

23:00.648 --> 23:02.582
Sweet.

23:02.617 --> 23:03.817
Shh.

23:06.821 --> 23:07.888
Kathryn: You ready?

23:07.922 --> 23:10.490
Bay's first showcase at the Kauffman.

23:10.525 --> 23:12.492
All right, shall we count it off?

23:12.560 --> 23:13.527
On three.

23:13.561 --> 23:15.729
All: One, two, three.

23:15.763 --> 23:18.765
Let there be light!

23:18.800 --> 23:19.900
(Gasps)

23:23.771 --> 23:26.740
- Kathryn: Ah.
- Toby: Uh-oh.

23:26.974 --> 23:29.543
Well, this has been great.

23:29.577 --> 23:30.744
We'll get those contracts over,

23:30.778 --> 23:33.413
and you and Frontier can get started.

23:34.849 --> 23:36.650
You know, I think I'm
gonna stick with my company.

23:36.684 --> 23:37.684
They've been good to me.

23:37.718 --> 23:39.786
We'd love to meet with them.

23:39.821 --> 23:40.821
See what we can work out.

23:41.856 --> 23:43.523
That won't be necessary.

23:44.859 --> 23:45.959
We're sorry to hear that.

23:45.993 --> 23:48.895
You know, I understand there's been some

23:48.930 --> 23:50.897
community tension about this project...

23:50.932 --> 23:52.866
acts of vandalism, threats of violence?

23:52.900 --> 23:55.969
A few minor incidents,
nothing we can't handle.

23:56.003 --> 23:58.438
Volatile situation like that,

23:58.473 --> 23:59.539
you never know what can happen.

23:59.574 --> 24:02.576
I'd hate to see you guys
get hung up in delays.

24:02.610 --> 24:05.679
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.

24:07.515 --> 24:09.683
Thanks very much for your time, guys.

24:10.885 --> 24:12.552
Tammy: I'll keep in touch.

24:16.891 --> 24:18.725
Keep him away from your interns.

24:30.471 --> 24:32.405
So...

24:32.440 --> 24:33.907
Maybe we could try the country club.

24:33.941 --> 24:35.542
There's that wall by the tennis courts.

24:35.576 --> 24:37.544
Oh, dad's got a generator at the car wash.

24:37.578 --> 24:39.446
- I'll go grab it.
- Guys, it's not happening.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.448
The piece failed; It's over.

24:41.482 --> 24:43.450
You were so excited.

24:43.484 --> 24:45.418
Honey, don't give up
because of one setback.

24:45.453 --> 24:47.554
It's... it's all part
of the creative process.

24:47.588 --> 24:48.555
I'm sorry, mom,

24:48.589 --> 24:49.756
but when did you become such an expert

24:49.790 --> 24:51.458
on the creative process?

24:51.492 --> 24:54.895
Well, maybe writing isn't
the same as visual arts...

24:54.929 --> 24:57.497
Mom, you're not a writer, not a real one.

24:57.532 --> 24:58.632
Bay.

25:00.635 --> 25:01.902
I see.

25:01.936 --> 25:03.803
Good luck with your project.

25:03.838 --> 25:05.906
Mom, I...

25:05.940 --> 25:07.741
Nice.

25:15.595 --> 25:16.474
Mom, wait!

25:17.098 --> 25:18.866
I don't care if you're upset

25:18.900 --> 25:20.167
about your art piece, you have no right

25:20.201 --> 25:22.770
- to talk to me like that.
- I know, I know.

25:22.804 --> 25:24.838
And you know what? Excuse me.

25:24.873 --> 25:26.273
<i>I am a writer.</i>

25:26.308 --> 25:29.176
I have one book published
and another one...

25:29.210 --> 25:31.278
what am I even defending myself to you?!

25:31.313 --> 25:32.846
I'm sorry.

25:34.082 --> 25:35.749
This isn't about the art piece.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.785
What is it then?

25:40.121 --> 25:42.990
Uh, guys, I think we have a
little bit of a situation here.

(Siren blares)

25:53.134 --> 25:55.202
<i>(Car door opens)</i>

25:58.139 --> 26:00.107
All we said is that we didn't wanna use

26:00.141 --> 26:02.076
their construction company.

26:02.110 --> 26:04.044
How screwed are we?

26:04.079 --> 26:06.046
We made it pretty clear he
doesn't wanna be our friend.

26:06.081 --> 26:08.015
You think it's because he recognized me?

26:08.049 --> 26:10.017
It wouldn't have mattered if we
were willing to cut him a deal.

26:10.051 --> 26:11.785
- (Sighs)
- Like I said,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.087
it's how things get done.

26:13.121 --> 26:15.155
Why not this time?

26:17.192 --> 26:20.160
I didn't wanna lose your respect.

26:20.195 --> 26:21.996
Really?

26:22.030 --> 26:24.965
Plus, I don't need your teenage daughter

26:25.000 --> 26:27.067
- trying to blackmail me.
- (Laughs)

26:27.102 --> 26:29.069
Well, thank you

26:29.104 --> 26:31.872
for the crash course
in political corruption.

26:31.906 --> 26:33.874
My pleasure.

26:33.908 --> 26:36.176
Looks like we'll be taking the hard road.

26:36.211 --> 26:38.979

Sure.

30:15.155 --> 30:17.223
What does this mean?

30:23.263 --> 30:25.631
Um, this means...

Why?

30:31.472 --> 30:32.638

I guess she got in over her head.

30:44.618 --> 30:48.287
Isn't there something you can do?

30:48.322 --> 30:49.689
We foreclosed.

everything came together.

31:22.656 --> 31:25.158
But it fell apart.

31:25.192 --> 31:27.660
At least it brought us together.

31:30.564 --> 31:31.631
Yeah.

31:39.706 --> 31:41.440
(Gasps)

31:41.475 --> 31:44.544
Ah, I remember where I left my book!

31:44.578 --> 31:46.379
I had it with me when I went to K&D.

31:46.413 --> 31:47.480
We are back to the book?

31:47.514 --> 31:49.382
I know, I know. I need to let it go.

31:49.416 --> 31:51.584
- But...
- Listen, we can just call Regina.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.487
No, don't bother her. She's at that dinner.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.622
But I have a key.

31:59.259 --> 32:00.493
Do you mind?

32:00.527 --> 32:02.261
(Sighs)

32:02.296 --> 32:03.262
Of course not.

32:06.166 --> 32:07.133
Hang on.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.379
(Grunts, exhales)

32:52.212 --> 32:53.713
Well, that's the last of it.

32:53.747 --> 32:56.282
I'm sorry I ruined everyone's artistic buzz

32:56.316 --> 32:58.651
with my midas touch of failure.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.520
Hey, you don't have sole rights
to failure in this family.

33:01.555 --> 33:04.223
I have 18 rejected book proposals

33:04.258 --> 33:05.324
that I could show you.

33:05.359 --> 33:06.425
I've got a failed marriage,

33:06.460 --> 33:08.261
and I can't even legally drink yet.

33:08.295 --> 33:10.463
And you were waitlisted at Wash U.

33:10.497 --> 33:11.530
There's that.

33:11.565 --> 33:13.099
Plus, there was that gambling thing.

33:13.133 --> 33:14.100
That was bad.

33:14.134 --> 33:15.101
Thanks, mom.

33:15.135 --> 33:17.603
I feel so much better.

33:17.638 --> 33:19.105
We should go.

33:19.139 --> 33:21.207
No, let's just kinda wait a second.

33:21.241 --> 33:22.675
<i>(Car approaching)</i>

33:29.349 --> 33:31.284
I heard someone needed some power

33:31.318 --> 33:32.418
to light up her dreams.

33:33.487 --> 33:35.421
Generator is in the trunk.

33:35.455 --> 33:36.422
Nice going.

33:36.456 --> 33:38.291
- Thank you.
- Hey, honey.

33:38.325 --> 33:41.193
- Hey.
- Tell bay about a moment

33:41.228 --> 33:44.597
when your dreams were crushed,
but you survived anyway.

33:47.534 --> 33:49.335
Oh, yes.

33:49.369 --> 33:52.138
When I became a state senator,

33:52.172 --> 33:53.639
I thought that I would be useful.

33:53.674 --> 33:56.309
Instead of a barely-tolerated puppet

33:56.343 --> 33:57.376
for corporate interests.

33:58.445 --> 33:59.612
That was a good one.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.213
Happy to help.

34:02.349 --> 34:03.616
So are we doing this, or what?

34:05.152 --> 34:07.119
Come on, honey. Give it another shot.

34:10.389 --> 34:11.556
Sure.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.559
If security comes back,
let mom take the lead.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.504
(Laughing)

34:25.539 --> 34:27.139
It looks like she's working late.

34:28.475 --> 34:29.442
(Sighs)

34:30.476 --> 34:31.643
Alone?

34:31.678 --> 34:34.146
She promised not to do that.

34:34.181 --> 34:36.148
<i>(Cell phone ringing)</i>

34:38.518 --> 34:40.286
- It's Christy.
- Get it.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.288
I'll go in and tell mom
to come home with us.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.427
Christy.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.629
No, I understand.

34:50.664 --> 34:53.498
But this is not what we discussed.

- Mom!
- So sorry.

35:40.861 --> 35:42.696
You have a gun?!

35:42.730 --> 35:43.830
I didn't know it was you.

35:43.864 --> 35:45.632
- Are you okay?
- I called out!

35:45.666 --> 35:47.634
The water must have been
on, and then I called out.

35:47.668 --> 35:48.735
I'm deaf!

35:48.769 --> 35:50.036
Sweetie, I know!

35:51.706 --> 35:53.807
I wasn't expecting you. No one answered

35:53.841 --> 35:57.110
<i>- and I panicked.
- (Bell dings)</i>

35:57.144 --> 35:58.912
What's going on?

35:58.946 --> 36:00.580
What are you doing here?

36:00.615 --> 36:02.082
She came to get a book.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.017
Did something happen?

36:04.051 --> 36:05.719
I heard someone

36:05.753 --> 36:07.120
and I didn't know who it was.

36:07.154 --> 36:09.022
She pulled a gun.

36:09.056 --> 36:10.724
You what?

36:10.758 --> 36:12.892
I was terrified. I heard someone.

36:12.927 --> 36:14.894
Daphne, are you okay?

36:14.929 --> 36:17.030
<i>- Yeah.
- Look, I didn't...</i>

36:17.064 --> 36:18.999
Nothing happened.

36:19.033 --> 36:20.800
Where did you get a gun?

36:20.835 --> 36:22.636
It was something Wes thought I should have.

36:22.670 --> 36:24.638
- Wes?!
- To be safe.

36:24.672 --> 36:26.039
So you nearly shot our daughter?!

36:26.073 --> 36:27.173
You guys, stop. I'm fine.

36:27.208 --> 36:29.609
I thought she was an intruder.

36:29.644 --> 36:31.611
There was graffiti! I
did not hear her come in!

36:31.646 --> 36:32.712
That's it!

36:32.747 --> 36:35.048
This East Riverside project has to stop!

36:35.082 --> 36:37.050
This has nothing to do
with Wes or the project.

36:37.084 --> 36:38.852
I just overreacted.

36:38.886 --> 36:41.054
You're completely blind, you know that?

36:41.088 --> 36:43.156
All of this "We wanna save East Riverside."

36:43.190 --> 36:45.125
Just admit it! It's for him!

36:45.159 --> 36:47.961
What are you saying? That I'm cheating?

36:47.995 --> 36:48.962
Are you?

Are you kidding me?!

are the one that left us?</i>

36:55.069 --> 36:57.137
And then had a baby with another woman?!

36:59.173 --> 37:01.574
You couldn't raise that
one either, could you?

37:01.609 --> 37:02.609
Mom!

37:02.643 --> 37:04.811
I've given you everything I've got!

37:15.056 --> 37:16.623
Angelo, wait!

37:19.093 --> 37:21.695
Wait!

37:21.729 --> 37:22.862
Don't go.

I'm going to my apartment.
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:25.066 --> 37:27.867
I'm sorry for everything.

37:27.902 --> 37:30.837
It's not your fault. If
she wasn't so stubborn...

Ah.

39:21.649 --> 39:23.616
Well...
