My wife and her flying saucers.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.054
My husband and his indestructible head.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.890
Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.725
NORM: You're like a walking computer.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.352
What? I most certainly am not.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.733
-How long have you been married?
-ARTHUR: Why did you come here?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.109
Damn it, why?

Wanda?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.505
Yes, dear?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.175
Are you using your powers
to turn on the light?

01:31.258 --> 01:32.634
-(THUDDING)
-Yes, dear.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.469
Allow me, sweetheart.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.101
WANDA: What do you see?

01:42.269 --> 01:43.812
Only your lovely rose bushes.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.856
That's all?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.233
Are you using your night vision, Vision?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.485
I assure you, my love,
I see nothing amiss.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.821
You have absolutely
no reason to be frightened... (YELPS)

01:57.576 --> 01:58.744
You were saying?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.788
Actually, I did overhear
a couple of lads at work

02:01.872 --> 02:04.958
remarking on a few unsavory characters
settling in the neighborhood.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.003
Now, who knows
what those ne'er-do-wells might be up to?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
Robbing houses, vandalizing property.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.008
Walking through walls,
moving objects without touching them.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.637
Wanda, darling, you can't be suggesting
my colleagues were referring to us.

-(WANDA GASPS)

02:20.474 --> 02:23.644

Yes, one of us should.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.203
Well, I think we handled that well.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.413
Yes, I must say
I'm rather proud of myself.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.543
And look how you seized
on the opportunity to redecorate.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.212
-This is better, isn't it?
-Mmm.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.299

Darling, do all the other acts

04:20.135 --> 04:22.346
have such elaborate props?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.556
Are you kidding?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.225
Fred and Linda are building a moat

04:26.308 --> 04:29.144

Fear not, Glamour.

Yes, um, Wanda, you're not at all worried

05:09.768 --> 05:13.730
that the audience might just see
through this little charade?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.399
Well, that's the whole point.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.860
In a real magic act, everything is fake.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.532
Darling, the talent show fundraiser
is the most important event of the season

05:23.615 --> 05:26.410
and it's our neighborly duty
to participate.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.997
Plus, it's our chance to appear
as normal as possible while doing so.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.457
Well, I don't think
that should be a problem.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.710
This is our home now.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.213
I want us to fit in. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

05:38.922 --> 05:41.842
Oh, darling, we do. We shall.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.179

05:45.262 --> 05:49.474

the planning committee meeting.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.943

this town's security is up to snuff.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.079

a bit of friendly advice?

08:41.480 --> 08:43.190
Is it about the way how I'm dressed?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.234
Yes, but it's too late for that.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.446
Dottie is the key

a fresh coat of paint

09:39.121 --> 09:42.958
and will be installing the final
decorations all through the town square.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.918
And if you recognize
the antique footlights,

09:45.002 --> 09:47.129
it's because they're from my store.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.714
And the chairs?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.927
I'm sorry, Dottie.
I didn't ask about the chairs.

09:54.011 --> 09:57.973

chair any committees in the future.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.069

for Westview Elementary.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.196
This might help.

DOTTIE: In the eight years
since I founded our little club,

10:14.990 --> 10:18.243
this event has gotten
bigger and better every season.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.121
Say, those pants are peachy keen.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.748
Do you really think so?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.083
The other ladies are in skirts.
I was worried.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.169
We only have a few hours until show time,

10:27.252 --> 10:30.422
so a little less cross chatter
and a little more focus.

how often you rotate security patrols?

Do you interface directly
with local law enforcement?

such as burglary,

-No, Vision.
-I know these are indeed grave matters.

He doesn't eat food.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.837
Is gum food?

13:56.920 --> 13:59.548
Well, my understanding
is that it's purely for mastication.

It's really happening.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.640
(THUDDING)

27:20.599 --> 27:25.729
If it's that damn tree again,
I am going to rip it out by the roots!

27:33.070 --> 27:34.696
I don't see anything.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.126
What is that?

27:55.634 --> 27:57.219
Wanda.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.351
(BEES BUZZING)

28:11.942 --> 28:13.193
No.

28:22.202 --> 28:26.707
Vision... Is this really happening?

28:28.417 --> 28:29.877
Yes, my love.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.005
It's really happening.

28:46.268 --> 28:47.269
Vision...

29:08.832 --> 29:10.000
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

29:20.677 --> 29:23.889
MAN: (THROUGH RADIO) <i>Wanda?</i>
<i>Who's doing this to you, Wanda?</i>

29:24.598 --> 29:25.641
<i>Wanda?</i>
