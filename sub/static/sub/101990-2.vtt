My wife and her flying saucers.

00:09.426 --> 00:12.054
My husband and his indestructible head.

Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.725
NORM: You're like a walking computer.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.352

00:22.439 --> 00:24.733
-How long have you been married?
-ARTHUR: Why did you come here?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.109

Wanda?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.505
Yes, dear?

Are you using your powers

01:31.258 --> 01:32.634
-(THUDDING)
-Yes, dear.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.469
Allow me, sweetheart.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.101
WANDA: What do you see?

01:42.269 --> 01:43.812
Only your lovely rose bushes.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.856
That's all?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.233
Are you using your night vision, Vision?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.485
I assure you, my love,
I see nothing amiss.

You have absolutely
no reason to be frightened... (YELPS)

01:57.576 --> 01:58.744
You were saying?

01:59.536 --> 02:01.788
Actually, I did overhear
a couple of lads at work

02:01.872 --> 02:04.958
remarking on a few unsavory characters
settling in the neighborhood.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.003
Now, who knows
what those ne'er-do-wells might be up to?

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
Robbing houses, vandalizing property.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.008
Walking through walls,
moving objects without touching them.

02:13.091 --> 02:16.637

my colleagues were referring to us.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.644

Well, I think we handled that well.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.413
Yes, I must say
I'm rather proud of myself.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.543
And look how you seized
on the opportunity to redecorate.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.212
-This is better, isn't it?
-Mmm.

have such elaborate props?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.556
Are you kidding?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.225
Fred and Linda are building a moat

05:09.768 --> 05:13.730
that the audience might just see
through this little charade?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.399
Well, that's the whole point.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.860
In a real magic act, everything is fake.

Darling, the talent show fundraiser
is the most important event of the season

05:23.615 --> 05:26.410
and it's our neighborly duty
to participate.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.997
Plus, it's our chance to appear
as normal as possible while doing so.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.457

that should be a problem.

Is it about the way how I'm dressed?

decorations all through the town square.

And if you recognize
the antique footlights,

09:45.002 --> 09:47.129
it's because they're from my store.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.714
And the chairs?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.927
I'm sorry, Dottie.
I didn't ask about the chairs.

The other ladies are in skirts.
I was worried.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.169
We only have a few hours until show time,

is that it's purely for mastication.

It's really happening.

27:18.347 --> 27:19.640
(THUDDING)

27:20.599 --> 27:25.729
If it's that damn tree again,
I am going to rip it out by the roots!

27:33.070 --> 27:34.696
I don't see anything.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.126
What is that?

27:55.634 --> 27:57.219
Wanda.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.351
(BEES BUZZING)

28:11.942 --> 28:13.193
No.

28:22.202 --> 28:26.707
Vision... Is this really happening?

28:28.417 --> 28:29.877
Yes, my love.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.005
It's really happening.

28:46.268 --> 28:47.269
Vision...

29:08.832 --> 29:10.000
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

29:20.677 --> 29:23.889
MAN: (THROUGH RADIO) <i>Wanda?</i>
<i>Who's doing this to you, Wanda?</i>

29:24.598 --> 29:25.641
<i>Wanda?</i>
