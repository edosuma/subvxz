00:02.127 --> 00:03.544
Previously on Justified...

00:03.629 --> 00:04.754
Give me Drew,

00:04.838 --> 00:06.589
you can write your own ticket
to a better place.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.012
- You can't trust Colt.
- What are you saying?

00:13.097 --> 00:14.430
He never killed Ellen May.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.767
When I thought that the sheriff's department
picked her up, I went down to Shelby

00:17.851 --> 00:19.102
and I asked for his help, but she vanished.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.896
- What did you say?
- She's just gone, Boyd.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.066
No, about Shelby. What did you just say?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.567
I went to him and his deputies.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.320
We looked up the records,
but there's nothing on her.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.155
Shelby knew that Ellen May was alive?

00:31.240 --> 00:33.700
I guess my first step
would be to get right with the Lord.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.410
Something to do with Ava Crowder?

00:36.620 --> 00:38.037
Something you saw her do?

00:40.958 --> 00:42.959
- We're in this together.
- We are.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.794
But Delroy is on you.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.213
I should have killed her myself.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.799
Well, it may come to that yet. Go.

00:49.925 --> 00:52.301
So what now... Drew?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.221
Now I pull the ripcord for real.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.556
Shelby?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.308
Hello, Boyd.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.146
Drew goddamn Thompson.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.526
Bullshit.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.361
I was looking for Drew, same as you.

01:10.446 --> 01:14.031
The expression on your face
while we were cuffing you said otherwise.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.743
You holding me now
based on my facial expression?

01:16.827 --> 01:18.828
And I suppose we let you go,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.788
you just forget what you know

01:20.873 --> 01:22.957
and think about Shelby,
go home, and take a bath.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.043
Well, you wouldn't happen
to have any bath salts, would you?

01:26.128 --> 01:27.670
I'd get comfy if I were you.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.715
They're gonna put the word out
wide, start throwing up roadblocks.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.924
You know what your problem is, Raylan?

01:32.009 --> 01:34.635
Man's too smart to get snared that way,
but it could buy us some time.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.887
You should've been an outlaw.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.054
Any thoughts as to the women's clothing?

01:37.139 --> 01:39.348
This job has
too much paperwork for a man like you.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.768
- He was married.
- Too many rules and regulations.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.436
She left him 25 years ago.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.522
You should've been on
the other side with me and your daddy.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.152
You'd still be able
to shoot people and be an asshole.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.779
Your two favourite activities.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.156
Except you would be a rich asshole.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.492
More like dead or in jail.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.452
Well, I'm doing just fine.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
Yeah? How about Arlo?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.999
Well, I have been
meaning to get by and see your daddy.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.835
That's funny. I was just thinking

02:07.920 --> 02:11.088
you keep running your mouth,
I'd like to go ahead and arrange that.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.965
You gonna arrest me now for talking?

02:13.592 --> 02:15.092
Who said shit about arresting you?

02:17.179 --> 02:19.931
Excuse me, ma'am. These two gentlemen
are holding me against my will.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.265
Shut up.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.433
That was fast.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.352
Art didn't want to see you two left alone.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.895
He said that?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.480
- Where you at?
- Got nothing.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.691
We got roadblocks
and suspicious women's underwear.

02:30.776 --> 02:31.859
Like I said...

02:31.944 --> 02:34.612
So, if you're Shelby wanting to skip
town, what's your next move?

02:34.696 --> 02:35.780
We ain't looking for Shelby.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.782
We're looking for Drew Thompson.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.617
So...

02:41.161 --> 02:42.411
If you shot Theo Tonin

02:42.496 --> 02:45.540
and threw Waldo Truth
out of an aeroplane, what's your...

02:46.583 --> 02:47.667
What?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.926
The morning shift will start at 5:30.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.470
You should be safe here until then.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.850
Now, when Henderson comes in,
you tell him what you know.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.020
If it's enough for Boyd to want you dead,
it'll be enough to get you WitSec.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.022
Why can't I go with you?

03:10.107 --> 03:12.567
That's not one of the options.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.776
Well, that ain't an answer.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.322
Listen.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.284
You don't want to be part of what I got to do.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.329
What's the other option?

03:28.333 --> 03:29.959
You get on a bus.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.545
You ride until you reach a coast.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.922
Doesn't matter which one.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.925
You ask around till you can find
somebody to help you make a new ID.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.763
And you make a new life for yourself.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.348
Come on.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.562
Now, don't just
take it to Tennessee and then stop.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.356
Boyd will find you,
and he'll finish what he intended

03:53.233 --> 03:54.817
when I found you that night.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.572
Are you sure I can't just go with you?

04:01.158 --> 04:04.785
Look. I'm sorry it's got to be this way.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.245
I truly am.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.414
But it does.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.668
Good luck to you, Ellen May.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.961
But...

04:40.864 --> 04:42.698
Oh, balls.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.635
Hey.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.560
You come with me, we're never coming back.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.020
You understand?

05:15.065 --> 05:16.732
Well, where you going?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.067
Mexico, to start.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.195
Had a beach town in mind, but...

05:22.364 --> 05:26.409
Could be swayed
to the mountains, if you prefer.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.995
I ain't never seen the ocean before.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.373
Well, now's your chance.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.965
How long is it gonna take to get there?

05:41.758 --> 05:45.177
If we're lucky,
should be across the border before sun-up.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.638
How fast is this car?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.349
We ain't driving, Ellen May.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.101
I'm gonna fly us.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.137
Lived here pretty much my whole life,
I never seen the airport.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.847
It ain't much of one.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.141
Couple of hangars and an airstrip.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.143
You fly there a lot?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.063
When I first moved here, I avoided it.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.481
Had to keep that part of my life hidden.

06:38.982 --> 06:43.152
But lately,
I've had opportunity to renew my skills.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.906
- Is that it?
- Yep.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.783
Where do we go in?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.993
Up there at the second gate.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.287
- The one by the light?
- What?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.372
The light there on that building?

06:55.499 --> 06:56.749
- Go past.
- Why?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.084
Don't slow down. Just keep going past.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.886
Roger that. Passed on.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.387
Lookout said the driver was a woman.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.389
That's seven in the last hour.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.558
There's other airstrips, you know.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.310
Not within 100 miles, there ain't.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.480
Well, some of them mountains,
they blew the tops off, they're flat as a dime.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.606
You could land a plane on them.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.442
Doesn't make much sense, does it,
since the Sheriff's plane's already here.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.653
UPS was gonna put
a distribution centre up there,

07:25.737 --> 07:27.488
- but the roads are too bad.
- What?

07:27.572 --> 07:28.656
UPS was gonna put a...

07:28.740 --> 07:29.949
Not you.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.618
- The Sheriff's got a plane here?
- Well, yeah.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.124
Up in hangar 2.
Shelby used to take it up every couple weeks.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.210
We came here, talked to you,

07:41.294 --> 07:44.296
went through all the records of everyone
who flew in and out of this airport,

07:44.381 --> 07:46.298
and you didn't say shit
about the Sheriff's plane!

07:46.383 --> 07:48.217
You were looking for a criminal.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.593
Why would I mention the Sheriff?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.178
Then why ain't he here?

07:51.263 --> 07:52.555
Sit down.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.265
Did you warn him?

07:54.349 --> 07:55.683
And why would I warn him?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.560
You know he's
a drug-smuggling murderer, right?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.478
I didn't do nothing! I swear!

08:01.189 --> 08:02.523
What about that light out there?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.483
Is that usually on this time of night?

08:04.693 --> 08:07.027
I don't know.
No one's ever usually here this time of night!

08:10.866 --> 08:12.741
We got a roadblock at Crestland Pass?

08:13.785 --> 08:15.411
Crestland?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.704
There ain't no Crestland on this map.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.664
It ain't on the map. Give me a radio.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.545
It's warmer in here, you know.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.965
These marshals' coats
are surprisingly well-insulated.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.383
One of the perks of the job.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.885
Drier, too.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.385
They're also waterproof.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.431
They also give you special vision?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.100
Because if not,
I fail to see the odds of catching Drew being

08:38.184 --> 08:40.186
any better waiting out there than in here.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.854
Is that what Art told you?

08:41.938 --> 08:46.150
"Rachel, stay with Raylan.
Make sure he don't catch cold."

08:46.234 --> 08:47.693
Listen.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.239
I can deal with your aloofness.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.491
It's annoying, but I let it slide

08:54.576 --> 08:56.827
because you get your job done
and you're easy on the eyes.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.830
I can even deal with the fact
that if you catch Drew Thompson,

08:59.915 --> 09:01.665
you might even be my boss.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.751
But if you don't get in the car right now,

09:03.835 --> 09:06.337
I swear to God
I'm gonna start singing show tunes.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.297
Promise?

09:09.007 --> 09:11.008
Don't mess with me right now, Raylan.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.361
Evening, gentlemen.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.862
Thought you were
gonna meet us at the airport.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.198
Well, it took longer than I remembered.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.951
How the hell do you come
all the way down here every other damn day?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.411
I listen to a lot of books on tape and stay zen.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.540
Well, I hope you'll bear that in mind
when I tell you what I'm about to tell you.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.167
Are you gonna yell at me?

09:45.252 --> 09:46.877
What, over that Hunter Mosley fiasco?

09:47.545 --> 09:50.631
No, I'm gonna wait
and suspend you after we catch Drew.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.343
No, what I was about to tell you
is that the staties let Boyd Crowder go.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.761
When?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.137
About 20 minutes ago.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.764
Lawyer showed up with a court order.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.350
Well, I hope they broke
his cell phone in half before they let him go.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.102
I think you're the only person
who does stuff like that.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.688
If he calls Theo Tonin,
we got less time than we thought.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.940
Well, Drew's been in law enforcement.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.942
He knows that
when you run is when you get caught.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.277
He might stay put for a while.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.736
Any idea where he might go?

10:12.862 --> 10:16.198
He knows we're sitting
on his known associates, so...

10:18.201 --> 10:20.077
He had ladies' underwear.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.287
What?

10:21.371 --> 10:24.415
Not like ladies' underwear,
like whore's underwear.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.377
That... He's got Ellen May.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.753
That prostitute of Crowder's?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.630
Why he said something
to Boyd the other day.

10:31.715 --> 10:34.758
He's got Ellen May.
We find her, we find Drew.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.803
By the way, I have that same pair of panties.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.432
Where you going?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.018
- I'm gonna tell the staties.
- Oh, hell, no. Hell, no!

10:44.644 --> 10:46.395
Get back over here.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.566
First thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
acknowledge that this guy's awesome.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.817
What?

10:51.901 --> 10:56.572
I mean, he shoots Theo Tonin,
fakes his own death in a spectacular fashion,

10:56.656 --> 10:59.325
pushes a guy
out of an aeroplane while he's flying it,

10:59.409 --> 11:02.619
parachutes into Harlan County
with enough coke and cash

11:02.704 --> 11:05.080
to jump-start the economy of a small country,

11:05.165 --> 11:08.083
and then he has the balls
to get a job in law enforcement

11:08.168 --> 11:09.877
not once but two times.

11:09.961 --> 11:12.046
He spends
a couple of days riding around with you

11:12.130 --> 11:13.714
while you're looking for him,

11:13.798 --> 11:16.425
and now he's
run off with a hooker that's half his age.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.552
That's some bad-ass shit.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.430
- It's pretty bad-ass.
- Yes, it is.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.390
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.184
You gonna let those guys be the ones,

11:25.268 --> 11:27.728
or are we gonna
be the ones that take that badass?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.230
You're right.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.565
- We're on it.
- Yeah.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.858
Let's go find a whore.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.905
Well, shit!

11:38.782 --> 11:41.950
What if I drive through,
pick you up on the other side?

11:42.035 --> 11:46.538
No, the car ain't clean.
And Raylan could be up there.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.209
He'd recognise you
and put two and two together.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.711
So what do we do?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.758
We walk down there and turn ourselves in.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.885
I said I ain't gonna do that.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.763
Ellen May, flying out of here was plan A.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.474
Driving out through
the Crestland Pass was plan B.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.600
There ain't no plan C.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.603
I don't care, all right?
I ain't gonna rat on Ava.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.313
I don't want to testify, either.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.733
Live that life they're gonna give me,
always looking over my shoulder.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.694
And that's if I survive long enough to testify.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.488
But we got no play left.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.532
They're gonna be watching
everybody I know,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.742
everybody I ever did know.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.078
We got no place left to hide.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.001
I got an idea.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.087
Some good news.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.464
Best I can figure, Shelby's
still got Ellen May with him.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.341
But why? What good is she doing him?

12:39.426 --> 12:43.178
Well, it could be we get a call from Shelby,
him blackmailing us into protecting him.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.055
No. If he was gonna do that,
he would've already done it.

12:45.140 --> 12:49.393
Which makes it more likely he's using her
as conduit to a place to lie low.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.270
Staying with a friend of hers, you mean?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.482
Where would Ellen May go
if she was in trouble?

12:55.567 --> 12:58.819
Does she have any family
in Harlan, any friends?

12:58.903 --> 13:01.321
Father's in prison.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.576
Her mother ran away when she was little.
Could be dead, far as she knows.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.619
Nicky Cush, maybe?

13:08.163 --> 13:11.123
Nicky Cush?
The fella who ran Audrey's before Delroy?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.585
He's the one that brought her on.
They were really close, from what I heard.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.672
Had some kind of twisted
father/daughter thing going on.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
Well, he'll be the first on my list.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.468
How 'bout you, darling?
How you holding up?

13:23.470 --> 13:24.553
Food's good.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.638
I do envy you on that front.

13:27.432 --> 13:30.267
Boyd, I can't just sit here
while you're out there scrambling around.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.519
Ellen May is a bullet in a loaded gun.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.898
Now, it's best you stay
out of those sights and stay safe.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.108
I love you.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.776
I love you, too.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.530
- So?
- So, you need to figure out

13:43.615 --> 13:45.032
whose bed we got to drag Jimmy out of.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.450
I'm gonna need all hands on deck.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.494
I mean, what's the plan?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.787
The plan is for you
to find Jimmy and wake his ass up.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.388
So, you understand
the situation you've put me in?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.935
I'm gonna need you tonight, Colt.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.563
I need you to be
that M.P. I knew back in Kuwait.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.191
Do you still think you can be that man?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.949
Boyd, I'm gonna make this right.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.453
Jimmy'll be up front in five.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.497
Come on.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.832
Stay here and wait for my call.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.972
What's the name of
the place where we're going?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.474
It's called Huatulco.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.018
Huatulco.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.107
You ever been there before?

15:00.191 --> 15:02.526
It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.029
I like Mexican food.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.782
Me, too.

15:08.866 --> 15:13.745
Hey, they got religion in Mexico,
like churches and stuff?

15:13.830 --> 15:16.540
Sure. It's mostly Catholic.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.458
Anything like what Billy's church was?

15:18.543 --> 15:21.378
Well, it's a branch of Christianity,
if that's what you mean.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.718
Bet they give the sermons
in Spanish, though, huh?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.887
Yeah. But you'll learn.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.183
Thank you, Shelby.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.436
For what, making you a fugitive?

15:37.520 --> 15:38.770
No.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.024
For coming back for me.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.612
For looking out for me.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.868
Not that many people ever
cared enough to look out for me before.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.956
Look, I know we're on the run and all, but...

15:59.584 --> 16:01.710
I ain't never felt so free.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.637
Duffy? It's Crowder.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.972
Which one?

16:14.057 --> 16:17.309
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.982
I trust you have
earth-shattering news, Mr Crowder.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.152
We found Drew Thompson.
That shattering enough?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.033
And by "found," you mean?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.410
I mean it turns out
he's the goddamn county sheriff.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.996
That man Shelby?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.706
Doesn't he work for you?

16:39.791 --> 16:41.750
Under our noses the whole time.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.960
- So, where is he?
- No idea.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.755
Marshals and the state troopers
say they got a dragnet going.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.175
Boyd's out looking, too. So I figured
you'd send some guys down here.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.053
Send them where?
You just said you don't know where he is.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.013
So send them down here to look for him.

16:55.598 --> 16:58.475
My people know Harlan County about as
well as they know Juneau, Alaska.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.104
How are they supposed
to find Shelby before the marshals or Boyd?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.107
You want them to go door to door or post
fliers like he's a lost cat?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.193
So you're saying you got nobody in Harlan?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.613
Au contraire, Mr Crowder.
I do have a man in Harlan.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.781
You.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.660
So I got to find him on my own?

17:16.786 --> 17:21.790
It's called subcontracting, and it's how
business is done in the 21st century.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.960
Now, find Shelby before anyone else does,

17:25.044 --> 17:29.798
or you can say goodbye to that dream
you have of displacing your cousin.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.509
Do you understand?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.679
Yeah.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.973
I expect hourly updates.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.410
Sheriff.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.828
Mr Limehouse.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.497
I don't believe we've met.

18:02.582 --> 18:07.544
Mr Limehouse, my name is Ellen May,
and we come here for protection.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.004
Protection?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.298
Yeah, I got people trying to kill me.

18:11.382 --> 18:14.050
Now, how exactly you think this works, girl?

18:15.344 --> 18:18.513
My friend Trixie,
she used to always come up...

18:18.598 --> 18:20.974
Trixie had information for me.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.851
You got information for me?

18:24.479 --> 18:26.229
And what, your office ain't safe enough?

18:26.355 --> 18:28.023
Not right now, no.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.443
Listen, I know
we had our differences in the past.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.945
Yeah, like you
shooting down my cousin's boy

18:34.030 --> 18:35.363
in front that liquor store?

18:35.490 --> 18:38.575
But Ellen May ain't done nothing to you.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.619
And she can earn her keep.

18:40.703 --> 18:44.039
Yeah, well, I ain't in the whore business.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.832
'Course not.

18:45.917 --> 18:50.003
You're just a banker,
cuts meat all day and wants to be left alone.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.173
Now, you think that little,
old star on your chest

18:54.175 --> 18:57.719
and that gun
in your holster allows you to say

18:57.845 --> 19:02.390
whatever the hell you want up in my holler,
but you a damn fool, Shelby.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.559
You can ignore them both.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.229
And I know you're not gonna
extend any comfort to me,

19:08.064 --> 19:11.107
regardless of the offer,
but I know you need money.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.527
- Is that right?
- What are you doing?

19:14.362 --> 19:17.447
What those marshals took,
what you had hidden in them pigs,

19:17.573 --> 19:21.409
I figure you must owe some of your
depositors a shit load, plus interest.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.745
Well, you making a whole lot of assumptions.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.205
You can't just leave me here.

19:25.289 --> 19:29.668
You keep Ellen May safe and maybe get her
out of town in a couple of weeks,

19:29.752 --> 19:31.795
I got $15,000 for you.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.344
Two weeks.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.929
And you get her out of town.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.430
Don't push your luck.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.686
Now, Boyd won't come up here.
You'll be safe.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.521
Why can't you stay, too?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.565
I ain't welcome here.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.942
- But I'll be all right.
- Come on. Don't be silly.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.944
I need money, remember?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.153
$15,000's all I got.

20:03.286 --> 20:07.289
Yeah, well,
from what I hear, you worth plenty...

20:08.624 --> 20:09.749
Drew.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.296
Boys.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.839
Don't. No!

20:23.681 --> 20:27.267
Well, I never thought of Ellen May to be
one to start any trouble, you know?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.852
'Cause she never
had a thought of her own, you know?

20:28.978 --> 20:32.480
I mean, you just kind of put her
in the right direction and push.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.318
But why'd you say she left, again?

20:36.444 --> 20:38.653
I'm sure you remember I did not.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.282
But, well,
it's real important you find her, huh?

20:42.366 --> 20:45.201
We both know I wouldn't
be here otherwise, Nicky.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.204
Well, you know, it's been a long time, Boyd.

20:48.831 --> 20:52.500
I mean, it ain't like we're friends on
the Facebook or nothing, you know?

20:52.627 --> 20:53.668
I mean, shit.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.046
Well, you wouldn't find me
on one of them websites anyway, you know?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.297
I mean, did you know that...

20:57.381 --> 20:58.757
- Colt!
...the NSA's got all kinds of things...

20:58.841 --> 21:00.717
Whoa. No! Hold on! Hold on!

21:00.843 --> 21:04.220
Hold on, boys! Look, look, look.
I want to help you. I really do. I do.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.139
But look, can I confide in you, Boyd?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.850
All right,
look, Delroy didn't leave me with much.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.477
He took the whole business from me.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.024
I need some cash, is what I'm saying.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.359
Chair.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.028
Hey. Come on, now.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.321
This ain't necessary, Boyd.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.660
You got another battery?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.664
Boyd.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.673
You think he's trying to say something, Colt?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.466
I think he might be!

21:41.550 --> 21:43.385
I'm all ears, Mr Cush!

21:44.845 --> 21:46.888
Limehouse! Limehouse!

21:47.014 --> 21:49.766
Whenever she'd get in trouble,
she'd threaten to go to Limehouse!

21:58.025 --> 22:00.360
I know they're here.
Were you even gonna tell me?

22:00.444 --> 22:03.071
Well, I didn't know
I was obliged to keep you apprised

22:03.197 --> 22:05.949
of comings and goings in my holler.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.243
I told you this woman means me harm.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.828
You or Boyd?

22:09.912 --> 22:11.246
Me.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.915
Yeah. Well, you'd have said that either way.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.751
Do you want to see her?

22:32.935 --> 22:35.812
See, Ava? I been hiding this whole time!

22:35.938 --> 22:37.856
And I ain't said nothing!

22:37.940 --> 22:42.694
I know why you did what you needed to do
and why you thought you needed to do it.

22:42.778 --> 22:49.784
But even then,
I still didn't say nothing about nothing.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.370
Did Shelby drop you off?

22:52.455 --> 22:53.830
Shelby ain't left.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.123
- Go on, girl.
- But... Wait.

22:55.249 --> 22:56.624
Go on, now.

22:57.460 --> 23:01.463
Now, it didn't look to me
like she mean you no harm at all.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.927
How much for the both of them?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.221
$150,000.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.973
- For both of them?
- Each.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.143
Well, tell him we'll do it.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.188
Baby, that's gonna clean us out.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.190
Baby, just tell him.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.358
I'll see you soon.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.071
$500,000?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.239
You want your man,
that's what it's gonna cost.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.407
That's all, huh?

23:29.492 --> 23:31.826
That and
a rather large piece of the heroin trade.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.329
I don't think Theo's gonna go for that.

23:34.455 --> 23:38.208
I'm about to give you
Drew goddamn Thompson on a silver platter.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.710
You bet your
mama's wedding ring he'll go for it.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.213
Why don't we leave my mother out of this?

23:43.339 --> 23:45.507
And why don't
you call me when you got him?

23:49.011 --> 23:50.136
We good?

23:50.221 --> 23:53.223
There's no substitution
for a winning personality.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.101
I'm so tired of hearing
that goddamn girl's name.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.686
- Teri, sweetie.
- I'm prettier than her.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.773
I'm blond, and I can
do shit they ain't even thought up names for.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.900
Would you just stop,
please, for a minute, and think?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.945
Now, maybe you know
something you just don't know you know.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.363
What's that supposed to mean?

24:08.489 --> 24:11.574
It means to think about Ellen May, okay,
and the people that she would talk about.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.828
Maybe she has an aunt or someone
somewhere that she could count on.

24:14.912 --> 24:16.287
If she had somebody she could count on,

24:16.372 --> 24:19.249
I guess she wouldn't be sucking hillbilly
dicks for money, would she?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.212
Shit.

24:25.673 --> 24:26.714
Yo.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.800
Johnny?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.635
I thought I asked you to stay at the bar.

24:30.719 --> 24:34.097
Well, am working on a lead on Shelby.

24:34.223 --> 24:38.017
Why, no need, Cousin.
Both he and our lost sheep have been found.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.144
You found them?

24:39.228 --> 24:40.353
Well, how about this for irony?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.897
Seems they made a wrong turn,
fell into Ava's lap.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.524
They're at Noble's?

24:44.608 --> 24:48.361
Limehouse is gonna sell them to us.
It's gonna cost me everything I got.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.822
But we deliver Shelby to Theo Tonin,

24:50.906 --> 24:54.033
I have it on good authority
he will make it worth our while.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.619
Shit, Boyd. Limehouse? You can't trust him.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.371
I don't have a choice, Cousin.

24:59.540 --> 25:03.585
But if we get this right, we will be kings.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.920
Well, all right. I'm on my way.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.132
What's up, Johnny?

25:09.258 --> 25:10.842
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.635
I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Givens.

25:12.761 --> 25:13.845
This is Brooks.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.471
I think I seen you up here before.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.724
As much as I don't consider myself the type,

25:17.808 --> 25:20.977
I have become a frequenter
of this particular whorehouse.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.270
Hey, Teri, you step out?

25:22.396 --> 25:25.565
Actually, it's ladies of your
establishment we're looking to speak to.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.025
Figure maybe they could
help us find someone?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.736
Oh, my God. Not Ellen May again.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.363
So we're not the only ones, then?

25:32.448 --> 25:36.701
You're asking questions about Ellen May?
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.995
I'm sorry, Johnny.
What questions should we be asking?

25:41.665 --> 25:42.707
Honey, you can go.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.459
Whatever.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.592
Okay.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.803
Well, maybe what you should be asking is
where does Boyd keep all his money?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.307
You bust his ass for tax evasion.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.850
Saying you're gonna tell us?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.519
Sure. Why the hell not?

26:03.646 --> 26:06.522
Boyd doesn't give a damn about nothing.
Never did.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.275
When we was kids,
he'd build half a tree house,

26:09.360 --> 26:11.903
and then he'd run off and go build a go-kart.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.405
And then he'd forget them both
and spend the whole rest

26:14.490 --> 26:17.408
of the summer stealing candy
and trading it for cigarettes.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.576
I'll take your word for it.

26:18.661 --> 26:20.245
I just dug coal with the man.

26:20.329 --> 26:24.415
And he gets back from the war,
and he finds Jesus.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.542
And he receives
his ordination through the mail

26:26.669 --> 26:29.587
from one of them bible colleges down
in South Carolina or some shit,

26:29.672 --> 26:32.090
making us all learn
the ways of white supremacy,

26:32.174 --> 26:34.133
as it was laid down by the Lord almighty.

26:34.218 --> 26:37.971
Then he goes on and on
and on about white flight and all that shit.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.639
You know what that is?

26:39.723 --> 26:40.932
People moving out of town?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.977
White people moving to the suburbs.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.853
'Cause they want
to cut grass and have barbecues?

26:47.064 --> 26:48.523
Shit, no.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.068
'Cause they want to get away from black
people like you and all the greasers

26:52.194 --> 26:54.487
and the Asiatics
and all the goddamn Mexicans

26:54.571 --> 26:55.822
running around infecting the place.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.240
But, you know, these are Boyd's words.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.617
Johnny. What's your point?

26:59.702 --> 27:00.868
You know what he's doing now, Raylan?

27:01.704 --> 27:04.706
He's buying a house
in the goddamn suburbs!

27:05.541 --> 27:08.251
Up there on Clover Hill,
because the man is in love.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.919
You sound like he stole your girlfriend.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.587
No.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.924
He stole Raylan's girlfriend. He stole my job.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.219
But I did get this as a consolation prize

27:18.304 --> 27:20.596
for believing all of his bullshit.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.598
Thing is, Johnny,

27:22.725 --> 27:26.019
you didn't get cut in half
from Bo's shotgun 'cause of Boyd.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.438
You got shot
'cause that's the shit that happens

27:28.564 --> 27:31.316
when you choose
to live a life as a small-time asshole.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.695
Second, I'm guessing
if Boyd's getting close to Drew

27:35.779 --> 27:39.073
makes him a made man,
then you'll be spending the rest of your days

27:39.158 --> 27:40.325
playing second fiddle.

27:40.743 --> 27:43.953
Your problem is
we don't give a shit about Boyd.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.371
That's not why we're here.

27:45.456 --> 27:48.291
The man we're after, Drew Thompson.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.295
Now, you can help us with that,

27:53.088 --> 27:55.631
maybe we can do you a favour
in the process.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.235
Mr Crowder!

28:16.320 --> 28:19.781
How about we dispense
with the bullshit, get this thing done?

28:19.865 --> 28:22.533
See, now, I thought you'd come up here
with a little more gratitude,

28:22.618 --> 28:24.243
considering all the stuff I done for you.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.579
I got three different types
of people in my life.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.831
My friends, our friends, and her friends.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.625
You know which one you fall into?

28:31.293 --> 28:32.293
Well, I could guess.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.087
You ain't done shit for me.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.588
You done it for her.

28:35.672 --> 28:39.300
Now, you want what I got in this briefcase
or you want to waste some more of my time?

28:42.805 --> 28:46.182
And I believe I'll take
what I came for, be on my way.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.067
You ever been on a plane, Mr Crowder?

28:56.652 --> 28:59.862
Why? You plan on
taking flying lessons with my money?

28:59.988 --> 29:01.531
I've been having this dream.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.326
I dream that I'm flying this plane.
I mean one of them great, big, old suckers.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.536
A jumbo jet.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.039
And all the passengers
is folks from Noble's Holler.

29:11.041 --> 29:15.294
Damn near everybody I know
and care about's on this thing.

29:15.379 --> 29:19.507
I'm at the controls when all of a sudden,
something goes terribly wrong.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.593
Lights is flashing, buzzers sounding.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.013
And we start going down.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.725
And I'm fighting to keep it level,
and it ain't no use.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.522
And I always wake up
just before impact, sweating.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.817
While I believe I understand
your subtle metaphor,

29:37.901 --> 29:41.154
what I don't understand
is why you feel the need to tell me.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.448
Well,

29:44.616 --> 29:47.743
I'm telling you so you understand

29:49.037 --> 29:51.122
why I'm about to do what I'm about to do.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.416
Ellstin, we had a deal.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.584
- We did.
- Yeah.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.627
And now I'm changing it.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.924
Hell, that ain't enough money
to purchase no two lives.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.927
It'll get you one.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.930
And which 'un is up to you.

30:17.441 --> 30:22.153
Well, you mind
if I take a moment to confer with my lady?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.166
Ellen May.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.667
No.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.253
Ava, we can always make more money.
But if she turns on us...

30:39.338 --> 30:40.963
- She ain't gonna say anything.
- You don't know that!

30:41.048 --> 30:42.673
She hasn't so far.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.593
Ava, she's a wild animal,

30:45.677 --> 30:47.803
and if she gets cornered,
there's no telling what she'll do.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.642
Shelby's our future. We can't pass this up.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.352
There ain't no future for me without you.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.478
It's Ellen May.

30:56.313 --> 30:59.440
Then do this for me, for us.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.484
Please.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.247
Shelby.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.249
No. No, no. No, no.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.542
Girl. Girl, be quiet.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.211
Please. No, no, no, no! Please. Take me!

31:20.295 --> 31:22.797
He ain't done anything wrong!
He didn't do anything to you!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.966
Limehouse wouldn't
do no different than we would.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.259
No, you don't know that!

31:26.343 --> 31:28.219
Listen! You're gonna be safe...

31:29.513 --> 31:31.973
No! Get off.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.432
No.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.142
Girl. Come on, girl. Girl.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.728
It's okay. It's okay.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.022
It's my time. It's my time.

31:40.107 --> 31:44.235
The boys will take y'all
back down the hill to your car.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.529
When you get another 300 grand together,

31:46.613 --> 31:50.741
you give me a call.
We'll talk about getting your little ho back.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.041
Thank you.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.380
Hey.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.299
Come on.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.930
I jumped with too much cocaine.

32:13.015 --> 32:15.850
Came in hot, broke my legs.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.978
Never would've
stayed in Harlan if I had landed right.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.271
Well...

32:20.355 --> 32:23.065
Whole world would've been mine to explore.

32:23.150 --> 32:26.068
Well, I'd say you had
yourself a pretty good run, considering.

32:26.862 --> 32:29.071
Well, thanks to your daddy and Arlo.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.364
May they rest in peace.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.244
Are you saying Arlo Givens is dead?

32:35.746 --> 32:37.872
Shivved in prison.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.248
Figured you'd have heard by now.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.460
No, we had not.

32:45.881 --> 32:49.175
Poetic, I suppose,
as you'll soon be joining them in the afterlife.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.596
I'm sure the three of you
will have a lot to talk about.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.933
That cocaine I brought to Harlan,
that made your people, Boyd.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.354
Pulled them out of trailers,
put them in houses.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.273
Put food on your table,
presents under your tree.

33:05.150 --> 33:10.112
That's why your daddy protected me
all those years, no matter what befell him.

33:10.197 --> 33:14.033
But I wonder, after all he went through,

33:14.117 --> 33:18.120
what he'd think about you handing me
over to be tortured and killed?

33:18.955 --> 33:22.416
Well, under the circumstances,
I think he'd understand just fine.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.544
I think maybe you didn't know your daddy.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.130
Listen, Drew, Shelby,
whatever the hell your name is,

33:28.215 --> 33:30.299
I appreciate the play you're trying to make.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.260
But men like us,

33:33.345 --> 33:35.930
sooner or later, we got to reap what we sow.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.058
And this is your 6x6 plot of land.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.942
Well, amigo, this is where we part ways.

33:49.111 --> 33:52.279
Now, if it's any solace
during this difficult moment,

33:52.364 --> 33:57.118
know that your sacrifice will be providing
for the next generation of the Crowder family.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.795
Colt!

34:07.879 --> 34:10.297
You ready to make your penance?

34:12.634 --> 34:14.467
Don't forget my money.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.399
You're not worried.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.068
I wasn't, till you started up.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.571
Letting this ride
on the word of Johnny Crowder.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.697
You were there.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.574
He made a very compelling argument.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.493
Or we just got played
like a bunch of first-class chumps.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.581
Drop's in one of
the fields down off Gentry Road.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.498
Where the hell is Gentry Road?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.042
That way.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.049
Turn right.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.551
How much time do we have?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.011
Didn't say.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.013
How are we supposed to know which field?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.724
Apparently, all we got to do is look up.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.982
She was at my house, you know.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.360
The whore cowering
underneath kitchen table

35:13.445 --> 35:16.530
while you were prowling
around the entryway.

35:16.615 --> 35:20.701
All I could do to keep from laughing
my ass off, watching you hoot and holler.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.330
You were a military policeman, right?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.248
That's nice police work.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.209
Pretty sure her goddamn sweater

35:28.293 --> 35:30.336
was draped over the chair
right by where you were standing.

35:33.715 --> 35:38.344
Is that who you are? Hit a defenceless
old man about to punch his ticket?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.095
Well, I told you to "shh".

35:40.722 --> 35:42.348
You junkie pussy.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.558
You got no balls.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.851
Don't push me.

35:45.936 --> 35:48.938
You're gonna die at Boyd's hand
once he uses you up.

35:49.606 --> 35:52.399
What are you gonna do with that?
Wave it around, try and look tough?

35:53.610 --> 35:54.985
Go ahead. Try me. Keep talking.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.074
You haven't got the stones.
You couldn't hurt anybody,

36:00.158 --> 36:03.410
except maybe a weak, broken-down whore.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.333
You ain't man enough to pull that trigger.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.086
But go on. Do it.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.004
Do it!

36:24.975 --> 36:26.183
Nice try.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.186
I appreciate your effort.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.148
You are gonna wish that I shot you.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.697
What do you think they're gonna do to you
once they get a hold of you, huh?

36:40.615 --> 36:41.991
Cut you up in pieces?

36:42.534 --> 36:43.784
Waterboard you?

36:44.744 --> 36:46.203
And cut out that eye?

36:46.288 --> 36:48.247
You heard about that, huh?

36:49.332 --> 36:51.750
I've seen men in the service die slow.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.171
It is a horrible way to go.

36:58.258 --> 37:01.802
Please. Boyd will still get his money.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.647
I think your ride is here.

37:19.446 --> 37:20.946
Happy trails.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.684
Go! Go, go, go.

37:59.653 --> 38:03.030
Boyd's guy Colt
ran up the road there into the woods.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.449
Handcuff keys are
on the fence post over there.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.992
Tim?

38:07.661 --> 38:09.828
Rachel, back him up.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.706
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.124
Thanks for coming out.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.127
Anything for Drew Thompson.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.463
Yeah. Sorry I didn't mention it sooner.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.215
What fun would that have been?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.261
I guess this is where
I'm supposed to surrender.

38:26.346 --> 38:29.890
You can tell us everything now or let
it be a big surprise later.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.601
You get me out of here,
I'll give you whatever you want.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.311
Where's your girlfriend?

38:34.396 --> 38:37.523
She's at Limehouse's place.
She's gonna need your help.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.358
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

38:53.206 --> 38:54.373
That was Colt.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.793
The marshals got to Drew before Nicky could.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.547
How is that possible?

39:07.929 --> 39:09.096
What do we do?

39:11.808 --> 39:13.600
We make a case to Theo.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.311
Or?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.565
Or we run.

39:30.493 --> 39:32.745
That was Nicky Augustine.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.415
The marshals have Drew Thompson.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.666
Shit.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.462
Yes. That.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.842
He wants us down in Harlan.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.761
We gonna go?

39:52.140 --> 39:53.307
Do you have a passport?

39:53.767 --> 39:55.434
You need a passport to get into Harlan?

39:55.518 --> 39:57.895
No, you need a passport to get into Canada.

39:59.481 --> 40:00.731
Are you serious?

40:00.815 --> 40:02.024
Would you prefer Mexico?

40:02.442 --> 40:04.234
I'd prefer not running away like a little bitch.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.529
Okay.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.823
You can stay.

40:11.868 --> 40:16.371
I don't know how
I'll survive without you, but I'll try to get by.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.838
Is it just me, or they look empty-handed?

40:24.923 --> 40:27.091
Well, this could be
a real big thing for you, Raylan.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.719
Bump you up a couple of grades,
get your choice of assignment.

40:30.804 --> 40:32.638
Could be a whole new life for you.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.556
Your kid, too.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.683
Still gonna suspend me for Hunter Mosley?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.769
You bet your ass.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.188
But still, enjoy this.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.356
This?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.109
We're standing in a field.
We haven't done shit.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.112
He got to his car before we could get to him.

40:48.613 --> 40:49.863
So what's next?

40:49.948 --> 40:53.617
Theo Tonin knows we got Drew.
He's not gonna be too happy about that.

40:53.701 --> 40:57.663
Meaning we just got
to figure out how to get out of Harlan alive.
