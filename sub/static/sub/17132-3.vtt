WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:03.003
(George) YOU GOT IT?
(Ernie) YEAH, I GOT IT.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.872
EASY. EASY.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.474
(grunts)

00:08.509 --> 00:10.211
OH.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.650
IT'S PERFECT.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.188
FIRE IT UP, GEORGE.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.058
WAIT.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.526
I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.995
ERNIE, YOU WERE THERE
WHEN I MET ANGIE,

00:27.995 --> 00:30.198
AND YOU WERE THERE
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.932
YOU WERE THERE
FOR THE BIRTH OF MY KIDS AND...

00:31.932 --> 00:36.337
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE BIGGEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE!

00:38.139 --> 00:40.441
HEY, THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR, GEORGE.

00:40.441 --> 00:44.112
ALL RIGHT. YOU WERE THERE
WHEN I, UH...

00:44.112 --> 00:46.046
FOR MY, UH...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.117
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME THAT...

00:49.117 --> 00:51.152
LET'S JUST WATCH THE TV.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.791
WHAT IS IT?

00:57.791 --> 01:00.361
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOOKED EVERYTHING UP RIGHT.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.131
(gasps)
WHAT IF IT'S DEFECTIVE?

01:03.131 --> 01:04.598
THAT'S PERFECT.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.268
ALL I WANTED WAS A BIG-SCREEN TV
WITH SURROUND SOUND.

01:07.268 --> 01:11.205
CAN'T I BE HAPPY ONCE?

01:11.205 --> 01:13.774
DAMN IT!
WHEN IS IT GEORGE LOPEZ TIME?

01:13.774 --> 01:16.210
HEY, GEORGE,
ARE THE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE?

01:16.210 --> 01:19.313
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, MAN.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.081
EH, DON'T START THE MOVIE YET,
ALL RIGHT?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.217
I'M GONNA GO
MAKE SOME POPCORN.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.390
AHEM. GEORGE, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.925
SORRY, WE DON'T TALK
IN THE MEDIA ROOM.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.195
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SPEAK HERE
ARE CLINT EASTWOOD

01:34.195 --> 01:37.798
AND THOSE PEOPLE BEGGING NOT
TO BE KILLED BY CLINT EASTWOOD.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.467
(gunfire)

01:39.467 --> 01:43.204
LOOK AT THAT PICTURE, ANGIE.
H.D.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.174
THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
(explosion)

01:46.174 --> 01:48.676
THIS REALLY MAKES YOU HAPPY,
DOESN'T IT?

01:48.676 --> 01:51.379
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE ABLE
TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:51.379 --> 01:53.381
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, ANGIE.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.416
I MEAN, THANKS FOR
LETTING ME HAVE THIS.

01:55.416 --> 01:58.186
HI, UNCLE GEORGE!

01:58.186 --> 02:00.154
HEY, VERONICA!
WHAT'S UP?
(sighs)

02:00.154 --> 02:02.190
HOW'S COLLEGE?

02:02.190 --> 02:05.025
IT'S THE BEST THING I'VE EVER
DONE. YOU WERE TOTALLY RIGHT.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.361
SEE, YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

02:07.361 --> 02:11.399
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T REALIZE
I'M RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.534
CHECK OUT WHAT I DID
WITH CARMEN'S OLD ROOM.

02:13.534 --> 02:17.171
THIS IS THE GEORGE LOPEZ
HOME THEATER EXPERIENCE.

02:17.171 --> 02:23.411
(imitates T.H.X. theme)

02:23.411 --> 02:25.579
THE GEORGE IS LISTENING.

02:25.579 --> 02:31.084
HONEY, WOULDN'T THIS TV
BE GREAT IN OUR BEDROOM?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.820
WE COULD WATCH MOVIES IN BED.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.087
NO WAY.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.225
YOU GOT ENOUGH DISTRACTIONS
IN THE BEDROOM ALREADY.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.227
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY NOTHING,

02:39.227 --> 02:42.162
BUT YOU'VE KINDA BEEN
OFF YOUR GAME LATELY.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.131
OKAY.

02:44.131 --> 02:48.001
THE THING IS, VERONICA'S
TRUST FUND HAS JUST BEEN FROZEN.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.771
ONE OF HER RELATIVES
IS CONTESTING HER MOM'S WILL.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.674
SO I'M TOTALLY
GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.943
AND I TOTALLY
NEED A PLACE TO LIVE.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.246
(Angie) AND I WAS THINKING,

02:58.246 --> 03:00.714
SINCE WE HAVE
THIS EXTRA BEDROOM...

03:02.149 --> 03:03.817
GEORGE.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.654
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TOTALLY GET A JOB?

03:06.654 --> 03:10.458
I MEAN THEY FROZE YOUR ASSETS,
NOT YOUR ASS.

03:12.426 --> 03:15.028
UNCLE GEORGE,
I CAN'T WORK FULL-TIME

03:15.028 --> 03:17.197
AND STILL GO TO ALL MY CLASSES,
AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID

03:17.197 --> 03:19.233
IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO GO TO COLLEGE.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.036
OKAY. HERE'S THE THING--
YOU'RE NOT ENDING WORLD HUNGER.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.805
OKAY? IT'S A FASHION SCHOOL.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.807
SO LET'S STOP
DROPPING THE COLLEGE BOMBS.

03:26.807 --> 03:31.979
UNCLE GEORGE,
I'VE GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.848
MY GOD, IF YOU WANT ME TO BEG,
I'LL BEG.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.318
PLEASE?

03:37.318 --> 03:40.288
THAT'S HOW I BEG.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.356
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US

03:42.356 --> 03:44.492
A FEW MINUTES
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

03:44.492 --> 03:47.861
AUNT ANGIE AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK THIS THROUGH.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.531
NO.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.634
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

03:57.305 --> 03:59.172
* ALL MY FRIENDS

03:59.172 --> 04:00.808
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:04.211 --> 04:07.548
* THE LOW RIDER

04:07.548 --> 04:11.151
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

04:11.151 --> 04:14.755
**

04:19.360 --> 04:21.662
(machine gunfire,
explosions)

04:21.662 --> 04:24.598
YOU CAN'T JUST
DROWN ME OUT.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.768
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF
THIS SYSTEM, ANGIE. NOW I CAN.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.738
GEORGE!

04:30.738 --> 04:33.941
I'LL LAY DOWN COVER FIRE!
YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DOOR!

04:33.941 --> 04:35.843
GO, ANGIE! GO! GO! GO!

04:37.311 --> 04:38.612
(TV turns off)

04:38.612 --> 04:41.248
COME ON, ANGIE,
LOOK, I LIKE VERONICA.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.584
BUT I ALREADY DID THE PARENTING
THING WITH HER ONCE.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.853
IF SHE MOVES IN, I'M GONNA
END UP RAISING ANOTHER KID.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.188
WE WON'T BE RAISING HER.
SHE'S 21.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.190
SHE'S GOT HER OWN LIFE.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.860
BUT WE'RE JUST DOWN
TO THE BOY.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.297
A COUPLE OF YEARS,
HE'LL BE GONE.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.099
THEN IT'LL JUST BE
ME AND YOU,

04:59.099 --> 05:01.301
YOU IN YOUR ROOM,
RESEARCHING BED AND BREAKFASTS

05:01.301 --> 05:03.571
THAT I'LL NEVER GO TO.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.440
AND ME IN HERE, WATCHING MOVIES
WITH THE DOOR SHUT.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.809
ISN'T THE THE LIFE
WE ALWAYS WANTED TOGETHER?

05:10.978 --> 05:14.281
I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU PUT
YOUR BIG SCREEN TV,

05:14.281 --> 05:15.849
BUT SHE IS FAMILY,

05:15.849 --> 05:18.686
AND SHE IS GONNA STAY IN
THIS ROOM. END OF DISCUSSION.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.987
HOW ABOUT IF--
END...

05:19.987 --> 05:21.422
OF DISCUSSION.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.825
DAMN, ALL RIGHT.
SHE CAN STAY HERE.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.860
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU WON.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.195
I KNOW I DIDN'T.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.364
AND I DIDN'T GIVE IN.
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.600
HEY, AND DON'T WALK
AWAY FROM ME.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.903
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M DOING AT ALL.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.244
HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
TODAY IS?

05:44.244 --> 05:47.247
OH, MAN.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.417
I'M SORRY I FORGOT.
I JUST THOUGHT GETTING A CARD

05:49.417 --> 05:51.585
WOULD CHEAPEN IT, ANGIE,
WHATEVER IT IS.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.223
IT'S YOUR MOM'S BIRTHDAY.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.058
WE PROMISED TO VISIT HER
IN JAIL.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.630
THAT'S RIGHT. HEY, THIS IS
GONNA BE TOUGH ON HER.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.332
SHE HASN'T HAD A BIRTHDAY
WITHOUT BOOZE OR MEN

06:05.332 --> 06:06.667
SINCE SHE WAS 8.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.170
IS VERONICA UP YET?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.173
NO. SHE'S UP LATE EVERY NIGHT.
SHE SLEEPS IN EVERY MORNING.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.844
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH
MY BIG SCREEN IN A WEEK.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.448
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN RENT
A MOVIE AND WATCH IT TONIGHT

06:20.448 --> 06:21.982
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.086
ON WHAT, A 27-INCH?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.388
WHAT AM I, A CAVEMAN?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.792
WHY DON'T WE JUST WATCH FIRE?

06:34.261 --> 06:35.796
HEY, LOOK WHO'S UP.

06:35.796 --> 06:39.700
YEAH, SORRY. I WAS TALKING
TO MY BOYFRIEND ALL NIGHT.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.334
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
MM-HMM.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.336
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT HIM?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.138
OH, WE JUST STARTED
GOING OUT.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.675
DAD, THERE'S SOME DUDE
IN THE BATHROOM.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.744
SHOULD I GET THE BAT?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.382
MORNING.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.686
SORRY, LITTLE BUDDY,
I SHOULD'VE LOCKED THE DOOR.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.488
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

07:00.488 --> 07:02.122
OH, UNCLE GEORGE
AND AUNT ANGIE,

07:02.122 --> 07:05.158
THIS IS MIKE, MY PROFESSOR
FROM THE FASHION INSTITUTE.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.127
I MEAN, MY BOYFRIEND.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.731
I HAVE TO GET USED TO
SAYING THAT.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.667
NICE TO MEET YOU.
MIKE LANGWORTHY.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.837
I KNOW THIS IS AWKWARD
AND EVERYTHING.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.907
YEAH, STICK AROUND.
SEE HOW AWKWARD IT GETS.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.813
WELL,
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
OKAY.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.883
OH! THAT'S A HELL OF A TV
YOU'VE GOT UPSTAIRS.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.253
OKAY,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, HUH?

07:33.253 --> 07:36.156
YOU DON'T BRING SOME OLDER GUY
TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN MY HOUSE.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.626
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A WEEK,
AND YOU'RE PULLING THIS?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.393
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.596
HE WAS DRINKING, AND I DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO DRIVE HOME.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.164
AND YOU GUYS WERE ASLEEP,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.166
SO I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT HIM
TO STAY HERE.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.169
NOT NOW. ANGIE, WE'LL DEAL WITH
YOUR SCREWED UP FAMILY LATER.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.973
WE GOTTA GET TO THE JAIL
FOR MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.815
(all) HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.355
OKAY, MOM,
WE GOT YOU A CAKE, HUH?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.057
MAKE A WISH.

08:10.057 --> 08:15.328
LET'S SEE, I'M ABOUT TO
GO ON TRIAL FOR AN ARMED ROBBERY

08:15.328 --> 08:17.164
THAT MY EX-BOYFRIEND COMMITTED.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.634
OH, YESTERDAY I WASHED UNDERWEAR
FOR 600 WOMEN.

08:20.634 --> 08:25.539
AND MY CELL MATE'S
DELOUSING DIDN'T TAKE.

08:25.539 --> 08:29.442
HMM... I WISH FOR A PONY.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.679
A PONY IT IS.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.985
THEY DON'T ALLOW
A LOT OF STUFF, MOM,

08:37.985 --> 08:39.987
BUT WE DID GET YOU
A PRESENT.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.855
NOW WE KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.191
BUT IN CASE YOU DON'T,
SOME CHALK, HUH?

08:44.191 --> 08:47.661
YOU CAN DRAW A DOOR ON THE WALL,
AND YOU CAN ESCAPE...

08:47.661 --> 08:49.496
YOU KNOW, IN YOUR MIND.

08:49.496 --> 08:51.732
PUT VERONICA ON.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.369
UH, YOU KNOW, HONEY,
IT WARMS MY HEART THAT YOU CAME

08:56.369 --> 08:59.607
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE TO VISIT
YOUR GRANDMOTHER-IN-LAW.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.941
WHAT DO YOU SAY

09:00.941 --> 09:03.911
WE TAPE INTO YOUR TRUST FUND
AND PAY MY BAIL?

09:03.911 --> 09:06.079
OH, JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.649
WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?

09:11.752 --> 09:14.021
MY TRUST FUND'S FROZEN.
I CAN'T GET ANY MONEY.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.223
I'M LIVING
WITH THESE GUYS AGAIN.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.658
OH, YEAH?

09:17.658 --> 09:19.026
IF YOU'RE SO BROKE,

09:19.026 --> 09:21.995
HOW'D YOU GET THAT
DIAMOND TENNIS BRACELET?

09:21.995 --> 09:25.733
DO YOU LIKE IT? IT'S NEW!
MY BOYFRIEND BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.334
LET'S SEE...

09:27.334 --> 09:31.304
WHAT DO YOU CALL A GIRL
WHO GOES OUT WITH AN OLDER GUY

09:31.304 --> 09:33.106
BECAUSE HE GIVES HER THINGS?

09:33.106 --> 09:36.243
OH, IT'S ON THE TIP
OF MY TONGUE.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.579
IT RHYMES WITH "ROSTITUTE."
WHAT...

09:39.579 --> 09:42.415
UNCLE GEORGE, THAT IS NOT WHY
I'M SEEING HIM, OKAY?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.785
HE'S MATURE. HE LIKES BEING
WITH ME. HE MAKES ME HAPPY.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.586
I CAN SEE WHOEVER I WANT
ANYWAY.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.889
HEY, NOT IN MY HOUSE. HE'S NOT
SPENDING THE NIGHT AGAIN.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.925
YOU WOULD RATHER HE TAKE ME
TO SOME SLEAZY MOTEL?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.961
I'LL MAKE THE RESERVATION!

09:53.961 --> 09:57.931
MOM, WHERE DO YOU
USUALLY GO?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.367
WAIT A MINUTE, GEORGE.
HE'S BUYING HER EXPENSIVE THINGS

10:00.367 --> 10:04.604
AND HE WON'T TAKE HER BACK
TO HIS PLACE?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.740
SHE'S SEEING
A MARRIED MAN.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.645
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT SEEING
A MARRIED GUY.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.182
PROSTITUTE! THAT'S IT!

10:15.182 --> 10:17.317
THAT'S WHAT RHYMES
WITH "ROSTITUTE."

10:17.317 --> 10:19.552
MAX!

10:19.552 --> 10:21.354
I JUST WANNA THANK YOU.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.891
I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
MAKE MY BIRTHDAY FUN,

10:23.891 --> 10:26.960
BUT THIS IS PRETTY GREAT!

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
MAX, UPSTAIRS.
ARE YOU GUYS GONNA TALK

10:40.040 --> 10:41.775
ABOUT VERONICA'S THING
FOR MARRIED GUYS?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.110
UPSTAIRS!

10:43.110 --> 10:46.113
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.115
I'M THINKING
ABOUT MARRYING HER.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.217
DOES THAT DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.620
MAX, SHE'S NOT INTO GUYS
WHO WALK FUNNY.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.088
I DON'T WALK FUNNY.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.091
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.
YOU DO.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.594
DON'T YOU REALIZE DATING
A MARRIED MAN TWICE YOUR AGE

11:01.594 --> 11:04.264
IS GONNA BLOW UP
IN YOUR FACE?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.299
I'M TIRED
OF DATING GUYS MY AGE.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.435
THEY PLAY GAMES,
AND I WIND UP GETTING HURT.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.637
AT LEAST WITH MIKE,
I KNOW IT'S NOT SERIOUS.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.439
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.
IT'S CASUAL.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.242
AND WHAT ABOUT MIKE'S WIFE?
IS SHE HAVING FUN, TOO?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.644
OH, HIS WIFE DOESN'T
GET HIM ANYMORE.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.446
SHE HAS TRUST ISSUES.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.482
EVERY TIME HE'S WORKING LATE,
SHE THINKS HE'S CHEATING.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.185
MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU'RE HIDING UNDER THE BED,

11:25.185 --> 11:27.955
YOU CAN SLIDE OUT
AND EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.524
UNCLE GEORGE,
I CAN HANDLE IT, OKAY?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.227
NO, YOU CAN'T.
YOU'RE IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.229
LOOK, I TOLD YOU WE'D END UP
RAISING ANOTHER KID,

11:36.229 --> 11:38.231
AND WE CAN'T EVEN PUNISH HER
BY SENDING HER TO HER ROOM

11:38.231 --> 11:41.601
BECAUSE THEN SHE HAS HIGH DEF
AND SURROUND SOUND.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.403
I MEAN,
I GUESS I COULD PROGRAM IT

11:43.403 --> 11:47.741
TO 2-CHANNEL STEREO,
BUT THEN EVERYBODY LOSES.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.083
DUDE, LEAVE MY NIECE ALONE.
MAN, YOU'RE MARRIED!

11:56.083 --> 11:58.085
AND WHY DO YOU HAVE
A SUITCASE?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.387
I JUST LEFT MY WIFE.
I LOVE YOU, VERONICA.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.023
NOW NOTHING STANDS BETWEEN US
BEING TOGETHER.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.927
THERE IS ONE THING--
WAAPAHH!

12:16.736 --> 12:18.471
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.841
I'M GETTING RID OF THIS GUY
RIGHT NOW.
NO!

12:20.841 --> 12:22.109
THEY'RE TALKING IT OUT.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.512
IF IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL,
THEN WE INTERVENE.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.247
YOU LOVE THIS.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.849
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.550
ALL THE DRAMA!

12:30.550 --> 12:33.586
YOU LOVE BEING SURROUNDED BY
CRAZY PEOPLE SO YOU CAN FIX 'EM.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.224
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE DRAMA QUEEN,
AND THIS IS YOUR KINGDOM.

12:37.224 --> 12:40.727
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT YOU'RE STARTING TO ANNOY ME.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.762
AND THAT'D BE WHAT?
MORE DRAMA?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.532
HMM, GOOD NEWS FOR THE QUEEN.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.637
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.873
YES. I TOLD HIM HE WAS
TAKING THINGS TOO SERIOUSLY,

12:52.873 --> 12:54.474
AND I WANTED OUT.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.210
SEE? I SAID I WOULD HANDLE IT,
AND I DID. IT'S OVER.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.247
THEN WHY IS HE STILL
IN MY YARD?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.019
NOT MY BOYFRIEND.
NOT MY PROBLEM.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.826
GEORGE, WE SHOULD
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.728
I'LL TURN
THE SPRINKLERS ON.
NO!

13:15.728 --> 13:17.664
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.932
OH, BUT OF COURSE.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.569
AFTER YOU, MY QUEEN.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.842
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.879
NOT REALLY.

13:35.849 --> 13:40.320
YOU KNOW, I KNOW YOUR EYES ARE
ALL BLEARY WITH TEARS AND ALL,

13:40.320 --> 13:43.423
BUT THE GATE'S
RIGHT OVER THERE.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.627
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.530
YOU JUST LIFT UP THE LATCH,
AND THE DOOR OPENS.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.402
I THINK...

13:55.402 --> 13:57.604
YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO YOUR WIFE

13:57.604 --> 13:59.907
AND TELL HER YOU MADE
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE

13:59.907 --> 14:01.909
AND TRY TO WORK THINGS OUT.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.577
I DON'T WANNA GO BACK.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.579
I LOVE VERONICA.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.716
I GUESS YOU JUST NEED
TIME TO PROCESS THIS.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.752
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.587
WE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.457
CAN I TURN
THE SPRINKLERS ON NOW?
FIRE AWAY.

14:25.498 --> 14:29.002
AT LEAST NOW NO ONE'S
GONNA KNOW YOU WERE CRYING!

14:35.575 --> 14:39.479
(telephone rings)

14:39.479 --> 14:41.048
(ring)

14:41.048 --> 14:44.051
(sighs)
IT'S MIKE AGAIN.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.919
(ring)
AND THE MACHINE IS FULL.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.221
I'M GONNA TALK
TO THIS FOOL.
(ring)

14:48.221 --> 14:51.458
NO, MAYBE IF WE JUST
IGNORE HIM, HE'LL GO AWAY.

14:51.458 --> 14:55.128
I MEAN, HE CAN'T KEEP THIS UP
FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.730
GEORGE!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.566
LOOK!
WHAT THE HELL?

15:03.303 --> 15:06.706
"SOME BUNNY
STILL LOVES YOU."

15:06.706 --> 15:09.576
I THOUGHT I TOLD CARL
IN SHIPPING I'M STRAIGHT.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.080
I GOTTA STOP WEARING
THOSE BLUE PANTS.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.348
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR
TO HIM.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.650
APPARENTLY,
HE CAN'T QUIT ME.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.090
THIS IS FROM MIKE.

15:23.090 --> 15:27.027
HE WAS HERE IN OUR YARD.
THIS IS GETTING SCARY.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.032
VERONICA, THIS GUY'S
NOT GETTING THE MESSAGE.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.200
OH, MY GOD.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.202
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS IS STUFFED

15:35.202 --> 15:38.638
AND NOT MIKE
IN A BUNNY SUIT.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.207
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.475
MIKE, ARE YOU IN THERE?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.512
MIKE?

15:48.448 --> 15:51.584
IT'S STUFFED,
OR I GOT HIM.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.187
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET RID OF HIM.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.691
I MEAN, I DROPPED HIS CLASS,
BUT HE KEEPS CALLING ME,

15:58.691 --> 16:01.161
SENDING ME E-MAILS,
FOLLOWING ME AROUND CAMPUS.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.862
IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.164
(cell phone rings)
IT'S MIKE.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.499
HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.901
YOU DON'T TAKE HIS CALLS.
YOU GOTTA CUT HIM OFF CLEAN.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.770
BUT I'M TRYING TO GET HIM
TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S OVER.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.772
EVERY TIME YOU TALK TO HIM,
YOU'RE JUST ENCOURAGING HIM.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.774
YOU GOTTA GET
INSIDE THE STALKER'S MIND.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.776
I KNEW THIS GUY WHO WAS
SO IN LOVE WITH THIS WOMAN,

16:16.776 --> 16:18.611
HE FOLLOWED HER TO WORK,
LEFT NOTES ON HER CAR,

16:18.611 --> 16:20.313
CAMPED OUT AT HER HOUSE.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.316
I FINALLY HAD TO SAY, "LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T KNOCK THIS OFF,

16:23.316 --> 16:26.653
ERNIE, YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO JAIL."

16:28.088 --> 16:32.125
THAT WAS A REALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE SUMMER FOR ME.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.794
(cell phone rings)
IT'S HIM AGAIN.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.830
LET ME ANSWER IT.
NO, I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
WITH THIS, OKAY, UNCLE GEORGE?

16:37.830 --> 16:41.134
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MIKE MYSELF. MIKE...

16:41.134 --> 16:43.736
YOU HAVE TO STOP CALLING ME.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.140
WOULD YOU THROW
THIS THING OUT?

16:47.140 --> 16:49.509
I'M NOT GONNA WASTE THIS.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.579
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:52.579 --> 16:55.948
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ANGIE.
LOVE, GEORGE."

16:55.948 --> 16:57.384
I'LL PUT THIS
IN THE CLOSET.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.652
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET

16:59.652 --> 17:01.854
THE DIAMOND EARRINGS
YOU ASKED FOR...

17:01.854 --> 17:03.290
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.194
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M GONNA TELL YOU,

17:07.194 --> 17:09.696
I NEVER WANNA SPEAK
TO YOU AGAIN. IT'S OVER!

17:09.696 --> 17:12.299
DON'T SAY IT'S OVER.
AAH!

17:16.736 --> 17:18.105
GET OUT OF HERE.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.773
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE WORK THIS OUT.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.210
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HEY, THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.213
MY NIECE, MY BUSINESS.
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.780
LOOK, THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE ANY FIGHTING.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.282
JUST RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

17:29.282 --> 17:34.254
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS
LIKE TWO CIVILIZED--
UHH!

17:34.254 --> 17:37.690
I JUST LOST THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE! CALL 9-1-1!

17:41.094 --> 17:43.530
WHY, ANGIE, WHY DID THIS
HAVE TO HAPPEN?

17:43.530 --> 17:47.567
HONEY, YOU DID
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

17:47.567 --> 17:52.272
IT JUST HURTS
THAT I COULDN'T PROTECT HER.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.910
YOU DIDN'T HURT ANYONE.

17:57.910 --> 18:04.551
YOU WERE JUST HANGING THERE,
MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.018
GEORGE...

18:06.018 --> 18:09.222
YOU BEAT UP THE GUY
WHO WAS THREATENING YOUR NIECE.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.258
YOU'RE A HERO.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.262
THE COPS ARE ABOUT
TO LEAVE.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.099
I CAN STILL HEAR A MOVIE.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.071
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP,
OFFICER.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.840
SO...

18:27.840 --> 18:30.410
MIKE'S GONNA BE IN JAIL
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

18:30.410 --> 18:32.579
AND I CAN GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER TOMORROW.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.248
WELL, I HOPE YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.250
YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT.

18:37.250 --> 18:41.188
YOU DIDN'T THROW DOWN
WITH SOME BRITISH DRESSMAKER.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.755
SEWING MUST MAKE
YOUR HANDS STRONG,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.724
BECAUSE THAT DUDE
ALMOST CHOKED ME OUT.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.829
I HOPE YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON.
I DID. I'M SORRY.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.398
AND?

18:51.398 --> 18:54.734
AND FROM NOW ON,
I'M LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE,

18:54.734 --> 18:56.603
I'LL FOLLOW YOUR RULES.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.805
AND?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.907
AND?

19:00.907 --> 19:03.243
WHAT?
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.212
I GOT A BROKEN PLASMA SCREEN,

19:05.212 --> 19:07.347
AND YOU GOT
A DIAMOND TENNIS BRACELET.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.549
GUESS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

19:09.549 --> 19:10.617
(gasps)

19:10.617 --> 19:12.252
AUNT ANGIE...

19:12.252 --> 19:14.321
YOU HEARD HIM.
HAND IT OVER.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.693
WHAT'S WRITTEN
ON YOUR HAND?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.729
OH, THAT'S CHUCK'S
PHONE NUMBER.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.231
WHO'S CHUCK?

19:24.231 --> 19:26.132
THE COP WHO JUST LEFT.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.201
THAT GUY'S GOTTA BE
35 YEARS OLD.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.771
RELAX, UNCLE GEORGE,
HE'S NOT MARRIED.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.441
HE'S SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE,
AND HE'S SIX WEEKS SOBER.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.844
OH, ALL RIGHT!
HIGH FIVE!

19:37.844 --> 19:39.512
YES!

19:42.915 --> 19:44.651
HEY!

19:44.651 --> 19:47.787
NO ONE TOLD ME
WE WERE WASHING VERONICA.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.457
I WANT A PART.
