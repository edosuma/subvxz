(female narrator)
Previously
on Children's Hospital.

00:04.538 --> 00:07.675
Two things...number one,
I get hard when a woman cries.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.778
Number two, your daughter
will never walk again.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.181
Oh my God!

00:15.516 --> 00:17.418
Lola is dead.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.354
I hear her ghost still haunts
the old, haunted locker room.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.056
A-ah!

00:22.090 --> 00:24.325
Is it crazy
that I faked my own death

00:24.358 --> 00:26.627
because I had
too many emails.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.596
We lost her.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.399
- Don't you blame yourself.
- Well, I don't blame myself.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.201
- Don't!
- I don't, I'm serious.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.304
- Don't you do that.
- Does it look like it.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.106
I shouldn't have
given that impression.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.508
- This is not on you.
- I'm not blaming myself.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.444
Relax. It wasn't my fault at
all. It was Bette's fault.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.546
'Sittin' there
all that time.'

00:45.579 --> 00:48.149
[impersonating]
I'm not a doctor, what do I do?

00:49.283 --> 00:52.220
[theme music]

00:55.123 --> 00:56.857
(male on speaker)
'Attention, staff.'

00:56.890 --> 00:59.293
I was working in the lab,
late one night..

00:59.327 --> 01:00.694
Hey! Come on!

01:06.200 --> 01:09.403
'He did the mash.
He did the monster mash!'

01:09.437 --> 01:13.874
'The Monster mash! The
graveyard's mash. That's all!'

01:13.907 --> 01:16.577
(female narrator)
Happy Halloween!

01:16.610 --> 01:19.247
But then again,
what's so happy about it?

01:19.280 --> 01:23.151
For some, it's all about
dead people.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.586
- 'Owen.'
- Aargh!

01:25.619 --> 01:28.722
Go away, ghost Lola, before
I call Bill Murray to bust you.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.659
With a black guy
whose name I can't remember.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.727
- Aargh!
- I'm not dead.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.763
No one believes me.
And it's Ernie Hudson.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.598
They don't call you
Lola in heaven?

01:37.631 --> 01:39.800
The black eye from Ghostbusters.
He's Ernie Hudson.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.569
If you're not dead,
prove it.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.137
I'm not peeing on you.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.439
I'm gonna find a way
to bone you.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.675
You wanna bone me
even though I'm not alive?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.643
You are a ghost,
I knew it!

01:49.677 --> 01:51.445
[screaming]

01:51.479 --> 01:53.481
'Hey, Dr. Maestro.
Who's the ghost!'

01:53.514 --> 01:55.883
Look, I know it's
a Children's Hospital.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.319
But it's Halloween
and the real hospital is packed.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.653
Okay, what you've got?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.722
Okay. A sorority party bus
flipped over.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.726
I got a sexy French maid,
sexy schoolgirl, sexy cop.

02:05.759 --> 02:09.363
Sexy Alice in Wonderland,
sexy nurse, sexy stripper

02:09.396 --> 02:12.833
Chewbacca, sexy hot dog,
sexy homeless person.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.935
And sexy section drywall.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.571
'Okay, drywall.
Got it.'

02:18.972 --> 02:21.309
Sexy handicapped doctor.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.744
I'd like to show her
my sexy costume.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.614
- Ew!
- What? Oh..

02:26.647 --> 02:29.417
No, I just really wanna
show her my sexy costume.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.719
Not kill her. Ha-ha-ha.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.720
Whatever!

02:34.622 --> 02:37.491
I really wanna have sex
with Lola, but she's a ghost.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.560
The only way
for me to do that

02:39.593 --> 02:42.396
is to cross over to
the spirit realm and find her.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.298
You gotta flat-line me.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.334
This isn't gonna work.
It's not the movies.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.869
Hurry up, kill me, Flame,
before I change my mind.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.305
And when do I
shock you back to life?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.641
You got a cell phone.
Let's set an alarm.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.476
- Alright.
- 10 minutes.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.611
That'll give me enough time
to find her

02:57.645 --> 02:59.780
and make love to her
several times.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.315
I'm fast.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.551
But I reset quickly.
It's one of my things.

03:03.584 --> 03:07.721
One more thing. When I'm under,
no peeking at my wiener, okay?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.957
If you do peak,
I'll tell you it's intense.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.226
So don't look directly into it..
Aargh!

03:12.260 --> 03:13.627
[grunts]

03:13.661 --> 03:15.296
[beeping]

03:15.329 --> 03:17.665
[melodic music]

03:17.698 --> 03:19.500
Am I dead?
Did I flat-line?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.435
(male on speaker)
'Attention, staff.'

03:21.469 --> 03:24.872
'At 4:00 pm, We'll all gather
around those radios'

03:24.905 --> 03:27.541
'to listen to President
Roosevelt's update on aboard.'

03:27.575 --> 03:29.443
'Everyone is welcome,
except Chaps.'

03:29.477 --> 03:31.345
Roosevelt? Chaps?

03:31.379 --> 03:35.249
I didn't die.
I time-travelled to 1987.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.251
Lola hasn't even
been born yet.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.353
I can show these people
modern medicine

03:39.387 --> 03:41.822
and get totally laid.
Excuse me, black and white lady.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.657
[shushing]

03:43.691 --> 03:46.026
It's Milado. And no one's
supposed to know that.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.663
If they find out I have a white
mother, they'll kick me out.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.300
Excuse me. I'm from
the future. I need your help.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.602
Okay, sweetheart.
You calm down and..

03:54.635 --> 03:57.438
Come on with me.
We'll bring you to see a doctor.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.708
Okay. We need to get on the
internet. Do you have a laptop?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.543
'Yes. When I sit down.'

04:02.576 --> 04:04.912
[thunder]

04:04.945 --> 04:06.580
[beeping]

04:06.614 --> 04:08.015
[door opens]
Nothing.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.318
[gasps]
Please don't hurt me.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.586
Wait, what're you doing here?
Owens's looking for you.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.388
I'm not a ghost!

04:14.422 --> 04:15.723
- Oh, yeah? Prove it!
- How?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.358
Drink this water to see
if it goes through you.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.361
Done!

04:20.394 --> 04:22.530
Hah! See, I told you.
You're a ghost.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.965
I'm not a ghost.
I have a really tight bladder.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.701
Alright, well, totally unrelated
to the ghost thing..

04:27.735 --> 04:30.070
Drink the rest while your dummy
sings "Camptown Races".

04:30.103 --> 04:31.839
Alright.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.741
[gurgling]

04:36.644 --> 04:38.612
Look at me, chief.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.515
You'll see me
in my sexy costume.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.951
'Yes you will.'

04:43.984 --> 04:45.353
Childrens.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.321
'Have you checked the children''

04:47.355 --> 04:48.622
- It's him again.
- Alright!

04:48.656 --> 04:50.558
Trace the call.
Come on.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.694
Well, that's gonna take about 30
to 45 seconds to figure out

04:53.727 --> 04:55.429
if we've checked
those children.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.665
Got it! It's coming from
inside the hospital.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.667
The maternity ward.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.935
[intense music]

05:01.969 --> 05:05.072
- Wait, is this Max?
- Yeah, man. Have you checked?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.907
'Cause, I've been
approved for an hour

05:06.940 --> 05:08.742
and nobody's been by
to check them.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.778
Yeah. I'll send
the chief up.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.846
Alright. Your-your throat
sounds terrible by the way.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.548
I'm coming, children.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.684
[dramatic music]

05:19.920 --> 05:21.689
What the..

05:21.722 --> 05:23.991
This isn't the maternity ward.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.726
Max!

05:25.759 --> 05:27.127
Hello!

05:27.160 --> 05:30.097
Anyone here?
It's me, Chief.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.434
[dramatic music]

05:35.803 --> 05:38.572
[screaming]

05:40.841 --> 05:43.043
Murderer!

05:43.076 --> 05:45.579
[screaming continues]

05:45.613 --> 05:47.815
(Chief)
Oh! My balls.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.053
[screaming continues]

05:54.955 --> 05:57.758
[screaming continues]

05:59.993 --> 06:02.029
I need two belt straps.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.932
[screaming]

06:04.965 --> 06:07.435
[music continues]

06:10.571 --> 06:14.007
I just gave you a shot
of this new drug Penicillin.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.710
It should calm you down,
or not!

06:16.744 --> 06:18.579
We don't know.
It might grow hair.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.415
Listen to me. I'm not crazy.
I'm from the future.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.985
And we don't have much time.
Together, we can save millions.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.621
Look this proves it!
A cell phone, from the future.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.989
[gasps]

06:29.022 --> 06:31.525
Ah! It just vibrated!

06:31.559 --> 06:33.727
Oh, no. That means
I'm outta time.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.964
I have an appointment
with the future.

06:36.997 --> 06:42.002
Well, I'm off to buy a hotdog
in the late edition for nickel.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.804
Take me now!

06:43.837 --> 06:46.039
I wanna know how they make
whoopee, space man.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.176
Space man? Okay,
but hold on just a second.

06:49.209 --> 06:53.046
Let me write myself stock tips,
so I can get rich in the future.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.416
Microsoft, Cisco..

06:59.987 --> 07:01.822
(male over speaker)
'Attention, all staff.'

07:01.855 --> 07:04.592
'Food in the cafeteria
is made of people.'

07:04.625 --> 07:07.127
'It's made of people.'

07:08.962 --> 07:11.465
Okay, here we go.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.036
[screaming]

07:20.240 --> 07:22.075
Out of my way, drywall.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.944
Help! Oh, God!

07:23.977 --> 07:25.145
Ah!

07:25.178 --> 07:27.147
[panting]

07:27.180 --> 07:29.517
(Chief)
'Oh, geez!'

07:29.550 --> 07:31.184
O-oh!
Whoa!

07:31.218 --> 07:32.953
[screams]

07:32.986 --> 07:34.888
Alright, everybody,
we've come to a decision

07:34.922 --> 07:37.057
on the costume contest.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.926
[people clapping]

07:38.959 --> 07:40.928
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

07:40.961 --> 07:43.230
The winner is
a three way tie between

07:43.263 --> 07:46.266
the sexy French maid,
sexy school girl

07:46.299 --> 07:48.135
and little Ernie Hudson.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.037
Can't get away
from him! Ah!

07:50.070 --> 07:53.173
And the only fair way to settle
this, the stripper pole.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.776
- Yeah!
- Ha-ha-ha. Here I am.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.881
'Gotta get away from him.
Ah-ah-ah!'

08:00.914 --> 08:02.916
I know, I'll shimmy
at that pole.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.553
No! No! Wait!
Chief! Hold her!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.855
[indistinct yelling]

08:07.888 --> 08:09.990
'No!'

08:10.023 --> 08:12.926
[screaming]
I'm sorry, I tormented you
as a teen.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.629
No, no, chief.
It's me, Chet!

08:15.663 --> 08:18.599
Yeah, I want to show you
my sexy costume.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.134
Oh my God! Thank God!

08:21.168 --> 08:22.903
Wait a minute, Chet.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.172
This is your costume?
I don't think it's sexy.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.541
No, no,
this is my scary costume.

08:27.575 --> 08:29.877
This is my sexy costume!

08:31.712 --> 08:33.746
[laughing]

08:33.780 --> 08:35.248
Oh!

08:35.282 --> 08:37.618
Folks, we have a winner.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.986
Sexy snake charmer.

'Apple, Google, Amazon.'

08:46.727 --> 08:48.896
EBay.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.899
Okay, let's do this.
Hmm..

08:51.932 --> 08:53.834
[moaning]

08:55.035 --> 08:57.337
[groaning]

08:57.370 --> 08:59.573
That was quick!

08:59.607 --> 09:01.074
Come one!

09:01.108 --> 09:02.643
[groaning]

09:02.676 --> 09:06.914
Stop zapping me.
Oh, it hurts!

09:06.947 --> 09:08.315
Did you find Lola?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.317
I didn't go
to the other side.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.285
I went back in time.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.121
Uh!
The stock tips.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.127
Microsoft, Cisco, EBay.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.895
Oh, wait..

09:21.929 --> 09:24.798
- Damn! Aargh! Ghost Lola.
- I'm not a ghost, okay.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.601
- I didn't die!
- But that day..

09:27.635 --> 09:29.269
The surgery,
I saw you.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.376
[sighs]

09:36.409 --> 09:39.346
[eerie humming]

09:44.685 --> 09:47.120
I'm just
a gifted ventriloquist.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.290
Wait. My phone.
Oh my God, you guys..

09:50.323 --> 09:54.061
I left my phone in the 1980's.
Do you know what this means?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.931
[instrumental music]

10:01.401 --> 10:07.140
- Can it be you?
- I've waited so long.

10:07.174 --> 10:10.911
It hasn't been very long for me.
It's been like a minute.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.747
- Okay, well, but..
- Oh, yeah..

10:13.781 --> 10:14.948
[moaning]

10:14.982 --> 10:16.917
You taste like
vitamins. Hmm..

10:17.951 --> 10:19.920
[moaning continues]

10:19.953 --> 10:23.256
- That's actually kinda hot.
- Wait till she sees his wiener.

10:25.092 --> 10:28.328
* It's now the monster mash

10:28.361 --> 10:31.832
* And it's a
graveyard smash *

10:31.865 --> 10:35.235
* It's a horn in a flash

10:35.268 --> 10:37.905
* It's now the monster mash

10:37.938 --> 10:41.775
Chief, I have so many things
I wanna show you.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.912
- Like what?
- Just like all this stuff.

10:44.945 --> 10:48.081
- Oh! Well..
- 'Cause I decorated it myself.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.117
- I'm pretty proud of it.
- You're a player!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.284
- Mister!
- I guess so.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.953
Yeah, is that you?

10:52.986 --> 10:56.189
- That is, as a baby.
- Super baby boy, perhaps.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.392
- Probably, one year or older--
- Yeah. It's nice. Great!

10:59.426 --> 11:01.094
Thanks for showing me
your basement.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.897
- Thanks for coming by.
- Coming if there's a tornado.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.733
- We can hang out.
- Alright-y!

11:05.766 --> 11:07.768
- See you in the hospital.
- Get there safe.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.303
- See you, Chet.
- Alright. Enjoy your weekend.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.906
[singing continues]

11:15.976 --> 11:17.945
I am not afraid
of any ghosts.
