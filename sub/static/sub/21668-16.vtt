(Announcer) Previously on
<i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.862 --> 00:03.562
<i>Let's go guys.</i>

00:03.631 --> 00:06.665
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay tested
the final four at the pass.

00:06.742 --> 00:08.310
Tommy, talk to me.

00:08.377 --> 00:10.444
Don't interrupt me and I'll
[Bleep] tell you.

00:10.512 --> 00:11.679
Can you take that back and give
me a beef and not a lamb?

00:11.746 --> 00:13.347
Good. Well spotted.

00:13.415 --> 00:16.350
It looks like it's been chewed
by your dog.

00:16.418 --> 00:18.019
(Announcer) And while Tommy
worked on convincing himself

00:18.086 --> 00:19.753
he did well enough...

00:19.822 --> 00:22.656
I don't think I did bad.
Do you think I did that bad?

00:22.724 --> 00:24.792
Tough crowd.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.960
(Announcer) Elise was sure she did
enough to make it to the final two.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.995
Elise, I got respect for you

00:29.063 --> 00:31.264
because you're a tough chick,
and you want what you want.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.200
He feels that I did a good
enough job tonight

00:33.267 --> 00:35.368
to make it to the finals,
and he's scared.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.438
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay
knew who his final two were,

00:38.505 --> 00:40.307
and eliminated...
Tommy.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.041
Bang-up job, kid.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.775
(Announcer) And...
Elise, you know what,

00:43.844 --> 00:46.178
keep your jacket.
You deserve it.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.981
(Announcer) Tonight, the matchup
we've all been waiting for.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.450
It's totally 100% game on.

00:51.517 --> 00:53.719
From the beginning, Paul's
passion defined him.

00:53.786 --> 00:56.388
Hustle! I'm tired of
getting my ass kicked!

00:56.456 --> 00:58.356
(Announcer) And despite
some early setbacks...

00:58.423 --> 01:00.058
You, office.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.493
[Bleep].
It's embarrassing!

01:02.561 --> 01:04.762
(Announcer)
Paul only got stronger...

01:04.830 --> 01:06.231
You win the challenge.
Congratulations, well done.

01:06.298 --> 01:07.465
Thank you, chef.

01:07.532 --> 01:09.700
Dominating the last two
individual challenges.

01:09.768 --> 01:11.602
Yes!
Bloody spot on. Well done.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.670
Yes! Awesome.

01:13.738 --> 01:16.273
(Announcer) Will established himself
as the one to beat early on.

01:16.341 --> 01:17.975
That is delicious,
great job.

01:18.042 --> 01:19.076
I don't worry about somebody
eating my food.

01:19.143 --> 01:20.777
I do it, and I do it right.

01:20.845 --> 01:22.079
(Announcer)
And he continued to shine...

01:22.146 --> 01:24.147
You've cooked the burger,
perfect.

01:24.215 --> 01:27.150
(Announcer) All season long.
Oh, my gosh. Delish.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.718
Will, you win the challenge.

01:28.786 --> 01:31.954
Well done, brother.
Scores, please.

01:32.022 --> 01:34.290
(Gordon) Wow, an almost perfect score.
Will, great job.

01:34.358 --> 01:36.792
I said it from day one,
and I'll say it now...

01:36.860 --> 01:38.727
The only one
that can beat me is me.

01:38.795 --> 01:40.396
(Announcer)
Two worthy competitors...

01:40.463 --> 01:41.730
Come on, guys!

01:41.798 --> 01:43.199
(Announcer)
Put it all on the line.

01:43.267 --> 01:45.666
This one's [Bleep] raw.
Oh, [Bleep] me.

01:45.734 --> 01:48.403
(Announcer) Who will triumph...
Talk to your brigade.

01:48.470 --> 01:50.571
(Announcer) And become the head
chef of BLT Steak in New York...

01:50.639 --> 01:53.275

03:07.178 --> 03:09.912
Okay, both of you,
listen very carefully.

03:09.981 --> 03:13.316
Your biggest service
is yet to come.

03:13.384 --> 03:14.750
(Both)
Yes, chef.

03:14.818 --> 03:16.453
(Gordon)
Start thinking about the menus...

03:16.520 --> 03:19.356
The magic that you want
to really show off.

03:19.423 --> 03:21.923
Go upstairs and get to work
with those menus.

03:21.992 --> 03:23.825
Yes, chef.

03:23.893 --> 03:25.260
Great job.

03:25.328 --> 03:28.030
Don't worry, Will, you can
always be my sous chef.

03:28.098 --> 03:32.267
Yeah. Here comes big Will.

03:32.335 --> 03:34.370
Ah! You know, like,
people say

03:34.437 --> 03:36.571
it's not real unless
you can touch it, man?

03:36.639 --> 03:38.906
Well, I can [Bleep] touch it,
dude... I can touch it all.

03:38.974 --> 03:41.242
Oh, [Bleep].

03:41.310 --> 03:43.644
I told you y'all!
You all didn't believe me.

03:43.712 --> 03:46.647
Pauly the big [Bleep] deal!
Pauly, final two.

03:46.715 --> 03:49.283
To the experience,
to the journey,

03:49.351 --> 03:50.885
and to what is to come.

03:50.952 --> 03:52.920
(Announcer)
After a brief celebration,

03:52.988 --> 03:55.088
the finalists work late
into the night

03:55.156 --> 03:57.991
planning their menus
for the final dinner service.

03:58.059 --> 03:59.692
(Paul)
I'm in the final two.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.529
I'm one service away
from completing my goal

04:02.596 --> 04:04.464
to becoming a chef
in New York City,

04:04.532 --> 04:06.433
and it just makes me think
of my mom.

04:06.501 --> 04:09.535
My mom passed just a few months
before I came out here.

04:09.602 --> 04:11.637
I know that she's proud of me.

04:11.704 --> 04:14.006
She's watching how far I've
gotten on this thing.

04:14.074 --> 04:16.308
I'm not letting myself down.
I'm not letting my mom down.

04:16.375 --> 04:19.745
I'm not letting anyone down.
I'm gonna win this.

04:19.812 --> 04:22.014
(Will) I wanna win so badly,
man, it's not even funny,

04:22.082 --> 04:24.183
because this is what
I was born to do.

04:24.251 --> 04:26.217
I am the epitome of what chef
Ramsay is looking for in a chef.

04:26.285 --> 04:28.920
And I will do everything
in my [Bleep] damn power

04:28.987 --> 04:30.922
to make sure that
I can [Bleep] win.

04:35.528 --> 04:37.828
(Announcer) With the work
on their menus completed,

04:37.896 --> 04:40.131
the finalists spend the morning
reviewing their master plan

04:40.199 --> 04:41.998
with the sous chefs.

04:42.067 --> 04:44.435
Toasted pecans with a sunny quail egg.
<i>Sounds amazing.</i>

04:44.502 --> 04:45.769
Branzini. We're gonna
cut it the same way

04:45.836 --> 04:46.937
that we did before.

04:47.004 --> 04:48.272
The one fillet,
we'll cut it in half.

04:48.339 --> 04:50.107
Talking about old school.
Yeah.

04:50.175 --> 04:52.509
(Announcer) And they spend the
afternoon refining their dishes

04:52.577 --> 04:54.445
for the most important dinner
service of their lives.

04:54.512 --> 04:56.012
(Gordon) How are you, Will?
Come here, quickly.

04:56.081 --> 04:58.948
Paul, come here, quickly.

04:59.015 --> 05:03.219
Okay...I think right now that
both of you need to relax

05:03.287 --> 05:04.820
and de-stress.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.790
So, I'm gonna take you both
out for dinner.

05:07.857 --> 05:09.792
(Paul)
Awesome.

05:09.859 --> 05:12.795
There's a limo waiting for you outside.
Hurry up. Thank you, chef.

05:12.862 --> 05:14.729
(Announcer)
Excited about the opportunity

05:14.797 --> 05:16.631
to get a break
from the intense preparation,

05:16.699 --> 05:19.000
Paul and Will quickly change

05:19.068 --> 05:22.670
for an evening out
with chef Ramsay.

05:22.738 --> 05:24.573
Gentlemen, congratulations.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.775
<i>Your limousines are waiting</i>
<i>for you. Will...</i>

05:27.843 --> 05:30.411
Thank you very much.
Holy [Bleep].

05:30.479 --> 05:34.482
[Indistinct]

05:34.549 --> 05:36.817
I open the [Bleep] limo,
and it's my mom and my wife.

05:36.884 --> 05:39.220
I'm shocked, I'm in awe.
I don't really know what to say.

05:39.287 --> 05:42.089
Hey, Paul.
Congratulations.

05:42.157 --> 05:43.424
Let's get out of here.
Let's do this.

05:43.492 --> 05:44.492
Let's get out of here.

05:44.559 --> 05:45.958
(Will)
Thank you, James.

05:51.932 --> 05:54.501
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>welcome to Belasco.</i>

05:54.568 --> 05:56.603
Thank you very much, chef.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.571
(Gordon) I got here a little
early to check out the table.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.240
You didn't expect this,
did you?

06:00.307 --> 06:02.007
No, chef.
The chef's out of New York.

06:02.074 --> 06:04.276
They opened up, literally,
four weeks ago.

06:04.344 --> 06:07.312
Really? <i>So he's put together</i>
<i>the most amazing menu.</i>

06:07.380 --> 06:09.548
Would you like to say hello?
Yes, we'd love to.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.850
When chef Ramsay was, like,
"let's go to the kitchen,"

06:11.917 --> 06:12.784
I'm like, "all right, cool.
Let's go look at the kitchen.

06:12.852 --> 06:13.652
Let's go meet another chef."

06:13.719 --> 06:15.521
I'm really excited about this.

06:15.588 --> 06:17.022
(Gordon) So this chef
is dying to meet you,

06:17.089 --> 06:20.591
and the kitchen is unique.

06:20.659 --> 06:27.665
[Cheers and applause]

06:27.732 --> 06:31.469
Holy [Bleep].
This ain't no kitchen.

06:31.537 --> 06:34.003
Holy [Bleep],
I have arrived.

06:34.071 --> 06:36.072
There's cute girls everywhere
in that crowd.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.142
I feel like
a culinary rock star.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.010
Do you remember when I told you
that you weren't stars?

06:41.078 --> 06:42.312
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.913
Now, you are.
Enjoy the moment.

06:43.981 --> 06:46.650
Come on.
Come on.

06:46.717 --> 06:48.318
[Cheers and applause]

06:48.386 --> 06:52.221
And now it's time
for your final challenge.

06:52.289 --> 06:55.324
You'll have one hour to prepare
five stunning dishes

06:55.392 --> 06:57.859
that could be on the menu
at BLT Steak.

06:57.927 --> 06:59.094
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

06:59.162 --> 07:00.563
And your time starts now.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.764
Off you go.
I wish you luck.

07:02.832 --> 07:05.233
We're gonna cook five plates
in one hour.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.669
The only thing in my mind is,
"what am I gonna make?"

07:07.736 --> 07:10.305
(Gordon) Let's go, Will and Paul.
Both: Yes, chef.

07:10.372 --> 07:12.106
(Announcer) For this final challenge,
Will and Paul must create

07:12.174 --> 07:14.576
their unique take
on five types of dishes

07:14.643 --> 07:16.544
that could appear
on the BLT menu...

07:16.612 --> 07:20.415
A seafood appetizer, a salad,
a seafood entree,

07:20.482 --> 07:22.849
a bone-in rib eye,
and a filet of beef.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.585
Gotta go big or go home.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.521
I feel my dishes will
impress the judges.

07:27.589 --> 07:29.956
They are the things that
I'm very comfortable doing.

07:30.024 --> 07:32.192
They're a reflection of how I
cook... very clean, very sleek.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.228
Awesome.

07:34.295 --> 07:36.096
30 minutes to go.
Yes, chef.

07:36.163 --> 07:38.831
[Cheers and applause]
Way to go, Paul.

07:38.898 --> 07:43.536
Whoo! Go, Will!

07:43.604 --> 07:44.970
Under control, Will?
Yes, chef.

07:45.038 --> 07:46.339
I'm not a safe guy.

07:46.406 --> 07:47.740
I try not to play life
in a safe way.

07:47.807 --> 07:49.242
These beets,
you're gonna peel them.

07:49.309 --> 07:50.710
Yeah.
Quarter them out.

07:50.777 --> 07:52.445
(Will)
I tried to make every dish

07:52.512 --> 07:54.011
untraditional
and unconventional.

07:54.079 --> 07:55.413
Does that not look
like pepto?

07:55.481 --> 07:57.081
No, it looks hot.

07:57.149 --> 07:59.618
That's just my style,
you know what I'm saying?

07:59.685 --> 08:01.119
We'll start plating up,
please, yes?

08:01.186 --> 08:02.787
15 seconds to go.

08:02.855 --> 08:04.756
Crowd: Will. Will. Will...
Paul. Paul. Paul...

08:04.823 --> 08:06.124
Let me check.
Is it at the pass? Okay.

08:06.191 --> 08:08.960
Chopped cilantro,
lemon zest, lemon juice.

08:09.027 --> 08:16.467
Five, four, three,
two, one, and stop.

08:16.534 --> 08:19.970
[Cheers and applause]

08:20.037 --> 08:21.538

08:21.606 --> 08:25.708
we have five very, very
notable judges.

08:54.003 --> 08:55.570
This is very well done.
Thank you.

08:55.638 --> 08:56.805
The mussels are clean,
really nice.

08:56.872 --> 08:58.539
I think this is a very well
executed dish.

08:58.607 --> 09:01.108
Thank you, chef.
[Cheers and applause]

09:01.176 --> 09:03.110
Will, please, present your dish
to Victor, thank you.

09:03.178 --> 09:05.112
I wanted to keep it
on the lighter side.

09:05.180 --> 09:07.515
<i>I did seared scallops</i>
<i>on a charred corn salad</i>

09:07.582 --> 09:10.484
with a corn puree and micro cilantro.
Oh, wow.

09:10.552 --> 09:11.852
Well, these are really
well prepared.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.353
You have a nice sear on it.

09:13.421 --> 09:15.422
The vibrance of the citrus
really accents sweetness

09:15.489 --> 09:17.824
of the scallops
very, very nicely.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.494
(Gordon) Would you prefer Will's
dish or Paul's dish, Victor, please?

09:21.562 --> 09:23.296
Um, I think...

09:23.363 --> 09:26.031
[Cheers and applause]

09:26.098 --> 09:27.533
I'm gonna have to go
with the scallops.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.134
(Gordon)
With Will.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.670
[Cheers and applause]

09:31.738 --> 09:33.739
Please welcome
the executive chef

09:33.807 --> 09:36.809
at BLT, Los Angeles,
chef Brian Moyers.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.344
Nice to see you, chef.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.077
(Announcer)
Will has the early lead,

09:40.145 --> 09:42.079
and it's now time
for the salad round.

09:42.147 --> 09:45.383
Chef Moyers will be deciding
between Will's beet salad

09:45.451 --> 09:46.818
with champagne vinaigrette...

09:46.885 --> 09:48.419
Beets are cooked well.

09:48.487 --> 09:51.188
Could use a little bit
more acid, but very nice.

09:51.256 --> 09:53.991
(Announcer) Or Paul's mixed
Greens over roasted potatoes?

09:54.059 --> 09:56.693
Balanced very well.
I love the cheese.

09:56.761 --> 09:58.294
I love the vinegar.

09:58.363 --> 10:00.530
It's good salad.
Good salad. Thank you.

10:00.598 --> 10:02.566
Brian, which one would you
choose Will or Paul's?

10:02.633 --> 10:05.001
[Audience shouting]

10:05.069 --> 10:06.603
The choice is yours.

10:06.671 --> 10:07.971
I'm gonna have to go
with you, Paul.

10:08.038 --> 10:09.105
Thank you.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.040
[Cheers and applause]

10:11.108 --> 10:12.641
(Gordon) All tied up.
One to Paul and one to Will.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.610
Brilliant.

10:14.678 --> 10:17.279
(Announcer) Judging the fish
entrees will be Johan Svensson...

10:17.347 --> 10:18.881
Good to see you.

10:18.948 --> 10:21.751
Chef de cuisine from BLT,
Honolulu.

10:21.818 --> 10:23.986
He will choose between
Will's Dover sole...

10:24.053 --> 10:26.154
I would have cooked the fish
a little bit less,

10:26.222 --> 10:28.256
but in all, it's...
It's pretty good.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.891
(Announcer)
And Paul's branzini.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.693
It's crunchy.
I like things crunchy,

10:31.761 --> 10:33.595
but maybe a little bit softer,
so you sort to get

10:33.662 --> 10:35.296
the flavors coming out.
Tough decision.

10:35.364 --> 10:37.899
Do you prefer
Paul's or Will's?

10:37.966 --> 10:40.635
[Audience shouting]

10:40.703 --> 10:42.069
I think I'm going
with chef Paul.

10:42.137 --> 10:43.970
Thank you.

10:44.038 --> 10:47.073
That's two for Paul
and one for Will.

10:47.141 --> 10:50.143
It's time to move on to
the all-important meat round.

10:50.211 --> 10:53.914
Please welcome the executive
chef of BLT New York,

10:53.981 --> 10:55.849
Cliff crooks.
Thank you very much.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.151
[Cheers and applause]

10:58.219 --> 11:00.853
(Announcer) With Paul only one point
away from winning the challenge,

11:00.921 --> 11:03.423
he hopes to score with his
pan-roasted rib eye

11:03.490 --> 11:04.791
with buttermilk puree.

11:04.858 --> 11:05.858
(Gordon)
Cliff, what do you think?

11:05.926 --> 11:07.293
Extremely eye-appealing.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.062
Seasoning could use
a touch more salt and pepper.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.197
Other than that, very good.

11:12.265 --> 11:13.833
And Will, please.

11:13.901 --> 11:15.901
(Announcer)
With the challenge on the line,

11:15.968 --> 11:18.403
Will needs his grilled rib eye
with gruyere cheese

11:18.471 --> 11:20.004
to impress,
in order to stay alive.

11:23.543 --> 11:25.209
[Cheers and applause]

11:25.277 --> 11:28.379
The seasoning is dead on.
It's not over-sauced.

11:28.448 --> 11:31.082
It's spot-on. Spot-on.
<i>Spot-on.</i>

11:31.150 --> 11:33.183
Wow, well, Cliff, you've got
a very tough choice. Yeah.

11:33.251 --> 11:35.419
Will's, in front of you,
or Paul's?

11:35.487 --> 11:41.158
[Audience shouting]

11:41.225 --> 11:43.360
I'm gonna go with Will's.
<i>Will...</i>

11:43.428 --> 11:46.464
[Cheers and applause]

11:46.531 --> 11:50.199
Wow. We are all tied up
two to two. Well done.

11:50.267 --> 11:51.801
[Cheers and applause]

11:51.869 --> 11:53.570
Please welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

11:53.637 --> 11:55.772
the president of BLT,
Keith Treyball.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
[Cheers and applause]

11:56.907 --> 11:58.475
Nice to see you, chef.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.276
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, my pleasure.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.512
It is 100% the most important
thing to impress Keith.

12:03.580 --> 12:07.583
This is the boss of the bosses
that will be the bosses of me.

12:07.650 --> 12:09.017
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Paul, please.</i>

12:09.085 --> 12:11.252
This is my play
on a steak frites.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.755
<i>I did a pan-roasted filet</i>
<i>mignon with a braised endive</i>

12:13.823 --> 12:15.457
<i>and a truffle potato fries.</i>

12:15.525 --> 12:17.559
Mm, this is superb.

12:17.627 --> 12:20.761
Not overdone with the truffle,
great balance. Really well done.

12:20.829 --> 12:22.463
Thank you.

12:22.531 --> 12:24.832
The flavors were there,
the plating on it was beautiful.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.969
I mean, he's got to love it,
right?

12:28.036 --> 12:30.004
Please, Will, explain your dish
to Keith, thank you.

12:30.071 --> 12:32.172
<i>I did a grilled</i>
<i>filet mignon</i>

12:32.240 --> 12:34.308
that I served with buttered
brussels sprouts,

12:34.376 --> 12:36.009
a black truffle
and potato puree,

12:36.076 --> 12:38.979
and a red grape jus.

12:39.046 --> 12:40.680
It took a set of [Bleep]
to put grapes on that plate.

12:40.748 --> 12:43.349
I'm just hoping that he gets it.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.720
Perfect brussels sprouts.
Thank you, chef.

12:46.787 --> 12:49.990
I have to say, both of these
dishes are excellent.

12:50.057 --> 12:53.392
Is it Will, or is it Paul,
please?

12:53.459 --> 12:55.528
[Cheers and applause]

13:03.482 --> 13:04.983
[Cheers and applause]

13:05.050 --> 13:06.384
(Announcer)
It's the final challenge.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.885
And in front of
a packed theater,

13:07.953 --> 13:10.588
Will and Paul are all tied up,

13:10.655 --> 13:12.522
and it all comes down
to the filet.

13:12.590 --> 13:15.959
And that will be judged
by the president of BLT Steak.

13:16.027 --> 13:18.996
I have to say, both of these
dishes are excellent.

13:19.063 --> 13:22.432
Is it Will
or is it Paul, please?

13:22.500 --> 13:26.636
[Cheers and applause]

13:26.704 --> 13:28.237
I gotta go with Will.
Will.

13:28.305 --> 13:31.740
[Cheers and applause]

13:31.808 --> 13:34.643
Come on. Yeah!

13:34.711 --> 13:39.515
Representing not only myself,
but my entire family, baby,

13:39.582 --> 13:41.217
was probably one of the greatest
feelings I've ever experienced

13:41.284 --> 13:42.751
in my entire life.

13:42.819 --> 13:45.320
Really, I gotta tell you,
bold move with those grapes.

13:45.388 --> 13:47.389
<i>Bold move.</i>

13:47.456 --> 13:49.690
[Cheers and applause]

13:49.758 --> 13:51.659
Okay, Will and Paul,
great job.

13:51.727 --> 13:53.828
<i>Will, congratulations.</i>
Thank you, chef.

13:53.896 --> 13:56.498
I'd like you both now to head
back to Hell's Kitchen, please.

13:56.565 --> 13:58.166
I'm not worried.
I'm not shaking.

13:58.234 --> 14:00.267
I didn't go out like a punk.

14:00.335 --> 14:02.169
And I'm gonna win
the service tomorrow.

14:02.237 --> 14:03.404
I'm gonna be the next chef
at BLT Steak.

14:03.471 --> 14:07.908
[Cheers and applause]

14:07.975 --> 14:09.510
(Announcer) When the finalists
arrive back at Hell's Kitchen...

14:09.577 --> 14:10.944
Hi, guys.

14:11.012 --> 14:13.380
(Paul) That's a
very large present.

14:13.448 --> 14:16.115
(Announcer) They are greeted by
another surprise from chef Ramsay.

14:16.183 --> 14:17.283
Open it.
I wanna see what it is.

14:17.351 --> 14:18.717
One, two, three.

14:18.785 --> 14:21.987
[Cheers]

14:22.056 --> 14:23.889
Oh, that's Tommy's ass!

14:23.957 --> 14:28.528
All the past contestants
and Tommy's ass.

14:28.595 --> 14:29.862
I was definitely happy
to see both of them.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.297
Congratulations.

14:31.365 --> 14:34.166
They were my prediction
come true, by the way.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.834
Will and Paul, I see you
received my final gift.

14:36.902 --> 14:38.370
Both: Yes, chef.

14:38.438 --> 14:40.038
Welcome back, guys.
All: Thank you, chef.

14:40.106 --> 14:43.007
I am like a big present.

14:43.076 --> 14:46.978
This pick is critical.

14:47.046 --> 14:48.912
<i>You know their strengths,</i>
<i>their weaknesses.</i>

14:48.980 --> 14:50.981
Think strategy.

14:51.049 --> 14:52.916
<i>Who's going to work well</i>
<i>together,</i>

14:52.984 --> 14:55.186
<i>who's going to have your back</i>

14:55.253 --> 14:59.356
on the most important dinner
service of your entire lives?

14:59.424 --> 15:01.825
<i>Will, on the back</i>
<i>of that win,</i>

15:01.893 --> 15:05.395
you get the first pick.

15:05.463 --> 15:09.999
On my last page, there's a list
of the eight competitors

15:10.067 --> 15:11.934
we have here
with a ranking order.

15:12.002 --> 15:13.736
I knew exactly who I wanted
from the beginning.

15:13.804 --> 15:15.205
First pick,
I'm going to pick Tommy.

15:15.272 --> 15:16.005
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Tommy.</i>

15:16.073 --> 15:17.474
Number one draft, baby!

15:17.541 --> 15:19.275
I'm not going to say
I'm surprised.

15:19.343 --> 15:21.276
I knew I'd be number one pick.

15:21.344 --> 15:22.611
Let's get this man some money.

15:22.678 --> 15:24.713
<i>Paul, your first pick?</i>

15:24.780 --> 15:26.515
Come on, Elise.

15:26.583 --> 15:28.383
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Elise.</i> Thank you.

15:28.451 --> 15:29.918
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

15:29.986 --> 15:32.221
Paul feels confident
in my ability. He should.

15:32.288 --> 15:34.856
I wouldn't have made that choice
first, but whatever.

15:34.924 --> 15:37.558
Will, second pick.
Natalie.

15:37.626 --> 15:39.827
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Natalie, wow.</i>

15:39.894 --> 15:41.996
Paul, second choice?
Elizabeth.

15:42.063 --> 15:43.264
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

15:43.332 --> 15:46.767
I did leave pretty angry.

15:46.835 --> 15:48.035
You better hope
I [Bleep] go home.

15:49.771 --> 15:54.608
But I never thought in a million
years Paul wouldn't pick me.

15:54.675 --> 15:56.143
Hey, girl!

15:56.210 --> 15:58.445
Are you going
all-girl, Paul or...

15:58.513 --> 16:00.947
Just picking my strengths.

16:01.015 --> 16:03.750
Will, who's it going to be?

16:03.817 --> 16:06.253
Jenny socks.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.287
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Wow, Jennifer.
</i> <i>Great choice.</i>

16:08.355 --> 16:12.491
Smart. If Paul was smart,
he would have picked me.

16:12.559 --> 16:15.994
But I am very excited
that I am not on Elise's team.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.831
Paul, the third choice?

16:19.899 --> 16:21.167
Come on, Jonathan.

16:21.234 --> 16:23.169
<i>Jonathan.</i>
<i>Jonathan.</i>

16:23.236 --> 16:27.772
Will, you're choosing
between Carrie and Krupa.

16:31.009 --> 16:32.809
Yes, yes.

16:32.877 --> 16:34.378
I know that Krupa
might not be the best,

16:34.445 --> 16:36.846
but I saw Elise on Paul's team,

16:36.914 --> 16:39.115
and I saw Carrie's still
waiting to be picked,

16:39.184 --> 16:40.317
so I was, like, I'm going to
put the two of them together

16:40.385 --> 16:42.018
and hope for some fireworks.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.454
Krupa!

16:44.522 --> 16:46.156
You son of a bitch.

16:46.224 --> 16:48.891
You better get out of my face.
Hold up, I'm talking.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.827
I'm tired of hearing you talk.
Oh, let's toast to not liking each other.

16:51.895 --> 16:54.297
Come on, Carrie.
Oh, thanks Paul, I appreciate it.

16:54.364 --> 16:55.964
I didn't like Carrie yesterday,

16:56.032 --> 16:57.833
I didn't her the week
before that,

16:57.901 --> 16:59.368
and I sure don't like her today.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.805
Elise and Carrie.
[Bleep] Me.

17:02.872 --> 17:04.705
Pauly is [Bleep].

17:04.772 --> 17:06.374
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Okay, get
back up</i> <i>to the dorm</i>

17:06.442 --> 17:09.310
<i>and start briefing</i>
<i>your teams.</i>

17:09.377 --> 17:12.580
Good luck.
Off you go, guys.

17:12.647 --> 17:14.115
I'm not totally thrilled about
Elise and Carrie

17:14.183 --> 17:15.782
being on the same team

17:15.851 --> 17:17.952
but I'm going to make the best
out of what I got.

17:18.020 --> 17:21.521
Before this goes any further,
all right, if you two fight,

17:21.589 --> 17:24.258
I'm going to put my foot
so far up to your [Bleep],

17:24.326 --> 17:26.359
I'll wiggle my toes,
your ears are gonna move

17:26.428 --> 17:27.728
and that's both of you.
I'm not going to fight with her.

17:27.795 --> 17:29.597
I'm just saying...
I love you both.

17:29.664 --> 17:31.498
I am looking
to draw some blood

17:31.566 --> 17:33.334
when it comes to this next
dinner service for Paul,

17:33.401 --> 17:35.168
and that includes beating
Carrie's ass

17:35.237 --> 17:36.869
after we get out of service,
if I have to.

17:36.937 --> 17:38.471
I got your back.

17:38.539 --> 17:40.473
I picked the strongest team.
I know who I want.

17:40.541 --> 17:42.475
I got oil and vinegar.
I got matches and dynamite.

17:42.543 --> 17:44.444
I'll be honest with you,
I really don't know

17:44.511 --> 17:46.346
how tomorrow's going to go.
It's going to go fine.

17:46.380 --> 17:48.414
<i>Anything that's not</i>
<i>self explanatory,</i>

17:48.449 --> 17:50.350
I'm just going to text no
you know what I'm saying??

17:50.417 --> 17:51.817
<i>So let's start on apps first.</i>

17:51.918 --> 17:54.686
Spicy grild quail.

17:54.721 --> 17:57.456
I'm m going show you exactly
how it's gonna broken down.

17:57.523 --> 17:59.157
I need a strong start,

17:59.225 --> 18:01.360
and I feel that you can give me
a strong start.

18:01.427 --> 18:02.827
I can give you a strong start,
but I'm better off working meat.

18:02.895 --> 18:04.529
I know that.

18:04.597 --> 18:06.632
But if you wanted to
work apps, I'll work apps.

18:06.699 --> 18:08.432
I want you to work apps,
because that way,

18:08.500 --> 18:09.734
when you're done with apps...
I can help whoever.

18:11.137 --> 18:14.740
You're going to have, like,
a wing and a wing.

18:14.808 --> 18:17.109
[Laughter]
Oh, God.

18:17.210 --> 18:20.112
Will drew a puncture of quail,
and it looks like a vagina.

18:20.146 --> 18:21.880
Okay.
Are those boobs?

18:21.948 --> 18:23.181
[Laughter]

18:23.282 --> 18:25.084
(Jennifer)
Then Will draws a picture

18:25.151 --> 18:28.052
of the thigh and leg,
and it looks like a penis.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.154
That is a leg
and a thigh.

18:30.255 --> 18:31.756
Leg and thig.

18:31.824 --> 18:35.860
So I'm guessing Will is
very horny right now,

18:35.928 --> 18:37.895
and he needs to get out
of Hell's Kitchen.

18:37.963 --> 18:40.765
Those look like a penis
and a big set of [Bleep].

18:40.833 --> 18:42.633
I apologize immensely
for the way I draw.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.839
(Announcer) After a late night
preparing their teams for a battle...

18:46.907 --> 18:48.508
Hi, chef.
Hey.

18:48.575 --> 18:50.743
(Announcer) Will and Paul
hit the kitchen early

18:50.811 --> 18:53.078
to prepare for the biggest
dinner service of their lives.

18:53.146 --> 18:54.480
(Will) All right, everybody knows
what they got to do right?

18:54.548 --> 18:55.782
Yup.

18:55.849 --> 18:57.416
You want the pecans
toasted whole, right?

18:57.483 --> 18:59.150
<i>(Will)</i>
<i>Oh, no, I don't.</i>

18:59.218 --> 19:01.219
If I had any concern right now,
my only concern would be Krupa.

19:01.287 --> 19:02.621
Oh, boiling over.
[Bleep].

19:02.688 --> 19:03.988
Krupa is the only person
in this kitchen

19:04.056 --> 19:05.457
I've never worked with.

19:05.525 --> 19:06.691
Way too dark.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.259
Too dark?
Way too dark.

19:08.327 --> 19:10.862
But it's my job to lead,
so I will lead.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.596
Take a handful of those leeks,

19:12.664 --> 19:14.097
blanch 'em in the hot water,
shake them off.

19:14.165 --> 19:15.900
This is the most important day
in my life.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.802
Guys please [Bleep] hustle
for me, please.

19:17.869 --> 19:21.939
I cannot fail tonight.
I cannot go subpar.

19:22.006 --> 19:24.475
I'm gonna lead my team to
victory the way that I know how.

19:24.543 --> 19:26.610
(Announcer) It's only an
hour before dinner service,

19:26.678 --> 19:28.178
and while chef Ramsay may be

19:28.246 --> 19:29.779
confident in his two
finalists...

19:29.847 --> 19:31.380
Right.Will, let's go.

19:31.449 --> 19:33.316
(Announcer)
He still needs to make sure

19:33.383 --> 19:35.251
that all of the dishes are
up to his high standards.

19:35.319 --> 19:37.086
Cheese-filled gnudi with
a little shaved black truffle,

19:37.154 --> 19:41.123
parmesan broth
and pea Greens.

19:41.191 --> 19:42.759
It's delicious.
Really good indeed.

19:42.827 --> 19:44.660
<i>Next.</i>
Spice-seared scallops.

19:44.727 --> 19:48.229
Mm-hmm.
Mm. Really good.

19:48.297 --> 19:50.833
(Will)
I'm so confident in my menu.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.734
Nobody in this world can tell me
that that menu is not good.

19:52.802 --> 19:53.902
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:53.970 --> 19:55.604
<i>Good start.</i>
Thank you.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.272
Definitely, Paul needs
to be worried.

19:57.340 --> 19:58.874
Talk me through the menu.

19:58.942 --> 19:59.942
This is my garlic olive oil
poached shrimp.

20:00.009 --> 20:01.509
It looks great.

20:01.543 --> 20:05.179
Roasted garlic,
some jalapeno, lemons.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.146
Nice.
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

20:06.214 --> 20:07.381
Nice, nice, nice.

20:07.449 --> 20:08.215
It tastes amazing.
Thank you, chef.

20:08.283 --> 20:09.350
Yeah. Next.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.687
This my heirloom tomato
carpaccio.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.623
Well it looks a mess.
No. I'm sorry.

20:15.691 --> 20:18.859
I've seen plates that have
come back with more tomatoes on

20:18.926 --> 20:20.927
in Hell's Kitchen.

20:20.995 --> 20:22.562
And that's going out.
Yes, chef.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.598
Yeah? And this is...

20:24.665 --> 20:26.466
Grilled swordfish, chef,

20:26.534 --> 20:28.134
<i>with broccoli rabe,</i>
<i>yellow romanesca,</i>

20:28.202 --> 20:30.837
<i>and a crab-stuffed tomato.</i>

20:30.905 --> 20:34.707
That needs work, urgently.
Just, dense boring crab meat.

20:37.677 --> 20:39.879
I told my team
exactly what to do,

20:39.946 --> 20:43.015
but I didn't taste them,
and it really [Bleep] right now.

20:43.082 --> 20:44.783
You've got some serious work
to do there.

20:44.851 --> 20:50.087
[Bleep].
I gotta get out of here.

20:50.155 --> 20:52.223
Uh!
Oh, [Bleep]

20:52.290 --> 20:54.191
<i>(Elise)</i>
<i>Where you going?</i>

20:57.061 --> 20:58.862
(Announcer)
It's less than an hour

20:58.929 --> 21:00.364
until the final dinner service
in Hell's Kitchen,

21:00.431 --> 21:02.732
and the test run of Paul's menu
has chef Ramsay

21:02.799 --> 21:04.334
demanding of few upgrades.

21:04.402 --> 21:05.736
You've got some serious work
to do there.

21:05.803 --> 21:09.204
[Bleep].

21:09.273 --> 21:11.340
I got to get out of here.
Paul!

21:11.408 --> 21:15.278
I want this not just for myself,
but I want this for my mom.

21:15.345 --> 21:19.582
I promised my mom that I was
going to win before she died.

21:26.555 --> 21:29.190
Just give me a second.

21:31.860 --> 21:33.728
I just want to her proud.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.461
Even though she's not here,
she's here in spirit.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.229
She's with me always,

21:39.297 --> 21:40.597
and she's going to be
in the dining room tonight.

21:42.499 --> 21:46.036
Guys, up to the pass now,
please.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.706
Whatever you guys had inside
of you that got you guys here,

21:49.774 --> 21:51.307
I want it tonight.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.242
Good luck. Let's have
a good service, y'all.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.678
Good service, good service.

21:55.745 --> 21:57.412
I'm not doing this
for my pride.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.347
I'm not doing this
for [Bleep] fame.

21:59.415 --> 22:02.051
I am doing this because
I made a promise to my mom

22:02.118 --> 22:04.252
before she died
that I was going to win this.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.354
And I need you guys
to help me win this.

22:06.422 --> 22:08.423
All right. <i>(Elise)</i>
<i>You got it, Paul.</i>

22:08.491 --> 22:10.125
Let's go! <i>(Will)</i>
<i>Everybody ready to rock?</i>

22:10.193 --> 22:12.293
Yeah!
Let's go, boys and girls.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.595
I know. It's like,
let's do it.

22:13.662 --> 22:14.562
Tonight is the night, man.

22:14.630 --> 22:17.065
This, 100%, comes down to me.

22:17.132 --> 22:18.733
Tonight, I'm going to prove
to chef

22:18.801 --> 22:20.768
exactly why I am here,
and exactly why

22:20.836 --> 22:22.136
I will be hanging
on that wall.

22:22.204 --> 22:23.504
[Bleep] Go.

22:23.572 --> 22:25.372
Okay.
Let's go.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.374
I'm not going out without a
fight, I can tell you that much.

22:27.442 --> 22:28.842
James.
Yes, chef.

22:28.910 --> 22:29.776
Let's go.
Open Hell's Kitchen please.

22:29.844 --> 22:30.811
Yes, chef.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:40.554 --> 22:42.956
(Announcer) The doors have opened
for the final dinner service.

22:43.024 --> 22:44.991
To <i>Hell's Kitchen.</i>

22:45.058 --> 22:47.126
(Announcer) And with
$1/4 million on the line

22:47.193 --> 22:49.428
and vip guests filling
the dining room...

22:49.496 --> 22:50.930
Quite a lovely year.

22:50.998 --> 22:53.397
Both Will and Paul
are clearly ready

22:53.465 --> 22:55.566
to prove to chef Ramsay why
they're worthy of being

22:55.635 --> 22:57.102
the next head chef
at BLT state in New York.

22:57.169 --> 22:59.904
Order in.

22:59.972 --> 23:02.107
Let's go. Guy's this is it.
First table...

23:02.174 --> 23:04.943
Three risottos, one gnudi,
one quail, one scallops.

23:05.011 --> 23:06.377
Seven minutes.

23:06.445 --> 23:08.112
Seven minutes to the window.
Thank you.

23:08.179 --> 23:10.180
Natalie is strong on apps,
Natalie is a fighter,

23:10.248 --> 23:12.049
Natalie is a team player,
and she's my rock.

23:12.117 --> 23:14.251
You want me to fire up some
scallops here for you.

23:14.318 --> 23:15.919
No, I've got a pan
right here.

23:15.987 --> 23:17.521
This is Will's big night,
and, you know,

23:17.588 --> 23:19.156
I wasn't gonna
let him down.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.323
Can I do anything
for you, Natalie?

23:20.391 --> 23:22.826
No!
I'm gonna stop asking.

23:22.894 --> 23:24.794
(Announcer) While Will leans on
Natalie, over in the blue kitchen...

23:24.862 --> 23:26.495
Order !!

23:26.563 --> 23:28.564
(Announcer) Paul hopes Elise
can get appetizers off

23:28.632 --> 23:29.999
to a strong start.

23:30.067 --> 23:32.268
Appetizers... two shrimp,
two risottos.

23:32.335 --> 23:35.538
Entrees... two branzinis, two shrimp.
Yes, chef!

23:35.605 --> 23:38.074
Come on, you guys, I didn't
hear a "yes, chef!" Yes, chef!

23:38.142 --> 23:40.308
Guys, talk to me. How long?
Two shrimp, two risottos,

23:40.376 --> 23:42.277
give me six minutes.
Six minutes heard.

23:42.344 --> 23:43.979
I thought that it was going
to be hard for me

23:44.047 --> 23:45.480
to come back and help
somebody else win

23:45.548 --> 23:47.348
but I'm not bitter. Like,
I want to see the dude win.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.051
Walking with shrimp.

23:50.452 --> 23:52.420
Elise!
What?

23:52.488 --> 23:54.255
There's not supposed to be
any stock in there.

23:54.323 --> 23:56.190
Just start it again.

23:56.257 --> 23:58.292
I have to keep my cool.
I understand working with Elise,

23:58.359 --> 23:59.694
I cant...
I don't want to frazzle her.

23:59.761 --> 24:01.662
How could you cook
the shrimp wrong?

24:01.730 --> 24:03.330
I put splash of stock in it.
It was my bad.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.699
Come on, then.
Yes, chef.

24:04.766 --> 24:06.767
First table, and you're
cooking it wrong for him.

24:06.835 --> 24:09.970
Hurry up! Back to the stove.
Come on. We're live, we're live.

24:10.038 --> 24:13.372
In forty five seconds...
What the [Bleep].

24:13.440 --> 24:17.276
Let !!
Out of the [Bleep] way.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.846
Oh, my God. Really? Is it gonna
start out like this?

24:19.914 --> 24:21.647
You're a talented cook.
Yes, chef.

24:21.716 --> 24:23.783
Use your brain.
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

24:23.851 --> 24:26.319
(Announcer) While Elise starts
over on the first appetizers,

24:26.386 --> 24:29.088
over in Will's kitchen...
Gnudi coming to the window.

24:29.155 --> 24:30.856
(Announcer)
Natalie's first appetizers

24:30.924 --> 24:32.490
are already out
in the dining room...

24:32.558 --> 24:34.593
Oh, my God, it's so good.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.829
(Announcer) And are being
thoroughly enjoyed by customers.

24:36.896 --> 24:38.063
We got the right team.

24:38.131 --> 24:39.798
First entree, stand by...

24:39.866 --> 24:42.034
One Dover, one bass,
two New York strips.

24:42.102 --> 24:44.301
That means get one bass
from the oven.

24:44.369 --> 24:46.604
(Announcer) And Will is
focused on pushing food out.

24:46.671 --> 24:48.339
Why are they cooking up
the fish?

24:48.406 --> 24:49.707
I just told her to
put it in the oven

24:49.775 --> 24:51.242
to start getting it ready.

24:51.309 --> 24:52.810
I understand
where you're going,

24:52.878 --> 24:54.245
but they haven't even cleared
the [Bleep] plates.

24:54.312 --> 24:55.713
<i>It's not a race, sir.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

24:55.781 --> 24:58.449
They get food rammed down their
throat...I'm nervous.

24:58.516 --> 25:00.751
(Announcer) While chef
Ramsay tries to keep Will

25:00.818 --> 25:03.053
from jumping the gun on entrees,
over on the blue kitchen...

25:03.121 --> 25:05.021
Thank you.

25:05.089 --> 25:07.557
(Announcer) Paul is still struggling
to catch up on appetizers.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.826
[Bleep]. Liz, give me
a new scallop.

25:09.894 --> 25:11.962
These are overcooked.
Make it quick.

25:12.029 --> 25:13.797
It's going with the risotto, please.
Okay.

25:13.865 --> 25:15.431
Hurry up. Hurry up.

25:15.499 --> 25:17.199
Come on, Liz, I don't want
my risotto dying.

25:17.267 --> 25:19.334
What the hell is
going on over here?

25:19.402 --> 25:21.971
I don't know if it was a blonde
moment or a dumb moment,

25:22.038 --> 25:25.007
it was just an Elizabeth moment.

25:25.075 --> 25:26.675
Scallops, how long?
Yes, I'm walking one right now.

25:27.911 --> 25:31.280
Thank you.

25:31.347 --> 25:34.215
Liz, Liz, it's undercooked.
Oh, my [Bleep].

25:34.283 --> 25:36.550
Throw it in the oven for another minute.
Yes, chef.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.586
(Announcer) It's 45 minutes
into dinner service,

25:38.654 --> 25:40.755
and while Elizabeth tries to
recover on the fish station,

25:40.823 --> 25:42.523
over in the red kitchen...

25:42.591 --> 25:45.026
One bass, one Dover.
How long? Two minutes.

25:45.094 --> 25:47.495
(Announcer) Will is hoping
Krupa can deliver on her fish.

25:47.562 --> 25:50.330
That Dover sole must be
overcooked by now.

25:50.398 --> 25:52.532
[Bleep]

25:52.600 --> 25:54.367
It's mush.

25:54.435 --> 25:55.669
Do another one.
All right.

25:55.736 --> 25:58.872
Krupa, ehhhh...Ugh!

25:58.940 --> 26:01.741
That's the sign of
overcooked fish.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.410
Uh, Jen, I need that
pushed back.

26:03.477 --> 26:05.344
How long?
Give me, like, six minutes.

26:05.412 --> 26:07.780
Ah, Krupa.
She's was [Bleep] up on fish.

26:07.848 --> 26:09.682
She had no idea
what she was doing.

26:09.749 --> 26:11.684
Watching her was like
going to the dentist.

26:11.751 --> 26:13.519
Krupa.
Yes.

26:13.586 --> 26:15.554
Slow everything down.
Everything's slowed down.

26:15.622 --> 26:17.423
(Announcer)
While Will tries to recover

26:17.490 --> 26:19.225
from Krupa's shaky start
on the fish station...

26:19.293 --> 26:21.459
Krupa, you're the one pushing.
[Bleep]

26:21.527 --> 26:23.228
(Announcer)
Back in the blue kitchen...

26:23.296 --> 26:24.629
Paul, there's nothing
going out.

26:24.697 --> 26:25.496
(Announcer)
Paul's brigade seems

26:25.564 --> 26:26.932
to have lost their momentum.

26:26.999 --> 26:28.499
Apps are out! Let's go.
Let's push it.

26:28.567 --> 26:30.568
Jonathan, give me the steaks.

26:30.636 --> 26:32.670
<i>Jonathan,</i> <i>do you need help?
</i> <i>No, I'm coming.</i>

26:32.738 --> 26:34.306
Are they ready or not?
Yes.

26:34.373 --> 26:36.473
Walk 'em with the sauce.

26:38.776 --> 26:41.879
This one's still [Bleep] raw.
Oh, [Bleep] me.

26:41.947 --> 26:44.648
Jonathan, come on man.
Get that [Bleep] together.

26:44.716 --> 26:46.516
You say that you cook meat,
let's see it.

26:46.584 --> 26:48.385
Don't [Bleep] talk to me
like that, man.

26:48.453 --> 26:49.220
<i>(Gordon)</i> <i>Turn around and
talk</i> <i>to your [Bleep] brigade.</i>

26:49.287 --> 26:50.921
Come on man, seriously.

26:50.989 --> 26:53.857
You're in control.
Talk to your brigade here.

26:53.924 --> 26:56.893
Give me the steaks.
Those are raw.

26:56.961 --> 26:58.627
If one's raw,
they're all raw.

26:58.695 --> 27:01.130
[Bleep] Come on, you guys
are killing me. Push!

27:07.185 --> 27:08.953
(Announcer) It's an hour
into dinner service,

27:09.021 --> 27:10.321
and Jonathan's undercooked
meat...

27:10.388 --> 27:12.556
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
This one's still raw.

27:12.625 --> 27:15.026
(Announcer) Has created a major
road block in the blue kitchen,

27:15.094 --> 27:16.427
which does not sit well
with Paul...

27:16.495 --> 27:18.128
Give me the steaks.

27:18.195 --> 27:20.563
(Announcer) Or Elise.
Those are raw.

27:20.632 --> 27:22.298
If one's raw, they're all raw.
[Bleep]

27:22.366 --> 27:24.200
Come on. You guys are
killing me. Push!

27:24.268 --> 27:26.637
Put them all in the oven.
<i>Get them all in.</i>

27:26.704 --> 27:29.205
What?
Don't throw things.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.174
[Bleep] Fight back.
Don't get mad.

27:31.242 --> 27:33.208
Jonathan was acting like
a little bitch.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.210
Put them all back in the [Bleep]
oven, get them cooking.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.746
I tried to help him,
and he wanted to act

27:36.813 --> 27:37.880
like a little cry baby, like,

27:37.948 --> 27:39.314
"oh, no, I got this.
I got this."

27:39.382 --> 27:40.716
Paul, there's nothing
going out.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.484
How long you need
on the steaks, Jonathan?

27:42.552 --> 27:43.953
Two minutes?
Gimme an honest number.

27:44.021 --> 27:45.655
Three minutes. Three minutes.
Thank you. [Bleep].

27:45.722 --> 27:47.723
<i>(Jonathan)</i> <i>There's a
lot</i> <i>of thick ones, man.</i>

27:47.791 --> 27:48.923
(Announcer) As Paul tries
to keep Jonathan focused

27:48.991 --> 27:50.058
on the meat station,

27:50.126 --> 27:51.726
over in the red kitchen,

27:51.794 --> 27:55.229
Will tries to get Krupa
to focus on her fish.

27:55.297 --> 27:58.700
Krupa, long on the Dover,
a bass, a filet, and a New York?

27:58.768 --> 28:01.903
A Dover, a bass... guys!
Pay attention!

28:01.971 --> 28:05.105
Dover, bass, filet, and New York...
I've got five minutes.

28:05.173 --> 28:10.110
Picking Krupa probably wasn't
the most intelligent decision.

28:10.178 --> 28:13.013
[Gasps] Oh my God.

28:13.081 --> 28:14.281
Behind you.

28:14.348 --> 28:18.152
Bass, you should have
the sauce, so...

28:18.219 --> 28:20.220
Another minute, give it another
minute in the oven, please.

28:20.288 --> 28:21.487
I'm not happy with that.

28:21.555 --> 28:22.955
We got of to a great start

28:23.023 --> 28:24.590
now we've got deflated.
Come on!

28:24.658 --> 28:26.993
Do not give up.
I want everyone to push,

28:27.061 --> 28:28.360
<i>until the last ticket is out.</i>

28:28.428 --> 28:30.063
Heard?
All: Heard.

28:30.130 --> 28:32.165
(Announcer) While Will
motivates his brigade,

28:32.232 --> 28:33.833
over on the blue kitchen,

28:33.901 --> 28:35.201
Paul is hoping that
Jonathan's steaks...

28:35.268 --> 28:36.968
Two strips.

28:37.036 --> 28:39.771
(Announcer) Are finally
the correct temperature.

28:39.839 --> 28:41.773
Elise, get on meat.

28:41.841 --> 28:44.676
Jonathan this is...
Again, it's raw, dude.

28:44.744 --> 28:47.779
I gotta pull you.
Go help her with garnish.

28:47.847 --> 28:49.581
I kicked Jonathan off
the station because

28:49.648 --> 28:50.849
it got to the point
where I had to.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.783
Go help garnish,
and I'll take over meat.

28:52.851 --> 28:55.019
I need one strip right now, six all deck.
<i>Got you.</i>

28:55.087 --> 28:58.589
Jonathan sucks.
He can't cook, man.

28:58.656 --> 29:02.092
<i>(Elise)</i> <i>Three strips right now.
</i> <i>I've only got two.</i>

29:02.159 --> 29:04.260
Go over there.
He said off the meat station.

29:04.328 --> 29:06.062
Man, don't flip. Please don't
[Bleep] talk to me like that.

29:06.130 --> 29:07.263
He said go over there!

29:07.331 --> 29:08.932
What really pisses me off

29:08.999 --> 29:11.134
is the [Bleep]
coming from Elise.

29:11.202 --> 29:13.103
Get the bitches
out of the kitchen

29:13.170 --> 29:14.570
and let me get back
on my game.

29:14.638 --> 29:16.405
Just don't fight now, just...

29:16.473 --> 29:18.741
I'm not fighting.
I'd rather work it by myself.

29:18.808 --> 29:21.610
(Announcer) While Elise begins her
rescue of the meat station...

29:21.677 --> 29:23.478
Thank you.
You're welcome.

29:23.546 --> 29:25.413
(Announcer)
Back on the red side,

29:25.481 --> 29:27.616
Krupa is looking to bounce back
on the fish station.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.418
Behind. Fish. Dover.
Thank you.

29:30.486 --> 29:32.587
Bass, Dover, whatever.

29:32.655 --> 29:34.321
With the first two fish,
I [Bleep] up on them...

29:34.389 --> 29:35.589
Number 31.

29:35.657 --> 29:37.825
But I'm not too worried
about it.

29:37.893 --> 29:39.360
That I can definitely, you know,
come back from this.

29:39.427 --> 29:42.596
It's undercooked?

29:42.664 --> 29:43.931
Let me... let me take that back
to the chef.

29:43.999 --> 29:44.832
Okay. Thank you.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.035
(Gordon)
Oh, no, what's wrong?

29:48.103 --> 29:49.535
It's... it's raw.

29:49.603 --> 29:51.238
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Undercooked. Will...</i>

29:51.305 --> 29:53.740
Come on, [Bleep] Me.
[Bleep].

29:53.808 --> 29:55.942
No problem. Krupa. Yes, chef.

29:56.010 --> 29:58.311
Reflash this, all right?
Get that in the oven right now,

29:58.379 --> 29:59.846
reflash it and hurry
the [Bleep] up, please.

29:59.914 --> 30:03.083
[Whistles, imitates explosion]

30:03.151 --> 30:05.117
Are you kidding me?

30:05.185 --> 30:07.686
(Announcer) With Will now
struggling to get entrees out,

30:07.754 --> 30:09.454
over in the blue kitchen...

30:09.522 --> 30:11.824
Let's go! Two strips,
two branzini.

30:11.892 --> 30:14.260
(Announcer) Elise is now in complete
control of the meat station,

30:14.327 --> 30:17.062
and Paul looks to Carrie for...
Garnish in 30?

30:17.130 --> 30:18.998
Hold on guys.

30:19.065 --> 30:21.166
Do you need help?
45.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.501
Elise, get on garnish.

30:23.568 --> 30:25.870
Honestly, my mvp tonight
is Elise.

30:25.938 --> 30:27.172
All right,
what are we doing now?

30:27.239 --> 30:28.372
Two strip, two branzini?

30:28.440 --> 30:30.574
She had my back tonight 100%.

30:30.642 --> 30:32.076
I don't care
what other people say.

30:32.144 --> 30:34.679
Salt and pepper?
Yeah, babe.

30:34.746 --> 30:37.014
I haven't got it quite...
Come on, girl.

30:37.081 --> 30:38.949
Give me the garnish guys.
Come on. Not yet.

30:39.017 --> 30:40.617
She needs 30 seconds.
Hey, honey. I got it.

30:40.685 --> 30:42.385
You're really in my way right
now, okay? I got this.

30:42.453 --> 30:43.586
Seriously. I got it.

30:43.654 --> 30:45.455
No, you don't got it, Carrie.

30:45.523 --> 30:47.657
You need help, and Elise
to the rescue, as always.

30:47.725 --> 30:49.326
Captain save-a-hoe.

30:49.393 --> 30:50.961
He told me to
come over here.

30:51.029 --> 30:52.529
I'm just doing what
he told me what to do.

30:52.596 --> 30:53.362
I need the peas
and the tendrils.

30:53.430 --> 30:55.298
They're coming right now.

30:55.365 --> 30:57.499
I got it.

30:57.567 --> 30:59.568
God, I got this. Go.

30:59.636 --> 31:00.903
It's still cold. Okay.

31:00.971 --> 31:02.338
No, they're not.
They're hot.

31:02.405 --> 31:04.006
All right, fine.

31:04.074 --> 31:05.074
Peas and pea tendrils.
Thank you.

31:05.142 --> 31:06.876
Thank you. Go.

31:06.944 --> 31:08.844
(Announcer)
As Paul's strategic decision

31:08.911 --> 31:11.179
to move Elise from station
to station pays off...

31:11.247 --> 31:12.347
Oh.

31:12.414 --> 31:14.216
<i>Is it good?</i>
Very good.

31:14.283 --> 31:15.783
Over in the red kitchen,

31:15.852 --> 31:17.752
in order to
turn his kitchen around,

31:17.820 --> 31:20.488
Will must make an executive
decision of his own.

31:20.556 --> 31:22.724
Natalie.
Yes.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.192
Get on fish.
Krupa, get on deserts.

31:24.260 --> 31:25.559
Okay.
<i>All right?</i>

31:25.626 --> 31:27.161
I finally had to replace her
at the station

31:27.229 --> 31:29.196
because there was
nothing going.

31:29.264 --> 31:31.365
We need to start rolling here.
We're starting to slow down.

31:31.432 --> 31:32.900
This is not good.
We gotta pick it up.

31:32.968 --> 31:34.601
<i>Everybody keep pushing,</i>
<i>keep fighting.</i>

31:34.669 --> 31:37.271
Natalie, can you take
that bass up for me?

31:37.339 --> 31:38.739
This one?
Yeah.

31:38.806 --> 31:40.307
What is it supposed
to be?

31:40.375 --> 31:41.574
Cooked.

31:41.641 --> 31:44.110
Uh, that is raw.

31:44.178 --> 31:46.212
<i>(Will)</i> <i>Natalie, I need a bass
,</i> <i>and I need it right now.</i>

31:46.280 --> 31:49.315
It needs, seriously,
eight minutes.

31:49.383 --> 31:51.017
Eight minutes?

31:59.534 --> 32:01.135
(Announcer) It's two hours
into the final dinner service

32:01.203 --> 32:02.736
in Hell's Kitchen.

32:02.805 --> 32:04.371
We're starting to slow down.

32:04.439 --> 32:05.673
This is not good.
We gotta pick up.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.074
(Announcer)
Krupa's poor performance

32:07.142 --> 32:08.709
on the fish station...
What is it supposed to be?

32:08.777 --> 32:11.812
Cooked.
Uh, that is raw.

32:11.879 --> 32:15.215
(Announcer) Has forced Will
to replace her with Natalie.

32:15.283 --> 32:17.083
Natalie, I need a bass,
and I need it right now.

32:17.151 --> 32:19.519
It needs, seriously,
eight minutes.

32:19.586 --> 32:21.723
Eight minutes?

32:22.990 --> 32:25.058
I didn't have anything.
Nothing was done.

32:25.126 --> 32:27.159
I have to do these
from start to finish.

32:27.227 --> 32:29.829
Krupa definitely left me
in, like, this [Bleep] hole.

32:29.896 --> 32:32.164
Like, no fish seasoned, nothing.

32:32.232 --> 32:34.033
You really eight out?
Yes, really.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.935
[Bleep] <i>(Will)</i>
<i>How long, Natalie?</i>

32:36.002 --> 32:38.370
Seven minutes.

32:38.438 --> 32:40.672
There were one too many bumps
for my [Bleep] liking.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.841
One too many bumps.

32:42.908 --> 32:45.143
I'm being honest with you,
that's what I need.

32:45.211 --> 32:47.178
I'll have the next ticket
with the bass.

32:47.246 --> 32:49.113
Seven [Bleep] minutes.
There was nothing done, Will.

32:49.181 --> 32:51.615
<i>It's now or never for Will</i>
<i>right now... let's do this.</i>

32:51.683 --> 32:54.018
(Announcer) As Will tries to
get his team back on track,

32:54.086 --> 32:55.820
over in the blue kitchen...

32:55.888 --> 32:58.388
Just push hard. One strip,
one branzini, how long?

32:58.456 --> 33:00.790
I got one and a half.
Beautiful.

33:00.859 --> 33:04.594
(Announcer) Paul is driving his
team to deliver the final entrees.

33:04.662 --> 33:06.696
This is it.
This is the biggest push.

33:06.764 --> 33:08.966
Be as a team. We are [Bleep] blue!
We got this.

33:09.033 --> 33:11.134
[Indistinct]
Let's go! Push! Push!

33:11.202 --> 33:14.036
Yes, chef. Let's go!
We can do this, baby. 30 seconds!

33:14.104 --> 33:16.305
Push as hard as you guys can
[Bleep] do.

33:16.373 --> 33:18.407
I picked you all for a reason.

33:18.475 --> 33:20.509
Prove it to yourself that
you can give on a high note.

33:20.577 --> 33:22.211
Push to prove to chef Ramsay

33:22.279 --> 33:23.279
why he shouldn't have
kicked you outta here.

33:23.347 --> 33:24.914
Service.

33:24.982 --> 33:26.715
(Announcer)
Passionate Paul has his team

33:26.783 --> 33:28.050
motivated and moving.

33:28.118 --> 33:30.151
The branzini?
Thank you.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.954
(Announcer) While back in the red kitchen...
Behind fish.

33:33.022 --> 33:35.257
(Announcer) Will's key move of
placing Natalie on the fish station

33:35.324 --> 33:38.226
is paying off as hungry diners
receive their entrees.

33:38.294 --> 33:40.461
<i>How's the steak?</i>
Really good.

33:40.529 --> 33:42.163
(Announcer) And it appears
that both kitchens are

33:42.231 --> 33:43.731
totally hitting their stride.

33:43.799 --> 33:46.200
Tommy, I need three New York's.
I need them right now.

33:46.268 --> 33:48.535
Coming right now.
<i>Come on guys, let's move.</i>

33:48.603 --> 33:50.737
<i>(Woman) Thank you.</i>
Come on, we're almost there.

33:50.805 --> 33:52.973

Thank you, chef.

It's a pan-roasted sea bass, chef.

<i>It's got finesse.</i>

36:58.882 --> 36:59.982

incredibly difficult.

<i>Will.</i>
Yes, chef.

37:26.808 --> 37:29.443
You have been <i>Hell's Kitchen's</i>

37:29.511 --> 37:31.645

across the board,

So I'd like both of you to
step up to your doors, please.

can barely compose my words.

38:05.845 --> 38:08.213

Absolutely life-altering.
