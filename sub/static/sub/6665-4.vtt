00:00.499 --> 00:03.498
<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>
<i>and I graduated</i>

00:03.499 --> 00:05.498
<i>from one of Canada's</i>
<i>top business schools</i>

00:05.499 --> 00:07.498
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.499 --> 00:09.498
<i>Now I'm using</i>
<i>my knowledge</i>

00:09.499 --> 00:11.498
<i>to help struggling</i>
<i>small business owners make it</i>

00:11.499 --> 00:14.498
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:14.499 --> 00:17.499
This is "Nathan for You."

00:19.499 --> 00:21.498
<i>Niky's Sports is</i>
<i>a growing retail soccer chain</i>

00:21.499 --> 00:23.498
<i>in Los Angeles,</i>
<i>California,</i>

00:23.499 --> 00:25.498
<i>and although owner</i>
<i>Niky Orellana</i>

00:25.499 --> 00:27.498
<i>has high hopes</i>
<i>of becoming a household name,</i>

00:27.499 --> 00:30.498
<i>the high cost of advertising</i>
<i>has been holding him back.</i>

00:30.499 --> 00:36.498
- I used to pay, like,
$7,000 for a full-page ad.

00:36.499 --> 00:38.498
<i>- But fortunately for Niky,</i>
<i>I had an innovative idea</i>

00:38.499 --> 00:42.498
<i>to gain exposure for his brand</i>
<i>without breaking the bank.</i>

00:42.499 --> 00:43.498
Hi, Niky?
- Yes, sir.

00:43.499 --> 00:45.498
- Hey, Nathan.

00:45.499 --> 00:46.498
- How you doing?
- Hey, good. How are you?

00:46.499 --> 00:47.498
- All right.

00:47.499 --> 00:48.498
- Thanks for having me.

00:48.499 --> 00:51.499
- No problem.

00:59.499 --> 01:01.498
- Um, how's business going?

01:01.499 --> 01:02.498
- All right.

01:02.499 --> 01:05.498
<i>- The best way to advertise</i>
<i>a sporting goods store</i>

01:05.498 --> 01:07.498
<i>is to get the endorsement</i>
<i>of a professional athlete.</i>

01:07.499 --> 01:12.498
<i>The problem is, landing a deal</i>
<i>like that can cost millions.</i>

01:12.499 --> 01:15.498
<i>But if Niky's were to sign</i>
<i>cheap, long-term contracts</i>

01:15.499 --> 01:17.498
<i>with a number of children</i>
<i>that showed potential,</i>

01:17.499 --> 01:19.498
<i>all it would take is</i>
<i>for one kid to turn pro</i>

01:19.499 --> 01:22.498
<i>for the investment</i>
<i>to pay off big-time.</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.498
<i>The plan:</i>
<i>secure endorsements</i>

01:24.499 --> 01:25.498
<i>with the soccer stars</i>
<i>of tomorrow</i>

01:25.499 --> 01:28.499
<i>by investing in kids</i>
<i>while they're still cheap.</i>

01:32.499 --> 01:34.498
- Well, if it's a possibility,
why not?

01:34.499 --> 01:36.498
- The only thing is,
if you do this,

01:36.499 --> 01:41.498
it won't pay off for another
10 to 15 years' time.

01:41.499 --> 01:43.498
- Mm-hmm.
- So I guess I should ask,

01:43.499 --> 01:46.498
you know, do you think
you'll be around then?

01:46.499 --> 01:47.498
Is your health okay
and everything?

01:47.499 --> 01:50.498
- I'm okay
at the moment.

01:50.499 --> 01:52.498
- You know, I just wouldn't want
to do all this work if it's--

01:52.499 --> 01:54.499
you know, you're gonna be
dead or something.

01:57.499 --> 01:59.498
- Well, you never know.

01:59.499 --> 02:02.498
- Okay.
It's probably worth doing then.

02:02.499 --> 02:05.499
- Yeah.
- Roll the dice on that.

02:08.499 --> 02:10.499
- [whispering]
I guess.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.498
<i>- Niky was in,</i>
<i>so over the next couple weeks,</i>

02:14.499 --> 02:15.498
<i>I went to watch several</i>

02:15.499 --> 02:18.498
<i>of the best-ranked youth teams</i>
<i>in the area,</i>

02:18.499 --> 02:20.498
<i>taking note</i>
<i>of their top players.</i>

02:20.499 --> 02:22.498
Some of these kids
suck, huh?

02:22.499 --> 02:24.499
- What's that?
- Some of these kids suck.

02:25.499 --> 02:27.498
- Oh, yeah.

02:27.499 --> 02:28.498
<i>And after each game, I would</i>
<i>wait in the parking lot</i>

02:28.499 --> 02:30.498
<i>to talk to their parents.</i>

02:30.499 --> 02:32.498
Your kid was really good.

02:32.499 --> 02:33.498
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, you were really good.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.498
What's your name?
- Josh.

02:35.499 --> 02:37.498
- Josh, hey, nice to meet you.
Nathan.

02:37.499 --> 02:39.498
<i>I told them I was scouting</i>
<i>young athletes</i>

02:39.499 --> 02:42.498
<i>for an endorsement deal,</i>
<i>and his mom seemed interested,</i>

02:42.499 --> 02:45.498
<i>so I asked permission to take</i>
<i>all his physical measurements</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.498
<i>which I would then use</i>
<i>to make my final decision.</i>

02:47.499 --> 02:49.498
[photo snap]
Great.

02:49.499 --> 02:50.498
<i>Over the course</i>
<i>of several days,</i>

02:50.499 --> 02:51.498
<i>I gathered information</i>

02:51.499 --> 02:54.498
<i>on as many of the top kids</i>
<i>as I could,</i>

02:54.499 --> 02:55.498
<i>and even though some parents</i>
<i>had doubts</i>

02:55.499 --> 02:57.499
<i>about their kids'</i>
<i>potential...</i>

03:00.499 --> 03:01.499
- Because he's--okay.
- Yeah.

03:03.499 --> 03:05.498
<i>- I was still able</i>
<i>to get extensive data</i>

03:05.499 --> 03:07.498
<i>on 40 promising</i>
<i>young athletes</i>

03:07.499 --> 03:09.498
<i>from in and around</i>
<i>the City of Angels.</i>

03:09.499 --> 03:12.498
<i>But before making offers,</i>
<i>I wanted to figure out</i>

03:12.499 --> 03:15.498
<i>which of these kids were</i>
<i>most likely to develop</i>

03:15.499 --> 03:18.498
<i>the athletic physique needed</i>
<i>to play soccer professionally,</i>

03:18.499 --> 03:20.498
<i>so I met</i>
<i>with Cornelius Ladd,</i>

03:20.499 --> 03:23.498
<i>an age progression specialist</i>
<i>I found on Craigslist,</i>

03:23.499 --> 03:24.498
<i>who said he could</i>
<i>accurately predict</i>

03:24.499 --> 03:28.498
<i>what these kids would look like</i>
<i>when they were all grown up.</i>

03:28.499 --> 03:30.498
I don't know much
about age progression.

03:30.499 --> 03:32.498
Is this kind of
a science then?

03:32.499 --> 03:34.498
- Yes, police use
this technology all the time...

03:34.499 --> 03:36.498
- Okay.
- For missing children's cases,

03:36.499 --> 03:40.498
and children have actually
been found by the police

03:40.499 --> 03:42.498
based on renderings
of artists like myself.

03:42.499 --> 03:44.498
- Wow.
- I mean,

03:44.499 --> 03:48.498
I have a really good eye
for what could possibly be,

03:48.499 --> 03:50.498
as far as what a person
could look like.

03:50.499 --> 03:52.498
<i>- Cornelius seemed perfect</i>
<i>for the job,</i>

03:52.499 --> 03:54.498
<i>so I gave him</i>
<i>a jump drive</i>

03:54.499 --> 03:56.498
<i>containing all the photos</i>
<i>of my top picks,</i>

03:56.499 --> 03:59.498
<i>and later that week,</i>
<i>I returned to see the results.</i>

03:59.499 --> 04:04.498
All right, so...
this is him?

04:04.499 --> 04:06.498
- Yes.

04:06.499 --> 04:09.498
- Um, what age
is this at?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.498
- This child,
I believe, is 8,

04:11.499 --> 04:14.498
and I age-progressed him
to around 22,

04:14.499 --> 04:17.498
and there's quite a bit
of progression in this picture

04:17.499 --> 04:20.498
where you take this young child
who has no facial hair,

04:20.499 --> 04:22.498
and I added facial hair.

04:22.499 --> 04:24.498
His face is
spread out more.

04:24.499 --> 04:27.498
His hair is completely gone
because of a choice,

04:27.499 --> 04:29.498
and you know, a lot of people
wear bald today.

04:29.499 --> 04:31.498
It's a "in" thing.

04:31.499 --> 04:33.498
- How sure are you

04:33.499 --> 04:36.498
this is what his body
is gonna look like?

04:36.499 --> 04:39.498
- I would say
his body's about 90%.

04:39.499 --> 04:40.498
At a constant progression,

04:40.499 --> 04:42.498
his body would
look like that, 90%.

04:42.499 --> 04:43.498
- 90% chance?

04:43.499 --> 04:44.498
- Yeah.

04:44.499 --> 04:45.498
- Okay.

04:45.499 --> 04:47.498
- Okay.
You want to go to the next one?

04:47.499 --> 04:48.498
- Next one?
- Yeah.

04:48.499 --> 04:49.498
- Okay, sure.

04:49.499 --> 04:51.498
- So in this picture,

04:51.499 --> 04:55.498
I think he would grow to be
a very attractive young man,

04:55.499 --> 04:57.498
and I tried to show that
in the picture

04:57.499 --> 05:00.498
and also to keep his ethnicity
the same, you know.

05:00.499 --> 05:02.498
- You're pretty sure
this is how he'll look?

05:02.499 --> 05:03.498
- Yes, definitely.

05:03.499 --> 05:05.498
Again, you can use this
in a court of law.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.498
- You're sure? 'Cause there's
a lot of money riding on this.

05:07.499 --> 05:09.498
- I'm 90% sure.

05:09.499 --> 05:13.498
- Okay.
Um, what--

05:13.499 --> 05:14.498
- Let's go to the next one.
- Next one?

05:14.499 --> 05:17.498
- Next one.
- Okay.

05:17.499 --> 05:19.498
Why is she playing
with her hair like that?

05:19.499 --> 05:21.498
- 'Cause it's cute.
[laughs]

05:21.499 --> 05:23.498
- Okay.

05:23.499 --> 05:25.498
>> In her, I'm projecting
my own little imagination,

05:25.499 --> 05:27.498
but I project that
she's having fun.

05:27.499 --> 05:28.498
- So it's science,
but then you add

05:28.499 --> 05:32.498
your own kind of opinions,
or--

05:32.499 --> 05:33.498
- Right, you have to have
a vision

05:33.499 --> 05:35.498
when you start
the project.

05:35.499 --> 05:39.498
Ultimately, what you end up
with is science and vision.

05:39.499 --> 05:41.498
- So this is a combination
of both?

05:41.499 --> 05:45.499
- Right, it's a combination
of science and vision.

05:46.499 --> 05:50.498
- Okay.
Um...

05:50.499 --> 05:54.498
This is a boy.

05:54.499 --> 05:57.499
- No.
- This, yeah.

05:59.499 --> 06:04.498
- Okay, so...
I made this a girl.

06:04.499 --> 06:06.498
Okay?
I thought this was a girl.

06:06.499 --> 06:09.498
- Okay.
I-I-It's a boy.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.498
- Okay.
- I believe, yeah.

06:10.499 --> 06:11.498
- Well, the good news
about that is--

06:11.499 --> 06:14.498
or the funny news is that
I could take a girl or boy

06:14.499 --> 06:16.498
and make it into a girl.

06:16.499 --> 06:17.498
- I'm just more concerned
with accuracy.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.498
- Yeah, I'll make him a man
on the next version.

06:19.499 --> 06:21.499
- Okay.
Um--

06:23.040 --> 06:25.339
<i>- I wasn't sure about some</i>
<i>of Cornelius' choices,</i>

06:25.340 --> 06:28.339
<i>but still, I felt like</i>
<i>I had enough information</i>

06:28.340 --> 06:30.339
<i>to start making offers,</i>
<i>so later that week,</i>

06:30.340 --> 06:32.339
<i>I began meeting</i>
<i>with the parents</i>

06:32.340 --> 06:35.339
<i>of my top picks to negotiate</i>
<i>an endorsement deal</i>

06:35.340 --> 06:38.339
<i>that would go into effect</i>
<i>if their kids went pro.</i>

06:38.340 --> 06:40.339
We think $250 is
very fair

06:40.340 --> 06:42.339
because of the age
of your child,

06:42.340 --> 06:44.339
and we expect, you know,
a low price

06:44.340 --> 06:49.339
because we are buying
while he still, you know, sucks.

06:49.340 --> 06:51.339
- Hmm.
- Okay.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.339
- I mean, no one else is
offering you deals, right?

06:53.340 --> 06:56.339
- Right.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.339
[clears throat]
All right.

06:58.340 --> 07:01.339
<i>- The majority of parents</i>
<i>agreed to sign our contract,</i>

07:01.340 --> 07:03.339
<i>which would allow Niky's</i>
<i>to use their kids</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:07.339
<i>as future brand ambassadors</i>
<i>if they became star athletes,</i>

07:07.340 --> 07:09.339
<i>but I was most excited</i>
<i>about landing a deal</i>

07:09.340 --> 07:11.339
<i>with my top prospect,</i>
<i>Sasha.</i>

07:11.340 --> 07:12.339
<i>His skills on the field</i>

07:12.340 --> 07:15.339
<i>far exceeded</i>
<i>any of the other players,</i>

07:15.340 --> 07:17.339
<i>and I felt like</i>
<i>he was our best shot</i>

07:17.340 --> 07:19.339
<i>at playing in the big leagues</i>
<i>and becoming a star,</i>

07:19.340 --> 07:21.339
<i>so once I finished up</i>
<i>with his dad,</i>

07:21.340 --> 07:23.339
<i>I sat down with him</i>
<i>to make sure</i>

07:23.340 --> 07:24.339
<i>he stayed on track.</i>

07:24.340 --> 07:26.339
We're really excited
to be in business with you.

07:26.340 --> 07:29.339
I see a lot of potential.

07:29.340 --> 07:31.339
- What does potential mean?

07:31.340 --> 07:33.339
<i>- But as we were chatting</i>
<i>about his future,</i>

07:33.340 --> 07:35.339
<i>Sasha said something</i>
<i>that blindsided me.</i>

07:35.340 --> 07:40.340
- When I grow up,
I want to become an astronaut.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.339
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.339
- I mean, Sasha, you know,
you can do what you want,

07:45.340 --> 07:47.339
but, you know, your talent
really is on the field.

07:47.340 --> 07:49.339
- But I think
when I'm older enough like you,

07:49.340 --> 07:52.339
maybe I could
go to the moon.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.339
<i>- I was deeply concerned.</i>

07:53.340 --> 07:55.339
<i>If Sasha chose</i>
<i>to pursue his dream</i>

07:55.340 --> 07:57.339
<i>of working</i>
<i>in the space program,</i>

07:57.340 --> 07:58.339
<i>it would be a huge setback</i>

07:58.340 --> 08:01.339
<i>for Niky's endorsement</i>
<i>portfolio.</i>

08:01.340 --> 08:03.339
<i>I had to find a way</i>
<i>to keep him on track,</i>

08:03.340 --> 08:05.339
<i>so later that week,</i>
<i>I arranged</i>

08:05.340 --> 08:07.339
<i>for who I said</i>
<i>was a real astronaut</i>

08:07.340 --> 08:09.339
<i>to pay a visit</i>
<i>to Sasha's home,</i>

08:09.340 --> 08:13.339
<i>but in reality, this astronaut</i>
<i>was my old pal James Bailey,</i>

08:13.340 --> 08:15.339
<i>who I knew</i>
<i>had a special skill</i>

08:15.340 --> 08:18.339
<i>for nudging children</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

08:18.340 --> 08:20.339
I have a special surprise
for you today.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.339
- Okay.

08:22.340 --> 08:25.339
- How would you like to meet
a real-life astronaut?

08:25.340 --> 08:26.339
- A real one?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.339
- Yeah.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.339
<i>So I brought in James</i>
<i>to help Sasha</i>

08:29.340 --> 08:32.339
<i>learn a bit more</i>
<i>about life in space.</i>

08:32.340 --> 08:34.339
- My whole life has
just been a nightmare.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.339
It's a terrible
experience.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.339
You know, most of my friends
have died in space

08:38.340 --> 08:41.339
or gone insane from
the unimaginable loneliness

08:41.340 --> 08:42.339
of being there.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.339
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:44.340 --> 08:48.339
My wife and my kids,
they died in space.

08:48.340 --> 08:49.339
It was an accident.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.339
- But I thought kids
can't go to space.

08:51.340 --> 08:55.339
- Yeah, I smuggled 'em on
against the rules.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.339
- Oh.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.339
<i>- As James went on,</i>
<i>I could tell</i>

08:58.340 --> 09:00.339
<i>Sasha was getting</i>
<i>a better understanding</i>

09:00.340 --> 09:02.339
<i>of the dangers</i>
<i>of space travel.</i>

09:02.340 --> 09:04.339
- Some restaurants,
they won't even serve me

09:04.340 --> 09:06.339
because I used to be
an astronaut.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.339
- Really?
That's like a brown person.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.339
If you were a brown person
a long time ago,

09:10.340 --> 09:12.339
what happened, like, you
couldn't go to a restaurant.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.339
Is that how it feels?

09:14.340 --> 09:17.339
- Yeah, that's kind of
how it is.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.339
It's that kind of discrimination
that happens.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.339
- Really?
- Yeah, you know,

09:21.340 --> 09:24.339
I really just wish I had
decided to be a soccer player

09:24.340 --> 09:27.339
instead of an astronaut.

09:27.340 --> 09:28.339
- Oh?

09:28.340 --> 09:29.339
- Yeah, it's too late
for me now.

09:29.340 --> 09:33.339
I'll probably die
on my next mission anyways.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.339
- Really?
When is it, in two years?

09:35.340 --> 09:38.339
- Yes, sure,
two years from now.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.339
<i>- After James was done</i>
<i>talking to Sasha,</i>

09:40.340 --> 09:42.339
<i>I came back in</i>
<i>to see how it went.</i>

09:42.340 --> 09:44.339
Wow, that was cool, huh?

09:44.340 --> 09:45.339
- Yeah, it was amazing.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.339
- You got to talk
to a real astronaut.

09:47.340 --> 09:49.339
- Yeah.
- So what did you learn?

09:49.340 --> 09:52.339
- He said that his family
died in space

09:52.340 --> 09:55.339
because he didn't follow
the rules, and he took his kid.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.339
- Mm.

09:56.340 --> 09:59.339
- And he told me that once,

09:59.340 --> 10:04.339
a alien tried to--
to pull him into the sun.

10:04.340 --> 10:06.339
- Oh, okay.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.339
So do you still want
to be an astronaut?

10:07.340 --> 10:11.339
- Well, a little,
not really, not as much.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.339
- What do you think
you're gonna do instead?

10:13.340 --> 10:15.339
- Play soccer.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.339
- Well, if that's your choice,
then that's your choice.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.339
- Yeah.

10:20.340 --> 10:23.339
<i>- I did it,</i>
<i>and with Sasha back on track,</i>

10:23.340 --> 10:24.339
<i>I could finally return</i>
<i>to Niky's</i>

10:24.340 --> 10:27.339
<i>with the solid portfolio</i>
<i>of kids I needed</i>

10:27.340 --> 10:30.339
<i>to give him the best shot</i>
<i>at becoming a national brand.</i>

10:30.340 --> 10:33.339
I mean, some of them are
definitely gonna flame out,

10:33.340 --> 10:34.339
but all you really need is one
to go pro

10:34.340 --> 10:36.339
for this to pay off
big-time,

10:36.340 --> 10:39.339
so I think your odds
are pretty good.

10:39.340 --> 10:40.339
- Oh.
- Yes.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.339
- Good.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.339
- One thing I like to do

10:43.340 --> 10:46.339
is follow up with the businesses
I work with, you know,

10:46.340 --> 10:48.339
once the idea's done,
to find out

10:48.340 --> 10:51.340
if it was actually
successful.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.339
- Mm-hmm.

10:56.340 --> 10:58.339
- What did you just do?

10:58.340 --> 10:59.339
- Nothing.
- Oh, okay.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.339
Just looking at your phone?

11:01.340 --> 11:02.339
Okay, that's okay.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.339
Okay.

11:04.340 --> 11:07.339
Thanks so much
and take care.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.339
Good luck.

<i>[upbeat music]</i>

11:12.340 --> 11:20.340
<i>♪</i>

11:25.347 --> 11:27.846
<i>- Emily Yep has been</i>
<i>operating her antique shop,</i>

11:27.847 --> 11:29.846
<i>Magnolia and Willow,</i>
<i>in the Long Beach area,</i>

11:29.847 --> 11:32.846
<i>for over five years,</i>
<i>but lately,</i>

11:32.847 --> 11:34.846
<i>she's been finding it tough</i>
<i>to get customers in the door.</i>

11:34.847 --> 11:36.846
- It does get hard
when it's really slow.

11:36.847 --> 11:39.846
I mean, it always feels like
it's the end of the world.

11:39.847 --> 11:41.846
<i>- But after surveying</i>
<i>the neighborhood,</i>

11:41.847 --> 11:43.846
<i>I realized that Emily</i>
<i>might not be taking</i>

11:43.847 --> 11:45.846
<i>full advantage</i>
<i>of her surroundings,</i>

11:45.847 --> 11:48.846
<i>so I paid her a visit</i>
<i>with a way to help.</i>

11:48.847 --> 11:49.846
I noticed there are
a lot of bars

11:49.847 --> 11:50.846
and nightclubs
in the area.

11:50.847 --> 11:52.846
- Yeah.

11:52.847 --> 11:53.846
- Is that something
you like?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.846
- Um, it's a little hard.

11:55.847 --> 11:57.846
Sometimes we have some problems
with over-serving

11:57.847 --> 11:59.846
and that kind of thing,
but most of the time,

11:59.847 --> 12:02.846
we're closed by 6:00,
so it doesn't affect us as much.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.846
<i>- But maybe it should.</i>

12:04.847 --> 12:07.846
<i>You see, Magnolia and Willow</i>
<i>has a strict</i>

12:07.847 --> 12:08.846
<i>"you break it, you buy it"</i>
<i>policy,</i>

12:08.847 --> 12:11.846
<i>meaning that if an item breaks,</i>
<i>it's as good as a sale,</i>

12:11.847 --> 12:13.846
<i>so if, instead of closing</i>
<i>at 6:00 p.m.,</i>

12:13.847 --> 12:14.846
<i>Emily extended</i>
<i>her hours</i>

12:14.847 --> 12:17.846
<i>to be open</i>
<i>straight through the night,</i>

12:17.847 --> 12:19.846
<i>her chances</i>
<i>of inebriated customers</i>

12:19.847 --> 12:22.846
<i>generating new sales</i>
<i>would greatly increase.</i>

12:22.847 --> 12:24.846
<i>The plan:</i>
<i>attract late-night drunks</i>

12:24.847 --> 12:27.847
<i>by staying open</i>
<i>24 hours a day.</i>

12:28.847 --> 12:30.846
- Well, possibly,
I guess, yeah.

12:30.847 --> 12:34.846
I mean, I would--
I guess so, yeah.

12:34.847 --> 12:36.846
- I mean,
the way I see it,

12:36.847 --> 12:38.846
if you get the right drunk
in here...

12:38.847 --> 12:39.846
- Yeah.
- You could make

12:39.847 --> 12:41.846
more in a single night
than you do all month.

12:41.847 --> 12:43.846
- I just wouldn't prefer
a broken item.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.846
I'd rather sell a good one,
but yeah, I mean,

12:46.847 --> 12:48.846
it would be the same thing,
no matter what happens, so.

12:48.847 --> 12:50.846
- I mean, a lot of this stuff
is--probably the only way

12:50.847 --> 12:53.847
you're gonna get anything for it
is if someone breaks it.

12:54.847 --> 12:56.846
- Well, some of the items,
but yeah.

12:56.847 --> 12:58.846
- Yeah, yeah.

12:58.847 --> 12:59.846
- Yeah.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.846
<i>- Emily agreed to try out</i>
<i>my idea</i>

13:01.847 --> 13:04.846
<i>to see if it got the results</i>
<i>I had promised,</i>

13:04.847 --> 13:06.846
<i>so the next day,</i>
<i>I returned to the store</i>

13:06.847 --> 13:08.846
<i>and officially changed</i>
<i>the hours.</i>

13:08.847 --> 13:11.846
<i>Then to help our cause, I had</i>
<i>the aisles narrowed slightly</i>

13:11.847 --> 13:13.846
<i>and moved some</i>
<i>of her poorer-selling items</i>

13:13.847 --> 13:15.846
<i>to an area of the store</i>
<i>that would increase</i>

13:15.847 --> 13:18.846
<i>the likelihood</i>
<i>of accidental contact.</i>

13:18.847 --> 13:21.846
<i>So that evening,</i>
<i>once the sun went down,</i>

13:21.847 --> 13:24.846
<i>it was time to see if the new</i>
<i>extended hours would work.</i>

13:24.847 --> 13:26.846
<i>But knowing</i>
<i>that tonight's sales</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:28.846
<i>would determine</i>
<i>if Emily kept using my idea,</i>

13:28.847 --> 13:31.846
<i>I wanted to guarantee</i>
<i>we had some results,</i>

13:31.847 --> 13:33.846
<i>so I headed</i>
<i>to a nearby bar</i>

13:33.847 --> 13:35.846
<i>with a plan</i>
<i>to befriend a drunk patron</i>

13:35.847 --> 13:37.846
<i>and lead them</i>
<i>back to the store.</i>

13:37.847 --> 13:38.846
Do you know the antique shop
next door?

13:38.847 --> 13:40.846
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:40.847 --> 13:41.847
- They're open
24 hours now.

13:42.847 --> 13:44.846
- Yeah.
- Okay, well...

13:44.847 --> 13:46.846
<i>- After a few</i>
<i>unsuccessful attempts</i>

13:46.847 --> 13:47.847
<i>to connect</i>
<i>with the locals...</i>

13:49.847 --> 13:51.846
<i>- I finally found someone</i>
<i>who was willing to chat.</i>

13:51.847 --> 13:52.846
- What's your favorite movie?

13:52.847 --> 13:53.846
- "Inception."

13:53.847 --> 13:55.846
- "Inception," really?

13:55.847 --> 13:56.846
- Yeah.
Have you seen that?

13:56.847 --> 13:58.846
- Why?
Why is it your favorite movie?

13:58.847 --> 14:01.847
- What's yours?

14:02.847 --> 14:04.846
- "Forrest Gump."

14:04.847 --> 14:06.846
<i>- He told me</i>
<i>his name was JJ,</i>

14:06.847 --> 14:07.846
<i>and he seemed like</i>
<i>my best shot</i>

14:07.847 --> 14:09.846
<i>at getting a big sale</i>
<i>for Emily,</i>

14:09.847 --> 14:12.846
<i>but for this to work,</i>
<i>I needed to get him drunk</i>

14:12.847 --> 14:13.846
<i>while staying</i>
<i>sober enough myself</i>

14:13.847 --> 14:15.846
<i>to execute the plan,</i>

14:15.847 --> 14:18.846
<i>so prior to my arrival,</i>
<i>I had a vacuum-powered device</i>

14:18.847 --> 14:20.846
<i>sewn into the lining</i>
<i>of my jacket</i>

14:20.847 --> 14:22.846
<i>that was designed</i>
<i>to discreetly suck up</i>

14:22.847 --> 14:24.846
<i>the alcohol I was served</i>
<i>through a tube,</i>

14:24.847 --> 14:26.846
<i>into a pouch</i>
<i>on my back.</i>

14:26.847 --> 14:28.846
<i>Then a second motor</i>
<i>would deliver apple juice</i>

14:28.847 --> 14:31.846
<i>from a different pouch,</i>
<i>quickly refilling the glass</i>

14:31.847 --> 14:34.846
<i>and allowing me to go</i>
<i>shot-for-shot with JJ</i>

14:34.847 --> 14:35.846
<i>without losing my focus</i>
<i>one bit.</i>

14:35.847 --> 14:37.846
- Cheers.

14:37.847 --> 14:38.846
<i>- Over the course</i>
<i>of the next hour,</i>

14:38.847 --> 14:39.846
<i>we had several rounds,</i>

14:39.847 --> 14:42.846
<i>and I noticed that JJ</i>
<i>was getting pretty tipsy.</i>

14:42.847 --> 14:45.846
- My roommates put this
piece of paper in my pocket.

14:45.847 --> 14:47.846
Like, "Just in case you get
too drunk and get lost tonight."

14:47.847 --> 14:49.846
- That's your address?
- [laughs] Yeah.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.846
- They put a piece of paper

14:50.847 --> 14:52.846
with your address
in your pocket?

14:52.847 --> 14:54.846
So you get drunk often.

14:54.847 --> 14:55.846
- Oh, yeah.

14:55.847 --> 14:56.846
- Really drunk.
- Every night.

14:56.847 --> 14:59.846
<i>- And I felt that we were</i>
<i>finally ready to head out.</i>

14:59.847 --> 15:01.846
<i>I explained to him</i>
<i>that the cameras were there</i>

15:01.847 --> 15:04.846
<i>for a documentary</i>
<i>about nightlife in Long Beach,</i>

15:04.847 --> 15:06.846
<i>but in reality,</i>
<i>my only goal</i>

15:06.847 --> 15:08.846
<i>was to get him</i>
<i>inside the antique shop.</i>

15:08.847 --> 15:12.846
<i>There was just one more step</i>
<i>I had to take to get him ready.</i>

15:12.847 --> 15:14.846
There's this costume party
in the area that--

15:14.847 --> 15:16.846
- A costume party?

15:16.847 --> 15:17.846
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

15:17.847 --> 15:19.846
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

15:19.847 --> 15:21.846
<i>- Safety is always</i>
<i>my number one priority,</i>

15:21.847 --> 15:24.846
<i>so I came up with the idea</i>
<i>of a costume party</i>

15:24.847 --> 15:26.846
<i>as a way to get JJ</i>
<i>into a padded outfit</i>

15:26.847 --> 15:28.846
<i>that would protect him</i>

15:28.847 --> 15:30.846
<i>against any antiques</i>
<i>he might shatter</i>

15:30.847 --> 15:31.846
<i>once he stumbled</i>
<i>into Emily's store.</i>

15:31.847 --> 15:32.846
- Cool--oh.
- Oh, shit.

15:32.847 --> 15:34.846
- Ow, [bleep]!

15:34.847 --> 15:36.846
<i>And with that, we headed out</i>
<i>to my made-up party.</i>

15:36.847 --> 15:38.846
<i>I just hoped I could</i>
<i>convince him</i>

15:38.847 --> 15:41.846
<i>to make a stop</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

15:41.847 --> 15:44.846
Oh, sweet, look.
Open 24 hours.

15:44.847 --> 15:46.846
- What is it?

15:46.847 --> 15:48.846
- Looks like some sort
of store, but look.

15:48.847 --> 15:50.846
- Free p--
- Free pizza.

15:50.847 --> 15:52.846
- Do you see it?
It's right back there.

15:52.847 --> 15:54.846
It's right there at the back
by a heat lamp.

15:54.847 --> 15:56.846
- Let's go.
- All right.

15:56.847 --> 15:57.846
- You're coming with me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:57.847 --> 16:00.847
<i>[doorbell ringing]</i>

16:03.847 --> 16:05.847
- [groans]

16:08.847 --> 16:09.846
Ooh.
<i>[dishes clattering]</i>

16:09.847 --> 16:10.846
Uh--

16:10.847 --> 16:11.846
- You okay, man?

16:11.847 --> 16:13.846
- I'm all right
right now.

16:13.847 --> 16:14.846
- All right.
You better be careful.

16:14.847 --> 16:16.847
- It's all right.

16:21.847 --> 16:26.846
- Watch your back.

16:26.847 --> 16:27.846
- There's no way.
- Should--

16:27.847 --> 16:29.846
- I can't even fit through that.
It's too tight.

16:29.847 --> 16:32.847
- Well, what do you--I mean,
do you want the pizza or what?

16:35.847 --> 16:37.846
- I'm kind of wedged here.

16:37.847 --> 16:39.846
- You broke this stuff.
- Right, I see that,

16:39.847 --> 16:40.846
and that's why I'm, like,
eh, I don't really want

16:40.847 --> 16:43.846
to break anymore 'cause
it's [bleep] super expensive.

16:43.847 --> 16:45.846
- You have a "you break it,
you buy it" policy?

16:45.847 --> 16:47.846
- Yeah.

16:47.847 --> 16:49.846
<i>- The plan was a success.</i>

16:49.847 --> 16:53.846
<i>JJ had destroyed</i>
<i>a large selection of antiques,</i>

16:53.847 --> 16:55.846
<i>and once he freed himself</i>
<i>from the aisle,</i>

16:55.847 --> 16:58.846
<i>all Emily had to do was</i>
<i>catalogue the broken items...</i>

16:58.847 --> 17:01.846
- You're pretty clumsy,
huh?

17:01.847 --> 17:03.846
- Is there any way I can
take this thing off?

17:03.847 --> 17:04.846
<i>- And ring up the sale.</i>

17:04.847 --> 17:07.847
- It's about $280
worth of damage,

17:09.847 --> 17:11.846
and that's probably
getting off easy

17:11.847 --> 17:11.847
'cause I couldn't really assess
all of that broken--

17:11.848 --> 17:13.846
- Right.

17:13.847 --> 17:14.846
[laughs]
- Boo.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.846
<i>- So with that, Emily</i>
<i>got to make a sizable sale.</i>

17:17.847 --> 17:18.846
Well, lesson learned,
huh?

17:18.847 --> 17:20.846
- Right.
- Sorry.

17:20.847 --> 17:22.846
<i>- And JJ even got to take home</i>
<i>some antiques.</i>

17:22.847 --> 17:25.846
If you look at it this way,
it looks like it's brand-new.

17:25.847 --> 17:26.846
- Right.

17:26.847 --> 17:28.846
- So...

17:28.847 --> 17:29.846
it's kind of a blessing
in disguise.

17:29.847 --> 17:30.846
- Right, right, right.

17:30.847 --> 17:33.846
<i>- I was so happy</i>
<i>everything worked out,</i>

17:33.847 --> 17:36.846
<i>and Emily seemed</i>
<i>really won over by the idea,</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:37.846
<i>but as we left</i>
<i>the store,</i>

17:37.847 --> 17:40.846
<i>I noticed that JJ</i>
<i>was still pretty drunk,</i>

17:40.847 --> 17:42.846
<i>and since he made</i>
<i>such a big purchase,</i>

17:42.847 --> 17:44.846
<i>I felt the least I could do</i>
<i>was be a gentleman</i>

17:44.847 --> 17:46.846
<i>and give him</i>
<i>a ride home.</i>

17:46.847 --> 17:48.846
Do you often do
stuff like that

17:48.847 --> 17:49.846
without really
thinking it through?

17:49.847 --> 17:51.846
- Um, yeah.

17:51.847 --> 17:53.846
<i>- As we drove</i>
<i>to JJ's apartment,</i>

17:53.847 --> 17:55.846
<i>I thought my night</i>
<i>was over,</i>

17:55.847 --> 17:56.846
<i>but that's when he started</i>
<i>talking to me</i>

17:56.847 --> 17:57.846
<i>about his sex life.</i>

17:57.847 --> 17:58.846
- Tag team a girl, yeah.

17:58.847 --> 18:00.846
- Tag team a girl?

18:00.847 --> 18:01.846
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what's that?

18:01.847 --> 18:04.846
- It's when you have a threesome
with two guys and one girl.

18:04.847 --> 18:05.846
- And you do that?
- Yeah.

18:05.847 --> 18:07.846
- Yeah, yeah.

18:07.847 --> 18:08.846
- I do it with my brother
a lot, actually.

18:08.847 --> 18:10.846
- Oh, really?
- Me and my brother are dogs.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.846
<i>- JJ began</i>
<i>going into detail</i>

18:12.847 --> 18:14.846
<i>about the threesomes</i>
<i>he has with his brother,</i>

18:14.847 --> 18:17.846
<i>and that that point, I really</i>
<i>just wanted to get home,</i>

18:17.847 --> 18:18.846
<i>but when I</i>
<i>dropped him off,</i>

18:18.847 --> 18:20.846
<i>he insisted</i>
<i>that I meet the guy,</i>

18:20.847 --> 18:22.846
<i>so I waited outside</i>
<i>as JJ went in</i>

18:22.847 --> 18:25.768
<i>and brought out</i>
<i>his brother.</i>

18:25.847 --> 18:27.846
You guys have sex
with the same girl.

18:27.847 --> 18:28.846
- Yeah.
[both laughing]

18:28.847 --> 18:30.846
- I told him about--
I told him about tag team.

18:30.847 --> 18:32.846
- Yeah.
- I told him.

18:32.847 --> 18:33.846
- So you guys
are brothers?

18:33.847 --> 18:34.847
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

18:36.847 --> 18:38.846
- And you guys, you'll have sex
with the same girl?

18:38.847 --> 18:40.846
- Mm-hmm.

18:40.847 --> 18:41.846
- Shit, I'll be
[bleep] a girl

18:41.847 --> 18:44.846
when he's [bleep] a girl
right next to me.

18:44.847 --> 18:47.846
Two...even, like.

18:47.847 --> 18:49.846
- And then you're looking
at each other during it?

18:49.847 --> 18:51.846
- No.
- It's dark in the room.

18:51.847 --> 18:53.846
Lights are off all the way,
and you don't see shit.

18:53.847 --> 18:55.846
- It's fine.

18:55.847 --> 18:56.846
- But if you're not looking
at each other,

18:56.847 --> 18:57.846
and you're having sex
with a girl,

18:57.847 --> 18:59.846
why not just one of you
do it,

18:59.847 --> 19:01.846
and then the next one
does it later?

19:01.847 --> 19:02.846
- 'Cause it's something we do,
it's [bleep]--

19:02.847 --> 19:04.846
- Right, it's just
something we've done.

19:04.847 --> 19:08.846
I mean, all my homeboys
from back in Ohio, they do it.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.846
Everybody does this shit,
Max, [bleep] George.

19:10.847 --> 19:12.846
- J-squad.
Shout out to J-squad, you--

19:12.847 --> 19:16.846
- Shout out to that J-squad.
- J-squad.

19:16.847 --> 19:18.846
- I mean, the one--
I do look at you guys,

19:18.847 --> 19:21.846
and a part of me is envious
that, you know,

19:21.847 --> 19:24.846
I don't have someone in my life
that is--I'm this close with.

19:24.847 --> 19:26.846
- [snorts and spits]

19:26.847 --> 19:28.846
- It's nice to see
brotherly love

19:28.847 --> 19:30.846
taken to that level,
in a way.

19:30.847 --> 19:31.846
- Yeah, I definitely see
where you're coming from.

19:31.847 --> 19:33.846
- It's just--
- And, like, you know--

19:33.847 --> 19:36.846
- To us, it's just, like--
it's nothing.

19:36.847 --> 19:39.846
- It's just, like, that's what
[bleep] we're used to.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.846
We're used to all this shit.
- Right.

19:42.847 --> 19:44.846
- It's great meeting you.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:44.847 --> 19:45.846
- All right, man.

19:45.847 --> 19:46.846
- See you, guys.
- Yup.

19:46.847 --> 19:46.847
- All right, buddy, yup.

19:48.853 --> 19:51.352
<i>- With a successful night</i>
<i>under our belt,</i>

19:51.353 --> 19:52.352
<i>I could finally return</i>
<i>to Magnolia and Willow</i>

19:52.353 --> 19:55.352
<i>to get Emily's thoughts</i>
<i>on how it went.</i>

19:55.353 --> 19:56.352
I mean, that's a pretty big
sale, right?

19:56.353 --> 19:59.352
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
definitely, it helps, yeah.

19:59.353 --> 20:00.352
- So how'd you feel about that?
That's--

20:00.353 --> 20:01.352
- It's good, yeah,
and, you know,

20:01.353 --> 20:03.352
any time we're moving...
- Great, right?

20:03.353 --> 20:05.352
- Any product, it's always
beneficial to the store, so--

20:05.353 --> 20:06.352
- That was a lot
of product.

20:06.353 --> 20:07.352
- Yeah, I mean,
it was good.

20:07.353 --> 20:08.352
It's just kind of awkward...
- Definitely.

20:08.353 --> 20:11.352
- Having people
that might be

20:11.353 --> 20:12.352
having a little too much
to drink.

20:12.353 --> 20:14.352
It's a little harder
to control in your store,

20:14.353 --> 20:15.352
that kind of thing.

20:15.353 --> 20:16.352
- Well, a sale's a sale.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.352
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, definitely.

20:17.353 --> 20:19.352
- Yeah.

20:19.353 --> 20:21.352
- All right.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.352
- Yeah, thank you for all
your help and your suggestions.

20:23.353 --> 20:24.352
This is all really great.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.352
- Mm-hmm.
- Good experience to try it.

20:26.353 --> 20:27.352
Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:27.353 --> 20:28.352
- Have a good day.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.352
- Yeah, you--
no, you too.

20:30.353 --> 20:32.352

21:00.292 --> 21:02.091
- If you're just
glancing at that picture,

21:02.092 --> 21:03.091
you cannot tell
that was done in Photoshop.

21:03.092 --> 21:05.092
You would think that was
an actual picture.

- Yeah, yeah.

that was done in Photoshop.
