Oh, they're perfect for a ball.

11:26.108 --> 11:30.733
OK, my dear. You're ready
to go to Prince Mickey's ball.

11:31.025 --> 11:32.942
But how will I get there?

11:33.025 --> 11:36.108
Well, now, let me see...

11:36.192 --> 11:38.608
What we need is a pumpkin.

11:39.567 --> 11:42.275

11:42.358 --> 11:44.775
♪ Doodly-doody-doo ♪

11:45.067 --> 11:48.525
Goofy, I'm so glad to find you.

11:48.608 --> 11:53.525
Golly, it's a fairy godmother
and a princess.

11:53.775 --> 11:55.233
Howdy, my ladies.

11:55.442 --> 11:57.233
Do you need some help?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.233
We certainly do.

11:59.317 --> 12:03.275
Minnie-rella and I need
the biggest pumpkin in your garden.

12:03.358 --> 12:06.067
Sorry, uh, uh,
pumpkins are out of season,

12:06.150 --> 12:08.858
but I've got some lovely tomaters.

12:08.942 --> 12:11.233
Well, I guess that'll have to do.

12:11.317 --> 12:13.567
One tomater coming up.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.692
Here you go.

12:16.317 --> 12:18.400
Stupendous.

12:18.483 --> 12:21.108
This tomato will make a fine carriage.

12:21.483 --> 12:24.692
With a wave of my stick,
this should do the trick.

12:24.775 --> 12:27.067
Giggly-googly-grow!

12:44.108 --> 12:47.192
-Gawrsh.
-Oh, it's beautiful!

12:47.567 --> 12:50.067
And now for you, Goofy.

12:50.150 --> 12:53.983
We need a coachman to drive Minnie-rella
to Prince Mickey's ball.

12:54.442 --> 12:56.525
Okey-dokey.

12:56.608 --> 12:58.483
Zippity-bippity-bow.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.942
You'll be dressed up from head to toe.

13:01.025 --> 13:03.525
[giggles] That tickles.

13:04.942 --> 13:06.358
Handsome.

13:06.442 --> 13:08.692
Hurry, my dear, it's getting late.

13:08.775 --> 13:10.650
Prince Mickey's ball can't wait.

13:14.692 --> 13:17.567
All wound up and ready to go. [chuckles]

13:18.233 --> 13:19.608
Wonderful!

13:19.692 --> 13:21.733
[sighs] Oh, but I almost forgot.

13:21.817 --> 13:25.983
Minnie-rella,
you must leave the ball by 12:00.

13:26.067 --> 13:30.108
That's when both hands on the cuckoo clock
point to the number 12.

13:30.525 --> 13:32.108
OK, I will.

13:32.192 --> 13:35.192
Remember now, it's very important.

13:35.275 --> 13:38.608
You see, at 12:00,
the spell will be broken

13:38.692 --> 13:42.358
and everything will turn back
to what it was before...

13:42.442 --> 13:44.150
or something like that.

13:44.483 --> 13:47.150
I promise to remember. Good-bye!

13:48.692 --> 13:49.733

Gawrsh, the carriage wheel
sure is stuck.

14:26.358 --> 14:29.108
How are we gonna get
to Prince Mickey's ball now?

14:29.192 --> 14:31.108
With a little help from Qoodles.

14:31.192 --> 14:32.650
Everybody say,

14:32.733 --> 14:35.108
[sing-song] "Oh, Qoodles!"

14:35.192 --> 14:38.233
[sing-song] Oh, Qoodles!

14:39.358 --> 14:42.317
Hop-hop-happy to help you.

14:46.983 --> 14:50.983
[Minnie] Let's see.
We have a pillow, Hilda the baby hippo,

14:51.067 --> 14:53.817
and the Mystery Qoodles-tool.

14:53.900 --> 14:56.858
Which Qoodles-tool is strong enough
to help us push the carriage

14:56.942 --> 14:58.608
and get the wheel unstuck?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.692
[Goofy] Hmm, maybe the baby hippo
is strong enough.

15:05.108 --> 15:06.317
[Minnie] Let's find out.

15:06.900 --> 15:11.025
Oh! We've got ears, say "Cheers."

15:14.983 --> 15:16.483
Hiya, Hilda.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.400
Could you push the carriage
and help us get unstuck?

15:19.483 --> 15:21.108
[giggles]

15:25.067 --> 15:27.733
Gawrsh. How'd she do that?

15:27.817 --> 15:29.858
She's super strong.

15:29.900 --> 15:31.233
Thank you, Hilda.

15:38.692 --> 15:41.400
Next stop: Prince Mickey's castle.

16:00.858 --> 16:03.567
Greetings, hello, and how's by you?

16:03.650 --> 16:06.900
I'm Pete, the royal gatekeeper.

16:06.983 --> 16:09.567
Welcome to Mickey's castle, one and all.

16:09.650 --> 16:12.483
Get ready to dance and swing at the ball.

16:12.567 --> 16:14.775
-Ooh.
-How exciting.

16:14.858 --> 16:18.775
There's only one teeny-tiny problem,
my lady and my gentleman.

16:18.858 --> 16:20.275
We're locked out.

16:20.358 --> 16:23.608
And I don't have any more little shapes
to unlock the gate.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.192
What kind of shapes?

16:25.275 --> 16:29.733
Well, to open the gate,
we need three diamond shapes.

16:29.817 --> 16:31.983
Maybe I've got some in my hat.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.317
[humming]

16:35.150 --> 16:36.733
Hmm, no diamonds,

16:36.817 --> 16:39.067
but I found a pickle. [chuckles]

16:39.150 --> 16:41.608
Pickle-shmickle.
If we can't unlock the gate,

16:41.692 --> 16:44.067
you can't get in and dance
at Prince Mickey's ball.

16:44.317 --> 16:46.650
Oh. But we came all this way.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.192
Don't worry, Minnie-rella.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.067
I bet one of them Qoodly-toodlies
can help us.

16:51.150 --> 16:53.733
[giggles] Good idea, Goofy.

16:53.817 --> 16:55.192
Everybody say,

16:55.275 --> 16:57.442
[sing-song] "Oh, Qoodles!"

16:57.525 --> 17:00.233
[sing-song] Oh, Qoodles!

17:00.317 --> 17:03.275
Qoodles to the rescue!

17:07.025 --> 17:12.025
[Minnie] Hmm, we've got a pillow
and the Mystery Qoodles-tool.

17:12.108 --> 17:15.525
Which Qoodles-tool can we use
to unlock the gate?

17:17.192 --> 17:19.358
[Pete] Well, I don't think
that pillow will help us.

17:19.442 --> 17:21.150
It's shaped like a heart.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.400
[Minnie]
Let's try the Mystery Qoodles-tool.

17:23.525 --> 17:24.817
Everybody say,

17:24.900 --> 17:27.192
"Mystery Qoodles-tool!"

[all] Mystery Qoodles-tool!

17:30.150 --> 17:33.525
[Minnie]
And today's Mystery Qoodles-tool is...

17:34.442 --> 17:36.692
[Pete] A charm bracelet!

17:36.775 --> 17:40.442
[Minnie] We've got ears, say "Cheers!"

17:43.442 --> 17:45.025
[Pete] Charming.

17:45.108 --> 17:48.400
Look, the charm bracelet
has different shapes on it.

17:48.483 --> 17:50.358
Let's pick out the diamond shapes.

17:50.608 --> 17:52.858
We need three diamonds.

17:52.942 --> 17:55.192
Is this a diamond shape?

17:55.858 --> 17:58.025
Yes! But we need three,

17:58.108 --> 18:01.400
so help me pick out
two more diamond shapes.

18:03.733 --> 18:07.025
Right. There's one, two more.

18:07.108 --> 18:08.358
Here you go, Pete.

18:08.442 --> 18:12.150
One, two, three diamond shapes.

18:19.358 --> 18:20.900
Well, what do you know?

18:20.983 --> 18:24.442
Those fancy shapes worked like a charm.
[laughs]

18:24.525 --> 18:26.858
I'll wait for you here, Minnie-rella.

18:26.942 --> 18:31.275
Uh, what did the fairy godmother tell us
to remember about the spell?

18:31.358 --> 18:33.775
I must leave the ball by 12:00

18:33.858 --> 18:35.942
because that's when the spell wears off

18:36.025 --> 18:38.775
and everything goes back
to the way it was.

18:39.025 --> 18:41.858
Have fun at the ball, my lady.

It was that pretty princess

how to find her.

21:54.442 --> 21:56.192
As your royal advisor,

21:56.275 --> 22:01.733
I advise you to find the mystery princess
and find her very fast.

22:01.817 --> 22:06.733
Just find the one who fits
the slipper made of glass.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.192
We haven't searched down this road yet.

But, uh, what happened to Minnie-rella?

22:25.608 --> 22:29.567
Gawrsh, here comes the prince
and his princely pup, Pluto.

22:30.108 --> 22:32.150

Whoa. Ow, whoa!

22:37.358 --> 22:40.275
May I be of service to your Highness?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.858
We're searching the kingdom
for a princess.

22:43.233 --> 22:46.817
All the princess left behind
is this glass slipper.

22:46.900 --> 22:51.775
To find her, everybody in the land
has got to try it on and see if it fits.

22:52.108 --> 22:53.983
Okey-dokey.

22:55.692 --> 22:57.400
[grunting]

[Goofy] Golly, it looks like
all we've got left is a pillow.

Can we use the soft pillow
to catch the slipper?

23:35.525 --> 23:37.567
I think we can!

one fancy dancing shoe.

Thank you. I just hope
I can find the princess who lost it.

sure does look familiar.
