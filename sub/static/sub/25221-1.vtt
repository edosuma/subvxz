01:22.769 --> 01:23.769
There you are.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.711
Come on Sammy we have to go.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.606
- Yes go.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.922
- Madison, Sammy.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.424
- I found him Mom.

01:31.634 --> 01:34.595
- Both of you out
in the car, hurry.

01:37.223 --> 01:39.451
You won't last one week...

01:39.475 --> 01:40.475
- Hurry up.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.746
I'll be right there.

01:42.770 --> 01:43.770
- Mom.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.749
- Madison it'll be alright.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.942
Take care of your brother.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.070
- Come on Sammy let's go.

01:52.363 --> 01:53.443
Where is that other bottle?

01:53.697 --> 01:54.697
- Away.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.631
Don't tell me I don't
need another bottle.

01:57.655 --> 01:58.637
Now I am a grown man.

01:58.661 --> 01:59.930
- Come on Sammy.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.224
Don't be afraid I'll help you.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.958
Sammy what are you doing?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.270
Sammy listen to me.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.815
- I drink two bottles
thank you very much.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.858
You'd probably drink
one on your own too.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.800
You know if you would just like

02:13.801 --> 02:16.303
share with me once in awhile
it wouldn't be that bad.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.820
Hey, where are you going?

02:34.363 --> 02:36.991
Who said you could take my car?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.808
- Right here Mom.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.833
- Buckle up.

02:47.418 --> 02:49.420
- Mom he's coming.

02:55.593 --> 02:56.844
Mom I think you hit him.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.846
- No just stunned.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.349
- Well that worked out nicely.

03:05.853 --> 03:06.979
Are you guys okay?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.690
- I'm fine.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.359
I got my shoes Mom.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.963
You're shoes?

03:14.987 --> 03:17.030
You're fine 'cause you have
those stinky old shoes?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.197
- I got my shoes.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.010
- Don't listen to her Samuel.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.076
I'm glad too.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.330
I'm glad you have your shoes.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.313
- Madison what is
wrong with you?

04:13.337 --> 04:14.587
- I'm sorry Roy.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.607
Are you alright?

04:15.631 --> 04:16.524
- Put it in park.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.050
- Oh right, sorry.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.072
- Do you even have a license
to drive this thing?

04:22.096 --> 04:25.116
- Of course I do it's
just that driving

04:25.140 --> 04:28.286
deficiencies sort of
run in the family.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.310
- No doubt.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.415
- I'm really late.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.983
- Not as late as I
could have been.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.197
The late Roy, I get it funny.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.534
Smile.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.763
- No stop that.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.014
- Oh come on Roy.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.288
You know you're one of
my favorite subjects.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.434
Besides you love having
your picture taken.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.852
- I do not.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.672
And another thing Madison,
is that your doing?

04:59.508 --> 05:02.970
- Have I told you how
nice your mums look?

05:04.388 --> 05:08.994
- Yes, the last time you
tried to change the subject.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.603
- I'll pick up a new trash can.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.479
- Whoa.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.918
- Don't worry I've got this.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.317
- And don't forget the rent.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.821
- You have a good day too Roy.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.240
- Artists.

05:52.394 --> 05:56.541
- The photography of local
artist Madison Gray.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.026
Now if I could only
finish the photos.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.337
Did I say that out loud?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.738
- Loud and clear.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.492
- Morning boss.

06:07.993 --> 06:11.514
Well as your boss and the name
that is on the gallery...

06:11.538 --> 06:15.060
- The Palmer Gallery, the
best in the Midwest.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.710
- It is my job to make
sure our artisans

06:17.711 --> 06:20.379
are making their deadlines.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.550
- You do a fantastic
job of that Joan.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.893
- Come with me, come on.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.738
Madison do you see this wall?

06:46.115 --> 06:47.406
- Every day.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.576
- Good let that be a
reminder to you that

06:50.577 --> 06:53.831
unless I can fill 16
feet of wall space

06:54.915 --> 06:56.601
with paint and call
it photography

06:56.625 --> 06:59.896
I'm gonna need you to
fill it with pictures.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.148
- I will I promise.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.342
I'm almost finished
I'm just tweaking.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.761
- Tweak faster.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.910
- Joan I wanted to thank you for

07:13.934 --> 07:16.037
this opportunity
you're giving me.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.436
Ever since I started
to work here

07:17.437 --> 07:20.333
I've dreamed of
having my own show.

07:20.357 --> 07:25.088
- If I wouldn't have given it to
you my competitors would have.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.174
Madison you're very talented.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.284
One of the best I've seen
in a very long time.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.452
Well since me.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.599
But seriously.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.310
Sometimes you just need
to mat it and frame it.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.460
- I just want it to be perfect.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
- Perfection

07:43.714 --> 07:45.215
can be petrifying.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.094
Come on let's get to work.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.408
Thank you.

07:53.432 --> 07:56.310
- Ooh Madison I made
some coffee, want some?

07:57.853 --> 07:59.646
- Coming right up.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.518
- 16 feet.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.996
Saved by the bell.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.624
Hello.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.254
Yes this is Madison Gray.

09:08.632 --> 09:09.632
What?

09:12.302 --> 09:13.302
When?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.554
How?

09:24.898 --> 09:27.276
- The best part of waking up.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.071
Madison what is it?

09:42.582 --> 09:47.105
- Jesus said I am the
resurrection and I am the life.

09:47.129 --> 09:51.401
Those who believe in me
even though they die

09:51.425 --> 09:53.736
yet they will live.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.931
And those who live and believe
in me will never die.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.246
Let us live our lives
with the certain hope

10:03.270 --> 10:05.540
of being reunited
with our sister Mary

10:05.564 --> 10:09.294
and all believers
at the end of time.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.944
And may the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

10:11.945 --> 10:16.342
the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit

10:16.366 --> 10:19.119
be with you now
and always, amen.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.293
I'm very sorry Sam.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.303
- It's time to go Sam.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.014
- In a minute okay.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.300
- Madison again I am so sorry.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.260
- Thank you Pastor James.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.845
- It was so sudden.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.056
Is there any word
on how Mary died?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.831
- It appears to be
a heart attack.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.360
Sam found her when he came home

11:15.384 --> 11:18.345
after his job at
the grocery store.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.409
I just don't know why God
would let this happen to us.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.454
- God's reasons are not
always clear in the present.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.438
- And everything works for
the good of God's plan.

11:28.462 --> 11:31.465
I've heard the sermon
before Pastor.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.838
But what good could
come from this?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.591
- Well I pray that you
and Sam find peace.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.615
- Yeah.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.534
Me too.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.539
Are you praying?

11:49.835 --> 11:52.397
- We'll miss Sam around here.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.942
Our church has a sister
congregation in Fort Barber.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.693
Here's the contact information.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.717
- Thanks.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.680
I better go get Sam.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.145
Sammy, it's time to go.

12:09.896 --> 12:10.939
- Time to go.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.506
- God be with you Sam.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.427
- Pastor James my mom is dead.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.846
- I know Sam.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.453
- These are my moms shoes.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.980
They are very fine shoes Sammy.

12:52.939 --> 12:53.939
- Mom is

12:55.400 --> 12:57.753
in the big shoe box.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.571
- Well yes Sam she is.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.285
Her body is but her
soul is in Heaven.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.301
- Bye Pastor.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.821
- Goodbye Sam.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.845
Madison.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.284
Sam doesn't like change.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.077
- No kidding.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.311
- Consistency is
important to him.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.499
- Yeah well looks
like God took care of

13:34.523 --> 13:38.777
there being any consistancy
in our lives didn't he?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.894

14:14.896 --> 14:15.896

17:55.742 --> 17:58.179
Don't touch my camera.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.443
Gonna have trouble enough
getting my photos done in time.

18:01.391 --> 18:02.391
- The gallery show.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.225
- Well let me help you.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.793
- Sam no, Sam, Sam!

18:06.544 --> 18:07.796
- Now look what you did.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.025
Sam just get away
from the camera.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.550
Just go, just sit.

18:21.769 --> 18:22.769

18:22.770 --> 18:24.436
- You're lying.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.290
- I think I'm making it worse.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.106
- I know how you feel.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.442
I do that a lot.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.381
Don't worry about it.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.074
I have other lenses.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.314
- Your movies stink.

19:10.525 --> 19:14.255
Alright, we could play
some cards, go fish?

19:14.279 --> 19:16.154
- I'm hungry.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.326
- Hungry, I guess it is
past dinner time isn't it?

19:21.703 --> 19:24.372
Okay well let's see what we got.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.130
We got some carrots, no.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.182
Tomato soup.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.330
I'll tell you what.

19:48.354 --> 19:53.002
How 'bout we go pick up a
pizza and grab a movie?

19:53.026 --> 19:57.362
You could pick out any
movie that you like.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.199
What is the matter
with that door?

20:01.845 --> 20:02.845
Sam what are you doing?

20:02.869 --> 20:03.888
- Open.

20:03.912 --> 20:04.847
What?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.039
- The door it needs to be open.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.894
- No, there's no reason
for it to be open.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.312
- Open the door.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.711
- No.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.712
Sam.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.012
No.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.056
Sam.

20:29.414 --> 20:30.414
Stop it.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.540
- Open the door!

20:31.564 --> 20:32.565
- Sam no.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.921
- Okay it can stay closed.

20:36.945 --> 20:37.945
- Hi Roy.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.948
Did we disturb you?

20:41.366 --> 20:44.553
You could have woken the dead.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.577
Sorry.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.143
I am very sorry to hear
about your mother Madison.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.478
It's awful just awful.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.086
- Thanks.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.106
This is my brother Sam.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.466
Sam this is Roy my landlord.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.945
- Well hello Sam.

21:00.969 --> 21:01.969
- Nine.

21:02.887 --> 21:03.888
Nine.

21:05.116 --> 21:06.116
What is he German?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.892
- No it's your shoes.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.080
What about my shoes?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.438
- They're a size nine.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.442
- Shoes are kind of his thing.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.213
- I have no idea.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.823
We'll be more quiet, right Sam.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.118
- See that you do.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.596
- Goodnight Roy.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.621
- Goodnight.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.003

22:40.234 --> 22:42.796
- Sam, what are you
doing in here?

22:42.820 --> 22:43.714
- It's time to get up.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.073
- It's 7:00 a.m.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.343
Did you mess with my phone?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.555
- You've had the same
password since you were 13.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.223
Come on we're gonna be late.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.892
- It's Sunday, what
are we late for?

22:54.916 --> 22:55.916
- Church.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.770
- The service is at eight.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.670
I'll let you get ready.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.404
Come on we're gonna be late.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.491
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

23:33.264 --> 23:34.264
Good morning.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.289
- Thank you.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.695
- Here let me take
your backpack.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.603
- Sam it's okay.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.380
- I'll take good
care of it okay?

23:43.589 --> 23:44.757
- Come on Sam.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.320
- This doesn't look
like my church.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.013
- A church is a church, come on.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.765
Excuse us.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.114
Sam.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.118
I'm so sorry.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.559
Sam why didn't you follow me?

24:18.583 --> 24:19.393
- She smelled funny.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.435
- Sam that's not polite.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.770
- Like stinky flowers.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.688
- It's perfume.

24:22.712 --> 24:23.564
- It's giving me a headache.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.797
- Okay fine.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.471
- I'm Sam.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.408
- Hey I'm...

24:34.432 --> 24:36.976
- No turn around, pay attention.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.082
- Good morning everyone and
welcome to our service.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.691
- Thank you pastor.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.670
- We begin our worship
in the name of

24:46.694 --> 24:49.673
the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.697
- Amen.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.991
- Amen.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.263
Let us join together in
singing our first hymn.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.287
Number 334.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.603
- Sam.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.627
Sam.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.950
- Why are they
closing the doors?

25:05.974 --> 25:07.267
- Sam it's okay.

25:08.693 --> 25:09.693
- Open the door.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.486
- Sam sit down.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.054
Sam look at me Sam.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.230
- I have to go to the bathroom.

25:29.612 --> 25:33.699
♪ Praise our Father
Lord that we ♪

25:47.129 --> 25:48.129
- Sam.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.176
You alright?

25:53.552 --> 25:54.637
- I'm hungry.

25:55.805 --> 25:56.805
- Okay.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.769
We don't belong here, let's go.

26:21.789 --> 26:22.873
- Yes please.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.673
Actually you can just leave
the bottle, thank you.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.074
- This brunch is
great, thanks Madison.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.098
- Sure.

26:51.485 --> 26:54.238
So, what did you
think of church?

26:55.531 --> 26:56.615
- Not like home.

26:58.743 --> 26:59.951
- Different.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.455
- Church is church Sam
how is it different?

27:03.456 --> 27:05.517
- Worship at the cross.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.935
- I don't understand.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.729
- Worship at the cross.

27:08.753 --> 27:11.064
Pastor James had a service.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.026
- We were just at a service
or almost at a service.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.634
- No a service for
me and my friends.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.303
- A service for you
and your friends?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.656
Oh a service for...

27:19.680 --> 27:22.475
- Yeah a service
for slow people.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.580
- Sam that's not what
I was going to say.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.123
- That's what you were thinking.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.427
That's what
everybody's thinking.

27:29.451 --> 27:30.584
- Sam.

27:30.608 --> 27:31.835
- It's like wearing your
insides on your outside.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.419
When people look at
me they don't see me

27:33.443 --> 27:35.563
they see my problems and they
don't look me in the eye

27:35.587 --> 27:39.051
because then they might have
to admit I'm an actual person.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.803
Sometimes I think what I've
got is catchy like the flu

27:41.827 --> 27:43.495
and if they get too close to me

27:43.496 --> 27:45.557
they might wake up
with what I've got.

27:45.581 --> 27:49.085
Then the short bus will
come for them too.

27:51.462 --> 27:52.463
I miss home.

27:53.381 --> 27:54.715
- I know you do.

27:56.217 --> 27:58.344
But this is our home now.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.184
Trying to make it work for us.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.234
- Everybody drinks.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.172
- It's just a little
bubbly with brunch.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.697
- It's your third glass.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.493
I'm a big girl Sam I can
take care of myself.

28:26.247 --> 28:27.248
- Yes I can.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.009
- Good morning Madison.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.142
- We're adjusting.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.666
Oh this is my brother Sam.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.168
Sam this is Joan my boss
at the art gallery.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.192
- Hi Sam.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.882
- I like your shoes.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.175
- Thanks.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.575
- You're welcome.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.387
- Well you passed inspection.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.411
- Good.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.598
That is good right?

29:08.622 --> 29:10.767
Madison I've been thinking.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.231
With everything going
on in your life

29:12.255 --> 29:16.884
I think maybe we should
cancel the gallery show.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.611
- Postpone it just until
things level out a little.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.471
- I'm almost finished.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.284
- Really there's no
need to postpone.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.267
- I just think you
need time to regroup

29:29.268 --> 29:32.330
and get used to
your new situation.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.166
- But I'm planning on
coming in tomorrow.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.275
You can see my progress.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.296
- Sam's great on his own.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.547
He does it all the time.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.507
There's plenty for him
to do at the apartment.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.092
Right Sam?

29:44.116 --> 29:44.926
- No.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.785
- He means no problem.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.498
- Well I'll hold off for now.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.436
Let's see what you have
and then I'll decide.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.628
- Thanks Joan.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.714
- But it can wait Madison.

30:01.759 --> 30:02.759
- No.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.802
It can't.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.806
- It was very nice
to meet you Sam.

30:08.807 --> 30:09.807
- Bye.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.040
- I'll be right back.

30:54.228 --> 30:55.520
What?

30:55.521 --> 30:59.042
- Some people wear their
problems on the outside

30:59.066 --> 31:02.403
for everyone to see,
some keep them hidden.

31:03.696 --> 31:04.881
And who would that be?

31:04.905 --> 31:05.840
- You.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.075
- Well Doctor Sam I'm fine.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.370
Just leave me alone.

31:15.749 --> 31:16.749
- I can't.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.381
- Yeah she likes yellow.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.217
- Just who are we picking
these for anyway?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.195
- Madison.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.198
- Your sister, how sweet of you.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.409
- Maybe she'll like me again.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.202
- Sammy Madison loves you.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.437
- But she doesn't like me.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.334
- She's never home anymore
unless you make her.

31:41.358 --> 31:45.279
- Being 11, a girl in
middle school isn't easy.

31:47.156 --> 31:51.409
- Neither is being nine,
a boy, and being stupid.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.388
- Sammy you are not stupid.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.164
- Madison says.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.852
- Yesterday on the phone.

31:58.876 --> 32:02.022
She was talking to
one of her friends.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.399
She said she couldn't
go to the movies

32:04.423 --> 32:08.653
because she has to baby
sit her stupid brother.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.740
- Sammy sometimes people say
things without thinking.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.742
She didn't mean that.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.518
Besides you watch
someday Madison

32:17.728 --> 32:19.771
is gonna see just
how smart you are.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.207
- But I'm not.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.940
- Yes you are very smart.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.111
- I know I'm smart
but I'm not a baby.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.615
- You will always be my baby.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.537
- So which one should
we pick next Sam?

32:43.462 --> 32:44.462
- Sam.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.633
It is Sam?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.405
- Yes, Sam.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.948
- Oh good.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.786
Thought I was gonna have to
address you by your shoe size.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.622
Are you just gonna stand
there or are you gonna help?

33:00.646 --> 33:02.457
- I don't know what to do.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.334
- Of course you don't.

33:04.358 --> 33:06.211
That's the trouble
with kids today.

33:06.235 --> 33:09.881
They don't how to do anything
but book their face and twit.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.990
Get over here, come here.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.075
Come on.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.538
Now put these on.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.666
They'll keep the
manure off your hands.

33:22.084 --> 33:24.002
- You know animal dung.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.003
Poop.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.693
Oh don't give me that look.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.361
It's perfectly natural.

33:31.385 --> 33:34.679
Look the plants need
nutrients in order to grow.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.325
And plants get nutrients
from what animals eat

33:37.349 --> 33:40.519
and that eventually
turns into manure.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.374
And without it plants don't grow

33:44.398 --> 33:46.734
and you my friend don't eat.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.257
Where did you think
produce comes from?

33:52.281 --> 33:53.949
- The grocery store.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.219
- The grocery store what a.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.679
What do they teach
you in school?

33:57.703 --> 33:58.912
- I worked there.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.766
- The grocery store back home.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.208
- Oh yeah, I see.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.547
Well now you know
where the groceries

34:09.547 --> 34:11.717
that you bagged came from.

34:14.678 --> 34:18.599
- Yeah and they also need
water so get to work.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.408
- It's good, thanks Roy.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.179
- It's well deserved.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.913
We had a very good
morning in the garden.

34:41.914 --> 34:45.518
- Sorry about cutting
the zucchini vine.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.896
- You had to bring
that up right?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.397
Don't worry about it.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.734
It could have been a weed
it's an honest mistake.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.592
- I make a lot of mistakes.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.824
The key is to learn from
them and then move on.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.517
- Everyone's so much

35:05.270 --> 35:06.270
smarter.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.942
- Oh Sam is that
what you believe?

35:11.485 --> 35:12.485
Oh no no.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.634
You like to watch
thunderstorms right?

35:17.658 --> 35:18.968
- I guess.

35:18.992 --> 35:21.346
- Now when a thunderstorm
is rolling in

35:21.370 --> 35:24.933
first you see a flash
of lightening.

35:24.957 --> 35:28.125
And then a few seconds later
you hear the boom right?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.604
- Right.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.982
- Well that's because light
moves faster than sound.

35:33.006 --> 35:36.133
You see it before you hear it.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.654
And the way I look
at it the same thing

35:37.678 --> 35:39.303
could be said about some people.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.807
I mean some people
may appear bright.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.537
Until they open
their mouths, boom.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.563
Then you know the truth.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.524
Your cone's dripping.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.990
- Come on pick up.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.658
Sam?

36:05.205 --> 36:07.392
Sam where are you?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.835
Just give me a call back now.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.508
- No and I said I would call.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.904
- No no I'm fine.

36:19.928 --> 36:22.407
He can take care of himself.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.683
I've got to get these done.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.125
What do you think of this one?

36:32.149 --> 36:33.150
No this way.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.531
- It's nice.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.303
It's not finished yet.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.537
- Frankly it's
missing something.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.516
What's it missing?

36:48.540 --> 36:51.269
- I think you not knowing
what's missing is the problem.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.062
- Joan I don't have
time for your riddles.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.064
- Madison ever
since I've met you

36:55.088 --> 36:56.547
what's impressed
me about your work

36:56.548 --> 36:59.319
is that when I look
at it I see you,

36:59.343 --> 37:01.470
your feelings, your heart.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.057
It's missing you.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.101
I'll get it.

37:16.902 --> 37:17.902
Feelings?

37:19.237 --> 37:20.489
Want to see me?

37:21.615 --> 37:24.701
You know want to know
what I'm thinking?

37:27.079 --> 37:29.057
I'll show you.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.124
You want to see my heart?

37:32.417 --> 37:33.752
There, finished.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.484
- Madison you have a visitor.

37:39.508 --> 37:42.028
- I can come back another time.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.054
- No it's okay, come in.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.182
- Call if you need me.

37:51.561 --> 37:54.106
- It's nice to see you again.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.879
- Oh yeah, I'm Pastor Jason
Bridges from church.

37:59.903 --> 38:00.903
- Oh right.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.449
Sorry I didn't recognize
you without the...

38:05.450 --> 38:07.178
- You mean without the uniform.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.806
- Something like that.

38:09.830 --> 38:10.807
Hi.

38:10.831 --> 38:11.831
- Hi.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.792
- Oh sorry.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.030
Let's have a seat.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.305
- Oh thank you.

38:32.853 --> 38:36.290
This has a dadaist
quality to it.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.594
You know a little
bit of futurism

38:37.618 --> 38:39.036
with the destruction there.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.029
- Oh I'm sorry.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.383
I just wanted to follow up on

38:45.407 --> 38:46.991
your visit to our
church on Sunday.

38:46.992 --> 38:47.992
- Oh right.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.207
Look I'm sorry that my
brother disrupted service

38:51.231 --> 38:53.516
but please know that
it won't happen again.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.185
- No, no actually I
want to apologize

38:56.209 --> 38:59.188
that we didn't make the service
easier for you and Sam.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.372
I didn't realize that he's...

39:01.824 --> 39:02.984
Is he a special needs person?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.008
- No, no.

39:05.177 --> 39:08.346
That he's a person
with special needs.

39:10.140 --> 39:11.682
Pastor James filled me in on

39:11.683 --> 39:13.851
all that's happened
to your family.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.688
I'm so sorry about your mother.

39:18.648 --> 39:22.819
- Look he, I, both of us just
want to be able to help.

39:24.780 --> 39:27.199
- That's nice but we're okay.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.785
Everything is good.

39:31.745 --> 39:32.745
- I see.

39:35.499 --> 39:39.353
I hope you'll consider coming
back to worship with us again.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.546
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.548
At least not right now.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.135
- Well it's an open invitation.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.308
- Pastor.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.246
Don't read too much
into the evidence

39:57.270 --> 39:59.898
left by moments of frustration.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.210
- I won't.

40:02.234 --> 40:04.378
And I hope you won't
read too much

40:04.402 --> 40:08.072
into the failed attempt
of a congregation to well

40:08.073 --> 40:12.303
welcome someone the way Jesus
would have welcomed them.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.412
Well thanks for
your time Madison.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.998
Have a blessed day.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.096
- So here's a list of
everything they took.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.449
They took my laptop.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.159
They cleared out our coolers.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.786
They took all of our cash.

40:36.810 --> 40:38.412
- It's the same M.O. that we had

40:38.436 --> 40:40.206
with Don's hardware
store last week.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.250
- Fort Barber just isn't
what it used to be.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.276
- Brittany Wells,
Channel Seven News.

40:47.571 --> 40:49.364
- Looks like another
gang related burglary.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.617
- Yeah it's the fifth
one in the last month.

40:54.244 --> 40:56.013
- No but I got to tell you.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.317
The chief is getting a whole lot

40:57.341 --> 40:59.142
of anxious about this going on.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.958
- Yeah I bet.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.294
- Excuse me son.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.064
You need to be on this
side of the tape.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.463
- Sam come away from there.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.133
- Pro Wind sport shoe.

41:09.426 --> 41:10.706
- This shoe print
it's a Pro Wind

41:10.730 --> 41:12.440
sport shoe men's size
eight and a half.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.478
- And this one is a Dash
high top men's size 11

41:15.502 --> 41:17.952
with a slash or a cut
running across the

41:17.976 --> 41:21.146
sole from the big toe
down the center.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.792
Like those shoes.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.960
- Let's get out of here.

41:25.984 --> 41:26.878
- You two stop.

41:26.902 --> 41:27.879
Grady those are suspects.

41:27.903 --> 41:30.631
711 my partner's
in foot pursuit.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.989
What's that cut through?

41:31.990 --> 41:33.992
Yeah I'm running over there now.

41:39.623 --> 41:41.851
- Excuse me, Brittany Wells
with channel seven news.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.895
May I ask you a few questions?

41:43.919 --> 41:45.313
- I'm Sam.

41:45.337 --> 41:47.023
Nice shoes.

41:47.047 --> 41:48.524
- Thanks.

41:48.548 --> 41:51.652
So Sam how do you feel about
solving the crime spree?

41:51.676 --> 41:52.820
- I'm hungry.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.596
- There's your scoop.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.018
Alright good.

42:01.311 --> 42:05.499
Hamburger number two for
our growing young man.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.501
Here you go Sam.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.325
You know it's been a long
time since I've seen

42:09.349 --> 42:12.048
this apartment look
this clean and neat.

42:12.072 --> 42:14.698
- I doubt Madison will
notice either way.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.011
- Yeah probably not.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.346
So how was that first burger?

42:18.370 --> 42:19.639
Was it to your liking?

42:19.663 --> 42:21.098
- Perfect.

42:21.122 --> 42:24.668
- Good 'cause I made the
second one exactly the same.

42:26.086 --> 42:29.881
So tell me Sam what is it
with your interest in shoes?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.094
- Shoes don't lie.

42:36.805 --> 42:40.451
- Boots, flip flops,
deck shoes, loafers,

42:40.475 --> 42:43.955
pumps, sandals,
sneakers, wing tips,

42:43.979 --> 42:47.166
steel toe, no toe, polished
or unpolished shoes,

42:47.190 --> 42:49.566
loose laces, no laces, Velcro,

42:49.567 --> 42:51.236
they all tell me what
a person's like.

42:53.446 --> 42:55.758
- I can tell where
a person's been.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.908
Sometimes where they're going,

42:57.909 --> 43:01.788
how old they are and what
they do for a living.

43:03.415 --> 43:06.560
- What do my shoes
tell you about me?

43:06.584 --> 43:07.752
- You step in poop a lot.

43:09.504 --> 43:12.257
- Well that's an understatement.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.862
- Job, oh no I'm retired.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.847
I did work for the
federal government.

43:19.806 --> 43:21.641
- Absolutely not.

43:23.893 --> 43:28.124
- No no nothing like,
well there was that...

43:28.148 --> 43:32.110
No no I worked for the United
States Postal Service.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.964
- The Postal Service.

43:34.988 --> 43:36.632
- You were a mail carrier.

43:36.656 --> 43:39.576
- Well not just a
mail carrier Sam.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.097
I have you know I
was the Postmaster

43:43.121 --> 43:46.892
right here in Fort
Barber for 32 years.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.668
- Cool I guess.

43:50.253 --> 43:54.299
Your right, postal service
is not what it used to be.

43:55.342 --> 43:57.403
You're too young to know but

43:57.427 --> 43:59.803
the postal service
used to be glamorous.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.240
- You're kidding.

44:01.264 --> 44:02.474
- No no really.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.579
Used to be in the old
days people would wait

44:06.603 --> 44:10.147
for the mail carrier to
come to their house.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.335
I mean when they saw the
mail carrier on their street

44:12.359 --> 44:16.488
their heart would race,
their pulse would speed up.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.276
You never knew what they might

44:22.300 --> 44:24.472
be delivering to your mailbox.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.831
I mean it could be a
hand written letter

44:27.832 --> 44:31.812
from a friend or relative
you haven't seen for years.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.839
You know people used
to write letters.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.153
Maybe it's a postcard
from someone

44:39.177 --> 44:42.263
visiting an exotic
or far away place.

44:43.681 --> 44:47.703
Maybe it's a Christmas catalog
from your favorite store.

44:47.727 --> 44:51.898
Or even a note from someone
expressing their undying love.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.839
Now nobody mails anything
of importance anymore.

44:58.863 --> 45:02.200
Just bills, and junk
mail and more bills.

45:03.660 --> 45:08.265
People are too busy texting,
and facing, and twitting.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.934
Say I'll tell you something.

45:09.958 --> 45:13.145
You know your shoes,
you know your shoes.

45:13.169 --> 45:16.941
I bet you can't do
this, name a town.

45:16.965 --> 45:20.611
Go ahead name a town,
any town anywhere.

45:20.635 --> 45:22.219
- Green Bay.

45:22.220 --> 45:26.224
- The zip code in Green
Bay, Wisconsin is 54313.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.037
That was too easy
give me a hard one.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.728
- Branson, Missouri.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.189
- Branson, 65615.

45:36.234 --> 45:37.795
Is that all you got, come on.

45:37.819 --> 45:38.879
- Yakima, Washington.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.406
- Oh good one Yakima is 98901.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.762
Not bad huh?

45:46.786 --> 45:49.140
I tell you I was
the MVZ in region

45:49.164 --> 45:51.374
five for eight straight years.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.270
- Most Valuable Zipper.

45:54.294 --> 45:55.712
Come on try to stump me.

46:05.388 --> 46:06.931
Sammy are you home?

46:15.106 --> 46:16.106
- Sam.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.002
Where's your phone?

46:18.026 --> 46:19.086
- In my room.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.546
- In your room.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.131
I've been trying to
call you all day.

46:22.155 --> 46:23.632
- I didn't want to lose it.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.844
- Sam I told you I was gonna
call you and check up on you.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.596
I've been worried sick.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.180
How do you expect me
to get my work done

46:30.204 --> 46:32.850
if I'm sitting there
worrying about you?

46:32.874 --> 46:35.144
For all I now you could
have been in Toledo now.

46:35.168 --> 46:37.128
- Toledo, 43601.

46:39.422 --> 46:41.692
- Oh nothing Madison.

46:41.716 --> 46:42.716
- Madison.

46:44.636 --> 46:45.738
- Alabama.

46:45.762 --> 46:46.762
- 35756.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.311
I'm sorry it was my fault.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.939
Sam was with me all day.

46:56.940 --> 46:59.567
- Nothing much just hung around.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.630
Just hung around huh?

47:02.654 --> 47:04.174
- Earlier today local
resident Sam Gray

47:04.198 --> 47:06.490
solved a crime spree by
identifying shoe prints

47:06.491 --> 47:08.177
belonging to local gang members.

47:08.201 --> 47:11.013
The crime took place
here late last night.

47:11.037 --> 47:13.516
- Hey Roy we made the news.

47:13.540 --> 47:15.380
This is Brittany Wells
reporting for channel...

47:15.404 --> 47:19.396
- So solving gang related crimes
now is just hanging around.

47:19.420 --> 47:23.508
- Well yes it is if
you're a shoeper hero.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.446
- Just keep up the jokes.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.240
- Sorry, listen why
don't you sit down?

47:29.264 --> 47:30.890
You want something to eat? - No.

47:32.308 --> 47:35.162
- Sam don't start with me.

47:35.186 --> 47:38.249
And Roy how 'bout the
next time the two of you

47:38.273 --> 47:40.023
decide to pair up
as the dynamic duo

47:40.024 --> 47:41.710
how 'bout you give me
the common courtesy

47:41.734 --> 47:44.194
of calling and letting
me know where Sam is.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.405
- I can take care of myself.

47:47.031 --> 47:50.177
Then how 'bout you prove it.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.536
I'm sorry about the trash can.

47:52.537 --> 47:54.473
I'll replace it okay.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.392
- That's fine Madison.

47:56.416 --> 47:57.417
- Goodnight.

48:00.295 --> 48:02.648
- What do Madison's shoes
tell you about her?

48:02.672 --> 48:05.025
- She's high maintenance.

48:05.049 --> 48:06.550
- Fair enough.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.551
Hey listen I think we had
enough fun for one night.

48:08.575 --> 48:09.385
I'll help you clean up.

48:09.409 --> 48:11.156
- I got it Roy.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.180
- Okay.

48:12.890 --> 48:13.909
Goodnight Sam.

48:13.933 --> 48:15.119

- Nope eight and a half.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.280
- Well I was close.

52:20.304 --> 52:21.471
- Not close enough.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.266
- Sam you are gonna
clean me out.

52:24.642 --> 52:25.642
- My phone.

52:27.812 --> 52:31.315
My sister wants to know if
we are behaving ourselves.

52:32.859 --> 52:37.047
- So much for bungee jumping
off the City Hall clock tower.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.006
Don't tell her that.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.030
- I'm not.

52:40.157 --> 52:42.010
- That we're spending an
afternoon in the park.

52:42.034 --> 52:42.845
- Good.

52:42.869 --> 52:43.720
Gambling.

52:43.744 --> 52:44.638
- Gambling.

52:44.662 --> 52:46.302
Rambling should do well
in the football...

52:46.326 --> 52:47.452
Don't tell her that.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.165
- Well we're not gambling we're

52:49.166 --> 52:50.877
doing research.

52:51.878 --> 52:53.921
- Yeah yeah tell her that.

52:55.006 --> 52:57.550
Now concentrate what about her?

53:03.264 --> 53:04.515
- A five.

53:05.869 --> 53:06.869
You're kidding.

53:06.893 --> 53:07.870
- No a five.

53:07.894 --> 53:10.479
- Wrongo, she is
definitely a 10.

53:12.899 --> 53:14.126
- No way.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.026
- Hey pal I don't
make the rules.

53:15.027 --> 53:16.027
- Excuse me.

53:17.361 --> 53:18.695
- No no Sam.

53:18.696 --> 53:19.696
Lady?

53:19.697 --> 53:20.697
- Yeah.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.535
- My friend thinks you're a 10.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.622
- I say you're a five.

53:29.582 --> 53:30.684
Where's your friend?

53:30.708 --> 53:32.019
- Oh he's right over...

53:32.043 --> 53:33.043
Roy?

53:34.378 --> 53:35.378
Wait.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.190
I can measure you.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.214
- Sam.

53:41.344 --> 53:43.196
- Sam get over here.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.157
What are you doing?

53:45.181 --> 53:47.141
You can't tell a
woman she's a five.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.290
- Let's get out of here.

53:53.314 --> 53:56.400
Wait you actually own
one of these things?

53:58.694 --> 54:01.280
- Nevermind, nevermind let's go.

54:02.573 --> 54:03.950
Roy look.

54:05.117 --> 54:07.804
- Sam I am done looking
for one day let's go.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.163
- But Roy.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.250
Oh a shoe drive.

54:15.878 --> 54:19.382
Sounds like a job for
Shoeperman, come on.

54:39.527 --> 54:40.879
- Sam.

54:40.903 --> 54:41.713
- Good morning.

54:41.737 --> 54:42.737
- No.

54:43.739 --> 54:45.550
- No I'm not taking
you to church.

54:45.574 --> 54:46.468
- But it's Sunday.

54:46.492 --> 54:47.844
- But nothing.

54:47.868 --> 54:49.596
You remember what
happened last Sunday?

54:49.620 --> 54:53.624
- I was a little awkward
in my new surroundings.

54:58.462 --> 54:59.672
- Awkward yeah.

55:01.424 --> 55:04.801
Well I for one don't need
awkward I need sleep.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.238
- But Roy said he would help.

55:06.262 --> 55:08.240
- Fine then have Roy
take you to church.

55:08.264 --> 55:10.024
- But Mom and I would
go together every week.

55:10.048 --> 55:13.968
- Well in case you haven't
noticed I'm not Mom.

55:14.603 --> 55:16.123
- I've noticed.

55:16.147 --> 55:18.982
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

55:18.983 --> 55:20.943
I can't fill her shoes.

55:59.607 --> 56:01.024
- She's not coming.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.276
- Oh okay then.

56:04.195 --> 56:07.864
Madison doesn't know we
won't give up does she?

56:07.865 --> 56:10.618
Come on we don't
want to be late.

56:12.661 --> 56:13.680
- Good morning Roy.

56:13.704 --> 56:14.598
- Morning Phil.

56:14.622 --> 56:16.224
You remember Sam here don't you?

56:16.248 --> 56:18.769
- Yes, good morning Sam.

56:18.793 --> 56:20.687
Say I saw your picture
in the paper.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.564
Nice job catching
those hoodlums.

56:22.588 --> 56:23.588
- Thanks.

56:24.507 --> 56:26.860
- Say Phil you don't mind if Sam

56:26.884 --> 56:29.071
hangs on to his backpack do you?

56:29.095 --> 56:30.553
- Oh no that'll be fine.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.556
- Great thanks, come on.

56:37.103 --> 56:40.064
Sam Sam why don't
we sit over here?

56:42.919 --> 56:43.919
- Good morning.

56:43.943 --> 56:44.943
- Morning.

56:48.239 --> 56:49.239
- Joe.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.083
- Yes.

57:00.709 --> 57:02.044
- No no not yet.

57:13.407 --> 57:14.407
- Good morning.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.266
Good morning.

57:16.267 --> 57:18.537
- We begin our worship
today in the name of

57:18.561 --> 57:23.273
the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, amen.

57:23.274 --> 57:28.154
Let us join in the singing of
our first hymn, number 221.

57:46.964 --> 57:49.276
You remember I made the
same reference last week

57:49.300 --> 57:51.903
so for those of you who
were awake last week

57:51.927 --> 57:54.781
you'll see how this
week fits in to that.

57:54.805 --> 57:55.824
And so my friends...

57:55.848 --> 57:57.016
- That's the cue.

57:58.267 --> 57:59.667
- Whenever he's
getting ready to end

57:59.691 --> 58:01.872
the sermon he says
and so my friends.

58:01.896 --> 58:04.708
- Created in Christ
Jesus to do good works

58:04.732 --> 58:08.319
which God prepared in
advance for us to do.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.381
Amen.

58:11.405 --> 58:12.405
- See.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.969
- No no no, hold on, hold on.

58:15.993 --> 58:18.329
- Congregation you may rise.

58:20.539 --> 58:23.768
Now we have just a
few announcements.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.104
The youth group
will meet for pizza

58:26.128 --> 58:29.149
and a movie on Friday evening
in the fellowship hall.

58:29.173 --> 58:31.776
And also the stewardship
committee meeting

58:31.800 --> 58:35.697
was changed from Tuesday
to Thursday at 7:00 p.m.

58:35.721 --> 58:36.656
Any other announcements?

58:36.680 --> 58:37.490
Now?

58:37.514 --> 58:38.325
- Now.

58:38.349 --> 58:40.285
- I have one Pastor!

58:40.309 --> 58:41.352
- It figures.

58:42.353 --> 58:43.353
- Yes Sam.

58:45.689 --> 58:49.085
- There is a shoe drive
being held in our town.

58:49.109 --> 58:51.421
Kind of like a shoe-a-thon.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.131
- There's a python
loose in our town?

58:53.155 --> 58:55.032
- I believe he said shoe-a-thon.

58:56.367 --> 58:58.011
- Nevermind.

58:58.035 --> 59:01.223
- Shoes are being
collected for the needy.

59:01.247 --> 59:03.808
If you have shoes that
are in good shape

59:03.832 --> 59:05.393
but you no longer use them

59:05.417 --> 59:08.355
please bring them to
me next Saturday.

59:08.379 --> 59:12.734
I will be at River Park
from noon until 8:00 p.m.

59:12.758 --> 59:13.985
Thank you.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.487
- Thanks Sam.

59:15.511 --> 59:16.886
I think that's a
great way for us

59:16.887 --> 59:19.431
to get involved
with the community.

59:21.100 --> 59:22.702

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:08.910
You love kickball.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.185
- No thank you.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.479
- I'm not very good.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:15.022
- They do.

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:17.775
- I see.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.464
- You matter very much.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:24.259

you're my mother.

because it's true.

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:29.764
Sammy God doesn't make mistakes.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:32.748
God made you just the way
you are for a reason.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:33.810
- No one sees me.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.437
- They will.

01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:37.063
What do we say?

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.481
Let your light shine...

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:41.818
- So that they may know
the hope that we have.

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.319
- That's right.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.738
It's almost dinner time.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.616
Are you getting hungry Sammy?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.701
Sammy?

01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:51.786
I said are you hungry?

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.603
- Hi Roy.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:53.437
- Hi Sam.

01:02:53.438 --> 01:02:54.938
Got you a hot dog.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.212
Hope you like mustard
and ketchup.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:02.404
- Sure thanks.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.927
I thank you God for
this food amen.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.951
- Amen.

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.080
So how's business?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.893
- Not so good.

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:16.936
But there's still three
hours left to go.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.796
I think everybody's just
waiting 'til the last minute.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.817
- Oh yeah probably.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:26.279
Pastor Bridges did bring over
a pair of his running shoes.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.180
- Ooh those are bright.

01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:32.285
Oh I see another pair
over there that's good.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.328
- Those are mine.

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:35.938
I was trying to prime the pump.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:39.459
- Smart entrepreneur.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.816
- Doesn't seem to be working.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.795
- Oh that reminds me.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.154
Here you go Sam.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.661
- These are great.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.832
Men's black dress shoe
size 11 and a half.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.189
- You wear a size nine,
these aren't yours.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:03.006
- No no their Tom's.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.341
- My brother.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.702
- I didn't know you
have a brother.

01:04:06.726 --> 01:04:07.726
- Had.

01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.013
You see Sam I haven't lived in

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:14.619
that big old house
all by myself.

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:19.188
That's the house where I
grew up with my brother Tom.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:23.836
And then when my mother
and father passed away

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.031
I inherited the house
complete, complete with Tom.

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:32.011
You see Tom was...

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:33.096
- Like me.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.539
- Yeah in many ways like you.

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:40.895
And he lived with
me in the house

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:44.941
until he died and that
was eight years ago.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:47.235
Since then it's just
been me rattling around

01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:49.612
in that big old house
so a few years ago

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:53.157
I decided to convert the
upstairs to an apartment

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.184
and a year ago your
sister moved in.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.895
Honestly Sam I don't
think I have had

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.232
a dent free trash can since.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.947
Oh no I never married.

01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:12.867
- Well.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.139
It wasn't 'cause
I didn't want to

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:19.225
or didn't have the opportunity.

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.084
I mean back in the
day I was one of.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:25.255
Fort Barber's most
eligible bachelors.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.192
Bobby Collins and me.

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:31.821
See Bobby had been the quarterback
of the football team.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:36.016
But what I lacked in brawn
I made up for in brains.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:42.040
I remember there was this one
time I tricked him out...

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:46.234
Anyway I just decided it would
be better if I didn't marry.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.243
- I didn't want
to have children.

01:05:56.828 --> 01:06:00.289
I was afraid that
if I had a child

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.626
he or she would be like Tom.

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.294
- Like me.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:06.295
- Yeah.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.133
- You're smart Roy.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.845
- Oh no Sam, Sam I am not smart.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:15.805
No,

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.016
far from smart.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.435
And you know why?

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.480
Sam I would have been
blessed beyond belief

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.317
to have had a child
just like you.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:30.987
- Thanks Roy.

01:06:32.948 --> 01:06:35.033
- No thank you my friend.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.660
Well.

01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:40.765
Why don't we head home?

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:45.019
- No I said I would be here until 8:00 p.m.
I should stay.

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.188
- Oh okay I'll wait with you.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.172
- No no I got this Roy.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:51.632
- Okay.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:53.634
Sure.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.614
Goodnight Sam.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.366
- Goodnight.

01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.390
Roy?

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:01.327
- Yeah Sam.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:05.021
- Thanks for the hot dog
and for Tom's shoes.

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:08.733
- Bye Tom.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.270
- Looks like we got a hero.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.374
We got us a real hero?

01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:31.398
Lucky us.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:33.752
Good thing you guys
got out in time

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.796
so we could congratulate him.

01:08:35.821 --> 01:08:38.758
- What do you got
in the box hero?

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.259
- Shoes.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.495
I've been collecting
them for the poor.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.225
Do you want to make
a contribution?

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.584
- Yeah we got something for you.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.127
- Yes.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.191
- Yeah well Sam you
know the way you.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:58.300
ID'd these guys from
their shoe prints wow.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.636
We were thinking that you
should have their shoes.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.805
- You shouldn't steal.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.934
- I know I know, it's
societies fault.

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:09.478
Wasn't I just saying that?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.706
- All the time.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.960
- I mean kids what are
you gonna do right?

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:16.587
I mean they're constantly
doing things they shouldn't.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:20.782
Like you for instance walking
around here alone after dark.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:24.365
- Or putting up signs all
over town telling everyone

01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:27.662
that you're gonna be in
that park collecting shoes.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.832
It's a shame.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:30.725
- I have to go.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.750
- Yeah.

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:33.419
You do.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:38.359
Sam that trick with the shoes
though that was impressive.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.652
We want to help you.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.279
We want to help you
identify us later so

01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:44.448
we're gonna leave you a
few more shoe prints

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:45.890
all over your body.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.001
Hit him go on.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.401
Get him, get him.

01:09:57.986 --> 01:09:59.529
Alright get him up.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:23.427
Lets go.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:33.789
Sammy?

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:34.813
- I'm here.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.360
Come here.

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.714
Sam.

01:11:01.383 --> 01:11:02.591
Sam.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.236
Sam can you hear me?

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.364
- Let's proceed to room four.

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:08.931
We'll be with you in one moment.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.252
- I'm sorry you
need to wait here.

01:11:10.276 --> 01:11:11.535
- I want to go with him.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.603
- We'll come get you as
soon as possible I promise.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.796
- Sam I'm sorry.

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:42.673
So sorry.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.479
How is he?

01:11:57.647 --> 01:12:00.209
- Doctor says he'll make it.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.984
Couple of bruised ribs.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.422
Knee is pretty messed up.

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:05.947
Slight concussion.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:10.636
They don't think there's
any internal bleeding but

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.039
he'll be here just a few
days just to be sure.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:23.548
- When we were kids Sam
needed a lot of attention.

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.474
- Our mom loved us both.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.871
She did the best she
could under some

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:39.355
really difficult circumstances.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.776
- But I had to...

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:48.197
Go with the flow?

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:49.908
Step aside?

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.368
- You could say that.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:54.496
- I rebelled.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.807
- Oh I see.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:00.042
- Not in the way that you think.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.877
I didn't do anything bad.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:05.215
In fact I tried to be
good, really good.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.055
- Everything, you name it.

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:15.433
My grades, art, sports, dance,

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.523
the student government,
ag club, drama.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.903
- Okay maybe not everything.

01:13:32.826 --> 01:13:35.679
Not that it seemed
to matter much.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:38.641
The grades, the
first place medals,

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:42.251
the applause, scholarships,
whatever it was.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:46.422
Oh that's nice Madison but did
you see what Sam did today?

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.425
Where Sam went today?

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.863
Oh Madison listen
to Sam tell you

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:56.099
the story about the
shoes he saw today.

01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:58.393
I hate shoes.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:02.540
One year I went barefoot
for an entire summer

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:06.734
just for the hope that Sam
wouldn't be able to recognize me.

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:12.591
- But eventually you had
to put your shoes back on.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:13.615
- Yeah.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.263
Made it easier to run though.

01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:19.348
- And enter Fort Barber.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.808
- And freedom.

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:22.893
Finally I had control.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:27.005
I made the choices, the
decisions right or wrong.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:28.965
I had a life.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:35.805
'Til one day I
answered the phone

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.474
and was sentenced
to being my mom.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:40.953
- Without the hope of parole.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:45.148
- I was gonna have to be her
for the rest of my life.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:15:01.473
On my way up here I caught
myself thinking that

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:04.584
maybe it would be
better if Sam died.

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:10.340
After all he'd be better
off in Heaven right?

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.469
- Well we all will be someday.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.179
- Someday.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.017
But not today.

01:15:23.228 --> 01:15:27.856
When I saw him I realized
how foolish I had been

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:31.611
to think that Sam was
God's curse on my life.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:37.885
Sam taught me that
it's not all about me.

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:40.161
- Well now that is freedom.

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:46.918
- Actually Sam has been
a blessing in my life.

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:52.382
- Yeah yeah I have to admit it.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.385
I've been feeling
blessed myself.

01:15:56.386 --> 01:16:00.241
And not just because
Sam is in my life.

01:16:00.265 --> 01:16:03.101
But because you are
there as well.

01:16:06.498 --> 01:16:07.498
- Yeah right.

01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:08.523
- It's true.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:10.793
Well except for the loss of

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:13.235
the occasional
garbage can or two.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:14.463
Or three.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:17.490
- Okay fine but I'm
very serious Madison.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.742
You have a brought a breath

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.538
of fresh air into
that old house.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.042
And it is one that I
would greatly miss.

01:16:30.242 --> 01:16:31.522
- This seems like a good time to

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:34.256
ask for an extension
on my lease.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.591
- Oh it could be.

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:39.637
- Let's not get carried away.

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:41.805
Yeah?

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:44.017
- Excuse me.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.707
I'm sorry sir but
visitors aren't allowed.

01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:50.624
- Oh okay.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.650
- It's okay he's family.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:55.653
- Very good then.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:04.287
All nurses to the
nurses station.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.417
- Thanks Roy.

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:13.439
- For what I didn't do anything.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:14.630
- You're here.

01:17:31.898 --> 01:17:35.252
- Maybe today wasn't
so bad after all.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.611
- Maybe not Sam.

01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:42.301
- Long enough to hear
you wished I was dead.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.136
- That's not what I said.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.160
- I know.

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:49.831
Besides there might
have been a few times

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:53.002
I wished the same
thing about you too.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.640
- It's right here Sam.

01:18:19.237 --> 01:18:23.365
- Scripture says love your
God with your whole heart,

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:28.180
soul, and mind and to love
your neighbor as yourself.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.933
Now it would be very
easy to go through life

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:33.602
if it was all about
our outward actions.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:36.730
But it's not just about
our actions only.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:39.650
It's about loving your neighbor

01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:42.027
and taking care of
their needs as much

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.470
as you take care of your own.

01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:47.223
Roy what's wrong?

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.954
- No no I'm sorry to disrupt
the service everybody.

01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:53.747
- That's quite alright.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.041
- No on second thought
you know I think

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.960
we've all kind of gotten used to

01:18:57.984 --> 01:19:00.129
having our services
disrupted especially over

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:04.716
the last couple of weeks by
a young fella named Sam.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.160
Let's carry on the tradition.

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:10.745
I'm late because I
was visiting Sam.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.748
He's in the hospital.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:18.921
- Got the snot beaten out of
him by some kids in an alley.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:23.193
He was in the park collecting
shoes for the needy.

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:27.239
Remember he told us
about that last week?

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.867
He didn't get a lot of
shoes but he did get

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:32.767
a lot more than
he bargained for.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.413
Hey look I'm not telling you any

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:37.606
of this to make you feel guilty.

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:40.586
I mean we all know
that God has done

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.713
and is doing more
for us than we ever

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:45.948
do for him or for any
of our neighbors.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.677
It's just that I
know that I for one

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.262
have fallen into the
trap of thinking

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:54.457
that if I sit in a pew in
church every week I'm good.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.587
And I realize that
coming to church alone

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.817
makes me a Christian
just about as much as

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:07.302
standing in the garage
makes me a car.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:11.325
Yeah Sam is a person with
special needs that's true.

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:14.328
And that might make
us uncomfortable.

01:20:14.352 --> 01:20:16.330
But I'll tell you I've
lived in this town

01:20:16.354 --> 01:20:17.794
and I've been a
member of this church

01:20:17.818 --> 01:20:21.168
for a long long time
and I can't think of

01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:25.714
a single person I've met who
didn't have a special need.

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:26.738
It's just

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:30.719
like a wise young man
once told me some of us

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:35.682
have our special needs on the
outside for everybody to see.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.668
Some of us bury them
deep in the inside.

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:43.273
I'm sorry I've said
too much forgive me.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:46.133
But I do want you
to pray for Sam.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:51.180
And pray for me too that because

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:57.996
the love that God has
shown me I can find ways

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.523
to share that love with others.

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:05.236
And I'll pray the
same for all of you.

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.990
- Amen.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.555
- Yes thank you.

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:36.725
Madison where's Roy?

01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:37.977
- I don't know.

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:41.897
I told him you were
being discharged at 10.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:44.817
- That he did.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:49.697
Don't worry Sam he's probably
just stuck in traffic.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:52.825
- Good point.

01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:55.804
- My backpack.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.330
- Oh, here you go.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:00.434
Think I'm just gonna
call real quick.

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:03.002
- Hi guys, it's a beautiful
day why don't we walk?

01:22:05.356 --> 01:22:06.356
I'll take over.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.049
- Take care now Sam.

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:12.345
- Wherever the trail leads us.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:15.240

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.326

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.685
Your friends got
together and decided

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.230
they'd like to make a
little contribution

01:25:33.254 --> 01:25:36.465
to your shoe-a-thon
if it's not too late.

01:26:41.906 --> 01:26:42.906

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.308
Amen.

collected 832 pairs of shoes?

- Madison I don't know how you
did it but you pulled it off.

01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:28.131
These really have...

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:29.049
- Heart.

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:30.074
- Yes heart.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.035
- Well I was inspired.

01:29:35.329 --> 01:29:36.765
- Strong.

01:29:36.789 --> 01:29:38.016
Do you know what he said to me

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.360
when he first saw
the photographs?

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.313
- No.

01:29:43.337 --> 01:29:45.940
He said you have opened the door

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:50.384
to help people see the
pictures inside my head.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.362
- Wine.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.387
- Thank you.

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:01.062
- Cheers.

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:08.213
- You know Madison
I don't think Sam

01:30:08.237 --> 01:30:10.590
is the only one who
could benefit from

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:13.218
taking a look inside themselves.

01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:14.427
- Joan...

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:15.931
- Do you remember
when I told you that

01:30:15.955 --> 01:30:19.334
I haven't seen talent
like yours since me?

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:21.375
- I remember.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:26.856
- We have a lot more in
common than just our talent.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.590
Let me help you okay.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.093
- Okay.

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:34.095
Thank you.

01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:35.805
Cheers.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.267
- Not yet Sam.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:40.644
I was waiting for my speech.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:43.063
- It's about your photographs.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:45.566
- They sold.

01:30:46.733 --> 01:30:48.276
- All of them.

01:30:48.277 --> 01:30:52.446
- Pastor Bridges who can't
keep a secret apparently.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.677
- Sorry I'm used to
sharing good news.

01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:58.179
- Will someone please
share it with me?

01:30:58.203 --> 01:31:00.682
- Anonymous buyer wants to
keep the collection together

01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:02.725
and has offered to buy them all.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:03.958
- You're kidding.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:07.105
- And he's paying full
price for each one.

01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:09.315
- Congratulations Madison.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:10.733
- Thank you.

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:13.467
- Madison I pray that
they make a difference

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.555
in peoples lives as
you have in mine.

01:31:17.723 --> 01:31:20.434
- You have in mine
Sam, thank you.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:26.105
- I'm hungry.

01:31:27.441 --> 01:31:30.420
- Come on Sam, let's go fill up.

01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:31.796
- Look.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.238
No no don't look.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.969
Neil Sterling, he has
a vacation home here,

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:39.660
but more importantly
he has galleries

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.830
in New York, Chicago, L.A.

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:46.835
Time to mingle and Madison
start making copies.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:49.254
- Okay Joan.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:53.151
How about a numbered
limited edition?

01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:54.986
- Great idea.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.846
- Neil it's so nice
that you came.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:05.686
- I wonder who bought them.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:09.190
- Well obviously somebody
with very good taste.

01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:10.551
- It means the world
that you came.

01:32:10.575 --> 01:32:12.026
- Of course.

01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:15.948
- I know you had to deal with
a less than ideal tenant.

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:20.220
You listened to Sam
when no one else would.

01:32:20.244 --> 01:32:21.971
Including me.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:25.266
- Madison I just did
what anybody would do.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.519
- You did what
everybody should do.

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:32.714
- Yeah well tell you the truth
I had an ulterior motive.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.720
- Yeah you see I thought
that if I was nice to you

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:43.809
maybe you would consider
going into business with me.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.997
- You see I've come
up with this design

01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:51.960
for a really mod and
trendy flower planter.

01:32:51.984 --> 01:32:54.402
But the problem is I can't
produce it all by myself.

01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:55.570
I need your help.

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:58.341
- Really, I made a prototype.

01:32:58.365 --> 01:32:59.175
You want to see it?

01:32:59.199 --> 01:32:59.968
It's right over here.

01:32:59.992 --> 01:33:00.909
- Sure.

01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:03.412
- Now keep an open mind but...

01:33:04.538 --> 01:33:06.724
Isn't that great?

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:10.186
I mean the vessel may
be imperfect but.

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:13.564
God's works are always perfect.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.149
- Well I'm pretty sure
I can provide you

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:18.426
with some more
imperfect vessels.

01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:22.264
- And I'm sure that God
will provide the rest.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:26.171
- Thanks for taking me to lunch.

01:33:26.195 --> 01:33:27.495
- My pleasure.

01:33:27.519 --> 01:33:29.719
I didn't know Fort Barber had
so many great restaurants.

01:33:29.743 --> 01:33:31.249
- Well see what
you've been missing?

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:35.295
Stick with me kid and we'll
hit them all, often.

01:33:35.319 --> 01:33:37.755
- Well in that case this
walk was a good idea.

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:38.864
I am stuffed.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.218
Thank you very much.

01:33:42.242 --> 01:33:44.595
I'm sure we'll see you again.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:45.619
See you.

01:34:03.847 --> 01:34:04.847
- Come on.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.308
- Oh hey guys come here.

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:08.328
Where have you been?

01:34:08.352 --> 01:34:09.704
I have big news.

01:34:09.728 --> 01:34:10.913
- We can see that.

01:34:10.937 --> 01:34:11.956
Open house?

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.166
- Yeah yeah.

01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:15.084
I realized it was
finally time for

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:17.920
this old place to
see a new purpose.

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:20.264
- You should have told us if
you're thinking about selling.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:23.259
I'm not selling.

01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:25.003
- Than what was with the
Real Estate people.

01:34:25.027 --> 01:34:26.827
- Oh no those weren't realtors.

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:28.330
They were from the agency.

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:30.164
- No.

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:31.833
- No don't jump to...

01:34:33.085 --> 01:34:34.485
- And you bring the
CIA and the FBI.

01:34:36.505 --> 01:34:38.965
- Oh this is what's going on.

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:42.445
I've decided I'm going
to open up a day center

01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:45.114
where people with special
needs could come

01:34:45.138 --> 01:34:46.908
and I was hoping
spend time with me

01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:50.244
and my now Program
Assistant Sam.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.853
And maybe take some
classes with my new

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.357
in house Art Director Madison.

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.528
So what do you guys think?

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.341
Come on kids I'm kind
of out on a limb here.

01:35:03.365 --> 01:35:04.258
What do you say?

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:06.094
I can't do it without you.

01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:07.053
- I'm in.

01:35:07.077 --> 01:35:09.704
- Oh great, alright that's one.

01:35:10.706 --> 01:35:11.706
- I'm in too.

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:13.625
Alright terrific.

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:18.630
- Yeah sure see two
shoes, T and S.

01:35:20.507 --> 01:35:22.008
As in Tom and Sam.

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:28.366
- Roy...

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:31.893
- Come on in the house I want
to show you two something.

01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:34.663
Now watch it's still
a little wet there.

01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:36.167
But this is where
we're gonna be doing

01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:38.444
the arts and crafts Madison.

01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:42.880
And then I thought I'd make
this into our game room.

01:35:42.904 --> 01:35:44.197
What do you think?

01:35:51.413 --> 01:35:52.849
- You bought them.

01:35:52.873 --> 01:35:55.935
- Well sure those pictures
need to stay at home.

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:58.587
