(car alarm chirps)

00:56.250 --> 00:58.241
(phone ringing)

01:01.260 --> 01:03.080
Hi. What's going on?

01:03.130 --> 01:04.085
I'm following Damian.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.483
Good. You found something?

01:05.530 --> 01:07.395
Not with the Gerraghty family.

01:07.430 --> 01:08.749
I don't think
he's still working for them.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.698
But?

01:09.730 --> 01:11.789
He just pulled up
outside Florrick-Agos.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.233
DIANE:
To their building?

01:14.270 --> 01:15.259
Yeah.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.631
What do you think,
he's jumping ship?

01:16.670 --> 01:18.228
I have no idea.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.579
Okay, keep vetting him.

01:20.610 --> 01:22.498
Call me when you find out more.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.772
New York is really
coming together.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.242
I'm glad.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.214
You know where
your boy Damian is?

01:30.250 --> 01:31.387
My boy?

01:31.420 --> 01:33.149
You mean our newest partner?

01:33.190 --> 01:34.748
He's at Florrick-Agos.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.257
Why?

01:36.290 --> 01:37.382
I've no idea.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.625
But I guess you don't, either.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.163
DAMIAN:
Hello.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.360
Okay.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.891
Thanks, I'll try later.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.305
Yes?

01:49.340 --> 01:51.706
We have a meeting.
Damian Boyle.

01:51.740 --> 01:52.707
No.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.276
I have a meeting with David Lee.

01:54.310 --> 01:56.175
Yeah, David wanted
me to take it.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.872
He said, um, he'd "rather
negotiate with the Devil."

01:58.910 --> 02:01.447
Me, I don't care who I
negotiate with, so...

02:01.480 --> 02:02.583
Do you have my check?

02:02.620 --> 02:03.587
I do.

02:03.620 --> 02:08.410
$150,000. Your capital
contribution refunded.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.754
Nice furniture.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.852
May I see the check?
Yeah.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.233
Right after you sign
the exit contract

02:19.270 --> 02:20.737
from Lockhart-Gardner.

02:20.770 --> 02:23.307
Okay.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.160
Thanks.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.575
My pleasure.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.372
So, you're the
Governor's wife, yeah?

02:32.420 --> 02:33.512
Yup.

02:33.550 --> 02:34.710
Your husband's
the fella that

02:34.750 --> 02:36.308
slept with
all those prostitutes?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.553
Yes.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.659
Hey, I'm all for forgiveness.

02:40.690 --> 02:43.784
You know, confession-- best
thing God ever invented.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.354
Actually, I was talking
to me ma last night...

02:45.390 --> 02:46.596
Do you want me to read this?

02:46.630 --> 02:48.689
Yeah. Sorry.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.789
(knocking)

02:52.370 --> 02:54.395
Here. Something to play with.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.401
(indistinct chatter)

03:00.580 --> 03:01.831
What's the problem?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.541
The holiday party.

03:03.580 --> 03:05.445
Ah.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.517
Mr. Hayden,
could you do me a favor?

03:08.550 --> 03:10.347
Just look this over.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.381
It's my exit deal
from Lockhart-Gardner.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.456
Just_ see if there are
any hidden land mines.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.912
Certainly.
Thank you.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.984
Wait, wait. Let's bring
Alicia into this.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.397
We have sent out 800
invitations for Friday night,

03:20.430 --> 03:22.227
and we've gotten
30 yeses back.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.226
For the holiday party? 30 yeses?

03:24.270 --> 03:26.465
Yeah, we're trying
to figure out what to do.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.398
We didn't want to
ask you this,

03:27.440 --> 03:29.533
but... we need you to
invite your husband.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.606
Oh, come on, guys, we can't
keep going back to that well.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.404
If the governor comes, there
will be a jump in the RSVPs.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.408
Maybe people are
just late RSVPing.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.406
Let's just wait
another day.
No, the problem is

03:38.450 --> 03:40.372
another firm decided
to throw a party that night.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.388
Lockhart-Gardner?
Yeah.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.910
They're still trying
to starve us.
Okay.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.918
I'll make a call, but I'm not
promising anything.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.611
Okay, thank you.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.878
Who's...
Matthew Ashbaugh?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.420
What?

03:51.460 --> 03:52.688
Who's Matthew Ashbaugh?

03:52.730 --> 03:54.493
A... a client. Why?

03:54.530 --> 03:56.998
Special pains are
being made to segregate

03:57.030 --> 03:58.691
your interests from his.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.967
(classical music playing)
You can't get rid of me, Alicia.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.705
I'm always here.

04:04.740 --> 04:05.968
He's dead.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.671
Are his cases dead?

04:07.710 --> 04:09.507
I don't know.
Uh, some might be.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.872
Well, this contract attempts to
exclude you from any benefits.

04:14.650 --> 04:16.845
WOMAN: Hello?
ALICIA: Hello, Mrs. Ashbaugh,

04:16.890 --> 04:20.314
this is Alicia Florrick--
I don't know if you remember me.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.009
I used to represent
your husband.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.654
Hello?

04:24.690 --> 04:25.759
What do you want?

04:25.790 --> 04:28.020
Uh, is this a bad time?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.152
What do you want?

04:29.200 --> 04:33.489
Um, well, there are some cases,
y-your husband's cases,

04:33.540 --> 04:36.304
still unresolved, and I've since
left Lockhart-Gardner,

04:36.340 --> 04:40.333
and I was wondering if they were
settled to your satisfaction.

04:41.910 --> 04:43.741
You're not getting his money.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.805
I'm n... I'm not...
Um, what do you mean?

04:45.850 --> 04:48.842
There already is a will, and
if you make a big deal of this,

04:48.880 --> 04:51.610
I swear I'll sue you
for everything you have.

04:51.650 --> 04:54.380
(line clicks)

05:02.060 --> 05:04.062
ASHBAUGH:
You're not getting
paid enough, Alicia.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.795
Tell your friend
Will that.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.559
My friend?
Will.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.534
Gardner.
I thought you meant my will.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.969
Your... what?

05:11.010 --> 05:14.434
My last will and testament.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.936
You're a bit slow
today, aren't you?

05:15.980 --> 05:17.902
Mm. I think it's the music.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.009
Can we please
turn it down a little?

05:20.050 --> 05:22.917
And give the NSA a respite? No.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.748
If it's driving you crazy, just
think what it's doing to them.

05:25.790 --> 05:26.950
CLARKE:
Did you find out?

05:28.860 --> 05:30.452
About Matthew Ashbaugh.

05:30.490 --> 05:32.424
Oh, uh, not yet.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.826
I think it might have
something to do with his estate.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.589
That makes sense.
SONDRA:
Mrs. Florrick,

05:36.630 --> 05:39.098
your husband's
on the line.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.530
Robyn.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.060
Do me a favor.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.465
You see that man over there?

05:45.510 --> 05:48.001
Ask him if you can
record the negotiations.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.474
Tell him that you made a mistake
and you were supposed to

05:50.510 --> 05:52.410
do it from the beginning
and I'm mad at you.

05:52.450 --> 05:53.678
Cool.

05:55.950 --> 05:58.009
Peter, hi.
Is everything all right?

05:58.050 --> 06:00.109
No. Why did you wait
till today to invite me

06:00.160 --> 06:01.582
to your party on Friday?

06:03.590 --> 06:05.387
ALICIA:
It's a mistake.

06:05.430 --> 06:08.627
We've had some arguments around
here about imposing on you.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.888
Who called you?

06:09.930 --> 06:10.919
Nobody called me.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.858
It was an e-mail invite.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.094
By the way, it wasn't
an imposition.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.563
Although I do have to go to
dinner with my mother on Friday.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.702
Oh, okay, Peter,

06:17.740 --> 06:18.707
it's fine.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.832
No, listen, I really want to go.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.474
Mind ifI bring Mother along?
I think she'd love it.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.104
Jackie?

06:25.150 --> 06:27.448
Yeah. Can you call her?

06:27.480 --> 06:28.617
She doesn't think you like her.

06:28.650 --> 06:29.685
(chuckles)

06:29.720 --> 06:31.585
(chuckles) Okay.

06:31.620 --> 06:35.078
Uh, I got to go.
I'll see you on Friday.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.588
You can't agree to a party
without seeing the guest list.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.881
Oh, yes, I can.
I just did.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.022
No, Alicia represents
some clients

06:40.060 --> 06:42.563
you do not want to
end up in a photo with.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.567
It'll look bad.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.124
Eli, you do what you do.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.139
Okay? But I'm going to
my wife's holiday party.

06:48.170 --> 06:49.603
DAMIAN:
So, are we...

06:49.640 --> 06:51.460
are we signing
this, or what?

06:51.510 --> 06:52.738
Just a few questions.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.738
IfI sign this,
I get my capital contribution?

06:55.780 --> 06:56.576
Yes.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.771
And this contract
will have no impact

06:58.810 --> 07:00.949
on any profit participation

07:00.980 --> 07:03.084
earned during my employment
at Lockhart-Gardner?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.088
Uh, this contract has nothing
to do with profit participation.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.212
So, it will have no impact...

07:06.250 --> 07:08.718
That would follow.
It would follow
that this contract

07:08.760 --> 07:12.594
will have no impact...
of any profit participation

07:12.630 --> 07:14.928
during my time at
Lockhart-Gardner.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.038
No.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.230
Nice try.

07:21.270 --> 07:22.498
That's yours,
this is mine.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.507
What's wrong?

07:23.540 --> 07:25.167
Nothing's wrong.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.905
Very nice talking
to you, Robyn...

07:26.940 --> 07:28.578
and Alicia. Bye-bye.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.941
(whistles
Angels We Have Heard on High)

07:34.750 --> 07:37.583
That might be all we need.
Play it back.

07:37.620 --> 07:38.689
What?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.551
I had it on SmackTalk.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.524
DAMIAN (high-pitched):
So, are we... are we signing
this, or what?

07:42.560 --> 07:43.527
ALICIA:
Just a few questions.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.893
IfI sign this, I get
my capital contribution?

07:46.930 --> 07:47.828
DAMIAN:
Yes.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.725
Uh, my nephews,
they were playing with it.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.896
ALICIA (high-pitched):
...will have no impact

07:50.930 --> 07:52.636
on any profit
participation earned...

07:56.570 --> 07:57.798
So it will have no impact?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.705
It does that when you
push the farting button.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.832
And you pushed

08:00.880 --> 08:02.802
the farting button?
Not on purpose.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.943
...profit participation
dunng”.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.675
Mrs. Florrick?
ALICIA:
Yes?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.245
This is... a_ bit
of a surprise.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.009
Uh, you haven't signed
the exit contract?

08:11.050 --> 08:13.052
No, not yet. Why?

08:13.090 --> 08:14.955
I called an old acquaintance
in probate court

08:14.990 --> 08:16.958
about Mr. Ashbaugh's estate.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.287
A contending will

08:18.330 --> 08:20.059
has been discovered.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.795
Okay.
There were
two beneficiaries.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.525
The Smile Train, a charity.
* Angels we have heard on high

08:23.570 --> 08:25.561
It's been bequeathed
$12 million.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.693
* Sweetly singing
And you have been bequeathed

08:27.740 --> 08:29.605
the rest. _
* O'er the plains

08:29.640 --> 08:30.937
How much is the rest?

08:30.970 --> 08:32.574
* And the mountains in reply

08:32.610 --> 08:33.838
$12 million.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.098
* Echoing their joyful strains

08:36.140 --> 08:37.573
Holy s...

08:37.610 --> 08:45.016
* Gloria

08:45.050 --> 08:49.851
* In excelsis Deo.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.189
* Joy to the world

09:00.240 --> 09:02.561
* The Lord_ is _come
(phone rIngIng)

09:02.610 --> 09:06.159
* Let Earth receive
her king... *

09:06.210 --> 09:07.700
Hello?

09:07.740 --> 09:10.300
(ringing continues)
* Let every heart

09:10.350 --> 09:13.171
* Prepare him room

09:13.220 --> 09:15.313
* And heaven and nature sing

09:15.350 --> 09:18.888
* And heaven
and nature snng... *

09:20.320 --> 09:21.184
Hello?

09:21.220 --> 09:25.020
(laughing):
Oh, hello, Alicia, hello.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.620
I-I'm sorry, I have a phone now.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.025
It's very confusing.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.220
How are the kids?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.022
Great.
Jackie, actually...

09:32.070 --> 09:33.765
I wanted to invite you
to a party.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.097
A party?

09:35.140 --> 09:36.095
Really?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.107
Yes.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.368
Um, this Friday.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.037
For my law firm;
it's a holiday party.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.035
Oh, well,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.741
I'm honored, Alicia,

09:42.780 --> 09:44.702
but Peter and I
have dinner plans.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.944
I invited Peter, too.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.242
I would love it
if you both could come.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.918
How wonderful!

09:48.950 --> 09:51.043
Thank you, Alicia.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.853
Holiday decorations,
Jackie.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.755
Not Christmas,
not Jesus.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.348
Holiday.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.654
I have a Hanukkah, too.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.090
DAMIAN:
So...

10:01.130 --> 10:02.791
you're following me.

10:02.830 --> 10:04.695
Yeah.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.293
Will was worried why
I was at Florrick-Agos.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.002
I explained to him that
I was there negotiating

10:10.040 --> 10:11.359
Alic_ia Florrick's
eXIt package.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.105
Good to know.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.232
Maybe I can help you.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.975
What do you
need to know?

10:16.010 --> 10:18.376
How involved you are
with your old clients.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.775
I'm not involved.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.709
They're criminals,
and I'm a lavwer.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.115
Of course.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.310
Thanks.

10:25.350 --> 10:26.385
Hmm.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.388
ELI: Check out
the highlighted name.
What's this?

10:31.430 --> 10:33.250
This is the guest list for
Alicia Florrick's party.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.324
The one Peter
IS attending.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.248
MARILYN:
"Colin Sweeney..."

10:36.300 --> 10:37.392
Who...?

10:37.430 --> 10:39.125
Oh...
Yes.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.296
The wife-killer.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.160
The white O.J.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.167
One of Alicia's clients.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.700
Well, you should
tell Peter.

10:44.740 --> 10:45.707
I did.

10:45.740 --> 10:46.707
He's still going.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.002
Oh, that's unfortunate.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.439
Marilyn, you need
to tell him

10:49.480 --> 10:50.902
it's an ethics issue.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.874
It's not an ethics issue,
it's a publicity issue.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.944
That's not my business.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.015
But it's your
business that...

10:56.050 --> 10:57.881
(classical music playing softly)

10:57.920 --> 10:59.080
What is that?

10:59.120 --> 11:01.281
It's a pregnancy
sound system.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.821
It soothes the baby.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.782
The baby has to listen
to that all day?

11:04.830 --> 11:06.457
Eli, there are
no ethical issues here.

11:06.490 --> 11:10.199
Wait. When Peter
was state's attorney,

11:10.230 --> 11:11.993
he offered Sweeney a deal--

11:12.030 --> 11:14.066
early release in return
for wearing a wire.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.807
That's an_ ethics
Violation.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.071
Okay, but it's too late
to change Peter's mind.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.305
Once he says "no,"
he doesn't reverse himself.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.877
Then what?
Alicia.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.743
DUNAWAY: Okay, this
seems to be a matter

11:27.780 --> 11:28.815
of two wills.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.841
WILL: Yes, Your Honor.
Our client, Lila Ashbaugh,

11:30.890 --> 11:33.051
is the true beneficiary
of her husband's estate...

11:33.090 --> 11:34.182
Not after a second will
was discovered

11:34.220 --> 11:35.357
in a safety deposit box,
Your Honor.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.153
A will, we believe,
is invalid,

11:37.190 --> 11:38.885
and we ask _
for emergency relief.

11:38.930 --> 11:40.227
CARY: This second will was
drawn up one year later,

11:40.260 --> 11:42.399
and 16 months
before Mr. Ashbaugh died.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.763
Yes, but it was drawn up
in Magic Marker.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.438
It could be drawn up in crayon.
It's still valid...

11:47.470 --> 11:48.494
Could have been, but it was
drawn up in Magic Marker...

11:48.540 --> 11:50.030
You should know that.
It's still valid, Mr. Gardner.

11:50.070 --> 11:50.968
Ladies, gentlemen, yes, I know.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.228
I know. Other judges
let their lawyers run

11:53.280 --> 11:55.874
free and wild,
but in my court,

11:55.910 --> 11:59.744
my probate court,
where I have been assigned,

11:59.780 --> 12:01.111
you will bridle yourselves.

12:01.150 --> 12:03.084
Now, one will bequeaths

12:03.120 --> 12:06.385
the $24 million in personal
property to Mrs. Ashbaugh.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.809
And the other will...
The later will.

12:08.860 --> 12:09.827
The other will,

12:09.860 --> 12:11.851
uh, bequeaths the assets

12:11.890 --> 12:14.791
to the Smile Train charity
and...

12:14.830 --> 12:17.469
Alicia Florrick.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.798
Well, hello, Ms. Florrick.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.932
Your Honor.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.232
It seems to be
your luclq day.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.259
The wife of
a governor

12:23.310 --> 12:25.733
and a $12 million inheritance.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.375
Well, it's an odd day anyway.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.947
Now, it seems to be our duty

12:31.980 --> 12:35.848
to decide which will is valid,
is that correct?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.416
Yes, Your Honor, and
to that end, we have a witness.

12:37.450 --> 12:39.850
Paula Gidfar.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.983
I was the witness
to Matty's will.

12:42.020 --> 12:42.987
DAMIAN:
Matty?

12:43.030 --> 12:45.225
As in Matthew Ashbaugh?

12:45.260 --> 12:46.386
Yes, Matthew.

12:46.430 --> 12:49.490
Hmm. And this is your signature

12:49.530 --> 12:51.418
on the will

12:51.470 --> 12:53.165
with a little happy face
over the "I"?

12:53.200 --> 12:54.360
Written in Magic Marker?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.867
Yes.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.265
It's all that we had.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.234
Um, just before Matthew left,
we couldn't find a pen.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.077
Do you work as a notary,
Miss Gidfar?

13:02.110 --> 13:03.304
(laughin '
Do I?g)l

13:03.350 --> 13:04.999
No.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.917
Are you in the legal
profession?
Uh-uh.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.417
The reason I ask is,
Mr. Ashbaugh seemed

13:09.450 --> 13:11.509
to trust you with the witnessing
of such an important document.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.984
CARY:
Your Honor, we would concede
that Miss Gidfar works

13:14.020 --> 13:15.487
in the sex trade
as an escort.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.454
Oh, no. He's ruined
my presentation.

13:17.490 --> 13:19.993
And we would also agree
that her profession

13:20.030 --> 13:21.224
doesn't matter,
because it's still...

13:21.260 --> 13:23.865
DAMIAN:
Blah, blah, blah.
Do you mind...?

13:23.900 --> 13:25.162
(loud, overlapping chatter)

13:25.200 --> 13:26.326
(gavelbangs)

13:29.500 --> 13:31.104
It's an associate of mine.
Really?

13:31.140 --> 13:32.937
What kind of associate?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.038
Why, are you jealous?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.308
Heart-stricken.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.171
Paula's a very
close associate,

13:37.210 --> 13:38.438
very talented.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.141
And she reviews
all your... contracts?

13:40.180 --> 13:42.319
DAMIAN:
And how much did Matty pay you

13:42.350 --> 13:44.113
for the night in question,
Miss Gidfar?

13:44.150 --> 13:45.219
GIDFAR:
$5,000.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.979
And what does $5,000 buy?

13:47.020 --> 13:48.317
Do we really need to go there,
Counselor?

13:48.360 --> 13:49.179
There is a point, Your Honor.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.552
Miss Gidfar?
$5,000?

13:51.590 --> 13:53.524
It buys you the 9:00 to 9:00--

13:53.560 --> 13:56.290
9:00 pm. to 9:00 a.m.,
anything you want.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.197
Anything meaning sexually,
but not just sexually?

13:59.230 --> 14:00.436
Yes. Uh,

14:00.470 --> 14:03.303
some men want to cry all night
and be held.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.467
Some want dinner dates,
some breakfast, you know.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.330
Matty

14:07.380 --> 14:09.132
wanted a signature.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.602
Well, that and an enema.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.606
Yes, thank you.
Your Honor,

14:12.650 --> 14:14.345
a paid witness
is an invalid witness,

14:14.380 --> 14:15.870
and Miss Gidfar
was obviously paid.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.887
For sex.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.342
No, no, for everything.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.608
She just said
$5,000 covers everything,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.924
including the witnessing
of this will.

14:22.960 --> 14:23.858
Ergo she was paid.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.426
Ergo-ergo this will is invalid.
Thank you.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.223
You cross.

14:27.260 --> 14:28.227
What?

14:28.260 --> 14:29.488
You handle the cross.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.225
Oh, uh...

14:31.270 --> 14:32.567
Counselors, anything,
or should we move on?

14:34.570 --> 14:35.537
Good, Counselor.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.504
We're ready for you.

14:44.410 --> 14:45.946
(breathes heavily)

14:52.190 --> 14:53.657
Counselor?

14:53.690 --> 14:57.228
Yes. I...

14:57.260 --> 15:01.424
This, uh, all-service contract
with Mr. Ashbaugh...

15:01.460 --> 15:03.269
Could you speak up, Counselor?

15:05.300 --> 15:07.439
(loudly):
This all-service contract...

15:07.470 --> 15:08.129
Too loud.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.001
(clears throat)

15:10.040 --> 15:13.271
CLARKE: Have you
usually contracted

15:13.310 --> 15:14.538
in this manner
with Mr. Ashbaugh?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.140
In what manner?
You mean, the all-nighter?

15:17.180 --> 15:17.999
Yes.

15:18.050 --> 15:18.448
Yes.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.606
Yes.

15:19.650 --> 15:22.517
Oh, good. "Yes."

15:22.550 --> 15:27.283
And have you witnessed other
contracts for Mr. Ashbaugh?

15:27.320 --> 15:29.083
Have I?

15:29.120 --> 15:30.678
Oh, a few, yes.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.551
I see.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.264
Uh, did you, uh, witness

15:38.300 --> 15:40.666
the Lockhart-Gardner
retainer agreement?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.691
Come on, Your Honor. This isn't
about our retainer agreement.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.162
This is about a will.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.302
Is that an objection?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.479
Yeah, it is. Objection.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.309
Uh, Counselor,

15:51.350 --> 15:52.578
do you have a counterargument?

15:52.610 --> 15:54.714
Yes, I do. I very much do,

15:54.750 --> 15:56.547
Your Honor.

15:56.580 --> 16:00.186
It is, uh,
an argument about...

16:00.220 --> 16:01.983
many things.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.227
(both whispering)

16:04.260 --> 16:07.525
Oh. Specifically,
if-if this will is invalid,

16:07.560 --> 16:09.596
then the identically witnessed

16:09.630 --> 16:11.723
Lockhart-Ga_rdner r_etainer
agreement is invalid, too.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.260
I think that's
probably true,

16:13.300 --> 16:15.734
but you're still left
with an invalid will.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.967
Anything further,
Counselor?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.649
Actually, Your Honor,
uh, just one brief thought.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.216
If you'll indulge me.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.444
I will.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.482
Miss... (chuckles)

16:33.520 --> 16:34.612
Sorry, I forgot your name.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.355
Gidfar.
Okay.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.085
You testified earlier

16:38.130 --> 16:41.224
that you... just before
Mr. Ashbaugh left,

16:41.260 --> 16:42.750
he had trouble finding a pen?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.267
Yes.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.325
And what time did he leave?

16:46.370 --> 16:49.089
9:30. He had to get to work.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.303
And he had contracted you
for a "9:00-to-9:00," you said?

16:52.340 --> 16:54.399
GIDFAR:
Yeah. $5,000.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.568
CLARKE: So your service to
him was over at 9:00 am?

16:58.710 --> 17:01.349
Oh, yes.
Oh, I see where you're going.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.779
What time did you witness
the contract?

17:02.820 --> 17:04.617
After 9:00.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.140
So you were not being paid

17:06.190 --> 17:08.078
under his all-service contract
at that p0int?

17:08.120 --> 17:09.087
That's right,

17:09.120 --> 17:10.121
I wasn't.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.526
And so I wasn't being paid
to witness his will.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.551
Thank you, ma'am.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.319
Oh. Uh, nothing further,
Your Honor.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.278
(engine starts)

17:34.320 --> 17:36.311
(car alarm chirps)

17:39.550 --> 17:42.212
(rock version of "Hark!
The Herald Angels Sing" playing)

17:42.260 --> 17:44.524
* Christ by highest
heaven adored *

17:44.560 --> 17:46.425
(tires screeching)

17:46.460 --> 17:49.156
* Christ the everlasting Lord

17:49.200 --> 17:52.465
* Late in time behold him come

17:52.500 --> 17:54.695
* Offspring of a virgin's womb

17:54.740 --> 17:58.403
* Veiled in flesh
the Godhead see *

17:58.440 --> 17:59.839
* Hail the incarnate deity

17:59.870 --> 18:02.509
(horns blaring)

18:02.540 --> 18:04.804
"f Pleased as man
With man to dwell *

18:04.850 --> 18:07.410
* Jesus, our Emmanuel

18:07.450 --> 18:09.839
* Hark! The herald angels sing

18:09.880 --> 18:14.283
* Glory to the newborn king.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.810
Hey.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.748
Hey.
Having fun?

18:17.790 --> 18:19.451
Ithought
you were gonna go fast.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.889
(chuckles)

18:20.930 --> 18:22.227
Want to try the highway?

18:22.260 --> 18:24.228
It's up to you.
I'm just your tail.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.760
When I lose you, just, you know,

18:25.800 --> 18:28.530
give me a call,
and I'll slow down, all right?

18:34.540 --> 18:37.407
(tires screeching)

18:37.450 --> 18:39.543
(phone ringing)

18:39.580 --> 18:41.548
DAMIAN: Kalinda, you need
to go out with me.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.615
Sure. When?

18:42.650 --> 18:44.618
No, I'm serious.
Just the two of us.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.481
Me mom loves the Indians.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.318
What makes you think I'm Indian?

18:49.360 --> 18:52.227
(laughs) Okay, the highway's
just ahead of you. Ready?

18:52.260 --> 18:54.251
(horns blaring)

18:55.760 --> 18:57.796
(siren wailing)

18:59.200 --> 19:00.792
Oh, Kalinda...

19:00.840 --> 19:04.367
you're driving too fast, love.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.777
(siren whoops, stops)

19:11.810 --> 19:14.517
Going a little fast there,
aren't you, Speed Racer?

19:14.550 --> 19:16.643
Detective, I'm a licensed
private investigator

19:16.680 --> 19:18.216
in pursuit of a suspect.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.683
Really? What suspect?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.509
Hi-ya, Jenna, how's it going?

19:22.560 --> 19:24.380
Damian, you were right,
she was following you.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.228
DAMIAN: Yeah. But don't
go too hard on her.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.227
She meant well.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.421
* Hail the incarnate deity...

19:31.600 --> 19:33.397
Ma'am, please step out
of the car.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.896
Come on.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.261
What? 90 miles in a 45 zone?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.663
It's reckless driving,

19:38.710 --> 19:40.905
aggravated fleeing
of a peace officer.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.408
It's a felony. Get out of
the car; you're under arrest.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.408
VERONICA: Hello, I'm here for
my daughter, Alicia Florrick.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.509
Hi. Uh, she's at court
right now,

19:48.550 --> 19:50.541
but she should be back
in about an hour.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.649
(phone ringing)
Oh. Excuse me.

19:54.820 --> 19:55.980
Hello.

19:56.020 --> 19:59.285
Oh, Veronica, how are you?

19:59.330 --> 20:00.627
It's Jackie.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.390
Oh, yes. Jackie.

20:03.430 --> 20:04.499
How are you?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.293
Oh, I'm very well, thank you.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.696
I'm at Peter_'s
governor's offices,

20:08.740 --> 20:10.833
and they're very impressive.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.338
I'm glad.
What do you need, Jackie?

20:13.380 --> 20:14.904
Well, I was just wondering

20:14.940 --> 20:17.306
when you'll be
at Alicia's party.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.569
I was hoping
to meet up with you there.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.945
You know, the holiday party
on Friday

20:24.990 --> 20:26.946
at Alicia's new firm.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.726
Veronica?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.455
DIANE: According to its date,
this will was

20:32.490 --> 20:35.254
drawn up 16 months prior
to your husband's death.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.449
Could you comment

20:36.500 --> 20:37.990
on your husband's
mental state at that time?

20:38.030 --> 20:39.725
Objection.
Improper expert opinion.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.465
Sustained.
DIANE:
Was your husband having

20:41.500 --> 20:43.263
difficulty at Baugh Tech,

20:43.310 --> 20:44.732
the company he formed?
He was.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.567
The New York board
was attempting

20:46.610 --> 20:48.271
to have him removed for cause.

20:48.310 --> 20:50.278
And what was that cause?

20:50.310 --> 20:51.971
Mental incapacity.

20:52.010 --> 20:54.012
My husband was
being deposed

20:54.050 --> 20:56.473
by the board
for acting erratically.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.408
ALICIA:
That's why we need

20:58.450 --> 21:00.452
to prep you
for your deposition tomorrow.

21:00.490 --> 21:01.889
It's power.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.525
What is power, sir?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.380
Insanity.

21:06.430 --> 21:09.627
So you're saying
your eccentricity is a put-on?

21:09.660 --> 21:11.764
Yes.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.564
Throwing off the equilibrium
of your opponent.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.831
I have a saying
over my desk:

21:17.870 --> 21:19.633
"Play the fox.
Play the fox."

16 months prior

Not back then, no.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.718
DIANE:
Nothing further, Your Honor.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.308
CLARKE:
Just a few questions.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.489
Mr. Hayden, one thing.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.980
What do they have?

21:35.020 --> 21:37.557
Something from the weekend
we were out there with Ashbaugh.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.922
CLARKE:
What did your husband have
written over his desk?

21:39.960 --> 21:41.951
What?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.924
Your husband had a motto written
over his desk. What did it say?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.198
What?

21:46.230 --> 21:49.529
Your husband had a motto written
over his desk. What did it say?

21:49.570 --> 21:50.798
ASHBAUGH:
It's power.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.829
So you're saying

21:51.870 --> 21:53.599
your eccentricity
is a put-on?
Yes.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.006
Throwing off your
opponent's equilibrium.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.543
I have a saying over my desk:

21:58.580 --> 22:00.002
LILA:
"Always play the fox.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.847
"They'll never know
you're the sanest man

22:01.880 --> 22:03.108
in the room."

22:03.150 --> 22:05.414
CLARKE: Did your husband
often pretend to be crazy

22:05.450 --> 22:06.678
to throw off his opponents?

22:06.720 --> 22:08.381
LILA:
Not back then, no.

22:08.420 --> 22:10.923
Not when he was writing up
this stupid will.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.518
CLARKE: And did your husband's
board of directors

22:12.560 --> 22:14.824
rule that your husband was

22:14.860 --> 22:16.396
of unsound mind?

22:16.430 --> 22:18.398
No.

22:18.430 --> 22:20.364
CLARKE: Nothing further,
Your Honor.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.891
DUNAWAY:
Okay, I am ready to rule.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.431
We lost.
Given that we have

22:25.470 --> 22:26.960
conflicting testimony regarding

22:27.010 --> 22:29.672
Mr. Ashbaugh's sanity...

22:29.710 --> 22:32.406
(classical music playing,
Dunaway's voice fades)

22:53.100 --> 22:54.533
...therefore I have no choice
but to consider

22:54.570 --> 22:56.162
both wills valid,
given the laws of Illinois...

22:56.200 --> 22:58.737
Your Honor, um...
before you rule,

22:58.770 --> 23:00.772
we have another witness
we'd like to call.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.108
I have ruled that Mr. Ashbaugh
was of sound mind.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.072
Yes, and we accept your ruling,

23:04.110 --> 23:07.978
but there is
the matter of undue influence.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.716
Undue influence
on the deceased?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.081
Yes, we contend

23:12.120 --> 23:13.553
he was encouraged
to draw up a new will

23:13.590 --> 23:14.557
by his lavwer, Alicia Florrick.

23:14.590 --> 23:17.423
Your Honor, this
is offensive.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.519
We ask for a leave of the court
to question Mrs. Florrick.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.096
You have already
ruled, Your Honor!

23:21.130 --> 23:22.552
DIANE: Your Honor, this is
for emergency relief.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.727
This is ridiculous...
It is Within our rights
to call another witness...

23:24.770 --> 23:26.192
DUNAWAY:
That's enough!
(gavelbangs)

23:26.230 --> 23:26.992
It's almost 5:00 now.

23:27.030 --> 23:29.737
We will take this up
tomorrow morning

23:29.770 --> 23:31.533
with your new witness.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.639
What does he got?

23:34.680 --> 23:36.898
A whole lot of anger.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.779
Mr. Gardner will argue
you seduced Mr. Ashbaugh.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.856
Yes.

23:48.890 --> 23:51.484
Are you ready for it?

23:51.530 --> 23:53.122
I will be.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.855
ROBYN: Oh, thank
God you're here.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.855
What now?

23:55.900 --> 23:57.151
We got some more RSVPs.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.224
Good. How many?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.760
835.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.564
I'm sorry, did you just say...?

24:03.610 --> 24:06.101
Yeah, 835 people said yes.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.472
We can't fit 835 people

24:08.510 --> 24:10.137
in our offices.
I know.

24:10.180 --> 24:11.875
ALICIA: You sent out
a press release about Peter?

24:11.910 --> 24:14.617
No, we-we sent out
an e-mail alert

24:14.650 --> 24:15.844
to our invitees,
that's all.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.586
Cary?

24:17.620 --> 24:20.180
When did we stop
acting together?

24:20.220 --> 24:21.209
We are acting together.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.784
As soon as I agree
to call Peter,

24:22.820 --> 24:24.583
you're sending him an e-mail.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.552
As soon as I...
The party's tomorrow night.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.558
Then come to me.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.668
What did I do to you?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.596
Did I hurt you in some way?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.039
Mom, what are you talking about?

24:37.070 --> 24:38.731
You invited Jackie?

24:38.770 --> 24:40.499
Not me, your own mother?

24:40.540 --> 24:42.770
Mom, it's not a real party.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.141
It's a business party.

24:44.180 --> 24:47.047
Jackie calls me out of the blue
and lords it over me.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.877
And I'm just standing there
like an idiot.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.114
"What party?"

24:50.150 --> 24:51.686
Alicia, do you
have a minute?

24:52.990 --> 24:54.617
Mom, it was an oversight.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.719
I meant to ask you
tonight to come.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.057
You were? You're sure?

24:58.090 --> 24:59.887
You're not just saying that?

24:59.930 --> 25:01.124
I am not just saying that.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.650
Would you come to the party

25:02.700 --> 25:03.860
tomorrow night?

25:03.900 --> 25:05.788
Can I bring someone?

25:05.830 --> 25:06.922
Sure.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.063
That would be great.
Oh, well!

25:09.100 --> 25:10.806
I know exactly what
I'm gonna wear.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.205
I bought it last week.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.674
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
get back to work now.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.177
MARILYN:
Alicia.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.234
(clears throat)

25:17.280 --> 25:19.043
We have a small issue.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.843
Of course.
Is it about the holiday party?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.677
Yes. How did you know?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.245
ELI: Alicia, we can't let
Peter be in the same room

25:25.290 --> 25:26.939
as Colin Sweeney.
It's not just

25:26.990 --> 25:28.548
that Mr. Sweeney has
an unseemly past.

25:28.590 --> 25:30.285
It's an ethical question.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.187
It might seem like a quid pro
quo for his plea bargain.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.788
(classical music
playing quietly)
ELI: What?

25:34.830 --> 25:35.990
Do you hear that?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.625
It's my pregnancy sound system.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.331
It soothes the baby.

25:41.370 --> 25:44.066
He doesn't like Chopin very
much, but he really, really...
Alicia,

25:44.110 --> 25:46.135
will you speak to Sweeney?

25:46.170 --> 25:47.831
No.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.869
You won't? Why not?

25:48.910 --> 25:51.071
Because I won't
disinvite a client.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.839
Alicia, this is
not a small issue.
I know.

25:52.880 --> 25:53.949
You should tell Peter.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.709
And my guess is
you already told Peter

25:55.750 --> 25:57.308
and he's coming aanay.

25:57.350 --> 26:00.217
But I'm not disinviting
a guest.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.650
(siren whoops)

26:06.960 --> 26:09.724
So, uh, what's the plan?

26:09.760 --> 26:10.966
(indistinct radio chatter)

26:11.000 --> 26:12.069
My plan?

26:12.100 --> 26:13.260
Reading.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.836
For how long?

26:14.870 --> 26:16.735
See that bus back there?

26:16.770 --> 26:19.204
Takes arrestees to court
for their bond hearings.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.379
And you're waiting
till it leaves?

26:21.410 --> 26:22.308
Yup.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.877
So I'm gonna be stuck
in holding overnight?

26:24.910 --> 26:26.844
Yup.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.177
Because Damian asked you to?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.619
Yup.

26:29.650 --> 26:30.719
Why?

26:30.750 --> 26:31.842
Because I owe him.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.084
What do you owe him?

26:34.790 --> 26:37.179
Wow. You can't turn it off,
can you?

26:37.220 --> 26:40.155
Just stop being an investigator
for, like, ten minutes.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.623
Will that help me?

26:41.660 --> 26:42.649
Sure.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.089
Okay.

26:45.130 --> 26:46.358
Charm me.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.958
What?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.161
You want out of your cuffs?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.633
Turn on the charm.

26:51.670 --> 26:52.807
I don't do charm.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.330
Okay, then sit tight.

26:57.210 --> 26:59.349
What do you call
a boomerang

26:59.380 --> 27:01.712
that doesn't come back?

27:01.750 --> 27:04.116
What?

27:04.150 --> 27:05.742
A stick.

27:29.410 --> 27:31.799
Mrs. Florrick,

27:31.850 --> 27:35.308
how long have you been
Mr. Ashbaugh's attorney?

27:35.350 --> 27:36.908
Around two years.

27:36.950 --> 27:38.247
Right up until his death.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.957
And in all that time,

27:42.990 --> 27:46.357
did Mr. Ashbaugh ever threaten
to fire you as his attorney?

27:46.390 --> 27:47.721
No, not to my knowledge.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.250
Really?

27:49.300 --> 27:50.892
Are you certain of that?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.898
Well...

27:52.930 --> 27:54.898
I'm not certain of anything.

27:54.940 --> 27:57.090
(chuckles)

27:57.140 --> 27:59.904
But if Mr. Gardner has
something more specific

27:59.940 --> 28:02.738
he'd like to ask.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.840
And in all that time,

28:10.890 --> 28:14.109
did Mr. Ashbaugh ever threaten
to fire you as his attorney?

28:14.160 --> 28:17.755
No, I mean...

28:17.790 --> 28:21.396
are you talking about the thing
two years ago?

28:21.430 --> 28:23.990
Yes, the "thing"
two years ago.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.292
Tell me about this...

28:26.770 --> 28:29.034
(grunts)

28:29.070 --> 28:31.061
Hmm.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.407
Did Mr. Ashbaugh express worries
about your representation

28:39.450 --> 28:41.418
in a meeting
in his New York apartment

28:41.450 --> 28:44.089
on September 23, 2011?

28:46.190 --> 28:48.055
They're out to get me.
Matthew, if you say that

28:48.090 --> 28:49.409
in this deposition,
it will sound crazy.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.052
If I don't say
in this deposition,

28:51.090 --> 28:52.318
then they'll get away with it.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.327
I have enemies.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.294
Yes, and your enemies will cheer
if you say this.

28:55.330 --> 28:57.025
Trust me, Matthew, please.

28:57.060 --> 28:58.493
Stop saying my name like that.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.418
I'm not 12 years old.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.893
Yes, sir, I...

29:02.940 --> 29:04.362
Matthew.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.900
Listen to me.

29:05.940 --> 29:09.432
You're a smart _man _
whose words are ea5ily tmsted.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.947
People don't see
as deeply as you do.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.208
And they'll use
the surface of your words...

29:12.250 --> 29:13.444
Stop it, Alicia.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.812
Are you married or aren't you?

29:17.350 --> 29:19.284
Are you married, Alicia?

29:25.990 --> 29:28.925
And after he asked you that,
did he threaten to fire you?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.928
Yes.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.426
And why did he threaten that?

29:32.470 --> 29:34.131
I don't know.

29:34.170 --> 29:35.797
But later that night,
didn't you say

29:35.840 --> 29:37.364
that Mr. Ashbaugh was
in love with you?

29:43.040 --> 29:45.873
Do you want me to
repeat the question?

29:45.910 --> 29:47.912
No.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.949
I was joking when I said that.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.083
You were joking
that Mr. Ashbaugh was

29:55.120 --> 29:57.213
in love with you and would
do anything you asked?

29:57.260 --> 29:59.251
You're saying that was a joke?

30:02.930 --> 30:04.591
Don't worry, I can get him
to change his mind.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.825
How?

30:06.870 --> 30:08.428
He cares about me.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.904
You've got him wrapped around
your finger, is that it?

30:10.940 --> 30:12.965
(laughs)

30:13.010 --> 30:15.001
I have my ways.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.289
*

30:48.610 --> 30:51.374
_ _ WILL: _
This is crazy romantic.

30:51.410 --> 30:54.311
(laughs)

30:54.350 --> 30:57.410
(church bell tolling
in distance)

30:57.450 --> 31:00.112
This is the happiest
I've ever been.

31:07.260 --> 31:10.229
Mrs. Florrick, you knew he was
in love with you,

31:10.260 --> 31:13.263
and you used it to get your way?

31:17.600 --> 31:20.501
May I remind you
that you are under oath?

31:21.510 --> 31:24.308
I didn't intentionally use him.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.944
Not intentionally?
I see.

31:26.980 --> 31:29.039
So it's just the way
you are with men?

31:30.220 --> 31:33.986
No.

31:34.020 --> 31:35.419
I cared for him.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.552
I liked him.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.457
And so it was all right
to use him?

31:39.490 --> 31:42.220
You make things sound so simple.

31:45.330 --> 31:46.558
I'm married.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.431
You always use that, don't you?

31:48.470 --> 31:50.495
"Married."

31:50.540 --> 31:52.235
You're conveniently married
when you want to be.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.670
That's not fair.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.439
I loved you.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.277
You made me believe that

31:58.310 --> 32:00.175
so that you could steal
my clients.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.212
No.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.616
Will.

32:06.220 --> 32:07.710
Stop it!

32:07.750 --> 32:09.650
I don't like it
when you're weak.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.429
Come back to bed.

32:23.470 --> 32:24.960
You're working too hard.

32:25.010 --> 32:28.639
And I have
a tough Witness tomorrow.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.739
Let it go.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.749
I'm here now.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.975
(chuckles)

32:43.790 --> 32:45.121
Good news.
Donna Bra2ile wants to meet.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.151
Why?
Why do you think?

32:47.190 --> 32:48.327
2016.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.452
(chuckles) No.
Yes.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.367
Peter, it's not just the
presidency they're looking for.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.628
It's the vice presidency.

32:53.670 --> 32:54.989
Biden won't be Hillary's.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.393
Hillary won't be Biden's.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.759
They're looking for new talent.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.506
Or a stalking horse.
So? The horse goes lame.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.508
The stalking horse
becomes the horse.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.576
Who's the horse?
I don't know,
Whatever you meant.

33:03.610 --> 33:04.599
The point is,
she wants to meet.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.742
Great. When?

33:05.780 --> 33:07.008
That's the problem.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.642
She's in town
this Friday.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.045
During Alicia's party.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.616
Eli, you know
that I want...
I know.

33:11.650 --> 33:12.617
I know.
But she'll understand.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.742
Alicia will understand.

33:13.790 --> 33:16.350
This is about
your future, Peter.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.699
You're not trying to pull
something over on me, are you?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.525
Yes, I'm arranging
a meeting with Donna Brazile

33:25.570 --> 33:27.390
to keep you from going
to Alicia's party.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.738
That makes sense.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.738
(laughs)
(sighs)

33:30.770 --> 33:33.238
You want me to call
AllCla and cancel?

33:33.270 --> 33:35.579
No, I'll do it.

33:39.510 --> 33:42.149
TV ANNOUNCER:
...and the fans are on fire,

33:42.180 --> 33:43.613
because they've
just witnessed history.

33:43.650 --> 33:45.641
(laughs)

33:48.660 --> 33:50.252
Used to be
a beat cop?

33:50.290 --> 33:51.826
Uh, yeah.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.225
For five years.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.797
Still got the
holster scars?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.127
Both hips.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.764
You like your Bersa?

33:59.730 --> 34:00.822
My BP9?

34:00.870 --> 34:02.428
Yeah.

34:02.470 --> 34:03.437
It's light.

34:03.470 --> 34:05.461
It's like a kid's toy.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.308
You should try
the Smith & Wesson M&P.

34:09.340 --> 34:10.432
Same size.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.698
Mmm, I never liked the grip.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.479
(TV announcer
continues indistinctly)

34:16.220 --> 34:19.439
You want to find out
about Damian, don't you?

34:19.490 --> 34:20.616
That's why you're here.

34:23.290 --> 34:24.518
Yeah.

34:31.730 --> 34:34.767
It's too bad I like Damian
more than I like you.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.064
Well, wait till you
get to know me better.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.849
* Silent night

34:45.880 --> 34:46.972
No, no.

34:47.010 --> 34:49.740
Alicia, I'm very excited
to come to your holiday party.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.611
ALICIA:
Jackie, I'm heading
into court right now.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.811
What can I help you with?

34:53.850 --> 34:55.386
Well, I was talking
to your mother,

34:55.420 --> 34:57.615
and she said she was
bringing a guest,

34:57.660 --> 35:00.686
and I would love
to bring a friend.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.493
Let me take it.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.521
No, I'm-I'm good.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.342
Good morning, Mrs. Florrick.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.268
Good morning to you.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.414
How long have you been
Mr. Ashbaugh's attorney?

35:25.450 --> 35:27.884
Oh, about two years.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.911
And did Mr. Ashbaugh ever
threaten to fire you

35:29.960 --> 35:31.780
as his attorney
over those two years?

35:31.830 --> 35:33.149
Yes.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.455
And when was this?

35:36.500 --> 35:39.219
September 23, 2011.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.895
Could you explain
the circumstances?

35:41.940 --> 35:42.895
Yes.

35:42.940 --> 35:46.432
You and I were at his apartment
in New York City

35:46.470 --> 35:48.529
prepping him for his testimony.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.172
And was there anything
about that night...

35:50.210 --> 35:51.199
Actually,
I wasn't finished.

35:52.310 --> 35:53.743
Do you want me to finish?

35:55.580 --> 35:56.547
Please.

35:56.580 --> 35:57.717
ALICIA:
He was being removed

35:57.750 --> 35:59.183
from the board of

35:59.220 --> 36:00.949
one of the companies
he had created.

36:00.990 --> 36:04.323
Mr. Ashbaugh thought that
he should be allowed to testify

36:04.360 --> 36:07.420
to some of the concerns
he had over the board members.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.657
We argued that was not
essential to the facts.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.395
And did you
change his mind?

36:13.430 --> 36:14.863
Yes, I did.

36:27.610 --> 36:30.738
And did you claim that Mr.
Ashbaugh was in love with you?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.482
Mrs. Florrick?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.722
I did claim that.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.761
And did you suggest that you...

36:49.440 --> 36:51.704
...could use his love to...

36:54.910 --> 36:56.377
...manipulate him?

36:59.710 --> 37:01.610
I said it was a possibility.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.015
And did you
manipulate him

37:03.050 --> 37:05.518
into signing off on his will?

37:07.550 --> 37:08.482
Yes.
CARY:
Your Honor.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.954
May I have a minute
to consult with my client?

37:10.990 --> 37:11.957
No, Counselor.

37:11.990 --> 37:13.719
I think she's doing fine.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.749
Conﬁnue.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.629
WILL:
And this manipulation,

37:18.670 --> 37:21.389
in your opinion, did it
constitute undue influence?

37:21.440 --> 37:23.897
Unfortunately, I think it did.

37:23.940 --> 37:25.999
WILL:
And was there
anyone else

37:26.040 --> 37:27.803
involved with this
manipulation?

37:27.840 --> 37:28.829
ALICIA:
Yes.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.939
There was?

37:30.980 --> 37:31.969
VVho?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.638
David Lee.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.719
David Lee was involved
with this will?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.648
No.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.521
The other one.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.057
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.522
Whoa, wait a minute.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.060
I don't think
Mrs. Florrick was finished.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.590
No, I don't think
she was, either.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.790
What-What do you mean
by "the other one"?

37:57.840 --> 37:59.398
Do you mean
the other will?

37:59.440 --> 38:00.862
Yes.
David Lee is

38:00.910 --> 38:03.037
Lockhart-Gardner's lawyer
in family law.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.379
He asked me to use my influence

38:06.410 --> 38:09.675
with Mr. Ashbaugh
to get him to sign this will.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.609
DUNAWAY:
You mean the will
benefitting Mrs. Ashbaugh.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.617
ALICIA:
Yes.

38:13.650 --> 38:15.618
Mr. Ashbaugh
was delaying.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.049
Mr. Lee asked me to...

38:18.090 --> 38:21.651
"prime the pump,"
I believe were his words.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.429
DUNAWAY:
Okay.

38:23.460 --> 38:26.759
Anything further,
Counselor?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.033
Not for the moment.

38:39.910 --> 38:43.346
You know, Eli thinks
that this is about 2016.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.608
Is he right?

38:44.650 --> 38:46.845
Well, he's partially right.

38:46.890 --> 38:48.687
We're gonna see
Who's suiting up

38:48.720 --> 38:49.914
and Who's sitting
on the sidelines.

38:49.960 --> 38:50.813
ELI:
Well, we're...

38:50.860 --> 38:54.079
W-Would you like us
to be suiting up?

38:54.130 --> 38:55.097
BRAZILE:
Well, it depends.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.722
Would you consider?

38:56.760 --> 38:58.022
(phone ringing)
Oh.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.027
Excuse me.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.799
Go ahead,
take it.

39:00.830 --> 39:01.990
Um...

39:02.040 --> 39:02.995
it's my mom.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.600
Well, now you
have to take it.

39:05.640 --> 39:06.868
No. No, he really doesn't.
Come on.

39:06.910 --> 39:08.537
It's his mom, Eli.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.535
Thanks, Donna.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.729
Hi, Mom.

39:10.780 --> 39:13.840
Uh... no, I'm sorry,
I can't make it.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.017
I'm in a meeting.

39:15.050 --> 39:16.938
Sorry.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.379
Yeah.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.682
All right.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.687
Good-bye.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.017
Do you have
to be someplace?

39:22.060 --> 39:23.152
No. No, we're just...

39:23.190 --> 39:24.157
PETER:
Actually, yes.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.782
My Wife's party.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.422
But I've occupied your time.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.794
Donna...

39:32.830 --> 39:34.832
do you want to go
to a party?

39:36.540 --> 39:38.565
Those are
magical words.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.532
(Peter and Donna laughing)

39:40.570 --> 39:42.071
* Jingle bells, jingle bells

39:42.110 --> 39:43.509
* Jingle all the way...

39:43.540 --> 39:45.770
ALICIA:
I can't hear you. Hello?

39:45.810 --> 39:46.970
ELI:
Yes, Alicia.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.773
Alicia, we're...
we're coming now.

39:48.820 --> 39:49.946
To your party.

39:49.980 --> 39:50.742
Eli?

39:50.780 --> 39:53.089
Yes. We are coming
to your party.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.815
Peter and... Donna Brazile.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.111
Did... did you just say

39:56.160 --> 39:57.980
Donna Brazile is coming
to my party?

39:58.020 --> 39:59.055
Yes. Yes, I know.

39:59.090 --> 40:00.227
We have lost
all shreds of sanity.

40:00.260 --> 40:02.558
(conversing indistinctly)
But I just wanted to know...

40:02.600 --> 40:05.125
please, God...
is Colin Sweeney there?

40:05.170 --> 40:06.865
Be of good cheer, Eli.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.197
Colin Sweeney couldn't make it.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.959
His flight got delayed
in San Francisco.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.900
Oh, thank God!

40:11.940 --> 40:14.602
Thank your Christian Jesus God.

40:14.640 --> 40:15.709
Merry Christmas, Eli.

40:15.740 --> 40:16.968
* Jingle bells...

40:17.010 --> 40:18.477
So, are we
millionaires yet?

40:18.510 --> 40:20.205
Only in the love
we have for each other.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.945
Can we buy anything
with that?

40:21.980 --> 40:23.675
Well, you can always...

40:23.720 --> 40:24.687
Uh-oh.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.938
What?

40:26.990 --> 40:28.082
Eli's not gonna
be happy.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.088
GRACE:
Why? Who is it?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.451
ALICIA:
An old client.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.151
Lemond Bishop.

40:33.190 --> 40:35.454
The top drug dealer in Chicago.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.899
Sometimes I think
of you as Mom,

40:38.930 --> 40:40.591
and other times just as
this interesting person

40:40.630 --> 40:41.699
who lives at our house.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.731
Be right back.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.067
Excuse me.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.099
Cary!

40:46.140 --> 40:47.630
What's Lemond Bishop
doing here?

40:47.670 --> 40:49.638
Oh, he came?
That's great. Where?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.977
You invited him?
ROBYN:
No, I did.

40:51.010 --> 40:53.444
I thought you wanted
him as a client.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.171
Oh, God.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.642
Because we don't
actually have

40:57.680 --> 40:59.739
a national religion
in America, Jackie.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.884
That should have no impact
on office decorations.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.922
Out of sensitivity.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.552
Veronica, I don't want
to offend you, but

41:06.590 --> 41:08.558
you really should think
about drinking less.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.692
Oh, really? Why is that?

41:09.730 --> 41:10.958
'Cause you're
raising your voice.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.262
Well, maybe you should
drink a little more,

41:12.300 --> 41:14.029
and that might kill
that bug up your ass.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.061
Could you deal with that?

41:16.100 --> 41:17.067
Thanks.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.465
(phone ringing)

41:20.770 --> 41:22.237
Florrick-Agos & Associates.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.579
Oh. I expected to get Cary.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.877
I'll have him call you back.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.148
No, that's all right.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.784
Uh, there's been a...

41:31.820 --> 41:33.811
Something's happened.

41:33.850 --> 41:36.683
We discovered another
safety-deposit box

41:36.720 --> 41:38.085
belonging to Mr. Ashbaugh.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.157
Okay.

41:41.190 --> 41:43.021
There were four
more Wills in it,

41:43.060 --> 41:45.824
leaving all his money
to four other women.

41:45.870 --> 41:49.658
This seems to be something
Ashbaugh does.

41:49.700 --> 41:50.689
Did.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.671
So it looks like all five
will be found invalid.

41:59.710 --> 42:02.645
Anything else?

42:04.280 --> 42:05.281
No.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.653
Well, thanks for calling.

42:08.690 --> 42:11.284
You're welcome.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.651
Happy holidays.

42:14.360 --> 42:20.196
* In a one-horse open sleigh.

42:20.230 --> 42:22.960
(guests applauding)

42:24.240 --> 42:25.730
I usually vote
Republican,

42:25.770 --> 42:27.761
but I couldn't resist
voting for you.

42:27.810 --> 42:30.074
Yeah, uh, here,
let's find Alicia. Donna...

42:30.110 --> 42:31.668
I-I would love some time
to talk to you, sir.

42:31.710 --> 42:32.779
About some
charity ideas.

42:32.810 --> 42:33.947
Sounds good.

42:33.980 --> 42:35.675
Hey, Cary,
congratulations.

42:35.720 --> 42:36.812
Is that who
I think it was?

42:36.850 --> 42:37.976
Yeah, just keep moving.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.817
Donna, I'd like you
to meet Alicia.

42:39.850 --> 42:40.942
Lemond friggin' Bishop?

42:40.990 --> 42:42.651
It was news
to me, too, Eli.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.351
PETER:
Hey.

42:44.390 --> 42:45.254
This is terrific.

42:45.290 --> 42:47.349
Thank you for coming.

42:47.390 --> 42:48.857
Donna, I'd like you
to meet my Wife Alicia.

42:48.900 --> 42:49.798
Pleasure to meet you.

42:49.830 --> 42:51.866
Likewise.
Thank you so much for coming.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.959
Something strong.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.106
Is that music coming
from your stomach?

42:59.140 --> 43:00.232
Yes.

43:00.270 --> 43:00.964
It's my music system
for the baby.

43:01.010 --> 43:02.637
Oh, how clever.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.977
How many months?

43:04.010 --> 43:05.079
MARILYN:
Three and a half.

43:05.110 --> 43:06.702
VERONICA: And do you
know the sex yet?

43:06.750 --> 43:07.899
MARILYN:
I do. It's a boy.

43:07.950 --> 43:09.679
Oh, a boy.

43:09.720 --> 43:10.778
How sweet.

43:10.820 --> 43:11.787
I love boys.

43:11.820 --> 43:13.219
Do you have a name yet?

43:13.250 --> 43:14.239
I do.

43:14.290 --> 43:15.689
Peter.
