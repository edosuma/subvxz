00:28.128 --> 00:29.762
- Who's going in?

00:29.764 --> 00:31.196
- I better stay here.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.499
- I'm staying with him.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.634
- Alright, who wants
to take the lead here?

00:35.636 --> 00:36.636
Todd.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.649
It's almost 11:30, Tim,

00:50.651 --> 00:52.217
you said I wouldn't
miss my curfew.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.685
- You'll be fine.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.289
- Why do we even hang
out with these guys?

00:57.291 --> 01:01.260
- Because they're the
only ones that get it.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.162
- What is that?
- What?

01:04.431 --> 01:07.466
- Oh shoot, just play it
cool, just play it cool.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.334
- What seems to
be going on here?

01:09.336 --> 01:11.503
- Hi, just getting
some fresh air, sir.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.839
- Fresh air huh?
- Yeah.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.542
- Let's see what we got here?

01:19.546 --> 01:22.781
- Uh, you know, the usual stuff,

01:22.783 --> 01:25.250
school books,
calculators, pencils.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.853
- Alright cut the crap,
what's going on?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.688
- Out for a night drive.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.623
- Just out for a night drive.

01:36.429 --> 01:40.365
- It was just staring
at me, it was creepy.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.468
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.470
- Hey, hey.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.805
- We're screwed.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.176
- Unlock the car.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.131
- I know who you are.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.771
- My parents are gonna kill me.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.173
- Chill.
- Chill?

02:22.275 --> 02:23.809
- It's 12 am, Tim.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.878
I was supposed to be
home half an hour ago

02:25.880 --> 02:27.880
and there are still maggots

02:27.882 --> 02:30.716
in the trunk of my
Satellite, maggots.

02:30.718 --> 02:34.186
- Bran, you have to relax, okay.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.621
We're gonna put up an
elm tree in the trunk.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.889
Everything is gonna be fine.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.324
Does anyone have a dollar?

03:38.685 --> 03:39.518
- Yo Tim.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.752
- Aloha Tonga.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.856
Hello, hello, good day to you.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.858
You guys got your
crew tickets yet?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.927
- Not yet.
- You gotta get on that.

03:48.929 --> 03:49.861
Start thinking about it really.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.563
- I will man.
- Alright.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.765
Ladies, what do we got here?

03:53.767 --> 03:57.936
We have to take care of these
babies for an entire week.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.870
- Is that right?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.005
Does this one have a name?

04:00.007 --> 04:01.707
- Not yet, any suggestions?

04:01.709 --> 04:04.243
- How about Modine?

04:04.245 --> 04:05.444
- That's my mom's name.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.678
- Bran, this is too cute.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.613
Grab a quick picture.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.513
- Tim, we're gonna be late.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.448
- Support the head.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.382
Here we go.

04:10.384 --> 04:10.916
Look at those beautiful eyes.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.917
Okay smile.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.685
Great.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.421
- And we're late, perfect.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.356
- Good luck.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.291
You're gonna love motherhood.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.995
- This Friday is the big
game against our rival,

04:22.997 --> 04:25.897
So come out and
support quarterback,

04:25.899 --> 04:27.866
Brad Hartley and the
rest of the team

04:27.868 --> 04:30.836
as they lead us to
another victory.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.039
Also remember to bring your
IDs to the football game.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.909
It is so annoying when
you don't have them.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.013
- Oh wait.
- What?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.817
- I have something
I want to say.

04:48.921 --> 04:52.858
Good morning, Mount
Vista High School.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.326
This is Tim Timmerman.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.296
Your student body president.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.897
Alright, let's get
down to business.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.932
This weekend is our big
rival football game

05:00.934 --> 05:01.967
against Taft High.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.969
Boo.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.805
- We already announced that.
- Really?

05:07.940 --> 05:10.509
Let me just quickly plug
my halftime show, okay.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.578
Okay guys, this weekend
me and the jungle

05:13.580 --> 05:16.448
have a stellar half time
show planned for you.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.650
It's going to be legendary.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.985
You are not gonna wanna miss it.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.054
It's gonna be amazing.

05:22.056 --> 05:25.791
And finally let me just
say one final thing.

05:32.066 --> 05:35.834
If you're feeling alone,
scared, insecure,

05:38.037 --> 05:42.074
just know that your student
body president loves you.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.778
I love you Mount Vista High.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.080
Thank you guys.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.755
Okay, good announcements right.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.392
Great, just have a few
things to go over.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.861
Let's see what do we have here.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.096
What do we have here.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.864
- What are you plans
for winter formal?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.666
- Winter formal, yeah.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.102
- The president is in
charge of winter formal.

06:10.104 --> 06:13.538
- I am aware of that
and Brandon and I

06:16.109 --> 06:19.478
have worked out
something special.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.712
Been working really hard.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.147
I think you guys are
really gonna love it.

06:22.149 --> 06:27.018
- Well we don't wanna
tell you just yet.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.689
We have to work out a few things,
dot the Is, cross the Ts.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.090
- The dance is in
less than a month.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.458
- I'm aware of that.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.860
Thank you for the
reminder Miss MacKenzie.

06:34.862 --> 06:35.794
- You're so welcome.

06:35.796 --> 06:36.895
- Thank you guys so much.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.796
This is great.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.897
You guys look great.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.866
Alright, see you later.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.576
Why can't she just chill out?

06:51.578 --> 06:52.844
I don't care if she leads.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.080
You think I give a crap
about being president?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.015
I only did it to pad my resume.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.517
- Why did you tell them
we had something planned?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.185
I don't remember
talking about a plan.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.087
- Because we don't
have one yet, Bran.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.523
- Well then why would
you say we did.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.191
- Because I was buying time.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.125
Politicians do it all the time.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.860
It's called pork barreling.

07:08.862 --> 07:09.694
Oh I forgot.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.596
Dr. V, how's it going?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.567
Nice tweed suit.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.768
This is new isn't it?

07:16.770 --> 07:17.769
- You were late
again this morning.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.438
- I know, I'm so sorry.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.572
I was out among the people.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.442
But listen, I'm
applying to Yale soon.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.445
How would you like to write
my letter of recommendation?

07:26.447 --> 07:29.481
- I got a phone call this
morning from the PTA president.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.750
Any idea what that
might have been about?

07:31.752 --> 07:34.186
- No.
- You've no idea?

07:34.188 --> 07:36.955
- She said there were
rumors going around

07:36.957 --> 07:40.459
you're involved with
the assassin game.

07:41.727 --> 07:42.961
Is it true?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.030
- Yes, but it's
just a game, sir.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.164
- It's gambling.

07:46.166 --> 07:50.101
- Tim, you haven't been doing
yourself any favors lately.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.871
- Pretending you were drunk
at the freshman orientation.

07:52.873 --> 07:53.939
- People thought
that was hilarious.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.073
- Hanging out with potheads.

07:55.075 --> 08:01.046
We should have as
student body president.

08:02.215 --> 08:06.084
- Alright, okay, I
will try to do better.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.854
- Tim you know I
want you to succeed.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.923
I just need you to try to
be a better president.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.158
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.798
- About the letter
of recommendation.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.500
Okay sounds good.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.069
I will circle back with
you in a couple of weeks.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.504
Thanks, Dr. V.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.510
- Caucasian males, I would say
between 10 and 15 of them.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.614
I caught the perps around
02300 hours, quarter past.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.515
Most likely Mount Vista kids

08:37.518 --> 08:39.818
because of the big
rival game coming up.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.988
I was just minding
my own business

08:42.990 --> 08:44.155
so one of the big guys
came up behind me

08:44.157 --> 08:45.924
and he kind of tried to choke me

08:45.926 --> 08:48.226
and I reverted back to
my time in the war.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.729
- They're using road
kill this year.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.230
- Did you get a
vehicle description?

08:52.232 --> 08:53.999
- Yeah it was very dark but
it was a vintage vehicle,

08:54.001 --> 08:55.066
brown color.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.037
Hey, listen is that
a Smith & Wesson?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.039
- Glock 40.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.708
- You know the purple
bowl, you silly goose.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.977
Yeah the one with the pretty
pattern on the bottom.

09:05.979 --> 09:10.549
Yeah, that's gonna fit the
entire salad, I know it.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.884
Of course I love your salads.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.920
As much as I love you, sweetie.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.988
Okay, I gotta go.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.223
I'll talk to you later.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.758
Kisses, love you

09:21.895 --> 09:23.061
Women, right?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.932
Okay what is your last name?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.234
- Timmerman, Tim Timmerman.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.270
- Okay here you are.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.640
Now Tim, have you decided
how many colleges

09:35.642 --> 09:37.309
you want to apply to?

09:37.311 --> 09:38.843
- Just Yale.
- Yale?

09:38.845 --> 09:41.613
- Yes.
- The Ivy League school.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.251
- Well going into politics,
it's a perfect fit.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.622
- Okay, your SATs and your ACTs
are definitely good enough

09:50.624 --> 09:54.626
to go to Yale and that's
yummy and your GPA...

09:57.598 --> 09:59.998
about changing some
of those grades.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.701
- Look, Tim, I'm gonna
play honesty planet

10:02.703 --> 10:04.336
with you right now.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.272
With a GPA like this,
Yale is gonna be

10:07.274 --> 10:08.974
pretty much out of your range.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.241
- Well that's pretty
presumptuous.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.044
I would suggest the
University of Utah

10:13.046 --> 10:14.646
but with your grades, boy.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.281
- All my brothers went to U of U

10:16.283 --> 10:17.916
and besides I have the
presidential scholarship

10:17.918 --> 10:19.050
if I want it.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.386
- Uh no, see the
presidential scholarship

10:21.388 --> 10:25.624
at the U of U requires
a GPA of at least 3.0.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.293
You've got a 2.45.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.394
- Thanks for the reminder.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.795
- I think a good fit for you

10:30.797 --> 10:33.264
is gonna be Salt Lake
Community College.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.400
- Timmermans do not go to SLCC.

10:35.402 --> 10:39.704
- Tim, community college is
nothing to be ashamed of.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.006
- Good to know.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.109
What a joke.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.977
I didn't even see a diploma
on that guy's wall.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.179
SLCC, can you imagine, Bran?

10:48.181 --> 10:50.281
My brothers would never
let me live that down.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.716
- Braj!
- Braj.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.785
- What's up dude?

10:54.687 --> 10:56.054
- Gotta get the lead out.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.322
Do you wanna get a burrito?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.256
I got free student
government coupons.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.659
- Say no more, man, say no more.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.793
Come here, come here.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.061
Tim, this is my cousin.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.863
He's up here visiting
from Salt Lake.

11:04.865 --> 11:05.864
This here is Tim.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.931
He's our student body president

11:06.933 --> 11:08.266
and the same guy who did

11:08.268 --> 11:09.300
that bitching announcement
this morning.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.969
Just a solid guy.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.671
Okay, cool, let's go
get some munchies.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.706
Oh my mom's got
the brajer mobile

11:14.708 --> 11:16.775
for the day so can Bran drive?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.043
- Actually I don't-

11:18.045 --> 11:20.845
- Yeah totally, let's go.
- Alright.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.348
- Hey Tim.
- Kevin.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.385
- Kevin's actually
my older brother.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.187
I'm Jessup.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.322
- Oh Jessup, that's right.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.257
Hang on a second guys.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.459
I'm gonna talk to this kid.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.760
How's it going man?

11:35.762 --> 11:36.928
- Where you off to?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.463
- El Azteca.
- That sounds fun.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.065
Can I tag along?

11:41.467 --> 11:43.201
- You know, my man, it's a
little crowded in that car.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.370
- Braj, let's go.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.338
- Listen, think I could
call you sometime?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.240
I just wanted to
ask what it's like

11:49.242 --> 11:53.945
and how one might go
about getting elected.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.947
- You know what, why don't I
give you my pager number.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.883
- Wow, that would be so awesome.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.152
- Come on braj, there's
hungry mouths to feed.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.154
Let go.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.824
- Alright, it's
877-PREZ with a z.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.458
Can you remember that, dude?

12:06.460 --> 12:07.492
- Got it.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.326
Thank you so much.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.761
You're the best.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.829
- No problem dude.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.831
Later.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.370
- What's wrong, braj?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.806
You seem a little
down in the dumps.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.509
- It's the administration
coming down on me again.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.745
- Man I'm telling you,
they just don't get you.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.847
You're like a diamond
in the rough.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.081
- Thanks, man.

12:31.784 --> 12:33.952
- You sure this is gonna work?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.920
- Well, it's true
that he's home sick

12:35.922 --> 12:38.790
but Ross Thompson pulls stuff
like this all the time.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.058
- Listen little cuz, the
way the game assassins

12:40.060 --> 12:41.526
works is like this.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.795
Every year a few hundred
students put $5 into a pot.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.330
Right, you get a pellet
gun and the name

12:45.332 --> 12:46.397
of somebody you shoot.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.902
You get the name that he
had, so on, so forth.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.771
Last man standing wins the pot.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.540
- Only rule is, you can't shoot
anyone on school campus.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.941
- Every year this
weirdo goth kid

12:56.943 --> 12:58.476
named Ross Thompson
wins the game.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.444
He's the worse.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.980
- Every year but this year.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.983
- Hey Mike.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.251
I didn't know you lived here.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.485
- Hey what's up man?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.554
- My car battery
is actually dead.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.889
I just wanted to see if you had

13:10.891 --> 13:13.324
some jumper cables
I could borrow.

13:17.897 --> 13:18.963
- Yo Vassey.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.436
- How could I be so stupid?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.538
- Who's name did you have?

13:26.540 --> 13:28.473
- Brad Hartley.
- Ooh.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.308
- That was creative with the
car and everything though.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.544
- Just an old assassin's
trick, my friend.

13:32.546 --> 13:33.546
Sweet robe.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.317
- Anyone want a tug?
- What?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.485
Don't smoke in the car.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.086
We're gonna get- -
No it's gonna fine.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.121
It's gonna be alright.

13:45.826 --> 13:48.827
- Stop, get you
off of this crap.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.229
- Speaking of crap, what is
this we're listening to?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.864
Here stick this in.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.007
- Ooh.
- That's more like it.

14:05.544 --> 14:09.614
You gotta hold it
steady, braj, steady.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.021
- Slow down a little bit, Brad.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.090
- Why?
- I'm gonna give

14:19.092 --> 14:20.358
these guys a show.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.560
- What?
- Here just hold this.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.095
Perfect.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.196
I'm gonna teen wolf here.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.431
- Tim, no Tim.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.316
- Yeah.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.526
- Tim, Tim get down, Tim.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.237
- What's this?

15:09.141 --> 15:11.242
- Brandon could you give
us a moment please?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.678
I need to speak with Tim alone.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.954
You're just dang lucky
they didn't charge you.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.055
- It wasn't mine.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.958
- Well who's was it then?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.259
I really didn't want
to have to do this

15:28.261 --> 15:31.296
but I may have to impeach you.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.964
- What does that mean?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.599
- Believe me it's not
something that I want to do-

15:34.601 --> 15:36.567
- No what does impeach mean?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.369
I don't know what
that word means.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.439
- It means you would be
removed as president.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.707
- What?
- I have given you

15:42.709 --> 15:45.143
every opportunity to change.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.644
- The joint wasn't mine, sir.

15:46.646 --> 15:50.014
- This is not about
the joint, Tim.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.617
I'm putting you on
formal probation

15:52.619 --> 15:56.187
until I can set a date for
an impeachment hearing.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.624
Until then MacKenzie Miller
will be acting president.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.159
- Oh you gotta be kidding me.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.727
- You are not to give
morning announcements.

16:02.729 --> 16:06.364
You are not to perform at
the half time this Friday.

16:06.366 --> 16:11.736
At council meetings until after
the hearing, you got that?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.672
Your parking pass
and your sweater.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.008
I am done messing around.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.614
- Howdy Tim.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.480
- Hold still please.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.021
- President Clinton?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.356
- Last time I looked
in the mirror.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.392
Rough day today, huh Tim?

17:07.394 --> 17:10.127
- I said hold still please.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.295
- You know my name?

17:11.297 --> 17:13.031
- Who doesn't?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.567
You know, you remind me a lot
of myself when I was your age.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.368
- Really?
- My sixth grade teacher,

17:18.371 --> 17:22.040
Kathleen Scheer once said,
Billy when you grow up

17:22.041 --> 17:23.441
you're either gonna
be a governor

17:23.443 --> 17:26.778
or get in a whole
lot of trouble.

17:26.780 --> 17:31.416
I think I fulfilled both
of those predictions.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.785
But seriously, I look
at you and I say,

17:33.787 --> 17:36.187
Tim, you are America's hope.

17:37.623 --> 17:41.192
- Wow, that's a
great compliment.

17:41.194 --> 17:44.495
But what do you mean
by America's hope?

17:53.305 --> 17:54.305
Bill?

17:57.176 --> 18:01.079
- What part of hold still
don't you understand?

18:15.194 --> 18:17.328
- Oh Tim, you poor thing.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.765
Have a seat on the couch.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.769
Can I get you
something to drink?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.337
- Yeah, that'd be great thanks.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.271
- I am so annoyed.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.473
This whole thing is ridiculous.

18:28.475 --> 18:34.112
- I know and I had such
great plans for this year.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.858
- I was really looking forward
to us working together.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.227
- I just don't think Dr.
V gets me.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.263
I'm not an Xs and Os
guy, I'm a people guy.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.831
- Exactly.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.701
- It's been so difficult with
MacKenzie on the cabinet.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.170
She still hasn't
gotten over the loss.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.371
- Ugh MacKenzie.

19:02.774 --> 19:07.278
You know, Carl tends to
rush into decisions.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.546
Let me talk to him.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.380
- Really?

19:09.382 --> 19:10.248
You would do that?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.415
Are you sure?

19:11.417 --> 19:13.251
- Has he set a hearing date yet?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.852
- No there's no date yet.

19:14.854 --> 19:19.824
- Well then I am gonna make
sure you don't get impeached.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.726
I mean this whole
thing is a joke.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.163
- That would be so great.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.464
Thank you Miss Murphy.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.534
- Call it an early
birthday present.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.244
- Oh that's it.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.614
That's the car and
those are the plates.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.194
Oh geez.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.463
No, no, no!

20:10.676 --> 20:11.943
- Dude, you're like
the most bitchingest

20:11.945 --> 20:14.412
student body president
this school's ever had.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.646
I think the problem
is these people

20:15.648 --> 20:19.350
just don't appreciate
your leadership skills.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.520
- Hi are you Tim Timmerman?

20:22.522 --> 20:24.522
- Yeah.
- I'm Sydney Anderson.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.290
I'm the SBP at Taft High.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.692
You're the Mount
Vista SBP right?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.727
- Yeah, that's right.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.362
- Are you guys doing a
food drive this year?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.830
- I'm not sure.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.965
- Well I was wondering
because the homeless shelter

20:33.967 --> 20:36.267
in town is really
in need of food.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.802
Is your council maybe
interested in partnering

20:37.804 --> 20:39.503
with us for a can drive.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.871
- Okay nice.
- Oh well I was thinking

20:40.873 --> 20:45.376
that was done at our school,
you know the deer thing.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.345
- Oh I heard about that,
that was terrible.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.280
- Do you think your council
will be interested?

20:49.282 --> 20:52.550
- We're pretty busy these
days but nice to meet you.

20:52.552 --> 20:53.985
- Oh I'm sorry,
what did you say?

20:53.987 --> 20:56.621
- We'll see but I really gotta
get to the can, alright.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.589
- Oh well could you
at least hand out

20:58.591 --> 21:00.992
some of these flyers for us?

21:00.994 --> 21:05.463
And here's my number in
case you change your mind.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.300
Have you ever used a national
relay service before?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.935
- I don't think so.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.771
- Well you'll figure it out.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.939
- Okay.
- Bye.

21:16.675 --> 21:20.011
- I see our deer prank has
made a fine impression.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.279
- What the crap is this?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.713
Food drive?

21:22.715 --> 21:25.950
I don't have time for this.
- Alright.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.319
- Ugh.
- What?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.054
- The student body
president just threw away

21:30.056 --> 21:32.723
all the flyers I gave him.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.924
- Why did she talk funny?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.393
- Oh she's deaf.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.894
- How do you know that?

21:36.896 --> 21:38.296
- Read an article about
her in the weekly Herald.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.030
Sorry, excuse me.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.398
- They wrote a story about her?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.900
- Yeah, pretty impressive chick.

21:48.373 --> 21:49.373
- Halftime.

22:06.425 --> 22:09.327
- Braj look, I know that
you don't care for her

22:09.329 --> 22:11.395
but she is such a Betty.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.098
- Whatever you say, dude.

22:19.938 --> 22:22.006
- MacKenzie, do a herky.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.109
Come on please?

22:25.111 --> 22:26.444
She's so hot.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.046
Chastity, do a herky.

22:36.455 --> 22:37.455
Oh man.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.991
Sucks you're not gonna get to
do your halftime show though.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.760
- Tell me about it.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.663
I'm getting a page.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.731
- Who is it?

22:47.799 --> 22:49.400
- It's that Jessup kid.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.402
- That kid's a piece of work.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.604
Hey, why'd you even give
him your pager number?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.106
- I don't know, I
felt bad for him.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.440
- You're such a good dude, man.

22:56.442 --> 22:57.808
- Well thanks.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.610
- Hey Tim, I heard you got
impeached man, that sucks.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.145
- I didn't get impeached bro.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.513
- Right on.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.484
- I'm gonna get you.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.655
- Ross Thompson's got your
name for assassins huh?

23:11.657 --> 23:12.657
- Yeah.

23:14.626 --> 23:16.026
- Bummer.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.928
What's the pot up to again?
- A thousand bones.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.430
- Okay.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.865
That's enough to
buy a school huh?

23:20.867 --> 23:25.436
But Ross Thompson's got something
coming to him this year.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.938
- That's it for the first half.

23:27.940 --> 23:32.042
Jerry Wooley, president
of the Wooley Foundation,

23:32.044 --> 23:35.646
along with US Senator
Pete Anderson.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.017
- Is that really a senator?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.453
- Yeah, Pete Anderson,
US Senator.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.656
- I read the paper, dude.
- You do?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.991
- Yeah, knowledge is power.

23:46.993 --> 23:51.195
It's a pleasure to be here at
this rivalry game tonight.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.631
I'm even more delighted
to be out of session.

23:55.168 --> 23:59.437
100 years ago I actually
attended Mount Vista High.

23:59.439 --> 24:02.173
I was the student body
president in 1960.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.474
- No way.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.176
- And back then we had an award

24:05.178 --> 24:07.545
called the Hope
of America award.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.547
- Hope of America,
how do I know that?

24:09.549 --> 24:11.615
- I don't believe that
I'd be here today

24:11.617 --> 24:13.184
if it wasn't for this award.

24:13.186 --> 24:16.454
I'm delighted to announce
that we are bringing

24:16.456 --> 24:20.458
the Hope of America award
back on December 15th.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.694
The Wooley Foundation will
choose one lucky student

24:23.696 --> 24:26.931
from both Taft High
and Mount Vista High

24:26.933 --> 24:29.600
to join me and my
daughter, Sydney.

24:29.602 --> 24:32.570
Sydney, why don't you come
on out here and join us?

24:32.572 --> 24:33.737
There she is.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.942
- The chick's his daughter.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.109
- Yeah they mentioned
it in the article.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.177
A really good piece.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.712
- Why didn't you tell me that?

24:41.714 --> 24:43.948
- I don't know, why
does it matter, braj?

24:43.950 --> 24:47.218
- Politics, braj, it's
all about who you know.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.487
- The two winners of the
Hope of America award

24:49.489 --> 24:51.989
will join Sydney
as a page for me,

24:51.991 --> 24:55.493
this winter semester
in Washington, DC.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.697
And one last thing,
I strongly believe

24:59.699 --> 25:03.501
that grades and test scores
are not a true indicator

25:03.503 --> 25:05.970
of a person's
leadership potential.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.238
- Amen.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.207
- So when the Wooley's
Foundation interviews,

25:10.209 --> 25:12.877
they will be looking
for just one thing;

25:12.879 --> 25:14.678
leadership experience.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.213
Well that's all from me.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.517
Good luck and enjoy
the rest of the game.

25:27.092 --> 25:28.092
- Oh hey, Tim.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.528
- Hey Sylvia, love the new do.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.696
- Do you think I could
get one of those

25:32.698 --> 25:34.532
Hope of America applications?

25:34.534 --> 25:35.666
- Absolutely.

25:44.142 --> 25:45.142
- Thanks.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.320
- Not because of me
but because of you.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.588
Only cause of you.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.723
- Stop it, you just stop it.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.627
- That's what you get.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.731
National relay service.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.267
- Yes, I'm sorry,
what'd you say?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.936
- National relay service.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.304
This is the telephone
service for the deaf.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.806
You calling somebody who's deaf?

26:15.808 --> 26:17.608
- Yes I am.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.576
What do I do?

26:18.578 --> 26:22.646
- I need the person's
name, sugar.

26:29.087 --> 26:29.920
- Phone's for you.

26:29.922 --> 26:30.922
It's a boy.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.001
- I'm serious, he was
just staring at me.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.636
It was creepy.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.105
- No way, now that is freaky.

26:49.374 --> 26:52.610
You know that's the
damn devil right there.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.811
Oh, here she is.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.780
Hello, this is Sydney.

26:58.183 --> 26:59.650
- I'm still here.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.352
- Is that what you want
me to write, baby?

27:01.354 --> 27:03.654
- Oh she's on the phone.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.255
No, no, no, no, no.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.692
Just write, hi, this
is Tim Timmerman,

27:10.261 --> 27:12.963
student body president
at Mount Vista High.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.732
How are you today?

27:19.938 --> 27:22.339
- She says, I'm busy.
- Okay.

27:23.708 --> 27:27.811
Tell her I'd like to talk
about the canned food drive.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.251
- She says, I saw you
throw away my flyers.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.252
- Did I do that?

27:35.254 --> 27:41.091
Listen, I am super jazzed
about this canned food drive.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.963
I just, I can't stop
coming up with ideas.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.366
- Really, like what?

27:49.368 --> 27:52.670
- Oh well I thought it might
be nice if we would meet.

27:52.672 --> 27:53.437
Maybe I could come to your house

27:53.439 --> 27:55.272
so we could meet face to face.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.674
I think you're gonna
be really impressed

27:56.676 --> 27:57.875
with the ideas
I've come up with.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.444
More cans than you can imagine.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.682
- Damn boy, you really know
how to talk to a woman.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.452
- Perks of being president,
that's a good question.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.454
Well you get the best
parking spot in the school.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.456
You get to make morning
announcements, free burritos.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.225
- Hey Tim.
- Hey man.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.694
Random people know who you are.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.229
I have no idea who that kid was.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.001
- Do you really think a guy
like me could get elected?

28:24.003 --> 28:25.736
- Sure.
- But I'm not friends

28:25.738 --> 28:28.005
with any of the popular kids.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.273
- Are you kidding me?

28:29.275 --> 28:30.908
You see me chumming
around with Brad Hartley

28:30.910 --> 28:32.176
and the rest of
the popular kids?

28:32.178 --> 28:33.010
Here watch this.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.344
Brad, hey Brad.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.080
Brad, Bradley, Brad.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.718
See, he doesn't like me.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.052
Now let me ask you a question.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.288
How many kids go to this school?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.090
- I don't know, 1500?

28:47.792 --> 28:50.294
- And how many of those
kids are popular?

28:50.296 --> 28:51.995
- Not many.

28:51.997 --> 28:52.997
Ohh.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.200
- Now you're starting
to catch on.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.102
Politics is a very simple game.

28:58.104 --> 29:01.138
All you need is 51% of the vote

29:01.140 --> 29:03.841
and who's gonna
give you that 51%?

29:03.843 --> 29:05.275
- Hey Tim.
- Hey man.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.945
Your biggest challenge is
that you started campaigning

29:07.947 --> 29:10.247
just a little bit too late.

29:12.016 --> 29:13.183
Listen I gotta get going.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.085
Let's talk about this more.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.054
You've got a lot to
learn, my friend.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.189
- Okay, thanks Tim.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.257
- Bran, hey.

29:21.893 --> 29:24.194
Hey, where were
you this morning?

29:24.196 --> 29:25.129
I had to get a ride from my mom.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.497
It was really embarrassing.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.065
Listen what're you
doing second period?

29:28.067 --> 29:29.067
- Why?

29:30.101 --> 29:32.803
- I'm gonna need
you to shlup man.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.506
- What for?
- Oh no big deal.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.808
I just need to go to a
US senator's house.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.109
Senator Pete Anderson.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.878
This same senator
who's sponsoring

29:40.880 --> 29:42.479
the Hope of America award.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.047
His daughter is the
student body president

29:44.049 --> 29:45.549
at Taft High School.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.218
She's my in with this guy and
get this, Taft High, sorry.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.987
Taft High doesn't
have school today.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.188
She wants me to come
over to her house

29:51.190 --> 29:53.223
to talk about partnering
our councils up

29:53.225 --> 29:54.525
or something like that.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.960
- But you're on probation.

29:57.862 --> 30:01.899
- Yeah, Miss Murphy's
gonna take care of that.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.802
Bran, I don't think you understand
how huge this is for me.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.069
If I get in with the
chick's father,

30:06.071 --> 30:08.005
I'm a shoo in for the
Hope of America award.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.439
Then, I'll be rubbing
shoulders on the hill

30:09.441 --> 30:11.842
with Pete fetching Anderson.

30:12.877 --> 30:14.912
- I can't miss this class.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.414
- Bran, please, this is huge.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.151
Everything is
falling into place.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.452
This is a senator.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.854
You how those guys operate.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.923
One phone call and
I'm into Yale.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.925
It's called a power endorsement.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.860
- Lastly do not forget to
bring your money tomorrow

30:29.862 --> 30:33.030
for the bake sale in
support of the chess club.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.566
Oh one last announcement.

30:35.568 --> 30:38.235
It has come to our attention
that some of our students

30:38.237 --> 30:41.872
performed an act of vandalism
at Taft High School

30:41.874 --> 30:43.941
involving a dead animal.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.578
A $200 reward will
be given to anyone

30:47.580 --> 30:52.015
who has any information
regarding this despicable act.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.353
- Okay come on Bran,
let's get going.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.321
I told her we'd be there by 10.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.422
We're gonna be super late.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.324
- Are you kidding?
- What?

31:00.326 --> 31:02.993
- Did you not just
hear the announcement?

31:02.995 --> 31:04.428
- What?

31:04.430 --> 31:05.996
Oh you mean the deer thing?

31:05.998 --> 31:08.232
- Tim, we're probably
gonna get expelled.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.867
- No, who's gonna say anything?

31:09.869 --> 31:12.469
- Guy probably doesn't
even know his own name.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.338
Come on let's get going. - No.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.473
- Bran.
- Tim, I said no.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.641
- Bran, come on, I really
need you on this one, okay.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.977
I need to put my best
foot forward if-

31:19.979 --> 31:24.214
- My parents don't want me
hanging out with you anymore.

31:27.318 --> 31:29.386
- They said that?
- Yeah.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.025
I'm sorry, I gotta get to class.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.576
- What's up dude?

31:52.578 --> 31:54.478
- You got the braj
mobile here today.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.979
- Yeah.
- Good.

31:55.981 --> 31:57.247
I need you to take me somewhere.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.016
- I can't slough
this class, man.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.517
- Why?
- It's welding.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.019
It's my future.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.221
I'm sorry.

32:08.059 --> 32:09.526
- Jessup, Jessup.

32:21.406 --> 32:22.239
- What's up, Tim?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.941
- Hey Mr. Hadley.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.210
I just need to pull Jessup
Jacobs out of class real quick.

32:27.212 --> 32:30.981
We just have official
government business.

32:31.716 --> 32:33.450
- Wow, this is huge.

32:43.261 --> 32:46.196
- Hi, how's it going.
- Hi.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.265
You don't have to
yell, it's okay.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.033
- Oh I didn't know.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.069
- I'm hard of hearing so
I can hear a little bit.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.971
I can read your lips.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.339
- Oh, outstanding.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.608
This is Jessup Jacobs,

32:58.610 --> 33:00.510
he's my protege. - Hi.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.287
- Is this fireplace wood or gas?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.555
- I'm not sure.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.625
- It's probably gas.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.030
You mind if we
take a quick tour?

33:20.032 --> 33:21.098
- Where are your parents?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.299
- I think they're out golfing

33:22.301 --> 33:24.368
but we should probably
head back in too.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.069
I don't have much time today.

33:26.071 --> 33:29.773
- Sure, this is totally
the type of place

33:29.775 --> 33:31.608
I'm gonna get when I get older.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.676
How much do senators
make by the way,

33:32.678 --> 33:34.611
if you don't mind me asking?

33:34.613 --> 33:36.313
- Oh, not that much but my dad

33:36.315 --> 33:38.782
was a lobbyist before
he became a senator so.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.784
- A lobbyist huh?

33:40.786 --> 33:45.088
I bet you guys throw some
killer parties here.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.357
Oh my gosh, is that
what I think it is?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.793
Okay Jessup, fire it up.

33:57.468 --> 33:58.502
Do it again.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.505
Okay do it again.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.739
- Wait.
- Okay.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.047
- I don't know what's
going on here.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.415
Speed it up maybe.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.290
Ooh.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.659
Okay, hang on, look at that.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.094
- I don't have a lot of time,
we should probably get going.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.330
- Wait just a couple more.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.067
- Are you okay?

34:30.668 --> 34:33.235
- Wasn't ready for that one.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.141
Love Corses spencers.

34:40.645 --> 34:42.279
- So what are your ideas?
- Hmm?

34:42.281 --> 34:44.447
- For the canned food drive.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.217
You said you had a
bunch of ideas.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.452
- Right, yeah.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.657
Fetch, I forgot my notes.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.726
- Can you remember anything
off the top of your head?

34:56.728 --> 34:59.830
- Yes, I was thinking
that we could, we should-

35:04.469 --> 35:06.570
- What about the
dance idea, Tim?

35:06.572 --> 35:07.572
- Hmm?

35:08.573 --> 35:10.774
- The idea for the
combined school dance?

35:10.776 --> 35:13.143
- Yes, the winter formal.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.879
We did talk about
that didn't we?

35:15.881 --> 35:19.683
Yes we could have a
competition to see who

35:19.685 --> 35:23.520
can bring more cans
between the two schools.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.423
- A combined school dance.
- Yeah.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.327
- That's a really good idea.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.430
- Isn't that great?

35:33.432 --> 35:34.297
- Who would host it?

35:34.299 --> 35:35.866
This is great.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.200
- You guys talk about that.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.803
- Yeah it's just
down to the right.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.204
- Thank you so much.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.305
Oh ice.

35:54.519 --> 35:55.752
Hello Senator.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.431
Veto, veto, reconsider.

36:59.483 --> 37:01.451
- Can I help you?

37:01.453 --> 37:03.520
- Yes, I apologize.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.988
I'm so sorry.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.591
- You should start with
telling me who you are.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.926
- Yes, I'm Tim Timmerman.

37:09.928 --> 37:13.797
I'm student body president
of Mount Vista High School.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.265
- Well you probably
shouldn't be in here.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.467
- No, no I shouldn't.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.336
- Tim?
- Hey Sydney.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.372
Should we meet now?

37:22.374 --> 37:25.675
- I could've sworn you said
second door on the left.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.245
- Oh, dad we're just
planning a dance.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.813
- Ah.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.514
- Yeah so I should
probably get going.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.583
It was nice to meet you.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.659
Ugh I feel so bad about what
happened with your dad.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.462
- I'm sorry what,
what'd you say?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.330
- Oh I was just saying I
was kind of embarrassed

37:47.332 --> 37:48.565
about what happened
with your dad.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.733
- Oh don't worry about it.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.401
He just gets a little
bored and crank

37:51.403 --> 37:53.403
when he's not in session.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.639
I'm really excited about
this dance, guys.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.307
- Yeah, it's gonna
be so much fun.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.443
Right away don't you think?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.611
We could meet this Saturday.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.346
We could meet at my school.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.814
- Oh you know what, I think
you and I should probably

38:04.816 --> 38:06.950
meet privately a couple
times before we do that.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.752
- Why?
- Just so we can work

38:08.754 --> 38:12.656
on a couple things, like dot
our Is, cross our Ts, etc.

38:12.658 --> 38:15.025
- I don't know, the dance
is only a month away so-

38:15.027 --> 38:17.994
- Saturday will be good.
- Oh, okay great.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.396
I'm really excited.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.698
- Me too, let's do it.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.532
- See you guys later.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.600
- Alright see you.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.069
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.804
- You were really great
in there, by the way.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.406
- Really?
- Yeah, that dance idea

38:29.408 --> 38:30.807
was brilliant.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.443
You are deceptively brilliant,
you know that Jessup.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.445
- You know-

38:35.314 --> 38:37.080
- Wait a minute.
- What?

38:38.082 --> 38:40.050
- I heard something.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.384
- What is it?

39:14.852 --> 39:15.852
- Hi

40:16.747 --> 40:19.549
- I need to get a
picture, smile.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.631
I got you something special.

40:42.473 --> 40:45.642
I signed us up for
salsa dancing lessons.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.544
- Wow, thanks, Monica.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.113
- I thought that
you could add it

40:50.115 --> 40:54.017
to your list of talents
on your Yale application.

40:57.054 --> 41:00.123
- Oh our first class is next
Saturday at seven o'clock.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.558
- Okay, great.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.227
Thank you.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.597
- Well thank you so
much for having me

41:07.599 --> 41:08.965
to your birthday super bash.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.233
- Later Tim.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.802
- Later dude.
- Thanks, man.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.837
Hey, listen, have
you had a chance

41:13.839 --> 41:15.205
to talk to Dr. V yet?

41:15.207 --> 41:17.240
- No not yet but I was
actually thinking

41:17.242 --> 41:19.542
it would be a really good
idea for us to get together

41:19.544 --> 41:22.779
a few times before then to
figure out how to do this.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.614
- Okay do you think we could
get the impeachment hearing

41:24.616 --> 41:26.149
going this week?

41:26.151 --> 41:27.584
- I don't know, why?

41:27.586 --> 41:30.553
But I need to get it going
as ASAP as possible.

41:30.555 --> 41:33.056
- Okay well I'll
see what I can do.

41:33.058 --> 41:36.125
- Great party, Tim, but
we've gotta go, curfew.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.027
- Alright, well thanks
man, thanks for coming by.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.529
- Hey where was Brandon tonight?

41:39.531 --> 41:40.830
- I don't know, didn't stop by.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.099
- That kid's a riot.
- Is he?

41:43.101 --> 41:46.002
- See you Miss Murphy.
- Bye guys.

41:47.104 --> 41:50.507
So should I pick you up
at 6:30 on Saturday?

41:50.509 --> 41:53.643
Here's what we'll do, we'll
get Jessup to fill in for me.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.611
Good guy.

41:54.613 --> 41:55.612
- Oh no no, I don't think so.

41:55.614 --> 41:56.579
- No it's gonna be great.

41:56.581 --> 41:58.114
He's a natural dancer.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.582
Jessup, Jessup.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.618
- Oh excuse me.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.620
Hold that thought,
I'll be right back.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.221
- Jessup, salsa, have fun.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.256
- Salsa, oh okay.

42:06.258 --> 42:07.790
Hi Miss Murphy, how are you?

42:07.792 --> 42:08.758
- Hi Jessup.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.993
- So salsa.

42:09.995 --> 42:15.164
Because it's not even from
like Puerto Rico or Cuba

42:15.166 --> 42:16.733
which is where it's
influenced by.

42:16.735 --> 42:18.568
It actually just
originated in New York

42:18.570 --> 42:21.604
- That's wonderful Jessup,
really that's great.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.606
So have a good night.

42:25.242 --> 42:27.544
Bye - Well if you need,

42:27.546 --> 42:30.647
I can walk you to
your car or okay

42:47.731 --> 42:49.666
- Save Tim Timmerman.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.101
Save Tim Timmerman. - Sure.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.269
- Sign my petition.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.771
Sign my petition.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.245
Hey man.

43:02.247 --> 43:05.882
Listen I had a really funny
memory this morning.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.851
You remember that time in fifth
grade when Scotty Shumway

43:08.853 --> 43:10.353
tried to fight you?

43:10.355 --> 43:12.255
He kept pushing you
and egging you on

43:12.257 --> 43:15.892
and you're like, Scotty
I'm not gonna fight you.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.360
Scotty I'm not gonna fight you

43:17.362 --> 43:19.362
and then wham you punched
him right in the face.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.030
He was on the ground bleeding

43:21.032 --> 43:22.298
and then you just
look at everyone

43:22.300 --> 43:26.302
and you're just like,
did I just do that?

43:26.304 --> 43:31.074
That's when I knew that we would
be best friends, forever.

43:31.076 --> 43:32.942
- So what's that?

43:32.944 --> 43:35.745
- This is a petition, Monica
thought it'd be a good idea

43:35.747 --> 43:38.281
for me to have everyone sign it
so I wouldn't get impeached.

43:38.283 --> 43:39.983
Do you wanna sign it?

43:39.985 --> 43:41.284
- Not really.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.052
- Hey Tim, killer
party last night.

43:43.054 --> 43:45.822
- Hey guys.
- Yeah, I gotta go.

43:46.991 --> 43:49.392
- Do you wanna get a burrito
or something after school?

43:49.394 --> 43:50.793
- I'm pretty busy.

43:50.795 --> 43:51.728
We got a lot of homework
to do and stuff so.

43:51.730 --> 43:52.695
- Are you sure?

43:52.697 --> 43:53.863
- Yeah.
- Alright.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.800
- See ya.
- See you later, Tim.

43:57.802 --> 43:58.802
- Alright.

44:01.939 --> 44:03.940
- What's that, Tim?

44:03.942 --> 44:06.275
- It's a petition
to me reinstated.

44:06.277 --> 44:07.644
- I'll sign it.

44:07.646 --> 44:10.013
You got screwed man.
- Thanks, man.

44:16.286 --> 44:18.788
That's 1200 signatures, sir.

44:18.790 --> 44:20.289
1237 to be exact.

44:26.830 --> 44:28.331
- It's out of my hands, Tim.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.899
You know how much I like you.

44:29.901 --> 44:31.868
You know how much I
want you to do well.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.037
But every time I give you a
chance, you let me down.

44:34.039 --> 44:37.874
I'm sorry but my
reputation is on the line.

44:58.863 --> 45:00.096
- What the fetch?

45:05.035 --> 45:07.804
- How high do you wanna go, Tim?

45:07.806 --> 45:10.773
- Oh, hey President Clinton.

45:10.775 --> 45:13.409
- Here comes the underdog.
- What?

45:16.046 --> 45:18.448
Okay I'm gonna jump off now.

45:22.853 --> 45:24.353
Good to see you again.

45:24.355 --> 45:27.990
- Likewise, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

45:27.992 --> 45:31.994
- Yeah.
- So what're you gonna do now?

45:31.996 --> 45:33.763
- I don't know.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.832
The only chance of winning
that Hope of America award

45:35.834 --> 45:39.335
- Tim, take this for
what it's worth.

45:39.337 --> 45:41.504
But history is
filled with examples

45:41.506 --> 45:43.139
of fortune favoring leaders

45:43.141 --> 45:46.109
when their backs were
up against the wall.

45:46.111 --> 45:48.745
You know, armies
approaching and then

45:48.747 --> 45:51.981
right in the moment of crisis,

45:51.983 --> 45:55.785
the clouds part and
destiny shines.

45:55.787 --> 46:00.790
- Tim, you need to believe
in a thing called hope.

46:00.792 --> 46:01.991
Hope, Tim, hope.

46:13.437 --> 46:14.437
- Bill?

46:41.266 --> 46:42.865
- Thanks for meeting
with us, you guys.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.433
- Thank you for
having us here today.

46:44.435 --> 46:47.303
- I thought we discussed
having your whole council

46:47.305 --> 46:48.905
and your advisor here.

46:48.907 --> 46:52.942
It appears however though that
many of my council members

46:52.944 --> 46:55.011
are buried with responsibilities
that I've given them.

46:55.013 --> 46:58.181
I have been able to bring
some of my cabinet members

46:58.183 --> 46:59.849
here today though.

46:59.851 --> 47:01.284
- Oh okay, I just didn't know
if we could plan something

47:01.286 --> 47:03.920
so big without having
all your people here.

47:03.922 --> 47:08.024
- Actually, we come
bearing some bad news.

47:08.026 --> 47:11.360
So originally we had scheduled
the dance for November 20th,

47:11.362 --> 47:13.563
however, it appears
that there's also

47:13.565 --> 47:17.533
an important swim meet
scheduled for that same night.

47:17.535 --> 47:20.903
- Oh I think we'd
be open to moving

47:20.905 --> 47:23.206
the dance back a week, right?

47:24.541 --> 47:25.942
Why don't you call the DJ and
make sure that still works

47:25.944 --> 47:27.944
for him, okay? - Sure.

47:27.946 --> 47:31.013
- And we just need to divide
up some responsibilities.

47:31.015 --> 47:33.249
Would you guys be willing
to help out with-

47:33.251 --> 47:34.984
- Excuse me, Sydney.

47:36.053 --> 47:38.154
Should I just tell her?

47:38.156 --> 47:39.388
- Sure.
- Okay.

47:42.326 --> 47:46.963
Tim was too embarrassed to tell
you this so I guess I will.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.865
He brought the idea up
to the administration

47:48.867 --> 47:51.200
and they immediately
shot him down.

47:51.202 --> 47:54.370
The winter formal is sort of a
sacred event at Mount Vista.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.138
They've done it the
same way for 50 years

47:56.140 --> 47:59.308
and they just can't
stomach change.

47:59.310 --> 48:00.543
- I don't understand.

48:00.545 --> 48:01.477
I thought you said that
everyone was onboard.

48:01.479 --> 48:03.946
- Initially, yes, yes they were.

48:03.948 --> 48:05.915
But after they thought
about it some more

48:05.917 --> 48:07.283
they just said no.

48:08.652 --> 48:12.154
I begged and pleaded
with them of course.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.925
- Okay.
- I'm very sorry.

48:17.127 --> 48:20.930
- We'll just figure out
something else then.

48:20.932 --> 48:21.932
Sorry guys.

48:29.006 --> 48:30.973
- She's never gonna
talk to me again.

48:30.975 --> 48:32.975
- Things fall through
all the time.

48:32.977 --> 48:34.377
- Yeah, I guess.

48:38.015 --> 48:40.349
What was I thinking
trying to set up a dance?

48:40.351 --> 48:41.651
- It could've worked.

48:41.653 --> 48:45.955
I could've pushed the
whole thing through.

48:45.957 --> 48:47.957
That was a really good
excuse, by the way, Jessup.

48:47.959 --> 48:50.593
You have real
leadership potential.

48:50.595 --> 48:52.662
- Really?
- I'm serious.

48:53.630 --> 48:55.965
You're great.
- You think I could beat

48:55.967 --> 48:59.068
somebody like Rick Miller.

48:59.070 --> 49:01.570
- I just wish you would've
come to me sooner.

49:01.572 --> 49:03.039
I started campaigning
when I was a freshman.

49:03.041 --> 49:07.076
It takes time to win
an election, Jessup.

49:07.078 --> 49:07.944
You know what I'm
just gonna call her.

49:07.946 --> 49:08.978
I gotta patch things up.

49:08.980 --> 49:10.680
Do you have a quarter?

49:13.984 --> 49:16.452
- Yep.
- Thanks, be right back.

49:22.059 --> 49:24.360
- Pretty good burritos huh?

49:26.029 --> 49:28.164
You guys go to Mount Vista?

49:28.166 --> 49:30.299
- Yeah why?
- Well so do I.

49:30.301 --> 49:34.003
I'm Jessup Jacobs,
nice to meet you guys.

49:41.044 --> 49:42.411
- She wasn't home.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.014
I think I'm just
gonna go over there.

49:45.016 --> 49:47.216
I'm better in person anyway.

49:59.129 --> 50:00.129
Hey. - Hi.

50:02.432 --> 50:05.401
- So I kind of
wanted to apologize

50:05.403 --> 50:07.169
for how the meeting
went the other day.

50:07.171 --> 50:09.305
- Oh thanks, I understand.

50:09.307 --> 50:11.040
- Yeah, the administration
just threw me

50:11.042 --> 50:13.175
for a total curve ball.

50:13.177 --> 50:15.745
You know how that goes. - Yeah.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.281
- So.
- Well I gotta get going.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.718
Thanks for stopping by though.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.021
- Oh, where you going?

50:25.023 --> 50:26.622
- I volunteer at
the deaf school.

50:26.624 --> 50:27.624
- Really?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.559
I love volunteering.

50:33.096 --> 50:35.231
Sure you wanna push that?

50:38.635 --> 50:41.070
See what happens, push it.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.374
Yes, yes.

50:47.110 --> 50:48.444
Three in a row.

50:52.282 --> 50:53.349
Let's play again.

50:53.351 --> 50:55.184
Wanna do another one?

50:56.053 --> 50:58.354
You wanna play round two?

50:58.356 --> 50:59.155
Go again?

50:59.157 --> 51:01.257
Okay let's rebuild it.

51:51.741 --> 51:52.641
This was really fun.

51:52.643 --> 51:54.443
- Yeah it was.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.245
I think those kids
really liked you.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.313
- You think?

51:58.115 --> 51:59.515
Oh well, thank you.

52:02.385 --> 52:05.588
So we should hang out
again some time.

52:05.590 --> 52:07.356
- Yeah.
- Alright.

52:08.692 --> 52:11.494
- Oh hey, do you
know how to ski?

52:16.166 --> 52:18.701
- What the dickens
is going on here?

52:18.703 --> 52:20.169
- Everything okay, Tim?

52:20.171 --> 52:22.204
- Oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

52:22.206 --> 52:23.806
- Were they working the
last time you used them?

52:23.808 --> 52:26.575
- Yeah, the boots
are my friend's.

52:26.577 --> 52:28.277
These are my uncle's.

52:28.279 --> 52:31.247
Both told me they
were working great.

52:33.216 --> 52:35.151
Hey is this supposed
to look like this?

52:35.153 --> 52:37.586
Cause this one looks like this.

52:38.922 --> 52:41.524
- Hey dad, it's gonna take a
little longer that we expected.

52:41.526 --> 52:43.926
So we'll just meet you
on the hill okay?

52:43.928 --> 52:45.227
Can I have a few dollars?

52:45.229 --> 52:46.729
- Yeah, what for?

52:47.731 --> 52:50.466
- Tim wants to tip the shop guy.

52:53.336 --> 52:54.336
Thanks dad.

52:55.338 --> 52:56.572
See you later.

53:03.513 --> 53:07.950
- Yeah it was creepy, he
was just staring at me.

53:07.952 --> 53:10.352
- That's a crazy story, man.

53:47.757 --> 53:49.358
- What's going on?

53:49.360 --> 53:51.260
- He's got a gun.

53:51.262 --> 53:52.494
- Hop on back.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.409
- Hey guys.

54:08.578 --> 54:11.547
- Tim, where have you been?

54:11.549 --> 54:13.382
I've been so worried.

54:13.384 --> 54:15.017
- I'll tell you about it later.

54:15.019 --> 54:17.386
- How's the powder?

54:17.388 --> 54:18.487
Chilly.

54:24.561 --> 54:25.828
It was a lot of fun today.

54:25.830 --> 54:27.329
- Yeah, it was.

54:30.367 --> 54:31.533
What's wrong?

54:33.403 --> 54:34.837
- He hates me.
- No.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.640
Hey Tim.

54:37.642 --> 54:41.443
I've been thinking, I
really, really wanna do

54:41.445 --> 54:42.711
this combined school dance.

54:42.713 --> 54:44.546
I just think it's
such a great idea.

54:44.548 --> 54:47.783
- Yeah, yeah, I really
wanna do it too.

54:47.785 --> 54:51.420
My advisors are just
so set in their ways.

54:51.422 --> 54:52.988
- Well what if I talked to them.

54:52.990 --> 54:55.324
- To my advisors?
- Yeah.

54:57.427 --> 55:00.429
- I don't think that's
such a good idea.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.530
- Why not?

55:08.438 --> 55:10.372
- Sydney, I think
there's something

55:10.374 --> 55:13.309
that I need to tell you. - What?

55:18.815 --> 55:23.485
- Actually, let me talk
to them one more time.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.454
- Okay, thanks everyone
for being here.

55:25.456 --> 55:27.423
First let's talk about our
plans for spirit week.

55:27.425 --> 55:31.026
- MacKenzie can I
bring something up?

55:31.028 --> 55:33.095
- Tim, you know the rules.

55:33.097 --> 55:34.963
- Yeah but I have something
really important

55:34.965 --> 55:36.632
that I need to say.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.602
- Fine, but after the meeting.

55:41.938 --> 55:45.874
- And in closing, think
about all the bridges

55:45.876 --> 55:47.476
we could build at Taft High,

55:47.478 --> 55:49.745
especially after the deer prank

55:49.747 --> 55:51.947
and all the homeless people
that we'll be saving.

55:56.419 --> 55:57.853
- Doesn't that sound great guys?

55:57.855 --> 55:59.822
- We already have plans
for our food drive.

55:59.824 --> 56:02.057
- What are they?
- What we always do.

56:02.059 --> 56:04.126
The faculty talent show.

56:04.928 --> 56:06.395
- Is anyone here really excited

56:06.397 --> 56:09.531
to see Miss Brown play
the french horn again?

56:09.533 --> 56:11.400
- We always do the talent show.

56:11.402 --> 56:15.537
And besides Taft's colors
clash with our colors.

56:15.539 --> 56:17.439
- Think about all the food
that we could be raising

56:17.441 --> 56:19.608
using competition
and we can announce

56:19.610 --> 56:21.510
the Hope of America finalists.

56:21.512 --> 56:25.381
I personally know Taft High's
SBP and she loves the idea.

56:25.383 --> 56:27.483
- Canned food at a
formal dance is tacky.

56:27.485 --> 56:29.485
- But it's for a good cause.

56:29.487 --> 56:32.020
- That's why we do the
faculty talent show.

56:36.693 --> 56:37.693
- Sorry.

56:40.096 --> 56:41.096
So how'd it go?

56:45.402 --> 56:47.069
- She didn't go for it.

56:47.071 --> 56:49.638
- Well what're you gonna do?

56:49.640 --> 56:52.174
- I don't know, I don't know.

56:52.176 --> 56:53.442
I guess I'm just,

56:53.444 --> 56:56.044
I'm gonna tell her. - Yeah?

56:56.046 --> 56:57.446
- Sydney has her heart
set on this thing,

56:57.448 --> 56:59.481
MacKenzie won't budge.

57:00.517 --> 57:01.583
- I'm sorry.

57:03.887 --> 57:06.121
I wanted to show you this.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.992
Just get a second opinion.

57:09.994 --> 57:11.560
What do you think?

57:13.596 --> 57:16.098
- Uh we'll work on
something better.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.666
Come on, let's go.

57:29.580 --> 57:30.679
- Oh jeez.

57:36.786 --> 57:37.786
Yes.

57:39.088 --> 57:41.023
- Mr. Wakefield?
- Yeah.

57:41.025 --> 57:42.491
- Can you please send

57:42.493 --> 57:45.461
Tim Timmerman to the office?
- Sure, Tim.

57:49.699 --> 57:50.866
- Hey Modine.

57:54.504 --> 57:56.505
- Well now that we're all here.

57:56.507 --> 57:57.840
I wanna thank you
all for coming.

57:57.842 --> 58:00.008
We really appreciate it.

58:00.010 --> 58:03.979
Everyone this is
Officer Roland Pratt.

58:03.981 --> 58:05.747
- Ronald.
- Ronald,

58:06.883 --> 58:07.883
- Platt, Ronald Platt.

58:07.885 --> 58:09.151
- Ronald Platt.

58:09.153 --> 58:11.987
He's a security guard
with Taft High School

58:11.989 --> 58:13.822
and the car that he
remembers that night

58:13.824 --> 58:15.891
resembles Brandon's car.

58:17.260 --> 58:20.629
Do you recognize anyone
from that night, officer?

58:20.631 --> 58:22.531
- You know it was a long
time ago, I don't remember

58:22.533 --> 58:24.166
everything perfectly.

58:25.268 --> 58:28.670
I do remember somebody
telling me a funny story

58:28.672 --> 58:30.572
and he looks familiar.

58:33.610 --> 58:36.211
- Tim, were you
there that night?

58:43.920 --> 58:46.154
- No, no Tim wasn't there.

58:48.591 --> 58:51.293
But the rest of us
were all there.

58:56.633 --> 58:59.635
- Mrs. Timmerman, Tim,
thank you for staying.

58:59.637 --> 59:00.869
I've asked Monica
to stay as well

59:00.871 --> 59:03.939
because this involves her too.

59:03.941 --> 59:08.176
You know, Monica has been
trying for a couple of weeks

59:10.113 --> 59:12.748
to get me to give Tim a pass.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.783
She's a big advocate of his.

59:14.785 --> 59:16.685
I pushed back and I pushed back

59:16.687 --> 59:20.122
because I wasn't convinced
that I could trust him.

59:20.124 --> 59:23.625
But Tim, I'm very impressed
with you lately.

59:23.627 --> 59:25.761
Your teachers tell me that
you're attending class

59:25.763 --> 59:27.763
on a much more regular basis.

59:27.765 --> 59:29.698
You've taken that Jessup
kid under your wing

59:29.700 --> 59:32.134
and I'm very impressed with
the initiative you've taken

59:32.136 --> 59:35.904
of coming up with ideas
for the winter formal.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.273
Quite frankly I'm just
depressed thinking

59:38.275 --> 59:39.808
about playing the banjo again

59:39.810 --> 59:42.978
at another faculty talent show.

59:42.980 --> 59:46.815
I've decided to drop the
impeachment hearing.

59:48.051 --> 59:49.851
I'm sticking my neck out on this

59:49.853 --> 59:52.187
so please don't
compromise my trust.

59:52.189 --> 59:53.288
- No sir, no way.

59:53.290 --> 59:55.357
Thank you so much Dr. V.

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:09.338
There she is.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.739
Let's get started with
the meeting everybody.

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:14.676
Jessup, go ahead and
kill the welcome music.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:25.287
I'm sorry, I think
you're in my seat.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.791
- Why can't you sit
somewhere else?

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:31.627
- Jessup.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.633
Okay guys can you do me
a favor and stand up?

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.006
Great, thanks.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:50.879
Be seated.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:01:00.255
- So where do you think
we should put the DJ?

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.859
I was thinking maybe
in the back corner.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.864
What are you doing?

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.102
- I need a break, I'm tired.

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:17.172
- We still have a
lot of work to do.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.286
- What do you have in here?

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.125
What is this?

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.062
- Book of Secrets, they're new.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.163
- You can hear this?

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:42.397
- A little.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.700
I can feel the vibrations.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.935
I like the lyrics.

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:48.003
- It's cool.

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.305
Do you have anything else?

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:52.708
Maybe some Pearl Jam?

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.876
This isn't really
my type of music.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:56.311
- I love this song.

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:01.817
- I guess it's pretty
good, if you're a girl.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.963
What? - I thought we were

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:17.432
supposed to do some planning.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:22.738
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.409
- Why did you run for
student body president?

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.978
- I don't know.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.749
I just thought it would
look good on my resume.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.150
- Look good?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:39.221
- Yeah, like for my
college application.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:43.058
- So you ran for president
for your resume.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.761
That sounds admirable.

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.096
- I don't know.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:52.367
Let me just put it this way,

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:55.971
when you're a Timmerman, you
have to have something.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:03:00.375
I don't know, I guess
I have politics.

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:02.043
- You wanna be a politician?

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:05.080
- Yeah, yeah, I
wanna go to Yale.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.918
- Then you should
talk to my dad.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.254
- Sure that's gonna
go over well.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:15.223
Probably have guys
trying to get favors

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:17.859
from your dad all the time.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:18.861
- No.
- No?

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.030
- Not really.

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.037
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.507
- Why did you run for president?

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:38.313
- Last year, it was the
furthest thing from my mind.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.083
I was just focused on
school and swim team

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.987
and then a friend of mine
said, Sydney I think

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:50.292
you'd make a really good
president and I don't know.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:54.529
I just, I thought about it
and all the good I could do

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:01.336
and it's the best
decision I ever made.

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:17.252
- Was that okay?

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:18.987
- Yeah, it was nice.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:26.194
It was my first kiss.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.196
- Really?

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:35.397
This looks really good.

01:05:35.399 --> 01:05:36.998
We've done well.

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:45.707
Jessup.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:46.709
- Hey Tim.

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.211
Ooh.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:54.482
Do you think people
will like it?

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:56.251
- I do.
- Right on.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.720
Oh shoot.

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:01.289
I've got some bad news.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.058
- What?
- I found out who's writing

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.192
Mackenzie's letter
of recommendation

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.528
for Hope of America. - Who?

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:10.231
- It's the CEO of WordPerfect.

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.302
- You sure it's the
CEO, it's not the VP?

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.971
- CEO.
- Aw fetch.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:22.377
- Do you have somebody
to write yours yet?

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.453
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:37.125
You look great. - Thank you.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.227
You look good too.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:40.261
I like your tie.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.063
- Aw thanks.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:45.166
This is my grandfather's tie.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.301
He passed on.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.071
I hope that doesn't
freak you out.

01:06:50.073 --> 01:06:52.707
- Oh I talked to my dad about
your career aspirations.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.310
- You did?
- He said he'd talk to you.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.244
- Oh thank you.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.545
That's awesome.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.216
Here, a mint.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:03.518
Well share it.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.121
- Okay.
- A little appetizer.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:14.429
- Thank you, Mitchell.
- You're very welcome.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:17.399
- So Tim, what are your
plans after high school?

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.601
- I would love to
become a lobbyist

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:22.137
and then maybe a senator.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.539
I'm trying to get into Yale.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:31.446
- Tim is applying for the Hope
of America scholarship, dad.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.114
- That's great, Tim.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:35.583
- Yeah, paging for
Senator Anderson

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:38.753
would be just an
amazing opportunity.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.059
These rolls are good, huh?

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:46.761
- Excuse me.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.334
- Excuse me.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.372
- He's cute.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.121
- How about those rolls?

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.189
Pretty good.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:18.560
- Sydney tells me you need a
letter of recommendation.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:19.694
- Yeah, I do.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:24.499
- To be honest, I don't feel
comfortable writing a letter

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:27.268
for someone that I don't know.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.305
That make sense?

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:35.609
- Yeah, yeah that
makes total sense.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.678
- Very good.

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.826
- Would you like
another roll, Tim?

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:54.261
- Yes, that'd be
great thank you.

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:55.863
Could you also pass the butter?

01:08:55.866 --> 01:08:57.698
- It's right in front of you.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:58.701
- Yes, yes.

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.313
- I'll be right back.

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.758
Go, go, go, go.

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:16.578
Hey thanks a lot.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.980
How much do I owe you? - 20.

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:23.418
- Hey do you have 20
bucks I can borrow?

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:30.491
- You mind telling me what
that charade was all about?

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.502
- Alright, it's a game
called assassins.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.239
Every year a couple hundred
kids from our school

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.441
put $5 into a pot,
everybody gets a name

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:48.409
and a toy pellet gun.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:50.378
This is my gun.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.647
The only rule is you can't shoot
anybody on school premises.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:53.748
But when you do shoot somebody,

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.384
you get the name that they had

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:59.554
and last person
standing wins the pot.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.496
- That is the greatest
high school activity

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.300
I have ever heard of.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:14.636
- Really?
- It takes strategy,

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:17.772
ingenuity, it's
good for bonding.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.340
How much is in the pot?

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:20.942
- A thousand bones.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.644
If I win, I'm gonna
buy a scooter.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:23.578
- I wish we had
something like that

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.513
when I was in high school.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:26.547
How many students are left?

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:27.849
- Three, I think.

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.717
- And who was that boy
in the restaurant?

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.487
- Ross Thompson,
wins every year.

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:35.356
- Do you think you
could beat him?

01:11:35.358 --> 01:11:36.457
- I don't know.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:37.825
He's kind of a legend.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.594
But before hand, I have
to beat Kyle Stratton

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:42.797
and whoever he's got but I
think he's got Toby Cranny.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.400
- What's Kyle's story?

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.503
- Hermit, never
leaves his house.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.571
- Let me see the pistol.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:58.780
Tim, how would you feel about
me tagging along with you?

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.929
- I'm Kyle Stratton.
- Oh great.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:43.558
- I'm looking for Toby Cranny.

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:50.932
- Hey Toby.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.438
- Did you see his face?

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.607
- Oh your TCBY idea
was brilliant.

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:00.641
- Thank you.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:03.544
How did you know that cop?

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.546
- It's a long story.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:09.150
- So what's our plan
to get Ross Thompson?

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:10.551
- You know what?

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:15.623
I think I gotta get
Ross Thompson myself.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:16.924
- I respect that.

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:20.595
When's your Hope of
America application due?

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:21.629
- Friday, why?

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:26.834
- That's good cause that'll
give me just enough time

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:30.671
to write you a letter
of recommendation.

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.452
- Was Tim involved with
you in the deer prank?

01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:45.686
- What are you talking about?

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:47.955
- Oh come on Brandon,
everybody knows.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:49.424
- I gotta get back to practice.

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:51.426
- Was he or was he not?

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.694
- I don't wanna talk about
it right now, okay?

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.729
I gotta go.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:08.843
- I've always admired
how fun you are.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:10.778
- Oh yeah?
- Always.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.449
- Well you know, I do my best.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:18.586
- Like I heard what you
guys did to Taft High

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.855
and I thought it was
so funny and cool.

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:24.625
- Yeah that was the
funniest and the coolest.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.195
- I can't believe you got
Tim to go along with you.

01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:30.731
- Go along, no that
was Tim's idea.

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:31.733
- No.
- Mm hmm

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.205
What? - It's just so funny.

01:14:37.207 --> 01:14:39.040
- Oh.
- Okay give me some more.

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:40.608
- Okay.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.710
- Alright smile big.

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:03.164
- Look at the floral
patterns and the taupe

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.533
and the sweet dude
with two dates.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:06.634
Rad, bro.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:09.203
Yeah okay, guy, yeah okay.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:10.204
Keep going.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:12.173
Did you guys see
that white suit?

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.241
Right crisp.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.911
- Aw man it's Brett and Tina.

01:15:16.913 --> 01:15:18.613
You guys look good.

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:20.147
Thanks for the cans.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:23.618
- Hey there mister.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.186
- Monica, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.121
- Really?
- Do you think you could fill

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.624
in for us for a little bit?

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.193
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.296
- Thanks, Monica.

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:45.806
- Okay, yeah, purple
dress and a white belt.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.785
- Are you nervous?

01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:59.587
- No.
- Yes you are.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.724
- Yeah I am, just a little bit.

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.095
You know what?

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.231
I got you something.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.233
- You did?

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:15.770
- Just this.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.973
You like it? - It's cute.

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.741
- Yeah?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.944
Can I put it on you? - Yeah.

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.927
- Hello everyone.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.049
Everyone having fun tonight?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.702
It has been a great dance
tonight, hasn't it?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:52.340
That we've set a record tonight
with the amount of cans

01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:54.709
raised for the homeless shelter.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.880
Okay now it's time to
announce the finalists

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:02.249
for the Hope of America award.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:07.154
For Mount Vista High School,

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:09.357
Robert Wood,

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:13.828
MacKenzie Miller,

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:17.898
and Tim Timmerman.

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:26.140
Both Brandon and Garrett
said he wasn't there.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:28.275
- That's not what
Garrett told me.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.711
- We've already dealt
with the issue.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:31.846
- It's not fair.

01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:34.215
- Look MacKenzie, I
know it was hard

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.751
losing to Tim in the election,

01:17:36.753 --> 01:17:39.387
but my advice to you
is to let it go.

01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:41.656
You'll be a lot happier.

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:49.030
- Tell me what
Garrett said again.

01:17:58.907 --> 01:17:59.907
Such a ham.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.945
It's so crazy that he's a
finalist for the Hope of America.

01:18:04.947 --> 01:18:05.946
- I know.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:07.882
I'm so proud of him.

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.016
- Yeah, same.

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.788
Yet none of us thought
he could do it.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.157
He's been on probation
for the last month.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:19.093
- Did you say probation?
- Yeah.

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:20.928
Oh you didn't know that?

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.731
- No.
- Yeah, for the deer prank.

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.901
Oh come on you had to
have heard about that.

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:30.271
- No.
- Yes, he talked our principal

01:18:30.273 --> 01:18:33.841
into reinstating him to
put on this whole dance.

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:34.942
- He did.

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.178
- You know Tim.

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.947
Tim just loves to weasel his way

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:42.850
to get people to
do what he wants.

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:44.852
Not that that's a bad thing.

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:46.887
- What do you mean?

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:50.291
- He probably sweet talked
someone into writing

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:54.061
that letter of recommendation
for Hope of America.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:55.063
Hats off.

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.169
- Excuse me.

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:07.975
- Sydney, check it out.

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.111
Someone tried to
donate cat food.

01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:12.113
- Is it true?
- What?

01:19:12.115 --> 01:19:14.115
- About the deer prank?

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.886
- Okay just let me explain.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.055
- Congratulations on the
Hope of America nomination.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.957
You got what you wanted.

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:24.158
- Got what?

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:25.259
- Ryan will you give
me a ride home.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.961
- Sydney.
- Don't talk to me.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:27.963
- Sydney.

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:37.138
- Tim, congratulations.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.906
- Did you say
something to Sydney?

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:41.108
- She's really upset
with me right now.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.978
- That's high school
girls for you.

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.948
- Nothing, we just had
a little girl talk.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.517
- Stop.
- What?

01:19:49.519 --> 01:19:51.051
- What did you say?

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:53.220
- I just told her
that how great it was

01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:55.556
that her dad wrote
the letter for you.

01:19:55.558 --> 01:19:59.026
I mean what, you didn't
want me to do that?

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.929
Isn't that why you're hanging
out with her, right?

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.531
- I can't believe this.

01:20:03.533 --> 01:20:06.300
- Oh come on, don't
be mad at me.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.335
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:10.871
Let's just talk about
this, figure things out.

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:14.141
- There is nothing
to talk about.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.343
- Oh right so this is
what you do for people

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.079
who bend over backwards for you?

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:24.318
- Tim baby, she's not there.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:28.856
- I've already left
five messages.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:30.357
You think six is too much?

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.326
- I'm not sure.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.028
I'm so sorry.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.163
- Well thanks, Charnelle.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.268
- Sweetie, he left
another message.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:47.141
You sure you don't wanna
just call him back?

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:49.143
Can you just tell
me what's going on?

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.111
- No, I'll be fine mom.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:52.213
It's okay.

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.419
- Hey man, congrats
on the nomination.

01:20:58.421 --> 01:20:59.887
You deserve it.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:08.929
- Let's start with
the first question.

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:10.431
Will you please
give us an example

01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:13.067
of a time you showed integrity?

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.085
- Again the swim meet
is this Saturday

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:35.289
and if you do not have your
IDs, you will have to pay.

01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.257
That's it for today-

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:38.592
- MacKenzie, wait a minute.

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.162
Tim, do you have anything?

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.434
- Yeah.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:09.089
Hi, this is Tim Timmerman,
your student body president.

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.993
I have something I
need to say today.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:17.231
It's very personal and it's
gonna be very difficult.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.435
Last year, when you guys elected
me to be your president

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:25.039
you were basically
saying, we trust you

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:29.243
to respect our honesty
and integrity.

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:30.644
I was supposed to
have lived my life

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:32.146
so that if a teacher
or administrator

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:33.714
would look at my
actions, they could say

01:22:33.716 --> 01:22:35.282
there is someone who
represents the greatness

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.251
of a rising generation.

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:41.155
I have not lived up
to those ideals.

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:43.457
I have done many selfish acts

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:46.994
with no regard to the impact
it would have on others

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:49.363
including those closest to me.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.269
I am responsible for the
vandalism at Taft High

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:57.271
and I take full responsibility.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.040
But that's not the only
thing that I have done.

01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:04.278
I have done many other things
that warrant impeachment.

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:10.150
So at this time, I'm
formally announcing

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:13.287
my resignation as
president and withdrawing

01:23:13.289 --> 01:23:16.123
from the Hope of
America running.

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:21.295
MacKenzie will now
be acting president.

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:26.200
She probably deserves it anyway.

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.217
Hey President Clinton.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.755
- Hey there.
- Hey.

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:23.357
- Proud of you today.
- Yeah?

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:26.393
- Took a lot of cojones.
- Thanks.

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:31.799
- Hey, look at it this way,
it could've been worse.

01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:34.268
Better to resign
than be impeached.

01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:35.469
- Yeah, I guess.

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:41.175
I just feel bad about Sydney.

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.678
- Girls.
- Any advice?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.415
- Just that time
heals all wounds.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.851
Time heals all wounds, alright.

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:52.386
Take care, Tim.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.822
- Take care, Bill.

01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:23.650
A very difficult decision with
two outstanding candidates.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.788
But we were able to
come to a consensus

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:30.791
so without any further ado.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:35.362
Winner of the 1994-95
Hope of America award

01:25:35.364 --> 01:25:36.497
is Robert Wood.

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.418
- I think it was my
letter of recommendation.

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.388
I got a Nobel prize winner
in economics to write it.

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:04.625
- Who was it?
- Jan Jorgenson from Stanford.

01:26:04.627 --> 01:26:06.527
- Hey Robert.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:09.229
Congratulations. - Thanks Tim.

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:12.566
Sorry you couldn't
be on stage with us.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:51.271
- So how are things
with you and Sydney?

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:52.873
- It's over.
- No way.

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.843
When does she move to DC?

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:58.512
- Today, I think.

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.215
- Bummer man.

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:03.917
- Yo, where you guys going?

01:27:03.919 --> 01:27:05.485
- El Azteca.

01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:06.587
- Nice, hop in.

01:27:07.989 --> 01:27:09.556
- I'm down.
- Cool.

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.298
- Let's get some freaking
tunes going, braj.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.900
- Sure, any requests?

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:21.335
- Pearl Jam.

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:22.836
- Pearl Jam it is.

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:25.672
Will you find my
disc man please?

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:32.446
Alright guys it's a no
go on the Pearl Jam.

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:35.415
How about a little radio?

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:38.852
- Ugh dude, change the station.

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:41.688
This is the crap my
sister listens to.

01:27:44.526 --> 01:27:46.493
- Wait Garrett, change of plans.

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:47.761
I need you to take me someplace.

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:48.996
- Like right now?

01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:50.564
- Right now.

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:53.967
Alright meet me back
here in an hour.

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:57.404
Oh wait, get me a
carne asada burrito.

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:00.540
- Our ride is here sweetie.

01:28:00.542 --> 01:28:01.508
Are you almost ready?

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:05.045
I have a couple more things.
- Okay.

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:11.518
- You guys are late.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.389
- Sorry braj, Rylie had another
bout with the nachos grande.

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:24.298
- Thank you, Dwayne.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.833
- Oh I forgot my sweater,
I'll be right back.

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:28.702
- Okay, sweetheart.

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.507
- Step on it.

01:28:33.509 --> 01:28:36.576
- I'm giving her all
she's got, Tim.

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:40.981
- You've gotta be kidding me.

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:43.483
- Tell him we're
in a hurry, braj.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:45.018
- Excuse me sir, we appreciate

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.787
that you're keeping all
the roads safe for us

01:28:46.789 --> 01:28:50.424
but we're sort of in an
emergency situation here.

01:28:50.426 --> 01:28:51.758
Yeah, cool thanks.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.527
- You want a bite?

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.600
- Sydney wait.

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.036
Sydney please.

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:39.005
Come on I need to
tell you something.

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:40.707
- Dwayne, I'm ready to go.

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:42.809
- I know you don't
wanna talk to me.

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:45.879
Okay, so I'm not
gonna say anything.

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:45.705
- What's this?

01:30:45.707 --> 01:30:47.507
- My acceptance
letter to U of U.

01:30:47.509 --> 01:30:49.776
- I thought you
wanted to go to Yale.

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:52.479
- I never had a chance.

01:30:52.481 --> 01:30:54.514
To be honest I
never had a chance

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:58.618
of getting into University
of Utah without you.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.954
You made me wanna be better.

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.691
I got in because of you.

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:37.991
- I thought this wasn't
your type of music.

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:42.929
- Tim!

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:57.203
- So Brandon, what do you
think you're gonna major in?

01:32:57.205 --> 01:32:58.605
- Probably mathematics.

01:32:58.607 --> 01:32:59.706
What about you?

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:01.875
- I'm thinking pre med.

01:33:01.877 --> 01:33:03.343
So Tim, has the U
of U made you think

01:33:03.345 --> 01:33:04.978
about anything other
than politics?

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.580
- Well I heard something
interesting the other day.

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:08.315
Apparently Bill Clinton
did not do his undergrad

01:33:08.317 --> 01:33:09.749
at an Ivy League school.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.251
He went to Georgetown.

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.787
Hey also there's no
assassins league here

01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:15.055
at the University of Utah.

01:33:15.057 --> 01:33:17.357
I think we gotta start one.

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:23.163
Will you hold these one second?

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:26.967
Hi. - Hi.

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.737
- Tim Timmerman,
freshman council.

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:20.020
- Is everybody
having fun tonight?

01:34:21.723 --> 01:34:22.989
I wanna welcome to the stage

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:25.125
the organizer of tonight's dance

01:34:25.127 --> 01:34:29.295
and our student body
president, Jessup Jacobs.

01:34:32.901 --> 01:34:34.300
- Hey everybody.

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.370
Let's get our groove on.
