WEBVTT

00:04.152 --> 00:08.111
Whoa. Close one. But, alas,
my friend, not close enough.

00:08.289 --> 00:09.779
Ha-ha-ha! Ouch.

00:09.958 --> 00:11.084
Sorry, buddy.

00:11.259 --> 00:13.091
Ah. You wanna go again?

00:13.261 --> 00:16.390
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay. It's your funeral.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.765
- Ah, by the way,
- Yeah?

00:19.934 --> 00:21.663
I'm hitting the club tonight.
You want in?

00:21.836 --> 00:22.894
For once?

00:23.071 --> 00:24.129
I don't know.

00:24.305 --> 00:27.070
- Come on. I'm celebrating.
- Celebrating what?

00:27.242 --> 00:28.801
You know I can't talk about it.

00:28.977 --> 00:30.172
Oh, yeah. Why not?

00:30.345 --> 00:32.006
Confidentiality agreements.

00:33.548 --> 00:36.882
Well, if I told you, then I would have
to kill you, which I just did!

00:37.051 --> 00:39.145
Oh, man.

00:42.824 --> 00:44.258
Someone's shooting at me!

00:44.425 --> 00:46.225
That's why it's called
a first-person shooter.

00:46.728 --> 00:48.924
No, this is not a game.
Please call the police.

00:49.097 --> 00:50.155
What?

00:50.331 --> 00:53.028
Ira? Hello?

00:56.137 --> 00:57.366
Erase. Erase.

01:13.922 --> 01:15.412
Hello?

01:16.124 --> 01:17.922
Hello?

01:18.493 --> 01:20.359
Ira, what's going on?

01:22.030 --> 01:23.293
Ira?

01:23.965 --> 01:25.694
Come on, is this a joke?

01:25.867 --> 01:28.131
Hey, Ira, are you okay?

01:32.173 --> 01:33.800
Ira?

02:00.768 --> 02:03.533
It's 8:00 in the morning.
You know where your partner is?

02:03.705 --> 02:04.945
I could ask you the same thing.

02:05.073 --> 02:06.097
Well, not really,

02:06.274 --> 02:08.874
because, technically, it's not 8:00
in the morning in Afghanistan.

02:09.009 --> 02:10.637
It's 8:30 p.m.

02:10.812 --> 02:12.473
So turns out,
I know where my partner is

02:12.647 --> 02:14.445
in both space and time.

02:14.616 --> 02:16.050
Deeks, G is fine.

02:16.217 --> 02:18.584
In fact,
I'd wager to say he's more than fine.

02:18.753 --> 02:21.017
What does that mean? Wait.

02:21.289 --> 02:22.848
Does that mean
what I think it means?

02:23.024 --> 02:25.118
G had a date with Joelle last night.

02:25.293 --> 02:27.352
Now he's late for work this morning.

02:27.528 --> 02:28.927
You get the picture.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.056
Oh, I get the picture.

02:31.232 --> 02:33.132
Downloading now.

02:33.301 --> 02:34.928
Delete. Delete.

02:35.103 --> 02:36.298
Save.

02:36.471 --> 02:37.700
Clear history.

02:40.108 --> 02:44.602
You know, I hate to say I was right,
but I was right.

02:44.779 --> 02:46.804
What? I thought it was Michelle
that set them up.

02:46.981 --> 02:48.710
- Where'd you hear that?
- Ahem.

02:48.883 --> 02:50.282
- Nell.
- Nell?

02:50.451 --> 02:51.714
What does Nell know about it?

02:51.886 --> 02:54.116
Nell knows everything
about everything mostly.

02:54.289 --> 02:56.451
Look,
Michelle submitted an endorsement.

02:56.624 --> 02:59.355
Anyone can endorse something,
but it takes a cunning strategist

02:59.527 --> 03:01.825
to put the pieces into play.

03:01.996 --> 03:05.728
Oh, you mean Hetty? Again,
this is all just coming from Nell.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.961
Heh. Okay, I admit, Hetty had a part.

03:09.137 --> 03:10.764
But it was a small part.

03:10.938 --> 03:14.897
- Miniscule.
- Small, Mr. Hanna?

03:15.710 --> 03:19.613
You ought to know by now
that I do nothing small.

03:20.415 --> 03:24.147
Ha. I haven't seen Mr. Callen yet
this morning. Is he all right?

03:25.186 --> 03:27.154
Yeah, he's fine.

03:27.322 --> 03:30.053
- He's more than fine.
- Hm.

03:30.224 --> 03:31.824
He had a bit of car trouble
this morning.

03:31.993 --> 03:33.620
He'll, uh, be in later.

03:33.795 --> 03:34.819
We got a case?

03:34.996 --> 03:37.966
Yes, yes.
Miss Jones will brief you up in Ops.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.225
Not you, however.

03:40.401 --> 03:42.426
You're needed elsewhere,
Mr. Deeks.

03:42.603 --> 03:44.037
Okay.

03:44.205 --> 03:47.045
The last time you said that, somebody
ended up in a different time zone.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.340
Sir?

03:54.515 --> 03:55.812
Over here.

03:57.952 --> 03:59.920
Got a sat phone.

04:01.456 --> 04:02.480
Don't touch it.

04:02.657 --> 04:05.649
- Keep searching this area.
- Yes, sir.

04:32.653 --> 04:34.178
Booker, we found Blye's phone.

04:34.355 --> 04:35.795
Looks like she ditched it purposely,

04:35.957 --> 04:37.755
maybe to let us know
where she was heading.

04:37.925 --> 04:39.017
Has anybody seen or heard

04:39.193 --> 04:40.718
- from Sabatino?
- No.

04:40.895 --> 04:43.193
- Well, keep looking, this sector.
- You got it.

05:21.135 --> 05:23.604
- Jack! Jack, it's Kensi. I'm here!
- What?

05:25.306 --> 05:26.501
No!

05:26.674 --> 05:28.267
Jack?

05:28.443 --> 05:29.467
Jack!

05:32.246 --> 05:36.444
Last night, a downtown loft
belonging to one Ira Wells

05:36.617 --> 05:38.585
was shot up by a sniper.

05:39.086 --> 05:40.110
Nell, where's Eric?

05:40.288 --> 05:43.053
L.A.P.D. found blood but no body.

05:43.224 --> 05:44.544
Okay. Where did Hetty send Deeks?

05:44.692 --> 05:46.717
Mr. Wells is a hacker for hire.

05:46.894 --> 05:49.158
- He specializes in...
- Earth to Nell.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.321
Where is everyone?

05:51.766 --> 05:54.098
Hetty sent Deeks to retrieve Eric.

05:54.268 --> 05:55.667
He's a witness in this case.

05:55.837 --> 05:59.239
- A witness how?
- Ira and Eric are college friends.

05:59.407 --> 06:02.433
They were chatting in an online game
last night when the attack occurred.

06:02.610 --> 06:05.409
- And how does this concern NCIS?
- Well, as I was saying,

06:05.580 --> 06:07.048
Ira is a hacker for hire.

06:07.215 --> 06:09.240
He specializes in finding zero days.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.476
You know, um,
code flaws in computer systems.

06:11.652 --> 06:14.178
So you think he was targeted
for something he was working on?

06:14.355 --> 06:15.754
Ira works a ton for the DOD.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.159
This could be a matter
of national security.

06:19.327 --> 06:22.319
Which is why we have
to find Ira ASAP.

06:22.697 --> 06:25.632
All right, G's pulling in. I'm gonna
brief him on the way to the loft,

06:25.800 --> 06:27.325
then I wanna talk to our witness.

06:40.348 --> 06:43.181
Hi. Hi. Excuse me. Um...

06:50.191 --> 06:52.125
Beale, your lawyer's here.

06:54.161 --> 06:56.220
- Oh, thank God.
- Ha-ha-ha.

06:56.397 --> 06:59.230
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait. Sorry.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.840
This is, uh... That's just too good.

07:00.935 --> 07:01.959
- Wait.
- Smile.

07:02.136 --> 07:04.104
- No. No.
- Wait. Ha-ha-ha.

07:04.272 --> 07:05.535
Let's go.

07:06.007 --> 07:09.375
So, uh, help me wrap my head
around this.

07:09.544 --> 07:12.536
You showed up to a crime scene,
alone, with no ID,

07:12.713 --> 07:15.683
wearing polar bear pajamas.

07:18.386 --> 07:21.026
Look, I don't know what happened.
Ira and I were playing this game,

07:21.188 --> 07:23.148
and suddenly I hear all this banging
and crashing.

07:23.291 --> 07:25.988
I'm like, "He's pranking me."
Then I'm like, "That sounds too real."

07:26.160 --> 07:28.629
I go to his place. Cops everywhere.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.676
- I'm trying to tell them what I heard.
- Right.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.560
This detective sets his coffee down

07:32.733 --> 07:35.794
right on top
of Ira's Cisco 5500-X Firewall,

07:35.970 --> 07:37.938
which is like using a Rembrandt
as a coaster.

07:38.105 --> 07:39.539
Totally.

07:39.707 --> 07:42.438
So long story short, I get arrested
for tampering with a crime scene.

07:42.610 --> 07:44.510
Mm-hm. Let me let you in
on a bit of advice.

07:44.679 --> 07:47.910
Don't mess with a cop's coffee.
You're lucky you didn't get shot.

07:48.649 --> 07:50.777
- Hey.
- Yeah?

07:50.952 --> 07:52.078
How mad is she?

07:52.253 --> 07:54.745
Scale of one to ten? Thirteen.

07:57.024 --> 07:58.048
Car trouble.

07:58.225 --> 07:59.522
- Really?
- Really.

07:59.694 --> 08:02.686
I just gave that excuse to Hetty.
Now you're gonna use it on me?

08:02.863 --> 08:05.628
It's not an excuse. Jo's car
wouldn't start, I drove her to work.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.064
I'm thinking her car trouble
was more car absence.

08:08.235 --> 08:10.226
Which means she was at your place
all night.

08:10.404 --> 08:11.564
What do you think about that?

08:11.706 --> 08:13.666
I think you've been married
a little bit too long,

08:13.808 --> 08:16.569
and you're trying to live vicariously
through me. That's what I think.

08:16.711 --> 08:20.113
All I'm saying is, you're welcome.

08:20.748 --> 08:22.045
Thank your wife for me.

08:22.216 --> 08:24.241
She was the mastermind.

08:27.521 --> 08:29.956
I'm starting to think Eric
made the wrong career move.

08:30.124 --> 08:31.888
Zero days are a lucrative business.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.890
Some sell for over a half a million.

08:36.364 --> 08:39.390
Something tells me Ira's not
gonna get paid for this one, though.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.467
I don't think so.

08:42.803 --> 08:43.895
All right.

08:44.772 --> 08:47.707
Sniper was positioned on the rooftop
over there.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.140
L.A.P.D. didn't find any brass.
Cameras either.

08:51.312 --> 08:53.747
Neighbor down the hall
called the cops,

08:53.914 --> 08:55.394
said she saw armed men
in the hallway.

08:55.549 --> 08:57.109
All right, so the sniper takes out Ira.

08:57.284 --> 09:00.151
Those guys come in,
pick up the zero day.

09:04.058 --> 09:05.526
We have fresh blood.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.364
You said L.A.P.D. cleared out.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.594
- Federal agents!
- Don't!

09:14.769 --> 09:17.602
Come down the steps. Careful.

09:19.373 --> 09:20.602
Put the bag down.

09:23.811 --> 09:25.370
Please don't shoot me.

09:25.546 --> 09:27.674
Relax, Ira. We're federal agents.

09:27.848 --> 09:30.545
So were the guys
who tried to kill me last night.

09:47.233 --> 09:48.530
Will I have a scar?

09:48.701 --> 09:50.191
I don't know. Do you want a scar?

09:50.369 --> 09:52.531
Could really up my game
with the ladies.

09:52.705 --> 09:54.935
Then you'll have one.
I'll make sure of it.

09:55.408 --> 09:58.742
Ira, our military
trains the best of the best.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.146
Which means
when we want someone dead,

10:01.314 --> 10:03.544
they're dead, yet here you are.

10:03.716 --> 10:05.150
Yeah, and how lucky for you,

10:05.318 --> 10:08.379
because you didn't get what you
wanted from my computers, did you?

10:08.588 --> 10:12.081
I wiped them clean and slipped away
in the dark.

10:12.258 --> 10:14.124
You slipped out in the night.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.557
But you still needed some cash
for the road, though, huh?

10:17.730 --> 10:18.754
Where were you thinking?

10:18.931 --> 10:20.695
Morocco?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.627
China?

10:23.236 --> 10:25.295
- Russia's nice too.
- Heh.

10:25.738 --> 10:28.867
Ira, I get it.

10:29.876 --> 10:31.742
You're scared.

10:32.445 --> 10:34.243
Somebody tried to kill you.

10:35.348 --> 10:37.840
But I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.485
Now, what does this zero day do?

10:42.288 --> 10:44.620
You're right, Agent Hanna.

10:44.924 --> 10:46.358
I am scared.

10:47.193 --> 10:49.287
But I'm not stupid.

10:49.462 --> 10:52.864
If I give up the zero day,
then you don't need me anymore.

10:53.032 --> 10:57.128
And this time,
I'm betting you won't miss.

11:02.108 --> 11:03.872
Guy has definitely got an ego.

11:04.043 --> 11:06.478
Heh. Guy thinks he's the center
of a government conspiracy.

11:06.646 --> 11:08.326
Where I come from,
we call that delusional.

11:08.481 --> 11:10.601
Well, in all fairness,
a sniper tried to take him out.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.275
Maybe he's not that far off base.

11:12.451 --> 11:14.091
Bottom line
is Ira doesn't trust us enough

11:14.253 --> 11:15.778
to tell us what the zero day is.

11:15.955 --> 11:17.980
All right,
so how do we get him to talk?

11:18.824 --> 11:21.316
The guy wants a conspiracy,

11:22.094 --> 11:23.858
let's give him one.

11:24.030 --> 11:27.056
Okay, Ira, what are you hiding?

11:31.571 --> 11:34.905
Looking through a few files here
and...

11:35.074 --> 11:37.042
Didn't mean to do that.

11:37.210 --> 11:40.373
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

11:40.546 --> 11:43.243
Aw, I'm sorry.

11:43.482 --> 11:44.745
What did Hetty say?

11:45.685 --> 11:46.811
Nothing.

11:46.986 --> 11:50.422
She just sat there and stared at me,
didn't say a word.

11:50.590 --> 11:52.888
I think I felt something die inside.

11:53.059 --> 11:54.720
It's probably just the prison food.

11:56.562 --> 11:59.725
While you were in the slammer,
I took a look at Ira's computers.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.833
Wiped clean, just like he said.

12:02.001 --> 12:04.201
Well, he's got state-of-the-art
data-shredding software.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.931
Whoever tried to kill Ira
couldn't have found the zero day.

12:07.106 --> 12:08.403
At least not yet.

12:08.574 --> 12:11.839
Bad news is,
we still have no idea what it is.

12:12.445 --> 12:14.174
Miss Jones, Mr. Beale,

12:14.347 --> 12:17.112
your presence is required
at the boatshed

12:17.283 --> 12:20.685
to assist in Mr. Wells' interrogation.

12:26.559 --> 12:27.856
You don't give up, do you?

12:28.027 --> 12:30.553
It's out of my hands.
I'm turning you over to the DOD.

12:30.730 --> 12:33.062
What? No.
I want my phone call, Agent Hanna.

12:33.232 --> 12:34.392
All right, I want my phone...

12:34.500 --> 12:36.264
I assure you,
you'll have your phone call

12:36.435 --> 12:39.063
just as soon as we can straighten
a few things out.

12:39.238 --> 12:41.639
Stephanie Prim, Department of...

12:41.807 --> 12:43.935
Oh, you're bleeding.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.771
This man needs a hospital,
Agent Hanna.

12:45.945 --> 12:47.879
It's just a flesh wound.
I dressed it myself.

12:48.047 --> 12:50.982
Oh, I didn't realize
you were a doctor as well.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.949
I'm done with you.
I'd like to speak with your superior.

12:57.290 --> 12:58.314
Now.

13:02.228 --> 13:03.423
And shut the door.

13:05.831 --> 13:08.425
That's right. Close it.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.364
Now...

13:13.673 --> 13:15.835
Actually, I'm okay, Miss Prim.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.442
Really, it's superficial.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.408
Just looks worse than it is.

13:19.578 --> 13:21.103
Well, you are a brave man.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.181
And I sincerely apologize
for your treatment thus far.

13:25.918 --> 13:28.546
Ah. Now...

13:30.089 --> 13:32.114
We believe you may be able
to help us

13:32.291 --> 13:33.850
with a matter of national security.

13:39.765 --> 13:41.597
Do you know this man?

13:44.770 --> 13:45.862
Yeah.

13:46.038 --> 13:48.666
That's Eric Beale.
I went to college with him. Why?

13:48.841 --> 13:52.471
We arrested Mr. Beale this morning
on charges of cyberterrorism.

13:52.645 --> 13:54.875
Uh, heh...

13:55.147 --> 13:58.811
- Beale? A terrorist?
- We have documentation showing

13:58.984 --> 14:00.824
he hacked a high-level
Pentagon e-mail address,

14:00.986 --> 14:03.387
which he then used
to enlist your services.

14:03.556 --> 14:05.854
We believe he was planning
to auction your zero day off

14:06.025 --> 14:07.356
to the highest bidder.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.489
This doesn't make any sense.

14:09.662 --> 14:11.824
I mean, why would Beale
hire someone

14:11.997 --> 14:13.477
when he could just do the job
himself?

14:13.933 --> 14:15.867
He's a skilled hacker.

14:16.035 --> 14:18.470
Clearly not as skilled as you.

14:18.637 --> 14:20.298
Ira.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.801
She's good.

14:27.413 --> 14:28.642
Scary good.

14:28.814 --> 14:33.615
Ira, we need to know exactly
what Mr. Beale asked you to find.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.518
Lives could be at stake.

15:04.717 --> 15:05.741
Jack?

15:09.655 --> 15:11.214
Jack.

15:16.862 --> 15:18.227
Hey.

15:19.198 --> 15:20.563
Open your eyes if you can hear me.

15:20.733 --> 15:22.258
- Jack.
- What?

15:22.435 --> 15:25.302
- Hi.
- Yeah. What...?

15:25.471 --> 15:28.031
I think they busted some ribs.

15:32.611 --> 15:34.079
What the hell are you doing here?

15:34.513 --> 15:35.912
I, uh...

15:36.081 --> 15:38.106
I came here to, um...

15:38.984 --> 15:40.918
What are you doing here?

15:41.086 --> 15:42.485
I heard you'd been captured.

15:42.655 --> 15:45.716
I was trying to talk them
into releasing you.

15:49.528 --> 15:51.053
I thought you were dead.

15:51.797 --> 15:53.629
Yeah, well, unh,

15:55.034 --> 15:58.436
I got a feeling we both might be
before the night's over.

16:00.806 --> 16:03.605
Ira's zero day exploits
a weakness in GLONASS,

16:03.776 --> 16:05.835
or Global Navigation
Satellite System.

16:06.011 --> 16:08.571
- Russian GPS.
- Yes.

16:09.782 --> 16:14.219
Uh, the flaw that Ira found
allows access to the base code

16:14.386 --> 16:17.686
that assigns coordinates to GLONASS
monitoring stations around the world.

16:17.857 --> 16:19.723
Meaning that a hacker
could trick the system

16:19.892 --> 16:21.951
into thinking Moscow
was in New Jersey.

16:22.127 --> 16:24.528
I'm guessing this is affecting
more than just Russian Yelpers

16:24.697 --> 16:26.187
looking for stroganoff?

16:26.365 --> 16:27.457
No. It is also the system

16:27.633 --> 16:29.897
- that guides their nuclear missiles.
- Ah.

16:30.069 --> 16:32.231
And if someone were to exploit
this zero day,

16:32.404 --> 16:34.044
they could potentially
divert the missiles

16:34.173 --> 16:35.732
to any target of their choosing.

16:35.908 --> 16:37.348
Makes sense
the Department of Defense

16:37.510 --> 16:39.877
would wanna take advantage of that
in the event of a war.

16:40.045 --> 16:42.104
Except the DOD didn't hire Ira.

16:42.281 --> 16:45.042
Hetty and I have been on the phone
with over a dozen senior officials.

16:45.184 --> 16:46.811
They've never heard
of this zero day.

16:48.587 --> 16:50.521
So, what does that mean?

16:50.689 --> 16:52.489
It means someone else
is trying to gain access

16:52.625 --> 16:54.855
to Russia's
missile guidance system.

17:04.868 --> 17:07.395
According to Ira,
the deal for the GLONASS zero day

17:07.570 --> 17:09.436
was set up
through Neidra Industries.

17:09.607 --> 17:12.008
Government contractor?
Thought their focus was cyber warfare.

17:12.175 --> 17:14.076
Well, that's essentially
what zero days are.

17:14.244 --> 17:17.875
So Neidra acts as the middleman
between the buyers and the hackers.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.017
It's become a profitable business
in recent years.

17:20.184 --> 17:23.415
So either someone approached
Neidra posing as the DOD...

17:23.587 --> 17:26.454
Or someone inside the company is
working for our mysterious third party.

17:26.624 --> 17:30.254
And unfortunately, Ira was bluffing
about wiping the zero day.

17:30.428 --> 17:33.295
Last night, he sent it to Neidra
through a secure router.

17:33.464 --> 17:35.159
So it should be sitting
on their server.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.853
If someone hasn't retrieved it
already.

17:37.001 --> 17:38.833
We need to get inside
and secure the zero day.

17:39.003 --> 17:40.801
Can't we just order them
to give us access?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.906
They are a government contractor.

17:43.074 --> 17:44.634
Too many laws
protecting corporate data.

17:44.775 --> 17:46.015
Legit approach could take days.

17:46.177 --> 17:48.817
- And it could spook the inside man.
- So we go in under the radar,

17:48.980 --> 17:51.074
access the server
without anyone knowing.

17:51.248 --> 17:52.977
Yeah, that's not gonna be easy.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.847
Neidra employs state-of-the-art
security measures

17:56.020 --> 17:58.887
around all of their servers,
so you won't get anywhere near them,

17:59.056 --> 18:01.081
let alone a computer
with access to them.

18:01.258 --> 18:03.226
Well, the company makes money
finding flaws.

18:03.394 --> 18:05.158
Makes sense they'd be flawless.

18:05.329 --> 18:07.525
Well, maybe we can use that
to our advantage.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.599
Look, Ira,
I'm sorry we had to lie to you.

18:12.770 --> 18:14.795
We just needed some answers fast.

18:14.972 --> 18:17.839
In retrospect,
I should have known it was a scam.

18:18.109 --> 18:19.406
I mean, you?

18:19.577 --> 18:20.703
A terrorist?

18:21.912 --> 18:24.074
But she had me going.

18:24.248 --> 18:26.512
Guess I'm just a sucker
for a pretty face.

18:28.919 --> 18:30.717
Look,
you know you can't trust them.

18:30.888 --> 18:32.378
The government.

18:32.556 --> 18:34.524
The people you work for.

18:34.692 --> 18:36.285
You're just a cog in their machine.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.622
- Ira...
- If you wanna have control,

18:38.796 --> 18:42.198
I mean, make a real difference
and some money too,

18:42.900 --> 18:44.527
work freelance with me.

18:46.670 --> 18:47.831
Are you serious?

18:48.005 --> 18:50.064
You know we would be a great team
again.

18:51.075 --> 18:52.543
Yeah, we would.

18:53.110 --> 18:56.080
But I make a big difference here
at NCIS.

18:58.115 --> 18:59.742
Do they know that?

19:06.190 --> 19:07.351
Here.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.657
Thank you.

19:17.034 --> 19:18.593
Who knows you're here?

19:19.403 --> 19:20.802
My unit knows I'm in Afghanistan,

19:20.971 --> 19:23.565
but nobody knows
I came looking for you.

19:23.741 --> 19:25.175
You shouldn't have.

19:27.945 --> 19:29.777
My mission was to kill you.

19:30.214 --> 19:31.238
Why?

19:31.415 --> 19:33.747
Because you've been helping
the militants.

19:33.918 --> 19:35.852
That's not true.

19:36.921 --> 19:37.945
S..

19:38.122 --> 19:40.716
So you're not the one they call
the White Ghost, Spin Pairay?

19:42.393 --> 19:44.953
The only ones I help
are the people from my village.

19:48.532 --> 19:50.899
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:51.869 --> 19:54.804
Your village, Jack?

19:54.972 --> 19:58.909
Who are you?
You've been gone for nine years.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.372
Something inside me broke
when I was here.

20:03.914 --> 20:06.154
You know we could've worked
through this together, right?

20:06.317 --> 20:07.785
You and me?
The way it used to be?

20:07.952 --> 20:09.647
- I tried. I tried.
- You didn't try hard.

20:09.820 --> 20:11.780
- We could've done this.
- Thought if I came here,

20:11.922 --> 20:13.822
I could find what I lost.

20:13.991 --> 20:19.623
And what I found was simplicity
and purity of existence.

20:19.797 --> 20:25.395
It was as if everything from my past
just fell away and I was free.

20:27.872 --> 20:29.806
Free from me.

20:30.474 --> 20:32.238
From everything.

20:34.778 --> 20:37.406
I'm not the man you remember.

20:39.950 --> 20:42.715
The man who said he loved me?

20:43.454 --> 20:46.287
Who asked me to marry him?

20:47.992 --> 20:49.391
That...

20:50.494 --> 20:52.189
That part of me is gone.

20:53.097 --> 20:56.089
I converted to Islam,

20:56.267 --> 20:59.965
was eventually accepted
by one of the more moderate tribes.

21:00.671 --> 21:02.662
For the first time in my life,

21:03.507 --> 21:06.738
even in a world ravaged by war,

21:06.911 --> 21:08.879
I found peace inside.

21:10.614 --> 21:11.638
And out.

21:14.351 --> 21:15.716
I fell in love.

21:18.255 --> 21:20.485
Her name was Mastanah.

21:21.292 --> 21:25.490
Eventually we married, had a child.

21:25.763 --> 21:27.492
Belourine.

21:31.602 --> 21:33.070
And your wife?

21:35.239 --> 21:37.139
She was...

21:37.575 --> 21:39.543
She was killed in a drone strike.

21:41.111 --> 21:43.102
I'm sorry.

21:43.581 --> 21:45.276
I alerted the U.S. authorities,

21:45.449 --> 21:47.577
and their response
was to send a CIA operative

21:47.751 --> 21:49.048
to try and recruit me.

21:50.854 --> 21:53.289
I only cooperated enough
to protect my tribe.

21:53.457 --> 21:58.122
I have no interest in revenge
or violence.

22:00.431 --> 22:02.422
Hey, there's one thing I learned.

22:04.568 --> 22:07.003
It's that no one wins a war.

22:17.281 --> 22:18.771
Hi. How can I help you?

22:19.383 --> 22:20.407
Dexter Hughes.

22:20.584 --> 22:23.417
I'm here to see your CEO,
Lance Witten.

22:24.221 --> 22:26.883
I'm sorry.
I'm not seeing an appointment here.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.650
Yeah.
That's because I didn't make one,

22:28.826 --> 22:30.191
but he's gonna wanna see me.

22:30.361 --> 22:33.126
Well, unfortunately,
Mr. Witten is in a meeting.

22:33.297 --> 22:34.628
Mm-hm. Pull him out.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.306
Tell Lance that if he doesn't
come see me right now,

22:37.434 --> 22:39.903
his company is gonna be gone
by the time his meeting's over.

22:40.070 --> 22:42.801
Oh, and if he needs
any more convincing,

22:42.973 --> 22:46.466
why don't you just show him this?

22:50.614 --> 22:52.139
Thanks.

22:55.419 --> 22:56.443
You know what to do?

22:56.954 --> 22:59.423
It's not rocket science.

23:02.059 --> 23:03.720
I'm waiting.

23:04.428 --> 23:06.453
Look at that. Huh?

23:19.777 --> 23:21.176
G, I'm in position.

23:21.345 --> 23:22.835
Copy that.

23:23.614 --> 23:25.173
This some sort of joke?

23:26.116 --> 23:27.311
On the contrary, Lance.

23:27.484 --> 23:29.452
This is your most important meeting
of the day.

23:30.087 --> 23:32.112
You think you can scare me
with a few numbers?

23:33.524 --> 23:35.014
No.

23:35.192 --> 23:37.126
Not just numbers, Lance.

23:37.294 --> 23:40.286
They're the, uh,
password to your e-mail,

23:40.464 --> 23:41.522
but you know that.

23:41.699 --> 23:44.760
From last month. Change it weekly.

23:45.069 --> 23:47.265
- What do you want?
- The same thing you want.

23:47.771 --> 23:50.968
To ensure the security and success
of Neidra Industries.

23:51.141 --> 23:53.542
All right, we got a thumb.
Sending it to you now, Sam.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.689
Good to go.

24:12.663 --> 24:13.926
Right.

24:14.098 --> 24:15.190
You got nothing.

24:15.366 --> 24:18.336
I'll tell you what, Lance.
Why don't I just show you?

24:26.210 --> 24:28.076
Okay, Sam, you have 25 seconds

24:28.245 --> 24:30.213
till the backup generators kick in.

24:32.649 --> 24:33.980
Well,

24:34.651 --> 24:37.586
seems I found a zero day
in your own security system.

24:38.522 --> 24:41.116
I would be willing to sell this to you.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.658
Or I could pop over
to one of your competitors,

24:43.827 --> 24:46.057
see if maybe they're interested.

24:47.698 --> 24:50.724
You think you're the first person
who's tried to scam this company?

24:50.901 --> 24:53.495
I bet you got somebody outside
tampering with the power box.

24:54.071 --> 24:55.937
Get security in here.

24:59.042 --> 25:01.511
- Sam, you've got...
- Fifteen seconds.

25:02.045 --> 25:04.343
My internal clock is perfect, Nell.

25:07.451 --> 25:09.545
Okay. Optical tap in place.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.846
Seven seconds. Get out.

25:13.857 --> 25:17.054
Three, two, one.

25:20.764 --> 25:22.323
Lasers, man.

25:22.499 --> 25:24.365
I hate freaking lasers.

25:30.874 --> 25:33.309
Fine, Lance. You don't believe me?

25:33.477 --> 25:35.206
Why don't you check your servers?

25:35.813 --> 25:37.406
My servers are fine.

25:37.581 --> 25:39.345
Get him out of here.

25:39.983 --> 25:41.951
Suit yourself.

25:42.152 --> 25:43.176
It's good.

25:43.353 --> 25:45.947
Witten took the bait.
He's accessing the servers now.

25:46.123 --> 25:49.718
And thanks to the optical tap
that Sam put in place,

25:49.893 --> 25:52.590
I am right behind him.

25:52.763 --> 25:56.165
Okay, searching for Ira's zero day.

25:56.333 --> 25:57.801
It was just downloaded this morning

25:57.968 --> 26:01.802
onto a USB drive by Jeffrey Taylor.

26:01.972 --> 26:04.304
And he works in client services.

26:04.475 --> 26:08.434
And get this. He's accumulated
over 100 grand in credit card debt.

26:10.147 --> 26:14.277
Uh, guys, Taylor just used his ID
to exit into a parking garage.

26:14.451 --> 26:17.421
Sam, Deeks, it's just to your west.

26:30.634 --> 26:32.693
There's at least three men
in that SUV.

26:32.870 --> 26:34.861
He's selling the GLONASS zero day.

26:35.038 --> 26:36.597
Goodbye, credit card debt.

26:38.809 --> 26:40.277
Yes.

26:41.778 --> 26:42.836
Federal agents!

26:57.094 --> 26:59.028
Go. Let's go!

27:01.331 --> 27:02.821
Moving.

27:15.412 --> 27:17.005
He's dead.

27:18.415 --> 27:19.849
Taylor too.

27:20.017 --> 27:21.712
Zero day USB?

27:25.088 --> 27:26.249
No dice.

27:40.102 --> 27:41.797
We found a record
of encrypted e-mails

27:41.971 --> 27:43.268
on Taylor's home computer.

27:43.439 --> 27:44.679
Still working on breaking them.

27:44.807 --> 27:47.105
He's taken a lot of business trips,
including Russia.

27:47.276 --> 27:48.869
Maybe that's where he found
his buyer,

27:49.044 --> 27:50.671
set up the deal for the zero day.

27:51.146 --> 27:52.375
It was a bad deal.

27:52.548 --> 27:54.573
First they try to avoid paying
by going after Ira,

27:54.750 --> 27:56.775
then they kill Taylor
to avoid paying him.

27:56.952 --> 27:59.032
So we're looking
for the world's cheapest terrorists?

27:59.188 --> 28:00.349
Survey says...

28:00.522 --> 28:02.012
Chechen separatists.

28:02.191 --> 28:03.920
Meet Ruman Taimiev.

28:04.093 --> 28:05.857
He entered this country
seven weeks ago

28:06.028 --> 28:07.325
along with these men.

28:07.496 --> 28:10.193
They have ties
to the Ichkerian Peacekeepers.

28:10.366 --> 28:14.064
And intel suggests the group's goal
is to force the Russian military

28:14.236 --> 28:15.533
to pull out of the Caucasus.

28:15.704 --> 28:18.139
Control GLONASS,
you control the Russian missiles.

28:18.307 --> 28:19.797
They'd have to meet their demands.

28:19.975 --> 28:21.465
I've been thinking.

28:21.643 --> 28:24.613
Zero days get their name from the fact
that once a flaw is discovered,

28:24.780 --> 28:27.715
the owner of the hacked system
has exactly zero days to fix it

28:27.883 --> 28:28.975
before it can be exploited.

28:29.151 --> 28:31.711
If we fix the zero day, the Chechens
won't have that opportunity.

28:31.887 --> 28:33.446
Ira knows GLONASS better
than I do.

28:33.622 --> 28:35.556
I can easily access it
from his computers.

28:35.724 --> 28:38.659
It's an excellent idea, Mr. Beale.

28:38.827 --> 28:42.559
Miss Jones can accompany Mr. Wells
to his loft.

28:42.731 --> 28:44.665
With all due respect,

28:44.833 --> 28:47.894
I have more experience
hacking foreign systems.

28:48.070 --> 28:50.300
That's true, he does. He should go.

28:50.472 --> 28:53.703
Mr. Beale can hack just as well
up in Ops.

28:53.876 --> 28:55.810
And you're the field agent.

28:56.245 --> 28:57.644
Right.

29:00.816 --> 29:03.649
If this doesn't work,
we still gotta warn the Russians.

29:03.886 --> 29:07.550
Sounds like it's time to pay our
old friend at the, uh, consulate a visit.

29:08.023 --> 29:10.117
- You think he'll remember us?
- Mm-hm.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.392
I'm guessing
you don't really wear glasses.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.365
No.

29:27.409 --> 29:30.538
But the attitude, was that real?

29:31.213 --> 29:32.772
What do you think?

29:32.948 --> 29:35.076
Uh, guys, we're on a clock.

29:36.752 --> 29:38.277
Right.

29:39.154 --> 29:41.851
System is up and running.

29:42.024 --> 29:44.425
Okay. I'll get you access.

29:46.028 --> 29:50.431
I am loading
the bad GLONASS drive.

29:50.599 --> 29:51.930
Me too.

29:52.101 --> 29:53.762
Just take a minute.

29:53.936 --> 29:55.631
I was gonna say 15 seconds.

29:56.939 --> 30:00.204
Anyway, I'm glad about the glasses.

30:01.076 --> 30:02.908
Makes it easier
to see your brown eyes.

30:07.883 --> 30:10.443
Okay. I'm in.

30:10.986 --> 30:12.215
Soam I.

30:12.387 --> 30:15.618
- How long will it take to fix?
- Should go faster with two of us.

30:15.791 --> 30:17.911
Can you shore up
the PZ-90 coordinate datum while I...

30:21.096 --> 30:24.066
- What's wrong?
- The zero day, it's gone.

30:24.233 --> 30:26.065
The flaw's been fixed.

30:26.235 --> 30:28.499
- Isn't that what we wanted?
- No. We're too late.

30:28.670 --> 30:30.798
The Chechens have already accessed
the GLONASS.

30:30.973 --> 30:33.499
They've gone in and locked the door
behind them.

30:47.456 --> 30:50.619
- Will your tribe come get you?
- No.

30:50.792 --> 30:53.727
Yeah, well, mine will eventually.

30:53.896 --> 30:57.526
We might stand a chance
if we actually get ourselves free.

30:57.699 --> 31:00.100
- I've renounced violence.
- Really?

31:00.269 --> 31:01.862
Even if it means saving
your own life?

31:07.042 --> 31:09.636
Haven't you ever heard, God helps
those who help themselves?

31:10.913 --> 31:12.142
The Koran says:

31:12.314 --> 31:14.681
"Indeed, Allah will not change
the condition of a people

31:14.850 --> 31:17.319
until they change
what is in themselves.”

31:17.486 --> 31:18.954
Well, there you go.

31:19.121 --> 31:21.522
Now, let's change our condition
and get the hell out of here.

31:22.224 --> 31:23.953
What do you have in mind?

31:27.696 --> 31:29.391
Take off your clothes.

31:31.833 --> 31:33.232
And throw it in the fire

31:34.236 --> 31:36.316
with anything else we can use
to smoke up this place.

31:36.471 --> 31:39.497
When they come, it might give us
the few seconds we need. Come on.

31:44.279 --> 31:45.747
Where are you taking him?

31:45.914 --> 31:48.008
Jack? Jack!

31:48.850 --> 31:50.340
Where are you taking him?

31:51.653 --> 31:53.747
Where are you taking him?

32:21.016 --> 32:23.246
Little afternoon delight, Boris?

32:23.418 --> 32:24.943
Wife's not gonna like that.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.315
Who are you?

32:26.488 --> 32:27.887
And where are my men?

32:28.056 --> 32:29.820
Dealing with a little car trouble
downstairs.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.154
I'm surprised
you're not in Siberia, Boris.

32:32.327 --> 32:36.423
I mean, given the debacle
at the consulate last October.

32:36.598 --> 32:38.896
What do you know about October?

32:39.067 --> 32:41.263
- Tenth month of the year.
- Halloween, Columbus Day.

32:41.937 --> 32:44.304
But we're here to talk
about the Ichkerian Peacekeepers.

32:44.473 --> 32:46.237
You might wanna know
that earlier today,

32:46.408 --> 32:49.469
they gained access to your
Global Navigation Satellite System.

32:50.012 --> 32:51.411
GLONASS?

32:51.580 --> 32:52.741
Impossible.

32:53.682 --> 32:54.808
Call the Kremlin.

32:54.983 --> 32:56.781
No harm in checking, right?

32:58.120 --> 32:59.588
This is a trick.

32:59.755 --> 33:02.747
A ploy to get us
to scrap the test, huh?

33:02.924 --> 33:04.824
It will not work.

33:05.327 --> 33:06.453
Test?

33:07.129 --> 33:08.961
What test?

33:09.264 --> 33:13.201
You see, the Cold War never ended,
my dear American friends.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.769
But that was our mistake,
these past 20 years.

33:15.937 --> 33:19.498
Starting today, that all changes.

33:20.142 --> 33:22.236
Good day, gentlemen.

33:33.288 --> 33:34.585
We confirmed with the Pentagon.

33:34.756 --> 33:37.589
The Russians have been developing
a new long-range missile.

33:37.759 --> 33:40.091
A test launch is scheduled
for sometime tomorrow.

33:40.262 --> 33:43.357
- Which is already today in Russia.
- God, I hate time zones.

33:43.532 --> 33:44.863
Does the Kremlin know?

33:45.033 --> 33:47.113
Hetty and the White House
are on the phone with them.

33:47.269 --> 33:48.634
Correction. Was on the phone.

33:48.804 --> 33:51.136
The Russian president
Just informed us.

33:51.306 --> 33:53.798
The missile launched
five minutes ago.

33:54.376 --> 33:56.470
We were too late.

34:07.321 --> 34:09.847
According to the Russian
military, the missile was supposed

34:10.023 --> 34:12.014
to detonate harmlessly
in the Arctic Ocean.

34:12.192 --> 34:14.192
But with the way the Chechens
have altered GLONASS,

34:14.360 --> 34:17.353
it will now strike San Francisco
in 31 minutes.

34:17.531 --> 34:19.130
So the Chechens aren't aiming
for Russia.

34:19.299 --> 34:20.391
They're targeting the U.S.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.661
Their stated goal
is to get the Russian military

34:22.835 --> 34:23.893
out of the Caucasus.

34:24.071 --> 34:27.132
If U.S. declares war on Russia,
mission accomplished.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.799
- Is the missile nuclear?
- No, but it is carrying

34:29.976 --> 34:32.378
over 900 pounds
of fuel-air explosive.

34:32.545 --> 34:35.641
Thermobaric. Turns air to fire.

34:36.216 --> 34:37.656
Can't we send a command
self-destruct

34:37.818 --> 34:39.217
- to the missile?
- There isn't one.

34:39.353 --> 34:40.632
It's designed to be tamperproof.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.585
That includes
radio-controlled commands.

34:42.755 --> 34:45.350
Only way the missile will self-destruct
is if it goes off course.

34:45.525 --> 34:47.426
From the missiles point of view,
it's on target.

34:47.594 --> 34:51.792
The president just activated
the Aegis Missile Defense System.

34:51.965 --> 34:55.697
Unfortunately,
the only BMD capable vessels

34:55.869 --> 34:57.394
are in the Sea of Japan,

34:57.571 --> 34:59.300
watching North Korea.

34:59.473 --> 35:02.306
They're not in position
to intercept a missile from Siberia.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.956
If we can't use the zero day
to change the GLONASS coordinates,

35:05.112 --> 35:06.773
what else can we do?

35:08.782 --> 35:09.908
I think I have an idea.

35:10.751 --> 35:13.721
All GeoNAV Satellite Systems
rely on ground monitoring stations

35:13.887 --> 35:14.911
to provide coordinates.

35:15.088 --> 35:17.557
They're like guideposts
for the satellites.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.421
Now, if we can add a new station
to the GLONASS network,

35:20.594 --> 35:22.084
it might just skew the coordinates

35:22.262 --> 35:24.162
enough to alter the trajectory
of the missile.

35:24.731 --> 35:25.755
Great. How do we do that?

35:25.933 --> 35:29.164
We'd have to recalibrate
an American GPS station

35:29.336 --> 35:31.430
so that it thinks
that it's part of GLONASS.

35:32.039 --> 35:33.438
Okay, the nearest station

35:33.607 --> 35:36.941
is on a roof at Fifth and Rose,
downtown.

35:37.678 --> 35:39.009
Mr. Beale.

35:39.179 --> 35:42.308
Try not to get arrested this time.

35:44.384 --> 35:46.182
All right, I'm on my way.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.843
I gotta go back to Ops.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.045
Is everything all right?

35:49.223 --> 35:50.782
The Russians launched
a test missile.

35:50.958 --> 35:52.478
Eric and the others
are headed downtown

35:52.626 --> 35:55.721
to a GPS monitoring station
to try to recalibrate it.

35:56.196 --> 35:58.927
No one knows the ins and outs
of GLONASS better than I do.

35:59.099 --> 36:01.466
- I can help.
- Sorry, you're still a potential target.

36:01.635 --> 36:03.034
Just wait here.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.264
Another NCIS agent should be here
shortly.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.173
How much time?

36:15.349 --> 36:17.215
- Five minutes.
- Four-fifty-seven.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.945
Three seconds off. Someone needs
to wind their internal clock.

36:23.523 --> 36:25.013
I understand.

36:25.192 --> 36:27.661
Yes, she's just arriving.

36:28.262 --> 36:30.230
That was Agent Thompson
at the loft.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.523
Mr. Wells is gone.

36:32.266 --> 36:34.758
All right,
I'm pinging his cell phone now.

36:35.369 --> 36:37.838
That's the location
of the monitor station.

36:38.772 --> 36:40.035
Oh, no.

36:40.674 --> 36:41.766
Bugger.

36:41.942 --> 36:43.171
Mr. Callen.

36:43.343 --> 36:45.869
You're about to have
some company.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.776
Whoa! It's just me.

36:50.284 --> 36:53.743
- Yeah, he just got here.
- No, not Ira. The Chechens.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.946
They must have been watching
his loft.

36:56.123 --> 36:57.921
They're following him
to your exact position

36:58.091 --> 36:59.291
and heading up the stairs now.

36:59.459 --> 37:01.223
They figured Ira was with us
after Neidra.

37:01.395 --> 37:03.555
- Go help Beale.
- We need to buy Eric some extra time.

37:03.697 --> 37:04.721
Deeks, brace the door.

37:04.898 --> 37:06.229
On it.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.880
All right, buddy, first we need to...

37:08.001 --> 37:09.526
Adjust the L1 band
to 1602 megahertz.

37:09.703 --> 37:10.727
I'm already doing it.

37:10.904 --> 37:14.272
You compensate for the lower satellite
orbits. Do it in under three minutes.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.535
Okay. Anything else?

37:16.710 --> 37:19.077
Yeah. Nell's eyes?

37:19.246 --> 37:20.475
They're hazel.

37:30.190 --> 37:31.715
QRF is ten minutes out.

37:31.892 --> 37:33.792
We haven't got that long.

37:41.768 --> 37:43.099
You think that's them?

37:44.671 --> 37:45.951
Eric, how much time do you need?

37:49.176 --> 37:50.974
Sniper. North building.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.943
He doesn't have a line of sight
to the monitor station.

37:54.114 --> 37:55.309
Yeah, but these guys do.

38:03.290 --> 38:04.758
Eric, you're exposed.

38:04.925 --> 38:09.260
We're working. Ira, I need those
orbital calculations. Ira.

38:17.938 --> 38:19.133
Deeks, need a diversion.

38:19.306 --> 38:20.671
Hell, diversion's my middle name.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.170
Okay. Here goes nothing.

38:32.052 --> 38:35.044
On three. One, two...

38:44.898 --> 38:46.297
Ha, ha, ha. Hoo!

38:48.235 --> 38:49.532
All clear.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.035
- Deeks?
- Yeah, I'm good.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.071
But I'm definitely changing
my middle name.

38:57.477 --> 38:58.911
Eric.

39:05.185 --> 39:06.380
Eric?

39:06.553 --> 39:07.918
Is it over?

39:08.088 --> 39:10.147
Heh. It's over.

39:10.323 --> 39:11.813
What about the missile?

39:13.193 --> 39:15.059
Splashing down in the Pacific.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.822
Good work, Mr. Beale.

39:17.998 --> 39:21.195
So about us working together...

39:23.370 --> 39:24.838
I think I'm good where I am.

39:29.476 --> 39:31.103
- Yeah.
- You okay?

39:31.278 --> 39:34.111
- Yeah, legs just a little wobbly.
- Little wobbly.

39:34.281 --> 39:36.579
And I'm having trouble breathing.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.670
- This is shock. I'm in shock.
- You're in shock.

39:38.819 --> 39:41.845
- Yeah, I think I'm in shock.
- Brown bag, ice, elevate. Cocktail.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.222
The official statement
from the Russians

39:49.396 --> 39:52.923
is the missile functioned perfectly.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.431
And it did.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.366
Yeah, as long as those missiles
keep landing in the ocean,

39:57.537 --> 39:58.902
I'm a happy camper.

39:59.072 --> 40:00.403
Amen.

40:00.841 --> 40:03.208
Mr. Callen's already left?

40:03.710 --> 40:06.702
Yeah, he left to get his car
from the shop.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.109
- Shop.
- Oh, right.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.908
You mean Joelle's car?

40:14.988 --> 40:17.389
- Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

40:17.891 --> 40:20.519
Seven o'clock in the evening.
You know where your partner is?

40:20.694 --> 40:22.924
Nope, but I know who he's with,

40:23.096 --> 40:24.825
and I have a good idea
what they're doing.

40:24.998 --> 40:27.968
- You get the picture.
- Downloading, downloading.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.432
- Delete.
- Save.

40:35.775 --> 40:37.573
That was quite the day, huh?

40:39.679 --> 40:41.477
How you feeling?

40:41.915 --> 40:44.577
- Better. Tired.
- Mm.

40:45.118 --> 40:46.745
- A little queasy.
- Yup.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.283
It's probably still the prison food.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.418
Hey.

40:54.594 --> 40:57.495
- What?
- Just gonna say that

40:58.331 --> 41:01.631
it's nice to see your eyes
without your glasses on.

41:04.804 --> 41:06.533
Have a good night.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.598
You too. Have a good night.

41:09.142 --> 41:10.735
Thank you.

41:48.481 --> 41:50.711
Time for your breakfast, Owen?

41:50.884 --> 41:53.251
We have a situation. Blye's missing.

41:54.287 --> 41:55.311
What do you mean?

41:55.488 --> 41:57.217
I mean she's gone.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.415
She took a horse and left her rifle.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.828
I gave her a secure sat phone.

42:02.996 --> 42:04.088
She ditched it.

42:04.264 --> 42:07.256
She had a shot at our target
yesterday and she choked.

42:07.434 --> 42:09.732
No, my people don't choke.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.928
Then what is this?
Something spooked her.

42:12.105 --> 42:14.938
She missed the shot yesterday
and snuck out of here during the night

42:15.108 --> 42:16.132
without a weapon

42:16.309 --> 42:18.937
and without telling anyone else
where she was going.

42:19.112 --> 42:21.945
What about your man, Sabatino?

42:22.549 --> 42:24.142
I don't know.

42:24.317 --> 42:25.917
He works off the grid
for days at a time.

42:26.753 --> 42:31.122
So you actually
have two operatives missing.

42:31.591 --> 42:32.956
I'd be careful if I were you.

42:33.126 --> 42:36.096
She was your choice
for this mission.

42:36.263 --> 42:37.783
I tracked her horse as far as I could.

42:37.931 --> 42:40.901
She's heading into an area
controlled by the insurgents.

42:44.604 --> 42:47.869
Do you know something I don't know,
Henrietta?

42:48.508 --> 42:51.307
Because if you want your girl back,

42:51.811 --> 42:54.371
now would be the time to tell me.
