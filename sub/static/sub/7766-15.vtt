00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- I was just completely
disrespectful.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
- I really,
really supported you.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.999
I wish I hadn't.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
- Like, I don't have
my own place right now.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.999
- Obviously,
you can stay here.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- Okay.

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
- Another text message
from...

00:26.999 --> 00:27.999
Stassi Schroeder.

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
- Ever since Stassi's
been out of Katie's life,

00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
I think I've liked Katie
a lot more.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
- You look like
a goddess right now.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
- Pucker & Pout
is a blog that I started.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.999
Do what I've been doing
every day,

00:37.999 --> 00:39.999
but share it with the world.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.999
- You're so annoying.
- No, you're just a tease, babe.

00:41.999 --> 00:42.999
- James.
- Oh, whatever, dude.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
I'm done playing
games with you, babe.

00:44.999 --> 00:48.999
- The detective said
that bail was around $11,000.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
- Jax has to get arrested.

00:50.999 --> 00:53.999
- I'm suspending you
for a couple of weeks.

00:53.999 --> 00:54.999
You're either a liar,

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
you're a drunk,
or you're a thief.

Thank--Oh, my God, thank you!

01:36.999 --> 01:37.999
I forgot about this jumpsuit.

01:37.999 --> 01:40.999
I'm so excited.
Thank you.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
- So this is it...

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
- Yeah.

01:43.999 --> 01:46.999
- What has--
what has this been like?

01:46.999 --> 01:48.999
- Honestly, she's like
the easiest roommate ever.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.999
Homegirl is never home.

01:50.999 --> 01:52.999
When she does come home,
it's at 6:00 in the morning,

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
and she cleans.

01:54.999 --> 01:55.999
- She cleans your things?

01:55.999 --> 01:56.999
Like she'll clean
all of this?

01:56.999 --> 01:58.999
- She would
if I left it there.

01:58.999 --> 01:59.999
And she's single,

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
so, like, all she wants to do
is have fun and drink.

02:01.999 --> 02:02.999
I feel like
I have my own apartment,

02:02.999 --> 02:05.999
and Kristen's kind of like
the drunk maid

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
that comes in at 5:00 a.m.

02:07.999 --> 02:10.999
All in all,
this is a good situation.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.999
- How did your talk
go with Lisa?

02:12.999 --> 02:14.999
- Um...it was
the worst ever.

02:14.999 --> 02:17.999
I never want to experience
a day like that ever again.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.000
It was just her just
sh***ing on me.

02:20.999 --> 02:21.999
You hate me, Lisa.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.999
- You're not important
enough to hate--sit down.

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
- I had to swallow
every ounce of pride.

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
Anything I wanted to say,

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
I just, like, had to, like,
bury it deep in my ass.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.999
You know what I mean?

02:31.999 --> 02:33.000
I tried really hard
to take the high--

02:33.999 --> 02:35.000
I did take the high road.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.999
The high road sucks.

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
- I don't recommend it.

02:38.999 --> 02:41.000
I'd rather give birth
to a dump truck

02:41.000 --> 02:42.999
than have that conversation
with Lisa again.

02:42.999 --> 02:44.999
- So I talked to Katie.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.999
- You did.
- Yeah.

02:46.999 --> 02:48.999
I don't really know
what the best angle is,

02:48.999 --> 02:51.999
because she's not...
she's not happy still.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.000
- Jesus Christ!

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
Everyone, like, calm down!

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
I didn't kill anyone!

02:56.999 --> 02:59.999
All I ever did was tell
a few people to f*** off.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
There's so many more
worse people than me.

03:01.999 --> 03:06.999
There are people putting
blades in candy on Halloween.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
There are people running
sprinklers in the drought

03:08.999 --> 03:11.999
and even people
stealing sunglasses.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
- I feel like you should
reach out to people,

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
like, loved ones; like, people
that are close to her.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
- I'm scared of everyone.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.999
Oh, sh**.

03:31.999 --> 03:32.999
- Come in.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
- Hi!
- Howdy.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.999
I'm making lists!

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
- Okay.
Of things left to do.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- I might need to kind of
delegate a little bit.

03:40.999 --> 03:41.999
- Yeah, of course.

03:41.999 --> 03:42.999
- I think it's gonna be
really exciting.

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
I mean, I have
never done a party like this

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999
for anything before...
- Yeah.

03:46.999 --> 03:48.999
- And I've never done anything
like Pucker & Pout before.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
But I'm really proud of it,

03:50.999 --> 03:51.999
so now I feel like
it's the right time

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
to have its, like,
big launch party.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
- Yeah!

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
- Pucker & Pout
is a fashion blog,

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
and the purpose
of this launch party

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
is to gain exposure.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
It feels so official and so...
- I know!

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- Like, real, you know?
- Yeah.

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
- You can't take it
to the next level

04:06.999 --> 04:10.999
if advertisers and brand reps
don't know you exist.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
Hey!

04:12.999 --> 04:13.999
- Hi!
- Hey, you guys.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.000
- So I really want to involve

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
some of the brands
that we worked before.

04:17.999 --> 04:18.999
You know,
just some, like, people

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
on the professional business
end of things,

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
other bloggers,

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
Vine people.
- Oh, cool.

04:23.999 --> 04:24.999
- Just some of
the people that are,

04:24.999 --> 04:25.999
like, social media influencing,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
'cause I think this party
is gonna get Pucker & Pout

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
a lot more traffic to it.

04:30.999 --> 04:31.999
- I'm sure you invited
Kristen--

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
- I did invite Kristen
and Rachel

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
so Kristen doesn't
have to come alone.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.999
- Okay. That's smart.

04:37.999 --> 04:40.999
- Kristen knows enough
that how I feel about Stassi

04:40.999 --> 04:43.999
to not bring her.
- You would think.

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
- I feel like whether
it's the Pucker & Pout party

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
or your engagement party,
Stassi's crashing one of them.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
- Definitely not
the engagement party.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.999
- I am so excited to help Katie
plan for these big events,

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
especially
her engagement party.

04:54.999 --> 04:57.999
If I have to hire
a security team, I'll do it.

04:57.999 --> 04:59.999
- She hasn't been around,

04:59.999 --> 05:01.999
and I've been totally
okay with that.

05:01.999 --> 05:02.999
Like, I closed that door...
- Your life's great.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
and let the friendship go--
I've been really happy.

05:04.999 --> 05:06.999
We just got engaged,
like this Pucker & Pout--

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
Like, there's a lot of huge
things going on.

05:08.999 --> 05:11.999
- Yes. She's doing it now--
when she needs something,

05:11.999 --> 05:12.999
she wants to be your friend.

05:12.999 --> 05:15.999
The end of that friendship
caused Katie so much pain,

05:15.999 --> 05:18.000
Katie was devastated
for, like, weeks.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.999
I haven't seen her in a year.

05:19.999 --> 05:22.999
I don't really want her
coming back around.

05:23.999 --> 05:26.999
- ♪ Pick me up, shake me off ♪
- ♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

05:26.999 --> 05:29.000

just make it loud ♪

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Oh, finally--finally now.
- We're here.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.999
So I show up on time,
but you guys can't?

05:36.999 --> 05:37.999
- We're here, though.

05:37.999 --> 05:38.999
We got here.
- Ready.

05:38.999 --> 05:39.999
- All right,
kiss your mother as well.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
Even with those
dodgy teeth.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
- What happened to Max?
- He was feeling

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
really light-headed,
fainted,

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
hit a TV and a piece of wood...

05:47.999 --> 05:48.999
All of his teeth
are f***ed up.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.999
- I'm the only person that
wants to kiss you right now.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.999
- I know.
- Make the most of it.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.000
- Not necessarily true.
- Oh, God, okay.

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
I hope you haven't been kissing
anybody, seriously, with that.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
- He was kissing someone
all night last night.

05:58.999 --> 05:59.999
- Who, Faith?

05:59.999 --> 06:01.999
- No, a different one.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.000
- Now, suddenly,
he's jumping into something new

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
or jumping onto
something new,

06:05.999 --> 06:06.999
literally.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
- Max.
- Hey. How you doing, buddy?

06:08.999 --> 06:09.999
- You're doing much better.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
I can see it in your face.
- I am, yeah, I am.

06:11.999 --> 06:12.999
- Looks good, looks good.
Let's take a peek here.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
That was where they were before.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
- Oh, my...
- Not very attractive, is it?

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
- Just simply by repositioning
the teeth...

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
- Are you seriou--
- And putting them back

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
in the right position
and stabilizing them,

06:21.999 --> 06:24.999
that's all solved.
- Now he's with somebody else?

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
- Yeah.
She's a little bit older.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.000
She's got, uh...
- Older?

06:27.999 --> 06:28.999
- Yeah.
He likes the older girls.

06:28.999 --> 06:29.999
He's got a bit of--

06:29.999 --> 06:32.000
- Are you kidding me?
- He doesn't really like

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
younger girls--you kinda think
they're all dumb, to be honest.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
- They're all stupid.
- I like the younger ones.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
Kristen was a bit
of an exception, you know.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
She was like my cougar year.
- Oh, you're still crazy

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
about Kristen.
- I don't know what there is

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
with me and Kristen
anymore.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- I think Kristen
can be a little toxic,

06:45.999 --> 06:46.999
self-destructive.

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
- You treat me like
a f***ing boy toy!

06:48.999 --> 06:49.999
- James, get the f***

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
out of my face--now!
- Ow! What the--

06:51.999 --> 06:54.999
- She mirrors his behavior,

06:54.999 --> 06:55.999
and maybe
that's comforting to him.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
- I drunk texted her
last night, apparently.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

06:59.999 --> 07:00.999
'Cause my emotions
spill out of me

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
when I'm a little tipsy,
I guess.

07:02.999 --> 07:03.999
- Why would you even
do that?

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
Why would you
ignite something?

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- I've been in this phase
lately--

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
a lot of
one-night stands--

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
and it's just not anything

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
like what it's like to be
in a real loving relationship

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
like I had with Kristen.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- Thank you.
- I'll see you

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
in a couple of weeks, all right?
- All right.

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
- Try to leave
that tooth in place.

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
- How you feeling?
You feel better?

07:18.999 --> 07:19.999
- Yeah.
- You feel good, you feel clean?

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
- Perfect.
- Good.

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
I drunk texted Lala as well
and got myself in some trouble,

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
so she's a little bit
angry at me.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
- Okay, I will go ahead
and confirm you.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
You're very welcome.
Bye-bye.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
Oh, hey, boo.
- Hi.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
- What are you doing?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
- Just doin'
some roll-ups.

07:39.999 --> 07:42.999
- Can I just tell you
how pissed off I am at James?

07:42.999 --> 07:45.999
Like, I want to
tear his face off.

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
- Why?
- You remember my ex,

07:46.999 --> 07:49.999
the guy that I've been dating
for a long time.

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
- Mm-hmm.
- There's just, like,

07:50.999 --> 07:53.999
something about
my relationship with Hayes

07:53.999 --> 07:55.999
that it's just--
it's something I cherish.

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
Hayes is a football player.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
We were together
for a long time.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.999
It's always been long-distance.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999
But we just can't
quite ax it yet.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
So he came into town
and, you know,

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
when we get together
it's just comfortable

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
and we get freaky

08:11.000 --> 08:13.999
just like you do with your man
when he's in town.

08:13.999 --> 08:15.999
- Uh-huh.
- And James sent me

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
a text message
that's about this long

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
basically telling me
that I'm a whore,

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
I love ugly dudes.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- What'd you send to her?
- Do you wanna read it, mate?

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
- Yeah.
- There you go.

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
- "So don't say we chillin'

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
when you clearly got plans
with some ugly f***head."

08:30.999 --> 08:31.999
- Oh, this is sweet.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
- "Also heard how you were
killing some ass****

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
and kissing me after."

08:35.999 --> 08:37.000
What does that mean?
- Faith told me

08:37.999 --> 08:38.999
that she was eating some
ass**** the night before,

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
and then we met up the next day.
- Are you f***ing kidding?

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
- Yeah, dude, it was disgusting.
- What do you mean--what?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
- Rim job.
- What are you talking about?

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
- I am not gonna listen to this.
- Lala was licking.

08:46.999 --> 08:47.999
- Stop it!
Give it to me.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
- You wanna look at that?
- Give it to me now.

08:49.999 --> 08:50.999
- Give it to me.

08:50.999 --> 08:51.999
Do not talk about
things like that

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
in front of me.
- Sorry, Mom.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
- I did actually
wash Max's mouth out with soap

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
when he was a little kid,

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
and I feel like
doing it to James.

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
And I think, actually...

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
I should probably do it
to Lala.

09:03.999 --> 09:06.999
- James seriously, like,

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
needs a reality check.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.000
He thinks he can just do
whatever and say whatever

09:10.999 --> 09:13.999
and, like, he doesn't understand
what respect is.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
He doesn't understand how to
properly speak to a woman,

09:15.999 --> 09:16.999
like...
- No.

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
- It's literally
out of control.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.999
James has a lot of issues.

09:21.999 --> 09:25.000
He's the loudest person
I've ever met in my entire life,

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
one of the most obnoxious people
I've ever met in my entire life,

09:28.999 --> 09:31.999
and one of the most emotional.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.999
James can be
an immature little twat.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
- I mean,
he's a 23-year-old kid.

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
- Yeah.
But he's a 23-year-old adult...

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
- Right.
- Who acts like a kid.

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
- Exactly.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
- But she's also
a funny one, though,

09:43.999 --> 09:44.999
because you know what?

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
She is trusting
of way too many people

09:46.999 --> 09:49.999
that she seems to think are
her friends, and they're not.

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
- Like...
like example. What?

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
- Like Jax and his monkey
dumbf*** ass

09:53.999 --> 09:56.999
who's stealing now,
getting felonies in Hawaii?

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
- It's embarrassing...
- I am not praising--

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
- He's still working for you!
- Can you calm down?

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
He is suspended.

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
He is not working for me.
- Definitely a ho.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- Will you stop it?
That's nothing to do with you.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
I actually don't need any help
from pipsqueak busboy

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
running my business,

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
so thank you, James Kennedy,

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
but I will pass
on your managerial advice.

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
- I feel like he gets
away with everything,

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
and I'm sacking the sh**box
every five minutes.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- Does he get away
with everything?

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
He's probably gonna be
standing trial in Hawaii,

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
and he's been suspended.
- I hope he is!

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
His old man should
f***ing learn about that.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
- That's got
nothing to do with you.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
You're acting like
a little brat.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
You need to grow up.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
Your mother asked me
to give you a job as a busboy.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
- I know.
Yes, I know.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.999
- And that's exactly what
you will be doing again

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
if you don't show
some respect.

10:36.999 --> 10:37.999
- Uh, then Pump's probably
gonna be a lot less busy,

10:37.999 --> 10:38.999
because I've been
bringing people in

10:39.000 --> 10:41.999
for my music a lot, actually.
- Oh, puh-lease!

10:41.999 --> 10:42.999
- Pump will live before you
and after you

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
the same as every other of the
26 restaurants, bars, and clubs

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
that I've had before--

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
- We have been getting
constant reviews

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
on our music.

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
You can read
the Yelp reviews yourself

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
on how good the music
has been.

10:53.999 --> 10:54.999
We're waiting for a CD.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
- I don't know
who James thinks he is,

10:58.999 --> 10:59.999
but the way
he's raising his voice,

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
he's kinda getting
out of his pram.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
He needs to get
right back in it.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.000
He knows what I'm talking about.
He's English.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.999
See? Glad you got what I'm
talking about.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.999
Coming up...

11:09.999 --> 11:10.999
- I mean,
I can either sober up

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
right after dinner
and go home

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
or we can get drinks

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
and I can sleep on your
couch downstairs.

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
- We need to go
to a club or something

11:29.999 --> 11:30.999
with some music.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.999
I want to see a DJ--
- Hi.

11:32.999 --> 11:33.999
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?

11:33.999 --> 11:35.999
- How are you doing?
- Good.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.999
- Um...so I wanted to talk
to you guys about something.

11:37.999 --> 11:40.999
It's not, like, the thing
I want to say

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
but just because
I'm sure

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
you're gonna hear stuff
from other people,

11:44.999 --> 11:46.000
and I just wanted
to kind of explain.

11:46.999 --> 11:50.999
So I'm having a launch party
for my beauty blog...

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
- Oh, that's awesome!
- To sort of celebrate it

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
and introduce it,
but unfortunately,

11:53.999 --> 11:56.999
I can't extend
the invitation to you.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.000
- Where I'm from,
you don't go up to someone

11:58.999 --> 11:59.999
and tell them about a party

11:59.999 --> 12:02.000
and then give them some kind of
formal un-invitation.

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
So you're telling me I can't
go to your event, Katie?

12:04.999 --> 12:07.999
Is this some kind of American
custom that I don't know about?

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
- I hope you guys understand.
- I understand.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
- I'm gonna get back
to work, though, guys.

12:12.999 --> 12:13.999
- Let me know if you
have any questions.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
I'll be right back.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
- So you're having
an event

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
or some party
for your blog?

12:19.999 --> 12:22.999
- Yeah, we're having the first
official launch party for it.

12:22.999 --> 12:25.999
- I obviously
was not invited.

12:25.999 --> 12:26.999
I just wanted
to make sure, like...

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
there's no, like,
personal reason why

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
I wouldn't be invited.

12:30.999 --> 12:31.999
- I don't want any drama.

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
I don't want
any other stresses.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
- So are you saying
that if I were to be there,

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
I would add stress
and bring drama?

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
- No.
That's not what I'm saying.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.999
It's just strictly
a capacity thing.

12:42.999 --> 12:47.999
- I probably shouldn't...

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
care much that I wasn't invited.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
But...it's a sensitive
subject for me.

12:53.999 --> 12:57.999
I had this time
when I was in elementary school

12:57.999 --> 13:00.999
and everybody, our entire grade,
was invited to this party.

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
But once I got there,

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
the plan was to tell me
that I was not invited,

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
and then they made me
sit out on the curb

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
and wait for my mom.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
- I can only have, like,
30 people on the guest list,

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
and majority of those
are industry people.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
- Okay.
- So don't feel too bad.

13:13.999 --> 13:14.999
- I completely understand.

13:14.999 --> 13:16.999
I'm happy for you, man.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
I hope it goes well.
- Thank you.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
- I've never really
sat on my stoop.

13:26.999 --> 13:27.999
I feel like it's kinda gangster

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
that I'm sitting
on the stoop.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
- Have you heard anything
from the lawyers lately?

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
- Best-case scenario,
it's gonna get knocked down

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
to a misdemeanor,
but, um,

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
I was waiting until the judge--
what he wants me to do, or...

13:37.999 --> 13:38.999
- Yeah.
- I can't really do anything

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
until he tells me
what to do.

13:40.999 --> 13:41.999
There's definitely a couple
different scenarios

13:41.999 --> 13:42.999
that could happen here.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
You know, one, this could be
just a slap on the wrist

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
best-case scenario.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.999
Two, I'd have to
go back to Hawaii,

13:48.999 --> 13:52.000
go to jail, have more fines
slapped on top of me.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.999
I'm really ready just for
this sh** to be over with.

13:54.999 --> 13:57.000
- I mean,
think about how dumb

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
and how much more money
you're gonna be spending.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
- That's why I need to work.

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
- Well, good thing
you have me.

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
- Thank God for Hooters.

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
- Hi!
Welcome to Hooters.

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
- You know, after I apologized
to your mother,

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
what did your mom say?

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
- She just said the same
thing that she said to you.

14:11.999 --> 14:15.999
She told me that, you know,
being drunk is an excuse.

14:15.999 --> 14:16.999
- I know.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.000
- Neither one
of my parents drink.

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
- Your mother doesn't have
a glass of wine at night.

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
- Very, very rarely.

14:20.999 --> 14:22.999
- Brittany's upbringing
is very--

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
she's a very--
comes from a Christian family.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.999
I haven't even met
her mom and dad yet.

14:25.999 --> 14:26.999
They do live on the farm.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
They don't drink.
There's no alcohol.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.000
There's no cursing.

14:30.999 --> 14:31.999
I mean, they're...
extremely Southern...

14:31.999 --> 14:34.999
Catholic--Christian,
or whatever they are.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.999
But they're extremely
by the book.

14:36.999 --> 14:38.999
Isn't it nice out?

14:39.999 --> 14:40.999
Jax!

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
- What?
- Stop!

14:42.999 --> 14:44.000
- It's outside.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
- I told you get away from me
when you fart.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- Oh, my God, it isn't that bad.
- Please quit!

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
- Such a gentleman.

15:02.999 --> 15:05.999
And a scholar.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.000
- You order drinks?
- Yeah, we do.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
- Yeah.
- We need alcohol.

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
- Sake, beer...

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
- Can we get a large Nigori,
please?

15:10.999 --> 15:13.999
- Yeah.
Uh, big big, or...

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
- Ginormous.
- Okay.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- Massive.
- She's a big drinker,

15:16.999 --> 15:18.999
so I gotta
keep up with her.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- Aleks is a good friend
of mine

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
that I met about
a year and a half ago.

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
I have a date on Tuesday.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
- What is his name?
- Aleks.

15:25.999 --> 15:28.999
Yacht captain.
- Oh, I know Aleks!

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
- Thank you.

15:29.999 --> 15:31.999
These scare me,
but I love them.

15:31.999 --> 15:32.999
Aleks has his sh** together.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
He has a great career.

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
You swear to God, though.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
He's a gentleman.

15:39.999 --> 15:40.999
Okay, go.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.999
He's sweet, he's funny.

15:42.999 --> 15:43.999
He is hot.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
He's a man.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.999
- So what happened
with you and that guy?

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
- It's weird to, like, be
alone, but now it's, like nice.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
- Do you see his
true colors and all that?

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
- Yeah!
Like, what a douche!

15:54.999 --> 15:57.999
My first single girl
dating experience

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
did not go well.

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
- Did he move in?

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- Kevin's decided to stay.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
I thought you were cool.
I was wrong.

16:04.999 --> 16:07.999
Lesson learned.
Go away.

16:07.999 --> 16:10.999
But Aleks is not
a little pussy boy like Kevin.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
Thank you.
Why do I feel like

16:11.999 --> 16:12.999
I'm really way ahead of you?

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
- It's fine.
I'll catch up.

16:14.999 --> 16:15.999
- What do you want to do
after dinner?

16:15.999 --> 16:17.999
- Go to a bar;
get some whiskey?

16:17.999 --> 16:18.999
- So, like, get drinks?
Yeah.

16:18.999 --> 16:19.999
- Yep.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
- Packed a bag.

16:21.999 --> 16:22.999
- For what?

16:22.999 --> 16:24.999
- I mean,
I can either sober up

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
right after dinner
and go home

16:26.999 --> 16:29.999
or we can get drinks...

16:29.999 --> 16:32.999
and I can sleep on
your couch downstairs.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.999
- We'll see what happens.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.999
- Since I broke up with James,

16:38.999 --> 16:41.999
it just feels so great
to have this positive energy.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
It's like I'm living...
a rom-com.

16:43.999 --> 16:47.000
I've changed a lot.
- Yeah, since I first met you.

16:47.999 --> 16:48.999
- I respect myself.
That's why.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
I used to not respect myself.
- No.

16:50.999 --> 16:52.999
Like, I wouldn't have
tooken you on a date

16:52.999 --> 16:53.999
when I met you.

16:53.999 --> 16:55.999
- Yeah?
- Seriously.

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
- I get to have fun
with great guys...

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
The date is paying
the bill.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
This is brand-new to me.
- Oh, really?

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
You used to, uh,
take care of your boys?

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
- Just good friends
and hot make out sessions.

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
- Our first kiss.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
- It's exactly what I pictured.

17:14.999 --> 17:15.999
People are like,
"Get a room!"

17:22.999 --> 17:25.999
- Do all--
- Planning sh** is so hard.

17:25.999 --> 17:28.999
- Wait until it's your wedding.
- I know...

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
- Hello.
- Hi!

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
- What are you two doing?
- Not gossiping.

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
- What are you doing?
- About to pop a bottle.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.999
- I'm going back
to the bar right now.

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
- Okay.
- That's what I'm doing.

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
- Um, I don't know if I
talked to you about it much,

17:38.999 --> 17:42.999
but I have a beauty
and lifestyle blog,

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
Pucker & Pout.
- Pucker & Pout.

17:43.999 --> 17:44.999
Yeah,
I know about that.

17:44.999 --> 17:47.999
- Yeah,
I decided it was time

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
to really give
Pucker & Pout a party,

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
and I really want you
to come.

17:50.999 --> 17:51.999
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe I'll come by.

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
I'm not puckering and pouting.

17:52.999 --> 17:55.999
- There definitely
comes a point

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
in everyone's lives at Sur
where you just say to yourself,

17:57.999 --> 17:58.999
"This isn't enough.

17:58.999 --> 18:01.999
I need to find something that
I really am passionate about."

18:01.999 --> 18:03.999
So I was thinking about
some appetizers from Sur.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
- And who's gonna pay for it?

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
- Me. I'm paying for
all of this.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
- Okay, I'll give you
a staff discount.

18:09.999 --> 18:10.999
- Okay.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
- I don't want to
support you too much

18:12.999 --> 18:15.999
'cause if this is a success,
then you end up leaving me.

18:15.999 --> 18:16.999
This is what
I want to see.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
I want to see them go off

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
and then get back to work
at Sur,

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
'cause I don't
want to lose them.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
I actually want to
talk to you.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
Um...

18:26.999 --> 18:27.999
Stassi came by.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.999
- She was on
hands and knees, or...

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
- Virtually.

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
I don't know how
you want to handle it.

18:33.999 --> 18:34.999
- I don't want to
handle it at all,

18:34.999 --> 18:37.999
because I put it to bed,
I moved on with my life.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
I'm great.
I have amazing things happening.

18:39.999 --> 18:40.999
She's been throwing herself
a pity party,

18:40.999 --> 18:42.999
and I'm just like,
"I'm sorry,

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
but I think
that's what you get."

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
Like, this is your bed
and now you can lie in it.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
I don't need to go in
and feel sorry for you.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
My friendship with Stassi
was mostly one-sided.

18:49.999 --> 18:52.999
Everything suited her.
Everything was on her terms.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
I'm done with her.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.999
I've moved on, and I'm happy
without Stassi in my life.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
I would learn nothing
in my life

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
if I just, like,
open my arms back to her.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
- That's up to you.
- I don't want to do it.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
- Coming up...
- That's f***ing disgusting.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
- What goes down in your
bedroom is not my business,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.999
and what goes down in my bedroom
is none of yours.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.000
- Sur Restaurant.
This is Lala.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.999
How can I help you?

19:24.999 --> 19:27.999
The restaurant
actually opens at 5:30.

19:27.999 --> 19:28.999
- Hey, Chef Joe.

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
I was just coming
to check on the stuff

19:30.999 --> 19:32.999
for Katie's party.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
- Hey, can I talk to you
for just a second?

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
- Yeah. 'Sup?

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- Um...

19:38.999 --> 19:41.999
the text message that you
sent me the other night.

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
- Yeah.
What about it?

19:43.999 --> 19:46.999
Look, I apologize
for drunk texting you, Lala,

19:46.999 --> 19:49.999
but listen--
- It's happened a lot, James.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.999
You drunk text me
a lot.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
- Most of the time
it's nice, though, isn't it?

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
- No, it's not.
You go in, and it's like...

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
things that you've obviously
been harboring,

19:57.999 --> 19:58.999
and then it comes out
when you're drunk.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
And it's not okay for you
to speak to me

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
the way that you
speak to me.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
- Okay, what's not okay
is for you

20:03.999 --> 20:06.999
to go f***ing tossing
someone else's salad--

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
- Okay, I don't even know
where that came from,

20:08.999 --> 20:09.999
first of all,
and second of all, guess what.

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
- Came from Faith.
Faith told me.

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
- Who's in my bed...
- Faith told me.

20:12.999 --> 20:13.999
- When I do intimate things
with someone

20:13.999 --> 20:15.999
who I love and adore...
- It's none of my business.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.999
- Great. But guess what.
- And haven't been--

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
- Don't f***ing have me
in your bed the next day then.

20:19.999 --> 20:20.999
Simple.

20:20.999 --> 20:21.999
- What, do you have amnesia,
dude?

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
We just had a conversation
at a photo shoot

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
where we laid down
ground rules,

20:25.999 --> 20:26.999
and now you're tripping
about this.

20:26.999 --> 20:28.000
- What are we,
just friends that--

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
we're just making out
all the time?

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
- We're friends that make out.
- All right.

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
- And you can have anybody
touch your peep.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
You can never get mad
if anything happens,

20:34.999 --> 20:36.000
because I've laid it out

20:36.999 --> 20:37.999
like so perfect--
- Fine.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.999
Okay, listen,
you know what?

20:39.999 --> 20:40.999
You can **** whatever
the f*** you want, okay?

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
- Thank you.
Yes, I can.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.999
- Just don't go trying
to get with me

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
the next day, 'cause
it's f***ing disgusting and--

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
- Um, you go out with me
the next day

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
after you f***ed Lauren
and whoever else,

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
and I don't say, "Well,
what did you do to Lauren

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
and what did Lauren
do to you?"

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
Why? Because that's
your f***ing business.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
What goes down in your
bedroom is not my business,

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
and what goes down
in my bedroom is none of yours.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
James is a spoiled brat...

21:02.999 --> 21:06.999
spoiled bitch when he
doesn't get what he wants.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
- You f***ing hit me up
when you're lonely and insecure.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
- What are you talking about?
- Those are the days

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
you hit me up, babe, only
the days you're f***ing lonely

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
or you ain't got anyone else
to f***ing hang out with you.

21:14.999 --> 21:15.999
You're f***ing fake as f***,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.999
and you should f***ing
learn your lesson, babe.

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
- That's a stupid thing to say--
- Yeah, well,

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
you're a stupid thing
to say.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
- Look gorgeous!

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
- I sneezed, and my mascara
went all over my face.

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
- There is a pink
carpet also,

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
right?
- Yep.

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
- Pucker & Pout
is Katie's baby,

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
and I couldn't be
more proud of her.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.999
So I'm her to help her
with whatever she needs.

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
I will be her bitch.

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- Hi.
- What's going on?

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
- So I forgot the lights
for the step and repeat.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
- Can we send Tom?
- He's gotta do the bar.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
- You bring your shaker?
- No, I didn't bring anything.

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
Did you bring it? Okay, good.
- 'Course I did.

21:55.999 --> 21:56.999
- I knew you wouldn't
bring sh**.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
- I told you--
shut up, dude.

21:59.999 --> 22:00.999
- Heidi, wow!
- Ah!

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
- Sexy!
- Thanks.

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
- Where did those come from?

22:03.999 --> 22:05.000
- Boobs on fleek.

22:05.999 --> 22:06.999
- I'm gonna go get
those lights, okay?

22:06.999 --> 22:09.999
- Actually, I think Courtney
has hers in her car,

22:09.999 --> 22:11.999
and she should be on her way
here in just a few minutes.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.999
- Okay.
- I think we're gonna be okay.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
- Okay, by the way,
we got you guys, all right?

22:14.999 --> 22:16.000
You guys need anything,
you tell us.

22:16.999 --> 22:18.000
Stassi shows up, and her head
starts spinning around

22:18.000 --> 22:19.999
like "The Exorcist",
tell us.

22:19.999 --> 22:21.999
Jax starts stealing
gift bags...

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
Jax starts stealing
gift bags.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
When someone tells you
they're gonna start a blog,

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
it's easy to be...
incredulous.

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
However,
I gotta give Katie credit

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
because she's been
kicking ass.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
- The girls are ready
at the braid bar.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
The boys are ready
behind the bar.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
Now we just need people
to come.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
- Yeah.

22:46.999 --> 22:47.999
- Hello!

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
- What's up?
- Is that for me?

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
- That is for you.
- Yes. Thank you.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.999
- Might be a little
watered down,

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
'cause it's been
sitting in here, but...

22:55.999 --> 22:57.000
What's crackin'?

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
- Nothing. Just been
looking at apartments.

22:59.999 --> 23:03.999
And I found a couple
that I really, really like.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:05.999 --> 23:06.999
- Do you have applications?
- Yes.

23:06.999 --> 23:07.999
- Okay, good.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
- I feel like such
a squatter, it's insane.

23:09.999 --> 23:13.999
I realize that, like, I have
a special talent for squatting.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
- Well, I already told you,
this is actually good for me.

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
Like, you being here
is good for me,

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
because then we have
slumber parties

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
and watch TV and drink.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
Just drink.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
Oh, my God!
- Hmm.

23:25.999 --> 23:28.999
- So I unblocked James's
number the other day.

23:28.999 --> 23:29.999
- Okay.

23:29.999 --> 23:30.999
4:07 a.m.

23:30.999 --> 23:33.999
"How do you not
still love me?"

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
With a kissy face
emoji.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
That's so annoying.
- Suck a dick.

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
I have a great
group of friend.

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
I'm dating great guys
that are polite

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
and well-mannered
and not mean and cruel.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
- Yeah.
- I really f***ing adore Aleks.

23:47.999 --> 23:49.999
And I'm really stoked
that he's coming tonight

23:50.000 --> 23:51.999
to the Pucker & Pout
thing with me.

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
- It's so weird
that I'm not going tonight.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.999
You know what I feel like
this is?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
It feels like the engagement
all over again.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- I was just gonna say that.

23:58.999 --> 24:01.999
Because you, like, remember
when she started the blog.

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
Like, I don't.
I wasn't around for that.

24:03.999 --> 24:04.999
- Yeah, she wanted
to do it with me.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
We were gonna do it together
and I was like,

24:06.999 --> 24:09.999
"You know, you never know
what happens...in friendships."

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
Ha ha.

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
- I have my own fashion blog.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
Try and put that ring up
a little bit

24:15.999 --> 24:17.999
just as much
as you possibly can.

24:17.999 --> 24:18.999
I was there when Katie
started the blog,

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
and I helped her take photos

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
and helped her
with some of the pieces.

24:22.999 --> 24:24.999
It's just another reminder

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
that I'm missing out
on milestones.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
I feel like sh** about
where our friendship is at.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.000
- It's sad.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.999
- Yeah, but she won't
respond to me,

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
and I feel like I don't really
know what else to do.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
- Have you talked
to Schwartz at all?

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
- I've thought about
reaching out to him and...

24:39.000 --> 24:40.999
But that also feels like

24:40.999 --> 24:41.999
I don't want to go
behind Katie's back

24:41.999 --> 24:42.999
and reach out
to her fiancé.

24:42.999 --> 24:43.999
Like, it's weird.
- Yeah.

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
It's a f***ing rock
and a hard place,

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
'cause he was
your friend too.

24:46.999 --> 24:50.000
- I just need to find a way
to let Katie know for real

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
that I regret a lot of
the mistakes that I made.

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
And Schwartz could be
the back door.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
I just don't know what
the right thing to do is.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
- I don't know.

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
- Oi.
- How you doing?

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
- How's your mouth, bro?

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
You feeling good?
- I am, a lot better.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
Thanks for coming, by the way.
- Yeah, dude.

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
I wanted to talk with you
about that.

25:10.999 --> 25:11.999
You don't think I was
a little bit rude

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
to your mom yesterday,
do you?

25:13.999 --> 25:14.999
- Uh...
- I felt kinda

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
f***ing rude
when I left.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
- She knows you're going
through a hard time too, so...

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
you're stressed out
by other things.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.999
- Yeah. Dude, so I'm already
talking to Lala.

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
- Yeah.
- Sur's not even

25:23.999 --> 25:25.000
f***ing open yet,
and I'm already pissed off,

25:25.999 --> 25:26.999
like I'm already getting
f***ing agitated

25:26.999 --> 25:27.999
for no f***ing reason.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
Like these girls,
they seem to think

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
they can f***ing
play around, lie,

25:31.999 --> 25:33.999
and basically go do
all these f***ed up things.

25:33.999 --> 25:34.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- What the f***

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
kind of relationship is this?
- It's kinda weird.

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
- It's very f***ing weird.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
And then that just only
gets me bouncing to Kristen,

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
like thinking about
Kristen again

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
like after f***ing drunk texting
her the other night alone,

25:43.999 --> 25:45.999
which--did it for a reason.
- Right.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.000
- Obviously, when I was
going through a hard time,

25:47.999 --> 25:49.999
I would talk to Kristen
about things, um,

25:49.999 --> 25:51.999
and she would listen.

25:51.999 --> 25:52.999
She was good at taking care
of me, you know?

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
I miss that.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.999
She...she knows me
so well, dude.

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
We were together, like...

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
together, nonstop,
for over a year, bro,

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
a year and a half.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
- You loved each other,
you know?

26:02.999 --> 26:03.999
- We did love each other,
yeah, so, you know,

26:03.999 --> 26:06.999
it's just like I haven't,
like, met any...one like...

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
like her yet.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
- Are you still thinking
about her like that?

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
- Dude, lately, I've been
thinking about her more.

26:11.999 --> 26:12.999
Am I still in love
with Kristen? Yes.

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
Do I still want to
make it work? Yeah.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
It's a f***ed up thing,

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
but that's...that's where
I am right now.

26:18.999 --> 26:19.999
I just feel like
I need a chat with her.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
- You gotta arrange
something with her.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
- Well, dude, she's blocked me
on all social medias.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.999
I can't go to her house.
I'm out of options, really.

26:26.999 --> 26:28.999
But I did hear from Katie
that, uh,

26:28.999 --> 26:31.999
Kristen's gonna be at
her launch party tonight.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
- Oh, right, yeah.
- So I was thinking, uh,

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
I was thinking we could
f***ing go crash it, mate.

26:35.999 --> 26:37.999
You really want to?

26:37.999 --> 26:39.999
- Yeah.
- Well, I owe you a favor,

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
so I think...
I think that's--

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
Yeah, why not?

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
- Yeah, mate!

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
- Coming up...
- You're f***ing Kristen Doute.

26:47.999 --> 26:49.999
You've made more
f***ups than anyone else.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.999
You've broken nearly every one
of your f***ing friends' hearts.

27:01.999 --> 27:03.999
a magazine ♪

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
♪ Wanna be the "it" girl ♪

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
♪ You know what I mean ♪

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
- I'm so proud of you.
I'm so, so proud of you.

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
- Thank you.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
I want tonight
to be interactive,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
There's a braid bar right here.
There's three chairs.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.999
I want it to be
a whole beauty experience.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
And then downstairs
there's a brow bar

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
if you wanna get your brows
or whatever.

27:21.999 --> 27:24.999
- Can they make mine
look like yours?

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
- Usually what I do is just
kinda lift them up and trim.

27:29.999 --> 27:30.999
- Yeah, perfect.
- And if I start to get

27:30.999 --> 27:33.999
a little bit of a unibrow,
I can clean that up.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
This is not like getting
your teeth laser whitened.

27:35.999 --> 27:38.999
This is basic upkeep.

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
- You--
It looks good.

27:39.999 --> 27:40.999
- All right.
- It looks good.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
It's not too much.

27:42.999 --> 27:45.999
- Jax's look--
too manicured.

27:45.999 --> 27:46.999
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
He looks straight off
"The Jersey Shore."

27:48.999 --> 27:51.000
It's not a big deal, and it
doesn't mean you're feminine.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.999
You just take care of yourself.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
- So we're at your
blog debut.

27:54.999 --> 27:56.999
What inspired you
to get into fashion blogging?

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
- One of my girlfriends,

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999
she was kind of instrumental
in encouraging me

28:00.000 --> 28:02.999
to kind of put kind of
put all of my style

28:02.999 --> 28:05.999
and beauty tricks
out into the world to share.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.000
- Hey, bartender.
- I know what you want.

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
I got you. I got you.
- I knew the time--hey.

28:09.999 --> 28:12.999
I knew the time would come
you'd be serving me a drink.

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
- How long do you think
we'll be here?

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
- Ten minutes, ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

28:16.999 --> 28:18.999
- Just have a glass of wine.
I want to support Katie.

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
That's all I want to do.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.999
Oh, Kristen's ass--

28:22.999 --> 28:24.999
That's the first thing
I need to see

28:24.999 --> 28:25.999
as I come on in here.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
Perfect.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
- You're wearing
my color?

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
Hi.

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
- Thank you for coming!

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
- You're welcome.
- Yay!

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
- How's it going?
- Great!

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
- Good.
- I'm getting a little stressed

28:36.999 --> 28:38.000
because...
- Why are you stressed?

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
- Where's Tom?

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
- He's pouring sangria
outside.

28:41.999 --> 28:44.999
- Oh, my God, that's why
you're stressed, sweetie.

28:44.999 --> 28:47.000
Tom Schwartzie behind the bar!

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
Give me your best shot.
What have you got?

28:49.999 --> 28:50.999
- My God, is it...
- Schwartzie!

28:50.999 --> 28:51.999
- Is it getting
hotter in here?

28:51.999 --> 28:52.999
- Running hot
under the collar.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.999
- When Lisa walks into
a room...whew.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
It gets hot fast.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
- Cheers, Katie.
I support you, sweetie.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
- Thank you so much!
- Yeah!

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
Cheers.
- Cheers, Katie.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.999
- I'm proud of Katie

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
that she's actually pursuing
other interests out of Sur.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.000
She's branching out,

29:08.999 --> 29:10.999
and I think now she's got
the confidence to do so.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
- It's, like, 10:00.
Sh**.

29:12.999 --> 29:15.999
- He's showing off
his Rolex.

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
- I wasn't trying to do that.
- It's his new one.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
It's his second Rolex.

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
- Who owns two?

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
- Don't even ask me
about Sur.

29:22.999 --> 29:23.999
Do not ask me about working,
don't ask me

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
about anything right now.
- I'm not.

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- This is about Katie,
and it's not about you.

29:27.999 --> 29:28.999
I know that's hard for you.
- Hey, listen,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.999
I got the old ball and chain
over here making money.

29:30.999 --> 29:32.999
I'm good.
- So what was his punishment?

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
- Sex more than one time a day.
- Yeah.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
- What's behind us?

29:41.999 --> 29:43.999
Someone...
- Who do you think is?

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
- What?

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
- No, it's just funny,
'cause...

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
I had to tell, like,

29:50.000 --> 29:51.999
James the other night
at work

29:51.999 --> 29:53.999
that he couldn't come,
unfortunately,

29:53.999 --> 29:54.999
because you know, like...
- Yeah.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
- We kind of had enough
people as it was,

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
and he just walks in.

29:58.999 --> 29:59.999
- Wait--James did?
- Yeah.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.999
- Hey, Mom. How you doing?
You all right?

30:01.999 --> 30:03.999
- How are your teeth?
- It's better, yeah.

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
- I mean, it's one thing
to crash a house party.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
It's another
to crash a launch party.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.999
James knows how important
tonight is for Katie,

30:11.999 --> 30:13.999
and he was specifically
uninvited,

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
so why the f*** is he here?

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
I thought...Katie was like,

30:17.999 --> 30:19.000
"Oh, you know,
I'm having an event..."

30:19.999 --> 30:20.999
- Oh, yeah, I know,
I crashed it.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
- That's it?
- Yeah.

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
- You just wanted
to come to a party?

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
- Oh, no, I came to talk
to Kristen, silly.

30:25.999 --> 30:28.000
- I'm sorry, can you just
not have the hood on?

30:28.999 --> 30:29.999
- Why?
- I don't know.

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
- It's part of everything.
Relax.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
- What the f***?
- Beat up on Eminem?

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
- Hey, man.
You probably hate me.

30:35.999 --> 30:36.999
I don't know the stories
you've heard.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.999
I'm James.

30:38.999 --> 30:39.999
- You don't need to--
- I just want to chat with her

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
for two minutes, that's all.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
- I don't think she
wants to chat with you.

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
- I'm serious shaking his hand.

30:45.999 --> 30:46.999
Like, I've been a man.
- Fine.

30:46.999 --> 30:49.999
- So can we go outside
and chat real quick?

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
- You can walk away for, like--
You can back up.

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
- Okay, that's cool.
I'll be outside.

30:52.999 --> 30:54.999
- Should I talk to him?
- Go talk to him.

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
- Will you put, like,
a timer on your...

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
- Yeah, I'll put a--
- f***ing Rolex

30:58.000 --> 31:00.999
that says 4 1/2 minutes.

31:00.999 --> 31:02.999
- All right,
I'll clock ya.

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
- I'll help you.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.999
- Have fun.

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
- He wants a reaction
out of me

31:07.999 --> 31:09.999
'cause he wants to, like,
know that he's, like, adored.

31:09.999 --> 31:12.999
Like, suck a dick, bro.

31:12.999 --> 31:15.999
- Oh, here you are.
- Yep. What up?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
- Come chat.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
- What do you want?

31:20.999 --> 31:23.999
- Kristen, why are you so--
why are you so, like,

31:23.999 --> 31:24.999
standoff of me?
What is this?

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- 'Cause I want nothing
to do with you.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
The last text you sent me
was, "I hope you're happy."

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
I've never been happier
in my entire life.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
Like, life is so--
- You're not that happy.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
That's what people say
when they're not happy.

31:34.999 --> 31:35.999
"I'm so happy.
I'm so happy."

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
- No, I am.
- You ain't happy!

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
No you're not, darling.

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
- Like, I don't know
what you want from me.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
I don't--
- I wanna hug it out

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
and be chill.
That's all I want.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
- But I don't.
I don't even think of you.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
- I'm not having
this conversation with you...

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- A few days ago--
- This is what you do!

31:49.999 --> 31:50.999
This is what you do,

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
and this is how we raise
voices every time.

31:52.999 --> 31:54.999
I'm not raising my voice.
- You don't get to yell at me.

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
- But quite frankly, darling--
- Don't call me darling.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
- Why?
- I want nothing to do with you.

31:57.999 --> 31:58.999
- Why?
- 'Cause you're disgusting.

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
You treat me
like sh** and--

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
- You treated me like
sh** plenty of times,

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
and I'm forgiving you for that.
- I don't want--

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- Shut up.
I'm a f***ing man, all right?

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
I walk up to your f***ing
ugly boyfriend upstairs,

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
shake his hand
like a f***ing bloke.

32:08.999 --> 32:09.999
You, on the other hand,

32:09.999 --> 32:11.999
you're cringing and shaking
every five minutes,

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
calling me f***ing names
nonstop.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
You're f***ing
Kristen Doute.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
You've made more f***ups
than anyone else.

32:16.999 --> 32:19.999
You've broken nearly every one
of your f***ing friends' hearts.

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
I'm done with this conversation.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
Have a happy life with your
ugly f***ing boyfriend.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
- James, move on.
Date someone.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.999
Just leave me alone.

32:28.999 --> 32:30.999
- Aw, f***ing hell.
- That went well.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- Hey, are you okay?

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
- I just feel like--
- I could kill someone

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
for ruining this, like...

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- It'll be him,
'cause I'll murder him for you.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
With my bare hands.

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- I'll hold you to that.
- Life his skinny ass up.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
- Come here!
- And throw him on to Melrose.

32:45.999 --> 32:48.000
- We're going up.
- What?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
- We're going up.
- Oh, you're not coming?

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
- No, we're good.
Let's party.

32:52.999 --> 32:55.999
- Coming up...
- Look who decides to text me.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
- Oh, God. 504?
- It's Stassi.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.999
♪ We gonna live it up ♪

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
♪ Gonna live it up ♪

33:09.999 --> 33:10.999
- I just wanna thank
everyone for coming.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.999
It means the world to me

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
that all of you come out
to support.

33:14.999 --> 33:17.999
I couldn't be more proud and
we're so excited for the future.

33:17.999 --> 33:19.999
And I feel like I'm gonna cry,
so I'm gonna stop talking.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.999
But thank you all so much.

33:21.999 --> 33:22.999
I hope you had fun.

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
Tonight was such a success.

33:24.999 --> 33:27.000
The only hiccup
is that James showed up,

33:27.000 --> 33:28.999
but even that couldn't ruin it.

33:28.999 --> 33:30.999
- Dude, dude.
- What?

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
- Look who decided
to text me.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
- Oh, God. 504.
- It's Stassi.

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
- What's she say?

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
- She says she's saying that
she can't get through to Katie

33:38.999 --> 33:43.000
and that she knows--she wants
to essentially talk to me.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
So I can relay the message
to Katie.

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- Katie's gotten
all her text messages.

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
- This is a really
exciting time for you,

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
and I'm thinking about
how far you've come, really,

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
in, like, the last two years,

33:55.999 --> 33:56.999
- I took control
of my life.

33:56.999 --> 33:58.999
- When I was friends
with Stassi,

33:58.999 --> 34:00.999
I cannot literally
remember

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
one nice thing
that she ever did for me.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.999
- There's a reason why Stassi
is coming around,

34:07.999 --> 34:10.999
and it's to benefit Stassi.

34:10.999 --> 34:12.999
It's all about her.

34:12.999 --> 34:15.999
- I really do see a lot
of growth in you, I really do.

34:15.999 --> 34:16.999
- I've been able
to reprioritize

34:16.999 --> 34:19.999
and the friend--you know,

34:19.999 --> 34:20.999
for instance,
someone like Stassi,

34:20.999 --> 34:22.999
like, it was eating
things up in my life.

34:22.999 --> 34:25.999
I would not have had time to
focus and do something like this

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
that I've been wanting to do
for so long

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
focusing on someone else,

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
because it always
was about her.

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
- Part of me wants to tell her
to f***ing piss off.

34:33.999 --> 34:35.999
- Then do that.

34:35.999 --> 34:36.999
She would do that
to you.

34:36.999 --> 34:38.999
- Ah...dude,
I don't know.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
- You were just like
a little puppy

34:40.999 --> 34:42.999
kinda snipping
at her heels.

34:42.999 --> 34:43.999
- Yeah.
- I used to see that.

34:43.999 --> 34:45.999
- So I'm proud of you

34:45.999 --> 34:47.999
that you've kind of
come full circle.

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
Stassi suppressed Katie.

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
She kind of told her
what to think.

34:51.999 --> 34:54.999
And now Katie's been
emancipated.

34:54.999 --> 34:55.999
She really is kind of thriving.

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- The night--it's gorgeous.

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
Everything came together,
and I'm so proud of Katie.

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
- Now you're seeing the Katie
that I've seen for years.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
- Yeah!
- I'm a boss bitch.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
- Yeah.
- That's my job.

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
- Everything is--I got
an interesting text

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
from somebody that none of us
have seen in a long time.

35:10.999 --> 35:11.999
- Who's that?

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
Stassi.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
- Stassi?
- Yeah.

35:13.999 --> 35:14.999
I feel like she's trying to

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
ingratiate herself with Katie,

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
and I can't tell if it's sincere
or if there's an angle here.

35:18.999 --> 35:21.999
I'm wary.
- But if she's texting me;

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
I'm not responding,
so now she's texting you?

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
- She'll try anything.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
Schwartzie's such a softie.

35:27.999 --> 35:31.999
I hope that Schwartzie
actually takes a stand

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
and has Katie's back in this.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
If you feel protective
of Katie...

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
- I do, I do.
- Then you should speak up.

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
It's up to you.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
Anyway, you should
be proud of her.

35:40.999 --> 35:41.999
Exactly.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
- Braid looks good.
- Thank you.

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
- Thank you all for coming.

35:48.999 --> 35:49.999
I love you all very much,
but the salon needs to close.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
- Thank you for coming...
- Love you.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
- But everyone clean up
and get the f*** out.

35:56.999 --> 35:59.999
- Come here--look at you!
Gonna parade you around.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.999
- Did I do a good job?
- Good job, buddy.

36:01.999 --> 36:02.999
You did a great job.
- It was a success!

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
- Mm-hmm.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
- And everyone had fun.
- Baby, I'm proud of you.

36:06.999 --> 36:07.999
I mean, um...
- Let's...

36:07.999 --> 36:08.999
- I'm just gonna tell Stassi

36:08.999 --> 36:11.999
that I'll sit down
with her for a second and chat.

36:11.999 --> 36:12.999
- Out of every person
in the world,

36:13.000 --> 36:14.999
I feel like she's the one

36:14.999 --> 36:15.999
that you probably
distaste the most.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
- Yeah, I'm not a fan.

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
- Then why are you going to?
- I don't know.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.999
Maybe there's a little
part of me that's curious

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
just to see if she's sincere
or she's, like, angle shooting--

36:22.999 --> 36:25.999
- I don't think she is sincere.
- I wanna look her in her eyes.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
- I feel like her life
kinda like blew up in flames,

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
and now she's, like,
realizing she was wrong,

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
and I'm sorry,
I was right all along.

36:32.999 --> 36:35.999
- Yeah. I'll be delegating
for you...in a sense.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
- Don't be like,
"Katie misses you too."

36:37.999 --> 36:39.999
- No, no, no.
- And tell her, like,

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
legit how it is.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
If Schwartz really wants
to meet with Stassi,

36:43.999 --> 36:45.999
if he has things
he wants to say,

36:45.999 --> 36:46.999
that's his business.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
Just don't make it about me.

36:48.999 --> 36:49.999
I left the door open
for her.

36:49.999 --> 36:50.999
I had to f***ing
close it.

36:50.999 --> 36:51.999
- You left it wide open.
- It was ridiculous.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
- And way longer
than you should have.

36:53.999 --> 36:54.999
- I know, and so now
that I've closed it,

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
it's unfair that she's trying
to, like, barrel through it.

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
So...you can let her
know that.

37:11.999 --> 37:13.999
- How has life
f***ed me sideways

37:13.999 --> 37:18.999
to the point where I'm sleeping
on my former archenemy's couch?

37:18.999 --> 37:20.999
I mean, let's be honest.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
When I worked at Sur,

37:22.999 --> 37:24.999
I kind of ran sh**,

37:24.999 --> 37:29.999
and now I'm at a place where
I'm willing to suck up my pride

37:29.999 --> 37:33.999
in ways that I have
never done before.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
I've always been
really close to Schwartz.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- I feel like
he reacts to Stassi

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
the same way all guys
react to Stassi--

37:39.999 --> 37:42.999
They love her one minute,
hate her the next.

37:45.999 --> 37:46.999
- I feel like we had
a friendship on our own.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.999
Like I could be around him
so easily.

37:53.999 --> 37:54.999
And I've always loved Schwartz.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
Will you keep them
coming?

38:01.999 --> 38:03.999
- We had a good friendship,
me and Stassi.

38:03.999 --> 38:06.999
When we were all friends and
hanging out on a regular basis,

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
there was so much
good stuff there, you know?

38:08.999 --> 38:11.999
But the last impression
I have of Stassi in my mind

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
is her just being smug.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.999
She really hurt Katie.

38:23.999 --> 38:25.000
- This is awkward
as f***.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.999
- Yeah.

38:26.999 --> 38:29.999
'Cause it's been more
than a f***ing year

38:29.999 --> 38:31.999
since I've seen you
or even heard from you.

38:31.999 --> 38:34.999
Um...yeah.

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
- No, I really
appreciate it.

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:39.999 --> 38:40.999
- 'Cause I know you
don't really want

38:40.999 --> 38:41.999
to be here right now.

38:41.999 --> 38:42.999
- No.
- I've been drinking

38:42.999 --> 38:44.999
all night long because
I've been

38:44.999 --> 38:45.999
like about to sh**
myself at first.

38:45.999 --> 38:46.999
- Yeah.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.999
All right, so...

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
this is the sort of way
I'm seeing it right now.

38:50.999 --> 38:52.999
So you, Stassi,

38:52.999 --> 38:55.999
you're always
a pain in the ass

38:55.999 --> 38:57.000
and a bitch,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.999
and you were venomous,

38:58.999 --> 39:00.999
and, you know,
all that stuff.

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
But...but...

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
you were also endearing,

39:03.999 --> 39:05.999
and you did it
in a likeable way.

39:05.999 --> 39:09.999
However, over the course
of the past year,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
that endearing buffer
has sort of faded away,

39:12.999 --> 39:14.999
and I feel like what was left
was just like

39:14.999 --> 39:17.999
a smug, bitchy shell
of your former self.

39:17.999 --> 39:20.999
When you severed ties
with Katie,

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
it was so cold
and so rigid,

39:22.999 --> 39:25.999
and you were just so
ruthlessly dismissive

39:25.999 --> 39:28.999
that it was just like--
I mean, it was just disgusting.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.000
And she was so hurt
by that.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.999
You don't understand
how much she cared for you.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
She really f***ing cared
for you, you know?

39:34.999 --> 39:37.999
And she left the door open
for a long time,

39:37.999 --> 39:39.999
and I feel like you're kinda
crawling back right now

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
and you're kinda
peeking in...

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
and you're wondering
what's going on.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.999
You're like,
"Hey, guys...remember me?

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
"Stassi. Just seeing
what you guys are up to.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
My life's kinda gone
to sh**."

39:48.999 --> 39:51.999
You need some humility and some
perspective in your life.

39:51.999 --> 39:54.999
Like, your ego
got overinflated,

39:54.999 --> 39:56.999
Even if you weren't
aware of it, it did.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
You were a f***ing bitch!

40:00.999 --> 40:01.999
- Did I, like,
kill your dog?

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
- Hey, don't get
defensive.

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
'Cause if you try to
rationalize too much

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
and get defensive,
I'm gonna leave.

40:07.999 --> 40:08.999
- I am the type of person

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
that, in order to
protect myself,

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
if you hurt me,
I cut you out.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
I've done that with
everybody in my life.

40:13.999 --> 40:14.999
- With shocking ease.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Yes. And that is
a fault of mine.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.000
Yes.
- Okay.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.999
- And I am now
realizing this

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
and I have been
thinking about it.

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
- Well, just so you know,
Katie not responding to you,

40:25.999 --> 40:28.999
it's not like a...it's not like
a calculated thing.

40:28.999 --> 40:30.999
She's not like, "No, f*** her,
man, f*** it!"

40:30.999 --> 40:32.999
She's not like that.
It's not like that.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
It's even worse.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
It's like...
it's an indifference,

40:36.999 --> 40:40.999
which is like
worst-case scenario.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
Stass.

40:51.999 --> 40:53.999
- I didn't just cut her
off for no reason.

40:53.999 --> 40:54.999
I didn't know what
else to do.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
It was how I deal
with things.

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
- Okay. Okay--

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
- I didn't know
what else to do.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
Why does everybody else
get forgiven?

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
- Just wait, wait, wait--
- Why does everybody else

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
get forgiven for things?
I don't understand.

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
- They have redeeming
qualities, and they have--

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
- Oh, I don't have
any redeeming qualities?

41:07.999 --> 41:09.999
- Well, no you disappeared...
- Am I just a complete dick?

41:09.999 --> 41:12.999
for a year and told us
all to f*** off.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
What do you want here?

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
- I just wanna be
her friend.

41:16.999 --> 41:19.999
Like I just want to
be able to, like, call her.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
Like, I wanna be able
to sit on the couch

41:21.999 --> 41:22.999
and do nothing.

41:22.999 --> 41:23.999
- That's like the best part

41:23.999 --> 41:26.999
of friendships
and relationships, yes?

41:26.999 --> 41:29.000
And what did you--what did
you throw that away for?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.999
- I actually didn't
value history...

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
and that has been something
that's actually, like,

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
been crossing my mind.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
- Whoa, look at you.
- No one forced me

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
to do anything.

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
- Can I get a witness?
- No.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- I need a witness
right here.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
- I don't like it.
- She's being humble.

41:44.999 --> 41:47.999
We need a witness.
- It's really annoying.

41:47.999 --> 41:49.999
- I'm not gonna try
to undermine

41:49.999 --> 41:50.999
everything that just happened--
we had a good conversation.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.999
I don't hate you.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.999
Our engagement party's
coming up,

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
and I would love
for you to come.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
- When is that?
- It's in, like, three weeks.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
- I'm hoping to actually
talk to her

42:00.999 --> 42:02.999
at some point before then.

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
- Oh, yeah, you're dreaming.
That's not gonna happen.

42:04.999 --> 42:07.999
- ♪ I stand before you ♪

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- Okay, okay.

42:08.999 --> 42:11.999
- ♪ A little wiser ♪

42:11.999 --> 42:14.999
- I just really hope
that having you speak to me,

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
that it, like...

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
that you believe me...

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
- I'm trying.
- And that you think

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
I'm being sincere.
- I'm trying over here.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
- ♪ I've already gone ♪

42:25.999 --> 42:29.999
♪ Oh-whoa-oh ♪

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
- I invited her
to the engagement party.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
- No, No.
- I was so...

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
- No, Tom--

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
- If I can get, like,

42:40.999 --> 42:41.999
the people that
have been hating me

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
to actually believe me,

42:43.999 --> 42:46.999
then I feel like I'm one
step closer to Katie.

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
This is gonna suck.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- If you can't commit
to doing the sangria,

42:51.999 --> 42:52.999
we worked out

42:52.999 --> 42:55.999
just like a big,
bloody wussy pussy.

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- That was a pussy-ass
f***ing move.

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
I have bet everything
on this guy.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
Get a f***ing job.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- Stop acting like you're
the number one f***ing guy

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
in this group, man.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
I'm the number one guy
in this group.

43:06.999 --> 43:07.999
- Are you f***ing
kidding me, Jax?

43:07.999 --> 43:10.999
Your ego is just gonna try
and pull f***ing rank on me?

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
That's f***ed up, man!
