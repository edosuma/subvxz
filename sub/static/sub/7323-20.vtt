WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.404
NO, I JUST--
I JUST WANT TO SAY,

00:03.404 --> 00:05.406
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE CLINICAL TRIAL.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.007
I'VE BEEN READING

00:07.007 --> 00:09.009
IN THE "NEW ENGLAND
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE"...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.282
(Meredith)
GERMS, DISEASE, TOXINS...

00:11.282 --> 00:15.146
OUR BODIES ENCOUNTER DANGERS
ALL THE TIME,

00:15.146 --> 00:18.249
JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE...

00:18.249 --> 00:20.151
♪♪♪

00:20.151 --> 00:22.393
HIDDEN.

00:22.393 --> 00:24.125
(indistinct conversations)

00:24.125 --> 00:26.127
WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT,

00:26.127 --> 00:29.600
YOUR BODY IS
CONSTANTLY PROTECTING ITSELF.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.163
(indistinct conversations
continue)

00:32.163 --> 00:34.034
(tinkles)

00:34.034 --> 00:36.107
I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.439
(man)
WHY IS THE SPERM DONOR HERE?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.441
I THOUGHT TONIGHT
WAS A FAMILY DINNER.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.543
DAD, I--

00:42.543 --> 00:44.145
TO TWO EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN--

00:44.145 --> 00:46.717
MAY YOUR LIVES BE OVERFILLED
WITH LOVE, HAPPINESS, AND JOY.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.180
TO CALLIE AND ARIZONA--

00:49.180 --> 00:52.253
THE MOTHERS OF MY CHILD.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.255
(laughs)
OH, FOR GOD SAKE. I--

00:54.255 --> 00:56.457
OH, DANIEL. CHEERS.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.058
(speaking indistinctly)

00:58.058 --> 01:00.461
YES. THERE WE GO.
(laughs)

01:00.461 --> 01:02.793
DO YOU EVER GO BY ANYTHING
OTHER THAN COLONEL, COLONEL?

01:02.793 --> 01:05.366
THE COLONEL.
(chuckles)

01:05.366 --> 01:08.068
ACTUALLY, UM...
WE FORGOT TO SAY GRACE.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.402
SAY WHAT?
YEAH, WE SHOULD--WE SHOULD
SAY GRACE BEFORE WE EAT.

01:11.402 --> 01:14.605
OF COURSE. SHAME ON US.
FORK DOWN,THECOLONEL.

01:14.605 --> 01:17.208
MOM, YOU WANT TO LEAD?

01:17.208 --> 01:19.680
BLESS US, OH, LORD,
AND THESE THY GIFTS...
EVERY TIME YOU BLINK YOUR EYE,

01:19.680 --> 01:22.213
YOU WASH AWAY THOUSANDS
OF UNWANTED MICROBES.

01:22.213 --> 01:24.485
BREATHE IN TOO MUCH
UNWANTED POLLEN AND YOU SNEEZE.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.217
(all) AMEN.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.119
(Sofia crying)
OH.

01:28.119 --> 01:30.761
I'LL GET HER. I'LL GO.
I'LL GO GET HER.
(Arizona) THANKS.

01:30.761 --> 01:34.625
EXCUSE ME.
(Carlos) ARIZONA, WE SAT
NEXT TO A CHARMING YOUNG MAN

01:34.625 --> 01:36.627
ON THE PLANE TODAY,
AND HE SAID

01:36.627 --> 01:39.130
HE WAS GOING WITH HIS PARTNER
TO MARCH IN A PARADE.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.631
FOR PRIDE?

01:40.631 --> 01:44.104
YEAH. THOSE ARE GOOD.
MM.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.776
(singsongy) MM-HMM.
THE BODY KNOWS

01:45.776 --> 01:48.679
WHEN IT'S ENCOUNTERED SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T BELONG.

01:48.679 --> 01:51.642
OH. SHE COULDN'T BE CUTER
IF SHE TRIED.
(Arizona and Carlos laugh)

01:51.642 --> 01:54.845
MOM, YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO HOLD HER YET.
THE BODY DETECTS THE INVADER,

01:54.845 --> 01:57.388
IT RELEASES
ITS WHITE BLOOD CELLS...

01:57.388 --> 02:00.391
NO, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, THOUGH. I'M EATING.

02:00.391 --> 02:02.793
(Sofia coos)

02:02.793 --> 02:06.427
AND IT ATTACKS.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.359
THIS IS ZOLA.
SHE'S 6 MONTHS OLD,

02:08.359 --> 02:11.332
BORN WITH SPINA BIFIDA...
ADORABLE AFRICAN CHILDREN,

02:11.332 --> 02:14.235
SHAMELESS EGO STROKING--
KAREV IS A GENIUS.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.507
YEAH, HE'S SINGLE-HANDEDLY
STEALING CHIEF RESIDENT

02:16.507 --> 02:19.210
OUT FROM UNDER ALL OF US,
AND WE'RE HELPING HIM DO IT.

02:19.210 --> 02:22.213
I MEAN, WE CAN'T EXACTLY
REFUSE TO TREAT LITTLE SICK KIDS

02:22.213 --> 02:24.175
WITHOUT MAKING OURSELVES
LOOK BAD.

02:24.175 --> 02:26.177
OH, HE IS A GENIUS.
OR... (speaks African dialect).

02:26.177 --> 02:28.349
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
IN SWAHILI.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.351
(Alex) ...HIS SPINE TO PREVENT
ANY FURTHER BRAIN DAMAGE...

02:30.351 --> 02:32.483
WELL, HE ONLY HAS A SHOT
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BENCHED.

02:32.483 --> 02:34.885
THE PLAYING FIELD HAS BEEN
LEVELED. YOU'RE ALL WELCOME.

02:34.885 --> 02:37.928
MY ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL
KICKS AFRICAN-ORPHAN ASS.

02:37.928 --> 02:40.931
IT KICKS ALL OF YOUR ASSES.
DO YOU WANT TO
KEEP IT DOWN BACK THERE?

02:40.931 --> 02:43.734
I'M TRYING TO LISTEN
TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE

02:43.734 --> 02:46.497
THE NEXT CHIEF RESIDENT
TALKING.
BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT
TO SAY THANK YOU

02:46.497 --> 02:48.499
TO ALL OF YOU
FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION.

02:48.499 --> 02:52.243
IT, UH, TRULY MEANS
MORE THAN I COULD SAY.

02:52.243 --> 02:55.346
SLOW CLAP. THEY'RE GIVING HIM
THE SLOW CLAP. COME ON.

02:55.346 --> 02:58.679
I'M NOT GIVING HIM
THE SLOW CLAP. RIDICULOUS.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.412
OKAY, I WANT TO
PERSONALLY CHECK

03:01.412 --> 03:02.813
THE INCISION SITES,

03:02.813 --> 03:04.715
ANY WEIGHT FLUCTUATIONS,

03:04.715 --> 03:06.717
THE PATIENTS' GLUCOSE LEVELS.

03:06.717 --> 03:09.460
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CLEANED THESE CAGES, AVERY?

03:09.460 --> 03:12.323
A CLEAN CAGE MEANS
A LOWER INFECTION RATE,

03:12.323 --> 03:16.327
WHICH MEANS F.D.A. APPROVAL,
UNDERSTOOD?
CAGES. I GOT IT, SIR.

03:16.327 --> 03:18.329
(crying)

03:18.329 --> 03:20.301
MAKENA? HI, I'M DR. SHEPHERD.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.303
OF COURSE,
YOU KNOW DR. KAREV.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.605
(continues crying)
WE'RE HERE TO TAKE A LOOK
AT ZOLA TODAY.

03:24.605 --> 03:28.909
(clears throat) UH, SOMETIMES
BABIES WITH SPINA BIFIDA

03:28.909 --> 03:31.882
CAN DEVELOP
CHIARI MALFORMATION.
IT CAUSES FLUID BUILD-UP
IN THE BRAIN.

03:31.882 --> 03:34.485
IT COULD BE PRETTY
UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT SOMETIMES,

03:34.485 --> 03:37.348
IF YOU ADJUST THE PATIENT'S
HEAD POSITION...
(Zola babbling)

03:37.348 --> 03:39.390
IT HELPS RELIEVE
THE PRESSURE.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.622
LET ME SEE THIS.
LET ME SEE THIS FACE.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.524
WE'VE HAD HER
AT THE ORPHANAGE

03:43.524 --> 03:46.257
SINCE SHE WAS 2 MONTHS OLD.
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

03:46.257 --> 03:48.799
SHE'S STOPPED CRYING
SINCE I CAN REMEMBER.
LET'S JUST RUN AN M.R.I.
AND CHECK TO SEE

03:48.799 --> 03:50.861
IF SHE HAS A CHIARI MALFORMATION
OR HYDROCEPHALUS.

03:50.861 --> 03:53.764
IF IT'S POSITIVE,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A SHUNT,

03:53.764 --> 03:55.366
DRAIN THE FLUID.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.468
IT'S GONNA POSTPONE
THE SPINAL SURGERY,

03:57.468 --> 04:00.711
BUT I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH IT.
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

04:00.711 --> 04:04.415
(laughs) SHE CAN KEEP
THAT LAMPLIGHT.

04:04.415 --> 04:05.816
(coos)

04:05.816 --> 04:07.818
SEFU, I WILL BE REPAIRING

04:07.818 --> 04:10.621
YOUR BROTHER'S HEART DEFECT
TOMORROW WHILE DR. SLOAN,

04:10.621 --> 04:14.685
OUR HEAD OF PLASTICS, HE WILL
CONSTRUCT KONDO A NEW STERNUM.

04:14.685 --> 04:19.390
(speaking African dialect)

04:22.863 --> 04:25.396
HE WANTS TO KNOW, IF HE DIES,

04:25.396 --> 04:27.868
COULD WE WAIT
TO TELL THE FAMILY AT HOME.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.870
OUR SISTER'S BIRTHDAY
IS TOMORROW,

04:29.870 --> 04:32.272
AND HE DOESN'T WANT
TO RUIN IT.

04:34.405 --> 04:38.449
WE ARE GONNA TAKE
REALLYGOOD CARE OF YOU. OKAY?

04:38.449 --> 04:42.282
AND YOU ARE NOT GONNA RUIN
YOUR SISTER'S BIRTHDAY.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.986
WE HAVE TO LOOK
AT HIS CHEST, OKAY?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.462
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

04:51.462 --> 04:55.466
(heartbeat pounding)

04:55.466 --> 04:56.767
(monitor beeps)

04:56.767 --> 04:58.429
WOW.

04:58.429 --> 05:00.901
(siren wails)

05:00.901 --> 05:03.504
(Owen) SIR.
(man) GET OFF ME!
I TOLD YOU THAT I'M FINE!

05:03.504 --> 05:05.706
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.
(sighs) SIR, PLEASE.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.579
GET-- (grunting)
SIR, IF YOU CONTINUE TO TRY
TO GET OUT OF BED,

05:08.579 --> 05:11.081
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RESTRAIN YOU.
GET OFF ME. GET OFF--AAH!

05:11.081 --> 05:14.985
B-52 COCKTAIL.
OUGHT TO CALM HIM DOWN.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.518
OKAY, LISTEN, I NEED
TO GET BACK IN THE RACE

05:17.518 --> 05:19.720
FOR CHIEF RESIDENT.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.993
I NEED IN ON TEDDY'S
PENTALOGY OF CANTRELL PATIENT.

05:22.993 --> 05:25.456
THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE.
SHE IS STILL SHUTTING ME OUT.

05:25.456 --> 05:28.729
CAN'T YOU TALK TO HER?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON ROBBINS' SERVICE TODAY.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.602
ISN'T SHE ON THAT CASE, TOO?
YEAH, BUT THAT JUST PUTS ME,

05:31.602 --> 05:33.604
LIKE, INCHES AWAY
FROM SOME OTHER RESIDENT

05:33.604 --> 05:35.606
DOING THE MOST AMAZING
CARDIO PROCEDURE IMAGINABLE

05:35.606 --> 05:37.868
WHILE I JUST STAND THERE
AND... SUCTION. IT'S TORTURE.

05:37.868 --> 05:40.811
(exhales deeply)
YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

05:40.811 --> 05:41.942
(clicks)

05:41.942 --> 05:43.814
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT,

05:43.814 --> 05:45.816
FOR HAVING BETTER JUDGMENT
THAN TEDDY,

05:45.816 --> 05:47.448
FOR SAVING CALLIE'S LIFE?

05:47.448 --> 05:50.080
THERE'S A WEDDING TOMORROW
BECAUSE OF ME.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.424
YOUR APOLOGY
COULD USE SOME WORK.
YOU ASKED ME HOW TO
GET BACK IN WITH TEDDY.

05:53.424 --> 05:56.557
I'M TELLING YOU HOW.
UGH.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.559
ASHA IS 10 YEARS OLD.
SHE SUSTAINED INTERNAL INJURIES

05:58.559 --> 06:00.631
SIX YEARS AGO
FROM AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.

06:00.631 --> 06:02.493
SHE HAS
MULTIPLE ENTEROTOMIES--

06:02.493 --> 06:04.495
AND THERE ARE
SOME STRICTURES THERE

06:04.495 --> 06:05.896
AND SOME ASCITES.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.899
SHE HAS NOT HEALED PROPERLY.
BOY, THIS COMPLICATES THINGS.

06:08.899 --> 06:11.502
AS DOES THE FACT
THAT SHE'S H.I.V. POSITIVE.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.804
SHE'S LIVING WITH A.I.D.S.

06:13.804 --> 06:16.006
(April) HELLO.

06:16.006 --> 06:20.380
(speaking African dialect)
APRIL.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.112
UH, DON'T BE SCARED.

06:22.112 --> 06:25.456
UM...
(speaks African dialect)

06:25.456 --> 06:27.518
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE NOW, OKAY?

06:27.518 --> 06:29.660
MM.
SO--OH, NO. IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.662
UM, WE'RE--
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

06:31.662 --> 06:34.925
(speaks African dialect)
HELP.

06:34.925 --> 06:37.097
LET'S GET HER ON L.R.
AT MAINTENANCE

06:37.097 --> 06:38.799
AND START
BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.400
UNDERSTAND?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.974
(speaks African dialect)
HELP. HELP.

06:43.974 --> 06:45.806
DR. KEPNER...
UH-HUH.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.078
UM, THE ANTIBIOTICS
AND THE L.R.?

06:48.078 --> 06:50.410
OH, RIGHT.
SORRY, DR. HUNT. RIGHT AWAY.
YOU KNOW, DR. KEPNER.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.813
YEAH.
PERHAPS IF YOU SPENT
A LITTLE MORE TIME

06:52.813 --> 06:54.414
JUST DOING YOUR JOB,

06:54.414 --> 06:57.147
A LITTLE LESS TIME LEARNING
THE NEW LANGUAGES,

06:57.147 --> 06:59.850
YOUR ATTENDINGS WOULDN'T
HAVE TO REPEAT THEMSELVES.
(taps tabletop)

06:59.850 --> 07:01.692
(elevator bell dings)

07:01.692 --> 07:03.454
HOLD, PLEASE.

07:03.454 --> 07:06.927
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:06.927 --> 07:10.701
(people speaking indistinctly)

07:10.701 --> 07:12.102
(door closes)

07:12.102 --> 07:15.105
(motor whirring)

07:15.105 --> 07:18.038
DR. ALTMAN,
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.971
I AM... SORRY

07:20.971 --> 07:23.113
FOR GOING OVER YOUR HEAD

07:23.113 --> 07:25.115
AND PUTTING YOU
IN A DIFFICULT POSITION

07:25.115 --> 07:27.718
DURING CALLIE'S SURGERY.

07:27.718 --> 07:30.751
I AM SORRY. I-I APOLOGIZE.

07:30.751 --> 07:34.184
ARE YOU SAYING THIS
BECAUSE YOU MEAN IT

07:34.184 --> 07:38.028
OR BECAUSE YOU WANT BACK
ON MY SERVICE?

07:39.890 --> 07:42.663
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.865
YES, IT MATTERS.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.568
(elevator bell dings)

07:47.568 --> 07:49.500
(sighs deeply)

08:00.110 --> 08:01.752
HERE YOU GO.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.153
THANK YOU. OH.

08:03.153 --> 08:05.756
I, UH, I PUT TOGETHER
A SCHEDULE TO, UH,

08:05.756 --> 08:07.758
TO HELP
WITH THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

08:07.758 --> 08:10.160
AH. OH, BY THE HOUR,
MILITARY TIME--WOW.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.892
THANK YOU, COLONEL.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.025
AND I PICKED UP
A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR SOFIA.

08:15.025 --> 08:18.068
LOOK AT THE LITTLE ROSEBUDS.
(laughs)
OKAY, MOM, BABY CLOTHES LATER.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.070
WEDDING REHEARSAL NOW.
I'VE GOT 20 MINUTES

08:20.070 --> 08:22.072
BEFORE I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:22.072 --> 08:25.005
DAD, WHERE'S THE MOMENT
OF SILENCE?
TIME IS TIGHT, ARIZONA.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.507
I COULD NOT FIND A PLACE
IN THE CEREMONY FOR IT.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.040
WELL, WE HAVE TO LIGHT A CANDLE
FOR TIMOTHY. IT'S TWO MINUTES.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.182
(lowered voice) TIMOTHY?
(whispers) OH, HER BROTHER.

08:32.182 --> 08:33.944
AH.
DAD...

08:33.944 --> 08:35.686
SWEETIE, DON'T PUSH IT.

08:35.686 --> 08:37.688
OKAY, SO THE TABLE
IS THE ALTAR,

08:37.688 --> 08:41.191
AND THE LAMP IS...

08:41.191 --> 08:42.793
FATHER BROOKS.

08:42.793 --> 08:43.924
MM-HMM.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.956
YOUR PRIEST?
(clears throat) MINISTER.

08:45.956 --> 08:48.899
NO, HE'S NOT CATHOLIC, BUT HE
PRACTICES AT A VERY BIG CHURCH.

08:48.899 --> 08:51.031
IT'S--IT'S OLD AND DRAFTY.
IT'S--YOU'LL LIKE IT.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.904
IT'S VERY CHURCHY.
I SEE.

08:53.904 --> 08:56.907
OKAY, MRS. TORRES, YOU'LL BE
OVER HERE IN THE FRONT ROW.

08:56.907 --> 08:58.909
OKAY, AND I KNOW
WHERE YOU WANT ME.

08:58.909 --> 09:02.042
RIGHT BACK HERE TO WALK
MY LITTLE GIRL DOWN THE AISLE.
(laughs)

09:02.042 --> 09:06.046
SORRY. SORRY.
SURGERY RAN LONG, BUT I'M HERE.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.619
I MADE IT.
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

09:08.619 --> 09:11.051
THAT IS NOT
WHERE YOU WILL BE.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.223
OH, THIS IS YOUR SPOT?
SORRY.

09:13.223 --> 09:15.225
(Carlos) HEY, MARK.

09:15.225 --> 09:17.688
WHY DON'T YOU STAND OVER HERE
NEXT TO ME?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.636
(man speaks indistinctly)

09:25.636 --> 09:28.568
AT LEAST ONE OF MY
FATHERS-IN-LAW DOESN'T HATE ME.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.100
YOU'RE SOFIA'S FATHER.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.103
I LOVE SOFIA, SO I'M GONNA
AT LEAST TRY TO LIKE YOU.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.205
BUT IF YOU CALL ME
YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW AGAIN,

09:35.205 --> 09:37.708
I'LL KNOCK YOU OUT.
(Callie)OKAY.

09:37.708 --> 09:39.710
SO ARIZONA
WALKS DOWN THE AISLE FIRST.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.852
(clears throat)

09:41.852 --> 09:44.855
(laughs) THERE SHE GOES.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.116
(laughs)

09:46.116 --> 09:48.819
ALL RIGHT. AND THEN I GO.

09:48.819 --> 09:50.590
MM.
OKAY.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
AND THEN
I HAND THE BOUQUET TO--

09:53.593 --> 09:56.997
MOM... CAN I HAND YOU
THE BOUQUET? (laughs)

09:56.997 --> 10:00.000
ACTUALLY, I, UM, I-I NEED
TO USE THE POWDER ROOM.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.832
EXCUSE ME.

10:01.832 --> 10:03.734
(car alarm beeps, door closes)

10:03.734 --> 10:06.306
(car alarm chirps)
WELL, I'D LIKE SOME BOUQUET TIME
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.339
I HAVEN'T HAD
ENOUGH BOUQUET TIME TODAY.
(laughs)

10:09.339 --> 10:12.042
I MEAN, YOU'D THINK BEING ON
THE CHIEF'S RESEARCH PROJECT

10:12.042 --> 10:14.044
WOULD HELP
IN THE RACE FOR CHIEF RESIDENT.

10:14.044 --> 10:16.647
YOU MIGHT EVEN THINK
IT'D MAKE ME A CONTENDER.

10:16.647 --> 10:19.389
ONLY I'M NOT SAVING LITTLE KIDS
OR PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

10:19.389 --> 10:22.152
I'M CLEANING UP MOUSE POOP.
CAN YOU HAND ME THAT BASIN?

10:22.152 --> 10:24.154
WANNA HEAR MY CONVERSATION
WITH THE CHIEF EVERY MORNING?

10:24.154 --> 10:26.156
"AVERY, HOW ARE THE MICE?"
"OH, THEY'RE FINE, CHIEF.

10:26.156 --> 10:27.758
"THEY'RE RUNNING
ON THEIR WHEELS.

10:27.758 --> 10:29.860
THEY'RE EATING THEIR CHEESE."
IF I WORKED AT A PET STORE,

10:29.860 --> 10:31.902
I'D BE EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH
BY NOW.

10:31.902 --> 10:34.805
BUT I'M A SURGEON,
BABYSITTING A BUNCH OF MICE.
UNTIL YOU GET F.D.A. APPROVAL,

10:34.805 --> 10:37.207
OKAY, WHICH, I'M SURE YOU'RE
GONNA BE WORKING ON HUMANS

10:37.207 --> 10:38.939
ANY DAY NOW.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.671
NOW GRAB ME ANOTHER PLUM.

10:40.671 --> 10:42.843
WHY ARE YOU PEELING
THESE THINGS APART ANYWAY?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.845
(sighs) I'M PRACTICING.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.847
SINCE MY KID'S SKIN

10:46.847 --> 10:49.649
HAS GROWN DIRECTLY
ONTO THE HEART MUSCLE,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.382
I'M GONNA BE HELPING TEDDY
REMOVE THE ADHESIONS

10:52.382 --> 10:55.385
WITHOUT PUNCTURING THE HEART.

10:55.385 --> 10:56.957
(crunches)

10:56.957 --> 10:59.429
HEY!
DON'T EAT MY ADHESIONS.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.732
(laughs)
OH, GROSS.

11:01.732 --> 11:03.734
OKAY, OKAY, LOOK,
I NEED 20 GOOD REASONS

11:03.734 --> 11:06.136
WHY I SHOULDN'T LET CRISTINA
BACK ON MY SERVICE TODAY,

11:06.136 --> 11:08.138
BECAUSE I AM READY TO BUCKLE.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.140
I HAVE GOT
A REALLY COMPLICATED CASE,

11:10.140 --> 11:12.142
AND I COULD USE
HER SKILLS TODAY,

11:12.142 --> 11:14.745
SO 20 REASONS,
RIGHT NOW, PLEASE.
I DON'T HAVE ONE REASON.

11:14.745 --> 11:17.147
UGH.
I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT HER
BACK ON YOUR SERVICE.

11:17.147 --> 11:18.749
NO.NO.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.751
THAT WOULD BE THE WORST THING
THAT I COULD DO.

11:20.751 --> 11:22.753
I MEAN, THAT J--THAT WON'T
TEACH HER A THING.

11:22.753 --> 11:24.755
SHE WENT OVER YOUR HEAD
IN A SURGERY.

11:24.755 --> 11:26.156
YES, THAT WAS BAD FORM,

11:26.156 --> 11:28.819
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING A LITTLE BIT HARSH?

11:28.819 --> 11:31.221
HARSH? OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
SHE WENT OVER MY HEAD TO YOU,

11:31.221 --> 11:32.963
AND YOU ENABLED
THAT BEHAVIOR,

11:32.963 --> 11:34.965
WHICH YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.697
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS,
CRISTINA IS DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.800
SHE GOT LUCKY.
CALLIE SURVIVED THAT PROCEDURE,

11:39.800 --> 11:42.172
BUT IT JUST AS EASILY
COULD'VE BEEN DISASTROUS.

11:42.172 --> 11:45.906
CRISTINA GOT LUCKY.
SHE DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.079
SHE THINKS SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE'S RIGHT.

11:49.079 --> 11:51.782
AND THAT IS NOT BEING
A GOOD DOCTOR.

11:51.782 --> 11:53.944
THAT IS DANGEROUS.
TELL HER THAT.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.947
INSTEAD OF JUST SHUTTING
HER OUT, TELL HERTHAT.
THERE'S NO TELLING
CRISTINA YANG ANYTHING.

11:56.947 --> 11:58.488
SHE HAS TO LEARN IT.

11:58.488 --> 12:01.892
AND UNTIL THEN, I AM OKAY
BEING THE BAD GUY.

12:01.892 --> 12:04.324
I CAN HANDLE HER
BEING ANGRY AT ME.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.798
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT SHE CAN HANDLE SOMETHING

12:07.798 --> 12:09.930
LIKE KILLING CALLIE TORRES?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.331
(Zola fussing)

12:11.331 --> 12:14.404
(Alex) SO ZOLA DOESN'T HAVE
A CHIARI MALFORMATION,

12:14.404 --> 12:17.407
BUT SHE DOES HAVE
HYDROCEPHALUS.
OKAY. LET'S BOOK AN O.R. FOR
THE SHUNT RIGHT AWAY, OKAY?

12:17.407 --> 12:20.871
HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?
ANY NEWS?
UGH. I WENT OVER
ALL THE SCREENING TESTS,

12:20.871 --> 12:22.873
BUT YOU NEED TO START LOOKING
AT THE NEXT WAVE

12:22.873 --> 12:24.775
OF PATIENT CHARTS.
NEXT WAVE?

12:24.775 --> 12:27.017
THE ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL. THE FIRST
WAVE OF THE TRIAL IS DONE.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.279
NOW WE'RE GETTING READY
TO TREAT THE NEXT GROUP.

12:29.279 --> 12:32.422
LET ME KNOW
WHEN THE O.R. IS BOOKED.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.885
MER, WHAT'S GOING ON?
DOES HE KNOW WHAT YOU DID?

12:34.885 --> 12:37.457
WHAT DID I DO?
I SAW YOU WITH
THE CLINICAL TRIAL ENVELOPE.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.459
YOU WERE HIDING IT
UNDER YOUR LAB COAT.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.491
LOOK, IF YOU MESSED WITH
THIS TRIAL SOMEHOW,

12:41.491 --> 12:44.064
THIS COULD BE BAD FOR YOU--
LIKE, REALLY BAD.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.197
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WHATEVER YOU DID,
NO MATTER HOW MINOR,

12:47.197 --> 12:49.239
IT INVALIDATES
THE ENTIRE PROJECT.
ALEX--

12:49.239 --> 12:52.442
YOU COULD GET
INTO REAL TROUBLE HERE, MER.

12:52.442 --> 12:54.504
IT'S ILLEGAL TO MESS AROUND
WITH A BLIND TRIAL.

12:54.504 --> 12:57.177
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
SO SHUT UP ABOUT IT.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.111
DR. STARK,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

13:01.111 --> 13:03.113
WELL, IT APPEARS
YOU ALREADY ARE.

13:03.113 --> 13:05.085
I-I HAVE SOME CONCERNS
ABOUT ASHA.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.387
SHE HASN'T EATEN A BITE
OF FOOD SINCE SHE ARRIVED.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.090
ALL RIGHT. START HER
ON PARENTERAL NUTRITION.
I WILL,

13:10.090 --> 13:12.092
OBVIOUSLY,
BUT MORE TO THE POINT,

13:12.092 --> 13:15.025
THE FACT THAT SHE'S NOT EATING,
NOT SPEAKING--
KEPNER.

13:15.025 --> 13:18.028
SHE JUST SEEMS REALLY SCARED,
AND I--
YOU KNOW, UNLESS
THE NEXT PIECE OF INFORMATION

13:18.028 --> 13:19.569
FROM YOUR MOUTH

13:19.569 --> 13:21.571
RELIES ON THE WORDS, UH,
"LAB RESULTS"

13:21.571 --> 13:24.905
OR "VITALS" OR "CODE BLUE,"
I DON'T CARE.

13:24.905 --> 13:28.208
YOU PROMISED.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.542
YOU PROMISED ME
THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER,

13:32.542 --> 13:35.185
THAT--THAT
IT WOULDN'T BE WEIRD,

13:35.185 --> 13:38.188
THAT--THAT YOU WOULD TREAT ME
LIKE ANY OTHER RESIDENT.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.993
I ASSURE YOU,
I AM TREATING YOU

13:42.993 --> 13:45.425
EXACTLYTHE WAY
I TREAT OTHER RESIDENTS.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.357
(pagers beeping)

13:47.357 --> 13:49.459
IT'S A 9-1-1 ON ASHA.

13:49.459 --> 13:52.132
(monitor beeping erratically)
ASHA, WHAT'S WRONG?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.064
(moaning)
OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED?

13:54.064 --> 13:57.237
HER BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED OUT.
HER PULSE WAS THREADY.
SOMEBODY NOTIFY HUNT.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.369
(speaks African dialect)
(speaks African dialect)

13:59.369 --> 14:01.511
HELP.

14:01.511 --> 14:04.274
(Robert) OKAY, GET ME FOUR UNITS
OF PACKED CELLS...
(coughing)

14:04.274 --> 14:07.117
DRAW A NEW C.B.C., COAGS,
OPEN UP HER FLUIDS.

14:07.117 --> 14:09.980
KEPNER, GET A GOWN.
I'M FINE. I-I NEED
A CENTRAL LINE KIT RIGHT NOW.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.222
KEPNER.
I'M FINE. I'VE GOT THIS.

14:19.429 --> 14:21.391
(exhales deeply)

14:21.391 --> 14:23.393
TWO MORE DAYS.
MM-HMM.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.996
WE CAN HANDLE TWO MORE DAYS.
AND THEN THEY'LL BE GONE,

14:25.996 --> 14:28.268
AND OUR LIVES
WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.571
NO MORE BRUNCHES.
NO MORE PRAYING.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.905
NO MORE OF MY DAD
CALLING HIMSELF

14:34.905 --> 14:37.177
THECOLONEL.
(laughing)

14:37.177 --> 14:40.180
(laughing) WE JUST NEED
TO FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE...

14:40.180 --> 14:42.182
YEAH.
WHICH IS...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.154
(sighs deeply)

14:44.154 --> 14:46.416
YOU AND I

14:46.416 --> 14:48.288
ARE GETTING MARRIED.

14:53.123 --> 14:55.165
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.567
(whispers)
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED. (laughs)
(laughs)

14:57.567 --> 14:59.569
(Robert)
WE COULDN'T STOP THE BLEEDING,

14:59.569 --> 15:01.301
SO WE RUSHED HER HERE.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.033
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

15:03.033 --> 15:05.575
IT--IT LOOKS LIKE WAX.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

15:05.575 --> 15:07.938
NOBODY HAS,
AT LEAST NOT IN THE STATES.

15:07.938 --> 15:10.380
SHE HAS INTESTINAL T.B.
POOR KID.
THERE'S ADHESIONSEVERYWHERE.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.582
IT'S HARD TO EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

15:12.582 --> 15:16.186
THE PERFORATION'S PRETTY HIGH
AT THE LESSER CURVATURE.
WE SHOULD TREAT IT LIKE
A NORMAL PERF, RIGHT?

15:16.186 --> 15:18.618
AND THEN START
THE ANTI-T.B. MEDS?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.520
THE--THE LESS AGGRESSIVE WE ARE,
THE GREATER CHANCE

15:20.520 --> 15:23.523
WE CAN AVOID SHORT GUT SYNDROME.
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, KEPNER.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.296
(Owen) LET'S START BY LIGATING
THE BLEEDING VESSEL.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.658
(Derek) THE TRICK IS
TO GO IN VERY SLOWLY

15:28.658 --> 15:31.231
UNTIL YOU FEEL A LITTLE GIVE,

15:31.231 --> 15:33.233
AND THEN YOU SHOULD SEE
SOME FLUID.
GOT IT.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.605
VERY NICE. YOU KNOW,
I WASN'T EXACTLY PLEASED

15:35.605 --> 15:38.668
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO BOW OUT
OF THE TRIAL.
YEAH, WELL--

15:38.668 --> 15:41.671
BUT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING WITH
THE KIDS IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.

15:41.671 --> 15:44.174
AND YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT
MEREDITH BEING THE RIGHT PERSON

15:44.174 --> 15:46.476
FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL
ALL ALONG.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.478
I'M IMPRESSED.
YOU ARE REMARKABLY CALM

15:48.478 --> 15:50.480
FOR A BRIDE WHO'S
GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.482
WELL, YOU SHOULD SEE
THE SCHEDULE

15:52.482 --> 15:54.084
THAT MY DAD PUT TOGETHER.

15:54.084 --> 15:56.086
I JUST SHOW UP WHERE I BELONG,
WHEN I BELONG.

15:56.086 --> 15:58.358
IT'S PERFECT. EVERYONE
SHOULD GET MARRIED LIKE THIS.
(cell phone chimes)

15:58.358 --> 16:02.092
(laughs)
WHO IS THAT FROM, HOTTIE HUSBAND
OR HOTTIE BOYFRIEND?

16:02.092 --> 16:05.035
IT'S FROM ANDREW,
WHO IS NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

16:05.035 --> 16:08.098
HE'S JUST, UH, HE'S JUST
MY WEDDING DATE.
UH-HUH, AND DOES
YOUR HOTTIE WEDDING DATE

16:08.098 --> 16:10.240
KNOW ABOUT YOUR HOTTIE HUSBAND?
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING TO KNOW.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.642
I MEAN, ANDREW WILL BE IN TOWN
FOR ANOTHER WEEK,

16:12.642 --> 16:14.644
AND THEN HE'S OFF
TO WHO KNOWS WHERE.

16:14.644 --> 16:17.507
SO I'M JUST ENJOYING WHAT HE HAS
TO OFFER WHILE HE'S OFFERING.

16:17.507 --> 16:19.109
(elevator bell dings)

16:19.109 --> 16:22.082
APPROPRIATE URINARY OUTPUT,
NORMAL WEIGHT READING,

16:22.082 --> 16:24.314
AND... RUNNING ON THE WHEEL.

16:24.314 --> 16:26.656
PATIENT H.,
YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT.

16:26.656 --> 16:29.389
VERY GOOD.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.061
PATIENT I., WHAT CAN I SAY?

16:31.061 --> 16:33.263
APPROPRIATE URINARY OUTPUT.

16:33.263 --> 16:36.526
I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM TALKING
TO MICE LIKE THEY'RE--OH, NO.

16:36.526 --> 16:38.528
NO, NO, NO. MOUSE J.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.130
MOUSE J.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.102
(siren wails)

16:42.102 --> 16:45.535
OKAY, SO JUST PRETEND
MY HOODIE'S A GOWN.

16:45.535 --> 16:47.277
OKAY?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.081
AND...

16:51.081 --> 16:52.482
OPEN YOUR EYES.

16:52.482 --> 16:55.115
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:55.115 --> 16:57.747
(laughs) I HAD IT MADE
TO LOOK LIKE YOURS.

16:57.747 --> 17:01.321
I-I CAN SEE THAT.
I HAVE LOVED THIS PICTURE
SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

17:01.321 --> 17:04.023
AND I JUST WANTED
TO SURPRISE YOU.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.096
I... IT'S--DO YOU LIKE IT?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.602
OKAY, WHAT, MOM? (sighs)

17:12.602 --> 17:15.765
WHATDON'TYOU LIKE?

17:15.765 --> 17:18.608
WELL, N-NOTHING, NOTHING.
IT'S...

17:18.608 --> 17:20.710
IT'S LOVELY.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.174
LOVELY.

17:24.174 --> 17:27.117
THAT'S... IT?

17:27.117 --> 17:29.749
WHAT ELSE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SAY?
OH, I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.751
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
BENDING OVER BACKWARDS

17:31.751 --> 17:34.624
SINCE YOU FIRST GOT HERE JUST TO
MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE.

17:34.624 --> 17:38.188
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME.
I'M GETTING MARRIED
IN A CHURCH FOR YOU.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.190
DON'T YOU DARE IMPLY
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING

17:40.190 --> 17:43.533
ABOUT A WEDDING
TO A WOMAN OR...

17:43.533 --> 17:46.266
A BABY OUT OF WEDLOCK
THAT'S FOR ME.

17:49.339 --> 17:52.071
WOW.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.343
OKAY.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.405
(sighs)

17:55.405 --> 17:58.778
SO WHAT BOTHERS YOU MORE,
MY BASTARD CHILD

17:58.778 --> 18:00.510
OR MY LESBIAN FIANCéE?

18:00.510 --> 18:02.252
YOU'RE A LAWYER, MOM.

18:02.252 --> 18:05.155
YOU'RE OUT IN THE WORLD.
YOU KNOW OTHER GAY PEOPLE.

18:05.155 --> 18:07.157
YOUR SECRETARY'S GAY.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.823
(voice breaks)
I'M YOUR DAUGHTER.

18:13.823 --> 18:17.597
DO YOU KNOW
HOW DEVASTATING IT IS

18:17.597 --> 18:20.270
TO RAISE A CHILD

18:20.270 --> 18:23.133
AND TO LOVE A CHILD

18:23.133 --> 18:26.176
AND KNOW YOU WON'T SEE
THAT CHILD IN HEAVEN?

18:26.176 --> 18:29.239
(crying) OH, MOM.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.341
YOU ARE NOT A BRIDE.

18:31.341 --> 18:34.414
AND I AM NOT THE MOTHER
OF A BRIDE.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.815
AND THIS... (blows air)

18:35.815 --> 18:37.487
(chuckles)

18:37.487 --> 18:41.591
TH-THIS--THIS ISN'T
YOUR WEDDING.

18:41.591 --> 18:42.722
(whimpers)

18:42.722 --> 18:44.624
IT ISN'T RIGHT.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.126
I'M SORRY.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.758
I CAN'T BE HERE.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.401
I JUST CAN'T.

18:51.401 --> 18:53.203
(sniffles)

19:03.373 --> 19:06.145
(people speaking indistinctly)

19:06.145 --> 19:08.248
SEFU...

19:08.248 --> 19:10.250
DIDN'T THEY GET YOU A COT

19:10.250 --> 19:12.652
SO YOU COULD STAY
WITH YOUR BROTHER TONIGHT?

19:12.652 --> 19:14.424
I CAN'T SLEEP.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.295
BACK HOME...

19:25.295 --> 19:28.167
I HAVE ALL OF THESE SISTERS,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.799
BUT KONDO...

19:29.799 --> 19:33.573
HE'S MY ONLY BROTHER.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.606
AND...

19:36.606 --> 19:39.479
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HIM.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.312
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

19:42.312 --> 19:43.853
I KNOW.

19:43.853 --> 19:45.855
(inhales)

19:45.855 --> 19:47.787
(exhales)

19:51.461 --> 19:54.294
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

19:54.294 --> 19:56.326
YOU'VE APPARENTLY
STOPPED ANSWERING YOUR PAGES

19:56.326 --> 19:59.198
IN ORDER TO, WHAT,
JOIN THE KITCHEN STAFF?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.200
I NEED
THOSE POST-OP REPORTS.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.202
WET-TO-DRY DRESSING APPLIED
IN 18-10.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.605
VITALS STABLE IN YOUR
CROHN'S PATIENT, POST-OP.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.607
YOU WERE EXPOSED
TO H.I.V.-POSITIVE BLOOD.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.380
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE
CHECKED YOURSELF FOR CUTS.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.483
I'M A DOCTOR. WE GET EXPOSED
TO THINGS ALL THE TIME.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.345
I KNOW PROPER PROTOCOL.

20:15.345 --> 20:17.347
AND THE STICKY
YELLOW MESS HERE,

20:17.347 --> 20:19.889
THIS TOOK PRIORITY OVER
REPORTING BACK TO ME BECAUSE--

20:19.889 --> 20:21.891
THIS STICKY YELLOW MESS
IS NSIMA.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.623
IT'S A MAIZE PORRIDGE,

20:23.623 --> 20:26.626
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE A STAPLE
IN MOST EAST-AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.898
I FOUND THE RECIPE ONLINE.

20:28.898 --> 20:30.930
I'M NOT SURE WHY ASHA
HASN'T EATEN IN TWO DAYS,

20:30.930 --> 20:33.533
BUT I AM SURE THAT SHE'S
NOT USED TO EATING

20:33.533 --> 20:35.234
PROCESSED AMERICAN FOOD.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO CARE,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.639
BUT WHEN SHE IS READY TO EAT
AFTER SURGERY,

20:39.639 --> 20:42.642
SHE'S GONNA BE HUNGRY, AND SHE'S
USED TO CORN PORRIDGE.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.644
SO WHILE
I CAN'T MAKE HER TALK,

20:44.644 --> 20:47.246
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THE FACT THAT SHE IS SICK,

20:47.246 --> 20:48.778
THAT SHE HAS ADVANCED T.B.,

20:48.778 --> 20:51.421
THAT SHE IS A 10 YEAR OLD
LIVING WITH A.I.D.S.,

20:51.421 --> 20:52.822
I CAN DO THIS.

20:52.822 --> 20:55.625
I CAN MAKE MY PATIENT
SOMETHING SHE MIGHT EAT.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.628
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE MORE INSULTS
FOR ME, DR. STARK,

20:58.628 --> 21:00.730
I'M A LITTLE BUSY NOW
MAKING PORRIDGE.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.964
I-I TRIED TO REASON
WITH HER.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.696
SHE WON'T LISTEN.

21:06.696 --> 21:08.698
SHE'S JUST SITTING
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE CAR.

21:08.698 --> 21:10.300
I DON'T... (sighs)

21:10.300 --> 21:12.302
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, SWEETHEART.

21:12.302 --> 21:14.444
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

21:14.444 --> 21:16.576
DADDY, YOU NEED TO GO.
OKAY?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.578
GO? I-I CAN'T--
I'M NOT LEAVING--

21:18.578 --> 21:20.850
YOU HAVE TO GO, OKAY,
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

21:20.850 --> 21:22.582
I WILL START CRYING,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.584
AND THEN THAT WILL
MAKE YOU FEEL BAD,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.887
AND THEN I WILL FEEL WORSE,
SO YOU... HAVE TO GO.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.989
(whispers) OKAY?

21:33.993 --> 21:35.395
OKAY.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.296
YEAH.

21:39.869 --> 21:41.671
(door opens)

21:41.671 --> 21:43.072
(door closes)

21:45.304 --> 21:48.438
IS THERE ANY MILK
OVER THERE?

21:48.438 --> 21:50.079
(refrigerator door closes)
(crunching)

21:50.079 --> 21:52.942
ALEX,
IS THERE ANY MORE MILK?
(continues crunching)

21:52.942 --> 21:55.545
SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO ME NOW, IS THAT IT?

21:55.545 --> 21:57.547
YOU TOLD ME TO SHUT UP,

21:57.547 --> 22:00.550
SO I'M JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND READ THE CEREAL BOX

22:00.550 --> 22:03.423
AND PRACTICE
KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.094
(crunching)

22:05.094 --> 22:09.459
I DIDN'T CHANGE ANY DATA
OR FALSIFY ANY RESULTS.

22:09.459 --> 22:12.462
OR SWITCH A SYRINGE
SO SOME SWEET, SAD OLD LADY

22:12.462 --> 22:15.405
WOULD GET THE DRUG
AND NOT THE PLACEBO?

22:15.405 --> 22:17.066
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

22:17.066 --> 22:19.569
(crunching)

22:19.569 --> 22:22.872
NOTHING I DID
WILL CHANGE ANY RESULTS.

22:22.872 --> 22:25.745
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE POTENTIAL
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.077
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
EXCEPT THE LIFE OF THE GUY

22:28.077 --> 22:30.480
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO GET
THE DRUG AND NOW WON'T.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.453
LOOK, THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT,
WHEN THE F.D.A. INVESTIGATES,

22:33.453 --> 22:35.755
THEY'LL INVALIDATE SEATTLE GRACE
AS A RESEARCH INSTITUTION.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.487
THAT BLACKLISTS YOU, DEREK,

22:37.487 --> 22:40.430
EVERY FRICKING DOCTOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

22:40.430 --> 22:41.961
THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOU.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.963
IT MESSES WITH ME.
IT MESSES WITH EVERYONE.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.566
I MEAN, I'M A LOT OF THINGS,
BUT I'M NOT A LIAR.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.638
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WERE EITHER.

22:48.638 --> 22:51.471
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
YOU'RE GONNA TELL?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.102
(sighs) MORNING.

22:57.006 --> 23:00.079
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

23:02.812 --> 23:04.914
(whispering) OKAY.

23:04.914 --> 23:07.517
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

23:07.517 --> 23:08.918
(Sofia cooing)

23:08.918 --> 23:11.390
(normal voice) OH.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.663
OH, GOOD.
CAN I BORROW SOMETHING?

23:13.663 --> 23:17.927
IT CAN BE ANYTHING, REALLY--
A HANDKERCHIEF, TISSUE, CASH.

23:17.927 --> 23:20.870
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
OLD, NEW, BLUE.

23:20.870 --> 23:23.873
I JUST NEED
SOMETHING BORROWED.
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM FATHER BROOKS.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.936
MM-HMM.
HIS WIFE
GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT.

23:26.936 --> 23:30.009
OH.
SHE'S OKAY, BUT, UH,
THEY'RE IN THE E.R. NOW.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.582
HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE WEDDING.

23:32.582 --> 23:34.944
(siren wailing)
YOU'RE KIDDING.

23:34.944 --> 23:36.946
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE KIDDING.

23:36.946 --> 23:39.719
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS

23:39.719 --> 23:42.722
TO FIND A MINISTER
WILLING TO MARRY US?

23:42.722 --> 23:45.895
WELL, HE LEFT ME SOME NUMBERS.
WE CAN CALL FOR A REPLACEMENT--

23:45.895 --> 23:48.898
(scoffs) NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW
WHAT? DON'T MAKE ANY CALLS.

23:48.898 --> 23:51.761
DON'T GET ANYONE. JUST...
(sighs) FORGET IT.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.106
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

24:00.009 --> 24:01.911
(whispers) LET'S GO.

24:09.719 --> 24:12.922
MOUSE J. HERE TOOK A TURN
FOR THE WORSE LAST NIGHT.

24:12.922 --> 24:14.884
I DID AN X-RAY.

24:14.884 --> 24:17.226
IT DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING,

24:17.226 --> 24:20.960
SO I DID A C.T.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.963
YOU DID AN X-RAY AND A C.T.
ON A MOUSE?

24:23.963 --> 24:25.965
I MEAN, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THIS C.T.,

24:25.965 --> 24:27.767
I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT.

24:27.767 --> 24:31.070
I COULDN'T EITHER,
WHICH IS WHY I DID AN M.R.I.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.073
YOU DID A C.T.
AND AN M.R.I.?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.075
AVERY, YOU HAVE $8,000
WORTH OF SCANS RIGHT HERE

24:36.075 --> 24:38.678
FOR A RODENT.
YES, SIR, I UNDERSTAND THAT,

24:38.678 --> 24:41.781
BUT IF YOU JUST LOOK
AT THE M.R.I. JUST LOOK.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.653
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

24:43.653 --> 24:45.054
(mice squeaking)

24:45.054 --> 24:47.056
I SEE A-A LITTLE HERNIA.

24:47.056 --> 24:49.789
AND THE PORTAL VEIN'S
NOT DRAINING VERY WELL.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.491
WHICH MEANS THE PROBLEM ISN'T
THE WAY THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.194
IT'SWHERE
THE DEVICE FUNCTIONS.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.768
WE JUST NEED TO PUT IT
CLOSER TO THE SURFACE,

24:58.768 --> 25:01.771
JUST UNDERNEATH THE SKIN.
LET'S GET STARTED.

25:01.771 --> 25:03.803
(Derek) HEY.
HI. YOU PAGED?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.905
YEAH. ZOLA, THIS IS MEREDITH.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.638
MEREDITH, THIS IS ZOLA.
(babbling)

25:08.638 --> 25:11.510
HERE, CAN YOU HOLD HER
FOR A MINUTE?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.912
UH, SURE.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.784
COME HERE. THERE. OKAY.

25:14.784 --> 25:17.186
ZOLA, CAN YOU SMILE FOR ME?
(coos)

25:17.186 --> 25:19.148
YEAH. SEE? HER FACIAL MOVEMENTS
ARE INTACT.

25:19.148 --> 25:21.791
OKAY, LOOK. OVER HERE.
SEE THAT?

25:21.791 --> 25:23.923
WATCH HOW SHE'S TRACKING ME.
OVER HERE.

25:23.923 --> 25:27.627
NEURO EXAM IS GOOD,
EVEN AFTER THE SHUNT.
GREAT. DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
WHY DID YOU PAGE?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.929
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,
OKAY?
OKAY.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.702
CAN YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE?
YES, DOCTOR.

25:32.702 --> 25:35.965
I NEED YOU TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH ME. OKAY?
IF ALEX SAID SOMETHING
TO YOU--

25:35.965 --> 25:37.937
LET'S ADOPT THIS BABY.
(cooing)

25:37.937 --> 25:41.210
WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

25:41.210 --> 25:43.843
YEAH. (laughs)

25:43.843 --> 25:46.816
YOU KNOW,
I WAS HOLDING HER YESTERDAY,

25:46.816 --> 25:49.218
AND SHE WAS CRYING,
AND THEN SHE STOPPED.

25:49.218 --> 25:51.220
AND I'VE--I'VE HELD
A LOT OF BABIES.

25:51.220 --> 25:54.824
I'VE FIXED A LOT OF BABIES,
BUT I LOOKED DOWN AT ZOLA--

25:54.824 --> 25:56.826
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.
I JUST--

25:56.826 --> 25:58.958
I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE HER
BEING WITH ANY OTHER PARENT

25:58.958 --> 26:00.960
OR ANY OTHER FAMILY.
(babbling)

26:00.960 --> 26:03.332
WE'VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD
TO START A FAMILY,

26:03.332 --> 26:05.935
AND--AND SHE NEEDS ONE.

26:05.935 --> 26:09.198
LET'S ADOPT HER.
I'M SERIOUS.

26:09.198 --> 26:12.171
LET'S ADOPT HER.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.873
(coos)

26:21.180 --> 26:22.782
(knock on door)

26:22.782 --> 26:23.913
(clicks)

26:25.584 --> 26:29.659
YOU REALIZE
YOUR DOOR IS UNLOCKED?

26:29.659 --> 26:32.261
I COULD BE ANYONE.

26:32.261 --> 26:36.125
I COULD BE... A BURGLAR
COMING TO BURGLE YOU.

26:36.125 --> 26:38.968
(sighs)

26:38.968 --> 26:41.931
WHERE IS THE BABY?

26:41.931 --> 26:43.102
OH.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.836
I COULD BE A BABY-NAPPER
TRYING TO BABY-NAP YOU.

26:48.337 --> 26:50.339
(sighs)
I KNOW WHY THEY SENT YOU.

26:50.339 --> 26:53.683
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU
SAY. THE WEDDING'S STILL OFF.

26:53.683 --> 26:56.285
MM.
MY MOM'S RIGHT.
IT'S A JOKE.

26:56.285 --> 26:59.348
IT'S NOT A WEDDING
AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

26:59.348 --> 27:00.950
OH, CALLIE.

27:00.950 --> 27:02.852
I CAN'T HAVE A PRIEST.

27:02.852 --> 27:05.695
I NO LONGER HAVE A MINISTER.

27:05.695 --> 27:09.759
(sobs) I'M NOT BEING GIVEN AWAY
BY MY DAD.

27:09.759 --> 27:11.961
THE WEDDING ISN'T LEGAL.
WHAT'S THE POINT?

27:11.961 --> 27:14.964
(crying) THIS ISN'T A WEDDING.
IT'S NOT EVEN IN A CHURCH.

27:14.964 --> 27:17.967
IT'S NOTHING. IT'S A COUPLE
OF GIRLS PLAYING DRESS UP.

27:17.967 --> 27:19.969
(chuckles, normal voice)
IT'S NOT REAL.

27:19.969 --> 27:21.771
IT'S NOT REAL.

27:21.771 --> 27:23.172
J--OKAY.

27:23.172 --> 27:26.175
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DO NOT NEED THE LAW

27:26.175 --> 27:29.178
OR A PRIEST OR YOUR MOTHER
TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING REAL.

27:29.178 --> 27:30.920
AND--AND THE CHURCH IS...

27:30.920 --> 27:34.023
THE CHURCH CAN BE ANYWHERE
YOU WANT IT TO BE--

27:34.023 --> 27:36.425
I-IN A FIELD...
(chuckling) ON A MOUNTAIN,

27:36.425 --> 27:39.158
RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM,

27:39.158 --> 27:43.793
ANYWHERE--BECAUSE WHERE
DO YOU THINK GOD IS?

27:43.793 --> 27:46.065
MNH-MNH-MNH.

27:46.065 --> 27:49.068
(laughs) COME ON.
HE'S IN YOU.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.800
HE'S IN ME.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.003
JUST RIGHT HERE,
IN THE MIDDLE OF US.

27:54.003 --> 27:57.046
NOW YOUR--YOUR CHURCH JUST
HASN'T CAUGHT UP TO GOD YET.

27:57.046 --> 27:58.878
YOUR MOTHER... (sighs)

27:58.878 --> 28:02.782
SHE HASN'T CAUGHT UP
TO GOD YET.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.814
AND BY THE WAY...

28:04.814 --> 28:07.817
(crying)
SHE MAY NOT EVER CATCH UP,
BUT IT'S OKAY.

28:07.817 --> 28:09.889
MM.
IT'S OKAY.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.162
IF YOU ARE WILLING
TO STAND UP

28:13.162 --> 28:17.827
IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS
AND FAMILY AND GOD

28:17.827 --> 28:20.930
AND COMMIT YOURSELF...

28:20.930 --> 28:22.872
TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING,

28:22.872 --> 28:28.037
TO--TO GIVE OF YOURSELF
IN THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP,

28:28.037 --> 28:31.981
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
IN SICKNESS AND HEALTH,

28:31.981 --> 28:34.383
HONEY, THAT IS A MARRIAGE.

28:34.383 --> 28:37.216
THAT IS REAL.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.318
AND THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.021
BESIDES...

28:42.021 --> 28:45.494
GIRL, I GOT LEGALLY MARRIED
TO A MAN IN A CHURCH.

28:45.494 --> 28:48.798
LOOK HOW WELL THAT TURNED OUT.

28:48.798 --> 28:51.200
(laughs)
(sighs)

28:51.200 --> 28:54.203
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S A SMALL DEFECT

29:13.452 --> 29:15.885
AT THE NECK

29:15.885 --> 29:18.357
GREY, PULL UP ON YOUR PICKUPS
SO I CAN GET IN THERE.

29:18.357 --> 29:22.161

ARE YOU GONNA USE AN 11-BLADE

29:51.921 --> 29:54.894

WITHOUT SACRIFICING MUCH OF
THE INTESTINES AT ALL.

29:57.897 --> 30:01.430
HELL OF A SAVE.
SO, DR. HUNT, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'VE BEEN PUT IN CHARGE

30:01.430 --> 30:03.402
OF DETERMINING
THE NEXT CHIEF RESIDENT.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.005
WITH INPUT FROM ALL OF
THE ATTENDINGS OBVIOUSLY.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.007
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

30:08.007 --> 30:10.039
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT APRIL KEPNER.

30:10.039 --> 30:13.042
I THINK IF YOU CHECK MY FILE,
YOU'LL SEE THAT I RARELY GIVE

30:13.042 --> 30:15.414
FORMAL FEEDBACK
ABOUT MY RESIDENTS.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.517
WHEN I DO, IT IS
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY NEGATIVE.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.250
THAT SAID,

30:21.250 --> 30:23.953
I'D VERY MUCH LIKE
TO RECOMMEND APRIL KEPNER

30:23.953 --> 30:25.955
FOR THE CHIEF RESIDENT
POSITION.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.997
SHE GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND
FOR HER PATIENTS

30:27.997 --> 30:29.999
EVEN WHEN SHE ISN'T ASKED.

30:29.999 --> 30:32.301
WELL, ESPECIALLY
WHEN SHE ISN'T ASKED.

30:32.301 --> 30:34.433
SHE SEES THE PATIENT
AS A WHOLE,

30:34.433 --> 30:36.435
NOT JUST AS A SET OF SYMPTOMS.

30:36.435 --> 30:40.239
I'LL TELL YOU, THAT KIND OF
CARING, THAT CAN'T BE TAUGHT.

30:40.239 --> 30:43.242

WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE HER

30:43.242 --> 30:44.843

30:44.843 --> 30:47.246
