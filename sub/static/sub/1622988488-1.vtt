Can you keep 'em until 7:00?

05:20.291 --> 05:21.916
Maybe they could stay the night?

05:22.375 --> 05:24.000
Just have them back by 7:00.

Fine.

What are you looking for?

05:56.958 --> 05:58.166
[sighing] Nothing.

05:59.208 --> 06:02.291
-Why are we even doing this?

I just worked the night shift,

08:08.166 --> 08:10.500
I don't think we're gonna get
an ambulance here,

08:10.583 --> 08:13.583
but the VA Hospital's just
four blocks away, and...

08:13.666 --> 08:15.208
you're gonna need stitches.

08:15.291 --> 08:17.041
-What?
-[sheriff] Stitches.

08:24.916 --> 08:27.375
Hey, excuse me. Um, I need a doctor.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.000
Um, uh, we just got into a car accident

08:29.083 --> 08:31.083
and my daughter was, uh,
spitting up water.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.000
You okay?

08:33.125 --> 08:34.166

08:37.708 --> 08:38.583
[woman 1 sighing]

08:38.666 --> 08:40.416
It's a terrorist attack, for sure.

08:41.791 --> 08:42.625
What?

08:43.125 --> 08:45.750
Terrorists?
Able to shut off all the power...

08:46.333 --> 08:48.250
-to cars?
-Maybe it was the Chinese, right?

08:48.333 --> 08:51.166
They built all this shit
so maybe they just turned it all off.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.666
[man 2] And maybe we're at war.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.500
Maybe they blew up New York and LA,
and we're next.

08:57.541 --> 08:58.750
[inhales sharply]

09:01.458 --> 09:03.208

[woman 3 speaking Greek]

09:06.458 --> 09:08.000

Please, someone!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.750
[Doris] The phones aren't working,
the power's out--

09:43.125 --> 09:44.291
What happened?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.541
The car's in the lake.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.500
Always clear out the air.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.458
-Always.
-Good girl.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.833
-Hey, Doris, you good on meds?
-[Doris] I got plenty.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.000
The store's not taking credit cards.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.791
Do you have cash for food?

10:10.833 --> 10:13.625
The cash was in the car. In the lake.

10:14.208 --> 10:17.333
I-- I can see if I can pick something
up on the way home from the university.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.708
I'm in at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I just need to get a little sleep.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.916
You're still going to work?

10:24.166 --> 10:27.166
Yeah. They don't have power.
They're gonna need security.

10:27.791 --> 10:30.125
You know, there's no point
in you walking home.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.000
Why don't you spend the night?

10:33.916 --> 10:34.791
Thanks, Doris.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.958
[Doris] I don't know
how you sleep like that.

11:56.791 --> 11:58.791
I'm not sleeping. Meditating.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.083
[inhaling sharply]

12:00.166 --> 12:01.083
Does it help?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.625
Hmm. Think so.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.541
You know when you wake up in the morning,
everything is good for a minute

12:11.625 --> 12:13.208
before the shittiness hits you?

12:13.291 --> 12:14.750
[inhaling]

12:14.833 --> 12:16.541
I get that minute when I meditate.

12:17.583 --> 12:21.125
I tried yoga when my hip started hurting,
but...

12:21.208 --> 12:22.583
it didn't work for me.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.708
Do you, uh...

12:29.833 --> 12:32.416
You have a little something
to help me sleep?

12:33.750 --> 12:34.958
I don't do that anymore.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.708
You know the judge said
that I wasn't allowed.

12:39.291 --> 12:43.083
Well, I guess you really aren't using
if you're awake too.

12:45.291 --> 12:46.458
I'm gonna head to work.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.541
I'll stop at the pharmacy
and get you something.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.916
[floorboards creaking]

13:10.458 --> 13:12.416
[woman 1] Why don't you get some sleep?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.208
[Noah] I'm not tired.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.125
Look at all the shooting stars.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.708
Those are satellites, Noah.

-Hey, hey, hey, I need more stuff.
-Relax, okay?

14:06.083 --> 14:10.666
Downers, benzos, phennies, tooies,
red jackets, people are crazy right now,

14:10.750 --> 14:13.833
amped up. That shit'll be, like, gold.
I'll double the price.

14:13.916 --> 14:15.500
No, fuck, I didn't say that.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.416
Yeah. Yeah, you did say that.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.708
All right. I'll do it. Fucking Gregg's
a man of his word, all right?

14:20.791 --> 14:22.791
Cash in, cash out. Cycle of life.

14:22.875 --> 14:25.833
I'll double the price
on all types of zombie pills. Come on.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.375
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.041
Angel?

14:41.083 --> 14:42.458
Where the fuck is everyone?

15:18.875 --> 15:20.708
[woman 4] How'd you get
your cars to run, huh?

15:20.791 --> 15:23.416
How come our cars aren't working?
What the fuck is going on?

15:29.500 --> 15:30.375
[banging on door]

15:30.458 --> 15:32.291
-Hey!
-Easy.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.416
Easy. I'm 68 Whiskey. Corporal Adams.
Out of Fort Huachuca.

15:35.916 --> 15:37.291
What are you doing up here?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.791
Not active anymore. I mean, I might be.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.458
I don't know. They call in reserves yet?
I just don't know.

15:42.541 --> 15:43.458
She's fine.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.333
That's a lot of pills, Jill.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.500
I can explain.
It's not what it looks like, I promise.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.041
-[woman 5] Pack those up for me, please.
-[Jill] Yes, ma'am.

15:56.291 --> 16:00.041
I know you stuck your neck out for me
to get this job, and I am so appreciative,

16:00.125 --> 16:02.250
-and-- and I know I screwed up--
-I don't care.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.000
Was that an EMP yesterday? Are we at war?

16:07.083 --> 16:10.375
People are saying it's been happening
all over. Who would we even attack?

16:12.375 --> 16:13.291
[Jill] Major Murphy?

16:13.375 --> 16:16.500
Hard drives are useless.
Anything with a microchip is fried.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.500
Here's everything I have on hard copy.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.250
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:20.666 --> 16:22.250
[soldier] Any additional personnel?

16:23.458 --> 16:24.541
I'm starting a hub.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.041
We could use you.

16:26.125 --> 16:27.333
What's going on, Murphy?

16:27.916 --> 16:31.583
We were the "get answers" people
over there. They need those people again.

16:31.666 --> 16:32.583
[soldier] Major...

16:33.375 --> 16:34.458
we need to go now.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.208
I can't do that anymore.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.375
This is the location of the hub.

16:44.458 --> 16:46.750
I'd like you to get Lori and my children,
and...

16:46.833 --> 16:48.750
get down there as soon as you can,
all right?

16:48.833 --> 16:50.125
Absolutely. No problem.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.000
[man 3]
You don't understand how serious this is.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.291
You should have gone with her.

16:58.375 --> 17:01.041
How is Murphy gonna bring the power back?
She's a psychiatrist.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.500
[man 3] It's not about the power.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.916
There are contingencies for that.
Replace enough wires and fuses...

17:07.000 --> 17:08.250
It's about the people.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.666
Nobody can sleep.

17:10.750 --> 17:14.166
[exhaling] After 48 hours of no sleep,
there's a loss of critical thinking.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.875
Ninety-six hours,
hallucinations, motor failure.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.500
But what about after that?
Organs will fail but then what?

17:20.958 --> 17:23.708
Days of lying in paralysis
until the heart shuts off?

17:24.333 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, yeah, I know what happens.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.041
Of course, you do.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.000
But this is different.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.916
Everything is accelerated.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.791
Symptoms are appearing
two to three times quicker.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.208
It's gonna be total chaos.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.291
We're not all going to die.

17:43.541 --> 17:46.916
-Well, this is not happening to everyone.
-Yes, it is.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.958
Well, there is this one woman
who can sleep.

17:51.416 --> 17:52.708
They're bringing her to this hub.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.166
Matilda was sleeping too.
My daughter was sleeping.

17:57.958 --> 17:58.875
Are you sure?

18:00.416 --> 18:03.750
Jill, they're setting up a whole station
based on this one sleeper.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.791
That's how big of a deal she is.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.416
Are you sure your daughter was sleeping?

18:11.458 --> 18:13.708
Oh, I-I... I got into a car accident,

18:14.166 --> 18:16.333
-but I'm fine.
-Was your daughter also hurt?

18:16.750 --> 18:17.833
What are you saying?

18:18.583 --> 18:20.958
I'm just saying,
odds are she wasn't sleeping.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.750
What, do you think she's unconscious?

18:25.125 --> 18:27.791
There are no such thing
as unconscious people anymore.

18:28.416 --> 18:29.291
They're either...

18:30.041 --> 18:31.333
on, or they're...

18:32.875 --> 18:33.875
off.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.083
[footsteps hurriedly departing]

18:42.166 --> 18:43.000
[door closing]

18:43.625 --> 18:45.208
[dogs barking]

18:59.416 --> 19:00.333
Matilda?

19:00.791 --> 19:01.625
Matilda!

19:03.041 --> 19:03.875
Matilda!

19:03.958 --> 19:05.500
[panting]

19:07.750 --> 19:10.083
Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?

19:10.166 --> 19:11.833
Where is your sister?
Where is your sister?

19:11.916 --> 19:12.833
You're hurting me!

19:12.916 --> 19:14.416
-[shaky breathing]
-Psycho.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.666
I'm sorry, I know.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.416
Where-- Where is Matilda? Is she okay?

19:18.333 --> 19:19.625
Yeah, she's fine.

19:19.708 --> 19:21.875
Where is she? Please, Noah.

19:22.416 --> 19:24.541
Church. Grandma took her to church.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.833
Maybe we are meant to be awake.

19:31.333 --> 19:34.208
'Cause you need to be woke
to see how the world really is.

19:35.666 --> 19:38.708
And the Lord says,
"Come to me, all who labor

19:39.416 --> 19:41.833
and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest."

19:41.916 --> 19:43.458
She's not sleeping.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.375
[knocking on door]

19:48.458 --> 19:49.583
[door opening]

19:50.083 --> 19:52.000
[footsteps approaching]

19:53.291 --> 19:54.333
[door closing]

19:55.083 --> 19:56.291
Not sleeping, Birdie?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.708
Only my dad called me that.

20:00.791 --> 20:04.166
I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm just... tired.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.458
[pastor sighing]

20:14.416 --> 20:15.375
Not everyone...

20:16.541 --> 20:18.416
asked to be called to God, you know.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.541
Some people just are.

20:24.416 --> 20:27.958
I know that more than most
because before I was a pastor...

20:30.333 --> 20:31.458
I was a drug addict.

20:34.041 --> 20:34.916
[chuckling]

20:37.416 --> 20:39.458
Covered up the evidence with a tattoo.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.666
I overdosed.

20:45.666 --> 20:48.250
I mean, I should've died within hours,
but I didn't.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.625
I had built up such an immunity
to narcotics over the years, I just...

20:55.041 --> 20:57.625
laid there for three days in rest...

20:58.916 --> 21:00.541
'til eventually I passed.

21:02.708 --> 21:06.541
But I was only gone for a minute
when they found me.

21:08.708 --> 21:11.500
So, like Jesus, I...
returned from the dead.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.416
[chuckling]

21:14.583 --> 21:17.291
Now, I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.
I just...

21:17.375 --> 21:18.416
[inhales deeply]

21:19.333 --> 21:20.291
I'm saying that...

21:20.875 --> 21:24.291
since that day,
I dedicated my life to serving him.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.041
And to me...

21:28.958 --> 21:31.375
it was a miracle that I survived,
you know?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.541
And I think people really need
a miracle right now.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.458
I'm not sure what...

21:41.958 --> 21:42.916
I mean...

21:46.708 --> 21:48.000
You think I need to die?

21:49.083 --> 21:49.916
No.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.875
No, of course not.

21:53.541 --> 21:55.750
No, I'm sorry. No.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.041
I, um...

21:59.583 --> 22:02.625
[inhaling deeply]

22:03.041 --> 22:04.208
[pastor exhaling]

22:05.333 --> 22:09.833
It's just everyone is tired
and... desperate, you know?

22:12.125 --> 22:14.250
People just want to know if you can sleep.

22:16.583 --> 22:17.750
I can sleep.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.875
It's just hard when I'm not tired.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.000
Would it be okay if I prayed with you?

22:28.500 --> 22:32.250
A lot of children say my prayers
are so boring, they nod right off.

22:33.166 --> 22:34.166
[chuckling]

22:40.041 --> 22:43.041
Lord, we thank you for this day
and we thank you for Matilda.

22:46.166 --> 22:47.000
What the...

22:47.708 --> 22:48.916
[panting]

22:49.875 --> 22:51.291
Oh, okay.

22:51.708 --> 22:55.375
717-127-0414.

22:55.958 --> 22:56.833
[grunting]

22:57.625 --> 22:59.750
[mumbling numbers softly]

23:02.333 --> 23:03.416
[Noah] Pizza, really?

23:03.500 --> 23:06.750
Uh, no, it's a test
for mental sharpness.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.000
-[Noah] How'd you do?
-I-I got two wrong. It's fine.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.625
Uh, we need to go and find a car,
and get your sister somewhere safe, okay?

23:12.708 --> 23:14.208
Everything with a circuit's fried.

23:14.291 --> 23:16.916
-Cars don't work, Jill.
-[sighing] Some do, Noah. Okay?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.916
So, can you just help me out, please?

23:19.208 --> 23:20.541
Grab your bag. Let's go.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.416
We need to be careful.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.916
Oh, shit!

23:25.000 --> 23:27.208
-Your daughter, can she sleep?
-[Jill] What?

23:27.291 --> 23:29.583
-Is this your boyfriend?
-No. No!

23:29.666 --> 23:30.625
[Jill panting]

23:30.708 --> 23:32.500
She can't sleep? Is she okay?

23:32.583 --> 23:35.791
No, she's fine, she's fine. I was wrong.
She was just pretending.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.000
Matilda was totally sleeping.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.083
I woke her up.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.000
[Jill sighing]

23:41.083 --> 23:42.583
What? She was sleeping.

23:43.666 --> 23:46.750
Jesus, Jill, we need to get your daughter
to Murphy.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.833
-Look, she could be key.
-Noah, we gotta go.

23:48.916 --> 23:49.958
I know where the hub is.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.875
They're setting up a station
to help solve this.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.375
Look, they already have this one sleeper.

23:54.791 --> 23:57.458
Brian, we're not going there.
Come on. Noah, let's go.

23:59.291 --> 24:01.375
[Jill yelling] Hey! Yo, that's my bike!

24:01.791 --> 24:02.625
Hey!

24:03.750 --> 24:06.541
[pastor] In our basement,
like an angel of peace,

24:06.625 --> 24:08.000
a young girl sleeps.

24:08.833 --> 24:09.958
So if she can sleep,

24:10.041 --> 24:12.125
-that means we can too.
-[people murmuring]

24:12.208 --> 24:14.250
So, as all mankind lays awake,

24:14.333 --> 24:15.583
we pray for answers.

24:16.125 --> 24:18.000
-[man 4] Pastor...
-Yeah.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.500
So what if she can sleep?

24:20.916 --> 24:22.833
Miracles spread, Jim.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.458
Just like good grows,
if you believe in it,

24:25.541 --> 24:26.875
if you give it a fighting chance.

24:26.958 --> 24:29.375
[man 5] There is no over-the-counter
sleeping pills left.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.166
[man 6] Give us the stuff
behind the counter!

24:31.250 --> 24:33.500
[man 5] You'll have to talk
to your doctors. Get the notes.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.041
[man 6] You know no doctor's answering
his phone.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.416
Please, I can't help you!

24:36.875 --> 24:38.375
[indistinct screaming]

24:40.208 --> 24:41.041
Come on.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.666
Come on, Noah. Keep up.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.416
[indistinct screaming continues]

24:51.791 --> 24:52.625
Come on.

24:54.541 --> 24:55.375
Whoa.

24:57.416 --> 24:58.291
[Jill] Wait here.

25:16.708 --> 25:17.833
[Noah] Oh, God.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.166
It's only going to get worse.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.458
What's happening to everyone?

25:25.541 --> 25:26.458
[indistinct screaming]

25:26.541 --> 25:27.791
[dog barking]

25:28.250 --> 25:29.333
If we don't sleep...

25:30.583 --> 25:32.791
Your mind will bend and bend
until it breaks.

25:33.458 --> 25:34.500
-[Noah sighing]
-You snap.

25:34.583 --> 25:36.541
Life changes like that.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.416
But it's adversity
that prompts us to change

25:40.500 --> 25:42.125
-when we otherwise wouldn't.
-[all] Amen.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.583
So then we embrace it.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.000
[Jim] Pastor...

25:47.000 --> 25:47.875
She's awake.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.583
[people murmuring]

25:51.250 --> 25:53.833
-Matilda...
-When are you gonna make us sleep?

25:53.916 --> 25:56.583
-Patience, please.
-[man 7] I don't have patience right now.

25:56.666 --> 25:59.666
Raymond isn't responding.
He's eating but not talking.

25:59.750 --> 26:02.583
-He's tired, just like the rest of us.
-He's beyond tired.

26:02.666 --> 26:05.250
-He'll be fine.
-[woman 6] We should sacrifice her.

26:05.333 --> 26:06.375
[pastor] No.

26:06.458 --> 26:09.791
God sacrificed Jesus,
his own son, to save us.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.000
God willingly sacrificed himself
for our sins.

26:12.083 --> 26:15.958
There is no sacrifice needed.
We... We only need prayer.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.541
God help me,
I'm willing to be Pontius Pilate

26:18.625 --> 26:20.500
-and condemn the girl.
-Robert, sit down.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.416
[yelling] Sit down!

26:21.500 --> 26:23.250
-[pastor] That's enough.
-[man 7] What good is prayer?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.416
We need sleep.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.833
Oh. Matilda.

26:25.916 --> 26:27.625
-[Matilda] Mommy!
-Hey, hold on.

26:28.583 --> 26:31.166
Please, sit-- Sit down everyone.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.291
Jill, we just wanted to pray with Matilda,
that's it.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.958
She can sleep. Maybe she can help.
Lord knows we all need help right now.

26:38.666 --> 26:42.083
Come on. Matilda is my daughter,
and she's coming with me.

26:42.166 --> 26:44.541
-[woman 7] Not legally, she ain't.
-Please, sit-- sit down.

26:44.625 --> 26:47.750
Doris... Doris takes care
of those kids by law.

26:49.916 --> 26:50.791
You're right.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.875
But right now, with what's happening,

26:55.666 --> 26:57.500
I can help, and you know I can help.

26:58.083 --> 27:01.041
-[Jill] Okay, come on, Matilda. Let's go.
-[Jim] She has to stay here.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.041
[pastor] Hey, Jim.

27:02.125 --> 27:03.125
She's special.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.208
-[woman 8] She is.
-Okay.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.875
-Just calm down, everyone.
-[Matilda] Mom?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.750
-[man] Pastor, you promised.
-Sit down, please.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.666
[Brian] We're on the same team here.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.833
You're all absolutely right.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.458
-She is special.
-[woman 9] That's right.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.000
[Brian] But she can't help anyone here.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.583
Now, we're all gonna die

27:23.083 --> 27:24.458
if we don't solve this.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.750
Right now, your brains
are slowly swelling.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.875
Our cranial walls are impressing
on the brain,

27:31.958 --> 27:33.833
and it's affecting critical thinking.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.250
It's what happens when we don't sleep.

27:37.541 --> 27:40.291
Now, the more excited we get,

27:40.375 --> 27:42.958
the more blood flows to the brain,
the worse we are.

27:44.125 --> 27:46.208
So, the best thing we can do right now...

27:46.291 --> 27:47.416
[inhaling deeply]

27:47.500 --> 27:48.750
is take a deep breath...

27:48.833 --> 27:49.708
[exhaling]

27:50.458 --> 27:51.458
and calm down.

27:55.750 --> 27:59.250
Now, we're gathering scientists
and doctors to help solve this.

28:00.125 --> 28:01.083
And they can.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.208
And all they need is the girl.

28:07.791 --> 28:08.666
Mom?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.583
[breathing heavily]

28:10.666 --> 28:12.791
No one dismisses the value of science,

28:12.875 --> 28:16.875
but neither is she a test subject
to run experiments on...

28:16.958 --> 28:19.125
-You're not taking her anywhere.
-[pastor] Jim, please.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.791
-[woman 10] That's right.
-Prayers are not gonna save--

28:21.875 --> 28:23.375
Fucking people,

28:23.458 --> 28:25.833
if you don't hand her over,
I'll be back with the Army,

28:25.916 --> 28:27.250
and they're not gonna ask nicely.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.125
-You calm down!
-[Brian] Is that what you want?

28:29.208 --> 28:32.916
Because unless you people wake up,
that is exactly what is gonna happen.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.375
And book throwing, that's gonna--

28:34.458 --> 28:35.291
[gunshot]

28:35.375 --> 28:36.291
[people screaming]

28:38.791 --> 28:40.541
[pastor] Jim, what have you done?

28:40.625 --> 28:42.583
[woman 7] Doris took her down the back.

28:43.541 --> 28:45.708
Noah, Noah, look at me.
You're gonna be okay. All right?

28:45.791 --> 28:48.541
I need you to meet me in the forest
out back. I'm gonna get your sister.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.500
[people screaming indistinctly]]

29:03.208 --> 29:04.666
-[woman 11] She in there?
-[man 9] Hey!

29:04.750 --> 29:06.500
-[man 9] Bring her out!
-[man 10] Get her out here!

29:06.583 --> 29:09.333
[man 9] She's not in there.
Get the guys. Let's look out back.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.916
[crowd murmuring indistinctly]

29:12.166 --> 29:13.541
[crowd gasping]

29:13.625 --> 29:15.458
-[Doris gasping]
-Where is she?

29:15.875 --> 29:17.958
[Doris] She's not in there? She was.

29:18.416 --> 29:19.625
It's a miracle.

29:20.500 --> 29:24.000
This isn't Jesus
rising from the tomb, Doris.

29:26.541 --> 29:28.166
This is not who we are.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.041
[pastor] Jim?

29:34.125 --> 29:34.958
Jim!

29:38.166 --> 29:39.541
[soft crying]

29:41.666 --> 29:42.500
Matilda.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.666
Oh, my God, my baby.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.833
-Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
-[Matilda whimpering]

29:49.416 --> 29:52.291
-Grandma told me to run, but I couldn't.
-Oh, that's okay.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.208
-Are you okay?
-Oh. No, I'm fine, baby. I'm fine.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.500
-Please.
-[Jim] God spoke to me, Pastor.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.458
-Put it down.
-[Jim] We can't let her leave.

30:02.375 --> 30:05.291
Jim, put it-- put it down, please.
You're scaring everyone.

30:05.375 --> 30:06.916
[pastor breathing heavily]

30:07.625 --> 30:09.750
[panting]

30:19.666 --> 30:20.541
[pastor] Jim!

30:22.208 --> 30:24.291
Please put down the gun.

30:36.583 --> 30:37.458
[gunshots]

30:37.541 --> 30:39.333
-[people screaming]
-[Noah breathing shakily]

30:39.416 --> 30:40.458
[panting]

30:42.291 --> 30:43.833
[Jill] Come on, stay close.

30:44.250 --> 30:46.291
-Come on.
-[Matilda] Mom, stop, please!

30:46.375 --> 30:47.375
What about Grandma!

30:48.583 --> 30:49.916
[panting]

30:50.666 --> 30:51.541
[Jill] Baby...

30:53.291 --> 30:56.083
Your grandmother can't run, okay?
She has a condition.

30:56.208 --> 30:57.666
-All right?
-But Mom, please--

30:57.750 --> 30:59.583
No, no, no, no. She's gonna be fine.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.458
-I need you to keep up with me, okay?
-Okay.

31:02.541 --> 31:03.625
How are you feeling?

31:03.708 --> 31:04.666
No more running.

31:05.458 --> 31:07.625
-All right, piggy-back time. Come on.
-Okay.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.583
Let's go, Noah.

31:09.666 --> 31:11.375
[Jill panting]

31:11.458 --> 31:12.416
This way.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.333
Come on.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.916
We're here.

31:19.166 --> 31:20.291
[Matilda panting]

31:20.375 --> 31:21.250
[Jill] Come here.

31:21.333 --> 31:22.750
[Jill panting]

31:28.416 --> 31:30.666
[Jill] We're gonna need a car.
You stay here.

31:30.958 --> 31:32.041
I'm gonna go get one.

31:32.125 --> 31:34.041
Where are we going? [panting]

31:34.833 --> 31:35.916
They call it the hub.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.791
We can't go there.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.583
-You don't know what they're capable of.
-But we need to find a cure.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.791
Noah, it's not that simple.

31:43.875 --> 31:46.375
It-- It's right here,
wherever this-- this is.

31:46.958 --> 31:49.125
I touched a dead body to get this.
A dead body!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.125
It's not safe there.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.625
What's your plan here, Jill?

31:53.375 --> 31:55.041
We bring Matilda somewhere safe,

31:55.583 --> 31:57.875
we both die, and she lives alone?

31:58.333 --> 32:00.458
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

32:03.875 --> 32:04.708
Here.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.541
Light this. Light it.

32:07.625 --> 32:11.083
-Burn it. Burn this, and we can't go.
-Noah, stop that.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.291
It doesn't work.

32:13.416 --> 32:15.125
[breathing heavily]

32:18.875 --> 32:19.833
Wake up, Mom.

32:20.708 --> 32:22.333
[Noah] This is our only chance.

32:23.041 --> 32:26.041
If we're all gone,
she'll be dead within days.

32:27.041 --> 32:30.708
There's another woman there already.
They're gonna find a cure. They will.

32:37.625 --> 32:38.500
[Noah] Please.

32:43.916 --> 32:44.750
Okay.

32:45.666 --> 32:47.000
[birds chirping]

33:08.291 --> 33:09.208
[rock clattering]

33:10.666 --> 33:11.500
Hello?

33:16.291 --> 33:17.125
Hello?

33:18.375 --> 33:19.250
Gregg?

33:19.958 --> 33:22.250
215-124-0519.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.416
[mumbling softly]

33:32.333 --> 33:33.416
Not even close.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.166
Hello?

33:42.708 --> 33:43.541
Gregg?

33:48.625 --> 33:51.291
[man 11] We got the pick of the litter.
How about the Beemer instead?

33:51.375 --> 33:54.916
-[man 12] Idiot! It's gotta be an old car.
-[soft thud]

33:56.041 --> 33:56.875
What was that?

33:59.208 --> 34:00.166
[whispering] Gregg.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.500
[Gregg breathing heavily]

34:03.291 --> 34:04.125
[gun cocking]

34:07.666 --> 34:09.833
[Gregg breathing heavily]

34:13.875 --> 34:15.458
It's just Gregg.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.916
He's, like, still awake.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.458
He can't even sleep now?

34:21.041 --> 34:21.958
Shit.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.875
Sleep.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.833
-Sleep.
-[Gregg whimpering]

34:28.916 --> 34:31.833
Sleep, baby, sleep.

34:33.666 --> 34:37.000
[stomping]

34:37.083 --> 34:37.958
Okay.

34:38.666 --> 34:41.208
Okay, can we focus?
Get that Camry started?

34:42.791 --> 34:43.750
Goddamn!

34:44.583 --> 34:47.416
World's in chaos
and you're wasting time stomping heads.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.458
Why can't we do the Beemer?

34:51.583 --> 34:53.500
[man 12] This is the last time I tell you.

34:53.583 --> 34:57.333
We need an old car. No electronics.

34:57.416 --> 35:01.875
It had no battery in it
when whatever the fuck was happening...

35:02.166 --> 35:03.541
[man 11] Now I'll start it.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.458
The Camaro or the Dodge should work
with one of the older batteries.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.958
[wrench cranking]

35:12.041 --> 35:13.541
Get in. Give it a shot.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.458
[man speaking indistinctly]

35:15.541 --> 35:16.458
[car door opening]

35:16.541 --> 35:17.458
[man 12] Ahh...

35:17.791 --> 35:18.708
[car door closing]

35:19.125 --> 35:21.583
[man 11] Transmission's in.
Fingers crossed.

35:21.666 --> 35:22.625
[man 12] It's fine.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.708
-[man 11] Tell me when you're ready.
-[man 12] Yeah.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.708
[attempting to start engine]

35:28.750 --> 35:29.916
-[engine revving]
-Whoo!

35:30.000 --> 35:32.416
[man 11] There it is.
Told you we could boost the battery.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.916
-[man 12] Sweet!
-[man 11] Go get the keys for the Dodge.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.250
And grab the battery we brought up
from the basement!

35:37.333 --> 35:38.875
-[engine revving]
-[man 11] Ha-ha!

35:38.958 --> 35:40.291
[man 12] But I get the Camaro.

35:40.375 --> 35:41.375
[man 11] What?

35:41.458 --> 35:43.708
[man 12] I get the Camaro.

35:44.875 --> 35:48.416
-I don't want a Polara. I want a Camaro.
-[man 11] Just grab the keys, pendejo.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.333
[man 12] All right!

35:52.250 --> 35:53.125
All right.

35:54.166 --> 35:55.208
[keys clattering]

35:57.708 --> 35:58.833
[man 11] You find it?

35:58.916 --> 36:01.125
[man 12] They're in here somewhere.
You find 'em.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.458
I want the Camaro.

36:02.541 --> 36:03.708
Is that right, sheriff?

36:05.875 --> 36:07.750
[man 12] I'm taking that fucking car.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.208
[man 11] You're not.

36:09.291 --> 36:12.000
-Yo, you hear that?
-[car accelerating in the distance]

36:12.666 --> 36:15.041
-[man 11] You heard that, right?
-[man 12] Yeah.

36:15.125 --> 36:16.958
Someone else got a car running, too.

36:17.041 --> 36:17.875
[man 11] Fuck.

36:21.375 --> 36:22.375
[groaning]

36:24.250 --> 36:26.875
Man, they were stocked up. Medical shit.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.541
Bet they could sleep with that.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.458
Let's go.

36:31.916 --> 36:34.708
[man 11] Grab all the keys.
We'll come back for the Dodge later.

36:34.791 --> 36:35.750
[car door opening]

36:36.375 --> 36:37.333
[car door closing]

36:37.416 --> 36:39.041
[engine starting]

36:39.125 --> 36:40.458
[tires squealing]

36:44.416 --> 36:45.541
[tires squealing]

36:48.333 --> 36:49.458
[exhaling]

36:49.541 --> 36:50.416
[sighing]

36:51.083 --> 36:53.083
[breathing heavily]

36:54.833 --> 36:56.000
[keys jangling]

36:58.708 --> 37:01.750
[keys rattling]

37:02.125 --> 37:03.583
[continues breathing heavily]

37:07.083 --> 37:09.083
Here. It's easy.

37:12.625 --> 37:13.708
Just one motion.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.166
Who's Emily?

37:18.083 --> 37:19.166
[Noah] My girlfriend.

37:20.333 --> 37:21.333
Ex-girlfriend.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.458
Did you guys ever...

37:25.708 --> 37:26.541
do it?

37:26.958 --> 37:27.791
What?

37:27.875 --> 37:29.125
[vehicle approaching]

37:32.333 --> 37:33.250
Shit.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.458
Mom?

37:39.375 --> 37:40.416
Everything okay?

37:41.208 --> 37:42.416
Noah's never had sex.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.541
I--

37:46.166 --> 37:47.125
I have.

37:48.958 --> 37:49.791
Hey, get in.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.208
Seat belt on.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.666
[car engine purring]

38:04.291 --> 38:06.166
So, what happened with this girlfriend?

38:06.250 --> 38:07.208
No.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.916
We're-- We're not going to talk about this
right now.

38:10.208 --> 38:14.416
Noah, come on. I basically--
I basically had you when I was your age.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.750
We do not need to have this conversation.

38:16.833 --> 38:17.791
Okay.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.875
-But you can talk to me if you--
-[Noah] Are we done?

38:24.750 --> 38:25.625
Yeah, we're done.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.416
[Noah sighing]

38:32.791 --> 38:33.708
[Noah] Why her?

38:34.625 --> 38:35.500
Why not us?

38:36.125 --> 38:37.125
[Jill] What's this?

38:41.250 --> 38:42.166
Stay in the car.

38:42.875 --> 38:43.875
[car door opening]

38:43.958 --> 38:45.083
[engine idling]

38:47.583 --> 38:48.500
[car door closing]

39:00.333 --> 39:01.500
[crickets chirping]

39:48.666 --> 39:50.666
[car engine purring]

39:59.500 --> 40:00.375
[zipper zipping]

40:18.041 --> 40:20.791
[Jill sighing]

40:24.583 --> 40:25.541
[sighing]

40:27.375 --> 40:29.750
[inhaling deeply, exhaling]

40:33.083 --> 40:33.916
[inhaling]

40:35.666 --> 40:36.500
[inhaling]

40:36.583 --> 40:38.916
Those were Murphy's guys
that shot up that car.

40:42.625 --> 40:45.750
I worked with Murphy, overseas.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.791
She helped me get a job
at the university and...

40:50.333 --> 40:52.000
helped me with rehab, too.

40:53.541 --> 40:56.083
She's a psychiatrist, Noah.

40:57.333 --> 40:58.458
Sleep expert.

40:59.583 --> 41:00.958
In the desert, she would...

41:01.708 --> 41:04.291
help set parameters for interrogation.

41:07.166 --> 41:09.416
Sleep deprivation, it was torture.

41:16.541 --> 41:17.875
They killed people.

41:22.458 --> 41:26.958
The kind of things that we would do
to try to find answers, it's not human.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.833
Are we still going to the hub?

41:33.416 --> 41:34.250
[sighing]

41:42.333 --> 41:43.208
Yeah.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.333
[Jill] Oh, my God.

42:40.416 --> 42:41.916
[tires squealing]

42:43.666 --> 42:44.750
[tires squealing]

42:47.291 --> 42:49.375
We're gonna need, like,
a book on mapping.

42:51.916 --> 42:52.833
[sighing]

43:03.250 --> 43:04.416
Hey, sweetheart.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.500
[Matilda] Hey.

43:07.791 --> 43:08.875
[Jill] You okay?

43:09.416 --> 43:10.291
[Matilda] Mm-hmm.

43:11.291 --> 43:12.166
[Jill] Come here.

43:12.708 --> 43:15.916
I-- I want to make sure
that you understand how this works, okay?

43:18.083 --> 43:19.791
Mom, I know how a library works.

43:19.875 --> 43:23.166
Yeah. The computers don't work anymore,
so...

43:23.250 --> 43:25.625
This is gonna be your new school.

43:26.208 --> 43:28.916
So, when mommy's gone,
you'll need to find a library.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.041
Okay? And... read. Don't stop reading,
and I...

43:32.125 --> 43:33.166
[breathes heavily]

43:34.250 --> 43:36.625
...and I need you to learn
as much as you can, okay?

43:36.708 --> 43:38.291
'Cause you are my smart girl.

43:39.166 --> 43:40.083
All right.

43:40.666 --> 43:41.833
All right. Um...

43:42.583 --> 43:44.541
Um, come with me over here.

43:44.958 --> 43:45.791
Here we go.

43:46.458 --> 43:50.166
Okay, look at me. I'm gonna teach you
something very important, okay?

43:50.458 --> 43:52.833
I need you to learn
how to shoot this gun, okay?

43:52.916 --> 43:56.750
And, look at me, not just for people,
but for animals too. All right?

43:56.833 --> 43:58.291
And we're gonna find you a rifle,

43:58.375 --> 44:00.125
and you're gonna learn
how to shoot that too,

44:00.208 --> 44:02.625
because the world
is different now, baby, okay?

44:02.708 --> 44:04.666
And you gotta be prepared for anything.

44:04.750 --> 44:06.416
All right? Here we go.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.750
Put two hands on the gun for me.
There you go.

44:09.208 --> 44:10.041
Okay.

44:10.791 --> 44:13.708
Hold onto it strong
just like the handlebars of your bike.

44:14.125 --> 44:17.708
Put this foot forward. There we go.
Nice strong stance, okay?

44:18.208 --> 44:20.666
Keep both eyes open.
And you see that eye groove?

44:20.750 --> 44:23.166
I want you to look right through that,
all right?

44:23.250 --> 44:24.500
Now focus, breathe.

44:24.583 --> 44:25.583
[shaky breathing]

44:25.666 --> 44:26.666
You can do this.

44:28.958 --> 44:29.916
I don't like guns.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.583
-Matilda, please.
-[Matilda] I don't want to.

44:32.666 --> 44:33.833
-You have to.
-No!

44:33.916 --> 44:34.791
-You have to.
-No!

44:34.875 --> 44:36.833
-Yes, Matilda!
-We're gonna find a cure, okay?

44:36.916 --> 44:38.666
And you and Noah are gonna shoot the gun.

44:39.583 --> 44:40.541
[Matilda gasping]

44:40.625 --> 44:42.250
[gunshots]

44:42.333 --> 44:43.250
[crying]

44:43.333 --> 44:44.416
[Jill] Now you do it.

44:45.666 --> 44:47.083
-Oh.
-[crying] I'm going to the car.

44:47.166 --> 44:48.416
Wait, baby. Baby, come--

44:49.041 --> 44:49.916
[Noah] Hey!

44:52.791 --> 44:54.125
Did you shoot at me?

44:55.125 --> 44:57.375
No. Noah, I thought you were in the car.

44:57.916 --> 44:59.916
I was here. I said I was here.

45:00.583 --> 45:01.875
Who's in the car, Noah?

45:01.958 --> 45:02.958
No one.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.916
You said to find books on mapping.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.291
[sighing]

45:08.375 --> 45:10.250
Just don't shoot at me again, okay?

45:13.916 --> 45:17.583
[Noah] I think the coordinates lead here.

45:20.041 --> 45:21.041
[Jill] Mmm.

45:22.166 --> 45:23.375
It looks like...

45:24.750 --> 45:28.041
it... it's 1,500 miles away?

45:28.125 --> 45:33.166
I think it's 150 miles. I don't know.
We haven't slept in four days.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.291
I-I wrote down the directions.

46:26.208 --> 46:27.041
I think.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.458
[thudding in the distance]

46:29.583 --> 46:30.791
[thudding continuing]

46:34.541 --> 46:35.416
[man 13] Hey!

46:36.666 --> 46:38.000
[Jill panting]

46:38.416 --> 46:40.416
Matilda. Come on.

46:40.500 --> 46:41.583
[panting]

46:43.500 --> 46:44.875
[tires squealing]

46:44.958 --> 46:46.666
No. No.

46:47.291 --> 46:49.083
[yelling] Stop! Stop!

46:51.250 --> 46:52.208
[man 14] Hey.

46:53.083 --> 46:55.875
I'm not stopping. I'm gonna hit you.
I'm not stopping.

46:55.958 --> 46:57.000
[tires squealing]

46:57.083 --> 46:58.125
[yelling] Fuck you!

47:04.000 --> 47:05.416
Hey, I ain't gonna hurt you.

47:06.625 --> 47:07.500
I ain't.

47:08.583 --> 47:09.583
I promise.

47:10.625 --> 47:13.000
Just, hey, let me have the boy.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.958
No, you can go. I'll let you go.
Hey, give me the boy.

47:17.958 --> 47:19.541
I'll let you-- I'll let you go.

47:22.041 --> 47:24.208
I'm just messing around.
I'm messing around.

47:25.250 --> 47:27.708
We're all free men here. It's all good.

47:31.083 --> 47:32.791
Hey, can I-- Can I have that gun?

47:32.875 --> 47:34.208
Noah, I'm gonna shoot at one.

47:34.291 --> 47:37.125
They're gonna scatter. You're gonna
go inside and lock yourself in, okay?

47:37.666 --> 47:38.541
Noah!

47:39.416 --> 47:41.875
-Noah!
-Hey, give me-- Give me the gun.

47:42.916 --> 47:44.083
Are you gonna shoot me?

47:46.041 --> 47:46.875
Go on.

47:47.333 --> 47:48.333
-Sweetheart--
-[gunshot]

47:48.875 --> 47:49.708
[men exclaiming]

47:56.333 --> 47:57.166
Noah, run.

47:57.416 --> 47:58.416
[yelling] Noah, run!

47:58.500 --> 48:01.250
Yeah, run, Noah, you pretty little bitch.

48:03.791 --> 48:05.291
[tires squealing]

48:05.708 --> 48:07.166
Hey, Mommy. Get in.

48:07.958 --> 48:09.458
-Get in, Mom, please.
-Get in!

48:10.708 --> 48:11.708
Yeah, get in.

48:13.166 --> 48:15.291
-Who are you?
-[man 15] Why does it matter?

48:16.500 --> 48:17.583
What is your name?

48:19.000 --> 48:22.041
-I said, "What's your name?"
-Dodge! Dodge, call me Dodge.

48:22.541 --> 48:24.208
How did you get out, Dodge?

48:24.791 --> 48:27.583
I was locked in the cells,
guards were gone, okay?

48:27.666 --> 48:30.500
We were starving, and I thought
that, you know, I was gonna die in there.

48:30.583 --> 48:32.541
And then the guards came back
and opened the cell.

48:32.625 --> 48:34.875
-[Jill] You just walked out?
-Yeah, I just walked out.

48:34.958 --> 48:37.291
-Where are you heading?
-I'm in a red fucking jumpsuit. Okay?

48:37.375 --> 48:38.958
I'm heading far away.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.833
-Far from here, okay?
-Watch out!

48:40.916 --> 48:42.583
-[Jill, Dodge grunting]
-[tires squealing]

48:43.458 --> 48:44.375
[Dodge grunting]

48:45.875 --> 48:46.833
[Dodge grunting]

48:47.250 --> 48:48.208
Ha!

48:48.291 --> 48:49.583
[pants, chuckling]

48:49.666 --> 48:50.875
[Dodge laughing]

48:50.958 --> 48:52.625
-[Dodge continues laughing]
-[engine idling]

48:52.958 --> 48:54.333
There are no bullets in that.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.250
What?

48:56.041 --> 48:57.750
There are no bullets in that gun.

48:59.708 --> 49:00.833
[engine turns off]

49:00.916 --> 49:03.000
I keep the keys. And we need gas.

49:03.083 --> 49:04.500
[door opening]

49:07.541 --> 49:08.583
No bullets, huh?

49:11.958 --> 49:12.791
Fuck!

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
Oh, my God.

49:18.291 --> 49:19.125
[Matilda] Mom?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.041
[Jill] Okay, that should be clean enough.

49:27.125 --> 49:29.708
So, you saw I put it in the gas tank,
right?

49:29.791 --> 49:33.125
And now I want you to just, um, suck on it
like a straw,

49:33.208 --> 49:34.375
but do it hard,

49:34.458 --> 49:37.416
and then when it comes out,
put the gas in the tank.

49:37.750 --> 49:39.458
You're gonna put it in here, okay?

49:44.041 --> 49:45.958
So your sister can sleep, huh?

49:51.750 --> 49:52.916
Where's your father at?

49:54.250 --> 49:55.166
[Noah sighing]

49:55.250 --> 49:56.083
He died...

49:56.750 --> 49:57.708
in the war.

49:57.791 --> 49:58.708
Oh, he served.

50:00.416 --> 50:01.291
Not bad.

50:02.791 --> 50:03.708
Not good either.

50:12.041 --> 50:13.666
[Dodge] Change of clothes, baby!

50:26.333 --> 50:27.375
Go on.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.125
Come on, you can do it.

50:29.708 --> 50:32.208
Come on, you gotta learn, Matilda.
You got this.

50:33.083 --> 50:34.833
[sucking]

50:36.750 --> 50:38.958
-[Jill] Oh! Oh.
-[coughing]

50:39.041 --> 50:41.458
-I drank it.
-Okay, baby. It's okay. It's all right.

50:41.541 --> 50:42.833
-Spit it out.
-[coughing]

50:43.541 --> 50:45.083
Hey, your mom's hardcore, man.

50:45.458 --> 50:48.833
[sighing] She's getting Matilda ready
in case we can't find a cure.

50:49.916 --> 50:52.416
-She thinks I don't know what she's doing.
-A cure?

50:54.458 --> 50:56.208
You guys are trying to find a cure?

51:06.041 --> 51:08.041
You know, the funny thing is,
I usually sleep, like,

51:08.125 --> 51:09.791
two to three hours tops at night,

51:09.875 --> 51:11.625
but now, you know...

51:13.375 --> 51:14.958
So, you're taking our car?

51:18.666 --> 51:20.541
Well, depends where you're heading.

51:23.125 --> 51:24.666
North. Lewisburg, right?

51:25.750 --> 51:26.666
[Dodge] Hmm.

51:28.458 --> 51:30.125
That's where I'm heading, too.

51:30.958 --> 51:31.791
North.

51:35.041 --> 51:36.833
You know, you should probably
hang onto it.

51:36.916 --> 51:39.291
You, uh, look pretty mean
pointing it at people.

51:39.375 --> 51:41.791
Just in case something happens.
[chuckling]

51:49.958 --> 51:53.291
[engine revving repeatedly]

51:55.125 --> 51:56.541
[Jill] That's good, baby.

51:56.625 --> 51:58.916
Remember, two hands on the steering wheel.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.375
Yes, I have two hands.

52:01.416 --> 52:03.916
Okay, I was just telling you
so you don't forget.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.250
You always say
I have a really good memory.

52:06.750 --> 52:09.583
-Why do you think I'll forget?
-Eyes on the road, please.

52:09.666 --> 52:11.375
Thank you.
[sighing]

52:11.458 --> 52:15.291
Fixing this car is gonna be so hard.
Oh, man. Okay.

52:16.125 --> 52:18.375
But there are books on that, okay?
You hear?

52:18.458 --> 52:20.958
Burn the books, man. Burn 'em all.

52:21.041 --> 52:23.250
-Don't need those anymore.
-Ah, eyes!

52:24.291 --> 52:26.791
Can you maybe just not--
Focus on the road, please.

52:26.875 --> 52:28.833
Not talk to her
so she can concentrate, please.

52:32.625 --> 52:35.375
[Dodge] Enough people said
that the Earth was flat,

52:35.458 --> 52:36.708
so the Earth was flat.

52:37.666 --> 52:39.958
Then, they said the Earth was round...

52:40.833 --> 52:43.125
so the Earth was round.

52:44.416 --> 52:45.833
The Earth is round.

52:47.291 --> 52:48.125
Prove it.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.750
[Noah] Science proves it.

52:50.833 --> 52:54.125
[Dodge laughing] Science?
And who understands the science, huh?

52:54.208 --> 52:56.000
Eyes on the road, please, always.

52:56.083 --> 52:58.000
[Dodge] Enough people talk
about something, right?

52:58.083 --> 52:59.208
Then it becomes fact.

52:59.291 --> 53:03.750
Then they put it in the books,
and then the book becomes fact.

53:03.833 --> 53:04.916
Then it's settled.

53:05.583 --> 53:09.166
Then no one understands it anymore,
no one even talks about it anymore.

53:09.250 --> 53:12.125
Fuck, this is why
we gotta burn the books, man.

53:12.541 --> 53:13.666
He said the F-word.

53:13.750 --> 53:15.666
I know. Please shut up.

53:15.750 --> 53:16.875
[Dodge, softly] Sorry.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.541
-She's a kid.
-Okay.

53:21.916 --> 53:24.583
You know, my grandmama,
you know what she used to tell me?

53:24.666 --> 53:26.458
-Huh?
-That all the world's problems

53:26.541 --> 53:28.541
could all disappear in one generation

53:29.333 --> 53:32.541
if every kid grew up
forgetting all the shit they were taught,

53:32.625 --> 53:35.166
the shit that doesn't make sense,

53:35.250 --> 53:37.708
but you're taught it enough times,
you believe it.

53:37.791 --> 53:39.708
Then we can actually live in a world

53:40.166 --> 53:41.666
where no one is starving...

53:43.666 --> 53:44.875
and everyone's equal.

53:44.958 --> 53:46.375
-Really?
-Whoa.

53:46.458 --> 53:48.000
[tires squealing]

53:50.458 --> 53:51.416
I'm sorry, guys.

53:56.041 --> 53:58.500
I used to think she was crazy, though,
Grandma.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.416
[Dodge laughing]

54:01.708 --> 54:03.083
Man, but now...

54:05.875 --> 54:07.458
maybe she was on to something.

54:09.791 --> 54:12.166
-Watch out. You see that there?
-[Matilda] Yeah.

54:12.250 --> 54:14.375
Go right around the car, just like that.

54:14.875 --> 54:15.708
Hey...

54:16.708 --> 54:18.750
Slow down. Slow down, put the brake on.

54:19.625 --> 54:20.791
[brakes squealing]

54:24.000 --> 54:25.041
What the fuck?

54:31.875 --> 54:32.708
Let's go.

54:32.791 --> 54:35.500
Let's go, let's go, let's go, right now!
Put your head down, Matilda!

54:35.583 --> 54:37.416
-Come on.
-[Dodge] Move, move!

54:37.500 --> 54:38.708
I'm trying, I'm trying!

54:38.791 --> 54:39.875
[tires squealing]

54:39.958 --> 54:41.208
-[crash]
-[Dodge yelling]

54:41.291 --> 54:42.375
[Jill] Watch out, Matilda!

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:51.291
Good. I can help you with that.

1:04:00.375 --> 1:04:01.875
You need to raise my daughter.

1:04:02.916 --> 1:04:05.166
I have a little girl. She's ten years old,

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:08.250
and she needs you to help her
in the new world.

I...

1:04:14.416 --> 1:04:15.458
-I can't--
-No.

1:04:15.541 --> 1:04:16.875
Is-- Why?

1:04:16.958 --> 1:04:18.416
She can't make it on her own.

1:04:19.041 --> 1:04:20.750
She needs somebody to help her.

1:04:20.833 --> 1:04:23.666
Okay? She needs someone to help her.
You're the only one who can do it.

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:27.416
In the next few days,
the rest of us are gonna be dead, okay?

1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.083
I'm gonna take you out of here.

1:04:29.166 --> 1:04:31.458
I'm the one that needs help.

1:04:31.541 --> 1:04:34.916
[inhales deeply] I was supposed to be dead
months ago.

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:37.875
You're crazier than the rest of them.

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:39.833
Jill?

1:04:41.958 --> 1:04:42.958
[Jill] Dr. Murphy.

1:04:43.916 --> 1:04:44.958
I, uh...

1:04:45.041 --> 1:04:46.958
-[Murphy] What are you doing here?
-[panting]

1:04:47.875 --> 1:04:48.916
I came to help.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.375
After you left the campus,
Brian helped me with the coordinates.

1:04:53.458 --> 1:04:54.291
Brian...

1:04:55.208 --> 1:04:57.041
My family, are-- are they with you?

1:04:57.416 --> 1:04:58.375
Oh...

1:04:59.916 --> 1:05:01.458
No, uh...

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:04.166
Brian was, um...

1:05:04.250 --> 1:05:07.333
I'm-- I didn't see him again.
So I'm assuming he was here.

1:05:07.416 --> 1:05:08.333
They're not here?

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:10.875
I'm sorry.

1:05:15.166 --> 1:05:16.000
Uh...

1:05:17.083 --> 1:05:18.083
Is there a cure?

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:22.625
It's been six days, and we're no closer.

1:05:22.708 --> 1:05:26.166
We have, um, a cocktail
that helps with mental acuity,

1:05:26.250 --> 1:05:27.916
but it's-- it's causing some...

1:05:28.583 --> 1:05:29.958
neurological damage.

1:05:30.041 --> 1:05:31.000
But it is...

1:05:31.083 --> 1:05:32.458
It's buying us some time.

1:05:34.750 --> 1:05:35.708
This morning, I...

1:05:35.791 --> 1:05:37.541
[inhaling deeply] I thought...

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:40.083
maybe the only answer...

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:41.416
[chuckling]

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:42.916
we're gonna get is...

1:05:44.333 --> 1:05:46.041
that none of us are gonna survive.

1:05:48.416 --> 1:05:49.291
But...

1:05:50.041 --> 1:05:51.625
you got here, right?
[chuckling]

1:05:51.708 --> 1:05:53.375
I mean, that must mean something.

1:05:54.958 --> 1:05:56.333
Get some meds...

1:05:57.291 --> 1:05:59.583
get situated, and let's get to work.

1:06:00.916 --> 1:06:02.208

1:08:11.708 --> 1:08:12.666
I can sleep.

1:08:14.250 --> 1:08:15.083
[crying]

1:08:15.166 --> 1:08:16.250
I can sleep.

1:08:17.375 --> 1:08:18.208
[sighing]

1:08:19.416 --> 1:08:20.250
[sighing]

1:08:28.333 --> 1:08:29.958
I can help people sleep?

1:08:30.666 --> 1:08:31.583
[Katz] Yes.

1:08:32.833 --> 1:08:35.500
And we need to find out
what makes you so special.

1:08:44.750 --> 1:08:46.000
Is he still alive?

1:08:46.083 --> 1:08:49.041
[Katz] Oh, yeah, she is still alive.

1:08:53.416 --> 1:08:54.500
We, um...

1:08:56.125 --> 1:08:58.583
had to ease the tension by...

1:08:59.416 --> 1:09:01.833
draining the cerebral fluid, but...

1:09:02.666 --> 1:09:04.125
that hasn't helped.

1:09:04.208 --> 1:09:07.791
A catch-22. The only way
to ease the tension is to drain the fluid,

1:09:07.875 --> 1:09:11.375
the only way to clean the brain
is the fluid.

1:09:13.333 --> 1:09:14.541
Can I touch her?

1:09:15.125 --> 1:09:16.000
[Katz] Sure.

1:09:16.708 --> 1:09:18.541
You're such a brave, sweet girl.

1:09:21.708 --> 1:09:23.541
[chimp whimpering]

1:09:28.833 --> 1:09:31.000
[whimpering]

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:40.875
[Katz] Ether.

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:43.833
Well, see?

1:09:45.333 --> 1:09:46.208
Nothing.

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:48.208
-[chimp whimpering]
-No effect.

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:51.916
Most animals are able to sleep...

1:09:53.125 --> 1:09:55.833
after the incident, but chimps, well...

1:09:56.583 --> 1:09:58.916
they were always closest to humans.

1:09:59.750 --> 1:10:00.625
[Murphy] Hi.

1:10:02.208 --> 1:10:04.708
I'm Dr. Murphy,
I'm-- I'm a friend of your mom's.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:08.208
Can she?

1:10:09.583 --> 1:10:11.125
[Katz] Uh, we're gonna, um...

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:13.875
try the ether on you now, Matilda.

1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:17.166
-To prove that you're special.
-[Matilda] Will it hurt?

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:19.833
[Katz] No, we're not gonna hurt you.
I'm a doctor.

1:10:20.333 --> 1:10:21.666
We don't hurt people.

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:23.375
[Murphy] Kinda weird, huh?

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:24.333
Yeah.

1:10:28.958 --> 1:10:30.666
[Murphy] Slow, easy breaths, babe.

1:10:32.458 --> 1:10:33.583
There you go.

1:10:33.666 --> 1:10:35.750
Nice and easy. It's okay.

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:41.291
Nice and easy.

1:10:52.875 --> 1:10:54.083
She sleeps.

1:10:56.541 --> 1:10:57.666
Poor thing.

1:11:02.666 --> 1:11:04.208
Amazing.

1:11:17.416 --> 1:11:18.458
[Murphy sighing]

1:11:19.041 --> 1:11:19.875
Hey.

1:11:22.416 --> 1:11:23.250
I...

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:25.416
I want to be disappointed...

1:11:26.708 --> 1:11:29.375
that you didn't tell me about Matilda

1:11:29.791 --> 1:11:31.583
after all I've done for you.

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:34.250
But, as a mother, I understand.

1:11:35.791 --> 1:11:36.833
[sighing]

1:11:38.625 --> 1:11:40.250
How long have I been here?

1:11:40.875 --> 1:11:41.708
Uh...

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:45.333
Eighteen hours.

1:11:47.708 --> 1:11:49.250
Why can she sleep?

1:11:50.250 --> 1:11:51.125
Who?

1:11:51.791 --> 1:11:52.958
[Murphy] Who? Matilda.

1:11:57.541 --> 1:12:00.000
Has she had any, um... any surgeries?

1:12:01.916 --> 1:12:03.458
How long have I been here?

1:12:10.833 --> 1:12:11.791
It was, um...

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:13.833
some sort of a...

1:12:13.916 --> 1:12:15.916
a solar flare, we think.

1:12:16.333 --> 1:12:19.375
It... changed our electromagnetic wiring.

1:12:19.458 --> 1:12:21.708
It affected our glymphatic system.

1:12:23.041 --> 1:12:24.166
Messed with our...

1:12:24.666 --> 1:12:25.666
our clocks.

1:12:26.333 --> 1:12:27.291
Matilda.

1:12:28.291 --> 1:12:29.208
Matilda.

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.583
Oh, please, let her go.

1:12:31.666 --> 1:12:33.500
Jill, your survival--

1:12:33.583 --> 1:12:36.875
Our-- Our survival depends on Matilda.

1:12:36.958 --> 1:12:37.833
Hmm?

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.208
Gotta keep trying.

1:12:39.291 --> 1:12:40.625
[Jill] Oh, no, please.

1:12:41.833 --> 1:12:44.333
Oh, no, please, please.
No, no, no, that's my baby.

1:12:44.666 --> 1:12:45.625
That's my baby.

1:12:45.708 --> 1:12:49.833
That's my baby girl. Please just take,
like, blood samples or something, please!

1:12:49.916 --> 1:12:51.125
[door opening]

1:12:56.208 --> 1:12:58.583
You really an electr-- electrician?

1:13:00.625 --> 1:13:02.958
[woman 13] Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

1:13:03.708 --> 1:13:07.833
It's a cocktail of anti-inflammatories,
stimulants, other things.

1:13:08.666 --> 1:13:10.166
It reduces the beta-amyloid.

1:13:11.208 --> 1:13:12.083
It'll help.

1:13:14.875 --> 1:13:18.666
Um, it's most effective
when injected near the brain.

1:13:19.833 --> 1:13:20.791
The carotid.

1:13:22.333 --> 1:13:23.166
Fuck that.

1:13:23.833 --> 1:13:24.833
Fuck--

1:13:24.916 --> 1:13:25.791
What--

1:13:30.125 --> 1:13:31.125
Okay.

1:13:34.416 --> 1:13:36.708
[labored breathing]

1:13:41.958 --> 1:13:44.208
[labored breathing continues]

1:13:48.750 --> 1:13:49.625
[Katz] Ah.

1:13:50.166 --> 1:13:52.541
-[Katz grunting]
-I think she stopped breathing.

1:13:52.625 --> 1:13:53.666
[Katz] Huh?

1:13:55.875 --> 1:13:58.541
Defib. Hey! I need your help! Okay.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:13:59.958
Okay, come on.

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:03.166
-I need you to press "charge."
-[Murphy] Okay.

1:14:03.250 --> 1:14:05.250
-[Katz] Okay? Charge.
-[Murphy] Ready. Charging.

1:14:05.333 --> 1:14:06.166
[Katz] Clear!

1:14:06.250 --> 1:14:07.083
You're hurting her.

1:14:07.166 --> 1:14:09.458
[Katz] We're trying to restart her heart.
Do it again.

1:14:09.541 --> 1:14:10.833
-[Murphy] Charging.
-[Katz] Clear!

1:14:10.916 --> 1:14:12.958
-[defibrillator beeping, shocking]
-[Katz] One more time.

1:14:13.041 --> 1:14:14.416
-[Matilda gasping]
-[Murphy] Charging.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:15.333
[Katz] Clear!

1:14:28.041 --> 1:14:29.916
[nurse] It's all the spiders in here.

1:14:30.541 --> 1:14:31.500
There's too many.

1:14:33.041 --> 1:14:34.625
That's why they're all melting.

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:36.958
We have to get rid of the spiders.

1:14:37.541 --> 1:14:39.375
-It's all the spiders in here.
-[Murphy] Well...

1:14:39.458 --> 1:14:42.208
Let's get her brother up here...
so we can compare them.

1:14:42.291 --> 1:14:43.958
-[nurse] There's too many.
-What?

1:14:47.208 --> 1:14:48.208
I have to save...

1:14:48.291 --> 1:14:50.125
[gasping] We need to save her.

1:14:51.625 --> 1:14:53.583
We... We need...

1:14:53.666 --> 1:14:55.583
-You lied to me.
-We-- We just--

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:57.958
[Noah] You wanted to find a stranger
to leave Matilda with.

1:14:58.041 --> 1:14:59.416
I guess that's what you do.

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:02.166
You rely on other people
to raise your kids.

1:15:02.250 --> 1:15:03.833
[screaming] No!
[gasping]

1:15:03.916 --> 1:15:05.583
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-Noah!

1:15:05.666 --> 1:15:08.541
Why did you bring me here? Why'd you
make me think it was just for me? Why?

1:15:08.625 --> 1:15:11.041
-I'm sorry. [gasping]
-[Noah] That doesn't mean anything.

1:15:11.125 --> 1:15:13.250
[screaming] Noah! Noah! Noah!

1:15:13.333 --> 1:15:15.458
[heaving] Noah, don't do this! Noah!

1:15:15.541 --> 1:15:17.458
[screaming] Please! Noah, please!

1:15:17.875 --> 1:15:20.666
-Don't!
-You? You're coming with us.

1:15:23.750 --> 1:15:25.958
Hey, you? You're coming with us.

1:15:30.916 --> 1:15:31.750
No.

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:33.708
No, no. No, no, no.

No, no, no, no, please!

Please, please, please!

[crying] Noah, please.

1:15:38.875 --> 1:15:42.333
No, don't take--
Don't take my other baby, please.

1:15:42.416 --> 1:15:44.625

They're losing their minds.

1:16:04.875 --> 1:16:05.958
She's okay? You're okay.

1:16:06.041 --> 1:16:07.875
You're okay. All right.

1:16:07.958 --> 1:16:09.583

If you move,
I swear I'll blow your fucking head off!
