00:08.176 --> 00:09.510
$5.

00:09.543 --> 00:13.581
(LAUGHING) What
are you, a wimp?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.949
Put your money
where your mouth is.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.685
All right, $10.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.586
You're a sucker.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.688
You're gonna lose.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.522
Get your turtle.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.262
[laughter]

00:29.397 --> 00:31.899
OK, on the count of three.
Ready?

00:31.932 --> 00:34.502
One, two, three.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.469
Come on, Lightning!

00:35.503 --> 00:37.138
Go down, Jerry.
Come on.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.639
- Come on, Lightning!
- Jerry, check it out.

00:38.672 --> 00:39.640
Jerry, look!

00:39.673 --> 00:41.109
Look, Lightning!

00:41.142 --> 00:42.110
Come on, Jerry!

00:42.143 --> 00:43.077
Come on, crawl, dammit!

00:43.111 --> 00:44.078
Crawl like the wind!

00:44.112 --> 00:45.579
Come on, Jerry!

00:45.613 --> 00:47.548
What are you doing?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.882
Baby versus turtle.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.185
Sport of kings.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.122
You're using our
baby brother for sport?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.623
That is sick.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.759
When he was asleep, we were
using him for third base.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.928
You're gonna
traumatize this kid.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.663
No, growing up
in this household

01:02.696 --> 01:04.532
is gonna traumatize the kid.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.834
Beating the turtle is his
only shot at self-esteem.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.102
[laughter]

01:08.136 --> 01:10.104
Come on, Jerry.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.239
You're lucky, Darlene.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.306
The kid was gonna lose.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.508
He didn't stand a chance
against Lightning.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.144
[laughter]

01:16.177 --> 01:19.147
As ridiculous as this
is, DJ, Jerry clearly

01:19.180 --> 01:20.681
could have beaten that turtle.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.416
Yeah, well, maybe
in a distance race,

01:22.450 --> 01:23.617
but not in a sprint.

01:23.651 --> 01:24.918
[laughter]

01:24.952 --> 01:28.689
My baby brother could mop
the floor with that reptile.

01:28.722 --> 01:33.294
Yeah, well, I got $10
that says otherwise.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.195
You're on.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.130
[laughter]

01:36.164 --> 01:37.097
Come on, Lightning!

01:37.131 --> 01:38.065
Come on.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.000
[interposing voices]

01:40.033 --> 01:40.968
Crawl, dammit!

01:41.001 --> 01:41.935
Crawl like the wind!

01:41.969 --> 01:42.836
Come here.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.372
Come on, Jerry.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.240
[laughter]

01:48.776 --> 01:50.244
Give me five on the turtle.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.745
[laughter]

01:51.779 --> 01:55.216
Come on, Lightning.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.899
DJ, DJ, what the
heck are you doing?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.535
The picture's all screwy.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.802
I'm just trying to fix it!

02:48.836 --> 02:51.472
Never, never punch a TV, son.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.275
There are tools for
situations like this.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.544
[laughter]

02:58.011 --> 03:00.080
Hey, everyone, guess what?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.114
Guess what?

03:01.148 --> 03:03.351
You cracked five feet four.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.552
[laughter]

03:04.585 --> 03:05.853
I got a job.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.721
I got a really great job.

03:07.755 --> 03:08.756
Call a mover.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.291
Call a really great mover.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.425
[laughter]

03:11.459 --> 03:12.993
I don't think you need
a mover for five sweat

03:13.026 --> 03:14.895
socks and a tear-stained diary.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.330
[laughter]

03:16.364 --> 03:18.232
Congratulations.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.101
Now nothing in this
world can hold you back,

03:21.134 --> 03:23.371
except your association
with this family.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.138
[laughter]

03:25.172 --> 03:26.907
I'm really proud of you, pal.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.609
Now if you save up for
a couple of months,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.544
you can get that studio
apartment you had your eye on.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.112
No, I don't even
need it anymore.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.481
That's the best part of the job.

03:33.514 --> 03:37.285
I have to work weekends, but
they provide meals and housing.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.053
David, you've become a priest.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.955
[laughter]

03:43.023 --> 03:44.224
No, it's even
better than that.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.260
I'm going to be
working at Edelweiss

03:46.294 --> 03:48.061
Gardens Amusement Park.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.129
Oh, wow!

03:49.162 --> 03:50.964
I mean, that's, like,
the coolest place

03:50.998 --> 03:52.266
in the whole state.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.967
Last year, a whole family
got crushed to death on one

03:54.001 --> 03:56.270
of those twirling beer steins.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.238
[laughter]

03:58.272 --> 03:59.640
That's how I want to go.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.141
[laughter]

04:01.174 --> 04:02.976
I met the recruiter
today at the mall.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.612
They interviewed me
on the spot and said

04:04.645 --> 04:08.148
that I was perfect
Edelweiss Gardens material.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.917
Rock on, [inaudible].

04:09.950 --> 04:11.218
[laughter]

04:11.251 --> 04:13.253
Well, remember how sad
we were last week when

04:13.287 --> 04:14.622
we had to leave Disney World?

04:14.655 --> 04:17.558
Now it's gonna be like I get
to live in an amusement park.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.727
You get to wear
shorts and knee socks.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.162
You won't look like too
much of a [inaudible]..

04:22.195 --> 04:24.465
[laughter]

04:26.467 --> 04:29.269
No, actually they said they
could probably find a place

04:29.303 --> 04:32.506
for me in their art department.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.274
I'm gonna go call Darlene,
and then I'm gonna leave

04:34.308 --> 04:35.809
notice at the pizza place.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.011
Hey, don't forget
your severance pizzas.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.947
[laughter]

04:39.980 --> 04:42.816
[music playing]

04:49.723 --> 04:51.725
Nice room, David.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.427
No windows to wash.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.497
Kind of like living in
an empty swimming pool.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.866
Yeah, with no
pesky distractions.

04:58.899 --> 04:59.767
Is it night?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.668
Is it day?

05:00.701 --> 05:01.669
Did I miss spring?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.404
[laughter]

05:03.437 --> 05:05.305
It used to be a Days Inn.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.341
Wow, they really
fixed this place up.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.676
[laughter]

05:08.709 --> 05:11.311
Don't these banks and
banks of fluorescent lights

05:11.345 --> 05:12.212
drain your energy?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.715
I think they give you energy.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.685
[laughter]

05:17.718 --> 05:18.952
Hi, everybody.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.087
I'm Doug.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.455
I'll be David's roommate.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.490
You must be David.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.724
Uh, yeah. hi.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.294
Oh, my, my, my, what
a fun-looking group.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.497
[laughter]

05:29.530 --> 05:31.632
It's not even noon yet,
and the kid's plastered.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.933
[laughter]

05:32.966 --> 05:35.736
Uh, this is Mr. And Mrs.
Conner, and this is Jackie.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.337
Oh, well, hi, everyone.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.572
It's great to have you here.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.840
But you should
know, in the future,

05:39.873 --> 05:42.843
there are no visitors allowed
in the men's residence.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.978
Oh, well, you don't
have to worry about that.

05:45.012 --> 05:45.813
David's not very popular.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.018
OK.

05:51.051 --> 05:54.588
Well, I'll go get your
Welcome to Edelweiss packet

05:54.622 --> 05:56.390
from Mr. Schlosser's office.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.025
Who's Mr. Schlosser?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.060
Oh, he's our chief instructor.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.328
He's terrific.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.597
And I'm not just saying
that because I have to.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.265
[laughter]

06:06.700 --> 06:08.602
Man, if he's not
employee of the week,

06:08.636 --> 06:09.970
I'd like to see who is.

06:10.003 --> 06:13.340
Hey, look, the guy
who founded the joint.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.545
I heard he had himself
frozen after he died.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.414
Remind me not to eat the
snow cones around here.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.815
[laughter]

06:21.849 --> 06:23.383
Well, you're gonna
be busy, David.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.620
You've got breakfast at
six, calisthenics at seven,

06:26.654 --> 06:29.356
animatronics repair
class at eight.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.793
You're gonna do more before 9:00
AM than most people do all day.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.061
Sounds pretty grueling, bud.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.029
Are you sure you just
don't want to get married?

06:36.063 --> 06:36.964
[laughter]

06:36.997 --> 06:37.865
Here you go, David.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.866
Everything you'll need.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.233
Hey, Doug.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.035
Doug, I was looking at
your itinerary there.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.003
I got to tell ya--

06:43.036 --> 06:43.804
You really
shouldn't read things

06:43.837 --> 06:45.606
on the wall in here, Jackie.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.908
[laughter]

06:48.976 --> 06:51.411
Say goodbye now, David.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.615
Smile practice in 15 minutes,
where you'll learn to be

06:54.648 --> 06:56.850
friendly to the customers.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.553
[laughter]

07:01.054 --> 07:02.756
Wow, it's amazing.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.391
It's like he's got
one regular smile,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.827
you know, and then
there's that one.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.295
[laughter]

07:08.328 --> 07:10.297
Man, David, you're gonna
be a busy boy around here.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.534
(CACKLING) David
can handle it.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.536
He's one of us now.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.737
There it is again.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.105
[laughter]

07:18.138 --> 07:22.142
Well, uh, I guess we
oughta get out of your hair.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.311
Yeah, you guys probably
want to take some time,

07:24.344 --> 07:25.646
get acquainted.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.315
You know, talk about your
girlfriends back in the states.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.083
[laughter]

07:30.117 --> 07:32.252
Well, uh, thanks for
helping me move in here.

07:32.285 --> 07:37.224
And thanks for, you
know, everything.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.426
We're still gonna be seeing
you all the time, David.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.061
Well, yeah.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.232
Yeah, now that you can get
us into the park for free.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.736
Or-- or even if we
have to pay, you know,

07:48.769 --> 07:51.004
because that'd be
darn well worth it.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.339
[laughter]

07:52.372 --> 07:53.173
We should go.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.178
You're gonna be OK
here, right, David?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.079
Oh, yeah.

07:59.112 --> 07:59.913
Sure.

08:04.284 --> 08:09.122
Uh, well, remember to,
uh, write to us every day.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.960
And don't forget to include a
photo of yourself holding up

08:12.993 --> 08:14.194
that day's newspaper.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.096
[laughter]

08:19.667 --> 08:23.003
[music playing]

08:28.075 --> 08:31.612
How do you get used to these
ties, and getting up so early?

08:31.645 --> 08:34.414
Oh, one sets one's mind to it.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.184
Simply a matter of
dominating the will.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.721
Oh, well, see, I'm
usually the dominatee.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.856
[laughter]

08:42.890 --> 08:44.825
Good morning.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.226
Morning, Mr. Schlosser.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
Good morning, Mr. Schlosser.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.797
[laughter]

08:49.830 --> 08:51.331
Are you fresh to our ranks?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.299
Uh, yes, sir.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.333
David Healy.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.905
Uh, ahoy, sir.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.673
And how are we fitting in?

08:59.707 --> 09:00.574
Oh, pretty good.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.474
Pretty good.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.776
Nice people.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.579
I've already met some of you.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.447
Couldn't tell you
which ones, but.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.549
[laughter]

09:09.583 --> 09:12.552
Thank you, Mr. Healy.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.624
Today's topic is
character assimilation.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.259
This is where you
learn not just to play

09:19.292 --> 09:24.564
but to be the park's signature
mascot, Hans the Hare.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.433
[laughter]

09:27.500 --> 09:29.369
(LAUGHING)

09:30.738 --> 09:31.605
Sorry.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.607
It's just that button nose.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.043
I couldn't help myself.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.378
Yes, Hans is very funny.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.313
(LAUGHING FAKELY)

09:40.347 --> 09:44.885
But remember, Hans is
not purely a comedian,

09:44.918 --> 09:48.756
like a Stan Laurel or a Sinbad.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.792
Hans is an all-around
entertainer.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.927
He sings.
He dances.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.428
He has a fitness video.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.197
[laughter]

09:57.230 --> 09:58.431
It's a full-body workout.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.599
It's wonderful.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.102
[laughter]

10:02.135 --> 10:07.775
Now that you've read your
Hans the Hare manual, tell me,

10:07.808 --> 10:12.946
what is this Hans doing wrong?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.683
Hans does not wave
constantly, but intermittently.

10:15.716 --> 10:16.583
Good!

10:16.616 --> 10:18.385
[laughter]

10:18.418 --> 10:21.889
Hans only spins clockwise.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.857
Excellent.

10:23.891 --> 10:29.096
David Healy, what is
Hans doing wrong now?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.432
Uh, his ears aren't
pointing to 10 and two?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.668
[laughter]

10:36.636 --> 10:39.639
Look, I'm sorry,
I didn't have time

10:39.673 --> 10:40.974
to read my manual last night.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.343
I was so tired after
those wind sprints.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.679
[laughter]

10:45.713 --> 10:48.015
Class, help Mr. Healy.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.584
Hans doesn't sit.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.554
A sitting bunny is an
invitation to mayhem.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.956
[laughter]

10:56.990 --> 10:59.960
Uh, listen, Mr.
Schlosser, I'm not

10:59.993 --> 11:01.294
sure I'm supposed
to be here learning

11:01.328 --> 11:02.362
about how to play Hans.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.031
I draw, I paint.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.633
I was told I was gonna
be in the art department.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.301
How many of you here
are on the waiting

11:08.335 --> 11:09.837
list for the art department?

11:12.539 --> 11:16.276
Mr. Healy, if you're having
second thoughts about joining

11:16.309 --> 11:20.047
the Edelweiss family, then
by all means vacate my room

11:20.080 --> 11:21.514
and leave.

11:21.548 --> 11:25.252
Vacate my room?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.486
Uh, no.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.521
No, Mr. Schlosser, I'll stay.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.223
I'll stay, and I'll
be the best damn--

11:30.257 --> 11:31.291
(GASPING)

11:31.324 --> 11:35.162
--darn-- Hans the
Hare there ever was.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.564
[laughter]

11:37.597 --> 11:40.400
[music playing]

11:44.371 --> 11:46.406
And I thought I was
done filling out forms

11:46.439 --> 11:47.808
when we got this prison job.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.142
Every day, they send
me something new.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.177
I get writer's cramp.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.344
[knocking on door]

11:51.378 --> 11:53.747
See if they got any
forms for workman's comp.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.248
[laughter]

11:55.282 --> 11:57.350
Hey, I heard
something on the news

11:57.384 --> 11:58.952
about these
government contractors

11:58.986 --> 12:01.354
getting all these
kickbacks, you know?

12:01.388 --> 12:02.790
Find out how that works.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.125
[laughter]

12:05.158 --> 12:06.059
Hi, Mrs. Conner.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.261
May I come in?

12:08.295 --> 12:11.999
I'm sorry, but we already
subscribed to "The Watchtower."

12:12.032 --> 12:13.733
What are you knocking for?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.903
Well, it's just that I haven't
lived here for two whole weeks.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.504
I don't want to be impolite.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.939
[laughter]

12:20.540 --> 12:23.710
May I remind you where
you are, young man?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.313
Just trying to be nice.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.782
At Edelweiss, we're supposed
to be nice all the time.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.284
I guess it just kind
of stuck with me.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.385
So how is everyone?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.653
[laughter]

12:33.686 --> 12:36.256
Oh, everyone is just fine.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.459
But I won't be till you
take off that stupid tie.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.762
I need it so I can shoot up.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.231
I'd really rather keep it on.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.899
Besides, I like looking nice.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.935
We have this little
Hans the Hare motto.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.303
My teeth brushed white,
clothes wrinkle-free, I'm

12:50.337 --> 12:52.572
Hans the Hare, and I love me!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.274
[laughter]

12:56.143 --> 12:57.878
Then we kind of hop
around a little.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.279
[laughter]

12:59.312 --> 13:00.881
You won't be doing that here.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.215
[laughter]

13:02.249 --> 13:04.918
What other stuff they
got you doing there?

13:04.952 --> 13:08.421
Well, first they had me
on the Crusades Adventure.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.291
But soon, I might be working
on the Fortress of Fun,

13:11.324 --> 13:14.094
or maybe even Das
Glass Bottom Boot.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
[laughter]

13:15.996 --> 13:17.764
Have they got any
adventures that don't

13:17.797 --> 13:19.967
have something to do with war?

13:20.000 --> 13:24.304
You know, like something happy,
like, uh, little bears or elves

13:24.337 --> 13:28.041
or-- you know, this is out of my
area, but you know what I mean.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.177
Well, I'm sure
there are other rides,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.545
but I don't know
the whole park yet.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.746
Well, you'd
better not let Hans

13:33.780 --> 13:34.915
the Hare find out about that.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.984
He'll give you some demerits.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.852
How did you know
about the demerits?

13:38.886 --> 13:41.254
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- No.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.755
All it takes is six
demerits, and then

13:42.789 --> 13:46.326
they send you to the Edelweiss
Correction School for a month.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.460
Correction School?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.329
What's that, some kind
of brainwashing camp?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.131
No No, it says right
on the brochure,

13:51.164 --> 13:52.699
this is not a brainwashing camp.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.067
[laughter]

13:54.101 --> 13:57.504
Yeah, and I put the correct
weight on my driver's license.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.906
Mrs. Conner, listen.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.141
This might not mean much to you,
but it's very important to me

14:01.174 --> 14:02.509
that I make this job work.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.643
Hey, David.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.912
Looking good.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.247
[laughter]

14:09.249 --> 14:10.317
I'm gonna go comb my hair.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.251
I'm feeling a little unkempt.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.456
Thank you for the
compliment, Mr. Conner.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.791
[laughter]

14:20.160 --> 14:23.063
Would you look at that?
Our David's turning into a man.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.464
No he's not.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.734
He's turning into some kind of
buttoned-down corporate rabbit

14:27.767 --> 14:29.002
robot.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.471
And the really scary thing
is, did you see that tie?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.672
It's not even a clip-on!

14:32.705 --> 14:33.673
[laughter]

14:33.706 --> 14:34.707
Come on, Roseanne.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.110
He's just trying to
be part of a team.

14:37.144 --> 14:40.213
Team sports made
me what I am today.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.449
[laughter]

14:42.482 --> 14:44.651
You make me what I am today.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.121
But team sports got
me ready for you.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.322
We've got to help him, Dan.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.457
No, we've got to let go.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.858
He's over 18.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.462
And remember, as much as we love
David, he's not really our son.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.464
Well, not according
to our last tax returns.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.399
[laughter]

14:59.432 --> 15:02.735
[music playing]

15:09.176 --> 15:10.110
Pardon me, Hans?

15:10.143 --> 15:11.078
Oh, hi.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.645
You can call me David.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.314
That's all right, Hans.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.284
You know, I've always had
a thing for Hans the Hare.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.120
I often dream that I'm
even married to Hans.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.589
I know that's silly.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.623
Or is it?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.993
[laughter]

15:29.496 --> 15:32.065
Team leader in the room.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.533
All right, everyone.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.935
We're expecting a
full park today.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.671
And I want to see a lot of
children with happy faces,

15:38.705 --> 15:40.040
because a happy face is--

15:40.073 --> 15:42.775
A repeat customer.

15:42.809 --> 15:48.982
People, today ends the
two-week probation period

15:49.016 --> 15:52.519
of our newest Hans the Hare.

15:52.552 --> 15:58.158
And in keeping with the grand
Edelweiss Gardens tradition,

15:58.191 --> 16:02.095
Hans, today your head
will be placed on

16:02.129 --> 16:05.965
by none other than the very
first ever Hans the Hare.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.800
[laughter]

16:13.606 --> 16:17.610
Never do anything
to disgrace the bunny.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.979
[laughter]

16:25.952 --> 16:29.356
Where's David Healy?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.991
How did you get past
the security goats?

16:32.025 --> 16:34.661
[laughter]

16:34.694 --> 16:36.963
Well, actually I
had no problem at all.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.767
Perhaps it was my
lucky rabbit's foot.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.669
[laughter]

16:42.702 --> 16:44.204
Ma'am, I'm going
to have to ask you

16:44.237 --> 16:45.438
to leave the magic rabbit hole.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.607
Pal, I'm going to have
to ask you to kiss my ass.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.942
[cheering]

16:51.010 --> 16:53.180
Which one of you is David Healy?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.950
They have no identity.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.719
They won't answer to
any name except the one

16:59.752 --> 17:02.389
we've given them.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.593
David Healy, the kid who
secretly hates animals.

17:06.626 --> 17:11.331
The kid who told me the
buffalo got what they deserved.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.600
Which one of you is David now?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.368
[laughter]

17:17.137 --> 17:18.004
Hans!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.106
Put your head back on!

17:19.139 --> 17:20.473
Don't do it, David.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.543
Once the head is on,
it does not come off.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.911
David, no!

17:24.944 --> 17:26.813
You don't know how many
pimply-faced teenagers

17:26.846 --> 17:28.415
have put their heads in there.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.117
[laughter]

17:30.150 --> 17:33.653
Hans, follow your training.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.787
I trained you first, David.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
Here, sniff my hand to remember.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.957
[laughter]

17:37.990 --> 17:40.460
Mrs. Conner, why
are you doing this?

17:40.493 --> 17:42.529
Why are you trying
to make me go home?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.231
Five words, David.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.832
You're dressed like a rabbit.

17:45.865 --> 17:46.933
[laughter]

17:46.966 --> 17:49.001
They're giving me a
job, a place to stay.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.670
I've been at your
house too long.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.406
But David, you don't have to
sell out everything you believe

17:53.440 --> 17:55.142
in just to pay the rent.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.709
I like it here.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.077
No, you don't, David.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.812
You just think you do
because it's so easy.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.414
They do all your
thinking for you,

18:01.448 --> 18:04.384
and they make all your
decisions for you.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.886
They say hop and
you say how high.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.054
Three inches.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.456
[laughter]

18:10.523 --> 18:12.058
Wake up, David.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.960
This place wants
to be Disney World,

18:13.993 --> 18:16.763
but it's just some
creepy fascist copy.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.432
I mean, today it's "Hi I'm Hans
the Hare, welcome to the park,"

18:19.466 --> 18:22.101
but tomorrow it's "I was
only following orders."

18:22.135 --> 18:23.536
[laughter]

18:24.637 --> 18:25.705
I don't know what to do.

18:25.738 --> 18:26.973
Well, I do.
You're gonna go home with me.

18:27.006 --> 18:27.874
Now.

18:27.907 --> 18:31.744
That is, if they let you.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.014
Of course Mr. Healy
is free to leave.

18:35.047 --> 18:39.852
All Edelweiss Garden employees
have complete freedom.

18:39.886 --> 18:44.524
You say they have
freedom, but do they really?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.494
Are they free after work
to go sit and have a beer

18:47.527 --> 18:50.563
and trash their boss like
you can on any other job?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.165
No.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.534
And yet this place
claims to represent

18:54.567 --> 18:56.436
what America stands for.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.605
[laughter]

18:58.638 --> 19:04.311
Well, my America stands for more
than $5 to park, $30 to get in,

19:04.344 --> 19:07.447
and $5 tasteless
bunny-shaped hamburgers.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.748
[laughter]

19:08.781 --> 19:11.318
Now, if you will
excuse us, David and I

19:11.351 --> 19:13.553
are going to get
in my crappy car,

19:13.586 --> 19:17.324
drive along that polluted river,
where we could get carjacked

19:17.357 --> 19:19.125
or forced off the
road by drunks,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.794
pull up in front of our house,
and run in before we are

19:21.828 --> 19:24.831
robbed, because that,
mister, is my America,

19:24.864 --> 19:28.235
and I thank God we're
free to enjoy it!

19:28.268 --> 19:30.169
[cheering]

19:30.203 --> 19:32.572
[music playing]

19:32.605 --> 19:35.375
[applause]

19:38.845 --> 19:39.879
No, Mrs. Conner.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.614
I want to go back
to Edelweiss Gardens

19:41.648 --> 19:43.316
so I can help people
have fun again.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.984
[laughter]

19:45.618 --> 19:46.519
All right.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.690
Let's go over this
one more time.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.492
[laughter]

19:53.693 --> 19:56.062
Your name is David Healy.

19:56.095 --> 20:00.367
You frown, you're
introspective, and you mope.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.868
I'm not listening.
I'm not listening.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.769
I'm not listening.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.736
I'm not listening.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.473
Listen to me, David.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.876
We don't whistle while we work.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.744
[laughter]

20:11.778 --> 20:14.581
We grumble and
complain and encourage

20:14.614 --> 20:16.015
others to do likewise.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.317
[laughter]

20:17.350 --> 20:18.385
- Oh, no, no, no, no--
- Yes!

20:18.418 --> 20:19.419
Yes!
Yes!

20:19.452 --> 20:20.753
--no!

20:20.787 --> 20:22.489
Let me tell you a little
something about your Edelweiss

20:22.522 --> 20:23.923
Gardens, David.

20:23.956 --> 20:29.262
It's mediocre food and
mediocre fun at best.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.597
And you know why I
know that, David?

20:30.630 --> 20:34.000
Because I'm an expert
on what is mediocre.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.468
[laughter]

20:35.502 --> 20:37.904
[hyperventilating]

20:39.506 --> 20:40.407
That's good.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.641
You hate me now,
don't you, David?

20:41.674 --> 20:42.542
Admit it.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.543
You're feeling hate.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.644
You hate me right
now, don't you?

20:44.677 --> 20:46.479
No.
No, no, no, I don't.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.115
You're a paying customer,
and I respect and admire you.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.450
[laughter]

20:51.318 --> 20:52.118
Liar!

20:55.955 --> 20:57.457
Break, damn you!

20:57.490 --> 20:58.625
Break!

20:58.658 --> 21:00.593
Listen to me, David.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.364
Rabbits and geese and
goats are not people.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.565
[laughter]

21:05.598 --> 21:07.867
They don't sing and dance.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.135
[laughter]

21:09.168 --> 21:10.136
They're food!

21:10.169 --> 21:11.638
(SCREAMING) No!

21:11.671 --> 21:14.073
[laughter]

21:15.642 --> 21:17.610
[sobbing]

21:17.644 --> 21:20.046
[laughter]

21:21.648 --> 21:23.716
There, there.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.084
[laughter]

21:26.185 --> 21:27.620
Welcome home, son.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.422
[laughter]

21:29.456 --> 21:30.623
[applause]

21:30.657 --> 21:34.193
[music playing]
