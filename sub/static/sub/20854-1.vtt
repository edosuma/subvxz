04:23.044 --> 04:25.381
What time did you get in last night?

04:25.481 --> 04:27.067
Late.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.403
You were snoring.

04:31.787 --> 04:35.208
- I don't snore.
- You do when you're stressed.

04:39.628 --> 04:41.515
He goes back to school today.

04:47.769 --> 04:49.623
They'll catch who did it.

04:52.073 --> 04:53.927
He could have been killed.

04:55.844 --> 04:59.333
Probably some stoned kids
being stupid with daddy's gun.

05:37.018 --> 05:38.823
Looks good to me.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.576
It's tragic.

05:43.859 --> 05:47.512
I don't know when that happened. Oh, well.

05:47.863 --> 05:49.382
Hey.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.252
Don't worry.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.172
I'll talk to him today.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.174
I wish he'd talk to me.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.079
He's been so quiet.

06:01.877 --> 06:04.414
Teenagers don't talk to their parents.

06:04.514 --> 06:06.366
They have a code of silence.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.904
He'll be fine.

08:34.062 --> 08:36.938
<i>Last call for Flight 806...</i>

08:55.717 --> 08:57.987
Hey, bud, you awake in there?

08:58.087 --> 09:00.506
Funny. Funny, Dad.

09:01.423 --> 09:02.945
Hey...

09:03.045 --> 09:07.471
...so, is Gramps,
is he gonna have a open casket?

09:08.831 --> 09:10.666
Closed casket.

09:10.966 --> 09:13.035
Why don't we just roast him?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.971
Oh, that's lovely.

09:16.011 --> 09:20.268
It's called cremation, and no, he's going
to be buried next to your grandmother.

09:21.260 --> 09:24.301
I think that Gramps would like
to have a viking funeral.

09:25.081 --> 09:27.683
- Viking?
- Yeah.

09:27.783 --> 09:30.668
I mean, he loved that stuff.
Like, you just, like...

09:30.768 --> 09:34.380
...put him on his boat,
and light it on fire and, you know...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.659
...send it out into the ocean.

09:36.759 --> 09:40.380
- Hey, there's an idea.
- That's one way to get rid of your boat.

09:44.712 --> 09:48.371
- Hey, drive him to school today?
- I was planning on it.

09:48.871 --> 09:50.906
- Love you.
- Love you too.

09:51.006 --> 09:53.509
- You working late?
- I hope not.

09:53.609 --> 09:55.745
You need to start thinking about that eulogy.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.730
I know, I will.

11:37.011 --> 11:39.228
I'm ready when you are.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.250
Shit.

11:43.350 --> 11:46.409
Dad, it... it doesn't matter, really.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.611
Dad, come on. Alright.

11:53.061 --> 11:54.874
I have an idea.

11:55.268 --> 11:57.325
What if I kept the boat?

11:58.100 --> 11:59.696
Yeah, why not?

11:59.796 --> 12:03.725
You live in the boat and I use
your bedroom as my second office.

12:03.825 --> 12:06.041
- Fine with me.
- I'm joking.

12:06.141 --> 12:08.208
Come on, we're gonna be late.

12:32.801 --> 12:35.405
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.191
See you later.

12:40.074 --> 12:41.410
Hey.

12:41.510 --> 12:45.882
Anytime you wanna talk,
we're here for you. Okay, bud?

12:46.882 --> 12:49.652
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.638
Thanks, Dad.

12:54.322 --> 12:56.175
See ya later.

13:01.731 --> 13:04.151
Sir, let's see some identification.

15:22.187 --> 15:26.238
<i>Badger, Tower One. We have
confirmation target has left the nest.</i>

15:26.338 --> 15:29.826
Roger that, Tower One. We're ten clicks away.

15:55.603 --> 15:57.820
<i>Badger, target has picked up the package.</i>

15:57.920 --> 16:01.121
Wait a sec. Shit.

16:03.094 --> 16:05.867
Tower One, Badger, we lost the link.

16:05.967 --> 16:09.551
- <i>Badger. Tower One, abort?</i>
- Negative, Tower One.

16:09.651 --> 16:12.305
Third time this month. Every time I'm back...

16:55.730 --> 16:57.743
Re-acquiring a link.

16:59.068 --> 17:00.954
It's gonna be tight.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.425
Tower One, Badger, we're back up.

17:31.459 --> 17:34.700
<i>Target traveling north
towards the main straightaway.</i>

17:34.800 --> 17:38.207
Speed, altitude, heading all good.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.359
Targeting.

17:54.689 --> 17:57.660
Target locked and we are on the straightaway.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.595
Tower One, Badger, are we clear to fire?

18:00.695 --> 18:04.453
<i>Badger, Tower One, roger that.
You are clear to fire. Take the shot.</i>

18:04.553 --> 18:07.820
Three, two, one.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.456
Rifle.

18:12.907 --> 18:15.762
- Impact in ten seconds.
- Holding target.

18:17.512 --> 18:21.951
Five, four, three, two...

18:29.924 --> 18:31.427
Splat.

18:32.527 --> 18:36.316
Tower One, Badger, partial hit on target.
Confirming kill.

18:42.537 --> 18:45.357
Wait, I think... I think I see movement.

18:51.846 --> 18:54.049
Wow, would you look at that.

18:54.149 --> 18:56.411
That's one tough dune coon.

18:58.156 --> 19:02.160
Tower One, Badger, kill is not confirmed.
Repeat, kill is not confirmed.

19:02.557 --> 19:04.914
Permission to fire second hellfire. Over.

19:05.014 --> 19:06.929
- <i>Affirmative, Badger.</i>
- 10-4.

19:07.029 --> 19:08.297
Still locked.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.921
Three, two, one.

19:12.601 --> 19:13.820
Rifle.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.036
Are you gonna be allowed
out of the house this weekend?

19:31.136 --> 19:34.523
- I'm busy with the funeral.
- Oh, Christ.

19:34.623 --> 19:37.302
I'm sorry, I forgot.

19:38.193 --> 19:40.080
It's okay.

19:43.397 --> 19:45.407
Have you ever written a eulogy?

19:46.301 --> 19:50.427
Yeah, actually I have.
For my uncle Stu's funeral.

19:50.527 --> 19:52.341
It did not go well.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.110
Why, what happened?

19:55.210 --> 19:59.224
I don't... just... okay.
He was kind of a miserable guy...

19:59.324 --> 20:02.328
...and, you know, he took it out on his wife
and his kids and everybody...

20:02.428 --> 20:06.622
...including me, so I said fuck it,
I just got up there and told it like it was.

20:06.722 --> 20:09.561
It was fucking hilarious. So...

20:15.497 --> 20:17.499
Were you born an asshole, Gary?

20:17.799 --> 20:19.801
Quite possibly, yeah.

20:19.901 --> 20:22.704
Look, you're gonna be fine.
Your dad was a stand up guy.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.632
Yeah, but...

20:25.159 --> 20:28.778
...how do you condense a man's
entire life into five minutes?

20:29.678 --> 20:31.813
There's probably an app for that, right?

20:31.913 --> 20:34.650
You, like, download a template,
put in his name...

20:34.750 --> 20:38.654
...and then boom, it writes it for you?
Might even give the speech for you?

20:38.754 --> 20:41.022
- Great, thanks.
- I don't know, ask Ellen.

20:41.122 --> 20:43.925
- Women are good at this kind of shit.
- She's doing too much already.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.063
Well, don't ask a guy. You know?

20:46.163 --> 20:50.447
We bury that shit for, like, 20 years
and then deal with it in therapy later.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.570
- <i>Guess what.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

20:55.670 --> 20:56.679
Hey.

20:56.779 --> 21:00.409
We're opening a new office,
right on Campbell Street.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.445
- Really?
- Yeah, right next to the college.

21:03.545 --> 21:05.414
Think about how good
our lunch dates would be then.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.369
Yeah, I think our... our lunch dates
are working pretty good right now.

21:12.186 --> 21:14.823
- I've been thinking.
- What?

21:14.923 --> 21:16.725
How about a weekend away?

21:16.825 --> 21:20.562
It can be a work thing. Right?
Like a conference or a workshop.

21:20.662 --> 21:23.734
- Whatever you want.
- I don't know.

21:25.134 --> 21:26.463
What do you mean, you don't know?

21:26.563 --> 21:28.837
- I don't know.
- Either we have something or we don't.

21:28.937 --> 21:31.955
Of course we do, Ted,
but a weekend away is a whole...

21:32.290 --> 21:34.109
Wake up next to me, Ellen.

21:34.809 --> 21:37.055
Spend an entire day with me.

21:39.714 --> 21:43.118
I thought we agreed no pressure. Right?

21:43.218 --> 21:45.054
I mean...

21:45.154 --> 21:46.957
...that was sort of the deal.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.546
Yeah, that was the deal.

21:50.492 --> 21:52.515
That was also three months ago.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.615
Ted.

21:57.298 --> 21:58.851
Ted.

22:07.508 --> 22:09.043
Ted!

22:09.143 --> 22:12.648
- Hey, Ted! Come on, please.
- You were very clear.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.567
Ted, come on.

22:15.783 --> 22:18.612
Please, don't be mad.

22:19.721 --> 22:21.522
Promise me you'll think about it.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.160
I'll think about it.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.146
I promise.

22:55.455 --> 22:57.692
<i>State Department spokesperson
Daniel Winters...</i>

22:57.792 --> 23:01.197
<i>...said this in last night's
emergency press conference.</i>

23:01.797 --> 23:04.766
<i>"Due to the latest release
of hacked NSA cables...</i>

23:04.866 --> 23:07.069
<i>...substantial damage has been done.</i>

23:07.869 --> 23:11.758
<i>We believe that these government personnel
have been put at potential risk...</i>

23:11.858 --> 23:14.710
<i>...because their names have been
compromised in this release.</i>

23:14.810 --> 23:19.048
<i>We will find those responsible
and they will be dealt with accordingly."</i>

23:19.948 --> 23:24.635
<i>In international news, the US launched
air strikes against an Isis stronghold...</i>

23:44.072 --> 23:47.523
Don't hit the slide, guys. Oh, here we go.

23:47.623 --> 23:50.379
Remember my rule, no hitting the bench.

23:50.479 --> 23:53.533
Let's go! Okay.

24:01.121 --> 24:03.408
I got it, I got it.

24:06.393 --> 24:08.129
There you go.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.998
Alright, yeah.

24:10.098 --> 24:12.233
Throw strong. Come on, son.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.903
Yeah, alright.

24:15.003 --> 24:16.855
Let's do this.

24:19.439 --> 24:22.777
- I haven't seen you around here before.
- I'm... I'm visiting.

24:22.877 --> 24:25.414
- Visiting?
- Yes.

24:25.514 --> 24:27.616
So, you waiting for someone, or...

24:27.716 --> 24:30.135
- Yes.
- You're meeting them here?

24:30.485 --> 24:34.517
No, I'm just enjoying the sunshine.
It's a lovely day.

24:35.256 --> 24:38.377
Hey, come on, remember what I said?
Catch it with your hand.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.346
Geez. I tell ya.

24:45.098 --> 24:46.969
It's a park for kids, mister.

24:47.869 --> 24:49.704
I like it here.

24:49.804 --> 24:52.959
I like to watch the children playing
with their mothers and fathers.

24:56.677 --> 24:58.247
Right.

24:58.647 --> 25:00.482
News flash, buddy.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.726
In this country...

25:02.826 --> 25:05.774
...we don't like strangers watching our kids.

25:05.874 --> 25:08.084
Especially strangers like you.

25:09.391 --> 25:10.913
So why don't you get lost?

25:12.633 --> 25:16.435
Why don't you go to a mosque
and read that little book of yours?

25:20.334 --> 25:22.137
I meant no offense.

25:22.237 --> 25:24.940
Well, I'm offended. Okay?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.892
So beat it.

25:38.519 --> 25:41.942
- Sorry if I ruined your day.
- Any time now.

26:43.551 --> 26:46.642
<i>"Confirm visual, I repeat, confirm visual.</i>

28:16.510 --> 28:18.079
Hey.

28:18.379 --> 28:20.181
You okay?

28:20.381 --> 28:21.901
Yeah.

28:25.285 --> 28:27.655
I thought you were gonna be here earlier.

28:27.755 --> 28:29.842
Yeah, traffic was a bitch.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.612
You... you can have the dresser.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.744
How's the eulogy coming?

28:51.746 --> 28:53.364
Harder than I thought.

28:56.284 --> 28:58.687
- You want me to write it?
- No.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.540
No, I said I would and I will.

29:14.735 --> 29:16.947
He dropped bombs on Hitler.

29:17.972 --> 29:20.824
Yet he died barely able to hold a crayon.

29:25.679 --> 29:28.324
I'm not ending up in a place like this.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.953
There's no guarantees in life, big brother.

29:32.053 --> 29:35.943
Hey, if I end up talking
to the walls, you shoot me.

29:36.043 --> 29:37.959
I mean it.

29:38.059 --> 29:40.279
Hey, did you see this?

29:42.250 --> 29:44.140
Charlie gave it to me.

29:44.833 --> 29:47.919
He was saying how Shane
would visit a couple times a week.

29:50.470 --> 29:52.524
You raised a good kid.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.745
I'm surprised he found the time.

29:56.845 --> 29:59.848
- You didn't know he visited pops?
- Sure, I knew.

30:00.648 --> 30:03.509
I just didn't think
he visited him that often.

30:05.119 --> 30:06.988
You sure didn't.

30:07.488 --> 30:10.292
Hey. Neither did you.

30:10.992 --> 30:14.631
Yeah. Well, I guess we both
dropped the ball there.

30:16.990 --> 30:18.572
Listen...

30:19.072 --> 30:21.287
...I know we don't talk a lot...

30:22.203 --> 30:25.491
...but I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

30:30.177 --> 30:31.978
And I'm here for you.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.953
That's what Dad would have wanted.

30:37.852 --> 30:41.622
Come on, give your little brother a hug.

30:41.722 --> 30:43.575
Come on.

30:47.562 --> 30:49.414
Come here.

31:00.774 --> 31:03.175
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

31:04.245 --> 31:06.114
I'll take care of it.

31:06.414 --> 31:09.185
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

31:10.385 --> 31:11.970
Yeah.

33:47.974 --> 33:49.143
Hey.

33:49.243 --> 33:50.796
Yeah?

33:54.948 --> 33:56.835
Hey, Dad.

33:57.617 --> 33:59.421
How was school?

34:00.021 --> 34:01.840
It was okay.

34:03.590 --> 34:05.459
Any updates?

34:05.559 --> 34:07.078
Nope.

34:10.530 --> 34:12.400
What game are you playing?

34:13.924 --> 34:16.001
Bullet Catcher IV.

34:19.973 --> 34:23.244
- I... I saw your uncle today.
- Dad, do you mind?

34:23.344 --> 34:26.290
I'm online here with a couple players.

34:31.484 --> 34:33.038
Sure.

34:39.092 --> 34:40.679
What?

34:42.495 --> 34:44.349
I... nothing.

35:47.927 --> 35:49.447
Shit.

36:15.755 --> 36:17.576
Can I help you?

36:21.995 --> 36:23.832
I said, can I help you?

36:24.732 --> 36:29.210
I was... I was passing by and I saw the sign.

36:30.704 --> 36:32.546
Oh, yeah?

36:33.607 --> 36:35.627
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

36:37.844 --> 36:39.731
Are you really interested?

36:47.520 --> 36:49.057
Yes.

36:49.857 --> 36:51.727
I am interested.

36:52.827 --> 36:56.965
I... I put an ad online,
must have been a month ago.

36:57.065 --> 36:59.367
To be honest, I forgot the sign
was still there.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.870
Yes, I... I read the ad actually.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.688
Great.

37:05.205 --> 37:08.493
- Want a closer look?
- Please.

37:12.212 --> 37:14.515
- "Amazing...
- Grace.

37:14.615 --> 37:17.068
- Grace.
- Grace, Yeah.

37:18.818 --> 37:20.706
"Amazing Grace".

37:26.960 --> 37:28.350
Are you...

37:28.450 --> 37:31.855
...you a sailor that keeps
the name of the boat?

37:33.601 --> 37:36.610
Amazing Grace is a perfect name.

37:38.372 --> 37:40.592
If I buy this I will re-paint it.

37:45.945 --> 37:48.623
May I ask why you're selling it?

37:49.049 --> 37:51.004
When my father...

37:51.104 --> 37:54.294
...couldn't manage it on his own
anymore, he gave it to me.

37:55.389 --> 37:59.558
- He's a generous man.
- Yeah, he was. He passed away recently.

38:03.997 --> 38:05.733
The cabin is in good shape.

38:05.833 --> 38:08.337
There's beautiful mahogany wood down below.

38:09.437 --> 38:12.390
She's much faster than you would expect.

38:14.641 --> 38:16.221
So...

38:16.752 --> 38:20.002
...one day you just decided
to jump into the deep end?

38:21.235 --> 38:24.217
- The deep end?
- Yeah...

38:24.617 --> 38:28.690
...looking at buying a boat like this,
you know? Out of... out of the blue?

38:29.490 --> 38:32.864
It was a boat from the blue, yes.

38:35.395 --> 38:38.733
Well, just so you know I'm asking 16...

38:38.833 --> 38:40.868
...16,000.

38:40.968 --> 38:44.038
- $16,000?
- Yes, $16,000.

38:44.638 --> 38:46.682
Are you firm on that price?

38:48.476 --> 38:50.285
What do you have in mind?

38:51.412 --> 38:55.081
Perhaps we can sit down and...

38:55.581 --> 38:58.252
...discuss a price that works for both of us?

38:58.852 --> 39:01.322
Yeah, why not?

39:01.722 --> 39:03.975
I'm Neil Wiston, by the way.

39:05.024 --> 39:06.794
Imir.

39:06.894 --> 39:08.413
Shah.

39:09.930 --> 39:14.102
Beth, Ted's been calling every 20 minutes,
I don't know what to do.

39:14.202 --> 39:17.137
<i>A weekend away? We're talking serious risk.</i>

39:17.237 --> 39:20.369
Right. I know, but I think
I'll lose him if I don't go.

39:20.469 --> 39:22.510
<i>And that doesn't set off warning bells?</i>

39:22.610 --> 39:24.813
Okay, I got it. You don't think I should go.

39:24.913 --> 39:28.616
<i>Honey, listen to me.
Right now you and Ted have a thing.</i>

39:28.716 --> 39:32.153
<i>If you go away with him, it's not a thing
anymore. It's a different thing.</i>

39:32.253 --> 39:35.323
<i>Don't go down that road
unless you're absolutely sure.</i>

39:39.376 --> 39:41.196
<i>Are you there?</i>

39:42.296 --> 39:43.382
Yeah.

39:47.668 --> 39:49.217
<i>Ellen?</i>

39:50.382 --> 39:51.939
<i>Are you okay?</i>

39:52.039 --> 39:54.675
Hey! Hey!

39:54.775 --> 39:58.178
Come here! Get back here!

39:58.278 --> 40:01.715
Get back here! You little fuckers!

40:01.815 --> 40:03.384
No!

40:03.684 --> 40:05.203
Hey!

40:12.393 --> 40:14.212
Oh, my God.

40:16.129 --> 40:17.698
Beer?

40:18.148 --> 40:19.967
Thank you.

40:20.067 --> 40:23.137
I wasn't sure if alcohol was allowed.

40:23.237 --> 40:24.872
Haram.

40:24.972 --> 40:26.774
Haram, right.

40:26.974 --> 40:30.257
And it's been a long time
since I was in a mosque.

40:30.357 --> 40:33.520
So you're not a... you're not a practicing.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.834
Not a practicing one, no.

40:42.088 --> 40:44.058
This must be your son.

40:44.858 --> 40:46.573
That's him. That's Shane.

40:47.962 --> 40:49.764
How old?

40:50.064 --> 40:53.680
16. Smart kid. Takes after his dad.

40:56.470 --> 40:59.925
May I ask what you do for a living?

41:01.575 --> 41:03.443
I'm in IT.

41:03.755 --> 41:05.291
Computers.

41:06.844 --> 41:09.340
Jesus Christ, my laptop!

41:17.790 --> 41:19.300
Shit.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.696
I hope this wasn't my doing.

41:22.296 --> 41:24.635
No, no. I'm...

41:25.340 --> 41:27.705
...I'm trying to write my father's eulogy.

41:28.702 --> 41:30.538
It's driving me crazy.

41:31.038 --> 41:33.107
Were you and your father close?

41:34.107 --> 41:36.189
Yeah, I like to think so.

41:37.611 --> 41:39.480
I need a good opening.

41:39.980 --> 41:42.985
Once I get that, then the rest will follow.

41:44.685 --> 41:47.340
Maybe you should start
with a childhood memory.

41:47.988 --> 41:51.649
Speak to who your father was,
not what he accomplished in his life.

41:52.292 --> 41:54.968
Oh, I got plenty of sailing stories.

41:55.996 --> 42:00.501
My brother Dave and I spent every weekend
on the boat when we were kids.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.246
There. You've got your opening.

42:04.538 --> 42:06.607
May I make another suggestion?

42:07.307 --> 42:08.826
Sure.

42:11.310 --> 42:15.684
In my humble opinion, allow the story
of your father to have true meaning.

42:18.585 --> 42:20.088
True meaning?

42:20.988 --> 42:25.213
I was taught the dead live on in three ways.

42:25.552 --> 42:29.597
Through their good deeds, through the
charity other people give in their name...

42:29.697 --> 42:31.499
...and, most important...

42:32.099 --> 42:35.607
...through the knowledge they leave behind
in this world that benefits others.

42:41.047 --> 42:42.877
That's beautiful.

42:43.577 --> 42:45.396
Thank you.

42:47.980 --> 42:49.850
I hope I was helpful.

42:49.950 --> 42:51.769
Yeah, you were.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.535
My wife, I...

42:56.933 --> 43:00.148
- I gotta give her a hand. Do you mind?
- Of course.

43:17.193 --> 43:20.514
- What happened?
- Baseball. Kids.

43:20.614 --> 43:24.017
- Jesus. You okay?
- I know. Yeah, I'm fine.

43:24.117 --> 43:26.638
- You should have called me.
- I'm fine, really.

43:29.255 --> 43:31.709
- Hey.
- Hello.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.650
I'm Imir Shah.

43:35.428 --> 43:38.250
- You must be Shane.
- Yeah.

43:39.565 --> 43:43.661
- My dad around, or...
- Yes, he's outside.

43:43.761 --> 43:45.651
Greeting your mother.

43:47.040 --> 43:50.912
I'm here to talk about buying the boat.

43:51.612 --> 43:54.698
- That was my granddad's boat.
- I know.

43:55.649 --> 43:57.518
You sure you wanna buy it?

43:58.018 --> 44:00.053
You don't think I should?

44:00.153 --> 44:03.224
Well, I don't know, I mean,
it's just an old boat.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.543
Hope it doesn't have termites.

44:22.575 --> 44:24.006
- Hello.
- Hi.

44:24.106 --> 44:27.675
- Ellen, Mr. Shah.
- I hear you're interested in the boat.

44:27.775 --> 44:31.434
- I am. Please, call me Imir.
- It's nice to meet you.

44:31.534 --> 44:33.956
I'm gonna put these down and grab
a drink. Would you like something?

44:34.056 --> 44:36.324
- No, thank you.
- He already has a beer.

44:36.424 --> 44:39.507
I also have real Masala Chai tea,
if you'd rather.

44:39.607 --> 44:42.630
- That sounds lovely, thank you, Ellen.
- Great. Sure.

44:43.130 --> 44:45.616
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

44:50.637 --> 44:52.906
You really do have a beautiful home.

44:53.006 --> 44:56.477
- Thank you.
- Yeah, we're... we're working on it.

44:56.877 --> 44:59.146
You're coming home from work, is that right?

44:59.246 --> 45:00.447
Yeah.

45:00.547 --> 45:03.651
She teaches at the... community college.

45:03.751 --> 45:05.819
And what do you teach?

45:05.919 --> 45:08.189
I teach comparative cultures.

45:08.989 --> 45:12.296
- You're an anthropology teacher.
- Ethnology, actually.

45:12.626 --> 45:16.029
- You must have read Levi Strauss.
- Do you know his work?

45:16.129 --> 45:19.800
I was under the impression his ideas
were central to ethnological methodology.

45:19.900 --> 45:22.938
Well, in structuralism, yeah. A bit out
of fashion these days. Why, are you an...

45:23.038 --> 45:26.095
Anthropologist? Unfortunately, no.

45:26.373 --> 45:30.934
I'm a computer engineer. My father
threatened to pull me out of Oxford...

45:31.034 --> 45:32.713
...if I switched disciplines.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.649
Oxford? God, I'd love to study at Oxford.

45:35.749 --> 45:39.259
It's not nearly as glamorous as
the brochures and films make it seem.

45:39.359 --> 45:42.256
We should probably get back
to the business at hand.

45:43.350 --> 45:45.242
I'll take it.

45:46.492 --> 45:49.124
The boat. I accept your price.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.999
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

45:52.099 --> 45:54.235
- What was the price?
- Sixteen.

45:54.535 --> 45:57.138
Great. Great.

45:58.538 --> 46:01.642
I... don't want to change your mind, but...

46:01.742 --> 46:04.212
...I thought we were gonna negotiate.

46:05.112 --> 46:07.348
Well, you seem like honest people.

46:07.848 --> 46:11.118
I'm sure what you're asking
is a fair market price.

46:11.218 --> 46:13.453
- Thank you. That's nice, yeah.
- That's nice.

46:13.553 --> 46:15.556
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Thank you.

46:15.656 --> 46:17.508
I hope you enjoy it.

46:29.235 --> 46:33.493
This tea would not be out of place at a cafe
in Karachi, Ellen. It tastes like home.

46:33.593 --> 46:35.457
That's sweet of you.
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

46:35.557 --> 46:37.998
Imir's been helping me write Dad's eulogy.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.214
Really?

46:40.814 --> 46:43.717
- I'm surprised he mentioned it to you.
- Hey, I was surprised, too.

46:43.817 --> 46:46.620
What can I say? Imir enlightened me.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.374
What was it you said?
Start with a childhood memory?

46:50.474 --> 46:53.360
Something that speaks to who Dad was...

46:53.460 --> 46:56.163
...not what he accomplished in life.

46:56.263 --> 46:59.166
There's my opening. A sailing story.

46:59.266 --> 47:01.303
But it's gonna have a life lesson.

47:02.469 --> 47:04.234
Something Dad taught me.

47:05.205 --> 47:07.675
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you stay for supper?

47:07.775 --> 47:11.467
- Honey, I'm sure he's got other plans.
- We can talk some more.

47:12.045 --> 47:14.323
As it happens, I don't.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.817
- I would love to share a meal with you.
- Great. Great.

47:17.917 --> 47:19.753
- Yeah.
- We'll celebrate the sale of the boat.

47:19.853 --> 47:23.285
I'll fire up the barbie.
What do you want? Steak?

47:23.385 --> 47:25.442
Actually I don't eat meat.

47:25.542 --> 47:27.817
- What else do we have?
- Salmon? Do you like salmon?

47:27.917 --> 47:29.842
- I do, yes. Thank you.
- Ellen?

47:29.942 --> 47:32.499
I'll have salmon, too. And if you're
doing a steak, do one for Shane.

47:32.599 --> 47:34.485
Surf and turf it is.

47:57.724 --> 47:59.577
Pearly whites.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.296
A lot of money in braces.

48:02.396 --> 48:05.398
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey. This is Mr. Shah.

48:05.498 --> 48:09.569
- He's buying our boat.
- Yeah, yeah. We met earlier.

48:09.669 --> 48:12.005
Hey, what time's dinner?

48:12.105 --> 48:14.542
I think I will be ready in about a half hour.

48:14.942 --> 48:17.978
Cool. I'm just gonna go out for a bit, so...

48:18.278 --> 48:19.822
Okay.

48:21.682 --> 48:23.250
That's Shane.

48:23.350 --> 48:27.054
- He doesn't seem very happy, does he?
- Oh, I don't know. I think...

48:27.154 --> 48:29.890
He has a face my teenaged daughter
would sometimes make.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.461
Right, well... teenagers, right?

48:32.961 --> 48:37.196
I mean, his grandfather just died,
so that's probably part of it.

48:37.631 --> 48:39.867
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

48:39.967 --> 48:41.732
No, it's...

48:44.337 --> 48:46.340
Do you mind if I use the loo
to wash my hands?

48:46.440 --> 48:49.480
Oh, God, yeah, sure, but the one
down here doesn't work, of course.

48:49.580 --> 48:51.645
You'll have to go upstairs.
It's just down the hall.

48:51.745 --> 48:53.598
Thank you.

51:36.875 --> 51:38.696
What's this?

51:44.350 --> 51:46.179
David gave it to me.

51:47.787 --> 51:50.757
Did you know Shane was visiting
Dad twice a week?

51:50.857 --> 51:53.878
No. He didn't say anything.

53:10.202 --> 53:12.223
I'll see you in Valhalla, Gramps!

53:33.359 --> 53:35.439
- Where's Shane?
- I don't know.

53:35.539 --> 53:38.004
He said he wanted to go out for a little bit.

53:38.898 --> 53:41.268
I'm gonna put a tracking device on that kid.

53:41.368 --> 53:43.469
Can't you track him with GPS?

53:43.569 --> 53:45.538
I hear a lot of American parents
are doing this.

53:45.638 --> 53:47.708
Yeah, I was actually joking.

53:49.464 --> 53:54.047
Yeah, I do know some parents
have this new tracking app.

53:54.147 --> 53:57.801
Paranoid parents, which we're not.
Don't give him any ideas, please.

54:00.552 --> 54:03.590
So where... where exactly are you from, Imir?

54:03.690 --> 54:05.072
Karachi.

54:05.172 --> 54:08.167
The city of lights.
How long have you been in the States?

54:08.267 --> 54:10.830
I just arrived. I'm starting a new contract.

54:10.930 --> 54:14.679
- Oh, yeah? What do you do?
- Systems integration. I'm a programmer.

54:14.779 --> 54:19.830
Listen, I... I don't wanna change
the subject, but maybe we...

54:19.930 --> 54:22.943
...could discuss how you plan
to pay for the boat.

54:24.443 --> 54:27.936
I can... arrange a bank transfer...

54:28.311 --> 54:30.389
...tomorrow if that's alright.

54:32.285 --> 54:35.706
- I don't see why not.
- Yeah. Perfect.

54:37.224 --> 54:39.726
Hey, bud. Glad you could make it.

54:39.826 --> 54:45.565
Sorry, Dad. Hey, actually is it okay
if I just eat in my room?

54:45.665 --> 54:48.718
- No, that's rude. Sit down.
- Hey, Neil.

55:09.822 --> 55:12.865
Growing boys eat like their limbs are empty?

55:14.060 --> 55:17.764
What's the American term for it? Chow down?

55:17.864 --> 55:21.505
Yeah. It's a... military expression.

55:22.469 --> 55:24.288
For eating.

55:32.879 --> 55:34.248
It's work.

55:35.148 --> 55:37.001
Excuse me.

55:48.126 --> 55:51.197
- Yeah?
- <i>Bad timing?</i>

55:51.297 --> 55:53.754
My steak's getting cold. What do you want?

55:54.634 --> 55:57.470
Play nice. I'm doing you a favor here.

55:57.570 --> 56:01.795
Security briefing at 07:00 tomorrow, okay?
Attendance is mandatory.

56:02.175 --> 56:03.744
Security?

56:04.644 --> 56:07.312
- Why? What's up?
- <i>It's the leak.</i>

56:07.812 --> 56:11.348
Head office is flipping the fuck out
over the gun sight videos.

56:11.448 --> 56:15.455
Some Geneva convention bullshit
about non-military combat missions.

56:16.155 --> 56:18.191
How does that affect the program?

56:19.091 --> 56:23.308
<i>Because if the press finds out we're
contractors, they're gonna shut us down.</i>

56:25.130 --> 56:27.000
It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

56:27.100 --> 56:29.736
Just... I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

56:29.836 --> 56:31.418
Yeah.

56:43.215 --> 56:45.552
- Sorry about that.
- Was that Gary?

56:45.652 --> 56:47.754
- Yeah.
- What'd he want?

56:47.854 --> 56:50.557
One of the servers is down
so I'm in early tomorrow.

56:50.657 --> 56:54.944
What a shock. Honestly, if we made time and
a half for all the hours he works overtime...

56:55.044 --> 56:59.098
...we'd be rich. It's 9-5 one day,
it's graveyard shift the next.

56:59.198 --> 57:01.084
It's completely crazy.

57:05.537 --> 57:07.560
- Can I be excused now, please?
- You may.

57:07.660 --> 57:10.777
How about I get us some dessert?
Some cheesecake?

57:10.877 --> 57:15.505
I've never had American cheesecake.
I hear it doesn't even taste like cheese.

57:17.884 --> 57:21.933
Hey, Shane. Go help your mom with the dishes.

57:25.824 --> 57:27.981
Are we saving this for anything?

57:28.828 --> 57:31.050
We're gonna toast the sale of the boat.

57:32.831 --> 57:35.402
Perhaps we should include
your grandfather in the toast.

57:35.802 --> 57:38.238
Yeah, I like that idea.

57:43.609 --> 57:45.692
You have a big heart, Imir.

57:47.847 --> 57:49.740
If it wasn't for Dad...

57:50.583 --> 57:54.222
...we wouldn't be standing here, would we?

57:55.522 --> 57:57.341
I suppose not.

57:59.331 --> 58:03.067
Pop Grove. 2012. That was a good year.

58:03.167 --> 58:06.806
First and last time I won
my fantasy six football pool.

58:07.967 --> 58:09.968
In 2012...

58:10.068 --> 58:12.331
...I had been working abroad for two years.

58:13.039 --> 58:15.808
I hadn't seen my family in all that time.

58:15.908 --> 58:18.477
- That's tough.
- It was.

58:18.577 --> 58:21.439
We would video chat but it wasn't the same.

58:21.548 --> 58:25.169
I missed this. Family meals.

59:03.121 --> 59:07.026
Nine hacks of classified files,
four attacks on NSA firewalls.

59:07.126 --> 59:09.496
We should have picked him up
at the Seattle airport.

59:09.596 --> 59:11.448
It's not my call.

59:13.065 --> 59:16.486
<i>Rover, this is Canary.
We have a match in your vicinity.</i>

59:23.692 --> 59:25.495
Hey, stop here.

59:31.283 --> 59:34.254
The house belongs to a private contractor.

59:34.354 --> 59:36.043
He works for us.

59:36.423 --> 59:38.208
Are you kidding me?

59:41.193 --> 59:43.317
A toast to new friends.

59:43.997 --> 59:47.734
To fair weather sailing on the water and off.

59:47.834 --> 59:49.288
Fair weather sailing?

59:49.388 --> 59:51.538
Hey, don't interrupt.
I'm just getting started.

59:51.638 --> 59:54.506
- He is not famous for his toasts.
- Yeah, no kidding.

59:55.108 --> 59:57.177
To everyone's health.

59:57.557 --> 59:59.374
Including financially.

01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:03.587
And lastly, to my father.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.940
For as long as I can remember
he loved the sea.

01:00:10.657 --> 01:00:12.584
And he loved that boat.

01:00:13.793 --> 01:00:15.299
Imir...

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:20.059
...we're passing on a piece
of Wiston family history to you...

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:23.055
...and I know we've only just met but...

01:00:23.155 --> 01:00:25.557
...I think my dad would approve.

01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:28.041
Because you're a good man.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:30.977
Thank you. I am honored.

01:00:31.077 --> 01:00:33.212
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:00:33.312 --> 01:00:35.311
- Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:37.000
Cheers.

01:00:39.851 --> 01:00:41.922
Why don't you give me your plate?

01:00:43.022 --> 01:00:44.829
So, Imir...

01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:47.661
...it must be so hard to be away from home?

01:00:47.761 --> 01:00:50.062
When do you get to see your family again?

01:00:50.162 --> 01:00:51.694
Soon.

01:00:53.366 --> 01:00:56.105
The last time I shared a family meal...

01:00:56.205 --> 01:00:58.639
...my daughter was about your age.

01:00:59.939 --> 01:01:01.534
Nazarene.

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:05.232
She was having some trouble in school.

01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:09.982
See, before we moved to Karachi
she had never been in a co-ed school.

01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:12.913
She had never been around boys her own age.

01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:16.182
And the other girls knew this,
and they would tease her and shame her.

01:01:16.282 --> 01:01:19.075
- My God.
- I tried to talk to her...

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.653
...nothing I said made any difference.

01:01:22.729 --> 01:01:25.398
I felt like I was helpless.

01:01:25.698 --> 01:01:27.767
Like I had failed as a father.

01:01:27.867 --> 01:01:31.270
I think... I think all parents
feel that from time to time.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.586
- Yeah.
- Perhaps.

01:01:35.408 --> 01:01:39.045
A few days later they went to Miranshah
to visit with some relatives.

01:01:39.645 --> 01:01:42.115
I couldn't go,
I had to stay in the city for work.

01:01:42.215 --> 01:01:44.704
Miranshah is in Waziristan, right?

01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:47.320
On the Afghan border where the Taliban are?

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.988
Among other things.

01:01:49.088 --> 01:01:51.824
But, yes, the Pakistani Taliban.

01:01:52.924 --> 01:01:56.996
So there's two different types of Taliban?

01:01:57.096 --> 01:01:58.866
It's complicated.

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:02.578
It is complicated, isn't it?

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.905
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:08.937
We want the world to be black and white.

01:02:09.242 --> 01:02:11.445
Good guys, bad guys.

01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:15.518
So often in the real world
that's not the case.

01:02:16.382 --> 01:02:17.707
You see...

01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:21.821
...Waziristan is a tribal area.

01:02:21.921 --> 01:02:25.592
Very conservative, very religious.

01:02:26.192 --> 01:02:28.618
They treat their women like cattle.

01:02:31.197 --> 01:02:33.332
I'm sorry, have you been there?

01:02:33.432 --> 01:02:35.669
Can't say that I have, no.

01:02:36.569 --> 01:02:39.973
But I was in New York a week after 9/11.

01:02:40.573 --> 01:02:42.793
Seemed pretty black and white to me.

01:02:50.015 --> 01:02:52.189
Dad, can I have another glass of wine please?

01:02:52.289 --> 01:02:55.540
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Sure. No, it's a celebration, Ellen.

01:03:05.697 --> 01:03:07.384
My wife...

01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:12.098
...is very well-respected in
my family and my community...

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.812
...and we built a very happy life together.

01:03:15.912 --> 01:03:17.897
Yeah, of course.

01:03:18.077 --> 01:03:19.933
Of course.

01:03:21.113 --> 01:03:23.082
What's her name?

01:03:23.182 --> 01:03:25.384
- Fatima.
- It's beautiful.

01:03:25.484 --> 01:03:27.360
She was.

01:03:28.394 --> 01:03:30.120
There's no beauty in death.

01:03:32.023 --> 01:03:33.877
I'm so sorry.

01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:38.831
Wherever she is, she's with Nazarene.

01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:40.754
They died together.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.254
Oh, my God.

01:03:45.972 --> 01:03:48.307
- What happened?
- It's... I don't think we should...

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:50.476
No, it's alright.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.470
They were struck by a missile.

01:03:55.513 --> 01:03:57.516
That's... awful.

01:03:57.616 --> 01:03:59.619
It was awful.

01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:02.286
So, I mean...

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:06.077
...who fired... who fired the missile?

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:10.029
A drone aircraft belonging to the CIA.

01:04:10.129 --> 01:04:11.931
That's horrible.

01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:15.101
Were they just...

01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:17.904
...just in the wrong place at the wrong time?

01:04:18.004 --> 01:04:19.806
Yeah, must have been.

01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:21.841
They weren't the only ones.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.542
I ask you, what is the right place?

01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:27.848
The men they are attempting to kill
are constantly surrounded by civilians.

01:04:29.048 --> 01:04:33.146
So, I mean, did the CIA,
did they think that the civilians...

01:04:33.246 --> 01:04:35.809
...were Isis or...

01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:38.157
I don't care what they thought.

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.494
Only what they did.

01:04:41.894 --> 01:04:44.363
Well, whatever...

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:47.333
...whatever it was they were trying to do...

01:04:48.534 --> 01:04:51.538
...the US government does not
fire indiscriminately.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:55.175
Well, perhaps the CIA has a different
definition of "indiscriminate".

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.476
<i>Well, yeah...</i>

01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:02.582
<i>...mistakes happen.</i>

01:05:03.582 --> 01:05:06.286
<i>But I think it's easy to...</i>

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.294
<i>...you know, take things
out of context. I mean...</i>

01:05:09.394 --> 01:05:11.774
<i>...sometimes we don't know
the bigger picture.</i>

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:14.470
<i>Perhaps the bigger picture is that...</i>

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.882
<i>...in the border regions civilians
have been living...</i>

01:05:16.982 --> 01:05:20.066
<i>...under the threat of these
bomb strikes for a decade.</i>

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.535
Children are afraid to go to school.

01:05:22.635 --> 01:05:24.703
Public gatherings of any kind are avoided...

01:05:24.803 --> 01:05:27.239
...all because America
thinks it's above the law.

01:05:27.339 --> 01:05:33.179
I don't understand. Why is the US
firing missiles into civilian territory?

01:05:33.279 --> 01:05:36.716
- I mean, that doesn't seem...
- Very good question, Shane.

01:05:36.816 --> 01:05:39.690
- Maybe Neil has the answer.
- Hey, everyone, I don't think we should...

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.154
Let's just not get into this
right now, please.

01:05:42.254 --> 01:05:44.457
No, hey, it's just discussion.

01:05:44.557 --> 01:05:48.870
Okay, but I think it's enough.
I think it's enough. Look...

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:51.203
I can't... I can't...

01:05:51.303 --> 01:05:53.482
...even imagine how you feel...

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.854
...and we are all...

01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:58.138
- ...so sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

01:05:58.238 --> 01:06:01.103
- We are. Of course.
- Of course we are.

01:06:01.203 --> 01:06:02.775
Thank you, Ellen.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:06.913
And I'm sorry, this is... it's not a topic
of conversation for your dinner table.

01:06:07.013 --> 01:06:09.275
I've been wholly inappropriate.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:16.092
Today's just not a good day for me.
It's the anniversary of their deaths.

01:06:44.482 --> 01:06:47.736
Ellen, why don't you go make some coffee?

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:51.241
Yeah. Okay.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.892
Would you like some more tea?

01:06:53.992 --> 01:06:57.841
- Actually coffee sounds good.
- Okay. Give me a hand?

01:06:58.297 --> 01:06:59.816
Yeah.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.285
Oh, my God. That was...

01:07:17.385 --> 01:07:20.786
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:24.657
He's obviously distraught and Dad's
obviously had too much to drink.

01:07:24.757 --> 01:07:27.619
- It's a bad combo.
- Mom, I mean, really...

01:07:27.719 --> 01:07:30.951
- ...we're just talking, it's not a big deal.
- No, you know what? We're done talking.

01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:34.867
Okay? We're gonna serve this coffee
and call it a night. Now get me the cream.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.519
Fine.

01:07:48.279 --> 01:07:51.190
So what happened to the CIA guy?

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:53.285
Happened?

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:55.421
Nothing ever happens to them.

01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:57.959
He simply continued on with their work.

01:08:04.446 --> 01:08:06.333
I gotta take this.

01:08:10.035 --> 01:08:14.341
So, the military, they just allow that?

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:21.180
- Talk to me.
- Alright, I checked the logs.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.415
We flew a sortie into Miranshah.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:26.352
<i>One year ago today. What was the target?</i>

01:08:26.952 --> 01:08:29.287
<i>Some Al-Quaeda bomb-maker
in the middle of town.</i>

01:08:29.388 --> 01:08:31.620
Hellfire strike outside his house, right?

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:34.563
You see, Shane...

01:08:34.662 --> 01:08:38.015
...some drone pilots aren't even soldiers.

01:08:38.116 --> 01:08:40.419
They don't come within 1,000
kilometers of the battlefield.

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:44.370
They work in their secure cubicles,
essentially playing a video game.

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:47.859
The only difference is in this video game
the victims are real.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.301
Do you remember any collateral damage?

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:52.858
Possibly, but we didn't have
boots on the ground...

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:55.581
<i>...so if there was a body count
we couldn't verify it.</i>

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.488
They come home...

01:08:58.122 --> 01:09:00.176
...to their families...

01:09:00.276 --> 01:09:02.321
...after a long day of murder...

01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:04.456
...and put their children to bed.

01:09:04.555 --> 01:09:09.229
It's so easy to divorce what they do
from real life consequences.

01:09:10.362 --> 01:09:12.165
I didn't know that.

01:09:12.665 --> 01:09:14.849
- Some coffee?
- Thank you.

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:17.475
- Cream and sugar?
- No, it's fine like this. Thank you.

01:09:17.576 --> 01:09:20.206
<i>Could this information
have come out in the leak?</i>

01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:22.930
Wait, is that what you're worried about?
Ellen finding out?

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:25.711
- No, not her.
- <i>Okay, then who?</i>

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:27.723
Just answer the question, will ya?

01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:32.151
I don't know, maybe, but it's a stretch.
Why? What's this about?

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.502
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:09:35.486 --> 01:09:37.374
I'll call you in the morning.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.064
Listen, we should probably go over the
spec on the boat and the registration.

01:09:55.164 --> 01:09:57.594
Can I see you in my office for a minute?

01:10:32.277 --> 01:10:34.680
I don't know what kind of game
you think you're playing...

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.316
...but I want you out of my house right now!

01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:39.818
Will you threaten
with physical violence if I refuse?

01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:43.737
Trust me, you do not want to go there.

01:10:44.256 --> 01:10:47.344
I must admit, you're not
what I expected, Neil Wiston.

01:10:50.795 --> 01:10:51.990
I'm calling the police.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:54.386
- You won't do that.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

01:10:54.486 --> 01:10:57.704
Because of what I've got in my
briefcase sitting in your kitchen.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:10:59.757
And this detonator.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:05.409
Do you know how much high explosive
is in a hellfire missile, Neil?

01:11:08.896 --> 01:11:11.354
<i>Almost 20 pounds. I googled it.</i>

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:15.168
Dammit.

01:11:15.987 --> 01:11:18.634
- Canary? This is Rover.
- Oh, shit.

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:23.018
Code red. I repeat, Code red.
Target has a possible explosive device.

01:11:23.595 --> 01:11:25.572
In a few minutes...

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:29.101
...it'll be exactly one year
from the moment of my family's death.

01:11:35.806 --> 01:11:39.111
- What do you want?
- In time.

01:11:39.211 --> 01:11:41.030
Give me your phone.

01:11:43.848 --> 01:11:45.668
Give it.

01:11:56.127 --> 01:11:57.430
Look...

01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:00.479
Look, your family is dead.

01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:04.536
I know, and I'm sorry. I really am.

01:12:04.636 --> 01:12:07.740
But... I don't know what the hell
you think that has to do with...

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.908
You know exactly
what this has to do with you.

01:12:10.008 --> 01:12:12.504
I told you! I write code for a living!

01:12:12.604 --> 01:12:14.472
Stop lying!

01:12:16.882 --> 01:12:18.884
Your government data breach, Neil.

01:12:18.984 --> 01:12:22.020
It opened up a back door
to your drone program.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.308
To your flight logs and ultimately
to where we're standing right now.

01:12:26.058 --> 01:12:27.881
So from now on...

01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:30.304
...you will tell the truth...

01:12:30.404 --> 01:12:32.842
...to me and to them.

01:12:40.638 --> 01:12:42.691
Yeah, okay.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:53.670
Mom?

01:12:55.686 --> 01:12:58.141
Mom? You gonna get that?

01:13:17.942 --> 01:13:21.455
Oh, good. Everything all settled then?

01:13:21.555 --> 01:13:26.002
Do they ever show you pictures
of the innocents you kill, Neil?

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.429
I've got your things.

01:13:32.591 --> 01:13:34.611
Are you a dutiful wife, Ellen?

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.264
Sorry? What?

01:13:38.864 --> 01:13:40.899
Do you respect your husband?

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:44.487
My relationship with my husband
is none of your business.

01:13:48.573 --> 01:13:50.439
Now is the time to be honest.

01:13:50.539 --> 01:13:53.650
Is there something
you want to tell your husband?

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:58.571
- Please...
- Neil...

01:13:58.671 --> 01:14:01.144
...your wife is seeing another man.

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:04.198
What... why are you...

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.894
- ...why are you saying this?
- Because it's the truth.

01:14:08.994 --> 01:14:10.546
Mom?

01:14:11.553 --> 01:14:12.691
Neil.

01:14:13.141 --> 01:14:17.354
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this? Please...

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:22.808
- What is this, you sick fuck!
- I learned this from you.

01:14:22.908 --> 01:14:25.476
I put you under the same surveillance
you put my country under...

01:14:25.576 --> 01:14:29.615
...with your satellites
and your drones. So no more lies.

01:14:30.682 --> 01:14:34.754
Or shall I tell your wife
and your son who you really are?

01:14:35.654 --> 01:14:37.212
Neil?

01:14:38.624 --> 01:14:41.027
I don't work for Lyker Surveys.

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:44.591
- What are you talking about?
- Actually...

01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:47.699
...there is no Lyker Surveys.

01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:49.601
- Not really...
- What do you mean?

01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:53.371
- It's just a cover.
- A cover?

01:14:54.371 --> 01:14:57.175
- Are you an undercover cop?
- No.

01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:59.611
- A criminal? What?
- No, I'm not a criminal.

01:14:59.711 --> 01:15:01.552
That's a matter of opinion.

01:15:03.515 --> 01:15:05.061
I...

01:15:06.219 --> 01:15:10.022
...I'm a... I'm a contractor for the CIA.

01:15:10.122 --> 01:15:12.124
- The CIA?
- Yeah.

01:15:12.224 --> 01:15:15.894
- As in the Central Intelligence Agency?
- Look, I couldn't tell you the truth...

01:15:15.994 --> 01:15:18.997
- ...because what I do is classified.
- I'm your fucking wife!

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:21.374
- Then we're all lying!
- Tell me the truth!

01:15:21.474 --> 01:15:26.237
- Dad, what do you do?
- I told you, I fly UAV's. Drones.

01:15:27.872 --> 01:15:31.377
What would be classified
about aerial mapping?

01:15:31.477 --> 01:15:34.281
Please tell me it's just maps.

01:15:37.982 --> 01:15:41.126
I've been part of a test program for...

01:15:41.226 --> 01:15:44.024
- ...contracted covert missions.
- Oh, my God.

01:15:44.124 --> 01:15:48.440
The US Air Force uses UAV's
to target enemy movements.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.467
Just like the military. We do everything
we can to minimize collateral damage.

01:15:52.567 --> 01:15:56.432
No. No! You do not get
to reduce it to collateral damage!

01:15:56.532 --> 01:15:58.970
They are people! With names!

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:02.164
Nazarene. Fatima. They have names.

01:16:02.264 --> 01:16:04.242
Okay, be careful.

01:16:04.342 --> 01:16:05.971
Careful.

01:16:06.071 --> 01:16:08.513
Okay, Shane, let's go.

01:16:08.613 --> 01:16:09.762
- Neil.
- Ellen. Ellen!

01:16:09.862 --> 01:16:13.018
- No! No!
- Ellen! Come here! Sit down!

01:16:13.118 --> 01:16:15.004
Sit down!

01:16:23.628 --> 01:16:27.165
We do what he says, okay? We do what he says.

01:16:27.265 --> 01:16:29.068
Is that a bomb?

01:16:29.468 --> 01:16:30.636
Is it?

01:16:30.736 --> 01:16:34.190
I'm so sorry that you're involved in this.

01:16:36.408 --> 01:16:39.577
Hey, Shane! Come here! Sit down!

01:16:39.677 --> 01:16:41.563
Sit down!

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:45.117
Go. Answer it.

01:16:45.217 --> 01:16:47.070
You get the door.

01:16:47.885 --> 01:16:49.605
Go.

01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:52.709
It's going to be okay.

01:17:03.067 --> 01:17:05.062
What's up with all the shouting?

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:08.860
Parent-kid stuff.
Shane's being a pain in the ass.

01:17:10.475 --> 01:17:11.677
What are you doing here?

01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:15.805
Well, you hung up on me so we were
never able to finish our conversation.

01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:19.485
Listen, I... I'm sorry about that.

01:17:20.185 --> 01:17:23.722
It's just not a good time, Gary.
I'm sorry. Okay?

01:17:23.822 --> 01:17:27.258
Oh, right. Well, I'm just trying
to figure out what was so important...

01:17:27.358 --> 01:17:29.327
...about that particular mission.

01:17:29.427 --> 01:17:31.297
Forget about it.

01:17:31.597 --> 01:17:33.449
Forget about it?

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.034
Okay. Okay.

01:17:38.134 --> 01:17:41.727
- How long we been partners, now?
- I don't know.

01:17:41.827 --> 01:17:44.043
- Three years?
- Yeah. Three years.

01:17:45.543 --> 01:17:49.181
And I know when you're spooked.
And you're spooked, okay?

01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:51.021
Look...

01:17:52.184 --> 01:17:56.313
...when you called about
the security briefing and the leak...

01:17:56.413 --> 01:18:00.273
...I... I got to thinking a little,
I just got a little freaked out...

01:18:00.373 --> 01:18:02.778
- ...but it's all good now.
- You got a little freaked out?

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.386
Yeah.

01:18:05.831 --> 01:18:07.561
Gary...

01:18:07.661 --> 01:18:10.685
...I swear, you're reading
way too much into this.

01:18:10.785 --> 01:18:12.137
- Am I?
- Yes, you are.

01:18:12.237 --> 01:18:14.673
- Am I?
- Yes.

01:18:15.173 --> 01:18:16.726
Okay.

01:18:20.344 --> 01:18:23.545
- Who's that?
- Oh, our neighbour. He...

01:18:24.512 --> 01:18:27.921
...he saw Shane bust up
Ellen's windshield with a baseball.

01:18:30.121 --> 01:18:33.211
- Yeah, I saw that.
- Yeah, Shane was lying about it, so...

01:18:33.311 --> 01:18:36.751
- Acting like a little shit?
- Yeah, dumb shit.

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:41.459
Okay. You're okay then?

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:45.402
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay. Alright. Well...

01:18:45.702 --> 01:18:49.423
...why don't we have a little pow wow
before the meeting in the morning.

01:18:49.523 --> 01:18:51.228
Tomorrow. Yeah, okay.

01:18:51.328 --> 01:18:54.530
And tell Shane to fly straight
or I'm gonna kick his ass.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.070
- You hear that, Shane?
- Yeah, yeah, he heard it.

01:18:58.950 --> 01:19:02.439
- Alright.
- Yeah, you got it. Have a good night.

01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:08.778
You are a painfully good liar, Neil.

01:19:33.718 --> 01:19:36.279
Are there any other secrets
we should discuss?

01:19:38.456 --> 01:19:40.859
Dad, there's something
that I need to tell you.

01:19:40.959 --> 01:19:44.102
Shane, you don't have to do this!
You tell him nothing!

01:19:44.462 --> 01:19:48.116
- Don't tell him anything!
- I was there, Dad.

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:50.235
When Granddad died.

01:19:50.335 --> 01:19:54.339
He squeezed my hand
and he hadn't done that in months.

01:19:54.439 --> 01:19:57.309
And then he looked at me and he knew me.

01:19:57.409 --> 01:19:59.486
And then...

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:01.647
...he stopped... he stopped breathing.

01:20:01.747 --> 01:20:03.849
I could have gotten a nurse.

01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:06.691
I didn't feel like that was what he wanted...

01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:09.911
...so I just... I left him there
for them to find him.

01:20:10.011 --> 01:20:13.692
I guess I didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to feel guilty...

01:20:13.792 --> 01:20:15.489
...for not being there.

01:20:15.589 --> 01:20:19.481
You should have been there, Dad.
You should have been there.

01:20:20.999 --> 01:20:23.271
That's a very good confession, Shane.

01:20:25.671 --> 01:20:27.891
But the guilty should never be spared.

01:20:32.877 --> 01:20:35.283
<i>Visual ID confirmed.</i>

01:20:38.749 --> 01:20:41.597
Have you ever felt real guilt, Neil?

01:20:44.121 --> 01:20:46.758
When you look at those people below...

01:20:46.858 --> 01:20:50.888
...and you take their lives,
do you feel anything?

01:20:53.063 --> 01:20:54.895
What do you want?

01:20:57.268 --> 01:20:59.371
Do you want a confession?

01:20:59.471 --> 01:21:00.973
Fine.

01:21:01.473 --> 01:21:04.722
Me and the guy who just left,
we killed your family.

01:21:04.822 --> 01:21:06.412
Satisfied?

01:21:07.412 --> 01:21:09.558
- Not at all.
- Hey, come on.

01:21:09.658 --> 01:21:13.735
You want revenge, don't you?
You want revenge.

01:21:14.185 --> 01:21:17.789
Come on, give me your best fucking shot.
Take it out on me!

01:21:17.889 --> 01:21:19.975
But let them leave!

01:21:22.393 --> 01:21:25.567
- Who said anything about revenge?
- Well, why else would you be here?

01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:27.699
Haven't you listened to anything I've said?

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:30.836
I'm listening. I'm listening.

01:21:31.336 --> 01:21:34.541
Please tell us how we can help you. Tell us.

01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:37.889
I've lost everything.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.477
I'll never see my family again.

01:21:42.948 --> 01:21:44.549
There's nothing left for me here.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:47.886
You're upset, you're not thinking clearly,
but this... no, you don't want this. Please.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.762
- I am thinking clearly.
- Please. Please, please, please.

01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:53.799
I'm thinking of how they were taken from me.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.864
I'll do anything you want.

01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.696
But please let them leave.

01:22:01.265 --> 01:22:03.085
I miss them so much.

01:22:09.232 --> 01:22:11.495
I miss them so much.

01:22:21.018 --> 01:22:24.460
Please, Imir, let them go.

01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:29.913
Just... just let them leave.
I'll do anything you want, please.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:33.765
Just let them leave. Just let them go.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:35.684
I'm sorry.

01:22:38.974 --> 01:22:40.770
Now's the time, Neil.

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:47.563
No target.

01:22:48.313 --> 01:22:50.966
Shane! Shane!

01:22:52.883 --> 01:22:54.887
No visual on detonator.

01:22:55.087 --> 01:22:56.973
<i>Hold positions.</i>

01:23:00.425 --> 01:23:01.977
Hey!

01:23:14.438 --> 01:23:16.291
Get off me!

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:42.155
Now you... understand, Neil.

01:23:54.178 --> 01:23:55.632
No.

01:24:02.419 --> 01:24:04.256
You're not gonna die!

01:24:05.156 --> 01:24:06.709
No!

01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:15.583
No!

01:25:45.105 --> 01:25:47.525
<i>In the wake of the recent NSA data breach...</i>

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:51.245
<i>...private drone contractor
Neil Wiston has come forward...</i>

01:25:51.345 --> 01:25:54.449
<i>...with more information
on the CIA test program...</i>

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:58.386
<i>...that blurs the line between
contractors and the military.</i>

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:03.090
<i>Ironically, as a private contractor,
Mr. Wiston may be held responsible...</i>

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:07.862
<i>...for any civilian casualties during these
previously autonomous combat missions.</i>

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.272
<i>Some folks may call Wiston a patriot...</i>

01:26:10.372 --> 01:26:13.300
<i>...but I have no doubt
he is a traitor to this country...</i>

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.637
<i>...and will be charged with these crimes.</i>

01:26:16.437 --> 01:26:20.174
<i>Serious damage has been done
to programs of national security.</i>

01:26:20.274 --> 01:26:23.244
<i>This is the danger of whistleblowers
like Neil Wiston.</i>

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:25.431
<i>They make our nation vulnerable.</i>
