Well, he's lying.

00:17.099 --> 00:20.334
The son of a bitch
has been playing us
the whole time.

00:20.402 --> 00:22.169
Whoa, easy!
No, I didn't say--

00:22.237 --> 00:23.737
You really think
we're that dumb, huh?

00:23.805 --> 00:26.240
Easy! I didn't say!
I didn't--!

00:26.852 --> 00:28.519
No! No!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.602

01:03.255 --> 01:06.357
Expenses and overtime
are two areas we should
really take a look at.

01:06.424 --> 01:07.958
And, you know, we should
consider changing

01:08.026 --> 01:09.693
Our company investments
portfolio.

01:09.761 --> 01:12.263
You started dating
again, haven't you?

01:12.330 --> 01:13.864
Stop it, cal,
right now!

01:13.932 --> 01:16.500
Yeah! All right,
stock broker?
Money manager?

01:16.568 --> 01:17.801
Banker?

01:17.869 --> 01:19.603
Oh, I thought
you wanted to
have some fun.

01:19.671 --> 01:20.971
Oh, I'm having fun,
don't you worry.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.039
Oh, really?

01:22.107 --> 01:23.908
Yes, torres?

01:23.975 --> 01:25.576
There's a visitor
in your office,

01:25.644 --> 01:27.745
Sally robinson
from london.

01:30.282 --> 01:32.249
What?

01:32.317 --> 01:33.817
Whoa. Sally who?

01:33.885 --> 01:36.587
Robinson. High school
sweetheart or something?

01:36.655 --> 01:37.988
In my office?

01:38.056 --> 01:40.057
Uh-huh.

01:44.162 --> 01:45.496
Gotcha!

01:45.564 --> 01:47.932
[laughs]

01:47.999 --> 01:49.333
God almighty.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.468
Yeah, but my mates
still call me terry.

01:51.536 --> 01:53.003
Come here.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.306
Sally robinson, eh?

01:55.373 --> 01:58.309
Hold on, is that
a canoe in your
pocket, eh, cal?

01:58.376 --> 01:59.643
Nicely played
there, mia.

01:59.711 --> 02:00.945
Ria.

02:01.012 --> 02:02.846
Oh. Well,
thank you
anyway.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.481
Excuse his manners.

02:04.549 --> 02:06.717
Terry marsh,
his ex-partner
in crime.

02:06.785 --> 02:07.952
In a manner of speaking.

02:08.019 --> 02:09.152
Gillian foster,
current partner in crime.

02:09.221 --> 02:10.654
Nice to meet you, terry.

02:10.722 --> 02:11.555
You, too.

02:11.623 --> 02:13.257
All right,
that's enough of that.

02:13.325 --> 02:15.059
Good-bye, dr. Foster.

02:15.126 --> 02:17.394
Wow, cal.
That is so charming.

02:17.462 --> 02:19.430
Well, it's been
22 years, isn't it?

02:19.497 --> 02:20.664
Listen, jill, you fancy
meeting us for a drink later?

02:20.732 --> 02:23.234
That's gillian,
actually.

02:23.301 --> 02:24.969
And she's busy.

02:25.036 --> 02:27.605
See you later.
Call me if you need me.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.541
Oy!
Yes.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.978
So what are we
drinking to?

02:34.045 --> 02:37.548
How about sally robinson,
wherever she may be.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.017
You wanker.
[chuckles]

02:43.922 --> 02:46.223
You all right there, terry?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.992
Oh, don't start that
bullocks with me, cal.

02:48.059 --> 02:49.393
What?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.195
With the eyes,
like you're reading
my fortune.

02:51.263 --> 02:54.531
No, I'm just pleased
to see you. Really.

02:54.599 --> 02:59.236
Though a touch curious
as to why now.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.804
Well, truth be told,

03:00.872 --> 03:01.972
I've thought twice
about looking you up

03:02.040 --> 03:03.474
Loads of times.

03:03.541 --> 03:04.842
Terry marsh thinking twice.

03:04.909 --> 03:06.543
Well, that's a first,
isn't it?

03:06.611 --> 03:07.978
Come on.

03:08.046 --> 03:09.613
Come on where?

03:09.681 --> 03:11.749
I'll tell you what, cal,
I'll do a deal with you.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.951
What's past is past.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.986
What's done is done.

03:16.054 --> 03:18.555
It's just all water
under the bridge.

03:18.623 --> 03:20.491
Fair?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.597
Water under the bridge, then.

03:36.207 --> 03:38.809
Oh, hello, lovely lady.

03:38.877 --> 03:40.411
I'm terry.

03:40.478 --> 03:41.945
Hi.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.314
You should say
hello to my dad.

03:43.381 --> 03:46.317
Hi, dad. I'm cara.
This is alice.

03:46.384 --> 03:47.518
Stage names?

03:47.585 --> 03:50.954
Oh, down, dad, down.
Forgive him.

03:53.158 --> 03:56.160
Ready?

03:57.762 --> 03:59.963
Whoa, feast your eyes.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.131
Hey, cal, no.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.401
Not that way.

04:04.469 --> 04:06.970
Over there, son.

04:08.473 --> 04:09.773
I don't play cards
anymore, terry.

04:09.841 --> 04:12.443
Look at me very
carefully, cal.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.545
I did not get this
jailbird for nothing.

04:14.612 --> 04:16.880
Don't make me say it.

04:16.947 --> 04:19.916
I owe you my life.
There you go. I said it.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.885
Do this for me tonight,

04:21.952 --> 04:23.487
And then
we're all square.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.090
How much do you owe?

04:26.157 --> 04:29.460
12 large.
12 grand?

04:29.527 --> 04:30.794
It'll be like
the old days.

04:30.862 --> 04:32.029
You know, I'll do
all the talking,
and you do--

04:32.097 --> 04:34.031
Yeah, science.
Yeah.

04:34.099 --> 04:35.966
Well, it's texas
hold 'em, no limit.

04:36.034 --> 04:39.503
And this is
my last 2 grand
in the world.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.008
Cheers.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.311
Ok.

04:48.713 --> 04:50.614
I think I've had
a bit too much to drink
for this, terry.

04:50.682 --> 04:53.484
Yeah, well,
that's rubbish.
But nice try.

04:54.819 --> 04:56.453
Hey, terry.

04:56.521 --> 04:58.655
You're feeling
luckier tonight?

04:58.723 --> 05:00.023
Hey, gents.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.693
An old mate of mine,
harry sloane from n.Y.C.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.862
How you doin'?

05:06.431 --> 05:07.998
Hey, foster.
Have you seen lightman?

05:08.066 --> 05:09.533
He's taking
a personal day.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.136
Yeah, he's with a man
who's on the scotland yard
watch list,

05:12.203 --> 05:13.337
Which means,
when he's over here,

05:13.405 --> 05:15.139
He's on the fbi watch list.

05:15.206 --> 05:17.574
It's part of the special
relationship with the brits.

05:17.642 --> 05:19.042
What's terry
done wrong?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.477
Nothing recently.

05:20.545 --> 05:22.446
Watch lists are
more precautionary
than anything else.

05:22.514 --> 05:25.916
Yet, your tone is
telling me it's more
than just a head's up.

05:25.984 --> 05:27.951
Then it should also
be telling you that I'm not

05:28.019 --> 05:31.455
At liberty to discuss this
any further.

05:31.523 --> 05:33.257
Gbh, grievous
bodily harm,

05:33.324 --> 05:34.658
22 years ago?

05:34.726 --> 05:36.927
They want you to
dig into lightman's
past with terry?

05:36.995 --> 05:39.129
Let's just say
it's his immediate future

05:39.197 --> 05:41.532
I'm more worried about.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.207
Thousand.

05:50.275 --> 05:52.342
I fold.

05:53.845 --> 05:56.447
Call.

06:01.953 --> 06:03.687
Down.

06:07.926 --> 06:10.093
You ok, terry?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.329
I'm good for it,
lance.

06:12.397 --> 06:13.997
You know I am.

06:14.065 --> 06:15.232
I know you are.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.000
We're all gentleman here,

06:17.068 --> 06:18.068
Someone get this man a drink.

06:18.136 --> 06:20.170
Thanks.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.209
Call.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.761
All-in.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.710
I said--
I heard you the first time.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.352
Call.

07:14.025 --> 07:16.994
Ten high.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.634
You called me
on a jack high.
That's ridiculous.

07:23.701 --> 07:25.669
Apparently not.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.039
Gentlemen,
it's been a pleasure.

07:29.107 --> 07:32.709
Listen, can we have
a little break, please?

07:32.777 --> 07:35.112
Just a minute, huh?

07:35.179 --> 07:37.881
Why not?
Order up some eggs.

07:37.949 --> 07:39.983
Cheers.

07:40.051 --> 07:41.919
[indistinct chatter]

07:54.132 --> 07:56.099
Do you mind?

08:06.844 --> 08:08.879
Harry sloane
from new york city?

08:08.947 --> 08:11.415
Are you out of
your bloody mind?

08:11.482 --> 08:14.017
I could hardly say
you're dr. Lightman,

08:14.085 --> 08:16.987
The lie expert
and the reader of faces,
now can I?

08:17.055 --> 08:20.591
I assume the 12 grand
was just a teaser to get me
in the game, is that it?

08:20.658 --> 08:23.961
How much do you owe
this psychopath?

08:24.028 --> 08:26.663
Oy! How much?

08:26.731 --> 08:28.065
95.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.933
95 grand?
Yeah.

08:30.001 --> 08:31.868
You expect me to
take that kind of
money off these men

08:31.936 --> 08:34.371
Instead of just
walking out of here
while I still can?

08:34.438 --> 08:36.440
Excuse me.
Hey, no, no, no.

08:36.506 --> 08:40.110
Cal, you know exactly
what's going to happen
to me if you walk away.

08:41.613 --> 08:43.780
[grunts]

08:45.583 --> 08:47.451
So is this a prank

08:47.518 --> 08:49.453
Or a serious
death threat?

08:50.521 --> 08:53.290
Man: Very soon now,
you'll all be sorry.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.559
It's all going
to end this week.

08:55.627 --> 08:58.595
The pain will stop.

09:00.064 --> 09:02.499
Uniforms.
Private school?

09:02.567 --> 09:04.968
Uh, college preparatory.

09:05.036 --> 09:08.372
You're the only one
this video was sent to,
mr. Anders?

09:08.439 --> 09:09.706
As far as I know.

09:09.774 --> 09:12.843
It was left on my desk
during the lunch hour

09:12.910 --> 09:15.445
In an envelope marked
"headmaster, urgent."

09:15.513 --> 09:16.947
Has anyone else
seen the tape?

09:17.015 --> 09:19.516
Just the fbi,
and now you.

09:19.584 --> 09:20.450
Have you closed
the school?

09:20.518 --> 09:22.486
School's out for
the rest of today.

09:22.553 --> 09:24.921
My first piece of advice
to you--close the school.

09:24.989 --> 09:26.923
For how long?

09:26.991 --> 09:29.326
Until we determine
who made this.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.195
So indefinitely.

09:32.263 --> 09:34.131
Dr. Foster,
do you realize

09:34.198 --> 09:36.900
What that would do to us?
That would ruin our school.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.402
So this is about money?

09:38.469 --> 09:41.638
Ahem. From handwriting analysis
on the envelopes,

09:41.706 --> 09:44.941
Student files, locker searches
and security camera tapes,

09:45.009 --> 09:48.311
Agents on site were able
to make a preliminary list

09:48.379 --> 09:49.613
Of students who might
fit the profile.

09:49.681 --> 09:51.381
25 names?

09:51.449 --> 09:53.850
Fit the profile
for what?

09:53.918 --> 09:55.719
Homicidal intent.

09:55.787 --> 09:57.120
Oh, god.

09:57.188 --> 09:59.890
First of all,
hands up, who's heard
of the lightman group?

09:59.957 --> 10:02.325
All right, well,
we are scientists

10:02.393 --> 10:03.860
Who interpret
human emotions.

10:03.928 --> 10:04.928
And this morning,
with your help,

10:04.996 --> 10:06.496
I'm going to run
an experiment

10:06.564 --> 10:08.131
Which should be quite
informative.

10:08.199 --> 10:10.200
So rather than listen
to me drone on all day,

10:10.268 --> 10:12.169
Let's just get started,
shall we?

10:20.078 --> 10:23.180
Man: Very soon now,
you'll all be sorry.

10:23.247 --> 10:26.116
It's all going
to end this week.

10:26.184 --> 10:27.884
The pain will stop.

10:34.292 --> 10:36.226
[screaming]

10:43.968 --> 10:45.469
No one's that good.

10:45.536 --> 10:46.670
You two are working
together.

10:46.738 --> 10:48.138
Who is he, terry?

10:48.206 --> 10:49.706
You cheating me?

10:49.774 --> 10:53.744
'cause I will put
a bullet in your head.

10:53.811 --> 10:55.045
There's 105 grand there.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.981
You and terry
are even now.

10:58.049 --> 11:01.685
You keep the change.
We're all gentlemen here.

11:01.753 --> 11:05.222
At least for now,
with all those witnesses
in the next room.

11:08.359 --> 11:10.794
I said he keeps
the change.

11:23.775 --> 11:26.710
Mate, say something.

11:26.778 --> 11:29.813
You're welcome.
Don't mention it.

11:29.881 --> 11:31.348
I love you, cal.

11:31.415 --> 11:32.949
Don't forget that.

11:33.017 --> 11:35.452
Yeah, I'll see you
in another 22 years.

11:45.596 --> 11:47.697
Rough night, huh?

11:47.765 --> 11:49.199
Yep.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.101
No rest for the wicked.
Yeah.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.203
Something tells me
you already know that.

11:53.271 --> 11:55.272
You want to know
what else I know?

11:55.339 --> 11:57.207
You know your buddy,
terry moss,

11:57.275 --> 11:59.109
He spent 3 years
in bellmarsh prison
in England.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.945
'87 to '90
for assault and battery.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.113
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.982
And he's gone now,
and I'm tired,

12:06.050 --> 12:07.684
And I'm hungover,

12:07.752 --> 12:09.152
And it's none
of your business.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.987
You made it my business
when you spent the night

12:11.055 --> 12:12.889
At the penthouse suite
at the park hotel

12:12.957 --> 12:15.125
Where there were prostitutes
and illegal gambling.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.394
Those women
were prostitutes?

12:17.461 --> 12:18.662
[sighs]

12:18.729 --> 12:21.031
How'd you know?

12:21.098 --> 12:23.433
Did you follow us?

12:23.501 --> 12:25.769
That's interesting.

12:29.073 --> 12:30.440
There.

12:30.508 --> 12:31.808
Surprise and shame
in less than a second,

12:31.876 --> 12:32.943
And then nothing.

12:33.010 --> 12:35.712
Pulling down the mask.
Put her on the list.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.547
Hey.
Hey.

12:37.615 --> 12:39.616
Oh, go back a few seconds.

12:39.684 --> 12:41.518
[rewinding]
there you go.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.153
All right,
see this girl?

12:43.221 --> 12:44.955
Same girl,
she glances
at the teacher.

12:45.022 --> 12:46.823
There you go, see?
And he catches her at it.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.492
Yeah? He's got his eye
on her for some reason.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.761
So does this girl
here. Look.

12:51.829 --> 12:56.433
And then she looks over
at that guy.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.902
Nice one, loker.

12:58.970 --> 13:02.439
Soon you'll be
asking me for a raise,

13:02.506 --> 13:04.241
Which I've been assured
that we can't afford,

13:04.308 --> 13:05.876
So stand down.

13:05.943 --> 13:08.812
Right, well,
keep watching
the tape, then.

13:09.814 --> 13:10.847
I'll be back
in a minute.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.882
You look awful.

13:11.949 --> 13:14.451
And yet,
I feel so much worse.

13:24.996 --> 13:28.298
I said 22 years,
not 22 minutes.

13:28.366 --> 13:30.634
We're in a lot
of trouble, cal.

13:30.701 --> 13:32.869
They know who you
are and what you do,

13:32.937 --> 13:35.071
And they ain't happy.

13:35.139 --> 13:36.773
What do they want?

13:36.841 --> 13:38.275
Oh, you know,
they want to see you

13:38.342 --> 13:39.743
Saw a girl in half.
What do you think
they want?

13:39.810 --> 13:42.212
They want you to be
their magic man.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.447
And they're waiting
for you around
the corner in a van.

13:44.515 --> 13:45.882
And if you don't
come now, then...

13:45.950 --> 13:48.852
Then I'm done.

13:50.087 --> 13:53.023
As in dead, done.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.179
Yeah, I'll see what
I can find out from him.

13:59.247 --> 14:00.614
Hey.
Hey.

14:00.682 --> 14:02.950
Your buddy's lost
his fbi tail.

14:03.017 --> 14:05.218
Now do you have any clue
on where he could be right now?

14:05.286 --> 14:07.387
Yeah. Come with me,
will you?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.459
He's in my office.

14:12.527 --> 14:14.394
He's in your office?
Yep.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.196
What the hell is
he doing in there?

14:16.264 --> 14:18.098
I've got a major
bloody problem here.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.566
Oh, you're damn
right, you do.

14:19.634 --> 14:21.702
You do understand
that terry's involved

14:21.769 --> 14:23.503
With an extremely
dangerous criminal,
right?

14:23.571 --> 14:25.105
Yeah. Lance mcclellan.
Lance mcclellan.

14:25.173 --> 14:26.039
Exactly.

14:26.107 --> 14:27.407
He's a new-school
crime boss.

14:27.475 --> 14:28.508
Educated,
well-connected,

14:28.576 --> 14:30.644
Hidden in plain sight.
This ends now.

14:30.712 --> 14:33.380
Look, terry's family to me.
There's no way I'm going
to let him hang himself.

14:33.448 --> 14:34.615
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to let him
hang you, either.

14:34.682 --> 14:37.250
Wait, wait, wait.
What's mcclellan's game?

14:37.318 --> 14:38.819
It depends.

14:38.886 --> 14:40.554
Which means
you don't know, right?

14:40.622 --> 14:42.656
That means
that you're gonna help me

14:42.724 --> 14:44.458
Help terry to help you.

14:44.525 --> 14:46.259
[scoffs] if anyone's
helping anyone here,

14:46.327 --> 14:48.261
It's gonna be you
helping to bring down

14:48.329 --> 14:49.363
Mcclellan and terry.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.564
And I know
he's your friend,

14:50.632 --> 14:52.499
But those guys are
bad sons of bitches.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.101
Look, mcclellan
sent terry for me,

14:54.168 --> 14:55.535
Which means he needs
something from me, right?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.371
Whatever it is,
he needs it quick.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.339
If you're suggesting
what I think you're
suggesting,

14:59.407 --> 15:00.707
You can forget it, ok?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.209
You're not a trained
undercover agent.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.510
Knock it off, ben,
you know I'm doing this.

15:03.578 --> 15:04.511
Not if I arrest you,
you're not.

15:04.579 --> 15:06.513
You're going to arrest me?!
Yeah.

15:06.581 --> 15:08.181
I won over a hundred grand
in cards last night.

15:08.249 --> 15:10.651
I know a bluff when I see one.
You're not arresting me.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.953
[sighs]

15:13.021 --> 15:14.254
And you keep
foster out of this,
all right?

15:14.322 --> 15:17.357
Her focus needs to be 100%
on that school.

15:17.425 --> 15:19.493
And I'm banking
on you to have
my back for this.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.261
Oh, you mean like
a real fbi agent?

15:21.329 --> 15:22.663
Something
like that, yeah.

15:22.730 --> 15:23.864
Hey.
Hey.

15:23.931 --> 15:25.298
So we're needed
in the conference room.

15:25.366 --> 15:26.900
Torres is in there
with three kids
from the school.

15:26.968 --> 15:27.901
All right.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.002
What's wrong?

15:29.070 --> 15:30.504
Nothing.

15:30.571 --> 15:32.139
Nothing.

15:32.206 --> 15:35.175
Look, reynolds was
just telling me what
a bad seed terry was.

15:35.243 --> 15:36.810
You know, and it came as
a bit of a shock, you know.

15:36.878 --> 15:38.979
'cause there was I thinking
that he was a choir boy.

15:43.451 --> 15:45.852
All right.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.220
Stand up.

15:47.288 --> 15:48.822
Stand up, stand up.

15:48.890 --> 15:51.291
All right, when did
you make the video?

15:51.359 --> 15:52.459
What?!
What's your name again?

15:52.527 --> 15:54.661
I didn't make it.
Exploding buildings,

15:54.729 --> 15:56.029
That was news footage,
right?

15:56.097 --> 15:57.597
Your name is...?
Stacey.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.765
Stacey.
I don't know.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.667
Probably.
I couldn't...

16:00.735 --> 16:02.703
I'm the one who made
that video.

16:02.770 --> 16:04.705
Jared?

16:04.772 --> 16:06.373
Jared rollins
is my name.

16:06.441 --> 16:08.709
I made the video.

16:08.776 --> 16:10.544
Get your hands
out of your pockets.

16:10.611 --> 16:13.046
So what's the plan, eh?

16:13.114 --> 16:16.550
Is it a bombing
or a shooting or what?

16:16.617 --> 16:19.886
'cause you know, there
always is a plan, right?

16:19.954 --> 16:22.489
You tell me.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.429
So when did you make
the video, jared?

16:29.497 --> 16:31.164
What does it matter?

16:31.232 --> 16:33.633
Well, I thought
it would have mattered
a great deal to you.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.570
I made the video,
that's all you need to know.

16:36.637 --> 16:37.704
Well, who did you
send it to?

16:37.772 --> 16:39.239
What?

16:39.307 --> 16:42.976
And stop right there.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.811
He's lying,
he didn't make it.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.080
Jared, why would you lie
about making that video?

16:47.148 --> 16:49.015
'cause maybe they all
deserve to die,

16:49.083 --> 16:50.984
Or at least worry about it.

16:51.052 --> 16:51.985
Who?

16:52.053 --> 16:54.221
They know who they are.

16:54.288 --> 16:56.389
If he didn't make the video,
he sure wishes he had.

16:56.457 --> 16:57.524
His face, body language.

16:57.592 --> 17:01.161
It's homicidal intent,
right?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.534
Your name is?
Stacey.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.236
Stacey. That was
news footage?

17:09.303 --> 17:10.904
I don't know.
Probably.

17:10.972 --> 17:12.672
I'm the one
who made the video.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.307
Jared?

17:14.375 --> 17:16.877
Jared rollins
is my name.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.880
Ok, when he said
he made the video,

17:19.946 --> 17:22.214
He deliberately
interrupted stacey.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.384
And she's relieved.

17:24.452 --> 17:28.054
He's covering for her,
he's protecting her.

17:29.891 --> 17:32.058
[door opens]

17:35.163 --> 17:37.731
Oh, nice shirt.
Help yourself.

17:37.799 --> 17:39.432
I thought
you'd fallen in.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.534
Right now, that would be
a quality problem.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.068
How's your hand?

17:42.136 --> 17:44.538
Ah, it's all right.
[groaning]

17:44.605 --> 17:46.306
You know, I don't
normally approve
of torture,

17:46.374 --> 17:48.608
But in your case,
that is personal.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.110
What's going on,
terry?

17:50.178 --> 17:52.045
Eh? What's going on?

17:52.113 --> 17:53.513
God!

17:53.581 --> 17:55.081
You all right?
You're all right.

17:55.149 --> 17:56.349
[groaning]

17:56.417 --> 17:58.051
You remember those, uh,

17:58.119 --> 18:00.720
The property flips
we used to do
back in london?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.222
Yeah.
I only broke in

18:02.290 --> 18:05.492
And sold the wrong man's
miami mansion.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.561
But it turns out,

18:07.628 --> 18:10.030
He was connected.
[chuckles]

18:11.432 --> 18:12.833
[groaning]

18:12.900 --> 18:14.100
Answer the question.
All right?

18:14.168 --> 18:15.535
All right? What are you
dragging me into?

18:15.603 --> 18:17.804
Nothing!
Hey?

18:17.872 --> 18:19.706
I don't know.
I swear to god, cal,

18:19.774 --> 18:21.174
I do not know.

18:21.242 --> 18:24.211
[groaning]

18:25.680 --> 18:28.281
Well, come on, then.

18:29.183 --> 18:31.084
Thank you.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.587
Oh, shut up.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.121
So the video...

18:35.189 --> 18:38.158
Even though you didn't
make it, does speak
to your needs?

18:38.226 --> 18:41.461
And which is partly why
you took false credit.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.897
And you say
they deserve to die,

18:43.965 --> 18:47.734
But you're clearly
scared to name them.

18:47.802 --> 18:50.470
Loker, take jared back
to the conference room.

18:50.538 --> 18:53.240
I need to talk
to stacey now.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.176
We're done.

18:56.244 --> 18:58.411
[door opens]

19:02.116 --> 19:03.783
Where's lightman?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.185
He's not in his office.
We keep calling him,

19:05.253 --> 19:07.254
But it's going straight
to voicemail.

19:07.321 --> 19:08.822
Where could he be?
I mean, that's not
like him.

19:08.890 --> 19:11.057
Could you keep
trying?
Yeah.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.293
[sighs]

19:26.841 --> 19:28.575
Dr. Lightman.

19:28.643 --> 19:31.478
Good of you to come.

19:34.448 --> 19:36.216
I warn you,
I'm not cheap.

19:36.284 --> 19:38.852
Well, terry's
life cover it?

19:38.920 --> 19:40.053
Barely.

19:40.121 --> 19:41.955
We have a deal, then.

19:43.824 --> 19:46.226
I like to think of all
of my people as family,

19:46.294 --> 19:50.664
But one of these three
has been informing
on me to the government.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.500
Now, you're going to
tell me for certain

19:53.567 --> 19:55.235
Which one is the rat.

19:56.771 --> 19:58.004
What, so you can
kill the man?

19:58.072 --> 20:00.240
Three minutes,
dr. Lightman.

20:03.144 --> 20:06.046
Right, then.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.254
All right, boys?

20:20.126 --> 20:22.294
Well, you're right.

20:24.831 --> 20:27.900
There is a liar
in the room.

20:29.035 --> 20:31.036
Liar's you.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.072
[groaning]
what are you doing?!

20:33.139 --> 20:36.342
Now's not the time
to play the comedian,
all right?!

20:36.409 --> 20:38.744
Get up.

20:38.812 --> 20:40.613
Just give him
one more chance.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.448
He won't let you down,
will you?

20:43.650 --> 20:46.719
None of these men
is an informer.

20:46.786 --> 20:49.755
But you already
knew that, didn't you?

20:49.823 --> 20:50.990
Eh?

20:51.057 --> 20:52.257
Good.

20:52.325 --> 20:53.959
[dialing]

20:54.027 --> 20:56.128
Yeah. Told you
he was the best,
didn't I?

20:56.196 --> 20:58.330
Yeah, what I want
to know is when
you told him that,

20:58.398 --> 21:00.933
Terry.
Was it last night?

21:01.001 --> 21:02.568
Last week, last month?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.169
Quiet, ladies.

21:05.338 --> 21:08.307
Nice one, terry.

21:10.410 --> 21:15.014
Stacey, are you
and jasmine friends?

21:16.349 --> 21:18.651
The exact same look
she showed for jasmine
in class.

21:18.718 --> 21:20.219
Contempt.

21:20.286 --> 21:21.920
She's mean to me.

21:21.988 --> 21:23.756
In p.E.,

21:23.823 --> 21:26.325
In the locker room.

21:26.393 --> 21:28.427
But she's not
the only one.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.596
I hate p.E.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.464
Well, did you tell
your teacher?

21:32.532 --> 21:34.466
He knows.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.737
Stacey, I wish I didn't
have to ask you this...

21:38.805 --> 21:41.807
But do you
ever wish jasmine

21:41.875 --> 21:44.410
Or any of the other
kids who are mean
to you, harm?

21:44.477 --> 21:46.478
Harm?

21:46.546 --> 21:48.080
Like...

21:48.148 --> 21:51.483
You think I made that video,

21:51.551 --> 21:54.186
That it was...

21:54.254 --> 21:55.788
I may have thought
about revenge,

21:55.855 --> 22:00.159
But I don't want them to die.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.729
She's telling the truth.
She doesn't want to harm anyone.

22:03.797 --> 22:07.800
Please don't tell jasmine
I told on her.

22:07.867 --> 22:10.602
Oh, sweetie.

22:10.670 --> 22:12.771
Maybe she is the one
who made the video.

22:12.839 --> 22:15.507
All this is
is her fantasy
of revenge.

22:15.575 --> 22:17.176
Who's the p.E.
Teacher?

22:17.243 --> 22:19.778
Why?
It's not you, is it?

22:19.846 --> 22:22.181
Yeah, but I would
never turn a blind eye
to bullying if I saw it.

22:22.248 --> 22:24.783
Did you know that these kids
were picking on stacey?

22:24.851 --> 22:28.220
Well, I could see
she wasn't the most popular.

22:28.288 --> 22:29.288
Is jasmine popular?

22:29.355 --> 22:31.056
Yeah. I'd say so.

22:31.124 --> 22:33.358
Very, actually.

22:33.426 --> 22:35.661
It's always the popular
ones who think they can
get away with murder.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.862
Spoken like
a true scientist.

22:36.930 --> 22:39.164
Trust me, I just know.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.836
We should get jasmine
in there now.

22:44.904 --> 22:48.474
So you two
go back a ways?

22:48.541 --> 22:51.009
Well, I'm sure
terry's told you
all about it.

22:51.077 --> 22:52.244
Property scams.

22:52.312 --> 22:54.847
You picked out
the easy marks.

22:54.914 --> 22:57.316
Terry took them for
everything they had.

22:57.383 --> 23:00.018
Yeah. If that's how
terry remembers it.

23:00.086 --> 23:01.386
I remember you
with the business

23:01.454 --> 23:02.688
Of picking out
just the right mark.

23:02.756 --> 23:06.725
The absolute bloody
business, I swear.

23:06.793 --> 23:10.562
Hmm. Terry tells me
that you owe him
your life, dr. Lightman.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.164
Tell me about that.

23:12.232 --> 23:15.834
I--I thought
it was water
under the bridge.

23:15.902 --> 23:17.970
Even so,

23:18.037 --> 23:19.938
While we're waiting.

23:20.006 --> 23:23.041
What if I was
to say we were
west ham supporters

23:23.109 --> 23:25.377
At millwall game?

23:25.445 --> 23:27.880
He saved you
from soccer hooligans.

23:27.947 --> 23:29.081
Manner of speaking.

23:29.149 --> 23:31.183
Or were you two
the hooligans?

23:31.251 --> 23:34.353
Not guilty,
your honor.
[chuckles]

23:36.122 --> 23:39.057
You see that look,
terry?

23:40.527 --> 23:44.029
That look says that
your time on this planet
is running out.

23:44.097 --> 23:46.565
Yeah, put a cork in it,
cal, all right? That's enough.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.767
See, it's always the same,
the criminal mind.

23:48.835 --> 23:50.736
Never sees the end
of the road.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.871
Forever hoping,
often actually believing

23:52.939 --> 23:55.007
That there will be just
one more corner to turn.

23:55.074 --> 23:57.843
[cell phone rings]
not his fault.

23:57.911 --> 23:58.977
He's not the only one.

23:59.045 --> 24:00.946
I'm basically wired
the same way.

24:01.014 --> 24:02.714
All right.

24:02.782 --> 24:05.017
They're on their way.
Five minutes out.

24:05.084 --> 24:06.718
Who?

24:06.786 --> 24:07.920
The man that you're
going to meet with.

24:07.987 --> 24:09.454
See if he's on
the level or not

24:09.522 --> 24:10.823
Before I do business
with him.

24:10.890 --> 24:13.091
Call him back.
Cancel it.

24:13.159 --> 24:14.626
Excuse me?
What?

24:14.694 --> 24:16.795
Look out the window.

24:19.966 --> 24:21.233
Right, there's an fbi
tail out there.

24:21.301 --> 24:22.801
They've been on terry
like a cheap suit

24:22.869 --> 24:24.136
Since he landed.

24:28.374 --> 24:31.543
Don't play games,
professor.

24:31.611 --> 24:33.812
You can thank me later.

24:36.716 --> 24:38.317
Show me.

24:40.286 --> 24:42.120
See it?

24:42.188 --> 24:44.590
The blue one?
No, no.

24:44.657 --> 24:45.624
Not the blue one,
the other one.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.825
That one over from it,
the red one.

24:46.893 --> 24:48.727
The red station wagon.

24:50.063 --> 24:52.598
Might as well have
had the blue light
flashing on top.

24:53.967 --> 24:56.468
Call him back.
Change the meet
to the warehouse.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.137
Get up.

24:59.205 --> 25:00.205
A whole lot of
people think that

25:00.273 --> 25:01.673
It's just
the victims
of bullies

25:01.741 --> 25:03.842
Who get hurt.

25:03.910 --> 25:05.777
But the bullies

25:05.845 --> 25:07.779
Pay a price, too.

25:07.847 --> 25:10.616
You know, maybe not
physically, but--

25:10.683 --> 25:12.417
We were just
joking around at first.

25:12.485 --> 25:14.786
Yeah, about what?
Stacey's weight?

25:14.854 --> 25:17.222
That, and...

25:17.290 --> 25:20.659
I can't explain.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.128
It got out of control.

25:23.196 --> 25:26.531
I'm so sorry.

25:26.599 --> 25:28.433
Are you, though?

25:28.501 --> 25:30.936
It wasn't just me.

25:31.004 --> 25:33.505
There are others.

25:33.573 --> 25:37.209
If that video means
what I think it means,

25:37.277 --> 25:40.679
That it's all coming
to an end--

25:40.747 --> 25:42.714
The pain, her pain, mine?

25:42.782 --> 25:45.284
I wish it would.

25:45.351 --> 25:48.120
I hate myself
for what I did to stacey.

25:48.187 --> 25:51.757
But I couldn't stop.
He didn't want us to.

25:51.824 --> 25:53.458
He meaning you.

25:53.526 --> 25:54.660
Hmm?

25:54.727 --> 25:55.661
And you still mean
to tell me

25:55.728 --> 25:57.029
You had no idea
this was going on?

25:57.096 --> 25:58.764
I can't be everywhere
all the time.

25:58.831 --> 26:00.899
Ducks the question
while grabbing
for an excuse.

26:00.967 --> 26:02.501
Yeah, classic
deflection.

26:02.568 --> 26:06.705
If stacey made that video,
it's because of me.

26:10.176 --> 26:11.411
Where's stacey?

26:11.778 --> 26:13.479
She went
to the bathroom.
How long ago?

26:13.547 --> 26:14.480
A few minutes.

26:14.548 --> 26:16.148
More like 10, I think.

26:16.216 --> 26:17.950
Stacey?

26:18.018 --> 26:21.087
Stacey!

26:21.154 --> 26:23.022
Stacey, come on.

26:23.090 --> 26:25.024
Open up now, please.

26:30.864 --> 26:32.031
Stacey!

26:32.099 --> 26:33.466
I can't find a pulse.

26:33.533 --> 26:34.467
Oh, my god.

26:34.534 --> 26:35.701
Oh, my god,
I missed it.

26:35.769 --> 26:37.003
It wasn't
homicidal intent.

26:37.070 --> 26:39.205
I misread the sadness.

26:39.273 --> 26:40.640
It was suicidal intent.
Oh, my god.

26:40.707 --> 26:42.608
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.609
Move it, move it.

26:56.610 --> 26:57.910
Alright, let's go, let's leave.

26:58.611 --> 26:59.611
***

27:19.556 --> 27:20.257
The parents have been
contacted, right?

27:20.325 --> 27:22.192
It's been taken care of.

27:25.730 --> 27:27.764
Tell me she's going
to be ok.

27:30.468 --> 27:33.804
She's going to be ok.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.601
Stay here.

28:04.669 --> 28:07.070
Talk amongst yourselves.

28:09.674 --> 28:11.875
[door locks]

28:14.579 --> 28:16.880
Was that really
an fbi tail?

28:16.948 --> 28:18.148
Yep.

28:18.216 --> 28:19.316
And you just ditched them?
Yes.

28:19.384 --> 28:21.018
To earn
his trust, yeah.

28:21.085 --> 28:22.619
Oh, well, that worked
like a charm, cal.

28:22.687 --> 28:24.721
We got blindfolds
and locked doors.

28:24.789 --> 28:27.991
Are we even yet,
terry?

28:28.059 --> 28:30.961
Are we ever
going to be even
in your eyes?

28:31.029 --> 28:31.962
Oh, you think
that's what
this is about?

28:32.030 --> 28:34.298
It's about
who's even with who.

28:34.365 --> 28:35.532
That's a bit rich
coming from you, mate.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.700
Ok, mate,

28:36.768 --> 28:38.769
I did three years in prison
saving your ass.

28:38.836 --> 28:40.070
So what do I gotta do?

28:40.138 --> 28:41.471
I gotta die to save
yours, have I?

28:41.539 --> 28:43.373
You should have come to
me in the first place.

28:43.441 --> 28:45.108
You should have been
honest with me.
You should have said,

28:45.176 --> 28:46.543
"cal, I'm in a bit
of bother.

28:46.611 --> 28:49.046
Could use some help
from a friend I know
I can count on."

28:49.113 --> 28:50.080
And you would have done what?

28:50.148 --> 28:51.048
I don't know, I would
have done something!

28:51.115 --> 28:52.549
Anything's
better than this!

28:52.617 --> 28:54.951
I haven't heard from you
in over 20 years, mate.

28:55.019 --> 28:56.753
Over 20 years.

28:58.156 --> 29:00.257
What was that?

29:01.759 --> 29:03.727
Let's just face it, eh?

29:03.795 --> 29:06.763
You wanted the past dead
and me along with it.

29:07.865 --> 29:09.599
[chuckles]

29:09.667 --> 29:12.436
Apology accepted,
by the way.

29:32.357 --> 29:34.725
Where the hell
is lightman?

29:34.792 --> 29:36.960
[indistinct chatter]

29:38.629 --> 29:41.732
My financial advisor,
harry sloane.

29:41.799 --> 29:43.834
How do you do?

29:43.901 --> 29:46.970
I see you two
already know each other.

29:47.038 --> 29:49.606
Well, any friend of terry's
is a friend of mine.

29:49.674 --> 29:52.542
So, pleasantries
out of the way.

29:52.610 --> 29:54.678
Let's get down
to the heart of
the matter, shall we?

29:54.746 --> 29:56.346
The merchandise,
mr. Jones?

29:56.414 --> 29:57.681
You say it is
the best ever,

29:57.749 --> 29:59.416
Flawless, in fact.

29:59.484 --> 30:01.284
I gave you my word,
man to man.

30:01.352 --> 30:03.086
See, now,
that's why I'm here.

30:03.154 --> 30:05.555
Yes or no questions,
they only go so far.

30:05.623 --> 30:08.959
So how flawless

30:09.026 --> 30:10.560
Is the merchandise?

30:10.628 --> 30:13.864
Currency is perfect.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.933
There's a flicker
of doubt there,

30:17.001 --> 30:19.369
But that just be
about the deal in general.

30:19.437 --> 30:21.805
I mean, perfect
counterfeit currency.

30:21.873 --> 30:24.374
That's an oxymoron
if ever I heard one, huh?

30:24.442 --> 30:26.009
What is this sideshow?

30:26.077 --> 30:27.577
He's telling
the truth, though,

30:27.645 --> 30:28.945
When he says that
the counterfeit's perfect.

30:29.013 --> 30:31.648
He truly,
he does believe that.

30:31.716 --> 30:34.451
But then again,
he's just, um,

30:34.519 --> 30:38.422
He's what his name
down at the u.N.,
all over again, right?

30:38.489 --> 30:40.690
Uh, excuse me?

30:40.758 --> 30:43.593
That guy, he truly
did believe

30:43.661 --> 30:46.396
All that wmd nonsense.

30:46.464 --> 30:48.598
So, cleverly,

30:48.666 --> 30:51.768
They sent him off
down to the u.N.
To sell it.

30:51.836 --> 30:53.503
The rest is history.

30:53.571 --> 30:55.572
No one sent me here.

30:56.674 --> 30:59.109
The currency...

30:59.177 --> 31:02.078
Is flawless.

31:02.146 --> 31:04.080
Nah, I...

31:04.148 --> 31:06.650
I mean, I'm sorry.

31:06.717 --> 31:09.286
But it's not good enough.

31:09.353 --> 31:11.555
Who is this ass? Huh?

31:11.622 --> 31:13.690
Screw him,
let's go.

31:13.758 --> 31:16.359
But we're not done yet.

31:19.464 --> 31:21.498
No, you swore to me
that you would--

31:21.566 --> 31:22.599
Hey, hey!

31:22.667 --> 31:24.734
Is he telling the truth,
dr. Lightman?

31:24.802 --> 31:26.169
Yes or no?

31:26.237 --> 31:28.905
Yes! He believes
that he is, yes.

31:28.973 --> 31:30.140
Good.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.776
So do we have
a deal or not, huh?

31:35.413 --> 31:37.981
Is this the best
you've got,
dr. Lightman?

31:38.049 --> 31:39.649
Because so far,
I'm under whelmed.

31:39.717 --> 31:41.952
Or is there more?

31:42.019 --> 31:44.721
Right, well you put me
in front of the actual
counterfeit

31:44.789 --> 31:47.457
With the bank notes
in his hands,

31:47.525 --> 31:50.694
And I'll know just how good
his product is.

31:56.644 --> 31:58.311
Just you.

31:58.379 --> 32:00.347
Terry can stay here.

32:00.414 --> 32:02.048
No.

32:02.116 --> 32:03.250
Terry's with me.

32:03.317 --> 32:05.352
It's not negotiable.

32:05.419 --> 32:08.455
No, I'll be all right, cal.
Don't be dumb.

32:08.523 --> 32:09.756
You need to be thinking
about yourself right now.

32:09.824 --> 32:11.057
Yeah, now you tell me.

32:11.125 --> 32:13.360
It's not negotiable.

32:20.868 --> 32:23.503
Ow! Come on!

32:23.571 --> 32:25.539
[groans]

32:25.606 --> 32:28.808
Say nothing, terry,
not a word.

32:31.479 --> 32:33.246
This is him?

32:33.314 --> 32:35.582
That's your counterfeiter,
right?

32:35.650 --> 32:37.217
The best there is.

32:37.285 --> 32:40.153
50,000 euros,
right there.

32:43.424 --> 32:45.959
Bloody hell!

32:46.994 --> 32:48.863
How many containers
you got?

32:48.931 --> 32:50.865
That is not your concern.
Put it back.

32:53.669 --> 32:56.170
All right, um...
What's your name?

32:56.938 --> 32:58.705
He doesn't need
to know that.

32:58.773 --> 33:00.274
I gotta establish
a baseline here.

33:00.341 --> 33:02.075
Easy answers
to easy questions.

33:02.143 --> 33:03.577
Then I can get
to bigger questions.

33:03.645 --> 33:05.545
Otto.

33:06.481 --> 33:08.015
Hammil.

33:08.082 --> 33:09.616
Otto...

33:09.684 --> 33:12.753
What's your real last name?

33:12.820 --> 33:15.322
Frankel.
Yeah.

33:16.357 --> 33:18.325
How many kids you got?
None.

33:18.393 --> 33:19.793
How long have you been married?
I'm not married.

33:19.861 --> 33:21.528
Where are you from?
Chicago.

33:21.596 --> 33:24.731
Hey, get on
with it, please,
will you?

33:24.799 --> 33:27.301
Um, these notes
are counterfeit, right?

33:27.368 --> 33:29.569
Yes.

33:29.637 --> 33:31.238
How good are they?

33:31.306 --> 33:35.142
We already tested
a modest amount
without detection.

33:35.209 --> 33:37.778
Well, dr. Lightman.

33:37.845 --> 33:39.913
What?

33:39.981 --> 33:41.481
Well, he hasn't answered
my question yet.

33:41.549 --> 33:42.949
[door opens]

33:43.017 --> 33:45.419
Easy, fellas.

33:45.486 --> 33:47.788
It's taken care of.

33:47.855 --> 33:49.289
He was right.

33:49.357 --> 33:51.158
Fbi.

33:55.330 --> 33:56.930
I don't think
I can do this.

33:56.998 --> 33:58.765
I'll be right here
the whole time.

33:58.833 --> 34:00.867
Don't worry.

34:01.803 --> 34:03.837
Just take your time,
stacey.

34:03.905 --> 34:05.872
[police radio chatter]

34:06.974 --> 34:08.909
[stacey inhales]

34:08.976 --> 34:10.710
[exhales]

34:10.777 --> 34:12.746
You knew what
they were doing to me,

34:12.813 --> 34:14.880
Mr. Fitzgerald.

34:14.949 --> 34:17.284
You didn't just ignore it.

34:17.351 --> 34:20.020
You started it all.
Oh, stacey...

34:20.088 --> 34:24.757
You kept telling me
I was fat and lazy

34:24.826 --> 34:26.626
In front of them.

34:26.694 --> 34:28.261
That's not true.

34:28.329 --> 34:29.396
Your hands and eyes
say otherwise.

34:29.464 --> 34:31.764
So do I.

34:31.833 --> 34:35.335
I'm so sorry, stacey.

34:35.402 --> 34:37.838
You know, I had a coach
like you once

34:37.905 --> 34:40.072
Who had it in for one
of the kids on the team.

34:40.141 --> 34:43.243
Constant verbal abuse

34:43.311 --> 34:46.045
Disguised as authority.

34:46.114 --> 34:48.348
Eddie, eddie johnston.

34:48.416 --> 34:49.483
And nothing
that eddie ever did

34:49.550 --> 34:51.083
Was ever good enough.

34:51.152 --> 34:52.485
You're out of line.

34:52.553 --> 34:54.221
And the example
that that coach

34:54.288 --> 34:56.623
Set for the rest of us,
just like you did for jasmine

34:56.690 --> 34:57.824
And all of her buddies,

34:57.892 --> 35:00.527
We thought it gave us
the license

35:00.595 --> 35:02.796
To make eddie an outcast.

35:02.864 --> 35:05.031
I never touched
a hair on her head.

35:05.099 --> 35:06.633
Right.

35:06.701 --> 35:09.302
Because we did it for you.

35:10.772 --> 35:14.741
I wanted you to have
to live the rest
of your life

35:14.809 --> 35:17.544
Knowing that
what you did to me

35:17.612 --> 35:19.646
Made me...

35:25.153 --> 35:28.255
You knew what
this was really about
all the time.

35:28.322 --> 35:30.624
I know,

35:30.691 --> 35:33.593
Because I sent you
a video, too.

35:33.661 --> 35:36.963
Which you neglected to
mention, mr. Fitzgerald.

35:37.031 --> 35:39.266
Making you guilty
of obstruction of justice.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.468
And if this keeps you
away from kids forever,

35:41.536 --> 35:43.570
I'll take it.

35:43.638 --> 35:45.872
Right, stacey?

35:46.774 --> 35:47.974
Yeah.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.142
[scoffs] wait a minute.

35:49.210 --> 35:52.679
One kid has a psychological
breakdown, an illness,

35:52.747 --> 35:55.048
And I'm to blame?

35:58.553 --> 35:59.786
[scoffs]

35:59.854 --> 36:01.955
We need to talk--
I don't think so.

36:05.193 --> 36:07.727
Thank you.

36:09.897 --> 36:11.798
There's a whitening
of the skin around
the eyes,

36:11.866 --> 36:13.166
Which is a dead give away

36:13.234 --> 36:15.836
For the kind of fear
that we try to hide
when we lie.

36:15.903 --> 36:18.638
And a slight rotation
of the right arm,

36:18.706 --> 36:21.041
Which is what we call in
the trade a shrug fragment,

36:21.108 --> 36:24.377
Which means he's got
zero confidence
in what he just said.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.381
The eyes of a cheat

36:28.449 --> 36:30.383
Who thinks he has
all the cards,

36:30.451 --> 36:31.985
But who knows

36:32.053 --> 36:34.921
I'm telling the truth.

36:42.630 --> 36:45.332
Well, he's lying.

36:45.399 --> 36:47.634
The son of a bitch
has been playing us
the whole time.

36:47.702 --> 36:49.469
Whoa, easy!
No, I didn't say--

36:49.537 --> 36:51.037
You really think
we're that dumb, huh?

36:51.105 --> 36:53.540
Easy! I didn't say!
I didn't--!

36:53.608 --> 36:55.842
No! No!
Fbi! Nobody move!

36:57.879 --> 37:00.914
Anybody else?

37:00.982 --> 37:02.983
Down on your knees!

37:03.050 --> 37:04.684
Now!

37:21.297 --> 37:23.164
How do you do that?

37:25.067 --> 37:27.302
Blanks.

37:27.369 --> 37:28.536
Blanks?

37:28.604 --> 37:29.171
No, no, I mean,
with your eyes.

37:29.239 --> 37:30.472
How do you do that?

37:30.540 --> 37:32.241
Oh, it's just practice.

37:32.309 --> 37:34.209
What's going on?

37:34.277 --> 37:36.578
[all groaning]

37:36.646 --> 37:38.314
Put your hands
behind your back.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.950
I swear, I'm getting
too old for this, terry.

37:41.017 --> 37:42.184
I really am.

37:42.252 --> 37:43.819
Fbi have been onto
you and mcclellan

37:43.887 --> 37:46.855
For, oh, a while now.

37:46.923 --> 37:47.957
Special agent hutton.

37:48.024 --> 37:49.091
Oh, nice to meet you.

37:49.159 --> 37:51.293
You, too.

37:51.361 --> 37:53.095
Superior work,
agent reynolds.

37:53.163 --> 37:54.129
Well, likewise, my friend.

37:54.197 --> 37:55.698
So how's that
for having your back?

37:55.765 --> 37:57.266
That's just like
a real fbi agent.

37:57.334 --> 38:00.002
Thanks a lot, cal.
What?

38:00.070 --> 38:03.539
So, uh, when'd you
first realize I was
undercover, dr. Lightman?

38:03.606 --> 38:05.574
Back at the poker table,
you were angry

38:05.642 --> 38:08.010
And fearful,

38:08.078 --> 38:10.312
But on my behalf.

38:12.816 --> 38:14.583
Ha, really?
Yeah.

38:14.651 --> 38:16.852
Come on, let's go.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.055
Ben? Hold on a second.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.256
I'll tell you what.

38:21.324 --> 38:23.225
Terry walks
for his part in this.

38:23.293 --> 38:24.360
What?

38:24.427 --> 38:26.028
And then we're evens.

38:26.096 --> 38:29.665
No, I couldn't have
done this without him.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.537
[scoffs] he goes from here
to the airport.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.740
And he doesn't come back.
Suits me.

38:37.807 --> 38:41.210
Ever. You know,
you are one lucky
son of a bitch.

38:41.277 --> 38:43.979
Hey. Hey, um,
can I borrow him
for a minute?

38:44.047 --> 38:45.147
Just personal stuff.

38:45.215 --> 38:47.182
Yeah, just,
just make it--

38:47.250 --> 38:49.151
Quick.
I knew you were

38:49.219 --> 38:51.353
Up to something the moment
you walked into my office.

38:51.421 --> 38:52.988
And then I had to sit there
and I had to watch you

38:53.056 --> 38:55.691
Play me like one of those
yuppies back in london.

38:55.759 --> 38:57.593
Mcclellan had me by
the short and curlies!

38:57.660 --> 38:59.361
My best mate!
Oh, come on!

38:59.429 --> 39:01.096
What, do you think
I wanted to do it?

39:01.164 --> 39:02.264
You were in on this
from the start, terry!

39:02.332 --> 39:04.400
They knew who I was
before I even sat down

39:04.467 --> 39:05.801
At that poker table.

39:05.869 --> 39:08.203
What was that?
That was just some
little test run.

39:08.271 --> 39:10.005
So what do you
call this, eh?

39:10.073 --> 39:12.408
Oh, a couple of broken fingers
for a slice of that pie?

39:12.475 --> 39:13.976
Do me a favor.

39:14.044 --> 39:17.146
And you can stop treating me
like a bloody moron now!

39:17.213 --> 39:19.415
Yeah, well, maybe I just
came to resent you, cal.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.116
Hate me, more like.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.418
Years will do that, terry.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.154
You saw all the way
through it, didn't you?

39:25.221 --> 39:27.790
You saw right through it
from the start.

39:27.857 --> 39:30.392
Still helped me,
though, didn't you?

39:30.460 --> 39:32.327
You know why?

39:32.395 --> 39:34.530
Because
you always have been

39:34.597 --> 39:35.964
And you always will be

39:36.032 --> 39:37.599
My best mate.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.435
Don't count on it.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.438
All right?
I'll tell you what.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.374
My debt is now paid,

39:45.442 --> 39:47.309
In full!

39:47.377 --> 39:50.512
No, wait a second,
wait a second.
You owe me now.

39:50.580 --> 39:54.116
Yeah, I saved your bacon
and I covered your ass
with the fbi!

39:54.184 --> 39:56.085
I'm a very lucky man.

39:56.152 --> 39:57.619
Yeah.

39:59.389 --> 40:01.790
Well, all luck is earned,

40:01.858 --> 40:03.859
In the end.

40:03.927 --> 40:06.528
Well go, then.

40:06.596 --> 40:08.864
Off you go.

40:19.008 --> 40:21.844
Don't you dare
look back.

40:38.962 --> 40:40.796
Hey.

40:40.864 --> 40:43.799
Have a seat.
Why?

40:43.867 --> 40:44.967
This is an intervention.

40:45.034 --> 40:47.236
What?

40:48.505 --> 40:51.073
All right,
so I had, you know,

40:51.141 --> 40:52.407
A few drinks
with a mate.

40:52.475 --> 40:54.543
Well, more than a few,
actually.

40:54.611 --> 40:56.378
This isn't about
drinking.

40:56.446 --> 40:58.680
Well, then
if it's about poker,

40:58.748 --> 41:00.215
I won a hundred grand.

41:00.283 --> 41:01.617
Hundred grand?

41:01.684 --> 41:03.552
Uh, 105, actually.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.354
It's not about
gambling, either.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.390
Well, what is it about, then?
It's about you trusting us.

41:08.458 --> 41:11.326
You were in trouble,
and you never came to us.

41:11.394 --> 41:13.228
Wait a minute--
no, you wait.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.563
We're a team.

41:14.631 --> 41:16.798
And you risked
your life without
letting us help you.

41:16.866 --> 41:19.368
Hey, I wouldn't
be here at all

41:19.435 --> 41:21.370
If it wasn't
for terry marsh.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.338
Fine. So where
does that leave us?

41:23.406 --> 41:25.707
That leaves you all fired.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.009
You gotta be kidding!

41:27.076 --> 41:28.277
I didn't even want
to do this intervention.

41:28.344 --> 41:29.411
Well, just you,
then.

41:29.479 --> 41:31.146
Just you are fired,

41:31.214 --> 41:32.948
For having
no spine.

41:33.016 --> 41:34.917
I don't believe this.
Good.

41:34.984 --> 41:36.218
'cause I'm lying.

41:36.286 --> 41:38.253
What, you didn't
spot that?

41:38.321 --> 41:40.322
Oh, did your
emotions get
in the way?

41:40.390 --> 41:42.157
You should really
work on that.

41:42.225 --> 41:45.961
Well, this has been
terrific.

41:46.029 --> 41:47.863
Really fantastic.

41:47.931 --> 41:49.498
Quite the intervention.

41:49.566 --> 41:52.768
We should do this again
soon, very soon.

41:52.835 --> 41:54.836
[scoffs]

41:56.940 --> 41:59.975
The intervention
was my idea.

42:10.053 --> 42:12.354
My mom died
when I was young,

42:12.422 --> 42:14.623
And my dad
was long gone by then.

42:14.691 --> 42:16.024
Terry and his family,
they took me in

42:16.092 --> 42:17.626
Even though there was no room

42:17.694 --> 42:19.461
And even less money.

42:19.529 --> 42:22.097
And one day, terry and I got
into a little bit of trouble

42:22.165 --> 42:24.299
With the police.

42:24.367 --> 42:27.903
Not your concern,
but they were on their way.

42:27.971 --> 42:30.872
And no way
we could get out of it

42:30.940 --> 42:34.209
Without one of us
acting as decoy
for the other.

42:34.277 --> 42:36.044
So terry took
the fall for you?

42:36.112 --> 42:37.879
Yeah, he did.

42:37.947 --> 42:41.116
He said, "you're supposed
to use that brain of yours
for something,

42:41.184 --> 42:42.451
"not be dragged down
into the muck

42:42.518 --> 42:44.753
By stupid bastards like me."

42:44.821 --> 42:46.555
He was right.

42:46.623 --> 42:48.190
Yeah, he was.

42:48.258 --> 42:50.092
Yeah.

42:50.159 --> 42:52.628
It cost him three years
of his life.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.997
So anyone
who wants to compete

42:55.064 --> 42:58.133
For my loyalty
with terry marsh,

42:58.201 --> 43:00.602
Not really
in a fair fight.

43:03.740 --> 43:06.074
Good night, love.
