00:04.713 --> 00:06.548
Goldie:
Up the chimney!
Down the chimney!

00:06.631 --> 00:08.174
Up the chimney!
Down the chimney!

00:08.258 --> 00:10.719
Up on the rooftop.
Jesus, Candy, slow down.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.137
Never!
I'll be named

00:12.220 --> 00:14.264
Successor
or die trying!

00:14.347 --> 00:15.557
Santa has to see

00:15.640 --> 00:16.891
I'm not just a powerhouse

00:16.975 --> 00:18.435
of ideas and efficiency.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.103
I'm a jacked-up beast

00:20.186 --> 00:21.521
who can toss
a 100-pound bag

00:21.604 --> 00:24.107
of toys over my shoulder,
like this!

00:24.190 --> 00:25.817
-(grunts)
-(cracks)

00:25.900 --> 00:27.902
(grunting)

00:27.986 --> 00:30.196
Cuthbert Ng:
Holiday News Network
breaking news.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.740
Live from Easter Island.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.409
Easter is cracking like
a motherfucking egg.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.453
Sources inside
Easter Enterprises

00:36.536 --> 00:38.246
tell us that Petunia Rabbit,

00:38.329 --> 00:40.457
daughter of the very
religious Peter Rabbit,

00:40.540 --> 00:43.752
is out as the company C.E.O.
after it was revealed

00:43.835 --> 00:45.712
that she's had
thousands of abortions.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.797
Oh shit!
There's Petunia now!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.090
Petunia! Petunia!

00:49.174 --> 00:50.133
Do you have
any comments

00:50.216 --> 00:52.343
about being fired
by your own father?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.929
Oh, yeah, my dad's
a fuckin' freak.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.724
I mean, he's a hypocrite
hiding behind religion.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.309
Who cares about
my personal life?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.853
What about the millions
of hard-boiled, pastel-dyed

01:01.936 --> 01:05.899
abortions hidden
in kids' yards
every Easter?

01:05.982 --> 01:08.318
Just stop
following me!

01:09.819 --> 01:12.447
(joyful music playing)

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
Good news:
You're a 75-year-old man

01:25.585 --> 01:28.171
with the body
of a 75-year-old lady.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.758
Because of your
womanly hips... get it?

01:31.841 --> 01:36.179
Why am I having another physical
so soon after Christmas Eve?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.139
The Board is so paranoid.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.683
I'm not gonna
keel over before
I pick a Successor.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.811
How about me
as the next Santa?

01:42.894 --> 01:44.854
I am a doctor,
and I deliver

01:44.938 --> 01:48.066
bad news to patients,
like presents. Get it?

01:48.149 --> 01:49.984
Of course I get it.
It's not subtle at all.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.570
Yep, I could be the next Santa.
My one stipulation?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.489
I don't work on Christmas.
Get it?

01:54.572 --> 01:56.866
And, oh, sorry, I don't
make house calls. Get it?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.661
The hell, man?
Why is my own doctor
makin' me sick?

01:59.744 --> 02:01.955
Which is actually
a good joke. Take notes.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.290
Just toss me
some‘zans,
and get lost.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.917
(phone chimes)

02:06.000 --> 02:07.961
Fuck! The board just
announced your date

02:08.044 --> 02:10.713
for choosing a Successor
is moved up to Thanksgiving.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.758
Why the fuck are we always
on Thanksgiving's time schedule?

02:13.842 --> 02:16.386
The whole holiday is
based on an imperialist lie.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.513
Not to mention,
the turkey is always dry.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.683
Everyone, relax.
This is my legacy.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.893
I don't want people dissin'
my ass when I'm dead.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.728
I'm okay being fondled
when I'm dead.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.897
If it makes some
necrophiliac happy,
go for it.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.358
-Life is for the living.
-I thought I figured
it out with Candy,

02:30.441 --> 02:31.901
and the whole,
like, woman thing,

02:31.985 --> 02:35.363
and then, she just fuckin'
blew it with the Board.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.823
I mean, yes, she has ideas,

02:36.906 --> 02:40.285
but can she
really be the face
of Christmas?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.078
Oh no!

02:42.161 --> 02:45.748
Unrelated, I used to model
in my 20s, hmm?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.041
To be clear, I am saying,

02:47.125 --> 02:49.210
I would make a very
photogenic Successor,

02:49.294 --> 02:51.796
so keep me in mind.
First gay Santa!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.507
Except for Nick the Ninth,
that closeted fuck.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.759
(knock on window)

02:56.843 --> 02:59.804
No!
Wash the fuckin' windows!

02:59.888 --> 03:01.055
Do you see what's
happening here?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.182
-I'm under siege.
-Hey!

03:03.266 --> 03:05.935
Get me out of here!

03:06.019 --> 03:09.188
Look at that.
You wanna be Santa, too.
Don't you, little man?

03:09.272 --> 03:12.108
Adorable, but also, you're
stressing me the fuck out.

03:12.191 --> 03:15.153
Literally getting pressure
from every direction.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.949
Ah! Ow! Ow! Ooh!

03:20.033 --> 03:22.201
(intense music plays)

03:22.285 --> 03:24.579
Hey!
I have a rape whistle!

03:24.662 --> 03:26.623
Ahh, this is my
consensual sex whistle.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.626
Fuck, where's my rape one?
Rape. Rape, rape, rape...

03:29.709 --> 03:32.587
Fear not sexual assault,
Candy Smalls.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.299
It is time to reveal
my true identity.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.469
Candy:
The tooth fairy?
Wait, no, President Nixon?

03:39.552 --> 03:40.803
Oh, just a bunny?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.306
I had some hard-hitting
questions for Nixon.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.683
I am not just
some bunny.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.728
I happen to be
the emissary
for Peter Rabbit.

03:48.811 --> 03:51.439
He'd like to interview you
at his home for C.E.O.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.232
of Easter Enterprises.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.901
Thanks,
but I'm not interested.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.028
Santa Inc. is my home,
and, I'll be honest,

03:57.111 --> 04:00.323
a company that denies
a woman her bodily autonomy,

04:00.406 --> 04:01.824
even for religious reasons,

04:01.908 --> 04:02.951
is not for me.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.911
Oh, that's the story
Petunia spread

04:04.994 --> 04:07.997
to hide the real
reason she was fired,

04:08.081 --> 04:09.999
her mental instability.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.211
Peter is heartbroken
about what has happened
with his little girl.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.837
Oh my god.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.424
This is the interview
of a lifetime, Miss Smalls.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.884
Think about it.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.306
Osama Bun Laden.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.185
Candy:
Oh my god, Santa
would freak if he knew

04:29.269 --> 04:31.020
I went to a job interview,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
and he's been weird to me

04:32.605 --> 04:35.066
ever since the State
of the Workshop speech.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.402
And Easter? Ham? Barf.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.904
I'm not eating trafe
unless it's shrimp cocktail,

04:39.988 --> 04:41.990
or, like, really good sushi...

04:42.073 --> 04:44.367
or, I guess, like,
anything from a raw bar.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.994
You should do it!
Nothin' makes a man

04:46.077 --> 04:47.912
appreciate you more
than seeing how bad

04:47.996 --> 04:50.164
some other fool wants you.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.166
-Play the game.
-I already got a game.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.919
-Being a mad-pimp
at my job, bitches!
-(bell rings)

04:55.003 --> 04:57.380
Jingle Jim (on speaker):
Lunch hour over. Back to work.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.299
Only 289 more days
until Christmas Eve.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.218
(yawns)
I'm taking a nap.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.429
Larson gave us
an extra hour
for lunch

05:04.512 --> 05:06.764
while the VIPs do
their private tasting.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
What?!
I'm a VIP!

05:08.808 --> 05:10.268
Why didn't you
mention this earlier?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.562
Because I have
a busy fucking life

05:12.645 --> 05:15.148
that doesn't include
keeping your schedule.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.776
I am so tired!
It's like I can barely--

05:18.860 --> 05:21.696
(snoring)

05:21.779 --> 05:23.990
Ahh!

05:24.073 --> 05:27.201
The gummy snakes are
much more realistic
this year, Larson.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.746
I thought I was
getting attacked
by snakes just now.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.997
Thank you,
thank you.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.749
My ladies,
they work hard.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.292
Wazzup, dudes?!

05:34.375 --> 05:37.086
Yeah, just found out
the candy tasting was today,

05:37.170 --> 05:39.088
which is bonkers,
considering I am

05:39.172 --> 05:41.758
-Stocking Stuffer Safety Czar.
-You were invited.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.469
Did the email go
to your junk folder?
The subject line was,

05:44.552 --> 05:47.263
"Do You Want a Bigger Penis?"
Get it? Junk folder?

05:47.346 --> 05:51.017
I save my junk folder
for Friday night reading.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.812
Last week,
I found out my cousin,
Gerhardt, has lupus.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.440
Will you just make sure
to mention the taffy valve flow,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.108
and the gummy-shaper protocol?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.235
Any lapse can
cause a messy spill.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.697
(sarcastically):
A messy spill? Oh no.
Sounds so important.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.783
Nurse, get us a moist
towelette, stat.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.869
-Not a messy spill.
-(group laughing)

06:10.995 --> 06:12.455
Ugh! I am out.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.874
And just so you know,
the women of the North Pole

06:14.957 --> 06:16.584
make fun of one of your dicks.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.961
Have fun wondering whose it is.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.756
Well, it's not me.
I have a beautiful penis.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.134
As I've been
told by my wife
and my doctor.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.011
Jeremy:
If I'm not a millionaire
by the time I'm 30,

06:27.095 --> 06:30.014
I am killing myself,
and that's a promise.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.516
Hey!
Is, uh, Candy around?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.309
I feel kinda shitty
about yesterday.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.602
Wanted to take
her to lunch.

06:34.685 --> 06:35.770
Ugh, I gotta go.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.855
Some fat guy just
barged into my office.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.315
Oh, she's not here,

06:39.398 --> 06:40.900
and I can't tell you why

06:40.983 --> 06:43.528
because I'm not
a blabbermouth...

06:43.611 --> 06:44.779
buuut...

06:44.862 --> 06:46.823
this goss is way too hot
to keep to myself!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.449
Candy went to interview
with Peter Rabbit

06:48.533 --> 06:50.993
to become C.E.O.
of Easter Enterprises!

06:51.077 --> 06:52.286
She what?!

06:54.205 --> 06:56.499
(light music playing)

07:04.048 --> 07:04.715
Oh.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.634
-La, la, la.
-(laughing)

07:07.343 --> 07:11.889
(grunting)

07:11.973 --> 07:14.851
Welcome to Easter Enterprises!

07:14.934 --> 07:18.729
Embrace the pastel.
Inhale the fake grass.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.525
Behold the basket.
Enjoy the mango--

07:22.608 --> 07:24.652
Ahh!
(grunts)

07:24.735 --> 07:27.280
Don't shoot!
That's... my mother.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.115
(whispers):
How did you know
I was here?

07:29.198 --> 07:30.491
Your assistant told me,

07:30.575 --> 07:32.201
but I am not
missing my chance

07:32.285 --> 07:33.995
to snag the Peter Rabbit.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.164
I've been masturbating
to his picture for years.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.875
I don't even
know what the back
of his head looks like.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.918
I wish I could be mad,
but I'm just so impressed

07:41.002 --> 07:44.046
you hung to the bottom
of a plane for three hours.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.215
Now please stay
out of my way
while we're here.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.300
(horse whinnies)

07:50.720 --> 07:54.557
Oh, but those teeth,
and those legs.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.475
Aye, aye, aye!

07:56.559 --> 07:58.603
Candy Smalls...

07:58.686 --> 08:00.730
Thank you for coming
to meet with me.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.648
I am quite an admirer.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.358
I read your op-ed
in "The North Atlantic."

08:04.442 --> 08:07.069
It made me feel,
and it made me think.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.113
That was exactly
what I was going for!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.908
And who is this
enchanting beauty?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.744
Your much younger
half-sister from your
father's third marriage?

08:14.827 --> 08:17.663
Oh, I'm her mom.
You're so handsome,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.416
just like I imagined
you'd be when I mastur--

08:20.499 --> 08:24.295
mastered the art of...
touching myself.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.300
-Jingle Jim: Ahh!
-(cat yelps)

08:33.262 --> 08:35.264
How about another
round before work?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.892
We can christen a new
bottle of poppers.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.353
Fuck yeah.
Bust that shit out.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.733
(grunting)
Oh god! Shit! Ah.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.236
-Gnarly!
-Oh.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.279
Girl, just jerk off
and sleep.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.530
Good luck!

08:52.698 --> 08:54.325
(phone ringing)

08:56.953 --> 08:58.621
Good morning, Santa.

08:58.704 --> 09:02.458
I can't come in today.
F-- Uh, food poisoning.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.418
Love you.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.963
Dammit.
Of all the days
for Jim to be sick.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.297
Everyone is turning on me.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
First Brent, now Candy.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.300
It feels terrible.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.802
I'm not good at comforting.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.804
You've never even said
one nice thing to me.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.599
Easter Island?
Easter fuckin' Island
of all fuckin' places.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.977
Candy fucking
backstabbing asshole.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.145
Your Jolly-ness,
I, I am Devin,

09:23.229 --> 09:27.024
intern to Candy, uh,
Duchess of Smalls.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.943
Cut that shit out.
Can I get some food?

09:29.026 --> 09:31.821
Gettin' low blood sug.
It's makin' me cranks-y.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.906
-Oh, ya think?
-(clears throat) If I may,

09:33.990 --> 09:37.618
uh, allow me to suggest
a meatball submarine, sir?

09:37.702 --> 09:40.329
-Uh, there's a place nearby--
-Yes, I'll drive.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.001
♪ ♪

09:45.084 --> 09:47.503
This place
is incredible.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.463
Delivering eggs makes
you a lotta money.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.507
Peter, is there
somewhere I can, uh...

09:51.591 --> 09:53.718
how do you say
this ladylike,

09:53.801 --> 09:57.680
scrub the travel
dust off my beaver?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.223
Put a comb
through my pubes.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
Mom, the man
runs Easter!

10:00.474 --> 10:01.350
He doesn't
wanna hear about

10:01.434 --> 10:03.269
your filthy
fucking genitals!

10:03.352 --> 10:04.645
I apologize, sir.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.897
Bathroom at the top
of the stairs, my dear.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.818
Let's get
right to it.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.695
Easter Enterprise
has always had

10:12.778 --> 10:15.197
a simple ethos,
community.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.742
I do the White House
Easter Egg Roll,

10:17.825 --> 10:19.535
but my sons
deliver the baskets,

10:19.618 --> 10:21.412
all of which are
handmade with organic

10:21.495 --> 10:23.080
and sustainable
material, of course.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.334
Communally run,
and environmentally
responsible?

10:26.417 --> 10:29.337
Wow, this is spank bank
material for me.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.630
As C.E.O.,
you'll be number one,

10:31.714 --> 10:33.716
and I don't know what
I'll do if you turn me down.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.009
You're the only candidate.

10:35.092 --> 10:38.804
Only me?
Well, I'm all ears!
Literally.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.014
Well, we both are.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.599
(both laughing)

10:41.682 --> 10:45.394
-Candy: Oh!
-Candy, meet my oldest son,
my heir, Peter the Third.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.813
P3. He's a bit of
a Candy Smalls fanboy,

10:47.897 --> 10:49.523
or more than a bit.
He's obsessed.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.068
Don't pay any
attention to him, Candy.
I'm not a stalker.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.070
I mean, I, I love your work,
but I, I, I don't, like,

10:54.153 --> 10:56.614
follow everything that you do.
I mean, I-I'm up to date

10:56.697 --> 10:58.240
on some of the thin--
I'm-- I just-- I'm a fan.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.784
No, no, no!
Be a stalker if you want.

10:59.867 --> 11:03.079
You're cute.
I could do worse.
I should be so lucky.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.747
-(P3 chuckles)
-Well, that's for sure.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.707
P42 just grew
out his man bun.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.668
Son, why don't you give
our guest the grand tour?

11:09.752 --> 11:12.755
And I'll show
her mom around.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.300
(snoring)

11:16.384 --> 11:18.302
Cookie, I just
saw you dozing off.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.763
-Can I do anything to help?
-Well, you could give me

11:20.846 --> 11:23.265
what most
industrialized
nations provide,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.142
health insurance
with maternity leave.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.812
It sickens my heart that
we don't provide that,

11:27.895 --> 11:30.022
-but what can you do?
-Revise the system?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.108
Prioritize empathy
and compassion?

11:32.191 --> 11:35.236
Ha! You and me both.
Okay, keep going, girls.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.946
Love your work ethic!

11:37.029 --> 11:38.531
(softly):
So sexy.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.448
Eww.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.703
-(snoring)
-(intense music plays)

11:45.538 --> 11:47.540
(high-pitched whirl)

11:47.623 --> 11:49.458
Devin:
We call them subs
'cause the shape

11:49.542 --> 11:51.377
is like
a submarine
of bread.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.047
I used to love these subs
when I was in school,

11:55.131 --> 11:56.924
and they're still good.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.968
So, uh... how's
the internship goin'?

11:59.051 --> 12:02.012
Candy is so cool.
She's a maverick,
ahead of her time--

12:02.096 --> 12:06.308
Candy?!
Devin, you know I chose
the first Black Successor.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.643
That was a big deal.
Everyone was like,

12:07.726 --> 12:09.103
"This is crazy!
You can't do this."

12:09.186 --> 12:10.980
And I was like,
"No, it's time.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.356
"You know what?
It's fuckin' past time.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.443
It was time a long time ago,
and now, it's long overdue."

12:15.526 --> 12:17.403
And everyone's like,
"He's Black. He can't do it."

12:17.486 --> 12:19.155
And I'm like,
"Fuck that! I know that,

12:19.238 --> 12:21.991
even though he's Black...
he can do it."

12:22.074 --> 12:23.367
Well, you made history.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.828
Holy shit!
I can't believe I'm bolstering

12:25.911 --> 12:27.705
Santa's seemingly fragile ego!

12:27.788 --> 12:29.915
Now, I'm basically back
to the drawing board, though.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.667
All I hear all day,

12:31.750 --> 12:33.002
(mockingly):
"Who's the new Successor?"

12:33.085 --> 12:36.213
"Please, make me
the new Successor."
(groans)

12:36.297 --> 12:39.216
Take today off.
Chill with me and my frat bros.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.801
-What house you in?
-Igma Loo.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.220
Dude, I was Igma Loo!

12:43.304 --> 12:45.222
God bless Igma Loo!

12:45.306 --> 12:47.183
-Everyone else is a pile of poo!
-...is a pile of poo!

12:47.266 --> 12:50.478
-Nice!
-Yeah, that's why I chose it
because you're my hero.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.396
I bought some of your
beard hair on the internet.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.358
-Look what I had it made into.
-It looks real. Jesus.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.360
Who in my house is doing this?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.779
You know what?
You're right.
I need a break.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.364
Let's go visit
the old house.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
If we hurry,
we can catch
the snowball fight.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.076
Oh, I used
to love those.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.247
Shovin' snow down
the bros' backs.
Wild times.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.916
-Devin: Knock his ass out!
-Frat Guy 1: Woo! Yeah!

13:11.999 --> 13:13.375
Frat Guy 2:
Turn him into water!

13:13.459 --> 13:15.794
Drink that fucker
for breakfast!

13:15.878 --> 13:20.007
-Make him bleed his own blood.
-Holy shit, things have changed.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.051
Yo, that fool Devin
brought Santa!

13:22.134 --> 13:24.178
Two mutha-fuckin'
kings among us!

13:24.261 --> 13:28.182
Frat Guys (chanting):
Kings! Kings! Kings!

13:28.265 --> 13:30.601
-(work horn blows)
-Ugh, I slept an hour.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.270
The baby went crazy,
and ate our guest room.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.065
We were in
the ER all night.
I feel like shit.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.692
-Yeah, you do look really bad.
-Fuck you!

13:38.776 --> 13:41.111
Get your roots done,
and then we'll talk.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.238
(gasps):
Shit!

13:42.321 --> 13:45.741
-Taffy spill! Evacuate!
-(all screaming)

13:45.824 --> 13:46.867
Where is Larson?!

13:46.951 --> 13:49.870
I love your lady brain
as much as your body.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.330
I love women.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.415
Cookie, we gotta go!

13:53.499 --> 13:56.210
If Larson is gone,
I'm the shift leader!

13:56.293 --> 13:58.420
I need to make sure
everyone's out safe!

13:58.504 --> 14:02.258
Even if it means
I can't go home
for days or months.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.010
(siren wailing)

14:05.094 --> 14:08.430
This is where
my brothers and I
train every year.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.016
Oh, look!
There are 400
of 'em over there.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.811
Hey, guys!
P240, P15,

14:13.894 --> 14:15.646
-love what you're doin'!
-Candy: Whew...

14:15.729 --> 14:18.023
I can feel the burn
in my glutes already.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.775
-(camera clicks)
-Oh, that was
for my trainer.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.735
She'll be impressed
I got a workout in.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.779
P3:
A trainer?
You're in perfect shape.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.948
Oh, sorry.
That was inappropriate.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.576
I mean... what's
"perfect" shape anyway?

14:28.659 --> 14:29.660
I-- It's all subjective.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.328
I mean, you're
my perfect shape.
For me.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.664
I mean, for a girl that
I'd be attracted to.
I mean--

14:33.747 --> 14:37.459
Oh no, anytime you wanna
compliment my body, I consent.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.670
(chuckles)
And, you know, I feel,

14:39.753 --> 14:41.380
I feel like being
a leader requires

14:41.463 --> 14:43.132
mental and physical strength,

14:43.215 --> 14:46.093
so I push myself...
hard.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.761
You know,
I'm talking quads,

14:47.845 --> 14:50.264
delts, trips, septets,

14:50.347 --> 14:52.850
hambones, all of‘em.
The whole thing.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.018
I envy your career.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.145
I mean, resurrection,
it's bullshit, right?

14:56.228 --> 14:59.189
We only have one life to live.
We gotta give it all we got.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.190
Candy:
What are
your dreams?

15:00.274 --> 15:01.984
Uh, to blow up
this island,

15:02.067 --> 15:04.320
and boil two-thirds
of my family in a stew?

15:04.403 --> 15:06.655
-(laughs)
-Not you P83!

15:06.739 --> 15:07.740
You're great!

15:07.823 --> 15:09.408
(both laughing)

15:09.491 --> 15:12.202
My quarters, which brings
us to the end of the tour,

15:12.286 --> 15:16.165
-and our time together.
-No! I don't want it to end.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.834
Well, maybe it
doesn't have to if
you can convince

15:18.917 --> 15:20.336
your daughter
to take the job.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.587
Wouldn't that
be wonderful?

15:21.670 --> 15:22.921
All of us...
together.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.174
Oh, if I can't
convince Candy
on merit,

15:25.257 --> 15:28.427
I'm happy to roofie her.
I've done it before.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.304
It's so hot when you joke about

15:30.387 --> 15:31.847
committing crimes
against your daughter.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.974
Where does that
old saying come from,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.225
"Fuck like rabbits"?

15:35.309 --> 15:38.854
(laughs)
I mean, it's never
"Fuck like llamas,"

15:38.937 --> 15:42.232
or pigeons,
but "fuck like rabbits."

15:42.316 --> 15:43.692
Care to explain that to me?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.944
Let me show
you instead.

15:46.028 --> 15:50.074
-(grunting)
-(giggling)

15:50.157 --> 15:51.992
Big Candy:
I like the size
of that carrot.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.037
-(rock music playing)
-(Frat Guys cheering)

15:55.120 --> 15:57.998
This is way better
than being at work.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.458
(laughs)
Come here!

16:00.918 --> 16:03.337
-Yeah!
-(Frat Guys cheering)

16:07.424 --> 16:10.010
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.804
P3:
I have to show you something.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.555
You know when I said
I wasn't passionate

16:13.639 --> 16:15.307
about anything in my life?

16:15.391 --> 16:17.059
That wasn't true.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.852
Wow, look at all
these tapestries.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.897
I, I never thought yarn
could give me the chills.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.191
The pathos you get
out of this, it's--

16:24.274 --> 16:25.693
Really?
Oh my god.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.361
Wow, I'm so happy
you like them.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.029
Uh, no one knows
about this place,

16:29.113 --> 16:31.365
but you made
me brave enough
to speak my truth.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.158
Actually,
to scream it.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.619
(shouts): I hate
the corporate world,

16:35.703 --> 16:38.580
and I love
weaving tapestries!

16:38.664 --> 16:42.000
Yes! Oh my god!
I feel alive!

16:42.084 --> 16:44.294
-Yes!
-(both laughing)

16:47.339 --> 16:48.966
You have
beautiful ears.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.094
So perky and big.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.762
-May I touch them?
-Sure.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.307
I mean,
they're nothing compared
to your long, furry ones.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.101
(moans)

16:59.685 --> 17:01.186
(moans)

17:01.270 --> 17:05.023
(sensual music playing)

17:07.401 --> 17:08.318
(moans)

17:11.029 --> 17:14.491
-(phone ringing)
-Fuck. It's the office.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.034
Hey, Jer.
Everything okay?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.328
Jeremy (on phone, crying):
No, I'm at the candy factory.

17:18.412 --> 17:22.666
It's a mess, and everyone
in charge of shit is M.I.A.!

17:22.750 --> 17:25.002
Candy:
It's because those assholes
didn't take the proper safety

17:25.085 --> 17:27.713
measures during that tasting.
Is anyone hurt?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.131
Jeremy:
One lady worker is stuck.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.632
She looks dead,
but she's snoring,

17:30.716 --> 17:32.134
so I think she's sleeping.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.636
Mmm, sweet relief.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.638
Calm down.
I'll be back soon.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.640
Aw, I need
to leave, but...

17:38.724 --> 17:41.435
I've decided to accept
your father's offer.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.314
(Santa groaning)

17:51.904 --> 17:54.531
Thank you for today.
For real, I feel
so unstressed

17:54.615 --> 17:56.408
for the first
time in weeks.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.119
-You really helped me.
-Are you kidding me?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.788
You helped me out.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.456
I brought Santa
to a party!

18:02.539 --> 18:03.916
I've got serious
street cred

18:03.999 --> 18:05.751
for the first time
with my bros.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.837
Mmm, I know it looks like
I'm just another Igma Loo,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.506
but the bros can be mean,

18:10.589 --> 18:14.301
they make fun of my hair,
my clothes, that I'm dyslexic--

18:14.384 --> 18:17.054
Dude, I'm dyslexic as fuck, too.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.055
-You are?
-Santa: Yeah!

18:18.138 --> 18:19.348
How did you pull it together?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.850
I mean... look at you.
You're Santa.

18:21.934 --> 18:26.063
Well, uh, I became
the class clown,
and then, I got fat,

18:26.146 --> 18:28.190
which made me even
more hilarious.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.360
Fat men are very funny,
but fat women are disgusting.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.571
I get it.
People laugh so hard
when I push my fat gut

18:34.655 --> 18:37.199
around my belly button,
and call it a "hair bagel."

18:39.201 --> 18:41.036
Let's maybe
change out that shirt.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.955
-I think we're the same size.
-Really?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.289
I mean, I'm just
eyeballin' it here,

18:44.373 --> 18:47.000
but I feel like you
might be a little
fatter than me.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.044
Fatter than Santa?

18:49.127 --> 18:50.295
Thank you!

18:50.379 --> 18:51.588
So, Candy's
going back,

18:51.672 --> 18:52.756
but then,
she's quitting.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.883
(laughs)
We did it, son.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.844
Santa Incorporated
is going down.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.220
Suck on this, Nick!

18:58.303 --> 18:59.555
We can't do this, Papa.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.056
Shut it! Listen to me.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.976
That piece of jolly shit
has destroyed Easter.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.686
Do we have
a Black Friday?
No!

19:05.769 --> 19:08.146
Are kids worried they
won't get a basket
of shitty candy

19:08.230 --> 19:10.399
and cheap-ass
stuffed animals?
No!

19:10.482 --> 19:12.734
Easter used to be
the biggest holiday
out there.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.571
Then Santa fucked us.
But no more!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.323
Once we get all the secrets
of Santa Inc. out of Candy,

19:18.407 --> 19:20.993
I will rule the holiday world!

19:21.076 --> 19:24.830
Christmas will be as
important as one of those
dog-shit Jewish holidays.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.748
And Easter will happen
every month of the year.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.918
Fuck the resurrection.
Peter Rabbit will
be the new Jesus.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.420
Watch out world!

19:31.503 --> 19:33.589
(evil laughter)

19:33.672 --> 19:35.591
But, Papa, this
seems too big for--

19:35.674 --> 19:40.053
This was a simple
seduce and destroy mission,
and now you're backing out?

19:40.137 --> 19:43.348
You'll basically
be Jesus' son,
which makes you--

19:43.432 --> 19:46.810
Oh, I don't fuckin'
know the guy's name,
but you'll be huge!

19:46.894 --> 19:47.895
We all will be.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.646
Do you even care
about this company?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.815
I am not a company man!

19:51.899 --> 19:55.777
To be honest,
I'm more of a crafts... man?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.363
I make tapestries.
That's my passion.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.781
(chuckling)
Tapestries?

19:59.865 --> 20:01.450
You're a rabbit,
not a pussy.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.702
Just shut up
with that shit,
stick to the plan,

20:03.785 --> 20:05.579
and soon enough,
Santa Inc., Santa,

20:05.662 --> 20:08.123
and Candy Smalls
will be screwed.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.125

Here, put on my sweatshirt.

Mom, your
vagina's out!

20:23.430 --> 20:25.849
Alarming and sexy,
my go-to style.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.267
Anyway, we
need to scram.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.686
Peter only wants
you here to settle
a grudge with Santa.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.356
But he loved
my article about
global warming.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.941
That was just a scam, Candy.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.485
My father's hatred of Santa
has turned his heart evil.

he calls his guards!

Looks like the spill
is safely under control,

23:55.433 --> 23:56.434
but it makes us think:

23:56.518 --> 23:58.520
With the pressures of
choosing a Successor,

23:58.603 --> 24:00.522
has Santa started
to lose it?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.899
The Successor
will be with us
for a generation,

24:02.983 --> 24:05.402
and Santa is wise
to take his time.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.946
The only newsworthy
story here is
that Santa Inc.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.282

smoothly ever!

It's good to have you back.
That is, if you are back.

lost you to Peter Rabbit.

Oh my god.
Peter Rabbit's
fucking insane.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.138
I mean, his offer was
fucking insane... the offer.

24:33.221 --> 24:36.558
It was just so much.
So many benefits,
so much freedom.

24:36.641 --> 24:40.437
But, you know,
I realized, whether you
make me Successor or not,

24:40.520 --> 24:43.940
I would rather be
a team player here
at Santa Inc.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.817

the whole show there.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.737
