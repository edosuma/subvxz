00:02.733 --> 00:05.400
-(clucking)

00:05.433 --> 00:07.667
-(crows)

00:09.467 --> 00:11.533
-Oh, no.
-(crowing continues)

00:11.567 --> 00:14.233
-Adele's a rooster.
Adele is a man.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.133
-Oh, I can't deal
with it today.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.167
She can just be a girl
for another day.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.267
-(door clattering)
-Ugh. Hello?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.300
-Josh:
Claire!

00:23.333 --> 00:26.700
-Ugh. So, thanks for
picking me up, you dicks!

00:26.733 --> 00:29.500
-(door slams)
-The taxi driver kept
calling me "princess"

00:29.533 --> 00:31.200
and he sang
"A Whole New World" to me.

00:31.233 --> 00:32.567
-Arnold and I are coming down.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.167
We took drugs.
Tom broke his wrist.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.333
It was all very exciting.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.133
-God, it's not a whole
new world, is it?

00:37.167 --> 00:38.100
It's the same world.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.800
Only difference now is
that I've got no money.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.767
It's nice to finally
meet you, Arnold.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.467
-You're very pretty.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.233
-Yeah, okay.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.767
-* One, two

00:48.800 --> 00:50.300
* One, two, three, four

00:50.333 --> 00:51.800
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

00:51.833 --> 00:55.300
* Yeah, I'll be fine,
yeah, yeah *

00:55.333 --> 00:57.467
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

00:57.500 --> 00:59.200
* Oh, yeah, here

00:59.233 --> 01:00.800
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

01:00.833 --> 01:02.033
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:02.067 --> 01:03.500
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

01:03.533 --> 01:04.633
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:04.667 --> 01:08.067
* I left better behind
to be fine *

01:08.100 --> 01:09.800
* Yeah, yeah, fine

01:09.833 --> 01:12.633
* Make my mama
turn another blind eye *

01:12.667 --> 01:14.733
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

01:14.767 --> 01:17.367
* I left better behind
to be fine *

01:17.400 --> 01:19.600
-(crows)

01:19.633 --> 01:20.700
-(clucking)

01:20.733 --> 01:23.567
-Why won't she learn?

01:23.600 --> 01:26.333
-Maybe she has all the answers
and just can't get it out.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.067
-No, I don't think so.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.333
I'm pretty sure she's just...

01:29.367 --> 01:32.500
she's yelling,
"I'm a fuckin' dude!

01:32.533 --> 01:33.733
"I'm a fuckin' dude!

01:33.767 --> 01:37.267
Wake up, everybody,
and check out my mohawk!"

01:37.300 --> 01:39.167
-(Adele crows)
-Okay.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.767
I'm sectioning off
this bit of the cast.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.067
This is my bit, okay?

01:44.100 --> 01:46.100
Everyone else can
be boring in their section,

01:46.133 --> 01:48.167
but this is mine.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
I own it, okay?

01:49.233 --> 01:50.733
-Yes, it's yours.

01:50.767 --> 01:51.667
-Ella:
Okay.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.600
So, I'm going to write
your dreams in it.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.667
Tell me your dreams.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.633
-I don't really have any dreams.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.767
-What are your dreams, Thomas?

02:03.200 --> 02:07.533
-Lately, I've been thinking
about how I really want

02:07.567 --> 02:09.200
to go on a water jetpack.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.833
-Water...

02:13.867 --> 02:15.700
jetpack.

02:15.733 --> 02:17.700
I am writing it down
because I believe that

02:17.733 --> 02:19.100
it's a legitimate dream.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.767
But they can't all
be this silly, okay?

02:21.800 --> 02:22.667
-Okay.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.633
-Okay. Next dream?

02:24.667 --> 02:25.833
-I don't know.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.667
I just-- I don't have
any dreams worth

02:27.700 --> 02:28.567
writing down.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.700
-If you can't be real
about this, Tom,

02:30.733 --> 02:31.900
then this section
of the cast

02:31.933 --> 02:34.833
is going to be left blank,
and everybody's going to think

02:34.867 --> 02:36.200
that you just
don't have enough

02:36.233 --> 02:37.533
friends to fill a cast.

02:37.567 --> 02:39.767
So, it would be a shame,
wouldn't it?

02:41.267 --> 02:42.633
We'll continue this tomorrow.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.467
-So I think I'm in love
with Adele,

02:49.500 --> 02:50.833
the transgender chicken.

02:50.867 --> 02:54.267
-Yeah? Yeah, I am just
so in love with her.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.467
-Claire:
What are our options?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.800
-Josh:
We can take her back
to the farm.

02:56.833 --> 03:00.400
They will kill her,
but we do get a refund.

03:00.433 --> 03:03.467
$15, which we'll probably use
to buy a roast chicken.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.800
-Delicious.
-Mm-hmm.

03:04.833 --> 03:08.433
Or we can Google
how to kill her humanely,

03:08.467 --> 03:10.100
kill her and eat her.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.433
-Do you think we could
even enjoy eating her?

03:12.467 --> 03:15.700
-No. No, we'd all
just be so sad.

03:15.733 --> 03:17.433
-Well, you've always said
that you wanted to raise

03:17.467 --> 03:18.700
your own meat.
You always pontificated

03:18.733 --> 03:21.067
about how disconnected
society is from meat.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.100
-Did I? Was that me?

03:23.133 --> 03:24.367
-Oh, yeah.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.800
Like "meat is so pre-packaged
and neat, but meat isn't neat.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.133
"Meat is messy,
and you think it's noble

03:29.167 --> 03:30.267
to kill and eat
your own meat."

03:30.300 --> 03:31.733
-Yeah, but not Adele.

03:31.767 --> 03:33.367
Adele is such a babe.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.600
-I think that she's had
a better life than most

03:35.633 --> 03:38.567
of the chickens we've eaten,
so I think it's okay.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.667
I think it is just okay
that we eat her.

03:40.700 --> 03:41.767
-I mean, we have to, yeah?

03:41.800 --> 03:45.133
I've really been pontificating
about it for years.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.567
Hey.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.833
-Arnold, I think
we're gonna eat Adele.

03:48.867 --> 03:50.167
-Yeah.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.067
-It's not right.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.233
She doesn't have to die
just because she was born a man.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.700
It's like China,
but in reverse.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.400
-If we want to eat her
on Sunday, then we're going to

04:01.433 --> 04:02.600
have to kill her on Saturday.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.033
-What?!
-Oh, Tom.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.433
Um, we have some bad news.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.333
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-It's the best thing we can do.

04:08.367 --> 04:09.300
-No!
-Yes.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.700
-I'm out.
-Can't be out.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.200
-Can't we just get her desexed?

04:12.233 --> 04:13.467
-No, that's not a thing.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.700
-You're not killing Adele.

04:14.733 --> 04:15.800
-It's time to put on

04:15.833 --> 04:17.533
your big boy pants
and kill Adele.

04:17.567 --> 04:19.667
-Tom, if we don't kill Adele,
then a stranger will kill Adele,

04:19.700 --> 04:21.233
and we can't let
a stranger kill Adele.

04:21.267 --> 04:23.133
I wouldn't want you to let
a stranger kill me.

04:23.167 --> 04:25.367
-You can't kill Adele in front
of Shakira and Beyoncé.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.833
I don't want Shakira
and Beyoncé to live in fear.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.267
-We'll need a cone to stop her
from running around.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.200
So, that's a fun job.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.033
You and Ella can go heist
a traffic cone.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.500
-Big boy pants time.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.200
-Whatever.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.667
-Don't you dare give me a job.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.333
-Okay. Claire, we're going
to build an isolation cage.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.033
-An isolation cage?

04:44.067 --> 04:47.567
-Um, we need to isolate Adele
for 24 hours before we kill her

04:47.600 --> 04:49.100
so that she doesn't eat.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.500
-Aw, that's not a very fun job.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.633
-(laughs)

04:56.067 --> 04:58.333
I don't have a chance with you.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.167
-Yeah, we should even things up.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.833
I should be handicapped
or something, right?

05:01.867 --> 05:04.033
-I'll get the axe.
-(Rose laughs at Stuart)

05:04.067 --> 05:05.167
-It is awful, yeah?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.800
Like, I don't just think
it's awful 'cause it's my mum.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.267
-What do you think
of my orchid?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.233
-Good things.

05:10.267 --> 05:12.100
It's a-- it's a good orchid.

05:12.133 --> 05:15.433
-My psychiatrist makes
me keep it so I learn
to trust myself.

05:15.467 --> 05:16.367
-Right.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.400
-Orchids are very hardy
actually, Hannah.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.667
They do very well
on their own in the wild.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.200
-Maybe I should just release it.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.067
-Josh:
I killed an orchid once.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.633
-Did it learn to help
you trust yourself?

05:25.667 --> 05:27.167
-No.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
-I thought you might bring
Claire for a visit.

05:29.233 --> 05:32.700
-No. Um, she is...
she's jet-lagged.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.233
She's all jet-lagged.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.833
-They say it takes
four times as long

05:35.867 --> 05:40.067
for the soul to reach the same
destination as the body.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.567
So, when you arrive
at your destination,

05:43.600 --> 05:45.467
your soul takes days
to catch up.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.667
-What a lovely thought.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.200
-Is that a lovely thought?

05:49.233 --> 05:52.567
Is it lovely to imagine
Claire's soul drifting

05:52.600 --> 05:54.333
all alone across the ocean?

05:54.367 --> 05:55.800
-Don't be sarcastic, Joshy.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.067
-He's okay.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.733
He's just testing
the boundaries.

05:58.767 --> 06:00.367
Two men in the house
and all that.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.567
-(scoffs)

06:01.600 --> 06:02.633
No.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.567
Stuart, honestly...

06:04.600 --> 06:07.100
you...

06:07.133 --> 06:10.367
feel free to inhabit
all the boundaries.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.767
-I chose a dog
from the pound once.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.033
Called it Dipstick.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.400
And on the way home
from the pound,

06:15.433 --> 06:19.100
Dipstick jumped off my lap,
out the open window

06:19.133 --> 06:21.233
and under an oncoming truck,

06:21.267 --> 06:23.233
and Dad just kept driving.

06:23.267 --> 06:25.333
We never spoke of it again.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.667
-(crows)

06:35.067 --> 06:36.667
-Remember when
we were high on MDMA

06:36.700 --> 06:38.700
and Ella asked us
about monogamy?

06:38.733 --> 06:40.533
-Yes.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.033
-I just...

06:42.067 --> 06:43.833
I've always thought
monogamy was archaic.

06:43.867 --> 06:47.833
Like an unnecessary
pressure on relationships?

06:47.867 --> 06:50.233
-You want to go and have sex
with other boys?

06:51.867 --> 06:53.333
-I really like sex.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.067
I think that's okay.
You like sex.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.800
Sex is fun, and as long as
we're smart and safe,

06:57.833 --> 06:59.667
it's, like, negligible risk.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.133
Can you tell me
what you're thinking?

07:05.167 --> 07:06.100
-Uh...

07:06.133 --> 07:08.233
I think this sounds
like a shit deal for me,

07:08.267 --> 07:10.467
you going off and having
fun sex with other boys.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.700
You know I have nothing on.

07:11.733 --> 07:15.167
-It's only if we're out of town
or whatever, and I would never

07:15.200 --> 07:17.567
replace time with you
for time with another boy.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.600
-Is it 'cause you're going
on maths summit?

07:19.633 --> 07:20.667
Is that why?

07:20.700 --> 07:21.500
-No.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.767
-This a pre-maths summit chat?
-No.

07:25.467 --> 07:27.033
-What if you go off
and have some sex

07:27.067 --> 07:29.533
with some maths genius
and then you fall in love

07:29.567 --> 07:30.633
with the maths genius?

07:30.667 --> 07:32.633
-I'm not going to fall in love
with a maths genius.

07:32.667 --> 07:36.100
-All I know is that A squared
plus B squared equals C squared.

07:36.133 --> 07:36.833
Is that even good?

07:36.867 --> 07:38.033
Is that a good thing to know?

07:38.067 --> 07:39.800
-Honestly, whether we're open
or not, it isn't going to

07:39.833 --> 07:41.400
protect you from
me falling in love

07:41.433 --> 07:43.500
with some maths genius.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.200
If I find someone
better than you,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.800
then that's just tough.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.367
-I don't know!

07:50.400 --> 07:52.667
Can you give me an example?
An example of a dream?

07:52.700 --> 07:55.233
-Okay, so I would like

07:55.267 --> 07:56.433
to be a teacher
in a rough neighborhood

07:56.467 --> 07:59.733
who makes all the students
realize that hip hop is the same

07:59.767 --> 08:01.500
same as poetry,
and then they rap Shakespeare

08:01.533 --> 08:02.300
to me as a surprise.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.500
-Yeah, that's good.
Put that down.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.000
-No, you can't have my dream!

08:06.267 --> 08:09.433
-Sometimes I fantasize
about being a hero...

08:09.467 --> 08:12.400
in a plane crash or a fire...

08:12.433 --> 08:14.633
but then that seems
like a selfish dream

08:14.667 --> 08:16.200
because that means
people have to get hurt

08:16.233 --> 08:18.200
just so I can feel tough.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.033
-Okay, I'll just write
"be masculine."

08:21.067 --> 08:22.233
-Not that!

08:24.767 --> 08:25.867
-Okay.

08:25.900 --> 08:30.133
So we've got water jetpack,
being able to eat bread,

08:30.167 --> 08:32.500
and feeling masculine.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.433
-Yeah, I'm quite happy
with that, actually.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.167
-Why are there two orchids?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.333
-Rose:
Oh!

08:44.367 --> 08:46.700
I'm going to join you
in the orchid task.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.667
-No.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.633
-Yes.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.367
-No, this is not
a team building exercise.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.367
-Oh.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.600
-It's a phalionopsis bloom.

09:01.867 --> 09:04.200
-It's even the same as mine.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.033
-Yeah, it's the same flower.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.767
What, you don't even know
the name of your own orchid?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.267
-It's Michael.
-Oh.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.667
-Is Ella staying over
again again?

09:13.700 --> 09:16.167
-I just have no idea
what's going on.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.033
-Is she homeless?

09:17.067 --> 09:19.500
-Maybe. Or maybe
she just likes Tom.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.967
Equally concerning.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.700
-You couldn't have told me
that Tom has got another
annoying girlfriend?

09:23.733 --> 09:24.800
-Oh, come on.
She's all right.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.167
-She's exhausting.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.400
(imitates Ella)
Oh, my name's Ella.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.800
Let's go skipping at the beach
and have breakfast at midnight.

09:29.833 --> 09:30.667
-(chuckles)

09:30.700 --> 09:32.400
-Not exactly a new way
to be, is it?

09:32.433 --> 09:33.667
-Ella: I can hear you.
-(gasps)

09:33.700 --> 09:34.900
-I wasn't trying to.

09:34.933 --> 09:37.067
It's just that there aren't any
doors between where you are

09:37.100 --> 09:39.100
and where I was,
and I have ears.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.033
-I'm so sorry.
-No...

09:40.067 --> 09:42.200
-No, it's fine. Really.

09:46.433 --> 09:47.600
-You see?

09:47.633 --> 09:50.233
It's like watching
a Disney princess trying

09:50.267 --> 09:51.467
to make it
in the modern world--

09:51.500 --> 09:52.633
-Ella:
What the actual hell?

09:52.667 --> 09:53.767
I can still hear you
with my ears.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.667
-Claire:
Sorry!

09:54.700 --> 09:56.333
-(door slams shut)

09:58.700 --> 10:00.500
-(crows)

10:03.600 --> 10:05.333
-Okay, so you know
when you were a kid

10:05.367 --> 10:06.467
and you thought
you had to grow up

10:06.500 --> 10:08.767
and marry a girl and have kids
and how you wanted that?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.367
-No. I never wanted kids.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.167
I resented even being a child.
-(chuckles)

10:12.200 --> 10:14.333
And then you slowly realized
that wasn't possible

10:14.367 --> 10:17.667
and everything you'd imagined
for your future just fell away?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.067
-Yes, okay.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.133
-Well, now we get to
make our own rules.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.300
Monogamy is like
the Big Foot of adult life.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.833
Everyone claims to know
someone who knew someone

10:25.867 --> 10:28.167
who knew a couple
that did it successfully,

10:28.200 --> 10:29.267
but it doesn't exist.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.767
-Okay, I agree.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.067
-I just-- I never want us to
wake up next to each other

10:33.100 --> 10:35.300
and think,
"Ugh, you again."

10:35.333 --> 10:36.667
-Yes, okay.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.800
I heard you
and I said I agreed.

10:39.833 --> 10:41.567
-Okay, good.
-Okay.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.200
-(sighs)

11:05.767 --> 11:07.333
Josh?

11:09.267 --> 11:10.467
Josh?

11:11.867 --> 11:13.333
Claire?

11:15.833 --> 11:17.200
Guys?

11:17.233 --> 11:20.367
-(clucks)
-Hey. Hey, Adele.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.800
It's all right.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.433
Yes, Adele,
I'm sorry, okay?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.467
I'm sorry,
it's just really gross

11:27.500 --> 11:29.633
to eat you if you've
already eaten, okay?

11:29.667 --> 11:31.167
I'm sorry.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.200
Try harder climbing
the food chain.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.600
-Ella's refusing
to come over anymore.

11:34.633 --> 11:36.333
-You two really fucked me.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.567
I had a tiny light of happiness,
and you stamped it out.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.000
-Is she really upset?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.333
-She's not coming to either
eat or kill Adele anymore
thanks to you.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.367
-How long do you think
you're going to be angry
like this for?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.700
-At least three more minutes.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.133
-Can we just skip it?

11:47.167 --> 11:48.467
-I want something
as an apology.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.667
-What do you want?

11:49.700 --> 11:51.667
-Chocolate mousse.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.333
-Okay, we'll make you
chocolate mousse.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.233
-Tom:
Good. Thank you.

11:55.267 --> 11:57.067
-Oh, Tom,
Josh has agreed

11:57.100 --> 11:58.467
to an open relationship
with Arnold.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.667
-Oh my God! Yes!

12:01.700 --> 12:02.667
High five!

12:02.700 --> 12:04.400
-No, I don't know.
I don't know if high five.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.667
-I wonder if Ella would want
an open relationship.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.500
She's cool.
She's so cool.

12:08.533 --> 12:09.833
-Urgh, okay,
I'm going back inside.

12:09.867 --> 12:12.500
I promise I will text Ella

12:12.533 --> 12:13.733
and I will be
incredibly nice to her.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.633
I will be so nice.

12:19.233 --> 12:21.433
-Is it just me,
or is Claire...
-Josh: No.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.600
-...being crazy about Ella?

12:23.633 --> 12:25.367
-No, she is not
in love with you.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.700
-Everyone wants my D.
It is exhausting, am I right?

12:29.733 --> 12:30.833
-No.
-Tom: I'm right!

12:30.867 --> 12:32.200
-Nobody wants it.
-(chuckles)

12:34.167 --> 12:35.267
-Hey, lady.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.567
Hey, lady.
-(clucks)

12:40.100 --> 12:41.667
-Oh, I got rid
of your shower gel

12:41.700 --> 12:44.233
'cause Josh told me
that those plastic microbeads

12:44.267 --> 12:46.167
are getting into the fish gills.

12:50.467 --> 12:51.567
-(refrigerator door closes)

13:08.267 --> 13:10.067
-Tea always makes
me feel better, Michael.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.500
-What did you do today?

13:21.533 --> 13:24.100
-I spent most of the day
hating Claire.

13:24.133 --> 13:25.333
She sounded so hateful.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.167
It made me feel so frivolous.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.433
-Yeah, she's been weird
since she got back.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.200
She's usually not awful.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.233
-And then I read about slaves.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.233
The world is broken, Tom.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.633
Do you know there are
more slaves now than ever?

13:38.667 --> 13:39.800
21 million.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.333
And they make things we buy.

13:41.367 --> 13:43.767
Like, we directly fund it
all the time.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.133
-Yeah, I know.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.500
-Do you care?
-Yeah!

13:46.533 --> 13:48.533
I buy fair trade chocolate.

13:48.567 --> 13:49.633
Ooh!

13:49.667 --> 13:52.133
I like that it tastes less like
poor people's tears.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.333
-I really cared.

13:53.367 --> 13:55.433
I thought, "This won't do,"
and then ten minutes later,

13:55.467 --> 13:58.367
I moved onto looking at Claire's
Facebook page and hating her.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.167
Then she accepted
my friend request,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.467
so I moved on and spent
half an hour looking

14:02.500 --> 14:04.633
at viral marketing videos
aimed at women,

14:04.667 --> 14:06.467
telling women they're beautiful
just the way they are

14:06.500 --> 14:09.800
and then trying to sell
them concealer or yogurt.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.367
Why do they only sell
yogurt to women?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.700
Like, men eat yogurt.

14:13.733 --> 14:16.067
My dad, he loves yogurt.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.700
-I like yogurt.
-Gay.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.167
-(chuckles)
-I signed an online petition

14:20.200 --> 14:21.233
trying to give women

14:21.267 --> 14:22.767
in Saudi Arabia
the right to drive.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.567
So, don't worry Tom,
that's sorted. Fixed that.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.667
Between Hermione and me,
feminism's basically fixed.

14:28.700 --> 14:29.700
-Yeah. Good job.

14:29.733 --> 14:30.867
-Like, I did it all

14:30.900 --> 14:33.700
thinking that I was helping
solve the world's issues.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.067
But I wasn't, was I?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.433
I didn't achieve anything.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.633
Kony never seemed bothered.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.367
I was just jerking off my soul,

14:40.400 --> 14:43.533
trying to glean
a smug self-satisfaction

14:43.567 --> 14:45.067
from other people's pain.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.500
I convinced myself
that I was doing good,

14:46.533 --> 14:49.433
but really, I was just
using other people's pain

14:49.467 --> 14:52.100
as an accessory
to make me look cool and nice,

14:52.133 --> 14:54.233
trying to convince myself
and the world that

14:54.267 --> 14:56.567
I'm a better person
than Claire.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.100
Do you think
I'm just the worst?

14:58.133 --> 15:00.267
Using the world's problems
to make me feel better

15:00.300 --> 15:02.767
about a mean thing
that a pretty girl said?

15:02.800 --> 15:05.733
-Um, I don't think
you're the worst.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.367
I think you're the best.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.733
Like custard.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.600
-I mean, I just don't know
what to think.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.367
Maybe it helped.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.033
In a democracy,
if you want change,

15:15.067 --> 15:16.167
you have to change
people's minds,

15:16.200 --> 15:17.467
and people look
at the Internet.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.700
-People like cats now.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.067
-Fuck cats.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.167
After all that, Claire called
and she sounded pretty,

15:24.200 --> 15:26.500
and she invited me
to come and kill Adele,

15:26.533 --> 15:29.267
which was nice,
and I pretended not to care

15:29.300 --> 15:31.667
care about the fact
that she used Disney against me.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.233
-Okay, um...

15:35.267 --> 15:38.333
you know that you're,
like, so pretty, right?

15:38.367 --> 15:40.600
I-- I would bang
every Disney princess.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.433
-Nala? You want to bang Nala?

15:42.467 --> 15:43.733
-Not Nala. Only humans!

15:43.767 --> 15:45.333
-So you wouldn't
bang Little Mermaid

15:45.367 --> 15:46.300
when she was a mermaid?

15:46.333 --> 15:48.533
-Well, obviously I'd bang Ariel.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.333
-Oh, I hate the fact that
I'm more annoyed about it

15:56.367 --> 15:57.833
because she's pretty.

15:57.867 --> 15:59.600
That shouldn't matter.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.133
-Hey, baby.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.133
-Oh, thank God you're here.

16:13.167 --> 16:14.567
I was going to feed Adele
a bit of octopus,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.200
but I'm not allowed to.
It's against the rules.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.633
-Octopus is, like, the most
intelligent creature on earth.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.067
You can't feed it
to a chicken.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.067
That'd be like letting
Pitbull eat Nietzsche.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.467
-Dog breed or the singer?

16:23.500 --> 16:25.533
-Does it matter?

16:25.567 --> 16:28.333
-It's just I've fallen deeply
in love with this little lady.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.133
-Are you ready
to come inside now?

16:31.167 --> 16:33.300
-She just looks so lonely.

16:33.333 --> 16:36.300
-Yeah, you put her in
an isolation cage.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.100
-(crows)

16:46.200 --> 16:47.533
-Hey...

16:47.567 --> 16:48.667
(whispering)

16:48.700 --> 16:51.400
-So this is...
this is still happening?

16:51.433 --> 16:53.033
-Yeah.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.067
-Tom:
'Cause I've just realized

16:54.100 --> 16:56.500
that you haven't realized
that this is insane,

16:56.533 --> 16:58.233
and usually you would have
realized by now.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.100
-Claire:
Okay, so there's two ways
that we can do this.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.100
We either just
cut her head clean off

17:02.133 --> 17:03.400
or we stick in the knife

17:03.433 --> 17:05.133
and then we just
cut the jugular.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.033
Uh, the jugular way is better.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.367
Um, only if you do it
right, though,

17:08.400 --> 17:09.467
and seeing that
this is our first time,

17:09.500 --> 17:11.400
I think that we should
just cut her head right off.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.133
-Okay, everyone heard
that, yeah?

17:13.167 --> 17:14.400
-Tommy, I need you
to hold the cone.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.033
-I don't think I can, actually.
-I can hold it

17:19.433 --> 17:21.833
Adele, you're being
such a trouper.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.433
-Okay.

17:25.167 --> 17:26.367
-Fuck!

17:27.600 --> 17:29.367
-Okay.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.467
Okay...
We love meat, yeah?

17:31.500 --> 17:32.167
-Yep.
-Mm-hmm.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.533
-We love meat.
Circle of life.

17:33.567 --> 17:34.600
Hakuna matata, yeah?

17:34.633 --> 17:35.633
Yeah? Tom?

17:35.667 --> 17:37.467
-Yeah.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.667
-Okay.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.467
-Claire:
Josh, it's time, yeah?

17:44.833 --> 17:46.367
-Adele, Adele...

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
No. No.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.100
-Well, do it or take her
out of the thing!

17:53.300 --> 17:55.067
-Yes.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.800
-Okay, okay...

17:57.833 --> 17:59.333
-Here we go.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.233
No!

18:04.267 --> 18:05.100
-Do it!

18:05.133 --> 18:07.233
-Do it, Josh!
-Tom: Josh, just do it!

18:10.400 --> 18:11.733
-No. Actually, no thank you.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.433
Yeah, not today. No thanks.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.700
-Okay, fine.
-Yeah.

18:14.733 --> 18:15.600
-(grunts)

18:17.233 --> 18:18.767
-(wings flapping)
-She's not dead. She's not dead!

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
-She's dead, okay?
She's just twitching.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.700
She doesn't have a head.
She's not feeling anything.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.700
You did it. Hey, great job.
We did it. Hey.

18:24.733 --> 18:25.700
I'll take Adele, yeah?

18:25.733 --> 18:26.900
-Claire:
Um... (sniffles)

18:26.933 --> 18:29.333
that is... Can you get me
something to wipe the blood on?

18:29.367 --> 18:30.533
-On it, on it.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.733
-Claire:
Thanks.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.600
(breathes heavily)

18:34.767 --> 18:37.100
-* Doo wop wop wop wop

18:37.133 --> 18:39.233
* Bop doo wop wop wop wop

18:39.267 --> 18:41.367
* Bop doo wop wop wop wop

18:41.400 --> 18:43.667
* Bop doo wop wop wop wop

18:43.700 --> 18:46.200
* Bop doo wop

18:46.233 --> 18:48.333
-Your orchid's leaves are
going yellow, Hannah.

18:48.367 --> 18:49.800
-Is that bad?
I thought it was cute.

18:49.833 --> 18:51.700
-Oh, you've just overwatered it.

18:51.733 --> 18:54.100
-Told you they thrived
on neglect, didn't I?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.567
-I've failed Michael.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.233
It's a good thing I'm never
going to be a parent.

18:59.267 --> 19:00.600
-What, never?

19:00.633 --> 19:02.367
-Never ever.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.733
-That's a shame,
with those hips.

19:05.533 --> 19:08.367
-You think it's a shame
I'm not having kids

19:08.400 --> 19:10.467
because my hips are large?

19:10.500 --> 19:12.333
-Yeah, you got hips
for Australia.
-Oh, my God.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.733
-No use for 'em.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.533
-Wow, it is a shame, isn't it?

19:15.567 --> 19:18.233
It's like my-- my hormones
pulled a real swifty.

19:18.267 --> 19:19.367
They thought,
"Let's make this one

19:19.400 --> 19:21.300
into the ultimate
baby carrying vessel,"

19:21.333 --> 19:24.500
then they gave me absolutely
no desire to make one,

19:24.533 --> 19:26.767
as if they think I'm going to
get pregnant in the desert.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.433
-Like a camel.
-Oh, come on.

19:28.467 --> 19:29.567
Hannah's not a camel.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.333
-Yeah, whoever put me together
didn't budget, did they?

19:32.367 --> 19:33.667
Like...

19:33.700 --> 19:36.667
I'm a walking graph
of the distribution of wealth,
aren't I?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.333
All the poor people.
Donald Trump.

19:39.367 --> 19:40.533
-Hold on, Hannah.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.500
It wasn't my intention
to upset you.

19:42.533 --> 19:43.800
-Oh, don't be so modest, Stuart.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.233
You meant it.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.367
You just didn't expect
that I'd retaliate.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.267
You know, usually,
sprinkle a little shame,

19:49.300 --> 19:50.633
and a woman will wilt.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.633
Isn't that right, Stuart?

19:51.667 --> 19:53.533
-Come on, Hannah.
He said he didn't mean it.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.233
-Why are you defending him?

19:55.267 --> 19:57.067
-I'm trying to be neutral.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.567
-Just settle down.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
It was just an observation.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.267
Didn't know you'd
be so sensitive, did I?

20:02.300 --> 20:04.100
Didn't know you wanted kids.

20:04.133 --> 20:05.633
-I don't want children.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.833
What is want is
you not to think about it.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.833
It's none of your business.

20:09.867 --> 20:12.800
Do you go up to people
in wheelchairs and just say,

20:12.833 --> 20:17.033
"'Oh, you should get a desk job.
You've got half the furniture."

20:32.767 --> 20:34.800
-Claire:
Okay, I've got something
I want to say

20:34.833 --> 20:36.267
and I don't want
you to make fun.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.233
-Okay.

20:37.267 --> 20:40.833
-Um, I've been... very lonely.

20:40.867 --> 20:41.733
-Okay, not fun.

20:41.767 --> 20:42.767
Not fun.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.333
-No. Um...

20:44.367 --> 20:47.667
I actually went three days
and I only spoke to one person,

20:47.700 --> 20:49.833
and it was the woman
who owned the fruit shop,

20:49.867 --> 20:51.533
and she asked me
what I was wanted to cook,

20:51.567 --> 20:53.600
and then called me "liebling,"
and I was so happy

20:53.633 --> 20:56.167
for the entire night
because someone

20:56.200 --> 20:59.067
who who didn't want to fuck me
called me a nice name.

20:59.100 --> 21:01.033
And so, I went back every week
and bought vegetables

21:01.067 --> 21:02.533
I didn't need,
and eventually I had to

21:02.567 --> 21:04.700
throw the vegetables away
away because I had no one
to cook them for.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.233
-Okay. I do not know
what you want me to say

21:07.267 --> 21:08.633
if I'm not allowed
to make fun of that.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.667
-I just don't understand
how it was shit.

21:10.700 --> 21:14.467
Like, how was moving
to Europe to work a bad plan?

21:14.500 --> 21:15.333
It's a good plan.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.167
It's a plan that
interesting people make.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.267
-Is it? Or is it a choice
people pretend is interesting

21:20.300 --> 21:21.633
when on the phone
to their parents?

21:21.667 --> 21:23.800
-Can you just shut up
and indulge me?

21:23.833 --> 21:25.767
Just indulge me
for like five minutes?

21:25.800 --> 21:26.800
-No.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.367
No, we don't
indulge each other.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.033
I'm not indulging. No.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.733
-You're not going to indulge me?
-No.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.600
-Okay, fine. Great.
Run's over then.

21:33.633 --> 21:35.100
-All right.

21:35.133 --> 21:36.700
-Wait! No.

21:36.733 --> 21:38.300
-No?
-Um, guess what?

21:38.333 --> 21:40.033
-Um, you are moving to Germany?

21:40.067 --> 21:41.233
-No, I'm pregnant in my belly.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.667
There is a human
forming in my belly,

21:42.700 --> 21:44.700
and I have to get an abortion,
obviously and I refuse

21:44.733 --> 21:46.067
to feel bad about it
because they are

21:46.100 --> 21:48.233
just cells, and every
time they decide

21:48.267 --> 21:49.767
to multiply, they are making
a horrible decision

21:49.800 --> 21:51.300
and they need to be stopped.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.133
-Okay, right.

21:54.167 --> 21:55.700
Fuck.

21:55.733 --> 21:57.200
-Yeah.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.333
We aren't telling
anyone else about this.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.833
I need someone
to go to the clinic with,

22:00.867 --> 22:02.733
and you're the best
that I have.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.167
-Yeah.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.200
Sure. Whatever you like.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.733
-Okay.
-Yeah.

22:10.833 --> 22:12.500
-Well, that's done.

22:12.533 --> 22:13.600
-Yeah.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.433
-All right, I told you, so...

22:17.467 --> 22:18.500
-We're still running?
-Yep!

22:18.533 --> 22:19.567
-Oh.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.367
-(both clucking)

22:25.600 --> 22:27.600
-Josh:
Okay, should we, um...

22:27.633 --> 22:31.167
should we, like,
say something, you know?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.733
-Grace?
-Yeah, let's say grace.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.533
-No. We don't say grace.

22:34.567 --> 22:36.267
-We don't say grace.

22:36.300 --> 22:39.033
-Maybe we can just hold hands
and say thank you for Adele.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.633
-Uh, that's grace.

22:40.667 --> 22:43.567
-No, actually it's just
holding hands and saying
thank you for Adele, not grace.

22:43.600 --> 22:48.400
Uh, thank you, Adele,
for giving up your life
so that we can continue ours.

22:48.433 --> 22:51.033
-Well, she hardly gave it up.
You stuffed her in a cone.

22:51.067 --> 22:52.767
-Okay.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.700
-Let's say nice things
about her.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.833
I liked how friendly
she always was.

22:56.867 --> 22:58.667
-No, don't remind me
she was friendly.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.200
-(sighs)

23:04.167 --> 23:06.267
-* I heard

23:06.300 --> 23:09.367
* That you settled down

23:09.400 --> 23:13.467
* That you found
a girl and you're *

23:13.500 --> 23:16.600
-Tom and Ella:
* Married now

23:16.633 --> 23:19.067
* I heard that your

23:19.100 --> 23:21.700
-All:
* Dreams came true

23:21.733 --> 23:28.033
* Guess she gave you things
I couldn't give to you *

23:28.067 --> 23:34.267
* Old friend,
why are you so shy? *

23:34.300 --> 23:37.700
* Ain't like you to hold back

23:37.733 --> 23:41.567
* Or hide from the light

23:41.600 --> 23:44.600
* I hate to turn up
out of the blue, uninvited *

23:44.633 --> 23:48.300
* But I couldn't stay away,
I couldn't fight it *

23:48.333 --> 23:51.500
* I had hoped you'd see my face
and that you'd be reminded *

23:51.533 --> 23:56.367
* That for me,
it isn't over *

23:56.400 --> 24:02.267
* Never mind,
I'll find someone like you *

24:02.300 --> 24:09.033
* I wish nothing
but the best for you, too *

24:09.067 --> 24:15.533
* Don't forget me, I beg,
I remember you said *

24:15.567 --> 24:21.633
* Sometimes it lasts in love,
but sometimes it hurts instead *

24:23.400 --> 24:29.767
* Sometimes it lasts in love,
but sometimes it hurts instead *

24:32.667 --> 24:36.400
-(silverware clinking)
