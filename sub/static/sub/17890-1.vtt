"This is Angry Bob, the man with
the industrial dick!"

05:39.437 --> 05:42.774
"Coming at you loud and clear
on W.A.R. Radio."

05:43.088 --> 05:46.368
"Rise and shine folks
it's a beautiful day."

05:46.226 --> 05:49.656
"Just look at that sky,
it's a work of art!"

05:49.710 --> 05:56.861
"Nature never knew colors like that.
When you look at it, be sure to wear your shades!"

05:56.954 --> 06:01.509
"The radiation count is way up
and the heatwave ain't expected to let up either."

06:01.399 --> 06:06.232
"Weather control tell us it will probably hit
110 downtown, before nightfall."

06:06.527 --> 06:11.310
"As for the good news...
There is no fucking good news!"

06:11.844 --> 06:16.047
"So let's rock with one of our golden oldies..."

06:26.233 --> 06:28.285
New York Max,
that's the place to make it now.

06:28.369 --> 06:36.103
You're talking 9000 tons of steel, 4000 tons of
aluminium. 5-6 million miles of copperwire.

06:36.246 --> 06:40.485
kitchen appliances, typewriters.
audio gear, tons of autoparts!

06:40.514 --> 06:45.680
Works of art, hanging in the galleries
Just hanging there, waiting to be plucked.

06:45.925 --> 06:51.400
Clothing, tupes, bridgework, false teeth,
prosthetic limbs...

06:51.418 --> 06:54.365
You name it, New York has got it all.

06:54.666 --> 06:58.845
No one is going to repopulate The Big Apple,
not with the rad count the way it is.

06:58.871 --> 07:04.292
You know, stuff is just going begging!
Salvage City, Max...You'll love it.

07:04.818 --> 07:06.813
Don't call me Max.

07:09.344 --> 07:15.893
Well, well well. Hard Mo Baxter.
Taking a little vacation?

07:16.002 --> 07:18.287
Is this authorized?

07:18.494 --> 07:21.780
What do you care?
Nothing that comes in here is authorized.

07:21.985 --> 07:25.556
Oh, untrue. I'm primarily legitimate now...

07:25.346 --> 07:27.597
Maybe we should go elsewhere then Alvy?

07:27.808 --> 07:31.105
No, no, wait untill I get my glasses!

07:30.689 --> 07:34.427
Are you sure? We can go somewhere...
No, no, just wait...

07:37.740 --> 07:40.510
That Alvy...
He kills me every time.

07:44.282 --> 07:46.017
My back.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.532
Christ!

07:53.039 --> 07:54.616
Where is the little man?

07:54.937 --> 07:56.538
He's indisposed...

07:58.190 --> 07:59.804
You pushing something?

08:02.420 --> 08:04.004
See what his shit is.

08:19.193 --> 08:20.754
Let me see.

08:27.487 --> 08:28.771
Where did you find it?

08:28.802 --> 08:33.760
Glass flats, Judas sea,
looking all over.

08:34.491 --> 08:36.073
I give you 30.

08:37.143 --> 08:38.919
40?

08:41.548 --> 08:43.634
50...Is that alright?

08:45.661 --> 08:47.822
I knew you'd see it my way.

08:52.969 --> 08:54.836
Merry Christmas.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.619
What the fuck was that?!

09:02.009 --> 09:03.779
A zonetripper.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.967
I've seen his type...
The whole sea is full of them.

09:08.193 --> 09:11.502
Who was that?
Someone looking for the bathroom, come on!

09:12.323 --> 09:14.783
I put my boot in his ass
and sent him on his way.

09:14.523 --> 09:16.652
Why don't he piss in the street,
like everyone else?

09:18.796 --> 09:22.091
Show me!
Where did you get this?!

09:23.122 --> 09:28.536
Out in the zone, what do you think it is?
Probably a maintenance droid.

09:28.537 --> 09:31.419
Stepped on a fragmine I guess.
You think so?

09:31.931 --> 09:37.478
It's not alot I can do with this.
It's got good visual circuits, infrared...

09:37.479 --> 09:44.987
Unusual microgear...
I give you 30 c's cash in hand.

09:45.082 --> 09:49.004
30 c's...You are a generous man
but I think I will hold on to it.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.129
This is junk,
what are you gonna do with it?

09:52.208 --> 09:57.312
It's christmas eve Alvy, you should know that.
You used to be an elf, didn't you?

09:57.174 --> 10:00.154
You can't expect me to go back to
my girl empty handed, can you?

10:00.588 --> 10:02.397
You don't know my girl...

10:02.367 --> 10:03.952
How much for the other stuff?

10:04.210 --> 10:06.229
10 c's is as high as I go...

10:06.580 --> 10:11.234
Yep Alvy, your as high as you ever gonna go.

10:14.378 --> 10:19.085
Can't help it if mother caught a dose in the big one.
Come on.

10:19.904 --> 10:25.325
You just wait. All those years out in the zone
your kids will make me look like narcissis.

10:55.545 --> 11:00.963
"Hey, hey folks! Rise and shine."

11:01.115 --> 11:05.501
"I got an update here on the conflict we all know and love."

11:05.495 --> 11:11.776
"The deathtoll from last nights violation
of the christmas ceasefire is still rising."

11:12.050 --> 11:19.968
"It currently stands at around 578,
with the counterattack now well underway."

11:20.416 --> 11:25.598
"I send this message of holiday cheer
to all of you:"

11:25.599 --> 11:29.342
"Kill, kill, kill!"

12:00.009 --> 12:05.041
Yo, hey miss Wakowski.
Vernon, the sonofabitch was at my door again.

12:04.815 --> 12:07.885
Who?
I don't know. I didn't see him, he just keeps ringing my bell.

12:07.837 --> 12:10.782
Then how do you know it's the same guy?
Vernon, it is.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.737
I couldn't see anybody
Yes...that's what worries me.

12:13.654 --> 12:16.582
Let me speak to Chief
He's out on his rounds.

12:18.801 --> 12:21.646
Don't worry miss Wakowski,
we'll keep our eyes peeled.

12:22.234 --> 12:26.823
Listen Vernon I...hey!
I've got a delivery coming up this morning.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.421
Be sure you let him up this time.
Will do.

12:32.517 --> 12:35.763
"As planned, the emergency population control bill..."

12:35.939 --> 12:38.693
"will take affect at midnight, on the first of the year."

12:38.791 --> 12:42.662
"Eager citizens are already lining up
at sterilization centers."

12:42.611 --> 12:45.788
"Wich will be opened around the clock
to aid in the transition"

12:45.855 --> 12:49.290
"to what the President terms:
A clean break from procreation."

12:49.355 --> 12:51.100
"In a related story..."

12:51.296 --> 12:55.712
"The two creators of the population control bill
was found dead yesterday..."

12:56.278 --> 13:00.938
"Ready...on...boil."

14:05.328 --> 14:07.644
You took a beating on that deal man.

14:07.996 --> 14:11.280
That zonehead fell asleep
and you were still jacking up the price.

14:11.491 --> 14:13.512
Well, I just want Jill to be happy.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.023
That's what I like about you, Max.
You're a real romantic.

14:22.781 --> 14:24.099
You're the cabby?

14:24.202 --> 14:29.108
Where you guys going?
Downtown.

14:34.683 --> 14:37.703
You guys like music?
Check these guys out.

14:42.738 --> 14:44.774
Used to be okay down here,
you know that?

14:45.032 --> 14:47.101
Used to be, you could walk
down here any time.

14:46.924 --> 14:50.014
Go out on a saturday night
with just brassknuckles, nothing else.

14:50.241 --> 14:53.341
Maybe a piece of wood, piece of
pipe, you know what I mean.

14:53.472 --> 14:56.332
Nowdays you need a gun all the time.

14:56.415 --> 14:59.803
Fucking bunch of shit, what these people
are doing to the fucking world.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.508
It's the same every time man. The minute
I'm back on earth, I wanna be in space again.

15:06.670 --> 15:09.582
Yeah right. Till one of you boosters
blows up under you...

15:09.582 --> 15:11.686
or your heatshield ripps off
on the way home.

15:11.686 --> 15:14.931
Hey, don't knock it.
Dying in space is real easy.

15:14.880 --> 15:19.434
One pssst and you're gas...spread
out over a thousand miles of stratosphere.

15:19.607 --> 15:21.843
Jesus man! Think of the view.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.704
No more sitting in a bunker
coughing your guts out.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.591
Waiting for your first cancer cells to show
or kids to be born blind and blue

15:29.627 --> 15:34.586
Because I mean, you have had one trip to many
or caught snake-eyes in a genetic crap game.

15:34.845 --> 15:39.492
Jesus, do you think Jill wants you to go on
wading around up to your arse in...

15:39.546 --> 15:41.693
radioactive iodine for the rest of your life.

15:41.779 --> 15:44.332
Think she liked it better if I ended up
like one of these bums?

16:08.246 --> 16:09.861
Holy shit!

16:10.085 --> 16:13.495
What the hell happened here? This
was a respectable building a few months ago.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.576
Some drugged out joyrider drove
a landcruiser through the security gates.

16:17.968 --> 16:19.628
You just can't keep ém out.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.938
This place is going to hell.

16:38.692 --> 16:41.918
Christ! They are all over the place.
Somebody ought to help these people...

16:42.060 --> 16:44.588
or clear them out.
They just keep coming back Max.

16:44.901 --> 16:48.764
Nothing's gonna keep them out except for
sealing this place up like a bunker.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.611
That's not such a bad idea.

17:01.378 --> 17:05.675
Does she know you're back Max?
I didn't want to wake her.

17:05.446 --> 17:07.849
Do you think she is going to let you stay?
Of course she will.

17:07.925 --> 17:11.547
She sleeps better when I'm around.
Makes her feel more secure.

17:13.255 --> 17:17.268
That's a laugh man!
She couldn't be more secure, then she is now.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.647
She's sealed in tight!
She doesn't need your help.

17:21.146 --> 17:24.086
She doesn't stick her little toe out
if she don't need to.

17:24.122 --> 17:25.618
How do you know?

17:27.297 --> 17:31.516
I keep an eye on her.
Good...keep it up.

17:33.329 --> 17:37.425
When I'm not around...
see nothing happens to her.

17:44.514 --> 17:47.918
You've been away a long time man.
What are you going to tell her?

17:49.221 --> 17:52.902
She understands.
She knows what kind of job I do.

18:01.485 --> 18:03.746
Jill! It's me, Mo. You home?

18:14.680 --> 18:17.333
Mo?
Are you going to let me in or what?

18:19.159 --> 18:22.881
I changed the code.
She changed the code?

18:25.939 --> 18:31.318
Come on Jill. It's Mo. I'm back.

18:40.604 --> 18:42.766
Hey baby.
Hello.

18:43.686 --> 18:48.404
Second level's low today.
I've had warmer hellos.

18:55.645 --> 18:58.277
It's been a while.
Yeah.

19:08.732 --> 19:11.528
How's it going?
Fine.

19:12.492 --> 19:15.120
How are you?
Pretty good.

19:16.747 --> 19:20.804
Got a job costumizing these consols
for these uptowners.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.387
Welfare checks are coming in...
can't complain.

19:25.281 --> 19:30.348
See my new pet? I've been using it for modeling.
Woke up this morning and made a web.

19:31.036 --> 19:35.486
What you feed it?
Sometimes I catch a bug.

19:36.603 --> 19:38.322
Sucks them dry.

19:40.453 --> 19:43.413
I've got something else you'll like.

19:44.370 --> 19:47.496
I've been basing my work more on
organic forms but...

19:47.850 --> 19:50.446
sometimes by the time I'm finished
it's hard to tell.

19:51.246 --> 19:55.272
It's like I'm fighting with the metal and...
so far the metal is winning.

19:55.277 --> 20:01.972
It's...very...powerfull.

20:02.272 --> 20:05.751
Thanks Shades.
Jill, I got something for you!

20:16.815 --> 20:18.468
God!

20:20.259 --> 20:23.529
It's horrible...I love it.

20:24.779 --> 20:27.591
What is it?
Maintenance droid I think.

20:27.766 --> 20:31.476
I picked ém up out in the zone. Probably
somekind of new design they are testing out.

20:31.511 --> 20:34.078
Thought you could make an ashtray out of this.

20:35.323 --> 20:40.599
Just look at the workmanship, it's so beautiful.
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

20:41.926 --> 20:44.205
You don't look so bad yourself.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.446
Merry Christmas baby.

20:54.645 --> 20:56.752
It's good to see you Mo.

23:28.162 --> 23:33.785
Spread those lips.
That's it...oh yeah.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.382
Oh yeah.
Oh that's it baby.

23:38.167 --> 23:43.884
Take that big dick! Yes.
Take it all the way in, that's it.

23:44.384 --> 23:46.381
All the way in.

23:51.731 --> 23:55.179
Take it. Suck him dry.

23:55.573 --> 24:00.158
That's it baby, you got him now.
God, you're beautiful!

24:01.457 --> 24:06.140
Yeah, that's it baby.
Take that big dick, take it in.

24:06.266 --> 24:13.632
Yeah...oh yes. Yeah.
Take him baby...squeez that tube.

24:14.005 --> 24:20.138
Yeah...come on. Yeah.
Take him, suck it dry.

24:24.066 --> 24:29.901
That's it...That's my bitch!
Yeah...squeez it!

24:43.475 --> 24:48.758
Fucking bitch.
God I love you.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.020
Sweet.

27:08.550 --> 27:12.945
"This is a military file. Do not proceed

27:13.024 --> 27:16.217

29:01.164 --> 29:05.202
...widespreed deficiency related diseases
in the inner city.

29:05.574 --> 29:09.012
Elsewere in the news:
Popular support has been swift and loud

29:09.099 --> 29:12.102
for the proposed emergency population
control bill.

29:12.265 --> 29:13.750
The bill would mandate...

31:28.944 --> 31:32.537
It's raining.
What?

31:33.947 --> 31:38.807
I thought it was raining.
God, I wish.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.683
I was dreaming.

32:05.874 --> 32:10.321
I could hear the rain...
on the glass.

32:17.648 --> 32:22.823
And you were laying beside me...
in the dream.

32:42.494 --> 32:47.043
I like it.
Really, I think it's okay.

32:49.926 --> 32:54.625
Where did you get all the babydolls?
Shades found a whole box of them in the streets.

32:54.892 --> 32:57.813
Well I provided the crowning touch, eh?

32:58.845 --> 33:01.784
Did you hear about the new population
bill they are trying to put through?

33:03.372 --> 33:04.278
No.

33:04.388 --> 33:07.194
They are trying to stop people from
having kids in the next few years.

33:07.249 --> 33:09.574
Gonna levy fines against people
that have to many.

33:09.578 --> 33:13.410
Take away their ration coupons.
Sterilize people who already have...

33:13.510 --> 33:18.416
high enough doses of radioactivity.
It will never work.

33:19.857 --> 33:24.459
It's our nature to reproduce.
To live on.

33:24.960 --> 33:30.340
Man has always gone against their nature.
Used to be natural to die of old age before 30.

33:30.452 --> 33:32.369
What are you saying?
You like the idea?

33:32.618 --> 33:38.998
No, I just...think it's stupid and suicidal
and sadistic to have children right now.

33:39.124 --> 33:43.588
Stupid, sadistic and suicidal...
The three S's.

33:44.365 --> 33:47.864
That's how I feel.
That's how you feel, eh?

33:49.197 --> 33:52.475
And what is this?
Somekind statement about all that?

33:52.615 --> 33:55.856
No.
Because if it is, I don't get it.

33:56.198 --> 34:00.973
You know, what's the head supposed to mean anyway?
It doesn't mean anything!

34:01.016 --> 34:04.253
It's...it's not for you.
It's not for anybody.

34:04.752 --> 34:08.866
I guess not. All I'm saying, is that
it be nice if you could sell something

34:08.969 --> 34:12.770
every once in a while, wouldn't it?
Look, I'm doing alright on my own.

34:12.873 --> 34:15.100
I don't need anything from you.
I don't know about that.

34:15.101 --> 34:17.943
Goverment takes a pretty big hunk
out of my paycheck every month.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.725
Where do you think your welfare checks
are coming from, eh?

34:20.762 --> 34:23.322
What do you want me to do?
You want me to join your corps?

34:24.467 --> 34:26.982
Think of what our radioactiv kids
will be like then.

34:27.672 --> 34:30.243
I stopped thinking about kids
a long time ago.

34:35.755 --> 34:39.632
You always say that things will change.
Maybe they will.

34:40.016 --> 34:44.440
Oh yeah they will...they will.

34:45.101 --> 34:47.368
They are going to get worse
before they get better.

34:50.063 --> 34:54.018
Survival of the fittest.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

34:55.512 --> 35:00.944
Oh yeah I like that.
And why not? I'm one of the fittest.

35:02.505 --> 35:05.381
Keep asking myself why
I let you in everytime.

35:05.651 --> 35:07.354
Why the fuck do I let you in?

35:10.061 --> 35:11.653
Great.
I'll get it.

35:11.812 --> 35:15.180
No, don't answear it!
What are you scared of?

35:26.460 --> 35:28.859
Alvy ?!
I got to see you.

35:29.002 --> 35:31.866
Sorry to call you so late,
but it's important.

35:31.969 --> 35:33.733
Jesus Alvy! Talk to me in
the morning.

35:33.957 --> 35:38.186
No, no no! It has to be now!
I'm talking about big bucks! Savy?

35:38.480 --> 35:42.738
Meet me in the yard in one hour
and bring the MARK-13 with you.

35:42.947 --> 35:45.902
The what?
Oh no...the skull and bones

35:46.093 --> 35:49.629
No way Alvy! Forget it.
Hear me out!

35:49.681 --> 35:53.883
I can't talk on the phone...to many ears.
Meet me in one hour.

36:00.513 --> 36:07.454

More legs then a fucking spider.

36:52.333 --> 36:57.159
See these mighty buildings. It all shall
be thrown down and shattered to splinters.

36:57.573 --> 37:02.384
The earth will shake, rattle and roll.
The masses will go hungry, their bellies bloat

37:02.447 --> 37:06.331
These are the birth pains.
No flesh shall be spared.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.647
Yeah, that's it brother.
You just keep walking away.

38:33.869 --> 38:39.309
Yeah.
Hi baby.

38:48.834 --> 38:50.546
Mo?

39:32.431 --> 39:35.281

Hello?

39:36.277 --> 39:39.876
Hello, this is Mo!
Who is this?

39:40.439 --> 39:43.626
I told you baby, this is Mo.
Look, I wanna come back.

39:43.865 --> 39:47.123
I'm ready to go again. I'm hard
again just thinking about you baby.

39:49.389 --> 39:51.313
What you say we try it up the ass, eh?

39:51.704 --> 39:55.808
How about I fuck you with a string of popcorn up your ass?
Who is this?!

39:55.910 --> 40:00.327
Then I pull it out real slow...pop by pop.
You think you'd like that?

40:00.633 --> 40:05.216
Think you ready to try the Hershey Highway, eh?
Fill you all the way, eh?

40:05.548 --> 40:08.773
What do you say Jill?
Fuck yourself asshole!

40:46.784 --> 40:53.681
I have a pain...here!

40:54.836 --> 41:05.114

This is serious man!

46:59.508 --> 47:02.307
It's cool...it's cool...it's cool.

47:05.220 --> 47:09.667
What's wrong with you Shades?
I can feel my heart.

47:10.686 --> 47:14.002
Shades, what's wrong with you?
It feels like an alligator.

47:14.062 --> 47:16.302
Shades, what's wrong with you man?!

47:20.725 --> 47:27.161
You know that a...that tablett

47:27.547 --> 47:30.799

Come back! Come back Shades!

47:46.242 --> 47:50.696
Jesus Christ, you are so fucking beautiful. Jesus Christ!

48:10.570 --> 48:14.501
Shades, listen to me. This is serious.
What's that...what was that?

48:14.877 --> 48:18.131
I want you to get out of the appartment.
I want you to get Jill right now, right fucking now!

48:18.280 --> 48:21.143
I want you to bring her back to your place
and lock the door untill I get there.

48:21.313 --> 48:24.292
Are you listening to me?
Just let me get my trousers on, okay?

48:25.184 --> 48:29.879
Shades, listen... I'm counting on you man.
I'm counting on you...okay?

48:29.909 --> 48:36.127
Everything...is under...control.

51:54.032 --> 51:55.626
Hi.

51:57.270 --> 51:58.899
No!

51:59.621 --> 52:02.376
It's okay.
Who are you?

52:03.053 --> 52:04.662
I'm a neighbour.

52:05.934 --> 52:07.040
What do you want?

52:07.054 --> 52:10.485
Lincon Weinberg Jr.
You can call me Lincon or Link.

52:11.265 --> 52:14.413
I just wanted to be sure you are alright.

52:16.611 --> 52:20.327
I'm fine!
Look, my boyfriend is asleep in the other room.

52:21.151 --> 52:22.771
Your boyfriend?

52:23.797 --> 52:29.872
So...I think you better go now!
I don't think to much of this boyfriend of yours.

52:30.587 --> 52:36.860
I don't see anything going on between you,
you know...nothing real, nothing permanent.

52:38.996 --> 52:42.248
It's really why I came here.
God, get back!

52:43.019 --> 52:44.888
Listen...I know alot about you.

52:45.413 --> 52:52.195
I know things about you, that you
probably don't even...admit.

52:53.117 --> 52:56.308
You always been my favorite subject.
Oh Jesus!

52:56.952 --> 53:01.829
Oh, wow! What was that?
There's a droid running crazy in my lounge.

53:05.003 --> 53:09.174
That's okay, we can go to my place.
Why wont this work?

53:09.949 --> 53:15.615
Someone's activated the emergency override,
you can only disengage from the main consol.

53:16.063 --> 53:18.808
How do you now?
I used to be with the surveillance company

53:19.057 --> 53:22.185
that installed all the locks and cameras
in this whole block a few years ago.

53:22.477 --> 53:27.088
That's how we know each other.
You made me a coffee while I was here.

53:28.174 --> 53:30.612
Black...two sugars?
I don't remember.

53:30.844 --> 53:36.249
It's okay. I don't mind.
Now what?

53:36.607 --> 53:39.182
Sounds like something is overloading
the main powerframe.

53:39.394 --> 53:44.621
Well, look Mr...Weinberg.
Lincon...you call me Link, please.

53:44.788 --> 53:49.094
Lincon. Can you get us out of here?
Where's the main terminal?

53:49.409 --> 53:54.274
It's in the living room, but you can't go in there.
That's okay. It's alright, I know what I'm doing.

53:54.806 --> 53:56.269
Come on, you can trust me.

54:03.761 --> 54:05.774
Keep talking, so I know where you are.

54:06.207 --> 54:07.922
I'm right here.

54:17.059 --> 54:18.766
Hello in there?!

54:20.236 --> 54:24.904
Man, I bet that android is anywhere...Ouch!
Hey?!

54:39.076 --> 54:40.726
Lincon?!

54:44.728 --> 54:48.724
Lincon?!
It's okay! I'm alright!

54:49.607 --> 54:51.296
There's nothing in here!

55:00.734 --> 55:03.703
What's his name?
Who's?

55:04.395 --> 55:09.608
Your boyfriends.
Moses.

55:09.826 --> 55:17.942
Moses? Jesus, some name.
He's not around very much, is he?

55:18.596 --> 55:21.200
You ought to get somebody closer to home.

55:21.867 --> 55:26.649
Somebody, kind of like...a neighbour..
Just fix the frickin' consol, okay!

55:46.015 --> 55:50.392
You smoke alot of dope.
I see you.

55:51.830 --> 55:55.823
Does it get your boyfirend hard or what?
I get people dope sometimes

55:56.030 --> 55:58.224
when they come around to my place
and it gets them hard.

55:58.612 --> 56:00.366
You can stop talking now.

56:05.084 --> 56:11.592
What if I sing? You want me to sing?
I don't really care, just get us out of here.

56:11.796 --> 56:13.415
Okay.

56:15.547 --> 56:20.681
Ooo we all walk the wibberly
wobberly walk...

56:20.922 --> 56:26.307
And we all talk the wibberly
wobberly talk.

56:26.382 --> 56:32.601
Ooo we all wear wibberly
wobberly ties...

56:32.796 --> 56:40.067
And we look at all the pretty girls
with wibberly wobberly eyes.

56:42.493 --> 56:44.045
I made that up.

56:44.052 --> 56:47.166
Look. I'm gonna make two things
very clear to you right now:

56:47.376 --> 56:52.372
One...there is no other way out of here, so
that means that droid is still in here somewhere.

56:52.624 --> 56:55.062
And two...
You just want me to leave.

56:56.007 --> 57:00.332
I just want you to open the door.
Why are you so afraid of me?

57:01.566 --> 57:03.130
I'm not afraid of you.

57:06.897 --> 57:10.932
Two...my boyfriend is in the corps.
He just got back from the zone.

57:11.812 --> 57:15.692
He just went out for a pack of cigarettes.
Any second he is going to walk through that door.

57:16.247 --> 57:20.394
And we don't want him to get the wrong idea!
Do we?!

57:22.295 --> 57:27.841
Check! Good thinking.
Okay, this should just about do it.

57:34.467 --> 57:36.063
So we can go?

57:36.481 --> 57:40.366
Er...wait...I'm just gonna...
What?

57:41.311 --> 57:43.584
Your blinds!
What about them?

57:44.272 --> 57:47.127
You closed them! I just wanna...

57:47.829 --> 57:52.187
Ooo we all walk the wibberley
wobberly walk...

57:52.501 --> 57:56.569
No I didn't.
And we all talk the wibberly...

57:57.697 --> 57:59.359
No I didn't. Don't!

57:59.962 --> 58:04.682
You don't wanna keep these closed. You won't
be able to see Santa Clause coming.

59:03.286 --> 59:04.914
Help me!

59:49.275 --> 59:55.202
Check...and mate.
Hey Chief! How'd you do that?

59:55.556 --> 59:57.128
I didn't even see that coming.

59:58.459 --> 01:00:03.697
Cecilia Momomba.
That's how you beat computers when you play.

01:00:04.981 --> 01:00:10.219
And she don't understand sacrifice and
neither do morons. Read!

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.655
Go away!

01:00:20.688 --> 01:00:22.780
Help me! God!

01:02:05.341 --> 01:02:09.841
Infrared. The bastard's using...infrared.

01:03:17.423 --> 01:03:19.272
Scream...scream...scream...

01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:50.442
Jill!

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.105
Jill, you in there?!

01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:12.722
Eat that! Motherfucker!

01:05:16.749 --> 01:05:17.385
Why?

01:05:17.588 --> 01:05:19.936
I don't know man. She wouldn't...
Get out of the way!

01:05:21.135 --> 01:05:22.719
Jill!

01:05:23.604 --> 01:05:25.226
Jill!

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.038
Jill, open the door!

01:05:31.326 --> 01:05:33.077
Open the door Jill!

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.472
Jill!

01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:14.004
We got him, okay! We got him!

01:08:29.934 --> 01:08:31.874
He's dead baby!

01:08:34.412 --> 01:08:37.859
He's dead!
I got him!

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:40.471
He's gone!

01:08:41.816 --> 01:08:43.386
Put that fire out over there!

01:08:43.705 --> 01:08:47.058
Come on man, turn the alarm off!
Come on, get on...come on, move along!

01:08:47.274 --> 01:08:50.089
Alright! Chief man, cool down.

01:08:51.386 --> 01:08:53.801
Why don't you just take chillpill man,
I'm getting rid of it.

01:08:54.004 --> 01:08:59.118
Stop messing around and put that fire out!
What are you doing? Move it! Come on, move it!

01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:09.694
Okay! I'm here, I'm here.
I'll take care of you, okay?

01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:11.795
Here we go.
I can do it!

01:09:12.044 --> 01:09:15.921
Let's just put this on.
Here we go. Here we go.

01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:20.981
This is...a serious...fuck up Max.

01:09:21.196 --> 01:09:23.665
Okay. Here we go.

01:09:25.198 --> 01:09:28.636
Vernon! Well come here boy!

01:09:32.426 --> 01:09:35.437
Who is the stiff?
I don't know.

01:09:36.475 --> 01:09:38.032
Never seen him before.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.075
Jeez, it's beautiful.

01:09:42.837 --> 01:09:44.890
Hope it didn't hit anybody.

01:09:47.522 --> 01:09:48.968
Hey Mo!

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.630
The fire is out! You wanna call
the cops and get an ambulance?

01:09:52.339 --> 01:09:55.098
I already had somebody call.
They should have been here by now!

01:09:55.471 --> 01:09:58.349
They are to fucking late,
it's all over!

01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:00.498
Calm down Jill.

01:10:00.515 --> 01:10:03.010
Over! It's to late Mo!
You're in shock Jill, you're in shock.

01:10:03.112 --> 01:10:07.566
To late! You fucking left me!
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

01:10:08.632 --> 01:10:11.446
But for how long?
From now on baby, okay?

01:10:12.136 --> 01:10:14.345
I'm gonna take care of you.
Everything is gonna be alright.

01:10:14.351 --> 01:10:17.483
I don't care about the money.
I'll get something together here.

01:10:17.674 --> 01:10:22.538
Maybe...maybe you and I should live in
New York. Just the three of us.

01:10:25.459 --> 01:10:27.960
Alright Shades. I'm looking
forward to that, okay?

01:10:27.987 --> 01:10:32.019
You never had to come back, did you?
All that bullshit about your contract!

01:10:32.505 --> 01:10:35.744
You just wanna be able to leave whenever you feel like it.
Na, na, you don't understand Jill.

01:10:35.745 --> 01:10:38.695
You don't understand.
Guys, I've got to go.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.955
Hell of a lie wasn't it?
No it wasn't a lie. It was...

01:10:45.146 --> 01:10:47.077
They threw me out Jill.

01:10:47.656 --> 01:10:51.030
They threw me out.
Doesn't matter...It's all a lie.

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.660
You're lying if you think that
thing's gonna kill the enemy.

01:10:54.766 --> 01:10:56.856
It don't care who it kills.

01:10:59.904 --> 01:11:02.840
The first usefull thing they ever given us.

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:07.135
What are you talking about Jill?
What are you talking about?

01:11:07.241 --> 01:11:12.700
That little bastard you just blew away.
That's their population control.

01:11:13.785 --> 01:11:17.500
Our final solution.
So what?

01:11:18.428 --> 01:11:20.089
Are you gonna let them win?
No.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.530
You gonna lay down and die?
I wanna live.

01:11:24.296 --> 01:11:26.219
Of course you wanna live.

01:11:41.621 --> 01:11:44.494
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:47.858 --> 01:11:50.352
Jill baby.
Help me!

01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:53.860
I can't baby! I can't!
Your hanging on a powerline.

01:11:53.861 --> 01:11:55.789
If I cut you, we'll both fry!

01:11:56.133 --> 01:11:57.574

01:11:57.598 --> 01:12:00.965

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:13.819
Just swing and drop. It's coming!
Help me!

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.876
You got to do it. Jill, it's coming.
Swing, for the love of christ.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:21.657

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:56.795
Piece of shit! You can't fuck with me!
You can't fuck with Mo!

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:02.631
I'm devined and protected asshole.

01:15:25.279 --> 01:15:27.520
"You can't fuck with me."

01:15:27.749 --> 01:15:31.112
"You...stay away from me."

01:15:32.087 --> 01:15:34.113
"You stay away from me."

01:15:53.384 --> 01:15:57.053
"You can kill him. Jill, you can kill him."

01:15:57.916 --> 01:16:01.404
"You can...you can."

01:17:09.846 --> 01:17:11.392
Let go.

01:17:12.376 --> 01:17:15.785
Get out of the way, get out of the way!
Give her some air, move!

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:26.569
Look who's alright. It's alright.
It's okay. Easy Jill.

01:17:29.413 --> 01:17:33.539
No, no Jill! Just lay down.
Where is Mo?

01:17:35.197 --> 01:17:38.783
"I...could have called somebody."

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:54.866
Just lay back Jill. Just lay back.
Everything is going to be okay.

01:17:57.983 --> 01:18:00.549
Jill! Jill!

01:18:00.863 --> 01:18:04.255
Jill...Look, be careful.
Just hang on Mo! I'm coming!

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:09.846
"I trained for what's right."

01:18:11.413 --> 01:18:18.255
"Jill baby. It has a metal defect.
There's a defect."

01:18:21.617 --> 01:18:25.351
"It's raining ??? salvation ???."

01:18:33.296 --> 01:18:36.082
"No! No! Light! Light!"

01:18:37.237 --> 01:18:40.555
"It's fight!...Light! Light!
Fight! Fight!"

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.205
The flesh shall be spared
for the elect.

01:18:55.296 --> 01:18:58.044
Who then shall see him coming,
the son of man.

01:18:58.079 --> 01:19:02.548
And he shall send his angels on a mission,
to gather together his flock.

01:19:08.374 --> 01:19:10.311
Did you hear something?

01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:21.457
I'm going away.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:30.132
Jill! Come back, come back Jill!

01:20:31.458 --> 01:20:33.882
Put the bat down Jill!

01:22:25.522 --> 01:22:27.096

01:22:30.267 --> 01:22:32.620

01:22:40.494 --> 01:22:42.040

01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:55.607

01:23:54.482 --> 01:23:56.113
"Hey baby."

01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:05.838
Can't we make a deal?
"A deal? You took a beating on that deal."

01:24:05.839 --> 01:24:08.695
I'm not the enemy. This isn't the zone.

01:24:08.905 --> 01:24:11.999
"She knows I got a job to do."
What Job? What's your mission?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.632
"I'm trying to tell you Jill.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:18.132
