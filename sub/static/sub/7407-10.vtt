15:40.902 --> 15:41.901
NOW THAT WE'VE INTERFERED--

15:41.903 --> 15:43.903
TROGAAR WILL STRIKE HARDER.

15:43.905 --> 15:45.404
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF--

15:45.406 --> 15:46.238
FOOLS!

15:46.240 --> 15:48.373
THE EARTH SCUM WERE WARNED.

15:48.375 --> 15:51.142
YOUR INSOLENCE WILL BE PUNISHED.

15:51.144 --> 15:55.446
YOUR CITY SHALL BE DESTROYED.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.556
GREAT.

16:19.202 --> 16:20.768
SO, AFTER TRASHING

16:20.770 --> 16:22.102
THE PIZZA PLACE AND

16:22.104 --> 16:23.736
A PERFECTLY GOOD VIDEO STORE,

16:23.738 --> 16:24.770
NOW WE'VE MANAGED TO MAKE

16:24.772 --> 16:26.204
A HUMONGOUS SPACE GECKO MAD

16:26.206 --> 16:27.238
ENOUGH TO VAPORIZE OUR

16:27.240 --> 16:28.872
ENTIRE TOWN?

16:28.874 --> 16:30.006
GO TEAM.

16:30.008 --> 16:31.073
ALL THE FAULT IS YOURS.

16:31.075 --> 16:32.240
I COMMANDED YOU LEAVE

16:32.242 --> 16:34.108
ME ALONE, BUT YOU INSISTED UPON

16:34.110 --> 16:36.110
THE BEING NICE.

16:36.112 --> 16:37.111
MY FAULT!

16:37.113 --> 16:38.946
YOU BLAST ME, YOU KISS ME,

16:38.948 --> 16:39.913
BUT YOU NEVER STOP TO MENTION

16:39.915 --> 16:41.114
THAT THEY HAVE A GIGANTIC

16:41.116 --> 16:42.548
PARTICLE WEAPON?

16:42.550 --> 16:43.782
WE ARE DOOMED.

16:43.784 --> 16:44.415
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET

16:44.417 --> 16:46.250
YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

16:46.252 --> 16:47.451
SAY WHAT?

16:47.453 --> 16:49.419
I WAS READY TO WALK BEFORE YOU--

16:49.421 --> 16:53.022
QUIET!

16:53.024 --> 16:54.356
HI.

16:54.358 --> 16:55.924
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER

16:55.926 --> 16:57.225
HOW WE GOT INTO THIS MESS.

16:57.227 --> 16:58.459
WE'RE IN IT, AND WE WILL

16:58.461 --> 17:00.527
GET OUT OF IT, TOGETHER.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.031
COME ON, WE'VE GOT A CITY

17:06.033 --> 17:07.599
TO SAVE.

17:21.213 --> 17:22.579
UHH...

17:22.581 --> 17:23.646
THAT DARK ENERGY STUFF

17:23.648 --> 17:25.247
GIVES ME THE...

17:25.249 --> 17:25.947
UHH...

17:25.949 --> 17:29.717
I MEAN, IT'S COOL.

17:29.719 --> 17:30.718
WE HAVE TO GET

17:30.720 --> 17:31.952
TO THE FIRING CONTROLS.

17:31.954 --> 17:33.453
THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME.

17:41.896 --> 17:43.228
MIND TELLING ME WHY

17:43.230 --> 17:45.396
YOU'RE ALWAYS BY YOURSELF?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.630
YOU HEARD THE KID.

17:46.632 --> 17:49.333
I DON'T EXACTLY FIT IN.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.500
HE'S GREEN, HALF OF ME

17:50.502 --> 17:52.869
IS METAL, AND SHE'S FROM SPACE.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.770
YOU FIT IN JUST FINE.

17:58.942 --> 18:02.109
I BRING YOU...APOLOGY.

18:02.111 --> 18:03.577
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:03.579 --> 18:05.011
I'M SORRY I YELLED, TOO.

18:05.013 --> 18:08.747
AND AGAIN, YOU ARE NICE.

18:08.749 --> 18:10.281
ON MY WORLD, ONLY MY CANORFKA

18:10.283 --> 18:13.050
HAS SHOWN ME SUCH KINDNESS.

18:13.052 --> 18:14.117
WELL, THINGS ARE

18:14.119 --> 18:15.584
DIFFERENT HERE.

18:17.921 --> 18:19.287
UH, GUYS?

18:19.289 --> 18:21.155
I THINK THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE.

18:29.298 --> 18:31.197
LORD TROGAAR, THE WEAPON

18:31.199 --> 18:34.266
HAS REACHED FULL POWER.

18:34.268 --> 18:35.767
THEN BEGIN THE FIRING

18:35.769 --> 18:37.201
SEQUENCE.

18:42.407 --> 18:44.607
THE EARTH SCUM SHALL LEARN.

18:44.609 --> 18:45.374
IT TAKES MORE THAN

18:45.376 --> 18:47.976
5 JUVENILE HEROES TO DEFY

18:47.978 --> 18:50.778
THE MIGHTY LORD TROGAAR.

18:59.655 --> 19:01.054
WE'RE NOT 5 HEROES,

19:01.056 --> 19:02.789
WE'RE ONE TEAM.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.690
[ROAR]

19:17.471 --> 19:18.403
H!

19:18.405 --> 19:19.570
OH!

19:19.572 --> 19:20.804
AAH!

19:22.741 --> 19:24.640
AAH!

19:24.642 --> 19:26.575
UHH!

19:26.577 --> 19:27.809
AHH!

19:42.925 --> 19:43.690
[GP]

19:43.692 --> 19:44.624
ROBIN!

19:44.626 --> 19:47.226
[GROWLING]

19:55.969 --> 19:57.201
UHH!

20:18.991 --> 20:19.889
CAN YOU REWIRE THAT

20:19.891 --> 20:21.724
INTO SOME SORT OF WEAPON?

20:21.726 --> 20:23.358
I CAN TRY.

20:26.129 --> 20:29.029
GET AWAY FROM MY FRIENDS.

20:29.031 --> 20:32.265
ASARA METRION ZINTOS!

20:51.652 --> 20:55.220
OHH!

20:55.222 --> 20:56.354
ALL RIGHT, I'M ONLY GOING

20:56.356 --> 20:57.822
TO SAY THIS ONCE.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.657
BOO YA!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.365
THAT'S QUITE A VIEW.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.199
SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BUILD

21:10.201 --> 21:11.266
A HOUSE OUT HERE.

21:11.268 --> 21:13.668
YEAH, IF YOU LIKE SUNSHINE

21:13.670 --> 21:16.604
AND THE BEACH.

21:16.606 --> 21:17.271
YOU KNOW,

21:17.273 --> 21:18.739
YOU'RE KIND OF FUNNY.

21:18.741 --> 21:20.707
YOU THINK I'M FUNNY?

21:20.709 --> 21:21.741
OH!

21:21.743 --> 21:23.909
DUDE, I KNOW SOME JOKES.

21:28.515 --> 21:30.181
PLEASE.

21:30.183 --> 21:34.518
I LOOK...NICE.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.020
I STILL DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME.

21:37.022 --> 21:37.920
IN YOUR LANGUAGE,

21:37.922 --> 21:41.523
IT WOULD BE STARFIRE.

21:41.525 --> 21:44.092
WELCOME TO EARTH, STARFIRE.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.359
I THANK YOU ALL FOR

21:45.361 --> 21:47.527
YOUR BRAVERY AND HELP,

21:47.529 --> 21:49.562
AND I WISH TO ASK PERMISSION

21:49.564 --> 21:52.798
TO REMAIN HERE WHERE THE PEOPLE

21:52.800 --> 21:54.432
ARE MOST STRANGE...

21:54.434 --> 21:58.969
BUT ALSO MOST KIND.

21:58.971 --> 21:59.703
YOU DON'T NEED

21:59.705 --> 22:00.904
OUR PERMISSION.

22:00.906 --> 22:01.804
BUT IF YOU WANT OUR

22:01.806 --> 22:03.539
FRIENDSHIP, YOU'VE GOT IT.

22:03.541 --> 22:04.406
I GUESS WE COULD ALL USE

22:04.408 --> 22:05.540
SOME NEW FRIENDS.

22:05.542 --> 22:06.707
BESIDES, WE KIND OF MADE

22:06.709 --> 22:08.108
A GOOD TEAM.

22:08.110 --> 22:09.042
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT WANT

22:09.044 --> 22:10.376
TO KEEP IN TOUCH.

22:10.378 --> 22:14.479
SO CYBORG AND I DESIGNED THESE.

22:14.481 --> 22:15.279
MADE THEM OUT OF MY OWN

22:15.281 --> 22:16.446
CIRCUITS.

22:16.448 --> 22:17.547
WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE,

22:17.549 --> 22:19.448
YOU KNOW WHO TO CALL.

22:35.465 --> 22:38.466
