00:29.772 --> 00:31.732
When I look back on it,

00:31.774 --> 00:34.985
I still can't make sense
of how a normal kid like me

00:35.027 --> 00:37.821
Ever wound up meeting
Buck Howard.

00:37.864 --> 00:39.656
When I was five years old,

00:39.699 --> 00:41.074
My dad asked me what
I wanted to be

00:41.117 --> 00:43.285
When I grew up.

00:43.327 --> 00:46.663
I said I wanted to drive
a steamroller and he said, "No,

00:46.706 --> 00:48.290
You want to be a lawyer."

00:48.332 --> 00:50.917
I said astronaut.
He said lawyer.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.211
I said policeman.
He said lawyer.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.381
So we compromised... on lawyer,

00:56.424 --> 00:57.924
Which is how, 20 years later,

00:57.967 --> 01:00.093
I ended up in law school.

01:00.136 --> 01:02.095
And even though
this was my father's dream,

01:02.138 --> 01:03.597
For the first couple of years

01:03.639 --> 01:05.140
I bought into the whole thing,

01:06.726 --> 01:08.518
Until one day.

01:08.561 --> 01:11.855
I finished an exam early
and I just sat there thinking,

01:11.898 --> 01:15.650
Thinking that somewhere
there must be somebody

01:15.693 --> 01:18.320
Whose dream it is to be a lawyer,

01:18.362 --> 01:20.530
But after more than
two years in law school,

01:20.573 --> 01:22.866
I hadn't met a single one.

01:22.909 --> 01:26.161
And suddenly it occurred to me...

01:26.204 --> 01:27.746
I'm not happy.

01:27.789 --> 01:29.539
I gotta get out of here.

01:29.582 --> 01:31.208
So this moment right here

01:31.250 --> 01:33.251
Became my last chance
to stop everything,

01:33.294 --> 01:35.086
Hit pause,

01:35.129 --> 01:37.088
And find a dream
before it was too late.

01:37.131 --> 01:41.092
Late or not, it felt fantastic.

01:41.135 --> 01:44.179
Of course, I hadn't told
my father any of this,

01:44.222 --> 01:45.889
But I was pretty sure
that he'd understand.

01:45.932 --> 01:48.308
I just had to present my case.

01:48.351 --> 01:51.770
Hey, Dad. Well, school's tough.

01:51.813 --> 01:55.982
You know,
Contracts is really hard.

01:56.025 --> 01:59.402
See? I would have been
a terrible lawyer.

01:59.445 --> 02:01.071
The thrilling thing, though,

02:01.113 --> 02:03.740
Is that now all I had were options.

02:03.783 --> 02:05.408
I could do anything I wanted.

02:05.451 --> 02:08.078
You name it,
I thought of being it.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.121
I could be a private investigator,

02:10.163 --> 02:12.207
A test driver for NASCAR,

02:12.250 --> 02:14.751
Or a talk show host.

02:14.794 --> 02:17.045
How do you get
that job, anyway?

02:17.088 --> 02:19.798
The truth, though,
is that I did have an idea

02:19.841 --> 02:22.050
In the back of my head.

02:22.093 --> 02:25.428
I had always had this secret dream
of becoming a writer.

02:25.471 --> 02:28.098
And while I didn't know
how to get that job either,

02:28.140 --> 02:30.809
I did have a pen and paper.

02:30.852 --> 02:33.228
So I just did what came naturally.

02:33.271 --> 02:35.313
And that's when I was hit
by something else...

02:35.356 --> 02:39.317
Reality... the reality of having to
find something to do

02:39.360 --> 02:41.528
To pay for little things
like food and rent,

02:41.571 --> 02:44.447
And getting my car fixed.
I had to find a job,

02:44.490 --> 02:47.075
But who said it couldn't be
something with a little adventure,

02:47.118 --> 02:50.495
Something with words like "celebrity"
and "performer" attached to it?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.042
And that's how it happened.

02:56.085 --> 02:58.545
That's how I found myself

02:58.588 --> 03:01.840
Meeting the one and only
Great Buck Howard.

03:10.975 --> 03:12.475
You must be Troy.

03:12.518 --> 03:15.103
- I'm Gil.
- Oh, hi. I'm Troy.

03:15.146 --> 03:17.814
- Sorry I'm late.
- Relax. It's not a problem.

03:17.857 --> 03:19.441
Let's grab a seat.

03:20.943 --> 03:22.652
He should be here any minute.

03:22.695 --> 03:24.613
We were impressed
you'd been to law school.

03:24.655 --> 03:27.824
I should probably explain that. Uh...

03:27.867 --> 03:29.826
I didn't finish, actually.

03:29.869 --> 03:31.286
Good evening, Mr. Howard.

03:31.329 --> 03:32.662
Oh, here he is.

03:38.711 --> 03:40.754
Buck!

03:40.796 --> 03:42.881
Big Buck!

04:08.574 --> 04:10.075
I'm Buck Howard.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.204
Troy Gable.

04:14.246 --> 04:18.083
Young man, I am delighted
that you are interested in this job.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.709
I am very busy. I did over...

04:20.753 --> 04:22.545
One thought kept racing
through my mind as Buck talked...

04:22.588 --> 04:26.549
I had no idea who this guy was...

04:26.592 --> 04:28.551
And I guess it must have shown.

04:28.594 --> 04:31.096
You do know who I am, don't you?

04:31.138 --> 04:32.931
Uh...

04:32.974 --> 04:34.432
You have seen "The Tonight Show"?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.352
You have to say "with Johnny Carson,"

04:37.395 --> 04:39.938
Not the nitwit who's on there now.

04:39.981 --> 04:41.731
Buck did "The Tonight Show"...
with Johnny...

04:41.774 --> 04:43.733
61 times.

04:43.776 --> 04:47.404
I think...
you're a magician, right?

04:47.446 --> 04:49.072
Buck's a mentalist.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.907
Magician is kind of
a dirty word around here.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.451
I was a magician...
when I was three years old,

04:53.494 --> 04:57.163
But I evolved out of that. Not that
I have anything against magicians,

04:57.206 --> 04:59.124
As long as they're dead.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.585
Buck's been
on all the big shows...

05:02.628 --> 05:06.506
Jim Nabors, Jon Davidson,
Sally Jesse Raphael.

05:06.549 --> 05:08.925
Dinah... he was the co-Host
on "Dinah!" Many times.

05:08.968 --> 05:11.302
He's performed all over the world...
Las Vegas...

05:11.345 --> 05:13.346
But not lately.

05:15.391 --> 05:18.601
Yourjob would be
to take care of all of Buck's travel,

05:18.644 --> 05:20.270
And then to go
on the road with him

05:20.312 --> 05:22.939
To ensure the engagements
were handled smoothly.

05:22.982 --> 05:26.568
It is a very demanding
but ultimately rewarding job.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.486
For instance,
in a few months' time

05:28.529 --> 05:30.947
We'd be very hard at work
on a benefit that I started

05:30.990 --> 05:33.575
For sick children
with my friend George Takei,

05:33.617 --> 05:36.953
Who is perhaps best known
for his portrayal of Sulu

05:36.996 --> 05:39.956
On "Star Trek."
He is a dear friend.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.958
This certainly wasn't the kind ofjob

05:42.001 --> 05:43.710
My father would
have envisioned for me,

05:43.753 --> 05:46.588
But there was something
kind of exciting about Buck.

05:46.630 --> 05:50.133
He told these long stories about
a world full of his famous friends...

05:50.176 --> 05:52.469
Johnny Carson, Ed McMahon...

05:52.511 --> 05:54.387
The Captain & Tennille.

05:55.806 --> 05:57.974
It was wonderful
to meet you, young man.

05:58.017 --> 05:59.976
I think this can all work out.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.770
Gil, call me later.

06:01.812 --> 06:03.772
So the job's yours if you want it...

06:03.814 --> 06:05.148
Pays $650 a week to start.

06:05.191 --> 06:07.150
Uh...

06:10.654 --> 06:12.822
Yeah, it sounds great.

06:12.865 --> 06:14.449
Good. You'll be going to
Bakersfield this weekend,

06:14.492 --> 06:16.076
Somebody will meet you
and show you the ropes.

06:16.118 --> 06:17.118
Good luck, Troy.

06:17.161 --> 06:18.953
Thank you, Gil.

06:21.373 --> 06:24.000
Edward, your younger readers
may not be aware

06:24.043 --> 06:28.004
That it was actually Johnny Carson
who dubbed me the Great Buck Howard.

06:28.047 --> 06:30.507
Do you recall what trick
you did that night?

06:30.549 --> 06:32.550
It's not a trick. It's an effect.

06:32.593 --> 06:36.346
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
there was a difference.

06:36.388 --> 06:38.890
Troy.

06:38.933 --> 06:41.351
Edward, I'm going
to give you a coin.

06:41.393 --> 06:45.063
I would like you to grasp it
between your thumb and your forefinger.

06:45.106 --> 06:49.692
I'm going to count, and whenever
you feel compelled to do so,

06:49.735 --> 06:51.694
You simply drop the coin.
Do you understand?

06:51.737 --> 06:55.156
Ready? One, two,

06:55.199 --> 06:58.201
Three.

06:58.244 --> 07:02.247
Troy, could you show Edward
what's written on that piece of paper?

07:08.379 --> 07:11.047
Welcome to Bakersfield!
I'm Sheila Heller.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.049
I'm Buck Howard.

07:14.593 --> 07:17.011
This is Alan, Troy...
and this is Edward.

07:17.054 --> 07:19.722
He is a magazine writer
who is doing a profile on me.

07:19.765 --> 07:21.391
- Oh, yeah.
- It's going to be a cover story, right?

07:21.433 --> 07:24.060
- Right.
- Buck needs to head back to the hotel

07:24.103 --> 07:25.562
To prepare for the performance,

07:25.604 --> 07:27.897
But if you could show
Troy and I around...

07:27.940 --> 07:30.275
Oh, that would be no problem at all.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.277
I love to come to the venue first

07:32.319 --> 07:34.195
And meet the people like you

07:34.238 --> 07:37.657
Who keep these places up
and running. Cha-Cha-Cha.

07:41.745 --> 07:45.331
Dude, check it out.
I like that... nice and big, bro.

07:49.795 --> 07:53.256
Right through here is where we have
the main celebrity dressing room,

07:53.299 --> 07:55.258
Which of course is for Buck.

07:55.301 --> 07:58.261
- And we have snacks.
- Where's the brandy?

07:59.805 --> 08:01.723
Oh! God, I knew
we forgot something.

08:01.765 --> 08:03.391
I'm so sorry.

08:03.434 --> 08:04.934
- I'll send out for a bottle right away.
- Okay.

08:04.977 --> 08:06.686
Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.522
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

08:09.565 --> 08:12.483
Okay. All right.

08:14.653 --> 08:16.279
Oh my God.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.284
Ah, but it's part of my job.

08:21.327 --> 08:22.619
You know what I'm saying?

08:24.830 --> 08:26.831
There aren't many cues,
but don't let that lull you to sleep.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.208
Do you have that intro?

08:42.681 --> 08:45.600
Please tell Buck I am
so sorry about the crowd.

08:45.643 --> 08:47.518
I thought it would
at least be half full.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.313
Go tell Buck he's on,

08:50.356 --> 08:53.024
And if he asks,
tell him it's a huge crowd.

08:57.363 --> 08:58.821
So...

09:05.287 --> 09:06.663
Come in.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.501
- How's the crowd?
- Uh, it's pretty full.

09:11.543 --> 09:13.461
Pretty full?
What does that mean?

09:13.504 --> 09:16.297
Nothing. It's a big crowd.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.841
- It's a packed house.
- Great! Let's do it.

09:20.052 --> 09:23.012
Uh, Buck, this way.

09:23.055 --> 09:25.598
Let's do it!

09:32.398 --> 09:33.856
Are you ready?

09:33.899 --> 09:35.650
Yes, of course
I'm ready. Let's go.

09:35.693 --> 09:37.986
He's ready. House lights down,
stage lights down, cue tape.

09:38.028 --> 09:41.030
...search in sullen silence
on a dull dark dock...

09:41.073 --> 09:45.326
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to introduce to you a man

09:45.369 --> 09:47.704
Who has performed in over 27 countries

09:47.746 --> 09:50.331
On radio, television,
and other media,

09:50.374 --> 09:53.042
Including "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson."

09:53.085 --> 09:55.378
- Presenting the Great Buck Howard!
- Spotlight.

10:01.552 --> 10:03.886
Whoa! There we go!

10:03.929 --> 10:06.723
Stupid amateurs.

10:06.765 --> 10:09.350
I love this town.

10:09.393 --> 10:13.271
All right. Next cue's in 15 minutes
when he goes over to the piano.

10:13.314 --> 10:16.107
I'll be outside.

10:16.150 --> 10:19.736
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I will need a volunteer.

10:19.778 --> 10:21.738
In fact, these two handsome,

10:21.780 --> 10:24.365
Strapping young lads
down in front will do perfectly...

10:24.408 --> 10:27.744
Here's the thing
that struck me about Buck

10:27.786 --> 10:29.704
As I watched
the progression of his show:

10:29.747 --> 10:32.749
He was cheesy...
there was no denying that...

10:32.791 --> 10:35.793
But he also had
a sort of timeless charm

10:35.836 --> 10:37.795
That the audience
really seemed to love.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.006
Uh-Oh.

10:40.049 --> 10:42.842
Uh-Oh.

10:42.885 --> 10:47.764
Now, I asked you to choose
a number between one and 100.

10:47.806 --> 10:49.599
But you didn't, did you?

10:49.641 --> 10:52.727
I guess I didn't.

10:52.770 --> 10:57.482
Did you choose the number zero?

10:57.524 --> 10:59.400
Whoa.

10:59.443 --> 11:01.778
- Whoa, zero.
- God...

11:01.820 --> 11:04.822
Zero.

11:06.492 --> 11:10.703
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

11:10.746 --> 11:13.289
...deep and profound sleep.

11:13.332 --> 11:16.584
Nighty-Night.

11:16.627 --> 11:20.463
What the world needs now

11:20.506 --> 11:24.467
Is love, sweet love...

11:24.510 --> 11:27.387
Now I'll need to impose
on you one last time

11:27.429 --> 11:29.013
Before I vanish.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.058
I will need four volunteers,
two of whom

11:32.101 --> 11:34.102
Will go with me
to the green room.

11:34.144 --> 11:37.188
The other two will stay
here in the auditorium...

11:37.231 --> 11:38.773
Hey.

11:38.816 --> 11:43.069
...and they will take
my entire fee in cash

11:43.112 --> 11:46.656
And they will hide
that fee in here.

11:46.698 --> 11:51.869
If I am unable to find
that cash when I return,

11:51.912 --> 11:56.124
That money will stay here
in Bakersfield, California.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.792
I love this town!

11:57.835 --> 12:01.587
I saw him do this
last week in Stockton.

12:01.630 --> 12:04.590
Apparently he's never
failed to find his money

12:04.633 --> 12:07.260
In over 5,000 tries.

12:07.302 --> 12:08.886
Hmm.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.931
I'll let you choose
your four volunteers.

12:13.684 --> 12:16.769
Guys, come on.
We have to go to the green room.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.735
Gentlemen, this is
my entire entourage,

12:24.778 --> 12:28.614
Just so you can see there's
absolutely nothing fishy going on

12:28.657 --> 12:30.241
While they hide my money.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.034
You'll be my witnesses.

12:32.077 --> 12:35.037
Would either of you like
a signed photograph?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.622
- Oh...
- Yeah.

12:36.665 --> 12:40.710
Alan, some signed photos,
colored ones, please.

12:40.752 --> 12:42.920
I don't see
any of the colored ones.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.923
Seek and ye shall find, Alan.
They're in there.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.134
My ink pen, please. Ink pen.

12:50.596 --> 12:52.555
- Thank you, Troy.
- Black and white's fine.

12:52.598 --> 12:54.557
No, it's not. It's not fine.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.268
- Alan?
- Buck, these are the only ones we have.

12:59.271 --> 13:01.731
Mr. Howard,
they're ready for you.

13:01.773 --> 13:03.774
Oh, well that's fantastic news.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.776
Sorry, folks,
there won't be any photograph

13:05.819 --> 13:07.570
Due to Alan's incompetence.

13:07.613 --> 13:09.280
I'd still like a black and white.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.949
What's the point in having
a black and white?

13:11.992 --> 13:13.910
What's the point?

13:13.952 --> 13:15.453
Let's go.

13:18.916 --> 13:21.417
- Thanks a lot.
- I'm sorry.

13:56.411 --> 13:59.330
Sir, may I look
in your right shoe, please?

14:12.052 --> 14:15.721
Oh, well.
I thought it would be more.

14:18.016 --> 14:19.850
How did he do that?

14:19.893 --> 14:22.019
I love this town!

14:25.941 --> 14:28.526
- ...In front of these people.
- The only humiliation is

14:28.569 --> 14:30.611
- That you're incompetent.
- That's not true!

14:30.654 --> 14:33.447
- It is true.
- Come out and say that to my face!

14:33.490 --> 14:35.449
Go on, get the hell out of here.

14:35.492 --> 14:37.451
Leave the petty cash with Troy.

14:37.494 --> 14:39.245
- That's my money.
- Oh yeah, Buck?

14:39.288 --> 14:40.955
Well, you suck!

14:43.417 --> 14:46.043
I can't train you anymore. You're gonna
have to figure it out for yourself.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.212
I don't even know where to begin.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.840
It's not that complicated. Listen,

14:50.882 --> 14:52.842
If you take this job,
you're an idiot.

14:52.884 --> 14:54.427
Do you underst...

14:54.469 --> 14:57.179
Troy, I'm sorry
you had to see this.

14:57.222 --> 15:00.224
Edward, this wouldn't be
a pleasant story.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.059
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to write that down.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.061
Alan, I think it's time
for you to leave.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.689
- No, okay...
- Otherwise, I'm gonna call security.

15:06.732 --> 15:09.108
Oh, call security, you fossil!

15:16.658 --> 15:19.994
Well, I guess this
is adios, fellas.

15:25.626 --> 15:29.503
Excuse me for interrupting.
Could I have your autograph?

15:29.546 --> 15:32.923
Anything for a beautiful young lady.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.592
Oh!

15:36.928 --> 15:39.597
Did you enjoy the show?

15:39.640 --> 15:43.059
Oh, I didn't see the show. In fact,
I didn't even know you were here.

15:43.101 --> 15:45.603
There was nothing about it
in the paper or anything.

15:45.646 --> 15:49.982
I used to watch you all the time
on the Carson show, though.

15:50.025 --> 15:51.692
That's super.

15:51.735 --> 15:53.569
There you go.

15:53.612 --> 15:54.779
Thank you.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.993
Something's bothering you, it seems.

16:03.914 --> 16:05.915
That whole thing with Alan...

16:05.957 --> 16:08.250
Alan and I have been
having problems for years.

16:08.293 --> 16:09.919
That's why I had to let him go.

16:09.961 --> 16:14.799
Troy, I know you have
aspirations beyond this job.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.885
Well, no matter what you decide
to do in the future,

16:17.928 --> 16:20.304
You'll need life experience.
I can give you that.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.974
Some very big things
are about to happen for me.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.810
What kind of things?

16:25.852 --> 16:29.146
Well, Troy, why don't you
stick around a while,

16:29.189 --> 16:31.482
Work with me?
Maybe you'll find out.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.819
Deal?

16:41.910 --> 16:43.703
I dove in.

16:43.745 --> 16:46.580
My life became
all Buck Howard all the time.

16:46.623 --> 16:48.791
The auditoriums
we played in were old

16:48.834 --> 16:51.836
And usually half full
but Buck didn't seem to notice.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.505
The minute he came out on stage,
he was in his element.

16:54.548 --> 16:57.341
Buck walked the edge.
Everything he did,

16:57.384 --> 16:59.343
He made the impossible
seem possible.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.846
Isn't that wild?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.848
It's wild!

17:03.890 --> 17:06.474
Buck did have his following,

17:06.518 --> 17:09.145
- And we went to them.
- I love this town!

17:09.186 --> 17:13.190
For some reason, the people
of Akron, Ohio went nuts for him.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.192
I saw parts of the country
I'd never seen before...

17:15.234 --> 17:18.362
- Welcome to Willamette, Oregon!
- I love this town!

17:18.405 --> 17:20.948
That I'd never heard of before...

17:20.991 --> 17:22.742
Welcome to Wausau, Wisconsin!

17:22.784 --> 17:24.492
I love this town!

17:24.536 --> 17:26.494
Buck did have his quirks.

17:26.538 --> 17:28.998
How much did you
tip the bellman?

17:29.040 --> 17:30.499
$2.00.

17:30.542 --> 17:32.376
That's it?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.336
You represent me, Troy.

17:34.379 --> 17:36.672
You're making me look cheap.

17:36.715 --> 17:38.966
Here you go. Thanks.

17:39.009 --> 17:41.135
Troy, can you come in here?

17:41.178 --> 17:44.305
Did you just give
the bellman $10.00?

17:44.347 --> 17:46.432
- Yes, why?
- It's far too much.

17:46.475 --> 17:49.059
$1.00 cash, American, per bag.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.227
I am not made of money.

17:53.565 --> 17:57.026
And sometimes
he went beyond quirky.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.528
They pick me up in a minivan.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.405
This show is already ruined!

18:01.448 --> 18:03.616
You are incompetent!

18:03.658 --> 18:06.702
Yeah, Buck could
be difficult, frustrating,

18:06.745 --> 18:09.955
And at times I had to wonder
why I put up with it all.

18:09.998 --> 18:12.208
Mr. Howard.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.502
I want to thank you
so much for having me.

18:14.544 --> 18:16.504
I just wanted to say,
though, I won't be doing

18:16.546 --> 18:18.214
The "You can call me RayJay" bit.

18:18.256 --> 18:19.632
I don't want to do that.

18:19.674 --> 18:22.426
And by the way,
is Mr. Takei here?

18:22.469 --> 18:26.514
Um, no, he's uh...
he won't be with us this year.

18:26.556 --> 18:28.390
My college roommate was managing

18:28.433 --> 18:29.892
A multimillion dollar hedge fund

18:29.935 --> 18:31.894
And here I was helping Buck Howard

18:31.937 --> 18:33.562
With his benefit
starring Gary Coleman

18:33.605 --> 18:35.397
And the guy from
the "Police Academy" movies.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.401
The strange thing
was that I didn't mind.

18:39.444 --> 18:41.570
- Hello, Buck Howard.
- It was kind of cool.

18:41.613 --> 18:43.948
Or sad, depending on how
you looked at it.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.741
You gotta tell me
how you do it.

18:45.784 --> 18:48.828
I keep getting older
and you look the same.

18:48.870 --> 18:51.038
- Clean living.
- Yeah, clean living,

18:51.081 --> 18:53.040
And keeping all your money
under a mattress, right?

18:53.083 --> 18:56.544
Anyhow, Buck, I want
to really thank you for calling me.

18:56.586 --> 19:00.923
You know,
nobody calls me anymore.

19:00.966 --> 19:03.592
Buck, we're ready to start.

19:04.803 --> 19:06.804
Have a great show, everyone.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.689
I would like to dedicate
this next song

19:16.731 --> 19:20.109
To a once very very
dear friend of mine,

19:21.736 --> 19:25.322
Sulu, from "the Star Trek,"

19:25.365 --> 19:27.324
Mr. George Takei.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.411
George,

19:31.997 --> 19:33.956
May the force be in you.

19:36.334 --> 19:40.170
What the world needs now...

19:40.213 --> 19:42.715
No matter
how corny Buck's show could be,

19:42.757 --> 19:45.175
And no matter how much
he yelled at me before it,

19:45.218 --> 19:47.177
I never missed
the money effect.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.055
It was the one part of the show
that always amazed me.

19:50.098 --> 19:52.850
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.980
Ladies and gentlemen,
my money.

19:58.023 --> 20:01.984
And without fail,
it always amazed the audience.

20:02.027 --> 20:04.278
True, it would be a pleasure
to retrieve it personally.

20:04.321 --> 20:08.824
As a gentlemen,
I fear I must refrain,

20:08.867 --> 20:11.994
For my money
is in your brassiere.

20:14.539 --> 20:19.168
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's the money!

20:19.210 --> 20:21.170
I hadn't found my place in the world.

20:21.212 --> 20:24.006
But this finale was Buck's place,

20:24.049 --> 20:26.008
And just getting to be a part of it

20:26.051 --> 20:29.637
Made me feel like
I was on the right track.

20:29.679 --> 20:33.474
Troy, we have the last
of the Great Buck autograph seekers.

20:33.516 --> 20:38.437
A colored photograph.
To whom shall I address it?

20:38.480 --> 20:40.230
Dad, what are you doing here?

20:40.273 --> 20:43.567
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.364
- Uh...
- Troy, this is your father?

20:48.406 --> 20:51.116
I didn't know
you had family in Leesburg.

20:51.159 --> 20:53.327
He doesn't.

20:53.370 --> 20:56.455
Sir, what a pleasure.

20:56.498 --> 20:58.415
I'm Buck Howard.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.460
But before
you congratulate me on the show

21:01.503 --> 21:03.212
I have to congratulate
you on something.

21:03.254 --> 21:06.173
I want you to know you have raised
a very fine young man

21:06.216 --> 21:08.258
Who is doing
a wonderful job for me.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.427
Hmm. I thought
he was in law school,

21:10.470 --> 21:12.680
Because that's what he told me.

21:12.722 --> 21:17.267
But I am thrilled to hear that
he's doing a wonderful job for you.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.400
Uh-Oh.

21:24.442 --> 21:28.529
You know, Mr. Gable,
I can imagine how you feel.

21:28.571 --> 21:31.281
My father didn't want me
to go into show business.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.075
He wanted me to be
an accountant.

21:33.118 --> 21:36.245
Obviously that wasn't my calling.

21:36.287 --> 21:38.914
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna touch that.

21:38.957 --> 21:43.377
But if carrying your bags
is Troy's calling, well then I just

21:43.420 --> 21:46.046
Wasted a lot of money
on his education.

21:46.089 --> 21:48.924
- Dad.
- Troy, may I?

21:48.967 --> 21:51.260
You know, sir,
I have a theory about that.

21:51.302 --> 21:54.596
I call it my onwards
and upwards theory.

21:54.639 --> 21:57.683
Perhaps you noticed
in the musical portion of my...

21:57.726 --> 22:00.477
Listen, I'd like to
talk to my son alone.

22:03.481 --> 22:05.441
Very well.
I was merely trying to add

22:05.483 --> 22:09.111
A little perspectivo,
as the Latins say.

22:09.154 --> 22:10.821
I think you've done that.

22:11.990 --> 22:15.034
Very well. Good evening.

22:15.076 --> 22:19.830
Troy, you can bring that and toss
my salad when you get back to the hotel.

22:23.626 --> 22:25.586
That's a hell of a guy.

22:25.628 --> 22:27.796
Dad, I'm sorry.

22:27.839 --> 22:31.008
I haven't heard from you
in over a month.

22:31.051 --> 22:34.511
I had to call your friends
like I was some kind of freaking cop.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.472
I know.

22:36.514 --> 22:39.475
I would have killed
to go to law school, Troy.

22:39.517 --> 22:41.268
I would have killed.

22:41.311 --> 22:43.604
I hated it.

22:43.646 --> 22:46.815
- I wasn't happy. I...
- You think I danced out the front door

22:46.858 --> 22:49.234
Every morning
in my adult life happy

22:49.277 --> 22:52.154
About where I was
gonna be spending my day?

22:52.197 --> 22:55.657
I don't know what
you're doing here.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.494
I don't think you do either.

22:58.536 --> 23:01.747
But come on.
You're smarter than this.

23:01.790 --> 23:03.665
You are.

23:03.708 --> 23:06.210
You are smarter than this.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.047
I hope he enjoys his Cobb salad.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.693
I just don't think, uh...

23:31.736 --> 23:35.030
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

23:35.073 --> 23:38.075
I'm sorry.
I have to resign.

23:39.953 --> 23:41.453
I have to resign.

23:41.496 --> 23:43.539
Gil's not here yet?

23:44.707 --> 23:46.416
Uh, no, he's not.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.710
Buck, there's something
I need to discuss with you.

23:48.753 --> 23:51.547
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

23:51.589 --> 23:54.716
Can we talk later?
We'll get back to this,

23:54.759 --> 23:57.469
But there is some business
I need to discuss.

23:57.512 --> 23:59.304
I've tried.

23:59.347 --> 24:01.974
I'm on the horn to the guys
at Leno, Letterman, every week.

24:02.016 --> 24:04.935
They want to have you on the show.
They're just booked tightly right now.

24:04.978 --> 24:07.896
Letterman I understand
because I don't have a history there.

24:07.939 --> 24:12.067
But this Jay Leno... I think
he's doing his show a great disservice

24:12.110 --> 24:15.237
By not having me. I practically built
"The Tonight Show."

24:15.280 --> 24:17.656
I know we need to get you
some attention right now.

24:17.699 --> 24:19.658
I speak to the bookers in Vegas.

24:19.701 --> 24:21.118
I tell them you're better now
than you've ever been.

24:21.161 --> 24:23.579
They tell me
they just need to see it.

24:23.621 --> 24:26.123
If they need to see something,

24:26.166 --> 24:28.417
I've got something
I can show them.

24:32.213 --> 24:36.425
For the past three years
I have been rehearsing in secret

24:36.467 --> 24:39.261
A new effect. I can't even tell
either of you what it is.

24:39.304 --> 24:42.556
It's not that I don't trust you,
but I cannot afford

24:42.599 --> 24:44.933
That the tabloids
get a hold of this now.

24:44.976 --> 24:49.313
Let me just say it is enormous.

24:49.355 --> 24:53.066
And I think Cincinnati is
the perfect place to unveil it.

24:53.109 --> 24:56.278
They have always
loved me in Ohio.

24:56.321 --> 25:00.324
Not so much Ohio,
but Akron.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.619
It's close to Cincinnat...
it's the same state.

25:03.661 --> 25:08.123
I need you to call Steve Keating
in New York at the top P.R. Firm.

25:08.166 --> 25:11.126
I want local press
and national press.

25:11.169 --> 25:14.796
I can feel this.
It's gonna be huge.

25:14.839 --> 25:16.840
Cincinnati.

25:25.642 --> 25:27.559
Welcome to Cincinnati!

25:27.602 --> 25:28.685
I love this town!

25:28.728 --> 25:30.562
- I'm Doreen.
- How do you do?

25:30.605 --> 25:32.022
I'm Buck Howard.

25:32.065 --> 25:34.107
This is my brother Kenny.

25:34.150 --> 25:36.568
- Hello, Kenny. How are you?
- Good.

25:36.611 --> 25:38.820
On behalf of both of us,

25:38.863 --> 25:42.199
And the Cincinnati chapter
of the Red Hat Society,

25:42.242 --> 25:47.246
I'd like to present you
with this pin.

25:49.499 --> 25:50.999
Well, my goodness.

25:51.042 --> 25:53.168
Isn't that beautiful?
Ow!

25:53.211 --> 25:55.712
- Oh!
- Agh! Mmm!

25:55.755 --> 25:57.839
You may have
drawn blood there.

25:57.882 --> 25:59.508
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

25:59.550 --> 26:01.551
It's a beautiful pin
from a beautiful woman

26:01.594 --> 26:03.470
And I will wear it
while I'm here.

26:03.513 --> 26:05.889
The entire time I'm here,
I'll wear it for good luck.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.725
Boy, I love to come
to these venues before the show,

26:08.768 --> 26:11.853
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
get back to the hotel

26:11.896 --> 26:14.523
Because my press relations attache

26:14.565 --> 26:18.360
Has flown in for a rendezvous
from the borough of Manhattan.

26:18.403 --> 26:20.529
That's no problem at all.
We're your hosts.

26:20.571 --> 26:24.533
We'll be taking you anywhere you need
to go the whole time you're here.

26:24.575 --> 26:26.535
That's how we do it
in Cincinnati.

26:26.577 --> 26:29.830
I'm gonna drive you.
We got a limo and everything.

26:33.793 --> 26:38.338
I saw you, 1989,
Bowling Green University.

26:38.381 --> 26:40.882
You were awesome!
Do you remember that?

26:40.925 --> 26:45.012
Honestly, I do
vaguely remember that.

26:45.054 --> 26:47.639
But of course that's
nearly 20 years ago,

26:47.682 --> 26:50.225
And I do 400 or so shows a year.

26:50.268 --> 26:52.728
You do 400 shows a year?

26:54.772 --> 26:57.607
Yeah, uh, I'm doing
the calculations in my head...

26:57.650 --> 26:59.609
You might want
to face that way.

26:59.652 --> 27:03.071
And I don't even see how 300 dates
is physically possible. I mean...

27:05.116 --> 27:07.492
That's pretty much
a show every night, you know?

27:07.535 --> 27:09.703
I mean, where do you perform
on Monday and Tuesday nights

27:09.746 --> 27:11.913
And how does that
allow for travel time?

27:11.956 --> 27:16.668
Troy, he has to be checked in
by now. It's Steve Keating. K-E-A.

27:16.711 --> 27:20.255
Buck, I know how to spell.
I told him his name a thousand times.

27:20.298 --> 27:22.257
They're saying
he hasn't checked in.

27:22.300 --> 27:25.927
Well, this is absurd.
I have to do the TV show this afternoon.

27:25.970 --> 27:28.555
I don't have
my press attaché,

27:28.598 --> 27:33.435
I'm forced to be driven around
by these two hayseeds all day long.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.731
Maybe that's him, Troy.
Get the door.

27:40.485 --> 27:42.444
Hello.

27:42.487 --> 27:44.613
Do I have the right room?
I'm looking for Buck Howard.

27:44.655 --> 27:47.157
Troy, can you hang up
my pants, please?

27:47.200 --> 27:49.284
How can I help you, miss?

27:49.327 --> 27:52.621
Mr. Howard, I'm Valerie Brennan
from K.P.T. Steve couldn't make it.

27:52.663 --> 27:56.375
There was this emergency
in London with Gary Oldman

27:56.417 --> 27:58.126
So I will be working with you.

27:58.169 --> 28:01.004
With you?
You're practically an embryo.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.465
I really don't take this very well.

28:03.508 --> 28:05.008
I'm sorry. I don't like
these kind of changes.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.302
I have a very big weekend.

28:07.345 --> 28:08.887
I have my show Saturday.

28:08.930 --> 28:10.889
I have an enormous event
planned for Sunday.

28:10.932 --> 28:13.225
And I know all about it.
I have been briefed.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.185
It's gonna be perfect.

28:15.228 --> 28:17.229
I know you hired Steve,

28:17.271 --> 28:20.440
But I think I can fill in
for him quite capably.

28:22.193 --> 28:24.778
All right, young lady,
we'll give it a shot, see how it goes.

28:24.821 --> 28:27.364
Good. My name's Valerie.

28:27.407 --> 28:30.450
Very well, Valerie.

28:30.493 --> 28:33.620
This is Troy,
my road manager.

28:33.663 --> 28:35.455
Hi.

28:35.498 --> 28:37.874
So why don't you get some rest?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.876
The news is
in a couple of hours

28:39.919 --> 28:41.461
And I need to work
on your schedule.

28:41.504 --> 28:44.548
If you could spare Troy,
that would be great.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.758
He could help me roll some calls.

28:46.801 --> 28:49.678
- Troy, do you mind?
- No.

28:51.222 --> 28:52.722
Well, it was nice meeting you.

28:56.144 --> 28:57.185
Thank you.

28:59.689 --> 29:04.234
From the shining se-Ee-Ea...

29:06.195 --> 29:08.905
So, you wanted to
go over something?

29:08.948 --> 29:12.951
Oh, no. I just want
to go over a drink about now.

29:12.994 --> 29:15.078
Can I have a scotch
on the rocks?

29:15.121 --> 29:17.038
- And you, sir?
- Uh, same.

29:17.081 --> 29:19.040
Very good.

29:19.083 --> 29:22.335
I can't believe I'm in Cincinnati
with Buck Howard.

29:25.089 --> 29:27.048
Can I ask you
something about Buck?

29:27.091 --> 29:29.050
- Yeah.
- Is he gay?

29:29.093 --> 29:31.261
'Cause we got a bet
going in the office.

29:31.304 --> 29:34.514
I don't know.

29:34.557 --> 29:37.476
So you're not his, um,

29:37.518 --> 29:38.894
Traveling companion, or...

29:38.936 --> 29:40.353
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

29:40.396 --> 29:42.314
It just looked
kind of domestic up in the room

29:42.356 --> 29:45.108
With you handling his pants.

29:45.151 --> 29:48.236
No, Buck's just my boss.

29:48.279 --> 29:51.364
I'm just doing this to pay the bills,

29:51.407 --> 29:55.035
You know, until I figure out...

29:55.077 --> 29:56.828
What you really want to do.

29:56.871 --> 29:58.580
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hmm.

29:58.623 --> 30:00.540
Okay, so, let me guess.

30:00.583 --> 30:04.669
You... you're a good looking guy,
so you're an actor.

30:04.712 --> 30:07.047
No.

30:08.257 --> 30:09.424
Stand up?

30:09.467 --> 30:11.593
Oh, God no.

30:11.636 --> 30:13.303
Okay, hold on, hold on.

30:13.346 --> 30:17.140
Um, you're a writer.

30:18.142 --> 30:19.643
- Did I get it?
- No.

30:19.685 --> 30:20.685
Yeah.

30:20.728 --> 30:23.355
I do a little writing.

30:23.397 --> 30:25.440
What little writing
have you done?

30:25.483 --> 30:28.610
Just little stuff, silly stuff,

30:28.653 --> 30:32.656
Stuff that's happened to me, or stuff
that didn't happen that I wish happened,

30:32.698 --> 30:34.241
Things like that.

30:34.283 --> 30:36.076
Well, you sound like
a writer to me.

30:36.118 --> 30:37.452
Hmm.

30:37.495 --> 30:38.995
Thank you.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.789
Hey, I didn't say
you were a good writer.

30:42.833 --> 30:44.793
Okay, I'm gonna go.

30:44.835 --> 30:46.586
This was fun. It was nice.

30:46.629 --> 30:50.715
So I'm gonna go freshen up
for our big night out.

30:50.758 --> 30:52.801
I'll see you at dinner.

31:01.269 --> 31:05.021
I can't believe that you know
Sulu from "Star Trek."

31:05.064 --> 31:08.775
Hey, what about Spock?
You know him too?

31:08.818 --> 31:12.153
I've met Leonard Nimoy
but I wouldn't say we're friends.

31:12.196 --> 31:14.364
And for that matter, George and I

31:14.407 --> 31:16.783
Aren't on the best of terms
at the moment, I'm afraid.

31:16.826 --> 31:19.327
Mr. Howard, have you
ever been married?

31:19.370 --> 31:21.871
No, I've never met
the right little lady.

31:21.914 --> 31:23.707
Yeah, right.

31:23.749 --> 31:27.544
As Shirley MacLaine said,
"True love is supposed to be rare.

31:27.587 --> 31:28.795
That's how we know
it's valuable."

31:28.838 --> 31:30.380
That's beautiful.

31:30.423 --> 31:32.173
Shirley's actually a client of ours.

31:32.216 --> 31:33.508
She is a very nice woman.

31:33.551 --> 31:35.760
You know Shirley MacLaine?

31:35.803 --> 31:38.888
That's what I do. I arrange and
coordinate publicity for celebrities.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.599
- Well, give us some dirt!
- No!

31:40.641 --> 31:42.726
We want to know
who's sleeping with who!

31:42.768 --> 31:45.270
- I take the fifth because...
- I know Shirley. She...

31:45.313 --> 31:47.564
- I cannot say anything complimentary.
- She came to a show I did.

31:47.607 --> 31:49.024
All right, tell us who's nice, then.

31:49.066 --> 31:52.152
Okay. Um, so,

31:52.194 --> 31:54.237
People like to make fun
of Keanu Reeves,

31:54.280 --> 31:56.239
Right, 'cause he's...

31:56.282 --> 31:58.658
But he is one of the sweetest
guys you will ever meet.

31:58.701 --> 32:00.702
Oh, you can tell that.

32:00.745 --> 32:02.829
Tell him he kicked butt
in "The Matrix"!

32:02.872 --> 32:04.456
- Tell him.
- Okay.

32:04.498 --> 32:06.291
Um, and, um, Jay Leno...

32:07.752 --> 32:09.502
He's just a regular guy
from Boston.

32:09.545 --> 32:12.714
Just really down to earth,
really sweet.

32:12.757 --> 32:14.549
You think Jay Leno is

32:14.592 --> 32:18.595
Just a regular sweet guy
from Boston?

32:18.638 --> 32:22.432
You don't have the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.561
Well, I met Jay Leno
a number of times

32:26.604 --> 32:28.855
And he's always
been really warm.

32:28.898 --> 32:30.398
Then he was faking.

32:30.441 --> 32:33.860
I know Jay Leno, missy.
I know him.

32:33.903 --> 32:35.695
I've dealt with Jay Leno.

32:35.738 --> 32:38.615
- You'll have to trust me on this one.
- I...

32:44.747 --> 32:46.790
Buck Howard?
To makeup.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.543
No, Buck. This way.

32:50.586 --> 32:52.045
Let's do it!

32:54.006 --> 32:57.008
I'll be right back. I have to go
call and check in on the boys.

32:58.386 --> 33:02.722
She's great, my sister.

33:02.765 --> 33:04.724
She's a genius,

33:04.767 --> 33:08.895
Very artistic, been married
a whole bunch of times.

33:08.938 --> 33:12.440
She's lived a glamorous life.

33:12.483 --> 33:14.609
Sounds like it.

33:17.154 --> 33:19.155
Hey.

33:20.658 --> 33:22.617
How does Buck do his tricks?

33:22.660 --> 33:25.120
I'm not gonna tell anyone, I swear.

33:25.162 --> 33:27.622
I don't know. I don't...

33:27.665 --> 33:30.792
You're his assistant.
He's got to tell you something.

33:30.835 --> 33:34.671
Kenny, as far as I know, it's real.

33:36.257 --> 33:37.966
Damn.

33:38.008 --> 33:40.385
They're gonna go to commercial
in a couple of minutes.

33:40.428 --> 33:42.053
Then we're on.

33:42.096 --> 33:45.056
The producer says
we can watch from the booth.

33:45.099 --> 33:46.808
Okay.

33:46.851 --> 33:50.270
You smell really nice.

33:52.857 --> 33:55.150
Thanks.

33:55.192 --> 33:57.152
Cindy Crown here,
back with magician Buck Howard,

33:57.194 --> 34:00.238
Or the Great Buck Howard
as he's more commonly known.

34:00.281 --> 34:03.408
It is wonderful to have you
in Cincinnati, Buck.

34:03.451 --> 34:06.828
Thanks, Cindy.
I'm very glad to be here.

34:06.871 --> 34:10.290
Yes, and I understand
you're here for a very special show.

34:10.331 --> 34:11.833
That's correct, Cindy.

34:11.876 --> 34:13.501
On Saturday evening,

34:13.543 --> 34:16.004
I will be performing

34:16.045 --> 34:18.922
At the Cincinnati Arts Complex.

34:18.966 --> 34:22.010
I was afraid Ohio
may have an arts complex,

34:22.052 --> 34:24.344
But I never expected
it would be in Cincinnati.

34:25.556 --> 34:27.223
And on Sunday afternoon,

34:27.266 --> 34:30.018
I'll be staging
a very important event.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.643
Why don't you tell us about that?

34:34.273 --> 34:37.358
This has been top secret
to this very moment.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.362
At roughly 2:00 P.M.,

34:41.405 --> 34:43.531
I will put to sleep

34:43.574 --> 34:45.533
900 souls,

34:45.576 --> 34:49.036
Whom I will wake up
immediately afterwards,

34:49.079 --> 34:51.998
As if from the dead.

34:52.041 --> 34:54.708
Well, that sounds just super.

34:54.752 --> 34:56.543
Be sure to come out
for both events, folks.

34:56.587 --> 34:59.130
Now, I've heard you're going
to do a warmup

34:59.173 --> 35:01.341
By performing
a magic trick on me.

35:01.383 --> 35:05.011
Take this piece of paper
in your left hand.

35:05.054 --> 35:07.055
I'll need a coin. Ah!

35:07.097 --> 35:08.556
Yes, there's one.

35:08.599 --> 35:10.391
Oh!

35:10.434 --> 35:14.813
I want you to hold
that silver dollar in your hand

35:14.855 --> 35:16.856
Between your thumb
and your forefinger.

35:16.899 --> 35:19.025
I will begin counting.

35:19.068 --> 35:23.238
Whenever you feel compelled, all you
need to do is simply drop the coin.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.240
Ready?

35:25.282 --> 35:30.578
One, two,

35:30.621 --> 35:32.580
Three,

35:32.623 --> 35:37.919
Four.

35:39.922 --> 35:41.089
Five.

35:41.131 --> 35:42.882
- 20 seconds, Cindy.
- Six.

35:42.925 --> 35:45.718
Cindy, you do understand
that at some point in time

35:45.761 --> 35:48.805
- You have to let the coin drop.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

35:48.848 --> 35:51.307
- Maybe I didn't understand.
- 10 seconds, Cindy.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.767
We're almost out of time.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.978
But we can do this
very quickly. Go ahead.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.022
Hold out your hand.
We'll try it one more time very quickly.

35:58.065 --> 35:59.941
Ready...

35:59.984 --> 36:02.277
- I'm sorry, we are out of time, Buck.
- Oh my God.

36:02.319 --> 36:05.154
- And thank you...
- Cut 'em off.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.283
- Let's don't drop the coin...
- We're out.

36:08.325 --> 36:10.994
Maybe you could come back
at some other point in the future.

36:12.621 --> 36:14.664
Listen, I'm sorry.
Mr. Howard...

36:20.254 --> 36:22.213
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?

36:22.256 --> 36:25.049
He won't pick up his phone
and I'm trying to apologize.

36:25.092 --> 36:28.303
I don't know what for,
but I am trying to apologize.

36:28.345 --> 36:30.930
It's okay. Just relax.

36:30.973 --> 36:32.932
Trust me.
This is what Buck is like.

36:32.975 --> 36:35.435
Tomorrow he'll act like
nothing happened.

36:35.477 --> 36:37.353
What are we doing here?

36:38.856 --> 36:40.648
I mean, seriously,

36:40.691 --> 36:42.442
How on earth does a guy like you

36:42.484 --> 36:43.902
Wind up working with Buck Howard?

36:43.944 --> 36:46.404
- I want to know.
- I had just quit law school

36:46.447 --> 36:47.989
And moved to L.A.

36:48.032 --> 36:51.326
I bet you wish you'd just stayed in
school right about now.

36:51.368 --> 36:52.952
No way.

36:52.995 --> 36:55.705
Look, Buck is no picnic,

36:55.748 --> 36:58.499
But law school was...
oh my God.

36:58.542 --> 37:00.460
I would wake up every day there

37:00.502 --> 37:02.462
Just dreading life.

37:02.504 --> 37:06.549
Look, I'll admit I have
no idea what I'm doing,

37:06.592 --> 37:09.344
And obviously I've got to
quit this job and figure it out,

37:09.386 --> 37:12.680
But I'm trying,

37:12.723 --> 37:14.682
And it feels good.

37:14.725 --> 37:16.851
It feels like what I'm supposed
to do, you know?

37:16.894 --> 37:19.729
Oh, come on.
You're not supposed to do anything.

37:19.772 --> 37:22.357
Life is not magical like that, okay?

37:22.399 --> 37:23.942
No one is supposed to do anything.

37:23.984 --> 37:25.902
How do you know that?

37:25.945 --> 37:28.696
'Cause it boils down
to the same thing for everyone,

37:28.739 --> 37:32.367
From Buck Howard
to Meryl Streep to you.

37:32.409 --> 37:36.454
Most creative people, they just want
the world to love and adore them,

37:36.497 --> 37:37.872
Which is infantile.

37:37.915 --> 37:39.749
Okay, all right.

37:39.792 --> 37:43.586
Maybe I'm naive, but

37:43.629 --> 37:46.089
Life is short,

37:46.131 --> 37:49.300
You know?
I mean, someday

37:49.343 --> 37:50.885
We're not gonna be here.

37:50.928 --> 37:53.304
And if that's the case,

37:53.347 --> 37:57.392
I want to spend the time
that I have doing something

37:57.434 --> 37:59.227
That makes my heart race.

37:59.269 --> 38:02.271
I don't care what
that says about me.

38:02.314 --> 38:04.357
It's how I feel.

38:06.068 --> 38:08.277
That really turns me on.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.406
Are you serious?

38:11.448 --> 38:15.618
Yeah. That whole existential thing...

38:18.414 --> 38:20.957
I have a boyfriend.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.042
Oh, forget I said it.

38:38.308 --> 38:40.685
- Hello?
- Troy, are you asleep?

38:40.728 --> 38:43.479
Buck, no, I'm awake.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.148
I just think I'm coming down
with something. What's up?

38:45.190 --> 38:47.150
Where the hell is Valerie?

38:47.192 --> 38:49.944
She's supposed to be
organizing interviews for me today.

38:49.987 --> 38:52.655
I have no idea where she is.

38:54.491 --> 38:57.410
I don't know where she is exactly,

38:57.453 --> 39:00.413
But I'm sure she's on top of it.

39:00.456 --> 39:02.123
I'll try and track her down.

39:02.166 --> 39:05.001
I was just on my way
to the theater right now.

39:05.044 --> 39:07.670
Well, I'll be in my room preparing
for the show tonight.

39:07.713 --> 39:10.715
I don't want to be disturbed
unless it's for press.

39:10.758 --> 39:13.259
Okay.

39:13.302 --> 39:15.970
Spotlight on me.
Buck will enter stage right,

39:16.013 --> 39:18.181
Come up to the microphone...
"I love this town"...

39:18.223 --> 39:19.766
Do a few effects.

39:19.808 --> 39:21.809
Eventually he will come
over to the piano.

39:21.852 --> 39:24.687
Basically just stay on Buck
the whole time. That's all you...

39:30.402 --> 39:33.696
- Hi.
- Mmm.

39:35.616 --> 39:37.533
- Uh...
- Oh, uh...

39:37.576 --> 39:39.285
I have to show you something.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.710
Edward's article.

39:49.505 --> 39:51.089
Now, I heard it was coming,

39:51.131 --> 39:53.841
And I heard it was bad...

39:53.884 --> 39:56.469
It's, I mean, yeah...

39:56.512 --> 39:58.971
He pretty much makes fun
of Buck the entire time.

40:02.059 --> 40:04.185
Okay.

40:04.228 --> 40:07.730
Uh, we can't let him see this.

40:09.399 --> 40:11.484
No, it's this one
right here, Mr. Howard.

40:11.527 --> 40:13.194
Oh.

40:13.237 --> 40:16.989
Mr. Howard, I just wanted to
ask you if it would be okay

40:17.032 --> 40:19.242
For me to introduce you
before the show tonight.

40:19.284 --> 40:22.036
No, it wouldn't be okay.
I'm always introduced on tape...

40:22.079 --> 40:23.746
Always have been, always will be.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.749
That's a nice outfit, though.
Very becoming.

40:31.547 --> 40:34.757
Just there, Kenny.
Thank you.

40:37.761 --> 40:39.720
- Kenny, that will be all, thank you.
- Yep, okay.

40:39.763 --> 40:41.931
I'm all over there.

40:41.974 --> 40:44.517
Troy, this is urgent.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.020
I don't want this Kenny fellow
anywhere near me.

40:48.063 --> 40:51.858
Our policy is "Out of the way, freak,
I have to catch a train."

40:51.900 --> 40:53.943
Do you understand?

40:53.986 --> 40:56.362
Give him a photo,
a colored one.

40:56.405 --> 40:58.406
Actually, no, get him
a black and white.

40:58.448 --> 41:02.618
Second thing... why didn't we do
any more interviews today?

41:02.661 --> 41:05.746
What is the mental midget
Valerie doing?

41:05.789 --> 41:07.373
She got you an interview today.

41:07.416 --> 41:09.041
In fact, they're on
their way here right now.

41:09.084 --> 41:11.043
- With who?
- An internet columnist.

41:11.086 --> 41:12.753
I don't even know that paper.

41:12.796 --> 41:14.755
And it's here and now,
in a few minutes.

41:14.798 --> 41:16.674
I knew nothing about it.

41:16.717 --> 41:20.011
This is the time I have
to prepare for the show, Troy,

41:20.053 --> 41:21.929
And what good would it do
to do an interview now?

41:21.972 --> 41:26.767
I think Valerie is concentrating
more on tomorrow's big event.

41:26.810 --> 41:29.395
She was told that the locals here
would pack the place tonight.

41:31.982 --> 41:36.110
Buck, I have Mark Simpson
here to interview you.

41:36.153 --> 41:39.572
Hello, young man.
I have heard a lot about you.

41:39.615 --> 41:42.408
- I'm a really big fan.
- Whoa.

41:42.451 --> 41:47.705
Come on over, sit with me.
Pull you up a chair.

41:47.748 --> 41:49.916
I won't have long to give you.

41:49.958 --> 41:51.834
I've had a lot of press today.

42:07.851 --> 42:08.893
Buck, are you ready?

42:08.936 --> 42:11.145
Yeah.

42:11.188 --> 42:13.564
Okay, Jeff, Buck is ready.

42:13.607 --> 42:15.650
House lights down.

42:18.028 --> 42:19.362
Cue tape.

42:21.365 --> 42:23.574
Stage lights, please.

42:23.617 --> 42:25.826
- What is she doing?
- Thank you.

42:25.869 --> 42:28.454
It's okay.
She's got a big surprise for you.

42:28.497 --> 42:30.456
I wanted to welcome
the Great Buck Howard...

42:30.499 --> 42:33.334
- Oh my God.
- To Cincinnati in my own special way,

42:33.377 --> 42:37.505
So I composed a little song.
I hope he likes it.

42:37.547 --> 42:39.131
Troy, stop her.

42:39.174 --> 42:40.675
How?

42:40.717 --> 42:44.679
Do you believe in magic?

42:44.721 --> 42:47.390
Well, Buck Howard is here

42:47.432 --> 42:49.392
He's gonna give a great show

42:49.434 --> 42:51.435
So you don't have to fear

42:51.478 --> 42:54.021
There'll be some magic

42:54.064 --> 42:56.315
And some mentalism too

42:56.358 --> 42:58.317
And if we're really lucky

42:58.360 --> 43:01.654
He might even play the pian-Oo

43:01.697 --> 43:06.617
Do you believe in magic?

43:06.660 --> 43:10.788
Do you believe
in ma-A-Gic?

43:10.831 --> 43:16.752
Do you believe in ma-A-A-Gic?

43:21.842 --> 43:25.011
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard!

43:25.053 --> 43:28.556
Come on, Buck!

43:28.598 --> 43:31.267
The Great Buck Howard,
everybody!

43:38.608 --> 43:40.901
That was the most amateurish thing

43:40.944 --> 43:44.322
I've had to live
through in 40 years.

43:44.364 --> 43:46.532
She nearly ruined the show.

43:46.575 --> 43:50.202
There is a reason, Troy,
I am called the Great Buck Howard.

43:50.245 --> 43:53.914
Not the Okay Buck Howard,
not the not Bad Buck Howard,

43:53.957 --> 43:56.375
- The Great Buck Howard!
- I know. I'm sorry.

43:56.418 --> 43:59.670
I do not want to see
either of those people

43:59.713 --> 44:01.255
For the remainder of our stay here.

44:01.298 --> 44:03.758
We rent our own car, a cheap one,

44:03.800 --> 44:05.926
And we drive ourselves around.

44:05.969 --> 44:07.762
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

44:07.804 --> 44:11.390
I barely got this show
back tonight, Troy.

44:11.433 --> 44:14.560
The audience thought
we were clowns.

44:14.603 --> 44:17.355
And by the way,
you are partially to blame.

44:17.397 --> 44:19.231
Buck, there is no way
I could have known

44:19.274 --> 44:20.900
That she was gonna pull that.

44:20.942 --> 44:22.735
Yes, that's true.
You only could have known

44:22.778 --> 44:24.737
If you were someone
who is observant.

44:24.780 --> 44:28.908
But you're clearly not
someone who is observant.

44:28.950 --> 44:31.577
Could you leave
my dressing room, please?

44:39.878 --> 44:43.714
- He seemed really pissed.
- He was.

44:45.842 --> 44:48.302
She just wanted to sing,
man, you know?

44:48.345 --> 44:51.597
Kenny, I don't know
what to tell you,

44:51.640 --> 44:55.059
But this is the way it's gotta be.

44:56.728 --> 44:58.020
Yeah.

45:00.023 --> 45:02.024
He wanted you to have
one of these, though.

45:07.364 --> 45:09.365
Now that's class.

45:11.868 --> 45:14.787
We mess up his whole show,

45:14.830 --> 45:17.331
But he's still got enough goodness

45:17.374 --> 45:20.709
To give me a really cool picture.

45:22.504 --> 45:24.839
I will treasure this, Troy.

45:24.881 --> 45:26.340
I know you will.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.063
Who's this guy?

45:41.106 --> 45:44.275
That's Alan.
He was Buck's road manager before me.

45:44.317 --> 45:46.277
There's like
a whole section about him.

45:46.319 --> 45:47.987
Buck is gonna die
when he sees this.

45:48.029 --> 45:49.989
It's hard to feel bad for him.

45:50.031 --> 45:52.241
He has this face
you just want to punch.

45:53.785 --> 45:55.744
How does he do
the things in his act?

45:55.787 --> 45:57.705
I mean, how does
he find the money?

45:57.747 --> 45:59.957
- And I know you know.
- I don't know.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.876
I heard he has a guy
who travels around with him

46:01.918 --> 46:04.211
And he slips into the audience
and he tells him where the money is.

46:06.089 --> 46:08.048
How? When?
He's being watched the whole time.

46:08.091 --> 46:09.884
- He has a hearing aid.
- He does not have a hearing aid.

46:09.926 --> 46:13.220
Besides, that is impractical.

46:13.263 --> 46:16.182
Buck would have to have
someone on payroll year round,

46:16.224 --> 46:18.809
And he's too much
of a cheapskate for that.

46:18.852 --> 46:21.312
You're cute,

46:21.354 --> 46:25.065
'Cause you like believing
he's real, don't you?

46:25.108 --> 46:29.361
I cannot wait for
this weekend to be over.

46:31.156 --> 46:34.408
Not that it...
I didn't mean about...

46:34.451 --> 46:36.160
I just hate working with...

46:36.203 --> 46:37.703
You're great. This has been...

46:37.746 --> 46:39.246
It's okay. It's okay.

46:39.289 --> 46:41.707
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't even be here.

46:41.750 --> 46:43.709
I should just...

46:43.752 --> 46:46.420
Go back to my...

46:46.463 --> 46:48.422
Room.

46:48.465 --> 46:49.965
Right?

46:57.098 --> 46:59.266
Yeah, you should
just go to your room.

46:59.309 --> 47:03.270
Go ahead. Go.
I'll see you in the morning.

47:03.313 --> 47:04.647
What?

47:04.689 --> 47:06.649
- Go to your room.
- Troy, I...

47:06.691 --> 47:08.609
I was just... are you...?

47:11.488 --> 47:13.239
No, stay.

47:13.281 --> 47:15.241
A night on my own
in Cincinnati...

47:15.283 --> 47:16.784
By this point,

47:16.826 --> 47:18.911
All I could really think
was one thing...

47:18.954 --> 47:22.706
Thank God I did not quit
this job before Cincinnati.

47:22.749 --> 47:25.626
The town hadn't been
as kind to Buck, though.

47:25.669 --> 47:29.672
But that didn't matter, because the
whole weekend was about his big effect.

47:29.714 --> 47:32.508
Buck was counting on it
to change everything for him.

47:32.551 --> 47:35.302
And on the day,
it looked like it just might.

47:35.345 --> 47:36.804
You're very good at what you do,

47:36.846 --> 47:38.472
'Cause this is a lot of people.

47:38.515 --> 47:40.307
There's like 300 so far,

47:40.350 --> 47:42.059
And the press turnout's great.

47:42.102 --> 47:43.644
So yeah, if you just tell him

47:43.687 --> 47:45.145
To go get ready, we're good.

47:45.188 --> 47:47.147
Okay.

47:47.190 --> 47:50.150
Thank you ma'am. Hi, just sign here
and make your way...

48:02.497 --> 48:06.875
Thank you. Silence, please.
I need complete silence.

48:06.918 --> 48:11.297
I have already begun
to take a mental picture

48:11.339 --> 48:14.174
Of each and every one of you here.

48:14.217 --> 48:17.177
If I feel you are not suited

48:17.220 --> 48:19.513
To this task,

48:19.556 --> 48:21.807
I will tap you on the shoulder

48:21.850 --> 48:24.602
And for your own safety

48:24.644 --> 48:28.188
You will go off to one side,

48:28.231 --> 48:32.526
Where you will become
an observer

48:32.569 --> 48:36.030
And no longer a participant.

48:45.415 --> 48:47.374
Please focus on me.

48:47.417 --> 48:50.210
Let no outside stimuli

48:50.253 --> 48:53.631
Break this little bubble
we've formed between us.

48:58.219 --> 49:01.722
This is getting to be
the ideal group.

49:01.765 --> 49:03.724
We're almost ready to begin.

49:03.767 --> 49:06.935
Stop.

49:14.194 --> 49:17.738
Members of the press,
we're delighted that you're here,

49:17.781 --> 49:21.116
But in order to ensure
your ability to cover this event,

49:21.159 --> 49:25.245
I urge you not to listen
too carefully to what I am going to say.

49:25.288 --> 49:27.581
Please. Now, let us begin.

49:27.624 --> 49:31.126
Ladies and gentlemen,
listen to the sound of my voice

49:31.169 --> 49:32.753
And only my voice.

49:32.796 --> 49:35.756
I will now count from one to 20.

49:35.799 --> 49:40.094
While I am counting, you will slowly
feel yourselves becoming tired.

49:40.136 --> 49:44.098
In fact, more than tired.
You will feel exhausted.

49:44.140 --> 49:45.766
But this is good.

49:45.809 --> 49:48.268
You have come
to the right place.

49:48.311 --> 49:52.815
This is the ideal locale
to lie down and take a rest.

49:52.857 --> 49:56.694
If you decide to lower yourselves

49:56.736 --> 49:58.570
Down to the ground,

49:58.613 --> 50:01.573
Be my guest. One, two,

50:01.616 --> 50:03.534
Three, four...

50:03.576 --> 50:05.536
Hey hey.

50:05.578 --> 50:08.914
Six, seven...

50:08.957 --> 50:10.916
Eight, nine...

50:10.959 --> 50:13.502
- Where are you going?
- 10...

50:13.545 --> 50:15.879
Where are you all going?
Somebody has to stay here.

50:15.922 --> 50:17.798
11, 12...

50:17.841 --> 50:19.925
Jerry Springer has had
some frickin' accident

50:19.968 --> 50:21.802
And everyone's leaving to cover it.

50:21.845 --> 50:23.804
- Did you say Jerry Springer?
- 15...

50:23.847 --> 50:26.306
Jerry Springer used
to be like the mayor of Cincinnati...

50:26.349 --> 50:29.143
- 17...
- Are they gonna come back?

50:29.185 --> 50:32.062
- Where was the accident? Was it close?
- Columbia Parkway.

50:32.105 --> 50:33.480
It was close.

50:33.523 --> 50:37.025
20.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.821
Jeez, he did it.

50:51.750 --> 50:56.545
Jerry Springer got into
a car accident on the Columbia Parkway

50:56.588 --> 50:59.673
And they all got
called away to cover it.

50:59.716 --> 51:04.553
- Who?
- Jerry Springer.

51:04.596 --> 51:07.598
He was on a TV show a while back.
It was kind of a big thing.

51:07.640 --> 51:12.019
Prior to his TV show
he was the mayor of Cincinnati,

51:12.061 --> 51:14.021
So he's kind of popular here.

51:14.063 --> 51:18.609
It's this pin. It is cursed!

51:22.697 --> 51:24.490
Let's go.

51:24.532 --> 51:27.117
I give up.

51:27.160 --> 51:29.203
Buck...

51:31.706 --> 51:32.873
What?

51:36.419 --> 51:38.086
These people are still asleep.

51:52.268 --> 51:54.269
Wake up.

51:55.772 --> 51:56.772
Wake up.

51:58.858 --> 52:00.776
Wake up!

52:02.403 --> 52:07.241
Wake up.

52:16.543 --> 52:19.461
Make your way,
thank you very much for coming.

52:22.215 --> 52:24.800
Buck, I'm really sorry
about your thing, it's...

52:24.843 --> 52:27.135
Let me get this straight...

52:27.178 --> 52:30.806
The entire local press corps had
to leave to cover a traffic accident?

52:30.849 --> 52:32.266
Yeah, uh... yeah.

52:32.308 --> 52:34.643
Why didn't you get
the national press here

52:34.686 --> 52:37.104
As I asked?
They wouldn't have had to leave.

52:37.146 --> 52:39.773
I tried and I couldn't
get any to come.

52:39.816 --> 52:42.276
No, I'm sure you couldn't,
because you were so busy

52:42.318 --> 52:46.071
Servicing Troy's needs
that you couldn't service mine.

52:46.114 --> 52:48.282
- Buck!
- Don't say a word.

52:48.324 --> 52:51.869
I've just performed
one of the most stunning feats

52:51.911 --> 52:53.787
In the history of mentalism,

52:53.830 --> 52:56.456
And there was no one to see it.

52:56.499 --> 52:59.167
This was going to change
everything for me.

52:59.210 --> 53:03.463
The two of you have delayed
my resurgence by months.

53:03.506 --> 53:06.967
And I will have you fired
tomorrow morning, I promise you.

53:07.010 --> 53:08.886
Let's go, Troy.

53:11.347 --> 53:12.973
I wasn't gonna give you this,

53:13.016 --> 53:17.561
Didn't want to be the one.

53:17.604 --> 53:21.607
But now I just don't care.

53:21.649 --> 53:22.858
Goodbye, Buck.

53:26.237 --> 53:27.905
Buck, you can't just...

53:29.407 --> 53:32.326
Forget it. Valerie!

53:55.642 --> 53:58.518
- Valerie, wait.
- I just want to get out of here, okay?

53:58.561 --> 54:01.563
- My blood is boiling.
- I don't blame you.

54:01.606 --> 54:04.566
I'm done, Troy. Never in my life
have I been spoken to...

54:04.609 --> 54:06.693
- I'm done.
- I know. Me too.

54:20.249 --> 54:22.918
Excuse me.

54:22.961 --> 54:26.171
One, two, three, four, five,

54:26.214 --> 54:28.215
One, two,
three, four, five,

54:28.257 --> 54:30.801
One, two, three,
four, five...

54:37.767 --> 54:40.185
He's fine. We're gonna keep him
overnight and run some tests,

54:40.228 --> 54:42.187
But I think it was
just exhaustion.

54:42.230 --> 54:44.564
Really?
So he's gonna be okay?

54:44.607 --> 54:46.441
Well, he did pinch a nerve.

54:46.484 --> 54:48.235
Whoever gave him C.P.R.
Didn't know what they were doing.

54:48.277 --> 54:50.320
Thank you.

55:00.665 --> 55:03.750
- This is it.
- Yeah.

55:03.793 --> 55:06.086
Yeah.

55:06.129 --> 55:08.839
It's been really nice
being with you, Troy,

55:08.881 --> 55:10.757
You know, and...

55:10.800 --> 55:14.970
Just... you know,
I'm in L.A. All the time

55:15.013 --> 55:17.931
And maybe I'll call you sometime,
you know, when I'm...

55:17.974 --> 55:19.808
In L.A.

55:21.811 --> 55:24.479
- Have a safe trip.
- Okay.

55:37.785 --> 55:39.119
One thing... you...

55:39.162 --> 55:41.121
You've gotta quit this job.

55:41.164 --> 55:42.956
You know you can do better,

55:42.999 --> 55:46.126
And I know people.
I could probably help.

55:47.879 --> 55:49.755
- Okay?
- Okay.

55:49.797 --> 55:53.800
It is over for Buck
and everyone knows it but him.

56:19.535 --> 56:21.828
No, it's not life-Threatening.

56:21.871 --> 56:23.705
He just fainted.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.707
Look, my wife said
she's leaving me

56:25.750 --> 56:27.751
If I let a client ruin
another vacation.

56:27.794 --> 56:30.962
I can't go unless his life
is in imminent danger.

56:31.005 --> 56:32.964
Gil, what am
I supposed to do here?

56:33.007 --> 56:34.758
What do you mean?

56:34.801 --> 56:37.761
Isn't there someone
I should call or notify?

56:37.804 --> 56:40.347
No. Troy, there's no one.

56:40.389 --> 56:41.890
It's just you.

56:48.106 --> 56:49.397
Okay.

56:58.825 --> 57:02.202
I am going to sue
that human rectum Edward

57:02.245 --> 57:04.371
And his disgusting magazine

57:04.413 --> 57:06.039
Right out of business.

57:06.082 --> 57:07.791
They were deceptive, malicious,

57:07.834 --> 57:12.212
Not to mention I was supposed
to be on the cover.

57:15.383 --> 57:18.051
I'm sorry about some
of the things I said.

57:18.094 --> 57:21.429
I was very upset.
It wasn't you.

57:23.307 --> 57:25.058
I never told anyone this,

57:25.101 --> 57:28.436
But I did do
"The Tonight Show" 61 times,

57:28.479 --> 57:32.858
But I didn't appear once
in Johnny's last 10 years.

57:32.900 --> 57:35.652
I have no idea why.

57:35.695 --> 57:40.574
They just stopped calling.
No one ever explained.

57:40.616 --> 57:43.285
Even at the end
when Johnny was retiring,

57:43.327 --> 57:46.705
I kept hoping that he'd call
for one last show,

57:46.747 --> 57:48.915
But he never did.

57:48.958 --> 57:53.879
That's actually when I realized
that it was probably over for me.

57:53.921 --> 57:58.091
I've been denying it ever since.

57:58.134 --> 57:59.843
It's exhausting.

58:01.637 --> 58:03.388
You still entertain
a lot of people, Buck.

58:03.431 --> 58:05.390
You still put on a good show.

58:05.433 --> 58:08.268
A good show. A good show.

58:08.311 --> 58:12.397
How are we today, Mister...

58:12.440 --> 58:13.440
Howard?

58:13.482 --> 58:16.067
Horrible!

58:16.110 --> 58:18.069
How's Gary Singer?

58:18.112 --> 58:20.614
You mean Jerry Springer.
Very well.

58:20.656 --> 58:22.782
It was a minor accident.

58:22.825 --> 58:24.451
He checked out last night.

58:24.493 --> 58:26.453
I'm sorry to hear that.

58:29.165 --> 58:31.208
Seeing Buck like this was hard.

58:31.250 --> 58:33.210
Despite everything,
I'd come to feel

58:33.252 --> 58:35.837
Not exactly affection for him,

58:35.880 --> 58:37.839
But something like it.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.382
This was the end, though,

58:39.425 --> 58:41.301
And just like Valerie had said,

58:41.344 --> 58:43.553
It was over for Buck.

58:43.596 --> 58:45.639
Legendary performer
and mentalist Buck Howard

58:45.681 --> 58:49.142
Collapsed and was rushed
to University Hospital yesterday.

58:49.185 --> 58:51.144
Conflicting reports suggest
that Mr. Howard suffered

58:51.187 --> 58:53.563
Somewhat of
a mental breakdown

58:53.606 --> 58:57.484
After setting a new world record
in a stunning performance...

58:57.526 --> 58:59.402
...is best known
for his many appearances

58:59.445 --> 59:01.404
On "The Tonight Show
with Johnny Carson"...

59:01.447 --> 59:03.823
Our reporter Judd McKinley
was on hand yesterday

59:03.866 --> 59:05.659
And got this eyewitness footage.

59:05.701 --> 59:09.454
And Mr. Howard,
he seemed totally out of it...

59:09.497 --> 59:11.498
Delivery for Mr. Howard.

59:15.253 --> 59:18.171
Call Gil and tell him
I'm in imminent danger.

59:18.214 --> 59:19.839
He'll know what it means.

59:19.882 --> 59:22.926
This train is leaving the station

59:22.969 --> 59:25.595
And we've got to be on it.

59:25.638 --> 59:29.349
And bring these bouquets.
They're worth a lot of money.

59:29.392 --> 59:31.643
The legendary mentalist
Buck Howard,

59:31.686 --> 59:35.021
Best known for his many appearances on
"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,"

59:35.064 --> 59:39.025
Checked himself out of a hospital
in Cincinnati on Monday,

59:39.068 --> 59:41.027
After the completion
of a highly taxing stunt

59:41.070 --> 59:43.822
Where he put some
800 people to sleep.

59:43.864 --> 59:46.616
Mary Hart was just the beginning.

59:46.659 --> 59:48.201
No one could have predicted it,

59:48.244 --> 59:50.829
But suddenly Buck was hip.

59:50.871 --> 59:52.831
David, it's great
to have you on T.R.L.

59:52.873 --> 59:54.124
Everyone's enjoying you here.

59:54.166 --> 59:56.293
We do have a big
surprise for you here.

59:56.335 --> 59:58.128
We're gonna bring him out.

59:58.170 --> 01:00:02.465
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Great Buck Howard! Come on out!

01:00:02.508 --> 01:00:04.342
I love this town!

01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:07.554
And I love this man,
David Blainefield!

01:00:07.596 --> 01:00:10.974
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:00:11.017 --> 01:00:13.643
Why don't we just
mentally shake hands?

01:00:15.563 --> 01:00:19.441
Do you have insight
into the mindset of the kids today?

01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:20.734
What's your take on kids today?

01:00:20.776 --> 01:00:23.570
I suppose I have
some degree of insight,

01:00:23.612 --> 01:00:26.114
And I have one major worry,

01:00:26.157 --> 01:00:29.284
And that worry can be
summed up in one word:

01:00:29.327 --> 01:00:31.494
Drugs.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:37.167
Today we'll be preparing
one of Buck Howard's original recipes

01:00:37.209 --> 01:00:39.836
From his new book,
"Mentally Cooked."

01:00:39.879 --> 01:00:42.589
Since this picture was taken, it looks
like you've had a little work done,

01:00:42.631 --> 01:00:45.717
- Around the eyes, I think.
- No, nothing's changed.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.594
You don't have to be
defensive about it.

01:00:47.636 --> 01:00:49.929
- No, I don't.
- A lot of people have work done.

01:00:49.972 --> 01:00:51.806
But not me.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:54.434
Now, Buck, this is quite incredible.
You're hip now.

01:00:54.477 --> 01:00:55.769
Are you aware that you're hip?

01:00:55.811 --> 01:00:58.104
I'm aware that I'm hip,

01:00:58.147 --> 01:00:59.689
And I have to say, Colin,

01:00:59.732 --> 01:01:01.900
- I've always been hip.
- It's Conan.

01:01:01.942 --> 01:01:03.568
Oh, right.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:09.407
I love this town!

01:01:10.493 --> 01:01:13.203
Buck, how are you? Whoa!

01:01:14.663 --> 01:01:15.997
Wow!

01:01:18.834 --> 01:01:20.794
Buck, it's good to have you here.

01:01:20.836 --> 01:01:23.296
- It's great to be back.
- Oh my gosh, yes indeed.

01:01:23.339 --> 01:01:24.964
I don't think I'll be the same.

01:01:25.007 --> 01:01:27.926
Buck, I've got a friend
of yours backstage

01:01:27.968 --> 01:01:30.178
Who you haven't seen
in quite a while now.

01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:31.805
So I'm gonna bring him out
right now. You ready?

01:01:31.847 --> 01:01:34.557
Ladies and gentlemen,
George Takei!

01:01:42.149 --> 01:01:45.443
What the world
needs now

01:01:45.486 --> 01:01:50.156
Is love, sweet love

01:01:50.199 --> 01:01:51.950
It's the only thing...

01:01:51.992 --> 01:01:53.952
- I love this man!
- That there's

01:01:53.994 --> 01:01:56.871
Just too little of.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:01.584
In the wake
of this whole crazy circus,

01:02:01.627 --> 01:02:04.337
The call came in that Buck
had been waiting for.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:07.048
It was Vegas. There was talk
of a headline spot,

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:08.883
Even a long-Term deal.

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:10.969
But now, Buck
wouldn't hear of it.

01:02:11.011 --> 01:02:14.222
And why would he?
He was beyond Vegas.

01:02:14.265 --> 01:02:16.558
He was bigger
than he had ever been,

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.144
And he was about to make
a triumphant return to the place

01:02:19.186 --> 01:02:21.020
Where it had all started for him.

01:02:21.063 --> 01:02:23.940
It's "The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno,"

01:02:23.983 --> 01:02:27.026
Featuring Kevin Eubanks
and the Tonight Show band.

01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:29.779
Tonight, Jay welcomes
Tom Arnold,

01:02:29.822 --> 01:02:33.199
Mentalist Buck Howard...

01:02:33.242 --> 01:02:35.201
Okay.

01:02:35.244 --> 01:02:40.748
And now, Jay Leno!

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:43.001
...you're right. I can't tell you.

01:02:43.043 --> 01:02:44.711
- We're about out of time.
- Okay okay.

01:02:44.753 --> 01:02:46.379
Do you even have
anything to promote?

01:02:46.422 --> 01:02:48.047
No, I just came to hang out.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:49.299
You're not
at the Chuckle Hut next week?

01:02:49.341 --> 01:02:51.092
No, I just got nowhere to go.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.219
Tom, we gotta go.
My apologies to magician Buck Howard.

01:02:53.262 --> 01:02:54.637
We were not able to
bring him on tonight,

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.848
We were having so much
fun with Tom,

01:02:56.891 --> 01:02:59.225
Time got away with us.
We'll have him back at another time.

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:01.644
Good night. Stay tuned for Conan,
coming up next. Good night, everybody!

01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:05.982
So, I'm bumped for Tom Arnold.

01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:08.443
I don't even know who that is.

01:03:10.237 --> 01:03:11.863
Hey, Buck,
I am so sorry, man.

01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:13.531
My wife left me for a rich guy

01:03:13.574 --> 01:03:15.116
And my mom got busted
for crystal meth,

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:17.118
So I had a lot of funny material.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:18.536
It just kept going on.

01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:20.038
You inspired me
to come to Hollywood.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.040
Do you remember this?
1978, Ottumwa, Iowa,

01:03:22.082 --> 01:03:24.375
The coliseum?
You signed this for me. You rocked.

01:03:24.418 --> 01:03:26.127
Excuse me.
Buck, Jay wanted me to tell you

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.254
He's very sorry.
It couldn't be helped.

01:03:28.297 --> 01:03:31.090
- Buck. Buck.
- Thank you, Buck. You rocked!

01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:34.385
Come on, you're not the first person
in the world to get bumped.

01:03:34.428 --> 01:03:36.387
We want to have
you on next week.

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:39.599
Do you know how many times
I did "The Tonight Show"?

01:03:39.642 --> 01:03:43.436
61. Do you know how many times
Johnny Carson bumped me?

01:03:43.479 --> 01:03:46.272
Zero. None. Nada.

01:03:46.315 --> 01:03:50.485
You can tell Jay to take
his apology and shove it!

01:03:50.528 --> 01:03:53.863
Do you want to be on
the show next week or not?

01:03:53.906 --> 01:03:56.449
That man is Satan.

01:03:56.492 --> 01:04:00.828
And Buck Howard
does not work with Satan.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:11.047
Gil, call Vegas.
Let's hear what they have to say.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.649
Hello hello.

01:04:29.692 --> 01:04:31.401
Hi.

01:04:33.153 --> 01:04:34.195
Hello.

01:04:35.364 --> 01:04:36.739
Hey.

01:04:40.369 --> 01:04:42.996
Welcome back to Vegas, Buck!

01:04:43.038 --> 01:04:44.998
- Thank you.
- Hey. Dan Green.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.332
Nice to meet you, Dan.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.835
Michael Perry... oh, wow.
Quite a handshake.

01:04:48.877 --> 01:04:52.255
The old Buck Howard handshake.
That's fantastic.

01:04:52.298 --> 01:04:54.966
By the way, a great job
on the Stewarts... Jon and Martha.

01:04:55.009 --> 01:04:56.384
Unbelievable, really.

01:04:56.427 --> 01:04:58.511
- Good exposure for you.
- Buck, you look great.

01:04:58.554 --> 01:05:00.763
- I mean the whole... the...
- Very fresh.

01:05:00.806 --> 01:05:02.348
- It's got a...
- Yeah, it's terrific.

01:05:02.391 --> 01:05:04.601
Listen, I'm gonna jump in.

01:05:04.643 --> 01:05:07.103
Buck, as Gil already knows,
we've been courting you.

01:05:07.146 --> 01:05:09.147
After the comeback you've had
we think Vegas is

01:05:09.189 --> 01:05:11.232
- The perfect place for you.
- Perfect.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:13.651
We don't mean
to offend at all, but we did

01:05:13.694 --> 01:05:15.903
- Conduct some initial research...
- Yeah, and so Gilly sent us

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:18.615
A few tapes, and we screened them
for a focus group, and...

01:05:18.657 --> 01:05:21.284
Yeah. The magic-Slash-Mentalist
part of the show

01:05:21.327 --> 01:05:23.202
Where you're doing the hypnosis

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:24.871
And you're looking for your money

01:05:24.913 --> 01:05:27.540
- Scored really high.
- Yeah, through the roof.

01:05:27.583 --> 01:05:31.294
However, the piano and the standup
portion of your show...

01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:35.214
- Mmm, not so much.
- A little more on the lower end.

01:05:35.257 --> 01:05:37.967
- Yeah. Not bad...
- No, not awful.

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:39.886
Just... a... little...

01:05:39.928 --> 01:05:41.804
Any thoughts?

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:45.475
Well, I, um...

01:05:45.517 --> 01:05:48.102
I want to get back to Vegas,

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:51.648
And it's not that
I don't find it sickening

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:55.943
That people don't like
the standup and the piano,

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.529
But I'm open for suggestion.

01:05:58.572 --> 01:06:01.115
- Ah.
- Great. Okay.

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:02.909
- That's what we wanted to hear.
- That's where we were headed.

01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:04.243
That's Teddy.

01:06:04.286 --> 01:06:06.162
I'll be right back.

01:06:06.205 --> 01:06:08.498
We're not gonna change anything big.
It is the Buck Howard show.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.458
Oh, Buck, I gotta tell you, my mom...

01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:12.460
This was Buck's shot.

01:06:12.503 --> 01:06:14.962
The hype had died down
and now this is what was left.

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:18.633
Maybe this is where Buck belonged...
back in Vegas,

01:06:18.676 --> 01:06:20.760
With his name in bright lights.

01:06:20.803 --> 01:06:22.929
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:22.971 --> 01:06:26.307
Get ready for a night
that will overwhelm your senses,

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:30.269
Expand your mind,
and thrill your soul.

01:06:30.312 --> 01:06:34.065
Presenting the Great Buck Howard!

01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:54.210
And your number is...

01:06:54.253 --> 01:06:57.463
- 17.
- Oh my God!

01:06:57.506 --> 01:06:59.757
Show the crowd.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.676
How 'bout that, folks?

01:07:01.719 --> 01:07:03.302
Isn't that wild, folks?

01:07:03.345 --> 01:07:05.888
Isn't that wild? It's wild!

01:07:22.448 --> 01:07:25.658
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments time

01:07:25.701 --> 01:07:31.414
These fine citizens will wake up
with a snap of my finger.

01:07:31.457 --> 01:07:35.543
They will believe someone has
removed all of their clothes...

01:07:37.129 --> 01:07:39.255
And that they are standing
in front of you,

01:07:39.298 --> 01:07:42.175
Shall we say, buck naked.

01:07:54.396 --> 01:07:57.106
Isn't that wild, folks?
Isn't that wild?

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:06.699
Gil, do you have a second?

01:08:06.742 --> 01:08:08.451
Look, this could not be going better.

01:08:08.494 --> 01:08:09.827
- Love it.
- We're really happy...

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:11.496
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:11.538 --> 01:08:14.081
These two people
will come backstage with me

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:17.001
To keep an eye on me to make sure
there's no funny business,

01:08:17.044 --> 01:08:21.214
And these two people
will hide my fee in cash

01:08:21.256 --> 01:08:24.216
Somewhere in this auditorium.

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:25.968
You have my fee.

01:08:26.011 --> 01:08:27.970
All right, shall we?

01:08:33.393 --> 01:08:35.978
Here we go. Man of the hour.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.856
Great job, Buck.
It's going great.

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:41.692
Hey, Buck,
let me ask you something.

01:08:41.734 --> 01:08:43.528
How do they work
this thing with your money?

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:44.904
What do you mean?

01:08:44.947 --> 01:08:48.282
I assume the casino pays you
by the month, right?

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:50.283
So is that a week's
worth of cash out there?

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:52.620
- Honey, shh.
- What? I'm curious.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.580
- Um...
- Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hi.

01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:57.250
I work for the casinos, sir,
and it's a good question.

01:08:57.292 --> 01:08:58.584
The agreement we have with Buck

01:08:58.627 --> 01:09:00.377
Is that if he's unable
to find the money,

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.671
A pro-Rated sum
for tonight's show only,

01:09:02.714 --> 01:09:05.508
It is deducted from his salary
and donated to charity.

01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:09.011
Boring!

01:09:09.054 --> 01:09:12.473
- They're ready for you.
- Mr. Howard...

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.850
- We're here to party.
- ...they're ready for you.

01:09:14.893 --> 01:09:17.770
- Gotta get out there!
- Go get 'em, Buck!

01:09:17.813 --> 01:09:20.106
As I went back
to watch him finish the show,

01:09:20.148 --> 01:09:23.568
I had this feeling that
it was time for me to move on.

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:27.488
I was Buck's road manager,
and his days on the road were over.

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:30.073
Now for this next effect

01:09:30.117 --> 01:09:32.535
I will need complete silence,

01:09:32.578 --> 01:09:36.205
Absolute concentration.
Thank you.

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:41.085
Two-Year deal. Buck did it.

01:09:41.127 --> 01:09:42.962
Yes, his show had changed...

01:09:43.005 --> 01:09:45.089
The doves, the scarves...

01:09:45.131 --> 01:09:47.841
But it seemed like Buck was okay
with these compromises.

01:09:50.178 --> 01:09:53.930
And despite it all,
his show still came down to this,

01:09:53.974 --> 01:09:55.933
His signature effect,

01:09:55.976 --> 01:09:58.019
The thing he had
always been known for.

01:10:13.035 --> 01:10:15.119
Gil, is he all right?

01:10:15.162 --> 01:10:17.038
Oh, just fine.

01:10:25.881 --> 01:10:29.342
But then, suddenly,

01:10:29.384 --> 01:10:33.596
For the first time
in a nearly 40-Year career,

01:10:36.767 --> 01:10:38.684
Buck couldn't find his money.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:49.570
And just like that, it was over.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.347
So here you are.

01:11:19.184 --> 01:11:21.602
What are you gonna do now, kid?

01:11:23.188 --> 01:11:26.482
Well, um,

01:11:26.525 --> 01:11:28.484
I've been doing some writing.

01:11:28.527 --> 01:11:31.862
Really?
Like for a newspaper?

01:11:31.905 --> 01:11:34.573
No, different kind of writing.

01:11:34.616 --> 01:11:38.744
Oh. You mean the kind
where they don't pay you.

01:11:38.787 --> 01:11:42.665
Well, I'm hoping eventually,
but so far, yeah.

01:11:42.708 --> 01:11:45.710
You don't remember because
you were a little kid.

01:11:45.752 --> 01:11:49.255
But your mom and I,
we barely made it in the beginning.

01:11:49.297 --> 01:11:51.966
- We struggled...
- So that I wouldn't have to.

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:54.176
Yes, I know.

01:11:54.219 --> 01:11:56.846
That's right.
But I didn't have a choice.

01:11:56.888 --> 01:11:58.055
You do.

01:11:58.098 --> 01:12:00.725
So, how about this...

01:12:00.767 --> 01:12:04.770
You come back home,
you save up your money,

01:12:04.813 --> 01:12:07.231
You go back to school...
hear me out, now,

01:12:07.274 --> 01:12:08.607
Just hear me out.

01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:10.776
Entertainment law.

01:12:10.819 --> 01:12:13.154
- Entertainment law.
- Dad, stop.

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:15.614
I wish I could
go back to school.

01:12:15.657 --> 01:12:19.118
I know that if I do,
I'd be set, but I can't.

01:12:19.161 --> 01:12:21.954
I have to try this.

01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:23.956
It might be a crazy dream.

01:12:23.999 --> 01:12:27.043
I might fail miserably,

01:12:27.085 --> 01:12:30.463
But I have to at least try.

01:12:30.505 --> 01:12:35.426
Otherwise, I'm not going
to be happy at anything.

01:12:40.182 --> 01:12:42.183
Okay.

01:12:44.102 --> 01:12:46.062
Good luck.

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:50.357
You are aware that the word
"writer" rarely appears

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.443
Without the word
"starving" in front of it.

01:12:54.112 --> 01:12:57.323
So you better finish
your breakfast.

01:12:57.365 --> 01:12:59.325
And then take me
to the airport.

01:12:59.367 --> 01:13:01.327
I gotta get out of Los Angeles.

01:13:03.914 --> 01:13:06.999
My dad was right.
I did need to make money.

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:08.793
But I had learned from Buck

01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:10.878
That when you do
the thing you love,

01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:15.800
Somehow, magically,
you find the money.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:27.686
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:27.729 --> 01:13:29.688
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:33.025
Wow, so yeah,
that's Jonathan Finerman.

01:13:33.068 --> 01:13:35.945
Yes, you remember him?
His show just got picked up

01:13:35.987 --> 01:13:37.655
And we've just been doing press
round the clock.

01:13:37.697 --> 01:13:40.533
I grew up watching him.
He was huge.

01:13:40.575 --> 01:13:42.785
But I still don't understand

01:13:42.828 --> 01:13:45.538
Why he would want
to meet with me.

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.166
The writer's assistant got fired,
and I just mentioned you.

01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:52.128
Troy, this could be
so great for you.

01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.130
Most of the assistants,
they make staff in like a year or two.

01:13:54.172 --> 01:13:56.048
It would be really good.

01:13:56.091 --> 01:13:59.510
I don't usually do this sort of thing,
but I had to meet you.

01:13:59.553 --> 01:14:02.638
You used to work
for Buck Howard.

01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:05.516
Yeah, I did.

01:14:05.559 --> 01:14:07.935
I've been a fan of his
ever since I was a kid.

01:14:07.978 --> 01:14:10.813
I also do a little
amateur magic myself.

01:14:10.856 --> 01:14:14.775
There's always been something
I've been curious about,

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:16.569
Not that it matters...

01:14:16.611 --> 01:14:18.154
I don't know how
he finds the money.

01:14:18.196 --> 01:14:20.364
That's not what
I was gonna ask.

01:14:20.407 --> 01:14:21.991
Is he gay?

01:14:22.033 --> 01:14:23.993
I'm just wondering.

01:14:24.035 --> 01:14:25.661
I don't know.

01:14:25.704 --> 01:14:29.248
I never saw him with anyone, so...

01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:31.458
Yeah, well...

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:34.378
The thing about the money,
I found that out. That's a total scam.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.715
Really? How?

01:14:37.757 --> 01:14:40.593
He wears an earpiece.

01:14:40.635 --> 01:14:42.970
I've heard about this.

01:14:43.013 --> 01:14:46.473
And there's a guy that travels with him
that tells him where the money is.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.517
I think I would have noticed.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.519
He travels separate.

01:14:50.562 --> 01:14:52.688
No one is even sure what
the guy looks like.

01:14:52.731 --> 01:14:54.106
He sees where the money is,

01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:56.775
Goes to the restroom
or out to his car...

01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:58.861
Only takes a second...

01:14:58.904 --> 01:15:02.072
Whispers into a microphone,
it goes right into Buck's ear.

01:15:02.115 --> 01:15:06.118
"Third row,
lady in the green sweater."

01:15:06.161 --> 01:15:08.495
And his job is done.

01:15:11.124 --> 01:15:13.167
No, I don't believe it.

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.463
You're loyal. I like that.

01:15:20.967 --> 01:15:24.303
Who would have thought
that Buck Howard on your resume

01:15:24.346 --> 01:15:26.472
- Would land you a job?
- Not me.

01:15:26.514 --> 01:15:28.891
And seriously,
thank you very much

01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:31.685
- For arranging this. It went very well.
- Come on.

01:15:31.728 --> 01:15:33.771
So, thank you. I mean it.

01:15:35.982 --> 01:15:39.693
Okay, well, I'm over here.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:45.741
So, that boyfriend of yours,
how's that working out?

01:15:45.784 --> 01:15:49.495
And you ask just because
you're concerned about my well-Being?

01:15:49.537 --> 01:15:52.122
Yes, of course.

01:15:52.165 --> 01:15:53.374
Of course
I'm very very concerned.

01:15:58.505 --> 01:15:59.880
I'll call you.

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.840
Okay.

01:16:03.176 --> 01:16:05.761
Preferably late at night, drunk.

01:16:05.804 --> 01:16:08.013
Always!

01:16:08.056 --> 01:16:10.557
Okay. Bye.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.228
And just like that,
I began a whole new life.

01:16:14.271 --> 01:16:17.982
Still, I thought
about Buck all the time.

01:16:18.024 --> 01:16:21.485
He had just disappeared
after that night in Vegas.

01:16:21.528 --> 01:16:25.197
I wondered what
exactly had gone wrong.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.033
Buck had never failed
to find his money before.

01:16:28.076 --> 01:16:30.035
It didn't make sense.

01:16:30.078 --> 01:16:32.830
But then again,
maybe it proved he was real.

01:16:32.872 --> 01:16:34.748
'Cause when you think about it,

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:38.502
Only something fake could
work 100% of the time.

01:16:38.545 --> 01:16:41.213
Regardless, I just wished there was
some way I could know that he was okay,

01:16:41.256 --> 01:16:44.967
Maybe talk to him one more time.

01:17:10.201 --> 01:17:11.744
Come in.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:21.462
- Hey, Buck.
- Troy! My goodness!

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:25.841
- How are you?
- I brought you something.

01:17:25.884 --> 01:17:29.303
Look at that. Brandy.
That's very kind of you.

01:17:29.346 --> 01:17:31.305
What are you doing here?

01:17:31.348 --> 01:17:33.891
Just thought I'd take a trip up,
check out the show.

01:17:33.933 --> 01:17:36.435
Come in.

01:17:36.478 --> 01:17:37.728
Buck, it's 30 minutes to showtime.

01:17:37.771 --> 01:17:40.356
Troy, this is Russell,
my new road manager.

01:17:40.398 --> 01:17:43.859
Russell, Troy used to have yourjob,
but Troy understood

01:17:43.902 --> 01:17:46.570
The importance of not looking
like a bum on the job.

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:49.531
Your tie.

01:17:49.574 --> 01:17:51.742
You're not in a bar.

01:17:51.785 --> 01:17:54.578
Come back when it's five minutes
and I need some water.

01:17:54.621 --> 01:17:56.580
Actually, there is
some water right there.

01:17:56.623 --> 01:17:58.582
That's distilled water.
I'm not an iron.

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:01.794
I drink spring water, remember?

01:18:01.836 --> 01:18:03.962
Thank you.

01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:10.052
So, you've come out of retirement.

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:12.971
Oh, I'll never give up, Troy.

01:18:15.016 --> 01:18:17.476
So, why are you here?

01:18:20.355 --> 01:18:22.356
What happened in Vegas?

01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:24.650
Did you blow it on purpose?

01:18:24.692 --> 01:18:27.653
Because that is the only explanation
that I can think of.

01:18:27.695 --> 01:18:29.655
I know you wear an earpiece

01:18:29.697 --> 01:18:33.659
And you have someone
in the audience

01:18:33.701 --> 01:18:35.619
Who tells you
where the money is.

01:18:35.662 --> 01:18:39.665
Troy, that thing about the earpiece
has been going around for years.

01:18:39.707 --> 01:18:41.083
It's a rumor.
Do you want to check?

01:18:41.126 --> 01:18:43.210
No, it doesn't matter.

01:18:43.253 --> 01:18:44.461
It's not important.

01:18:44.504 --> 01:18:46.713
Look, I get it. It is a show.

01:18:46.756 --> 01:18:48.006
You are there to entertain.

01:18:48.049 --> 01:18:50.008
I understand.

01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:52.511
I just want to know,
for myself.

01:18:52.554 --> 01:18:55.180
What happened in Vegas?

01:18:56.724 --> 01:19:00.602
You know, I don't really belong

01:19:00.645 --> 01:19:02.604
In Vegas anymore.

01:19:02.647 --> 01:19:05.357
I belong in places like these.

01:19:06.734 --> 01:19:10.737
I love what I do.
I love these towns.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.906
I love these people.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:15.659
And I would never
cheat them, ever.

01:19:18.246 --> 01:19:20.622
Watch the show tonight.

01:19:23.251 --> 01:19:26.545
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:26.588 --> 01:19:30.757
I can't tell you how delighted
I am to be back in Bakersfield.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.843
I love this town!

01:19:32.886 --> 01:19:35.179
As I settled in
to watch Buck's show,

01:19:35.221 --> 01:19:37.473
It struck me

01:19:37.515 --> 01:19:39.850
This was the first time
I was seeing it as an audience member.

01:19:39.893 --> 01:19:42.895
I want you to take
this piece of paper...

01:19:42.937 --> 01:19:44.646
And it was his old show.

01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:46.690
The changes he had made
in Vegas were gone

01:19:46.733 --> 01:19:48.025
As if they had never happened.

01:19:48.067 --> 01:19:50.694
And somehow it felt right.

01:19:50.737 --> 01:19:52.696
It was actually kind of
beautiful in a way.

01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:54.573
...because I know
what the number is.

01:19:54.616 --> 01:19:57.326
The number you have
written down is the number 77.

01:19:57.368 --> 01:19:59.077
Is that correct?

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.746
Show the audience.

01:20:00.788 --> 01:20:02.080
Isn't that wild?

01:20:02.123 --> 01:20:06.001
What the world needs now

01:20:06.044 --> 01:20:08.587
Is love, sweet love...

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:12.341
When I tap them
on their left shoulder,

01:20:12.383 --> 01:20:17.095
They will be sound asleep
in their chairs.

01:20:17.138 --> 01:20:21.016
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...

01:20:21.059 --> 01:20:25.270
Humpty Dumpty had
a great fall...

01:20:27.232 --> 01:20:28.982
As the show neared its finale,

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:32.236
I saw that Buck had actually
made one small change.

01:20:32.278 --> 01:20:34.238
And this one was just for me.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.115
For many years
there have been rumors

01:20:37.158 --> 01:20:40.827
That I employ some sort
of listening device

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.080
To aid me with this effect.

01:20:43.122 --> 01:20:46.625
I would like to address
those rumors tonight.

01:20:46.668 --> 01:20:49.044
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:20:49.087 --> 01:20:50.837
Oh, there are two.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.173
May I ask you both to come
onstage, please?

01:20:55.635 --> 01:20:58.971
Take these instruments.
Please look in my ears

01:20:59.013 --> 01:21:02.140
And tell the public
if I have any kind

01:21:02.183 --> 01:21:05.018
Of listening device whatsoever.

01:21:07.397 --> 01:21:08.939
It's all clear.

01:21:08.982 --> 01:21:10.732
Thank you.

01:21:10.775 --> 01:21:12.818
Now, to convince

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.863
Even the most hardened skeptics,

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:21.326
I will also put
this hood over my head.

01:21:21.369 --> 01:21:24.329
I will ask you all to clap in unison

01:21:24.372 --> 01:21:27.833
While my fee is being rehidden

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:30.669
Here in the auditorium.

01:21:30.712 --> 01:21:33.922
And I am ready.

01:21:51.316 --> 01:21:52.899
They're done.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.526
Thank you.

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:58.447
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the public,

01:21:58.489 --> 01:22:02.117
I may have to inconvenience you
one more time.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.038
I must have, please,
for this effect, complete silence.

01:23:11.396 --> 01:23:13.855
I couldn't watch because I knew

01:23:13.898 --> 01:23:16.942
Buck wasn't going
to find the money.

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:24.074
I could only guess

01:23:24.117 --> 01:23:26.618
That whatever Buck
had used in the past,

01:23:26.661 --> 01:23:31.289
Whether it was an earpiece
or his own powers,

01:23:31.332 --> 01:23:33.333
It was gone now.

01:23:35.086 --> 01:23:37.629
And for the first time, I realized

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:40.924
I wanted to believe
that Buck would always be out there,

01:23:40.967 --> 01:23:43.635
In some small town somewhere,

01:23:43.678 --> 01:23:46.888
Showing people that
the impossible was possible,

01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:49.808
That there was magic in this world.

01:23:49.851 --> 01:23:52.477
But that wasn't meant to be.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.982
This time it was
really over for Buck.

01:24:04.866 --> 01:24:08.869
- Sir, you have the money.
- I'm sorry. I don't have it.

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:13.123
Sir, you have the money
in your left pocket.

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:51.536
I love this town!
