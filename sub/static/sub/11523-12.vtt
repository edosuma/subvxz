WEBVTT

00:07.298 --> 00:08.842
My mother's dead!

00:08.925 --> 00:10.010
She's dead!

00:11.219 --> 00:12.470
But that's <i>Bambi.</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:13.972
I got off on a tangent.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.724
You asked about my mom.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.935
Lori-Ann Schmidt.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.646
Well, she was fun.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.607
She wore tube tops, tube bottoms,
tube socks.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.276
The only hot breakfast I ever got

00:26.359 --> 00:29.446
was the morning she crashed our house
into a Denny's.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.489
But the thing that really
raisined my cookie

00:31.573 --> 00:32.573
was her addiction.

00:32.656 --> 00:33.575
Bah, I knew it!

00:33.658 --> 00:34.576
What was it? Pills?

00:34.659 --> 00:35.994
No, more dirtbaggy.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.913
Underdeveloped ears,
facial trapezoidism...

00:38.997 --> 00:39.831
huffing.

00:39.914 --> 00:40.999
Roller coasters.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.001
- What now?
- My mom's a coasterhead.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.044
She's addicted to riding roller coasters.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.880
She what?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.298
That is dumb!

00:49.466 --> 00:52.177
I mean, would you care tlaborade?

00:52.260 --> 00:54.220
O.M. gosh.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.473
Dr. Bayden, have you been day-drinking?

00:56.556 --> 00:59.142
No, this is tea.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.813
That's not okay.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.315
Fine, whatever.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.734
I'm better at this when I drink.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.029
It's like playing darts
or driving a Zamboni

01:11.112 --> 01:14.240
or running away from a Zamboni
you can't stop.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.869
Hey, who breakthroughed you
on that mom stuff?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.538
Not Joggy McExercise here.

01:21.581 --> 01:26.211
And if it makes you feel better,
I can still say things like,

01:26.294 --> 01:28.505
"How has your relationship
with your mother

01:28.588 --> 01:30.423
affected your current relationships?"

01:30.507 --> 01:33.218
Boo-ya!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.388
Look, Ahn-drea...

01:37.472 --> 01:38.640
Ugh, I'm not British.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.808
It's Ann-drea.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.726
I grew up in Metuchen.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.727
Exit ten!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.604
Go, Bulldogs!

01:44.687 --> 01:45.605
That's our time,

01:45.688 --> 01:47.941
and I think we've made
some really good progress today.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.193
So enough talking.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.736
You're coming out with me!

01:51.820 --> 01:53.279
No, I have to work tonight.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.280
Perfect,

01:54.364 --> 01:57.617
'cause you just accepted my ride.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.701
That's mine!

01:58.785 --> 01:59.953
When did you take that?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.788
I don't remember.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.574

02:37.657 --> 02:40.118
My penis infection spread to my face.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.828
Just picking up my last paycheck.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.330
Ugh, Titus, I envy you.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.166
I wish I had the courage to quit.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.167
Quitters are America's unsung heroes.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.331
Without us, we'd probably still
be going to the moon.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.880
It's just rocks, Rick.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.716
We got plenty of rocks down here.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.260
And there's so much production
in New York right now.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.803
That must be great for you.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.804
It's amazing.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.473
All that free food if you just pretend
you're part of the crew?

03:02.557 --> 03:05.143
No, I mean, you must be auditioning
like crazy.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.313
I've been busy.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.565
You know, getting my 14 hours every night

03:10.648 --> 03:12.358
and going to the <i>Jim...</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:14.277
<i>Gaffigan Show </i> craft service table.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.904
Titus, you've got to get out there.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.740
Tomorrow there's an open call
for a musical production

03:18.823 --> 03:20.742
of <i>Mahogany </i> starring Dionne Warwick.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.659
What?

03:21.743 --> 03:24.287
Why didn't her psychic network tell me
that was coming?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.789
I spoke to them yesterday,
and all they said was,

03:26.873 --> 03:30.710
someone with a letter in their name
would tell me something.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.337
Your name has letters.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.015
Kimmy, five stars, picking up Russ.

03:45.683 --> 03:46.768
Kimmy?

03:46.851 --> 03:47.953
Since when do you have red hair?

03:47.977 --> 03:51.189
Jacqueline? But you're going by Russ?

03:51.272 --> 03:54.150
Someone just put the "neato"
in "incognito"!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.610
I didn't order the car.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.363
Russ is the man
I've spent the past few weeks pursuing.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.240
He's just finishing up a phone call.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.034
No, no, no, Jerry, you push those people
out of their homes,

04:03.117 --> 04:06.120
I'll push your wife's wedding ring
out of my ass!

04:06.204 --> 04:07.914
Wow.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.832
He knows someone named Jerry.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.626
You think I don't know he's disgusting?

04:11.709 --> 04:12.835
Well, you're the reason

04:12.919 --> 04:14.963
I'm with a bald pro bono
property rights lawyer

04:15.046 --> 04:16.589
and his BlackBerry.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.132
Me? What did I do?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.593
You tricked me into thinking
I could be a better person,

04:20.677 --> 04:22.804
and now I'm completely broke.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.390
I need that walking trust fund
to put a baby in me

04:25.473 --> 04:26.891
before it has a heart attack.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.975
Seriously?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.536
So you're right back where you started.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.996
Oh, I don't want to hear it from you.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.106
I finally have Russ to myself for a night.

04:33.189 --> 04:37.110
We're going to his hotel room,
and I'm gonna seal the deal.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.111
Ugh.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.905
I hope he's one of those Jews
who does it through a sheet.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.907
Not so tough now, are you, Grandma?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.076
Who is that?

04:45.159 --> 04:46.577
Is she prettier than me?

04:50.748 --> 04:53.418
I love how sweaty you get doing your job.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.101
It's like you're a professional athlete.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.922
Oh, it's the developer
calling from Moscow.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.341
Oh, my God.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.969
You're hilarious.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.264
Hello, Dimitri.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.933
Let me start by saying

05:09.017 --> 05:12.729
your people murdered my grandparents.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.607
I think your fever broke.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.692
Thank God.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.402
I was hallucinating last night.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.279
I don't say this enough,

05:21.362 --> 05:24.324
but I'm really glad
you're not a giant crab.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.451
Oh.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.453
I should have been a doctor.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.831
I look amazing in white,
my handwriting is terrible,

05:31.914 --> 05:33.892
and I love telling people
to take their pants off and just leaving

05:33.916 --> 05:35.835
and then making them sit there
for an hour.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.509
Maybe this is why I haven't been thinking
about work.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.803
I'd rather be with you.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.614
And when you were away
at that construction convention,

05:47.638 --> 05:48.931
I was just too sad to sing.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.852
ConCon is usually so fun,
but I was away from you,

05:52.935 --> 05:56.105
and Tony DaGrammo
wore the same costume as me.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.441
Tony DaGrammo was silicone joint sealant?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.442
That bitch.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.651
He did it on purpose.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.570
You got an audition tomorrow.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.714
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

06:03.738 --> 06:06.157
Mm, but Titus likes it here.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.658
I don't want to get you sick, bro.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.869
Fine.

06:09.952 --> 06:14.665
But FYI,
I only get sick on the dance floor.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.627
Because the flashing lights
and the spinning.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.723
- Shall we order champagne?
- Jacqueline!

06:30.807 --> 06:33.267
You followed me to my hotel room.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.185
Wow.

06:34.268 --> 06:38.356
Russ, I know
your phone is fascinating, but...

06:38.439 --> 06:39.816
what about these?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.109
I, uh...

06:41.984 --> 06:44.737
All right, thank you so much,
but please don't do that.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.114
Oh, sorry.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.824
That was my ex-husband's thing.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.450
Look, Jacqueline, I had fun tonight,

06:49.534 --> 06:50.743
I really did, and I'm sorry

06:50.827 --> 06:52.203
I was on the phone so much.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.248
Well, we're here now,
and that room has a bed.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.334
For sleeping or porking.

06:58.417 --> 07:02.088
Believe me, there's nothing more
I'd like to do.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.925
Your lady parts are...

07:06.008 --> 07:07.635
top-notch.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.763
I'm not great with women.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.225
I find that they tend to only
be interested in my money.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.811
Well, obviously that's not the case
with me.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.480
I gave away a $12 million painting
without a fight.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.149
And you saw my apartment.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.835
Yeah, it looked like you were moving out.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.360
I was moving in.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.820
You should see it all finished.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.363
I have a hundred chairs!

07:27.447 --> 07:29.574
I'm sorry, I've been burned before.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.784
And I was recently engaged
to what turned out

07:31.868 --> 07:35.037
to be a hologram
controlled by a Turkish hacker.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.665
I just need to take it slow.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.840
G'day, mate. It's Russ, you know.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.635
Right. Oh, crikey!

07:49.719 --> 07:51.488
You call that a knife?

07:51.512 --> 07:54.682
Outback Steakhouse? All right, then.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.812
Good morning, Andrea.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.772
Oh, God, was that your bed?

08:04.108 --> 08:05.985
Do you by any chance know where I put

08:06.068 --> 08:08.988
my keys, phone, shoes, or NuvaRing?

08:09.071 --> 08:12.325
Well, I know you threw your keys
in the river to protest racism.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.635
That's why I brought you back here.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.580
Kimmy, I am so sorry that you got dragged

08:17.663 --> 08:19.790
into Night Andrea's idiocy again.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.709
Yeah, it wasn't entirely a night thing.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.295
You were already drunk
during our session yesterday.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.590
Damn it!

08:27.673 --> 08:29.926
I run marathons.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.009
I went to medical school.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.428
I speak fluent Italian.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.971
You do?

08:34.054 --> 08:34.972
Explain this.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.807
They're the Mario brothers, right?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.768
But one of them is named Mario.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.852
Does that mean his name is Mario Mario?

08:40.937 --> 08:43.981
Why can't I hold it together?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.274
I'm gonna have to go away.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.401
- Where?
- To a conference.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.570
"Conference" is therapist code for rehab.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.906
Like how, "Oh, interesting, go on,"

08:51.989 --> 08:54.200
is code for,
"I hate you and your stupid life."

08:54.283 --> 08:55.201
How long will you be gone?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.620
A while, because it's not just rehab.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.747
First there's the bender, then rehab,

08:59.830 --> 09:01.791
then getting kicked out of rehab for

09:01.874 --> 09:03.751
"using sex and threats of violence

09:03.834 --> 09:05.670
to obtain cooking wine,"

09:05.753 --> 09:07.797
then more drinking,
back into a different rehab,

09:07.880 --> 09:09.423
and finally a two-week surf camp

09:09.507 --> 09:11.342
with a bunch of recent divorcées.

09:11.425 --> 09:12.718
It's a process.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.863
You're the one who said
I have a fear of abandonment,

09:14.887 --> 09:16.514
and now you're just gonna leave me?

09:16.597 --> 09:18.432
We haven't even gotten to my fear
of Velcro!

09:18.516 --> 09:19.850
You're afraid of...

09:20.685 --> 09:21.602
Nope.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.188
I will refer you to a colleague,
and the two of you...

09:24.272 --> 09:26.482
No, I'm not starting over.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.834
Maybe there's something I can do.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.902
I said I was gonna help you too,

09:29.986 --> 09:32.655
but all I've done so far
is talk about myself.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.907
So let's fix you.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.617
Why'd you start drinking yesterday?

09:36.701 --> 09:39.078
No, I am not getting into this with you.

09:39.161 --> 09:40.389
I have got to start wrapping things up

09:40.413 --> 09:41.789
with my other patients,

09:41.872 --> 09:44.041
and then it's bender time.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.270
Winter is tricky,
because if you pass out in a snowbank,

09:46.294 --> 09:47.628
you lose another toe.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.930
Um, Titus, are you feeling okay?

09:58.014 --> 10:00.016
Five, six, seven, eight!

10:00.099 --> 10:02.602

10:02.685 --> 10:05.187

10:28.836 --> 10:30.338
Trident!

10:32.590 --> 10:35.301
In lieu of my usual audition piece,

10:35.384 --> 10:37.928
that was a jingle for gum I just made up.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.977
Well, that was my worst audition ever.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.062
Nope.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.565
You said this was blanks!

10:49.649 --> 10:50.983
There he is!

10:51.067 --> 10:54.028
Titus Andromedon!

10:54.111 --> 10:56.030
Hello, Norman.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.114
What are you here for,

10:57.198 --> 10:58.491
the elder abuse PSA?

10:58.574 --> 10:59.784
Listen to this:

10:59.867 --> 11:03.245
No!

11:04.455 --> 11:08.417
Norman, I just had
the second worst audition of my life.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.418
Third.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.022
I forgot about the one that turned out
to be a Japanese prank show

11:12.046 --> 11:13.881
and they shot me into the ocean
on a toilet.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.008
Well, keep your head up, son.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.428
Me, 50 years in the biz, best year ever.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.056
I played another <i>Law & Order </i> corpse.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.599
Faceup this time.

11:23.682 --> 11:27.395
And I almost got
Man Struggling With Regular Pot

11:27.478 --> 11:28.813
in an infomercial.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.606
Oh, my God.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.526
Hey, do you have a head shot on you?

11:33.609 --> 11:35.986
My improv team is looking
for a second person.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.906
Sir, I am sick, and you mention improv?

11:38.989 --> 11:43.744
Hey, if you hear about anything
I'd be good for,

11:43.828 --> 11:45.079
you pass this along.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.748
And I'll do the same for you.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.210
You'll notice one of my special skills

11:51.293 --> 11:55.089
is ending conversations, so...

11:59.260 --> 12:00.678
Lillian! How was the bulldozer?

12:00.761 --> 12:02.388
Oh, terrible.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.474
Turns out, the way I was handcuffed to it

12:05.558 --> 12:08.519
didn't actually stop anybody
from using it.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.439
Come on, I'm trying to take a nap!

12:11.522 --> 12:13.649
So as soon as I pooped out the key,

12:13.732 --> 12:14.775
I hit the bricks.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.944
What a disaster!

12:17.027 --> 12:20.406
Boy, you're probably in a rush
to shower, huh?

12:20.489 --> 12:22.408
Not so much.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
What are you whoring up for?

12:24.452 --> 12:27.371
I have a plan
to stop my therapist from drinking,

12:27.455 --> 12:29.790
and it starts with getting her drunk.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.834
All good plans do.

12:32.543 --> 12:36.005
Cough, sniffle, sneeze.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.506
Oh, no.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.924
Are you sick?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.593
Mikey was sick, so I took care of him,

12:40.676 --> 12:42.428
even though I had an audition.

12:42.511 --> 12:43.971
What was I thinking?

12:44.054 --> 12:46.724
Kimmy, where have you been?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.702
I need your help,
and I deleted your phone number

12:48.726 --> 12:49.727
when I was mad at you.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.410
You know, before I went into the bunker,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.314
people knew each other's phone numbers.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.398
Thanks, cell phones!

12:54.482 --> 12:56.901
Eh, not your best observation, dear.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.360
C-plus.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.447
Last night, Russ didn't want
to have sex with me.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.615
Gasp, he must be gay.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.033
It's because you're too pretty.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.409
Believe me, I get it.

13:05.493 --> 13:09.413
But like you,
Russ is a sexually inexperienced

13:09.497 --> 13:11.665
do-gooder weirdo with the fashion sense

13:11.749 --> 13:13.250
of a Canadian child.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.961
So I need you to help me figure out
what he wants.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.547
Or you could stop trying
to mack out with him.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.882
You don't even like that guy.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.383
Hold on.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.968
What was his excuse?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.052
Tired?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.262
Married?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.264
We're on a school bus, Lillian?

13:27.348 --> 13:29.558
He said he's been burned before.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.101
He wants to take it slow.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.436
I don't have time for slow.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.521
I'm out of money!

13:33.604 --> 13:36.899
Honey, if a man wants to take things slow,

13:36.982 --> 13:39.443
he's either getting over an infection

13:39.527 --> 13:40.778
or looking for love.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.613
You know, Dong and I...

13:42.696 --> 13:44.657
The grown-ups are talking, sweetie.

13:44.740 --> 13:48.035
So I have to make him
genuinely fall in love with me?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.286
I've never done that.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.539
I've had many men love me,

13:51.622 --> 13:54.542
and you know when I knew they were goners?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.795
When my needs were more important to them

13:57.878 --> 13:59.838
than any of their crap.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.341
Titus has joined the conversation.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.342
Who?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.052
That's exactly what happened with Mikey.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.555
He needed me to take care of him,
and I did,

14:07.638 --> 14:08.973
even though it made no sense,

14:09.056 --> 14:11.308
like wearing pants in your own home.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.352
That's how it happens.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.938
So I need to make Russ think
that I'm more important

14:16.021 --> 14:17.690
than whatever he cares about.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.358
His work, I guess.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.152
But if I could just get him off the phone
for five minutes,

14:22.236 --> 14:25.090
he'd see that there's something far more
interesting right in front of him!

14:25.114 --> 14:27.116
Well, of course he will. You're amazing.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.367
Have you lost weight?

14:28.450 --> 14:31.495
All right, enough already.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.164
Achoo.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.839
Kimmy!

14:41.922 --> 14:43.007
Whazzaaap?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.926
You don't have appointment

14:46.010 --> 14:47.928
to shrink that big old head.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.763
So wide!

14:49.847 --> 14:51.181
No, I'm just playing.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.058
It is pretty big, though.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.727
What, you think I'm dressed to talk?

14:54.810 --> 14:58.689
I'm dressed to party hearty
like an MC Skat Kat.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.482
You know where is it a cat?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.026
I heard about an alcohol bash.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.987
It's supposed to be a real sausage fest.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.470
Don't know if that's up your alley.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.865
It's gonna be!

15:07.948 --> 15:08.866
Get my coat.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.075
Get my coat!

15:10.159 --> 15:11.201
Wait, also get my coat.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.929
And then come through the doors
and follow me,

15:12.953 --> 15:14.330
but then get in front,

15:14.413 --> 15:16.081
'cause you know where we're going.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.255
Okay.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.590
I can work with this.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.009
Cheers.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.745
You know who would hate this place?

15:36.769 --> 15:37.686
Ahn-drea.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.063
She's so lame.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.273
- Oh, she sucks.
- I know.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.525
She rolls total dice.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.654
So what makes her decide to start drinking
and get so cool?

15:46.737 --> 15:48.697
Bitch can't handle eating alone

15:48.781 --> 15:50.783
because of her dumb childhood.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.619
And lately,
she can't even wait until dinner.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.537
The other day at lunch, she was all,

15:55.621 --> 15:58.791
"I'll just have one glass of Sancerre
with my shrimp salad."

15:58.874 --> 16:02.336
Before you know it,
I'm there with the three Bs:

16:02.419 --> 16:07.383
bourbon, burgers, busboys,
comma, getting high with.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.093
So it starts at lunch.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.595
- What time does she...
- Oh, boo!

16:11.679 --> 16:14.181
You're not trolling for Polish D at all!

16:14.264 --> 16:16.934
You just want to figure out
why I start drinking

16:17.017 --> 16:18.894
so you can try to get me to stop.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.813
No, I'm here to party.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.982
Watch this.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.234
"Hello, is hot dog there?"

16:25.317 --> 16:27.069
That kind of thing. Yow!

16:27.152 --> 16:28.904
You think people
haven't tried this before?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.864
I can't be stopped.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.866
One time, to get white wine,

16:32.950 --> 16:36.286
I listened to B.J. Novak
do a book reading.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.705
Can't be stopped?

16:37.788 --> 16:39.348
You don't know who you're dealing with.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.709
Whom. And it's already too late.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.585
I'm sending you back to the night.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.878
It's not gonna work.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.132
She can't get through one day
without drinking.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.800
We'll see about that.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.557
Yeah, breaking stuff.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.766
That's you guys, right?

17:01.395 --> 17:03.689
Just when I thought my audition
couldn't get any worse,

17:03.772 --> 17:05.357
I run into Norman Gordon.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.441
Who's Norman Gordon?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.359
The ghost of Titus Future.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.905
I've seen that sad old man
at every audition I've ever been to.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.034
And the only speaking role he ever got
was Corpse Emitting Gases

17:15.117 --> 17:17.703
on <i>Law & Order: Drifter Incineration Squad.</i>

17:17.786 --> 17:20.830
That's the one where Liev Schreiber
plays twins, right?

17:20.914 --> 17:23.000
He's been acting for 50 years,

17:23.083 --> 17:24.626
and he's got nothing to show for it.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.877
Is that gonna be me?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.881
Why should I keep humiliating myself
at auditions

17:27.963 --> 17:30.549
for parts like Off-Camera Loser
and Urban Farter

17:30.632 --> 17:32.468
when I'd rather be at home
feeding you soup?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.987
I do like how you do spoon airplane.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.220
You don't dumb it down.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.390
Look, if you're unhappy,
maybe you don't have to work.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.850
I make good money.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.351
Yesterday I got time and a half

17:41.435 --> 17:43.155
for being sick
during <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

17:43.187 --> 17:45.814
And my lease is up

17:45.898 --> 17:48.776
at the end of the month, so...

17:48.859 --> 17:50.819
maybe I move in with you.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.365
Wow.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.868
That's a big step,
and you know how I feel about steps.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.495
I do. You're against them.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.164
But what do you say?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.423
Andromedon Productions.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.426
You can't spell our name without "drama"
if you spell it wrong.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.803
How may I direct your call?

18:15.886 --> 18:17.054
This is Kurt Liebestod.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.056
I'm calling from
the Medical Examiner's Office.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.558
Please hold.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.894
<i>♪ Outside bones, outside bones ♪</i>

18:23.977 --> 18:27.272
<i>♪ Your teeth are your skeleton escaping ♪</i>

18:27.356 --> 18:28.607
You're on with Titus.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.944
Mr. Andromedon, do you know a corpse
named Norman Gordon?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.321
Come on, Kurt. Don't lead with "corpse."

18:34.404 --> 18:36.824
Wait, what are you saying?

18:36.907 --> 18:37.908
Is Norman dead?

18:37.991 --> 18:39.284
<i>He passed away earlier today</i>

18:39.368 --> 18:41.578
during a Level One improv class.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.502
<i>We haven't been able to locate
any next of kin,</i>

18:43.580 --> 18:46.041
but your phone number
was in his personal effects.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.210
If you'd like to pay your respects,

18:48.293 --> 18:50.921
we'll be throwing him in the East River
this afternoon.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.173
What happened?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.633
You okay?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.886
Let's move in together.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.722
Uh-uh.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.059
No, Verizon cannot turn homeless people
into walking cell phone towers.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.060
Russ, hang up.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.438
It's such a beautiful day,
and the view is amazing.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.606
Ow!

19:09.690 --> 19:11.984
That really hurt.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.236
Yeah, listen, pal, the next call I make

19:14.319 --> 19:16.572
is gonna be to my good friend Tom Wheeler,

19:16.655 --> 19:18.365
the chairman of the FCC.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.617
Uh, well,
we take swimming lessons together,

19:20.701 --> 19:23.453
so just try... Hello?

19:23.537 --> 19:25.164
Did they just shut my service off?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.667
Sons of bitches!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.794
My 'Berry!

19:30.878 --> 19:33.630
Well, now that it's just the two of us,

19:33.714 --> 19:35.507
maybe we can go rent a rowboat.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.925
You think I'm ready for rowboats?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.927
Tom Wheeler and I still use floaties.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.512
I got to get to the hotel.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.269
Off to lunch, are we?

19:47.352 --> 19:50.981
They say it's the third most important
meal of the day.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.816
Kimmy, what are you doing here?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.651
Good, you don't remember.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.070
I'm here to stop you from drinking today.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.405
Kimmy, I am not going to...

19:58.488 --> 20:00.115
- Sneak attack!
- What?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.951
How are you so strong?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.204
Oh, right, the bunker, the crank,

20:05.287 --> 20:07.039
being a chair, fighting off a reverend

20:07.122 --> 20:08.922
who's practicing cocaine-fueled karate
on you.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.293
We are going to stay up here
until the sun goes down.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.378
If you don't drink today, she loses,

20:13.462 --> 20:15.380
and that means you don't have
to go on a bender.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.233
It's not like when you say "Bloody Mary"
three times

20:17.257 --> 20:18.800
and she has to appear.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.764
Why would you say "Bloody Mary"
to an alcoholic?

20:20.844 --> 20:23.013
Andrea, stop, that's twice!

20:23.096 --> 20:25.349
Oh, this is just making me
want to drink more.

20:27.059 --> 20:27.976
I get it.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.437
You use alcohol
to make the bad stuff go away,

20:30.520 --> 20:32.731
but you don't need alcohol to do that.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.316
For 15 years, I did it

20:34.399 --> 20:36.360
just by keeping my brain too busy
to think.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.945
Among the techniques I used:

20:38.028 --> 20:40.197
staring contest!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.281
I win.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.574
I win.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.534
I win. I win.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.827
Wow, you're bad at this!

20:45.911 --> 20:47.371
- Bloody Mary.
- Ah, no!

20:47.454 --> 20:48.455
I win.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.459
Go. I win.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.627
I win.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.713
I can't run any farther.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.342
I have a third nipple.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.865
It's on the bottom of my right foot,

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
and it's killing me.

21:03.553 --> 21:04.888
All right, let me use your phone.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.641
Russ, you can't worry about
everyone else's problems all the time.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.393
It's turning your hair gray.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.272
Mm, your beard is so damp.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.749
Okay, just let me use your damn phone!

21:14.773 --> 21:16.066
God.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.402
Sorry. Sorry, that was rude.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.196
My mother would have put me in the freezer
for that one.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.949
Can't you just live in the moment
for once?

21:24.032 --> 21:25.659
I want to see you smile.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.998
There it is.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.541
It's neat.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.254
Look, I'm not making excuses
for my behavior,

21:37.337 --> 21:41.925
but when I was a kid,
I had a terrible stutter,

21:42.009 --> 21:45.304
so I didn't really talk to anyone,

21:45.387 --> 21:46.596
except for my pets.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.724
I had a hamster and a turtle,

21:48.807 --> 21:52.853
a parrot that I taught to say,
"Russ is cool."

21:52.936 --> 21:54.730
I loved those animals.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.649
And I swore that if I ever found my voice,

21:57.733 --> 22:00.652
I would dedicate my life
to speaking for them,

22:00.736 --> 22:01.820
the voiceless,

22:01.903 --> 22:04.489
whether it's lab animals

22:04.573 --> 22:06.491
or the one woman
who works at Goldman Sachs

22:06.575 --> 22:08.785
or the other members of Coldplay.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.498
Look, Jacqueline, I get it.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.126
I'm not always fun to be around.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.546
I can be loud and abrasive,
and my breath...

22:19.629 --> 22:22.632
The doctors say
I have incurable stinktongue.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.218
But I don't care
what other people think of me

22:25.302 --> 22:27.888
as long as they listen
to what I have to say.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.405
I'd like to thank all of you
for coming here

22:45.489 --> 22:50.368
to celebrate the life
of a very special victim indeed.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.664
Who are all these people?

22:54.748 --> 22:55.665
Is that Ice-T?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.626
Now, we've all worked with Norman.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.587
The makeup artists
who had us all truly believe

23:00.670 --> 23:03.423
that his genitals were stolen
by some weird dentist.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.177
The prop guy
who thought Norman was a mannequin

23:07.260 --> 23:09.346
and locked him in a closet over Christmas.

23:09.429 --> 23:15.185
His improv classmates
who yes-anded his final words:

23:15.268 --> 23:20.065
"Well, Hillary Clinton,
here we are at IKEA.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.818
Oh, God, my arm's numb.

23:22.901 --> 23:23.985
My bowels!"

23:25.153 --> 23:28.031
Norman Gordon may not be a household name,

23:28.115 --> 23:29.449
but that doesn't matter.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.701
What matters is, he followed his dream

23:31.785 --> 23:34.037
and lived life without regret.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.664
He didn't drive a fancy car

23:35.747 --> 23:38.708
or have an address
where he could receive mail,

23:38.792 --> 23:40.961
but he was a success

23:41.044 --> 23:43.547
because he was to his own self true,

23:43.630 --> 23:48.885
and in that way, he lives forever.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.699
I can't remember the last time
I rode the subway.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.619
Thank you for trying to stop
that horrible break-dancing panhandler.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.621
That man was having a seizure, Jacqueline.

24:16.705 --> 24:20.083
Ow, my fipple is either bleeding,
or it's lactating,

24:20.167 --> 24:24.504
but either way, my sock is soaked.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.257
When can we do this again?

24:27.340 --> 24:29.050
I'm just around the corner
from your hotel.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.553
Well, hello,
Just Around the Corner From Your Hotel.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.905
My name's Russ. Pleased to meet you.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.309
- Knockout game!
- Oh!

24:37.392 --> 24:38.476
- Ow!
- He didn't go down.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.603
Elana, you try.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.330
- His head is perfect.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.565
Look, I know you're acting out,

24:43.648 --> 24:45.609
but it's probably just problems at home.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.003
What did you say about our homes?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.296
Oh, I didn't... No, no! No, wait!

24:48.320 --> 24:50.155
I have a first aid kit in the bathroom.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.740
Oh, God, they're back!

24:51.823 --> 24:52.657
- How did they get here?
- No, no.

24:52.741 --> 24:53.801
- No, no.
- Did you invite them?

24:53.825 --> 24:55.243
Oh, God.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.286
Okay, lay down.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.537
Oh, all right.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.501
I was a flight attendant,
so I know first aid

25:03.585 --> 25:06.838
and how to catch Gérard Depardieu's urine
in an ice bucket.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.426
Mm-hmm.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.720
Is this your bedroom?

25:13.803 --> 25:16.806
You sleep on an air bed?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.850
Oh, you've lost a lot of blood.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.311
You're having trouble
identifying beds properly.

25:21.394 --> 25:24.940
I need to cover your eyes
in case you have a concussion.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.609
I'll have one of my servants
call you an ambulance.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.653
Gustav?

25:29.736 --> 25:33.281
Uh, yes, Miss Jacqweeleen?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.492
Call an ambulance, Gustav!

25:38.620 --> 25:41.164
Hi, Gustav, Russ Snyder.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.710
Why did I bring him here?

25:45.794 --> 25:49.047
If he figures out I'm poor,
he'll know I'm a gold digger!

25:49.130 --> 25:50.382
Why would I care more

25:50.465 --> 25:54.761
about his dumb, punchable head
than my own...

25:54.844 --> 25:58.515
I put his needs before mine.

25:58.598 --> 25:59.933
What?

26:00.016 --> 26:01.142
Why?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.186
He's so gross!

26:03.270 --> 26:05.021
Who cares if he's the only decent

26:05.105 --> 26:07.274
straight white man in the entire universe?

26:07.357 --> 26:10.944
I can barely bring myself
to look into his kind eyes

26:11.027 --> 26:13.947
that dare to see a better world.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.198
Oh, God.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.951
I didn't make him fall in love with me.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.537
I'm falling for him.

26:21.621 --> 26:24.833
You stupid bitch!

26:27.961 --> 26:28.878
Holy crap!

26:28.962 --> 26:30.046
Four minutes.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.382
The trick is not caring
if you live or die.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.763
And look, you just made it
through the day.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.725
Hmm, okay.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.311
Just one day, but it's a start.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.105
And just knowing that someone

26:47.188 --> 26:49.774
cared enough about me to do this...

26:52.235 --> 26:54.612
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

26:54.696 --> 26:57.782
whazzaaaaap?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.285
What the heck?

27:00.368 --> 27:01.703
No, you're not drunk.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.997
- You can't be!
- I am super drunk.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.417
Lady, I wasn't going to lunch
when you found me.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.544
I was on my way to the laser light show

27:09.627 --> 27:13.089
at the planetarium
wearing a CamelBak full of vodka.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.383
And I would have gotten away with it too.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.385
- You did get away with it!
- I did.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.595
Jersey strong!

27:18.678 --> 27:20.305
Go, Devils!

27:20.388 --> 27:21.306
Guess what.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.183
I like Day Andrea better than you.

27:23.266 --> 27:25.393
Guess what. I'm not two different people.

27:25.477 --> 27:30.065
I'm just one big mess,
and you can't fix me, Kimmy.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.148
Sorry.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.987
Fine, whatever.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.324
I don't care.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.575
But you do.

27:40.658 --> 27:41.826
You care so much.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.119
Why is that?

27:43.203 --> 27:46.039
Because I like helping other people.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.999
And I need your help.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.683
One more strike, and the Thompson family

27:49.709 --> 27:51.127
gets a chance to steal!

27:51.211 --> 27:52.796
I care because it's my fault, okay?

27:52.879 --> 27:54.679
I'm the reason your boundaries
got screwed up.

27:54.714 --> 27:55.924
It's my fault you're leaving.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.051
Oh, brother.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.805
Your world-famous abandonment issues.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.765
Oh, God.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.267
Am I really gonna have to say this
out loud to you?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.520
This is so hack.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.237
It's not your fault.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.280
It's not your fault.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.364
One Oprah style:

28:20.407 --> 28:23.660
it's not your fault!

28:23.743 --> 28:26.287
The way I am has nothing to do with you.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.748
You're not responsible
for other people's problems.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.083
You never have been.

28:30.166 --> 28:34.337
It's not your fault that people leave,
dummy.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.260
I guess this is how
my relationship with my mom

28:40.343 --> 28:42.053
stinks up my current relationships.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.556
Chanandler Bing!

28:44.639 --> 28:48.393
And until... Until... Until

28:48.476 --> 28:51.146
you deal with her for reals,

28:51.229 --> 28:54.441
you are just gonna continue
to do the same thing

28:54.524 --> 28:57.944
over and over and over again.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.947
It's called a pattern.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.490
And so is this.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.451
<i>♪ Watch me whip, whip ♪</i>

29:04.534 --> 29:06.077
<i>♪ And watch me nae nae ♪</i>

29:06.161 --> 29:07.954
<i>♪ And whip, whip ♪</i>

29:08.037 --> 29:09.330
<i>♪ And nae nae ♪</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:11.416
<i>♪ And stanky leg ♪</i>

29:11.499 --> 29:13.293
<i>♪ Stanky leg ♪</i>

29:13.376 --> 29:16.045
<i>♪ Break your legs ♪</i>

29:16.129 --> 29:17.589
<i>♪ Watch me whip, whip ♪</i>

29:17.672 --> 29:18.673
<i>♪ Watch me nae nae ♪</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:22.302
<i>♪ And whip, whip ♪</i>

29:22.385 --> 29:24.387
<i>♪ And watch me nae nae ♪</i>

29:30.685 --> 29:32.604
Hey, can I cook with this wine?

29:32.687 --> 29:33.688
It's already open.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.856
Sure, but that's not wine.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.419
That bottle's there 'cause of a leak.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.109
Why is it red?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.123
Future Andromitano residence.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.249
This is Mikus.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.209
You'll be Tikey.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.086
Titus, Judy Layman calling.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.964
That toilet was broken
when I went in there, Judy.

30:00.048 --> 30:00.965
No, no, no, no, listen.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.209
We want to offer you the part

30:02.258 --> 30:04.761
of Guy Who Stalks Tracy Chambers
in <i>Mahogany.</i>

30:04.844 --> 30:06.471
What?

30:06.554 --> 30:07.680
You're casting me?

30:07.764 --> 30:09.057
<i>Look, you were clearly very ill,</i>

30:09.140 --> 30:10.683
but you went out there anyway,

30:10.767 --> 30:12.685
and that is exactly what we look for

30:12.769 --> 30:13.913
in our cruise ship performers.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.105
<i>If you're a human being on a cruise ship,</i>

30:16.189 --> 30:19.150
you will be violently ill
with some combination

30:19.234 --> 30:21.986
of norovirus, Legionnaires' disease,

30:22.070 --> 30:24.864
improperly prepared seafood,
bird flu, pool feces,

30:24.948 --> 30:26.074
STDs from the crew,

30:26.157 --> 30:28.493
and that's assuming nobody murders you.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.656
Judy, make like the ends of a doggy's legs
and pause.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.121
This is for a cruise?

30:32.205 --> 30:33.623
<i>Yeah, I thought you knew that.</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:35.917
It's four months in the Caribbean.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.627
No.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.255
I mean, I can't just leave New York.
I-I...

30:41.256 --> 30:42.590
Judy, he'll call you back.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.260
Dude, you got to take that job.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.636
What are you talking about?

30:46.719 --> 30:48.447
You just told me
you wanted to move in together.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.890
I do, but we can figure that out
when you get back.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.059
In four months!

30:53.142 --> 30:55.061
That's, like, three Judd Apatow movies!

30:55.144 --> 30:56.304
I can't think that far ahead.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.107
I don't even know how this sentence
is gonna end volcano!

30:59.190 --> 31:00.859
You're going.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.193
It's Dionne Warwick.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.987
That's Whitney Houston's cousin!

31:04.070 --> 31:07.365
How can I leave when you're starting
to say gay stuff like that?

31:07.448 --> 31:08.658
Weren't you at that funeral?

31:08.741 --> 31:10.493
Did you hear nothing Ice-T said?

31:10.577 --> 31:12.996
You got to go for it, have no regrets.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.873
Norman wasn't a loser.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.165
He was beautiful,

31:16.249 --> 31:17.709
like that one-handed touchdown catch

31:17.792 --> 31:19.377
Odell Beckham Jr. made last year.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.754
Yeah, I'm still gonna say stuff like that.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.339
I have levels.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.720
You'd risk losing me

31:28.803 --> 31:29.888
for me?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.644
Guys, I'm gonna find my mom.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.770
I don't know how.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.439
I have no idea where she could be.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.733
But if I can find every goshdang Waldo

31:41.816 --> 31:43.401
that's ever crossed my path,

31:43.484 --> 31:45.111
then I can find Lori-Ann Schmidt.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.322
I'll probably have to hire a private eye,

31:47.405 --> 31:50.074
someone who can infiltrate
the coasterhead community

31:50.158 --> 31:51.159
by becoming one of them,

31:51.242 --> 31:53.161
all while running the risk that he forgets

31:53.244 --> 31:54.913
whose side he's really on.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.596
And I know I can count on the two of you

31:56.623 --> 31:57.823
and your unique set of skills.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.585
Um, actually,
I just found her on Facebook.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.213
Girl, that bitch is in Orlando.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.468
Oh.

32:08.551 --> 32:11.095
That was easy.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.265
Why'd it take them so long to find me?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.962
<i>- Good night, everybody!
- Good night!</i>

33:26.305 --> 33:32.919
