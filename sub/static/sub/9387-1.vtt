00:01.502 --> 00:04.838
It seems today that all you see

00:04.922 --> 00:08.133
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.217 --> 00:11.595
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.845 --> 00:14.598
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.101
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.393 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.688 --> 00:23.148
All the things that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.775
Laugh and cry

00:24.900 --> 00:29.655
He's a family guy

00:35.160 --> 00:37.204
We interrupt this program
with a special report.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.957
Quahog is seeing
its worst flu epidemic in years,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.167
due in part to a severe shortage
of flu shots.

00:42.251 --> 00:46.046
Let's go live to Asian flu correspondent,
Tricia Takanawa, Tricia?

00:46.129 --> 00:47.506
Diane, I'm...

00:47.589 --> 00:48.632
(VOMITING)

00:49.842 --> 00:53.095
Thank you, Tricia.
We now return you to Robin, Boy Wonder.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.139
-Help!
-Help us! Oh, my God!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.725
(PANTING) Hey, don't worry. I'm here.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.270
-Robin? They sent you?
-Yeah.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.856
Everyone else was busy, so they sent me.

01:04.022 --> 01:07.359
What the hell are you gonna do?
You don't have any superpowers.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.987
I got a cell phone.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.990
Oh, no bars.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.457
-All right, who's next for a flu shot?
-Oh, that's me. I'm Peter Griffin.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.835
Mr. Griffin,
these flu shots are in short supply.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.504
We need to save them for the elderly.
Like these folks here.

01:27.671 --> 01:28.672
Oh. Okay.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.049
Well, I guess
I'll be heading out then and...

01:31.133 --> 01:32.384
(EXCLAIMS)

01:32.509 --> 01:33.844
Oh, look at that.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.387
Oh, well, since it's already in there,

01:35.470 --> 01:38.056
you might as well push down
on the old plunger there.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.266
You're a monster.

01:39.349 --> 01:43.103
You know what was a monster?
Frampton Comes Alive, 1976.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.606
Is there anyone you knew
who didn't have that record?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.483
I don't think so.
All right, have a good winter.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.028
(SIGHS) Very well, Mr. Griffin,
you got your flu shot.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.821
Now, if you'll just sign here.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.531
-Well, this is odd.
-What?

01:54.698 --> 01:58.619
Well, you're 42 years old and it says here
you've never had a prostate exam.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.413
No, but I've had other exams.
Like that one in college.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.208
Damn it, this is too hard!

02:04.541 --> 02:07.711
Here's what I think of your test,
Mr. Teacher.

02:09.338 --> 02:13.634
You just stood up to me. Congratulations.
That was the test.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.302

02:16.720 --> 02:20.849
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear

02:21.016 --> 02:22.601
Yeah!

02:23.727 --> 02:25.270
Okay, heart sounds good.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.355
All right, Mr. Griffin,

02:26.438 --> 02:27.648
I'm just going to need you
to drop your pants,

02:27.731 --> 02:29.233
and we'll check your prostate.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.317
What?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.611
Drop your pants, turn around,
and lean forward.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.238
Okay.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.493
So, how's this work,
you just feel my pulse or...

-What the hell was that?
-Mr. Griffin, that's a prostate exam.

02:48.836 --> 02:53.090
-Shut up! You had your finger in my ass!
-That's how a prostate exam is performed.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
-Now, if you'll just let me...
-Get away from me!

03:18.824 --> 03:21.785
Peter, my God, you look terrible.
What happened?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.370
I was raped.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.831
(CHUCKLING)

03:25.914 --> 03:29.084
-What?
-Dr. Hartman violated me.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.961
He took my innocence.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.047
(LAUGHING) What?

03:34.131 --> 03:35.507
(WHISPERING)

03:36.133 --> 03:37.968
Peter, that's a prostate exam.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.888
It's an important part
of a physical for men your age.

You sound just like him!

How about some TV, huh?

-Are we still going to the baseball game?
-Get that away from me, Chris.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.340
Stop it, Meg.

04:21.011 --> 04:26.892
Peter, I'm trying to be supportive, but
after all, it was just a prostate exam.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.812
You weren't there, Lois.
You weren't there.

04:34.191 --> 04:38.529
Who's that? Who are you? Where's Peter?
Where is he?

04:38.612 --> 04:42.199
You're a whore.
Wear your whore makeup, you whore.

-CHRIS: Is somebody in there?
-Ocupado.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.286
Filthy whore.

You're somebody's father,
you filthy whore.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.459
Hi, sweetie.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.295
Look at her staring.
What are you looking at, huh?

04:55.379 --> 04:57.881
God, I should take her out
right here with these, man.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.759
Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring?
Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?

I'm afraid Rupert had a little injury.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.504
Oh, Rupert, please live.

05:37.588 --> 05:41.008
Please, I'll never be short
with you again. We'll go away.

05:41.091 --> 05:45.095
We'll go to Hawaii. Would you like that?
I always envisioned how it would be.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.555

Don't frolic too much, Rupert.
Save some energy for the hula contest.

Stewie, I have a surprise for you.
Good as new.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.831
Rupert! It's really him.
I don't believe it.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.459
You... You did this for me?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.504
And to help you feel better,
I made your favorite dinner.

Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.061

Peter, what's the matter with you today?
You're not yourself.

It's not okay.
You don't know what it's like.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.970
You're wrong.

07:08.053 --> 07:12.975
I, too, have felt the cold finger
of injustice on my insidey parts.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.727
He... He did it to you, too?

07:15.811 --> 07:20.190
I have something to say.
Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.193
I only went in there
for a physical/guinea pig removal,

07:23.277 --> 07:27.906
but I turned out to be the guinea pig
for his sexual experimentation.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.908
You guys are a bunch of queers.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.288

Oh, God, it was horrible!

I scrubbed, and I scrubbed, but damn it,
they don't make water hot enough!

My God, we've all been victims
of Dr. Hartman's "prostate exam."

Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here.
I will not turn a brown eye to this.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.929
I am going to sue that bastard
and make him pay out the ass.

You can't do that,
all he did was give you a prostate exam.

Are you saying I asked for this to happen?

08:36.141 --> 08:37.768
