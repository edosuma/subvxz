I'm just imagining you
parachuting into the Mekong Delta,

01:47.840 --> 01:50.434
telling the black pajamas
to leave your husband alone.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.269
Shoulda.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.954
Coulda saved a lotta lives if wives
and mothers from both sides came

01:55.040 --> 01:57.111
and dragged their fool
men home by the ear.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.631
Anything I can do
to help this mess?

02:00.720 --> 02:03.838
Yeah, you can take
Noreen home with you.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.794
Her place burned
down with the shop

making muscles.

do now, you know?

the belt, kid.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.994
Now that the shop's gone...

14:11.120 --> 14:13.191
Peggy,

14:13.280 --> 14:17.319
before you, uh, before you start
making plans, you should know

14:17.400 --> 14:19.550
I got a forensic
team coming down

14:19.640 --> 14:21.711
from the Twin Cities
in the morning.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.110
And I know
it's been repaired,

14:24.200 --> 14:27.192
but we're gonna check
your car for blood.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.351
Microscopically, I mean.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.717
Which you'd be amazed
at what we can find

14:32.800 --> 14:34.393
on the atomic
level these days.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.872
No. I mean, you can't
do that, of course,

14:38.960 --> 14:41.076
without permission
from the owner.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.312
You know? So... Oh, we got
permission about an hour ago.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.869
You sold the car to
Sonny Greer, didn't you?

14:46.960 --> 14:49.190
Earlier? At the body shop?

14:49.280 --> 14:52.238
And Sonny now is
the owner on record.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.913
And he was more
than happy to... No.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.150
No, you can't. That's...

14:56.240 --> 14:58.516
Hold on...
Peggy. Peggy.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.193
I'm serious now.

15:02.040 --> 15:06.034
Better you tell me before
I get a fistful of evidence.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.353
What happened that night when
you hit Rye Gerhardt with your car?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.075
ED: I'm the victim here.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.953
Ed.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.599
I mean, 'cause...

15:20.680 --> 15:24.230
I sat in your living room last
night and gave you the chance,

15:24.360 --> 15:26.510
you and Peggy both,
I gave you the chance to...

15:26.600 --> 15:30.036
I know, but you
gotta understand.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.316
We're just trying to...
No, me.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.516
I'm just trying to
protect my family.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.910
There was a cleaver
in the man's head, son,

15:37.040 --> 15:38.758
which Noreen said was you.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.353
Not to mention
there's a war going on

15:43.440 --> 15:44.874
up in Fargo that
you may have started

15:44.960 --> 15:46.997
when you ran over that
Gerhardt boy in Peggy's car!

15:47.080 --> 15:49.833
You or (STUTTERS)
Peggy, or both!

15:50.720 --> 15:53.519
This is all just so crazy.

15:53.680 --> 15:54.670
(SCOFFS)

15:55.960 --> 16:00.113
And I can't stop thinking
about that book, Noreen's book.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.271
It's, like, stuck in
my head. What?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.680
What book?

16:03.760 --> 16:06.593
It's about this
guy who, every day,

16:06.680 --> 16:10.196
he pushes this
rock up this hill.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.879
Like a boulder.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.672
And then every night,
it just rolls back down.

16:17.240 --> 16:21.552
But he doesn't stop, you know?
He just... He keeps going.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.078
And he wakes up every day
and he starts pushing.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.473
By which, (STUTTERS)
I guess I'm saying,

16:31.560 --> 16:33.153
it doesn't matter
what they throw at me,

16:33.240 --> 16:35.629
I'm gonna take care
of what's mine. And...

16:39.880 --> 16:42.713
These boys aren't gonna rest
until you're dead, son.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.593
Possibly Peggy, too.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.239
I want a lawyer.

16:49.840 --> 16:50.830
(SIGHS)

16:50.920 --> 16:55.232
Lou, (STUTTERS) I need
one. I'm asking you for one.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.590
Ed, that's not... No, I've
seen the shows on TV.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.750
No, you don't...

16:58.840 --> 17:01.559
I've seen the shows on TV.
Ironside and...

17:04.440 --> 17:07.353
This is all too important
to make mistakes here.

17:07.440 --> 17:12.037
So, get me a lawyer,
a good one,

17:12.119 --> 17:16.114
and if he says,
then I'll talk.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.276
No, Sonny, they just
called themselves plumbers,

17:22.359 --> 17:26.115
but what it was was a
special investigative unit

17:26.200 --> 17:27.598
inside the White House...

17:27.680 --> 17:28.829
BLUTH: Hey, Karl.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.275
Percy.
Got a customer for you.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.591
A client, I guess you...
Over at the station.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.796
Ed Blumquist?
Butcher's assistant?

17:38.880 --> 17:42.077
I guess he's mixed up
in all the craziness.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.390
You hear that, Sonny?

17:44.480 --> 17:48.792
There's a crisis at the highest
level, so who do they call?

17:48.920 --> 17:50.479
The best lawyer in town.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.597
Aren't you the only
lawyer in town, Karl?

17:52.680 --> 17:56.639
Yes, but that's because I
scared away all my... (CLANKING)

17:56.760 --> 17:58.478
Great Caesar's ghost.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.594
It would appear I'm
a little unstable...

18:00.680 --> 18:01.909
BLUTH: You okay there, Karl?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.673
Want me to tell Lou
you need a few hours?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.320
Fermez ton bouche, son.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.596
I am sound in mind and body,

18:08.680 --> 18:11.911
and ready to run circles
around the inferior minds

18:12.000 --> 18:14.116
of the Rock County
Sheriff's Department.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.032
Lou is a state cop, Karl.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.394
KARL: Shut up, Sonny.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.556
I will need you
to drive, however.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.151
My question for you is,

18:51.400 --> 18:52.913
how come after
you hit that fella

18:53.000 --> 18:55.992
you didn't just
drive to the hospital?

18:56.720 --> 18:59.951
Or wave down
a passing motorist

19:00.040 --> 19:02.031
and ask him
to call the cops?

19:12.120 --> 19:14.714
You say it like these
things happen in a vacuum.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.470
Like it's a test.
Check A or B.

19:21.080 --> 19:26.075
But it's like decisions you
make in a dream, you know?

19:30.240 --> 19:34.234
I'll tell you what, if it was
me and we had to run,

19:35.840 --> 19:36.989
I wouldn't look back.

19:38.200 --> 19:42.478
For what? The dazzle?
(SCOFFS) This house?

19:42.560 --> 19:44.437
This is Ed's house.

19:44.520 --> 19:49.435
He grew up here,
his mom washing his undies.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.352
His father taking his paper
to the commode.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.715
You ask me how come
I buy all these magazines?

20:02.840 --> 20:05.036
I'm living in
a museum of the past.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.633
(CAR APPROACHING)

20:16.120 --> 20:17.190
Okay.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.430
(CAR STOPS)

20:18.520 --> 20:19.794
You stay here.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.190
Sheriff?
Go inside now, Peggy.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.795
If you got a hiding place in the
basement or the attic, go to that.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.757
What about you?
Go, now.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.916
And don't come out,
no matter what you hear.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.755
Hi.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.989
HANK: Hello.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.316
Help you fellas
with something?

21:13.400 --> 21:14.549
Hope so.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.359
Ed home?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.589
Ed who?

21:25.000 --> 21:25.990
Oh.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.958
(CHUCKLES) Ed. Yeah.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.875
Yeah.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.433
Yeah, you
just missed him.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.916
A whole squad took him to
the station about an hour ago.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.514
And that's
the well-guarded

21:39.600 --> 21:42.877
and impenetrable police
station on Hazel Lane

21:44.120 --> 21:46.953
which, don't let the name
fool you, is a fortress.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.032
Or maybe he's inside
and you think I'm stupid.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.350
Son,

21:54.520 --> 21:58.275
I could fill a steamer trunk with
the amount of stupid I think you are.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.112
But, no, that's
where he went.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.310
(WHISTLING)

22:23.120 --> 22:26.158
Yeah, that's what I thought.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.153
Here we go.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.433
No, Peggy, hey, hey...

22:49.600 --> 22:51.989
Said the butcher's
down at the precinct.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.833
Could be bullshit,
take Polk and Carter.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.399
I'll clean up here.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.798
MAN: All clear upstairs!

23:33.560 --> 23:34.959
(GRUNTING)

24:23.720 --> 24:25.393
MAN: Here, Kitty, Kitty.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.037
Come on, Kitty.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.235
Kitty.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.913
Here, Kitty, kitty.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.993

(GROANS)

24:39.120 --> 24:40.474
(MAN GROANS IN PAIN)

24:42.080 --> 24:43.229
Shut up.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.558
Shut up, you fool.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.750
(CLANKING)

(GRUNTS)

24:53.200 --> 24:54.349
Shit.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.190
When I find you, darling,
I'm gonna make you bleed.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.155
Bitch!

26:03.920 --> 26:04.910
(GRUNTS)

26:15.000 --> 26:15.990
(SLURPING)

26:17.600 --> 26:18.749
Hon.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.078
Yeah?
Don't leave.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.360
Wanna talk to you
about something.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.229
Are you with us?

26:31.520 --> 26:32.590
When you say "us..."

26:32.680 --> 26:35.194
I mean the family.
All of it.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.079
You don't get to
pick and choose.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.353
Sure, Grandma.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.039
We all got
a role to play.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.558
You need to
take my example.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.515
Be a leader.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.114
This is our time.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.239
No such thing as men's
work, women's work anymore.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.152
We got just as
much right to...

27:25.240 --> 27:26.230
(DOG BARKING)

27:29.720 --> 27:30.710
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

27:57.640 --> 27:59.278
Keep it running, Sonny.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.000
I'll be back before
the beer goes warm.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.711
Greetings
and salutations.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.359
I have made the pilgrimage
from the Hall of Veterans,

28:13.440 --> 28:16.592
as George Washington
once forded the Delaware,

28:16.680 --> 28:19.479
steely in my resolve,
prepared to battle

28:19.560 --> 28:21.517
unto my dying breath
for the rights...

28:21.600 --> 28:23.511
Lawyer's here.
Hey, Denise.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.193
For the rights
of free men!

28:25.280 --> 28:26.953
Hey, Karl,
Ed's in back.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.111
Rights that were squeezed
from British oppression

28:29.200 --> 28:31.191
like water
from a stone!

28:31.280 --> 28:32.953
That all men
are created equal,

28:33.040 --> 28:36.635
free from the jackboot tyranny
and gulag magic tricks

28:36.720 --> 28:38.313
of nameless,
faceless committees.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.396
Hey, hope they
didn't wake you.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.039
Out of my way,
tool of the state.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.397
For I have come to comfort
and counsel my client

28:44.480 --> 28:46.153
even as you seek
to prison him!

28:46.240 --> 28:47.639
Yeah, whatever you're
gonna do, you got 30 minutes.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.870
Don't dictate terms
to me, you rogue.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.873
For the law is
a light on a hill,

28:53.000 --> 28:57.312
calling to its breast all
those in search of justice.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.119
To wit, this poor, mottled
wretch in front of me.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.349
Hey, Karl.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.309
Edward.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.640
What a sad
and fortuitous day.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.314
You chained to
that table and me...

29:10.400 --> 29:11.754
No, I'm not in cuffs.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.558
Chained in thought
if not action.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.676
At the mercy of
a cold and venal...

29:16.760 --> 29:17.909
(STUTTERS)
I didn't do this thing...

29:18.000 --> 29:20.992
No, no, don't tell me.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.754
The establishment has
ears everywhere, even here.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.910
Ears?

29:25.000 --> 29:28.709
Instead I shall
simply ask, "G or NG,"

29:28.800 --> 29:31.713
and you, my client,

29:31.800 --> 29:34.952
will shake your head
in the affirmative

29:35.040 --> 29:39.671
for the letter or letters that
best describes your status.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.513
So, I shake my head "yes"?

29:42.600 --> 29:46.673
Let's say, for the purposes of the
cameras that are no doubt watching,

29:48.360 --> 29:51.239
that a negative shake,
side to side,

29:51.320 --> 29:54.517
shall in this case be
a positive affirmation.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.150
Remember, only shake once.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.710
G?

30:04.480 --> 30:07.871
Or NG?

30:10.760 --> 30:12.910
Well, son, rest assured,

30:14.480 --> 30:19.554
whatever your status, I shall
defend you till your last breath.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.153
I mean, my last breath.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.040
Excuse the obvious
death penalty snafu.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.599
I'm slightly inebriated.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.993
LOU: Still got 26 minutes.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.230
And that, by no
strange coincidence,

30:35.320 --> 30:36.913
is the amount of
time it'll take me

30:37.000 --> 30:38.513
to rouse Judge
Peabody from his bed

30:38.600 --> 30:41.069
and have him dismiss
these unfounded charges.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.275
No charges as of yet.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.676
Held without charges!
Even better.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.832
Then I shall have to tell His
Honor to boost my client from these

30:47.960 --> 30:50.713
baseless restraints you've
shackled him under! Whoa!

30:50.800 --> 30:51.995
Hey, you're not driving,
are you?

30:52.120 --> 30:54.509
My choices outside this
building are none of your...

30:54.600 --> 30:57.956
But, no, Sonny
valeted me here tonight.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.189
But now,

30:59.280 --> 31:01.351
now I must
bid you all adieu

31:01.440 --> 31:04.193
and admonish you to
watch your proverbial butts,

31:04.280 --> 31:06.954
for I shall be back with the
sledgehammer of justice,

31:07.040 --> 31:10.476
prepared to lay Joseph waste
to these four walls,

31:10.560 --> 31:13.632
if you so much as
touch a hair on my client's...

31:13.800 --> 31:15.074
(GUNS COCKING)

31:33.040 --> 31:34.030
(STRAINING)

31:37.320 --> 31:38.515
Karl?

31:39.480 --> 31:41.278
The jackboots are upon us.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.270
Deputy Bluth, I need
you to lock the back door.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.634
Do it now.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.950
Garfield, kill the
lights in back.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.792
Denise, get on
the horn to HQ.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.394
Tell 'em we need every man
available yesterday.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.318
There's a lynching
party outside.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.069
DENISE: Shouldn't call
the sheriff first?

32:05.160 --> 32:08.039
Well, you can try, but somehow
I don't think he'll answer.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.758
If he does, tell him not
to do anything heroic

32:09.840 --> 32:11.433
until reinforcements arrive.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.520
You okay there, counselor?

32:14.680 --> 32:16.910
It's possible
I soiled myself.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.799
Here for my boy.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.799
Doesn't have to get any
more complicated than that.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.793
Met you before.
At the compound.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.279
BEAR: So you know.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.636
Already called for
backup on the radio.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.354
Nobody's coming.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.078
No, they'll come.

32:42.160 --> 32:46.119
State police up in Marshall or
sheriff out of Nobles, 30, 40 minutes.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.191
Maybe we got a trap set.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.549
That's possible.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.998
Just gonna keep
coming, though.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.397
After Wounded Knee?

32:54.480 --> 32:56.756
Hell, the governor may
send in the National Guard.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.759
Now, we got your son
on attempted murder.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.231
Took a shot at the local
butcher. The place burned down.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.593
Where's that butcher now?

33:11.920 --> 33:13.194
LOU: No.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.396
I know you got
designs on him.

33:15.480 --> 33:16.993
He inside?

33:17.800 --> 33:20.440
He's safe,
guarded by armed men.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.278
No.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.634
No, he's not.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.999
This kinda thing
didn't work in Westerns

33:26.080 --> 33:27.514
and it's not
gonna work tonight.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.319
We got enough men and guns
to hold you off till morning.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.960
Maybe I got a trunk
full of dynamite,

33:35.280 --> 33:36.759
blow my way in.

33:37.920 --> 33:43.279
Either way, you got less than
five minutes to send my Charlie out.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.350
Who's this Charlie now?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.158
Karl, I'm serious, I
need you to sit over there

34:05.240 --> 34:06.639
and stay out of the way.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.074
Deputy, how we doing
securing the back of the building?

34:09.159 --> 34:11.389
Well, I mean,
I locked the door.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.312
Well, let's barricade
that, yeah?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.311
Shades down on
all the windows.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.879
We got any light bulbs?

34:16.960 --> 34:18.155
Light bulbs?

34:18.239 --> 34:19.878
I want you to take
all the light bulbs we got,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.315
smash 'em up by the
back doors and windows.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.197
That way we can hear 'em
if they try to sneak in.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.918
Oh. That's good thinking.

34:33.159 --> 34:34.992
Need your help here.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.071
I thought you
had backup coming.

34:37.159 --> 34:39.674
Closest men are outside
Nobles, an hour away.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.759
Plus, you're talking
about farm boys

34:43.840 --> 34:46.514
who've never been face-to-face
with a serious man before.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.114
Whereas I stared
down Chiang Kai-shek.

34:50.800 --> 34:55.351
That, and I need someone who
can talk some sense into the father.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.878
Who better than
his son's lawyer?

35:01.600 --> 35:02.999
Don't represent
the son, though.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.440
You do now, Karl.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.590
Lou?

35:19.840 --> 35:22.116
I'm walking you
out of here.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.634
Am I released then?

35:23.720 --> 35:25.631
Well, let's call it
that for simplicity.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.155
Truth is, there's a
lynch mob outside

35:28.240 --> 35:29.719
wanting to string you up.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.915
What are you...

35:31.000 --> 35:32.035
Come on.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.952
Stay close and
be ready to run.

35:50.320 --> 35:51.833
DENISE: (OVER RADIO)
Sheriff, come in.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.109
Sheriff?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.270
Come in. Sheriff?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.509
Sheriff?

36:01.840 --> 36:05.071
Sheriff, there's a calamity up
here. If you're there, pick up.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.671
Yeah, Denise. I'm here.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.149
Oh, Sheriff, thank God!
There's an army of men outside.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.800
They want Ed Blumquist
and that kid from the fire.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.393
Lou's got this plan to...

36:18.880 --> 36:21.998
(SIGHS) Told me to tell you not
to come till reinforcements arrive,

36:22.080 --> 36:24.276
which, sheriff's
deputies are on their way

36:24.400 --> 36:26.516
from Nobles,
so maybe 45 minutes, sir.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.873
Yeah, okay. Uh...

36:30.600 --> 36:32.876
Tell Lou to sit tight.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.037
Can't have him getting
killed without me.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.313
Never hear the end
of it at dinner.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.751
MAN: Maybe they
forgot we're here.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.555
Yeah.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.749
Gear up. We're going in.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.234
Hold on now. We're allies.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.119
Like Ho Chi Minh
and the Red Chinese.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.554
Arms in the air.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.839
Karl Weathers.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.193
That's my name.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.433
I'm your son's attorney.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.954
Don't need a lawyer.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.679
He's going home tonight.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.472
Send him out.
I'm done playing.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.198
Yes, sir.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.112
That's in the works as we...

38:11.600 --> 38:12.670
You mind if I...

38:20.840 --> 38:22.478
As your son's man,

38:24.360 --> 38:27.512
I spoke with the constabulary
at the highest level,

38:31.560 --> 38:34.074
and they're prepared to
meet your demands.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.073
Send the boy out.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.552
Processing him now.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.835
But as his lawyer...

38:42.920 --> 38:45.389
Don't need no lawyer,
I told you.

38:45.480 --> 38:49.678
As his lawyer, I gotta advise
you of something, which is this.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.512
You're making it worse.

38:53.800 --> 38:57.509
He's a minor, see? Only 17.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.796
So, reduced
sentencing applies.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.350
Shh.

39:03.440 --> 39:05.670
KARL: And, yes, witness
puts a gun in his hand

39:05.760 --> 39:07.910
with a shot fired,
but it's a miss.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.959
You understand?

39:11.920 --> 39:15.629
A miss, so even if they convict
him, it's attempted at best.

39:15.720 --> 39:19.759
The maximum is 10 years,
he's out in five for good behavior.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.035
Done.

39:21.640 --> 39:22.789
But this,

39:25.120 --> 39:29.318
you take him outta here now
and he's running the rest of his life.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.755
A wanted fugitive,
shoot on sight.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.633
But there's a way out.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.037
Leave now,

39:45.120 --> 39:47.396
take your men, and none
of this falls on the kid.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.471
This is the deal I made.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.039
He stays clean.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.479
But you gotta go. Now.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.590
Maybe we leave Charlie,
just take the butcher.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.156
Well, now, that's a problem.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.600
See, any movement there
and they loop the kid in,

40:15.680 --> 40:16.954
make him an accomplice.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.680
Kidnapping, conspiracy
to commit murder,

40:19.760 --> 40:22.320
assaulting a police officer,
or worse.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.592
So, we're back to
the best thing for the kid

40:27.680 --> 40:30.832
being a fast
retreat on your part.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.749
That's the clearest path
of victory for you.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.600
Think about it.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.997
He's only 17.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.035
Let's go.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.277
ED: I need to find Peggy.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.870
LOU: (SIGHS) Can't do
that, Ed. Not right now.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.473
You're still in my custody.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.029
ED: Yeah, but what if
they came to the house?

42:01.440 --> 42:03.272
I mean, they went
to the station,

42:03.360 --> 42:05.510
what if they came to the... Shh.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.590
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

42:27.640 --> 42:28.710
Come on.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.389
Christ, man.
You look worse than me.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.153
Smell better maybe.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.112
No, don't tire yourself.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.553
We know
where he's headed.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.153
Maybe you drive.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.599
I'm seeing double.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.710
(EXHALES)

43:16.960 --> 43:18.394
(SIRENS WAILING)

43:50.200 --> 43:55.400
(SINGING) I am a man
of constant sorrow

43:55.920 --> 43:59.709
I've seen trouble
all my days

43:59.920 --> 44:02.594
I'm talking about
the camaraderie of men, kid.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.195
That hard-to-define male bond,
born in the age of the Neanderthal

44:07.280 --> 44:10.113
when men still hunted
mastodon with flint and spears.

44:11.840 --> 44:16.232
The place where he
was born and raised

44:17.040 --> 44:21.876
For six long years, oh,
I've been in trouble

44:23.560 --> 44:28.236
I'm saying you find that in
wartime, that foxhole brotherhood.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.118
Then when you come back,

44:31.200 --> 44:34.272
well, there's no civilian
equivalent, not in peacetime.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.955
...to help me now

44:38.560 --> 44:42.918
He has no friends
to help him now

44:43.520 --> 44:48.390
So it's fare thee well to you,
my old true lover

44:48.920 --> 44:51.230
I never expect
to see you again

44:51.320 --> 44:54.073
You sure know
a lot of words, Karl.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.798
I'm an esquire, Kid.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.354
A barrister.

45:00.040 --> 45:03.112
Defender of the common man,
the misaccused.

45:05.960 --> 45:10.158
Perhaps he'll die
upon this train
