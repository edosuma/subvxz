Would you like

03:38.640 --> 03:40.631
A double, please.
- Two singles.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.996
Actually, do you have
a separate room?

I'm afraid not. Everyone has to share here,
it's part of the communal...

03:47.840 --> 03:50.514

newspapers in the morning?

No, we try to keep the outside world

Yes, I do.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.513
What happened yesterday?

04:14.920 --> 04:17.798
Sting wore white jeans,
and a puppy got stuck in a fan.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.798
Big day.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.510
What's that for?
- My neck and chest.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.914
What's that for?
- My legs and knees.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.835
What's that for?
- Ends of my hair.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.713
What's that?
- For my under-eyes.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.513
What's that?
- That is for my face and body.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.356
What would you do
if someone stole all of those?

04:41.400 --> 04:42.993
I'd kill myself.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.350
Why are there no plug sockets in here?

04:45.400 --> 04:47.516
Don't touch my stuff.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.396
What are these for?
- Nothing.

Mm-hmm...

04:52.080 --> 04:53.080
What?

04:53.120 --> 04:54.793
Well, it's just...

04:54.840 --> 04:56.797
Why would you bring such tiny batteries?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.433
I'm just prepared.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.592
Just I've only ever...

05:01.640 --> 05:03.836
seen them used for remote controls...
- Yes, well...

05:03.880 --> 05:05.120
or alarm clocks.
- Yes, alright.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.753
And vibrators.
- Yes! Alright!

05:07.320 --> 05:09.630
You didn't have to ask for a separate room.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.795
What?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.880
If you wanna have a wank,
I can give you some space.

05:12.904 --> 05:14.234
Oh my God!

05:14.280 --> 05:15.736
No, it's just if you wanna take ten minutes

05:15.760 --> 05:18.360
I'll just go into the bathroom
and moisturise my wrists for a bit.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.389
You are so immature.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.794
Oh, give it a minute.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.592
Oh, God!

05:22.640 --> 05:25.598
Seriously?
What is wrong with your insides?

05:25.640 --> 05:28.109
Why did you bring the tiny batteries?

06:12.640 --> 06:13.835
Shame.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.633
Yes, the first major consideration
is why are you here?

06:20.360 --> 06:22.954
Can anyone here answer that question?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.311
I want to shut the noise out
and reconnect to my inner thoughts

06:26.360 --> 06:28.749
on the road to feeling
more at one with myself.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.711
Excellent attitude.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.790
Well, you're in the right place.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.720
This weekend is about being mindful.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.718
It's about leaving
your voice in your head

06:41.200 --> 06:43.953
and trapping your thoughts
in your skull.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.675
Think of it as <i>a...</i>
thought prison in your mind.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.711
Firstly, we're going
to teach you how to breathe.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.720
Then we will have a short meditation.

06:54.760 --> 06:59.072
Then we will find our sanctuary
in the partaking of menial tasks

06:59.120 --> 07:02.238
all in perfect silence.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.840

07:05.880 --> 07:09.510
If you need to communicate
with any of our other superiors

07:09.560 --> 07:11.756
you can write on that board.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.789
Under no other circumstances
must you communicate

07:14.840 --> 07:16.274
even with each other.

07:16.840 --> 07:21.471
Oh, what if there's an emergency?
- Thank you all for coming here today.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.677
your upbringing,
your experiences with women

08:58.720 --> 09:02.111
now is the time to turn that around

09:02.160 --> 09:06.950
to reprogramme your mind,
your body and your mouth

- Excellent.

- OK.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.919
OK.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.237
What should we say to her?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.749

09:57.560 --> 10:01.235

10:15.040 --> 10:17.998
Oh my God.
Excuse me, miss, you can't be here.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.110
OK.

10:19.160 --> 10:23.279
You really can't be here.
It's for your own good... please.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.674
And now hands up.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.629
Mirror your palms.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.673
Look each other in the eye and...

10:39.600 --> 10:40.635
touch.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.878
Literally her worst nightmare.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.278
Ergh.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.956
Are you alright?

10:59.400 --> 11:00.754
Talk to me.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.154
It's nothing.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.749
God... I can't feel my feet.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.755
Do you remember
we used to go top-to-toe?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.598
Ah, kids are so weird.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.039
We used to do that all the time.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.118
Yeah, when we were ten and cute,
now we're 30 and angry.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.594
God, I'm not suggesting that we...

11:19.640 --> 11:21.153
Just don't, OK?

11:54.720 --> 11:57.599
It's actually a really thoughtful
present. Thank you.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.034
And Martin, getting me that sculpture...

12:02.640 --> 12:05.439
He must have bent over backwards
to get something like that.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.797
I feel very lucky.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.478
I have to tell you something.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.034
What?

12:20.360 --> 12:24.991
I stole that sculpture
from a certain somebody's studio

12:25.040 --> 12:26.872
and then I tried to sell it through Martin

12:26.920 --> 12:29.036
but Martin took it and gave it to you.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.198
Just don't put it pride of place
when Dad...

12:32.240 --> 12:35.232
Well, when they come over.
OK? Because...

12:35.440 --> 12:36.999

13:17.360 --> 13:20.432

That's a really nice outfit.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.955

13:27.520 --> 13:31.115
Delve into your past.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.994
Think of something
you can't let go of...

13:35.440 --> 13:38.319
a moment of noise.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.997
A moment of tension.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.639
Not for now.

13:48.680 --> 13:53.277
Now... a moment
when you were peaceful.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.399
FLEABAG: If you could change anything
in the whole world, what would it be?

13:58.440 --> 14:00.238
My thighs.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.831
FLEABAG:
The whole world?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.951
Oh, don't tell anyone I said that.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.035
You?

14:06.920 --> 14:09.150
I've always been insecure
about my face...

14:09.200 --> 14:10.315
you know that.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.953
I know. You shouldn't.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.877
Nah, thank you but... hmm.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.434
No, seriously, there's
nothing wrong with your nose.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.440
I mean, there's nothing wrong...

14:19.480 --> 14:21.160
Say that again.
- I mean there's nothing...

14:21.184 --> 14:22.791
What?
- I don't know...

14:22.840 --> 14:24.114
_ Argh!
Oh my God!

14:24.160 --> 14:26.037
I always say the wrong thing!

14:26.080 --> 14:27.115
SHE LAUGHS

14:33.560 --> 14:35.471
FLEABAG GASPS

14:35.880 --> 14:37.234
(WHISPERS):
Hot.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.200
(WHISPERING THROUGHOUT):
What is this?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.277
I don't even do this in my own home.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.799
Oh, it's very simple.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.878
We've paid them to let us
clean their house in silence.

14:54.920 --> 14:59.118
SHE LAUGHS LOUDLY

15:01.720 --> 15:03.040
Jesus!

15:05.360 --> 15:08.239
RETREAT LEADER: I don't want to come
down on you like a school teacher

15:08.280 --> 15:13.195
but I'm afraid your flagrant lack of
respect for the one rule that we have here

15:13.240 --> 15:16.471
is now affecting the
other students... Er, clients.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.954
Inmates?
- Cleaners?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.229
Participants!

15:20.080 --> 15:22.754
Do you have a problem
with the programme?

15:24.160 --> 15:29.394
I suggest you try sitting here
in silence for the next hour.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.310
It will benefit you.
I swear by my soul it will.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.038
I went through your bag.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.029
What?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.435
I couldn't find anything
so you're just gonna

16:02.447 --> 16:03.696
have to tell me what's
going on with you.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.551
CLAIRE SIGHS

16:04.600 --> 16:07.353
Talk... or I will scream.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.671
I got the Finland promotion.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.154
What Finland promotion?

16:14.200 --> 16:17.016
How can you ask that? I've told you...
- Oh my God, I'm totally... I know, I know!

16:17.040 --> 16:19.156
The Finland promotion, that's amazing.
- Thank you.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
Would that mean
you're a millionaire now?

16:20.840 --> 16:21.671
Handy.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.631
Don't be ridiculous.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.275
Yes, it would.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.273
Well, money makes you cry?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.752
I'm turning it down.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.633
What? Why?

16:33.680 --> 16:35.159
Martin.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.998
Martin says it would be unfair on Jake.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.110
Jake's her stepson, he's really weird -

16:41.160 --> 16:43.629
probably clinically,
but no one really talks about that.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.149
He freaks out if she's gone
for longer than a day.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.158
And he's got this thing about
trying to get in the bath with her.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.872
No, no... No, Jake... No!

16:56.920 --> 16:58.638
He's fifteen.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.278
He's not your son.
- That's not the point.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.596
Go!
- I knew you'd say that.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.278
This is what you've always wanted.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.319
I know.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.032
No more power-suits,
fuck load of snow...

17:09.079 --> 17:09.876
I know.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.150
Perfect place for your cold, cold heart.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.192
I know! I can't, I have responsibilities.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.071
Oh, come on...

17:17.119 --> 17:19.839
Don't let other people get in the way
of what you really want.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.633
Finland is what you really want.

17:22.680 --> 17:27.595
My husband isn't other people, OK?
My husband is my life.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.349
Your husband tried to kiss me
on your birthday.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.269
Did he?

17:39.640 --> 17:41.233
SHE SIGHS

17:41.280 --> 17:42.873
Did he?

17:54.520 --> 17:55.669
DOOR CLOSES

18:03.600 --> 18:04.670
SHE SIGHS

18:12.600 --> 18:14.671
MAN:
Sluts!

18:14.720 --> 18:15.835
APPLAUSE

18:18.840 --> 18:20.831
MAN:
Sluts!

18:26.480 --> 18:28.153
MAN:
Sluts!

18:34.040 --> 18:35.189
MAN:
Sluts!

18:40.240 --> 18:42.356
MAN:
Slut!

18:43.080 --> 18:44.434
APPLAUSE

18:49.560 --> 18:50.709
LEADER:
Lovely, lovely.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.355
LEADER:
OK.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.830
LEADER: Up on your feet.
We're gonna say 'sorry Patricia'.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.913
ALL:
Sorry Patricia.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.880
LEADER: Lovely, give yourselves
a round of applause.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.919
Alright guys, well done. We're gonna
head back to that house...

19:08.360 --> 19:13.116
better men, yeah?
Well done. Good work. Great stuff.

19:26.960 --> 19:32.911
Go on... you can do it... you're ready.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
Yeah.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.589
I thought I recognised you.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
Fair enough.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.674
Probably for the best.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.672
So is your business...

19:57.400 --> 19:58.515
surviving?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
I'm sorry.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.319
Oh, I don't want that.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.554
So you're doing the whole
silent escape thing?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
Indeed.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
Going well?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.437
I touched a colleague's breast

20:31.800 --> 20:32.870
more than once

20:34.080 --> 20:35.150
at a party, I...

20:38.520 --> 20:40.318
They asked me to go on a workshop to...

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
huh.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.549
I'm just a very...

20:47.560 --> 20:49.073
disappointing man.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.073
No thanks, I'm trying to quit.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.399
Those, on the other hand...

21:09.560 --> 21:13.076
They keep asking me:
"What do you want from this workshop?

21:13.120 --> 21:14.315
What do you want?"

21:15.920 --> 21:17.877
I'm not telling them what I want.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.234
I wanna move back home.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.713
I want to hug my wife.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.189
Protect my children,
protect my daughter.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.676
I wanna move on.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.036
I want to apologise, to...

21:43.920 --> 21:45.035
everyone.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.713
I wanna go to the theater.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.960
I want to take clean cups
out of the dishwasher

21:58.520 --> 22:01.194
and put them in the cupboards... at home.

22:02.720 --> 22:07.032
And the next morning I want to
watch my wife drink from them.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.509
And I want to make her feel good.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.031
I want to make her orgasm again...

22:19.640 --> 22:20.755
and again.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.040
Truly.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.794
I just wanna cry, all the time.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
Claire?

24:39.640 --> 24:41.153
Have you seen my sister?

25:25.800 --> 25:27.359
BOO:
Hi, this is Boo.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.791
I can't come to the phone right now
but please leave me a messiagio

25:30.840 --> 25:32.114
and I'll get back to you.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.309
3:1“

25:38.360 --> 25:39.920
Someone should
probably disconnect that.
