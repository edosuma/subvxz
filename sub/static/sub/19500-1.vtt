<B> Lascivia </ b>

00:36.258 --> 00:39.047
<B> As you arrive, you leave, </ b>

00:39.182 --> 00:42.929
<B> No time to nest </ b>

00:43.064 --> 00:45.599
<B> we must continue. </ B>

00:46.300 --> 00:49.382
<B> I feel that </ b>

00:49.383 --> 00:52.330
<B> who knows when, </ b>

00:52.831 --> 00:56.361
<B> come and see me </ b>

00:56.362 --> 01:00.428
<B> again. </ B>

01:02.988 --> 01:04.988
A special welcome to
all of you tonight,

01:07.890 --> 01:10.917
I hope that those who
are far from home

01:11.618 --> 01:13.909
Do not feel too sad.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.971
If there is anything I can do,

01:18.572 --> 01:20.106
I will do it.

03:32.901 --> 03:35.102
I have another piece of
sausage, do you like it?

03:35.103 --> 03:37.154
Oh, yes, thank you.
Just a little bit.

03:38.222 --> 03:41.248
I still can not believe I'm
sitting so close to you.

03:41.249 --> 03:45.007
Really, all my friends
adore his style.

03:48.008 --> 03:50.013
Do you know why they arrested you?

03:50.014 --> 03:52.167
I think it was because
of my boyfriend,

03:52.168 --> 03:53.407
Is in the resistance.

03:53.808 --> 03:54.623
Oh.

03:55.124 --> 03:56.661
I adore him,

03:57.263 --> 03:58.792
His name is Maurice.

03:59.493 --> 04:01.543
Is in the second year
of dental school.

04:03.044 --> 04:04.549
Mine are here,

04:05.550 --> 04:06.904
With relatives.

04:07.905 --> 04:09.429
Oh, France, it's beautiful.

04:09.430 --> 04:11.231
I love France.

04:12.933 --> 04:17.470
Mme. Fénelon his music
is the soul of Paris.

04:17.471 --> 04:18.416
Yes. Yes.

04:18.418 --> 04:19.438
Thank you.

04:26.740 --> 04:29.795
Someone said we will have to
pretend joy when they take us out.

04:29.796 --> 04:30.838
Are you?

04:30.839 --> 04:31.572
Where?

04:31.573 --> 04:33.092
You have to.

04:33.093 --> 04:34.717
I never meant anything to me.

04:34.918 --> 04:36.093
about me.

04:47.232 --> 04:49.233
You really should not eat so much.

04:49.234 --> 04:50.888
Oh, I can not help it.

04:50.889 --> 04:52.519
I never did until
I got arrested.

04:52.554 --> 04:54.644
Since then I have been
hungry all the time.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.665
Can you tell the address?

05:00.366 --> 05:01.509
It's to the north.

05:01.510 --> 05:06.136
Some think it will be Munich,
perhaps as workers on the farms.

05:07.542 --> 05:08.405
Munich?

05:16.387 --> 05:19.582
I'm not sure I can
work on a farm, might?

05:19.583 --> 05:20.848
Have you lived in the country?

05:20.849 --> 05:24.141
No, no, never. She was a student
in my house, my whole life.

05:39.491 --> 05:40.992
He would care, sir.

05:43.148 --> 05:44.144
Change?

05:46.349 --> 05:47.216
He turned east.

05:47.217 --> 05:48.539
To the East?

05:49.040 --> 05:52.089
That can not be right, some
of us know this, Janet.

06:04.488 --> 06:06.988
He cares if we can
stay together.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.041
How old are you?

06:17.542 --> 06:18.491
Twenty.

06:18.992 --> 06:19.958
For real?

06:19.959 --> 06:21.491
If you're so young.

06:40.386 --> 06:42.122
I have to find the shithead.

06:58.214 --> 06:59.714
Why do not you watch what you do?

07:00.115 --> 07:01.523
Come with me.

07:01.524 --> 07:02.432
It's changed.

07:02.433 --> 07:03.755
I almost fainted.

07:05.356 --> 07:07.123
I have to get to the shithead.

07:09.324 --> 07:10.330
Outrageous.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.616
Thank you.

07:11.917 --> 07:12.811
Thank you.

07:28.679 --> 07:29.679
Quiet.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.130
No one is watching.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.025
It was not your fault.

09:12.706 --> 09:15.535
Mrs., Mrs., your husband.

09:27.211 --> 09:28.711
Open the door!

09:29.212 --> 09:31.223
There's a dead man in here.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.142
Open the door!

10:57.203 --> 10:59.203
Come, this is where our things
will be returned to us.

11:13.065 --> 11:14.565
What did you say?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.459
What if this is where our
things will be returned to us?

11:18.460 --> 11:19.419
Take off your coat.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.324
Take off your clothes.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.589
Take off your clothes!

12:49.749 --> 12:51.249
She can keep her hair.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.175
Only shave the Jews.

12:55.476 --> 12:57.563
Look how I look, you Jewish rat.

12:58.864 --> 13:00.932
I'm not a Jewish
rat, I'm French.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.138
For talking!

13:39.244 --> 13:41.244
Where are the people
with whom we came,

13:41.245 --> 13:43.126
The ones on the
Red Cross trucks?

13:46.328 --> 13:47.398
Look...

13:47.499 --> 13:50.523
The "cook".

14:02.567 --> 14:06.111
Mariane, listen to me.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.673
You have to be careful.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.429
Why did they do that?

14:13.631 --> 14:15.671
What do they get?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.655
What is the purpose?

14:26.656 --> 14:31.088
Neither boyfriend would allow me to enter the
resistance because it was too dangerous.

14:40.603 --> 14:42.103
Is that why you did not?

14:43.305 --> 14:45.800
I have been in resistance
for a long time.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.739
There's a dead woman here.

15:29.454 --> 15:30.954
The best at night

15:30.955 --> 15:32.372
When we are alone,

15:32.373 --> 15:34.218
Is to remember everything.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.184
You have to take care of this.

15:40.685 --> 15:43.250
There was once a prince,

15:43.251 --> 15:44.912
Called John,

15:44.913 --> 15:46.936
And was terribly vain.

15:46.971 --> 15:51.009
And he married Princess Couchonet,

15:51.010 --> 15:52.509
Which was very beautiful.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.669
So one day, the prince sent

15:55.670 --> 15:59.699
For her, because she wanted children.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.746
So...

16:03.400 --> 16:04.329
so

16:04.706 --> 16:10.171
They had six children
and five daughters...

16:10.441 --> 16:14.790
And every son had a horse,

16:14.791 --> 16:18.911
And every daughter had a cow.

16:18.912 --> 16:22.810
And when they grew up...

16:22.811 --> 16:28.408
They always took care of each other.

18:03.390 --> 18:07.891
Does anyone know how to sing Madama Butterfly?

18:16.567 --> 18:21.230
Does anyone know how to
sing Madama Butterfly?

18:30.518 --> 18:32.278
She... she can.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.462
Bring it.

19:32.008 --> 19:34.976
I'm Ethanine, I saw her once
in Paris at the Melodie,

19:34.977 --> 19:37.724
My parents took me for
my 17th birthday.

19:37.725 --> 19:40.400
I myself have started to play
professionally this year.

19:40.401 --> 19:43.036
She was the one who
recognized it, it's Michou.

19:43.037 --> 19:45.716
Yesterday I thought I saw
her coming out of her tent.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.779
I begged our custodian
to give him an audition.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.488
For whom is this?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.487
For the officers, for us.

19:52.088 --> 19:55.520
Laura, Laura, come and meet Mme.
Fénelon.

19:56.021 --> 19:57.975
She is one of our
best interpreters.

19:57.976 --> 19:59.903
You can make Brahms solos.

20:01.804 --> 20:05.285
It is an honor for me to meet you.

20:07.286 --> 20:08.805
Is there a Director?

20:08.806 --> 20:10.415
Oh yeah, Mme. Alma Rosé.

20:10.416 --> 20:13.163
His uncle was Gustav Mahler,
the great composer.

20:13.164 --> 20:18.000
He is a fantastic talent, - but
not a warm heart, take care.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.680
Are you Mlle. Fénelon?

20:36.981 --> 20:38.461
Yes madam

20:40.663 --> 20:42.137
Plays the piano?

20:43.238 --> 20:44.774
Yes madam

20:44.775 --> 20:47.905
Let me hear something
about Madama Butterfly.

24:09.929 --> 24:11.429
Will he take it?

24:11.430 --> 24:14.311
Yes, lady, her tones
are very good.

24:14.712 --> 24:15.976
It's marvelous.

24:22.677 --> 24:24.738
Do you know any German music?

24:25.739 --> 24:26.502
Yes.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.410
I am the Lagerfuhrerin Maria Amanda,

24:41.111 --> 24:43.596
Commander of all the
women in this camp.

24:44.497 --> 24:45.247
I...

24:46.649 --> 24:49.601
I forgot to tell Mme. Rosé that...

24:51.502 --> 24:52.373
I...

24:52.374 --> 24:55.394
I can not accept being
in the orchestra

24:55.395 --> 24:57.835
Unless my friend

24:57.836 --> 25:03.086
6W62 can also join
the orchestra.

25:03.087 --> 25:04.800
It has a beautiful voice.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.699
It's in tent B,

25:09.900 --> 25:10.898
unless...

25:11.900 --> 25:13.971
That she may enter,

25:15.773 --> 25:16.531
I...

25:16.532 --> 25:19.516
I must refuse, I'm sorry.

26:30.525 --> 26:33.890
See that they are cleaned,
and sent to the warehouse.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.861
Yes, Mrs. Lagerfuhrerin.

27:27.329 --> 27:28.529
What size?

27:29.531 --> 27:32.368
Number 9, Frau Lagerfuhrerin.
- Nine.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.944
I want boots.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.587
I'm afraid we do not have it.
- Find them!

27:44.068 --> 27:47.568
It should be warm and comfortable
to take care of your voice.

28:12.252 --> 28:13.252
Continue.

28:15.554 --> 28:16.550
Sit down.

28:17.751 --> 28:19.059
From the beginning.

29:22.313 --> 29:23.813
Why so strident?

29:23.814 --> 29:26.013
This is not band music,

29:26.250 --> 29:28.630
We do not touch the wind.

29:31.940 --> 29:34.412
Why can not they obey
my instructions?

29:38.914 --> 29:42.702
Music is the most sacred
activity of humanity,

29:44.859 --> 29:48.393
Must be devoted day and night,

29:48.394 --> 29:50.484
You must listen to yourself,

29:52.424 --> 29:55.085
Should be inspired to achieve some improvement.

29:55.427 --> 30:00.208
They can not just keep
repeating the same stupidity.

30:10.456 --> 30:12.209
Rest, Philharmonic.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.177
I think you altered it.

30:15.578 --> 30:17.545
Well, it's been so good.

30:17.546 --> 30:19.854
Who suddenly realized
how we really sounded.

30:19.855 --> 30:22.250
Well, it was a big crash.

30:22.251 --> 30:24.184
Do not know why we can
not learn that number?

30:24.185 --> 30:26.203
We have to do it as
she indicates it.

30:26.204 --> 30:28.432
And you, you're making them worse.

30:28.633 --> 30:32.282
I've only studied music for
six months in my entire life.

30:32.283 --> 30:35.047
Surely it was not the worst
6 months you've ever spent.

30:35.048 --> 30:37.273
It's not just that we can not mate,

30:37.274 --> 30:39.533
But the teacher has also
gotten into this problem.

30:39.534 --> 30:40.334
Why?

30:40.335 --> 30:42.706
We were just a band of
marches when we started,

30:42.707 --> 30:44.803
To touch the prisoners after
their work assignments

30:44.804 --> 30:45.825
And allowed the band.

30:46.626 --> 30:48.113
Our guards were excited.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.995
Suddenly we found ourselves
playing Bach, Brahms,

30:50.996 --> 30:53.313
Concerts for high metals.

30:53.314 --> 30:55.403
He is a victim of his own pride,

30:55.404 --> 30:57.784
And that's why we have problems now.
- Will they ever feed us?

31:01.485 --> 31:03.972
The last soup will be
served at any time.

31:03.973 --> 31:05.235
I do not want problems.

31:05.236 --> 31:08.303
As soon as the big bosses
came and listened to us

31:08.304 --> 31:10.890
They began to get bored of
hearing the same three numbers.

31:10.891 --> 31:12.938
But we did not have any
other orchestration.

31:12.939 --> 31:16.384
It's just that no composer ever wrote
anything for a group like this.

31:16.385 --> 31:18.156
You happen to not make
instrumentations, do you?

31:18.157 --> 31:21.091
We have performed the same concerts
so many times that the commanders...

31:21.092 --> 31:23.566
Fania, you do not have to instrument,

31:23.567 --> 31:25.994
But you're good at
all sorts of things.

31:28.696 --> 31:30.783
I'll try, I think I can.

31:31.984 --> 31:32.794
Yes

31:32.795 --> 31:35.327
Well, it will not be very professional.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.871
We must tell Madame.

31:43.969 --> 31:44.769
Yes.

31:48.770 --> 31:50.845
We thought you would like to know

31:52.241 --> 31:54.241
Which Fania knows how to implement.

31:55.242 --> 31:57.363
Leave us, leave us.

32:08.892 --> 32:10.392
Tell me the truth Fania.

32:11.093 --> 32:13.578
Yes, I can, I can
not see why not.

32:13.579 --> 32:15.187
I must suppose that he
actually studied it.

32:15.788 --> 32:18.608
Yes, in the conservatory of Paris.

32:19.309 --> 32:20.804
Lucky!

32:21.805 --> 32:23.836
How lucky for you to have Fania.

32:28.438 --> 32:31.443
I've been under terrible pressure
to present something new.

32:31.844 --> 32:33.393
That's what they told me.

32:35.195 --> 32:37.250
You can start with...

32:37.851 --> 32:39.941
I have a piano score
for "Carmen".

32:39.942 --> 32:42.594
Good yes. I guess I
can do "Carmen".

32:42.595 --> 32:44.606
Or something German,

32:44.907 --> 32:46.357
For bone, that of the house.

32:51.459 --> 32:52.510
I know,

32:53.411 --> 32:55.897
But they have done
nothing but Von Suppé.

32:55.898 --> 32:58.873
And we must try to please Fania.

33:01.174 --> 33:03.652
Well, I think that's elementary.

33:03.653 --> 33:05.627
I'd rather believe that
I'm saving my life.

33:05.628 --> 33:08.124
Instead of trying to please S.S.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.144
Do you think you can
do without the other?

33:12.880 --> 33:14.897
Start immediately.

33:15.798 --> 33:19.291
I will need some people
to copy the parts and

33:19.292 --> 33:21.327
Some music paper.

33:21.328 --> 33:23.123
It is not possible to get music paper.

33:23.124 --> 33:25.303
It may not require some.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.366
There is a war going on my dear.

33:28.167 --> 33:31.591
Come on, I'll find some paper,
you draw the lines themselves.

33:33.593 --> 33:34.619
What did he say?

33:34.793 --> 33:35.887
Fania...

33:41.629 --> 33:43.629
I can not help but strive for
the pursuit of perfection,

33:43.630 --> 33:45.748
I was trained that way and
I can not change now.

33:50.558 --> 33:52.558
He is hardly in a position
to criticize her, and

33:52.559 --> 33:54.285
I'm also trying to please her.

33:54.286 --> 33:55.443
Exactly,

33:55.978 --> 33:57.612
But we are artists,

33:58.913 --> 34:00.407
We can not get away from that.

34:01.308 --> 34:03.609
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

34:06.594 --> 34:08.623
Please try to speed up the work,

34:09.524 --> 34:11.928
You will see that they are
very temperamental with us.

34:13.228 --> 34:14.716
Do it soon Fania.

34:16.917 --> 34:17.889
Now.

35:11.752 --> 35:14.762
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

35:14.763 --> 35:16.215
with your permission

35:16.731 --> 35:20.324
A little bit of popular
music with our new member.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.154
Why do you bother
stealing when you know

37:01.155 --> 37:02.744
I can not bear to see you eat so much?

37:02.745 --> 37:04.577
I was just looking for a little taste.

37:04.578 --> 37:06.409
I told you that you could take it.

37:07.824 --> 37:10.912
You should think it's
good to be a little girl,

37:10.913 --> 37:13.310
When are you going to take
care of that situation?

37:13.311 --> 37:16.067
You can not keep expecting
something fantastic to happen.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.269
You have to accept that
this is where you are,

37:17.270 --> 37:19.331
And it is much better
than most prisons.

37:19.332 --> 37:20.391
I will not do it any more.

37:21.192 --> 37:24.202
Is there anyone else you're
doing these things for?

37:24.203 --> 37:27.087
If that's what you
want, then we're done.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.028
Is seriously.

37:30.029 --> 37:32.530
You are welcome to take
everything I have,

37:33.331 --> 37:35.398
I hope you do the same
for me if I'm desperate.

37:35.399 --> 37:37.821
Fania very well that we can
share everything we have.

37:37.822 --> 37:40.280
I have refused to become an
animal for a gram of "something"

37:40.315 --> 37:42.163
Or a piece of potato.

37:42.164 --> 37:45.344
But will not you want to share
with the prebostes as well?

37:45.345 --> 37:47.289
You can share with
those bitches, not me.

37:47.290 --> 37:48.337
Well they are not all like that.

37:48.338 --> 37:50.597
You, you also had a
pet, July, like Fania.

37:50.598 --> 37:53.608
But you are an anti-Semite.
- No, I'm not.

37:53.609 --> 37:56.290
We had many Jewish
friends in the theater.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.389
I am not.

37:58.390 --> 38:00.399
In my opinion Etalina

38:00.400 --> 38:03.039
The public thinks that
you are going to be...

38:03.040 --> 38:07.683
Oh, can you tell? Darling
spells G A S E A D O S.

38:07.684 --> 38:11.229
The point is they want to feel
superior because they probably

38:11.230 --> 38:14.115
Will have to return to their homes
at the end of the war being pagans.

38:14.816 --> 38:16.842
They are more stupid than ever.

38:16.843 --> 38:18.846
Well, then we should
try to educate them.

38:25.195 --> 38:27.195
Fania, Fania,

38:27.196 --> 38:29.046
Tell us about Paris again,

38:29.047 --> 38:30.189
You wore those skirts.

38:30.190 --> 38:34.159
Very elegant, very current,
I always liked flowers.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.898
They are also very tall,
legs are terrible.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.611
You can not wear stockings
because your legs are marked.

38:39.612 --> 38:42.412
My mother would not let me use them.

38:42.413 --> 38:45.701
And her hair, there were women
in a convoy the other day,

38:45.702 --> 38:47.409
I think of Holland,

38:47.410 --> 38:49.403
With loops on top of hair.

38:49.404 --> 38:51.063
Oh yeah, rich girls,

38:51.064 --> 38:52.345
All up.

38:54.947 --> 38:56.438
Where are those women?

38:57.539 --> 38:59.503
Oh, they must have burned them already.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.223
And of songs, do you
know some new ones?

39:02.224 --> 39:03.554
It's strong to say that.

39:03.555 --> 39:04.850
Why not say it?

39:04.851 --> 39:07.469
It is better to be prepared
for when our time comes.

39:11.488 --> 39:13.962
Who sings any of the new songs?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.981
Did you record any record in Paris?

40:55.393 --> 40:56.893
Let's get up.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.020
Fania.

41:06.121 --> 41:08.094
You do not have to do that,
you're in the band now.

41:08.095 --> 41:10.473
I would not want it to be seen
that it is not for prisoners.

43:01.616 --> 43:03.616
I'm so hungry Fania.

43:04.917 --> 43:06.408
What can I do?

43:07.409 --> 43:09.768
Try to think of something else.

43:09.769 --> 43:12.008
Can not you ask Alma something?

43:12.009 --> 43:13.947
Do not be silly, because you
would give me something.

43:13.948 --> 43:15.859
And what am I going to do?

43:15.860 --> 43:16.934
We are all in the same problem.

43:16.935 --> 43:18.872
Why do you expect
me to find food?

43:18.873 --> 43:20.024
I'm not a magician.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.332
Is that all you've done?

43:49.633 --> 43:54.156
At that rate we will wait a hundred
years for you to give us another score.

43:54.157 --> 43:56.464
You can stop annoying, instrument

43:56.465 --> 43:59.160
It is a difficult job,
even for experts.

44:11.313 --> 44:13.314
I have to talk to you.

44:21.308 --> 44:23.308
Why do not you stop...?

44:24.609 --> 44:26.072
Then you lied.

44:26.073 --> 44:27.304
You can not instrument.

44:27.305 --> 44:29.392
I'm very capable of doing
it, I'm sure I can.

44:30.451 --> 44:31.906
What is it then?

44:33.607 --> 44:35.411
One of the women...

44:35.446 --> 44:37.021
this morning...

44:39.501 --> 44:41.131
He spit on me

44:42.533 --> 44:43.401
Yes?

44:47.682 --> 44:52.054
I had not realized how
much they should hate us.

44:54.984 --> 44:57.016
Yes, of course,
what did he expect?

44:57.017 --> 44:58.496
Well, I...

45:01.897 --> 45:03.919
I had not thought about it.

45:05.721 --> 45:08.083
Perhaps you are too aware
of the orchestra's purpose.

45:08.084 --> 45:09.661
No, no, I did not mean...

45:09.662 --> 45:11.445
Do you want to go back to tent B?

45:11.446 --> 45:12.817
Surely that can be fixed.

45:12.818 --> 45:15.403
Master, please, I'm
not criticizing you.

45:18.504 --> 45:22.317
It's just that I'm not used
to being hated this way.

45:26.419 --> 45:27.269
Fania...

45:28.770 --> 45:31.237
In this place there
is life or death.

45:31.238 --> 45:34.746
There is no possibility for
anything else, whatever.

45:39.247 --> 45:41.265
I'm trying to rehearse that piece tomorrow.

45:41.766 --> 45:43.224
I want the parties early.

45:44.525 --> 45:46.064
That, if you can.

45:46.965 --> 45:48.464
You are?

45:50.866 --> 45:53.390
Yes yes I am.

47:43.076 --> 47:44.076
Eat it.

47:47.678 --> 47:49.747
You must go hungry
working all night.

47:57.049 --> 47:58.538
Will not you eat it?

48:01.639 --> 48:04.161
Who gave you the right
to judge anyone?

48:05.362 --> 48:08.621
I'm just trying to keep myself alive,
just like everyone else, just like you.

48:09.821 --> 48:11.642
Or you?

48:16.878 --> 48:18.914
You know what they think of us.

48:20.315 --> 48:23.839
We are no better than the prostitutes
who entertain the murderers.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.867
I know, I'm not judging you.

48:26.868 --> 48:28.505
But if you do, I perceive it from you.

48:28.706 --> 48:30.660
And you have no right.

48:34.362 --> 48:35.286
Eat it.

48:40.188 --> 48:42.232
Well, it does not matter.

48:42.733 --> 48:44.768
Either way we'll live
until we get out of here.

48:44.769 --> 48:46.871
What if we succeeded?

48:46.872 --> 48:49.268
What if we really live?

48:49.269 --> 48:51.927
Everything that means
to me, my dear, is

48:51.928 --> 48:55.730
You try to die, and it's hard to see
that happen and keep your mouth shut.

48:55.731 --> 48:57.242
I'm trying to survive.

48:57.243 --> 48:59.040
Throwing yourself out.

48:59.541 --> 49:03.051
You treat yourself like
a rotten piece of meat.

49:03.052 --> 49:03.927
Shut up.

53:09.477 --> 53:10.977
Do not do that.

53:12.278 --> 53:13.140
What?

53:13.141 --> 53:14.276
Turn around.

53:14.277 --> 53:16.559
You have to look and see everything.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.891
So I can tell when I'm done.

53:20.192 --> 53:20.991
Who?

53:23.793 --> 53:25.801
But I am not a believer.

53:28.602 --> 53:30.620
Why did you choose me?

53:32.021 --> 53:34.430
I always know who to choose.

53:41.132 --> 53:42.030
Live.

54:03.674 --> 54:04.903
Would you let me?

54:05.904 --> 54:10.298
I just want to ask
you about an issue.

54:18.437 --> 54:20.437
What do you know about her?

54:21.038 --> 54:23.841
I see them talking
together sometimes.

54:25.191 --> 54:28.249
Well, she's a militant communist,

54:28.250 --> 54:30.762
She is also engaged to get married.

54:31.045 --> 54:35.323
It's that kind, since we're here
you have plans to survive, why?

54:35.767 --> 54:37.093
I do not know.

54:37.094 --> 54:41.242
It's just... it looks so
different from the others.

54:41.243 --> 54:43.010
So full of courage.

54:43.211 --> 54:45.228
She says the same thing about you.

54:47.854 --> 54:50.801
She... She's talked about me.

54:50.802 --> 54:52.054
Rachel too.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.551
Spatially admire your value,

54:55.652 --> 54:57.483
And your beauty.

55:04.385 --> 55:06.940
She is... she is so beautiful.

55:06.941 --> 55:08.327
Do not you think so?

55:10.128 --> 55:12.219
I love his smile.

55:12.220 --> 55:15.999
It would be all faster if you tell
me what you do not like about it.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.392
I do not understand what's
happening to me, Fania.

55:25.093 --> 55:27.682
I think about her all day.

55:29.684 --> 55:34.570
I just adore everything
she says and does.

55:34.571 --> 55:35.695
Oh, you're in love with her.

55:38.297 --> 55:39.348
Do you think that...

55:39.349 --> 55:40.689
Why not?

55:41.404 --> 55:42.495
They are very young.

55:42.496 --> 55:45.433
When you are so young,
only love matters.

55:49.434 --> 55:51.464
I feel like...

55:52.165 --> 55:54.221
I do not know what it is.

55:58.923 --> 56:00.953
Oh, the human race.

56:01.554 --> 56:03.935
You are laughing at me?

56:05.250 --> 56:07.331
No, for the pure,
everything is purity.

56:07.332 --> 56:09.854
Do not despise yourself.

56:09.855 --> 56:13.056
In this place feeling
something can be a blessing.

56:14.751 --> 56:17.839
Have you ever had
feelings like that Fania?

56:18.640 --> 56:23.058
Never.
Never. With nobody.

56:23.059 --> 56:25.786
Go, let me get some sleep.

56:43.989 --> 56:46.489
What a correct young lady
you should have been.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:21.582
Had I ever heard anything
more moving, Herr Commander?

01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:24.473
Very good, very good, but the
musical opinion of Dr. Méngüele

01:00:24.474 --> 01:00:26.419
Are much more expert, of course.

01:00:33.285 --> 01:00:36.285
I've really been
totally touched.

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:40.906
You must thank the doctor, Fania.

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:55.017
Thank you Doctor.

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:57.280
I must tell you Fénelon that
I originally objected...

01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:59.217
Excuse me Herr commander.

01:00:59.218 --> 01:01:02.833
I must tell you that my
name is not really Fénelon,

01:01:02.834 --> 01:01:04.677
My mother's last name was Fénelon,

01:01:04.678 --> 01:01:07.241
My father's was Goldstein.

01:01:07.242 --> 01:01:09.037
I'm Fania Goldstein.

01:01:18.228 --> 01:01:21.919
Excuse me, I did not intend
to interrupt, Herr Commander.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.088
You must learn to
sing German songs.

01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:28.963
I'll see you begin learning them
immediately, Herr Commander.

01:01:31.164 --> 01:01:34.337
As I was saying, I was
opposed to this idea,

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:35.494
On the orchestra.

01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:37.006
But now I must say

01:01:37.007 --> 01:01:38.273
That a song like that

01:01:38.274 --> 01:01:43.151
It is a comfort that nourishes
the spirit and strengthens us

01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:46.793
For our difficult work.
Very good.

01:02:01.662 --> 01:02:03.663
Fräulein Goldstein,

01:02:10.365 --> 01:02:12.615
Is there anything you need especially?

01:02:18.964 --> 01:02:19.764
Good...

01:02:21.365 --> 01:02:23.076
toothbrush?

01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:26.483
Send it to Canada
for some things.

01:02:28.784 --> 01:02:30.276
With my congratulations.

01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:34.381
To Canada?

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:49.944
Ah the things of the Franchute.

01:02:49.945 --> 01:02:51.713
Very clean.

01:02:53.114 --> 01:02:54.987
Welcome to Canada.

01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:57.478
There you have your filth, stupid.

01:03:13.867 --> 01:03:16.868
You got a toothbrush,
can I see it?

01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:19.124
Oh, it looks almost new.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:23.092
Nothing like having something
imported from France, right?

01:03:23.093 --> 01:03:24.354
Hey what's up?

01:03:24.855 --> 01:03:26.919
What have you got against me?

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.367
Nothing.

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:31.288
It's just that I think
that's not the way

01:03:31.289 --> 01:03:32.668
Correct to act with a superior.

01:03:32.969 --> 01:03:34.552
But when they are the
owners of this place.

01:03:34.553 --> 01:03:36.511
You expect me to congratulate
you on some of the things

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.959
What are you doing these days

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.164
What I am doing?

01:03:39.165 --> 01:03:40.461
Oh, let's forget it.
- All right.

01:03:42.096 --> 01:03:43.514
I personally feel much safer

01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:45.121
Now that Mandel is
so hot with you.

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:47.299
Scared, but I'm grateful,

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.201
Otherwise I would not envy anyone

01:03:49.202 --> 01:03:51.336
That would wake up so close
to that arrogant Nazi.

01:03:51.337 --> 01:03:52.337
There is no danger of that.

01:03:52.338 --> 01:03:53.316
You never know.

01:03:53.818 --> 01:03:56.303
Life does not always leave a
girl a lot to choose from.

01:03:56.304 --> 01:03:57.850
You were not given any alternative

01:03:57.851 --> 01:03:59.851
Considering the companies
you've been maintaining.

01:04:00.052 --> 01:04:01.945
Listen to this skin and bones.

01:04:01.946 --> 01:04:02.868
Well, maybe I am but

01:04:02.869 --> 01:04:04.122
I'll wake up near Mandel

01:04:04.123 --> 01:04:05.645
Sooner than many of you girls.

01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:07.623
That was disgusting, Etalina.

01:04:07.624 --> 01:04:09.490
Mandel is just a killer.

01:04:09.491 --> 01:04:11.530
Even so it's beautiful,
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:04:11.531 --> 01:04:13.719
If you had an ounce of Jewish pride

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.134
You could not call such
a monster beautiful.

01:04:16.135 --> 01:04:18.102
Do not try to make her look ugly.

01:04:18.103 --> 01:04:20.082
Is beautiful.

01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:21.421
It is human.

01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:24.687
What bothers me is

01:04:24.688 --> 01:04:25.867
That a woman

01:04:25.868 --> 01:04:28.072
That is so beautiful

01:04:28.273 --> 01:04:30.428
Can be doing such things.

01:04:30.948 --> 01:04:33.031
We are of the same species.

01:04:33.032 --> 01:04:36.607
That's exactly what makes the
whole situation so black.

01:04:36.608 --> 01:04:38.174
No, there is still hope.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:42.769
Because when this war is over,
Europe will be a communist.

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:45.315
And for that, I want to live.

01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:47.863
No, we'll try to go to Palestine.

01:04:47.864 --> 01:04:50.883
To raise Jewish children in Palestine.

01:04:51.384 --> 01:04:53.945
You do not have any Fania identity.

01:04:53.946 --> 01:04:57.700
And that's why you can call such
a human and beautiful monster.

01:04:58.101 --> 01:04:59.289
I envy you both.

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.601
They will not believe that they have solved the problem?

01:05:01.602 --> 01:05:04.215
What problem ?, I do not see a problem.

01:05:05.616 --> 01:05:07.102
She is human.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.222
Like you, like me.

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:14.925
Do not you think that's a problem?

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.617
What does it matter to you?

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.587
Your hair comes out lighter.

01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:02.247
Go to bed, Maria.

01:06:05.548 --> 01:06:09.102
Well that happens, one of us
was a doctor from Vienna,

01:06:09.103 --> 01:06:11.077
He just went to check it out.

01:06:11.112 --> 01:06:14.356
And I thought we would
never menstruate again.

01:06:14.415 --> 01:06:15.234
Why?

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:20.611
Because of this fear,
every day and night.

01:06:20.612 --> 01:06:23.977
And the food can be sterilized.

01:06:41.462 --> 01:06:42.362
Maria

01:06:44.764 --> 01:06:47.349
You know, it's so weird, but I think

01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:49.508
Maybe you can control your hunger.

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:52.167
If you could share what you get with

01:06:52.168 --> 01:06:53.802
Some other woman, anyone.

01:06:54.203 --> 01:06:56.270
You know, sometimes a person

01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:59.640
Needs the strength that comes
from giving something.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:04.490
Fania...

01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:07.630
about

01:07:08.331 --> 01:07:09.770
To endure.

01:07:22.782 --> 01:07:24.282
Understand me.

01:07:24.283 --> 01:07:25.928
Is a musician.

01:07:25.929 --> 01:07:28.762
Tell them that... it should not be sacrificed.

01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:31.606
To hospital.

01:07:31.607 --> 01:07:33.839
We need it very much.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.339
Well, do you understand me or not?

01:07:37.241 --> 01:07:39.194
Wait, wait.

01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:40.658
Excuse me, Herr Oberstand fuhrer.

01:07:40.659 --> 01:07:41.785
With your permission.

01:07:41.786 --> 01:07:45.857
I could instruct these men that
this woman should not be hurt.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:48.069
It's our cellist, you
should go to the hospital.

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:50.216
High fever, perhaps typhus.

01:07:50.217 --> 01:07:51.291
I do not know what language they speak.

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:56.150
He speaks Italian, Spanish,
Russian, Romanian,

01:07:56.151 --> 01:07:57.578
Is not she fantastic?

01:07:57.579 --> 01:07:59.028
It is very insistent.

01:07:59.029 --> 01:08:02.712
Yes, that is Mala the
head of interpreters.

01:08:02.713 --> 01:08:05.657
She's Jewish, but
she's intimidated.

01:08:05.658 --> 01:08:06.986
How is that possible?

01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:09.152
Mala has been here
longer than anyone else,

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:10.468
Since the field was built.

01:08:10.969 --> 01:08:12.412
She was supposed to be gassed,

01:08:12.413 --> 01:08:14.890
But escaped with
five other girls.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:16.428
Did he actually get out?

01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:19.185
Yes, it started by opening
a ventilation duct,

01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:20.715
Already had managed to pass
the house of the commander,

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:22.474
When he saw them out on the road.

01:08:22.475 --> 01:08:26.710
Guess what Mala did
then, demanded clothes.

01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:28.604
When they spoke, they realized that

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.591
She practically spoke
all languages.

01:08:30.593 --> 01:08:33.096
He is very high in the Belgian resistance.

01:08:33.798 --> 01:08:35.804
He even has a lover here.

01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:37.096
No, you have to be kidding.

01:08:37.098 --> 01:08:38.013
Is not true.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.229
They save people.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:41.353
A few, anyway.

01:08:41.354 --> 01:08:42.957
And help others.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.697
Fania.

01:08:44.698 --> 01:08:47.323
Come, we must work
on Schubert's song.

01:08:51.024 --> 01:08:53.037
You have to practice
the "HRU" sound again,

01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:55.935
Dr. Mengele has a sensitive
ear for language.

01:08:55.935 --> 01:08:56.944
He has required it.

01:09:20.915 --> 01:09:23.073
I hope she's never stupid
enough to cover up a language.

01:09:23.774 --> 01:09:25.274
Well, from the beginning.

01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:42.412
Excuse me Madam, meet Mala.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:46.737
Yes very good.

01:09:47.438 --> 01:09:49.926
How did you manage to
make yourself respected?

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:53.732
Well, it's extremely
useful, of course.

01:09:53.767 --> 01:09:55.634
Speak fluently 9
or 10 languages,

01:09:55.635 --> 01:09:57.531
And with so many
nationalities in the camp

01:09:57.532 --> 01:09:59.264
Makes it possible to communicate.

01:10:00.165 --> 01:10:01.672
Is that all?

01:10:01.673 --> 01:10:03.318
It even seems...

01:10:03.319 --> 01:10:05.766
That overwhelms them.
Is incredible.

01:10:07.857 --> 01:10:10.428
Mala is one of those people
whose superiority is clear.

01:10:10.829 --> 01:10:12.354
Even for the ignorant.

01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:15.207
Bad is...

01:10:16.608 --> 01:10:17.741
Miraculous

01:10:18.112 --> 01:10:20.930
Raising a shield among
those kind of people,

01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:24.453
Like the cloth around
the precious seeds.

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:28.157
It is everyone's hope here.

01:10:30.558 --> 01:10:34.617
Even those Nazis perceive
that kind of glory in it.

01:10:37.419 --> 01:10:38.907
She is a miracle.

01:11:01.013 --> 01:11:02.513
Are you trying to destroy us?

01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:05.087
That was a high octave.
Do you know what is tall or not?

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:08.443
I asked if you know what the
octaves are tall or not?

01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:48.484
They should try harder.

01:11:48.942 --> 01:11:51.995
As things stand, Dr. Mengele
hardly bears listening to us,

01:11:51.996 --> 01:11:54.203
If we come down from a certain
level, anything can happen.

01:11:55.104 --> 01:11:57.206
He is a vile and variable man.

01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:00.957
The truth is...

01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:02.170
If it were not for my reputation

01:12:02.171 --> 01:12:03.997
They would have roasted them long ago.

01:12:05.684 --> 01:12:08.181
My father was the first violin
of the Vienna Philharmonic,

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:11.716
His string quartet played
all over the world.

01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:15.422
My own "Viennese Waltzing Girls"
They played in most of Europe.

01:12:15.423 --> 01:12:16.789
I know that.

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:19.502
For I am a Rosé and I am directing...

01:12:20.538 --> 01:12:22.325
A group of prisoners.

01:12:23.858 --> 01:12:26.240
So, why do they resent me?

01:12:27.789 --> 01:12:29.283
You are professional,

01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:32.488
Knows that strict
discipline is required,

01:12:33.589 --> 01:12:35.629
The director must be respected.

01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:37.726
I think it can also be loved.

01:12:37.727 --> 01:12:40.832
He can not love what
is not respected!

01:12:42.934 --> 01:12:44.993
It is perfectly traditional,

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:46.710
In Austria, in Germany,
when a musician is

01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:48.182
Repeatedly wrong...
- Slapping?

01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:49.274
Yes of course.

01:12:50.175 --> 01:12:53.692
Furtwängler did it very often but
his orchestras idolized him.

01:12:59.094 --> 01:13:00.949
I need your support, Fania.

01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:07.161
I realize that they respect her,

01:13:07.162 --> 01:13:09.156
Must support what they claim to them.

01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:12.186
We must constantly raise the
level of our execution,

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:17.588
Or, I really do not know how
long they will bear us.

01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:22.564
Will you help me?

01:13:25.065 --> 01:13:26.096
It will?

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.810
I'm going to tell you the truth,

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:38.532
I really do not know how
long I can bear this.

01:13:38.533 --> 01:13:40.188
I'm trying the best I can.

01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:42.220
And I'll keep trying.

01:13:42.921 --> 01:13:44.946
But sometimes I get the impression

01:13:44.947 --> 01:13:47.433
Of which parts of
me are collapsing.

01:13:47.434 --> 01:13:50.485
And believe me,

01:13:50.486 --> 01:13:53.935
I recognize that it is about
their strength, probably,

01:13:53.936 --> 01:13:56.333
That our lives depend on.

01:13:56.334 --> 01:13:58.275
So why do they resent me?

01:14:01.288 --> 01:14:02.836
I do not know.

01:14:02.837 --> 01:14:06.790
I guess... maybe...
It is simply that

01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:11.564
When a monster keeps
something in reserve,

01:14:11.565 --> 01:14:15.962
We can not, we can not really
dedicate ourselves to please them.

01:14:15.963 --> 01:14:17.512
But he has to want
to please them,

01:14:17.513 --> 01:14:19.298
And with all his heart.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:23.011
You are an artist who can only
propose to give the best of herself.

01:14:26.013 --> 01:14:28.078
But when you look
through the window...

01:14:28.079 --> 01:14:31.336
That's why I told you not
to look out the window.

01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:33.036
Fania was wrong,

01:14:33.037 --> 01:14:35.186
Seems to believe that I have stopped seeing.

01:14:36.187 --> 01:14:38.582
I refused to look.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.172
Before they brought me here,

01:14:44.773 --> 01:14:47.159
Had begun to love,

01:14:50.173 --> 01:14:51.216
To a young man,

01:14:52.217 --> 01:14:53.713
Come as me

01:14:58.015 --> 01:15:00.056
He is now a soldier in the Wehrmacht.

01:15:01.657 --> 01:15:03.756
The three best months of my life...

01:15:12.974 --> 01:15:14.974
The three best months of my life.

01:15:17.676 --> 01:15:20.227
Oh. He wanted me, like a coat.

01:15:23.128 --> 01:15:25.144
Then I was arrested for being a Jewess.

01:15:27.845 --> 01:15:30.048
It still surprises me.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.944
Why is she also German?

01:15:36.045 --> 01:15:38.412
Yes, I am, German.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.836
In this place Fania,

01:15:45.837 --> 01:15:47.712
You will have to be an artist,

01:15:47.713 --> 01:15:50.497
And only artist.

01:15:51.598 --> 01:15:55.144
You will have to concentrate
on one thing only,

01:15:55.802 --> 01:16:00.656
And it is the creation of all the
beauty that it is capable of creating.

01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:10.890
Excuse me.

01:18:08.503 --> 01:18:09.503
Attention!

01:18:09.904 --> 01:18:10.941
Get Aligned!

01:18:19.656 --> 01:18:21.156
Jews on the left.

01:18:21.157 --> 01:18:22.339
Aririos on the right.

01:18:24.841 --> 01:18:26.785
She and I are only half.

01:18:28.186 --> 01:18:30.002
Half what?

01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:31.829
Middle Jews.

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:34.196
Our mothers were Aryan,

01:18:34.797 --> 01:18:37.839
Mestizos are not meant to
be gassed, Frau Schmidt.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.915
I am completely sure.

01:18:38.916 --> 01:18:41.733
Why, if I may ask,
is this selection?

01:18:44.834 --> 01:18:46.864
You belong to the Jews.

01:18:51.665 --> 01:18:53.614
Get ready to sing.

01:18:54.665 --> 01:18:56.732
Nobody wants to end
their lives this time.

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:57.628
Move!

01:19:01.873 --> 01:19:04.374
Half Jews, follow me.

01:19:12.596 --> 01:19:16.914
In that case they are allowed to
cut the top half of the star.

01:19:24.616 --> 01:19:26.617
Was that proposal correct?

01:19:26.618 --> 01:19:29.236
It is disgusting to cut the
star of David in half.

01:19:29.237 --> 01:19:30.002
Why not?

01:19:30.003 --> 01:19:31.304
If we can avoid the gas.

01:19:33.806 --> 01:19:35.870
Disgusting are you.
Jewish nationalists,

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.658
Since when they are custodians
of the principles...

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.655
Do not you dare get
into your traps.

01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:45.325
Your discomfort does not impress me,

01:19:45.326 --> 01:19:47.716
Because you accepted even
greater humiliation,

01:19:47.717 --> 01:19:49.031
Without a gesture.

01:19:49.032 --> 01:19:50.466
We are just a convenience.

01:19:53.267 --> 01:19:56.857
The blood of innocent Jews
cries out for their betrayal.

01:19:57.358 --> 01:19:59.885
Why do not they just shut up?

01:20:00.286 --> 01:20:02.353
I'm sick of Jews and heathens,

01:20:02.354 --> 01:20:03.944
The Westerners, the Orientals,

01:20:03.945 --> 01:20:06.187
The Germans, the non-Germans,

01:20:06.188 --> 01:20:07.810
The French, the non-French,

01:20:07.811 --> 01:20:11.618
I'm tired, I'm tired...
I'm sick

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:15.851
I am a woman, not a tribe.

01:20:15.852 --> 01:20:17.685
And I have been humiliated,

01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:19.072
That's all I know.

01:20:22.173 --> 01:20:24.003
You're all just jealous,

01:20:24.004 --> 01:20:26.230
Anyway they also educated
us as Catholics,

01:20:26.631 --> 01:20:29.098
After all, our mothers
were Catholic.

01:20:44.995 --> 01:20:46.995
What are you doing that for?

01:20:50.097 --> 01:20:50.993
Fania...

01:20:51.928 --> 01:20:53.700
I do not know.

01:20:56.153 --> 01:20:58.168
I'm doing.

01:20:59.569 --> 01:21:02.059
That's right, I'm doing it.

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:20.575
Fania.

01:21:26.177 --> 01:21:29.220
In front of you, up at the door.

01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:34.800
Thank you.

01:21:34.801 --> 01:21:40.496
Fania, they are gassing
12,000 every day now.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:44.647
12,000 angels,

01:21:44.848 --> 01:21:46.873
Flying above.

01:21:48.574 --> 01:21:49.864
Every day.

01:21:51.465 --> 01:21:54.473
Why do you keep telling
me these things?

01:21:54.774 --> 01:21:56.196
What do you want from me?

01:21:56.197 --> 01:21:57.580
Look over your eyes,

01:21:57.581 --> 01:22:00.466
The air is full of angels.

01:22:09.176 --> 01:22:10.676
Two more cigarettes,

01:22:10.877 --> 01:22:12.888
You took more time this time.

01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:15.780
I'm broken, I'll give
it to you next time.

01:22:25.049 --> 01:22:28.049
At least share some of
what you get with others.

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:28.928
For your own good,

01:22:28.929 --> 01:22:31.825
So that you do not end up
becoming a complete animal.

01:22:33.514 --> 01:22:34.531
Jealous?

01:24:22.338 --> 01:24:23.839
All present, Herr Captain.

01:24:26.222 --> 01:24:27.722
Do you know who Mala is?

01:24:29.223 --> 01:24:30.770
Bad, not very good,

01:24:30.771 --> 01:24:32.757
I have seen her, of course,
she has accompanied me with

01:24:32.758 --> 01:24:34.991
With the commander, Herr Captain,

01:24:34.992 --> 01:24:35.997
As an interpreter.

01:24:42.735 --> 01:24:45.236
He has not had any contact
with his musicians.

01:24:45.237 --> 01:24:47.128
No, Herr Captain,

01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:50.001
She has visited the
barracks for not recently.

01:25:31.345 --> 01:25:32.090
Attention!

01:25:41.909 --> 01:25:43.409
Mala escaped.

01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:44.553
And he helped two.

01:25:45.154 --> 01:25:47.239
They got SS uniforms,

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.805
Somehow and flew.

01:25:51.908 --> 01:25:53.408
What a romance!

01:25:54.572 --> 01:25:57.572
Imagine, the two together.

01:26:01.268 --> 01:26:04.233
I saw him once, he
is a good fighter,

01:26:04.234 --> 01:26:07.293
Blond with beautiful white teeth.

01:26:07.294 --> 01:26:08.889
She is Belgian, like me.

01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:12.783
What a Belgian, she is
Jewish like all of us.

01:26:12.784 --> 01:26:16.181
Eric is Polish, and they are going to
tell the world what is going on here.

01:26:16.182 --> 01:26:19.325
Imagine, they could have
exploded that chimney.

01:26:19.326 --> 01:26:22.810
Listen, listen, let's
play something for them.

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:23.587
Oh yeah.

01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:45.099
Allies land France.

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:47.850
Silence now,

01:26:47.851 --> 01:26:49.881
I have corrections.

01:26:49.882 --> 01:26:53.772
Paulette, on page 5, letter B, you
will do it in D sharp instead of...

01:27:10.699 --> 01:27:11.499
Etalin...

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.551
Those are not Jews, they are Poles.

01:27:13.552 --> 01:27:15.357
Hitler said he was going
to kill all the Poles

01:27:15.358 --> 01:27:17.192
To make room for
the Germans there.

01:27:17.193 --> 01:27:20.692
But there must be thousands, they
would never kill so many Aryans.

01:27:20.693 --> 01:27:22.555
What are they going to do with them?

01:27:22.556 --> 01:27:24.572
I think they're going to
put them in these stalls.

01:27:36.375 --> 01:27:37.280
Ladislaus,

01:27:43.482 --> 01:27:44.322
Ladislaus...

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:05.073
It's not beautiful?

01:28:10.975 --> 01:28:12.983
What happens to them?

01:28:13.484 --> 01:28:14.946
Is nothing.

01:28:14.947 --> 01:28:16.427
Frau Lagerfuhrerin.

01:28:16.428 --> 01:28:20.634
There is a rumor that these Polish Aryans
were going to put them in our barracks.

01:28:21.774 --> 01:28:23.797
No way, Madame.

01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:29.698
In fact I can tell you that there will
be no more selections in our field.

01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:35.191
Of course, there is no
room for newcomers,

01:28:38.092 --> 01:28:40.096
There will be other instances.

01:29:06.201 --> 01:29:07.612
Oh, look here.

01:29:09.313 --> 01:29:10.254
Check it out.

01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:14.921
And now...

01:29:14.922 --> 01:29:18.185
Let's get you a nice
new suit, some shoes

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.868
And a sweet little friend.
Come with me.

01:29:24.469 --> 01:29:26.057
Work hard now.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.140
So he's a human
being, after all.

01:29:37.141 --> 01:29:39.834
Is she? But where is the mother?

01:29:39.835 --> 01:29:42.729
Even so, in a way,

01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:45.609
I want to say that at least
he adores the child.

01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:49.709
What is going on here?

01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:50.440
Everything she said...

01:29:50.441 --> 01:29:54.993
What was that he say?
And suddenly it is human.

01:29:56.995 --> 01:29:59.426
What is going on here?

01:30:02.727 --> 01:30:04.214
From the beginning.

01:30:04.716 --> 01:30:05.608
Come on.

01:34:23.079 --> 01:34:24.079
We are going to...

01:34:26.881 --> 01:34:27.693
Attention!

01:34:30.994 --> 01:34:35.093
The officers have decided to keep the piano
in their club for the use of its members.

01:34:35.094 --> 01:34:36.717
Can you handle it without him?

01:34:36.718 --> 01:34:39.612
Yes, of course, Herr commander.

01:34:39.613 --> 01:34:42.694
It was just a little extra
sound, but it's not mandatory.

01:34:42.695 --> 01:34:45.065
What is Greta, the Dutch girl?

01:34:47.667 --> 01:34:48.495
In front!

01:34:52.996 --> 01:34:54.463
Open your mouth.

01:34:55.664 --> 01:34:57.735
Do you have any illness?

01:34:57.736 --> 01:34:59.810
No, no, Herr Commander.

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:02.940
Dr. Mengele told me that he
is not a very good musician.

01:35:03.841 --> 01:35:07.356
No, not very good, but
not very bad either.

01:35:07.357 --> 01:35:08.948
But he works very hard...

01:35:08.949 --> 01:35:11.246
But could it be handled without it?

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.159
Why?

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.509
Yes, of course, Herr commander.

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:20.259
My wife needs someone to look
after our little daughters.

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:21.976
You are coming with me.

01:35:25.478 --> 01:35:28.742
He will play in the hospital for
the sick and the mental patients,

01:35:28.743 --> 01:35:30.346
You will have ready to Beethoven.

01:35:30.347 --> 01:35:33.015
Yes, Herr Commander,

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:37.216
I must ask for your tolerance, if I may.

01:35:38.117 --> 01:35:40.140
Our cellist has typhus,

01:35:40.141 --> 01:35:45.250
And now without the piano too, we may sound
rather deficient in the bass records.

01:35:45.251 --> 01:35:47.772
I'll send one of the men's
orchestra cellists,

01:35:47.773 --> 01:35:50.060
Have several from the Berlin Philharmonic.

01:35:50.061 --> 01:35:52.443
He can train one of his
violinists for Sunday.

01:35:54.645 --> 01:35:58.704
Well... of course Herr commander

01:35:58.705 --> 01:36:03.433
I'm sure she can teach one
of the girls for Sunday.

01:36:03.434 --> 01:36:04.171
Yes.

01:36:07.272 --> 01:36:10.649
It will be very interesting Madame, Dr.
Mengele.

01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:13.540
Wants to observe the effect
of music on the insane.

01:36:13.575 --> 01:36:17.068
Ahh. We will really do our best.

01:36:30.670 --> 01:36:32.643
And how have you been these days?

01:36:33.444 --> 01:36:35.464
I'm quite well.

01:36:37.365 --> 01:36:42.393
Of course, we, all of us
have been very hungry,

01:36:42.394 --> 01:36:43.578
most of the time.

01:36:43.579 --> 01:36:45.412
And that makes it very difficult.

01:36:46.814 --> 01:36:49.413
I offered to send two additional rations, but

01:36:49.414 --> 01:36:51.874
Mme. Rosé believed that
you had to win them,

01:36:52.475 --> 01:36:54.333
As a reward.

01:36:57.034 --> 01:36:58.574
Would not you agree?

01:37:06.844 --> 01:37:12.374
It's not me who has to agree or
not, without being the director.

01:37:15.976 --> 01:37:17.452
Close the door.

01:37:21.653 --> 01:37:23.750
How dare he make such a comment?

01:37:25.051 --> 01:37:27.418
I do not understand, I just
told him we were hungry.

01:37:27.419 --> 01:37:29.012
When they can interpret a simple piece

01:37:29.013 --> 01:37:31.426
Without making a mistake, I will
recommend the extra ration,

01:37:31.427 --> 01:37:33.332
But I'll decide that,
you understand?

01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:38.308
There can not be two leaders.

01:37:39.009 --> 01:37:41.099
Do you agree or not?

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.444
Are you upset?

01:37:43.445 --> 01:37:47.502
We're hungry, that's
what I was saying.

01:37:47.503 --> 01:37:51.099
In this situation we
lose human feelings,

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:52.457
She asked and I told her.

01:37:53.259 --> 01:37:55.300
I think we understand
each other.

01:37:57.601 --> 01:37:59.088
That's all for now.

01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:05.109
Yes, whats up?

01:38:06.610 --> 01:38:07.376
Nothing.

01:38:07.678 --> 01:38:10.766
I'm really trying to
decide if I should leave.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.681
Oh, come on, Fania, nobody lets
himself die if he can help it.

01:38:16.982 --> 01:38:19.498
You should try to be more
honest with yourself.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.653
Go away.

01:38:49.078 --> 01:38:50.578
It's here.

01:38:50.579 --> 01:38:52.850
The cellist of the male orchestra.

01:39:38.952 --> 01:39:40.881
Paulette! Paulette!

01:39:42.282 --> 01:39:43.653
Good to see you.

01:39:51.456 --> 01:39:53.245
Do you want to say something? What is it?

01:39:53.938 --> 01:39:58.361
You're going to play on Sunday...
- At the hospital.

01:40:00.289 --> 01:40:01.809
You do not look good...
- Silence.

01:40:05.489 --> 01:40:06.904
They have planned...

01:40:08.705 --> 01:40:12.283
Gassing... all patients,

01:40:12.284 --> 01:40:14.629
After the concert.

01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:17.892
How did you know that?

01:40:19.393 --> 01:40:21.461
One of the women of the SS

01:40:21.462 --> 01:40:24.750
She warned me, I met her once.

01:40:25.444 --> 01:40:28.436
I used to be a
waitress in our house.

01:40:29.272 --> 01:40:31.309
So I left.

01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:35.924
Paulette, welcome.

01:40:38.526 --> 01:40:40.619
We were desperate for you.

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.734
We do Beethoven's
fifth on Sunday.

01:40:42.735 --> 01:40:45.858
Mme. He could lie down for a while.

01:40:45.859 --> 01:40:47.028
Do not.

01:40:48.329 --> 01:40:49.212
Do not.

01:40:50.813 --> 01:40:52.815
I... I... I can.

01:40:58.417 --> 01:40:59.964
Let's start.

01:41:04.165 --> 01:41:05.675
From the beginning.

01:41:57.946 --> 01:41:58.746
I believe...

01:42:02.947 --> 01:42:04.191
that I...

01:42:05.278 --> 01:42:07.475
I saw my mother yesterday

01:42:10.297 --> 01:42:14.343
My three sisters and my father.

01:42:16.044 --> 01:42:19.514
What? Where?
What are you talking about?

01:42:21.816 --> 01:42:22.739
Yesterday...

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.560
The last convoy of Bucharest...

01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:33.511
The mirror, when we played outside,

01:42:33.912 --> 01:42:35.362
A train arrived,

01:42:37.163 --> 01:42:38.184
Look...

01:42:40.185 --> 01:42:42.762
And... I was not...

01:42:44.563 --> 01:42:46.984
I was not sure.

01:42:53.486 --> 01:42:55.557
But what could you do?

01:43:12.961 --> 01:43:15.204
Does it bother you to wash?

01:43:31.126 --> 01:43:31.949
Thank you,

01:43:33.201 --> 01:43:36.072
Fania, I am tormented,

01:43:36.107 --> 01:43:39.501
About whether I should have
warned the other patients

01:43:39.502 --> 01:43:41.712
About what was going to happen to them.

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.011
What you think?

01:43:46.212 --> 01:43:49.291
Except that he would
let them know.

01:43:49.992 --> 01:43:52.483
I no longer have any anxiety Paulette,

01:43:52.484 --> 01:43:53.994
I live from minute to minute,

01:43:53.995 --> 01:43:55.689
My heart beats, so I'm alive,

01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:57.942
But I'm filling up with dust.

01:44:01.313 --> 01:44:02.234
Go to sleep.

01:44:57.854 --> 01:44:58.654
American people.

01:45:05.856 --> 01:45:07.924
Hope for you Fania.

01:45:11.126 --> 01:45:14.145
Maybe it's too late for the
whole human race, Varya.

01:45:53.566 --> 01:45:56.239
So after all it will end.

01:46:03.969 --> 01:46:07.011
Everyone comes to tell you
their problems, does not it?

01:46:12.413 --> 01:46:14.429
I do not know why they tell me.

01:46:18.015 --> 01:46:20.089
You're someone to trust, Fania.

01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:24.018
Maybe it's because you
have no ideology,

01:46:24.619 --> 01:46:26.661
And you are satisfied with being a person.

01:46:28.762 --> 01:46:31.330
There is so much feeling in you.

01:46:33.332 --> 01:46:34.850
It was that way, yes.

01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:38.485
But you can not cross my
hands with my fingernails,

01:46:38.486 --> 01:46:39.879
To be able to face me with
such strong material.

01:46:40.881 --> 01:46:42.394
That's the truth.

01:46:43.595 --> 01:46:45.666
I'm dying to pieces.

01:46:45.667 --> 01:46:50.167
I know. Very well, I seem
to be, too, too, too...

01:46:52.768 --> 01:46:55.858
It's making it harder
for me to eat anything.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:07.524
I am one of the most successful
actresses in Poland,

01:47:08.782 --> 01:47:10.739
My father was an earl,

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.761
I was born in a castle.

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.814
I have a husband and...

01:47:17.815 --> 01:47:21.440
Narok, my son is 9 years old.

01:47:22.693 --> 01:47:26.711
I do not know what will happen to us,
Fania, you know, before the end.

01:47:29.412 --> 01:47:32.335
I just want a Jewish
woman to understand...

01:47:34.851 --> 01:47:35.815
When they first brought me here,

01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:38.697
I was sure that the Pope
and the Christian leaders

01:47:38.698 --> 01:47:39.725
Who did not know.

01:47:39.726 --> 01:47:42.695
When they found out they were
going to send planes to bomb

01:47:42.696 --> 01:47:46.839
The incinerators and the trains
that bring them here every day.

01:47:47.741 --> 01:47:52.173
But the trains kept coming and
the incinerators burning.

01:47:53.174 --> 01:47:54.965
Do you understand?

01:47:56.066 --> 01:47:57.555
Do you understand?

01:48:00.156 --> 01:48:02.617
Perhaps there is something more important to them.

01:48:02.618 --> 01:48:04.604
So that we are here, in any way,

01:48:04.605 --> 01:48:06.497
A group of women who can
not even menstruate

01:48:06.498 --> 01:48:08.079
Innocent people who frighten men.

01:48:10.981 --> 01:48:14.041
Oh, Fania, please forgive me.

01:48:23.443 --> 01:48:24.259
Your...

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.568
Why?

01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:32.880
What did you do to me?

01:48:34.888 --> 01:48:37.530
Were you in the resistance?

01:48:37.839 --> 01:48:40.322
Did you try to fight
against this?

01:48:40.323 --> 01:48:42.281
Why do you have to feel guilty?

01:48:45.282 --> 01:48:47.706
Confide it, or it will destroy us.

01:48:48.107 --> 01:48:50.642
If you survive you feel that you are innocent.

01:48:54.844 --> 01:48:56.756
Everything is a joke,

01:48:58.128 --> 01:48:59.392
You do not see it.

01:49:02.394 --> 01:49:03.901
Has no sense.

01:49:07.202 --> 01:49:10.182
I'm afraid nothing you would have
done would have changed that.

01:49:24.317 --> 01:49:27.817
I almost feel more sorrow for
people like you than for us,

01:49:28.618 --> 01:49:30.651
And you, you will survive.

01:49:31.953 --> 01:49:34.524
All those around you
will be in sin,

01:49:36.525 --> 01:49:38.555
From one end to the other.

01:49:39.756 --> 01:49:43.845
And those with whom you
can never speak again.

01:49:51.247 --> 01:49:53.792
My memory falls to pieces,
- Did We Go?

01:49:53.827 --> 01:49:55.558
Were we Russian last night?
Did we go?

01:50:05.085 --> 01:50:07.182
You dropped the milk, Yakovska.

01:50:07.283 --> 01:50:08.820
Was mine.

01:50:09.421 --> 01:50:10.926
But still.

01:50:10.927 --> 01:50:13.484
Our farm is 10
kilometers from here.

01:50:13.485 --> 01:50:14.901
They bring it to me.

01:50:14.902 --> 01:50:16.064
My sister.

01:50:17.165 --> 01:50:19.222
But still.
To throw it that way...

01:50:19.223 --> 01:50:22.072
Are you saying it's not my milk?

01:50:30.174 --> 01:50:31.666
Do not worry.

01:50:35.367 --> 01:50:36.931
Do not worry.

01:50:37.532 --> 01:50:41.111
You read too many books.
They drive you crazy.

01:51:06.815 --> 01:51:07.683
Fania.

01:51:09.685 --> 01:51:11.709
I leave for "Baselhauser" on Sunday.

01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:15.880
They send me on a tour
to play for the troops.

01:51:17.081 --> 01:51:19.498
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

01:51:22.199 --> 01:51:26.017
I'm going to be released, Fania.
Can you imagine?

01:51:27.018 --> 01:51:30.106
I will touch what I like,
and how I like it.

01:51:32.007 --> 01:51:35.546
They say that a musician of my
talent should not be wasted here.

01:51:38.848 --> 01:51:42.349
What is the problem?
I thought he would be happy for me.

01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:45.666
Well, yes, I am.
Of course.

01:51:45.667 --> 01:51:49.728
But, while he is playing, he will continue to
fight because he does not enslave us. It will?

01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:51.796
But that's not the point.

01:51:51.797 --> 01:51:54.847
I'll be playing for soldiers, Fania.

01:51:54.848 --> 01:51:57.791
And what about us?
Will we continue? Will we?

01:51:57.792 --> 01:52:00.437
I intend to suggest
that you replace me.

01:52:03.138 --> 01:52:04.582
Oh well...

01:52:04.583 --> 01:52:09.165
I hope that soon we will follow...
before ..

01:52:11.104 --> 01:52:13.676
Why are you trying to
ruin my happiness?

01:52:14.277 --> 01:52:16.345
I will be playing
for honorable men.

01:52:18.046 --> 01:52:20.629
Not for murderers
like these here.

01:52:20.630 --> 01:52:22.281
Soldiers risk their lives.

01:52:22.282 --> 01:52:24.722
Why do you need my
approval if you are happy?

01:52:24.723 --> 01:52:25.723
Enjoy your happiness.

01:52:25.724 --> 01:52:27.454
Not all Germans are Nazis.

01:52:27.455 --> 01:52:29.224
You're just a racist
if you think so.

01:52:33.626 --> 01:52:35.092
I agree.

01:52:36.093 --> 01:52:37.607
It is an extraordinary honor,

01:52:37.608 --> 01:52:42.202
The only Jew who will play the
violin for the Germans in the army,

01:52:42.203 --> 01:52:44.631
my head is going to explode!

01:52:46.232 --> 01:52:47.188
Frau Schmidt

01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.999
Only for...

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.944
Just to extend my
congratulations.

01:53:00.046 --> 01:53:02.056
I just heard the big news.

01:53:04.557 --> 01:53:05.486
Thank you.

01:53:05.887 --> 01:53:07.350
Thank you, Frau Schmidt.

01:53:09.251 --> 01:53:12.330
It is very touching for
me, coming from you.

01:53:14.132 --> 01:53:18.068
Well, I've never been known
to hide my feelings.

01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:23.756
He'll join us for
dinner tonight.

01:53:24.457 --> 01:53:26.918
It's a farewell
dinner in his honor.

01:53:28.419 --> 01:53:31.466
I'm overwhelmed, Frau
Schmidt, of course.

01:53:33.467 --> 01:53:36.995
In short, "in a shoe minister"

01:53:45.031 --> 01:53:49.414
In my rooms, yes.
- I will be there. Thank you.

01:53:49.615 --> 01:53:51.635
Thank you, Frau Schmidt.

01:53:56.536 --> 01:53:58.687
Do not you realize?, really...

01:53:58.688 --> 01:54:03.195
That woman, that woman...

01:54:03.196 --> 01:54:06.869
He has tried everything to
be transferred from here.

01:54:07.670 --> 01:54:10.235
Yeah, she's desperate to get out of here.

01:54:10.236 --> 01:54:16.116
And he has the kindness to come
to wish me well in my departure.

01:54:18.517 --> 01:54:21.554
Well, that's certainly something I
would never have expected from her.

01:54:23.055 --> 01:54:26.083
It is amazing what is
in the human heart.

01:54:26.484 --> 01:54:28.016
You judge people, Fania,

01:54:28.017 --> 01:54:30.336
You are terribly strict.

01:54:31.237 --> 01:54:34.721
Beware of that charm, maybe
they are losing the war.

01:54:34.722 --> 01:54:37.870
So... - Why does everything
have to have war inside?

01:54:40.396 --> 01:54:43.146
Why can not you accept
the little hope in life?

01:54:46.714 --> 01:54:48.259
I'm all confused.

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:51.638
That Schmidt wants it to go
well is really inconceivable.

01:54:51.639 --> 01:54:54.901
Alma, she's getting rich
in the black market,

01:54:54.936 --> 01:54:57.047
Has stolen every woman
who has come here.

01:54:57.048 --> 01:54:59.237
His hand is in everything
that moves in this place.

01:55:00.038 --> 01:55:01.494
I'm going there Fania.

01:55:05.095 --> 01:55:08.176
If I do not have another chance, I
would like to thank you for your help.

01:55:20.258 --> 01:55:23.291
It is totally wrong about
practically everything,

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.839
I must say that you
probably saved our lives,

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.514
So I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

01:55:34.415 --> 01:55:37.508
You can thank him that I
refused to despair, Fania.

01:55:39.809 --> 01:55:41.877
That's true, is not it?

01:59:52.489 --> 01:59:53.489
What happened?

01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:56.325
Schmidt poisoned her, at dinner.

01:59:57.326 --> 01:59:58.864
But you can not know?

01:59:58.865 --> 02:00:00.223
She was shot this morning.

02:00:02.424 --> 02:00:03.359
Schmidt?

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.822
No one was going to leave here
unless she could, especially a Jew.

02:00:06.823 --> 02:00:08.062
You mean I wanted her dead?

02:00:08.063 --> 02:00:10.303
She wrote her epitaph, Why not?

02:00:28.725 --> 02:00:31.054
No no no.
Order, order

02:00:31.126 --> 02:00:33.705
Tanya, what are you rehearsing for?
Now, move.

02:00:33.784 --> 02:00:36.086
No, I'm not leaving.
- Let me stop the rehearsal.

02:00:36.685 --> 02:00:37.616
Come on.

02:00:37.617 --> 02:00:38.432
Mariane,

02:00:38.433 --> 02:00:40.638
Do not touch it like that.

02:00:40.639 --> 02:00:41.942
Now, listen to me.

02:00:44.043 --> 02:00:47.067
Now I am the director and ordered
you to stop interfering.

02:02:22.570 --> 02:02:24.571
Fania, Fania...

02:02:40.279 --> 02:02:42.279
With the executioner?

02:02:54.603 --> 02:02:57.103
Did he kill Mala and Edic?

02:02:57.304 --> 02:02:58.777
You know that?

02:02:59.478 --> 02:03:03.267
Well, if he did not, someone else
would have, you can be sure of that.

02:03:07.568 --> 02:03:09.626
I want to tell you that there is something...

02:03:09.627 --> 02:03:13.190
On which side do you think they are?

02:03:15.391 --> 02:03:20.582
Because if someone is not sure, they
are on the side of the executioners.

02:03:21.383 --> 02:03:26.857
Come out, ask any
prisoners in this camp.

02:03:27.858 --> 02:03:29.909
They will be happy to tell you.

02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:33.709
So you know where exactly
you can put your comments.

02:03:41.045 --> 02:03:43.406
You should not have let
him do that, Fania.

02:03:43.407 --> 02:03:46.058
I answered but nobody
heard what I said.

02:03:48.059 --> 02:03:49.571
But he is right,

02:03:49.572 --> 02:03:52.024
And I also think it's a serious thing.

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:55.533
I'm not on your side.

02:03:55.534 --> 02:03:58.532
I'm just trying to
survive for Jerusalem.

02:03:59.633 --> 02:04:00.470
All right.

02:04:02.972 --> 02:04:05.505
What do you mean, Fania?

02:04:05.906 --> 02:04:07.735
I mean, this is fine.

02:04:07.736 --> 02:04:12.891
If you can get away from
what war is, so clean.

02:04:12.892 --> 02:04:15.899
But we are not
responsible for this.

02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:19.035
No, of course not.
Nothing here is our fault.

02:04:23.637 --> 02:04:26.858
What I mean is this,
maybe we are innocent,

02:04:28.659 --> 02:04:30.167
But we have changed.

02:04:31.469 --> 02:04:34.659
I want to say that we know something
more about the human race,

02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:36.541
Which we did not know before.

02:04:37.442 --> 02:04:39.478
And not good news.

02:04:39.479 --> 02:04:42.645
How can you still call them humans?

02:04:43.946 --> 02:04:45.983
And what are they?

02:04:50.184 --> 02:04:53.723
I do not like the way you
connect such monsters with us.

02:04:55.024 --> 02:04:55.889
Mengele.

02:05:24.606 --> 02:05:28.106
Would Herr doctor like to
hear any particular music?

02:06:23.524 --> 02:06:24.424
"Kapo"

02:06:31.126 --> 02:06:32.058
Doctor.

02:06:33.959 --> 02:06:39.912
These are the bracelet and the
posthumous flag of its director.

02:06:40.313 --> 02:06:42.821
They must remain undisturbed.

02:06:46.123 --> 02:06:47.205
In memoriam.

02:07:10.450 --> 02:07:12.706
If the Herr Doctor allows me to.

02:07:15.652 --> 02:07:17.694
The orchestra is determined to

02:07:17.695 --> 02:07:20.928
Interpret with our greater capacity

02:07:21.038 --> 02:07:24.105
In the memory of our
beloved director.

02:07:26.406 --> 02:07:29.914
I can assure you, Dr.
We are ready

02:07:29.915 --> 02:07:32.623
To devote all the necessary time

02:07:32.624 --> 02:07:34.422
To perfect the way we play.

02:07:34.423 --> 02:07:38.954
We believe that our late leader
would have wanted us to continue.

02:07:38.955 --> 02:07:43.162
Let us move forward,

02:07:43.163 --> 02:07:45.949
She has inspired us.

02:08:38.268 --> 02:08:41.268
... rehearse and rehearse and rehearse,

02:08:41.269 --> 02:08:46.549
We must not touch until
we can do it right.

02:08:53.251 --> 02:08:56.422
Yes, we should not
do that again...

02:08:56.423 --> 02:08:58.352
You should not have...

02:08:59.658 --> 02:09:01.684
I had never been... Fania...

02:09:06.859 --> 02:09:08.252
Oh, Mandel.

02:09:30.931 --> 02:09:33.512
You can play Mme Butterfly,

02:09:35.914 --> 02:09:39.408
You and the others.

02:10:24.744 --> 02:10:27.745
We are ready to begin,
Frau Lagerfuhrerin

02:10:30.646 --> 02:10:32.686
We are ready to begin.

02:10:36.688 --> 02:10:39.772
Is it something that
happened to the boy?

02:10:51.871 --> 02:10:55.821
It has always been said that
the greatness of the people,

02:10:55.822 --> 02:10:58.720
Depends on the sacrifices
they are willing to make.

02:11:01.921 --> 02:11:04.016
I gave him back.

02:11:13.343 --> 02:11:14.095
Let's go now,

02:11:15.344 --> 02:11:16.907
Touch for me.

02:11:22.209 --> 02:11:23.629
Play for me.

02:14:28.572 --> 02:14:31.572
Musicians, we'll start the rehearsal.

02:14:34.174 --> 02:14:36.187
I order you to rehearse.

02:14:37.188 --> 02:14:38.896
It is the Russian artillery,

02:14:38.897 --> 02:14:42.369
I am in charge, and I have not given
permission to suspend trials.

02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:45.443
Stupid, it's all over.
You do not get it!

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.957
It's the Russians
out there, Olga.

02:14:47.958 --> 02:14:51.859
And we probably "gas"
Before they can get here.

02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:54.656
Relax, we can not
rehearse in the dark.

02:14:54.657 --> 02:14:56.825
She can in any case
carry the baton.

02:14:56.826 --> 02:14:58.374
Stop grilling potatoes,

02:14:58.375 --> 02:14:59.836
What are you thinking?

02:14:59.837 --> 02:15:01.367
I order you to come with me.

02:15:02.569 --> 02:15:03.511
Stop.

02:15:04.112 --> 02:15:04.995
Sit down.

02:15:04.996 --> 02:15:06.518
The Germans leave tonight.

02:15:06.519 --> 02:15:07.649
I do not see why.

02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:11.411
We'll be released, silly.
We survived.

02:15:12.612 --> 02:15:16.138
He's trying to get an
orchestra to direct,

02:15:16.139 --> 02:15:17.371
But the war must end.

02:16:00.656 --> 02:16:02.657
I was supposed to be free, or something.

02:16:30.757 --> 02:16:31.558
I believe that...

02:16:32.659 --> 02:16:33.684
I should applaud...

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:36.205
he...

02:16:41.507 --> 02:16:42.968
I believe that...

02:16:44.269 --> 02:16:45.775
Have you seen him?

02:16:51.076 --> 02:16:51.915
Do not.

02:17:24.916 --> 02:17:26.906
I want you to have this,

02:17:27.207 --> 02:17:28.627
It's my diary.

02:17:30.327 --> 02:17:34.691
I can not do this.
I know you'll live, Fania, I know.

02:17:34.692 --> 02:17:36.457
I assure you that I want to live,

02:17:36.458 --> 02:17:38.653
I feel something
terrible is happening.

02:18:52.213 --> 02:18:53.714
Where are we going?

02:18:54.815 --> 02:18:56.339
Where are they taking us?

02:19:17.454 --> 02:19:18.353
Sonya!

02:19:19.455 --> 02:19:21.459
Fania, I can not go on.

02:19:27.361 --> 02:19:29.385
How is every soldier doing?

02:19:31.587 --> 02:19:34.320
Can you tell me
where they lead us?

02:19:36.465 --> 02:19:38.513
Because wherever it is

02:19:38.514 --> 02:19:41.556
It's like making a guy
forget his problems.

02:19:42.885 --> 02:19:44.933
Where do we go?

02:19:44.934 --> 02:19:46.686
Who knows?
- Truly?

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:49.983
I think it's so they do not fall
into the hands of the Russians.

02:19:49.984 --> 02:19:53.103
They would tell them what they did to them.

02:19:56.004 --> 02:19:57.497
Are they going to kill us?

02:19:57.498 --> 02:19:58.775
Do not ask me.

02:20:03.877 --> 02:20:06.409
I make you "Kappo", keep them together,

02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:08.056
Follow that path and take care of the bombs,

02:20:08.057 --> 02:20:09.904
The commanders will
be in charge later.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Fania!

02:20:23.001 --> 02:20:23.743
Where are you?

02:21:27.752 --> 02:21:28.572
Fania...

02:21:30.573 --> 02:21:34.663
Try to keep your eyes

02:21:35.764 --> 02:21:38.724
Open if you can.

02:23:11.177 --> 02:23:12.759
You have to live Fania.

02:25:13.225 --> 02:25:17.225
Could it be possible for you
to say something to the press?

02:25:20.327 --> 02:25:22.411
It is very important to me.

02:26:06.726 --> 02:26:08.726
<i>Let us march, children of the country,</i>

02:26:14.376 --> 02:26:16.376
<i>That the day of glory has arrived</i>

02:26:19.378 --> 02:26:22.439
We have faced tyranny,

02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.573
Our bloody flag

02:26:26.574 --> 02:26:28.100
Es ized.

02:26:33.202 --> 02:26:36.781
Do you understand me comrades?

02:26:40.583 --> 02:26:44.471
When you reach men be soldiers

02:26:45.682 --> 02:26:48.188
They will fall into our arms,

02:26:49.589 --> 02:26:54.069
To kill, to kill completely!

02:26:55.571 --> 02:26:58.034
To arms, comrades!

02:26:58.035 --> 02:27:00.373
Form brigades!

02:27:03.075 --> 02:27:06.263
On the go, on the go,

02:27:08.139 --> 02:27:10.208
Do not be afraid.

02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:15.936
For a much higher ideal.
