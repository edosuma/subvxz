WEBVTT

00:00.173 --> 00:03.606
- Previously on Good Witch...
- Wish we could switch parents.

00:03.667 --> 00:05.634
Your mom would understand
why I want to go to London.

00:05.669 --> 00:08.069
Hillcrest Hospital might offer
me their Chief of Staff job.

00:08.105 --> 00:10.522
I'm totally committed to us having kids,

00:10.557 --> 00:12.240
there's just a lot
of change coming our way.

00:12.276 --> 00:14.242
I'm glad we reconnected.

00:24.354 --> 00:26.321
Ah, this place is amazing.

00:26.356 --> 00:28.256
Yeah, for such a small town.

00:28.292 --> 00:30.425
Middleton offers a lot
of unexpected things.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.761
True.

00:32.796 --> 00:35.063
- Feels good to stretch my legs.
- Yeah, but we've been

00:35.132 --> 00:38.099
poring over resumes
for an hour. I did not think

00:38.135 --> 00:40.335
it would be this hard
to find a field supervisor.

00:40.370 --> 00:42.771
The perfect person is out
there. I have a feeling.

00:42.806 --> 00:45.740
With your help, I'm sure I'll find them.

00:47.678 --> 00:49.744
Nice work.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.480
So tell me, how can I pay
you back for all this work?

00:52.516 --> 00:55.717
- Buying me dinner is enough.
- You're letting me off cheap.

00:55.752 --> 00:58.553
Come on, I wanna do something
really special for you.

00:58.588 --> 01:01.189
To be honest, this is
as much fun as it is work.

01:01.224 --> 01:04.426
That's how I see it.
I wish my students would have

01:04.461 --> 01:07.529
a quarter of your enthusiasm,
and focus, and patience.

01:07.564 --> 01:09.597
It seems like no one wants
to wait for anything anymore.

01:09.633 --> 01:12.367
And archeology is about
delayed gratification.

01:12.402 --> 01:14.836
- Yeah, trusting your instincts.
- Continuing ahead

01:14.871 --> 01:16.647
even when all the
evidence is against you.

01:16.682 --> 01:18.818
- Faith.
- In the face of doubt.

01:20.063 --> 01:22.711
- You have that.
- So do you.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.647
We both have a willingness
to wait for something good.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.315
Even if you can't
see it, you can feel it.

01:28.950 --> 01:31.386
Like minds.

02:03.486 --> 02:05.419
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:05.488 --> 02:08.354
- Did you get today's paper?
- I did. It's on the counter.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.157
Ugh, I swear, that paper boy hates me.

02:11.226 --> 02:13.207
I just wanted to look at the forecast.

02:13.276 --> 02:16.762
- Isn't it on your phone?
- I don't like what my phone says.

02:16.831 --> 02:19.465
My friend Doug is coming to town
next Saturday and he thinks

02:19.534 --> 02:21.801
- we can play golf.
- Oh. It's freezing!

02:21.870 --> 02:23.936
As long as there's not snow
on the course, he'll play.

02:24.005 --> 02:25.933
- Really?
- Yeah, he's pretty hardcore

02:26.002 --> 02:28.441
when it comes to sports.
But it doesn't look good.

02:28.476 --> 02:30.309
But forecasters are usually
wrong, aren't they?

02:30.378 --> 02:33.179
The weather can change
instantaneously. It's mercurial.

02:33.248 --> 02:35.114
Which means they are wrong
more than they're right.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.517
- That's one way to look at it.
- It's the truth.

02:37.585 --> 02:40.419
Your truth.

02:40.488 --> 02:43.856
Sorry. Ugh, Hillcrest Hospital.

02:43.925 --> 02:46.325
- The Chief of Staff job.
- Yeah, they want to send

02:46.394 --> 02:48.995
a representative to talk to me.
You know, it's a great

02:49.063 --> 02:52.365
opportunity that a few years ago
I probably would have jumped at.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.468
- But things have changed.
- Yeah, well,

02:55.503 --> 02:58.137
Like the weather. I've changed.

02:58.206 --> 03:00.806
Between my practice and Nick,
I'm already short on time.

03:00.875 --> 03:03.943
I told them I'm not interested,
but they're not giving up.

03:04.012 --> 03:05.912
They know a good thing when they see it.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.880
I know I can't do a job like that

03:07.916 --> 03:10.383
unless I give my life
over to it, completely.

03:10.451 --> 03:13.653
- Balance is important.
- Nick's important.

03:14.199 --> 03:16.656
Oh... I'm sorry.

03:16.691 --> 03:18.077
No, I got it.

03:24.299 --> 03:26.933
- Oh! That's pretty.
- Yeah, it is.

03:27.785 --> 03:28.868
When I was little,

03:28.903 --> 03:31.537
before I lost my parents,
we used to spend our summers

03:31.606 --> 03:34.173
at a cottage on the lake.
Some of the best

03:34.209 --> 03:35.906
family memories I have.

03:36.878 --> 03:38.409
Hmm!

03:43.651 --> 03:46.402
My friend told me Middleton
is a sleepy town.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.231
Peaceful, yes, but vibrant too.

03:49.266 --> 03:51.059
Depends on what you're looking for.

03:51.704 --> 03:55.303
- Peaceful.
- Cassie Nightingale. Welcome.

03:55.807 --> 03:57.472
Can I take your bag up to your room?

03:57.508 --> 03:59.374
No! I'm good.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.710
Once you get settled in,

04:01.745 --> 04:04.145
I can go over all the activities
that are going on in Middleton

04:04.181 --> 04:06.143
- this week.
- Something tells me

04:06.168 --> 04:08.550
- you are not here for the sights.
- Just looking

04:08.585 --> 04:11.920
for some rest. I had a minor
procedure recently.

04:11.955 --> 04:14.037
Nothing too serious,

04:14.072 --> 04:16.725
I just thought I'd take some
time before going back to work.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.027
I tried staying at home,
but I kept getting called in.

04:19.062 --> 04:20.795
There's no rest in the tech field.

04:20.863 --> 04:23.025
Something is always crashing
or not working.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.667
Your room is down the hall,
last door on the left.

04:25.702 --> 04:27.738
- I'll show you.
- Nope, I've got it.

04:27.773 --> 04:28.722
Thanks.

04:30.207 --> 04:33.708
Well, I wish all our guests
were like that.

04:33.744 --> 04:37.538
- Quiet?
- Easy.

04:37.607 --> 04:40.415
Yes... easy.

04:49.593 --> 04:52.081
- This is nice.
- Yeah!

04:52.676 --> 04:56.264
Although, I feel the store isn't
holding as much appeal as your phone.

04:58.635 --> 05:00.502
Guilty! Sorry.

05:02.673 --> 05:04.397
There's drama at school.

05:04.831 --> 05:07.621
Brenda just sent out invites
to her sweet 16 party

05:07.656 --> 05:10.745
and everyone is talking about
who is and isn't invited.

05:10.814 --> 05:13.448
- Hmm...
- I was.

05:13.517 --> 05:15.650
- That sounds fun.
- Yeah!

05:16.371 --> 05:18.155
No.

05:18.224 --> 05:20.762
Those big parties kind of
make me uncomfortable.

05:20.831 --> 05:23.625
Oh, well, how about something smaller?
Movie night at Grey House?

05:23.694 --> 05:25.134
You could invite a few girlfriends.

05:25.159 --> 05:28.716
Yeah, or we could
just hang out. Maybe we could

05:28.741 --> 05:30.421
make a batch
of the snickerdoodle cookies.

05:30.446 --> 05:32.191
Sure, if that's what you want.

05:32.235 --> 05:36.404
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.440
Cassie!

05:38.508 --> 05:40.842
- Tom!
- And Grace.

05:40.877 --> 05:43.845
- Hi, Mr. Tinsdale.
- You are growing up so fast.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.785
You'll be off to college
before you know it!

05:47.634 --> 05:51.686
Tom, I have something for you. Hmm...

05:51.722 --> 05:54.589
For your sinuses.

05:55.072 --> 05:56.591
How did you...

05:56.627 --> 06:00.662
Oh! Thanks. How much do I owe you?

06:00.731 --> 06:02.764
- Ten dollars.
- Here.

06:02.799 --> 06:06.101
Thanks. Don't forget your receipt.

06:13.010 --> 06:15.010
- Is there anything else?
- Ugh...

06:15.045 --> 06:17.612
I do need a present for Martha.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.782
- Your 30th anniversary.
- Yes.

06:20.817 --> 06:22.715
Oh! Do you have something
special planned?

06:22.740 --> 06:25.053
- Should I?
- Well, it'd be nice for the both of you.

06:25.088 --> 06:27.090
It's more about Martha.

06:27.115 --> 06:29.239
She is very big on our anniversary.

06:29.275 --> 06:32.894
Hmm! Maybe you were thinking
about something festive?

06:32.963 --> 06:35.196
Festive... You mean like a party?

06:35.232 --> 06:36.792
Oh! It's a great idea.

06:38.783 --> 06:41.136
I had a party for Martha
when we were first married.

06:41.171 --> 06:44.205
She worried so much about everything,
she couldn't enjoy it.

06:44.274 --> 06:46.166
Well, what she doesn't know...

06:47.526 --> 06:48.977
A surprise?

06:49.012 --> 06:50.509
That's another great idea!

06:51.070 --> 06:53.515
But I can't keep a secret
that big from Martha.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.251
Hmm...

06:56.834 --> 06:58.486
No.

06:58.969 --> 07:01.156
No, I can't ask you to do it.

07:01.191 --> 07:03.369
Consider it a gift to both of you.

07:04.127 --> 07:06.553
Cassie Nightingale, you are an angel.

07:06.836 --> 07:07.925
Thank you.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.405
I can't find the spoons.

07:18.518 --> 07:20.208
Ice cream for lunch?

07:20.564 --> 07:22.677
It's a healthy snack full of

07:22.713 --> 07:25.747
calcium and... I just want a spoon.

07:25.782 --> 07:27.716
I re-arranged everything.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.618
This is the third time this week.

07:30.654 --> 07:33.922
I'm not even going to mention
what you did to my sock drawer.

07:33.990 --> 07:36.253
- Look, I can tell you're bored.
- I am.

07:36.637 --> 07:38.485
Maybe you should think about
going back to school sooner.

07:38.995 --> 07:40.679
I'll think about that,

07:40.714 --> 07:43.898
- but in the meantime...
- You should find something to do.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.421
- Like a hobby?
- Yeah.

07:47.604 --> 07:49.603
I saw this today.

07:50.507 --> 07:54.092
- Community art classes.
- For adults. Beginners.

07:54.161 --> 07:57.045
Great! I think you should
do it! It'll be good for you.

07:57.114 --> 07:59.414
And for the kitchen. And for me.

07:59.483 --> 08:01.850
And for my socks.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.595
You want me to cater
an anniversary party

08:09.631 --> 08:12.293
- for Martha?
- It wouldn't work without you.

08:12.362 --> 08:15.038
How many people? Pass
hors d'oeuvres or multiple courses?

08:15.063 --> 08:16.664
You know what, I'll just work up

08:16.700 --> 08:19.700
a tasting menu and Martha can decide.
I'll just give her a call.

08:19.769 --> 08:21.741
No, ugh... Tom wants it
to be a surprise.

08:21.809 --> 08:23.616
Oh! No problem.

08:24.552 --> 08:27.709
- Are you sure about that?
- I can keep a secret.

08:29.412 --> 08:32.347
- I can!
- Hey, Ben.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.414
Hey! I fixed the brackets
for your shelf.

08:34.484 --> 08:36.384
- Oh!
- This is a nice surprise.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.722
- So, what's up?
- Oh, nothing.

08:40.552 --> 08:42.590
Cassie is planning a surprise
anniversary party for Martha

08:42.659 --> 08:45.160
- and I'm going to cater it.
- Oh.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.662
What? It's not a surprise from Ben.

08:47.731 --> 08:48.918
Mmm-hmm.

08:50.813 --> 08:52.917
The deadline for
the application is coming up.

08:53.544 --> 08:56.004
I'm still checking out the program.

08:56.137 --> 08:59.607
Greg said a semester abroad in London
would be a great life experience.

08:59.643 --> 09:01.656
Nick, it's not a 2 week vacation.

09:01.681 --> 09:04.132
It's 4 months in a foreign country.

09:05.081 --> 09:06.669
They all speak English.

09:07.831 --> 09:09.951
You're doing well in school.

09:09.986 --> 09:12.020
Right! I've totally earned this.

09:12.088 --> 09:14.489
- What if you fall behind?
- I won't.

09:14.558 --> 09:17.625
Greg said that this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

09:17.661 --> 09:20.328
While I respect Greg's opinion,

09:20.363 --> 09:22.964
your life has just begun. You're
gonna have lots of chances

09:22.989 --> 09:25.092
to do things like this.
Most colleges have

09:25.128 --> 09:27.330
study abroad programs
for juniors and seniors.

09:27.355 --> 09:29.237
Why won't you let me go?

09:29.272 --> 09:32.073
I need you to explain
to me why you want to go.

09:32.108 --> 09:35.243
- I have.
- Not really. Not in any detail.

09:36.023 --> 09:38.112
Maybe I could read your essay.

09:39.443 --> 09:42.540
The study abroad requires that
you write a 1,000 word essay

09:42.575 --> 09:45.086
on why you want to take part
in the London program.

09:46.317 --> 09:47.188
I think reading that

09:47.224 --> 09:49.757
might help me make my decision.

10:02.806 --> 10:06.107
- I love your new hair.
- Thank you! I needed a change.

10:06.142 --> 10:09.644
But you don't really want
to talk about my hair, do you?

10:10.981 --> 10:12.496
Martha's party.

10:13.116 --> 10:16.017
Stephanie. When it comes
to gossip, that woman has

10:16.052 --> 10:19.287
more leaks than the Titanic. If you
really want to keep it a surprise,

10:19.322 --> 10:21.728
- cut her loose now.
- So, what do you say?

10:22.935 --> 10:25.126
Martha is so high-maintenance.

10:25.161 --> 10:28.296
Yeah, but this is a surprise party, so
Martha won't be involved in the planning.

10:28.331 --> 10:30.036
I'm really busy at the store.

10:32.157 --> 10:34.442
You really need my help, don't you?

10:34.838 --> 10:37.580
If you help Martha, you'll
actually be helping yourself.

10:38.174 --> 10:40.111
I don't fall for reverse psychology.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.775
I know. It's your choice.

10:44.104 --> 10:45.480
Okay, fine.

10:45.515 --> 10:47.199
You won't regret it.

10:48.063 --> 10:50.685
Look, it's Alexis' brother...

10:50.754 --> 10:52.368
- Greg?
- Mmm-hmm!

10:53.690 --> 10:56.090
- You haven't met him yet, have you?
- No!

10:56.159 --> 10:58.760
Perfect. Greg!

11:03.466 --> 11:06.434
Hi! I don't believe
you've met my cousin,

11:06.469 --> 11:07.051
Cassie Nightingale.

11:07.076 --> 11:10.659
Ah! It's nice to finally meet you.
Alexis is a big fan.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.418
Thank you. Send her my love.

11:14.878 --> 11:16.747
Alright. I better get back to work.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.462
Don't be a stranger!

11:21.811 --> 11:23.677
- Okay, that is a first.
- What?

11:23.746 --> 11:26.480
I've never had a man play
hard to get before.

11:26.549 --> 11:28.582
- How do you deal with it?
- Ah!

11:28.618 --> 11:30.197
- Abigail...
- I'm just asking.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.242
He was just in a hurry!

11:31.287 --> 11:34.755
Looks like you might just
actually have to work for this one.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.525
That'll be a change.

11:38.649 --> 11:40.728
Something different.

11:40.796 --> 11:42.410
Could be fun!

11:42.435 --> 11:44.255
Maybe just what you're looking for.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.333
Or who I'm looking for.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.899
- Aren't you cold?
- It helps me think.

12:03.967 --> 12:06.655
- About?
- Everything.

12:06.724 --> 12:09.557
You care to elaborate?

12:10.031 --> 12:12.927
You know, when we were
horseback riding, it reminded me

12:12.995 --> 12:14.501
how much I love the outdoors.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.354
You did seem at home in that saddle.

12:18.134 --> 12:21.902
Living in New York and working so much,
I didn't get to do things like that.

12:21.938 --> 12:23.771
And I didn't really miss it
until I got out there again.

12:24.420 --> 12:28.542
Our connection to nature is
very primal. It's in our DNA.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.912
Oddly, that makes sense.

12:31.948 --> 12:35.082
- You know, the lake house?
- Yeah.

12:35.151 --> 12:36.438
The ad we saw in the paper.

12:37.186 --> 12:40.888
Maybe if I got a place like that, it'd be
a way for Nick and me to get outside,

12:40.923 --> 12:44.291
you know. Do things together. Here.
Like I did when I was his age.

12:44.327 --> 12:48.996
- Sounds like you had an epiphany.
- Yeah. I might have.

12:49.031 --> 12:51.332
You know... You know a lot
about the area.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.267
- Yeah.
- Could you go with me?

12:53.302 --> 12:55.402
- Sure.
- Great! I'll set something up

12:55.438 --> 12:56.265
for Sunday morning.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.671
- I'll call the agent and get a key.
- Great!

12:57.707 --> 13:00.341
- Yeah! It could be.
- Oh! I do have to be back

13:00.376 --> 13:02.963
early, though. I've got a lot
of party planning to do.

13:02.998 --> 13:06.280
Ah! Martha's surprise anniversary party?

13:06.315 --> 13:09.283
Yeah, I hadn't told you about that yet.

13:09.318 --> 13:11.785
Oh, the guy at the food market.

13:11.821 --> 13:13.787
He told Eve. And Stephanie told him.

13:13.823 --> 13:16.023
So, are you coming?

13:16.058 --> 13:17.958
- Are you hosting?
- I am.

13:17.994 --> 13:19.960
- At Grey House?
- No!

13:19.996 --> 13:22.062
- Where then?
- I don't know yet.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.197
Well, at least that part's
still a surprise.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.368
- Mmm-hmm!
- See you!

13:35.902 --> 13:38.736
I am totally stressing
about the menu for...

13:38.771 --> 13:41.405
...Martha's party.

13:41.441 --> 13:44.442
- What?
- Abigail's doing the flowers.

13:44.510 --> 13:47.078
- Was I not supposed to tell Abigail?
- It's supposed to be a secret.

13:47.113 --> 13:50.581
- Yeah, from Martha.
- No. You're not supposed to tell anyone.

13:50.650 --> 13:53.017
Ben probably would have told her anyway.

13:54.687 --> 13:57.455
- Oh!
- You look like a woman

13:57.523 --> 13:59.757
- on a mission.
- I need answers.

13:59.826 --> 14:02.393
- My anniversary is coming up.
- Oh.

14:02.428 --> 14:04.662
Oh. You have an anniversary?

14:04.731 --> 14:07.232
Yes. All married people do.

14:07.301 --> 14:08.833
Have you seen Tom lately?

14:08.901 --> 14:11.202
It is a small town,

14:11.237 --> 14:14.760
and in a small town you are bound to run
into people you know all the time.

14:17.094 --> 14:20.044
So, Tom hasn't mentioned
our anniversary...

14:20.113 --> 14:22.213
that means either A, he's forgotten,

14:22.281 --> 14:25.726
or B, he's planning something
behind my back.

14:26.018 --> 14:28.219
- You could just ask him.
- In our marriage,

14:28.287 --> 14:31.989
the duty of marking our anniversary
has always been his responsibility.

14:32.058 --> 14:33.791
But it's both your anniversaries.

14:33.826 --> 14:36.827
Yes, but the responsibility
for romance lies with the man.

14:37.227 --> 14:41.166
I think keeping the romance
alive is a shared responsibility.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.334
Well, we'll just have
to agree to disagree.

14:43.873 --> 14:45.871
Just promise me that if either of you

14:45.938 --> 14:48.773
hear anything from Tom,
you'll let me know.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.016
See... I got this.

14:56.577 --> 14:59.284
So, are you going to Brenda's party?

14:59.801 --> 15:01.419
Ugh, I don't think so.

15:01.928 --> 15:03.625
How's London going?

15:03.775 --> 15:06.056
I have to write an essay
about why I want to go.

15:06.092 --> 15:09.393
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It's homework.

15:09.878 --> 15:11.278
Why do you want to go?

15:12.172 --> 15:14.999
I told you, because London is cool

15:15.067 --> 15:17.126
and parent-free.

15:18.086 --> 15:20.070
You know, it rains almost
half the year there.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.673
Yeah, I can deal with rain.

15:22.926 --> 15:25.118
180 days of rain?

15:25.457 --> 15:28.222
You'll be stuck inside a lot
and you won't know anyone.

15:28.264 --> 15:31.228
- But I'll be on my own.
- That's kind of my point.

15:32.715 --> 15:35.020
- Are you jealous that I'm going?
- I'm not.

15:35.054 --> 15:38.122
I just want to make sure you know
what you're getting yourself into.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.459
I do. And I'll be fine.

15:44.130 --> 15:46.430
So wait, you got in trouble

15:46.466 --> 15:48.032
for what at your art class?

15:48.057 --> 15:50.391
For mixing our oils
with the water colours.

15:50.426 --> 15:51.753
"Our" oils?

15:51.778 --> 15:53.938
Donna. She's so much fun.
We share a station.

15:53.973 --> 15:55.940
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah. Her and her husband Chad

15:55.975 --> 15:58.943
- own their own candy business.
- Ugh!

15:58.978 --> 16:03.781
I can't remember if it's saltwater
taffy or peanut brittle

16:03.816 --> 16:05.749
that got them started,
but they have a whole store now.

16:05.785 --> 16:08.252
They are very well off.

16:08.287 --> 16:11.155
I think you'd really like Donna.
And Chad sounds nice.

16:11.734 --> 16:13.090
You haven't met him.

16:13.125 --> 16:16.927
Which is why I wanted to invite both of them
over, to get to know them better.

16:16.963 --> 16:19.730
We need to expand our circle of friends.

16:20.249 --> 16:21.900
Why? We have a very full circle.

16:21.968 --> 16:25.857
We don't. All our friends here
are your friends or your family.

16:26.356 --> 16:28.506
Well, maybe we can meet them for dinner.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.208
I want to have them here.
Entertain in our home.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.779
Or I could go back
to rearranging the kitchen.

16:36.902 --> 16:38.148
Dinner sounds great.

16:42.955 --> 16:43.714
Uh-huh!

16:43.739 --> 16:45.732
The representative
from Hillcrest hospital is here

16:45.767 --> 16:47.191
- to see you.
- What?

16:47.226 --> 16:49.047
The representative from Hillcrest.

16:49.115 --> 16:51.114
I told them I wasn't interested.

16:52.899 --> 16:54.798
Well, what do you want me to tell them?

16:54.834 --> 16:56.867
Just send him back.

17:00.740 --> 17:04.508
- What?
- It's not a "him". It's a "her".

17:04.577 --> 17:06.510
Well, send her back.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.115
Okay!

17:11.498 --> 17:13.349
I'll be out front if you need anything.

17:13.419 --> 17:17.320
Thank you, Eve.

17:17.390 --> 17:19.957
- I'm Valerie Hanson, from Hillcrest.
- Hi. I'm...

17:20.026 --> 17:21.959
Dr. Samuel William Radford.

17:22.028 --> 17:24.627
Near perfect MCAT score, top
five of your graduating class,

17:24.696 --> 17:26.829
chief resident during
your training, lead fellow,

17:26.898 --> 17:30.067
board certified trauma surgeon
and head of one of the busiest

17:30.136 --> 17:32.236
ERs in New York City
for almost a decade.

17:32.603 --> 17:36.474
Hmm! And I told your boss
I'm not interested.

17:36.542 --> 17:39.310
He's better at taking "no"
for an answer than I am,

17:39.378 --> 17:42.880
which is why he does what
he does, and I do what I do.

17:42.949 --> 17:45.583
- What do you do?
- I'm a closer.

17:47.887 --> 17:50.354
Look. I'm flattered, but I'm happy here.

17:50.389 --> 17:52.423
Give me a chance to change your mind.

17:53.399 --> 17:55.059
I can spare 15 minutes.

17:55.623 --> 17:57.161
I only need 5.

17:58.764 --> 18:00.349
Hey, you wanna see a movie tonight?

18:00.384 --> 18:03.000
Sure! So, I was thinking...

18:03.069 --> 18:05.069
That I don't get to pick the movie?

18:05.104 --> 18:09.506
Yeah. I am definitely tired
of superheroes taking more than three hours

18:09.542 --> 18:12.876
to save the world... no matter
how cute they happen to be.

18:12.945 --> 18:15.279
I see subtitles in my future.

18:15.348 --> 18:19.016
What I was thinking is
that I can't ask Martha

18:19.085 --> 18:22.152
what kind of cake she would
like, but you can.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.090
You could casually drop cake
into a conversation.

18:25.126 --> 18:28.192
How do you casually drop cake
into a conversation?

18:28.227 --> 18:30.928
What? Like, Hey Martha, you need
to winterize your pipes.

18:30.963 --> 18:33.397
That makes me wonder
what kind of cake you like.

18:33.432 --> 18:35.933
Okay. Point taken.

18:35.968 --> 18:37.936
Are you sure you want to do this?

18:37.972 --> 18:41.171
- Yes. I love catering big parties.
- Why?

18:41.207 --> 18:44.074
Because you get to be a part
of everyone's best moments.

18:44.658 --> 18:48.146
Weddings, anniversaries,
birthdays, engagements...

18:48.180 --> 18:51.924
All the good and happy things
in people's lives.

18:51.959 --> 18:54.318
That's why I want Martha's party
to be perfect.

18:55.139 --> 18:56.754
You make it sound romantic.

18:56.789 --> 18:59.028
To me it is.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.993
I really think you should reconsider
opening a catering business.

19:03.029 --> 19:05.029
- I lost my investor.
- I remember that.

19:05.064 --> 19:07.097
But he isn't the only person
that can invest.

19:07.735 --> 19:09.133
He's the only person I know.

19:09.590 --> 19:11.803
- I could find you an investor.
- How?

19:12.076 --> 19:14.071
I have a lot of friends
you don't know about.

19:15.062 --> 19:16.608
That's sweet,

19:16.642 --> 19:20.411
but let's just forget about it, okay?

19:33.125 --> 19:35.092
Fancy!

19:35.127 --> 19:37.461
Perfect for Madam Mayor.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.463
Tom wants the location
to be very special.

19:39.532 --> 19:41.901
I don't see why you just
don't have it here.

19:42.334 --> 19:44.601
Tom wants it to be someplace
Martha's never been,

19:44.670 --> 19:46.837
so they can go back
and enjoy the memories.

19:46.906 --> 19:49.807
- Sounds like a lot of work.
- He loves her.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.975
That also sounds like a lot of work.

20:10.663 --> 20:12.596
Dan... what is it?

20:14.667 --> 20:15.757
I...

20:17.647 --> 20:20.374
I was reading.
I must have fallen asleep.

20:21.030 --> 20:23.540
- Are you okay?
- No.

20:24.902 --> 20:26.243
No.

20:26.854 --> 20:28.246
You look like you've seen a ghost.

20:31.205 --> 20:32.916
I think I did.

20:46.393 --> 20:50.579
I was sound asleep
until I heard this bang.

20:50.585 --> 20:53.286
I sat up in bed
and that's when I saw her.

20:53.321 --> 20:54.213
The ghost?

20:54.238 --> 20:56.956
A shadowy figure
in the corner of the room.

20:56.992 --> 21:01.060
- What did she look like?
- She was young, pretty,

21:01.096 --> 21:03.663
but she looked sad.
She didn't say anything,

21:03.732 --> 21:05.832
but she was looking right at me.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.768
I turned on the light and she was gone.

21:08.803 --> 21:12.111
- Is everything alright in here?
- Dan, this is my son, Brandon.

21:12.644 --> 21:16.373
Look, I know what I sound like

21:16.408 --> 21:18.971
and if I were you,
I wouldn't believe me either,

21:19.007 --> 21:21.447
but I did see a ghost.

21:21.516 --> 21:23.982
She was as real
as the three of you. I swear.

21:24.156 --> 21:26.223
- A ghost?
- Have you

21:26.258 --> 21:29.460
ever had any reports
of apparitions in the past?

21:29.528 --> 21:31.395
Last I checked,

21:31.430 --> 21:33.363
Grey House was apparition-free.

21:34.071 --> 21:37.469
Yeah. Because, no offense,
but ghosts aren't real.

21:37.503 --> 21:40.370
When we see something
out of the ordinary

21:40.406 --> 21:42.286
it's a sign we need to pay attention.

21:43.854 --> 21:45.476
Don't worry. We we'll get

21:45.544 --> 21:47.711
to the bottom of this. I promise.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.944
I think we should switch your room.

21:53.252 --> 21:55.786
- Thank you.
- I'll have George bring up a key.

22:04.697 --> 22:07.431
You're not buying
this ghost stuff, are you?

22:07.466 --> 22:09.600
The guy is off his rocker.

22:09.635 --> 22:11.668
I mean, if you said

22:11.704 --> 22:15.372
you saw something, that's
one thing. But you are you.

22:15.407 --> 22:19.216
Just because we can't see something
doesn't mean it isn't there.

22:19.912 --> 22:22.713
Okay. But you should keep
an eye on that guy.

22:22.748 --> 22:24.378
I get a funny feeling.

22:24.414 --> 22:26.416
Done. And agreed.

22:26.452 --> 22:28.719
Now, as much as I'd love
to stand around chatting

22:28.754 --> 22:32.389
about nonexistent ghosts,
Tara sent me here for-

22:32.424 --> 22:36.093
- For my chicken vindaloo?
- She's planning a dinner party.

22:36.128 --> 22:37.540
She's keeping busy.

22:38.564 --> 22:41.064
Looks like you two are
planning something as well.

22:41.133 --> 22:43.500
Yeah! Tom enlisted me to plan

22:43.569 --> 22:45.602
a surprise anniversary party
for Martha. We were thinking

22:45.638 --> 22:47.604
about the restaurant
overlooking the golf course.

22:47.640 --> 22:51.074
- Jack's.
- Impossible. Not the restaurant.

22:51.110 --> 22:54.077
But keeping a secret from Martha?
She'll smell it a mile away.

22:54.146 --> 22:56.547
Well, then we'll just all have
to go the extra mile.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.816
Thanks.

23:08.127 --> 23:10.360
Thank you so much.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.193
Hey!

23:16.342 --> 23:18.702
- What's this?
- Lunch.

23:18.771 --> 23:21.004
Well, thank you!

23:21.073 --> 23:23.373
- Do you want to share?
- Oh! I thought you'd never ask.

23:23.442 --> 23:26.076
There is...

23:26.145 --> 23:27.991
two of everything in here.

23:28.060 --> 23:31.367
What? Is there? That's weird!

23:34.353 --> 23:36.520
Okay. Let's see.

23:39.365 --> 23:40.424
Lahmacun?

23:40.492 --> 23:43.627
- With beetroot.
- And homemade!

23:43.696 --> 23:45.362
There's a vegan restaurant by
the college run by this family

23:45.431 --> 23:47.998
from Turkey. Very authentic.

23:48.067 --> 23:50.033
- Reminds me of...
- Istanbul.

23:50.102 --> 23:51.246
Uh-huh!

23:51.740 --> 23:54.037
So, I thought of you the other day.

23:54.073 --> 23:56.373
- I was rock climbing.
- Oh. Cedar Bluff?

23:56.442 --> 23:59.109
- Rocky Hollow.
- It's beautiful up there.

23:59.178 --> 24:01.111
Yeah. When's the last time you went?

24:01.146 --> 24:03.947
Ages. To be honest,

24:04.016 --> 24:05.883
no one in my immediate circle
likes to hike.

24:05.918 --> 24:08.952
Hiking is meant for patient
souls not needing a quick fix.

24:09.021 --> 24:10.988
I was in Scotland before this.

24:11.023 --> 24:13.323
The Isle of Skye... life changing.

24:13.392 --> 24:17.561
Yeah. There is nothing like standing
alone surrounded by nature.

24:17.596 --> 24:19.630
It helps you understand
your place in the universe.

24:19.665 --> 24:21.098
It helps you understand the world!

24:21.123 --> 24:22.535
Most people like to know

24:22.571 --> 24:25.903
where they're going. But me, I like not
knowing my destination until I get there.

24:25.971 --> 24:28.872
- You used to love that too.
- I still do.

24:28.908 --> 24:30.921
- Then come with me sometime.
- Hiking?

24:30.956 --> 24:34.912
Yeah! I found a place at the park,
near some waterfalls, peaceful, beautiful...

24:34.947 --> 24:37.581
- Alter Falls?
- No.

24:37.616 --> 24:39.850
I know this area pretty well.

24:39.885 --> 24:43.120
Well, I think there are
things around here

24:43.155 --> 24:45.088
that you haven't seen,
even though you think you have.

24:46.233 --> 24:48.859
Maybe Middleton can still
surprise you too.

24:55.968 --> 24:58.268
I still can't believe you got me here.

24:58.304 --> 25:00.370
- Persistence.
- I said no to lunch.

25:00.406 --> 25:03.440
This isn't lunch. I just wanted
you to see your new office.

25:03.475 --> 25:05.776
- Not my office.
- I know you are the right man

25:05.811 --> 25:08.099
for the job. And I always get my man...

25:08.729 --> 25:10.354
professionally speaking.

25:11.150 --> 25:13.164
Well, the job is very intriguing.

25:13.199 --> 25:16.053
- And the office is nice too.
- I'm glad to hear that.

25:16.088 --> 25:17.451
But I have my practice to think of

25:18.190 --> 25:20.624
and being the only doctor in Middleton,
I have to think of the town too.

25:20.659 --> 25:23.260
I can't abandon it, or them.

25:23.295 --> 25:26.630
Understandable. But maybe we can
find a way to work around that.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.799
I also have a son who's going
to college soon.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.001
I have a son too!

25:31.036 --> 25:34.705
But he's 12, not quite ready to
leave the nest. I have to ask,

25:34.740 --> 25:36.873
are the teen years as bad
as they say they are?

25:38.394 --> 25:41.645
There are ups and downs.
But Nick's doing great right now

25:41.714 --> 25:43.981
and I want to spend as much time
with him as possible.

25:44.016 --> 25:47.584
But if your son's going to college
soon, you might want to secure something

25:47.653 --> 25:49.686
that will allow you to ramp up
your career in the future.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.825
The next step would be
to meet some of my colleagues.

25:55.631 --> 25:57.489
Would you like to take the next step?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.263
Hmm...

26:04.145 --> 26:05.792
I have a feeling

26:05.861 --> 26:09.172
that Martha would like
hydrangeas and baby roses.

26:09.241 --> 26:12.009
I saw her wedding photo,
and she had that bouquet.

26:16.548 --> 26:20.117
- What are you up to?
- You do seem preoccupied.

26:20.185 --> 26:22.819
- I'm just sitting here.
- Looking for someone?

26:22.888 --> 26:24.753
No one in particular.

26:25.758 --> 26:28.845
Oh look! There's Greg.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.162
It would be rude to not say hello.

26:32.231 --> 26:34.058
And you are never rude.

26:35.567 --> 26:38.502
- Hey there!
- Hello.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.686
We seem to keep running into each other.

26:40.711 --> 26:42.061
Yeah, we do.

26:42.106 --> 26:44.841
Maybe we should make a plan
to run into each other?

26:45.212 --> 26:46.882
I like that idea.

26:47.586 --> 26:50.147
- How about lunch?
- I love lunch.

26:50.182 --> 26:52.282
- Me too.
- We just met

26:52.351 --> 26:54.818
and we have so much in common already.

26:56.455 --> 26:58.731
I almost feel sorry for him.

26:59.458 --> 27:02.192
I think he's exactly what Abigail needs.

27:02.227 --> 27:04.461
Yeah, how about 12:30?

27:08.300 --> 27:11.968
Hey! Working on your essay?

27:12.037 --> 27:14.704
Ugh... Yeah.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.714
I can't wait to read it.

27:18.110 --> 27:21.211
Hey, I am...

27:21.246 --> 27:23.313
going to look at a lake house tomorrow.

27:23.348 --> 27:25.982
For what?

27:26.051 --> 27:28.192
- For... us!
- You want to buy a lake house?

27:28.227 --> 27:31.088
Yeah, I thought it would be fun to
have a vacation place for the weekends.

27:31.123 --> 27:33.490
- To do what?
- Well, I don't know!

27:33.525 --> 27:35.199
Fish, jet ski,

27:35.234 --> 27:36.485
hang out on a boat.

27:37.596 --> 27:39.596
I guess that'd be kind of cool.

27:41.225 --> 27:43.376
Especially if you get it

27:43.411 --> 27:44.683
before I go to London.

27:53.533 --> 27:56.179
- I brought you some tea.
- My favourite!

27:56.215 --> 27:59.683
- Thanks, mom.
- Sure. There you go.

27:59.718 --> 28:01.885
- So, how are things going?
- Oh great.

28:01.920 --> 28:02.833
- Yeah?
- Yeah, actually

28:02.858 --> 28:06.089
I forgot to tell you. I aced
my lab in Honours Biology.

28:06.125 --> 28:09.059
Great! Nice.
And what about Sam's office?

28:09.094 --> 28:10.961
I love it there.

28:10.996 --> 28:14.464
Eve is so nice and Sam,
he's a really good doctor.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.200
- It's not too much with school?
- No, no!

28:17.236 --> 28:20.770
And don't worry! I am totally on
track to getting straight A's again.

28:20.806 --> 28:23.173
Well, grades are important,

28:23.208 --> 28:26.543
but there are other aspects to school,
like hanging out with friends.

28:26.578 --> 28:27.723
I know.

28:28.257 --> 28:30.814
I just haven't really been up
to doing that lately.

28:31.947 --> 28:33.618
Is there a problem?

28:33.685 --> 28:37.251
- Some of the girls at school?
- No. Really. Everyone is fine.

28:38.436 --> 28:40.824
Well, I can tell that
there is something...

28:42.828 --> 28:44.761
Well, I mean,

28:44.796 --> 28:46.796
Nick might go to London.

28:47.737 --> 28:50.600
And Lori is away on assignment in L.A.

28:50.669 --> 28:53.114
Brandon and Tara are totally
into that baby thing.

28:53.175 --> 28:55.360
Eve said Sam might take the job
at the hospital...

28:55.403 --> 28:58.308
and I mean Abigail...
if it's not her job,

28:58.343 --> 29:00.577
it's another guy, so...

29:02.314 --> 29:04.314
- I'm here.
- No, I know.

29:04.791 --> 29:07.083
But you have Bell, Book and Candle,

29:07.953 --> 29:09.887
and all of the guests...

29:10.489 --> 29:13.657
Do you feel like you and I don't
spend enough time together?

29:14.535 --> 29:16.087
It's just

29:16.828 --> 29:20.130
We aren't all together
like we used to be.

29:21.056 --> 29:23.534
Everyone is kind
of doing their own thing.

29:25.089 --> 29:27.205
We could make cookies.

29:27.272 --> 29:29.231
And watch a movie. Just us.

29:29.824 --> 29:31.169
I'd love to.

29:31.910 --> 29:33.843
But biology calls.

29:33.912 --> 29:36.513
Right. Okay.

29:36.582 --> 29:38.682
- Love you.
- I love you.

29:40.953 --> 29:44.321
And if you change your mind, I'm here.

29:44.356 --> 29:46.968
I know that. Thanks.

30:07.048 --> 30:09.539
So, I met with the hospital
administrator for Hillcrest.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.418
- Oh! How was it?
- She's intense.

30:12.453 --> 30:14.420
And she was in full sell mode.

30:14.455 --> 30:17.156
She came by the office
unannounced, and before I knew it,

30:17.191 --> 30:19.191
I had agreed to meet her
at the hospital the next day.

30:19.260 --> 30:21.093
They know you'd do an amazing job.

30:21.129 --> 30:22.962
It is a great opportunity,
I just don't know how I could

30:22.997 --> 30:26.499
do that job and spend any time with
Nick, let alone keep my practice.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.534
Keeping a balance is a challenge.

30:28.603 --> 30:30.723
Yeah. It is.

30:35.510 --> 30:37.104
Why are you stopping?

30:37.139 --> 30:39.445
That's the third time
I passed those signs.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.447
I just made a huge circle again.

30:41.482 --> 30:42.442
You did?

30:42.467 --> 30:43.616
I don't think these
directions are right.

30:43.651 --> 30:45.908
There's no Forestview Drive.

30:46.921 --> 30:48.888
Eve's use of the Map app is
questionable.

30:48.923 --> 30:50.890
What about your phone?

30:51.890 --> 30:53.459
No signal.

30:53.494 --> 30:56.629
We are off the grid. In a way.

30:56.664 --> 30:59.965
Well, maybe that's
the sign to turn back.

31:00.001 --> 31:02.868
No. You're definitely going
the right way.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.204
Here.

31:05.239 --> 31:06.804
May I see that?

31:11.868 --> 31:14.747
It's about a mile ahead, that way.

31:14.782 --> 31:17.950
So you take a left
and then the first right.

31:17.985 --> 31:21.092
- You got that from this?
- I did!

31:21.622 --> 31:25.191
That's definitely a sign
we should keep going.

31:29.997 --> 31:32.031
Ahem!

31:41.476 --> 31:45.177
Okay, Mr. Quiet. What is up

31:45.213 --> 31:47.313
- with you?
- Nothing.

31:48.223 --> 31:50.850
Have you started your London essay?

31:51.983 --> 31:53.786
If by starting you mean

31:53.821 --> 31:57.123
opening up my laptop, then... yeah.

31:58.112 --> 31:59.191
Well, don't worry.

31:59.527 --> 32:01.494
It's always hard to begin a paper.

32:01.943 --> 32:04.930
I don't see why I need
to write a huge essay anyway.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.933
They probably just want to make
sure that you've done your research

32:08.002 --> 32:10.000
on London and the program.

32:10.471 --> 32:12.571
Did you know that London is
6 hours ahead?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.485
Yes!

32:15.076 --> 32:17.643
It might make it hard to Skype
with people back home.

32:17.712 --> 32:19.945
And it's an 8 hour
school day over there.

32:20.014 --> 32:21.914
Challenging.

32:21.949 --> 32:24.850
Seriously, who does school for 8 hours?

32:24.886 --> 32:26.157
You!

32:26.921 --> 32:28.141
If you go.

32:31.125 --> 32:34.059
You do still want to go, right?

32:35.485 --> 32:36.695
Yeah.

32:37.716 --> 32:41.033
- Absolutely.
- Hmm!

32:58.216 --> 33:00.085
I'm glad we stayed with it.

33:00.154 --> 33:02.855
It is stunning! Wow!

33:02.924 --> 33:05.691
Do you want to start with the boathouse?

33:05.726 --> 33:07.660
I do. Yeah.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.796
- Beautiful part of the lake.
- It's gorgeous.

33:18.706 --> 33:20.739
This isn't the way to the bistro.

33:20.808 --> 33:23.776
No, I wanted to show you something.
I think this would be a great place

33:23.811 --> 33:26.712
- for your catering business.
- Oh!

33:26.781 --> 33:31.016
Ben... I don't have the money
to do it by myself.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.686
I found you an investor.

33:33.721 --> 33:36.322
- You what?
- Surprised?

33:57.004 --> 33:59.671
♪ So bright

34:00.414 --> 34:04.216
♪ Bright, so bright

34:13.809 --> 34:15.312
Nice.

34:16.844 --> 34:18.493
The people are selling it all,

34:18.529 --> 34:21.400
so I get the boat,
the jet skis, everything.

34:23.204 --> 34:26.007
- Nick's going to flip.
- Yeah.

34:30.344 --> 34:32.091
So, this is your first year teaching?

34:32.116 --> 34:34.681
Yeah, I was working
for my family's foundation.

34:35.483 --> 34:38.650
- They believe in giving back.
- Oh! Me too.

34:40.321 --> 34:44.623
I have just been so busy with my
flower shop that I haven't had time

34:44.659 --> 34:47.592
- to do any real volunteer work.
- Your business is booming.

34:47.661 --> 34:51.496
- You just opened. That's so fast.
- I have a way with people.

34:51.954 --> 34:53.998
- How so?
- I was able to persuade

34:54.068 --> 34:56.768
a lot of people that my flower
shop was a good idea,

34:56.837 --> 34:58.904
and then things just fell into place.

34:59.809 --> 35:01.340
- Persuade?
- Yeah.

35:01.409 --> 35:05.945
My investor, my realtor,
the mayor expedited my license.

35:10.702 --> 35:13.284
Well, you certainly had
a way with my sister.

35:13.977 --> 35:17.723
I have a way at swaying people
to get them to do things

35:17.792 --> 35:21.327
- the way that I want.
- I can see that.

35:24.826 --> 35:27.666
I'm just gonna go take care of this.

35:37.478 --> 35:39.578
This looks like the original wood.

35:39.647 --> 35:41.335
They did a lot of renovations,

35:41.404 --> 35:44.483
but they tried to use as much
original material as possible.

35:45.293 --> 35:47.695
Someone really loved this place.

35:48.122 --> 35:50.022
- I really love this place.
- Yeah!

35:50.509 --> 35:53.759
I'll probably have the pipes
checked, though.

35:53.828 --> 35:56.628
Yeah. If they aren't copper,
they might need to be replaced.

35:58.179 --> 36:00.532
Remind me to show you pictures
of Grey House when I first

36:00.568 --> 36:03.369
got to town. Let's just say,
I am fluent in "old home".

36:03.437 --> 36:06.572
- Your seventh language?
- Yes, I guess so.

36:12.279 --> 36:15.314
- So what do you think?
- It might need a little updating.

36:15.349 --> 36:18.784
But most things benefit
from a bit of renewal, right?

36:18.819 --> 36:21.153
I'm not much of a renovator,
I'm more of a

36:21.188 --> 36:23.188
'buy it already done' kind of guy.

36:23.224 --> 36:26.191
- But it's got it all.
- What?

36:26.227 --> 36:28.427
The potential for a beautiful retreat,

36:28.462 --> 36:32.031
and a place for you and Nick
to create memories.

36:32.066 --> 36:35.701
- I'd be willing to help.
- You would?

36:35.736 --> 36:38.437
Yeah! I think my energy
and effort will be well-spent.

36:38.472 --> 36:40.164
And appreciated.

36:40.608 --> 36:43.057
Very much appreciated.

36:57.806 --> 36:59.740
- Dan...
- I'm exhausted.

36:59.775 --> 37:02.275
- I'm so sorry.
- Every time

37:02.311 --> 37:04.478
I doze off, I get this feeling

37:04.546 --> 37:06.680
and then I jolt up
and I see the ghost again.

37:06.715 --> 37:08.815
The same woman from your first room?

37:08.851 --> 37:11.651
I think so. Has this happened before?

37:11.687 --> 37:14.688
- No, never.
- But this is an old house.

37:14.723 --> 37:16.623
- It is.
- And old houses...

37:16.658 --> 37:20.293
Well, did something happen
with a woman who lived here?

37:20.329 --> 37:23.497
I can assure you, Grey House
doesn't have that kind of energy.

37:25.501 --> 37:28.668
- The ghost is back?
- I'm going to check out.

37:28.737 --> 37:31.505
- Maybe that's best.
- No. You're too tired to drive.

37:31.540 --> 37:36.276
Stay another night. Please. I think
this is where you need to be.

37:36.311 --> 37:38.369
Just one more night.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.051
If he starts walking around
at breakfast saying he saw

37:45.087 --> 37:47.621
dead people, he's going
to frighten our guests.

37:47.689 --> 37:49.823
Present and future.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.427
Face it,

37:52.127 --> 37:53.960
that guy needs professional help.

37:55.169 --> 37:56.830
He does.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.070
What are you doing here on Sunday?

38:05.112 --> 38:06.206
Catching up.

38:07.184 --> 38:08.407
How was the lake house?

38:08.444 --> 38:12.112
Nice! Really nice. I'm considering it.

38:12.147 --> 38:15.215
By the way... Valerie called.

38:15.284 --> 38:19.152
- Hmm...
- I heard the hospital really wants you.

38:19.221 --> 38:22.786
- I am very well-informed.
- I don't doubt it.

38:23.586 --> 38:25.759
Are you also considering

38:25.828 --> 38:28.061
- taking the job?
- I told her no,

38:28.130 --> 38:30.864
but it looks like they're still
considering me, doesn't it?

38:40.696 --> 38:42.008
Well, you look nice.

38:42.077 --> 38:44.911
- Thank you.
- Is that our wedding china?

38:44.980 --> 38:46.035
Yeah.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.738
Don't you think
that it's maybe a bit much?

38:47.783 --> 38:50.183
I just want the Bryants
to feel comfortable.

38:50.252 --> 38:51.952
Do they need china to feel comfortable?

38:52.384 --> 38:54.588
Why did we register for them
if we weren't

38:54.656 --> 38:56.923
- going to use them?
- I'm a guy... I don't know.

38:56.992 --> 39:00.227
And... are you wearing that?

39:03.903 --> 39:06.760
- We're using our good china.
- Yeah.

39:06.829 --> 39:09.603
I just think that
shirt is a little casual.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.272
So, because of the dishes,
I have to change my shirt?

39:13.178 --> 39:14.741
Only if you want to.

39:15.836 --> 39:18.144
I'll go change.

39:22.518 --> 39:24.129
They're here!

39:25.854 --> 39:27.559
I'll get it.

39:29.791 --> 39:33.126
- Tara!
- Welcome...

39:33.195 --> 39:36.496
- both of you!
- Hi. You must be Chad.

39:36.532 --> 39:38.465
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- And Donna.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.734
- Hello.
- Brandon. Hi.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.336
Oh wow! These are too pretty to eat.

39:43.372 --> 39:47.745
You're going to love the chocolate
laced lollypops. Do I smell baked Brie?

39:47.780 --> 39:48.579
Yeah.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.913
So... You're in the candy business.

39:52.948 --> 39:55.815
Yes. Are you a grad student like Tara?

39:55.851 --> 39:58.243
- I'm a cop.
- Cool!

40:00.015 --> 40:01.063
You want a drink?

40:01.088 --> 40:03.213
- Absolutely.
- All right.

40:06.762 --> 40:10.163
Yoo-hoo! I just need
some flowers for my office.

40:10.198 --> 40:11.455
Okay.

40:12.167 --> 40:15.368
So... Have you had any big orders

40:15.404 --> 40:18.338
- from my husband lately?
- No...

40:18.373 --> 40:20.874
Oh. Oh!

40:20.943 --> 40:22.809
I love this.

40:22.844 --> 40:25.712
You can't have that one.
It's for Cassie's par...

40:25.747 --> 40:28.214
Par?

40:28.250 --> 40:31.785
As in party? As in Cassie's
having a party?

40:31.820 --> 40:35.288
A party I don't know about?

40:39.923 --> 40:40.694
John?

40:42.113 --> 40:43.430
George let me in.

40:43.465 --> 40:45.865
Are you ready for our hike?

40:46.599 --> 40:48.535
We didn't make plans.

40:48.975 --> 40:50.503
When did we ever need plans?

40:50.539 --> 40:53.006
- It's late.
- Which is why we should

40:53.041 --> 40:55.375
- leave now so we don't miss the sunset.
- John...

40:56.216 --> 40:57.911
Are you free now?

40:57.946 --> 40:59.946
- Yes.
- Well, then be free.

41:00.015 --> 41:02.882
Come with me. What's the worst
that could happen?

41:02.918 --> 41:05.318
We end up hiking in the dark.

41:06.326 --> 41:07.821
I'm not afraid of the dark, are you?

41:07.889 --> 41:10.190
I always had trouble saying no to you.

41:10.641 --> 41:12.592
So don't.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.228
All right, let's go.

41:15.731 --> 41:18.272
Now that's the Cassie
Nightingale I know.
