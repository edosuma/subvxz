00:02.670 --> 00:05.371
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

Bob's Burgers<i> and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,

of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:33.799
Mom, can I get the...
No!

But it's only...
No!

00:57.491 --> 00:58.590
Aah!

00:58.592 --> 01:00.759
ALL:
Ooh...

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
MAN:
Yo, your car is ready!

01:41.802 --> 01:44.570
1986 Plymouth Junkerola.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.038
Pink Plymouth! Yo!

01:46.040 --> 01:47.773
Whoa! Baby is still
in the back seat.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.108
Mine!

01:52.379 --> 01:53.378
(humming)

01:56.250 --> 01:58.117
(gasps) Oh.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.486
(laughs)

02:00.488 --> 02:03.455
Comedy can be so surprising.

02:03.457 --> 02:07.059
<i>The Japanese Warrior Monks'</i>
<i>Guide to Tidying Up?</i>

02:07.061 --> 02:08.560
Ooh, a bestseller!

02:08.562 --> 02:10.329
And no one goes to Heaven.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.564
Marge, you don't buy books
at a car wash.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.333
Ooh, sushi!

02:17.404 --> 02:19.905
Okay, I read this whole
book while your father

02:19.907 --> 02:22.107
was hospitalized
for food poisoning,

02:22.109 --> 02:24.109
and it changed my life.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.079
I want this house to reach
what the monks call

02:27.081 --> 02:29.615
the "state of en-tidy-ment."

02:29.617 --> 02:31.650
En-tidy-ment? I thought
this family meeting

02:31.652 --> 02:33.685
was about reducing
the carbon footprint

02:33.687 --> 02:35.954
of my college fund.
Done and done.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.956
Wait, wait.
Why is it so easy?

02:37.958 --> 02:40.292
Moving on.
Oh, man!

02:40.294 --> 02:42.961
I thought your mother was
gonna tell us that Grampa died.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.130
Well, the meeting
ain't over yet.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.965
The monks' philosophy is simple.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.969
Take every item you own and ask:
does it still bring me joy?

02:50.971 --> 02:53.138
If yes, then you keep it.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.873
If not, you thank it
for its service

02:54.875 --> 02:56.475
and throw it away.
HOMER: Boring!

02:56.477 --> 02:58.710
Does this beverage coaster
give me joy?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.979
Not anymore.
(grunts)

03:00.981 --> 03:03.982
Not my "Oh, crap, I'm 50"
coaster!

03:03.984 --> 03:06.985
You're not 50, and I don't
like the word "crap."

03:06.987 --> 03:09.054
And I worry you drink
too much beer.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.856
But the rest
of it's good, right?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.457
That's all there is to it.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.660
Marge, before you go cuckoo
with cleanliness

03:14.662 --> 03:17.863
and throw everything out,
think of the kids.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.531
The kids working
in overseas factories

03:19.533 --> 03:21.533
to make this crap.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.235
It's time
for it to go.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.537
Coaster, thank you
for your service.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.306
Nyeh!
No one ever
thanked me

03:27.308 --> 03:28.874
when<i> I</i> was in
the service.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.876
All I got was a
pack of cigarettes

03:30.878 --> 03:32.811
and a college
education!

03:32.813 --> 03:34.413
Speaking
of college education...

03:34.415 --> 03:36.582
Meeting adjourned!
Oh, man.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.649
BART:
<i>Let's see.</i>

03:37.651 --> 03:38.750
Car door handles,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.385
a telescope and a hose.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.621
Did this junk bring me joy?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.765
Why did I wear
Mother's blouse today?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.237
(muffled clinking)

03:58.239 --> 04:01.473
Ha-ha-ho!
Thank you, Galileo.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.443
Good-bye, Businesswoman
Malibu Stacy,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.345
Plus-Size Malibu Stacy,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.413
and Nongender-Normative
Malibu Stacy.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.783
Your attempts to enter the 21st
century brought joy to no one.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.785
Are they worth anything?

04:13.787 --> 04:16.221
Oh, I'm afraid not, no.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.623
Take 'em.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.525
Aha!

04:20.527 --> 04:24.363
All right, because up until now
I've been such a great guy.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.465
You don't want to get rid
of this fake barf?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.933
Still gives me joy.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.402
This pencil sharpener
shaped like a nose?

04:30.404 --> 04:33.305
<i>That's</i> what it is?
Now I like it even more!

04:33.307 --> 04:36.041
Is there<i> anything</i>
you want to get rid of?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.943
Hmm, let's see.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.311
Joy, joy, joy,

04:39.313 --> 04:40.612
joy, joy, joy, joy...

04:40.614 --> 04:42.047
Milhouse, get
out of the way.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.615
Joy, joy, joy, joy, joy,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.550
and Lisa's only "B."
Super joy.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.719
Huh! It's in phys ed!

04:47.721 --> 04:50.422
I don't want to alarm you,
but grade point average:

04:50.424 --> 04:53.558
3.999999999...

04:53.560 --> 04:55.594
(screaming)

04:55.596 --> 04:57.863
(humming happily)

05:03.137 --> 05:06.438
Listen, Marge, you've had me
throw a lot of things away

05:06.440 --> 05:08.273
that I really loved.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.810
At long last,<i> I'm</i> Mr. Plow!

05:11.812 --> 05:15.580
I was thinking we might
want to save my 2014
Joke-A-Day calendar,

05:15.582 --> 05:18.083
'cause the calendar's the same
in the year 2031,

05:18.085 --> 05:20.285
and we're<i> really</i> gonna need
some laughs then

05:20.287 --> 05:22.020
after World War China.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.156
There is one thing of yours

05:24.158 --> 05:26.925
that's not giving us
much joy anymore.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.593
(quietly): You know
what's not giving me joy

05:28.595 --> 05:29.695
is that Japanese book.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.929
What'd you say?
Nothing.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.299
What I'm talking
about is... Plopper.

05:34.301 --> 05:36.101
(gasps)
Spider-Pig?

05:36.103 --> 05:40.772
♪ Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig ♪

05:40.774 --> 05:42.641
♪ Does whatever ♪

05:42.643 --> 05:44.476
♪ A Spider-Pig does... ♪

05:44.478 --> 05:46.545
We've had him
since you found him,

05:46.547 --> 05:49.314
but I'm the only one
who takes care of him.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.784
How hard can it be
to clean up after a pig?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.721
(grunts)

05:55.723 --> 05:57.456
Okay, okay, I hear you, Marge.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.530
Look, I'm the only one
who feeds him, cleans him,
and maintains his wallow.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.499
I am grateful beyond words.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.001
I bet you didn't even know
it was called a wallow.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.804
I certainly did!
Then tell me what
it's called.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.072
What what was called?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.374
The word I just said.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.042
Marge, I don't know
what the word is.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.177
Let's not wallow
in this all day.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.846
(groans) Please,
just promise

06:20.848 --> 06:23.415
you'll find him a
new place to live.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.417
(Plopper grunting)

06:25.419 --> 06:26.752
(chuckles):
Aw, ha-ha-ha.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.987
That's a Christmas card!

06:28.989 --> 06:30.822
(grunting, squealing)

06:30.824 --> 06:32.824
The music of our lives.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.060
If you don't find
a home for that pig,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.662
I'm going to withhold...
No, whatever you're
going to withhold--

06:37.664 --> 06:39.197
anything but that!

06:39.199 --> 06:40.832
I'll find him a home!

06:43.036 --> 06:45.670
Boy, I really don't want
to get rid of the pig.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.239
Can you talk
to your mother?

06:47.241 --> 06:49.241
We have a pig?
Oh, it's hopeless.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.842
You know, I love
this animal,

06:50.844 --> 06:53.912
so I'm gonna be very
selective with his new owner.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.717
Okay. World's best pig,

06:58.719 --> 07:00.085
Non-smoker only.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.155
By which I mean he can't end up
in your smoker.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.624
(electronic ding)

07:05.626 --> 07:07.559
Wow, I've already
got a taker.

07:07.561 --> 07:11.062
Well, I'm sure he's a
nice, reputable guy.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.633
(rock music playing)

07:14.635 --> 07:16.902
Hello there.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.770
Are you here for my pig?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.606
I might be.
I have to make sure the bacon

07:21.608 --> 07:23.809
is worth the takin'.
You better not eat him!

07:23.811 --> 07:26.578
I have to talk to him
every night on the phone.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.147
We have a code word.
Um, is it "oink"?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.216
Damn it! I'm not
giving him to you!

07:31.218 --> 07:34.820
You make guys with
a windowless van look bad!

07:34.822 --> 07:36.455
Need a ride?

07:36.457 --> 07:37.689
Sure.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.127
Hey, how you doing?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.831
(rock music playing)
HOMER:
So, what do you do?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.166
Oh my God!

07:48.168 --> 07:49.968
(Plopper squeals)

07:49.970 --> 07:51.937
A decluttered life
is a happy life.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.172
A decluttered life is
a happy life.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.141
A decluttered life is a h...
(gasps)

07:56.143 --> 07:58.443
Joyce Carol Oates!

07:58.445 --> 08:00.245
(gasps)
Oh, no!

08:00.247 --> 08:02.447
I threw out my autograph book!

08:02.449 --> 08:04.483
Are you nuts?
You had Dean Cain!

08:04.485 --> 08:07.252
I know I had Dean Cain!

08:07.254 --> 08:09.521
Dad, maybe
she'll sign a menu.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.092
Books and checks--
that's all I sign.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.029
What are you doin'?

08:18.031 --> 08:21.266
You keep-a that unsliced
prosciutto outside
my restaurant!

08:21.268 --> 08:23.768
Wait. How come he
can bring a dog in,

08:23.770 --> 08:26.705
but my pig has to stay outside,
like a common snowman?

08:26.707 --> 08:30.108
Because that-a dog
is a therapy animal.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.545
He's-a licensed to help calm
those with anxiety.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.715
Don't lick my face--
the makeup's lead-based.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.719
But for calming down,
I prefer my mama's methods.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.354
Shut up!

08:42.356 --> 08:45.290
She don't even-a work here.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.792
So if I get that
anxiety diagnosis,

08:47.794 --> 08:49.828
Plopper could
follow me anywhere.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.530
He could live in my office!

08:51.532 --> 08:53.965
Hey, what are
the symptoms of anxiety?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.701
Oh, no, don't try that, Dad.
You might get into trouble.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.170
Just the thought of it
is making me sweat.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.072
And my heart is palpitating.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.974
Lisa, honey,
Daddy will help you,

09:02.976 --> 09:05.977
right after you tell me
the symptoms of anxiety.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.713
(gasping):
You're... looking at them!

09:08.715 --> 09:11.516
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.351
It's okay.
It's... I know.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.086
I'm better now.
It's gonna be okay.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.322
It's okay. I'm better now.
All right, calm down.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.990
Ooh. Heart's racing
like a rabbit.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.859
I have to sit down.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.394
Oh, isn't that-a sweet?

09:22.396 --> 09:26.264
All the little children
have-a the adult anxiety now.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.600
Uh, yeah, I'm really
anxious, Doc.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.603
I'm not sleeping at night,
I'm not sleeping at work...

09:31.605 --> 09:33.738
Okay, okay, I get it.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.508
Here's your prescription
for medicinal marijuana.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.876
I don't want weed!

09:37.878 --> 09:40.512
I'd like a letter
for a therapy animal

09:40.514 --> 09:42.714
of the pig persuasion.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.849
Oh, you fakers disgust me!

09:44.851 --> 09:47.085
Get out! You're
harshing my clinic.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.254
How many opioids
would you like?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.089
I don't want any!

09:51.091 --> 09:54.292
Oh, come on, you've got to
be dependent on<i> something.</i>

09:54.294 --> 09:57.696
I just want a prescription
for a therapy pig.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.632
Fine. Plus five opioids.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.901
<i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.</i>

10:02.903 --> 10:05.170
And one for the doctor.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.773
Ah, ha.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.909
Gee, I didn't realize

10:10.911 --> 10:12.310
you had gone this far.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.946
A great musician only
needs her instrument.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.882
And underwear-- 'cause
this dress is mighty short.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.884
Time for a riff of joy.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.187
(playing mournful melody)

10:24.057 --> 10:28.593
Uh? Holding this, I feel
only hours of tedious practice.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.462
Where is the joy?

10:30.464 --> 10:32.998
(playing mournful melody)

10:38.305 --> 10:40.739
That was beautiful, honey!

10:40.741 --> 10:42.007
No, it wasn't.

-I need you to watch
the kids tonight.
-Oh, I know!

22:53.539 --> 22:55.406
Get one of those guys
outside the hardware stores.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.309
Just act like their aunt
for one day, and I'll get you
the money that you need.

22:58.311 --> 23:00.311
Where are you?
Oh, we had to flee
the country.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.347
-What?
-When you put that character
around children

23:03.349 --> 23:05.216
who are depending on her,
that's pretty terrible.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.918
Whoa! Aaah!

23:07.920 --> 23:11.255
-I think she's dead.
-No!
-(gasps)

23:11.257 --> 23:13.424
Not the qualities
you look for in an auntie.

23:13.426 --> 23:16.260
-She's a danger
to these children.
-The kids are fine!

23:16.262 --> 23:18.262
Mickey, can I have
some more ice cream?

23:18.264 --> 23:19.797
Oh! Aaah!
