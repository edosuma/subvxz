WEBVTT

00:34.670 --> 00:39.884
How many of you sitting in this room
have even seen a black person?

00:43.596 --> 00:45.598
None of you.

00:45.765 --> 00:48.809
The average white man
thinks about sex every six seconds...

00:48.976 --> 00:54.231
...but he only thinks about sex
with a black man once a year.

00:54.398 --> 00:57.610
I have no idea what he's talking about,
but I feel terrible.

00:57.777 --> 01:00.613
So next time you privileged
suburban white boys...

01:00.780 --> 01:05.450
...think Beethoven wasn't black,
maybe you should look in the mirror.

01:07.411 --> 01:11.165
Yeah, so pick a black guy
and do a report.

01:13.709 --> 01:16.711
Wanna play that game where
you start with a tower of blocks...

01:16.878 --> 01:20.131
...and you take them out and
stack them on top until it collapses?

01:20.298 --> 01:23.343
- You mean Jenga?
- I think it's pronounced "Henga"...

01:23.510 --> 01:26.429
...but if you wanna crap
all over the Spanish, go ahead.

01:26.596 --> 01:28.890
Sorry. I have to write
a black-history report...

01:29.057 --> 01:30.725
...and I haven't picked a subject.

01:30.892 --> 01:34.437
How about George Washington Carver?
He invented peanut butter.

01:34.604 --> 01:38.024
Of course. Peanut butter is
my favorite thing in the world.

01:38.191 --> 01:40.568
If it weren't for lo,
the ice moon of Jupiter...

01:40.735 --> 01:44.280
...it'd be my favorite thing
in the solar system. Great idea, Mom.

01:44.447 --> 01:47.492
Oh, my goodness.
Did someone just take my advice?

01:47.659 --> 01:51.538
I have something
I've been saving for just this occasion.

01:57.001 --> 01:59.838
If anyone needs me,
I'll be celebrating in the bathtub.

02:00.004 --> 02:03.675
- Why would anyone need you?
- Shut up, Klaus.

02:07.512 --> 02:10.848
Hey, Hayleykins, wanna play Jenga?

02:11.014 --> 02:12.225
That game's kind of lame.

02:12.392 --> 02:14.978
Unless you wanna make it
a little more interesting.

02:15.145 --> 02:17.856
- No, thanks.
- I thought you loved to gamble.

02:18.022 --> 02:21.025
Oh, is that what that means?
I thought you were hitting on me.

02:21.192 --> 02:23.027
Yeah, no. Sure, yeah, let's play.

02:23.695 --> 02:28.199
- Hey, lights out. It's past your bedtime.
- Dad, I'm too old for a bedtime.

02:28.366 --> 02:29.993
How many times have I told you?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.495
If children get less
than eight hours of sleep...

02:32.662 --> 02:35.999
...their boy glands emit a berry scent
that attracts pedophiles.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.959
I'm not a kid.
You don't have to tell me lies anymore.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.753
And I don't need this
childproof lock on the Internet.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.673
Every time I try to access a site,
I get this:

02:46.842 --> 02:49.011
What kind of filth
are you trying to look up?

02:49.178 --> 02:52.055
I'm doing a report on
George Washington Carver.

02:52.222 --> 02:54.266
Carver? The peanut-butter guy?

02:54.433 --> 02:56.852
Why don't you
pick an interesting black person...

02:57.019 --> 03:00.564
...like Dr. Williams, who performed
the first open-heart surgery...

03:00.731 --> 03:03.275
...or Tim Meadows,
luckiest man in show business?

03:03.442 --> 03:06.111
Dad, I'm old enough to decide
who to do my report on.

03:06.278 --> 03:09.281
I guess I'm gonna have
to start treating you like an adult.

03:10.115 --> 03:13.869
Now don't forget to brush your teeth
or goblins will kill your mother.

03:17.706 --> 03:20.918
Why do you need to go to
a grocery store to research Carver?

03:21.084 --> 03:23.879
To know the man,
I must taste the man.

03:24.046 --> 03:26.632
That's weird.
Hand me a magnifying glass.

03:26.798 --> 03:28.967
- Which one?
- Five-X.

03:29.551 --> 03:32.596
Look at the belt buckle
on the Robin Hood peanut-butter label.

03:32.763 --> 03:35.682
It's the same symbol
as the dot over the I in Jiffy.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.977
It's even on Union Brand,
America's first peanut butter.

03:39.144 --> 03:41.521
- Where?
- In President Peanut's monocle.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.941
- That's just his eye.
- Look closer.

03:46.652 --> 03:48.737
Curiouser and curiouser.

03:48.904 --> 03:51.949
- We've got to get to the bottom of this.
- Count me out.

03:52.115 --> 03:55.035
I gave up sleuthing when
the case of the missing bike horn...

03:55.202 --> 03:57.246
...turned into a double rape-homicide.

03:59.747 --> 04:02.708
I need more time for my report
on George Washington Carver.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.671
The brother invented peanut butter.
Stretch it over five pages and hand it in.

04:06.837 --> 04:08.965
It's deeper than that, sir.

04:09.131 --> 04:12.593
Look. Every jar of peanut butter
has the same symbol on it.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.972
I think there might be
some kind of conspiracy.

04:16.137 --> 04:18.891
Ridiculous. Turn in your paper
or face consequences.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.644
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm going to follow this through.

04:21.810 --> 04:26.232
Even if it means I have to talk to
the creepy librarian with the burned ear.

04:32.822 --> 04:33.864
Yes?

04:34.031 --> 04:38.035
I'm afraid we've got some chocolate
in our peanut butter.

04:39.870 --> 04:43.958
Hello. Are you curator
of the Smithsonian Peanut Museum?

04:44.125 --> 04:45.167
Who wants to know?

04:45.334 --> 04:48.379
Steve Smith.
I'm doing a report on Carver...

04:48.546 --> 04:52.383
...and I have some questions
about a symbol on peanut-butter jars.

04:52.550 --> 04:55.845
- It's probably nothing, but...
- No. It's, like, this huge thing!

04:56.012 --> 04:59.557
It's time the truth came out.
Come see me at 3:00.

04:59.724 --> 05:02.393
And be careful. They're watching you.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.444
Don't worry. I wasn't trying to kill you.
I'm just a drunk driver.

05:17.700 --> 05:20.494
What's going on? I have an appointment
with the curator.

05:20.661 --> 05:24.998
- The curator was murdered.
- Oh, my God. Someone killed him?

05:25.165 --> 05:29.586
- Funny. I never said he was murdered.
- Yes. Yes, you did.

05:29.753 --> 05:31.588
God. He's wedged into the mouth...

05:31.755 --> 05:34.382
...of a giant bust
of George Washington Carver.

05:36.092 --> 05:40.847
- That's classified. How'd you know that?
- I can see it from here.

05:53.485 --> 05:55.570
Okay. That checks out.

05:55.737 --> 05:59.240
Why would the killer stick the curator
to the roof of the statue's mouth?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.367
Like peanut butter.

06:01.534 --> 06:03.912
You don't get it, kid.
He did it to himself.

06:04.078 --> 06:05.872
He was stabbed and left for dead.

06:06.039 --> 06:10.251
He managed to climb up there right after
he scrawled a message in his own blood.

06:10.418 --> 06:13.421
"In the elf condom."
What does it mean?

06:13.588 --> 06:18.051
I'll tell you what: It means we're looking
for a horny midget that plays it safe.

06:18.218 --> 06:20.720
Come on, boys.

06:20.887 --> 06:22.764
"In the elf condom."

06:26.184 --> 06:29.771
Wait. That's an anagram
for "Find the monocle."

06:29.938 --> 06:32.941
My selective dyslexia disorder
finally pays off.

06:34.859 --> 06:37.195
Find the monocle.

06:37.362 --> 06:41.491
Let's see. "Mono" means "one,"
and "cole" is a type of slaw.

06:41.658 --> 06:43.825
I'm looking for one slaw.

06:45.244 --> 06:47.663
I can't think with that clock ticking.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.835
The symbol.

06:55.003 --> 06:56.713
- This is the monocle.
- Hey.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.966
- What are you doing in here?
- Nothing.

07:02.678 --> 07:04.096
Sweet berries.

07:04.263 --> 07:07.224
Hey, champ.
Get enough sleep last night?

07:10.269 --> 07:12.854
Roger, it's been hours.
Are you gonna move or not?

07:13.021 --> 07:15.649
I'm thinking.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.202
You can't take it from the top.

07:30.539 --> 07:33.000
I'm gonna need a minute.

07:33.166 --> 07:37.045
Peanut butter. Crunchy, creamy...

07:37.546 --> 07:40.882
Creamy. No, no, that means nothing.

07:41.049 --> 07:43.802
- Steve Smith, you need to come with us.
- Why?

07:43.969 --> 07:46.096
- You won a free air conditioner.
- Awesome.

07:48.515 --> 07:50.934
Don't even think about running.

07:51.977 --> 07:53.645
Sorry. Just me again.

07:53.812 --> 07:56.606
Looks like I'm hitting everything
but rock bottom, huh?

07:56.773 --> 07:58.859
I gotta go.

08:09.118 --> 08:10.411
Let go of me.

08:17.334 --> 08:20.421
- Don't worry. They're just blanks.
- Why did you do that?

08:20.588 --> 08:23.591
Because that's the last fun
you're gonna have for a long time.

08:23.758 --> 08:26.177
What?
Why are these people chasing me?

08:26.343 --> 08:30.222
You stumbled upon the most dangerous
secret in American history.

08:30.389 --> 08:33.142
Now they want you to pay for it.
With your life.

08:33.976 --> 08:37.520
Steve, keep it down. I don't think
we're supposed to be on this roof.

08:41.192 --> 08:44.028
- Dad, what the hell is going on?
- You're in over your head.

08:44.195 --> 08:47.531
Forget your report on Carver.
Just do it on Will Smith.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.408
Oh, wait, you need a black guy.

08:49.575 --> 08:53.913
Dad, a museum curator was murdered
and his dying message led me to this.

08:54.079 --> 08:56.540
- The monocle.
- You know what this is?

08:56.707 --> 09:00.377
- Give it to me. This isn't child's play.
- And I'm not a child.

09:01.337 --> 09:05.758
Okay, Steve, you win.
We'll solve this thing together.

09:05.925 --> 09:10.179
Bobby Brown. He's black.
Bobby Brown. I did it.

09:12.765 --> 09:17.728
Steve, this conspiracy dates back
to the Civil War. This is what I know.

09:17.895 --> 09:20.606
- Is that President Lincoln?
- Yes.

09:20.773 --> 09:24.777
It was 1865. The North's victory
over the South was imminent.

09:24.944 --> 09:27.779
We can force emancipation
of the slaves upon the South...

09:27.946 --> 09:31.241
...but those crackers will never
embrace the Negro as their equal.

09:31.407 --> 09:32.700
Speaking of crackers...

09:32.867 --> 09:36.329
...what is this delicious paste
upon which I am snacking?

09:36.496 --> 09:40.250
- It tastes as if derived of the nutted pea.
- Don't eat that.

09:40.416 --> 09:45.171
That's one of my wife's lunatic
concoctions for staving off evil spirits.

09:46.422 --> 09:50.009
One day,
a man will walk on the moon.

09:50.176 --> 09:53.596
His name, Armey Neilstrong.

09:55.306 --> 09:57.350
This is delicious.

09:57.517 --> 10:01.437
What? Upon my chain
you surely do yank.

10:02.480 --> 10:07.151
Gentlemen, the solution to our problem
is spread before us.

10:07.318 --> 10:08.820
<i>Lincoln 's plan was simple.</i>

10:08.987 --> 10:11.656
<i>He would introduce this
delicious spread to the South...</i>

10:11.823 --> 10:14.200
<i>... and credit its invention
to a black man.</i>

10:14.367 --> 10:17.787
<i>He was certain the most bitter
Confederate would embrace slaves...</i>

10:17.954 --> 10:20.999
<i>... if one of them was responsible
for such a tasty treat.</i>

10:21.165 --> 10:23.418
<i>Unfortunately, John Wilkes Booth...</i>

10:23.584 --> 10:25.795
<i>... who despised legume-based
racial harmony...</i>

10:25.962 --> 10:29.215
<i>... got wind of the plan
and made sure it died with Lincoln.</i>

10:33.636 --> 10:37.765
Without the salve of peanut butter,
the nation's wounds healed slowly.

10:37.932 --> 10:41.352
It wasn't until thirty-one years later
that the plan was resurrected...

10:41.519 --> 10:45.148
...by our nation's greatest president,
Grover Cleveland.

10:45.315 --> 10:49.277
Cleveland learned of a black botanist
who had hundreds of uses for peanuts.

10:49.444 --> 10:52.612
Incredibly, mashing them up
and eating them wasn't one of them.

10:52.779 --> 10:55.240
But Cleveland constructed
an ingenious plan...

10:55.407 --> 10:59.077
...allowing Carver
to receive credit for the invention.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.212
George Washington Carver
didn't invent peanut butter.

11:09.379 --> 11:12.966
That's right. You're one of the few
people outside of the Illuminutti...

11:13.133 --> 11:14.509
...who knows this secret.

11:14.676 --> 11:17.012
- The Illuminutti?
- That's who's chasing us.

11:17.179 --> 11:21.183
A secret society dedicated
to concealing this truth at all costs.

11:21.349 --> 11:23.560
This is their mysterious symbol.

11:23.727 --> 11:28.940
- The peanut in the pyramid.
- Oh, yeah. I guess that is what it is.

11:29.107 --> 11:31.693
After the war,
our nation was healed by the belief...

11:31.860 --> 11:34.237
...that peanut butter was invented
by a black man.

11:34.404 --> 11:37.866
The Illuminutti is convinced that
our country will descend into chaos...

11:38.033 --> 11:39.576
...if this lie is ever exposed.

11:39.743 --> 11:43.246
- That's why they killed the curator.
- Okay, loud. Loud.

11:43.413 --> 11:46.541
He said it was time the truth came out.
We have to tell everyone.

11:46.708 --> 11:51.004
Yes. But no one will believe us
unless we have the jar of proof.

11:51.171 --> 11:54.966
A jar containing evidence that Carver
didn't invent peanut butter.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.594
- Where is this jar?
- Only the curator knew.

11:57.761 --> 12:00.138
The Illuminutti's
been looking for it for decades.

12:00.305 --> 12:02.474
And when they find it,
they'll destroy it.

12:02.641 --> 12:05.727
We've got to find it first
so America will know the truth.

12:05.894 --> 12:09.064
Well, we do have one thing
the Illuminutti doesn't:

12:09.231 --> 12:11.107
A map I found years ago.

12:11.274 --> 12:15.444
Unfortunately, it can only be read
with a special ocular device.

12:15.611 --> 12:19.615
- The monocle.
- Yes, Steve. How does that feel?

12:22.576 --> 12:26.997
- It works. You can read the map.
- Dad, it's not a map, it's a message.

12:27.164 --> 12:31.460
"Find the cane that bore Old Glory.
1730 M Street."

12:31.627 --> 12:34.672
Old Glory. It must be a flagpole.

12:34.839 --> 12:35.923
Good work, Dad.

12:36.090 --> 12:39.134
But why did we have to come
to a Burger King to read the map?

12:39.301 --> 12:43.097
Because the economics of television
have changed, Steve.

12:43.264 --> 12:46.016
Have it your way.

12:52.648 --> 12:56.402
Oh, my God. You finally
make your first move and you lose.

12:56.569 --> 12:59.321
- That's classic. I'm going to bed.
- Not so fast.

12:59.488 --> 13:03.742
That was just my test model.
The real one still stands. It's permitted.

13:03.909 --> 13:04.952
I called Hasbro.

13:05.119 --> 13:10.082
They said it violated the spirit
of the game, but not the actual rules.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.962
Well, this is the address,
but I don't see any flagpoles.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.590
Just an old strip club.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.265
Well, no flagpoles in the VIP room.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.726
It took you 45 minutes
to figure that out?

13:28.892 --> 13:31.186
No. And it also didn't take me $300.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.813
Dad, Old Glory wasn't a flag.

13:33.980 --> 13:39.193
She was our nation's first stripper,
and that's the pole that bore her.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.238
Look, the symbol.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.365
We gotta get that pole.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.201
Excuse me, ladies.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.538
If anyone has left a toddler
locked in their car...

13:50.705 --> 13:52.248
...he just found your stash.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.043
- My baby.
- My meth.

13:58.212 --> 14:02.091
- I can't believe you brought an engineer.
- I can't believe you didn't.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.554
Here's 49 moves that won't compromise
the integrity of the structure.

14:06.721 --> 14:10.183
Yeah, I don't really trust computers.
I'm just gonna go with my heart.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.062
- Then why'd you hire me?
- Hire you?

14:17.648 --> 14:20.985
- Steve, are you sure about this?
- Stop treating me like a kid.

14:21.152 --> 14:24.030
I was right about the pole, wasn't I?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.913
It's working.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.751
Soon the beam of light will show us
the exact location of the...

14:36.918 --> 14:40.505
Steve, what have you done?
You've ruined everything.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.548
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm...

14:42.715 --> 14:45.468
A genius. Look.

14:46.469 --> 14:50.014
"Lastly, tip your hat
in the Garden of Eden."

14:50.181 --> 14:53.184
- It's the last clue.
- Really?

14:53.351 --> 14:57.437
- Sorry, it's been a really long night.
- The Garden of Eden.

14:57.604 --> 14:59.397
I'm on it.

14:59.564 --> 15:02.901
I'm gonna need two tickets on
your next flight to the Garden of Eden.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.279
The Garden of Eden. The first garden.

15:06.446 --> 15:08.365
You don't fly to biblical allegories?

15:08.532 --> 15:11.201
See, this is why you people
are going out of business.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.663
I've got it. The first national garden.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.585
But this is the only peanut plant
in this whole place.

15:20.752 --> 15:22.254
The hat has gotta be in here.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.714
- It's empty.
- It's a dead end.

15:24.881 --> 15:26.466
Fudge.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.135
Wait, Steve.
Don't declare fudge just yet.

15:29.302 --> 15:31.096
Look, the symbol.

15:31.263 --> 15:35.016
And the pot is shaped like a hat.
It's the last piece of the puzzle.

15:35.183 --> 15:39.271
Wait a minute. Monocle, cane, hat...

15:39.437 --> 15:42.524
All the clues
are things that President Peanut wears.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.818
Great work, Steve. All we need now...

15:44.985 --> 15:47.863
...is a 20-foot peanut
with presidential aspirations.

15:48.029 --> 15:50.657
- To the lowa caucuses.
- No, Dad.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.660
What we need is a 20-foot president.

15:59.165 --> 16:02.878
Of course.
Lincoln was the father of the conspiracy.

16:03.044 --> 16:06.798
The original President Peanut.
Well, here goes.

16:21.061 --> 16:23.147
Oh, God.

16:23.314 --> 16:28.027
- The jar of proof must be in there.
- Hidden up Lincoln's proof chute.

16:28.193 --> 16:30.904
We did it, Dad. Soon the whole world
will know the truth.

16:31.071 --> 16:33.866
Nothing can stop us now.

16:44.043 --> 16:46.045
I'll go first.

16:47.546 --> 16:51.717
Careful. These stairs
will be dangerous without a banister.

16:51.884 --> 16:53.594
Dad.

16:53.761 --> 16:57.556
Dad. Dad. Dad.

16:57.723 --> 16:59.933
Dad. Dad.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.979
Almost there, Dad.
Hey, look. Funny pages from 1916.

17:04.146 --> 17:06.190
The Katzenjammer Kids.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.817
Let's see.
They're putting their dad in a barrel...

17:08.983 --> 17:10.944
...and rolling it down a steep hill.

17:11.111 --> 17:13.405
And now he's injured.

17:14.531 --> 17:17.826
That's not funny.
I guess comedy's really evolved.

17:17.992 --> 17:20.496
Thanks, Harvard.

17:20.662 --> 17:22.830
And that's where babies come from.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.001
Look out, Dad.

17:26.167 --> 17:28.796
I can't believe there's lava
under Washington, D.C.

17:28.962 --> 17:32.841
Where do you think
all the hot air comes from?

17:41.766 --> 17:45.436
- Oh, my God, I see it. I'm going in.
- Finally.

17:52.944 --> 17:55.029
Okay, your turn.

17:57.532 --> 17:59.158
Come on, already.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.496
Hot air.

18:03.663 --> 18:05.873
Politics.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.208
Funny.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.961
Dad, there it is.

18:11.629 --> 18:13.548
The jar of proof.

18:18.344 --> 18:21.430
Can't reach it. Steve, I'll help you up.

18:26.185 --> 18:29.814
- Booby trap.
- There's something inside.

18:29.981 --> 18:32.942
It's a playbill from the night
Lincoln was assassinated.

18:33.109 --> 18:36.529
It's got his blood and all the names
he considered for peanut butter.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.573
Yeah, yeah. Now hand it over.

18:38.739 --> 18:41.492
Now the world
can know the truth, right, Dad?

18:41.659 --> 18:43.870
Yeah, sure. Give me, give me.

18:45.955 --> 18:47.373
Finally, the...

18:47.540 --> 18:52.378
Wait. This isn't the jar of proof.
He switched them on me.

18:52.545 --> 18:53.796
Steve.

18:53.963 --> 18:55.006
You're one of them.

18:55.172 --> 18:58.801
You don't care about the truth.
You're just gonna destroy it.

18:58.968 --> 19:02.846
- It's over, boy. Give me the jar.
- President Jimmy Carter?

19:03.013 --> 19:06.224
That's right.
The second President Peanut.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.643
I'm sorry, son.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.271
When were you gonna tell me
you were Illuminutti?

19:11.438 --> 19:13.857
Steve, that's crazy.
I was never gonna tell you.

19:14.024 --> 19:16.860
All this time, I thought
I was proving I was so grown-up...

19:17.027 --> 19:19.404
...but you saw me as a stupid kid
you could use...

19:19.571 --> 19:21.406
...to find your precious jar of proof.

19:21.573 --> 19:24.075
Precious indeed. Without this secret...

19:24.242 --> 19:26.494
...our young nation
would have never survived.

19:26.661 --> 19:30.332
Steve, if you were a grownup, you'd
understand why we have to destroy it.

19:30.498 --> 19:33.835
- The truth would tear this country apart.
- Maybe back then.

19:34.002 --> 19:36.713
But America's a big boy now,
and so am I.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.298
We can handle the truth...

19:38.465 --> 19:41.217
...whether it's about bedtime
or black people.

19:43.219 --> 19:45.722
Enough. Give me the jar
and let's be done with it.

19:45.889 --> 19:48.975
- Dad, don't do it.
- Trust me, son.

19:49.142 --> 19:52.395
I'm doing the grown-up thing here.

19:55.482 --> 19:59.277
And so the safety of our nation
will forever be ensured.

19:59.444 --> 20:02.280
God bless Ameri...

20:09.996 --> 20:11.373
Let's get out of here.

20:19.047 --> 20:22.467
Wow, Dad, you switched jars on him.
That was so awesome.

20:22.634 --> 20:26.220
Well, I learned it from you.
I guess maybe you are all grown-up.

20:26.387 --> 20:27.429
Thanks, Dad.

20:27.596 --> 20:30.432
Now come on.
We've got some truth to spread.

20:30.599 --> 20:32.726
Wait. That's the wrong jar.

20:32.893 --> 20:36.230
- What? That's impossible.
- You made the switch. What happened?

20:36.397 --> 20:40.442
I had to make the switch? I thought
it was a magic backpack or something.

20:40.609 --> 20:42.444
No, it wasn't.

20:42.611 --> 20:44.571
Now the world
will never know the truth.

20:44.738 --> 20:49.201
If only there was a place you could make
any claim you want with no proof...

20:49.368 --> 20:51.954
...and millions of people would
accept it as fact.

20:52.121 --> 20:53.163
That's it.

20:54.540 --> 20:56.625
Thanks for taking that block off, Dad.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.293
Well, you're a young man now.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.046
You're ready for everything
the Internet has to offer.

21:01.213 --> 21:04.091
- Even porn.
- Wow, porn.

21:04.258 --> 21:07.302
This is the best Black History Month
ever.

21:51.262 --> 21:53.347
