WEBVTT

00:00.653 --> 00:01.947
It's not my fault you and your brother

00:01.950 --> 00:04.119
are the most wanted fugitives
in the world. That is on you.

00:05.611 --> 00:08.050
Dad is losing it. He is not
in a good place right now.

00:08.052 --> 00:10.213
And mom always knew
how to take care of him.

00:10.576 --> 00:11.985
You know the one who got the brother.

00:11.998 --> 00:15.153
Summoned to the underworld,
tricked the gods. Tricked them out.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.834
Then beat them at their own game.

00:16.859 --> 00:19.228
It was never gonna be you and
me, it was always you and Richie!

00:19.432 --> 00:20.941
He is not crazy!

00:21.416 --> 00:24.175
- I see too much.
- Come to me.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.482
He is trying to see the other side.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.148
- This is not who you are.
- It is me.

00:41.648 --> 00:43.749
The road is long.

00:43.751 --> 00:46.285
The path uncertain.

00:46.287 --> 00:50.389
For so many of us, the
journey is one of solitude.

00:50.391 --> 00:55.694
We tell ourselves we must
walk this arduous road alone.

00:55.696 --> 00:58.931
Face whatever comes,
no matter how terrible.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.700
Some of us call on angels

01:01.702 --> 01:05.904
to spread their wings and protect us.

01:05.906 --> 01:08.407
Others long to see the path,

01:08.409 --> 01:10.776
hoping they will come to know the way

01:10.778 --> 01:12.845
through the Lord's nourishment.

01:12.847 --> 01:15.814
What if we are shown the way?

01:15.816 --> 01:18.017
Will we continue on this road,

01:18.019 --> 01:21.820
alone, blind, and afraid?

01:21.822 --> 01:26.925
Or will we have the
strength to follow his path?

01:26.927 --> 01:31.030
That is why I am here
today... To honor a man

01:31.032 --> 01:33.832
who sees with better
eyes than the rest of us.

01:33.834 --> 01:38.904
He has shown us God's path to salvation.

01:38.906 --> 01:42.708
Through his ministry, he
has saved so many lives,

01:42.710 --> 01:43.876
including mine.

01:43.878 --> 01:46.979
My husband, Jacob Fuller.

02:04.664 --> 02:06.799
That better not be Kyle.

02:06.801 --> 02:08.834
Shut your trap.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.803
We're gonna stop the first place we see.

02:10.805 --> 02:11.937
We're gonna do what?

02:11.939 --> 02:13.739
Daddy is drunk.

02:13.741 --> 02:15.908
He needs to sleep it off in
an honest-to-goodness bed.

02:15.910 --> 02:17.042
Let him sleep right there.

02:17.044 --> 02:18.410
You should keep driving to Mexico.

02:18.412 --> 02:20.479
I'm not going to Mexico.

02:20.481 --> 02:22.715
If anything, I'd drive back to Bethel,

02:22.717 --> 02:24.416
but I can't do that, either.

02:24.418 --> 02:25.884
Since when do you call all the shots?

02:25.886 --> 02:27.686
Since now.

02:27.688 --> 02:28.954
There... The closest place

02:28.956 --> 02:30.823
is something called the Dew Drop Inn.

02:30.825 --> 02:32.358
Sounds cute.

02:38.898 --> 02:40.899
Housekeeping!

02:43.036 --> 02:44.403
Time to clean your room, son.

02:44.405 --> 02:45.871
Uh, we... We don't need it.

02:46.973 --> 02:49.108
You better not be making a mess in there.

02:49.110 --> 02:50.976
You see, the thing is, ma'am, my, um...

02:50.978 --> 02:52.444
My girlfriend is still asleep.

02:52.446 --> 02:53.812
You know, we kind of had a...

02:53.814 --> 02:55.914
You know, late night last night.

02:55.916 --> 02:57.983
You can come back tomorrow,
though, if you like.

02:57.985 --> 02:59.518
I'll come back when I damn well please.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.322
Okay. Thank you.

03:03.324 --> 03:04.923
- I wish you would let me tell you...
- Shut up. No talking.

03:04.925 --> 03:06.692
We need to think. Okay?

03:06.694 --> 03:08.627
Half the ticket takers on the Rio Grande

03:08.629 --> 03:10.362
are gonna have copies of our mug shot.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.331
We need a way across. We need it right now.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.799
Just listen to me.

03:13.801 --> 03:15.434
I should have listened
to Uncle Eddie. You know?

03:15.436 --> 03:17.069
Guys like us, we're always
talking about getting out,

03:17.071 --> 03:18.771
living in paradise.

03:18.773 --> 03:20.439
You know, talk about it all day long.

03:20.441 --> 03:22.074
We never actually get there.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.075
Seth.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.376
Something happened to me.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.944
Yes, Richard.

03:25.946 --> 03:27.446
Something is happening.

03:27.448 --> 03:29.381
Now, I have tried to understand it.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.850
I have. But I can't.

03:31.852 --> 03:33.419
And somehow, I don't think

03:33.421 --> 03:35.854
that you're gonna be able
to explain that to me.

03:38.858 --> 03:41.060
I could see inside her.

03:41.062 --> 03:42.761
What the hell does that even mean?

03:42.763 --> 03:44.063
I could see.

03:44.065 --> 03:45.764
I knew she was gonna hurt me.

03:46.901 --> 03:48.367
I knew it. It was in her eyes.

03:48.369 --> 03:49.868
And I don't know how
to explain it right now,

03:49.870 --> 03:51.103
but I want to figure it out.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.671
Well, you're not gonna figure it out here.

03:52.673 --> 03:54.473
All right? We cannot stay here.

03:56.876 --> 03:59.411
You want to know what
else Uncle Eddie says?

03:59.413 --> 04:01.680
What?

04:01.682 --> 04:03.415
It's how we're gonna get across, too.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.983
What, Richard? What is it?

04:04.985 --> 04:07.886
There's an old Indian
saying he told me once.

04:09.889 --> 04:12.358
"Eyes find eyes."

04:12.360 --> 04:15.861
You see, our eyes are
the source of our energy.

04:15.863 --> 04:17.696
You can always feel somebody's eyes on you,

04:17.697 --> 04:18.964
but what you're actually feeling

04:18.966 --> 04:22.101
is their energy directed right at you.

04:22.103 --> 04:23.902
Now, what happens if you close your eyes?

04:23.904 --> 04:24.903
What?

04:24.905 --> 04:27.806
You cut off your energy.

04:27.808 --> 04:29.074
If you can just shut down,

04:29.076 --> 04:31.043
not only will people not see you,

04:31.045 --> 04:32.878
but they'll see through you.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.481
The greatest cat burglar in
the history of cat burglars

04:35.483 --> 04:36.715
taught him that.

04:36.717 --> 04:38.450
Close our eyes.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.853
That's your plan? Close our eyes?

04:42.021 --> 04:44.156
Okay. I got to get out of here.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.892
All right, you, uh, brush up
on your Spanish or something.

04:55.135 --> 04:56.969
I got dibs on the bed.

04:56.971 --> 04:58.937
I'm not sleeping with dad.

04:58.939 --> 05:00.806
I'm too old for that.

05:08.948 --> 05:11.150
What in the world?

05:11.152 --> 05:12.551
It's just some weirdo.

05:17.857 --> 05:20.526
What is his problem?

05:58.927 --> 06:03.527
Synced and corrected by
Oyku Buyuk www.addic7ed.com

06:07.208 --> 06:09.608
Sir, thanks for returning my call.

06:09.610 --> 06:11.110
I thought I told you to stay put.

06:11.112 --> 06:12.811
Don't try selling me any horse pucky

06:12.813 --> 06:13.912
about a cartel killer.

06:13.914 --> 06:15.381
You're just trying to justify

06:15.383 --> 06:17.816
going on a tear after them geckos.

06:17.818 --> 06:19.818
I'm just reading the evidence.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.854
Well, I'm standing next to a body

06:21.856 --> 06:23.889
out in the middle of nowhere,
and he's been dead about what?

06:23.891 --> 06:25.157
Looks like about two hours.

06:25.159 --> 06:26.859
Looks like he's been bled out.

06:26.861 --> 06:28.727
Did you hear that?

06:28.729 --> 06:30.929
And he's still got his eyes.

06:30.931 --> 06:32.998
That doesn't match the
killer you're tracking.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.533
Does that mean anything to you?

06:34.535 --> 06:36.135
Sir, I brought in an expert.

06:36.137 --> 06:38.470
He says we're not just
dealing with a cartel.

06:38.472 --> 06:39.938
Like, some kind of blood cult.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.941
They worship an ancient
Mexican God of death.

06:42.943 --> 06:47.880
Ranger, my son tells me lots
of crazy things when I get home.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.948
That's 'cause he's high on weed.

06:49.950 --> 06:52.017
Don't make me listen to it at work.

06:52.019 --> 06:53.952
The geckos are crossing at Acuna.

06:53.954 --> 06:56.088
They're gonna get help from this cartel.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.956
I just need you to call it in.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.192
I'll call the border boys...
If you swear to me right now

07:00.194 --> 07:02.060
you're gonna turn around and head home.

07:02.062 --> 07:04.563
Earl told me not to rest
until these geckos were dead.

07:04.565 --> 07:06.899
My hand to God, that's the
last thing he said to me.

07:06.901 --> 07:09.501
Guess I'm answering to a higher power now.

07:09.503 --> 07:10.903
Some free advice, son...

07:10.905 --> 07:14.940
You find yourself in a hole, stop digging.

07:16.776 --> 07:19.845
That said, I see why you
can't let go of the shovel.

07:19.847 --> 07:22.981
I'll call it in.

07:22.983 --> 07:25.150
But you call me soon as you got anything.

07:25.152 --> 07:26.118
Deal?

07:27.454 --> 07:28.887
Deal.

07:47.541 --> 07:49.141
I didn't get shot so these son of bitches

07:49.143 --> 07:50.909
could ride off into the sunset.

07:50.911 --> 07:52.544
You promise me something.

07:52.546 --> 07:54.079
You kill these bastards.

07:54.081 --> 07:56.982
I swear on my daughter, I will.

08:02.890 --> 08:05.824
What can I do you for?

08:05.826 --> 08:07.259
Fill 'er up.

08:12.966 --> 08:14.566
You could have dropped us off first.

08:14.568 --> 08:16.835
I mean, like, why'd you
have to park so far away?

08:16.837 --> 08:19.037
I am the driver. I park where I please.

08:19.039 --> 08:21.139
I don't even
know why you're driving.

08:21.141 --> 08:23.575
Dad half-drunk can drive
better than you ever could.

08:23.577 --> 08:25.010
Dad!

08:25.012 --> 08:26.144
What makes you think
you can talk like that?

08:26.146 --> 08:27.546
I was just kidding.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.648
We're still a clean family.

08:29.650 --> 08:30.949
Show some respect.

08:30.951 --> 08:33.184
Dad. Stop.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.020
Dad.

08:52.572 --> 08:55.307
Kate, mind if I take the bed?

08:55.309 --> 08:58.544
No, not at all. I'm going to the pool.

09:06.220 --> 09:07.286
Katey-kakes.

09:07.288 --> 09:09.688
Open the door.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.091
Now.

09:22.201 --> 09:25.237
I'm sorry about the drink.

09:26.573 --> 09:28.640
I was just...

09:28.642 --> 09:30.909
Taking the foot off the gas, so to speak.

09:30.911 --> 09:32.945
It won't happen again.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.313
Good.

09:34.315 --> 09:36.915
Are we done?

09:36.917 --> 09:38.917
You want to tell me
what's going on with you?

09:38.919 --> 09:41.019
Nothing is going on with me.

09:41.021 --> 09:43.121
You really want to turn
the whole ship around?

09:43.123 --> 09:45.123
- Yes. I do.
- Why?

09:47.026 --> 09:49.928
I don't feel safe with you anymore.

09:49.930 --> 09:52.931
I don't feel like I can trust you.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.233
You're not acting like yourself.

09:56.970 --> 10:00.238
Katey, I'm really sorry.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.940
I really am.

10:01.942 --> 10:05.043
I think in time, you'll
look back on this trip

10:05.045 --> 10:07.045
and you'll realize how important it was...

10:07.047 --> 10:10.349
Regardless of your opinion of me.

10:11.751 --> 10:13.251
Can I change now?

10:13.253 --> 10:17.723
If there's something more
that I did to let you down,

10:17.725 --> 10:19.257
I apologize.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.191
Hey, there, old-timer. Say, listen.

10:53.193 --> 10:56.995
Um, where's a good place to get
something to eat around here?

10:56.997 --> 10:59.765
What do I look like, the
damn Chamber of Commerce?

11:00.433 --> 11:03.435
Look, I'm just trying
to find somewhere to eat.

11:03.437 --> 11:06.004
I don't care where you eat,

11:06.006 --> 11:07.406
as long as you don't eat in that room.

11:07.408 --> 11:09.307
If I smell food coming out of that room,

11:09.309 --> 11:11.309
I'm gonna throw your
ass out on that street,

11:11.311 --> 11:13.145
and don't you think I won't do it.

11:15.214 --> 11:17.215
You know what? Just forget it. It's okay.

11:17.217 --> 11:19.751
Hey, I don't need to forget
it. I've already forgot it.

11:19.753 --> 11:22.120
Don't you forget what I just told you.

11:22.122 --> 11:26.425
Okay. You have a nice day.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.234
Hey, dad.

11:36.236 --> 11:39.171
I need to get one of
the bags out of the RV.

11:45.245 --> 11:47.045
Did you order a pizza?

11:47.047 --> 11:48.346
No.

11:50.350 --> 11:52.050
Hi.

11:52.052 --> 11:54.086
You know, we're actually
in the room just below you.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.254
Do you think you could keep the
noise level down a little bit?

11:56.256 --> 11:57.889
What's that, now?

12:04.864 --> 12:07.499
The man said shut your mouth.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.170
So, what's with the Asian kid?

12:13.642 --> 12:15.141
Trick-or-treat
for UNICEF?

12:17.011 --> 12:18.678
He's my son.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.680
Really?

12:20.682 --> 12:21.848
Well, where's mom?

12:21.850 --> 12:23.116
It's just me and the boy.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.817
What about that girl?

12:24.819 --> 12:28.054
She was driving the RV, remember?

12:28.056 --> 12:29.188
Seth.

12:31.392 --> 12:33.126
You two like to play dress-up?

12:33.128 --> 12:34.994
No, we do not.

12:34.996 --> 12:36.696
Where is she?

12:36.698 --> 12:38.898
She went for a grocery
run for the motor home.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.400
She won't be back for hours.

12:40.402 --> 12:41.134
He's lying.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.201
Call her.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.033
She's not answering.

13:14.035 --> 13:15.802
She put this on before she left.

13:15.804 --> 13:17.970
She's probably at the pool.

13:19.039 --> 13:20.807
I'll go get her.

13:24.945 --> 13:26.779
Actually...

13:26.781 --> 13:28.815
You go get her, Richie.

13:28.817 --> 13:30.950
You spent enough time in hotels today.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.255
Hey.

13:36.257 --> 13:37.790
I need you to just go find her,

13:37.792 --> 13:39.192
and you bring her back here, okay?

13:39.194 --> 13:41.094
Don't talk to her. Don't touch her.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.995
Let's get on the clock.

13:42.997 --> 13:44.330
10:00 on the Timex.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.968
I've got this under control.

13:57.478 --> 14:01.948
<i>"Case number 349235.</i>

14:01.950 --> 14:04.884
<i>"Driver was Pastor Jacob Fuller.</i>

14:04.886 --> 14:08.221
<i>"Passenger was his spouse, Jennifer Fuller.</i>

14:08.223 --> 14:10.823
<i>"Mr. Fuller appears to have
lost control of the vehicle</i>

14:10.825 --> 14:12.959
<i>"coming off the bend on Montgomery.</i>

14:12.961 --> 14:16.095
<i>At least, that's what the
suspect initially reported."</i>

14:16.097 --> 14:17.830
I already told you what happened.

14:17.832 --> 14:19.499
My brakes needed replacing.

14:19.501 --> 14:21.901
<i>"Our inspection showed
the brakes were fine...</i>

14:21.903 --> 14:24.237
<i>Pads and rotors at acceptable levels."</i>

14:24.239 --> 14:28.841
And I was coming 'round that
bend on Montgomery, and...

14:28.843 --> 14:30.943
There was a deer, and I swerved and...

14:30.945 --> 14:33.112
<i>"Proximity of the street
lamp makes it unlikely</i>

14:33.114 --> 14:34.514
<i>"wild animals would venture</i>

14:34.516 --> 14:36.883
<i>"onto that section of the highway.</i>

14:36.885 --> 14:38.251
<i>"Analysis of the road surface</i>

14:38.253 --> 14:41.287
<i>"shows a defined pattern
and friction force.</i>

14:41.289 --> 14:45.925
<i>The vehicle was traveling in
excess of 70 miles per hour."</i>

14:47.861 --> 14:51.197
<i>"Blood tests concur with
the on-site breathalyzer."</i>

14:54.536 --> 14:56.002
Katey-kakes?

14:56.004 --> 14:57.303
<i>"Mr. Fuller's blood-alcohol level</i>

14:57.305 --> 14:59.138
<i>was below the legal limit.</i>

14:59.140 --> 15:01.174
<i>"He was not impaired.</i>

15:01.176 --> 15:03.543
<i>"However, inspection of lacerations</i>

15:03.545 --> 15:07.313
<i>on Mr. Fuller's arms
revealed an alternate cause."</i>

15:07.315 --> 15:09.549
<i>"Subject reported being involved</i>

15:09.551 --> 15:13.853
<i>in an altercation with his
wife just before the crash."</i>

15:13.855 --> 15:17.290
"Altercation with his wife."

15:17.292 --> 15:21.327
Through his ministry,
he has saved so many lives,

15:21.329 --> 15:23.062
including mine.

15:23.064 --> 15:25.298
My husband, Jacob Fuller.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.313
Lord, heal thy servant, Jenny.

15:40.315 --> 15:44.217
Relieve her from her pain and sorrow

15:44.219 --> 15:47.587
so that she might better serve
you and her family in this life.

15:47.589 --> 15:50.256
She has struggled to stay on the path

15:50.258 --> 15:52.058
that you have laid for her.

15:52.060 --> 15:56.162
May you clear her road so
that she can find her way.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.263
Amen.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.245
What's wrong with mama?

16:12.247 --> 16:14.313
How long have you been standing there?

16:14.315 --> 16:15.915
I just got here.

16:15.917 --> 16:18.618
It's another migraine.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.419
Your poor mother is suffering.

16:21.622 --> 16:23.422
No, she needs her rest.

16:23.424 --> 16:27.026
If you want to help her, pray for her.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.197
What are you hiding, daddy?

17:17.678 --> 17:19.145
You okay?

17:23.183 --> 17:25.984
I'm... I'm fine.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.152
Richie?

18:01.221 --> 18:04.423
Would you take off my
bikini for me, please?

18:14.735 --> 18:17.370
Can I have one of those?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.140
Didn't your daddy tell
you never to do this?

18:21.142 --> 18:23.075
Do what?

18:23.077 --> 18:24.744
Talk to strangers.

18:24.746 --> 18:27.380
My daddy says a lot of things.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.216
Hmm.

18:30.218 --> 18:32.752
You on vacation or something?

18:32.754 --> 18:34.353
Sorta.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.390
Not much of a vacation, huh?

18:37.392 --> 18:39.358
Oh, I don't know.

18:39.360 --> 18:43.396
Who needs the Bahamas when
you have the dew drop inn?

18:50.071 --> 18:52.471
Eric! Mikey! Slow down!

18:52.473 --> 18:54.106
Wait for me.

18:57.811 --> 18:59.512
You sure you're okay?

18:59.514 --> 19:02.515
Do you ever feel like...

19:02.517 --> 19:06.385
Your life and... And
everything in it is just...

19:06.387 --> 19:08.387
Slowly turning upside down,

19:08.389 --> 19:12.158
like a... Ship flipping over in the ocean?

19:13.193 --> 19:15.461
You have no idea.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.201
Housekeeping!

19:26.441 --> 19:29.608
Uh, we're still sleeping. Can
you come back later, please?

19:40.621 --> 19:42.321
Come on, Richie.

19:42.323 --> 19:44.123
The infamous gecko brothers.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.126
I didn't say you could get up.

19:47.128 --> 19:48.561
I heard about you on the radio.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.563
I switched the channel so
it wouldn't scare my kids.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.631
You did the right thing. Now sit.

19:52.633 --> 19:55.367
Radio said you robbed a bank up in Abilene.

19:55.369 --> 19:58.838
You're moving south...
Means you're going to Mexico.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.107
That's what you need us for, isn't it?

20:01.109 --> 20:03.342
You're gonna use us to
cross. We're your cover.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.144
You're a smart man.

20:05.146 --> 20:06.846
You ever do any acting?

20:06.848 --> 20:08.280
Acting?

20:08.282 --> 20:09.849
Yeah... drama club, high school.

20:09.851 --> 20:11.250
Nothing like that?

20:13.854 --> 20:15.855
Once, a long time ago.

20:15.857 --> 20:17.456
- Well, who'd you play?
- Joseph.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.458
Joseph who?

20:19.460 --> 20:20.593
Joseph, son of Jacob.

20:20.595 --> 20:21.594
Interesting guy?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.229
He could see the future.

20:23.231 --> 20:24.864
Sounds handy.

20:24.866 --> 20:26.866
Now, did they teach you
anything about acting?

20:26.868 --> 20:29.869
Uh, what's the point?

20:29.871 --> 20:31.871
You see, in my line,
you're always a performer.

20:31.873 --> 20:33.205
You understand?

20:33.207 --> 20:35.407
Now, I like actors. I study them.

20:35.409 --> 20:36.575
Pacino, McQueen, Brando...

20:36.577 --> 20:38.177
They got a way of looking believable.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.147
You believe me?

20:42.682 --> 20:45.217
Now, the first rule of good acting

20:45.219 --> 20:48.254
is to listen to what the
other actors are saying.

20:48.256 --> 20:50.289
Are you listening to me?

20:50.291 --> 20:52.224
I'm gonna need you to brush
up on your drama skills.

20:52.226 --> 20:55.194
Because you're gonna have to
get better... a lot better...

20:55.196 --> 20:56.495
Fast.

20:56.497 --> 20:58.631
We're all booked for a
one-time-only performance

20:58.633 --> 21:00.499
of "you do whatever the hell I say."

21:00.501 --> 21:02.201
I'm the lead,

21:02.203 --> 21:03.636
you and your little adopted
boy here are supporting.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.905
Now, if you kill it...

21:05.907 --> 21:08.641
We're all gonna get Tonys.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.743
Now, you want a Tony, don't you?

21:12.712 --> 21:14.246
Your plan won't work.

21:14.248 --> 21:16.215
I won't let you take my children.

21:16.217 --> 21:18.484
Well, it's not gonna work
with one creepy old dude,

21:18.486 --> 21:20.653
so guess what... We're
bringing the whole clan.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.555
So sit down.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.661
You told him not to touch my daughter.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.529
What?

21:30.531 --> 21:32.464
Your brother.

21:32.466 --> 21:35.367
Why did you tell him
not to touch my daughter?

21:35.369 --> 21:38.370
Your daughter's gonna be fine.

21:38.372 --> 21:41.407
He harms her...

21:41.409 --> 21:43.342
I'll kill you with my bare hands.

21:44.311 --> 21:46.545
<i>You're gonna kill him
with your big mouth first.</i>

21:48.248 --> 21:49.748
- What's your name, again?
- Scott.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.250
Scott, do me a favor.

21:51.252 --> 21:52.685
Tell your dad to sit down and shut up.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.421
Dad...

21:55.423 --> 21:56.755
Sit down.

22:08.502 --> 22:09.668
Getting better already.

22:16.409 --> 22:17.977
You're not inhaling.

22:17.979 --> 22:20.346
I'm not a smoker.

22:21.982 --> 22:23.282
You seem like a nice girl.

22:23.284 --> 22:25.484
<i>How would you know?</i>

22:25.486 --> 22:27.519
I could be a terrible person.

22:27.521 --> 22:29.321
I pick up on things.

22:29.323 --> 22:30.589
Oh, yeah?

22:30.591 --> 22:33.993
What other kinds of
things do you pick up on?

22:33.995 --> 22:36.395
Underage girls?

22:38.265 --> 22:40.299
That would be despicable.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.804
You should pick that up.

22:47.307 --> 22:48.774
It's my dad.

22:48.776 --> 22:50.676
I don't want to talk to him.

22:50.678 --> 22:52.311
Not right now, at least.

22:52.313 --> 22:53.746
You have a problem with him.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.547
I'm a teenager.

22:55.549 --> 22:57.750
It's something deeper than that...

22:57.752 --> 23:00.286
Something that really hurts.

23:03.323 --> 23:06.325
I saw you floating in the pool.

23:06.327 --> 23:08.661
It was like you were bleeding,

23:08.663 --> 23:10.562
like you were hurting inside.

23:10.564 --> 23:13.365
I really think that you should talk to him.

23:13.367 --> 23:14.867
It'll make you feel better.

23:18.338 --> 23:22.841
Are you some kind of...
Traveling preacher or something?

23:22.843 --> 23:24.443
You're wearing that suit.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.478
You... you look like a Bible salesman.

23:28.449 --> 23:31.050
I don't sell bibles.

23:31.052 --> 23:33.619
But I think I see the truth.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.555
I see a lot of things.

23:36.557 --> 23:37.723
Like what?

23:37.725 --> 23:40.659
I see a girl hiding from her father.

23:46.433 --> 23:51.637
Something... Happened to me and my family.

23:54.808 --> 23:58.677
My dad keeps lying to me about it.

23:58.679 --> 24:01.647
I don't know how to talk to him.

24:06.419 --> 24:08.687
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

24:08.689 --> 24:12.391
Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers.

24:16.596 --> 24:18.397
My name is Kate.

24:18.399 --> 24:20.499
Oh, see? Now you've gone
and ruined the whole thing.

24:21.736 --> 24:23.669
Richard.

24:27.407 --> 24:28.874
You think he killed her.

24:30.610 --> 24:31.710
Excuse me?

24:31.712 --> 24:33.645
Well, whoever she was...

24:33.647 --> 24:35.381
She never had migraines.

24:36.116 --> 24:37.850
Oh, my God.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.119
Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to...

24:40.121 --> 24:42.855
I don't know what kind of
tricks you're playing on me.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.861
It's judgment.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.729
What's that?

24:50.731 --> 24:53.132
You're judgment.

24:53.134 --> 24:56.602
You're here to bring
his judgment down on me.

24:56.604 --> 24:58.637
This isn't in the script, old man.

24:58.639 --> 25:00.873
My children have paid
the price for my actions.

25:00.875 --> 25:04.143
I'm the one that deserves this, not them.

25:04.145 --> 25:05.677
I'll come with you willingly.

25:05.679 --> 25:08.147
Please don't make them
suffer for what I've done.

25:08.149 --> 25:10.549
Don't go getting soft on me, old man.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.451
Now, we still have a performance to put on.

25:12.453 --> 25:13.652
Keep the energy up.

25:15.155 --> 25:16.622
Kate, run!

25:17.591 --> 25:19.458
Was it something I said?

25:38.445 --> 25:41.113
Didn't expect this my third day on the job.

25:44.785 --> 25:47.586
Way I see it, you're two days late.

25:54.795 --> 25:57.530
Should we call for backup?

25:57.532 --> 25:59.298
You want to tell this girl's parents

25:59.300 --> 26:00.666
you were waiting for backup?

27:27.320 --> 27:29.288
Aah! Oh!

27:45.239 --> 27:47.273
Keep the change.

28:30.184 --> 28:31.350
- Turn it down.
- Whoa!

28:32.753 --> 28:35.354
You got something that
doesn't belong to you.

28:37.257 --> 28:41.227
You got to get it back
to its rightful owner.

28:42.396 --> 28:43.562
You're dead.

28:46.299 --> 28:48.167
Just know this, friend...

28:48.169 --> 28:52.104
The path is stained with tears of blood.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.106
<i>Lagrimas de Sangre.</i>

28:54.108 --> 28:56.075
<i>Lagrimas!</i>

28:56.077 --> 28:57.576
<i>Lagrimas!</i>

29:23.270 --> 29:25.237
<i>Lagrimas.</i>

29:27.808 --> 29:30.142
"Lagrimas."

29:41.421 --> 29:43.222
Get down! Everybody down!

29:49.563 --> 29:52.598
Clear out! Let's go! Let's
go! Let's go! Let's go!

29:52.600 --> 29:54.633
Hold your fire!

30:02.442 --> 30:05.144
Get 'em back! Get 'em back!

30:05.146 --> 30:06.445
That's the ex-wife, which means

30:06.447 --> 30:07.646
those son of a bitch
brothers ain't far away.

30:07.648 --> 30:09.348
What happened here?

30:09.350 --> 30:11.250
I've only interviewed
a few witnesses so far,

30:11.252 --> 30:12.551
but from what I can tell,

30:12.553 --> 30:14.520
one of my men spotted him at the counter.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.455
He was about to make the arrest.

30:16.457 --> 30:18.457
That's when that tall
drink of water showed up

30:18.459 --> 30:19.658
with her hand cannon.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.461
What the hell are you gonna do?

30:22.463 --> 30:24.196
I'm just gonna talk to her.

30:24.198 --> 30:26.332
Y'all go on! Get out of here!

30:28.469 --> 30:29.869
I want keys to a vehicle!

30:29.871 --> 30:31.203
I'm done asking!

30:31.205 --> 30:32.638
Y'all better clear out,

30:32.640 --> 30:35.141
or I'm gonna unload my gun
in the back of his fat head!

30:35.143 --> 30:36.609
Don't do this, Vanessa.

30:36.611 --> 30:38.611
You don't really expect
to drive out of here.

30:38.613 --> 30:40.279
I'm gonna do what I got to do.

30:40.281 --> 30:41.580
For who?

30:41.582 --> 30:43.083
For Seth?

30:43.084 --> 30:45.051
Isn't he the one who
left you holding the bag?

30:48.021 --> 30:49.689
What the hell is that?

30:49.691 --> 30:52.024
Richie's been doing this to
girls up and down the state.

30:52.026 --> 30:54.360
Now, I got to assume you're
accessory to bank robbery,

30:54.362 --> 30:56.195
but you want to be a party to that?

30:56.197 --> 30:58.064
Seth doesn't have anything to do with that.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.165
Not his choice.

30:59.167 --> 31:01.033
Richie's not right in the head.

31:01.035 --> 31:02.435
Yeah? What about it?

31:02.437 --> 31:04.303
At some point, someone's
gonna really piss him off,

31:04.305 --> 31:07.006
and he's gonna go really, really bad.

31:07.008 --> 31:08.507
You want that to be Seth?

31:09.443 --> 31:12.244
Richie's got a sick soul.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.380
And I need to put him away.

31:14.382 --> 31:16.315
Help me do that.

31:19.186 --> 31:20.252
Go.

31:24.324 --> 31:26.125
Drove off in a Camaro.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.295
I smashed it up.

31:29.297 --> 31:31.163
They're staying at a motel nearby.

31:31.165 --> 31:33.032
There's a lot of those around here.

31:33.034 --> 31:35.301
That's all I know.

31:37.404 --> 31:41.407
You find Seth, and you get
him away from that freak.

31:41.409 --> 31:44.143
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.347
Time's up, princess.

31:52.386 --> 31:55.121
Okay, ramblers, let's get ramblin'.

31:55.123 --> 31:58.057
Now, we can't all go marching
past the lobby all at once.

31:58.059 --> 32:00.493
It's gonna be a very
guilty-looking parade.

32:00.495 --> 32:02.261
So here's how we're gonna do it.

32:02.263 --> 32:03.429
You're gonna go first... Alone.

32:03.431 --> 32:05.131
You're gonna get into the motor home,

32:05.133 --> 32:06.232
you're gonna start her up,

32:06.234 --> 32:07.500
you're gonna bring her around front,

32:07.502 --> 32:09.068
and then you're gonna wait.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.403
Five minutes after that,

32:10.405 --> 32:13.139
Richie and boy wonder are
gonna go down with our bags.

32:13.141 --> 32:16.108
Five minutes after that, me
and Miley are gonna go down.

32:16.110 --> 32:18.577
Everyone should have their hero switch

32:18.579 --> 32:20.179
in the "off" position.

32:20.181 --> 32:21.414
I make the plan.

32:21.416 --> 32:23.582
<i>Everybody executes it, or I execute you.</i>

32:25.285 --> 32:26.786
Simple as "Sesame Street."

32:40.067 --> 32:41.400
Hold your damn horses!

32:41.402 --> 32:43.135
Texas Ranger. Need to have a word with you.

32:43.137 --> 32:44.603
What do you want?

32:44.605 --> 32:46.405
I'm doing a hotel/motel search
for a couple of fugitives.

32:46.407 --> 32:48.107
Have you seen either of these men?

32:48.109 --> 32:49.341
I haven't seen anybody.

32:49.343 --> 32:52.178
You got to look at the picture.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.185
Is there a reward?

33:06.426 --> 33:08.427
If I'm going first,

33:08.429 --> 33:10.463
I want to talk to my kids before I leave.

33:10.465 --> 33:12.865
That's a lovely sentiment.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.300
No dice.

33:14.302 --> 33:16.202
We'll have a greater chance of success

33:16.204 --> 33:18.437
if they're calm and focused.

33:20.174 --> 33:21.240
All right. One minute.

33:21.242 --> 33:22.641
One.

33:23.844 --> 33:25.511
We should move the RV to the back.

33:26.847 --> 33:28.280
Why would we do that?

33:28.282 --> 33:29.548
Something's telling me that we need to.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.183
Something's telling you?

33:31.185 --> 33:32.585
I'm telling you it's fine.

33:32.587 --> 33:34.253
You haven't listened to a word
I've been saying, have you?

33:34.255 --> 33:36.155
No, Richard. I haven't.

33:36.157 --> 33:37.857
Because actions speak louder than words.

33:37.859 --> 33:39.558
Now, would you like to go back to our room

33:39.560 --> 33:41.127
and review those actions?

33:42.295 --> 33:44.196
I've tuned in to something.

33:44.198 --> 33:47.166
And it is showing me the way.

33:47.168 --> 33:50.402
I am back, which means we are back.

33:52.673 --> 33:54.874
Tell him to move the RV to the back.

33:54.876 --> 33:56.542
RV stays.

33:56.544 --> 33:59.211
There's only one captain on
this ship, and it ain't you.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.610
Girl's gonna be all right.

34:42.188 --> 34:43.556
Medics looked her over real good.

34:43.558 --> 34:46.192
Mom and dad's on the way.

34:48.428 --> 34:52.297
World's a better place without
those two mongrels in it.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.366
I'm sorry, Earl.

34:54.368 --> 34:56.235
For what?

34:56.237 --> 34:58.204
Who the hell am I kidding?

34:58.206 --> 34:59.805
I ain't cut out for this.

35:00.941 --> 35:03.342
Can't even stand the sight of blood.

35:04.444 --> 35:05.611
Then go.

35:07.447 --> 35:08.681
What do you mean?

35:08.683 --> 35:10.583
Go. Leave.

35:10.585 --> 35:13.452
Nobody's begging you to be a ranger.

35:13.454 --> 35:15.354
But you ain't gonna quit.

35:15.356 --> 35:17.256
Why?

35:17.258 --> 35:19.558
'Cause you got the soul of a ranger.

35:19.560 --> 35:23.362
You know that you're
part of something bigger.

35:23.364 --> 35:25.364
You're part of the last line of defense

35:25.366 --> 35:27.566
between chaos and order.

35:28.668 --> 35:33.672
And that soul is what made you
not want to wait for backup.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.441
That's the same soul

35:35.443 --> 35:38.377
that made you want to kick in that door.

35:38.379 --> 35:41.480
And I hate to tell you, kid, but...

35:41.482 --> 35:44.617
It's also what makes you
hate the sight of blood.

35:50.590 --> 35:52.491
I'm still sorry.

35:52.493 --> 35:55.494
Don't say that to me
again, or I'll shoot you.

36:10.610 --> 36:13.279
I know you're disgusted with me right now.

36:13.281 --> 36:15.714
I know this is more than you bargained for

36:15.716 --> 36:17.750
when we started on this road.

36:17.752 --> 36:19.385
But it is what it is.

36:19.387 --> 36:21.020
What'd you mean by all the judgment stuff?

36:21.022 --> 36:22.521
It was nothing.

36:22.523 --> 36:24.456
Wait... What judgment stuff?

36:24.458 --> 36:26.625
He was talking to one of them
like this was supposed to happen...

36:26.627 --> 36:28.427
Like he deserved it or something.

36:28.429 --> 36:31.063
I was trying to distract him.

36:31.065 --> 36:32.665
Listen very closely.

36:32.667 --> 36:37.469
When I'm not here, you
do exactly what they say.

36:37.471 --> 36:39.772
You follow every instruction to the letter.

36:39.774 --> 36:41.774
Dad, you trust these freaks?

36:41.776 --> 36:44.410
No, but I trust the fact that
they want to get to Mexico,

36:44.412 --> 36:46.445
and they can't do that
without all three of us alive.

36:46.447 --> 36:49.348
We're gonna survive this
'cause we're a family.

36:49.350 --> 36:50.683
We are minus one.

36:50.685 --> 36:52.751
And God knows I miss
her. I miss her deeply.

36:52.753 --> 36:53.652
But...

36:53.654 --> 36:54.787
Do you, daddy?

36:54.789 --> 36:56.322
Kate, what the hell?

36:56.324 --> 36:58.657
Okay. Family meeting's adjourned.

36:58.659 --> 37:00.326
Let's go, pops.

37:02.495 --> 37:04.663
They're gone, sir. And the bags are gone.

37:04.665 --> 37:06.832
No sign of the bearer bonds.

37:06.834 --> 37:08.567
They left behind the teller, too.

37:08.569 --> 37:09.868
Carved her up like a game hen.

37:09.870 --> 37:11.737
Call some
locals to secure the area.

37:11.739 --> 37:13.472
I'm on my way.

37:13.474 --> 37:16.375
And, Gonzalez, don't think
this absolves you of anything.

37:16.377 --> 37:18.544
Excuse me, sir.

37:18.546 --> 37:20.346
Do I know you?

37:20.348 --> 37:21.747
Have you seen these men?

37:26.419 --> 37:28.821
Can't say that I have.

37:28.823 --> 37:31.490
Have a blessed day.

38:03.022 --> 38:05.491
All right. Getting close.

38:09.729 --> 38:11.764
You like Bruce Lee?

38:11.766 --> 38:12.831
Huh?

38:12.833 --> 38:16.468
Bruce Lee... Do you like him?

38:16.470 --> 38:18.103
Yeah.

38:18.105 --> 38:20.005
So do I.

38:20.007 --> 38:23.742
You seen any of his early stuff?

38:23.744 --> 38:24.977
Mm... Yeah.

38:24.979 --> 38:28.046
Can you understand all the
stuff that they're saying?

38:28.048 --> 38:31.183
Um, k-kind of. Not... not much.

38:33.754 --> 38:36.155
<i>You kind of look like Bruce Lee.</i>

38:36.157 --> 38:38.090
Why? 'Cause I'm Asian?

38:40.026 --> 38:42.628
No, because you look like Bruce Lee.

38:44.431 --> 38:47.032
Just paid you a compliment.

38:47.034 --> 38:50.936
All kinds of strangeness
going on in this motel today.

38:50.938 --> 38:52.171
Like what?

38:52.173 --> 38:55.073
I'm not supposed to talk about the guests.

38:55.075 --> 38:56.809
It's okay, ma'am. I'm a ranger.

38:56.811 --> 38:58.911
Do I look like some kind of idiot to you?

38:58.913 --> 39:01.780
I see the star. I know what you are, son.

39:01.782 --> 39:04.516
Ma'am... That's the
problem with you people...

39:04.518 --> 39:06.985
Think you can treat everybody
like they're the help.

39:08.087 --> 39:10.989
Okay, boys. Showtime.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.211
Me first? You first?

39:32.213 --> 39:34.580
You got something you want to say to me?

39:35.982 --> 39:37.916
I'm not gonna ask you twice.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.218
I don't have anything to say to you.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.019
You got nothing to say, huh?

39:41.021 --> 39:44.089
That's funny. I could have sworn
you gave me an "f. u." Look.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.959
You want to say "f. u.," Scott?

39:48.027 --> 39:49.127
No.

39:49.129 --> 39:51.830
Hmm. My mistake.

39:51.832 --> 39:53.932
Maybe it wasn't an "f. u." Look.

39:53.934 --> 39:56.869
Maybe it was an "I'm
gonna make a move" look.

39:56.871 --> 39:58.036
Is that right?

39:58.038 --> 40:00.906
You ready to make a move, Scott?

40:00.908 --> 40:03.242
That was a question, not a statement.

40:03.244 --> 40:04.943
And I want an answer.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.979
How could I?

40:06.981 --> 40:08.247
You have a gun.

40:08.249 --> 40:10.115
That's right.

40:10.117 --> 40:11.583
I got a gun.

40:11.585 --> 40:14.586
And I know how to use it.

40:14.588 --> 40:17.055
Do you know how to use a gun, Scott?

40:17.057 --> 40:18.257
No.

40:18.259 --> 40:20.859
Ah, simplicity in itself.

40:20.861 --> 40:22.995
You see, you point at what you want to die.

40:22.997 --> 40:25.297
You pull the little trigger.

40:25.299 --> 40:27.232
Little bullet comes out here.

40:27.234 --> 40:29.001
Little bullet hits you right there.

40:29.003 --> 40:31.236
Then you don't look like Bruce Lee anymore.

40:37.645 --> 40:38.944
I got it.

40:42.882 --> 40:44.616
I just need to know if you've
seen either of these two men.

40:44.618 --> 40:46.118
So, now you want my help?

40:46.120 --> 40:47.085
Ma'am. Please.

40:48.289 --> 40:49.588
I seen that one.

40:49.590 --> 40:52.124
Handsome devil. Room 106.

40:52.126 --> 40:53.292
Do you know where he and his brother went?

40:53.294 --> 40:54.560
Brother?

40:54.562 --> 40:56.094
Do you know where he went?

40:56.096 --> 40:58.630
Mm. Heard him up in another room.

40:58.632 --> 40:59.932
Which room?

40:59.934 --> 41:01.266
Upstairs... 207.

41:02.302 --> 41:04.670
You're welcome.

41:24.123 --> 41:27.059
Start 'er up.

41:29.129 --> 41:31.730
You know, that daughter of
yours is a real sweet girl.

41:31.732 --> 41:34.032
We had a nice long talk.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.233
Sounds like the two of you

41:35.235 --> 41:36.702
have a few things you need to work out.

41:36.704 --> 41:38.604
Keep your hands off my daughter.

41:38.606 --> 41:40.939
I just want to remind you
that she's still up there.

41:40.941 --> 41:44.076
So if you try anything...
Anything at all...

41:44.078 --> 41:46.211
I'll be having Katey-kakes for dessert.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.780
How do you know I call her that?

41:51.050 --> 41:52.250
They know that we're here.

41:52.252 --> 41:54.052
Who knows?

41:54.054 --> 41:56.088
The cops. They're around. I
can practically smell them.

41:56.090 --> 41:57.656
Okay, change of plans.

41:57.658 --> 42:00.158
Take this big bastard
around the back... now!

42:00.160 --> 42:03.996
Ever had the pleasure of
working with a ranger, J.P.?

42:03.998 --> 42:05.130
Can't say that I have.

42:05.132 --> 42:06.965
Bunch of
first-class a-holes.

42:06.967 --> 42:09.668
Act like God almighty put
them in charge of the universe.

42:10.703 --> 42:12.070
How you doing there, sir?

42:12.072 --> 42:14.072
One of the geckos might still be here.

42:14.074 --> 42:15.240
I'm gonna go around this far stairwell.

42:15.242 --> 42:16.375
You guys come around this other side.

42:16.377 --> 42:17.709
We'll meet in the middle.

42:17.711 --> 42:19.778
Whatever you say, sir.

42:21.981 --> 42:23.649
Okay, it's time.

42:24.717 --> 42:26.184
You ready?

42:27.320 --> 42:30.989
Listen, um...

42:30.991 --> 42:33.125
Did my brother...

42:33.127 --> 42:34.259
Do anything to you?

42:35.261 --> 42:36.395
He scared me.

42:36.397 --> 42:39.131
You're not the only one.

42:41.300 --> 42:42.801
Look at me.

42:42.803 --> 42:44.202
Remember what I told you.

42:44.204 --> 42:46.271
You do what I tell you when I tell you,

42:46.273 --> 42:48.340
and you'll get out of this
without any bumps or scrapes.

42:48.342 --> 42:49.775
Okay?

43:02.021 --> 43:03.255
Eyes find eyes.

43:23.109 --> 43:24.076
Come on.

43:28.715 --> 43:30.782
All right, here goes nothing.

43:44.898 --> 43:46.565
Hey!

44:22.836 --> 44:24.003
You having fun, brother?

44:24.005 --> 44:25.337
Jesus Christ, Richie.

44:25.339 --> 44:27.006
You know, a little "hey, it's me"

44:27.008 --> 44:29.608
before you fling the friggin' door open

44:29.610 --> 44:31.710
would go a long way in keeping you alive.

44:31.712 --> 44:33.345
I moved the RV around back.

44:33.347 --> 44:34.613
- You what?!
- I told you we had to.

44:34.615 --> 44:35.881
Look, we got to get out of here

44:35.883 --> 44:37.316
before ranger Ricardo makes his way in.

44:37.318 --> 44:40.653
Almost there. Now what are you gonna do?

44:40.655 --> 44:42.421
Huh?

44:43.823 --> 44:45.824
You're too scared to follow through?

45:06.980 --> 45:08.981
Where's the knife?

45:12.319 --> 45:13.819
Come on!

45:13.821 --> 45:16.422
You call yourself a ranger?

45:33.106 --> 45:34.973
Freeze!

45:40.414 --> 45:41.513
Go! Go!

46:25.158 --> 46:27.092
Doesn't that just beat all?

46:27.094 --> 46:29.128
Talked to your ex. She
gave you up real quick.

46:29.130 --> 46:31.130
You geckos sure have a
knack for pissing people off.

46:31.132 --> 46:32.398
Keep talking.

46:33.133 --> 46:34.800
Oh, we're gonna do this?

46:54.421 --> 46:55.821
Go sit down.

46:58.024 --> 46:59.425
Drive.

47:04.497 --> 47:06.799
Did I call it, or did I call it?

47:07.902 --> 47:09.568
If I didn't move this beast...

47:09.570 --> 47:11.537
All right, already. You're a genius.

47:11.539 --> 47:12.971
Hey.

47:12.973 --> 47:14.973
Are we back, brother?

47:16.509 --> 47:19.011
Yeah. Yeah, we're back.

47:24.951 --> 47:26.785
All right, pops.

47:26.787 --> 47:29.455
You're gonna make a left right up here.

47:33.793 --> 47:36.995
I didn't mean to scare
you at the pool earlier.

47:36.997 --> 47:38.597
I was telling you the truth.

47:40.133 --> 47:42.801
I don't remember what you said.

47:42.803 --> 47:43.902
And I don't care.

47:43.904 --> 47:45.204
Yes, you do.

47:45.206 --> 47:49.541
Sorry your world is upside down.

47:49.543 --> 47:50.876
I don't know, but I feel like

47:50.878 --> 47:52.845
all this is happening for a reason.

47:52.847 --> 47:55.147
Can...

47:55.149 --> 47:57.115
Can you really see things?

48:00.520 --> 48:02.554
Only when I look.

48:03.305 --> 48:09.696
