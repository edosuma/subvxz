00:04.638 --> 00:05.606
LAST TIME ON
"GOOD LUCK CHARLIE"...

00:05.639 --> 00:08.176
Bob:
WE'RE GOING ON
A FAMILY VACATION!

00:08.209 --> 00:12.446
YOU WILL COME FACE TO FACE
WITH THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.548
HEY, HONEY, GUESS WHAT?

00:14.582 --> 00:18.252
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY MARRIED.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GRAB
SOME LUNCH?

00:18.286 --> 00:21.189
- I HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET.
- ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS

00:21.222 --> 00:24.192
- KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
- THEY'RE OPEN.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.461
THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE
THAT THIS IS A BUNCH OF--

00:27.495 --> 00:29.397
WHOA!

00:29.430 --> 00:30.631
I'M SORRY.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.801
TEDDY.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.504
SPENCER?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.239
HI.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.475
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:41.509 --> 00:44.112
WELL, ACTUALLY I CAME
HERE TO SEE YOU.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.514
OH NO.
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.816
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT YOU

00:48.849 --> 00:50.618
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO SAY.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.586
JUST PLEASE DON'T.
IT CAN'T BE YOU.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.522
- WHAT CAN'T BE ME?
- IT!

00:54.555 --> 00:56.390
HOW MUCH
CLEARER CAN I BE?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.492
- WILL YOU
AT LEAST LISTEN TO ME?
- I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.494
- I'M REALLY BUSY BUSY BUSY.
- OKAY, BUT, TEDDY--

01:00.528 --> 01:02.430

01:07.435 --> 01:08.636
( rock music playing )

01:08.669 --> 01:10.371
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:10.404 --> 01:12.173
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:12.206 --> 01:14.508
* "HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE?" *

01:14.542 --> 01:16.510
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:16.544 --> 01:18.512
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

01:18.546 --> 01:20.381
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:21.915 --> 01:24.885
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:24.918 --> 01:28.122
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:28.156 --> 01:31.559
* HANG IN THERE, BABY,
THINGS ARE CRAZY *

01:31.592 --> 01:34.595
* BUT I KNOW

01:34.628 --> 01:36.464
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:36.497 --> 01:38.132
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

01:38.166 --> 01:40.901

01:43.404 --> 01:46.607
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

01:46.640 --> 01:50.544
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

01:51.945 --> 01:54.515
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.697
HI, HONEY.
YOUR FAVORITE DINNER.AND MADE

02:09.730 --> 02:12.333
I AM SO LUCKY TO BE
MARRIED TO YOU.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.536
AS MY MOM
ALWAYS SAYS TO MY DAD,

02:15.569 --> 02:17.405
YES, YOU ARE.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.940
HI, HONEY.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.409
HOW'S MY
BEAUTIFUL WIFE TODAY?

02:21.442 --> 02:23.511
WAIT, BUT--

02:23.544 --> 02:25.613
- BUT I THOUGHT--
- HI, HONEY.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.583
OH, YOU MADE BRANDON'S
FAVORITE DINNER.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.586
WAIT A MINUTE.
AM I MARRIED TO YOU

02:32.620 --> 02:34.222
OR YOU OR YOU?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.290
All: YES.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.959
YOU COULDN'T DECIDE WHICH ONE
OF US WAS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.662
- SO YOU MARRIED ALL OF US.
- BUT THAT'S CRAZY.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.464
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S CRAZY--

02:43.497 --> 02:45.766
IT'S 10 YEARS LATER AND I
HAVEN'T GROWN AT ALL.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.978
IVY, I'M UP HERE AT
THE SKI LODGE AND-AND I MET

02:58.011 --> 03:00.448
THIS PSYCHIC WHO SAID
I'D MEET THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.550
AND SO I MET THE GUY
BUT THEN I MET ANOTHER GUY,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.552
AND THEN YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHO SHOWED UP.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.521
AND SO THAT MAKES THREE GUYS
AND-AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.459
OH SORRY.
THIS IS TEDDY.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.466
WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP,
MIND IF I GO FIRST?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.434
YOU'RE KINDA SLOW.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.303
EXCUSE ME?

03:22.336 --> 03:25.773
I'VE SEEN YOU BOARD.
AND I'VE ALSO SEEN
MY GRANDMA BOARD.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.377
KIND OF THE SAME THING.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.013
- BETTER THAN YOU.
- OH YEAH?!

03:33.046 --> 03:35.383
CARE TO PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS?

03:35.416 --> 03:39.287
NOPE!
LAST TIME I DID THAT,
A QUARTER FROZE TO MY LIP.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.391
I MEAN DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE A BET?

03:43.424 --> 03:46.260
100 BUCKS SAYS I BEAT YOU
TO THE BOTTOM.

03:46.294 --> 03:49.330
OH, IT IS ON.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.831
( screaming )

03:54.502 --> 03:57.771
THE ONLY REASON YOU WON
IS BECAUSE I HIT A WICKED
PATCH OF ICE.

03:57.805 --> 04:02.343
THEN I GUESS YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM
MAKING IT DOUBLE OR NOTHING.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.545
BRING IT.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.847
( screaming )

04:17.325 --> 04:20.828
HEY, LOOK WHAT
CHARLIE GOT.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.764
A PRESENT FROM THAT LITTLE
TODDLER SHE HAS A CRUSH ON.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.401
- THAT'S NICE.
- I GUESS SOME MEN KNOW
HOW TO TREAT THEIR WOMEN.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.472
- YOU SEEN MY LUGGAGE?
- YES, I HAVE.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.643
- DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHERE IT IS?
- SURE.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.645
IT'S IN YOUR ROOM--

04:37.678 --> 04:40.481
YOUR NEW ROOM.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.317
WHY DO I HAVE A NEW ROOM?

04:43.351 --> 04:45.653
WELL, BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE NOT LEGALLY MARRIED.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.855
AND SINCE IT WOULD
APPARENTLY INCONVENIENCE YOU

04:47.888 --> 04:50.858
TO MARRY ME AGAIN,
YOU'LL BE LODGING ELSEWHERE.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.461
- OH COME ON!
- MM-HMM.

04:53.494 --> 04:57.365
AS A SINGLE WOMAN,
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE HAVING
A STRANGE MAN IN MY ROOM.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.501
- AMY DUNCAN,
YOU'RE A PIECE OF WORK.
- AH AH!

05:00.534 --> 05:03.604
AMY BLANKENHOOPER.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.073
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO YOUR MAIDEN NAME?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.342
YES, I AM.
MM-HMM.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.345
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'VE ALWAYS PREFERRED
BLANKENHOOPER.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.481
YEAH?
WHAT IS IT YOU LIKE
MOST ABOUT IT?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.516
THAT PEOPLE LAUGH SO HARD
WHEN THEY SAY IT

05:15.549 --> 05:17.317
OR JUST THAT THEY CAN'T
SPELL IT?

05:18.619 --> 05:20.320
GET OUT, BOB.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.467
HEY, T!

05:33.501 --> 05:35.636
OH, IVY, I'M SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.107
YOU CAN LOWER
YOUR ARMS NOW.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.810
DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD
IF I COULD?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.113
WHY DO YOU HAVE
SO MANY LAYERS ON?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.816
IVY DOESN'T DO COLD.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.120
SO WHAT'S
THE BIG EMERGENCY?

05:53.153 --> 05:55.556
WELL, I MET
THIS PSYCHIC.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.691
OH, SO YOU DID SAY PSYCHIC.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.860
I THOUGHT WE WERE
IN A BAD CELL ZONE.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.697
ANYWAY, SHE SAID I'D COME
FACE TO FACE WITH THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE ON THIS TRIP,

06:03.731 --> 06:07.535
AND SO FAR I'VE MET BRANDON,
JUSTIN AND...

06:07.568 --> 06:09.670
- SPENCER.
- SPENCER?

06:09.703 --> 06:12.506
THE TWO-TIMING DOG
THAT CHEATED ON YOU?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.708
- YEP, THAT'S THE ONE.
- NO!

06:14.742 --> 06:16.444
THAT'S NOT THE ONE.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.946
I MEAN, SO WHO ARE
THESE OTHER BOYS?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.948
OH, THERE-- THERE'S ONE
RIGHT NOW.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.816
THAT'S JUSTIN.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.419
OH, HE'S CUTE!
SO WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT HIM?

06:25.453 --> 06:27.555
THAT HE'S CUTE.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.690
WELL, I'VE ONLY HAD
ONE DAY.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.425
ALL I NEED
IS ONE MINUTE.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.561
YO, JUSTIN!

06:33.594 --> 06:36.430
TEDDY, HI.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.433
HI, JUSTIN.
THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND IVY.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.969
HOW YOU DOING, JUSTIN.
YOU A SKIER?

06:42.002 --> 06:44.538
- YEAH, I SURE AM.
- OH GREAT.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.973
ONE OTHER THING.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.476
- DOES YOUR FAMILY
HAVE MONEY?
- IVY!

06:48.509 --> 06:50.210
SORRY.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.447
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T
CATCH YOUR ANSWER.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.450
THAT'S 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
THROW IT YET.
( giggling )

06:56.484 --> 06:58.486
( snorting )

07:05.493 --> 07:07.928
- P.J.!
- ( unison ) I NEED
TO BORROW SOME MONEY!

07:07.961 --> 07:09.463
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

07:09.497 --> 07:11.599
I NEED TO BORROW
SOME MONEY!
STOP THAT!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.001
- ALL RIGHT, ME FIRST.
- OKAY.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.637
I LOST A BET
AND I NEED $200.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.674
I NEED $300.
DID YOU KNOW HOTELS
CHARGE FOR ROOM SERVICE?

07:20.708 --> 07:23.744
SURE, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.
DID YOU KNOW I'M A TERRIBLE
SNOWBOARDER?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.013
SURE, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.216
- WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE
TALKED EARLIER.
- YEAH.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.619
MAN, WHERE ARE WE
GONNA FIND $500?

07:31.652 --> 07:34.588
ATTENTION, GUESTS,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE

07:34.622 --> 07:37.525
TO SIGN UP FOR
THE ICE-DANCING CONTEST.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.494
GRAND PRIZE $500.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.263
THAT WAS CONVENIENT.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.033
JUST ONE PROBLEM--
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
TO ICE DANCE.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.503
REMEMBER THIS IS
AN AMATEUR CONTEST.

07:49.537 --> 07:53.473
YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO ICE DANCE.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.552
( laughs )

08:06.754 --> 08:09.056
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.
HI, BOB. DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.058
- WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?
- SOME GUY I MET.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.527
AH.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

08:13.561 --> 08:16.296
WELL, IT'S NOT DUNCAN,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.532
YEP, BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.669
YOU KNOW TWO CAN
PLAY AT THIS GAME.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.707
( masculine voice )
HIYA, DOLL.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.580
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
THIS GAME.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.618
SO YOU WANT TO BE A CHEF
AND A SWIMSUIT MODEL.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.554
THAT'S A GOOD COMBINATION.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.656
HOW DO WE KNOW
HE'S QUALIFIED?

08:42.690 --> 08:45.559
CAN YOU COOK US
SOMETHING?

08:45.593 --> 08:48.562
- WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF?
- IVY!

08:48.596 --> 08:50.564
SHE'S JUST KIDDING.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.600
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.604
( phone rings )

08:57.605 --> 08:58.739
HI, MOMMY.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.710
I'M IN THE LOBBY
WITH SOME GIRLS.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.145
NO, THEY'RE NOT
PRETTIER THAN YOU.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.885
OKAY, 0 FOR 2.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.988
SO IF IT'S NOT BRANDON
AND IT'S NOT JUSTIN,

09:15.022 --> 09:17.324
- THEN THAT MEANS--
- NO, DON'T SAY SPENCER!

09:17.357 --> 09:21.128
IT CANNOT BE SPENCER.
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE SPENCER!

09:21.161 --> 09:24.131
I WAS GONNA SAY
THAT MEANS I CAME ALL
THE WAY UP HERE FOR NOTHING,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.634
BUT YEAH,
LET'S KEEP IT ON YOU.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.144
SO THAT'S
ICE DANCING, HUH?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.680
IT LOOKED HARD!

09:39.713 --> 09:42.883
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK
TO THE LOBBY AND SEE IF
THERE'S ANOTHER $500 CONTEST.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.753
COME ON, WE CAN DO THIS.
WE JUST GOTTA WORK OUT
A ROUTINE.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.623
UM, OKAY, PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE TEAPOT POSITION
LIKE THEY DID IN THE VIDEO.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.358
LIKE THIS?

09:51.391 --> 09:53.961
( squeals, laughs )

09:53.994 --> 09:57.030
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
- NOTHING. I'M TICKLISH.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.832
WELL, DON'T BE!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.869
- LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
- OKAY.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.374
- STOP THAT!
- I CAN'T HELP IT!

10:07.407 --> 10:09.943
GABE, COME ON.
IF WE'RE GONNA DO
THIS THING,

10:09.977 --> 10:12.045
WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER.
WE HAVE TO WORK HARDER

10:12.079 --> 10:13.847
THAN WE'VE EVER WORKED
IN OUR LIVES.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.717
WE HAVE TO PUSH OURSELVES
TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT

10:16.750 --> 10:18.952
AND BEYOND.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.088
THE CONTEST IS AT 4:00.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.024
I WON'T KID YOU.
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH
HOUR AND A HALF.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.433
WHAT AN AWESOME VIEW.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.703
I TOTALLY AGREE.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.639
OH NO.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.852
SPENCER, ARE YOU
FOLLOWING ME?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.821
WELL, KINDA, YEAH.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.824
UM, THERE'S SOMETHING I REALLY
NEED TO TELL YOU FACE TO FACE.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.892
NO NO, DON'T SAY
FACE TO FACE.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.228
- WHY NOT?
- LOOK, IT'S COMPLICATED.

11:01.261 --> 11:05.065
CAN WE JUST PLEASE SIT HERE
QUIETLY UNTIL THE RIDE'S OVER?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.867
JUST NO MORE TALKING.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.239
( creaks )

11:12.272 --> 11:14.875
THE SKI LIFT STOPPED.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.244
( singsong )
I HEAR TALKING.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.016
ONE AND TWO
AND THREE AND FOUR.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.854
AND ARMS ARMS,
HANDS HANDS.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.257
AND SPIN,
TWO THREE FOUR.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.892
AND SELL IT!

11:33.894 --> 11:35.262
NOT BAD.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.132
WELL YEAH, BUT IS "NOT BAD"
GONNA WIN US $500?

11:39.166 --> 11:42.269
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.037
WE NEED A SPECIAL MOVE.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.173
A MOVE SO GOOD IT'LL
BLOW THE JUDGES AWAY.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.143
A MOVE I CALL "THE CYCLONE
OF AWESOMENESS."

11:50.177 --> 11:53.480
- WHAT'S THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST LIKE THE NAME.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.916
MAYBE WE COULD TRY THAT MOVE
WE SAW ON THE VIDEO.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.885
YOU MEAN THE ONE
WHERE THE GUY THREW
THE GIRL IN THE AIR?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.754
CAN WE JUST SAY THE BIG ONE
AND THE LITTLE ONE?

12:00.788 --> 12:03.490
FINE.
NOW PUT YOUR HAND ON TOP
OF MINE LIKE THE GIRL DID.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.026
LITTLE ONE!

12:06.059 --> 12:08.896
ALL RIGHT.
NOW I'M GONNA THROW YOU
AND YOU SPIN.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.965
AND WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE,
TRY TO DO AS MUCH TWIRLING
AS YOU CAN.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.268
OUT, FACE, CHEEKS,

12:15.302 --> 12:17.838
SMILE, BACK, SPIN

12:17.871 --> 12:18.872
AND THROW!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.774
WHOA!

12:24.978 --> 12:27.514
I DIDN'T SEE MUCH TWIRLING.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.884
IT COULD BE BECAUSE YOU
THREW ME INTO THE WALL.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.120
TRY IT AGAIN.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.955
READY.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.958
OUT, FACE, CHEEKS,

12:37.991 --> 12:42.095
- SMILE--
- WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.064
BROTHER STUFF.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.377
OH LOOK, CHARLIE,
THERE'S YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.391
HONEY, WHEN YOU LET THE GUY GO,
YOU KEEP THE TOYS!

13:14.227 --> 13:17.030
- MR. DUNCAN.
- MISS BLANKENHOOPER.

13:17.998 --> 13:21.301
( deep voice )
WELL, HELLO AGAIN.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.371
LISTEN, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I'M HAPPILY MARRIED.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.841
WELL, NOT HAPPILY.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.342
AND NOT ACTUALLY MARRIED.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.846
TELL SHIRLEY ALL ABOUT IT.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.316
( sighs )
LOOK, WE FOUND OUT THAT
OUR MARRIAGE WASN'T LEGAL,

13:36.349 --> 13:40.053
AND NOW WE'RE FIGHTING
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET
REMARRIED ON VACATION.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.056
I THINK SHE'S BEING
COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.927
LOOK, DOLL, NOBODY EVER SAID
LOVE WAS REASONABLE.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.931
AND A LITTLE ROMANTIC GESTURE
GOES A LONG WAY.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.267
THANKS.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.403
THAT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.

13:56.436 --> 14:01.274
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

14:04.144 --> 14:08.048
OKAY.
I'M WALKING AWAY NOW.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.420
MM-MM-MM.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.388
MAMA LIKE!

14:18.058 --> 14:20.928
LOOK, NOW THAT
WE'RE STUCK UP HERE,
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.031
BUT, SPENCER,
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.432
I MISS YOU, TEDDY.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.000
I MISS US.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.868
I CAME UP HERE
BECAUSE I WANT YOU BACK.

14:32.139 --> 14:35.042
NO, YOU CANNOT BE THE ONE.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.177
THE ONE WHAT?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.980
WELL, I MET THIS PSYCHIC,

14:40.013 --> 14:43.951
AND SHE TOLD ME I'D COME
FACE TO FACE WITH THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE ON THIS TRIP.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.054
AND I KEEP RUNNING
INTO YOU AND...

14:47.087 --> 14:50.490
EVERYTHING ELSE SHE
PREDICTED CAME TRUE, BUT...

14:52.359 --> 14:54.461
JUST I'M SO CONFUSED.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.065
I'M NOT.
TEDDY, WHEN I FOUND OUT
YOU WERE COMING UP HERE,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.100
SOMETHING TOLD ME
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.071
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I DO.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.907
AND YOU DO TOO.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.050
- ( creaks )
- WE'RE MOVING AGAIN.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.987
YES, WE ARE.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.962
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:28.996 --> 15:30.964
WE'LL BE LUCKY
TO FINISH SECOND.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.432
THERE ARE ONLY TWO TEAMS.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.467
SO YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.970
ATTENTION, GUESTS,

15:37.004 --> 15:41.174
THE PAIRS SKATING COMPETITION
WILL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST TEAM

15:41.208 --> 15:44.144
P.J. AND GABRIELLE DUNCAN.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.015
IT'S GABE.
I'M A DUDE!

15:53.020 --> 15:54.988
( instrumental music playing )

15:55.022 --> 15:56.990
- ( laughs )
- STOP THAT!

15:59.392 --> 16:02.762
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.366
AND ARMS ARMS,
HANDS, GRAB.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.041
WE NEED TO DO
THE CYCLONE OF AWESOMENESS.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.275
BUT I'VE NEVER
LANDED IT.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.077
NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO START.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.512
OUT, FACE, CHEEKS,

16:19.546 --> 16:21.548
SMILE.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.057
( screaming )

16:43.570 --> 16:46.206
- NAILED IT.
- ( cheering )

16:46.239 --> 16:49.842
Desk clerk:
AND OUR FIRST PLACE WINNER'S
P.J. AND GABRIELLE DUNCAN.

16:54.114 --> 16:57.350
- WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?
- I DON'T KNOW, FRONT DESK SAYS
THEY NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.187
IF IT'S ANYTHING
THE DUNCAN KIDS DID,
I'M AMY BLANKENHOOPER.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.589
WOW.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.228
NOW I KNOW THIS IS GOING
TO SEEM KIND OF SUDDEN

17:08.261 --> 17:11.164
AFTER THE 19 YEARS
AND THE MORTGAGE AND ALL,

17:11.198 --> 17:14.334
BUT, UM, HANG ON.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.539
WOULD YOU MARRY ME...
AGAIN?

17:22.209 --> 17:25.145
WELL, BOB, I HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS FIRST.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.582
HOW MANY KIDS
DO YOU WANT?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.219
- UH... FOUR.
- IT'S A DEAL.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.188
HEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
WE GOT A YES!

17:38.125 --> 17:40.427
- MAY I GIVE THE BRIDE AWAY?
- I'D BE HONORED.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.864
OKAY, CHARLIE,
LEAD THE WAY.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.234
( "Bridal March" playing )

18:04.517 --> 18:06.553
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO BACK OUT.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.261
I LOVE YOU.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.296
AND I LOVE YOU.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.634
YAY, CONGRATULATIONS!

18:21.668 --> 18:24.237
THEY HAVEN'T
GOTTEN MARRIED YET.

18:24.271 --> 18:27.340
COULD WE MOVE IT ALONG?
I JUST WANT TO GET
TO THE CAKE!

18:27.374 --> 18:29.542
OH MAN, I FORGOT
TO GET A CAKE.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.145
Desk clerk:
ATTENTION, GUESTS,

18:32.179 --> 18:36.283
THE WEDDING CAKE BAKING CONTEST
HAS JUST CONCLUDED.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.318
I LOVE THIS GUY.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.625
( laughs )

18:45.658 --> 18:48.428
UH, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
HI, EVERYONE.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.597
HI.
UM, I'D LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.501
TO MY HUSBAND BOB.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.670
EVEN AFTER ALMOST 20 YEARS

18:57.704 --> 19:01.608
EVERY TIME WE KISS, I FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.714
AND I HER.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.284
THAT'S IT?
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

19:17.624 --> 19:20.393
- HEY.
- HI.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.463
THAT WAS REALLY SWEET.
WELL, THE FIRST PART.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
YEAH, IT WAS.
UM...

19:27.334 --> 19:28.468
LISTEN, SPENCER,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.370
I HAVE-- I HAVE
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.741
- I REALLY LIKE YOU...
- I REALLY LIKE YOU TOO.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.410
...UH, BUT THE THING IS--

19:37.444 --> 19:39.779
WOW, THIS IS REALLY HARD.
UM...

19:42.449 --> 19:45.318
I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST BE FRIENDS.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.655
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE STUFF
WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE SKI LIFT

19:48.688 --> 19:50.690
AND OUR KISS?

19:50.723 --> 19:53.760
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW MY MOM SAID

19:53.793 --> 19:56.496
THAT EVERY TIME SHE KISSES
MY DAD SHE FALLS IN LOVE AGAIN?

19:56.529 --> 20:00.700
- YEAH.
- WELL, WHEN WE KISSED,
I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.236
OH.

20:03.270 --> 20:06.506
I MEAN, I USED TO,
BUT THIS TIME I DIDN'T.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
I'M SORRY.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.479
UM, SO WHAT NOW?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.415
FRIENDS?

20:17.284 --> 20:19.452
- FRIENDS.
- Amy: HEY, LADIES!

20:19.486 --> 20:21.821
- IT'S TIME TO THROW
THE BOUQUET.
- ( cheers )

20:34.701 --> 20:36.703
All: AWWWW!

20:40.507 --> 20:44.043
HEY, SO I GUESS
YOU NEVER SAW THE LOVE
OF YOUR LIFE, HUH?

20:44.076 --> 20:47.714
NOPE, BUT GUESS WHAT?
I'M ONLY 15.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.816
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

20:49.849 --> 20:52.719
YOU COULDN'T REALIZE THAT
BEFORE I TOOK A FOUR-HOUR
BUS TRIP?

20:52.752 --> 20:57.256
( laughs )
I'M JUST GLAD I DON'T HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT BOYS FOR A WHILE.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.499
- GO GET HIS NUMBER.
- I'M ON IT.

21:12.705 --> 21:16.843
Well, Charlie, we're back home
from your first family vacation,

21:16.876 --> 21:19.412
where you also went to your
first wedding--

21:19.446 --> 21:21.414
yep, Mom and Dad renewed
their vows of love.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.453
Okay, who is Shirley
and why is she calling
here, Bob?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.287
I am in the phone book.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.825
Yep, as you can see,
everything's pretty much
back to normal.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.094
How many times
have I told you?!

21:35.127 --> 21:37.430
You've gotta land
the triple lutz.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.333
( growls )
You're killing me!

21:40.367 --> 21:41.734
That's it, I quit!

21:41.768 --> 21:44.737
Where am I supposed
to find another partner
small enough to throw?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.639
Good luck, Charlie.

21:52.779 --> 21:56.816
I HEAR SOMETIMES
THESE THINGS GET STUCK.

22:00.887 --> 22:04.424
WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP,
MIND IF I GO FIRST?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.793
I'VE SEEN YOU SKI.
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.764
I COULD FLICK YOU
OFF HERE LIKE A BOOGER.

22:17.437 --> 22:21.674
A PSYCHIC TOLD ME I'D MEET
ON THIS TRIP.Y LIFE

22:26.913 --> 22:29.449
DOES YOUR FAMILY HAVE MONEY?

22:29.482 --> 22:31.884
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT MONEY IS.
