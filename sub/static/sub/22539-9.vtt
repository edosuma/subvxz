Yes, this is home.</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:15.436
<i>This is Earth.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:18.523
<i>Having trouble
finding a familiar continent?</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:21.404
<i>The past is another planet.</i>

00:21.563 --> 00:23.691
<i>Actually, many.</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:28.738
I'm standing on the great expanse of time
that has elapsed since the big bang.

00:28.904 --> 00:33.284
In order to think about it,
we've compressed it all into a single year.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.873
It's the early morning of December 23rd...

00:36.036 --> 00:41.008
...on this cosmic calendar of ours,
or about 350 million years ago...

00:41.166 --> 00:44.716
...when our world
was a mere four billion years old.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.300
Earth looks so different...

00:46.463 --> 00:48.215
...you might not even know the place.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.850
The stars wouldn't help you.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.308
Even the constellations
would have been different back then.

00:59.810 --> 01:04.111
The dinosaurs were still
more than 100 million years in the future.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.447
There were no birds, no flowers.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.907
And the air was different too.

01:12.614 --> 01:16.619
The atmosphere had more oxygen than at
any other time in Earth's history...

01:16.785 --> 01:18.662
...before or since.

01:18.829 --> 01:22.333
This allowed insects
to grow much larger than they do today.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.297
<font color="#D900D9">(RUSTLING)</font>

01:25.419 --> 01:28.218
How? Insects don't have lungs.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.849
Life-giving oxygen
is taken in through openings...

01:31.008 --> 01:32.681
...in the outside of their bodies...

01:32.843 --> 01:35.517
...and transported
through a network of tubes.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.522
If an insect were too large...

01:37.681 --> 01:40.730
...the outer reaches of these tubes
would absorb all the oxygen...

01:40.892 --> 01:43.361
...before it could ever get
to its internal organs.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.940
But during the Carboniferous period...

01:47.107 --> 01:50.407
...the atmosphere
had almost twice the oxygen as today.

01:50.569 --> 01:55.496
Insects could then grow much bigger and
still get enough oxygen in their bodies.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.877
That's why the dragonflies here
are as big as eagles...

01:59.036 --> 02:02.540
...and the millipedes,
the size of alligators.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.879
So why was there so much oxygen
backthen?

02:05.042 --> 02:09.013
It was produced by a new kind of life.

03:42.764 --> 03:47.520
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> What kind of life could've changed
the Earth's atmosphere so dramatically?</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:55.119
Plants that could reach for the sky:

03:55.861 --> 03:57.158
Trees.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.247
In their competition for sunlight,
trees evolved a way to defy gravity.

04:02.409 --> 04:06.539
Before trees, the tallest vegetation
was only about waist-high.

04:06.705 --> 04:10.255
And then something wonderful happened.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.850
<i>A plant molecule evolved
that was both strong and flexible...</i>

04:18.007 --> 04:20.351
<i>...a material that could support
a lot of weight...</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:23.013
<i>...yet bend in the wind without breaking.</i>

04:23.180 --> 04:25.729
Lignin made trees possible.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.859
Now life could build upward.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.986
And this opened a whole new territory...

04:30.145 --> 04:34.525
...a three-dimensional matrix
for communities far above the ground.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.036
Earth became the planet of the trees.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.414
But lignin had a downside.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.370
It was hard to swallow.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.336
When nature's demolition crew,
the fungi and bacteria...

04:46.495 --> 04:48.839
...tried to eat anything
with lignin in it...

04:48.997 --> 04:51.420
...they got a really bad case
of indigestion.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.759
And termites wouldn't evolve
for at least another 100 million years.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.800
What to do with all those dead trees?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.309
It took the fungi and bacteria
millions of years...

05:01.468 --> 05:05.189
...to evolve the biochemical means
to consume them.

05:05.347 --> 05:09.727
Meanwhile, the trees just kept
springing up, dying, falling over...

05:09.893 --> 05:12.988
...and getting buried by the mud
that built up over eons.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.241
Eventually, there were hundreds
of billions of trees...

05:16.399 --> 05:21.906
...entombed in the Earth,
buried forests all over the Earth.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.246
What possible harm could come from that?

05:35.043 --> 05:38.764
This cliff in Nova Scotia
is another kind of calendar.

05:40.423 --> 05:44.599
It tells the story of that other world
that once flourished right here.

05:44.761 --> 05:49.733
And this is the death mask
of that 300-million-year-old tree.

05:49.891 --> 05:54.442
It was cast by minerals that replaced
the original wood, cell by cell.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.606
In other words, a fossil.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.778
The tree surrendered its organic molecules
to the environment long ago...

06:00.944 --> 06:02.571
...its carbon and water.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.580
Only its shape remains.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.243
When this tree was alive,
it took in carbon dioxide and water...

06:08.410 --> 06:12.290
...and used sunlight to turn them
into energy-rich organic matter.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.800
The tree gave off oxygen
as a waste product.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.633
That's what trees and
other plants still do.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.057
<i>When plants die, they decay.</i>

06:23.216 --> 06:25.639
<i>And this reverses the transaction.</i>

06:25.802 --> 06:29.397
<i>Their organic matter combines with oxygen
and decomposes...</i>

06:29.556 --> 06:32.776
...putting carbon dioxide
back into the air.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.561
This balances the books...

06:34.728 --> 06:36.776
...for the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere.

06:37.439 --> 06:41.364
<i>But if the trees are buried
before they can decay, two things happen.</i>

06:41.526 --> 06:44.496
<i>They take the carbon
and the stored solar energy with them...</i>

06:44.654 --> 06:46.247
<i>...and leave the oxygen behind...</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:48.204
<i>...to build up in the atmosphere.</i>

06:48.366 --> 06:51.336
<i>That's what happened
around 300 million years ago.</i>

06:51.494 --> 06:52.962
<i>There was an oxygen surplus.</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:56.003
<i>That's how the bugs got so big.</i>

06:56.917 --> 06:59.215
<i>And what became of all that buried carbon?</i>

06:59.377 --> 07:03.007
<i>It lay there for eons
before dealing life on Earth...</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:08.763
<i>...its most devastating blow of all time.</i>

07:10.055 --> 07:13.525
<i>There are places on this planet
where you can walk through time...</i>

07:13.683 --> 07:16.687
<i>...and read the history
written in the rocks.</i>

07:16.853 --> 07:19.527
<i>This beach in Nova Scotia is one of them.</i>

07:19.689 --> 07:21.532
<i>Every la yer is a Page-</i>

07:21.691 --> 07:23.944
<i>Each one tells the story of a flood...</i>

07:24.110 --> 07:27.239
<i>...one after another,
over millions of years.</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:30.534
<i>The layer cake of flood deposits
was slowly buried...</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:33.579
<i>...and turned into rock
by heat and pressure.</i>

07:33.745 --> 07:35.873
<i>The same forces that built mountains...</i>

07:36.039 --> 07:40.545
<i>...then tilted and uplifted them,
along with the entombed fossil forest.</i>

07:40.710 --> 07:44.760
<i>The newer layers were always
deposited on top of the older ones.</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:47.051
<i>All the pages are in the correct order...</i>

07:47.217 --> 07:49.311
<i>...bearing witness to what happened here...</i>

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
<i>...over millions of years.</i>

07:52.097 --> 07:55.317
Back that way lies the more distant past.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.227
And with every step I take...

07:57.394 --> 08:00.364
...I move about 1000 years
closer to the present...

08:00.522 --> 08:03.901
...and away from the world
of 300 million years ago.

08:04.067 --> 08:08.163
Fifty million years later lies that way.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.629
This was the beginning of the end
of the Permian world...

08:19.791 --> 08:22.089
...an event of unequalled carnage.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.926
<i>The Permian is the darkest corridor
in this memorial...</i>

08:26.089 --> 08:30.765
<i>...to the broken branches on the Tree
of Life: the Halls of Extinction.</i>

08:31.428 --> 08:34.898
Death has never come so close
to reigning supreme on this world...

08:35.056 --> 08:37.775
...in the quarter billion years since.

08:37.933 --> 08:43.282
The eruptions, in what is now Siberia,
lasted for hundreds of thousands of years.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.287
The lava flooded and buried
more than a million square miles.

08:48.445 --> 08:53.918
This event dwarfs any volcanic eruption
in historical times.

09:13.636 --> 09:18.437
Huge quantities of carbon dioxide
came pouring out of the volcanic fissures.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.399
This greenhouse gas warmed the climate.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.691
And this is where the long-buried forests
of the earlier Carboniferous period...

09:25.857 --> 09:27.951
...reenter the story.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.487
During the intervening 5O million years...

09:30.653 --> 09:34.123
...those trees had turned
into immense deposits of coal.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.786
And as it happened, one of the world's
largest accumulations of coal...

09:37.952 --> 09:40.375
<i>...was buried right there in Siberia.</i>

09:40.538 --> 09:42.711
<i>The heat from the lava baked the coal...</i>

09:42.874 --> 09:46.424
<i>...driving methane and sulfur-rich gases
out of the ground.</i>

09:47.003 --> 09:51.930
They were laden with toxic
and radioactive ash particles.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.186
Coal smoke.

09:55.303 --> 10:00.810
This witch's brew polluted the atmosphere
and radically destabilized Earth's climate.

10:00.975 --> 10:06.072
A sulfuric acid haze blocked incoming
sunlight and darkened the planet.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.201
Global temperatures plummeted
to subfreezing.

10:13.154 --> 10:17.580
During lulls in the eruption,
the acid haze fell back to the surface.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.996
But the carbon dioxide remained
and built up in the atmosphere...

10:21.162 --> 10:23.005
...to cause global warming.

10:23.164 --> 10:27.340
Years of frigid cold alternating
with millennia of stifling heat...

10:27.502 --> 10:30.301
...battered a dwindling population
of plants and animals.

10:30.463 --> 10:35.845
They had no chance to adapt
to the drastic swings in climate.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.437
As the global warming continued...

10:41.599 --> 10:44.273
...the surface and the bottom waters
slowly mixed...

10:44.435 --> 10:48.156
...raising the temperature
of the once-frigid depths of the sea floor.

10:48.314 --> 10:53.571
Methane-rich ices that had been frozen
in the sediments began to melt.

10:57.907 --> 11:02.378
Newly liberated methane gas made its way
to the surface, and into the atmosphere.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.800
Methane traps heat far more efficiently
than carbon dioxide...

11:06.958 --> 11:09.882
...so the climate got even hotter.

11:10.044 --> 11:14.015
And the methane also destroyed
the ozone layer in the stratosphere.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.853
The natural sunscreen
that protects life

11:16.865 --> 11:19.556
from deadly ultraviolet
rays was eaten away.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.110
The circulatory system
of the world ocean shut down.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.401
<i>These stagnant waters
became oxygen-starved...</i>

11:28.563 --> 11:30.941
<i>...killing almost all the fish in the sea.</i>

11:31.107 --> 11:34.361
<i>But one kind of life flourished
in this brutal environment.</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:37.952
<i>Bacteria that produced
deadly hydrogen sulfide gas...</i>

11:38.114 --> 11:40.287
...as a waste product.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.207
That was the last straw.

11:43.369 --> 11:49.047
The poison gas killed almost all the
remaining plants and animals on the land.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.133
This was the Great Dying...

11:52.295 --> 11:56.266
...the closest life on Earth
has ever come to annihilation.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.849
Nine in ten of all species perished.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.639
It took a long time for
life to bounce back.

12:02.805 --> 12:06.025
For a few million years,
Earth could have been called...

12:06.184 --> 12:07.982
...the Planet of the Dead.

12:09.103 --> 12:13.574
We are descended from one of the few
species that managed to squeak by.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.744
You are human and alive
at this very moment...

12:19.906 --> 12:23.706
...because they managed to endure,
conveying their DNA...

12:23.868 --> 12:28.089
...through one of the most treacherous
periods in the history of life.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.188
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
This mountain was made entirely by life.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.354
The life that flourished
back in the glory days of the Permian...

12:50.520 --> 12:52.898
...before all hell broke loose.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.193
This is part of the 400 mile-long
Guadalupe Mountain chain...

12:56.359 --> 12:58.532
...that runs through Texas and New Mexico.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.949
It's the world's largest fossil reef.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.369
All this was once a great inland sea.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.126
<i>The reef flourished and grew
for millions of years...</i>

13:09.289 --> 13:12.714
<i>...and was home to multitudes
of sponges, green algae...</i>

13:12.875 --> 13:16.004
<i>...and animals too small to see.</i>

13:16.170 --> 13:17.592
<i>When these creatures died...</i>

13:17.755 --> 13:20.474
<i>...they sank to the bottom
and were buried in the silt.</i>

13:20.633 --> 13:21.930
<i>Over millions of years...</i>

13:22.093 --> 13:26.189
<i>...their remains were converted
into oil and gas.</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:30.193
Eventually, the basin silted in
and the reef died.

13:30.351 --> 13:34.822
This marine ghost town
was then buried a mile beneath the surface.

13:34.981 --> 13:39.202
Later, tectonic forces lifted the
skeletal reef high above sea level...

13:39.360 --> 13:43.081
...where it was eroded and sculpted
over eons by wind and rain.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.873
<i>Just imagine what this place looked like
275 million years ago...</i>

13:48.036 --> 13:50.789
<i>...when it was a vibrant,
tropical inland sea...</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:55.335
...dotted with islands, brimming with life.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.012
Until about 220 million years ago...

14:01.174 --> 14:04.678
...New England and North Africa
were next-door neighbors.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.938
There was no such thing
as the Atlantic Ocean.

14:07.096 --> 14:11.272
Those thin blue fingers at the center,
they were lakes.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.152
They were the first outward signs...

14:13.311 --> 14:15.905
...that the supercontinent
was splitting apart...

14:16.064 --> 14:19.113
...and that life on Earth
was due for another big shake-up.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.620
A million years later,
the lakes became a long bay...

14:22.779 --> 14:25.623
...which would grow into
the Atlantic Ocean.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.001
These profound changes at the surface...

14:28.159 --> 14:31.789
...were merely symptoms of a drama
that was unfolding far beneath...

14:31.954 --> 14:33.376
...in the depths of the Earth.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.385
By the time we got here...

14:37.543 --> 14:40.017
...the telltale traces
of global upheaval were

14:40.029 --> 14:42.515
buried at the bottom
of the deep blue sea.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.769
We were completely cut off from the
great story of Earth's violent past.

14:47.512 --> 14:51.938
A species of amnesiacs trying
to find out who we were...

14:52.100 --> 14:54.569
...and what happened before we awakened.

14:55.895 --> 15:01.243
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> In 1570, Abraham Ortelius created
the first modern world atlas...</i>

15:01.401 --> 15:04.701

15:04.862 --> 15:07.786
<i>the Golden Age of Exploration.</i>

15:07.949 --> 15:09.496
<i>Before the ink was dry...</i>

15:09.659 --> 15:12.082
<i>...Ortelius stepped back
from his masterpiece...</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:16.625

<i>...for the next couple of centuries...</i>

15:33.683 --> 15:38.154
<i>...until an early 20th century
German astronomer and meteorologist...</i>

15:38.312 --> 15:42.033
<i>...amassed the evidence
to build the scientific case for it.</i>

15:42.191 --> 15:45.570
<i>Alfred Wegener had been drafted
during the First World War...</i>

15:45.736 --> 15:47.704
<i>...but was wounded soon after.</i>

15:48.239 --> 15:51.994
<i>As he recovered in a field hospital,
he scoured scientific literature...</i>

15:52.160 --> 15:55.255
<i>...for clues to the Earth's past.</i>

15:55.413 --> 15:59.043
<i>Years before, Wegener had happened
upon an intriguing paper...</i>

15:59.208 --> 16:02.212
<i>...in the stacks of his university library.</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:07.179
<i>It puzzled Wegener that fossils of the
same species of a now-extinct fern...</i>

16:07.341 --> 16:11.391
<i>...were reported to be found
on both sides of the Atlantic.</i>

16:11.554 --> 16:12.680
<i>Even more curious...</i>

16:12.847 --> 16:17.728
<i>...were the discoveries of fossils
of the same dinosaurs on both continents.</i>

16:17.894 --> 16:19.237
<i>In the early 20th century...</i>

16:19.395 --> 16:22.319
<i>...geologists explained
how life crossed the oceans...</i>

16:22.482 --> 16:27.033
<i>...by imagining that land bridges
had once existed between them.</i>

16:27.195 --> 16:30.039
<i>It was thought that these bridges
gradually disintegrated...</i>

16:30.198 --> 16:33.543
<i>...and vanished
beneath the waves long ago.</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:36.500
<i>But there was one piece of evidence
that convinced Wegener...</i>

16:36.662 --> 16:39.632
<i>...that the prevailing scientific view
must be wrong:</i>

16:39.790 --> 16:42.418
<i>the Earth itself.</i>

16:42.585 --> 16:45.429
<i>Why would a mountain range
cross the oceanic divide...</i>

16:45.588 --> 16:47.761
<i>...to continue on another continent?</i>

16:47.924 --> 16:50.268
<i>And why would you find
the same unique pattern...</i>

16:50.426 --> 16:54.226
<i>...in the layers of rocks
in both Brazil and South Africa?</i>

16:54.388 --> 16:58.768
<i>And another thing: Under what circumstances
could tropical plants have flourished...</i>

16:58.935 --> 17:02.189
<i>...in the frozen wastes of the Arctic?</i>

17:02.772 --> 17:06.902
<i>Wegener concluded that there was only
one logical solution to this puzzle:</i>

17:07.068 --> 17:10.617
<i>There had once been a single
supercontinent on Earth.</i>

17:10.780 --> 17:14.000
<i>He named it Pangaea.</i>

17:14.157 --> 17:18.413
So Wegener becomes the toast
of the scientific world, right?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.001
Not exactly.

17:20.164 --> 17:24.385
Most geologists ridiculed
Wegener's hypothesis of continental drift.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.381
They preferred
their imaginary natural land bridges...

17:28.548 --> 17:30.391
...to explain away Wegener's evidence.

17:32.301 --> 17:38.479
How, they asked, could a continent plow
through the solid rock of the ocean floor?

17:38.641 --> 17:41.315
Wegener had no convincing answer.

17:41.477 --> 17:46.483
He became the laughingstock of the field,
a pariah at scientific conferences.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.987
<i>Despite this,
Wegener continued to fight for his ideas...</i>

17:51.153 --> 17:55.579
<i>...conducting daring research expeditions
to gather evidence.</i>

17:55.741 --> 18:01.089
<i>On one of these, he learned that colleagues
were trapped on an ice cap without food.</i>

18:01.247 --> 18:05.423
<i>On his way back from the mission,
he became lost in a blizzard.</i>

18:05.585 --> 18:09.556
<i>A day or two after his 50th birthday,
he disappeared...</i>

18:09.714 --> 18:12.809
<i>...never knowing that, in time,
he would be vindicated...</i>

18:12.967 --> 18:16.187
<i>...and come to be viewed as one of
the greatest geologists in history.</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:27.820
Scientists are human.
We have our blind spots and prejudices.

18:27.982 --> 18:31.532
Science is a mechanism
designed to ferret them out.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.870
Problem is, we aren't always faithful
to the core values of science.

off-limits to all but a few of us.</i>

Two-thirds of the Earth lies beneath
more than 1000 feet of water.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.756
It's a vast and largely
unexplored frontier.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.508
Everybody knows the Alps and the Rockies...

20:51.667 --> 20:55.513
...but some of the world's most amazing
mountain ranges are hidden from view.

20:57.798 --> 21:03.851
Below a thousand meters, we enter a
world where there is no sunlight.

was the first to imagine.

21:39.173 --> 21:44.521
<i>The highest peaks of the ridge rise
over four kilometers above the ocean floor.</i>

21:44.678 --> 21:48.558
<i>There are sprawling mountain ranges
and canyons too.</i>

21:48.724 --> 21:53.070
<i>We've now entered the Marianas Trench,
the deepest canyon on Earth...</i>

21:53.229 --> 21:55.323
<i>...more than ten kilometers deep.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:58.360
<i>It formed when tectonic forces
pushed the seabed...</i>

21:58.526 --> 22:00.654
<i>...under the adjoining continental plate.</i>

22:00.820 --> 22:06.293
More people have walked on the moon
than have ever been down here.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.920
The pressure here
is a crushing eight tons per square inch.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.294
<i>Being this deep in the ocean...</i>

22:12.456 --> 22:15.881
<i>...is like having 50 jumbo jets

22:16.043 --> 22:20.719
<i>Yet even here, life has taken hold.</i>

22:23.217 --> 22:26.096
<i>The fact that sunlight
can't penetrate the deep ocean...</i>

22:26.262 --> 22:28.390
<i>...doesn't mean there

22:28.556 --> 22:31.400
<i>Many underwater species glow in the dark...</i>

22:31.559 --> 22:34.438
<i>...through a process
called bioluminescence.</i>

22:35.104 --> 22:39.575
<i>Our long history as land mammals,
denizens of the sunlit world...</i>

22:39.733 --> 22:42.782
<i>...hasn't prepared us
for the amazing variety of life...</i>

22:42.945 --> 22:45.915
<i>...that evolution has crafted
in the deep oceans.</i>

22:48.284 --> 22:53.040
<i>Since there's no sunlight down here,
there's no photosynthesis.</i>

22:54.123 --> 22:57.127
<i>That means there are no
plants to feed on...</i>

22:57.293 --> 23:00.968
<i>...and yet, even here,

23:01.130 --> 23:03.303
<i>...there's a thriving food chain.</i>

23:03.465 --> 23:06.389
It begins with a process
called chemosynthesis.

23:06.552 --> 23:12.230
<i>These microscopic creatures have learned
to eat what's pouring out of that vent...</i>

23:13.642 --> 23:16.771
<i>...a noxious compound
called hydrogen sulfide.</i>

23:16.937 --> 23:20.191

provides the chemical energy...

23:20.357 --> 23:22.325

23:22.985 --> 23:25.579
<i>Tiny crustaceans eat the bacteria...</i>

<i>...and the larger animals
eat the crustaceans.</i>

23:33.203 --> 23:35.080
<i>One day, on some future Earth...</i>

23:35.247 --> 23:39.047
...these mountains could very well end up
above the water.

23:39.209 --> 23:42.588
Tectonic forces continue
to shape our planet.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.850
The future is also another planet.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.521
It was a volcano like this one

<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> We live on the crust
of a seething cauldron.</i>

24:16.455 --> 24:19.379
At the center of our planet,
there's an iron core.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.886
It's nested inside of a larger,
liquid iron shell.

24:23.045 --> 24:26.720
<i>Wrapped over this
is the part called the mantle.</i>

24:26.882 --> 24:30.056
<i>It's rocky, but hot and viscous.</i>

24:30.219 --> 24:34.895
Like a pot of soup cooking on a stove,
the mantle is churning.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.309
What keeps it moving?

24:36.475 --> 24:40.230
Two things: the heat leftover
from Earth's formation...

24:40.396 --> 24:43.991
...and the decay of radioactive elements
in the core.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.572
And this outer layer, the crust...

24:46.735 --> 24:49.409
...where you and me
and everyone we know lives...

24:49.571 --> 24:53.075
...it's only as thick as
the skin on an apple.

24:53.242 --> 24:57.042
The mantle drags
the solid overlying crust along with it.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.754
<i>The crust resists
because it's cool and rigid.</i>

25:00.916 --> 25:03.886
<i>From time to time,
it reaches the breaking point.</i>

25:04.044 --> 25:08.220
<i>When that happens, the Earth quakes.</i>

25:08.382 --> 25:11.682
<i>It's not because somebody misbehaved
and is being punished.</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:16.099
<i>It's due to random forces
that are governed by the laws of nature.</i>

25:16.265 --> 25:19.360
Our sense of the stability
of the Earth is an illusion...

25:19.518 --> 25:21.612
...due to the shortness of our lives.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.692
<i>If we could watch our planet
on its own timescale...</i>

25:25.858 --> 25:30.455
<i>...in which big changes
take millions of years to play out...</i>

25:30.612 --> 25:35.459
<i>...we would see it
as the dynamic organism it really is.</i>

25:40.414 --> 25:43.668
This is the world
of the late Triassic Period...

25:43.834 --> 25:46.758
...about 200 million years ago.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.885
<i>That little guy?</i>

25:49.048 --> 25:51.301

25:51.467 --> 25:54.311
He lived in Newark, New Jersey.

25:56.472 --> 25:59.442
<i>Wherever you walk on Earth...</i>

26:00.601 --> 26:03.650
<i>...lost worlds lie buried
beneath your feet.</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:05.906
<i>Fifty or a hundred million years ago...</i>

26:06.065 --> 26:11.492
<i>...even the most seemingly ordinary places
have been the scene of epic change.</i>

26:11.653 --> 26:16.830
<i>These Palisades are a monument to the
breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea.</i>

26:17.493 --> 26:20.485
<i>The sequence of volcanic
eruptions that made these</i>

26:20.497 --> 26:23.500
<i>cliffs also led to the
next mass extinction.</i>

26:23.665 --> 26:26.965
<i>The one that ended the Triassic world.</i>

26:27.127 --> 26:30.176
But a catastrophic extinction event
for one species...

26:30.339 --> 26:32.262
...is a golden opportunity for another.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.520
<i>The Triassic extinctions offered one group
that had been around for a while...</i>

26:40.682 --> 26:43.606
<i>...the chance to take center stage.</i>

26:47.147 --> 26:52.028
<i>The dinosaurs had a good long run
for 170 million years.</i>

26:53.237 --> 26:55.865
<i>Back then, India was an island.</i>

26:56.031 --> 26:59.535
<i>It crept northward at the pace
of a few inches per year...</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:03.331
<i>...on its slow but inexorable rendezvous
with Asia.</i>

27:03.497 --> 27:08.754
<i>Then, once again, the molten rock
beneath Earth's surface burst forth...</i>

27:08.919 --> 27:12.139
<i>...and ï¬‚ooded a huge area of western India.</i>

27:19.221 --> 27:23.567
The knockout punch
literally came out of the blue.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.687
Few animals larger
than a hundred pounds...

28:04.850 --> 28:08.070
...survived the catastrophes
of the late Cretaceous.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.983
The dust cloud brought night and cold
to the surface for months.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.369
The dinosaurs froze and starved to death.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.827
But there were small creatures
who took shelter in the Earth.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.707
<i>And when they emerged...</i>

28:20.866 --> 28:24.871
...they found that the monsters who had
hunted and terrorized them were gone.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.712
The Earth was becoming
the Planet of the Mammals.

28:29.249 --> 28:33.049
<i>And the Earth continued
its ceaseless changing.</i>

28:34.838 --> 28:37.808
This was once a desert
where nothing could grow.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.561
It was a million square miles
of sand and salt...

28:41.720 --> 28:44.974
...far more hostile
than any environment on Earth today.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.394
Daytime temperatures
were hot enough to bake bread.

28:48.852 --> 28:52.948
And it was more than a mile below sea
level, so the atmospheric pressure...

28:53.106 --> 28:56.280
...was about 50 percent higher
than what we're used to.

28:56.443 --> 29:00.243
It would be hard to think of a more
unpromising environment on this planet.

29:00.405 --> 29:05.332
Yet this was the basin of the Mediterranean
five and a half million years ago...

29:05.494 --> 29:07.792
...before it became a sea.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.504
The Earth never stops moving for long.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.379
<i>The natural dam at the western end
of the deep basin gave way...</i>

29:15.545 --> 29:17.513
<i>...probably due to earthquakes.</i>

29:17.673 --> 29:20.176
<i>And the deluge began.</i>

29:21.009 --> 29:26.061
The torrential waters rushed in at a rate
40,000 times greater than Niagara Falls...

29:26.223 --> 29:32.731
...turning a vast desert into the
Mediterranean Sea in less than a year.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.948
There were as yet no humans
to witness this enormous flood...

29:38.110 --> 29:41.034
...nor to admire the beauty it created.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.164
Meanwhile, half a world away...

29:43.323 --> 29:47.123
<i>...a broad channel
separated North and South America...</i>

29:47.286 --> 29:51.757
<i>...allowing ocean currents to ï¬‚ow
from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean.</i>

29:51.915 --> 29:55.510
<i>Tectonic forces gradually brought
these two continents together...</i>

29:55.669 --> 30:00.015
<i>...closing the channel
and creating the Isthmus of Panama.</i>

30:00.173 --> 30:03.473
This reorganized the worldwide pattern
of ocean currents...

30:03.635 --> 30:06.058
...which, in turn, affected
the global climate.

30:09.433 --> 30:15.361
<i>In Africa, the lush green forest canopy
gave way to a sparser landscape.</i>

30:15.522 --> 30:20.574
<i>Some species that were highly specialized
for life in the trees became extinct.</i>

30:20.736 --> 30:23.990
<i>But the generalists, the ones
that could find a way to make a living...</i>

30:24.156 --> 30:28.536
<i>...no matter what life threw at them,
endured and evolved.</i>

30:31.747 --> 30:34.421
<i>Our ancestors had once burrowed deep
in the ground...</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:37.883
<i>...to avoid predators who
stalked the surface.</i>

30:38.045 --> 30:41.595
But when the dinosaurs perished,
they emerged into the daylight...

30:41.757 --> 30:45.557
...and over the eons, made new lives
in the branches of the trees.

30:45.719 --> 30:49.599
<i>They developed opposable thumbs and toes
for swinging from branch to branch...</i>

30:49.765 --> 30:53.941
<i>...across the broad canopy of treetops,
where all their needs were fulfilled.</i>

30:54.102 --> 30:57.732
They could also walk upright,
but only for short distances.

30:57.898 --> 31:01.448
<i>With so many trees around,
they didn't have to go very far.</i>

31:01.610 --> 31:05.035
<i>But then it got colder,
and the trees thinned out.</i>

31:05.197 --> 31:07.245
<i>Broad grasslands sprang up...</i>

31:07.407 --> 31:10.877
<i>...and our ancestors were forced
to traverse them in search of food.</i>

31:11.036 --> 31:14.961
<i>You needed a totally different skill set
to make it on the savanna.</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:17.967
In the old days, you could sit perched
on your tree branch...

31:18.126 --> 31:20.470
...and watch the big cats
from a safe distance.

31:20.629 --> 31:24.805
<i>Now you were playing
on the same dangerous field.</i>

31:27.636 --> 31:29.980
<i>The survivors were those
who evolved the ability...</i>

31:30.138 --> 31:35.065
<i>...to walk great distances on their
hind legs and to run when necessary.</i>

31:35.894 --> 31:38.363
This changed the way they looked
at the world.

31:38.522 --> 31:41.696
Hands and arms
were no longer tied up with walking.

31:41.858 --> 31:45.954
They were free to gather food
and pick up sticks and bones.

31:46.113 --> 31:50.289
These could be used as weapons and tools.
Think of it.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.705
<i>A change in the topography
of a small piece of land...</i>

31:53.870 --> 31:57.340
<i>...half a world away
reroutes ocean currents.</i>

31:57.499 --> 31:59.877
<i>Africa grows colder and drier.</i>

32:00.043 --> 32:02.671
<i>Most of the trees
can't withstand the new climate.</i>

32:02.838 --> 32:06.263
<i>The primates who lived in them
have to seek other homes...</i>

32:06.425 --> 32:10.680
...and before you know it,
they're using tools to remake the planet.

32:10.846 --> 32:14.441
The Earth has shaped the course
of human destiny...

32:14.599 --> 32:19.446
...but so has the invisible pull
of distant worlds.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.267
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
The planets have influenced our lives...

32:49.426 --> 32:51.224
...but not in the way you think.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.184
The gravitational pull of Venus...

32:54.139 --> 32:55.686
<i>...small but close...</i>

32:55.849 --> 32:59.319
<i>...and that of Jupiter,
distant but massive...</i>

33:00.187 --> 33:04.408
<i>...tilted the Earth's
axis this way and that...</i>

33:06.401 --> 33:09.951
<i>...and ever so slightly
tweaked the shape of its orbit.</i>

33:12.574 --> 33:14.900
This periodically altered
the amount of sunlight

33:14.912 --> 33:17.250
falling on the edge of
the northern ice cap.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.088
Sometimes
it made the summers there colder...

33:23.251 --> 33:26.505
...and the glaciers advanced southward
from one year to the next...

33:26.671 --> 33:30.767
<i>...grinding and scraping,
and crushing everything in their path.</i>

33:32.761 --> 33:35.014
That's what we call an Ice Age.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.933
At other times,
changes in Earth's axis and orbit...

33:38.099 --> 33:39.942
...made the Arctic summers warmer.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.857
And the melting glaciers began to retreat.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.451
Imagine how resourceful
our ancestors had to be...

33:48.610 --> 33:51.409
...in order to survive
these radical changes in climate.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.244
<i>With each glacial period...</i>

33:53.406 --> 33:56.626
<i>...the ice sheets grow
at the expense of the oceans.</i>

33:56.785 --> 33:59.629
<i>The world sea level falls
by more than 400 feet...</i>

33:59.788 --> 34:04.464
<i>...uncovering wide areas of land
along the edges of the continents.</i>

34:04.626 --> 34:09.507
<i>Fifteen to 25,000 years ago,
there was a period when the ice receded...</i>

34:09.672 --> 34:12.096
<i>...exposing a temporary land bridge.</i>

34:12.259 --> 34:16.059
<i>The gateway to the other half
of the planet swings open.</i>

34:16.221 --> 34:20.897
<i>Bands of wanderers crossed the land bridge
to North America and parts south.</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:27.658
About 10,000 years ago, the manic swings of
the climate and sea levels came to a stop.

34:27.815 --> 34:31.411
A new and gentler climate age began.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.494
It's the one we live in now.

34:34.656 --> 34:38.502
When the great ice sheets melted,
the sea rose to its present height...

34:39.619 --> 34:41.996
<i>...and the rivers carried silt
from the highlands...</i>

34:42.163 --> 34:45.542
<i>...to build great delta plains
where they met the sea.</i>

34:45.708 --> 34:49.464
<i>On those fertile plains,
we learned a new way of life.</i>

34:49.629 --> 34:53.679
<i>How to grow things,
to feed ourselves and more.</i>

34:53.842 --> 34:59.019
<i>For most of us, this meant an end
to a million years of wandering.</i>

34:59.848 --> 35:04.524
The way the planets tug at each other,
the way the skin of the Earth moves...

35:04.686 --> 35:09.533
...the way those motions affect climate and
the evolution of life and intelligence...

35:09.691 --> 35:14.367
<i>...they all combined to give us the means
to turn the mud of those river deltas...</i>

35:14.529 --> 35:17.624
<i>...into the first civilizations.</i>

35:18.325 --> 35:21.380
<i>There's nothing like an
interglacial period, one</i>

35:21.392 --> 35:24.458
<i>of those balmy intermissions
in an ice age.</i>

35:25.081 --> 35:28.335
<i>And the great news
is that this one is due to last...</i>

35:28.501 --> 35:32.347
<i>...for another 50,000 years.</i>

35:33.798 --> 35:36.392
<i>What a break for our kind.</i>

35:37.552 --> 35:38.804
<i>Just one problem.</i>

35:38.970 --> 35:42.224
<i>We can't seem to stop
burning up all those buried trees...</i>

35:42.390 --> 35:46.190
<i>...from way back in the Carboniferous Age,
in the form of coal...</i>

35:46.353 --> 35:51.359
<i>...and the remains of ancient plankton,
in the form of oil and gas.</i>

35:53.068 --> 35:56.038
<i>If we could, we'd be
home free, climate-wise.</i>

35:56.196 --> 35:59.621
<i>Instead, we are dumping carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere...</i>

35:59.783 --> 36:02.274
<i>...at a rate the Earth
hasn't seen since the</i>

36:02.286 --> 36:04.789
<i>great climate
catastrophes of the past.</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:07.423
<i>The ones that led to mass extinctions.</i>

36:07.582 --> 36:11.428
<i>We just can't seem to break
our addiction to the kinds of fuel...</i>

36:11.586 --> 36:15.090
<i>...that'll bring back a climate
last seen by the dinosaurs.</i>

36:15.256 --> 36:17.355
<i>A climate that will drown
our coastal cities</i>

36:17.367 --> 36:19.477
<i>and wreak havoc on
the environment...</i>

36:19.636 --> 36:23.140
<i>...and our ability to feed ourselves.</i>

36:24.140 --> 36:29.772
<i>All the while, the glorious sun pours
immaculate, free energy down upon us...</i>

36:29.938 --> 36:32.157
<i>...more than we will ever need.</i>

36:32.315 --> 36:35.034
<i>Why can't we summon
the ingenuity and courage...</i>

36:35.193 --> 36:38.163
<i>...of the generations that came before us?</i>

36:38.321 --> 36:41.621
<i>The dinosaurs never saw
that asteroid coming.</i>

36:41.783 --> 36:44.536
<i>What's our excuse?</i>

36:53.712 --> 36:57.165
There's a corridor in
the Halls of Extinction

36:57.177 --> 37:00.641
that is, right now,
empty and unmarked.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.773
The autobiography of the Earth
is still being written.

37:04.931 --> 37:09.903
There's a chance
that the end of our story lies in there.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.659
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
Congratulations.</i>

37:21.114 --> 37:23.208
<i>You're alive.</i>

37:23.825 --> 37:29.173
<i>There's an unbroken thread that stretches
across more than three billion years...</i>

37:29.330 --> 37:34.211
<i>...that connects us to the first life
that ever touched this world.</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:37.850
<i>Think of how tough,
resourceful and lucky all</i>

37:37.862 --> 37:40.513
<i>of our countless ancestors
must have been...</i>

37:40.675 --> 37:46.353
<i>...to survive long enough to pass on
the message of life to the next...</i>

37:46.973 --> 37:51.774
<i>...and the next and the next generation...</i>

37:52.187 --> 37:55.282
<i>...hundreds of millions of times...</i>

37:59.986 --> 38:01.954
<i>...before it came to us.</i>

38:05.492 --> 38:09.872
<i>There were so many rivers to cross,
so many hazards along the way.</i>

38:10.038 --> 38:13.838
<i>Predators, starvation,
disease, miscalculation...</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:17.800
<i>...long winters, drought,
flood and violence.</i>

38:17.962 --> 38:21.717
<i>Not to mention the occasional upheavals
that erupted from within our planet...</i>

38:21.883 --> 38:24.887
<i>...and the apocalyptic bolts
that come from the blue.</i>

38:25.053 --> 38:28.899
<i>No matter where we hail from
or who our parents were...</i>

38:29.057 --> 38:33.654
<i>...we are descended from the hearty
survivors of unimaginable catastrophes.</i>

38:33.812 --> 38:39.194
<i>Each of us is a runner in the longest and
most dangerous relay race there ever was...</i>

38:39.359 --> 38:43.080
<i>...and at this moment,
we hold the baton in our hands.</i>

38:48.243 --> 38:51.417
<i>The past is another planet.</i>

38:53.248 --> 38:55.467
And so is the future.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.504
Some 250 million years from now...

38:58.670 --> 39:01.423
...many geologists think
that the lands of the Earth...

39:01.589 --> 39:04.263
...will be united once again.

39:17.939 --> 39:22.069
<i>All this beauty will have vanished
and the Earth of our moment in time...</i>

39:22.235 --> 39:25.830
<i>...will take its place
among the lost worlds.</i>

39:26.739 --> 39:30.869
<i>The great internal engine of plate
tectonics is indifferent to life...</i>

39:31.035 --> 39:34.164
<i>...as are the small changes
in the Earth's orbit and tilt...</i>

39:34.330 --> 39:38.676
<i>...and the occasional collisions
with little worlds on rogue orbits.</i>

39:38.835 --> 39:41.884
<i>These processes have no notion
of what has been going on...</i>

39:42.046 --> 39:44.845
<i>...over billions of years
on our planet's surface.</i>

39:45.008 --> 39:47.511
<i>They do not care.</i>

39:47.677 --> 39:50.430
<i>Each of us is a tiny being...</i>

39:50.597 --> 39:53.521
<i>...riding on the outermost skin
of one of the smaller planets...</i>

39:53.683 --> 39:57.404
<i>...for a few dozen trips
around the local star.</i>

39:59.981 --> 40:02.075
<i>The things that live the
longest on Earth...</i>

40:02.233 --> 40:05.908
<i>...endure for only about a millionth
of the age of our planet.</i>

40:06.070 --> 40:10.667
<i>So, of course, the individual organisms
see nothing of the overall pattern.</i>

40:10.825 --> 40:13.704
<i>Of changing continents...</i>

40:13.870 --> 40:15.543
<i>...climate...</i>

40:17.165 --> 40:18.712
<i>. . . evolution.</i>

40:18.875 --> 40:21.253
<i>That we understand
even a little of our origins...</i>

40:21.419 --> 40:25.640
<i>...is one of the great triumphs
of human insight and courage.</i>

40:25.798 --> 40:29.302
<i>Who we are and why we are here
can only be glimpsed...</i>

40:29.469 --> 40:32.143
<i>...by piecing together something
of the full picture...</i>

40:32.305 --> 40:35.650
<i>...which must encompass eons of time...</i>

40:36.726 --> 40:39.229
<i>...millions of species...</i>

40:42.273 --> 40:45.197
<i>...and a multitude of worlds.</i>

40:52.450 --> 40:56.250
In this perspective, it's not surprising
that we're a mystery to ourselves...

40:56.412 --> 40:59.131
...and that despite our
manifest pretension...

40:59.290 --> 41:02.214
...we are far from being masters
of our own little house.

41:08.216 --> 41:12.938
This new corridor has no name above the
entrance to designate its epoch...

41:13.096 --> 41:15.713
...and we don't yet know
which failed species

41:15.725 --> 41:18.353
will be memorialized
within its walls.

41:19.060 --> 41:25.568
What happens here, in countless ways, both
large and small, is being written by us.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.827
Right now.
