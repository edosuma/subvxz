01:18.467 --> 01:20.868
You want some?
I made it myself.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.601
Hey, Peg.
I got you something

01:25.601 --> 01:28.501
that's going to make
your life much easier.

01:28.501 --> 01:31.267
You got a night job?

01:31.267 --> 01:33.601
No. I already got
one of those.

01:33.601 --> 01:36.868
It's called getting
in bed with you.

01:36.868 --> 01:42.167
Well, then,
you've been missing work.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.234
Anyhow, you know
how you're always complaining

01:44.234 --> 01:47.033
Buck never comes
when you call him?

01:47.033 --> 01:49.934
Well, I got you one of those
silent dog whistles. Watch.

01:49.934 --> 01:52.801
Here, Buck.

01:52.801 --> 01:54.868
Now watch this.

02:00.133 --> 02:02.934
Go on, sit there
and rust.

02:02.934 --> 02:06.334
Speaking of items just
sitting and rusting away,

02:06.334 --> 02:08.334
it's Thursday night.

02:08.334 --> 02:09.734
Oh, nice timing, Peg.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.234
You know I'm going
bowling tonight.

02:11.234 --> 02:14.234
I was going to try
to break 200.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.033
Now I got this
hanging over my head.

02:16.033 --> 02:17.367
Thanks a lot, Peg.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.367
And what's this
doing out?

02:19.367 --> 02:20.801
Are we having dinner,

02:20.801 --> 02:23.701
or is this just
to tease me and the kids?

02:23.701 --> 02:25.067
No, it's for later.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.334

are coming over.

Quick! I've got to go!

02:33.801 --> 02:35.634
Peg! Where's
my lucky bowling socks?

02:35.634 --> 02:39.734
Downstairs, warding
off evil spirits.

Hi!
Hi!

02:48.100 --> 02:51.000
Come on in, girls.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.767
Go straight
into the kitchen.

AL: There's plaster falling
on my head down here!

02:57.000 --> 02:57.868
Keep cadence, will you?

02:59.067 --> 03:00.234
Don't worry.

03:00.234 --> 03:01.634
He'll be going
bowling soon.

03:01.634 --> 03:04.234
I know.
He's meeting my Dennis.

03:04.234 --> 03:05.868
And my husband, um...

03:05.868 --> 03:06.868
Um...

Barry?

03:07.934 --> 03:09.300
That's it.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.834
I can never think
of his name.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.167
Ah!

03:14.167 --> 03:18.067
Oh!
Oh!
Ooh!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.501
It's amazing what
energy they have

03:19.501 --> 03:21.000
when they're
leaving the house.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.634
But not for us.

You marry them,
they forget you're a woman.

03:29.534 --> 03:32.634

I do my best.

03:32.634 --> 03:35.367
Peggy, you get it
once a month.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.734
What's your secret?

03:37.734 --> 03:40.167
Well, I'll tell you,

03:40.167 --> 03:42.067
you have to catch
them off guard.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.701
For instance, I'll tell Al

03:43.701 --> 03:46.634
that I'm going to take
a shower before going to bed.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.234
Then I'll go
and turn on the shower,

03:48.234 --> 03:50.033
and Al will hurry up
and get into bed

03:50.033 --> 03:53.234
and pretend to fall asleep
before I get out.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.968
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.000
Actually, though,
I'm hiding in the darkened room,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
and I grab him
just as he hits the mattress.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.501
Sure, sometimes,
there's a fight,

04:02.501 --> 04:05.000
but in the end, it gave us
two beautiful children.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.501
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

04:08.100 --> 04:09.901
I can't understand it.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.334
Our husbands don't want
to sleep with us anymore.

04:12.334 --> 04:14.367
Why?

04:18.634 --> 04:24.367
Maybe he's afraid
he'll wake up in your stomach.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.267
Must he be here?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.367
I'm going. I'm going.

04:43.968 --> 04:48.868
Good God, it calls them
from everywhere.

04:48.868 --> 04:50.234
Hi, Peg.

04:50.234 --> 04:52.634
Sorry to interrupt, girls,
but I'm in a hurry.

04:52.634 --> 04:55.367
Steve and I have
sort of a date planned tonight.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.901
He's meeting me
at a sleazy bar

04:56.901 --> 04:59.133
where he's going to
"pick me up."

04:59.133 --> 05:00.734
Can I borrow a cigarette?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.000
Steve just loves it

05:02.000 --> 05:04.934
when I smoke
and look like trash.

05:04.934 --> 05:05.968
Sure.
Thanks.

05:05.968 --> 05:07.734
Excuse me,
but if you're married,

05:07.734 --> 05:10.501
why are you going out?

05:10.501 --> 05:12.000
We're role playing.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.868
It adds mystery and excitement
to our love life.

05:14.868 --> 05:16.501
With your husband?

05:16.501 --> 05:18.567
How much
of a love life?

05:18.567 --> 05:21.167
Every 36 hours.

05:21.167 --> 05:24.067
Except on weekends
when we catch up.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.033
Give us some
cigarettes, Peggy.

05:26.033 --> 05:30.868
Yeah. Let's go to the bowling
alley and turn on our men!

05:40.067 --> 05:42.334
Al, what are you doing
home so early?

05:42.334 --> 05:44.234
Peg, you should have seen it.

05:44.234 --> 05:47.767
There was a riot at the alley.

05:47.767 --> 05:48.801
Your friends showed up

05:48.801 --> 05:50.968
stinking of chocolate
and cigarettes.

05:50.968 --> 05:53.901
They started yelling,
"Take me, I'm trash!"

05:56.667 --> 05:58.067
Nobody did.

05:58.067 --> 06:01.000
But then the riot started.
It was ugly, Peg--

06:01.000 --> 06:04.334
men screaming,
running for the exits.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.033
I didn't quite understand
what they were saying,

06:10.033 --> 06:14.033
but I think something big's
happening in 36 hours.

06:14.033 --> 06:15.968
Do we have
any canned goods, Peg?

06:15.968 --> 06:17.801
This could be it.

06:17.801 --> 06:19.434
Sit down, Al.

06:19.434 --> 06:21.501
Did you hear something
on the news?

06:21.501 --> 06:23.601
Yes, as a matter of fact.

06:23.601 --> 06:26.033
They said that the sun
was going to supernova

06:26.033 --> 06:28.267
and we should have sex
before the end comes.

06:28.267 --> 06:30.367
I got no time, Peg.
I got to go looting!

06:30.367 --> 06:33.868
Forget it, Al.
I'm only kidding.

06:33.868 --> 06:35.501
Look, unlike you,

06:35.501 --> 06:38.400
the sun will be up
tomorrow morning.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.767
Look, the girls
were just lonely.

06:42.767 --> 06:44.934
They wanted some affection
from their husbands.

06:44.934 --> 06:47.067
On league night?

06:47.067 --> 06:48.968
Never mind, Al.

06:48.968 --> 06:51.901
I'm going to go upstairs
and take a shower.

06:51.901 --> 06:53.100
Oh, yeah! I'm sure you're

06:53.100 --> 06:54.767
really going to get me
with that one twice.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.901
Dad!

06:59.901 --> 07:03.767
No, it's
not that, Dad.

07:03.767 --> 07:05.501
Remember how you
always say it's important

07:05.501 --> 07:06.901
to do nice things
for other people?

07:06.901 --> 07:08.634
I never say that, son.

07:08.634 --> 07:11.501
Then it must have
been you, Mom.

07:11.501 --> 07:14.434
No, I don't think
it was me.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.267
Must have been Cosby then.

07:17.267 --> 07:20.667
Anyhow, me and my friends
were down in the park,

07:20.667 --> 07:22.634
heckling some bums,
and I met this girl.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.133
and she has
no place to stay,

07:24.133 --> 07:25.133
so I invited her here.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.000
Is that okay?

07:27.567 --> 07:29.734
No.

07:29.734 --> 07:32.234
Al, the girl
has no place to stay,

07:32.234 --> 07:34.100
and I'm sure
after one night with you,

07:34.100 --> 07:36.634
it will send her
screaming back to her parents.

07:36.634 --> 07:38.367
Of course, she can stay.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.567
Thanks, Mom.
She's right outside.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.267
Just until
we find her parents.

07:42.267 --> 07:44.267
This is great.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.501
I barely want my own,

07:45.501 --> 07:47.000
now I get another
runny-nosed--

07:52.267 --> 07:57.434
Mom, Dad,
this is Tiffany.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.834
Welcome home, Tiff.

08:09.968 --> 08:12.567
Al, this is not
what I expected.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.601
Peg, this is not
a present for you.

08:15.601 --> 08:17.300
It's for Dad...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.100
From his little boy!

08:22.100 --> 08:26.100
Tiffany, come in.
Relax. Sit down.

08:26.100 --> 08:29.467
You want anything,
like coffee, water--

08:29.467 --> 08:31.934
An old man
drooling on you.

08:31.934 --> 08:33.667
This is Peg.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.601
This is probably
the last time you'll see her.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.433
Peg, this must
be boring you.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.734
Bud, take your mom
to the movies.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.967
Let her go by herself, Dad.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.734
I found her.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.767
So, uh, Tiffany...

08:47.767 --> 08:49.734
Tell us a little
something about yourself.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.367
What Peg means is
where are you from,

08:52.367 --> 08:53.634
what are your plans?

08:53.634 --> 08:56.634
When did you stop
wearing a bra?

08:56.634 --> 08:58.300
Well, I'm from
San Francisco,

08:58.300 --> 08:59.300
and I'm on my way

08:59.300 --> 09:01.234
to New York
to go to art school.

09:01.234 --> 09:02.734
And I don't like bras.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.801
They're too constricting,
don't you think?

09:04.801 --> 09:06.033
Get out.

09:08.868 --> 09:11.667
Peg, she's got
no place to go.

09:11.667 --> 09:14.267
Bud, get some sheets
and a blanket for the couch

09:14.267 --> 09:16.834
so your mother
will be comfortable.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.400
No, no... I meant
so Tiffany can be comfortable.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.334
It's so easy to get
you two confused.

09:25.334 --> 09:26.367
You sure it's okay?

09:26.367 --> 09:27.868
Positive.
No!
Definitely.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.567
Thank you.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.834
I'll just change
for bed, then.

09:38.067 --> 09:39.567
Isn't that cute, Peg?

09:39.567 --> 09:40.567
She's...

09:40.567 --> 09:42.300
walking.

09:46.801 --> 09:49.868
Al, will you put down
Tiffany's sweater?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.267
You know, Peg,

09:54.267 --> 09:57.133
her sweater
smells like sunshine.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.934
Well, I'll tell you what, Al,

09:58.934 --> 10:01.033
why don't we put it
with your shirts?

10:01.033 --> 10:03.267
What with the moons
under your arms

10:03.267 --> 10:04.901
and her sunshine,

10:04.901 --> 10:07.234
we'll have a whole galaxy.

10:09.534 --> 10:11.167
Mr. and Mrs. Bundy,

10:11.167 --> 10:12.534
I can't
thank you enough

10:12.534 --> 10:14.734
for letting me
stay here with you.

10:14.734 --> 10:16.767
No, you can't.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.100
Give her a chance, Peg.
She may.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.534
She did.

10:27.734 --> 10:30.567
Can you teach Peg
to do that?

10:30.567 --> 10:32.667
I don't think
she'll have time, Al.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.033
She's leaving tomorrow...

10:34.033 --> 10:35.701
Early.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.267
Well, I'm going up to bed.

10:38.267 --> 10:40.133
I don't suppose
you'd want to join me.

10:43.968 --> 10:45.434
Yeah.

10:45.434 --> 10:46.534
Yes?

10:46.534 --> 10:51.434
Oh, yeah. Now.
Right now.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.000
Stay!

11:12.234 --> 11:15.634
AL: Peg, you want to
come back up?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.534
Forever.

11:17.534 --> 11:19.400
Coming, Al!

11:27.901 --> 11:29.000
Hey, guys.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.601
Thanks for helping me out
in the yard.

11:30.601 --> 11:31.601
Glad to help out.

11:31.601 --> 11:32.801
No problem.

11:32.801 --> 11:34.400
Nice guy like you.

11:37.501 --> 11:40.100
I hope my aerobics
didn't disturb your yard work.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.567
No.
Didn't even
notice you.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.434
I'll just go
wash up, then.

11:46.667 --> 11:50.133
Thanks, Al.

11:50.133 --> 11:52.567
Well, I hear
Louise calling.

11:52.567 --> 11:55.067
Yeah, Sheila's
always ready.

11:55.067 --> 11:59.767

to rush right over,

something upstairs

some jogging.
