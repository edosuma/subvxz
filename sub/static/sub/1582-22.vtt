take my action to Willie.

05:28.804 --> 05:30.605

where no one can see.

05:30.639 --> 05:32.974
When Milhouse gets there,
you know what to do.

05:33.008 --> 05:35.076
Oh, yeah. Totally.

05:35.110 --> 05:37.111
I mean, it's so obvious.

05:37.146 --> 05:38.480
Just punch him!

05:38.514 --> 05:40.014
Exactly.

05:40.049 --> 05:43.318

And what does he have
to jump over?

05:51.360 --> 05:52.694
Nothing, that's what.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.186
<i>and no one was a bigger hero</i>

09:25.220 --> 09:26.854
<i>than the magical little man</i>

09:26.888 --> 09:27.888
<i>behind the controls.</i>

09:27.923 --> 09:29.390
(fireworks whistling)

09:29.424 --> 09:30.958
Are you God?

09:30.992 --> 09:32.793
No, no.

09:32.828 --> 09:36.330
But I shoot rockets
into his a-face.

09:36.364 --> 09:37.865
Here's-a my card.

09:37.899 --> 09:41.502
Don't forget to treasure it.

09:41.536 --> 09:43.471
Hmm.

09:43.505 --> 09:44.672
Now let's see.

09:44.706 --> 09:46.373
Which pants have that card?

09:46.408 --> 09:48.309
Board shorts, interested shorts.

09:48.343 --> 09:50.845
Here we are.

09:50.879 --> 09:52.780
Kaboom.

09:54.282 --> 09:57.017
Giuseppe, I want you
to come out of retirement

09:57.052 --> 10:00.020
for the greatest fireworks show
of your career.

10:00.055 --> 10:03.057
Why do you come here and remind
me of a time in my life

10:03.091 --> 10:06.827
when I made a-tons of money
doing a-what I love?

10:06.862 --> 10:09.230
If the <i>Expendables</i> movies
have taught us anything,

10:09.264 --> 10:11.432
it's that people
do their best work

10:11.466 --> 10:13.834
after they're old
and forgotten.

10:13.869 --> 10:17.772
Well, I am younger
than Sylvester Stallone.

10:17.806 --> 10:19.640
I will do it!

10:23.779 --> 10:25.079
Hey, buddy.

10:25.113 --> 10:27.681
Bart, my truest friend.

10:27.716 --> 10:29.150
I brought you a cake.

10:29.184 --> 10:30.718
Read it.

10:30.752 --> 10:32.620
That's an odd message.

10:32.654 --> 10:34.789
But who am I to
argue with icing?

10:34.823 --> 10:37.758
Will you watch <i>Cassidy</i>
<i>the Crocodile</i> with me?

10:37.793 --> 10:40.528
Um, that's kind
of a baby show.

10:40.562 --> 10:42.196
It's all I can handle now.

10:42.230 --> 10:45.599
(sighs)

10:45.634 --> 10:47.134
Henrietta Kitten?

10:47.169 --> 10:48.769
Will you marry me?

10:48.804 --> 10:50.771
Meow, meow, maybe.

10:50.806 --> 10:52.439
Why would a kitten
marry a crocodile?

10:52.474 --> 10:53.741
Wouldn't it eat her?

10:53.775 --> 10:54.875
(shushes)

10:54.910 --> 10:57.311
Suspension of disbelief.

10:57.345 --> 11:00.147
Friends help
friends in trouble.

11:00.182 --> 11:01.148
No! Turn it off!

11:01.183 --> 11:02.883
It's too intense for me!

11:02.918 --> 11:06.387
Some guys just can't
handle crocodiles.

11:06.421 --> 11:07.922
Is it over yet?

11:07.956 --> 11:09.256
(chicken clucks)

11:09.291 --> 11:10.457
And if you're dissatisfied

11:10.492 --> 11:11.892
for any reason,

11:11.927 --> 11:13.594
I will refund your money

11:13.628 --> 11:15.763
in the form of acorns.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.067
(groans)

11:20.101 --> 11:23.771
Hey, this gunpowder,
it has a-crystal meth in it.

11:23.805 --> 11:25.573
Crystal meth?
Then what the heck

11:25.607 --> 11:28.342
did I sell
to them Colombian drug lords?

11:29.644 --> 11:30.978
Brandine!

11:31.012 --> 11:33.914
We're feuding
with the Escobars again!

11:33.949 --> 11:36.617
Does that mean
I ain't talking to Maria?

11:36.651 --> 11:38.452
Duh! Yes.

11:38.486 --> 11:39.520
Homer, we will get

11:39.554 --> 11:42.523
the fireworks someplace else.

11:42.557 --> 11:45.860
The pig's been eating
the C-4 blocks again!

11:45.894 --> 11:48.028
(burps)

11:48.063 --> 11:50.364
(dog barks)

11:50.398 --> 11:54.301
We've invited a new athlete to
join our do-gooding dream team.

11:54.336 --> 11:57.538
Please welcome fleet-footed
phenom, Bart Simpson.

11:57.572 --> 12:00.341
(crowd cheering)

12:00.375 --> 12:02.343
Hey, everyone.
I sure got a lot of attention

12:02.377 --> 12:04.545
for winning this year's
Race around the School.

12:04.579 --> 12:06.380
(crowd cheering)

12:06.414 --> 12:08.315
Completely deserved!

12:08.350 --> 12:09.783
Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel.

12:09.818 --> 12:12.219
But I am not here
to talk about myself.

12:12.254 --> 12:15.155
Milhouse, would you
join me at the podium?

12:15.190 --> 12:16.156
(clamoring)

12:16.191 --> 12:17.224
What's going on?

12:17.259 --> 12:18.792
Seriously, what-what's
transpiring?

12:18.827 --> 12:20.494
I've got to set things straight.

12:20.528 --> 12:22.997
During that same race, my friend
Milhouse was in the lead,

12:23.031 --> 12:25.666
when something
horrible happened!

12:27.369 --> 12:29.203
LISA:
<i>Bart knew the worst thing to do</i>

12:29.237 --> 12:31.372
<i>was pile lie upon lie.</i>

12:31.406 --> 12:33.407
<i>And that's exactly what he did.</i>

12:33.441 --> 12:34.909
Rather than try to figure
out what happened,

12:34.943 --> 12:36.477
Milhouse had the
courage to move on.

12:36.511 --> 12:38.312
To me, that's a hero.

12:38.346 --> 12:39.680
(crowd cheering)

12:39.714 --> 12:41.148
Nicely done.

12:41.182 --> 12:43.183
Now we will give out
free rubber bracelets.

12:43.218 --> 12:44.818
Do not wear them to bed.

12:44.853 --> 12:46.220
They smell like truck tires.

12:46.254 --> 12:47.421
They're disgusting.

12:51.559 --> 12:52.993
Crotch or forehead?

12:53.028 --> 12:55.195
Uh, forehead for once.

12:55.230 --> 12:57.598
Wha...?

13:08.209 --> 13:10.377
Bart Simpson!

13:10.412 --> 13:13.180
You ran away
when I was getting beat up!

13:13.214 --> 13:14.515
(crowd booing)

13:14.549 --> 13:15.749
Bart's a coward!

13:15.784 --> 13:16.951
He lied to us!

13:16.985 --> 13:19.420
Stop the tattoo!

13:19.454 --> 13:22.256
Uh, I could make it
a bag of groceries.

13:22.290 --> 13:24.391
All right, make sure there's
some French bread sticking out.

13:24.426 --> 13:27.428
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

13:32.216 --> 13:34.384
[](crowd rabbling)

13:34.418 --> 13:37.287
Look how he runs now!

13:37.321 --> 13:38.955
LISA: <i>So Bart was revealed</i>
<i>as a coward.</i>

13:38.989 --> 13:42.191
<i>And now it seemed</i>
<i>like the whole world</i>

13:42.226 --> 13:43.860
<i>was against him.</i>

13:43.894 --> 13:44.861
(screams)

13:44.895 --> 13:47.030
(panting)

13:47.064 --> 13:49.365
MALE ANNOUNCER: Have you ever considered
a reverse-equity mortgage?

13:49.400 --> 13:51.401
That's what put
me in this dump!

13:51.435 --> 13:54.237
Grampa, everyone's
calling me a coward.

13:54.271 --> 13:56.105
Well, join the club.

13:56.140 --> 13:59.609
Anyone who makes it to old age
has got to be part-coward.

13:59.643 --> 14:01.945
Come on, you were
in World War II.

14:01.979 --> 14:04.347
Do you know
how I survived D-Day?

14:05.382 --> 14:07.317
(retches)

14:07.351 --> 14:09.786
Don't worry--
just a day at the beach.

14:13.991 --> 14:17.727
I'll be back around 1946!

14:17.761 --> 14:19.829
But don't people hate cowards?

14:19.863 --> 14:20.897
Sure do.

14:20.931 --> 14:22.665
But we outlive the brave.

14:22.700 --> 14:26.302
Leaving us cowards to make time
with the heroes' widows.

14:26.337 --> 14:29.205
After Korea,
I was drowning in boobies.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.774
Wow, that sounds pretty sweet.

14:31.809 --> 14:33.576
Well, there is a price.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.779
Do you wake up sweating
in the middle of the night?

14:36.814 --> 14:37.780
Yes.

14:37.815 --> 14:39.115
So do I.

14:39.149 --> 14:40.249
But I get back to sleep

14:40.284 --> 14:42.051
by counting the men I let down.

14:42.086 --> 14:44.621
There's Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn,

14:44.655 --> 14:48.558
the O'Donnell boys,
the lost ship PT-108,

14:48.592 --> 14:50.560
the Poor Buggers
of Meatloaf Ridge,

14:50.594 --> 14:52.228
the Andrew sisters...

14:52.262 --> 14:54.163
(snoring)

14:57.267 --> 14:59.268
(gasps)

15:02.873 --> 15:04.007
I understand.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.509
You have standards.

15:06.543 --> 15:08.678
(gasps)

15:08.712 --> 15:11.147
This is an angry sleepover.

15:11.181 --> 15:13.883
I'm only doing it
'cause it was on the books.

15:15.152 --> 15:16.233
LISA
<i>While Bart was in hell,</i>

15:16.253 --> 15:17.553
<i>Homer was happily surrounded</i>

15:17.588 --> 15:19.756
<i>by fire and brimstone.</i>

15:19.790 --> 15:23.459
Okay, let's make some fireworks.

15:23.494 --> 15:25.828
Now drive slowly
and a-carefully

15:25.863 --> 15:27.797
to my workshop.

15:27.831 --> 15:31.034
It's in-a the Cobblestone
a-District.

15:34.705 --> 15:36.873
Oh, thank God--
a rickety bridge.

15:41.478 --> 15:42.979
Don't worry.

15:43.013 --> 15:46.049
We'll be safe
in the Gas a-Lamp a-District.

15:48.485 --> 15:50.887
(tires screeching)

15:55.893 --> 15:58.027
("Stars and Stripes Forever"
playing)

16:13.043 --> 16:14.177
Can I pitch something?

16:14.211 --> 16:15.278
Go ahead.

16:15.312 --> 16:16.779
Boom! Biddy bom-bom boom!

16:16.814 --> 16:18.614
Biddy bom bow! Ba-dip-boo!

16:18.649 --> 16:20.016
Boom! Boom!

16:20.050 --> 16:22.819
That's-a nice.
