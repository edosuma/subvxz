<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.442
<i>"For life."</i>

01:16.444 --> 01:19.745
<i>No one wants anything
"for life."</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:23.382
<i>It just reminds us
of our impending death.</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:27.119
I pledge allegiance...

01:27.121 --> 01:31.423
<i>The etymology of the word "betroth"
comes from the word "pledge."</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:35.260
<i>Americans pledge allegiance a
myriad of times during their life</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:37.930
<i>and then proceed to throw a
happy meal out the car window.</i>

01:37.932 --> 01:41.900
<i>"Betroth" is a word
from the 1500s.</i>

01:41.902 --> 01:44.937
<i>I mean, the bloody Ming dynasty
was still around.</i>

01:44.939 --> 01:47.606
<i>Our problem is,
we live too long.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:50.476
<i>I mean, if we were all dying at
45, then fine, yeah, of course.</i>

01:50.478 --> 01:52.244
<i>Go get yourself betrothed.</i>

01:57.418 --> 02:00.719
<i>But now we insist on doing
Pilates colonic retreats</i>

02:00.721 --> 02:02.387
<i>and vitamin drips,</i>

02:02.389 --> 02:05.390
<i>convicting ourselves
to a dreadfully long existence</i>

02:05.392 --> 02:08.759
<i>with one partner
for half a bloody century.</i>

02:08.762 --> 02:11.563
<i>What do we do,
collectively as a species?</i>

02:11.565 --> 02:15.400
<i>Die younger or,
a far less painful fate,</i>

02:15.402 --> 02:17.436
<i>rethink the system.</i>

02:17.438 --> 02:19.238
<i>I choose life.</i>

02:19.240 --> 02:22.508
I hate that he died. They
were kind of a cute couple.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.676
Yeah.
You know?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.745
At least one of them
got out of it alive.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.580
Shh.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.916
Thank you, Janet.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.317
Who was that?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.419
And now Hamish's
first and second wives

02:34.421 --> 02:38.290
will read the lyrics to "come
away with me" by Norah Jones.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.992
Excuse me.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.427
So, what is the point?

02:42.429 --> 02:45.998
Children? Sure.
We marry to procreate.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.002
Yet these precious progeny are the very
reason for your marriage's demise.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.703
Money? Of course.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.772
It's cheaper to conjoin funds,

02:53.774 --> 02:57.976
cohabit, joint Costco cards,
tax breaks.

02:57.978 --> 03:02.514
Yet still, finances are the
number-one culprit for severed vows.

03:03.816 --> 03:04.917
Cruel business.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.486
What else then?

03:07.488 --> 03:10.122
Definitely not the sex.

03:10.124 --> 03:11.557
Companionship?

03:12.358 --> 03:15.260
Boredom? Religion?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.763
And then there's love.

03:18.831 --> 03:21.133
We marry for love?

03:21.135 --> 03:22.868
Don't be daft.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.505
Love is not sustainable.
Nor is marriage.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.407
Oh. Mel.
Somebody over there.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.079
Hi.
Hello.

03:34.081 --> 03:38.417
Um, I have two questions,
uh, for you.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.352
Um...
Speak up a little.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.854
Um, the first question is,

03:42.856 --> 03:47.859
why did you choose Vero beach,
uh, to make your project?

03:47.861 --> 03:53.699
Um, and "B" is, uh, I loved
your film <i> tween jungle</i> so much,

03:53.701 --> 03:57.502
and I just, uh, admire that you
dedicated your life to the arts.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.004
Both great questions.
Thank you.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.707
Uh, why Vero?

04:01.709 --> 04:04.910
Well, my new project will delve
into the social theorems

04:04.912 --> 04:07.112
presented to amend the
architecture of marriage,

04:07.114 --> 04:11.049
that it should be a seven-year
contract with an option to renew,

04:11.051 --> 04:14.052
and that's what I'm gonna be
concentrating on here in Florida,

04:14.054 --> 04:15.754
the divorce capital of America.

04:15.756 --> 04:21.360
So, you proud inhabitants
of this swinging state,

04:21.362 --> 04:24.630
I am going to get down
on one knee and propose,

04:24.632 --> 04:28.300
will you accept
that marriage is dead?

04:28.302 --> 04:32.704
I'm not actually going to get down on
one knee. That was a sort of metaphor.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.307
Oh, Noah, how can you
not remember?

04:35.309 --> 04:37.442
It was the woman,
Vivian Prudeck.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.612
She's the one who did that amazing
documentary, <i>tween jungle.</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:43.548
And there was that one scene
with all those baboons

04:43.550 --> 04:46.652
dancing all angsty to Nirvana.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.588
I'll never forget that image. Guess
who jumped ship, by the way?

04:49.590 --> 04:52.758
Moses Wolper,
my own goddamn godfather,

04:52.760 --> 04:57.262
prefers crappy prefab bullshit
from rightnowblinds.Com.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.298
Anyway, it's just
incredible... unbelievable.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.900
That she's coming to Vero.
Where's the loyalty?

05:01.902 --> 05:04.236
You should've seen her speech.
She was so riveting.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.638
Really. She commanded
this whole audience.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.807
She was funny and charismatic.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.177
She's looking for couples for her
new... I'm sorry. Who's doing what?

05:12.179 --> 05:15.781
You are not serious, are you? You're
not listening to me at all, are you?

05:15.783 --> 05:19.584
Oh, dear. Is there another leak?
Yeah. Of course there is.

05:19.586 --> 05:22.921
But at least we get our plants watered
instead of ruining the goddamn carpet.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.924
Why don't we just call the
Sorensen's kid to fix the roof?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.427
We can't do that. Why not?
You still don't trust him?

05:28.429 --> 05:31.797
He was 13 when he drove the
lawn mower into the river.

05:31.799 --> 05:36.034
No, I forgave him for that. It's just, it's
800 bucks, and we don't have that. Okay?

05:37.136 --> 05:39.638
We need to do a standard line.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.476
Doing a standard line
is not gonna change the

05:41.488 --> 05:43.175
fact that rightnowblinds.
Com is so easy.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.210
Who's side are you on?
I-I'm sorry.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.846
We're basically broke.
We gotta get creative.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.948
Listen. I have an idea. Yeah?

05:49.950 --> 05:52.284
Yeah.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.986
I think we need to
change our slogan. No.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.223
Listen. Just hear me out. I
like "blindful thinking."

05:58.225 --> 06:01.493
It's got a nice ring to... it was
dad's thing. Honey, I know that.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.296
I just... I have some really
great ideas, I think,

06:04.298 --> 06:07.065
'cause I think we can make
it a little more modern.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.834
So just hear me out. Okay.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.902
Um...

06:10.904 --> 06:12.404
Blinded by the light.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.340
What about that?
Mmm.

06:15.342 --> 06:19.077
We don't <i> blind</i> people. That would be bad.
No. It was sort of cool.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.314
Um, what about, uh,
blinders keepers?

06:22.316 --> 06:24.983
Okay. Okay, so... you
don't like that one.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.319
But, uh... who's
blind is it anyway?

06:27.321 --> 06:31.056
Come on. Is that modern? I think
it's kinda groovy and cool.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.925
I'll write them down so that
you can really see them.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.094
It's sometimes easier
to see it visually.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.097
You know what you should do?
Blind your own business.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.000
- Oh, that's good. No, that's not good.
- Don't write that down.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.535
"Blind your own business."

06:43.537 --> 06:45.504
When you see it written
it looks quite good.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.907
You are ovulating.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.642
What is that?
It's an app.

06:51.844 --> 06:52.944
Wha... it...

06:52.946 --> 06:55.714
See, the green days
are "fertile."

06:55.716 --> 06:59.184
You have an... you have an app
on your phone for my ovaries?

06:59.186 --> 07:02.053
Um... well, yeah.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.522
It's pretty cool, right?

07:05.458 --> 07:06.758
So...
Oh.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.260
Um...

07:08.262 --> 07:10.729
Maybe...

07:10.731 --> 07:12.964
Well... I see.
Oh, um...

07:14.467 --> 07:17.369
I do have to pee, so I
might be able to come.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.237
Just for fun.
Yeah.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.072
Um...
Can I smell your breath?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.941
Oh, Noah, please don't
make me do that.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.309
Come on. Come on.

07:27.414 --> 07:31.283
God, I love the way your breath
smells after you work out.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.218
Oh, don't say that.

07:33.220 --> 07:37.055
That just reminds me of our "be more
active to improve our sex life" talk.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.057
That really makes me
self-conscious.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.059
Because I'm doing my best.
I know.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.061
I just lack
hand-eye coordination.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.096
I did the tennis clinic today.
No.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.599
Listen, you are very good
at hacky sack.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.668
You're just saying that.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.537
Hey.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.007
Meet me in the bathroom...

07:57.009 --> 07:58.810
In five.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.178
Okay?

08:13.793 --> 08:16.895
Don't know if I need fi-five
minutes to get there, hon.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.099
W-watch it. Watch it. Noah?
That actually hurt.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.035
Oh. Turn around. Put your right leg up.
Just be gentle.

08:24.037 --> 08:28.139
Oh, no! Poo, poo, poo.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.208
Oh, gosh, who doesn't...

08:30.210 --> 08:34.212
Who doesn't flush after taking a
number two? That's unreasonable.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.548
I'm sorry.
I just... I thought...

08:39.553 --> 08:41.186
There we go.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.325
No, there's poo in there.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.528
Well, it's a toilet.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.699
I know. I just...

08:54.701 --> 08:58.637
I just don't want to bring
life into this world over poo.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.872
<i>Beans on toast.</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:02.073
<i>Convention.</i>

09:03.142 --> 09:05.076
<i>Man meets woman.</i>

09:05.078 --> 09:06.411
<i>Convention.</i>

09:07.713 --> 09:09.581
<i>Tweens hating their parents.</i>

09:09.583 --> 09:11.449
<i>Convention.</i>
You're so annoying!

09:14.487 --> 09:17.822
<i>Follow the fearless journey of
four species, four adolescents,</i>

09:17.824 --> 09:20.292
<i>four hemispheres of the earth
in the...</i>

09:21.494 --> 09:24.095
Tween jungle.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.897
Why would you do that, Mel?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.533
That's quite an aggressive act,
stapling my face like that.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.536
Sorry. If I don't eat something
soon, I am gonna murder someone.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.439
And given your proximity, it's
in your interest to help me.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.242
We are in front of a diner.
Oh, yes! Well done, Mel.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.077
Might have a shandy tonight
after all.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.947
Oh! That bastard!

09:41.949 --> 09:44.683
Breathe in the light, Viv.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.785
Breathe in the light.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.887
I don't really want
to speak to you anymore.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.089
<i>I think about you all the time.
</i> Well, that's rich.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.793
Considering <i> you</i> disposed of <i> me</i> like a
rain-drenched newspaper in a ditch of shit.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.562
<i>Stop yelling, please.</i> Don't
order me around, Richard.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.632
Is she there, the horse-training munter?
<i>Name's Pippa.</i>

10:00.634 --> 10:03.635
Oh, no, sorry. The equestrian wrangler.
Don't answer that.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.871
<i>I want you to come home. I miss you.</i>
Well, I don't care!

10:06.873 --> 10:09.574
<i>I think you do.</i> No, I don't give a toss.
And neither do you.

10:09.576 --> 10:13.278
<i>How's the project going?</i> It's
going very well, actually.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.880
<i>Is it then? Is that a lighter I hear?
You're not smoking?</i>

10:15.882 --> 10:17.983
No, I'm not smoking. <i>I
can hear you smoking.</i>

10:17.985 --> 10:21.586
<i>It's not good for your face.</i> Currently
I've got too many couples to choose from.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.956
<i>Is that right? Okay. Good for you, girl.</i>
No, it's good. It's therapeutic.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.926
<i>Is it then?</i> All these
strangers reminding me

10:27.928 --> 10:30.962
why you're so fucking
predictable!

10:32.298 --> 10:33.932
How's Richard?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.667
He sounds really well, actually.

10:37.436 --> 10:41.272
1.4 is more
than reasonable. Period.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.908
After all, comma,

10:43.910 --> 10:47.112
won't it feel great
to finally get rid of

10:47.114 --> 10:52.083
that gator-infested
property... question mark.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.486
Again, comma, so...

10:54.488 --> 10:59.124
Sorry about your bichon frise.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.961
Exclamation point. Must
have been a horrific sight.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.431
Exclamation point.
Exclamation <i> point.</i>

11:08.201 --> 11:10.435
Um, if you wou...

11:12.538 --> 11:13.738
Ah.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.681
Hi.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.318
Mmm-mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm-mmm.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.787
Is it too sexy?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.622
Almost too sexy.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.625
Harvey, am I a gay man in
the '60s looking to bone?

11:33.627 --> 11:35.994
- All right, fine.
- I mean, come on.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.631
You know what? You wanna be a
goddamn pill, be a goddamn pill.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.467
I'd rather take one than be one.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.071
What?
What did you just say?

11:48.407 --> 11:50.508
I said I'd rather
take one than be one.

11:50.510 --> 11:55.313
Why does everything gotta be
a quip, a little dig?

11:55.315 --> 11:58.016
It's... it's... it's unpleasant.
I'll tell you that.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.822
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm,
mmm-mmm-mmm.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.858
Oh, my god, please. Are you going
to take the helmet off for dinner?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.994
I don't know.
Is it safe?

12:09.996 --> 12:13.064
What? I don't know if
it's safe to take it off.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.667
Because I feel like... we're in
a fricking restaurant, Harvey.

12:15.669 --> 12:19.337
Danger zone here. I might need
it for some sort of protection.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.373
Well, just so you know, you
do look mentally challenged.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.709
Well, that's fine. Because you know what?
It's the opposite of sexy.

12:24.711 --> 12:28.012
Being married to you is
challenging in so many ways...

12:28.014 --> 12:29.714
Mentally, emotionally,
physically...

12:29.716 --> 12:32.517
That, to me, it seems fitting

12:32.519 --> 12:35.587
that I would look challenged,
sitting here with you.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.555
- Mmm, I'm sure.
- Okay.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.891
I am gonna take a leak.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.826
Order me the French dip.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.134
Hello. I'm so sorry
to bother you.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.636
Two French dips,
side, creamed spinach...

12:51.638 --> 12:54.105
- No, I'm not a waitress.
- Okay, well, I'm broke.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.046
And I'm not interested
in what you're selling.

12:56.071 --> 12:57.408
I'm not soliciting anything.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.078
Okay, well, I don't think
<i>you</i> think I'm a hooker,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.847
unless you're an idiot
or a very hopeful lesbian.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.583
Oh... oh, god.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.452
I didn't know you were lesbians.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.254
No, no, we're not lesbians,
nor hopefuls.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.456
Well, actually, she is.
I'm not.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.892
- Hi. I'm Vivian Prudeck.
- Hello.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.628
I'm in the area making a
documentary for BBC films

13:16.630 --> 13:18.429
about the concept
that marriage...

13:18.431 --> 13:20.899
How much? Should be a contract
that expires after seven years...

13:20.901 --> 13:22.600
Married 31.
How much?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.335
Well,
it's quite a modest budget.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.070
But it's more the cachet
of participa...

13:26.072 --> 13:28.273
20k, five percent.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.109
3,000, two percent,
and that is more than generous.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.678
Seventeen and three, and I'll
throw in some domestic abuse.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.848
Four and 2.5, and that's my final
offer, with the domestic abuse.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.516
Twelve and four,

13:38.518 --> 13:41.319
and I'll give you a trial
separation at some point mid-shoot.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.416
You're bluffing.

13:42.428 --> 13:45.256
Bluffing is for children.
Don't insult me.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.494
I'll give you 10,000
and three percent

13:49.496 --> 13:51.496
if you deliver all of the above

13:51.498 --> 13:55.133
<i>and...</i> Divorce papers.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.554
<i>You've been listening
to widespread panic radio.</i>

14:18.023 --> 14:19.991
<i>To build your custom blinds,</i>

14:19.993 --> 14:22.060
<i>say "yes" to
rightnowblinds.Com.</i>

14:22.062 --> 14:25.063
<i>It's just seamless and easy.</i>

14:25.065 --> 14:27.332
There it is.
What's wrong?

14:33.239 --> 14:36.307
Our accountant says
we have to file.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.842
For what?

14:37.844 --> 14:40.545
Uh, for chapter 13.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.413
So, uh...
But don't worry.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.749
Lenny says
it's just to reorganize

14:44.751 --> 14:47.252
so we don't have to
lose the house.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.320
Lose the house? What? Yeah.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.489
No, that's...
That's crazy.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.858
I mean, i...

14:53.860 --> 14:55.927
I didn't know it was that bad.
Yeah, well...

14:55.929 --> 14:58.529
Why didn't...
I-i-it is what it is.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.865
My god!
I mean, Jesus!

15:00.867 --> 15:03.768
Gosh, Noah! God, I really
think that's unfair.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.571
I wish you would
have told me. I...

15:06.573 --> 15:09.240
Well, don't panic. I'm panicking.
I <i> should</i> panic.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.376
I feel sick.
I feel really warm.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.279
The bankruptcy is to protect us
from further credit issues.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.347
Oh, my god!
It's just to reorganize.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.550
We can't bring a child... you're talking
about bringing a child into poverty?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.119
Thank you.
No, thank you.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.254
One thing at a time.
Okay.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.457
My god, I feel so frivolous.
I got my hair done today.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.927
You can get your hair done.
What was it, 30, 40 bucks?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.762
No, it was, like, $120.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.130
What?
Yeah!

15:32.132 --> 15:34.699
What did they even do?
It looks the same.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.535
It's low-lights.
It's a... whole thing.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.737
It's like highlights. You
know highlights. Sure.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.307
So it's like that,
but it just...

15:42.309 --> 15:46.110
The whole point of it is that you don't
really notice. It's very subtle.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.112
But there's a gleam.
Jesus.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.415
Then... then yes. Okay? Yes?

15:50.417 --> 15:55.653
How about no hair treatments that cost over
a hundred bucks and result in nothing?

15:55.655 --> 15:59.057
Gleam? How does hair gleam? Yeah, it was
a bad call. I just didn't realize...

16:00.459 --> 16:02.026
Where we were.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.938
Huh?

16:13.940 --> 16:16.307
Mmm, o-okay.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.243
Hi.
Is that foreplay?

16:19.245 --> 16:22.113
'Cause I feel like I
missed something crucial.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.683
Well, you were all ready
before, and so I was just...

16:25.685 --> 16:28.252
Just feel like we need
to connect, so i...

16:28.254 --> 16:31.589
Yeah, well, it just... hi.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.858
Hi. Um...

16:33.860 --> 16:35.660
No, I mean, I appreciate it.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.262
I-I-i just didn't know
you were gonna...

16:38.264 --> 16:40.365
I-I'm...

16:40.367 --> 16:43.267
I'm... I'm already...
I-i took care of myself.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.736
I already did it.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.939
What?

16:47.941 --> 16:50.942
When? Well, like, just now.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.678
I didn't hear anything.
How do you do that?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.847
I didn't even
feel the bed shake.

16:55.849 --> 17:00.218
When I do it myself, it's really...
Silent and efficient.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.788
Geez.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.223
Well, where's all the stuff?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.659
I-I don't know.
You don't know?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.462
I mean, it's on a shirt
or something down there.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.838
Hey, um, Fanny and Zander are in
for tomorrow night, by the way.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.840
Why bring up my sister when
we're talking about your penis?

17:23.843 --> 17:27.412
Well, you're the one who's
obsessed about Fanny, not me.

17:32.084 --> 17:35.753
What are you doing?
Watching GIF's on tumblr.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.589
Good night.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.052
Um, excuse me.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.555
Uh, hi. Sir? Yes?
How may I help you?

18:10.557 --> 18:13.624
Yes, I was just... I'm a really
big fan of Vivian prudeck's...

18:13.626 --> 18:15.560
Oh, excuse my bodyguard.
Hello.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.029
Hi. Hi. Wow.

18:18.031 --> 18:22.967
Sorry. I saw you speak, and I just was
really interested in your project.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.270
I see by your wedding band that
you're either married or separated.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.406
I am, yeah.
We are married.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.242
It's coming up seven years now.
Mel, get the release!

18:31.244 --> 18:34.378
Yeah, I just... and I don't
mean to be gauche, but, um,

18:34.380 --> 18:36.614
how much does this
sort of thing pay, or...

18:36.616 --> 18:38.449
What's your name, my darling?

18:38.451 --> 18:42.386
Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry, Vivian
Prudeck. I'm Alice. Alice brewing.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.923
If you'll allow me, Alice, I'd like
to ask you a personal question.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.626
Oh. Okay. Yeah.
Are you happy?

18:48.628 --> 18:52.230
Sorry. My profession sometimes
encourages me to overstep my mark.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.831
That's quite all right.
I understand.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.334
Happy? Yes.
We're very happy.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.903
We went to college together.
I was a freshman.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.771
And then took some time off.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.674
We had great faith in our love though,
so we did eventually get married.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.776
That's fantastic. Well, take care.
Well done, you.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.578
Oh, thank you.
Mel, let's jog on!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.614
There's a used Porsche
dealership up there.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.016
You could get some talent there.
Excuse me. I just really...

19:12.018 --> 19:14.285
I was excited to hear
about your project...

19:14.287 --> 19:16.787
Look, lady, I'm very
glad that you're happy.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.924
But my mission is to unveil the
archaic horseshit that is matrimony.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.826
Oh. Uh...

19:21.828 --> 19:24.862
The last thing I need is to waste
my budget on a couple of lovebirds.

19:24.864 --> 19:29.133
Hang on just a minute. Noah and I have all
kinds of problems. We're not perfect.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.036
We've been trying to have a baby
for the past four years.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.205
Our sex life
is purely result-based.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.607
And I can only orgasm
when I have to urinate.

19:36.609 --> 19:40.811
Sweetheart, these issues are amateur hour.
Okay? I've got a thesis to prove.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.981
Um... sometimes I think he wants
to have sex with my sister.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.683
Is she local?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.518
Yes. And she rarely
wears a bra.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.057
Okay, I'm gonna let you
do this on trial. Really?

19:53.059 --> 19:55.960
- But I'm not paying you.
- Well... oh.

19:55.962 --> 20:01.132
Um, look, I think to dedicate our time
we should be compensated monetarily.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.301
Uh, Mel, start the car.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.570
Okay, fine. Fine.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.505
I-it's okay.
Mel, the release form.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.007
Deal. Thank you so much,
Vivian Prudeck.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.143
Gosh! Vivian Prudeck!
This is amazing.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.579
Um... yes.
Okay, I'll sign here.

20:14.581 --> 20:18.649
Listen, I majored in art history at Tulane,
so I kinda know, you know, what you do.

20:18.651 --> 20:22.753
I'm actually part of the Vero
beach cultural association.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.224
I am <i> so</i> excited.
I put my number right there.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.660
Just so you can call us and tell us
when to start. Thank you. Great.

20:29.662 --> 20:34.065
A-any other questions too, just let
me know. I'm always here to help.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.434
Even if you want, you know,
just a little tour around Vero.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.837
Um, I've done
this sort of thing,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.406
but can you just explain
to Harvey?

20:42.408 --> 20:45.276
I don't think he knows
about the camera.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.212
Of course. You just have to look at me.
I got it.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.682
It's just an impromptu chat, so don't
look in the camera. I understand.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.552
At all. Just ignore the camera.
I understand.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.555
- All right.
- Fantastic.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.790
What was the question?
I'll ask you that again.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.260
Um, how did it all start?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.428
Uh...
Well...

21:04.430 --> 21:07.732
We met...
It was 1985, in Manhattan.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.067
And, uh...

21:10.069 --> 21:12.270
We were both heart fans.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.938
Mmm.
That is true.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.275
<i>Dreamboat Annie.</i>
Flawless. Love that album.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.144
Sometimes I think that's the only
thing we have left in common.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.812
I don't know about that.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.316
When we met she was beautiful.
And she <i> is</i> beauti...

21:25.318 --> 21:27.551
But she used to
wear these shoes,

21:27.553 --> 21:29.820
they were, like, these
green, snakeskin-y pumps.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.990
Oh, god. You make me sound
like a hooker, Harvey.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.459
Well, I don't think
that's what I'm saying, but...

21:35.461 --> 21:38.296
Look, I had no time for any of that.
I was a single mom.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.298
I was hustling my ass off.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.402
Getting laid or anything like
that was just an afterthought.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.804
But he was very
sexually aggressive.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.106
I... well, she was hot.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.008
And we were...
It was mutual.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.011
We were hot for each other.
There was a lot of heat.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.981
That's how I got her
to marry me in the first place.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.482
I was a champ in the sack.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.118
Okay. Wow. So modest.
I'm...

22:01.120 --> 22:03.020
Let's see.
Then we got married.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.488
Then we got married.
Then we got married.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.291
Yes.
That changed a little.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.761
- The first 10 years, that was...
- They were hard.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.463
Just a lot of pressure.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.532
Well, there was
a lot of stuff going on.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.501
She was miserable at work.
She was dragging her feet.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.470
She was in
the financial world and...

22:19.472 --> 22:21.772
Wait! No.
I loved my job.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.474
I just...
I struggled...

22:23.476 --> 22:25.676
Balancing everything.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.445
So we decided to make a change

22:27.447 --> 22:30.181
and we moved down here
to be with all the other Jews.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.650
I'm not... Jewish. I'm not...

22:32.652 --> 22:34.852
I don't think
you have to underline that.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.654
But also...
Also...

22:36.656 --> 22:38.723
Because Cybil's daughter Milly
lives in Miami.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.158
- That was a big incentive to move.
- That's not the only reason.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.327
I didn't say
it was the only reason.

22:43.329 --> 22:47.131
I read that article in <i> Redbook</i> about
prince Charles playing Polo in Vero,

22:47.133 --> 22:49.400
so it always struck me as a
very nice place to live.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.136
So we moved to be near prince Charles.
That's why we're here.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.639
The point is, the man can go anywhere in
the world, and he chose to go to Vero.

22:55.641 --> 22:58.309
- He's here a lot.
- Wouldn't call him a neighbor.

22:58.311 --> 23:02.513
And what about the concept of
marriage as a seven-year contract,

23:02.515 --> 23:06.083
that after seven years you walk your own
separate way and that's the end of it?

23:06.085 --> 23:08.152
Yeah. Interesting.
Hmm.

23:08.154 --> 23:11.489
Don't think it's a bad idea,
to be honest. I mean, uh...

23:11.491 --> 23:13.324
Cyb... I don't...
Truly?

23:13.326 --> 23:17.595
Sometimes I'm amazed that
Cybil and I made it this far.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.463
I think it's valid.
I really do.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.833
Is that too harsh?

23:22.835 --> 23:26.437
No. We're just here
to tell the truth, Harvey, so...

23:32.744 --> 23:34.311
Okay.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.749
Wait. I'll just get
the salad dressing.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.950
Okay.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.586
You okay?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.689
Mmm! Yes. Ah.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.425
So stupid.
You sure?

23:47.427 --> 23:48.626
Yeah.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.197
I can't tell what
makes you testier,

23:53.199 --> 23:55.099
entertaining or the pending
arrival of your sister.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.535
Well, the combination
isn't great.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.470
- Hello!
- Hey!

23:59.472 --> 24:01.705
How are you?
Good to see you, zenith.

24:01.707 --> 24:04.141
Fanny. You look...

24:04.143 --> 24:06.811
No. I love you.
I've been fasting.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.447
Hi. Peace and blessings.
Peace and blessings.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.415
You've been fasting?
Really?

24:11.417 --> 24:12.716
Yeah.
Oh, okay.

24:12.718 --> 24:15.052
Well, can you eat then, or...

24:15.054 --> 24:17.655
'Cause I have made a
casserole for everyone. Hi!

24:17.657 --> 24:20.391
Good to see ya. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

24:20.393 --> 24:21.073
Welcome.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.160
You wanna watch the TV? We
just got some new channels.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.496
Oh, no, no. Shh. He
doesn't know it exists.

24:25.498 --> 24:29.667
Still he doesn't know? He's gonna
find out eventually, don't you think?

24:29.669 --> 24:33.070
- Because he's older now, he could maybe...
- you'll see when you have kids.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.573
- It just seems sorta crazy.
- We just don't honor it as a concept.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.008
No, he doesn't know what TV is.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.610
Well...

24:39.612 --> 24:42.446
Oh! Gifts! We come
bearing gifts yes!

24:42.448 --> 24:44.582
Our gifts. Oh, boy! Gifts!

24:44.584 --> 24:46.792
Is this straight from the
free thinkers workshop?

24:46.817 --> 24:47.985
-Yes, it's incredible!

24:47.987 --> 24:50.788
Creative comrades using their
wares, making their inventions.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.090
It's so cool.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.646
Best thing we ever did was
moving here to be close to you.

24:55.658 --> 24:56.794
We could not agree more.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.429
Can we use your shower?

24:58.431 --> 25:01.031
What? Why? We had to turn
our water supply off.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.834
- The welding machine spazzed out on...
- while we were making the gift.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.603
Which you are gonna love.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.785
With the electrical
stuff, it went all cuckoo.

25:07.810 --> 25:08.806
Sounds dangerous.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.988
Yeah, but it's making
this mineral formation

25:11.000 --> 25:13.143
on the cement that's
just really beautiful.

25:13.145 --> 25:17.214
It's like this amazing, poetic,
wet bruise on our floor.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.283
A happy accident.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.651
You got it. Who's
ready for a shower?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.620
I'm gonna!
Shower!

25:22.622 --> 25:24.688
Shower!
Thank you!

25:24.690 --> 25:27.625
You guys freshen up.
We'll be chillin'.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.531
How great are they?
They're great.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.066
So funny.
They're so fun.

25:40.572 --> 25:42.673
- Yes, present time.
- The presents!

25:42.675 --> 25:44.909
What have you brought us?

25:44.911 --> 25:47.912
Open it!

25:47.914 --> 25:50.881
Is it these things
that are the presents?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.017
- No, we need those back.
- Oh. Okay.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.653
Okay, that's the first part.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.255
- Keep going. Keep going.
- -What is that?

25:58.257 --> 26:00.691
There you go.
I'm still confused.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.126
You made this?
Yes.

26:03.328 --> 26:04.728
Well...
Whoa.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.764
Ah.
Whoa!

26:06.766 --> 26:09.867
It's an at-home
agave spirit-maker.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.069
A...
Get outta town!

26:12.071 --> 26:13.737
You're welcome.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.773
Get outta here!
I love it!

26:15.775 --> 26:18.375
Wh... how does it...
What do you do?

26:18.377 --> 26:20.878
H-how does it, um...
oh, it's easy.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.248
All you do is, you get the
blue agave cactus from Mexico.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.517
Once you get the plant,
you take the heart out of it.

26:26.519 --> 26:29.687
You want to heat it up
to about 116 degrees.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.722
Mm-hmm. And make
sure... don't go over.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.258
I'm sorry. You said
there's a blue agave plant?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.626
Blue agave <i> cactus.</i>

26:35.628 --> 26:39.029
C-cactus? From Mexic...
Where do you get that in mex...

26:39.031 --> 26:40.931
It's illegal to import 'em.
Illegal?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.533
But we have a guy.
Yeah.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.401
You guys are the coolest!

26:44.403 --> 26:46.236
Are you kidding me?

26:46.238 --> 26:49.640
You make this thing
out of, like, copper...

26:49.642 --> 26:53.277
So glad you like it.
Where do you meet these people?

26:53.279 --> 26:56.580
He's from a moon-chanting
circle that we're a part of.

26:56.582 --> 26:59.617
You know, Noah and I have been
approached to participate

26:59.619 --> 27:02.786
in this sort of avant-garde
documentary study on marriage.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.221
Does anybody want a refill?

27:04.223 --> 27:06.223
We have?
Yes.

27:06.225 --> 27:10.094
It's this, um, award-winning, uh, British
filmmaker who's Helming the piece,

27:10.096 --> 27:14.231
and I just couldn't turn down the
opportunity to support her artistic vision.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.333
Oh, we're doing that too. Yeah.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.269
No, I-i don't think... it's probably
a different thing, 'cause...

27:19.271 --> 27:22.139
I don't know what you guys are talking
about. I haven't heard about this yet.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.241
The lady,
she came by the workshop

27:24.243 --> 27:27.845
and she <i> begged</i> us to do it because
of our open relationship.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.748
No. That's not possible. Yeah. What
was her name? Lillian or, uh...

27:30.750 --> 27:33.317
No, love, no.
It was, uh, Gideon.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.918
Gideon. Gideon. Vivian!

27:34.920 --> 27:37.821
Her name's Vivian. Prudeck.
Her name's Vivian Prudeck.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.289
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.425
- When, um... she's right.
- It was Vivian.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.327
When did sh... yeah, when
did this come about?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.362
Enough, Noah!
When did she...

27:45.364 --> 27:49.833
No, I think I deserve to know whatever
avant-garde sex games you signed us up for.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.535
It's not
avant-garde.

27:51.537 --> 27:54.672
I mean... but I can totally see
why you would think that.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.640
What's that supposed to mean?

27:56.642 --> 27:59.309
You know what's great?
That we're all gonna do it.

27:59.311 --> 28:02.212
Are we talking about sex? No!
No one's talking about sex.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.314
You brought sex into it.
It's not like that.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.949
At least we're all getting paid.

28:05.951 --> 28:09.153
No. Good. There's money involved.
That we can use. How much?

28:09.155 --> 28:11.388
It's actually quite a lot.
It started out as 5,000.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.358
But then we said we weren't gonna do
it, so she jacked it up to 10,000.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.493
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's so great.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.829
It's been such a lovely night.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.199
I'm feeling so tired. Ten grand?
Are you kidding me?

28:22.201 --> 28:25.636
When were you gonna
tell me about this?

28:25.638 --> 28:28.872
I... was gonna surprise you.
This is huge for us right now.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.075
I was gonna surprise you.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.143
I am gonna sleep well tonight.
Yes.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.213
Get a view of love! Yeah!
Are you kidding me?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.715
<i>Handcuffs.</i>

28:37.717 --> 28:40.851
After three years
of studying in Chile,

28:40.853 --> 28:44.822
the word that struck me most
was <i> esposa,</i> meaning "wife."

28:44.824 --> 28:48.425
But also, it aptly translates
to mean "handcuffs."

28:48.427 --> 28:51.328
An ancient language
has a message, perhaps.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.031
Marriage
is quite literally jail.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.367
Both parties
are stripped of their freedom.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.436
We are animals, after all.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.706
We are programmed
to maximize our options.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.342
Hot-blooded monkeys.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.877
Monkeys...

29:06.879 --> 29:08.212
In captivity.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.847
Cut.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.616
Okay, Mel, can you get me out
of these, please? Immediately.

29:13.785 --> 29:16.019
Turn your wrist.
Is it on this side?

29:16.021 --> 29:19.056
Just turn... stop saying
"turn." Take me out of them.

29:19.058 --> 29:20.624
I'm going to do it.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.027
Just wait there, please,
quietly.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.362
Thank you.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.297
Oh, my g... what...

29:27.299 --> 29:30.868
Can't... no, I can't...
Oh! Oww! Mel, do it!

29:30.870 --> 29:32.469
Okay.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.240
Oh, god, thank you.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.808
Sorry.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.611
Oh, I always get in a
panic in handcuffs.

29:40.613 --> 29:43.614
- How do you think it went?
- Good?

29:51.923 --> 29:53.457
Tsk-tsk.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.794
What?

29:58.930 --> 30:01.331
You know what that
place is, right?

30:01.333 --> 30:04.701
It's called
"your welcome spa."

30:05.603 --> 30:07.337
You get me?

30:07.339 --> 30:10.140
They give <i>handy</i> endings.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.143
I think you mean happy endings.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.480
Huh. Well, aren't
you the expert.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.467
Boats! Boats.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.204
Crash. Boats crash.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.973
Boats crashing.

30:42.975 --> 30:46.043
Psssh!
The big spoons!

30:46.045 --> 30:48.178
Life jackets in the garage!

30:52.884 --> 30:55.986
Oh. Sorry.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.663
Huh? What is this?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.899
Early anniversary.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.401
Is it Anthrax?

31:18.376 --> 31:20.878
I don't know what this is.
I don't...

31:20.880 --> 31:22.212
I don't get it.

31:24.215 --> 31:27.217
I-it's in town.
It's by the gas station.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.255
I'm not gonna sex you
for our anniversary,

31:31.257 --> 31:33.624
so you might as well get
a handy from a stranger.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.260
That's nice.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.631
You know what?
I could use a bookmark.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.334
We actually have these
in our house.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.570
And they're phenomenal.
They're like...

31:47.839 --> 31:48.939
Excuse me.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.442
Well, that's not
humiliating at all.

31:52.444 --> 31:56.680
Did we pay the electric? Yes, of course
we did. I think. I gotta call Lenny.

31:56.682 --> 32:01.118
We'll just come back! Yes! Of course.
Thank you, Ms. Michaelcheck.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.053
Shit.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.955
<i>This is Lenny.</i>

32:04.957 --> 32:07.257
Lenny. Hey, it's Noah. <i>Oh, hey.</i>

32:07.259 --> 32:11.428
Just wanted to triple-check that the
shop electric bill got paid in full?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.730
<i>Oh, god. Why?
Is there a problem?</i>

32:13.732 --> 32:16.700
That's why I'm calling.
We're sitting in the dark.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.769
<i>Ooh, yeah.
I'm looking at it now.</i>

32:18.771 --> 32:20.804
<i>Is there any other revenue coming in?</i>
I don't know.

32:20.806 --> 32:23.807
The 10 grand from this documentary
thing should be coming in soon.

32:23.809 --> 32:27.711
<i>That's great. When's that coming in?</i>
I'll ask my wife. Hold on.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.794
<i>- Lump sum or increments?</i>
- Is the documentary

32:29.819 --> 32:31.648
money gonna be a lump
sum or increments?

32:31.650 --> 32:34.751
Um, it's, uh... I think
it's increments. Yeah.

32:37.489 --> 32:40.724
You know what? I need
to go get a slushie.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.627
A slushie? Yeah! I saw
an ad for one earlier.

32:43.629 --> 32:47.597
It was like, oh, god, the '90s called
and it wants you to quench your thirst.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.766
Marketing, right?
Yeah.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.668
Get me one!
Yeah.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.172
Hold on. Here we go.

32:55.174 --> 32:57.975
Oh, god.
Okay, Alice.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.609
Just...

32:59.611 --> 33:01.178
Bring it back in.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.813
Just bring it back.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.781
<i>Rightnowblinds.Com.</i>

33:04.783 --> 33:07.017
Oh, god.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.152
Okay.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.755
Hacky sack club
co-founder.

33:11.757 --> 33:15.492
Field hockey, junior
varsity, two years in a row.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.128
Defense.
Defense, Alice.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.197
Defense leads to offense, Alice.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.166
<i>Lucky listener number seven could
win a dinner for two at Bonnie's.</i>

33:26.705 --> 33:28.338
Oh, thank you.

33:33.145 --> 33:36.480
All I'm sayin' is, don't let
nobody treat you like you basic.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.616
You have to embody your queendom.
All right, Lyn.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.618
Hi. Sorry.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.822
Um, I was wondering if... If I
could have a cigarette, please?

33:45.824 --> 33:48.892
Oh, my god, are you okay?
Lyn, give her a cigarette.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.534
They camels though. She doesn't
care, idiot. What's wrong with you?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.730
Thank you.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.767
Come here. It's all good.
We got you, boo.

33:58.069 --> 33:59.703
Ooh, uh...

33:59.705 --> 34:01.238
You okay?
You okay?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.508
Why you cryin'? Don't be rude, woman.
Jesus!

34:04.510 --> 34:07.878
But you can tell us if you want to.
Oh, it's, uh...

34:07.880 --> 34:10.647
Ugh. It's...
M-money stuff, basically.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.748
Yeah. I feel you.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.085
It's hard out here.
Life is tough as shit.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.320
That's why we doin'
what we doin'. Right?

34:17.322 --> 34:19.656
If you strapped,
then we could hook it up.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.192
You look good.
Know what I mean?

34:22.194 --> 34:24.094
We only roll up pretty bitches.

34:24.096 --> 34:27.397
You pretty, we pretty. Like, we could
get this paper together. Right?

34:27.399 --> 34:29.065
Um...
Do you get it?

34:29.068 --> 34:30.867
- I'm sorry. I'm not...
- Don't be sorry.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.869
That's right.
Never apologize.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.172
Never apologize.
Never apologize.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.373
What's your name?

34:36.375 --> 34:38.675
Um, I'm Alice.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.777
Alice.
I'm Bonnie.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.847
Tell her your name. I'm Lyn.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.782
She makin' like
she can't talk to nobody.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.451
Hi. You can call me bonbon.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.853
We gotta come up with
somethin' cute for you.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.688
Oh, I don't know. Like alley
cat or some shit, right?

34:52.690 --> 34:54.591
You seem like an alley cat.
That's cute, huh?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.860
Why don't we go inside.
Go inside?

34:56.862 --> 34:58.962
What's my nickname?
Lyn. You're Lyn.

35:03.801 --> 35:05.569
Is that legal?

35:05.571 --> 35:09.806
I-it's 'cause I like you and I
wanna help girls out when I can.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.908
I don't like
that boys club shit.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.077
No, you gotta jerk the
flank to make that bank.

35:14.079 --> 35:16.079
Gonna get mines, for word.

35:16.081 --> 35:19.382
I... I'm flattered.

35:19.384 --> 35:22.085
But I can't, um,
uh, jerk anything

35:22.087 --> 35:24.121
because I'm married.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.490
Oh, you married? I didn't know!
Whoa!

35:26.492 --> 35:30.494
Yeah, so I can't. And that's
actually how I got into this mess.

35:30.496 --> 35:34.231
I told my husband that we're making
a bunch of money doing this movie,

35:34.233 --> 35:37.667
and, uh, we're <i> not</i> making a bunch
of money, but he's counting on it.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.604
So I've lied to him
and I can't tell him because...

35:40.606 --> 35:43.607
Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's
why we're gonna hook you up.

35:43.609 --> 35:47.010
- I never thought you'd do porn.
- You got a couple choices. Okay?

35:47.012 --> 35:50.180
We get big money up in here 'cause
clients know our gorgeous girls

35:50.182 --> 35:52.782
are between
the ages of 18 and 21.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.585
Oh, well, I'm actually
34, so... you 21 now.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.288
You can either do a massage and
ball-cupping for 142 bucks,

35:58.290 --> 36:00.257
a topless massage,
no balls, for 175,

36:00.259 --> 36:02.425
a massage and a handy for 375,

36:02.427 --> 36:05.529
<i>or</i> topless massage with a
ball-cupping and handy for 499.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.765
I only take 23% commission 'cause
Lebron is my man. Hey, hey, 23!

36:08.767 --> 36:11.801
- Yeah. Free throws.
- Thank you, but...

36:11.803 --> 36:15.438
I commute from port St. Lucie
'cause Vero dick pays sick.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.841
This bitch
is from port St. Lucie.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.443
I made almost 2 G's
in tips yesterday

36:20.445 --> 36:23.146
'cause dudes
was feelin' guilty as shit.

36:23.148 --> 36:27.150
- Yeah, 'cause it was Thursday.
- Thursday be some crazy shit.

36:27.152 --> 36:29.386
Is everybody horny on Thursday?
I guess so.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.855
Hump day?

36:36.327 --> 36:39.329
Sweetie, come here. You wanna
see how smart your husband is?

36:39.331 --> 36:42.666
Can you please not park that damn
thing in the middle of the driveway?

36:42.668 --> 36:45.702
My stomach is not well.
I had burrata for lunch.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.205
Turn the...
Turn the television on.

36:48.207 --> 36:51.241
Gonna have to
strip down for this.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.944
Why do I eat cheese?

37:03.754 --> 37:07.824
I remember her eyes, you know.
Her eyes, they tore me apart.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.993
And then they drew me back
for more.

37:09.995 --> 37:13.563
She was glistening, and I
knew I was in trouble,

37:13.565 --> 37:17.200
because I never wanted
to look away from her again.

37:17.202 --> 37:19.703
And that was the first time
we'd ever been to a sex club.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.204
That's right.
Nine years ago.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.707
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. Yeah.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.843
I mean, I didn't even know
that normal people went to them.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.746
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
it's about activism. You know?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.414
It's about <i> actions.</i>

37:31.416 --> 37:34.217
We have a child together.
Actions.

37:34.219 --> 37:37.587
We don't need to be married
just because we exist together.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.122
We <i> are</i> together.

37:39.124 --> 37:42.192
Therefore socially
recognized as together.

37:42.194 --> 37:44.628
And it's about communication.
Yeah.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.197
That's the key to any
good relationship, I think.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.866
It's not just
an open relationship.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.102
Yes.
It's how you communicate.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.804
Yeah. If it's not open,
then it's closed.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.873
Yeah. And you don't
wanna be closed.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.075
When you talk about
an "open" relationship,

37:59.077 --> 38:01.811
how often do you sleep
with other people?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.880
All the time.
It's a constant.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.116
Never stops. It's a
part of our life.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.700
Take me through a
"constant" day of sleeping

38:08.712 --> 38:10.787
with other people.
How does that...

38:10.789 --> 38:15.058
Why don't we take a tour of the shop?
You still haven't seen what we do here.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.159
Shall we talk about this.

38:16.184 --> 38:19.062
Just quickly do this bit first?
And then I'd love to see the...

38:19.064 --> 38:21.164
And this is our baby. Yes!

38:21.166 --> 38:23.733
Free thinkers workshop.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.802
This is how we pay the rent.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.271
And through Zander's
illustrations, of course.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.806
He does this bunny...

38:29.808 --> 38:32.275
Wiesman,
the Jewish bunny rabbit.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.244
I'm working on a children's book

38:34.246 --> 38:37.514
about how Wiesman
struggles on Easter.

38:37.516 --> 38:40.157
It's about tolerance and
acceptance, communication.

38:40.169 --> 38:41.151
That's true. Yes.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.320
Just stop recording. It's a total
waste of time. Come see this!

38:43.322 --> 38:46.489
- Gideon, follow us. Come on.
- It's Vivian.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.926
This is our collection
of vintage sidecars.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.862
We're refurbishing them, remodeling
them, giving them new life.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.432
It's great, right?
It's a philosophical choice.

38:55.434 --> 38:58.968
Wow. So, is this how you
pay rent on this place?

38:58.970 --> 39:02.505
Yeah, and... and my... my
father runs a hedge fund.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.808
Ow!

39:04.810 --> 39:06.376
Come look at this!

39:22.059 --> 39:23.626
Hello.
Hi.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.128
And your welcome.

39:26.330 --> 39:28.732
All right. Uh...

39:30.534 --> 39:33.002
Is it your first time here, sir?

39:33.004 --> 39:34.471
It is, yes.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.506
I got, um...

39:36.508 --> 39:38.475
I-I...

39:38.477 --> 39:40.009
I have this.
Okay.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.444
It was a gift.
Mm-hmm.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.282
But, uh... would you
like a massage?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.052
Yeah. Okay.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.687
I'd like a massage.
I would.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.523
'Cause my neck... I have...
I have this stiffness.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.692
Stiffness.
No, no.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.260
Pain. Pain.
I have neck pain.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.996
I would love to massage...
To massage that.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.999
Because we also have
special massage...

40:03.001 --> 40:06.236
The massage plus,
the massage total,

40:06.238 --> 40:09.239
and, of course,
the massage total plus.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.876
Sounds all kinda the
same, uh, to me.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.412
I-I-i, uh...
About the massage plus...

40:15.414 --> 40:18.548
It's 142. It's the one
with the ball-cupping only.

40:18.550 --> 40:22.018
But I can explain each one. No, no need.
Why don't we just do what we talked about.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.154
The massage plus?
Right this way.

41:57.615 --> 42:00.450
- Ow! Ow!
- Ohh! Sorry.

42:00.452 --> 42:03.186
Oh, um, your welcome. Your welcome.
What is that?

42:03.188 --> 42:04.888
- What is this?
- There's cupping service.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.956
- No, this is an actual cup.
- For cupping.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.791
- You don't cup with a cup.
- Cup. Cupping. Cups.

42:08.793 --> 42:11.060
Stop saying "cup."
I'd like to leave now.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.196
No, please don't go, sir.
This is not pleasurable.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.532
- I'm just not that athletic.
- What does that have to do with anything?

42:15.534 --> 42:17.798
My forearms are very weak.
It's hereditary.

42:17.810 --> 42:18.568
Wh-what?

42:18.570 --> 42:23.339
Lacrosse is more of a hand-job kind of
cupping sport. Stop talking. Take a breath.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.708
- And stop.
- Okay.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.244
- Good lord.
- I'm sorry.

42:29.647 --> 42:32.315
Could you... would you
hand me my shirt, please?

42:32.317 --> 42:33.983
Sure. Yes. Oh, yes.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.552
Here.

42:35.554 --> 42:37.520
Um, this one or...
Just...

42:37.522 --> 42:38.842
sorry. I think
I got oil on it.

42:38.854 --> 42:40.657
That is literally the
least of my problems.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.961
How old are you?

42:47.331 --> 42:49.499
Twenty-one.

42:49.501 --> 42:52.702
You're 21?
Really.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.370
Why? You think
I look old?

42:54.372 --> 42:56.673
No, you don't look old.

42:56.675 --> 42:59.075
But you don't look 21.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.610
Well, I'm 30.

43:00.612 --> 43:02.612
That I believe.

43:04.181 --> 43:05.582
I'm 34.

43:05.584 --> 43:07.283
I believe 34.

43:12.556 --> 43:14.457
Could I ask you a question?

43:15.593 --> 43:17.126
Why are you doing this?

43:27.071 --> 43:29.272
I lied to my husband
about money,

43:29.274 --> 43:31.207
and I'm just bailing myself out.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.976
So you're married?

43:33.978 --> 43:35.878
Yes, I'm... yeah.

43:39.650 --> 43:40.817
Are you?

43:41.485 --> 43:43.486
Mmm. Barely.

43:45.723 --> 43:48.224
<i>Marriage is the best thing
that ever happened to us.</i>

43:48.226 --> 43:51.995
When we first met at Tulane,
in the cafeteria,

43:51.997 --> 43:55.398
she was a freshman, I was a
senior, and I'll never forget it.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.801
She was going to town
on this bowl of olives,

43:58.803 --> 44:01.738
and I said...
I was trying to be flirty...

44:01.740 --> 44:05.008
"uh, olives is not lunch."

44:05.010 --> 44:07.510
And she said,
"they is to me."

44:07.512 --> 44:09.178
Well...

44:09.180 --> 44:12.649
And so I said, uh,
"I'm Noah."

44:12.651 --> 44:16.252
And she said,
"I know-uh."

44:16.254 --> 44:19.422
So we laughed and...

44:19.424 --> 44:21.290
The rest is history.

44:21.292 --> 44:24.427
It can be hard though, too,
you know, marriage.

44:24.429 --> 44:27.764
Just... we struggle a lot. We have
a lot of struggles. Interesting.

44:27.766 --> 44:30.166
- How do you struggle?
- We're trying to get pregnant.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.868
Yeah.
But we can't.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.936
- Well, that's not entirely true.
- Yes, it is.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.139
We don't know yet. We're
just... we're trying.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.141
- We have sex very rarely.

44:38.143 --> 44:41.277
And when we do,
we sort of fail at it.

44:41.279 --> 44:43.680
Y-you fail at...
At sex stuff.

44:43.682 --> 44:45.715
- What?
- All of it, really. Everything.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.316
No, we don't.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.318
At least I never thought we did.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.454
I always wanted to be an artist.

44:51.456 --> 44:54.390
You wanted to work in
advertising, so that's... it's...

44:54.392 --> 44:57.493
That's still... A very creative position.
Not exactly the same.

44:57.495 --> 45:00.196
You never said you wanted to be an artist.
Well, we had a deal.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.398
We had a break.
Remember, we had a break.

45:02.400 --> 45:06.469
Yeah, we took some time off. A long break
because he was waiting for me to graduate.

45:06.471 --> 45:10.673
And the deal was that
we were going to go to New York.

45:10.675 --> 45:12.734
I was gonna get a chance,
finally, to pursue my career.

45:12.759 --> 45:13.910
We were gonna start new there.

45:13.912 --> 45:16.212
You know,
it would've been great.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.381
Uh, but my father passed away.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.316
His father passed away.
And I had to take over, so...

45:20.318 --> 45:22.485
And then after,
I thought we could...

45:22.487 --> 45:24.187
So we came back.

45:24.189 --> 45:27.724
Now Alice runs all the ad sales,
marketing, and graphic design...

45:27.726 --> 45:30.660
- Don't get to do anything, but...
- For brewing blinds.

45:30.662 --> 45:32.829
I always wanted to have a Bob,
like Louise Brooks.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.597
A what?
A Bob.

45:34.599 --> 45:35.329
A haircut.

45:35.341 --> 45:37.567
Yeah. My sister had a
Mohawk in high school.

45:37.569 --> 45:39.001
Who cares?
You tell me.

45:39.003 --> 45:41.170
What?
What?

45:41.172 --> 45:42.939
Change battery.
Quickly.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.307
Sorry.

45:45.275 --> 45:48.177
Stay there.
Stay there.

45:48.179 --> 45:50.780
<i>We have great deals on blinds</i>

45:50.782 --> 45:53.082
<i>installed in your home
or office.</i>

45:55.520 --> 46:00.456
You're not still bummed about, uh...
not working in advertising, are you?

46:00.458 --> 46:03.092
What? Oh, um...

46:03.727 --> 46:05.561
No, it's not that.

46:05.563 --> 46:09.132
I think, um, I just get so
anxious in front of that camera.

46:09.134 --> 46:12.201
Alice.
Noah.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.636
Okay.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.777
I think I'm just tired.
You know? Totally.

46:28.820 --> 46:31.721
Hi. Welcome. Welcome to
the free thinkers bookshop.

46:31.723 --> 46:33.422
- Hello.
- Hello.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.925
That's the bunny rabbit
that missed out on Easter.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.960
- What is it?
- A Jewish bunny rabbit.

46:37.962 --> 46:39.328
- Jewish.
- Mm-hmm.

46:39.330 --> 46:41.197
I'm the artist.
Mmm.

46:42.332 --> 46:44.734
Please come back and see us.

46:44.736 --> 46:47.603
Perhaps of a different
belief system.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.438
Now,<i> you</i> have work to do.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.775
- Are you Fanny and Zander?
- Oh. Yeah. Hi.

46:52.777 --> 46:54.510
That's great.
I'm Egon.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.913
Hi. My friend Zorn
from occupy Orlando

46:56.915 --> 46:59.515
recommended I come see you
about work out here.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.751
Yeah. What kind of work
do you do, brother?

47:01.753 --> 47:05.188
Oh, I'm a sculptor-slash-
performance artist. Oh!

47:05.190 --> 47:09.358
I make life-sized copulating
nudes with reclaimed appliances.

47:09.360 --> 47:11.627
Oh, that's genius.
That sounds amazing.

47:11.629 --> 47:14.263
What's the performance component?
It's called gut extraction.

47:14.265 --> 47:15.698
Wow!
Wow!

47:15.700 --> 47:17.500
Through volunteer subjects,

47:17.502 --> 47:20.770
I pull the energy from their
insides using breath and proximity

47:20.772 --> 47:23.472
and I transfer the human spirit
into the metal structures.

47:23.474 --> 47:24.774
Wow!
Wow.

47:24.776 --> 47:27.343
I can show you, if you
want to volunteer maybe.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.645
Very cool. Yeah! Yeah!
Of course.

47:29.647 --> 47:33.115
Okay. That's awesome. Right on!
Absolutely.

47:33.117 --> 47:35.484
It's cool, right? There's a stool here.
It's all we need.

47:35.486 --> 47:38.387
Thank you so much for taking
this journey of life with me.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.623
You're welcome.

47:40.625 --> 47:44.060
Okay, just focus on my nostrils.
All right?

47:45.662 --> 47:47.230
That's very good.

48:08.685 --> 48:11.754
Now, if you could just spread your legs
a little bit for me, that'd be great.

48:11.756 --> 48:14.045
You know what? We're
good on the guts art, bro.

48:14.057 --> 48:14.824
Oh.

48:14.826 --> 48:17.526
Well, when you use it with the
metal and it goes in there...

48:17.528 --> 48:19.929
You should walk away now.

48:19.931 --> 48:22.732
Begone, Egon. Don't apologize.
Just walk.

48:22.734 --> 48:25.601
<i>Namaste.
Namaste.</i>

48:25.603 --> 48:27.203
Na-must-go.
You were really good.

48:27.205 --> 48:28.804
Hey.
Na-must-go.

48:31.108 --> 48:32.775
See ya. Bye.

48:35.679 --> 48:38.547
I've been, like...
I'm sorry...

48:38.549 --> 48:41.617
Christ on a stick, they're
square for hippies.

48:41.619 --> 48:44.620
They didn't buy it.
Where did you find this dolt?

48:44.622 --> 48:47.356
- Craigslist, Boca Raton.
- Should I go back in there?

48:52.863 --> 48:57.266
I have spent six years
of my life into research

48:57.268 --> 49:00.770
and endured a lacerating divorce
from a welsh industrialist

49:00.772 --> 49:03.039
to authenticate this project.

49:03.041 --> 49:06.542
And you use Craigslist Boca.

49:06.544 --> 49:09.679
I'm sorry, Viv. He's the best we
could get for the time and money.

49:18.790 --> 49:21.958
I need chaos.
It's too clean.

49:23.093 --> 49:24.894
Maybe we should've
gone to Shreveport.

49:24.896 --> 49:27.997
No, Mel! Florida's the
one with the statistics.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.732
Shreveport.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.233
Besides, my nan used to say,

49:31.235 --> 49:34.403
bacteria grows richer
in a pristine petri dish

49:34.405 --> 49:36.339
than in a sullied one.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.676
I miss my nan.

49:40.678 --> 49:42.945
Maybe just tell them
it'd be more compelling

49:42.947 --> 49:44.680
if their marriage falls apart.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.852
It's my responsibility
to paint a picture.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.889
Maybe I just need
a heavier hand.

50:00.464 --> 50:03.666
I notice you're holding a helmet.
Is that something you wear in the house?

50:03.668 --> 50:05.201
Or do you have a motorbike?

50:05.203 --> 50:08.604
Just, uh...
Just had a little ride.

50:08.606 --> 50:11.474
That's all right. I can take
it out, if that's a problem.

50:11.476 --> 50:13.442
It's embarrassing.
What?

50:13.444 --> 50:15.378
Mid-life crisis.
Embarrassing.

50:15.380 --> 50:19.548
At your age, it does
just read as bourgeois.

50:19.550 --> 50:21.384
And garden fountains
are not bourgeois

50:21.386 --> 50:23.953
Wong told us to get those
and you know that.

50:23.955 --> 50:25.454
Who is Wong?

50:25.456 --> 50:28.224
We went to a therapist,
Dr. Sandra Wong.

50:28.226 --> 50:30.359
This was years ago,
when we first got together.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.461
Because Cybil, uh, said

50:32.463 --> 50:36.465
that i... I made our bedroom
a hostile environment.

50:36.467 --> 50:38.067
He snores.
I snore.

50:38.069 --> 50:42.371
So I took to putting
a pillow over his face.

50:42.373 --> 50:45.241
She tried to kill me, basically.
That's what that is.

50:45.243 --> 50:46.864
I tried to silence you.
There is a difference.

50:46.876 --> 50:47.743
Explain that to a jury.

50:47.745 --> 50:49.845
That's how you would kill someone.
Right.

50:49.847 --> 50:52.481
- If you apply pressure, which I didn't.
- Yeah, well, you could die.

50:52.483 --> 50:56.318
Dr. Wong told me to write
in this journal thingie

50:56.320 --> 50:59.555
whenever I felt like
I might want to kill him.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.191
Which is a much better idea.

51:01.203 --> 51:03.726
Which was at night,
when he was powerless.

51:03.728 --> 51:06.328
And he's flagrantly loud.

51:06.330 --> 51:08.197
Okay.

51:08.199 --> 51:11.867
- Flagrantly... loud.
- Got it. Thank you.

51:11.869 --> 51:15.604
Um, let's talk about family.
You have a daughter. Right?

51:18.508 --> 51:20.376
Yes. Milly.

51:20.378 --> 51:22.945
She's, um...

51:22.947 --> 51:27.416
Well, she's from my previous,
very brief marriage

51:27.418 --> 51:29.752
to Max.

51:29.754 --> 51:33.355
Milly is very independent.

51:33.357 --> 51:34.523
A...

51:35.926 --> 51:37.827
And...
You know what?

51:40.030 --> 51:42.731
Let's just...
Let's just leave her...

51:42.733 --> 51:44.867
I-I can't hear you.

51:44.869 --> 51:47.937
Let's just not... let's just
leave her out of this, maybe.

51:47.939 --> 51:51.640
Do you have regrets
about your role as a mother?

51:51.642 --> 51:53.876
No. No.

51:53.878 --> 51:55.111
No.

51:55.979 --> 51:57.913
Well, I worked a lot.

51:57.915 --> 52:01.217
Uh, maybe Milly harbors some...

52:06.623 --> 52:09.225
Let's just...
Let's just do what we said,

52:09.227 --> 52:11.760
which is, stick to
the whole marriage thing.

52:11.762 --> 52:14.230
Does Milly see you as a failure?

52:14.232 --> 52:17.299
She just said she doesn't
want to talk about it.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.268
Of course.
So let's not talk about it.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.604
Okay. Yes. Go to
another question.

52:21.606 --> 52:25.174
Yeah. Um, so, that's all...
That's all brilliant.

52:25.176 --> 52:27.443
Um... mm-hmm.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.979
Oh, it's beautiful out here.

52:29.981 --> 52:32.248
Yeah. Live in art
to make art.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.517
Yes, I agree.

52:34.519 --> 52:37.153
We're both artists in that way.

52:37.155 --> 52:40.990
It's a... it's a sensual
existence, don't you think?

52:40.992 --> 52:44.193
I suppose so.
Mmm.

52:44.195 --> 52:47.530
Being open is... is Paramount
to the free life.

52:48.698 --> 52:50.332
That's why I'm so thankful

52:50.334 --> 52:52.868
that you and Fanny let me in.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.771
Yeah, I understand why
you never got married.

52:55.773 --> 52:58.174
It's an old-fashioned,
stodgy principle.

52:58.176 --> 52:59.642
Yeah.

52:59.644 --> 53:02.044
And you're both like cavemen,

53:02.046 --> 53:06.215
with whomever you feel
or smell at that time.

53:06.217 --> 53:08.717
Yeah, that's true.
Like beasts.

53:08.719 --> 53:10.052
Hmm? Yeah...

53:11.621 --> 53:13.789
Oh. Oh. Oh!

53:13.791 --> 53:16.892
Oh, you know, I should
probably feed the chickens.

53:19.163 --> 53:21.063
Yeah.
<i>Namaste.</i>

53:21.065 --> 53:22.898
<i>Namaste.</i>

53:22.900 --> 53:26.135
Blast.
These people are puritans.

53:29.907 --> 53:32.174
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

53:32.176 --> 53:33.876
All ri...
Okay. Okay.

53:33.878 --> 53:36.679
We're gonna get you in the chair.
Snackies? You want Snackies?

53:36.681 --> 53:39.481
- We have your little
snackie bag.

53:39.483 --> 53:41.417
Shit.

54:01.538 --> 54:03.806
Clear, Alice. Clear.

54:07.111 --> 54:09.078
It's difficult,
isn't it, darling?

54:09.080 --> 54:10.879
Vivian, I didn't see you there.

54:10.881 --> 54:13.515
Trying to move forward when your
partner's stuck in the tall grass.

54:13.517 --> 54:15.084
Oh, yes, yeah.
I've been there.

54:15.086 --> 54:17.019
You have?
I was married, you know.

54:17.021 --> 54:19.288
You were? We're more
alike than you realize.

54:19.290 --> 54:22.024
I'm okay. Mmm. Okay.
You're sharp, Alice.

54:22.026 --> 54:24.460
You were right about Noah.

54:24.462 --> 54:27.129
I was? About what?

54:27.131 --> 54:30.399
It's not his fault he has a wandering eye.
He is, after all, a baboon.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.234
He's a baboon?
As are you and I.

54:32.236 --> 54:34.270
Yes. I've observed
your sister Fanny.

54:34.272 --> 54:39.308
Her robust fertility
that's awarded her a son.

54:39.310 --> 54:43.779
She is but abounding sensuality,
so effortless and free.

54:43.781 --> 54:46.649
Yes, yes.
I mean, how could Noah,

54:46.651 --> 54:48.817
a man of ripe virility,
ignore such a scent?

54:48.819 --> 54:50.986
Do you... know something?

54:50.988 --> 54:53.122
Here's what I know.

54:53.124 --> 54:56.258
Are you both really doing all
that you can to get pregnant?

54:56.260 --> 54:58.994
I mean, I know that you
are, Alice, but is he?

54:58.996 --> 55:02.398
Well, if I'm really
honest with you,

55:02.400 --> 55:05.067
the subject is really complex
because I'm really not sure...

55:05.069 --> 55:07.436
Oh, damn right it's complex.

55:07.438 --> 55:10.606
I'm sure that he operates
with fine intentions,

55:10.608 --> 55:16.078
but... a wild animal
cannot help

55:16.080 --> 55:18.047
but bite.

55:39.769 --> 55:43.505
I think the price is actually very
reasonable. The seller's very motivated.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.341
It's really beautiful.

55:45.343 --> 55:48.510
Oh! This is the seller's agent.
Honey, what do you think?

55:48.512 --> 55:51.647
So just... why don't you
just take it all in?

55:51.649 --> 55:53.549
I won't be a sec.
Wanna look over there?

55:53.551 --> 55:55.818
Yeah.

55:55.820 --> 55:57.386
<i>Hello.</i>
Hello?

55:57.388 --> 55:59.455
<i>Mom?</i>
Milly? Oh.

55:59.457 --> 56:01.724
<i>Hello?</i> Oh, honey,
I can't hear you.

56:01.726 --> 56:03.759
I'm gonna call you back.
<i>What?</i>

56:07.497 --> 56:09.898
<i>Hey, it's Milly. Leave a message.</i>
Oh.

56:12.636 --> 56:16.472
Okay, I guess you're in a
bad area, or maybe it's me.

56:16.474 --> 56:20.242
I don't know.
I couldn't hear you, honey.

56:20.244 --> 56:22.878
We... we're so excited
that you're coming.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.481
Um, i...
It's been so long.

56:25.483 --> 56:27.549
I feel like I'll hardly
recognize you.

56:27.551 --> 56:31.553
But I will.
I mean, I will, of course.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.390
It's not even a nice thing
to say. I'm sorry.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.325
Um... okay.

56:36.327 --> 56:39.528
Well, call me when you can.
Okay? I love you so much.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.830
So... so what's the catch?
Call me.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.832
I mean, did someone die
in here or something?

56:43.834 --> 56:46.068
Uh, yes, but natural causes.

56:47.504 --> 56:48.871
Wait, what?

56:55.078 --> 56:57.246
<i>I've actually got one that
I think will work for you.</i>

56:57.248 --> 56:58.847
Yeah?
Yeah.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.917
It's an s1k that we picked up
from a yard in Rhode Island.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.019
Okay. It's a little rusted
out, but I can sand that out.

57:04.021 --> 57:06.622
It'll rig on there okay?
Oh, yeah.

57:06.624 --> 57:10.459
I can prep the mount today and then you
can take it on and off whenever you want.

57:10.461 --> 57:12.795
I've never ridden
with the extra weight.

57:12.797 --> 57:15.798
It's like training wheels. You just
gotta be careful around the turns.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.466
But it provides extra support.

57:17.468 --> 57:19.568
Sure, sure. You got
yourself a copilot?

57:19.570 --> 57:22.771
Uh... well, in theory.

57:22.773 --> 57:26.909
Oh. Is this
a special occasion?

57:26.911 --> 57:29.645
Hopefully. Yeah.
Yeah.

57:29.647 --> 57:32.781
Yeah. Okay.

57:35.151 --> 57:37.586
I am so thrilled
we can make it work.

57:37.588 --> 57:39.621
<i>Me too. Thanks so much.</i> All right.
You got it, Mike.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.723
You got it. Paperwork's
on its way to you.

57:41.725 --> 57:43.192
Uh-huh.

57:46.095 --> 57:47.796
Ha!
Okay.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.598
Here we go.

57:49.600 --> 57:52.568
What...
I just signed it.

57:52.570 --> 57:54.102
I don't know the password.

57:54.104 --> 57:55.537
Is this it...

57:59.509 --> 58:01.243
Milly's not coming.

58:01.245 --> 58:03.445
Hmm?
What'd you say?

58:03.447 --> 58:04.913
How's the sex?

58:04.915 --> 58:06.014
Horrible.
It's great.

58:06.016 --> 58:09.117
He wears his glasses
during cunnilingus.

58:09.119 --> 58:10.853
I did that once.
Well...

58:10.855 --> 58:12.988
I am never gonna live that down.

58:12.990 --> 58:16.458
My vagina felt inspected. I felt that
I was under scrutiny of some sort.

58:16.460 --> 58:18.861
Why do you think I can only
come when I have to pee?

58:18.863 --> 58:21.463
What does that have to do with anything?
Alice, what is going on?

58:21.465 --> 58:23.625
- Can we turn the camera off for a second?
- Of course.

58:24.801 --> 58:28.136
Noah.
What... what... this vibe.

58:28.138 --> 58:31.773
I was just being honest for the
sake of artistic integrity.

58:31.775 --> 58:33.709
A noble cause.

58:33.711 --> 58:36.278
Okay, excuse us.
I just was trying...

58:36.280 --> 58:38.180
Sorry. Come here.
Noah.

58:39.315 --> 58:40.516
Pan out, pan out.

58:40.518 --> 58:42.317
What?

58:42.319 --> 58:44.286
Listen.
What's wrong?

58:44.288 --> 58:48.056
Every time we come in here, you
make it seem like we're miserable.

58:48.058 --> 58:51.727
I think we have a pretty great life.
Don't you?

58:51.729 --> 58:54.997
- Yes, sometimes, yes.
- Get in there.

58:54.999 --> 58:57.399
I don't think this is good for us.
I think we should bail.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.234
We need the money.
Fuck the cash.

58:59.236 --> 59:01.703
Fanny's doing it.
Besides, we can't bail.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.406
Is that what this is about? Your
maniac sister is doing this.

59:04.408 --> 59:07.676
You said we need the cash.
My maniac sister? Jesus.

59:07.678 --> 59:11.179
You said she's the most
athletic person you know, so...

59:11.181 --> 59:13.315
Okay. Who cares?

59:14.584 --> 59:17.052
Do you think about
sleeping with her?

59:17.054 --> 59:19.488
What? Oh, my god.
Do you?

59:19.490 --> 59:21.757
Why would you accuse me of that?

59:21.759 --> 59:27.029
I think I've been more than patient and
reasonable with your moody outbursts.

59:27.031 --> 59:29.064
For someone
who wants a baby so badly,

59:29.066 --> 59:31.500
you're making it pretty difficult
to want to have sex with you.

59:31.502 --> 59:34.002
You're being irrational
and mean.

59:34.004 --> 59:35.604
I'm being mean?
Yeah.

59:35.606 --> 59:38.607
You're being mean.
I am so nice to you, Noah.

59:38.609 --> 59:40.842
I play tennis for you.

59:40.844 --> 59:43.111
I let you smell my mouth
before I brush.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.947
I listen to widespread panic
for you.

59:44.949 --> 59:47.115
What about me?
What about you?

59:47.117 --> 59:50.385
Well, okay, the most creative thing I
have done in the past three months

59:50.387 --> 59:52.754
is hem your fucking pants, Noah.

59:52.756 --> 59:55.290
Well, there's... don't
bring up brewing blinds.

59:55.292 --> 59:58.393
Brewing never needs any new
artwork, and that is the truth,

59:58.395 --> 01:00:02.197
because you insist that "we need a
visual that clients can trust."

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:04.199
Basic brand. I understand that.
But you know what, Noah?

01:00:04.201 --> 01:00:06.268
I could have moved
to New York without you,

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.637
because Terry Schultz
had that extra room,

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:10.237
and I could have dealt
with those cats

01:00:10.249 --> 01:00:12.107
easily if I just took
Claritin or something.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.911
Then I could be getting coffee on my
lunch breaks or buying gesso somewhere.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:18.981
I could have a Mohawk right
now, but I don't, for you.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:21.316
So don't tell me
that I'm being mean.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.153
Alice. No. I will not have that!

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:29.992
<i>Namaste.
Namaste.</i>

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.195
Oh, god.

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:43.038
Fermented burdock? No,
thank you, my love.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.114
Fanny.
Yes?

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:55.817
No matter what roof
we've lived under,

01:00:55.819 --> 01:01:01.256
whether it's tin
or hay or stars,

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.826
I feel like we've always been
transparent with each other.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:08.196
The hearth of truth.
Yes. The hearth of truth.

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.370
It's... it's just...

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.440
This is...

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.876
Is there someone you're
wanting to connect with?

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.812
Someone you're wanting
to bring into our bed?

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:26.448
No, it's not that.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:30.152
I don't know if it's
because I'm getting older

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.721
or maybe I'm losing my edge.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:38.827
We haven't talked about the
fact that neither you or I

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:43.031
have brought anyone into our
bed in nearly six years.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.468
Fanny,

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.505
you are so much more than I
could have ever dreamed of.

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:54.910
And this hearth of truth...
Our hearth of truth...

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:56.912
Our fire...

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:01.183
I don't know if I want
to share that warmth

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:04.052
with anyone anymore.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:35.717
Jesus, Al.
Knock sometimes.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:38.220
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here.
I really didn't.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.956
That's why you knock. Okay.
Well, can I just go pee?

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:43.692
Yeah. Of course. No, alone?
Can I go alone?

01:02:43.694 --> 01:02:47.863
'Cause i... yeah, that kind of pee.
I got it. Yeah.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:49.931
Thank you.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.100
I'd like some privacy.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:43.652
Yeah, I'm not really sure
if that's what I imagined.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:46.621
Man, I get it. It's hard to stick
to the one you're married to

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:50.525
when you could always have the
newer, sexier model, right.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:53.161
So, why don't you live with it.
Yeah?

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.797
Right? And if it
doesn't turn you on,

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:57.165
you can always replace it.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.633
Good point.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.268
Hey, Noah?
Mm-hmm?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.637
Could I just talk to you for a
second, please? Yeah. Sure.

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:04.639
Excuse me.
Okay. All right.

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:08.510
Sorry. Hey, I just want
to talk to you. Okay.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.513
Are you taking hydrocodone because
you want to be with Fanny?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.648
What are you talking about?

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.384
I know you injured your elbow
three years ago mountain biking,

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.354
and you took hydrocodone, but there's no
reason you should be taking it anymore

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:22.123
unless you're deliberately trying to
sabotage our chances of having a child,

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.692
which was your idea
to begin with.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:26.795
Okay, where is this coming from?
I saw you take those pills.

01:04:26.797 --> 01:04:28.663
Those pills you take.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:31.199
Vivian said I should look out
for signs, and I saw signs.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.201
I saw you taking those pills.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:37.305
She said Fanny was "abounding" with all
kinds of stuff, and we're all baboons...

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:39.841
Stop!
Just stop, okay?

01:04:39.843 --> 01:04:41.476
Just tell me.
All right.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:43.478
I don't even know
where to start.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.381
I have to, like...

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.650
I... I'm not taking hydrocodone.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.418
I'm taking he shou Wu.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:55.056
It's for male pattern baldness.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.559
"Maherpatterbaldas"?
What's "maherpatter..."

01:04:57.561 --> 01:05:00.228
male pattern baldness.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.732
Oh.
Okay?

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:07.402
I got it from a Chinese doctor
that Fanny and Zander recommended.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.205
I didn't wanna tell you because
I want you to think of me

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:13.208
as this viral, hunky man,

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.011
and not some old dude
with his hair falling out.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:19.080
But why did you go to Fanny
to talk about that?

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.783
Why do you have this secret
meeting with Fanny? Fanny! Fanny!

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.719
Something you won't even talk to me about.
Let's clear up this Fanny thing.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:26.721
Okay. I would like
to do that.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:29.057
Let's just settle this, 'cause
there's something you need to know

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.859
about your sister Fanny.
What?

01:05:30.861 --> 01:05:32.794
She's great, but...

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:37.198
In the way
that llamas are great.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.870
They're cute in pictures
and maybe they're fun to feed,

01:05:41.872 --> 01:05:44.973
but I don't want one in my house
because they spit a lot.

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.910
I'm serious.

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:53.815
The best thing Fanny's got going
for her is Zander and zenith

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:56.651
and that she's got you
for her sister.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.790
Other than that,

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:05.527
she kind of smells like a
combination of ear wax and oregano.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.335
I love you, Noah.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.172
I love you too, Al.

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:21.209
Future mother of our children.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.018
Noah.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.890
I don't want to have a baby.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.527
What?

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:44.366
I... I just feel like

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:48.370
I'm putting
all this frantic energy

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.872
into trying to get pregnant,
and i...

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:55.410
The truth is it just really
makes my stomach hurt.

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:02.684
I only wanted to have a baby
because it's what you wanted

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:06.221
and because it's so obviously
what we're meant to do.

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:07.922
But i...

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.562
I'm sorry.

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.233
So sorry.

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:31.246
I mean, that's hard
for me to hear.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:32.747
I know.

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.384
Noah.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.087
Please don't divorce me.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:41.990
Please. Because then
Vivian wins, right?

01:07:41.992 --> 01:07:44.225
What?

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:48.630
Okay, wait. First of all, that British
jerk has nothing to do with us.

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.434
And second of all,

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:57.839
we're not getting a divorce.

01:07:57.841 --> 01:08:00.909
Okay?
Yeah. Okay.

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.112
Now, I admit,
I want to have kids,

01:08:04.114 --> 01:08:08.783
and i... I want
to have them with you.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:12.787
But when we got married,

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:17.024
we promised to walk through the
mud and the light together.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:19.461
And I meant it.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:25.433
So I gotta process this,

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:28.870
but I'm not going anywhere.

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:31.238
Okay. Nice to hear.

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:34.576
Now, I have to ask you
a very important question.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:36.611
Anything.
Okay.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:40.048
Do you, Alice brewing,

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.817
promise to extract us

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:47.755
from this toxic horror show
of a documentary,

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.991
for richer or for poorer?

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.627
I do.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.162
Okay.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.328
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.698
I'm gonna take a shower
before we get started.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.368
So I won't be a second.
All right, baby.

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.270
I have to finish this...
Welcome home.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:37.471
Hi. Hi, hi.
Guess who's here.

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:40.274
Hi, mom.
Milly?

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.678
- Holy shit!
- I'm pregnant.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.014
Well, I'm not an idiot, Milly!

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.948
This is precisely why
I didn't tell you.

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.618
I'm your mother, for Christ's sake.
Oh, my god.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.654
I knew you'd flip your lid,
mom, which clearly you are.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:56.491
- And how long? How far along are you?
- Nine months.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.726
- Nine months? -Nine months.
- Nine months.

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.129
Oh, my god, Milly.
You're so beautiful.

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.364
You better sit down. Harvey,
can you get her a chair?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.967
- She's got a couch. She's fine.
- Get her a chair.

01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:09.404
Mom, you have to calm down. Just
calm... no, stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:11.739
This is why I don't tell you anything!
What do you mean?

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:14.742
- Harvey can tell you. We talk about it.
- Did you know about this?

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:15.507
No.

01:10:15.519 --> 01:10:17.845
I've been working my ass off
preparing for this damn thing.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:19.647
- I'm broke.
- I'll help you.

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.584
I don't need your help. This crazy
lady is paying me $500 to be here.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:25.253
How dare you pay her only $500?

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:27.555
You're paying everybody else
way more than that!

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.657
No, 'cause I also
paid for her bus fare.

01:10:29.659 --> 01:10:31.759
That was nice.
They got the bus fare.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:34.028
- You made her take the bus?
- Oh, boy.

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.396
- A bus.
- Here we go.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.865
In her condition.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:40.535
You made her take a bus
in her condition?

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:43.404
Mom, it was fine. What
kind of barbarian are you?

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.415
It's fine. Stop it.

01:10:44.427 --> 01:10:46.908
I don't know what kind
of tricky piece of magic

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:50.044
you're trying to conjure up here
with your horseshit reality show.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:51.989
I don't know, but I'll
tell you something.

01:10:52.001 --> 01:10:52.914
It's kind of sexy.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:57.385
Pack up the cameras. Pack up your lesbian
and get the fuck out of my house!

01:10:57.387 --> 01:10:59.053
Can you just calm down, please?
No!

01:10:59.055 --> 01:11:01.022
Turn that off!
A bus!

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:11.099
- Hello?

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:12.600
Hello! Hello!

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:17.505
Oh. Oh, shoot! Coming!

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:20.174
Sorry.

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.544
Hi.
Hey.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.247
Sorry, sister. I didn't
hear you knocking.

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:28.149
Normally zenith hears it.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.486
Come on in.

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:32.987
Hi. Hello.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.923
Should I, uh...
Yeah.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.825
Do you want...
Yeah, sit down.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.586
I just can't breathe unless
there's incense, you know?

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:52.674
Um... so, I-i... I just want
to apologize to you, Fanny.

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:56.010
When I think of you...

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.413
When i... you know...

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.148
What?
I'm sorry.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:02.917
It's just so loud. Could we
tell them to just take five

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.485
or smoke something?

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.421
Of course. Yeah, sorry.

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.694
Thank you.

01:12:12.696 --> 01:12:14.595
From when you lived
in Lithuania?

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:16.364
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:18.533
So cool. Um...

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.735
I just want you to know that...

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.306
Even though you are
my younger sister,

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:27.141
I have always looked up to you.

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:31.012
I mean, you are so good
at making life

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.114
just exciting, you know?

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:38.553
And... strange
and wonderful.

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:41.456
You're like my life
spirit animal, you know?

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.691
I love that.
It's true.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.007
I love that.

01:12:45.019 --> 01:12:48.996
Noah and I will never
be as effortless as you.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.466
You know, probably 'cause
we could never handle

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:54.702
having multiple sexual
partners in our relationship.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:57.805
Um, can I just...
Yeah.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:00.007
If I wanted to do heroin,

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:03.144
I have the means and resources
to do heroin.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.615
Wait, what?
When did you do heroin?

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.652
Zander and I could do heroin,

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.755
but we choose not to do heroin.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.823
That's why we don't do heroin,

01:13:15.825 --> 01:13:18.226
is because we choose not to.

01:13:18.228 --> 01:13:20.261
Well, that's great.

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:24.198
I mean, 'cause it's
a really dangerous drug.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.267
Heroin being the metaphor
for cheating.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.270
Oh!
Yeah, we don't cheat.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:31.506
You don't cheat. What?
We don't cheat.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.708
See, that was such an
interesting way to say it.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.544
It would have been easier if you
just said it. It was quite a reach.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.679
Oh! Does Vivian know that?
I feel like...

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:41.449
Oh, screw that bloodsucker. Why?
You don't like her anymore?

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:43.384
She was trying to seduce Zander,
and he wouldn't let her.

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:44.685
She fired us.
What?

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:46.687
Yeah.
That's crazy.

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:48.790
She came over here and kissed him.
No. Stop.

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:50.091
She kissed him on the mouth.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.393
Oh, my god.
Fancy lady blouse.

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:55.596
I really thought that she was
one of the great people.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.533
She was picking up
on some dark energy.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.635
You're good at reading juju.
I know, right?

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:02.603
Oh, my gosh. She's terrible.
You need to get revenge.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.172
I know.
What are we gonna do?

01:14:08.244 --> 01:14:09.777
Hey.
Hey.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:16.984
So glad you got to have
a proper shower.

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:22.256
I just... I made you some sleepy time tea.
Thank you.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:24.492
And I, uh...

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:28.930
I put some Milanos there too.

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.566
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah.

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:33.935
And...

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:35.970
It's very good.
I know.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.272
Tomorrow night, if you like,

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:41.242
we can make some artichokes.

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:44.145
I'm probably gonna go back
to Miami first thing.

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.682
- Oh.
- So...

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.522
May I ask
who the lucky father is?

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.658
- Quilton.
- Is that a real name?

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.095
- Yeah.
- Well, he...

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:03.264
He sounds nice.
Yeah, he's super nice.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:05.600
He's in jail.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.101
For what?

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:09.437
For walking his dog
without a leash.

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:13.875
Oh, well, that seems
a little harsh.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:16.477
Yeah, well, he has a lot
of tattoos all over,

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:19.480
so he gets arrested for
stupid stuff all the time,

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:22.383
and then we don't have
enough money to bail him out.

01:15:22.385 --> 01:15:23.885
Well...

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:27.288
Nice to see he has a dog.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:28.890
Yeah.

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:35.530
Oh, Milly, why don't you just...

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:37.465
Stay here for a few weeks?

01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:39.200
Maybe until the baby comes even.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:41.669
See, I can help you
with everything.

01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:45.740
I'm sure Quilton would understand that
your mom wants to care for you right now.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:47.475
That's okay.
He'd get that.

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:51.379
No, no. We have a plan,
and it's your anniversary.

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:55.416
You don't want your pregnant daughter
running around, ruining the mood.

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:58.019
No, I do. I do.
The mood is fine.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:00.354
The mood is...

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:02.690
It's good.

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:05.560
Mom, he's stuck in jail, and he's
not gonna see the baby come.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.262
I can't just sit here in your guest
room, eating Milanos and drinking tea

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.830
and just waiting for him
to come out.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:11.933
We'll bail him out.

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.103
We will bail quilter out.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.040
Quilton.

01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.608
Quilton.

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:26.280
Mel, can you come
over here, please?

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.721
Do you want a shandy?

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.256
Spoon you?

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:52.640
It can't all fall apart.

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:54.742
I've come too far.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:56.644
They're all failing me.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:01.148
Where do I find new subjects?

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.320
There's a sex addicts anonymous
meeting in fort Pierce tomorrow.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:11.559
You're so clever, Mel.
You know that, don't you?

01:17:11.561 --> 01:17:13.027
Thank you.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.498
Could I call you Richard
from now on?

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.501
Maybe not.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.340
And I lifted my head
from her crotch

01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:29.276
and said,
"I don't want to be here."

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:32.680
This is not me anymore.

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:37.752
I choose to stop eating you out
because I do not know your name.

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.689
That's so great.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:47.628
- Hello?
- <i>Vivian. Yes, hi.</i>

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.264
Hello, Alice. Yeah. I can't talk at
the moment. It's not a good time.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:52.700
<i>Well, I understand,
but you were right.</i>

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:56.203
<i>Fanny and Noah, they're
cheating on me, and, um...</i>

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:59.707
They're doing it.

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:02.643
<i>Oh, my god.
I'm so sad.</i>

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:08.482
I found Fanny's panties
in Noah's briefcase.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:10.951
- What? I'm not a lawyer in an '80s movie.
- I don't wear panties.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:14.989
I mean, such is life. As I
always say, fate is inevitable.

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:17.391
<i>Yes, you are right.</i>

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:21.529
I just... I've been in
my car alone, crying.

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:23.330
And the shit just hit the fan.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:26.967
And the shit has hit the
fan in my relationship.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.537
We need to investigate
this arduous time.

01:18:29.539 --> 01:18:32.073
Yeah, we do need
to investigate it.

01:18:32.075 --> 01:18:34.041
And I want to do it...

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.343
<i>And I want to do it on camera,</i>

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:38.145
<i>for your documentary</i>

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:41.215
because I think I really
want to confront him.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:45.720
Wait. I've got an idea. What if we did
a public event on emancipation day?

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:48.489
It could be dramatic
and profound.

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:50.925
<i>Think about it.</i>

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:53.861
<i>Why be in front of one when you can be
in front of a crowd and really ruin him?</i>

01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:57.832
A crowd? She wants to do it publicly?
She's insane!

01:18:57.834 --> 01:19:01.936
You know, I think it's a fair idea.
I do.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:05.506
Because it's a perfect place
for me to free myself.

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:08.175
Why? What do you mean?
Free yourself from...

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.845
Uh... divorce.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:13.280
<i>That's right. Divorce.
I'll see you there.</i>

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:14.982
Di... bye.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.053
Mel!
We must organize.

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:20.521
Hey!
Sorry, guys.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:23.090
We're in a meeting.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.059
Come on quickly, Mel.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:27.061
I think I'm close to tears.

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:29.530
Mel. Mel, Mel. Come on. I'm in a pocket.
I'm in a pocket now.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:31.065
Okay, and...
Okay, good.

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:33.467
The jig is up, people.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.437
We perform these
lofty acts of love...

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:38.439
Sky-written proposals,

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:42.243
flash mobs of "I will love you
forever," blah, blah, blah.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:45.146
These are gestures
of disillusionment.

01:19:45.148 --> 01:19:48.649
<i>Modern society has the
privilege to evolve.</i>

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:51.252
<i>Seven years is more than enough
to ask of someone...</i>

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:52.953
<i>If any years at all.</i>

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:55.823
However, if you have taken
that futile path,

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:58.759
as I had done myself, in vain,

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:00.795
you needn't remain captive.

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:03.731
So often people
declare their love.

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:05.800
Why not declare your freedom?

01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:08.135
My subject, Alice brewing,

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:12.673
<i>after seven years of marriage and
servitude to her husband Noah,</i>

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:16.143
<i>will publicly exercise
her marital liberation</i>

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:19.613
<i>on none other
than emancipation day,</i>

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:24.251
the day that so many proud citizens
shed the shackles of bondage

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:26.487
in the name of human rights.

01:20:26.489 --> 01:20:28.622
A day that my subject, Alice,

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:31.158
will aptly demand hers.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.226
Cut.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:44.305
Well, shit.

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:46.307
<i>Well, this just in.</i>

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:49.109
<i>Critically acclaimed
documentarian Vivian prudeck...</i>

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:51.779
<i>You know, the one with
the wild ideas about marriage.</i>

01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:54.715
<i>She's hosting an emancipation
day event tomorrow.</i>

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:59.119
- Hey. Okay. The guys here say
it's not just the battery.

01:20:59.121 --> 01:21:00.888
It's the starter.

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:06.193
Or it's the... possibly
the sole... "solenord"?

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.229
I don't know.
I don't speak car.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:11.699
But anyway, whatever it is,
it's gonna be another day or so.

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:14.568
<i>I think we should just stay
in tonight, get take-out.</i>

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.670
Take-out,
for our anniversary?

01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:21.242
I know, but Milly's here, so we'll
just do a low-key thing, okay?

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:23.177
All right. Okay.

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:26.981
Okay. I'm waiting for my cab,
so it'll be another hour.

01:21:26.983 --> 01:21:29.016
Okay. See you in an hour.

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:32.253
Milly, you want anything while I'm out?
No, thanks. I'm good.

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:35.222
All righty. Actually, yeah, yeah.
Can I have some shrimp scampi?

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:35.887
You got it.

01:21:35.899 --> 01:21:37.925
But not from that Italian
place near the pizza place.

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:40.160
- I don't like that place.
- Okay. I got it.

01:21:40.162 --> 01:21:41.051
Anything else?

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:43.764
A bunch of chocolate stuff.
Just surprise me.

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:45.933
Perfect. Got it.
Thank you.

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.437
That'll do it.
Thank you, ma'am.

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:57.778
Yo! Zander?

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.284
Hello?

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:10.124
Anybody else notice
how filthy her aura was?

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:12.626
It was like...

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.762
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Harvey! Oh! Oh!

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:17.531
You're picking up today.
That's right. Come in.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:19.800
Hate to intrude. Sorry.
Meet my family.

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:23.103
- This is Fanny. Fanny, this is Harvey.
- Hello.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.105
That's Ophelia.
And that's Cyrus.

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.574
And that's Noah and Alice.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:30.277
- Wait. Where's Alice? Wait. Alice.
- Alice!

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.646
It took me forever to
figure out your eco-toilet.

01:22:32.648 --> 01:22:35.382
Alice, this is Harvey.
Harvey, meet Alice.

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:39.753
- We've met before, haven't we?
- No, no. I don't think...

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:40.432
I don't think so.

01:22:40.444 --> 01:22:42.256
There's something so
familiar about your face.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:44.959
- I think I just have one of those faces.
- You look so familiar.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.994
Well, look, Harvey.
You know what?

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:49.430
Why don't you sit down,
have a drink.

01:22:49.432 --> 01:22:51.572
I'm gonna mount that sidecar.
I worked really hard on it.

01:22:51.597 --> 01:22:52.900
Your special lady's
gonna love it.

01:22:52.902 --> 01:22:55.336
What's happening? You're
all stiff all of a sudden.

01:22:55.338 --> 01:22:56.937
- I didn't... no.
- Have more.

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:58.806
Oh, thank you.
Massage her, Noah.

01:22:58.808 --> 01:23:01.475
- No, no, no. No massaging. It's fine.
- How 'bout a massage?

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.311
- No!
- I'll wait outside.

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:07.014
- No, don't be silly.
- Relax, baby!

01:23:07.016 --> 01:23:09.249
- Uh, no, no...
- Please, I don't need...

01:23:09.251 --> 01:23:11.085
- Massaging you!
- Hey!

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:13.988
You guys hear about
that Vivian Prudeck thing?

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.325
Yeah. Yeah. We're going to that.
Are you?

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:23.998
You know, my wife and I, we're doing
this crazy documentary thing that...

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.834
- You're what?
- -Get out of here!

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:28.535
Oh, my god! You know
what I'm talking about?

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:30.604
We're doing that.
But we hate her.

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:31.094
No.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.606
She's doing that whole
thing because of us.

01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:34.641
That Vivian crazy lady?

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.677
- She's insane!
- No. No way.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.078
You gotta join us.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.348
It's here.
Hey.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.851
Smells so good.
I'm super hungry.

01:23:43.853 --> 01:23:46.787
Oh. Look at you,
with your candles.

01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:49.023
I just want it to be
nice ambience, okay?

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:54.294
So I'm gonna set it up and then you
can just have a good anniversary.

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:56.897
And I'll just go into my room.
What?

01:23:56.899 --> 01:24:02.269
Hey, what is more perfect
than... than this?

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.145
Okay.
Okay.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.871
Hi.
Hi.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.808
Uh, would you ask your mom to
come out for a minute, please?

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.747
Hey, mom, it's for you.

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.455
What?

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.497
Happy anniversary.

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:07.101
I know you may hate this gift,

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:09.470
or you may think
it's really selfish,

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:13.207
but, uh,

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:14.842
I realized...

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:19.480
I don't... I don't
want to ride alone.

01:25:19.482 --> 01:25:22.249
I really don't.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:25.252
I was gonna make it
"I don't want no Cybil war,"

01:25:25.254 --> 01:25:28.989
but I thought this was
a little more to the point.

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:47.574
What is this?

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.143
Happy anniversary to you.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:54.214
Is it a divorce in a box? No,
they don't make those. I checked.

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:08.862
I got this
so I could ride bitch.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:13.333
I...

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.068
I never knew
you wanted to join me.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.705
You never asked.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.055
Come on. Suit up.

01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:36.723
I'm taking you out.
Now?

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:38.892
- Yeah, right now.
- Oh, no, now? No.

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:41.795
We got a whole spread, like a table thing.
I don't care.

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:44.398
I'm taking you out for a steak dinner.
Come on. Suit up.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.001
Milly! Eat the food!
I'm taking your mom out.

01:26:48.003 --> 01:26:50.304
Okay, uh...
Just give me a second.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:52.339
Climb in. You're doing so well.
Exactly.

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:54.208
It's like a chair.
Wait, wait.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:56.977
But much harder. Thank god you thought
of this 'cause I'll be honest,

01:26:56.979 --> 01:26:59.313
with a head as hard as yours,
I forgot to get a helmet.

01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:01.148
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
didn't think about it.

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:04.384
Don't go... don't go till I'm
ready, till I know you're going.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.887
Okay. There you go.
Okay.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.555
Never seen anything cuter.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.691
You're like the cutest
cosmonaut there ever was.

01:27:10.693 --> 01:27:12.693
Okay, what do I hold on to?
Me!

01:27:12.695 --> 01:27:14.761
And your life.

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:27.407
Keep your hands...

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:40.087
Hey, Noah, do you think that...

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:44.258
Are you sure that there was no
alcoholic in the, um, sugar thing

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.393
that they had,
that they were serving?

01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:48.595
I don't know what the
hell was in that stuff.

01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:50.897
And that's why I didn't
drink any of it.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:53.233
No! You didn't?

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:56.937
No. I didn't. We were supposed
to be together in that.

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:59.706
I don't drink anything
from that house

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:01.708
'cause it could be
goat pee or who knows?

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:03.777
Who makes it at 165? That doesn't
even... what's happening?

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:07.714
What are you doing? I'm trying
to make these bagel bites.

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:09.383
You want some help with that?
So much to read.

01:28:09.385 --> 01:28:11.918
I just want to admit
something to you. Okay.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.222
Just... I want to be completely frank.
Lay it on me.

01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:17.424
I think I might be a little
bit buzzed because...

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:19.993
Not really drunk or anything,
but just a wee bit buzzed.

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:23.630
Because honestly, I, um... I
want you to be up here with me.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:25.565
It's so fun.
Come, come, come, come.

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:27.834
I am jealous of where
you are right now.

01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:30.237
I have some catching up to do.
I know!

01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:33.040
<i>I'm going to get some glasses.</i>

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:22.182
Let me guess. You must be Quilton.
Yeah.

01:30:22.184 --> 01:30:24.718
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet <i> you.</i>

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.621
Thank you so much for
bailing me out, Mr. burger.

01:30:27.623 --> 01:30:30.457
Please, call me Harvey.
All right, Harvey.

01:30:30.459 --> 01:30:34.094
Okay. I'm so embarrassed that
we had to meet like this.

01:30:34.096 --> 01:30:36.096
Ah, don't you even
worry about it.

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:37.798
Here we go.
Hop on in.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.733
How 'bout that?

01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:41.568
That's the... that's your ride?
That's it.

01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:44.371
Sweet, right?

01:30:44.373 --> 01:30:46.640
Yeah. I'm afraid of motorcycles.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:52.913
You actually...
Really?

01:30:52.915 --> 01:30:54.815
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.

01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.752
Okay. Tell you what.

01:30:58.754 --> 01:31:01.455
I promise I won't do
any wheelies today.

01:31:01.457 --> 01:31:03.390
Please don't. Yeah, don't...
please don't do that.

01:31:03.392 --> 01:31:05.125
No, I'm kidding. 'Cause you can't.
Okay.

01:31:05.127 --> 01:31:07.994
That was a joke.
You can't do... okay.

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:10.831
It's just like a car,
except there's no roof.

01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:12.499
And it's not a car.

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:16.303
My heart is on high.

01:31:16.305 --> 01:31:20.774
How can I be so blessed that my subjects
be so ripe for their noble demise?

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:25.846
- Mel?
- I'm right here.

01:31:25.848 --> 01:31:28.014
Is the boom operator here yet?

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:30.517
A professional person
should be tardy for no one.

01:31:30.519 --> 01:31:33.687
He's been here for 20 minutes.
Good.

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:38.158
Let him wait 10 more. Time
is dictated by its leader.

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.363
You look like the hippie
actor we hired who bombed.

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:45.198
Yeah, it's him.
Sorry.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.167
Why is he here for the
boom operator position?

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.169
I majored
in artistic psychology.

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:51.371
Mel, I'd like a sidebar.

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:56.510
This makes me very uncomfortable.
He's very intuitive.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.678
I don't work
with attractive people.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.214
I'm questioning his competence.

01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:05.385
He said he would do it for free if you
give him a signed copy of <i> tween jungle.</i>

01:32:05.387 --> 01:32:07.287
He saw <i> tween jungle?</i>

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:13.026
Welcome to the team.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:16.029
Right on. Wow. Thank you.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.965
Um, next time, more coverage
on the wardrobe selection.

01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:21.167
Oh, nipple. Sorry.

01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:24.237
Both sides. I didn't
mean to do that.

01:32:25.806 --> 01:32:27.240
Yeah.
Good.

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:39.920
Famed documentarian Vivian Prudeck
is here for an upcoming project

01:32:39.922 --> 01:32:42.255
concerning the surroundings
of her theories.

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:44.190
Look at this.
Hey.

01:32:44.192 --> 01:32:46.526
- Huh?
- Oh-ho!

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:49.195
- Nice, mom. Very impressive.
- She's a pro.

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:50.997
Just drive safe.

01:32:50.999 --> 01:32:52.632
Oh, yeah. Very good.
Have fun!

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.754
How are you?

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.356
Excellent.
Okay, good. Thank you.

01:33:16.358 --> 01:33:18.525
We have plenty.
So pass this...

01:33:18.527 --> 01:33:20.594
Do you know what you're doing?

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:22.195
No, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:24.297
Oh, okay. Crate of eggs.
Crate of eggs.

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:25.799
Baby!

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:29.569
Hey, dad!
Hi, mama!

01:33:29.571 --> 01:33:31.738
There's our little minnow.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:38.979
Oh.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.496
You all set?
Mm-hmm.

01:33:56.498 --> 01:34:00.400
Ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome Ms.
Vivian Prudeck.

01:34:00.402 --> 01:34:03.136
Hello. Hello. Hi.

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.138
Happy emancipation day.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.973
Thank you all so much.

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.075
As I think most of you know,

01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:12.145
my documentary project,
<i>I do until I don't,</i>

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.681
examines the idea that marriage
should be a seven-year contract

01:34:14.683 --> 01:34:16.449
with an option to renew.

01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:19.419
Today's presentation
is not so much a performance

01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:21.154
as it is a declaration.

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.423
In the words of Dr. Coontz,

01:34:23.425 --> 01:34:26.926
we should ban all performance
weddings to begin with.

01:34:26.928 --> 01:34:30.864
<i>I'm not insinuating that the idea...</i> mmm.
That's where they are?

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:33.266
<i>I'm saying if you build a union on
fantasy...</i> yeah, it's that lady.

01:34:33.268 --> 01:34:35.502
<i>Then it's impossible
to maintain.</i>

01:34:35.504 --> 01:34:38.338
I'm simply proposing
marital reform.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.940
Reform is
an evolutionary privilege.

01:34:40.942 --> 01:34:44.844
Uh, what's so bad
about marriage anyway?

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:49.315
Well, I think the convention has merited
a slightly more complex analysis

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:51.117
than just saying it's "bad."

01:34:51.119 --> 01:34:53.119
I have a question.
Yes?

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:57.323
Um, life is hard enough. Why not have a
human constant to go through it with?

01:34:57.325 --> 01:35:00.727
What kind of constant
are you referring to, sir?

01:35:00.729 --> 01:35:03.830
'Cause the only constant
that humans are capable of

01:35:03.832 --> 01:35:06.633
is that of a philandering nature, Mr.
Constant.

01:35:06.635 --> 01:35:09.736
- Care to comment?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:13.506
Oh, you don't know what you're talking
about? Wow. Guess what, Noah.

01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:16.509
I have something I really want
to talk to you about right now.

01:35:16.511 --> 01:35:18.545
Okay.

01:35:18.547 --> 01:35:22.482
After all of these years, and after
everything that we have been through,

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.184
how dare you?

01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:29.255
What part of you
could so flagrantly...

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:35.428
Continue to love me wholly
despite my flaws?

01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:37.564
Aw!

01:35:37.566 --> 01:35:39.165
<i>Because</i> of your flaws, Alice.

01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:41.067
I'm your constant.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.069
I am your constant.
No, no, no. Wait!

01:35:44.506 --> 01:35:47.006
I'll be your constant.
And I will be yours.

01:35:47.008 --> 01:35:49.409
- Yeah?
- Shh! Alice!

01:35:49.411 --> 01:35:52.879
- You promised. You said...
- Oh, come off it, Vivian.

01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:55.782
Look, no one's cheating
on anyone.

01:35:55.784 --> 01:35:58.051
And no one's getting a divorce.

01:35:58.053 --> 01:36:01.688
Vivian, if I may? And I think I
speak on behalf of everybody here.

01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.724
You don't have to get married,
but let others work it out.

01:36:04.726 --> 01:36:07.393
Don't make it worse.
We've got enough problems.

01:36:07.395 --> 01:36:10.263
Come on, people. You don't
all believe this, do you?

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:13.733
People only partake in open
relationships for the bragging rights.

01:36:13.735 --> 01:36:16.402
Yeah, but you're in
a bloody open relationship.

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:19.405
Yeah, but we've been monogamous
for, like, six years now.

01:36:19.407 --> 01:36:22.609
- You're a liar and a conformist.
- Hey, what about penguins?

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:25.278
- They're monogamous!
- -Yeah!

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.813
Really? Penguins?

01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:29.215
You have all been brainwashed!

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:33.419
It's a ruse! "Ew! Scary!"
No, it's not scary!

01:36:33.421 --> 01:36:36.589
Polyamory is our birthright.

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:39.159
- Hey, Fanny?
- Yes, Zander?

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:44.430
- Will you marry me?
- -What?

01:36:44.432 --> 01:36:45.899
Yes.

01:36:45.901 --> 01:36:48.635
No! No!

01:36:48.637 --> 01:36:52.939
You can't just... no, you can't! You
can't just ask her to marry you!

01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:55.175
Whoo!

01:37:10.592 --> 01:37:12.959
Brother-in-law!

01:37:12.961 --> 01:37:15.428
Milly! Oh, my god!
What?

01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:17.197
We gotta get out of here!
What? What?

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:19.632
Milly's going into labor. My
daughter's going to have a baby.

01:37:19.634 --> 01:37:21.167
Now?
Yeah, now. Now.

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:23.269
Why would she do that now?

01:37:23.271 --> 01:37:25.305
What?

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:29.442
It's on our way.
On your way? Really?

01:37:29.444 --> 01:37:30.877
We'll follow you.

01:37:44.226 --> 01:37:48.027
What are you doing, you animal?
Put me down! Put me down, please!

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:50.129
What are you doing,
kissing me like that?

01:37:52.133 --> 01:37:53.666
Stop talking.

01:37:53.668 --> 01:37:55.702
Egon!

01:37:55.704 --> 01:37:57.670
It's quite a nice name, Egon.

01:37:57.672 --> 01:38:00.206
You're gonna be fine.
This is really it.

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:02.075
So you step down. We're
just gonna get the keys.

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:03.877
- Whoa, whoa.

01:38:03.879 --> 01:38:06.479
- Go to it, babe.
- Wait a second. Where is the damn car?

01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:08.248
The car is in the shop.
You knew that.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:11.684
You're welcome certainly
to take our car.

01:38:11.686 --> 01:38:13.887
That's not a car even!

01:38:13.889 --> 01:38:15.855
Sidecar has room. I'll
get her there fast. No!

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:18.024
Oh, that is significant!

01:38:18.026 --> 01:38:21.160
You guys, I think we should just stay here.
Is that a possibility?

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:22.662
What's going on?
What?

01:38:22.664 --> 01:38:24.697
We'll do it in the house.
Have the baby in the house.

01:38:24.699 --> 01:38:27.600
Feels like an urgent situation.
We should just make a decision.

01:38:27.602 --> 01:38:30.503
The baby is coming, for crying out loud!
I'm a Doula. Don't worry.

01:38:30.505 --> 01:38:33.039
- What is a Doula?
- You know, the tractor's really safe.

01:38:33.041 --> 01:38:33.925
No!

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:36.576
I don't wanna go anywhere!
Let's just stay here.

01:38:36.578 --> 01:38:38.411
She wants to stay here.
Let's just stay here.

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:39.846
What?

01:38:39.848 --> 01:38:42.181
Boil some water.
What?

01:38:42.183 --> 01:38:45.184
- She knows what she's doing.
- She knows what she's doing?

01:38:45.186 --> 01:38:48.021
Wait, wait.
What...

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:53.359
Okay, sweetie. We're gonna do it
in the house. It's happening.

01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:56.696
It's happening in the house.
Chop, chop.

01:38:56.698 --> 01:38:58.898
It's not good. It's not good.
It's not good.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.035
What's not good, honey?
Ma, just... be cool.

01:39:02.037 --> 01:39:04.070
Try the banana?
You want this banana?

01:39:04.072 --> 01:39:06.205
No, I don't want the banana.

01:39:33.435 --> 01:39:35.501
Oh! Baby!

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:17.043
We are never selling this house.

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:39.132
Deal.

01:42:11.426 --> 01:42:13.793
<i>Hey, Vero beach.
You got blinds on the mind?</i>

01:42:13.795 --> 01:42:16.996
<i>Come down to brewing blinds to

01:42:16.998 --> 01:42:19.999
<i>Save on energy with beautiful

01:42:20.001 --> 01:42:23.169
<i>Let brewing blinds go ahead

<i>We can give you peace of blind by
making your home where the heart is,</i>

01:42:26.241 --> 01:42:27.940
<i>not where the heat is.</i>

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:30.243
<i>After all, love is blind.</i>

01:42:30.245 --> 01:42:33.779
<i>Didn't recognize us? You guessed it.
Brewing blinds has a new look.</i>

01:42:33.781 --> 01:42:36.916
<i>But not to fear. We've got the same
old attention to value and service.</i>

01:42:36.918 --> 01:42:40.686
<i>On a budget? Here's news
that will blow your blind.</i>

01:42:40.688 --> 01:42:42.955
<i>We're proud to announce
brewing basics.</i>

01:42:42.957 --> 01:42:46.092
<i>Our new standard line of blinds
offers the same brewing quality</i>

01:42:46.094 --> 01:42:49.195

<i>So come on, Vero beach.
Make a date.</i>

01:42:51.533 --> 01:42:54.267
<i>Make a blind date
with brewing blinds today.</i>

01:42:54.269 --> 01:42:56.469
<i>Blindful thinking since 1953.</i>

01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:57.870
<i>Go, gators!</i>
