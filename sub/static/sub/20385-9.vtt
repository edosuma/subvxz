02:38.526 --> 02:40.160
You want some pop?
Sprite or something?

No.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.403
[Gloria]
This is Deputy Gloria Burgle,

02:49.437 --> 02:50.671
Meeker County
Sheriff's office,

02:50.704 --> 02:51.972
with an interview
of Emmit Stussy,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.374
March 16, 2011.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.546
First up,
I'm curious about something.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.481
Your house is
an hour's drive from here.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.650
There's three St. Cloud metros
near your office.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.318
Why come all
the way down here?

03:04.352 --> 03:05.619
You gave me your card.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.222
Okay, then.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.159
Well,
I got a lot of questions,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.161
but I guess,
maybe, you should just start.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.330
I want to be
clear about something.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.766
If anybody comes here,
claiming to be my lawyer,

03:18.799 --> 03:19.800
don't let them in.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.236
-Like who?
-Anybody.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.340
I'm saying,
I'm here on my own proxy.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.208
Want no contact
with the outside world.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.177
Don't trust anyone who comes,

03:30.210 --> 03:31.245
if they do,
which they may not.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.718
He was right, you know?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.119
-Who?
-Ray.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.154
I tricked him.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.892
Or not tricked, but...

03:46.560 --> 03:48.629
A lie is not a lie
if you believe it's true,

03:48.662 --> 03:49.597
do you think that?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.333
It's not my story.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.235
I think that.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.138
Or I did, I guess.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.008
I don't know
what I believe now.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.581
He played tennis.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.250
Ray?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.721
Our dad.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.290
At his club, rain or shine,
every Saturday.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.591
He had that
thing all dads have

04:17.625 --> 04:19.226
after 30 years
of wearing socks,

04:19.259 --> 04:20.794
where the hair gets worn away,

04:20.828 --> 04:22.663
so he's basically bald
from the shins down.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.531
[chuckles]

04:26.266 --> 04:28.402
I was on the drive,
you know, throwing

04:28.436 --> 04:30.804
a ball against the house,
a tennis ball.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.442
Wasn't supposed to,
but he was gone, so...

04:34.475 --> 04:37.611
And Ray's someplace,
kitchen probably,

04:37.645 --> 04:39.313
he was always eating,
that kid.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.314
Real chubby.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.151
And then, Dad's home.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.756
He had this old
Mercedes diesel,

04:48.789 --> 04:49.890
you could hear it on the come.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.361
So I hide
the ball and he pulls in.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.267
Not out of
the car ten seconds,

05:00.300 --> 05:03.371
when down he goes,
flat on his face.

05:03.404 --> 05:07.775
One minute, he's waving hello,
the next, just drops like...

05:07.808 --> 05:09.410
Like the lights go out.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.047
[shudders]

05:21.154 --> 05:23.123
[breathes deeply]

05:23.156 --> 05:25.025
I killed him.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.259
-Your dad?
-Ray.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.262
First I tricked him,

05:30.698 --> 05:31.599
then I killed him.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.402
Like no days had passed.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.470
Like one thing
goes and then another.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.406
Like you whack a tennis ball
back and forth.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.675
Killed him where?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.744
In the den of
a shithole apartment.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.415
Framed
picture-puzzle in the wall,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.016
like some six-year-old,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.418
so proud,
he had to hang it up.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.087
Christmas Eve.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.591
You think there's
a special level of hell

05:57.625 --> 05:59.793
for people that killed their
loved ones on Christmas Eve?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.402
I wanted the stamps, see?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.906
My dad gave me a car,
but I wanted the stamps.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.742
What 17-year-old
boy wants stamps

06:14.775 --> 06:16.243
when he can have
a cherry-red Corvette?

06:16.276 --> 06:18.712
But I did.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.214
And Ray, like I said,
he was a chubby kid.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.216
15 years old,
never been laid,

06:23.250 --> 06:24.818
never even felt
up a girl, so...

06:28.489 --> 06:29.790
I let it slip.

06:31.659 --> 06:36.564
How this car, well...
It's like a magnet, isn't it?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.732
Like catnip for kitty cats,

06:38.766 --> 06:40.534
and if you turn up
to school Monday

06:40.568 --> 06:42.269
in this thing,
well, it's a done deal.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.740
And now, he's begging me.

06:46.774 --> 06:50.310
"Emmit, please, take the damn
stamps, give me the car."

06:50.343 --> 06:51.411
Like it's his idea.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.415
What's that old quote, that...

06:55.449 --> 06:57.050
"The greatest trick
the Devil ever pulled

06:57.084 --> 06:58.986
"was convincing
the world he didn't exist."

07:03.090 --> 07:04.492
How did you?

07:04.525 --> 07:05.626
I cut his throat.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.295
Blood everywhere.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.330
"Exsanguinate,"
that's the term,

07:10.363 --> 07:11.632
the cause of death.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.333
But how, exactly?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.572
One stamp left.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.240
I sold the rest
and used the capital

07:20.273 --> 07:21.509
to get things rolling,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.010
but I kept the two-cent,

07:23.043 --> 07:24.978
hung it on the wall
of my study.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.147
Like it was my first
dollar I ever made.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.851
But think of it
from his point of view,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.120
my brother.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.122
Like a stick in the eye,
every time he...

07:36.524 --> 07:38.992
'Cause I won, see?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.362
I won.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.699
And he spent his days watching
scumbags piss on his shoes.

07:50.037 --> 07:54.374
So, I go to him and,
"Enough's enough," I said.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.777
"This dumb feud,
let's put it in the past."

07:56.810 --> 07:59.980
And I give him the frame,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.315
but he's still mad
and he tries to give it back,

08:02.349 --> 08:04.985
so we start shoving
and the frame breaks.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.288
And a piece of glass,
stuck in his neck.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.189
You hit him with it?

08:09.222 --> 08:11.124
No, I didn't... I...

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
I didn't mean to...

08:13.193 --> 08:15.362
It was just one of those,
"What are the odds?" moments.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.032
Murder though,
I'm not saying it wasn't.

08:19.066 --> 08:19.900
Hmm.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.373
Thirty years I've
been killing him.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.010
That was just when he fell.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.257
[keyboard clacking]

08:48.796 --> 08:50.931
I'm not sure
one's gonna do it.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.200
I got another picked out,
closer to the precinct.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.403
What matters is
he signs those papers.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.438
And we get him
out of that precinct

08:58.471 --> 08:59.740
before he gets too chatty.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.074
I can monitor the radios,

09:01.108 --> 09:02.542
see if there's a workaround
to the new security.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.613
No, let's move shop,
go to stage four. No mistakes.

Who's this?

13:59.272 --> 14:00.173
[Nikki] You first .

14:02.042 --> 14:05.345
Madam, it's just lazy
to steal from someone

14:05.378 --> 14:07.680
without knowing their name.

14:07.714 --> 14:11.584
Yeah. That's what I am. Lazy.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.585
[Varga] Oh.. .

14:13.786 --> 14:17.524

Switzerland ZZ91482S?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.071
No, account numbers
mean nothing

14:31.104 --> 14:32.940
without their passwords,

14:32.973 --> 14:36.209
without the answer
to six security questions.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.212
Was it six?
Thanks. Thought it was five.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.015
What do you want?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.616
Your name, for starters.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.252
V.M. Varga.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.088
What's the "V.M." stand for?

14:49.422 --> 14:52.125
How much and where?

14:52.159 --> 14:54.061
Not sure that
tracks alphabetically.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.228
Look,
if you're gonna be clever,

14:55.262 --> 14:58.298
I'm gonna go
for a nice lie down.

Two million. Lobby of
the Clarion Hotel, 4:00 p.m.

Yeah.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.552
-Hello?
-Yeah.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.821
...hear me?

16:28.855 --> 16:29.989
Hello?

16:30.023 --> 16:32.159
Yeah, it's me. It's Gloria.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.827
Oh, hey, there.
I was just thinking of you.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.197
Yeah? Hey,
let me ask you something.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.166
Yeah, strangest thing,
I'm here on a case.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.568
A new case, just this morning,
a homicide,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.370
and you'll never
guess the vic's name.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.537
[Gloria] When you talked to

16:44.571 --> 16:47.840
this Goldfarb lady
at the restaurant,

16:47.874 --> 16:49.809
she gave you
a full alibi for Emmit.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.845
Yeah, that's it.
Spoke for 20 minutes at least.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.414
Nice lady, real sophisticated.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.016
Said they'd been there
since 6:15 approx,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.485
maybe even 5:55.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.487
Her and Mr. Feltz
and Mr. Stussy,

17:00.520 --> 17:02.822
which, like I said,
you'll never guess what.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.692
Well, thing is,
he just confessed.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.060
-Who?
-Emmit.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.229
Just walked in off the street,
told me the whole story,

17:09.262 --> 17:11.431
even named the murder weapon.
So I'm wondering,

17:11.464 --> 17:14.167
how come this lady alibis him
when he says he's guilty?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.569
It's a puzzler.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.938
Maybe bring her back in
and ask her yourself.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.108
Yeah, sounds right.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.609
Wait, you were
saying something before

17:22.642 --> 17:23.943
about a new homicide?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.912
Yeah. Guy's throat was cut.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.715
They found a piece of glass
on the linoleum.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.849
What guy?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.185
Dentist,
lives on a nice quiet street,

17:32.219 --> 17:33.453
but get this, his name...

17:34.621 --> 17:35.655
Marvin Stussy.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.126
Okay then.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.728
Okay then.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.402
Hey, there.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.570
Hey.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.904
Brought burgers.

17:51.938 --> 17:55.875
Aw. Aren't you sweet?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.076
Ron drive you?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.678
No, took the bus.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.817
So, how's it going?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.320
Good, you know.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.621
Think I might put
this thing to bed.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.656
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.627
Hmm.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.430
You know, I was thinking,

18:17.464 --> 18:18.665
maybe drive up
to the lake this weekend,

18:18.698 --> 18:20.567
do some canoeing?
Like when you were little?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.535
-Mom.
-I know, but it'll be fun.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.572
Rather go to the mall.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.140
The mall?

18:27.174 --> 18:29.008
Yeah, with my friends.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.143
Oh, I was thinking for us.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.180
Okay.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.814
No, no, if you wanna go
to the mall, that's...

18:34.847 --> 18:36.416
Lake sounds...

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
And I know you're not little.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.320
I mean, you're
practically all grown up.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.257
Phone's for you, Chief.
Nope, Deputy.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.992
-Hey, Nathan.
-Hey, Donny.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.361
-[beeps]
-[clears throat]

18:49.529 --> 18:50.363
Burgle.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.132
Oh. hi,
thanks for calling me back.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.804
That'd be great,
if you don't mind.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.038
Really help me out.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.541
Super, see you then.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.112
Due diligence.
Just kicking the tires

19:06.145 --> 19:07.947
on Emmit's alibi witness.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.216
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

19:12.252 --> 19:15.588
Heck, I think I might finally
put this thing to bed.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.725
[siren wailing]

19:43.383 --> 19:45.652
What do we got?

19:45.685 --> 19:48.755
[man] Victim's a white male,
late fifties.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.123
-[beeps]
-[camera clicks]

19:52.292 --> 19:53.860
Wife found him in the kitchen.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.399
Jesus.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.073
Prints?

20:07.106 --> 20:10.243
[man] Yeah, we got a good
one on the fridge.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.612
Moron got glue on his finger
and he wiped it on the door.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.416
What's his name, again?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.217
George.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.289
His last name, asshat.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.558
Stussy.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.459
George Stussy.

20:29.929 --> 20:30.963
Donny?

20:32.299 --> 20:34.066
Yeah, Chief?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.802
Come here,
so I don't have to yell.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.837
[grunts]

20:41.908 --> 20:43.009
I think he pooped.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.144
Check with St. Cloud,

20:45.177 --> 20:47.113
see if they found prints
at their scene.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.815
-That one was a stabbing.
-I know.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.618
-Broken glass, right?
-Yeah.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.122
This one's asphyxiation,
just like Burgle's dad.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.293
I'm thinking he's
alternating his kills

21:00.327 --> 21:02.094
to throw us off the scent.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.496
-Who?
-Killer.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.932
Killer, singular?

21:10.670 --> 21:13.440
This guy must
really hate Stussys.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.277
Chief, neighbor says
she saw a maroon Cadillac

21:18.311 --> 21:20.947
hauling ass out of here right
before the wife got home.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.549
-She get a plate number?
-You betcha.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.653
[rapid piano music playing]

21:44.404 --> 21:46.506
[siren wailing]

21:55.348 --> 21:56.649
About time.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.175
[Gloria] Mrs. Goldfarb?
Thanks again for coming in.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.379
I was very clear with
the other officer last time.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.147
You realize memories fade.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.416
Oh, you'll do great.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.683
Why don't we talk
in my office?

22:35.688 --> 22:38.090
So, like I said, I'm just
checking up on a few things.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.726
We've had some
developments in the case.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.094
And this is a murder?

22:42.128 --> 22:43.496
Yes, ma'am.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.998
Mr. Stussy's brother Raymond,
killed in his own home.

22:46.032 --> 22:46.966
-Awful.
-Hmm.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.403
If you don't mind me asking,

22:50.437 --> 22:51.738
how did you end up
having dinner

22:51.771 --> 22:53.673
with Mr. Feltz and
Mr. Stussy that night?

22:53.706 --> 22:56.609
It was a... A mutual
friend introduced us.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.078
And what was his name?

22:59.111 --> 23:00.580
Buck Olander.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.616
He's a banker. St. Cloud.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.284
So,
this was a business dinner?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.787
Well, I'm new in town
and Buck agreed

23:07.820 --> 23:10.022
to introduce me
to some people.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.090
New from where?

23:11.123 --> 23:12.158
Does it matter?

23:15.394 --> 23:16.563
[chuckles] St. Louis.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.071
And you're aware what happened
to Mr. Feltz, subsequently?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.372
His illness?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.208
I heard. Quel dommage.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.243
When it rains, it pours.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.445
Sometimes it drizzles.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.281
It's a saying.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.718
When it rains, it pours.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.754
Like a penny saved
is a penny earned.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.093
In your statement you said

23:47.126 --> 23:50.162
that Mr. Feltz and Mr. Stussy
arrived separately.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.764
Yes, I think that's right.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.999
Who was first?

23:53.032 --> 23:54.166
Mr. Feltz.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.401
[conversations
get louder outside]

23:55.434 --> 23:56.769
And how soon after...

23:56.803 --> 23:58.270
Um...

23:58.304 --> 23:59.672
How soon after...

23:59.706 --> 24:00.540
After...

24:02.108 --> 24:03.442
-Excuse me a second.
-Yeah.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.112
[Moe] Perp admitted.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.346
Yep. Donny.

24:07.379 --> 24:08.581
[laughs]

24:08.615 --> 24:10.282
-What's up?
-Manhunt's over.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.751
-There was a manhunt?
-Yeah.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.286
For, like, 30 minutes.
Real exciting.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.488
You were right
about this case,

24:15.522 --> 24:17.089
it's a real twister. [laughs]

24:17.123 --> 24:18.625
-I'll let new chief explain.
-My...

24:21.661 --> 24:22.995
Did you tell her, Donny?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.532
Well, I solved it.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.366
Solved what?

24:27.399 --> 24:29.035
Your murders.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.337
The old-timer in Eden Valley
and then the dead PO.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.172
Don't even.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.307
I got the Parking Lot King
in holding, he confessed.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.343
To both?

24:37.376 --> 24:39.512
No, the...

24:39.546 --> 24:40.680
We already established
there's proof

24:40.713 --> 24:42.348
Maurice LeFay killed Ennis,

24:42.381 --> 24:44.517
Ray's parolee, and now Emmit's
basically confirming

24:44.551 --> 24:46.185
that the Ray
murder was tit for tat.

24:46.218 --> 24:49.388
But we have two new murders,
here and St. Cloud,

24:49.421 --> 24:50.990
both surnamed Stussy,

24:51.023 --> 24:53.392
both picture perfect doubles
of your earlier crimes.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.961
Glass-in-the-neck bleed out,

24:54.994 --> 24:56.696
my stiff with his nose
and mouth glued shut.

24:56.729 --> 24:57.964
How about that?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.498
And your theory is what?

24:59.532 --> 25:01.968
A serial killer with two MOs?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.402
-How does...
-Good going, Chief.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.304
-How does that make sense?
-Just listen.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.173
When we arrested
this piece of shit,

25:07.206 --> 25:10.677
he had some mail in his trunk
from your stepdad's house.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.813
Yeah, that's right.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.584
And a framed photo of Ray
and his scofflaw girlfriend

25:17.617 --> 25:19.385
from their domicile.

25:19.418 --> 25:20.987
Also, the trunk,

25:21.020 --> 25:23.089
full of broken glass,
blood, superglue.

25:23.122 --> 25:24.557
Those are facts.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.428
I got... Hold on.
I got different facts.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.163
Maurice LeFay's fingerprints--

25:31.197 --> 25:32.699
He confessed.

25:32.732 --> 25:36.068
My guy. In the car ride over.
All four murders.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.737
-He--
-Cried like a goddamned baby.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.938
You should've seen it.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.108
I mean... [scoffs]

25:42.141 --> 25:44.677
Who the hell is this
out-of-the-blue guy even?

25:44.711 --> 25:45.845
Donald Wu.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.614
Served 22 years
beating a guy's skull in

25:47.647 --> 25:49.181
with a tire iron.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.217
Been out six months,
living under the highway.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.019
Get this.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.689
Said his mom's boyfriend,
named Stussy.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.825
Used to diddle him in
his closet after lights out.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.195
-Chief...
-Mmm-mmm.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.230
No.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.099
You said yourself,

26:07.133 --> 26:09.602
the Parking Lot King's
got a two-witness alibi.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.238
So what you're looking at here
is psychology.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.473
He feels guilty,
all those years

26:14.506 --> 26:16.743
fighting with his
loser brother...

26:16.776 --> 26:19.912
Finally, guilt gets
to him, in he comes.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.213
You believe it

26:21.247 --> 26:22.414
'cause you got
a hard-on for the guy

26:22.448 --> 26:23.616
and you wanna believe it.

26:24.851 --> 26:25.952
Okay?

26:28.420 --> 26:31.523
Cut him loose, Deputy.
We got our man.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.360
That's an order.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.104
Is it gonna be much longer?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.373
I gotta be downtown
in an hour.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.750
No.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.618
No. You can go.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.863
Actually, just so I know,

27:10.897 --> 27:13.599
how soon after Mr. Feltz
did Mr. Stussy arrive?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.967
Five minutes, maybe.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.270
In your statement
you said a half an hour.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.807
Well, I'm sure
that's what it was then.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.742
You know how
the memory can play tricks.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.013
That's another saying.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.685
Are you covering for him?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.389
I'm gonna go.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.659
If you have
any more questions,

27:40.693 --> 27:41.728
let my lawyer know.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.535
[knock on door]

28:23.569 --> 28:25.037
[Meemo] It's done.
They're letting him out.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.342
Doyle'll drive you
to meet the Swango,

28:30.376 --> 28:31.744
I'm moving to stage five.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.007
[chuckles]

29:05.144 --> 29:06.913
Loved you in
Death of a Salesman.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.416
Hilarious.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.994
I'm going to have some tea.
Would you like some tea?

29:22.829 --> 29:23.796
No, thanks.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.566
You know why I
chose this place?

29:27.599 --> 29:28.868
Were you born here?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.538
Don't be mean.
Am I being mean?

29:33.806 --> 29:35.341
We could've used
a real grenade.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.145
No, you're right.
My apologies.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.815
It was the Wildcat Regional.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.951
Third runner up, me and Ray.

29:46.886 --> 29:47.954
That's why we're here.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.457
That's a bridge tournament.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.126
How quaint.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.462
I've never understood this

29:56.495 --> 29:59.165
repulsive affinity
of playing games.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.533
Oh, Bridge isn't a game.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.404
58 octillion possible deals.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.007
Then you got the human factor.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.510
Symbiosis with your partner.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.013
The cheats and tells
of your opponents.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.047
Strategy.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.484
That was my strength.

30:18.517 --> 30:19.886
Yeah, I can tell.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.423
You sure I can't tempt you?

30:26.893 --> 30:28.060
It's my mother's recipe.

30:29.695 --> 30:30.997
No? Well...

30:33.499 --> 30:34.500
You got it?

30:35.767 --> 30:36.768
Yes.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.338
I have it,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.709
but I'd like to offer you
something else instead.

30:45.611 --> 30:46.913
A job.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.154
Remind me what you do again.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.456
I work for
a company called Narwal.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.229
No, you don't.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.264
You tell people you work for
a company called Narwal

31:05.297 --> 31:07.099
'cause people look
past middle management.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.369
But I know
a boss when I see one.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.342
Very good.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.444
You just added
a zero to your salary.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.713
That's okay.

31:21.747 --> 31:22.881
I already got a job.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.751
Blackmailing you.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.686
All right now.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.055
And tell me.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.959
How do you think
that's going to play out

31:32.992 --> 31:35.294
from a strategist's
point of view?

31:37.796 --> 31:40.132
Well,

31:40.166 --> 31:41.900
there's a 60%
chance that briefcase

31:41.934 --> 31:44.636
is full of your
dirty underwear.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.705
And since I don't
see your associate,

31:46.738 --> 31:48.774
I figure he's out there
somewhere watching us.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.110
Maybe even with a rifle.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.013
Go on.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.018
And if I brought the books
and the hard drives with me,

32:00.586 --> 32:02.088
you're gonna give
your man a signal

32:04.023 --> 32:05.157
and he's gonna take the shot.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.928
And did you? Bring them?

32:15.434 --> 32:16.435
The problem is

32:17.869 --> 32:20.472
this is a public place
with a lot of witnesses.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.942
And you're a pretty
distinctive-looking guy.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.013
Am I?

32:30.216 --> 32:31.350
Look around.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.671
Nice.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.142
There, you see,

32:56.175 --> 32:58.177
I'm guessing
the Wildcat Regional

32:58.210 --> 32:59.378
was an amateur affair.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.382
Semi-professional.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.585
[gun cocks]

33:17.396 --> 33:19.231
[beeping in pattern]

33:25.937 --> 33:28.740
See, you got cocky.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.378
Forgot to count
all the pieces on the board.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.614
The cards I'm not showing.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.218
So now it's just me and you.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.221
And I want my money.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.600
You just added another
two zeros to your salary.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.904
What's in the briefcase?

33:58.937 --> 33:59.905
Where are my things?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.175
Well, now, Willy Loman,

34:03.209 --> 34:04.410
I feel I ought to punish you

34:04.443 --> 34:07.213
for not doing
what you were told.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.580
So maybe I share
one of the hard drives

34:08.614 --> 34:09.481
with the police.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.520
You...

34:14.553 --> 34:17.723
You can't win this game,
you do realize that?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.358
I thought you
didn't play games.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.726
I'm offering you a fortune,

34:20.759 --> 34:23.262
you're asking for
a piggy bank, pourquoi?

34:26.132 --> 34:27.399
Because I wanna hurt you.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.236
Not be your pet.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.873
I wanna look you in the face

34:34.906 --> 34:36.642
and rip out
something you love.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.281
I didn't kill him.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.585
You do know that?
It was Emmit.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.853
[chuckles]

34:49.521 --> 34:51.490
Wasn't Emmit who came for me
in the precinct.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.960
Wasn't Emmit
who flipped that bus.

35:00.766 --> 35:01.700
You know,

35:03.502 --> 35:05.471
I didn't have any feeling
about you before,

35:05.504 --> 35:07.773
but now I'm starting
to really dislike you.

35:10.809 --> 35:11.977
Good.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.651
I'll give you till tomorrow
to get my money.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.454
[rock music playing]

35:55.053 --> 35:56.322
You want me to stay?

36:08.334 --> 36:09.501
Should I sit?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.405
[sighs]

36:13.439 --> 36:15.507
Got married
straight out of high school

36:15.541 --> 36:18.377
to a guy I knew
since fifth grade summer camp.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.547
Summer wedding.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.282
Guests were mostly mosquitoes.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.085
We had a baby boy,
then a toddler,

36:28.053 --> 36:29.388
now a teen.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.492
Last year,
my husband phones me at work,

36:33.525 --> 36:35.361
tells me he's got
a boyfriend named Dale.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.563
Says they're
moving in together.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.464
Says he's sorry.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.567
He loves me,
but not like that.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.471
"What else is there?" I say.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.509
You think
the world is something,

36:50.542 --> 36:52.143
then it turns out
to be something else.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.187
You're free to go.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.221
What?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.525
No, I'm...

37:06.558 --> 37:09.761
I told you what happened,
what I did.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.963
I want no special treatment
just 'cause I'm rich.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.299
You treat me like
every other felon.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.267
No, you're not getting it.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.102
Somebody came,
just not who you thought.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.971
What are you talking about?

37:20.005 --> 37:21.740
Since you confessed,

37:21.773 --> 37:24.075
two other fellas named Stussy
have been murdered.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.813
The first with
the copycat approach

37:27.846 --> 37:29.548
mimicking my stepdad.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.084
The second made to look like
your brother's neck puncture.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.587
Whoever it was, planted
evidence in both places

37:35.621 --> 37:38.123
to make it look like all this
is the work of a serial killer

37:38.156 --> 37:39.958
who hates people
surnamed Stussy.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.662
Are you saying
that people are dead

37:43.695 --> 37:45.130
because they've got my name?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.098
Yes.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.436
But the real beauty of it is

37:50.469 --> 37:52.638
they gave us a suspect
and he confessed.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.839
He--

37:53.872 --> 37:55.273
Confessed to all four murders.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.577
Some three-time loser

37:58.610 --> 38:00.312
who couldn't make it
in the modern world.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.913
What must they've paid him?

38:01.947 --> 38:04.082
Must've been
a heck of a price.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.351
But it worked.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.456
That confession, combined with
the evidence I mentioned,

38:10.489 --> 38:12.358
means he goes to prison
the rest of his life

38:12.391 --> 38:13.525
and you go home.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.002
Who is he?

38:27.573 --> 38:29.174
Who?

38:29.207 --> 38:31.176
The master
pulling the strings.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.812
That fella
I met in your office

38:33.845 --> 38:35.180
who said he sold ladies shoes,

38:35.213 --> 38:37.048
this is him, right?

38:37.082 --> 38:38.417

40:32.598 --> 40:37.669
The problem is not that
there is evil in the world,

40:37.703 --> 40:40.138
the problem is
that there is good.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.142
Because otherwise,
who would care?

Reinforcements have arrived.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.346
Whiskey or beer?

41:23.148 --> 41:26.518
Well, you're not supposed to
drink during ovulation,

41:26.552 --> 41:29.621
but at the same time,

41:29.655 --> 41:31.022
if I have to look
that thing in the eye

41:31.056 --> 41:32.190
sober one more time,

41:32.223 --> 41:33.458
I may jump out a window,

and make it ornery.

lumberjacks chopping wood.

41:43.769 --> 41:46.004
Thank God for K-Y.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.173
So when you called,
well, I can't say I was sorry.

and fighting back.

For the present, but we all
know Jesus wins in the end.

I'll drink to that.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.232
You know, before you got here,

42:14.265 --> 42:16.267
I was thinking, see Ennis,
my step-father,

42:16.301 --> 42:18.269
he wrote these space books...

42:18.303 --> 42:19.437
And I read one of 'em.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.342
The Planet Wyh with
the "H" at the end.

42:24.375 --> 42:28.714
And it was about this android,
I guess you call it, who...

42:30.381 --> 42:31.883
His master died
and he wandered

42:31.917 --> 42:34.419
the universe alone
for two million years.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.421
-Jeez.
-Yeah. And...

42:37.889 --> 42:39.725
And all he could
say was, "I can help."

42:41.426 --> 42:44.696
But he couldn't,
or at least he never did.

42:44.730 --> 42:46.331
But he kept on saying it.
"I can help."

42:47.298 --> 42:48.566
And he kept on failing.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.771
Which is,
if I had to define it,

42:52.804 --> 42:54.305
the way I feel most days.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.141
Come on now.

42:56.174 --> 42:57.375
And the other days,

42:57.408 --> 42:59.678
if I'm being honest,
how I feel is...

43:01.512 --> 43:03.514
Invisible. Or not invisible.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.984
Unreal.

43:07.152 --> 43:08.720
Does that make sense?

43:08.754 --> 43:11.056
No, ma'am.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.457
Well, there's the fact
that automatic doors

43:12.490 --> 43:13.925
never open for me,

43:13.959 --> 43:17.062
and the sensors on,
like, the...

43:17.095 --> 43:19.130
The sink or the soap dispenser
never sense me.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.432
And when I make a call,
no one can ever hear me.

43:23.134 --> 43:26.537
So I got this theory,
in private,

43:28.606 --> 43:30.341
that I don't actually exist.

43:40.018 --> 43:41.152
Right.
