WEBVTT

00:09.552 --> 00:11.554
Wow.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.272
What do you think?

00:21.439 --> 00:24.567
I think I'm going to really enjoy
fucking you against this glass.

00:24.776 --> 00:25.860
Is that right?

00:25.944 --> 00:27.654
Yeah, in front
of all the neighbors.

00:27.821 --> 00:29.698
It's always kind of been
a fantasy of mine.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.574
A little higher up
in the fantasy, but--

00:31.741 --> 00:34.327
Oh, okay. What, with my belly
pressed up against the glass?

00:34.452 --> 00:35.537
Exactly.

00:35.704 --> 00:37.622
And those windows
can take it.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.499
- They're double-paned.
- Oh, Jesus.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.167
- Did you see the bathroom?
- Mm-hmm.

00:41.334 --> 00:42.794
Those his-and-his sinks?

00:42.961 --> 00:44.462
- We did, we did.
- Yeah.

00:44.629 --> 00:47.924
I'm telling you,
this building is special.

00:48.091 --> 00:51.094
It's very social.
I've moved a lot of gay couples in.

00:51.261 --> 00:53.430
Oh, no, this one
would just be for me.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.473
But I will be-- I'll be
spending a lot of time here.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.810
It's just that I love my place,
and it's rent-controlled, so...

00:59.018 --> 01:01.604
I don't want
to pressure whomever,

01:01.771 --> 01:05.358
but for the area,
the rent is very reasonable.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.986
I've already had
a lot of inquiries.

01:08.153 --> 01:11.698
Oh. Well, we have
that dinner tonight.

01:11.865 --> 01:14.033
But you said there's
an open house this weekend--

01:14.200 --> 01:15.452
Yeah, I'll take it.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.120
I'll take it.
I love it.

01:17.287 --> 01:19.539
And you know,
you love that window.

01:19.706 --> 01:23.251
Um, how soon
can I sign the lease?

01:23.418 --> 01:26.421
You will be very happy here.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.342
Okay, Johnny is going
to be here in two minutes

01:31.509 --> 01:33.011
- in a black hatchback.
- Ugh.

01:33.178 --> 01:34.679
My mom hates it
when people are late.

01:34.846 --> 01:36.347
- Patrick, look at me. Look at me.
- Yes?

01:36.514 --> 01:38.767
Is there going to be any last-minute
surprises at this dinner?

01:38.933 --> 01:40.643
- What do you mean?
- Like your sister secretly waiting

01:40.810 --> 01:42.437
to pounce on us
like some hairy spider?

01:42.604 --> 01:45.440
No, Megan is still very much
a conscientious objector

01:45.607 --> 01:47.484
to all of this.
She didn't even respond.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.819
Good, 'cause she'll probably
rip my bloody head off.

01:49.986 --> 01:51.821
- You know she de-friended me...
- Yes, I know.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.199
...even though it has
nothing to do with her.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.700
It's between Jon and me.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.202
Well, Jon is
her husband's best friend,

01:57.368 --> 01:59.412
and Megan is a drama queen
and super judgy,

01:59.579 --> 02:01.873
just like my mom,
so I hope you're ready for that.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.875
I am.

02:04.042 --> 02:05.710
Black hatchback.

02:05.877 --> 02:07.545
- Also, Kevin?
- Yeah.

02:07.712 --> 02:11.049
Oh, Patrick, I will
get your mom's name right.

02:11.216 --> 02:12.592
I've been practicing.

02:12.759 --> 02:14.761
It's "Dana,"
rhymes with "banana."

02:14.928 --> 02:16.554
It's the American--
"Dana banana."

02:16.721 --> 02:17.889
- It's Dana-banana.
- Dana-banana.

02:18.056 --> 02:19.808
- Dana-banana.
- No, what I wanted to say was...

02:19.974 --> 02:21.559
- What?
- I'm 30 and I'm too old

02:21.726 --> 02:23.394
to be having this moment,
but I am.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.064
My mom has never met
one of my boyfriends before,

02:26.231 --> 02:29.859
so... I appreciate this.

02:30.026 --> 02:31.444
Thank you.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.489
Well, I'm honored.

02:34.656 --> 02:37.575
And, Patrick, it's going
to be absolutely fine.

02:37.742 --> 02:40.495
I am so fucking good
with moms.

02:44.749 --> 02:47.043
Hey, look who's gracing us
with her presence.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.711
What are you talking about?
I told you this morning

02:48.878 --> 02:51.381
I was gonna come by.
Hey, I need to talk to you, Dom.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.092
- What's up?
- Oh, do you want to come with me

02:54.175 --> 02:56.261
- to pick up the paint swatches?
- Oh, fuck my life!

02:56.427 --> 02:57.595
Moment of the day.

02:57.762 --> 03:00.765
It turns out my Uncle Bunny
is contesting the will after all.

03:00.932 --> 03:02.600
- What?
- I know, I know.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.769
Crotchety old molester, man.
It's unbelievable.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.938
- He's such a fuckin' prick.
- Fuckin' asshole, man.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.357
- Yeah, so that means--
- Oh, shit!

03:09.524 --> 03:11.526
Yeah, it means that we're not
gonna have the money for a while,

03:11.693 --> 03:13.194
'cause the whole case
has to get resolved

03:13.361 --> 03:14.737
and then I have access to it.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.323
So how--
How long will that be?

03:17.490 --> 03:20.785
- Three or four months.
- Four months? Seriously?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.038
My fuckin' family, man.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.040
Shit, man, but I'm maxed out
to the brim,

03:26.207 --> 03:27.667
'cause I was--
I was expecting that money.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.377
I literally have
nothing left, Dor.

03:29.544 --> 03:31.629
I'm-- I have zero cushion.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.798
Okay, I know that.
I didn't do anything.

03:33.965 --> 03:35.633
All right? Take it easy.
It's not my fault.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.803
I'm not saying it's your fault.
I'm just saying I'm fucked.

03:38.928 --> 03:41.431
I'm-- I'm fist-fucked.

03:41.598 --> 03:43.474
- Jesus.
- Take a little breath.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.143
- Take a deep breath, Dom.
- Don't--

03:45.310 --> 03:46.519
- "Take a breath," really?
- We'll be okay.

03:46.686 --> 03:47.854
- I just--
- Just relax.

03:48.021 --> 03:49.355
I just ordered
an industrial fryer

03:49.522 --> 03:51.524
and a giant fucking neon sign,
so just forgive me...

03:51.691 --> 03:53.276
- Yeah, and I'm sorry...
- for being a little upset.

03:53.443 --> 03:54.944
you're gonna have to
put it on hold, it looks like.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.362
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, it doesn't?

03:56.529 --> 03:58.323
- They have a whole new system?
- I can't get them

03:58.489 --> 04:00.575
to un-neon the neon.
Fuck.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.827
I just-- I don't understand
why you would

04:02.994 --> 04:06.497
offer me money that wasn't
actually yours to offer. Jesus.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.207
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

04:08.374 --> 04:09.918
I knew this was
a fucking bad idea.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.920
- Mm.
- Money always fucks things up.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.088
- Does it really? You know what?
- Yeah, it does, always.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.298
You are unbelievable, man.

04:15.465 --> 04:17.175
I'm the only person
in your sorry life

04:17.342 --> 04:18.760
that has ever tried
to do anything--

04:18.927 --> 04:20.261
Oh, your life
is so fucking great?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.931
Okay, my dad just died.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.766
You know-- Oh, my God.
You know what?

04:24.933 --> 04:26.768
Fuck you. Fuck you!

04:26.935 --> 04:29.354
I hope all your dreams
come true.

04:35.193 --> 04:37.195
Taxi! Taxi!

04:39.697 --> 04:40.782
There she is.

04:42.909 --> 04:44.285
Hi, Mom.
Sorry we're late.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.912
The Uber driver
was a nightmare.

04:46.079 --> 04:47.705
Oh, that's all right.

04:47.872 --> 04:50.541
I've been enjoying
my second pineapple <i>royale.</i>

04:50.708 --> 04:52.210
- Oh.
- Hello, dear.

04:52.377 --> 04:53.920
- Hello.
- Mom, you remember Kevin?

04:54.087 --> 04:55.421
Kevin, this is my mom.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.465
It's a pleasure to see you again,
Dana-banana.

04:57.632 --> 04:59.968
My God.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.303
I haven't been called that
in years.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.347
Kevin, you sit over here.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.227
So that's a leather daddy?

05:09.394 --> 05:10.520
Mm-hmm.

05:10.687 --> 05:13.731
And the hope is
this will actually make money?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.566
We didn't-- We didn't do it
to make money, Mom.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.568
We just did it so we could
work on something together.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.445
Something that was ours.

05:19.612 --> 05:23.449
Yeah, but we do own the app,
so if it sells,

05:23.616 --> 05:25.493
this could be a tidy payday.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.495
- Well, hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

05:27.662 --> 05:30.581
And by the way, Patrick, there's
nothing wrong with making money,

05:30.748 --> 05:33.001
especially if it's
doing something you love,

05:33.167 --> 05:34.919
that fulfills you.

05:35.086 --> 05:37.588
How many people
can say that?

05:37.755 --> 05:39.132
I can't.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.218
You're very lucky,
both of you.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.886
Yeah, I agree.

05:44.053 --> 05:47.348
And even though
the last two months

05:47.515 --> 05:49.600
have not been
without drama...

05:49.767 --> 05:52.437
- So I heard.
- Yep, uh...

05:52.603 --> 05:55.356
Well, I think I'm
the luckiest man in the world

05:55.523 --> 05:57.692
to be with your son.

05:57.859 --> 06:01.654
Well, it's always
a bumpy ride, isn't it?

06:03.656 --> 06:04.991
He's lovely.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.703
And he seems to adore you.

06:09.954 --> 06:12.290
Have you said "I love you"
to each other yet?

06:12.457 --> 06:13.708
That's always a thing.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.170
Okay, Mom, has Dr. Sapperstein
adjusted your meds or something?

06:17.336 --> 06:19.297
You're acting
all warm and glowy.

06:19.464 --> 06:21.549
And that's a bad thing?

06:22.967 --> 06:25.887
You know how I love
my Christmas shopping trips

06:26.054 --> 06:27.638
to San Francisco.

06:27.805 --> 06:30.975
And seeing Megan and Gus,
and now you and Kevin,

06:31.142 --> 06:32.643
it makes me happy.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.146
How is Megan?

06:35.313 --> 06:38.483
Well, that's why
I wanted us to chat.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.318
This fight you're having--

06:40.485 --> 06:42.195
No, she's fighting with me.

06:42.361 --> 06:45.198
She has been waging
this cold war on me

06:45.364 --> 06:48.326
ever since Kevin... happened.

06:48.493 --> 06:51.996
Well, Megan has a very strict
moral code. You know that.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.082
Come on,
she cheated on her SATs.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.167
And I think she should want me
to be happy.

06:56.334 --> 06:58.920
Why don't you come
to the zoo with us

06:59.087 --> 07:00.379
and tell her that?

07:00.546 --> 07:03.758
The-- Why are you and Megan
going to the zoo?

07:03.925 --> 07:07.720
I'll tell her you're coming
and I'll broker a <i>rapprochement.</i>

07:07.887 --> 07:09.180
Tomorrow.

07:09.347 --> 07:13.226
Oh, tomorrow.
I-- I can't do tomorrow,

07:13.392 --> 07:15.228
because I told Kevin
I'd help him

07:15.394 --> 07:17.313
look for a new mattress.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.358
Shop early.
You're going.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.027
Okay.

07:23.194 --> 07:27.740
Each side has its own remote.
Zero is soft, 100 is most firm.

07:27.907 --> 07:30.243
- Nice.
- This one likes it nice and hard.

07:31.911 --> 07:35.373
Okay, see what's comfortable.
I'm happy to answer any questions.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.671
Can we leave our shoes on?
I guess so.

07:41.838 --> 07:45.007
No, no, that's fine there.
Have you got your remote?

07:45.174 --> 07:46.342
- Yeah.
- Is it the same?

07:46.467 --> 07:47.760
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.140
I'm at... 75.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.726
Uh-huh. I'm 95
and holding.

07:57.228 --> 07:58.771
You nerd.
You love this, don't you?

07:58.938 --> 08:00.898
It's cool, isn't it?
There's actually a bed here

08:01.065 --> 08:03.234
that has
a zero-gravity function.

08:03.401 --> 08:04.902
Oh.

08:06.404 --> 08:08.781
Hey, you haven't reconsidered
the zoo, have you?

08:09.407 --> 08:10.825
Fuck no.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.535
You go and make peace
with the gorgon,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.245
and then in three or four years,
we'll all get together

08:14.412 --> 08:15.997
and have a nice laugh about it.

08:16.164 --> 08:19.417
Three or four years? I love
that you're thinking long-term.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.004
I wasn't so sure after you didn't
ask me to move in with you.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.549
Well, uh...

08:26.716 --> 08:28.593
I wanted to ask you.

08:28.759 --> 08:32.722
But I wasn't too sure
if you'd think it was too soon

08:32.889 --> 08:35.766
- or crazy.
- Crazy?

08:35.933 --> 08:37.935
Yeah.
Have you running for the hills.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.271
But, uh...

08:40.438 --> 08:44.775
I got that apartment
for us.

08:44.942 --> 08:48.821
You know, I want this bed
to be our bed.

08:48.988 --> 08:50.656
Whenever you're ready.

08:50.823 --> 08:53.868
Wait.
Are you saying--

08:54.035 --> 08:55.286
Well, if I wasn't
so comfortable,

08:55.453 --> 08:57.163
I'd probably get down
on one knee and ask you,

08:57.330 --> 09:00.041
"Patrick Murray,
will you move in with me

09:00.208 --> 09:03.211
and brush your teeth
in the sink next to mine

09:03.377 --> 09:04.629
each morning?"

09:07.423 --> 09:09.050
It's a major step, Kevin.

09:09.217 --> 09:10.551
Yeah. It is, yes.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.512
Ready when you are.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.975
It's a friggin' shelter mural,
not the Museum of Art.

09:18.142 --> 09:19.936
It wasn't my choice
to hire this dude.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.772
- What's good, boy?
- Hey, we have ourselves

09:22.939 --> 09:24.398
- a bit of...
- A clusterfuck

09:24.565 --> 09:26.150
- is what we have, okay?
- Oh!

09:26.317 --> 09:27.443
The artist that we hired
to do this

09:27.610 --> 09:29.904
refuses to work
with the theme of tolerance.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.906
So he quit today,
on a father-fucking voicemail.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.158
Jesus, that sucks.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.494
What am I gonna do?

09:36.661 --> 09:39.413
The donor's gonna come this week
to show her lady friends.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.375
Well, I'm gonna go
tell the kids to stop, all right?

09:42.541 --> 09:43.793
All right.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.294
Argh!

09:45.461 --> 09:47.338
- What are you guys gonna do?
- I don't know.

09:50.383 --> 09:53.552
Hey, so when you started
taking Truvada,

09:53.719 --> 09:56.597
did you have, like,
crazy side effects?

09:57.932 --> 10:01.185
No, just the usual.
What do you mean? Why?

10:01.352 --> 10:03.688
I was just thinking
about starting PrEP,

10:03.854 --> 10:06.023
but I want to make sure
my body's not gonna go into,

10:06.190 --> 10:07.400
like, convulsions or something.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.194
Don't be so <i>telenovela</i>
all the time.

10:10.361 --> 10:12.571
Wait, why PrEP now, though?

10:12.780 --> 10:15.491
Well, you know,
it's the socially-responsible

10:15.658 --> 10:17.576
San-Francisco-gay-man
thing to do.

10:18.536 --> 10:19.912
Right.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.458
You're gonna do this mural.

10:24.542 --> 10:25.751
- Me? No.
- Yeah.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.211
It's for the mother-lovin' community.

10:27.378 --> 10:28.879
It's your duty
as a <i>homo sapien.</i>

10:29.046 --> 10:30.214
No, I don't do
the art thing anymore.

10:30.381 --> 10:31.590
Here's all you gotta do.
Just like...

10:31.674 --> 10:33.384
Maybe paint some
tolerance butterflies up there,

10:33.509 --> 10:34.635
- involve the kids.
- What?

10:34.719 --> 10:35.970
Don't make it sucky.
Badda-bing, badda-boom.

10:36.137 --> 10:37.722
- Hero for a day!
- No, I'm not gonna do it.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.056
- Yes.
- No, I don't want to.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.851
Listen to me, you'll be the biggest
douche bag asshole right now

10:42.018 --> 10:43.769
if you say no to us
when we're in a bind, okay?

10:43.936 --> 10:46.647
So please, thanks.
Thank you.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.488
Sammi? Come here.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.955
Oh, let's take a picture

11:03.122 --> 11:05.750
with the noble bronze jaguar,
shall we?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.084
- Definitely.
- Yes.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.587
Paddy, will you take a photo
of Mommy and me?

11:10.880 --> 11:11.922
Sure.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.593
All right.
Okay, here we go.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.261
Say cheese.

11:17.428 --> 11:19.263
Cheese.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.390
Wait, I'm taking a video.
Sorry.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.641
Ah, can you hurry?
It's cold.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.018
I want to get Mommy
a hot chocolate.

11:24.185 --> 11:25.853
Okay, hold on.
Here we go.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.146
All right, here we go.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.149
One, two, three.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.817
Got it.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.904
Okay, yeah, I'm fine.

11:35.071 --> 11:36.655
No hot chocolate for me.
Thanks for asking.

11:37.448 --> 11:39.617
Oh, aren't you guys
always watching your weight?

11:39.784 --> 11:41.619
With your juice cleansing
and your CrossFit?

11:47.917 --> 11:50.461
Did you want a Xanax, honey?

11:51.504 --> 11:53.506
'Cause I got some.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.801
Sammi's right, okay?
The notion of tolerance,

11:56.967 --> 11:59.470
it's really offensive
when you think about it, okay?

11:59.637 --> 12:02.807
I mean, is that really all these kids
are supposed to strive for?

12:02.973 --> 12:05.476
- And the donor.
- The donor?

12:05.643 --> 12:07.728
The donor
can go fuck herself, okay?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.356
When she sees this, okay?
She's gonna love it.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.359
Come on, Eddie.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.319
You're not gonna deny this
to Sammi, are you?

12:15.486 --> 12:18.447
Look, for the record, emotional
blackmail doesn't really work on me.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.200
You know?
But I have to say,

12:21.367 --> 12:24.578
it's kind of nice to see Miss Havana
Nights got a soul after all.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.914
Oh, well, you're the one
who dug it up.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.708
- Gag me with a spoon.
- Oh, fuck me.

12:31.836 --> 12:33.629
- Wow, what are you doing here?
- Hi.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.173
You just scouting
for rent-boys, or...

12:37.341 --> 12:38.426
How you doin'?

12:38.592 --> 12:41.095
I am-- I'm golden.

12:41.262 --> 12:43.514
- Great.
- Yeah, how are you?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.307
I'm good.
I'm really good.

12:45.474 --> 12:49.478
Um, I'm working, actually,

12:49.645 --> 12:52.231
at a shelter
for the youth-- for--

12:52.398 --> 12:53.941
for the-- for homeless youth.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.943
Mm-hmm.

12:56.694 --> 12:58.404
- No more art.
- Hmm.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.073
I took someone's
very strong suggestion.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.409
Is that right?

13:04.702 --> 13:07.455
Oh, uh, this is my friend, Eddie.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.540
Hi, I'm his friend, Eddie.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.709
- Hey, Eddie, I'm Frank.
- I know who you are.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.294
All right.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.921
So what, am I famous, or...

13:16.088 --> 13:18.591
Something like that.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.384
So no more art, huh?

13:20.551 --> 13:22.428
Oh, no,
actually this isn't me.

13:22.595 --> 13:25.055
Agustín has been mentoring one
of the trans teens in our shelter,

13:25.222 --> 13:28.559
and I have to say,
he's pretty amazing with them.

13:32.730 --> 13:36.233
Okay, so who are you and what
have you done with Agustín?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.612
Hey, it's a new day.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.908
Yeah, I can see that.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.911
Well, I should skedaddle.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.079
Let's get together sometime, okay?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.248
Yeah, sure.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.209
Absolutely.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.806
She could make some tweaks,
but it's good, right?

14:10.768 --> 14:13.437
Mom, I don't think you should
be feeding the animals.

14:13.604 --> 14:17.233
Honey, these are quinoa chips
from Whole Foods.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.609
Okay.

14:18.776 --> 14:22.530
And since when do you care
about doing the right thing?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.532
Okay, let's just do this.
Let's just talk about

14:24.740 --> 14:27.451
the proverbial elephant
in the room.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.119
Your narcissism?

14:29.286 --> 14:31.247
- Megan.
- Oh, Mommy, I'm kidding.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.499
- Patrick knows I'm kidding.
- All right.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.460
Look, I know what the problem is,
but why is it your problem?

14:36.627 --> 14:38.254
Why do you have any opinion
about it?

14:38.420 --> 14:40.756
- Because one, I'm a moral person.
- Oh, really?

14:40.923 --> 14:42.299
And because I come home
every night after work

14:42.466 --> 14:44.677
and I see Gus sitting there

14:44.843 --> 14:47.221
with this sweet, lovely man
who has absolutely no idea

14:47.388 --> 14:49.181
how or why his life imploded.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.683
Really, Patrick.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.977
Have you thought about
what Jon's going through?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.478
Yes, I think about it
all the time,

14:54.645 --> 14:56.480
and I feel like shit
that he's upset.

14:56.647 --> 14:57.815
Upset?

14:57.982 --> 14:59.984
Look, I didn't ask Kevin
to break up with Jon, okay?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.653
- That was his decision.
- Then your boyfriend's an asshole.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.155
Because he wanted to leave
an unhappy relationship?

15:05.322 --> 15:06.907
They were unhappy, Megan.
Both of them.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.368
Okay, well, so instead
of telling him that

15:09.535 --> 15:12.830
and trying to work through it,
he just announces, "I'm leaving you"?

15:12.997 --> 15:15.833
I mean, who does that?
Without even a conversation?

15:16.041 --> 15:18.669
I think Kevin thought a clean break
was the best way to go about it.

15:18.836 --> 15:20.671
- Yeah, and you could have said no.
- I--

15:20.838 --> 15:22.214
- You could have said no to Kevin.
- I did!

15:22.381 --> 15:25.134
I tried to,
but life is messy, okay?

15:25.301 --> 15:27.511
Maybe not your life
down in the Peninsula,

15:27.678 --> 15:29.513
but you're just gonna
have to get over this, Megan,

15:29.680 --> 15:31.098
because this is happening.
I'm with Kevin

15:31.265 --> 15:33.017
and hopefully for a long time.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.352
Oh, you think so?
You think you two are forever?

15:35.519 --> 15:40.024
I have no idea, but he...
just asked me to move in with him.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.192
- Oh, wow!
- So...

15:42.359 --> 15:44.862
Oh, so he's that guy.
Got it.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.947
Why didn't you tell me that
last night?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.699
It just happened, Mom.
Just this morning.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.993
It's a bit fast, isn't it?

15:51.160 --> 15:54.038
- I haven't said yes yet.
- Well, maybe you should say no.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.041
You're not giving up
your apartment, are you?

15:57.207 --> 16:00.210
I-- Mm...
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.421
But whether or not Kevin and I
move in with each other,

16:02.588 --> 16:04.256
the point is that
he's gonna be around.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.966
And if we're gonna be
in each other's lives, you're--

16:06.050 --> 16:08.677
Don't you even think about bringing
him around at Christmas.

16:08.844 --> 16:12.056
Oh, my God. Mom, if there was ever
a time for a <i>rah-prochement...</i>

16:13.557 --> 16:16.602
Isn't it a little different
when it's two men, Megan?

16:16.769 --> 16:18.562
Oh God, Mom.

16:18.729 --> 16:22.107
Oh my God, I am so sick
of that double standard.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.443
I am so over Patrick
getting away--

16:24.610 --> 16:26.612
getting a free pass
because he's gay.

16:26.779 --> 16:28.072
Pardon me?

16:28.238 --> 16:31.575
You get to not give Mom and Dad kids,
because you're gay.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.744
You get to live with your friends
in San Francisco

16:33.911 --> 16:36.455
chasing your bliss and working on
your video games because you're gay.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.791
You get to break up a relationship
because you're fucking gay.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.584
Okay, you know what?
My life is nothing like that.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.253
And even if it were, you would have
no right to judge me or my choices

16:43.420 --> 16:44.922
based on the way
that you and Gus live.

16:45.089 --> 16:47.716
You can't feed
the animals, ma'am.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.927
They take
a special savannah diet.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.137
It's okay, I'm done.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.972
Thank you.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.933
Me, too.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.275
It's pronounced <i>rapprochement.</i>

17:06.694 --> 17:08.987
- Thank you.
- And that wasn't it.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.450
Dor?

17:22.292 --> 17:24.712
Dor, you home?

17:24.878 --> 17:27.297
I brought a peace offering.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.966
Yeah?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.719
It's cake-batter flavor.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.804
It's the one that makes you
puddle in your panties.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.764
Oh, I'm not really in the mood
for Froyo, thanks.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.516
I put the pink salt,
how you like.

17:37.683 --> 17:38.809
Yeah, no thank you.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.812
Come on, Dor.
I'm saying I'm sorry.

17:43.147 --> 17:45.065
You know how I am
when people try to help me.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.859
I turn into
a fucking crazy person.

17:48.819 --> 17:51.989
Yeah, well, it's me, Dom.
You know, it's me.

17:52.156 --> 17:53.657
I know.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.325
I know.
I'm sorry.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.202
I am.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.914
Listen, you know
what you started to say earlier?

18:01.081 --> 18:04.168
You're right. You're the only one
who ever really supported me.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.378
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

18:06.545 --> 18:07.921
I have.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.382
I have been your person, right?

18:10.549 --> 18:12.301
I've been your person

18:12.468 --> 18:15.679
for the last 20 fucking years.

18:15.846 --> 18:18.307
And it's not-- It's-- It's--

18:18.474 --> 18:20.684
It's too much.
It's not good.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.978
Are you jealous of Malik?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.564
Oh, that is fucking ridiculous.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.192
I encouraged the two of you
to be together, so...

18:29.610 --> 18:31.028
You know what?

18:31.195 --> 18:33.030
We're both damaged.
We're both damaged.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.365
We don't know how
to be adults.

18:35.532 --> 18:39.536
You know,
I prioritize... you over Malik.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.914
And when I--
When I don't do that,

18:42.080 --> 18:43.707
I feel guilty about it.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.168
If this keeps
going on like this,

18:46.335 --> 18:48.170
you know, we're gonna be
70 years old,

18:48.337 --> 18:51.215
stuck in this apartment,
still talking about fucking Froyo.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.926
Where are you going?

18:54.092 --> 18:55.928
I'm gonna stay at Malik's.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.139
I don't feel like
I can be here right now.

19:00.808 --> 19:02.935
What do you mean
you can't be here?

19:03.101 --> 19:05.020
We're a codependent mess.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.315
A fag and his hag.

19:16.198 --> 19:20.536
I would let you
work this out

19:20.702 --> 19:22.704
in your own time,

19:23.664 --> 19:27.960
but I suspect
you'll want to be united

19:28.126 --> 19:31.588
for what I'm about
to tell you.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.925
Oh, my God.
Are you sick?

19:35.092 --> 19:36.301
Is Daddy sick?

19:36.468 --> 19:38.846
No, we're both fine.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.681
What is it then?

19:43.976 --> 19:46.645
The simplest version

19:47.271 --> 19:51.441
is that I'm thinking
of leaving your father.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.861
What?

19:54.611 --> 19:57.489
What do you mean, leaving?
Leaving as in, like, divorce?

19:57.614 --> 20:00.284
What happened?
Why-- Did Daddy do something?

20:00.450 --> 20:03.662
No, nothing happened.
Nobody did...

20:04.788 --> 20:07.291
Do you remember Dr. Alexander?

20:08.709 --> 20:11.378
His wife Julie
passed away last year?

20:11.545 --> 20:14.381
Mrs. Alexander is dead?

20:14.548 --> 20:17.759
It was a very difficult time
for Dennis.

20:17.926 --> 20:22.472
And I helped him through it.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.810
And something started.

20:26.977 --> 20:29.479
Not physically.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.149
Not yet.

20:32.316 --> 20:35.068
But emotionally.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.071
I-- I don't understand, Mom.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.532
Are you unhappy with Dad?

20:40.699 --> 20:44.453
No, not unhappy, but...

20:46.371 --> 20:49.791
yearning for something else.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.294
Something more.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.550
Can I just say

20:58.717 --> 21:03.221
I think it is beautiful
that you were there for Dennis,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.766
but, like, who's gonna
be there for Daddy

21:05.933 --> 21:08.018
when you drop
this bombshell on him?

21:08.185 --> 21:11.355
Honey, your father
can take care of himself.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.065
Believe me.

21:13.231 --> 21:16.944
I have to try
to honor my truth.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.987
Oh, God.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.282
What about the truth
of your marriage?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.743
What about honoring that?

21:24.952 --> 21:27.913
You've been married
how many months now?

21:28.080 --> 21:29.373
Three?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.542
You'll find, Megan,

21:32.709 --> 21:34.753
that the longer
you're with someone,

21:34.920 --> 21:38.256
the more complicated
that truth becomes.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.925
You--

21:40.676 --> 21:43.053
you can't just
leave Dad, Mom.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.726
If someone makes me happy...

21:50.769 --> 21:53.730
and he wants to be with me,

21:53.897 --> 21:56.775
and I want to be with him,

21:56.942 --> 21:59.236
I shouldn't do anything?

22:00.362 --> 22:02.531
I should stay?

22:14.543 --> 22:17.004
I support you, Mom.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.423
Whatever you need.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.884
We... support you.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.304
Thank you.

22:44.531 --> 22:48.618
So... it was really weird
seeing Frank, huh?

22:49.661 --> 22:50.871
Not really.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.497
Please.

22:52.664 --> 22:56.168
He's really fucking hot,
by the way.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.878
Okay.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.465
By the way,
you know what else was awkward?

23:01.631 --> 23:04.760
That "This is my friend Eddie" thing.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.223
What was awkward about that?

23:10.390 --> 23:12.809
I'm just your friend?

23:13.727 --> 23:16.897
You know, you don't get
to have it both ways, Eddie.

23:17.064 --> 23:18.982
You said over and over
that we can mess around,

23:19.149 --> 23:21.068
but nothing more, right?
You said that.

23:21.234 --> 23:24.071
So what am I
supposed to call you?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.365
Can you just admit that you saw
your fucking gorgeous ex-boyfriend

23:27.532 --> 23:29.785
and you got a little
turned up inside?

23:29.951 --> 23:31.995
You figured it out, Eddie.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.747
What?

23:33.914 --> 23:37.000
I'm getting really tired of having
to persuade you that I'm into you.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.169
- Okay?
- Okay, calm down.

23:41.671 --> 23:45.258
I've liked you
since the moment that I met you,

23:45.425 --> 23:48.720
since we got into the river,
and we took all our clothes off,

23:48.887 --> 23:50.555
and you smiled at me.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.267
I do have a winning smile.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.686
I want to be your boyfriend.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.022
What do I have to do?

23:59.189 --> 24:01.525
You want me to go to the top
of Twin Peaks and yell it out?

24:01.691 --> 24:03.276
I'll do it.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.529
You're not going
to get me up there.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.239
Not in these shoes.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.618
I need to hear you say it.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.959
Agustín...

24:20.085 --> 24:23.547
Javier Christopher...

24:23.713 --> 24:26.007
Lanuez...

24:27.384 --> 24:29.511
will you please
be my boyfriend?

24:31.596 --> 24:33.431
Yeah?

24:39.104 --> 24:42.232
Javier and "Christober"
are not my middle names.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.568
You sure?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.069
Fuck.

24:54.578 --> 24:56.413
These are the kind Dad likes,
I think.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.166
Dark chocolate with mint.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.335
Very sweet of you
to remember that.

25:07.841 --> 25:11.011
Honey, give Megan time.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.096
She'll accept Kevin.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.390
I hope so.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.603
I really love him, Mom.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.359
Are you disappointed in me?

25:26.526 --> 25:27.986
No.

25:28.987 --> 25:32.574
No, just... confused,
I guess.

25:32.741 --> 25:36.786
I mean, you do...
or you did

25:37.913 --> 25:39.915
love Dad, right?

25:40.081 --> 25:42.292
It wasn't all bullshit?

25:42.459 --> 25:43.793
What?

25:43.960 --> 25:47.130
The last 40 years
of my life?

25:49.090 --> 25:53.303
I'm not proud of all
the choices I've made, Patrick,

25:53.470 --> 25:56.473
but they were my choices.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.892
Not your father's,

25:59.059 --> 26:01.561
not my parents' choices.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.438
So no,

26:03.605 --> 26:07.651
it has not
all been bullshit.

26:07.817 --> 26:11.655
You and Megan are not,
excuse me, bullshit.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.369
What are you gonna do?

26:19.162 --> 26:21.831
I have no fucking idea.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.667
Mom?

26:23.833 --> 26:25.835
There's my car.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.505
Mom? Well...

26:39.307 --> 26:41.101
- See you and Kevin soon.
- Okay.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.811
- Christmas, I hope.
- Yeah.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.730
We'll all have
such a lovely time.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.694
I--

27:14.551 --> 27:15.677
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.929
I want to do this.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.848
I want to move in with you,

27:20.015 --> 27:23.435
and be with you,
and spend Christmas with you here.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.146
Just the two of us.
