01:00.561 --> 01:03.428
I can smell that hot blood
just under your skin.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.062
And, cowboy, you smell awesome.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.224
-Fuck you.
-That can be arranged.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.984
But I'm gonna kill you first.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.588
Old teacher's pet was scared.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.134
Yeah, he got you, dude.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.463
Yeah, I was scared.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.924
Vampires are scary.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.838
Oh, how's that lip?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.473
It's okay.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.020
How's your nose?

01:46.940 --> 01:53.106
-Vampires are not a joke.
-No sense of humor.

01:59.703 --> 02:03.537
There's a war going on.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.038
And you're either on the dark side...

02:08.211 --> 02:10.372
...or you're on the side of the light.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.380
And there ain't no in-between.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.295
I think you broke my nose.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.448
I'm so sorry, Vampire Bill.
I know how this must look.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.152
-Get out of my house.
-Bill, do not hurt him.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.817
I swear, I wouldn't have let it
go any further.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.327
I said, get out of my house.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.488
-lt's my house too.
-Jessica, upstairs.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.749
-Okay, let's all just try to calm down.
-That's a really good idea.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.581
Are you gonna leave
or am I gonna have to throw you out...

04:15.756 --> 04:17.587
...through a window that is closed?

04:17.758 --> 04:20.750
-Bill, that is just rude.
-Sookie, I've got this.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.669
I'm going. I'm going.

04:24.514 --> 04:28.098
-I wasn't gonna do nothing.
-lt's not her that I'm protecting, son.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.365
I don't believe him for a minute.

04:54.878 --> 04:59.542
We established there was to be
no hunting in this house.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.174
Look, I know you feel like shit
because you had to make me...

05:03.345 --> 05:04.881
...and you should feel like shit.

05:05.764 --> 05:09.552
But guess what? I'd never even kissed
a boy before that.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.060
Meeting Hoyt's the only good thing
that's happened to me...

05:14.231 --> 05:16.062
...since my whole new life started.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.938
No, I'm not ready
for anything to happen too fast.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.194
I'd have been happy just to go on
kissing him all night long.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.900
Now, is it my fault my fangs come out
when | get turned on?

05:43.051 --> 05:45.838
I think I'm gonna like her.

05:46.012 --> 05:50.346
Sookie, do not make the mistake
of thinking you two can be girlfriends.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.850
-She is--
-Yeah, I get it. She's a vampire.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.352
Believe me,
I learned my lesson about that.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.105
But, Bill, I think we should take her
with us to Dallas.

05:59.276 --> 06:03.110
I think it would be good for you
because I think, deep down...

06:03.280 --> 06:06.113
...you don't like vampires,
even though you are one.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.739
So?

06:07.909 --> 06:10.241
Well, hating yourself is a bad thing.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.074
I am a vampire.
I am supposed to be tormented.

06:14.249 --> 06:18.208
You're not just a vampire.
And Jessica doesn't have to be either.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.962
You can teach her how to walk that line
between vampire and human.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.963
Yes, because I have mastered that.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.547
Okay, so you can teach each other.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.340
It's so different for her.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.894
When I was made, one had no choice...

06:42.068 --> 06:46.186
...but to live completely outside
the human world...

06:46.489 --> 06:48.480
...as an outlaw...

06:48.992 --> 06:50.732
...a hunter.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.074
Humans were prey and nothing else.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.412
I envy her.

07:05.842 --> 07:11.508
I'll need to call the airline to arrange
for two travel coffins instead ofjust one.

07:12.599 --> 07:17.844
Isn't it exciting? Our first trip together.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.770
Oh, come on, Bill.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.227
l was almost killed last night.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.312
Again.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.186
At least give me this.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.454
-So you do this a lot?
-Swim?

07:41.628 --> 07:44.620
Well, at night.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.084
Actually, I do.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.041
I love when it's dark.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.132
You have to focus
on all your other senses.

07:53.306 --> 07:59.142
It's amazing what you can feel when
you take away the "looking at things" part.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.725
I think it's also
because there's no people here.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.935
Ain't no boats.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.274
No car stereos blasting crap music.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.402
Nobody saying stupid things way too loud
because of drink.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.992
Just the world.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.413
Like it was when
it was brand-spanking new.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.752
It is kind of paradise, Bon Temps.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.163
This little old hick town?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.252
Why not?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.759
There's not a hell of a lot to do,
for one thing.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.760
So there's less to distract you...

08:34.931 --> 08:37.263
...from just being where you are
when you're there.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.430
What about the aggressively
ignorant people that live here?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.936
Who are very loyal clientele.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.816
Listen, they decide they like a place,
they stop looking for anywhere else to go.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.399
-And they like to drink.
-What are you, president of the Jaycees?

08:51.865 --> 08:56.655
No, I'm just a guy
who likes where he lives.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.747
Home sweet home, huh?

09:01.458 --> 09:04.325
Yeah. I thought it was.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.585
I don't know,
I might be heading off soon.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.632
-Where to?
-Someplace probably a lot like this.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.256
Cities bring out
the worst in people.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.425
They lose touch with nature.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.685
It's where they come from.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.806
People do that here too.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.815
Not in the same way.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.817
My fingertips are turning into raisins
and | feel like pancakes.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.704
There's a 24-hour truck stop
out on l-20 toward Arcadia...

09:42.874 --> 09:44.830
...makes the best sweet potato pancakes.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.036
You know it?

09:46.211 --> 09:48.327
Do you wanna come with me?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.496
Well, I'm-- ljust--

09:50.673 --> 09:52.755
I'm not really that hungry.

09:53.551 --> 09:56.884
Sam, if you're worried
about me seeing you naked...

09:57.055 --> 09:59.011
...l have seen boy parts before.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.973
Water ain't exactly opaque.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.865
I promise I'll start looking
for my own place as soon as--

10:23.039 --> 10:27.453
I asked you to move in,
not crash for a few days. You're family.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.289
A limo is picking me up at 5 today, so--

10:30.463 --> 10:32.374
I'm on my way.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.337
-Love you the most.
-Love you more.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.634
-Who do you love the most?
-SooMe.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.677
What do you have planned today?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.813
I think I'm gonna be taking off.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.895
You're taking off work? Fabulous.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.697
No, I'm gonna go live with Sookie.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.027
I'm very sorry to hear that.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.739
Me being here was always
supposed to be temporary.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.995
Everything's temporary, Tara.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.328
I don't really wanna dance
right now, okay?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.874
Of course.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.299
What happened? You fit so well here...

11:18.469 --> 11:22.337
...and you seemed to be having
so much fun last night.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.598
I think everybody was having
a little too much fun last night.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.099
Will you tell Eggs I left?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.610
Sure.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.741
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.829
Thank you so much for everything.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.245
I'm sure you'd do the same for me.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.501
Go, flourish.

12:01.679 --> 12:05.388
And don't every say no
to yourself, okay?

12:15.360 --> 12:18.318
I don't know who Lazarus was...

12:18.488 --> 12:20.399
...but he was not the first vampire.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.110
Everybody knows it was Dracula.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.282
It's in the Bible, moron.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.403
Jesus brought Lazarus
back from the dead.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.572
80 Jesus made the first vampire?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.456
Maybe Jesus was the first vampire.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.042
I mean, he rose from the dead too.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.580
And he told people,
"Hey, y'all, drink my blood.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.749
lt'll give you special powers."

12:40.927 --> 12:42.167
Jesus never said that.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.336
No, the first vampire was Cain.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.175
Being a vampire is the mark of Cain.

12:46.349 --> 12:50.183
It's God's punishment for bringing the first
evil into the world by killing his brother.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.517
No, the first evil
was Eve eating the apple.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.311
That's why they call it "evil."

12:57.485 --> 13:01.194
That wasn't evil.
That was just skirting the rules.

13:01.364 --> 13:05.528
Evil is making the premedicated choice
to be a dick.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.159
Jason Stackhouse,
please meet Reverend New/in...

13:08.329 --> 13:12.538
...outside the administration ofﬁces.
Jason Stackhouse.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.295
There's one thing you can count on:

13:19.465 --> 13:21.626
God will make sure evil gets punished.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.543
Yeah? Then explain Europe to me.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.551
Morning.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.725
Ain't she a beauty?

13:37.275 --> 13:39.391
Let's you and me
take a little trip together.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.739
-Am I in trouble?
-We're all in trouble, Jason...

13:45.908 --> 13:47.990
...as long as there are vampires
in the world.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.880
I still haven't moved into Gran's room,
but you take mine...

14:02.050 --> 14:06.419
...and when | get back,
we'll celebrate properly.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.339
Until then, happy birthday.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.976
Oh, Sook.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.021
I miss her so much.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.568
I know.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.203
I do too.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.877
So why'd y'all pick Dallas for your trip?

14:45.718 --> 14:48.755
Bill has some business there.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.548
Oh, hell, do those vampires wanna use
your mind reading again?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.557
I'll have Bill there to protect me.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.640
Why are you even with this guy
if he makes you do these things?

14:58.815 --> 15:00.305
The sex can't be that good.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.973
Oh, it's pretty good.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.312
-And I love him.
-Well, yeah, but--

15:04.487 --> 15:08.230
You can'tjust sit around saving your heart
for some perfect idea of a man...

15:08.408 --> 15:12.777
...who's never gonna come along.
Life is too damn short.

15:12.954 --> 15:16.742
Besides, Bill's not
making me do anything.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.454
I agreed to this to save your fool cousin,
thank you very much.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.913
Lafayette?

15:22.839 --> 15:25.330
-He didn't tell you?
-Tell me what?

15:25.508 --> 15:28.545
I didn't even know he was back.
Is he okay?

15:28.719 --> 15:31.426
I heard there's been panther sightings
in Natchitoches.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.384
These are too wide for a panther.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.426
I can tell you this:
There's some nasty poison in that wound.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.309
My guess is it paralyzed her.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.688
And she was alive when they took the heart
and that's what killed her.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.191
-So it was an animal?
-That did that? Definitely.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.603
The chest was carved up
with a knife though.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.317
Yeah, I got real clear incisions.

15:50.491 --> 15:54.279
So unless you can think of an animal
that can wield a hunting knife....

15:54.454 --> 15:57.196
We are looking at
a human-animal collaboration.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.364
Bud, that doesn't make any sense.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.409
l was making what people
with actual senses of humor...

16:02.587 --> 16:04.873
-...refer to as a joke.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.335
A black woman is paralyzed
and then butchered to death...

16:08.509 --> 16:10.716
...in the town where | live.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.468
I didn't realize that was funny.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.048
Kenya, I wanna ask about the pig...

16:16.225 --> 16:19.058
...I seen in this report you wrote up
after Tara's car wreck.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.890
Andy, what are you doing
looking through those files?

16:22.440 --> 16:26.149
Okay, well, I'm going to the gym.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.061
Been spending some time
with my shirt off recently.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.730
So you guys lock up after me, okay?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.697
-Did you get a good look at that pig?
-There wasn't any pig.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.953
Tara was so drunk
she drove off the road.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.159
-She was just making up shit.
-Was it brown?

16:41.334 --> 16:44.292
Because I've seen that pig,
in a dollhouse.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.248
Andy, you're drunk. On the job.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.037
I ain't drunk.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.252
You never had a beer
in the middle of the day?

16:50.426 --> 16:52.917
-l'm not an alcoholic.
-You're just a dumb, old man...

16:53.095 --> 16:55.256
...who don't know anything
about nothing.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.012
That's not cool, Andy.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.844
I know.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.348
-l'm sorry, Bud.
-I know you are.

17:03.523 --> 17:08.108
But I need to count on you in this job
and I can't do that if you're drinking.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.893
-Give me your badge.
-Hell, no.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.772
No.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.308
I know you in there,
even if you won't pick up the phone.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.979
Damn, hooker. Shit.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.706
How come I have to hear about you
from Sookie?

18:05.876 --> 18:08.162
-What else she tell you?
-That you got shot...

18:08.337 --> 18:10.828
...and fed on and chained up
in some vampire dungeon.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.623
Sookie need to keep her mouth shut
and so do you.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.083
Have you been to the hospital?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.546
What you think gonna happen if I show up
to the ER with a gun wound?

18:19.724 --> 18:23.182
-I don't need the police up in my business.
-You need to see a doctor.

18:23.352 --> 18:27.186
For what? So they can give me drugs
I already got?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.432
I done left a message
on Uncle Cyrus' voicemail.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.441
I'm gonna be okay.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.945
Well, I'm gonna stay here and make sure
you're taken care of.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.316
-Oh, no, you're not.
-|t's my birthday.

18:39.493 --> 18:43.202
Hooker, look, I'm not in the partying mood
right now, okay?

18:43.372 --> 18:46.205
You don't have to do anything.
l'll sit and watch TV with you.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.867
Bitch, look, you know I love you,
all right?

18:50.046 --> 18:53.379
| just spent two and a half weeks
thinking I'm gonna die at any second.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.792
I ain't got it in me
to take care of you tonight, all right?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.467
If you die, I'm gonna be really pissed.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.226
Well, that makes the two of us.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.776
-I thought you was leaving?
-Haven't left yet.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.365
-You ain't leaving?
-It means I haven't left yet.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.747
-So you are leaving?
-I haven't left yet.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.329
Dumb-ass.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.378
Are there any lunch specials?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.833
I think I got everything
I need to make Jailhouse Chili.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.094
Are you sure? Because last time,
you forgot the corn chips.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.925
Shit!

19:45.434 --> 19:47.220
Right.

19:47.395 --> 19:51.013
We'll just call
whatever this turns out to be...

19:51.190 --> 19:52.896
...Terry's Scramble.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.023
Scrambled Terry's Scramble.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.604
Hush.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.445
ljust don't know if I can do it, Sookie.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.776
Do what?

20:02.118 --> 20:05.076
Run this place when Sam leaves town.
It's too much pressure.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.910
-Sam's leaving town?
-Supposed to be this morning.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.793
Sam, were you gonna tell me
you were leaving?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.248
You weren't here.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.093
Where are you going?

20:29.812 --> 20:32.144
Oh, for Pete's sake, Sam.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.806
I know it seems like I led you on,
but cut me some slack.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.818
My grandmother had just been murdered,
Rene was after me...

20:38.988 --> 20:43.357
-...and I didn't think Bill was coming back.
-Sookie, I really don't have time for this.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.526
If you care about our friendship,
I suggest you make time for it.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.071
Look, I got serious shit
that I'm dealing with right now.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.615
Making you feel better
is not high on my list.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.502
Yeah? Well, I got serious shit
that I'm dealing with too.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.957
And because of some of that shit,
I'm gonna need to take off a couple days.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.090
Fine. I probably won't be here
when you get back.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.176
Is that really how
you wanna leave things?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.476
What other way is there?

21:09.643 --> 21:12.885
I don't know, Sam,
but just throwing away years of friendship...

21:13.063 --> 21:15.805
...seems pretty damn stupid to me.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.860
-All right!
-Oh, yeah!

21:26.243 --> 21:28.199
-Get ready. Here we go.
-Watch this.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.281
Yeah!

21:30.456 --> 21:32.117
Mr. Vampire?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.032
You're gone.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.878
You're gone.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.883
How do you like me now,
you scared-ass motherfuckers?

21:46.222 --> 21:47.302
Sorry.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.680
You are one hell of a shot, boy.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.341
We ought to give you wooden bullets
instead of silver.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.433
-No. Silver bullets are way cooler.
-Silver bullets won't kill a vampire.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.814
They'll just bring him down
so he can be staked.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.316
Shoot a fanger in the heart
with a wooden bullet...

22:01.487 --> 22:03.773
...you are staking him right there.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.405
Makes them explode. So I hear.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.946
No. Theyjust kind of fall apart.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.532
It's like a water balloon.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.246
What, you've seen it?

22:15.751 --> 22:18.037
Damn, I'm jealous.

22:18.212 --> 22:22.046
Oh, that's gotta be a sight,
watching God's awesome power...

22:22.216 --> 22:26.175
...just obliterate evil
right in front of your eyes.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.761
One day.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.632
One day soon.

22:33.602 --> 22:36.594
For young Rafael Cordoba,
it was the beginning...

22:36.772 --> 22:39.263
...of the longest day of his life.

22:39.441 --> 22:43.275
Rafael first ran with the Pamp/ona bulls
the week after he turned 18...

22:43.445 --> 22:45.936
...foI/owing in the footsteps
of his older brothers...

22:46.115 --> 22:48.857
...and had run ﬁve consecutive runs
Without a scratch.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.774
-Hello?
-He had no reason to expect...

22:50.953 --> 22:52.739
...this run would go any differently.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.950
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

23:34.371 --> 23:36.236
Surprise.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.326
Oh, did we scare you?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.833
Yes. Oh, my God.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.331
What are y'all--?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.757
Nobody should spend their birthday alone.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.335
How'd you even know?

23:47.509 --> 23:50.546
-Kitchen?
-Oh, it's through there.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.504
This way, this way.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.265
Hey, what were you crying about?

23:57.436 --> 24:00.098
| always cry on my birthday.

24:00.439 --> 24:04.603
It's always the worst day.
No matter what I do, | end up crying...

24:04.777 --> 24:06.483
...because my birthday always sucks.

24:07.071 --> 24:11.360
Well, this is the year that changes.
I promise you that.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.373
We had been planning this party
for days...

24:18.540 --> 24:21.828
...but you threw a major monkey wrench
into things by moving out.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.285
Was that a wedding cake?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.704
Wedding, birthday,
what's the difference?

24:27.383 --> 24:30.250
It's all about casting off
the empty shell of what's dead...

24:30.427 --> 24:33.510
...and embracing the mysteries
of what is yet to come.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.639
We are gonna have a wicked good time.
I can feel it in my bones.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.926
I've been on the phone all day
calling all your friends.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.265
What friends?

24:44.733 --> 24:46.985
-Hey, honey?
-Yes.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.653
-Two Buds, please.
-Two beers?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.186
Is that good?

24:50.364 --> 24:52.901
We need the day off,
so we can have a beer and relax.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.235
All right.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.072
One, two.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.782
-Thanks, honey.
-|t's really good.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.571
-Here, cheers.
-Cheers.

25:00.749 --> 25:04.333
-So how's it going? You having fun?
-This is just great.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.620
-Do you like country music?
-I can't get enough of it.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.585
Yeah? Mostly I listen to....

26:09.318 --> 26:10.649
My Aunt Louise liked to hunt.

26:10.819 --> 26:14.152
-And I'd go hunting with her a bunch.
-Really?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.817
Would you believe
that Sarah used to be a vegetarian?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.406
Yeah. I know.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.571
Really? She told you that?

26:23.749 --> 26:27.913
I hope you boys are ready
for some true Southern decadence.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.671
You don't really eat Sarah's ribs.
It's more like you take a bath in them.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.717
-Oh, hang on a sec.
-Oh, here, let me.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.424
Well, it's--

26:39.598 --> 26:42.431
-Let's see.
-Thank you.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.512
-Yummy.
-Thank you.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.230
Okay.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.433
-Is that good?
-Yes, it feels good.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.600
All right. So that's nice right there.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.643
That's good.

26:56.115 --> 27:00.950
Steve, I think Jason has the makings
of a true soldier of God.

27:01.578 --> 27:06.117
-l was just thinking the same thing.
-No, I got a long way to go.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.543
Not as long as you might think.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.788
God has chosen you...

27:13.966 --> 27:16.673
-Amen.
-...for his most glorious mission.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.051
Praise his light.

27:19.221 --> 27:24.466
We are forming an elite spiritual army
called the Soldiers of the Sun...

27:24.643 --> 27:27.476
...and Jason, we need you.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.231
God needs you.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.820
What a blessing.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.481
Okay.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.487
All right.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.243
Another Scotch and Coke.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.911
I'll take care of him.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.539
-|t's a slow night.
-Lucky for you.

27:57.593 --> 28:00.380
-I thought you quit drinking.
-I thought I did too.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.764
Well, I don't want your sister
giving me grief if you wreck her car...

28:05.934 --> 28:07.845
...so I'm cutting you off.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.510
Fuck you, Merlotte.

28:10.981 --> 28:14.599
That's the Scotch talking, othenNise,
I might need to say, "Go fuck yourself."

28:15.736 --> 28:18.273
I ain't even got an office anymore.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.778
Bud took my badge.

28:19.948 --> 28:23.281
Well, you'll get it back when you sober up
and you know it. Now go home.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.034
So my tight-ass sister
and even tighter-ass grandmama...

28:26.205 --> 28:29.413
...can look at me like I'm a big loser?
No, thanks.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.789
No more drinks for Andy.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.468
He's the only one in here.

28:40.636 --> 28:43.048
No one else has come in
for over an hour.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.087
-Your point?
-Well, let's close up early.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.428
-I wanna go to Tara's party.
-Tara's having a party?

28:48.602 --> 28:50.467
Yeah. At Sookie's.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.473
For her birthday.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.352
You know that real elegant woman
Tara's friends with?

28:55.525 --> 28:58.392
She's throwing it, and I heard she knows
how to throw a party.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.108
She sure does, I can tell you that.
Fantastic food.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.740
And I need to ask Tara about a pig.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.775
-So can we go?
-Go where?

29:06.954 --> 29:10.117
-Home.
-Party at the old Stackhouse place.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.953
Party? Well, you can count me in.
I've been working hard enough for one day.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.999
You going?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.674
I don't think so.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.000
Well, I hope you change your mind.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.515
Hey, Miss Thornton.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.644
-Tara here?
-No, she's off today.

29:37.025 --> 29:40.643
Y'all go ahead. Go ahead, I'll close up.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.781
How is she?

29:46.952 --> 29:49.614
She's okay. As far as I can tell.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.956
Y'all ain't together no more?

29:53.959 --> 29:55.574
No, ma'am.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.369
Good night, Arlene.

30:01.717 --> 30:06.302
Today's Tara's birthday.
Twenty-six years old.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.219
Would you give this to her?

30:08.557 --> 30:11.014
I don't know who else to ask.

30:14.396 --> 30:15.476
Of course.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.729
Thank you.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.319
Anubis Airlines welcomes you to Dallas...

30:28.493 --> 30:33.613
...the most vampire-friendly destination
in the great state of Texas.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.626
That's me.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.968
I've always loved these.
They're like booze for dolls.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.173
They gave me 10.

30:49.431 --> 30:52.093
You're two hours late.
Supposed to be here before sundown.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.098
We got delayed for takeoff.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.681
Why don't you go in the limo.
I got the ac. cranked.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.436
No, thanks. I'm fine.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.349
Oh, go on. There's Cokes in there.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.366
just get in the goddamn limo,
you stupid bitch.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.533
Get your hands off me!

31:11.870 --> 31:14.828
Make a noise and it'll be your last.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.120
Hey, how the hell does this thing open?

31:20.128 --> 31:22.790
Somebody help get me out of here. Help!

31:33.016 --> 31:34.927
Whose party is it?
You got any idea?

31:35.102 --> 31:37.309
Somebody said that black girl
who works at Merlotte's.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.811
Oh, yeah,
I know who you're talking about.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.777
A present? For me?

31:54.955 --> 31:56.286
I love presents.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.072
It's for Tara, from her mom.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.617
Gift table's in the dining room.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.352
Well, I have to say,
I'm impressed by your showing up.

32:22.149 --> 32:25.892
Okay, listen. Go ahead and turn me...

32:26.069 --> 32:29.527
...but you'll also reveal yourself
in the process.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.438
Reveal myself as what?

32:32.534 --> 32:34.616
As whatever the hell you are.

32:36.872 --> 32:40.535
I don't know what you're doing here,
but these are people I care about...

32:40.709 --> 32:44.167
...and I will not stand by
if you try and hurt any of them.

32:44.337 --> 32:48.501
Even when they've dumped you
or chosen a dead man over you?

32:50.635 --> 32:53.297
You're really not an alpha, are you?

33:12.574 --> 33:14.064
Who are all these people?

33:14.242 --> 33:17.279
-I don't see any other people.
-Because you only got eyes for me.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.446
Yeah, you don't like that
one bit, do you?

33:20.916 --> 33:22.907
Seriously, who are all these people?

33:23.084 --> 33:26.212
And why are they bringing me presents?
Not that I'm complaining.

33:26.630 --> 33:30.248
-I like the way you move.
-I love to dance.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.416
I can't even remember the last time I did.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.925
See, that's just wrong.

33:34.095 --> 33:37.804
Anybody that dances like you
should dance every fucking day.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.683
Back it up. Come on. Yeah.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.269
-I like that.
-Come here.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.684
Hey.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.840
You need to refill that glass.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.976
-Tell me your name.
-Leon.

34:33.154 --> 34:37.318
All right, Leon,
no one is gonna hurt you.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.662
-Would you like to try?
-Could I?

34:45.542 --> 34:46.782
Here.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.497
Lean in close so you can catch his gaze.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.421
Then just let everything go.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.087
Let yourself be dead.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.962
You feel it?

35:02.267 --> 35:06.351
You are empty, a vacuum.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.974
Now you can pull his mind into yours.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.853
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.443
There's nothing to fear.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.535
Don't you worry about a thing.
It's gonna be all right.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.324
You were very sweet with her.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.879
-Sookie, he was sent to abduct you.
-You'll be just fine.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.382
Which means somebody knew
you were coming.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.884
Who do you think's behind it? Vampires?

35:40.055 --> 35:42.797
-Too sloppy.
-Just look into my eyes.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.350
Maybe that church.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.429
Bill, they may be crazy,
but they're still a church.

35:47.604 --> 35:50.061
They're not gonna kidnap anybody.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.017
SooMe”.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.312
...churches have done much, much worse
throughout history.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.979
--to do is trust me.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.399
-Give me a better hand than this.
-Lucky you're not playing for money.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.283
What's the dork face about?

36:04.454 --> 36:06.536
Oh, I'm moving out.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.697
I'm gonna be a Soldier of the Sun.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.207
Really?

36:16.049 --> 36:17.914
Yep. You heard of it?

36:18.093 --> 36:20.425
Of course I've heard of it.
It's why I came here.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.758
-I guess you feel pretty special.
-Nothing wrong with feeling good...

36:24.140 --> 36:26.472
...when you achieve something.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.012
I guess you wouldn't know.

36:30.522 --> 36:34.856
So you think you were the only one
they would choose to promote?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.607
The only one in this whole camp?

36:36.778 --> 36:39.611
Hey, it is what it is.

36:39.781 --> 36:43.615
It's 14 other guys, is what it is.
Including me.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.868
Yeah, even four girls.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.280
That's great. Congratulations.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.198
You gonna bunk at the Newlins' too?

36:52.377 --> 36:53.867
No.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.960
I get it.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.256
Preacher's wife needs something
to play with.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.805
-What?
-She wants your hot beef injection, dude.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.593
-I can't believe I didn't see it sooner.
-That ain't true.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.887
And you shouldn't talk about Sarah
that way.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.771
Sarah?

37:17.318 --> 37:19.058
You work fast.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.944
I ain't working. She's married.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.652
Go for it. She's hot.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.496
She ain't like that.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.453
I earned this.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.789
I'm sure you did.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.464
Fuck you.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.508
I have you down for a room with no bed?

37:48.892 --> 37:50.848
Eric.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.761
No, we need a bed.

37:53.938 --> 37:58.853
Of course. I do have a Iight-blockable room
with a king-size bed.

37:59.027 --> 38:02.064
It's a suite. Double-soundproofed.

38:02.238 --> 38:05.401
Oh, with an adjoining room for my--

38:05.575 --> 38:08.817
-What should I call her?
-Isn't there a vampire word?

38:08.995 --> 38:12.032
-Progeny.
-Cal| her your ward.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.495
You have a ward, like Bruce Wayne.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.456
Would you give me your cell phone?

38:21.883 --> 38:22.998
Thank you, Leon.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.001
-Everything's okay.
-Yes.

38:26.179 --> 38:29.546
Actually, everything's not okay.

38:30.391 --> 38:34.225
All your worst fears
are about to come true.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.430
No.

38:35.605 --> 38:40.474
Unless you scream
at the top of your lungs:

38:42.362 --> 38:45.069
These accommodations are covered
by a third party, right?

38:45.240 --> 38:48.107
Yes, sir. It's all been taken care of
by a Mr. Northman.

38:48.284 --> 38:52.823
Becky Eubanks is a stuck-up whore
who let Jayce finger her in the church!

38:52.997 --> 38:54.248
Jessica!

38:58.294 --> 39:00.205
She's new.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.006
Good evening, Lafayette.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.591
No.

40:35.308 --> 40:39.426
You can't come in my house unless I invite
you, and I ain't nowhere near that crazy.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.640
You have to come out eventually.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.606
-I have all the time in the world.
-You let me go.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.859
I gave you a very generous gift.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.486
The gift of not killing you.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.486
And I'm here to give you something else.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.492
The healing elixir that is
my IOOO-year-old blood.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.214
I don't think that's a good idea.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.627
Your Ieg's already infected. I can smell it.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.717
You don't get that taken care of,
you can lose it.

41:18.101 --> 41:19.887
Why do you want to give me your blood?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.980
-I like you.
-Bullshit.

41:26.359 --> 41:29.226
You wanna be able to keep track of me.
Why?

41:29.404 --> 41:31.941
You obviously mean something
to Sookie...

41:32.115 --> 41:36.825
...and what Sookie finds meaningful,
I find curious.

41:38.955 --> 41:41.947
You really have no choice, Lafayette.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.453
You know it.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.538
Fuck.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.254
Leon, look at me.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.594
Look at me, Leon.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.773
Everything is going to be okay.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.267
No, it's not.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.069
My worst nightmare is--

42:14.240 --> 42:16.322
Jessica, what on earth did you do
to this man?

42:16.492 --> 42:19.484
I am on the phone.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.778
Maybe if you put your hand
on his shoulder?

42:21.956 --> 42:24.618
Sometimes touching helps me
hear their thoughts better.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.169
-Who sent you?
-Fellowship of the Sun.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.089
-Are you a member?
-No, they hired me.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.797
-Who specifically?
-I'm not sure. It was over the phone.

42:37.972 --> 42:40.554
Money was put in a locker for me
at a Greyhound station.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.723
And they hired you to do what, exactly?

42:42.894 --> 42:46.762
Abduct a human with the Compton party,
bring her to the church.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.145
Do you know my name?

42:48.316 --> 42:51.558
No, ma'am. I didn't even know
you were gonna be a woman.

42:51.986 --> 42:56.150
All I know is the vampire's are using
a human to find the vampire Godric.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.814
Do you know where he is?

42:58.326 --> 43:00.112
No, ma'am, I do not.

43:07.335 --> 43:08.950
You did very well.

43:09.796 --> 43:13.038
I'm sure your employers will be pleased.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.501
Think so?

43:14.675 --> 43:16.802
Of course. What could you do?

43:16.969 --> 43:19.802
We never arrived. It's not your fault.

43:19.972 --> 43:23.180
Yeah. Flight never arrived.

43:23.351 --> 43:26.013
No. We just weren't on it.

43:27.021 --> 43:29.763
I got so nervous for nothing.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.974
You called for Barani?

43:33.152 --> 43:35.564
You must prepare my cabin
for a feast of celebration.

43:35.738 --> 43:39.822
I already have, captain. / already have.
See for yourself.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.198
That's enough.

43:43.371 --> 43:45.077
Don't get greedy.

43:48.918 --> 43:50.954
You were to call me
the minute you arrived.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.710
We were ambushed at the airport.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.132
-By whom?
-You know exactly by whom, Eric.

43:55.299 --> 43:58.211
Fellowship of the Sun.
Why didn't you tell me they were involved?

43:58.386 --> 44:01.002
I didn't know for sure. Now I do.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.512
You could have shared
your suspicions with me.

44:04.517 --> 44:06.758
I could have, but I didn't.

44:06.936 --> 44:09.222
You should remember
that I am your sheriff, Bill.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.728
We are not equal.

44:10.898 --> 44:15.232
And if that displeases you,
take it up with the magister or the queen.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.657
Get that shit.
Let it go. Get that shit.

44:26.831 --> 44:29.573
Fuck, get up. Up, up!

44:29.750 --> 44:31.331
How's your leg?

44:31.502 --> 44:33.914
Shit, I just wanna fucking dance.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.544
-Hit this.
-How nice for you.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.876
Come on, come on, come on.

44:38.050 --> 44:39.085
Well, I must fly.

44:39.260 --> 44:42.923
Bang it, baby. Bang it, baby.
Bang it, baby.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.611
You getting situated okay?

44:58.613 --> 45:01.320
Yes. Thank you, ma'am.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.568
Sure was fun today.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.904
Yeah, it was.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.117
Jason?

45:14.295 --> 45:17.207
-Are you nervous?
-No.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.874
A little.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.714
Why?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.174
Well, it's just that...

45:28.517 --> 45:33.637
...I ain't never been in a place
this nice before.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.522
It's all too much.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.899
Aren't you sweet.

45:43.366 --> 45:45.823
I am so proud of you.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.824
You're welcome.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.537
So proud.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.663
Can I ask you a question?

45:56.879 --> 46:00.087
Am I the only one staying here
in your house?

46:02.551 --> 46:07.762
We have a special dorm for the soldiers,
but it only sleeps 14.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.344
And you're number 15.

46:12.853 --> 46:16.141
Oh, good. Good.

46:17.066 --> 46:18.647
And you're also the best.

46:20.528 --> 46:25.363
I mean, the one that we have
the highest hopes for.

46:28.577 --> 46:31.660
I want to try not to disappoint you.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.572
-You do that.
-Okay.

46:34.750 --> 46:38.663
And let me know if you need anything...

46:39.088 --> 46:41.170
...because we're just at the end
of the hall.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.752
Big double doors.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.562
It's Eric. You wanted to talk.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.862
This is important.

47:08.951 --> 47:11.067
Meet me in the bar.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.578
Fudge.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.166
I admire you, Bill.

47:23.341 --> 47:27.129
It takes a real vampire to admit
he cannot protect his human.

47:27.303 --> 47:30.591
And it takes a true monster
to not care about anyone or anything...

47:30.765 --> 47:33.598
-...other than himself.
-I care about others.

47:33.768 --> 47:36.100
You care about Godric.

47:37.063 --> 47:39.725
You have no obligations
to Dallas or Texas.

47:39.899 --> 47:42.561
This is personal for you. Why?

47:44.403 --> 47:48.692
I hope you'll enjoy your blood substitute,
which is costing me $45.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.733
I have no intention of drinking it.
I want you to pay for it.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.276
Oh, you're so mature.

47:53.454 --> 47:55.615
Answer the question.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.451
Why this allegiance to Godric?

48:00.294 --> 48:02.455
He's much beloved by his subjects.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.290
Only kings and queens have subjects, Eric,
not sheriffs.

48:07.468 --> 48:10.301
Godric could have been king of Texas
had he wanted.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.213
He could have been king
of any vampire territory anywhere.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.720
He is twice as old as I am
and very powerful.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.469
There are none above him
in the New World.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.772
Well, if he's so powerful,
how could they abduct him?

48:24.151 --> 48:26.642
Now, that is what worries me.

48:27.029 --> 48:30.613
If one such as he
can be taken by humans...

48:30.866 --> 48:33.243
...then none of us is safe.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.246
What can I give you to release Sookie
from her agreement?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.748
Nothing.

48:43.170 --> 48:47.004
And since you like humans so much,
I think you would want to protect them.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.003
The vampires here, they're like cowboys.

48:50.511 --> 48:53.969
If they don't get Godric back,
they'll want justice.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.099
They'll start attacking people.

48:56.267 --> 48:58.599
Open aggression against humans?
That's insane.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.018
Well, it's Texas.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.819
That's nice.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.738
Here.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.733
Damn.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.694
I've been wanting to do that
since you showed up tonight.

49:56.076 --> 50:00.911
I'm wondering if this is a good idea.

50:01.081 --> 50:03.037
It's a great idea.

50:03.209 --> 50:05.825
You're sweet as hell...

50:06.003 --> 50:08.995
...and adorable and scruffy
with that little gray in your hair...

50:09.173 --> 50:12.586
...and that hot little nose.

50:13.594 --> 50:17.587
And, damn, boy, do you know
how to wear a pair of pants.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.261
Hey, hey, hey.

50:26.273 --> 50:27.934
What's wrong?

50:28.108 --> 50:29.848
Listen...

50:31.153 --> 50:33.565
...I need to tell you something.

50:34.657 --> 50:37.444
-No, you don't.
-Yes. Yes, I do.

50:37.618 --> 50:40.485
No, you don't.

50:42.957 --> 50:45.039
I know what you are.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.432
Who is it?

53:17.986 --> 53:20.443
I ordered something. Is that okay?

53:21.949 --> 53:24.190
Male, straight, B-negative.

53:25.869 --> 53:27.450
Hi, I'm Travis.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.123
That's for me.

53:33.711 --> 53:37.078
Great, What am I supposed to do?
I know Bill doesn't want her to do this.

53:37.256 --> 53:40.293
How old is he anyway?
He looks barely legal.

53:40.467 --> 53:41.627
He's 21.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.463
That’s weird.
Almost like he read my mind.

53:43.637 --> 53:46.174
I did read your mind. Oh, fuck, Barry.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.304
just smile and act
like it’s a coincidence.

53:48.475 --> 53:49.806
Keep your stupid mouth shut.

53:49.977 --> 53:53.140
But it's not a coincidence, Barry.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.734
Barry, wait.
