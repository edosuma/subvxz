00:02.003 --> 00:03.834
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.921 --> 00:05.331
I don't know how it happened,

00:05.423 --> 00:09.757
but you seem to have some
communion with this island, John.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.335
And that makes you very, very important.

00:12.430 --> 00:15.422
In time, you'll have a better
understanding of things.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.509
Kwon is pregnant.

00:19.604 --> 00:22.516
- The fetus is healthy...
- What's that?

00:22.607 --> 00:25.349
Juliet is gathering information
for us at your camp.

00:25.443 --> 00:31.359
She's determining if any women are
pregnant. Then we're going to take them.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.907
Juliet is a mole.
She's working for Ben.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.612
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

00:39.707 --> 00:43.871
We are not going anywhere, John.
You are going to stay behind.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.792
We'll leave a trail, one you can track.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.964
And John, unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

00:51.052 --> 00:52.542
don't bother.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.638
[screams]

00:58.601 --> 01:00.341
Come on, damn it, push!

01:04.398 --> 01:06.480
Something's wrong. I can't...

01:08.486 --> 01:12.729
Emily, you can do this! Now, push!

01:12.823 --> 01:15.030
Come on, come on, baby.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.732
You can do it, now, come on.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.864
Come on, there you go. Come on.

01:26.003 --> 01:30.667
It's a boy. You did it.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.794
It hurts.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.474
Oh. You did it.

01:44.689 --> 01:46.896
Oh, my God. Roger, it hurts.

01:46.983 --> 01:48.098
Emily...

01:51.821 --> 01:56.531
Emily. No one knows we're out here.
We gotta get back, OK, honey?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.903
Can you hold on to the baby?

01:58.995 --> 02:02.579
Emily! Can you hold the baby?
Hold him tight.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.493
[panting]

02:12.883 --> 02:15.465
[horn blowing]

02:15.553 --> 02:17.214
Hey! Help!

02:18.347 --> 02:19.302
Help.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.880
Help!

02:21.726 --> 02:22.761
Help!

02:26.272 --> 02:28.103
Help me...

02:28.190 --> 02:30.476
Hey, what happened, man?

02:30.568 --> 02:35.312
We were hiking. She went into labor.
She wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.489
We'll put her in the car, OK?
We'll get you to the hospital.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.612
- OK, OK, honey...
- [groans]

02:40.703 --> 02:43.991
OK, it's all right,
let's keep her warm, all right?

02:44.081 --> 02:46.333
- How's the baby?
- Fine, I guess. I don't know.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.667
Roger. . . Roger. ..

02:49.754 --> 02:52.621
- I'm right here...
- Call him Benjamin.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.043
Stay with me...

02:57.553 --> 03:00.420
Stay with me. Emily!

03:03.601 --> 03:06.559
Emily! Oh, God, no!

03:14.278 --> 03:15.859
What ya got there?

03:15.946 --> 03:20.610
It's a birthday present.
Mine just happens to be today.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.868
You do remember birthdays,
don't you, Richard?

03:25.581 --> 03:28.163
So, do you want me to bring
the tape back to Juliet?

03:29.043 --> 03:30.032
What?

03:30.127 --> 03:34.120
The tape with instructions for Juliet.
Do you want it at the Medical Station?

03:34.215 --> 03:37.548
I recorded it yesterday, before we left.
I thought you took it.

03:37.635 --> 03:41.548
- No.
- Where's Tom?

03:41.639 --> 03:47.009
Tom? Have you seen my recorder?

04:11.669 --> 04:16.003
You said that if I killed my father,

04:16.090 --> 04:19.878
you'd tell me everything
I wanted to know about the island.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.972
So, why don't you
start at the beginning?

04:49.039 --> 04:51.576
I know I promised to tell you
everything, John,

04:51.667 --> 04:57.037
and | wish it was as simple as me taking
out a dusty old book and opening it up.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.964
But it's not that simple.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.311
How about you just tell me.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.143
You probably think I'm the leader
of this little community.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.691
But that's not entirely true.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.985
We all answer to someone, John.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.733
And who might that be?

05:25.534 --> 05:27.570
His name is Jacob.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.824
OK, then, take me to Jacob.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.280
I can't do that.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.624
Where are you going?

05:35.711 --> 05:38.453
If you don't want to take me,
maybe someone else will.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.503
I'll just go and ask Richard.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.924
Why would Richard take you?
He doesn't talk to Jacob.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.672
- Well, who talks to him?
- I do.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.674
- You're the only one?
- That's right.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.676
And no one else knows where he is?

05:49.767 --> 05:52.509
l was born here on this island.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.844
I'm one of the last that was.

05:54.939 --> 05:59.524
Most of these people you see, I brought
them here. So, Jacob talks to me, John.

05:59.944 --> 06:03.436
He tells me what to do, trusts me.

06:03.531 --> 06:07.695
And no one else has ever seen him.

06:07.785 --> 06:11.073
- That's right.
- How convenient.

06:11.372 --> 06:15.991
You know what I think, Ben?
I think there is no Jacob.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.292
I think your people
are idiots if they believe

06:18.379 --> 06:20.370
you take orders from someone else.

06:20.464 --> 06:26.334
You are the man behind the curtain,
the Wizard of Oz.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.712
And you're a liar.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.886
And what might you base
that theory on, John?

06:33.978 --> 06:39.439
Because if you were telling the truth,
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.509
Namaste.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.184
- Thanks.
- Namaste.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.026
Hey, welcome to the island, man.
Namaste.

07:26.113 --> 07:30.106
- Namaste, yeah.
- So, what do ya think?

07:30.200 --> 07:34.569
Well, this is some place. Thanks again
for the opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.039
- Horace, please.
- Horace.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.739
- And this must be Ben.
- Yeah.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.075
Mr. Goodspeed was there
the day you were born.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.456
Yes, l was.

07:43.547 --> 07:47.005
He's doing us a big favor here,
gave your old man a job.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.462
He don't say much.

07:49.553 --> 07:54.263
That's OK. I bet he will when
he has something to say. Right, Ben?

07:54.725 --> 07:58.468
Hey, you hungry, kiddo?

07:58.562 --> 08:02.646
Great. Tell you what, after you're
done processing, we'll have some lunch.

08:02.733 --> 08:03.722
How's that sound?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.479
- Yeah, thanks you.
- You're gonna love it here.

08:08.030 --> 08:11.522
Welcome to the island.
For your own comfort and safety,

08:11.617 --> 08:14.825
we ask that you stay within the conﬁnes
of your new quarters.

08:14.912 --> 08:19.121
Our barracks are surrounded by
a high frequency sonar fence

08:19.208 --> 08:23.326
to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.832
You are now a member
of the Dharma Initiative.

08:25.923 --> 08:29.211
What kind of wildlife you think
this fence is protecting us from?

08:29.301 --> 08:32.668
- Roger Linus? Roger Linus?
- Yeah.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.879
Every morning, you will be given
a new code,

08:34.973 --> 08:37.555
which will allow you to cross
outside the fence.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.932
There are properties on this island
that exist nowhere else on Earth.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.810
Our mission is to study these properties

08:45.901 --> 08:50.520
for the betterment of mankind and
advancement of world peace.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.566
Should you be assigned
to zoological studies...

08:55.661 --> 08:59.324
[Annie] Hey. You're new, huh?

09:01.500 --> 09:02.580
l'm Annie.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.713
Want one?

09:09.299 --> 09:12.041
We can have as many as we want.

09:12.344 --> 09:18.214
"Work Man"?
What is this? "Work Man"?

09:18.308 --> 09:19.297
ROGER
WORK MAN

09:19.393 --> 09:21.429
- I'm a janitor?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.183
Goodspeed told me you people were
doing experiments, changing the world.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.889
I didn't come here to clean up.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.067
If anything else opens up,
you can feel free to apply for it.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.575
Come on.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.612
[Hurley] Dude, you know, this can't
be worse than haggis.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.497
Hey. Sayid.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.833
- What happened to you?
- l was with Locke.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.212
- Well, where is he?
- He went back.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.262
Back where?

09:59.349 --> 10:02.933
With them. Don't ask me where the hell
it is 'cause it don't matter.

10:03.020 --> 10:07.013
What does matter, is this.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.522
[panting]

10:17.034 --> 10:20.401
Where is Ben? Where is he?

10:25.167 --> 10:27.203
I thought you were dead.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.704
l'm fortunate the pylons
were not set to a lethal level.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.969
- What is he doing here?
- It's all right.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.968
He's the one who tried to kill me.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.139
He's with us now.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.720
Where have you been, Mikhail?

10:47.815 --> 10:50.852
I encountered several
of his people in the jungle.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.059
They had an injured woman with them.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.735
Apparently, she just
parachuted onto the island.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.485
- What?
- Her helo crashed in the water.

10:58.575 --> 11:03.410
She says her ship is approximately
130 klicks to the west of us.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.284
- She has a radio-telephone.
- Where is she now?

11:06.375 --> 11:09.492
I assume they have taken her
back to their camp.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.999
We'll be visiting their camp day
after tomorrow. We'll take care of it.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.331
Day after tomorrow?
We have to go now.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.416
Ben's not going anywhere with you.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.720
- Excuse me?
- He and l are going to see Jacob.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.771
Please tell me
this isn't true, Benjamin.

11:37.281 --> 11:41.490
I'm sorry, I have to deal with this now,
John. Our excursion will have to wait.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.825
Since when do you explain
yourself to him, an outsider?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.865
[grunts and groans]

11:49.960 --> 11:51.666
Tom!

11:52.421 --> 11:53.786
Richard!

12:05.726 --> 12:08.718
So when do we leave?

12:12.983 --> 12:16.771
You know, you didn't have to beat
Mikhail senseless to make your point.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.857
Yes, I did.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.439
[Alex] Locke...

12:25.913 --> 12:27.494
I hear you're gonna go see Jacob.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.699
You're gonna need this.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.830
Thanks.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.306
Happy birthday, Dad.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.475
[cocks gun]

13:01.865 --> 13:05.107
[Olivia] So once water is
added to the bicarbonate,

13:05.202 --> 13:08.660
we will get our very own
volcanic reaction.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.570
Yes?

13:10.666 --> 13:13.248
Is that what happened to
the volcano on this island?

13:13.335 --> 13:17.248
Exactly, Annie, but that
was a long time ago.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.455
OK, let's get ourselves an eruption.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.959
Oh, cool.

13:21.051 --> 13:26.136
Just add water and, voila.
Now, I know it's not lava, but...

13:27.432 --> 13:29.138
What was that?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.306
- [boom]
- [alarm sounds]

13:33.397 --> 13:35.558
OK, everyone into your positions.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.690
That's right, all together.
Annie, lock the back door, please.

13:42.781 --> 13:43.896
[chatteringing]

13:45.701 --> 13:48.238
[Olivia] Ben, come on,
honey, you've gotta move.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.236
Ben!

13:51.248 --> 13:52.488
[screaming]

13:54.543 --> 13:56.124
Come on.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.090
Don't worry, it's just the hostiles.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.009
We'll be OK.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.712
[crying]

14:08.807 --> 14:09.887
[man] Get down!

14:09.975 --> 14:12.842
[gunshots]

14:13.145 --> 14:15.511
[Horace] Heard you ran
into a little trouble.

14:15.605 --> 14:19.848
[Roger] We're driving back from the
Flame and we hear this huge explosion.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.525
Next thing I know,
there's a siren wailing

14:22.612 --> 14:24.523
and we're driving through a shoot-out.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.196
We're having some
skirmishes with the natives.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.868
- [Roger] What do you mean, "natives"?
- [Horace] We're not sure who they are.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.195
Well, this ain't what I signed up for.

14:33.290 --> 14:37.624
[Horace] Roger, I did you a favor, man.
You were having trouble finding work.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.544
Don't forget about Ben.
He's getting a quality education.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.621
I don't give a damn about his education.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.550
If I'm gonna get shot at, I want
hazard pay! I want another 30 grand.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.671
[Horace] Calm down.

14:47.763 --> 14:51.381
- [Roger] Don't say you don't have it.
- [tapping]

14:52.893 --> 14:54.508
Get the hell out of my house!

14:57.230 --> 14:58.606
[gasps]

15:05.822 --> 15:07.687
I thought I told you to go to bed.

15:35.519 --> 15:38.761
- She's not here.
- I noticed.

15:39.231 --> 15:42.940
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Juliet.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.768
You're not gonna find her in there.
She left with Jack.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.193
Juliet left with Jack?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.612
He took off right after
I told him about Naomi.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.280
Who's Naomi?

15:51.368 --> 15:53.108
And why would you do that, Kate?

15:53.203 --> 15:55.364
Because she's hurt,
because he's a doctor,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.241
and because he has a right to know.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.907
- Where is he now?
- I don't know, Sayid.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.866
Of course you don't.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.874
It might be time for you to
tell everybody else about Naomi.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.171
Play her the tape.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.670
What tape?

16:15.058 --> 16:18.471
Something you should know, John,
before we go...

16:19.896 --> 16:22.308
...whether or not you think
he's the Wizard of Oz,

16:22.399 --> 16:25.857
I can assure you that
Jacob is very, very real.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.405
And we're going to go see him,
and he's not going to like it.

16:33.243 --> 16:38.783
In fact, I have a feeling
he's going to be very angry.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.953
That's why my hand was shaking because
this is not a man you go and see.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.708
This is a man who summons you.

17:33.970 --> 17:38.054
lt's us. That's you, and that's me.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.302
Now we never have to be
away from each other.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.142
Happy birthday, Ben.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.696
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.274
[inhales and groans]

18:40.870 --> 18:42.906
It's your birthday.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.700
Sorry I forgot.

18:51.756 --> 18:55.374
Kinda hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.086
She was just seven months pregnant.
We went for a hike.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.799
But you had to come early...

19:04.769 --> 19:08.637
Now she's gone,

19:08.732 --> 19:12.475
and I'm stuck here
on this island... with you.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.612
[groans]

19:24.164 --> 19:26.780
Happy birthday, Ben.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.002
[crying]

19:32.088 --> 19:33.919
[panting]

19:47.062 --> 19:49.348
[faint whisper]

19:51.733 --> 19:53.098
Mom?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.155
Ben, don't!

20:04.871 --> 20:09.240
- Mom.
- It's not time yet, Benjamin.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.664
Mom!

20:21.221 --> 20:22.210
Mom.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.291
[Ben] Let's go, John.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.505
John.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.185
So, what, the whole world
thinks we're dead?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.263
- That's not important.
- Not important?

21:14.357 --> 21:17.440
- What do you mean, not important?
- [Naomi] Excuse me...

21:18.111 --> 21:20.568
I'm sorry, don't you people
want to be rescued?

21:20.655 --> 21:22.646
We kept her a secret to keep her safe.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.196
Safe from what, Sayid?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.399
Safe from Jack.

21:26.536 --> 21:30.620
He spent a week with the Others, and
he brought one of them back with him.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.164
Here, amongst us.

21:33.251 --> 21:36.118
And every time we try to get answers
from this woman,

21:36.212 --> 21:37.918
he prevents her from giving them.

21:38.006 --> 21:42.875
But, it's Jack.
He would never do anything to hurt us.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.132
And Juliet,
I believe she is a good person.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.214
Good person, huh?
And you're basing that on what?

21:49.309 --> 21:53.598
It wouldn't involve her taking you to
one of their medical stations, would it?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.855
- How...
- [Juliet] Kwon is pregnant.

21:57.942 --> 22:01.685
The fetus is healthy and was
conceived on island with her husband.

22:01.779 --> 22:04.486
He was sterile before they got here.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.486
I’m working on getting samples
from the other women.

22:07.577 --> 22:10.489
I should have Austen's soon.
I’ll report when I know more.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.821
Where'd you get that?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.790
- Where have you been, Jack?
- | asked you where you got it.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.085
You're in a position
to ask us questions?

22:19.172 --> 22:21.003
- Turn the tape over.
- Stay out of it!

22:21.090 --> 22:23.672
You want to burn me at the stake?
Here I am. But first,

22:23.760 --> 22:25.921
turn the tape over, press play.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.311
[Ben] Juliet, it’s Ben.

22:37.398 --> 22:41.437
I’m sending three teams to extract
Kwon the night after tomorrow.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.610
We won’t have time
to run Austen's sample,

22:43.696 --> 22:46.529
so if you determine that she
or anyone else is pregnant,

22:46.616 --> 22:51.201
mark their tents and
we’ll take them too.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.948
Good luck.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.248
The night I saw your baby
on the ultrasound,

23:01.339 --> 23:03.671
I told Jack what they were making me do.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.508
Why didn't you tell us?

23:08.388 --> 23:11.221
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.638
Yet?

23:20.149 --> 23:23.312
I think we've got some
catching up to do.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.994
[beeps]

23:48.344 --> 23:50.460
[electrical humming decreases]

24:39.145 --> 24:40.510
Mom?

24:47.487 --> 24:49.023
Mom?

24:50.948 --> 24:51.937
Mom!

24:52.825 --> 24:54.281
Mom!

24:54.661 --> 24:56.572
Mom!

25:02.043 --> 25:05.627
[faint whispering]

25:15.765 --> 25:19.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, hey, hey.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.306
I didn't mean to scare you...
Wait. Are you lost? Wait.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.599
Are you one of them?

25:28.528 --> 25:31.395
- One of who?
- A hostile.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.317
Do you even know what that word means?

25:37.412 --> 25:38.367
What's your name?

25:38.454 --> 25:40.536
- Ben.
- Ben?

25:40.623 --> 25:43.956
You wanna tell me what you're doing
in the jungle all by yourself?

25:46.546 --> 25:50.960
I left home, and...
I'm looking for my mom.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.759
- You think she's out here?
- You wouldn't believe me.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.847
Try me.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.427
She's dead.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.724
Did she die here? On the island?

26:08.818 --> 26:12.561
No. When I was a baby.

26:13.656 --> 26:17.740
Did you see her... out here, Ben?
In the jungle?

26:19.620 --> 26:20.996
She talked to me.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.076
What'd she say?

26:25.168 --> 26:26.783
That I couldn't come with her.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.753
She said it wasn't time yet.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.763
You should go home now.
Your people will be looking for you.

26:44.312 --> 26:46.177
I hate it there.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.104
Take me with you.

26:54.489 --> 26:58.778
Maybe that can happen. Maybe.

26:58.868 --> 27:03.202
If that's what you really want, Ben,
I want you to think about that.

27:05.500 --> 27:10.369
And you're going
to have to be very, very patient.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.853
We're here.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.619
You'll want to turn off
your flashlight, John.

27:48.709 --> 27:49.835
VVhy?

27:53.172 --> 27:56.539
Jacob feels the same way
about technology as you do.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.583
Once I open this door,
there's no turning back.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.963
Are you sure this is what you want?

28:50.271 --> 28:51.852
So be it.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.225
Jacob?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.185
I'm here with John Locke.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.574
We're coming in now.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.429
Jacob...

29:28.643 --> 29:30.179
This is John.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.603
Aren't you going to say hello, John?

29:37.193 --> 29:41.687
- What?
- I told you he wouldn't.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.363
Who... What are you talking about?

29:45.534 --> 29:47.525
You can't see him?

29:47.620 --> 29:50.453
- See who?
- Jacob.

29:52.375 --> 29:55.082
He's sitting right here...
in this chair.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.285
Yes, I know, but he insisted.

29:59.799 --> 30:03.963
- What is this?
- You wanted the secrets of the island.

30:04.053 --> 30:08.547
Well, here they are. This is the man
who can answer every single...

30:10.393 --> 30:15.558
I am not. He made me bring him here.
Did you think that that was my...

30:15.648 --> 30:17.639
- Sorry... May I finish?
- You're crazy.

30:20.528 --> 30:21.734
Excuse me?

30:23.239 --> 30:27.482
You don't know anything about the
island, do you? You just made it all up.

30:27.576 --> 30:31.194
- Jacob, please, I can't hear him if...
- Stop. Stop it. Shut up!

30:33.874 --> 30:37.583
Are you putting on a show for me?

30:37.670 --> 30:38.830
Or do you...

30:40.715 --> 30:42.922
Do you really think
there's someone there?

30:43.926 --> 30:46.338
I know there's someone there.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.098
You don't know anything.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.686
I'm sorry you feel that way, John.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.991
And I'm sorry that you're
too limited to see.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.863
You're pathetic.

31:15.916 --> 31:19.124
[Jacob] Help me.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.421
What did you just say?

31:29.555 --> 31:32.171
l... I didn't say anything.

31:32.266 --> 31:37.431
Oh, yes, you did. I heard you.
You said...

31:37.521 --> 31:40.809
[banging]

31:40.900 --> 31:41.980

31:45.488 --> 31:47.979

31:57.374 --> 31:59.330
That's enough! You've had your fun!

32:49.718 --> 32:51.049
What was that?

32:56.058 --> 32:58.925
That was Jacob.

33:06.402 --> 33:11.522
What did you hear in there, John?
What did Jacob say to you?

33:13.659 --> 33:18.779
- He didn't say anything to me. You did.
- What are you talking about?

33:18.873 --> 33:21.034
There is no Jacob, Ben.

33:21.125 --> 33:25.334
I'm not gonna be taken in by the
little... show you put on last night.

33:25.421 --> 33:29.585
You're a fraud. And it's time
your people were told the truth.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.755
And this is not the way we came.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.055
I've seen enough.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.761
You know, John, you're not wrong.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.017
Some of the things I've told you...

33:46.108 --> 33:49.475
...some of the things I've told
everybody... are simply not true.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.185
Like what?

33:51.280 --> 33:55.364
Well, for starters,
I wasn't born on this island.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.233
Then where did you come from?

34:53.759 --> 34:55.624
Morning.

34:55.719 --> 35:00.383
OK, wait. Put it right...
right down there.

35:02.351 --> 35:03.761
What's your problem now?

35:04.478 --> 35:07.094
You're usually Chatty Cathy
in the morning.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.554
It's my birthday.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.273
I don't know why I keep
fooling myself into thinking

35:15.364 --> 35:18.447
that one of these years
you're actually going to remember.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.323
Well, I'll tell you what,

35:23.414 --> 35:28.784
all we gotta do this morning
is run this stuff out to Pearl Station.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.870
Why don't we go up to the mesa,
drink some beers?

35:35.718 --> 35:40.929
Have some... I don't know,
father and son time?

35:43.892 --> 35:48.101
- I'd like that.
- OK.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.681
[radio plays rock music]

36:02.286 --> 36:04.277
[Roger] Well...

36:05.497 --> 36:08.034
You sure can't say
it ain't beautiful.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.840
Do you really blame me?

36:22.931 --> 36:24.467
What?

36:26.143 --> 36:29.101
Do you really think
it's my fault that she died?

36:33.275 --> 36:35.857
What do I know?

36:40.115 --> 36:43.778
Why do you keep looking at your watch?
You got a date?

36:44.745 --> 36:45.734
Listen...

36:48.207 --> 36:51.995
...if it makes you feel any better...

36:52.086 --> 36:56.375
...I will do my best
to remember your birthday next year.

36:59.468 --> 37:02.460
I don't think that's gonna happen, Dad.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.713
What do you mean?

37:05.808 --> 37:10.643
You know, I've missed her too.
Maybe as much as you have.

37:10.729 --> 37:14.893
But the difference is,
that for as long as I can remember,

37:14.983 --> 37:17.395
I've had to put up with you.

37:19.488 --> 37:25.233
And doing that required
a tremendous amount of patience.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.325
Goodbye, Dad.

You want us to,um...

40:04.278 --> 40:05.984
No, leave him out there.

40:29.011 --> 40:31.502
[Ben] This is where I came from, John.

40:34.725 --> 40:40.516
These are my people.
The Dharma Initiative.

40:42.232 --> 40:45.349
They came here seeking harmony.

40:47.529 --> 40:51.898
But they couldn't even coexist
with the island's original inhabitants.

40:54.369 --> 40:57.953
When it became clear
that one side had to go.

40:58.040 --> 41:01.783
One side had to be purged.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.755
I did what I had to do.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.750
I was one of the people that was smart
enough to make sure that I didn't end up

41:10.844 --> 41:12.459
in that ditch.

41:12.554 --> 41:16.422
Which makes me considerably
smarter than you, John.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.774
What did Jacob say to you?

41:31.865 --> 41:33.651
Why did you do this?

41:33.742 --> 41:37.234
Because you heard him.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.790
Now, I need to know what he said.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.330
Help me.

41:42.751 --> 41:47.165
John, I'm not going to ask you again.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.712
What did he say to you?

41:51.510 --> 41:55.799
He said, "Help me."

42:06.733 --> 42:10.726
Well, I certainly hope
he helps you, John.
