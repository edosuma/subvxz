[Ollie] It's Earth Day!

00:34.160 --> 00:36.080
It's finally Earth Day!

00:36.239 --> 00:37.239
-It is?
-It is?

00:37.440 --> 00:39.760
[Ollie] Yup, my calendar
just beeped to remind me.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.000
[Both] Wahoo! It's Earth Day!

00:42.160 --> 00:44.000
-Ha-ha, it's your day, Earth!
-It's Earth Day!

00:44.160 --> 00:46.160
-Earth, you are so awesome!
-Wahoo! You go, Earth!

00:46.320 --> 00:48.080
Yeah-ha! Wait...

00:48.239 --> 00:49.519
[Both] What's Earth Day?

00:49.680 --> 00:53.040
It's when you celebrate the earth
by doing extra nice things for it.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.040
[Both] Oh, then...

00:55.199 --> 00:56.120
[Both] Yay!

00:56.279 --> 00:57.960
[Both] It's Earth Day!

00:58.120 --> 01:00.120
-Can I get a what, what?
-I want to give you a hug!

01:00.279 --> 01:01.160
Wahoo!

01:01.320 --> 01:04.000
I'm going to plant a fir tree
because trees clean the air.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.800
And, I'm going to put it here,

01:05.960 --> 01:09.039
next to the one Auntie Char planted
for Earth Day 50 years ago!

01:09.200 --> 01:11.960
-Wow!
-Woah! She planted <i>that</i> ?

01:12.119 --> 01:13.399
She must've been strong!

01:13.560 --> 01:16.840
[Giggles] It was just
a baby fir tree then.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.920
But look at it now!

01:18.080 --> 01:19.119
-Woah.
-Wow!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.800
Can we help you plant a tree, Ollie?

01:20.960 --> 01:22.080
Yeah, yeah!

01:22.240 --> 01:23.160
Well, sure.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.080
If we all help plant it,
then it'll be <i>our</i> tree!

01:26.240 --> 01:28.399
[Gasps] The friends tree!

01:28.560 --> 01:29.600
Let's dig!

01:30.479 --> 01:33.200
[All grunting]

01:33.360 --> 01:35.600
[Sighs] Good job, guys!

01:35.759 --> 01:38.360
Uhh... aren't we missing something?

01:38.520 --> 01:39.800
[Chuckles] Like, a tree?

01:39.960 --> 01:42.479
Right... where do we get the tree, Ollie?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.000
Uh, I don't know.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.399
My Auntie Char brought this one
from a tree nursery in Sweden.

01:47.559 --> 01:50.759
They have lots
of incredible trees in Sweden

01:50.920 --> 01:53.000
and really know how to take care of them.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.600
Brainstorm! Let's go to Sweden.

01:55.759 --> 01:57.920
And get our baby fir tree!

01:58.080 --> 01:59.919
What do you say, huh, Ollie?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.399
It's a long way,
but... it is a special day.

02:03.559 --> 02:04.640
Let's go to Sweden!

02:04.800 --> 02:06.720
[Moon and Stanley] For Earth Day!

02:15.160 --> 02:16.600
Wheee!

02:25.440 --> 02:29.519
[Stewardess] <i>Now arriving in Sweden! Yay!</i>

02:37.040 --> 02:39.000
Here's the tree nursery.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.600
Hm? And here's whatever that is...

02:43.760 --> 02:45.440
[All] Oh! A rabbit!

02:45.600 --> 02:48.600
Hi, I'm Beka. I run the nursery.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.600
Nice shirt. It's just like mine!

02:50.760 --> 02:52.720
Wow! It is! [Chuckles]

02:52.880 --> 02:54.280
Hi, I'm Ollie.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.560
These are my friends, Moon and Stanley.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.720
-Ahh!
-Woah!

03:00.880 --> 03:02.840
Sorry to rush, but I'm on a snack break

03:03.000 --> 03:04.239
and don't have much time!

03:04.400 --> 03:06.320
Anyone want some <i>blabarsbullar</i> ?

03:06.480 --> 03:09.320
Blue... blaa... bullar?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.920
Blar-blar-bullas?

03:11.079 --> 03:13.720
Blah-blahs... Hm, nope! Can't say it.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.720
[Giggles] <i>Blabarsbullar</i> !

03:16.880 --> 03:17.760
Blueberry buns.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.840
[Giggle]

03:19.160 --> 03:21.560
[Beka] You don't have to be able
to say it to eat it!

[Chewing]

03:22.840 --> 03:24.239
[Ollie] Mmm...

03:24.519 --> 03:26.040
Blarblusblullar.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.320
Mmm, it's easier to say
with your mouth full.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.320
[Stanley chomps]

03:31.480 --> 03:33.399
Have I got some on my face?

03:33.560 --> 03:35.720
I feel like I've got something on my face.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.280
[Giggles]

03:39.440 --> 03:41.679
Now, tell me. What can I do for you?

03:41.840 --> 03:45.880
Beka, we need a baby fir tree
to plant in our yard for Earth Day.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.959
Wonderful! I can help you with that.

03:48.119 --> 03:50.200
-Let me just check my calendar.
-[Beep]

03:50.359 --> 03:53.239
Oh! I have some time at 6:20 this evening.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.119
Oh no, that'll be too late!

03:55.280 --> 03:56.560
Earth Day will be over

03:56.720 --> 03:58.560
by the time we get home
and plant our tree!

03:58.720 --> 04:00.079
Uh-oh...

04:00.239 --> 04:02.760
But my whole day is filled
with work in the tree nursery.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.920
-See?
-Woah...

04:05.079 --> 04:08.320
So... organized...

04:08.480 --> 04:09.359
[Beka] Thanks!

04:09.560 --> 04:12.399
This tells me when I need
to plant, water and weed.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.959
As I always say,
if you need to remember to do something...

04:16.120 --> 04:18.039
[Both] Put it in your calendar!

04:18.200 --> 04:21.479
[Both gasp and chuckle]

04:21.640 --> 04:23.920
I'm having a brainstorm.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.640
Beka, what if we help you with your work

04:26.800 --> 04:28.120
so you can get it done faster?

04:28.280 --> 04:30.280
Then, you can help <i>us</i> faster!

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
Well, sure!

04:31.599 --> 04:32.719
Let's give it a try!

04:32.880 --> 04:34.400
Uh, let's see...

04:34.560 --> 04:37.240
This row of little trees
needs watering and weeding.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.599
I'll help water.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.400
Stanley, you can help with weed control.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.960
Already on it!

04:43.120 --> 04:45.400
[Chomps] Mm-hm, weeds!

04:45.560 --> 04:48.919
Great! Then I could dig some holes
to plant new trees.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.320
I'll help you with that.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.760
[Both] Safety helmet?

04:52.919 --> 04:55.280
[Laugh]

04:55.440 --> 04:58.360

04:58.520 --> 05:01.680
-[Ollie] Again!
-[Beka] I know, right?

05:01.840 --> 05:04.240
You know, I could help you
with the digging.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.760
I like helmets.

05:05.919 --> 05:07.479
That's OK, Moon.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.320
Beka has it all
so <i>beautifully</i> organized.

05:10.479 --> 05:12.560
Let's just stick to her plan.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.240
OK...

05:14.400 --> 05:17.200
We'll just make our own team.
Right, Stanley?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.320
Nom-nom-nom-nom...

05:19.479 --> 05:22.400
You got it, Moon! Nom-nom-nom-nom...

Oh! Time to move to the next row.

Wow, you have everything timed on there.

05:34.719 --> 05:35.640
It's amazing!

There's just nothing better than...

[Both] Being organized!

05:41.640 --> 05:44.359
Hey! Ollie! Look how fast I'm going.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.560
I've already done half of the row.

05:46.719 --> 05:48.400
Amazing, huh?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.640
I said... Amazing!

05:51.800 --> 05:53.039
Want to try?

-Thanks.

Oh, no! It's broken!

06:07.919 --> 06:10.320

06:10.479 --> 06:12.280
I'm really sorry.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.400
Don't worry, I never go anywhere
without a back-up tablet.

<i>You</i> have a back-up tablet?

Come on, guys. Try to keep up, OK?

06:30.680 --> 06:32.520
-You can take that row.
-Ooo.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.280
Oh, look there.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.799
[Giggles] Yay!

06:37.960 --> 06:41.440
I could have
a fancy calendar too, you know.

06:41.599 --> 06:42.919
I just don't want one.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.840
I don't need a fancy gizmo
to tell me what to do.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.440
Mm-hm!

06:48.719 --> 06:50.120
But, now that you mention it,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.680
what are we supposed to be doing now?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.560
Getting ahead of schedule, that's what!

06:55.719 --> 06:57.039
Ollie won't believe his eyes

06:57.200 --> 06:59.520
when he sees
how fast we staked these plants.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.719
I'll hand you the tape.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.240
You tie the plants to the stakes.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.760
You got it, Moon!

07:03.919 --> 07:07.560
Ollie, do you know
what you call a young tree?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.400
A sapling.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.640
[Ollie] Woah!

07:10.799 --> 07:12.239
You know what I love?

07:12.400 --> 07:15.080
[Both] Fun facts! [Giggle]

07:15.239 --> 07:18.159
Hurry, Stanley! I want Ollie to see this.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.919
[Stanley] Uhh,
maybe first you should see this?

07:21.400 --> 07:24.680
I had a <i>little</i> trouble
keeping up with you.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.280
Oh, no! Stanley! I'll save you. Hi-yah!

07:29.440 --> 07:31.479
-Ugh!
-Oof!

[Grunting]

07:34.239 --> 07:36.000
-Eek!
-Ugh...

07:36.159 --> 07:37.840
If you guys don't stop fooling around,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.799
we'll never get Beka ahead of schedule

07:39.960 --> 07:41.320
so we can get our Earth Day tree.

07:41.479 --> 07:42.359
But...

07:42.799 --> 07:45.200
-Hey! Woah, woah!
-Ahh!

07:45.359 --> 07:46.479

07:46.640 --> 07:48.560
-Did you see that?
-[Stanley] Oof.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.400
All I can see is sand.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.760
Ollie just got rid of us

07:51.919 --> 07:54.120
so he and Beka could be by themselves!

07:54.280 --> 07:56.599
I think he was trying to untangle us.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.039
No...

07:58.200 --> 08:00.400
Ollie's having so much fun with Beka,

08:00.560 --> 08:02.960
he's forgotten all about our tree.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.719
Just look at them.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.280
-[Giggles] This is pretty fun.
-I know, right?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.640

-Uh-oh.

Weather warning. It's about to get windy.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.520
Woah! Thanks for letting me know.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.000
[Chuckles] Sure!

08:15.159 --> 08:18.679
Maybe he doesn't want us
to plant a tree together anymore.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.760
Maybe he doesn't even want
to be my friend anymore.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.719
What? No!

08:23.880 --> 08:25.359
Not a chance!

08:25.520 --> 08:27.919
We've all been friends <i>forever</i> !

08:28.080 --> 08:29.280
Nothing could change that.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.960
Except maybe a new and improved friend.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.880
Well, that's fine. I don't even care!

08:36.559 --> 08:38.000
-[Ollie] Oh no!
-[Beka] Ah!

08:38.159 --> 08:40.720
The wind ruined all the work we just did.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.559
Moon, want to come help with this?

08:43.720 --> 08:44.760
No, thanks!

Seriously, Moon!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.160
Ahh!

08:53.319 --> 08:56.520
Sorry, we're having too much fun
doing friend-stuff together.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.480
We are? Mmm nom-nom-nom.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.760
Oh, no!

09:00.920 --> 09:03.920
The wind wrecked all the
planting I did yesterday too.

09:04.079 --> 09:05.400
I'm so behind now.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.840
I'll never catch up!

[Alarm sounds]

09:08.840 --> 09:10.000
Uhh, Moon...

09:10.160 --> 09:13.400
I think Ollie's actually in trouble.

09:13.560 --> 09:14.480
He is?

09:14.640 --> 09:17.079
This is a catastrophe!

09:17.240 --> 09:18.640
No, it's not, Beka.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.640
I know it looks hopeless,
but Moon can fix this.

Maybe you'd like to help us plant a tree?

Isn't it supposed to be <i>our</i> tree?

10:28.959 --> 10:30.959
Well, Stanley and I admit

10:31.120 --> 10:33.040
we were a little jealous at first.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.480
But we decided when it comes to friends,

10:35.640 --> 10:38.160
there's always room for one more.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.560
[Stanley] Amazing!

10:42.720 --> 10:44.000
So special.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.120
Wait...

10:49.280 --> 10:51.680
are we talking about the tree
or being best friends?

10:51.839 --> 10:53.040
A little bit of both, I guess.
