WEBVTT

00:07.678 --> 00:09.739
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.740 --> 00:13.743
WHY IS CHOCOLATE TOFU CHUNK
TAKING UP SPACE IN MY FREEZER?

00:13.744 --> 00:16.686
EXCUSE ME, YOUR FREEZER?

00:16.687 --> 00:18.748
FINE, YOUR FREEZER.

00:18.749 --> 00:21.121
THAT'S ICE CREAM
FOR MY BOYFRIEND.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.652
NOAH LIKES IT AND I LIKE NOAH,

00:22.653 --> 00:24.354
SO I WANT TO KEEP IT
AROUND FOR A TREAT,

00:24.355 --> 00:26.697
OR A POST-TREAT TREAT,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:28.399 --> 00:30.400
UNFORTUNATELY, I DO.

00:30.401 --> 00:31.731
YEAH, WELL, GET USED TO IT,

00:31.732 --> 00:34.064
BECAUSE I THINK THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAS REAL STAYING POWER.

00:34.065 --> 00:36.336
YEAH, I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.738
RIGHT AWAY, I KNEW WE
WERE A PERFECT MATCH.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.640
MEL BURKE, PUBLIC SERVANT.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.512
NOAH BUTLER, PUBLIC DEFENDER.

00:42.513 --> 00:45.246
AND I CAN TELL YOU HE IS AN
EXPERT AT GETTING PEOPLE OFF.

00:48.119 --> 00:49.519
ALL RIGHT, I SEE.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.722
THERE WAS A DOUBLE MEANING THERE.
THAT'S GROSS.

00:53.584 --> 00:56.386
ANYWAY, IT'S BEEN 12 WEEKS,
SO WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH

00:56.387 --> 00:57.657
STAGE ONE OF MY FIVE-STAGE PLAN.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.689
DO YOU WANNA HEAR ALL FIVE
STAGES OF MY FIVE-STAGE PLAN?

00:59.690 --> 01:01.831
I DON'T REALLY THINK
I HAVE A CHOICE.

01:01.832 --> 01:03.833
STAGE ONE: GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER, SIX MONTHS.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.536
STAGE TWO: TALK ABOUT MOVING
IN, ANOTHER SIX MONTHS.

01:06.537 --> 01:09.199
STAGE THREE: MOVE IN TOGETHER,
TALK ABOUT MARRIAGE,

01:09.200 --> 01:12.102
GET A DOG, NAME IT SOMETHING
CUTE LIKE GARY OR BEANS,

01:12.103 --> 01:15.805
12 MONTHS. STAGE FOUR: GET
MARRIED, TALK ABOUT KIDS.

01:15.806 --> 01:18.549
STAGE FIVE: MASON, BRADY
AND LITTLE BABY TUCKER.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.513
YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE STAGE WHERE
YOU GET YOUR HEAD EXAMINED.

01:23.784 --> 01:27.417
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
YOUR PRACTICAL, RATIONAL PLAN?

01:27.418 --> 01:28.858
YEAH, I DON'T THINK I
REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

01:28.859 --> 01:31.461
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CRAP
OUT IN STAGE THREE?

01:31.462 --> 01:34.194
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS. YOU'RE GONNA
SLIDE ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN TO STAGE ONE...

01:34.195 --> 01:36.166
EXCEPT YOU'RE GONNA
BE THREE YEARS OLDER.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.797
AND WE BOTH KNOW YOU JUST
HAD A LITTLE BIRTHDAY

01:37.798 --> 01:40.771
THAT RHYMES WITH,
UM, SHMIRTY-SHMIVE.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.174
HEY, I LOOK DAMN GOOD
FOR SHMIRTY-SHMIVE.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.676
I'M JUST SAYING YOUR
PLAN TAKES WAY TOO LONG.

01:46.677 --> 01:48.878
COME ON, BURKE, HOW MANY LAUNCH
WINDOWS DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

01:48.879 --> 01:53.414
WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST...
JUST COOK?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.716
I THINK THESE EGGS
HAVE GONE BAD.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.589
SHUT UP! YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING!

01:59.590 --> 02:01.292
OH, THOSE EGGS.

02:02.353 --> 02:04.894
CARRY ON. ( clears throat )

02:04.895 --> 02:06.496
( theme music playing )

02:06.497 --> 02:11.902
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE
STUCK WITH ME.. ♪

02:13.804 --> 02:16.606
WHOO-HOO! I GOT IT! I
GOT THE INTERNSHIP.

02:16.607 --> 02:17.707
CONGRATULATIONS, LEN.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.369
I'M WORKING AT THE
"TOLEDO BLADE."

02:19.370 --> 02:21.341
I'M OFFICIALLY A JOURNALIST.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.614
WELL, ACTUALLY,
AN UNPAID INTERN.

02:24.615 --> 02:26.446
DIDN'T LIKE 80 PEOPLE
TRY OUT FOR THAT JOB?

02:26.447 --> 02:28.219
MM-HMM. AND I CRUSHED THEM ALL.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.321
THAT'S MY LITTLE KILLER.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.852
I START TOMORROW
AT THE CITY DESK.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.784
IT'S THE HUB OF THE
ENTIRE NEWSPAPER.

02:34.785 --> 02:37.427
EVERYTHING FLOWS THROUGH ME
AND OUT TO THE REPORTERS.

02:37.428 --> 02:39.689
OH, PLUS I GET TO LISTEN
TO THE POLICE SCANNER.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.633
OOH, IF YOU HEAR ABOUT ANY
SPEED TRAPS, TEXT ME.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.335
SO I CAN DRIVE EXTRA CAREFUL

02:45.336 --> 02:47.337
- LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK

02:47.338 --> 02:49.499
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON THE
ROAD WHEN I'M AT THE DESK.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.740
IT'S MORNINGS FROM 6:00 TO 8:00.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.572
WOW! I'M IMPRESSED, LENNOX.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.274
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY A MORNING PERSON.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.175
MORNING? ( laughs )

02:56.176 --> 02:58.578
YOU'RE BARELY LIKE
A NOON PERSON.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.451
I FIGURE IF I CUT MY HAIR AND
MAKEUP ROUTINE DOWN TO 40 MINUTES,

03:01.452 --> 03:03.353
I DON'T HAVE TO GET
UP UNTIL 4:30.

03:03.354 --> 03:04.854
OH, 4:30? OH, THAT'S GREAT.

03:04.855 --> 03:06.756
'CAUSE YOU'LL GET A
FULL TWO HOURS' SLEEP.

03:06.757 --> 03:10.590
( scoffs ) WOULD IT KILL YOU TO
BELIEVE IN ME EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.191
YEAH, JEEZ, JOE.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.464
WOULD IT KILL YOU TO BELIEVE
IN HER EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

03:14.465 --> 03:16.226
YOU REALLY THINK SHE
CAN GET UP AT 4:30?

03:16.227 --> 03:17.598
SHE STILL IN THE ROOM?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.900
- NO.
- NO, NOT REALLY.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.333
( knocks )

03:25.806 --> 03:27.707
- HEY, LITTLE POOKIE.
- HEY. HEY, BIG POOKIE.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.679
- MMM-MMM-MMM-MMM.
- ( door closes )

03:29.680 --> 03:31.542
I'M JUST GONNA CALL YOU
"NOAH" IF THAT'S OKAY.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.345
SURPRISE, I BROUGHT YOU THESE.
MY GIFT.

03:35.346 --> 03:38.918
WOW. NO BOY HAS EVER GIVEN ME RAW,
CUT UP CHICKEN PIECES BEFORE.

03:38.919 --> 03:43.323
- I MEAN, WHO NEEDS FLOWERS AND JEWELRY?
- SO GET THIS...

03:43.324 --> 03:45.695
I HAD TO EMPTY MY REFRIGERATOR AND
LEAVE MY APARTMENT RIGHT AWAY.

03:45.696 --> 03:48.398
MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR'S TUB
OVERFLOWED AND MY PLACE GOT FLOODED.

03:48.399 --> 03:51.401
OH, SO NOW YOU'VE
GOT AN INDOOR POOL.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.403
A CARPETED ONE, YEAH.

03:53.404 --> 03:55.505
ANYWAY, THEY SAID IT'S GONNA TAKE
A WEEK FOR THE PLACE TO DRY OUT,

03:55.506 --> 03:57.968
SO I'M JUST GONNA RUN DOWNTOWN
AND GET A HOTEL ROOM.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.741
WAIT! WHY DON'T YOU, UMM,

04:01.742 --> 04:04.844
- MOVE IN HERE?
- REALLY? HERE?

04:04.845 --> 04:08.818
- LIKE HERE HERE?
- SURE. WHY STAY IN AN EXPENSIVE HOTEL?

04:08.819 --> 04:11.281
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT? FREE PORN
AND AND LITTLE SHAMPOO BOTTLES?

04:11.282 --> 04:13.723
WE'VE GOT THAT HERE!

04:13.724 --> 04:15.855
HERE, THESE ARE FOR YOU.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.827
YOU CAN STAY HERE UNTIL
YOUR PLACE IS CLEANED UP.

04:17.828 --> 04:19.829
KEYS. SWEET.

04:19.830 --> 04:22.592
SO WHAT EXACTLY
IS THE RENT HERE?

04:22.593 --> 04:25.695
OH, WELL, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT A BARTER ARRANGEMENT.

04:25.696 --> 04:26.896
PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT

04:26.897 --> 04:28.638
AND WE CAN BARTER EVERY
NIGHT THIS WEEK.

04:28.639 --> 04:31.441
I'M EVEN A FAN OF
MORNING BARTERING.

04:31.442 --> 04:33.304
- I'M GONNA GET MY THINGS.
- MM-HMM.

04:36.807 --> 04:39.278
OKAY, SO I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE AN IMPULSE SHOPPER,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.581
BUT THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT WAS
COMPLETELY OFF THE RAILS.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.653
NO, THAT WAS ON THE RAILS.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.686
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT MY FIVE-STAGE PLAN
BEING TOO SLOW MADE A LOT OF SENSE.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.588
I JUST PUT THIS RELATIONSHIP
IN THE MICROWAVE.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.391
ZIP, DING, DONE.

04:52.623 --> 04:54.324
BURKE, EVERYTHING THAT
GOES INTO A MICROWAVE

04:54.325 --> 04:56.826
COMES OUT BURNING
HOT AND TASTELESS.

04:56.827 --> 04:59.569
YEAH, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
THREE YEARS TO EAT MY DINNER.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.471
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

05:01.472 --> 05:03.733
JUDGING BY THE UNHAPPY
LOOKS ON YOUR FACES,

05:03.734 --> 05:05.936
I'M GUESSING YOU GUYS WERE
INTERACTING IN SOME WAY.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.939
NO, MEL'S... MEL'S BOYFRIEND
IS MOVING IN HERE.

05:09.940 --> 05:12.942
OH. SO THE HOUSE
RULES HAVE CHANGED?

05:12.943 --> 05:15.685
- JUST A SMIDGE.
- SO IF I HAVE A LADY FRIEND

05:15.686 --> 05:17.517
WHO WANTS TO STAY OVER...

05:17.518 --> 05:19.049
DUDE, THAT'S... THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:20.691 --> 05:23.393
- IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.
- NO, IT'S ONE STANDARD.

05:23.394 --> 05:24.755
YOU JUST DON'T MEET IT.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.000
( knocks ) LENNOX. YO.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.102
ARE YOU UP?

05:33.364 --> 05:35.034
HEY, LENNOX.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.766
COME ON, WAKE UP.
IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

05:36.767 --> 05:39.409
( moans ) GO AWAY.

05:39.410 --> 05:41.671
ISN'T TODAY THE FIRST
DAY OF YOUR INTERNSHIP?

05:41.672 --> 05:44.343
( gasps ) IT'S MY FIRST DAY!
I CAN'T BE LATE!

05:44.344 --> 05:47.477
WHERE'S MY PHONE? OKAY, WHERE'S MY PURSE?
WHERE'S MY PURSE?

05:47.478 --> 05:49.679
OKAY. JOE, GET OUT OF MY WAY!

05:49.680 --> 05:52.752
- GOSH, I CAN'T BE LATE.
- YOU...

05:52.753 --> 05:56.856
- ( whistles )
- I GOTTA CHANGE OUTTA MY PAJAMAS FIRST!

05:56.857 --> 05:57.758
THAT WAS A GOOD CATCH.

06:00.130 --> 06:02.832
( soft jazz music playing )

06:02.833 --> 06:04.794
MMM, YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

06:04.795 --> 06:07.737
THIS ANTIOXIDANT DECAFFEINATED
GREEN TEA IS GREAT.

06:07.738 --> 06:11.701
- ( door opens, closes )
- WHO NEEDS COFFEE WITH ITS DUMB OLD CAFFEINE?

06:11.702 --> 06:14.404
THIS EGG WHITE SCRAMBLE
WAS FANTASTIC.

06:14.405 --> 06:16.406
- MMM.
- THANKS, LITTLE POOKIE.

06:16.407 --> 06:20.049
YEAH, WELL, BE PREPARED FOR AN INCREDIBLE
BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING, BIG POOKIE.

06:20.050 --> 06:23.112
- OH.
- ( both moan )

06:23.113 --> 06:25.785
OH, HEY, LOOK AT THAT. I HATE TO PRY
MYSELF AWAY FROM THE GOOD LIFE,

06:25.786 --> 06:27.887
BUT I GOTTA GET READY FOR WORK.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.760
- MMM.
- MWAH!

06:30.721 --> 06:32.892
SO... LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.927
YOU, MEL BURKE, A.K.A.
LITTLE POOKIE...

06:38.729 --> 06:40.470
YOU MADE BREAKFAST? WHAT,
DID YOU LOSE A BET?

06:40.471 --> 06:42.071
NOT AT ALL. THIS IS STAGE THREE.

06:42.072 --> 06:44.434
- BLISSFULLY LIVING TOGETHER.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.405
NUH-UH, THAT'S STAGE ONE
LINGERIE RIGHT THERE.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.738
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IN
STAGE THREE YOU GO TO SLEEP

06:48.739 --> 06:49.879
WEARING SWEATS AND
RATTY OLD T-SHIRTS.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.782
PLUS YOU'RE WEARING
LIPSTICK AT BREAKFAST.

06:52.783 --> 06:54.413
AND WHY ARE WE LISTENING

06:54.414 --> 06:57.787
TO THE SOUNDTRACK
OF "27 DRESSES"?

06:57.788 --> 06:59.889
- ( music stops )
- BECAUSE I LISTEN TO MUSIC EVERY MORNING.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.822
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN MEANING TO.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.794
BURKE, LIVING WITH SOMEBODY
IS ABOUT COMPROMISING

07:04.795 --> 07:07.557
AND LEARNING TO WORK TOGETHER. YOU TWO
GUYS ARE JUST PLAYING HOUSE HERE.

07:07.558 --> 07:09.859
- NO, THIS IS A REAL RELATIONSHIP.
- THIS IS REAL?!

07:09.860 --> 07:12.502
WHAT'S REAL ABOUT THIS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:12.503 --> 07:15.204
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S SOY DELICIOUS"?

07:15.205 --> 07:18.768
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?
WHAT, DECAFFEINATED GREEN TEA?

07:18.769 --> 07:21.841
WE BOTH KNOW YOU'RE A BARKING MONSTER
WITHOUT YOUR COFFEE IN THE MORNING.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.973
I AM NOT! NOW SHUT YOUR YAPPER

07:23.974 --> 07:26.676
AND MAKE ME A POT OF COFFEE
BEFORE I GET THE SHAKES.

07:26.677 --> 07:30.850
SEE? NOW THERE'S THE MEL BURKE I
KNOW AND CAN BARELY TOLERATE.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.883
COFFEE! NOW!

07:40.561 --> 07:42.061
IT WAS A HORRIBLE FIRST DAY.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.565
MR. PIKE SAID I HAVE TO BE THERE
ON TIME OR I'M GONNA GET FIRED.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.838
I WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES LATE. WHAT
DIFFERENCE DOES FIVE MINUTES MAKE?

07:48.839 --> 07:50.800
IN THE NEWS BUSINESS, I THINK
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

07:50.801 --> 07:53.472
"THE SHIP'S ABOUT
TO SINK" AND...

07:53.473 --> 07:55.546
"IT WAS THERE A MINUTE AGO."

07:56.547 --> 07:57.647
LENNOX, HONEY,

07:57.648 --> 07:59.849
BEING ON TIME IS "WORK 101."

07:59.850 --> 08:01.781
MY FIRST JOB I WAS
A SHOT-GLASS GIRL

08:01.782 --> 08:03.583
AT A BAR IN DAYTONA BEACH.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.055
I WAS UNDERAGE, I WAS
SKIMMING CASH OFF THE TILL,

08:06.056 --> 08:08.818
BUT I WAS NEVER EVER LATE.

08:08.819 --> 08:10.960
YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST SAID
THAT YOU WERE NEVER LATE?

08:10.961 --> 08:13.563
LOOK, I KNOW YOU CAN PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER AND DO THIS,

08:13.564 --> 08:17.096
- 'CAUSE YOU ARE MY BIG GIRL.
- I HATE WHEN YOU CALL ME YOUR BIG GIRL.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.068
MMM, ME TOO. IT
MAKES ME FEEL OLD.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.231
HOW ABOUT "YOU ROCK, MY SISTA"?

08:22.232 --> 08:23.874
NOW YOU SOUND EVEN OLDER.

08:25.135 --> 08:26.677
AND WE'RE BACK TO "BIG GIRL."

08:28.208 --> 08:30.610
YOU KNOW, LENNOX, I
THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

08:30.611 --> 08:32.181
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
WAKE YOURSELF UP ON TIME.

08:32.182 --> 08:36.015
( scoffs ) ANY IDIOT CAN WAKE UP
ON TIME AND STOP NANNYING ME.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.618
HEY, I'M THE NANNY. THAT'S
WHAT I DO, ALL RIGHT?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.751
IT'S WHY I GET PAID THE...

08:41.752 --> 08:43.293
HUMILIATING BUCKS.

08:46.597 --> 08:49.899
( knocks ) HERE I AM, ROOMIE.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.601
SHARING THE BATHROOM WITH YA.

08:51.602 --> 08:55.534
IN MY FLANNELS WITH THE HAPPY
ELEPHANTS, 'CAUSE I'M REAL.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.066
- YOU'RE REAL CUTE.
- OH. ( giggles )

08:57.067 --> 08:58.938
THAT'S WHAT THE FELLERS SAY.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.310
HEY, WHAT'S THE BATH
MAT DOING THERE?

09:01.311 --> 09:03.613
THAT'S NOT WHERE
THE BATH MAT GOES.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.174
- OH YEAH, I MOVED IT.
- BUT, WELL...

09:05.175 --> 09:07.677
BUT I LIKE MY BATH MAT
IN FRONT OF THE TOILET.

09:07.678 --> 09:10.179
THAT'S WHY I PUT
IT THERE, POOKIE.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.822
I JUST THOUGHT IT MAKES
A LITTLE MORE SENSE

09:12.823 --> 09:14.083
TO PUT IT IN FRONT OF THE SINK,

09:14.084 --> 09:15.185
'CAUSE YOU SPEND
MORE TIME THERE.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.288
WELL, HEY, MY FREEZING
TOES CAN ADJUST.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.891
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE IN
STAGE THREE... I MEAN, TOGETHER.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.563
YOU KNOW, YOU TALK ABOUT THE LITTLE
HICCUPS AND YOU WORK THEM OUT.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.065
- SO CUTE.
- ( laughs )

09:26.066 --> 09:28.297
- AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HICCUPS...
- OH, WE ARE.

09:28.298 --> 09:30.670
...THAT LOTION THAT YOU PUT
ON BEFORE YOU GO TO BED?

09:30.671 --> 09:33.102
THE ONE FROM FRANCE?
THAT I LOVE?

09:33.103 --> 09:36.746
THAT MANY FRENCH BEES
GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR?

09:36.747 --> 09:39.048
YEAH, IT'S GOT A
REALLY STRONG SMELL.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.950
IT SORTA GIVES ME A HEADACHE.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.712
OH, OKAY.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.815
OH, WELL, I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.858
- THANKS, BABE.
- YEAH.

09:48.859 --> 09:50.821
IT WAS MAKING MY HANDS
WAY TOO SOFT ANYWAY.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.799
- OH, ONE MORE LITTLE THING.
- OH GOODIE.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.902
YOU KNOW HOW YOU LIKE TO
SLEEP WITH THE WINDOW OPEN

10:02.903 --> 10:04.073
AND ALL THE BLANKETS PILED ON?

10:04.074 --> 10:06.175
AND YOU LOVE IT TOO?

10:06.176 --> 10:09.909
WELL, WHAT IF YOU DON'T
OPEN THE WINDOW?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.111
THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO
PILE ON ALL THE BLANKETS.

10:12.112 --> 10:16.817
- IT'S LOGICAL, RIGHT?
- YUP. YEAH, NOTHING IS COZIER THAN LOGIC.

10:18.048 --> 10:19.289
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER.

10:34.905 --> 10:37.207
( rapid knocking )

10:40.640 --> 10:43.143
- YEAH, WHAT?
- SMELL THIS.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.076
I SEE THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

10:47.077 --> 10:49.919
- WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE TO YOU?
- IT SMELLS LIKE YOU.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.252
- AND DOES IT GIVE YOU A HEADACHE?
- YOU DO SOMETIMES.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.324
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE MOISTURIZER, THOUGH.

10:55.325 --> 10:57.727
NOAH DOESN'T WANT ME
TO USE THIS ANYMORE.

10:57.728 --> 11:01.731
YEAH, AND HE MADE THIS FASCIST
CLOSED-WINDOW-NO-BLANKET DECREE.

11:01.732 --> 11:03.093
I CAN'T SLEEP IN THERE.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.937
- YOU CAN BUNK IN HERE IF YOU WANT.
- THANKS, LONGO.

11:07.938 --> 11:09.269
SURE. WHAT ARE YOU...?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.773
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.105
I WAS REALLY TRYING
TO DO STAGE THREE.

11:16.106 --> 11:18.077
I WAS COMPROMISING,
I WAS ADJUSTING

11:18.078 --> 11:19.408
AND IT WAS KILLING ME!

11:19.409 --> 11:20.910
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
MOVING TOO FAST.

11:20.911 --> 11:23.813
IT TAKES YEARS TO SMOOTH
OVER THE ROUGH PATCHES.

11:23.814 --> 11:25.985
YOU CAN'T BEND A MAN TO
YOUR WILL OVERNIGHT.

11:25.986 --> 11:30.720
A WOMAN IS LIKE... A RIVER
THAT RUSHES AND POUNDS

11:30.721 --> 11:32.762
FOR YEARS AGAINST THE
MIGHTY MOUNTAIN,

11:32.763 --> 11:34.865
WEARING IT DOWN UNTIL
EVENTUALLY IT'S JUST...

11:35.866 --> 11:36.927
THE GRAND CANYON.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.929
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU ARE SO WISE.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.132
YEAH, WELL... I'VE BEEN POUNDED.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.876
HEY... ( exhales )

11:46.877 --> 11:48.978
- IS THAT GOOD?
- YEAH.

11:48.979 --> 11:51.941
- GOOD NIGHT, LONGO.
- GOOD NIGHT, BURKE. SWEET DREAMS.

11:51.942 --> 11:55.184
OH, AND I DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT
HOW HE TRIED TO KIDNAP MY BATH MAT.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.347
HEY, BURKE, THIS IS
NOT A SLUMBER PARTY.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.994
( beeps )

12:04.995 --> 12:07.197
( beeps )

12:08.999 --> 12:11.931
( beeps )

12:11.932 --> 12:13.934
( clatters )

12:15.906 --> 12:18.838
- FOR GOD'S SAKES, LENNOX,
- HEY HEY HEY.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.140
- WE ARE GONNA LET HER SLEEP.
- WHAT ABOUT LETTING ME SLEEP?

12:21.141 --> 12:24.844
IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN THAT REST
PREVENTS PIMPLES. LOOK AT MY SKIN.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.245
- ( alarm buzzing )
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.977
- I SAID LET IT RING, DUDE.
- ( alarm clatters )

12:27.978 --> 12:29.979
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I AM DOING HER A FAVOR.
IT'S CALLED TOUGH LOVE.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.851
IF I WAKE HER UP RIGHT NOW,
I'M NOT GONNA BE HELPING HER.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.422
INTERNSHIPS ARE ABOUT
LEARNING THINGS

12:33.423 --> 12:36.185
AND LENNOX IS LEARNING A VERY
VALUABLE LESSON RIGHT NOW.

12:36.186 --> 12:39.129
YEAH. YEAH, THAT YOU'RE
KIND OF A SUCK-WAD SADIST.

12:41.491 --> 12:43.063
( alarm beeping )

12:50.070 --> 12:52.201
HEY, THANKS FOR LETTING ME CRASH
ON YOUR COUCH LAST NIGHT.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.504
NO PROBLEM, AS LONG AS IT
NEVER EVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.307
ARE YOU GONNA GO FOR THAT
PHONY-BALONEY HERBAL TEA AGAIN?

12:58.308 --> 13:00.851
PFFT! SCREW THAT. I'M
GOING STRAIGHT COLUMBIAN.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.554
MMM. MMM. THAT'S MUY BIEN.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.487
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID LAST NIGHT AND I GET IT.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.860
BEFORE WE WEAR DOWN THE
LITTLE BUMPS IN THE ROAD,

13:10.861 --> 13:12.291
WE HAVE TO WEAR DOWN
THE BIGGER ONES.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.863
IN TWO DAYS, NOAH GOES
BACK TO HIS PLACE

13:13.864 --> 13:15.965
AND IT'LL TAKE ALL THE
PRESSURE OFF THE RELATIONSHIP.

13:15.966 --> 13:18.898
I CAN SURVIVE WITH DRY
HANDS FOR TWO DAYS.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
YOU ARE NAVY SEAL
MATERIAL, BURKE.

13:22.332 --> 13:25.134
MORNING, GORGEOUS. HEY, JOE.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.906
- HEY.
- ( chuckles )

13:26.907 --> 13:29.939
MWAH. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU, BUT I SLEPT FANTASTIC.

13:29.940 --> 13:30.941
SO DID MEL.

13:32.382 --> 13:33.913
I'M GUESSING.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.515
ANYWAY, I GOT THIS EMAIL
FROM MY APARTMENT MANAGER,

13:36.516 --> 13:37.847
IT TURNS OUT THEY FOUND
MOLD IN THE WALLS,

13:37.848 --> 13:39.148
SO THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GUT THE PLACE.

13:39.149 --> 13:41.420
- GUT THE PLACE?
- IS THAT SOMETHING THEY CAN...

13:41.421 --> 13:43.322
THEY CAN FIX IN TWO DAYS?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.055
IT'S MORE LIKE A COUPLE
OF MONTHS, YEAH.

13:46.056 --> 13:48.027
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS I'LL BE STAYING
HERE WITH YOU A LITTLE LONGER.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.230
- ( chuckles )
- I MEAN, IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

13:51.401 --> 13:53.033
WELL...

13:57.267 --> 14:00.870
TWO MONTHS. LIVING HERE.
WITH ME.

14:00.871 --> 14:02.611
WOW. THAT IS QUITE
AN ATTRACTIVE OFFER,

14:02.612 --> 14:06.576
BUT... WELL, I HAVE TO BE
TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.

14:08.318 --> 14:10.519
I AM HAVING A CONTRACTOR
START WORK HERE NEXT WEEK.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.352
YEAH, HE'S TEARING OUT
THE HEATING AND AIR...

14:13.353 --> 14:16.055
LOTS OF DUCT PROBLEMS.

14:16.056 --> 14:19.488
HE'S GOTTA TOTALLY...
DE-DUCT THEM.

14:19.489 --> 14:21.430
YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE A REAL MESS.
RIGHT, JOE?

14:21.431 --> 14:23.292
YUP.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.996
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF MESSED-UP
STUFF GOING ON INSIDE THIS HOUSE.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.867
YEAH, I'M GONNA BE STAYING
IN LENNOX'S ROOM,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.901
SO I'M SORRY, NO
ROOM AT THE INN.

14:31.902 --> 14:34.873
OH, WELL, YOU CAN'T HELP
WHAT HAS TO BE DONE, RIGHT?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.007
- I'LL JUST MOVE OUT OF YOUR HOUSE LIKE WE PLANNED.
- MMM.

14:43.313 --> 14:44.613
- ( door closes )
- IT WOULD BE SO GREAT

14:44.614 --> 14:46.355
IF YOU'D JUST LET THIS GO
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING,

14:46.356 --> 14:48.457
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, IS IT?

14:48.458 --> 14:50.260
NOT A FRIGGING CHANCE.

14:51.361 --> 14:52.661
WHY DID YOU JUST
LIE TO THAT GUY?

14:52.662 --> 14:54.994
BECAUSE I HONESTLY BELIEVE
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.665
BUT IF HE KEEPS LIVING
HERE, IT'S DOOMED.

14:56.666 --> 14:58.928
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
FAST-TRACKED THIS RELATIONSHIP.

14:58.929 --> 15:00.169
IT'S TIME TO GO
BACK TO STAGE ONE.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.201
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU PUT YOUR
BOYFRIEND IN THE MICROWAVE

15:02.202 --> 15:04.534
AND NOW YOU WANNA GO BACK AND
PUT HIM ON A SLOW SIMMER?

15:05.936 --> 15:07.576
- THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

15:07.577 --> 15:10.109
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER COOKED A MAN?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.283
I KNOW ONCE YOU'VE BURNED 'EM, IT'S
TIME TO MOVE ON TO A NEW PIECE OF MEAT.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.544
OH MY GOD.

15:15.545 --> 15:18.348
THIS IS GONNA BE SO EPIC.
JUST WAIT FOR IT.

15:20.650 --> 15:22.651
MY FUTURE IS RUINED!

15:22.652 --> 15:24.593
I JUST CALLED MY BOSS TO
TELL HIM I WAS RUNNING LATE,

15:24.594 --> 15:28.097
AND HE TOLD ME NOT TO BOTHER
COMING IN, AT ALL. EVER. DONE!

15:28.098 --> 15:30.460
HOW COULD HE FIRE ME? HE
WASN'T EVEN PAYING ME.

15:31.601 --> 15:33.202
LENNOX, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAKE UP

15:33.203 --> 15:34.533
WHEN YOUR ALARM
GOES OFF NEXT TIME.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.705
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY
ALARMS MALFUNCTIONED.

15:36.706 --> 15:38.968
ALL OF THEM.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.240
REALLY? 'CAUSE I WAS WALKING
BY YOUR ROOM ABOUT 5:00 A.M.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.213
AND I SAW YOU HITTING SNOOZE BUTTONS
LIKE YOU WERE PLAYING WHACK-A-MOLE.

15:44.214 --> 15:47.576
WAIT. YOU WERE THERE AND
YOU DIDN'T WAKE ME UP?

15:47.577 --> 15:50.219
- I WANTED TO, BELIEVE ME.
- I WANTED TO, TOO,

15:50.220 --> 15:51.720
BUT JOE SAID IT WAS TOUGH LOVE.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.352
WAIT, YOU WERE THERE, TOO?

15:53.353 --> 15:55.585
I... I WAS SLEEPWALKING.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.689
AND I AM NOW.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.533
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

16:04.534 --> 16:07.266
LOOK, NOT WAKING YOU UP WAS
YOUR WAKE-UP CALL, ALL RIGHT?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.638
COME ON, LENNOX. HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET UP YOUR FIRST DAY IN COLLEGE?

16:09.639 --> 16:12.271
YOUR FIRST DAY AT YOUR REAL JOB?
GROWING UP MEANS

16:12.272 --> 16:14.443
YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF.

16:14.444 --> 16:17.646
YOU SET ME UP. YOU
WANTED ME TO FAIL.

16:17.647 --> 16:21.181
IT'S CALLED "TOUGH LOVE." I CAN'T
LEAVE OUT THE "TOUGH" PART.

16:24.354 --> 16:26.985
( both laughing )

16:26.986 --> 16:29.288
OH. UH, HEY, JOE.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.490
- OI.
- DON'T MIND HIM. HERE.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.992
TAKE THIS IN THE OTHER ROOM
AND WARM UP THE COUCH FOR ME.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.495
OKAY.

16:36.666 --> 16:40.329
SO HOW'D YOUR SLOW-COOKED
EVENING GO, HUH?

16:40.330 --> 16:43.632
- WHAT DID YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT?
- OH, THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF TALKING,

16:43.633 --> 16:46.035
THE LANGUAGE WAS
MOSTLY BODY LANGUAGE,

16:46.036 --> 16:48.038
WHICH IS MY NATIVE TONGUE.

16:49.379 --> 16:51.540
I THOUGHT YOU WENT BACK TO STAGE
ONE TO TALK ABOUT THE BIG STUFF?

16:51.541 --> 16:53.282
NO, THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER...

16:53.283 --> 16:56.485
NO STRESS, NO PRESSURE, NO NOTHING.
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.

16:56.486 --> 17:00.189
SOONER OR LATER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAKE UP FROM YOUR STAGE-ONE COMA.

17:00.190 --> 17:01.391
NUH-UH!

17:07.097 --> 17:08.327
HEY THERE, POOKSTERS.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.359
( chuckles ) I DON'T
MEAN TO INTERRUPT,

17:10.360 --> 17:12.261
BUT I WAS JUST READING
THIS MAGAZINE

17:12.262 --> 17:13.632
AND I CAME ACROSS A
VERY INTERESTING

17:13.633 --> 17:16.305
RELATIONSHIP QUIZ FOR COUPLES.
I MEAN, I'M NOT A COUPLE,

17:16.306 --> 17:17.806
BUT YOU GUYS ARE AND
A GREAT ONE AT THAT.

17:17.807 --> 17:20.369
- SO HOW ABOUT I GIVE IT TO YOU?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.312
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. IT'S
CALLED "IS IT MEANT TO BE

17:23.313 --> 17:25.215
OR MEANT TO BE OVER"?

17:26.216 --> 17:28.117
( laughs ) THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.579
- LET'S DO IT.
- YEAH, SURE, BECAUSE YOU HAD TWO MARGARITAS AT DINNER.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.521
THREE, AND I'M READY TO PLAY.

17:32.522 --> 17:35.384
SEE? LOOK AT THAT, HE'S READY TO PLAY.
I LIKE THIS GUY.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.126
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE
GO, FIRST QUESTION.

17:37.127 --> 17:38.757
- "DO YOU WANT KIDS?"
- Both: YES.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.329
- ALL RIGHT, "HOW MANY?"
- THREE.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.161
TWO, BUT I CAN DO THREE.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.263
- I BET YOU COULD.
- ( both laugh )

17:44.264 --> 17:46.064
YO YO YO YO. THANKS.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.568
OKAY, "WHERE DO YOU WANNA LIVE?
CITY, SUBURBS, PERSONAL ISLAND?"

17:49.569 --> 17:52.541
- Both: CITY.
- JINX. YOU OWE ME A KISS.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.704
- OKAY.
- HEY! ENOUGH OF THAT, ENOUGH OF THAT, ENOUGH OF THAT.

17:56.246 --> 17:59.077
OKAY, "SCHOOL? PUBLIC,
PRIVATE OR NUNS?"

17:59.078 --> 18:01.650
- PUBLIC.
- PUBLIC, BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

18:01.651 --> 18:03.712
YEAH, TWO OF THE CUTEST
PUBLIC OFFICIALS EVER.

18:03.713 --> 18:07.117
- WE ARE.
- OH MY GOD, CAN WE NOT CELEBRATE YET, PLEASE?

18:08.618 --> 18:10.589
- ON THE BEACH...
- AT SUNSET...

18:10.590 --> 18:13.392
- WITH 100 DOVES...
- AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.594
AND OUR DOG GARY CAN
BE THE RING BEARER.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.098
- HAH! MEANT TO BE.
- ( laughs )

18:20.200 --> 18:22.572
WOW. SO FAR, 18 FOR 18.

18:24.234 --> 18:26.235
I WAS WRONG. THIS...

18:26.236 --> 18:28.337
THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T
THAT MUCH FUN.

18:28.338 --> 18:30.139
WHOA WHOA WHOA,
QUIZMASTER, KEEP GOING.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.441
NO. WHAT'S THE POINT? YOU
GUYS ARE COMPATIBLE.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.683
WELL, COME ON, NEXT QUESTION.
WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY.

18:34.684 --> 18:36.146
OKAY.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.151
THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION.
THANK GOD.

18:42.752 --> 18:46.225
- "ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE?"
- ( sighs )

18:46.226 --> 18:47.827
- YES.
- WHAT?

18:49.229 --> 18:52.561
I... UM, HER NAME IS LARISSA.

18:52.562 --> 18:54.463
AND WE BROKE UP YEARS AGO,

18:54.464 --> 18:57.306
BUT YEAH, PART OF ME WILL ALWAYS
STILL BE IN LOVE WITH HER.

18:57.307 --> 18:59.768
BUT HEY, YOU'VE GOTTA MOVE
ON WITH YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?

18:59.769 --> 19:01.241
WOW.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.814
YOU WERE READY TO BE IN A SERIOUS,
COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WITH ME,

19:05.815 --> 19:08.477
WHILE THERE'S STILL SOMEONE ELSE YOU'RE
SECRETLY WISHING YOU COULD BE WITH?

19:08.478 --> 19:10.519
- I JUST WANNA BE HONEST.
- REALLY?

19:10.520 --> 19:12.251
I'M SECOND PLACE?

19:12.252 --> 19:13.852
WHOA WHOA, HOLD ON A SECOND.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.285
SHE'S ALREADY MARRIED, OKAY?

19:16.286 --> 19:18.587
AND DON'T WORRY,
BECAUSE AFTER HER,

19:18.588 --> 19:21.430
THERE IS NO ONE THAT I WOULD
RATHER BE WITH THAN YOU.

19:21.431 --> 19:24.834
WOW. THAT'S WHAT EVERY
WOMAN WANTS TO HEAR.

19:27.937 --> 19:30.640
IT SAYS HERE SOME MEN ACTUALLY
LIKE TO CUDDLE. HOW ABOUT THAT?

19:34.904 --> 19:37.307
( knocks ) HEY.

19:38.778 --> 19:42.681
HEY. I'M GUESSING YOU AREN'T
HERE TO SLEEP ON MY COUCH.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.654
NOPE. I'VE GOT MY OWN BED
ALL TO MYSELF AGAIN.

19:45.655 --> 19:48.657
SORRY, BURKE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
THROWN THAT STUPID QUIZ AT YOU.

19:48.658 --> 19:51.260
OH NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DID ME A FAVOR.

19:51.261 --> 19:54.394
IT WAS A WAKE-UP CALL, AND UNLIKE
LENNOX, I ACTUALLY WOKE UP.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.326
NOAH WASN'T THE GUY.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.628
BUT NOW I'VE GOT NO
GUY AND NO PLAN.

19:59.629 --> 20:02.271
AND IN A FEW YEARS
I'M GONNA BE...

20:02.272 --> 20:03.503
SHMORTY.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.375
RELAX, OKAY?

20:06.376 --> 20:07.976
LOOK, THERE'S SOMEBODY
OUT THERE FOR YA.

20:07.977 --> 20:09.978
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
TODAY MORE THAN EVER,

20:09.979 --> 20:12.311
WOMEN ARE HAVING KIDS
WELL INTO THEIR...

20:12.312 --> 20:14.283
SHMIFTIES.

20:14.284 --> 20:17.916
I DON'T KNOW. HOW AM I EVER GONNA
BE COMFORTABLE LIVING WITH ANYONE?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.718
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE PRETTY
COMFORTABLE RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.220
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S EASY
FOR ME TO BE MYSELF WITH YOU.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.722
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU THINK ABOUT ME.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.495
OH. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
THINK ABOUT ME EITHER.

20:26.496 --> 20:28.597
SEE? THIS IS WHY WE
GET ALONG SO WELL.

20:28.598 --> 20:31.430
BECAUSE DEEPLY, WAY DOWN DEEP,

20:31.431 --> 20:33.732
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.734
HEY, YOU DON'T HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY...

20:35.735 --> 20:38.006
AH. YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

20:38.007 --> 20:39.469
THAT I DO, BURKE.

20:40.510 --> 20:41.741
THAT I DO.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.578
SO, MR. PIKE, HONESTLY,

20:49.579 --> 20:52.250
IT'S REALLY KIND OF MY FAULT
THAT LENNOX DIDN'T SHOW UP.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.323
I SHOULD'VE WOKEN
HER AND I DIDN'T.

20:54.324 --> 20:57.786
- YOU SEE, SIR...
- ( angry chatter )

20:57.787 --> 21:01.830
WOW. HONESTLY, A SIMPLE
NO WOULD'VE SUFFICED.

21:01.831 --> 21:03.692
( angry chatter )

21:03.693 --> 21:04.893
AND YOUR MOTHER, TOO.

21:04.894 --> 21:07.366
HELLO?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.467
- ( beeps )
- HEY, JOE.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.640
- HEY.
- THANKS.

21:11.641 --> 21:13.702
FOR WHAT? I COULDN'T
GET YOUR JOB BACK.

21:13.703 --> 21:15.444
YEAH, BUT YOU TRIED.

21:15.445 --> 21:18.777
AND IT IS MY FAULT. I
SHOULD'VE GOTTEN MYSELF UP.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.009
- YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU SHOULD HAVE. MAYBE NEXT TIME...
- ( exasperated sigh )

21:21.010 --> 21:23.453
YOU CAN'T EVEN BE
GRACIOUS FOR 10 SECONDS.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.685
I COULD IF I WANTED TO!
