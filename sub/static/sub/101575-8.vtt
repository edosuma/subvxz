[narrator]
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek Discovery:

00:13.972 --> 00:16.349
Osyraa and the Chain
have been pushing hard lately.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.934
Osyraa breaks people.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.228
Ryn the Andorian
was born into the Emerald Chain.

00:20.311 --> 00:22.647
Tried to rally the people.
People were beginning to listen,

00:22.731 --> 00:24.149
so she hacked off his antennae.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.608
[Georgiou] Who put you in charge?

00:25.692 --> 00:26.943
[Tolor] I'm Osyraa's nephew.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.237
Lieutenant Detmer, get us over there.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.408
-You did great.
-Closer call than it should've been.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.411
I would like you to serve
as acting First Officer

00:36.494 --> 00:40.040
-until I find a permanent replacement.
-[Stamets] You're talking to yourself?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.459
I was talking to my boyfriend, Gray.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.835
He says he likes you.

00:43.918 --> 00:48.548
We found significant new evidence
related to the cause of the Burn.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.467
SB-19 can help us with that.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.135
I will convene a quorum.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.596
[Burnham] It's the only way we'll have
a chance at that data.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.014
This could help us solve the Burn.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.061
-How long has this been happening?
-Couple weeks.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.937
And it's getting more severe.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.440
You're not alone. We'll get through this.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.114
Where I'm from,
the emperor's personal physicians

01:13.198 --> 01:15.742
were buried with them when they died.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.411
It incentivized loyalty.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.455
Are you gonna answer my question?

01:21.706 --> 01:24.084
When did you first experience blackouts?

01:24.667 --> 01:27.295
-I don't need your help.
-Your condition is serious,

01:27.378 --> 01:29.088
but since you don't wanna cooperate,

01:29.172 --> 01:31.758
you can determine if the root
is physiological, psychological,

01:31.841 --> 01:35.136
temporal, or interdimensional on your own.
And get back to me.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.472
-You don't scare me, human.
-I don't need to.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.098
You're already terrified.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.728
I realize...

01:44.938 --> 01:49.150
you see yourself as the grand hero,
oracle of the mess hall,

01:49.234 --> 01:52.695
savior man to this ship.
Well, I'm not interested.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.619
Your early stages of brain dysfunction
will feel manageable.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.331
"What was I just doing?
Where did I bury that last body?"

02:03.414 --> 02:06.376
But eventually, if we don't intervene...

02:07.752 --> 02:12.173
you won't recognize the faces around you.
You won't even recognize yourself.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.010
You'll end your days
howling at the reflection in the mirror,

02:16.094 --> 02:18.304
a living death,
that's not what I want for you.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.225
If I had time, I'd poison your children.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.562
If I had time, I'd have children.
Now, do you want my help or not?

02:30.024 --> 02:34.362
For such a warm and fuzzy human,
you've got very cold hands.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.156
He's just getting your baselines.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.283
More than that, actually.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.619
The scan will deconstruct
your entire body, system by system.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.914
Once we can see
what's happening on an atomic level,

02:44.998 --> 02:46.708
hopefully we'll have a roadmap for a cure.

02:46.791 --> 02:49.752
[scoffs] Nine hundred and thirty years
of medical advancement,

02:49.836 --> 02:53.381
and you still need fancy equipment
to deconstruct me?

02:53.464 --> 02:58.386
I could deconstruct the both of you with
a snappy insult and a withering glance.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.430
Congratulations,
your mother must be very proud.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.099
-[both] I killed her.
-No, you did not, by the way.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.686
We're gonna figure this out.
I'm not leaving until we do.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.937
[monitor beeping]

03:09.230 --> 03:12.650
-[Culber] Her heart rate is elevated.
-It's rage.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.823
Why don't I check in later?

03:19.490 --> 03:20.575
[Georgiou] Don't bother.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.454
-I'll call for you if you're needed.
-She won't be.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.546
[woman over PA] <i>Security briefing</i>
<i>on Deck 7 in five minutes.</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:35.214
-Hey. Sorry.
-Hey.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.050
-I'm glad I found you.
-What is it?

03:37.133 --> 03:39.677
-I have to go home. Kwejian.
-Home?

03:39.761 --> 03:42.347
-"Home" home?
-My brother Kyheem got a message to me

03:42.430 --> 03:44.849
through the courier network. I have to go.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.477
-Come with me?
-Hold on.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.688
It's Osyraa and the Emerald Chain.
He's dealt with them for 15 years,

03:50.772 --> 03:53.107
haven't heard from him once.
It must be bad.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.902
Kwejian is two weeks away at full warp.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.946
-Okay.
-We've less than a 50 percent chance

03:58.029 --> 04:00.949
-of surviving a transwarp tunnel.
-She's gonna destroy my planet.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.075
Then we'll need help.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.578
[Booker] When the Burn hit, damage
to subspace shifted our moon's orbit,

04:05.662 --> 04:06.746
causing tidal changes.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.999
Sea locusts came out of the ocean
and ate our harvest.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
Millions were starving.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.088
-Then the Chain came.
-[Vance] Let me guess,

04:15.171 --> 04:17.090
they had the solution to your problems.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.385
They offered us--
I guess you'd call it a repellent.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.221
Assured us it was a humane way
to get them back into the sea.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.058
It saved our harvest, but we had to
give them our Tranceworms in exchange.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.060
Now Osyraa's back.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.145
-Any idea why?
-I don't know.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.064
You don't seem surprised, sir.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.361
The Chain's turned Prime Directive
violations into an art form.

04:38.444 --> 04:42.031
They make reckless contact
with pre-warp civilizations

04:42.115 --> 04:43.658
that have something they want.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.870
Right now, I'm tracking 50 star systems
in the same predicament.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.748
Most, if not all, are bound to collapse.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.417
Must we not intercede?

04:52.500 --> 04:56.170
I don't have the ships to spare,
and I'm not risking your spore drive.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.757
All I need is transport.
My brother will know what Osyraa wants.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.884
What if she wants something
you can't give?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.220
It's not just Osyraa
and not just this quadrant.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.139
We have to do something.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.727
I propose we go in under
the technical designation of observers.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.813
If Osyraa feels the presence
of the Federation,

05:13.896 --> 05:17.191
she may be inclined to pursue
a more diplomatic approach.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.073
We'll take a defensive posture

05:24.157 --> 05:27.577
and jump away at the slightest indication
that <i>Discovery</i> is in danger.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.954
-Aye.
-Keep your eyes open, captain.

05:30.038 --> 05:34.083
I'm not betting on diplomacy. You have
no idea what Osyraa is capable of.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.088
[Tolor] All my workers ran off.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.968
I did everything I knew
how to do, Aunt Osyraa.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.180
I hope you believe me.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.058
I don't.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.393
You lost Ryn?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.145
Ryn?

05:56.064 --> 05:59.108
Oh, right, the Andorian.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.697
-He left with a courier. Cleveland Booker.
-Cleveland Booker.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.365
You already know?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.700
Of course I do.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.703
Oh, Tolor.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.458
You know,
when I first took you in as a child,

06:16.167 --> 06:20.963
I was... having complicated feelings
about the death of your father.

06:21.047 --> 06:21.881
Wha--?

06:22.381 --> 06:27.261
You did what you had to do to keep control
of the mercantile exchanges.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.597
I have always understood.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.266
Tolor, I know you did.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.644
You're so much like him.

06:38.856 --> 06:39.982
[creaking]

06:40.691 --> 06:41.943
Auntie?

06:44.612 --> 06:48.282
They'll mesmerize you,
and you won't feel a thing, I promise.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.909
-[gate clanging]
-What?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.412
-No!
-[growling]

06:53.496 --> 06:54.330
[Tolor yelps]

06:55.414 --> 06:56.374
[roaring]

06:58.459 --> 07:01.087
-Aunt Osyraa, no, please.
-Don't be childish.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.506
This is why they call them Tranceworms.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.466
Please, Aunt Osyraa, no!

07:06.134 --> 07:08.928
-[roaring]
-Auntie, no! [yelling]

07:16.185 --> 07:18.187
[theme music playing]

08:46.984 --> 08:50.404
Commander Burnham and Mr. Booker
are preparing for a jump to Kwejian.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.948
What do we have in the meantime?

08:52.031 --> 08:55.493
Mr. Ryn,
a refugee from the salvage planet,

08:55.576 --> 08:57.620
is awake and requesting to speak with you.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.746
Schedule it.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.957
And what about Linus?

09:01.040 --> 09:05.211
Oh. He's been escorted to quarters
and instructed not to return

09:05.294 --> 09:09.257
to the mess hall
until his annual shed is complete.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.968
And where are we on the...

09:13.344 --> 09:14.845
ongoing matter?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.266
So far, we have narrowed it down to--

09:19.725 --> 09:22.895
To "execute," "hit it," and "manifest."

09:23.813 --> 09:25.940
-"Manifest"?
-Nobody likes that one.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.483
"Hit it" was Captain Pike's.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.487
Yeah, but you could put
your own spin on it like "Hit it!"

09:32.863 --> 09:36.200
-I will take it under advisement.
-And Commander Stamets

09:36.284 --> 09:40.121
has requested to report
on their analysis of the Ni'Var data.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.872
He says they have something.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.250
Well, "Hit it, then."

09:44.834 --> 09:46.043
Um...

09:47.003 --> 09:47.837
Right.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.514
[Stamets]
Here. We combined the data from Ni'Var

09:58.598 --> 10:00.891
with the data from
Commander Burnham's black boxes.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.227
This is where the Burn started.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.273
The Verubin Nebula.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.323
Unusually intense radiation,
highly unstable electromagnetic fields.

10:16.032 --> 10:16.866
Okay.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.703
-So we have a point of origin.
-[Adira] There's more.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.874
There's a signal coming
from the center of the nebula.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.044
We weren't sure at first,
but it's deliberate.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.256
Something or someone
is definitely sending it.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.844
The signal frequencies
are in the audio range.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.973
[whirring]

10:43.351 --> 10:45.686
It's been distorted
by magnetic interference,

10:45.770 --> 10:48.314
but, well, it...

10:49.315 --> 10:52.401
It sounds like music.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.237
[music playing]

10:57.615 --> 10:58.449
What?

10:59.158 --> 11:02.411
-I've heard this before.
-The Barzans. On the seed vault ship,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.288
the mother was humming it to her child.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.957
And Gray used to play it on the cello.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.839
That's weird. Scientifically speaking.

11:13.923 --> 11:19.470
The computer has detected a recurrence
of these precise combinations of tones

11:19.553 --> 11:22.932
-since we arrived in the future.
-Just the Nebula, please.

11:28.854 --> 11:29.730
A little louder.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.952
What is the lowest known frequency
traveling through that nebula?

11:43.577 --> 11:49.333
That would be radio wave J.A.G. 380725A,

11:49.417 --> 11:54.380
coming from a nearby neutron star,
at 5.75 kilohertz.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.425
I get it. You wanna model
the effects of the distortion

11:58.008 --> 12:00.428
in order to isolate the original signal.

12:02.930 --> 12:03.764
There.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.267
This is it without the distortion.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.186
That's a Federation distress signal.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.981
There's a ship lost in there.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.734
A distress signal must include
an encoded message of some kind.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.029
Adira can write an algorithm
that can find and decode it.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.866
-How long would that take?
-No more than a few hours.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.284
She's pretty fast.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.411
Update me the moment
you have something, commander.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.495
Of course.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.336
"They" are fast.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.338
[Stamets] Hmm?

12:37.214 --> 12:39.717
"They," not "she."

12:41.719 --> 12:45.931
I've never felt like
a "she" or a "her," so...

12:47.433 --> 12:50.936
I would prefer "they" or "them"
from now on.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.274
Okay.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.158
And I've never told anyone but Gray.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.171
How is it that an hour ago
I didn't know you had a brother?

13:17.254 --> 13:18.589
It's not biological.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.467
"Brother" is something we said, we felt.

13:22.718 --> 13:27.348
But after, well, it became impossible.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.307
After what?

13:28.390 --> 13:31.060
Kyheem started hunting Tranceworms
for the Chain.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.688
-Think you can fix things with him?
-Kwejian is starving.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.399
-He's not my priority.
-Okay.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.028
Hell of a way to bring me home
to meet the family.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.115
First off, you already met Grudge.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.827
Ah. Right.
Yes, and I'm grateful every day.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.454
Well, I just...

13:50.955 --> 13:53.415
I wish you'd seen Kwejian
when it was really beautiful.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.709
It was. It wasn't so...

13:56.585 --> 13:58.754
-complicated.
-I'm gonna like it.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.716
-No, really, it's become something that--
-I am going to like it.

14:03.842 --> 14:04.802
It's your home.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.307
[Owosekun]
Is that a new operating interface?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.685
[Detmer]
I had Engineering make modifications.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.604
The interface is supposed
to modify to you based on your usage.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.273
I need fail-safes.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.109
The only fail-safe
you ever needed was you.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.904
[Saru] Mr. Bryce, are we ready?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.740
Yes, sir. Commander Stamets is ready
to jump to Kwejian on your mark.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.201
-Welcome back to the bridge, Mr. Booker.
-Thank you, captain.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.536
Black alert.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.080
[ship whirs]

14:33.581 --> 14:36.584
And... execute.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.560
[Owosekun]
We've arrived at Kwejian, captain.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.565
[Bryce] I'm trying to hail them, sir,
but I'm getting no response.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.824
Long-range scanners
show a heavy cruiser-class starship

15:08.908 --> 15:11.410
coming in at maximum warp.
Thirty minutes out.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.829
It's the<i> Viridian,</i> Osyraa's ship.

15:14.538 --> 15:18.500
-We don't have a cruiser-class starship.
-Sensors show she's armed to the teeth.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.421
I have no authority over you.
Commander, your orders

15:22.504 --> 15:25.424
are to assess the situation
and see how we may be of service.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.593
But you are to return
to <i>Discovery</i> immediately

15:27.676 --> 15:30.054
-if there is any trouble whatsoever.
-Yes, sir.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.640
Be careful, commander. And good luck.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.808
Thank you.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.399
Dr. Pollard. I trust Dr. Culber
has brought you up to date.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.904
There's a problem in my brain,
ergo, I dressed like a human spermatozoon.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.657
That suit is made
of special hyper-conductive material

15:49.740 --> 15:52.242
to interact with the electromagnetic gel.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.621
There are many jokes to be had here.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.123
If you're gonna torture me,
at least let me have some fun.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.710
-[laughs] This is not torture.
-As if you'd know.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.713
-This is medical advancement.
-I didn't ask.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.633
I'm gonna need you to count backward
for me from ten.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.218
What you need is not im--

16:10.761 --> 16:13.097
-Advancement is good.
-Mm.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.989
[Stamets] That's beautiful.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.827
I didn't know you played so well.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.537
I don't.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.707
I guess I do now. [chuckles]

16:41.291 --> 16:44.628
Kasha is the one who learned to play.
Gray picked it up.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.880
So, now me.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.761
Mm. Gray's not talking to me anymore.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.596
And I don't know why.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.852
I can still feel him,
especially when I play.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.770
That's what's so weird.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.940
He's here...

17:06.400 --> 17:07.317
all the time...

17:09.069 --> 17:11.780
but it feels like he's hiding from me.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.784
Maybe Gray just needs some space?

17:17.870 --> 17:18.704
I know.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.500
It's not just him either.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.086
It's just--

17:26.754 --> 17:28.213
This, all of it--

17:29.923 --> 17:31.425
I am waking up every day

17:31.508 --> 17:33.510
and I never know who I'm gonna feel more.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.639
You know, sometimes it's Kasha,
sometimes Tovar, or Gray,

17:37.723 --> 17:38.849
or sometimes it's just--

17:41.769 --> 17:42.770
Adira?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.735
Well, I'm out here with you.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.822
The algorithm will take
a few more hours at least.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.240
Let's play.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.079
The key is G-minor.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.081
Piece of cake.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.377
[Stamets playing piano]

18:19.264 --> 18:21.892
[Tilly] Commander Burnham and Book
have reached the surface, sir.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.770
How long before we lose the ability
to track their location?

18:24.853 --> 18:27.231
It depends on when they reach
the protected area.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.649
-[door chiming]
-Come.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.944
-Which one of you is the captain?
-[Tilly] Uh-uh.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.905
Try again, this time with the respect
the rank deserves.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.117
May I speak with the captain, please?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.077
I am Captain Saru.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.038
We are meant to meet later,
Mr. Ryn, are we not?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.999
Yes. I appreciate what you've done for me,

18:46.667 --> 18:49.336
but Federation help
always comes with strings.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.880
-No, it doesn't.
-I need to get off this ship.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.925
You are not a prisoner here, Mr. Ryn.
You never have been.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.844
Then beam me down to Kwejian with Book.

18:56.927 --> 19:00.472
You are free to go,
provided the Kwejian accept you.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.225
-However--
-[chuckles] There's always a "however."

19:03.308 --> 19:06.270
There's an Emerald Chain warship
inbound at maximum warp.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.314
Wanna end up on another salvage planet
with an explosive in your neck?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.900
Be our guest. It'll be here in 15 minutes.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.194
Is it... the<i> Viridian?</i>

19:16.405 --> 19:18.574
-Osyraa?
-That is what we believe.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.616
[alarm beeping]

19:21.535 --> 19:23.036
Is that Book?

19:23.120 --> 19:26.456
-What's happening?
-That is Kwejian's defense system.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.876
Anything that enters the protected area

19:28.959 --> 19:31.670
can't be accurately tracked
or transported out.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.088
They're on their own.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.933
My readings are scrambled.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.728
-Welcome to the Sanctuary.
-Yeah.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.232
[sea locusts squeaking]

19:54.026 --> 19:57.321
Michael Burnham,
meet the sea locusts, Kwejian's plague.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.366
If they're this far inland,
means we haven't had repellent for weeks.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.587
How do you make them do that?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.839
All I can do is ask.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.427
You can't ask them
to move back out to sea?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.930
Our best scientists
have been working on it for years.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.057
There are so many.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.809
I know it's complicated...

20:29.061 --> 20:33.065
but I hope you never forget
how beautiful this place is.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.030
I never forget.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.907
-Book?
-Put your hands up.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.533
-Book!
-Do it.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.868
[rustling]

20:53.543 --> 20:55.587
You brought the Federation
with you, Tareckx?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.714
[Booker] I am not Tareckx anymore.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.926
You couldn't face the planet
you abandoned on your own?

21:01.009 --> 21:02.261
I can face anything.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.223
It's you who can't face yourself.
You never could.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.643
Take them.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.354
He's...?

21:13.563 --> 21:14.439
My brother.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.991
[Culber] Her encephalographic readings
are peaking. She's having an episode.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.159
[Pollard]
She's in danger of a cerebral hemorrhage.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.123
Atomic scan 83 percent complete.
We have to abort.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.459
We can't stop. This is the only way
to find out what's wrong with her.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.794
[screaming]

21:36.795 --> 21:38.463
[Pollard] She's close to redline.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.674
[Culber] What the hell?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.932
-[Pollard] Her heart rate is 210!
-[Culber] We're nearly there.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.564
San!

21:55.647 --> 21:57.858
San!

21:57.941 --> 21:58.942
[Pollard] Georgiou?

22:00.444 --> 22:02.029
Philippa? You okay?

22:02.112 --> 22:04.072
Can you tell us what you experienced?

22:06.241 --> 22:10.662
I was having a beautiful dream
about how your head would look on my wall.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.462
I am Kyheem, Steward of the Sanctuary.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.589
[Booker] Oh, some job you're doing.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.383
Looks like the price of Tranceworm meat
has hit a new high.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.970
I'm Commander Michael Burnham
of the starship <i>Discovery.</i>

22:27.054 --> 22:29.056
-Tareckx didn't mention--
-Book.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.352
-Book.
-I stopped being a Tareckx

22:34.436 --> 22:36.688
when Father and Grandfather
started working with the Chain.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.732
They both asked for you
on their deathbeds.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.526
You're a man of character...
or you aren't.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.612
Maybe they remembered that in the end.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.491
-Oh. So righteous.
-Someone has to be.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.705
-What are the Federation's intentions?
-Observation and support.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.293
Kwejian is a sovereign planet.
We don't need another savior. You can go.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.879
She stays. You called, I showed up.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.673
-What's going on?
-A criminal.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.760
Ryn. Osyraa wants him.

23:09.137 --> 23:12.474
Never thought you'd dance at the end
of their chain, but here you are.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.060
You saw how far the locusts are inland.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.355
I did.
But I won't return someone to slavery.

23:18.438 --> 23:21.233
Without Osyraa,
there'd be nothing left here.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.984
I see there's nothing left of you.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.987
Says the nomad who rejects his name
and everything he is.

23:26.071 --> 23:26.905
Well...

23:28.740 --> 23:32.369
I did manage to hold on
to a few core principles.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.251
[Owosekun] The <i>Viridian's</i> arrived.

23:39.334 --> 23:42.546
Osyraa's scanning us, but she isn't
blocking our scans in return.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.258
She wants us to see her
and all her firepower.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.843
-Yellow alert, sir?
-[Saru] No.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.928
Full diplomatic protocols.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.389
No actions that might be
misinterpreted as a provocation.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.849
-[comm chiming]
-We're being hailed.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.768
Can you get a message to Burnham
through the Kwejian defenses?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.228
I can try, sir.

23:58.311 --> 24:01.815
Tell her to leave the protected area
and transport back to <i>Discovery</i>.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.275
-Yes, sir.
-Put Osyraa through.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.159
<i>Well,</i>

24:12.742 --> 24:15.996
<i>it's been a while</i>
<i>since we've seen a Starfleet vessel.</i>

24:16.079 --> 24:17.038
<i>Are you lost?</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:20.041
I am Captain Saru of the <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:25.130
We are an observational presence here
at the request of the citizens of Kwejian.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.549
<i>I see. But I'm afraid you can't operate</i>

24:27.632 --> 24:29.676
<i>under the observational umbrella</i>

24:29.759 --> 24:32.387
<i>while you're harboring</i>
<i>a wanted criminal named Ryn.</i>

24:35.682 --> 24:36.766
Wanted by whom?

24:36.850 --> 24:40.437
To our knowledge, no entity
recognized by the Federation

24:40.520 --> 24:43.106
desires Mr. Ryn's capture.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.276
<i>"Recognized by the Federation"? Hmm.</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:50.447
<i>Out here,</i>
<i>we don't bend to that kind of hubris.</i>

24:51.615 --> 24:53.491
<i>Prepare to transport him to my vessel.</i>

24:53.575 --> 24:55.118
Scared of the monster you serve.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.079
I knew you, Kyheem.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.373
-You never knew me.
-You weren't afraid of anything.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.876
You have to give up Ryn.

25:02.959 --> 25:08.006
If Mr. Ryn has committed serious crimes,
the Federation will hold him accountable.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.009
<i>The Federation</i>
<i>can't even hold itself accountable</i>

25:11.092 --> 25:13.970
<i>for the mess it's made</i>
<i>or the blood on its hands.</i>

25:14.054 --> 25:16.848
<i>Send the prisoner to me, now.</i>

25:16.932 --> 25:19.351
Give up the Tranceworms.
Poison the locusts.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.728
Give up Ryn.
What happens when they come for you?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.396
Who's gonna stand for you?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.774
We are your people.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.694
-We are your family.
-Act like it!

25:29.778 --> 25:30.737
[groans]

25:37.452 --> 25:38.536
You.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.414
You are the coward.

25:43.625 --> 25:48.546
The Andorian you seek is here
under security protocol 49.09.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.841
<i>He signed a life-long contract,</i>
<i>he's broken the contract.</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:54.803
That sounds suspiciously like slavery.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.848
[scoffs]<i> It doesn't surprise me</i>
<i>that a Kelpien would frame everything</i>

25:58.932 --> 26:00.558
<i>in terms of enslavement.</i>

26:00.642 --> 26:04.729
If memory serves, the Orions
were once enslaved themselves.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.817
<i>My ancestors knew that power is virtue</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:11.236
<i>and there is no nobility in suffering.</i>

26:11.319 --> 26:13.863
<i>You do what it takes</i>
<i>to get what you need or you don't.</i>

26:13.947 --> 26:16.032
<i>I want Ryn. You have him.</i>

26:16.116 --> 26:19.077
<i>And the Federation does not want</i>
<i>a war with the Emerald Chain,</i>

26:19.160 --> 26:22.998
<i>that's why you came alone.</i>
<i>That's why you are just observing.</i>

26:23.790 --> 26:25.667
<i>Transport Ryn to my ship,</i>

26:26.376 --> 26:31.131
<i>or the Kwejian and any of your crew</i>
<i>on its surface will pay his price.</i>

26:34.551 --> 26:35.885
<i>I'll grant you five minutes.</i>

26:38.596 --> 26:40.849
-Mr. Bryce?
-Unable to reach Commander Burnham.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.351
Osyraa just dropped into the atmosphere,
weapons hot.

26:45.186 --> 26:47.564
Yellow alert. Keep trying, Mr. Bryce.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.609
-Bring Mr. Ryn to the bridge immediately.
-Yes, sir.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.779
[comm chimes]

27:04.289 --> 27:05.123
Yes?

27:09.252 --> 27:12.422
Is that Kwejian whiskey?
I could use a shot myself.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.843
I have to say this defense system
of yours is impressive.

27:17.427 --> 27:18.720
According to my sensors,

27:18.803 --> 27:23.350
you're bouncing my signal to eight places
even as I talk to you right now.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.894
Did you get blown to bits
and forget to tell me?

27:26.644 --> 27:27.562
I brought Book.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.190
I have kept my end of the bargain.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.778
That was before he showed up with
a Federation ship that has Ryn on board.

27:35.570 --> 27:39.407
Now, they're not playing nicely,
so I'm going to need Book

27:39.491 --> 27:40.992
and whoever he came with.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.453
So, you can what?

27:44.537 --> 27:47.582
When have you ever dared to question me?

27:50.210 --> 27:52.003
Is this your brother working on you?

27:53.963 --> 27:56.758
Look, if you don't wanna be the one
who turns him over, that's fine.

27:56.841 --> 27:59.636
Turn off your defense system,
and I'll come and get him.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.472
It's the right thing for Kwejian.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.517
I can't.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.685
All right, then.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.687
Famine.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.357
You have a child.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.401
Am I right?

28:15.276 --> 28:17.821
Have you ever seen a child starve?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.865
Is your brother really worth it?

28:21.741 --> 28:25.328
The locusts have started
to destroy Kwejian's harvest.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.122
People are already suffering.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.670
Okay, let's try this another way.

28:41.719 --> 28:45.807
I don't have a lot of time to waste,
so bring your brother to me now.

28:45.890 --> 28:50.228
I will burn ten hecapates of forest
every minute of delay.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.485
Photon torpedoes.

28:58.528 --> 28:59.362
Osyraa.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.614
Let's go.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.451
-[Burnham] She's targeting the defenses.
-[Booker] I know the way.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.342
[Saru]<i> Status report?</i>

29:21.426 --> 29:22.969
[Bryce] No word from Commander Burnham.

29:23.052 --> 29:27.182
Osyraa is carpet-bombing systematically,
firing in a grid for maximum damage.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.768
[Owosekun]
Kwejian's defenses are starting to fail.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.645
Mr. Ryn, why are you
so important to Osyraa?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.689
She's destroying the planet
looking for you.

29:34.773 --> 29:39.027
-Commander Burnham and Book are there.
-[Saru] We need to know what she wants.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.528
We can't engage with her blindly.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.906
I can't.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.784
I'm sorry.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.412
Mr. Rhys, take weapons online.

29:49.496 --> 29:53.583
-But, sir, Admiral Vance said--
-I am well aware of his instructions.

29:53.666 --> 29:57.295
We are continuing to retrieve
Commander Burnham and Mr. Booker

29:57.378 --> 30:01.716
as Starfleet protocol demands,
but we will prevent Osyraa

30:01.800 --> 30:05.678
from committing atrocities
as Starfleet protocol also demands.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.973
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Bryce, open a ship-wide channel.

30:14.145 --> 30:20.276
Computer, override security encryption
authorization code QLR854548.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.743
[Saru over PA]<i> All crew to stations,</i>
<i>we are going to red alert.</i>

30:28.827 --> 30:30.912
[alarm wailing]

30:30.995 --> 30:31.830
Michael.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.917
I don't need a scan
to know where you're headed.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.126
Out of my way.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.880
You were a liability to her on the
salvage planet, you almost got her killed.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.257
Stand down.

30:44.050 --> 30:44.884
I'm dying.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.388
It's not that cut-and-dry.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.642
Let's find a quieter place to talk.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.229
Fine.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.731
[Burnham]
Burnham to <i>Discovery,</i> do you copy?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.900
Osyraa's targeting
Kwejian's defense systems.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.903
One is down,
we're gonna attempt to repair it.

31:07.907 --> 31:08.783
This way!

31:08.867 --> 31:12.287
If you can hear this message,
we need any help we can get.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.081
We can't let Osyraa get a lock
on everyone here!

31:15.164 --> 31:16.833
-How much further?
-Almost there!

31:17.792 --> 31:19.502
[Rhys] I still can't reach
Commander Burnham.

31:19.586 --> 31:22.714
Five minutes at most
until Osyraa is able to break through.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.049
Have scanners picked up
any weaknesses in her shields?

31:25.133 --> 31:27.802
-None that I can find, sir.
-I know where they are.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.389
I climbed over every class of ship
on salvage duty.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.433
[Saru] And you're willing to help us?

31:34.726 --> 31:35.935
For Book's sake.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.104
I owe him.

31:38.187 --> 31:42.108
Sir, if we return fire, Osyraa will see it
as an attack from the Federation.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.444
Emerald Chain
will retaliate against everyone.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.446
At this point,
we have no choice, lieutenant.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.158
What if we fired on her
from a non-Federation starship?

31:50.783 --> 31:51.910
Another ship?

31:51.993 --> 31:55.622
Flown by a Starfleet pilot
who will be disciplined severely

31:55.705 --> 31:58.333
for disobeying orders and for going rogue.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.811
-[Detmer] What's my target?
-Where the gunwale meets the aft nacelles.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.738
Sensors aren't showing damage.
Am I hitting this thing or what?

32:29.030 --> 32:32.200
Trust me, you've weakened the shield.
Just keep the pressure on.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.534
-Go back and--
-[meows]

32:33.618 --> 32:35.078
-[Ryn gasps]
-[cat meows]

32:35.161 --> 32:38.414
[gasps] What is this?
What's that noise it's making?

32:38.498 --> 32:40.833
-It's a cat.
-What is that? Like a pet?

32:42.669 --> 32:45.546
-Shields down to 80 percent.
-Sure you're up for this?

32:57.558 --> 32:58.893
Wait, is that my ship?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.567
[hunter] Kyheem wants you back.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.017
[computer]<i> Shields at 10 percent.</i>

33:39.100 --> 33:40.643
-You have to go back.
-No.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.145
Burnham's not clear yet.

33:42.228 --> 33:45.648
Last time I tried to stand up to Osyraa,
I lost my antenna.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.650
This time, I'll get vaporized.

33:55.950 --> 33:58.077
You're the only one
who's ever stood up to her, correct?

33:58.870 --> 34:00.705
-How'd you know that?
-I didn't.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.123
I guessed.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.669
But for what it's worth,
I have the right co-pilot.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.008
If you face something, you can beat it,

34:12.091 --> 34:15.386
and that is exactly
what we're gonna do right now.

34:18.139 --> 34:21.309
I just need you to be brave
for a few more minutes. You with me?

34:22.560 --> 34:23.394
Yeah.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.815
Good. 'Cause I'm about to do something
that might get us both killed.

34:27.899 --> 34:32.570
Computer, suspend automatic controls.
Full manual control.

34:35.531 --> 34:38.076
-What are you doing?
-This is how I learned to fly.

34:43.664 --> 34:44.499
[Burnham] Kyheem?

34:54.550 --> 34:55.551
Book, stop!

34:57.220 --> 34:58.971
-Osyraa will kill us all!
-Us?

34:59.055 --> 35:00.431
There is no us anymore!

35:00.515 --> 35:02.183
You saw to that!

35:13.111 --> 35:14.779
-Enough!
-Michael!

35:14.862 --> 35:15.822
Let him go.

35:16.572 --> 35:20.118
<i>Discovery</i> won't give up Ryn,
so she'll take me as leverage.

35:21.035 --> 35:24.247
-That is never gonna happen.
-Kyheem.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.583
You knew this was a possibility
the moment you agreed to find me.

35:41.097 --> 35:41.931
Book.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.895
If this is what it takes...

35:50.189 --> 35:53.234
send me up to her.
Maybe she'll give you a bonus.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.913
Come on!

36:12.003 --> 36:12.962
[grunts]

36:16.924 --> 36:18.718
[explosions]

36:30.104 --> 36:31.272
Whoo!

36:31.856 --> 36:33.024
-You okay?
-Uh-huh.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.650
We're going again.

36:45.953 --> 36:50.166
All right. Eight degrees aft.
Straight down. Weapons system generator.

37:05.514 --> 37:08.726
-[Tilly] The<i> Viridian</i> is standing down.
-Incoming transmission.

37:08.809 --> 37:09.977
Put it through.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.817
Osyraa, your ship appears
to have sustained structural damage.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.819
Allow us to be of assistance.

37:18.903 --> 37:22.907
<i>You have just sealed your own fate</i>
<i>and the fate of the Federation.</i>

37:24.450 --> 37:27.536
<i>I promise you will feel</i>
<i>the full weight of the Chain.</i>

37:37.922 --> 37:39.215
We are gonna starve.

37:41.050 --> 37:41.884
My son.

37:43.678 --> 37:44.512
You have a son?

37:51.602 --> 37:52.561
[sighs]

37:58.484 --> 37:59.318
Look.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.321
You both are empaths.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.742
Why can't you move the sea locusts
out to sea together?

38:07.827 --> 38:08.661
It's too many.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.164
Even with two of us.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.712
Who said anything about
just the two of you?

38:20.339 --> 38:23.634
We've isolated the electromagnetic
connection between the sea locusts.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.137
We'll amplify it, same as on Kaminar.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.556
Just tell them where to go.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.142
-It's their choice, not ours.
-<i>I know.</i>

38:48.659 --> 38:53.539
[in alien language]
Sacred within me, sacred beyond me,

38:53.622 --> 38:55.833
be in harmony with me.

38:55.916 --> 39:00.004
<i>Sacred within me, sacred beyond me,</i>

39:00.087 --> 39:02.214
be in harmony with me.

39:02.840 --> 39:07.345
Sacred with me, sacred beyond me,

39:07.428 --> 39:09.472
be in harmony with me.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.856
Need to boost the signal
and the brothers should get them home.

39:19.482 --> 39:22.318
Captain, shall I execute?

39:23.110 --> 39:23.944
Carry on.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.199
[chuckles]

39:28.282 --> 39:29.450
Amplifying now.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.541
[Booker and Kyheem
continue in alien language]

39:52.014 --> 39:55.309
The locusts are communicating.
They're getting the message.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.644
Go.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.567
[both continue speaking in alien language]

40:14.537 --> 40:17.123
[Burnham] <i>You did it! Well done.</i>

40:18.374 --> 40:19.208
<i>Both of you.</i>

40:23.295 --> 40:26.549
Oh, it was great! I went full manual.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.008
-No.
-You did not.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.927
Oh, hell, yeah, I did. Ask Ryn.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.305
You gonna be all macho
and impossible all week?

40:33.389 --> 40:35.641
[Detmer]
That's right. Deal with me, universe!

40:35.724 --> 40:38.561
[Owosekun] Deal with me, universe,
while I deal with her.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.063
[Detmer] Took a sec for Ryn to chill out.

40:41.147 --> 40:45.818
Once he got Grudge in order, he told me
where to aim, and it was... boom.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.945
I'm as valuable as the cat.

40:48.028 --> 40:52.074
Oh. Knock it off with the whole
"sad Andorian" thing. You're a hero.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.702
She'll be back. Osyraa.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.122
And it will be bad next time.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.666
Well, we can be pretty bad, too, so...

41:00.749 --> 41:01.584
[chuckles]

41:04.587 --> 41:05.421
You know...

41:06.338 --> 41:10.593
all I heard about when I was little
was how deceitful the Federation was.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.386
How they'd turn on you.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.722
You want to scare an Andorian child,

41:14.805 --> 41:17.057
tell them they're going
to Federation summer camp.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.143
That's not a thing.

41:23.856 --> 41:27.610
I need to tell you something.
Something that will give you an advantage.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.155
They're running out of dilithium.
The Chain.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.782
That's why Osyraa wants me back.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.285
I'm the only one who knows.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.954
And now you do, too.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.461
[giggles] Lizard.

41:45.544 --> 41:47.213
So, this is home now?

41:48.422 --> 41:51.133
-No. Kwejian is home.
-[chuckles]

41:52.134 --> 41:53.761
Feels good to hear you say that.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.181
This is where they're making
a difference for planets like Kwejian.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.558
I like being around that.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.146
Kyheem, do you mind if Lito comes with me?

42:04.230 --> 42:06.524
Oh, no, please. Go on.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.318
I'm gonna show you something amazing.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.820
-The lizard guy?
-Mm-hm.

42:11.904 --> 42:15.366
His name is Linus and you can peel off
a part of his face if you want.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.159
Ew. Fun.

42:21.121 --> 42:22.790
So, Book.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.126
Don't even. It sounds stupid
coming out your mouth.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.504
Oh. [chuckles] I'm why it sounds stupid?

42:28.587 --> 42:29.588
[laughs]

42:30.130 --> 42:31.173
There's a story.

42:32.591 --> 42:34.176
Are you gonna tell me about it?

42:35.678 --> 42:36.887
How about next time?

42:37.888 --> 42:39.974
If it's sooner than 15 years, yeah.

42:40.057 --> 42:40.891
[chuckles]

42:42.476 --> 42:45.020
Thank you. You held everything together.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.147
You saved Kwejian.

42:50.901 --> 42:54.238
So, the Federation,
it seems they can use...

42:55.155 --> 42:57.324
empathic perspective, yes?

42:57.408 --> 43:00.411
-Yeah. They can.
-Don't say "brother."

43:01.579 --> 43:04.331
-It's corny.
-I wasn't going to. [chuckles]

43:19.054 --> 43:19.972
Later, brother.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.227
Burning the midnight oil?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.605
Yeah, just wrapping up.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.983
Nothing more to do
until their algorithm finishes.

43:31.066 --> 43:32.318
No. Let them sleep.

43:33.193 --> 43:35.195
At that age,
whatever they can get is golden.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.911
Gray stopped speaking to them.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.081
-Ouch.
-Yeah.

43:47.541 --> 43:52.546
But even so, their work
has been nothing short of stellar.

43:53.714 --> 43:54.548
They're...

43:55.716 --> 43:58.594
-really something.
-They're also awake.

43:58.677 --> 43:59.511
[chuckles]

44:00.012 --> 44:01.680
I'm sorry.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.349
No, it's okay.

44:04.016 --> 44:06.477
When I sleep like this, my back kills.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.520
Well, you've gotta take
better care of yourself.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.982
No need to fuss over them, Hugh.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.693
-They're not a child.
-Technically, they are a child.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.615
-Are we done for today?
-We are.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.575
Okay.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.666
-Later, gents.
-[Culber] Good night.

44:36.131 --> 44:39.176
Pride. It suits you.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.929
Is that your professional opinion?

44:42.554 --> 44:43.806
Board-certified.

44:46.725 --> 44:49.520
Your nephew is hilarious. [chuckles]

44:50.187 --> 44:52.272
-Runs in the family.
-Mm-hm.

44:53.482 --> 44:56.193
My ship looks like it was hit
with a dozen photon torpedoes.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.444
Actually, it was eight.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.572
-Oh, good.
-[chuckles]

45:02.366 --> 45:04.076
Did you mean what you said to Kyheem?

45:05.869 --> 45:07.454
You get what we're doing out here?

45:08.580 --> 45:11.917
<i>Discovery</i> saved my planet
from something that had us for a century.

45:13.794 --> 45:14.753
What you've done...

45:16.255 --> 45:20.175
what the Federation's done,
for us, for other worlds like ours...

45:22.428 --> 45:23.262
I want in.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.641
I want what means something.

45:33.564 --> 45:36.358
Well, you'll have to speak to Captain Saru

45:36.442 --> 45:39.278
and clarify your intentions
aboard his starship.

45:39.361 --> 45:41.655
-Aye, aye. One "aye," yeah.
-One "aye."

45:41.738 --> 45:42.698
I know.

45:46.743 --> 45:48.787
I'll get started fixing your ship.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.086
I really liked seeing Kwejian.

45:56.795 --> 45:58.797
I really liked being there with you.

46:02.259 --> 46:04.261
[woman speaking over PA indistinctly]

46:13.353 --> 46:15.355
