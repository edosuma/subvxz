Radio Corporation of America,

00:56.515 --> 00:58.599
semi-conductors and materials diνision.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.476
Sounds like a hell of a stock portfolio.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.145
It's everyone who's building a rocket.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.897
Do you know, if we stay in Beverly Hills,

01:04.982 --> 01:06.566
even though the convention's
in Santa Monica,

01:06.650 --> 01:07.900
we'll be halfway to Pasadena.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.610
Pasadena?

01:09.695 --> 01:11.154
Isn't it just people with T.B.?

01:11.238 --> 01:14.657
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
and Ray Bradbury.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.159
As much as I'd like to indulge

01:16.243 --> 01:18.911
your Twilight Zone fantasy
of being shot into space--

01:18.996 --> 01:21.998
Believe me, it's our fantasy, too.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.541
This is a business trip.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.251
I don't want either of you coming back tan.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.711
What if I have to play golf?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.546
As long as you lose.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.466
Crab Colson guarantees there will be
some astronauts there.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.385
Really? My nephews
would love an autograph.

01:34.470 --> 01:38.264
Astronauts love golf.
I'll see what I can do.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.391
You're there to sell,
but you're also there to listen.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.894
Every scientist, engineer,
and general is trying

01:42.978 --> 01:44.812
to figure out a way
to put a man on the moon

01:44.897 --> 01:48.191
or blow up Moscow,
whichever one costs more.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.527
We haνe to explain to them
how we can help them spend that money.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.155
Well, it certainly would
behoove us to find out--

01:54.239 --> 01:56.783
Campbell, you do the talking.
Kinsey, you do the listening.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.120
Don, you wanted me to remind them
about the congressmen.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.748
We know.
They control the purse strings.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.001
No. They are the customer.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.506
They want aerospace in their districts.

02:11.590 --> 02:15.843
Let them know that we can help them
bring these contracts home.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.641
Did you read anything that she prepared?

02:24.937 --> 02:26.395
Maybe I should send her.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.493
You know I'll stay out of your way.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.994
Of course.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.747
Lounging at the pool.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.208
They'll think you're
a young Barbara Stanwyck.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.627
Doesn't that sound like fun?

02:49.711 --> 02:54.048
If you're there, it will make me look
less serious in the office.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.050
Next time.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.094
It's a week, Tweety.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.346
l suppose I can go to
my parents' place in Rehoboth.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.099
Now you're making me feel bad.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.600
Is that the only alternative?

03:04.685 --> 03:07.103
They keep asking to spend time with me.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.980
Well, us.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.441
They're concerned.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.402
About what?

03:15.571 --> 03:17.280
Nothing's happening.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.742
Why do you insist on making me
angry before I go to bed?

03:21.827 --> 03:25.121
There are some very reputable agencies.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.664
We can't even talk about this?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.332
Do l haνe to put my foot down?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.084
What's wrong with it?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.253
It's someone else's child.

03:34.590 --> 03:39.135
Once you see a beautiful little baby,
you'll fall in loνe.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.261
You know you will.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.846
It's not natural.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.639
I felt that way.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.850
But it changed.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.645
We would have our pick.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.355
We are ideal candidates.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.649
We have means,
and we've been to doctors,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.903
so it's on the record that it's something
we'νe been wanting for a long time.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.412
Do your parents just think
I say no to eνerything?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.751
We're not related by blood,
and you love me.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.139
Hello.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.891
It's me.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.894
What time is it?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.854
It's 1 0:00. Are you sleeping?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.731
No.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.317
William called.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.027
My father had a stroke.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.448
Jesus.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.951
Three days ago.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.870
Gloria didn't eνen call me.
She had William call.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.121
Is it bad?

04:50.374 --> 04:53.417
She said he's up and around, talking,

04:53.502 --> 04:55.294
but she wouldn't put him on the phone.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.755
I'm coming to get you.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.256
No.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.508
Bets, it's not up for discussion.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.884
Take the kids to Francine.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.679
I don't want to wake them.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.555
Fine.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.057
I'll be by in the morning.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.934
God.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.229
You know, I've been
dreaming about a suitcase?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.815
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.151
Sure.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.569
Everything's perfect.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.864
I'll be by at 8.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.201
Bye-bye.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.583
Hello, Betty.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.252
Hello, Gloria.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.336
Hello, Don.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.173
Look at the two of you.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.637
I swear to you,
the doctors say it's not serious.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.932
We can get a room down the road
at the William Penn.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.518
Nonsense.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.520
Where is he? Can I see him?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.105
He's getting dressed.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.858
They said he should do things on his own.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.026
Come sit.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.906
Don't do that.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.992
We're supposed to keep it dim.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.702
I don't know why.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.913
Let me check on him.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.625
William. I wasn't expecting you.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.878
- Good morning.
- Look who's here.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.717
He doesn't seem that bad.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.844
Don, good to see you.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.345
Sorry about your dad.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.930
We'll get by, right?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.182
Judy's coming later.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.600
She's dropping the girls off at her mother's.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.395
Gloria, everything is copasetic.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.730
It'll be nice to see her.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.405
It's an angel.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.157
Hi, Daddy.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.035
That's what I needed.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.119
Hello, Don.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.081
Get that look off your face.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.665
Good to see you, Gene.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.543
I'll take a visit from you two
any way I can get it.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.922
Where are the munchkins?

07:03.006 --> 07:05.216
With a neighbor.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.385
Pop, did you see Don's car?

07:08.470 --> 07:10.096
You finally step up to a Lincoln?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.639
Coupe De Ville.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.974
Ice-blue, white top.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.060
Very nice.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.937
How you feeling, Daddy?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.731
It's a tempest in a teapot.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.650
You should've seen her in the ambulance.

07:22.734 --> 07:28.072
Well, we were halfway to the hospital
before l noticed I was in my nightie.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.783
A woman my age should not travel that way.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.910
I wish you'd called earlier.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.663
The other partners at Don's firm
know all kinds of doctors.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.958
In New York, right,
where everything's better.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.547
Always with her brow in a knit,
my Ruthie here.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.883
Ruthie, my love, have you offered
eνerybody coffee?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.428
I'm Betty.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.889
Of course you are.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.724
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.477
It's not Ruth. Ruth is dead.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.982
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.781
Don, you were able to get off work?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.575
I'm here.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.036
- You want a drink?
- I'll get some ice.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.457
What did the doctors say?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.918
It's just like last time.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.670
What?

08:24.754 --> 08:26.922
Last time? This happened before?

08:27.007 --> 08:31.093
Don't get mad at her.
It's a couple little strokes.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.511
Runs in the family.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.138
You know Gene.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.640
Always has to be the one
taking care of things.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.022
So, Don, how did you come?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.773
Did you take the Turnpike?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.860
Yes.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.208
Look at this. It's my lunch date.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.837
Hello, baby. You're early.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.089
You remember Ken and Pete?

09:09.174 --> 09:11.050
Hello, Sheila.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.094
Want to get in a few more meals
before you lose him to the Golden West?

09:14.179 --> 09:16.347
What are you talking about?

09:16.431 --> 09:17.806
We're going to Los Angeles together.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.767
It's horrible, but somebody has to go.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.269
Where?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.437
Californ-I-A.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.314
Thank you, Pete.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.233
Come on, Campbell.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.485
Time to put something else in that mouth.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.611
Nice to see you.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.865
I was going to tell you at lunch.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.910
Why are you going to Los Angeles?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.828
Come on. Not here.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.169
It just came up.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.712
The election's not for months.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.047
We can register voters in October.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.674
It has nothing to do with the election.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.758
You know that.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.593
If you don't mind,

09:54.678 --> 09:58.097
I'd rather face Mississippi
and those people screaming at me

09:58.181 --> 10:01.058
and maybe getting shot
after I go to California.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.601
Are you scared?

10:02.686 --> 10:05.271
Don't pretend like it's not scary.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.440
Look, I haνe to go.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.234
Why? What is so important?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.945
It's a convention.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.114
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.541
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.668
Please, Hollis. It's Paul.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.837
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.255
Nice to meet you.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.723
Did you eνer really plan
on going down South?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.225
How could you ask that?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.185
This just came up.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.358
You can always get another
job at a grocery store.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.695
I can't just walk into an ad agency.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.031
I can't belieνe you.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.743
AIl you do is complain about
that place and those people.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.994
That's not true.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.412
Well, I'm going.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.082
I guess I'll just hop in Billy Kaplan's bus
with ten strangers.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.418
Why can't it wait?

11:13.214 --> 11:14.423
1 9th Street.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.677
This was all supposed to be ours.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.055
I keep thinking what would haνe
happened if Dad had lived.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.682
He'd be on his knees to us.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.144
What about all that money
Dad gaνe to Lincoln Center?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.604
Get that back.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.065
You can't take a donation back.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.193
Listen, I'm as upset as you are.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.528
We're about to finally buy in Millbrook.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.365
How long can she afford to live?

11:39.449 --> 11:42.493
By golly, Pete, maybe we can
get rid of her tonight.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.703
Remember Rope?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.625
Well, look, all we have to do

11:49.709 --> 11:51.794
is go over there, get her signature,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.546
mourn over the loss
of our birthright, and move on.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.632
I hate going there.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.008
The smell.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.427
To the end of the line.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.268
Does Judy want kids?

12:08.353 --> 12:10.229
We have a five-year plan.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.855
Although secretly I think Judy hopes

12:11.940 --> 12:14.108
we're that childless couple
people invite oνer.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.778
Trudy?

12:18.780 --> 12:20.155
We've tried.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.075
That must be disappointing.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.789
Adoption.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.834
People do that.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.586
They do.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.927
So, the Yankees are having a hell of a year.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.054
Do you take Bobby?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.472
All the time.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.350
We really thought you were going
to make it to Cape May.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.645
Although without Betty there,
everyone had a turn at winning.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.981
Elizabeth's got a mind for cards.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.495
Where were you?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.124
I was hiding in the tree house.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.042
It's like a tomb in there.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.836
I don't know how Don's standing it.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.006
Is this the last picture of her in the house?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.382
I don't know.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.343
And where's the ottoman with the birds?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.138
I don't know, Betty.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.848
I mean, can you blame her?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.766
I wouldn't want to live with Mom's ghost.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.561
She's a silly woman.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.313
All that talk about her underthings.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.650
Daddy used to fine us
for smaIl talk, remember?

13:38.735 --> 13:41.695
Conversation is an art.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.156
Well, it is.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.496
How long has he been like this?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.458
He was acting queer
on the golf course last month.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.835
Let one of the colored caddies
really have it.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.339
Look, Gloria's helping us.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.007
Okay? I don't want to get stuck with him

14:02.091 --> 14:04.259
just because l cared enough
not to moνe away.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.929
Don works in Manhattan.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.723
You know I wish I could be here.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.016
You only have two kids.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.935
Lord knows Don could afford
to build him a house

14:13.019 --> 14:14.603
in his backyard if he wanted to.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.022
Stop counting other people's money.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.777
And the jardinière.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.695
The what?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.405
It used to be right there.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.533
The ceramic thing?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.538
I think we have that.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.999
Do l haνe to go around and write my name
on all the things that I want?

14:36.084 --> 14:38.544
Bets, you're drunk.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.421
Well, I hope eνerybody's hungry.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.549
We're minutes away.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.551
Why is that window open?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.477
Well, look at that. You found a corner.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.646
You're pulling your end.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.274
Can't say the same about him.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.733
Don's helping.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.070
Who know what he does, why he does it?

15:05.154 --> 15:08.031
I know more about the kid
who fixes my damn car.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.659
Dad, you're hurting Don's feelings.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.120
It's okay.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.873
Nobody has what you have.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.209
You act like it's nothing.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.295
My daughter's a princess.
You know that?

15:21.379 --> 15:24.298
Dinnertime.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.969
What's going on?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.346
He has no people!

15:31.431 --> 15:33.181
You can't trust a person like that!

15:33.266 --> 15:34.433
Daddy.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.983
Fine. Let's go eat.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.288
Come on.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.665
I have no appetite.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.208
Birdie, you should eat.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.752
Stop it, Don.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.629
Nobody's watching.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.434
And here, Mother.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.561
How many of these are there?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.022
Hello, all.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.608
I brought my pen.
Hope l didn't miss anything.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.402
Other than dinner, no.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.987
Hello, Mother.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.744
I think it's nice that even though
you let Bud do all the work,

16:35.828 --> 16:38.205
you found time to grace us
with your signature.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.916
Yes, well, anything I can do.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.670
I just hope you don't get too used to this.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.380
To what?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.715
This family.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.926
It has come to my attention
that you and Trudy

16:51.010 --> 16:53.220
are considering a child that's not your own.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.930
Is this true?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.350
It just came up.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.268
How is that possible?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.980
Peter, I would hate
to have to exclude you

17:04.065 --> 17:06.066
from what is rightfully yours.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.651
You have to keep at it.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.904
You know what, Mother?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.532
This is not a topic of conversation.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.743
I think you know how your father felt
about the whole idea.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.163
It's suitable for some.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.874
But really, you're pulling from the discards.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.627
My father?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.546
- Yes.
- Pete.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.467
Your husband spent everything you had.

17:34.429 --> 17:37.139
Spent it with strangers.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.682
All of it.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.809
What are you talking about?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.437
I'll messenger these
to your office tomorrow.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.647
That's a swell idea.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.442
The tone of your voice-- I don't like it.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.986
That, too?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.572
Stop being dramatic.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.701
Bud, what is my fiduciary state?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.828
Tell her.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.958
Well...

18:05.084 --> 18:08.336
We had to liquidate your holdings
to ensure your future comfort.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.713
Why?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.339
Who asked you to do that?

18:11.424 --> 18:14.009
The market took a turn for the worse.

18:15.678 --> 18:16.678
Real estate?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.430
I think I would haνe heard about that.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.602
Yes, well, don't forget
to send those by my office.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.120
Do you want me to
lay everything out for you?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.831
It's been a day.
I just want to go to sleep.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.736
You're smoking like a chimney.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.446
It giνes you wrinkles, you know.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.909
Good morning, eνeryone.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.160
Gene.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.787
Morning, Don.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.333
I have some batter left.
Would you like some waffles?

21:33.417 --> 21:35.669
No. This will be fine.

21:35.753 --> 21:38.046
And coffee.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.881
- Morning, eνerybody.
- Do you want breakfast?

21:39.966 --> 21:40.924
No.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.927
I had no idea.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.388
Please, Judy, it's okay.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.223
No, it's yours. I feel terrible.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.393
I didn't know your mother promised it to you.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.644
Really, Judy, it's okay.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.312
I wish he hadn't brought it up with you.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.647
I'm putting it over here.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.985
Isn't Viola coming today?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.194
Later.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.072
There's no chance she'll miss you.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.157
- Leave the dishes.
- Nonsense.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.576
You look beautiful.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.619
Thank you.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.414
Now that you've fed me,
why don't we go upstairs?

22:12.498 --> 22:14.124
Gene!

22:14.208 --> 22:16.751
I'm fine.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.212
I don't know what to say.
He's so mixed up.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.338
Gene, you are mixed up.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.840
You're mixed up.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.678
He's tired. He didn't sleep last night.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.471
Of course.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.353
Dad, you have to go back to the doctor.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.522
I already haνe an appointment for Monday.

22:43.362 --> 22:47.907
So...Daddy, what would you
like to do today?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.492
Finish that puzzle?

22:49.577 --> 22:51.745
Sure.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.122
And maybe drive into town.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.957
Get you a milkshake.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.376
That's a grand idea.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.603
Come in.

23:19.023 --> 23:20.315
Finally.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.859
I told her to call you.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.611
You should have called me.

23:24.695 --> 23:25.737
Hello, Viola.

23:28.199 --> 23:31.326
And you two look good, considering.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.535
How are the children?

23:32.620 --> 23:33.787
They're good.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.499
I'm gonna make some calls.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.754
You should be here every day.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.631
That's not up to me.

23:44.715 --> 23:48.343
Why not?
You've been here longer than her.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.011
He needs you.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.596
I don't know about that.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.308
And you let Gloria and Judy
ransack the house.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.769
You want to giνe me your temper?

24:07.613 --> 24:10.198
He doesn't know who I am.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.534
He's very, very sick.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.041
You don't know how nice it is
to hear someone say that.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.387
Is he dying?

24:32.471 --> 24:36.933
I was at Elkins Park Hospital on Sunday
when they talked to her.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.687
It's just gonna get worse.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.025
I don't know how much more I can take.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.320
Well, this day comes eventually,
like it or not.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.784
I'm an orphan.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.330
You are supposed
to take care of your husband

24:59.415 --> 25:02.041
and your beautiful children now.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.377
They are yours.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.547
You'll see.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.050
The minute you leave,
you'll remember him

25:11.135 --> 25:13.761
exactly the way he used to be.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.725
It's all good outside that door.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.194
Want these upstairs?

25:29.278 --> 25:32.363
No. I haνe to put it all in the wash.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.991
I'll go get the kids.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.452
Francine promised them
the pool tomorrow.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.579
Carla will bring them home later.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.875
I'm gonna take a shower.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.043
Don.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.795
What?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.590
I think you should leaνe.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.468
Really?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.136
Yes.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.974
Bets, you're upset.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.809
I am.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.395
And I know how you feel about grieving.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.691
I think I should be here for you.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.861
That's your reason.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.989
What do you want me to say?

26:16.992 --> 26:19.494
I want to be here.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.205
You need me here.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.332
Why?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.584
Nothing's changed.

26:26.669 --> 26:29.128
We were just pretending.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.070
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.780
Hello, Donna.

26:55.864 --> 26:56.864
Allison.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.075
Of course.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.686
Surprise!

27:38.407 --> 27:40.533
And this beautiful layette.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.286
We've also attempted
to fortify your castle.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.955
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,

27:46.040 --> 27:49.459
Pampers, and some Clearasil,
for when it gets bigger.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.794
You raided the storeroom for me.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.756
Now, Daddy-o, we've given
this a lot of thought.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.426
You are going to be blessed
with a stinking miracle.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.761
Stop it!

27:59.845 --> 28:03.222
So, in assessing the damage
to your private life,

28:03.307 --> 28:05.600
we've gotten you some reading material.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.061
What do you get for the man
who's about to have nothing?

28:08.145 --> 28:10.605
- No, no, no, no.
- Speech, speech.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.443
I'm νery touched by this party.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.486
That's the whole point.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.029
You're not going to be touched.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.699
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.869
I want to toast all of you.

28:24.953 --> 28:28.331
And let's hope when this baby comes
that he likes Luckys.

28:28.415 --> 28:31.334
Here's to the little one,
whatever it may be.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.586
- Cheers.
- Salut.

28:34.963 --> 28:39.759
I just wanted to say Happy Birthday.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.601
What's this?

28:48.727 --> 28:50.561
Tiffany's?

28:50.646 --> 28:52.772
Who's it from?

28:52.856 --> 28:54.148
From Jane.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.275
And Roger, I'm sure.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.072
Will you cut the cake, dear?

29:04.326 --> 29:05.410
Mr. Draper.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.744
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

29:06.829 --> 29:07.829
How is everything?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.748
About how those things are.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.668
Joan, if you don't mind,
can I borrow you for a moment?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.336
- Of course.
- Thank you.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.763
Thank you.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.184
And you have your meeting
with Mr. Odino at 1 0 tomorrow.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.563
And then Lee Garner, Jr.
and the TV department at 3.

29:33.647 --> 29:34.981
Cancel everything.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.858
Yes, of course.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.192
Reschedule for Friday?

29:38.277 --> 29:41.028
No. Clear the week.

29:41.113 --> 29:45.825
So. How was your family emergency?

29:45.909 --> 29:48.077
Memorable. Thank you.

29:48.162 --> 29:50.371
I assume that means everything's okay?

29:51.999 --> 29:54.876
I'm leaving for California tomorrow
for the Rocket Fair.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.711
Good for you.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.880
Sunshine, bikinis.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.217
But didn't we already send a couple men?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.386
Campbell and Kinsey?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.054
Not yet.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.726
Well, Campbell has got to go.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.020
I've held his hand through 30 phone calls.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.899
Very good, Don.
Bring me a bag of oranges.

30:17.983 --> 30:21.027
I'm sure Joan here can hold down the fort.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.029
She's been doing it so far.

30:23.113 --> 30:26.324
Told you you'd be in good hands
with Miss Holloway.

30:33.665 --> 30:38.336
I'll need you to send a memo to Mr. Kinsey
explaining this change in plans.

30:38.420 --> 30:41.422
I'll take care of it.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.008
You look like you didn't
get any sleep last night.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.969
I did.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.763
Go ahead. Lay down.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.765
I'll keep the drunks away.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.732
I heard it's very hard
to get anything done there

30:59.858 --> 31:01.067
because of the weather, you know?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.109
People don't work.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.653
Sounds good to me.

31:03.737 --> 31:06.364
I'm sure l'll be going sometime
in the next few months.

31:06.448 --> 31:07.532
All the networks keep saying

31:07.616 --> 31:10.117
how l need to come out
and shave my face.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.286
I mean show.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.996
What's in this?

31:14.081 --> 31:17.041
You're just gonna fly off
and leave your wife and newborn?

31:22.548 --> 31:26.300
I just want to say
that I am so happy for you

31:26.385 --> 31:29.303
and that you're gonna be the best father

31:29.388 --> 31:31.597
and that I'm really happy for you.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.599
Thank you.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.571
- Mr. Kinsey?
- Yes, Joan.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.699
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informed
that he will be going to Los Angeles

31:49.783 --> 31:51.033
for the convention.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.494
Great. We won't have to fly tourist.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.289
No. lt's just he and Mr. Campbell going.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.832
What?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.458
Don's going with Pete?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.919
He can't do that.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.172
I'm sure it must be disappointing.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.632
I'll need your tickets and your badges.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.552
That's not right. Why can't we all go?

32:09.636 --> 32:11.762
I really need everything right away.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.514
Or are they at home?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.648
Is there any cake left?

32:22.733 --> 32:25.276
Hey, Sheila. It's me.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.362
No, l know that.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.948
And I want you to know
I've thought about it--

32:31.033 --> 32:33.117
Let me finish.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.911
I'm going to stand there
arm-in-arm with you

32:35.996 --> 32:37.747
and make a stand.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.792
It's not just about you and me.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.421
I know that.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.177
No one's been shot lately. Okay?

32:53.639 --> 32:55.514
I loνe you, too, baby.

33:07.819 --> 33:08.819
Peggy.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.906
May l speak with you?

33:17.537 --> 33:18.913
Heck of a party.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.082
Yes.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.833
I'm going away, you know.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.585
Of course.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.213
On a plane.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.547
What do you want me to say?

33:28.632 --> 33:30.007
That I wish I was going?

33:30.092 --> 33:32.218
Everybody does.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.303
I've never even been on a plane.

33:34.388 --> 33:36.931
Well, I have.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.933
But not since my father died.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.271
I'm sorry.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.399
I'm not scared.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.359
It just seems significant, is all.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.319
Statistically speaking,

33:50.404 --> 33:52.196
it's very unlikely that it will happen

33:52.280 --> 33:54.657
to two people in one family.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.285
That's true.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.455
Besides, it wouldn't be the worst thing.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.374
Excuse me?

34:03.458 --> 34:06.001
I hate my mother.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.795
What do you think of that?

34:09.339 --> 34:10.881
Come on, you must haνe an opinion.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.592
I don't know the circumstances.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.095
I don't know what l should expect from her.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.138
I don't know her.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.056
Like Bud and I turned out so great.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.769
Who's to say it wouldn't be better?

34:23.854 --> 34:25.896
So it's not yours. That could be good.

34:25.981 --> 34:29.316
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.902
But I think your flight will be fine.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.573
You should go home.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.327
Everything's so easy for you.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.956
It's not easy for anyone, Pete.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.255
Have a great trip.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.557
What's there?

35:50.857 --> 35:51.982
Glen?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.528
What are you doing?

35:55.612 --> 35:58.405
Nothing.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.951
How long have you been out here?

36:02.035 --> 36:04.036
I don't know.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.746
A few days.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.085
What happened?

36:14.673 --> 36:17.800
I didn't know if I was
going to see you again.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.386
And then you weren't even home.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.014
Did you run away?

36:26.017 --> 36:28.269
So?

36:38.822 --> 36:41.407
I think you should tell me what happened.

36:41.491 --> 36:44.618
My dad wants Charlotte
and me to liνe with him.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.828
My mom doesn't care.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.163
I'm sure that's not true.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.625
She just wants to be with her boyfriends.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.712
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?

36:54.796 --> 36:57.131
I guess.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.216
They giνe me things.

37:01.386 --> 37:05.389
I haven't seen you in so long,
except driving down the street.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.060
I know. I know.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.647
Can l use the bathroom?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.901
Do you want me to wash your clothes?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.593
Is that shirt okay?

37:42.677 --> 37:44.720
That almost fits you.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.690
Go ahead.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.741
Why are you alone here?

38:05.825 --> 38:08.243
It's the middle of the day.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.621
It's lousy.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.168
You understand why your mother
was mad at me, I hope.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.379
Yeah.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.798
Because she doesn't understand.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.177
That's true.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.475
I'm not going home.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.644
Because I know I'm a problem for them.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.229
Glen.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.065
l know I am because
they keep saying I'm not.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.275
Did you do something?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.735
No.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.822
But my mom is never home.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.157
My dad has another baby.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.034
His wife is pretty mean.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.371
Where's your mother?

38:52.455 --> 38:54.873
I don't know.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.917
Writing pamphlets and handing them out.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.046
I'm pretty responsible.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.924
I brush my sister's teeth
and put us both to bed.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.677
That's very sweet of you.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.392
Aren't you going to eat?

39:38.084 --> 39:40.627
Can I tell you something?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.671
Of course.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.256
I don't like ham.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.634
I don't like meat at all, actually.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.305
I'm sorry.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.600
Do you want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

40:20.919 --> 40:23.253
I came to rescue you.

40:25.673 --> 40:26.924
Did you bring your cape?

40:27.008 --> 40:29.676
I'm not joking.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.970
We can go anywhere. I have money.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.643
Glen...

40:45.735 --> 40:48.695
- Mommy! I missed you!
- Mommy!

40:48.780 --> 40:51.615
I missed you, too.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.534
How is he?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.369
- Who?
- Your father.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.038
He's not good.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.957
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.

41:01.835 --> 41:03.877
Sally, Bobby, you remember
Glen from down the street.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.379
Hi, Glen.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.463
Hi.

41:06.548 --> 41:10.300
Why don't you take Glen upstairs
and show him the trains Daddy got you?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.553
You can use the controls.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.473
Go ahead. It's okay.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.150
What's he doing here?

41:35.994 --> 41:37.411
You're really bad.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.079
You think you can do any better?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.832
If l couldn't, I'd giνe up trying.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.546
What don't you like
about the speed shear?

41:54.804 --> 41:56.513
Glen, can you come in here?

42:02.979 --> 42:05.105
Glen, get over here now.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.149
I was worried sick.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.568
Glen, you have to go home.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.707
You can't do things like this.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.711
Let's go. Your father's on his way.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.214
I hate you.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.673
Apologize right this minute.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.592
No, it's true.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.636
I hate you.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.430
I know.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.561
I'm sorry.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.249
Come on. Let's wash up for dinner.

43:08.628 --> 43:11.546
Adνertising, if anything,
helps bring on change.

43:11.631 --> 43:14.883
The market-- and I'm talking
in a purely Marxist sense--

43:14.968 --> 43:17.970
dictates that we must include eνeryone.

43:18.054 --> 43:20.806
The consumer has no color.

43:34.904 --> 43:38.615
Betty, I'm sorry, but we really need to talk.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.746
There's nothing to talk about.

43:44.831 --> 43:48.709
I don't know why he was oνer here,
but this has to stop.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.049
Nothing's going on.

43:58.011 --> 44:00.554
Except that Glen feels alone.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.056
Honestly, I don't blame him.

44:03.141 --> 44:05.309
What did he say?

44:06.477 --> 44:08.145
Nothing.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.440
But it's obνious.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.650
He depends on you for eνerything.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.195
You're supposed to be taking care of him.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.989
You're his mother.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.699
And he gets nothing.

44:23.202 --> 44:26.872
I thought with Dan out of our lives,
it would be different.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.918
Glen's right.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.463
I'm not a very good mother anymore.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.768
Don isn't living here.

44:52.774 --> 44:55.525
I'm sorry.

44:58.071 --> 45:00.072
We haven't told the children.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.241
Is it over?

45:05.036 --> 45:07.788
I don't even know.

45:07.872 --> 45:10.957
That's the worst.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.751
Do they see him?

45:12.835 --> 45:15.545
He takes them to dinner.

45:17.757 --> 45:21.760
They don't know what made them
so special all of the sudden.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.137
I don't know.

45:24.222 --> 45:28.141
For me, it wasn't that different
without him there.

45:32.647 --> 45:35.649
Sometimes l feel like I'll float away

45:35.733 --> 45:38.527
if Don isn't holding me down.

45:43.908 --> 45:49.329
The hardest part
is realizing you're in charge.

46:01.759 --> 46:05.178
As you can see, the pilot has turned off
the "No Smoking" sign.

46:05.263 --> 46:09.307
We're expecting clear skies
en route to Los Angeles today.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.809
It should be a pleasant day,

46:10.893 --> 46:15.063
82 degrees and clear,
with a light Santa Ana wind.

46:15.148 --> 46:18.191
Trans World Airlines...
