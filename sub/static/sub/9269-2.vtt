00:32.996 --> 00:34.516
Are you all right?

00:35.716 --> 00:37.356
Hello?

00:43.056 --> 00:47.015
Inspector Sullivan, I thought you
could arrange for one of those

00:47.091 --> 00:48.730
surveillance-type operations.

00:49.501 --> 00:50.680
Surveillance?

00:50.758 --> 00:52.638
Yes, and dust for fingerprints.

00:54.518 --> 00:57.117
Now, you can start with this.

00:57.118 --> 00:58.397
Mrs McCready...

00:58.398 --> 01:00.277
Mrs McCarthy.

01:00.278 --> 01:04.038
Believe it or not, strawberry theft
is not my greatest priority.

01:05.238 --> 01:07.878
Now see here, young man!

01:09.198 --> 01:12.997
Oh, I see - our concerns
are beneath you, are they?

01:12.998 --> 01:14.197
Big city boy.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.628
That's not what I meant.

01:15.629 --> 01:18.748
I'll have you know, my award-winning
strawberry scones

01:18.749 --> 01:20.268
put Kembleford on the map.

01:20.269 --> 01:24.628
At least Inspector Valentine
took his responsibilities seriously.

01:24.629 --> 01:25.988
You're not even listening!

01:25.989 --> 01:27.308
I can't get a word out of him.

01:27.309 --> 01:29.188
Sir?

01:29.189 --> 01:30.629
Can you hear me?

01:35.869 --> 01:37.029
Murder.

01:42.589 --> 01:46.188
His heart's stopped.
Call an ambulance!

01:46.189 --> 01:47.989
Call an ambulance!

01:48.272 --> 02:15.928

02:17.603 --> 02:20.562
"..though he were dead,
he shall live.

02:20.563 --> 02:24.403
"And whosoever liveth and believeth
in me, shall not die forever."

02:26.763 --> 02:29.202
And you didn't observe
anyone near him?

02:29.203 --> 02:32.682
Not that I recall. By the way...

02:32.683 --> 02:35.602
Lady Felicia. A pleasure.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.162
Yes.

02:37.163 --> 02:40.402
I haven't seen
Felix at mass in a long time.

02:40.403 --> 02:42.282
Nor his wife, for that matter.

02:42.283 --> 02:44.042
Looks to me as if he's
been in hospital.

02:44.043 --> 02:46.162
And why did he say "murder"?

02:46.163 --> 02:50.362
"Murder"? Mrs McCarthy,
I'd appreciate some discretion.

02:50.363 --> 02:51.922
Good luck that.

02:51.923 --> 02:55.082
And what's that supposed to mean?
Simply that you're disadvantaged

02:55.083 --> 02:57.362
when it comes to the
control of your tongue.

02:57.363 --> 03:00.642
Well, at least I'm not in the
habit of following half-naked men

03:00.643 --> 03:03.562
up the street. Oh!

03:03.563 --> 03:05.682
Any sign of foul play?

03:05.683 --> 03:07.723
Humbug? No.

03:09.203 --> 03:15.042
Based on preliminary observations,
I'd say heart failure.

03:15.043 --> 03:19.123
What about the cuts on the hand?
Right palm.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.362
Minor abrasions.

03:24.363 --> 03:26.682
Defensive wounds?

03:26.683 --> 03:30.202
I believe your work is done here,
Father.

03:30.203 --> 03:34.643
That used to be my husband.
Always smiling.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.163
Always quick with a joke.

03:40.523 --> 03:43.883
When he came back from the war,
it was like he'd been gutted.

03:45.283 --> 03:50.642
Everything he used to be,
wrenched out of him.

03:50.643 --> 03:52.002
Who's the other gentleman?

03:52.003 --> 03:56.162
His brother.
He was killed in action.

03:56.163 --> 04:00.243
Last month, I finally realised
I couldn't take it any more.

04:02.163 --> 04:05.203
The years of silence. The stillness.

04:07.203 --> 04:10.922
So I told him.

04:10.923 --> 04:14.283
Told him I'd leave him if he didn't
do something about it.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.762
I'd... found a place.

04:20.202 --> 04:23.642
They specialise in trauma
and shellshock for veterans.

04:23.643 --> 04:25.403
Did... Did...

04:27.843 --> 04:29.443
Did Felix have any enemies?

04:31.043 --> 04:33.003
He hardly even left the house.

04:35.603 --> 04:39.362
Why?
Do you think it could have been...?

04:39.363 --> 04:42.283
Just a routine question.
Nothing to worry about.

04:45.043 --> 04:46.403
More tea? Mmm!

04:54.123 --> 04:56.642
Two suggestions, if I may.

04:56.643 --> 05:00.482
Either Mr Underwood met an enemy
at this "retreat"

05:00.483 --> 05:03.522
or he wasn't
talking about his own murder.

05:03.523 --> 05:06.762
Father Brown, I've been
well-briefed by my predecessor

05:06.763 --> 05:09.922
on your propensity
for extra-curricular deduction.

05:09.923 --> 05:13.002
But I propose that you
manage the funeral

05:13.003 --> 05:15.482
and I'll manage the investigation.

05:15.483 --> 05:16.682
Agreed?

05:16.683 --> 05:17.843
Of course.

06:38.803 --> 06:40.243
Can I help you?

06:43.883 --> 06:48.763
Father Brown. I'm here
about your patient, Felix Underwood.

06:52.523 --> 06:54.763
We've just been informed. Terrible.

06:56.363 --> 06:58.522
How did he escape?

06:58.523 --> 07:00.802
May I ask, what's your interest?

07:00.803 --> 07:03.722
I'm gathering
information for the Requiem mass.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.802
Even so, you'll have to leave.

07:05.803 --> 07:08.962
The presence of a priest could
disturb the patients.

07:08.963 --> 07:13.882
How so? Connotations of hell
and damnation. I'll show you to the door.

07:13.883 --> 07:15.162
Nurse Farrow.

07:15.163 --> 07:17.002
That won't be necessary.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.122
But the patients...

07:18.123 --> 07:20.882
They'll be fine.
Dr Henshaw. Director.

07:20.883 --> 07:23.442
Father Brown. Priest.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.763
Let me show you around.

07:27.883 --> 07:30.562
My apologies for Nurse Farrow.

07:30.563 --> 07:32.482
She's always been somewhat
over-zealous

07:32.483 --> 07:35.842
but she only has the patients'
best interests at heart.

07:35.843 --> 07:37.842
We're devastated about what's
happened.

07:37.843 --> 07:41.482
Felix seemed to be making progress.

07:41.483 --> 07:43.363
He'd never sleepwalked before.

07:44.723 --> 07:47.522
You think that's what happened?

07:47.523 --> 07:49.603
Seems the most likely explanation.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.642
What kind of therapy do you
practice,

07:54.643 --> 07:56.482
if you don't mind my asking?

07:56.483 --> 07:58.402
We take a humanistic approach.

07:58.403 --> 08:01.922
Role-play, visualisations,
encounter groups.

08:01.923 --> 08:03.762
Nothing invasive.

08:03.763 --> 08:05.122
Fascinating.

08:05.123 --> 08:07.243
You've an interest
in my line of work?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.922
Well, in a sense,
we're not that different.

08:11.923 --> 08:17.202
Both in the same business of helping
people on a road to a better self.

08:17.203 --> 08:18.523
Please...

08:33.203 --> 08:34.962
My daddy's a wizard.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.682
So are you, by the look of it.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.361
Benjamin made this for me.

08:38.363 --> 08:40.121
Benjamin? Former patient.

08:40.123 --> 08:41.562
Jeremy, it's time for elevenses.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.121
Are you a wizard?

08:43.123 --> 08:45.603
As it happens.

08:54.443 --> 08:57.722
Elevenses, Jeremy.
More magic! More magic!

08:57.723 --> 08:59.642
We've got your favourite biscuits.

08:59.643 --> 09:04.122
NOW! Jeremy, calm down.
Deep breaths. All right?

09:04.123 --> 09:06.802
What do we do when we feel upset?

09:06.803 --> 09:08.123
Count to ten.

09:09.163 --> 09:10.803
OK.

09:12.963 --> 09:16.722
Sorry about that.
He's prone to the odd tantrum.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.562
He seems very young to be
ex-service personnel.

09:19.563 --> 09:22.762
On occasion,
we cater to their relatives.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.442
Jeremy's father was
killed in the war.

09:25.443 --> 09:28.123
His mother couldn't cope,
so she sent him here.

09:30.443 --> 09:33.243
May I use your facilities?
Just on the right.

09:36.723 --> 09:39.602
Dr Henshaw? Inspector Sullivan.

09:39.603 --> 09:41.482
We spoke on the phone.

09:41.483 --> 09:44.722
I'd like to start by seeing
a list of all the patients who were

09:44.723 --> 09:47.242
here during Mr Underwood's stay.

09:47.243 --> 09:50.002
I'm afraid that won't be possible,
Inspector.

09:50.003 --> 09:52.522
Confidentiality, you understand.

09:52.523 --> 09:58.282
Oh. Given the circumstances,
I was hoping for some co-operation.

09:58.283 --> 10:01.322
I assure you, I'm not being
obstructive but, like you,

10:01.323 --> 10:04.802
I'm bound by certain legal
and ethical principles.

10:04.803 --> 10:07.603
Produce a court order,
and I'd be happy to oblige.

10:33.203 --> 10:34.843
Patient register.

10:46.963 --> 10:49.842
Romans 10:10.

10:49.843 --> 10:51.363
10:10.

11:06.003 --> 11:09.082
Romans 10:10.

11:09.083 --> 11:12.722
"For, with the heart,
we believe unto justice

11:12.723 --> 11:16.803
"but, with the mouth
we confess unto salvation."

11:33.923 --> 11:35.203
Deep breath.

11:38.003 --> 11:39.323
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:01.923 --> 12:03.882
Stop!

12:03.883 --> 12:05.603
Down! Down! Please, down!

12:24.843 --> 12:27.603
Is he dead? Alive?

12:29.243 --> 12:32.082
Does he even have a soul?

12:32.083 --> 12:34.882
As far as I can tell,
he's in perfect health.

12:34.883 --> 12:37.402
Two days ago you certified him dead.

12:37.403 --> 12:39.682
Because he had no pulse
and he wasn't breathing.

12:39.683 --> 12:41.282
Good thing he wasn't embalmed.

12:41.283 --> 12:43.442
Or given a postmortem,
for that matter.

12:43.443 --> 12:47.562
I swear to God, that man was not
alive when I examined him,

12:47.563 --> 12:50.722
which leads me to conclude that this
is more your department than mine.

12:50.723 --> 12:53.762
While I can't completely rule out
a supernatural resurrection,

12:53.763 --> 12:57.523
I would be more inclined to go
for the rational explanation first.

13:03.683 --> 13:04.723
Mr Underwood?

13:06.563 --> 13:10.323
Felix. Can you tell us
what happened to you?

13:14.123 --> 13:15.842
Perhaps if you took him home,

13:15.843 --> 13:18.802
maybe in familiar surroundings,
that may jog his memory.

13:18.803 --> 13:20.482
I don't want him in my home.

13:20.483 --> 13:22.882
Mrs Underwood,
I know this is difficult.

13:22.883 --> 13:26.682
Difficult? My husband just came
back from the dead.

13:26.683 --> 13:29.402
Dorothy, I suspect Felix
was never dead.

13:29.403 --> 13:31.203
Look at the cuts on his hands.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.003
Healing.

14:00.043 --> 14:02.402
Perhaps you could show him
some photos.

14:02.403 --> 14:05.643
Play some songs he liked.

14:09.763 --> 14:11.363
I have a confession to make.

14:16.203 --> 14:20.042
How did you get this?
I paid a visit to Danvers Retreat.

14:20.043 --> 14:23.402
It sort of fell into my cassock. Do you
realise I could arrest you on the spot?

14:23.403 --> 14:26.762
And thwart your own investigation?
You're interfering in official police...

14:26.763 --> 14:28.522
I know, I know. I'm terrible,
aren't I?

14:28.523 --> 14:30.882
The point is,
that one of the patients,

14:30.883 --> 14:34.162
Benjamin Pennington, was
admitted for two weeks' observation,

14:34.163 --> 14:38.722
but was discharged only a week
later, on the same day Felix disappeared.

14:38.723 --> 14:41.162
Suspicious, don't you think?
Or a coincidence.

14:41.163 --> 14:48.082
Possibly, but surely it can't hurt to find
the whereabouts of Benjamin Pennington.

14:48.083 --> 14:51.082
I'll pay them another visit.
You'll need my assistance.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.162
Why's that?

14:52.163 --> 14:54.563
In case of clues
of a Biblical nature.

15:06.243 --> 15:07.882
Alive?

15:07.883 --> 15:09.563
Although somewhat subdued.

15:12.123 --> 15:13.522
I'd like him readmitted.

15:13.523 --> 15:17.562
That won't be possible
until the investigation's over.

15:17.563 --> 15:20.242
Are you implying I'm some
sort of threat?

15:20.243 --> 15:23.882
Just before Mr Underwood collapsed,
he said the word "murder".

15:23.883 --> 15:27.602
What are you suggesting?
That someone here tried to kill him?

15:27.603 --> 15:30.122
At present,
I'm just collating information.

15:30.123 --> 15:34.522
On which point, I'd like to
interview your former patient, Benjamin.

15:34.523 --> 15:37.642
The one who made the
wizard hat for Jeremy.

15:37.643 --> 15:40.202
Well, he discharged himself
a few days ago.

15:40.203 --> 15:44.202
In that case, I'd like to
interview your current patients,

15:44.203 --> 15:47.402
starting with a young woman -
dark, curly hair.

15:47.403 --> 15:49.202
Sarah Mulgrew.

15:49.203 --> 15:50.762
She's unlikely to be of use.

15:50.763 --> 15:53.922
Communicates almost entirely
through Bible passages.

15:53.923 --> 15:55.482
Memorised the entire thing.

15:55.483 --> 16:00.003
Luckily, I know the good book
like the back of my hand.

16:03.323 --> 16:05.603
She's probably
in the recreation room.

16:08.683 --> 16:09.723
Right.

16:11.163 --> 16:12.443
"Genesis 18:4."

16:13.523 --> 16:18.162
"But I will fetch a little water,
and wash ye your feet,

16:18.163 --> 16:19.683
"and rest ye under a tree".

16:21.763 --> 16:22.923
Meaning?

16:25.043 --> 16:27.123
"Fetch a little water."

16:28.163 --> 16:31.962
Any rivers nearby? Dr Henshaw?

16:31.963 --> 16:33.483
"Rest ye under a tree."

16:37.763 --> 16:40.202
Disused.
Belonged to the farm next door.

16:40.203 --> 16:42.362
You think this is what
she was referring to?

16:42.363 --> 16:44.722
I'm sure of it. How?

16:44.723 --> 16:47.922
"Genesis 23:4."

16:47.923 --> 16:49.803
Like the back of your hand?

16:51.403 --> 16:53.882
Blast it! Oh, dear.

16:53.883 --> 16:55.762
"I am a stranger
and a sojourner with you:

16:55.763 --> 16:58.522
"give me a possession of a
burying place,

16:58.523 --> 17:00.363
"that I may bury my dead..."

17:15.883 --> 17:17.563
There's a body.

17:24.522 --> 17:25.563
Remember this?

17:28.643 --> 17:30.963
We listened to it
before you shipped out.

17:32.883 --> 17:34.683
Danced together in this room.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.523
Why was I in a coffin?

18:27.963 --> 18:31.763
We thought you were dead.
You weren't breathing.

18:35.243 --> 18:36.283
Re-born.

18:37.723 --> 18:38.763
What?

18:41.003 --> 18:42.483
What happened?

18:49.723 --> 18:51.003
I'm hungry.

18:53.363 --> 18:55.683
I'll make you something to eat.

19:07.283 --> 19:09.203
Mr Pennington? Yes.

19:11.843 --> 19:14.122
Stabbed in the chest.

19:14.123 --> 19:17.723
Based on the rigor,
I'd say he was killed two days ago.

19:20.603 --> 19:24.922
Is it my imagination,
or is the doctor intoxicated?

19:24.923 --> 19:27.042
Oh, dear.

19:27.043 --> 19:31.162
This what passes
for professionalism, is it?

19:31.163 --> 19:32.642
Oh, dammit!

19:32.643 --> 19:34.802
Oh, dear.

19:34.803 --> 19:38.882
At least that may explain why he
mistakenly certified Felix's death.

19:38.883 --> 19:42.922
An asinine consolation,
if I ever heard one.

19:42.923 --> 19:46.202
What time did Mr Pennington
discharge himself?

19:46.203 --> 19:48.322
I think it was around 4pm.

19:48.323 --> 19:50.282
You didn't see him
on the grounds afterwards?

19:50.283 --> 19:52.442
If I'd seen him,
I would've mentioned it.

19:52.443 --> 19:55.123
I don't appreciate
your insinuations, Inspector.

19:56.163 --> 19:57.802
Benjamin!

19:57.803 --> 20:00.922
Calm down. Benjamin! Jeremy, no!

20:00.923 --> 20:02.763
Count to ten. It's all right.

20:05.123 --> 20:07.202
He's going to wake up.

20:07.203 --> 20:10.003
I'm afraid not, Jeremy. I'm sorry.

20:46.523 --> 20:48.603
May I join you?

20:53.483 --> 20:58.842
I'm very impressed with
your knowledge of my favourite book.

20:58.843 --> 21:02.163
Dare I say it, you know
it better than me.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.523
John 1:1.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.642
Wait. No, wait. Don't tell me.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.243
Let me see if I can get it
without looking it up.

21:14.643 --> 21:16.003
No, give up.

21:18.243 --> 21:22.722
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

21:22.723 --> 21:24.643
"and the Word was God."

21:25.963 --> 21:27.003
Mmm.

21:28.883 --> 21:30.323
What about Romans 10:10?

21:33.283 --> 21:35.563
Is there something you want
to confess?

21:40.123 --> 21:44.203
It was supposed to be me. My turn.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.362
Your turn? For what?

21:49.363 --> 21:51.003
John 11:25.

21:54.003 --> 21:57.842
"I am the resurrection
and the life."

21:57.843 --> 22:03.842
"He that believeth in me,
although he be dead, shall live."

22:03.843 --> 22:08.883
But I got scared.
So Benjamin took my place.

22:13.483 --> 22:14.523
Took your place?

22:17.363 --> 22:18.403
In what?

22:21.843 --> 22:24.442
Dr Henshaw!

22:24.443 --> 22:27.122
He was interrogating Sarah.

22:27.123 --> 22:28.642
Interrogating?

22:28.643 --> 22:29.962
Without my supervision?

22:29.963 --> 22:31.802
Go to your room.

22:31.803 --> 22:34.202
Wait. I want to ask you
a few questions first.

22:34.203 --> 22:36.042
Inspector, I must protest.

22:36.043 --> 22:38.122
How did you know there
was a body down the well?

22:38.123 --> 22:39.922
Enough.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.482
It's all right.

22:41.483 --> 22:43.363
Father, I must insist you leave.

22:48.803 --> 22:50.362
She was trying to tell me something.

22:50.363 --> 22:51.643
My hands are tied.

22:54.203 --> 22:57.083
I apologise for my behaviour.
I'll be leaving now.

23:06.243 --> 23:07.802
Terribly sorry. How embarrassing.

23:07.803 --> 23:11.882
Lately I've been having a problem
with my impulse control.

23:11.883 --> 23:15.243
It's when I get nervous.
I'd better be going.

23:19.843 --> 23:22.523
Father Brown!
I appear to be having an episode.

23:26.283 --> 23:28.203
Father!

23:29.723 --> 23:32.203
I'm sorry, Inspector.
I can't help myself.

23:34.123 --> 23:40.162
Doctor, I suggest you admit
Father Brown

23:40.163 --> 23:43.002
for psychiatric evaluation.

23:43.003 --> 23:46.602
The retreat's only for ex-service
personnel.

23:46.603 --> 23:50.002
I was in the Glosters.
An army chaplain.

23:50.003 --> 23:51.682
Unfortunately, we're full.

23:51.683 --> 23:55.282
Last I counted, you had at least
two empty beds.

23:55.283 --> 23:58.723
I'm starting to find your
reluctance somewhat suspicious.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.882
Nurse, fetch an admissions form.

24:02.883 --> 24:04.043
Now.

24:10.763 --> 24:13.803
Are you sure you know what
you're doing? Absolutely.

24:29.803 --> 24:35.322
You should leave me.
What else is there left to do?

24:35.323 --> 24:37.282
You could talk to me.

24:37.283 --> 24:39.882
What good is that?

24:39.883 --> 24:43.002
Better than keeping
things bottled up.

24:43.003 --> 24:47.002
Maybe that's where some
things belong.

24:47.003 --> 24:49.203
You're a coward.

24:52.443 --> 24:53.482
Felix!

24:53.483 --> 24:54.523
Benjamin.

25:00.163 --> 25:02.122
Who's Benjamin?

25:02.123 --> 25:03.523
No!

25:07.843 --> 25:08.963
Felix!

25:11.483 --> 25:16.762
Kleptomania? Frequently. Mr Hammond's
apple tree is a particular casualty.

25:16.763 --> 25:18.242
Gambling?

25:18.243 --> 25:19.602
I like an occasional flutter.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.642
Occasional?

25:21.643 --> 25:22.722
Every day.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.002
Compulsive eating?

25:24.003 --> 25:26.922
Who can resist second helpings?

25:26.923 --> 25:29.122
Or third.

25:29.123 --> 25:31.042
Or fourth.

25:31.043 --> 25:35.082
Do you ever have the urge to
take off your clothes in public?

25:35.083 --> 25:38.602
Often, especially during mass.

25:38.603 --> 25:41.602
Thank you for your candour, Father.

25:41.603 --> 25:44.242
That concludes the evaluation.
Nurse Farrow?

25:44.243 --> 25:45.802
Congratulations.

25:45.803 --> 25:51.082
You score highly on most markers
for impulse control disorder.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.082
You would seem to be
in the right place.

25:54.083 --> 25:57.163
We'll start you on a treatment
plan tomorrow morning.

26:02.803 --> 26:04.842
Thank you.

26:04.843 --> 26:07.723
It's such a relief to be finally
getting some help.

26:32.843 --> 26:34.323
May I come in?

26:35.723 --> 26:37.723
Please return to the ward, Father.

26:53.043 --> 26:54.842
Father Brown!

26:54.843 --> 26:57.602
Visiting hours are over.

26:57.603 --> 27:00.322
I'm here on official church business.

27:00.323 --> 27:01.402
Irrelevant.

27:01.403 --> 27:05.242
Nurse, trust me it would be simpler
if you let her stay.

27:05.243 --> 27:08.963
She'll only be here for a
few minutes, I promise you.

27:11.363 --> 27:15.042
I always suspected you were a few
pints short of a milk churn,

27:15.043 --> 27:17.042
but a lunatic asylum?

27:17.043 --> 27:18.602
I'm investigating.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.082
So I gather.

27:20.083 --> 27:23.202
This one's definitely dead, is he?
There's no chance he might...

27:23.203 --> 27:25.162
None at all.

27:25.163 --> 27:29.203
And what if the killer decides
he doesn't want you investigating?

27:31.523 --> 27:35.322
I've brought you a casserole -
heaven only knows what kind of food

27:35.323 --> 27:37.562
they serve in this place.

27:37.563 --> 27:38.803
The soup's very good.

27:40.203 --> 27:41.443
Very decorative. Oh.

27:44.003 --> 27:48.002
Mrs McCarthy, how would you like to
assist me in my investigation?

27:48.003 --> 27:50.202
Don't be teasing.

27:50.203 --> 27:51.842
You see that cabinet?

27:51.843 --> 27:56.202
There's a key in there -
three down, two from the right.

27:56.203 --> 27:59.962
While I distract the nurse,
I'd like you to pinch it for me.

27:59.963 --> 28:01.042
What's it for?

28:01.043 --> 28:04.322
Let's keep things on a
need-to-know basis, shall we?

28:04.323 --> 28:06.722
Shall I bake it into one
of my scones and bring it...

28:06.723 --> 28:11.922
No, leave it under the flowerpot
in the corridor on your way out.

28:11.923 --> 28:16.842
Remember - three down,
two from the right.

28:16.843 --> 28:18.122
Right you are.

28:18.123 --> 28:20.882
Lovely to see you, Father.

28:20.883 --> 28:24.202
And I hope you'll be feeling
better soon.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.683
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.

28:39.843 --> 28:44.162
Nurse, I wonder if I might trouble
you for a glass of water.

28:44.163 --> 28:45.963
I'm afraid I feel rather faint.

28:54.723 --> 28:56.243
Thank you.

28:59.803 --> 29:03.603
I'm terribly sorry.
Thank you, thank you. Sorry.

29:08.043 --> 29:09.283
Three down!

29:10.843 --> 29:13.202
I'm most terribly sorry.
I'm afraid...

29:13.203 --> 29:15.242
..impulse control issue again.

29:15.243 --> 29:17.203
Would you be so kind?

30:55.883 --> 30:58.723
Sarah? Sarah?

31:12.523 --> 31:14.962
What are you doing? Ssh!

31:14.963 --> 31:16.203
What are you doing?

31:19.243 --> 31:22.643
I wanted to talk to
Sarah about your friend Benjamin.

31:25.403 --> 31:28.402
How did he get down the well?

31:28.403 --> 31:31.843
I don't want to talk about Benjamin.
Do more magic.

31:41.243 --> 31:43.283
I've got one too.

31:46.443 --> 31:47.483
Ah!

31:49.643 --> 31:51.043
What does yours unlock?

31:52.483 --> 31:54.762
The magic potion room.

31:54.763 --> 31:56.083
How exciting.

32:07.563 --> 32:12.482
"Test subjects, Felix Underwood
and Benjamin Pennington.

32:12.483 --> 32:15.923
"Present, Dr Walter Henshaw
and Nurse Bridget Farrow."

32:17.483 --> 32:19.723
Tetrodotoxin amalgamate.

32:22.803 --> 32:24.043
Psilocybin Extract.

32:25.923 --> 32:27.443
Psilocybin.

32:29.283 --> 32:33.243
Felix Underwood, Benjamin Pennington.
Psilocybin, ten milligrams.

32:47.243 --> 32:51.082
'I can't.'
'Yes, you can. Unburden yourself.'

32:51.083 --> 32:52.802
'Only then can you be reborn.'

32:52.803 --> 32:56.122
'I can't do it. I can't.'

32:56.123 --> 32:59.643
Reborn?
'Say the words, Felix. Forgive him!'

33:00.683 --> 33:01.723
'Argh!'

33:03.843 --> 33:04.883
'Argh!'

33:07.003 --> 33:09.203
Jeremy, back to bed.

33:12.803 --> 33:14.043
Key.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.723
I've told you before,
this isn't a play room.

33:20.763 --> 33:28.362
Psilocybin. If I remember my botany,
that is an hallucinogenic alkaloid.

33:28.363 --> 33:32.203
In small doses, it helps the patients
to engage with their emotions.

33:34.163 --> 33:36.722
Is that what Felix was doing?

33:36.723 --> 33:38.762
Exactly.

33:38.763 --> 33:44.402
What happened next?
I guess there was a struggle.

33:44.403 --> 33:46.802
That's what broke
the mirror in the therapy room.

33:46.803 --> 33:48.802
That mirror's been broken for weeks.

33:48.803 --> 33:51.002
Not the shard I saw on the floor.

33:51.003 --> 33:53.803
That was recent -
not a speck of dust on it.

33:56.483 --> 34:01.002
You've been experimenting
with your patients.

34:01.003 --> 34:05.042
Nurse, the patient appears to be
having some sort of delusional episode.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.762
Agreed.

34:06.763 --> 34:12.161
"Men will always be mad -
and those that try to cure them..."

34:12.163 --> 34:15.802
"...are the maddest of all."
Voltaire.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.562
He also wrote that nothing is more
contrary to the clergy

34:19.563 --> 34:21.601
than reason and common sense.

34:21.603 --> 34:25.683
Quite the opposite - my common sense
tells me that I should be going.

34:31.523 --> 34:32.723
I'm sorry, Father.

34:39.003 --> 34:44.161
My formula. Tetrodotoxin amalgamate.

34:44.163 --> 34:48.722
Lowers respiration and heart rate
to an almost undetectable level.

34:48.723 --> 34:52.202
The drug you administered to Felix
the night he disappeared.

34:52.203 --> 34:56.002
Reconstituted - should take
effect much quicker this time.

34:56.003 --> 35:00.122
Though you should be aware, its
side-effects include memory loss.

35:00.123 --> 35:04.362
Is that why you gave it to him?
To erase his memory?

35:04.363 --> 35:08.042
On the contrary, I was trying
to re-awaken his spirit.

35:08.043 --> 35:10.402
By simulating death?

35:10.403 --> 35:15.922
By cleansing his psyche.
A sort of baptism, if you like.

35:15.923 --> 35:19.563
I assume you've subjected
your method to clinical trials?

35:22.403 --> 35:25.322
Tested it for evidence of efficacy?

35:25.323 --> 35:29.043
If it's evidence you want,
then look no further.

35:32.323 --> 35:34.762
You were his patient?

35:34.763 --> 35:39.362
The trauma of childhood abuse
washed away virtually overnight.

35:39.363 --> 35:41.962
Nothing short of a miracle.

35:41.963 --> 35:44.722
What about Felix Underwood?

35:44.723 --> 35:46.803
Traumatised. Ben Pennington?

35:48.363 --> 35:50.362
Murdered. That was an accident.

35:50.363 --> 35:51.843
Don't let him get to you.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.802
I was trying to help them.

35:57.803 --> 36:01.002
I instructed Felix to imagine that
Benjamin was the soldier who

36:01.003 --> 36:02.882
killed his brother.

36:02.883 --> 36:04.922
To forgive him.

36:04.923 --> 36:08.602
I can't. Yes, you can.
Unburden yourself.

36:08.603 --> 36:11.722
Only then can you be reborn. I can't!

36:11.723 --> 36:16.962
Say the words, Felix.
Felix, forgive him.

36:16.963 --> 36:19.442
'He had a psychotic reaction.'

36:19.443 --> 36:21.243
No!

36:28.723 --> 36:30.563
Argh!

36:35.883 --> 36:38.963
Understandably,
he was distraught at what he'd done.

36:40.243 --> 36:45.322
So we administered the
rebirthing formula straightaway

36:45.323 --> 36:47.523
and hurried off to
dispose of the body.

36:53.523 --> 36:58.043
I know it was wrong to cover up the
death, but what choice did I have?

37:01.323 --> 37:02.803
It's my life's work.

37:05.483 --> 37:07.803
To have the potential
to heal thousands.

37:10.123 --> 37:12.762
Millions, even.

37:12.763 --> 37:17.203
Or just one. That's what you're
hoping for, isn't it?

37:18.323 --> 37:19.883
To heal Jeremy.

37:22.243 --> 37:23.803
Your son.

37:27.123 --> 37:28.483
What happened to him?

37:32.923 --> 37:34.443
There was a storm.

37:37.443 --> 37:41.962
Bend in the road
I didn't see in time.

37:41.963 --> 37:44.083
It wasn't your fault.
I was drinking.

37:53.803 --> 37:55.843
I killed his mother.

37:57.523 --> 38:00.483
And turned my
five-year-old son into...

38:02.443 --> 38:04.482
..what he is.

38:04.483 --> 38:09.883
A sweet, imaginative boy who
loves his father? Isn't that enough?

38:11.363 --> 38:14.122
I can help him to be so much more.

38:14.123 --> 38:18.602
Once I've perfected my formula,
I can repair the damage.

38:18.603 --> 38:20.362
He can be reborn.

38:20.363 --> 38:23.042
At what cost?

38:23.043 --> 38:25.562
Benjamin was an innocent.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.962
Don't listen to him.

38:27.963 --> 38:32.162
His blood is on your hands!

38:32.163 --> 38:34.522
And on mine.

38:34.523 --> 38:37.482
I remember.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.922
Don't.

38:38.923 --> 38:44.682
No. Do it. Make me forget...

38:44.683 --> 38:46.523
Make me forget.

38:49.363 --> 38:54.163
How many more have to suffer in
your quest for personal redemption?

38:57.803 --> 39:00.802
How many more years
looking at your son

39:00.803 --> 39:04.923
and seeing only what you've lost,
not what you have?

39:06.483 --> 39:08.562
I can't.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.002
Let go of your guilt.

39:11.003 --> 39:13.283
I can't. Enough of this.

39:25.723 --> 39:27.003
No!

39:28.403 --> 39:30.443
No.

39:39.203 --> 39:40.723
No!

39:43.523 --> 39:47.403
Nurse Farrow,
take care of our patient.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.123
Yes, Doctor.

39:55.203 --> 39:56.243
What happens now?

40:00.243 --> 40:01.283
Healing.

40:14.523 --> 40:16.642
Please. Not in front of my son.

40:16.643 --> 40:17.882
What's happening?

40:17.883 --> 40:21.642
Daddy's going away for a while.

40:21.643 --> 40:24.203
Have you been bad?

40:26.603 --> 40:29.323
Count to ten, Daddy. It's all right.

40:32.843 --> 40:34.163
My clever boy.

40:47.963 --> 40:49.003
Mrs Underwood?

40:50.563 --> 40:54.122
I'll be speaking
to the prosecuting solicitors.

40:54.123 --> 40:57.883
I can't make any promises, but
I don't believe they'll charge him.

41:00.803 --> 41:03.802
Are you all right?

41:03.803 --> 41:05.003
I remember.

41:12.043 --> 41:13.523
Father Brown?

41:16.083 --> 41:18.122
I'd like to see you at the station.

41:18.123 --> 41:19.563
I'll be there directly.

41:30.563 --> 41:34.683
I am always at St Mary's
and you are ALWAYS welcome.

41:37.443 --> 41:39.203
Matthew 9:22.

42:11.723 --> 42:13.522
A man of letters.

42:13.523 --> 42:15.202
You sound surprised.

42:15.203 --> 42:17.682
Pleasantly.

42:17.683 --> 42:19.322
Reminders to me that reason

42:19.323 --> 42:22.282
and rationality are the primary
tools of an enquiring mind.

42:22.283 --> 42:24.762
Couldn't agree more.

42:24.763 --> 42:26.963
Is that so? Now you sound surprised.

42:28.923 --> 42:32.602
Not qualities
I associate with men of faith.

42:32.603 --> 42:36.162
Then I imagine we have a great deal
to learn from each other.

42:36.163 --> 42:37.923
A peace offering.

42:46.883 --> 42:48.843
Thank you... so much.

42:51.283 --> 42:53.962
Arrest warrant.

42:53.963 --> 42:55.602
For me?

42:55.603 --> 42:58.682
Good guess. But no. Dr Miller.

42:58.683 --> 43:02.202
I'm having him
charged with criminal negligence.

43:02.203 --> 43:03.882
Bit harsh.

43:03.883 --> 43:07.882
I won't tolerate professional
impropriety of any kind.

43:07.883 --> 43:09.962
Now, it would be churlish of me

43:09.963 --> 43:13.882
to deny you've been of some facility
in the solving of this case...

43:13.883 --> 43:15.082
Thank you.

43:15.083 --> 43:17.762
..which is the only reason I'm
holding one warrant in my hand,

43:17.763 --> 43:19.762
and not two.

43:19.763 --> 43:24.403
But trust me, next time
you won't get off so lightly.

43:25.803 --> 43:27.403
That's all.
