Okay.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.153
Detention.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.982
Necessary evil, or an outdated
mode of incarceration--

00:29.855 --> 00:30.856
Okay.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.902
In three, two...

00:33.642 --> 00:35.035
Detention.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.601
Still an important part
of modern school discipline,

00:36.645 --> 00:38.386
or an antiquated vestige?

00:38.429 --> 00:40.518
From Brunswick High News,
I'm Claire Mclaskey and--

00:40.562 --> 00:41.911
No, no, no!

00:44.566 --> 00:46.394
Okay,
lets start with your name.

00:46.437 --> 00:47.482
People know me.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.397
Totally,
but for posterity.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.138
Brooke Cabot.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.748
And what are you in
detention for?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.359
You know how
to work this thing?

00:55.403 --> 00:56.534
I do. Yeah.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.188
The school paper
got us a new camera

00:58.232 --> 01:00.060
but not new tripods.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.844
Our school has a paper?

01:01.887 --> 01:04.977
Yeah, a paper and
a weekly news show, too.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.850
I was in Algebra
and Mr. Clark,

01:07.893 --> 01:08.981
since he's an old perv...

01:09.025 --> 01:11.027
asked me what I was
doing this weekend.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.725
I said, "Your mom"
and he got all flus-ltrated.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.727
And would you say
detention is worthwhile?

01:15.771 --> 01:16.946
Rehabilitation-wise?

01:16.989 --> 01:19.079
It's a huge
pain in my dick.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.558
We done, Spielsberg?

01:21.037 --> 01:22.734
You can state your name
whenever you're ready.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.736
Uh, Mary Jane LaFont.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.521
Call me MJ.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.697
I was making out with
someone in the hallway.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.307
Oh,
anyone's in particular? Or...

01:30.351 --> 01:32.440
Yes. Darren.

01:32.483 --> 01:36.139
My boyfriend of two years,
thank you very much.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.749
He's in detention
across the hall.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.403
That is what you
should do a story about.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.231
How the people in this town
are still just as Puritan

01:41.275 --> 01:43.190
as they were when they
murdered all of those witches.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.061
Oh no, that's actually
never been proven.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.018
The townspeople...
Okay. That's fine.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.237
Look, I'm just saying,

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
why separate the boys
from the girls?

01:49.283 --> 01:51.589
It is wicked sexist.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.505
Does detention work?

01:54.549 --> 01:56.203
Will you rethink your
actions in the future?

01:56.246 --> 01:57.291
No, he's my boyfriend,

01:57.334 --> 01:59.336
I'm gonna kiss him
when I want to.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.382
Besides, we're gonna
get married soon

02:01.425 --> 02:03.949
and put this whole state
in our rearview.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.125
Okay.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.387
Greta.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.780
Here because I ditched
AP Chem yesterday.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.131
And there's nothing
redeeming about detention.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.044
Why'd you skip
your class?

02:12.088 --> 02:13.176
Commitments...

02:13.220 --> 02:15.439
are more important
to me than neutrons.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.441
We had a game against
Westbrook last night,

02:17.485 --> 02:18.747
and I've got
a fullback sweeper

02:18.790 --> 02:20.444
who's been having
trouble with her flick.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.793
She was worried
since we wouldn't have

02:21.837 --> 02:23.621
much of a warm-up
given the drive to their field,

02:23.665 --> 02:26.233
so she asked if I could give
her a one-on-one refresher.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.104
Can you say that
in English?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.801
I'm captain of the
field hockey team.

02:29.845 --> 02:30.933
Those are hockey terms.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.630
Well, did we win?
Against Westbrook?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.066
Ms. Mclaskey?
No. The Ref was an idiot.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.111
Yeah?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.634
How much longer
will this take?

02:36.678 --> 02:38.288
Um, I have permission
from the principal

02:38.332 --> 02:39.420
to conduct these interviews

02:39.463 --> 02:41.291
And that's why
I'm allowing them.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.858
I asked you how long.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.773
Another twenty minutes?

02:44.816 --> 02:46.122
Make it five.
Okay.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
This shouldn't be
a social call.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.735
I'm pretty much done.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.998
Unless... you'd like
to say something.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.348
In the black hoodie.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.827
Sorry,
I don't know your name.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.046
Don't bother.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.135
She's new, and she doesn't
talk to anybody.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.399
She just creeps around being
all grim and premenstrual.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.619
I hear she worships Satan, too.

03:04.662 --> 03:05.620
Oh!

03:05.663 --> 03:06.795
Hi.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.057
I'm Jules.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.450
I'm a Leo.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.582
I think detention is
a great way to meet people.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.280
You're kidding, right?

03:13.323 --> 03:15.151
I'm also not new.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.980
I was born in Brunswick
and just moved back.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.809
My family's been part
of this town since, like,

03:20.852 --> 03:22.332
pre-Revolutionary War.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.291
What got in detention?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.640

03:26.684 --> 03:27.990
I call him "The Groper."

03:28.033 --> 03:30.122
He's been at it
since like the third grade.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.037
Yeah, he tried to
feel me up in Physics,

03:32.081 --> 03:33.474
so I pushed him.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.650
Wait, are you the reason
he's on crutches today?

03:35.693 --> 03:37.478
He's like over
two hundred pounds.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.219
How did you you push him?

03:39.523 --> 03:41.351
I just...

03:41.395 --> 03:42.787
believed I could.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.833
Are you a Scientologist?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.356
No.
I get it.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.053
It's like "The Secret"
type stuff.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.098
I've been telling
my teammates

03:49.141 --> 03:50.317
all about the law
of attraction...

03:50.360 --> 03:51.535
how it can help us
score more.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.189
All you--
Yeah, that's not it, either.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.192
You realize a girl like you
comes along every year, right?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.454
Trying to be a witch
in Brunswick

03:57.498 --> 03:59.935
is like wearing mouse ears
at Disney.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.023
Oooh.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.025
I'm not trying
to be anything.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.027
Mission accomplished.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.334
Look, if you're not
full of crap,

04:07.377 --> 04:09.161
why don't you put your
superpowers to good use

04:09.205 --> 04:10.554
and get us outta here.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.339

Don't do something crazy,

Over here please.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.300
So let me guess,

05:00.343 --> 05:02.084
you coordinated that with
one of your emo friends?

05:02.127 --> 05:03.651
Yeah, because I have
so many friends

05:03.694 --> 05:04.956
to plan stuff with.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.523
Then how did you do it?

05:06.567 --> 05:08.264
You should know.
You helped.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.178
You, too.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.397
Because we thought
you could?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.746
Um-hmm.
Exactly.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.138
You believed.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.923
Thoughts have power,
especially in a group.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.533
I've read about that theory.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.752
Like, how big groups
get together

05:17.795 --> 05:19.319
and meditate on peace

05:19.362 --> 05:21.886
and it briefly lowers
crime rates in the area.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.367
Yeah, there's people who
believe they can fly, too.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.760
And then they eat pavement.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.415
This is just messing
with your world-view, huh?

05:28.458 --> 05:30.982
I mean, it's warping your
skinny, rich-bitch mind.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.333
Okay, first of all,
thanks for calling me skinny.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.551
And secondly, no,

05:34.595 --> 05:36.292
I don't believe anything
magical happened.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.337
Okay, well I do

05:37.380 --> 05:38.425
and I wanna learn
how to do that.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.600
Like, can do that on my own?

05:39.643 --> 05:42.342

that stuff?

06:08.672 --> 06:10.370
If you're serious.
I can try.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.284
But it's more religion
than hobby,

06:12.328 --> 06:13.764
and it's not for everyone.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.636
You said we could be more
powerful in a group, right?

At Hag's Rock.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.207
Midnight.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.295
And it has
to be midnight,

06:23.339 --> 06:24.819
because that's so much
"witchier."

06:24.862 --> 06:26.821
Midnight is transitional.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.257
And Hag's Rock is special

06:28.300 --> 06:30.433
because the places where
people were brutally killed

06:30.477 --> 06:32.653
can hold onto
residual energy.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.202
Something with my hands.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.856
Looks del-licious, mom.
Good. Dig in.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.336
How'd I ever let myself
get caught up in

07:47.379 --> 07:49.207
network administration?

07:50.339 --> 07:52.341
Take it from me, girls--
Emily,

07:52.384 --> 07:55.039
Don't let fear stop you from doing things.
did you wash your hands?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.998
She didn't.
Try everything once.

detention

08:19.760 --> 08:21.849

You're the last one up.

Okay. I'll set the alarm.

What is wrong with you?

08:58.842 --> 09:00.104
Sorry.
Did I frighten you

09:00.148 --> 09:01.584
on your way
to becoming a witch?

09:01.628 --> 09:03.760
I was just... out...

09:03.804 --> 09:05.457
walking.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.851
Very close to
Merrymeeting Park.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.462
Well I was curious
if anyone would show.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.552
Well, let's be
curious together.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.208
No, thanks.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.253
What's your deal,
Miss Priss?

09:18.296 --> 09:19.733
You live life
through a camera?

09:19.776 --> 09:22.431
I report things,
perhaps you've heard of it?

09:22.474 --> 09:24.259
I remember you,
by the way.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.652
Weren't you that girl
in sixth grade

09:25.695 --> 09:27.044
who wrote our congressman

09:27.088 --> 09:29.612
and got like bullet proof
vests for police dogs?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.483
Why would you
remember that?

09:31.527 --> 09:33.485
Because I thought
it was cool.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.226
I'm not a sandpaper tampon,
you know.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.315
I don't know.
We've never spoken.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.448
But I bet
you've heard things.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.884
Oh, come on.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.974
Hearing the rumors about me
is one of my few joys.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.628
I heard you got a nose job

09:45.672 --> 09:47.761
the summer before
freshman year.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.154
Best money
my dad ever spent.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.635
Does he make a lot?

09:52.679 --> 09:55.377
Whatever he makes now
he spends on his new family.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.987
My mom got
a pretty huge settlement,

09:57.031 --> 10:00.077
but she like pretty much drank
the entire thing away, so...

10:00.121 --> 10:01.513
I'm sorry.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.690
You're not pouring
chardonnay down her throat.

Well either way,

interested in this?

10:11.001 --> 10:13.221
Even if it's a big
cauldron of BS,

10:13.264 --> 10:15.179
it'll make a good story.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.572
And if it's not...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.922
I'll be able to slap hexes
on the people I hate.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.924
Oooh.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.100
So it is happening.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.015
Yep.
Right on.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.930
It's this or Netflix.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.715
Well get in.

Oh, she's harmless.

Can we make
Columbine jokes now?

10:42.729 --> 10:43.904
It's ten after.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.601
Either we missed the
world's shortest ritual,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.037
or the stupid witch
lied to us.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.735
You're late.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.562
What did we miss,
organic farming?

10:51.868 --> 10:53.391
Claire, I'm okay
with you filming this,

10:53.435 --> 10:55.480
but only if you participate.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.396

11:07.057 --> 11:08.493
Or leave.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.844

11:26.555 --> 11:29.166
Looks kinda...
Satanic.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.777
Satanists use
the pentagram

11:30.820 --> 11:32.909
with its two points up,

11:32.953 --> 11:35.390
representing devil's horns.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.741
Which is why people think
that witches worship Satan...

11:38.785 --> 11:40.308
they're looking at it wrong.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.179
From where I'm standing,

11:42.223 --> 11:44.965
it symbolizes the four
primal elements

11:45.008 --> 11:46.227
earth,

11:47.315 --> 11:48.882
wind,

11:48.925 --> 11:50.448
fire,

11:50.492 --> 11:51.754
and water.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.843
What's the fifth?
School spirit?

11:53.887 --> 11:56.019
You're actually close
for once.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.804
It's just Spirit,

11:57.847 --> 11:59.893
it represents those
who've lived before us

11:59.936 --> 12:01.808
and passed on...

12:01.851 --> 12:04.593
since their energy can
never truly be extinguished.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.334
Grab a tool

12:06.377 --> 12:09.163
and dig a hole
at one of the five points.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.078
Then we'll cut off
a lock of hair,

12:11.121 --> 12:12.819
and bury it as an offering.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.256
I don't think
extensions count.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.127
Um, I don't think
you count.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.568
I came up here in fifth grade
once for a field trip.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.179
Oh yeah.
Me too.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.485
Hold still.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.926
Is anyone else

12:35.276 --> 12:36.799

have been in my family

12:36.843 --> 12:37.931

12:37.974 --> 12:39.976
What are those?
Spells?

12:40.411 --> 12:41.935
Two chants.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.328
One of which we'll do tonight,
is called "Bonding."

12:44.676 --> 12:46.940
It's a way of sealing a group
of like-minded souls.

12:46.983 --> 12:47.941
Hate to break it to you,

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
but we couldn't
be more different.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.814
We're all here,
aren't we?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.121
What do you mean chants?

12:54.164 --> 12:56.297
Words we say in unison.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.473
It's a way of focusing
a coven's intention.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.215
Is that what we are?
A coven?

13:01.258 --> 13:02.477
Not yet.

13:17.622 --> 13:18.928
Are these like,
Girl Scout cookies

13:18.972 --> 13:20.582
or did you get them
from the store?

13:21.539 --> 13:23.193
I think just from the store.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.760

Doesn't say.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.546
Maybe it's dumb to wait.
Maybe it's not that literal.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
Well, Claire?

13:30.244 --> 13:31.245
You said that the town

13:31.288 --> 13:32.899
didn't really burn
witches here?

13:32.942 --> 13:34.552
From what I've read,
yeah.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.164
It's well documented
that these woods were used

13:37.207 --> 13:40.123
as a meeting place for Pagan
and Wiccan ritual practices,

13:40.167 --> 13:41.995
hence the term,
Merrymeeting Park.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.997
Did you just say
"hence"?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.999
And it's true that
several women died here

13:46.042 --> 13:49.698
in late 1600's,
pre Salem Witch Trials.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.832
But diaries of the town Pastor
and local officials

13:52.875 --> 13:55.486
say that they were
found dead at Hag's Rock.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.010
And history remembers
them as witches

13:57.053 --> 13:59.708
when they were probably just,
like, outspoken women.

13:59.751 --> 14:00.927
Right?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.145
Like, they just mentioned
to the mens folk

14:02.189 --> 14:03.712
a few things that
could've been run better

14:03.755 --> 14:05.018
around town and then...
whuddya know...

14:05.061 --> 14:07.194
were later found decapitated.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.718
I always try to remember
the one bright spot.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.459
Mary Perkins.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.548
She was found
among the dead...

14:13.591 --> 14:15.767
cold and shivering with
rope burns around her neck

14:15.811 --> 14:17.291
but she was still alive.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.466
Really?

14:18.509 --> 14:19.641
I don't know about her.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.512
Well did she ever
say what happened?

14:21.556 --> 14:22.774
No.
She was unable to speak

14:22.818 --> 14:24.559
because of the damage
to her throat,

14:24.602 --> 14:27.562
so they jailed her
for the murders.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.912
Later she escaped
and blamed the town.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.610
Said they tried to form a mob
and tried to kill them.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.656
I'm with her.
This town blows.

has become the hunted.

15:05.817 --> 15:06.862
You're not filming over

15:06.906 --> 15:07.994

15:12.737 --> 15:14.478
Uh, it's kinda
become a bigger deal.

for a Pulitzer Prize,

15:16.654 --> 15:17.873
but we have a quota--
Give it.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.920
Eating alone.
Mm-hmm.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.965
Is this by choice?

15:23.009 --> 15:25.185
Everything you say
sounds like a news teaser.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.926
Dining solo...

15:26.969 --> 15:28.275
Is it weird for you
to be back?

15:28.318 --> 15:30.625
I mean, are any of your
friends still around?

15:30.668 --> 15:32.148
Nah, it's been too long.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.237
Well, you could've
sat with me.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.500
I'm okay with
not having friends.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.634
You're in my History class,
right?

15:39.677 --> 15:41.897
Mrs. Fuller's?
Mm-hmm.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.377
That's awful,

15:43.420 --> 15:46.728
especially since I pride myself
on being observant.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.860
To be fair...
this is a new do.

15:48.904 --> 15:49.992
Okay, so someone
must have been

15:50.036 --> 15:51.820
screwing with us
last night, right?

15:51.863 --> 15:53.256
How did they know
where to dig?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.737
Uh, they were watching us
from the woods.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.482

deemed worthy,

16:02.831 --> 16:04.224
our offerings would then be--

What's so important you
can't sit with me, babe?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.532
Just leave it.
Give it.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.449
You plannin' some kinda
medieval surprise party for me?

16:12.493 --> 16:13.711
Hand it over.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.513

Okay. Awesome.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.080
Well I feel super dumb.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.125
What a douche.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.735
You better not
mean my Darren.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.389
What if I do?

16:40.347 --> 16:41.565
Hey Brooke,
you wanna sit with me?

16:41.609 --> 16:43.219
No, I have
a seat already.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.916
You guys,
here comes Brooke.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.876
It's like, you're obviously
horrific looking.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.660
Why do you think
you can speak to me?

16:49.704 --> 16:51.271
Brooke, what do you
think happened last night?

16:51.314 --> 16:53.099
I know what happened.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.404
it worked.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.363
Right?

16:56.406 --> 16:58.321
Mm-hmm.
Our offers were accepted.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.323
So what happens now?

17:00.367 --> 17:02.673
The second chant is called
"Commencement."

17:02.717 --> 17:04.240
There's nothing else on there?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.546
It's torn off.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.547
I mean, there might have
been something, but...

17:06.589 --> 17:09.506
So let's do it,
let's commence.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.811
Do you wanna sit?

17:10.855 --> 17:13.118
No.
I have an image to protect.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.555
But we can use my house.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.078
My mom will be out.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.426
Eleven pm?

17:17.471 --> 17:18.733
Can't we just
meet after school?

17:18.776 --> 17:21.040
Sneaking out really
isn't easy for me.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.214
I got a game,

17:22.258 --> 17:23.520
then after that all
the varsity teams

17:23.564 --> 17:25.914
are decorating the gym
for the Spring Fling.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.525

What? C'mon.

17:28.569 --> 17:29.918
I'm sorry,
am I the only one

17:29.961 --> 17:32.442
who couldn't sleep
last night?

17:32.486 --> 17:35.228
I thought this is
something I wanted but...

17:35.271 --> 17:36.577
I'm sorry.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.969
So, you're just pussing out?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.363
Look, I don't know
where it comes from.

17:40.407 --> 17:41.190
The magic.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.235
I don't want to be in league

17:42.278 --> 17:43.671
with like some demon
or something.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.107
You're not.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.718

All around.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.767

The sky.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.421
Even spirits of past witches.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.945
So ghosts?
That's comforting.

17:56.988 --> 18:00.122
Look, MJ, I can't
tell you not to bail,

18:00.166 --> 18:03.082
but we're bonded now.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.474
If you decide
not to commence,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.433
then there is no coven.

into becoming a witch.

to disappoint anyone.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.638
She's already paid.
She's already paid--

25:52.681 --> 25:54.378
Hey!
Oh no.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.251
You wanna get coffee
sometime, or...?

25:57.730 --> 25:59.253
No, sorry.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.124

26:01.168 --> 26:03.474
Ladies,
what's with all the bags?

26:03.518 --> 26:04.737
You guys win a contest?

26:04.780 --> 26:06.913
No, people just
like giving us things.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.479
Have you talked to MJ?

26:08.523 --> 26:09.698
She's in a world of hurt.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.961
Had a double root canal
and a bridge.

26:12.005 --> 26:13.484
Oh, no,

26:13.528 --> 26:17.010
I guess we didn't think
to follow up with her.

26:18.838 --> 26:19.926
Rolling?

26:19.969 --> 26:21.841
Okay, My lipstick
is Makeup Forever

26:21.884 --> 26:24.757
and in my hair is Amika's
Undone texture spray.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.324
And my handkerchief dress is--
What're you doing?

26:27.368 --> 26:30.110
Um, hello?
Making a haul video.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.590
You don't do
a spree like this

26:31.633 --> 26:33.374
without putting it up
on YouTube--
Miss Cabot.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.637
Here we are again.

26:35.681 --> 26:36.943
Since you're so
talkative today,

26:36.986 --> 26:38.858
why don't you give
the class an example

26:38.901 --> 26:41.643
of Edgar Allen Poe's
"Single Effect?" Please.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.036
Sure.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.559
He was such
a creepy mo-fo.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.562
that it effected his dating life
and he stayed single.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.824
That's clever.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.783
That's really clever,
but your witticisms

26:50.826 --> 26:52.785
aren't going to help you
on the mid-term.

26:53.350 --> 26:55.788
Poe basically thought
stories were best when

26:55.831 --> 26:58.617
they achieved a single emotional 
effect on the reader.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.401
That's correct, Ms. Mclaskey.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.577
Again, thank you very much.

27:04.231 --> 27:07.538
Brooke, I'm wondering
what you're going to do,

27:07.582 --> 27:10.237
when your smarter friend
isn't around to help you?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.850
Now I'm gonna read from
"Masque of the Red Death,"

27:14.894 --> 27:17.331
I want you guys to pay close
attention to the signposts.

27:17.374 --> 27:18.593
Okay?
Stay out of it.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.160
I just wanted him
off your back.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.204
You only made it worse.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.380
Good? No?
Great.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.644
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.
-"No pestilence has ever been so fatal.

27:25.687 --> 27:29.038
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.519
Dwyer's a coffeemouth.
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.

27:31.562 --> 27:34.000
"Blood was its avatar
and its seal--
Dwyer's a coffeemouth.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.002
Dwyer's a coffeemouth.
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.482
Dwyer's a coffee-mouth.
The redness and the horror
of blood..."

27:38.526 --> 27:41.616
Dwyer's a coffeemouth.

Um...
"There were sharp pains,

27:53.062 --> 27:57.110
Oh my God.
and there were sudden
bleeding at the pores--"

27:57.588 --> 27:59.112
Poe's single effect.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.462
I heard about this all the
way on the tennis courts.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.594
I almost felt bad for him.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.292
Claire.
It's Dwyer.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.816
I mean, I hear he's some kind
of shell-shocked exMarine.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.296
Yeah.
He hates my guts,

28:09.339 --> 28:10.601
and he's my advisor, too.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.038
So he's literally doing
everything in his power

28:12.081 --> 28:13.866
to make sure I end up
working at McDonalds.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.695
Oh no.
Enjoying the plight of Dwyer?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.348
I just came from
the nurse's office.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.524
He's not vomiting up
Folgers anymore.

28:20.568 --> 28:21.482
That's good.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.484
How are you?
I'm okay.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.920
My teeth went ape-shit.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.574
Yeah, we heard.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.490
But, hey,
how are you guys?

28:30.404 --> 28:32.754
Miss a day
and miss a lot, huh?

28:32.798 --> 28:35.714
Raiding the Old Port
actually sounds pretty rad.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.716
Wish I could've been there.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.456
But apparently we don't need
all of us together

28:39.500 --> 28:41.589
to do spells or whatever.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.331
Yeah.
Just two of you did Dwyer.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.463
I think we're each capable
of harnessing the power

28:46.507 --> 28:48.465
of the entire coven now.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.684
At any time.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.773
Brett Harlow asked me to
the Spring Fling.

28:51.817 --> 28:52.861
Shut the front door.
What?

28:52.905 --> 28:54.297
Is that something
you chanted for?

28:54.341 --> 28:56.778
No. I beat him at tennis
during gym class

28:56.822 --> 28:58.432
and then when
we shook hands after,

28:58.475 --> 28:59.650
he asked me.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.130
I figured he was gay...

29:01.174 --> 29:02.436
he never looks at me.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.917
Uh, he's like,
Beiber-licious.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.309
You know what,
no, no,

29:06.353 --> 29:08.355
I actually think he's prettier
than Justin Beebs.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.009
Alright, witches.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.054
We all have things
that we all want, right?

29:12.098 --> 29:14.056
And I'm not just talking
about shopping anymore.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.318
I think this group
should be about

29:15.362 --> 29:17.320
helping each other
get what we want.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.627
So let's meet tonight
with lists.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.021
Let me guess, midnight?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.731
Greta's pretty good, huh?

29:37.863 --> 29:39.081
She's great.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.387
I never cared about
any of our sports

29:40.430 --> 29:42.389
because I never knew
any of the players.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.827
Hey, uh
I'm walkin' home.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.524
Wanna join?

29:47.568 --> 29:49.831
Has the town changed a lot
since you were last here?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.703
Yeah,
somehow its even lamer.

29:52.747 --> 29:55.489
What does that say
about me that I like it?

29:55.532 --> 29:57.056
It says that you're
a Labra-Doodle.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.579
<font color="#FFFF00">(BOTH LAUGH)</font>

29:59.101 --> 30:01.016
Hold up.
Say that again?

30:01.060 --> 30:02.757
Not while you're recording.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.021
Claire just explained to me
why witches ride brooms.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.284
A theory I read.
That's all.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.808
They were drug addicts?

30:09.851 --> 30:12.419
Okay, there's this mold

30:12.462 --> 30:14.508
that grows on
really old rye bread.

30:14.551 --> 30:17.032
And if you eat it,
you hallucinate,

30:17.076 --> 30:19.730
but if you swallow too much,
than you'll die.

30:19.774 --> 30:23.038
So to get the fun effects
without the danger,

30:23.082 --> 30:26.041
you can let it seep through
your bloodstream via...

30:26.085 --> 30:27.173
another area.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.349
Oh, like your vagina!

<font color="#FFFF00">(NERVOUS LAUGHING)</font>

30:32.265 --> 30:34.876
Well they may have
wiped the mold

30:34.920 --> 30:37.052
on things like
broom handles,

30:37.096 --> 30:40.099
and rubbed it
between their legs.

30:40.926 --> 30:44.016
Hence the reports
of ladies in fields

30:44.059 --> 30:45.495
"riding" their brooms.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.019
Gross.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.760
I'd at least have the decency
to do that indoors.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.762
So, what happens if
your parents catch you

30:51.806 --> 30:53.329
sneaking out at night?

30:53.373 --> 30:56.115
That would be really creepy
because they're both dead.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.074
Oh, man.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.771
Open mouth, insert foot.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.948
Nah.
It's ancient history.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.385
At the moment I'm living
with foster parents who are--

31:06.299 --> 31:08.344
Get off her!
What're you doing?

31:09.041 --> 31:10.651
Let me go.
Hey!

31:12.522 --> 31:14.263
Oh.
Let's make sure
she's not following us.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.874
What the hell was that?

<font color="#FFFF00">(NERVOUS LAUGH)</font>

31:18.920 --> 31:21.401
That was insane?
Should we call the cops?

31:21.444 --> 31:23.446
How is it,
are you okay?

31:23.490 --> 31:26.449
Yeah, just...
freaked out.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.712
How'd you do that?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.279
I dunno.
I just...

31:30.323 --> 31:32.716
wanted her away from you
and suddenly she was.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.501
Wow. Reflex.

31:34.544 --> 31:35.067
Yeah.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.678
1971.
Stanford University.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.985
An experiment, divided
students into two groups,

31:40.028 --> 31:41.769
prisoners and guards.

31:41.812 --> 31:44.337
Those acting as guards
soon became so abusive,

31:44.380 --> 31:46.208
the experiment was terminated.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.775
What would stop the
same thing from happening,

31:47.818 --> 31:49.908
say, to a teacher
asked to preside over

31:49.951 --> 31:51.605
high school detention?

31:51.648 --> 31:53.520
The psychologist
who created the experiment,

31:53.563 --> 31:54.956
was quoted as saying,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.610
"Only a few people
were able to resist

31:56.653 --> 31:58.090
"the situational temptations

31:58.133 --> 32:00.309
to yield to power
and dominance."

32:00.353 --> 32:02.094
Ha!

32:02.137 --> 32:04.531
Remember our talk,
about knocking?

32:04.574 --> 32:05.793
My name is Emily,

32:05.836 --> 32:08.839
and I enjoy l-l-long
walks on the b-beach.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.363

32:10.406 --> 32:12.974
A-are you m-m-making
a sex-tape?

32:13.018 --> 32:15.759
No! You're gross.
Get out!

32:17.109 --> 32:19.024
I see Claire's working,

32:19.067 --> 32:20.199
have you done
your homework?

32:20.242 --> 32:22.244
Kinda.
N-no.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.463
Go.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.160
Yeah, go.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.815
I'll g-get you in your sleep.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.382
Are you pulling
another late one?

32:29.425 --> 32:30.861
Have to.

32:31.166 --> 32:32.559
Hey, um...

32:32.602 --> 32:34.953
could they've
messed up my glasses?

32:34.996 --> 32:36.171
What're you talking about?

32:36.215 --> 32:38.130
At the lens place
or whatever?

32:38.826 --> 32:39.870
Why?

32:40.393 --> 32:42.090
Why's she waiting outside?

32:42.569 --> 32:43.918
Hey girl, what's up?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.094
We need a new locale.

32:46.138 --> 32:48.140
My mom's has that same
ass-clown over again.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.880
Gross.
Get your ass in the car.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.058
Okay, lists.
Who has one?

32:53.101 --> 32:55.060
Jules?
Now you're filming, too?
Mm-hmm.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.626
You created a monster.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.237
Just read your list.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.586
Okay.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.849
Number one.
Darren proposes to me.

33:01.892 --> 33:02.981
Aw.
Aw. C'mon.

33:03.024 --> 33:03.851
What!?

33:03.894 --> 33:05.026
He's gonna do that anyway!

33:05.070 --> 33:06.462
I don't know.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.247
He's talkin' about
the Army after school.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.292
Life could pull him
in all sorts of directions.

33:10.336 --> 33:13.034
That's not a bad thing.
That's life.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.384
You said make a list!

33:15.428 --> 33:16.690
What else is on there?

33:16.733 --> 33:18.039
Thank you.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.607
Thighs.

33:20.650 --> 33:21.695
Butt.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.045
Boobs.
That's the big one.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.048
Okay, I got food.
Y'all witches ready to eat?

33:27.222 --> 33:28.963
I wanna beat
Westbrook tomorrow.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.704
Won't that happen anyway?

33:30.747 --> 33:33.489
They got this new goalie.
She's like a brick wall.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.318
But if we beat them, we can
make it all the way to State.

33:36.362 --> 33:40.018
Oh, and another thing,
I want a new car.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.237
Since I keep driving around
this cracker-ass coven

33:42.281 --> 33:44.065
like some kinda
Driving Miss Daisy sequel.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.197
They have their own trailer,

33:45.240 --> 33:47.503
and they feed them like,
filet mignon.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.810
So what if, on the way
to one of these shows,

33:49.853 --> 33:52.465
the Dobermans just...
turned on her?

33:52.508 --> 33:53.553
Bit her in the face?

33:53.596 --> 33:55.207
I'm not chanting
for show dogs

33:55.250 --> 33:56.817
to kill your dad's girlfriend.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.297
Who said kill?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.951
I'm just talking a few nips
to the head and neck,

34:00.995 --> 34:02.301
some light scarring,

34:02.344 --> 34:04.129
maybe a temporary
eye patch.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.218
I also want my mom
to lay off the booze.

34:06.261 --> 34:07.958
It's outta control.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.222
...Turn this thing on?
Oh, wait I got it.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.746
Claire,
you're such a girl scout!

34:12.789 --> 34:13.746
What?

34:13.790 --> 34:14.965
Oh, come on.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.532
Nothing for yourself?

34:16.576 --> 34:18.056
Just a job for dear 'ol dad

34:18.099 --> 34:19.405
and no stuttering
for little sister?

34:20.971 --> 34:22.408

my life better.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.714
And it's these two things,
trust me.

34:24.757 --> 34:27.195
Jules, how about you?
What do you want?

34:27.239 --> 34:29.284
First thing on my list
is to fly.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.815

It's never someone like me.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.431
It's always some
stuck-up bulimic bitch.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.303
Um, it was me last year?

34:48.998 --> 34:51.437
But you really think
I could pass for bulimic?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.134
Wow.
Thank you.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.442
I just think it'd be cool
for people on the fringes.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.487
That'd be a big spell,
right?

34:58.531 --> 34:59.967
The entire school
would have to think

35:00.010 --> 35:01.621
you're the best candidate.

35:02.578 --> 35:03.840
That doesn't feel right.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.408

a date rape drug.

And we've proven that
it doesn't take all of us

35:13.328 --> 35:16.244
to make stuff happen,
so I can go.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.724
No, don't be like that.

things that I think

35:19.160 --> 35:20.161

35:20.205 --> 35:21.467

35:21.510 --> 35:24.687

I at least propose
that if anyone has a any

Hey, when the keg's dry,
is that it?

43:03.406 --> 43:04.973
Or is there a secret
stash somewhere?

43:05.017 --> 43:06.366
I'm sure somebody's
got something.

43:06.409 --> 43:07.933

43:09.761 --> 43:11.632
Hey. No.

43:11.676 --> 43:12.851
Yeah, same.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.330

Nope, even worse.

45:01.263 --> 45:02.351
...Much of what
they have today,

45:02.395 --> 45:04.789
is because they
snatched up farms,

45:04.832 --> 45:06.878
and the homes,
and the labor of people

afford to pay their loans.

45:32.033 --> 45:34.166
Yes. And it's going
to stay that way.

45:34.209 --> 45:36.603
We're on public property,
so I don't need to--That's okay.

45:36.646 --> 45:39.693
It's about time I got on

45:39.737 --> 45:43.566
So, you girls were shopping
in the Old Port last Saturday,

45:43.610 --> 45:46.831
you left Kurier with some
new handbags and clothing.

45:46.874 --> 45:49.485
Would you happen
to have the receipts?

45:49.529 --> 45:51.923
Is there a problem
with them?

45:53.272 --> 45:56.275
Security footage shows
you just... walking out.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.842
Not paying.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.582
What about the cashier?

45:59.626 --> 46:01.193
He says you paid.

46:01.236 --> 46:02.760
Because we did.

46:04.413 --> 46:05.545
Cash or credit?

46:05.588 --> 46:07.242
Credit.
Cash.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.899
The drawer came up short,

46:11.943 --> 46:13.683
and the owner's
a friend of mine.

46:13.727 --> 46:15.163
Let me get this straight?

46:15.207 --> 46:17.339
If you're tight with
some local detective,

46:17.383 --> 46:19.124
you can have girls harassed

46:19.167 --> 46:21.517
because of
a bookkeeping issue?

46:21.561 --> 46:24.129
See, now I'm surprised
this is unpleasant.

46:24.172 --> 46:26.000
I thought you'd
clear this up quickly.

46:26.044 --> 46:28.133
It's perfectly clear.

46:28.176 --> 46:29.874
We paid.

is if you feel
the same way?

46:47.805 --> 46:49.197
What?

46:49.241 --> 46:52.200
I know some
might say it's wrong,

46:52.244 --> 46:55.377
but in my eyes, Brooke...

46:55.421 --> 46:57.118
you can do no wrong.

believe what he'd done.

47:18.139 --> 47:19.401

I was just leaving.

52:57.957 --> 53:00.220
I just left Greta's
and I'm having this feeling.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.353
Like I'm being watched.

53:02.396 --> 53:04.355
I don't know if it's from
talking to the detective or--

53:04.398 --> 53:05.617
Hey.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.227
What the--
Were you following me?

53:07.271 --> 53:08.620
No. I know you live
around here,

53:08.663 --> 53:10.448
I was actually hoping
to run into you.

53:10.491 --> 53:12.711
Hey, can I say something?

53:12.754 --> 53:14.191
Can I say something
off the record?

53:14.234 --> 53:15.975
This helps me maintain
an emotional distance.

53:16.018 --> 53:17.498
So let's keep it that way.

53:17.542 --> 53:20.327
Look, what happened
at the lake last night...

53:20.371 --> 53:22.199
that was a surprise
to me, too. Okay?

53:22.242 --> 53:24.331
My plan was to actually
see if you'd be my date

53:24.375 --> 53:26.377
to the Spring Fling
tomorrow night.

53:26.725 --> 53:29.206
Terrible timing.
I'm now a lesbian.

53:30.381 --> 53:32.383
Is that's supposed
to be a deterrent?

53:32.426 --> 53:34.123
Look, okay,

53:34.167 --> 53:36.169
I won't get into
who kissed who first,

53:36.213 --> 53:38.737
it was dumb,
and I regret it.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.608
Would you give me a chance
to make it up to you?

53:40.652 --> 53:43.089
Look, you seem like a great guy but--
Uh-oh.

53:43.132 --> 53:45.265
That's like starting a sentence,
"With all due respect."

53:45.309 --> 53:46.658
But I'm just,

53:46.701 --> 53:48.747
I'm dealing with a lot
of heavy stuff right now.

53:48.790 --> 53:50.227
Anything I can lift for you?

53:50.270 --> 53:51.445
I've seen the way
you pick things up,

53:51.489 --> 53:53.491
so no thanks.

53:53.534 --> 53:56.929
Well, if you get your stuff
figured out by tomorrow,

53:56.972 --> 53:58.235
call me?

53:58.278 --> 53:59.801
Please?

53:59.845 --> 54:01.586
Pretty please?

to go away.

54:03.631 --> 54:05.372
For everything
to return to normal.

54:05.416 --> 54:07.113
And where does the energy
for that spell come from?

54:07.156 --> 54:09.420
I mean, it could
make us sicker, right?

54:09.463 --> 54:11.030
We go to Hag's Rock tonight,

54:11.073 --> 54:12.814
because it's
a powerful place...

54:12.858 --> 54:16.296
and we chant to diminish
just Brooke's ability.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.993
Yeah, I just...
I don't know.

54:20.169 --> 54:22.215
There has to be a way
to unlink ourselves,

54:22.259 --> 54:24.478
to reverse the bonding.

54:24.522 --> 54:26.611
You really don't trust Brooke?

54:26.654 --> 54:28.265
I do actually

54:28.308 --> 54:30.789
and she was very clear
about not stopping

54:30.832 --> 54:34.532
and doing anything
to keep her powers.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.013
if someone came into this

55:21.056 --> 55:23.668
How did Hoover respond
to the Great Depression?

55:23.711 --> 55:25.060
Well he did a few things.

55:25.104 --> 55:26.497
One was a big PR move.

55:26.540 --> 55:28.237
He downplayed public fears

55:28.281 --> 55:30.588
by keeping confidence
in the economy up

55:30.631 --> 55:32.938
and then he tried to get
across this idea of...

not happening?

01:02:37.405 --> 01:02:38.972
She'll see you now.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:44.978
Some wild reports from
the village center tonight.

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:47.938
Lot like the calls I heard
come in seventeen years ago.

01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:52.812
So why the sudden interest
in those girls I mentioned?

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.683
You said it ended badly?

01:02:55.554 --> 01:02:57.382
Three of them are dead...

01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:59.819
the other two missing,
presumed dead.

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.908
There were five of them.
Like us.

01:03:02.996 --> 01:03:05.172
Hey, any clearer ones of her?

01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:06.521
Not really.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:08.785
There's that...
and this one.

01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:12.049
Abby Butcher.
One of the missing.

01:03:12.092 --> 01:03:14.355
I tried to get more
info from next of kin,

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:16.401
but she was
a foster kid and frankly,

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:19.447
nobody seemed to care
that she was gone, so...

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:22.233
It's been a cold case
around here

01:03:22.276 --> 01:03:23.800
for everyone but me.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.584
So why do you
stick with it?

01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:27.238
It's my job.

01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:34.811
That's Lisa Strauss.

01:03:34.854 --> 01:03:36.595
She's been missing
since 1983,

01:03:36.638 --> 01:03:38.858
when she got involved
with another group of girls

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.252
who used to gather up
at Hag's Rock.

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:43.471
She's a Strauss, too?

01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:44.951
She's my older sister.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.866
Isn't that, like,
a conflict of interest

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.302
or something?

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:50.739
Would you rather no one
be working on this case?

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:52.089
Guess I'm okay with it.

01:03:52.132 --> 01:03:53.438
Well that's a load off.

01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:55.962
Hey, take away
this bad haircut

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.269
and replace it with
a try-hard hombre dye job,

01:03:58.312 --> 01:03:59.531
and who do you have?

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:00.749
What?

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:01.925
She would've been,
a baby back then.

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:03.491
Okay, who're we
talking about, here?

01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:05.015
Our friend Jules.

01:04:05.058 --> 01:04:07.669
Well "Friend"
is an overstatement.

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:10.020
The three girls who died,
they...

01:04:10.063 --> 01:04:11.499
Poison.

01:04:11.543 --> 01:04:13.893
We sent blood samples
to the forensic labs upstate,

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.287
they pinpointed a rare
type of mold

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:18.767
that I don't believe
they ate accidentally.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:20.900
Huh?

01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:23.381
Does, that mean
something to you?

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.173
If the principal
ever finds out I let you in,

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.740
there go my privileges.

01:04:34.783 --> 01:04:35.959
I wouldn't have gotten
you out of bed

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:37.743
if this weren't really
important.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:39.658
Well there's no use
in my going back home now,

01:04:39.701 --> 01:04:41.834
so is there anything
I can help you with?

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.445
We need our yearbook
from seventeen years ago.

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:47.100
Look out for any blurry
photos of her, too.

01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.493
That could easily be a spell.

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:49.886
Here we go.

01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:52.236
Who does this
look like to you?

01:04:52.279 --> 01:04:53.193
Whoa?

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.499
Claire,
that name you gave me,

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:55.500
is that a joke?

01:04:55.543 --> 01:04:56.762
Why?

01:04:56.805 --> 01:04:58.807
Well Abby Butcher
is an old Brunswick name.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:00.722
So old
that this list came up.

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:06.250
Women found dead
in Merrymeeting Park in 1689.

01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:08.861
That can't be...
the name in the middle.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.341
Julia Sutton.

01:05:10.384 --> 01:05:12.430
Isn't that the same--
Whoa, what picture is that?

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:15.172
It's a woodcut depicting
the supposed rituals

01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:16.434
at Merrymeeting.

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:17.696
Can you
cross-reference that list

01:05:17.739 --> 01:05:18.697
with students enrolled here?

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.177
Holy crap.

01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:22.831
Look who was Flower Queen
seventeen years ago.

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.529
Abby F'ing Butcher.

01:05:24.572 --> 01:05:25.834
Oh my gosh.

01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:28.359
Here she is again.
In 1966.

01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:30.535
Using the name
Susannah Martin.

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.755
This is our oldest one,
from 1932.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.801
And here's a girl
named Martha Carrier,

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:38.891
same name as one of the
accused Brunswick witches.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.414
Similar features.

01:05:41.372 --> 01:05:42.764
I'm confused.

01:05:42.808 --> 01:05:44.636
What do these girls
have in common?

01:05:45.463 --> 01:05:48.596
They might be
the same person.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.643
They might even be a witch

01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:53.906
who is three-hundred
plus years old.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.866
One who returns to Brunswick
every seventeen years

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:02.480
and uses the names of her
original victims as aliases.

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:04.308
This is a show
you've been binging

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:06.397
or this is real life?

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.355
Wanna see something sad?

01:06:08.399 --> 01:06:10.531
A dedication page for the
other girl who went missing

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:12.185
seventeen years ago.

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:13.273
Sarah Gould.

01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.058
What the...?
Easy.

01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:16.059
What's up?

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.539
She's not missing.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:26.069
Have you been here
all night?

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:30.725
Brought you your cup of sugar
with a splash of coffee.

01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:32.336
Just like you like it.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:39.082
Just gonna leave it
right here for ya.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.653
Good talk.

01:06:50.093 --> 01:06:51.311
Gross.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:52.660
What are we even
doing here?

01:06:52.704 --> 01:06:55.228
Hey, pretty ladies
got a dollar?

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:56.838
Sorry.
Fresh out.

01:06:56.882 --> 01:06:58.188
Whores.

01:06:58.449 --> 01:06:59.841
That bodes well.

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:02.496
Sarah?

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.411
Can we just go?

01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:05.934
If we get back the end
of first period,

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:07.414
no even know we left.

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:08.981
Why don't we just skip?

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.591
It might be better if everyone
thinks we're missing.

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:13.072
Don't have to ask me twice.
I love playing hooky.

01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:19.774
Sarah?

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:23.430
Sarah, hey,
can we talk to you?

01:07:23.474 --> 01:07:24.953
Please.

01:07:25.302 --> 01:07:27.739
"Does she know..."
Who, Jules?

01:07:27.782 --> 01:07:28.653
Abby?

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.090
No.
We're alone.

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:33.049
It's just us.
Honest.

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.182
Here, I'll take it.

01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:37.966
Those chants
didn't form a coven?

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.533
They did something else?

01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:44.712
That's how she stays young?

01:07:44.756 --> 01:07:46.062
She comes back
every seventeen years

01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:47.498
to replenish herself?

01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:48.716
The magic's making us sick,

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.501
is that how you lost
your voice?

01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:52.981
How was your face burnt?

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:57.812
Jeez.
How can we reverse it?

01:07:57.856 --> 01:07:59.640
Is there anything
we can do?

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:04.471
Crown her?
Wasn't planning on it.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:05.820
Brooke.
At the Spring Fling.

01:08:05.864 --> 01:08:07.518
They do crown
the Flower Queen.

01:08:10.564 --> 01:08:12.697
If we don't stop her,
she can make this permanent.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:15.178
Yeah, she'll use us up
and throw us away.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.093

when the cops come.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:23.490
Not if we also plan
on stopping Jules.

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.144
Oh, man, I never even saw her.

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:26.885
Oh God.

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:29.670
There's nothing Strauss
can do to help.

01:08:29.714 --> 01:08:30.801
You don't know that.

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:32.151
We need to stop her.

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:34.457
MJ?
It's Claire.

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:37.548
No, don't hang up.
Listen, we need you.

01:08:52.606 --> 01:08:54.782
Do you understand?

01:08:54.826 --> 01:08:56.393
I will kill you.

01:08:56.435 --> 01:08:58.786
I only wanted to know
if your stay

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:00.179
would be ending soon.

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:02.529
And that's none
of your business.

01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:04.095
You two should be honored

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.011
that I chose
your house to stay in.

01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:08.666
We are.
We are very honored.

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:10.841
I told you not to
provoke her.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:24.595
I'm surprised
to see you out.

01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:28.251
I'll make this quick,
my jaw's wired shut.

01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:32.255
Um, I came over
as soon as I heard.

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:34.300
Thanks.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:36.475
They still don't know
what attacked me,

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.305
but they suspect--
Wait, what?

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:44.441
No, I meant about Claire
and Brooke,

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:46.094
they're missing.

01:09:46.138 --> 01:09:47.444
Since last night.

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:50.621
A witness heard them
fighting in the street.

01:09:50.663 --> 01:09:51.839
Police are involved.

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:54.145
Their families are worried sick.

How'd it go?
You were right.

01:10:14.993 --> 01:10:16.908
She told me
Brooke went rogue.

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.431
Told me to go home,
lock my door,

01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:20.564
and think positive thoughts.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.435
Did she offer you
anything to eat?

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:23.088
Yeah.

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:24.916

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:26.570

that we're all against her,

we still have power.

01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:49.436
Help me now,
to wipe her off the face.

01:19:57.836 --> 01:20:00.621
Help us now,
to wipe her off the face.

Victims of Jules,

01:20:03.494 --> 01:20:06.279
Help us now,
to wipe her off the face.

It's working.

01:20:09.152 --> 01:20:11.850
Help us now,
to wipe her off the face.

01:20:19.553 --> 01:20:20.816
Where are they going?

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.644
They're going after her,
I bet.

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.779
C'mon, let's...
Wha, we lost them?

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.259
Shh. Listen.

01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.478
This way.

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.569
Leave me to my
work now, Constable.

01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:37.136
There's nothing you can--

01:20:40.792 --> 01:20:42.054
You can't be here.

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.709
You're not real!

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.407
Nice try, Claire,

01:20:47.451 --> 01:20:49.061
but I've come up against
smarter people than you.

01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:51.281
I'm sure.
But all at once?

What the...?

01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:37.327
Whoa!

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:42.680
I'm gonna...

01:21:42.723 --> 01:21:45.074
need you to come down
to the station.

01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:46.945
Make a statement.

01:21:46.989 --> 01:21:48.904
Of course.

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:50.514
We'll be happy to.

01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:51.515
I mean,
maybe not now.

01:21:51.558 --> 01:21:53.212
But soon.

01:21:54.039 --> 01:21:55.693
Are you two all right?

01:21:55.736 --> 01:21:57.216
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.652
Are you?

01:21:58.696 --> 01:22:00.567
I'm fine.

01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:04.920
I'm gonna need
that tape, too.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:09.707
Oh, um, it's not
really tape any more.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.970
It's cards.

Okay,
I'm gonna need those cards.

Detention may
not seem fair,

01:22:22.024 --> 01:22:23.373
but if you repay
your wrongs now,

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:25.027
they won't catch up
with you later.

From Brunswick High,
I'm Claire.

01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:29.901
This is damn good
reporting.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.381
Thanks.

01:22:31.424 --> 01:22:34.079
But, it doesn't really
have an ending.

01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:36.299
I'm left with
all these questions.

01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:38.605

Hey there, news geeks.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.131
Claire,
you need a ride home?

01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:44.481
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:46.874
Hey, can you keep
shooting on this?

01:22:46.918 --> 01:22:48.137
Maybe add
something to it?

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.529
I mean,
we don't tell people

01:22:49.573 --> 01:22:51.053
if detention is good
or bad.

01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:53.098
That's not our job.

01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:54.447
I gotta run, Pete.

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:56.623
Yeah. Sure.

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:58.277
Again, nice work.

01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.800
Hella good reporting.

01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:05.284
Claire,
why are you still filming?

01:23:05.328 --> 01:23:07.286
It's over.
We won.

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:08.505

01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:10.072
Hi.

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:12.639
So I told Darren that I
needed a ladies' night...

01:23:12.683 --> 01:23:14.119
so what're we doing?

01:23:14.163 --> 01:23:16.556
Dinner at the diner?
Then a movie?

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.123
Yeah.
Hey, Claire?

01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:24.477
There's a lot about last night
that I don't really remember.

01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:26.305
That's probably
for the best.

01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.612
As long as I wasn't
caught on camera

01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:30.092

one of your friends

No, don't worry.

loss of anyone's virginity.

Beerginity.
Beerginity.

01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.493
Mine.
Forget it.

01:23:40.537 --> 01:23:42.365
All right, well, before
anything else weird happens,

01:23:42.408 --> 01:23:44.193
will you let me
take you out?

01:23:44.236 --> 01:23:45.455
