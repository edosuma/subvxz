02:27.000 --> 02:28.297
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

02:28.569 --> 02:33.199
I'm looking for a mechanic.
Anybody here fit that description?

02:33.407 --> 02:36.706
I might be able to help you.
What do you need?

02:36.910 --> 02:41.404
I need it fixed right away. I need
someone who knows what they're doing.

02:41.615 --> 02:44.243
I'm not that busy.
So, what's the problem?

02:44.518 --> 02:49.251
I'm not sure. Maybe you ought to
get under the hood and check it out.

02:50.290 --> 02:52.588
Yeah, maybe I better.

03:01.101 --> 03:03.092
Looks okay from here.

03:03.337 --> 03:05.965
Great customer service.

03:07.407 --> 03:10.467
Little bit of cleaning,
little bit of paint...

03:10.677 --> 03:13.339
...this place will be ready
for business.

03:13.547 --> 03:16.539
About time for me to play
in the Super Bowl.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.743
Those guys are gonna take you apart.

03:22.390 --> 03:25.621
Okay, we're gonna do it this time!
Ready?

03:27.896 --> 03:29.761
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah!

03:32.934 --> 03:34.561
Hike!

03:39.274 --> 03:41.674
To the left. You can do it. Cut back.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.505
Here it comes.

03:52.954 --> 03:54.387
All right!

03:57.458 --> 04:00.859
Okay, suckers walk. Suckers walk.

04:01.095 --> 04:05.361
Hey. Hey, suckers walk.
Go on. Suckers walk. Come on.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.659
Suckers walk!

04:10.805 --> 04:15.242
- Hey, Frankie, what's that mean?
- It means everything's okay.

04:15.743 --> 04:17.938
So how do you think I did?

04:18.213 --> 04:20.773
Pretty good with the sixth graders.

04:21.048 --> 04:24.815
You really know how to make a guy
feel great, you know that?

04:25.887 --> 04:29.414
What's the matter?
We don't look too happy today?

04:30.291 --> 04:32.316
I'm missing you already.

04:32.594 --> 04:35.085
Pretty soon you'll be so sick
of seeing me...

04:35.330 --> 04:38.629
...you'll pray to have some time
on your own. You know that?

04:38.833 --> 04:41.734
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, believe it.

04:45.006 --> 04:47.338
Now that's Italian.

04:50.845 --> 04:52.608
- I gotta go.
- No. No.

04:52.847 --> 04:55.407
- I gotta go. Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

04:55.650 --> 05:00.587
So I'm not so good against 10-year-olds?
I should try a different sport?

05:00.788 --> 05:01.948
Yeah, golf.

05:02.156 --> 05:03.852
- Golf?
- Yeah.

05:04.126 --> 05:07.755
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

05:09.031 --> 05:12.125
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

05:12.301 --> 05:17.364
You're lucky I have a sense of humour.
I would take that personal.

05:43.332 --> 05:44.959
Time to go to work.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.395
- All right, be good.
- Bye.

05:50.172 --> 05:51.867
Wait a minute.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.371
I got something for you.

05:54.977 --> 05:56.808
What's this?

05:57.012 --> 05:59.503
It's supposed to bring you luck.

06:02.217 --> 06:04.310
It's nice.

06:05.354 --> 06:07.413
Thanks.

06:09.191 --> 06:11.284
I could use it.

06:28.043 --> 06:30.603
- How'd it go, Frank? Good furlough?
- The best.

06:30.846 --> 06:33.906
- Did you see that game?
- I have to admit, I missed it.

06:34.116 --> 06:35.743
- It was awesome.
- Was it?

06:35.951 --> 06:39.409
- Yes. You missed a good one.
- I missed a good one?

06:39.621 --> 06:44.456
- I had more fun than you this weekend.
- I bet you did.

06:46.929 --> 06:48.921
Here you go, Roger.

06:49.199 --> 06:53.761
- How's the diesel running, Jimmy?
- Forget it. It stops, it stalls.

06:54.037 --> 06:57.097
- It don't go.
- You got water in the fuel line.

06:57.273 --> 06:59.400
Open your mouth.

06:59.609 --> 07:01.702
- You sure?
- I'd bet time on it.

07:01.945 --> 07:03.572
- Take it off.
- All right.

07:06.449 --> 07:08.747
I'll see you later, Jimmy.

07:09.352 --> 07:13.118
- I'll give you more starch next time.
- Yeah, do that.

07:13.390 --> 07:16.587
Say hi to the wife.
How you doing there, man?

07:16.793 --> 07:19.057
Frank! What'd you bring me?

07:19.229 --> 07:21.197
Here you go. Go kill yourself.

07:21.865 --> 07:24.857
- I thought you'd bring me a girl.
- I had one...

07:25.068 --> 07:28.003
...but the guards decided to keep her.

07:28.238 --> 07:31.901
I can't depend on you.
Let me ask you something else.

07:32.108 --> 07:34.474
- Did you go see the garage?
- It's beautiful.

07:35.512 --> 07:39.141
- No garage I ever stuck up was beautiful.
- This one is.

07:39.382 --> 07:43.785
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon. I don't come cheap.

07:44.020 --> 07:47.478
But you know I know my way
around cars. You need help, call me.

07:47.690 --> 07:51.922
- I fix them, I don't steal them.
- I was framed.

07:52.829 --> 07:54.296
What? I was framed.

08:22.625 --> 08:25.355
- What is this, Jimmy?
- I don't know, but it's official.

08:44.882 --> 08:47.009
Crack 210.

08:49.353 --> 08:52.880
- On your feet, Leone.
- What do you want?

08:53.090 --> 08:55.718
- Take him.
- What are you doing here?

08:55.960 --> 08:59.487
- You're being transferred.
- Transferred where?

09:03.234 --> 09:07.671
- That's not necessary.
- Step back! He's in our custody now.

09:07.905 --> 09:10.339
You got the wrong guy!

09:19.917 --> 09:21.475
Transferred where?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.427
Talk to me. Where am I going?

09:34.999 --> 09:38.628
- Get in there now!
- Where am I going?

09:42.439 --> 09:43.701
Hey!

09:43.874 --> 09:45.307
Where are we going?

09:45.609 --> 09:48.510
Hey! Talk to me!

10:33.325 --> 10:35.759
Let's go, Leone. Come on!

10:35.927 --> 10:38.828
- Get his ass out here!
- Come on, get out!

10:39.965 --> 10:43.423
- Where the hell are we? I wanna know!
- Shut up!

10:43.802 --> 10:47.203
You got the wrong man!
You made a mistake!

10:49.574 --> 10:51.804
There's no mistake.

10:56.014 --> 10:58.778
Welcome to Gateway, Leone.

10:58.984 --> 11:02.112
- Drumgoole?
- That's Warden Drumgoole, convict.

11:02.354 --> 11:04.618
- Captain.
- Move him!

11:04.823 --> 11:05.949
Move your ass!

11:06.658 --> 11:09.183
Let's go. Come on!

11:11.496 --> 11:15.728
You'll be issued one bar of soap,
two rolls of toilet paper per month.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.595
Somebody steals...
Turn your ass around!

11:18.837 --> 11:23.831
Somebody steals them, or you lose
them, wipe your ass with your shirt.

11:24.109 --> 11:28.102
You have one uniform.
Your number is 5-1-0. Remember it.

11:29.314 --> 11:34.047
This is C-wing. You will eat, shower
and take your yard time with your wing.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.187
There's 6 counts a day. Miss one,
you're in the hole. Miss two...

11:38.390 --> 11:41.518
...I will put you in the house of pain.

11:43.228 --> 11:44.855
Convict...

11:45.230 --> 11:48.825
...two things.
One: I am Meissner.

11:49.067 --> 11:52.264
Two: Never fuck with Meissner.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.664
Inside.

12:00.913 --> 12:04.872
- Sir, what about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

12:15.728 --> 12:18.663
You better watch your back, man!

12:53.699 --> 12:56.190
Come on, guys. Let's go.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.709
Nineteen-one.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.595
Nineteen-one! Crack it!

13:29.235 --> 13:32.432
Oh, yeah, you better not
eyeball me, boy.

13:32.638 --> 13:37.234
How were your accommodations last
night? Like your mama used to do you?

13:38.611 --> 13:41.205
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

14:05.972 --> 14:07.132
Hey!

14:07.374 --> 14:10.639
Open the door! You hear me?

14:11.645 --> 14:13.636
Hello, Frank.

14:14.648 --> 14:19.381
In the old days, the warden would've
come down that private passageway...

14:19.586 --> 14:24.614
...to this execution chamber to witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

14:25.192 --> 14:30.494
120 men and 4 women were electrocuted
in that chair before it was retired.

14:30.730 --> 14:35.667
Beautiful, isn't it? When I came here,
it was falling apart. I restored it...

14:35.869 --> 14:41.102
...put it back into working order to
remind me of how things ought to be.

14:41.374 --> 14:44.434
It's nearly five years since you
escaped from Treadmore.

14:44.678 --> 14:49.012
- Time flies when you're having fun.
- In all my years as warden there...

14:49.216 --> 14:53.619
...you're the only one who escaped.
- So I read in the papers.

14:53.854 --> 14:56.948
Yes, you did.
You and your lawyer saw to it...

14:57.123 --> 15:01.355
...that everything made it
into the papers. The media.

15:01.528 --> 15:05.521
Distorting the facts,
making a criminal into a hero...

15:05.699 --> 15:10.033
...and a warden into a criminal.
You took my future away from me.

15:10.203 --> 15:15.197
You and those politicians. They sent
you to Norwood. That's a country club.

15:15.375 --> 15:19.641
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

15:19.813 --> 15:22.782
You don't remember, do you?
I asked you.

15:22.949 --> 15:25.941
No, I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

15:26.119 --> 15:30.750
I had two weeks before I was released.
I asked for one hour to visit...

15:30.925 --> 15:34.861
...with that old man before he died.
- I was doing my job.

15:35.029 --> 15:37.554
There's a lot of ways to do your job!

15:37.732 --> 15:41.725
You could've given me an escorted leave,
could've had armed guards.

15:41.903 --> 15:46.101
You broke the law.
You broke the law, and I was punished!

15:46.507 --> 15:51.570
- I got five years. I paid my debt!
- Not to me. But you're going to.

15:51.979 --> 15:54.846
I've only got six months left
on my sentence.

15:55.016 --> 15:58.543
In Gateway,
six months could be a lifetime.

15:58.753 --> 16:02.883
This is hard time. You have no rights
here unless I give them to you.

16:03.057 --> 16:07.187
You feel no pleasure unless
I tell you you can. This is hell...

16:07.395 --> 16:11.024
...and I'm going to give you
the guided tour.

16:14.268 --> 16:19.001
Okay, tough guy. Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue around.

16:19.173 --> 16:21.505
You trying to kiss me, huh?

16:21.676 --> 16:24.008
Let me see your ears.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.545
What are you looking at, asshole?

16:35.723 --> 16:37.918
- You check his nose?
- Checked it.

16:38.092 --> 16:39.855
Good.

16:43.798 --> 16:46.824
This is a delousing chamber.
Don't breathe.

16:47.001 --> 16:52.132
X ylon-profic gas can be harmful to
your lungs. Stand with your legs apart...

16:52.306 --> 16:54.570
...arms out and away from your body.

16:54.942 --> 16:59.106
When I tell you, take a deep breath.
Hold it for 30 seconds.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.942
Start now.

17:21.002 --> 17:23.368
Ten seconds.

17:33.048 --> 17:37.280
Not yet. He can take more.

17:59.741 --> 18:01.436
Braden...

18:01.610 --> 18:07.310
...you'll learn that inmates are physically
more capable than you could imagine.

18:07.482 --> 18:10.713
If you underestimate them...

18:10.886 --> 18:13.753
...it will cost you dearly.

19:00.036 --> 19:01.970
Watch out for the birds.

19:02.138 --> 19:05.266
- What the hell you doing?
- Sorry.

19:12.281 --> 19:15.341
Yo, Billy, get that weight.

19:33.603 --> 19:37.801
Move it, ace. That's my spot.

19:53.055 --> 19:56.991
That's my spot too.

19:58.494 --> 20:01.930
- Any spot that isn't yours?
- Nope, they're all mine.

20:02.131 --> 20:05.430
You wanna use it, you gotta pay.

20:08.938 --> 20:11.839
Not so fast, ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you.

20:12.008 --> 20:17.207
That little thing around your neck,
that'll buy you a spot for the day.

20:18.781 --> 20:23.150
- Put a fucking hole in your heart.
- All right, break it up! Break it up!

20:23.319 --> 20:25.787
I said, break it up! Back off!

20:25.955 --> 20:29.288
Spread 'em. Back off!

20:29.458 --> 20:34.157
- All right, Weber, drop the shank.
- There ain't no shank, Braden.

20:35.631 --> 20:37.963
- All right, let's go.
- You motherfucker!

20:38.367 --> 20:42.532
- Spread 'em, goddamn it.
- You're making a big mistake, asshole.

20:44.575 --> 20:49.274
- You go in the hole for carrying that.
- Where's your witness, your evidence?

20:49.446 --> 20:51.346
Well, where is it?

20:51.515 --> 20:53.005
- He saw it.
- He didn't.

20:53.183 --> 20:57.711
- You saw him carrying the shank, right?
- I didn't see nothing.

20:57.888 --> 21:03.190
- You're making a bad mistake, Braden.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

21:08.999 --> 21:13.766
He would have put that shank in you.
What did you cover for him for?

21:13.937 --> 21:16.997
You got your rules, we got ours.

21:32.456 --> 21:37.450
Hey, hey, hey. I do know the face,
and I do know the name.

21:37.628 --> 21:41.155
Hey, Frank. Frank Leone, right?
Name's Dallas.

21:41.331 --> 21:44.596
I was in Treadmore
right before you busted out.

21:44.768 --> 21:48.670
- You were on A-block, weren't you?
- Yeah, I was on A-block.

21:48.839 --> 21:51.808
- Good memory.
- Treadmore doesn't have an A-block.

21:51.975 --> 21:57.003
- Watch your feet.
- Okay, dig it.

21:57.180 --> 22:00.638
Look, look,
I was there on transfer, man.

22:00.817 --> 22:03.479
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

22:03.654 --> 22:09.354
- You're looking at a devoted fan.
- D.T.A.

22:10.260 --> 22:14.822
D.T.A., okay. What's that, man?

22:14.998 --> 22:19.628
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Watch your feet.

22:20.203 --> 22:23.468
- D.T.A.
- D.T.A.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.008
You gotta trust somebody.
Let me hip you to the joint.

22:27.178 --> 22:31.615
See this fat tub of shit?
That's Manly. His partner's Wiley.

22:31.783 --> 22:36.049
They're sadistic pigs.
They ain't happy unless they hurt you.

22:36.220 --> 22:40.850
I mean, if the warden wants to put
the boot to you, he uses them.

22:41.025 --> 22:45.359
The black dude in the booth
is Captain Meissner.

22:45.663 --> 22:49.030
Now he runs the guards, okay?
He's one bad dude.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.327
We already met. I gotta do my work.

22:51.502 --> 22:56.030
Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool, man.

22:56.941 --> 22:59.171
So listen, Frank...

22:59.344 --> 23:03.405
...when you decide to make your break,
and I know you will...

23:03.581 --> 23:06.948
...you come talk to me.
You come talk to Dallas.

23:07.118 --> 23:10.554
Okay? Anything you want,
anything you need, man...

23:10.722 --> 23:14.317
...I can get it. Anything.
All right? Okay?

23:14.492 --> 23:14.559
No way. No damn way!

23:14.559 --> 23:17.187
No way. No damn way!

23:17.362 --> 23:21.423
You're always crying about how you
need a man who knows engines.

23:21.599 --> 23:23.226
I brought you the man, Homes.

23:23.401 --> 23:27.633
Look, don't "Homes" me.
The only thing you brought is trouble.

23:27.839 --> 23:31.275
- Come on, Eclipse.
- I heard all about you, Leone.

23:31.442 --> 23:35.469
Whatever is between you and
Drumgoole ain't coming in here.

23:35.646 --> 23:41.209
The boys ain't got no problem with me.
I ain't got no problem with the boys.

23:44.622 --> 23:47.750
Come on, Eclipse.
You're making me look bad.

23:47.925 --> 23:53.761
- I promised the dude a job. You owe me.
- I don't owe you or nobody nothing.

23:53.931 --> 23:58.766
Hey, you! Get your face out of that
motor! Get your face out of there.

23:58.936 --> 24:03.168
You don't know nothing about motors.
Stay away from it! Okay?

24:03.374 --> 24:06.309
It's been a while since I've seen
an old 265 small block.

24:06.477 --> 24:10.107
That's the last time
you're gonna see one in this shop.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.810
Come on. Frank, we can work this out.
We're all gentlemen here.

24:14.987 --> 24:19.720
It's his place. He knows what he
wants. It's okay. Thanks anyway.

24:23.095 --> 24:27.498
Thanks. You made me look beautiful.
I appreciate the endorsement.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.634
Hey, Frank. Hold up, man.

24:30.436 --> 24:34.634
You didn't want this job anyway, man.
Greasy fingers, oil on your clothes...

24:34.807 --> 24:40.177
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.837
- All right?
- Prison joke.

24:44.016 --> 24:47.417
I lost my watch. Why don't you give me
a hand looking for it.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.952
Roll your ass on out of here, man.

24:50.122 --> 24:54.786
Officer Vazquez, you ought to
put on a few pounds. You look frail.

24:54.960 --> 25:00.796
Frank, I meant what I said. I'm gonna
get you something good, easy, cool.

25:01.200 --> 25:06.194
- You're gonna love it.
- Shut up. Get inside. Shut up. Inside!

25:11.443 --> 25:14.503
Here's your shit from Norwood, Leone.

25:18.484 --> 25:21.681
All right. Lock in!

25:33.765 --> 25:35.960
Problem?

25:37.569 --> 25:40.231
No, I got no problems.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.269
I wanna know what's going on.

25:47.479 --> 25:51.347
All I know is that he's in
the general population...

25:51.517 --> 25:56.182
I don't give a damn about the general
population! I wanna know about Frank.

25:56.356 --> 25:59.416
- I'm not leaving...
- Calm down. He's all right.

25:59.592 --> 26:03.722
He was a model prisoner at Norwood.
Why bring him here?

26:03.897 --> 26:06.764
Routine transfer.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.304
- Hey, Frank?
- What?

26:17.510 --> 26:19.102
Hey, man.

26:20.580 --> 26:24.311
- It's hot in here, man.
- I know. But at least it's easy.

26:24.517 --> 26:28.078
I know, man.
I'm sorry, I didn't do too good.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.384
Walk with me. I gotta show you
something. It's important.

26:32.559 --> 26:35.027
- No. Here, you try.
- No. Come on, man.

26:35.195 --> 26:37.925
- You'll like it.
- I'm not into hard labour.

26:38.097 --> 26:43.160
- It's cool. It's easy.
- Okay. There. I'm burnt out. Come on.

26:43.336 --> 26:45.827
Come on, you're gonna love this.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.466
Watch the steam, Frank.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.572
I got these off this old trustee.
He did the plumbing here.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.914
Everybody thought he was a nut.
Doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

27:02.589 --> 27:05.353
- Come on, hurry up.
- All right, cool.

27:06.059 --> 27:10.928
The tunnels under every cellblock,
they lead to the steam plant, okay?

27:11.097 --> 27:14.328
I go out across the steam lines.
Dig this.

27:14.500 --> 27:19.494
I shimmy, okay? Across the
steam pipes to the sally port, okay?

27:19.672 --> 27:24.006
Over there, there's trucks coming
and going. I wait for my time...

27:24.310 --> 27:29.270
...l'm on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas, man. Huh?

27:30.483 --> 27:34.943
You're the doctor. Operate.
I want your professional opinion.

27:35.121 --> 27:39.889
Let's run it backwards. I see these
trucks. They stop running at 9:00.

27:40.094 --> 27:44.997
At 9:00, the tower guards are at full
staff and all the inmates are awake.

27:45.165 --> 27:50.102
Before you go 10 feet, every con in the
joint knows you're gone. And this thing...

27:50.271 --> 27:52.865
...this shimmy?
- Shimmy slide.

27:53.040 --> 27:57.136
You're gonna shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe...

27:57.311 --> 27:59.472
...running at 160 degrees
and get away with it?

27:59.647 --> 28:04.812
You try, they'll change your name from
Departing Dallas to Deep-Fried Dallas.

28:09.256 --> 28:12.020
- Just a thought, man.
- The thought that counts.

28:12.192 --> 28:16.390
- I got a plane to catch. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Dallas?

28:16.897 --> 28:19.161
You got a cigarette?

28:20.768 --> 28:24.135
It's my last one. Here.
Go ahead. Finish that.

28:24.305 --> 28:27.763
It ain't much,
but it's the thought that counts, right?

28:47.795 --> 28:52.664
Last call. Mess hall, last call.
Mess, coming up.

28:55.436 --> 29:00.305
Looks like some delicious garbage
stew. Just like Mom used to make.

29:00.474 --> 29:02.942
That's why I shot her.

29:03.811 --> 29:07.713
- Can I have some gravy, please?
- You want some gravy?

29:07.881 --> 29:11.044
- Here's your gravy.
- You got it all over my food.

29:11.218 --> 29:12.981
- Move!
- What's your problem?

29:13.187 --> 29:16.247
- Nothing. Move it!
- What's that kid's story?

29:16.423 --> 29:18.050
In for murder.

29:18.225 --> 29:21.992
Claims he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

29:22.197 --> 29:27.066
Waiting while his buddy bought beer.
Didn't know the guy was packing heat.

29:27.235 --> 29:31.467
Two guys dead. Kid's doing
the Big Bitch now: Double life.

29:31.639 --> 29:35.200
He'll make parole when he's about 400.

29:35.377 --> 29:40.246
Move it!
What are you, a slow study or what?

29:40.415 --> 29:41.439
Screw that guy.

29:43.017 --> 29:46.509
So I didn't get a chance
to make the reservation...

29:46.721 --> 29:49.815
...so why don't we get a seat
over there.

29:51.126 --> 29:53.253
- What are you doing?
- Taking this.

29:53.428 --> 29:58.331
- Why don't you go take something else?
- I'll throw you through this table.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.968
- Want some cake?
- Are you chumping off on me?

30:01.136 --> 30:02.831
- Not hungry. Want this?
- Who are you?

30:03.004 --> 30:04.437
Nobody. Here.

30:06.374 --> 30:11.812
- I'm on a diet. This spot taken?
- Why don't you stand up to that dirtbag?

30:11.980 --> 30:14.881
Shut up.
He just saved you a lot of healing.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.515
What's your name?

30:17.685 --> 30:21.280
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

30:21.456 --> 30:23.481
Helps when you get mail.

30:24.025 --> 30:27.517
Oh, yeah. I need a name?
They call me Killer.

30:27.695 --> 30:32.530
That's original. Did you think that up,
or did someone give you a hand with it?

30:32.700 --> 30:35.863
- I call myself what I want, okay?
- Okay.

30:36.037 --> 30:40.269
Killer, this is Dallas. I'm Frank.
Dallas, what do you think this is here?

30:40.442 --> 30:43.377
- Wanna give me an idea?
- These might be peas.

30:43.545 --> 30:46.480
They might not.
They might be toxic waste.

30:46.748 --> 30:48.716
Who cares? It's all crap.

30:49.017 --> 30:54.819
- Eat vegetables to grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables. Nobody asked.

30:54.989 --> 30:58.823
We got 325 other killers in here.
Most, unlike you, live up to it.

30:58.993 --> 31:03.327
Put your leg in the aisle.
Be ready to move.

31:03.498 --> 31:07.196
Hey, nobody tells me
to do nothing, all right?

31:32.061 --> 31:38.000
You always gotta be ready to move first.
You just might make it to first base.

31:39.435 --> 31:43.599
First base.
There's a name for him, huh?

31:52.481 --> 31:54.881
- It's good to be outside.
- It's cold.

31:55.050 --> 31:57.985
It's not that bad.
It's good to keep moving.

31:58.153 --> 32:03.284
How come you got this up attitude?
How can you be up in this joint?

32:03.459 --> 32:07.919
It's a mindset. Your body has to
be in here, but your brain doesn't.

32:08.097 --> 32:11.362
As long as you keep moving,
you don't become a piece of this place.

32:11.534 --> 32:13.627
- What's that, like, guru stuff?
- Yeah.

32:13.802 --> 32:17.397
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- You getting sarcastic?

32:18.274 --> 32:20.902
Fucking birds.

32:22.945 --> 32:26.244
Fucking birds don't eat in the rain.

32:26.415 --> 32:32.183
- Yeah, well, they'll come back.
- You save your bread for me tomorrow?

32:32.388 --> 32:35.186
Yeah, sure.
Put that on your list, okay?

32:35.391 --> 32:37.484
Thanks.

32:37.660 --> 32:41.152
Why you talking crazy, man?
It's a waste of time.

32:41.330 --> 32:44.197
To you, it's a waste.
To him, it's all he's got.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.699
That's more than you got.
In here, you gotta respect that.

32:47.903 --> 32:52.705
You don't get much, and what you got,
you gotta protect. You know that?

32:52.909 --> 32:56.436
You don't know nothing yet.
Come on, let's run.

33:02.786 --> 33:04.845
- Come on, Frank.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

33:05.021 --> 33:08.980
I'm gonna get wet.
Send you my laundry bills.

33:18.501 --> 33:21.436
Feel something, Leone?

33:23.239 --> 33:26.003
Wanna play? They're a man short.

33:33.984 --> 33:36.851
Hey! I'm talking to you!

33:38.221 --> 33:43.557
Hey, punk! When you gonna paint your
nails and answer to the name "bitch"?

33:44.361 --> 33:50.766
- You got a big mouth. Keep it shut.
- You fucker, I'll tear your ass off!

33:51.201 --> 33:55.865
You wanna play? We'll play.
You talk too much. Let's play.

33:56.039 --> 34:00.976
Goddamn right we'll play. You
and I'll play later, you little fuck.

34:14.224 --> 34:20.219
You want more, Leone? We got more
for you. Come on. Come on.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.891
- Stay down!
- That's a cheap shot!

34:30.806 --> 34:35.302
- What kind of game is this?
- This ain't no game. This is a lesson.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.458
- Got something to say?
- Yeah.

34:56.634 --> 34:58.602
- Say it! Say it!
- First down!

34:58.769 --> 35:03.263
Fuck you. That's your last one!
You're dead, Leone!

35:03.441 --> 35:06.740
You'll never last the fucking game!

35:21.859 --> 35:24.987
Get in there, hit him.
Come on, get in there.

35:25.930 --> 35:27.693
Set!

35:27.865 --> 35:32.359
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

35:54.492 --> 35:56.983
I'll beat you up, man.

36:08.839 --> 36:10.966
Frank!

36:24.156 --> 36:26.556
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

36:38.136 --> 36:43.836
Fuck up! Get over on that other team.
That's who you're playing for anyway.

36:49.080 --> 36:52.447
- What took you so long?
- You need the help...

36:52.651 --> 36:55.950
...and I need the exercise.
So call the play.

36:59.191 --> 37:01.284
You're dead, Leone!

37:14.606 --> 37:19.373
- Shit, what hit me?
- F-train, son. F-train.

37:31.223 --> 37:34.215
Don't lay down on me now. Come on.

37:38.196 --> 37:40.790
Come on, Leone.
Come on, you son of a bitch!

37:40.966 --> 37:43.730
All right,
I'm going over tackle on two.

37:43.902 --> 37:45.130
All right, Frank!

37:45.637 --> 37:46.797
Ready.

37:50.342 --> 37:51.639
Set.

37:51.943 --> 37:53.001
You're dead!

37:53.411 --> 37:55.003
Hut-one.

37:56.615 --> 37:57.809
Hut-two.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.213
Go, baby!

38:08.361 --> 38:09.419
Come on, Frank!

38:24.477 --> 38:26.502
We did it!

38:52.204 --> 38:54.832
Hey, come on Wiley. Come on, man!

38:56.909 --> 39:01.346
Next time I want, you give.

39:10.790 --> 39:16.160
Move it. Out. The game is over.
Let's go. You don't listen, do you?

39:17.063 --> 39:21.159
- You okay? Come on. Come on.
- Put him down!

39:21.334 --> 39:26.795
You ain't no doctor. He's on his own.
Get inside.

39:31.544 --> 39:34.206
Real badass, huh?

39:35.614 --> 39:37.707
See you inside, Leone.

39:38.718 --> 39:45.021
Count time, 10 minutes. All inmates
will return to their wings for count.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.232
Let's go, men!

40:38.578 --> 40:40.808
You won't break me.

41:07.474 --> 41:10.136
Still interested in the job?

41:13.146 --> 41:14.340
Yeah, I am.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.527
You sure know your way around
an engine. Who taught you?

41:37.171 --> 41:40.504
This old man named Galleti.

41:40.675 --> 41:43.166
Took me off the street
when I was 14.

41:43.344 --> 41:46.939
Taught me that I could do something
besides hanging out on corners.

41:47.115 --> 41:51.313
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

41:51.486 --> 41:54.717
- Is that who you broke out for?
- Yeah. I owed him.

41:54.889 --> 41:58.825
Tell me, what put you in the joint
in the first place?

41:58.993 --> 42:03.020
One night these punks broke into the
garage and put a beating on Galleti.

42:03.197 --> 42:06.223
The whole neighbourhood knew about it.
The cops knew.

42:06.400 --> 42:11.235
But these punks were connected,
so the cops didn't do anything. I did.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.669
So after all the smoke had cleared...

42:13.841 --> 42:19.245
...these guys were in the hospital, and I
was doing time for aggravated assault.

42:19.714 --> 42:23.616
- Care to join me in a little contraband?
- Why not?

42:25.553 --> 42:28.215
I can see why they call you Eclipse.

42:28.422 --> 42:31.983
- I do block a lot of sun, don't I?
- That you do.

42:32.160 --> 42:37.393
I had a guy on the outside that used
to get me good Havanas. Not this crap.

42:37.565 --> 42:40.193
But someday... Someday.

42:40.368 --> 42:42.734
Yeah, someday.

42:43.437 --> 42:46.929
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

42:50.011 --> 42:53.105
Eclipse, what do you
got hiding back there?

42:54.115 --> 42:55.446
That's my baby.

42:58.786 --> 43:02.916
- Good bodywork.
- Call this here vehicle Maybelline.

43:03.090 --> 43:05.524
- Hello, Maybelline.
- This is my baby.

43:05.693 --> 43:07.217
Nice.

43:09.764 --> 43:12.927
There it is. '65 Ford Mustang V8.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.899
Two eighty-nine, with 225 horsepower.

43:16.071 --> 43:19.734
- When did you last turn her over?
- She's been dead for 15 years.

43:19.908 --> 43:25.141
Couple guys tried to get her going
and couldn't. I'm a body man myself.

43:25.314 --> 43:28.306
- Mind if I give it a try?
- It's a dead issue.

43:30.786 --> 43:33.949
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

43:38.293 --> 43:40.921
Save the headstone, man.

43:41.129 --> 43:43.962
Easy, easy...

46:16.018 --> 46:20.580
Eclipse. Nothing's dead till
it's buried. Did I tell you that?

46:24.627 --> 46:26.822
I love it!

46:28.398 --> 46:28.498
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

46:28.498 --> 46:31.990
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

46:32.735 --> 46:35.329
- The poem.
- It's a jailhouse poem.

46:35.505 --> 46:37.996
- Something we all wrote.
- Excuse me.

46:40.176 --> 46:44.170
When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think

46:44.348 --> 46:48.341
When we're in a drunken mood
We gamble, play and drink

46:48.519 --> 46:52.649
But when our moods are over
When our time has come to pass

46:52.823 --> 46:57.760
We hope they bury us upside down
So the warden can kiss our ass

46:57.928 --> 46:59.862
- Amen!
- I like that.

47:00.030 --> 47:02.897
- You like that, huh?
- It's a little catchy.

47:05.002 --> 47:08.494
This is the best.
I mean, this is good, man.

47:08.672 --> 47:11.470
- What's wrong, man?
- Nothing.

47:12.776 --> 47:17.679
I wouldn't smoke around this, but
it tastes as good as any dollar wine.

47:17.848 --> 47:19.873
Check, please.

47:20.984 --> 47:23.714
Wait.
When my moods are over

47:23.887 --> 47:26.549
And my...
That's not it. Wait a minute.

47:28.192 --> 47:31.423
You married,
or thinking about it, or what?

47:31.595 --> 47:34.996
Are you proposing to me?
You're not my type.

47:35.165 --> 47:37.395
- No, I'm not married.
- Not married?

47:37.568 --> 47:43.666
- Plan to get married when you get out?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

47:43.841 --> 47:48.244
- You know, I had this really nice girl.
- Yeah?

47:48.412 --> 47:51.074
She was nice. And we were in love.

47:51.548 --> 47:54.847
And we started talking
about getting married.

47:55.018 --> 47:59.182
She's got three brothers, like,
about 1 percent retarded, these guys.

47:59.356 --> 48:01.381
They throw a beating on me.

48:01.825 --> 48:04.555
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

48:04.728 --> 48:07.060
Don't take it personal.

48:07.231 --> 48:11.861
She wrote me for a while.
Then it just stopped.

48:12.035 --> 48:17.063
That's when it hit me: I ain't
ever gonna be with a girl again.

48:17.241 --> 48:21.735
I'm gonna end up like Eclipse,
kissing pictures in magazines.

48:21.912 --> 48:24.881
There's so many things I ain't done.

48:25.048 --> 48:28.746
- I ain't never learned how to drive.
- What?

48:28.920 --> 48:31.980
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car.

48:34.926 --> 48:39.420
I hope we don't get a speeding ticket.
I'd hate to end up in jail.

48:39.597 --> 48:44.864
Don't be a wise guy. You wanna learn
to drive? This is the best I can do.

48:45.036 --> 48:49.234
Okay. Now cut it sharp.
That's it. All right.

48:49.407 --> 48:54.435
Hang a left on 42nd Street. We'll go
to Broadway and check out the action.

48:54.612 --> 48:57.274
Broadway?
We're doing circles in a garage.

48:57.448 --> 49:00.440
Come on, First,
work here with me, okay?

49:00.618 --> 49:03.610
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

49:03.788 --> 49:06.484
I wanna check out the action,
of course.

49:07.292 --> 49:10.125
- Turn left on 42nd Street.
- I got it.

49:10.895 --> 49:14.456
Look, the place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

49:14.632 --> 49:19.035
Check out those ladies!
Wanna come for a ride in my new car?

49:19.203 --> 49:21.603
- Hey, baby!
- They ain't responding.

49:21.773 --> 49:25.470
They're not your type.
When were you last in Atlantic City?

49:25.643 --> 49:29.135
- I ain't never been there.
- You are now. What do you think?

49:29.314 --> 49:34.149
- I don't know. What does it resemble?
- It's the best. Look at the lights.

49:34.319 --> 49:37.482
The Boardwalk
is jumping day and night.

49:37.722 --> 49:41.556
It's hot music. You got high rollers.
You got parties.

49:41.726 --> 49:46.425
You got money. You got gambling.
You got 10,000 chorus girls!

49:46.598 --> 49:50.864
Hey, baby, wanna come for a ride
in my new vehicle?

49:51.035 --> 49:53.003
Man. Yo, that was great, man.

49:53.171 --> 49:57.369
I hate to tell you, your engine just blew
a rod. You're ready for Indianapolis.

49:57.542 --> 49:59.134
You got the touch.

49:59.310 --> 50:01.801
Frank, let me ask you one favour, man.

50:01.980 --> 50:04.574
I appreciate the drive
and everything...

50:04.749 --> 50:08.685
...but none of this is real unless I
hear this engine kick over just once.

50:08.853 --> 50:13.154
If I turn the engine on, the guards
will bust in here and grab us...

50:13.359 --> 50:16.328
...and throw us in the hole forever.
Forget it.

50:16.495 --> 50:20.363
Come on, Frank. Just for 10 seconds.
It'll last for the rest of my life.

50:20.532 --> 50:23.399
You're such a pain in the ass.

50:23.569 --> 50:29.974
Come on, Frank. Let me just
hear that engine. We built it, man.

50:32.277 --> 50:35.610
All right, go on. Ten seconds.

50:37.683 --> 50:41.175
Yeah! All right, looking good!

50:41.620 --> 50:44.783
- Ain't that great?
- It's beautiful, baby.

50:44.957 --> 50:46.720
Hit it, one time!

50:46.892 --> 50:48.792
All right, one more time.

50:48.994 --> 50:51.087
Damn it, Frank.

50:51.263 --> 50:55.529
Okay, turn it off.
You got it, you did it. Turn it off.

50:56.135 --> 50:58.501
Hey, kill it, Frank. Come on, man.

50:58.671 --> 51:01.231
Come on, First. Turn it off.

51:01.407 --> 51:05.503
If I turn it off I ain't never
gonna turn it on again, right?

51:05.678 --> 51:07.703
That's right.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.940
Please, turn it off, First.

51:11.116 --> 51:13.744
- First!
- Sorry, Frank.

51:13.919 --> 51:14.943
Oh, shit!

51:15.120 --> 51:17.645
Frank, turn it off
and get him out of that car.

51:17.823 --> 51:19.450
Get him out!

51:19.625 --> 51:21.456
Frank, get on that kid.

51:21.627 --> 51:23.788
Stop that kid!

51:27.966 --> 51:29.524
Look out!

51:44.183 --> 51:46.174
First! First!

51:46.351 --> 51:49.582
First, turn it off, you crazy bastard!

51:54.126 --> 51:56.287
All right, stop that car now.

51:56.463 --> 52:00.058
I repeat, stop that car now!

52:04.337 --> 52:06.669
They're gonna kill you!

52:11.578 --> 52:14.638
- This is Meissner. Stop firing.
- The warden said...

52:14.814 --> 52:18.306
- Goddamn it, I said stop firing!
- Hold it, hold it.

52:21.087 --> 52:24.523
First, turn it off! Hold it. Hold it.

52:26.526 --> 52:30.360
Look out! Look out, Frank.
Look out, man!

52:30.530 --> 52:34.022
Get out of the car!
They're gonna kill your ass.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.498
- Did you see that ride?
- Are you crazy?

52:36.669 --> 52:40.161
- It's beautiful. I can drive.
- It's beautiful...

52:40.340 --> 52:44.242
All right. You're one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

52:46.679 --> 52:47.703
Move!

52:50.483 --> 52:55.819
- You bought yourself a trip to the hole.
- Leave Frank alone!

52:57.757 --> 53:01.249
Let's go, let's go. Break it up!
Break it up! Let's go.

53:01.427 --> 53:05.329
Let him go. You have the wrong man.

53:05.765 --> 53:07.699
- Take Leone to the hole.
- Back off.

53:07.867 --> 53:10.427
- Six weeks.
- It was my fault, sir!

53:10.603 --> 53:11.729
Save it.

53:11.905 --> 53:14.135
Get off me.

53:15.441 --> 53:17.375
Captain?

53:17.544 --> 53:22.709
I want five inmates. Give me a bat.
I wanna break up this car.

53:22.882 --> 53:25.749
Hold it right there, now!

53:26.719 --> 53:29.882
I want you to watch this, Leone.

54:38.993 --> 54:41.791
Back to the honeymoon suite!

54:47.434 --> 54:49.265
Night.

54:52.439 --> 54:56.034
- You should've been notified...
- Why is he in isolation?

54:56.243 --> 54:58.837
- I don't have that information.
- You don't have it?

54:59.013 --> 55:01.675
Then I wanna see
the goddamn warden!

55:01.849 --> 55:03.282
Not today.

55:04.385 --> 55:07.821
Every hour when the light comes on,
you'll stand, face the camera...

55:07.988 --> 55:10.320
...and state your name and number.

55:10.491 --> 55:12.516
Name and number!

55:12.693 --> 55:14.320
Leone, five-ten.

55:14.495 --> 55:16.463
Face the camera.

55:16.630 --> 55:18.996
Name and number.

55:20.167 --> 55:22.795
Leone, five-ten.

55:33.715 --> 55:36.013
Name and number.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.319
Leone, five-ten.

55:40.488 --> 55:41.921
Leone, five-ten.

55:42.090 --> 55:44.718
Leone. Leone. Leone.

55:47.095 --> 55:48.562
Name and number.

55:53.501 --> 55:57.437
Leone, five-ten.

56:03.545 --> 56:05.843
On your feet. Name and number.

56:07.949 --> 56:11.316
Give Mr. Leone half rations
the rest of his time.

56:11.486 --> 56:12.510
Yes, sir.

56:13.421 --> 56:14.513
Name and number!

56:23.865 --> 56:25.594
Get up!

56:25.767 --> 56:27.598
He seems a little sluggish.

56:28.703 --> 56:29.727
Wake him up.

56:38.613 --> 56:40.376
Cold enough?

56:52.060 --> 56:55.860
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

56:56.798 --> 56:59.995
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

57:00.168 --> 57:02.227
You got a little cruel streak.

57:05.106 --> 57:07.074
Leone, five-ten.

57:09.245 --> 57:12.976
- Upright. Name and number.
- Leone, five-ten.

57:19.822 --> 57:23.485
You'll be praying for some time
on your own. You know that?

57:23.659 --> 57:27.789
- I don't believe that.
- Trust me. I know about these things.

57:29.098 --> 57:31.430
Leone, five-ten.

57:31.600 --> 57:33.591
Water.

57:41.343 --> 57:44.005
Leone, five-ten.

57:45.815 --> 57:47.214
Name and number.

57:47.416 --> 57:49.646
Name and number!
Name and number!

57:49.819 --> 57:52.185
Marilyn Monroe.

57:52.354 --> 57:58.224
Thirty-seven, something, thirty-five.

58:07.803 --> 58:10.135
Crack 121.

58:14.310 --> 58:18.940
Listen, I didn't mean it.
No, I didn't say anything at all. No!

58:31.694 --> 58:34.162
That's enough.

58:49.078 --> 58:51.603
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

58:52.114 --> 58:56.575
Does the warden hate him enough
to kill him? 'Cause that ain't my job.

58:56.753 --> 59:01.087
Mr. Sensitive. He thinks
we're treating Leone too rough.

59:01.258 --> 59:04.386
Forget which are the cops
and which are the cons?

59:04.561 --> 59:06.552
- You want me? Come on!
- Break it up!

59:06.730 --> 59:09.858
Damn it, I said break it up!
Break it up!

59:15.305 --> 59:18.240
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

59:23.280 --> 59:24.508
Pussy.

59:24.681 --> 59:28.515
Get out of my sight, before I shine
my boots with your face...

59:28.685 --> 59:32.314
...you fat piece of shit! Go on!

59:43.633 --> 59:45.760
Time's up.

01:00:05.922 --> 01:00:08.982
Remember what I told you, Frank.

01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:14.461
Roll with the system. Roll with it
or it's only gonna get harder.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:21.865
Yeah, and it's getting shorter too.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:41.949
So, what's new, Mr. Braden?

01:00:43.661 --> 01:00:48.030
How's the family? Good?

01:00:48.199 --> 01:00:50.963
How are the Jets doing?

01:00:51.135 --> 01:00:54.195
Don't forget to check your bed.

01:01:50.428 --> 01:01:52.089
Hey, Frank.

01:01:53.264 --> 01:01:55.459
Somebody die in here?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.858
Ain't a very good welcome home, is it?

01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:12.680
Hey, big man.

01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:18.049
Sand. The whole engine block
is full of it. It was Chink.

01:02:18.222 --> 01:02:21.123
What are we gonna do about it?

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:23.557
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

01:02:23.729 --> 01:02:28.063
We poured everything we got into this
car. No way we can let Chink slide.

01:02:28.233 --> 01:02:31.259
- Let it go, First Base.
- Let it go?!

01:02:31.436 --> 01:02:34.462
Aren't you the guy who says
you gotta protect what's yours...

01:02:34.639 --> 01:02:38.439
...watch each other's back,
you watch mine, I watch yours?

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:42.944
I guess that was a bunch of jive,
now that you're a short-timer.

01:02:43.115 --> 01:02:46.414
You're incredible. What?

01:02:46.585 --> 01:02:49.782
You think this is your car?
This ain't your car.

01:02:49.955 --> 01:02:54.824
This is the warden's car. Did you
think that Chink Weber did this?

01:02:54.993 --> 01:02:58.258
Drumgoole did this.
Come on.

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:02.230
Did you think we were gonna
take our dates out in this car?

01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:04.528
Maybe rotate it on weekends.

01:03:04.736 --> 01:03:08.763
Ernie, why don't you take it Friday.
Dallas, take it Saturday.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.172
And Eclipse, you got it Sunday!
Is that what you thought?

01:03:13.345 --> 01:03:17.748
It's his! This lift is his, these
tools are his, the garage is his!

01:03:17.916 --> 01:03:21.147
This whole goddamn place is his.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.149
And you better remember that,
because once you buy into this...

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:30.751
..."our car," "our thing" concept,
man, you're his too!

01:03:38.637 --> 01:03:40.537
Just let it go.

01:03:42.507 --> 01:03:46.568
- I thought you were our leader.
- Goddamn it, I'm not your leader!

01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:48.211
And this ain't a gang.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.872
We're convicts.
We're prisoners, we're inmates.

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:56.146
We're here. And as long as we're
here, we're gonna stay his.

01:03:56.321 --> 01:03:58.789
We're his.

01:03:58.957 --> 01:04:01.517
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

01:04:01.693 --> 01:04:04.423
You gotta face the facts.

01:04:04.596 --> 01:04:08.226
Now, you guys are standup,
no doubt about it.

01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:13.498
But I got three weeks to get out of
here. And in three weeks, I'm walking.

01:04:13.673 --> 01:04:18.007
Ain't nothing gonna change that.

01:04:18.177 --> 01:04:20.543
That's all I care about.

01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:34.687
It's nothing for nothing, man.
He's right.

01:04:46.239 --> 01:04:51.973
Leone, how do you like my belt buckle,
boy? Yeah, I know. I like it too.

01:04:52.144 --> 01:04:55.341
A little souvenir
that reminds me of you.

01:04:55.515 --> 01:04:59.849
Tell me, what are you
going to do about it?

01:05:02.655 --> 01:05:09.060
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

01:05:11.764 --> 01:05:15.791
It ain't over, you son of a bitch.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.379
- Anybody call this spot?
- You guys don't need reservations.

01:05:32.552 --> 01:05:37.251
- You on a diet, Frank? Huh, man?
- Cutting back a little bit.

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.591
- Take some of my food.
- Here you go. Don't worry about it.

01:05:41.761 --> 01:05:42.921
- Bread.
- Thanks.

01:05:43.095 --> 01:05:45.996
Some tomatoes.
You'll be all right. Celery stick.

01:05:46.165 --> 01:05:47.598
I ain't playing football.

01:05:47.767 --> 01:05:52.671
Don't worry about that guy. He's a
lifer. You only got a few weeks to go.

01:05:52.839 --> 01:05:54.363
Forget about him.

01:05:54.942 --> 01:05:58.002
A miracle just happened.
First Base finally learned something.

01:05:58.178 --> 01:06:00.146
I doubt it.

01:06:00.614 --> 01:06:03.276
- Okay, who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.509
She was terrific, wasn't she?

01:06:07.187 --> 01:06:10.987
- I thought I could rely on you, Weber.
- He won't be pushed.

01:06:11.158 --> 01:06:14.457
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

01:06:14.628 --> 01:06:17.620
Everyone has a weak spot, Weber.

01:06:17.798 --> 01:06:22.565
Find his, or I'll have
to find a new yard boss.

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:29.436
- Welcome to the Gateway Stakes.
- I feel like a steamed vegetable.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:32.374
- Let's start the race.
- All right. What's your bug's name?

01:06:32.546 --> 01:06:35.310
- Dirt Creature.
- Three-to-two on Dirt Creature.

01:06:35.482 --> 01:06:37.712
- First Base, what's your bug's name?
- Rear Entry.

01:06:37.884 --> 01:06:39.579
Rear Entry's 4-to-5.
Place your bets.

01:06:39.753 --> 01:06:44.349
Two'll get you three, five'll get
you four. Five'll get you four.

01:06:47.027 --> 01:06:49.257
Everything I got on Dirt Creature.

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:54.025
- I bet the house on Rear Entry.
- The window is closed. All bets are in.

01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:56.567
Gentlemen, start your insects.

01:06:56.737 --> 01:06:59.171
- On your marks, get set...
- Come on, Dirt.

01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:01.432
Boom! They're off.

01:07:04.044 --> 01:07:06.535
I've got a steak dinner
on this victory.

01:07:06.713 --> 01:07:08.840
Come on, Dirt. Come on.

01:07:11.518 --> 01:07:12.712
You can't do that.

01:07:12.886 --> 01:07:14.410
We got a steward's inquiry.

01:07:14.588 --> 01:07:16.249
You can't push your bug!

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:19.119
It was a come-from-behind
victory by Rear Entry!

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:21.590
- We're gonna rerun the race.
- Hey, no rematch.

01:07:21.762 --> 01:07:25.630
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Shit.

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:29.858
- Peña! You're on the wrong detail.
- Stand up.

01:07:30.037 --> 01:07:32.767
Get you ass up here!
Clean up the gym.

01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:35.909
- We got a rematch later, all right?
- Sure.

01:07:36.277 --> 01:07:38.905
I'm getting out of here.
I'll pay up later.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.377
Now, asshole!

01:07:40.948 --> 01:07:44.941
Give me a break. I gotta get
dressed. You know what I mean?

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:47.053
Hey, watch out for my bug.

01:07:47.221 --> 01:07:50.418
I'll take care of him
for you, really. Delicious.

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:54.720
- Come on, let's do it today!
- All right.

01:08:13.448 --> 01:08:15.780
- Clean this place up.
- It's already cleaned.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:19.442
- What are you, deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

01:10:05.594 --> 01:10:07.585
Come on. One by one, come on!

01:10:10.065 --> 01:10:11.896
Come on.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.465
Get him down there.

01:10:26.215 --> 01:10:28.046
Pull his head.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.321
I told you we'd play later,
you little bitch.

01:10:47.069 --> 01:10:49.299
Hey, Leone!

01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:52.565
- They got First.
- I can't hear you.

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:59.210
- What did you say?
- They got First Base in the gym.

01:10:59.948 --> 01:11:03.783
- What is it?
- They got First Base in the gym.

01:11:18.935 --> 01:11:21.028
First!

01:11:49.899 --> 01:11:52.026
Twenty years old.

01:11:52.335 --> 01:11:58.296
This kid's twenty years old.
I told you.

01:11:58.474 --> 01:12:01.966
I know. I know.

01:12:10.219 --> 01:12:13.313
You want me, you got me.

01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:16.781
You fucking Nazi.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.363
You want me, you got me.

01:12:53.697 --> 01:12:55.528
Get him. Get him!

01:12:55.699 --> 01:13:00.568
- I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
- Come on, fight. Fight!

01:13:34.438 --> 01:13:36.633
Kick his ass!

01:13:48.952 --> 01:13:50.817
I'll kill you.

01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:53.747
Son of a bitch.

01:13:54.658 --> 01:13:56.250
I'll kill you.

01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:36.964
Do it.

01:14:38.069 --> 01:14:39.400
Crush his face!

01:14:43.808 --> 01:14:45.207
- Do it!
- Take him out!

01:14:45.376 --> 01:14:46.968
Drop it! Drop it!

01:15:08.867 --> 01:15:10.198
God.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.115
Linen run!

01:15:31.289 --> 01:15:34.884
Get a move on.
I'm trying to make a living here.

01:15:36.628 --> 01:15:40.496
Frank, my man. Florence Nightingale.

01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:43.894
- How you feeling?
- All right.

01:15:44.068 --> 01:15:48.300
- Three weeks and you're out, man.
- Feels like three years.

01:15:48.506 --> 01:15:51.998
Come on, man.
Three weeks is a blink.

01:15:53.578 --> 01:15:56.138
What'd they do with the kid?

01:15:58.883 --> 01:16:02.819
They sent him home, man.
What'd you think? You know.

01:16:04.789 --> 01:16:08.589
You know, the kid told me once...

01:16:09.561 --> 01:16:15.125
..."Your body has to be in prison, but
your mind can be wherever it wants."

01:16:15.768 --> 01:16:17.668
He tell you that?

01:16:21.473 --> 01:16:24.408
Listen, I brought you
some toilet paper...

01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:28.980
...in case, you know, you want
to write some poetry or something.

01:16:30.816 --> 01:16:34.946
Hey, Colonel Klink.
Let me out of here, man.

01:16:39.291 --> 01:16:42.124
Frank, man,
it wasn't your fault, okay?

01:16:42.494 --> 01:16:44.553
Remember that.

01:16:52.705 --> 01:16:57.642
Roberta, have Miss Lowell photographed
for an I.D. For visitation.

01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:00.608
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

01:17:00.779 --> 01:17:02.076
Yes, sir.

01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:07.276
- I want to make sure Frank's all right.
- He's fine. He's recovering.

01:17:07.453 --> 01:17:12.083
In three weeks he'll be out, and you can
look forward to a happy life together.

01:17:12.258 --> 01:17:15.625
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you, warden.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.564
Okay, look into the light.

01:17:32.378 --> 01:17:34.369
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

01:17:34.546 --> 01:17:38.243
Hi, come here, you.

01:17:38.884 --> 01:17:41.512
- I was so worried.
- You look great.

01:17:41.687 --> 01:17:46.386
Thirty-minute visit, Leone. Compliments
of the warden. Don't waste it.

01:17:46.558 --> 01:17:49.925
- How do you feel?
- Good, thanks, sweetheart.

01:17:50.129 --> 01:17:55.431
Thirty minutes. You need any help,
just give us a call, huh?

01:17:59.406 --> 01:18:03.206
- Are they all like that?
- Don't worry. You look great.

01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:04.673
You look...

01:18:04.844 --> 01:18:08.280
Don't tell me what I look like.
I can't stand it.

01:18:08.448 --> 01:18:11.508
I've missed you so much.

01:18:19.926 --> 01:18:23.692
No more separations. Promise?

01:18:23.897 --> 01:18:26.525
I promise.

01:18:43.216 --> 01:18:45.582
- Time's up.
- Nice view.

01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:48.447
- What's the matter with you?
- Time's up.

01:18:48.621 --> 01:18:51.954
- The warden said half an hour.
- He changed his mind.

01:18:53.093 --> 01:18:55.994
What do you mean?
I wanna talk to the warden.

01:18:56.196 --> 01:19:00.963
What you wanna do is keep your mouth
shut, fix your clothes and get out.

01:19:01.134 --> 01:19:03.728
- Come on.
- Don't touch her.

01:19:04.471 --> 01:19:06.769
What did you say?

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:11.775
- Don't touch her? You don't learn, pal.
- Hey, I'm leaving.

01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:19.710
Three weeks.
Three weeks. Three weeks.

01:19:47.047 --> 01:19:48.878
Leone.

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:51.375
Come here.

01:19:57.124 --> 01:19:58.352
Do I know you?

01:19:58.559 --> 01:20:02.051
No, you don't know me, Frank,
but I know you.

01:20:02.329 --> 01:20:04.763
I was at Treadmore with you.

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.894
A-block.

01:20:09.637 --> 01:20:13.164
- Treadmore don't have an A-block.
- That's right.

01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:17.140
- We got something else in common.
- Yeah, what's that?

01:20:17.344 --> 01:20:19.039
We're both getting out soon.

01:20:19.313 --> 01:20:23.909
You in a few weeks.
Me, I'm gone the day after tomorrow.

01:20:24.652 --> 01:20:26.643
What happened to you?

01:20:26.854 --> 01:20:29.652
One beating too many.

01:20:29.857 --> 01:20:34.794
I served some hard time in this place.
We both have, am I right?

01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:39.495
Yeah, you're right about that.

01:20:39.733 --> 01:20:43.931
You need anything when I get out?
Can I get you anything?

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:48.938
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.
- I'm just lucky, I guess.

01:20:49.109 --> 01:20:55.070
I got a job lined up. Temporary, but
it pays a grand for two hours of work.

01:20:55.316 --> 01:20:58.410
- That's not bad, is it?
- What do you gotta do?

01:21:01.956 --> 01:21:06.916
I just gotta rape this bitch. I get an
extra hundred every time she screams.

01:21:07.094 --> 01:21:10.723
- I'll kill you for that!
- Payback time, Frank.

01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:12.956
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead!

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.096
Hey, bailiff! Guard!
Guard! Somebody!

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:20.570
Manly! Manly! Guard!

01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:23.632
- What's your problem?
- I gotta use the phone.

01:21:23.811 --> 01:21:28.875
- You know your privileges. No phone.
- That guy is gonna kill my girlfriend.

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:31.484
- What guy?
- The guy that was just here.

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:36.283
- The guy in the wheelchair!
- What are you trying to pull, Leone?

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:39.950
Don't play with me, Manly.
Please, I gotta warn her.

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:44.121
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:49.293
Goddamn, you fat motherfucker!
Goddamn!

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:58.812
Hey, Frank. Doing some
spring-cleaning, huh, man?

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:02.008
Dallas, come here.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.013
Yeah?

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:10.958
- What is it, man?
- I need some help.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:13.617
No questions asked.

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:19.296
You're busting out?
You got less than three weeks.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:20.695
Just help me.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:24.133
- This is gonna take days.
- I need it tonight.

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:27.831
I can't do that.
Everything is gonna be locked up.

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:31.410
There's a con getting
out of here tomorrow.

01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:35.138
- Chink Weber paid him to get Melissa.
- I understand.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:40.719
I'd love to help, but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting my arm.

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:49.291
I'll take you with me.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.857
No shit?

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.031
- What's the plan?
- You'll know when you gotta know.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.307
Going for the tunnels, huh, man?

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:04.842
You just be here, all right?

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.380
Convict, move it out of there!

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:13.386
Hey, use some bleach on that, Frank.
I'm coming out, Colonel Klink.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:18.754
Linen run.

01:23:18.928 --> 01:23:22.261
- Evening, Officer Vazquez.
- You're late. Get in there.

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:23.726
- Yes, sir.
- Quick.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.060
- I'll be real quick.
- Still making that jailhouse booze?

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:31.670
Absolutely not, sir. I'm on the wagon.
I joined Alcoholics Unanimous.

01:23:31.907 --> 01:23:34.774
- You got some line of shit.
- It's bad on my nervous system.

01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:37.673
- Makes me talk too much.
- Just make it quick.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.213
Yeah, I'll be right out, sir.
Right out.

01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:51.226
No. Help! Oh, shit!

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:55.587
Help me!

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.395
Come on, Frank. Let's go.

01:23:59.635 --> 01:24:01.865
Okay, come on. That's it.

01:24:05.241 --> 01:24:08.574
- All right, we got 10 minutes. Move it.
- All right.

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:10.711
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick.

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:12.937
- Frank?
- Come on.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:15.012
The tools, man.

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:30.430
You got it.

01:24:32.601 --> 01:24:35.035
Okay, here I go.

01:24:35.938 --> 01:24:38.133
Oh, God. I'm jumping.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:43.602
Man, there's rats in here.

01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:57.416
- All right. I'm all right. No!
- What?

01:24:57.594 --> 01:25:00.859
- This way. It's a shortcut to the plant.
- It's this way.

01:25:01.064 --> 01:25:06.297
No, man, I remember the map.
It's this way. I'm positive. Let's go!

01:25:24.321 --> 01:25:26.016
D.T.A., Frank.

01:25:28.024 --> 01:25:31.357
Ain't that what you taught me, man?
D.T.A.

01:25:31.528 --> 01:25:34.019
Right on schedule, Frank.

01:25:34.231 --> 01:25:36.825
I'm sorry, man.
You were my ticket out of here.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.391
Damn you!

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.643
You had me set up the whole time?!

01:25:47.844 --> 01:25:52.907
Not the whole time. I got
30 years to go, man. Thirty years.

01:25:53.884 --> 01:25:56.546
The warden made me a deal.

01:25:57.888 --> 01:25:59.913
Dumb bastard!

01:26:00.157 --> 01:26:02.182
They made me a deal, man!
A deal!

01:26:02.392 --> 01:26:05.691
We don't make deals
with escaping prisoners.

01:26:08.665 --> 01:26:11.190
What the hell are you talking about?

01:26:11.434 --> 01:26:13.902
- You said if I delivered...
- Shut up.

01:26:14.171 --> 01:26:17.663
- You're going back to the population.
- Population?

01:26:17.874 --> 01:26:21.207
You can't do this to me, warden.
You can't do this.

01:26:21.444 --> 01:26:24.538
I snitched him off.
They're gonna kill me. I'm finished.

01:26:24.714 --> 01:26:26.579
Tough.

01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:30.750
Look, I came through, goddamn it!
We had a deal!

01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:35.751
That's enough.
You're gonna kill him.

01:26:37.294 --> 01:26:38.488
That's enough.

01:26:45.036 --> 01:26:47.869
This is an automatic 10 years, Frank.

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:51.530
It's 10 years for a second
escape attempt.

01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:55.372
I knew you'd cross the line. I told
them you were a hard-core criminal.

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:59.778
They'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

01:26:59.984 --> 01:27:03.545
You better believe that you'll
be doing hard time here...

01:27:03.788 --> 01:27:06.222
...for the rest of your life.

01:27:07.558 --> 01:27:09.753
Manly, you know what to do.

01:27:22.974 --> 01:27:24.965
Some dealmaker.

01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:35.213
See...

01:27:35.486 --> 01:27:37.954
...shit does float, doesn't it?

01:27:38.222 --> 01:27:40.053
Hey, you know what else?

01:27:40.224 --> 01:27:44.422
You don't have to worry about
that psycho hurting your girlfriend.

01:27:44.662 --> 01:27:48.098
We decided to keep him in here.
Didn't we, officer?

01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.908
She's not my type.

01:28:01.746 --> 01:28:01.846
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

01:28:01.846 --> 01:28:04.644
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

01:28:04.882 --> 01:28:09.251
Turn on the steam.
Turn on the fucking steam!

01:28:09.453 --> 01:28:11.045
Put him in it.

01:28:11.355 --> 01:28:13.152
Get him in there.

01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:21.894
Bring him in here! Come on!

01:28:27.673 --> 01:28:29.641
Come on!

01:28:38.283 --> 01:28:40.274
Rape this.

01:28:42.821 --> 01:28:47.690
My face! My face is burning!
My face!

01:29:03.308 --> 01:29:05.071
I'll kill you!

01:29:30.836 --> 01:29:32.827
School's out, punk.

01:30:31.497 --> 01:30:33.089
Frank.

01:30:35.134 --> 01:30:37.762
Frank, don't leave me here, man.

01:30:46.112 --> 01:30:47.909
I'm sorry.

01:30:48.614 --> 01:30:50.605
Take me with you.

01:31:11.137 --> 01:31:13.367
Let him go, Manly.

01:31:13.639 --> 01:31:15.436
Let him go.

01:31:23.749 --> 01:31:25.876
What are you gonna do with that?

01:31:26.152 --> 01:31:27.813
You okay, Frank?

01:31:28.387 --> 01:31:30.218
I'm okay, Dallas.

01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:34.218
You can trust me, Frank.
You can trust me.

01:31:34.494 --> 01:31:37.554
- Put it down, Dallas.
- Put it down.

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:41.493
- I won't hurt you anymore.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:43.603 --> 01:31:47.471
- You don't wanna do it.
- You fat piece of shit.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.005
Don't do it, Dallas.

01:31:49.609 --> 01:31:53.171
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- Dallas, don't.

01:31:54.882 --> 01:31:57.749
- You won't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:58.051 --> 01:32:02.112
- You don't got the balls to do it, punk.
- You're wrong.

01:32:02.289 --> 01:32:04.757
- Stoolie.
- You're wrong.

01:32:05.692 --> 01:32:07.751
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

01:32:08.028 --> 01:32:09.427
No!

01:32:27.781 --> 01:32:31.649
Switch to backup. Sir, we've got
a power outage in C-wing.

01:32:32.386 --> 01:32:34.820
Get some men to that utility quarter.

01:32:58.545 --> 01:33:02.675
You better have a good reason for not
telling me you knew Leone was escaping.

01:33:02.849 --> 01:33:05.579
I've got a dead officer and
a dead inmate.

01:33:05.819 --> 01:33:08.014
And I don't have any answers.
Do you?

01:33:08.188 --> 01:33:11.715
I was trying to save an informant's
life by keeping it secret.

01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:16.352
Why would a man who's got
three weeks to go try to break out?

01:33:16.663 --> 01:33:19.257
We can ask him
when we catch him.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:43.381
Busted cable, utility corridor.
He's going to the roof.

01:35:14.682 --> 01:35:16.707
Bring up zone two.

01:35:17.552 --> 01:35:19.452
Can't you get any more light in there?

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.020
Captain Meissner.

01:35:21.190 --> 01:35:23.385
This is Osner.
I'm in the well room.

01:35:23.525 --> 01:35:25.686
Looks like this is where he went out.

01:35:36.505 --> 01:35:39.633
Sir, that has got to be at least
200 yards underwater.

01:35:39.842 --> 01:35:42.970
- Do you really think he made it?
- Maybe not, Mr. Braden.

01:35:43.245 --> 01:35:45.770
But until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

01:35:45.948 --> 01:35:48.940
- This is Drumgoole. I want sector four.
- Meissner, sector four.

01:35:49.118 --> 01:35:52.349
- What do you have?
- Right now, nothing, sir.

01:35:52.588 --> 01:35:55.955
I'm thinking of calling in the
local and state police.

01:35:56.225 --> 01:36:00.924
No! No outside agencies.
I repeat, no outside agencies.

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:04.725
This is an internal matter.
He's alive, I want him.

01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:09.063
- Arm a tactical squad and meet me.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:09.972 --> 01:36:14.033
Mr. Braden, you will
continue this search.

01:36:36.665 --> 01:36:39.065
You won't get away with it.

01:36:40.569 --> 01:36:42.400
You know that, don't you?

01:36:43.772 --> 01:36:45.967
I could've got out.

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:51.209
But I'm not going to spend my life...

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.075
...running from you.

01:36:59.421 --> 01:37:01.389
Paul, look at this.

01:37:04.593 --> 01:37:06.221
Get your ass inside.

01:37:06.496 --> 01:37:08.487
Whoa, hold it.

01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:12.293
- You can't use me as a hostage...
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:15.402
You recognize that chair?

01:37:15.672 --> 01:37:19.938
You built it, didn't you?
Now get in there. Get in there!

01:37:20.176 --> 01:37:22.440
Don't even think about moving.

01:37:25.448 --> 01:37:29.748
You think you're gonna take me
to hell, huh? I'll show you hell!

01:37:31.421 --> 01:37:33.912
All right, over there.

01:37:34.424 --> 01:37:36.221
Move your leg!

01:37:36.526 --> 01:37:40.826
Dallas, he fried,
the way you're gonna fry.

01:37:42.265 --> 01:37:47.464
First Base, you took him downstairs,
you broke his goddamn neck!

01:37:50.039 --> 01:37:55.033
I'm gonna fry your brains.
What do you know? It's a perfect fit.

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:57.903
Move! Move!

01:37:59.382 --> 01:38:03.819
You can't make this work.
You're not smart enough. You're stupid.

01:38:03.987 --> 01:38:05.420
You're scum.

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:08.557
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

01:38:09.792 --> 01:38:13.558
You can't kill a man. You're not
a murderer. You don't have the guts.

01:38:19.469 --> 01:38:22.302
Ten more years.
Isn't that what you said?

01:38:23.239 --> 01:38:25.002
How about 20?

01:38:25.475 --> 01:38:26.908
How about 30?

01:38:27.176 --> 01:38:31.670
No, it doesn't matter what they give
me because you won't be satisfied...

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:33.313
...till you got me for life.

01:38:33.483 --> 01:38:35.474
Make a hole.

01:38:35.752 --> 01:38:37.310
Take it down!

01:38:39.689 --> 01:38:41.884
I ain't doing life for nothing.

01:38:43.159 --> 01:38:45.389
Come on. Lean on it, man!

01:38:45.595 --> 01:38:48.428
They're gonna break that door down.

01:38:48.665 --> 01:38:51.533
And they're going to take
your skull apart!

01:38:51.702 --> 01:38:54.762
You're going to beg me
to let them kill you.

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:57.539
- Come on, break it down!
- Meissner!

01:38:59.043 --> 01:39:01.102
Harder, man. Harder!

01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:07.344
Come on, lean on it.

01:39:07.851 --> 01:39:09.443
No!

01:39:11.288 --> 01:39:12.846
No!

01:39:14.959 --> 01:39:16.517
Take out the glass!

01:39:19.730 --> 01:39:21.789
Shoot! Shoot me!

01:39:21.966 --> 01:39:23.433
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot!

01:39:23.634 --> 01:39:26.068
He has his hand taped to the lever.

01:39:26.537 --> 01:39:28.004
No!

01:39:28.505 --> 01:39:32.532
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:34.041
Come on, shoot!

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.038
Hold your fire!

01:39:41.018 --> 01:39:43.646
Relax. Just relax.

01:39:44.488 --> 01:39:47.889
Glad you're here, Meissner. This
wouldn't be official without witnesses.

01:39:48.058 --> 01:39:53.052
He's bluffing. He's wants me to take
responsibility for his escape attempt.

01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:57.061
I don't want a confession.
You set me up. You set everything up!

01:39:57.234 --> 01:40:01.568
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Chink Weber!

01:40:01.772 --> 01:40:03.467
The goons.

01:40:03.907 --> 01:40:06.774
The cop that was gonna rape Melissa.

01:40:07.578 --> 01:40:08.875
Dallas.

01:40:09.847 --> 01:40:12.213
The killing of the kid.

01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:15.341
Guilty on all counts.

01:40:15.519 --> 01:40:20.684
Prove it! That's your problem.
You can't prove anything.

01:40:20.858 --> 01:40:25.420
I don't have to prove nothing.
I came here for an execution.

01:40:25.596 --> 01:40:28.895
I demand to be released from here!

01:40:29.933 --> 01:40:31.366
No!

01:40:31.535 --> 01:40:35.996
Don't do it, Leone. Don't do it.
Take it easy.

01:40:36.708 --> 01:40:40.007
You deserve payback.

01:40:40.211 --> 01:40:41.610
Frank!

01:40:43.782 --> 01:40:45.773
Please, Frank.

01:40:47.052 --> 01:40:50.783
Don't kill me. It's true.

01:40:53.792 --> 01:40:57.284
I confess, Mr. Meissner.

01:40:57.562 --> 01:41:00.429
Everything that he said was true.

01:41:00.665 --> 01:41:03.532
I set him up. Everything.

01:41:07.272 --> 01:41:08.739
Please.

01:41:10.075 --> 01:41:12.270
Don't kill me.

01:41:13.778 --> 01:41:14.972
Don't...

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:21.118
See you in hell, Drumgoole.

01:41:38.002 --> 01:41:40.436
Works better with this.

01:41:42.373 --> 01:41:44.739
Take him to the hole, Mr. Meissner.

01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:49.206
Mr. Braden, take the prisoner
to the hole.

01:41:49.481 --> 01:41:51.312
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:51.583 --> 01:41:55.849
Somebody get me
out of this chair.

01:41:57.355 --> 01:41:58.788
Come on.

01:42:03.228 --> 01:42:07.824
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

01:42:07.999 --> 01:42:09.830
I can't do that.

01:42:10.535 --> 01:42:12.332
Take the warden into custody.

01:42:12.537 --> 01:42:15.631
- I said take him. What are you doing?
- Cuff him.

01:42:15.907 --> 01:42:21.312
Stop it! I am warden of this institution,
and you will obey... Stop that!

01:42:21.747 --> 01:42:27.014
That was just a stupid confession to
try and save my life. Are you crazy?

01:42:27.419 --> 01:42:29.649
No, but you are.

01:42:29.922 --> 01:42:35.053
Until this matter's resolved in a judicial
inquiry, you'll remain in our custody.

01:42:37.396 --> 01:42:40.058
I'll have your ass for this.

01:42:40.332 --> 01:42:43.824
I'll have your ass.

01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:46.531
Move him!

01:42:57.950 --> 01:43:00.578
I only wanted to do my time, captain.

01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.511
You'll get your chance.

01:43:03.689 --> 01:43:05.782
Move him.

01:43:25.611 --> 01:43:27.704
Hey, Ernie.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.745
Hang in there, Frank.

01:43:30.115 --> 01:43:31.605
Hey, Frank?

01:43:31.784 --> 01:43:33.775
- Eclipse.
- Take care.

01:43:33.953 --> 01:43:36.581
You too. Thanks a lot, big man.

01:43:36.755 --> 01:43:39.952
Yeah. That okay?

01:43:40.125 --> 01:43:41.888
It's all right.

01:43:44.263 --> 01:43:49.064
Got this one from
Fidel Castro himself.

01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:53.932
- See you, big man.
- Okay.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.860
Hold it.

01:44:16.162 --> 01:44:18.995
Crack the outside!

01:44:19.866 --> 01:44:23.734
- Know what I'll miss most about you?
- What's that?

01:44:24.604 --> 01:44:27.368
