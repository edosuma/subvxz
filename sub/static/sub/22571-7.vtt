WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:02.803
- Well, you know,
today we're going back

00:02.903 --> 00:06.140
to Placentia and last time
I was in Placentia,

00:06.240 --> 00:08.109
I did really good.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.278
14, 15, 16 rods.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.713
I haven't ever hit this much
fishing gear in one unit.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.582
This is why I still do this.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.685
You know, they say you can't
fish the same spot twice.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.453
But I'm gonna prove that wrong.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.423
Hopefully, I can strike while
the fishing's still hot,

00:22.523 --> 00:23.991
Where there's one,
there's two,

00:24.092 --> 00:26.026
Where there's two,
there's usually none.

00:26.127 --> 00:30.831
And I'm only on two, so I'm
sure I'm gonna find something.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.434
Wow. Figure that one out.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.906
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:39.006 --> 00:41.275
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:41.375 --> 00:42.776
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:42.876 --> 00:44.778
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.114
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.448
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:47.548 --> 00:49.150
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.684
- You shut your face.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.853
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.021
- We're back, baby!

00:58.092 --> 00:59.393
- Hi, Kenny.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.062
- What's up with
your stunt double?

01:03.664 --> 01:04.798
- That's my brother.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.334
I got my little brother
here with me

01:06.434 --> 01:09.036
to see maybe if he could
bring me some good luck.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.205
- Hi, brother.
- Y'all come in twos,

01:11.305 --> 01:12.573
so I had to bring backup.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.675
- You do need probably
a third guy then if you're...

01:14.775 --> 01:15.676
- Yeah.
- Trying to hang with us.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.744
- At least three.

01:16.844 --> 01:17.745
- You don't want
the third one.

01:17.845 --> 01:18.846
- You don't want that one.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.514
- Yeah.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.150
- Jarrod.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.785
What's your name?
- Kevin.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.655
- He mad 'cause I made him pay
$200 for the T-shirt.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.123
- Ooooh.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.126
- You charged him
for the shirt?

01:32.226 --> 01:33.994
- Yeah.
- Yes, he did.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.629
- Logic, straight up.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.998
- You need me to get you
a lounge chair?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.067
- No, I need that info
you got, girl.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.771
- What's in them units.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.807
- Kenny can try and charge me
all he wants.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.075
He's gonna find out
about the lockers

01:48.176 --> 01:49.610
when everybody else does.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.614
I don't know.
We're gonna find out together.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.619
- Yeah, it says you do it.
What's it?

01:58.719 --> 02:00.454
- Everything I ain't
supposed to be doing.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.290
- Which starts with A
and ends with Z.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.657
- Yeah.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.926
- A is "eat a apple."

02:07.127 --> 02:08.061
- "Go to the zoo."

02:09.930 --> 02:12.099
And everything in between?
- Everything.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.667
- Is there anything
you don't do?

02:13.767 --> 02:16.604
- Yeah, I ain't getting on
no ladder.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.242
- So, like, rescuing a kitten

02:21.342 --> 02:23.344
from a tree, not gonna happen.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.379
- And swimming.
That ain't gonna happen.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.317
So, like, saving a drowning
baby, you can't do it.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.618
- I call 911 for him.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.454
- You afraid it's gonna
mess up your hair?

02:33.554 --> 02:36.257
- Ain't no sense in
both of us dying.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.692
- Oh, no!

02:38.792 --> 02:40.961
- All right, guys, thank you
for coming out today

02:41.061 --> 02:42.663
to Placentia Self Storage.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.765
Once I open the door,
you can't go in

02:44.865 --> 02:46.234
and you can't touch anything.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.801
This is a cash-only auction
and you can buy today,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.303
so if you guys are ready,
so am I.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.471
Let's go!

02:54.808 --> 02:58.446
*

02:59.547 --> 03:01.014
Here we go.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.016
*

03:03.116 --> 03:05.719
- All right, here we go.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.955
Couple boxes, clothes.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.089
I'm gonna go on this one.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.758
- You do what
you need to do.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.192
- That's a good locker.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.461
- Yeah.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.229
- Mmm, we'll be the judge.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.165
- Oh, wow. Is that
a Louis Vuitton suitcase?

03:18.266 --> 03:21.269
- Is that a new, brand-new,
nice cardboard box?

03:21.369 --> 03:23.637
Actually, it is
a really brand-new,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.105
nice cardboard box.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.375
- Oh, my God, I feel like this
is us, like, on a road trip.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.509
This is the
we would bring.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.311
- This is a yes.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.646
- Damn, look at.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.283
- If anything, we can get those
suitcases for 50 bucks.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.285
What you think
is in the box?

03:37.385 --> 03:38.286
- Clothes.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.453
It's nothing .

03:39.553 --> 03:40.721
- You can see through
the boxes?

03:40.821 --> 03:41.889
- Well, that's what you
can do with your eyes.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.457
Tell me, tell me what you see.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.394
Don't have to be all
mean.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.795
- Hey, you asked.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.398
- I asked for your opinion,
not your attitude.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.965
Don't make me tell Mama.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.601
- It is a nice suitcase.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.536
- Yeah, got the built-in lock.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.838
- Mm-hmm. Still has
the plastic on it.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.072
- Hold on, let me check it out.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.842
It's full.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.210
- Get out of there!

04:03.311 --> 04:05.479
I knew I--I knew I could
not leave you unattended.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.647
You are...

04:06.747 --> 04:07.648
- Yeah, I told you
to watch out.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.749
- Come on, get out.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.750
- Worst lookout
in the business.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.884
- Get out.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.152
- Worst lookout
in the business.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.153
- You guys, always breaking
the rules.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.389
- Sorry.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.591
- Hey, Emily, um,
our strategy...

04:17.691 --> 04:20.027
um, you're gonna see us
shrug our shoulders.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.095
- A little shoulder action,
and so that way,

04:22.195 --> 04:23.464
you know what I'm saying,
we got to like...

04:23.564 --> 04:24.565
- Don't leave us hanging there
looking crazy.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.566
- We got to bamboozle them.
Yes.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.867
- Okay. Sounds good.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.168
- So if you see a seizure,
it's a bid.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.503
We got to get a edge
on these buyers.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.339
- We're hoping a little
discrete shoulder shake

04:31.439 --> 04:32.506
will give it to 'em.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.941
- All righty, guys,
here we go.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.578
25!

04:37.678 --> 04:38.579
- Yeah!

04:38.679 --> 04:40.881
50, 75!

04:40.981 --> 04:42.516
- Give 'em a little shimmy.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.419
- Damn it.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.220
- Oh, is that what
she's doing?

04:47.321 --> 04:48.221
125!

04:48.322 --> 04:52.526
150, 175...

04:52.626 --> 04:53.727
- You got to watch
those two, man.

04:53.827 --> 04:54.895
- 200!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.136
Or am I?

05:03.236 --> 05:04.772
- Are you bidding
or dancing?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.006
- Dancing.
- Oh.

05:06.106 --> 05:09.009
- 250, 275...

05:09.109 --> 05:10.511
- God sakes!

05:10.611 --> 05:12.880
- Now 275, 300...

05:12.980 --> 05:15.449
Now 325...

05:15.549 --> 05:18.251
Now 350...

05:18.352 --> 05:19.820
- Don't get in the middle
of this battle.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.724
You want back in?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.859
Sold it to you, $350.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.661
Darrell wins it.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.197
You got chicken shoulders
over there.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.665
- I have a condition.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.033
- Oh, we know.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.636
Well, let's just get
right down to it.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.438
Those Vegas ladies
should know better

05:37.538 --> 05:38.806
than to go up against me.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.975
I mean, hello?
I am the gambler.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.844
Got some jackets, some shirts--

05:43.944 --> 05:47.981
there's probably 50 bucks just
in clothes in this bag.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.884
This is what made me go on
this locker right here.

05:50.984 --> 05:54.121
For some reason, this purse
or bag or...

05:54.221 --> 05:55.122
oh, boy.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.024
*

05:57.124 --> 05:58.526
Look at this right here.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.666
Wow. These are some
really nice watches.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.835
Ooh, look at that Rolex.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.369
Wow.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.704
If this is a real Rolex,

06:10.804 --> 06:15.375
my $350 locker could turn into
a $2,000 locker.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.244
Let's see if this...

06:17.344 --> 06:20.481
yeah, doesn't appear to be
self-winding.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.816
It's giving me a real
sneaky feeling

06:22.916 --> 06:25.419
this is probably a knockoff.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.188
Well, you can't fake
a good time.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.123
Look at this right here.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.726
This is a well-made
suitcase right here.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.228
Sweaters, T-shirts--

06:35.328 --> 06:38.666
$30 bill right there.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.267
Looks like we got
more clothes.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.636
Looks like we are
smuggling coffee.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.605
40 bucks.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.306
*

06:46.406 --> 06:48.175
I think I smell more coffee.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.811
Not smelling profits,
that's for sure.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.515
Clothes, shoes,
another 40 bucks here.

06:54.615 --> 06:59.086
This is looking like maybe
a break-even deal.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.422
Oh, wow, this big bag
is heavy.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.693
*

07:05.793 --> 07:08.829
Oh, boy. There's at least
100 pieces of clothes in here.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.064
Buck a piece, that's 100 bucks.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.900
But you know what?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.002
Those girls didn't get it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.369
I got it.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.639
Boy, did I get it.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.775
*

07:21.875 --> 07:24.678
- This unit has been here
for four years.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.679
Whoo!

07:25.779 --> 07:28.281
*

07:28.381 --> 07:29.850
- That is a huge clock.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.985
- This is exactly the unit
Kenny won't do.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.921
- He don't do ladders.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.823
- Kenny sure don't do it.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.358
- Christmas.
- Creepy baby dolls.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.360
- Pass.
- Pffft.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.296
- Oh, I wonder what time it is.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.833
- Look, a bag of creepy dolls
that we love.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.434
- Oh, creepy dolls.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.169
- There's some oskie goodies
in here.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
- Uh-oh. Look at the clock.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.773
I see what time it is.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.675
- It just says
German furniture.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.209
Oh.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.778
How that fool know his German?

07:57.878 --> 07:58.879
Hm.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.816
This is a lot
of sorting through

08:02.916 --> 08:04.618
and a lot of crap in the bags.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.219
You have an opening bid?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.521
- No.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.289
Would you like to give me one?
- I would.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.024
- Negative 25.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.025
- Okay.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.160
All right, guys, here we go.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.161
And what do you say there?

08:15.362 --> 08:16.429
- You better step up.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.531
.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.668
- Yeah, 25.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.937
- 25, 30...

08:25.038 --> 08:27.040
Is that a bid? 35, now 40.

08:29.977 --> 08:30.911
40!
- Oh, my gosh.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.145
No one's bidding?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.182
35, 40?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.785
Sold it to you, $35
to the Vegas ladies.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.187
- Yes!

08:40.287 --> 08:42.189
- You rolled the dice
on that one.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.191
to the Vegas ladies.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.393
- I get it, I get it.
You don't have to explain that.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.129
10 by 21.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.497
- 10 by 21.

08:50.598 --> 08:55.803
*

08:55.903 --> 08:58.171
- Whoa! Look at all this stuff.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.641
Gobs of boxes in the back.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.342
All the furniture's cheap,
though.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.411
I wish the furniture was good.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.513
They gonna put
the Backstreet Boy

09:06.614 --> 09:08.515
right in the front,
knowing I'ma catch it.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.584
They think Ken gonna
want that unit.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.285
What you see, Calvin?

09:12.385 --> 09:13.821
- Another episode
of "Sanford and Son"

09:13.921 --> 09:15.088
if you buy this junk.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.459
- Well, well, well.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.361
- I think we have all
of the Backstreet Boys

09:21.461 --> 09:22.630
and Celine Dion collection.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.832
- Right.
- I do see some cool furniture,

09:24.932 --> 09:27.567
but I don't know if that's
what we're interested in.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.936
- Wow.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.739
This is quite a mix here.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.841
- Little vacuum...
- Furniture...

09:35.408 --> 09:37.210
I like that it's clean
and there's a lot of boxes.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.212
- There's a lot of stuff.
All right.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.148
- You think I could
be the third brother?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.250
- Yeah.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.852
- Yeah.
- You look better shaved.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.519
- No, he doesn't.
- He does.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.188
- That's what you
tell all the girls.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.324
- [snorting,
snickering]

09:51.424 --> 09:52.993
- I don't always bring her
with me, man.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.695
Sometimes it's too much.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.363
- Here we go.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.464
And what do you say to 500?

09:57.564 --> 09:59.099
500...

09:59.199 --> 10:00.467
!

10:00.567 --> 10:01.769
- Hmm.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.270
- Mm-mm.
- 50 bucks.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.271
- 50, 75...

10:08.241 --> 10:11.078
100! 125...

10:12.512 --> 10:14.648
- Yeah.

10:14.748 --> 10:15.649
- I'm saying it now.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.417
- All right.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.152
- 125, 150!

10:19.252 --> 10:21.188
150,

10:21.288 --> 10:23.323
175, now 200.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.300
200? Sold it to you.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.468
Jarrod and Brandi got it
for $175.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.872
$175. Thanks, guys.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.208
- Finally! Eight years,
and you made some money.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.076
- Yeah.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.479
'Cause with Darrell, it feels
like an eternity.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.182
*

10:49.282 --> 10:50.784
- Yup.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.686
- I'm not bringing
my brother no more.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.222
He's bad luck.
Plus, he won't shut up.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.490
Let's go eat.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.893
- Eh, I've been taking care
of you all my life.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.629
- Helping you fight
and all that.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.997
- That was one fight.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.665
- You should be paying me
for saving your life.

11:05.766 --> 11:11.204
- Don't talk about it.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.439
- All right, so...

11:12.539 --> 11:15.375
- Ah, 273, 273.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.412
Girl, talk about the ultimate
thrift deal.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.548
We did shake up
the competition today.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.450
- It kinda feels like
we stole this locker.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.753
- First, this bag of goodness.
- Okay.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.622
- We love us some creepy dolls.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.492
Oh, my God, I'm gonna turn you
into the scene of "E.T."

11:32.592 --> 11:34.427
- Okay.
- There you go.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.263
You think we can sell
any of that stuff?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.298
- There's a few missing heads.
I'm a little concerned.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.533
- Oh, look.
Shana, I have a gift for you.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.803
- I get a stocking!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.271
- Mm-hmm.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.039
Oh, it's a table--I thought it
was gonna be, like, a mirror

11:46.139 --> 11:47.540
or a portrait.
- So did I.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.109
Ohhh.
- Oh, look at it.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.845
- Ooh, it's one that opens in
the middle like the Red Sea.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.313
- Oh, okay.
- This is like a Red Sea table.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.215
All right.
- Okay.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.416
Oh, my God, lookit.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.485
60 bucks?
- At least.

11:58.585 --> 11:59.987
- Done. 60 bucks.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.623
- This is actually beautiful.
Look at these knobs.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.692
- Look what's inside.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.693
Ooh, what's in here?

12:06.794 --> 12:07.961
Look what I found.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.197
Aw, remember?
- Oh, I remember those.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.166
- Now you do everything
on your phone, oh my gosh.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.201
Kids don't even know
what this is.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.235
- No, they actually don't.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.506
- We might have gotten
a bad unit.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.475
- Hold on.
Check everything.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.744
- I see games, I see frames...

12:24.845 --> 12:25.979
- We got personal stuff...

12:26.079 --> 12:27.180
ooooh!

12:27.280 --> 12:28.715
What the hell?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.918
Let's see.
- Oh, my God.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.921
Oh, it's a baby head.
Shut up.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.657
I think there's
something else back here.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.726
- Another baby head. Shut up.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.028
- Oh, my gosh.
- Shut up!

12:41.128 --> 12:43.630
There's more?!
- Oh, my gosh.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.200
A third baby head?
- Oh, my goodness!

12:47.300 --> 12:48.601
This is beautiful, actually.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.437
- I don't know, it looks
kind of possessed, though.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.172
Look at the eyes.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.406
Oh, my gosh, what is this,
fertility?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.607
Is it a sign of fertility?

12:56.176 --> 12:58.278
Oh, my God, Edwina,
what if they're ancient?!

12:58.378 --> 13:00.447
- These creepy
baby doll heads,

13:00.547 --> 13:01.815
they might pay off after all.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.616
- And this is--
this is actually gorgeous.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.818
- This is gorgeous.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.920
- We could sell this
for, like, $200.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.389
- You know twins
run in my family?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.825
- Hey, I think
it's a sign.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.560
- I can handle two
at once, girl.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.627
Oh, .

13:14.727 --> 13:16.129
- Yeah.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.531
I forgot that there was
a step there.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.470
I can't believe we
got it so cheap.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.704
- I know.
crazy.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.539
*

13:26.639 --> 13:28.641
- Jarrod and I bought
a locker full of clean boxes

13:28.741 --> 13:32.479
and pretty much every '90s CD
that I ever loved.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.215
Ah, we're gonna listen
to some CDs so hard.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.950
- James Taylor
and Backstreet Boys.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.818
The whole way.
- 98 Degrees.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.387
Spice Girls.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.355
- Price out those CDs.
Count 'em for me.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.061
- Um, yeah.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.496
For, like, nostalgia.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.730
160.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.966
- 160 at 50¢ each,

13:53.066 --> 13:54.667
80 bucks.
- Whoo!

13:54.767 --> 13:56.003
What is that?
Oh, it's a printer?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.770
- Shredder.
- Oh, a shredder.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.439
- Yeah, that's worth 20 bucks.

13:59.539 --> 14:03.376
- There's $20 of cooking stuff.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.845
- You know what sucks
about this unit?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.481
So far, everything.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.250
- Look at how they
wrapped these knives.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.618
That's genius.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.620
- Why do they have so much
kitchen stuff?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.022
Jesus.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.756
- Ooh, popcorn maker.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.825
Those are fun. Five bucks.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.193
- Fishing pole, tackle box,

14:20.293 --> 14:22.562
probably 25 bucks.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.965
- Train tracks.
- Train tracks!

14:25.065 --> 14:27.234
Oh, this is all train stuff.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.835
Awesome.
- Yeah.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.403
What do you think, 100 bucks
for all of it?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.239
- Maybe more.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.074
I'm gonna say 200 bucks
in this box.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.043
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.278
- Going in, babe.
Going in.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.279
- Don't do it.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.647
- I'm going in!

14:40.747 --> 14:43.883
- Oh, my God.
Look what I found.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.218
You're gonna be so excited.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.419
Tape!

14:46.519 --> 14:48.321
my life.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.326
finally

14:53.426 --> 14:54.661
get the band back together.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.496
- Oh, my God, we totally can.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.398
*

14:58.498 --> 14:59.632
- Brandi.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.670
- It's a musical instrument.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.671
- Oh, yeah!

15:04.771 --> 15:07.407
Yeah. Do you play it?

15:07.507 --> 15:08.641
- I don't have a clue.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.043
- Come on.
You can do it.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.411
I have faith in you.
- One, two, three, four!

15:11.511 --> 15:12.412
- I have faith in you.

15:13.947 --> 15:14.948
There you go, see?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.683
Making beautiful music already.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.388
- Do you think these...

15:22.489 --> 15:23.856
- Yeah.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.361
- Take this crate down.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.030
- This thing's cool.
We should have it checked out.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.631
- Let's check it out.
- All right.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.201
Old Spice.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.836
- Ugh!

15:36.936 --> 15:39.006
- What a dick.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.408
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.310
- I smell like your dad.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.214
I'm gonna smell like this
for like three days.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.982
- You smell like my papa.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.884
patting me.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.221
Jesus. You think
that's gonna wash off?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.057
It's not gonna wash off. God.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.692
Now older women are
gonna be attracted to me.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.465
- Edwina, look at that house.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.167
It's ridiculous.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.668
We got really
dolled up today.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.370
- Well, don't you ladies
look nice.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.540
- To go see Charlene,
of Dee's Place of Dolls.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.976
So we have these lovely heads.
- Interesting heads.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.445
Figurines, and we're like,

16:18.545 --> 16:19.646
maybe you can help us
figure it out.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.913
- Yes.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.182
- Well, they're not
really figurines.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.051
They're manufacturing pieces--

16:24.151 --> 16:27.554
injection mold pieces
for dolls.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.256
both: Cool.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.724
- These are probably the
original molds that they made

16:31.824 --> 16:33.660
for a vinyl doll.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.462
I would say probably
you're looking

16:35.562 --> 16:37.197
at maybe in the '60s.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.998
- Oh.
- For vinyl. Oh, wow.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.200
- We were thinking, like, "Wow,

16:40.300 --> 16:41.901
this is a rough toy
for a child."

16:42.001 --> 16:43.303
- It's an artifact.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.072
- You know, these don't
have any names in 'em,

16:45.172 --> 16:49.976
so they probably were not
a real prominent company.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.380
Prominent makers and stuff
always put their name in it,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.082
usually on the back
of the head here.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.151
- Well...

16:58.251 --> 17:01.154
they probably--it was probably
another pieces.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.689
It's another one
of these molds.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.857
- Wow. Now, do they still
use these type of things?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.159
- Sure, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.594
Nothing's changed?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.896
- Uh, not really.
Not in vinyl.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.732
This doll here--
this is a flange head, okay?

17:12.832 --> 17:14.734
A flange head goes
onto a cloth body.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.336
- Okay, yeah, so that's
what we always see, yeah.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.337
- That makes sense.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.605
- So then the legs

17:18.705 --> 17:20.140
and the arms would be vinyl.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.041
- Do you find that
people collect these?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.511
- I would consider it like
a piece of doll history.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.280
both: A piece of doll history!
- Yes!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.518
- Um, they're not
in bad shape.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.919
They haven't been dented.

17:33.019 --> 17:33.986
I think...

17:34.087 --> 17:36.022
*

17:36.123 --> 17:38.658
Probably $900 for all of them.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.527
- Oh, my...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.195
Seriously, seriously?!

17:42.295 --> 17:43.930
I like big bucks
and I cannot lie.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.932
Baby's got us back.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.269
- Little mannequin dolls.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.573
- Where's the address
on this place?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.008
After doing some research,
we found out this instrument's

17:56.109 --> 17:58.111
actually used by
Foley artists.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.879
- Wow. It's like
an obstacle course.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.282
- So we're meeting Gregg
Barbanell at a Foley stage...

18:02.382 --> 18:03.316
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.084
- I'm good.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.719
- To see this thing in action.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.291
- Uh, some sort of musical
instrument, right?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.525
- It is a musical instrument.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.760
It's also used to make
sound effects,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.094
which is what we do in here.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.197
- No.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.167
Every imaginable sound,
starting with footsteps.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.237
- Yes.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.438
- You're standing on it.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.506
There's a tile surface
right there.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.544
That's how I sound
when I walk.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.746
Do you do footsteps on dirt?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.114
- We got dirt right here.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.850
What?!
Look at that.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.819
- So yeah, we got all
these different surfaces.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.454
I have all my different shoes.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.456
- Do you have, like,
creaky floor?

18:43.556 --> 18:44.724
- We do have a creaky floor.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.526
*

18:46.626 --> 18:49.162
So this is a waterphone.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.231
They call it a waterphone
because it was actually

18:51.331 --> 18:53.400
invented by a guy named
Richard Waters.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.268
- They are rare.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.371
This is the model
they call the whale song,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.540
which is kinda funny because
in the '70s,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.475
they actually used one of these

19:02.575 --> 19:03.943
to call whales.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.814
- Oh, that's crazy.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.149
- Sounds like a scary movie
from the '60s.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.519
- It does kinda sound
like a scary movie, yeah.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.521
- And you can hear this
in the movie "Poltergeist."

19:14.621 --> 19:17.290
You can hear it in "Star Trek,"
the movie.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.892
But what we really
need to do is,

19:19.992 --> 19:21.194
let's put some water in it.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.096
*

19:24.197 --> 19:25.632
- Let's put some water in it.

19:25.732 --> 19:29.269
- That's what gives it
the kind of creepy sounds.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.371
You can either strike it
with a mallet,

19:31.471 --> 19:32.539
or you can bow it.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.746
.
- That was a whale sound.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.649
- Yeah.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.386
- Cool.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.221
Um, can you tell me
how much it's worth?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.790
- Well, this thing
is beautiful.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.660
Um, probably...

19:59.766 --> 20:01.501
- Probably about $1,000.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.271
Oh, my God.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.273
The buildup on that
was spectacular!

20:06.373 --> 20:08.841
- Wait, can you say it
in your whale voice?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.978
- Probably about $1,000.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.782
announcer: Jarrod and Brandi
waterphoned it in

20:15.882 --> 20:17.650
with 12 C notes.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.453
Edwina and Shana got
ahead of the game

20:20.553 --> 20:22.489
thanks to their doll molds.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.558
Kenny Crossley had no love
for the lockers

20:25.658 --> 20:27.727
and even less love
for his brother...

20:27.827 --> 20:29.028
- Don't talk about it.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.264
- While Darrell Sheets
got shook

20:31.364 --> 20:33.600
by the competition.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.368
- Look at.
Oh, .

20:35.468 --> 20:36.669
You used to be a dancer, huh?

20:36.769 --> 20:39.071
- Mm-hmm.
- Michael Jackstone.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.473
Eee-hee.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.174
I used to do that to dance
to school, remember?

20:42.275 --> 20:43.443
- I wasn't gonna say it.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.378
You used to float around
in a tutu.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.048
- Don't make me start, girl.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.783
- Oh, wait, wait!

20:50.883 --> 20:52.485
- You got me butterflyin'
around.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.454
- Aww.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.323
,
there she did it.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.791
- Yeah.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.226
- It's a battle.
This is a battle.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.662
Kumbaya.
