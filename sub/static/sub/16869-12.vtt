<i>BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.360 --> 00:08.761
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:08.920 --> 00:11.491
<i>but secretly, with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:11.640 --> 00:14.007
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:14.760 --> 00:17.525
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

00:17.680 --> 00:19.682
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.286
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

00:22.440 --> 00:23.680
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

00:23.840 --> 00:26.969
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

00:27.120 --> 00:29.441
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

00:29.600 --> 00:31.841
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:33.961
HARRISON: Previously on The Flash...

00:34.120 --> 00:36.487
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

00:36.680 --> 00:38.170
<i>I accidentally ran to the future.</i>

00:38.320 --> 00:39.924
<i>I saw Savitar murder you.</i>

00:40.080 --> 00:41.366
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
-I'm not.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.564
If you guys got something going on,
I hope you know you can talk to me.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.882
Every night when I go to bed,
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up...

00:47.040 --> 00:48.041
<i>Her.</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:51.807
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.122
So, you're telling me
that every time I'm blacking out--

00:54.320 --> 00:55.321
<i>BARRY". You've become Alchemy.</i>

00:55.480 --> 00:58.643
Alchemy can restore the powers
that people had in Flashpoint.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.325
What Alchemy did was not your fault.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.482
I'm saying that at this point
in his training,

01:02.640 --> 01:04.129
you're faster than Barry.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.203
It's crazy how fast I've gotten
in such a short time.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.486
And I'm gonna need you
to get a lot faster.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.324
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar,

01:09.480 --> 01:10.527
you are.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.481
KID FLASH: So this is it, huh?

01:16.400 --> 01:19.244
Yeah, this is
the starting line to our race.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.129
Cisco's set up sensors
all along the course,

01:21.280 --> 01:22.327
and he'll be tracking our speed

01:22.480 --> 01:24.369
all the way to the finish line
on the other side of town.

01:24.720 --> 01:25.721
No, I meant, this is it,

01:25.880 --> 01:29.089
the day the greatest upset
in speedster history goes down.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.526
- Wally...
-(CHUCKLES)

01:30.680 --> 01:33.411
...man, this isn't
about winning or losing, okay?

01:33.560 --> 01:35.722
This is about training
so you can get faster

01:35.880 --> 01:37.609
and beat Savitar and save Iris.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.842
- Yeah. Which I'm gonna do.
-Okay.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.329
But first I'm gonna make you eat my dust.
I'm sorry.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.731
Okay, you know, there is a reason
they call me the fastest man alive.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.526
<i>Cisco, you good?</i>

01:48.960 --> 01:53.807
Ladies and gentlemen, the Central City
Speedster 500 is about to begin,

01:54.040 --> 01:58.762
but first, I've got five-to-one odds
Barry takes down Wally.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.922
- Any <i>takers?</i>
- Yeah. Game of speculation?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.401
Are we-- We're betting? Yeah. No, I'm in.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.728
On my Earth, financial wagering was banned

02:05.880 --> 02:08.723
after an unfortunate incident
with Vice President Al Capone.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.042
- Well, lucky for you, you live here now.
-Yes.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.441
Put me down for $20 for Barry.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.204
-(CHUCKLES) Joe, got to be in it. Come on.
-No, not me.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.084
That's a Sophie's Choice
I'm not gonna make.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.170
$80 on Barry.
Mama needs a new confocal microscope.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.368
All right, H.R.,
you put your life in my hands,

02:22.520 --> 02:24.727
so I know for a fact you like high stakes.
How much you in for?

02:25.240 --> 02:28.722
Wallace's recent speed tests
ensure that he is a lock.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.609
- Put me down for an Abe Lincoln.
-CAITLIN: Hmm?

02:30.960 --> 02:33.201
$100. Whatever $100 is on this Earth,
put me down for that.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.361
<i>THE FLASH: Guys, we're ready.</i>

02:34.520 --> 02:37.569

Ooh! Second marker, Wally's in the lead.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.531
- Yeah, Wallace! That's my boy.
-You mean, that's my boy.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.331
That's your boy. I wanna double down.
I wanna double down on that right now.

Oh! H.R., big spender. You serious?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.886
Serious? Serious as a heart attack, Rich.

- Oh!
-Oh-ho! Yes.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.361
Hmm?

03:44.640 --> 03:45.641
Now?

Come on, man! That didn't count.
You know I can't phase yet.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.487
Man, you just saw me do it, right?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.723
And you have to be ready to face
any obstacle that's put in your path.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.570
Yeah, well, don't worry, Barry.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.200
I'm gonna get faster.
Pretty soon, I'm gonna be faster than you.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.001
Oh, yeah? Well, until then,
what's my name?

04:18.360 --> 04:19.850
Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.923
- That's the body?
-Yeah, why?

04:22.079 --> 04:24.003
'Cause he died less than eight hours ago.

04:24.920 --> 04:25.921
Eight hours?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.208
He was a chef here, Stuart Holzman,

04:28.360 --> 04:30.522
and the owner confirmed
that he was working last night.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.488
That's a lot of damage
in a short amount of time.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.002
- We thinking he's a meta?
-Possibly.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.367
Although certain chemicals
can cause a similar reaction.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.409
Yeah, any acid with a pH below two.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.561
Precisely.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.727
We could be looking for an aggressive
variant of a necrotizing fasciitis.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.480
A flesh-eating disease.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.088
In a restaurant?
I'm never eating out again.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.803
Hey, so an autopsy might help us
hone in on what really did this.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.961
Yes, I agree.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.409
Unfortunately, County denied my request

04:57.560 --> 05:00.450
for a 3D-image medical scanner, which
would make short work of the process.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.443
Okay, well, we have one at S.T.A.R. Labs.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.363
Allen, this is an active investigation.
There is protocol to follow.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.441
Surely?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.886
Not if we're gonna figure this out.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.568
Okay. I'll bag the body myself
and meet you there.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.767
Great.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.446

You Okay?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.851
Yeah, I'm just running up
against a deadline, so...

05:28.240 --> 05:30.447
Since I have you both, I wanted to ask,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.606
um, Cecile's daughter, Joanie, is in town,

05:33.760 --> 05:35.922
and I was thinking
that maybe we could all get together,

05:36.080 --> 05:37.366
if you don't think it's too soon.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.166
I mean, I haven't exactly been dating
Cecile for that long--

05:40.360 --> 05:41.521
It's not too early, Joe.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.681
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.605
And Jitters,
is that cool, or is that too casual?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.888
Dad, don't worry, okay? It's great.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.201
Joanie's gonna love you.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.570
I love my kids. I'm gonna set it up.
Thank you.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.767
All right.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.810
<i>BARRY". It's nice to see him so happy.</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:57.408
- Yeah, it is.
-Are you okay?

05:58.360 --> 06:01.204
Hey, I need to show you something
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.441
Okay.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.601
Look.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.371
That's the name
of the restaurant where we just were.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.124
- Yeah.
-I spoke to the owner,

06:10.280 --> 06:11.281
and he said he doesn't think

06:11.440 --> 06:13.363
that the restaurant can survive
an attack like this,

06:13.560 --> 06:16.689
that they'd most likely have
to reopen under a new name.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.127
- It's all coming true, Barry.
-No.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.250
I thought things were changing.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.488
Things are changing, okay? They are.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.167
I was supposed to stop Plunder, right?
And instead Wally did.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.081
And we're gonna stop Savitar, too.
I'm making sure of it.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.521
What if we can't stop all of this?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.050
I'm scared, Barry.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.041
Okay, look.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.841
(SIGHS)

06:41.200 --> 06:43.487
Maybe we should tell Joe.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.242
No, no. No, we agreed that we wouldn't.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.487
Besides, you saw him earlier.
He's planning for a future with Cecile.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.331
If we tell him about Savitar,
it's all he's gonna think about.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.891
I can't do that to him. I won't.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.168
Okay, whatever you want.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.726
But listen to me.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.850
I promise you,
I'm doing everything in my power

07:04.000 --> 07:05.923
to make sure that
that future never happens.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.681
Okay.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.324
CISCO: You think this is what it's like
to be a character on CSI?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.689
What do they hope to gain
from that examination?

07:15.960 --> 07:17.530
BARRY: They're trying to find
the exact cause of death.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.121
Once we know that, we'll have
a better idea of what we're dealing with,

07:20.360 --> 07:21.850
but until then, we need to train.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.601
I'm gonna teach you everything I know,
starting with phasing.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.041
Yes! Finally.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.043
You know what we should do?
We should concoct some simulations

07:28.200 --> 07:30.885
to help Wallace learn this new skill.
What do you say, Francisco?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.883
I've got one word for you, "Quebracho. <i>"</i>

07:33.680 --> 07:34.727
- Let's <i>go.
- Quebracho!</i>

07:37.040 --> 07:38.166
CAITLIN: What's his name?

07:38.320 --> 07:39.731
Doesn't really matter much now, does it?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.325
Of course, we should call him by his name.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.602
After everything he's been through,
he deserves that much respect.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.091
"He" is a corpse,

07:45.240 --> 07:47.527
thus impervious to such bedside manners.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.604
Well, thank goodness 'cause I'd hate
to have to subject him to yours.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.161
Victim is male, between 30 and 40,

07:53.320 --> 07:55.129

and a chest wall retraction--

Julian, look.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.567
The decay continues
even after the tissue's dead.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.404
This is not a bacteria.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.801
Or any other disease
known to medical science.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.484
That was one crazy set, man,
and I'm telling you, Rob,

08:19.680 --> 08:21.250
you keep wailing on that saxophone,

08:21.400 --> 08:24.449
you're gonna be running up

<i>Man, that was some set.</i>

08:48.880 --> 08:51.645

09:39.000 --> 09:41.924
Like you ran into a giant wooden wall?
'Cause you did.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.085
That was not just any big wooden wall.
That's double-reinforced quebracho.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.049
That's like the strongest stuff
on the planet right there.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.850
Well, fantastic choice, Cisco.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.241
Well, it shouldn't matter
if it's wood or steel or stone.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.602
If you're moving fast enough,
you can phase through anything.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.446
Even molten lava? You know,
if you ever ended up in a volcano?

09:58.600 --> 10:01.683

What we don't know
is who he's going after.

But if we find out who they are,
then we can be ready for him.

- We vibe Flashpoint.

We're about to find out.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.846
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

<i>KID FLASH: Barry? Barry?</i>

34:18.320 --> 34:21.164
We're good, man.
Took a lot out of me, but it worked.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.447
Yeah, maybe,
but we've got another problem.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.321
Yorkin's back.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.489
<i>CLIVE: You know what they say, Kid Flash.</i>

34:30.520 --> 34:33.728
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.206
THE FLASH: (OVER COMMS)
You have to <i>stop him.</i>

34:35.880 --> 34:37.245
I don't have it in me right now.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.804
I need you to get your blood into him.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.643
It'll counteract his cells
and negate his powers.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.723
How am I supposed to do that
when I can't even touch him?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.405
You're gonna phase it into him.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.931
<i>You know I've never done that before.</i>

34:47.080 --> 34:48.922
And you just watched me
do something I'd never done,

34:49.080 --> 34:50.411
but I did it because I had to.

34:50.840 --> 34:51.841
<i>All right?</i>

35:01.440 --> 35:02.601
I know you can do it, okay?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.091
<i>I need you to believe it, too.</i>

35:07.480 --> 35:09.528
Now, run, Wally. Run.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.408
It worked. I did it.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.010
You sure did. Goodbye, Kid Flash.

35:31.440 --> 35:36.571
Oh, look at that!
Your powers are neutralized, Yorkin.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.884
- What did you do?
-I won.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.767
Hey, Iris.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.721
Hmm...

35:53.520 --> 35:54.521
(BARRY CHUCKLES)

35:55.040 --> 35:56.041
Dad.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.362
The last time I was this happy looking
into your eyes, you'd just been born.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.401
Hey-

36:04.240 --> 36:07.084
It's okay. You're okay. Yorkin's done.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.646
What happened?

36:09.800 --> 36:12.280
I'll tell you what happened.
Wallace was a total badass.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.130
That's what happened! Translate.

36:14.280 --> 36:18.171
Yeah, he phased his speedster blood
into Yorkin and neutralized his powers.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.521
That's the science behind it.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.601
I had a great teacher.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.081
And me?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.724
Once Yorkin's blood was stabilized,

36:26.880 --> 36:29.451
we actually managed
to get an antidote that cured you.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.125
You'll have to wear
the bandage for a few days,

36:31.280 --> 36:33.647
but, other than that,
you're absolutely recovered.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.561
Thank you. I know what you risked for me.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.845
I had some help.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.561
Couldn't have done it alone.
it was all of us working together.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.127
Yeah. Really proud of everybody.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.282
Great job. Big ideas today.

36:47.680 --> 36:51.287
My point is,
if we're gonna save Iris from Savitar,

36:52.080 --> 36:53.923
we're gonna have to up our game.
No more lies,

36:54.480 --> 36:55.970
even well-intentioned ones.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.441
We have to be completely real
with each other.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.328
- I agree.
-I agree with Joe, too.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.204
From here on out, complete honesty.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.651
<i>Honesty.
-Namaste.</i>

37:08.200 --> 37:11.090
All right, get some rest, all right?
Check on you in a bit.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.405
- JOE: Barr.
-Yeah?

37:16.640 --> 37:20.486
Savitar's prophecy of someone dying,
was that Iris?

37:22.480 --> 37:24.642
Yeah, but it's not gonna happen.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.522
Look, I'm glad
she comes first in your life now.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.889
If you're gonna date my daughter,
that's the way it should be.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.291
You're still a close second.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.481
(LAUGHS)

37:36.600 --> 37:39.046
It's just heartwarming.
It's just truly heartwarming.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.887
You're already crafting a version
of this for your book, aren't you?

37:42.040 --> 37:44.122
"And peace finally descends
upon the Family West."

37:44.320 --> 37:45.890
"The West Family"? "Family West."

37:46.280 --> 37:47.805
Right, it's time I get to work.

37:47.960 --> 37:48.961
At this hour?

37:49.160 --> 37:50.321
Yes, there's still
one husk meta out there,

37:50.480 --> 37:52.847
and I intend to find him. Good night.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.521
CAITLIN: <i>Hey,</i> Julian.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.201
Hey-

38:06.800 --> 38:10.407
I don't think you're weak because
of what happened to you with Savitar.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.361
The strength
that I found to stay in control,

38:13.560 --> 38:14.925
that came from you,

38:15.640 --> 38:16.641
so thank you.

38:16.840 --> 38:17.841
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:19.560 --> 38:22.803
Well, I wasn't gonna let Iris die
at the hands of Killer Frost, was I?

38:23.320 --> 38:25.402
I knew there was a good guy
inside of you somewhere,

38:25.880 --> 38:28.406
one that the rest of us
would like to see a lot more often.

38:31.880 --> 38:32.927
Good night.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.325
Do you wanna get a drink?

38:38.560 --> 38:39.686
Uh...

38:39.920 --> 38:41.968
- What, as in now?
-Yeah.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.403
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'd love that.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.971
- Hey.
- JOE: <i>Hey!</i>

38:54.400 --> 38:56.084
What brings you to my neck of the bullpen?

38:56.520 --> 38:58.249
Oh, Joanie's headed back for midterms.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.204
We just thought we'd come and say goodbye.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.401
Aw.

39:03.480 --> 39:08.042
I was hoping a redo on the coffee,
seeing as the last one went off the rails.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.651
- Yeah.
-Are you kidding me?

39:09.800 --> 39:12.167
I got to see Kid Flash
in action right up close.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.402
Well, we got a lot
of stories about Kid Flash

39:14.560 --> 39:15.846
I can guarantee you never heard.

39:16.040 --> 39:19.169
Maybe we can tell you them
over dinner next time you come to town?

39:19.320 --> 39:21.288
I have a long weekend next month.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.569
You sure you're ready to commit
to something that far in the future?

39:26.120 --> 39:28.805
I am absolutely sure.

39:28.960 --> 39:29.961
Hmm?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.407
Good.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.721
We should go.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.209
- Good luck in school.
-Thank you. See you.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.165
- Bye,babe.
-Bye.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.281
Okay.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.002
Good as new.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.640
Actually, it's better than new
with the three extra locks that I added.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.563
Which you didn't have to do.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.690
Well, Cisco did offer
to build us a custom security door,

39:54.840 --> 39:58.686
but we've both seen how well those things
keep people out of S.T.A.R. Labs, so...

39:58.840 --> 40:01.002
I like deadbolts. Deadbolts work.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.405
Just with what happened here,
I wanna make sure you feel safe.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.481
I do.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.606
About everything?

40:12.840 --> 40:13.887
You know, you've been saying for weeks

40:14.040 --> 40:15.690
-that you were gonna save me from Savitar.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:16.640 --> 40:21.680
And while I trust you with my life,
it was hard not to feel scared.

40:24.760 --> 40:29.288
You know, sometimes it feels like
the Flash is this guy my boyfriend becomes

40:29.440 --> 40:31.124
when he runs off to save other people.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.888
Like, I'm the only one
who doesn't get the Flash.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.571
He felt separate from you.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.245
But yesterday, when you saved me,

40:40.400 --> 40:42.846
I remembered
that I have no reason to be scared.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.526
- Mmm-mmm
-The man I love is a superhero.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.931
I love and trust you,
Barry Allen, the Flash.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.241
I love all of you, and I always will.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.731
I love you.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.644
- That was so nice.
-(CHUCKLES)

41:12.600 --> 41:14.011

41:26.720 --> 41:27.721
(CHUCKLES)

41:34.800 --> 41:36.529
- Jesse!
-No,no,no.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.881
What's wrong?

41:38.040 --> 41:42.682
Grodd, he's got my dad.
He has him in Gorilla City.
