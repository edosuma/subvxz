00:26.040 --> 00:28.120
You know those popular summer hits?

00:28.200 --> 00:31.280
You hear them once, and bam.
It's over.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.760
They stick to you for months,
for years.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.880
There's no washing yourself
of earworms.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.480
They'll keep ringing in your head,
without mercy...

00:39.640 --> 00:43.920
That winter of 2016,
I had a very personal one.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.480
It went like this:

00:46.560 --> 00:48.120
# He's gonna make you quit #

00:48.880 --> 00:51.080
# He's gonna make you quit, I swear #

00:51.400 --> 00:52.760
# He's gonna make you quit #

00:54.120 --> 00:57.760
# He's gonna make you quit, you'll see.
He's gonna make you quit #

00:58.960 --> 01:02.640
# He's gonna make you quit,
I'm telling you... #

01:02.720 --> 01:04.640
I was there as a ball boy.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.880
While I was watching the game

01:08.320 --> 01:11.480
Totti came to me
while doing warm-ups

01:11.560 --> 01:13.680
and asked if I wanted
to kick the ball around a bit

01:13.760 --> 01:15.760
and I said yes,
so we did.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.760
Thanks for having played with me,
Francesco. See you next time.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.040
Roma is winning 2 to 0
on Sassuolo's home field

01:22.120 --> 01:26.000
but Francesco Totti's attitude
is getting more attention.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.600
The smirking,
sarcastic captain

01:27.680 --> 01:31.040
is being accused of lacking interest
in his teammates.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.480
He kicked off things
by playing with that boy.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.040
A humble ball boy kicking it
with Francesco Totti.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.280
He's got some tales
to tell at school tomorrow.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.240
I wonder if he even realized.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.440
There he goes.
Not half bad, either.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.200
And then he capped it off
with this middle school prank.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.520
We've all done it as kids.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.640
He pulls this prank on Pjanić,
who looks up...

01:52.720 --> 01:54.800
He looks up to try
and fool him, fantastic.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.200
What else could I do? An hour of warm-ups,
and he wouldn't let me play.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.600
Not a single minute!
Screw him!

01:59.680 --> 02:01.560
Do these things
help morale?

02:01.640 --> 02:04.040
Focus is everything
in our line of work.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.400
I've never liked a player
who sits there like he's on a school trip

02:08.480 --> 02:12.480
clowning around... He's more
an actor than a sportsman, now.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.000
He's painting me as an asshole.
The perfect crime.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.400
You need more evidence?

02:16.480 --> 02:18.560
You want to be right?
You're right. What can I say?

02:18.640 --> 02:20.160
-I'd rather be wrong.
-So would I.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
There you go.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.440
Still, simmer down,
come on.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.640
He'll make me throw up.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.840
I don't feel like a player,
I feel like yesterday's garbage.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.680
-Then quit.
-Who are you talking to?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.400
Quit for what, for him?
This guy comes in and I quit?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.560
Francesco,
he won't stop at low blows.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.560
One piece at a time,
he'll destroy you.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.920
Hey, I'm still the captain.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.600
-I deserve some fucking respect!
-Of course you do.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.800
I'm not part of your plans?
You don't need me? Tell me to my face.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.560
Show some guts
and tell me to my face.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.000
Don't stiff me every time.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.920
Francesco, calm down.
What can you do?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.160
He's just waiting for you
to do something stupid.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.160
Put yourself in my shoes,
like a dog abandoned in the cold.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.640
Like an idiot.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.480
If he thinks I'll be a statue
in Modena against Carpi

03:03.560 --> 03:04.760
he understands jack shit.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.160
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

03:12.440 --> 03:16.240
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

03:16.480 --> 03:19.760
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

03:19.840 --> 03:23.880
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

03:24.320 --> 03:27.480
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

03:27.640 --> 03:31.040
-Number 16. Daniele...
-De Rossi!

03:31.120 --> 03:34.680
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

03:35.240 --> 03:38.320
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

03:38.800 --> 03:42.520
-Number 92, Stephan...
- El Shaarawy!

03:42.600 --> 03:46.280
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

03:46.960 --> 03:50.600
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko!

03:51.560 --> 03:52.880
On the sidelines...

03:53.800 --> 03:57.840
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

03:57.920 --> 03:59.840
and now, a legend.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.440
Thank you, Captain.
Number 10, Francesco...

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

04:05.600 --> 04:06.960
Totti!

04:20.480 --> 04:22.600
Why are you here? You were supposed
to leave with the team.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.840
I was...

04:24.000 --> 04:25.200
Then what?

04:26.080 --> 04:29.840
I told him I'm sick
and won't go.

04:30.080 --> 04:30.960
Really?

04:32.160 --> 04:33.960
Yeah, I did tell him.
But I'm not sick.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.840
You're making up bullshit now?

04:40.200 --> 04:44.440
"Bullshit." He says I'm an actor?
I'll take him up on that.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.960
"He's an actor," he says.
I'll show him acting.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.560
So you're
the imaginary invalid now?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.200
Yeah. I'm playing the part so well
I'm even feeling pain.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.360
-If you say so.
-I do say so.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.840
Why aren't you on the bench
against Carpi?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.960
I hurt myself. If you're hurt,
you don't sit on the bench.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.640
You seem more angry
than injured to me.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.600
A little.
I'm half injured, half angry.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.720
But that doesn't concern you.
Don't even think about it.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.360
Why's that?

05:13.440 --> 05:14.480
What do you mean, "why?"

05:14.560 --> 05:17.200
Because you're young,
and still have to build your career.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.320
And to that end,
you must respect the rules.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.480
You can't just...
It's different for me.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.280
I need to  save  my career,
and certain rules are hard to accept.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.880
You may have
the best story ever

05:29.960 --> 05:32.040
but if the ending's trash,
you throw it all away.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.120
Once you get to be my age,
we'll talk it over.

05:42.800 --> 05:43.720
Hey!

05:43.800 --> 05:45.040
Listen, they called...

05:46.280 --> 05:49.520
They asked if you feel like
being interviewed by TG1.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
Don't know if you do.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.280
Next week, on Saturday.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.120
It's for the 10-year celebration
of the 2006 World Cup...

05:57.720 --> 05:58.760
Yeah, I'll do it.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.880
I wanted to get
a few things off my chest.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.240
Francesco, they're ready.
They're waiting for you.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.640
I'm coming.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.960
What I didn't know

06:28.240 --> 06:32.000
was that at the same time,
Spalletti was talking about me.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.920
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.120
Francesco, like we said.

06:38.000 --> 06:38.920
Sure thing.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.160
Coach, one question about Totti...

06:42.760 --> 06:45.800
Totti, Totti...
Always, always Totti.

06:45.880 --> 06:51.800
How can I drive the point home?
I train a whole team, not just Totti.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.920
-Francesco, how's your mood today?
-Ups and downs. I'm a bit disappointed.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.720
Were you expecting another treatment
from the Roma team?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.880
I certainly did.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.000
It's bad not just for myself...

07:07.600 --> 07:08.920
but for everyone around me.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
I always strive
to take into consideration

07:15.600 --> 07:18.120
everyone and everything.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
For the well-being of the Roma team.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.960
Let's say
I was expecting more respect

07:24.600 --> 07:28.680
for what I've given the club
over the years.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.920
I've always put the team
above all else.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.960
It's sad,
ending a career this way.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.240
My respect for Totti
as a player

07:37.320 --> 07:39.960
is so profound...

07:40.400 --> 07:44.520
My relationship with the coach?
"Good morning" and "Goodnight".

07:44.600 --> 07:47.480
...that I treat him
like I would any other.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.960
I certainly respect him
as a coach.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.560
And as a man.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.000
But obviously...

07:55.880 --> 08:00.120
some of the things
I've read in the papers

08:00.480 --> 08:03.000
I'd rather he had said
to my face.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.240
That's all.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.520
I must say that in this last period
he has trained well,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.040
he did all
that was asked of him.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.080
In this context,
there is a chance

08:15.160 --> 08:18.040
that he will play first-string
tomorrow, against Palermo.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.800
How could I imagine

08:21.880 --> 08:24.920
that as I was finally
giving him a piece of my mind

08:25.000 --> 08:26.680
he'd be announcing
my return to the field?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.400
Naturally, my words
sounded like a declaration of war.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.480
It was the Devil's doing.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.280
What the fuck are you doing?
You fucking idiot!

08:40.760 --> 08:45.720
Tell me what I should do with you.
Go on, tell me. Tell me.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.360
I just criticized the club.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.440
On a technical level,
I only spoke well of you.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.080
I don't give a crap!

08:51.160 --> 08:54.280
What matters
is what the papers write.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.320
You know better than I do
how the press works.

08:56.400 --> 09:01.000
Right. Shouldn't you think
before you talk, then?

09:01.080 --> 09:06.280
Think before saying what you said,
before making this mess.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.680
I didn't mean to offend anyone.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.880
And if my words offend someone,
it's not my problem.

09:13.040 --> 09:18.000
Right. You never understand.
You don't  want  to understand!

09:21.440 --> 09:22.320
Anyway...

09:24.120 --> 09:25.600
You won't be called
to play today.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.160
So, now that you don't need me,
you bust my balls?

09:32.240 --> 09:35.080
Huh? When you needed me,
you acted like a puppy.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.200
He acted like a puppy
when he needed me.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.960
-Do you realize that time is over?
-Oh, give it a rest.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.960
Will you get it through your head
that you're no longer irreplaceable?

09:45.040 --> 09:48.040
Are you out for blood, man?
Did you come back just for revenge?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.880
Then say so.
Show some balls and say so.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.240
Listen, Francesco. Why don't you go home?
That'll be best for everyone.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.440
You're kicking me out now?

09:54.520 --> 09:58.040
I'm not kicking you out. I'm just saying
that you won't be called to play.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.920
-I won't be called?
-The rest is up to you.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.400
Sure, let's go to war.
We'll see whose side Rome's on.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.680
We'll see whose side Rome's on.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.040
It may have sounded
like bluster, a bully's line.

10:06.120 --> 10:10.960
I'm sorry, folks...
But I'm me, and you're all jack shit.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.600
Maybe I went too far.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.160
But it came from my heart.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.800
I could've kept quiet,
but I'm still someone in this city.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.040
More important even
than the Marquis.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.960
I was crowned eighth king of Rome.
I earned that title on the field.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.160
-Francesco Totti!
-What a great goal!

10:45.240 --> 10:46.640
Fantastic goal
by Francesco Totti!

10:46.720 --> 10:47.960
Francesco!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.160
An extraordinary goal!

10:53.960 --> 10:55.680
It's him again!

10:55.760 --> 10:58.040
Truly exceptional!

11:00.160 --> 11:03.120
For 20 years, I've had a faithful army
following me everywhere.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
It's a bit much.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.760
Where I used to live,
in a low-income neighbourhood,

11:10.160 --> 11:13.280
where we had always lived...
it just couldn't keep up like that.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.600
Fiorella.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.160
I speak on behalf
of the whole building.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.520
You know we love you, right?

11:25.680 --> 11:26.600
I do.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.440
Francesco is like a son to us.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.760
We saw him grow up,
become a champion.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.120
Of course.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.080
Right. But...?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.680
But...

11:40.640 --> 11:43.640
the situation has
become unbearable, Fiorella.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.120
It's no longer an apartment building.
It's a court of miracles!

11:48.040 --> 11:52.320
-They took everything. Let's go.
-Hey, wait a second.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.640
It smells like Totti!

11:55.320 --> 11:58.120
Hey, I'm sick of you freaks
stealing our mats!

11:59.360 --> 12:02.560
I should cut your hands off!
Bunch of...

12:02.640 --> 12:04.280
Three in one week.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.880
We'll end up spending more
for door mats than for heating.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.400
-Yes.
-It's not that big a deal!

12:09.480 --> 12:12.280
FRANCESCO THE ONE AND ONLY

12:19.200 --> 12:21.000
Francesco, forgive me.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.720
I swear I'm not
a Lazio fan.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.360
Not even during Roma-Liverpool
did I cry like this.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.280
And then there is the most...

12:32.680 --> 12:33.800
embarrassing incident.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.240
Which is?

12:55.080 --> 12:58.000
-Who are you?
-Please, ma'am. Do you know Totti?

13:06.720 --> 13:10.440
Fiorella, every day,
from dawn to dusk.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.880
We can't go on like this.
You see?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.400
I see. I do.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
So, we have to leave?

13:19.640 --> 13:21.320
They're not forcing us.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.040
But...

13:24.400 --> 13:25.360
I understand them.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.960
-We've been here a lifetime.
-Precisely.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.120
Think how long
we've been busting their balls.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.280
Good thing they didn't remove
the tiles from our bathroom.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.440
I would've.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.000
Let's talk.
Maybe there's another way.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.040
Any ideas?

13:41.560 --> 13:42.440
I'll leave.

13:43.880 --> 13:47.480
What are you saying?
Are you crazy? What will you do?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.720
I'll find a place.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.920
-I mean, he's 24.
-What's that got to do with it?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.760
Right. Since it came from me,
it's not a valid point.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.040
-24 isn't a lot.
-Sure. It's less than 25.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.760
Such is the life of a king.
Crowns have thorns.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.200
And we must make
the heavy choices.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.960
In short,
I am the only king

14:10.040 --> 14:13.240
forced into exile
because he was too loved.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.280
Vincent Candela lives here.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.160
Zago, there. A little farther down,
Marco Delvecchio.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.880
-Where's Candela again?
-This house here.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.000
This is a sort of happy island.
Absolute peace.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.920
From Rome's heart,
Porta Metronia

14:28.360 --> 14:31.120
to Axa, the California
of soccer players.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.600
Seems nice, huh?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.080
Is there any café,
a newspaper stand?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.240
-There's one nearby.
-Where?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.200
About a mile that way.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.600
So much for being nearby.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.360
FRANCESCO TOTTI SQUARE
8TH KING OF ROME

14:59.720 --> 15:01.000
You like the wolf, Ma?

15:01.840 --> 15:03.400
-Cool, huh?
-Yes.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.480
What's the matter?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.280
I don't know. Couldn't sleep.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.160
You hear that silence?

15:13.960 --> 15:14.920
There's crickets, Ma.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.040
Those aren't crickets,
they're cicadas.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.680
I'm not used to this.
It scares me.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.280
That's normal. It'll take time, Mom.
You'll get used to it.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.320
I don't know.
It all feels so weird.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.320
There's only three of us.
Isn't this too much?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.840
Mom, we're not stealing.
We earned this.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.200
You earned it.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.520
-No, come on.
-You did.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.600
You think I'd be where I am
without you, Ma?

15:42.840 --> 15:45.640
-Enjoy it.
-It's not easy.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.320
When you think there's people without
even a roof over their heads.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.120
What will we do
with all these rooms?

15:52.200 --> 15:55.920
In one we'll put your knick-knacks.
Another, soccer balls.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.800
I knew everyone there.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.960
There's nobody here.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.200
Maybe some Brazilian guy
in flip-flops over there.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.040
-That's where the Brazilians are.
-Where?

16:06.440 --> 16:08.240
-There.
-What can I say to them?  Aloha.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.880
Brazilians are very pleasant people.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.360
You'll make good friends
with the Brazilians, Mom.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.720
They always
take their siblings with them.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.840
They're cool.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.520
You know Emerson?
That dark-skinned player.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.960
-Sure.
-Wonderful guy.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.200
I know it's hard for you.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.680
But I'm hounded.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.000
Hounded.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.600
That's my life.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.240
The night we won
the Italian championship.

16:38.320 --> 16:43.600
Among the happiest in my life.
I lived through it like an astronaut.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.640
I couldn't show my face.

17:07.280 --> 17:11.440
In Rome, when you win a championship,
there's no being safe.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.280
No matter how,
everyone always knows everything.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.080
Like in a James Bond movie...

17:26.760 --> 17:28.160
The coast is clear, France'!

17:28.920 --> 17:30.520
-What is it?
-You're insane.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.400
-What did I do?
-Who taught you how to drive?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.600
-Well?
-Is that how you turn corners?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.680
Should I go straight?
Rome has lots of corners.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.160
-You should go slower.
-I did.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.400
-I banged my head four times.
-You're not hurt.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.880
-I feel like throwing up.
-Let's go.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.480
-Take it easier next time.
-Come on, with me. This way.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.880
-Where the hell are we?
-It's not an ambush. Come with me.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.440
They'll get angry.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.640
Get angry? It's all organized.
I talked to them today. Don't worry.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.480
Shit, man.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.080
-Hey! Look where we are!
-I told you. This way.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.520
-I can't believe it.
-What else are friends for?

18:06.600 --> 18:07.760
Here we go...

18:07.840 --> 18:10.800
-No way.
-Yes way. We're going, though.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.000
The Captain himself...
so awesome!

18:13.440 --> 18:16.320
-The eggplant's burning.
-What brings you to our kitchen?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.240
Ask him, not me.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.640
-See who I've brought along?
-Great, Vito. Great.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.120
-What can I make for you, France'?
-Whatever you like.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.800
-Something fresh?
-How are you, Riccardo?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.160
-Just something quick.
-Come on.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.920
Someone put a spell on you?
Hurry with that eggplant.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.160
I can't be seen around.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.720
France', do me a favor.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.640
Go out and say hello,
they'll calm down.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.360
-Go out? Who, me?
-Who else? Me?

18:39.560 --> 18:43.160
Here, France'. This way.
See what you can do.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.600
-What  can  I do?
-Just show your face.

18:48.840 --> 18:52.680
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.800
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.120
You should see the crowd.
What should I do?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.320
Say hello.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.280
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.560
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.360
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.400
They're getting in.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.640
-Really?
-Yeah, they're getting in.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.080
They'll wreck the place.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.840
Here, France'. We'd better leave.
Where's an exit?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.120
This way, this way.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.840
-Same place we got in?
-No, they're everywhere.

19:23.920 --> 19:27.920
Listen to me. Go up these stairs.
You'll see an embankment.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.440
Go down, climb over,
and you're off.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.840
-Get down or they'll see you.
-There they are.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.160
-What's an embankment?
-A sort of mound.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.160
-Then say mound.
-Whatever. Where are you going?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.080
There it is, there it is.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.600
I can't get down like this.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.800
-Stop!
-You made it.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.640
-Oh, God.
-You made it.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.040
-You're--
-You'll make me fall.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.840
You made it an hour ago.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.480
The embankment!
It was a gate.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.960
Someone's here. Wait.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.560
Hey, you! Criminals!
Where are you going?

20:03.640 --> 20:05.320
-No, Father, we're not thieves!
-We're not.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.920
-Come forward. Let me see your faces.
-Yes, hello.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.160
Look at that thug's mug.
I'll show you.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.120
He's right.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.320
-You, with the scoundrel face!
-I'm his friend.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.560
-Wait. Are you the Captain?
-Am I? Yeah.

20:15.640 --> 20:19.920
If you wanted to meet Our Lord,
I'd have opened the gate for you.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.840
Sure, Father, but see,
it's just the fans back there--

20:22.920 --> 20:24.720
Oh, so you're not here for Our Lord?

20:25.120 --> 20:28.520
No, but there are
2,000 people out there.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.400
-Whatever shall we do?
-We have to go.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.560
We should do as Moses did

20:32.640 --> 20:36.040
when he split the waters
that swallowed up the pharaohs.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.360
We must create a passage.
Please, this way.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.920
This way? Let's go.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.200
Thank you, Father.
Very kind of you. Thank you so--

20:42.280 --> 20:44.800
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

20:45.640 --> 20:46.480
Here.

20:46.560 --> 20:51.440
-Oh, thanks. Praised be Jesus Christ.
-Praised be. Wait, wait.

20:52.040 --> 20:52.880
What is it?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.840
You need to sign it.
You got a pen?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.560
-Do you have a pen?
-No, I don't.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.960
-You don't have a pen?
-No.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.520
Then we'll go to the sacristy, find a pen
and get me my autograph.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.440
Shall we?

21:02.520 --> 21:05.280
-Are you for real?
-When will I get another chance?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.080
-"To Father Fulgenzio."
-Yes.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.160
"With love and admiration."

21:09.680 --> 21:11.400
-That, too?
-That, too.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.800
In sum, I am Rome's king...
and prisoner.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.680
And with my reign
being threatened

21:20.120 --> 21:25.680
I needed my army to be heard,
chase out the invader.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.040
Sure, let's go to war.
We'll see whose side Rome's on.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.560
Winds of war today in Trigoria

21:32.640 --> 21:35.840
with harsh words exchanged
between Totti and Spalletti.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.520
It looks like the Captain
will not play against Palermo.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.160
It doesn't "look" like anything.
I'm not playing!

21:44.120 --> 21:45.200
Hi.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.720
-What happened?
-He kicked me out, after 24 years.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.400
He kicked me out of Trigoria.
That guy kicked me out of my home.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.480
Wait, let me
get this straight.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.280
It bites his ass
that I said the truth.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.160
For once, instead of faking
like everyone else does

22:01.240 --> 22:02.800
I said the actual truth
to a newspaper.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.720
-He can't humiliate you like this.
-Well, he did. All right?

22:07.600 --> 22:10.680
Well, you must do something.
React. You can't just take it.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.840
What should I do?
Run him over with my car?

22:17.880 --> 22:18.920
It's your mother.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.160
-Fiorella?
-Is Francesco there?

22:25.240 --> 22:26.520
...was wrong and Francesco...

22:26.600 --> 22:27.480
Let me talk to him!

22:27.560 --> 22:29.760
The Captain is untouchable.
Totti is Totti.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.480
-He can't talk now. You can tell me.
-The radio!

22:32.560 --> 22:35.880
Have you heard the radio?
All hell has broken loose.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.240
Radio in Rome
is not just an invention by Marconi.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.680
It's something else.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.720
A sort of courtroom,
a public venting place,

22:43.800 --> 22:47.120
a soccer fan's confessional,
open 24 hours a day.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.880
There are seven stations just for talking
about the Roma team.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.720
For players and coaches
it's a type of torture.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.160
It's the end of days.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.400
An Armageddon.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.640
The Captain was asked
to leave Trigoria.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.480
Have you gone mad?
Are you high? You Lazio fan!

23:05.560 --> 23:09.000
You're a Lazio fan. Only a Lazio fan
would say something like that.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.600
Now, all of you
behind a steering wheel

23:12.680 --> 23:18.320
at the café, at home,
I don't care if you're in a basement...

23:19.040 --> 23:20.520
Go get your son, right now

23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
look him straight in the eyes
and slap him, real hard.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.480
"Be quiet. Don't you cry."

23:26.760 --> 23:28.760
"This is a day to remember, my boy."

23:28.840 --> 23:29.920
"Because today..."

23:31.120 --> 23:33.200
"...is Roma's 9/11."

23:33.840 --> 23:36.880
I don't know. The size
of this thing is... I don't know.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.320
Nazi troops entering Paris.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.560
Or when Cicciolina
first sat in the Parliament.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.920
It's Monarchy vs. Republic.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.120
We can't shit our pants.
We must decide whose side we're on.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.520
Totti or Spalletti!

23:49.960 --> 23:54.360
In 24 years, those radio shows
had showed nothing but love to me

23:54.680 --> 23:57.600
but time, that jerk,
wears everything out.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.600
Muscles, legs. Even your heart.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
He's crossed the line.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.840
He's 39. He can't expect
to do and say whatever he pleases.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.840
I'm with Spalletti.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.560
Then shut up!

24:06.880 --> 24:07.920
Who are you talking to?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.720
A coach is right to want respect,
but Spalletti's done it now.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.560
Again with Spalletti?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.840
How many Spallettis are there?
There's only one Totti.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.960
Are you hearing this?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.920
You've been glued to that thing
for hours.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.280
And even now, you won't say anything.
Mute as ever!

24:21.360 --> 24:23.480
Isn't this concert enough?

24:25.200 --> 24:27.240
...but this time he's wrong

24:27.320 --> 24:29.280
and Francesco,
as a captain, knows it.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.400
Totti is a momma's boy.
He's always been a softy.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.720
He's good for eating spaghetti
at the Sunday table.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.160
He's not worth shit now.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.280
Just look at what I'll do to him!

25:08.480 --> 25:12.040
You're not supposed to tell him
your life story every time!

25:13.080 --> 25:14.120
Father Luca?

25:14.360 --> 25:16.640
It's been a tough day,
Father Luca.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.240
All the terrible things
they said about Francesco.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.920
First they praise him

25:22.000 --> 25:26.280
then at the first sign of hardship,
bam, Ides of March.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.640
-They stab him, those assho--
-No, Fiorella. It's a church. Come on.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.640
-You're right, but it's the truth.
-All right. Forget it.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.840
I tried to resist.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.800
But then...

25:42.520 --> 25:43.600
Then...?

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
I sinned.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.880
We have Graziella on the line.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.520
- Hello?
-Hi, Graziella.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.520
What's on your mind?

25:50.600 --> 25:56.040
I want to say that you're a bunch
of ungrateful sons of bitches!

25:57.840 --> 25:59.080
Is that what you said?

26:00.160 --> 26:01.240
I wanted to.

26:01.800 --> 26:07.000
I wanted to tell you that the Captain
is like a son to me.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.720
But of course.
We feel the same way.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.240
- Don't cry, ma'am.
-I'm not.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.760
Well done.
You showed restraint.

26:17.960 --> 26:22.520
With them. But off the phone,
I buried them in insults.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.320
Them, their families,
their children's children

26:25.400 --> 26:27.960
their future generations,
all their ancestors.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.440
-Their dead?
-Yeah.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.680
-Anything else?
-No.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.920
Look, Fiorella.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.360
Betrayal is a feeling

26:35.440 --> 26:38.480
the Christian community
knows very well.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.480
You know, the people
picked Barabbas over Christ.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.160
And people learn nothing
from history.

26:45.880 --> 26:49.800
But people are one thing,
and Christians are another.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.880
And a good Christian forgives.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.880
Always forgives.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.120
All right?

26:58.640 --> 27:01.880
Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis
in nomine Patris, et Filiis

27:01.960 --> 27:03.600
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.920
Thank you.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.560
Oh, Fiorella.

27:09.440 --> 27:14.760
Just one thing,
on a strictly personal note.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.480
That Baldy's a serious piece of--

27:21.680 --> 27:24.640
-Father Luca!
-I know, but it's the truth!

27:25.640 --> 27:27.760
Tensions run high
here at the Olimpico stadium

27:27.840 --> 27:31.720
where the duel between Totti
and Spalletti still rages.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.440
The Captain hasn't even
been called to the field.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.080
The fans seem
confused, disoriented

27:38.240 --> 27:39.920
by this arm wrestling match.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.680
Let's see what they think.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.280
I've always been on Totti's side,
but I don't know...

27:45.360 --> 27:50.440
I think Spalletti's just trying
to protect the club...

27:50.520 --> 27:51.680
FEBRUARY 21st, 2016

27:51.760 --> 27:53.960
They should have kept
this conflict on a private level.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.200
Totti's almost 40...

27:57.280 --> 28:00.480
This was the state of things
as the match loomed.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.160
The more time went by,
the less sure I was of anything.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.040
What have you decided?

28:08.160 --> 28:09.200
I'm staying.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.320
-You're caving in to him like that?
-What can I do?

28:13.640 --> 28:17.160
Go to the stadium.
Let the people, the team

28:17.240 --> 28:18.720
the fans,
everyone see you.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.680
Only injured and former players
sit in the stands.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.320
And I'm neither, so...

28:23.720 --> 28:26.320
But you will be, and soon,
if you let him win.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.720
People need to know
that your conscience is clear!

28:36.960 --> 28:39.200
-Have you heard the radio?
-A little.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.680
A lot of people are on my side

28:41.760 --> 28:46.720
but many also say,
"Totti's getting old, time flies."

28:48.440 --> 28:49.680
Stuff like that.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.800
Maybe I'm the past, huh?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.720
I just want to catch a plane
and fly far away.

29:06.720 --> 29:10.240
How many times
did I tell you to quit? So many.

29:10.880 --> 29:11.920
But not now.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.040
And especially not like this.

29:15.440 --> 29:19.400
This is something different.
It's a matter of dignity.

29:20.680 --> 29:26.080
No one, Francesco,
can dare treat you like this.

29:26.560 --> 29:31.200
Kick you out, humiliate you,
treat you like you're ruining everything.

29:31.280 --> 29:35.000
It won't stand. You must show everyone
that you are stronger than he is.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.360
You're learning that today?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.240
-I'm not.
-Then what?

29:39.240 --> 29:41.840
There's no alternative.
Let's go to the stadium.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.840
No, no, no.
Don't put your coat on.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.760
We've made enough
of a stir already.

29:49.880 --> 29:54.320
It's bad for the team, too.
Take your coat off! Take it off.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.520
No, you must be selfish now.
Think of yourself. You have to fight.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.520
I'm telling you straight up.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.600
If you don't come to the stadium with me,
because that's where I'm going,

30:02.680 --> 30:03.760
I'll leave you.

30:06.160 --> 30:09.400
-Honey, don't be dramatic.
-I'm not kidding. I'm divorcing you.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.600
Crap, she is.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.320
Cris! Mom's kidding.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.320
You know how many years
I've known her?

30:25.400 --> 30:28.160
Dad, Mom's right.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.760
If I don't go to the stadium,
will you leave me too?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.760
He was wrong
to criticize the club.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.960
It's right that those
in better shape should play.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.920
No, I'm not saying
he should quit

30:54.440 --> 30:58.040
but he can't play 90 minutes
as first-string.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.560
He's 38.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.920
I think Totti
was in the wrong this time.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.080
He shouldn't have made
such a big deal of it on television.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.960
You shouldn't air
your dirty laundry in public.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.800
Totti is an employee.
He must respect his employer.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.400
Saying stuff like that before the game,
even for a captain, is no good.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.800
And guess what?
I named my son Francesco.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.840
But you can't act like that.
It's not right.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.720
I've heard these sounds for 24 years.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.400
They've accompanied me
on the field.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.720
They've helped me
achieve wonders.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.840
But this time, it's not the same.
I'm playing a different game.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.360
And I don't know
that Rome will be on my side.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.800
What if they boo me?

34:16.240 --> 34:19.440
I had gone in as king,
but didn't know how I'd come out.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.080
HANDS OFF TOTTI!

36:00.480 --> 36:04.680
One Captain,
there is only one Captain.

36:47.960 --> 36:48.800
Francesco.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.320
Roma won, and you won.
We can say that?

36:52.440 --> 36:53.960
What matters is that Roma won.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.120
How did it feel
to hear them boo Spalletti?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.920
All that matters
are those three points.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.200
-Nothing else. Bye, folks.
-Bye, Francesco.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.640
ROMA IS TOTTI

37:12.960 --> 37:17.400
I had won.
Rome hadn't turned its back on me.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.480
But there was little cause
for celebration.

37:19.560 --> 37:23.440
When you butt heads,
win or lose, you get hurt.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.960
And that night
a lot of us got hurt.

37:27.040 --> 37:32.040
Myself, Rome,
the team, even Spalletti.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.680
And all for nothing.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.960
Because the next day,
it would all start over.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.040
All for nothing.

37:39.560 --> 37:43.240
My years were still there,
like a vulture.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.920
I was still the king

37:45.440 --> 37:48.480
but my throne
had an expiration date.
