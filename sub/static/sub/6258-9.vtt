00:07.240 --> 00:09.447
( Pablo grunting )

00:09.600 --> 00:11.762
There must be some spell
I can say to undo all this.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.285
Eli:
You have to bury it deep

00:13.440 --> 00:15.090
below the place
yourjourney began.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.971
( Screaming )

00:21.160 --> 00:23.128
- ( grunting )
- ( groaning )

00:23.280 --> 00:25.647
Just keep on breathing, okay?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.962
I've been wanting
to, uh, um...

00:28.120 --> 00:29.610
get closer to you?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.125
- Well, hey there.
- Hello.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.169
Heather:
So, are you two together or--

00:33.320 --> 00:34.970
No.
He's got a girlfriend, though.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.646
<i>'</i> Aah!
<i>'</i> No!

00:37.800 --> 00:39.802
Amanda.
What the hell happened?

00:39.960 --> 00:42.804
Your hand--
it grew another you.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.122
( Roars )

00:45.280 --> 00:46.281
Looking for me?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.482
Both:
Time...

00:48.640 --> 00:50.642
to...

00:50.800 --> 00:52.131
die.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.165
- What the fuck...
- Is going on?

01:21.520 --> 01:25.002
- ( Blows landing )
- ( Ash grunting)

01:26.680 --> 01:27.841
Oh!

01:31.840 --> 01:33.171
Son of a bitch!

01:34.600 --> 01:36.284
( Gunfire continues )

01:42.520 --> 01:43.851
Kelly:
Holy shit.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.530
Two Ashes?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.208
Easy, kids.
No need to jump the gun here.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.761
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't shoot the wrong guy, dummies.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.689
Oh, ho!
You buying this shiny turd?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.530
This is the guy
who killed Fisher.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.045
Come on, take him out.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.201
I did not.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.522
That guy killed Fisher.
Take him down.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.802
Of course he's going to say that.
He's a murderer.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.610
Pablo, amigo,
just kill the guy

02:04.760 --> 02:06.728
and I'll get you a pifiata
or whatever.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.566
- Subtle racism.
- But not that subtle.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.404
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm a racist, too.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.050
Asian babies creep me out.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.725
But unlike Mr. imposter here,

02:15.880 --> 02:17.882
I know stuff about your past.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.405
Stuff that only you told me.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.891
Pablo, until you were nine,

02:21.040 --> 02:23.042
your best friend was a kitty cat.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.446
Notorious C.A.T.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.887
Anybody can figure that crap out.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.411
Kelly, when you were
in junior high school,

02:28.560 --> 02:30.642
you told me you busted
a stained glass window of a church.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.450
By accident.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.728
Then you punched
a nun in the face. Ha ha.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.764
She was being so dramatic
about that stained glass.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.251
And she hit me first.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.004
Okay, look,
just shoot us both.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.241
What?

02:42.400 --> 02:44.084
Yeah, it's the only way.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.321
That way, this asswipe is dead

02:45.480 --> 02:47.926
and I don't have to deal
with this horseshit anymore.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.764
( Chuckles )

02:49.920 --> 02:51.081
Come on.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.528
- All right.
- Oh. Oh, no. No, no.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.250
(grunting )

02:56.440 --> 02:58.886
( music playing )

03:07.760 --> 03:09.922
Okay, how'd you know
it was really me?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.600
Well, first off, you're racist,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.125
but not against Asians.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.281
Well, why would I be?

03:15.440 --> 03:16.965
They give such
incredible massages

03:17.120 --> 03:18.121
with those teeny hands.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.806
Also, you tried to take
the easy way out.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.007
Total Ash move.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.366
What? Come on.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.806
The only person you're willing

03:24.960 --> 03:27.042
to lay down
and die for is you.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.282
Well, that's because
I'm very important to me.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.681
Yeah, we definitely shot
the right one.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.126
I'm reconsidering.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.964
Still...

03:35.120 --> 03:36.451
I might have given
my life for her.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.127
God, we would have made
such a handsome couple.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.130
So, how did that happen?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.641
Ash:
My asshole hand.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.928
It came back,
grew another me.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.485
Same shit, different day.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.880
Things were going fine
with Amanda, too,

03:51.080 --> 03:52.127
but that went south

03:52.280 --> 03:53.850
all because of
that goddamned book.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.644
No disrespect,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.529
you were the one
who read from it.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.920
No disrespect, Kelly,

03:59.080 --> 04:01.321
if you live in the past,
you hurt the future.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.323
Now, this book has
some freaky weird power.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.687
The sooner it's six feet under,
the better.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.001
First we got to deal
with these bodies.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.527
We can't have hot and sexy
coming back to ruin our day.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.889
And I say that
with all due respect to her.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.368
Well, brains before beauty.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.010
Brad:
Hello?

04:24.840 --> 04:26.365
Pablo:
Aw, shit.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.522
We got company.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.841
Happy campers coming at you.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.082
Hello?

04:34.040 --> 04:37.044
Uh, hey.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.361
What are you guys doing here?

04:38.520 --> 04:39.885
Brad got us lost.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.530
Brad:
It wasn't my fault.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.523
The trees, they, uh--

04:43.720 --> 04:46.371
you know, it's like the trail map
just stopped making sense.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.204
Can we crash here, maybe?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.567
( Chuckles )
In this tiny cabin?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.881
No, no, no.
The three of us here,

04:52.040 --> 04:54.202
we kind of fill it up to capacity.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.930
Plus, there's
a few dead bodies in there.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.560
Dead animal bodies.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.883
Right, because maybe
we're veterinarians.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.041
Really bad ones.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.283
We specialize in
a very radical form of surgery.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.249
Or we're just hunters.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.050
I think the point is
there's no room at the inn,

05:10.240 --> 05:11.730
so you guys might just
have to beat it. Sorry.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.202
But maybe we could just camp
in the front yard?

05:16.720 --> 05:17.926
Can you give us a second?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.209
Okay, look,
there is no way in hell

05:22.360 --> 05:23.407
they're going to stay here,

05:23.560 --> 05:24.766
'cause they're
going to get possessed,

05:24.920 --> 05:27.241
then they're going to be
on the night train to Killadelphia.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.244
With stops in Chokelahoma City
and Die-ami.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.925
- Nice.
- I thought you'd like that.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.411
Oh, hey, sorry
to break up your moment,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.728
but we can't just send them
back into the woods.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.006
Who knows
what else is out there?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.083
It's a hell of a lot safer
out there than here.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.607
And you're just worried
about the little sister.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.171
Brad:
...chainsaw...

05:43.360 --> 05:44.486
Yeah, I am.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.449
Her name's Heather
and she's super cute.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.767
I don't know
much else about her.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.604
That's all you have to know.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.125
Okay, look, you two
are going to take them

05:52.280 --> 05:53.486
the back way to Elk Rapids.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.687
Man, what back way?

05:54.840 --> 05:56.569
There's a trail right up
behind the cabin,

05:56.720 --> 05:57.767
goes to civilization.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.610
Then get your <i>asses</i> back here
because I need you.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.446
In the meantime, some of us
have to slice and dice.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.284
Good luck.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.171
So, change of plans.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.130
( Crickets chirping )

06:15.560 --> 06:19.042
( eerie chanting
in foreign language )

06:19.200 --> 06:21.646
( trees creaking )

06:24.800 --> 06:27.485
It's cool of you guys to show us
the way out of here.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.971
Oh, yeah, well,

06:29.120 --> 06:31.407
anything to get out of a house
of dead animals, right?

06:31.560 --> 06:32.766
( laughs )

06:32.920 --> 06:34.968
Listen, I know you're not hunters

06:35.160 --> 06:36.810
or veterinarians.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.486
Not normal ones, anyway.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.005
<i>What are you guys up m?</i>

06:41.160 --> 06:43.845
What? Uh...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.651
we're getting you
and your family to Elk Rapids.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.490
Okay, fine, it's a secret.
You know what?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.563
If you didn't have a girlfriend,
I'd find a way to get it out of you.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.843
Whoa.
What do you mean, "girlfriend"?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.685
Well, I heard you were
seeing someone.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.161
From who?

06:59.320 --> 07:01.368
From-- from her.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.162
Is it serious?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.169
I'm not sure.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.885
( Ghostly roar)

07:15.240 --> 07:17.004
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.205
Chopping up my evil clone.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.727
Maybe someday that'll feel weird.

No.

No, we are not having
this conversation.

You should use me.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.446
No. I already did that dance.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.290
Made my life a living hell.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.966
Only because
you're trying to fight me.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.805
Stop fighting.
Admit it!

09:04.960 --> 09:07.008
You're not all good, either.

09:07.160 --> 09:12.644
Be smart for once.
Use me.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.800
No. You're taking a dirt nap.

09:16.960 --> 09:21.170
Ash, if you bury me,
you stop being a Superman

09:21.320 --> 09:24.005
and go back
to being a stock boy.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.491
- No.
- Yes!

09:25.640 --> 09:27.483
Nope. Not this guy.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.165
I've got possibilities.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.481
Book:
To do what?

09:30.640 --> 09:33.484
Have a family?
Become president?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.846
Get rich?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.162
None of that's
ever going to happen.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.368
I'm what makes you special.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.000
Blah, blah, blah.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.844
Play's over, Shakespeare.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.843
Amanda, I'm sorry
for what I must do to you.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.002
I promise I'll be a gentleman
and respect your modesty

09:58.200 --> 10:00.202
while I cut you
into small pieces.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.366
Well, maybe just one last
little peek at those--

10:06.520 --> 10:08.045
Shit.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.561
Amanda?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.727
Brad: You know what?
I like the forest in the fog.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.723
It kind of glows.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.370
Yeah, day or night,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.722
there's always something
beautiful out here,

10:28.880 --> 10:30.609
even if it's hard
for some people to see it.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.128
Hey, I voted
for Lake Havasu, okay?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.245
So, Heatherjust told me
that I got a girlfriend?

10:42.400 --> 10:45.244
That's weird.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.085
Yeah.
She said you told her that.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.403
- I did.
- Why?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.922
I don't think
she's good enough for you.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.447
What's wrong with her?

10:57.600 --> 11:01.400
Come on, you know
how crazy girls can be.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.246
Yeah. I'm learning.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.721
Look, Pablo, I'm sorry, okay?

11:07.880 --> 11:08.927
But it's not a good idea

11:09.080 --> 11:11.606
to get involved
with someone right now.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.921
What? Why?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.890
Because life expectancy
is real short out here.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.087
Brad:
Just enjoy the view.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.083
And I don't want to
have to deal with that aftermath.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.285
Neither should you.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.611
That's not how I want to live.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.569
- ( Whooshing )
- Oh, my God.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.328
- Watch out. Stay back.
- What is it? What is it?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.489
( rasping )

11:40.640 --> 11:42.847
( chittering )

11:50.440 --> 11:52.966
It was just a...

11:53.120 --> 11:54.645
- Raccoon.
- Eew.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.404
Brad: Guys? Guys?
What the hell?

11:56.560 --> 12:00.326
You know, it makes
for real good eating.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.970
I've never heard that before.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.326
Oh, yeah.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.166
Makes a real robust
and savory stew.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.970
We should keep moving.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.400
Come on.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.450
( Rustling )

12:13.600 --> 12:14.647
Brad:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.325
Whoa!
Hang on! Hang on!

12:16.480 --> 12:17.970
Let's look before we leap
this time, huh?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.167
Get out of the way, Brad.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.163
Excuse me, but my husband
works in forestry,

12:21.320 --> 12:22.446
and I think you should
listen to him.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.045
He needs to stand clear
of the trees, all right?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.487
Why? So you can shoot
another innocent animal?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.001
( Screaming )

12:29.160 --> 12:31.686
( Brad continues screaming )

12:31.840 --> 12:33.683
( screaming )

12:35.160 --> 12:37.561
<i>Hello, pussies!</i>

12:37.720 --> 12:40.371
Ash was supposed
to chop you up!

12:40.520 --> 12:43.000
Guess he can't do anything right.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.366
Brad:
No!

12:44.520 --> 12:46.602
- Don't! Stop! Stop!
- ( Amanda laughing )

12:48.240 --> 12:50.208
- Amanda: Ha ha! Ha ha!
-( hammers clicking )

12:50.360 --> 12:52.727
- Ha ha!
- Holy shit! Shit!

12:53.840 --> 12:55.046
( Moans )

12:55.200 --> 12:58.249
( screaming )

13:00.600 --> 13:02.967
Kelly:
Oh, my God!

13:03.120 --> 13:06.203
- Pablo: Oh, shit.
- Oh, God.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.202
- Aah!
' oh' my God!

13:10.360 --> 13:12.727
- Put him down!
- Aah!

13:12.880 --> 13:15.087
Aah! Shit!

13:15.240 --> 13:17.811
Drop him!

13:17.960 --> 13:20.201
Why? Is that what Ash
would want you to do?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.051
- Heather: Oh, God.
- Hello! I'm Pablo.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.680
I do whatever
Ash wants me to do.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.729
Oh, oh! Hi, I'm Kelly!

13:27.880 --> 13:30.167
I do whatever
Ash wants me to do, too.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.563
Hello, Kelly.
Do you love me?

13:33.720 --> 13:36.246
'Cause I love you.
Ha ha ha!

13:36.400 --> 13:38.402
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!

13:38.560 --> 13:40.403
- Ha ha!
- Shut up!

13:40.560 --> 13:42.881
" Shut up!
- Aah!

13:53.080 --> 13:54.286
Ha!

13:54.440 --> 13:56.204
Ha ha!

13:56.360 --> 13:57.964
- ( Amanda laughing )
-( Kelly screaming )

13:58.120 --> 14:00.930
- Get it off!
- Aah!

14:01.080 --> 14:02.923
Ha ha ha!
( sucks in breath )

14:03.080 --> 14:04.491
You're next, hot stuff.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.290
- ( Screams )
- Leave her alone!

14:11.440 --> 14:14.444
( Panting )

14:15.840 --> 14:18.571
( distant screams )

14:20.440 --> 14:22.602
(grunting )

14:25.880 --> 14:28.611
( panting )

14:38.160 --> 14:40.322
( roars )

14:40.520 --> 14:41.681
Ahh.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.642
Mmm.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.331
Before you die,
I want you to know

15:02.480 --> 15:04.642
there is no heaven.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.048
I'm going to peel the skin off
your pretty little face!

15:10.200 --> 15:11.690
Get away from her!

15:14.600 --> 15:16.204
( Squelches )

15:16.360 --> 15:17.850
( growls )

15:20.680 --> 15:21.727
Oh!

15:21.880 --> 15:24.690
It's time your loyalty
to Ash got rewarded.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.366
YOu!

15:45.520 --> 15:46.521
Amanda.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.365
Rub)!-

15:49.520 --> 15:50.681
Ash did this to me.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.521
Don't trust her!
She's lying!

15:54.720 --> 15:56.051
The truth.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.890
The truth is...

16:08.040 --> 16:11.249
we can still be together
if you want.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.561
Well, I'd like that.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.247
But our time has not yet come.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.888
(whimpering )

16:22.120 --> 16:24.088
( screaming )

16:24.240 --> 16:26.641
( rustling )

16:26.800 --> 16:29.087
0w!
($0bs)

16:31.760 --> 16:33.762
Did you really have to do that?

16:35.560 --> 16:36.766
Amateurs.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.048
Who the hell is that?

16:39.200 --> 16:42.044
L-- my-- my '99-

16:42.200 --> 16:43.531
Inn:

16:53.080 --> 16:54.764
I'm almost done.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.969
This isn't real.
It can't be happening.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.286
I wish you were right.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.125
Ruby: Better tell Goldilocks
to shut her baby blues.

17:02.280 --> 17:07.002
This fairy tale's
about to get real bloody.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.640
Oh, jeez. Just stop it.
What are you doing?

17:09.839 --> 17:11.842
Pablo:
It's okay. Listen.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.809
- We got to chop 'em up...
-( Ruby whistling )

17:13.960 --> 17:16.088
or else they could come back
as something much worse.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.810
- ( Continues whistling )
- Nothing is worse than this.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.567
Trust me.
Everything is worse than this.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.131
Ruby:
Tough little bugger.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.931
So who the hell are you
and what do you want with Ash?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.650
I'm the one
who's going to stop him

17:28.800 --> 17:30.962
turning more people
into monsters.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.645
What the hell are you
talking about?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.131
Ash doesn't turn anyone
into monsters.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.367
- He fights them.
- ( Ruby laughs )

17:35.520 --> 17:38.808
Yeah, he's the only one
standing in their way.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.961
And me, too.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.969
I stand in their way
all the time.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.004
Oh, yeah,
he fights them, all right.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.481
He's still got that book,
hasn't he?

17:47.640 --> 17:48.801
The Necronomicon?

17:50.240 --> 17:51.287
Because, you know, that--

17:51.440 --> 17:55.490
that is at the root
of all this trouble.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.690
Listen,
Amanda was my friend, too.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.526
It doesn't matter
what Ash's intentions are.

18:07.320 --> 18:12.406
As long as he's got that book...

18:12.560 --> 18:16.007
a trail of dead bodies
is going to follow.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.401
So take me to him.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.729
( Thunder crashing )

19:04.200 --> 19:05.247
Ash: Whoa!

19:05.400 --> 19:06.890
Why the hell
are you on this property?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.845
And where's the book
you stole from my family?

19:10.040 --> 19:11.929
Easy, Nancy Drew.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.570
The hell you guys doing?
Selling tickets?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.724
She's a Knowby,
and she saved us from Fisher.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.763
Well, not all of us.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.400
Okay. All right.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.801
Well, number one, it's my book.
Has been for 30 years.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.769
Number two,
I'm on your damn property

19:25.920 --> 19:28.321
because I'm here to save
a little something I call Earth.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.081
You know what I've been doing
these past 30 years?

19:32.240 --> 19:34.083
Cleaning up your messes
so they don't destroy

19:34.240 --> 19:37.084
a giant thing
that everyone calls the Earth.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.483
And what have you accomplished
in all these years?

19:40.640 --> 19:44.611
You put a chainsaw
on your stump?

19:44.760 --> 19:46.000
Congratulations.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.123
You know, it's a lot harder
than it looks.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.441
Name one other person
you know

19:49.600 --> 19:51.170
that has a functioning
chainsaw arm.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.685
Ruby:
This has to stop.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.410
You've got the Necronomicon

19:54.560 --> 19:55.607
and you need to give it to me.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.967
- So where is it?
- None of your beeswax.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.121
I will tell you this, though.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.566
Pretty soon it's going to be
six feet under.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.808
- 0h. you're going to bury it?
- Bet your bippy.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.122
I found that out
during a drug-fueled trip.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.123
So your entire plan
to save the world

20:07.280 --> 20:08.770
comes courtesy of a bong hit?

20:08.920 --> 20:12.129
No. I didn't smoke the drug, lady.
I drank the drug,

20:12.280 --> 20:14.965
which gave my mind
a backstage pass to the reality show.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.645
I'm going to bury it
in the basement,

20:16.800 --> 20:17.961
then I can finally say to evil,

20:18.120 --> 20:19.565
"Hey, evil,
why don't you eat my butt?"

20:19.720 --> 20:21.802
Wonderful imagery.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.201
But it won't work
if you just bury the book.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.964
That's what my vision says.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.491
Then your vision is stupid.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.166
Yeah, you're right.
It is kind of stupid.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.005
Almost as stupid
as your stupid face.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.208
(grunts)

20:36.560 --> 20:38.085
You say one more dumb thing...

20:38.240 --> 20:40.322
I'm going to say
a lot of dumb things.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.563
That didn't work.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.842
Okay! Okay, kids!
Break it up.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.844
All right, just everyone
take a deep breath, okay?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.527
Look, if the book
is just buried like before,

20:54.680 --> 20:58.366
then some other fool like you
can come along and use it.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.329
For the Necronomicon
to be laid to rest,

21:00.480 --> 21:02.369
it has to be dismantled.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.410
- Destroyed.
- Impossible. Tried it.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.291
With what? Your peashooter
and your power saw?

21:08.440 --> 21:11.011
Don't talk bad
about Moe and Larry here.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.248
They've served me
very well over the years.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.210
Sure, they can kill the body
that evil inhabits,

21:16.360 --> 21:18.522
but that spirit just
keeps coming back, doesn't it?

21:20.520 --> 21:22.204
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.203
You see, the book and the evil
that surrounds it

21:24.360 --> 21:26.522
really aren't affected by
such things.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.210
No, you got to use...

21:29.520 --> 21:31.887
- ...the Kandarian dagger.
- I know what that is.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.725
Yeah, so why don't you
show me the book

21:34.880 --> 21:36.120
and we'll finally end this?

21:36.280 --> 21:38.726
I got to talk to my peeps.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.129
All right, guys,
what do you think?

21:44.320 --> 21:47.051
Okay, well,
she did save our lives,

21:47.240 --> 21:48.571
and I think she smells
kind of nice.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.404
Although I haven't showered
in a really long time,

21:50.560 --> 21:51.607
so I'm probably
not the best judge.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.091
Kelly:
I don't know.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.891
I mean, if I've learned
anything from you, Ash,

21:56.080 --> 21:58.082
it's that if something seems
too good to be true,

21:58.240 --> 22:00.083
it probably is.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.083
And also,
she doesn't smell that nice.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.402
Man, making decisions
is so hard.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.085
Let's look on the bright side.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.765
We're balls deep in this shit.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.729
There's nowhere to go but up.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.405
Yeah, up shit's creek.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.364
Without a paddle.

22:17.240 --> 22:22.610
( Ghostly whispering )

22:25.760 --> 22:28.604
Okay, you have to use
the Kandarian dagger

22:28.760 --> 22:30.285
to deface the book.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.444
Literally.
Rip the face off the binding.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.444
And once you start,
you cannot stop,

22:37.600 --> 22:38.840
no matter how difficult it gets.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.611
Don't stop till
the face-lift is done.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.285
Got it.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.124
Okay, book,
this is going to hurt you

22:45.280 --> 22:46.611
a lot more than
it's going to hurt me.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.451
Ash!

22:49.600 --> 22:51.284
- ( Thunder crashes )
- Yeah, I forgot to mention

22:51.440 --> 22:53.169
this thing has become
quite the Chatty Cathy.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.369
Not for long.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.801
Ash!

22:58.960 --> 23:03.284
No!

23:04.480 --> 23:08.963
Please!

23:09.120 --> 23:10.804
Sto...

23:12.160 --> 23:14.845
(gurgling, coughing)

23:15.000 --> 23:17.651
(gurgling continues)

23:17.800 --> 23:20.804
( roars )

23:32.160 --> 23:35.687
Oh, Jesus.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.171
Whew.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.004
( Thunder crashes )

23:39.160 --> 23:40.525
Okay. Now what?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.250
Now present the book to me.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.841
Then the power
of ownership will be mine

23:45.000 --> 23:46.570
and the ritual
will be complete.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.848
Sounds simple enough.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.486
What's wrong?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.961
Uh, nothing.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.207
Then Why'd you stop?

23:58.360 --> 23:59.361
Well, I don't know.
It just--

23:59.520 --> 24:00.885
should I say
good-bye to it or what?

24:01.080 --> 24:02.969
With the book defaced,
time is of the essence.
