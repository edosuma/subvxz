00:02.580 --> 00:05.180
What are the characteristics of a gay guy?

00:08.420 --> 00:13.260
We'll have a pre-drink on Friday.
We were wondering if you guys want to come.

00:13.260 --> 00:16.620
I don't really know.
I think...

00:16.620 --> 00:19.300
Isak has brain damage, you know?
We're coming.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.680
Text me when we're supposed to be there.
-Yeah, I'll figure it out.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.440
Hello.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.120
And this here is Sonja, my girlfriend.
-Sonja.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.040
Isak.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.760
<i>[Why are you lying?
Talked to Emma and her friends.]</i>

00:45.320 --> 00:53.000
<i>[Hi. I just want to say that we talked to your friends and know that you didn't have other plans. If you're not interested, that's great, but you don't have to give me false hope by saying you're coming to the pre-drink when you aren't, that's really asshole-ish.]</i>

00:53.040 --> 00:56.020
<i>[Hello?! Is it so hard to answer!?!!]</i>

00:56.040 --> 01:00.520
<i>[Sorry that I called you an asshole.
It's possible you have a good reason, but can you answer?]</i>

01:00.540 --> 01:03.060
<i>[ASSHOLE!]</i>

01:14.040 --> 01:14.940
Hello.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.720
Hello, traitor.
-Hey man.

01:18.060 --> 01:21.460
Traitor?! Fuck.
-That was dumb of you.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.340
You just betrayed us.
What's up with that?

01:24.880 --> 01:28.440
Yeah, sorry man.
Yeah...

01:29.420 --> 01:33.520
It was just really stressful.
-Stressful? What do you mean, stressful?

01:36.360 --> 01:40.320
I'll arrange a new pre-drink, okay?
-Yeah, but what kind of stress?

01:47.040 --> 01:51.400
There was just something with my mom.
-Your mom? What's up with her?

01:53.960 --> 01:56.560
She stressed out.
-She stressed out?!

01:56.560 --> 02:00.620
My mom has been stressed ever since
I arrived on this earth, and you're talking about stress?

02:01.460 --> 02:02.320
Huh?

02:06.500 --> 02:08.440
How's it going with her?

02:11.060 --> 02:12.100
She's fine.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.900
Just arrange a new pre-drink.
Case closed.

02:21.220 --> 02:23.960
Case closed.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.280
Closed.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.400
<i>[Another bible verse from his mom.]</i>

05:57.340 --> 05:59.600
Hi!
-Can you hold this?

06:02.080 --> 06:08.940
I will be sending out invites…
I wanted to ask you if we can have the pre-drink a bit earlier?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.600
No. I won't be having a pre-drink.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.000
Why not?

06:18.040 --> 06:22.920
I can't because I live with other people and
they don't want to have a pre-drink.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.380
But I talked to Eskild and he said it was completely fine.

06:28.920 --> 06:36.360
Of course he said that. But I talked to Linn,
and Linn does not want to have a pre-drink at ours.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.040
Honestly though Isak, what <i>does </i>Linn want?

06:41.160 --> 06:44.000
Linn doesn't want anything.
Linn is deeply depressed.

06:44.400 --> 06:49.740
You should take responsibility
and make her socialise a little.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.540
Take responsibility!

06:52.360 --> 06:54.540
You're hosting that party, Friday at 6.

07:26.200 --> 07:26.940
Hi!

07:35.620 --> 07:36.880
I was wondering…

07:37.540 --> 07:41.120
I need advice, so to speak.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.760
Because there's this really sweet girl in the first year

07:44.980 --> 07:48.960
and I managed to make a quite angry.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.940
She has a good reason to be,
because I fucked up a promise.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.240
That wasn't nice.

07:59.420 --> 08:06.920
That's why I was wondering,
do you think I should go and shoot myself?

08:07.820 --> 08:10.720
Or perhaps she'll forgive me?

08:11.880 --> 08:16.800
It'd be cool if she does it in 20 years.
As long as she does it sometime.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.720
Jerk.
-I'm a jerk?

08:21.940 --> 08:23.380
You think I'm a jerk?

08:24.260 --> 08:29.940
Fuck, then there are two girls who think I'm a jerk.
She's sweet, and then you.

08:31.220 --> 08:35.420
Oy, did you just try to kill me with that look?
Was that what you were trying?

08:36.980 --> 08:38.960
Am I really such a jerk?
You think?

10:01.880 --> 10:03.160
Good job!

10:03.940 --> 10:08.360
We want six dancers for the theatre.

10:08.360 --> 10:13.140
You'll get an answer within the week.
Thanks!

10:15.400 --> 10:16.520
Show's over, guys.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.440
Really good. So good! Wow.

10:20.660 --> 10:23.940
Did he need to be so gay?
-Huh?

10:24.380 --> 10:27.480
You didn't notice?
-He was ultra gay.

10:29.860 --> 10:32.500
What's up with you dissing people who are gay?

10:32.640 --> 10:35.000
I didn't diss him.
But you could see it.

10:36.960 --> 10:41.420
Yeah, but you're just pointing
out that he's gay or what?

10:41.540 --> 10:43.740
Really great observation, Isak.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.280
What's up with you? You're being so pissed.
-With me? Huh?!

10:48.400 --> 10:49.820
Me?
-Yeah.

10:49.820 --> 10:53.580
You're the one who's fucking grouchy about everything!
-Grouchy?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.420
Ever since we walked into
the classroom, you were...

10:56.420 --> 10:58.420
What the fuck are you talking about?
-Hello.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.500
You forgot this Friday.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.260
Is it yours?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.520
I think it's mine.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.520
Forgot where?

11:15.780 --> 11:16.760
In the cafeteria.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.380
Who's that dude?
He's just some theatre nerd from Vilde's group.

11:30.740 --> 11:34.700
Oh fuck! My dream yesterday. Fuck!

11:34.700 --> 11:42.000
Vilde was in it. She was some dominatrix, SM chick
who punished me with sex because I hooked up with a first year.

11:43.540 --> 11:47.100
Sickest dream I've ever had! So wild.

11:50.480 --> 11:55.680
Dominatrix? What are you talking about?
-Dominatrix… I don't know how to call it.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.760
What did she do?
-She was the boss. I didn't do anything.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.000
Black clothes?
-Yeah!

12:06.500 --> 12:08.060
Whip and everything.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.280
So sick.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.140
You have a weird imagination.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.340
What kind of music do you like?

12:50.600 --> 12:51.920
That's difficult.

12:52.260 --> 12:56.520
My favorite music is Justin Bieber!

12:57.880 --> 13:02.180
Oh my god.
-Was that bad? Oh no!

13:02.180 --> 13:05.940
I'm getting a headache.
-You get a migraine from Justin Bieber?

13:06.460 --> 13:08.580
A chronic Justin Bieber migraine.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.520
I can't leave. I live here.
Could you leave?

13:11.880 --> 13:17.160
You're throwing me out because I like him?
What kind of music do you like?

13:17.160 --> 13:22.580
I'm more into 90's hip hop.
Do you know anything about it?

13:24.700 --> 13:27.380
Eh, no.
-You don't know anything about it?

13:27.380 --> 13:31.000
I do...
-Nas?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.920
Nas? Have you heard of him?
-Huh?!

13:33.920 --> 13:37.340
He made the best album of all time.
Illmatic. Have you heard of it?

13:37.340 --> 13:39.500
Ill?
-Illmatic!

13:39.820 --> 13:42.460
Ill as in sick. And Matic.

13:43.660 --> 13:47.580
Hi! So nice to see you. Hi.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.120
Vilde. Nice to meet you.
Sonja.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.280
I don't know if you know this but...

13:57.000 --> 14:00.420
Do you feel this strap here?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.600
You feel it?
-Yeah.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.480
I sticks out just under my arm.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.540
It will be like that until I get home.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.840
You should be happy you're not a girl.

14:14.020 --> 14:18.220
It's really annoying to be a girl.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.740
Especially when-

14:33.900 --> 14:37.760
I'm starting to think you're bonding too much.
-Finally! Hello!

14:40.960 --> 14:43.360
<i>Kose</i> group!
-Cool apartment.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.520
Thanks.
-It's so cool here. Sick.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.820
It's a shared apartment. There's always
cool people here. Like Eskild!

14:52.400 --> 14:55.460
Have you met Eskild?
-No, I don't think so.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.120
He's gay. He's really sweet.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.760
I love gay people. They're sweet.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.660
You don't think that's a bit of
a superficial generalization?

15:06.920 --> 15:10.820
How so? By saying gay
people are funny?

15:10.820 --> 15:14.800
That's like saying all muslims are terrorists.
-What?!

15:15.520 --> 15:20.140
No, that's too much.
It's not like that.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.180
To be funny is really positive.

15:24.540 --> 15:28.520
To be a terrorist is really negative.

15:29.520 --> 15:35.520
That's not what I'm saying, but you are
generalizing. Not all gays are funny.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.160
This is really boring.
Isak, come dance with me

16:47.760 --> 16:52.980
People! We have ordered 4 taxis.
And we have to go now!

16:55.640 --> 16:59.380
Who took my phone?
Who used my phone to play music?

16:59.380 --> 17:04.540
Does everyone have their tickets?
The tickets are really important.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.960
Can someone call me?
Please. I can't find my phone.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.840
Isak! Me, Sonja, and Even
are taking a taxi together.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.120
Do you want to come with us?
-No, I'm cycling.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.820
Yeah, okay. Fine.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.360
Didn't you take a taxi with the others?

17:48.100 --> 17:49.240
I have a bicycle.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.700
Were you having a good time with Emma?

18:08.640 --> 18:09.920
She's something.

18:13.520 --> 18:18.540
Do you know me and Sonja have been
dating since she was 15 or something?

18:22.060 --> 18:22.840
Okay.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.440
I'm noticing that we're growing
apart more and more.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.960
But I can't dump Sonja.

18:41.020 --> 18:41.940
Okay.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.360
If I dump Sonja, she'll think
it's because she has an aluminum leg.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.480
Huh?
-You didn't know?

18:54.100 --> 18:58.280
Aluminum leg?
-Yeah, her entire foot was amputated.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.780
What? How did that happen?

19:05.220 --> 19:10.180
She stepped on a land mine in Tjøme
when she was nine years old.

19:11.820 --> 19:12.940
Shit.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.420
It was quite bad.
-I didn't know.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.680
But it's going better with her now.

19:20.840 --> 19:26.900
She's gotten really good help from...

19:27.520 --> 19:32.740
What's it called? A physiotherapist.
They've helped with her motoric skills.

19:33.220 --> 19:38.900
You know aluminum technology has come a long way.
You can hardly see that she limps.

19:41.980 --> 19:42.960
You're joking?

19:44.360 --> 19:48.480
You're joking? Yeah?
Fuck!

19:48.960 --> 19:50.440
How can you joke about that?

19:50.720 --> 19:53.340
You think there are land mines in Tjøme?

19:53.500 --> 19:57.080
I don't fucking know!
You can't joke about something like that!

19:57.620 --> 19:59.820
I could've joked about
something way worse!

20:00.940 --> 20:04.200
No! That's a very serious
thing to be kidding about.

20:04.200 --> 20:09.380
I could've joked about a dick.
That would've gone too far.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.420
Dick...

20:12.900 --> 20:13.760
Too far.

20:20.560 --> 20:25.540
I don't think aluminum technology was ...
-Was that what betrayed me?

20:29.140 --> 20:30.360
But...

20:33.360 --> 20:34.460
She's sweet.

20:41.180 --> 20:42.160
Sonja.
