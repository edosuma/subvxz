WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.132
I've tried every single thing.

00:11.133 --> 00:13.932
I thought he was really gonna
change, but, like, this is

00:13.933 --> 00:15.966
Lamar.
Why do I treat him better than I

00:15.967 --> 00:17.599
- treat myself?
- I feel like you

00:17.600 --> 00:21.232
shouldn't put so much energy
into it.

00:21.233 --> 00:23.432
There's one more thing I
have to talk to you guys about,

00:23.433 --> 00:25.466
but I don't want you guys to get
mad.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.599
- You're having a baby.
- Yeah.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.032
I know Khloe's probably
feeling...

00:29.033 --> 00:30.999
- Congratulations.
- So, have you told

00:31.000 --> 00:34.466
- anybody about Rob and Chyna?
- No.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.366
- How do you feel?
- I mean, it's Rob's

00:36.367 --> 00:38.366
life.
How do you feel?

00:38.367 --> 00:40.332
I just want him to be happy.

00:40.333 --> 00:43.066
My brother and I have
always had such a strong

00:43.067 --> 00:45.932
connection.
What bothers me is that Rob has

00:45.933 --> 00:50.167
completely just disconnected
from me.

01:02.433 --> 01:03.999
I'm better at

01:04.000 --> 01:07.399
- basketball than Khloe.
- You get one shot.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.766
That's not... you're

01:08.767 --> 01:11.866
better?
You know what I hate?

01:11.867 --> 01:18.132
So, yesterday on the red carpet,
what's up with my inner thighs?

01:18.133 --> 01:19.532
Nothing.
I didn't see anything.

01:19.533 --> 01:22.466
Yeah, they're
nasty, and someone wrote, "What"

01:22.467 --> 01:25.566
kind of ho works out every day
and doesn't have good thighs?"

01:25.567 --> 01:28.266
And I was like, "You're right.
I agree with you, what kind of"

01:28.267 --> 01:31.032
ho does work out every day and
doesn't have good inner thighs?"

01:31.033 --> 01:32.632
What happened?
What's wrong with your inner

01:32.633 --> 01:34.066
- thighs?
- I will show you my

01:34.067 --> 01:35.799
picture.
I'm so pissed at my legs.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.099
If a ho eats Popeyes, then...

01:38.100 --> 01:40.199
We had Popeyes once on
the airplane.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.366
When was the last time we had
Popeyes?

01:42.367 --> 01:46.432
You ass.
They're right though.

01:46.433 --> 01:48.366
Have you seen this?
I don't know what she's talking

01:48.367 --> 01:49.866
about.
I mean, maybe I'm looking at

01:49.867 --> 01:51.432
- something wrong.
- That inner thing.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.232
Yeah, what are
you... Oh, right there?

01:53.233 --> 01:55.366
Yes, I want it to be hard.

01:55.367 --> 01:58.099
I swear, when I was fatter, I
had more muscle definition.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.866
Well, come on, let's
take care of it right now.

01:59.867 --> 02:03.233
Oh balls, we're gonna die.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.266
Hi!
Oh, my goodness, it's my

02:29.267 --> 02:32.032
favorite girl!
Hi!

02:32.033 --> 02:36.499
Are you so excited to come to
lunch with Lovey? Huh?

02:36.500 --> 02:37.966
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

02:37.967 --> 02:40.432
- Want to sit in your chair?
- No.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.266
No.
Okay, this is fun.

02:42.267 --> 02:44.532
- I like that top.
- Thank you.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.466
Have... look, I have the pants
on, too.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.666
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.899
Oh, I like those.
I want to get some stuff like

02:49.900 --> 02:51.432
- that.
- Dolce.

02:51.433 --> 02:54.166
Might be a little much
for me, but I like it.

02:54.167 --> 02:57.632
Thanks.
I had the craziest appointment

02:57.633 --> 03:01.266
at my doctor's today.
'Cause I've been struggling with

03:01.267 --> 03:04.499
just, you know, getting older.
And it was so interesting

03:04.500 --> 03:08.432
because your body can really
break down if you're not

03:08.433 --> 03:10.866
careful, and we really need to
take care of ourselves.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.366
So, what?
Do you feel tired?

03:12.367 --> 03:13.966
- Is that why you went?
- Yeah, just kind of,

03:13.967 --> 03:17.366
like, not great, tired.
Like, welcome to 60, thank you.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.266
Yeah, but, I mean, you
look good and you're running

03:19.267 --> 03:21.032
around.
I mean, you do more than most

03:21.033 --> 03:23.599
- people do in their 30s.
- The problem is there's

03:23.600 --> 03:27.966
no reason to be, like, 20 pounds
overweight.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.132
You're not 20 pounds overweight.

03:30.133 --> 03:35.299
Aw, thank you.
My life is always crazy, and I'm

03:35.300 --> 03:37.932
constantly under a lot of
pressure and have a lot going

03:37.933 --> 03:42.032
on, so I need to figure out a
way to increase my energy, and

03:42.033 --> 03:45.699
just be able to have a little
more stamina during the day,

03:45.700 --> 03:49.166
because I'm exhausted and I need
to step it up.

03:49.167 --> 03:52.132
At the end of the thing, the
doctor goes, "Well, I'm going to"

03:52.133 --> 03:56.666
give you this kit.
And I need you to go home and

03:56.667 --> 04:00.599
"basically collect a stool
sample."

04:00.600 --> 04:02.632
Oy. You realize we're
at lunch, right?

04:02.633 --> 04:04.699
Yes, but I just don't
think I can play with my poop

04:04.700 --> 04:06.799
- like that.
- I don't think I want

04:06.800 --> 04:08.366
to hear you play with your poop
like that.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.099
And then I have to mail it...

04:10.100 --> 04:11.899
My daughter's three, I
don't think she even wants to.

04:11.900 --> 04:15.866
- She has pooped before.
- I pretend women don't.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.298
- Really?
- Yeah, I don't like to

04:17.300 --> 04:18.966
- hear that stuff.
- Have you ever been in a

04:18.966 --> 04:21.999
- room when a girl has pooped?
- Absolutely not.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.399
- No. Not at all.
- Okay.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.666
Gross.
No.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.600
Right, Poosh?

04:41.267 --> 04:44.966
Hey, KoKo.

04:44.967 --> 04:47.299
You sounded like
Jonathan Cheban.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.732
Jonathan says that.
"Hey, KoKo."

04:50.733 --> 04:53.266
You, like, blend into
this chair.

04:53.267 --> 04:55.466
- I almost can't find you.
- I dress according to

04:55.467 --> 04:57.166
theme.
I'm a chameleon.

04:57.167 --> 04:58.899
- What's going on?
- You know it's my

04:58.900 --> 05:01.466
birthday this weekend.
Or did you not?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.599
- No, I did.
- Are you gonna be

05:03.600 --> 05:06.632
involved, is the question, now
that me and Kourtney aren't

05:06.633 --> 05:09.832
- together?
- Uh, hello.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.532
- Yup, I'm going.
- True family.

05:12.533 --> 05:15.432
Yup.
I am super excited that Scott

05:15.433 --> 05:17.666
invited me to his birthday party
in Vegas.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.732
This could not have come at a
better time.

05:19.733 --> 05:22.432
I definitely need a good
distraction right now.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.866
This is gonna be, like, super
fun and I'm excited.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.099
- Are you going to 1 OAK?
- Yeah.

05:27.100 --> 05:31.199
Oh, P.S. I wanted to have a
family dinner at Nobu on

05:31.200 --> 05:33.932
Thursday night here in Malibu,
and the next day we'll go to

05:33.933 --> 05:35.699
Vegas and it'll be like a big
party.

05:35.700 --> 05:39.432
I have a busy week.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.366
- Do you?
- Thursday, Nobu.

05:42.367 --> 05:45.366
Vegas, Friday.
Then I have a spray tan at 8:45.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.332
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.232
Things are filling up quick.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.133
Filling up.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.966
- Hey, Don.
- Uh-oh, look who we have

06:01.967 --> 06:03.332
- here.
- Have you ever

06:03.333 --> 06:04.799
- trained my mom?
- I haven't gave her the

06:04.800 --> 06:06.466
- full matrix yet.
- Oh,.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.799
Wait, I need to Snapchat this.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.432
Why?
Do I have camel toe?

06:10.433 --> 06:12.732
- No.
- Ta-da!

06:12.733 --> 06:14.999
So, this is the day.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.266
Yeah.
I'm trying to find workouts

06:17.267 --> 06:19.332
because I really want to stay
strong.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.799
- Okay.
- And I need cardio, and

06:20.800 --> 06:22.999
I need to keep it going, you
know?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.766
Yeah, so you can feel your best.

06:25.767 --> 06:28.966
My mom hasn't been really into
working out lately.

06:28.967 --> 06:32.932
And she has been complaining
about not feeling well and just

06:32.933 --> 06:35.532
- feeling low energy.
- So we'll do a warm-up

06:35.533 --> 06:37.766
first, get some blood flowing,
and then we'll stretch

06:37.767 --> 06:39.032
- everything out.
- Okay.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.266
I'm happy that she
wants to get back into it,

06:41.267 --> 06:45.366
because one of the biggest
things that helps Khloe and I is

06:45.367 --> 06:47.632
- working out.
- Let's just go for a

06:47.633 --> 06:49.199
basic jog.
We start down here.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.099
- Oh, a jog.
- Yeah, here we go.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.599
We're just going there.
Your pace, your flow.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.166
Over there, you're going over
there.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.066
- What?
- Kourtney, I used to do

06:58.067 --> 07:01.066
- track in high school.
- You did?

07:01.067 --> 07:03.432
Yup.
You know what? I still got it.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.166
Let's go.

07:05.167 --> 07:07.366
One up, then drop all the way
down.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.799
Don't stop, Mom.
Come on, you can do this.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.899
- Whoo! Baby!
- I set the pace.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.599
- You have to keep up with me.
- Easy.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.432
Okay, I see you showing off now.

07:17.433 --> 07:19.799
Last one for the abs.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.232
- Last one?
- Three, two, one.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.199
Let's do three sets.
Flip back over.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.699
- What?
- That was one set.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.966
- We're not done?
- Each quarter has three

07:29.967 --> 07:31.933
- sets.
- Oh,.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.932
- Come on.
- Let's go.

07:36.933 --> 07:38.932
I got this.
Let's go!

07:38.933 --> 07:41.766
- Do it, Mom.
- Three up, then right

07:41.767 --> 07:44.432
back down.
Four up, there you go.

07:44.433 --> 07:47.632
Five up.
One, up, drop, good.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.666
Four. Do it.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.799
- Five. Knees up.
- I have not really been

07:52.800 --> 07:56.366
exercising to the extent that I
used to.

07:56.367 --> 07:59.332
I guess I shouldn't have been so
surprised that this is such a

07:59.333 --> 08:01.066
- challenge.
- Two sets down, one to

08:01.067 --> 08:04.232
go.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.699
- Second quarter, second quarter.
- Here we go.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.999
But you know what?
I'm not gonna let anything stop

08:10.000 --> 08:14.366
me from giving this everything I
have, and I'm gonna push through

08:14.367 --> 08:16.166
- this workout.
- How you doing?

08:16.167 --> 08:17.766
- Really great.
- Good.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.599
That's a wrap.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.799
Oh, my God!
My legs, they have a mind of

08:21.800 --> 08:23.232
their own!

08:23.233 --> 08:25.899
They're running away!
I can't control them!

08:25.900 --> 08:33.900
Help get me back!
I can't help myself!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.332
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:39.332 --> 08:42.366
So, you decided
that you're ready to do this.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.432
I just want to make
sure that it's bulletproof, that

08:44.433 --> 08:46.966
no matter our marital status, I
still could help Lamar if, God

08:46.967 --> 08:48.766
forbid, this were to happen
again.

08:48.767 --> 08:52.366
If this happens
again, and Lamar is not in sound

08:52.367 --> 08:56.932
mind and Lamar is on life
support, you get to make the

08:56.933 --> 09:01.466
- decision regardless...
- Of marital status.

09:01.467 --> 09:02.666
- Yeah.
- Yes.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.699
- Perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.666
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay. Bye.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.099
- Okay. Bye.
- What's happening?

09:09.100 --> 09:11.266
- You're getting a divorce again?
- What I was just

09:11.267 --> 09:14.932
talking to Elizabeth about was
Lamar asked that, if anything

09:14.933 --> 09:17.166
were to happen to him again,
that I always be, like, his

09:17.167 --> 09:20.032
medical advisor and, like, make
all those decisions 'cause he

09:20.033 --> 09:22.566
has no one else to trust.
And I said, "But when we get a"

09:22.567 --> 09:24.599
divorce, I legally don't have
those rights."

09:24.600 --> 09:26.966
So, we met with lawyers.
That, if anything were to

09:26.967 --> 09:30.266
happen, regardless of our
marital status, I will still

09:30.267 --> 09:32.932
help him.
And so I heard they were done,

09:32.933 --> 09:35.932
so I just called Elizabeth to
confirm they were done, and then

09:35.933 --> 09:37.299
- we'll re-file.
- Yeah.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.632
Like, this... how long
am I gonna sit in this for?

09:39.633 --> 09:41.499
- Yeah, no.
- This is ridiculous.

09:41.500 --> 09:46.166
I'm finalizing my divorce papers
today with my lawyer, again, for

09:46.167 --> 09:47.899
the second time.
Lamar and I have spoken about

09:47.900 --> 09:51.032
it; we're both on board.
So, we are going to file

09:51.033 --> 09:54.666
tomorrow, and so it might be
public, but we don't really

09:54.667 --> 09:57.199
- anticipate much.
- All right.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.099
- Okay?
- Yeah.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.866
Okay.
Regardless if Lamar and I have

10:01.867 --> 10:04.966
spoken about it and that we're
on the same page, it's still...

10:04.967 --> 10:07.699
bittersweet.
I was holding out, you know, to

10:07.700 --> 10:10.332
help Lamar, but Lamar's not
helping himself, so I have to do

10:10.333 --> 10:12.666
what's best for me.
And I have to move on and just

10:12.667 --> 10:15.232
be done; like, there's no
reason to hold on to this.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.332
It will always be love and I
will always, like, love Lamar

10:18.333 --> 10:21.132
and, like, be his friend, but
it's time for me to start the

10:21.133 --> 10:23.033
next chapter of my life.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.866
You gonna go to Scott's
birthday?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.966
I don't know.
I said I'll have to decide last

10:28.967 --> 10:31.699
minute.
Sometimes Scott can just take

10:31.700 --> 10:34.499
any little thing and think that,
like, we're getting back

10:34.500 --> 10:38.032
- together.
- "Khloe Kardashian files

10:38.033 --> 10:40.466
for divorce again."
Nobody cares but me.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.999
Not that we don't care.
I just was, like...

10:42.000 --> 10:48.167
I don't need anybody to care.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.832
- Okay.
- How are your headaches?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.699
Fine.
But I mainly give them to

11:08.700 --> 11:12.266
myself, I think.
I just stress myself out.

11:12.267 --> 11:14.466
That's not good.
I've been doing that my whole

11:14.467 --> 11:17.032
life.
Take a page out of my book and

11:17.033 --> 11:19.266
don't do it.
That's not good.

11:19.267 --> 11:22.299
Khlo!
Come to the kitchen.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.032
- The boss is calling.
- Oh.

11:24.033 --> 11:26.699
- I'm the boss.
- Not of me.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.466
Okay.
You gonna go to Scott's

11:28.467 --> 11:30.932
- birthday?
- Yup. Hey, boss.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.466
- Hey.
- Are you gonna go?

11:32.467 --> 11:34.499
I don't know.
I said I'll have to decide last

11:34.500 --> 11:36.232
minute.
See what's going on with the

11:36.233 --> 11:38.832
- kids.
- You should go.

11:38.833 --> 11:43.366
Scott invited me to
his birthday party in Las Vegas.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.632
And I'm just not sure if I want
to go.

11:45.633 --> 11:50.266
I mean, I'm so happy that Scott
and I are getting along so well

11:50.267 --> 11:54.699
and that we're co-parenting, but
I think hanging out with Scott

11:54.700 --> 11:59.032
without the kids, Scott can just
take any little thing and run

11:59.033 --> 12:02.032
with it, and think that, like,
we're getting back together

12:02.033 --> 12:05.966
tomorrow.
Right now, I can't even wrap my

12:05.967 --> 12:09.666
head around that idea.
There's so much work that would

12:09.667 --> 12:13.932
be involved, and I'm so not even
there yet.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.666
Wait, so when are you going?

12:15.667 --> 12:17.832
I have a shoot on
Friday, so I would have to leave

12:17.833 --> 12:19.999
after my shoot.
But that's when he told me he

12:20.000 --> 12:22.066
- was leaving anyway.
- And he said the plane

12:22.067 --> 12:24.666
- was gonna come back right after.
- Yeah, he said he

12:24.667 --> 12:26.766
- has something the next day.
- What does he have the

12:26.767 --> 12:28.799
- next day?
- Atlantic City pool

12:28.800 --> 12:31.066
- party.
- What?

12:31.067 --> 12:34.766
- That's wild.
- You are cute.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.133
You're cute.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.932
- Hey!
- What is this,

12:53.933 --> 12:55.666
- off-season?
- Yeah.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.066
What are you icing your leg for?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.799
I...
I was working out with Kourtney

12:59.800 --> 13:06.366
and Khloe with that Don guy.
I ran 20... 35 laps.

13:06.367 --> 13:08.799
That's ridiculous.
Like, for what?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.266
Well, just I'm going
through this sluggish stage, and

13:11.267 --> 13:13.799
I used to be in such great shape
and now I cannot get it

13:13.800 --> 13:17.799
together.
I've been really good about

13:17.800 --> 13:20.032
showing up for my workouts with
Don.

13:20.033 --> 13:24.032
And he's really tough.
I don't think I've ever been so

13:24.033 --> 13:28.699
tired and exhausted in my life.
But it's really gonna pay off.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.399
I just know it is.
No pain, no gain.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.966
I mean, I just want to feel good
and be healthy.

13:33.967 --> 13:37.032
Water aerobics.
You could do the big move from

13:37.033 --> 13:39.999
Corey could hold
you up, spin you around.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.832
That's normal.

13:41.833 --> 13:45.199
- Oh, my God.
- I understand Kris

13:45.200 --> 13:48.399
wants to keep her youth and
keep her body looking good, but

13:48.400 --> 13:51.332
now she's starting to work out
with Kourtney and Khloe?

13:51.333 --> 13:54.332
They're little animals and they
work out every single day.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.832
Of course you're gonna go break
a knee or something.

13:56.833 --> 14:02.132
She's not 20 years old anymore.
Why are you trying to be

14:02.133 --> 14:04.999
something you're not?
Everyone loves you as you are.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.966
Don't think you need to try to
keep up with them.

14:06.967 --> 14:09.032
They're psychotic.
You look beautiful.

14:09.033 --> 14:11.066
You're, like, the hottest
60-year-old on the planet.

14:11.067 --> 14:15.399
That's a known fact.
You look about 40, but you are

14:15.400 --> 14:17.899
60.
You can't be running 5,000 laps

14:17.900 --> 14:19.866
in a tennis court with a bunch
of kids.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.999
- You'll kill yourself.
- Yeah.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.966
I mean, at least your
outfit looks nice and everything

14:24.967 --> 14:27.066
- matches.
- Thank you.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.266
Other than different
sweats to the shoes, but okay.

14:29.267 --> 14:31.167
I know.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.432
P was telling me last

14:41.433 --> 14:43.566
night how many different names
she had.

14:43.567 --> 14:47.632
She goes, "Sometimes I go by
P, sometimes KiKi calls me"

14:47.633 --> 14:48.932
Peepaleep."

14:48.933 --> 14:51.332
"Sometimes I go by
Poosh, sometimes I go by

14:51.333 --> 14:53.299
Poosh-kaloosh."
Yeah, North goes... she

14:53.300 --> 14:54.799
- calls her Peepaleep now.
- That's cute.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.332
'Cause she heard me say
it. Hi.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.932
- Hey.
- By the way, are you

14:57.933 --> 15:01.266
guys aware that your mom thinks
she's, like, 30?

15:01.267 --> 15:03.866
She's not though.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.032
She's 60.
She's got a lot of pressure.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.766
She just wants to look good, and
she does.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.132
She looks better than any other
60-year-old alive.

15:10.133 --> 15:12.566
But she... honestly, what is she
thinking to come over here and

15:12.567 --> 15:14.066
jump into you and Khloe's
workout?

15:14.067 --> 15:15.366
She wanted to do that.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.466
Yeah, but I feel like
you should've said, "Hey, we've"

15:17.467 --> 15:19.432
been doing this workout a long
time.

15:19.433 --> 15:24.866
Pace yourself."
Yeah.

15:24.867 --> 15:28.066
I mean, Scott is right, and I
think sometimes we just forget

15:28.067 --> 15:30.999
that my mom maybe can't keep up
with us.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.566
But I've seen her do these kind
of workouts, like, our whole

15:34.567 --> 15:37.566
lives, so it's just easy to
forget.

15:37.567 --> 15:41.166
But I do love working out with
my mom, so I really do want to

15:41.167 --> 15:43.199
find something that we can do
together.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.232
All I'm saying is
maybe you could do something

15:45.233 --> 15:48.032
that's more up her alley.
I don't think she needs to,

15:48.033 --> 15:51.132
like, break down on the side of
the road like an old car at this

15:51.133 --> 15:54.067
- point.
- Girl's got to workout.

16:10.067 --> 16:14.099
Hey, Khloe.
This is the most beautiful room.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.399
- Thank you.
- And I love that

16:15.400 --> 16:17.666
- picture of you.
- Mike shot that.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.299
- Stop.
- In St. Barts.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.432
Right, I remember that.
Look at your body.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.699
- I gave birth to that thing.
- You did.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.132
Not that size, but yeah.

16:26.133 --> 16:29.066
- Oh, my God.
- Um... have you talked

16:29.067 --> 16:31.732
- to Rob lately?
- Aw.

16:31.733 --> 16:34.799
You guys haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.466
- That makes me really sad.
- It makes me really

16:37.467 --> 16:40.232
sad.
I text Rob just the other day

16:40.233 --> 16:43.266
for the first time in, like,
weeks, and I was like, "Hey, um",

16:43.267 --> 16:45.566
you know I love you and I miss
you and I really hope Chyna's

16:45.567 --> 16:48.332
pregnancy is going well."
And he just, "I love you, too."

16:48.333 --> 16:50.366
But, like, there's no, like,
effort on his part.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.466
Like, he has never reached out
to me once.

16:52.467 --> 16:56.132
It's just weird 'cause Kourtney,
Kim, Kendall, Kylie, like, no

16:56.133 --> 16:59.566
matter what we're doing, we
always text or FaceTime where...

16:59.567 --> 17:01.766
Yeah, make sure you
guys stay connected.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.699
But no matter how busy
we are, or how in love we are,

17:04.700 --> 17:07.432
or how sad we are, like, we turn
to each other.

17:07.433 --> 17:13.932
So, it's so weird that we don't
talk, and that's bizarre.

17:13.933 --> 17:17.665
Rob and I grew up inseparable.
And I feel like no matter where

17:17.666 --> 17:20.566
I've been in my life, Rob's
always been someone that I lean

17:20.567 --> 17:22.598
onto.
And especially now I'm going

17:22.599 --> 17:25.398
through so much this week, I'm
really missing his support and

17:25.400 --> 17:27.766
just him being there, just
even for me to go to his

17:27.767 --> 17:30.499
room and hang out with him.
You would think, like, with him

17:30.500 --> 17:32.366
starting a family, he would want
to talk about stuff.

17:32.367 --> 17:37.699
I hate to see my kids
in this place.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.099
I know you're
contemplating going to Vegas.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.432
You should consider going 'cause
Khloe really wants to go.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.432
I'm not saying I'm not going.

17:44.433 --> 17:48.299
I don't want to send the wrong
message.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.532
Happy birthday.
Did you invite Rob?

17:50.533 --> 17:53.566
Yeah.
He said, "I'd love to, but",

17:53.567 --> 17:56.599
because of Chyna, I'm not
coming."

17:56.600 --> 17:59.332
With everything else
that's going on, Khloe needs Rob

17:59.333 --> 18:01.633
now more than ever.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.666
Gabbana!
All you do is follow me

18:19.667 --> 18:23.632
everywhere!

18:23.633 --> 18:28.199
Oh, I hate everyone today.
Honestly, it's too much for one

18:28.200 --> 18:29.632
- soul to bear.
- Oh, I see it.

18:29.633 --> 18:33.099
"Khloe Kardashian files for
divorce again."

18:33.100 --> 18:36.199
How do you feel?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.632
Don't try to act like you care.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.266
No, I thought you were
like, "Oh, who cares?"

18:41.267 --> 18:45.299
We've been going around this
circle ten times.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.666
What?
Nobody cares but me.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.499
I'm, like, the only person who
does care.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.466
No one gives a and I
understand why. Whatever.

18:52.467 --> 18:54.099
I don't think no one gives a.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.566
I think we, like, dropped
everything to, like, help you,

18:56.567 --> 18:59.732
you know.
I think as far as your decision

18:59.733 --> 19:02.966
to want to get a divorce again,
I think it's, like, inevitable

19:02.967 --> 19:05.099
and I think that you should.
I think that you shouldn't,

19:05.100 --> 19:07.632
like, live your life, you
know, just...

19:07.633 --> 19:09.932
I don't need anybody,
I don't, I don't need anybody

19:09.933 --> 19:11.966
- to care. I really...
- No, but it's not, uh,

19:11.967 --> 19:14.599
but it's not that we don't care.
I just think it's, like, the

19:14.600 --> 19:18.032
best decision.
So I'm like, don't want to rock

19:18.033 --> 19:20.999
the boat and talk too deep about
it, in case you change your

19:21.000 --> 19:23.766
mind.
I think Khloe acts like she

19:23.767 --> 19:26.032
doesn't need the help and
she's so strong and she doesn't

19:26.033 --> 19:28.466
want the help, but then she
really does need it.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.232
So it's just hard to know how
to be.

19:31.233 --> 19:35.199
But I don't want Khloe to ever
think that we don't care.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.332
It is for my best
interest, but is it hard.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.233
It's so hard.

19:49.267 --> 19:53.532
- North, what's your name?
- Bugs.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.266
"Bugs"?
What's your other name?

19:56.267 --> 19:58.232
- West.
- West?

19:58.233 --> 20:01.532
- Mommy's name is West.
- Yes. And what else is

20:01.533 --> 20:03.332
- Mommy's name?
- Kim.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.466
- Where's your dad?
- Um... Mommy?

20:06.467 --> 20:08.699
- Yeah?
- Where is my dad?

20:08.700 --> 20:11.266
He is at home, resting

20:11.267 --> 20:14.132
- with Sainty.
- "At home, resting with

20:14.133 --> 20:16.866
Sainty."
Thank you.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.432
Where are we going now?

20:19.433 --> 20:26.733
We're going to Nobu,
for Scott's birthday.

20:42.133 --> 20:46.866
- Oh! The birthday boy!
- Happy birthday.

20:46.867 --> 20:48.832
- Love you.
- Oh, that was awkward.

20:48.833 --> 20:52.299
I'm trying to go like this,
and it's like...

20:52.300 --> 20:55.232
I have been looking for
a good picture of us all day.

20:55.233 --> 20:57.599
We have nothing good together?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.666
Like, there was some
funny things that was like...

20:59.667 --> 21:01.599
- Nothing, like, real?
- "...Scott and Kim."

21:01.600 --> 21:03.532
They're gonna leave everyone and
get married."

21:03.533 --> 21:05.332
- Like the same funny things.
- Like they say about

21:05.333 --> 21:07.799
- every single one of them.
- Like, Khloe did it

21:07.800 --> 21:09.733
and I did it.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.566
- Happy birthday, Scott.
- Oh, this is a video?

21:18.567 --> 21:21.799
- I was giving, like, my look.
- Happy birthday.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.999
Thank you. Mwah.
You know, I'm really impressed

21:25.000 --> 21:28.966
that, in the middle of filing
for divorce, Khloe can get

21:28.967 --> 21:31.699
herself up and still come to my
birthday dinner and be

21:31.700 --> 21:34.799
supportive and be loving.
She really is one of the

21:34.800 --> 21:37.432
strongest women I know and have
ever met.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.532
- Come here.
- Can you pass me some

21:39.533 --> 21:41.232
- of that shrimp?
- Why don't you have the

21:41.233 --> 21:43.399
field greens salad here?
It's real good.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.332
I am.
So, Scott, how's your birthday

21:47.333 --> 21:49.166
- going?
- It's been a little bit

21:49.167 --> 21:51.899
of a hectic day, but now it's
nice to just be able to, like,

21:51.900 --> 21:54.366
relax and calm down.
Been pretty good.

21:54.367 --> 21:56.199
Good.
Are you excited for Vegas?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.832
I'm excited that
everybody's coming and stuff

21:57.833 --> 21:59.866
- and we'll all be together.
- Who's all going

21:59.867 --> 22:01.966
- tomorrow?
- Semel.

22:01.967 --> 22:04.266
And then just basically us.
JJ and his wife.

22:04.267 --> 22:07.099
Benny and his wife.
Chris, Cheyenne, Mickey and

22:07.100 --> 22:11.199
that's it.
And then, uh...

22:11.200 --> 22:13.532
Are you guys going or no?

22:13.533 --> 22:17.632
- I don't know.
- I feel like this

22:17.633 --> 22:21.332
table's so big.
For, like, nobody.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.266
I could have invited some
people.

22:23.267 --> 22:25.899
- Did you invite Rob?
- Yeah.

22:25.900 --> 22:29.466
He said, "I'd love to, but...
because of Chyna, I-I'm not"

22:29.467 --> 22:34.766
coming."
Khloe and Rob have been

22:34.767 --> 22:39.999
best friends since the day Rob
was born, and I hate to see them

22:40.000 --> 22:42.832
in a situation where they're not
talking to each other, because

22:42.833 --> 22:45.832
with everything else that's
going on, Khloe needs him now

22:45.833 --> 22:47.733
more than ever.

22:50.667 --> 22:53.832
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you guys did

22:53.833 --> 22:55.899
- this!
- But don't forget,

22:55.900 --> 22:59.099
- you got to take it easy.
- I get that you're in

22:59.100 --> 23:02.166
this new relationship, but it
doesn't mean that you can't

23:02.167 --> 23:05.166
- still be close to all of us.
- You all aren't, like,

23:05.167 --> 23:07.666
that welcoming of this
relationship, so it's not

23:07.667 --> 23:09.567
that easy.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.699
- Did you invite Rob?
- Yeah.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.599
He said, "I'd love to, but
because of Chyna, I-I'm not"

23:21.600 --> 23:25.766
coming."
Kourt, why don't you

23:25.767 --> 23:28.299
- give Scott one of his presents?
- Ah, I don't want to.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.699
Your birthday, we want
to celebrate with you.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.899
Open the bottom one from us.

23:32.900 --> 23:36.066
- Mason made you a card.
- Ah! Did you see this

23:36.067 --> 23:38.232
card my son made?
You took some real time.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.232
And what, did you shoot a BB gun
through it, too, while you were

23:40.233 --> 23:43.566
at it?
Oh, I love these.

23:43.567 --> 23:46.032
Oh, my God.
These seriously got to be huge

23:46.033 --> 23:48.566
for you.
Could you get these made with

23:48.567 --> 23:52.132
my... with a...?

23:52.133 --> 23:54.732
I do love having the whole
family join me for my birthday.

23:54.733 --> 23:57.932
I'm having a great time.
Thank you, guys!

23:57.933 --> 24:00.666
You know, it's really nice to
feel that we're all still close,

24:00.667 --> 24:02.700
and we can all still do things
together.

24:06.833 --> 24:09.666
Whoa! Look, look, look.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.666
You want to blow out
the candles for me, Poosh?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.733
You want to help me?

24:29.733 --> 24:31.800
Yeah!

24:42.967 --> 24:45.299
Just cheese.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.332
And just one pizza.
It's just us.

24:48.333 --> 24:51.532
And North will have a piece.
Caroline's coming over to bring

24:51.533 --> 24:53.299
- you pizza.
- That's cute.

24:53.300 --> 24:57.232
Yeah. Um...
I feel really bad that, like,

24:57.233 --> 25:01.332
Khloe is feeling really, like,
that we don't care or, like,

25:01.333 --> 25:03.599
do anything.
I mean, I feel like we just need

25:03.600 --> 25:07.266
to, like, do something nice
for her, like, even if it's,

25:07.267 --> 25:11.466
like, a fun spa day at home or
go get her favorite food, like,

25:11.467 --> 25:14.999
just a fun something for her, to
where she feels like we care.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.132
- Yeah.
- I know you're

25:17.133 --> 25:19.332
- contemplating going to Vegas.
- Mm-hmm.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.632
But I really feel like
you should really consider going

25:22.633 --> 25:25.399
- 'cause Khloe really wants to go.
- Mm-hmm.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.332
I want her to have a fun time,
and if she's in the mood to go,

25:29.333 --> 25:33.066
you know, have a great time,
like, she's definitely been

25:33.067 --> 25:35.932
there for me.
But I also have to do what's

25:35.933 --> 25:40.399
best for me.
I'm not saying I'm not going.

25:40.400 --> 25:45.566
I just don't want to send him
the wrong message because, like,

25:45.567 --> 25:48.166
he'll take any little thing and
run with it.

25:48.167 --> 25:50.599
- I get it.
- And I feel like I

25:50.600 --> 25:53.432
did my own thing for my
birthday... like, I went to

25:53.433 --> 25:57.766
Iceland... and I don't want to
always have to do everything

25:57.767 --> 25:59.766
- together.
- I guess I just feel bad

25:59.767 --> 26:02.466
- for Khloe.
- I really don't know

26:02.467 --> 26:06.866
if I feel like going to Vegas,
but I do know that Khloe

26:06.867 --> 26:10.732
really wants to go, and I think
she needs a fun night out.

26:10.733 --> 26:13.599
So, it's just hard because I
really just don't know what to

26:13.600 --> 26:15.500
do.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.799
Why won't you even look at me?

26:18.800 --> 26:24.632
Talk to me.

26:24.633 --> 26:26.666
- Scott, what's the plan?
- I'd like to have a

26:26.667 --> 26:29.632
little, like, pre-game sex with
Kourtney before we go to dinner.

26:29.633 --> 26:31.866
- Okay.
- If at some point this

26:31.867 --> 26:34.799
plane started going down, could
we make out or have sex?

26:34.800 --> 26:37.366
- No.
- It's your last shot.

26:37.367 --> 26:44.167
Your last shot at everything?

26:53.700 --> 26:56.332
- Yo.
- Hello.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.932
- What up?
- Kourt, this is Scott.

26:57.933 --> 27:00.632
- What up? What up?
- What up, girl?

27:00.633 --> 27:02.399
You're looking too good up in
here.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.932
- I know.
- Damn!

27:03.933 --> 27:06.032
- Oh, no.
- I'm about to try to

27:06.033 --> 27:09.099
- holla at this chick, ya dig?
- Good luck.

27:09.100 --> 27:13.199
I've decided to go to Vegas for
Scott's birthday because Khloe

27:13.200 --> 27:17.632
really wants to go and she needs
a fun night out, and I think

27:17.633 --> 27:20.866
that's, like, one of the ways I
can be there for her.

27:20.867 --> 27:22.966
We are going to Vegas, baby.

27:22.967 --> 27:30.766
Scott's birthday.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.199
- Yeah!
- Feel like every day is

27:32.200 --> 27:35.266
my birthday.
Like, you know what I'm saying?

27:35.267 --> 27:37.266
All right, I'll see y'all on the
other side, boy.

27:37.267 --> 27:40.066
So, Scott, what's the

27:40.067 --> 27:41.499
- plan?
- I'd like to have a

27:41.500 --> 27:44.866
little, like, pre-game sex with
Kourtney before we go to dinner.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.199
- Okay. Perfect.
- Then a little birthday

27:47.200 --> 27:49.799
sex, like, after I'm in the
club.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.132
- Okay.
- And then just...

27:51.133 --> 27:52.866
Any plans that might
include us, or no?

27:52.867 --> 27:54.999
Oh, no, nothing
involves any of you.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.199
You're all just here just so I
could be with Kourtney.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.699
Dear Lord Jesus,
please make... have us have a

27:59.700 --> 28:02.066
safe flight to Vegas.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

28:02.067 --> 28:04.099
- Amen.
- Jesus' name. Amen.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.732
If at some point this
plane started going down, could

28:06.733 --> 28:09.266
- we make out or have sex?
- No.

28:09.267 --> 28:11.966
- It's your last shot.
- Your last shot at

28:11.967 --> 28:15.232
everything, 30,000 feet up,
you're never gonna have anything

28:15.233 --> 28:16.599
- ever again?
- Nope.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.132
- You still wouldn't?
- Still wouldn't.

28:18.133 --> 28:20.033
This chick is solid!

28:32.700 --> 28:37.199
Got a lot of good
energy up in here.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.732
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Scott.

28:38.733 --> 28:41.566
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Not everybody get

28:41.567 --> 28:43.932
excited all at once.

28:43.933 --> 28:45.932
What is Khloe doing?
She has her earphones on?

28:45.933 --> 28:48.066
- Yeah.
- Khlo, what-what...

28:48.067 --> 28:49.899
like, this is what goes on?
You're just, like, at my

28:49.900 --> 28:52.132
birthday dinner and just, like,
having a whole other, like...

28:52.133 --> 28:54.499
Are you really in my
conversation right now?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.566
'Cause I have not bothered one
person over here.

28:56.567 --> 28:58.299
Obviously that's the
problem; I want you to 'cause

28:58.300 --> 28:59.732
you're, like, the life of the
party.

28:59.733 --> 29:02.232
I am the life of the
party, but right now I'm doing

29:02.233 --> 29:03.799
something else.
And then when I get off, then

29:03.800 --> 29:05.366
I'll be the life of the party
again.

29:05.367 --> 29:06.832
All right, let me know
when you're ready.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.399
Right, so I'll let you know.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.799
Come on, dear...
Come here.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.232
- No, no, no.
- This is my birthday.

29:12.233 --> 29:13.699
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.732
Going to the chapel.

29:15.733 --> 29:19.566
Do I have to move
down to the end of the table?

29:19.567 --> 29:22.499
I know Kourt is really
concerned about sending the

29:22.500 --> 29:26.166
wrong message to Scott, but I
think all of us, and Kourtney

29:26.167 --> 29:29.232
herself, would feel really weird
if Scott actually stopped

29:29.233 --> 29:31.132
flirting with her.
I mean, look at them.

29:31.133 --> 29:32.932
They're so comfortable around
each other.

29:32.933 --> 29:35.166
And I don't care if they're
together or not, this is just

29:35.167 --> 29:37.199
- gonna be their dynamic.
- Man, this is one

29:37.200 --> 29:39.332
- miserable table.
- We're chilling.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.432
What do you want us to do, dance
on the table?

29:41.433 --> 29:43.332
I mean, if I had it my
way, yeah.

29:43.333 --> 29:49.433
- Should we go to the club?
- Whoo! Vegas!

30:05.200 --> 30:07.766
Everybody say, "Happy
birthday, Scott!"

30:07.767 --> 30:15.767
Happy birthday!

30:25.700 --> 30:28.166
Ah, ah!
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

30:28.167 --> 30:33.166
I'll get her.
I'll break her down.

30:33.167 --> 30:34.499
- You all right, Mom?
- Yeah.

30:34.500 --> 30:42.500
Do you want to make out?

30:43.567 --> 30:47.332
I'm so happy that
Scott and I are getting along so

30:47.333 --> 30:51.399
well and that we're having so
much fun just being silly.

30:51.400 --> 30:55.099
And I think I was maybe
overanalyzing the situation,

30:55.100 --> 30:57.866
because there's no reason we
just can't all have fun

30:57.867 --> 30:59.767
together.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.299
You look really good.
"Thanks, Mom, you look good,

31:11.300 --> 31:12.999
too."
You look good, too, Mom.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.066
Do you want something

31:15.067 --> 31:16.866
- to eat, Rob?
- Uh, I'm all right.

31:16.867 --> 31:20.332
There's a chicken and
broccoli plate here for you.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.166
- Doesn't that look yummy?
- Mm-hmm.

31:22.167 --> 31:25.732
- So healthy.
- Thanks.

31:25.733 --> 31:28.066
You want another napkin, Boo?

31:28.067 --> 31:31.132
Let's put it like this.
This is what I used to do to Rob

31:31.133 --> 31:33.466
- when he was little.
- Yeah.

31:33.467 --> 31:36.466
Um... so have you

31:36.467 --> 31:38.999
- talked to Khloe lately?
- No.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.832
Hmm.
You're her best friend.

31:40.833 --> 31:43.099
And she hasn't talked to you in
a really long time.

31:43.100 --> 31:44.732
Doubt I'm her best friend.

31:44.733 --> 31:47.732
You're her best friend.
You really are.

31:47.733 --> 31:50.366
She loves you so much

31:50.367 --> 31:53.066
- and she misses her brother.
- Well, she should be

31:53.067 --> 31:55.632
careful what she says and...
'cause she does this all to

31:55.633 --> 31:57.599
- herself.
- I get that you're in

31:57.600 --> 32:00.332
this new relationship that's
amazing for you.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.666
- Mm-hmm.
- But it doesn't mean

32:01.667 --> 32:04.832
that you can't still be close to
all of us.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.232
- That's how life works.
- No, I know, but y'all

32:07.233 --> 32:10.899
aren't, like, that welcoming of
this relationship, so you can't

32:10.900 --> 32:13.466
expect me to just be like, "Oh,
let's all hang out and"

32:13.467 --> 32:16.866
everything's cool and fine."
It's not that easy.

32:16.867 --> 32:20.199
Khloe has always been
there for Rob, and she needs him

32:20.200 --> 32:23.666
now more than ever.
So, this is his turn to be there

32:23.667 --> 32:26.099
for her.
My hope is just that Rob

32:26.100 --> 32:33.799
realizes how important this is
and that he makes it right.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.499
I had Khloe's
pajamas dropped off at her

32:36.500 --> 32:38.499
- house.
- Kourtney and I want to

32:38.500 --> 32:40.699
do something for Khloe so that
she feels loved.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.232
What the hell is going on?

32:42.233 --> 32:43.699
- Hey, Khlo!
- Why are we all wearing

32:43.700 --> 32:45.600
these, the outfit?

32:53.900 --> 32:56.399
I get that you're in
this new relationship that's

32:56.400 --> 32:57.932
- amazing for you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:57.933 --> 33:01.266
But it doesn't mean
that you can't still be close to

33:01.267 --> 33:03.132
all of us.
That's how life works.

33:03.133 --> 33:06.499
No, I know, but y'all
aren't, like, that welcoming of

33:06.500 --> 33:09.499
this relationship, so you can't
expect me to just be like, "Oh",

33:09.500 --> 33:11.966
let's all hang out and
everything's cool and fine."

33:11.967 --> 33:14.199
- It's not that easy.
- Don't you think that

33:14.200 --> 33:17.366
having a baby is one of the most
amazing things that can happen

33:17.367 --> 33:20.332
to you in your life?
And that's what you want to

33:20.333 --> 33:22.866
share with everybody, and, like,
the family and...

33:22.867 --> 33:24.266
- Of course.
- Let us share the

33:24.267 --> 33:27.699
journey with you.
It's nice if you still have a

33:27.700 --> 33:31.032
bond with your family because we
all love you so much.

33:31.033 --> 33:35.532
And I want you and Khloe to be
okay and happy and connected.

33:35.533 --> 33:37.699
It's your sister.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.999
- Mom...
- You know, she's had a

33:40.000 --> 33:44.832
hard year in going through...
a bad time with all the Lamar

33:44.833 --> 33:48.832
stuff still.
And she couldn't need her family

33:48.833 --> 33:51.666
more than she does now.
And that includes you.

33:51.667 --> 33:55.232
So, if you made an effort just
to kind of mend the feelings

33:55.233 --> 33:59.799
that are hurt and just try to
get back on track with everyone,

33:59.800 --> 34:04.732
it would be so easy if you would
just make the first move.

34:04.733 --> 34:08.099
No, I know.
I get it.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.132
I'll reach out to Khloe.

34:13.833 --> 34:17.966
I'm really happy that
Rob is gonna reach out to Khloe.

34:17.967 --> 34:22.199
And I think once they're
reunited, it's gonna be good.

34:22.199 --> 34:26.366
No way.

34:26.367 --> 34:29.065
- Who the is this?
- Uh, it's your brother.

34:29.067 --> 34:35.498
No way!
You finally called me!

34:35.500 --> 34:37.831
- How is everything?
- I'm good, I'm good.

34:37.833 --> 34:41.899
- I'm just moving along and I'm...
- How's Chyna doing?

34:41.900 --> 34:43.831
Getting bigger and bigger.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.199
- That's a good thing.
- I was just checking to

34:46.199 --> 34:49.565
see how you are and see if I
could see you soon.

34:49.567 --> 34:52.099
What?
This is the best phone call

34:52.100 --> 34:54.399
- ever.
- Yeah.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.831
- Yeah.
- When do you want to

34:55.833 --> 34:58.299
- see me?
- Uh, maybe tomorrow or

34:58.300 --> 35:01.799
- this week or...
- Oh, my God, that soon?

35:01.800 --> 35:05.566
This is so exciting.
But will you really and don't

35:05.567 --> 35:09.266
- just say it?
- Yes, yes, yes.

35:09.267 --> 35:12.466
Okay, I don't know why
you've been avoiding me, but

35:12.467 --> 35:15.466
there's really no reason and Dad
would not be happy with either

35:15.467 --> 35:18.632
- one of us right now.
- I agree.

35:18.633 --> 35:21.532
- I love you.
- Love you.

35:21.533 --> 35:29.533
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.766
This is a great

35:37.767 --> 35:39.932
- backyard for a party.
- I know.

35:39.933 --> 35:43.332
So, I had Khloe's
pajamas dropped off at her

35:43.333 --> 35:45.832
house.
So she could just wear them

35:45.833 --> 35:49.466
- here.
- Cute.

35:49.467 --> 35:51.832
Kourtney and I want to do
something for Khloe.

35:51.833 --> 35:53.966
Something super chill at the
house.

35:53.967 --> 35:57.299
Just like a little pampering
Khloe moment so that she feels

35:57.300 --> 35:59.532
- loved.
- What the hell is going

35:59.533 --> 36:00.866
- on?
- Hey, Khlo!

36:00.867 --> 36:03.666
- Hi!
- Why are we here and

36:03.667 --> 36:05.866
why are we all wearing these,
the outfit?

36:05.867 --> 36:09.699
You're my second
and most honored sister.

36:09.700 --> 36:13.632
- Heir of all I possess.
- Who's your first?

36:13.633 --> 36:15.399
Kim.
She's my first sister that I've

36:15.400 --> 36:18.032
ever had.
But you're the honored sister,

36:18.033 --> 36:20.632
- the heir of all I possess.
- "The heir of all you

36:20.633 --> 36:21.899
- possess"?
- It's just from a

36:21.900 --> 36:23.766
- book that I read to the kids.
- Oh, I thought you

36:23.767 --> 36:26.632
meant you are leaving me
everything in your will.

36:26.633 --> 36:28.966
I doubt you're the type of
person who has a will.

36:28.967 --> 36:30.266
- What?
- Kourtney seems like,

36:30.267 --> 36:33.199
"When you die, you just die.
No one should care about, like,

36:33.200 --> 36:36.799
material possessions."
No, really, what's happening?

36:36.800 --> 36:39.366
I just wanted you
to feel adored...

36:39.367 --> 36:41.899
- Mm-hmm.
- Admired, loved

36:41.900 --> 36:44.666
- and cared about.
- I do feel... but why?

36:44.667 --> 36:46.499
- What happened?
- Well, what hasn't

36:46.500 --> 36:49.899
- happened?
- True story.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.832
- That is the question.
- True story.

36:52.833 --> 36:54.699
You've been through a
lot lately.

36:54.700 --> 36:57.399
You just re-filed
for divorce.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.599
And even though you act
strong and, like, together, it's

37:00.600 --> 37:02.999
just, like, sometimes you need
TLC.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.732
This is a pampering session to
just keep you going.

37:06.733 --> 37:09.399
Thank you, guys.
This just shows that, you know,

37:09.400 --> 37:11.999
my sisters do love me and they
are aware of everything I'm

37:12.000 --> 37:14.632
going through.
I do not have a clue what I

37:14.633 --> 37:17.766
would do without them.
When you have people that you

37:17.767 --> 37:20.032
know you can depend on, even
though you're going through

37:20.033 --> 37:21.666
, you just know
everything's gonna be okay

37:21.667 --> 37:23.666
eventually.
Do you guys want to know who the

37:23.667 --> 37:25.399
- hottest guy in the world is?
- Who?

37:25.400 --> 37:28.266
There's this guy that
became famous because of his

37:28.267 --> 37:30.399
- mug shot.
- What if we find him and

37:30.400 --> 37:33.266
- try to set him up with Khloe?
- Like, he's just, like,

37:33.267 --> 37:37.299
such a hot man.
Kourtney, how hot is this guy?

37:37.300 --> 37:39.799
- Ooh, he is hot.
- What did he go to jail

37:39.800 --> 37:42.099
- for, is the question?
- "Single charge."

37:42.100 --> 37:44.366
Felon in possession of a
firearm.

37:44.367 --> 37:47.366
"He had to go to a transitional
housing facility."

37:47.367 --> 37:48.932
- Honestly...
- Damn!

37:48.933 --> 37:52.166
Having a man on house
arrest is the best man to have.

37:52.167 --> 37:54.932
- They can't go anywhere.
- I'll be Bonnie.

37:54.933 --> 38:02.933
- He can be Clyde.
- Ooh!

38:06.267 --> 38:08.266
This doesn't seem that safe.

38:08.267 --> 38:10.466
You could probably
do a good butt thing.

38:10.467 --> 38:12.799
Oh, G... oh, yeah.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.999
I'm sweating like a beast.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.466
Okay, and one.
Two.

38:17.467 --> 38:20.332
- Pull it out now, three.
- I think Don told me

38:20.333 --> 38:23.499
he does Pilates.
Whoa!

38:23.500 --> 38:26.499
What in the?
Could've taken my head off.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.999
Who knew Pilates was so
dangerous?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.999
What are you doing now?
Do you even think you're doing

38:31.000 --> 38:34.066
- anything right?
- Oh,.

38:34.067 --> 38:35.999
Looks like you're
about to give birth.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.999
Well, that's what I
thought these were for.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.399
Here we go, coming round.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.499
Mason number three or four,
where are you? Hello?

38:42.500 --> 38:46.532
I took Scott's
advice to heart and got my mom

38:46.533 --> 38:49.966
a Pilates machine.
It'll be great for my mom.

38:49.967 --> 38:53.566
And it's actually something that
I've really been wanting to do.

38:53.567 --> 38:58.432
So it's good for both of us.
Feeling good.

38:58.433 --> 39:00.666
- Good.
- What in the

39:00.667 --> 39:02.499
- world?
- Hey, Mom.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.766
I can't believe you
guys did this!

39:04.767 --> 39:06.866
Do you know Don does Pilates?

39:06.867 --> 39:11.466
And Pilates is gentle on your
body, but it's also such a great

39:11.467 --> 39:14.899
- workout.
- Oh, my God, fantastic.

39:14.900 --> 39:17.232
This is supposed to transform
your body.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.032
But don't forget, you
got to take it easy.

39:19.033 --> 39:21.332
Wait, look at the... you
put your feet in these.

39:21.333 --> 39:24.199
Oh, this is by Balanced Body?
Thank you so much!

39:24.200 --> 39:25.699
- Yeah.
- Your body is gonna

39:25.700 --> 39:28.266
be so on "fuegs."
This is where your new

39:28.267 --> 39:30.732
- chapter of your life starts.
- Right here in this

39:30.733 --> 39:34.332
garage.
I push myself pretty hard, so I

39:34.333 --> 39:36.399
appreciate it.
And this is something we could

39:36.400 --> 39:39.232
do together.
I may not be able to go zero to

39:39.233 --> 39:42.599
60, but this is the perfect
balance for my body.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.399
It's fantastic that I have a
family that really wants me to

39:46.400 --> 39:49.499
be the best that I can be.
And I think that the fact that

39:49.500 --> 39:54.032
they've gone this far to
surprise me means a lot.

39:54.033 --> 39:56.966
This is so cool!
I have, like, my own Pilates

39:56.967 --> 39:58.867
studio.
I could charge you to come over.

40:08.533 --> 40:11.499
- Well, well, well.
- Gabbana.

40:11.500 --> 40:15.599
What do we have here?
I got dressed up for you.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.899
Got my... whole arm wet
for you.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.932
- No, two hands.
- Wait, I'm wet.

40:22.933 --> 40:25.799
It's okay.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.399
Oh, Robbie.
You could give a normal hug.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.667
Like, two hands is fine.

40:35.400 --> 40:41.632
Would you like to sit in my
office?

40:41.633 --> 40:43.967
So serious. What's happening?

40:48.400 --> 40:52.866
I've missed you.
Well, why won't you even look at

40:52.867 --> 40:55.000
me?
Talk to me.

41:06.600 --> 41:11.066
I've missed you.
Well, why won't you even look at

41:11.067 --> 41:13.266
me?
Talk to me.

41:13.267 --> 41:17.532
So I heard you and

41:17.533 --> 41:19.266
Scott are having a baby or
something.

41:19.267 --> 41:21.732
- Rob, don't be weird.
- Okay.

41:21.733 --> 41:23.332
I've been calling you,
I've texted you.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.732
No, you have not.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.332
Do you want to look at
our text messages?

41:26.333 --> 41:29.532
I'm pretty sure the last
text messages, uh, you blocked

41:29.533 --> 41:31.032
- me.
- That was when we were

41:31.033 --> 41:32.766
fighting.
And then I said, "I love you, I"

41:32.767 --> 41:35.199
miss you, I hope Chyna's having
a good pregnancy."

41:35.200 --> 41:36.632
- Yeah.
- And then you wrote, "I

41:36.633 --> 41:39.532
"love you, too," and that was it.
When is she supposed to have a

41:39.533 --> 41:41.066
- baby?
- In November.

41:41.067 --> 41:42.566
You excited or nervous?

41:42.567 --> 41:46.266
I'm excited, I'm not nervous.

41:46.267 --> 41:48.832
Um, so, like, the more

41:48.833 --> 41:51.132
you guys come around, the easier
it's gonna get, but if... the

41:51.133 --> 41:53.166
more you guys stay away, it's
just gonna stay this weird

41:53.167 --> 41:55.599
place.
Or even make it weirder.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.666
Yeah.
I just feel like the situation

41:57.667 --> 42:00.766
is just, like, not very
welcoming for her to feel like,

42:00.767 --> 42:03.166
"Oh, I should go be BFF with
so and so."

42:03.167 --> 42:05.299
No, and I think it
should be natural anyway, but...

42:05.300 --> 42:07.499
You know, obviously I
hang out with her all the time,

42:07.500 --> 42:08.932
- or...
- I know it's gonna be

42:08.933 --> 42:11.199
different; like, obviously you
have her.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.166
And even if that's your... like,
you don't have to bring her

42:13.167 --> 42:16.366
around, like, that's totally
your choice, but it's also not

42:16.367 --> 42:18.766
fair for you to, like, eliminate
yourself from our lives.

42:18.767 --> 42:20.066
- Yeah.
- Like, my life at

42:20.067 --> 42:22.799
- least.
- Yeah.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.566
Like, you and I had
such a close relationship, and

42:25.567 --> 42:27.832
then for you just to, like,
disappear, that's, like...

42:27.833 --> 42:30.532
No, I wouldn't want to do that.

42:30.533 --> 42:32.699
And I would like to be there for
you.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.966
- Well, good.
- I just want everyone to

42:34.967 --> 42:38.499
be happy, so, you know, I need
everyone else to be, like, on

42:38.500 --> 42:41.933
the same page.
We'll get everyone together.

42:44.667 --> 42:47.499
It feels so good to
have my brother back and in my

42:47.500 --> 42:50.832
life.
Just... I feel so much more safe

42:50.833 --> 42:53.866
and just, like, at peace that he
is here and someone that I could

42:53.867 --> 42:56.599
talk to and call and lean on,
and just be that silly, goofy

42:56.600 --> 42:58.699
brother that I always have.
Me not talking to you for

42:58.700 --> 43:00.699
- months, that's weird.
- Yeah.

43:00.700 --> 43:04.166
Like, that's never
happened ever in my life before.

43:04.167 --> 43:08.299
Well...
I love you.

43:08.300 --> 43:11.466
I love you, too.

43:11.467 --> 43:14.699
- I'm really tired.
- Want to take a nap

43:14.700 --> 43:16.399
- together?
- Mm...

43:16.400 --> 43:18.899
Keeping up with

43:18.900 --> 43:21.132
- the Kardashians...
- I'm at the Women of

43:21.133 --> 43:24.266
the Year Awards.
I just can't get on the stage

43:24.267 --> 43:26.666
- and talk.
- What would be your

43:26.667 --> 43:29.199
dream birthday party that we
could all do to celebrate with

43:29.200 --> 43:31.032
- you?
- Why doesn't everyone

43:31.033 --> 43:33.266
just, like, call me and wish me
a happy birthday this year?

43:33.267 --> 43:35.666
- No.
- I'm so glad you

43:35.667 --> 43:38.132
invited... I was invited,
I was like, "Yay."

43:38.133 --> 43:41.499
- Hey, Rob. How's Chyna?
- Um, I'm out of her house

43:41.500 --> 43:44.832
and we're not living together.
