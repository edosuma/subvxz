WEBVTT

00:10.411 --> 00:11.543
It's bad.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.545
He can physically harm people.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.047
I think
it wants to hurt me.

00:16.050 --> 00:19.051
I have been scratched
on my arms recently.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.621
He caused many deaths.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.991
I think it wants to kill
whoever's just living here.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.762
Do you think this thing
killed Wayla's father?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.965
And he's laughing.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.801
And he's saying, "Ha-ha-ha.
Kind of sucks, doesn't it?"

00:37.772 --> 00:39.905
Panic, panic, panic.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.607
My name is Amy Allen.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.476
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.311
The house just feels bad.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.047
I see dead people.

00:49.049 --> 00:53.519
This man is completely insane.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.287
I speak to dead people...

00:56.490 --> 00:58.791
Okay she doesn't
like it in there.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.692
...and they speak to me.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.694
He likes to
twist that knife.

01:02.696 --> 01:06.231
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.901
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.403
I rely on my partner.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.771
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.840
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.908
Now, does he die
right there on the spot?

01:16.910 --> 01:20.813
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.415
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.883
It's my job to reveal them.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.419
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.221
But Steve and I never speak...

01:29.223 --> 01:31.323
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.824
...until the very end...

01:32.826 --> 01:34.292
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.962
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:36.964 --> 01:38.830
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.933
...or time to get out.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.035
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

01:57.051 --> 01:58.750
I'm in Bogalusa, Louisiana.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.785
It's about an hour
north of New Orleans.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.520
I got a call
from a woman named Wayla.

02:02.522 --> 02:05.991
Now, she thinks the dead in
her home killed her father.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.926
And if Amy and I can't find
a way to get rid of him,

02:07.928 --> 02:09.928
she thinks she's gonna be next.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.465
Before Amy arrives,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.834
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.671
This house has a lot
of family photographs

02:19.673 --> 02:20.739
and religious symbols,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.674
so it's important
that I remove them all.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.011
When I'm done, the
location will be ready

02:26.013 --> 02:27.346
for tonight's walk.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.526
The energy here is
always in motion.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.066
We can't be calm here.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.237
Lots of anxiety.
The stress, the anxiety.

02:52.239 --> 02:56.140
The dead, they say all
of these living people

02:56.142 --> 02:58.777
are the real problem here.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.518
So, Wayla,
I'm glad I'm here now.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.854
When we spoke on the phone,
you sounded pretty terrified.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.254
What's going on?

03:10.256 --> 03:13.592
The paranormal activity here
is out of control.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.127
Day to day life here
is a living hell.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.331
I'm scared for my family.
I'm scared for myself.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.266
I called you
because we need help.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.102
You seem like you're
scared right now.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.471
I mean I'm better
now that you're here.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.673
Okay.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.840
Who all lives in
the house with you?

03:28.842 --> 03:31.610
My husband, Hector,
my son, Kristian, and me.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.279
All right, so what type
of experiences

03:34.281 --> 03:35.547
are we talking about?

03:35.549 --> 03:39.217
Well, we're having everything
from banging noises

03:39.219 --> 03:40.852
to disembodies voices.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.955
We see black shadows...

03:43.957 --> 03:44.756
Okay.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.024
...and physical violence.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.827
I am suffering health issues.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.495
What kind of health issues
are we talking about?

03:50.497 --> 03:54.800
I am having debilitating
stomach pains,

03:54.802 --> 03:58.103
and my dad was having
these same type of pains

03:58.105 --> 03:59.638
right before he died.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.707
Okay, so when did
your father live here?

04:01.709 --> 04:05.711
He lived here from 1996
until his death in 2008.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.245
He died here in the home.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.081
His bedroom was
right over there,

04:09.083 --> 04:12.684
that first room right there,
and it's now my son's bedroom.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.119
How old was Dad?

04:14.121 --> 04:14.853
79.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.120
So, what makes you think

04:16.123 --> 04:18.190
his death was caused
by the paranormal?

04:18.192 --> 04:19.958
A few days before he died,

04:19.959 --> 04:22.728
he had been speaking
with some friends of his...
Okay.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.664
...and he told them that he was
seeing things in the house.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.499
So what do you think
happened?

04:27.501 --> 04:30.469
I think maybe this house
has something to do with it...
Okay.

04:30.471 --> 04:35.674
...and I think that it might
be coming after me, too.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.809
Why don't you just move?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.410
I can't afford it.

04:39.412 --> 04:43.681
Between your father passing and
the hell you're living through,

04:43.683 --> 04:45.583
how are you dealing
with all of this?

04:45.585 --> 04:46.885
Not very well.

04:46.887 --> 04:53.025
I'm constantly stressed
and totally scared all the time.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.626
It's not living.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.832
I'm seeing this thing that looks
like a shadowy stick figure.

05:00.834 --> 05:05.871
Super tall, super slender,
long arms, long legs.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.708
Not really much
of a torso area.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.209
They're seeing it there.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.780
And it hates.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.315
It hates.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.918
They feel this, they feel
it in their stomachs.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.253
They're scared.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.731
I think this thing
killed somebody here.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.235
It's a male.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.471
Already sick.

05:40.741 --> 05:45.010
I see this thing put its --
inside their mouth

05:45.012 --> 05:47.579
and into their throat.

05:47.581 --> 05:51.749
Then I see this person just,
like, shrivel up into dust.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.958
What's going on in here?

05:59.960 --> 06:03.395
There has been
a female apparition

06:03.397 --> 06:05.964
right here in front
of my son's door.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.466
Can you describe her
for me?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.568
50s, kind of
sandy blonde hair.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.670
See-through.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.870
Anything else?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.840
We see black shadows
here all the time.

06:15.842 --> 06:21.379
I've seen a black mist come up,
like, out of the floor.
Okay.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.917
And it just formed up
into a human shape.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.152
Any kind of mechanical
stuff down there?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.120
No. There's nothing
in that area

06:29.122 --> 06:31.923
that could have caused
black smoke to come up.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.658
So, I mean,
with all this going on,

06:33.660 --> 06:34.893
what do you think it is?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.362
These black shadows
are extremely scary.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.196
Maybe demonic.

06:41.701 --> 06:42.901
This person's freaking out

06:42.903 --> 06:45.904
because of this shadow
stick-figure thing.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.006
This thing is old.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.541
And it's angry.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.944
And it has a lot
of personalities.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.016
This thing is fully conscious.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.286
But it's made up of people.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.287
How?

07:02.289 --> 07:04.756
It's a PK manifestation.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.759
From a long, long time ago.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.996
A PK manifestation
develops from a poltergeist

07:10.998 --> 07:13.498
with consistent exposure
to living agents,

07:13.500 --> 07:17.569
suffering extreme stress,
trauma, and emotional upheaval.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.839
They're extremely powerful
and can physically interact

07:20.841 --> 07:22.507
with their environment.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.910
So there are some, like,
living people here

07:24.912 --> 07:28.312
who had a lot of anger
and hatred.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.182
They created this.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.585
Feels like it comes and goes
through this closet here.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.855
It comes out of here.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.858
It comes out of here,
but it goes up...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.963
...when it hides.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.803
What's going on?

07:52.805 --> 07:55.406
Well, one of the
biggest issues in here

07:55.408 --> 07:57.575
is my closet door.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.313
The door knob will turn,
and it'll open on its own.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.950
I mean,
these are old doors,

08:05.952 --> 08:07.685
I don't know
how paranormal that is.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.288
We've had some issues

08:10.290 --> 08:12.824
with seeing things
come out of the closet, too.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.792
Like what?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.126
Black shadows,
things like that.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.363
That's a different story,
then.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.865
I'm terrified
of that closet.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.100
So anything else?

08:22.102 --> 08:25.971
I have mood swings
that range anywhere

08:25.973 --> 08:28.506
from anger
to depression,

08:28.508 --> 08:31.376
anxiety, stress, fear,

08:31.378 --> 08:33.912
might just fly off
the handle for no reason.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.448
Okay, so you think that's all
to do with the paranormal?

08:37.451 --> 08:38.783
Or do you think it has
something to do with the fact

08:38.784 --> 08:40.585
you're under the stress
from the paranormal?

08:40.587 --> 08:43.520
I think that whatever
is in this house

08:43.523 --> 08:45.056
is influencing a lot.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.691
And they're also affecting
my son, Kristian.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.795
His mood has even
turned strange and dark.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.530
Okay, in what way?

08:52.532 --> 08:55.266
He's obsessed with death.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.434
He likes to scare me.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.170
We have fought
so many times.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.007
So it's not just
the paranormal problem,

09:02.009 --> 09:03.341
it's tearing
your family apart.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.609
Absolutely.

09:04.611 --> 09:05.743
Anything else?

09:05.745 --> 09:08.546
Yeah, actually
I have been scratched

09:08.548 --> 09:11.883
in multiple places
on my body.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.951
This is my chest.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.888
It feels like
a never-ending burn,

09:16.890 --> 09:18.289
like a frozen burn.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.425
I know you got a cat here
somewhere, right?

09:20.427 --> 09:21.659
Yes, I do have a cat.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.228
That is not
a cat scratch.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.230
Whatever's here, what do you
think it wants from you?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.664
I think it wants
to hurt me.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.766
But I can't do it
anymore.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.034
I can't.

09:30.036 --> 09:33.571
All I want is a happy,
healthy, normal life.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.710
I think
this shadow thing attacks.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.513
I see it fighting
with somebody on here.

09:41.515 --> 09:45.817
A person is trying to sleep.

09:47.354 --> 09:51.156
And this thing is, like,
right here on the collar bones.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.561
It definitely attacks
people where they're weak,

09:56.563 --> 10:01.466
it makes them sick from that,
and it brings out regret

10:01.468 --> 10:04.202
and it brings out hatred.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.404
It wants to kill living people.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.662
Well Hector, I was talking
to your wife, Wayla

10:30.664 --> 10:32.530
and she was saying that
whatever's in this house

10:32.532 --> 10:34.899
is dangerous to you
and your family?

10:34.901 --> 10:37.135
Have you ever experienced
anything you can't explain?

10:42.009 --> 10:45.210
Does the voice say anything
to you in particular?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.713
Anything else happen?

11:08.568 --> 11:11.436
These moods swings, are they
affecting your relationship?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.448
So, Hector, do you think
that whatever's in this house

11:23.450 --> 11:24.949
is dangerous to you
and your family?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.992
I'm seeing an old woman.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.527
She's dead.

11:36.529 --> 11:42.433
This angry, or rather
hate-filled woman cries a lot.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.336
So I think that the
living actually would hear

11:45.338 --> 11:50.642
a female crying and maybe hear
a female talking to herself.

11:50.644 --> 11:54.813
So she's an extremely
negative person.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.984
So they might feel negative
and ugly.

12:04.290 --> 12:08.493
The old woman comes in here,
and she's angry.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.431
She wants to hurt, physically.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.269
Anybody that comes in here,
it wants to hurt.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.105
It's bad.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.315
Monica, I understand
you're good friends with Wayla.
Yes.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.616
How long you guys
known each other?

12:32.618 --> 12:34.352
- About 10 years.
- Okay.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.055
I moved here for three months
to help Wayla.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.057
Did you ever experience
anything you couldn't explain?

12:39.059 --> 12:42.393
I seen what looked
like the Grim Reaper.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.928
Guy with the hood with
the sickle and all that?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.264
Yes, just looked at me
and stared at me

12:46.266 --> 12:48.533
with the black-pitch eyes.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.601
What do you think it was?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.669
It was not human.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.604
It was demonic.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.972
Okay, so anything else?

12:54.974 --> 12:58.009
I've been physically
attacked, several times.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.411
I was scratched on my arm,

13:00.413 --> 13:03.214
I was shoved
on my right shoulder

13:03.216 --> 13:06.384
and I had been slapped
on the bottom of the leg.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.487
I get scared to death
being here.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.689
Wayla's pretty convinced
that whatever's in this house

13:11.691 --> 13:13.891
may have killed her father,
and now it's going after her.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.960
Do you agree with that?
- Yes I do.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.830
Absolutely believe 100%.

13:18.832 --> 13:22.000
I think it wants to kill
whoever's just living here.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.501
Okay.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.311
There's one male
who stays here all the time.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.047
He's sitting down.
He's wearing a suit.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.317
He's old.
He makes me feel sick.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.386
And he's laughing.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.490
And he's saying, "Ha-ha-ha.
Kind of sucks, doesn't it?"

13:47.493 --> 13:51.562
I think he can physically
harm people, and he does.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.568
And what kind of
physical stuff would he do?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.971
He says anything that
his heart desires.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.408
The children are
being strangled.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.784
So, Kristian,
how old are you?

14:12.786 --> 14:13.884
I'm 15.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.286
15, okay.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.788
So, I was talking
to Mom earlier,

14:16.790 --> 14:18.389
and she was saying
how she feels

14:18.391 --> 14:21.158
it's dangerous
in this house for you guys.
Yes.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.262
I understand you guys have
been physically attacked.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.431
I have been scratched
on my arms recently.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.166
- Okay.
- Here's a photo.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.839
All right, did you feel
anything scratch you?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.707
I didn't feel
a single thing.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.976
Okay, anything else?

14:37.978 --> 14:40.511
I was sitting in the room
watching TV.

14:40.513 --> 14:44.482
I looked over
and I saw a man in black

14:44.484 --> 14:47.352
walking around
my mom's bedroom.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.253
I immediately went
into my mom's room

14:49.255 --> 14:51.455
and I asked,
"Mama who's up in here?"

14:51.457 --> 14:53.124
And she said, "Nobody."

14:54.660 --> 14:56.461
Your mom tells me
you're scaring her

14:56.463 --> 14:57.929
and giving her
a hard time.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.030
What's up with that?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.898
It was just for
a harmless little prank.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.333
You should stop doing it,
though,

15:02.335 --> 15:03.935
'cause your mom doesn't need
the aggravation.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.469
She's got enough
on her mind.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.538
She doesn't want anything bad
to happen to you.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.807
Okay?
Appreciate that.

15:09.809 --> 15:10.808
Okay.

15:14.146 --> 15:17.482
This old man, he makes
living people delusional.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.985
I think he can manipulate them
and their emotions.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.990
I think that he
can influence them.

15:25.992 --> 15:30.861
Now it says, "Shh, shh, you're
giving all my secrets away."

15:36.702 --> 15:41.238
A lot of the directed, I think
to this, whoever this is.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.876
I think that the old man
can jump this person.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.382
He's saying something
about taking over a boy.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.151
He's a very sick person --
very sick.

16:08.517 --> 16:11.252
So I made my usual calls,
and get this.

16:11.254 --> 16:13.054
One of the historians
I reached out to

16:13.056 --> 16:15.656
is actually a descendant
of one of the first owners

16:15.658 --> 16:16.957
of Wayla's property.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.460
Turns out his family was
involved in a brutal homicide

16:19.462 --> 16:20.695
back in the 1890s.

16:20.697 --> 16:21.862
I'm heading over
to meet this guy

16:21.864 --> 16:23.798
and find out
exactly what happened.

16:29.372 --> 16:31.371
So, Bill, I appreciate
you meeting with me.

16:31.373 --> 16:34.074
Now, I know you were a
relative of the Williams family

16:34.076 --> 16:36.377
that actually owned my
client's property at one time.

16:36.379 --> 16:37.979
What can you tell me
about them?

16:37.981 --> 16:41.682
Your client's property was
owned by Martin Williams,

16:41.684 --> 16:45.686
but in my family we grew up
knowing him as Captain Martin.

16:45.688 --> 16:48.522
Captain, where'd he get from?
The army or something?

16:48.524 --> 16:52.126
Yes, he served as a Captain
in the Confederate Army.

16:52.128 --> 16:53.361
There's a photograph.

16:53.363 --> 16:55.997
He was in many battles,
and he eventually

16:55.999 --> 16:59.800
made his way back
to Bogalusa in 1865.

16:59.802 --> 17:01.235
What's the story
with this homicide?

17:01.237 --> 17:06.973
Well, in November 1894,
his son A.C. Williams

17:06.976 --> 17:10.411
got in a argument with another
gentleman, Chris Morris.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.378
Now, instead of picking
a fight with Morris,

17:12.381 --> 17:14.013
he just went home
and told his father.

17:14.016 --> 17:15.182
All right,
so how old was A.C.?

17:15.184 --> 17:16.050
28 years old.

17:16.051 --> 17:17.785
Okay, so he's not a kid.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.086
No.

17:19.088 --> 17:20.387
And he came back
and told his daddy

17:20.390 --> 17:21.321
that somebody
insulted him.

17:21.324 --> 17:22.522
Yes, yes.

17:22.525 --> 17:23.858
Do you know anything
about this kid, Morris?

17:23.859 --> 17:25.893
He was a larger black man.

17:25.895 --> 17:28.663
We can speculate that
he was in his late 20s.

17:28.665 --> 17:31.198
Okay, so around
the same age as A.C.
Yes.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.536
His father Martin immediately
heads out to find Chris Morris

17:35.538 --> 17:38.906
and he runs into his
father, Kelsey Morris.

17:38.908 --> 17:42.042
He asks him to come along
and help find his son, Chris,

17:42.044 --> 17:45.146
and Kelsey said no.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.280
All right,
so what happens next?

17:46.282 --> 17:47.882
Martin was infuriated

17:47.884 --> 17:50.752
and pulled out his rifle
and shot him dead.

17:51.955 --> 17:54.055
And here's an article
about the shooting.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.490
Did he get arrested
for it?

17:56.492 --> 18:00.261
He was arrested.
There was a trial a week later.

18:00.263 --> 18:06.233
His defense team eventually
pleas that he was insane.

18:06.235 --> 18:07.435
Does the jury buy that?

18:07.437 --> 18:09.002
They actually do,

18:09.004 --> 18:12.673
and Martin was acquitted,
as you'll see right here,

18:12.675 --> 18:15.443
and he never served
any time for the homicide.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.845
That's a shame.

18:21.784 --> 18:24.651
This guy in the suit
is a big problem.

18:24.653 --> 18:27.988
Can you tell anything
about this guy in life?

18:27.990 --> 18:29.223
He's white.

18:29.225 --> 18:31.291
He's old, he's bald.

18:31.293 --> 18:34.161
He was wealthy.
He was a tyrant.

18:34.163 --> 18:38.999
- Can you tell when he's from?
- I get 1878.

18:39.001 --> 18:40.067
Do you have any idea

18:40.069 --> 18:41.602
if he has any connection
to the property?

18:41.604 --> 18:44.572
He owned this land
at some point.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.609
I think this man
killed a lot of people.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.480
With this guy, it's bad.
I don't like him.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.918
So far, I've got a client

18:57.920 --> 19:00.488
who believes paranormal activity
killed her father

19:00.490 --> 19:03.090
on a property where
one of the previous owners

19:03.092 --> 19:05.193
murdered a man in cold blood.

19:05.195 --> 19:08.162
But I want to see if
there's anything else.

19:08.164 --> 19:10.698
Searching through old
records, I come across a story

19:10.700 --> 19:12.166
about a local lumber mill.

19:12.168 --> 19:15.035
Turns out, it was the
sight of a deadly riot

19:15.037 --> 19:18.005
less than a mile
from Wayla's house.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.541
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

19:20.543 --> 19:23.043
who says this was a tragedy
that started with greed

19:23.045 --> 19:24.779
and ended in bloodshed.

19:31.554 --> 19:33.020
What can you tell me
about this lumber mill?

19:33.022 --> 19:36.123
Basically every single
thing in the community

19:36.125 --> 19:37.859
is directly connected
to the mill.

19:37.861 --> 19:40.994
The people that run the mill
also run the town,

19:40.996 --> 19:43.263
they set wages, you know,
they hire and fire,

19:43.265 --> 19:45.299
they do everything there.
- Okay, so it sounds like

19:45.301 --> 19:47.902
the guys that own and ran
this mill had a lot of juice.

19:47.904 --> 19:50.037
They have all the juice.

19:50.039 --> 19:52.006
So how did it, you know,
fester into a riot?

19:52.008 --> 19:54.008
Several different
people in the community

19:54.010 --> 19:56.710
begin to talk about
organizing a union,

19:56.712 --> 19:58.212
but what they begin
to notice is,

19:58.214 --> 20:01.215
that these are all white people
working together,

20:01.217 --> 20:03.818
and 50% of the labor
at the mill is black.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.787
And hence arrived
a man named Sol Dacus.

20:06.789 --> 20:10.091
And his purpose is going
to be to help unionize

20:10.093 --> 20:13.160
the black laborers in
a cooperative endeavor

20:13.162 --> 20:14.694
with white laborers,

20:14.696 --> 20:16.697
which is almost unprecedented
in southern history.

20:16.699 --> 20:19.566
I mean this had to piss off the
powers that be and the bosses.

20:19.568 --> 20:21.501
They go bananas
about this.

20:21.503 --> 20:24.705
And so they create
the special police force

20:24.707 --> 20:27.307
to smash this
unionization attempt.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.109
So what do they do?

20:28.111 --> 20:29.710
First target is Sol Dacus.

20:29.712 --> 20:31.011
Okay.

20:31.013 --> 20:33.914
So this is
November 21, 1919.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.884
Some say as many as 100
of these special police,

20:36.886 --> 20:38.819
they're gonna go after him
at his house.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.754
He managed to get out of the
house before they got there

20:40.756 --> 20:42.189
and was hiding
in the swamps.

20:42.191 --> 20:43.590
So they trash his place.

20:43.592 --> 20:45.726
So the next morning,
the union people

20:45.728 --> 20:48.562
make a determined statement
of their own.

20:48.564 --> 20:50.531
And what they're gonna do,
is they're gonna send

20:50.533 --> 20:54.267
two white union organizers
with Sol Dacus

20:54.269 --> 20:56.337
and they're gonna
walk up and down

20:56.339 --> 20:57.772
the main street
of Bogalusa.

20:57.774 --> 21:01.142
Both of the white men were armed
with shotguns in their hands.

21:01.144 --> 21:02.943
"We are not going
to be intimidated.

21:02.945 --> 21:04.745
We are not backing down
this time."

21:04.747 --> 21:06.413
Now, how far,
approximately, is that

21:06.415 --> 21:07.581
from my client's
property?

21:07.583 --> 21:08.682
About 3,000 feet.

21:08.684 --> 21:09.750
Okay,
so it's pretty close.

21:09.752 --> 21:10.951
Very close.

21:10.953 --> 21:12.285
I'm sure management
got word of this,

21:12.287 --> 21:15.089
and got pissed off and had
to retaliate at some point.

21:15.091 --> 21:18.359
In the end, it turns into
a full pitched battle.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.695
Dozens and dozens
of shots are fired.

21:20.697 --> 21:21.762
What's the body count?

21:21.764 --> 21:23.297
Once the hail of bullets
stopped,

21:23.299 --> 21:26.633
you've got three white union
organizers killed outright.

21:26.635 --> 21:29.937
A fourth one will die
about 48 hours later.

21:29.939 --> 21:33.140
But, they bought time
for Sol Dacus

21:33.142 --> 21:35.942
to escape out the back
and get away into the woods.

21:35.944 --> 21:38.178
- Sol gets away again.
- Gets away again.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.380
This guy's lucky.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.315
All right, so we got
four homicides here.

21:41.317 --> 21:42.783
Did anybody get
arrested for this?

21:42.785 --> 21:45.653
13 members of the special police
were arrested,

21:45.655 --> 21:47.788
but later a grand jury
refused to indict.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.290
And, in fact, they
were only in jail

21:49.292 --> 21:50.758
for about
an hour and a half.

21:55.431 --> 21:57.732
There are a bunch of
dead people right here.

22:00.169 --> 22:02.602
That's a lot of them.

22:02.604 --> 22:03.537
How many?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.739
Maybe 10 to 15.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.942
It looks like it's outside.

22:07.944 --> 22:11.278
There's at least three or four
people that were murdered.

22:13.316 --> 22:16.884
I see one of them
being shot in the head

22:16.886 --> 22:21.789
with an old fashioned gun,
outside.

22:24.794 --> 22:27.294
They're all in a panic,
they're all freaking out.

22:27.296 --> 22:29.296
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

22:29.298 --> 22:32.266
My head, my head.
It feels like it's exploding.

22:43.479 --> 22:45.913

23:04.867 --> 23:07.902
So a retired Bogalusa
police chief just called.

23:09.105 --> 23:10.671
He went digging through
some files for me

23:10.673 --> 23:13.040
and says he found a cold
blooded murder pretty close

23:13.042 --> 23:14.341
to my client's property

23:14.343 --> 23:16.110
that I'll definitely
need to know about.

23:22.919 --> 23:25.386
So, Chief, thanks for helping
me out with this case of mine.

23:25.388 --> 23:27.455
So what were you
able to find out?

23:27.457 --> 23:30.391
Well, the Furrs.

23:30.393 --> 23:34.428
Mamie and Will live in
Old Main Street in Bogalusa.

23:34.430 --> 23:37.198
Cola Lemming is living
next door.
Okay.

23:37.200 --> 23:41.301
January of 1949, Cola Lemming
invites Ms. Furr over

23:41.303 --> 23:45.139
for a cup of coffee that turns
out to be her last cup ever.

23:45.141 --> 23:46.807
Okay, what happened?

23:46.809 --> 23:48.542
Almost immediately
upon returning

23:48.544 --> 23:51.945
to her house next door,
Ms. Furr was in such distress,

23:51.947 --> 23:53.480
screaming and throwing up
and whatever,

23:53.482 --> 23:55.382
that she attracted attention
of neighbors

23:55.384 --> 23:58.285
who came to her aid
and hauled her to the hospital,

23:58.287 --> 24:00.788
where we was pronounced dead
in pretty short order.

24:02.291 --> 24:06.327
The coroner was able to
rule her death as a homicide

24:06.329 --> 24:08.629
and the cause of death
as fluoride poisoning.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.433
How'd the cops put it together
that the neighbor

24:12.435 --> 24:13.968
had something to do
with this?

24:13.970 --> 24:15.503
They were able to go
back to that house

24:15.505 --> 24:19.974
and find a table cloth that
was stained with coffee...
Okay.

24:19.976 --> 24:21.308
...which, when tested,

24:21.310 --> 24:24.178
matched the same fluoride
poisoning from Ms. Furr.

24:25.081 --> 24:26.380
That's pretty good
police work.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.582
Did they ever
determine a motive?

24:28.584 --> 24:31.118
The main motive
behind the killing

24:31.120 --> 24:34.454
was the fact that Ms. Lemming
was having an affair

24:34.456 --> 24:36.990
with Ms. Furr's husband,
Will,

24:36.992 --> 24:40.594
and had been going on
for quite some time.

24:40.596 --> 24:41.928
So the dead woman's husband

24:41.930 --> 24:43.797
was having an affair
with this one?

24:43.799 --> 24:44.765
Yes.

24:44.767 --> 24:46.600
Okay.

24:46.602 --> 24:50.070
And she was arrested
and tried and convicted

24:50.072 --> 24:52.006
to life in prison
by the judge.

24:52.008 --> 24:53.507
Here's a copy
of the order

24:53.509 --> 24:55.409
where he sent her
to Angola Penitentiary.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.177
Okay, so I assume
she dies in prison.

24:57.179 --> 24:58.412
No, she does not.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.848
About 10 years into
this life sentence,

25:00.850 --> 25:03.884
the governor issued a governor's
pardon and let her out.

25:03.886 --> 25:06.620
Now, what the circumstances were
around that recommendation,

25:06.622 --> 25:07.488
I mean, who knows?

25:07.490 --> 25:09.022
Now, does she ever show

25:09.024 --> 25:11.124
any signs of remorse
for killing her neighbor?

25:11.126 --> 25:13.560
No, she maintained her
innocence till the end.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.437
That angry woman
keeps following me.

25:24.774 --> 25:27.007
Can you tell anything
about her in life?

25:27.009 --> 25:29.043
I see a short
full-figured woman.

25:29.045 --> 25:33.314
Short brown hair, sometimes
glasses, in her 40s or 50s.

25:33.316 --> 25:35.182
Angry all the time.

25:35.184 --> 25:38.618
Getting heart issues
due to extreme stress.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.722
She will not accept
responsibility for her actions.

25:46.729 --> 25:48.195
She's crying in here.

25:49.832 --> 25:52.466
Any idea
what period she's from?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.401
Possibly in the '30s?

25:54.403 --> 25:56.170
She's in a panic.
She's freaking out.

25:56.172 --> 25:57.938
Something horrible happened.

25:57.940 --> 26:02.076
Nobody's listening to her.
Nobody's listening to her.

26:02.078 --> 26:04.911
She's screaming,
"She's dead! She's dead!"

26:15.891 --> 26:18.492
I saw several disturbing things
during my walk,

26:18.494 --> 26:22.095
but the old man in the suit
had me very concerned.

26:22.097 --> 26:25.098
He was probably in his
late 70s, early 80s.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.101
He didn't have
any eyebrows.

26:27.103 --> 26:30.337
He could be, like,
grimacing or something.

26:33.376 --> 26:35.642
He had bad dentures.

26:45.921 --> 26:47.421
Amy,
is this who you saw?

26:48.857 --> 26:49.823
Yes.

27:09.812 --> 27:12.746
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:12.748 --> 27:15.182
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:15.184 --> 27:17.284
and our clients
for the first time.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.654
So, Amy, I'd like
you to meet Wayla.

27:20.656 --> 27:22.889
She lives here with
her husband, Hector

27:22.891 --> 27:25.225
and her 15-year-old son,
Kristian.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.960
Here's a photo
of them right here.

27:28.163 --> 27:29.563
Hector doesn't speak
a lot of English,

27:29.565 --> 27:31.799
so I've asked Monica,
who's Wayla's friend

27:31.801 --> 27:34.167
to sit in for him.

27:34.169 --> 27:36.336
Now, Monica actually
moved in here

27:36.338 --> 27:37.504
for a few months

27:37.506 --> 27:40.507
to take care of Wayla
when she was sick.

27:40.509 --> 27:41.975
Both these ladies
are convinced

27:41.977 --> 27:44.044
the paranormal activity
here is dangerous,

27:44.046 --> 27:45.912
and if we can't find
a way to stop it,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.881
somebody's gonna die.

27:47.883 --> 27:50.717
So now that Amy
knows your situation,

27:50.719 --> 27:52.786
I'll ask her to
describe her walk.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.459
I encountered
a negative female.

27:58.461 --> 28:00.527
When you encounter
her energy,

28:00.529 --> 28:03.663
you just start to feel
this gross,

28:03.665 --> 28:07.935
disgusting kind of churning
in your stomach,

28:07.937 --> 28:11.338
and then things that normally
wouldn't really bother you

28:11.340 --> 28:15.142
become extremely
gross and nasty.

28:15.144 --> 28:17.411
Now, Amy, you're describing
one of the main reasons

28:17.413 --> 28:19.346
that Wayla called us in.

28:19.348 --> 28:24.351
I experience rapid
mood swings, depression.

28:24.353 --> 28:26.286
I might've had a good day,

28:26.288 --> 28:28.221
and then all of a sudden
my husband comes in,

28:28.223 --> 28:32.092
and for no reason at all,
holler at him.

28:32.094 --> 28:33.827
Now, Monica, when you
was living back there,

28:33.829 --> 28:35.562
did you get any
of those feelings?

28:35.564 --> 28:37.965
Yes, me and my husband
arguing and fighting,

28:37.967 --> 28:39.466
on a constant basis,

28:39.468 --> 28:42.369
like I was gonna
snap in an instant.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.439
These mood swings and
the fighting and the negativity

28:45.441 --> 28:47.907
is coming from this woman?
- Yep.

28:47.909 --> 28:49.376
Did you get anything
on who this woman

28:49.378 --> 28:50.710
might've been in life?

28:50.712 --> 28:55.549
The woman that I saw was
short and full-figured.

28:55.551 --> 28:58.385
She looked like she was
in her 40s, maybe 50s.

28:58.387 --> 29:01.254
Brown hair, sometimes
wore glasses.

29:01.256 --> 29:03.523
Wayla, didn't you see
a female apparition?

29:03.525 --> 29:08.061
Yes, a female, no more than 40,
in, like, a white lace dress.

29:08.063 --> 29:09.430
Interesting.

29:09.432 --> 29:12.666
She was extremely full
of hatred and misery.

29:12.668 --> 29:16.003
I was getting heart issues
with her because of her stress.

29:16.005 --> 29:19.206
This stress then clouds her
judgment and her reasoning.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.541
And the big thing that
stood out about her

29:21.543 --> 29:24.878
was that she absolutely
cannot accept responsibility

29:24.880 --> 29:27.881
for her decisions
and actions.

29:27.883 --> 29:29.683
A woman full of hate, misery,
bad judgment --

29:29.685 --> 29:31.150
probably a long shot,

29:31.152 --> 29:33.553
but I'll tell you about a murder
I came across in my research.

29:33.555 --> 29:35.688
It involved two women who
lived next door to each other,

29:35.690 --> 29:37.357
about a mile from here.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.025
In January of 1949,

29:39.027 --> 29:41.094
a 43-year-old woman
named Cola Lemming

29:41.096 --> 29:43.429
invited her next door
neighbor, Mamie Furr,

29:43.431 --> 29:44.898
over for a cup of coffee.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.900
Right after Mamie
drank the coffee,

29:46.902 --> 29:48.902
she went home and
started vomiting blood.

29:48.904 --> 29:50.137
My gosh!

29:51.206 --> 29:52.472
The coroner figured out

29:52.474 --> 29:54.507
that she had died of
fluoride poisoning

29:54.509 --> 29:55.843
and ruled it a homicide.

29:57.112 --> 30:00.113
Got a copy of Mamie's
death certificate here.

30:00.115 --> 30:01.915
So what was the motive
for this murder?

30:01.917 --> 30:03.784
It was a classic love triangle.

30:03.786 --> 30:06.452
Lemming was having an affair
with Furr's husband.

30:06.454 --> 30:09.856
I was able to get an article
after Lemming's arrest.

30:09.858 --> 30:12.526
Her photo kind of reminds
me of how you described her.

30:13.595 --> 30:16.797
She was convicted of the murder
and sentenced to life in prison.

30:18.267 --> 30:21.801
Now, somehow, she winds up
getting a pardon 10 years later.

30:21.803 --> 30:23.803
Why she got pardoned
is still a mystery,

30:23.805 --> 30:26.473
but she never admitted
to killing her.

30:26.475 --> 30:28.308
Wow.

30:31.013 --> 30:35.982
The other individual
that I encountered was a trip.

30:35.984 --> 30:39.152
This is one
of the more intense

30:39.154 --> 30:42.255
and powerful
deceased individuals.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.290
it's a male.

30:43.292 --> 30:45.558
The initial flash
I got of him,

30:45.560 --> 30:48.562
the way he presented
initially was like in his 40s.

30:48.564 --> 30:52.832
But majority of the time
I was dealing with him,

30:52.834 --> 30:57.871
he was presenting as much older,
like 70s, possibly 80s.

30:57.873 --> 30:59.439
He was white and bald.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.174
I felt like
he owned the property

31:01.176 --> 31:04.678
at some point, but not
necessarily this house.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.813
Possibly in the 1870s.

31:08.717 --> 31:11.117
This guy was wealthy,
wore nice suits,

31:11.119 --> 31:15.322
but he was, and is,
an absolute tyrant.

31:15.324 --> 31:17.724
I believe he caused
quite a few deaths

31:17.726 --> 31:19.059
while he was alive.

31:20.195 --> 31:21.561
A lot of things you're saying
make me think

31:21.563 --> 31:23.397
of one of the earliest owners
of your property.

31:23.399 --> 31:24.798
His name was
Captain Martin Williams

31:24.800 --> 31:27.067
and he was born in town
back in 1838.

31:27.069 --> 31:29.736
So you said he caused a lot
of deaths while he was alive.

31:29.738 --> 31:31.672
Well, Williams did fight
for the Confederacy

31:31.674 --> 31:33.740
during the Civil War.

31:33.742 --> 31:36.009
Safe to say he had his
hand in a lot of deaths.

31:36.011 --> 31:37.744
When he came home
after the war,

31:37.746 --> 31:39.479
he became a wealthy farmer
and merchant,

31:39.481 --> 31:41.281
but the killing
didn't stop.

31:41.283 --> 31:45.218
Williams actually murdered a man
in town in 1894.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.919
This is how it went down.

31:46.921 --> 31:49.856
The Captain's son was
insulted by a black guy.

31:49.858 --> 31:51.557
So Captain William
took it upon himself

31:51.559 --> 31:54.161
to take a rifle
and go look for the guy.

31:55.297 --> 31:58.097
He comes across
the black guy's father,

31:58.099 --> 32:02.168
and he basically demands
that he takes him to his son.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.171
So like any father would do,
he refused.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.373
Williams freaked out
and got enraged

32:07.375 --> 32:09.442
at the fact that a black man
didn't listen

32:09.444 --> 32:11.044
to what he told him to do.

32:11.046 --> 32:12.512
And he shot him and killed
him right there on the spot.

32:12.514 --> 32:13.780
Wow.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.517
I talked to
a distant cousin of his,

32:17.519 --> 32:19.586
and he gave me
a photo of him.

32:19.588 --> 32:20.354
Wow.

32:21.590 --> 32:24.257
I've seen him.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.930
So, Amy, you think
you saw the Captain?

32:29.932 --> 32:33.066
I did have a sketch done
of the person that I saw.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.937
Ew.

32:37.939 --> 32:38.972
Creepy-looking guy.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.312
God.

32:50.085 --> 32:51.385
That's bothersome.

32:53.155 --> 32:54.421
He's scary.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.794
You think
it's Captain Williams, then?

33:00.796 --> 33:02.729
Yes.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.564
So I take it he doesn't
really look like that,

33:04.566 --> 33:06.433
and that's the way
he showed himself to you.

33:08.003 --> 33:09.903
And he knew
that people hated it,

33:09.905 --> 33:12.606
but he would do it anyways
just to freak them out.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.642
Would they have experiences
this with this guy?

33:15.644 --> 33:16.910
Yeah.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.312
You do not want to
encounter this man.

33:21.049 --> 33:23.249
First, I think
you might see him.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.785
So now, Monica,
you actually saw

33:24.787 --> 33:26.686
what you thought
was a Grim Reaper?

33:26.688 --> 33:29.122
Yes, I was going
into Wayla's bedroom

33:29.124 --> 33:31.324
and there was this
white pale face

33:31.326 --> 33:34.861
with black eyes
and a hooded figure

33:34.863 --> 33:37.797
and he was looking
straight dead at me eyes.

33:37.799 --> 33:39.899
That'd be
right up his alley.

33:39.901 --> 33:41.468
Now, can this guy
do anything else?

33:41.470 --> 33:43.870
I got that he could
make living people sick,

33:43.872 --> 33:46.506
but I wasn't
exactly sure how.

33:46.508 --> 33:49.142
He can get really physical
with the living.

33:49.144 --> 33:51.110
I think he could probably
hit you, push you,

33:51.112 --> 33:53.947
scratch you,
things like that.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.215
You and your son,
Kristian --

33:56.217 --> 33:57.884
tell her about
the scratches he's got.

33:57.886 --> 34:00.553
The other day,
he got a scratch

34:00.555 --> 34:02.622
that was kind of
a lightning bolt

34:02.624 --> 34:05.091
on I believe it
was the left arm.

34:05.093 --> 34:06.259
I got a photo of it.

34:09.164 --> 34:11.264
Now, Wayla, you've been
scratched, as well.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.398
Yes, I have.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.000
I got a photo of that, too.

34:15.804 --> 34:17.304
Wow.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.438
The scratches,
stuff like that.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.974
Is that being caused
by this Captain?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.042
Yeah.

34:23.110 --> 34:24.710
Did you get anything else
on this guy?

34:24.713 --> 34:27.413
He's extremely active
in the bedroom

34:27.415 --> 34:29.181
in the front
of the house.

34:29.184 --> 34:31.451
That's Kristian's bedroom.

34:31.453 --> 34:33.652
It was --
was my father's.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.654
****

34:34.656 --> 34:37.790
He can physically harm people,
and he does.

34:40.262 --> 34:43.663
And what kind of
physical stuff would he do?

34:43.665 --> 34:46.433
He says anything that
his heart desires.

34:46.435 --> 34:48.868
The most concerning
thing right now

34:48.870 --> 34:51.204
is that he indicated
that he could jump

34:51.206 --> 34:53.507
the person that's
in that room now.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.778
So I believe the individual
in there is a medium.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.347
This person
would be vulnerable

35:00.349 --> 35:04.217
to that specific kind of attack
from a dead person.

35:04.219 --> 35:08.421
So basically he's inhabiting
that individual's body.

35:08.423 --> 35:11.958
This can cause
all kinds of issues.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.662
He can cause him to behave
and speak differently.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.367
I almost don't recognize
my son anymore.

35:21.436 --> 35:25.137
He has been acting out.
His attitude has changed.

35:25.139 --> 35:28.274
He's obsessed with death
and the Grim Reaper.

35:28.276 --> 35:29.775
Wow.

35:29.777 --> 35:33.112
I'm curious about what
you think about Kristian

35:33.114 --> 35:34.881
possibly being a medium?

35:34.883 --> 35:37.283
Well,
to be honest with you,

35:37.285 --> 35:38.985
I'm not sure that
that would surprise me

35:38.987 --> 35:43.656
because he's always seen
things that we couldn't see.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.925
You know, him being a medium
is gonna draw

35:45.927 --> 35:47.760
a lot of dead in.

35:47.762 --> 35:50.363
There's gonna be
more activity in your house.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.665
The other thing is, is that
when this guy's jumping him,

35:52.667 --> 35:55.067
he's taking over
your son's body.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.203
God.

36:00.275 --> 36:03.276
There's this other thing
that really freaked me out.

36:03.278 --> 36:07.981
It's a PK Manifestation,
okay?

36:07.983 --> 36:12.552
A long time ago, some
**** up people lived here --

36:12.554 --> 36:13.753
living people.

36:13.755 --> 36:17.190
And they also had abilities.

36:17.192 --> 36:20.026
Their abilities
were psychokinesis,

36:20.028 --> 36:21.962
meaning that they could
influence the environment

36:21.964 --> 36:25.498
around them without
touching anything.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.167
Through doing things
like that,

36:27.169 --> 36:29.236
they ended up
creating an entity.

36:30.338 --> 36:32.305
This thing is created
from hate, fear,

36:32.307 --> 36:34.507
anger, regret,
sadness, and despair.

36:34.509 --> 36:37.576
And even now, when the
living have those kinds

36:37.578 --> 36:44.016
of emotions or thoughts,
it's absorbing from you.

36:44.018 --> 36:45.285
Okay, so what's this
thing look like?

36:45.287 --> 36:46.585
What it looked like
initially

36:46.587 --> 36:50.590
was this really tall,
almost stick figure,

36:50.592 --> 36:52.726
with, like,
this black stuff

36:52.728 --> 36:55.861
emanating off of its
little limbs.

36:55.863 --> 36:57.130
All right, so what
could this thing do

36:57.132 --> 36:58.598
to Wayla and her family?

36:59.301 --> 37:05.171
I saw it going in and out
of the closet in this room.

37:05.173 --> 37:07.040
That's Wayla's bedroom.

37:07.042 --> 37:08.941
Last night,
my closet opened

37:08.943 --> 37:12.011
and it just kind of
waffled back and forth.

37:12.013 --> 37:14.848
A lot of things seem to
come out of that closet.

37:14.850 --> 37:18.251
Wow. The other big thing
is that it emanates

37:18.253 --> 37:20.287
a lot of anxiety,
and that's because

37:20.289 --> 37:21.821
it's so negative and
chaotic,

37:21.823 --> 37:24.557
it also could make you feel
stressed out.

37:24.559 --> 37:28.494
I think it would be
impossible to be calm here.

37:28.496 --> 37:33.700
And I did get that it had
in fact killed someone here.

37:36.637 --> 37:38.438
My dad actually died
here in the house.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.974
****

37:40.976 --> 37:43.275
Here's a picture
of her father.

37:44.379 --> 37:47.714
My dad was in good health,
but he told some of his friends

37:47.716 --> 37:52.518
that he was having
stomach pains

37:52.520 --> 37:56.222
and that he was beginning
to see things in the house.

37:56.224 --> 37:58.624
I mean, do you think this thing
killed Wayla's father?

37:58.626 --> 38:01.528
Yeah it's...
Yeah.

38:01.530 --> 38:05.131
And I think it's trying to
bother some of the rest of us.

38:05.133 --> 38:06.933
Bother you? Come on.

38:06.935 --> 38:08.467
This is serious stuff
we're talking about.

38:08.469 --> 38:10.804
It's not gonna help things
by you tip-toeing around it.

38:10.806 --> 38:12.271
You thought whatever was
here killed your father.

38:12.273 --> 38:14.774
She just told you that
whatever was here did do that.

38:14.776 --> 38:16.776
I want to know,
but I don't want to know

38:16.778 --> 38:18.778
that this thing
killed my father.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.180
You know, it's scary.
It's really scary.

38:38.133 --> 38:39.999
So Wayla it's a good thing
you called us in when you did,

38:40.001 --> 38:42.334
because based on what
Amy's told us tonight,

38:42.336 --> 38:44.504
the situation here is
even more dangerous

38:44.506 --> 38:45.338
than you realized.

38:46.708 --> 38:49.075
Now's the time to
answer the big question.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.777
Can you live here safely,

38:50.779 --> 38:52.478
or do you need to get
everybody out of here

38:52.480 --> 38:55.615
before this thing takes
somebody else's life?

38:55.617 --> 38:57.617
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:00.855 --> 39:04.190
Very sorry
to have to tell you

39:04.192 --> 39:10.797
that the best thing you could
do, absolutely, is move.

39:10.799 --> 39:14.868
But, during your time here,
there's a few things you can do.

39:14.870 --> 39:17.737
Your son should see
a demonologist

39:17.739 --> 39:21.174
and a Reiki master/psychic.

39:21.176 --> 39:25.078
These two people
are going to remove

39:25.080 --> 39:29.749
any and all attachments
that he may have

39:29.751 --> 39:33.652
and also reclaim pieces
of his personality

39:33.654 --> 39:38.658
that may have become
dislocated.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.059
Once all that's
taken care of,

39:40.061 --> 39:43.129
that's when your son
should start

39:43.131 --> 39:46.532
to actively learn various
protection techniques

39:46.534 --> 39:47.667
for himself.

39:47.669 --> 39:49.602
One thing that I
am gonna suggest

39:49.604 --> 39:51.604
is that you see
a psychiatrist

39:51.606 --> 39:54.240
and a psychotherapist
for him -- now.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.610
So we know Wayla's
got to get out of here

39:57.612 --> 39:59.212
with the family,
but is there anybody

39:59.214 --> 40:01.314
that can come in
and fix this house?

40:01.316 --> 40:02.916
No.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.319
And it sucks.

40:07.589 --> 40:10.156
If she decides to stay,
what could happen?

40:10.158 --> 40:16.529
I mean we're looking at
a very, very bad situation

40:16.531 --> 40:19.432
and a very bad end
if you were to stay here.

40:20.902 --> 40:23.236
It's already killed.

40:23.238 --> 40:30.509
The possibility
of the entity killing again

40:30.511 --> 40:32.645
absolutely could happen.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.247
It's not easy for
Amy to tell people

40:34.249 --> 40:35.949
they got to get the
hell out of their house.

40:35.951 --> 40:39.719
What are you thinking as
far as what you're gonna do?

40:39.721 --> 40:41.488
Well, I don't know.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.256
Your dad
wouldn't want you here.

40:44.258 --> 40:45.458
I don't want you here.

40:45.460 --> 40:48.561
I've been begging for years,
so maybe this is a wake up.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.066
You're right.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.435
If you decide
to get out of here,

40:55.437 --> 40:56.836
which I hope you will,
are you gonna do

40:56.838 --> 40:58.805
all the other stuff
Amy's talking about?

40:58.807 --> 41:00.206
Absolutely, yes.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.809
I'm not willing to risk my son.
In fact, he is my world.

41:03.811 --> 41:06.078
Now I have the answers.
Now I know what to do.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.882
Now I know I have to leave.
There's no question.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.152
It's a new start,
just look at it that way.

41:13.754 --> 41:14.821
It's time.

41:14.823 --> 41:17.890
I really appreciate
you guys coming out

41:17.892 --> 41:19.892
and everything
that you've done.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.027
I'm here for you,
no matter what,

41:22.029 --> 41:23.296
through thick and thin.

41:24.432 --> 41:25.665
Thank you.

41:27.301 --> 41:29.435
Telling someone
they need to move

41:29.437 --> 41:32.304
is never easy, but
if Wayla contacts

41:32.306 --> 41:35.308
a demonologist and a
psychic Reiki master

41:35.310 --> 41:38.244
to remove Kristian's
negative attachments,

41:38.246 --> 41:40.380
and a psychotherapist
to help him learn

41:40.382 --> 41:43.850
protection measures,
this family can move on

41:43.852 --> 41:46.519
and lead a peaceful
life someplace new.
