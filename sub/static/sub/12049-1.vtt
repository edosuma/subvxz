WEBVTT

00:12.287 --> 00:14.460
There's $900 in cash inside.

00:14.581 --> 00:17.004
Is it Philomena Hazeltine
that has it?

00:17.126 --> 00:18.924
Is it Skip Shippy?
Or is it Irene Smith?

00:19.044 --> 00:20.762
Well, we'll find out
in just a moment.

00:20.879 --> 00:22.927
Irene, do you think you're
the one that has $900?

00:23.048 --> 00:25.050
Because if so, hang on to
it, or you could trade it

00:25.175 --> 00:27.143
for the big box of coating
mix on our display ï¬‚oor,

00:27.261 --> 00:29.855
which Jay is just
dying to describe for us.

00:35.853 --> 00:37.526
Say, Juicy.

00:37.646 --> 00:41.571
Juicy! Get the phone!

00:43.610 --> 00:45.658
Say, man, Juicy!

00:45.779 --> 00:48.498
Where you at? Motherfucker.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.243
Soon as I sit my ass down.

00:51.368 --> 00:54.497
I got to do everything around here.

00:54.621 --> 00:56.498
The hell I pay him for?

00:56.623 --> 01:00.127
Hold on, God damn it. I'm coming.

01:04.548 --> 01:06.596
Shit. Who is this?

01:06.717 --> 01:08.515
You sitting down?

01:08.635 --> 01:10.182
Moselle, is that you?

01:10.304 --> 01:11.726
Are you sitting down?

01:11.847 --> 01:15.568
You have to be sitting down
for when I tell you something.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.779
Oh, baby, you sound different.

01:18.896 --> 01:20.569
What's wrong?

01:20.689 --> 01:22.157
Are you sitting down?

01:22.274 --> 01:24.948
Yes, I am. I have sat the fuck down.

01:25.068 --> 01:26.035
You gonna talk to me or what?

01:26.153 --> 01:28.576
Hey, I'm supposed to tell
you that when you get up,

01:28.697 --> 01:30.745
honey, what's left of
your drug-dealing ass

01:30.866 --> 01:32.914
is gonna go clear through the ceiling.

01:33.035 --> 01:35.709
What?

01:37.498 --> 01:40.217
Excuse me, folks.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.558
Someone sending him a message?

01:48.675 --> 01:49.597
That makes sense.

01:49.718 --> 01:50.810
Otherwise, why not just
shoot the fucker, right?

01:50.928 --> 01:55.354
Couple of years ago, we found a
guy in the trunk of Booker's car.

01:55.474 --> 01:57.442
Two in the back of the head.

01:57.559 --> 01:58.606
Walked with probation.

01:58.727 --> 01:59.603
He's a back fucking dude, man.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.776
Yeah, well, if there's such a
thing as justice in the world,

02:01.897 --> 02:03.649
we just leave his butt sitting there.

02:03.774 --> 02:06.618
Let him work it out.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.329
I don't know where nobody at.

02:09.446 --> 02:11.824
I've been calling.

02:11.949 --> 02:13.576
You see Juicy Mouth?

02:13.700 --> 02:15.293
Who's Juicy Mouth?

02:15.410 --> 02:18.755
He's the sucka that's supposed
to be guarding my body!

02:21.333 --> 02:25.338
I got to
go to the toilet, man.

02:27.631 --> 02:29.679
So what did the woman on the phone say?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.802
She said if I get up, I'm blowing up.

02:31.927 --> 02:34.521
- That's all?
- That's all?

02:34.638 --> 02:36.606
- That's all there is.
- Watch yourself.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.771
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Say, Jack, man.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.816
- Be careful.
- Sit tight.

02:42.479 --> 02:45.198
Oh.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.700
Hmm.

02:47.818 --> 02:50.617
Hmm? Don't give me no hmm shit, man.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.990
What's under there?
What's underneath there?

02:53.115 --> 02:55.288
About 10 sticks of dynamite.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.959
Get that shit from up out of there, man!

02:59.079 --> 03:00.205
Can't. You're sitting on it.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.877
- Hey, come back here.
- Excuse me. Don't move.

03:01.999 --> 03:04.718
- I'll be right back.
- I'm talking to you, motherfucker.

03:04.835 --> 03:06.837
Get back here, you old
cracker ass cracker!

03:06.962 --> 03:08.930
I'm gonna miss being on the bomb squad.

03:09.047 --> 03:12.722
Well, Mary must be jumping up
and down. She finally got her way.

03:12.843 --> 03:16.723
Haven't told her yet. I'm
waiting till I get reassigned.

03:16.847 --> 03:19.100
Maybe homicide, huh?

03:19.224 --> 03:21.397
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.191
Would Mary?

03:23.312 --> 03:25.531
Come on, man, I'm just teasing.

03:25.647 --> 03:27.649
Don't be so serious.

03:27.774 --> 03:28.445
Yeah.

03:28.567 --> 03:31.195
She threw my ass out
on Thursday night, man.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.663
- Mmm.
- Tossed me out.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.783
Now she's banging somebody else.

03:39.077 --> 03:41.705
Well, maybe not homicide.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.252
I've been charged with involvement

03:43.373 --> 03:47.048
in what has come to be known
as the Watergate affair.

03:55.677 --> 03:58.772
And allied forces
of more than 8,000 men today

03:58.889 --> 04:00.732
tighten its hold on the Mekong Delta,

04:00.849 --> 04:03.819
trapping an undetermined
number of North Vietnamese

04:03.935 --> 04:06.154
and Viet Cong.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.694
National Guardsmen
opened fire on demonstrators

04:11.818 --> 04:13.741
at Kent State University in Ohio.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.365
Three people were dead
on arrival at the hospital

04:16.490 --> 04:18.163
and one more died later. They were all-

04:18.283 --> 04:21.708
most of them were just plain
gunned down in cold blood.

04:25.540 --> 04:29.511
Hell, no, we
won't go! Hell, no, we won't go!

04:29.628 --> 04:30.754
Hell, no, we won't go!

04:30.879 --> 04:33.257
I want to say this
to the television audience,

04:33.382 --> 04:35.726
that I welcome this kind of examination

04:35.842 --> 04:36.809
because people have got to know

04:36.927 --> 04:39.601
whether or not their
president is a crook.

04:39.721 --> 04:41.894
Well, I'm not a crook.

04:42.557 --> 04:43.774
I have a dream

04:43.892 --> 04:45.815
that little black
boys and black girls...

04:45.936 --> 04:47.779
I have
some very sad news.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.945
Martin Luther King was
shot and was killed tonight

04:51.066 --> 04:52.238
in Memphis, Tennessee.

04:52.359 --> 04:55.033
Somebody shot
Kennedy right behind the kitchen

04:55.153 --> 04:58.077
in this corridor here as
he was passing through.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.919
The parents of
kidnapped Patricia Hearst today

05:03.036 --> 05:05.710
heard directly from their
daughter for the first time

05:05.831 --> 05:07.833
since she was kidnapped.

05:29.146 --> 05:31.945
Son of a bitch.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.289
- Hello?
- My car's just been stolen.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.784
Mind giving me a lift to my dad's place?

05:41.908 --> 05:43.501
Sure. But doesn't he need a car?

05:43.618 --> 05:45.871
No, he's in Florida.Just
gonna borrow his Caddy.

05:45.996 --> 05:48.966
All right.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.882
Don't you get bored in here?

06:00.927 --> 06:03.601
Here's one for you.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.147
I want to report a rape.

06:13.398 --> 06:16.493
Uh, I'm Sgt. Mankowski.
This is Sgt. Downey.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.784
- She can- - Uh, Sergeant,
I better get out of here.

06:19.905 --> 06:23.660
- Great.
- My husband hates it when I'm late.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.630
- You're in good hands.
- Have a seat.

06:30.499 --> 06:31.751
Uh...

06:31.875 --> 06:35.095
so did this happen to somebody you know?

06:35.212 --> 06:37.055
Somebody in your family?

06:37.172 --> 06:39.595
It happened to me.

06:39.716 --> 06:41.309
Okay, when?

06:41.426 --> 06:43.019
00 A.M.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.604
Do you know the suspect?

06:44.721 --> 06:46.849
Mr. Woodrow Ricks is his name.

06:46.973 --> 06:47.895
And what's your name?

06:48.016 --> 06:50.439
My real name is Greta Wyatt,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.938
my stage name is Ginger La Nova.

06:53.063 --> 06:54.315
So you're an actress?

06:54.439 --> 06:57.443
I'm an actor. You don't
say actress anymore.

06:58.902 --> 07:01.280
And where did this assault take place?

07:01.404 --> 07:05.500
I was at Mr. Ricks'
mansion in Bloomfield Hills.

07:05.617 --> 07:07.244
I don't know the address,but
if you want to meet him,

07:07.369 --> 07:08.962
he has dinner at the
Wolverine Club every night.

07:15.210 --> 07:17.304
All right, so you're out
on a date with this guy

07:17.420 --> 07:19.093
and he brings you back to his place.

07:19.214 --> 07:20.966
No, I was with his brother Mark.

07:21.091 --> 07:22.764
We were at a party at his house.

07:22.884 --> 07:25.763
- It'll make us millions.
- Here's howl make millions.

07:25.887 --> 07:27.560
- I make motion pictures.
- Movies.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.683
There were other girls there, too.

07:29.808 --> 07:31.776
There was some girl named Robin

07:31.893 --> 07:33.770
that Mark was all over.

07:33.895 --> 07:36.819
It was when I
went upstairs to change.

07:36.940 --> 07:40.069
To dry off and put my dress back on.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.911
I forgot to mention
everyone had to go swimming

07:42.028 --> 07:45.248
or Woody said that his chauffeur would
throw you in with your clothes on.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.538
- You went
upstairs... - Uh-huh.

07:47.659 --> 07:49.957
And Woody came in and
I asked him to leave

07:50.078 --> 07:52.581
in a nice way, but he wouldn't.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.209
Did he, you know, perform the act?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.586
Yeah, I guess. As far
as he was concerned.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.841
It was just after a few minutes,
he rolled off of me on the bed

08:01.965 --> 08:02.966
and went to sleep.

08:03.091 --> 08:05.014
All right, what's gonna
make this difficult

08:05.135 --> 08:09.515
is you're reporting a
one-on-one type of situation,

08:09.639 --> 08:13.018
happened a few days
ago, there's no evidence.

08:13.143 --> 08:14.486
So you aren't going to do anything?

08:14.603 --> 08:18.028
Well, if you'll cooperate,
we can at least bring him in,

08:18.148 --> 08:19.741
see if we can get him to admit it.

08:19.858 --> 08:21.326
Woody put it a little differently.

08:21.443 --> 08:25.414
Said if I cooperate,
we could fall in love.

08:43.798 --> 08:45.516
There you are.

08:45.634 --> 08:47.682
It's waiting for you, sir.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.076
The man should be back presently.

09:03.193 --> 09:05.036
Is that right?

09:05.153 --> 09:07.030
What are you telling me for?

09:07.155 --> 09:09.328
Say up there on the sign "no parking."

09:09.449 --> 09:10.541
You the police, ain't you?

09:10.659 --> 09:12.787
Did my sporty attire give it away?

09:12.911 --> 09:15.505
Must be how you got something
wrong with your ribs,

09:15.622 --> 09:17.090
make your coat stick out all funny.

09:17.207 --> 09:19.380
Where'd you do your time?

09:19.501 --> 09:20.718
Jackson?

09:20.835 --> 09:23.054
No, no, Marquette, right?

09:23.171 --> 09:24.673
Man, what you coming down on me for?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.096
'Cause you're about an inch
away from fucking with me.

09:27.217 --> 09:28.890
But you know better, don't you?

09:29.010 --> 09:30.637
Oh, man, you right out of a book.

09:30.762 --> 09:33.811
Old-time dick like all
of them, dumb as shit.

09:33.932 --> 09:36.560
No, stop it! Stop it!

09:39.312 --> 09:41.735
Stop! Stop it!

09:41.856 --> 09:43.950
Help me!

09:44.067 --> 09:45.444
Stop!

09:45.568 --> 09:46.945
Ow.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.322
- Is that Woody?
- Yeah.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.198
She's crazy. Let's get out of here.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.293
You okay? Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

09:53.410 --> 09:54.582
What's going on?

09:54.703 --> 09:58.128
I ask you to cooperate, you turn
into Charlie Bronson with a purse.

09:58.248 --> 10:00.046
- I'm sorry.
- You.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.509
Put your hands on the car.

10:01.626 --> 10:03.924
Put your hands on the fucking
car. You know how to do it.

10:04.045 --> 10:06.468
All right, but don't touch
me, understand? Don't touch me.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.967
Sir, I'm a police officer.
Need you to step out of the car.

10:09.092 --> 10:12.847
- She was hitting me- -
Step out of the fucking car.

10:12.971 --> 10:16.100
Donnell, who is this?

10:16.224 --> 10:18.477
Donnell, he's resisting
arrest. Explain it to him.

10:18.601 --> 10:20.103
Shit, you ain't never
gonna bring him up.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.651
Print that man, his lawyer
will sue your police ass.

10:22.772 --> 10:25.150
I'm gonna get these guys
to drive us to the station.

10:25.275 --> 10:26.993
Peckerwood.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.532
Sit up here, okay?

10:28.653 --> 10:32.123
And don't say a fucking word to Woody.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.834
You're asking for a lot.

10:35.452 --> 10:37.079
Do not! Don't!

10:37.203 --> 10:39.046
Why are you even in this car now?

10:39.164 --> 10:40.916
What, you expect me to drive you?

10:41.041 --> 10:44.170
You want to drive us, Donnell.
You just don't know it yet.

10:44.294 --> 10:46.012
Move it, Woody.

10:57.515 --> 11:00.314
- Cut.
- Huh? What do you think?

11:00.435 --> 11:03.279
That was beautiful, right? Shadooby.

11:05.774 --> 11:08.072
I'm groovy and you're not.

11:08.193 --> 11:09.115
We are okay.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.660
Hey, make sure the
stunt guy is okay there.

11:24.793 --> 11:27.967
- That Robin?
- Hello, Skip.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.841
Pull my pants down and
smack me three times.

11:30.965 --> 11:33.809
Come here, girl. Oh, sweetie.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.555
Darlin', let me look at you.
Oh, my God.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.681
Man. Yeah, you look gorgeous.

11:38.807 --> 11:40.775
See that? How long you been here?

11:40.892 --> 11:42.144
- Awhile.
- A while, huh?

11:42.268 --> 11:43.394
You see that? That was great.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.397
When the car came, that's
called the kush shot.

11:45.522 --> 11:47.365
- Yeah.
- See, when the car hits the water,

11:47.482 --> 11:50.201
- it goes kush!
- Oh.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.364
- You like your work, huh?
- The movies,

11:53.488 --> 11:57.209
it's a lot of bullshit,
but I guess it's pretty fun.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.874
There's a story in today's
paper that made me think of you.

11:59.994 --> 12:03.043
- Yeah?
- About that drug dealer getting blown up.

12:03.164 --> 12:04.211
Oh, yeah. I saw that.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.255
Somebody slipped some
dynamite under him.

12:06.376 --> 12:08.299
Wasn't me, though. I was working.

12:08.419 --> 12:10.387
I haven't set off any dynamite in...

12:10.505 --> 12:12.473
let's just say it's been a while.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.764
I bet you still know how.

12:15.885 --> 12:17.933
I'll bet I do.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.390
I kept a journal, you know.

12:20.515 --> 12:22.108
Of everything we ever did.

12:22.225 --> 12:23.693
I always liked your writing.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.279
You had a real mean sound.
You're still doing it, right?

12:26.396 --> 12:29.275
I did "Notes From Underground"
for a couple years.

12:29.399 --> 12:31.572
Liberation News Service picked it up.

12:31.693 --> 12:32.569
Yeah?

12:32.694 --> 12:34.617
Now I write historical romance novels.

12:34.737 --> 12:37.240
You had a pretty wild ride.
You should write your own stuff.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.242
- It'd be more exciting.
- I have a better idea.

12:39.367 --> 12:43.292
My apartment is right around the corner.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.381
I have some acid.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.463
You are setting me up for something.

12:47.584 --> 12:49.382
You got a dirty trick in
mind and you need the Skipper

12:49.502 --> 12:52.927
to help you pull it of-F, don't you?

12:53.047 --> 12:55.175
Kush.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.269
- The air is heavy.
- Hey, Skip.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.014
Remember the night we
got arrested and you said

13:01.139 --> 13:03.358
there was no way that anyone
could have recognized us?

13:03.474 --> 13:08.321
Well, I made a list of names of
everybody that had contact with us.

13:08.438 --> 13:10.657
And I've crossed off all the names

13:10.773 --> 13:13.071
until finally I'm left with two.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.949
Ah.

13:19.073 --> 13:22.202
Mark Ricks. Yeah, I remember him.

13:22.327 --> 13:23.499
He had that bullhorn.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.248
Used to get everybody
worked up into a lather.

13:26.372 --> 13:29.091
They'd start chanting.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.301
Woody Ricks.

13:30.418 --> 13:33.388
Yeah, that was the brother.

13:33.504 --> 13:35.973
Always stoned.

13:36.090 --> 13:37.888
Yeah, he was always sloppy.

13:38.009 --> 13:40.228
He was doing that little wiggle dance

13:40.345 --> 13:44.145
trying to get his pants
out of his butt crack.

13:44.265 --> 13:44.766
Oh.

13:44.891 --> 13:48.361
Well, guess what happened when
mom finally drank herself under

13:48.478 --> 13:50.355
and they did a reading of the will.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.606
Mom's fave got paid?

13:51.731 --> 13:56.737
Woody scored something like 50 million.

13:56.861 --> 13:58.078
Plus the house.

13:58.196 --> 13:59.322
50? Holy shit.

13:59.447 --> 14:03.953
I'll bet the other one didn't get
shit for being a smart-ass, huh?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.079
He was always picking on his brother.

14:06.204 --> 14:08.206
Woody bought Mark a theater in Pontiac.

14:08.331 --> 14:09.332
Now Mark does musicals.

14:09.457 --> 14:12.131
All right, so let me
see if I got this straight.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.926
You think these two turned us in.

14:15.046 --> 14:17.674
Now they're sitting on 50 mil

14:17.799 --> 14:21.349
and you're feeling like they owe
you a piece. Is that about it?

14:21.469 --> 14:26.475
We feel like they owe
usa piece.

14:28.393 --> 14:30.771
You are setting me up
just like you used to,

14:30.895 --> 14:33.318
and I love it.

14:35.233 --> 14:39.238
I'm gonna need to get
us some explosives.

14:39.362 --> 14:40.363
Dynamite and acid,

14:40.488 --> 14:42.741
that's a combo that'll Star Trek you

14:42.865 --> 14:45.163
right back to the good old days.

14:46.077 --> 14:47.420
But what if these two

14:47.537 --> 14:49.335
ain't the ones that set us up?

14:49.455 --> 14:53.050
What difference does it make?

15:04.512 --> 15:05.308
Hello.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.353
Dynamite Skip at your service.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.147
We're officially entering
the straight world.

15:10.268 --> 15:12.691
I'm going after them tonight.

15:12.812 --> 15:13.404
All of a sudden?

15:13.521 --> 15:17.116
Mark's picture is in the paper today.

15:17.233 --> 15:21.409
Honorary chairman for a benefit
to raise money for the governor.

15:21.529 --> 15:25.659
Woody's going, too. It's a
buffet cruise around the marina.

15:25.783 --> 15:27.035
You're going?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.457
No, I'm gonna stake it out.

15:28.578 --> 15:31.252
Oh, I'll call you after
I get to Marysville

15:31.372 --> 15:32.419
and line up some hot sticks.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.087
I hope my contact's still there.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.178
Skip, I forgot to mention.

15:37.295 --> 15:40.265
Guess who Woody's driver is.

15:40.381 --> 15:41.132
Donnell Lewis.

15:41.257 --> 15:43.851
Remember the party to
raise bail for the Panthers?

15:43.968 --> 15:45.595
It was at Mark and Woody's.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.848
I remember you coming
out of the bathroom

15:47.972 --> 15:50.020
with some brother
wearing a leather coat.

15:50.141 --> 15:51.438
That was Donnell?

15:51.559 --> 15:53.186
I don't know. I can't remember.

15:53.311 --> 15:56.406
Robin, listen, I got an
ear for bullshit, honey.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.696
All right? I've been working in
the movie business along time.

15:59.817 --> 16:02.115
Now if I'm gonna come
along on this little ride,

16:02.236 --> 16:04.330
I don't want any more surprises, okay?

16:04.447 --> 16:07.166
That's why I told you.

16:21.839 --> 16:24.342
Got a VIP seat right here.

16:40.942 --> 16:42.569
My boat's dry-docked right now

16:42.693 --> 16:44.320
because it's getting a paint job.

16:44.445 --> 16:46.573
Baby blue, baby.

16:46.697 --> 16:49.041
I don't know. Your brother says

16:49.158 --> 16:51.581
he's had his eye on my talent
for quite a long time now.

16:51.702 --> 16:54.672
Oh, yeah, well, don't worry about him.

16:54.789 --> 16:57.713
He's celibate. I basically run the show.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.553
Oh, hang on a minute. You.

17:00.670 --> 17:01.512
You.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.347
I want to know where have you been

17:03.464 --> 17:05.683
and why haven't you called me?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.019
Well, let's see. I did time.

17:08.136 --> 17:09.729
That's one thing.

17:09.846 --> 17:12.974
33 months and 10 days.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.224
Yeah.

17:14.349 --> 17:15.771
I couldn't believe that.

17:15.893 --> 17:17.440
But then I heard you're back in town.

17:17.561 --> 17:20.816
I've written two
historical romance novels.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.532
You're putting me on.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.531
With a lot of rape and adverbs.

17:26.612 --> 17:29.240
Listen, why don't you join us?

17:29.365 --> 17:31.413
We're going back to my
brother's for a little...

17:31.534 --> 17:32.831
after-party.

17:32.952 --> 17:38.004
Give us a little chance to... talk.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.967
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

17:43.087 --> 17:45.181
No! Okay.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.641
Yes.

17:46.757 --> 17:49.556
How was that for you?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.224
It wasn't bad.

17:51.345 --> 17:54.519
Wasn't bad? Okay.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.735
Wasn't bad? Wasn't good? What?

17:57.852 --> 18:01.607
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom.

18:05.359 --> 18:07.282
Oh, phew.

18:16.704 --> 18:20.629
Oh, party's in full swing.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.751
Ooh.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.427
You really turn me on, babe.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.926
Glad I finally found a purpose.

18:30.051 --> 18:32.224
Wow, when I look at you,

18:32.345 --> 18:35.599
I get a rush like I
could just do anything!

18:35.723 --> 18:36.849
Ow!

18:36.974 --> 18:38.396
Why can't you?

18:38.518 --> 18:40.020
I told you. Woody-

18:40.144 --> 18:43.114
he holds me back, smothers me.

18:43.231 --> 18:46.110
Well, he resents you.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.697
Your looks, personality.

18:51.656 --> 18:54.284
Yeah, he always has been jealous.

18:54.408 --> 18:56.285
Always.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.754
Now he's getting back at me.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.623
He thinks it's funny.

19:00.748 --> 19:04.423
I tell him it's not
fair and he grins at me.

19:04.544 --> 19:08.299
So there's no chance
he'll ever cut you in?

19:09.757 --> 19:11.725
Not unless he dies.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.660
This is way beyond your call of duty.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.496
This car is beautiful.

19:32.613 --> 19:35.241
Well, don't get too excited.

19:35.366 --> 19:38.119
It's my dad's. He's in Florida.

19:40.746 --> 19:43.716
The doctor said it's just a mild sprain.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.961
Oh, great. That's good.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.928
Good to hear.

19:48.045 --> 19:49.843
What's wrong?

19:49.964 --> 19:51.682
I've been suspended.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.676
They kicked you out? Why?

19:53.801 --> 19:56.429
You want the official
reason or the real one?

19:56.554 --> 19:58.807
Both.

19:59.140 --> 20:02.895
Well, the real reason is
because I put Woody in jail.

20:04.061 --> 20:05.404
His lawyer called the mayor's office.

20:05.521 --> 20:06.738
They dropped it on the department.

20:06.856 --> 20:09.860
Got the assault charge
against Woody withdrawn

20:09.984 --> 20:13.454
on the grounds that he was
the one assaulted, not you.

20:13.571 --> 20:14.663
That I overreacted.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.453
So that's the real reason.

20:16.574 --> 20:18.201
What's the official one?

20:18.326 --> 20:20.795
Having a residence
outside the city limits.

20:20.911 --> 20:23.380
You're kidding. You
have to live in Detroit?

20:23.497 --> 20:25.966
Yeah. It's one of the rules.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.380
So why don't you?

20:27.501 --> 20:30.675
Well, I did up until last week.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.891
My
- my girl kicked me out.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.557
So I'm staying at my dad's place.

20:38.387 --> 20:40.481
I got you fired.

20:40.598 --> 20:42.646
No, you did not.

20:42.767 --> 20:43.233
Woody did.

20:43.351 --> 20:46.480
I don't want you to give
that another thought, okay?

20:46.604 --> 20:48.106
I'll handle it.

20:49.857 --> 20:54.738
How about a grilled cheese
sandwich and a cup of coffee?

20:55.529 --> 20:57.907
If I have any bread

20:58.032 --> 21:00.501
and coffee.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.583
What you don't have is furniture.

21:06.707 --> 21:09.711
Furniture can wait.

21:14.006 --> 21:14.928
Hey, Mom.

21:15.049 --> 21:17.893
Greta? You like Greta
or you like Ginger?

21:18.010 --> 21:20.809
- I like Ginger myself.
- Who is this?

21:20.930 --> 21:22.648
I represent Mr. Woody Ricks.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.608
There seems to be some misunderstanding.

21:24.725 --> 21:29.731
I believe we can settle this matter
and you will be happy, Ginger.

21:29.855 --> 21:30.856
Is this his lawyer?

21:30.981 --> 21:34.952
Yeah, I'll talk with the
man and get back to you.

21:39.907 --> 21:43.332
It's Woody's chauffer
pretending to be his lawyer.

21:43.452 --> 21:45.045
It's Donnell.

21:45.162 --> 21:47.915
They know where I live.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.046
You'll be safer at my dad's.

21:54.171 --> 21:57.266
Just until I get this thing
figured out, all right?

21:57.383 --> 21:58.760
Look, I'm not a kid.

21:58.884 --> 22:02.104
I don't need you to take care of me.

22:04.098 --> 22:06.396
I know that.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.368
Ready? Listen.

22:16.485 --> 22:18.237
So now you're waiting,

22:18.362 --> 22:20.911
but hoping maybe he'll
maybe drink himself to death?

22:21.031 --> 22:23.033
- Mark.
- Huh?

22:23.159 --> 22:25.628
What would you say if
you didn't have to wait?

22:25.745 --> 22:29.090
If Woody were to suddenly disappear?

22:29.206 --> 22:31.880
- How?
- In a cloud of smoke.

22:32.001 --> 22:34.629
Is this like a magic trick?

22:34.754 --> 22:38.179
Something
like it, only better.

22:38.299 --> 22:40.393
Better? Okay, how?

22:40.509 --> 22:43.763
Because once he
disappears, he never comes back.

22:43.888 --> 22:44.935
What would you say to that?

22:45.055 --> 22:47.774
I'd say how much is
a trick like that worth?

22:47.892 --> 22:50.736
50 million, right?

22:50.853 --> 22:52.981
It might not be that much.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.858
- There's one thing you have to do.
- What?

22:55.983 --> 22:58.611
Get me a key to Woody's limo.

22:58.736 --> 23:01.364
Oh, okay.

23:02.907 --> 23:04.909
Don't look so surprised, Skip.

23:05.034 --> 23:06.786
You get me that key,

23:06.911 --> 23:09.255
I'll put the bomb in the trunk.

23:09.371 --> 23:11.169
He opens the door,

23:11.290 --> 23:13.008
great balls of fire.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.674
What if he opens the other door?

23:16.796 --> 23:19.595
I'll wire them both.

23:21.091 --> 23:22.684
Hey, Donnell.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.931
Who would you rather pork?

23:26.055 --> 23:29.605
This brunette

23:29.725 --> 23:31.819
or that Swedish broad?

23:31.936 --> 23:33.904
- Brunette.
- Yeah.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.944
Because she has my favorite
kind of body on her.

23:36.065 --> 23:40.036
Right. Hey, where's my weed?

23:41.028 --> 23:43.030
Must have left it in the car.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.829
Be right back.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.468
Damn.

24:00.589 --> 24:02.011
Must've been like two weeks ago.

24:02.132 --> 24:06.729
Picked up most of a whole pound of weed,

24:06.846 --> 24:08.564
then left it in the...

24:13.060 --> 24:16.314
Somebody don't like the man.

24:30.661 --> 24:33.505
You horny little bitch.

24:34.331 --> 24:37.210
But, Mr. Woody, if the brunette
wouldn't straighten her hair,

24:37.334 --> 24:39.837
I'd tell the bimbo to get a wig.

24:41.005 --> 24:42.973
Put on a musical.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.559
It goes better with weed.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.096
You got it.

25:19.585 --> 25:22.805
Now here
they are with their specialty number,

25:22.922 --> 25:25.425
music to watch girls by.

25:32.806 --> 25:34.399
May I help you?

25:34.516 --> 25:36.018
How's my brother?

25:36.143 --> 25:37.895
Beautiful. The man remains above

25:38.020 --> 25:39.943
earthly shit like
police stations and jail.

25:40.064 --> 25:43.034
The man's all the way live
and into his pleasures.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.076
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

25:45.194 --> 25:47.663
I know you do.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.533
This the one where
Carmen Miranda come out

25:50.658 --> 25:53.161
with all that fruit
and shit on her head?

25:56.413 --> 25:58.461
Where are my peanuts?

25:58.582 --> 26:00.550
Got the munchies.

26:00.668 --> 26:02.386
You got the munchies, huh?

26:02.503 --> 26:04.301
Well, you done ate all the peanuts up.

26:04.421 --> 26:06.048
Have to wait till I get some.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.551
Doesn't he keep peanuts in his car?

26:08.676 --> 26:11.054
I'll go look. Where are the keys?

26:12.721 --> 26:14.064
Yeah, the keys.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.275
They're in the kitchen
on a hook by the door.

26:16.392 --> 26:19.145
Wait now. The peanuts
have to be in the backseat.

26:19.269 --> 26:21.146
- You understand?
- Yeah, the back. Yeah.

26:21.271 --> 26:24.616
- Yeah.
- I want to see this part.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.201
We both do.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.241
But I want my peanuts.

26:28.362 --> 26:29.784
Your brother went to get them.

26:29.905 --> 26:33.250
My brother? What is
my brother doing here?

26:33.367 --> 26:35.165
We gonna find out.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.046
Or we might never.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.460
Look at that shit.

26:39.581 --> 26:41.879
Look how they holding their bananas.

26:46.422 --> 26:48.971
You sure were a happy kid.

26:49.091 --> 26:50.092
Oh, yeah.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.936
What do you want on your burger?

26:53.053 --> 26:55.772
Uh,just ketchup if you have it.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.194
So your dad's in...

27:00.310 --> 27:01.857
Florida.

27:01.979 --> 27:04.823
Excuse me.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.826
Hello.

27:07.943 --> 27:10.696
Hey, Jerry. What's up?

27:14.408 --> 27:16.581
You're kidding.

27:19.538 --> 27:23.213
Yeah.

27:23.333 --> 27:26.587
I'll be there. All right.

27:28.797 --> 27:30.765
That was my partner.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.931
Somebody blew up Woody's limo.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.054
Homicide wants to talk to me.

27:35.179 --> 27:37.432
Why, because it was meant for Woody?

27:38.265 --> 27:40.563
I guess they figure if
you can take a bomb apart,

27:40.684 --> 27:41.901
YOU can DUI one together.

27:42.019 --> 27:44.238
Give me a hand over here on this side.

27:44.354 --> 27:46.277
All right.

27:50.611 --> 27:55.037
Mankowski, you gonna confess or
do I have to beat it out of you?

27:55.157 --> 27:57.159
Wasn't me, I swear.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.628
That's enough of that shit.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.294
The other people...

28:03.290 --> 28:05.543
gonna want to talk to you.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.044
Jesus Christ.

28:07.169 --> 28:08.967
I think this one should be easy.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.840
Man gets a bomb put in his car,

28:10.964 --> 28:12.932
must be somebody not liking him, right?

28:13.050 --> 28:14.347
Or somebody gains from it.

28:14.468 --> 28:17.722
Except the only one to
gain, according to Woody,

28:17.846 --> 28:19.189
is the one that got blown up.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.104
I think that's what Woody told me.

28:21.225 --> 28:22.727
What about Donnell?

28:22.851 --> 28:25.730
Man's been arrested
for assault, robbery,

28:25.854 --> 28:27.697
extortion, causing disturbances.

28:27.815 --> 28:29.567
How does he get next to Woody?

28:29.691 --> 28:32.911
Well, he claims they've known
each other for a long time.

28:33.028 --> 28:36.202
Says Mr. Woody took him in,

28:36.323 --> 28:37.996
changed his life.

28:38.117 --> 28:41.166
All right, what was his
brother doing outside?

28:41.286 --> 28:44.256
Mark went to get Woody some peanuts.

28:44.373 --> 28:47.217
And I asked Woody.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.587
Comes like a skid row burnout.

28:50.712 --> 28:52.680
What if it was Donnell that set it up?

28:52.798 --> 28:57.269
Somehow he gets Mark to come
outside to get the peanuts.

28:57.386 --> 28:58.387
That's possible.

28:58.512 --> 29:02.437
I might be able to use
a guy like you, Chris.

29:02.558 --> 29:05.277
If you ever decide to move back to town.

29:05.394 --> 29:07.988
See, with these kinds of
folks, you got to kind of

29:08.105 --> 29:10.699
know how to step outside, so to speak.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.410
Let them do their own
kind of freaky deaky.

29:13.527 --> 29:15.655
What, the sexy dance?

29:15.779 --> 29:18.828
People are shooting each other over it.

29:18.949 --> 29:21.247
Two homicides come to mind.

29:21.368 --> 29:24.463
You freaky deak with
somebody else's woman,

29:24.580 --> 29:26.082
you get seriously hurt.

29:26.206 --> 29:27.628
Or you could get lucky.

29:27.749 --> 29:30.377
Depends how you look at it.

29:32.629 --> 29:34.927
And now for the
latest on the car bombing...

29:35.048 --> 29:38.552
I can catch my hand. Look at that.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.850
I can catch my own hand.

29:40.971 --> 29:43.269
Now what do we do? God damn it, Skip.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.314
If you would have just waited for
Mark to get the key to the limo.

29:46.435 --> 29:48.654
We'll just go back to the original plan.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.568
We blow up his fucking house.

29:50.689 --> 29:51.815
It might be too soon.

29:51.940 --> 29:52.987
The sooner the better.

29:53.108 --> 29:56.237
While it's still ringing in his
ears, you deliver the message.

29:56.361 --> 29:59.285
"Holy shit, these guys are serious."

30:08.415 --> 30:10.417
I hear you're out of these.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.466
Heard if you hadn't run out of nuts,

30:13.587 --> 30:15.635
guy's brother would still be alive.

30:15.756 --> 30:18.305
What was his name? Mark?

30:18.425 --> 30:21.429
Somebody else would have
opened up the car door.

30:22.471 --> 30:25.145
Can't imagine Woody opening the door.

30:25.265 --> 30:27.859
I mean, that's what
he's got you for, right?

30:27.976 --> 30:29.853
To open doors.

30:31.313 --> 30:33.361
What else do you do for him, Donnell?

30:33.482 --> 30:35.860
Maybe call up a young lady,

30:35.984 --> 30:38.032
tell her there appears
to be a misunderstanding.

30:38.153 --> 30:40.201
Wait now. What's this
shit you're giving me?

30:40.322 --> 30:42.575
- What I did?
- You called Greta Wyatt.

30:42.699 --> 30:44.326
Tell me again who she is.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.203
She's the one you're gonna see in court

30:46.328 --> 30:48.046
when Woody's brought
up on a rape charge.

30:48.163 --> 30:49.380
So what you telling me?

30:49.498 --> 30:51.375
You speaking for the lady, huh?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.673
Who needs lawyers, right?

30:53.794 --> 30:54.795
Yeah.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.844
I see you come to visit,
drive up in a new Caddy.

30:57.965 --> 31:00.138
You manage on about maybe

31:00.259 --> 31:02.353
three bills a week take-home.

31:02.469 --> 31:04.892
Yeah, I see you interested
in payoffs, rake-offs.

31:05.013 --> 31:07.732
Get the bitch to hold out when I'm
willing to make a generous offer.

31:07.849 --> 31:09.192
What the fuck did you just call her?

31:09.309 --> 31:10.310
Hey, shit, you're her lawyer.

31:10.435 --> 31:11.357
What else? Gonna protect her good name?

31:11.478 --> 31:14.402
I'll tell you right now, I
saw her in bed with the man,

31:14.523 --> 31:16.196
doing a job on him, too.

31:16.316 --> 31:18.318
Where is he?

31:18.443 --> 31:20.946
Who, Mr. Woody? Having his swim.

31:21.071 --> 31:22.948
Let's go talk to him.

31:23.907 --> 31:26.706
Man, you love being a cop, don't you?

31:29.579 --> 31:30.421
Is he all right?

31:30.539 --> 31:33.088
All the way
live as he want to be.

31:33.208 --> 31:36.052
I don't see him breathing.

31:36.169 --> 31:37.716
Watch his tummy.

31:37.838 --> 31:40.637
See it move? Right there.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.682
So that's what it's
like to be rich, huh?

31:44.803 --> 31:48.023
Whatever turns you on.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.188
Why does somebody want him dead?

31:50.517 --> 31:53.441
The dude cop asked me that
every way he could think of.

31:53.562 --> 31:54.688
Wants to know was it me.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.986
I ask him, 'What's my gain?"

31:59.693 --> 32:03.414
I understand he had a
friend here on Friday night.

32:03.530 --> 32:04.497
A woman he used to know.

32:04.614 --> 32:07.914
Yeah, there was one
here. Come with Mark.

32:08.035 --> 32:10.208
Just trying to think of her name.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.457
- Robin?
- Yeah, Robin Abbot.

32:12.581 --> 32:14.675
Oh, you sneaky.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.418
We talking about the bombs,

32:16.543 --> 32:18.591
now you have us back on
the other conversation.

32:18.712 --> 32:21.340
You're looking for
somebody who was here Friday

32:21.465 --> 32:24.093
to be a witness and testify
against Mr. Woody, huh?

32:24.217 --> 32:25.434
Mr. Woody.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.429
Brought you some peanuts.

32:27.554 --> 32:29.556
See what he's doing, Mr. Woody?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.775
Wants to get on your good side.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.482
Where's he going?

32:34.603 --> 32:36.947
Have a cold shower, wake him up.

32:37.064 --> 32:40.568
He'll be back in a minute
to start his cocktail hour.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.534
You ever swim with him?

32:44.654 --> 32:49.581
Man, getting all wet has
never been one of my pleasures.

32:55.665 --> 32:57.633
You don't know how to swim, huh?

32:58.585 --> 33:01.338
That can happen when you
grow up in the projects.

33:01.463 --> 33:04.683
Some guys turn to crime.

33:08.637 --> 33:11.516
How much you gonna offer Miss Wyatt?

33:11.640 --> 33:14.519
Motherfucker, you lucky you a cop.

33:16.019 --> 33:17.521
Sorry, can't hear you.

33:17.646 --> 33:19.614
5,000.

33:22.359 --> 33:24.487
Let me give you a hand.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.613
I get confused sometimes.

33:26.738 --> 33:30.038
Everything that's been happening to me.

33:30.158 --> 33:31.785
My brother passed away.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.872
Mr. Ricks.

33:34.996 --> 33:37.374
You're planning to make
an offer to a young lady

33:37.499 --> 33:39.627
so she won't sign a
complaint against you

33:39.751 --> 33:41.845
on this rape charge
we've been talking about.

33:41.962 --> 33:43.714
Oh, yeah, that's right.

33:43.839 --> 33:45.637
I'm a friend of hers.

33:46.883 --> 33:49.511
I didn't know that.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.684
You're talking about Ginger.

33:53.306 --> 33:55.183
No, I didn't rape her.

33:55.308 --> 33:57.185
She was in my bedroom.

33:58.478 --> 34:02.278
Didn't have on a stitch of clothes.

34:02.399 --> 34:03.946
She's standing there.

34:04.067 --> 34:05.489
What would you do?

34:05.610 --> 34:09.614
I mean, if she wasn't a friend of yours.

34:09.739 --> 34:11.536
Wait a minute.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.161
Let's forget the whole thing.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.583
Um...

34:15.704 --> 34:19.129
I think 10,000 sounds fair, don't you?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.253
It was based on what my time is worth.

34:22.377 --> 34:25.051
I think that's how we did it.

34:25.172 --> 34:25.547
$10,000?

34:25.672 --> 34:29.597
Donnell said that maybe
she would rather have cash

34:29.717 --> 34:30.560
instead of the check.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.271
Did you mention this to your lawyer?

34:33.804 --> 34:37.685
My lawyer? No. Donnell is cheaper.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.487
He only went to the 10th grade,

34:40.603 --> 34:42.902
but he knows how to talk to people.

34:43.023 --> 34:45.321
He's smart. He'll surprise you.

34:45.442 --> 34:47.739
Kind of fella you can rely on.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.579
You betcha.

34:54.242 --> 34:56.665
You ever look at a dog and wonder

34:56.786 --> 34:58.709
what he's thinking?

35:00.707 --> 35:02.755
All the time.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.635
Kind of the same thing
with Woody, right?

35:07.756 --> 35:09.724
Right?

35:11.301 --> 35:13.724
That guy's a trip.

35:14.721 --> 35:18.646
I look at a guy like
that with all his money,

35:18.767 --> 35:21.190
and I'm thinking, "What-

35:21.311 --> 35:23.609
what good does he do?

35:23.730 --> 35:26.449
What the fuck is he good for?" You know?

35:26.566 --> 35:28.614
Doesn't serve any purpose.

35:28.735 --> 35:31.659
Not many people do.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.494
Mr. Woody, something's bothering me.

35:37.619 --> 35:41.419
Now, what the police will do is talk
to the people who were here Friday.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.669
Try to find one to tell
them Ginger went upstairs

35:44.793 --> 35:45.885
and you went up there after her.

35:46.002 --> 35:49.506
I'm saying if Ginger doesn't
accept your generous offer.

35:49.631 --> 35:52.009
Now, I doubt your friends
noticed you were gone,

35:52.133 --> 35:53.806
ï¬‚ying high on the blow and all,

35:53.927 --> 35:55.554
but there was this one lady here.

35:55.679 --> 35:58.808
Wasn't of your regular group.
She had on a brown dress.

35:58.932 --> 36:01.276
Oh, Robin.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.646
Robin Abbot, right?

36:03.770 --> 36:06.068
Robin. She was something else.

36:06.189 --> 36:07.236
Yeah.

36:07.357 --> 36:10.452
What did the police get her
for back in the day? It was-

36:10.569 --> 36:13.664
It was the FBI for that time
that she and her boyfriend

36:13.780 --> 36:16.659
blew up that cop car.
You don't remember that?

36:16.783 --> 36:17.659
I must have been gone.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.663
You know what she used
to do if she needed money?

36:20.787 --> 36:22.710
She used to unbutton her shirt

36:22.831 --> 36:25.675
and then she'd open it up

36:25.792 --> 36:28.841
and she'd let me see her goodies.

36:28.962 --> 36:32.011
Let you see 'em, huh?

36:32.132 --> 36:33.679
Yeah.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.179
Mr. Woody, you telling me this woman

36:37.304 --> 36:39.773
knows how to set bombs?

36:41.641 --> 36:41.982
Yeah.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.150
Let's set it in the bushes up
close to one of the concrete lions.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.648
Why there?

36:47.772 --> 36:49.240
'Cause that way when I call,

36:49.357 --> 36:51.576
I can say some badass
shit to Woody like,

36:51.693 --> 36:55.743
'When you hear the lion roar,
then you know we mean business."

36:55.864 --> 36:56.706
Yeah.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.246
Then you get to have me.

36:59.367 --> 37:01.495
Right now?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.873
We need condoms.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.095
All right, look, I forgot my wallet.

37:10.211 --> 37:12.054
You got to loan me five bucks.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.516
Are you sure you don't
want your dad's room?

37:23.058 --> 37:26.688
No, no, no. My stuff
is in the other bedroom.

37:26.811 --> 37:29.530
So it's all yours.

37:35.362 --> 37:37.660
Uh, good night.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.708
Good night, Chris.

38:43.930 --> 38:47.730
Mankowski! Are you coming or not?

38:49.352 --> 38:51.275
Give me some rubbers.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.194
Oh, weenie wrappers, huh?

38:53.314 --> 38:55.817
Here they are. What kind do you like?

38:55.942 --> 38:57.819
I don't care. Any kind will do.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.914
You like the sheepskin
or the premium latex?

39:01.030 --> 39:02.828
Ahem, uh, latex.

39:02.949 --> 39:07.705
Would you like regular,
ï¬‚avored or studded?

39:08.288 --> 39:12.043
The new Her Pleasure are very popular.

39:12.167 --> 39:15.888
Well, this one is the economy pack.

39:16.004 --> 39:19.053
You get three dozen for $7.59.

39:24.637 --> 39:28.232
Tell you what. You get me a
dozen of these boxes right here.

39:28.349 --> 39:31.273
Just lay them right
down here in this jacket.

39:31.394 --> 39:34.318
While he's doing that,
you unload the register.

39:34.439 --> 39:37.318
Then lay down on the
ground. You unload, you load.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.864
All right? That's it.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.828
Hey, hey, Kenny, Kenny. What's this?

39:40.945 --> 39:44.745
Don't want any of this ribbed
shit. I want regular. Regular.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.042
How many did you get?

39:54.167 --> 39:57.797
- 432.
- We can always get more.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.561
I think I need
a different stage name.

40:08.681 --> 40:13.027
Ginger La Nova doesn't end
with a smile when you say it.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.273
Like Sweeney.

40:16.397 --> 40:18.445
Say it. Sweeney.

40:18.566 --> 40:21.536
Your mouth forms a smile.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.203
What about Mankowski?

40:26.324 --> 40:27.496
Hmm?

40:27.617 --> 40:29.961
Ginger Mankowski.
Say that.

40:40.046 --> 40:40.592
Yeah?

40:40.713 --> 40:43.091
When is your father gonna
start charging you rent?

40:43.216 --> 40:45.310
- You freeloader.
- Oh, hey, Maureen.

40:45.426 --> 40:48.396
It's Sgt. Downey, sex crimes.

40:48.513 --> 40:49.605
What's that? Yeah.

40:49.722 --> 40:52.976
I have the address on Robin Abbot.

40:53.101 --> 40:54.944
Hang on.

40:55.061 --> 40:57.189
- 25...
- 550?

40:57.313 --> 40:59.281
- No.
- 15?

40:59.399 --> 41:01.322
No, 2550.

41:01.442 --> 41:04.662
- 550 or 515.
- No, 50.

41:04.779 --> 41:07.783
- Come on.
- Or 51...

41:07.907 --> 41:10.831
Are you okay? 2550.

41:10.952 --> 41:13.000
<i>- Can't-
550- - Yeah.</i>

41:13.121 --> 41:15.670
Hang on a second.

41:15.790 --> 41:16.962
Ma'am.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.929
Gonna have to ask you to
put that thing away, okay?

41:21.045 --> 41:21.967
Get out of here.

41:22.088 --> 41:25.012
- 515 Kenfield.
- No.

41:25.133 --> 41:27.431
Soon as you have your breakfast,

41:27.552 --> 41:29.805
we have to tend to some business.

41:29.929 --> 41:32.523
Mr. Woody, what you do,

41:32.640 --> 41:33.983
you put your underwear on first.

41:34.100 --> 41:37.024
Then you sit there on the
ï¬‚oor and put your trousers on

41:37.145 --> 41:39.022
so you don't kill yourself.

41:39.147 --> 41:40.945
I want to see my horoscope.

41:41.065 --> 41:42.988
I'll get it for you. Read
it with your breakfast.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.487
We have to talk about getting
this bomb mess cleaned up.

41:45.612 --> 41:47.990
Have it hauled away. You
want me to take care of it?

41:48.114 --> 41:51.243
Call somebody. Newspaper come?

41:51.367 --> 41:53.244
I'm gonna get it for you.

41:53.369 --> 41:56.714
We have to talk about
getting you a new limousine.

41:56.831 --> 41:59.300
What kind you want? What you want in it?

41:59.417 --> 42:00.964
All that.

42:01.085 --> 42:03.804
- I want a Cadillac.
- That's cool.

42:03.922 --> 42:04.297
Yeah.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.095
But what we have to do first, Mr. Woody,

42:06.215 --> 42:07.888
is see how you want to change your will

42:08.009 --> 42:09.010
now that your brother is gone.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.388
I thought me and you could
rough it out, understand?

42:11.512 --> 42:13.685
Put it all down on a piece
of paper and you sign it.

42:13.806 --> 42:17.276
You know,just in case you don't
talk to your lawyer for a while.

42:17.393 --> 42:21.569
I want a silver one.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.368
Mr. Woody, you want to
look up here a minute?

42:26.235 --> 42:28.329
Now, you understand
it could happen again.

42:28.446 --> 42:31.074
Barn! You get taken out,
you're not even looking.

42:31.199 --> 42:32.166
You don't even hear it.

42:32.283 --> 42:35.036
That's why I'm saying you
got to change your will, man.

42:35.161 --> 42:39.507
Mr. Woody, in case anything might
happen you don't even know about.

42:43.670 --> 42:46.514
Will you get the paper?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.393
Tell you where we're at.

42:50.510 --> 42:52.012
Maureen looks for Robin

42:52.136 --> 42:55.106
as a possible witness
in a sexual assault case.

42:55.223 --> 42:57.146
But now Robin is a suspect

42:57.266 --> 42:59.735
in a homicide investigation.

42:59.852 --> 43:02.401
Homicide's gonna take priority.

43:04.315 --> 43:06.693
I thought about Woody's offer.

43:08.569 --> 43:10.412
I think I'm gonna take it.

43:11.239 --> 43:15.164
- It's up to you.
- You think I'm wrong.

43:18.579 --> 43:20.798
It's strange, when I see him

43:20.915 --> 43:23.213
as this pathetic creature...

43:24.794 --> 43:27.513
it almost changes howl picture him

43:27.630 --> 43:30.053
sexually assaulting me.

43:31.592 --> 43:33.094
You know, honestly, I don't even know

43:33.219 --> 43:36.564
because of the condition I was in
if he even stuck his weenie in me.

43:37.724 --> 43:41.319
Well, it's still criminal sexual conduct

43:41.436 --> 43:43.279
any way you look at it.

43:43.396 --> 43:45.148
If we can prove it.

43:45.273 --> 43:46.820
Horoscope.

43:46.941 --> 43:49.114
Time to get your financial ass in order.

43:49.235 --> 43:51.454
Don't be putting off making your will.

43:51.571 --> 43:54.040
Put in it whoever's
been most loyal to you.

43:54.157 --> 43:56.330
Whoever cleans up your messes.

44:01.539 --> 44:03.541
Tricky Dick.

44:14.135 --> 44:16.103
Oh, shit.

44:35.281 --> 44:37.124
Hmm.

44:53.132 --> 44:55.760
Mr. Ricks' residence.

44:55.885 --> 44:58.388
Let me speak to him, please.

44:58.513 --> 45:01.733
Mr. Ricks can't be disturbed.
Want to tell me who's calling?

45:01.849 --> 45:05.228
I want to tell him I'm
sorry about his brother.

45:05.353 --> 45:08.232
I want to tell him it was an accident.

45:08.356 --> 45:09.198
What was?

45:09.315 --> 45:11.693
His brother getting blown up.

45:11.818 --> 45:16.198
I want to tell him I hope the
same thing doesn't happen to him.

45:16.322 --> 45:17.699
I can tell him that.

45:17.824 --> 45:19.952
But I want to make sure he understands.

45:20.076 --> 45:24.627
If you tell him, you're
taking quite a responsibility.

45:24.747 --> 45:25.748
Don't you think?

45:25.873 --> 45:28.376
How much you looking to get?

45:29.710 --> 45:31.212
One million.

45:31.337 --> 45:33.590
Can you remember to tell him that?

45:33.714 --> 45:35.182
I believe so.

45:35.299 --> 45:38.098
Would that be cash or
would you take a check?

45:38.219 --> 45:40.563
You want to play?

45:41.597 --> 45:45.227
In about two minutes,
you'll hear the way I play.

45:45.351 --> 45:48.571
It's gonna roar in your fucking
ears so you don't forget.

45:48.688 --> 45:52.363
Hey, it's cool. I'll tell him.

45:57.488 --> 45:59.536
Shit.

46:20.178 --> 46:21.600
Sgt. Downey.

46:21.721 --> 46:24.270
And this is Sgt. Mankowski.

46:24.390 --> 46:27.439
We understand you were at
a party at the home

46:27.560 --> 46:30.530
of Mr. Woodrow Rickslast Friday evening.

46:30.646 --> 46:32.444
Was it Friday?

46:32.565 --> 46:34.283
Yeah, I guess it was.

46:34.358 --> 46:38.784
So do you recall meeting
a Greta Wyatt there?

46:38.905 --> 46:42.409
I wasn't really introduced to anybody.

46:43.910 --> 46:48.666
So the only person
you remember is Mark Ricks?

46:48.789 --> 46:50.757
And his brother, of course.

46:50.875 --> 46:55.346
You're not Nicole
Robinette, by any chance?

46:55.463 --> 46:58.091
I'm afraid so.

46:59.050 --> 47:02.145
Do you remember a Greta
Wyatt going upstairs?

47:02.261 --> 47:05.435
I don't know who Greta Wyatt is.

47:07.016 --> 47:09.110
You got a lot of books.

47:09.227 --> 47:11.229
Get much time to read?

47:11.354 --> 47:13.197
Never enough.

47:13.314 --> 47:17.069
Really? Not even while
you were incarcerated?

47:19.528 --> 47:21.997
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

47:22.114 --> 47:24.162
Don't want to talk about old times?

47:24.283 --> 47:26.331
Maybe fill us in on how you got busted?

47:26.452 --> 47:28.454
I don't want to talk
to you about anything.

47:28.579 --> 47:30.297
Okay? Now leave.

47:30.414 --> 47:32.883
Don't say another word.
Just get the fuck out.

47:33.542 --> 47:34.794
Listen to this.

47:34.919 --> 47:37.092
It says, "You have a sense

47:37.213 --> 47:39.762
of inner and outer harmony.

47:39.882 --> 47:42.601
This would be a perfect day

47:42.718 --> 47:45.221
to take singing lessons.

47:45.346 --> 47:47.394
You may have talent."

47:47.515 --> 47:49.483
What do you think?

47:49.600 --> 47:53.070
Well, yeah, if we have the time.

47:53.187 --> 47:57.408
We got us a couple of
more pressing matters

47:57.525 --> 47:58.572
come up.

47:58.693 --> 48:01.242
First thing, we need to find somebody

48:01.362 --> 48:03.410
that knows how to get
a bomb out of the pool.

48:03.531 --> 48:06.751
How did a bomb get in the pool?

48:07.702 --> 48:09.375
Let's come back to it.

48:09.495 --> 48:11.418
We also have a matter
of this lady who called,

48:11.539 --> 48:14.418
said she gonna blow you up if
you don't give her some money.

48:14.542 --> 48:16.920
Call the police.
They'll take care of it.

48:17.044 --> 48:19.672
I'm afraid of what she might do.

48:20.506 --> 48:22.725
You know, like she
might be a crazy woman

48:22.842 --> 48:24.389
and it'd set her off.

48:24.510 --> 48:27.889
Well, how much does she want?

48:29.640 --> 48:32.735
Yeah, she said like $2 million,

48:32.852 --> 48:33.728
cash money, no checks.

48:33.853 --> 48:36.697
Get it from the bank and have it ready.

48:37.523 --> 48:39.116
Yeah, she said have it ready.

48:39.233 --> 48:40.075
You know, like in a box.

48:40.192 --> 48:44.413
So then when she phones again and tells
us the time and place she wants it,

48:44.530 --> 48:47.534
you're supposed to give it
to me and I'll deliver it.

48:48.534 --> 48:50.161
Did we learn anything?

48:50.286 --> 48:53.039
She won't be any help
to us for the assault.

48:53.164 --> 48:56.464
Yeah, I did learn that much.

48:56.584 --> 48:58.086
Can I make a suggestion?

48:58.210 --> 49:00.212
Tell Wendell to get a
judge to sign a warrant

49:00.338 --> 49:02.306
so you can come over
here and search the place.

49:02.423 --> 49:04.391
What are you looking for? Bombs?

49:04.508 --> 49:07.102
Explosive materials and literature.

49:07.219 --> 49:09.722
Also there's a little red notebook.

49:09.847 --> 49:12.350
She covered it up with papers
while you were talking to her.

49:12.475 --> 49:15.479
Well, you know you're
in a legal grey area.

49:15.603 --> 49:16.729
You can get into a lot of trouble

49:16.854 --> 49:19.824
pretending you're still on active duty.

49:19.940 --> 49:22.443
Or I could crack the case.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.912
I guess it's how you look at it.

49:25.029 --> 49:27.407
Put this down.

49:29.533 --> 49:31.456
I want...

49:31.577 --> 49:34.501
to cross Mark out.

49:34.622 --> 49:37.592
Cross out Mark.

49:38.793 --> 49:40.841
Mr. Woody, you understand

49:40.961 --> 49:42.463
the lawyer knows who
to take out of the will.

49:42.588 --> 49:47.014
What we have to do is tell
him who you want to go in.

49:47.134 --> 49:52.857
Hmm.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.318
Hmm.

49:59.438 --> 50:02.658
You know, what I used to believe

50:02.775 --> 50:05.574
was that...

50:05.694 --> 50:08.493
red things

50:08.614 --> 50:11.663
were best for hangovers.

50:11.784 --> 50:15.379
And a really bad hangover,

50:15.496 --> 50:19.171
I'd chug a bottle of ketchup.

50:21.627 --> 50:23.095
I got to hand it to you.

50:23.212 --> 50:24.509
The notebook validates her motive.

50:24.630 --> 50:27.634
She blames the Ricks
boys for turning her in.

50:28.676 --> 50:30.849
You're having fun being
suspended, aren't you?

50:30.970 --> 50:33.223
Except for the pay, yeah.

50:33.347 --> 50:35.520
Do two things for me.

50:35.641 --> 50:37.063
Don't impersonate a cop.

50:37.184 --> 50:40.108
And don't tell me what you're doing.

50:40.229 --> 50:42.152
Unless I get something good.

50:42.273 --> 50:44.275
That goes without saying.

50:45.359 --> 50:47.407
Whatever you say.

50:47.528 --> 50:49.451
Hey, wait.

50:49.572 --> 50:51.540
Take a minute.

50:52.700 --> 50:55.544
See if you think this guy knows anything

50:55.661 --> 50:57.880
about setting bombs.

51:01.292 --> 51:02.714
You smoke?

51:02.835 --> 51:05.588
Who the fuck are you?

51:06.589 --> 51:08.591
Sgt. Mankowski.

51:08.716 --> 51:09.808
Mankowski.

51:09.925 --> 51:11.893
You're the last one
seen my man Booker alive.

51:12.011 --> 51:15.481
Listen, why don't you just
tell us who set the bomb?

51:15.598 --> 51:19.023
Just step outside and my
man get blown up by hisself.

51:19.143 --> 51:21.362
If it don't mean shit to you,

51:21.479 --> 51:23.732
then it don't mean shit to me.

51:25.483 --> 51:28.453
Why the fuck are we
even talking about it?

51:35.284 --> 51:38.538
You know what I
think I'm going to do?

51:39.705 --> 51:42.049
What's that?

51:42.166 --> 51:44.544
Get married.

51:46.170 --> 51:49.800
You have to be in love,
Mr. Woody. It's the law.

51:51.717 --> 51:53.594
No, I'm serious.

51:53.719 --> 51:57.269
I mean, not right away.

51:57.389 --> 51:59.016
No. But soon.

51:59.141 --> 52:02.020
And there's someone I like already.

52:02.144 --> 52:03.236
The blonde.

52:03.354 --> 52:05.072
You mean the one that
says you raped her,

52:05.189 --> 52:07.658
wants to take you to court
and have you thrown in jail?

52:07.775 --> 52:09.994
The tall one. The one
with the shaved bush.

52:10.110 --> 52:13.410
Has, huh? You didn't tell me that.

52:13.531 --> 52:15.829
Ginger.

52:15.950 --> 52:18.203
She the one, huh?

52:18.327 --> 52:20.580
I'm in love with her.

52:20.704 --> 52:22.706
And...

52:22.831 --> 52:25.710
I could put her in the will.

52:27.753 --> 52:28.970
You could.

52:29.088 --> 52:32.592
But let's see if you have
anybody closer to you.

52:32.716 --> 52:34.639
I can't think of anybody.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.683
Go through the alphabet.

52:36.804 --> 52:41.401
A, B, C, D...

52:42.476 --> 52:43.853
You know anybody you like,

52:43.978 --> 52:46.231
name starts with a D, Mr. Woody?

52:47.773 --> 52:49.320
You know, I was
supposed to wear glasses.

52:49.441 --> 52:52.661
We're talking about Ds, Mr. Woody.
Come on, let's see who we have.

52:52.778 --> 52:55.657
I think, what do I need
to wear glasses for?

52:55.781 --> 52:58.284
I can see all right.

52:58.409 --> 53:01.333
But that's why I do not want to

53:01.453 --> 53:03.672
take singing lessons.

53:03.789 --> 53:06.417
I thought of somebody, Mr. Woody.

53:06.542 --> 53:07.759
Who?

53:07.876 --> 53:09.002
Myself.

53:09.128 --> 53:12.428
I would be proud to be in your will.

53:12.548 --> 53:14.346
Oh, yeah, well, you're
gonna be in the will.

53:14.466 --> 53:18.437
I said you know somebody that starts
with a D, you didn't say nothing.

53:18.554 --> 53:23.151
Well, I was waiting
for you to get to the L.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.603
Damn. You way ahead of me, huh?

53:25.728 --> 53:29.733
You know, what I've been thinking was...

53:29.857 --> 53:32.736
I want to write a novel.

53:33.611 --> 53:37.741
And I can dictate it to you
like we're doing right now.

53:40.159 --> 53:41.832
Shit.

53:45.247 --> 53:46.419
Hi, Donnell.

53:46.540 --> 53:48.542
We're not interrupting anything, are we?

53:48.667 --> 53:50.635
I mean, if Mr. Woody's
ï¬‚oating in the pool,

53:50.753 --> 53:53.427
- we can always come back.
- No, he's not ï¬‚oating today.

53:53.547 --> 53:56.642
He'll be glad to see
you. Come on in. Come in.

54:00.012 --> 54:02.936
Mr. Woody, look who come to see you.

54:03.057 --> 54:05.901
It's Ginger and that nice police officer

54:06.018 --> 54:07.770
come around collecting again.

54:07.895 --> 54:10.648
Boy, oh, boy.

54:10.773 --> 54:13.697
Ginger, is that you?

54:14.860 --> 54:17.283
Sit down and have a drink.

54:17.404 --> 54:19.657
Donnell.

54:24.662 --> 54:27.632
Is that the
same one with the shaved bush?

54:27.748 --> 54:29.625
Yes, that's right.

54:29.750 --> 54:32.003
I'm gonna need to have
a word with you, officer.

54:32.127 --> 54:35.131
Mr. Woody here will fix Ginger up.

54:35.255 --> 54:38.930
He's got a bar there
with a fridge in it.

54:39.802 --> 54:42.055
I wasn't fine with Mr.
Woody last time I was here.

54:42.179 --> 54:44.807
Are you gonna behave yourself?

54:44.932 --> 54:46.354
Boy, oh, boy.

54:46.475 --> 54:47.772
Come with me.

54:47.893 --> 54:50.612
I got something that's
gonna interest you.

55:25.514 --> 55:28.814
All I want to
know is how much you want.

55:28.934 --> 55:31.437
How much I want for what?

55:31.562 --> 55:33.940
To clean the pool.

55:42.072 --> 55:42.914
10,000.

55:43.031 --> 55:44.999
And if Woody stops payment on the check,

55:45.117 --> 55:47.540
I'll put the bomb back in the pool.

56:01.633 --> 56:02.976
Do you-

56:04.928 --> 56:07.807
do you like Busby Berkeley?

56:27.409 --> 56:29.878
That's some mean-looking shit.

56:30.496 --> 56:33.670
Yeah, but somebody did a
half-assed job of rigging it.

56:33.791 --> 56:37.045
The screw wasn't set in
tight enough to the clock.

56:38.879 --> 56:40.881
You knew it, didn't you?
You look at that shit

56:41.006 --> 56:44.510
lying at the bottom of the pool,
you knew it wasn't going off.

56:44.635 --> 56:48.185
That's why people like me like
to get hired by people like you.

56:51.683 --> 56:52.525
What did he say?

56:52.643 --> 56:55.943
You'll never believe this.
He asked me to marry him.

56:56.063 --> 56:58.236
- Oh, come on.
- I'm not kidding.

56:58.357 --> 57:00.826
I said, "Let's just
settle this and I'll leave.

57:00.943 --> 57:03.412
There's no way in the
world I'd ever marry you."

57:03.529 --> 57:05.327
Just tell him you want the money.

57:05.447 --> 57:08.917
- I feel sorry for him.
- What does that mean?

57:09.034 --> 57:11.662
Okay, well, can't I feel sorry for him?

57:13.330 --> 57:15.753
I guess if you want to.

57:15.874 --> 57:17.968
Well, I didn't get a marriage proposal,

57:18.085 --> 57:20.463
but I didn't do too bad.

57:20.587 --> 57:23.887
10 grand for cleaning out his pool.

57:25.676 --> 57:29.021
Maybe I can take you to a
nice place for dinner tonight.

57:38.689 --> 57:39.941
When I called today,

57:40.065 --> 57:42.193
did you have any idea who it was?

57:42.317 --> 57:44.240
Yeah, I knew.

57:44.361 --> 57:46.204
You did not.

57:46.321 --> 57:48.198
Girl, I'm being nice to you.

57:48.323 --> 57:50.417
How long I can manage is something else.

57:50.534 --> 57:51.831
See, I have to get back home soon

57:51.952 --> 57:55.297
in case Mr. Woody wake up in the
dark and don't know where he at.

57:55.414 --> 57:58.213
Did you present my demands to Woody?

57:58.333 --> 57:59.835
Yeah, I presented your demands.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.883
I'm trying to think
of what Mr. Woody said.

58:02.004 --> 58:04.006
I think he said, "Oh, really?"

58:04.131 --> 58:05.007
Something like that.

58:05.132 --> 58:07.180
Well, obviously the bomb didn't go off.

58:07.301 --> 58:10.851
If it would have, it would
have been on the news.

58:10.971 --> 58:13.144
We have to trust each other.

58:14.099 --> 58:16.022
You and I have had some good times

58:16.143 --> 58:16.985
over the years, haven't we?

58:17.102 --> 58:19.981
- Remember when we- -
Girl, I ought to tell you.

58:20.105 --> 58:22.904
That wasn't the last time
I had any pussy, understand?

58:23.025 --> 58:23.992
I've had some since then.

58:24.109 --> 58:26.487
Now you the one that called me.

58:26.612 --> 58:28.489
Let me tell you what I feel about this.

58:28.614 --> 58:29.991
The kind of vibes I get.

58:30.115 --> 58:33.710
A person that sends bombs,
they into heavy shit.

58:33.827 --> 58:34.999
What I see you doing,

58:35.120 --> 58:37.964
you thinking how you can
use me being on the inside.

58:38.081 --> 58:40.925
You not thinking of favoring
me unless it helps you.

58:41.043 --> 58:42.716
We both make out.

58:42.836 --> 58:44.383
I'm gonna tell you something.

58:44.504 --> 58:47.929
There's a dude who
knows what you're doing.

58:48.050 --> 58:49.017
Who is he?

58:49.134 --> 58:51.228
Name's Mankowski.

58:51.345 --> 58:53.814
I know him. He's a cop.

58:53.931 --> 58:57.026
Used to be. They suspended
his ass. Threw him out.

58:57.142 --> 59:00.191
But he keeps coming around,
know what I'm saying?

59:00.312 --> 59:02.861
Comes by with his hand out.

59:02.981 --> 59:05.029
The man's looking to score.

59:05.150 --> 59:07.118
That's only the one problem.

59:07.235 --> 59:09.488
I see another one.

59:10.781 --> 59:13.079
Do you freaky deak?

59:13.200 --> 59:15.498
Girl, you crazy.

59:15.619 --> 59:17.417
Mmm.

59:38.684 --> 59:40.652
What's the other problem?

59:40.769 --> 59:42.771
I see too many people.

59:44.189 --> 59:45.862
Like my partner?

59:45.983 --> 59:48.077
What I'm telling you,

59:48.193 --> 59:51.868
I don't see cutting it three
ways when we don't need to.

59:53.365 --> 59:55.367
That's what you're worried about?

59:55.492 --> 59:56.584
Fine.

59:56.702 --> 59:58.921
You get half of a two-way split.

59:59.037 --> 01:00:01.131
Yeah? And how do you
expect the man to pay you?

01:00:01.248 --> 01:00:04.377
- Cash?
- That's one way.

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:08.046
You dumb as shit.

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:10.094
We could actually get paid by check?

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:13.560
- There's a way.
- He could stop payment.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.975
I said there's a way to do it.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:19.396
Yeah?

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:23.145
But I get a million, you get less.

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:25.568
Whatever you want.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:28.033
Right on, baby.

01:00:34.489 --> 01:00:37.368
Monday morning, as
soon as the bank opens,

01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:38.914
Woody calls the trust department

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:42.540
and transfers 1.7 million
to the commercial account.

01:00:42.664 --> 01:00:46.168
So we just hold a gun up
to his head? Is that it?

01:00:46.293 --> 01:00:47.715
That's crazy.

01:00:47.836 --> 01:00:50.180
He can just cancel
the check right after.

01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:53.892
Not if he's dead, he can't.

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:56.721
I suppose if you decide
to cut Donnell out,

01:00:56.845 --> 01:00:59.974
we just place a nice
explosive and the two of them

01:01:00.098 --> 01:01:03.193
get buried under a pile
of rubble, is that right?

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:05.438
Now there's an idea.

01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:09.320
But the cops are gonna know that
he signed a check over to us.

01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:10.943
One of our names is gonna be on it.

01:01:11.068 --> 01:01:15.995
The check is going to be made out to
- are you ready?

01:01:16.114 --> 01:01:18.663
Nicole Robinette.

01:01:19.284 --> 01:01:22.254
Woody doesn't know it
yet, but he's buying

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:25.419
motion picture rights
to both of my novels.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:28.840
Commander, how are you?

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.333
Hello.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.298
Robin, it's Skip.

01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:09.292
Robin, what's the matter?

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:13.342
- Who is this?
- I just told you, it's Skip.

01:02:28.728 --> 01:02:31.231
Hello.

01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:33.450
Hi, it's Chris Mankowski.

01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:35.569
You just called, didn't you?

01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:36.946
And you hung up on me.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:40.324
Tried to call you back, but you
must have been talking to Skip.

01:02:40.448 --> 01:02:41.791
- Who?
- Skip.

01:02:41.908 --> 01:02:46.084
You know, the guy you went down
with for blowing up the car.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.668
Hang up and call Donnell this time.

01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:53.295
If he hasn't already told you about me,

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.263
ask him
- Mankowski.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.601
Well, if you are going
to be downtown later,

01:02:59.718 --> 01:03:02.437
I'll meet you at the Hart Plaza Bar.

01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:17.490
- Hello.
- Robinzl need a favor.

01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:18.282
Okay.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:21.247
We need to send that nosy
cop on a little vacation.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.914
Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I will do it.

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:28.665
But right now I'm doing something else.

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.308
Wake up, Mr. Woody.

01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:48.434
I finished typing your new will.

01:03:49.976 --> 01:03:54.698
Sign it and then we can go for a swim.

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.342
"I, Woodrow Ricks,

01:04:21.466 --> 01:04:23.889
being of sound mind and body,

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:26.138
wish to leave at least $5 million

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:28.391
to my best friend Donnell Lewis

01:04:28.515 --> 01:04:30.609
if and when I ever die."

01:04:30.725 --> 01:04:35.071
Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy.

01:04:39.818 --> 01:04:40.364
Yes?

01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:44.661
- It's juicy. -Juicy Mouth,
tell me what you've been doing.

01:04:44.781 --> 01:04:45.998
I'm in a bad mood.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.335
Motherfuckers in homicide
had me sitting in a closet

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.373
asking the same shit over and over.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:51.496
I got a man for you
need to be vamped on.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.589
What do you charge to break his leg,

01:04:53.707 --> 01:04:56.381
- put him in the hospital about a month?
- No, I'm tired.

01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:59.425
Take you two minutes from the
time he steps out of his Caddy.

01:04:59.546 --> 01:05:03.346
Polack name Mankowski.
Not near as bad as you.

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.388
Mankowski?

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:07.433
Shit, I know that
name. That man's a cop.

01:05:07.554 --> 01:05:10.398
That man messed up with Mr. Woody.

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:15.362
Got his ass suspended. Ain't
got a badge or a gun no more.

01:05:16.354 --> 01:05:18.402
<i>- Took his gun,
huh? - Mm-hmm.</i>

01:05:18.523 --> 01:05:20.821
That's the motherfucker
let Booker blow hisself up.

01:05:20.942 --> 01:05:23.991
I thought that was you
and Moselle did that.

01:05:24.112 --> 01:05:25.580
I wasn't there, you understand?

01:05:25.697 --> 01:05:29.747
He was there. He let
my man blow hisself up.

01:05:29.868 --> 01:05:31.586
Yeah, I'll bust his legs good.

01:05:31.703 --> 01:05:36.334
- Uh,just the one.
- I'll get you a deal for the same price.

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:37.254
I'll put his ass away.

01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:40.379
Juicy, how much for just the one leg?

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:43.131
Hey, let me get a cold one.

01:05:49.095 --> 01:05:51.268
Damn it.

01:05:53.892 --> 01:05:57.066
So, where's Robin?

01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:02.367
We ever met, you and I?

01:06:02.484 --> 01:06:05.613
Nope. First time.

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.574
Well, I got to ask.

01:06:11.242 --> 01:06:13.586
How did you make me?

01:06:15.747 --> 01:06:19.377
Well, Skip, I know
you're not a cardiologist.

01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:20.673
Right?

01:06:20.794 --> 01:06:23.468
- Maybe it's the ponytail.
- Damn.

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:26.592
Maybe you just look dirty.

01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:28.764
Where's Robin?

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:31.263
Right about now she-

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.516
she's across the street
in that parking lot

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.893
just sitting there in her red bug.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:46.612
Hey, Sgt. Mankowski.

01:06:46.945 --> 01:06:49.789
Want to see why they
call me Juicy Mouth?

01:06:52.117 --> 01:06:53.619
Do I have to?

01:06:55.787 --> 01:06:57.789
Okay, put it back.

01:06:58.873 --> 01:07:02.719
This the motherfucker let
Booker blow hisself up.

01:07:04.462 --> 01:07:08.638
And you're the motherfucker that
was supposed to be guarding his body.

01:07:09.342 --> 01:07:12.846
That ain't nice talk.
Make it easy on you.

01:07:12.971 --> 01:07:13.847
No fuss, stick your leg out,

01:07:13.972 --> 01:07:18.068
put your foot on the bumper of
that car, we'll be done and gone.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:20.402
You want to break my leg?

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.319
Listen, I told the person I'd do more,

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.282
but he said, "Nah.

01:07:24.399 --> 01:07:28.279
Don't put him away.just put
him in the hospital awhile."

01:07:28.403 --> 01:07:30.371
What person are we talking about?

01:07:30.488 --> 01:07:31.535
Can't tell you that, man.

01:07:31.656 --> 01:07:33.784
Kind of like how a
lawyer won't tell you shit

01:07:33.908 --> 01:07:34.784
on how he knows shit.

01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:37.753
Check it out, it's the same
thing is what I'm saying.

01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:41.501
This motherfucker is just
like an attorney, man.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:48.681
See it?

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:53.637
See that?

01:07:57.098 --> 01:07:59.772
Man, you ain't supposed
to have that thing.

01:08:03.438 --> 01:08:06.533
This is the part where you fellas run.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:09.619
I'm gonna count to two.

01:08:09.736 --> 01:08:10.578
One...

01:08:17.118 --> 01:08:19.541
Two.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.622
Juicy.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:57.207
Who is it that wants my leg busted?

01:08:57.325 --> 01:09:01.171
It's Donnell, right?

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.421
Are you pretending you're invisible?

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:10.595
All right.

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:11.965
I need an answer.

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:15.765
So I'm gonna show you
what Clint would do, okay?

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:31.572
Okay!

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.167
Juicy. Juicy!

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.802
It was Donnell, right?

01:09:59.262 --> 01:09:59.979
Say it.

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:02.815
It was him.

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:06.273
You know, you could have just told me.

01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:08.738
Saved me from having
to fuck up your car.

01:10:08.855 --> 01:10:12.826
What, this? It's not my car.

01:10:20.825 --> 01:10:22.122
I can't sleep.

01:10:22.243 --> 01:10:24.416
Maybe a drink will help.

01:10:27.874 --> 01:10:28.716
Hey, partner.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.756
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar!
How'd you get in here?

01:10:30.877 --> 01:10:32.720
It wasn't hard.

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.180
- Was it?
- Mm-mmm.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:36.516
You want to tell me
what you're doing here?

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:39.056
We're here because you fucked up.

01:10:39.177 --> 01:10:40.099
Wait now.

01:10:40.219 --> 01:10:42.688
First I got to run upstairs

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.648
and get the man settled
with his nightcap.

01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:47.727
Bring our stuff in.

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:51.607
- All of it?
- We're going to use it, aren't we?

01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:56.035
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:09.545
Your boy Skip's kind of
an outpatient, is he not?

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:10.758
- Yeah.
- Whoa, hey, hey!

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:13.253
- Don't bring that shit in here!
- It won't hurt you.

01:11:13.378 --> 01:11:14.630
All we need is a place to stash it,

01:11:14.754 --> 01:11:17.473
and by Monday morning
I promise it'll be gone.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.803
You have a gun in the house?

01:11:21.928 --> 01:11:22.770
Come on.

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.731
Put that shit in the garage.

01:11:29.769 --> 01:11:30.691
Oh, yeah, this is good.

01:11:30.812 --> 01:11:34.066
This stuff needs a cold,
dry place. Highly volatile.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:36.739
Whoa, Jesus! Sorry.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:40.614
Put that shit over by my golf shoes.

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:45.831
Easy does it. Easy.

01:11:45.952 --> 01:11:47.920
Okay.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.335
Okay, that's good.

01:11:50.456 --> 01:11:52.834
All right, let's go.

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:56.922
Boom!

01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:04.770
A gun, sweetheart?

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.764
Used to have one. Didn't need it.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.812
Too bad. Could have used it.

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:11.186
- You want to know why?
- Tell me.

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:14.109
Your buddy the cop is
gonna come looking for you.

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:17.951
Kids you sent to do
a job on him blew it.

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:21.867
Good night.

01:12:21.988 --> 01:12:24.537
Oh.

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:28.206
- Hi, this is
Greta Wyatt. - Hey-

01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:29.499
If you leave your name
and number, please,

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.793
after you hear the beep,
I will get back to you.

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:34.258
Greta, hi, it's Chris.

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:36.628
Listen, I really need to talk to you.

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:38.972
Good morning. I was listening.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.386
I was hoping it was you.

01:12:41.507 --> 01:12:42.383
Um, hey.

01:12:42.508 --> 01:12:44.510
Tried to call you earlier,
but nobody picked up.

01:12:44.635 --> 01:12:48.560
You changed your message on your
little answer thing there, huh?

01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:51.025
I think I may be
retiring Ginger La Nova.

01:12:51.142 --> 01:12:54.521
You know there's nothing
wrong with Greta Wyatt, right?

01:12:54.645 --> 01:12:57.899
Look, can we get together later tonight?

01:12:58.024 --> 01:12:59.446
They found my car. I've
got to go pick it up.

01:12:59.567 --> 01:13:01.786
And then I've got to take
care of something at Woody's.

01:13:01.903 --> 01:13:04.372
- But I'll call you after.
- Sounds good.

01:13:04.489 --> 01:13:07.368
- Chris.
- Hmm?

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.584
I miss you.

01:13:13.998 --> 01:13:15.545
Miss you, too.

01:13:15.666 --> 01:13:18.010
Um, stay put, okay?

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.846
I will.

01:13:25.009 --> 01:13:27.262
Morning.

01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:32.104
Woody, hi.

01:13:37.021 --> 01:13:39.274
Oh, you don't remember me?

01:13:40.525 --> 01:13:42.573
Oh.

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:45.121
Oh, Robin.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:50.710
How much do you need?

01:13:51.744 --> 01:13:53.542
Let's celebrate.

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:57.292
Donnell, get some food for later.

01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.589
Mr. Chinaman.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.929
We don't need Donnell.

01:14:10.054 --> 01:14:11.556
What'd you bring him in for?

01:14:11.681 --> 01:14:13.900
I don't know. I thought
it was a good idea.

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:16.815
Did you decide where you're
gonna put the dynamite?

01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:19.189
Soon as I figure that
out, it'll be easy.

01:14:19.313 --> 01:14:21.190
Look, as soon as Donnell gets back,

01:14:21.315 --> 01:14:23.192
why don't you take him to
the bathroom or someplace?

01:14:23.317 --> 01:14:25.240
You do what you're good at,
I'll do what I'm good at.

01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:27.864
Maybe we'll get lucky
and pull this thing off.

01:14:27.989 --> 01:14:30.993
Luck has nothing to do with it.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.458
Do you believe this guy?

01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:43.967
Beautiful.

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:45.965
Well, while you were
upstairs getting laid,

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:49.014
I was down here taking care of
the stuff you asked me to do.

01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:50.478
So can I have my piece of candy, mama?

01:14:50.595 --> 01:14:52.768
- Where'd you put it?
- Don't worry about it.

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:55.108
But you're gonna love how it works.

01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:11.036
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

01:15:11.157 --> 01:15:11.999
Well, you here now.

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:14.210
I just want to talk to Woody a minute.

01:15:14.327 --> 01:15:16.125
I want to give him back his check.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.839
Well, he's right there. Go ahead.

01:15:18.956 --> 01:15:21.505
Mr. Woody. Look who come to see you.

01:15:21.626 --> 01:15:23.299
Over this way, Mr. Woody.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:25.012
Look, it's Ginger.

01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:28.724
I should have called. I'm sorry.

01:15:28.841 --> 01:15:31.390
- I have to go.
- Oh, he's waving to you.

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:33.558
Better get out of the pool, Mr. Woody.

01:15:33.679 --> 01:15:35.647
You're gonna be all
wrinkled like a prune.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.187
Might as well make yourself
comfortable, sweetie.

01:15:37.308 --> 01:15:39.982
- You want something to drink?
- Okay, one drink, please.

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:43.072
I bet I know what she'd like.

01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:44.782
Yeah.

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:52.290
<i>Chris, hi.</i>

01:15:52.406 --> 01:15:54.033
I was thinking.

01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:55.580
I don't want Woody's money.

01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:58.796
It feels gross. I'm gonna
give him back his check

01:15:58.913 --> 01:16:01.462
and call off the
wedding. That was a joke.

01:16:01.582 --> 01:16:03.926
Anyway, you said you
were going over there,

01:16:04.043 --> 01:16:07.013
so I guess I'll see you in a little bit.

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:10.133
<i>Oh, no, no, no. Shit.</i>

01:16:14.637 --> 01:16:16.890
Perceiving
it with ultraviolet

01:16:17.014 --> 01:16:19.358
- or perceiving it with sonar.
- Flying?

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:23.275
It would be dark if you were a
person and then you were a bat.

01:16:23.396 --> 01:16:24.067
Mm-hmm.

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:26.941
You'd see the same
thing that a person would see,

01:16:27.066 --> 01:16:29.990
- but you'd be a bat.
- You would.

01:16:30.111 --> 01:16:31.078
Oh, good one.

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:35.826
When you're saying
speaking, like, technical.

01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:54.719
A different perceptive element.

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.438
So if you visualize that,

01:16:57.555 --> 01:17:00.149
you'd be perceiving this,

01:17:00.266 --> 01:17:02.610
but you'd be a bat.

01:17:07.565 --> 01:17:09.067
Where's Greta?

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.114
You mean Ginger?

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.237
Oh, she out there.

01:17:17.408 --> 01:17:19.285
Greta.

01:17:19.952 --> 01:17:23.172
What's wrong with you?
What did they give you?

01:17:23.289 --> 01:17:25.166
She fell in the pool.

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:27.134
- She tripped.
- She tripped.

01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:29.925
Yeah, shit, that's what
she did. She tripped.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:32.140
- She tripped.
- You gave her acid?

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:34.304
I didn't give her anything.

01:17:34.425 --> 01:17:36.143
Skip did.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.184
Hey, no, it was only a half of one.

01:17:39.305 --> 01:17:40.522
She wanted it. Ask her.

01:17:40.639 --> 01:17:42.141
Did you tell her what might happen?

01:17:42.266 --> 01:17:44.940
She's fine. Don't worry
about it. Don't sweat it, man.

01:17:45.061 --> 01:17:46.313
It's all goo
- ah!

01:17:46.437 --> 01:17:47.814
That wasn't bad.

01:17:47.938 --> 01:17:49.110
You slipped it to her, didn't you?

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.950
Ask her how she feels.
Go ahead, ask her.

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:54.070
- Ask her.
- Don't fucking move.

01:17:54.195 --> 01:17:56.163
Are you gonna take that from him?

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.954
Will you just stay out
of it, for Christ's sake?

01:18:03.704 --> 01:18:04.546
How do you feel?

01:18:04.663 --> 01:18:07.337
I'm just a little tired. That's all.

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:10.086
Did he tell you what he was giving you?

01:18:10.211 --> 01:18:11.383
I don't know.

01:18:11.504 --> 01:18:14.678
He just gave me a drink and he said...

01:18:16.217 --> 01:18:17.969
I don't know what he said.

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:20.062
Sit tight. You're gonna be okay.

01:18:20.179 --> 01:18:22.147
We'll be out of here soon, okay?

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:27.316
Come on, officer. You need
to get that edge taken off.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:28.562
Man, have a drink.

01:18:28.687 --> 01:18:30.906
Have a seat by your Ginger.

01:18:31.023 --> 01:18:33.446
Robin will read you something
that'll enlighten you,

01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:37.322
while I go throw this in the trash.

01:18:43.494 --> 01:18:45.542
Shit.

01:19:05.224 --> 01:19:07.352
We're still okay.

01:19:13.023 --> 01:19:14.821
What to do?

01:19:14.942 --> 01:19:18.367
Leave the motherfucking house.

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:30.125
I come back from Mr.
Chinaman, I don't lock it.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.253
Motherfucker.

01:19:34.044 --> 01:19:35.921
Motherfucker.

01:19:36.046 --> 01:19:37.548
You're conspiring
to extort money.

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:40.847
The only difference is you're doing
it with paper instead of a bomb.

01:19:40.968 --> 01:19:43.016
All right, what's the problem?

01:19:43.137 --> 01:19:46.437
Think it'll be contested?
Fine, let's wait and see.

01:19:46.557 --> 01:19:49.310
It's done. I want to
get this party started.

01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:51.563
Catch!

01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:55.233
- Skip.
- Now give me your gun.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.735
Come on, you're not serious.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.204
Deadly.

01:20:01.614 --> 01:20:04.413
Give me your gun.

01:20:06.952 --> 01:20:09.000
Easy. Robin.

01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:12.671
- Take his gun.
- Let me have it.

01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:17.046
It's big.

01:20:17.171 --> 01:20:20.300
Now you are gonna
be spending the night tonight

01:20:20.424 --> 01:20:23.553
so we don't have to worry about you.

01:20:25.012 --> 01:20:26.980
Now, in the morning,

01:20:27.097 --> 01:20:28.974
fine, you can leave.

01:20:29.099 --> 01:20:30.601
No problem.

01:20:31.936 --> 01:20:34.439
This how you do it?

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:40.487
Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:20:48.327 --> 01:20:51.797
Anyway, I thought
it would be a good idea

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:55.384
if we could get Burt to
recreate one of his stunts

01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:56.252
for our viewers.

01:20:56.377 --> 01:20:57.594
- Good idea.
- Hey, Burt.

01:20:57.711 --> 01:21:01.056
Burt. Ladies and
gentlemen, Burt Reynolds.

01:21:01.173 --> 01:21:03.392
Say, listen, knowing how you
do all your own stunts-

01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:06.058
<i>- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, I know you do.</i>

01:21:06.178 --> 01:21:08.601
We just saw them and they're great.

01:21:08.722 --> 01:21:11.225
And I thought it'd really
be nice if you could recreate

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:14.274
- some of them for us tonight.
- I'd be glad to.

01:21:14.395 --> 01:21:17.319
They come here, they
have a box of dynamite.

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.362
I make them put it in the garage.

01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:23.829
I go there and it's gone.

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:27.662
The Mercedes is locked,
the keys are gone,

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:30.081
and the lights are out.

01:21:32.162 --> 01:21:33.755
Did you ask Skip about this?

01:21:33.872 --> 01:21:35.966
What, asking how he's gonna blow me up?

01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:38.336
I know he placed it somewhere.

01:21:39.753 --> 01:21:43.508
Stay out of the garage.
Probably be all right.

01:21:44.883 --> 01:21:46.601
How would he work it?

01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:48.437
Where's Robin and Skip?

01:21:48.554 --> 01:21:50.227
In the kitchen, mostly.

01:21:50.347 --> 01:21:53.851
When you drive in and out, do
you use a garage door opener?

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:57.446
Yeah, little thing with the
button you push to open it.

01:21:57.563 --> 01:21:59.281
Yeah.

01:21:59.398 --> 01:22:03.653
My guess is they put the
charge in the Mercedes,

01:22:03.777 --> 01:22:06.405
wire it to the door opener.

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.532
They bring us all into the garage,

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.661
go out the other way,
and drive off in the VW.

01:22:11.785 --> 01:22:13.662
Robin presses the button,

01:22:13.787 --> 01:22:14.879
boom, no witnesses.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:18.422
We gonna get
put in the garage, huh?

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:22.342
I ain't gonna let Mr. Woody get killed.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:26.054
Well, glad to hear you say that.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:28.269
Not this soon.

01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:30.558
What was your cut?

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:34.149
I'm not in this deal.

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:37.861
You mean not anymore, you're not.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:40.861
Look, we may not have a gun,

01:22:40.981 --> 01:22:43.951
but I'll tell you what we do have.

01:22:44.068 --> 01:22:47.242
That is, if you haven't
thrown it out yet.

01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:49.240
What do we have?

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.493
Five sticks of American dynamite

01:22:51.617 --> 01:22:53.540
in a black bag.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.038
And you the bomb man.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.059
You're having fun, aren't you, Robin?

01:23:09.176 --> 01:23:11.850
Not as much fun as I'm gonna have.

01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:14.689
Bank's about to open. It's showtime.

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:17.188
Morning, honkies.

01:23:17.309 --> 01:23:20.529
All right, Mr. Woody, time
for your Groovy Berries.

01:23:20.646 --> 01:23:23.650
Oh, what about

01:23:23.774 --> 01:23:25.868
"Let's Make a Deal"?

01:23:25.984 --> 01:23:28.078
You early this morning.

01:23:28.195 --> 01:23:30.573
Monty don't come on till after a while.

01:23:30.697 --> 01:23:33.246
All right, Donnell, it's time.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.543
00.

01:23:35.661 --> 01:23:37.789
Humor me.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:43.548
All right, Mr. Woody.
Time to transfer the money.

01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:46.343
Oh, yeah?

01:23:46.463 --> 01:23:47.806
Okay.

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.225
Matt Stove, good morning.

01:23:50.342 --> 01:23:52.185
- Matt, how you doing?
- Hey, Donnell.

01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:54.054
Good morning. How was your weekend?

01:23:54.179 --> 01:23:58.229
Don't have time to chat this
morning. Here's Mr. Ricks.

01:23:59.852 --> 01:24:01.525
Mr. Ricks?

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:03.818
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi, Mr. Ricks.

01:24:03.939 --> 01:24:06.067
- How are you?
- Groovy.

01:24:06.191 --> 01:24:07.568
So Donnell tells me
we're making a transfer.

01:24:07.693 --> 01:24:10.242
- I guess we are.
- Yes, we are, sir.

01:24:10.362 --> 01:24:12.285
As fast as possible.

01:24:12.406 --> 01:24:15.080
Here's Donnell.

01:24:16.076 --> 01:24:17.202
- Okay, Matt.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:17.327 --> 01:24:19.204
Mr. Ricks will be
transferring two million

01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:21.423
from the trust account to the company.

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.588
- That's it.
- Right away, Donnell.

01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:25.552
Thank you.

01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:29.014
Shadooby! Whoo! Yahoo!

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:30.974
All right, now that that's done,

01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:33.719
we're gonna move the two of
you right on into the garage.

01:24:33.844 --> 01:24:35.016
Get you out of our
hair. Come on, let's go.

01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:39.017
All right, Skip, Robin, why don't
you just lay your guns on the counter?

01:24:39.141 --> 01:24:40.859
- Excuse me?
- I like your spunk.

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:42.603
- Heavy.
- Do you believe it?

01:24:42.728 --> 01:24:45.607
It's from the dick handbook.
He's supposed to say that.

01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:46.903
All right, I gave you a chance.

01:24:47.024 --> 01:24:48.571
You don't want to take
it, that's up to you.

01:24:48.692 --> 01:24:50.569
How about I give you a chance
to get in the fucking garage?

01:24:50.694 --> 01:24:53.538
- How about that?
- Let's just stick to the script.

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:56.499
You go get the check, I
take them to the garage.

01:24:56.617 --> 01:24:57.834
- It'll be easy.
- Amen.

01:24:57.951 --> 01:25:00.579
Robin, you're not gonna make it.

01:25:02.372 --> 01:25:04.090
I'll be right back.

01:25:05.417 --> 01:25:07.966
All right. Two of you with me.

01:25:08.086 --> 01:25:10.635
Going to the garage. Come on.

01:25:10.756 --> 01:25:11.598
Hey, hey.

01:25:11.715 --> 01:25:14.764
Why'd you say she ain't gonna
make it? What's gonna stop her?

01:25:16.386 --> 01:25:19.640
Five sticks of American powder.

01:25:19.765 --> 01:25:21.642
Five sticks?

01:25:21.767 --> 01:25:23.735
In a black bag.

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:29.233
In the desk by the checkbook.

01:25:30.317 --> 01:25:32.615
You're just trying to
fake me out, aren't you?

01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:35.740
How would you know how to wire a charge?

01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:42.746
I guess nobody told you.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:47.126
My friend here was on the bomb squad.

01:25:50.754 --> 01:25:52.756
Shit. Robin!

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:54.975
Hey! Hey! Wait!

01:25:55.092 --> 01:25:57.845
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:00.769
Don't! Robin, no!

01:26:01.765 --> 01:26:04.735
Say to me don't say
nothing. You had to tell him.

01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.025
You want Skip with us or with Robin?

01:26:08.146 --> 01:26:10.444
Maybe we should just leave.

01:26:10.566 --> 01:26:11.658
Wait a minute.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:13.906
That will I spent all
that time getting Mr. Woody

01:26:14.027 --> 01:26:16.450
to sign is in that damn desk.

01:26:21.702 --> 01:26:23.124
Robin!

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:25.794
No, no! Don't! Don't!

01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:42.431
Hey.

01:26:42.556 --> 01:26:45.560
I know you.

01:27:29.269 --> 01:27:30.566
You haven't done anything.

01:27:30.687 --> 01:27:32.655
Been getting bids on the work.

01:27:32.773 --> 01:27:34.741
Don't have one yet that pleases me.

01:27:36.193 --> 01:27:38.537
Bet there's still some of Robin in here.

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:40.998
Man, she was all over the place.

01:27:41.114 --> 01:27:44.539
But, hey, didn't Skippy
say something to you?

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:45.707
Yeah, he opened his eyes.

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:50.253
Could barely hear him, but I
believe his last words were,

01:27:50.374 --> 01:27:53.048
"Aw, shit."

01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:55.045
Man got what he deserved.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:56.968
How you doing with Ginger?

01:27:57.089 --> 01:27:59.467
Greta and I are getting
an apartment in the county.

01:27:59.591 --> 01:28:03.095
They gave me my badge back. I'll
be going to work in homicide.

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:05.393
You're not being investigated?

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:09.144
Wendell did say they'd
be asking why I was here

01:28:09.267 --> 01:28:10.439
at the house armed.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.607
So you have to explain

01:28:11.728 --> 01:28:14.982
why a laid-off cop is walking
around with a piece, huh?

01:28:15.107 --> 01:28:17.451
Like, what was your intent?

01:28:17.567 --> 01:28:21.492
Well, I kept it at work.
Never used it on the job.

01:28:22.447 --> 01:28:23.915
Hmm.

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.710
Tell 'em you were taking it home
and happened to have it on you.

01:28:32.082 --> 01:28:32.799
That's not bad.

01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:35.760
You want to get ahead, you
have to learn to think devious.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:39.927
Of course, that could
get you into trouble.

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:42.600
Or get you off the hook.

01:28:42.718 --> 01:28:45.597
All depends on how you
look at it, brother.

01:28:57.816 --> 01:28:59.739
Boom!

01:29:19.963 --> 01:29:22.432
Honkies.

01:29:36.897 --> 01:29:39.150
But you got the money.

01:29:39.274 --> 01:29:41.493
Oh, am I happy you're happy.

01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:44.409
After all that...

01:29:49.868 --> 01:29:52.872
Well, it looks like things
aren't too bad after all.

01:29:52.996 --> 01:29:55.465
Because you have $900.
