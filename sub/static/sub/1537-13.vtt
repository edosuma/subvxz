00:01.331 --> 00:02.431
Hey, Boyle,

00:02.432 --> 00:04.279
I need a recommendation
for a good restaurant.

00:04.280 --> 00:07.170
It's Marcus' birthday
and I want to do something...

00:07.171 --> 00:08.304
Nice.

00:08.305 --> 00:10.804
Ooh. Do you want like,
classic, romantic?

00:10.805 --> 00:13.295
- Or gastro-sensuous?
- Ugh. Never mind.

00:13.296 --> 00:15.643
I know those categories.
You guys are talking dates.

00:15.644 --> 00:16.705
Here's what you do:

00:16.706 --> 00:18.730
Invite him over,
order some fancy take out,

00:18.731 --> 00:20.907
throw it in a pot,
and act like you cooked it.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.615
I got the idea
from yahoo! Answers.

00:22.616 --> 00:25.051
Dude, I'm not gonna buy a pot.
We're not married.

00:25.052 --> 00:26.919
<i>Mm-kay,
you know what time it is?</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:31.023
Because my hoodie does.

00:31.024 --> 00:32.158
Look at that.
Mm.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.060
I have either two
or four words for you.

00:34.061 --> 00:35.228
Drag queen.

00:35.229 --> 00:36.213
Dim sum.

00:36.229 --> 00:38.131
You're talking
about this friday night?

00:38.132 --> 00:39.532
Everything's gonna be booked.

00:39.533 --> 00:41.167
We're only 72 hours out
and we're still

00:41.168 --> 00:42.168
in the brainstorming phase?

00:42.169 --> 00:43.169
You gotta postpone.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.071
You can't postpone
a birthday, Amy.

00:45.072 --> 00:46.906
But, if you can't get a
reservation,

00:46.907 --> 00:48.975
you can always go home
and shampoo his hair.

00:48.976 --> 00:51.110
Please stop
always recommending that.

00:51.111 --> 00:52.445
Well, it's always romantic.

00:52.446 --> 00:54.580
You can go to the top
of the empire state building,

00:54.581 --> 00:55.915
that's every romantic.

00:55.916 --> 00:57.683
Hm. Maybe I will.

00:57.684 --> 00:59.519
You can pee on the whole city
from up there.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.653
Come on!
What? Come on!

01:23.860 --> 01:25.878
This stupid machine
won't take my dollar.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.859
That's half a dollar
taped to a pizza coupon.

01:27.860 --> 01:30.225
It's good for a cheesy bread
worth $2.50.

01:30.241 --> 01:32.652
You would've made money
on this deal, machine.

01:32.653 --> 01:34.253
Hey, sarge,
can I borrow a dollar?

01:34.254 --> 01:36.289
No. No more loans.

01:36.290 --> 01:38.257
You already owe me
way too much.

01:38.258 --> 01:40.059
The bank of Terry
is closed.

01:40.060 --> 01:41.694
What, are you sailing away
on a tugboat?

01:41.695 --> 01:43.500
Man, I love tugboats.

01:43.501 --> 01:44.564
It's not a tugboat!

01:44.565 --> 01:45.932
I'm locking the vault!

01:45.933 --> 01:47.834
All right, fine, how much
could I possibly owe you?

01:47.835 --> 01:49.036
50, 60 bucks?

01:49.052 --> 01:51.508
$2,437.

01:51.509 --> 01:52.605
Dollars?

01:52.606 --> 01:53.740
Wait, of course dollars,
why was that the part

01:53.741 --> 01:54.941
I was surprised by?

01:54.942 --> 01:59.224
Jake, I would appreciate it
if you paid me back.

01:59.225 --> 02:02.014
Well, that's the craziest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

02:02.015 --> 02:03.716
"I would appreciate it
if you paid me back"?

02:03.717 --> 02:05.685
Good.
So you heard it too.

02:05.686 --> 02:06.686
I've been in debt
to him forever

02:06.687 --> 02:08.086
and he's never cared before.

02:08.088 --> 02:09.389
Something's up.

02:09.389 --> 02:10.656
I'm gonna drop everything
and figure out

02:10.657 --> 02:11.864
why he's acting weird.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.196
Or you could just pay him
what you owe.

02:13.197 --> 02:14.100
[Laughs]

02:14.101 --> 02:15.401
Hilarious, Rosa.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.802
[Continues laughing]

02:16.803 --> 02:19.154
Hilarious.

02:19.155 --> 02:22.858
Santiago, whenever you can,
please drop of those case files.

02:22.859 --> 02:24.193
You got it, partner!
Be right in!

02:24.194 --> 02:25.194
"Partner"?

02:25.195 --> 02:26.195
What is going on?

02:26.196 --> 02:27.429
Is this a make-a-wish thing?

02:27.430 --> 02:28.731
Are you dying?

02:28.732 --> 02:30.266
Is it from loneliness?

02:30.267 --> 02:32.468
I found a mistake in one
of the Captain's old cases

02:32.469 --> 02:34.270
and he asked me to work
it with him.

02:34.271 --> 02:35.838
As partners.

02:35.839 --> 02:37.940
We're taking our relationship
to the next level.

02:37.941 --> 02:40.809
From awkward underling
to awkward colleague.

02:40.810 --> 02:43.279
This is a real ugly duckling
story.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.614
We're gonna bounce ideas
off each other,

02:45.615 --> 02:48.050
eat street meat while we
stake-out some perp,

02:48.051 --> 02:49.618
bond over burned coffee...

02:49.619 --> 02:50.619
Santiago!
Hm?

02:50.620 --> 02:51.620
Now means now!

02:51.621 --> 02:52.621
You got it.

02:52.622 --> 02:54.062
See? He can't wait
to work with me.

02:54.063 --> 02:55.852
He's clearly pumped.

02:55.868 --> 02:57.229
Hello, Terry.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.934
I just thought I'd stop by
and let you know

02:58.935 --> 03:00.135
that I'm on my way
to the bank.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.817
That's right.

03:01.833 --> 03:05.070
I'm gonna pay you back
because I know your secret.

03:05.086 --> 03:06.608
What are you talking about?

03:06.609 --> 03:07.609
I don't have a secret.

03:07.610 --> 03:08.610
Oh, really?

03:08.611 --> 03:09.778
Fact the first:

03:09.779 --> 03:11.380
After years of not caring
about my debt,

03:11.381 --> 03:13.669
you weirdly want me
to pay you back now.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.842
That implies to me
that there is a sudden,

03:15.843 --> 03:17.719
unexpected expense.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.555
Or I got sick of waiting
for you to do the right thing.

03:20.556 --> 03:21.644
Not plausible.

03:21.645 --> 03:23.922
You have endless patience
for my shenanigans.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.081
Fact the second:

03:25.082 --> 03:27.950
You've had dentist appointments
twice in the past two weeks.

03:27.951 --> 03:29.952
No one goes to the dentist
that much.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.805
I haven't been
in seven years.

03:31.821 --> 03:33.693
You should go
to the dentist, Jake.

03:33.694 --> 03:36.292
Probably.
My teeth hurt all the time.

03:36.293 --> 03:37.493
Fact the third:

03:37.494 --> 03:39.262
I'm really liking this
"fact the" thing.

03:39.263 --> 03:40.263
I think I'm gonna stick
with it.

03:40.264 --> 03:41.264
Fact the fourth:

03:41.265 --> 03:43.286
I found this on your desk.

03:43.287 --> 03:44.567
It's a list of names.

03:44.568 --> 03:46.669
Nathaniel Jeffords,
Alexa Jeffords...

03:46.670 --> 03:47.970
Those are my cousins names.

03:47.971 --> 03:49.071
Lies!

03:49.072 --> 03:50.706
There is but one conclusion.

03:50.707 --> 03:53.493
You, Terry Jeffords,
are pregnant.

03:53.509 --> 03:55.298
The names are baby names.

03:55.299 --> 03:56.946
The dentist?
An obstetrician.

03:56.947 --> 04:00.149
And the money
is for baby things.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.222
Like diapers.

04:02.223 --> 04:04.720
What are you talking about, man?

04:04.721 --> 04:05.855
Yeah.

04:05.856 --> 04:07.757
That is crazy.
Yeah.

04:07.758 --> 04:09.125
Damn it!

04:09.126 --> 04:10.126
Does anybody else know?

04:10.127 --> 04:12.862
No, just you, and your wife,
and crash.

04:12.863 --> 04:14.130
That's what I think
you should name the baby.

04:14.131 --> 04:15.652
Works for a boy
or a girl.

04:15.653 --> 04:17.266
Listen up, Jake.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.868
We just found out
Sharon is pregnant

04:18.869 --> 04:21.269
and it's way too early
to tell anyone.

04:21.271 --> 04:23.372
This is a secret.

04:23.373 --> 04:25.374
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.375
Do you?

04:26.376 --> 04:27.510
Do you understand me?

04:27.511 --> 04:29.457
Oh, this got physical
very quickly.

04:29.458 --> 04:31.481
This is adult stuff, Jake.

04:31.482 --> 04:32.682
Be serious!

04:32.683 --> 04:34.016
Look, I promise
I won't tell anyone, all right?

04:34.017 --> 04:35.051
My lips are sealed.

04:35.052 --> 04:36.252
Good.

04:36.253 --> 04:38.091
Do I even weigh
anything to you?

04:38.092 --> 04:38.955
No.

04:38.956 --> 04:41.357
It's like holding
a couple of grapes.

04:41.358 --> 04:43.835
Okay, partner,
let's bang this out.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.194
Should we grab
a cup of coffee,

04:45.195 --> 04:46.596
bounce some theories
off each other...

04:46.597 --> 04:47.892
I solved it already.

04:47.893 --> 04:49.499
Oh...

04:49.500 --> 04:51.601
Then should we grab
a cup of coffee,

04:51.602 --> 04:52.702
you could tell me
what you found out and...

04:52.703 --> 04:53.903
No, we can do it here.

04:53.904 --> 04:55.838
The fires were set by
Richard Wilcox,

04:55.839 --> 04:57.507
the firefighter who was
first on the scene

04:57.508 --> 04:58.903
at all three fires.

04:58.904 --> 05:01.210
Okay uh, now we just
have to work backwards,

05:01.211 --> 05:02.512
figure out why...

05:02.513 --> 05:04.856
He was up for a promotion
and wanted to look like a hero.

05:04.872 --> 05:05.681
Yup.

05:05.682 --> 05:08.051
But how are we gonna find
this bastard?

05:08.052 --> 05:09.085
After all these years,
you know, it could take...

05:09.086 --> 05:10.119
He owns a store.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.220
I have the address.

05:11.221 --> 05:12.889
Okay.

05:12.890 --> 05:13.990
I could drive.

05:13.991 --> 05:15.659
No, you don't know
where we're going.

05:15.675 --> 05:18.061
But if you'd like
a cup of coffee,

05:18.062 --> 05:20.263
there's an old bakery
in that neighborhood.

05:20.264 --> 05:21.531
The coffee there is terrible

05:21.532 --> 05:24.400
but I would enjoy the nostalgia.

05:24.401 --> 05:26.269
I love terrible coffee.

05:26.270 --> 05:28.037
Now let's put away
Richard Wilcox,

05:28.038 --> 05:29.673
that no-good punk.

05:29.689 --> 05:30.924
He's 86 years old.

05:31.080 --> 05:36.479
You don't outgrow punk, sir.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.068
There you are, sergeant.

05:38.069 --> 05:39.949
Installment one of TBD.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.751
1,200 bucks, that's everything
I have.

05:41.752 --> 05:43.553
You should also note
it's all in singles

05:43.554 --> 05:47.035
because it takes so many bills
to fill up a briefcase.

05:47.036 --> 05:48.257
Thanks, Peralta.

05:48.258 --> 05:50.760
You know, it's nice
to finally have someone

05:50.761 --> 05:52.428
to share this secret with.

05:52.429 --> 05:53.822
I'm pregnant, man!

05:53.838 --> 05:55.498
Yeah!
We're pregnant.

05:55.499 --> 05:57.800
"We" because I convinced you
not to get a vasectomy.

05:57.801 --> 05:59.736
So if it wasn't for me,
you'd have no penis.

05:59.737 --> 06:01.437
You still don't know
what a vasectomy is.

06:01.438 --> 06:02.772
Hey, so listen,
I was thinking,

06:02.773 --> 06:05.675
now that I've proven I'm
fiscally responsible,

06:05.676 --> 06:09.504
how you feel about me
being the godfather?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.214
How about this?

06:11.215 --> 06:12.915
You don't tell anyone
about the pregnancy

06:12.916 --> 06:16.177
for four weeks, and I'll think
about you being the godfather.

06:16.193 --> 06:17.086
Yes!

06:17.087 --> 06:19.155
Oh also, I put a list
of baby names in there.

06:19.156 --> 06:20.857
My favorite: Nakatomi.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.158
After the tower in <i> Die Hard.</i>

06:22.159 --> 06:23.626
Works for a boy or a girl.

06:23.627 --> 06:25.228
What's going on?

06:25.229 --> 06:26.396
How'd you get all that money?

06:26.397 --> 06:28.097
Pfft, by putting bad guys
behind bars.

06:28.098 --> 06:30.333
I work for a living, jeez.

06:30.334 --> 06:32.122
I emptied out my checking
account.

06:32.123 --> 06:33.803
Wait, you've owed Terry
for years,

06:33.804 --> 06:37.106
and now, suddenly, you give him
every penny you have?

06:37.107 --> 06:39.409
- Why?
- Why?

06:39.410 --> 06:41.811
Oh, wait.
Because.

06:41.812 --> 06:43.012
That is not an answer.

06:43.013 --> 06:48.184
No. Well, because you guys
got in my head

06:48.185 --> 06:49.585
about owing Terry money.

06:49.586 --> 06:50.687
And it convinced me
that it's important

06:50.688 --> 06:52.055
to pay back your friends.

06:52.056 --> 06:53.289
Well, you owe all of us money.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.024
So does that mean you're gonna
pay all of us back?

06:55.025 --> 06:56.926
Yeah, Jake,
or is there something special

06:56.927 --> 06:58.094
about your friendship
with Terry?

06:58.095 --> 06:59.095
Nope.

06:59.096 --> 07:00.096
Nothing special about Terry.

07:00.097 --> 07:01.397
I'm gonna pay everyone.

07:01.398 --> 07:03.533
Man, I really hoped to say
this to a drug dealer

07:03.534 --> 07:06.069
who killed my whole family,
but...

07:06.070 --> 07:07.904
It's payback time.

07:10.794 --> 07:15.937
All right, but a nice little
dent into my Terry debt.

07:15.938 --> 07:16.938
No applause?

07:16.939 --> 07:18.006
<i>Seriously?</i>

07:18.007 --> 07:19.574
Okay, I see how this is gonna
be.

07:19.575 --> 07:20.975
All right, how much do I owe
the rest of you?

07:20.976 --> 07:22.877
$4,009.

07:22.878 --> 07:24.646
