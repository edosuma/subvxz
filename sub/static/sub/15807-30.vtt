    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.206 --> 00:07.272
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.341 --> 00:09.742
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:09.810 --> 00:11.776
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:11.845 --> 00:14.379
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailing man ¶

00:14.448 --> 00:16.615
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:16.684 --> 00:19.118
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.186 --> 00:21.420
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.489 --> 00:24.523
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.592 --> 00:26.224
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.293 --> 00:28.160
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.229 --> 00:30.729
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:30.797 --> 00:32.998
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.067 --> 00:35.066
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.135 --> 00:37.769
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:37.838 --> 00:40.405
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:40.474 --> 00:42.407

      desert isle ¶

01:20.013 --> 01:22.013
Skipper, you sure we'll
      finish the signal platform

01:22.082 --> 01:23.581
before the navy ships go by?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.317
Gilligan, according
to the radio report

01:25.385 --> 01:27.419
the navy will hold their
maneuvers day after tomorrow.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.987
Yeah, they are gonna
            go right by here.

01:29.056 --> 01:32.991
Exactly. We'll build a signal
fire, they'll come and rescue us

01:33.059 --> 01:34.493
because I would've
given 'em semaphore.

01:34.561 --> 01:35.560
Oh, yeah.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.562
Now keep busy,
get some more vines, Gilligan.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.598
- Yes, sir. Aye, aye.
     - Thank you.

01:50.177 --> 01:51.877
[thud]

02:04.725 --> 02:07.159
Skipper? Skipper, what
          are you doin' on here?

02:07.227 --> 02:08.961
You're supposed to
            be up there working.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.129
No napping. Wake up.
            Come on, Skipper.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.365
Mm, must have fainted
           from exhaustion.

02:13.434 --> 02:17.435
Skipper? Mm, hm,
      I hate to do this, but, uh

02:17.504 --> 02:19.804
somebody ought to
               finish our work.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.607
So..

02:26.013 --> 02:27.346
Here goes.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.649
[spluttering]

02:37.557 --> 02:39.391
What happened up?
               I'm soaking wet.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.359
It was a flash storm,
it's all over now.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.362
Oh, thanks. Wait a minute,
      who are you?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.298
Who am I?
That's pretty funny.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.167
- Wh-what and who am I?
    - Who are you?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.502
Skipper, you are
the Skipper, Skipper.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.539
Skipper?
                   Skipper, who?

02:53.607 --> 02:57.075
Skipper, do you feel alright?
I mean, you okay?

02:57.144 --> 02:59.477
Will you stop
             calling me Skipper?

02:59.546 --> 03:02.447
- Where am I?
        - Where are you?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.516
If you don't know where you are,
I'm not gonna second guess you.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.319
I better go get the Professor.
He's very good, who's who.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.666
Hey, Professor?
        Hey, Professor.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.768
Something really terrible has
 happened to the Skipper.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.537
I was vining picks
   so we could finish signals

03:25.605 --> 03:27.539
and semaphore the navy.
    And when he..

03:27.608 --> 03:29.707
- See, see?
- Skipper, you're just in time.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.410
I think something's wrong
with Gilligan.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.944
Who's Gilligan?

03:33.012 --> 03:34.980
It's me. Don't you remember
  your little buddy?

03:35.049 --> 03:37.215
- I don't have any buddy.
   - Why is he wet?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.717
I threw water on him. This
 happened when he took his nap.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.387
- Maybe he's sleepwalking.
   - I see.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.990
Skipper, you and I ought to
have a little talk.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.458
But who are you?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.093
What do you mean?
       I'm the Professor.

03:48.162 --> 03:51.696
- Is something wrong with you?
 - Oh, I feel fine.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.399
But...why do you keep
   calling me "The Skipper?"

03:54.468 --> 03:56.000
(Professor)
 'Because you are the Skipper.'

03:56.069 --> 03:57.969
Don't you remember the Minnow
 and how we got lost at sea

03:58.038 --> 04:02.440
and shipwrecked on this island?
Doesn't any of this ring a bell?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.276
Not even a tinkle.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.310
(Professor)
          'I see.'

04:05.379 --> 04:07.011
Perhaps, you'd better sit down.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.813
Why, I don't feel tired.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.983
- Alright then, stand up.
   - Well, thank you.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.784
[chuckles]

04:15.155 --> 04:16.454
- Gilligan.
          - Yeah.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.990
I think the Skipper's
got amnesia.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.357
- An whatcha?
         - Amnesia.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.959
That's when people
can't remember anything at all.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.962
That can't be too serious,
     happens to me all the time.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.765
It's happened to the Skipper.
Keeps rubbing his head.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.533
Could you have hit him
something?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.468
No, hitting a Skipper is a court
martial offence. I'd be hung.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.105
Not if it's an accident.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.941
I remember pulling the vine,
    a pole fell, then napped.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.676
That's what must have happened.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.212
Oh, will he ever remember
       to stop forgetting?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.981
It's too early to tell. You
better take him back to his hut.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.083
I'm gonna check this out
in my medical book.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.685
Jeez, it's all my fault, huh.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.287
Never forgive myself
    unless I lose my memory.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.456
Sir? Sir?

04:51.525 --> 04:53.725
Would you mind coming
with me, sir?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.763
Right this way.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.873
You can rest here for a while.
Used to share this with a buddy.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.975
- What happened to him?
    - You won't believe me.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.344
- Sure I would.
      - He forgot himself.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.847
- I don't believe you!
     - See, I told you.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.648
Look at this,
        dust all over the place.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.451
Whoever lived here
              was a real slob.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.286
- I wouldn't say that.
     - Oh, I would.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.654
Maybe you know better.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.656
Look at this,
       socks all over the place.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.524
Look at the size
          of holes in the socks.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.993
Well, he had big feet.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.196
He should've kept them
          in his big shoes.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.631
[chuckles]

05:32.699 --> 05:34.699
Ow!

05:34.768 --> 05:36.735
What's this pile of junk
doin' on the floor?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.836
Junk? That's my
             buddy's seat chest.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.871
He has his vital
           possessions in there.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.506
[sighs]

05:42.575 --> 05:44.442
Huh, what's this a picture of?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.010
Back of a mule?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.513
No, that's my buddy
           in a football huddle.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.615
Here's his favorite hat.
      It's just about your size.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.884
Here, try it on.
                Look here, look.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.953
Look, look in
                   there. See.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.090
See, does that remind
           you of anything?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.392
- Sure does.
          - Yeah?

06:00.460 --> 06:02.127
It reminds me
I need a haircut.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.362
[laughing]

06:05.532 --> 06:07.099
(Mary Ann)
         Hi, Gilligan.
         Hi, Skipper.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.833
Howdy, ma'am.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.336
Howdy ma'am?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.904
That's a silly thing
to say, I'm not a ma'am.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.507
To the Skipper you are,
         he lost his memory.

06:15.575 --> 06:19.378
He did? Oh, my gosh!
I better tell the Professor.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.247
No, wait, I already told
        the Professor. Mary Ann.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.983
Oops! Hi, Skipper.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.251
Well, hi, beautiful.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.487
Hey, honey.
What's your name?

06:29.556 --> 06:31.622
Why, Ginger, big boy,
           what's yours?

06:31.691 --> 06:35.026
Oh, I don't care
what my name is now. Hmm.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.861
Skipper, are you alright?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.998
I'm fine and may I say, you are
a bit of alright yourself.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.568
Oh, Skipper,
that's not like you.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.403
I don't know what
               I used to be like

06:45.471 --> 06:48.139
but I like what
                 I'm right now.

06:48.207 --> 06:49.908
Oh, I know what it is.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.210
Your sailor's blood's finally
   coming to a boil, huh?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.479
It's about time.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.115
Wait a minute. I mean..
After all, you're a leader.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.550
A man above men.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.552
Well, I don't know what type
    I am, but you're my type.

07:01.621 --> 07:02.587
A-ah.
            Help me!

07:02.656 --> 07:04.389
Skipper, Skipper.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.090
What's happened
to the Skipper?

07:06.159 --> 07:08.393
Why, he's got amnesia.
   He can't remember a thing.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.229
I wouldn't say that. There are
few things he hasn't forgotten.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.764
[screaming]

07:12.833 --> 07:13.932
A-ah!

07:17.037 --> 07:18.303
We have to hurry.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.105
The navy's here and I wanna
be the first to be piped aboard.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.042
It'll be so exciting
     to set foot on water again.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.744
Skipper, I'd like you
    to meet Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.781
My! Aren't we formal today?

07:29.849 --> 07:31.716
Beg your pardon.
 What'd you say your name was?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.851
Oh, Skippy, you're playing
   games again.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.621
Mrs. Howell, this is no game.
   Skipper's lost his memory.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.490
Wonder if he could've
     left it here.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.291
It's hard to tell
       in all this mess.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.893
You think we've packed it
   in the steamer trunk?

07:41.962 --> 07:45.430
Lovey, he's lost his memory,
doesn't know who he is.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.332
Don't be silly.
He's the Captain.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.133
Aren't you the Captain, Captain?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.602
Well, I don't know
       who I am, lady.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.905
Oh, the poor man.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.840
Yes, and besides
     he's the only one who knows

07:55.909 --> 07:57.442
how to signal
               those navy ships.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.977
Oh, good heavens.

07:59.045 --> 08:02.380
Uh, Captain, you always told me
that you wanted a new ship.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.182
- I did?
      - Yes, yes, you did.

08:04.251 --> 08:08.119
If you remember who you are,
 I'll give you a 100-foot yacht.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.187
I don't know.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.488
Two hundred?

08:10.557 --> 08:11.822
I still don't know.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.392
Three hundred?
         Four hundred?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.693
Honey, there are times

08:15.762 --> 08:17.696
when financial promises
don't mean a thing.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.132
May JP Morgan have mercy
    on your soul.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.336
I'd like to try and help you, if
somebody would give me a clue.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.973
But I gave you the answer.
   You are the Skipper.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.176
If I could only believe you.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.778
I am a Skipper?

08:35.148 --> 08:37.782
So, to sum up, amnesia
  is still a medical mystery.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.918
It can last a day,
      a week or 20 years.

08:40.986 --> 08:45.189
Twenty years? Oh, we'll be
  too old to be rescued by then.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.426
There must be some cure.
 Couldn't we try alcohol rubs?

08:48.495 --> 08:50.828
We gotta cure the Captain. He's
 our friend, he's our leader.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.264
Besides, he's the only one
     who can signal those ships.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.834
However, amnesia isn't hopeless,
anything can happen.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.401
Sometimes it'll
      clear up by itself.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.972
'Sometimes a blow on the head
will snap the victim out of it''

09:04.844 --> 09:08.079
Wake up. What you say
your name was again?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.380
Gilligan, Skipper.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.016
Oh, okay,
Gilligan Skipper, can..

09:12.084 --> 09:13.551
Would you mind
if we switched hammocks?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.253
I can't sleep
on this lower one.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.988
You don't like the upper.
       You're afraid of heights.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.656
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.359
Down here feels like
I'm sinking in quicksand.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.795
Okay, let me sink, I'm lighter.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.744
[dramatic music]

09:40.813 --> 09:42.247
The coast is clear.

09:42.316 --> 09:43.782
Yes, my dear. I'm afraid it is.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.950
Oh, Thurston,
       I know you hate violence.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.019
But you said yourself
it's for the Captain's own good.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.588
I know, but it's so physical.
It's almost manual labor.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.857
Wonder if my muscles
are up to it.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.293
Of course, they are, darling.
   You're so big and strong.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.128
Come to think of it, I am.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.797
Now, remember, the Captain's
    in the bottom bunk.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.700
And it's for a good cause.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.736
- Us.
       - You're so good.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.746
[snoring]

10:17.150 --> 10:18.249
[rattles]

10:26.459 --> 10:30.395
I hate to do this, Skipper,
but it's...for your own good.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.231
[thud]

10:36.135 --> 10:37.268
Uh!

10:37.336 --> 10:38.369
Oh!

10:38.438 --> 10:40.739
What have I done?
Oh, no.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.880
Lovey, I made
             a terrible boo-boo.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.548
Gilligan's sleeping
           in the wrong hammock.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.951
Oh, you have to talk to him.
He never does anything right.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.353
I can't go back there.
      I'm emotionally exhausted.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.356
Oh, darling, you're overawed.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.924
I'll do it.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.127
Oh, no. I wouldn't hear of it.
  It's not ladylike.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.428
I won't tell a soul.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.965
I'll just close my eyes
and pretend I'm bowling.

11:07.033 --> 11:09.834
Hey, Gilligan Skipper.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.269
You're right.
        I don't like it up here.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.872
I don't like it down here
too much either.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.275
You're sure a nice guy
          for being a stranger.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.844
Would you mind switching
        the hammocks again?

11:19.913 --> 11:23.314
I wish you'd say that
when you didn't have amnesia.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.220
I don't know how you're still
almost down there.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.262
[dramatic music]

11:37.330 --> 11:39.264
[snoring]

11:49.442 --> 11:51.576
Here I go for spare.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.044
[thud]

11:54.314 --> 11:56.181
Oh! Gilligan.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.858
Now, just relax, Skipper.

12:06.926 --> 12:10.361
Just relax and concentrate
   on this shell.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.765
Just keep your eye
       on this shell.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.866
Now, Skipper,
           I want you to go back

12:15.935 --> 12:19.137
to a time before
     you were hit over the head.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.573
Swell, I'd sure like
to know who I am.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.909
Now, go back, Skipper.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.979
Go back in time
     to the good old days.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.481
'To a time before
  you were hit over the head.'

12:30.550 --> 12:32.417
'Go back, Skipper.'

12:32.486 --> 12:35.186
'Go back to the good old days.'

12:39.259 --> 12:41.359
Alright, Skipper,
      you can wake up now.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.771
Hi, kids. Ha ha.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.408
Are we gonna be late
      for school?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.977
Let's play catch.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.146
Come on, let's play
catch together.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.983
Ah, here's a good ball.
Here, Skeky, catch.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.486
- He's acting like a kid.
- Oh, he thinks we're kids too.

13:08.554 --> 13:11.523
Gee, Professor, I think you
took him back a little too far.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.792
It'll take him years
            to grow up.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.961
Now, you're
growing up, Skipper.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.598
You're no longer a little boy
playing with toy boats.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.267
The years are passing.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.436
'You're now sailing
around the world.'

13:25.505 --> 13:28.773
And you've come to an island
in the South Pacific.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.876
An island in the South Pacific.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.246
A tiny island somewhere
    in the South Pacific.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.956
Alright, Skipper,
      you can wake up now.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.097
Oh, no!

13:55.468 --> 13:58.570
I'm surrounded by the enemy!
  Help! Help!

14:16.089 --> 14:18.088
Professor, I'm too tired
        to be tired.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.724
Well, we've looked everywhere.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.992
You know, there's
            one place we missed.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.094
- Where?
  - I'm too tired to remember.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.396
I just heard the
   latest news on the radio.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.464
According to the reports
    by the navy maneuvers

14:27.533 --> 14:29.534
those ships should be passing
 here sometime this afternoon.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.803
We must be rescued
because those navy doctors

14:31.871 --> 14:33.470
will be able
to help the Skipper.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.139
Without him, who'll
             signal the ships?

14:35.207 --> 14:38.008
I grew up on the yacht. I know
something about signals.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.845
Yes. Thurston can signal
for the cocktail hour.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.514
- A third round of martinis.
 - But can he signal for help?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.116
Good heavens. After
             the third round

14:45.185 --> 14:47.318
what do you think
              I'm signaling for?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.386
You and the girls better
finish making that signal tower.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.389
Come on, Mr. Howell,
I'll get the signal flags.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.524
Alright, you come
               along too, Lovey.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.359
I'll cut some more bamboo
   for extra flags.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.994
Here, Mr. Howell,
       you take these.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.362
Mrs. Howell, you take
     this telescope.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.164
Oh, come along, Lovey.
We'll practice.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.199
We'll pretend we're back
on our yacht.

15:02.268 --> 15:03.968
Then I've to pretend
      I'm seasick.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.098
- Mary, you take this pole.
  - Okay.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.000
- And Ginger you take this here.
- Okay.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.969
Mary Ann, take your
pole, put it there.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.804
And, Ginger, put yours
over here, okay?

15:39.873 --> 15:41.839
No! Whoa!
Take it easy now.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.441
Just kinda cross, come on.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.077
What the hell?
I'll tell you what.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.012
Put your pole down, Ginger.
Put your pole down.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.648
Yeah, alright now.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.217
Mary Ann, put your pole over
there and lash it, you know.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.520
I'll go get some more vine.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.877
Alright, you two. Stop the work
and come down out of there.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.146
Well, Skipper,
    What's the matter with--

16:22.215 --> 16:24.448
Never mind all that whispering.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.952
I'm wise to all the tricks
  you Japanese soldiers pull.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.620
Japanese soldiers?

16:29.689 --> 16:32.523
He thinks we're
              Japanese soldiers.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.926
Come down out of there
     or I'll shoot.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.027
I mean it. Now move.

16:37.096 --> 16:38.162
Skipper?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.496
I'm warning you, no tricks.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.000
Make it snappy.
Move down out of there.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.843
This is the CO
of the 177th Infantry

16:52.912 --> 16:54.812
reporting
from Guadalcanal.

16:54.881 --> 16:58.482
I've been cut off from my
platoon by a Japanese patrol.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.653
But I've captured two Japanese
soldiers. Roger and over.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.722
He thinks he's back in the war.
And he thinks we're men.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.491
How could anybody
         get that idea about me?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.893
Besides having amnesia
          he's got eye trouble.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.796
Maybe, if we're a little more
friendly then we can reach him.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.266
- Good idea.
          - Skipper?

17:15.335 --> 17:19.102
You can't send messages with the
radio, it acts as a receiver.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.939
Never mind any of your tricks.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.941
Hey, how come
      you talk like that?

17:24.010 --> 17:26.209
- Like what?
     - Well, like a woman.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.212
Being born that way helps.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.482
You're one of those
      ventriloquists.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.651
You sound like a woman but you
 look like a Japanese soldier.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.423
Skipper, isn't it obvious
       that I'm a woman?

17:39.492 --> 17:42.727
That's a nice try
   but not quite good enough.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.830
Oh, Skipper, here. Sniff
this perfume just once.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.099
I told you, never mind
     with those tricks.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.635
That's probably
poisoned perfumed gas.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.337
Look at this.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.677
Do you ever see legs
            like that on a man?

18:00.746 --> 18:03.081
Well, I must say
     you're a lousy actor.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.085
[sighs]

18:10.656 --> 18:12.789
Oh, Thurston, you
       look marvelous.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.391
What was that signal for?

18:14.460 --> 18:17.661
I think it means the polo field
is clear on Sunday.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.062
Oh.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.567
'If this doesn't work out,
 I have one in reserve, Lovey.'

18:24.337 --> 18:28.038
- This one gets them every time.
- Oh, that should do it.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.675
Universal code.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.852
I got you.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.054
Hello, Skipper. What are you
  doin' with that bayonet?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.689
Never mind that,
come out of there.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.424
Yes, come down.
     I'm coming right down.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.493
Japanese soldiers
and you're my prisoners.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.061
Ha ha. Don't be ridiculous.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.330
We aren't Japanese.
             Yes, we are.

18:53.399 --> 18:56.566
Don't worry, Lovey.
             Oh! We Japanese--

18:56.635 --> 18:58.969
That's better.
Now, what's your rank?

18:59.038 --> 19:01.338
How ranky you want, ho?

19:01.407 --> 19:04.175
- Colonel?
       - Di-ya-dum-momo.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.409
G-General?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.546
Uh, sounds like,
              we strike you out.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.048
It-it sounds like, u-umpire.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.651
- Ow-do-ooo-oh-oh.
       - Em-em..

19:13.719 --> 19:15.853
- Emperor?
         - That right.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.721
- Me-me Emperor.
      - That's impossible!

19:17.790 --> 19:20.824
- He's in Tokyo.
     - Oh, no. I think big.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.860
That-that was his real child.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.529
Well, I want you to talk big.
 I want names and information.

19:25.598 --> 19:30.434
American fleet, you-you
       signal, they come ashore.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.270
- I don't believe you.
     - No, you believe him.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.073
He never lie, except
when truth don't work.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.642
- Ah-ha!
            - A-ah!

19:37.710 --> 19:39.443
Another one of those
      ventriloquists, eh?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.311
We surrender on one condition!

19:41.380 --> 19:44.281
- What's that?
      - You don't hurt us!

19:44.350 --> 19:47.852
That's a ruck!
      Now, move out. Move.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.257
Mr. Howell?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.792
Mrs. Howell?

19:56.929 --> 19:59.029
Hey, Professor,
          the girls are missing.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.330
So are Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.166
Huh, Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

20:02.235 --> 20:06.070
Mary Ann, Ginger,
               the Skipper. Huh!

20:06.139 --> 20:09.006
Professor? Professor?
     Professor?

20:09.075 --> 20:11.108
Professor? Professor?
     Pro..

20:11.176 --> 20:12.276
[screams]

20:12.344 --> 20:13.977
I thought you were
              missing too.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.614
I'm afraid there are some things
missing that's more disturbing.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.315
Our guns, ammunition,
even our radio.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.583
What do you mean?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.418
Well, using the deductive
form of reasoning

20:21.487 --> 20:23.254
taking the circumstances
as we know them

20:23.322 --> 20:25.188
projecting forward
possible conclusions

20:25.257 --> 20:26.790
it's pretty easy to say.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.526
Easy for you,
               difficult for me.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.028
I'm afraid we've done something
to make the Skipper think

20:31.097 --> 20:32.496
we're his enemies.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.331
He's probably holding
the others prisoners somewhere.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.599
We searched
               the whole island.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.402
Yes. Except for that
one place you forgot.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.504
I just remembered the place
     I forgot. Come on.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.247
See, I was right.
They're all in there.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.650
Only person I can't
see is the Skipper.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.586
Good. We better sneak in and
   free 'em before he gets back.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.821
Okay.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.194
They came.
      Get us out of here.

21:03.263 --> 21:06.397
- Shh, quiet, girls.
      - Quiet, girls.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.266
[all screaming]

21:09.335 --> 21:13.070
Put your hands up, you two.
Get over there.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.337
Ha ha.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.008
Six Japanese prisoners
in 15 minutes.

21:17.076 --> 21:20.044
I may take the whole
Japanese army single-handed.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.083
Gilligan, Gilligan,
I don't wanna worry the others

21:26.151 --> 21:27.384
but you're our only hope.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.620
Now, talk to the Skipper
like his little buddy.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.589
Okay.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.693
Hey, soldier, don't you remember
me? I'm your little buddy.

21:36.762 --> 21:39.830
I don't have any little buddy.

21:39.898 --> 21:43.266
What are you doin'
out here? Get back.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.936
Skipper, you sure you don't
 remember me, your little buddy?

21:46.005 --> 21:49.072
If you were my little buddy, why
you wearing Japanese uniform?

21:49.141 --> 21:51.008
Yeah, how come I'm
       wearing Japanese uniform?

21:51.077 --> 21:53.810
You're not wearing a Japanese
uniform. He just thinks you are.

21:53.879 --> 21:56.747
But he's got the gun,
          what he thinks counts.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.881
Look, soldier.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.450
Ac-according
    to the Geneva conference

21:59.518 --> 22:03.087
I think it's time
     for a-a coconut break.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.688
I guess there's no harm in that.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.358
Yeah, let me have the bayonet.
 I'll give it a little jab.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.561
Mr. Howell, those navy ships
may be out there right now.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.298
This calls for drastic action.
 Why don't we charge?

22:14.367 --> 22:15.900
- Can't kill all of us.
    - That's right.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.702
I'll stay here
    and tend to the wounded.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.604
We have to plan
this very carefully.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.439
This is our only chance.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.975
Oh, Professor, there they are.
 The navy ships are out there.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.478
Japanese ships, eh?

22:28.547 --> 22:30.447
Don't even sound
     an alarm or I'll fire.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.683
Skipper, Skipper,
you got to believe me.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.618
We are marooned
on a desert island

22:34.686 --> 22:37.254
and we are your friends
and you are the Skipper.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.390
You've got to forget
everything else.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.258
You are the Skipper.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.027
You are the Skipper.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.096
You are the Skipper.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.534
Alright, sailor boy,
stomach in, chest out.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.836
I won't stand
          for mutiny on my ship.

22:52.905 --> 22:56.139
- Your ship? I'm the Skipper.
- I'm the Skipper. It's my ship.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.208
- What's happened to Gilligan?
 - What's happened to Thurston?

22:58.276 --> 23:00.544
I'll report you to the Admiral
and have you court-martialed.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.346
When you talk to me,
            say, "Sir!"

23:02.415 --> 23:04.047
He thinks he's the Skipper.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.484
Everybody thinks they're
the Skipper, except the Skipper.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.352
- I'm the Skipper.
     - No, I'm the Skipper!

23:08.421 --> 23:09.953
- I'm the Skipper.
       - I'm the Skipper!

23:10.022 --> 23:11.722
[both arguing]

23:14.160 --> 23:16.160
Quiet, you prisoners, quiet!

23:18.164 --> 23:20.064
Will you prisoners be quiet?

23:20.132 --> 23:22.032
- I'm a fat very..
     - I'll put you in a..

23:22.101 --> 23:24.100
Quiet!

23:24.169 --> 23:25.970
[arguing continues]

23:30.309 --> 23:33.010
Will you be quiet?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.812
[thud]

23:36.682 --> 23:38.182
[arguing continues]

23:48.193 --> 23:52.162
Gilligan? Mr. Howell?
  What are you arguing about?

23:52.231 --> 23:54.432
Will you two pipe down?

23:56.101 --> 23:58.502
Gilligan, I'll have you know,
 I'm the only Skipper here.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.470
That goes for you too, Howell!

24:00.539 --> 24:02.472
- He knows my name.
      - Mine too!

24:02.541 --> 24:04.341
That hit on the head
      brought him back.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.643
The Skipper's cured!
      He's well now!

24:06.712 --> 24:08.212
[all cheering]

24:18.891 --> 24:20.890
(Thurston)
                 How's he doing?

24:20.959 --> 24:23.627
(Skipper)
Any signs of anything, Gilligan?

24:24.430 --> 24:26.363
[birds chirping]

24:26.431 --> 24:27.564
No signs of the ships.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.299
Boy, I really goofed this time.

24:29.368 --> 24:32.536
Don't worry, Skipper.
 It's an off season for rescues.

24:33.505 --> 24:35.239
[screams]

24:37.877 --> 24:39.142
Gilligan, you alright,
     little buddy?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.510
- A-ah.
   - What's wrong, Gilligan?

24:40.579 --> 24:43.447
Ow, what happened?
Where am I?

24:43.516 --> 24:44.848
Who are you?

24:44.917 --> 24:48.652
Oh, no.
           Not again.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.200
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:03.269 --> 25:05.301
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

25:05.370 --> 25:07.604
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:07.673 --> 25:09.739
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:09.808 --> 25:11.875
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:11.944 --> 25:13.844
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:13.912 --> 25:16.346
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:16.415 --> 25:18.348
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:18.417 --> 25:20.517
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:20.586 --> 25:22.685
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:22.754 --> 25:24.955
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:25.024 --> 25:26.824
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:26.892 --> 25:29.526
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.595 --> 25:31.628
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:31.697 --> 25:33.864
¶ For seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:33.933 --> 25:35.966
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
