01:14.992 --> 01:17.627
- Evan.
- Hey.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.382
You were out for a while. Are you hungry

01:23.500 --> 01:25.927
or thirsty or anything?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.387
I love you.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.722
I love you, too, Mom.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.896
How was work?

01:38.474 --> 01:40.858
- It was all right.
- Oh.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.736
Are you happy?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.406
Yes.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.495
Do you want to hear a joke?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.913
Sure.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.333
This shopkeeper

01:57.451 --> 02:01.254
receives flowers
at the opening of his new store...

02:02.623 --> 02:06.008
and the card says, "Rest in peace."

02:06.126 --> 02:07.677
Are you sure you're not thirsty, Ma?

02:07.795 --> 02:12.306
So he calls up the florist
angry and she says,

02:12.424 --> 02:16.853
"Sir, at least you weren't the one

02:16.970 --> 02:20.439
who got flowers at your wife's funeral

02:20.557 --> 02:24.777
that said, "Congratulations
on the new location."

02:31.652 --> 02:33.202
You need more morphine?

02:41.578 --> 02:42.795
Ma.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.302
Do you want me to call a priest?

03:04.101 --> 03:07.111
I want you to know I...

03:07.229 --> 03:09.655
think you two were amazing.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.620
And I'm grateful for everything you...

03:46.643 --> 03:49.695
Why don't you guys bury
these in your stomachs, huh?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.573
That sucked, I'm sorry.
Look, I'm gonna...

03:52.691 --> 03:54.033
I'm gonna have Shitty Carl
try to cover your shift.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.409
I'm gonna call Carl.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.253
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- Thanks, Mike.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.336
You know, Ev,
that was a real small funeral.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.964
I mean, you know, it was intimate.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.800
That's what I meant, it was good.
It was a good funeral.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.344
Yeah, they really never had
any friends or family

04:13.462 --> 04:15.429
or anything, so...

04:15.547 --> 04:16.764
Nobody else?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.394
They were only children.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.813
I mean, their parents died young.
It was just the three of us.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.315
You know, I'm really sorry about
the casket thing, too.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.402
I mean, I think I saw I had some...
some fish oil on my hands

04:29.519 --> 04:32.613
- and it... the brass was slick.
- Funerals are for the living, Tom.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.933
Why the fuck does this fucking
goddamn machine not work?!

04:36.033 --> 04:37.868
- Fuck!
- The cigarette machine is for decoration.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.829
- There's no cigarettes there.
- Give me some of that drink!

04:39.947 --> 04:41.539
Do you want a shot? Let's have a shot.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.625
- I got to work later.
- No, shots. Mike, shots, please.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.377
Whiskey, whiskey.

04:46.495 --> 04:47.545
I gotta take a piss.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.755
...some fruity faggot juice
just like you, you fuckin'...

04:49.873 --> 04:51.799
Watch where the fuck you're going, man.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.259
- I'm sorry.
- Bite me, bitch.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.679
Yeah, you're fucked up, huh?
You tryin' to roll on my bitch?!

04:56.797 --> 04:58.139
- No.
- I fuckin' saw you, man.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.641
- I wasn't.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:00.759 --> 05:02.893
Guy had a fuckin' rough day, all right?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.979
Why don't you just shut
your fuckin' cock holster,

05:05.097 --> 05:08.315
have a drink with me?
Calm down, Jesus Christ.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.989
Got a cigarette?

05:16.358 --> 05:19.076
No, I roll my own. Sorry.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.787
Hey, I got a fuckin' cigarette.
You want a cigarette? Here.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.130
- Hey, hey, what the fuck?!
- Fuck!

05:31.248 --> 05:33.632
Hey! Hey!

05:33.750 --> 05:36.969
Babe, get up! Get up!
Kick his fuckin' ass!

05:42.968 --> 05:44.018
- Get him off him!
- Fuck!

05:44.136 --> 05:46.020
- Evan, Evan, Evan!
- Fuck, that's enough, man.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.773
- All right. I'm all right!
- Babe, babe, babe.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.861
Fuckin'... Evan, Jesus Christ, brother.

05:53.979 --> 05:57.198
I mean, you knocked that stupid fuckin'
gold thing right out of his face.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.869
Are you guys fuckin' serious?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.583
Ev, I just picked up, like, fuckin' four
teeth off the goddamn ground, man.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.878
Holy shit.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.839
I mean, holy fucking shit.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.927
Here, put this on your shit.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.304
The cops were here, guys.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.514
Is he pressing charges?

06:21.631 --> 06:23.891
The psychopath? I don't know!

06:24.009 --> 06:26.060
Maybe! You almost fuckin'
murdered the guy!

06:27.387 --> 06:28.896
Will you... you're getting blood
all over your ice.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.856
Will you put the gauze
on your goddamn knuckles

06:30.974 --> 06:32.149
and then fuckin' put ice on it?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.485
Tommy, seriously, cock holster mouth?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.028
- Hey, what...
- Why would you say that?

06:36.146 --> 06:38.614
- 'Cause he had a fuckin' cockmouth.
- For fuck's sake!

06:42.152 --> 06:45.287
Look, man, you nee... you need
to change up your environment.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.958
You have a lot of shit going on,
your whole family's dead,

06:49.076 --> 06:51.961
and I think the best thing for you
would be to just shift gears

06:52.079 --> 06:53.796
and do something completely
different with yourself.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.297
Are you telling me that I'm fired, Mike?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.799
He's not saying that.
Mike, you wouldn't...

06:56.917 --> 06:58.634
I'm not saying you're fired.
I'm not saying you're fired.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.219
No, Mike, you're not saying that.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.762
But the boss was here

07:01.880 --> 07:04.807
and he said you can't work here
anymore, man. I'm sorry.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.767
I really don't want to be
unemployed right now, Mike.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.019
Look, I can bring you back.
I swear to God I can bring you back.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.521
I brought Shitty Carl back.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.356
He stabbed a goddamn
crippled guy in the leg with a fork.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.860
Right, Shitty Carl! He's a fuckin' shit.
He's a piece of shit!

07:15.977 --> 07:18.362
- I just need some time.
- Ah, fuck!

07:18.480 --> 07:19.905
I just need some fuckin' time, man.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.324
You know how it is, man.
I mean, the fucking Yelp reviews.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.744
- We're getting fucked here. I can't...
- What are you gonna do, brother?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.246
- Where did you get this?
- Evan, wait...

07:27.364 --> 07:29.331
All right, I don't need you
to fuckin' follow me home, Tom.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.292
Just hold up, man.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.835
Ev!

07:35.455 --> 07:38.549
Fuck.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.302
Dude, do you need any help
down at the boats?

07:41.419 --> 07:43.262
Can I have one of those?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.930
Yeah.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.392
I'll ask around.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.937
You should talk to Dale
about construction gigs.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.439
Dale?

07:53.557 --> 07:56.567
He's been unemployed since June, man.

07:57.262 --> 07:58.777
Give me that lighter.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.240
You want to gut fish for tourists?

08:03.358 --> 08:06.785
I mean, I smelled like a tuna fish's
asshole for four years,

08:06.903 --> 08:08.530
but it's good work.

08:08.630 --> 08:09.663
Smell that.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.332
- I don't... I don't know.
- Just smell it.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.459
- I don't know.
- It's like it's on me forever.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.170
I got some inheritance.
I can just use that.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.632
Yo, where my fuckin'
cigarette at, bitch?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.550
It's gonna get real fuckin' boring

08:21.668 --> 08:23.636
- following me around all night.
- I know where you live now, bitch.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.930
Why don't you just go back to fuckin'
East County you fuckin' tweakers?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.307
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers.
- Fuck you!

08:31.052 --> 08:34.313
Thanks for staying, man.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.775
Yeah, they'll file a police report,
they'll sue me,

08:37.893 --> 08:40.486
then they'll come back here
with baseball bats.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.529
You want me to stay? Got an extra bed?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.158
My mom's.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.204
Fuck. I mean, Ev, I love you, brother,

08:50.322 --> 08:53.749
but I'm not drunk enough to sleep
in your mom's deathbed.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.125
Yeah.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.003
Why don't you just lock the doors?
I'll call you tomorrow.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.463
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.131
- You gonna be all right?
- Yup.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.259
Yeah, you gonna be all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:05.232 --> 09:07.680
Fuck! These fuckin' things.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.015
- Am I supposed to fuckin' jump it?
- Are you fuckin' retarded?

09:10.133 --> 09:11.684
There's a hinge, man.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.485
Fuck you, man.

09:16.932 --> 09:18.440
Hey, uh... why don't you...

09:18.558 --> 09:21.026
why don't you call up somebody
for a sympathy fuck?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.237
No, I'm good, dude.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.030
All right.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.491
I'm telling you, Evan,
your mom just died.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.702
You're only gonna get
to use that one once.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.704
I love you, brother!

09:31.821 --> 09:33.914
- Love you, dude.
- I love you.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.436
Mm, condom?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.897
Okay.

10:12.396 --> 10:14.496
Handsome picture.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.958
I look like a hobo with smallpox.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.085
You know I'm only here
because I feel sorry for you,

10:20.203 --> 10:22.963
but this is a very nice picture,
Evan Russell.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.841
Thank you.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.427
- You're sitting on the condom.
- Mm, why do you have this?

10:29.793 --> 10:31.472
Are you fucking whores in TJ?

10:34.721 --> 10:38.520
What? How did you even get to that?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.273
My dad, he made me get one
'cause we were gonna go to Italy

10:41.391 --> 10:44.360
after I got back from college,
but you know what happened.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.279
How do you feel about me?

10:55.030 --> 10:57.539
I just got sober all of a sudden.
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.797
Get out of town, Evan.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.465
Right now?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.468
Yeah. My brother's a fuckup, too,
and he took a break

11:09.586 --> 11:11.970
and he went to India,
and he totally re-centered.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.973
I just worked my way up
to sous chef, though.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.643
You didn't go to Berkeley
to chop vegetables.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.521
You sound like an elitist asshole.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.816
Mm, I'm just not sober
enough for this conversation.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.642
Then let's have sex.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.719
Mr. Russell?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.311
Dispatch, I've got no one at the house.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.859
Fuck.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.951
Hi, can I get a flight somewhere?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.744
Anywhere.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.030
I'm sorry, I'm really hungover.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.667
Where would you go?
I don't know, like, uh...

12:23.785 --> 12:26.420
Canada or Europe or something?

12:27.444 --> 12:29.339
White people love Italy?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.049
Gotcha.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.719
Book me on the next flight.
Or, when is the next flight?

12:33.837 --> 12:35.929
Actually, hold on a second.
Should I go to Italy?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.848
What?

12:43.038 --> 12:45.063
What, a wizard?

12:45.181 --> 12:47.256
You're a wizard, Harry.

12:47.356 --> 12:49.506
You're a wizard.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.664
So I says to Mabel,
I says, you can't fucking put

13:43.781 --> 13:45.165
the guy on the fence like that

13:45.283 --> 13:48.126
'cause it's fucking getting
in the way of my apple trees.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.587
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, mate. Yes, bruv, what?

13:50.705 --> 13:52.965
Do you guys know where I can
find an Italian phrase book?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.592
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a bundle
of them down there, actually, pal.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.094
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.845
- Where are you from?
- California.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.472
Oh, California. What, Hollywood!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.142
- Join us for a drink, pal.
- Yeah, come on, man.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.310
Come on. Sit down. Have a drink with us.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.604
Go off and get him a drink, go on.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.065
I'm Tom. That's me pal, Sam.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.193
Sam's Welsh and he fucks sheep,
but don't worry, he's all right.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.653
You know, he won't come near your bum.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.154
- I'm not Welsh.
- Listen, mate,

14:16.272 --> 14:17.990
- you are gonna fucking love it here.
- Thanks.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.493
All you do is eat,
fucking drink, smoke weed.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.204
I lay off the scag personally, don't I?
But it's your holiday, mate.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.125
You do what you fucking like.

14:27.225 --> 14:29.459
Let's see if the Yank
can fucking keep up, eh?

14:29.977 --> 14:31.533
Boo!

14:31.633 --> 14:32.671
Look at that.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.008
Well done, bruv.

14:36.125 --> 14:40.262
Oh, my God, I wish I could
fucking talk Italian, you know?

14:41.631 --> 14:42.848
Bunch of sixes, bruv.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.018
- Sixes?
- Ciao. Ciao.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.481
Oh, he's a goddamn American hero.

14:49.581 --> 14:51.523
Oi, oi.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.191
You like me? No?

14:53.309 --> 14:56.361
No. Absolutely.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.948
Go on. Go on. Oh, my God.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.284
No, what are you doing, mate?
No, fucking hell, mate.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.619
No, you got to be more aggressive

15:03.736 --> 15:06.580
if you want to shag
an Italian bird like that, mate.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.499
What are you talking about?
What are you telling him for?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.752
At least he went up there,
but you didn't do nothing.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.629
You just don't give a little fucking...

15:14.831 --> 15:16.548
- What?
- Fucking hell.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.258
Thank you for the beer, man.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.677
Ah, you're welcome. Oh...

15:20.795 --> 15:22.638
Where are you at?
We're gonna hire a car tomorrow,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.348
go down the coast.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.558
Do you want to chip in with some petrol?

15:30.305 --> 15:32.230
Go on and get...
get a hold of that. Go on.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.066
- Come on, Evan!
- Get it fuckin' in ya!

15:34.183 --> 15:36.318
I said, "Fuck you, you cunt."
Do you remember that?

15:36.436 --> 15:40.279
I was like, "Fuck you, you cunt."
Proper cunt.

15:40.379 --> 15:41.865
I'm like, "Fuck you, you mug."

15:41.983 --> 15:43.533
Next thing you know,
I got punched in the face, mate.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.662
Woke up three days later in hospital
the cunt had fuckin' done me.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.413
He didn't help. He didn't help.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.457
He didn't help.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.334
You ever seen "8 Mile"?
You seen that movie "8 Mile"?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.961
- Yeah.
- Right? It's like that.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.254
So, geezers just rapping.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.800
And then, I swear to God, one geezer
goes... goes up on the mic, right?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.968
And he goes,
"Who can fucking battle me, blud?"

16:02.086 --> 16:04.096
All this fucking bollocks.
"Who gonna battle me?"

16:04.213 --> 16:06.181
I said, "Do you know what,
fuck this cunt. I'll fuckin' have a go."

16:06.299 --> 16:09.226
Never rapped in me life, bruv.
Never fucking rapped in my life.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.396
Went up there, mate.
Proper smashed him, mate,

16:12.513 --> 16:14.815
with a bottle in the face.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.738
Birds, eh?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.448
Fuckin' birds.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.119
I was, uh...
I was seeing this girl once.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.497
She's the love of my fucking
life, pal, you know?

17:12.615 --> 17:16.334
Known her since school,
first kiss, all that fucking shit. Yeah.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.670
Talked about having kids together,
the whole lot.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.593
And one day,

17:24.711 --> 17:27.846
she's in this pub

17:27.964 --> 17:31.725
and she meets this bloke
from Ibiza, DJ, something.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.435
Got a flat out there.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.980
She only fucking leaves me

17:37.098 --> 17:39.065
and goes and lives
with this cunt in Ibiza.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.152
Broke my fucking heart, mate.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.864
Anyway, two years later,
I'm in me local supermarket

17:45.982 --> 17:48.492
and I fucking see her there.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.660
She was proper fat.

17:50.778 --> 17:54.039
Sunburnt, skin like leather...

17:55.450 --> 17:58.794
teeth like fucking doggins,
it was disgusting. I loved it.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.133
You're lucky I'm here, pal.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.054
'Cause most men don't share
their emotions like I do.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.689
- Hey, mate, you got a Wi-Fi code?
- No, I ain't got a Wi-Fi code.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.399
You do have the Wi-Fi code, mate.
Can I just...

19:44.517 --> 19:45.734
I gave it to you last night, man.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.986
What did you do with
that little piece of paper?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.738
You fucking rolled, didn't you?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.406
You used it as a roach.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.284
Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:54.402 --> 19:57.162
Oh, bro, I fucking blazed
the fucking Wi-Fi code, mate.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.962
...because I hate all nations equally.
And I'll tell you something else,

20:06.080 --> 20:08.965
- the problem with Yanks, right?
- Yeah, everyone hates Americans.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.425
I get it. I'm an evil imperialist.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.260
You don't play rugby,
that's the problem.

20:12.378 --> 20:15.680
Well, yeah, there's that, but it's
also 'cause you're fucking loud.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.308
- You're loud. I played soccer.
- Whole nation is loud.

20:18.426 --> 20:22.112
I played soccer in elementary school
and I drink... I drink well.

20:22.230 --> 20:23.563
No, you can't.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.691
You have... I've barely seen you
drink five of those.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.444
- That's not enough for you?
- No, I'm afraid not.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.030
Fucking embarrassing
is what you are, mate.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.157
- All right.
- Oh, look at this.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.452
- All right, I'll get the next round.
- Yeah, go on, mate. Nice one.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.787
Thanks, Evan.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.047
We saw each other earlier
and if I stared any longer

20:49.165 --> 20:53.259
without saying hi,
I'd be the creepy dude gawking.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.974
Oh, shit. English?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.309
I need a drink.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.061
Well, come sit with me and my friends.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.437
Leave with me.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.775
Yeah.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.239
I have to get this round first and...

21:14.357 --> 21:18.576
I'd rather go home with you now,
but if you like boys more...

21:22.062 --> 21:23.081
Really?

21:23.199 --> 21:25.125
Come on.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.378
- What are you doing?
- Trying to have fun.

21:28.496 --> 21:31.089
Are you a prostitute?

21:31.207 --> 21:33.842
You want me to be?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.720
Are you gonna rob me?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.304
No, you look poor.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.558
Well, I'm not gonna carry drugs
up my ass for you or your boss.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.437
- Go out with me tomorrow night.
- No.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.273
- 'Cause you're a hooker.
- Because I don't date.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.736
Well, this is a fucked-up act you have,

21:52.853 --> 21:56.489
but let's say you go home with...

21:56.607 --> 21:58.742
I'd still like to grab coffee
or something sometime

21:58.859 --> 22:02.328
'cause I think you're the most
attractive person I've ever seen.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.998
But that doesn't outweigh
that you might be a mental patient

22:05.116 --> 22:07.917
and I gotta make sure you're
the kind of crazy I can deal with.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.797
You made this so much more
complicated than it needs to be.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.674
Bottle of wine tomorrow night.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.302
No... no!

22:17.420 --> 22:18.845
Maybe?

22:20.131 --> 22:21.806
Right.

22:25.034 --> 22:26.895
Oh, no.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.647
Oh, no. You fumbled.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.149
But if you're looking
for someone to play

22:31.267 --> 22:33.109
the fucking long game with
come over here, bruv.

22:33.227 --> 22:36.416
Sam will help you out.
Sam will let you fuck him.

22:36.516 --> 22:37.572
I hate these guys.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.919
- Oi!
- Hey!

22:54.457 --> 22:56.091
You went pint for pint last night, son.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.926
- I'm fucking proud of you.
- Well done, son, well done.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.719
- I did?
- Nope.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.679
Oi, we're leaving, mate.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.723
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's too expensive.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.850
We're going to Amsterdam.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.477
- All right.
- You want to come?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.438
No.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.274
All right. Good times, mate.
Good times. Good times.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.110
Yeah, take care of yourself, son.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.530
Okay.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.249
Scusa.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.255
Scusa?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.716
Um, buongiorno.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.887
Buongiorno.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.224
Um, English?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.475
A little.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.936
Is this room still available?

24:34.557 --> 24:37.483
- Have you ever work on farm?
- No.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.613
- Okay.
- Okay?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.659
Come on.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.294
You see?

24:56.412 --> 24:59.505
Hot and cold.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.132
Got it, thanks.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.849
If not hot...

25:12.094 --> 25:16.147
When cold, we cover up the trees

25:16.265 --> 25:20.693
and once a week we gather
for the olive press.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.528
The rest, I tell you.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.739
Easy, huh?

25:28.319 --> 25:30.453
Is that your wife?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.331
Yes.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.583
Is she here?

25:35.701 --> 25:38.127
Car accident.

25:40.831 --> 25:43.216
I'm very sorry to hear that.

25:54.011 --> 25:57.563
women, Jews of the world.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.108
- Jews?
- Jews.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.405
Jews.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.864
Jewels.

26:07.682 --> 26:08.883
Jewels.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.614
Buongiorno.

26:48.732 --> 26:50.366
Hey.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.577
Hey, I just moved here,
so I was wondering

26:52.695 --> 26:54.746
if that date might fall into place.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.998
- Do you remember my name?
- You never told me.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.916
- Scusa.
- You're learning.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.132
And you're not afraid to embarrass
yourself, that's good.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.759
I'm Evan.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.179
Louise. Did you just...
did you just touch my boob?

27:11.297 --> 27:13.431
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.225
- Wow.
- All right, one last time

27:16.343 --> 27:18.478
and I'll let you go.
Will you go out with me?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.229
I don't know.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.402
That's a huge cock.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.821
It's fertility imagery.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.784
No, that's... that's Roman porn.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.494
Are you an artist?

27:34.611 --> 27:35.828
No, are you?

27:35.946 --> 27:37.914
No, I was a cook,

27:38.032 --> 27:39.707
now I'm a farmer.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.793
A farmer.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.252
I just started.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.588
That was fast.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.876
Are you impressed?

27:47.976 --> 27:50.510
No. Don't... don't touch that.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.639
It's hard to make a living
in a tourist town.

27:54.757 --> 27:55.973
How do you do it?

27:56.091 --> 27:58.476
I don't. I'm a student.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.395
And how did you end up here?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.480
I'm studying evolutionary genetics.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.817
It's easier to isolate genes
in a homogeneous population.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.198
Um, I'm researching stuff here

28:12.316 --> 28:14.951
'cause not many people
have left or emigrated.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.369
I'm fucking up your job.

28:16.487 --> 28:19.914
Yes, you are. So go back
to America, fascist.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.165
Great scam you pulled

28:21.283 --> 28:23.418
having the university pay for you
to live here, though.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.295
I know, right?

28:26.413 --> 28:29.882
What do you think of her?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.844
She's hot.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.388
You think so?

28:35.506 --> 28:37.557
I need caffeine.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.696
What... what happened to your hand?

28:51.814 --> 28:55.825
Um, I punched a guy.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.286
Did it hurt?

28:58.404 --> 29:00.204
No.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.747
Yes.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.876
Did you... did you feel better?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.837
I know, I'm a child, I'm immature...

29:07.955 --> 29:10.548
I was just going to say we're all human.

29:15.170 --> 29:19.223
My family would vacation here
when I was little

29:19.341 --> 29:22.727
and I would see
these old men sitting here.

29:22.845 --> 29:26.272
Sometimes I wonder
if it's the same ones.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.441
You don't sound Italian.

29:29.810 --> 29:34.113
- Are you really from around here?
- Not far. I traveled a lot, though.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.449
So I sound weird as fuck.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.242
Did you learn your English in England?

29:38.360 --> 29:41.120
I did. But then I studied
in America for a while.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.663
- Where?
- New York.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.415
- I've never been there.
- You've never been to New York?

29:44.533 --> 29:45.583
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.335
I thought all Americans
have been to New York.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.003
- I've been to Southern California,
- Right.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.757
- Mexico, and here.
- Oh, Mexico. I love Mexico.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.926
I went there with my ex on a boat.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.511
What happened?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.471
We had so much Mexican food.

29:58.589 --> 30:01.182
- No, no, with the guy.
- Oh. Oh, he was awful.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.434
Oh, he was... he always
had to conquer something.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.670
Why did you date him, then?

30:05.770 --> 30:08.439
He wrote me very romantic love letters

30:08.557 --> 30:11.943
and he was so much fun
to drink wine with.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.070
Let's get a bottle of wine.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.866
Okay, but you have to
write me a letter first.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.787
You can write it while I finish
my espresso.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.125
I'm still jet-lagged.

31:09.243 --> 31:12.878
Flipping my days for nights is making
everything feel like I'm in a dream.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.338
Thanks for the wine.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.841
It's most of my paycheck
that I haven't gotten yet,

31:16.959 --> 31:18.092
but you're worth it.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.511
You shouldn't pay for things.

31:20.629 --> 31:25.433
What if I told you I'm actually
a successful businessman

31:25.551 --> 31:28.185
taking a break from all my wealth?

31:28.303 --> 31:29.854
Are you?

31:29.972 --> 31:31.564
I'm not.

31:31.682 --> 31:34.567
When I would sit at the bar
at the restaurant I worked at,

31:34.685 --> 31:37.778
for every one woman I'd catch
combing the place

31:37.896 --> 31:39.697
for a doctor or lawyer,

31:39.815 --> 31:43.242
I'd see like 10 of them
with some bum like me.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.828
Did you like being a cook?

31:45.946 --> 31:47.997
No.

31:48.115 --> 31:51.208
- It was fucking horrible.
- It can always be worse.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.544
And here you are, trying new stuff.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.547
I mean, I could do something
really important, still.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.009
- Like invent an app or something.
- Or get your own reality show.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.386
- The dream. The dream.
- Oh.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.432
At least you're living.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.477
Yeah, I always used to say that, too.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.395
Right now if I really had
the choice, though,

32:11.513 --> 32:14.065
I might take
professional success over living.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.399
I've worked many jobs

32:15.517 --> 32:18.819
and none of them... none...
have been worth missing life.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.449
That's very European and all,
but you know...

32:23.567 --> 32:26.911
Know what?

32:27.029 --> 32:30.081
Taking siestas and being
less competitive, that's really nice,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.041
but your iPhone
was not invented in Europe.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.251
Yeah, right. You want to go somewhere?

32:34.369 --> 32:36.420
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do it.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.014
Fuck it.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.906
We're going into that cave!

32:55.006 --> 32:56.190
- Yeah!
- No.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.901
I bet it's haunted by dead sailors.

32:59.019 --> 33:02.321
- I thought you were a scientist.
- I am a scientist.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.991
What is this "dead sailor"
bullshit ghost story?

33:06.109 --> 33:08.577
I bet you also think names
determine personality, right?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.122
- Oh, they do. All Crystals are sluts.
- Oh.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.251
Yeah!

33:15.077 --> 33:18.838
And... and Evans are nice.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.506
You do like me, then.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.966
Maybe.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.384
I know names don't determine shit.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.219
But there are still lots
of mysteries out there.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.596
Even I'm a mystery to myself.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.099
I wish I could say I wasn't just
a simpleminded dude.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.309
I understand about half of myself.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.978
- Then you're half magic.
- Mmm.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.896
I'm half undiscovered science,

33:36.014 --> 33:39.233
bunch of confusing biochemistry,

33:39.351 --> 33:42.403
and some crazy hormones.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.783
She drowned a few months ago.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.953
That's horrible.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.289
Yeah, the dams up the mountain broke.

33:53.407 --> 33:55.958
Her body was taken
out to the sea by the flude.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.669
Flood?

33:58.787 --> 34:01.213
And they found her dead body in Sicily.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.634
You know, I know it's cliché,
but all the people

34:05.752 --> 34:09.304
that put that religious stuff up?
I mean, why do they think

34:09.422 --> 34:11.474
God would do that
to a little girl like her?

34:18.098 --> 34:21.484
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause everybody's gonna die

34:21.601 --> 34:23.652
whether they believe
in God or not, right?

34:27.440 --> 34:32.036
I have this buddy... um, great guy,
always wasted, though.

34:32.154 --> 34:33.829
Not really perceptive.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.581
He goes to a party with his girlfriend,

34:36.699 --> 34:38.583
and this other girl,

34:38.702 --> 34:42.463
maybe about four feet tall,
walks up to him...

34:42.581 --> 34:46.300
punches him in the face. Knocks him out.

34:46.418 --> 34:50.054
Turns out this girl was cheating
on him with his girlfriend.

34:50.172 --> 34:54.266
So now everybody knows Tommy was
knocked out by a lesbian named Tiny.

34:56.219 --> 35:01.232
Mm, I love Tiny, but what is your point?

35:01.349 --> 35:05.069
Nothing. It's just a funny story.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.406
No.

36:37.654 --> 36:41.165
In winter, you put dirt here.

36:41.283 --> 36:44.752
In spring, we just take off.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.003
Done.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.475
Perfect.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.532
This is...

37:06.850 --> 37:08.192
Got it.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.199
Bene. Perfect.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.034
You take out this...

37:18.987 --> 37:20.955
- All of them?
- Si.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.238
What's that, kitty?

37:54.356 --> 37:57.199
What's that? What's that?

39:14.102 --> 39:16.153
This...

39:19.107 --> 39:22.326
Fuck, this town is small, huh?

39:24.237 --> 39:25.287
Hi.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.872
Hey.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.666
You, uh... snuck out last night.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.670
- I did?
- Yeah.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.093
Mm. And who are you?

39:40.628 --> 39:43.097
Uh, Evan, the guy you
slept with last night.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.351
Sorry, I don't recall.

39:56.997 --> 40:00.197
- Evan.
- Oh, that's fucked up.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.699
- Don't be so emotional.
- That's messed up.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.360
This is the best place,
you should try it.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.297
Man, you eat a lot.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.050
I don't care if you call me fat.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.302
I was starting to think you were
cooler than pulling this one.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.138
I'm just saying I don't care.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.724
If this was the 1700s,
you would think I'm too skinny.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.601
You may not believe this,
but most men are not attracted

40:29.719 --> 40:31.353
to women who look like preteen boys.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.896
Mm, some are.

40:33.014 --> 40:36.191
That's true, but most men
just want a girl who's healthy.

40:36.309 --> 40:39.153
Obesity and anorexia,
they're equally unattractive.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.488
I think your opinion of men is too high.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.949
No, I know dudes.
All we ever think about is sex,

40:44.067 --> 40:45.492
sometimes food, sad truth.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.162
You shouldn't say that out loud.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.205
Hey, do you mind if we go in here?

40:51.123 --> 40:52.166
Sure.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.210
- Do you smoke?
- Sometimes.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.588
I smoke more than sometimes.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.548
Then don't.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.258
I don't want to live forever.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.801
How about this, you go out
with me tomorrow night,

41:02.919 --> 41:04.803
I won't buy any cigarettes.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.054
What?

41:06.172 --> 41:08.724
Will you go out with me
if I quit smoking?

41:08.842 --> 41:10.934
Don't quit for me.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.938
You don't want to go out with me again?

41:15.056 --> 41:16.732
I don't know.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.820
One, uh... una?

41:21.938 --> 41:25.282
Si. Uh, those.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.875
Who are these guys?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.335
That's Bob and Sally.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.630
I rescued them from a lab
that was done with them.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.506
Would you like to adopt them?

41:41.624 --> 41:43.383
- No, I'm good.
- Mm.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.469
Are you sure they should be
in the same cage?

41:45.587 --> 41:48.388
It's only until I find them a home.

41:48.506 --> 41:52.809
Yeah, but they're gonna fuck like...
you're gonna have a billion rabbits.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.688
Do you mind if I put on some music?

41:56.806 --> 41:59.066
Sure, but don't judge me.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.817
Are you allergic to anything?

42:00.935 --> 42:04.905
Uh, no. These are in
a lot of different languages.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.615
You said you wouldn't judge.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.451
- I'm not, I'm just impressed.
- Good.

42:09.569 --> 42:10.994
Do you speak any of these languages?

42:11.112 --> 42:14.081
Mm-hmm. Do you like leeks?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.416
Sure. How many do you speak?

42:16.534 --> 42:19.086
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't know?

42:19.204 --> 42:23.465
Um... French, German, Italian,

42:23.583 --> 42:27.135
Spanish, a few forms of Arabic,

42:27.253 --> 42:30.889
Japanese, Latin, Greek...

42:31.007 --> 42:33.767
I think that's it.

42:33.885 --> 42:38.272
- You don't speak Sumerian?
- No, do you?

42:38.389 --> 42:41.692
I don't speak dead languages.

42:42.616 --> 42:44.361
Do you mind?

42:44.479 --> 42:46.321
The ashtray isn't decoration.

42:47.857 --> 42:49.908
That's true.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.209
You should quit smoking.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.420
You are a hypocrite.

43:03.248 --> 43:06.049
No, I'm not.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.596
Uh, would you mind watching the soup

43:11.714 --> 43:14.474
while I use the restroom?

43:14.592 --> 43:16.810
Yeah, sure.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.779
- Soup's ready.
- Just a second.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.742
Do you ever feel like
you have to shower immediately?

44:13.860 --> 44:16.453
Uh, I think that's a girl thing.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.330
Showering is a girl thing?

44:18.448 --> 44:20.791
I'm going to the beach on Sunday.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.752
You are waiting to bathe in the sea?

44:23.870 --> 44:26.296
Uh, yup. You want to come?

44:26.414 --> 44:28.173
That's gross.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.966
Seriously, do you want to go with me?

44:30.084 --> 44:33.553
I can't. I'm taking medication
that makes my skin sun-sensitive.

44:35.214 --> 44:38.475
So, I only get to see you at night?

44:38.593 --> 44:41.561
You can meet my husband
and kids, if you want,

44:41.679 --> 44:44.898
but our nights together
must remain a secret.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.901
Mm. Yeah, we'd probably get
bored with each other anyway.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.824
Not bad. What's in it?

44:53.941 --> 44:56.326
Leeks, saffron, and rabbit.

44:58.738 --> 45:00.497
It's just a broth

45:00.615 --> 45:03.875
with a bunch of spices and vegetables.

45:03.993 --> 45:06.211
Oh, Jesus, you're a vegetarian?

45:06.329 --> 45:10.298
I try to be, but sometimes I crave meat.

45:25.473 --> 45:26.606
I've got to go to work.

45:26.724 --> 45:30.360
Thank you, be safe. Blanket.

45:48.830 --> 45:52.382
- Is this bad?
- It's a tree.

45:52.500 --> 45:55.260
- Here.
- Why don't you just kill 'em?

45:55.378 --> 45:58.847
They help to make fruit.

45:58.965 --> 46:02.476
They kill the tree
so they can pollinate it?

46:02.593 --> 46:04.686
Mother Nature is crazy, Angelo.

46:06.848 --> 46:08.899
What the hell is that?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.943
Tumore della radice.

46:12.061 --> 46:13.820
No capisco.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.822
Rotten roots.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.908
Root rot, huh?

46:21.529 --> 46:23.747
I've been seeing this Italian girl.

46:23.865 --> 46:26.041
She's really pretty.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.084
But she acts kind of weird sometimes

46:28.202 --> 46:31.729
and I found something
that gives me some doubts.

46:32.547 --> 46:34.461
I appreciate the Italian lessons,
really, I do,

46:34.561 --> 46:36.326
but, Angelo, I have no idea
what the hell you're saying.

46:36.444 --> 46:38.803
Choose your poison.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.972
That's your advice?

46:41.090 --> 46:45.060
Italian women, the best.

46:45.178 --> 46:48.688
That's wonderful advice, Angelo,
but have you been anywhere else?

46:48.806 --> 46:49.981
In France.

46:50.099 --> 46:53.026
So Italian women, you think they're
better than French women?

46:53.144 --> 46:55.362
I get that.

46:55.480 --> 46:58.490
Your wife was a goddess,
Angelo, but I got to tell you

46:58.608 --> 47:01.576
there's a lot of really
beautiful women in the USA.

47:01.694 --> 47:04.412
Italian women.

47:04.530 --> 47:07.791
You realize in America there are
a lot of Italian immigrants, right?

47:10.203 --> 47:14.339
Okay, what now? Is it... do we, like,
bury a virgin lamb skull

47:14.457 --> 47:16.424
full of herbs to ward off the infection?

47:16.542 --> 47:17.884
Che cosa?

47:18.002 --> 47:20.220
You know, the whole voodoo
biodynamic farming thing?

47:20.338 --> 47:23.014
I worked at a restaurant in college.
They told me that Italian farmers...

47:23.132 --> 47:25.183
that's how they do it.
You don't do that?

47:25.301 --> 47:28.937
Fungus killer spray in shed.

47:29.055 --> 47:30.814
Spray? Got it.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.149
- Did you farm again today?
- Yes, I did.

48:14.267 --> 48:17.611
It's amazing,
you're picking it up so quickly.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.237
I don't make bad jokes
about what you do.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.406
I can imagine it being this really
intense apprenticeship

48:21.524 --> 48:24.909
where he shares all of his worldly
knowledge as you tend to the land.

48:25.027 --> 48:27.746
No, it's nothing like that.

48:30.449 --> 48:32.959
- Hey.
- What?

48:33.077 --> 48:36.421
Can I ask you something? Don't get mad.

48:36.539 --> 48:38.798
Depends what it is.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.134
This morning I found a used syringe
on your bathroom floor.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.762
I know it's none of my business
and we just met, but...

48:43.879 --> 48:46.598
Uh, okay, it's not drugs.
I have a medical condition

48:46.716 --> 48:50.310
that comes and goes
and it's a very long story.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.647
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
even bothered to...

48:53.764 --> 48:57.525
I'm... I didn't think you were a junkie,
I just needed to know what it was.

48:57.643 --> 49:00.320
Do you think I gave you AIDS?

49:00.438 --> 49:03.448
- No.
- Oh, you did. You thought it!

49:03.566 --> 49:04.908
- No, I didn't.
- Hep C?

49:05.026 --> 49:08.286
- That would've been worth it.
- Oh, come on, I don't believe you.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.914
Can I do something
really corny right now?

49:11.032 --> 49:12.123
Again?

49:12.241 --> 49:13.750
I've been carrying this thing
around for a week

49:13.868 --> 49:16.753
and I haven't used it once,
but I'd really like a picture with you.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.088
You haven't called anyone?

49:18.205 --> 49:22.050
Uh, calling card's cheaper
and the only person I call is Tommy

49:22.168 --> 49:24.469
and he's always drunk, so...

49:24.587 --> 49:27.472
What about your family?

49:29.592 --> 49:31.726
Well, tell me about your family.

49:31.844 --> 49:34.813
Well, they're great.

49:34.930 --> 49:37.107
Scusa. Scusa!

49:40.811 --> 49:43.822
- Sure.
- Grazie.

49:43.939 --> 49:46.282
- Just one photo, please.
- All right.

49:48.752 --> 49:51.346
- Okay.
- Grazie.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.707
- You moved.
- Un altro?

49:53.824 --> 49:56.334
- No, no. Grazie, no.
- Okay.

50:00.956 --> 50:04.676
Tell... tell me about your family.

50:04.794 --> 50:08.680
I really don't want to
do that right now.

50:10.591 --> 50:12.016
Come on.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.896
You're seriously mad because
I don't want to talk about something?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.732
You just want to come here,
fuck a foreign girl,

50:18.849 --> 50:20.608
and show your stupid friend the picture.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.736
That doesn't make any sense.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.863
And when I ask you
something important about you

50:24.980 --> 50:27.991
and you don't tell me,
that means you can't be intimate.

50:28.109 --> 50:29.325
I'm so confused right now.

50:29.443 --> 50:33.163
Look, I went to
the fucking beach with you.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.682
I'm sorry.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.976
I think you're overreacting,
but I'm sorry.

50:55.094 --> 50:59.564
And I think you're being annoying,
but maybe I was just being crazy.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.484
Do you want to hear about my family?

51:02.601 --> 51:05.111
Yes, I do. Yes.

51:05.229 --> 51:06.571
It's a fucked-up story.

51:06.689 --> 51:09.240
So we're sleeping together
and I'm, like, making you meals,

51:09.358 --> 51:10.617
but you can't tell me anything?

51:10.735 --> 51:12.410
The only family I had
was my mom and dad.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.788
My dad died suddenly of a heart attack.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.749
My mom was diagnosed with
cancer a few months after that.

51:17.867 --> 51:19.876
I came home from college
a couple years ago

51:19.994 --> 51:22.587
to take care of her
and she died last week.

51:25.458 --> 51:28.218
Wow, I mean, that's horrible.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.386
No shit.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.265
Not exactly great dinner conversation.

51:34.383 --> 51:36.893
Are you okay?

51:39.138 --> 51:42.690
Do I seem all right?

51:44.226 --> 51:46.694
I like you.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.238
Were you better before?

51:48.355 --> 51:50.698
I think I'm all right.

51:50.816 --> 51:55.328
You've got the same backstory as Batman.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.760
This is so cool.

52:00.159 --> 52:02.377
Are you mad?

52:02.495 --> 52:05.380
I mean, I've got nothing to avenge
if I become a masked vigilante...

52:05.498 --> 52:07.841
Oh, shut up. I mean how sometimes

52:07.958 --> 52:11.094
even if you don't believe in a higher
power, you get mad at one.

52:13.047 --> 52:17.517
Yeah, I'm mad at something
for doing that to them,

52:17.635 --> 52:20.228
making me put my life on hold

52:20.346 --> 52:22.647
while I worked at the same shitty bar

52:22.765 --> 52:25.900
I grew up thinking
I never want to end up at.

52:31.065 --> 52:33.658
How do girls know to do that?

52:33.776 --> 52:36.452
What is it you would've done instead?

52:38.155 --> 52:40.790
I don't know.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.333
And I feel...

52:42.451 --> 52:47.255
I feel guilty and selfish for...

52:47.373 --> 52:52.010
like a sociopath for worrying
about what I'm doing for work

52:52.127 --> 52:54.178
when my whole family just died.

52:54.296 --> 52:58.850
Your professional life is fine.

52:58.968 --> 53:01.019
Do you feel like an orphaned farmer?

53:02.304 --> 53:05.565
No, but I feel like a grown-ass man
who misses his parents.

53:14.125 --> 53:15.699
So...

53:17.444 --> 53:19.787
you gonna tell me something now?

53:21.240 --> 53:23.204
Like what?

53:24.451 --> 53:26.544
I don't know. But I just bared
my soul to you.

53:26.662 --> 53:29.672
- That was baring your soul?
- Fuck off.

53:29.790 --> 53:32.967
Okay, let's see, mm.

53:33.085 --> 53:34.886
Not this one, no.

53:35.004 --> 53:40.725
Um, did you know I have
two different color eyes?

53:40.843 --> 53:42.727
What do you mean?

53:47.641 --> 53:49.400
Holy shit.

53:49.518 --> 53:51.069
Why do you wear the contact?

53:52.521 --> 53:55.907
My ex-boyfriend always made fun of it.

53:56.025 --> 53:58.826
- What an asshole.
- I'm joking. I'm lying.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.745
No one ever did that.

54:02.448 --> 54:04.123
You probably lie a lot.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.834
I've actually never lied to you.

54:06.952 --> 54:10.254
Not once.

54:10.372 --> 54:13.424
Your eyes are beautiful.

54:13.542 --> 54:16.177
And you're not very creative.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.273
Hey, Angelo?

54:31.226 --> 54:33.111
Si?

54:36.273 --> 54:39.534
Never seen a tree that has
two different fruits on it.

54:39.652 --> 54:41.577
Lorange tree.

54:41.695 --> 54:45.081
Got lemons and oranges,
so I call it a lorange tree.

54:45.199 --> 54:47.583
Or are those limes?

54:50.204 --> 54:53.340
You get it, loranges?

54:53.440 --> 54:54.492
That's it?

54:56.794 --> 55:00.638
Old tree uses new tree.

55:00.756 --> 55:02.265
The fruit looks good.

55:02.383 --> 55:03.933
Oh, yes.

55:06.804 --> 55:09.313
- Vulcano.
- Volcano?

55:09.431 --> 55:12.859
Yes, volcano make good soil.

55:12.977 --> 55:15.528
- Is it active?
- Ha!

55:40.947 --> 55:42.972
Shit.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.431
Good job, Bob.

56:30.012 --> 56:31.729
Sorry, Sally.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.973
Come in.

58:31.091 --> 58:32.391
Hey.

58:32.509 --> 58:34.602
Long, bad day.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.020
Let's stay in.

58:36.138 --> 58:37.521
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:37.639 --> 58:40.650
Sorry I'm being really boring.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.486
- You feel all right?
- I think so.

58:43.604 --> 58:45.029
Do I look all right?

58:45.147 --> 58:46.530
You look beautiful.

58:46.648 --> 58:50.409
I might be sick. You may not
want to get too close.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.207
What are you doing?

58:56.325 --> 58:59.293
Lift up your head.

58:59.411 --> 59:03.881
I read that this is what you do
when a girl gets sick.

59:03.999 --> 59:05.883
You don't have to.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.761
Anything to eat?

59:08.879 --> 59:12.431
There are some oranges
and yogurt in the fridge.

59:12.549 --> 59:15.476
Here, find something for us to watch.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.230
What happened to Bob and Sally?

59:19.348 --> 59:21.440
I don't want to talk about it.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.241
You want some?

59:30.359 --> 59:32.910
Thanks.

59:33.028 --> 59:35.204
My friend Tommy
said he was born with a tail.

59:35.322 --> 59:38.749
I doubt your friend Tommy
is one of the 23 cases ever.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.293
- No, he totally is.
- Mm, yeah.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.753
We have lots of things
we don't use anymore.

59:42.871 --> 59:45.506
I'm pretty sure they sell this
at Urban Ourfitters.

59:45.624 --> 59:48.843
It's oversimplified and misleading,
but I like the pictures.

59:48.961 --> 59:50.803
Want some water?

59:50.921 --> 59:52.888
Vino.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.890
- Vino?
- Wine.

59:55.008 --> 59:56.475
I know.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.440
Thank you.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.117
Di piu? How much more?

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:15.286
Basta finito.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:18.456
- For the day?
- Si.

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.166
Well, let's go fishing or something.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.501
No. Sono stanco.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.961
Come on, man.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.213
My girlfriend's at work,
I got nothing to do.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.468
Look, if you're stanco,
let me drive these down.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.806
Have fun.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.687
Whoo! Touchdown, Epsilon,

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:27.191
Lamda, Omega! Run! Run, run, Pledge!

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.944
Run faster, faggot!

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.030
Oh, oh, fuck you!

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.533
Oh, oh, oh!

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:42.748
Oh, say, can you see

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.835
My gigantic cock?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.761
- Oh. Hi.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:39.763
- What are you doing here?
- Walking home from work.

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.432
What are you doing here?

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.476
Um, here.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.936
We're buying gifts now?

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:49.607
It has Roman porn in it. Remember?

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.108
You didn't sign it, though.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.589
There are so many more
tourists here than usual.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:15.549
This is the beginning.

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:18.969
Late spring is a madhouse.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.431
- You want to go somewhere?
- Let's go.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:26.560
Okay, but you can't tell anyone.
It's a secret.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.605
Not Tommy, no girls.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.233
- Anywhere away from tourists.
- You're a tourist.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.485
We have to get my boat. Come on.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:36.654
You have a boat?

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.660
- Come on, faster, Evan! Faster!
- Can you swim if we sink?

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.703
The lady gorilla won't sink.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.539
Seriously, can you swim?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.332
Okay, so we're very close.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.168
So paddle us as fast as you can,
then get down.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.848
All right, have you done this before?

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.722
This looks like magic.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.851
Looks like stuff from nature
we haven't figured out yet.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:09.812
Well, what makes this?

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.981
The glow? It's from refracted sunlight

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:15.150
coming through a big hole underwater.

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:16.694
How did you find it?

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.654
My friend showed it to me.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:23.492
There are some others the tours
go to, but this one is a secret.

01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:29.707
Some of the Roman statues from
the exhibit were found over there.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:40.050
Hormones and biochemistry.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:43.887
Moment ruined and I think
we're taking on water.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:46.223
Stop talking shit about my boat, Evan.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.078
Can I ask you something awkward now?

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:09.913
No.

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:14.126
Do you ever change your clothes?

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.587
- Yes!
- Really?

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.964
All I brought is my backpack
and the only things they sell here

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.633
are, like, "I heart Bologna" shirts.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.344
Octopussy!

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:26.347
- We are not all like that.
- Octopussy.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:28.057
You girls old enough to drink?

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.143
You know where we can get some beer?

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:32.936
Uh, Evan, are you still hungry?

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.229
No, I'm good.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.440
'Cause you know, the clinic
opens really early tomorrow.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.734
- Yeah, I have work tomorrow, too.
- I've got to go to bed.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.903
- Don't pay for me.
- No, you did all the rowing.

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:44.198
But thanks for a wonderful time.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.024
What up?

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:22.778
Hey, I have weed in my hotel room.

01:06:27.769 --> 01:06:29.660
I don't speak French.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:35.124
How much to suck my dick?

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.845
What the...?

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:33.432
Football bad?

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.058
Si.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.643
Where are you off to all dapper?

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.270
Chiesa. Come.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.455
Grazie.

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:07.508
Your Italian is going better.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.662
Yeah, I'm trying.

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:14.139
Are there any single donne at church?

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.475
Si.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.602
You should ask one out.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:24.524
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

01:08:24.642 --> 01:08:26.484
My wife.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:33.033
Oh, well...

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.786
if you ever feel ready, then you should.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.335
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.962
Something wrong?

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.673
No, it's...

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.466
- Can I come in?
- No, it's not a good time right now.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.973
Um, well, I mean if you really have to.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:53.572
Um, I didn't sleep at all last night,

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:57.200
so forgive me if I stumble through this.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.828
I don't even know how much
you need me to tell you this,

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:02.247
because it's been barely a week,

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.043
but things got intense so fast and...

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:10.088
Tell me what?

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.216
We can't see each other anymore.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:18.305
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:21.058
I don't think you're ready
for where this is going

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:22.935
and I have some things
I need to work through

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.895
without being in a relationship.

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.855
And, Evan, I'm...

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:30.525
I'm really, really sorry
for leading you on like this.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:34.321
I can see how
you could feel like this has...

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.032
this has all been going so fast.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:40.160
Like, if you're freaked out and you
need some space, that's fine.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:42.245
Evan, you've been through a lot recently

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:45.749
and maybe you're not
thinking clearly, but...

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.712
I'm fine.

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:53.757
- What's your problem?
- No, I...

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:58.261
I'd really rather not explain
what's the problem.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:02.307
Um, again, I can't tell you
how sorry I am

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.727
and that you're a wonderful guy, but...

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:09.815
What happened to intimacy
being talking about stuff?

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:15.195
That's it? So I leave here

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:18.740
and it's like you and I never happened?

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.618
We never see each other again?

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:29.084
Okay.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:39.052
I want you to know something...

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:42.431
take it or leave it...

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.516
I think you could be
the love of my life,

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.894
and I know that sounds stupid,
it's only been five days.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.147
But it's true.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.150
If you don't feel anything for me
and that's what this is really about,

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.110
then I wish you the best
with everything in your life

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:58.321
'cause I think you're an amazing person.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:01.074
But if you do feel something,

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:04.286
I think you should think
about this a little bit longer.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.004
All right.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.950
I'm taking off, Angelo.

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.499
Uh, donne problema.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.335
Oh, I didn't hit her.

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:57.214
I hit a wall 'cause she
broke up with me.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:12:59.216
Stupido.

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.011
"Donna Italiana," right?

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.138
Ciao.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:10.435
Hey, Angelo?

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.065
I wanted to say thank you.

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:17.067
Uh, even with all this,
I'm living the fantasy

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:19.402
of some rich American housewife.

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.407
I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna stay here,

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:27.202
but I want you to know
that I appreciate all this.

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:33.875
Policia?

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:36.211
Immigrazione.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:38.588
Immigration? Do I need to worry?

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.966
- Si.
- Should I run?

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.759
Si.

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:18.295
So back in the US,
the cops are after me.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.089
Before that, I lost my job

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.593
and lost my... my parents.

01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:29.764
Here, I lost my job,

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:34.352
lost my girlfriend,
and the cops are after me.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.829
Can you start...

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:18.456
can you start the shower, please?

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:43.898
Are you a vampire, werewolf,

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:47.444
zombie, witch, or alien?

01:16:48.361 --> 01:16:50.113
Human.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.784
Are you scared of me?

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:58.163
Yeah,

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:01.916
but explain it to me.

01:17:05.413 --> 01:17:07.434
Sorry, I...

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.469
Evan.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.471
Calm...

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.765
Fuck.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:25.273
Evan, that is me.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.735
No, it's not.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.195
It is.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:33.490
I posed for that painting
almost 2,000 years ago.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.826
Ha! This is the crazy I can't handle.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:40.663
My eyes are like this because
of hereditary heterochromia.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.040
Do you know what that means?

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.501
I don't know. You, like, give it
to your kids or something?

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:47.629
Correct, but I've been
giving it to myself.

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:49.714
There are things I have found out
in the last two decades

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:52.759
that I don't understand entirely
and you may find them upsetting.

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.344
You're trying not to upset me?

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:57.013
You dumped me and became a monster.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:59.057
Okay, you win one argument.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:03.144
Um, do you know
what embryonic stem cells are?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.438
Cure stuff. You abort babies to get 'em.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.982
Not necessarily, but you
kind of get the idea.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.443
They replicate for a long time
and can be used to heal

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:12.195
- or maintain your whole body.
- So that's what you are?

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:14.072
You're like "Newsweek" fountain
of youth cells or something?

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.990
Sure, so my body uses the cells

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:19.661
so I stay the same age
and heal very fast.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:22.539
But... embryonic cells?

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.999
Are you fucking pregnant?

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.961
Fuck!

01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:30.046
I conceive and about a week later

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:33.049
I'm a healthy 20-year-old
with 50% new DNA.

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:37.720
I stay the same age for about 20 years
and then I need new cells.

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:41.433
- And you dumped me once you got 'em.
- You wouldn't have recognized me anyway.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.645
I'll have to start a new life.
I always do, every 20 years.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:48.481
Why tonight? Why even get to know me?

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.024
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.902
- Ha!
- God damn it, I mean physically.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.530
Before my body uses the cells,
it goes crazy.

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:58.408
I rot, I turn into creatures
from our evolutionary past,

01:18:58.526 --> 01:19:01.494
- I fucking kill stuff!
- Fuck!

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.082
- Hey, we both have tempers, huh?
- Yeah, but mine's worse.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.210
And something is off.
And I thought I could control it, but...

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.088
fuck, I got...

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:15.091
I got desperate
and I tried occult books and...

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:17.385
- Occult books?
- I ate my rabbit.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:20.096
- What?
- Okay, it's not magic, okay?

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:24.434
There's adult stem cells in cat brains
and rabbit intestines, testicles.

01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:25.935
Well, use those!

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:29.314
I do, but they aren't as effective.

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:33.193
Okay, well, whatever I saw
on your living room floor,

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.737
that was not the physical laws
of the universe.

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:37.363
- Okay, just...
- I need a second.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.449
Look, just because you haven't
seen something before, Evan,

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:41.784
doesn't mean it's supernatural.

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:45.163
Evan. Can you please stop walking away?

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.582
- Please?
- Give me a minute.

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:34.003
- Hello?
- Hello? Tommy!

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:35.463
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's Evan!

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.131
- Ev!
- What's up, man?

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:41.135
- How you doin', brother?
- I'm good, I'm good.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:44.264
- Yeah, I met a girl.
- What? Is she fucking hot?

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.684
Yeah, she's... she's really hot, yeah.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:51.854
- Um, do you have a sec?
- Uh, sure, man.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:53.356
What's up?

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:57.235
I got this girl or, uh...
maybe monster pregnant

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.028
and I don't know if she's gonna, like,

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:01.030
- give birth to herself or...
- What?

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:04.242
- Hello? Tommy? Tommy?
- Hello? Ev?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.703
Ev, dude, I just smoked
a huge fucking bowl...

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.746
- Smoked a huge bowl?
- Yeah, man.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.874
- Like, right before you called.
- Gotcha.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:13.626
Yeah, right before I got
on the phone? Okay.

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:15.378
Yeah.

01:21:15.496 --> 01:21:19.382
Um, no, no. No problem, man,
no problem at all.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.176
Just, uh... I'll call you back
another time.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:23.761
Call me back, man.
Have a good time out there.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.556
Yeah. Yup, enjoy.

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:37.752
I know it's complicated, obviously,

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.464
but let's talk about this.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:48.388
That's me.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.807
It's something chemical.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:53.476
Pheromones.

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:55.520
If I do this to a plant,
you have to wonder what it is

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:57.438
you're actually feeling.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.485
I've seen what happens to you.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:06.656
I mean, I've seen this
at its worst, right?

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:08.491
And I can deal with that part.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:12.495
No. You want to be with someone
that is basically going to be related

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:15.790
to you and when you're 85
you'll look like an inbred pedophile?

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.793
- Yes, probably.
- No.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.503
In a day I'll be someone else and, Evan,

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:23.339
you should get far
to keep all your stuff attached.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:26.676
Let's use the time we have.

01:23:26.794 --> 01:23:29.387
Why? Why?

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.013
For just a little while longer,

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:34.183
I'm a normal guy, you're a normal girl.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.893
We're here.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:39.355
I'd regret it if we didn't
take this to its end.

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:43.484
Evan, you know that I'm not
in love with you, right?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.701
You like being with me.

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:53.911
You like the sex and all that?

01:23:56.824 --> 01:23:59.083
You smell good.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:01.586
And you're funny,

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:04.714
and I like the closeness.

01:24:04.832 --> 01:24:07.633
Great.

01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:10.052
So...

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:14.640
how different is your personality
gonna be when you use my cells?

01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:17.643
Well, with your impulsiveness
and some other personality stuff,

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.270
about half of you.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.731
Keep my memories, that's nice.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:25.485
When you realize that you're
madly in love with me.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:27.236
That's the only way this goes down?

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.655
To live forever, yes.

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:32.158
What about not forever?

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:36.078
Evan, I really think you're great,
but I'm not giving up eternity

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:37.663
- for a guy I just met a week ago.
- I know.

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:42.001
I don't mean to sound like a selfish
dick, but is there a way?

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:45.338
My adult stem cells, but they're weak
and they would give me one life.

01:24:46.874 --> 01:24:48.925
So you'd be choosing death?

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:51.677
I don't choose.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:54.680
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:58.476
Seven days from getting pregnant,
my body metabolizes the cells

01:24:58.594 --> 01:25:00.937
and that's in about a day.

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:08.152
So spend it with me on a road trip.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.612
No.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:13.574
The transformations are getting
way worse and I can't control them.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:17.620
Come on, 24-hour road trip,
or until you love me.

01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:19.872
Evan, maybe we should just
rip the Band-Aid off

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:24.460
before a fucking scaly appendage
rips off your... head.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.546
You know, you get until Earth dies,

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.048
I get one more day with you.

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.259
- Shit.
- What?

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:33.010
Immigration.
They came to the farm today.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.471
- Fuck, we should get out of here.
- Why?

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:38.015
- Um, Italian jail.
- What?

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.142
Yes, they throw in illegal
immigrants all the time.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.019
Dude, they're gonna rape you.

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:49.277
Anybody ever driven off the cliff?

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.445
Uh, I did once.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:53.823
Years ago.

01:25:55.374 --> 01:25:56.959
You're not driving.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:06.377
All right, where's our first hideout?

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.962
Naples!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.006
What's in Naples?

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:14.385
Good restaurants and stores
for you to buy some clothes.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.263
You never told me you had a car.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:20.057
It never came up.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.893
Pull over.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.436
What else do you have?

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.897
You've seen my boat.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:30.484
Come on, in 2,000 years
you must've invested in something.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:33.863
Okay, I have an apartment in Rome.

01:26:33.981 --> 01:26:36.240
In Paris.

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.326
In Bali.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.703
So you're slummin' it with me right now?

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.039
It actually is a fucking nightmare.

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.250
I have to constantly come up
with new federal ID numbers,

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:50.338
will stuff to myself...
it's a nightmare.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.924
- Right.
- Right.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.259
What's your original name?

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:59.180
Uh, uh... I don't remember.

01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:01.057
Really?

01:27:01.174 --> 01:27:03.976
Well, do you remember the address
of your childhood home?

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.395
Yes, I do.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.230
Fuck! Oh, fuck! Evan!

01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:09.774
The olive farmer police!

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:11.359
Just get down, they won't see you.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.860
- No!
- Just get down.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.820
Hold on. Hold on.

01:27:18.509 --> 01:27:22.870
- Are they gone?
- Yeah. That was very European.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.384
This is some hipster shit.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.514
We should get back on the road.

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:44.767
What do you like more,
pool or the ocean?

01:27:44.885 --> 01:27:47.603
Um, ocean.

01:27:47.721 --> 01:27:49.772
No sharks in pools, that's nice,

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:53.275
but the ocean goes on and on and on.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:54.902
It's mysterious.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.612
Put your feet in the ocean, then.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:59.615
No, no, this pool has enough mystery.

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:03.244
I mean, it doesn't make any sense,
but it's nice.

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:05.371
Like you.

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:08.290
- I don't make any sense?
- No, not really.

01:28:12.079 --> 01:28:15.256
Why go on the run with me, then?

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:19.760
First time we sat down
and talked, it was easy.

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.596
And then it stayed easy.

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:24.473
And that's it?

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:27.601
You had a profound moment I missed?

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:33.149
First time we had sex.

01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:34.650
Really?

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.903
Yeah.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:40.865
No, I mean, really, like, you knew then

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:43.993
you wanted graves next to each other?

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:47.997
No, I mean I... there wasn't
a moment when I knew.

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.375
But I do know.

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.506
I'm just saying if I felt we should
share all of our time together...

01:28:57.624 --> 01:29:00.134
and I'm not saying I do...

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:04.513
it's not because of something
that could be expressed.

01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:08.350
And also, like, you saw me
all fucked up and you're still here.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:12.563
Oh.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.274
I guess...

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:19.779
your place is clean. I like that.

01:29:19.896 --> 01:29:23.032
And your voice,
your voice keeps me around.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.293
What?

01:29:36.163 --> 01:29:38.589
Welcome to Naples!

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:42.009
- Benvenuto!
- Are we looking for crack?

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:45.304
We're on the run.
No police ever come here.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:47.389
You're trying to get me killed.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.225
- Hashish?
- How much?

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:51.185
- No, grazie, grazie. Grazie.
- 20?

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.562
- Can you change 50?
- Don't even make eye contact.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.398
Are you kidding me?

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:58.567
Do you have a lighter?

01:30:00.953 --> 01:30:02.738
That's terrible.

01:30:02.856 --> 01:30:05.241
We should buy you some clothes now.

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:08.244
- Why do you hate my shirt?
- You don't listen.

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.538
- Oh, I listen.
- No, you still don't.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:12.248
Oh, I listen.

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:13.833
Uh, let's see, I got you pregnant.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.460
You can use those embryo cells
to heal fast and live forever.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.839
When you do that, you physically become
half the man who got you pregnant.

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:22.591
Um, when you are pregnant, you turn
into a cross between creatures

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:24.343
from our evolutionary past and a corpse.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.262
You could choose
to use your adult cells,

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:27.888
but then you'd die someday, so...

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:29.765
You know, honey,

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:33.144
just because you listen to a few
things doesn't make you Oprah.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.062
- It does.
- No, it doesn't.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.816
I find it amazing that I even
understood half of what you said.

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:43.612
I've actually never been in a church.

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.948
Well, let's go in that one.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:47.825
- You wouldn't be bored?
- No, no.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:50.911
I haven't been to that one
since the grand opening.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:57.710
So do you know anything about all this?

01:30:57.828 --> 01:31:00.462
I've always been a student of science,

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.507
but it's pretty and I like the rituals.

01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:06.886
No, I mean do you know
anything about, like...?

01:31:07.003 --> 01:31:11.140
No. The gods change so much,
I can't keep up.

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:17.271
All this time and all the things
you haven't been able to explain.

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:20.941
Just seems like you'd know
more or something.

01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:24.445
Just because I can't explain
something about myself right now

01:31:24.563 --> 01:31:26.864
doesn't mean it's metaphysical.

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.824
It means science can't explain it yet.

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:33.787
You looked like a ghost
in that picture at the restaurant.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:35.539
You just saw me look like stuff

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:38.375
from stories you've read
or saw, that's it.

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:44.006
Guess giant squid were myths
until one washed up on a beach.

01:31:44.124 --> 01:31:46.467
People used to think people with rabies

01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:48.594
and porphyria were vampires,

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:51.138
but that doesn't mean vampires are real.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:54.016
It means science hadn't
caught up with the myth.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:57.686
And even if I knew I'm supernatural,
it doesn't prove anything about...

01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:04.485
Fear of the unknown makes a lot
of really pretty stuff, though.

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:12.660
Um, Louise, did you bring your shots?

01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:14.328
Yeah, there's one in my purse.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:17.498
- You should use it.
- Why, do you see something?

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:19.667
Yeah, a little something.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.168
Just do it here.

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:24.004
- Don't get up.
- Okay.

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:28.300
So, this time in Prussia,
1760-something,

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.135
so I'm walking through the cemetery

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:31.804
and they're digging up corpses,

01:32:31.922 --> 01:32:35.182
and the corpses would move
from escaping gases and whatnot.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.518
- And so they're, like, staking...
- Hey, hey, hey, shh.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:39.687
...dead people, calling them vampires.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:42.022
Nerve-wracking. So I left there.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.693
I'm in the New World and women
were hung for being witches

01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.861
for, like, a lot less than my quirks.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:50.489
One colonial guy said I was aging well.

01:32:50.607 --> 01:32:53.284
No joke, I was on the first ship
back to England.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:57.579
So, then I'm in France and they
were, like, burning women

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:59.248
at the stake for having a moody day.

01:32:59.366 --> 01:33:02.418
So I catch a train to Germany
in the 1930s, and, I mean, we all know

01:33:02.535 --> 01:33:04.670
- what happened there, right?
- Hey, Louise?

01:33:04.788 --> 01:33:07.715
Do you want to show me...
what's your favorite museum here?

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.050
- We should go check it out.
- Oh, okay.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:13.554
- Can we get some pizza first?
- Of course, yeah.

01:33:20.387 --> 01:33:23.689
Really pouring on
the melodrama in this one.

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:26.650
You look so different.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:31.905
Oh, yeah, my boyfriend before
was a very unattractive Ottoman.

01:33:32.023 --> 01:33:34.491
How many men are you a mix of?

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:35.909
You don't want to know.

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:38.370
I don't?

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:40.414
Are you jealous, Evan?

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:41.749
No, but if every...

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:43.417
you're 2,000 years old...
if every 20 years...

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:47.254
Do you have a problem with how
many men I slept with and my age?

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:51.091
Okay, just in the fresco
in the book I gave you.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:53.927
None. I'm actually 22 years old
in that painting.

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:55.929
You're a virgin in that painting?

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:59.266
Yes. Does that make you happy?

01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:07.066
So you really hated being martyred, huh?

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:09.902
I was just a peasant
posing for the scene.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.071
After the Black Plague,
I think I was just happy

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.781
I wasn't scrubbing bodily fluids.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.783
I have just one question.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.579
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.956
Where do you think I got
these fingers from?

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:26.043
You're still really pretty
as an Ottoman peasant.

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:29.003
Look at... look at this guy.
He's like...

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:32.800
"Stop! Stop hitting me!"

01:34:35.086 --> 01:34:38.347
I wanted to show you something
even older than me.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.100
I saw this on The Learning Channel.

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:45.396
It was a bomb shelter
during World War II.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:49.358
Yeah, mention World War II and every
American becomes a historian.

01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:52.736
Oh, do they? Well, we watch movies.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.072
Lots of them.

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:02.663
So, um, what happens when...
when this goes down?

01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:05.499
This body dies

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:07.668
and the cells recreate a new one.

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:11.380
And what if you use your adult cells?

01:35:11.498 --> 01:35:13.841
Then...

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:17.678
then I'd look exactly the same,
just pregnant,

01:35:17.796 --> 01:35:20.139
and that would be horrifying.

01:35:20.256 --> 01:35:22.015
How much time do you have left?

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:26.019
Until the equinox. Sunrise, probably.

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.397
Your body knows when winter ends?

01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:30.357
When I was little,
time was measured differently,

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:33.777
so all that bullshit with sun gods
and whatever, it never...

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:37.990
Cool, well, if you stay with me...

01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:42.536
I'll give something up, too.

01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:44.580
Smoking.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:49.460
We'll both end up like these guys.

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:53.338
Yeah, in, like, 50 years! Come on!

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:57.050
So you would be giving up life
to become a father?

01:35:57.168 --> 01:36:00.429
I'm an illegal immigrant olive farmer.
New frontiers.

01:36:00.547 --> 01:36:03.223
So you want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:07.019
Yeah.

01:36:07.137 --> 01:36:10.397
I think you're rushing dating

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:12.816
and death and fatherhood.

01:36:15.019 --> 01:36:17.404
Well, how do you choose
to use your adult cells?

01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:20.407
- Or your embryonic...
- Oh, wow, look at this guy!

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:22.993
Whoo!

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:25.162
How do you choose?

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:29.917
I don't.

01:36:30.034 --> 01:36:32.794
My... my body chooses.

01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:34.671
Well, how does your body choose?

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:39.468
Oxytocin.

01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:41.887
I'm totally lost again.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.685
It's the hormone that makes women
fall in love and get maternal.

01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:51.146
And if it were high enough,

01:36:51.264 --> 01:36:54.608
survival reaction blocks
the embryonic cells

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:57.110
and defaults into my adult stem cells.

01:36:58.605 --> 01:37:00.614
You know that?

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:03.283
I mean I don't, but I'm not sure.

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:06.787
But I can show you
the origin of the theory.

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:11.792
You're still not in love with me?

01:37:34.766 --> 01:37:37.317
Last syringe.

01:37:37.435 --> 01:37:39.152
You still want this?

01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:50.539
Okay.

01:37:50.657 --> 01:37:54.543
I... I want to show you where I grew up.

01:38:09.217 --> 01:38:11.560
So if you love me,

01:38:11.678 --> 01:38:15.355
then there's this hormone
and you'll stay the same?

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:17.524
In theory, yeah.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:21.737
But neither of us
has much control over it

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:25.490
and how would I even know?

01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:31.163
I know I'm in love with you.

01:38:31.281 --> 01:38:33.165
You know that?

01:38:33.283 --> 01:38:35.709
Yes.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:40.380
So it seems like you should
know if you love me or not.

01:38:40.498 --> 01:38:45.719
So you never lusted for someone
before and then it passed?

01:38:59.017 --> 01:39:02.069
So you've never been in love before?

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:05.030
I guess not.

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:07.741
- Not in thousands of years?
- I am not a sociopath, okay?

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:10.410
I just have really bad luck.

01:39:16.326 --> 01:39:17.751
- Bad luck.
- I got it.

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.836
Okay.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:26.426
You probably know the entire city

01:39:26.544 --> 01:39:29.262
was buried by the volcano
you see there in the distance.

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.057
Buried in ash and pumice
perfectly preserved

01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:34.851
and was rediscovered
and dug up centuries later.

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:36.895
And if you look to your left,
you'll see an example

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:38.772
of one of the earliest
"Beware of Dog" signs.

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.899
Are you sure there's no security here?

01:39:41.017 --> 01:39:43.860
No, but, Evan, I feel like you
don't want to see my home town.

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:47.823
- What the fuck?
- Yup.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.784
When excavators came across
chambers shaped like human...

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.869
Ev... Evan, no!

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:55.122
- No, come back.
- Was that a real dog?

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.124
What are you doing?

01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:00.919
They injected plaster into them
and that's what you get.

01:40:01.037 --> 01:40:04.589
And here we have the whorehouse.
I've never been there.

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:06.842
But I've been to the bakery
you see to your right

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:09.636
and to the bar here on the corner.

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:11.638
And...

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:13.390
What?

01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:18.311
I want to show you my family now.

01:40:20.098 --> 01:40:22.357
Okay, that's weird.

01:40:22.475 --> 01:40:25.610
I didn't know
their tombs were here, but...

01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:28.989
So this is my father,

01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:32.159
my mother, and my little brother.

01:40:34.404 --> 01:40:36.705
How did you get away in time?

01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:39.833
- I didn't.
- Then how did you get out?

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:43.003
You really want to know?

01:40:45.248 --> 01:40:48.425
It's 2,000 years ago, so I'm doing fine.

01:40:48.543 --> 01:40:51.553
My pain threshold is still
built for birthing,

01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:53.847
so lava is fine.

01:40:55.758 --> 01:40:58.393
My oxytocin case study?

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:00.771
I got it from her.

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:04.191
It's hereditary.

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:07.319
She gave it all up for me and my father.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:13.366
I don't want to die and I don't
want to watch anyone die.

01:41:17.155 --> 01:41:19.831
Well, at least you got the same
backstory as Harry Potter.

01:41:19.949 --> 01:41:22.209
That's pretty cool.

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:25.378
Can I say something
in absolute sincerity?

01:41:27.081 --> 01:41:29.800
I'm gonna miss the hell out of you.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.552
Like, it's gonna fucking hurt, bad.

01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:39.309
Your perfect male fantasy
just shattered.

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:41.728
A younger wife and a sugar mama.

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:48.902
Yeah, you forgot the incest part.
I mean, I'm an open-minded guy,

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.780
but I probably wouldn't want that.

01:41:51.898 --> 01:41:54.324
That's the Temple of Apollo sundial.

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:56.243
- This?
- No, no, no.

01:41:57.862 --> 01:41:59.955
After we borrowed him
from the ancient Greeks,

01:42:00.072 --> 01:42:01.873
he was replaced by Jesus,

01:42:01.991 --> 01:42:04.417
and now we don't know
who the old clock belongs to.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:09.965
Um, one last thing you should know.

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:17.389
Right before I transform,
if I transform...

01:42:17.507 --> 01:42:19.766
that monster

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:23.103
is gonna be the biggest and sharpest.

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:27.899
How big?

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:30.026
Just run.

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:32.112
Really fast.

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.118
We never got my clothes.

01:42:40.112 --> 01:42:44.624
No. One of us says something
about journey and destination.

01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:49.963
Destinations are underrated?

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:53.091
You ever wonder
what life is like in the finite?

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:56.052
Terrifying all the time, I'm sure.

01:42:57.063 --> 01:42:59.008
I don't think so.

01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:04.269
Even at my lowest, I'm still excited
to use the time the best I can.

01:43:04.387 --> 01:43:06.771
There's motivation to make
every second count.

01:43:10.643 --> 01:43:12.235
You never got lonely?

01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:17.073
Not since I met you.

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:19.868
Doesn't it scare you losing that?

01:43:32.999 --> 01:43:35.050
What are you doing?

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.802
Begging.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.263
Go on, it's time.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:52.692
Tell me more about the finite.

01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:03.119
let's see, uh...

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:07.624
when you're sick,
it makes you feel lucky

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:09.834
for all the times when you were healthy.

01:44:12.163 --> 01:44:15.256
Uh, sunrises and sunsets...

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:20.011
some things
are just beautiful no matter what

01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:22.681
and a constant reminder
that you only get so many.

01:44:24.342 --> 01:44:27.727
So you better fucking enjoy 'em.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:34.609
Some pizza and a bottle of wine
with the right person

01:44:34.727 --> 01:44:38.204
that can make the shittiest day better.

01:44:39.466 --> 01:44:42.862
Coffee dates take up a pretty
good chunk of your time, but...

01:44:42.962 --> 01:44:44.810
but they're worth it.

01:44:46.364 --> 01:44:50.250
I don't know, you can choose
to work yourself to death,

01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:54.546
but you could also
throw all that work away

01:44:54.664 --> 01:44:57.257
without regrets for the right person.

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:02.470
Maybe that's chemical,
but it's also magic.

01:45:05.216 --> 01:45:09.978
Uh, love comes around
a couple times, if you're lucky.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.525
Life probably seems short
no matter what, but...
