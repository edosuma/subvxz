* Love and marriage *

00:18.467 --> 00:20.934
* Love and marriage *

00:20.934 --> 00:22.734
* Go together like *

00:22.734 --> 00:25.200
* A horse and carriage *

00:25.200 --> 00:29.200
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.200 --> 00:31.133
* You can't have one *

00:31.133 --> 00:34.033
* Without the other *

00:34.033 --> 00:36.334
* Love and marriage *

00:36.334 --> 00:38.934
* Love and marriage *

00:38.934 --> 00:40.334
* It's an institute *

00:40.334 --> 00:42.734
* You can't disparage *

00:42.734 --> 00:46.501
* Ask the local gentry *

00:46.501 --> 00:51.067
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.067 --> 00:55.868
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:55.868 --> 00:59.567
* It's an illusion *

00:59.567 --> 01:04.700
* Try, try, try
And you will only come *

01:04.700 --> 01:08.133

01:15.701 --> 01:16.701
Hello, Carol?

01:16.701 --> 01:19.868
Bud Bundy here.

01:19.868 --> 01:22.367
Hello?

01:27.000 --> 01:31.501
Hello, Carol? Don't hang up.
I got tickets to the concert.

01:31.501 --> 01:33.667
Yes. It's Bud Bundy.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.000
Yep.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.167
What would you say
to a couple of primo seats

01:38.167 --> 01:40.434
to the Jimmy Dick and
the Nighsticks concert Saturday?

01:40.434 --> 01:44.601
Well, yeah,
you'd have to go with me.

01:44.601 --> 01:47.100
I think it's worth it too.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.133
Good. Good.

01:48.133 --> 01:51.133
What say I pick you up
at 8:00?

01:51.133 --> 01:53.300
 <i>Ciao,</i> baby.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.567
Ah...

01:54.567 --> 01:57.601
So many women,
so little time.

01:57.601 --> 01:58.601
Not me.

01:58.601 --> 02:01.601
I got one woman,
too much time.

02:01.601 --> 02:03.400
I'm not really
interested, Dad.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.400
Listen, I really want
to impress this girl,

02:06.400 --> 02:08.400
so could you
drive me?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.934
Oh, could you wear one of
those stupid chauffeur hats?

02:10.934 --> 02:13.434
And put something
under your arm

02:13.434 --> 02:15.267
so it looks like
you're packing a rod.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.267
Why, Bud?

02:17.267 --> 02:19.801
What your father's got
under there already

02:19.801 --> 02:23.100
is far more lethal.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.934
Al, the termite control man
would like to speak to you.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.067
Oh, why?

02:27.067 --> 02:30.868
I keep telling you,
we don't have termites.

02:35.133 --> 02:38.634
It's just
the house settling.

02:40.100 --> 02:43.033
Kel, did you get
the tickets for the concert?

02:43.033 --> 02:45.567
I sure did...
and backstage passes.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.067
All right, Kel.
You're a goddess.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.434
Give me my tickets.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.734
Oh, I decided
not to get you any.

02:50.734 --> 02:52.133
See, it was either
use your money

02:52.133 --> 02:54.434
to get four regular
concert tickets

02:54.434 --> 02:57.434
or to get two tickets
and two backstage passes for me,

02:57.434 --> 02:59.434
so I'm taking my ugly friend,
Mandy.

02:59.434 --> 03:01.200
That way, Jimmy will
only look at me.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.934
I'm so happy.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.601
Well, Kel...

03:05.601 --> 03:10.734
I'm happy for you, but...
what the hell about me?

03:10.734 --> 03:12.834
Oh, Bud...

03:12.834 --> 03:15.334
I'm going to meet
Jimmy Dick!

03:15.334 --> 03:17.834
He's got this house
in Jamaica.

03:17.834 --> 03:20.834
Do you know what I would
do for a house in Jamaica?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.167
Yeah, the same thing
you'd do

03:22.167 --> 03:24.200
for dinner and a movie.

03:28.501 --> 03:31.334
Getting back to my
petty problem, see,

03:31.334 --> 03:33.734
I finally got a date
with a girl who has a waist.

03:33.734 --> 03:36.234
I've never
had waist before.

03:36.234 --> 03:37.834
I've gotta have someplace
to take her.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.367
Come on, Bud.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.567
I'm sure there's
plenty of places

03:40.567 --> 03:42.300
you could take her instead.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.334
I know.

03:44.334 --> 03:47.968
The Peanuts Gang on Ice
is in town!

03:47.968 --> 03:50.200
You know I'll devote
the rest of my life

03:50.200 --> 03:51.367
to get revenge on you.

03:51.367 --> 03:53.167
Well, I'm not too worried.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.000
See, I'll always have
the smell of Clearasil

03:55.000 --> 03:56.100
to warn me that you're coming.

03:57.868 --> 04:00.467
How could we have termites?

04:00.467 --> 04:02.667
Kids, didn't I tell you
to wipe your feet

04:02.667 --> 04:04.868
before you come
into the house?

04:04.868 --> 04:08.334
Now look.
We have termites.

04:08.334 --> 04:10.501
Now, kids, don't be ashamed.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.200
Even the finest homes
have termites.

04:13.200 --> 04:18.367
Of course, they get them
from homes like ours.

04:18.367 --> 04:21.000
Hey, Kel, Dad's
in a real bad mood.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.267
Be on your
best behavior.

04:22.267 --> 04:24.000
The least little thing
could get you grounded.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.300
Don't worry.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.834
I cleaned up my room.
I did all my chores.

04:27.834 --> 04:31.267
I'm untouchable.

04:31.267 --> 04:36.601
Hey, Dad.
Report card day.

04:36.601 --> 04:40.901
I got four A's and a B,
but enough about me.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.901
Batter up.

04:45.634 --> 04:48.634
I, uh...I lost it.

04:48.634 --> 04:52.100
Well...this is
your lucky day...

04:56.634 --> 04:58.634
because I found it.

04:58.634 --> 05:01.634
It must have fallen out
of your purse

05:01.634 --> 05:05.567
and accidentally got
taped under your bed.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.067
How did she do?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.567
Ahem.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.634
F, F, F, D.

05:11.634 --> 05:14.501
What happened, Kel,
you attend one?

05:16.334 --> 05:18.868
Kelly, this is
the worst one yet.

05:18.868 --> 05:20.334
Now, we're going to have
to think

05:20.334 --> 05:21.868
of a punishment
for this.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.267
Hey, I'm sure
you'll think of something.

05:24.267 --> 05:27.000
Oh, by the way, have a good time
at that concert Saturday, Kel.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.868
Concert?

05:28.868 --> 05:31.267
You think that you're going
to a concert this weekend?

05:31.267 --> 05:33.000
No way.
You're grounded.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.234
Grounded?

05:34.234 --> 05:37.601
Kelly, you have got
to learn responsibility.

05:37.601 --> 05:39.000
Honey, would you like to see

05:39.000 --> 05:41.100
some of your father's
old report cards?

05:41.100 --> 05:44.100
He didn't think studying
was important either.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.701
Now look at him.

05:47.334 --> 05:49.601
Well, Mom, you're right,
of course,

05:49.601 --> 05:51.634
but won't you reconsider?

05:51.634 --> 05:53.033
I mean, I just know

05:53.033 --> 05:55.334
Kelly will study
for Monday's math test

05:55.334 --> 05:56.634
right after the concert.

05:56.634 --> 05:59.133
You have
a math test Monday?

05:59.133 --> 06:03.133
Damn my loose lips.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.167
Kelly?

06:04.167 --> 06:05.934
Oh, come on.

06:05.934 --> 06:08.701
I mean, when am I ever
going to need to know math?

06:08.701 --> 06:11.367
Well, you may need it for
your career, you know--

06:11.367 --> 06:17.467
three Whoppers,
large fries, and a Coke.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.067
EXTERMINATOR:
 <i>Yo, Mr. Bundy!</i>

06:19.067 --> 06:20.968
 <i>More news</i>
 <i>on the termite front.</i>

06:20.968 --> 06:22.267
Let me guess.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.100
A termite slipped
in the tub, broke his wing,

06:24.100 --> 06:26.100
and he's suing us.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.901
Well, on the good side,
he can't get much.

06:29.901 --> 06:31.901
Kel, I know what
you're thinking.

06:31.901 --> 06:34.934
"Now, what am I going to
do with those tickets?"

06:34.934 --> 06:36.300
Well, since I got you
grounded,

06:36.300 --> 06:37.501
I'll take them
off your hands.

06:37.501 --> 06:39.868
Do you think
that for one second

06:39.868 --> 06:41.367
I'm going to stay here
and study

06:41.367 --> 06:42.567
when I'm just
a paternity suit

06:42.567 --> 06:43.934
away from Jamaica?

06:46.767 --> 06:49.100
Oh, no, Budrick.
No.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.167
I'm sneaking out.
I do it all the time.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.834
No house
can hold me,

06:53.834 --> 06:55.634
and you are not going
to tell on me.

06:55.634 --> 06:57.734
You can count
on me, Kel.

06:57.734 --> 06:59.367
Oh, I know I can,
because, you see,

06:59.367 --> 07:01.234
I happen know the true identity

07:01.234 --> 07:03.000
of the masked
Lovers' Lane Peeper...

07:06.601 --> 07:09.567
You know, the one
the whole football team

07:09.567 --> 07:11.501
has a bounty on?

07:11.501 --> 07:14.868
You-- You have no proof.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.834
Oh?

07:19.234 --> 07:20.667
Then, uh...

07:20.667 --> 07:23.601
what would you call
this mask and flashlight?

07:25.567 --> 07:28.567
I just look.

07:28.567 --> 07:32.067
So, Mr. Bundy,
we tent this baby up,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.601
and in just a couple of days,
adios, termites.

07:34.601 --> 07:36.200
Oh yeah? Well, how
much will it cost

07:36.200 --> 07:37.200
to tent this baby up?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.767
Just a second.
Now, let's see.

07:39.767 --> 07:43.434
We're going to need
the special tent.

07:43.434 --> 07:45.100
Special tent?
For what?

07:45.100 --> 07:47.100
Well, you know, your
house is shaped oddly.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.901
You mean
like a house?

07:48.901 --> 07:50.601
Yeah. Too bad.

07:50.601 --> 07:55.400
Now, let's see.
You got floors. That's extra.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.400
You got rooms.
That's extra.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.667
And windows, too.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.300
Uh-oh.

08:01.300 --> 08:05.901
Now, you got an attached garage,
so I'll give you 10% off,

08:05.901 --> 08:09.901
but then it is another room,
so that's extra...

08:09.901 --> 08:12.067
plus gratuity....

08:12.067 --> 08:14.767
that comes to $1,750.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.567
Listen,
we'll think about it.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.100
We'll let you know.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.167
Okay, but be quick.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.567
Our price
goes up next week.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.868
I'm getting
my license.

08:23.868 --> 08:27.567
Kelly, you see what happens
when you study?

08:27.567 --> 08:31.067
$1,750 a job,
$1,750 a year.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.400
Yes, no.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.634
Winner, loser.

08:36.634 --> 08:39.601
Suicide, reason.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.467
Listen, I can squeeze you in
on Saturday.

08:45.467 --> 08:46.868
Saturday's fine.

08:46.868 --> 08:48.901
Saturday?

08:48.901 --> 08:50.033
Is a check okay?

08:52.267 --> 08:54.300
No.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.100
Ah, that's just great.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.601
$1,750 for a tent
to put over a house.

08:59.601 --> 09:05.100
Listen, why don't we just borrow
one of your mother's muumuus?

09:05.100 --> 09:07.100
Hell, if she doesn't wash it,

09:07.100 --> 09:12.067
we won't have to pay
for the poison, either.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.567
Well, since they're going
to be spraying the house

09:14.567 --> 09:15.634
with pesticides,

09:15.634 --> 09:16.834
the kids and I

09:16.834 --> 09:18.868
will have to find
someplace to stay.

09:18.868 --> 09:21.367
I can stay
at my friend Mandy's.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.400
Forget it, Kelly.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.734
You're grounded
this weekend.

09:23.734 --> 09:25.934
You're staying with the family
and studying.

09:25.934 --> 09:27.133
Now, let's see.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.667
We need a place to stay
that's cheap and comfortable

09:29.667 --> 09:31.067
and accepts pets.

09:31.067 --> 09:35.767
I got it. We'll sleep
in the shoe store.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.300
Oh, honey,
please reconsider.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.901
There's still time to get
four cardboard boxes

09:39.901 --> 09:42.334
and sleep
in the junkyard.

09:42.334 --> 09:45.968
Nah, it's too much
like staying at your mother's.

09:45.968 --> 09:48.601
Nah, the shoe store's
better and safer.

09:48.601 --> 09:51.868
Once I lock it up,
nobody can get in...

09:51.868 --> 09:53.834
Or out.

10:10.701 --> 10:15.000
Oh, sir...
it's been 10 minutes.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.634
Don't you think you
should get me a shoe?

10:18.634 --> 10:20.567
That's an all-too-common
mistake

10:20.567 --> 10:21.567
in the shoe biz, miss.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.834
You see, us real pros

10:23.834 --> 10:25.767
understand the need
of holding a foot

10:25.767 --> 10:27.367
and getting a good
look at the leg

10:27.367 --> 10:29.968
so we know what
we're dealing with.

10:29.968 --> 10:31.734
I hope you're not
too uncomfortable.

10:31.734 --> 10:36.467
Well, actually,
it turns me on.

10:36.467 --> 10:39.834
We're closed.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.734
Go home, Peg.

10:48.734 --> 10:50.834
I am home, Al.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.267
We're here, Dad.

10:54.267 --> 10:57.434
Oh, Dad!

10:57.434 --> 10:58.934
While you're here,

10:58.934 --> 11:02.601
can I show you
some of our bras?

11:02.601 --> 11:05.133
I think I better be going.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.834
Well, could you show me
some of yours?

11:22.133 --> 11:26.601
Uh, Al, are these some
of the fat women

11:26.601 --> 11:28.634
that you're always
complaining about?

11:28.634 --> 11:31.133
That was a once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Peg,

11:31.133 --> 11:33.734
and I'm so glad you guys
were here to scared it away.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.167
Oh, Peg, didn't you
bring him a bone or anything?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.767
Those are $100 pumps.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.267
Buck! Here, boy!

11:43.267 --> 11:46.667
Here, take this.
This one's on sale.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.167
Isn't that cute, Al?

11:48.167 --> 11:50.133
It's like he knows.

11:50.133 --> 11:51.334
Yeah, it's real cute,
Peg.

11:51.334 --> 11:53.534
When he's done with the shoe,
why don't you take him

11:53.534 --> 11:55.467
over to the cash register
for dessert?

11:55.467 --> 11:57.267
Kel, why don't you just
give me the tickets?

11:57.267 --> 11:59.501
You're not getting
out of here.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.501
That's what they said
about the 10th grade,

12:02.501 --> 12:05.234
but eventually,
I will.

12:05.234 --> 12:07.567
Well,
it's closing time.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.400
No, really?
Look at this.

12:13.968 --> 12:17.601
Go home, Peg.

12:17.601 --> 12:18.701
We're closed.

12:18.701 --> 12:20.501
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

12:20.501 --> 12:23.934
No! We've never
been more open.

12:23.934 --> 12:27.100
How can I disappoint
the poor ladies, Peg?

12:27.100 --> 12:30.801
Have sex with them.

12:34.567 --> 12:37.534
Ha! Ha! I intend to.

12:37.534 --> 12:41.701
Uh, ladies, sit down.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.467
Where are
you ladies from?

12:51.467 --> 12:53.968
We're from right next door--
The aerobics studio?

12:53.968 --> 12:55.968
So many times
we've passed by

12:55.968 --> 12:58.801
and seen your little face
pressed against the window.

12:58.801 --> 13:00.601
Oh, no.

13:00.601 --> 13:03.100
So we thought
we'd come in.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.667
Do you have time?

13:04.667 --> 13:06.467
For you?
Of course.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.968
Um, what can I
do for you?

13:08.968 --> 13:10.968
I was looking for
an evening shoe.

13:10.968 --> 13:13.968
Well, all right.
Let me measure your chest.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.067
I mean...ha, ha, ha!

13:17.267 --> 13:20.467
I mean your foot.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.968
Sometimes when
I'm at a party...

13:22.968 --> 13:25.968
I don't know,
I can't help myself.

13:25.968 --> 13:28.467
I think they call it
nymphomania.

13:28.467 --> 13:29.968
Every man I see,

13:29.968 --> 13:34.400
I just can't
keep my clothes on.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.601
Excuse me, sir.

13:38.601 --> 13:40.033
Since I'm the one
buying the shoes,

13:40.033 --> 13:42.000
don't you think you should
be measuring my foot?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.634
I'm sorry.
She's the nymphomaniac.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.133
Excuse me, sir,

13:47.133 --> 13:50.601
but I'm going to do what
all of your customers do--

13:50.601 --> 13:52.601
Go to Morty's for shoes,

13:52.601 --> 13:55.100
where they have
much cuter salesmen,

13:55.100 --> 13:56.601
and younger too.

13:56.601 --> 13:58.601
This guy
is pretty old.

13:58.601 --> 14:01.100
Maybe we should
go to Morty's.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.901
I hope there is
a really cute guy there.

14:02.901 --> 14:05.300
Old or not,
in another second,

14:05.300 --> 14:06.767
I would have been
all over this one.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.801
Ta-ta!

14:17.100 --> 14:20.534
Why, Peg, why?

14:20.534 --> 14:24.334
Oh, because I thought I saw you
starting to look happy.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.801
I was just pretending.

14:26.801 --> 14:28.701
You of all people
know I'm not happy.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.267
See, it's part of my job

14:30.267 --> 14:32.267
to make the customers
feel special.

14:32.267 --> 14:34.267
It's what I do,
and I'm proud of it.

14:34.267 --> 14:36.100
I'm a pro. I care.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.868
I need shoes.

14:40.868 --> 14:44.133
Yeah, the blacksmith's
right around the corner.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.067
And now we're closed,

14:55.067 --> 14:58.834
and much like my life,
my day is over.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.801
Uh, Dad? In case
of an emergency,

15:00.801 --> 15:02.934
where are
the other exits?

15:02.934 --> 15:04.934
There are
no other exits.

15:04.934 --> 15:06.434
But don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

15:06.434 --> 15:08.934
But if something does,
I've got keys right here...

15:08.934 --> 15:11.434
so you can't
leave me behind.

15:11.434 --> 15:13.934
Now, everybody gets
a sleeping bag.

15:13.934 --> 15:16.434
Don't rush. There's
one for everyone.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.033
Gee, Al, this is great.

15:18.033 --> 15:20.534
When it gets dark,
can we all sit around a boot

15:20.534 --> 15:22.000
and tell ghost stories?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.901
We've got canned meat
from the survival store,

15:25.901 --> 15:27.901
we've got games
from the toy store,

15:27.901 --> 15:30.734
and most importantly,
we've got each other.

the time of our lives.

shoe store!

I'll need quiet.

just let out.

What's the matter?

16:11.901 --> 16:16.901
Haven't you ever seen a family
living in a shoe store before?

16:16.901 --> 16:18.968
A lousy eight bucks.

16:18.968 --> 16:21.968

eight bucks for a hotel.

enough now to go to bed.

stayed in a hotel.

Hey, listen. Don't mess
up these sleeping bags.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.233

with those tags,
