WEBVTT

00:09.443 --> 00:11.079
What is this, "The
Price is Wrong?"

00:11.112 --> 00:15.015
Lower, lower-- hundreds of
dollars lower, you idiot.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.117
Yeah.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.819
I mean, where does she
shop for juke boxes?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.154
Lower!

00:20.188 --> 00:21.889
Lower, you
mouth-breathing pinhead!

00:21.922 --> 00:22.790
Lower!

00:22.823 --> 00:24.058
Higher.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.326
Well, look at that.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.528
If it wasn't for unemployment
and bomb threats called

00:27.561 --> 00:28.762
into the school,
the two of you would

00:28.796 --> 00:30.898
have no quality time together.

00:30.931 --> 00:31.765
Sh.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.001
Time for the showcase showdown.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.636
Oh, take the second showcase.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.971
Everybody knows the
first one sucks.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.874
God, I'd be so good
on this show, Dan.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.244
And they always pick
people just like me,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.679
you know real cute
and bubbly-like.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.149
That's why I
picked you, Mommy.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.083
Oh, man.

00:49.117 --> 00:49.917
Get the hose.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.388
So how'd your interview go?

00:54.422 --> 00:55.989
Guess.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.891
Uh, you got the job
and it pays great?

00:57.925 --> 00:58.859
Lower.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.429
Got the job and
it don't pay great.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.564
Lower.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.633
You went berserk and
kill the interviewer

01:05.666 --> 01:09.203
and now you're going to be
on "America's Most Wanted."

01:09.237 --> 01:11.004
Hey.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.406
Didn't get the job.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.643
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.877
- Hi, Rosie.
- Hi.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.112
Hi, Dan.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.012
Hey, Darlene.

01:19.046 --> 01:19.913
Cool bomb threat, huh?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.885
I've got a favor to ask.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.287
We're going to take
this little trip

01:26.320 --> 01:27.921
and I was wondering if you guys
would watch over the house.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.557
ROSEANNE: Sure.
What are neighbors for.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.891
Where are you headed?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.993
Well, we're taking the motor
home to Branson, Missouri,

01:33.026 --> 01:35.563
the country music
capital of the world.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.964
Man, you guys are so lucky.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.766
We never get to go anyplace.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.769
We ought to pack up our truck
and go over to your house.

01:41.802 --> 01:42.903
Nah.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.207
It'd Just be too hard to
unwind when we got back.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.508
Hey, Darlene.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.076
If you're going to the
kitchen, why don't you and Ty

01:49.109 --> 01:51.512
sit down and make up a list
of things for DJ to do.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.514
Hey, Ty, yeah, you might
as well go ahead and kill

01:53.547 --> 01:55.183
your pets and your plants now.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.787
OK.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.755
Well, do you want
to talk about it?

02:01.789 --> 02:02.823
Oh, honey.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.358
I ain't no damn good
at these interviews.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.959
I get too nervous.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.761
The guy asked me if
I had any hobbies.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.031
I panicked and said, drinking.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.900
Well, you know what they
say, Dan, looking for jobs

02:12.933 --> 02:15.569
is the hardest job
you'll ever have.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.238
You're right.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.473
I need a vacation.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.975
That's not a bad idea.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.177
Let's do it.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.111
Oh, honey.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.379
I can't run away
from my problems.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.280
You sure can.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.615
Your problems are here.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.817
We'll just go someplace
else, it's easy.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.884
Come on.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.553
It's not like we all
don't deserve it.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.789
Well, as long as
it's not Europe again.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.559
Well, actually, I was
thinking about someplace

02:38.592 --> 02:40.628
that's really,
really warm and where

02:40.661 --> 02:46.567
knowing the price of Cheerios
can get you a brand new car.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.168
That's crazy, honey.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.238
We can't afford to
go to California.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.138
Why not?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.072
Ty's going.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.041
No, he's not.

02:54.074 --> 02:54.875
Give me a minute.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.452
So, Ty, I guess you're
going to pack up

03:04.485 --> 03:06.420
a lot of your
warmest clothes to go

03:06.454 --> 03:08.422
down to Branson there
since it's real cold there

03:08.456 --> 03:10.424
this time of year.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.526
It's no colder than here.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.027
Well, how come you
didn't think of like,

03:14.061 --> 03:16.797
you know, going to California
where it's really warm,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.232
you know, and they've
got really cool stuff

03:18.266 --> 03:21.235
there like Disneyland
and the Crystal

03:21.269 --> 03:24.505
Cathedral and Bob Barker.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.740
You know, Charlotte and
I begged him to go there,

03:26.774 --> 03:28.208
not stupid Branson.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.144
Well, I think you girls would
probably like it in Branson

03:31.178 --> 03:33.647
because there's a lot of, you
know, musicians down there

03:33.681 --> 03:38.151
and they have their days free
and they probably really like

03:38.185 --> 03:41.021
making little friends like you.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.055
Yeah.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.324
I wouldn't let my
daughters go there.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.526
But hey, that's just me.

03:45.559 --> 03:50.531
Hey, I rad that Jerry
Lee Lewis lives down there.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.699
Look, guys, I--

03:51.732 --> 03:54.502
I've got nothing against
California necessarily,

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
but it's just too far for
me to drive all by myself.

04:00.941 --> 04:05.178
(SINGING) California,
here I come, right back

04:05.212 --> 04:07.881
where we started from.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.385
Open up your Golden Gate.

04:11.419 --> 04:17.358
California, here we come.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.760
[theme music]

05:08.642 --> 05:10.611
Hey, son.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.179
Hey.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.615
What kind of bug was that?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.484
I don't know, Deej.

05:16.517 --> 05:20.320
Did we hit it or
did it fly into us?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.722
I'm not sure, son.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.726
He did seem kind of depressed
before he hit the windshield.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.095
What's that?

05:28.128 --> 05:30.398
That's the, uh, air
conditioner switch.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.733
[air blowing]

05:36.370 --> 05:37.371
OK, Deej.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.907
Go back and bother
your mo for a while.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.543
Mom, can you make
me a tuna sandwich?

05:42.576 --> 05:45.112
I lost my other one.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.080
Darlene, could you get
me another can of tuna

05:47.114 --> 05:49.349
out of the cupboard, please?

05:49.383 --> 05:52.920
Now, let's see, which
one's the cupboard,

05:52.953 --> 05:54.788
which one's the den?

05:54.822 --> 05:55.689
Hurry up.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.590
I'm starving.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.691
DJ. do you mind?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.527
I'm working on three
inches of Formica here.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.495
I've got to finish
this and Darlene's

06:01.529 --> 06:04.832
salad, Jackie's grilled
cheese, and your dad's

06:04.865 --> 06:06.700
bologna sandwich.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.235
Hey, skip the bologna.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.770
I'll take some of that tuna.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.204
I've got to use
up the bologna, Dan,

06:11.238 --> 06:14.908
otherwise DJ will have
no place to sleep.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.010
Hey, you know
what I feel like?

06:17.044 --> 06:17.945
Some hot cocoa.

06:17.978 --> 06:18.912
can we have some hot cocoa?

06:18.946 --> 06:19.813
Yeah.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.181
I want some cocoa.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.082
No.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.617
No cocoa.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.053
Jeez, what kind of a
vacation is this for me?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.755
All you've done is take
everything I do at home

06:27.788 --> 06:30.090
and just put it on wheels.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.592
Well, [inaudible] quit.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.894
You in charge now.

06:33.927 --> 06:34.795
Great.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.396
Now one of us has to make lunch.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.566
Why don't you two flip for it?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.367
Oh.
Charlotte will do it.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.334
OK.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.539
She just tells you to do
something and you do it?

06:45.573 --> 06:46.674
Well, I don't really mind.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.877
I mean, I do this stuff
at home all the time.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.580
Let me explain something
to you, Charlotte.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.448
You're the older sister.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.383
That means you get to
treat her like garbage.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.085
It's your birthright.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.988
Yeah, but that's not
how this family works.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.290
No, that's how
all families work.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.460
Becky got to treat me bad,
I got to take it out on DJ,

07:06.494 --> 07:10.564
and DJ gets to take it
out on society as a whole.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.501
I think I'm going to go
see if Dad wants some tea.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.535
I can't believe this.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.670
You two are so screwed up.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.605
We are not.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.506
Oh, please.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.707
Why do you think
she eats so much

07:19.740 --> 07:20.808
and you'll sleep
with any guy who

07:20.841 --> 07:24.277
gives you a little attention?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.546
Go shove it, Darlene.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.980
Where the hell do you
get so much insight?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.357
Trust me, I know.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.267
Isn't this great, honey, just
you and me on the open road?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.773
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.709
Look at all those
little houses out there.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.845
You ever wonder what
kind of people live there

07:57.878 --> 07:59.713
and what they're
doing right now?

07:59.747 --> 08:01.882
I know what they're
doing right now.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.817
They're wondering why the
hell they bought houses

08:03.851 --> 08:07.354
so damn close to the freeway.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.757
You know who live
in those houses?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.859
People just like us.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.127
Each one of those little
houses has its own Becky

08:14.161 --> 08:17.297
and Darlene, its own DJ.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.133
How come they still
get to have a Becky?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.935
I guess their little
bike shops are doing well.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.741
boy, stuff sure has
changed, hasn't it?

08:27.775 --> 08:31.812
Remember that big plan I worked
out when we first got married?

08:31.845 --> 08:34.314
Yeah.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.783
What was that again?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.751
I think it was we'll get by.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.052
Oh, yeah.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.221
What ever happened to that?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.122
Hey, come on.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.957
We're doing OK.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.327
You got your restaurant now,
it's doing good, making money.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.098
Let's have a baby.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.870
What?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.206
Are you serious?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.474
Since when you want
to have another kid?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.343
Well, I was just thinking
about how much fun it

09:03.376 --> 09:05.145
was when the kids were little.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.814
Yeah, but then they
get big, remember?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.816
I'm not get burned
on that deal again.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.988
So what are you
saying, that we're never

09:15.022 --> 09:15.956
going to have anymore children?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.393
Maybe I am.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.463
Are you the only one
that can decide that?

09:23.496 --> 09:24.364
You got a uterus?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.872
Well, that's
pretty damn unfair.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.241
I don't see why
we can't do this.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.143
Kids take the money, Dan, OK?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.378
And we don't have
that much of it.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.447
If we did, do you think we'd
be driving cross country

09:40.480 --> 09:43.951
with our neighbor's toilet?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.419
When we had our first
kid, things were tough.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.922
We didn't have any trouble
making that decision.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.324
We didn't make
that decision, Dan.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.592
Jose Cuervo did.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.897
What a coincidence.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.431
He's the same guy
that proposed to you.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.780
You drive real good.

10:12.813 --> 10:16.650
I used to do this
professionally.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.485
I can tell.

10:18.518 --> 10:23.056
I keep watching your eyes and
they never leave the road.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.391
They are so brown.

10:26.994 --> 10:27.795
Thanks.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.836
It's funny,
isn't it, traveling

10:35.869 --> 10:37.938
around in a motor home?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.107
This is the first time I ever
spent the night with a woman

10:40.140 --> 10:42.309
that I didn't
actually date first.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.011
That's funny.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.512
that is funny.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.348
Can we get some drinks up here?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.684
I got it.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.020
Boy, I think my dad
and your Aunt Jackie

10:53.053 --> 10:54.121
are really hitting it off.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.956
Wouldn't it be bizarre
if they got married?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.324
Yeah.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.226
Then we'd be cousins and we
lived next door to each other

10:59.259 --> 11:01.394
so we could share clothes
and talk on the phone

11:01.428 --> 11:04.531
and do each other's hair.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.835
Die, dwarf.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.269
Who wants more peas?

11:09.302 --> 11:11.238
You mean some
more baby peas, some

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
of those cute little baby peas?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.541
I'd love some more baby peas.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.209
I mean, even though you're
done, that doesn't mean

11:16.243 --> 11:18.879
I don't want anymore baby peas.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.681
I'd like some more baby peas.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.616
Well, you'll have baby
peas when I tell you

11:23.650 --> 11:26.386
you're good and ready
to have baby peas.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.487
All right, then.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.488
Carrots.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.656
What the hell are
we talking about?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.458
Nothing.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.625
Hey, Dave.
[gasp]

11:32.659 --> 11:33.526
Oh.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.795
Hi, Vic.

11:34.828 --> 11:35.695
Oh my god.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.497
Who the hell are you?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.767
I met him at the
last truck stop.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.204
I let him use our bathroom and I
guess I forgot he was in there.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.506
DJ, what were you thinking?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.976
You guys got any tobacco?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.043
Jackie, pull over.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.378
We've got to let somebody out.
- No, no.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.645
Wait a minute.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.581
We can't just dump him in
the middle of the desert.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.749
Where you headed, buddy?

11:55.783 --> 11:58.118
Well, anywhere over
the border would be fine.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.320
Jackie, pull over.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.790
Just a joke.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.124
You're outta here, buddy.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.525
Hold on.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
I'm going to check his bag, make
sure he didn't take anything.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.464
You better hope
you're clean, mister.

12:11.498 --> 12:15.035
Well, how do we compare to
other families you've killed?

12:15.068 --> 12:18.005
You know, ma'am, you
might not believe this,

12:18.038 --> 12:21.775
but I used to be just
like you people I had

12:21.809 --> 12:23.977
a family, wife, kids, home--

12:24.011 --> 12:26.079
whole deal.

12:26.113 --> 12:31.351
then I lost my job, wife
took the kids, things

12:31.384 --> 12:32.920
started going to hell, and--

12:32.953 --> 12:34.988
well-- I find myself here.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.060
Gee, Ty, why
don't you go ahead

12:40.093 --> 12:42.162
and start driving for a while?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.697
TY: You got it.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.266
I don't think it would
hurt nothing to have you

12:46.299 --> 12:48.936
ride with us for a little bit.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.604
Can I get you something to eat?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.505
Well, yeah.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.874
I'd appreciate that.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.977
Do you know where
your family is now?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.211
Nah.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.947
I was-- I was lying about
the family and the job.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.649
My-- my problem's always been
the liquor and the pills.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.154
Ty, pull over
at the next exit.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.189
He's getting out.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.790
He's clean, Roseanne.

13:10.824 --> 13:11.791
Very well organized.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.664
Well, putting eight
people in a 20-foot

13:17.697 --> 13:21.334
space together for five days
seemed like a good idea.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.136
What went wrong?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.338
Well, for one thing,
you put me in a motor home

13:25.372 --> 13:28.876
with a man who hasn't
had a woman in 15 years.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.345
Then Jackie, can you just
keep your distance from him?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.814
It's not like I don't try.

13:34.848 --> 13:40.387
You know, yesterday I
almost lost him at the sink.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.654
Just deal with it, OK?

13:41.688 --> 13:42.689
I have my own problems.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.257
Like for instance,
Dan's driving me

13:44.291 --> 13:46.759
crazy about having another kid.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.061
Oh, this is great.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.762
You're going to have four
kids before I even have one.

13:49.796 --> 13:54.667
Well, for your information, I'm
thinking about getting a cat.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.604
Well, I didn't say
I was going to do it.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.307
Of course I didn't say I
wasn't going to do it, either.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.508
What's that mean?

14:01.541 --> 14:02.709
Well, I'm thinking about it.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.212
You know, I've got a
whole bunch of experience.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.347
boy, I'd do things
different this time.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.616
Like for instance, I wouldn't
teach this kid to talk.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.322
You really think
you should do this?

14:15.355 --> 14:18.691
Jackie, look at the three
kids I've already raised.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.527
Don't I deserve a
shot at a good one?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.278
Well, good news.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.514
I called home and
nobody answered.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.250
Everything OK at the diner?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.484
That's the better news.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.953
You know that job
you didn't get?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.054
You got it.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.588
The guy left a
message at the diner

14:48.621 --> 14:50.457
that their first
choice fell through.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.524
Congratulations, honey.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.327
You're second best.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.228
Great.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.429
Yeah.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.031
And it's steady drywall
work with medical benefits

14:58.065 --> 14:59.366
and everything.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.001
So now we can finally afford
to get one of them expensive

15:01.034 --> 15:03.703
illnesses we talked about.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.105
And I was thinking,
you know, since we

15:05.138 --> 15:09.676
have two incomes that, uh, maybe
I'll talk about that baby thing

15:09.709 --> 15:12.645
you wanted.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.015
I'm not taking
the job, Roseanne.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.950
What do you mean you're
not taking the job?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.918
Just what I said,
I'm not taking the job.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.288
You've been dragging around
the house for a whole month

15:21.321 --> 15:22.922
complaining how you
ain't got no work,

15:22.956 --> 15:24.857
then you start that
baby talk and get

15:24.891 --> 15:28.395
my eggs all in an uproar.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.230
You are taking that job, Dan.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.266
I'm not taking the job
just because you want a baby.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.901
I want a baby?

15:34.934 --> 15:38.071
You're the one that started
the whole baby thing.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.706
I don't want a baby anymore.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.008
Oh.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.875
Well, I'm glad that you made
up your mind before somebody

15:42.909 --> 15:46.146
said, here comes the head.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.680
I don't want to talk
about this anymore, OK?

15:47.714 --> 15:48.581
Let's drop it.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.616
Well, I do.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.883
I said, let's drop it!

15:57.157 --> 15:59.959
What the hell
is wrong with you?

15:59.993 --> 16:02.529
Why the hell did you say
you want to have a baby?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.631
I don't know.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.434
Maybe I thought having a
baby would make me happy.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.738
I could have just as easily
said a new car or pool table.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.142
Maybe I just needed
something to look forward to.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.077
What, and getting paid
to be out of the house

16:17.110 --> 16:20.180
eight hours a day
isn't enough for you?

16:20.213 --> 16:21.948
Not drywall.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.416
Well, you don't
have to do it forever.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.753
You could just do it till
something better comes along.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.121
There's guys there
that have been doing

16:28.155 --> 16:31.191
the same thing for 30 years
waiting for something better

16:31.224 --> 16:32.392
to come along.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.627
I lose my bike shop,
the first thing I do

16:34.661 --> 16:37.597
is go back to drywall.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.168
Yeah, well, what do
you really want to do?

16:41.201 --> 16:44.937
Roseanne, there's
a theme here.

16:44.971 --> 16:45.838
I don't know.

16:48.908 --> 16:49.976
Dan, you're scaring me.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.416
Hey, you think you're scared?

16:56.449 --> 16:59.552
Well, wherever it is that
you don't know where the hell

16:59.586 --> 17:03.590
you're going to, you know that
I'm right there behind you.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.424
Thanks.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.998
Still want to have a baby?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.166
I don't know.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.567
Now you've got me thinking
about a pool table.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.643
yeah.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.312
I can't believe Dan didn't
get me no ticket to "The Price

17:25.345 --> 17:26.413
is Right."

17:26.446 --> 17:27.647
How was I supposed
to know you had to get

17:27.680 --> 17:29.582
tickets six months in advance?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.384
Besides, you love this
Jackie Thomas guy.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.153
Yeah, but I can
watch that on TV.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.322
I want to go someplace
where I can win something.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.823
At least you got
to fulfill the kids'

17:36.856 --> 17:38.024
dream of going to Disneyland.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.192
Yeah, I love that.

17:39.226 --> 17:43.096
Darlene versus the
happiest place on Earth.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.063
[applause]

17:44.097 --> 17:45.532
Hey, everybody.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.967
How you doing?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.337
How you doing, folks?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.273
I'm Jackie Thomas, as you know.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.242
Welcome to my show.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.477
We're going to get started
here in a couple of minutes,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.646
but I'd like to get to know
you guys a little bit better.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.947
Sir, what's your name?

18:00.980 --> 18:01.881
Bill.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.849
Bill.

18:02.882 --> 18:03.950
Nice haircut, buddy.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.519
What did you do, lose
a bet or something?

18:06.553 --> 18:07.654
No.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.055
I was in a car accident
and before they

18:09.088 --> 18:10.957
could operate on my skull,
they had to save my head.

18:10.990 --> 18:11.924
Whatever.

18:11.958 --> 18:15.728
You know, what's
your name, partner?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.198
- Dan Connor.
- Dan Connor.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.666
Where are you from, Dan?

18:19.699 --> 18:20.600
Lanford, Illinois.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.335
Lanford, Illinois.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.304
Is this, uh, your
lovely wife here?

18:24.337 --> 18:27.039
Yes, I am.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.375
How long you been
married, ma'am?

18:28.408 --> 18:31.010
Uh, well, next month
it'll be 20 years.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.546
20 years, everybody.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.583
Tell us, what's the secret
to a marriage like that?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.884
Uh, lack of imagination.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.252
Lack of imagination.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.353
That's funny.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.688
You know, I myself have
never been married.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
I've been working on my career
too hard to take the time.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
I'll tell you, it hasn't always
been this good for me, either.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.727
I used to do a
lot of lousy jobs.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.996
I washed dishes, I worked
in a meat packing plant,

18:50.029 --> 18:51.431
I did everything
short of drywall.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.899
It was pretty ugly.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.601
But now I'm a big
star and I can make

18:54.634 --> 18:56.603
anybody do anything I want.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.305
Who here wants to do
something really stupid

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
for a real lame prize?
- Uh, he does.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.009
He, he does impressions.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.143
JACKIE THOMAS: Impressions?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.645
Dan, get up here and do
one of your impressions.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.579
Yeah.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.615
Do one of your impressions.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.083
Come on up here, Dan.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.086
All right, Danny.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.055
Impression time.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.024
What do you do?

19:18.057 --> 19:20.993
Uh-- uh--

19:21.027 --> 19:22.562
Mr. Howell from
"Gilligan's Island."

19:22.595 --> 19:24.431
Mr. Howell from
"Gilligan's Island."

19:24.464 --> 19:25.398
Well, I'll help you out here.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.666
I'll be the Skipper.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.235
How you doing, little buddy?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.135
Smashing, Lovey.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.538
[applause]

19:32.639 --> 19:34.073
Yaa!

19:34.106 --> 19:37.577
Hey, do you do anybody else?

19:37.610 --> 19:41.013
Yeah, I guess a little Brando.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.049
Brando?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.917
I'd to thank the heads
of the five families

19:44.951 --> 19:46.386
for coming here this evening.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.587
How did we even get this far.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.121
[applause]

19:50.156 --> 19:52.191
Thank you.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.092
Hey.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.227
Hey, you know what?

19:54.261 --> 19:55.695
If you like this one,
you'll love this one.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.831
This is a-- a little
character of mine,

19:58.865 --> 20:01.534
a real nutty little guy named
Travis Bickle from a movie

20:01.568 --> 20:02.669
called "Taxi Driver."

20:02.702 --> 20:05.171
[applause]

20:05.204 --> 20:07.274
And that goes a little
something like this.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.447
Are you talking to me?

20:14.481 --> 20:15.848
Are you talking to me?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.617
Hey, are you talking to me?

20:17.650 --> 20:18.585
[applause]

20:18.618 --> 20:20.520
Thank you very much.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.954
--had a steamboat.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.890
The steamboat had a bell.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.293
Miss Lucy went to Heaven,
the steamboat went to--

20:26.326 --> 20:27.594
OK, that's good.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.095
All right.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.498
Here's your t-shirts.

20:31.531 --> 20:34.434
One for each of you,
that's good enough.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.836
Anybody else got anything neat?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.305
All right.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.739
All right.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.874
That's two scripts,
signed scripts.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.310
You've got the two t-shirts.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.244
Anybody else want to--

20:45.278 --> 20:47.113
[laughing]

20:50.116 --> 20:51.484
--hello, operator.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.059
(SINGING) Goodbye, my friend.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.330
It's hard to die.

21:03.363 --> 21:08.167
When all the others
are singing in the sky.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.905
Let the seasons in the air.

21:12.939 --> 21:17.344
Pretty girls are everywhere,
look for me and I'll be there.

21:17.377 --> 21:22.048
We had joy, we had fun,
we had seasons in the sun.

21:22.081 --> 21:25.985
And the hills and
the [inaudible]..

21:26.018 --> 21:30.523
We had joy, we had fun,
we had seasons in the sun

21:30.557 --> 21:33.960
and the hills that we climbed
were just seasons out of time.

21:33.993 --> 21:37.830
We had joy, we had fun,
we had seasons in the sun

21:37.864 --> 21:39.499
and the hills that
we climbed were

21:39.532 --> 21:41.200
like the seasons out of time.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.170
We had joy, we had
fun, we had seasons

21:44.203 --> 21:47.374
in the sun and the
hills that we climbed

21:47.407 --> 21:48.508
like the seasons out of time.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.610
We had joy--
