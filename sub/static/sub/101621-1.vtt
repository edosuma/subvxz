We can't have a dog
because as I've said before,

03:51.714 --> 03:53.506
all dogs make my throat
close up,

03:53.589 --> 03:55.839
so no air gets to my lungs,
which makes me die.

03:55.923 --> 03:57.714
So it's--
It's undesirable.

03:57.798 --> 03:59.881

a road trip, too?
Just you and me?

Oh, school auction.
Did I mention I'm not going?

-Oh, did I mention you are?
-I think you'll find I'm not,
my love.

04:48.381 --> 04:50.297
Isn't it enough
we give them tons
of money anyway?

04:50.381 --> 04:52.130
We actually don't
give them money.

which is very sweet of him.

Which reminds me,
we have dinner with him
next Thursday.

Right. So I have
Reardon and your dad
in the same week.

in New York.

You, you like your school?

-Yeah.
-Grace: Hey.

05:07.714 --> 05:09.130
And I love it.
Go on, kiss your mom.

05:09.214 --> 05:10.464
-We have to go.
-Mom--

05:10.547 --> 05:12.047
No, I'm not kissing Mom.
You do it.

05:12.130 --> 05:13.130
You need to clean this up.

05:13.214 --> 05:14.714
I'm not doing this
every single morning.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.506
No, no, I want to kiss you.
I like this.

05:16.589 --> 05:18.172
Yeah. Right.

05:18.255 --> 05:19.798
-Henry? Henry?
-Henry: What?

05:19.881 --> 05:22.964
No more smoothies.
You never, ever clean up...

05:23.047 --> 05:24.631
Jonathan: All right,
here's a question
and don't lie.

05:24.714 --> 05:27.839
Did you, in fact,
practice that thing
at all this week?

05:27.923 --> 05:29.130
Because I heard nothing.

05:29.214 --> 05:30.214
No, I practiced.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.714
-Really?
-Yeah. I swear.

05:34.005 --> 05:36.297
Do you know,
he doesn't even
think I'm any good.

05:36.381 --> 05:37.881
Mr. Rosenbaum.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.547
He actually said that, did he?

05:39.631 --> 05:41.673
No. It's not that he says it.

05:41.756 --> 05:45.798
It just-- He used to say
a lot more good stuff.

05:45.881 --> 05:48.756
I mean, sometimes
with the looks he gives me,

05:48.839 --> 05:50.255
I-I think
he wants me to quit.

05:50.339 --> 05:53.172
Well, is it possible that,
as your mom might say--

05:53.255 --> 05:55.422
(imitating Grace):
You're actually
projecting that sentiment.

05:55.506 --> 05:57.506
Because somewhere deep down,

05:57.589 --> 06:00.089
in the bowels of
your teenage psyche,

06:00.172 --> 06:01.172
you actually want to give it up.

06:01.255 --> 06:03.714
I don't want to give up.
I love violin.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.255
(in normal voice):
Okay, well,
that's great then.

06:05.339 --> 06:07.089
You know, Rosenbaum,
he's an unhappy man.

06:07.172 --> 06:08.631
It is never a good idea

06:08.714 --> 06:10.172
to take measure of ourselves

06:10.255 --> 06:11.714
through the eyes of the joyless.

06:11.798 --> 06:14.422
Well, you can be joyless.

06:16.255 --> 06:18.005
-Beg your pardon?
-Yeah.

06:18.089 --> 06:20.673
You can be joyless
when you're--
when you're stressed.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.881
Do I seem stressed a lot?

06:22.964 --> 06:25.631
Some... lately.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.214
Huh.

06:27.297 --> 06:28.589
Brilliant. Well, now--

06:28.673 --> 06:30.756
Now I'm stressed about
being stressed, so...

06:30.839 --> 06:32.881
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

06:32.964 --> 06:35.631
You don't, you don't play
your violin for Rosenbaum,
anyway.

06:35.714 --> 06:37.756
You owe him your respect
and your hard work,

06:37.839 --> 06:40.381
but in the end,
your relationship with song

06:40.464 --> 06:42.506
is between you
and your music.

06:42.589 --> 06:45.089
-Got it.
-Right. And you're
brilliant, okay?

06:45.172 --> 06:46.214
So fuck Rosenbaum.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.422
-I'm telling Mom you said that.
-Take your violin,

06:48.506 --> 06:50.798
and shove it up his
Rosen-bum cheeks, okay?

Fucking forbid!

07:39.047 --> 07:42.964
So you're back to

that he's bipolar.

and I'm not exactly sure where,
other than a direction

08:10.381 --> 08:13.047
not in my favor.
So just say it.

08:21.005 --> 08:24.881
I have met few people
more discriminating than you.

08:24.964 --> 08:29.422
You read 100 Yelp reviews
before choosing someone
to install your carpet.

08:29.506 --> 08:32.631
Am I right?
You, you try on
20 pairs of shoes

08:32.714 --> 08:34.047
before making a choice.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.464
You do background checks
on your hair colorist.

08:36.547 --> 08:38.214
You did a background check
on me, no doubt.

08:38.297 --> 08:40.589
You vet everything.
Everything.

08:40.673 --> 08:44.047
-Which is fine. I mean,
that's appropriate.
-But...

08:44.130 --> 08:47.089
But an attractive man
comes along,

08:47.172 --> 08:50.089
and shows an interest in you,
and judgment be gone.

08:50.172 --> 08:51.798
No. That is not
what is happening.

08:51.881 --> 08:54.005
I mean, the day
that you met Kevin,

08:54.089 --> 08:55.881
you floated into this office.

08:55.964 --> 08:57.798
It was an appointment
that was made to deal

08:57.881 --> 09:00.130
with the anguish
of husband number two,

09:00.214 --> 09:03.214
only to declare that you'd met
husband number three.

09:03.297 --> 09:04.964
So, I'm saying...

09:05.881 --> 09:08.506
Maybe it's possible...

09:08.589 --> 09:12.089
that you're less of a victim
of Kevin's moods than
you are of your own.

09:12.172 --> 09:14.089
So, excuse me,
this is my fault?

09:14.172 --> 09:16.631
-No.
-It is. You're blaming me.

09:16.714 --> 09:19.381
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just saying
there's a particular

09:19.464 --> 09:21.130
type of person that
you want to be with,

09:21.214 --> 09:22.714
and maybe you're
a little too quick

09:22.798 --> 09:25.047
to see that person
in the men that you meet,

09:25.130 --> 09:27.464
instead of seeing
what's actually there.

Grace (over phone):
UGH. WELL, I'LL PROBABLY
NEVER SEE HER AGAIN

BECAUSE THEY HIRE YOU
TO GIVE THEM THE HARD TRUTHS,

09:36.506 --> 09:38.923
AND THEN, THEN THEY FIRE YOU
FOR DELIVERING THEM.

09:39.005 --> 09:40.589
Well, just--
just up your prices.

09:40.673 --> 09:43.673
The more exclusive you seem,
the more she'll come begging.

09:43.756 --> 09:46.964
Wow. (chuckles)

09:47.047 --> 09:48.464
The, um,

09:48.547 --> 09:52.381
the dress code
for the fundraiser
is fancy-glam.

I'm not wearing a tux.

09:53.756 --> 09:55.714
Grace:
LISTEN, THIS IS FOR
HENRY'S SCHOOL.

09:55.798 --> 09:58.047
If I can tough out
a ladies' tea,

09:58.130 --> 10:01.089
you can stomach one fundraiser.
For Henry.

10:01.172 --> 10:03.756
I will do it.
But not for Henry's school.

10:03.839 --> 10:05.506
I will do it for you.

10:05.589 --> 10:06.881
Because you're hot.

10:06.964 --> 10:09.839
Anyway, I'm here.
Okay?

10:09.923 --> 10:11.881

-Let me take your coat.
-Yes.

10:25.923 --> 10:27.714
They're waiting for you
upstairs.

-Oh.

10:36.714 --> 10:38.214
A Scholarship.

10:38.297 --> 10:40.547
She brought her infant.
She's changing her
in the bathroom.

10:40.631 --> 10:42.089
You look fabulous.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.547
-Oh, hi, Grace.
-Grace: Hi.

10:43.631 --> 10:45.255
-Hi.
-Grace: Is she, uh,
on the committee?

10:45.339 --> 10:47.506
Uh, wants to be
an involved parent.

10:47.589 --> 10:49.381
Hi. Hi, hi. Sorry.

10:49.798 --> 10:51.297
-Hey.
-Thanks.

10:51.381 --> 10:53.506
Sylvia:
Did any of you even know
that she was coming?

10:53.589 --> 10:55.798
I mean, I'm usually
the first one to
learn of anything.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.297
People can't wait
to tell me stuff.

10:57.381 --> 10:59.631
Amanda:
Because you're so quick
to disapprove.

10:59.714 --> 11:01.798
Well, exactly.

11:01.881 --> 11:03.631
Diane:
All right, we should
get going here.

11:03.714 --> 11:04.839
Woman:
Sorry!

11:04.923 --> 11:06.130
Sylvia:
She's a bit nervous.

11:06.214 --> 11:08.130
She's back to being
the auctioneer.

11:08.214 --> 11:10.089
Jolene:
I thought you got
the guy from Sotheby's.

No, he dropped out.
We'll be fine.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.756

-Hi.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.255
Hi. Hi.

11:15.339 --> 11:17.172
I'm Grace Fraser.

11:17.255 --> 11:19.381
Elena Alves.
Nice to meet you.

11:19.464 --> 11:21.339
-Hi.
-Elena has a boy
in fourth grade?

11:21.422 --> 11:23.130
You said his name was Miguel?

11:23.214 --> 11:25.756
-Yeah, yeah.
-Your baby's gorgeous.

11:25.839 --> 11:27.547
-Thank you.
-Hello. Boy or girl?

11:27.631 --> 11:29.005
Girl. Teresa.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.631
Oh. Teresa.

11:30.714 --> 11:32.881
-I love your eyelashes.
-Okay, come on, folks.

11:32.964 --> 11:34.130
The auction's tomorrow.

11:34.214 --> 11:35.923
Thank you so much
for letting me join.

11:36.005 --> 11:39.089
Are you kidding?
We're happy to get
all the help we can.

11:39.172 --> 11:41.798
That you even have the time
with two kids.

11:41.881 --> 11:43.923
I have twins. So regret it.

11:44.005 --> 11:46.464
-Jolene!
-(all chuckling)

11:46.547 --> 11:48.798
I mean, they're
so much work, right?

11:48.881 --> 11:50.673
Sylvia:
Okay, let's, uh...

11:50.756 --> 11:51.964
let's rank the items.

11:52.047 --> 11:53.839
-Yes.
-We'll start with
the least expensive.

11:53.923 --> 11:57.214
Work our way up to the...
the big tickets.

11:57.297 --> 11:58.798
Amanda:
There's a lot of stuff here.

11:58.881 --> 12:02.130
Well, we have over 200
people confirmed coming.
That's a record.

12:02.214 --> 12:04.798
Thanks to the Spensers
lending us their home.

12:04.881 --> 12:06.714
I did a walk-through yesterday.
Oh, my God.

12:06.798 --> 12:08.089
Mm. Did you see
the David Hockneys?

12:08.172 --> 12:10.214
Two of them,
on facing walls
in the dining room.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.756
-And what about Suki's closet?
-Oh, I'll get there.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.339
Maybe Monday night,
with any luck.

12:14.422 --> 12:15.798
-Yes!
-(all chattering)

12:15.881 --> 12:17.214
Diane:
Okay, let's do this. Okay!

12:17.297 --> 12:21.130
(clears throat)
We got four separate stays
in the Hamptons.

12:21.214 --> 12:23.214
A pair in Vail and Aspen.

12:23.297 --> 12:25.589
A cooking lesson at Tribeca
for eight.

12:25.673 --> 12:27.214
You never know how much
those go for.

12:27.297 --> 12:28.547
Amanda:
Stem-cell facelift.

12:28.631 --> 12:29.839
Does anybody really
believe in those?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.547
Jolene:
Kathy Sennot got one.
Did not work.

12:32.631 --> 12:34.130
Sally:
We have a bunch of consults.

12:34.214 --> 12:36.714
A college admissions counselor.
A pre-school admissions
counselor.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.506
A genealogist that'll
come to your house.

12:38.589 --> 12:39.964
-That could actually go.
-(baby crying)

12:40.047 --> 12:41.881
Jolene:
I don't see any artists.
Where are the artists?

12:41.964 --> 12:43.589
Sylvia:
Are you saying
we can't scratch up

12:43.673 --> 12:45.839
one lousy playwright
in all of New York City?

12:45.923 --> 12:48.422
Grace, maybe you could donate
a therapy session.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.756
I am not doing that.
That is not happening.

12:50.839 --> 12:53.339
Why not? "Do I hear $500
on saving your marriage?"

12:53.422 --> 12:55.798
Uh, 500, and I will
throw in my husband.

12:55.881 --> 12:57.506
Sally:
Grace, you know
what would be awesome?

12:57.589 --> 12:59.464
I think Jonathan
would be a huge get.

12:59.547 --> 13:01.130
You want to auction Jonathan?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.756
-Sally: Well...
-Yes! I'm putting him up.

13:03.839 --> 13:05.798
Uh, Grace's husband is a doctor.

13:05.881 --> 13:07.756
-He was featured in
"New York" magazine.
-Oh.

13:07.839 --> 13:11.756
Sylvia:
He's an oncologist, Sally.
Who's gonna bid on cancer?

13:11.839 --> 13:14.923
Amanda:
A private, after-hours tour
at the Guggenheim.

13:15.005 --> 13:17.714
They're doing the Salon
de la Rose Croix.

13:17.798 --> 13:21.130
You know, I was just there
on Tuesday for the Chagall
exhibit.

13:21.214 --> 13:23.756
I swear, I actually
felt light-headed.

13:23.839 --> 13:25.798
Sally:
I don't really get Chagall.

13:25.881 --> 13:28.089
Amanda (laughing):
I mean, who doesn't get Chagall?

13:28.172 --> 13:30.798
Jolene:
Me. One minute he's a modernist.

13:30.881 --> 13:34.214
Then it's stained glass.
The guy's all over the place.

13:34.297 --> 13:37.339

they'd put him on Prozac...

No.

Sylvia:
WELL NOW WITH THE BABY.
BEFORE WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.214

reading a book.

It is a crime not to be
frantically busy."
Who just...

SITS AROUND QUIETLY?

14:49.673 --> 14:51.714
What an unfathomable

15:32.673 --> 15:34.631
Elena, what's wrong?

15:41.381 --> 15:44.839
Grace:
IT WAS HOSTILE.
IT JUST WAS.

15:44.923 --> 15:47.214
But I don't blame her.
I mean, we were
talking about art.

15:47.297 --> 15:50.881
We were talking about money.
It was, it was pretty vulgar.

15:50.964 --> 15:53.172
And she was just
trying to say,
"Hey, here I am.

15:53.255 --> 15:55.589
"I'm a real, real woman.
I'm a real mom.

15:55.673 --> 15:57.506

(clicks tongue)

15:57.589 --> 16:00.798

we should move out of the city.

Said the most New York person
I've ever met in my life.

16:07.089 --> 16:08.798
No, but don't you
worry sometimes

16:08.881 --> 16:10.839
that you're raising your son
in a bubble?

16:10.923 --> 16:13.964
I thought that was the whole
essence of modern parenting,
isn't it?

16:14.047 --> 16:16.673
Keep them protected from reality
for as long as possible

16:16.756 --> 16:17.964
so that when they
finally emerge,

16:18.047 --> 16:19.714
they can't cope
and end up self-harming.

16:19.798 --> 16:22.506

really well at that.
-Mm.

16:22.589 --> 16:25.839

Schenectady, huh?

16:25.923 --> 16:29.756
-I've heard nice things
about Schenectady.
-It sounds horrible.

16:29.839 --> 16:32.089
Even phonetically.

16:32.172 --> 16:34.422
So, is this
a serious conversation?

16:34.506 --> 16:36.047
Yeah.

16:36.130 --> 16:39.005
Yep. Manhattan is
a lonely place.

16:39.089 --> 16:40.464
I mean,
when you think about it,

16:40.547 --> 16:42.798
we don't have a lot
of close friends.

16:42.881 --> 16:45.631
Well, that's only 'cause
we hate everyone.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.798
You hate everyone.
I don't.

16:48.881 --> 16:51.172
I wouldn't call us isolated.

16:51.255 --> 16:53.547
Our days are stuffed
with people and their problems.

16:53.631 --> 16:56.964
I mean, we're right up close
with them at their most
vulnerable.

16:57.047 --> 16:58.547
It's not a conventional
social life,

16:58.631 --> 17:00.673
but in terms of meaningful
human interaction,

17:00.756 --> 17:02.422
I would say we did
very well.

17:03.464 --> 17:06.339
-Mm.
-I don't like you being lonely.

21:54.297 --> 21:55.756
(Grace laughs)

21:55.839 --> 21:57.422
Well, thank you for coming.

21:57.506 --> 21:59.005
I'm not coming.
I'm going.

21:59.089 --> 22:02.005
-Grace: Really? Now?
-I bid on the
silent auction.

22:02.089 --> 22:06.047
I'm apt to win one of
Henry Ford's
original dipsticks.

22:06.130 --> 22:09.798
-Grace: Mm.
-I would like to be long gone
before that happens.

22:09.881 --> 22:11.547
-Jonathan.
-Franklin.

22:11.631 --> 22:12.756
You're looking well.

22:12.839 --> 22:14.047
I am?

22:14.130 --> 22:15.673
Uh, very surprising.
Thank you.

22:15.756 --> 22:18.506
-Dinner Thursday?
-Absolutely.

22:18.589 --> 22:19.714
-Hello.
-Hi.

22:19.798 --> 22:22.089
-Hi. Hi, hi.
-Franklin: Hi, darling.

22:22.923 --> 22:24.506
-Jonathan.
-Franklin.

22:24.589 --> 22:26.381
You're not gonna
fucking believe this.

22:26.464 --> 22:28.172
-Grace: What?
-They're not even here.

22:28.255 --> 22:30.005
-Grace: Who?
-The Spensers.

22:30.089 --> 22:31.172
Oh.

22:31.255 --> 22:32.756
What, you don't think
that's rude?

22:32.839 --> 22:34.881
We could take it as rude
or it could be,

22:34.964 --> 22:37.047
"While we're gonna be
out of town,

22:37.130 --> 22:39.506
happy to let you
use our palace."

22:39.589 --> 22:41.506
Can't you ever
just be not nice?

22:41.589 --> 22:43.339
-Oh, she can, I promise you.
-(laughing)

22:43.422 --> 22:44.964
You hear those fucks
didn't show?

22:45.047 --> 22:47.673
It's a fabulous turnout.
I was worried that people
wouldn't show,

22:47.756 --> 22:49.839
and it seems that
absolutely everybody
is here,

22:49.923 --> 22:51.547
so we can relax.

22:52.589 --> 22:53.839
There she is.

22:53.923 --> 22:55.923
Jolene:
Ugh. Our lactator-in-chief.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.005
Grace:
She looks a bit uncomfortable.

22:58.089 --> 23:00.214
That's the mom
I was telling you about.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.172
-Oh, that's her?
-Mm-hmm.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.047
-The nudist?
-I want those boobs.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.756
Amanda:
You know, we should
go talk to her.

23:05.839 --> 23:07.798
She must be feeling
so awkward.

23:07.881 --> 23:10.381
Sally:
Actually, she seems okay.

23:10.464 --> 23:13.130
Mm, maybe better than okay.

23:13.214 --> 23:15.839
-Jonathan:
Am I missing something?
-Amanda: Look at the men.

23:15.923 --> 23:17.381
Sally:
Like Pavlov's dogs.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.673
Grace, I, I think
she might be
looking at you.

23:20.756 --> 23:22.798
Really? Is she?

23:23.631 --> 23:25.964
Jonathan:
Uh, yeah. I think she is.

23:26.047 --> 23:27.422
Sylvia:
Well, here you all are.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.464
I think they'd like
to get started.
It's bidding time.

23:29.547 --> 23:31.923
-Start herding the people.
-Diane: All right. Here we go.

23:32.005 --> 23:33.381
Come on.

23:33.464 --> 23:35.547
Is that enough?
We've put in
an appearance.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.172
-Can we go?
-Would you stop?

23:37.255 --> 23:40.130
Hey. I'll make it
up to you later.

23:40.214 --> 23:43.756
Make it up to me now.
Let's find a room.
They must have a few.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.714
-You're so bad.
-Come on.
In Suki's closet.

23:46.798 --> 23:49.339
-In Suki's clothes.
Both of us.
-Stop!

23:49.422 --> 23:50.964
Make an Englishman happy.
Come on.

23:51.047 --> 23:52.923
(Grace laughs)

23:53.005 --> 23:55.130
-Aah.
-(glass clicks on table)

23:55.214 --> 23:56.839
-You know what
I love about this?
-What?

23:56.923 --> 23:58.172
You could never tell
they were rich.

23:58.255 --> 24:00.673
It's all so classy
and understated.

24:01.631 --> 24:03.172
Sally:
Hi. We're ready to start.

24:03.255 --> 24:04.589
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

24:04.673 --> 24:07.547
I'm Sally Maybury,
head of the auction
committee,

24:07.631 --> 24:11.589
-for our wonderful
Reardon School!
-(all applauding)

24:11.673 --> 24:13.089
-Woo!
-(cheering)

24:13.172 --> 24:15.547
Sally:
We have a positively fabulous

24:15.631 --> 24:17.130
afternoon in store for you.

24:17.214 --> 24:19.923
Now, some of you
might be thinking,

24:20.005 --> 24:22.547
"Don't I already pay enough
in tuition?"

24:22.631 --> 24:24.506
-Woman: Damn right!
-(laughter)

24:24.589 --> 24:28.381
Yes. Of course you do.
Yes, I feel the same way.

24:28.464 --> 24:30.631
But, it is our responsibility

24:30.714 --> 24:32.798
to make sure that
Reardon can accept

24:32.881 --> 24:34.631
the students it wants to accept,

24:34.714 --> 24:37.089
and that those students
are able to attend,

24:37.172 --> 24:38.964
despite their financial
circumstances,

24:39.047 --> 24:43.130
ensuring that the name Reardon
is always synonymous with...

24:43.214 --> 24:46.172
-Diversity!
-(applauding)

24:47.881 --> 24:49.547
Sally:
And of course,
we have to make sure that

24:49.631 --> 24:51.089
our teachers are so well paid

24:51.172 --> 24:53.255
that we do not lose them
to other schools.

24:53.339 --> 24:55.964
-We love our teachers
at Reardon! Woo!
-(applauding)

24:56.047 --> 24:58.297
Just not enough to
invite them to the party.

24:58.381 --> 25:00.005
-Shush.
-Sally: Okay, now,

25:00.089 --> 25:03.381
Diane Porter is gonna
start the party. Let's go!

25:03.464 --> 25:05.798
-Woo!
-(all applauding)

25:05.881 --> 25:09.255
Diane:
Before we turn to
our scheduled items for bid...

25:10.506 --> 25:11.881
Observe.

25:11.964 --> 25:15.339
This may look like
an ordinary glass
of tap water,

25:15.422 --> 25:17.214
but it is much
more than that.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.923
This is very special water

25:21.005 --> 25:24.089
that will serve to
prime the pipes

25:24.172 --> 25:26.589
to your generously
deep pockets.

25:26.673 --> 25:28.214
-All: Aw...
-(laughter)

25:28.297 --> 25:30.422
Diane:
What is the value,
you may ask,

25:30.506 --> 25:32.422
of an ordinary glass
of tap water?

25:32.506 --> 25:33.673
That depends.

25:33.756 --> 25:37.798
What is the value of
your children's education?

25:37.881 --> 25:40.172
The value of his
or her teachers?

25:40.255 --> 25:42.923
The opportunity
of the less fortunate

25:43.005 --> 25:46.506
to enjoy the privilege
of your offspring.

25:46.589 --> 25:51.714
Who will bid $1,000

25:51.798 --> 25:54.214
for this glass of water?

25:54.297 --> 25:57.547
Who is gonna stand up
and clang that bell?

25:57.631 --> 26:00.464
-Woman: 1,000!
-Diane: $1,000!

26:00.547 --> 26:03.881
-Thank you. Money for our kids.
-(applauding)

26:03.964 --> 26:06.047
-Man: 2,000!
-Diane: 2,000!

26:06.130 --> 26:08.673
3,000...

26:08.756 --> 26:10.422
5,000 right here...

26:10.506 --> 26:12.714
-Man: Eight!
-Diane: 8,000, right here!

26:12.798 --> 26:15.756
-Man: I bid 10!
-Diane: 10,000!

26:15.839 --> 26:18.464
(applauding)

26:22.130 --> 26:25.089
-(toilet flushing)
-Grace: Oh, uh...

26:25.172 --> 26:26.506
Elena. Sorry--

26:26.589 --> 26:29.631
-I...
-(whispers): Sorry.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.464
-(exhales)
-Grace: Are you okay?

26:35.673 --> 26:37.673
(exhales)

26:38.172 --> 26:39.506
(sighs)

26:42.464 --> 26:43.839
(blows nose)

26:44.422 --> 26:46.005
(groans)

26:48.506 --> 26:50.464
I'm sorry.

26:50.547 --> 26:51.923
(sniffles)

26:52.005 --> 26:55.506
(exhales)
'Cause sometimes
I just feel...

26:55.589 --> 26:57.172
overwhelmed.

26:59.714 --> 27:01.339
And lost.

27:02.172 --> 27:04.005
-Grace: Mm.
-I...

27:07.047 --> 27:09.005
Do you ever feel that?

27:10.297 --> 27:12.506
If you ever want to talk...

27:14.047 --> 27:16.214
For free, uh...

27:18.005 --> 27:20.798
I apologize.
I didn't mean it
to sound like that.

27:20.881 --> 27:23.589
But if you do ever
wanna talk...

27:26.339 --> 27:28.714
You're so kind.
Thank you.

27:29.589 --> 27:31.589
And please,
don't be intimidated.

27:31.673 --> 27:34.589
The parents at Reardon
can be a little, um...

27:35.631 --> 27:37.547
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.381
But...

27:40.381 --> 27:43.130
Most of them are very kind.
They're...

27:43.214 --> 27:46.673
They are nice people.
Kind people and...

27:46.756 --> 27:49.089
But you are the most kind.

27:50.547 --> 27:52.005
It's true.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.881
I feel it.

28:03.756 --> 28:05.422
Diane:
All right, our next item...

28:05.506 --> 28:07.506
-Knicks tickets. Wow.
-(excited chatter)

28:07.589 --> 28:09.964
You can rub elbows
with Spike Lee.

28:10.047 --> 28:11.881
Pitch him your idea
for a new movie.

28:11.964 --> 28:14.506
Hey, you never know.
They might even win the game.

28:14.589 --> 28:15.881
(all exclaiming)

28:15.964 --> 28:18.172
All right. Who's gonna
take these tickets
off my hands?

28:18.255 --> 28:20.798
Let's start the bidding
at 1,500.

28:20.881 --> 28:22.964
-Thank you.
-Diane: 1,500, right here.

28:23.047 --> 28:26.255
2,000, in the front. 2,500.
Do I hear 3,000?

28:26.339 --> 28:28.506
-Diane: 3,000 over here. 35?
-Man: Yeah.

28:28.589 --> 28:30.839
-Diane: 4,000, near the piano.
-Man: Right here.

28:30.923 --> 28:32.964
Diane:
$6,000!

28:33.047 --> 28:35.798
-Going once, going twice...
-Elena?

28:35.881 --> 28:38.547
-Diane: Yours, for--
-Oh, hi.

28:38.631 --> 28:41.381
I'm going home
'cause I forgot to pump,

28:41.464 --> 28:43.172
and it's getting a bit
uncomfortable.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.172
Oh. I have a car.

28:45.255 --> 28:47.381
My driver could take you,
if you want.

28:47.464 --> 28:50.422
-Oh. Oh, no, I'm...
-Please.

28:50.506 --> 28:51.964
I'm in Harlem,

28:52.047 --> 28:54.881
so, it'll be faster
to take the subway.

28:54.964 --> 28:58.005
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm sure.

28:58.798 --> 29:00.339
But thank you.

29:02.964 --> 29:06.297
Oh, hey. It's all right.

29:12.714 --> 29:14.547
Thank you.

29:14.631 --> 29:16.339
For your kindness.

29:26.005 --> 29:27.339
(door closes)

29:32.964 --> 29:34.756
Diane:
Do I hear 80? 80,000?

29:34.839 --> 29:38.089
Gentleman in the front.
90? 90,000.

29:38.172 --> 29:39.422
If we reach 100,000,

29:39.506 --> 29:42.089
we'll donate a C-class
to a child in need.

29:42.172 --> 29:44.547
(crowd laughing)

29:45.130 --> 29:46.089
So what was all that?

29:46.172 --> 29:48.422
What's going on with you
and the nudist?

29:48.506 --> 29:50.547
(exhales) She was upset,

29:50.631 --> 29:53.464
and she just, um,

29:53.547 --> 29:57.297
I suggested she use our car
but she didn't want to, so...

29:57.381 --> 29:59.130
You are a very nice person.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.547
-(chuckles)
-Come here.

30:00.631 --> 30:03.005
-(applause)
-(laughs)

30:03.089 --> 30:04.756
I love you.

30:04.839 --> 30:07.172
-I love you.
-Diane: Thank you so much.
It's been an incredible evening.

30:07.255 --> 30:10.339
You raised so much
money for a good cause.
Thank you.

30:10.422 --> 30:13.089
-(piano music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

30:17.214 --> 30:18.881
Grace:
We're good?

30:19.714 --> 30:21.964
Sylvia:
Joanna...

30:22.047 --> 30:24.798
-Well, you're not gonna
be happy.
-Why?

30:24.881 --> 30:27.047
-I just got paged.
-Mm-hmm?

30:27.130 --> 30:30.506
Shelby McGibbons' lungs
just filled up with fluid.

30:30.589 --> 30:32.422
-Go.
-You want to come?

30:32.506 --> 30:34.047
Legitimate excuse
to duck out early.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.631
The driver could drop me
at the hospital?

30:35.714 --> 30:37.964
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the committee. Go.

30:38.047 --> 30:39.839
-Go, go. Take the driver.
I'll Uber.
-Really? I'm sorry.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.923
I'm sorry.
I'll, I'll call.

30:43.172 --> 30:44.422
(laughs)

30:45.297 --> 30:47.255
-Mm.
-Sally: Where's he going?

30:47.339 --> 30:49.839
Emergency.
One of his patients.

30:49.923 --> 30:53.172
Honestly, staring down cancer
every day with children,

30:53.255 --> 30:55.047
maintaining a sense
of humor all the while.

30:55.130 --> 30:58.255
-How does he do it?
-Grace: I wonder myself.

31:00.047 --> 31:02.881
-(piano music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

31:14.297 --> 31:16.756
(distant siren blaring)

31:35.714 --> 31:38.089
(slow breathing)

31:42.964 --> 31:44.714
Shelby:
TEN DOLLARS.

31:44.798 --> 31:46.756
Jonathan:
YEP. YOU HAVE MY SOLEMN WORD.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.381
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I'M A DOCTOR.

31:48.464 --> 31:51.506
Shelby:
TEN BUCKS IF I BEAT LEUKEMIA.

31:51.589 --> 31:52.756
Yeah.

31:52.839 --> 31:54.214
I mean, if you prefer,

31:54.297 --> 31:57.005
I could give you
a whole talk about, um,

31:57.089 --> 31:59.881
you know,
being brave and fighting,

31:59.964 --> 32:02.547
and all that sort of stuff
but I do find,
generally speaking,

32:02.631 --> 32:04.422
money works best.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.756
Shelby:
How 'bout $10,

32:06.839 --> 32:09.464
and when I apply
to medical school,

32:09.547 --> 32:12.255
you write my recommendation.

32:12.339 --> 32:14.172
I don't know.
I don't know, Shelby.

32:14.255 --> 32:15.756
I'd have to see
your transcripts,

32:15.839 --> 32:18.673
because I can't recommend
just anyone.

32:18.756 --> 32:20.339
You could be awful.

32:21.798 --> 32:23.839
Am I going to die?

32:26.381 --> 32:27.964
You're not gonna die.

I don't think Dad
is actually allergic
to dogs.

36:00.047 --> 36:01.881
I think he just says it.

36:03.881 --> 36:05.881
Yeah. You're right.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.047
It's not about being allergic.

36:08.130 --> 36:11.589
He would never want me
to tell you this, so don't
say anything, all right?

36:11.673 --> 36:13.297
Okay.

36:13.381 --> 36:16.089
But when he was younger,
he was actually your age,

36:16.172 --> 36:19.506
he was home alone,
he was taking care of
the family dog,

36:19.589 --> 36:21.506
it got out of the house...

36:21.589 --> 36:24.255
and it was hit by a car
and killed.

36:25.839 --> 36:28.714
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

36:28.798 --> 36:31.297
I mean, it was very
traumatic for him.

36:31.381 --> 36:35.047
And it was actually made worse
because his parents...

36:36.589 --> 36:37.839
blamed him for it.

36:37.923 --> 36:41.547
-What?
-Yeah. That's why
he hates talking about it.

36:43.631 --> 36:45.297
What kind of dog?

36:45.381 --> 36:47.964
Um... (scoffs)
What kind of--

36:48.047 --> 36:51.339
I think it was...
It was a small dog.

36:51.422 --> 36:52.589
That's what I know.

would you? Let's go.

It's freezing outside.
-All right.

Grace:
AT SOME POINT, YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

37:09.214 --> 37:10.673
The why of it all.

37:10.756 --> 37:13.047
It had nothing to do
with us. Or you.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.631
-Bullshit!
-Here we go.

37:14.714 --> 37:16.297
So, what was it about, then?

37:16.381 --> 37:17.297
Just sex?

37:17.381 --> 37:19.130
If I had a clue,
I wouldn't be here

37:19.214 --> 37:20.673
paying these
criminally high rates.

37:20.756 --> 37:22.756
-We are paying these
criminally high rates.
-Would I?

Grace:
That's just a bit deflective,
isn't it, Joseph?

37:24.964 --> 37:28.714
Is it possible that you were
drawn to the secret of it all?

37:28.798 --> 37:31.631
Maybe more than you were
to this other man, Dennis?

37:31.714 --> 37:33.673
The affair got to be
yours alone?

37:33.756 --> 37:37.297
Michael couldn't know about it,
so he couldn't micromanage it?

37:38.839 --> 37:40.297
I don't think that's it.

37:42.881 --> 37:44.506

you from something?

I apologize.
This is my son's school.

37:51.714 --> 37:55.172
It is programmed for
emergencies only,
so I do have to take it.

38:00.005 --> 38:02.089
(phone thuds)

38:02.172 --> 38:04.589
Now, you said that you knew
Dennis when you were single,

38:04.673 --> 38:06.047
but you never had sex
with him then.

38:06.130 --> 38:07.673
I wasn't even
attracted to him then.

38:07.756 --> 38:09.255
No one was attracted to him.
He's not attractive.

38:09.339 --> 38:11.422
-Okay...
-Grace: Exactly.
Then what changed?

38:11.506 --> 38:14.381
Part of the thrill
of adultery is that

38:14.464 --> 38:17.130
it exists in the shadow

38:17.214 --> 38:18.839
of a primary relationship.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.506
It's the clandestine part of it

38:20.589 --> 38:22.130
that provides
much of the erotic jolt.

38:22.214 --> 38:23.547
Could that have
been it here?

38:24.297 --> 38:25.673
The lie?

38:28.214 --> 38:30.714
What about the fear
of getting caught?

38:32.297 --> 38:34.297
Maybe you wanted to get caught.

38:34.381 --> 38:35.964
Why would I want that?

38:36.047 --> 38:38.756
To show Michael that
he can't control you, after all?

38:40.839 --> 38:43.631
I think this is more about
Michael and your marriage

38:43.714 --> 38:46.756
-than it is about
this other man.
-(door opens)

38:46.839 --> 38:48.255

other people are right.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.589

She wasn't, um,
a patient of mine,
Mrs. Alves.

44:19.589 --> 44:23.130
She was a--
She-- I mean,
I wasn't treating her.

44:23.214 --> 44:24.714
How well did you know her?

44:24.798 --> 44:29.255
Uh, not well.
As I said, she'd only
just joined the committee.

44:29.339 --> 44:30.798
And you saw her last when?

44:30.881 --> 44:33.798
Grace:
I saw her last night
at the benefit.

44:33.881 --> 44:36.339
Mendoza:
And you didn't talk to her
after that?

44:36.422 --> 44:38.673
-No.
-Mendoza:
Did you notice anyone

44:38.756 --> 44:42.089
Mrs. Alves might have spoken to?

44:44.589 --> 44:48.214
I mean, there were just
some men who were
paying her

44:48.297 --> 44:50.130
special attention.

44:50.214 --> 44:52.214
-What do you mean,
special attention?
-No, I mean,

44:52.297 --> 44:55.422
the, the special attention
that men sometimes

44:55.506 --> 44:57.381
-pay to a woman.
-Mendoza: Mm.

44:58.255 --> 45:00.839
And what about
Mrs. Alves' husband?

45:00.923 --> 45:02.381
Was he there last night?

45:03.214 --> 45:05.339
Not to my knowledge.

45:05.422 --> 45:07.881
I mean, I never met him, so...

45:12.172 --> 45:14.381
Do you suspect
the husband of this?

45:14.464 --> 45:17.381
Right now, we're just,
uh, gathering facts.

45:17.464 --> 45:21.422
Would it be possible for us
to speak to your husband?

45:21.506 --> 45:25.130
Um, well, um, why?

45:25.214 --> 45:27.255
Well, he might have
seen something.

45:27.339 --> 45:30.381
Oh. No. No, he didn't.

45:30.464 --> 45:33.464
So you've spoken to him
since this news came to light?

45:33.547 --> 45:35.589
No, but anything that
he would have seen,

45:35.673 --> 45:37.506
-I would have seen, so...
-Where's your husband now?

45:37.589 --> 45:38.923
He's in Cleveland.

45:39.005 --> 45:41.172
He's at an oncology
convention.

45:41.255 --> 45:42.506
Mendoza:
Where's he staying?

45:42.589 --> 45:43.547
Grace:
I think at a Hyatt,

45:43.631 --> 45:45.172
-or something.
-When did he go there?

45:45.255 --> 45:46.881
Uh, this morning.

45:46.964 --> 45:48.714
-Early.

45:56.255 --> 45:57.714
Grace:
Um, I'm just talking
to these men.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.255
Could you go to your room,
and I'll, um,

45:59.339 --> 46:00.756
I'll be up in a minute?

46:00.839 --> 46:03.339
-I'll make you a snack.
-Is everything okay?

46:03.422 --> 46:05.297
Grace:
Yes. Yep. Everything's fine.

46:05.381 --> 46:07.756
I just need you
to go upstairs,

46:07.839 --> 46:10.339
and, um, I'll be right there.

46:11.339 --> 46:13.255
Off you go.
I'll be right there.

46:13.339 --> 46:15.005
-Okay.
-Grace: Good.

46:17.673 --> 46:19.214
Go on. (laughs)

46:21.339 --> 46:23.381
Did your son know
the Alves boy?

46:23.464 --> 46:25.923
Um, no. No.

46:26.005 --> 46:29.130
I mean, they're...
They're in different grades.

46:29.214 --> 46:31.422
Yeah, but it's kind of
a small school, isn't it?

46:31.506 --> 46:34.422
That's what I read
on the website.
Small school,

46:34.506 --> 46:36.756
individual attention.

46:36.839 --> 46:39.172
That's why it costs
the big bucks, right?

46:42.714 --> 46:45.089
What is the tuition there?

46:45.172 --> 46:46.839
How much do you pay?

46:46.923 --> 46:50.464
Um, it's...

46:50.547 --> 46:52.673
-$50,000 a year.
-Oof.

46:52.756 --> 46:56.130
Fifty grand. How do you think
they could afford that?
The Alveses?

46:56.214 --> 46:59.589
I mean, I think
it was a scholarship.

46:59.673 --> 47:03.631
But, I don't really have
any knowledge of, uh,

47:03.714 --> 47:06.839
the Alves' financial
circumstances.

47:08.798 --> 47:10.714
Are we upsetting you,
doctor?

47:12.923 --> 47:17.214
(sighs) If there's anything,
anything else I can do.

47:17.714 --> 47:19.005

-The police.

-Henry...
-Are they here
for the murder?

47:43.255 --> 47:46.255
-Yeah.
-Oh, I saw it on my phone.

47:46.339 --> 47:48.422
-Really?
-Yeah.

47:51.964 --> 47:53.798
They mentioned Reardon.

47:54.923 --> 47:58.381
Oh. Did you, um...
Did you know the boy?

47:58.464 --> 48:00.214

48:01.964 --> 48:03.964
I don't think so.

48:06.381 --> 48:08.714
-Thank you.

48:29.130 --> 48:30.589
Did you know her?

She was on
the auction committee.
