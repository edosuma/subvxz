00:01.500 --> 00:03.420
Boom.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.830
I'm very fascinated by
the fact you haven't
shown much interest

00:05.830 --> 00:07.670

Mr. Mike McQuigg.

00:07.670 --> 00:08.830

00:08.830 --> 00:11.080
No.
Studying.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.170
No one here
pities you.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.330
I'm your friend.
Count on that.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.330
Celine: Owen.
He's into you.

00:17.330 --> 00:19.500
Harry:
This might be the first time
you've had a friend die --

00:19.500 --> 00:21.000
She didn't die,
she was killed.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.330
Don't any of you ever stop
to wonder who you are anymore?

00:24.330 --> 00:25.830
Resignation accepted.

00:25.830 --> 00:27.460
I saw the pregnancy test
in your bag.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.210
You must have opened up
someone else's bag.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.750
It's probably nothing,
false alarm.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.380
But if you were sure, you
wouldn't have bought the test.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.120
And now you're scared
to take it.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.620
Alex: I thought I had
it all figured out.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.330
Or at least,
I was figuring it out.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.620
And then, wham.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.330
Life throws you a curveball.

01:03.670 --> 01:06.500
Now I'm questioning everything.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.920
Things that I thought
were my strengths...

01:09.920 --> 01:12.580
maybe they're my weaknesses.

01:12.580 --> 01:16.920
The things that I thought
were most important,

01:16.920 --> 01:19.920
maybe they're just not.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.460
Even my job at the FBI, I...

01:23.920 --> 01:28.380
A job I loved so much,
it just makes me --

01:28.380 --> 01:30.170
makes me feel empty.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.000
It's worse than empty.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.170
It's like it's
chipping away at my soul.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.250
And I just don't think my soul
is worth $65K a year.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.750
I know something has to change.

01:51.290 --> 01:54.380
I just don't know what it is

01:54.380 --> 01:56.120
or how to change it.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.880
Thank you
for sharing, Alex.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.210
Man: Thanks for sharing.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.790
Hey.

02:13.790 --> 02:15.670
Took me two months
to work up the nerve

02:15.670 --> 02:17.670
to share like that
in here.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.080
I hope it's as discreet
as they say.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.750
That's why the group
was created.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.750

security clearance?

02:24.750 --> 02:26.380
It's AA for spies.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.000
Discretion is essential.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000

reveal any nuclear codes?

02:33.670 --> 02:35.420
Give me a pen,
and I'll write them down.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.380
I know.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.580
I'll get used to it.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.670

your life isn't your own

02:53.330 --> 02:55.080

to change it.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.250

to asking for a sponsor?

03:01.250 --> 03:02.920
No, I think I'm good.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.120
Thanks, though.
I just --

03:04.120 --> 03:06.620
No, please, I'm not saying
it needs to be me.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.960
But this process...

03:08.960 --> 03:11.580
you can't do it alone.

03:11.580 --> 03:14.880
Do you have anyone you can
call when things get bad?

03:18.080 --> 03:20.210
Yeah.

03:20.210 --> 03:22.620
Then, let me
help you, Alex.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.580
Hey.

03:27.580 --> 03:29.750
Call me, day or night.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.670

03:31.670 --> 03:33.790
You may regret it, but I'm gonna
take you up on that offer.

03:33.790 --> 03:35.000
Thanks, David.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.080
All right, Alex.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.580

is your new best friend.

03:48.170 --> 03:49.540
Oh, I prefer my old one.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.120
Who are you
calling old?

03:52.880 --> 03:56.290
Three weeks ago, we tasked
an elite unit with infiltrating

03:56.290 --> 03:59.500
First Pledge International,
a key contractor to the U.S.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.080
in Afghanistan during
Operation Enduring Freedom,

04:02.080 --> 04:04.790
who we now believe to be
colluding with some of

04:04.790 --> 04:06.670
America's greatest enemies.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.830
I am now going to turn
the floor over to Owen Hall,

04:08.830 --> 04:10.620
who heads up the unit
who will cut the head off

04:10.620 --> 04:12.080
this snake
once and for all.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.000
Good afternoon.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.750
Senator, we do not accept
that U.S. law can be enforced

04:16.750 --> 04:18.459
on foreign soil.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.380
My men are not regular military
and are therefore immune to --

04:22.710 --> 04:25.380
After a series of scandals,
Garrett King,

04:25.380 --> 04:26.960
the founder of
First Pledge International,

04:26.960 --> 04:30.580
has found himself and his
company persona non grata

04:30.580 --> 04:32.120
to the Pentagon.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.710
That hasn't stopped him, though.

04:33.710 --> 04:36.620
He's continued to recruit
soldiers and various agents

04:36.620 --> 04:38.960
from the intelligence community
into his small army

04:38.960 --> 04:44.080
and has now become a clear
and present danger to the U.S.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
Now, King is careful,
slippery, and has, heretofore,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.620
managed to shield himself
from any and all prosecution.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.040
This is David Quintana,
a little-known researcher

04:55.040 --> 04:56.830
for the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.960
who we believe to be one of
King's top recruiters

04:58.960 --> 05:00.420
and a trusted lieutenant.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.830
Now, one of my agents
has managed to get

05:02.830 --> 05:04.670
close to Quintana and is in
the process of being recruited

05:04.670 --> 05:05.750
into First Pledge.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.540
General Sharpe:
In the process?

05:07.540 --> 05:11.210
Mr. Hall, DIA is saying
that two North Korean generals

05:11.210 --> 05:13.120
slipped into Newark
last night,

05:13.120 --> 05:14.920

with King.
