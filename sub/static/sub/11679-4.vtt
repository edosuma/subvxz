Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.869 --> 00:05.531
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.110
Miam i.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.549
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.623 --> 00:26.490
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392
an old friend who used to
inform on you to the F.B.I.--

00:29.462 --> 00:31.760
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.163
- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.234 --> 00:36.395
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.937
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:40.974 --> 00:42.965
you're not going anywhere.

[ Michael Narrating] Getyour hands on
any classified document worth having...

00:54.154 --> 00:56.315
chances are it's going to be redacted...

00:56.389 --> 00:59.688
which makes reading it a lot like
watching a movie on an airplane.

00:59.759 --> 01:03.092
All the juicy parts are missing,
but you still get the basic idea.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.096
Anythi ng good?

01:05.165 --> 01:07.861
Hard to tel I when you only get
every thi rd word.

01:07.934 --> 01:11.665
Well, are you surprised? These are
the people who burned you, Michael.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.333
You're lucky ifyou get any information
about their operatives.

01:15.408 --> 01:19.310
Looks like Carla's cover in Kurdistan
was an irrigation consultant.

01:19.379 --> 01:24.180
Hmm. Maybe she could set something up
to water the ferns in my apartment...

01:24.250 --> 01:27.947
when she's not threatening your family
or forcing you to run black ops.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.955
I'll be sure to ask her.

01:30.023 --> 01:33.550
Cheer up. It's a start, isn't it?

01:33.626 --> 01:36.322
Yeah.
And there's a decent chance...

01:36.396 --> 01:38.626
she's using a similar cover here in Miami.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.792
[Michael Narrating]
Jobs in agriculture are a convenient cover.

01:41.868 --> 01:44.928
Makes it easyto explainyourpresence
in the field and the boardroom.

01:45.004 --> 01:49.236
The only downside is, you might have to
become an expert on chickpeas.

01:49.309 --> 01:53.006
Why don't you put that away?
Give it a couple hours.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.013
You, um--

01:55.081 --> 01:57.515
You might see something that you missed.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.018
Like a tail.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.316
Lincoln Town Car, up the street.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.823
I saw them before we left... my place.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.687
- Doyou think it's them?
- Could be.

02:10.763 --> 02:14.665
It's gonna be a very. interesting conversation
ifthey catch you with that file.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.565
Can I watch?

02:18.404 --> 02:20.668
You drive.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.102
[ Tires Squealing ]

02:27.180 --> 02:31.947
[Michael Narrating] You can tell a lot about
who's followingyou bythe maneuvers they use.

02:32.018 --> 02:35.579
Quick, evasive driving,
a casual bailout, feigning car trouble--

02:35.655 --> 02:38.783
these are signs you're dealing
with a professional.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.851
Smashing into a rickshaw
like a crash test dummy--

02:42.929 --> 02:46.695
that's a sign you're dealing with an amateur,
somebody who doesn 't know what he 's doing.

02:46.766 --> 02:50.793
- Easy, easy, Bro! Come on. I t's a rental, man.
- [ Bell Dinging]

02:53.106 --> 02:56.303
[ Michael Narrating]
That's when you've really got a problem.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.107
- [ Nate ] You sure it's safe here?
- As safe as it can be.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.381
- You wanna tell me what you were doing, Nate?
- Well, I was following you.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.648
I was making sure you weren't followed.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.952
Don't look at me like I'm crazy, all right?

03:12.025 --> 03:15.984
The last time I saw you, you were
being chased by guys with guns.

03:16.062 --> 03:20.761
Bythe way, I nevergot so much as a phone call
fromyou to let me know that things were cool.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.767
- And I guess you called Mom.
- Mom called me.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.565
Ijust figuredyou wouldn't leave me
twisting in the wind in Fort Lauderdale...

03:25.638 --> 03:27.572
after I risked my ass for you.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.770
It was just a little unclear at the time...
whether I should call you.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.778
I'm not here to talk about that.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.939
- Look, I got a friend at workwho's in trouble.
- Work?

03:36.015 --> 03:38.483
Yeah, I got a job driving
for a limo company.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.179
A real job? An actual job?

03:41.254 --> 03:45.156
I'm friends with the receptionist.
She's in trouble with some Russian Mafia guys.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.092
They're holding hersister.
I was hopingyou could help out.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.186
What's the angle?

03:52.232 --> 03:55.668
- There's gotta be an angle?
- There's always an angle, Nate.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.295
Are you trying to get money from her,
trying to sleep with her?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.635
Maybe I'm just changing my life.
Did you think ofthat?

04:01.941 --> 04:03.875
You blew up my truck, right?

04:03.943 --> 04:06.878
You got me shot at.
You had me hide Mom.

04:06.946 --> 04:10.939
That's the kind ofthing that gets a guy
to step back and make a few changes.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.642
And by the way,
I'm still paying offthat truck.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.620
- It's like 600 a month.
- 200.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.519
Well, 300, butyou see what I'm saying.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.321
Look, would you just talk to her?

04:23.229 --> 04:25.220
Fine.
[ Sighs ]

04:25.298 --> 04:27.289
- Where is she?
- Mom's house.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.575
- I don't need tea, Mom.
- It's good. It's herbal.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.579
So,you're gonna help, right, Michael?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.979
That's what I'm here to find out.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.813
- Excuse me.
- Uh, Ma?

04:46.986 --> 04:49.250
Could you?

04:49.322 --> 04:51.882
- Ma.
- Oh.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.054
Yeah, I'll leave the three ofyou
to talk... alone...

04:56.129 --> 04:58.723
without me.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.858
It's all right.
Tell him,just likeyou told me.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.164
[ Russian Accent]
My sister, Elena.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.434
I've triedto bringhertoAmerica
foryears.

05:07.507 --> 05:11.409
One dayshe writes to me,
says she foundsomeone to take herhere.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.037
I knew something is wrong.
Is too good to be true.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.674
She doesn't thi nk.
She gives me a name, and I go.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.275
I t's this patsan Ivan,
a gangster.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.117
He brings people here for money.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.158
First he wants $25,000-- all I have.

05:26.225 --> 05:30.594
I go to pick her up this week,
and now he wants $50,000 more--

05:30.663 --> 05:33.723
Oryou'll never see your sister again.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.793
And ifyou go to the police, he'll kill her.
That's usually how this kind ofthing works.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.196
How'd you get this? Did he hityou?

05:41.274 --> 05:44.732
Yes, after I attack him
with the-- the bar.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.541
You know, the metal bar
for taking out the nails?

05:47.613 --> 05:49.478
- You hit him with a crowbar?
- Yes.

05:49.549 --> 05:53.007
He's lucky. His ohraniki
take me away from him, hold me away.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.577
Iftheywere not there,
I'd bite his finger off.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.452
Katya asked me to help her get a gun.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.460
Afterl heard
what herproblem was...

06:02.528 --> 06:05.429
I figured the best thing for her
and her sisterwould be talking to you.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.558
Nate says you could help.
He says you do these things every day.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.228
I don't do them every day...

06:11.304 --> 06:13.295
but I'll see what I can do.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.841
- Hereyou go.
- Thanks.Just put that on my friend's tab.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.853
Sure.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.913
A crowbar? That sounds like a handful.
[ Laughs ]

06:31.991 --> 06:35.017
Come to think ofit,
I dated a few Ukrainians in my day.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.085
- Feisty.
- Fi's doing the surveillance.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.825
Hopefully, we'll track the guy
back to where the girls are...

06:39.899 --> 06:42.459
before Katya gets her hands
on a blowtorch.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.665
- [ Grunts ]
- How's it going with the file on Carla?

06:46.739 --> 06:50.038
Pretty good. Talked to a guy
named Harvey Gunderson.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.010
He's the secretary.treasurer ofthe
AgriculturalAssociation ofSouth Florida...

06:53.079 --> 06:55.013
among other things.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.209
So if Carla is still using
agricultural specialist as a cover...

06:58.284 --> 07:00.844
chances are prettygood
that he's heard ofher.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.854
Nice work, Sam.
Just keep it quiet, all right?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.856
Can't have this getting back to Carla.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.688
Quiet's my specialty, Mike.
Hey, what's your budget on this?

07:07.760 --> 07:10.695
You know, I'm thinking it should be
face-to-face with Harvey, you know...

07:10.763 --> 07:13.061
so I can thoroughly debriefhim.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.033
- I'll cover it, Sam.
- I'll try and keep it reasonable.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.334
- Who is she?
- [Engine Shuts Off]

07:23.409 --> 07:26.105
Someone I workwith.
She's gonna tail Ivan.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.306
Hopefully, he'll lead us
to whereyour sister is.

07:28.381 --> 07:31.714
He's there. Uh, that is his van.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.775
- [Nate ] Wow.
- [ShutterClicks ]

07:36.422 --> 07:39.050
Guy's got interesting tattoos.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.923
Russian prison ink.
Each one means something.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.063
Really?

07:45.131 --> 07:48.225
- What's the spade for?
- It means he's a thief.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.531
- Tiger means enforcer.
- Yeah?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.065
Huh.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.535
What about the skulls?
What are those for?

07:58.744 --> 08:00.712
Mike, what do the skulls mean?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.408
- It means murderer, Nate.
- Murderer?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.077
He has mysister!
Whywejustsit here?

08:07.386 --> 08:09.354
I won't let anything happen.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.947
I promise.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.803
[Michael Narrating]
Cultivating intelligence assets...

08:26.873 --> 08:29.307
usually requires
some wining and dining.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.610
The more connected somebody is...

08:34.679 --> 08:37.274
the more they know...

08:37.350 --> 08:40.910
the more they feel entitled
to a little special treatment.

08:40.986 --> 08:44.150
- Another cocktai l?
- Thi nk we're ready for a bottle
of something, don't you?

08:44.222 --> 08:46.282
Uh, I'm still workin' on the scotch,
thankyou.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.554
Okay. A bottle of scotch.
I'm kidding.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.893
- '96, uh, Château Lafite.
- Excellent choice.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.626
I know it's an excellent choice.
I made it.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.691
I'll pick 'em, you bring 'em!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.768
Mmm! It's a hell of a wine.
You're gonna love it.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.140
So anyway, you're thinking
of growing hops in Turkey, is it?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.645
Yeah. Outside Ankara.
Hey, um--

09:07.713 --> 09:10.876
So, Harvey, wereyou able to put together
that list ofirrigation specialists?

09:10.950 --> 09:13.783
You know, I need to make a few calls
and work some things out.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.754
I was thinking. You don't wanna
waste time going through a bunch of names.

09:16.822 --> 09:20.121
I can pointyou to some top-flight people,
butyou knowwhat?

09:20.192 --> 09:22.183
Maybeyou and I can
take 'em to dinner together.

09:22.261 --> 09:25.059
- Soyou can get to know 'em, that's all.
- Oh! Oh, great idea.

09:25.131 --> 09:28.066
Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, you know,
I really need that list, Harvey...

09:28.134 --> 09:30.830
just to make sure
I got all the bases covered.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.064
[Michael Narrating]Smart operatives
know how to steerthe conversation...

09:33.139 --> 09:35.107
towards the information they need.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.199
- You know what you really need, Sam?
- Hmm?

09:37.276 --> 09:39.005
[ Michael Narrating]
Clever assets, on the other hand...

09:39.078 --> 09:43.572
know how to make the wine-and-dine phase
last as long as possible.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.640
- The lobster.
- [ Chuckl i ng ]

09:45.718 --> 09:47.709
- I 'm serious. You ever had the lobster here?
- No, no.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.812
- Swimming off the coast of Maine four hours ago.
- No kidding.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.381
Which reminds me--We should get a bottle
ofwhite ifwe're gonna have the seafood.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.951
Montrachet, grand cru.
Unbelievable.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.020
It's liquid gold.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.332
- $600?
- What can I say, Mike?

10:05.404 --> 10:07.497
The guy ate like it was his last meal.

10:07.573 --> 10:11.373
And the liquor-- I mean, I've had gunshot
wounds hurt less than this hangover.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.845
You got, like, a bag offrozen peas
or something cold for my head?

10:14.914 --> 10:18.008
Did you get the list?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.983
600 bucks, and no names?

10:21.053 --> 10:23.521
Look, he's just trying
to drag it out, okay?

10:23.589 --> 10:25.580
Don't worry about it.
I'm getting close.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.649
Well, doyou think he knows Carla?

10:27.727 --> 10:32.721
As far as I can tell, he knows everyone who's
set foot on a farm in the northern hemisphere.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.959
How'd that thing with Ivan go?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.059
Not as well as I was hoping.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.434
I followed him all day.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.599
It's prettyclear
hejust collects the money.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.371
Stays away from the girls till it's over.
It's smart security.

10:45.444 --> 10:49.107
Ifhe has no contact with his guys,
no calls, no conversations...

10:49.181 --> 10:53.880
then the cops can't make a decent case,
and we can't find the girls.

10:53.953 --> 10:57.582
Ifwe're gonna find the girls by Friday,
we'll need to extract the information.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.852
How 'bout it, Sam?

10:59.925 --> 11:01.916
Interrogation? Well, it's--

11:01.994 --> 11:04.758
It's been a while, Mikey,
but, you know, it's just like riding a bike.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.890
Ifwe can snatch him by this afternoon,
we'll have three days to work on him.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.697
Oh, that's cuttin' it close.
Maybe, ifwe hit the ground running...

11:10.770 --> 11:13.864
make him think he's up against the big boys--

35:53.012 --> 35:55.708
- [ Gunshot ]
- [ Sam ] Put it down!

35:55.782 --> 35:57.773
- I said drop it!
- [ Gunshot ]

35:57.851 --> 36:01.981
- Don 't-- Don 't kill me! No, please!
- [ Gunshots ]

36:04.958 --> 36:06.926
[ Keys Jangling ]

36:09.028 --> 36:11.690
Let's go.

36:14.434 --> 36:17.232
- Where is the other one?
- Back there.

36:17.303 --> 36:21.797
- I heard hi m beggi ng.
- After the beatings he gave me,
he deserves to die more slowly.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.002
We have to go to Romanov's.

36:24.077 --> 36:26.068
What, show up at Takarov's
empty-handed?

36:26.145 --> 36:28.978
No, we gotta show 'em
we thought ofthe organization first.

36:29.048 --> 36:32.040
Where are the girls?

36:32.118 --> 36:35.884
Ivan, we don't have time for this!
Where are the girls?

36:35.955 --> 36:38.788
They're in Hialeah. I will showyou.

37:04.584 --> 37:06.484
- This is it?
- Yes.

37:06.653 --> 37:08.985
You think they've been here?
Does anything look different?

37:09.055 --> 37:12.855
It's fine. See the van?
Means the girls are still here.

37:15.828 --> 37:18.626
- Where haveyou been?
- I'll tell you later. We need to move the girls now.

37:18.698 --> 37:22.327
- What? Who is he?
- This is Sergei. He's all right.

37:22.402 --> 37:24.199
Now move! Go!

37:29.008 --> 37:30.942
[ Russian ]

37:36.115 --> 37:38.310
[ Russian ]

37:43.823 --> 37:46.451
- We have to get them out ofhere.
- Doyou have a place?

37:46.526 --> 37:50.087
Yes. There is another safe house
that Takarov uses for guns.

37:50.163 --> 37:52.154
How doyou know the C.I.A.
isn't already there?

37:52.231 --> 37:55.029
- We can't use anyplace they might know about.
- Then where can we take them?

37:55.101 --> 37:57.968
I got a place down by the docks.
No one knows about it but me.

37:58.037 --> 38:00.528
You're sure it's safe?

38:00.607 --> 38:04.976
You're right. I should bring some ofyour guys,
take some guns along,just in case.

38:05.044 --> 38:08.036
You go to Takarov's. You tell them
they might be moving on Romanov's.

38:08.114 --> 38:11.914
- Who knows? We might come out heroes.
- All right.

38:15.788 --> 38:18.086
- Da.
- Sergei.

38:18.157 --> 38:22.355
- I don't forget this.
- I'm sure you won't, Ivan.

38:23.997 --> 38:27.694
- [ CarDoorOpens, Closes ]
- [Engine Starts ]

38:29.268 --> 38:31.668
There's been a change of plans.

38:33.172 --> 38:36.767
- [ Screams ]
- It's all over. Drop the gun.

38:43.483 --> 38:45.542
[ Women Gasping ]

38:50.623 --> 38:53.114
[Michael Narrating]
In the spygame,you spenda lot oftime...

38:53.192 --> 38:55.217
gettingpeople to betraytheir own.

38:55.294 --> 38:58.127
Most do it for money.
Some do it for spite.

38:58.197 --> 39:01.792
But the greatest achievement is
to get a guy to turn on his own people...

39:01.868 --> 39:04.428
because he thinks he's being loyal.

39:04.504 --> 39:07.029
- You have to get out.
- What? What are you tal ki ng about?

39:07.106 --> 39:09.666
They busted the operation in Tampa.
They're coming here next.

39:09.742 --> 39:12.575
- They had me and Sergei, but we escaped.
- What operation in Tampa?

39:12.645 --> 39:14.806
We never had an operation in Tampa.

39:15.882 --> 39:19.579
- But-- But Sergei--
- Who's Sergei?

39:19.652 --> 39:23.713
He took the girls!
He said he worked foryou in Tampa!

39:23.790 --> 39:27.886
It was the C.I.A. They had us.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.985
You talked to the C.I.A.?

39:31.264 --> 39:34.233
You gave the girls to this Sergei...

39:34.300 --> 39:36.234
and then you come here?

39:38.838 --> 39:40.806
Take him upstairs... now!

39:41.874 --> 39:44.035
[ Grunting ]

39:47.080 --> 39:49.378
Sam talked to a police buddy ofhis.

39:49.449 --> 39:53.442
Sounds like Takarov was worried enough
to skip town with most ofhis crew.

39:53.519 --> 39:56.215
Apparently, he headed north,
because they found Ivan's body...

39:56.289 --> 39:58.314
in a Dumpster in Fort Lauderdale.

39:58.391 --> 40:00.859
Dumpster is too good for him.

40:00.927 --> 40:02.861
What my sister means say
is thankyou.

40:02.929 --> 40:05.159
- Yeah.
- [ Groans ]

40:07.533 --> 40:10.593
- How is your pain?
- Breathing's a little difficult.

40:10.670 --> 40:12.763
Mike cracked three of my ribs.

40:13.873 --> 40:16.774
But, you know,
it was a small price to pay.

40:19.045 --> 40:21.240
I'm sorry I was angry.

40:21.314 --> 40:24.875
Nate said you know what to do.
Always you are right.

40:24.951 --> 40:27.613
This Nate? Nate said that?

40:27.687 --> 40:29.678
You wanted me to keep her at Mom's.

40:29.756 --> 40:32.987
I just said what I had to say.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.960
Thank Nate, Katya.

40:37.029 --> 40:40.328
I couldn't have done it without him,
and I'm not always right.

41:00.820 --> 41:02.754
[ Sighs ]

41:02.822 --> 41:07.521
$1,350, and all Sam got on Carla
was a P.O. box.

41:07.593 --> 41:09.254
More than I had, Fi.

41:09.328 --> 41:13.196
Besides, I don't think he could have survived
any more intelligence gathering.

41:13.266 --> 41:15.757
Well, Sam's liver can take a vacation
while we--

41:17.503 --> 41:20.404
- What do we do now?
- Now we watch.

41:20.473 --> 41:23.237
Someone's gotta
pick up the mail sometime.

41:24.510 --> 41:27.536
[Sighs ]
I hatesurveillance.

41:29.682 --> 41:33.277
?? [Rock]

41:33.352 --> 41:35.843
[Michael Narrating] Intelligence gathering
isn't all running around with a gun...

41:35.922 --> 41:37.890
and a spy camera.

41:37.957 --> 41:42.087
When the operation demands it, you get to
sit in a hot car with no air-conditioning...

41:42.161 --> 41:44.755
in downtown Miami.
