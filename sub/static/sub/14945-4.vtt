00:26.444 --> 00:29.231
when that kind of persuasion
comes looking for you?

00:29.322 --> 00:30.983
Because it will.

Save it for
the debrief...

12:17.112 --> 12:19.228
How long has
your mother suffered
from Alzheimer's?

12:19.323 --> 12:20.654
Six years.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.774
The doctor says she's
done pretty well,
considering.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.485
She's still there,
you know.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.655
But sometimes
I'm her son,
other times...

12:31.251 --> 12:33.583
But this is
palliative care.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.331
She in liver
failure now.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.162
That's why we're here.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.590
I really appreciate
you letting me
come visit.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.633
Hopefully
it's a good night.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.131
She really perked up
when I mentioned

12:44.222 --> 12:46.008
you were looking
for this suit.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.844
Hi, Mom, I brought
that police officer
we talked about.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.851
Hi, Mrs. Stanton.

the same, Kiera.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.161
Elena?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.623
What took you so long?

13:28.266 --> 13:31.474
In the first months
I looked for anyone else
from the execution chamber

13:31.561 --> 13:33.517
that might have come
through with me but...

13:35.190 --> 13:36.396
No one.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.723
No one.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.062

13:41.279 --> 13:42.530

13:50.288 --> 13:51.903
No one understands,
who can you tell?

13:51.999 --> 13:54.240
But you must have,
I mean,
you got married...

13:54.334 --> 13:55.790
I never told.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.540
I wanted to be normal.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.122
And my husband,

14:03.427 --> 14:04.837
he gave me that.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.428
And so much more.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.221
What about your
husband, Kiera,
and Sam?

14:13.603 --> 14:14.592
Didn't they come with you?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.764
Elena, when you
came through,

14:19.443 --> 14:21.525
you were wearing
your CPS uniform, right?

14:21.611 --> 14:22.600
Yes.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.186
Yes, so...

14:27.743 --> 14:29.279
I took it out
kayaking, you know?

14:29.953 --> 14:32.615
I've loved that since
I was a kid.
I went out this morning.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.367

17:34.763 --> 17:35.752
They probably
kept in touch.

had a family...

all in school,

you were here,

that weren't there.

if the owner
wasn't wearing it?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.908
Well, the suit
has certain latent
functions on its own.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.743
Something called
a positional
contact relay.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.166
It’s basically like
a homing beacon.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.374
It’ll ping the user’s CMR
and then you can triangulate
the suit’s location.

24:29.594 --> 24:30.754
What if it's
out of power?

24:31.763 --> 24:33.594
That's doubtful,
I mean these suits
can draw a charge

they come in contact with.

turn on their CMR,

link it to the suit
and send a steady signal.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.395
Maybe he did.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.279
You gonna give me one
of your Rosara speeches?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.072

the jokes for
the epilogue?

25:35.159 --> 25:36.820
This is not
a TV show.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.990
This is your life.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.542
You were shot!

25:44.210 --> 25:45.495
And now you think
you're invulnerable

25:45.586 --> 25:47.668
because of that
stupid costume!

25:47.755 --> 25:50.292
You saw what happened.
Yeah.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.967

I should have
been burned!

something happens,

25:55.346 --> 25:58.213

I saved that guy's life!

26:05.273 --> 26:06.638
Okay.

Okay, look.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.067

26:12.613 --> 26:13.693

27:01.662 --> 27:02.651
Why don't we
just help each other?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.862
I don't think
our methods
are compatible.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.036
I'm sure you could talk
to your Mr. Escher

27:08.127 --> 27:10.413
and let him know
I'm one of the
good guys, no?

27:12.215 --> 27:15.548
Ah, so it's Escher
you really want.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.544
Well, he's the one
pulling your strings,
isn't he?

let's drive over to
Piron Corps right now,

my sick friend.

You're connected
to these terrorists.

that a good agent

he or she is tracking.

But, until you
get truthful with me,

27:51.170 --> 27:53.456

wanted to say hi.
Didn't you, honey?

28:40.469 --> 28:42.630

So pink.

He's right.
Listen, partner.

29:06.454 --> 29:08.410
I think Liber8 knows
about your suit.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.406
I can't let them get
their hands on it,

29:11.792 --> 29:13.532
and I need you
to help me find it.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.660

what I can do
from this bed.

with the suit,

29:28.309 --> 29:29.890
I know it makes
you nervous,

29:29.977 --> 29:31.968
but when
we were together
during the wars,

29:33.022 --> 29:34.933
I always felt
safer with you
as my partner.

29:35.358 --> 29:36.939
It's been too long.

the strong one.

when I meet him.

You were
a tonic for her.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.896
I don't know
if that's true.

41:33.033 --> 41:34.739
She said

41:35.327 --> 41:36.316
you should
have this.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.277
She must have read it
a dozen times.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.738
Only Connect.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.623
It's a little
sermon, really,

41:43.960 --> 41:45.416
about ending isolation.

41:47.673 --> 41:50.085
She wanted you to know
that she loved her life,

41:50.509 --> 41:51.624
and you can too.

41:53.053 --> 41:54.042
Excuse me.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.254
I'm sorry
for your loss.

42:06.608 --> 42:07.848
Sure you
don't want to
go out there with them?

42:08.944 --> 42:10.434
Who would have imagined,

42:11.738 --> 42:13.399
she has such
a beautiful family.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.030
(SIGHING)

42:20.288 --> 42:21.448
Am I ever going
to meet your family?

42:26.795 --> 42:29.002
You have no idea

42:30.006 --> 42:30.995
how much
I would love that.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.297
Have you seen
your son lately?

42:34.428 --> 42:36.009
Oh, yeah...

42:37.139 --> 42:39.300
(SOBBING) I see him
all the time.
