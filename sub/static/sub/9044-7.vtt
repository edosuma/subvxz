WEBVTT

00:04.967 --> 00:06.667
- HEY, CUTIE.

00:06.667 --> 00:09.033
- WHAT?

00:09.033 --> 00:10.067
- NOTHING.

00:10.067 --> 00:12.367
YOU'RE JUST CUTE.

00:15.167 --> 00:18.867
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:18.867 --> 00:22.267
- OKAY, I SCREWED UP.

00:22.267 --> 00:24.467
YOU KNOW HOW MY MOM
IS COMING FOR THANKSGIVING?

00:24.467 --> 00:25.600
- YEAH.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.700
- WELL, LAST NIGHT,
I SORT OF...

00:28.700 --> 00:30.400
INVITED MY FATHER TOO.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.867
- HUH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:31.867 --> 00:33.400
THEY'RE DIVORCED.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.367
YOU CAN'T INVITE THEM
TO THE SAME PLACE ANYMORE.

00:35.367 --> 00:39.200
THEY LEGALLY AGREED
TO NOT LIKE EACH OTHER.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.500
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.700
HE TOLD ME
HE WAS GONNA BE

00:43.700 --> 00:45.400
IN MADAGASCAR
FOR THANKSGIVING,

00:45.400 --> 00:46.833
SO JUST TO BE NICE,
YOU KNOW, I SAID,

00:46.833 --> 00:48.367
"OH, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU CAN'T COME TOO.

00:48.367 --> 00:49.667
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU."

00:49.667 --> 00:51.300
AND THEN LAST NIGHT,
HE CALLED AND SAID

00:51.300 --> 00:53.033
HE PUT THE WHOLE TRIP OFF,
AND HE'S COMING.

00:53.033 --> 00:56.600
- OH, WHY ARE YOU NICE?

00:56.600 --> 00:58.300
- I KNOW,
BUT YOUR MOM SAID

00:58.300 --> 01:00.067
THAT MY MOM COULD STAY
AT YOUR HOUSE,

01:00.067 --> 01:01.400
AND THE KIDS WILL STAY
IN ONE ROOM.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.200
MY DAD WILL TAKE OUR ROOM,
AND THEN--

01:03.200 --> 01:06.433
- WHOA, YOU GAVE YOUR DAD
MY BED?

01:06.433 --> 01:09.767
THE MAN SLEEPS NAKED
AND SPOONS THE PILLOW.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.800
- I'LL GET THE PILLOW
OUT OF THERE.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.333
- GET THE MAN OUT OF THERE!

01:19.267 --> 01:20.833
- HE'S GOT A BAD BACK.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.667
HE NEEDS THE FIRM MATTRESS.

01:22.667 --> 01:23.833
- UGH.

01:23.833 --> 01:24.833
- I'M SORRY, RAY.

01:24.833 --> 01:25.833
WHAT CAN I DO?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.133
LOOK, THEY'RE COMING,

01:27.133 --> 01:29.167
AND WE JUST HAVE TO BOTH
SUFFER THROUGH IT.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.700
- YEAH, BY "WE,"
YOU MEAN "ME AND MY PILLOW."

01:31.700 --> 01:34.667
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT,

01:34.667 --> 01:37.800
AND ALL I GET IS,
"HEY, CUTIE"?

01:37.800 --> 01:38.733
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:44.767 --> 01:46.033
- YEAH.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.700
I'M JUST SAYING,
THIS TOOK FIVE MINUTES.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.433
THAT TAKES THREE.

01:57.233 --> 01:59.700
- SO, R-R-RAYMOND.

02:01.267 --> 02:02.333
HOW'S EVERYTHING

02:02.333 --> 02:06.200
IN EL MUNDO DE LOS DEPORTES?

02:07.633 --> 02:09.400
- WHAT?

02:09.400 --> 02:12.067
- HOLA.
THE WORLD OF THE SPORTS.

02:12.067 --> 02:14.400
- HA!
GOOD.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.167
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.467
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO

02:18.467 --> 02:22.100
HELP THE EL WIFE-O
EL OLEANTA.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.167
DON'T LEAVE ME LIKE THAT.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.167
- IT'S GOING WELL, HUH?

02:29.167 --> 02:30.333
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE TENSE,

02:30.333 --> 02:31.333
BUT IT'S NOT TENSE.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.333
I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS,

02:32.333 --> 02:34.467
BUT I THINK I'M FINE.

02:34.467 --> 02:35.900
- YEAH, YOU'RE DOING FINE.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.200
- YEAH, WELL, I'M GLAD
IT WORKED OUT THIS WAY,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.267
THE BOTH OF THEM
BEING HERE.

02:38.267 --> 02:39.467
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

02:39.467 --> 02:42.600
- GET MY PILLOW.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.467
- YOU GOT ANYTHING IN HERE
I CAN POISON MYSELF WITH?

02:47.467 --> 02:51.333
- LISTEN, I KNOW I'M BIG,
BUT WHERE CAN I HIDE?

02:56.133 --> 02:57.867
- THIS STINKS.

02:57.867 --> 03:00.233
I THOUGHT THOSE TWO WERE GONNA
DUKE IT OUT ALL WEEKEND.

03:00.233 --> 03:02.800
- AH, NOPE.
THEY GET ALONG GREAT.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.300
- I SAY THEY'RE FAKING IT.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.767
IF I WEREN'T
LOVING THESE CHIPS SO MUCH,

03:05.767 --> 03:07.400
I'D GO BACK IN THERE
AND POKE A FEW HOLES

03:07.400 --> 03:10.200
IN THEIR PHONY
HAPPY DIVORCE CRAP.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
WHAT AM I SAYING?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.333
I CAN DO BOTH.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.033
- NO, NO, NO, DAD,
COME ON, ALL RIGHT?

03:18.033 --> 03:20.500
LOOK, I ALREADY LOST MY BED.
I DON'T NEED AN ANGRY WIFE.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.900
SO PLEASE
DO ME A FAVOR.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.533
DON'T BE HORRIBLE TODAY.

03:23.533 --> 03:26.267
- IT'S MY THANKSGIVING TOO.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.800
- LISTEN, RAY'S RIGHT,
DAD, OKAY?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
DON'T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.433
UNLESS IT'LL GET THE MEAN
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM,

03:35.433 --> 03:37.733
AND THEN YOU CAN BE
EXTRA NICE TOMORROW

03:37.733 --> 03:40.133
WHEN AMY'S PARENTS COME.

03:41.467 --> 03:44.067
- I CAN'T PREDICT THESE THINGS.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.300
- WHAT WAS THAT, HUH?

03:48.300 --> 03:50.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
TELLING HIM TO BE MEAN TODAY?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.333
- HEY, LISTEN, I STILL HAVE
A CHANCE WITH AMY'S PARENTS.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.700
YOUR FAMILY'S ALREADY
SHOT TO HELL.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.767
- GOSH, DADDY,

03:58.767 --> 04:00.800
MADAGASCAR SOUNDS GREAT.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.567
- I'VE BEEN DYING TO GO.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.933
- WELL, SEEING AS HOW YOU TWO
ARE SO CHUMMY,

04:04.933 --> 04:08.467
MAYBE WARREN
WILL TAKE YOU WITH HIM.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.333
- NO, THANK YOU.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.967
NO MORE TRAVELING WITH WARREN.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.233
HE SPENDS ALL OF HIS TIME

04:12.233 --> 04:14.567
LOOKING AT HIS
TIP CONVERSION CHART.

04:14.567 --> 04:17.167
[laughter]

04:17.167 --> 04:20.900
- AH, YOU TWO TOOK
SOME AMAZING TRIPS TOGETHER.

04:20.900 --> 04:24.833
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS PEACHY.

04:24.833 --> 04:27.467
WARREN, WHAT ABOUT
AL, AL, THE LADIES' PAL?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.167
- DAD.
- WHAT'S THAT, FRANK?

04:29.167 --> 04:32.100
- AL E. MONY.

04:37.700 --> 04:41.367
THAT'S GOT TO BE A BIG BITE
OUT OF YOUR ASS, HUH?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.433
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.600
- YEAH.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.033
FRANK, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO--

04:48.033 --> 04:51.100
- SHH!
MEAN TONIGHT, NICE TOMORROW.

04:56.033 --> 04:58.000
- IT'S OKAY, DEB.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.633
FRANK KNOWS
THAT YOUR MOTHER AND I

05:00.633 --> 05:02.267
HAVE REACHED A POINT
WHERE WE CAN LAUGH

05:02.267 --> 05:03.600
ABOUT OUR DIVORCE.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.567
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE FINE WITH IT.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.800
- WELL, I JUST THINK
IT'S WONDERFUL

05:07.800 --> 05:10.933
THAT YOU TWO ARE ABLE
TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE

05:10.933 --> 05:14.367
AND NOT WASTE ANY TIME WORRYING
ABOUT ETERNAL DAMNATION.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.233
- MA!

05:23.233 --> 05:24.800
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE
CALL IT A NIGHT?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.667
I HAVE A LOT TO GET READY
FOR TOMORROW'S DINNER.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.633
- YES, AND I SHOULD WORK
ON MY "JUST IN CASE" TURKEY.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.667
- ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.900
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.800
- AND, DEBRA,
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.167
BYE-BYE.
- BYE.

05:41.167 --> 05:42.600
- GET THE MEAN
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM?

05:42.600 --> 05:43.900
- NOPE.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.433
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING
AMY'S PARENTS TOMORROW.

05:52.233 --> 05:55.167
- WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER PACK IT IN TOO.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.567
THANKS, RAYMOND,
FOR LENDING ME YOUR BED.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.933
- [laughs]
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.633
- GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.600
- YOU KNOW, IT GETS
A LITTLE CHILLY UP THERE

06:02.600 --> 06:04.667
IN CASE YOU WANT TO BORROW
A PAIR OF THE OLD PJs.

06:04.667 --> 06:08.067
- NO, I'M FINE
AU NATUREL.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.467
BESIDES, MY BODY'S
LIKE A FURNACE.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.467
- WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.833
IT'S NOT THANKSGIVING

06:19.833 --> 06:22.200
TILL YOU GOT A SWEATY
OLD MAN IN YOUR BED.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.667
- YOU KNOW, YOUR PARENTS
ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

06:30.667 --> 06:33.633
AL E. MONY?
IS YOUR FATHER INSANE?

06:35.567 --> 06:37.300
YOUR MOTHER
ALWAYS BRINGING UP HELL,

06:37.300 --> 06:40.900
AS IF CREATING IT
ALL AROUND HER ISN'T ENOUGH.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.033
- YOUR PARENTS SEEMED TO HANDLE
EVERYTHING PRETTY GOOD.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.133
THEY SEEM FINE WITH EVERYTHING.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.200
- THAT WAS JUST AN ACT.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.367
THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST

06:46.367 --> 06:47.767
OF AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.267
- YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.

06:49.267 --> 06:51.567
THEIR DIVORCE IS BETTER
THAN MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.467
- I SHOULD BE HAPPY?

06:56.467 --> 06:58.433
I SHOULD BE HAPPY
THAT AFTER 41 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

06:58.433 --> 06:59.833
MY PARENTS CAN JUST
LAUGH AND LAUGH

06:59.833 --> 07:01.900
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA BE TOGETHER AGAIN?

07:01.900 --> 07:03.033
YEAH, RAY,
I'M SO HAPPY.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.533
LISTEN, RAY.

07:26.533 --> 07:30.133
I'M SORRY ABOUT GOING
ALL CRAZY BEFORE.

07:30.133 --> 07:33.600
- OH, HMM.
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.400
- I GUESS
I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT

07:35.400 --> 07:39.033
THAT MY PARENTS,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

07:40.067 --> 07:41.600
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.533
IF THEY'RE HAPPY
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE,

07:43.533 --> 07:46.667
THEN I SHOULD
BE FINE WITH IT TOO.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.333
- YEAH?

07:48.333 --> 07:51.600
- YEAH.
I'M FINE.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.100
- GOOD.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.000
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
ALL RIGHT?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.633
- YEAH.

08:01.633 --> 08:05.367
- SO IT'S OKAY TO ASK
WHERE MY PILLOW IS?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.467
- OH, YEAH,
I FORGOT IT.

08:08.467 --> 08:10.967
- YEAH, YOUR FATHER'S PROBABLY

08:10.967 --> 08:13.667
ALL OVER IT BY NOW.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.367
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK HE'S STILL UP.

08:15.367 --> 08:17.500
I HEARD HIM BRUSHING HIS TEETH
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.467
- OH, GOD.

08:18.467 --> 08:20.100
I GOT TO GET IT
BEFORE HE MAKES IT

08:20.100 --> 08:22.200
INTO A THIGH SANDWICH.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.667
- OH, WARREN,
YOU'RE SO IMPATIENT.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.267
- WAS HE NAKED?

09:09.400 --> 09:12.100
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GO GET IT.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.200
- NO!
- RAY!

09:25.200 --> 09:26.533
- YOU CAN'T GO NEAR THERE.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.100
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.533
- JUST--JUST SLEEP NOW.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.100
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.667
- HE AND YOUR MOTHER
ARE GETTING IT ON!

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
- WHAT?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.033
- IT WAS HORRIBLE.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.233
SHE WAS ALL,
AND HE WAS ALL AND...

09:46.233 --> 09:47.767
- ARE YOU SURE
THEY WERE DOING THAT?

09:47.767 --> 09:51.467
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK
THE HAIRS ON MY NECK?

09:56.100 --> 09:58.500
- YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.333
I COULD TELL THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.100
- YES!
MY PILLOW!

10:07.300 --> 10:10.633
- SHE MUST HAVE SNUCK OVER HERE.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.133
HOW CUTE IS THAT?

10:12.133 --> 10:13.200
- IT'S NOT CUTE!

10:13.200 --> 10:14.267
- OH, LISTEN.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.400
YOU--YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.767
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

10:16.767 --> 10:18.633
'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS
ARE STILL MARRIED.

10:18.633 --> 10:19.600
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.667
- NO, NO,
YOU TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

10:21.667 --> 10:22.767
THESE ARE MY PARENTS,

10:22.767 --> 10:25.000
AND IT REALLY HURT
WHEN THEY GOT DIVORCED.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.967
THAT'S WHY
THIS IS SO GREAT.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.800
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:28.800 --> 10:29.800
- TO SAY HI.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.567
- ARE YOU CRAZY, WOMAN?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.033
- OH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.367
IT MIGHT BE EMBARRASSING.

10:36.367 --> 10:38.633
- AND IT'LL BURN YOUR RETINAS.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.533
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

10:42.533 --> 10:44.767
WE'LL JUST PRETEND
THAT WE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.767
- OKAY.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.133
OKAY.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.200
I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.733
- [humming]

11:00.833 --> 11:02.867
- BUENOS DIAS, TODOS.

11:02.867 --> 11:04.767
- [laughs]
MORNING, DADDY.

11:04.767 --> 11:05.900
YOU SURE SLEPT LATE.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.067
- YEAH.
THAT IS SOME BED.

11:13.267 --> 11:15.100
- OKAY.
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.433
THEY IN THE YARD?
ALL RIGHT.

11:16.433 --> 11:19.867
I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF THEY'RE SMOKING.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.367
- GOOD MORNING, RAYMOND.

11:21.367 --> 11:24.133
- HI, I'M GONNA GO OUT
AND PLAY WITH THE KIDS.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.800
- YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SHOES ON.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.367
- NO.
OKAY, I DON'T.

11:27.367 --> 11:30.100
- WELL, COME.
HAVE BREAKFAST WITH US, HMM?

11:30.100 --> 11:31.667
- HM, OKAY.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.967
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE HUNGRY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

11:34.967 --> 11:36.567
- GOOD MORNING, DEBRA.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.800
- HI, MOM.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.800
- GOOD MORNING,
WARREN.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.300
- GOOD MORNING, LOIS.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.267
HOW WAS EVERYTHING
ACROSS THE STREET LAST NIGHT?

11:42.267 --> 11:43.800
- OH, FINE.
I HAD A WONDERFUL SLEEP.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.867
HOW ABOUT YOU?

11:44.867 --> 11:46.600
- GREAT.
FEEL LIKE A NEW MAN.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.667
THESE TWO HAVE
A TERRIFIC MATTRESS.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.300
- OH, I'LL HAVE TO TRY IT OUT
SOMETIME.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.867
WHAT'S THE MATTER, RAYMOND?

12:00.867 --> 12:02.233
- OH, NOTHING.
NO.

12:02.233 --> 12:05.200
I JUST--I HAD A BAD,
BAD DREAM LAST NIGHT.

12:07.133 --> 12:10.133
- OKAY, EGGS FOR MOM,
EGGS FOR DAD.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.000
EGGS FOR MOM AND DAD.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.600
- THANKS, HONEY BUNNY.
- YEAH.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.967
OH, IT SURE IS GOOD
TO SEE YOU TWO SO HUNGRY AGAIN.

12:16.967 --> 12:17.967
- WHAT'S THAT, DEAR?

12:17.967 --> 12:20.500
- OKAY.
NOTHING.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO BORROW
MARIE'S ROASTING PAN,

12:22.500 --> 12:24.233
SO I'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE.

12:24.233 --> 12:28.700
EVERYBODY BEHAVE THEMSELVES.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.133
- OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU THINK SHE KNOWS?

12:33.133 --> 12:34.633
RAYMOND...

12:34.633 --> 12:35.867
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.733
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
JUST EAT YOUR EGGS.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.400
- THEY KNOW.
THEY HEARD US.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.267
- I TOLD YOU
TO KEEP IT DOWN.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.933
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.167
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.367
I'M GONNA GO,
BUT, UH...

12:51.367 --> 12:53.400
DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.033
DEBRA JUST--SHE'S HAPPY

12:55.033 --> 12:57.200
THAT YOU TWO GUYS
ARE BACK TOGETHER,

12:57.200 --> 12:58.667
SO...SO HAPPY THANKSGIVING,

12:58.667 --> 13:01.733
AND IF I DON'T SEE YOU,
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

13:01.733 --> 13:02.833
- RAYMOND, WAIT.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.433
- GOD!

13:05.867 --> 13:08.933
- I THINK THERE'S BEEN
A MISINTERPRETATION.

13:08.933 --> 13:12.233
- YEAH, RAY, WE'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.800
- YEAH, BUT...

13:17.800 --> 13:19.400
YOU GUYS WERE...

13:19.400 --> 13:21.333
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.867
- SO THAT WAS JUST...

13:24.867 --> 13:27.067
- SEX.
- AAH!

13:34.367 --> 13:37.667
- BUT DEBRA THINKS
IT'S SOMETHING MORE?

13:37.667 --> 13:39.867
- YEAH, SHE DOES.

13:39.867 --> 13:42.067
- OH, DEAR.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.333
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.400
COME ON,
MAYBE DEBRA'S RIGHT.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT

13:48.000 --> 13:50.633
WASN'T THE START OF YOU TWO GUYS
GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

13:50.633 --> 13:52.667
- WELL, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

13:52.667 --> 13:54.467
LAST NIGHT
WASN'T THE FIRST TIME.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.500
- YOU GUYS GOT TO GET
A SCRABBLE BOARD.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.600
ALL RIGHT.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.767
WELL, I MEAN,
LET'S JUST THINK THIS OUT.

14:08.767 --> 14:10.033
YOU GUYS,

14:10.033 --> 14:11.300
YOU'RE GETTING ALONG
PRETTY GOOD

14:11.300 --> 14:13.600
IN EVERY...DEPARTMENT.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.467
SO WHY NOT JUST SLAP A COUPLE
OF FRESH "I DO"S ON THERE

14:17.467 --> 14:19.533
AND MAKE THIS
THE BEST THANKSGIVING EVER?

14:19.533 --> 14:21.567
- RAYMOND,
WE'RE NOT IN LOVE.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.167
- LOVE.
[scoffs]

14:25.067 --> 14:27.133
- WE HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.367
- I GUESS I BETTER
GET DRESSED.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.233
- OH, WOULD YOU
BRING DOWN MY EARRINGS?

14:31.233 --> 14:33.133
I LEFT THEM
ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.367
- I DIDN'T SEE 'EM.

14:34.367 --> 14:35.600
- WELL, THEY'RE THERE.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.633
- NO.

14:36.633 --> 14:37.800
I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER

14:37.800 --> 14:40.400
NOT SEEING EARRINGS
ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.267
- HOW CAN A PERSON
SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER

14:43.267 --> 14:45.067
NOT SEEING SOMETHING?

14:45.067 --> 14:46.733
OH, I'LL GET 'EM MYSELF.

14:46.733 --> 14:49.167
- FINE, BUT THEY'RE
NOT THERE.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.100
- OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE!

14:53.400 --> 14:56.000
- NOT IN LOVE?
COME ON!

14:58.467 --> 15:00.600
- HERE WE ARE!
- OH, HEY, DEB.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.067
AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.167
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.633
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

15:05.633 --> 15:08.433
- DEBRA SAID SHE NEEDED
MY ROASTING PAN,

15:08.433 --> 15:12.367
WHICH I RECOGNIZED
WAS A CRY FOR HELP.

15:12.367 --> 15:15.067
DON'T WORRY.
I CAN SALVAGE THIS MEAL.

15:15.067 --> 15:18.100
- COME ON, DAD.
PREGAME'S ON.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.133
- SORRY, DEB.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.967
- NO, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:20.967 --> 15:22.900
IT'S GREAT
THAT EVERYBODY'S TOGETHER,

15:22.900 --> 15:25.133
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT THANKSGIVING
IS ALL ABOUT--

15:25.133 --> 15:27.033
FAMILIES BEING TOGETHER.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.533
- DID YOU HAVE
A DRINK TODAY ALREADY?

15:37.667 --> 15:38.867
- NO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:38.867 --> 15:41.600
I WANT TO TOAST MY PARENTS
AT DINNER TONIGHT.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.333
YEAH, WHERE IS THAT BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE

15:43.333 --> 15:45.133
WE FORGOT TO GIVE ROBERT AND AMY
FOR THEIR WEDDING?

15:45.133 --> 15:47.567
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHY DON'T
YOU TALK TO YOUR PARENTS FIRST?

15:47.567 --> 15:49.333
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT
INTO BEING TOASTED.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.133
- NO, NO, NO, 'CAUSE I WANT IT
TO BE A SURPRISE.

15:51.133 --> 15:52.267
AH!
HERE IT IS.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.467
- YEAH, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK

15:53.467 --> 15:55.033
YOU SHOULD MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS.

15:55.033 --> 15:56.633
- WHY NOT?
- WELL...

15:56.633 --> 15:58.000
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.233
YOUR PARENTS--THEY'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

16:01.233 --> 16:02.967
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:02.967 --> 16:03.967
YOU SAW THEM.

16:03.967 --> 16:05.367
- YEAH, I DID,

16:05.367 --> 16:07.300
AND I STILL SEE 'EM
EVERY TIME I BLINK.

16:11.167 --> 16:14.567
THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS
JUST, LIKE, A CASUAL...

16:14.567 --> 16:16.133
RENDEZVOUS.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.367
- YOU MEAN THEY'RE JUST...

16:20.367 --> 16:22.733
- A COUPLE OF HORN DOGS.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.800
YEAH.

16:28.800 --> 16:29.733
SORRY.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.467
- I GOT TO GO TALK TO THEM.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.500
- WHAT HAPPENED?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.733
- AH, SHE JUST FOUND OUT
THAT HER PARENTS ARE...

16:45.733 --> 16:47.367
STILL DIVORCED.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.467
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

16:51.467 --> 16:54.033
WITH LOIS SNEAKING OUT
OF OUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT

16:54.033 --> 16:56.033
IN HER BATHROBE.

17:03.667 --> 17:07.533
- AND SHE DIDN'T GET BACK
TILL 4:00 A.M.

17:07.533 --> 17:10.300
I REMEMBER,
'CAUSE THAT'S MY THIRD PEE.

17:16.767 --> 17:17.800
- NO.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.433
NAH, IT WAS JUST--

17:19.433 --> 17:21.667
WARREN'S BACK WAS HURTING,
AND LOIS CAME BY TO HELP.

17:21.667 --> 17:22.667
THAT'S ALL.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.467
- OH, COME ON!

17:25.467 --> 17:26.400
[door slams]

17:28.833 --> 17:30.400
THEY'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

17:30.400 --> 17:31.333
- WHAT?

17:38.033 --> 17:39.333
OH, MY GOD,

17:39.333 --> 17:42.133
IT'S LIKE SPRING BREAK
UP THERE.

17:42.133 --> 17:44.067
- I KNEW IT.

17:44.067 --> 17:46.400
- DEBRA.
DEBRA!

17:51.567 --> 17:53.700
- ARE YOU GETTING
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN OR NOT?

17:53.700 --> 17:55.633
- WELL, NO, BUT--
- BUT WHAT? WHAT?

17:55.633 --> 17:57.033
IF YOU'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER,

17:57.033 --> 17:58.067
THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

17:58.067 --> 18:00.267
- HELLO.

18:03.433 --> 18:06.700
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
EVERYBODY.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.600
- MOM, DAD.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.567
- SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE MARRIED TO HAVE SEX.

18:18.633 --> 18:20.500
- IN FACT,
NOTHING HAS FREED US

18:20.500 --> 18:24.400
TO EXPLORE OUR SEXUALITY
MORE THAN OUR DIVORCE.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.867
- WE'RE REHEARSING

18:27.867 --> 18:30.500
FOR A LOCAL MUSICAL.

18:37.733 --> 18:38.867
- MOM!

18:38.867 --> 18:41.533
DAD!
PLEASE DON'T GO!

18:41.533 --> 18:44.200
- IT'S A MUSICAL.
WE'VE GOT A PART FOR YOU!

18:48.433 --> 18:50.833
- I GOT TO SAY, WARREN,
YOU PLAYED THIS ONE RIGHT.

18:50.833 --> 18:54.167
ALL THE BAGGIN',
NONE OF THE NAGGIN'.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.133
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, DAD, PLEASE.

19:00.133 --> 19:03.433
- DEBRA, WE ARE SO SORRY.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.733
WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.533
- I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE THINKING OF ME AT ALL,

19:07.533 --> 19:10.867
OR ANYBODY ELSE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.100
YOU'RE SNEAKING AROUND UP THERE.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.167
POOR RAY WALKS IN AND SEES YOU.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.267
- YOU SAW US?

19:17.267 --> 19:20.533
- NO, JUST, UH...JUST...

19:23.367 --> 19:27.233
JUST AN ARM
AND A FOOT AND...

19:27.233 --> 19:29.333
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTTOM.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.700
- I MEAN, HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON, HUH?

19:32.700 --> 19:34.433
WHAT, DID YOU CELEBRATE
THE SIGNING

19:34.433 --> 19:36.633
OF YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS
WITH A QUICK ROLL IN THE HAY?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.867
- NO, SWEETHEART,
IT'S JUST THAT

19:38.867 --> 19:41.333
WHEN YOU SPEND
HALF YOUR LIFE WITH SOMEONE

19:41.333 --> 19:44.033
AND THEN THEY'RE
NOT THERE ANYMORE,

19:44.033 --> 19:48.167
SOMETIMES IT GETS LONELY.

19:48.167 --> 19:50.300
- THEN YOU LOSE YOUR CONTROL
OF YOUR URGES,

19:50.300 --> 19:52.733
AND YOU DO UNSPEAKABLE THINGS.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.633
- OKAY, MARIE.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.967
SO YOU DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER
ENOUGH TO STAY MARRIED,

20:03.967 --> 20:07.400
BUT YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING
TOGETHER FOR ALL OF THAT.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.967
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY OTHER THAN,

20:10.967 --> 20:13.600
I GUESS GETTING TOGETHER
LIKE THAT

20:13.600 --> 20:17.467
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
JUST MAKES US HAPPY.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.267
- WELL, IF WE ALL JUST
DID THINGS THAT MADE US HAPPY,

20:20.267 --> 20:23.167
THIS WORLD WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE PLACE.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.400
- ALL RIGHT, MARIE.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.133
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT THRILLED
THAT MY PARENTS

20:30.133 --> 20:31.933
ARE STANDING IN MY LIVING ROOM
IN OUR SHEETS,

20:31.933 --> 20:33.500
BUT THEY'RE STILL MY PARENTS.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.100
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO 'EM?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.567
"I WANT YOU TO BE MISERABLE
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES,

20:37.567 --> 20:39.633
LIKE SOME PEOPLE"?

20:42.000 --> 20:46.367
- I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:46.367 --> 20:48.333
- I DO.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.167
- I JUST WISH
THINGS WERE DIFFERENT

20:58.167 --> 21:01.833
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, BUT...

21:01.833 --> 21:04.400
I DO WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

21:05.733 --> 21:09.500
- HOW ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL
OF OURS, HUH?

21:09.500 --> 21:12.667
I SURE KNOW
WHAT I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS YEAR.

21:12.667 --> 21:16.433
- YEAH, YEAH, HOW ABOUT YOU GO
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON?

21:16.433 --> 21:18.800
- OKAY.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.167
- AND BUY A SCRABBLE BOARD.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.367
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE PART IS.

21:38.367 --> 21:41.333
I DO NOT WANT
TO BE IN THAT MUSICAL.
