WEBVTT

00:04.170 --> 00:07.606
Yeah. 6-inch on wheat, no mayo.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.335
Hang on. Dr. Weird?

00:09.409 --> 00:13.573
My ass has finally decided to eat my hand!

00:14.114 --> 00:17.515
It hungers for more!

00:21.087 --> 00:22.520
Yeah. Just the one hoagie.

01:08.635 --> 01:12.469
Hey, Carl.
Man, you're looking good today.

01:12.839 --> 01:16.502
- You lost some weight, didn't you?
- Maybe a couple of pounds, you know.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.407
You're here about the termites,
aren't you?

01:18.478 --> 01:19.672
Yeah, partly.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.180
Certainly not gonna sign
for anymore packages...

01:22.248 --> 01:24.375
with the word "Congo" written in blood.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.919
Did the termites come?
I want to name mine Bobby.

01:26.986 --> 01:30.285
Come over and take your pick. Please.
There's millions to choose from.

01:30.356 --> 01:33.416
Bobby. Come here, boy.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.125
Come on, boy.

01:36.196 --> 01:39.165
We'll take Bobby off your hands.
You can handle the rest, right?

01:39.232 --> 01:42.599
Fine. You know, whenever.
Just before the house disappears.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.728
I got to say, you're taking this pretty well.

01:44.804 --> 01:47.272
You're usually pissed off
when we pull stuff like this.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.467
I don't lose my cool as much anymore.

01:49.542 --> 01:52.340
I've gone through some changes
in the past 24 hours.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.401
Come here, Bobby.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.075
- Do you have a brush I could borrow?
- We don't. We're all bald.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.242
I got me one.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.411
I use this for my teeth and my hair.

02:00.487 --> 02:04.253
Yeah, I forgot. I live next to
a third-world hellhole. Never mind.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.189
Wait a minute. Carl, I got what you need.

02:06.259 --> 02:09.193
Here's a ribcage from a chicken
I didn't eat.

02:09.262 --> 02:13.528
Now, cave men would actually use this
to straighten their hair in the olden days...

02:13.600 --> 02:17.195
No! No one touches this mane
with a fricking chicken bone.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.999
This cost me plenty.

02:19.072 --> 02:23.805
I mean, it's natural hair,
but I mean, it came from an animal.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.038
- Can you tell it's fake?
- Really? It's fake?

02:26.112 --> 02:28.740
Sure, yeah, it's fake.
What are you, stupid? Look at it.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.783
That's some damn space-age material
you got...

02:30.850 --> 02:31.874
Put the flame away.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.442
You all are being rude
to our only neighbor. Now stop.

02:34.521 --> 02:35.852
You're being rude to me.

02:35.922 --> 02:39.289
Don't chain me down with your manners.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.920
- All right, I guess I'll go buy a brush.
- You can buy this one!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.089
Could have sworn I had one
from middle school...

02:45.165 --> 02:46.996
It's gonna end up on your lawn anyway.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.065
"I couldn't help but notice
we made eye contact.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.967
"I really like your shoes.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.600
"Try laughter. Laughter is a good... "

02:56.676 --> 02:58.109
Screw this. This is lame.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.443
I saw you checking out my goods.
You want a sampling?

03:01.514 --> 03:05.450
A little try before you buy, huh?
Come here, bitch! Stand and deliver!

03:05.518 --> 03:08.954
"Come here, bitch"? Please. Be polite.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.856
- How did you fricking get in here?
- Powers. I have them.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.918
- So it was a rug!
- Of course it's a rug.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.486
Yeah, I frigging grew it overnight.

03:19.599 --> 03:23.091
Yeah, I knew it. I'm not dumb.
Just making conversation with you.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.636
Make it on your way out, okay?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.865
Look, I've dealt with a lot of rugs before.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.841
The number one thing
you don't want to do, is wear it to bed...

03:29.909 --> 03:31.171
because you will swallow it.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.144
Wasn't gonna do that.
Now get out of here!

03:33.213 --> 03:35.943
And you don't want to pass that thing,
let me tell you.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.779
Damn it. Fricking come off.

03:38.851 --> 03:42.150
You got the Boston box set.
I'm just gonna borrow this, okay?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.712
No, don't touch it!

03:43.790 --> 03:46.350
Damn it! Where's the frigging pry bar?

04:00.240 --> 04:03.141
Are you still asleep? Now listen up.

04:03.209 --> 04:06.007
You are playing a deadly game
wearing that wig to bed.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.603
You want to wake up hanging from it?

04:07.680 --> 04:10.171
- How did you get in here?
- Science fiction!

04:11.718 --> 04:13.310
Was my hair this curly last night?

04:13.386 --> 04:15.149
Why, are you fishing for compliments?

04:15.221 --> 04:17.620
That's a horrible personality trait.
Nobody likes...

04:17.690 --> 04:19.680
No. Look at my hair.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.652
It's actually rocking
a little harder now. Yeah!

04:23.730 --> 04:27.894
Your hair! It's always about
what you have and you own.

04:27.967 --> 04:31.494
Know this!
If you're an object, don't ever cross me.

04:31.571 --> 04:35.166
I proved it to your CD,
I proved it to your window...

04:35.241 --> 04:38.210
and I proved it to your record player
and your lawn mower...

04:38.278 --> 04:40.178
and I will prove it to anything else...

04:41.247 --> 04:42.407
I know.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.007
Man, I am looking good.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.416
Need to get that
"screaming for vengeance" shirt...

04:47.487 --> 04:49.011
and score big time!

04:49.088 --> 04:51.613
The clowning has begun.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.023
Who said? Someone say something?

04:55.228 --> 04:56.320
Hello?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.525
Frigging air vent.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.294
Prepare to scream for vengeance, ladies!

05:01.367 --> 05:03.801
God! I wanted him to see me say it!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.498
I wanted to say, "Me, over here. I said it. "

05:07.674 --> 05:09.869
Don't you want to occasionally
freak people out?

05:11.044 --> 05:12.033
You got it, bud.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.601
You think he won't figure it out...

05:13.680 --> 05:16.205
when his feet grow
to the size of pontoons?

05:17.717 --> 05:19.116
Look, I'll handle this, Bingo.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.745
You just go back to your little midget car...

05:21.821 --> 05:25.382
and your... big feet,
and you... fly around, man.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.890
Good, that means you're leaving.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.053
Now fricking go, you stupid clown.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.357
This is just one of my many
rental properties.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.958
I'm a rich man.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.569
Come on in.
Let's see where this 12-pack takes us.

05:41.641 --> 05:45.008
Frylock, someone's trying
to break into Carl's house.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.067
That is Carl, Meatwad.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.375
- That person got a woman.
- A woman?

05:48.448 --> 05:51.110
A woman? Hang on. Let me shave.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.313
Damn it, how do I shave?

05:57.123 --> 05:58.112
Solo!

06:07.567 --> 06:08.625
Oh, baby.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.360
- That's rocking.
- Yeah.

06:11.804 --> 06:15.672
Yeah, I wrote that.
It's called, "I want to rock your body. "

06:15.908 --> 06:18.468
And then in parentheses it says,
"to the break of dawn. "

06:18.544 --> 06:20.478
That's beautiful. It's like poetry.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.639
I want to rock your body, baby.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.473
Easy, big boy.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.348
- Take your shirt off!
- Shut up, man. She's gonna do it.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.819
Let's go! Let's see some skin!

06:28.888 --> 06:30.856
Pick me up. Let me see. I want to see.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.083
You're not mature enough.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.989
Twist those dirty bags!

06:34.060 --> 06:36.551
Don't you worry.
I'm getting rid of them right now.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.427
No. See if they want to join us.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.232
Jackpot!

06:42.301 --> 06:44.292
I knew there was something special
about you.

06:44.370 --> 06:46.497
I'm not just saying that
'cause you're a whore.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.767
But you are a total whore.

06:48.841 --> 06:51.901
Hey, the lady asked you a question, Carl.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.106
- No. No, that ain't happening here.
- Why not, Red?

06:55.181 --> 06:57.046
Red? Where's that coming from?

06:57.116 --> 07:00.449
You know, Carl,
sometimes hair dyes can be dangerous.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.383
Are you sure that thing if FDA approved?

07:02.455 --> 07:06.585
Yeah, hair dyes. I'm Duran Duran.
What are you frigging talking about?

07:06.692 --> 07:09.525
It looks like you might be having
a reaction to it.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.691
I don't color my hair. I ain't no fruit.
And I'm about to prove it to you.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.997
So you watch if you want,
'cause I think she kind of gets off on it.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.127
Damn it!

07:18.204 --> 07:20.502
There's something wrong with that wig.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.599
Wake up. Drink your beer.
Make you feel better, baby.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.109
We need to check it out. Let's go.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.611
No way. I'm checking this out.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.348
Moles?

07:29.415 --> 07:31.042
All right, wait for me.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.348
It's like a negative planetarium,
all that thing.

07:35.087 --> 07:36.714
'Cause she's got all those moles!

07:36.789 --> 07:38.654
- I get it.
- You gotta work with me on this.

07:38.724 --> 07:40.419
It ain't making me laugh, but I get it.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.394
All right. You know,
you guys take the fun out of living.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.254
Oh, my God! Just as I thought.
Shake, take a look at this.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.230
It's a classic case. It's by the book.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.663
- He's got it, doesn't he?
- That's right.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.733
His hair possesses a strain of galactic DNA
from the Clownacillus organism.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.611
Yes, I know that.
I could have told you that out on the lawn.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.081
But what does it mean?

08:04.150 --> 08:07.244
It's bacteria, Shake,
an ancient and rare bacteria.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.584
And the wig that Carl has is full of it.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.589
- Put that down.
- I'm listening.

08:11.657 --> 08:15.457
Just because I'm not looking at you
doesn't mean I'm not listening, Frylock.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.553
Okay, look. It makes the feet larger...

08:17.630 --> 08:20.497
discolors the hair, and splotches the skin.

08:20.566 --> 08:24.798
Symptoms include juggling,
riding a unicycle, and talking with a horn.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.738
Now, does that sound like
anything you know?

08:27.807 --> 08:30.605
- Sure, I will in a minute.
- Did you hear what I just said?

08:30.676 --> 08:35.272
I have to, because I get yelled at if I don't,
and then I'll get an "F."

08:36.215 --> 08:37.648
Don't go! Where are you going?

08:37.717 --> 08:39.446
Get away from me!
My God! You're a clown!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.317
I was just getting ready
to rock your world. What's going on?

08:42.388 --> 08:44.379
Carl, let her go. You're highly infectious.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.426
Carl, I'm afraid you've been clowned!

08:48.160 --> 08:50.651
Yeah, I thought my flip flops
felt a little tight.

08:50.730 --> 08:54.222
If you want me to help you, please
set those down. They're very expensive.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.497
I fricking can't. I need to do this.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.334
And the microscope.
Four, ladies and gentlemen!

09:00.406 --> 09:02.499
Put those down! Carl, it's your wig.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.974
We need to destroy that wig.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.274
No, we will not do that.
It gave me confidence and almost sex.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.109
Have you seen it lately, Carl?

09:09.181 --> 09:11.979
Yeah. Get rid of that.
Please get it off my head.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.145
Here we go. What the... Damn!

09:15.221 --> 09:16.654
God, that hurts!

09:16.722 --> 09:19.987
Hang on, Carl. I'll be right back.
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.754
I have no fricking idea what I'm doing.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.624
The flamethrower. I'll go get it.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.494
No, don't do that!
I like this Carl. He's funny!

09:26.566 --> 09:31.265
What we need to do is have us a fun party.
You know what I mean?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.929
Yes. We can rent him out for parties!

09:33.005 --> 09:34.973
- Can I go to the party?
- I don't know.

09:35.041 --> 09:38.204
- Can you afford Carlozo?
- Shut up, Shake. This is serious.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.677
You don't even know how to party.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.247
And five, ladies and...

09:45.751 --> 09:47.776
Use the time machine. That worked.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.014
That's what I said. Use the time machine.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.182
We don't have a time machine.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.060
I feel kind of funny. Like, ha-ha funny.

09:56.128 --> 09:59.097
My God, it's spreading
faster than I thought.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.425
Okay, that's it.

10:06.038 --> 10:09.337
What? We'll just freeze him
until I can figure out a cure.

10:10.209 --> 10:14.202
<i>Sixty-seven years into the future, bitch.</i>

10:26.993 --> 10:29.052
That coat rack just broke.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.427
- What is it? What?
- I said the coat rack broke!

10:34.934 --> 10:36.060
Chet?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.095
Ken?

10:38.971 --> 10:42.702
- What the hell was his name?
- Eat your own damn milk.

10:43.509 --> 10:44.635
Yeah.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.110
And that's how the wig works.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.713
You know. I mean, of course you know.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.628
Stop telling me to do things!
