WEBVTT

00:00.313 --> 00:01.982
Uncle Scrooge!
You're sick,

00:02.025 --> 00:03.026
you shouldn't be on your feet.

00:03.113 --> 00:04.580
I have to make
my morning meeting.

00:04.668 --> 00:06.812
A stuffy nose and
clogged ears won't kill me.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.359
Yeah, he's vanquished
mythical beasts,

00:09.447 --> 00:12.119
demonic armies,
robot uprisings!

00:12.221 --> 00:13.697
Which would probably
wear out

00:13.785 --> 00:16.123
someone half his
advanced age.

00:16.212 --> 00:17.954
Advanced age?!

00:21.619 --> 00:24.923
For the last time, I'm not sick!

00:31.923 --> 00:33.633
According to the
Junior Woodchuck Guidebook,

00:33.720 --> 00:35.014
your
sickness could be...

00:35.587 --> 00:36.634
Finally.

00:36.721 --> 00:40.611
A quick dip before my meeting
is all I need to vim my vigor.

00:44.285 --> 00:45.767
Ahh!

00:51.892 --> 00:54.361
I've been robbed!

01:52.391 --> 01:55.874
All right. I know you have this
insane competition with Scrooge.

01:55.962 --> 01:57.867
But we also run this
charity with him,

01:57.955 --> 02:00.775
so we have to look
respectable, focus...

02:01.271 --> 02:03.025
- Focus!
- What the...?!

02:03.344 --> 02:07.202
Wait... Listen, Owlson,
I know we've had our differences,

02:07.290 --> 02:10.304
but I'm very close to figuring
out the perfect scheme!

02:10.390 --> 02:12.720
I may have a way to make
more money than Scrooge,

02:12.808 --> 02:15.376
win the bet,
and take over his company.

02:15.481 --> 02:17.978
You're supposed to be smart,
maybe you can help.

02:18.066 --> 02:20.869
I just need
to figure out how...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.303
Ah-ah-ah! N.E.S.T.:

02:24.391 --> 02:27.009
No Elaborate
Schemes Today.

02:27.097 --> 02:28.420
- What about tonight?
- No.

02:28.508 --> 02:30.236
- Tomorrow?
- Still a "T".

02:30.351 --> 02:32.462
Well, at the very least
Tuesday!

02:32.550 --> 02:34.931
No! No more schemes!

02:35.061 --> 02:37.184
We run a multi-billion
dollar business.

02:37.271 --> 02:39.474
We can be a force
for good in this world,

02:39.561 --> 02:43.132
but not if you keep ruining
my... our... our reputation

02:43.220 --> 02:46.611
with your stupid,
obviously evil schemes.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.623
You want to beat
Scrooge, don't you?

02:49.891 --> 02:51.376
Yes, Ms. Owlson.

02:51.501 --> 02:54.894
Okay. Well to do that,
you need to be more like him:

02:54.981 --> 02:58.134
Poised, calm, respect...

02:58.221 --> 03:01.002
It was you!

03:01.635 --> 03:02.764
I know it was you!

03:02.851 --> 03:05.315
Admit what you did,
you cockamamie kleptomaniac!

03:05.432 --> 03:08.054
Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, of course, I did!

03:08.141 --> 03:09.344
Wait, what did I do?

03:09.431 --> 03:11.554
You stole money from my bin!

03:11.641 --> 03:13.264
He's been here
all morning.

03:13.351 --> 03:14.932
I have the stress headache
to prove it.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.344
That's impossible.

03:16.431 --> 03:18.094
I did binventory
just last night.

03:18.181 --> 03:19.282
It was all accounted for.

03:19.370 --> 03:21.804
Are you okay?
You seem a little, well...

03:21.891 --> 03:23.752
the opposite of sane.

03:25.849 --> 03:26.948
Manny!

03:28.101 --> 03:30.184
See these two out.

03:30.737 --> 03:32.440
Somebody broke into
this bin

03:32.528 --> 03:35.493
and stole from
Scrooge McDuck.

03:35.581 --> 03:37.357
Until I find out
who and how,

03:37.445 --> 03:39.211
only authorized
employees at the Bin.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.799
I'll need my top men.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.284
Follow me.

03:47.721 --> 03:50.184
The security system
is fully operational

03:50.271 --> 03:52.804
and primed to wreak
maximum havoc.

03:53.895 --> 03:56.183
If a thief had
entered this building,

03:56.271 --> 03:58.526
he'd have been caught
and placed in cold storage

03:58.614 --> 04:00.292
awaiting genetic
experimentation

04:00.380 --> 04:02.049
for Operation
Gyrobutapocalypse.

04:02.137 --> 04:03.362
It's all in the budget.

04:03.557 --> 04:05.633
- What?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

04:05.721 --> 04:08.018
Chicken soup?
Restorative nutrients!

04:08.106 --> 04:10.432
Get me Gizmoduck.

04:15.327 --> 04:17.512
Glomgold was
with Zan Owlson.

04:17.827 --> 04:20.053
Mark Beaks was live
posting at Crowchella,

04:20.141 --> 04:22.633
and the Beagles were at ConCon,
convict convention.

04:22.781 --> 04:24.157
What about Magica?

04:24.766 --> 04:25.930
Still no sign of her.

04:26.018 --> 04:27.157
Hmm...

04:28.250 --> 04:30.602
I get that
this is a big deal,

04:30.696 --> 04:33.375
but Scrooge is in no condition
to take on this stress right now.

04:33.463 --> 04:34.704
His nasal passages are

04:34.791 --> 04:36.010
dangerously clogged.

04:36.098 --> 04:37.297
You'd be concerned
too

04:37.385 --> 04:39.438
if your impenetrable
fortress were robbed.

04:39.526 --> 04:41.438
You know, I'm surprised
we haven't heard from...

04:41.766 --> 04:42.914
We've been robbed?!

04:43.002 --> 04:44.342
Oh, the humanity!

04:44.430 --> 04:45.822
Give it to me straight,
Uncle Scrooge,

04:45.909 --> 04:48.719
how much did I lose...
Uh, we... you lose?

04:49.188 --> 04:53.141
Eighty-seven cents.

04:54.181 --> 04:55.498
Sorry, did I miss
a part of that?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.094
Like $2 million
and 87 cents or...

04:58.181 --> 04:59.756
The amount
doesn't matter.

04:59.844 --> 05:00.992
What matters is,

05:01.080 --> 05:03.368
the bin has been
compromised.

05:03.499 --> 05:05.272
If it's only
a couple of coins,

05:05.360 --> 05:07.359
how could you possibly know
they're actually missing?

05:07.446 --> 05:09.756
Because Uncle Scrooge
knows every coin

05:09.844 --> 05:11.506
in there like the
feathers in his tail.

05:11.594 --> 05:13.184
Exactly Webbigail.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.305
That's how I stay smarter
than the smarties.

05:16.507 --> 05:18.571
Once that goes,
it's a slippery slope

05:18.659 --> 05:20.766
into being as smart
as the smarties

05:20.854 --> 05:22.307
and then...

05:22.569 --> 05:24.732
...slightly less smart
that the smarties!

05:24.851 --> 05:26.974
Uh, did you check
your pockets?

05:27.328 --> 05:29.446
Did I check my pockets?

05:29.534 --> 05:30.735
Ha!
Of course

05:30.823 --> 05:33.317
I checked my...
pockets...

05:33.703 --> 05:35.485
...and they're not
in my pockets!

05:35.573 --> 05:37.180
How can you be sure
they're even gone?

05:37.268 --> 05:38.633
You'd have to count
every coin

05:38.721 --> 05:39.758
in the bin
to prove it.

05:39.846 --> 05:41.516
And that would be crazy.

05:42.327 --> 05:44.610
Huey and his
stupid nerd brain.

05:44.933 --> 05:48.475
Four-hundred-and-fifty-five,
Four-hundred-and-fifty-six...

05:48.563 --> 05:50.936
I, for one, think there's
too much pressure on him.

05:51.024 --> 05:52.709
He needs a good
eight hours of sleep.

05:52.797 --> 05:54.547
Four hundred and f...
Uh...

05:54.965 --> 05:56.666
Oh, come on!

05:57.026 --> 05:59.842
One, two, three...

05:59.930 --> 06:02.328
Don't you think Uncle Scrooge
seems a bit... off?

06:05.008 --> 06:07.053
Hah!
He's never been more on.

06:07.141 --> 06:09.039
He's at the height
of his powers.

06:09.127 --> 06:10.719
He's losing his mind!

06:10.807 --> 06:12.437
Let me look at the symptoms in
the Junior Woodchuck Guide...

06:12.524 --> 06:14.899
Aah! Where's my
Junior Woodchuck Guidebook?!

06:17.274 --> 06:19.086
Phew!
Must have fallen out.

06:19.207 --> 06:20.914
Weird. Ah!

06:21.100 --> 06:22.973
- What? - What? - What?
- Gold fever.

06:23.061 --> 06:26.453
"A serious condition caused by
prolonged exposure to gold.

06:26.541 --> 06:28.791
Symptoms include
confusion...

06:30.199 --> 06:31.715
itchiness...

06:32.832 --> 06:33.923
paranoia..."

06:34.011 --> 06:35.698
I will find you!
Nobody gets away with this!

06:35.785 --> 06:38.264
"...and going to
outlandish extremes."

06:38.351 --> 06:40.144
It may be fatal!

06:41.896 --> 06:43.347
Last week he bought
a country

06:43.435 --> 06:44.886
to save
on foreign postage.

06:44.974 --> 06:46.144
That's just Scrooge.

06:46.232 --> 06:47.300
Nothing is weird.

06:47.388 --> 06:48.885
This is Scrooge McDuck,

06:48.972 --> 06:50.939
the bin is
on total lockdown.

06:51.027 --> 06:52.822
All non-security personnel

06:52.910 --> 06:55.668
are hereby banished
from the premises.

06:57.101 --> 06:58.441
Good day.

06:59.269 --> 07:03.136
Okay, this might be a little
out of the ordinary.

07:04.639 --> 07:06.207
Hello, Duckburg.

07:06.305 --> 07:09.178
By now you know that
my precious wee ones

07:09.266 --> 07:11.179
were kidnapped
this morning.

07:11.394 --> 07:13.082
Here is a recent picture.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.465
Two quarters,
two dimes,

07:15.563 --> 07:17.476
a spry gang of nickels,

07:17.727 --> 07:19.867
and a couple of scared
little pennies.

07:20.058 --> 07:21.968
Coins, if you're watching...

07:22.216 --> 07:23.929
I miss you very much.

07:24.871 --> 07:27.218
What? Scrooge loves money?

07:27.313 --> 07:30.647
How weirdly uncharacteristic
of him. Please.

07:30.771 --> 07:32.224
Shhh. This is important.

07:32.311 --> 07:34.684
We have to protect every
remaining coin in the bin.

07:34.929 --> 07:38.742
This is what waits for the
heartless monster that took them.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.468
A ransom? Oh, no.

07:42.695 --> 07:46.093
A bounty on the foul head
of the coin-napper.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.687
Two million dollars!

07:48.890 --> 07:52.476
Ooof, yep, he's got Gold Fever.
He has to be stopped.

08:00.601 --> 08:03.031
So what's the plan for
capturing the intruder?

08:03.119 --> 08:04.835
Rope slings?
Trip wires?

08:05.030 --> 08:06.755
Oh, no, no, no.

08:06.843 --> 08:08.851
No, none of that
will be necessary.

08:08.939 --> 08:12.617
Because I have a full arsenal
at the ready!

08:13.734 --> 08:17.234
I'd like to see you try
to get in now, Chester!

08:17.322 --> 08:19.937
Hey, Uncle Scrooge,
this is all great.

08:20.025 --> 08:21.515
Looks like everything's
taken care of

08:21.603 --> 08:23.812
so, you can go home and
get some rest, huh?

08:24.049 --> 08:27.512
What part of "I shall not rest"
do you not understand?

08:27.677 --> 08:28.840
Hyah!

08:29.452 --> 08:31.531
You cannae be
too careful.

08:33.756 --> 08:36.089
The Faceless Fiend
struck again.

08:36.177 --> 08:38.500
He stole
my spats!

08:38.587 --> 08:39.861
But I made new ones out of those

08:39.948 --> 08:41.561
tissue boxes you left me, lad.

08:42.865 --> 08:46.812
Who's the
sick one now, Chester?!

08:47.696 --> 08:49.734
Who is... "Chester," was it?

08:49.827 --> 08:52.585
He's the unknown.
He's the question.

08:52.673 --> 08:55.327
- There he is!
- I'll get him!

08:55.415 --> 08:57.538
Gizmoduck! Fire!

08:59.974 --> 09:01.097
I don't see anything.

09:01.185 --> 09:03.738
Hurry, attack,
before he gets away!

09:03.826 --> 09:04.943
That's an order!

09:05.031 --> 09:07.824
Um, engage Midriff Missiles.

09:07.912 --> 09:10.663
No, he's not of sound mind!
Don't fire!

09:10.804 --> 09:12.434
My mind is perfectly sound!

09:12.521 --> 09:14.234
Blow it all to pieces!

09:24.391 --> 09:27.273
Ahh! Smoke? I haven't even
hit the ground yet!

09:27.361 --> 09:29.611
I'll handle this!

09:31.271 --> 09:32.634
I'll handle this...

09:32.721 --> 09:34.202
My Helmetcopter's stuck!

09:34.290 --> 09:36.438
Will someone else
handle this!

09:37.443 --> 09:39.171
- Dewey!
- Oh, no!

09:39.259 --> 09:41.092
It's every nightmare
I've ever had!

09:41.180 --> 09:42.654
Blathering Blatherskite!

09:43.397 --> 09:45.391
Dewey!

09:56.506 --> 09:58.205
Authorities are already
calling

09:58.294 --> 10:00.413
the disaster
"Bridgemageddon."

10:00.554 --> 10:02.843
And the rampant
chaos was needlessly

10:02.931 --> 10:05.475
caused by Scrooge McDuck
himself.

10:05.641 --> 10:09.466
McDuck's increasingly erratic
behavior has driven investors

10:09.554 --> 10:12.350
to pull their money from his
company and give it to safer,

10:12.438 --> 10:14.231
more stable businesses like...

10:14.319 --> 10:17.647
Okay, this can't be right.
Glomgold Industries?

10:17.757 --> 10:19.950
I didn't think
it was possible but...

10:20.038 --> 10:22.263
Ha! Hear that, McDuck?!

10:22.351 --> 10:25.616
I'm more stable than you are!

10:25.788 --> 10:27.046
Debateable.

10:27.374 --> 10:30.265
He must be there somewhere,
the swindling swine.

10:31.601 --> 10:33.288
Mr. McDuck, there's been
a break-in!

10:34.493 --> 10:36.933
Now I have you, Chester,
you thieving...!

10:37.021 --> 10:38.046
Oh...

10:39.350 --> 10:41.452
Uncle Scrooge,
we need to talk.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.013
I'll start. "Dear Mr. McDee,

10:45.101 --> 10:46.919
they say it's not
the years in your life,

10:47.007 --> 10:49.669
but the life in your years."
Happy birthday!

10:49.757 --> 10:52.302
Gimme that. What Launchpad
means to say is,

10:52.390 --> 10:53.913
we're all really
worried about you.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.427
Some of us are just here
to see you

10:55.515 --> 10:56.975
triumphantly
capture the thief.

10:57.085 --> 10:58.264
You have to
face the truth.

10:58.351 --> 11:00.288
No one stole
87 cents from you.

11:00.388 --> 11:03.511
You have gold fever
and you're very, very sick.

11:03.614 --> 11:06.202
Any more exposure to gold
could kill you.

11:06.975 --> 11:08.441
Don't worry, Scrooge.

11:08.561 --> 11:10.304
Dewey and I
believe in you.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.153
There's something
about your uncle

11:12.241 --> 11:13.388
firing missiles
and a plane at you

11:13.475 --> 11:15.724
- that sort of changes your mind.
- Dewey!

11:15.928 --> 11:18.035
This is about saving Scrooge's life,

11:18.123 --> 11:19.600
not choosing sides.

11:26.536 --> 11:29.399
E tu, Headless Man-Horse?

11:29.487 --> 11:30.803
Well, forget all of you!

11:30.891 --> 11:32.129
If you don't want to help me

11:32.217 --> 11:34.068
find the intruder,
then I don't need you,

11:34.156 --> 11:35.640
you bunch of traitors!

11:36.483 --> 11:40.631
There's a perfectly simple
explanation for all of this.

11:43.484 --> 11:46.593
It's all Chester,
the inter-dimensional imp!

11:46.681 --> 11:50.428
He prances in and out of
reality, attacking me bit by bit.

11:50.571 --> 11:53.311
First the sneaky scoundrel
licked everything

11:53.399 --> 11:55.491
in my office,
and stole my spats!

11:55.717 --> 11:58.514
Then he nabbed my 87 cents.

11:58.662 --> 12:00.733
You think you have
everyone fooled,

12:00.821 --> 12:04.093
but, oh no, not me,
I'm onto you!

12:06.805 --> 12:08.718
Look at all the weight
you've lost.

12:08.806 --> 12:10.574
Your clothes don't even fit.

12:10.662 --> 12:12.129
That's Chester!

12:12.217 --> 12:15.681
He dances in my clothes while I
sleep and stretches them all out!

12:17.250 --> 12:21.223
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it is all... Chester.

12:21.311 --> 12:23.326
But maybe you should
listen to Huey,

12:23.414 --> 12:25.944
step away from the gold
and get some rest,

12:26.032 --> 12:27.967
just in case you're wrong?

12:32.014 --> 12:36.053
No. I'll prove it to you.
I'll count the money myself!

12:36.931 --> 12:38.473
Please, Uncle Scrooge!

12:38.561 --> 12:40.170
If you jump into that gold,

12:40.295 --> 12:41.896
you could die!

12:42.693 --> 12:43.795
Stop this!

12:43.883 --> 12:45.395
Maybe you're both right?

12:45.483 --> 12:48.514
No. Because I know
I'm not crazy!

12:48.602 --> 12:50.281
Out of my way.

12:55.969 --> 12:57.086
Ah!

13:00.231 --> 13:02.983
No, Mr. McDee,
not on your birthday!

13:13.100 --> 13:17.639
Nobody keeps me
from my gold!

13:23.347 --> 13:25.340
In shocking market news,

13:25.428 --> 13:28.795
Glomgold Industries rises
to the top of the stock index,

13:28.891 --> 13:32.725
making Flintheart Glomgold
the richest duck in the world.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.263
Congratulations,
Flintheart.

13:36.351 --> 13:40.420
I've literally never been more
surprised by anything in my life.

13:41.103 --> 13:42.592
Thank you, Owlson.

13:42.871 --> 13:44.803
I cannae wait to shove this

13:44.891 --> 13:47.545
in McDuck's smug face!

13:49.256 --> 13:50.394
This just in.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.045
Scrooge McDuck has
apparently...

13:53.251 --> 13:55.374
died of gold fever.

13:55.499 --> 13:57.042
Huh?

13:59.502 --> 14:01.075
Oh, no!

14:01.382 --> 14:03.593
He was too young!

14:03.803 --> 14:05.562
Oh, no!

14:06.039 --> 14:08.578
Engage Bagpipes.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.724
<i>♪ All I do is win, win, win
No matter what ♪</i>

14:18.811 --> 14:22.094
<i>♪ I got money on my mind

I win!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.123
Huh?

14:44.749 --> 14:47.703
I'm so very sorry.
I'm so...

14:48.382 --> 14:51.710
Owlson! Help me up onto his
casket so I can dance on it!

14:54.819 --> 14:56.224
We'll be
taking our seats.

14:56.311 --> 14:59.022
Oh, fine, I'll sit down
so you can mourn...

14:59.110 --> 15:01.523
the second richest duck
in the world.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.982
And I beat him,
fair and square!

15:07.719 --> 15:10.514
Well, technically, no, you didn't.
Gold Fever did.

15:10.602 --> 15:13.805
But, again, this is a wildly
inappropriate time to discuss it.

15:14.944 --> 15:16.490
Ohh!

15:22.061 --> 15:24.184
Uncle Scrooge taught us
all so much.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.881
But perhaps the most
important thing

15:25.990 --> 15:29.115
was the importance of
listening to your family.

15:29.234 --> 15:30.857
After he... passed,

15:30.975 --> 15:33.068
we decided that it would
only be fair to his memory

15:33.156 --> 15:35.689
to at least consider
his theory.

15:35.777 --> 15:37.820
If this hypothetical thief
were real,

15:37.908 --> 15:39.949
he would have to have been
a master genius.

15:40.037 --> 15:43.436
It would have to have been a
scheme so elaborate and so complex

15:43.524 --> 15:46.686
some might even call it...
the perfect scheme!

15:46.967 --> 15:50.264
Was this indeed
a master criminal genius?

15:50.467 --> 15:52.764
In the end, the sad truth is,

15:52.851 --> 15:55.326
there could never be
any master villain

15:55.414 --> 15:58.801
capable of pulling off
such a genius scheme.

16:01.106 --> 16:04.309
Scrooge died of gold fever.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.908
No! It was me!

16:05.996 --> 16:09.725
I did it! I'm the evil genius!
It was me!

16:09.813 --> 16:13.123
And my... Time Teaser.

16:13.211 --> 16:14.678
Greatest scheme ever!

16:14.766 --> 16:16.469
In your face, Owlson!

16:16.557 --> 16:19.238
Dead Scrooge,
mourning family,

16:19.326 --> 16:21.381
I'm the richest duck
in the world

16:21.469 --> 16:24.264
and here's how I did it!

16:27.842 --> 16:30.951
For the last time, I'm not sick!

16:37.576 --> 16:38.934
Hmm...

16:39.279 --> 16:43.365
All right. I know you have this
insane competition with Scrooge...

16:45.684 --> 16:47.547
Ha-ha. I get it.

16:47.635 --> 16:49.305
You're ignoring me.

16:50.681 --> 16:52.670
Owlson?
Owlson!

16:52.758 --> 16:54.014
Hello?!

17:22.808 --> 17:24.881
Why aren't you moving?!

17:25.347 --> 17:26.730
Is this some kind of game?!

17:26.818 --> 17:28.754
Answer me, baby!

17:41.929 --> 17:44.343
Your will is strong, baby.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.328
You remind me of a young me.

17:57.101 --> 17:59.226
But we also run this
charity with him,

17:59.314 --> 18:02.187
so we have to look
respectable, focus...

18:02.641 --> 18:04.585
- Focus!
- What the...?

18:07.662 --> 18:10.421
And having mastered
space and time,

18:10.509 --> 18:15.039
I immediately enacted my scheme
to rob Scrooge blind!

18:27.555 --> 18:28.469
Ahh!

18:37.181 --> 18:38.429
Ahh!

18:47.221 --> 18:50.250
But I realized,
why take it all

18:50.429 --> 18:54.773
when a little
would drive him insane!

18:54.974 --> 18:58.125
Whose schemes
sound crazy now?!

18:58.219 --> 18:59.652
This one still does.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.903
But you haven't heard it all!

19:02.146 --> 19:04.640
I know what you did, you
cockamamie kleptomaniac!

19:04.728 --> 19:05.734
Are you okay?

19:05.822 --> 19:09.054
You seem a little,
well, the opposite of sane.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.732
There he is!

20:03.000 --> 20:06.391
What? You're alive
as a horse?!

20:10.430 --> 20:12.758
Yes, of course
I'm alive, you idiot.

20:12.851 --> 20:16.461
I took my own advice
and listened to my family.

20:25.829 --> 20:28.485
Okay, maybe
I am a wee bit sick.

20:28.578 --> 20:30.602
But maybe
you're not crazy.

20:32.271 --> 20:33.477
I rested for a day.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.752
Then we put our heads
together

20:34.840 --> 20:36.001
and realized
this was obviously

20:36.088 --> 20:38.381
all your idiotic scheme
to win the bet.

20:38.469 --> 20:40.008
You were "Chester"!

20:40.165 --> 20:42.030
So we staged the
funeral to get you

20:42.118 --> 20:43.394
to admit that
you committed fraud.

20:43.481 --> 20:47.224
Legally making me the richest
duck in the world again.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.790
Thank you.

20:50.235 --> 20:51.618
You're alive?!

20:51.706 --> 20:53.199
You're alive!

20:55.024 --> 20:57.304
- You forgot to tell Donald?
- Whoops.

20:57.594 --> 20:59.649
See, you could never
beat me, Flinty,

20:59.737 --> 21:02.500
because I have my family
to keep me grounded.

21:02.797 --> 21:04.649
Also, I'm Scrooge McDuck

21:04.737 --> 21:07.190
and I'm even better
at being crazy than you.

21:15.981 --> 21:18.058
They must have reversed
the Time Teaser.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.032
What do you do
the next time

21:23.120 --> 21:24.776
your uncle goes mad
with suspicion?

21:24.864 --> 21:26.647
Call Mrs. Beakley.

21:26.749 --> 21:28.419
Fake Scrooge's death.

21:37.065 --> 21:38.690
Thank you, Beakley!

21:38.889 --> 21:41.198
Don't mention it.
Really.

21:56.141 --> 21:58.039
See you tomorrow, Flinty.
