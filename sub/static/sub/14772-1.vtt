Brooke, we're all
upset, but we need to move on.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.840
Honey, you're a junior now.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.687
It's your make-or-break year,
so there's no room for self pity.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.408
Can you give Marlene and I
a ride to school today?

03:54.520 --> 03:56.204
I'm sorry, honey,
I don't have time.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.641
I have an 8:30 with Marc Shelley
at White & Wolfe.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.256
What?! Richard, you didn't say anything!

04:00.280 --> 04:02.282
How did you get the meeting?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.368
It's just a meeting,
so don't get too excited.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.926
But it could be huge.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.326
I know!

04:08.440 --> 04:09.736
Who's going to the meeting with you?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.489
Hey, I got the meeting.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.444
I know, I just think maybe you
should take Melinda or Janice.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.449
Janice?
You want me to take Janice?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.403
- Yeah, why not?
- I'm not taking Janice.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.046
- Rough morning?
- You know my parents.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.845
Maybe they just need a little more time.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.123
I don't know about that.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.641
I'd say they're pretty over it.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.411
My mom's making tacos tonight.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.329
I'll let her know you're coming.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.329
It's not like they'll miss me.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.124
Brooke, I'm serious, honey.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.163
You need to get focused or you could say,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.045
"Good-bye Stanford,
hello Somewhere State."

04:43.160 --> 04:44.730
Got it.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.091
Yikes.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.571
Good morning!

04:52.680 --> 04:53.966
Morning, Grace.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.200
I keep telling you, you
don't have to keep doing this.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.645
Are you kidding?

04:57.760 --> 04:59.649
This is the best part of my day, Gramps.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.762
Pills first.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.885
You're a good girl.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.970
Ah, honey, you know I'm not
gonna be around here forever,

05:09.120 --> 05:12.761
and you might wanna start
thinking about some other guy

05:12.880 --> 05:16.009
you wanna have breakfast with.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.804
I'll work on that.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.201
Okay.

05:20.320 --> 05:25.091
You know, I love the way you do
the oatmeal, but what do you say

05:25.200 --> 05:28.329
I take you out for bacon and
eggs this morning, my treat.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.841
Not after your
last cholesterol test.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.721
Besides, I have some papers I have
to grade before the staff meeting.

05:33.840 --> 05:38.801
I'm 81 years old, and bacon
is not gonna be what kills me.

05:38.920 --> 05:43.005
Nice try, you're 82.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.011
Yeah.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.525
Good morning.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.926
Have a nice day.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.366
Morning, ladies.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.766
Morning.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.121
Good morning.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.129
Hey, what do you call
a teacher with no students?

06:04.240 --> 06:05.480
Unemployed.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.728
I got it, how about ecstatic?

06:07.840 --> 06:10.081
You're both right. Retired!

06:10.200 --> 06:12.362
Only 36 days to go!

06:12.480 --> 06:15.205
You know you're gonna miss
the kids when you're gone, Rizzo.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.891
No, Grace. That's sweet, but no, I won't.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.050
The older I get, the more difficult
these kids are to deal with.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.650
I totally agree.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.016
Yesterday, I just about
snatched at Tim Webster.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.644
That boy had me on my last nerve.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.570
Well, I happen to think that difficult
students can be a blessing.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.402
Grace, honey, when is this
optimism ever gonna wear off?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.004
Bill. Bill.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.485
Bill.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.571
Junk mail.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.166
Oh, man!

06:49.280 --> 06:52.204
David, why are you always so sad?

06:52.320 --> 06:55.449
Hey! You're back!

06:55.600 --> 06:56.931
Why are you back?

06:57.040 --> 07:00.209
My pastor gave me permission
to finish my doctorate at Hadleigh,

07:00.320 --> 07:05.565
so if that's okay with you,
I'm gonna be here for awhile.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.887
Oh, David, you are a mess.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.331
What happened to you?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.408
I woke up.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.165
Okay, for 500 points,
for all the cheese, for the game.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.124
This quote is from what document?

07:20.240 --> 07:23.326
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal,

07:23.440 --> 07:25.010
"that they are endowed by their Creator

07:25.120 --> 07:26.616
with certain unalienable
rights, that among these..."

07:26.640 --> 07:28.927
Boom, baby!

07:29.040 --> 07:30.849
All right, Team 1, what's your answer?

07:30.960 --> 07:34.203
Our answer is
the Declaration of Independence.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.721
That's... correct!

07:36.840 --> 07:38.251
Team 1 wins!

07:38.360 --> 07:40.681
Yes!

07:40.800 --> 07:43.041
Okay, you guys,

07:43.160 --> 07:46.605
Monday we will examine the assertion of
individual rights through the last century.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.007
Have a good weekend.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.809
Brooke, are you okay?

07:55.920 --> 07:58.287
I'm fine.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.209
Are you sure?

08:00.320 --> 08:03.051
Yeah, thanks.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.927
Ms. Ryan?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.806
I lied.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.165
Are you sure you're being fair?

08:48.280 --> 08:53.086
Trust me, they're over it,
and they expect me to be over it, too.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.443
It's like to them, he never even existed.

08:56.560 --> 09:01.847
The only thing that I know for sure is that
I'm never going to see my brother again.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.531
Everybody's asked if there's
anything that they can do.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.964
The truth is, no one can do anything
because the only thing that I really want

09:08.080 --> 09:12.650
is 5 more minutes to tell my brother
how I really felt about him.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.401
Did your brother believe
there was something more?

09:16.520 --> 09:18.409
I don't know.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.889
Do you?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.816
Brooke, every person
reaches a point in their life

09:24.840 --> 09:27.002
when they ask themselves this question.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.044
There's nothing wrong
with you asking it, too.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.643
You never let anything get to you.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.768
How do you do that?

09:40.320 --> 09:42.084
Jesus.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.324
Hello?

10:04.440 --> 10:05.726
How'd it go, Amy?

10:05.840 --> 10:08.525
Michael.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.849
It's gone.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.169
My cancer's... it's gone.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.931
Oh, my goodness!

10:18.040 --> 10:19.530
That's incredible!

10:19.680 --> 10:25.289
I know. I just... I can't believe it.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.765
Isn't that what you prayed for?

10:26.880 --> 10:31.442
Yes, of course. I just...

10:31.560 --> 10:34.450
Prayer is a powerful thing,

10:34.560 --> 10:38.963
and it turns out God has
much bigger plans for you.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.843
You okay, Grace?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.049
Yeah, I just can't
stop thinking about Brooke.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.889
You know, she's searching.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.490
She's hurting.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.491
Yeah,
that's the thing about atheism.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.208
It doesn't take away the pain;
It just takes away the hope.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.243
What'd you tell her?

11:08.360 --> 11:09.725
The truth.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.127
Now she's free to make her own choice.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.129
Unfortunately, in this day and age,

11:14.240 --> 11:19.087
people seem to forget that the
most basic human right of all

11:19.240 --> 11:21.527
is a right to know Jesus.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.290
Let's put her on the prayer list.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.529
Prayer always seems to be
the last thing we do,

11:26.640 --> 11:29.928
when it should be the first.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.162
Now, how 'bout some more popcorn?

11:32.280 --> 11:35.568
With a glycemic index
of 100, not a chance.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.887
I swear, Grace, if you
don't start feeding me better,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.846
I'm gonna leave you for a nursing home.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.281
Well, that's it for me.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.528
I'm going to bed.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.920
Love ya.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.690
I love you better.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.848
Love you first.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.246
That's unfair.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.050
Gotcha!

12:01.960 --> 12:04.691
Brooke, the people from
that charity place are here

12:04.800 --> 12:06.131
to pick up your brother's things.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.403
Can you make sure they get everything?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.171
And don't forget to put the milk away!

13:36.960 --> 13:41.568
- Well, that's the last of it.
- Thank you.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.047
And, well, I was loading one
of the boxes onto the truck,

13:44.160 --> 13:48.882
I noticed this and I thought
you might wanna keep it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.207
So sorry for your loss.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.921
And so, peaceful nonviolence
comes first in India under Gandhi,

14:39.040 --> 14:41.216
and then later, here in
the United States under Dr. King

14:41.240 --> 14:44.210
and others as a means
of achieving civil rights.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.443
But what makes nonviolence so radical

14:47.560 --> 14:50.450
is its unwavering commitment
to a nonviolent approach,

14:50.560 --> 14:53.803
not just initially, but in the
face of escalating persecution

14:53.920 --> 14:56.605
by the opposing force.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.891
Yes?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.616
Isn't that sort of like what Jesus meant

15:00.640 --> 15:04.281
when he said that we
should love our enemies?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.285
Yes.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.562
The writer of the Gospel of Matthew

15:10.720 --> 15:13.451
records Jesus as saying,
"You have heard it said,

15:13.600 --> 15:16.046
"love your neighbor and hate your enemy,

15:16.160 --> 15:19.050
"but I tell you, love your enemies

15:19.160 --> 15:21.845
"and pray for those who persecute you,

15:21.960 --> 15:25.169
that you will be children
of your Father in heaven,"

15:25.320 --> 15:28.449
which indicates a commitment
to nonviolence.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.763
Dr. King confirmed the link,
describing his inspiration from Scripture,

15:31.880 --> 15:35.566
saying Christ furnished
the spirit and motivation,

15:35.680 --> 15:37.762
while Gandhi furnished the method.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.211
Except that that didn't work.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.483
Jesus got himself killed
and everybody knows that.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.490
Well, so did Dr. King.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.049
So, I guess it just depends
on how you measure success.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.176
Both men created movements
that survive to this day,

15:52.200 --> 15:56.445
even though both paid the ultimate price
for their commitment to their ideals.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.681
I still wouldn't do it.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.529
Well, not very many people
have that kind of courage.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.803
But I, for one,
am grateful for those that do,

16:04.920 --> 16:09.642
you know, those who stand up
for what they believe.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.570
Have a good day.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.645
Are you Pastor Dave?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.131
I am.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.050
- I'm Martin Yip.
- Nice to meet you.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.288
My friend Josh Wheaton
said you might be able

16:39.400 --> 16:41.880
to answer my questions about God.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.049
Well, that definitely falls
within my job description.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.966
How many questions have you got?

16:49.080 --> 16:53.608
So far, 147.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.245
Is something wrong?

16:55.360 --> 16:56.646
No.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.616
Josh encouraged me to write them down
and be as comprehensive as possible.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.210
Of course he did.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.136
Well, I'll have to thank him
next time I see him.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.366
Come on.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.720
So, what's your first question?

17:07.680 --> 17:11.526
Grace,
I just have to hear it from you.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.404
Did this happen?

17:13.520 --> 17:17.804
If you're asking whether I responded
to a student's question, yes.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.208
If you're asking whether
her question and my answer

17:21.319 --> 17:23.846
both referenced Jesus as it was
relevant to the history lesson

17:23.960 --> 17:28.761
we were discussing,
again, I'd have to say yes.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.286
Good afternoon, Ms. Wesley.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.210
I've asked Bob Fessler to sit in,
he's the school's attorney,

17:42.320 --> 17:47.247
to advise us on any legal issues
we might be brushing up against.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.805
Should I have a lawyer, too?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.724
No, I don't see the need for that.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.920
Ms. Rizzo is present
as your union representation.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.610
Okay.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.650
We are here to hear
your side of the story.

18:00.760 --> 18:06.164
Now, I understand a student in
your second period history class

18:06.280 --> 18:10.286
asked a question about the parallels
between the teachings of Gandhi

18:10.440 --> 18:13.808
and remarks allegedly made by Jesus.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.968
Yes, that's correct.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.449
And your answer incorporated
specific detailed reference

18:20.560 --> 18:24.690
to those teachings that
included Scripture itself,

18:24.800 --> 18:28.009
the words of Jesus.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.929
Yes.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.929
What were you thinking, Grace?

18:32.040 --> 18:37.168
Do you believe your response
was in line with district policy?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.089
Yes.

18:39.200 --> 18:44.206
As well as in compliance
with state and federal guidelines?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.084
Yes, sir.

18:46.200 --> 18:51.525
Well, Ms. Wesley,
unfortunately for you,

18:51.640 --> 18:57.090
I'm fairly certain the
school board will disagree.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.767
No, Coach,
you're not hearing me.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.486
No prayers.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.365
No moments of silence. Nothing.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.403
It's tradition on the field.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.405
Not on the field, not in the locker room,
not in the parking lot for that matter.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.407
Whatever you say.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.646
Okay, thanks, Coach.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.165
Come on in.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.566
Hi, Brooke.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.728
You wanted to see me?

19:20.840 --> 19:24.208
Ms. Wesley is currently
under disciplinary review.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.569
All of her classes have been
reassigned until things are settled.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.603
I don't want you to have
any contact with her.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.724
None whatsoever, either
on or off school property.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.649
Do I have any say in this?

19:34.760 --> 19:39.408
No, I've already discussed things
with your father and he agrees.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.490
Since when does my dad care?

19:42.600 --> 19:45.496
Brooke, the important thing for you to
remember is you've done nothing wrong.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.601
Neither did Ms. Wesley.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.290
All she did was answer a question.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.016
Ms. Wesley's answer was
not in line with school policy.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.530
Really?

19:51.640 --> 19:53.456
I mean, aren't we allowed
to say what we believe?

19:53.480 --> 19:54.527
When did that change?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.369
I'm not gonna argue with you,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.456
and I don't want you discussing
the situation with anyone.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.891
Do you understand?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.928
Do you understand?

20:05.720 --> 20:08.610
Yes.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.049
Grace?

20:24.200 --> 20:25.486
Are you...

20:25.600 --> 20:28.206
Tom Endler, your union-appointed attorney.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.765
You don't look like a lawyer.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.484
Thank you.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.443
I'm not sure I meant that as a compliment.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.085
I'm determined to take it as one.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.044
Shall we sit?

20:40.200 --> 20:44.444
So, have you defended many teachers
in disciplinary matters?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.164
Nope, you're my first.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.487
Just hired on from
the public defender's office.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.130
Criminal law?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.208
No offense, but I'm not a criminal.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.651
Don't be so sure of that.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.728
Your kind of case makes
everybody uncomfortable.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.207
School boards, teachers, parents.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.170
It makes them feel... yucky.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.606
Yucky?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.371
Is that a technical legal term?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.482
You got a better word for it?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.001
Grace, I'm gonna level with you.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.685
Nobody wants your case.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.007
I drew it because
I'm low man on the totem pole

21:14.120 --> 21:16.009
in a place where
seniority means everything.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.169
If, for whatever reason,
you're not happy with me,

21:19.280 --> 21:21.009
you're on your own.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.408
You're free to hire your own
attorney out of your own pocket.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.888
Educational law isn't
exactly a common specialty.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.002
So, what's the good news?

21:30.120 --> 21:32.009
I don't like to lose.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.522
And I'm willing to fight for you.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.165
Are you a believer?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.806
You mean a Christian?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.161
No, but I think that's an advantage.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.765
Why?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.016
You're passionate about what you believe.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.529
I mean, let's face it, it's why
you're in trouble in the first place.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.362
But it blinds you to
the realities of procedure.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.681
Okay.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.131
Okay, what?

21:59.240 --> 22:01.447
Okay, I agree to let you represent me.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.530
- Good.
- Good.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.969
David, are you okay?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.082
Um, terrific.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.249
There was a young man
in here, brilliant kid,

22:17.360 --> 22:21.285
with no exposure to Scripture
until a few months ago.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.762
He came in with some questions.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.327
147 of 'em to be exact.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.922
I feel like I've been hit
by a truck loaded with Bibles.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.362
Big heavy ones with those thick covers.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.121
Always be ready to give
answer as to why you believe

22:40.240 --> 22:43.449
and the reason for your hope.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.848
1 Peter chapter 3, verse 15.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.291
Yes.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.244
And where were you 4 hours ago?

22:53.240 --> 22:55.720
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

22:55.840 --> 22:59.049
"and lean not on your own understanding.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.640
"In all your ways, acknowledge him

23:01.760 --> 23:05.765
and he will make your paths straight."

23:15.760 --> 23:19.048
Father, I need you.

23:19.160 --> 23:24.564
I can't do this alone.

23:24.680 --> 23:29.971
I know that you're in control.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.688
Please, give me the courage.

23:37.800 --> 23:42.249
In Jesus' name, amen.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.891
Call to order.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.129
I assume Ms. Wesley understands
that this board has the power

23:55.240 --> 23:58.244
to recommend any number
of disciplinary actions,

23:58.360 --> 24:01.011
up to and including termination.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.565
She does.

24:02.680 --> 24:06.050
And this board should be aware
that in the event of such termination,

24:06.160 --> 24:08.322
which we would view as both
wrongful and without cause,

24:08.440 --> 24:09.965
she reserves all rights of redress.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.367
I may have a solution.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.087
There might be a way around
all of this unpleasantness

24:16.200 --> 24:18.407
that would satisfy all parties.

24:18.560 --> 24:22.406
A disciplinary notice in Ms. Wesley's file

24:22.560 --> 24:26.963
stating the school board's
objections to her behavior,

24:27.080 --> 24:29.890
a response from Ms. Wesley

24:30.000 --> 24:32.731
confessing the inappropriateness of

24:32.840 --> 24:36.322
and apologizing for her actions,

24:36.440 --> 24:39.171
along with a pledge not to engage

24:39.280 --> 24:44.241
in similar discussion
of Jesus in the future.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.336
I'm confident that we can
move forward on that basis.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.567
No.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.445
Grace...

24:51.560 --> 24:52.891
I can't.

24:57.160 --> 25:01.008
I'd like to request a brief recess
to have a word with my client.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.770
Excuse me.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.843
Grace, this is exactly
what we were hoping for.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.524
I mean, this is the part where you
say you're sorry, thank your lawyer,

25:11.640 --> 25:15.884
go back to your classroom,
pick up your life, and move on.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.846
- I can't do that.
- Why?

25:19.960 --> 25:23.409
I gave an honest answer to a student's
legitimate question in history.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.965
Grace.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.004
Grace, you don't wanna do this.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.682
It's the wrong decision.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.968
Is it?

25:35.080 --> 25:38.004
I mean, I would rather stand with God

25:38.120 --> 25:40.282
and be judged by the world

25:40.400 --> 25:45.201
than stand with the world
and be judged by God.

25:47.320 --> 25:51.325
I am not gonna be afraid
to say the name "Jesus."

26:01.560 --> 26:03.289
I know her. She's not gonna go for it.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.802
How do we make this go away
and not get blood on our hands?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.928
That's the easy part.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.327
We let the ACLU do it.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.125
They'll file suit against Ms. Wesley

26:14.240 --> 26:17.961
and if she is found liable,
which she will be,

26:18.080 --> 26:19.889
then we fire her for cause.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.604
But the school district will certainly
be named as a codefendant.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.121
We don't have the financial
wherewithal to fight that.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.049
They've already been in touch.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.970
They aren't interested
in punishing the school.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.367
They want her.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.766
Are you sure?

26:34.880 --> 26:36.245
Trust me.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.967
They've been dreaming of a case like this.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.371
While Ms. Wesley apologizes
for any inconvenience

26:52.480 --> 26:55.165
her actions may have caused,

26:55.280 --> 26:59.164
Ms. Wesley stands by her statements,
and she does not retract or recant them,

26:59.280 --> 27:05.049
either in full or in part.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.004
So noted.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.722
Having little choice, this board
recommends continued suspension,

27:15.840 --> 27:18.411
henceforth without pay,

27:18.520 --> 27:21.046
pending review by a court
of competent jurisdiction

27:21.200 --> 27:23.282
to determine whether or not
Ms. Wesley violated

27:23.400 --> 27:27.405
local, state, or federal guidelines.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.761
This proceeding is adjourned.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.246
The last thing we need
is a bunch of religious fanatics

27:46.360 --> 27:47.930
protesting outside of our house.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.202
We'll work to keep it
out of the media for now.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.051
But next year, when you're
applying to all the colleges,

27:53.160 --> 27:54.844
you'll be able to tell the story

27:54.960 --> 27:57.804
of how Brooke was part of
a landmark constitutional case

27:57.920 --> 28:00.730
concerning the separation
of church and state.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.481
And believe me, there is not
an Ivy League admissions board

28:04.600 --> 28:08.571
that could resist that.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.286
And think of the other children out there,

28:11.400 --> 28:15.969
innocent children who are subjected
to their repressive belief system.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.923
And not forgetting
the financial opportunities.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.451
Yes.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.131
Ms. Wesley is an employee
of the school board.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.368
We win in court and we
establish her misconduct

28:24.480 --> 28:28.569
as said paid employee, well, there's
nothing that changes policy faster

28:28.680 --> 28:32.480
than a big, expensive settlement.

28:32.600 --> 28:38.050
We're going to prove once
and for all that God is dead.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.570
Brooke is a minor.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.843
As far as the court is
concerned, she has no rights.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.248
That simply means I won't be
asking her to be a witness.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.331
I feel supremely confident about this.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.446
Okay.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.848
Injunctive relief?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.325
They're asking that you be fired,

29:22.440 --> 29:24.568
plus revocation of your
teaching certificate.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.011
What? How am I supposed to...

29:26.160 --> 29:28.208
Plus attorney's fees.

29:28.320 --> 29:32.848
Essentially, you'll lose everything.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.525
Why are they doing this?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.847
They want to make an example of you.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.169
To them, your beliefs are like a disease
whose time has come and gone,

29:41.280 --> 29:46.127
sort of like smallpox,
or polio, or the plague.

29:48.960 --> 29:52.169
So, what do we do?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.282
We win.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.850
Hey, what's going on?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.600
Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.761
Idiot.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.211
Hey, shut up, loser.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.336
At least she's standing for something.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.600
Give me that.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.247
Brooke, you need to stop this immediately.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.442
Brooke, this is the last
time I'm gonna tell you.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.445
If you don't stop this right now,
there are gonna be some consequences.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.164
Actually, I don't think that there will,

30:21.280 --> 30:24.124
because this is a sidewalk,
which is public property.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.163
My dad's a lawyer.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.490
Well, actually, this sidewalk
is on school property.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.291
I suggest you girls aren't late for class.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.801
Yes, ma'am.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.082
Hey, what are you doing?

30:51.240 --> 30:52.844
I'm just, you know, reading the paper

30:52.960 --> 30:57.010
while my laptop goes through
my online jury orientation.

30:57.120 --> 31:01.523
Well, shouldn't you be paying attention?

31:01.640 --> 31:04.041
Please remember, consumption
of alcoholic beverages,

31:04.160 --> 31:08.045
nonprescription drugs, and weapons
are prohibited in the courtroom.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.403
Still, isn't it your civic duty?

31:11.520 --> 31:15.764
Theoretically, yeah, but Matthew 22:14.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.405
Oh, "Many are called, few are chosen."

31:17.560 --> 31:19.210
Exactly.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.971
Three hundred people show up,
they sit around for 8 hours,

31:22.080 --> 31:26.044
and at the end of the day, they all
go home, having not been selected.

31:26.160 --> 31:31.122
Statistically, I have a better chance
of being hit by lightning.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.044
Gotta get some coffee.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.531
All right.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.324
It's called "voir dire."

31:36.440 --> 31:38.816
It means that we get a chance to
eliminate any potential jurors

31:38.840 --> 31:41.650
that may have a bias against you.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.125
- Sir.
- Oh!

31:43.240 --> 31:44.401
Thank you, sir.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.521
So, how are you feeling?

31:45.640 --> 31:47.130
I'm good.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.136
All right, well, this is
a bit of an arduous process.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.536
They bring all these jurors in.
It's gonna take the whole day,

31:51.560 --> 31:53.767
but I think this is where
we can win the case.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.322
All rise for the
Honorable Judge Robert Stennis.

32:12.600 --> 32:17.289
On the order of the matter
of Thawley vs. Wesley, you may be seated.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.402
So, it says here... what does it say?

32:22.520 --> 32:24.443
It says you're a psychic.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.528
Yes.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.369
Oh, do you know who's gonna win this case?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.164
No, don't answer that.

32:30.280 --> 32:34.126
We're going to challenge
this juror, Your Honor.

32:34.240 --> 32:39.041
Ms. Bailey,
what's your favorite TV show?

32:39.160 --> 32:41.891
"Pretty Little Liars."

32:42.000 --> 32:44.128
Peremptory challenge, Your Honor.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.368
What is your favorite TV show?

32:48.480 --> 32:52.121
"Duck Dynasty."

32:52.280 --> 32:55.011
Peremptory challenge, Your Honor.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.764
"Duck Dynasty."

32:56.880 --> 33:01.091
Ms. Smith, are you involved in any
community or charitable organizations?

33:01.200 --> 33:03.567
Yes, the Salvation Army.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.523
We'll accept this juror, Your Honor.

33:05.640 --> 33:09.611
Juror number nine, you're a teacher.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.404
I'm a retired teacher.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.683
Ever have any disciplinary
run-ins with the administration?

33:14.800 --> 33:17.280
Never.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.721
Acceptable to the plaintiff, Your Honor.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.330
Acceptable, Your Honor.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.329
Peremptory challenge, Your Honor.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.845
We'll take her, Your Honor.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.405
Thank you, Mr. Cherry.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.807
Preemptive challenge, Your Honor.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.322
Number two just screams Marine.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.726
I don't want him.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.456
That would mean
blowing our last challenge.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.891
Well, we have no choice.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.002
I mean, what part of "God, Country,
and Corps" do you wanna put on that jury?

33:41.160 --> 33:44.243
What was your last paid position?

33:44.360 --> 33:48.649
Artillery Forward Observer,
United States Marine Corps.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.366
Peremptory challenge, Your Honor.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.244
Thank you.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.364
Your Honor, we'd like
to challenge for cause.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.130
Why is that?

34:01.240 --> 34:03.163
Oh, Your Honor, the man's
an ordained minister.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.329
Need I say more?

34:06.480 --> 34:07.925
The juror is excused.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.042
Objection, Your Honor.

34:10.159 --> 34:11.491
Basis, Mr. Endler?

34:11.600 --> 34:13.364
Discriminatory, Your Honor.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.255
Peremptory challenges can not
be used to discriminate

34:15.280 --> 34:17.408
against a certain class
of juror based on race,

34:17.520 --> 34:20.045
ethnic background, religion, or gender.

34:20.199 --> 34:26.368
And the fact that religious belief is
tangential to this case doesn't change that.

34:28.920 --> 34:33.563
Upon further reflection, I find
the respondent's assertion is correct.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.011
Sustained.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.804
You're not her pastor, are you?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.206
No, Your Honor.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.889
Your Honor, I must protest here.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.487
Mr. Kane, now, you had
a set number of peremptory challenges,

34:44.639 --> 34:46.802
all of which you have used.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.002
Therefore, it's up to opposing counsel.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.600
We accept him, Your Honor.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.449
Welcome to the jury, sir.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.928
Henceforth, juror number twelve.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.203
I hope you enjoy your
service to the community.

35:00.320 --> 35:02.800
Better chance of
being struck by lightning.

35:07.880 --> 35:13.569
It amazes me how we,
as human beings, think.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.047
When I was battling for my life,

35:16.160 --> 35:21.087
I was willing to hold onto
anything, including God,

35:21.200 --> 35:25.605
even though I really didn't believe
in him until that moment.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.566
I was convinced that I felt him,

35:29.680 --> 35:34.242
but now that I'm officially in remission,

35:34.400 --> 35:37.483
I find myself questioning everything.

35:37.600 --> 35:45.326
So, effective immediately,
this blog is the personal diary

35:45.440 --> 35:47.966
of one woman's exploration of faith

35:48.120 --> 35:52.762
on her own terms, cancer-free.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.164
Hey, Martin. How's it going?

36:04.280 --> 36:06.169
Very good, Pastor Dave.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.691
Oh, please.

36:10.600 --> 36:14.650
You sure?

36:14.760 --> 36:18.651
Well, it seems that for
every question you answered,

36:18.760 --> 36:21.127
three or four more questions spring up.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.011
Yeah, but that's a good thing, right?

36:24.160 --> 36:27.369
It's like what Einstein
said about science.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.687
Picture what you know
like the light of a candle.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.882
As the circle of knowledge expands,

36:32.040 --> 36:35.408
so does the circumference
of darkness around it.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.724
So, I'm actually learning,
even though I might not feel like it.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.929
Yes, exactly.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.089
Well, I've been studying the Beatitudes.

36:46.200 --> 36:50.888
They're very hard, one might say
impossible, to follow completely.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.241
Here in Luke's account, Jesus says,

36:53.360 --> 36:56.330
"Do unto others as you
have them do unto you."

36:56.480 --> 36:58.369
But how is that possible?

36:58.480 --> 37:00.608
How can I react to
the needs of everyone else

37:00.720 --> 37:04.361
the same as my own, even for one day,

37:04.480 --> 37:06.164
let alone my whole life?

37:06.280 --> 37:10.803
And how can I reconcile my inability
to do so with Scripture?

37:10.920 --> 37:14.766
Yeah, those are good questions.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.402
Okay, scoot over.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.526
What is that, Luke?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.961
Yes, 6:20.

37:24.080 --> 37:28.720
"And Jesus said to his disciples,
'You who are poor are blessed

37:28.840 --> 37:30.842
"'because the kingdom of God is yours.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.884
"'You who are now hungry are blessed
'because you will be filled.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.210
"'You who now weep are blessed
because you will laugh.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.728
"'You are blessed when people
hate you, when they exclude you,

37:42.840 --> 37:45.810
"'insult you,
and slander your name as evil

37:45.920 --> 37:47.843
because of the Son of Man."'

37:59.120 --> 38:03.011
You can't win.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.406
Thanks.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.090
I'll take that under advisement.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.726
Oh, come on, you know I'm right.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.126
I mean, why do it?

38:10.240 --> 38:11.924
Why go through this whole exercise, huh?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.610
Here, thanks.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.405
You know, I looked up your history.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.642
You're better than this.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.161
You were third in your
class at Stanford Law.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.851
You clerked for a judge
on the Ninth Circuit.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.849
Why you slumming like this?

38:25.960 --> 38:27.976
Maybe I believe that people
that don't do anything wrong

38:28.000 --> 38:30.970
shouldn't suffer at the hands of the law.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.851
You know what hate is, Tom?

38:33.960 --> 38:38.326
I'm not talking about the fairy tale
stuff, I mean real hate.

38:38.440 --> 38:42.604
I hate what people
like your client stand for

38:42.720 --> 38:45.530
and what they're doing to our society,

38:45.640 --> 38:49.611
and Stennis does, too,
even if he doesn't admit it.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.250
Well, the jury doesn't hate her.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.691
Ah, but that's the secret, Tommy.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.370
They don't need to hate her.

38:54.480 --> 38:59.646
They just need to see a tiny
flaw in her, a half truth,

38:59.760 --> 39:03.128
a small inconsistency,
just a little bit of doubt,

39:03.240 --> 39:05.811
and they'll find against her.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.491
Nice shoes.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.400
You ready?

39:28.400 --> 39:30.402
Come on.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.488
Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment

39:34.640 --> 39:39.043
of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.

39:39.160 --> 39:43.520
The first half of this passage
is known as the establishment clause.

39:43.640 --> 39:48.521
The second half is known as
the free exercise clause.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.210
Now, there has been an ongoing debate

39:50.320 --> 39:52.721
about what the role
of government should be,

39:52.840 --> 39:55.684
because in practice, these two provisions

39:55.800 --> 39:57.962
are often in conflict,

39:58.120 --> 40:02.205
which is what brings us here today.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.051
In the matter of Thawley vs. Wesley,

40:05.160 --> 40:07.561
is the plaintiff prepared to
make its opening statement?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.011
We are, Your Honor.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.441
Then proceed.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.928
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a jury of this size,

40:15.040 --> 40:20.285
I'm imagining that there are,
probably among your ranks,

40:20.400 --> 40:22.607
a few Christians.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.200
Hopefully practicing ones,

40:25.360 --> 40:28.250
and that's a good thing, that's fine,

40:28.400 --> 40:30.767
because Christianity is not on trial here,

40:30.880 --> 40:36.569
even though my opponent will
try to convince you that it is.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.968
Nor is faith on trial.

40:40.120 --> 40:47.288
Only Ms. Wesley is on trial here today.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.085
Now, ask any 4th grader

40:50.200 --> 40:53.090
and they're probably
familiar with the phrase,

40:53.200 --> 40:57.171
"Separation of church and state,"

40:57.280 --> 41:01.842
and that is guaranteed
to us under our laws.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.281
The plaintiffs
are the parents of a student

41:04.440 --> 41:08.968
in Ms. Wesley's class
who was subjected to hearing

41:09.080 --> 41:13.290
the teachings of Jesus Christ
being favorably compared

41:13.400 --> 41:15.562
to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.887
We all know that Jesus is part

41:18.000 --> 41:23.131
of a particular religious tradition.

41:23.240 --> 41:27.570
These parents, who are trying to raise
their daughter to be a free thinker,

41:27.680 --> 41:30.445
free of any religious dogma,

41:30.560 --> 41:34.884
are wholly offended by what
went on in that classroom.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.480
And she, reciting the words

41:37.640 --> 41:41.087
that were allegedly attributed to Jesus,

41:41.200 --> 41:44.090
who allegedly lived 2,000 years ago,

41:44.200 --> 41:49.081
gave a clear and compelling indication

41:49.200 --> 41:55.242
of what she believes, what she supports,

41:55.360 --> 41:57.567
what she endorses.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.409
Now, let me put it this way.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.570
I don't mean to offend anyone
who may be a Muslim here,

42:03.680 --> 42:06.365
and I do not want to slight
the prophet of Islam,

42:06.480 --> 42:09.324
but if you were to ask me a
question concerning the Quran,

42:09.440 --> 42:11.488
the sacred text of Islam,

42:11.600 --> 42:16.331
and I could come up with the answer
with great speed and accuracy,

42:16.440 --> 42:20.684
and I could quote
the proper surah, or chapter,

42:20.800 --> 42:25.966
then it would be reasonable
for you to infer

42:26.080 --> 42:31.962
that I was not only a follower of Islam,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.970
but that I considered it to be superior

42:35.080 --> 42:37.731
to all other forms of religion.

42:37.840 --> 42:43.688
If I did this in a house of
worship, that would be fine.

42:43.800 --> 42:48.761
But if I did it in an 11th grade
classroom in a public school,

42:48.920 --> 42:53.164
that would be preaching, not teaching.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.886
So, why? Why in the world
are we here today?

42:56.000 --> 43:00.403
Why? Because Ms. Wesley
refused to apologize,

43:00.520 --> 43:05.164
and that means that her true motivation
in that moment in her classroom

43:05.280 --> 43:09.524
was to take an innocent question

43:09.640 --> 43:17.001
and turn it into an opportunity
to preach, not teach.

43:17.120 --> 43:22.524
If we grant Ms. Wesley
the right to do that,

43:22.640 --> 43:25.405
and by extension, everyone else,

43:25.520 --> 43:32.005
to violate the law based solely
on our own private beliefs,

43:32.120 --> 43:35.886
then our society will crumble.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.525
I believe that.

43:37.640 --> 43:42.680
So, I implore you, please
do not set this precedent.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.325
Do not.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.284
The future of our republic depends on it.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.124
What's going on?

44:04.240 --> 44:06.242
Brooke is exercising
her right to protest.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.886
Brooke, I need you
to stop this immediately.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.725
Brooke, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

44:11.840 --> 44:15.083
If you don't stop right now,
there are gonna be consequences.

44:16.680 --> 44:17.681
Hey, Aunt Amy.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.251
Hey, Marlene.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.089
Yeah, I just saw the video,
what's going on?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.611
So, you remember my friend, Brooke?

44:22.760 --> 44:23.921
Yeah.

44:24.040 --> 44:26.761
Well, she got a teacher in trouble
for asking her about Jesus.

44:26.880 --> 44:28.325
What?

44:28.440 --> 44:30.096
Now she's not even
supposed to talk about it

44:30.120 --> 44:32.248
and we can't even cover it
in our school paper.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.840
Is there any way that
I could meet with her?

44:34.960 --> 44:38.726
- The teacher?
- No, Brooke.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.690
Mr. Endler,
your opening statement.

44:45.320 --> 44:50.041
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
I have here a copy of the Constitution

44:50.160 --> 44:53.804
of the United States of America
and its Bill of Rights,

44:53.960 --> 44:59.041
arguably the two most important documents
in the history of our great nation.

44:59.160 --> 45:03.051
But despite Mr. Kane's
impassioned rhetoric,

45:03.160 --> 45:07.204
you know what you won't find in there
no matter how hard you look?

45:07.320 --> 45:12.486
The phrase "Separation
of church and state."

45:12.600 --> 45:14.204
That's right.

45:14.320 --> 45:18.600
It's not in there, never has been,
because that phrase comes from a letter

45:18.720 --> 45:21.121
written by Thomas Jefferson.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.805
Now, ironically, Jefferson was writing
to a Baptist congregation, ensuring them

45:25.920 --> 45:27.524
that they would always have the right

45:27.640 --> 45:31.565
to believe as they wished,
free of government interference.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.241
But lately, that phrase has
been taken out of context

45:35.360 --> 45:39.449
and twisted and contorted
to mean the exact opposite.

45:39.560 --> 45:43.121
And one morning early this year,
my client, Ms. Wesley,

45:43.240 --> 45:47.241
she woke up as usual, she drove
to work at her job as a teacher

45:47.360 --> 45:49.044
at Martin Luther King High School,

45:49.160 --> 45:52.084
a place where she was Teacher of the Year.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.601
Her lesson plan
for second period A.P. history

45:54.720 --> 45:59.009
that morning, it didn't include
any mention of God or Jesus.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.920
She didn't have a Bible sitting
on her desk in plain view.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.576
She didn't start her class
with a blessing.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.284
She didn't lead her students in prayer.

46:06.400 --> 46:12.282
No, all she did was answer a question,

46:12.400 --> 46:15.802
because that is what she gets paid to do.

46:15.960 --> 46:18.930
Now, Mr. Kane will insist loudly and often

46:19.040 --> 46:21.042
that faith isn't on trial here,

46:21.160 --> 46:23.401
but that is exactly what is on trial,

46:23.520 --> 46:27.730
the most basic human right
of all, the right to believe.

46:27.840 --> 46:30.844
Mr. Kane's afraid.

46:30.960 --> 46:36.808
He's afraid that you, the jury,
the touchstone of common sense,

46:36.920 --> 46:39.287
might not agree with
his tortured interpretation

46:39.440 --> 46:41.807
of the Constitution,

46:41.920 --> 46:45.322
that you might understand
that my client has rights,

46:45.440 --> 46:50.571
rights that trump his agenda,
and that in realizing that

46:50.680 --> 46:52.728
you will hold as I do

46:52.840 --> 46:55.446
that my client is guilty of no wrongdoing

46:55.560 --> 46:59.690
and innocent of any
and all claims against her.

47:01.800 --> 47:04.007
Thank you very much.

47:12.440 --> 47:14.044
And now it's become
this huge deal,

47:14.160 --> 47:17.482
and all she did was answer my question.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.251
Why do you think your
parents are doing this?

47:20.360 --> 47:22.727
Because my mom thinks
it'll help me get into Stanford

47:22.840 --> 47:28.006
or one of the Ivys, and my dad
thinks it'll help pay for it.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.690
And nobody's asked you what you think?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.450
No.

47:31.560 --> 47:35.645
So, are you gonna help her?

47:35.760 --> 47:38.525
I don't know.

47:38.640 --> 47:41.405
I would at least like to talk to her.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.046
Maybe I could help get
her story out there.

47:44.160 --> 47:47.528
Great, because everyone's
telling me to stay out of it.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.049
Do you always do what you're told?

47:53.080 --> 47:55.845
What is your heart telling you to do?

47:58.200 --> 48:00.407
Mr. Thawley, how did
you feel when you found out

48:00.560 --> 48:02.608
that your daughter had been exposed

48:02.720 --> 48:05.803
to faith-based teachings in class?

48:05.920 --> 48:07.684
Well, it felt like we had been violated.

48:07.800 --> 48:11.210
I mean, this was supposed to be
a history class, not Sunday school.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.004
My wife and I are free thinkers.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.605
We're rationalists.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.320
We believe in a non-theistic world view,

48:16.360 --> 48:18.601
and that's how we were trying
to raise our daughter.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.007
And did you discuss this
incident with your daughter?

48:21.120 --> 48:24.490
Well, I tried, but it's hard discussing
anything with kids that age.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.125
She's 16.

48:26.240 --> 48:28.402
Some of you know what that's like.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.126
It's hard enough trying to
maintain credibility as a parent

48:31.240 --> 48:34.963
without a teacher jumping in
and arguing against your position.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.056
Now, we trust the school
not to overstep its bounds

48:37.080 --> 48:39.367
in terms of what is
and what isn't appropriate.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.851
Is that too much to ask?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.450
No. Thank you, Mr. Thawley.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.130
That's all, Your Honor.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.720
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.763
No questions, Your Honor.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.486
Next witness, Mr. Kane.

48:51.600 --> 48:56.606
Mrs. Rizzo, did Ms. Wesley
talk about faith issues

48:56.720 --> 48:58.245
on the school campus?

48:58.360 --> 48:59.646
All the time.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.808
Everybody knows she's a Christian.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.400
I don't think she'd chew a stick
of gum without praying first.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.602
It makes everyone feel awkward.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.245
Thank you.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.761
No further questions, Your Honor.

49:10.880 --> 49:13.201
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

49:14.720 --> 49:20.087
Mrs. Rizzo, you stated that Ms. Wesley
talks about her faith all the time.

49:20.200 --> 49:24.364
I'm curious, can you
give me a specific instance?

49:24.520 --> 49:27.126
Well, not off the top of my head.

49:27.240 --> 49:31.204
Well, has she, as far as you're aware,
ever started her class with a prayer?

49:31.360 --> 49:33.010
No.

49:33.120 --> 49:36.087
Has she ever asked anyone
in the teacher's lounge to pray with her?

49:36.240 --> 49:37.844
No.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.361
Has she ever asked you
personally to pray with her?

49:40.480 --> 49:41.641
Objection, Your Honor.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.285
- No.
- Cumulative.

49:43.400 --> 49:45.767
The question has effectively
been asked and answered.

49:45.920 --> 49:48.287
Your Honor, Mrs. Rizzo's
sworn testimony states

49:48.400 --> 49:51.290
that Ms. Wesley talked
about her faith all the time,

49:51.400 --> 49:53.323
yet she's failed to cite
a single instance.

49:53.440 --> 49:56.603
I'm merely trying to discover
some basis for her opinion.

49:56.760 --> 49:58.410
Sustained.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.376
Mr. Endler, we're done with
this line of questioning.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.006
Mrs. Rizzo,
in the school's initial inquiry

50:03.120 --> 50:05.646
into this matter, you were
Ms. Wesley's representative

50:05.760 --> 50:07.887
on behalf of the teacher's
union, were you not?

50:08.000 --> 50:09.490
Yes.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.976
And did you ever consider
that your disapproval

50:11.000 --> 50:13.924
of her faith might taint your ability

50:14.040 --> 50:15.326
to represent her properly?

50:15.440 --> 50:16.521
Objection, speculative.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.721
Sustained.

50:19.280 --> 50:20.725
God bless you.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.336
Careful, or you might end up on trial.

50:22.360 --> 50:25.284
Mr. Endler!

50:25.400 --> 50:27.482
No further questions, Your Honor.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.446
So, when
are these religious zealots

50:33.560 --> 50:38.289
going to realize it's not only disrespectful
of them to push their beliefs on others,

50:38.400 --> 50:40.926
in this case, it's actually illegal?

50:41.040 --> 50:44.840
This woman, this fundamentalist,
used her position of influence

50:44.960 --> 50:49.045
as a teacher to fill the minds
of our children with nonsense.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.969
If you ask me, the religious extremists

50:51.080 --> 50:54.527
we need to worry about
are the hard-core Christians.

50:54.640 --> 50:57.610
How about we show up in force
and show Ms. Wesley just exactly

50:57.720 --> 51:00.007
what we think of her proselytizing?

51:00.320 --> 51:05.122
Principal Kinney, what was
the school district's final determination?

51:05.240 --> 51:07.846
Well, Grace
has been suspended without pay

51:08.000 --> 51:10.401
pending the result of this trial.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.171
Isn't it rather unusual,
leaving it up to a third party

51:13.280 --> 51:17.330
to determine whether Ms. Wesley is fired?

51:17.440 --> 51:19.090
We've decided to accept

51:19.200 --> 51:21.362
the court's interpretation
of wrongdoing either way.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.811
No questions, Your Honor.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.331
Your witness, Mr. Endler.

51:24.440 --> 51:28.361
Ms. Kinney, can you tell me
the full name of the high school

51:28.520 --> 51:30.010
over which you preside?

51:30.120 --> 51:33.602
Doctor Martin Luther King Junior
Memorial High School.

51:33.720 --> 51:35.563
I noticed that the name
fails to mention

51:35.680 --> 51:38.126
Dr. King's title as Reverend Doctor.

51:38.280 --> 51:42.364
It's his work in the field of civil rights
that we prefer to highlight.

51:42.480 --> 51:44.209
But that's the whole point.

51:44.320 --> 51:48.282
You consider his faith and politics
to be separate things,

51:48.400 --> 51:51.051
but I don't,
and he certainly wouldn't have.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.571
Objection, Your Honor.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.170
Counsel is testifying.

51:54.280 --> 51:56.089
Sustained.

51:56.200 --> 52:00.205
Jury's instructed to ignore
Mr. Endler's preceding remarks.

52:00.320 --> 52:04.010
Ms. Kinney, are you familiar with
Dr. King's letter from the Birmingham Jail?

52:04.120 --> 52:07.168
Yes, it's a seminal
piece of civil rights history.

52:07.280 --> 52:11.809
In that letter Dr. King makes numerous
faith-based references, does he not?

52:11.920 --> 52:13.968
Offhand, I don't recall.

52:14.080 --> 52:17.129
Allow me to refresh your memory.

52:19.040 --> 52:22.123
He cites the example of the three youths

52:22.280 --> 52:25.363
from the book of Daniel who were
tossed into the fiery furnace

52:25.480 --> 52:28.450
by King Nebuchadnezzar because
they refused to worship him.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.971
Elsewhere, he urges action with Jesus,
and here I quote, "Extremist love."

52:34.080 --> 52:36.040
And in his speech,
"I've Been to the Mountaintop,"

52:36.120 --> 52:39.408
he stated that he just wanted
to do God's will.

52:39.520 --> 52:41.124
Is this coming back to you now?

52:41.240 --> 52:42.571
Yes.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.290
In your opinion, would Ms. Wesley,

52:44.400 --> 52:46.880
had she chosen to do so,
have been allowed to present

52:47.000 --> 52:48.696
the examples that I just
mentioned in her class?

52:48.720 --> 52:50.290
Objection, speculative.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.765
I'm going to allow it.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.166
Overruled.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.282
Witness may answer.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.610
No.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.849
If it were up to me, she would
not have been allowed.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.450
Why not?

53:02.560 --> 53:05.046
Because those examples
are too closely associated with faith.

53:05.200 --> 53:06.929
In other words, they're facts,

53:07.040 --> 53:10.806
but they're just facts that are
too dangerous for discussion?

53:10.920 --> 53:13.446
The word I would use would be
"controversial."

53:13.560 --> 53:16.450
But aren't facts just facts?

53:16.560 --> 53:18.130
I mean, there's nothing controversial

53:18.240 --> 53:22.643
about 2 plus 2 equaling 4,
or E equals MC squared,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.768
or the date man landed on the moon.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.167
So, why the controversy about these facts?

53:27.280 --> 53:31.242
I think the fact that we're all
here today speaks for itself.

53:34.080 --> 53:36.128
Thank you for your honesty.

53:38.360 --> 53:40.488
One last question.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.490
In your orientation
at the beginning of the semester,

53:43.600 --> 53:49.244
your memo to the staff stressed
diversity and tolerance, did it not?

53:49.360 --> 53:51.089
Yes.

53:51.200 --> 53:54.283
Well, would it be fair to say
that except for Christianity,

53:54.400 --> 53:56.368
all other forms of diversity are welcome?

53:56.480 --> 53:57.720
Objection!

53:57.880 --> 53:58.881
Your Honor!

53:59.000 --> 54:00.650
I will withdraw the question.

54:00.760 --> 54:02.649
Mr. Endler,
you seem to have a penchant

54:02.800 --> 54:05.451
for injecting commentary
where it doesn't belong.

54:05.560 --> 54:09.484
You would do well to avoid
further provocation of this court.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.608
I apologize, Your Honor.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.610
I'll look to curtail it in the future.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.490
Redirect, Your Honor?

54:20.160 --> 54:24.688
Ms. Kinney, I understand
that you attended a service

54:24.800 --> 54:27.485
at Ms. Wesley's church a short while ago.

54:27.600 --> 54:28.931
Is that correct?

54:29.040 --> 54:30.690
Yes, that's correct.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.690
It was an event honoring several
students who attend that church

54:33.800 --> 54:35.086
for their community service.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.690
Mm-hmm.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.690
And who was it that
invited you to that service?

54:39.800 --> 54:41.086
Grace Wesley.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.690
I see.

54:42.840 --> 54:45.684
And where were you when
this invitation was extended?

54:45.840 --> 54:47.126
At my office.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.571
On school grounds?

54:48.720 --> 54:50.643
Yes.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.047
During work hours?

54:53.160 --> 54:55.891
Yes.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.128
Thank you.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.441
Oh, one last question.

55:02.560 --> 55:05.882
Is it true that Ms. Wesley
accepts donations

55:06.000 --> 55:11.245
for a faith-based charity, Convoy of Hope,

55:11.360 --> 55:14.364
right there in the classroom?

55:14.480 --> 55:16.562
Yes, she does.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.170
Thank you again.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.601
No further questions, Your Honor.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.365
You may step down, Mrs. Kinney.

55:27.480 --> 55:29.244
Court's adjourned.

55:33.800 --> 55:37.043
Grace, can I ask you a question,

55:37.160 --> 55:39.367
off the record?

55:39.520 --> 55:40.931
Sure.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.008
These people, they're
looking to destroy you,

55:43.120 --> 55:47.011
and I don't just mean financially.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.088
Do you think it's worth it?

55:51.400 --> 55:53.721
I hope so.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.771
So do I.

56:14.120 --> 56:15.690
Fishy and cheesy at the same time.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.882
David, this tuna melt is exquisite.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.604
Oh, yeah, exquisite.

56:19.720 --> 56:21.210
It's the provolone.

56:21.320 --> 56:22.810
That was my idea.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.764
I love what it does
to the flavor of the fish.

56:25.880 --> 56:27.325
Don't I know you?

56:27.440 --> 56:28.965
You're from Blaze's Car Rental, right?

56:29.080 --> 56:30.684
Oh, yeah.

56:30.800 --> 56:34.168
Yeah, that gig didn't
really work out for me.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.601
I don't think customer
service is my forte.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.688
So, you decided to become a waiter?

56:38.800 --> 56:40.643
Well, this is where
I do my dinner theatre.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.489
In the mornings I serve up croissants.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.364
In the evenings I serve up Chekhov.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.005
Oh.

56:46.120 --> 56:50.364
Hey, listen, sorry about
the whole car not working thing.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.845
It's okay.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.530
I learned my lesson.

56:53.680 --> 56:54.966
He bought a Prius.

56:55.080 --> 56:56.525
Starts every time.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.045
Oh!

57:01.560 --> 57:02.846
- Same guy.
- Same guy.

57:02.960 --> 57:06.043
Amazing.

57:06.160 --> 57:10.484
Gentlemen, I don't wanna
spoil your brunch,

57:10.600 --> 57:13.570
but I'm hearing from a friend of mine

57:13.680 --> 57:15.842
in the prosecutor's office
about a subpoena

57:15.960 --> 57:20.363
that just came down
demanding that we submit

57:20.480 --> 57:26.965
copies of our sermons for
the last 3 months for review.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.803
Can they do that?

57:30.920 --> 57:32.888
They tried it in Houston.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.721
So, now the government can determine what
we can and can't preach at our churches?

57:36.840 --> 57:38.251
Let's not overreact.

57:38.360 --> 57:40.089
I'm sure there's no ill intent here.

57:40.200 --> 57:44.125
Unfortunately, I think
this is just the beginning.

57:44.240 --> 57:49.280
We've been ignoring it, and now
we're paying the price for it.

57:49.440 --> 57:51.681
Well, don't forget
the silent majority.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.131
They're out there.

57:53.280 --> 57:55.203
They just need something to stand for.

57:55.320 --> 57:59.764
Well I'll admit there's pressure, but I
think with time this will correct itself.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.680
Forgive me,
but I think you're wrong.

58:03.800 --> 58:07.284
I'm serving on a jury in a case right
now that touches on these issues.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.216
And of course, I'm not allowed
to talk about it,

58:09.240 --> 58:12.323
but I mean, the one thing
that it's convinced me of

58:12.440 --> 58:14.841
is that if we stand by and do nothing,

58:14.960 --> 58:18.443
pressure that we're feeling today
is gonna mean persecution tomorrow.

58:18.560 --> 58:20.528
What makes you so sure?

58:20.680 --> 58:25.641
Speed of change,
viciousness of the opposition.

58:25.760 --> 58:27.800
The message of the gospel
has us standing in the way

58:27.840 --> 58:30.047
of a lot of things
that powerful people want,

58:30.160 --> 58:32.970
and our resistance to change that message

58:33.080 --> 58:36.527
because it's not ours to change
has made us a lot of enemies.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.371
Whether we admit it or not, we're at war,

58:39.480 --> 58:42.324
the war of Ephesians 6,
not against flesh and blood,

58:42.440 --> 58:44.568
but against the powers of this world,

58:44.680 --> 58:48.002
against the spiritual forces
in the heavenly realms.

58:48.120 --> 58:53.206
And if we insist on denying that,

58:53.320 --> 58:56.085
then we've already lost.

59:09.080 --> 59:12.729
I brought a giant bag of Chinese food
and a briefcase full of files.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.968
I say we eat first.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.605
I say you're a genius.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.610
Does Walter want to join us?

59:19.720 --> 59:22.041
Oh, no. He's hiding in his room.

59:22.200 --> 59:23.725
How come?

59:23.840 --> 59:26.491
He's treating this like it's a date,

59:26.600 --> 59:30.050
which should give you some indication
of what my social life is like.

59:30.160 --> 59:31.685
Don't worry, I won't tell.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.644
Falls under attorney-client privilege.

59:34.800 --> 59:38.130
So, is this what you always saw
yourself doing, the lawyer thing?

59:38.240 --> 59:40.163
No, um...

59:40.280 --> 59:43.363
I wanted to be Batman.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.050
How 'bout you?

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
Your parents have you all set
to go to the convent?

59:47.240 --> 59:50.766
Actually, there were no bedtime
prayers in my childhood.

59:50.880 --> 59:54.089
I was raised in a house
without much faith.

59:54.200 --> 59:56.680
When did you decide to become a Christian?

59:56.800 --> 59:59.041
I was walking home from class.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:05.441
It was dark, and I was
struggling with a lot of things.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.520
And I turned the corner, and right
there in front of me was this church.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.450
It had this old sign out front,

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.609
but it just stopped me in my tracks.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.931
And the sign... the sign said,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.090
"Who do you say that I am?"

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.843
And as I read it, I could hear
the Lord speak to me.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.567
You know, I couldn't get that question
out of my head for days,

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.967
so that was the start
of a journey that didn't end

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.651
until I found the answer.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:48.840
♪ Nearer, my God, to thee ♪

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.562
♪ Nearer to thee ♪

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.281
That was beautiful.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.081
Forgive me, but I did
not know anyone was here.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.336
Oh, no. Please don't apologize.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.684
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.088
I just didn't know where else to go.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.567
I'm Martin.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.011
I'm Brooke.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.088
Do you think I could
ask you a few questions?

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.047
That would be fine.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.049
Good, 'cause I have a lot.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.369
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.811
But I thought you proved bias.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.520
I mean, Principal Kinney and Mrs. Rizzo?

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.050
Those were just jabs.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.289
We need a knockout punch.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.890
Why did you feel compelled

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.765
to bring Jesus up in history class?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.849
Why shouldn't I have?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.771
Grace, I'm not here to debate with you
what you think your rights were as...

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.724
No, Tom, listen.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.081
This isn't about faith.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.242
This is about history.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.691
Okay, maybe I'm wrong here.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.165
I'm not the law expert,

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.285
but I think they've missed the point.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.164
I'm not sure I follow.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.250
Their whole attack,
it's about me preaching in class,

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.885
but I didn't do that.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.490
They're saying you did.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.204
You cited Scripture.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.288
You talked about Jesus'
teachings just like

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.882
they were any other verifiable fact.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.650
But what if they're just that?

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.366
I mean, just because certain
facts happen to be recorded

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.285
in the Bible doesn't mean
they stop being facts.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.249
We can separate the history-based elements

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.609
of Jesus' life from
the faith-based element.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.200
I mean, in my classroom,
I didn't talk about Jesus

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.482
as my Lord and Savior.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.602
You know, all I did was
comment on quotations

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.441
attributed to Jesus, the man,
and I did it in A.P. History.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.210
There was nothing wrong with the context.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.122
And any rule saying that you can talk about
any historic figure that ever existed

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.084
except Jesus is discriminatory.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.804
They can't institute that.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.321
And every credible historian
admits that Jesus existed.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.000
I mean, there's just too much evidence.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.769
Grace, I love it.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.564
This is our defense.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.968
Jesus as a historic figure,
just like everyone else.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.650
And you know what?

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.047
Kane will never see it coming.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.841
You got some reading to do.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.362
He just had so many notes
written in the margins

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.165
that for the first time I felt like I was

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.726
truly getting to know my brother.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.362
Like God gave me the extra 5 minutes

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.448
that I so desperately needed with him.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.481
I just don't understand why he
never told me about his faith.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.211
Sharing one's faith with family,

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.688
especially not knowing
how they will react,

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.326
can be difficult.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.761
Count our struggles as blessings, right?

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.890
That is exactly right.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:31.769
There are more than 5 minutes
awaiting you and your brother.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.209
John chapter 11, verse 25 to 26 says,

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.765
"I am the resurrection and the life.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.442
"He who believes in me
will live even if he dies.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.086
"And whoever lives and believes in me

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.407
will never die."

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.962
Do you believe this?

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.844
I do.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.247
Then invite him into your heart

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.085
and make him the Lord of your life.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.607
Dear Lord, I'm not quite sure what to say,

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.080
but thank you for dying
on the cross for me.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:25.682
Please forgive me of my sin.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.691
Jesus, please come into my life,

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.009
and I will follow you
as my Lord and Savior.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.849
Amen.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.928
Thank you.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.166
Can you state your name
and occupation for the court?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.805
My name is Lee Strobel.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.010
I'm a professor of Christian thought
at Houston Baptist University

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.691
and the author of more than
20 books about Christianity,

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.882
including "The Case for Christ."

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.288
Can you help me prove
the existence of Jesus Christ?

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.210
Absolutely,
beyond any reasonable doubt.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.845
How so?

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.530
Actually, this court
already affirmed it

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.120
when we were called into session
and the date was given.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.046
Our calendar has been split
between B.C. and A.D.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.207
based on the birth of Jesus,
which is quite a feat if he never existed.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.369
Beyond that, historian Gary Habermas

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.041
lists 39 ancient sources for Jesus,

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.642
from which he enumerates
more than 100 reported facts

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.448
about his life, teachings,
crucifixion, and resurrection.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.769
In fact, the historical evidence
for Jesus' execution

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:55.007
is so strong that one of the most famous
New Testament scholars in the world,

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.602
Gerd Ludemann of Germany,
said, "Jesus' death

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.361
as a consequence of crucifixion
is indisputable."

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.006
Now, there are very few facts
in ancient history

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.566
that a critical historian
like Gerd Ludemann

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.206
will say is indisputable.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:13.449
One of them is the execution
of Jesus Christ.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.491
Forgive me, but you're
a believer, are you not?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.761
A Bible-believing Christian?

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.370
Guilty as charged.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.131
So, wouldn't this tend
to inflate your estimate

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.971
of the probability that Jesus existed.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.367
No, because we
don't need to inflate it.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.768
We can reconstruct
the basic facts about Jesus

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.930
just from non-Christian sources
outside the Bible.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.805
And Gerd Ludemann is an atheist.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.288
In other words, we can prove
the existence of Jesus

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.966
solely by using sources
that have absolutely

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.447
no sympathy toward Christianity.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.564
As the agnostic historian,
Bart Ehrman, says,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.890
"Jesus did exist,
whether we like it or not."

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.128
I put it this way:

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.801
Denying the existence of Jesus
doesn't make him go away.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.170
It merely proves that no amount
of evidence will convince you.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.850
Thank you.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.850
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.089
Mr. Kane, your witness.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.328
No questions, Your Honor.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.771
That's lunch.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.247
We'll recess until 2 p.m.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.769
Can I help you with something?

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.644
Oh, hi.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.570
I was looking for Pastor Dave.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:37.651
My friend, Mina, she said
I should come see him.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.604
She said he's real easy to talk to.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.609
He won't be back until after next week.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.802
Oh, okay. Thanks.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.248
Sweeping is something I only do part-time.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.170
I enjoy it because it helps me think.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.002
But if you need to talk,
I'm actually a pastor.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.529
It's been 3 weeks
since my doctors told me

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.051
I was in remission.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.685
Oh, Amy, that's wonderful.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800
It is.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.524
Yes.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.487
But even though
I've been given this gift,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.650
I've been questioning my faith.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.687
I know Jesus existed,
but I'm struggling to believe.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.406
Actually,
I think you already do believe,

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.761
and the proof is you're
not willing to put God

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.049
back on the shelf
now that your cancer is gone.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.687
He won't let you dismiss
the thought of him.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.928
Part of you senses Jesus' presence

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.170
and wishes that he would just
go away and leave you alone.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.048
Actually, now that you mention it,
I had thought of that.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:51.326
Look, he delights in using us
in ways we never dreamed of

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.365
and giving us things that we
never even knew we wanted.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.563
We just have to give him a chance.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.648
Will you?

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.728
Thank you.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.328
Hi, I'm Reverend David Hill.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.442
Sermon transcripts, right?

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.050
- Yes.
- Just put it right there.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.367
They've been coming in all morning.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.210
I'm sure they did what
they thought was best.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.049
That's it?

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.562
Those are your entire sermons
for the past 120 days?

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.643
No, that's a letter that I wrote explaining
why I'm not going to hand them in.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.842
Excuse me?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.490
I know it's unusual for a Christian pastor
to willfully resist a subpoena

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.285
issued by a lawful government authority,

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.929
and it's even more unusual
that he should feel compelled to do so.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.886
Are you sure you wanna do that?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.685
It's something that I have to do.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.522
You know the old saying, "The squeaky
wheel gets the grease," don't you?

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.608
I have another saying:

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.203
"A nail that sticks up
gets hammered down."

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.127
Susan, what I'm seeing
is a teacher who answered

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.288
a student's question
to the best of her ability.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.286
Amy, it sounds like you're taking
the side of Grace Wesley here.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.562
Surely, you see that she used
the student's question

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.409
to promote her Christian agenda.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.522
Actually, Susan,
that's not how I see it.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.120
I believe Ms. Wesley's entitled
to her own opinions,

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.009
and that includes in the classroom.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.646
She didn't try to convert these
students, in fact...

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.001
Amy, I must say,
I'm shocked at what seems to be

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.642
a complete 180 from the typical
stance of your plot.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.842
Just look at the facts
of this case for a minute.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.243
She clearly infringed on
the rights of her students.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.169
Marlene?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.805
I have an idea.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.320
Come over as soon as you can, okay?

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.731
You look terrible.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.256
You really ought to ask to be excused.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.520
No, no, I'm fine.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.967
I really need to be here.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.048
All rise.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.162
You may be seated.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.256
Juror number 12, is there
something you'd like to say?

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.045
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I gotta...

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.886
Bailiff, call paramedics.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.684
Sir.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.440
Well, I guess
that proves there is no God,

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.206
'cause they just lost the only juror
they could count on.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.765
Any dizziness?

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.649
- Yeah.
- Vomiting?

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.091
About a half hour ago.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.440
Does this hurt? How 'bout this?

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.167
I hope you're not
too attached to your appendix.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.602
Brooke! Marlene.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.649
It's not looking good in there.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.487
Ms. Marshall,
are you prepared to fulfill

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.204
your duties as an alternate?

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.322
Yes, I am, Your Honor.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.363
Mr. Endler, next witness.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.165
Would you state your name
and experience for the record?

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.884
My name is James Warner Wallace.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.725
I'm a retired homicide detective
from Los Angeles County.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.281
And are you the author of the
book, "Cold Case Christianity"?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.004
Yes, I am.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.805
Can you share the subtitle of
the book with the court, please?

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.251
"A Homicide Detective

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.960
Investigates the Claims of the Gospels."

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.641
Would I be correct in saying
that your duties as a homicide detective

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.888
include investigating cold case homicides?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.446
Yes, that is and was my expertise.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.609
Don't most of those cases
get solved with DNA evidence?

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.245
Objection, leading.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.448
And counsel is
testifying again, Your Honor.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.846
I'll rephrase.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.529
How many of your cold cases were solved
through the use of DNA evidence?

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.244
None. Not one.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.405
That's often popular on TV, but our
departments never had the good fortune

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.602
of solving a cold case with DNA.

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.927
Well, how do most
of these cases get solved?

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.042
Often by examining eyewitness claims,

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.288
witness claims that were
made many years earlier,

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.290
even though often our
witnesses are now deceased.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:09.888
Forgive my ignorance, Mr. Wallace,
but how is that possible?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.843
Well, we have a number
of techniques we can use

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.600
to test the reliability of an eyewitness,

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.968
including something called
forensic statement analysis.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.965
That's a discipline where we scrutinize
the statements of eyewitnesses

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.736
and looking at what
they choose to minimize,

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.081
what they choose to emphasize,
what they omit altogether,

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.680
how they expand time or contract time.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.326
And when we examine these
kinds of eyewitness accounts,

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.966
we can usually tell who's lying,
and who's telling the truth,

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.327
and even who the guilty party is.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.329
And did you apply this skill set anytime
outside of your official capacity?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.523
Yes, I applied my expertise
to the death of Jesus

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.168
at the hands of the Romans,
and I actually looked at the gospels

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.443
as I would any other set
of forensic statements.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.525
Within a matter of months,
I determined that the four gospels,

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.205
written from different perspectives,

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.403
contained the eyewitness
accounts about the life,

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.166
ministry, death,
and resurrection of Jesus.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.566
And did you consider that the four
accounts might be part of a conspiracy,

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.160
designed to promote belief
in a fledgling faith?

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.529
Yeah, you have to consider conspiracies
when assessing eyewitness accounts,

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.931
but successful conspiracies typically
involve the fewest number of people.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.004
It's a lot easier for 2 people to lie
and keep a secret than it is for 20.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.976
And that's really the problem
with the conspiracy theories

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.764
related to the apostles
in the 1st century.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.885
There are just far too many of them
trying to hold this conspiracy

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.360
for far too long a period of time.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.407
And far worse, they're experiencing
pressure like no other,

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.885
unimaginable pressure.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.731
Every one of these folks
was tortured and died

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.090
for what they claimed to see, and none
of them ever recanted their story.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.727
So, the idea that this is a
conspiracy in the 1 st century

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.410
is just really unreasonable.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.090
Instead, what I see in the gospels

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.488
is something I call unintended
eyewitness support statement.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.001
What's an unintended
eyewitness support statement?

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.009
If I can borrow your Bible?

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.885
Let me go to the Gospel of Matthew

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.166
for an example of this.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.805
I'll start with a passage

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.531
in which Jesus is in front
of Caiaphas at a hearing.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.563
It says here, "Then they spit in his face

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:10.489
"and struck him with their fists.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.045
"Others slapped him and said,

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.447
'Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"'

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.244
Now, that seems like
a very simple request,

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.936
given that the people who hit him
are standing right in front of him.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.530
This makes no sense.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.291
Why would it be prophecy to be
able to tell you who hit you?

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.091
But it's not until you read Luke
that you get an answer to this.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.931
He says, "The men who were guarding Jesus

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.088
"began mocking and beating him.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.083
"They blindfolded him and demanded,

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.526
'Prophesy, who hit you?"'

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.608
So, now we know why this was a challenge,

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.696
'cause Luke tells us the
thing that Matthew left out,

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.056
that he was actually blindfolded
at the time this took place.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.568
This is very common, this kind of
unintentional eyewitness support

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.968
that fills in a detail
that the first witness left out.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.686
After years of scrutinizing
these gospels using the template

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.571
that I use to determine
if an eyewitness is reliable,

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.326
I concluded that the
four gospels in this book

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.729
contained the reliable accounts
of the actual words of Jesus.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.728
And that's to include the statements
quoted by Ms. Wesley in her class?

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.129
Absolutely.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:13.886
Thank you, Detective.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.402
Your witness.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.648
Detective Wallace,

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.641
I'm not gonna try to match
biblical knowledge with you.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.287
But isn't it true that these
gospel accounts vary widely

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.163
in what they say, that there are numerous
discrepancies between these accounts?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.285
Absolutely, but that's
exactly what we should expect.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.607
I don't quite understand that.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.136
Well, reliable eyewitness
accounts always differ slightly

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.296
in the way they recall the story.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.326
They're coming to it from different
geographic perspectives, their history,

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.084
even where they are located in the room.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.441
When I examined the gospels,
I was trying to determine

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.642
if these were accurate, reliable accounts,

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.528
in spite of any differences
there might be between the accounts.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.285
Ah, and as a devout Christian,
you feel you succeeded?

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.925
Ah, Mr. Kane.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.525
I think you misunderstand me.

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.405
When I began this study,
I was a devout atheist.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.683
I began examining the gospels
as a committed skeptic,

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.928
not as a believer.

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.520
You see, I wasn't raised
in a Christian environment,

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.370
although I do think I have an unusually
high regard for the value of evidence.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.400
I'm not a Christian
because I was raised that way

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.683
or because I hoped it would satisfy
some need or accomplish some goal.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.247
I'm simply a Christian
because it's evidentially true.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.130
Motion to strike, Your Honor.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.049
Granted.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.245
Jury's instructed to ignore
Detective Wallace's last remark.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.249
No further questions.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.124
Witness is excused.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.969
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.889
Mr. Endler, your next witness.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.129
We don't have one, Your Honor.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.616
She didn't do anything wrong;
She was just trying to help me!

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.449
Brooke!

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.130
Order! I'll have order!

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.206
Young lady, your youth is no excuse
for disturbing the sanctity of this court.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.288
But this case is supposed to be about me.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.405
I'm almost 17 years old;
It's not like I can't think for myself.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.249
I just don't have the right to speak.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.496
- Brooke, what are you doing?
- Not unless you are called

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.045
as a witness, young lady.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.811
If I put her on the stand,
what am I gonna hear?

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.048
That she asked a question
and I answered it.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.683
Your Honor, we'd like to call
Ms. Brooke Thawley to the stand.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.211
Objection, Your Honor!

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.924
Ms. Thawley is a minor.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:35.525
Her parents do not want her subjected
to the emotional pressure

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.120
of testifying against her own teacher.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.450
Ms. Thawley, are you willing
to testify on your own behalf?

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.800
Yes, Your Honor.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.201
And do you understand
that you will have to answer

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.323
all the questions truthfully,
regardless of your feelings,

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.724
and that failure to do so
is punishable by law?

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.001
Yes, Your Honor.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.565
I'm not afraid of telling the truth.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.048
I'm only afraid
of not being able to tell it.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.925
I will allow this witness.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.884
Objection overruled.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.930
Brooke, in class, who first
brought up the name "Jesus,"

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.326
you or Ms. Wesley?

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.771
I did.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.291
As part of a question?

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.765
Yes.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.530
And at that time, did you feel like you
were asking a faith-based question?

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.085
No, not really.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.362
It just seemed like
Martin Luther King and Jesus

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.723
were saying similar things,
so I brought it up.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.808
And did you consider
Ms. Wesley's response

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.969
to be a reasonable answer
to your question?

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.690
Yes.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.201
So, if I'm hearing you correctly,

01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.248
you asked a question in history
class about a historical figure,

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.847
and your history teacher answered it
in a sensible manner?

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.928
Yes.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.891
Thank you.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.207
Your witness.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:26.206
Ms. Thawley, do you like Ms. Wesley?

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.890
Yes.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.207
Would you say she's
your favorite teacher?

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.049
Yes, absolutely.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.889
Do you think Ms. Wesley likes you?

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.247
Objection, speculative.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.164
Your Honor, speaks to the state of mind
of the witness, if not Ms. Wesley herself.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.169
I'm gonna allow it. Overruled.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.886
You may answer the question.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.843
Yes, I think she likes me.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.325
Uh-huh.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.531
Do you think there's any possibility
that in answering your question,

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.441
she may have tried to share
some of the ideas of her faith,

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.881
a faith that she holds most dear?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.321
No, uh, no, not at that moment.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.488
Not at that moment.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.360
You mean to say that
there were other moments

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.489
in which she talked to you
about her faith?

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.488
Hmm? Ms. Thawley, please?

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.649
You must answer
the question, Ms. Thawley.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.245
Yes, but it was outside of school
and it was only one time.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.442
Move to strike.
Your Honor, this is irrelevant.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.961
No actions off the school
campus are at issue here.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.491
Denied.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.369
Mr. Kane seems to have
found a loose thread.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.528
I'm inclined to let him pull it.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.563
See what unravels.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.920
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.644
Why didn't you tell me about this?

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.207
You didn't ask,
and I didn't think it mattered.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.569
Brooke, you realize that
you have to tell the truth here.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.841
You understand that, correct?

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.405
Yes.

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:53.249
So, what did you mean when you said

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.685
that you had talks
about faith outside of school?

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.969
My brother died in an accident
6 months ago.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.401
Ms. Wesley noticed that
I wasn't doing so well,

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.444
so she asked me if everything
was all right after class.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.368
Mm-hmm.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.528
I told her I was fine, but I went
and found her later on at the coffee shop.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.007
And did Ms. Wesley refer you

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:25.489
to any kind of psychological counseling?

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.523
No.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.325
Did she suggest that perhaps

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.082
she wasn't the right person
to be discussing this with you?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.884
No.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.088
Well, then what did Ms. Wesley do?

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.009
She was really nice.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:46.008
We talked for a long time
and I could tell that she really cared.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.724
Mm.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.849
I asked her how she kept it all together
so well, and she said, "Jesus."

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.531
So, she's the one
who brought up Jesus?

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.360
Did her endorsement of Jesus
move you to explore Christianity?

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:01.204
Yes, at first.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.690
But when the Salvation Army came
to pick up my brother's things,

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.682
one of the ladies found his
Bible, and she gave it to me.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.882
I didn't even know that he had one.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.445
Mm.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.007
So, I started reading it,
and once I started,

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:25.286
I realized that I didn't wanna stop.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.164
That's why.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.921
That's why I came up with the
question that I asked in class.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.611
Now, if I understand you correctly,

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.128
without Ms. Wesley's direct involvement,

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.683
you never would've asked that question
in the first place, would you?

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.325
I don't know.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.007
After all of your Bible readings,

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.843
do you feel now that you're a believer?

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.849
Yes.

01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.729
Maybe even a Christian?

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.208
Yes.

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.402
At the risk of seeming redundant,

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.091
do you think any of this,
the Bible readings,

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.000
the question about Jesus in class,

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.691
the newfound commitment to Christianity,

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.168
is it likely that any of that
would've occurred

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.286
without Ms. Wesley's direct involvement?

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.724
No, it wouldn't.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.287
I thank you for your honesty.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.767
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.202
Mr. Endler,
do you wish to redirect?

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.766
No, Your Honor.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:43.770
You may step down, Ms. Thawley.

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.447
Why do they look so angry?

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.409
Because they think we lied to them.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.848
But we didn't.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.531
It doesn't matter.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.722
This court is adjourned.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.165
I have to prepare you, Grace.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.888
We're gonna lose this case.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.884
I know.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.168
You were right.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.366
I'm gonna lose everything.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.805
We saw a very large crowd
out here at the courthouse yesterday,

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.890
both in protest and
support of teacher Grace Wesley,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.402
who is on trial for allegedly
proselytizing at the classroom.

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.924
Now, in an unexpected move yesterday,
we saw some of Wesley's former students

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.688
come out to silently demonstrate
their support for their teacher.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.961
Oh Father, please take this from me.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:38.484
I don't know what to do.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.366
Please don't forsake me.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.404
Please.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.290
Hey, Brooke.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.681
I ruined everything, didn't I?

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.167
It's okay, you don't have to answer.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.800
I know that I did.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.400
I'm not even allowed to talk to her.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.645
How do I let her know that I'm sorry
without making things worse?

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.922
I can't tell you what to do,

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:35.361
but whatever you do,
just let her know you care.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.730
Recently, when I've been praying,

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.411
it's like Jesus isn't letting me
feel his presence.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.251
Usually I can almost
reach out and touch him,

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:55.360
but right now it's like
he's a million miles away.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.049
Honey, you of all people should realize

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.891
when you're going through
something really hard,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.325
the teacher is always quiet
during the test.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.644
First of all,
this trial took an unexpected turn

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:12.126
when Wesley's counsel decided they'd
try to prove the existence of Jesus.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.402
Gary, this is kind of
your area of expertise.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.921
How do you convince the skeptics?

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.971
Well, Governor, I employ what
I call the minimal facts method,

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.481
which uses only the historical events

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.448
that are so well evidenced
that they're accepted across the board,

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.564
even by skeptical
and non-Christian scholars.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:31.846
As a result, we...

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.283
Now I understand what it is
you weren't allowed to talk about.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.882
I wish I still wasn't
allowed to talk about it.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.287
She needs me on that jury.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.885
Have faith, David.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.923
God's plan is at work.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.849
How'd you get here anyway?

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.525
I borrowed your Prius.
It's very nice.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.728
Don't get too comfortable.
I'm planning a full recovery.

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.566
So, Rice, do you believe that she
was proselytizing to her students?

01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:57.091
Governor, not at all.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.130
Jesus Christ was the most
influential person who ever lived.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.163
How could you ignore
that fact and teach history?

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.651
I think the real problem is...

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.410
Hey, Martin!

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.885
More questions?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.496
I wanted to make sure that you were okay.

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.124
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.096
They're just holding me
over for a little observation.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.521
I'll be released soon.

01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.250
Something different about you.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.771
Are you okay?

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.484
I should say so.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.602
Yes.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.484
I believe God wants me to be a minister,

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.728
to return to my country
and become a pastor,

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.080
just like you.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.690
That's great.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.928
There'll be challenges
in your country.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.520
Are you prepared for them?

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.968
I am.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.531
I'm proud of you.

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.051
Come here.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.725
That's awesome.

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.566
It's a shocking reality
that Christians are soon gonna be forced

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.927
to choose between obeying the law
of man or following the Word of God.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.485
I'm Mike Huckabee.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.369
We'll see you next time
on "Point of View."

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.376
Hey, Brooke, why don't you
go be with Ms. Wesley.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.209
I think we can handle this.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.209
Yeah, seriously,
we've got backup coming.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.164
You're covered.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.084
Go get 'em.

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.280
God's got this.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.927
Where's Tom?

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.884
All rise.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.882
Be seated.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.651
Are we missing someone?

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.970
Sorry, Your Honor.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.923
My apologies to the court.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.209
That's unexpected.

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.482
He almost looks like a lawyer.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:06.123
Your Honor, I have
one final witness to call.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.369
Grace Wesley.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.481
Ms. Wesley,
please approach the witness stand.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.489
Do I have to?

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.568
I'm afraid so.

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.806
Your Honor, given the
witness's reluctance to testify,

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.091
can I have the court's permission
to treat her as a hostile witness?

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.524
You may. Proceed at your own peril.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.961
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.161
I do.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.691
Please be seated.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.487
Grace, I want you
to do something for me,

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.285
something for everyone in this courtroom.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.522
I want you to apologize.

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.405
I want you to say you're sorry
and that you made a mistake.

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.816
Your Honor, what's going on here?

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.241
Do it, Grace.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.850
I can't do that.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.883
Why? Why can't you do that, Grace?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.526
Because I don't believe
I did anything wrong.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:11.167
Well, as your attorney, I'm
advising you to do it anyway.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.407
To at least pretend that you're sorry and
throw yourself on the mercy of the court.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.567
What?

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.091
That would be a lie.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.486
So what?

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.965
Everyone lies.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.491
Not everyone.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.080
Are you looking to become a martyr?

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.043
What in the world is he doing?

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.730
I have no idea.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.727
No.

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.205
Tommy...

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.049
Then what is it that you want, Grace?

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:36.369
Tell me. Tell us.

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.845
I want...

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.890
I want to be able to tell the truth.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.446
The truth?

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.891
Whose truth?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.527
And what truth are you referring to?

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:55.407
Grace, is there some truth that
you know that no one else knows?

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.885
Oh, that's right.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.241
The other night, didn't you tell me
that Jesus spoke to you personally?

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.850
Why are you doing this?

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.576
I'm the one asking
the questions, Ms. Wesley.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.090
Did you or did you not tell me

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.250
that Jesus spoke to you personally?

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.806
Yes.

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.207
And what did he say?

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.089
I'll make it easier for you.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.806
Didn't you say that he
asked you a question?

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.656
That was personal.
You weren't supposed to...

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.330
I don't care.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.616
The other night, you told me
that Jesus asked you something.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:30.290
What did he ask you, Grace?

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.811
Tell all of us.

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.331
I think we deserve to know.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.044
Why are you doing this to me?

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.525
Answer the question.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:38.210
They won't believe me.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.243
Doesn't matter.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.446
All that matters is that you believe it.

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.723
Tell us, Grace, under penalty of perjury,

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:51.764
what was the question that God
presented to you personally

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.327
that night on campus?

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.801
Answer the question.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.082
Answer the question!

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:15.290
He asked, "Who do you say that I am?"

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.962
And what did you answer?

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:27.246
You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.885
Well, there you have it.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.890
Your Honor, I think we've
all heard quite enough.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.881
Mr. Endler, are you
looking to change your client's plea?

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.809
No, Your Honor.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.048
I say she's innocent of all wrongdoing.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.403
But I'm asking the jury
to find against her anyway.

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.204
I mean, let's, let's face it.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.291
She has the audacity to believe
not only that there is a God,

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:56.801
but that she has a personal
relationship with Him,

01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:00.367
which colors everything
that she says and does.

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:04.168
I think it's time that we stop pretending
that we can trust a person like this

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:06.328
to serve in a public capacity.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:09.922
In the name of tolerance
and diversity, I say we destroy her.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.326
That's enough, Mr. Endler.

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.169
Then we can all go to our graves content,

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.328
knowing that we stomped out
the last spark of faith

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.200
that was ever exhibited
in the public square.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:19.606
That's enough, Mr. Endler.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.776
I say we make an example of her.

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:22.609
Mr. Endler, that's enough.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.966
Let's set a new precedent, that employment
by our federal government mandates

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.731
that you must first denounce
any belief system you have.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.616
Mr. Endler that is enough!
You are out of order.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.369
And if someone slips through the cracks

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.769
and hides their beliefs,
then we arrest them and fine them.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.856
And if they don't pay,
then we seize their property.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.211
And if they resist...

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.045
Well, let's not kid ourselves.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.003
Enforcement is always at the end of a gun.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.884
Mr. Endler, you are out of order.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.331
I charge you with contempt!

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:53.771
I accept the charge, because I have
nothing but contempt for these proceedings.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.770
If we're going to insist that
a Christian's right to believe

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:00.962
is subordinate to all other rights,
then it's not a right.

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.686
Somebody is always going to be offended.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.690
Two thousand years of
human history proves that.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.484
So, I say we get on with it.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.922
Cite the law, charge the jury,
and send them off to deliberate.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:14.008
So be it!

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.441
Now, we are gonna bypass
the usual closing arguments,

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:24.962
unless Mr. Kane finds the need
to further address the jury.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.969
No, Your Honor.

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.367
We can ask nothing more.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.371
My instructions to you are simple.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.804
Uphold the law without unfairly
prejudicing your decision

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:42.528
or risking a mistrial on appeal.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.522
Now, I believe I can safely say
that the respondent's counsel

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:53.726
has dared you to convict his own client.

01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:01.480
The jury will now be
dismissed for deliberation.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.729
We are adjourned.

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.401
She hasn't got a prayer.

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.851
Let's go.

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.931
Remind me to send him a thank-you note.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.289
Thank you so much.
Thank you, guys.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.731
Thanks for coming out.

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.922
Hey, right now on the phone,
a friend of mine named Amy is on the line,

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.602
and she's calling about a woman
who's on trial for her faith.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:43.163
This woman has risked
everything for Jesus.

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:45.851
Amy's asked me to pray for this woman.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.928
Will you guys join me?

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.203
Lord, we know that
to risk anything for you

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.490
is a complete honor with eternal rewards.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.568
But if it's within your will,

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.810
can you please restore this woman's hope

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.131
and make her faith
an example to all of us?

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.369
Lord, show your power to a fallen world.

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.327
We know you have the power to do anything.

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.331
So, we ask you right now, crying
out as the body of Christ,

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.328
move those hearts of those people,
both the judge and the jury,

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:27.843
to let them know the
beauty of your majesty.

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.851
And we all said amen.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.200
Amen.

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:08.248
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, have you reached a decision?

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.648
We have, Your Honor.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.970
And how do you find?

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:30.249
We, the jury, find in favor
of Grace Wesley.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.520
We are adjourned.

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:03.489
Nice shoes.

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.641
Grace, I'm sorry.

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:29.807
I couldn't tell you.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:31.684
It had to come as a surprise,

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.485
otherwise the jury wouldn't have
been swayed by your reactions.

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.400
So, you did have a plan.

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.967
No, you did.

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.683
You stood up for what you believed in
and you held on to your faith.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:48.963
I don't know anybody
that would have done that.

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.726
They were hoping to
make an example of you,

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:57.961
but instead you became an inspiration.

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.048
We did it!

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.243
Hey, you've kept quiet long enough.

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.762
Why don't you go share the good news?

01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:15.004
Hey, thank you.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:35.767

You have the right

You have a right to an attorney.

one will be provided for you.

Looks like I'm gonna need you to fill
in for me a little while longer.

Of course, David, anything you need.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.651
What do we do now?

02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:24.410
Same as always, Martin.
