12:45.939 --> 12:49.709
Does that mean
you're gonna have to go?

12:53.097 --> 12:55.614
Where will you stay?

12:55.666 --> 12:58.835
Maybe in that tent.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.455
Sounds like
a pretty good idea.

13:12.466 --> 13:13.599
Morning, Tree Hill.

13:13.650 --> 13:14.934
It's a sunshiny day,

13:15.002 --> 13:17.470
and we've got a very special
treat for you.

13:17.538 --> 13:20.356
And by "treat," I <i>don't</i> mean
15-minute casseroles.

13:20.441 --> 13:21.858
But don't worry.

13:21.942 --> 13:23.409
You can catch
<i>that</i> segment,

13:23.477 --> 13:25.278
along with some easy recipes,
online.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.196
But who cares
about casserole

13:27.281 --> 13:29.532
when we get to talk
to the person responsible

13:29.616 --> 13:32.752
for some of Hollywood's
most exciting sports sequences.

13:32.819 --> 13:36.155
Please welcome our dear friend
Antwon Taylor.

13:45.516 --> 13:47.600
So, now, Antwon, now,
you've just returned

13:47.667 --> 13:49.519
from working
on a big basketball movie.

13:49.603 --> 13:53.940
Why don't you tell everybody
a little bit about what you do?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.508
Okay, well,
I'm a sports choreographer.

13:55.559 --> 13:57.393
And basically what I do is,

13:57.478 --> 13:58.844
I come up with all the plays
that look good on film.

13:58.896 --> 14:00.980
People say that
I'm the Mike McCarthy

14:01.031 --> 14:04.067
or Phil Jackson of all
the sports scenes in movies.

14:04.151 --> 14:05.284
People say that?

14:05.352 --> 14:07.186
No.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.789
Antwon, you must have to be
in really good shape.

14:09.856 --> 14:11.857
Yeah, I mean,
it helps to be, because I...

14:11.909 --> 14:13.692
He's not a personal trainer.
He's a choreographer.

14:13.744 --> 14:15.628
Oh, yeah, that's right.

14:15.695 --> 14:17.163
But you must have to
work out a ton

14:17.214 --> 14:18.798
so that you can demonstrate
for your actors

14:18.865 --> 14:20.199
what you need them
to do.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.467
Yeah.

14:21.535 --> 14:22.835
He just needs to know
the sport, Millie.

14:22.886 --> 14:26.372
I'm only suggesting
he's in good shape, Marvin.

14:26.423 --> 14:28.174
And nobody's disagreeing
with you, Millie,

14:28.225 --> 14:29.642
but it's not what
we were talking about.

14:31.311 --> 14:34.147
I think what we're talking about
is your weight.

14:34.214 --> 14:36.682
Millie said her viewers
did agree with her that,

14:36.733 --> 14:38.484
uh, you could shed
a few pounds.

14:38.552 --> 14:39.902
Well,
that's <i>her</i> fan base.

14:39.987 --> 14:41.487
My fan base disagrees.

14:41.555 --> 14:42.572
Yeah, you know what,
Millie?

14:42.656 --> 14:43.739
That <i>was</i>
<i>kind of messed up...</i>

14:43.824 --> 14:45.658
How you called your boy fat
on TV.

14:45.725 --> 14:47.527
I mean, how would you feel
if you became hungry hippo

14:47.578 --> 14:50.663
and mouth called you out
on a TV show?

14:50.730 --> 14:52.665
I'm thinking pretty bad.

14:52.732 --> 14:55.067
Plus, you know,
mouth would get fired

14:55.119 --> 14:56.419
if he ever called you fat.

14:56.503 --> 14:57.687
'Cause people would lose
they minds.

14:57.754 --> 14:59.238
I'm just saying.

15:01.341 --> 15:05.344
So... what else is going on
besides mouth getting fat?

15:09.916 --> 15:11.250
Yo!

15:11.301 --> 15:14.020
Whoo!

15:14.087 --> 15:16.189
So, did you wear her ass out
or what?

15:16.256 --> 15:18.691
Stop talking, <i>please.</i>

15:18.758 --> 15:21.594
Come on!
Chris Keller needs visuals.

15:21.645 --> 15:23.262
What was her name?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.363
"Not Alex."

15:24.431 --> 15:28.451
Dude, you got
to let that go, man.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.102
No, she's... never mind.

15:30.154 --> 15:33.105
I can't remember anything
that happened.

15:33.157 --> 15:34.657
Classy.

15:34.741 --> 15:36.159
Yeah.

15:36.243 --> 15:38.277
I was hoping you'd be able
to tell me something.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.963
- Can't.
- Chris Keller crashed early.

15:41.048 --> 15:44.617
But you did text me that
you love me like a brother

15:44.668 --> 15:46.952
and that you met a girl
who was like an exotic flower

15:47.004 --> 15:49.955
in a cluster of blue-moon,

15:50.007 --> 15:52.308
ice-cream-colored
carnations.

15:54.895 --> 15:56.729
Like I could
make that up.

15:56.796 --> 15:59.298
Dude, please tell me
you got her number.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.984
Yeah.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.404
Boom!

16:05.472 --> 16:07.440
Can you call her?
Just hit her up, please.

16:07.491 --> 16:08.858
I want to meet
this exotic flower.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.531
Okay. Okay.

16:15.616 --> 16:18.150
Well, Chris Keller's
gonna go, then.

16:18.202 --> 16:21.204
I got platinum
to produce.

16:34.718 --> 16:36.636
Yeah.

16:36.687 --> 16:37.803
Yeah.

16:37.854 --> 16:39.805
Dimitri,
I got it, all right?

16:45.579 --> 16:48.531
My grandkids
play in this park.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.651
Yeah, let me guess...
The two ugly kids.

16:53.670 --> 16:56.956
You had a run-in with my family
last night...

16:57.023 --> 16:59.208
The girl
and her boyfriend.

16:59.276 --> 17:03.045
Yeah, well, you know all kinds
of losers, don't you?

17:03.130 --> 17:04.914
Why don't you get up, man?

17:04.998 --> 17:08.568
You ever check out that park
in Pickerington?

17:08.635 --> 17:09.867
No.
You should.

17:11.637 --> 17:13.573
That's not a suggestion.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.810
Look.

17:17.877 --> 17:22.881
The people I roll with...
They could erase you, man.

17:22.933 --> 17:25.067
Yeah, maybe.

17:25.152 --> 17:27.569
But before they do,
you'll be dead.

17:27.654 --> 17:30.022
Is that a threat?!

17:30.073 --> 17:31.240
'Cause I don't do so good
with threats!

17:31.325 --> 17:32.224
Get up.
Relax.

17:32.276 --> 17:33.743
It's not a threat...

17:33.827 --> 17:35.394
It's a promise.

17:37.614 --> 17:40.065
If I catch you
near my family again,

17:40.117 --> 17:41.033
I'll kill you.

17:53.013 --> 17:55.381
It could have been
really bad, Haley.

17:55.432 --> 17:58.801
If nobody had noticed Davis,
it could have been <i>really</i> bad.

17:58.885 --> 18:00.770
You know,
I understand...

18:00.854 --> 18:02.888
Forgetting your phone
or your keys

18:02.939 --> 18:05.308
or forgetting to turn off
the curling iron,

18:05.392 --> 18:06.559
but your own baby?

18:06.610 --> 18:08.611
Who depends on you
for everything?

18:08.695 --> 18:10.763
Brooke, the important thing
to remember

18:10.814 --> 18:13.482
is that Davis
<i>is</i> okay.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.101
He looks like he's <i>more</i>
<i>than okay.</i>

18:16.153 --> 18:17.936
I know.

18:17.988 --> 18:19.772
I know.

18:19.823 --> 18:23.108
Hey, can I ask
why Dan has been around?

18:23.160 --> 18:25.378
I mean, isn't Nathan
gonna be <i>really</i> mad?

18:25.445 --> 18:26.445
Yeah, it's just...

18:26.496 --> 18:27.580
It's temporary.

18:27.631 --> 18:29.281
He... he needed help
for a little while.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.167
I

18:31.251 --> 18:36.305
We're gonna have to so <i>something</i>
<i>about that stupid sign.</i>

19:18.729 --> 19:20.513
I would hate to be that stack.

19:20.564 --> 19:22.765
We're doing a segment
called "perfect pancakes,"

19:22.850 --> 19:24.684
and I heard this place
can serve them up.

19:24.735 --> 19:26.019
Mm-hmm.

19:26.070 --> 19:27.487
Dude,
the ratings are huge.

19:27.554 --> 19:29.238
I have a responsibility
to the show...

19:29.323 --> 19:30.389
To my fans, you know?

19:30.441 --> 19:32.492
We got to keep
the ratings big.

19:32.559 --> 19:34.060
Yeah, well, you keep on
buttering that stack like that,

19:34.111 --> 19:35.194
you're gonna be bigger
than the ratings.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.447
Look,
let me ask you a question.

19:37.531 --> 19:40.283
How is it that you can leave
your job in Omaha for Millie,

19:40.367 --> 19:42.435
but you can't take care
of your health for her?

19:42.503 --> 19:43.336
It's not fair.

19:48.425 --> 19:50.276
Seriously?

19:50.344 --> 19:52.411
Um, the food was free?

19:52.463 --> 19:53.680
That's part of the problem
right there.

19:54.948 --> 19:56.966
I just... not now.

19:57.051 --> 19:58.601
Excuse me. I...

19:58.686 --> 20:00.019
Welcome to Tree Hill café.

20:00.087 --> 20:01.354
I'll be happy to help you
in one sec.

20:01.422 --> 20:02.922
If you could just
hop in line.

20:02.973 --> 20:05.058
Mm.

20:05.109 --> 20:07.360
I <i>cannot</i> believe
those two.

20:07.427 --> 20:09.979
Have they never heard
of loyalty?

20:11.598 --> 20:12.565
Hi, ladies!
What can I get for you?

20:12.616 --> 20:14.067
Hi.

20:14.118 --> 20:15.768
I was wondering if you could
remove the slanderous sign

20:15.819 --> 20:16.903
that's hanging
outside of your building.

20:18.438 --> 20:21.124
The one that says
"Karen's café hires murderers."

20:21.208 --> 20:23.376
I can't.
The owner wanted it up.

20:23.443 --> 20:25.378
Listen...
I've had a really bad week,

20:25.445 --> 20:27.497
and I'm a little thin
on patience,

20:27.581 --> 20:29.799
so either you go take
that sign down,

20:29.883 --> 20:31.000
or I'm gonna climb
up there,

20:31.085 --> 20:32.835
rip it down,
and shove it up your owner's...

20:32.920 --> 20:34.504
Okay, I would really appreciate
it if you could tell your owner

20:34.588 --> 20:35.638
that we'll be in touch.

20:35.723 --> 20:37.807
Sure.

you might think so...

you should admit yourself...

30:46.908 --> 30:51.027
Until we get a handle
on this.

30:51.079 --> 30:52.879

about stuff.

than that.

30:58.469 --> 31:00.870
Admittance is voluntary,
of course,

31:00.922 --> 31:03.039
but with
prolonged blackouts,

31:03.091 --> 31:04.925

environment.

31:06.928 --> 31:09.546

stay here, Clay,

31:09.597 --> 31:11.815

we <i>will</i> fix this.

31:37.908 --> 31:41.128
How am I gonna trust him
with them again?

31:41.212 --> 31:43.213
You trust him because...

31:43.264 --> 31:44.631
He's a <i>great</i> father

31:44.715 --> 31:46.600
and he's a great husband

31:46.684 --> 31:50.470
and he's
your best friend.

31:50.555 --> 31:54.925
He loves you and these boys
more than anything.

31:54.992 --> 31:59.312

especially now.

31:59.397 --> 32:02.816
