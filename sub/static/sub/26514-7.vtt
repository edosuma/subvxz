WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.742
Previously onDynasty...Life is too short

00:03.786 --> 00:05.048
to wait for what you want.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.355
Marry me.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.747
FALLON:
I can't do this anymore.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.010
I love Culhane.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.489
I'm sorry, Liam, but it's over.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.970
ANDERS:
I'd like you

00:14.014 --> 00:15.537
to come and live here.Really?

00:15.580 --> 00:16.712
I'd like that.

00:16.755 --> 00:17.974
That recording of Jeff

00:18.018 --> 00:19.149
running an illegal card game

00:19.193 --> 00:21.499
in his innocent sister's club

00:21.543 --> 00:22.848
is my insurance you'll behave.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.198
Leave Monica out of this.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.330
I'm not the one who put
her club in my sights.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.592
For you, Sam.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.508
This card means new life.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.728
HANK: You'll never
have to see me again.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
I'm taking the money,
and I'm hitting the road

00:34.121 --> 00:36.079
like a lonesome wolf.
It's been a pleasure.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.001
ALEXIS:
Hold on, I'm coming!

00:47.221 --> 00:49.745
Randy, uh, did something happen
at the loft?

00:49.788 --> 00:51.007
We were supposed to meet
at 9:00?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.226
To go over the final punch list.

00:52.269 --> 00:56.012
Oh, what time is it now?It's 11:30.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.145
Look, I can come in now if...

00:58.188 --> 01:00.234
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had a...

01:00.277 --> 01:02.758
A guest. Yes,
it's been a very long night.

01:02.801 --> 01:05.065
Uh, just give me 30 minutes,
and I'll freshen up.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.462
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.029
No, no, no, no, none of that.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.684
You've got to be
very, very quiet.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.860
Yeah, that's it. Shh, shh, shh.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.992
HANK: You've reached Hank.
I mean, you haven't,

01:20.036 --> 01:21.385
because I can't come
to the phone,

01:21.429 --> 01:23.648
but you've reached
my voice mail and...

01:23.692 --> 01:25.302
Where are you, Hank?

01:25.346 --> 01:27.043
I don't know who the hell
this Claudia is

01:27.087 --> 01:28.697
or why I have her baby,

01:28.740 --> 01:31.134
but you need to come
and get it right now!

01:31.178 --> 01:34.268
Shh, shh. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. I'm trying, okay?

01:34.311 --> 01:35.573
I need you to work with me.

01:35.617 --> 01:38.446
Shh.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.926
Look, I don't want to get
the authorities involved, Hank.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.885
But if they trace this baby
to you,

01:42.928 --> 01:46.106
they trace you to me,
and we both end up in handcuffs.

01:46.149 --> 01:49.152
I can't take care
of this infant.

01:49.196 --> 01:52.677
Oh, is this how people
without night nurses live?

01:52.721 --> 01:55.680
Oh, God.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.860
You still want to get married?

02:01.904 --> 02:04.559
And do that every morning?

02:04.602 --> 02:06.648
I'm in.

02:10.434 --> 02:13.220
Let's get a ring
on that finger.

02:13.263 --> 02:16.440
I want the whole world
to know you're mine.

02:16.484 --> 02:19.356
Maybe we should start
with the whole family?

02:20.792 --> 02:22.359
FALLON:
What are we waiting for?

02:22.403 --> 02:24.231
Doesn't Dad know
we all have things to do?

02:24.274 --> 02:26.189
Yeah, I have a massage in 30.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.191
The first
of the Christmas decorations

02:28.235 --> 02:29.410
will be here in a few minutes.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.585
It's a little early, isn't it?

02:30.628 --> 02:31.586
Thanksgiving's over.

02:31.629 --> 02:32.804
What's this even about?

02:32.848 --> 02:35.329
Maybe a Welcome Wagon
for your new neighbor?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.331
Me.

02:37.374 --> 02:40.551
Oh, finally. Oh.

02:40.595 --> 02:41.987
What's going on here?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.946
Those bags under your eyes
are impressive, Alexis.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.904
Not getting enough rest out
in that tin can of yours?

02:46.905 --> 02:48.080
Kirby, that's enough.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.082
Definitely a welcome addition.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.736
I really can't stay.
I have things to do.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.044
Good, you're all here. I
hope you all got champagne.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.264
We have news to celebrate.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.483
Last night I asked
Cristal to marry me.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.572
And she said yes.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.226
What

03:03.270 --> 03:04.227
Is she pregnant?

03:04.271 --> 03:05.446
SAM:
Oh, my God.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.969
What if that's the
baby the psychic meant

03:07.012 --> 03:09.276
and I just wanted to
believe it was for me?

03:09.319 --> 03:11.365
I'm not pregnant.Thank God for that.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.236
This is not some shotgun
wedding, although...

03:13.280 --> 03:15.238
I wouldn't mind a few little
feet running around here.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.239
Oh...

03:16.283 --> 03:17.240
Then what's the rush?

03:17.284 --> 03:18.546
I mean, the last one's
barely cold.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
Seriously, Fallon.BLAKE:
There's no rush.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.376
I promise, your
wedding will be first.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.638
That's not what I meant.

03:23.681 --> 03:24.900
If there's anything the
last year taught me,

03:24.943 --> 03:26.380
it's that life is precious.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.946
And short.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.731
And I'm not gonna waste
any of it.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.994
It's time for a new chapter
around here.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.827
KIRBY:
Guess that means

03:38.870 --> 03:40.263
yours is officially closing.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.396
Too bad.
It's been a real page-turner.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.615
ANDERS:
Not even a comment

03:44.659 --> 03:46.530
about the latest
Mrs. Carrington?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.619
You must be in a hurry.Clearly, I'm not the only one.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.231
But I have more
pressing concerns right now.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.059
Blake's whims tend
to work themselves out.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.757
Until he reproduces with them.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288
Already?

04:05.332 --> 04:07.290
Well, how tacky.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.311
Van Kirk Industries, huh?

04:28.355 --> 04:31.314
Oh, I was just catching up

04:31.358 --> 04:33.229
on some news.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.622
You hang onto some shares
in the C.A. sale,

04:34.665 --> 04:36.101
or just keeping tabs on Liam?

04:36.145 --> 04:38.060
Well, just because I sold
the company

04:38.103 --> 04:39.496
doesn't mean I forgot about it.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.193
And it's still a part
of my family's legacy.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.326
Someone has to care,
and it's clearly not my dad.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.241
Well, maybe he has
the right idea.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.330
Seriously? I mean,
he's known this Cristal

04:47.374 --> 04:48.766
even shorter than the last one.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.986
There's something to be said
for seizing the moment.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.335
You know what,

04:52.379 --> 04:53.902
and he still said
that we could go first.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.165
Okay, well, I'm not having
my wedding date dictated

04:56.208 --> 04:58.341
by my dad's whims.
Been there, done that.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.344
So what do you want to do?
Not get married?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.954
No, no.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.392
I just want to do it
on my own terms. Ourterms.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.655
But right now I have to go.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.744
I'm having lunch with Monica.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.399
Bye.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.444
Bye.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.882
JEFF:
There you are.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.102
My guys want to know if we're on
for the game Tuesday.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.496
Yeah, we're good.

05:22.539 --> 05:25.412
All right.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.197
You are an angel
for helping me.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.547
I just can't decide
on this accent wall,

05:30.591 --> 05:32.462
and you have got
such a great eye.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.117
Mm-hmm. Just as long
as I don't have to paint it.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.424
Olga just worked the knots
out of my shoulder.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.426
What's that?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.384
Is that a baby?

05:41.428 --> 05:44.474
Sound effects? A little extra.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.129
Oh, my God.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.655
It's real.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.657
You must be joking.Hey, buddy.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.486
Where'd you come from?
You're okay. Shh, shh, shh.

05:56.530 --> 06:00.055
You're good, buddy. Hey.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.710
Oh, look, there's a note.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.712
"I deserve more

06:04.755 --> 06:06.670
"than my mother can give.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.368
Please take good care of me."

06:08.411 --> 06:10.239
Oh, my God.FALLON:
What the hell is that?

06:10.282 --> 06:11.458
What's what?ALEXIS:
Sam found

06:11.501 --> 06:13.460
a baby in the manger.Whose baby?

06:13.503 --> 06:15.026
What baby?

06:15.070 --> 06:17.594
Oh, sweet Mary and Joseph.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.031
♪ Hallelujah.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.077
♪

06:45.492 --> 06:48.364
Who would leave a baby
in the driveway?I'll canvass the staff,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.627
see if anyone's misplaced
their offspring.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.977
Maybe we should call the police.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.501
I just got off the phone
with Child Services.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.546
What? You read the note.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.243
Well, we don't know who
wrote the note, Sam.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.549
What if somebody took him?

06:59.593 --> 07:01.116
Like they did Adam.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.292
Well, they had no
missing children reported,

07:03.335 --> 07:04.511
so they said
they'd send somebody

07:04.554 --> 07:05.990
as soon as they
can, but you know

07:06.034 --> 07:08.297
how underfunded these agencies
are. It could take days.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.605
Days? What are we supposed to do
with it until then

07:11.648 --> 07:13.781
He's better off here
than in some orphanage.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.217
They have foster homes.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.524
No one's gonna take better care
of him than we are.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.655
I think God

07:18.699 --> 07:21.179
put him here for me to find.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.181
You'd think God
would know better.SAM: I'm serious.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.227
I've been praying for a baby,

07:25.270 --> 07:26.446
and he needs a family.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.186
It's like a textbook miracle.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.449
Let's not get carried away.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.711
Well, he's probably
better off here

07:30.754 --> 07:31.625
than in a foster home.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.843
And he does even look

07:32.887 --> 07:34.845
a little bit like you, Blake.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.762
Are you just a little Blake?

07:38.806 --> 07:39.981
Huh?
BLAKE:
Let me see him.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.988
Yeah. Hey.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.555
Oh!

07:48.598 --> 07:51.035
And that's my cue to leave.

07:52.820 --> 07:53.995
It'll come out in the wash.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.302
Yeah, not my first rodeo.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.391
Those were good days,
weren't they?

07:59.435 --> 08:00.654
When the kids were babies.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.264
Yeah, before they could talk.

08:02.307 --> 08:05.441
You know, maybe Sam's right.
This is a sign,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.225
this baby, for us, too.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.750
I mean, as the psychic said,
you and I share a destiny.

08:09.793 --> 08:12.666
Nobody wants Steven and Sam
to have a family more than I do,

08:12.709 --> 08:14.015
and if this is their baby,

08:14.058 --> 08:15.886
no one would be happier.

08:15.930 --> 08:19.499
I knew you felt it.
Somewhere in there...

08:19.542 --> 08:21.849
But us becoming grandparents

08:21.892 --> 08:23.764
to that kid or any other

08:23.807 --> 08:25.679
doesn't mean we'd be
doing it together.

08:25.722 --> 08:27.245
Because if there is such a thing
as destiny,

08:27.289 --> 08:28.377
mine is with Cristal.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.424

but I'll have my best mixer
here on Tuesday night.

09:00.757 --> 09:01.802
Can I come, too?

09:01.845 --> 09:02.977
I might be able
to pull a few strings,

09:03.020 --> 09:04.369
get you on the list.

09:04.413 --> 09:08.460
Isis, Alexe, this is
Fallon Carrington. This is...

09:08.504 --> 09:11.681
St. Beauty. I'm a fan.Isis is a friend

09:11.725 --> 09:14.597
from way back.You're lucky
you can still book us.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.599
I first saw them at a showcase.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.383
Then they get signed
by Wondaland,

09:18.427 --> 09:20.168
suddenly they are
too cool for me.

09:20.211 --> 09:23.258
Hey. Monica, you should
do a showcase here.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.608
With your club. I mean, you've
always had an eye for talent,

09:25.652 --> 09:27.392
and there's plenty in Atlanta
waiting to be signed.

09:27.436 --> 09:28.959
Except I don't have
a record label.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.875
Why not?Okay, I'm still
figuring out this business.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.921
Speaking of which,
I'll see you guys Tuesday?

09:33.964 --> 09:35.836
We'll be here.
Good to meet you, Fallon.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.273
You, too.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.144
I can help you. I know
how to start a company--

09:40.188 --> 09:42.407
ask your brother--
and I know how to run one, too.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.974
Don't ask your brother.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.672
Are you really suggesting
that we start a record label?

09:45.715 --> 09:47.108
Together?

09:47.151 --> 09:49.501
We can use this as a launchpad.
We bring the artists

09:49.545 --> 09:50.807
directly to the audience.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.853
Can be independent, female-run.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.724
You know I love you,
but I don't think

09:54.768 --> 09:56.683
working together
is the best idea for us.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.684
Did you already forget

09:57.727 --> 09:59.294
the drama we had
over this place?

09:59.337 --> 10:00.425
Oh, that was different.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.210
You just finished
selling a company.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.646
Why don't you take a minute

10:03.690 --> 10:05.300
to just... do you?

10:05.343 --> 10:07.258
But this is me. I work.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.825
And I need something
to focus on.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.958
Wow, you really don't want
to plan a wedding, do you?

10:11.001 --> 10:14.004
But I'm not trying to be
someone's project, Fallon.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.353
I'm sure you'll find
another one.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.530
Can you wait
ten more minutes to eat?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.707
I need to go check inventory.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.451
What a lovely coat.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.844
Is that a polyblend?

10:27.888 --> 10:30.760
It's cashmere, actually.
But thank you.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.981
Pretty flowers. Weren't those
in the dining room this morning?

10:34.024 --> 10:36.026
Just borrowing a few odds
and ends for my place

10:36.070 --> 10:37.637
until I have time
to go shopping.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.986
Is the loft finished already?

10:39.029 --> 10:40.901
Things move fast
around here.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.554
You don't have to tell me.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.208
And now we have
a baby here, too.

10:44.252 --> 10:47.777
I just can't wait to put down
new roots. Literally.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.040
We've been through a lot
as a family, but...

10:50.084 --> 10:52.608
that's what family is:
people with...

10:52.652 --> 10:53.914
a shared history.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.742
And Blake and I have a long one.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.788
I'm just looking forward
to a long future here.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.747
Make sure you don't
overwater that dracaena.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.923
Roots can rot, you know?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.666
How sweet of you.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.059
You know, if I were you,
I'd get out now,

11:09.103 --> 11:11.671
while that pure little heart
is still in one piece.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.150
This may seem like
a big house,

11:13.194 --> 11:16.458
but... there's
only so much room.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.721
I know this is moving fast...

11:18.765 --> 11:21.768
but I love Blake,
and I think he loves me, too.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.945
Since we're about to
go to look at rings.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.034
: Oh.
I'm surprised that jeweler

11:27.077 --> 11:29.863
hasn't given him
a punch card by now.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.691
Don't say I didn't warn you.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.174
I got it. Don't worry.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.090
ANDERS:
So, seam on the outside,

11:40.134 --> 11:42.614
and fold on the inside.

11:42.658 --> 11:43.920
Thank you.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.009
Has that dog
ever been on a leash?

11:46.053 --> 11:48.925
We'll have to work on that.As wonderful as it is

11:48.969 --> 11:51.841
that you want to take Bo
under your wing,

11:51.885 --> 11:54.191
and as glad as I am to
have you staying here,

11:54.235 --> 11:57.586
um, has it ever occurred to you
to perhaps get a job?

11:57.629 --> 11:59.370
I mean, outside of the home?

11:59.414 --> 12:01.198
That's very feminist
of you, Daddy.

12:01.242 --> 12:03.897
Don't forget you still
owe a heavy sum to Steven

12:03.940 --> 12:05.202
for that stunt you
pulled in Paraguay

12:05.246 --> 12:06.900
using his credit card.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.511
I'll fill out some applications.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.947
Hey.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.688
Is this thing on right?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.124
Where did you even get that?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.169
The baby shower.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.953
At least some good
came out of it.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.520
We have almost
everything we need.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.435
Just like it was
meant to be.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.437
Until Child Services arrive.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.743
And when they come,

12:23.786 --> 12:25.832
they'll see Little Blake
has everything here.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.790
Obviously,
I'm gonna need some help.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.574
At least until
Steven's back.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.967
I can help.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.928
At least until I get a job.You realize

12:34.971 --> 12:37.974
that a nanny is responsible
for another human being?

12:38.018 --> 12:39.933
Yeah, and she
could barely handle Bo.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.109
But...

12:42.152 --> 12:43.937
you could be, like,
my assistant.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.243
I'd pay you, of course.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.551
I already owe you and Steven,

12:49.594 --> 12:52.336
so why don't we
just call it even?

12:52.380 --> 12:56.340
Sold. First order of business:
finding an actual nanny.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.864
ANDERS:
If you insist,

12:57.907 --> 12:59.953
we might as well do it right.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.650
I'll pull some résumés.

13:01.693 --> 13:02.825
Perfect.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.218
Ooh.

13:04.261 --> 13:07.308
Kirby,
can you run point?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.614
Someone needs
a new diaper.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.487
How about...

13:12.530 --> 13:13.880
this one?

13:13.923 --> 13:16.056
It's beautiful.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.274
See?

13:17.318 --> 13:19.711
I have good taste in
the important things.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.409
Yes.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.976
Alexis mentioned.

13:23.019 --> 13:26.066
She made sure to remind me
that you've done this before.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.894
And that doesn't matter.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.679
I know. I know.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.159
But I don't think she likes me.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.291
What did she say?That she didn't like me.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.076
And how the two of you

13:36.119 --> 13:38.992
have a long history together,
and I should get out

13:39.035 --> 13:40.994
before my heart
gets broken.Hey, hey,

13:41.037 --> 13:42.256
Alexis is delusional.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.388
It was that damn
psychic, I swear.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.217
Apparently, she told Alexis that
we were meant to be together,

13:47.261 --> 13:48.871
and Alexis ate it up.

13:48.915 --> 13:52.005
Adriana has a strong intuition.So do I.

13:52.048 --> 13:55.051
I don't need a psychic to
tell me how I feel about you.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.924
And I sure as hell
don't need Alexis.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.404
And I'm relieved to hear that.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.846
Do you have any more?MAN:
Of course, sir.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.283
What is that?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.111
Well, obviously,
nothing is set in stone;

14:11.154 --> 14:14.201
this is just to give you
an idea of what I'm thinking.

14:14.244 --> 14:17.117
Did you seriously just make
that in the last 20 minutes?Mm-hmm.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.858
I should have known.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.424
Once you have something
in your head...

14:20.468 --> 14:23.819
What I have is the technical
experience and strategic vision

14:23.863 --> 14:25.603
to make this company viable.

14:25.647 --> 14:28.128
You have the real estate.
You have the creative judgment.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.694
We both have the capital.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.349
We could be
equal partners, 50-50.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.135
You gonna put
that in writing?
Sure.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.615
Okay, is something wrong?

14:37.659 --> 14:39.356
Is this about
Culhane, or...?

14:39.400 --> 14:40.836
No. No, no, no.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.098
This is not
about my wedding.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.796
This is about me.
I told you I work.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.060
What I'm thinking is we build
on what you already have.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.149
People come to see St. Beauty,

14:49.192 --> 14:50.672
and they get to see some of

14:50.715 --> 14:52.239
the greatest up-and-coming
talent in Atlanta.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.067
A showcase.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.983
Now that you mention it,
there's a utility room upstairs

14:57.026 --> 14:58.506
that could be a greenroom.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.334
Does that mean you're in?

15:00.377 --> 15:02.684
Let's just start with Tuesday
and see how it goes.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.991
I'll have Jeff get his
poker tables out of there.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.079
Poker?

15:06.122 --> 15:07.950
I let him have a game up there

15:07.994 --> 15:10.387
the other week while you were
busy getting divorced from Liam.

15:10.431 --> 15:13.564
Well, maybe he'll invite me
to the next one.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.958
ALEXIS:
Please be gentle with those.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.961
There are antiques in there that
are worth more than your car.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.441
Yes, Ms. Carrington.Actually, put them

15:20.484 --> 15:22.747
right over there in the corner;
I'll empty it myself.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.663
I'm also gonna need to borrow a
few things from the main house:

15:25.707 --> 15:28.536
the good silver trays,
Lalique decanters...

15:28.579 --> 15:30.103
I think Mr. Anders might notice.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.061
Well, they're
not for me, dear.

15:32.105 --> 15:36.109
I want to have everyone over for
a little family housewarming.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.981
Blake needs to know
that I'm here to stay

15:39.025 --> 15:41.679
before he puts a diamond
on another Cristal.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.248
This is my new chapter, too.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.948
My flowers-- what...

15:48.991 --> 15:50.384
what happened here?

15:50.427 --> 15:54.170
Even the cactus is dead.
It's like a plant Holocaust.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.172
What evil spirits
did you piss off?

15:56.216 --> 15:59.088
I mean, someone
did die in here.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.568
♪

16:09.838 --> 16:12.145
Oh, did Monica make you
a promoter?

16:12.188 --> 16:13.407
Actually, it
was my idea.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.149
Welcome to Broken Glass
Recording Artists,

16:16.192 --> 16:18.151
bringing the next generation
of women into the spotlight.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.153
Oh, you are just full
of secrets.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.284
Didn't know
you were trying

16:21.328 --> 16:22.720
to break into
the music business.

16:22.764 --> 16:25.506
Mm. I wasn't. Sometimes
you just see an opportunity

16:25.549 --> 16:27.551
and you have to take a leap.

16:27.595 --> 16:31.120
And if I know you, you'll be
the female Clive Davis by 30.

16:31.164 --> 16:32.730
And it all starts Tuesday night,

16:32.774 --> 16:34.254
when we bring the most
promising artists

16:34.297 --> 16:37.648
in Atlanta to Club Colby.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.434
MONICA:
So, you're gonna have to have
those tables out of there

16:40.477 --> 16:42.088
by Tuesday morning.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.220
But we're playing that night.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.179
Doesn't St. Beauty
already have a record deal?

16:46.222 --> 16:47.180
Until I make them a better one.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.008
Let me be clear.
Your game's over.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.705
And you and your friends
should be coming

16:50.748 --> 16:52.837
to the showcase
to support your sister.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.709
Are you sure
this is even a good idea?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.493
Going into business
with another Colby?

16:56.537 --> 16:57.842
You were the one
who warned me against it,

16:57.886 --> 16:59.540
and look what happened.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.890
There were some...
extenuating circumstances.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.413
Like the fact
that you slept with her

17:03.457 --> 17:04.893
and that she was
our secret cousin?

17:04.936 --> 17:06.025
FALLON:
I'm just saying,

17:06.068 --> 17:07.156
this time is different.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.897
MONICA:
I'm going into this eyes open.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.551
And the showcase will be
a good test.

17:10.594 --> 17:12.379
And unless you have a problem...Is there a problem?

17:12.422 --> 17:13.597
No.
Nope.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.643
Good.
Good.

17:18.385 --> 17:20.561
I'll get it.
You carry on.

17:21.605 --> 17:22.954
Cristal.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.347
What are you doing here?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.523
I've been thinking
about what you said earlier,

17:26.567 --> 17:27.742
and you're right;

17:27.785 --> 17:29.874
you and Blake have
so much history.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.920
And with a grandchild,
especially,

17:31.963 --> 17:33.530
you're not going anywhere.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.619
Well, I'm glad
you understand.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.405
So I really want us
to get off on the right foot.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.754
You really think
I'm that gullible?

17:39.797 --> 17:41.060
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.018
We're not friends,
and you know it.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.934
You don't like me, and I don't
buy your act of kindness...

17:45.977 --> 17:47.805
unless you're
trying to kill me.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.155
Are they laced?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.983
Oh. I hope not, because
I had one on the way over.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.421
You're right,
we're not friends.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.858
The truth is...

17:56.901 --> 17:58.990
you're kind of scary.Hmm.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.950
Oh, my God, is that
the fern from the house?

18:01.993 --> 18:04.039
None of them are looking
too good, are they?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.868
They're all dead.
It's spooky.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.130
It is strange.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.263
And it seems fine
everywhere else.

18:10.306 --> 18:13.135
I mean...I'm sure that there's
a logical explanation.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.919
The place is not haunted.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.660
You're a sensitive person,
Alexis;

18:16.704 --> 18:18.575
I'm sure
you can feel it, too.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.056
I mean, after what happened
to Celia, I can only imagine

18:21.100 --> 18:23.363
the bad energy that must
be swirling around here.

18:23.406 --> 18:24.886
How could anything live?

18:24.929 --> 18:28.063
Andneither of us wants
Celia's spirit unsettled.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.153
I have some sage
in the house.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.154
Let me go get it.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.982
We can clear this
place together.

18:34.025 --> 18:38.160
Mm, I suppose there's
no harm in a little sage.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.815
Here are the top 25 candidates,

18:40.858 --> 18:43.948
all eminently qualified,
carefully vetted,

18:43.992 --> 18:46.081
and handpicked by me.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.430
:
Prudence?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.128
What is this, 1700?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.303
Well, she didn't name herself.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.608
She kind of looks like someone

18:51.652 --> 18:52.957
who wouldname herself Prudence.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.437
Pass.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.309
You haven't even considered
her experience, her skills.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.049
Oh, you're right.
I can't make this decision

18:58.093 --> 19:00.965
off a piece of paper--
I need to see them in action.

19:01.009 --> 19:03.620
Well, why don't I arrange
to have them come in person?

19:03.664 --> 19:05.144
Then you can vet them.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.146
And they can vet you.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.715
this record label's
a permanent thing?

when they get their hearts

19:14.414 --> 19:17.156
andtheir wallets
set on something.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.204
We'll just have to tell Ada
something came up.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.858
Youwant to tell her that?

19:26.077 --> 19:27.601
Then I should tell Monica.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.385
I'm not cool
keeping this from her.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.257

19:31.300 --> 19:33.563
I don't want
to drag them into this.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.043
It's a little late
for that.

she has dirt on.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.178

19:40.266 --> 19:42.311
I know you want to be the hero,

19:42.355 --> 19:45.053
but shouldn't you get
the secrets out of the way now?

19:45.096 --> 19:46.359

my own relationship.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.453

Um, can't say that I have.

bit like perfume.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.154

20:00.242 --> 20:01.809
until you wash it away.

kind of a spiritual shower.

burn anything,

38:15.902 --> 38:17.338
I'll be in touch.

38:32.092 --> 38:35.095
Who is it?

38:35.138 --> 38:36.401
Oh, my God.

38:36.444 --> 38:38.054
Don't tell me you're still here.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.839
I thought
you were

38:39.882 --> 38:41.406
just a temporary infestation.

38:41.449 --> 38:44.104
I thought you could use
some help cleaning up.

38:45.497 --> 38:48.108
Well, the floors are still
a bit damp, and I am

38:48.151 --> 38:49.414
having a housewarming
this evening.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.024
Oh.You could probably

38:51.067 --> 38:53.505
hold a blow dryer
without burning the place down.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.507
Just don't hold it too close,
and keep it moving.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.857
Okay.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.076
Mm, some towels might help.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.077
What are you doing?

39:01.121 --> 39:02.209
Don't open that.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.691
Why?

39:05.734 --> 39:07.475
Were you hiding something
in here?

39:09.085 --> 39:11.218
Oh, that's right. You were.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.263
I didn't mean to!

39:13.307 --> 39:14.613
I'm sorry!
Do you have any towels?!

39:14.656 --> 39:18.094
You've done enough
damage already!

39:18.138 --> 39:20.009
Imagine my surprise
when I went,

39:20.053 --> 39:21.402
the other night,
looking for towels

39:21.446 --> 39:23.709
and found the Baby Jesus
instead.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.145
The same one

39:25.188 --> 39:27.190
that's been missing
from the nativity scene

39:27.234 --> 39:28.496
since Little Blake showed up.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.020
Obviously, you are
desperate to keep Blake.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.195
But this is

39:32.239 --> 39:33.196
a whole new level,

39:33.240 --> 39:34.197
accusing me of...

39:35.242 --> 39:36.504
I don't even know what.

39:36.548 --> 39:38.245
Of course you'd think
this was about Blake.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.943
You admitted it.I said what
you wanted to hear.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.205
I knew what you thought.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.382
That I was weak, naive.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.340
That you could bully me out
of here.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.255
You know, if I were you,
I'd get out now,

39:48.298 --> 39:51.171
while that pure little heart
is still in one piece.

39:51.214 --> 39:54.174
This may seem
like a big house, but...

39:54.217 --> 39:56.263
JENNINGS:
"There's only so much room."

39:56.306 --> 39:57.307
Right?

39:58.352 --> 40:00.659
So you didn't kill my plants?

40:00.702 --> 40:03.313
Oh, I did. To give you
a taste of your own medicine.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.141
And I set off
those sprinklers, too.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.883
Because if one of us had to go, it wasn't gonna be me.

40:07.927 --> 40:10.146
Oh, no.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.974
Clearly, that wasn't
a permanent solution.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.194
Water dries.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.892
So when I saw the Baby Jesus,
I realized it was better

40:16.936 --> 40:19.591
than anything I could come up
with to drive you out.

40:19.634 --> 40:20.679
And when you came running in

40:20.722 --> 40:22.289
to show me all
the flickering lights

40:22.332 --> 40:24.247
and the banging pipes...

40:24.291 --> 40:26.249
It must be 100 degrees in here.

40:26.293 --> 40:28.121
...I realized you were
trying to call my bluff,

40:28.164 --> 40:29.557
daring me to fold.

40:29.601 --> 40:32.473
Going bigger and bigger
to scare me into a confession.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.301
And it worked.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.738
But if you knew,
why'd you play along?

40:36.782 --> 40:39.349
No, because it couldn't
be too easy.

40:39.393 --> 40:41.221
I needed you to believe
it was genuine...

40:41.264 --> 40:44.311
I will have the cleaning fees
added to your bill

40:44.354 --> 40:46.313
when you leave.

40:48.271 --> 40:51.318
Really?
Google Translate?

40:51.361 --> 40:53.799
Bitch.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.279
...so when I finally gave it up,
you'd run right to Blake.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.325
That was all the time I needed.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.674
I told you Cristal
was a liar.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.241
She's right.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.636
And where is this Baby Jesus?

41:04.679 --> 41:05.898
Did you give him to Blake?

41:05.941 --> 41:07.769
I thought of it.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.728
But I knew if I was
the one to discover it,

41:09.771 --> 41:11.338
you might just say
that I framed you.

41:11.381 --> 41:14.254
I needed someone else
to find it.

41:14.297 --> 41:17.562
So I asked Sam
to do me a little favor.

41:17.605 --> 41:19.172
Hello?

41:21.566 --> 41:24.220
What the hell?

41:24.264 --> 41:26.266
JENNINGS:
What is he going to think
when he finds

41:26.309 --> 41:28.181
the Baby Jesus
in an old car seat

41:28.224 --> 41:31.314
in your trailer, Alexis?You put it there.

41:31.358 --> 41:33.099
When he realizes
that you're the one

41:33.142 --> 41:34.927
who put the baby in that manger.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.363
That you've been lying to him.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.365
To the whole family.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.280
Preying on their emotions,

41:40.323 --> 41:42.804
just so you can get your claws
back into Blake.

41:42.848 --> 41:45.633
Oy, that's positively
Shakespearean.

41:45.677 --> 41:49.594
What's the phrase,
"hoisted on your own petard"?

41:49.637 --> 41:52.597
I can explain.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.555
Maybe you should start with

41:54.599 --> 41:56.949
where the hell
you got that baby.
