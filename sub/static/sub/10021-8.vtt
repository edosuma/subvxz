00:06.567 --> 00:07.659
PreviousIy on <i>ER:</i>

00:07.869 --> 00:11.202
Students don't know anything.
It's your job to teach them.

00:11.405 --> 00:12.770
Are you against this girI?

00:12.974 --> 00:16.967
-You think I shouId taIk to Carter?
-You don't want to be confrontationaI.

00:17.178 --> 00:18.770
You don't even hear me.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.345
TaIk to me, not each other.

00:20.548 --> 00:23.278
One good thing about Lucy:
she's not here.

00:23.484 --> 00:26.920
Whatever this is, I can't fix it.
Work it out, both of you.

00:34.328 --> 00:36.922
Hook her up to the puIse ox.
Hang 500 of saIine.

00:37.131 --> 00:39.691
BP's 1 20 over 30.
PuIse 80.

00:39.901 --> 00:41.232
-The second crit?
-Coming.

00:41.435 --> 00:43.995
-Daddy, it hurts.
-I know, honey, I know.

00:44.205 --> 00:46.298
They'II heIp.
It's gonna be aII right.

00:46.507 --> 00:48.304
Can't you give her something?

00:48.509 --> 00:50.773
CaroI, titrate another
two of morphine.

00:50.978 --> 00:52.502
-Dr. Greene?
-He's on his way.

00:52.713 --> 00:55.181
-Page Benton, it's a spIenic injury.
-That bad?

00:55.383 --> 00:58.409
-Daddy, you're bIeeding.
-Lucy, I thought you sutured him.

00:58.619 --> 01:01.816
-He wanted to go to CT with her.
-Crit's 24 after 600 cc's.

01:02.023 --> 01:03.490
-What was the Iast one?
-33.

01:03.691 --> 01:06.592
Mr. Sawyer, we shouId suture that.
Come with me.

01:06.794 --> 01:10.321
-What's wrong with her?
-She is bIeeding from her spIeen.

01:10.531 --> 01:12.624
-My God!
-SpIenic injuries this size...

01:12.834 --> 01:14.665
...usuaIIy heaI in chiIdren.

01:14.869 --> 01:17.804
-What do you do?
-If she's stabIe, transfer some bIood.

01:18.005 --> 01:20.496
So Iet Ms. Knight suture that cut
and I'II--

01:20.708 --> 01:21.936
I want to be with her!

01:22.143 --> 01:24.805
First take care of the gash.
I want her cIean.

01:25.012 --> 01:27.446
Corinna, I'm gonna be
right next door, okay?

01:27.648 --> 01:29.639
-4-0 nyIon, Lucy.
-I know.

01:29.851 --> 01:31.648
-I Iove you, sweetie.
-I Iove you.

01:31.853 --> 01:33.616
-Lucy, can you get consent?
-Yeah.

01:33.855 --> 01:35.186
Right through here.

01:35.389 --> 01:38.654
I never saw it. The van came
out of nowhere and just hit us.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.693
-You need to sign this. Sit down.
-WeII, what is it?

01:41.896 --> 01:45.297
It authorizes bIood transfusion
and emergency surgery.

01:45.499 --> 01:48.491
-I thought she didn't need surgery.
-It's just in case.

01:48.703 --> 01:52.195
How Iong? How Iong
wiII she have to stay?

01:52.406 --> 01:53.395
It's hard to teII.

01:54.108 --> 01:55.871
-Do you have insurance?
-What?

01:56.110 --> 01:58.635
Uh, yeah. But I Ieft it
in my waIIet...

01:58.846 --> 02:01.781
...in the gIove compartment.
I'm not sure I can get it.

02:01.983 --> 02:04.850
We can caII. Which insurance
company is it?

02:05.186 --> 02:06.744
BIue Cross.

02:06.954 --> 02:11.482
Listen, can you do me a favor
and caII her mother in CIeveIand?

02:11.993 --> 02:14.860
-She shouId know about this.
-Want to use the phone?

02:15.796 --> 02:20.096
No. It's best that you
make the caII. PIease.

02:21.469 --> 02:23.494
A muItivictim MVA, father/daughter.

02:23.704 --> 02:26.036
Daughter's CT shows
a grade-2 spIenic Iac.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.140
StabIe, but her crit dropped nine.

02:28.342 --> 02:30.401
-How's the father?
-A minor scaIp Iac.

02:30.611 --> 02:32.841
Crit of 42. Awake, aIert, oriented.

02:33.047 --> 02:34.309
-What's her name?
-Corinna.

02:34.515 --> 02:36.574
Can you take a breath for me?
Good.

02:36.784 --> 02:39.344
Hi, Corinna, I'm Dr. Greene.
How are you feeIing?

02:39.553 --> 02:42.147
-My back hurts.
-Your back, not your tummy?

02:42.356 --> 02:44.654
-Where's my daddy?
-Right next door, sweetie.

02:44.859 --> 02:46.850
She has rigors. Warm to the touch.

02:47.128 --> 02:49.562
ProbabIe febriIe reaction
to the transfusion.

02:49.764 --> 02:51.823
-How many units are in?
-It's her first.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.694
I need saIine.

02:53.901 --> 02:56.392
RectaI TyIenoI, 500 mgs.

02:56.604 --> 02:59.368
Twenty-five IV, BenadryI.

03:02.243 --> 03:04.438
-BP's down to 60 paIp.
-Corinna?

03:04.645 --> 03:07.273
-BIood's been cross-matched?
-No, it's type-specific.

03:07.481 --> 03:08.379
Pink urine.

03:08.582 --> 03:11.949
-Must be hemoIyzing her bIood ceIIs.
-CouId be bIood from the spIeen.

03:12.153 --> 03:12.983
Maybe both.

03:13.187 --> 03:15.781
500 cc boIus of saIine.
Stand by with epi.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.116
Mix a dopamine drip.

03:17.625 --> 03:20.287
-We're sure it's type-specific?
-Bag says B-positive.

03:20.494 --> 03:22.155
-That's her type.
-AII right.

03:22.363 --> 03:25.992
Retype that bIood and the patient.
BIood bank may have misIabeIed it.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.260
Add a CBC, haptogIobin,
free hemogIobin...

03:29.470 --> 03:32.098
...direct/indirect Coombs. PT, PTT.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.404
-What's going on?
-HemoIytic reaction.

03:35.609 --> 03:37.304
Her system's chewing bIood ceIIs.

03:37.511 --> 03:40.071
-Did you suture the father?
-He wants me to caII the mother.

03:40.281 --> 03:44.547
Go ask him if Corinna has any
history of hematoIogic disease. Now!

03:46.187 --> 03:47.586
Mr. Sawyer?

04:46.080 --> 04:47.445
Hey, Dr. Ross.

04:47.648 --> 04:49.878
-Isn't it Iate for goIf?
-Never too Iate.

04:50.084 --> 04:52.052
-It's November.
-What did I just say?

04:52.253 --> 04:55.279
-Crazy. Carter's going saiIing--
-Hey, way to go, Carter!

04:55.489 --> 04:57.457
-You're rambIing.
-His name's NeIson.

04:57.658 --> 05:00.252
He kidnapped her from
her mother's in CIeveIand.

05:00.461 --> 05:03.953
-Her mother toId you this?
-She's going to the airport now.

05:04.165 --> 05:06.963
So why wouId NeIson give
you her phone number?

05:07.168 --> 05:10.604
He freaked out when he heard
his daughter might need surgery.

05:10.805 --> 05:14.366
-Dr. Greene, we have a situation here.
-Just a second, Carter.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.203
-Are those her Iabs?
-UA shows one pIus biIirubin.

05:17.411 --> 05:18.673
-You on?
-Passing through.

05:18.879 --> 05:21.712
-Was the bIood misIabeIed?
-No, reactions to minor antigens.

05:21.916 --> 05:24.476
-This is tough to match.
-None in the bIood bank.

05:24.685 --> 05:26.414
Did you type the famiIy?

05:26.620 --> 05:28.713
I drew a CBC on the father
but he's gone.

05:28.923 --> 05:30.356
-He kidnapped her.
-What?

05:30.558 --> 05:33.789
Bad custody case. The mother's
on her way from CIeveIand.

05:33.994 --> 05:37.191
-Crit's dropping. We gotta go to O.R.
-There's no bIood.

05:37.398 --> 05:41.630
Carter, type and screen dad's bIood.
Then caII aII the other bIood banks.

05:41.836 --> 05:43.929
-I'II try.
-Lucy, caII his mother back.

05:44.138 --> 05:46.572
Get her records and
have mom's bIood screened.

05:46.774 --> 05:48.969
-She went to the airport.
-Get to her.

05:49.510 --> 05:52.343
-We don't have much time.
-The spIeen couId tamponade.

05:52.546 --> 05:54.571
-Not with crit faIIing.
-It's hemoIysis.

05:54.782 --> 05:56.613
-Come on.
-Might not be her spIeen.

05:56.817 --> 05:59.445
One thing at a time.
We need bIood. Crits at 22?

06:00.488 --> 06:02.854
We have a cushion.
Let's give her steroids.

06:03.057 --> 06:06.390
-CaroI, 500 mgs SoIu-MedroI.
-That might not be enough.

06:06.594 --> 06:08.118
-Want me to Iook?
-Be my guest.

06:08.329 --> 06:10.126
-Peter, you sticking around?
-Sure.

06:10.331 --> 06:12.891
You'd page me in 1 5 minutes anyway.

06:14.969 --> 06:16.334
You caIIed Doug, huh?

06:16.537 --> 06:19.665
-It seemed pretty compIicated.
-No probIem.

06:21.509 --> 06:23.238
That covers the entire state?

06:23.444 --> 06:25.742
Sorry I'm Iate.
Ready to go?

06:25.946 --> 06:27.436
Just a second.
And Indiana?

06:27.648 --> 06:31.311
Just give me two minutes,
I'm kind of tied up here.

06:31.519 --> 06:34.920
-Why are you going saiIing?
-My uncIe's boat is in the harbor.

06:35.122 --> 06:38.580
John offered to motor it to
dry dock whiIe we have decent weather.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.225
I heard it was gonna rain.

06:40.427 --> 06:43.760
I caught the mother. She's faxing
a reIease for the records.

06:43.964 --> 06:47.991
Corinna had a transfusion
for hyperbiIirubinemia as an infant.

06:48.202 --> 06:49.226
-Hi, Lucy.
-Hi.

06:49.436 --> 06:52.769
-But she has a different bIood type.
-Figures, dad matches.

06:52.973 --> 06:54.440
-ExactIy?
-To the antibody.

06:54.642 --> 06:58.169
-We gotta find him.
-I'm gonna Ieave you kids aIone.

06:58.379 --> 07:02.145
I've got some phone caIIs to make.
You've got 1 5 minutes, mister.

07:02.349 --> 07:04.817
-You're Ieaving?
-Soon as I find this bIood.

07:05.019 --> 07:08.420
-Great. So I can go?
-Yeah, sure, Lucy. BaiI.

07:08.656 --> 07:10.988
-BIood Registry.
-I'm gonna find the father.

07:11.192 --> 07:13.956
-I got an address.
-Fugitives give faIse addresses.

07:14.161 --> 07:16.629
-You said I couId go, so I'm going.
-Whatever.

07:17.164 --> 07:20.133
-Why be such an ass?
-Lucy, I don't care what you do.

07:20.334 --> 07:22.632
I'm gonna try and find
bIood for his kid.

07:23.237 --> 07:24.169
So am I.

07:24.371 --> 07:26.805
-Crit's down to 1 9.
-Steroids aren't working.

07:27.007 --> 07:29.840
Let's go IV IG, 25 grams
over four hours.

07:30.044 --> 07:33.980
I gave you time to treat hemoIysis.
We gotta stop the bIeeding in O.R.

07:34.181 --> 07:37.514
-She's not hemodynamicaIIy stabIe.
-I'II use the ceII saver.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.983
The serum you'd cycIe wouId
keep destroying her ceIIs.

07:41.188 --> 07:42.780
Any word on the bIood?

07:42.990 --> 07:45.481
She has antibodies to
both VeI and Lan.

07:45.693 --> 07:49.424
One is found in four in 10,000 peopIe,
the other in 25,000.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.359
She's got both, so do the math.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.965
-The father matched?
-Let's hope he comes back.

07:54.168 --> 07:57.569
-One in 50,000,000. The math.
-There's nothing in the Midwest.

07:57.771 --> 07:59.671
The Rare Donor Program is on it.

07:59.873 --> 08:02.239
-They're not optimistic.
-We can't wait.

08:02.443 --> 08:06.402
-They won't anesthetize with this crit.
-I wanted to operate earIier.

08:06.614 --> 08:09.811
Right now, donor bIood is
her best chance.

08:10.017 --> 08:13.453
-We'II medicate untiI we get it.
-If we get it.

08:14.288 --> 08:16.950
-Did you reach the hematoIogist?
-He's on his way.

08:17.157 --> 08:18.647
-Why don't you go home?
-What?

08:19.260 --> 08:22.957
-You've been here since midnight.
-Yeah, but I took her.

08:23.697 --> 08:26.131
You know, we've handed off
patients before.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.733
You're covered.
You got three docs here.

08:28.936 --> 08:30.836
Okay, I'II caII in Iater.

08:31.038 --> 08:32.562
-Hey, Mark?
-Sure.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.070
Can you use aIbumin to prime diaIysis?

08:35.275 --> 08:38.245
-What are you thinking?
-PIasmapheresis.

08:38.445 --> 08:40.174
I don't know if that'II heIp.

08:40.681 --> 08:41.875
CouIdn't hurt.

08:44.551 --> 08:47.611
You can arrange it to be
in addition to your pension.

08:47.821 --> 08:49.982
-Tax free?
-Okay.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.851
-You ready to go?
-That's him.

08:52.059 --> 08:53.356
-Dr. Carter?
-Yeah?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.357
James MiddIeton, Chicago PD.

08:55.562 --> 08:58.053
I ran that Iicense.
It's a deaIer pIate.

08:58.265 --> 09:01.723
-Used car Iot on Western and Addison.
-What Iicense number?

09:02.102 --> 09:04.127
On the totaIed Grand Am.

09:04.905 --> 09:08.739
-You guys caIIed about a kidnapping.
-Jerry said this was your case.

09:09.076 --> 09:11.010
Oh, yeah. Did you
find the father?

09:11.512 --> 09:14.174
-Who?
-They were in the accident together.

09:14.381 --> 09:16.212
He had us caII her mom and Ieft.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.214
-A custody dispute?
-He stoIe her.

09:18.419 --> 09:19.818
-When?
-Two weeks ago.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.988
-Is the mom here?
-She's fIying in.

09:22.189 --> 09:25.556
TeII you what. Have her give
me a caII when she gets here.

09:25.759 --> 09:28.284
Might be too Iate.
We need to find this guy.

09:28.796 --> 09:32.857
These things are compIicated.
He might have visitation rights.

09:33.067 --> 09:36.503
No, we need his bIood.
His daughter couId die without it.

09:37.137 --> 09:38.934
-Did he Ieave credit info?
-No.

09:39.139 --> 09:40.800
-SociaI security number?
-No.

09:41.008 --> 09:43.704
Just an address.
But I'm sure it's bogus.

09:44.745 --> 09:47.714
I'II try the Iot. Maybe I
can come up with something.

09:49.550 --> 09:50.539
Hope so.

09:50.751 --> 09:53.652
Okay, Iine's in. Let me get
a heparin fIush.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.880
-Where's the pIasmapheresis unit?
-On the way down.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.454
Daddy?

09:59.660 --> 10:02.652
Hi, honey. Conni,
can you get Doug, pIease?

10:04.231 --> 10:05.858
Where's my daddy?

10:06.166 --> 10:08.191
You're in a hospitaI.

10:08.402 --> 10:10.597
You were in an accident, remember?

10:10.871 --> 10:12.065
Does your tummy hurt?

10:14.308 --> 10:17.675
-Where's my daddy?
-We're gonna take good care of you.

10:18.445 --> 10:19.571
My name is CaroI.

10:20.614 --> 10:22.047
I want my daddy.

10:22.249 --> 10:24.342
Your mom's coming.
She'II be here soon.

10:24.952 --> 10:26.010
Daddy?

10:27.321 --> 10:30.290
Your daddy's fine. He's just...

10:30.491 --> 10:32.425
...he's just not here right now.

10:32.860 --> 10:33.986
Why?

10:40.734 --> 10:42.565
You remember your dog, not me!

10:42.770 --> 10:45.500
-I'm sure it's onIy temporary.
-How's yours going?

10:45.706 --> 10:48.197
He's either suffering
short-term memory Ioss...

10:48.409 --> 10:51.435
...or saw the accident as
a Iast chance to back out.

10:51.645 --> 10:55.411
-Any word from the Rare Donor Program?
-Two words: ''StiII Iooking.''

10:55.616 --> 10:58.551
I got a bIood-bank friend at NIH.
I'II caII him.

10:58.752 --> 11:01.152
-Great, thanks!
-Dr. Greene, Carter Ieft this.

11:01.355 --> 11:03.915
He said a detective may
caII about the father.

11:04.124 --> 11:06.217
-Is he stiII here?
-They Ieft a whiIe ago.

11:06.427 --> 11:09.294
-No, I meant the detective--
-Mark! She's seizing!

11:09.496 --> 11:10.758
-How Iong?
-A minute.

11:12.065 --> 11:14.431
-I got the phenobarbitaI.
-Try Ativan first.

11:14.635 --> 11:16.694
-Accu-Chek's 40.
-I need 50.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.234
-What's her crit?
-1 7.

11:18.439 --> 11:20.134
-Get an H & H.
-She's hypoxic.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.434
-Her kidneys couId go next.
-BP's 100 over 60.

11:23.644 --> 11:25.771
-Push the phenobarb?
-Not gonna do it.

11:25.979 --> 11:27.810
We need some damn bIood.

11:28.449 --> 11:30.007
Doctor, hurry it up.

11:30.217 --> 11:31.684
AII right. Thanks, Jerry.

11:32.419 --> 11:37.220
So there was this girI named Soup.
I don't know why they caIIed her that.

11:37.424 --> 11:41.588
She was two years oIder than us,
so we thought she was reaIIy cooI.

11:41.795 --> 11:45.231
And somehow she convinced us
to sunbathe topIess...

11:45.432 --> 11:47.764
...on this deck.
And I'm not kidding you...

11:47.968 --> 11:49.993
...John, my breasts were purpIe.

11:51.038 --> 11:54.769
And there were bIisters
aII over these....

11:54.975 --> 11:56.101
Wow....

11:59.580 --> 12:01.844
Have you heard anything
I've just said?

12:02.483 --> 12:04.212
-Yeah.
-No, reaIIy.

12:04.418 --> 12:06.477
ReaIIy, what did I just say?

12:07.588 --> 12:08.646
Huh?

12:09.423 --> 12:12.859
I'm sorry. I was thinking
about that girI.

12:13.327 --> 12:18.026
-I shouId reaIIy foIIow up.
-You said they had that covered.

12:20.534 --> 12:23.901
There's just this one other
thing that I wanted to check.

12:24.838 --> 12:26.328
Can you handIe it without me?

12:27.808 --> 12:30.072
No.

12:30.344 --> 12:34.212
Come on. It's no big deaI.
Just powering it up the river.

12:35.349 --> 12:38.785
You're not the onIy one who's busy.
I made time for this too.

12:38.986 --> 12:42.183
I know. But I have to try
to find this guy.

12:43.390 --> 12:47.918
-Because Lucy's Iooking for him?
-Lucy's probabIy home by now.

12:49.296 --> 12:50.490
Right.

12:54.234 --> 12:56.134
Come on. Get on the boat.

13:00.841 --> 13:05.244
-I'm sorry. I'II caII you Iater?
-What? I can't hear you.

13:21.261 --> 13:25.595
A Ioaner, the cars we Ioan to
customers to run errands and stuff.

13:25.799 --> 13:28.131
-The owner gave it out.
-Can I taIk to him?

13:28.335 --> 13:31.236
He's in Vegas. If he wins,
we never hear from him.

13:31.438 --> 13:34.373
-And no paperwork on him?
-We're pretty Iax about that.

13:34.575 --> 13:36.941
Mort, Ieave that out.
The rain's passing.

13:37.144 --> 13:39.510
It's important that
we find the driver.

13:39.713 --> 13:41.977
Cop said the same.
Wish I couId heIp.

13:42.182 --> 13:45.913
He was in the accident
with his daughter and she's dying.

13:46.119 --> 13:48.144
His bIood may save her Iife.

13:48.355 --> 13:50.482
-There's no other way to find him?
-No.

13:50.691 --> 13:53.125
-Gee, that sucks.
-Yeah.

13:53.560 --> 13:57.394
-I'd heIp you if I couId, man.
-WouId you give me a caII?

13:57.798 --> 13:59.925
I'II give you a caII
if I hear anything.

14:04.004 --> 14:05.596
Hey, hoId up.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.436
I'II deny anything you say
to the cops.

14:10.644 --> 14:12.874
-I Ioaned it to my bookie.
-What's his name?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.479
He's your guy. NeIson.

14:14.748 --> 14:18.240
I stiII owe some money. He's
been good about my payment pIan.

14:18.485 --> 14:22.182
He wanted to borrow a car for a
few days whiIe he had his daughter.

14:22.556 --> 14:25.650
-How do I reach him?
-I onIy met him one other time.

14:25.859 --> 14:28.259
-Then how--?
-I pIace my bets with the beIIhop...

14:28.462 --> 14:29.690
...at The DeIaware.

14:29.896 --> 14:33.127
-There's no gambIing on the premises.
-I didn't mean you.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.927
I was toId there was
a beIIboy who covers bets.

14:36.136 --> 14:39.435
I thought I toId you, there's
no gambIing on the premises.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.006
Not officiaIIy. Sure.

14:42.209 --> 14:44.109
Like there's no prostitutes.

14:55.489 --> 14:56.421
Excuse me!

14:58.025 --> 15:00.892
-I wonder-- What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

15:01.094 --> 15:02.823
-I meant her.
-Just a minute.

15:03.030 --> 15:06.124
-You work for NeIson?
-I gotta get back to work.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.767
Just a second.
You said you knew a guy.

15:08.969 --> 15:10.698
-I didn't say that.
-Just a name.

15:10.904 --> 15:12.269
Hey, excuse me.

15:12.606 --> 15:14.164
-We got money.
-Let me go, man.

15:14.374 --> 15:16.137
-We need this guy.
-Get off me!

15:16.343 --> 15:18.436
I don't know what
you're taIking about!

15:20.347 --> 15:23.145
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-What?

15:23.850 --> 15:27.342
He was about to teII me about
the guy who runs bets for NeIson.

15:27.554 --> 15:30.114
-How did you know?
-Neighborhood gossip.

15:30.323 --> 15:32.416
The address wasn't fake.
It was oId.

15:32.626 --> 15:34.025
I thought you had a date.

15:34.227 --> 15:36.195
We stiII haven't found
a bIood match.

15:36.396 --> 15:37.954
-Thought I'd try.
-They operate?

15:38.165 --> 15:39.962
Crit's Iow, she had a seizure.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.794
What kind of action you want?

15:42.002 --> 15:46.496
-I can handIe OTB, numbers, whatever.
-We're just Iooking for someone.

15:46.707 --> 15:47.969
Oh, okay. See you.

15:48.175 --> 15:50.905
No, wait! We want to bet!
We want to pIace a bet.

15:51.144 --> 15:54.602
It's just that NeIson toId
us to taIk to a beIIhop boy.

15:54.948 --> 15:57.246
When, in the Ice Age?
Toby got fired.

15:57.451 --> 15:59.351
-Toby.
-He covers NeIson's action.

15:59.553 --> 16:02.317
-Where does he Iive?
-He's one of those ghetto boys...

16:02.522 --> 16:04.547
-...the Butcher gets jobs for.
-The who?

16:04.758 --> 16:08.091
A ''Iost youth'' guy. Works
at a meat-packing pIant.

16:08.295 --> 16:12.925
WaIk in and Iook at the nametags.
Jerry, can you answer that?

16:13.133 --> 16:15.533
-Chuny, you mind?
-Whoa! Jerry, what's this?

16:15.736 --> 16:18.170
We're not moving patients.
Triage is on me.

16:18.371 --> 16:21.966
OnIy emergent cases get on the
board untiI we have a free bed.

16:22.175 --> 16:23.904
-Anything?
-He hasn't answered.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.773
-I'm trying to find him.
-What do I do with these?

16:26.980 --> 16:29.039
-Where's DoyIe?
-I'm doing my share.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.912
-She's been on the phone for an hour.
-I'II take the LP and migraine.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.715
You take the treat and streets.
And get Jerry some free beds.

16:36.923 --> 16:39.187
Benton wants to caII Anspaugh.
Any bIood?

16:39.392 --> 16:41.189
-No.
-Corinna's mother's at O'Hare.

16:41.394 --> 16:44.329
-She wants an update.
-I'II brief her in person.

16:44.531 --> 16:47.329
I got Lucy on Iine two.
She wants a status report.

16:47.534 --> 16:49.934
I'm hoIding for John Derby.
Derby. Yes.

16:50.137 --> 16:52.401
-Derby, the NIH guy?
-Yes.

16:52.706 --> 16:56.073
He returned your caII, your page.
Left a mobiIe number.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.334
Jerry...

16:57.744 --> 17:00.713
-...why didn't you teII me?
-You've been on the phone.

17:02.916 --> 17:04.315
Okay. Thanks, CaroI.

17:04.518 --> 17:06.713
I don't think this is the right way.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.685
-She said it's past the conveyor beIt.
-What beIt? AII I see is beef.

17:10.891 --> 17:13.223
Here. Whoa! God!

17:13.425 --> 17:16.417
-Any Iuck?
-No. No match yet.

17:16.762 --> 17:20.493
-We're Iooking for the boning room.
-What exactIy happens there?

17:21.367 --> 17:24.030
-This is the wrong way.
-I didn't see you Ieading.

17:24.237 --> 17:26.000
AII right. I'II Iead then.

17:27.808 --> 17:30.572
-Hey! Where are you going?
-To find the boning room.

17:30.777 --> 17:33.769
-You said I couId Iead.
-I didn't say I'd foIIow you.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.608
-I didn't ask you to come with me.
-I didn't either.

17:36.817 --> 17:40.150
-I'm not with you. I Iooked first.
-What does that mean?

17:40.353 --> 17:43.322
If you were right, you wouIdn't
be waIking around here.

17:43.523 --> 17:47.687
I wouIdn't be waIking around a meat
Iocker if you hadn't Iet the guy go.

17:48.395 --> 17:49.794
I knew it.

17:49.996 --> 17:51.520
I knew you bIamed me.

17:51.731 --> 17:55.189
A IittIe girI's dying, Lucy.
You can reIax about you.

17:55.402 --> 17:56.460
Hey!

17:56.870 --> 17:57.734
Hey!

17:58.305 --> 18:00.569
-What?
-Boning Room!

18:04.611 --> 18:08.172
This city buiIds detention centers
10 years before they're needed.

18:08.381 --> 18:12.579
But they can't start a job program
for kids. Prisons, yes. Jobs, no.

18:12.786 --> 18:16.222
WeII, at this job, Toby took
bets for a man named NeIson.

18:16.423 --> 18:18.220
Not everybody's a success story.

18:18.425 --> 18:21.121
-Where can we find him?
-I don't snitch on my kids.

18:21.328 --> 18:22.659
Without trust, it's over.

18:23.897 --> 18:25.159
Want to save kids?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.568
I got one you can save!

18:30.937 --> 18:34.031
Crit's at 1 6. I think
we stopped the hemoIysis.

18:34.241 --> 18:38.007
Her kidneys are faiIing.
She'II die if her spIeen's bIeeding.

18:38.211 --> 18:40.543
No one disagrees. She needs surgery.

18:40.747 --> 18:43.375
The question is, how Iong
can we wait for bIood?

18:43.583 --> 18:45.881
It may never come.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.577
At some point, there
are desperate measures.

18:48.788 --> 18:49.914
We're not there yet.

18:50.123 --> 18:52.648
Oh, my God! Corinna?

18:53.360 --> 18:54.418
Can she hear me?

18:55.462 --> 18:57.953
-She's been drifting.
-We shouId type the mom.

18:58.164 --> 19:00.155
I did whiIe I was briefing her.

19:00.367 --> 19:02.597
-A-positive.
-I can't give it anyway?

19:03.036 --> 19:05.596
-It's better than nothing.
-She needs a match.

19:05.805 --> 19:07.363
And Keith has it?

19:08.308 --> 19:09.775
How typicaI!

19:09.976 --> 19:13.878
He takes her, hurts her,
and runs away when she needs him.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.104
-Got it!
-What?

19:15.348 --> 19:18.078
NIH found a match. Two
frozen units in NashviIIe.

19:18.285 --> 19:20.378
-How Iong?
-It's in the air in 10 minutes.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.680
AII right!
Let's get her up to preop.

19:22.889 --> 19:24.481
I want to be ready.

19:25.926 --> 19:29.191
-There's number eight.
-This is nuts.

19:30.263 --> 19:32.561
Toby might not even know NeIson.

19:32.766 --> 19:34.666
We're here. We might as weII try.

19:34.868 --> 19:36.665
-Have a IittIe faith.
-Faith?

19:36.870 --> 19:38.895
What, in our abiIity to find one guy?

19:39.105 --> 19:41.903
-Then go home. I'II find him myseIf.
-Yeah, right.

19:43.944 --> 19:46.174
-I'II be right back.
-Where are you going?

19:48.915 --> 19:51.475
-Yeah?
-Hi. Is Toby here?

19:51.685 --> 19:52.549
Who are you?

19:55.288 --> 19:56.448
Hi.

19:57.757 --> 19:58.746
You Iive here?

20:00.393 --> 20:03.260
-Where are your cIothes?
-He doesn't taIk much.

20:04.497 --> 20:05.555
Are you his sister?

20:08.201 --> 20:11.102
-Who's that?
-His mom. She's sick.

20:11.404 --> 20:14.532
That's a bad cough.
Has she had it for a Iong time?

20:14.841 --> 20:17.071
-A whiIe.
-What's her name?

20:17.577 --> 20:18.737
Mrs. Price.

20:22.582 --> 20:25.073
Maybe I shouId go in
and see if she's okay.

20:25.385 --> 20:28.684
You shouIdn't go in there.
That's not your house.

20:30.790 --> 20:32.417
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

20:35.395 --> 20:37.056
WouId you watch him?

20:39.299 --> 20:40.288
Yeah?

20:43.803 --> 20:45.065
HeIIo?

20:51.978 --> 20:53.206
HeIIo?

20:54.314 --> 20:55.747
Mrs. Price?

20:56.783 --> 20:58.182
Who's there?

20:58.385 --> 21:02.219
My name is Dr. Carter.
I just saw your boy outside.

21:03.757 --> 21:06.453
Don't be afraid. I came
in to see if you're okay.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.928
-Who Iet you in?
-The door was open.

21:12.265 --> 21:13.493
I heard you coughing.

21:16.903 --> 21:17.961
It's bronchitis.

21:18.304 --> 21:19.498
I've had it before.

21:21.408 --> 21:24.741
Are you coughing up bIood?
Is that bIood you're coughing now?

21:25.445 --> 21:26.673
-A IittIe.
-Any fever?

21:27.781 --> 21:30.306
Has anyone ever done a
TB test on you?

21:30.517 --> 21:31.882
Did they prick your arm?

21:33.253 --> 21:36.188
You hoId on, sweetheart.
We're gonna get some heIp.

21:38.191 --> 21:39.681
What the heII you doing?

21:39.893 --> 21:41.520
-Just trying to heIp.
-Right.

21:41.728 --> 21:46.028
-I toId you not to come in here!
-ArieI, go home and stay there!

21:46.232 --> 21:48.723
-I need to caII 91 1 .
-If you're Iucky.

21:48.968 --> 21:54.031
Look, I'm a doctor. If she has
tubercuIosis, it's highIy contagious.

21:54.974 --> 21:58.501
100% oxygen, AC 1 4. TidaI voIume 250.
Set up two bIood-Y's now.

21:58.711 --> 22:00.269

22:04.451 --> 22:06.817
Ma'am, you can't go into the O.R.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.351
-What do I do?
-Wait here.

22:08.555 --> 22:11.649
-Someone wiII taIk to you.
-WiII she Iose more bIood?

22:11.858 --> 22:14.656
-Her bIood count was Iow.
-That's why we're waiting.

22:14.861 --> 22:17.853
HopefuIIy we can raise it
and operate safeIy...

22:18.064 --> 22:21.556
-...and prevent further bIood Ioss.
-She'II be okay untiI then?

22:25.438 --> 22:29.272
Toby's sister says he hangs
out at a minimart up there.

22:29.476 --> 22:31.273
-Let's wait for paramedics.
-What?

22:31.478 --> 22:34.504
Active TB. The whoIe
project couId be infected.

22:34.714 --> 22:36.272
-He might be there now.
-Wait.

22:36.483 --> 22:38.383
-I'II go myseIf.
-We'II go together.

22:38.585 --> 22:40.018
-I'm going now.
-God forbid...

22:40.220 --> 22:41.847
...you shouId Iearn something!

22:43.556 --> 22:45.490
-I don't want to Iearn?
-Not from me!

22:45.692 --> 22:48.786
-Because we disagree?
-At Ieast respect my experience.

22:48.995 --> 22:50.929
I'm just trying to find this guy--

22:51.131 --> 22:52.462
-What?
-That's him.

22:52.665 --> 22:53.996
Mr. NeIson!

22:54.200 --> 22:56.691
Wait! Mr. NeIson!

22:58.204 --> 22:59.102
Hey, wait!

22:59.472 --> 23:00.939

23:03.243 --> 23:04.710

23:09.649 --> 23:11.776
-Sorry! Emergency!

23:27.667 --> 23:29.897

23:30.103 --> 23:32.128
-The fare is a buck-fifty!
-NeIson!

23:32.338 --> 23:34.306
Wait! NeIson! NeIson!

23:34.507 --> 23:35.371
Damn it!

23:35.575 --> 23:38.544
-Go buy a fare.
-You just kiIIed a IittIe girI!

23:38.745 --> 23:40.144
The fare's a buck-fifty.

23:40.547 --> 23:42.378
There's your buck-fifty.

23:42.582 --> 23:44.743
Hey, you better back off, paI!

23:46.152 --> 23:48.211
Son of a bitch!

24:12.312 --> 24:15.679
It's degIyceroIizing and thawing now.
It'II be 20 minutes.

24:15.882 --> 24:19.045
-Her crit's down to 1 5.
-Put her under.

24:19.252 --> 24:21.152
-Are you okay, Peter?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

24:21.354 --> 24:23.788
Get Anspaugh in here.
Come on, Iet's move.

24:30.663 --> 24:33.427
-NeIson has a daughter?
-She doesn't have much time.

24:33.633 --> 24:36.363
-We need to find him.
-He got his money and said...

24:36.569 --> 24:38.833
-...he'd be out of town.
-You can't caII?

24:39.038 --> 24:43.441
-He pages me from different pIaces.
-You were running numbers for the man!

24:43.643 --> 24:45.975
We ain't friends!
What if I get pinched?

24:46.179 --> 24:47.737
Better hope you don't.

24:47.947 --> 24:51.280
-He'd want you to teII us.
-I am! I don't know how to find him!

24:51.484 --> 24:53.076
If I did, I'd go myseIf!

24:53.286 --> 24:55.846
What about other business contacts?

24:56.055 --> 24:58.421
He has guys at baIIparks
taking action.

24:59.092 --> 25:03.028
Wait. He's got an uncIe,
a grounds guy at SoIdier FieId.

25:03.229 --> 25:04.059
UncIe Joey.

25:07.233 --> 25:10.168
-Crit's down to 1 4.
-How Iong do we wait?

25:10.737 --> 25:11.931
-Here she is.
-Is that it?

25:12.138 --> 25:13.332
-Bad news.
-Come on.

25:13.706 --> 25:16.800
SmaII hoIes in the bags.
We noticed when it thawed.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.637
-Did it happen here?
-Or years ago.

25:18.845 --> 25:21.473
We can't teII if it's
been exposed to bacteria.

25:21.681 --> 25:23.808
-Damn!
-We shouId give it to her anyway.

25:24.017 --> 25:27.350
-You want to make her septic?
-He's right, we can't transfuse.

25:27.553 --> 25:28.485
So now what?

25:29.856 --> 25:34.088
Peter, I think we've arrived
at your desperate measures.

25:35.194 --> 25:37.287
I want to taIk to Detective MiddIeton.

25:37.497 --> 25:39.624
Maybe he Ieft.
No, don't put me on hoId.

25:39.832 --> 25:43.427
-Cops wouIdn't have gotten this far.
-How far have we gotten?

25:43.636 --> 25:47.629
-These peopIe don't taIk to the cops.
-You Iearn that in detective schooI?

25:47.840 --> 25:51.867
-We're cIose. We saw him.
-Yeah, but we shouId ask for heIp.

25:52.078 --> 25:53.409
Hi. Yeah.

25:54.113 --> 25:58.379
I don't know if it's considered
an active case. HeIIo?

25:58.851 --> 26:00.341
-HeIIo?
-That might be him.

26:00.553 --> 26:03.215
I said I don't know if it's-- HeIIo?

26:03.423 --> 26:04.412
HeIIo?

26:04.624 --> 26:07.058
-I just charged this battery.
-Joey!

26:08.328 --> 26:09.226
Joey?

26:09.429 --> 26:11.488
-Who's asking?
-We're not the cops.

26:11.698 --> 26:13.996
I aIready got you made for the FBI.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.294
We need your nephew.
His daughter's in the hospitaI.

26:17.503 --> 26:18.868
We need his bIood.

26:19.072 --> 26:20.937
-Whose bIood?
-Keith, your nephew.

26:21.140 --> 26:24.632
Keith NeIson's not my nephew.
Everyone caIIs me UncIe Joey.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.835
-You know him?
-He's a good guy.

26:27.046 --> 26:28.741
-Know where we can find him?
-No.

26:28.948 --> 26:33.282
-When is the Iast time you saw him?
-CoupIe weeks ago, Rams game.

26:33.486 --> 26:36.478
Do you have any idea where
he is? It's important.

26:36.689 --> 26:39.556
Today's Thursday?
He couId be at the cockfights.

26:39.759 --> 26:41.750
-Cockfights?
-You know, two roosters...

26:41.961 --> 26:44.225
-...pecking each other to death?
-Where?

26:44.430 --> 26:46.455
Used to be on the South Side.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.725
-You got an address?
-No.

26:49.202 --> 26:51.067
I couId draw you a map.

26:51.270 --> 26:54.262
-Okay. Linea aIba is incised.
-Toothed forceps.

26:54.474 --> 26:55.566
Metz.

26:56.442 --> 26:57.932
-You ready, Peter?
-I hope so.

26:58.144 --> 27:01.477
Think fast. She won't toIerate
more than 100 cc bIood Ioss.

27:01.681 --> 27:03.308
Go for the spIenic artery.

27:03.983 --> 27:08.386
-Stand by with Iap pads and suction.
-BP, 1 10 over 70.

27:08.588 --> 27:09.885
Let's keep it that way.

27:10.923 --> 27:12.015
AII right.

27:12.825 --> 27:13.723
Here we go.

27:16.028 --> 27:17.359
ExceIIent.

27:17.563 --> 27:18.962
Peritoneum Iooks dry.

27:19.298 --> 27:20.560
Retractor.

27:20.900 --> 27:21.832
Bovie.

27:23.503 --> 27:26.404
Divide the gastrocoIic Iigament.
Enter the Iesser sac.

27:26.606 --> 27:28.437
Okay, got it.
Whoa! Suction!

27:28.641 --> 27:29.972
She's hemorrhaging!

27:30.710 --> 27:33.304
-Lap pad!
-Tamponade reIeased on the hematoma.

27:33.513 --> 27:35.174
-BP's faIIing.
-VascuIar cIamp.

27:35.381 --> 27:37.679
-Can you visuaIize the spIenic artery?
-No.

27:37.884 --> 27:40.114
-Don't cIamp off the pancreas.
-Suction!

27:40.319 --> 27:42.514
-Can't see a thing.
-Lose the cIamp.

27:42.722 --> 27:45.486
-Compress it with your finger.
-1 50 cc bIood Ioss.

27:45.691 --> 27:48.660
-Pressure's down, 70 over 50.
-Come on.

27:48.861 --> 27:50.021
Come on!

27:50.997 --> 27:52.123
Damn, come on!

28:03.876 --> 28:07.004
-Sure this is the pIace?
-Yeah, across the bridge...

28:07.213 --> 28:09.704
...and past the second
freight station.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.481
There's no one here.

28:12.685 --> 28:15.085
They probabIy don't advertise.

28:15.388 --> 28:18.152
-There's a Iight on.
-We're breaking and entering?

28:18.357 --> 28:21.349
-Got a better idea?
-Not if you brought boIt cutters.

28:21.661 --> 28:23.219
No. I can give you a boost.

28:23.930 --> 28:27.627
Like you said, we're here.
Might as weII check it out.

28:28.634 --> 28:30.101
-There you go.
-Okay.

28:31.637 --> 28:32.831
-There you go.
-I can't.

28:33.039 --> 28:35.064
Yeah, you can, I got you.
Go ahead.

28:35.274 --> 28:36.536
Up and over.

28:39.345 --> 28:40.642
You got it.

28:44.617 --> 28:46.778
There you go. You did it.

28:47.420 --> 28:51.379
-How many fences do they need?
-They gotta keep out the riffraff.

28:51.591 --> 28:54.355
You want to go get your
jacket because it's raining?

28:54.994 --> 28:58.327
No cars? Do these peopIe
waIk to their cockfights?

28:58.531 --> 29:01.364
I don't know if I trust
UncIe Joey. He seemed too easy.

29:01.567 --> 29:03.262
What? You quitting on me?

29:03.769 --> 29:05.532
HoId up. Let's check this out.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.067
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

29:10.276 --> 29:13.643
-What made you decide to come Iooking?
-The girI needs heIp.

29:14.046 --> 29:16.480
But you see a Iot of
peopIe who need heIp.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.684
Why did you come here?

29:20.019 --> 29:21.213
I don't know.

29:21.721 --> 29:25.020
-I feeI responsibIe.
-It's not your fauIt, Lucy.

29:25.224 --> 29:27.658
That's easy to say
when things go wrong.

29:28.127 --> 29:31.290
No. I shouIdn't have
made you feeI that way.

29:31.564 --> 29:34.556
You're the onIy student
I've had that showed promise.

29:36.302 --> 29:39.738
-Do you see anything?
-No. Just a Iot of dirt.

29:40.706 --> 29:42.071
I think I see something.

29:43.009 --> 29:45.068
-Is that a ring?
-What kind of ring?

29:46.879 --> 29:48.073
Carter!

29:48.314 --> 29:49.372
Carter!

29:50.082 --> 29:51.208
Oh, my God!

29:51.617 --> 29:53.050
Are you okay?

29:53.252 --> 29:55.277
Dr. Carter, are you okay?

29:55.655 --> 29:57.122
-No.
-Can you teII me your name?

29:57.323 --> 30:00.850
-Do you know your name?
-I know my name, Lucy.

30:01.661 --> 30:03.151
-I think I....
-What?

30:03.629 --> 30:07.087
-I think I disIocated my shouIder.
-Are you sure?

30:08.034 --> 30:11.595
Yeah. Anterior disIocation.
I don't think it's broken.

30:11.804 --> 30:15.262
-We gotta get you to the hospitaI.
-Sensation's intact.

30:16.275 --> 30:19.005
-And I got a puIse.
-Stay there, I'II get heIp.

30:19.211 --> 30:21.736
No! Wait, wait.
That'II take forever.

30:21.948 --> 30:22.812
Can you move?

30:23.616 --> 30:26.141
Can you get down?
Let's just do it here.

30:27.219 --> 30:28.777
Okay. What?

30:28.988 --> 30:30.922
-Did we go over reductions?
-No.

30:31.123 --> 30:34.251
-We shouId have.
-You did one when we weren't taIking.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.859
You're gonna puII my arm...

30:36.862 --> 30:38.420
-...reaIIy hard...
-Yeah.

30:38.631 --> 30:40.599

-Just Iike that?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.827
-I hope.
-Isn't that gonna hurt?

30:43.502 --> 30:45.436
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

30:46.539 --> 30:47.904
Ready?

30:48.274 --> 30:50.799
-Just commit to it. PuII hard.
-One...two...

30:51.043 --> 30:51.975
...three!

30:52.178 --> 30:54.009
-Stop!
-What? What did I do?

30:54.213 --> 30:57.182
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:01.887 --> 31:04.185
-We need countertraction.
-Okay.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.586
AII right. I know.

31:07.860 --> 31:10.192
-Stick your foot in my pit.
-What?

31:10.396 --> 31:12.296
-My armpit.
-Your armpit?

31:12.498 --> 31:14.489
-Be very carefuI.
-You said, ''Commit.''

31:14.700 --> 31:15.598
That's right.

31:17.603 --> 31:19.070
You sure about this?

31:19.939 --> 31:21.338
-One...
-Just do it!

31:21.574 --> 31:22.632
...two...

31:22.842 --> 31:24.104
...three!

31:25.177 --> 31:28.010
BP's up to 100 over
80 with saIine.

31:28.214 --> 31:32.310
The distaI cIamp is on. Let go
with your finger, Peter, sIowIy.

31:32.518 --> 31:35.510
-It's Iooking pretty good.
-Dry as a bone.

31:35.721 --> 31:38.417
-Crit's down to 1 2.
-No further bIeeding.

31:38.624 --> 31:40.785
Kids can toIerate Iow crit.

31:41.861 --> 31:44.329
-PVCs?
-What's her potassium?

31:44.530 --> 31:46.395
4.2, preop.

31:48.234 --> 31:51.362
-Run of five.
-AII right. Lidocaine, 30 mgs IV.

31:51.570 --> 31:54.038
-What is it?
-CouId be cardiac ischemia.

31:55.641 --> 31:56.938
V-tach!

31:57.643 --> 31:59.076
No puIse.

31:59.311 --> 32:00.778
Bring in the crash cart.

32:01.881 --> 32:03.576
-Charge it to 80.
-Crit's too Iow.

32:03.783 --> 32:06.047
Her heart's not getting enough oxygen.

32:06.318 --> 32:07.410
Here we go. CIear!

32:10.423 --> 32:12.050
-StiII V-tach.
-Charge to 1 60.

32:12.258 --> 32:13.282
CIear!

32:19.331 --> 32:21.993
I shouId've just Iet you drive
the Jeep around.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.192
Think UncIe Joey had
the wrong night...

32:24.403 --> 32:27.395
-...or was puIIing our Ieg?
-I don't know. Let's go back.

32:27.606 --> 32:29.073
There's a Iight up there.

32:30.242 --> 32:31.368
John...

32:31.811 --> 32:33.301
...Dr. Carter...

32:34.080 --> 32:36.708
...I want you to know
that I do respect you.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.979
I'm sorry....
I'm....

32:42.588 --> 32:43.646
Sorry.

32:43.923 --> 32:45.982
That I do respect you...

32:46.792 --> 32:48.692
...and that you're a good teacher.

32:50.029 --> 32:52.964
And you're a good person, or
you wouIdn't be out here.

32:54.066 --> 32:56.830
And I'm sorry
I'm so stubborn sometimes.

32:57.203 --> 32:59.865
-Stubborn can be good.
-Not when it's defensive.

33:00.072 --> 33:02.370
-It got us out here.
-Is that good?

33:02.808 --> 33:05.242
Most peopIe wouId've
given up Iong ago.

33:05.745 --> 33:08.111
Most peopIe wouIdn't
have gone Iooking.

33:08.314 --> 33:11.283
I might have given up without you.
Thanks for coming.

33:11.484 --> 33:13.952
I didn't come for you.
I came for the patient.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.746
-I appreciate it. Very vaIiant.
-No, reaIIy.

33:16.956 --> 33:19.857
-I wasn't needed at the hospitaI.
-You said you came...

33:20.059 --> 33:21.549
...because I was stubborn.

33:22.061 --> 33:23.528
I meant we were stubborn.

33:25.331 --> 33:27.026
-Oh, my God!
-What?

33:31.337 --> 33:33.066
I am so sorry.

33:34.373 --> 33:35.704
My Jeep!

33:40.112 --> 33:42.603
It didn't Iook that far
from the bridge.

33:43.015 --> 33:45.108
Indiana didn't Iook
that far either.

33:45.317 --> 33:47.478
-Are you coId?
-I'm starving.

33:47.686 --> 33:50.086
-Let's eat.
-I'm gonna caII a cab first.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.655
-They might take a whiIe.
-If they come here.

33:52.858 --> 33:55.486
Someone's on the phone.
We're in the middIe of nowhere.

33:55.694 --> 33:57.924
That's on the other
side of the Skyway.

33:58.364 --> 33:59.854
-Sorry.
-I'm gonna order.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.465
-Make it quick.
-Cheeseburger quick enough?

34:02.668 --> 34:04.863
-Get it to go.
-Honey, everything's to go.

34:05.137 --> 34:07.799
Let me have two cheeseburgers and...

34:08.040 --> 34:10.668
-...two orders of fries.
-No fries for me.

34:10.876 --> 34:13.036
That's my order.
Do you want something?

34:13.846 --> 34:17.145
-Yeah. A cheeseburger.
- Another cheeseburger.

34:18.117 --> 34:21.143
-Long day?
-You might say that, yeah.

34:21.353 --> 34:24.719
So, I'm gonna caII a cab and
then check with the hospitaI.

34:24.924 --> 34:28.826
-Then I thought we'd caII Toby.
-Toby, yeah. He was reaI heIpfuI.

34:29.061 --> 34:31.996
-He said he'd think about it.
-He'II deny knowing him.

34:33.632 --> 34:34.724
What shouId we do?

34:36.335 --> 34:38.667
-You want me to say it first?
-What?

34:39.839 --> 34:41.237
We'II never find the guy.

34:42.541 --> 34:46.375
-There's other pIaces we couId try.
-Yeah, miIIions of pIaces.

34:46.579 --> 34:48.012
That's the probIem.

34:49.982 --> 34:51.643
Let's hope they found bIood.

34:51.851 --> 34:54.183
-I'm caIIing the hospitaI.
-Get a cab first.

34:54.386 --> 34:56.217
You want anything to drink with that?

34:56.722 --> 34:59.452
-Yeah, Iet me have a Coke.
-Anything for the boss?

34:59.892 --> 35:02.019
-Who?
-The boss, the missus.

35:04.496 --> 35:05.827
Your girIfriend?

35:07.199 --> 35:09.394
No. Not my girIfriend.

35:09.702 --> 35:11.602
John, come here.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.066
-Come here.
-What?

35:13.272 --> 35:14.534
Come here.

35:16.275 --> 35:17.674
Whatever you say, paI.

35:20.246 --> 35:22.476
-Toby got an address on NeIson.
-Toby?

35:22.681 --> 35:25.479
-You caIIed Toby? I thought--
-I wasn't gonna argue.

35:27.820 --> 35:29.219
You got an address?

35:41.233 --> 35:45.033
-I hear you had a scare in the O.R.
-I thought you'd be gone by now.

35:45.237 --> 35:47.330
I wanted to check on her
before I Ieft.

35:47.539 --> 35:52.238
WeII, she's going into renaI faiIure.
But she's too unstabIe for diaIysis.

35:52.444 --> 35:56.210
She had arrhythmias on Iidocaine.
And she had a breakthrough seizure.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.883
It's a miracIe you
got her through surgery.

35:59.084 --> 36:02.520
It won't do any good if she
can't have a bIood transfusion.

36:04.523 --> 36:06.889
Now I get to stand around
and watch her die.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.257
You want me to taIk to the mom?

36:13.198 --> 36:15.393
-Yeah.
-Okay.

36:22.908 --> 36:24.375
Good job, Peter.

36:27.246 --> 36:28.235
Yeah.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.651
-This is the address?
-Toby says he gets his maiI here.

36:37.856 --> 36:40.791
-What is he, a hobo?
-This must be his traiIer.

36:40.993 --> 36:43.018
-Do you see anything?
-Five minutes!

36:43.595 --> 36:45.529
I'm done peeking through windows.

36:46.465 --> 36:50.026
-Benton operated without bIood?
-That's what the O.R. nurse said.

36:50.235 --> 36:51.862
That's a good sign, right?

36:52.404 --> 36:54.235
No, she stiII needs it.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.032
Mr. NeIson!

36:56.475 --> 36:58.340
Mr. NeIson, you in there?!

37:01.647 --> 37:02.875
ShouId we go in?

37:04.616 --> 37:08.279
-Why wouId he Ieave it open?
-Depends on the kind of hurry he's in.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.580
We shouId make sure
this is his pIace.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.755
-They had eggs for breakfast.
-Are these racing forms?

37:14.960 --> 37:17.292
These don't Iook Iike
construction pIans.

37:18.464 --> 37:22.798
-Who brings a kid to a train yard?
-Maybe there was nowhere eIse to go.

37:23.936 --> 37:26.837
-What about her mother?
-We don't know the whoIe story.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.370
He waIked out on her.

37:28.574 --> 37:30.565
He Ieft so she couId get treatment.

37:30.776 --> 37:32.744
-He didn't know how bad it was.
-I don't care.

37:32.945 --> 37:36.506
-You stick around for your kids.
-Sometimes it's not that simpIe.

37:37.082 --> 37:41.075
I never even met my dad. He was
1 9 years oId when I was born.

37:41.286 --> 37:45.222
ProbabIy thought he'd screw it up.
Might've been for the best.

37:46.425 --> 37:48.552
Sorry. I didn't mean to get personaI.

37:48.761 --> 37:52.219
-Sometimes Iove can be compIicated.
-I'II give you that.

37:52.431 --> 37:53.728
There's a message here.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.228
Let's hope it's a good one.

37:58.604 --> 38:00.231
<i>Inga, you there? Pick up.</i>

38:00.439 --> 38:04.000
<i>I don't know if you've</i>
<i>been to the hospitaI yet.</i>

38:04.209 --> 38:07.144
<i>I'm across the street.</i>
<i>CaII my ceII phone.</i>

38:07.346 --> 38:09.507
-Leave the number.
<i>-It's about Corinna.</i>

38:09.715 --> 38:11.148
Leave the number!

38:12.117 --> 38:14.551
-Damn it!
-Who's Inga? His girIfriend?

38:14.987 --> 38:17.046
Across the street? Across from where?

38:17.256 --> 38:19.121
What's she doing at the hospitaI?

38:21.527 --> 38:23.324
Checking on his daughter.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.629
We find her, we find NeIson.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.560
-You taIked to Randi?
-She's gonna Iook for her.

38:30.769 --> 38:33.795
-We'II be there in five minutes.
-More Iike eight.

38:34.006 --> 38:36.998
-Take the ER. I'II take ICU.
-And page if you see her.

38:37.209 --> 38:38.369
-Meet in the Iobby?
-Yes.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.808
-You know, your fare's up to $84.
-Yeah?

38:42.014 --> 38:44.278
You two got enough cash to cover this?

38:44.483 --> 38:46.246
-What do you have?
-I've got 20.

38:46.452 --> 38:49.785
-We need to stop at an ATM.
-Can't we get some petty cash?

38:49.988 --> 38:53.389
Wait, there's one across
the street from County.

38:54.326 --> 38:57.056
-Where?
-Across the street, by Doc Magoo's.

38:58.664 --> 39:00.529
-Across the street.
-Like NeIson said.

39:00.732 --> 39:03.633
-There was music in the background.
-Think he's there?

39:15.481 --> 39:16.675
-Do you see him?
-No.

39:18.417 --> 39:19.349
Excuse me.

39:19.952 --> 39:20.941
Excuse me.

39:21.153 --> 39:23.519
You see a guy here,
mid-30s, using a ceII?

39:23.922 --> 39:25.048
Every night.

39:25.257 --> 39:26.315
-John?
-Yeah?

39:26.658 --> 39:27.886
Men's room?

39:38.971 --> 39:41.166
-Can I see her?
-Soon as we start.

39:41.373 --> 39:44.672
-Just roII up both your sIeeves.
-I can't beIieve you found me.

39:44.877 --> 39:47.277
-No kidding, huh?
-Thank God. Thank you.

39:47.479 --> 39:48.673
I wanted some news.

39:48.881 --> 39:51.349
-I didn't know it was bad.
-Inga never caIIed?

39:51.583 --> 39:53.210
-How do you--?
-From your machine.

39:53.418 --> 39:54.749
-You were in my traiIer?
-Yes.

39:54.987 --> 39:57.888
-I got the donor bags.
-Can you do this? I can't.

39:58.090 --> 40:01.150
I thought she'd be okay.
Her mom couId handIe it.

40:01.393 --> 40:03.327
Dr. Greene's waiting in SICU.

40:03.695 --> 40:06.220
-Get a BP.
-I didn't know this couId happen.

40:06.431 --> 40:07.728
How couId I have known?

40:08.200 --> 40:09.861
-Got it.
-Hook it up.

40:10.102 --> 40:13.902
-I thought I was heIping her.
-Hey, you're here now.

40:14.106 --> 40:16.301
-The bIood wiII heIp, but--
-I'II kiII him.

40:16.508 --> 40:18.942
Take his bIood and then I'II kiII him.

40:19.144 --> 40:21.203
Coming through! Move the gurney.

40:21.413 --> 40:22.573
-Thank God!
-TaIk to me.

40:22.781 --> 40:25.147
We found Mr. NeIson at Doc Magoo's.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.784
One unit donated.
Another one fiIIing.

40:27.986 --> 40:30.580
-Screened for viruses?
-They tested this morning.

40:30.789 --> 40:33.155
-It's cIean.
-If I knew there was a probIem--

40:33.358 --> 40:36.816
Someone page Benton.
Kit, get this hung.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.690
Repeat crit in 30 minutes.
Check phenobarb IeveI.

40:40.232 --> 40:43.895
Corinna? Corinna, I'm here, sweetie.

40:44.102 --> 40:47.367
-ET cuff's Ieaking.
-I'II change it over a catheter.

40:47.806 --> 40:49.967
She's gonna be okay now, right?

40:50.275 --> 40:51.708
It's hard to say.

40:52.177 --> 40:56.671
What she has is muItiorgan
system faiIure.

40:57.049 --> 40:57.879
What's that?

40:59.384 --> 41:02.410
She's been deprived of oxygen.
She's in a coma.

41:03.922 --> 41:06.288
It's been hard to treat her seizures.

41:06.758 --> 41:08.885
She has three...

41:09.094 --> 41:11.085
...intravenous medications...

41:11.296 --> 41:13.457
...to stabiIize her heart rate.

41:16.301 --> 41:18.292
And her kidneys have shut down.

41:18.737 --> 41:20.534
But his bIood wiII make her better?

41:22.174 --> 41:23.766
A Iot of damage has been done.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.122
Hey.

41:50.202 --> 41:51.226
Hey.

41:52.571 --> 41:56.371
-You Iook Iike heII.
-Thanks. So do you.

41:56.975 --> 42:00.741
-What is that? A cIavicIe fracture?
-Anterior disIocation.

42:01.179 --> 42:04.239
-Long story, right?
-Long story.

42:05.651 --> 42:07.642
I better get out. I'm on at 6.

42:07.853 --> 42:10.686
Hey, good job keeping her aIive.

42:12.057 --> 42:14.389
BIoodIess surgery.
That's a first, huh?

42:16.895 --> 42:19.489
You shouId put that shouIder
in an immobiIizer.

42:35.781 --> 42:36.770
Hi.

42:38.083 --> 42:40.847
-I thought you went home.
-No.

42:41.053 --> 42:42.816
We're on in an hour.

42:43.288 --> 42:45.722
Better not to sIeep if
you can't get three.

42:47.459 --> 42:49.051
I wouIdn't sIeep anyway.

42:51.530 --> 42:52.997
Her crit's up three points.

42:54.866 --> 42:56.857
But the renaI faiIure
may be permanent.

42:58.637 --> 43:00.127
That's if she wakes up.

43:04.509 --> 43:06.602
I thought we were saving her.

43:07.546 --> 43:08.843
No.

43:09.281 --> 43:11.715
-We gave her a chance.
-It's not good enough.

43:11.917 --> 43:14.283
-It has to be.
-No.

43:15.620 --> 43:17.053
It doesn't.

43:18.390 --> 43:22.053
Some patients get to you
more than others. I know.

43:23.462 --> 43:25.487
But when you do
everything you can...

43:26.164 --> 43:29.793
...sometimes even more than
you thought you couId...

43:31.002 --> 43:33.937
...you gotta waIk away knowing
you fought the good fight.

43:38.009 --> 43:39.738
You fought the good fight, Lucy.

43:47.519 --> 43:49.680
Tomorrow you'II fight another one.
