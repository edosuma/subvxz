<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:08.077
<i>The government has a secret system,</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:12.657
<i>a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:12.813 --> 00:14.986
<i>I designed The Machine
to detect acts of terror</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.855
<i>but it sees everything,</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:20.260
<i>violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:25.165
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant, we don't.</i>

00:25.325 --> 00:29.899
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.701
<i>You'll never find us,</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:36.439
<i>but victim or perpetrator,
if your number is up, we'll find you.</i>

00:44.745 --> 00:48.921

- Good. Let's begin.</i>

01:23.951 --> 01:28.161
He does that.
The man likes his privacy.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.649
You can't blame a girl for trying.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.673
Yeah.
It's for you.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.613
- Good morning, Miss Shaw.
- Morning.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.773
- Beautiful day for a walk.
- I suppose.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.339
When you finish yours, could you
join us back at the library?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.443
We have another number.

02:19.039 --> 02:22.543
- Det. Carter, right?
- Officer, actually.

02:22.709 --> 02:27.215
- Alonzo Quinn.
- Cal's godfather. Of course.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.523
I remember you from the funeral.
Your eulogy was beautiful.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.461
It wasn't hard to find good things
to say about Cal.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.703
Chief was keeping me apprised
of his case.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.533
Says they're looking at a couple
of Carl Elias' men as the shooters.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.734
- Yeah, heard that, too.
- You think otherwise?

02:47.901 --> 02:51.144
Not sure, but I think
there's more to it than that.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.153
Oh.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.152
- My shift is about to start, so...
- Don't let me hold you up.

02:58.311 --> 03:01.383
- It's nice seeing you again, Officer.
- You too. Take care.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.262
It's me.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.998
I think we might still have a problem
with Officer Caner.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.935
Hey, what's up?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.775
- Looking for news on Cal's case.
- I haven't heard any.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.407
- What about in the database?
Carter...

03:27.574 --> 03:30.350
Look, I'd check it myself
but you know they pulled my access.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.830
Yeah, and they'll pull mine, too,

03:31.997 --> 03:34.278
if they catch me poking around a case
I'm not assigned to.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.288
<i>- Come on, it's important.</i>
- Okay.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.598
- When it clears out a little.
- Thanks, Fusco.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.544
I've got our number, Finch.
What do you know about this guy?

03:54.701 --> 03:59.150
Wayne Kruger, 43, married,
internet entrepreneur,

03:59.272 --> 04:02.378
and founder of a company
called Lifetrace.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.385
And what's their business?

04:04.544 --> 04:07.491
<i>They market themselves
as a "people search" service,</i>

04:07.647 --> 04:11.322
where their users
can look up old friends or relatives,

04:11.485 --> 04:13.158
anyone they've fallen
out of touch with.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.731
Sounds harmless enough.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.266
There is, however,
more to it than that.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.563
Always is.

04:19.726 --> 04:22.263
<i>Kruger's business isn't really
about reconnecting people.</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:26.172
It's about collecting
and selling their information.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.644
- He's a data broker.
- What kind of data?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.942
Anything you would ever wanna know
about a person.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.676
Where they live, work, shop, eat,

04:34.841 --> 04:37.321
how much they earn,
how they vote and more.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.287
<i>Then he turns around and sells
the information to businesses,</i>

04:40.413 --> 04:43.019
individuals, even the government.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.856
- Is that legal?
- Technically.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.760
Data brokers get their information
from public records.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.027
But also from the ways
people reveal themselves online

04:51.191 --> 04:54.798
- whether they're aware of it or not.
- Sounds a little like your machine.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.033
A principle difference would be

04:59.199 --> 05:01.941
that the machine never reveals
any of its information,

05:02.102 --> 05:04.013
beyond a social security number.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.691
<i>So you're not a fan of Kruger's.</i>

05:05.816 --> 05:07.776
People like him are one
of the reasons I made sure

05:07.884 --> 05:10.153
The Machine
was an impenetrable black box.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.985
Kruger just entered his building.
He's in Shaw's hands now.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.286
I hope sending her in there
was a good decision.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.395
You doubt her ability to be discreet?

05:18.552 --> 05:21.556
I doubt her ability
to keep from shooting someone.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.046
<i>I'm in, Finch.</i>

05:46.913 --> 05:48.915
Kruger has got some kind
of big-shot meeting.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.134
<i>Gentlemen, we're thrilled
that you're considering us.</i>

05:55.158 --> 05:57.330
We know that River-ton
is a huge retailer

05:57.490 --> 05:59.993
and that you've got your pick
of potential data partners.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.231
Well, we've done our homework

06:02.395 --> 06:05.865
or rather Peter has done
our homework

06:06.032 --> 06:09.241
<i>and he says you're one of the
companies we should consider.</i>

06:09.402 --> 06:11.575
<i>I've looked
at all the information you provided,</i>

06:11.738 --> 06:15.550
including the company profile, growth
rate, consumer analytic statistics,

06:15.709 --> 06:19.020
- and data points per target.
- Congratulations.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.284
Go ahead.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.895
Any problems with your cover,
Ms. Shaw?

06:32.058 --> 06:35.437
Not unless someone asks me to type.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.906
- A baby rattle?
- Yeah.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.275
I apologize
if I spoiled the surprise.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.041
No, it's all right,

06:46.206 --> 06:52.122
it's just my wife and I haven't told
anybody outside the immediate family.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.781
How did you know?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.790
- Your wine consumption.
- Excuse me?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.389
It's dropped from two bottles a week

06:57.450 --> 06:59.130
to almost nothing
in the past three months,

06:59.154 --> 07:01.691
and your milk, yogurt and cheese
consumption has tripled.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.903
The grocery store where you shop.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.301
You're members
of their customer loyalty program.

07:08.461 --> 07:10.634
We created that.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.744
And I thought
they just sent out coupons.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.176
No. Programs like that are
just scratching the surface

07:16.336 --> 07:17.337
of what we can do.

07:17.504 --> 07:22.578
What we're really working towards
here at Lifetrace is the future.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.086
<i>A future where every person's needs
will be met</i>

07:25.245 --> 07:27.191
because we have
all the information necessary

07:27.347 --> 07:29.623
to meet those needs.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.127
Eating habits to predict diseases.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.131
Compatibility factors
to eliminate loneliness.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.769
And the way we do that
is by getting to know someone

07:38.925 --> 07:41.303
from the major events
of their lives

07:41.461 --> 07:44.772
right down to the tiniest detail
of their everyday routine.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.172
Learning everything about a person

07:47.334 --> 07:50.281
allows us to help them improve
their life.

07:50.437 --> 07:51.717
Sounds appealing, but can I ask,

07:51.871 --> 07:54.852
have you run into any issues
with respect to privacy concerns?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.715
<i>Nothing significant.</i>

07:56.876 --> 07:59.049
There are always a few
who take issue with what we do

07:59.212 --> 08:03.957
but these days, people know,
you can't fight the technology.

08:04.117 --> 08:09.396
And let's be honest, those crying
the loudest about privacy

08:09.556 --> 08:11.399
are probably the ones
trying to hide something.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.067
- That's why-Barry?
- Oh, yeah.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.665
That's why I put my own profile up
on our site.

08:18.832 --> 08:24.373
Anyone can look me up and see,
I've got nothing to hide.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.980
We'll need to work out a proposal
to present to our board.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.591
How would tomorrow morning
work for you?

08:35.815 --> 08:36.919
Sounds great.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.723
Whatever is going on with this guy,
it sure isn't hurting his business.

08:46.747 --> 08:49.233
I think it's time lo look
a little more closely at Mr. Kruger.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.900
People who say they have nothing
to hide almost always do.

09:02.008 --> 09:07.185
- Nothing comes up on his record.
- Well, thank you for checking.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.987
I understand you're back
on the day shift.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.585
Yeah, but I'm giving up something.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.096
- What's that?
- My patience.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.133
- Good morning.
- We'll see.

09:21.461 --> 09:22.741
Before we roll, I just wanna say

09:22.762 --> 09:24.842
I'm really looking forward
to working together and...

09:24.866 --> 09:28.752
Uh, Laskey, one,
I didn't wanna be an FTO

09:28.868 --> 09:30.313
but it beats being a vampire.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.575
Number two,

09:32.739 --> 09:35.276
when I tell you to do something,
just do it, no questions.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.988
And number three,
don't touch my radio, got it?

09:40.146 --> 09:45.061
- Yes, ma'am.
- Carter. Just Carter.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.334
How is it I got stuck
being the office monkey?

09:53.493 --> 09:56.599
I thought you liked being
in the middle of the action, Shaw.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.437
I think I'd see more action
in a tollbooth.

10:01.835 --> 10:07.513
- Ah! I was just emptying the trash.
- No problem.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.676
- I'll come back.
- Okay.

10:10.110 --> 10:10.850
<i>Tell the board
we 're meeting tomorrow.</i>

10:11.010 --> 10:13.149
<i>Sure thing, Mr. Kruger.</i>

10:13.313 --> 10:15.393
<i>Quite a stunt you pulled
with the baby rattle.</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:17.189
Well, I'd have told you about it

10:17.350 --> 10:19.956
but, uh, you'd have tried
to talk me out of it.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.758
You're right.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.641
- We need this deal.
- Well, we just got it.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.425
Come on, Barry.
This changes everything.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.764
This puts us on the map.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.234
- What is it, Haley?
- It's about the party tonight.

10:30.355 --> 10:32.636
I tried to put the restaurant deposit
on your credit card,

10:32.660 --> 10:34.436
- but it was declined.
- What? Why?

10:34.601 --> 10:36.774
I don't know,
the bank wouldn't tell me, I'm sorry.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.847
I'll handle it.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.909
You know, sometimes,
I wish I had an assistant

10:44.933 --> 10:48.121
whose qualifications extended
beyond having a great ass.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.659
I sure hope
this guy is a perpetrator.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.888
Wanna go to a party, Shaw?

10:53.052 --> 10:55.999
Only if you promise
to wear something pretty.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.986
Thanks. You.

11:21.047 --> 11:26.759
First, I wanna say it's great
of all of you to make it tonight,

11:26.920 --> 11:29.332
especially my wife Deedee.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.436
Mr. Reese, how is the Krugers' party?

11:32.592 --> 11:33.662
Delightful.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.362
Have you learned anything?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.769
Just that Kruger's got
a lot of friends,

11:37.931 --> 11:39.274
appears to be happily married...

11:40.733 --> 11:43.907
...and Shaw likes truffled
quail eggs.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.486
You can't expect me to shoot
somebody on an empty stomach.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.614
I'd prefer you didn't shoot
anyone at all.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.756
What about you, Finch?
Dig anything up?

11:51.911 --> 11:55.256
Yes. Kruger has gone to great lengths

11:55.415 --> 11:57.952
to suppress any bad publicity
about Lifetrace.

11:58.184 --> 12:02.724
Negative blog posts,
news articles,

12:02.889 --> 12:06.029
even a class action lawsuit
buried in non-disclosure agreements,

12:06.125 --> 12:08.969
<i>all scrubbed from the internet.</i>

12:09.128 --> 12:12.769
Sweetheart, I love you.
This is for you.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.118
Aw...

13:00.580 --> 13:02.787
<i>We got nothing to hide.
We got nothing to hide.</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:04.622
<i>I've got nothing to hide.</i>

13:06.119 --> 13:07.119
Turn it off.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.260
Turn it off now!
Tum it off!

13:13.693 --> 13:14.933
This somebody's idea of a joke?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.804
Deedee, honey, I have no idea...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.105
Mr. Reese?

13:22.268 --> 13:25.613
Yeah, someone just turned Kruger's
anniversary video into a sex tape.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.046
Oh, my.

13:27.206 --> 13:30.551
Sweetie, listen, I...

13:37.450 --> 13:38.986
What are you all looking at?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.829
Go home. The party is over.
Party is over!

13:49.662 --> 13:51.539
Just when things
were getting interesting.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.201
I know, first his credit cards,
now this.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.244
<i>Someone is messing with Kruger,
Finch.</i>

13:56.402 --> 13:58.211
Well, The Machine wouldn't send us
his number

13:58.371 --> 14:00.373
if someone just wanted
to humiliate him.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.180
No, we need to find
whoever is behind this

14:02.241 --> 14:03.561
before they come after him again.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.884
Or before Kruger finds them first.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.027
There's a reason...

14:21.427 --> 14:24.738
- Finch.
- Ms. Shaw. Is everything all right?

14:24.897 --> 14:28.777
Don't sound so worried, Harold.
I haven't hurt anybody. Yet.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.135
Very reassuring.
You have news?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.777
I think I know who hijacked
Kruger's anniversary party.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.681
<i>Here's the restaurant's security
camera footage from last night.</i>

14:38.111 --> 14:39.886
<i>A woman dressed as a waiter.</i>

14:40.046 --> 14:41.957
None of the wait staff
had seen her before.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.458
Well, I might have.

14:43.616 --> 14:47.223
I've been through all the parties
to the class action suit against Kruger.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.458
All of them claim
to have been victimized

14:49.622 --> 14:52.125
when their personal information
was released by Lifetrace.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.361
Victimized how?

14:53.526 --> 14:57.565
Identity theft, harassment,
blackmail, fraud.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.142
- Even murder.
- Who?

15:00.299 --> 15:04.372
Chloe Harper, daughter
of the lead plaintiff, Sherry Harper.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.914
She lost her life to a stalker

15:06.072 --> 15:08.211
who found her home address
using Lifetrace.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.217
No wonder
Kruger wanted the suit buried.

15:10.376 --> 15:13.721
Det. Fusco's running background
checks on all of the plaintiffs now.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.927
Wait, I just found
our mystery waiter.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.843
Her name is Karen Mills.
She lives in Queens.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.494
- I'm on my way.
<i>- No, stay put, Ms. Shaw.</i>

15:21.654 --> 15:23.930
<i>I'll see if Det. Carter can help us.</i>

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
What did she do?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.676
- Rolled a stop.
- Really?

15:42.975 --> 15:47.253
Stay in the car.
I got this.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.461
License and registration, please.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.772
Something wrong, Officer?
- You could say that.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.376
Why are you coming
after Wayne Kruger?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.954
Don't make me ask twice, Ms. Mills.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.124
I... I got a package.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.887
- A package? From who?
- I don't know.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.496
It was anonymous.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.189
There was a DVD
and some instructions on what to do

16:29.355 --> 16:30.595
if I wanted to get back at him.

16:30.723 --> 16:35.638
- Why? What did he do to you?
- He ruined my life.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.403
How?

16:40.399 --> 16:47.078
I was a paralegal at a law firm.
It's where I met my fiancé.

16:47.240 --> 16:52.849
One day, some of the assistants were
looking people up on this website,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.047
Lifetrace.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.551
- They found some pictures.
- What kind of pictures?

17:01.320 --> 17:07.167
They were taken by an ex-boyfriend,
of us, in his bedroom.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.567
And everyone saw them.

17:09.729 --> 17:15.873
My fiancé,
he called off our engagement.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.050
When I got the package,

17:21.207 --> 17:24.551
I saw a chance to make Kruger feel
the humiliation that I felt.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.384
So I took it.

17:32.752 --> 17:37.428
Okay. I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time, Ms. Mills.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.463
So long as you take that package
you got.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.734
Take it to a Det. Lionel Fusco
at the 8th Precinct

17:45.898 --> 17:48.435
and you promise me you'll never do
anything like that again.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.548
Thank you.
I won't, Officer.

17:51.704 --> 17:58.121
Good, because the NYPD will know.
Trust me.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.156
Hope you got that.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.163
- Mr. Reese?
- I heard.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.922
Doesn't sound like
she had anything to do

18:10.923 --> 18:12.334
with the other attacks on Kruger.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.734
Likely done by whoever sent
the anonymous package.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.911
<i>Look, baby, I know you're mad,
but I need you to call me back.</i>

18:21.067 --> 18:22.747
<i>The bank says
our cards have been cancelled</i>

18:22.771 --> 18:26.308
and our accounts emptied out.
Something is wrong. Just call me.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.510
Haley, will you get my accountant
on the line?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.195
What are you doing?
What's the problem?

18:31.310 --> 18:33.085
My Problem?

18:33.245 --> 18:34.815
First saved message.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.541
<i>You know,
sometimes, I wish I had an assistant</i>

18:37.565 --> 18:41.026
<i>whose qualifications extended
beyond having a great ass.</i>

18:41.187 --> 18:43.326
- Where did that come from?
- You, apparently.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.935
Someone is using Kruger's
own words against him.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.594
His office must be bugged.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.604
Screw you, Wayne.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.106
Mr. Hayes?

19:00.706 --> 19:05.780
Mr. Collier.
Mr. Collier, what's going on?

19:07.680 --> 19:11.025
Well, in light
of recent developments,

19:11.183 --> 19:14.460
Mr. Deaver doesn't think Lifetrace
is the best partner for us after all.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.491
- Excuse me.
- Look...

19:20.826 --> 19:22.737
This is getting better by the minute.

19:23.896 --> 19:27.901
- What the hell happened?
- I was hoping you could tell me.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.878
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You got to take the site down.

19:35.041 --> 19:39.012
We already did
but not before Riverton saw it.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.179
They yanked the deal!

19:40.346 --> 19:42.758
Oh, I cannot believe
this is happening!

19:42.915 --> 19:45.759
You never said you went bankrupt
or had a DUI.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.194
That was over ten years ago.
It was expunged.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.492
Is this an arrest warrant?

19:49.655 --> 19:53.501
I was in college. It was dismissed.
Look, this is all ancient history.

19:53.659 --> 19:56.196
Well, it's new to us
and to Riverton.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.242
Someone is screwing with me.
Can't you see that?

19:59.932 --> 20:04.278
Wayne, we think it might be best
if you took some time

20:04.437 --> 20:06.781
to sort out your personal issues.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.750
If I took some time?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.856
A leave of absence
while we evaluate our options.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.686
"While you evaluate your options"?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.122
This is my company, Barry!

20:17.283 --> 20:21.129
And you're the face of it.
And that's now a problem.

20:25.124 --> 20:29.197
- Okay, look...
- We already took a vote.

20:34.433 --> 20:38.074
Fine. Fine.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.605
But I'm gonna find out
who's doing this to me.

20:42.541 --> 20:48.981
And then, I'm gonna call Riverton.
I'm gonna fix this.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.651
Looks like Kruger has just been
kicked out of his own company.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.991
Things are escalating
with Kruger, Finch.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.929
We any closer
to finding the perpetrator?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.568
I'm working on it, Mr. Reese.

21:18.344 --> 21:22.156
- Hello.
<i>- You've hurt many people.</i>

21:22.314 --> 21:25.022
- What? Who is this?
- <i>You need to understand.</i>

21:26.185 --> 21:28.028
Understand what?

21:28.154 --> 21:31.033
You listen to me. If I find out
you're the one responsible...

21:36.462 --> 21:37.839
on!

21:42.368 --> 21:43.728
The elevator is freefalling.

21:43.752 --> 21:45.512
Modern elevators do not freefall,
Ms. Shaw.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.843
Tell that to Kruger.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.483
You can't fight the technology.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.319
Somebody has disabled
the auto-safety features.

21:56.515 --> 21:59.155
The elevators aren't networked.
I can't access them.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.670
Kruger made it out, Finch.

22:48.834 --> 22:53.374
Whoever's coming after him has taken
his company, his money, his marriage.

22:53.539 --> 22:56.952
Soon the only thing left to take
will be his life.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.865
Finch,
the call he got in the elevator,

23:08.020 --> 23:10.022
- could you trace it?
- No.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.470
But whoever hijacked the elevator
would have needed access

23:12.524 --> 23:14.526
to the building's electrical room.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.139
I do know who cleaned out
Kruger's bank accounts.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.401
- Who?
- <i>Dennis Paulson.</i>

23:19.565 --> 23:22.739
Det. Fusco got his photo off
the phoney ID he used

23:22.902 --> 23:25.382
to cash out Kruger's accounts.

23:25.537 --> 23:29.144
He's another member of the
class action suit against Kruger,

23:29.308 --> 23:30.787
same as Ms. Mills.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.150
Then were looking
at multiple perpetrators.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.452
Yes. Paulson lost his job

23:36.615 --> 23:40.085
and was arrested
after Lifetrace conflated his profile

23:40.252 --> 23:43.722
with that of a serial rapist
who happened to have the same name.

23:43.889 --> 23:46.335
Hate it when that happens.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.997
Paulson told Fusco
he'd received the fake ID

23:50.162 --> 23:53.575
and Kruger's banking information
in an anonymous package.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.104
Same as Karen Mills.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.308
Someone is giving these victims
everything they need

23:58.332 --> 24:00.913
- to get back at Kruger.
- It's turnkey revenge.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.848
How many people in that class action?

24:03.008 --> 24:05.955
Over 200,
23 in the tri-state area.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.422
- Finch, we can't stop that many.
- It'd be fun trying.

24:09.581 --> 24:12.187
I got to ask, though,
is this guy even worth our time?

24:12.351 --> 24:14.151
You know,
that's not a question we entertained

24:14.175 --> 24:15.677
when we saved you, Ms. Shaw.

24:17.022 --> 24:19.628
Our only chance to save Kruger
is to find him.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.272
<i>I'm sending you his coordinates.</i>

24:26.465 --> 24:28.865
<i>Yeah, he's off radio.
I'm gonna get him the message.</i>

24:28.889 --> 24:30.710
<i>- Oh, hey, great.
- Looks like his own blood.</i>

24:30.869 --> 24:32.815
Guy is a member
of the Northside Killas.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.714
Dang, got shot up pretty bad.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.329
- Who do you think did this?
- Hard to say.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.985
I'd talk
to his regular customers first,

24:42.147 --> 24:43.956
see who he was having problems with.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.562
But that's not our job.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.357
We just secure the scene

24:48.520 --> 24:51.558
- and take the statements.
- Right.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.473
- First body?
- Yeah.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.907
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.648
Rookies.

25:16.248 --> 25:20.321
- I don't know what happened.
- No? Take a look at your shoes.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.224
Just suck on the ice.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.033
- Hey.
- Hey. You find anything?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.266
I haven't looked yet.
Hang on.

25:40.606 --> 25:41.880
Let's see.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.347
Whoa.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.023
- What is it?
- The file has been frozen.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.286
- What? Why?
- Why do you think?

25:51.450 --> 25:52.861
Probably too many prying eyes.

25:54.053 --> 25:59.526
Hey, I'm feeling a little better
so if you wanna get back to it...

26:00.926 --> 26:03.304
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.314
Okay, Finch, I've got him.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.581
Mr. Collier,
it's Wayne Kruger again.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.988
I'm really hoping that we can meet
before you leave town

26:23.148 --> 26:25.094
<i>so I can explain the confusion
earlier today.</i>

26:25.250 --> 26:27.992
If you give me a chance,
I'm sure we can sort this all out...

26:35.060 --> 26:38.098
<i>Those crying the loudest
about privacy</i>

26:38.263 --> 26:40.103
<i>are probably the ones
trying to hide something.</i>

26:48.574 --> 26:50.576
- Finch.
- They've hacked the car.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.822
You can't fight the technology.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.587
Someone is overriding the vehicle's
electronic control unit.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.627
You can't fight the technology.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.506
<i>Mr. Reese, they can take control
of his steering and throttle.</i>

27:39.992 --> 27:41.869
Bet you could use a lift.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.756
- Where am I?
- Somewhere you won't be attacked

28:01.914 --> 28:03.552
by the people who are trying
to kill you.

28:03.715 --> 28:07.720
- And you are?
- Right now, your only option.

28:11.657 --> 28:16.402
- My car, what happened?
- This electronic control unit.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.542
It overrode your car's internal ECU

28:18.697 --> 28:21.439
allowing someone to control
the vehicle's functions remotely.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.908
Someone who?

28:23.068 --> 28:25.708
One of the members of that class
action suit brought against you.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.511
That suit?
My lawyers settled that.

28:28.674 --> 28:31.348
Not to everyone's satisfaction,
it would seem.

28:33.679 --> 28:36.956
- Oh, that's interesting.
- What?

28:37.115 --> 28:39.288
Chloe Harper, the young woman
killed by her stalker.

28:39.451 --> 28:42.171
Her mother was lead plaintiff but
there was no mention of her father.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.894
I just looked him up, Stu Sommers.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.697
Different last name than Chloe's.
Divorced?

28:47.859 --> 28:49.702
I remember that man
from your building.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.400
He was posing as a janitor.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.479
Yeah, Carl,
hasn't been around that long.

28:58.971 --> 29:00.211
Because until three months ago,

29:00.235 --> 29:02.641
he worked as an electrical engineer
at an aerospace firm.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.152
With a pedigree like that,
he would have the skills

29:05.310 --> 29:07.984
to design these sophisticated attacks.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.317
We need to find him.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.622
He must be staying
somewhere in the city.

29:13.785 --> 29:17.665
His personnel file,
it would have to have an address.

29:17.823 --> 29:18.995
I can call tomorrow morning.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.297
- Not necessary.
- Well...

29:25.163 --> 29:26.801
Are you hacking
my buildings servers?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.476
Do you mind?

29:34.973 --> 29:38.318
Carl Miller, 162 Willow Street,
apartment 4, Brooklyn.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.317
He'll either be there
or he'll be at Lifetrace,

29:40.483 --> 29:41.963
where he has access to the computers.

29:41.987 --> 29:44.651
Planning his next attack.
I'll check it out.

29:44.816 --> 29:45.817
I'll hit the apartment.

29:50.589 --> 29:55.129
Perhaps you should rest, Mr. Kruger.
You've had quite a day.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.197
Hm...

30:12.878 --> 30:14.158
Got anything to eat around here?

30:14.179 --> 30:18.685
Just Sencha green tea.
And a box of doggie treats.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.822
I don't suppose what you're working
on over there concerns me.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.626
I'm trying to triangulate
the location

30:24.790 --> 30:27.236
of the call you received
in the elevator.

30:27.392 --> 30:29.895
Did you recognize anything
about the caller?

30:31.063 --> 30:32.701
No, nothing.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.579
Please enter your...

30:41.707 --> 30:43.243
I'd prefer you didn't do that.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.413
I'd prefer you mind
your own business.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.320
That's a tad ironic
coming from a man of your profession.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.824
Meaning what?

30:50.982 --> 30:53.826
Meaning your business
is minding everyone else's business.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.198
I do what I do to simplify
and improve other people's lives.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.358
What is it that you do?

30:59.524 --> 31:02.232
We help people out
of difficult situations,

31:02.394 --> 31:04.374
even situations of their own design.

31:04.529 --> 31:08.170
So it's my fault
that some wacko's trying to kill me?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.574
The man lost his daughter,
Mr. Kruger,

31:10.736 --> 31:12.943
to a stalker who was aided
by your service.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.448
You feel no accountability?

31:14.606 --> 31:18.076
I'm part
of a 300 billion dollar a year industry.

31:18.243 --> 31:21.122
Information abuses are unfortunate,
but they happen, cant be helped.

31:21.279 --> 31:25.284
Oh, they can, but only if the people
who have access to the information

31:25.450 --> 31:28.727
are as interested in protecting it
as they are in profiting from it.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.628
I was just checking to see
if my wife had called.

31:34.793 --> 31:37.740
I wanted to make sure she was okay.

31:37.896 --> 31:38.897
Mr. Kruger,
I didn't want you using the phone

31:39.064 --> 31:40.634
because it might not be safe,

31:40.799 --> 31:42.540
but if you must check your messages,

31:42.701 --> 31:46.148
we can go through
your phone carrier's web portal.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.215
Need my password?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.752
- You have a message.
<i>- Mr. Kruger, Pete Collier.</i>

31:52.911 --> 31:55.751
<i>I spoke with my colleagues and they
agreed we should all sit down again.</i>

31:55.881 --> 31:58.225
<i>If you could meet us
at the Mayfield at 9:30,</i>

31:58.383 --> 32:00.590
<i>that should give us enough time
before our flight.</i>

32:00.752 --> 32:02.272
<i>We'll meet you
in the east dining room.</i>

32:02.296 --> 32:04.600
Yes, yes, if I leave now,
I can still make it.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.794
- And what about your wife?
- I'll call her on the way.

32:09.227 --> 32:12.333
Mr. Kruger, wait. The message,
it's not labeled as "New."

32:13.598 --> 32:16.511
Someone else
must have listened to it first.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.171
Who?
Oh, Sommers!

32:19.337 --> 32:21.937
And if he's listened to it,
he'll be waiting for you at the hotel.

32:21.961 --> 32:23.949
- It's too dangerous.
- I don't care.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.316
There's too much riding on this deal.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.700
All right, I'll contact my associates,

32:29.724 --> 32:31.601
then have them meet us
at the hotel.

32:46.031 --> 32:50.707
Okay, okay, Bear. Goodness.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.725
- Finch.
- Mr. Reese.

33:11.890 --> 33:15.531
Kruger is gone. I made the mistake
of turning my back on him.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.698
- Are you all right?
- I will be.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.809
It would appear
that Bear slowed Kruger down.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.972
<i>He's making his way
to the Mayfield Hotel</i>

33:27.138 --> 33:29.243
<i>to take a meeting
with the Riverton people.</i>

33:29.407 --> 33:32.388
<i>I believe that Summers knows that
as well.</i>

33:32.544 --> 33:34.490
I'm at his locker now.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.494
He's been stalking Kruger just like
his own daughter was stalked.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.259
And ultimately killed.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.861
I'll get over to the Mayfield.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.743
Something else, Mr. Reese.

33:53.899 --> 33:57.676
Kruger is not only
a potential victim,

33:57.836 --> 34:00.112
he may also now be a perpetrator.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.118
<i>I cannot believe
this is happening!</i>

34:04.276 --> 34:06.620
<i>Someone is screwing with me.
Can't you see that?</i>

34:06.778 --> 34:08.121
<i>I'm gonna fix this.</i>

34:20.425 --> 34:22.962
Looking for someone?
Easy.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.773
I won't miss at this range.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.205
So what was the plan? Hm?

34:30.368 --> 34:32.541
Were you gonna take me out before
or after my meeting?

34:34.371 --> 34:35.543
I hadn't decided yet.

34:35.706 --> 34:38.654
You know, you've caused me
a great deal of pain

34:38.810 --> 34:42.155
- and suffering, Mr. Sommers.
- That was the point.

34:42.313 --> 34:47.764
Well, now you're gonna help me
get it all back.

34:52.724 --> 34:55.000
Mr. Kruger, you got my message.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.140
What happened to you?

34:59.297 --> 35:04.007
Oh, you know,
I'm really glad you asked.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.773
Where's the rest of your team?

35:05.937 --> 35:08.008
Unfortunately,
they had to catch an earlier flight.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.586
They send their regrets.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.349
- Hello.
- Oh, yeah. This is Mr. Sommers.

35:14.512 --> 35:17.083
Look, I thought
we were gonna discuss our deal.

35:17.248 --> 35:20.821
Yes, well,
shortly after I called you,

35:20.986 --> 35:23.865
we attempted to revisit the issue
with our CEO,

35:24.022 --> 35:27.196
but we couldn't get him
to reconsider his decision.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.100
- What?
- I'm sorry.

35:29.260 --> 35:33.037
I thought a face-to-face would be
better than another phone call.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.009
- No.
- Excuse me?

35:36.167 --> 35:37.202
No!

35:38.303 --> 35:40.343
You have no idea
what I've been through to get here!

35:40.472 --> 35:41.951
Mr. Kruger, why do you have a gun?

35:42.107 --> 35:46.783
Because this man humiliated me,
stole from me

35:46.945 --> 35:47.985
and even tried to kill me.

35:49.114 --> 35:52.391
It was his twisted little game
that made our deal fall apart.

35:52.550 --> 35:55.121
- Tell him.
- Okay, just, let's put down the gun.

35:55.286 --> 35:56.356
I said tell him!

36:01.493 --> 36:04.133
Don't do it, Mr. Sommers.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.636
Who are you?

36:07.799 --> 36:10.245
Someone who knows what this is about.

36:13.238 --> 36:15.047
Chloe.

36:16.975 --> 36:20.718
Then you know he killed her
and something had to be done.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.079
I never touched your daughter.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.889
You may not have put your hands
on her like that monster did

36:25.050 --> 36:26.927
but you're just as guilty.

36:27.085 --> 36:31.431
- I didn't do anything!
- Exactly.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.500
See, her ex-boyfriend
found her three times.

36:34.559 --> 36:37.039
Three times using your Lifetrace.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.000
<i>And every time he found her,</i>

36:40.165 --> 36:43.874
we asked the company
to take her information down

36:44.035 --> 36:45.912
and they didn't do it.

36:46.071 --> 36:49.348
And so he found her again and again

36:49.507 --> 36:51.509
until the last time
when he killed her.

36:53.244 --> 36:58.523
All because you and your company
didn't do anything.

37:02.854 --> 37:09.533
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

37:09.694 --> 37:13.437
Yeah?
Sorry isn't good enough.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.373
Listen to me, Stu.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.948
You do this and your life,
it's over.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.414
It's already over.

37:22.574 --> 37:27.148
Stu, this isn't the way
to honor your daughter's memory.

37:27.312 --> 37:30.953
Think about it.
What would Chloe want?

37:48.933 --> 37:52.676
You did the right thing.
For both of you.

37:54.806 --> 37:58.185
Mr. Reese, I triangulated the call
that Kruger received in the elevator.

37:58.343 --> 38:00.619
<i>It's now coming
from inside the Mayfield.</i>

38:00.812 --> 38:02.758
Ah!

38:03.848 --> 38:05.452
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

38:06.918 --> 38:09.660
You were right.
Something had to be done,

38:09.821 --> 38:12.165
which is why we reached out
to you, Mr. Sommers.

38:14.259 --> 38:17.797
You did it.
You sent me the package.

38:17.962 --> 38:22.433
We sent you the means
to exact justice for your daughter,

38:22.600 --> 38:25.774
and you had the courage to act.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.482
Unfortunately,
the car crash wasn't successful.

38:31.643 --> 38:36.683
Requiring this improvisation
but everything worked out in the end.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.156
You should go now, Mr. Sommers.

38:50.328 --> 38:54.299
- I think you understand now.
Understand what?

38:55.733 --> 39:00.079
What is lost
when your privacy's stripped away.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.411
Your identity, your job,

39:05.577 --> 39:11.926
your family, security, everything.

39:13.318 --> 39:17.164
- You.
<i>- And thousands more just like me.</i>

39:17.322 --> 39:21.168
People who have chosen
action over apathy

39:21.326 --> 39:24.239
to take back what men like you

39:24.395 --> 39:29.105
and the government have stolen.

39:32.537 --> 39:37.885
This wasn't a game, Mr. Kruger,
this was a lesson, the first.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.422
We were just gonna scare you but...

39:43.214 --> 39:46.218
...that wouldn't change anything,
would it?

39:55.460 --> 39:57.440
- Finch.
- John, are you shot?

39:57.595 --> 39:59.370
My vest caught it.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.033
- <i>Think my rib is broken.</i>
- And Kruger?

40:05.803 --> 40:06.873
He's dead, Finch.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.245
I got him. Can you walk?

40:13.411 --> 40:17.052
- I need to get to Collier.
- We've got to get you out of here.

40:17.215 --> 40:20.594
She's right, Mr. Reese.
Another time.

40:36.935 --> 40:40.144
- Back for more, huh?
- I need to say something.

40:41.239 --> 40:44.413
Can it wait
until after you buy me coffee?

40:44.575 --> 40:47.112
I know you had to take a partner
to get back on days

40:47.278 --> 40:48.916
but did you know
that two other rookies

40:49.080 --> 40:51.356
were supposed to be in this seat
before me?

40:51.516 --> 40:52.961
And both requested to be reassigned.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.620
If you want another FTO
just say the word.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.200
No, that's the point,
I didn't ask to be reassigned

40:59.357 --> 41:02.998
because I chose you.
- Chose me? Why?

41:05.029 --> 41:07.771
In the academy, I heard about you.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.502
Your work
with the Homicide task force

41:09.667 --> 41:12.944
and how you took down
those corrupt cops.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.380
I thought,
"Someday, that's what I wanna do."

41:15.540 --> 41:18.783
That's why I jumped
at the chance to train under you.

41:18.943 --> 41:22.481
But I don't get the sense
that you wanna train anybody

41:22.647 --> 41:26.322
and if that's the case, then I'd
prefer it if you just cut me loose.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.560
<i>Three Adam-10,
report of a 1053 near Morris and...</i>

41:43.368 --> 41:46.349
Roger, dispatch.
Three-Adam-10 responding.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.825
<i>I made a call
to Riverton's home office.</i>

42:01.986 --> 42:06.662
Seems Collier, no doubt an alias,
has not returned to work.

42:06.824 --> 42:08.064
And I don't think he will.

42:08.226 --> 42:11.935
He started four months ago
as VP of Customer Analytics,

42:12.096 --> 42:14.336
a position that allowed him
to get close enough to Kruger

42:14.360 --> 42:16.769
so that he could both witness
and participate

42:16.934 --> 42:19.744
in the dismantling of his life.

42:19.904 --> 42:21.906
He told Kruger
there were others like him.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.553
Yes, and I'm inclined to believe him.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.710
I discovered
that the anonymous packages

42:25.877 --> 42:27.618
sent to Mr. Sommers and the others

42:27.779 --> 42:31.522
came through mail-processing centers
scattered all over the country.

42:31.682 --> 42:32.842
Could've saved on the postage

42:32.850 --> 42:34.921
and just shot him
when they had the chance.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.222
I'm just saying
it was an elaborate plan.

42:39.246 --> 42:40.816
It wasn't just about killing Kruger.

42:41.859 --> 42:44.772
It was about giving the people
he hurt a chance at retribution.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.401
And also putting an ideology
into action.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.480
Collier referred to Kruger's murder
as a lesson.

42:52.637 --> 42:53.775
The first.

42:56.407 --> 43:00.719
I fear that whatever his
organization's ultimate goals may be,

43:00.878 --> 43:03.915
this could be just the beginning.
