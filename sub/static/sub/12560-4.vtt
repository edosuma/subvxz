00:00.490 --> 00:01.609
I'm hank.

00:01.680 --> 00:04.600
I was your typical emergency room doctor...

00:04.670 --> 00:05.830
Until I got fired.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.910
You let a billionaire hospital trustee die to save some kid off the street.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.740
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:10.860 --> 00:11.960
This is my brother.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.680
I'm evan R.Lawson,C.P.A.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.140
He took me away from my troubles and to the hamptons,

00:17.610 --> 00:20.990
and suddenly,I had a chance to become a whole newkind of doctor.

00:21.070 --> 00:25.670
Turns out the wealthyand not-so-wealthy out here could use a guywho makes house calls,

00:25.830 --> 00:29.380
so I got a second chanceto do what I do best.

Pizza... get this...pizza out.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.360
Pizza?

01:40.440 --> 01:41.510
You asked for pasta.

01:41.590 --> 01:46.500
Yeah,that's what I said-- peppers,pickles,pie crusts.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.470

Valentina,the pappardelle.Yeah?

You're up early.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.760
I know.

02:35.830 --> 02:41.410
Well,I figure-- if I'm going to expandhankmed's clientele,

02:41.490 --> 02:42.970
I got to join a country club.

02:43.010 --> 02:44.970
'Cause that's where they keepall the rich people out here.

02:45.050 --> 02:47.100
And I can't join a clubuntil I have a sport.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.190
A,uh--a networking milieu,if you will.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.480
I won'T.Bam.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.110
Did boris say you could usehis tennis equipment?

02:56.150 --> 03:00.570
You said--I'm goingto quote you right now-- you said that unless it'san emergency,leave boris alone.

03:00.610 --> 03:03.960
Yeah,includingall of his property,facilities,and leisure gear.

03:04.830 --> 03:07.890
Interesting,I must've tunedthat part of the lecture out.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.900
- Fine.- Thank you.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.380
- All right,cover for metill I get back.- Sure.

03:13.450 --> 03:17.150
And don't change my ringtone to you rapping,no crank calls,no pizza deliveries.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.130
- Charitable donations?- No,nothing.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.030
Okay.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.930
We have to discuss sunday.

03:23.050 --> 03:25.480
I... hank fest,man.That's a working title,by the way.

03:25.590 --> 03:28.110
It's a bad title,andI don't want to discuss sunday.

03:28.150 --> 03:31.260
That's too bad.I already made ressies at the seven hottest clubsin the hamptons,

03:31.340 --> 03:33.470
with,like,cabanas and bottle service.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.440
And I rented us a limowith a scent machine in it.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.410
I have no idea what that is,but I got a really good deal.

03:38.490 --> 03:39.790
Evan,I'm serious.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.790
My weddingwas canceled,remember?

03:41.870 --> 03:43.090
What do you mean do I--of course I remember.

03:43.170 --> 03:46.870
It doesn't meanthat any and all festivities associated with ithave to be canceled.Come on.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.110
Hank apalooza!Yes,hankapalooza,that's perfect.

03:49.170 --> 03:50.680
Wait.How about nothing-palooza?

03:50.950 --> 03:53.780
- Honestly,henry,and I mean this...- yeah?

03:53.860 --> 03:56.540
I'm not gonna let you spend your ex-wedding daymoping around.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.000
I'm not gonna do it.So you got to do something.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.580
I thinkI'll just take sunday off.

03:59.660 --> 04:02.020
You know,no moping,just some peace and quiet.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.400
Oh,my god.

04:03.590 --> 04:08.030
Ev...  You would'vemade a great best man.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.300

04:10.360 --> 04:13.230
I missed laundry daythis week.Cut me some slack.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.589
Hankmed,good morning.And how can we make youfeel better today?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.120
Tuberculosis tests?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.210
Uh,yes,of coursewe can deal with that.

04:23.290 --> 04:24.900
How many employees?

04:24.980 --> 04:27.340
Great,how does--how does 1:30 sound?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.390
Amazing.Okay.So I just need to get,

04:31.950 --> 04:33.320
Your address?

04:52.300 --> 04:54.580
hey,thank you for comingon such short notice.

04:54.660 --> 04:55.410
Of course.

04:55.490 --> 04:58.830
This new requirementby the health department must have every restaurantscrambling.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.410
You have no idea.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.400
So,uh,what happens next?

05:02.470 --> 05:05.310
We'll come backin a couple of days to check the injection sites.

05:05.390 --> 05:08.640
If anyone has tb,their forearmswill turn red and flare up.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.340
So,uh,this soupis very provocative.

05:12.460 --> 05:13.800
Do you embrace customer feedback?

05:13.920 --> 05:16.310
I'm sure sure does--from paying customers.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.550
You,I like.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.570
Can I talk to you in private?

05:20.650 --> 05:23.370
Yeah,sure.You're done.Thanks.

Hello,valentina.

I had a major crushon this italian bartender once.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.810
She was so hot.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.300
- Evan,I don't care right now.- All right.

06:34.870 --> 06:37.980
It's never happened before,and it hasn't happened since.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.480
I'm sure it was scary.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.780
Tell me,are you on any meds?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.830
Just birth control.

06:45.190 --> 06:47.620
I'm really glad you could comeon short notice,

06:47.700 --> 06:52.140
because I wanted to knowwhat happened to me,and I don't needanyone else knowing.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.880
Well,if you were worriedabout privacy,I could've met youat your home.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.850
This is my home.

06:57.930 --> 07:02.170
I'm here from dawn to2:00 A.M.,Seven days a week.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.890
So... What do you think?

07:06.010 --> 07:11.950
Okay,well,it could bea lot of things-- hypoglycemia,a seizure,bell's palsy.

07:11.990 --> 07:15.490
It could also bea complex migraine,a T.I.A.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.480
What's that?

07:16.560 --> 07:19.040
Transient ischemic attack,it's a mini-stroke.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.570
Very quick,no permanent damage.

07:22.730 --> 07:24.250
What else?

07:24.250 --> 07:26.220
Well,it could benothing at all.

07:26.260 --> 07:28.600
Oh,nothing?I'll take that.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.770
I'm sure you will.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.710
So listen,you should geta full physical and a neurological exam.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.970
I can help set it up.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.380
After labor day,when things slow down.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.970
Thank you so muchfor everything,doc.

07:43.050 --> 07:46.630
You have got a tableon the house anytime.

07:46.730 --> 07:51.430
Allison,you needfor things to slow down now.

07:51.620 --> 07:57.320
If you did have a T.I.A.And it remains untreated,you could be at riskfor a major stroke.

07:57.420 --> 08:01.710
It won't be quick,and there will bepermanent damage.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.560
I started the last restaurantI had with my husband.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.450
And one day...

08:16.440 --> 08:23.750
he just walked out,and he tookthe evening hostess with him and all of my recipeS.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.310
He took everything.

08:28.530 --> 08:33.010
And now,finally,I have something again,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.860
- so...- so protect it,allison.

08:35.980 --> 08:38.419
One day of routine tests,it's very simple.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.409
I'll leave this roomwhen you say yes.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.260
- Yes.- Thank you.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.530
You're lucky I like tough love.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.680
All right.So,um,I'll call you in a week.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.340
Great.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.410
Oh,this sauce.

08:59.490 --> 09:01.260

09:44.890 --> 09:48.110
The name is divya.

09:48.660 --> 09:52.360
That was cranky.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.870
Does the doctor's little helper need a power nap or something?

09:54.950 --> 09:56.580
- Doctor's little helper?- Yeah.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.780
While I may not have gone to medical school,

09:58.860 --> 10:04.640
I do hold a license as a certified physician assistant,which means I practice medicine.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.450
I can prescribe drugs,perform exams and procedures,

10:08.540 --> 10:12.190
interpret diagnostic tests,and assist in surgery.

10:12.470 --> 10:15.020
You definitely need... something.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.280
You know what I need?

10:16.360 --> 10:17.540
I need some boundaries.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.350
Boundaries?What's that supposed to mean?

10:19.430 --> 10:22.060
You set those tb tests at the most illogical time.

10:22.180 --> 10:25.110
- What?- While the restaurant was serving,evan.

10:25.290 --> 10:29.570
And then you ran around like a little yorkie yapping at everyone,

10:29.650 --> 10:34.490
begging for treats,practically humping my leg while I'm trying to administer the shots.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.260
Okay,so I'd also like some boundaries,

10:36.340 --> 10:39.010
starting with the kinds of animals you're allowed to compare me to.

10:39.050 --> 10:42.390
And you know what?Since you brought it up,how do you see my rolein hankmed?

10:42.430 --> 10:45.150
Why don't youjust stay at shadow pond and crunch the numbers?

10:45.180 --> 10:47.190
In the field,you are simply a distraction.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.810
Well,hankdoesn't seem to think so.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.770
He is probably numbto you by now.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.080
Well,let's ask him.He's right behind you.

10:53.230 --> 10:54.450
Hey,everything okay?

10:54.490 --> 10:56.340
Terrific.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.170
I,uh,set the follow-upfor sunday-- only day you're free.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.260
Actually,no,he's not free on sunday.

11:01.350 --> 11:02.810
He's taking a me day.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.070
Me meaning him,not me.

11:04.150 --> 11:06.510
Yeah,it's true.You mind handling this one solo?

11:06.620 --> 11:07.920
I'd be happy to.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.600
It's my job.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.680
Great. I'm gonna grabsome lunch.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.930
Seeing your swanof spaghettini made me hungry.

11:17.570 --> 11:18.800
- Are we done?
- Yep.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.060
How are you?

11:33.170 --> 11:36.220
Good.Is the,uh,hospital coffeereally that bad?

11:36.340 --> 11:38.930
Oh,officially speaking?No,it's delicious.

11:39.010 --> 11:41.900
- But off the record...- you could remove nail polishwith it.

11:41.980 --> 11:42.990
Exactly.

11:43.110 --> 11:46.140
I only bought this to,uh,try out my new cup holders.

11:46.220 --> 11:47.830
Wait,is this yours?

11:47.910 --> 11:48.920
- Where's--  yeah.

11:49.020 --> 11:54.490
Yeah,after 12 yearsand 217,000 miles,greta just stopped.

11:54.570 --> 11:58.460
The mechanic founda "do not resuscitate" card in the glove box.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.530
That's just too bad.

11:59.650 --> 12:02.520
I mean,now you can't cool downwith the top down.

12:02.590 --> 12:03.970
You want cool?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.470
The solar panels on my roofactually cool down the car.

12:07.550 --> 12:11.010
Eh,I like the windin my hair,but I'm old school.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.590
Shall I walk you to work?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.020
All right,old school.

12:15.390 --> 12:19.860
- So,uh... Did you getmy message?- I did.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.680
Nice outgoing message,by the way.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.940
Yeah,yours too,very hospital chic.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.300
That is so not a compliment.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.160
You're luckyif I go out with you now.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.890
Any,uh--any plans tonight?

12:30.010 --> 12:32.640
Late staff meeting.Tomorrow?

13:30.150 --> 13:32.430
Can you tell me where she is?

13:35.820 --> 13:39.160
We should try to hurry,and not just 'causeit's freezing in here.

13:39.230 --> 13:41.630
This is the only placewe could have privacy.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.860
And you know what?Try not to hurry.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.650
My shift starts at 11:00,I got to do my prep.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.250
Consider this your prep.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.530
You really arethe best boss ever.

13:52.550 --> 13:57.620
Chris...

14:06.300 --> 14:09.010
My arm--my arm's numb.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.300
Hey... what's wrong?

14:17.260 --> 14:18.760
What are we doing in here?

14:18.840 --> 14:21.430
Allison,we always do it in here.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.680
Hey,what's going on?

14:24.760 --> 14:26.930
Are you okay?

14:48.320 --> 14:51.330
Found yournetworking milieu yet?

14:56.010 --> 14:57.660
Not yet,no.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.490
Uh,have fun at sunday brunch,by the way.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.730
Aw,you're bitterabout hankapalooza.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.420
No.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.160
No,I'm not bitter,not at all,man.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.130
Hank-o-rama.Hankstock!

15:11.210 --> 15:13.920
Stop doing bad thingsto my name.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.240
Look,jill and I are justgetting together today because--

15:16.280 --> 15:18.400
it's your onlymutually available time slot for the next couple of weeks.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.540
I completely understand that.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.390
But honestly,though,brunch?

15:21.430 --> 15:22.450
What's wrong with brunch?

15:22.530 --> 15:25.140
It's brunch.You're wearing clothes,so it's not breakfast.

15:25.180 --> 15:29.230
You're not even that hungry yet,so it's not lunch,it's like--it's the mealthat won't commit.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.280
It's the--come to think of it,it's the perfect mealfor you and jill.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.810
So enjoy a french toast salador whatever.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.700
I'm sorry,was there something else?

15:40.170 --> 15:42.610
We have a good thinggoing here,evan.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.240
Just remember that.

15:53.060 --> 15:54.540
God..

16:07.690 --> 16:09.500
What the hell?

16:14.220 --> 16:16.040
Great,thank you.

16:16.950 --> 16:18.970
Ava litelli.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.800
Yes,I rememberthe nose ring.

16:23.050 --> 16:27.460
I had one for a few hourswhile I was at university-- too many margaritas.

16:27.730 --> 16:30.360
Okay,thank you.

16:30.910 --> 16:32.950
Valentina rossi.

16:33.250 --> 16:37.810
Oh,wait,miss litelli... can you please tell mewhere I might find valentina?

16:38.650 --> 16:40.850
I don't thinkshe's working today.

16:41.170 --> 16:44.410
Oh,really?I thought I saw you talkingwith her earlier.

16:44.490 --> 16:47.170
You must've confused herwith someone else.

16:47.290 --> 16:51.410
In fact,I know I sawthe two of you together.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.070
What I don't knowis why you're lying for her now.

16:55.150 --> 16:58.690
And what youapparently don't know is that defraudingthe health department--

16:58.770 --> 17:02.190
in any way--is a very big deal.

17:02.270 --> 17:05.220
I have to finish my prep.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.369
Tell me where valentina went.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.609
Tell me,or I'll callthe health department.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.240
Yes,mrs. Franklin?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.760
The farmers market--you should find her there.

17:24.849 --> 17:27.130
Thank you.

17:27.869 --> 17:30.670
I need to confirmmy nail appointment.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.190
What exactlyis happening here?

18:11.230 --> 18:16.260
Our reservationwas 45 minutes ago,which is how longthat table's been empty for.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.320
Phone call.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.290
This close,huh?

18:21.370 --> 18:23.770
How far back do youand allison go,exactly?

18:23.850 --> 18:26.250
A couple of days,but long days.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.090
- Take it- Okay.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.630
Hello?

18:32.140 --> 18:34.930
Uh,excuse me.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.970
This really isn't a good time.Can we talk later?

18:38.670 --> 18:41.010
I don't know exactly when.What do you...?

18:42.150 --> 18:43.890
No,I'm okay.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.340
I'm really good,actually.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.160
Yes,of course I remember.

18:48.240 --> 18:53.070
But honestly,nikki,I'm trying to forget,and maybe you should too.

18:53.820 --> 18:57.160
No,look,I can't do that--I got to go.I got to go.Bye.Bye.

18:59.910 --> 19:01.600
Everything okay?

19:01.800 --> 19:08.140
Okay,so that was my... ex-fiancee.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.870
Okay. When was the "ex" added?

19:12.540 --> 19:14.660
A few weeks ago.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.630
And when was the wedding?

19:19.180 --> 19:21.900
Some time around...right now.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.710
Now?

19:29.810 --> 19:31.660
Look,I was gonna tell youall about it,

19:31.700 --> 19:36.260
which I will do,over a drink,if we ever get a table.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.430
Oh,I'm sorry.Excuse me one sec.

19:39.900 --> 19:43.110
Hey,allison.I stopped byfor that table you offered me.

19:43.230 --> 19:46.180
I'm sorry,have we met?

19:46.570 --> 19:47.520
Yeah.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.630
I'm hank. Dr. Lawson.

19:52.410 --> 19:53.710
Um,I'm sorry.

19:53.870 --> 19:56.660
I don't recognize you.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.340
Do you recognize her?

20:08.650 --> 20:10.580
Call 911.I think she's had a stroke.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.960
So the stroke induced the amnesia.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.410
A ct scan will tell us ifit's hemorrhagic or thrombotic.

20:21.410 --> 20:22.570
Well,what's the difference in treatment?

20:22.570 --> 20:25.550
If it's hemorrhagic,it'll depend on how much brain damageshe's already suffered.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.310
-And if it's thrombotic?
-There won't beany brain damage.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.330
She can get thrombalitics,whichcan help break up the clot.

20:29.330 --> 20:32.020
But there's a catch,we'd onlyhave a three-hour window to administer these meds.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.250
But we don't knowwhen the stroke occurred.

20:33.250 --> 20:36.280
No.So evenin the best-case scenario,we're already runningout of time.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.860
Gently,gently.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.860
I'll seeif I can find her a bed.

20:42.860 --> 20:44.240
Dr. Dern,and you are?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.230
-My doctor.
-Yeah,hank lawson.

20:46.230 --> 20:47.200
Look at me,please.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.110
Who are you?What are you doing?

20:48.110 --> 20:50.180
It's okay,allison.You're safe.

20:50.180 --> 20:54.420
Allison moore,she presentedto me about 20 minutes ago with confusion towards self,place,and date.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.270
I believe she's a candidatefor stroke protocol.

20:56.270 --> 20:57.680
I'll callfor a neurology consult.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.730
No,I think she needsa ct scan first.

20:59.730 --> 21:00.630
What time was the stroke?

21:00.630 --> 21:03.280
I don't know,I asked everyone I could before the emt showed up.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.350
Radiology.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.640
-Okay--
-doctor.I'm sorry.You know the rules.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.410
Unless you're familyor have privileges here,this is as far as you go.

21:10.410 --> 21:12.230
Hank,hank,please don't leave me.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.720
I'll be right here,allison.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.690
Excuse me.Valentina!

21:22.690 --> 21:26.150
I need to talk to you.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.380
What?

21:41.880 --> 21:46.320
He bought a mermaid?

22:22.950 --> 22:26.190
Holy shark.

22:28.270 --> 22:29.790
I need to check your arm.

22:29.790 --> 22:30.980
*********

22:30.980 --> 22:33.130
Valentina,this is serious.

22:33.130 --> 22:34.570
It'll just take a moment,okay?

22:34.570 --> 22:37.230
******

22:37.230 --> 22:37.960
Oh,no.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.920
All right,does anyone speak italian?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.790
Valentina,wait!

22:48.160 --> 22:54.110
So there'syour 10-foot sand tiger shark,a voracious eaterand predator.

22:54.110 --> 22:55.490
How long was your journey?

22:55.490 --> 22:56.630
60 hours.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.200
She was in tonic immobility?

22:58.200 --> 23:01.760
Upside down-- natural state of paralysisthe entire time.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.970
She'll do well here.

23:04.970 --> 23:07.370
For your services,mr.Hogan.

23:07.370 --> 23:10.610
And... for your discretion.

23:10.610 --> 23:12.120
Cheers.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.470
Thank you.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.770
All right,mate.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.530
You satisfied with her?

23:22.530 --> 23:25.600
She's exactly what I need.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.130
I should let katie know.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.190
Hey,just got your message.

23:59.190 --> 24:02.480
Sorry to bother youon your me day,but we may have a situation.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.510
What kind of situation?

24:03.510 --> 24:06.600
One of the cooks had a ratherlarge reaction to the tb test.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.120
Did you get a sputum sample?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.720
I couldn'T.She ran away from me.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.690
Well,she could startan epidemic,divya.

24:11.690 --> 24:14.070
Don't worry.I have a plan.

24:14.070 --> 24:15.840
-I have to go.
-Hank,wait.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.240
One question.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.880
Do you know where evan is?

24:19.880 --> 24:22.950
No,no idea.I've been at hampton's heritage.Allison had a stroke.

24:22.950 --> 24:24.670
Oh,my god.Is she okay?

24:24.670 --> 24:28.230
I wish I knew.Uh,talk soon.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.750
Hey,you workwith allison,right?

24:30.750 --> 24:32.330
There's a rumorshe had a stroke.

24:32.330 --> 24:34.280
It's more than a rumor.Sorry,look,I don't have a lot of time.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.230
Allison may not havea lot of time.

24:36.230 --> 24:39.750
Do you have any informationthat can help her?

24:43.500 --> 24:46.010
Look,I'm only interestedin what's medically relevant,

24:46.010 --> 24:50.070
because the medicinethat can help her must be givenwithin a three-hour period.

24:50.070 --> 24:52.560
Do you know whenshe started acting unusual?

24:52.560 --> 24:54.450
She definitely wouldn't wantme talking about that.

24:54.450 --> 24:58.860
Yeah,she would,becauseshe could die if you don'T.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.720
We were in the walk-in.

25:02.720 --> 25:08.280
It's where we always,um... you know.

25:08.850 --> 25:10.460
Right afterward.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.140
It was weird.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.370
She was weird.

25:13.370 --> 25:15.320
Okay,when exactly was this?

25:15.320 --> 25:16.780
Sex can be a triggerfor a stroke.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.430
I need to knowwhat time the clock started.

25:18.430 --> 25:19.920
Right before my shiftat 11:00.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.110
Okay,thank you.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.560
Note to self--get a car,preferably one with doors.

25:38.570 --> 25:42.160
I've got a problem.Meet me at 23 foxtail court as soon as possible.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.860

Remember the womanfrom the restaurant?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.250
The one who speaks italian?

26:01.250 --> 26:03.170
Yes,valentina.She's totally hot.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.820
I need you to translate.

Okay,yeah,I'd be-- I'd be happyto provide my aiuto.

26:09.170 --> 26:11.270

26:22.220 --> 26:24.250
I'm not getting a disease.Are you kidding me?

26:24.250 --> 26:26.520
Especially one I didn't haveany fun catching.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.150
We'll talk through the dooror a window,okay?

27:15.230 --> 27:19.110
Uh,maybe something got lostin translation.

27:19.110 --> 27:22.080
The radiologistsaid the ct scan confirmed a thrombotic stroke.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.500
Well,we have until 2:00 P.M.To give her the meds,so...

27:24.500 --> 27:27.690

27:28.780 --> 27:30.310
Are you sure this is her room?

27:30.310 --> 27:32.560
Positive.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.150
Where's the patient?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.440
You don't know?

27:35.440 --> 27:37.690
She was here 20 minutes ago.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.900
Her street clothes are gone.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.860

How much time do we have?

27:44.660 --> 27:48.390

27:49.510 --> 27:51.520
Search again.Check the bathrooms.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.880
Well,look,if she does show up,call me.

27:55.700 --> 27:59.440
-She's not in the hospital.
-She's not at her restaurant.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.510
We'll go to her house.

28:29.830 --> 28:35.300
Uh...  ask her if this hurts and if she's noticed any bloodor drainage coming from the area.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.600
Okay...

28:36.600 --> 28:38.540
**********

28:38.540 --> 28:41.040
*****

28:41.040 --> 28:41.950
okay,what'd she say?

28:41.950 --> 28:44.680
********

28:44.680 --> 28:48.010
She's-- okay,now she's-- now she's just showing off.

28:48.010 --> 28:50.780
************

28:50.780 --> 28:53.830
*****

28:53.830 --> 28:56.130
******************

28:58.080 --> 29:01.280
Okay,now she's talking aboutthe things she loves the most.

29:02.010 --> 29:05.470
Like cooking her...kid?

29:05.470 --> 29:07.560
Oh,she loves cookingand her kid.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.280
She has a little boy.She's talking about him.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.560
She really needs her job.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.760
Okay,okay... ask her if her arm is tight.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.710
You know,if the skinwon't stretch.

29:18.710 --> 29:19.650
She's still talking.

29:19.650 --> 29:21.670
Divya-- divya,I can't work like this.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.990
Evan,she reacted to the test.I need samples.

29:23.990 --> 29:29.490
Valent-  Valentina-- she just keeps talkingabout italy.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.000
Of course,of course.

29:34.870 --> 29:38.180
It all makes sense now.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.770
Yeah,maybe to you.

29:44.810 --> 29:47.950
Allison!It's hank!

29:47.950 --> 29:49.810
You there?Allison?

29:49.810 --> 29:52.180
I'll check the back door.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.890
Don't bother.She's not here.She's never here. Come on.

29:55.890 --> 29:56.760
Wait,how do you know?

29:56.760 --> 29:57.990
Because she told me.

29:57.990 --> 29:58.960
Wait,what did she tell you?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.880
Allison's homeisn't her house.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.290
Her homeis where she really lives.

30:02.290 --> 30:05.070
-And where's that?
-Come on.

30:08.910 --> 30:11.090
Okay,so nowI'm really confused.

30:11.090 --> 30:12.610
You're--you're gonna give heran x-ray?

30:12.610 --> 30:14.310
A chest x-ray,yes.

30:14.310 --> 30:16.810
Tell her,and I'll explain whyto you later.

30:16.810 --> 30:19.130
You're gonna give hera chest x-ray on her arm?

30:19.130 --> 30:20.860
Like,how are you evengonna do that?

30:20.860 --> 30:22.250
She's gonna lean outthrough the window?

30:22.250 --> 30:23.910
Of course not.I'm going inside.

30:23.910 --> 30:25.130
You're gonna what?

30:25.130 --> 30:26.250
You're just gonna riskinfection?

30:26.250 --> 30:28.120
I have a hunchthe risk is low.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.420
I'll be back in five.

30:29.420 --> 30:32.220
You have "a hunch" you're notgonna get tuberculosis?

30:32.220 --> 30:33.280
Man,I should stayout of the field.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.890
Evan,a little help,please.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.900
*************

30:46.210 --> 30:48.180
*******

30:48.180 --> 30:50.810
I don't think I explainedthe chest x-ray thing very well.

30:50.810 --> 30:55.030
Tell her the scar on her armis from her bcg vaccine.

30:55.030 --> 30:56.370
What is that?

30:56.370 --> 31:01.480
It's a tb inoculation done outside the U.S.In places like italy.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.580
Okay,so when people come hereand they have the bcg vaccine

31:04.580 --> 31:11.170
and they get the tb test,the resultswill almost always be a false positive.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.970
Thus,her arm.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.590
That's what got lostin translation.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.610
Tell her.

31:21.400 --> 31:25.980
***********

31:27.510 --> 31:29.500
Mm,it's completely clear.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.750
She's gonna be fine.

31:30.750 --> 31:35.000
******

31:35.870 --> 31:39.610
Well,tell her everythingshe needs to know.

31:43.350 --> 31:45.950
*******

31:45.950 --> 31:51.210
Grazie! Grazie.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.340
Si.

31:53.340 --> 31:56.050
So I'm not done with you.

31:56.050 --> 31:59.110
About our deal...

31:59.110 --> 32:00.350
oh...now?

32:00.350 --> 32:02.630
Oh,yeah.

32:02.630 --> 32:06.680
Okay,uh...boris.

32:06.830 --> 32:11.040
Gosh,evan,he's very...private.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.610
Yeah,I know that.

32:12.610 --> 32:14.490
And?

32:14.490 --> 32:16.980
Well,that's all I've got.

32:16.980 --> 32:20.550
What do you meanthat's all you've got?

32:20.720 --> 32:30.180
You lying... manipulative... ponzi schemer.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.090
I thought you had detailsabout boris.

32:32.090 --> 32:35.810
And I thoughtyou knew italian.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.150
But her staffsaid she wasn't here.

32:43.150 --> 32:45.860
She will be--dawn till 2:00,seven days a week.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.340
And I think I know where.

32:47.340 --> 32:50.060
I bet she went backto where the stroke began.

33:01.190 --> 33:04.020
Excuse me,could youhelp clear this table,please?

33:04.020 --> 33:05.290
Thank you.

33:05.290 --> 33:08.520
Okay,I need tin foil,aluminum foil.Rip them,let's go.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.040
Big strips.Blankets,okay.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.410
I got your call.

33:11.410 --> 33:13.130
Uh,jill,divya.Divya,jill.

33:13.130 --> 33:15.650
Divya,I want youto take that bag.I want you to put itin the hot water.

33:15.650 --> 33:17.090
Can I borrow this,please?

33:17.090 --> 33:20.490
Her core temp must be below 89.6. Any luck with the hair dryer?

33:20.490 --> 33:22.730
-Got it.
-Great.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.710
Plug that into there.

33:24.710 --> 33:27.200
Okay,turn it on.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.770
Home-made bair hugger.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.240
Okay,let's start the ivs.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.630
Saline's ready.

33:32.630 --> 33:35.310
-Do you have a pulse?
-Weak,but steady.Her temperature's rising.

33:35.310 --> 33:38.090
Okay,let mesee the thrombalitics.

33:38.090 --> 33:39.000
Wait,what are you doing?

33:39.000 --> 33:39.950
Getting them prepped.

33:39.950 --> 33:41.270
You can'T.We're past the window.

33:41.270 --> 33:42.560
What,it's beenmore than three hours?

33:42.560 --> 33:45.750
Yes,but the coldslowed her metabolism and bought us some time.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.370
She could havea major brain bleed if you use a blood thinner now.

33:48.370 --> 33:50.200
Isn't the three-hour limitnonnegotiable?

33:50.200 --> 33:51.930
At a hospital.But we're not in a hospital.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.600
If we were,we'd be requiredto sit back and do nothing.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.010
But she needs this to save herlife,and I'm giving it to her.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.320
Should I have updated my will?

34:28.320 --> 34:33.650
Evan richard lawson,certified public accountant.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.630
You know we've met,right?

34:36.630 --> 34:40.260
Are you an intelligent man,mr.Lawson?

34:40.260 --> 34:42.570
Well,I--

34:47.929 --> 34:50.440
I shouldn't have trespassed.

34:50.440 --> 34:54.219
It was silly.I wasn't thinking about it.

34:54.219 --> 34:55.520
And...I'm really sorry.

34:55.520 --> 34:59.710
It's only trespassing if you violated my privacy.

34:59.710 --> 35:01.340
Was my privacy violated?

35:01.340 --> 35:04.050
It was.

35:06.420 --> 35:08.780
Are you certain of that?

35:08.780 --> 35:10.740
Yeah.

35:10.740 --> 35:15.810
-Because I saw your...
-yes?

35:15.810 --> 35:19.190
You know,the--the--

35:20.440 --> 35:23.550
what did you see?

35:23.550 --> 35:29.200
You know,the... big...

35:29.200 --> 35:37.090
It appearsthat evan R.Lawson,cfo,is quickly outshining evan R.Lawson,cpa.

35:43.190 --> 35:45.220
I didn't see anything.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.170
So my privacywasn't violated?

35:48.170 --> 35:51.540
No!Not at all.

35:53.020 --> 35:56.620
Then nor will yours be.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.270
Dieter.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.210
Going down.

36:08.350 --> 36:11.010
So I finally slowed downfor you.

36:11.010 --> 36:13.780
I'm glad you rememberwe talked about that.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.960
Now you have to do it.

36:17.430 --> 36:19.120
Valentina,per favore.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.150

Don't look that happy.I'm gonna be back soon.

36:29.930 --> 36:35.150
Your ristorante is safe with me.

36:37.330 --> 36:39.600

36:39.600 --> 36:42.300
Okay,guys.

36:46.610 --> 36:47.860
-Talk to you later.
-Good work,divya.

36:47.860 --> 36:51.130
-Nice meeting you.
-Take care.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.100
You took a big riskto save that woman.

36:54.100 --> 36:57.360
Maybe now we can geta decent table.

37:12.090 --> 37:12.830
To allison.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.140
To valentina.

37:14.140 --> 37:16.110
And to two more checksin the mail.

37:16.110 --> 37:18.840
-Cheers. Cheers.
-Salute. Cin cin.

37:20.670 --> 37:23.840
So,uh,we're gonna start with the calamari and the hot pickled peppers.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.280
No,we decidedon the prosciutto de parma.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.180
That's what you decided.

37:27.180 --> 37:28.610
Actually,it's what we both decided.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.120
But--not me.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.510
Hello.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.550
To thank you.

37:33.550 --> 37:39.350

37:46.150 --> 37:48.930
Buon appetito.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.290
She's pretty.

37:51.700 --> 37:54.060
Thank you very much.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.270
You're leaving?

37:56.270 --> 37:57.380
I have other plans.

37:57.380 --> 37:58.970
You made this reservation.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.830
Yeah,for you guys.

38:00.830 --> 38:04.680
Differences are always easierto settle over a good meal.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.980
Buon appetito.

38:05.980 --> 38:10.520
No,you--hank.You're kidding me.

38:18.950 --> 38:24.550
You know,divya... we did crackthat tb case wide open.

38:24.550 --> 38:25.440
We?

38:25.440 --> 38:27.890
Yeah,like a team.

38:27.890 --> 38:32.680
Here's an idea-- let's have dinner,but absolutely no conversation.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.660
Yeah,like we're married.

38:35.660 --> 38:38.650
Hank.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.750
Don't panic.I'm not here to work.I'm here to eat.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.210
You're lucky.I hear the food is great.

38:44.210 --> 38:48.640
I am lucky.I'm very lucky.

38:53.340 --> 38:54.680
Thank you.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.800
You got it.

39:07.450 --> 39:13.500
You know,back at the restaurant,after we found herin the freezer,

39:13.500 --> 39:15.780
it looked pretty grim therefor a few moments.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.760
I know.I'm gladallison's gonna be okay.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.480
Yeah,thanks to you.

39:23.650 --> 39:25.250
Well...  what was she thinking?

39:25.250 --> 39:27.450
I don't thinkshe was thinking about much.She had a stroke.

39:27.450 --> 39:30.770
No,I-I meant nikki.

39:31.310 --> 39:32.990
Yeah,I'm sorry.I shouldn't have said that.

39:32.990 --> 39:34.680
No,no,it's cool.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.900
I just-- I thought it was moreof a down-the-road conversation.

39:37.900 --> 39:38.760
You want to stall?

39:38.760 --> 39:39.860
No,I don't want to stall.

39:39.860 --> 39:44.380
I just want to be ableto carefully articulate my-- yeah,I want to stall.

39:44.380 --> 39:46.410
But look,now that it's out there,

39:46.410 --> 39:49.660
I should never have askedyou out on my wedding day--

39:49.660 --> 39:52.230
my ex-wedding day.

39:52.230 --> 39:55.150
It's okay.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.130
I know what it's liketo be living your plan "B."

39:58.130 --> 39:59.940
You do?

39:59.940 --> 40:03.420
I was engaged once too.

40:05.560 --> 40:09.130
So you broke yours off also?

40:09.130 --> 40:12.900
No,I-I went through with it.

40:12.900 --> 40:18.120
But,you know,it just didn't work out,so I started from scratch.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.470
Okay,I get it.You don't wantto talk about your ex.

40:20.470 --> 40:21.900
No,no,it's not that.It's just--

40:21.900 --> 40:23.810
no,it's--yeah.No,you want to stall.

40:23.810 --> 40:26.230
No,it's not that.It's just that...

40:26.230 --> 40:29.470
you and I--we juststarted seeing each other,

40:29.470 --> 40:36.890
and... well,he,um... it'S... it's just complicated.

40:36.890 --> 40:38.310
And,you know--yeah,I want to stall.

40:38.310 --> 40:42.160
Look,I get it.Relationships are all about timing.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.560
No,I completely agree.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.390
So where does that leave us?

40:49.070 --> 40:53.570
I guesswe just take things slow.

40:53.570 --> 40:55.190
I could do slow.

40:55.190 --> 41:00.100
Yeah,not rush into anything.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.670
Absolutely.

41:02.670 --> 41:04.450
We can stall.

41:04.450 --> 41:08.330
Stall.Good plan.
