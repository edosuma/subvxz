00:00.190 --> 00:01.539
Bay: <i> Previously on</i> Switched at Birth...

00:02.254 --> 00:03.303
No, you do this now.

00:03.338 --> 00:05.171
It's done. It's forever.

00:05.207 --> 00:06.939
I know that you're stuck in the middle.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.045
Of course.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.763
You gave Melody $50,000?

00:13.799 --> 00:14.814
For the deaf program.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.082
Daphne's tuition is past-due.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.984
I said that I'm taking care of it.

00:18.020 --> 00:20.854
There's nothing left for me to
liquidate. That pretty much taps me out.

00:20.889 --> 00:21.888
I'm pregnant.

00:22.908 --> 00:24.491
I knew there was a higher chance.

00:24.526 --> 00:26.459
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:26.495 --> 00:28.495
The baby has Down syndrome.

00:28.497 --> 00:29.562
I don't think we're ready for this.

00:29.598 --> 00:31.598
I know.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.366
My mom, she's still alive.

00:33.435 --> 00:34.834
Her name is Hope Paxton.

00:34.870 --> 00:37.570
<i>She's working at a car shop back
where we used to live in Atlanta.</i>

00:37.642 --> 00:40.242
I did what I had to do to protect my son,

00:40.295 --> 00:41.510
and I'd do it again in a second.

00:41.546 --> 00:43.312
<i>Regina: I wish it wasn't like this.</i>

00:45.383 --> 00:47.049
(Regina laughing)

00:47.101 --> 00:48.351
Nice move.

00:48.353 --> 00:49.885
Hmm. Which one?

00:51.923 --> 00:53.823
Leaving work in the
middle of the afternoon.

00:54.826 --> 00:57.893
Actually, you are the
best move I've ever made.

00:59.931 --> 01:02.698
Well, I can't argue with that.

01:04.635 --> 01:06.736
So are you ready for my next big idea?

01:06.738 --> 01:07.703
Bring it.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.474
I think we should move in together.

01:12.510 --> 01:14.276
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:14.312 --> 01:17.346
Look, for the first time in
years, I feel like I can breathe.

01:17.382 --> 01:20.082
And now that you know everything
there is to know about me,

01:20.118 --> 01:21.984
we can really become a family.

01:23.021 --> 01:24.036
(Exhales)

01:24.088 --> 01:26.038
That's really nice.

01:28.943 --> 01:30.826
You don't have to give
me an answer right now.

01:30.862 --> 01:31.827
Okay.

01:31.863 --> 01:33.896
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

01:33.931 --> 01:36.065
You got an answer yet?

01:36.100 --> 01:37.917
Give me a few days, hmm?

01:37.969 --> 01:40.553
Okay. You got it.

01:41.356 --> 01:42.726
Now, come on. Let's go back and make sure

01:42.727 --> 01:44.250
no one's burned our coffee house down.

01:45.877 --> 01:47.476
Come on.

01:52.650 --> 01:53.716
(Door opening and closing)

01:53.751 --> 01:57.386
Hey, just the man I was looking for.

01:57.438 --> 01:59.155
I found a space.

02:01.292 --> 02:03.042
- A space?
- Yes.

02:03.094 --> 02:04.260
For the musical.

02:04.295 --> 02:06.145
It's got 200 seats,

02:06.197 --> 02:10.066
the acoustics are great, and
the spring slot is available.

02:10.101 --> 02:11.000
Oh.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.302
Exciting, right?

02:16.007 --> 02:16.972
I can't.

02:18.059 --> 02:19.742
Um, I'm out.

02:20.745 --> 02:23.045
- Of what?
- The musical. Um...

02:24.048 --> 02:26.882
I gotta pass. I'm sorry. I...

02:26.918 --> 02:30.719
I just have other things going
on. I just can't right now.

02:30.755 --> 02:33.389
What's going on, honey?

02:37.278 --> 02:38.227
Nothing.

02:39.497 --> 02:40.429
Something.

02:42.567 --> 02:43.566
I can't.

02:47.338 --> 02:48.304
Yes, you can.

02:50.358 --> 02:52.174
Honey, no matter what it is.

03:00.118 --> 03:01.917
Can someone please say something?

03:03.955 --> 03:06.956
I told Toby that we were here for him,

03:06.991 --> 03:09.758
for him and Lily, whatever they need.

03:09.794 --> 03:11.777
Is there a you and Lily?

03:13.364 --> 03:15.331
(Exhales)

03:15.366 --> 03:16.398
I don't know.

03:16.434 --> 03:17.666
I don't know anything.

03:20.304 --> 03:22.271
I just don't understand how this happened.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.041
Did I not teach you to be responsible?

03:27.478 --> 03:28.944
I was responsible.

03:28.980 --> 03:32.014
Come on, John. Sometimes,
these things just happen.

03:32.049 --> 03:35.167
Well, all I'm seeing is him stumbling
from one catastrophe to the next.

03:35.203 --> 03:36.986
- Thanks.
- John!

03:37.989 --> 03:39.922
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

03:39.957 --> 03:41.790
Don't you think I'm trying
to do the right thing?

03:41.826 --> 03:43.926
And what is that, Toby?
What's the right thing?

03:44.912 --> 03:46.662
I don't know.

03:46.697 --> 03:48.481
I don't know what she's gonna do.

03:48.516 --> 03:49.798
I'm trying to support her.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.334
Do you have any idea

03:52.386 --> 03:55.604
how much it costs to take
care of a kid like that?

03:57.208 --> 03:59.108
(Shouts) Do you?

03:59.143 --> 04:01.277
Medical bills, therapists, tutors...

04:01.312 --> 04:04.930
do you have any idea
what all of this means?

04:04.982 --> 04:06.098
I am sure he knows.

04:06.150 --> 04:07.283
You're sure, Kathryn? Are you sure?

04:07.335 --> 04:08.984
Because I am not so sure.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.135
Let me tell you something.

04:10.188 --> 04:12.738
Kids like this may never be on their own,

04:12.790 --> 04:15.791
and that means you are responsible forever.

04:16.994 --> 04:18.827
Now, tell me, who's gonna pay for that?

04:19.829 --> 04:20.930
- (Silently)
- You?

04:20.964 --> 04:22.731
No. No, of course not. No.

04:22.767 --> 04:24.567
Oh, right, because you figure

04:24.602 --> 04:26.635
you can just go on screwing up,

04:26.671 --> 04:29.605
and I'll swoop in and clean up
your mess just like I always do.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.706
Dad with his wallet.

04:30.741 --> 04:31.774
- John!
- Dad.

04:31.809 --> 04:33.375
Not this time!

04:34.362 --> 04:35.578
This time, I won't.

04:43.504 --> 04:46.188
Why did I think it would go any different?

04:46.224 --> 04:47.990
(Door slamming)

04:47.992 --> 04:50.059
Toby, it is a lot to hear.

04:51.062 --> 04:51.994
I know that.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.997
I'll go talk to him.

04:55.032 --> 04:56.749
It'll be okay.

04:59.003 --> 05:00.035
I'm going home.

05:03.841 --> 05:04.807
(Door slamming)

05:06.110 --> 05:09.044

05:13.918 --> 05:17.219
I've got some news about Eric.

05:17.221 --> 05:18.220
Everything okay?

05:19.857 --> 05:22.191
He asked me to move in with him and Will.

05:22.226 --> 05:25.027
That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you.

05:25.062 --> 05:27.780
Hold on. I haven't said yes yet.

05:27.815 --> 05:29.064
Why not?

05:29.066 --> 05:32.067
I'm still considering the idea.

05:32.119 --> 05:33.902
And I wanted to know what you thought.

05:35.072 --> 05:36.989
I think I couldn't be happier

05:37.041 --> 05:39.041
you found such an incredible guy.

05:39.076 --> 05:41.744
- You really deserve it.
- Thank you.

05:41.796 --> 05:42.911
- (Phone vibrating)
- Uh... oh!

05:44.832 --> 05:46.248
- Hmm.
- The boyfriend?

05:46.250 --> 05:49.218
Um, your boyfriend actually.

05:49.253 --> 05:50.919
And he's a sore loser.

05:52.139 --> 05:55.758
Um, we've been in an epic
battle on Words with Friends,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.142
and I just won.

05:57.178 --> 05:58.978
I know a lot of "Q" words.

05:59.013 --> 06:01.146
I... I didn't know you were word friends.

06:01.182 --> 06:04.767
Oh, I should make dinner for
the two of you to celebrate.

06:04.819 --> 06:07.770
Well, hold on. I'm still
thinking things through,

06:07.772 --> 06:08.988
and there's nothing to celebrate yet.

06:09.023 --> 06:11.940
Okay, fine. I'll just make dinner.

06:11.942 --> 06:17.079
I'm gonna make all dishes that
start with "Q" just to torment him.

06:17.114 --> 06:18.947
(Laughing) Okay, sure.

06:18.949 --> 06:20.783
- All right. See you soon.
- Okay.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.922
He's a 21-year-old kid,
Kathryn! Come on! 21?

06:26.957 --> 06:28.123
I know.

06:28.125 --> 06:30.843
Raising a mentally-retarded child?

06:30.878 --> 06:32.094
John, walk in to the 21st century.

06:32.129 --> 06:33.929
You say Down syndrome.

06:33.964 --> 06:34.946
Whatever you wanna call it.

06:34.947 --> 06:37.306
It's a kid that's gonna
require extensive medical care,

06:37.318 --> 06:38.851
and that costs money.

06:38.886 --> 06:42.971
I cannot believe that the first thing
you think of is how much it's gonna cost.

06:42.973 --> 06:44.223
This is your grandchild.

06:44.331 --> 06:46.197
He didn't even bring up adoption.

06:46.233 --> 06:48.283
I am sure that there are
tons of people out there

06:48.335 --> 06:50.835
who are better-equipped
to raise a kid like that

06:50.871 --> 06:53.171
than our under-employed,
flip-flop-wearing son.

06:53.206 --> 06:56.091
You seriously want our
grandchild raised by strangers?

06:57.127 --> 07:00.245
May I remind you that, technically,
we are strangers to Bay,

07:00.280 --> 07:02.881
and that a stranger raised our daughter?

07:02.883 --> 07:04.182
Not by choice.

07:04.217 --> 07:07.135
Is this how you imagined spending
our third act, raising a baby?

07:07.187 --> 07:09.104
I don't know about you,
but I am too old for that.

07:09.139 --> 07:11.022
We would help him.

07:11.057 --> 07:12.974
Not raise the baby ourselves.

07:13.026 --> 07:15.226
Uh-huh. Well, you can count me out.

07:15.278 --> 07:17.145
- John.
- I'm going.

07:17.197 --> 07:19.147
Someone around here
has gotta earn a living.

07:20.233 --> 07:21.950
(Door opening and closing)

07:23.904 --> 07:27.205
- Bay: Have you heard?
- Yeah, I found out kind of by accident.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.908
J.K. freaked on him.

07:31.144 --> 07:35.079
Um, I'm sure he'll come around
by the time the baby arrives.

07:35.132 --> 07:36.965
(Scoffs)

07:37.000 --> 07:39.167
You're joking, right?

07:39.219 --> 07:44.055
You think that Toby should
become a parent right now?

07:44.090 --> 07:47.292
Lots of people become parents at his age.

07:47.327 --> 07:50.862
And it ruins their lives.

07:50.897 --> 07:52.964
My mom had me at that age.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.165
She actually had me.

07:54.201 --> 07:56.868
Okay, well, you know what I mean.

07:56.903 --> 07:58.937
Having a baby didn't ruin her life.

07:58.972 --> 08:00.688
(Scoffs)

08:00.724 --> 08:04.709
I'm just saying they have a lot
of options available to them.

08:04.744 --> 08:07.479
In fact, I can think of
two other ones off-hand.

08:08.498 --> 08:09.781
You mean one other option?

08:13.603 --> 08:15.520
Are you telling me that you're pr...

08:17.274 --> 08:19.607
Wow. Okay. Um...

08:21.294 --> 08:24.329
I guess we've never had this conversation.

08:25.398 --> 08:26.364
I guess not.

08:28.051 --> 08:29.067
I'm just surprised.

08:30.070 --> 08:31.269
Why?

08:31.271 --> 08:34.938
I don't eat meat, and I'm
against capital punishment.

08:34.975 --> 08:38.743
What about the whole Chip
Coto abstinence bill thing?

08:38.778 --> 08:41.044
I'm for contraception.

08:41.081 --> 08:45.617
You drove me to get the morning-after pill.

08:45.652 --> 08:47.919
The morning-after pill
is not an abortion pill.

08:47.954 --> 08:50.922
So you think that the
law should be overturned?

08:50.957 --> 08:55.343
No, I just think that we
should value all forms of life.

08:55.378 --> 08:57.428
Wait. I'm sorry. Is this from Regina,

08:57.430 --> 08:58.746
because I for sure thought
that she would be...

08:58.782 --> 09:01.366
She is. My mom and I disagree.

09:04.321 --> 09:05.603
So do my mom and I.

09:12.245 --> 09:14.012
We shouldn't get into this.

09:14.064 --> 09:15.046
You're right.

09:18.885 --> 09:19.801
Anyway...

09:21.221 --> 09:22.787
It's Toby and Lily's decision.

09:23.790 --> 09:24.789
Exactly.

09:24.824 --> 09:28.610
And I just want him to be fully-educated

09:28.662 --> 09:33.731
before he makes a decision that
he has to live with forever.

09:33.733 --> 09:36.834
Well, we can both agree on that.

09:40.574 --> 09:42.423
So, they're...

09:43.426 --> 09:44.375
gonna keep it?

09:45.695 --> 09:46.644
I don't know.

09:48.582 --> 09:51.115
I have my feelings about it,

09:51.151 --> 09:53.184
but Toby hasn't asked my opinion.

09:53.236 --> 09:55.303
Probably because he
knows how I feel about it.

09:55.338 --> 09:58.022
(Exhales) It's a lot to
deal with, no matter what.

09:59.059 --> 10:01.326
Oh, my god. John, he just... he lost it.

10:01.378 --> 10:02.660
I know it's a lot,

10:02.696 --> 10:05.129
but I'm actually afraid he's
gonna have another heart attack.

10:05.165 --> 10:06.080
He...

10:07.100 --> 10:10.034
Does seem to be under
a lot of stress lately.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.269
What do you mean?

10:11.304 --> 10:16.524
Well, I was gonna say something,
but I didn't wanna seem nosy.

10:16.576 --> 10:17.542
What?

10:17.577 --> 10:19.794
Well, Daphne's tuition was due,

10:19.829 --> 10:22.413
and he seemed a little off.

10:23.450 --> 10:24.816
And then his car, and...

10:25.819 --> 10:27.652
He seems sensitive about money lately.

10:27.687 --> 10:29.253
He hasn't said anything to me.

10:30.373 --> 10:32.490
You know, I am probably wrong.

10:32.509 --> 10:34.392
Just forget I even said anything.

Hi. You must be Travis.

11:44.139 --> 11:46.807
I'm Skye.

11:47.743 --> 11:48.842
So nice to meet you.

11:48.877 --> 11:51.061
Em has told me so much about you.

11:56.585 --> 11:59.519
I can't wait to hang out
with you guys this weekend.

12:17.616 --> 12:19.065
Toby: <i>I can't believe this is happening.</i>

12:19.966 --> 12:21.799
And I have no idea what she's gonna do,

12:21.834 --> 12:23.601
so I don't even know what to prepare for.

12:24.771 --> 12:26.771
Well, we can't control Lily,

12:26.806 --> 12:29.457
but we can help you make a
decision about what you want.

12:29.509 --> 12:34.495
I didn't think I was gonna be having
this conversation for 10 years.

12:34.530 --> 12:38.282
Look, before you make a
decision that's this big,

12:38.317 --> 12:39.533
you gotta do your research.

12:44.023 --> 12:45.156
That's really good advice.

12:46.292 --> 12:49.260
So, I'm gonna go make an
appointment to visit a school.

12:54.801 --> 12:56.684
- (Upbeat music playing)
- (Woman vocalizing)

13:07.002 --> 13:08.015
Mm-hmm.

13:13.085 --> 13:13.857
Yeah.

13:16.981 --> 13:19.584
Oh, tomorrow. Yeah.

13:26.932 --> 13:27.598
Mm-hmm.

13:47.000 --> 13:47.960
Skye: We'll be there.

13:51.390 --> 13:52.857
We're in. I did it.

13:54.093 --> 13:57.027
Okay, so a bunch of agents' assistants

13:57.063 --> 14:02.533
all go to this crazy, exclusive
happy hour once a month,

14:02.568 --> 14:06.654
and I just got us on the list for tomorrow.

14:06.706 --> 14:08.372
And get this.

14:08.407 --> 14:11.525
Raskind's assistant will be there. I know!

14:13.312 --> 14:14.035
Oh, um...

14:31.063 --> 14:34.064
Oh, the party is an
afternoon drinks type thing.

14:39.806 --> 14:40.971
Yay!

14:46.813 --> 14:51.715
Uh, may I offer anyone seconds
of quiche, quince, or quinoa?

14:52.919 --> 14:54.885
I really appreciate you not gloating.

14:54.921 --> 14:56.787
- Who me?
- Eric: Mm-hmm.

14:56.823 --> 14:59.423
So this is what dinners
together would be like, huh?

14:59.458 --> 15:00.624
Everybody ganging up on me.

15:00.660 --> 15:03.561
No, I'm on your side. Team Eric.

15:03.596 --> 15:05.379
Really? So, what if I told you

15:05.414 --> 15:08.399
I saw a killer apartment for you
and your mom to take a look at?

15:08.434 --> 15:10.201
I'd say text me the address.

15:10.253 --> 15:11.468
- Guys...
- We'll just pick the place.

15:11.504 --> 15:13.504
As long as you buy her a washer
and dryer, she'll be happy.

15:13.556 --> 15:15.356
(Laughing) Hey, you
got some time this week?

15:15.408 --> 15:17.208
- I got a bunch of places to look at.
- Absolutely.

15:17.243 --> 15:18.342
- Okay.
- Guys!

15:21.981 --> 15:24.281
We discussed me taking
time to think about it.

15:25.885 --> 15:28.152
Yeah, look, I'm sorry,
babe. I didn't mean...

15:28.187 --> 15:30.004
Mom, we were just kidding around.

15:31.424 --> 15:33.691
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. (Clears
throat) I just have a headache.

15:35.828 --> 15:39.597
Well, I should go anyway. I gotta
pick up Will from his playdate.

15:39.632 --> 15:40.631
Thanks for dinner, Daphne.

15:40.666 --> 15:41.582
Oh, any time.

15:44.353 --> 15:45.636
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:45.671 --> 15:46.737
Bye.

15:49.425 --> 15:50.541
(Door closing)

15:57.483 --> 15:59.984
Her name is Hope Paxton.

16:00.019 --> 16:02.152
Now, you know why I can't
just move in with him.

16:04.106 --> 16:06.874
Mom, you were an addict once,

16:06.926 --> 16:09.126
and you turned your life around.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.895
She could have too.

16:10.947 --> 16:12.997
I know. That's what I have to find out.

16:13.032 --> 16:14.765
How are you gonna do that?

16:15.768 --> 16:16.734
(Exhales)

16:17.870 --> 16:19.970
I booked a ticket to
Atlanta. I leave tomorrow.

16:20.006 --> 16:20.971
Seriously?

16:21.173 --> 16:22.873
Well, I found the auto
shop where she works.

16:22.909 --> 16:25.776
I figured I could tell everyone I
was visiting our cousins in Ohio.

16:28.681 --> 16:29.647
I'm coming with you.

16:29.699 --> 16:30.781
That's not a good idea.

16:30.783 --> 16:34.285
I'm not a kid anymore, and
you're not doing this alone.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.352
End of story.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.423
All right.

16:39.425 --> 16:41.225
I mean, what if she's changed,

16:41.277 --> 16:44.211
and now, she's just a mom mourning
her kid who was stolen from her?

16:44.247 --> 16:47.097
I mean, what do I do then? Do I
break up with him? Do I turn him in?

16:47.099 --> 16:48.933
Hey, one thing at a time.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.200
We have to find her first.

16:52.004 --> 16:52.937
Right.

16:56.075 --> 16:57.041
Right.

17:01.762 --> 17:03.745
(Kids laughing, chattering)

17:10.737 --> 17:13.538
We've got all kinds of
special needs kids here.

17:13.589 --> 17:18.393
Kids with spina bifida. Kids with
Williams syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.528
And, of course, our Down syndrome kids.

17:25.268 --> 17:27.569
Over here, we have our lifestyle table

17:27.604 --> 17:30.422
for kids to learn skills like
dressing and tooth-brushing,

17:30.474 --> 17:34.459
our fidget table for sensory kids who
need to always be holding something,

17:34.494 --> 17:38.346
and our quiet area for kids who
need some time to themselves.

17:39.316 --> 17:41.950
Um, what's with the socks?

17:42.002 --> 17:45.053
Oh, that's in honor of
world Down syndrome day.

17:45.088 --> 17:49.124
It's to bring awareness and acceptance
to people with Down syndrome.

17:49.176 --> 17:52.894
Sort of a nod to the idea
that different is okay.

17:52.929 --> 17:54.612
We don't have to be all the same.

17:55.632 --> 17:56.631
Hi.

17:59.736 --> 18:00.702
Hi.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.838
- What's your name?
- Sophia.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.374
Hi, Sophia. I'm Toby.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.709
Nice to meet you.

18:07.744 --> 18:09.411
It's nice to meet you too.

18:09.446 --> 18:10.712
I like your shirt.

18:12.399 --> 18:13.648
I like your dress.

18:15.318 --> 18:16.284
Come on.

18:22.509 --> 18:24.209
Are you guys prospective parents?

18:25.345 --> 18:29.330
Oh, um, not me. My brother, uh, might be.

18:31.918 --> 18:32.901
Welcome to the club.

18:32.936 --> 18:34.936
Thank you.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.956
Well, um, we'll see.

18:39.009 --> 18:40.725
I'm sure you're still in shock.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.580
Maybe sad too.

18:45.615 --> 18:46.581
Yeah.

18:47.901 --> 18:51.669
In the beginning, it can hurt a
little bit to... to see other kids.

18:53.857 --> 18:59.494
And there's definitely some tough
times, too. No doubt about that.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.262
But I can promise you

19:01.298 --> 19:04.566
it'll be the single most
enriching experience of your life.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.537
Thank you.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.055
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:27.090 --> 19:30.775
I, uh, just spoke to our new accountant.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.931
Okay. (Clears throat) I
don't know what he told you,

19:36.983 --> 19:38.700
but I have got this under control.

19:38.735 --> 19:39.868
Why didn't you talk to me?

19:39.920 --> 19:41.719
I didn't wanna worry you.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.507
(Exhales) At least I understand
why you've been behaving like this.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.542
But why didn't you let me in on this?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.345
I mean, the check I wrote
to Melody for the program...

19:50.380 --> 19:54.249
Kathryn, I am trying to find
a way to make this all work.

19:54.284 --> 19:56.317
And that musical that
you're so excited about,

19:56.353 --> 19:57.469
I don't want you to have to give that up.

19:57.581 --> 20:00.548
Honey, I am not some spoiled little girl

20:00.584 --> 20:03.484
that's gonna cry when you tell
me you're not gonna buy me a pony.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.337
I'm your partner.

20:06.389 --> 20:11.259
And I know that this is a lot bigger
than just passing up on the musical.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.293
Kathryn...

20:14.164 --> 20:15.897
I'm so sorry.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.872
Honey, this doesn't
reflect on you. You know it.

20:24.908 --> 20:26.741
That's why we hired a professional.

20:26.776 --> 20:29.777
I... I am sitting here,

20:29.813 --> 20:31.813
and I am trying to figure it all out.

20:31.865 --> 20:33.965
You know, what to sell. What to finance.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.602
And that's a longer conversation
we're gonna need to have.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.021
But right now, there's
something much more important.

20:40.056 --> 20:41.989
Toby is in a lot of pain.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.809
And I don't know what they're gonna do,

20:44.861 --> 20:47.795
but whatever it is, you
need to be supportive.

20:48.798 --> 20:51.599
Otherwise, it'll crack your
relationship with him forever.

20:55.405 --> 20:57.221
(Rock music playing)

21:05.398 --> 21:07.348
Hey, you got a torn water pump hose.

21:07.383 --> 21:08.282
Oh, no.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.252
Looks like somebody snipped this thing.

21:11.254 --> 21:12.353
Really?

21:14.073 --> 21:16.257
I should be able to get it patched up
and get you out of here pretty quick.

21:16.292 --> 21:19.160
Oh, good. Thanks.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.112
Uh, we just moved here.

21:21.164 --> 21:23.831
Last thing I need is more expenses.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.733
Especially on a teacher's
salary. You know what I mean?

21:25.735 --> 21:26.734
Mm-hmm.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.857
Do you have any suggestions on
good places to eat around here?

21:32.909 --> 21:34.642
- We're starving.
- (Laughs)

21:34.677 --> 21:36.544
You're asking the wrong
person. I don't go out much.

21:39.349 --> 21:40.515
Daphne: Is that your son?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.303
Yeah.

21:45.355 --> 21:47.438
He's adorable. How old is he?

21:47.490 --> 21:49.457
Well, that's an old
picture. He was five there.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.510
Uh, what school does he go to?

21:52.562 --> 21:55.229
I teach fifth grade.

21:55.265 --> 21:56.998
He doesn't stay with me anymore.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.433
He's with my son of a bitch
ex-husband, wherever he is.

22:00.954 --> 22:05.172
I don't have an exact match for this
hose, but I can jerry-rig something.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.859
It's a lot cheaper than ordering
a new one. That all right?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.777
Sure. Uh, great.

22:12.849 --> 22:16.751
Atlanta is a tough city to figure
out. Have you lived here long?

22:16.786 --> 22:18.753
I can't tell where I should
look for an apartment.

22:19.856 --> 22:21.022
You guys should probably wait in the lobby.

22:21.057 --> 22:22.823
I'll call you when the car is ready.

22:22.825 --> 22:24.959
I can't really have you
standing around here. Liability.

22:24.961 --> 22:27.562
Right. Sorry.

22:39.309 --> 22:40.541
Is there a soda machine around here?

22:40.577 --> 22:43.110
Caffeine is the only vice I have left.

22:45.181 --> 22:46.264
You a friend of Bill's?

22:46.299 --> 22:47.315
Sure am.

22:47.367 --> 22:52.086
Oh, I'm N.A. Three years
now, me and my husband.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.055
Are there any good meetings around here?

22:54.090 --> 22:56.857
Yeah, me and my husband go
to the one over at the Y.

22:56.893 --> 22:58.793
It's just a few blocks from here.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.094
Cool. Thanks.

23:07.871 --> 23:10.905
That Eric was totally wrong about her.

23:10.907 --> 23:12.807
She seems completely fine.

23:25.688 --> 23:27.255
How are we supposed to do that?

23:43.798 --> 23:47.666
Yeah. Remember, we can't look
like we're excited to be here.

23:47.701 --> 23:50.819
They can smell that, and
it's a major turn-off.

23:53.027 --> 23:56.658
Oh, hey, Shane. It's Skye. We
met at that Morricone festival.

23:57.711 --> 24:00.629
- Oh, yeah. Hey. Good to see you.
- You, too.

24:00.681 --> 24:03.382
This is my boyfriend, Emmett.

24:03.417 --> 24:04.783
Hey, what's up, Emmett?

24:04.835 --> 24:08.387
Oh, em, Shane is about to
shoot a short next month,

24:08.439 --> 24:13.459
and you need to tell him about that lens
flare effect that you used on the beach.

24:13.461 --> 24:15.327
Yeah, man, I'd love to hear about it.

24:17.231 --> 24:20.332
Oh, and this is Emmett's friend, Travis.

24:20.367 --> 24:21.333
He's visiting from...

24:35.900 --> 24:37.833
So, yeah, tell him about that opening shot.

24:42.156 --> 24:44.072
Thank you so much for showing us around.

24:44.124 --> 24:45.991
This has been really helpful.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.009
Of course.

24:47.061 --> 24:48.811
Now, in the past,

24:48.846 --> 24:51.864
people with Down syndrome
were institutionalized.

24:51.916 --> 24:55.517
But today, a lot go to mainstream schools.

24:55.569 --> 24:58.487
And many adults get jobs, get married.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.507
Most lead long, productive lives.

25:01.509 --> 25:03.308
That's amazing.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.743
Look, those kids were adorable,

25:04.778 --> 25:08.547
but in addition to being delayed mentally,

25:08.599 --> 25:10.449
a lot have serious health problems.

25:10.484 --> 25:13.285
I was reading that some
are born with heart defects,

25:13.287 --> 25:15.387
vision problems, and hearing
loss at the same time.

25:15.439 --> 25:19.374
So I just wanna be sure that we are
not getting the rose-colored view here.

25:19.410 --> 25:21.994
I mean, some are in diapers
their whole lives, right?

25:24.164 --> 25:28.066
It's true. There is a
wide spectrum of ability,

25:28.102 --> 25:30.669
as there is with any child.

25:31.705 --> 25:33.872
Look, I know it's hard
for you to understand.

25:33.924 --> 25:36.708
You aren't parents
already. You're so young.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.912
Of course, you want your child
to be happy and have an easy life.

25:39.947 --> 25:43.749
But being there for them
when things are perfect,

25:43.784 --> 25:45.784
anyone can do that.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.304
It is the hard times that make you closer.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.299
It'll be fine.

26:00.334 --> 26:02.167
- Hey.
- You showed up.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.435
Yep. Thanks.

26:05.039 --> 26:06.204
- I'm Regina.
- I'm Hope.

26:06.206 --> 26:07.956
Nice to meet you.

26:08.008 --> 26:09.041
How you doing? I'm Jared.

26:09.076 --> 26:10.192
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.327
Thank you.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.246
Excuse me, ladies. I gotta
make a phone call real quick.

26:14.248 --> 26:15.898
Okay. Bye.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.117
I'm speaking first tonight.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.720
Oh, good!

26:21.722 --> 26:23.055
Uh, go.

26:29.930 --> 26:32.698
Hello, everyone, I'm Hope. I'm an addict.

26:32.766 --> 26:34.566
All: Hi, Hope.

26:34.602 --> 26:37.486
I was a drunk and a user for 17 years.

26:37.521 --> 26:40.539
I still struggle to stay sober every day.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.276
And I paid the price for my addiction,

26:44.311 --> 26:46.111
a very high price.

26:47.548 --> 26:50.015
My son was taken from me.

26:52.202 --> 26:54.953
Every day, it's like a hole in my heart.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.241
And there was a time when...

27:01.045 --> 27:05.097
I used to wish that the pain
of missing him would go away,

27:05.132 --> 27:07.099
but I don't... I don't
wish for that anymore.

27:08.819 --> 27:11.536
'Cause that pain reminds
me to keep fighting.

27:13.974 --> 27:16.842
And to do whatever I have
to do to bring my son home.

27:24.585 --> 27:26.468
(Upbeat music playing)

28:57.227 --> 28:59.911
So, what are you thinking?

28:59.963 --> 29:01.713
I don't know yet, but...

29:02.833 --> 29:03.999
This was really helpful.

29:04.034 --> 29:04.933
Thanks for bringing me.

29:10.090 --> 29:11.039
What?

29:13.877 --> 29:15.911
Toby, I love that you're considering this,

29:15.946 --> 29:21.116
but make no mistake. You would
be in for a really hard life.

29:21.151 --> 29:23.001
Didn't you hear anything she just said?

29:23.036 --> 29:25.753
I did. I did hear it.

29:25.806 --> 29:27.655
About adversity being a good thing,

29:27.691 --> 29:30.558
and kids like this making
the world a richer place,

29:30.594 --> 29:32.560
and that may all be true,

29:32.596 --> 29:34.462
but there is no going back.

29:34.498 --> 29:36.464
And what if they're wrong
about how great it is?

29:36.500 --> 29:38.700
What if you get a really hard kid

29:38.752 --> 29:41.803
who's in the hospital all the time?

29:41.855 --> 29:44.572
The risk is so huge, and you're 21.

29:45.876 --> 29:49.511
This will define your entire
life right now, this decision.

29:49.513 --> 29:51.379
I know that. Don't you think I know that?

29:51.414 --> 29:54.199
You just have your whole life ahead
of you, and this could ruin it.

29:54.251 --> 29:57.218
So if Lily decides to keep the baby,

29:57.220 --> 29:58.303
you're not on board?

30:01.191 --> 30:02.123
I hope that she doesn't.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.393
I hope that she makes a different decision.

30:07.397 --> 30:09.898
Good to know.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.332
Thank you, family. Thanks a lot.

30:24.008 --> 30:25.674
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.

30:26.944 --> 30:28.727
You know the break is over,
right? Are you going back in?

30:28.779 --> 30:31.747
Uh, I'm just waiting
for a friend to come out.

30:32.717 --> 30:33.782
Your friend doesn't drive?

30:33.818 --> 30:36.352
No. Um, I mean...

30:36.387 --> 30:39.288
Uh, I should be in the meeting,

30:39.323 --> 30:41.390
but I haven't gotten
the nerve to go in yet.

30:41.392 --> 30:43.409
Ah, I get that.

30:43.444 --> 30:46.462
It's hard to quit cold turkey.
Not everybody can handle that.

30:46.497 --> 30:47.429
Yeah.

30:49.567 --> 30:52.451
Listen, I got a stash in the car.

30:54.172 --> 30:56.172
You ever need a little
something to take the edge off...

30:58.109 --> 31:01.043
Oh. Um, I am good.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.246
But thanks anyway.

31:06.884 --> 31:07.967
No problem.

31:19.564 --> 31:20.696
Thanks for coming.

31:27.805 --> 31:30.489
Can I get you anything? Water, tea?

31:30.541 --> 31:32.441
I mean, herbal tea. Fruit?

31:33.644 --> 31:35.544
I'm fine. Thank you.

31:44.422 --> 31:46.155
I went to a special needs school today.

31:48.092 --> 31:50.392
I talked to parents, met some kids.

31:50.428 --> 31:52.027
Yeah?

31:55.099 --> 31:56.966
I've been thinking about this a lot.

31:58.986 --> 32:00.119
Me, too.

32:00.171 --> 32:01.837
Okay.

32:03.741 --> 32:05.024
Here's the thing.

32:05.059 --> 32:07.793
I firmly believe in a
woman's right to her own body.

32:09.046 --> 32:11.564
- So do I.
- We're the ones who have to carry the baby,

32:11.616 --> 32:14.950
take care of it, turn our
entire lives upside down.

32:15.002 --> 32:16.852
And I feel strongly

32:16.887 --> 32:19.822
that children should be brought into
this world only when they're wanted

32:19.857 --> 32:22.458
and are able to be provided for.

32:22.493 --> 32:24.677
And that is a decision
that only a woman can make.

32:24.729 --> 32:27.596
I agree with you. I do.

32:30.368 --> 32:33.135
But in this case,

32:34.305 --> 32:35.304
for us...

32:42.046 --> 32:44.129
It's easy to say no.

32:46.117 --> 32:47.283
It's always easy to say no.

32:48.319 --> 32:49.885
But...

32:51.889 --> 32:56.025
There's something inside me
that's telling me to say yes.

32:58.663 --> 32:59.628
You wanna keep it?

33:00.731 --> 33:02.898
This kid is not gonna be a typical kid,

33:02.900 --> 33:05.551
but there's no such thing as a typical kid.

33:05.586 --> 33:06.719
Every kid has something.

33:06.771 --> 33:08.821
My sisters were switched at birth.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.572
Yeah, I was thinking the same.

33:13.511 --> 33:15.611
- I just wasn't sure if you were...
- I am.

33:18.783 --> 33:20.582
(Stammering) I do.

33:20.635 --> 33:21.583
Yes.

33:26.424 --> 33:27.506
Yes.

33:40.271 --> 33:42.805
I guess we should tell our families.

33:46.243 --> 33:47.159
Yeah.

33:52.950 --> 33:53.949
Hey.

33:54.952 --> 33:56.835
- How did it go?
- Great.

33:56.887 --> 33:59.488
All we found is a mom who
deserves to be with her kid.

34:00.891 --> 34:01.907
I'm so sorry, Mom.

34:04.845 --> 34:09.614
Oh, there's Hope. I wanna say goodbye
to her, thank her for inviting me.

34:10.751 --> 34:12.501
Wait.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.719
Is that her husband?

34:13.754 --> 34:15.270
Yeah. Why?

34:22.228 --> 34:25.114
But Hope just gave the most
amazing share in the meeting.

34:25.116 --> 34:26.965
Her husband seems really supportive.

34:29.270 --> 34:31.018
What if she doesn't know he's...

34:31.054 --> 34:32.020
Hey!

34:35.876 --> 34:38.060
- You told me you were an addict.
- Who are you?

34:38.094 --> 34:39.862
I'm nobody. I'm just Regina.

34:40.981 --> 34:43.766
Okay, you're not a cop.
You working for the cops?

34:43.801 --> 34:44.882
No, no, god, no.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.802
Well, then, why did you lie?

34:46.837 --> 34:51.956
I lied. I lied. I got scared when you
approached me. I didn't know what to say.

34:55.579 --> 34:56.895
You bad for business.

34:58.699 --> 35:00.716
Wherever you come from, go back there.

35:00.751 --> 35:03.819
I don't wanna see you
around here no more ever.

35:03.854 --> 35:05.521
Okay. Okay.

35:16.317 --> 35:17.316
Are you okay?

35:18.369 --> 35:20.169
Yeah.

35:20.204 --> 35:22.888
This was really stupid of me.
I shouldn't have taken you.

35:22.940 --> 35:25.991
No, you had to know, and now,
we do. I'm glad I was here.

35:26.043 --> 35:30.112
I hate that finding out someone
is liar and a drug dealer

35:30.148 --> 35:31.814
is good news for my love life.

35:31.849 --> 35:33.616
She's making her own choices.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.052
Will would be worse off with that woman.

35:39.557 --> 35:40.523
He would.

35:42.660 --> 35:43.959
But is it my place to decide?

35:45.596 --> 35:49.598
She's his mom. She probably
really does miss her kid.

35:51.452 --> 35:56.388
Maybe, but she's selling drugs to addicts.

35:56.440 --> 35:59.742
I can't think of anything
scummier than that.

35:59.777 --> 36:02.461
And Eric is an amazing father.

36:02.497 --> 36:03.546
Will's happy.

36:05.349 --> 36:06.398
He misses his mom.

36:08.286 --> 36:12.154
He misses his fantasy of a mom.

36:12.190 --> 36:14.473
Sometimes, kids don't
know what's best for them.

36:26.287 --> 36:27.286
Let's go home.

37:15.281 --> 37:16.905
(Phone vibrating)

37:53.024 --> 37:54.757
(Phone vibrating)

37:58.062 --> 37:59.028
Hey.

38:00.731 --> 38:01.647
You okay?

38:02.833 --> 38:04.883
I just got a text from Toby.

38:06.904 --> 38:08.604
They're keeping the baby.

38:09.707 --> 38:10.639
Wow.

38:13.711 --> 38:14.743
Wow.

38:16.847 --> 38:19.431
I know this might not be your choice,

38:19.467 --> 38:22.651
but you've gotta get on board fast.

38:23.721 --> 38:24.670
You know that, right?

38:39.253 --> 38:41.420
Hey, look who's back.

38:47.545 --> 38:50.079
Wow. I've missed you.

38:51.098 --> 38:53.048
How was Ohio? How are your cousins?

38:54.101 --> 38:56.068
- Good.
- Yeah? Okay.

38:56.120 --> 39:00.305
Hey, let's look at that apartment tomorrow.

39:03.094 --> 39:04.860
Are you sure?

39:04.895 --> 39:05.961
I'm sure.

39:08.032 --> 39:08.997
Okay.

39:19.877 --> 39:20.826
Hi.

39:20.878 --> 39:22.127
Hey, sweetheart.

39:22.179 --> 39:24.012
Hi.

39:24.048 --> 39:25.013
Hey.

39:26.067 --> 39:27.950
I know what you all think.

39:29.019 --> 39:32.888
I know Dad thinks that I'm a total screwup,

39:32.923 --> 39:36.058
and Bay thinks that I'm
making a huge mistake.

39:37.061 --> 39:39.762
And I don't blame you for thinking that.

39:39.764 --> 39:41.864
Toby, I overstepped.

39:43.317 --> 39:47.836
There are things going on that have
nothing to do with you. I'm sorry.

39:47.872 --> 39:49.705
No, you were... you were right. Um...

39:51.675 --> 39:52.674
(Exhales)

39:53.677 --> 39:56.478
I've made a lot of mistakes recently.

39:57.782 --> 40:01.617
(Shakily) And, um, I just don't
wanna think of this kid as a...

40:02.686 --> 40:03.752
Just another one.

40:06.424 --> 40:09.725
I know that I want to do this.

40:13.697 --> 40:15.614
But I'm scared.

40:15.666 --> 40:17.449
(Crying) I'm really scared.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.254
I can't do this without you guys.

40:22.306 --> 40:24.223
Toby.

40:24.258 --> 40:25.641
Toby, we got you.

40:25.676 --> 40:28.477
We are here for you, okay? Hey.

40:30.281 --> 40:31.447
We're in this together.

40:35.252 --> 40:36.251
All of us, honey.

40:38.289 --> 40:40.255
And... hey.
