Looking for his Gorki.

Oh, looks like somebody

Wife says he had a dodgy ticker.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.800
Apologies.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.440
It's natural causes.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.880
I'd stake my life on it.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.240
Geordie, soil.

Lidocaine.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.600
Might not wanna stake your life
on natural causes just yet.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.240

13:13.240 --> 13:17.040
Roy had a slipped disk.
It had bothered him for years.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.880
Was it bothering him last night?
Well, I wouldn't know.

13:19.880 --> 13:23.320
He comes here to practise
his routine after closing.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.800
I was in bed.

Thank you for your concern... sir.

You don't mind

13:43.760 --> 13:46.040
If you could be
as discreet as possible,

13:46.040 --> 13:48.400
I would really appreciate it.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.080
You seemed upset
by your husband's jokes.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.280
They're terrible jokes.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.520
About his terrible wife.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.640
It's an act. It's not real.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.160
A little close to the knuckle.

DOOR CLOSES

14:12.320 --> 14:16.040
Five whole days without a carcass,
is it too much to ask?

14:16.040 --> 14:17.560
We keep going.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.360
We keep giving our guests
a merry old time, for Roy.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.400
She seems pretty stoic.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.920
Howdy there, fellas.
Howdy, Sid.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.320
Is it a murder?
Is it the wife?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.760
Sylvia!

14:30.760 --> 14:33.240
In my Agatha Christies,
it's always the wife.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.160
Well, it looks like natural causes.
Aw, poor chap.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.720
Time to join our conga line!

14:38.720 --> 14:41.800
Conga line, Sylvia!
Ooh, I love a conga line!

14:43.000 --> 14:45.880
Sorry about Mr Reeves.
He'd want us to enjoy ourselves.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.080
MRS REEVES ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Let's make this a day to remember!

14:51.080 --> 14:53.880
The longest conga line yet!

14:58.320 --> 15:00.680
Did you hear that music blast
last night?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.840
It was ten past midnight, I checked.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.160
Come and join the conga line!

15:08.160 --> 15:10.320
Come on, you two, no excuses!

15:10.320 --> 15:13.320
Because nothing says "in memoriam"
like a conga line (!)

15:15.320 --> 15:16.720
Is that an Argus?
It is.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.840
Bit old, but...

15:18.840 --> 15:21.880
I use an Argus. I've actually
just had some photos accepted

15:21.880 --> 15:25.640
for an exhibition.
Really? We'd love to take a look.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.320
LOUDSPEAKER: Calling Mr Marlowe
to the conga line!

15:28.320 --> 15:30.560
Daniel Marlowe, hurry up!

15:30.560 --> 15:33.120
Duty calls.
Another time, perhaps.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.040
Oh, Gorki.
Have you read it?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.760
Half of it. It's quite...

15:44.880 --> 15:46.960
Impenetrable? Dull?

15:46.960 --> 15:49.640
So unbelievably dull.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.160
LOUDSPEAKER: Calling Leonard Finch
to the conga line.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.200
Leonard Finch to the conga line.
Hurry up!

15:56.200 --> 15:57.840
Leonard Finch.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.280
Bryan Stanford.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.760
So, he's listening to this.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.720
RECORD PLAYS

16:18.720 --> 16:20.600
He slumps forward...

16:20.600 --> 16:22.960
MUSIC PLAYS THROUGH SPEAKERS,
CRACKLES

16:25.000 --> 16:26.440
RECORD STOPS

16:26.440 --> 16:29.360
OK, but then how does he end up
in the ballroom?

16:42.360 --> 16:43.640
Geordie.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.320
Excuse me,
guests aren't allowed in here.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.760
Sorry, we... we didn't realise.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.720
Ah, would you look at that?

17:02.720 --> 17:04.240
Mm-hm, fancy (!)

17:05.840 --> 17:09.600
This safe,
where does Mr Reeves keep the key?

17:09.600 --> 17:11.840
You shouldn't be in here.
He's a detective.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.440
He's just doing his job.
And I'm doing mine.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.400
Perhaps you'd like
to answer his question.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.240
Perhaps you'd like to obey the sign.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.120
Ah. Mm-hm.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.880
Enjoy rifling through
a dead man's belongings.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.880
Does she ever stop smiling?

17:37.560 --> 17:39.680
Sorry, you were probably
just being polite,

17:39.680 --> 17:41.840
saying you'd see my work.
Not at all.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.080
Beautiful light.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.760
Not that I'm an aficionado.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.560
Firenze!
Have you been?

17:51.560 --> 17:53.560
No.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.880
Me neither.
I've never been anywhere.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.720
Thank you.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.160
I went to Morocco once.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.960
It was transcendent.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.400
Hard to find transcendence
in this place.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.040
I can imagine.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.360
There's hours' worth
of Cinefilm here.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.720
Oh, Margie gets about a bit.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.160
Not just the Northerners
lowering the tone, then.

18:33.160 --> 18:37.600
She's no ordinary holidaymaker.
She was working the camp.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.720
Roy sets his male guests up
with Margie, takes these...

18:43.720 --> 18:46.240
Then what, he blackmails them?

18:48.040 --> 18:51.280
Not exactly the souvenir snap
you'd want your wife to see, is it?

18:56.640 --> 18:58.480
Well, would you look at that?

18:58.480 --> 19:02.320
Well, that is certainly one way
to meet the light of your life.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.040
INSTRUCTOR: Bodies square, please.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.920
Right.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.440
May I?

19:10.440 --> 19:12.640
All right. Got my eye on you.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.360
Keep your hands north of the border.
Sid, please!

19:15.360 --> 19:17.400
SID CHUCKLES

19:23.560 --> 19:25.240
So, how long you been coming here?

19:26.280 --> 19:30.200
I used to work here, so...
Let me guess. You're a dancer.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.880
Dancer, singer.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.600
Entertainment was something
back then.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.080
Local paper used to say
I was destined for the West End.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.680
BOTH CHUCKLE

19:43.840 --> 19:46.360
Is this where you and Sid met?

19:46.360 --> 19:49.400
Place must hold happy memories.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.040
I think you should concentrate
on your footwork, Mr Davenport.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.360
Margie, we've seen the photographs.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.080
The ones Mr Reeves took.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.040
Excuse me.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.720
Margie?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.520
What did you say to her?

20:22.440 --> 20:24.080
What is it, my love?

20:24.080 --> 20:26.920
Come here.
Stop fretting, Sid, please.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.520
I demand to know
what you said to her.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.640
Demand? Don't be so dramatic.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.720
They know. About me.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.880
What sodding business is it
of yours?

20:40.360 --> 20:43.440
I thought you were on your holidays?
So did I, Sid.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.520
I saved her from that bastard.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.800
What matters is Margie's with me now
and she's happy.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.720
You got nothing to be ashamed of,
my love.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.160
Do you have to make
such a song and dance, Sid?

20:59.440 --> 21:01.800
You must've despised him.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.360
Us, and anyone who met him.

21:04.360 --> 21:07.960
So, why come back?
To rub the bastard's nose in it.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.960
He tried to ruin me.

21:09.960 --> 21:13.560
I got the girl.
I got the happy ever after.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.320
Good riddance to him, I say.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.720
Do you ever feel different
from other people?

21:25.720 --> 21:28.000
I think the more appropriate
question might be,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.360
do I ever feel remotely the same?

21:33.160 --> 21:36.320
You know, I... I look around here
and I see all these people smiling

21:36.320 --> 21:38.120
and enjoying themselves.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.280
All this inane bloody nonsense.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.960
They're just having fun.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.920
It is terribly inane,
though, isn't it?

21:53.280 --> 21:57.360
Being different
isn't so terribly bad.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.520
Better than being
something you're not.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.040
You'll go there one day.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.280
Sell your photographs
outside the Duomo.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.600
Make an absolute fortune.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.600
No.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.240
Sorry.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.160
No, sorry. I'm sorry.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.120
Bringing your wife back to the place
she turned tricks.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.720
To show off to your blackmailer.
Who says romance is dead?

22:46.920 --> 22:50.080
Who turned tricks?
Who's a blackmailer?

22:51.240 --> 22:53.200
No-one.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.680
I've set up the projector
in the main office, Inspector.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.360
Thank you.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.680
It's just a bit of film
I've got to watch, Cathy.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.360
Natural causes, you said.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.880
As natural as they come.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.760
And Detective Wicks
will be here shortly.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.120
Mm-hm.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.400
Promise me there is not
a murderer on the loose.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.280
What about the kids?!

23:13.280 --> 23:15.280
Wouldn't fancy his chances
against our lot.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.880
We don't know if it's murder.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.520
Not for sure.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.120
SHE SIGHS
Five days, you said.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.200
Do you know what's worse
than enforced fun?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.120
Someone that sulks their way
through it.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.840
Don't be angry.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.520
Why would I be angry?

23:41.520 --> 23:45.000
I was convivial with Bryan,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.600
he got the wrong impression,

23:47.600 --> 23:49.600
and...
Sir?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.400
And...?

23:53.400 --> 23:56.160
WHISPERS: He tried to kiss me.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.800
Bryan? Bryan, Bryan?!

23:58.800 --> 24:00.600
Shhh!

24:00.600 --> 24:03.800
Take it as a compliment.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.040
You're a handsome chap.
He's a handsome chap.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.280
# I can't
No matter how hard I try

24:14.280 --> 24:16.760
# So why don't you join me
And face your fears?

24:16.760 --> 24:19.760
# Stay still, honey
And I'll check your arrears

24:19.760 --> 24:21.600
# Pretty woman
There's no turning back

24:21.600 --> 24:23.920
# You've got to feel it baby
Like a train on a track... #

24:23.920 --> 24:25.120
Overdose.

24:25.120 --> 24:29.040
There's enough lidocaine to kill
that bloody donkey out there.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.560
I still think there's a chance
it could be natural causes.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.240
When was the last time
you had a murder case?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.880
'36, I believe.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.040
Where were you?

24:41.840 --> 24:43.080
School.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.960
I'll look this over for you,
how about that, hm?

24:46.960 --> 24:50.800
I doubt it'll make much difference,
but if you must.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.520
# I need a rhythm
With a stomping beat

24:52.520 --> 24:54.760
# It's ruling my body
From my head to my feet

24:54.760 --> 24:57.280
# I need a small dose
Just to keep me sane

24:57.280 --> 24:59.800
# While the rock 'n' roll music
Flows to my brain

24:59.800 --> 25:03.920
# I can't live without it now
Don't you doubt it, baby

25:03.920 --> 25:07.880
# Well, you may think I'm crazy
But it's my desire

25:07.880 --> 25:09.880
# This sound
Is just what gets me high

25:09.880 --> 25:13.000
# You can tell me to quit
But I'll have to admit

25:13.000 --> 25:15.920
# I can't
No matter how hard I try

25:15.920 --> 25:18.720
# So why don't you join me
And face your fears... #

25:18.720 --> 25:21.800
Mrs Reeves.
Evening, Miss Grant.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.440
Lovely dress.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.240
Were you aware
of your husband's dealings?

25:25.240 --> 25:26.640
We having a merry old time?

25:26.640 --> 25:29.080
Did you know he was
blackmailing the guests?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.760
Of course I bloody did.
But you didn't stop him?

25:31.760 --> 25:33.880
This place was my father's.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.480
Then I married,
and it belonged to Roy.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.200
He ruined it.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.840
That's the way it goes, isn't it?

25:40.840 --> 25:45.880
So, yes, I knew what he was doing.
And, no, I didn't stop him.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.760
Does that answer your question?

25:51.840 --> 25:55.360
Lidocaine.
Injected?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.440
Swelling in the throat.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.920
So he ingested it.
With his supper, maybe?

26:01.920 --> 26:04.440
Starting to wish
I hadn't had that hot pot.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.680
He was fine on stage.

26:06.680 --> 26:08.800
It must be someone who knew him.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.840
Excuse me, would you like to dance?
Not now, sorry.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.120
Someone who knew he took lidocaine.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.520
What?

26:23.760 --> 26:25.680
You only live once.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.200
I think I was a little rude.

26:35.200 --> 26:38.520
A little?
Inordinately rude.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.360
Extremely, supremely...

26:40.360 --> 26:43.920
Extraordinarily?
Extraordinarily rude.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.960
I'd love to dance with you.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.120
You coming or not?

27:16.480 --> 27:18.680
Now who's smiling?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.920
THEY CHUCKLE

27:41.200 --> 27:45.040
So, tell me.
Pamela. My real name's Pamela.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.360
Pamela's nice. Pamela's...
Middle-aged with too many kids.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.200
Ha! And a husband she hates.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.680
Pamela Smith doesn't get
top billing at the Palladium.

27:53.680 --> 27:57.160
Besides, everyone here's pretending
to be someone they're not.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.160
I bet even you are.

27:59.160 --> 28:03.520
Sadly, I am deeply uncomplicated.
Uh-uh. No.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.280
This face is hiding
all sorts of secrets.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.440
Go on, then, try me.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.600
You've got a love child.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.760
Not that I know of.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.960
Doomed affair
with a beautiful widow?

28:14.960 --> 28:16.200
Ah, if only.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.680
There must be something.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.280
I am my work. My work is me.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.160
That's as scandalous as it gets.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.440
THEY LAUGH

28:49.400 --> 28:52.240
Do you ever feel like you work
because there's something missing?

28:52.240 --> 28:55.640
That got serious suddenly.
We can do serious, can't we?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.680
I love what I do.
I love making people happy.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.240
Oh, I love my job, too. I just...

29:04.480 --> 29:06.920
Sometimes, I feel like
there must be something else.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.800
Like what?

29:09.960 --> 29:11.400
I don't know.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.320
Yes, you do.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.240
You know how this goes, right?

29:21.240 --> 29:24.120
We have a few nice nights,
you go back to your life,

29:24.120 --> 29:27.360
I go back to mine,
and we never see each other again.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.760
Mmm, it's a terrible idea (!)

29:29.760 --> 29:33.200
Terrible.
Truly, truly awful.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.200
Er... I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to stop you there.

30:15.320 --> 30:20.040
He told me he'd destroy this.
He used you, like he used Margie.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.960
Not like Margie. I'm not cheap.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.640
You don't like
what Roy was making you do.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.280
Him dying certainly put a stop
to that.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.560
You think I killed him?

30:32.560 --> 30:35.440
Did you?
100 times in my head.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.080
But no.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.120
Did you sleep with them?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.680
HE SCOFFS

30:44.680 --> 30:46.920
Is that all this was to you?

30:46.920 --> 30:49.000
Just a way to blackmail me?

30:58.920 --> 31:01.680
Oh, this is the most uncomfortable
bed I've ever slept in.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.440
It's cheap and it's gaudy,

31:03.440 --> 31:05.920
and I'd quite like Mrs C
to boil these sheets.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.920
Doesn't seem so bad.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.120
KNOCK AT DOOR, OPENS
Just a minute!

31:12.680 --> 31:14.720
Might I talk with you?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.760
Bryan.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.880
I never had Sunny down
as a younger version of Margie.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.480
Are you upset?

31:38.480 --> 31:40.760
No.
You liar.

31:42.640 --> 31:46.520
You're right about one thing.
You do not have a type.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.040
From a nun to a prostitute.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.440
Geordie.
It's almost biblical.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.560
It's Roy.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.080
Well, if he's in it,
then who took it?

32:03.760 --> 32:05.600
APPLAUSE

32:05.600 --> 32:09.160
Thank you, contestant five.
And the scores are?

32:09.160 --> 32:13.240
Go on, Margie, get up there.
I don't want to, Sid.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.840
And our final pair of pins!

32:22.840 --> 32:24.240
Go on, Sylvia.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.400
Contestant number six is housekeeper
to Reverend Davenport

32:27.400 --> 32:29.520
and his curate Mr Finch.

32:29.520 --> 32:33.760
What did God say after creating man?
"I can do better."

32:33.760 --> 32:35.960
And these legs are living proof.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.560
Bloody hell.
Higher! Higher!

32:39.560 --> 32:41.600
Lower! Lower!

32:41.600 --> 32:43.360
Thank you, contestant number six.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.760
And the scores are?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.520
Well done, Sylvia.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.520
And the winner is
contestant number 6!

32:50.520 --> 32:52.040
Oh!

32:52.040 --> 32:53.360
APPLAUSE

32:56.360 --> 32:59.320
This might be the happiest day
of my life.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.880
Our wedding apart, of course.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.000
You know they give it
to the old girls out of sympathy.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.560
Know that from experience, Margie?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.720
Mrs Chapman.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.920
Excellent.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.800
A word, if you don't mind.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.040
Mr Reeves would set up the men
with Sunny.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.040
I'd film them.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.640
In flagrante?

33:30.640 --> 33:33.560
No, Sunny would never go that far.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.520
She'd dance with them.
A kiss, maybe.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.520
What other footage do you have?

33:40.520 --> 33:43.560
You were filming
the night Mr Reeves died.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.440
Er... just his comedy routine.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.880
"Comedy" in inverted commas.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.640
Can I take this?

33:57.640 --> 33:59.240
Absolutely.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.040
You're a clergyman?
That's right.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.280
It's a rather delicate matter.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.600
Anything you say
will be in confidence.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.880
Your curate.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.120
I saw him with a man.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.240
They were in bed together.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.800
That can't be the case.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.000
Are you doubting what I saw?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.680
I'm doubting your reading
of the situation.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.560
What other way is there to read it?

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
I'll speak to him.
I should report it.

34:37.560 --> 34:38.800
I'll speak to him.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.480
Please, just...
just leave it with me.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.720
Action has to be taken,
Mr Davenport.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.600
He has to be dealt with.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.400
INAUDIBLE

35:25.920 --> 35:28.120
Bugger. Nothing.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.640
Let's watch it again.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.440
No, no, no, you don't.

35:34.440 --> 35:38.480
You're gonna have dinner with me,
then we're going to dance,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.760
before you walk me out
under the stars

35:40.760 --> 35:43.000
to tell me that you love me.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.600
Understood?

35:44.600 --> 35:46.920
That sounds pretty comprehensive.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.480
He keeps staring.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.640
Have a drink, stop worrying.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.080
I'm so scared.
Go on, you'll be great.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.200
Roy promised he'd make her a star.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.680
What she had to do
wasn't her choice.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.800
Roy wasn't there
when she made a play for me.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.960
Who said she was making a play?

36:32.120 --> 36:35.120
Did it ever cross your mind that
it was as simple as she liked you?

36:49.760 --> 36:51.800
Not now,
I've got butterflies enough.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.200
I'm sorry. You can understand
why I thought what I thought.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.920
That I was cheap?

36:56.920 --> 36:59.520
That your intentions towards me
were... Cheap.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.080
I'm not Margie.
I didn't say you were.

37:03.080 --> 37:05.240
I didn't sleep with them.

37:05.240 --> 37:07.640
I'm not hitching my wagon
to the first miserable old sod

37:07.640 --> 37:09.640
who can get me out of here.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.280
I liked you.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.000
Liked, past tense?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.800
SONG ENDS,
APPLAUSE

37:18.800 --> 37:21.280
The Merries House Band!

37:23.600 --> 37:29.040
Now, please, give a very warm
welcome to tonight's act,

37:29.040 --> 37:31.520
Miss Pamela Smith.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.160
We'll see.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.880
Thank you. Thank you.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.120
I've been doing some decorating
recently.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.720
D'you know how many men it takes
to wallpaper a bedroom?

37:49.720 --> 37:52.160
Well, depends on
how thinly you slice them.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.280
LAUGHTER

38:01.520 --> 38:04.120
A friend of mine once said
that marriage is...

38:04.120 --> 38:06.760
The stout. What?
..a three-ring circus.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.800
The lidocaine was in the stout.
Engagement ring,

38:08.800 --> 38:11.040
wedding ring, suffering.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.120
LAUGHTER

38:17.400 --> 38:19.800
Right, don't take your eyes
off that glass.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.000
Oh, bugger.
No, no, no. No.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.200
Look how much stout's
in his glass now.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.080
Maybe he got a top up.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.640
Or someone gave him that glass.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.880
I sometimes think wives
are like ventriloquists.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.400
They sit there nodding

38:40.400 --> 38:42.160
whilst the dummy
does all the talking.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.000
LAUGHTER

38:44.000 --> 38:47.560
You know what I mean, ladies,
"Yak, yak, yak."

38:47.560 --> 38:49.880
Ah, my grandmother had it right.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.400
She buried three husbands. Three!

38:52.400 --> 38:54.080
Two of them were only napping.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.920
My granny was onto something,
she really was.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.520
She said the quickest way
to a man's heart

38:59.520 --> 39:01.280
was through his chest.
LAUGHTER

39:01.280 --> 39:02.760
She wasn't wrong.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.480
You put the lidocaine
in your own drink

39:04.480 --> 39:06.080
and you gave it to Roy.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.720
I don't follow you.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.560
Outside.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.120
I have three pets, which is
pretty much like having a husband.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.560
A dog who growls all morning,
a parrot who swears all day,

39:14.560 --> 39:17.400
and a cat who comes home
late at night!

39:17.400 --> 39:19.840
If your husband
brings you flowers, ladies,

39:19.840 --> 39:22.640
and says it's for no reason,
there's a reason.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.800
There is most definitely a reason.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.760
HE REMEMBERS: 'I'm not Margie.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.080
'I'm not hitching my wagon
to the first miserable old sod

39:30.080 --> 39:32.960
'who can get me out of here.'

39:32.960 --> 39:35.240
'For goodness' sake, Sid,
do you have to make a show?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.280
'Everyone's staring!'

39:50.400 --> 39:52.920
Roy set out to ruin you, Sid.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.360
You put enough lidocaine
in that drink to kill him.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.240
That's right, isn't it?
No.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.000
No, it isn't right.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.720
It's pretty insensitive to bring
your wife here for your anniversary.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.880
A place where everyone knew
about her past.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.080
Perhaps that was
the final humiliation.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.000
You put the lidocaine in Sid's pint.

40:24.360 --> 40:27.920
And then Roy accidentally took
the pint intended for your husband.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.800
When Sid fell, you must've thought
it was all going to plan.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.440
But he was drunk, not poisoned.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.840
Sid!

40:41.840 --> 40:44.440
I don't understand.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.480
You took Sid back to your chalet.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.240
But he wasn't dying.
SNORING

40:49.240 --> 40:50.440
So you panicked.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.640
And then, for some reason,
you went out again.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.160
I still had the vial on me.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.760
Had to get rid of it.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.040
Margie, my love,
what are you saying?

41:02.800 --> 41:05.040
We know Roy was in his office
because of the music.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.280
BURST OF MUSIC

41:06.280 --> 41:09.400
And we know he made it outside
because of the mud on his shoes.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.640
COUGHS

41:10.640 --> 41:11.960
GASPS

41:17.160 --> 41:19.800
You knew Roy practised his routine
after hours.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.040
So you dragged him
into the ballroom.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.880
When I saw him, I knew.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.720
Knew what, Margie?

41:33.320 --> 41:35.360
That I'd killed the wrong man.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.240
You don't mean that.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.800
I don't understand. I don't.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.680
You brought me here to score points.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.360
How do you think that makes me feel?

41:47.360 --> 41:50.240
Roy was the one who humiliated you.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.280
You treat me like
some kind of prize.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.920
I feel worthless, Sid.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.000
You were nothing but a whore
when I met you.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.080
And you still make me feel like one.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.480
I saved you from the bastard.
That's not enough.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.840
I gave you everything.
Not love, Sid.

42:08.840 --> 42:11.480
You never gave me love.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.440
Even on holiday, we can't be us.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.280
Bryan would be a damn fool
to take it any further.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.640
It's more than that.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.120
We can never be ourselves.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.000
I long to hold hands.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.880
Imagine if we could hold hands
every day.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.240
It would become very dull,
very quickly.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.400
Come here.

43:13.880 --> 43:17.440
Right now, straight to the car.
Stop running, Ivy!

43:20.560 --> 43:23.880
Knew that Margie had a glint
in her eye. Oh, that's definitive.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.280
I was right, though.
It was the wife.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.720
You thought it was Roy's wife!
You can't just pick any wife.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.360
These are yours.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.240
Thank you.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.760
I've spoken to Mr Finch.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.840
And?

43:45.840 --> 43:48.920
I'll be taking up the matter
on our return.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.040
I felt it was my duty.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.800
More than that,
I felt it was a moral obligation.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.040
I hope you understand.

43:57.040 --> 44:00.080
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me handle it from here.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.960
Of course.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.320
What did he want?

44:08.320 --> 44:10.760
Photographs.
That all?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.560
What else would it be?

44:13.560 --> 44:15.560
Now, I don't know about you,

44:15.560 --> 44:18.040
but I am really looking forward
to getting home.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.520
Thing about this place,
everyone always leaves.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.440
You could leave, too.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.480
I'm going to. End of the season.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.160
You're wrong, by the way.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.280
I seem to be making a habit of that.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.640
Maybe you work because you love it,

44:36.640 --> 44:39.480
not because there's
something missing.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.480
Shame.

44:45.480 --> 44:48.200
I think I could've fallen in love
with you.

44:54.920 --> 44:58.600
MRS REEVES: Welcome to Merries,
where there's never a dull day,

44:58.600 --> 45:00.920
and the sun always shines.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.720
Forget work,

45:02.720 --> 45:04.640
leave your worries far behind

45:04.640 --> 45:09.840
and get ready to make friends
and memories you'll never forget.

45:09.840 --> 45:14.520
For those guests who are leaving us,
we wish you bon voyage.

45:14.520 --> 45:18.120
But don't despair, it's not forever.

45:18.120 --> 45:23.360
Though you may be far away,
no distance can keep us apart.

45:23.360 --> 45:27.080
We'll hold you safe in our hearts.

45:27.080 --> 45:31.760
And in time, we'll meet again.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.800
