00:24.825 --> 00:26.725
Mom, you'll hardly miss me
at Thanksgiving.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.795
Dad will be busy at the store
and I'm swamped.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.864
I do take time off.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.899
I'm coming home for Christmas.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.567
Yes, I have a life outside
of work, mom.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.937
I actually went on a date
this weekend.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.239
Nobody special,

00:40.341 --> 00:42.241
I haven't found my Sleepless
in Seattle yet

00:42.343 --> 00:44.743
but I'm still looking.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.346
Yes, when I'm ready to introduce
someone you will know, OK?

00:47.448 --> 00:48.047
I'm at work, mom.

00:48.149 --> 00:48.680
I gotta go.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.582
I gotta go. Bye.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.956
OK. Not so fast.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.725
You didn't call me yesterday.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.960
It is way too early
to be interrogated.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.128
No it's not.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.830
If I tell you will you let
me go to work?

01:04.864 --> 01:05.865
Dish.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.633
It wasn't exactly
a love connection.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.234
So?

01:09.336 --> 01:12.271
I don't like boats
and we went sailing.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.051
OK, I didn't know that
you don't like boats.

01:14.075 --> 01:18.277
I didn't know that I don't like
boats but it was a lot of boats.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.046
Like sailing and stories
and pictures and trophies.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.681
OK, that is too bad.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.284
I just don't think I could
ever compete with his boat.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.386
OK, alright, look.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.719
Forget Boat Guy,

01:27.822 --> 01:29.299
we just gotta get you back
in the saddle pronto.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.890
Get you a few more swings at
bat before the clock runs out.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.759
Take it easy on the metaphors.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.305
It's a bit of a problem,
I'll work on it.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.795
Addison, it's OK.

01:36.897 --> 01:37.963
Really.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.364
Is it?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.733
Have you been conspiring
with my mother?

01:42.770 --> 01:43.770
Not saying anything.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.605
<i>Holly, can I have a word?</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:49.641
You know, once a year I get
a report on employee's

01:49.743 --> 01:51.210
unused vacation time.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.480
Did you know that you have 41
days of unused vacation time?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.415
I must really love working here.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.818
Holly, if you don't use your
vacation time you'll lose it.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.398
Look, I get it. You wanna
be the best.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.321
You are the best.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.322
I got you.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.501
But you don't need
another bonus,

02:04.525 --> 02:05.757
you need a vacation.

02:05.826 --> 02:06.725
So take one.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.726
Starting tomorrow.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.894
Wait, what?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.473
Hand things off to Addison
and your team,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.731
come back in January refreshed.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.501
And Holly, say "thank you".

02:15.603 --> 02:17.436
Thank you?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.023
<i>Welcome to Montell's.</i>

02:38.125 --> 02:39.591
<i>It's Holly Montell.</i>

02:39.693 --> 02:41.026
<i>Welcome home!</i>

02:42.897 --> 02:43.795
<i>Hi honey!</i>

02:43.898 --> 02:45.297
<i>Hi dad!</i>

02:54.241 --> 02:56.275
Excuse me, I have a complaint.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.210
It is way too early
for Christmas carols.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.778
It isn't even Thanksgiving yet.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.513
Come here, girl!

03:03.551 --> 03:04.750
Are you here to spell me?

03:04.818 --> 03:07.052
Because I have a plane to catch
to the Bahamas.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.353
You wish.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.499
Did you seriously just fly here?

03:09.523 --> 03:10.523
You look amazing.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.524
You are too kind.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.493
My mom doesn't even know
that I'm here yet,

03:14.595 --> 03:17.162
but I had to come by and say hi
to my bestie.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.631
So how was your boat date?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.600
I can't talk about it.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.768
But how about you?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.770
How's Jay?
How's the kiddo?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.972
The kiddo is this big.

03:27.074 --> 03:27.639
No.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.408
<i>My dear daughter!</i>

03:29.510 --> 03:30.987
Well, she's been here
three and a half minutes

03:31.011 --> 03:33.111
and she's already running
the store.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.080
Nope, she's here
on personal business.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.182
Exactly.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.116
Just don't stay too long.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.529
We'll never hear the end of it
from your mother.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.587
I promise, dad.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.788
So?

03:42.890 --> 03:43.934
Looks good out there, right?

03:43.958 --> 03:45.224
It does.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.705
Why are you hanging
them out here?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.740
They'll get all beat up
by the weather.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.642
Because I like 'em, Uncle Ralph.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.945
Plus it's Christmas time.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.181
Nick, shouldn't those be
at the counter

04:09.283 --> 04:10.983
so we can sell them?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.899
When you're finished that
come and help me in the field.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.389
OK.

04:19.994 --> 04:22.794
So Jenny was thinking about
putting the Doug firs up front.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.096
Yeah?

04:24.198 --> 04:26.632
Well, maybe she's right, Nick.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.100
Really?

04:28.202 --> 04:30.736
Whatever happened to "if
it ain't broke don't fix it"?

04:30.838 --> 04:35.274
Well, you know,
this is my last year.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.520
Are you gonna threaten me on
the day before Thanksgiving,

04:37.544 --> 04:38.610
Uncle Ralph?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.123
What, you thought I was
joking when I said

04:40.147 --> 04:43.348
I'd turn the business over
to you when you turned 35?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.183
I wasn't joking.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.286
I know.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.430
Do we have to talk
about that now?

04:47.454 --> 04:48.887
Why not now?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.867
You know, your father
and I started this business

04:50.891 --> 04:53.625
42 years ago when I was 26.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.727
I know.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.631
So when are you gonna be ready?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.444
You should take the rest of
the afternoon off.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.468
Come on, Uncle Ralph...

05:02.536 --> 05:03.813
In fact, take all the time
you need,

05:03.837 --> 05:06.271
and don't come back
until you're really ready.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.172
There's a lot to do.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.514
We gotta hang the lights and...

05:08.542 --> 05:10.275
Look. Just go home, Nick.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.377
I ran this business
for 36 years without you,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.113
I think I can manage
a few lights.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.090
Nick, where are you going?

05:25.192 --> 05:26.058
Home.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.392
Why?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.061
Babe, what's going on?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.330
Ask Uncle Ralph.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.403
<i>Holly, I'm glad
you made it home.</i>

05:38.505 --> 05:40.138
<i>Me too, Grammy.</i>

05:40.240 --> 05:41.940
OK, that needs to be turned.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.443
Ivy, darling, can you ask Kyle
to come to the kitchen?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.345
I do need a man to do that job.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.114
Yes. Sure thing.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.982
And perhaps next year
it'll be your young man

05:51.085 --> 05:53.085
that I summon to turkey duty.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.019
Really, mom?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.554
I just got here.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.589
Elaine, she didn't go to Wharton

05:57.691 --> 06:01.126
so she could chase a bunch
of kids around the house.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.896
She could have done that without
spending two hundred grand.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.765
You always take her side.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.668
I always take the right side.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.118
Chef Rob has arrived.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.953
You scared me but
you're a lifesaver.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.055
Yeah, you're welcome.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.522
For both.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.625
Day?

06:33.727 --> 06:34.926
Don't ask.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.828
Too much trees, not enough dirt?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.363
Ha ha.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.872
Couldn't have been worse
than my day.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.133
Yeah? Spill it.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.267
Four.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.336
Count 'em, four Santas quit.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.237
What?

06:45.339 --> 06:46.138
Yeah.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.272
And two elves.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.374
How does that happen?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.474
Let me tell you.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.810
Hip replacement,
lower back pain,

06:51.912 --> 06:53.945
the flu... that's actually
good that he quit,

06:54.014 --> 06:55.947
that would have been bad...
and get this.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.916
Hearing aid not
working properly.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.919
He didn't think he was gonna
be able to hear the kids.

07:00.988 --> 07:01.988
That would be a problem.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.321
That is a problem.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.991
Maybe that's what I get
for only hiring old Santas.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.426
What about the elves?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.772
I couldn't get a hold of one,

07:08.796 --> 07:10.073
the other one got in a fight
with her boyfriend

07:10.097 --> 07:11.963
so she was too upset to work.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.800
That's what you get for only
hiring young elves.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.673
What am I gonna do?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.643
I can play Santa for you.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.156
Don't you have a ton of trees
to sell?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.480
Like, literally a ton of trees?

07:28.582 --> 07:31.216
No, 'cause Uncle Ralph
sent me home today.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.662
What do you mean,
he sent you home?

07:32.686 --> 07:33.952
You're almost 35.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.064
Did you get grounded, too?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.288
What're you talking about?

07:36.390 --> 07:37.734
Can we watch TV later,
or is that off the table?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.536
He wants me to take over
the business and insisted

07:39.560 --> 07:41.626
that I make a decision
on it today.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.228
OK.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.696
Isn't that your plan?

07:44.798 --> 07:45.864
It is.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.365
It was. I...

07:47.468 --> 07:50.235
So... I'm sorry,
what's the problem?

07:50.337 --> 07:51.770
I'm confused here.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.040
Do I have to, you know, decide
the day before Thanksgiving

07:55.142 --> 07:57.576
what I'm gonna do with
the next 30 years of my life?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.544
I mean, well I've committed
to staffing Santas

07:59.613 --> 08:01.046
for the foreseeable future.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.282
Hey, if I can do Santas
you can do trees.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.117
Well, I'm not doing trees
right now,

08:06.220 --> 08:08.854
which is why I'm gonna do
Santa for you.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.121
No can do.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.401
They send the young Santas home.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.625
Not if they're good with kids.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.292
Do you even know any kids?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.561
I mean, I was great with the 4H
volunteers in the lot.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.663
You remember?

08:17.698 --> 08:18.830
Right.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.999
Wait, Rob, you don't think
I can do this?

08:21.101 --> 08:24.703
Well, I didn't say that, per Se.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.972
It was more implied than said
but it's just...

08:27.074 --> 08:28.618
where are you going, man?
Pizza's getting cold.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.420
<i>What, you don't think I can be
jolly for a couple hours</i>

08:30.444 --> 08:31.444
<i>with 20 kids?</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:34.044
Yeah, try 50 kids.
Eight hours a day

08:34.147 --> 08:36.181
on the busiest shopping day
of the year.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.650
So yeah. I definitely
don't think you can.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.184
Well, ho, ho, ho!

08:40.287 --> 08:41.986
Merry Christmas!

08:42.089 --> 08:44.155
Merry Christmas, Robbie!

08:44.224 --> 08:45.290
Merry Christmas for who?

08:46.159 --> 08:48.226
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

08:48.328 --> 08:49.728
Merry Christmas!

08:49.830 --> 08:52.464
Where are you gonna find Santas
this committed?

08:52.566 --> 08:54.032
Ho, ho, ho!

08:54.134 --> 08:55.700
Don't make me beg, Rob.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.269
OK, OK, I give in.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.470
Yes!

08:58.572 --> 09:00.972
Just take that off.
You're my newest Santa.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.642
Just burn this outfit, I
never wanna see it again,

09:03.744 --> 09:06.278
and keep the boots
'cause you can use those.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.380
I'll do the rest.

09:08.482 --> 09:09.314
Alright.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.649
Cheers.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.651
I can't look at you.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.098
<i>Dad, I can't believe you
were at the store</i>

09:15.122 --> 09:16.454
<i>until 2:00 am last night.</i>

09:16.557 --> 09:18.590
Well, the important thing
is that we are ready

09:18.692 --> 09:19.692
for Black Friday.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.660
Totally ready?

09:21.762 --> 09:25.196
No missing shipments,
no backorder dramas?

09:25.299 --> 09:28.400
No, not this year,
it's smooth like butter.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.035
I gotta see this.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.203
You're supposed to be
on vacation,

09:32.306 --> 09:34.205
not working at the store.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.308
Who said anything about working?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.376
Speaking of being ready,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.445
will you be attending
your birthday ball

09:40.547 --> 09:41.713
with anyone we know?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.282
Mom, it's hardly
my birthday ball.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.586
It is the Christmas Eve ball
and it's your birthday so...

09:47.688 --> 09:48.987
No pressure.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.422
It is your 35th.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.790
OK, dad. Make her stop.

09:51.892 --> 09:52.892
Well, I wanna know, too.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.459
Who are you bringing?

09:54.561 --> 09:56.761
You see?

09:56.863 --> 09:59.397
First of all, we are not
celebrating my birthday

09:59.499 --> 10:01.766
with the entire population
of Noblesville.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.870
And second, I've been home
for, like, two seconds.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.174
When I know who I'm bringing,
if I'm bringing anyone,

10:09.276 --> 10:10.508
I'll tell you.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.079
It's hardly the entire
population of Noblesville.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.647
OK, who wants pie?

10:15.749 --> 10:16.147
<i>I do.</i>

10:16.249 --> 10:16.982
<i>Yes.</i>

10:17.084 --> 10:18.149
<i>Great.</i>

10:19.753 --> 10:20.753
But that...

10:21.922 --> 10:23.688
I'll take that, Grammy.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.130
Anything I can do?

10:31.198 --> 10:32.964
Just don't bother.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.766
Honey, she's just being
your mother.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.668
I know.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.837
Listen, I really don't want
you working

10:38.939 --> 10:40.805
at the store this season.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.118
Take some well-deserved
time off.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.274
Do something you love.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.076
I love the store.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.545
I'm just gonna swing by
and say hi to some folks.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.614
It'll only be an hour.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.182
One hour.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.052
Please tell mom to knock it off.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.788
Otherwise I won't be her kitchen
slave on Christmas.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.123
I mean it.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.160
Da-da-da!

11:02.262 --> 11:05.930
<i>Grammy, you outdid yourself
this year.</i>

11:15.542 --> 11:16.542
Arturo!

11:16.610 --> 11:17.610
I've missed you.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.943
Holly, hey!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.779
What're you doing here?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.859
It looks like you've got things
under control here.

11:22.883 --> 11:23.615
Yeah.

11:23.717 --> 11:24.516
So give me the dirt.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.517
How's business?

11:25.619 --> 11:27.118
Alive, kicking.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.921
Alright, well how about a bike
ride while I'm home?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.835
In this cold? I don't think so,
Seattle girl.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.192
Alright, softie.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.827
Bye, hipster.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.000
Hey.

11:42.102 --> 11:42.734
Hi!

11:42.836 --> 11:43.735
You're back so soon.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.569
Lucky me.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.837
Shh.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.440
It's only for one hour
because I'm on vacation.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.375
Elle.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.343
Your Santa's here.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.812
Hi.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.580
Hi.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.317
What happened to Larry?

11:59.419 --> 12:02.520
Larry retired last year.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.256
This Santa's kinda young.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.292
He is young.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.860
Excuse me. Hi.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.163
I know I'm young for Santa
but I'm good with kids.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.398
It doesn't matter.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.510
I'm gonna have to call
a staffing company.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.694
I'm so sorry, there's just...

12:15.736 --> 12:17.168
there are so many kids
out there.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.136
It's a lot.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.471
That's great.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.539
And the staffing company

12:21.641 --> 12:23.742
is just running really short
on old Santas.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.444
They know you wanted one
but they sent me

12:25.479 --> 12:28.913
because they knew
I'd do a good job.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.749
Come on, give me a shot.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.052
If you really think I suck I'll
help you find an older Santa.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.887
We got a lot of kids waiting,

12:35.989 --> 12:39.424
just wanna know if we should
tell them Santa's sick or...

12:39.526 --> 12:40.325
Nope.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.659
He's coming.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.827
Let's get that beard on.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.462
OK.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.599
Let's hope this works.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.200
Yeah.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.640
Sorry.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.447
OK, here goes nothing.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.581
Ho, ho, ho!

13:03.683 --> 13:05.150
Merry Christmas, kids!

13:05.252 --> 13:06.384
Merry Christmas!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.386
Come. Come sit next
to Santa.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.587
Hi.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.336
Do you have something important
to tell me?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.025
Crisis averted.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.060
That's an awesome gift.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.273
We'll definitely get
that for ya.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.396
High five.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.564
Merry Christmas.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.832
Bye, Emily.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.066
OK, Merry Christmas.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.002
Come sit next to Santa.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.570
Come on!

13:25.672 --> 13:29.207
<i>Come all ye faithful</i>

13:29.309 --> 13:30.141
No.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.777
<i>Joyful and triumphant.</i>

13:32.879 --> 13:34.646
Nice try but it's not
gonna happen.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.181
Fine.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.351
Cara, are you ill?

13:40.453 --> 13:41.486
Yeah.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.588
Come, sit.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.122
I thought you looked pale.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.293
OK, you know what's not good
for business on Black Friday?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.395
A sick elf and a bunch of kids.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.467
Why don't you send her home
and get someone else?

13:56.570 --> 13:57.735
Not possible.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.315
The staffing company is already
down two elves,

13:59.339 --> 14:01.039
that's why Cara's an elf.

14:01.107 --> 14:04.242
I'm sure it's just
a 24-hour thing.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.178
Well, who else can do it?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.181
I mean, I'm sure you have tons
of temp help today.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.351
I looked all over the store
but I...

14:13.453 --> 14:17.322
Yeah, we're short staffed and
this costume is really small.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.929
What?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.931
No.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.767
No, no, no, no, no.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.170
I wouldn't even be suggesting it
if there was anyone else

14:32.272 --> 14:33.638
who could do it.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.741
I will help Santa but
in my own clothes, OK?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.644
Holls, I hate to break it
to you but that three-year-old

14:39.746 --> 14:41.646
who's been waiting 30 minutes
to see Santa

14:41.748 --> 14:44.249
does not want to see you
as Santa's helper.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.584
She wants to believe.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.487
Are you seriously saying if
I don't dress like an elf

14:49.589 --> 14:52.824
I'm going to ruin Christmas
for a three-year-old?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.478
Remind me to have you fired
after Christmas.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.448
This is great.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.919
A baby-faced Santa
and an elf with an MBA.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.253
Elle, I need...

15:22.322 --> 15:24.489
Don't say a word.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.963
Can we get this over with?

15:32.065 --> 15:33.476
I'm sure I don't need
to say anything

15:33.500 --> 15:35.266
about your elf attitude.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.001
Shut it.

15:44.978 --> 15:45.843
OK.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.078
I'll be an elf.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.047
I'll even have a great
elf attitude, I will.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.015
But please don't make me
wear these shoes.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.850
They are killing me.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.497
And then you're gonna have
to amputate my feet

15:54.521 --> 15:56.988
which defeats the whole purpose
of this elf-speriment.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.790
I have an idea.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.372
Like another person
wearing this suit?

16:00.427 --> 16:01.859
Nope.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.695
See? Look, he's doing great.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.029
Here's a chair just for you.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.765
OK, so what're you thinking
you want this year?

16:07.867 --> 16:08.733
He's doing better than great.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.001
He doesn't even need me.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.838
All he needs is a Montell
to show him the ropes.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.139
No.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.452
Please don't tell him that
my dad owns the store.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.809
Why not?

16:17.911 --> 16:20.178
Because nobody likes working
with the boss's daughter.

16:20.280 --> 16:25.083
Just let him be Santa and please
let me keep a shred of dignity.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.417
I mean, look at me.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.519
I just wanna be
an anonymous elf.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.821
OK, OK.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.590
Those are great.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.427
You better get out there.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.694
Santa needs you.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.863
<i>Go home, Cara.</i>

16:44.938 --> 16:46.004
It's an elf!

16:46.106 --> 16:47.638
It's Santa's elf!

16:47.741 --> 16:49.474
OK, who's next to see Santa?

16:49.576 --> 16:50.308
What's your name?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.410
Holly.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.011
It's Holly the elf.
That's so funny.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.245
Her name's Holly the elf.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.413
OK. Come on.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.415
Go sit in that little chair
over there.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.917
Hi, do you have
your Christmas list.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.386
You sure you're gonna be OK?

17:01.488 --> 17:02.488
Dad.

17:02.589 --> 17:06.089
You're gonna ruin the illusion.

17:06.192 --> 17:06.958
A computer.

17:07.060 --> 17:07.858
Good choice.

17:07.961 --> 17:08.961
Come on, sweetie.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.228
Mommy wants a picture.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.762
Merry Christmas, Todd.

17:12.866 --> 17:13.598
Do you mind?

17:13.700 --> 17:14.398
No, not at all.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.400
Thank you.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.701
Come on, go up there.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.469
Merry Christmas, young lady.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.473
Have you been a good girl?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.675
I thought so.

17:25.779 --> 17:29.047
And is there maybe something
that you want from Santa?

17:36.089 --> 17:38.156
That's an amazing gift.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.258
Picture?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.292
Yes.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.260
Perfect.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.062
OK, Merry Christmas.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.763
Say "Merry Christmas".

17:45.865 --> 17:47.098
Merry Christmas.

17:47.200 --> 17:47.965
Aw, thank you.

17:48.068 --> 17:48.766
Great, Merry Christmas.

17:48.868 --> 17:49.500
Thank you so much.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.436
Merry Christmas.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.237
So, Holly the elf.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.705
I'm afraid so, yep.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.207
And your name is...?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.376
St. Nick.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.944
Funny Santa.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.547
I don't wanna tell you how to
do your job but I had an idea.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.249
Maybe if you usher the kids up
and you take the picture

18:05.318 --> 18:07.151
for the parents and
then we hustle them off

18:07.253 --> 18:08.386
we can keep the line moving.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.721
Sure, great. Great idea.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.023
Alright everybody.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.458
Sorry for the wait.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.493
Get your cameras
and your phones ready

18:15.595 --> 18:17.695
and I'll take the pictures

18:17.797 --> 18:19.575
and we'll get some great shots
of you and Santa.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.265
Come on, it's your turn.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.367
Hi.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.536
Sweetie, let me
take your jacket.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.273
Alright, say "cookies".

18:29.375 --> 18:31.109
Cookies.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.243
Thanks for your help.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.911
I'm gonna post this
on social media.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.779
Great.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.714
He'll be here until six tonight.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.449
Hashtag "Santa at Montell's".

18:38.551 --> 18:39.617
Perfect.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.452
Where do you keep
the princess dresses?

18:41.521 --> 18:43.621
Floor 3, next to kid's shoes.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.723
Thank you.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.023
You good, sweetie?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.126
Merry Christmas.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.261
Merry Christmas.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.164
Hey.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.242
Santa, you need some cookies?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.166
No.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.701
Santa has other needs.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.469
Got it.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.072
You are killing it out there.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.007
You're not so bad yourself,
you're a natural.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.175
Careful.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.843
What, being an elf
isn't a life's dream?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.278
Not exactly.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.314
But I'll do just about anything
for my friend Elle.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.517
Those are some serious boots.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.019
Thanks. We've been through
a lot together.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.188
Holly, there you are.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.756
Hey.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.065
Elle asked me to see if
you guys could head back out.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.760
We just sat down.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.062
Just the messenger.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.397
Nice boots.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.598
Gibney's?

19:27.700 --> 19:28.966
Yeah.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.035
Your eye-stay piece is loose.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.214
Why don't you bring them
by the shoe department,

19:32.238 --> 19:33.070
I'll fix it for you.

19:33.139 --> 19:33.905
Great, thanks so much.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.072
That's awesome.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.908
OK, I'll see you guys out there?

19:37.010 --> 19:37.675
<i>Alright.</i>

19:37.777 --> 19:38.576
Alright.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.343
Great.

19:39.445 --> 19:39.944
Alright.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.379
Back at it.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.713
Do I look OK?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.348
I... so many things
could go wrong.

19:44.450 --> 19:48.319
Actually your bell is crooked.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.987
Thanks.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.993
OK sweetie, it's your turn.

19:56.095 --> 19:56.861
I like your antlers.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.963
Ho, ho, ho.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.097
Merry Christmas,
what's your name?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.401
Would you like to tell Santa
what you want for Christmas?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.814
You wanna bet this next guy's
a slugger?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.171
A slugger?

20:08.608 --> 20:09.674
Hi.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.986
What do you want for Christmas?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.610
Easy.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.878
Boxing gloves?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.446
OK, cool. High five.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.548
Open fist.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.315
There you go.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.182
Merry Christmas.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.617
Merry Christmas.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.018
How did you know?

20:21.120 --> 20:22.620
Santa's intuition?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.388
I didn't think
you meant literally.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.923
Yeah.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.659
OK, so I have to look out for
sluggers and what else is there?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.261
I don't know, let's see.

20:30.964 --> 20:31.896
Hi.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.831
You want to sit next to Santa?

20:34.634 --> 20:35.032
Nope.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.000
OK.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.568
Snubber.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.403
Couldn't care less.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.871
I feel for you.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.107
Those are the ones that hurt.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.542
How's it going?

20:44.644 --> 20:48.012
Great, but I think Santa
needs his halftime break.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.182
I know a place where you can
get lunch without any snubbers.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.783
Down the hall.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.952
Santa needs to have
his milk and cookies

20:55.054 --> 20:57.588
but he'll be back in 30 minutes.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.725
I've been catching the
parents in line and asking them

21:00.827 --> 21:03.427
what they need to get their kids
for Christmas

21:03.529 --> 21:05.507
and then telling them
where to get it in the store.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.531
I love it.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.532
Even better,
let's do it for them.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.200
Perfect.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.668
Yeah.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.909
OK, it looks like we have turkey
and ham.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.345
Ham please.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.180
Okay.

21:27.086 --> 21:32.923
What is it that you do
when you're not being Santa?

21:33.026 --> 21:34.026
Lumberjack?

21:34.060 --> 21:35.526
Kind of, yeah.
How'd you know?

21:35.628 --> 21:36.628
Seriously?

21:36.696 --> 21:38.129
Yeah.

21:38.231 --> 21:41.899
I... it's just that you look more
like Paul Bunyan than Santa.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.834
Don't tell the bosses that.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.237
Your secret's safe with me.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.838
OK.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.749
OK, you're next.

22:00.253 --> 22:00.951
Hope on up there.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.286
Hi.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.656
Two of you.

22:05.758 --> 22:06.524
Nice.

22:06.626 --> 22:07.825
Picture?

22:07.894 --> 22:08.592
Mom!

22:08.695 --> 22:09.260
Holly.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.261
Mom?

22:10.363 --> 22:12.530
Check you out.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.365
What are you doing here?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.101
Well, when your father told us
why you didn't come home

22:17.203 --> 22:19.637
we thought we better come
and see for ourselves.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.405
Do you need more help dear?

22:21.507 --> 22:25.443
I swear I've got an elf suit
packed away somewhere.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.311
Only if mom wears one, too.

22:28.214 --> 22:28.979
We could start a trend.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.748
Multi-generational elves.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.751
Elaine, Ivy, what about it?

22:33.853 --> 22:37.555
I always knew that suit
would come in handy.

22:37.623 --> 22:38.989
But mom, seriously.

22:39.092 --> 22:39.857
You gotta go.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.192
Why?

22:41.294 --> 22:43.594
Well, elves don't have moms
checking up on them.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.396
Yes, quite right, the children.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.031
Alright.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.201
OK, bye.

22:50.303 --> 22:51.068
Bye.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.269
Bye.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.105
Is that your mom?

22:54.207 --> 22:56.941
And my grandma and my sister.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.275
That's awesome.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.222
It's so nice to be with family
this time of year.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.246
Is it?

23:01.914 --> 23:03.080
I'm joking.

23:03.182 --> 23:03.981
Where are all the kids?

23:04.083 --> 23:05.449
It's Black Friday.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.018
I guess people are shopping
online nowadays.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.921
There's gotta be some way we can
get more kids over here.

23:11.023 --> 23:15.292
I have an idea but I'll need
some things from my truck

23:15.395 --> 23:16.894
and we'll need a table.

23:16.996 --> 23:17.795
Can we do that?

23:17.897 --> 23:18.897
Sure.

23:18.965 --> 23:19.530
OK.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.798
Alright.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.606
This is such a great idea.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.307
How much should we charge?

23:30.410 --> 23:31.575
Charge?

23:31.677 --> 23:32.710
I don't know.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.677
I never thought about it.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.246
I just make them.

23:35.348 --> 23:36.814
What, you made these?

23:36.916 --> 23:38.883
Yeah.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.217
Hey, guys.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.685
Fun ornaments.

23:41.788 --> 23:42.553
Hey.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.455
Is this Santa's workshop?

23:44.557 --> 23:45.656
It is.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.958
I love it!

23:48.060 --> 23:50.494
I'm gonna make an announcement
on the PA.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.840
Let's draw some business
over here.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.997
Great.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.001
He's adorable.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.473
Someone's here to see
Santa again.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.808
OK, kids.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.710
I hate to ruin the fun but Santa
has some business

24:06.813 --> 24:08.212
up at the North Pole.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.514
He has a long list of gifts
that he has to make for you.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.696
Are you gonna have this
decorating workshop tomorrow?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.019
Hey, Santa!

24:15.121 --> 24:16.720
We doing this tomorrow?

24:16.823 --> 24:17.888
Great.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.057
OK, we'll be here
at 10:00 am.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.192
Tell all your friends.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.027
Hashtag "Santa's workshop
at Montell's".

24:23.129 --> 24:24.495
I did. I will.

24:24.597 --> 24:25.629
Great.

24:25.731 --> 24:26.797
Merry Christmas.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.999
Mommy, can we make an ornament?

24:29.101 --> 24:31.335
Yes, we can come back tomorrow.

24:40.112 --> 24:40.945
Hey there.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.079
Hey.

24:43.749 --> 24:44.815
Thanks.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.885
How's everything going
on the lot?

24:47.987 --> 24:52.890
We've only sold 30 trees an
hour throughout the entire day.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.259
How'd you pull that off?

24:55.361 --> 24:57.795
Ralph let me print out flyers

24:57.864 --> 25:00.197
and I had the 4H kids
pass them out.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.065
Really?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.833
I thought he was against flyers.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.869
He was.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.472
Until he saw the flyer.

25:08.574 --> 25:09.874
That's great.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.842
I'm impressed.

25:11.944 --> 25:16.113
So I thought I would stop by
to see what was going on

25:16.215 --> 25:17.948
between you and Ralph.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.017
It seems kind of weird.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.864
You two are always conspiring
like two thieves

25:21.888 --> 25:26.423
about to break out of jail,
so what's going on?

25:26.526 --> 25:28.759
He wants to retire
after this season.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.062
OK.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.098
Yeah, I don't blame him.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.433
42 Christmas seasons
on some cold dirt,

25:36.536 --> 25:40.538
I'd probably want my spot
on the sand in Aruba, too.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.406
And?

25:42.475 --> 25:45.376
He decided that I had to make
a decision on

25:45.478 --> 25:47.912
whether I was taking over
the business that day.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.847
But I thought that
was your plan,

25:49.916 --> 25:52.983
to take over the business.

25:53.085 --> 25:59.857
Yeah, it is.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.992
But I just need some time.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.894
To do what?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.063
Make ornaments?

26:08.067 --> 26:10.634
OK, Nick.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.303
OK.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.372
You know where to find me,
if you need me.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.048
So much for only an hour?

26:24.150 --> 26:27.117
I am gonna hear about this
when I get home.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.119
Suddenly it's everyone's
business

26:29.221 --> 26:31.121
how I choose to spend
my vacation.

26:31.223 --> 26:34.425
Well, tell them sales went up
five percent in the first hour

26:34.493 --> 26:40.197
you were on the floor as an elf,
and they held steady 'til 5:30.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.834
Normally it drops off around
3:30 on a Black Friday.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.170
I told some parents that we'll
be decorating ornaments

26:46.272 --> 26:48.038
in the morning so I guess
that means...

26:48.140 --> 26:51.008
You have a hot date with
a certain Santa at 10:00 am?

26:51.110 --> 26:51.976
What?

26:52.078 --> 26:53.811
Come on.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.512
You can't fool me.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.014
I got eyes to see.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.749
What are you talking about?

26:58.851 --> 27:02.453
You look at that Santa the way
you looked at Roland Pierce

27:02.555 --> 27:04.088
in the fifth grade.

27:04.190 --> 27:04.989
You remember him?

27:05.091 --> 27:06.590
Yes, I remember him.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.560
He was my boyfriend from
early morning math class

27:09.662 --> 27:12.896
until recess when he moved
on to greener pastures.

27:12.999 --> 27:13.999
He was a player.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.366
He was.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.700
OK, back to Nick.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.769
You are completely delusional.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.871
There is nothing going on
between me and Nick.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.108
Plus, I live like 2,000
miles away.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.677
I am not interested in a
long-distance relationship.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.215
Plus, he's probably married.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.684
Like you didn't notice he
wasn't wearing a wedding ring.

27:33.753 --> 27:36.053
Or he has a girlfriend,
or a significant other.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.454
Whatever.

27:37.556 --> 27:38.822
A guy like that is too...

27:38.924 --> 27:39.690
Gorgeous.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.924
Good with kids.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.129
To be alone.

27:45.231 --> 27:48.298
Well, I could find out.

27:48.401 --> 27:49.266
No.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.267
No, no, no, no, no.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.902
We're not in high school.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.138
I do not need my BFF going
to check

27:54.240 --> 27:57.107
and see if some guy
is available.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.476
Elle.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.047
I mean, I'll be cool about it.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.082
No.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.450
I got... I gotta go.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.285
Promise me.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.422
Fine.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.323
I gotta go pick up
the little guy.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.426
You coming?

28:15.461 --> 28:18.295
Sorry. My real work
needs me.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.297
Alright.

29:06.779 --> 29:10.647
You know, I don't know
how we're gonna keep up.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.283
We went through two boxes
of ornaments today.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.198
I can't believe people are
actually buying them.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.422
Of course they're buying them.

29:17.523 --> 29:18.922
They're amazing.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.191
You know, we could open
this whole area up

29:21.293 --> 29:23.160
and make like a real
Santa's Workshop.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.395
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing.

29:25.498 --> 29:28.499
It feels like it wants to be
something more.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.633
Yeah.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.213
I could bring my work bench,
my tools...

29:31.237 --> 29:31.935
Yeah?

29:32.037 --> 29:33.037
Yeah.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.038
Well, when do you
want to do that?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.274
I don't know, I mean,
I could do it tonight.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.475
Tonight?

29:38.577 --> 29:39.743
Yeah.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.779
That would be great.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.250
Great.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.395
Hey.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.164
Hey.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.332
How're you doing?

30:03.702 --> 30:06.637
You know, I've been
thinking all day

30:06.739 --> 30:10.207
about what I wanted
to say to you

30:10.309 --> 30:14.778
and I came up with
all of these great things

30:14.880 --> 30:18.582
but come back, Nick.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.317
We need you.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.754
Ralph needs you even if
he's too stubborn to say it.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.355
What is going on with you?

30:25.457 --> 30:27.424
Look, he told me to go away
and think about it

30:27.526 --> 30:29.459
until I was ready.

30:29.562 --> 30:34.431
I've been thinking about it
and I'm still not ready.

30:34.533 --> 30:38.302
I thought that this has been
your plan since...

30:38.404 --> 30:40.704
It was.

30:40.806 --> 30:44.842
Are you having second thoughts
about us?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.176
Are you?

30:46.278 --> 30:47.711
I am.

30:47.813 --> 30:50.881
We've been drifting apart
for a long time now.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.951
We don't talk anymore.

30:54.053 --> 30:59.323
I think we should break up.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.892
Yeah, I think you're right.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.563
I think we just want
different things.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.109
So don't tell your mother

31:19.211 --> 31:21.178
but I made some of
my special hot cocoa.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.179
You want some?

31:22.248 --> 31:23.080
Alright.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.481
I'm on vacation.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.652
Coulda fooled me.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.153
Hey, can I ask you a question?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.555
Yeah, shoot.

31:31.657 --> 31:35.225
Why didn't you tell me
that the store was in trouble?

31:35.327 --> 31:38.929
Honey, I just didn't
want you to worry.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.163
Well, I am worried.

31:40.266 --> 31:41.365
Well, don't.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.934
We've got miles to go
before then.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.168
Marshmallows?

31:45.271 --> 31:46.803
You're the worst.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.405
I thought you were on vacation.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.873
Alright, I'll take a few.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.852
You looked great
out there today.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.587
Yeah, it was fun.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.023
Go ahead.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.190
What?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.992
I know there's something
you wanna ask me.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.394
No, no.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.597
Nah, I just... I'm just enjoying
our special tradition.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.403
Well, I gotta head off.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.505
At this hour? Where?

32:21.573 --> 32:24.174
I gotta make some
Christmas magic.

32:38.190 --> 32:38.956
Hey.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.058
Hey.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.058
Out of the Santa suit.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.659
Nice.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.227
You too.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.096
You OK?

32:46.198 --> 32:50.200
You're not your usual
jolly self.

32:50.302 --> 32:54.004
The life of a Montell Santa
isn't always so jolly,

32:54.106 --> 32:57.007
I guess.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.508
You wanna get started?

32:58.577 --> 33:00.077
Yeah.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.125
That looks better.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.865
You really love Christmas,
don't you?

33:54.967 --> 33:55.967
I do.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.734
I really do.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.536
Christmas is a big deal
with my family.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.771
Yeah?

34:00.873 --> 34:04.708
Yeah, Santa and cookies
and decorations and...

34:04.810 --> 34:07.344
and of course there's
the Christmas Eve ball.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.414
I'm told I attended
my first one in diapers.

34:11.617 --> 34:12.882
I've never been.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.650
Are you serious?

34:14.753 --> 34:15.452
Yeah.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.453
How is that possible?

34:16.554 --> 34:17.665
I thought everyone
in Noblesville

34:17.688 --> 34:20.357
has been at least once.

34:20.426 --> 34:24.728
Everyone except me
and maybe my Uncle Ralph.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.063
How's the sign coming?

34:27.132 --> 34:28.565
It's coming.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.301
It looks really good.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.969
I'm impressed.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.041
It looks pretty good.

34:38.143 --> 34:38.909
Are you kidding?

34:39.011 --> 34:40.377
It looks amazing.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.911
You got mad skills, Santa.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.147
I bet by Christmas
it'll be perfect.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.384
So, you never told me
what it is you do

34:47.485 --> 34:49.985
when you're not Santa-ing.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.121
I'm a tree farmer.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.422
A tree farmer.

34:53.525 --> 34:54.525
Yeah.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.033
I should have guessed
by the flannel.

34:56.061 --> 34:57.627
Are you dissing my flannel?

34:57.729 --> 34:59.129
No, no.

34:59.231 --> 35:03.467
I live in Seattle where flannel
is practically a religion.

35:03.569 --> 35:04.634
Seattle?

35:04.703 --> 35:08.405
So are you a sailor
or a computer coder?

35:08.507 --> 35:10.440
No, not quite.

35:10.542 --> 35:15.045
I I'm an executive
at an active wear company.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.848
But I'm also a cyclist
so I fit in.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.583
A cyclist.

35:19.685 --> 35:23.253
Is that a more
serious bicyclist?

35:23.355 --> 35:24.721
I guess.

35:24.823 --> 35:30.060
I mean, I did bike over
1,500 miles last year.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.063
That's impressive.

35:33.165 --> 35:36.199
So I thought you were a
carpenter or like an artist.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.100
I am.

35:37.202 --> 35:38.635
I wanna be.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.537
I make custom furniture.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.805
That's cool.

35:41.907 --> 35:45.675
So you do that and you run
a tree farm?

35:45.777 --> 35:48.612
Well, the farm was owned
by my father and uncle.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.946
Was owned?

35:50.048 --> 35:53.483
Yeah, my dad passed
when I was 14,

35:53.585 --> 35:57.954
so I sorta took over
and run it with my uncle now.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.723
I'm so sorry to hear about
your dad.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.291
Thanks.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.694
What about your mom?

36:04.796 --> 36:07.564
She died two years ago.

36:11.703 --> 36:18.542
I'm officially going to stop
complaining about my mother.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.143
So I mean it's

36:20.245 --> 36:23.313
it's there for me to take over
if I want it to be.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.048
Do you want it?

36:25.150 --> 36:27.150
That's the question everyone
keeps asking me.

36:27.252 --> 36:30.320
Only they don't ask "if",
they ask "when".

36:30.422 --> 36:32.822
I totally get it.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.560
My dad owns a company, too, and

36:36.662 --> 36:39.229
he hasn't asked me in a while
if I'm gonna take over

36:39.331 --> 36:44.100
but I know that he wants me to.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.269
What do you want?

36:48.774 --> 36:49.774
It's hard, isn't it?

36:49.875 --> 36:50.740
It is.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.609
It's so hard.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.346
'Cause I do, but I don't,
you know?

36:56.448 --> 36:59.015
I love my job in Seattle.

36:59.117 --> 37:01.685
I just got a promotion,

37:01.787 --> 37:07.357
I love the pacific northwest,
but my family's here.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.459
My best friend's here,

37:09.561 --> 37:11.361
and I grew up in
my dad's business,

37:11.463 --> 37:12.762
if you know what I mean.

37:12.864 --> 37:16.967
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

37:17.035 --> 37:20.604
Let me know when
you figure it out.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.939
I will.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.409
So did you move to Seattle
for someone?

37:26.511 --> 37:27.811
Yes and no.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.548
I moved there after grad school
with my boyfriend

37:31.650 --> 37:36.019
but when we split up I stayed.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.254
What about you?

37:37.356 --> 37:39.689
Did you stay for someone?

37:39.758 --> 37:42.058
I think I did for a while.

37:42.160 --> 37:47.530
Then I realized I really stayed
for the place itself.

37:47.633 --> 37:51.301
It's funny how it knows you.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.969
It does, doesn't it?

37:53.071 --> 37:54.838
Yeah.

37:54.906 --> 37:58.275
I feel like I can talk to you
about anything.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.377
So do I.

38:14.192 --> 38:14.958
Merry Christmas.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.894
Bye, Merry Christmas.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.029
You were so right.

38:19.131 --> 38:20.530
That area needed trees.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.912
How did you know what it needed?

38:21.967 --> 38:24.901
Santa's intuition?

38:25.003 --> 38:26.536
You know what we should do?

38:26.638 --> 38:29.039
We should have an ornament
decorating contest.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.419
We can announce the winner
with the holiday bake-off winner

38:31.443 --> 38:33.043
at the Christmas Eve ball.

38:33.145 --> 38:33.977
I love it.

38:34.079 --> 38:34.678
Hi.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.612
Hi.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.846
Merry Christmas, man.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.916
Mom, Grammy, Ivy.

38:40.018 --> 38:40.817
Let me guess.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.919
You got the elf costumes.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.354
Where do I change?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.167
I do wish you would stop
bringing that up

38:46.191 --> 38:48.858
as if it actually might happen.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.461
I've always wanted to do that.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.030
Like LeBrain Jones.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.532
LeBron James, Grammy.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.367
But A for effort.

38:57.469 --> 38:58.902
The reason why we're all here

38:59.004 --> 39:00.904
is because we wanted
to bring you this.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.072
It's perfect.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.707
Thanks, Ive, can you put it
over there?

39:03.809 --> 39:05.008
Sure.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.044
I do wish I had a grandchild
to bring to Santa.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.981
And on that note I'm gonna
go look for a gift for Kyle.

39:12.784 --> 39:16.019
Mom, don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

39:16.121 --> 39:18.154
Holly, I have barely seen
you all week,

39:18.256 --> 39:21.024
and did you know that
my daughter is turning 35

39:21.126 --> 39:23.460
on Christmas Eve and she has yet

39:23.562 --> 39:26.162
to tell us who she's bringing
to the Christmas Eve ball?

39:26.264 --> 39:27.330
OK, mom.

39:27.432 --> 39:29.999
Santa does not care
about my love life.

39:30.102 --> 39:31.835
He has Mrs. Claus.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.970
Look who it is again.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.806
Santa, are you flying your plane
to the North Pole?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.108
I am gonna take my plane.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.810
How did you know my sleigh
was out for repairs?

39:40.912 --> 39:44.414
I was thinking very hard with
my brain and I figured it out.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.915
You're very smart.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.183
Put it here.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.754
OK, Merry Christmas.

39:50.856 --> 39:51.488
Bye.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.622
Bye.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.224
Bye.

39:54.326 --> 39:55.692
Ho, ho, ho.

39:55.794 --> 39:59.129
Santa needs to go feed the
reindeers for a little bit.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.564
So I'm gonna take
a little break.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.304
So you must be
Holly's grandmother.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.306
You can call me Grammy.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.841
OK Grammy, I will do that.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.443
Thanks.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.845
You know, I can always use
a good elf around here.

40:15.947 --> 40:19.449
Don't keep a promise
you can't make.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.784
That's... that's so funny,

40:20.886 --> 40:23.420
my mom used to switch up
little sayings like that.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.821
Really?

40:24.923 --> 40:28.258
I only know one person
that did that.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.629
Is your mother Rachael Porter
by any chance?

40:32.731 --> 40:33.797
Yeah.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.232
Well, that's who I got it from.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.168
Well, she could make me
laugh out loud.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.903
How is she?

40:40.005 --> 40:42.572
She passed away a couple
years ago.

40:42.674 --> 40:46.075
I'm so sorry to hear that.

40:46.178 --> 40:48.044
Thank you.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.780
She was such a light in my life.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.115
How did you know her?

40:52.217 --> 40:54.350
I volunteer at the hospital.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.920
You know, I remember she used
to bring you up there

40:57.022 --> 41:01.090
on snow days when she
couldn't cover her shift.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.091
Yeah.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.960
You have an amazing memory.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.502
Well, I'm not one
of those old ladies

41:05.597 --> 41:07.597
who can't remember things.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.166
You're definitely not.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.236
Well Grammy, it looks like Holly
cannot join us for lunch today.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.370
Quite right.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.940
She has big elf
responsibilities.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.108
Yes, she does.

41:19.211 --> 41:20.910
It's so nice to see you again,

41:21.012 --> 41:22.712
but you know, I didn't get
your name.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.113
It's Nick.

41:24.216 --> 41:25.014
Nick.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.349
Yeah.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.551
OK, Grammy, I'll see you soon.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.252
Good.

41:29.354 --> 41:29.919
Bye-bye.

41:30.021 --> 41:30.753
Bye.

41:30.856 --> 41:31.421
Lovely to meet you.

41:31.523 --> 41:32.088
Nice to meet you.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.022
Bye.

41:33.124 --> 41:33.990
Hey.

41:34.092 --> 41:34.757
Let's go.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.226
Thank you.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.666
I think mothers were put on this
earth to torture their children.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.001
I'm so sorry.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.670
I said I was going to stop
complaining about her.

41:47.772 --> 41:48.772
It's OK.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.807
All elves make mistakes.

41:57.516 --> 42:01.050
I think you're gonna want
these on a day like today.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.920
Thank you.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.188
It's you!

42:05.290 --> 42:06.689
It's me.

42:06.791 --> 42:10.226
Well, between the boots
and the eyes I recognize you.

42:10.328 --> 42:13.563
You're actually handsome
without that get-up.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.198
Thank you.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.700
Almost as handsome as JD.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.569
Who's JD?

42:19.671 --> 42:23.039
My husband of 62 years.

42:23.141 --> 42:26.209
You guys had quite the run,
didn't you?

42:26.311 --> 42:27.944
Yes.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.314
JD would have loved
to have seen Holly in there.

42:31.416 --> 42:36.786
She's so like him,
vibrant and kind and so smart.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.354
You must really miss him.

42:38.456 --> 42:40.757
Every day.

42:40.859 --> 42:44.260
We did have something special.

42:44.362 --> 42:47.430
Kind of like what I see
between the two of you.

42:47.532 --> 42:49.065
Holly?

42:49.167 --> 42:53.202
We're not... I mean,
we're friends.

42:53.305 --> 42:56.406
JD and I were friends once, too.

42:56.508 --> 42:58.074
Time will tell.

42:59.511 --> 43:01.344
Alright, I gotta get going.

43:01.446 --> 43:02.645
Stay warm.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.180
You too.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.748
Bye.

43:11.590 --> 43:13.890
Dinner's almost ready.

43:13.992 --> 43:16.826
Remember that trip
we took to California?

43:16.928 --> 43:17.928
I do.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.862
We were visiting your cousins.

43:19.965 --> 43:21.431
You two were so young

43:21.533 --> 43:24.667
I can't believe you actually
remember that trip.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.437
Uncle Jimmy's beach,
that's what I remember.

43:27.539 --> 43:30.239
Visiting Uncle Jimmy's beach.

43:30.342 --> 43:32.275
I think I thought all of
Santa Monica bay

43:32.377 --> 43:34.043
was Uncle Jimmy's beach.

43:37.415 --> 43:39.716
Awe.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.618
Those dresses you and Grammy
made for us

43:41.720 --> 43:43.219
with the fairy tale theme.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.555
Yeah.

43:45.657 --> 43:47.223
I remember it was
a really big deal

43:47.325 --> 43:50.093
that you let me wear that dress.

43:50.195 --> 43:53.663
I had to promise like ten times
not to spill anything.

43:53.765 --> 43:56.566
Well, you didn't disappoint me.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.868
Like I am now?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.371
Disappointing you?

44:02.774 --> 44:05.875
You don't disappoint me.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.044
Is that what you think?

44:08.146 --> 44:10.380
Yeah.

44:10.482 --> 44:14.751
If I don't bring the right guy
to the ball or if I don't...

44:17.088 --> 44:19.756
Honey.

44:19.858 --> 44:23.393
I am so sorry.

44:23.495 --> 44:26.529
You don't disappoint me.

44:26.631 --> 44:34.437
You, married or unmarried,
you are enough.

44:35.807 --> 44:37.306
Thanks, mom.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.709
Holly.

44:39.811 --> 44:42.445
I love you, sweetheart.

44:43.815 --> 44:44.580
Dinner?

44:44.683 --> 44:45.515
Yeah.

44:45.617 --> 44:47.383
Yeah.

45:06.938 --> 45:07.938
Not funny.

45:07.972 --> 45:10.373
You never don't have a joke,
Rob.

45:10.475 --> 45:11.741
Well, always come prepared.

45:11.843 --> 45:14.177
That's the first thing
they tell you in boy scouts.

45:14.279 --> 45:20.383
So I talked to Jenny.

45:20.485 --> 45:21.818
Yeah.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.520
I'm sorry, man.

45:24.622 --> 45:26.589
It's OK.

45:26.691 --> 45:28.091
She was right.

45:28.193 --> 45:30.793
We haven't been connecting
for a while now.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.528
Women.

45:32.630 --> 45:34.897
How do they know
so much about us?

45:41.106 --> 45:43.606
That sigh doesn't sound like
it was about a woman, though.

45:43.708 --> 45:45.975
What a day.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.744
I'm all ears.

45:47.846 --> 45:50.286
Well, one, I think it's weird
you know so much about my sighs,

45:50.381 --> 45:54.150
but two, I forgot how hard
it was to Santa.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.151
You put the suit on?

45:55.253 --> 45:56.652
I put the suit on.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.221
I swore I'd never do it again

45:58.323 --> 46:03.459
and here I am cursing my own
self, Rob you idiot.

46:03.561 --> 46:06.996
I would say I know what you mean
but I don't know.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.564
What?

46:08.666 --> 46:09.666
I love it!

46:09.768 --> 46:10.768
Really?

46:10.869 --> 46:12.168
Yeah, really.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.570
Don't tell me you found
your calling.

46:14.672 --> 46:17.340
I don't know about
my calling but,

46:17.442 --> 46:20.843
you know, the kids are great
and I have this awesome elf

46:20.945 --> 46:22.278
who's helping me out.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.146
Elf?

46:23.248 --> 46:24.480
I didn't send you an elf.

46:24.582 --> 46:27.316
Yeah, I think she's just giving
her friend a hand

46:27.418 --> 46:28.985
from the store.

46:29.087 --> 46:31.254
Now I have more questions.
What's her name?

46:31.356 --> 46:35.925
Her name's Holly,
and she's really funny

46:36.027 --> 46:38.728
and she gets the crowd going
and the kids love her, so...

46:38.830 --> 46:41.063
I don't know.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.699
You like her.

46:43.802 --> 46:44.934
I barely know her.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.637
Sounds like you like her.

46:47.739 --> 46:50.773
Yeah, because you know,
she's... she's really great.

46:50.875 --> 46:52.575
And she's making my job easier.

46:52.677 --> 46:54.277
OK. What's her story?

46:54.379 --> 46:56.245
What do you mean,
what's her story?

46:56.347 --> 46:57.347
What's her last name?

46:57.415 --> 46:58.415
Where'd she go to school?

46:58.449 --> 46:59.682
Where does she live?

46:59.784 --> 47:01.684
These are questions humans
ask other humans

47:01.786 --> 47:03.085
when they like them.

47:03.188 --> 47:05.688
Yeah, OK, well I don't know
her last name, actually.

47:05.790 --> 47:07.790
And I don't know where
she went to school

47:07.892 --> 47:10.293
but none of it really matters
'cause she lives in Seattle.

47:10.395 --> 47:11.227
So?

47:11.329 --> 47:13.196
Seattle Schmeattle.
Who cares?

47:13.298 --> 47:15.198
Like she's gonna move back home

47:15.300 --> 47:17.567
because a complete stranger
likes her.

47:17.669 --> 47:25.074
Well, they say every important
person in your life

47:25.176 --> 47:28.945
starts out a stranger.

47:29.047 --> 47:29.779
Who's they?

47:29.881 --> 47:30.881
I don't know.

47:30.915 --> 47:32.381
I just like the way it sounded.

47:33.318 --> 47:34.784
I'll bring in the team.

47:38.389 --> 47:41.691
Holly, let me introduce Mallory
Tuckman from Wincoff Retail.

47:41.793 --> 47:42.925
Holly Montell.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.160
You're John's daughter.

47:44.262 --> 47:45.728
I am.

47:45.830 --> 47:47.975
And Elle Simmons, our head of
marketing and special events.

47:47.999 --> 47:49.332
Charmed.

47:49.434 --> 47:51.734
Ladies, please join us.

47:51.836 --> 47:54.737
Well, John just took me
on the complete tour.

47:54.839 --> 47:57.773
I have to say you run
a tight ship.

47:57.876 --> 48:00.009
They run the tight ship.

48:00.111 --> 48:02.278
I'm... I'm just a passenger.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.013
Well, I'm gonna cut
to the chase.

48:04.115 --> 48:07.416
You have a thriving business
serving a loyal customer base

48:07.518 --> 48:10.119
and Wincoff Retail has
aggressive growth goals

48:10.221 --> 48:13.489
and to meet them
we need to acquire.

48:13.591 --> 48:15.791
That's where Montell's comes in.

48:15.894 --> 48:19.095
We've actually had our eye on
your store for a few years now.

48:19.197 --> 48:20.897
We're flattered.

48:20.999 --> 48:23.699
Well, why don't we talk
after you've had a chance

48:23.801 --> 48:25.735
to fully review our offer.

48:25.837 --> 48:27.503
Let's do that.

48:28.473 --> 48:30.072
I'll show you out.

48:35.146 --> 48:38.147
Well, I don't have a Christmas
tune for this one.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.158
Hey, hon.

48:49.260 --> 48:51.327
Still working I see.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.462
These gifts aren't gonna
wrap themselves.

48:53.564 --> 48:54.897
You deserve a break.

48:54.999 --> 48:56.832
I love wrapping gifts.

48:56.935 --> 48:58.301
It's therapeutic.

48:58.403 --> 49:00.536
I can't argue with that.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.741
So, see our latest numbers?

49:05.843 --> 49:08.144
I may have taken a look.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.179
So you know how good they are.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.926
And I don't know what's going on
with you and that Santa

49:11.950 --> 49:13.382
but if you figure it out tell me

49:13.484 --> 49:16.419
because I wanna bottle it
and sell it.

49:16.521 --> 49:19.155
I also looked at the offer.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.089
Good.

49:20.191 --> 49:21.191
What do you think?

49:21.259 --> 49:22.491
It's solid.

49:22.593 --> 49:23.492
It is, isn't it?

49:23.594 --> 49:24.894
Yeah.

49:24.996 --> 49:26.295
Yeah.

49:26.397 --> 49:28.197
I know what you're thinking.

49:28.299 --> 49:30.900
Yeah, I am.

49:31.002 --> 49:32.768
I mean, look at what you did
out there.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.004
Santa's corner is the reason
we're 40 percent up

49:35.106 --> 49:36.372
over last year.

49:36.474 --> 49:39.275
You're driving business
throughout the entire store.

49:39.377 --> 49:43.713
So yeah, I wish you could stay.

49:46.517 --> 49:47.883
Hey, I know.

49:47.986 --> 49:49.118
You love Seattle.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.355
You just made VP and
I'm very proud of you.

49:52.457 --> 49:55.358
I was just... I was just dreaming
out loud.

49:58.162 --> 50:02.164
I knew that one day you were
gonna have to sell.

50:02.266 --> 50:06.836
It's just kind of a shock
that that day is already here.

50:10.975 --> 50:14.210
So hey, if after this little
chat you feel like you need

50:14.312 --> 50:16.846
more therapy I got some presents
you can wrap.

50:16.948 --> 50:18.581
Bring 'em on.

50:19.250 --> 50:20.883
I love you, dad.

50:28.893 --> 50:30.092
OK.

50:35.967 --> 50:37.066
Hey.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.445
Good morning, Holly.
You're here early today.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.336
An elf's work is never done.

50:40.438 --> 50:41.537
Are these new?

50:41.639 --> 50:42.639
No.

50:42.740 --> 50:43.806
They've been here a while,

50:43.908 --> 50:47.843
you've just been too busy
to notice them.

50:47.945 --> 50:50.646
You know, they say boots
are coming back.

50:50.748 --> 50:54.917
They're sturdy, comfortable,
and unexpectedly stylish.

50:55.019 --> 50:55.818
Believe me.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.087
I know all about boots.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.390
You know, if you find
a pair that fits

51:01.492 --> 51:04.060
you can wear them forever.

51:13.671 --> 51:15.037
No, I'm telling you.

51:15.106 --> 51:18.774
Emma wanted a basketball,
Abby wanted a doctor's kit,

51:18.876 --> 51:20.576
Connor wanted a dump truck...

51:20.678 --> 51:21.911
You are making all of this up.

51:21.979 --> 51:23.212
I'm not.

51:23.314 --> 51:24.958
Sarah wanted an art kit
and she was very specific

51:24.982 --> 51:26.348
about the colours.

51:26.451 --> 51:28.851
There is no way you remember
what all these kids want.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.119
It's a steel trap.

51:30.221 --> 51:31.387
I'm not convinced.

51:31.489 --> 51:33.556
I'm Santa, I know
what the kids want.

51:33.658 --> 51:35.858
You, on the other hand, though,
I'm not so sure about.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.660
Me?

51:37.762 --> 51:39.795
Well, I want what every
elf wants.

51:39.897 --> 51:41.197
What does every elf want?

51:41.299 --> 51:42.865
A toy for every child.

51:42.967 --> 51:44.800
Of course.

51:46.070 --> 51:48.104
I don't know, I'm new
to this elf thing.

51:48.206 --> 51:49.738
Apparently, it goes
with the job.

51:49.841 --> 51:51.281
I can get behind a toy
for every kid.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.641
I'm Santa.

51:52.743 --> 51:54.910
But what else?

51:55.012 --> 51:58.781
I want to find my true North.

51:58.850 --> 52:03.219
And I really, really

52:03.321 --> 52:04.920
want a new hat.

52:15.633 --> 52:19.068
Sorry kids, Santa will be
back tomorrow at 10:00 am.

52:19.170 --> 52:20.836
He's gotta go get some
milk and cookies.

52:20.905 --> 52:22.671
<i>Awe.</i>

52:22.773 --> 52:25.040
It's OK, we'll come back.
Let's go.

52:26.110 --> 52:27.990
I'm thinking no milk and cookies
for me tonight.

52:28.079 --> 52:31.180
I've actually got a beer waiting
for me at the Santa convention.

52:31.282 --> 52:32.081
The Santa convention?

52:32.183 --> 52:33.482
Yeah.

52:33.584 --> 52:36.919
Supposedly all the local Santas,

52:37.021 --> 52:39.555
meet up at Malone's Bar
on the 20th every year

52:39.657 --> 52:43.392
to celebrate, commiserate,
you name it.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.394
I gotta see this.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.363
You should come.

52:47.465 --> 52:50.766
Wait, are you inviting me,
an elf,

52:50.868 --> 52:54.003
to the Santa convention?

52:54.105 --> 52:56.005
Maybe I am.

52:56.107 --> 52:58.340
Maybe you'll see me there.

52:58.409 --> 53:01.544
Great. Maybe you should come
at 8:00.

53:01.646 --> 53:03.245
Maybe.

53:11.923 --> 53:13.155
No.

53:13.257 --> 53:15.157
We can't do that.

53:15.259 --> 53:18.260
Because it's against our policy.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.462
With you in just one second,
ma'am.

53:20.565 --> 53:21.830
I know.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.299
My hands are tied.

53:23.401 --> 53:24.099
OK.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.734
Do your best.

53:26.204 --> 53:27.436
How can I help you?

53:27.505 --> 53:29.572
Hi, I'm Holly Montell.

53:29.674 --> 53:33.442
I called earlier from Montell's
department store in Noblesville.

53:33.544 --> 53:34.688
I don't know if you've
heard of it.

53:34.712 --> 53:35.444
I've heard of it.

53:35.546 --> 53:36.586
My mom used to work there.

53:36.681 --> 53:37.580
Really?

53:37.682 --> 53:39.348
Yeah, in cosmetics.
Jan Darling.

53:39.450 --> 53:41.550
Mrs. Darling.
How is she?

53:41.652 --> 53:42.851
She's good.

53:42.954 --> 53:45.721
Retired, lots of gardening,
watching grand-babies.

53:46.857 --> 53:48.824
Please tell her I said hello.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.326
I'm... I'm sorry,
what was your name?

53:50.394 --> 53:51.060
Jordie.

53:51.162 --> 53:52.962
Jordie. Nice to meet you.

53:53.064 --> 53:55.831
I... I just had a question.

53:55.933 --> 53:57.967
How long have you worked here?

53:58.069 --> 53:59.335
Seven years.

53:59.437 --> 54:02.504
OK, so you were here
before new management.

54:02.607 --> 54:04.240
Yep.

54:04.308 --> 54:06.675
How are things different?

54:09.380 --> 54:11.647
We're more efficient,

54:11.716 --> 54:14.650
but if you ask me the heart's
gone out of this place.

54:17.655 --> 54:19.521
Why do you ask?

54:19.624 --> 54:22.791
Wincoff Retail offered
to buy Montell's.

54:22.893 --> 54:25.761
You stand to make
a lot from that.

54:25.863 --> 54:27.563
Probably.

54:27.665 --> 54:29.965
Well, what's your heart worth?

54:38.409 --> 54:39.808
Santa.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.176
Yeah.

54:41.245 --> 54:44.013
Hey, I thought I would take
you up on your offer

54:44.115 --> 54:45.381
to fix my boots.

54:45.483 --> 54:47.182
Yes.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.096
'Cause I love it when people
repair their shoes

54:49.120 --> 54:50.919
instead of just tossing
them out.

54:51.022 --> 54:52.821
I would never toss them out.

54:52.923 --> 54:53.689
I love 'em.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.491
I even have a nickname for them.

54:55.559 --> 54:57.393
Really?

54:57.495 --> 54:58.661
Yeah, I'm not gonna tell you.

54:59.764 --> 55:00.596
OK.

55:00.698 --> 55:02.998
Well put your name there.

55:03.067 --> 55:04.466
Alright.

55:04.568 --> 55:07.002
And I will fill out the rest.

55:08.472 --> 55:09.371
Here you go.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.173
Thank you.

55:12.977 --> 55:15.244
Your name is seriously Nick?

55:15.346 --> 55:16.679
It is, I swear.

55:16.781 --> 55:18.681
Well, I will have these for you,
Nick,

55:18.783 --> 55:20.649
before your next shift.

55:20.751 --> 55:23.319
Thank you. I really
appreciate it.

55:40.271 --> 55:41.637
Hi.

55:41.739 --> 55:44.273
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

55:47.812 --> 55:49.778
There you are.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.548
You made it.

55:52.650 --> 55:54.928
I can't believe I found you
in a room of a zillion Santas.

55:54.952 --> 55:55.784
It's crazy.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.786
This is, I know.

55:58.989 --> 56:00.189
What do you want to drink?

56:00.291 --> 56:02.391
White wine please.

56:02.493 --> 56:03.559
You look amazing.

56:03.661 --> 56:04.661
Thank you.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.361
You look...

56:05.463 --> 56:06.261
Yeah.

56:06.364 --> 56:07.730
The same.

56:07.832 --> 56:09.732
Well, you can't come
to the Santa convention

56:09.834 --> 56:10.834
in your street clothes.

56:12.136 --> 56:14.703
Excuse me, since when
does Santa wear sneakers?

56:14.805 --> 56:15.838
These?

56:15.940 --> 56:17.380
Well, my Gibney's
took the night off.

56:17.408 --> 56:20.109
They've been working hard,
they deserve it.

56:20.211 --> 56:23.278
I noticed there are no elves
at this convention.

56:23.381 --> 56:24.381
Yeah, no elves.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.115
They gotta get themselves
organized.

56:26.217 --> 56:28.517
We're the unsung heroes
of Christmas, we elves.

56:28.619 --> 56:29.619
Absolutely.

56:29.720 --> 56:30.986
Thank you.

56:31.088 --> 56:31.787
To elves.

56:31.889 --> 56:33.188
To elves.

56:35.826 --> 56:37.926
So tell me the truth.

56:38.028 --> 56:40.362
Is your last name Claus?

56:40.464 --> 56:42.865
You ask tough questions.

56:42.967 --> 56:45.801
A man of mystery.

56:45.903 --> 56:47.314
I guess it's a little unfair,
though.

56:47.338 --> 56:49.938
I do know a bit more about you
than you know about me.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.573
How's that?

56:51.675 --> 56:54.076
I mean, I know your birthday.

56:54.178 --> 56:55.711
Right. My mom.

56:55.813 --> 56:57.179
Thanks mom.

56:57.281 --> 56:59.326
I know what it's like to have
a birthday on a big day,

56:59.350 --> 57:01.784
even better a big birthday
on a big day.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.118
Really?

57:03.220 --> 57:06.789
Try and top having your birthday
on Christmas Eve.

57:06.891 --> 57:08.624
Valentine's Day.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.859
Valentine's Day? No.

57:10.961 --> 57:11.961
Yes.

57:12.062 --> 57:13.062
No.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.363
That is so much worse.

57:14.465 --> 57:15.631
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

57:15.699 --> 57:17.800
That is so much worse,
especially for a guy.

57:17.902 --> 57:20.335
I'll drink to that.

57:20.438 --> 57:23.138
It's bad enough having your
birthday being made a big deal of

57:23.207 --> 57:26.275
but to have your birthday
and your love life

57:26.377 --> 57:29.812
being made a big deal of
every year?

57:31.682 --> 57:34.149
Sorry.

57:35.986 --> 57:38.687
And plus, I mean, this year
is the big 35.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.522
Brace yourself now.

57:40.624 --> 57:43.425
Trying to brace myself.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.127
I'm sorry.

58:00.845 --> 58:02.377
Sorry.

58:03.414 --> 58:04.414
No.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.181
Is everything OK.

58:06.283 --> 58:08.217
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

58:08.886 --> 58:10.052
OK.

58:10.154 --> 58:12.988
I'm sorry.
It's an emergency.

58:13.090 --> 58:15.123
I totally understand.

58:15.226 --> 58:16.525
I'm so sorry.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.634
What happened?

58:25.736 --> 58:27.936
He was complaining
about being cold,

58:28.038 --> 58:30.239
he wouldn't go to the hut
to warm up.

58:30.307 --> 58:35.177
I forgot about it and then
he just fell over.

58:35.279 --> 58:37.412
I'll give you two a minute.

58:48.792 --> 58:53.328
Hey.

58:53.430 --> 58:57.232
You know if you wanted to see me
all you had to do was call.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.472
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

59:07.144 --> 59:09.611
I'm fine, I told you I don't
need to be here.

59:09.713 --> 59:12.915
I always say when I see a farmer
I know it's serious.

59:13.017 --> 59:14.783
Farmers never go
to the hospital.

59:14.885 --> 59:15.918
What does that mean?

59:16.020 --> 59:17.953
It's just an observation.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.454
Well, you have hypothermia, sir.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.324
And a heart palpitation
that needs monitoring.

59:22.426 --> 59:24.560
But with proper care he can
be home in a few days.

59:24.662 --> 59:26.862
However, no more working
outdoors in the cold.

59:26.964 --> 59:29.031
You need to rest and recuperate.

59:29.133 --> 59:30.133
Thank you.

59:30.200 --> 59:31.934
I'll be back to check
on you later.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.385
Is this why you insisted
that I take over

59:38.409 --> 59:40.943
the day before Thanksgiving?

59:41.045 --> 59:44.379
I want you to take over
because...

59:45.883 --> 59:48.016
the farm is yours.

59:48.118 --> 59:50.419
It's your inheritance.

59:50.521 --> 59:54.656
And it's what your father wanted
for you.

59:54.758 --> 59:56.158
It's time.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.016
What's going on?

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:21.984
What do you mean?

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:23.619
You never sing with me.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.190
You're in love.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.292
What?

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.993
With that Santa.

01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:33.495
Stop, I'm not in love.

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:36.665
Yet.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.868
Holly, you better snatch him up
while there's still time.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:44.640
Speaking of time, this elf
has to get to the North Pole.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:48.710
Holly!

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:49.578
Take these to Nick?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.113
Of course.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:59.888
That's, like, 13 gifts.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.924
You know what? Sure.

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:06.361
I see a lot of sluggers
in this line.

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:10.332
Where's Nick?

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.669
It's St. Nick to you,
my dear.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.237
Look, it's one of my elves.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.506
Ho, ho, ho.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:21.276
You're next.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.111
Hop on up there.
There you go.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.680
I'll be right back.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.316
OK, one gift.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:29.951
What do you want?

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:33.055
Hey, where do we get
our Santa's?

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.890
Rob's Holiday Staffing, why?

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.225
I need to find out what happened
to our Santa.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:38.460
He's not out there?

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:40.595
No, it's just some old guy.

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:43.398
He left his boots with Arturo
last night and he put his name

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.335
on this work order form
but I can't read it.

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:50.672
Could be Parker?

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:52.808
Let's call the staffing company.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.252
You OK?

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:06.822
Yeah, go ahead.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:08.657
Rob's Holiday Staffing,
Rob speaking.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:09.825
Hi.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:11.404
I'm calling from Montell's
department store

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:12.761
regarding our Santa.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:13.895
Hi.

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:14.796
Did he show up?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:15.997
Yes.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.166
It's just that we're
a little concerned.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.903
We were really happy
with the Santa you sent before.

01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:23.772
Nick?

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.974
Nick had a family emergency.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.209
Right.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.677
I'm so sorry.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:31.113
<i>I hope everything's OK.</i>

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.681
I think so.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:35.584
<i>Well, please tell him that
we hope everything improves</i>

01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:37.819
and we'd like
to send him a card.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.822
Is it alright if we send it
to Nick Parker,

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:43.158
<i>care of Rob's Holiday Staffing?</i>

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.860
Yeah, that's fine.

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:47.329
I'm... I'm sorry,
are you still there?

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:48.597
Hello?

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:49.331
Hello?

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.032
She's gone.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.601
OK.

01:02:52.703 --> 01:02:54.336
Hello?

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:09.785
I hate tapioca.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:12.220
Nobody hates tapioca.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.122
I do.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.024
What? I do.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:16.892
See? What'd I tell you?

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:18.426
It tastes awful.

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.573
Well, let's get this exam over
so I can get you some jello.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:22.164
OK, now you're talking.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:24.499
Alright, time to get
my own tapioca.

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:25.467
Take mine.

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:26.868
Please.

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:28.570
Hey, bro.

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:29.905
Hey.

01:03:30.574 --> 01:03:31.807
Hey man.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.009
Thanks for coming, guys.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:34.676
Yeah.

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:35.877
How is he?

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.679
Stubborn.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:39.147
What else is new?

01:03:42.286 --> 01:03:43.286
It never ends.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:44.286
That's fine, take it, Rob.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:45.020
Yeah?

01:03:45.122 --> 01:03:45.954
Yeah.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.088
OK, two minutes.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:47.923
Hello?

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:48.723
Hey.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.258
Hey.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.127
You wanna talk?

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.229
Sure.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.763
OK, let's go.

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:57.566
Thanks again for bringing
him in,

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:59.201
for being there.

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.770
I'm glad I was.

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:02.737
How's everything over
at the lot?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.005
Do I need to go over there?

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:05.674
Nah.

01:04:05.776 --> 01:04:06.856
Things have slowed down now

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:08.188
that we're so close
to Christmas.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.978
My brother's got it covered.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.581
OK, good.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.349
I don't know if Ralph told you

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:18.854
but this season has been
our best in over ten years.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:19.788
Really?

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:20.956
Yeah.

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.958
I've been able to do all of
these things

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.693
that I wanted to do.

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:27.829
At first I was upset with you
for leaving us with so much to do

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:33.468
but then I realized
I can do this myself.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.004
Jenny, that's really amazing.

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:41.076
And I've had so many
ideas and...

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:45.780
not arguing with you about them
has just been easier.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:47.382
I get it.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:50.852
And I'm glad.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:53.922
Friends?

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:56.291
Of course, friends.

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.396
Anything?

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:05.533
Who knew there were so many
Nick Parkers?

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:07.502
But no Santa Nick.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.004
I know. This is impossible.

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:11.306
We're never gonna find him.

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:33.896
Holls?

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.233
Maybe we're going about this
the wrong way.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:40.502
Yeah?

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:42.637
I have an idea.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.708
Really?

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:02.991
It's pretty perfect?

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:04.459
I don't know.

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:05.293
What do you mean?

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:07.228
It's brilliant.

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:09.431
We're already getting buzz
on social media.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:13.568
We're driving business to the
store and finding your Santa.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:14.736
Not so far.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.471
We will.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.106
I know it.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.510
OK.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.213
You're out of the elf
outfit already?

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.850
So?

01:06:28.952 --> 01:06:33.054
Listen, I wanted to tell you,
I went to Broman's in Carmel.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:33.955
You did?

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.234
When did you find time for that?

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:38.526
Well, after my elf duties I

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.962
squeezed in a scout
the offer trip.

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.597
OK.

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:45.066
And I ran into Jan Darling's
daughter.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.528
She's worked there
for seven years.

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.236
Jan, she was a great employee.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.171
Yeah.

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:52.607
And?

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:56.945
She said the heart's gone
from the place, dad.

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.713
So the offer's good for us.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:06:59.848
Us?

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:02.283
You.

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:05.220
You're the reason Christmas
was such a success.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.721
You cracked the code.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:10.992
Well, who knew the code was
an elf suit and a young Santa?

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.994
It surprised me.

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:14.307
I thought you were gonna
kill Elle

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:15.475
when she made you
put that outfit on.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:16.499
Yeah.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:17.999
I couldn't have done it.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:22.370
I really enjoyed being there
with the kids and the parents

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.617
and all the customers who have
been coming to the store

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:29.077
for as long as I can remember,
and they're bringing their kids.

01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:31.946
Those kids are our future.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:38.887
It was rewarding and fun
and the numbers went up.

01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:40.522
But?

01:07:40.624 --> 01:07:47.762
But it's all making it
so much harder.

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:49.798
So.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.535
That's that.

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.170
Accept the offer.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:58.640
Yeah.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:03.711
Hey.

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:07.148
My little elf.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.551
You put a lot of heart
into your work,

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:11.453
and that's good.

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:15.156
Save some heart for the other
parts of your life.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.258
Promise me.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:20.862
OK.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:22.697
That's done.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.745
This is a great idea, Holly.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:40.582
It was all Elle.

01:08:40.684 --> 01:08:42.750
Gotta go, it's crazy in here.

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:46.654
This is so fun, right?

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.756
Right?

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.291
Why am I doing this?

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:51.559
What do you mean?

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.828
Why am I trying to find him?

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.296
I'm sorry, is this
a trick question?

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.532
No, seriously.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.969
I leave in two weeks, I love
my job in Seattle,

01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:05.073
I live in one of the most
beautiful cities in the world.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:06.674
Close your eyes.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:07.675
What?

01:09:07.777 --> 01:09:09.477
Just do it.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.781
Tell me, what's your
favourite colour.

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:14.948
You know it's blue.

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.317
Favourite Christmas song?

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:17.484
"The Christmas Song".

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.731
- Beach or mountains?
- Mountains.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:19.854
- Favourite name?
- Nick.

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:22.357
Ha.

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:24.926
And that's why you're doing it.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.694
Holly, I have never
seen you happier

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.997
than when you're with him.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:30.430
Yeah?

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.899
Yeah.

01:09:32.002 --> 01:09:34.301
And if you don't at least
try to find him

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.571
you'll always wonder
what might have been.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:37.738
OK.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.441
You know you're
kind of brilliant, right?

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.443
Well, I mean, I wouldn't say it

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:44.679
but if you wanna say it.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:45.613
I love you.

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.082
I love you.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:51.185
OK, I gotta go find out why
the sale signs aren't up.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:01.996
He'll be back.

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:06.034
Why is everyone so sure?

01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:10.805
I'm sure he already misses...
his boots.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.985
<i>You're starting to look like
your old self, Uncle Ralph.</i>

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:27.155
See? I told you I was fine.

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:28.723
Hey, I didn't say anything.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.102
It was that lady
in the white coat

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:32.827
that was making all the fuss.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:35.997
Yeah, maybe she's right.

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:38.666
Maybe I did need to take it
a little easy.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:40.835
I mean, she may know
a thing or two,

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:43.071
she's a doctor after all.

01:10:43.173 --> 01:10:45.039
So what's the word?

01:10:47.244 --> 01:10:51.879
I can't work the lot anymore,
so you gotta take over.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:55.817
Uncle Ralph, I love working
with you

01:10:55.919 --> 01:11:01.222
and I'm so grateful for
everything you've done for me.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:07.528
You know, you taught me to be
responsible and honest,

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:12.533
but the farm and the business,
it just isn't for me,

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:15.470
and this is probably the hardest
thing I'll ever do.

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:21.042
But I love making furniture,
and I'm good at it,

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:23.578
and I wanna follow that.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.750
I figured you'd say something
like that.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:32.754
But you do make good furniture,
though.

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:33.921
You think so?

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:36.291
Yeah.

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:40.228
I also may have a solution
that would let you retire

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.697
and me do what I love.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.732
Yeah. What's that?

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:46.868
Hand the farm over to Jenny.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.169
Jenny?

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:49.904
Yeah.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:53.775
I mean, she loves it,
she's great at it.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:58.346
She said you guys had the best
season in 10 years.

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:00.648
What do you think?

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:05.386
Well, she's a hard worker.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:06.988
Works harder than anyone.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.623
Yeah.

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:09.725
Jenny.

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:18.866
Well, I think you may be right.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.698
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:29.771
You did this.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.739
All this.

01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:34.242
It happened because of you.

01:13:34.344 --> 01:13:36.310
Thanks, dad.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:42.383
You know what I'm thinking?

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:46.087
Some special hot cocoa
when we get home?

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.833
Thank you.

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:02.804
Hi.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.539
Grammy, what're you doing here?

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:08.209
I'll ask you the same question,
Saint Nick.

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:11.045
Just visiting my uncle,
but as me.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.114
Well, I hope everything's OK.

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:14.115
Thanks.

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:15.950
Yeah, we're getting there.

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:19.053
You know, you never got to put
your elf suit on.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:24.625
Sadly, not my only regret
in life.

01:14:24.727 --> 01:14:26.961
You know, I'm so glad
I bumped into you.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.597
Do you have plans
on Christmas Eve?

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.767
You sure know how
to put a guy on the spot.

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:35.236
Well, at my age I don't want
to waste time,

01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:37.705
you know, dancing around
the subject.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.674
No, ma'am, I don't have
any plans,

01:14:39.776 --> 01:14:41.042
but don't tell anybody

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:43.044
because I don't want them
worrying about Santa.

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:46.747
How would you like to be my
guest at the Christmas Eve ball?

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:48.850
You could be my one plus.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.452
You know, I'm just really not
in the party mood.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.288
You have a girlfriend.

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:55.990
There you go again.

01:14:56.092 --> 01:14:57.892
No, I don't.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.861
Well, then you'll be my guest.

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:03.197
I'll leave a ticket at will call
under my name.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:05.700
You know, I just don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it.

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:08.636
It's impossible to say no to me.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:09.804
Is it?

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:11.272
Futile is resistance.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:14.542
There you go again,
slaying me with those sayings.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:18.279
How about I say
I'll think about it?

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:20.214
Arrive at 8:00.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:23.618
Put on a nice jacket and a tie.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.887
And don't forget
your dancing shoes.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:27.121
No Santa suit?

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:30.057
Give the old boy a rest.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.560
There's my car.

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:33.672
Let me give you a hand.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.396
Thank you.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.799
The ticket will be
under my name,

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:41.135
Adeline Montell.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:44.272
I know you won't disappoint me.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:49.243
Adeline Montell?

01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:10.565
I really appreciate all this,
Elle,

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.500
but it's just one Christmas wish

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:13.935
that's not gonna come true.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.603
Hey, you don't know that yet.

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:18.072
It's not Christmas.

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:20.708
Hey.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:30.151
I love you, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.286
I love you, too.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:37.525
And nothing says
you gotta go back.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.595
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:43.264
we would like to begin
by thanking you very much

01:16:43.366 --> 01:16:45.299
for joining us here
this evening.

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:47.101
We should head in.

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:48.336
Yeah.

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:49.548
<i>It's your support year
after year that makes</i>

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:52.473
<i>the Christmas Eve ball
such a success.</i>

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:57.712
And now, the winner
of the holiday bake-off...

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:01.182
Alegra Hunter and her caramel
macchiato bundt cake.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.389
You came.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:09.523
I did.

01:17:09.626 --> 01:17:11.525
Merry Christmas, my dear.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.194
Merry Christmas, Grammy.

01:17:13.296 --> 01:17:14.629
Allow me.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:16.964
And of course our
newest competition,

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:20.434
the ornament decorating
competition...

01:17:20.536 --> 01:17:21.936
Nicola Rose.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:29.810
I need to stop here
for a second.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:32.413
I thought you might.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:38.452
How're you doing, old girls?

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:39.987
Looking good tonight.

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:43.124
Please be careful
when trying the boots on.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.796
I've got a difficult
announcement tonight.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:52.667
It's something I spent a lot
of thought on.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.138
Wait, you're him.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.740
You're Santa... I mean,
you're Nick?

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.375
Yeah.

01:18:02.045 --> 01:18:03.544
...but this is something
bittersweet

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:06.714
that's been in the works
for a long time.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:11.252
I am very proud of what we have
built here at Montell's

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:14.622
over the years and I...
excuse me.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:16.090
<i>That's my daughter.</i>

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.591
What is it Holly?

01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:20.961
Don't sell, dad.
I'm staying.

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:26.600
As I was saying, I have
a big announcement tonight.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:32.540
This year was a roller-coaster

01:18:32.642 --> 01:18:35.843
until a magical elf
joined our team.

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.778
My daughter's worked
at Montell's on and off

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.113
since she was very young.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.148
She knows the business well,

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:45.586
but this year she proved that
she is the key to our future.

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:49.423
I am excited and very proud
to introduce

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:54.195
the new CEO of Montell's
department store,

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:55.796
is Holly Montell.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:56.898
Yes!

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.503
Holly Montell?

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.107
She's in there somewhere.

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:08.209
Go find her.

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:11.078
<i>Thank you dad.</i>

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.279
<i>Thank you everyone.</i>

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:14.315
<i>I can't wait to get started.</i>

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:20.287
Come here, girl.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.356
Congratulations.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:24.425
I can't believe I get you back.

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:27.528
I don't know why it took me
so long to figure it out.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.564
We're going to make
an unbelievable team.

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:32.399
Excuse me, Elle,
I have to steal her.

01:19:32.502 --> 01:19:33.634
Yeah. Of course.

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:35.803
I have to get home
before Santa does,

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:39.473
so Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas.

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.142
Merry Christmas.

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:44.211
So, nice surprise to me you
did not sing "happy birthday"

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:45.479
so thank you.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:49.650
I think this is a much
better surprise.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:52.953
A celebratory father-daughter
dance?

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:54.889
A celebratory dance.

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:01.797
So what was it?

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:03.063
What do you mean?

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:06.233
What was it that made you
change your mind?

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.135
Falling in love.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:11.272
With the store,
with Noblesville.

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:14.341
It's as if it knows me.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:18.245
What about Wincoff Retail?

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:19.680
You said it,

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:23.150
I couldn't let them take
the heart out of our store.

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:27.822
And I may have built a 30-day
out clause into the contract.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:34.495
I thought just maybe
you might come around.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.034
May I have this dance?

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:41.836
I'm gonna go find your mom.

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:45.673
How...?

01:20:45.741 --> 01:20:47.374
Am I here?

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.877
Well, your grandmother can be
very persuasive.

01:20:49.979 --> 01:20:52.279
Yes.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:53.414
You had an emergency.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:55.049
Is everything OK?

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:56.183
Yeah.

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:57.918
Everything is great.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.453
And happy birthday.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:02.056
Thank you.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:04.692
So you are

01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:07.661
the new CEO of Montell's,
congratulations.

01:21:07.763 --> 01:21:10.231
I decided to come back
to the family business.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.066
So you figured it out.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.334
I did.

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:17.171
With a little help from Santa.

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:19.173
And I saw that there was
a boot contest.

01:21:19.275 --> 01:21:20.975
Were you really gonna give
my boots away?

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:23.611
Only to the rightful owner,
I promise.

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:32.953
So, what do you think?

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.155
The famous Christmas Eve ball.

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:38.726
Admit it, you wish you'd come
every year.

01:21:38.828 --> 01:21:43.063
I wish I had come every year.

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:46.400
And I'm glad I dressed up.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.636
You do look dashing.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:55.009
I'm glad you're here.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:57.544
I'm really glad I'm here, too.

01:22:02.318 --> 01:22:03.684
I'm sorry.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:06.020
Santa's boots.

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:42.156
Alright, alright.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:45.059
This is really
impressive wrapping.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:46.961
Open it and find out.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.230
I love it.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.665
Love it.

01:22:51.767 --> 01:22:53.767
That's lovely, Holly.

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:56.637
Flannel from Seattle.

01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:57.938
It's gorgeous.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:01.909
Look at that colour.

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:04.611
But the real gift is being
here with you,

01:23:04.714 --> 01:23:06.847
Uncle Ralph and the rest
of your family.

01:23:06.949 --> 01:23:07.982
<i>Maui?</i>

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:09.316
Mom!

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:10.217
Dad!

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.720
Maui!

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.090
What is this?

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:17.825
Just something I made.

01:23:19.195 --> 01:23:21.695
I love it.

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:23.731
<i>That's adorable.</i>

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:26.600
And he made it, yeah.

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:28.202
<i>Look at that.</i>

01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:30.771
I figured it'll tide you over
until it's cycling weather.

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:35.376
It'll tide me over,
as long as you come with it.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:44.918
Calm down, mom.
