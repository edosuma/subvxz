[Alba] <i>A long time ago,</i>
<i>I had something like a family,</i>

00:12.320 --> 00:14.440
<i>but I lost it when I arrived in Madrid.</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:19.240
So I was in the middle of Madrid,
with no money

00:19.320 --> 00:21.640
and I without the address
of the boardinghouse,

00:21.720 --> 00:24.280
all because of that man
who had stolen my purse.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.480
What did you do?
Were there any policemen around?

00:27.560 --> 00:31.240
Not even one.
I went into the first hotel I found.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.200
[Carmen] Let me guess. The Palace?

00:35.200 --> 00:38.560
[Alba] The Florida, right there in Callao.
[chuckles]

00:39.160 --> 00:42.400
It wasn't a palace,
but they treated me like a queen.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.600
[Alba] <i>The fact is, street girls like me</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:50.080

00:59.720 --> 01:01.320
<i>what else binds a family?</i>

01:02.200 --> 01:03.480
[chuckles]

01:03.560 --> 01:06.360
<i>What is behind that facade of perfection?</i>

01:08.280 --> 01:11.120
<i>Every family has secrets.</i>

01:11.480 --> 01:12.800
<i>And when they have secrets,</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:16.280
<i>it's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before the perfect family is shattered.</i>

01:18.400 --> 01:21.240
You were the star of the party.
Did you enjoy it?

01:22.520 --> 01:24.480
I was just trying to be pleasant.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.240
Break up with Carlos tonight.
If you don't, I'll tell him everything.

01:29.800 --> 01:33.600
You helped me with Carolina
to save your marriage.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.600
-You wouldn't dare.
-Don't test me.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.120
My wife almost killed herself
because you appeared in my life.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.280
You clouded my judgment.
[inhales sharply]

01:43.360 --> 01:46.560
I was going to leave it all for you,
but you're not worth it.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.640
You destroy everything you touch.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.800
-You won't soften me up.
-[sniffles]

01:52.560 --> 01:56.120
I know this is undoubtedly one
of your great performances

01:56.200 --> 01:58.160
because there's nothing real left in you.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.080
You're a selfish fraud
who only thinks about herself.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.600
Me? I only think about myself?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.880
You have no idea! No idea!

02:06.960 --> 02:10.120
All of this, all of it,
I'm doing it for you.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.080
[Carlos] Running away
from my father's jokes?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.040
I don't blame you.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.680
I'd almost prefer to have him
annoyed with me.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
Everything okay?

02:21.720 --> 02:24.800
Yes, I've got my things.
We can leave when you like.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.760

In fact, I think I invented it.

Excuses.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.560
Excuses. I want the truth.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.920
I'm not who you think I am.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.120
-I'm not right for you.
-[scoffs]

I'm a person who destroys
everything she touches.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.160
-[clicks tongue] That isn't true.
-Yes, it is.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.720
No. No, it isn't. [chuckles]

04:43.280 --> 04:45.360

04:58.960 --> 05:02.360
-It's like Attila passed through.
-What is all this?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.000
Remember when I walked you home?

05:06.840 --> 05:11.240
Instead of going to my parents' house,
I came here.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.400
This is where I always brought my...

05:21.480 --> 05:23.800
-Conquests. [chuckles]
-...my friends.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.440
But that's not what this is about.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.480
What I wanted to say is that,

05:28.720 --> 05:31.520
that night, sitting there on the couch...

05:33.600 --> 05:35.560
I know, it isn't like me.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.160
I'm a mama's boy.
I love Ubalda's stews.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.600
But since we met, nothing's the same.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.400
Now, I think about the rotary.
I think about my father,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.200
and I even think about this place.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.360
Lidia...

05:52.280 --> 05:55.960
all I know for certain is that
you've changed me through and through,

05:56.040 --> 05:58.240
and I'm a better person now.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.440
You still think you ruin everything?

06:02.440 --> 06:04.160
[drink pouring]

06:09.000 --> 06:12.600
-Can I ask you something?
-I can't guarantee an answer.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.880
Fair enough.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.320
Who hurt you so much
to make you this distrustful?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.080
It's late. I need to go.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.680
You can sleep here.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.600
Sure, you said it,
it's late, and the bedroom is made up.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.080
I can sleep here.
I'm not trying to take advantage.

06:31.280 --> 06:36.600
But it wouldn't be a bad start to the day,
waking up beside you.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.280
-And you can leave me tomorrow.
-Yeah.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.880
You asked me once what my dreams were.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.400
I've always wanted to go to Argentina.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.560
[chuckles]

06:59.560 --> 07:03.800
I was supposed to go with a friend,
but our trip was canceled.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.520
I can take you.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.280
I've been there.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.880
Did you know they have penguins there?

07:13.320 --> 07:15.840
They're in the south,
in a place called Patagonia.

Carlota isn't here,
and I didn't know what to do.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
-I was about to call the police.
-[stutters] The police? Why?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.039
[Marga] I said that I want to be alone!

08:35.039 --> 08:38.320
Marga, Lidia is here.
She wants to talk to you.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.280
[Marga] Am I speaking Russian, Doña Lola?
I want to be alone!

08:41.360 --> 08:44.600
It's locked.
She came home in floods of tears,

08:44.680 --> 08:48.080
she took something from the kitchen
and shut herself in there.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.680
[stuttering]

08:49.760 --> 08:51.400
You heard her.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.040
[stammering] She's beside herself,

08:54.120 --> 08:57.360
and in that state, a person is capable
of the most terrible things.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.640
This is dreadful.
Such a sensible girl and now this.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.800
How can I tell her grandmother
that her darling girl has killed herself?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.120
How can I give her the news?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.720
How the hell did you open the door?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.000
[Alba] May I?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.400
You don't have to tell me,
but it must have been serious to--

09:26.480 --> 09:27.920
[Marga] Pablo has a girlfriend.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.520
[sniffles]

09:29.600 --> 09:32.960
It's my fault.
Me and my obsession with curls.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.240
First, it was the milkman's son, Lucas.
And then there was Luciano.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.320
He was like a cherub.
Blond, golden blond.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.120
They brushed me off.
Now, the one who didn't has let me down.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.920
And tomorrow, I'll see him at work,
and I don't know what to do.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.920
Do I tell him? Do I confront him?
I know what you're going to say.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.400
We're very different.
You don't meddle in other people's lives.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.720
-But I don't know what to do.
-If he's got a girlfriend, it's his loss.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.280
Tomorrow, you should tell him
that you know.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.960
And show him all that self-respect
and character you show every day

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
to Doña Lola, to the girls, to me.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.240
Doña Lola was scared. She thought
you'd taken a knife from the kitchen.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.520
-[scoffs] A knife?
-[chuckles]

10:15.600 --> 10:17.560
This is what I took.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.280
[both laugh]

10:21.000 --> 10:24.400
-Should I go find her and reassure her?
-Find her?

10:30.520 --> 10:33.360
Doña Lola, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

10:33.440 --> 10:36.720
[Alba] Don't you know eavesdropping
is a sin? At your age!

10:37.560 --> 10:40.480
It was a matter of life and death.
It doesn't count.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.400
Good morning!

Ooh, good morning!
I'm delighted to see you so... happy.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.000
The sun is shining. Life is wonderful.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.440
-And so is love.
-Indeed. What did you think of Lidia?

11:07.520 --> 11:11.960
[inhales deeply] I'll ask Ubalda
to bring you a large coffee.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.920
Your taste has improved considerably.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.480
You're like a starving man.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.760
It was a very long night, Francisco.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.240
[Carolina] Good morning, Don Francisco.
I've prepared your coffee

11:33.320 --> 11:35.920
-and got you today's paper.
-You wasted your time.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.520
You're a meddler. I don't want
people like you in the company.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.080
I've worked here for years and--

11:40.160 --> 11:43.360
I don't want excuses.
You were warned. You're fired.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.040
I want you out of here by noon.
Is that understood?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.280
I know there's something
between you and Alba.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.040
That's Lidia's real name, isn't it? Alba.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I have an ace up my sleeve,
and I'm going to use it.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.000
Take your things and go. Get out!

12:11.480 --> 12:14.720
-[Carolina] You! This is all your fault!
-I told you to stay away from me.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.280
-You lousy bitch!
-[yelps]

12:16.360 --> 12:19.440
-What?
-[Marga] No, Lidia.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.440
-[Mario] Please, ladies.
-I swear...

12:21.520 --> 12:24.720
-What is this all about?
-Now you're worried about me?

12:24.800 --> 12:28.680
-The last thing I need now is your pity.
-I'm sorry I reacted like I did.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.080
It wasn't a good time,
but I worry about you.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.400
-Mario.
-Tell me what's wrong.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.680
You chose your wife.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.720
For once, be consistent
and do what's right,

12:36.800 --> 12:39.040
and leave me alone. [sighs]

12:45.520 --> 12:48.720
[Marga] Lord,
she really does have it out for you.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.800
[Pablo] Marga. Hello.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.640
I need to talk to you, just for a minute.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.880
-[whispers] I'll go on ahead.
-No, you're not going anywhere.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.240
We have nothing to talk about.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.120

14:04.400 --> 14:06.800
You can trust us. What's going on?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.400
I'm going to leave Mario.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.600
My daughter can't grow up with him.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.080
But what will you do?

14:16.400 --> 14:18.320
You'll need a job, a place to stay.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.800
I'd lend you money,
but I don't have much.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.440
-There are job openings in Barcelona.
-Are you sure?

14:24.520 --> 14:27.440
Mario has the law on his side.
What if he reports it or finds you?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.560
I don't want to think about it.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.040
I was hoping to get help.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.840
Thank you. Thanks, Victoria.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.600
I need your photo for the ID.
You'll have it today.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.800
-When are you leaving?
-Tonight.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.760
I know it's a bit soon,
but I can't wait for him to...

14:49.840 --> 14:52.080
[sighs heavily] No matter.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.920
I'll ask Sara to let me go to the bank,
and I'll get what I need for the journey.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.320
Do you have Mario's authorization?

14:58.400 --> 15:02.760
Yes, I got it months ago.
I can withdraw money on my own.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.680
Doña María will bring Sofía
at the end of the day.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
Mm-hmm.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.480
By the time Mario gets home,
I'll be on my way to Barcelona.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.920
-It will all be okay.
-[chuckles]

15:15.000 --> 15:17.280
-You're doing the right thing.
-Mm-hmm.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.640
I just hope he doesn't find out.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
[indistinct chatter]

15:36.680 --> 15:39.120
-What's going on?
-Sara hasn't come in.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.080
What do you mean?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.800
In all the time I've worked here,
Sara has never been late.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.480
She's never even been out sick.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.080
And where's Carlota?

15:53.080 --> 15:55.280
She didn't come home last night.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.320
I thought she was with Miguel.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.000
She should be here.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.840
This woman needs a doctor.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.600
Won't you do something?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.240
[woman] Don't waste your time.

16:20.320 --> 16:24.200
Be thankful for what we have
and that we get bread and water.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.880
Why are you here?

16:27.960 --> 16:30.360
We were in the Lyceum
and there was a raid.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.320
The lecture was legal. They had no right.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.040
They have all the rights we don't have.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.040
Women are second-class beings.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.880
A few months ago,
they arrested some students

16:43.960 --> 16:46.360
who took off their hats
in the Puerta del Sol.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.000
They're still locked up here,
two cells over.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.520
If you don't have anyone
who can get you out...

16:53.320 --> 16:54.800
nothing can save you.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.120
[Carlota] I demand to know if Sara Millán
is being held in this police station.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.240
[chuckles]

17:00.320 --> 17:02.120
[Carlota] Very well, as you wish.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.560
[Miguel] Carlota!

17:04.640 --> 17:07.880
Please, let her go. We're leaving.
There'll be no more problems.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.200
Go on, move. Move.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.560
We can't do anything.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.280
Yes, we can. I'm not giving up.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
Mother!

17:25.839 --> 17:28.240
[Pilar] Carlota! My dear, how lovely!

17:28.319 --> 17:31.680
What a surprise. What are you doing here?

17:31.760 --> 17:35.720
-[Carlota] I've come to talk to Father.
-[Emilio] And to what do I owe that honor?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.160
The thing is...

17:40.520 --> 17:43.440
a friend of mine is being held
at the police station.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.960
You have contacts in the police,
so I thought you could help her

17:48.040 --> 17:51.320
because Sara can't lose her job.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.600
So that's why you came,
to ask for a favor.

17:54.680 --> 17:58.280
I came because I believe
that, under that colonel's uniform,

17:58.360 --> 18:01.280
there is a good man with a good heart.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.480
And so that you can show me
I'm not mistaken.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.480
Your friend should have been more careful.

18:06.560 --> 18:11.320
Depending on which places you frequent,
you risk being caught in a raid.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.200
How do you know it was a raid?

18:17.320 --> 18:20.280
Did you order it? [scoffs]

18:21.480 --> 18:24.400
I should have guessed.
You wanted them to arrest me.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.960
You wanted to teach me a lesson,

18:26.040 --> 18:28.840
and act like my savior
like you've done so many times before.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.480
[inhales deeply]

18:30.560 --> 18:34.640
I didn't order anything.
I'm an army officer, not a policeman.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.960
If you'd just make an effort,
it would be much easier for everyone.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.560
Behave for once in your life,
and I will be generous.

18:43.640 --> 18:49.040
Being generous would be giving something
without expecting anything in return.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.640
-So you're not going to come home?
-No.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.960
In that case, I'm afraid I won't be able
to help your friend.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.200
[Francisco] We need a supervisor
to fill in for Miss Millán immediately.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.280
At least for today.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.960
[Carlos] It's very strange
that she hasn't come in.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.560
-[Ricardo] Francisco.
-Yes.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.720
I want to speak to you alone.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.040
[Carlos] I'm part of this company, too.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.800
Whatever you talk about,
I want to hear it.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.640
Carlos, this matter doesn't concern you.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.040
The more you insist I leave,
the more I want to hear it.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.840
Carlos, your father is right.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.840
All my life, I've been told
that I'm frivolous. Fine.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.720
Now I want to get involved.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.680
Very well, stay.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.560
Miss, close the door.

19:41.040 --> 19:45.280
I'm going to tell you something
that perhaps it's time you knew.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.640
We've been listening
to certain subscribers' calls.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.400
By doing this,
we obtained benefits for the company.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.720
That explains a lot of things.

19:57.800 --> 20:01.520
[Ricardo] Miss Rodríguez de Senillosa
is helping us do it,

20:01.600 --> 20:04.640
-as is the supervisor, Sara Millán.
-[Carlota] Yes.

20:04.720 --> 20:08.520
But now Sara is in trouble
and she needs our help.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.480
Last night,
she was arrested in the Lyceum.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.480
My father arranged it
to pressure me into returning home.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.000
I escaped, but Sara's paying the price
because of me.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.120
Sara is your most loyal employee.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.800
She's been in charge
of the phone tapping from the start.

20:21.880 --> 20:26.240
[Ricardo] I don't think we can do much.
Your father is an important man.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.480
Yes, but she knows a lot
about this company.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.560
-You don't want her working against you.
-Is that a threat?

20:32.640 --> 20:35.240
-Because if it is--
-I'm not threatening anyone.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
I just want your help.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.960
I think there's a lot at stake,
for Sara and for you.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.480
Francisco...

20:43.480 --> 20:45.880
find a substitute for Sara.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.520
I'll see about getting her out of jail.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.120
And, in the meantime,
I expect one thing from all of you.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.200
Silence.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.960
[door closes]

21:07.400 --> 21:09.360
[Carlos] <i>So that's the key</i>
<i>to this business.</i>

21:09.440 --> 21:11.520
Not subscribers or technology.
Espionage.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.840
-I understand that you're confused.
-Confused? Not at all.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
I understand very well
what's going on here.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I won't say anything, but don't ask me
to keep working as normal.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.560
We're committing a crime,
and now I'm an accomplice.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.440
-It won't always be like this.
-Well, that's reassuring.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.080
Automation is the future.
You said it. It will come about.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.520
You'll have what you wanted
and we'll stop doing this.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.120
Your father is starting to trust you.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.520
In the end,
he'll let you build the prototype.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.760
You're right, as always.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.920
[sighs] I'll see you later.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.640
-Sara was arrested in the Lyceum.
-What?

21:46.720 --> 21:49.360
Yes, I was with her.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.120
She was caught.
I just managed to get away.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.800
-Is she in prison?
-My God!

21:54.880 --> 21:57.360
-Shouldn't we do something?
-No!

21:57.440 --> 22:00.840
The Cifuenteses are seeing to it,
and I'm sure Sara will be back soon.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.080
They're going to help her?

22:04.160 --> 22:07.360
Yes, I think so.
I don't know much more.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.000
[Francisco] Ladies, please.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.800
The day has started with a small problem.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.880
The supervisor, Miss Sara Millán,
is absent due to an illness.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.080
For now, one of our most experienced
employees will be taking her place.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.840
-Mrs. Vidal, you are in charge.
-Me?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.600
You have to keep an eye
on the switchboard and all the rooms.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.000
We need the weekly reports today, so--

22:27.080 --> 22:31.040
I think one of the supervisors
from the next shift should do it.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.200
You've just been promoted.
I hope it wasn't a mistake.

22:34.280 --> 22:37.680
-I need you here 100% today.
-Yes, sir.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.400
I hope this setback
doesn't affect today's work.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.680
Is that understood?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.600
Good day.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.400
Miss Aguilar, to my office.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.880
Why did you say
you were doing this for me?

22:55.960 --> 22:59.160
What does that matter?
I'm selfish, a fake.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.000
You made that very clear.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.320
And that's why you slept with Carlos?
At least now it's clear what you're up to.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.480
You came for money,
and you're staying for it.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.880
But now you're not taking it from a safe.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.160
Why bother
when you can live off the Cifuenteses?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.160
You can think that, but I'm not like you.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.400
-I didn't marry Elisa for money.
-Then why?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.920
Because you loved her?

23:21.360 --> 23:24.720
Alba, if you don't leave Carlos...

23:24.800 --> 23:27.200
-I'm capable of--
-[Carlos] What are you doing?

23:28.760 --> 23:30.360
What's going on?

23:31.560 --> 23:34.040
Nothing, it was just a misunderstanding.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.160
No, there's something you should know.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.920
You're dating a fraud
who's only after your money.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.560
-What?
-She's manipulating you.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.880
-She says she loves you, but it's a lie.
-That isn't true.

23:42.960 --> 23:45.600
-Be quiet!
-Don't shout at her!

23:45.680 --> 23:48.840
You believe her over me?
You've just met her.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.880
Haven't you been lying
for my father for years?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.760
You have no moral authority here.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.080
Are we having our first fight
in ten years over a woman?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.600
All Lidia wants is your money.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.240
I'm going to prove it.

24:05.240 --> 24:09.840
I don't know what's got into him.
The Francisco I know isn't like that.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.840
-Are you all right?
-And you?

24:14.760 --> 24:17.400
Why did you say Francisco had lied to you?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.760
I need you to do something.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.200
Get a phone terminal
and come to my office.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.720
Yes, Don Francisco.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.480
Did you see that? Some manners.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.160
-Hello, Marga.
-[Marga] <i>What do you want?</i>

24:37.240 --> 24:39.840
-To talk to you, of course.
-Yes, sure.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.520
But when you should have talked,
you didn't.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.640
-I'm sorry. That ship has sailed.
-What ship?

24:46.760 --> 24:49.560
-Wasn't that a bit much?
-No!

24:57.160 --> 24:59.120
Operator 48, how can I help you?

25:05.240 --> 25:07.520
No, she won't answer.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.200
-How many is that?
-I don't know.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.360
-I've lost count.
-Mmm.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.640
-How many?
-More than ten.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.160
-[stutters] Less than 40.
-[inhales sharply]

25:19.240 --> 25:22.760
Believe me, the best thing to do
is to stop being so persistent.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.480
If I hadn't been persistent,
I'd never have gotten anywhere.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.840
I'm seeing Marisol today.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.440
I'm going to break up with her,

25:28.520 --> 25:30.160
-and Marga has to know.
-[laughs]

25:39.720 --> 25:41.280
[Mario] Well, it's all set up.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.360
The line is connected
to the customer support telephone.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.920
You only need to lift the receiver.
I haven't connected the microphone,

25:48.000 --> 25:52.440
so Miss Aguilar won't know
that you're on the other end.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.840
[Francisco] I appreciate your efficiency,
but also your future discretion.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.400
No one can know about this.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.080
This company is continuing to grow.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.520
You were recently promoted.
You are now the only chief technician.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.920
But soon, we'll need many more,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.760
and then we'll have to name
an operations manager.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.320
If I may say so, sir,
I am the perfect man to do it.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.480
-You are dismissed.
-Of course.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.160
[sighs] You treat me too well, Ricardo.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.800
If this is about the prank,
it's already been forgotten.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.600
-The lamb last night was enough.
-[chuckles]

26:42.680 --> 26:47.520
-No, it's not about that.
-You're going to ask for something else?

26:47.600 --> 26:51.120
The supervisor who was in charge
of the phone tapping for His Majesty

26:51.200 --> 26:52.320
has been arrested.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.280
There was a raid on the Lyceum,

26:54.360 --> 26:57.080
-so if you could make a call--
-[laughing]

26:58.000 --> 26:59.200
You ask, you ask...

27:00.280 --> 27:02.160
and what will you give us in return?

27:02.240 --> 27:04.800
Your phone tapping is worthless.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.640
We don't even know anything
about the coup that's being planned.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.120
If we haven't given you information,
it's because we don't have it.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.680
-If we did--
-His Majesty is fed up.

27:13.760 --> 27:18.160
He wants answers and, without them,
there are no more favors.

27:22.480 --> 27:26.400
Does that mean you don't mind
if I reveal your little indiscretion?

27:27.920 --> 27:29.080
[chuckles]

27:29.160 --> 27:33.120
What would Cayetana think of that?
You with her sister...

27:35.000 --> 27:37.680
Talk to him, convince him.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.840
I can't.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.120
At this point, I'm more afraid
of the king than of my wife.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.880
The favors are over, Ricardo. I'm sorry.

27:53.760 --> 27:55.840
[phone ringing]

28:00.720 --> 28:02.520
[line ringing]

28:04.360 --> 28:07.960
-[Carlos] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Alba] <i>You shouldn't be calling me here.</i>

28:08.680 --> 28:12.360
<i>You're occupying a line that is</i>
<i>very important for your subscribers.</i>

28:12.440 --> 28:16.720
[Carlos] <i>This is much more urgent, Lidia.</i>
<i>I'm dying of hunger.</i>

28:17.240 --> 28:19.720
It will be lunchtime
in exactly ten minutes.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.040
I propose another improvised picnic
in the machine room.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.120
-And Miguel?
<i>-Dealing with personal matters.</i>

28:26.720 --> 28:31.320
It'll just be you, me
and our little big secret.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.520
[Alba] <i>I can't.</i>

28:32.600 --> 28:35.440
I have to run
an important errand for a friend.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.840
<i>I have to go.</i>

28:45.280 --> 28:48.720
[Alba] <i>Treachery destroys</i>
<i>even the greatest of unions.</i>

28:49.560 --> 28:51.360
<i>Feeling that someone you love,</i>

28:51.440 --> 28:54.880
<i>a friend, a lover or a son,</i>
<i>is doing something behind your back</i>

28:54.960 --> 28:58.200
<i>has only one possible outcome,</i>
<i>and it isn't a happy one.</i>

29:04.280 --> 29:08.160
<i>Trust is earned day by day,</i>
<i>but it's lost in an instant,</i>

29:08.240 --> 29:10.560
<i>like a glass of water</i>
<i>spilled on the floor.</i>

29:31.600 --> 29:33.360
What's going on here?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.600
[Francisco] It's the Rotary 7.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.880
I told him specifically
I didn't want him to go on with this.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.680
Why did I think my son had changed?

29:53.120 --> 29:56.320
Don Ricardo,
it may not just be Carlos' doing.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.600
Let me find out who else is involved.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.840
Otherwise,
we'll never get to the bottom of this.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.440
Do what you have to.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.920
Telephone Company, how can I help you?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.320
It's lunchtime.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.320
Just a moment, please.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.880
Here. It's Mario's authorization.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.560
Try to avoid Jaime Quintanilla.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.120
He's in charge of the account
and he knows me.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.880
Don't worry. It'll all go well. Okay?

30:50.960 --> 30:52.640
Don't worry.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.400
Sorry. I trust you. [sighs]

30:55.480 --> 30:56.640
I'm nervous.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.840
The king won't intercede for Sara

30:58.920 --> 31:02.720
unless we can offer him information
about the alleged coup.

31:02.800 --> 31:08.080
So if you don't have that information,
all I can say is that I'm sorry.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.880
We can't do anything.
Our hands are tied.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.280
I understand.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.720
You know that if Sara talks
about what she was doing here,

31:16.800 --> 31:17.960
it would be the end of the company?

31:18.040 --> 31:20.160
-If I talk--
-Then we'll all fall.

31:21.520 --> 31:24.080
And your threat won't change things.

31:25.040 --> 31:30.240
You two, like us,
are involved in espionage.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.360
I assure you we have proof.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.160
[Francisco] Unfortunately,
we can't do anything more for her.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.520
And if she talks,

31:38.600 --> 31:41.400
she'll have to face the consequences
like all of us.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.520
There must be something else.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.400
We've done all we can.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.280
Miguel, let's go and talk
in the machine room.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.520
Do you have bad news?

32:00.400 --> 32:02.720
I tried to get Sara freed, but...

32:04.720 --> 32:06.800
Miguel, I spoke to the Cifuenteses.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.920
Look... Sara was listening in on calls
on Don Ricardo's orders,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.480
and I helped Sara do it.

32:13.560 --> 32:17.840
I did it to stay in the company.
My father had asked them to fire me.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.080
I know it's wrong, and we have no secrets,

32:22.160 --> 32:24.640
and it's wrong to lie,
but I had no choice.

32:24.720 --> 32:28.600
It's all right.
At times, life leaves us no choice.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.440
Did the Cifuenteses do anything?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.800
[voice breaking] They used their contacts
and they tried, but...

32:37.880 --> 32:40.240
-[sighs]
-Carlota, you've done all you could.

32:40.320 --> 32:44.360
No, I haven't. I haven't done enough.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.920
I just want to see her.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.560
If you go back there, they'll arrest you.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.960
I could tell by the way the policeman
was looking at you.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.240
[crying]

32:54.320 --> 32:59.360
Miguel, what do you want me to do?
She saved me. [sniffles]

32:59.440 --> 33:04.680
She kept me from getting arrested,
and now she's locked up.

33:04.760 --> 33:08.040
And there's nothing I can do.
There's nothing I can do.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.280
[officer] Who's Sara Millán?

33:18.960 --> 33:21.960
You're in luck.
Your boyfriend has come to see you.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.560
How are you, darling?

33:46.840 --> 33:48.640
I've had better days.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.400
You're the last person
I would have expected.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.400
Carlota is worried about you,
and I'm worried about Carlota.

33:56.480 --> 34:01.040
-Did she ask you to visit me?
-No, and she didn't force me to do it.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.640
Sara, it doesn't matter
what's happened between us.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.600
What's happened to you isn't fair.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.199
Are they treating you well?

34:13.280 --> 34:14.920
Sara...

34:15.000 --> 34:17.920
Carlota and the Cifuenteses are trying
everything to get you out of here,

34:18.000 --> 34:19.080
but they've had no luck.

34:19.159 --> 34:22.760
Maybe you know someone
or know something that can help you.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.360
Sara...

34:31.080 --> 34:34.920
really think about it.
Is there anything that could help you?

34:37.760 --> 34:40.239
I'm just an operator. What could I know?

34:42.719 --> 34:44.199
[whirring]

34:46.080 --> 34:48.080
Operator, connect me to 486.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.920
Indalecio, come to my house tonight
when you leave the office.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.719
Yes, it's urgent, and yes, it's important.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.640
I want to change my will.

35:00.880 --> 35:05.200
Don Ricardo, you have a visitor, sir.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.480
You may go, Ubalda.
I'll take care of this.

35:14.240 --> 35:18.760
-How dare you come to my house?
-I only came because I had no choice.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.760
I need you to intervene on my behalf.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.120
-I want to get my job back.
-I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.400
You own the Telephone Company.
You can do anything.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.520
Even...

35:33.720 --> 35:35.920
even if it's just for old time's sake.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.480
Get out, Carolina.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.840
You're forcing me to tell your wife.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.360
Now, Carolina?

35:50.680 --> 35:53.080
-[scoffs] That was years ago.
-So what?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.880
No woman likes to know that her husband

35:56.960 --> 35:59.960
has had the bad taste
to get involved with a secretary.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.120
-How very unoriginal. Hmm?
-[Carmen] Indeed.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.880
Throughout our marriage,

36:05.960 --> 36:08.080
my husband has been
the typical unfaithful husband.

36:08.160 --> 36:12.480
So typical that he hasn't even bothered
to be discreet.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.320
I know everything, dear,
so get out of here.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.120
I understand that you choose them young,

36:24.200 --> 36:27.920
but they should at least be
a bit more... sensible.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.120
Good morning.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.400
Good morning, miss.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.200
-It's Mrs. Pérez.
-Oh.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.320
Forgive me, I didn't see a ring.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.800
I'm allergic to gold.
I had to take it off.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.880
Perhaps that's
because you have a lot of it.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.800
Forgive me.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.240
Tell me how I can help you, Mrs. Pérez.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.440
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.960
Here is my husband's permission.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.640
Just a moment.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.600
I'm afraid this authorization is invalid.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.640
What do you mean?

38:18.160 --> 38:21.120
Your husband, Don Mario,
called to cancel it yesterday.

38:23.560 --> 38:27.120
Well, I've just come from home
and my husband said nothing.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.320
I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do, ma'am.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.480
I want to speak to your supervisor.

38:33.240 --> 38:37.000
As you wish, ma'am. I'll let him know.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.760
Excuse me, Don Jaime,

38:42.840 --> 38:45.680
-Mrs. Pérez wishes to speak to you.
-Just a moment.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
[clerk] Thank you.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.840
He's coming now, ma'am.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.840
What is your supervisor's name?

38:55.920 --> 38:57.920
-Don Jaime Quintanilla, ma'am.
-That's impossible.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.960
Don Jaime isn't the supervisor.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.480
Yes, he is, ma'am, since last week.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.880
Look, I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

39:08.840 --> 39:12.320
It would be best if I go home
and come back with my husband.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.880
Thank you.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.760
Forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm so clumsy.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.000
-Let me help you.
-[clerk] That's all right.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.480
Excuse me, could I ask one more favor?

39:29.440 --> 39:31.880
Could you bring me a glass of water?

39:31.960 --> 39:34.040
-My nerves.
-Of course.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.480
<i>♪ I am the moth ♪</i>

39:38.240 --> 39:39.920
<i>♪ And you are the flame ♪</i>

39:40.720 --> 39:42.960
<i>♪ You ignite my heart ♪</i>

39:44.000 --> 39:45.840
<i>♪ And blow me away ♪</i>

39:47.200 --> 39:50.400
[Marisol] Look at what the pollution
is doing to my eyes.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.960
I don't know how you've spent a year here.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.640
Marisol... [clears throat]
there's a matter--

39:55.720 --> 39:58.040
One thing. After we're married,

39:58.120 --> 40:01.280
we can stay here for two years
to save up, right?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.520
But then, we're heading home.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.480
Ah, the wedding
has a lot to do with what I...

40:07.560 --> 40:08.880
What is it?

40:10.440 --> 40:12.160
Do you want to talk about dates?

40:12.240 --> 40:14.880
Is that it? I'm so happy!

40:14.960 --> 40:17.560
Every time I bring it up,
you get slippery as an eel.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.840
Go on, tell me.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.960
Pablo, just spit it out!

40:27.560 --> 40:28.880
I'm going to the washroom.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.000
Good day. Two fingers of gin, please.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.520
Marisol, come on, don't cry.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.360
Men are terrible, really.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.920
It seems like the end of the world,
but it's not.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.240
-There are other fish in the sea.
-[stutters] Excuse me?

40:54.320 --> 40:57.320
Your relationship was going nowhere.
It had no future.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.600
Pablo wanted to break it off,
but he didn't dare do it.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.120
You have to keep your spirits up.
Go out in the city.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.880
Madrid is full of boys
who'd want to court you.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.160
-Pablo!
-[Pablo] Don Mario!

41:13.200 --> 41:14.200
[grunts]

41:14.280 --> 41:16.240
-Darling!
-Don't "darling" me!

41:16.320 --> 41:18.040
Don't "darling" me!

41:18.120 --> 41:21.760
So you want to leave me, hmm?
You want to leave me?

41:21.840 --> 41:24.040
Yes, that's what I want.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.120
Well, no. I'm leaving you!

41:29.200 --> 41:30.400
I'm leaving you!

41:36.760 --> 41:38.840
Hadn't you left her already?

41:40.760 --> 41:42.360
[exclaims]

41:42.440 --> 41:45.800
It's done! It's done! It's done!

41:45.880 --> 41:49.160
If you want to hug a man,
wait until your father is on his deathbed.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.680
It's done. I have to tell Marga right now.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.680
Marga, we have to talk. Hello. Marga!

41:57.760 --> 42:00.600
-What's going on?
-I've left Marisol. It's done, I'm free.

42:00.680 --> 42:04.000
-Too late, and maybe you're lying.
-No, I'm not. Why would I lie?

42:04.080 --> 42:07.240
You didn't say you had a girlfriend
while you were flirting with me.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.240
I made a mistake,
but everyone makes mistakes.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.360
[grunts]

42:13.440 --> 42:14.480
-Break it.
-Why would--

42:14.560 --> 42:16.520
Break it!

42:16.600 --> 42:18.040
-Here.
-Thank you.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.680
-See this?
-Yes.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.920
Can you do anything to fix it?

42:21.000 --> 42:22.720
-No.
-It's the same with my trust.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.680
You've lied to me, Marga. Operator 57.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.520
You see! You see!

42:27.600 --> 42:30.600
We've been lying since we met.
This relationship is going nowhere.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.280
No. Marga!

-What do you think?
-[Marga and Ángeles gasp]

43:17.200 --> 43:18.600

43:20.720 --> 43:21.920
Good.

-This is for the papers.
-[Alba] No.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.680
-Yes, Lidia.
-No, you need it more, Ángeles.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.720
Will you have enough?

43:34.640 --> 43:39.040
Yes, at least while I get
my life in order. [sighs]

43:40.880 --> 43:43.600
-Thank you.
-It was Lidia who did everything.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.480
[Ángeles] Thank you, all of you.

43:46.520 --> 43:50.360
Thanks to you,
I was able to make the decision

43:50.440 --> 43:53.280
to leave Mario and start over again.

43:54.280 --> 43:57.720
Are you going to get sentimental?
Because my day has been--

43:57.800 --> 43:58.920
[bell ringing]

43:59.000 --> 44:01.840
-Let's go!
-Thank you. [chuckles]

44:04.760 --> 44:06.560
[whispers] Marga.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.080
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.840
[chuckles] Well, actually, I was...

44:16.920 --> 44:19.000
remembering our kiss.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.720
This was our place.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.920
It was, yes. Past tense.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.560
What did you hear?

44:27.400 --> 44:29.920
Everything. Everything.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.240
If you're talking about Ángeles' plan,
I think it's madness.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.880
Leaving her husband, moving.
Imagine the look on his face.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.640
-Don't you dare say anything to Mario.
-No.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.200
Marga, I won't.

44:39.280 --> 44:41.520
It's his wife who should talk to him.
That's what I say.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.800
What kind of wife
does that to her husband?

44:43.880 --> 44:44.960
One who is abused.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.880
-What?
-Mario is an animal.

44:51.720 --> 44:54.080
Do you think Ángeles
would leave him for no reason?

44:55.840 --> 44:57.880
-Mario...
-She's leaving so she can survive.

44:57.960 --> 45:00.600
He's got a temper,
but I never imagined that--

45:00.680 --> 45:03.160
It's very important
that you keep our secret.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.280
Marga, Don Mario is like my...

45:07.360 --> 45:08.800
And he works...

45:08.880 --> 45:11.840
He's going to find out.
I can't keep a secret.

45:14.400 --> 45:18.320
Today, Mario has to work late,
and that's our opportunity.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.720
So, if you still have feelings for me...

45:20.800 --> 45:23.640
No, not even that. Just a little respect,

45:24.760 --> 45:26.200
don't say anything.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.600
Darling! I'm glad you haven't left yet.
I can go with you.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.080
[Ángeles stutters] Mario, I thought
you were going to work late.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.600
I was, but luckily your husband
is a fast, efficient worker.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.840
Let's go.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.320
Don Mario!
[chuckles nervously] I'm sorry...

45:56.400 --> 45:59.520
I was looking at your budgets
and there's...

45:59.600 --> 46:01.960
Some of the figures don't add up.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.800
-Yes, they do. I did it myself.
-No, something is wrong.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.760
Wrong?
I can't leave you for even ten minutes.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.440
I'll have to stay on.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.920
I love you.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.600
I'll see you at home.

46:18.240 --> 46:19.640
Ángeles!

46:23.320 --> 46:24.720
See you later.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.480
[sighs] He wanted us to go home together.

46:45.560 --> 46:49.560
He said that he'd finished early.
Thank heavens Pablo came.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.840
Pablo?

46:50.920 --> 46:56.480
He asked him for help with a budget,
and Mario had no choice but to stay.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.880
Pablo saved me.

47:00.960 --> 47:05.320
[sighs] Well, I think it's time now.

47:05.400 --> 47:09.440
I wanted to say something, but now...
[chuckles] I'm not able to.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.200
I'm really scared, girls.

47:14.600 --> 47:19.080
I never thought that my life
was going to be like this...

47:19.160 --> 47:22.320
Running away to another city,
with another identity.

47:22.400 --> 47:24.400
It's so strange.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.480
Sometimes there's no option.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.040
[chuckles] You know?

47:31.840 --> 47:34.240
I was working here all this time...

47:35.160 --> 47:38.000
and I'd never made any friends.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.600
I'm so thankful
you arrived late that first day.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.680
I guess it was our destiny to meet.

47:48.480 --> 47:51.600
-And now you're my family.
-[Marga] And mine.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.080
Well, the one I have here.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.480
Thank you.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.800
[Marga] Go on, get moving
or you'll miss the train.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.120
[Ángeles] Yes.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.280
[car door closes]

48:24.520 --> 48:25.920
And now what?

48:27.600 --> 48:29.440
We go on with our lives.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.240
But it will never be the same.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.240
Pablo, wait!

48:42.880 --> 48:45.640
Ángeles told me what happened.
Did you do it on purpose?

48:45.720 --> 48:48.840
Yes, because everyone
deserves a second chance.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.680
[stutters] And that's it? You're going?

48:51.760 --> 48:54.040
What do you want me to do?
I respect your decision.

48:54.120 --> 48:57.440
You don't want to be with me.
You don't trust me. I understand.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.800
I should have left Marisol long ago
and told the truth,

48:59.880 --> 49:02.600
but I couldn't do it,
because I'm a coward and...

49:09.440 --> 49:11.080
And a rambler.

Before you do that,
I want to ask for two things.

49:31.840 --> 49:34.800
I don't want the reasons
for Sara's release to be known,

49:34.880 --> 49:37.480
and I'd like to be able
to say goodbye tonight.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.760
Very well.

49:42.120 --> 49:47.800

LODGINGS

51:04.040 --> 51:07.160
-Good evening.
-Hello. I don't know you.

51:07.240 --> 51:09.080
That's because you've never come here.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.080
No, I've come to ask about a girl.

51:11.160 --> 51:14.880
Of course, handsome.
I've got all the girls you could want,

51:14.960 --> 51:16.120
if you can pay for them.

51:16.760 --> 51:21.000
Well, I've been looking for ages
for someone called Alba Romero.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.440
I was told she's been seen in this house.

51:23.520 --> 51:27.040
I've never heard that name.
I'm sorry, young man.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.720
Thank you for Ángeles' papers.
I'll pay you back soon.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.560
There's no hurry, love.
Don't worry about that now.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.880
Just be happy
that you could save Ángeles.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.920
Victoria, I've been thinking a lot.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.920
About the rotary
and all that I'm doing because of Beltrán,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.120
the damn photos.

51:59.200 --> 52:02.960
Are you going to take my advice
and forget about all of it?

52:05.360 --> 52:06.560
Why?

52:07.560 --> 52:10.760
-What's happened?
-There's something I haven't told you.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.680
[Victoria] I'll be right back.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.640
-Please leave.
-I see that you remember me.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.120
-I'm not leaving without an explanation.
-Didn't you hear me?

52:23.200 --> 52:26.040
-I said go away.
-Not this time.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.520
[Alba] What are you doing here?

52:29.680 --> 52:30.840
Ask her.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.840
I was here years ago,
asking for Alba Romero,

52:33.920 --> 52:35.680
and you told me you'd never heard of her.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.160
-I don't know what you mean.
-You don't?

52:39.920 --> 52:42.920
I went to all the boardinghouses
in Madrid, all the hospitals.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.720
I went back to the station
a thousand times.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.800
Just when I didn't know what to do,
I got a tip.

52:46.880 --> 52:47.880
Someone saw you here.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.000
Is that true?

52:55.680 --> 52:57.480
We had a chance, Alba.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.520
And she ruined it.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.640
You separated us
and made her what she is now.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.080
[chuckling] I see how much you love her.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.240
[Francisco] I loved Alba.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.160
You turned her into a liar, a thief.
Lidia isn't Alba.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.760
You're certainly right about that.

53:12.840 --> 53:14.760
I saw the potential in that village girl.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.800
I turned her into
an independent, powerful woman

53:17.880 --> 53:20.080
who can get what she wants.
Don't you see?

53:20.640 --> 53:22.680
How generous! You ruined her--

53:22.760 --> 53:26.280
Stop it!
I don't want to hear another word.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.440
Forget about me, both of you.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.880
-[inhales sharply]
-Drop it.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.880
Let her go.

53:46.760 --> 53:51.160
Lidia is protecting you.
Everything she's doing is for you.

53:52.680 --> 53:53.880
What?

53:53.960 --> 53:56.760
She's stayed in the company

53:56.840 --> 54:00.240
and gotten close to the owner's son
for you.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.600
[sighs heavily]

54:03.680 --> 54:07.880
You were photographed kissing
when you met at the train station.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.240
Alba is doing all she can to ensure
those photos are never seen.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.280
She's doing it all for you.

54:22.880 --> 54:26.120
Thank you for the bath and the drink.
I needed it.

54:26.200 --> 54:28.080
[Miguel] We all needed it.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.880

I was thinking of what
you must have gone through in jail,

54:42.880 --> 54:43.880
and...

54:44.640 --> 54:47.360
I went through that, too, at home.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.760
[Miguel] Carlota, forget it.
You're not going back.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.920
[Sara] What matters is now.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.840
And now we're happy.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.520
It's a beautiful night. We've got drinks,
and we're in the best company there is.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.880
Here's to now!

55:02.920 --> 55:04.360
Here's to now!

55:08.600 --> 55:10.320
We have to enjoy the moment.

not as you would like them to be.
You have to accept that.

57:25.560 --> 57:28.640
And just when I was thinking
I was wrong about you,

57:28.720 --> 57:30.840
I find Francisco in front of the rotary!

57:32.160 --> 57:34.880
Now you can imagine
why I called the lawyer!

57:34.960 --> 57:37.640
Someday, you'll admit you're mistaken.
That machine is the future.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.840
And so you can lie to me,
steal from the company?

57:40.920 --> 57:41.960
Look who's talking.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.960
You use your company
to spy on your clients.

57:44.040 --> 57:48.400
That paid for the house you live in
and the school where you were educated.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.480
Educating your children
means giving them values.

57:50.560 --> 57:54.560
I lie, but to strangers
and always to protect my family.

57:54.640 --> 57:59.160
Why do you think I hid it from you?
I did it to protect you.

57:59.240 --> 58:02.760
If what we do ever becomes public,
it would be a disaster!

58:02.840 --> 58:06.080
I would prefer for it to harm Francisco
rather than my own son!

58:06.160 --> 58:07.600
I doubt that very much!

58:09.560 --> 58:11.520
You've never wanted me as an heir.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.480
I've never been the son you wanted.

58:14.560 --> 58:16.800
I never lived up to your expectations.

58:17.880 --> 58:20.440
I'm sick of you demanding
that I be a perfect son.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.960
What right do you have?
You've never been a good father.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.800
I hate you! You hear me? I hate you!
