00:20.790 --> 00:21.790
So...

00:21.830 --> 00:23.710
a cruise ship is docking in town today.

00:23.735 --> 00:25.131
Who wants to hit the pier after school

00:25.156 --> 00:26.813
and play a little sunburn bingo?

00:26.838 --> 00:29.146
-What's sunburn bingo?
-We look at the cruise ship people

00:29.170 --> 00:30.870
on the beach and the first
one to spot all five kinds

00:30.895 --> 00:32.354
of funny sunburns wins.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.605
Flip-flop feet, sunscreen
hand-print on your back...

00:34.645 --> 00:37.155
Left your glasses on,
strap attack and upper butt.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.720
I'm in. Tina?

00:38.745 --> 00:41.325
Um, maybe. Hey, Jimmy
Jr., do you want to go?

00:41.350 --> 00:44.995
- Uh, that sounds kind of...
- Like a hot date?

00:45.020 --> 00:47.060
- Get it?
- Uh... uh...

00:47.085 --> 00:49.295
I get it! I like funny
sunburns. Count me in.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.140
Oh, okay. Uh, yeah, then me, too. Yeah.

00:52.165 --> 00:54.255
Huh, Jimmy Jr. and Zeke. Great.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.000
- Come here, J-Ju! Come on.
- Zeke.

00:56.030 --> 00:58.450
- Zeke. Zeke!
- Okay, okay.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.194
Wait, wait, Zeke,
what are you doing up there?

01:00.219 --> 01:00.846
Wait. Oh, okay.

01:00.870 --> 01:02.676
I'm coming at you from
the top rope! Here I go!

01:02.700 --> 01:05.000
- Wait, Zeke, don't.
- Zeke, get down from that table.

01:05.025 --> 01:06.975
- Brace yourself, J-Ju! Here I go!
- Zeke, stop.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.265
Zeke! Ow! My penis!

01:09.355 --> 01:12.725
That does it, Zeke.
Detention, after school today.

01:12.750 --> 01:16.315
- Aw, dag.
- M-Mr. Frond, give me detention, too.

01:16.340 --> 01:19.655
No. Go ask the lunch lady
for some ice for your penis.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.704
I guess we'll have to play
sunburn bingo without you, Zeke.

01:21.729 --> 01:24.170
Well, think of me while you're
sunburn-shaming the tourists.

01:24.195 --> 01:26.075
Maybe. We might. Might not, though.

01:26.100 --> 01:27.456
- I will!
- But we won't.

01:28.063 --> 01:29.415
Hello, Bob and Linda.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.110
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, Randy.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.770
What can I get you, a burger?

01:32.795 --> 01:34.715
Oh, thank you, Linda.
I've already eaten,

01:34.740 --> 01:36.126
and I'm a vegetarian. Meat is murder.

01:36.150 --> 01:38.085
But you can get me this.

01:38.110 --> 01:40.095
- Uh, what?
- A hug?

01:40.120 --> 01:41.160
The restaurant.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.305
You want to buy it?

01:42.330 --> 01:44.080
God, no. I want to rent it out

01:44.105 --> 01:47.095
to shoot my independent
short feature film here.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.370
- Exciting.
- It is!

01:49.395 --> 01:52.025
My film is about a man
looking back on his life.

01:52.095 --> 01:54.355
It's called A Life Well Steved.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.420
I play Steve.

01:55.470 --> 01:56.890
- I love it.
- Hmm.

01:57.035 --> 01:59.905
And this place is even better
than my original location,

01:59.930 --> 02:01.446
which fell through when it burned down.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.630
Maybe because I overloaded
the circuits with my lighting.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.075
- Maybe not.
- Uh, what?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.060
-And I'll need to shoot it tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.035
Sorry, Randy, but tomorrow's Saturday,

02:09.060 --> 02:11.520
and it's usually our busiest
day of the week. I...

02:11.545 --> 02:13.741
I don't think you can afford
to pay us enough to close...

02:13.780 --> 02:15.620
- Oh, you can.
- Mm-hmm.

02:15.650 --> 02:18.180
H-How do you... Oh, right.
You're a trust fund kid.

02:18.205 --> 02:20.545
We prefer the term "lucky baby duckies."

02:20.570 --> 02:22.885
Ooh, we'll have a
whole film crew in here.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.580
The lighting guy will be over there,

02:24.605 --> 02:26.485
and the "cinnamon-tographer"
will be over there.

02:26.510 --> 02:27.696
Nope. It'll just be me.

02:27.721 --> 02:29.595
I am my own "cinnamon-tographer."

02:29.620 --> 02:32.765
I'm also the writer,
director, producer and star.

02:32.790 --> 02:34.210
And makeup artist and on-set tutor.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.985
- I'm tingling!
- Uh, well...

02:36.010 --> 02:37.930
Come on, Bob. You love movies.

02:37.955 --> 02:40.105
- This will be fun.
- Yeah. Maybe it'll be fun.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.220
I mean, probably not, but let's do it.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.785
- Great!
- All right.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.690
I'll bring some of my
gear over in a little bit.

02:45.715 --> 02:46.845
See you guys later.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.115
Our restaurant's gonna be famous.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.730
Just like the restaurant in Seinfeld.

02:49.755 --> 02:51.188
"More soup for you."

02:52.718 --> 02:55.348
I still only have upper
butt and strap attack.

02:55.373 --> 02:58.280
Did these cruise people
finally discover sunscreen?

02:58.305 --> 02:59.795
This is nice, huh, Jimmy Jr.?

02:59.820 --> 03:01.990
- You, me, the kids.
- Look!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.015
Zeke's here. Zeke!

03:03.120 --> 03:05.255
- Damn it.
- Come stand next to me.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.080
- Tina, move over a little.
- So, closer?

03:07.105 --> 03:08.475
- No.
- Like this?

03:08.500 --> 03:10.410
No. Take, like, two steps that way.

03:10.435 --> 03:12.579
-Oh.
-Wait, why do you look so sad, Zeke?

03:12.630 --> 03:14.010
I got problems.

03:14.035 --> 03:15.761
My dad got mad at me
about getting detention.

03:15.786 --> 03:17.645
Well, he should be used to it by now.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.010
No, this time it's serious.

03:19.035 --> 03:20.655
He said if I get one more detention,

03:20.680 --> 03:22.945
he's sending me to a
special school an hour away

03:22.970 --> 03:25.330
for kids who need guidance
with disciplinary issues.

03:25.355 --> 03:26.655
An hour away?

03:26.680 --> 03:27.810
- Oh, no.
- Sorry, Zeke.

03:27.835 --> 03:29.625
That's really far.

03:29.650 --> 03:31.995
Yeah, damn. Well, we'll just
have to make the best of it,

03:32.020 --> 03:33.940
Jimmy Jr. We'll hang out all week

03:33.965 --> 03:35.691
and then, uh, maybe see
Zeke on the weekends.

03:35.730 --> 03:37.050
You can call them the "Zeke-ends."

03:37.075 --> 03:38.940
W-We can work on your issues, Zeke.

03:38.965 --> 03:41.755
- W-We can't let this happen!
- It already happened.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.070
- Wait, what do you mean?
- When I was in detention,

03:44.095 --> 03:45.925
Mr. Frond left me alone
for a little while,

03:45.950 --> 03:47.426
and I spelled a bad word on the ceiling

03:47.450 --> 03:49.015
by whipping wet toilet paper up there.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.015
He's gonna see it on Monday.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.556
Why, Zeke? Why would you do that?

03:52.580 --> 03:53.830
I don't know! I was...

03:53.880 --> 03:55.300
I was frustrated, I guess.

03:55.325 --> 03:56.935
Where did you get the toilet paper?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.329
I always carry a roll for
emergency pranks and poops.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.265
- Smart.
- What bad word did you spell?

04:01.290 --> 04:03.370
Basically every bad
word strung together.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.985
-Whoa.
-How did you decide which word went first?

04:06.010 --> 04:08.470
- Sound.
- This is the worst thing ever.

04:08.495 --> 04:10.500
I can't only see you on the Zeke-ends.

04:10.525 --> 04:12.115
That's not enough Zeke for me.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.100
- Wh-Who will I eat lunch with?
- Me.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.856
- Who will I wrestle with?
- Me.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.204
Who's gonna explain
cootie catchers to me?

04:18.230 --> 04:19.899
Me. I mean, I kind of get them.

04:19.925 --> 04:21.214
What are we gonna do?!

04:21.240 --> 04:23.870
Well, I mean, if I
was in this situation,

04:23.895 --> 04:25.425
I'd just sneak into the school tomorrow

04:25.450 --> 04:27.660
and take the toilet paper
bad word off the ceiling

04:27.685 --> 04:29.465
before anyone sees it. But that's me.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.946
Maybe you guys don't want
to walk on the wild side.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.210
- No, no, we do want to.
- Yeah, I'll do anything.

04:34.235 --> 04:35.555
But how would we get in?

04:35.580 --> 04:37.145
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- Yeah.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.920
Well, I've been working on
a prank for when I graduate.

04:39.945 --> 04:42.495
It involves a lot of crickets,
but that's a whole other story.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.080
-Tell me at bedtime.
-I haven't worked the prank out entirely,

04:45.105 --> 04:47.655
but I have figured out
how to get in the school.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.420
The gym has a window
about eight feet high

04:50.445 --> 04:52.115
that's always cracked a little.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.060
We could push a dumpster
over by the window,

04:54.085 --> 04:55.745
climb up and pull it open.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.035
It only opens wide enough

04:57.060 --> 04:58.770
to slip a very small person inside.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.335
Or a million crickets.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.650
What about you?

05:01.675 --> 05:03.965
Flattered, but no. Smaller than me.

05:03.990 --> 05:05.950
I was thinking Pocket Sized Rudy.

05:06.030 --> 05:07.990
He goes through the window,
opens the door for us,

05:08.015 --> 05:09.305
bing, bang, boom.

05:09.330 --> 05:12.410
Ooh, Pocket Sized Rudy is
in Colonial Williamsburg.

05:12.435 --> 05:15.170
Again? God, that family
loves candle making.

05:15.195 --> 05:17.266
Well, there's got to be other
small kids at our school.

05:17.290 --> 05:19.540
There is this kid in
my class, Arnold Evans.

05:19.589 --> 05:20.605
He's a really
smart eight-year-old

05:20.630 --> 05:21.981
who skipped a grade.

05:22.006 --> 05:24.550
That kid who wears a karate
outfit to school sometimes?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.235
Or what I think is a karate outfit?

05:26.260 --> 05:28.661
- I don't really get fashion.
- Yeah, that's him.

05:28.686 --> 05:31.141
I bet he could fit through
that window. What do you think?

05:31.180 --> 05:32.528
-Let's do it.
-Hell yeah! -I'm in.

05:32.553 --> 05:35.390
But maybe not, because breaking
into the school is wrong.

05:35.415 --> 05:36.915
Let's think about that for a second.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.166
Thought about it. We're doing it.

05:38.191 --> 05:40.110
Look at y'all, helping old Zeke out.

05:40.135 --> 05:41.296
Sense of community and whatnot.

05:41.335 --> 05:43.190
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

05:43.215 --> 05:45.215
- I hope not.
- Room for one more?

05:46.950 --> 05:49.345
Great. Okay, Belcher kid meeting.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.750
Arnold said he's in as long
as we call him "sensei."

05:51.775 --> 05:54.425
I said no. He said he's still
wearing his karate outfit.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.000
- I said fine.
- Great.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.040
But now we got to figure out

05:57.080 --> 05:58.360
what we're gonna tell Mom and Dad

05:58.385 --> 06:00.185
about why we can't work tomorrow. Ugh.

06:00.210 --> 06:03.145
Easy. We tell them we're doing
something stupid and helpful,

06:03.170 --> 06:04.786
like cleaning up the beach.

06:04.811 --> 06:06.691
Oh, perfect. Follow my lead.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.170
Hey, kids.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.065
Mom, Dad, we've got some big news

06:10.090 --> 06:11.446
that we think you're
gonna be excited about.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.680
Wait, what's all this?

06:12.760 --> 06:14.821
Oh, Randy's shooting
a movie here tomorrow.

06:14.846 --> 06:17.100
So we're closing. You
guys have the day off.

06:17.140 --> 06:19.390
- Oh, cool.
- Wh-What's the big news, Louise?

06:19.423 --> 06:21.698
Um, that we love you guys.

06:21.730 --> 06:24.070
- In spite of everything.
- Aw.

06:24.095 --> 06:26.440
Belcher kid meeting. Okay,
that first Belcher kid meeting

06:26.465 --> 06:27.875
was unnecessary. We're good.

06:27.931 --> 06:31.431
-Operation help Zeke is a go.
-Yay! -Yay.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.765
Okay, Arnold should be here any minute.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.080
In the meantime, Zeke,

06:39.105 --> 06:40.615
go ahead and wrestle that window open.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.330
Get open. Come on.

06:42.355 --> 06:44.065
- Loosen up. You son of a...
- Hi, guys. -Hi.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.210
- Arnold.
- Hi, buddy. - Sup?

06:45.340 --> 06:47.065
Ready to slide through
this window, Arnold?

06:47.090 --> 06:49.010
Look, I know I'm here
because I'm height-impaired

06:49.035 --> 06:51.865
and, uh, size-challenged and, uh...

06:51.890 --> 06:53.430
- Small?
- Eh, uh...

06:53.455 --> 06:56.495
Really don't like that
word too much. Uh...

06:56.520 --> 06:58.100
You should know that
I have many talents,

06:58.125 --> 06:59.665
uh, that can be of service.

06:59.690 --> 07:02.070
For instance, my skills.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.795
How about that?

07:04.820 --> 07:07.580
It looks very much like
you're about to do the robot.

07:07.605 --> 07:10.030
That'll, uh, come in handy, for sure.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.675
But first, how about
you slip in the window

07:11.700 --> 07:12.950
and open the door for us?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.886
Guys, I think we're
pressuring Arnold too much.

07:14.910 --> 07:16.216
He doesn't have to do
this if he doesn't want to.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.225
No, I want to. The karate code says

07:18.250 --> 07:19.970
- you must help people in need.
- Damn.

07:19.995 --> 07:21.765
Preesh. Now get up here. Come on.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.106
I mean, it doesn't say that verbatim,

07:23.130 --> 07:24.720
but, uh, it's implied.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.050
- Great.
- Wha...

07:26.075 --> 07:27.785
Oh, God. It's a long drop.

07:29.392 --> 07:32.594
Arnold? Buddy? You okay?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.390
- Does this look okay?
- Let's do this!

07:35.430 --> 07:37.117
Oops. I forgot to prop the door open.

07:37.142 --> 07:38.312
One more time?

07:39.600 --> 07:40.995
Okay, lets get shooting.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.770
So, you do the whole
thing into the camera?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.126
Like you're, like you're talking to it

07:44.150 --> 07:45.746
- like it's a person?
- That's right, Linda.

07:45.771 --> 07:48.085
Steve delivers his
monologue to the camera,

07:48.110 --> 07:50.805
reflecting on flashback
scenes that I already shot.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.086
Now shush, Bob. We're about to roll.

07:52.110 --> 07:53.110
I-I didn't say any...

07:53.135 --> 07:55.055
- Bob, shush.
- Okay. All right.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.322
And... action.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.530
Looking back on my life, it's funny.

08:01.555 --> 08:03.845
The things I did that made people happy.

08:03.925 --> 08:06.015
The things I did that made people sad.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.645
The whole time, I had no
idea what an impact I had.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.830
Whether it was reading to Grandpa

08:11.855 --> 08:13.025
when he was in the home

08:13.050 --> 08:15.405
or seeing a stranger on a windy day

08:15.430 --> 08:17.430
and offering them my comb.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.600
- Wait, does this all rhyme?
- Shh!

08:19.625 --> 08:21.017
And cut. Did you say something, Bob?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.980
No. Actually, Linda was saying something

08:23.005 --> 08:24.455
about how everything rhymed

08:24.480 --> 08:26.650
- and if that was weird.
- Nuh-uh.

08:26.675 --> 08:28.245
We're in. Hard part's over.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.110
Should be smooth sailing now.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.085
My penis!

08:32.110 --> 08:34.846
What the hell? Why are the
hallways all slippy-slidey?

08:35.240 --> 08:37.676
Shh! Look, Mr. Branca's waxing the floors.

08:37.707 --> 08:39.852
Oh, no, we're busted.

08:39.876 --> 08:42.000
Oh, good, he's waxing away from us.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.539
Everyone take off your shoes.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.815
If we don't scuff his floors,
he won't know we're here.

08:46.935 --> 08:48.515
♪ Summer breeze ♪

08:48.540 --> 08:50.800
♪ Makes me feel fine ♪

08:50.825 --> 08:52.735
♪ Blowing through the jasmine... ♪

08:53.096 --> 08:54.655
Detention room's this way, J-Ju.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.220
I know, I'm just grabbing
this to knock the bad word

08:57.245 --> 08:58.825
off the ceiling in the suspension room.

08:58.850 --> 09:00.220
My main man's bright.

09:00.245 --> 09:02.810
I mean, not book smart, but broom smart.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.270
And you know what

09:04.350 --> 09:05.892
was the big game changer?

09:05.917 --> 09:09.650
When I decided to never
again use the word "stranger."

09:09.770 --> 09:11.256
- He's still rhyming.
- And cut.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.950
Bob, why don't you stand in the kitchen

09:12.975 --> 09:14.371
so I won't pick you up on the audio.

09:14.505 --> 09:16.635
- Fine.
- I'm so sorry, Randy.

09:16.660 --> 09:19.170
-I can still hear you breathing, Bob!
-Oh, uh,

09:19.195 --> 09:20.655
go in the employee bathroom, Bob.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.215
- Perfect.
- No.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.520
I'm not standing in the bathroom

09:23.580 --> 09:25.320
- while you shoot the movie.
- Come on, Bob.

09:25.345 --> 09:26.765
I thought this might be fun,

09:26.790 --> 09:28.570
but I'm annoyed that
I have to stand in here

09:28.595 --> 09:30.685
- while you're shooting.
- You're annoyed?

09:30.710 --> 09:32.550
- You're annoying.
- You are!

09:32.630 --> 09:34.090
- You are!
- You are!

09:34.130 --> 09:36.723
Ooh, behind-the-scenes
movie drama.

09:36.748 --> 09:39.010
I bet this was what it
was like on the set of E.T.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.770
Spielberg and E.T. just going at it.

09:42.770 --> 09:45.490
- There it is.
- Whoa.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.125
That really is every
swear word put together.

09:48.150 --> 09:49.740
I'm impressed, Zeke.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.915
Guys, I'm not sure how
we're gonna get that down.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.070
I had my great broom
idea, but I don't...

09:54.095 --> 09:55.805
I don't think it's long enough to reach.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.290
Let me see.

09:57.450 --> 10:00.850
Poop. I guess this is a real
mission impossible, right? Poop!

10:00.875 --> 10:03.556
Wait, what if I get on that desk
and J-Ju gets on my shoulders?

10:03.580 --> 10:05.750
- I bet it would reach.
- That's so smart, Zeke.

10:05.775 --> 10:07.056
Let's do it. Come on.
Come on, get up here.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.620
- Okay, uh...
- Come on. Ooh, wow.

10:08.645 --> 10:11.435
- You losing weight, J-Ju?
- A-a little.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.790
Come on!

10:13.815 --> 10:16.195
- Ow. Still not close enough.
- Come on!

10:16.220 --> 10:18.180
Push!

10:18.205 --> 10:19.865
- Aah!
- Well, it's a start.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.115
Yeah, but at this rate,
we'll be here all day.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.640
As long as we're done by 4:00.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.035
There's a Facts of Life marathon,

10:25.060 --> 10:27.480
and, honey, I've been training for it.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.480
And I thought to myself, "I
can't take another hurdle.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.829
I think I am that baby turtle."

10:33.298 --> 10:35.454
And... cut.

10:35.479 --> 10:37.545
Oh, Randy, that was beautiful.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.610
- Oh, you think so?
- Oh, yeah, it was perfect.

10:39.635 --> 10:41.345
- It wasn't too on the nose?
- No.

10:41.370 --> 10:43.060
Thanks. That means a lot.

10:43.085 --> 10:44.715
How long have you been finished?

10:44.740 --> 10:46.886
Were you ever gonna tell me
when to leave the bathroom?

10:46.910 --> 10:48.540
Oh, relax, Bob. We just cut.

10:48.620 --> 10:50.055
You're free to stay out here

10:50.080 --> 10:51.516
while I rehearse the
turn in my monologue.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.330
Wow, thank you.

10:53.355 --> 10:56.025
You think
I wanted to end up here?

10:56.050 --> 10:57.840
In a depressing place like this?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.010
- Day after day?
- What? Wait.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.316
I thought this was about a guy

11:01.340 --> 11:03.090
happily looking back on his life.

11:03.115 --> 11:05.325
And by the way, Randy, what
happened to the rhyming?

11:05.350 --> 11:06.996
First of all, I don't know
what you're talking about

11:07.020 --> 11:08.810
with the rhyming. Second, I did some

11:08.835 --> 11:10.396
last-minute rewrites this morning.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.190
The whole thing was just too... neat.

11:12.215 --> 11:13.845
It needed a dark turn.

11:13.870 --> 11:15.955
Is it still called A Life Well Steved?

11:15.980 --> 11:17.965
It is, but I added some commas.

11:17.990 --> 11:21.000
So now it's A Life, Well, Steved.

11:21.025 --> 11:23.373
Like he had good intentions,
then he "Steved" it up.

11:23.398 --> 11:25.175
Oh, I get it.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.636
You didn't say you were gonna
make the restaurant sound

11:26.660 --> 11:28.120
- like a depressing...
- Stink hole?

11:28.145 --> 11:30.500
- No. I didn't say that.
- Well, I'm gonna use it.

11:30.525 --> 11:32.830
Y-You can't call my
restaurant a stink hole.

11:32.855 --> 11:34.289
- Did you cash the check?
- Yes.

11:34.314 --> 11:35.620
- I'm saying stink hole.
- Damn it!

11:40.050 --> 11:41.930
Ugh. It looks like we only got

11:41.955 --> 11:43.325
about a quarter of it down.

11:43.350 --> 11:45.430
I-I can still make
out a few swear words.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.010
Yeah. And they're the worst ones.

11:47.035 --> 11:49.165
- Even I'm offended by that one.
- H'yah!

11:50.211 --> 11:52.980
Well, gang... call the
people who clean up stadiums,

11:53.020 --> 11:54.980
because we left it all on the field.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.490
- We tried our best. Darn.
- Wait, wait.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.440
I saw a ladder in the closet
that I took the broom from.

12:00.530 --> 12:03.280
So you saw a ladder
but you grabbed a broom.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.725
- You're lucky you're cute.
- H'yah!

12:05.910 --> 12:07.160
Let's go grab that ladder.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.685
But Mr. Branca's still out there.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.290
Yeah. He already waxed off.

12:10.315 --> 12:12.370
- We don't want him to wax on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:12.410 --> 12:14.750
-It's okay for me to make that joke.
-H'yah!

12:14.880 --> 12:18.010
Hello? What was that noise?

12:18.035 --> 12:19.795
- Who is that?
- Hello?

12:19.880 --> 12:20.960
It's Mr. Frond.

12:21.050 --> 12:22.800
- Oh, no.
- We're screwed.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.365
- Dang.
- Finally. I mean, fudge.

12:28.584 --> 12:30.970
- What should we do?
- Don't make a sound.

12:30.995 --> 12:33.745
I can go out there and
put a wrist lock on him.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.020
Take him down. Is that cool?

12:35.045 --> 12:37.709
No... Maybe. No.

12:37.980 --> 12:39.086
Is someone here? I heard a noise.

12:39.215 --> 12:42.045
Maybe it came from over here.

12:42.070 --> 12:44.740
What are you doing walking
all over my clean floors?!

12:44.765 --> 12:47.239
I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Branca. I
forgot today was floor waxing.

12:47.264 --> 12:49.885
I came in to try on some
shirts I bought online.

12:49.910 --> 12:51.846
The mirrors in the second floor
bathrooms are flattering...

12:51.871 --> 12:52.871
I-I mean, honest.

12:52.896 --> 12:54.356
Tell me about it.

12:54.381 --> 12:55.961
Anyway, I-I-I thought
I heard something,

12:55.986 --> 12:57.185
but I guess it was you.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.540
Yes. Now please, take off your shoes.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.130
Okay, but I have to take my
pants off to get my shoes off.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.652
- Don't ask questions.
- Oh, thank God. -

13:04.677 --> 13:07.785
Great. Now we have to sneak
around Mr. Branca and Mr. Frond.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.350
The odds are stacked against us.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.140
Two powerhouses out there.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.525
Okay, I think Mr. Frond should
be doing whatever weird thing

13:13.550 --> 13:15.390
he said he was doing
in the bathroom by now.

13:15.415 --> 13:17.957
Let's slide over to the
closet and get that ladder.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.560
Is it a corporate ladder?

13:19.585 --> 13:21.265
'Cause I'm gonna climb
that son of a bitch.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.125
Be honest.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.570
Is this terrible,
terrible place purgatory?

13:26.660 --> 13:29.855
It's worse? Oh, dear God.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.410
- And... cut.
- This is so...

13:32.435 --> 13:34.815
Who-who is your
character even talking to?

13:34.840 --> 13:37.880
- Is it your evil twin?
- Good guess, Linda, but no.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.935
It's something no other film

13:39.960 --> 13:41.710
- has ever done before.
- I give up.

13:41.735 --> 13:43.655
Death. I've been talking to Death.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.558
Oh, like that Ingmar Bergman movie

13:45.583 --> 13:47.156
where the guy's playing
chess with Death?

13:47.180 --> 13:49.260
Or that movie where
Brad Pitt plays Death?

13:49.285 --> 13:51.075
What's it called? Meet Jack Black?

13:51.100 --> 13:52.895
Nope. Totally different.
Not like those at all.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.390
I'm going to put this on
and shoot the big reveal

13:55.415 --> 13:57.745
of Death sitting across from me.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.320
If I gave you your money back, Randy,

13:59.345 --> 14:00.635
would you just leave right now?

14:00.660 --> 14:02.030
No.

14:19.842 --> 14:21.172
Hmm?

14:22.670 --> 14:24.005
Mm.

14:25.050 --> 14:27.025
Ladders are great;
they're like skinny stairs.

14:27.050 --> 14:28.630
We're gonna be outta here in no time.

14:28.655 --> 14:29.903
Yeah, and then you won't have to go

14:29.928 --> 14:31.970
to that special impulse control school,

14:31.995 --> 14:34.035
and we can keep hanging
out all day every day, Zeke.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.930
Yeah. In between classes and everything.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.455
- Quick hug.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:39.230 --> 14:40.990
So now you're just gonna
shoot the other way,

14:41.015 --> 14:42.815
- with Death reacting to Steve?
- Yes.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.880
So the big reveal of Death is just you

14:44.905 --> 14:46.665
cutting back and forth
between Steve and Death?

14:46.690 --> 14:47.925
- Yep.
- Isn't that gonna look

14:47.950 --> 14:49.310
- kind of stupid?
- Groundbreaking?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.370
You need someone else
to play Death, Randy,

14:51.410 --> 14:54.490
so you can get a shot with
both of you in it, you idiot.

14:54.515 --> 14:55.482
Oh, I'll do it.

14:55.507 --> 14:57.430
Ah, nah, Death is probably a white man.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.395
- Bob, you do it.
- Yeah, Bob, you do it.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.220
Fine, Randy, I will do it!

15:01.245 --> 15:02.411
Great, you'll need this!

15:02.436 --> 15:04.065
This is actually kind of cool!

15:04.090 --> 15:06.050
I know! You're welcome!

15:06.075 --> 15:07.927
I'm so glad y'all helped
me dodge this bullet.

15:07.952 --> 15:10.025
The other school's motto is:
"We never give up on you."

15:10.050 --> 15:11.550
That's too much pressure.

15:11.590 --> 15:13.090
Yeah, what's their problem?

15:13.115 --> 15:14.905
I mean, it sounds like
a pretty good school,

15:14.930 --> 15:17.156
but I guess you won't get
the help you need. That's all.

15:17.181 --> 15:18.172
It's like it's snowing.

15:18.197 --> 15:20.615
I'm gonna make a toilet paper angel. Ah.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.076
I wish I could be that carefree.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.810
But a lot of people depend on me.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.085
Okay, last row. Zeke, make it count.

15:26.110 --> 15:28.125
Okay, tee-pee, you don't
have to get flushed,

15:28.150 --> 15:29.860
but you can't stay here.

15:29.885 --> 15:33.780
Okay, this is clearly a
women's camouflage tank.

15:33.805 --> 15:36.305
But I'm not not pulling it off.

15:36.330 --> 15:37.976
I'll take a lap in it
and see how it feels.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.312
That's the last of it.
Like it never happened.

15:40.337 --> 15:43.210
Okay, who's in there? I heard that.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.695
- Someone's in there.
- Uh-oh.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.170
I can wait here all day.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.781
If you think I have
somewhere better to be

15:47.806 --> 15:49.310
on a Saturday, think again.

15:49.335 --> 15:51.105
- What do we do?
- I don't know,

15:51.130 --> 15:52.800
but at least he can't get in here.

15:52.825 --> 15:53.961
Oh, there's a key to this room

15:53.986 --> 15:55.786
in Ms. Schnur's office.

15:55.811 --> 15:58.021
Crap.

15:58.046 --> 15:59.650
Whoa! Oh. Oh, great.

15:59.675 --> 16:02.836
I think that's a stain. I
guess I have to keep it now.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.740
- What do we do now?
- Mr. Frond is coming back

16:08.765 --> 16:10.951
- any second with that key.
- We should go out the window.

16:10.976 --> 16:12.742
I mean, we'd fall to our
deaths because we're on

16:12.767 --> 16:13.897
the second floor, but maybe.

16:13.922 --> 16:16.175
Well, I guess this is it.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.906
I can't stand it, Zeke.

16:17.931 --> 16:18.976
Thanks for trying, everyone.

16:19.001 --> 16:20.370
I'm gonna take this stapler

16:20.395 --> 16:22.015
to remember this place by.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.226
Every time I look at this stapler,

16:23.251 --> 16:24.871
I'll think of you, Jimmy Jr.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.186
I don't know why you
picked a stapler, but okay.

16:27.211 --> 16:29.605
Zeke has a stapler and
you have me, Jimmy Jr.

16:29.630 --> 16:31.486
Everything worked out the
way it was supposed to.

16:31.511 --> 16:33.591
I thought we could fix this, Zeke.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.680
I thought I could keep us together.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.600
We did everything we could.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.888
I'll never be happy again, Zeke.

16:40.913 --> 16:43.810
It's so cute how
they're both ugly criers.

16:43.835 --> 16:45.625
I have an idea.

16:45.810 --> 16:47.166
We all transfer to the special school?

16:47.190 --> 16:49.730
- We go up.
- Do what?

16:49.755 --> 16:51.215
We go up into the ceiling,

16:51.240 --> 16:53.120
then we pull the ladder
up, replace the tile,

16:53.145 --> 16:55.581
and crawl to another spot in the
school where we can climb down.

16:55.606 --> 16:57.976
The ceiling can't hold us,
Tina, it's just those dumb tiles.

16:58.001 --> 17:00.015
The tiles can't hold us
but the cable trays can.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.740
They're bolted into the ceiling.

17:01.765 --> 17:04.040
Cable trays? What language
are you speaking, girl?

17:04.079 --> 17:05.410
All the computer cables and stuff

17:05.435 --> 17:07.290
are on these metal tracks up there.

17:07.315 --> 17:09.001
- They can hold our weight.
- How do you know that?

17:09.026 --> 17:11.826
I, um, heard that a friend
of mine, a cool friend,

17:11.851 --> 17:14.037
might've... used to go up
there and try to catch a glimpse

17:14.061 --> 17:15.655
of anything in the boys' locker room.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.010
Y-You don't know her.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.835
She's great and she's gorgeous. O-Okay.

17:18.859 --> 17:20.484
Everyone, put on your
shoes and let's go.

17:20.510 --> 17:22.520
But is it safe-ish?

17:22.545 --> 17:24.425
Just stay on the tray, and don't wobble.

17:24.450 --> 17:26.869
And spread out. And may
God have mercy on our souls.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.670
Okay, let's pull the ladder up.

17:36.395 --> 17:38.395
What on Earth is that sound?

17:39.295 --> 17:41.780
Gotcha! What the... ?

17:41.805 --> 17:45.725
So there's the story of my
life. At least, my side of it.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.966
Please, let me go back.

17:47.991 --> 17:50.330
I don't want to be
stuck in this stink hole.

17:50.355 --> 17:53.025
- Nice.
- How could anyone spend eternity

17:53.050 --> 17:55.170
in a place like this?

17:55.195 --> 17:57.105
I want to turn my life around.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.840
Can you wait to take me?
Just a few more years?

17:59.865 --> 18:03.474
Can you spare me for
just a few more years?

18:04.661 --> 18:07.161
Thank you. Thank you.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.310
Thank... you.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.400
And... cut.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.705
- Oh, that was great.
- Really?

18:13.730 --> 18:15.308
Yeah. That was, uh, that
was something, Randy.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.290
Ah! And so moving.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.160
Okay, well, then I guess that's a wrap.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.255
Thank you, Bob. I think we made

18:21.280 --> 18:22.386
something really special here today.

18:22.410 --> 18:24.290
Uh, I'm happy for you, Randy,

18:24.315 --> 18:25.855
and I'm also happy that it's over.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.645
And I'm keeping this robe;
I've never had a robe.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.130
This was a great idea, T-Bird.

18:30.155 --> 18:31.675
Do you know where we are, Tina?

18:31.700 --> 18:33.500
I think we're over the hallway.

18:33.525 --> 18:34.921
We'll have to find the
lockers and jump down on those.

18:34.946 --> 18:37.066
You lost me at "jump down."

18:37.091 --> 18:38.977
I just don't under... What?

18:39.002 --> 18:41.262
Is somebody up there?

18:41.287 --> 18:44.100
Go, go, go. Go.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.640
Zeke, throw that stapler that way.

18:47.665 --> 18:49.326
Maybe Mr. Frond will go
down the wrong hallway.

18:49.350 --> 18:51.350
- Okay.
- W-W-Wait. Wait. Wait, Zeke.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.730
Let me do it. I can fling
it like a throwing star.

18:53.755 --> 18:55.755
But Zeke's a little stronger.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.780
- I need this.
- Oh, gosh.

18:57.805 --> 18:59.345
Okay. Let it fly, little guy.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.870
I believe in you,

19:00.895 --> 19:02.925
- but also, don't mess up.
- H'yah!

19:04.410 --> 19:05.740
- Whoa.
- Wow, you got that far.

19:05.790 --> 19:07.240
- Damn.
- Now you know.

19:07.330 --> 19:09.660
Okay, gotcha!

19:12.040 --> 19:13.830
What the hell are you doing?

19:13.855 --> 19:15.855
You're getting ceiling
dirt all over my floors!

19:15.880 --> 19:18.050
- There's somebody up there.
- Move it.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.835
You are cleaning this up.

19:19.860 --> 19:22.200
-I heard people in that room, and...
-Oh, really?

19:22.225 --> 19:24.061
-And then in the ceiling.
-Well, how did they get in the ceiling?

19:24.086 --> 19:25.716
Did they fly?

19:25.955 --> 19:27.745
Here.

19:27.770 --> 19:29.980
You are ca-ca cuckoo.
You know that, Mr. Frond?

19:30.005 --> 19:31.755
I am not ca-ca cuckoo.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.336
- But I like that shirt.
- Thank you.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.160
It's a men's tank.

19:36.456 --> 19:39.110
Bye. No one's gonna
see that movie, right?

19:39.135 --> 19:40.895
Eh, maybe those tomato people will?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.675
See how many tomatoes they'll give it?

19:42.700 --> 19:44.450
This place isn't like death, is it?

19:44.476 --> 19:46.316
What? Course not.

19:46.341 --> 19:48.801
I mean, we're probably gonna
die here, but you know...

19:48.961 --> 19:52.041
- Uh, not helping.
- But not for a long, long time.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.830
And I wouldn't trade that for anything.

19:53.855 --> 19:55.895
Mwah!

19:55.920 --> 19:57.510
You want to die in our restaurant?

19:57.535 --> 20:00.090
Yeah. In 60 years.
Both of us, same time.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.381
We'll cross our eyes, stick
out our tongues and fall over.

20:02.510 --> 20:04.510
I-I think I'm gonna smile a little,

20:04.535 --> 20:06.865
so I don't freak out the
kids when they find us.

20:06.890 --> 20:09.285
They said we'd never
be able to pull it off,

20:09.310 --> 20:11.770
just like the Band-Aid on my testicles.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.045
Uh, Tina,

20:13.070 --> 20:15.125
you really made me
the happiest boy today.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.980
- I did?
- Yeah, you really came through

20:17.005 --> 20:19.101
- with that ceiling thing.
- Well, you know, it was nothing.

20:19.126 --> 20:21.085
But you can keep telling
me how happy I make you.

20:21.110 --> 20:22.585
What are you guys talking about?

20:22.610 --> 20:24.280
Just that it's all thanks to Tina

20:24.320 --> 20:26.490
that you won't be sent
away to that stupid school.

20:26.515 --> 20:29.055
That's right. You saved me, Tina.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.910
I just have to never
get in trouble again.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.080
I can do that.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.450
- Come here, you, come on.
- Ow.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.870
- Get over here.
- Zeke! Zeke! No.

20:34.895 --> 20:36.895
Don't give me a wedgie.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.556
I know it's hard to give
up having Jimmy Jr.'s butt

20:39.581 --> 20:42.380
all to yourself, but you
did the right thing, T,

20:42.405 --> 20:43.855
helping out those two idiots.

20:44.115 --> 20:45.615
I know. Stop reminding me.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.868
I hope Mr. Branca
finds the note we left.

20:48.837 --> 20:50.930
"We found your ladder in the trash

20:50.955 --> 20:53.705
"and put it back in the ceiling for you.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.780
"You're welcome! X-O-X-O,

20:55.805 --> 20:58.305
