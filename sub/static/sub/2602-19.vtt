What?

17:15.824 --> 17:18.626
Trust me. Or don't.
I'm doing it anyway.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.762
NYPD! Don't shoot!

17:20.796 --> 17:22.496
I'm here to surrender.

17:22.530 --> 17:25.031
Let the hostages go
and take me instead.

17:25.032 --> 17:26.067
Not happening.

17:26.068 --> 17:27.334
Drop the weapons!

17:27.368 --> 17:29.636
All right, all right,
my fingers are off the triggers.

17:29.637 --> 17:31.671
I'm just gonna slowly
put them down in front of me.

17:31.705 --> 17:32.705
Slowly put 'em...

17:32.740 --> 17:33.740
[Gunshots]

17:33.741 --> 17:35.175
Oh! Damn it!

17:35.209 --> 17:36.977
Terry, time!

17:37.011 --> 17:39.780
18 minutes, 28 seconds.
You broke the record!

17:39.814 --> 17:41.314
Yes! Nice!

17:41.348 --> 17:42.715
Well done.

17:42.716 --> 17:44.151
<i>(Jake) All in a day's work,
elderly lady.</i>

17:44.185 --> 17:47.619
All in a day's work.

17:47.654 --> 17:49.321
Ah, there he is!

17:49.355 --> 17:50.722
[Applause]
<i>Yeah!</i>

17:50.757 --> 17:53.025
The record is ours.

17:53.026 --> 17:54.459
That's so amazing, Jake.

17:54.494 --> 17:57.429
Check it out.
I got us prizes.

17:57.463 --> 17:59.531
Sweet. "Victim."

17:59.532 --> 18:00.599
<i>(Amy) I can't believe
your final kill</i>

18:00.633 --> 18:01.666
came with Scully's move.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.367
You went upsy-downsies?

18:03.368 --> 18:05.270
That's what I call it, because
you hold the gun upside-down.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.105
Yes, Scully,
I went upsy-downsies.

18:07.106 --> 18:09.073
And none of you will ever
speak of it again.

18:09.108 --> 18:10.975
But I want to speak of it.
You looked really dumb.

18:11.010 --> 18:13.344
[Chuckles]
Man, I feel so good.

18:13.345 --> 18:14.712
Almost makes me
want to start

18:14.713 --> 18:16.147
taking things seriously
all the time,

18:16.148 --> 18:18.515
but them I'm like,
"boobs, fart, boobs, whatever."

18:18.549 --> 18:20.583
Alright, let's go.
Drinks are on me.

18:20.618 --> 18:24.087
Nice!
Here we go, nine-nine!

18:24.122 --> 18:26.089
Actually, Teddy
asked me to get dinner,

18:26.090 --> 18:27.970
so maybe I can meet up
with you guys afterwards?

18:27.992 --> 18:30.794
Oh. Neat. Yeah.
Of course.

18:30.829 --> 18:31.829
Cool.

18:31.830 --> 18:33.963
Boobs. Fart.
Boobs, whatever.

18:36.870 --> 18:39.239
So I just talked to Vivian.

18:39.273 --> 18:40.906
I told her I really want you
to come to the wedding,

18:40.907 --> 18:41.906
and she said okay.

18:41.908 --> 18:43.643
Thanks. I'm excited to go.

18:43.677 --> 18:46.979
Also, "STD" stands for
"sexually transmitted disease."

18:46.980 --> 18:48.314
That is correct.

18:48.315 --> 18:50.383
It is, however, very expensive
to reprint those cards,

18:50.384 --> 18:52.185
so we're leaning into it.

18:52.186 --> 18:55.320
Rosie Diaz,
will you accept my STD?

18:55.321 --> 18:57.556
I look forward
to having it forever.

18:57.557 --> 18:59.191
Mm. [Giggles]

18:59.192 --> 19:00.959
<i>(Terry) Well, congratulations,
everyone, on a perfect run.</i>

19:00.993 --> 19:03.995
And a new course record.

19:04.030 --> 19:05.497
[All cheer]

19:05.532 --> 19:07.465
And congratulations to you,
Captain,

19:07.466 --> 19:09.500
on beating your
Kwazy Cupcakes addiction!

19:09.535 --> 19:10.801
[All cheer]
<i>Captain Holt!</i>

19:10.835 --> 19:13.971
Okay, I had to tell them.
It's my nature.

19:14.005 --> 19:16.407
You helped me today,
so I'll give you

19:16.408 --> 19:17.841
a pass on
embarrassing me publicly.

19:17.876 --> 19:19.777
Thank you.

19:19.811 --> 19:21.912
I feel that the reason I was
so vulnerable to this game

19:21.913 --> 19:24.147
was because technology
has evolved to the...

19:24.182 --> 19:25.415
Yeah, I don't know.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.017
I think it's just bright
and stupid and fun.

19:28.052 --> 19:29.219
So fun.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.854
So fun.
So fun.

19:31.889 --> 19:34.191
[Sighs]

19:34.225 --> 19:37.294
<i>(Charles) What's going on,
Vic Kovac?</i>

19:37.295 --> 19:39.195
What do you think
Amy sees in Teddy?

19:39.229 --> 19:41.530
So you do like her.
I'm just curious.

19:41.565 --> 19:43.365
I mean, I guess
he's okay-looking.

19:43.366 --> 19:44.633
And he's a good cop.

19:44.634 --> 19:45.601
They're both kind of dorky
about police stuff.

19:45.635 --> 19:46.968
Also, he set
the course record,

19:46.969 --> 19:49.438
but that's nothing. I broke it,
like, 20 minutes later.

19:49.472 --> 19:52.308
You want to know why she went
out with him and not you?

19:52.342 --> 19:53.442
Yeah.

19:53.476 --> 19:57.144
Because he actually
asked her out.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.548
Hey, Vivian.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.450
Rosa.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.752
I'm here to celebrate
with the team.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.222
Look, I'm not really
good at this stuff, but...

20:07.223 --> 20:09.257
Thank you for inviting me
to your wedding.

20:09.258 --> 20:10.592
I'm really happy I could come,

20:10.593 --> 20:12.226
and I promise it won't
be weird at all.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.594
Yeah, I'm really happy
you could come too.

20:13.595 --> 20:14.561
'Cause I didn't think
it was gonna happen.

20:14.596 --> 20:16.530
What do you mean?

20:16.564 --> 20:17.564
Well, Chuck told me you were

20:17.565 --> 20:18.898
gonna be out of town
that weekend,

20:18.899 --> 20:21.067
and then, you know, he just told
me that your plans changed,

20:21.068 --> 20:23.002
so, uh... so yeah,
so that's great news.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.238
Why would it be weird?

20:24.272 --> 20:27.806
Um, it'd be weird
'cause I'm weird.

20:27.841 --> 20:28.841
Oh.

20:28.842 --> 20:32.411
Whooo...

20:32.412 --> 20:33.646
I'm leaving.

20:36.015 --> 20:37.750
<i>(Amy)
Night, everyone.</i>

20:37.784 --> 20:40.720
Hey, Amy.
Check it out.

20:40.754 --> 20:42.121
No way, you won coolest kill?

20:42.155 --> 20:43.388
Not even close.

20:43.389 --> 20:44.756
It turns out anyone
can just buy themselves

20:44.757 --> 20:45.995
a children's karate trophy.

20:46.024 --> 20:47.705
Smart.
Yeah.

20:47.727 --> 20:50.666
Hey, before you go,
I wanted to ask you something.

20:50.696 --> 20:52.796
<i>(Amy)
Of course.</i>

20:52.830 --> 20:54.331
I was just wondering...

20:54.332 --> 20:55.366
Are you wearing lipstick?

20:55.367 --> 20:57.801
Yeah, I'm going out
with Teddy again.

20:57.802 --> 20:59.270
Does it look weird?

20:59.271 --> 21:01.104
I called my 13-year-old niece
for makeup tips,

21:01.105 --> 21:02.773
but I don't know
if I trust her.

21:02.774 --> 21:04.241
She is so sexual.

21:04.276 --> 21:05.842
You look great.

21:05.843 --> 21:08.010
Thank you.

21:08.011 --> 21:09.612
So what's up?

21:09.647 --> 21:12.415
Oh. It's not important.

21:12.449 --> 21:13.849
<i>I just had a question
about a work thing.</i>

21:13.850 --> 21:15.318
But have a great date,
and we'll talk tomorrow.

21:15.319 --> 21:17.019
Okay.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.690
Bye.
Bye.

21:22.326 --> 21:25.960
I'll help you with
your work stuff, Jakey.

21:25.961 --> 21:27.244
Perfect.
