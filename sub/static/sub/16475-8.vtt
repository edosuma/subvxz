WEBVTT

00:00.768 --> 00:02.070
I can't believe
they're waxing the floors

00:02.071 --> 00:03.406
and we're all stuck in here.

00:03.407 --> 00:04.709
I've never seen them
do this before.

00:04.710 --> 00:06.078
They do it once a month.

00:06.079 --> 00:07.648
We've just never been
on the night shift.

00:07.649 --> 00:10.254
I know.
It's like we're being punished.

00:10.255 --> 00:12.224
We are, for going to Florida.

00:12.225 --> 00:15.564
Oh. I don't listen
to so much stuff you all say.

00:15.565 --> 00:18.170
Well, frankly,
I pity the lot of you.

00:18.171 --> 00:20.174
You look out there
and see a problem.

00:20.175 --> 00:22.578
I look out there and see
an opportunity.

00:22.579 --> 00:24.515
I'm gonna slide
on that slippery floor

00:24.516 --> 00:27.421
all the way from Holt's office
to the elevator.

00:27.422 --> 00:28.657
You're going to do the FBP?

00:28.658 --> 00:30.494
That's right, Rosa.

00:30.495 --> 00:33.098
I'm doing The Full Bullpen!

00:39.613 --> 00:41.716

01:41.832 --> 01:43.606
Those chuckleheads
from the Nine-Five

01:43.607 --> 01:45.544
are getting all cocky
just 'cause they're on TV.

01:45.545 --> 01:47.781
Uh, we've all been
on the local news, fellas.

01:47.782 --> 01:50.019
Okay. Which case of yours
was on the news?

01:50.020 --> 01:51.966
Well, it wasn't exactly a case.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.860
Ska defines who I am
as a person,

01:53.861 --> 01:56.098
and I will never
turn my back on ska.

01:56.099 --> 01:57.100
Hup!

01:58.371 --> 02:00.207
Looking back, I have no regrets.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.242
- You should.
- Yup.

02:01.243 --> 02:02.644
So why are the Nine-Five
on the news?

02:02.645 --> 02:03.646
They're investigating
death threats

02:03.647 --> 02:05.550
against some author
named DC Parlov,

02:05.551 --> 02:07.354
as if anyone knows
who the hell that is.

02:07.355 --> 02:10.926
DC Parlov?
Did you say DC Parlov?

02:10.928 --> 02:12.831
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov

02:12.832 --> 02:16.004
is the most influential author
of our time.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.908
"The Skyfire Cycle!"

02:17.909 --> 02:21.549
12 books chronicling the war
between sky and sand,

02:21.550 --> 02:23.586
clouds and rocks,
the Sepsidians and...

02:23.587 --> 02:25.724
Oh, so it's like
a "Game of Thrones" type thing?

02:25.725 --> 02:28.363
No, "Game of Thrones" is
a "Skyfire" type thing!

02:28.364 --> 02:29.765
Get your head out of your ass!

02:29.766 --> 02:31.602
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.

02:31.603 --> 02:32.905
When I was a little kid,

02:32.906 --> 02:35.143
I spent hours reading
those books.

02:35.144 --> 02:36.145
Whoa.

02:36.146 --> 02:38.429
Little Terry did not see
that coming.

02:38.430 --> 02:40.119
I was overweight and lonely,

02:40.120 --> 02:41.889
and I wrote DC Parlov
for advice,

02:41.890 --> 02:42.791
and he sent me this!

02:42.792 --> 02:45.052
I hope it's not a severed head.

02:47.731 --> 02:51.275
"The Skyfire Cycle:
Sand Into Glass:

02:51.276 --> 02:52.778
The Reckoning of Ka'Lar."

02:52.779 --> 02:54.582
Man, that is a long book.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.072
Is the rest of it
just more of the title?

02:56.073 --> 02:58.523
It's the book
that started it all.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.894
And listen to the inscription
he wrote.

03:00.895 --> 03:03.245
"Terry, you <i>do</i> have friends.

03:03.246 --> 03:04.401
Oh, boy.

03:04.402 --> 03:07.106
"You have me.
Never forget that in this life,

03:07.107 --> 03:11.382
we write our own stories.
Parlov."

03:11.383 --> 03:13.653
And that's what happened.

03:13.654 --> 03:15.156
Little Terry wrote
his own story.

03:15.157 --> 03:17.794
Yeah, Little Terry got buff-a!

03:17.795 --> 03:19.965
Little Terry got
emotionally healthy.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.473
Yeah, and ja-a-acked.

03:22.474 --> 03:23.740
You know what?

03:23.741 --> 03:25.176
He did get jacked.

03:25.177 --> 03:27.147
Way to go, Little Terry.

03:27.148 --> 03:28.562
Big pecs coming through!

03:28.563 --> 03:30.119
Ah.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.956
There we go.

03:31.957 --> 03:34.995
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.

03:34.996 --> 03:37.801
Oh, no, never meet your heroes.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.441
Marie Callender
was a real bitch.

03:41.810 --> 03:44.848
Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled

03:44.849 --> 03:46.652
the number of arrests
on the night shift.

03:46.653 --> 03:48.790
Yeah, no one cares, okay?

03:48.791 --> 03:50.994
I need to talk top you
about this Boyle family vacation

03:50.995 --> 03:52.731
that my mom's forcing me
to go on.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.964
Why is it in Butt Thumb, Iowa?

03:54.965 --> 03:56.138
No, it's pronounced
"Beaut-Hume,"

03:56.139 --> 03:57.841
And Iowa is
the ancestral homeland

03:57.842 --> 04:00.180
of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited

04:00.181 --> 04:01.971
for you to get to know
all of the cousins.

04:01.972 --> 04:03.286
Watch out for Sherman.

04:03.287 --> 04:04.588
He's left a trail
of broken hearts

04:04.589 --> 04:05.957
longer than his ponytail.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.628
Boyle, can we please
just go to a resort

04:07.629 --> 04:08.963
where I don't have to see
your family?

04:08.964 --> 04:10.300
There's a great one in Aruba.

04:10.301 --> 04:12.437
Aruba?

04:12.438 --> 04:13.773
Boyles don't do beaches.

04:13.774 --> 04:16.011
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.

04:16.012 --> 04:17.880
Yes, I know,
you're all earthworms,

04:17.882 --> 04:21.622
but, Charles, even nature's
most disgusting creatures

04:21.623 --> 04:24.695
deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.

04:24.696 --> 04:27.413
Sorry, the cousins voted
and it was unanimous.

04:27.414 --> 04:30.206
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.

04:30.207 --> 04:32.411
"Tent" singular?

04:32.412 --> 04:34.161
Charles, "tent" singular?

04:35.351 --> 04:36.686
Diaz, Santiago,

04:36.687 --> 04:38.756
settle a little tiff
that Kevin and I are having.

04:38.757 --> 04:40.827
Let's be honest, Raymond,
it's not a tiff, it's a row.

04:40.828 --> 04:42.178
And now it's a scene.

04:42.179 --> 04:44.033
It's okay, sir,
we don't want to get involved

04:44.034 --> 04:45.069
in your personal life.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.839
It's not personal.
It's a math problem.

04:46.840 --> 04:47.874
- Oh, Mama.
- Pass.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.344
Raymond and I had dinner
together last night

04:49.345 --> 04:51.382
for the first time in two weeks,
thanks to the night shift.

04:51.383 --> 04:53.419
And Kevin thought it would be
fun to spoil our date

04:53.420 --> 04:57.059
with an inane math problem,
to which his answer is wrong.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.796
Enough foreplay,
let's get to the numbers.

04:58.797 --> 05:01.869
It's the "Monty Hall problem."
Imagine you're on a game show.

05:01.870 --> 05:04.341
There are three doors,
behind one of which is a car.

05:04.342 --> 05:05.744
You're telling it wrong.

05:05.745 --> 05:07.314
There are three doors,
behind one of which is a car.

05:07.315 --> 05:08.662
You pick a door.
The host,

05:08.663 --> 05:11.222
who knows where the car is,
opens a different door,

05:11.223 --> 05:12.758
showing you there's nothing
behind it.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.194
Now the host asks
if you'd like to choose

05:14.195 --> 05:16.587
the other unopened door.
Should you do it?

05:16.588 --> 05:17.400
- No.
- Yes.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.603
It's simple math.

05:18.604 --> 05:20.173
It doesn't make any sense
to switch.

05:20.174 --> 05:22.377
The prize is behind
one of two doors.

05:22.378 --> 05:24.094
It's a 50/50 chance either way.

05:24.095 --> 05:26.084
It's 2/3 if you switch,
1/3 if you don't.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.854
The probability locks in
when you make the choice.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.191
We've been over this
eight times.

05:29.192 --> 05:30.460
Seven times.

05:30.461 --> 05:32.697
Now you can't even do
simple addition.

05:32.698 --> 05:34.601
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.

05:34.602 --> 05:35.397
You're fired.

05:35.398 --> 05:37.233
- What?
- Ah!

05:37.234 --> 05:39.978
Hey, Sarge, great news.

05:39.979 --> 05:43.364
The guys at the Nine-Five
gave us the DC Parlov case.

05:43.365 --> 05:44.782
No big deal,
you don't have to thank me.

05:44.783 --> 05:46.325
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.

05:46.326 --> 05:48.296
- Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.

05:48.297 --> 05:49.665
I don't want to meet him.

05:49.666 --> 05:52.604
Oh, I see. You're nervous
to meet your hero.

05:52.605 --> 05:54.908
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing

05:54.909 --> 05:57.079
at a deli, and I was
so scared I almost left,

05:57.080 --> 05:59.284
but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,

05:59.285 --> 06:01.120
I walked over to him
and I introduced myself,

06:01.121 --> 06:02.841
and you know what he said to me?

06:02.842 --> 06:04.027
"Hey."

06:05.598 --> 06:07.901
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!

06:07.902 --> 06:10.707
Give him the benefit
of the doubt, Sarge.

06:10.708 --> 06:12.377
Come on, you're braver
than this.

06:12.378 --> 06:15.082
Just tell him how meaningful
the note he wrote you was.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.886
People love knowing
that they changed someone's life.

06:16.887 --> 06:17.921
I mean, why do you think
I'm doing this for you?

06:17.922 --> 06:19.090
This isn't about me.

06:19.091 --> 06:20.260
No.

06:20.261 --> 06:21.629
That was 30 years ago.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.195
He won't remember,
and I'll feel silly.

06:23.196 --> 06:25.169
Well, we're about to find out.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.572
Parlov just walked in.

06:26.573 --> 06:27.974
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

06:27.975 --> 06:29.578
All right, just breathe.

06:29.579 --> 06:31.448
Stop fanning your armpits
like that.

06:31.449 --> 06:32.450
Oh, good Lord!
Keep fanning them!

06:32.451 --> 06:34.197
- Keep fanning them!
- Oh.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.918
Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.560
Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious

06:39.561 --> 06:40.895
about why my case
got reassigned.

06:40.896 --> 06:41.922
Is there some problem?

06:41.923 --> 06:43.768
Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted

06:43.769 --> 06:45.605
New York's best detective on it.

06:45.606 --> 06:49.279
Allow me to introduce
Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.

06:51.250 --> 06:53.888
Sarge?

06:53.889 --> 06:54.990
Hi.

06:54.991 --> 06:56.827
Uh-oh. Terry,
you want to come out here

06:56.828 --> 06:58.363
and help me take
Mr. Parlov's statement?

07:01.438 --> 07:03.235
He usually stands
much taller than that.

07:03.236 --> 07:05.043
Anyway, tell us
about these death threats

07:05.044 --> 07:06.847
you've been getting. Any idea
who might be sending them?

07:06.848 --> 07:08.551
Well, I'm pretty sure
that it had to be a fan.

07:08.552 --> 07:10.087
I've had a little bit
of a backlash

07:10.088 --> 07:11.924
from some of my younger
male readers

07:11.925 --> 07:13.226
ever since I revealed the fact

07:13.227 --> 07:15.932
that Qwandor the dragon
is actually a female.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.902
I would think teen boys
would love a lady dragon,

07:17.903 --> 07:19.806
Did you give her
big, scaly boobs, or...

07:19.807 --> 07:20.775
I don't know, you're the writer.

07:20.776 --> 07:22.545
Qwandor is not a sexual being.

07:22.546 --> 07:25.885
For she is the ender
of bloodlines.

07:25.886 --> 07:29.058
All mortals tremble
before her wrath.

07:29.059 --> 07:31.964
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.934
Whoever wrote this
has got nothing on me.

07:33.935 --> 07:35.838
Uh, he's not a killer.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.274
Tell him about the inscription.

07:37.275 --> 07:39.946
You probably don't remember,
but 30 years ago,

07:39.947 --> 07:42.619
I wrote you a letter telling you
how lonely and sad I was,

07:42.620 --> 07:44.255
and you sent me a book
with the inscription,

07:44.256 --> 07:47.996
"We all write our own stories,"
and it changed my life.

07:47.997 --> 07:49.966
- I do remember you.
- You do?

07:49.967 --> 07:53.206
I do indeed, and I'm delighted
you made something of yourself.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.978
As the Cloud Rock says...

07:55.979 --> 07:58.283
"You found yourself
in your struggle."

07:58.284 --> 07:59.419
Wow.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.423
"The truth is
what you came for,

08:01.424 --> 08:04.730
and you found it
within your strife."

08:04.731 --> 08:06.299
Well, that was cool.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.938
- "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.

08:08.939 --> 08:13.814
"Tolgan the last,
Tolgan the first, Tolgan."

08:13.815 --> 08:15.785
"Tolgan."

08:15.786 --> 08:16.787
Is it over?

08:16.788 --> 08:19.593
Yes.
This is the best day of my life.

08:19.594 --> 08:20.595
You have three kids, Terry.

08:20.596 --> 08:21.663
I said what I said!

08:21.664 --> 08:22.430
All right.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.607
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!

08:26.608 --> 08:27.609
Up high.

08:27.610 --> 08:28.611
Down low.

08:28.612 --> 08:30.013
Butts! Butts! Butts!

08:30.014 --> 08:32.049
Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?

08:32.051 --> 08:33.153
- Oh.
- Mervyn's.

08:33.154 --> 08:35.023
Oh.

08:35.024 --> 08:37.027
Gina, get your rear over here.

08:37.028 --> 08:38.664
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.

08:38.664 --> 08:40.802
Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.

08:40.803 --> 08:42.905
Yeah, I just wanted
to get to know Sam better,

08:42.907 --> 08:45.043
and talk about
the upcoming vacation.

08:45.044 --> 08:45.921
I got him his favorite...

08:45.922 --> 08:48.717
egg salad on white,
bowl of cottage cheese...

08:48.718 --> 08:50.888
Hard boiled egg on the side.

08:50.889 --> 08:51.924
Oh, no.

08:51.925 --> 08:53.193
Oh, yes.

08:53.194 --> 08:56.934
Turns out Sam here also thinks
we should go to Aruba.

08:56.935 --> 08:58.225
N... I know it sounds crazy,

08:58.226 --> 09:01.677
but the Caribbean might be
more fun than Iowa.

09:01.678 --> 09:03.179
In what universe?

09:03.180 --> 09:05.016
I'd tell you to pack
sunscreen, but...

09:05.017 --> 09:07.989
Mm, looks like
you already got burned.

09:07.990 --> 09:09.191
Uh-oh, did I?

09:09.192 --> 09:11.405
'Cause my skin still tastes
pretty raw.

09:11.406 --> 09:12.966
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.368
13-2, Iowa.

09:14.369 --> 09:17.876
For now, but I have a whole day

09:17.877 --> 09:20.515
of Boyle cousins scheduled,
starting with Bobby Boyle

09:20.516 --> 09:23.834
at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.

09:23.835 --> 09:25.836
You think you can
pick us off one-by-one?

09:25.837 --> 09:28.430
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.

09:28.431 --> 09:30.568
Boyles are very weak
as individuals.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.239
But, together,
we're unbreakable.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.943
I'm calling a council
of the cousins!

09:34.944 --> 09:38.016
I'm scared!
Just kidding. Come on, Sam.

09:38.017 --> 09:39.084
Sam, stay.

09:39.085 --> 09:41.088
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.

09:41.089 --> 09:42.224
Come on, Sam.

09:42.225 --> 09:44.028
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.

09:44.029 --> 09:45.193
- Come on.
- Stay.

09:45.194 --> 09:46.690
- Come.
- Stay.

09:46.691 --> 09:49.102
All right,
let's get on this case.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.638
I can't let my hero die.

09:50.639 --> 09:53.443
Great. Parlov is in town
for a reading of his new book,

09:53.444 --> 09:55.948
"The Skyfire Cycle:
A Bridge to Jarcata."

09:55.949 --> 09:59.422
Ah, ah. It's actually
pronounced "Jarca-a."

09:59.423 --> 10:01.092
All the T's in "Skyfire"
are silent.

10:01.093 --> 10:02.762
This book sounds
impossible to read.

10:02.763 --> 10:03.864
I know, right?

10:03.865 --> 10:05.834
Okay. All the death threats
were sent from New York,

10:05.835 --> 10:07.471
so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike

10:07.472 --> 10:08.707
at the book reading
tomorrow night.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.144
And he's probably
camped out on the street

10:10.145 --> 10:11.513
with the other fan boys.

10:11.514 --> 10:12.815
They've been lined up
for three days.

10:12.816 --> 10:14.986
To listen to an old man
read a story?

10:14.987 --> 10:16.289
I will never understand
this world.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.725
You once took a train
to Toronto to get

10:17.726 --> 10:19.681
a Canadian VHS copy
of "Die Hard."

10:19.682 --> 10:21.232
There was a rumor it was
better sound quality.

10:21.233 --> 10:22.802
Get a grip, Terry.

10:22.803 --> 10:25.140
We just need a way to compare
the fans' handwriting

10:25.141 --> 10:27.378
to the death threats.

10:27.379 --> 10:29.649
Oh! We get them
to sign a petition

10:29.650 --> 10:31.235
to make Qwandor the dragon
a male.

10:31.236 --> 10:32.922
Ooh, "smorf."

10:32.923 --> 10:34.726
But are we going to fit in there
dressed like this?

10:34.727 --> 10:37.157
No.
No, we're not.

10:38.167 --> 10:39.902
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

10:39.903 --> 10:42.375
<i>♪ So I'm outside of da club ♪</i>

10:42.376 --> 10:46.583
<i>♪ And you think I'm a punk ♪</i>

10:46.584 --> 10:50.591
Sign our petition to make
Qwandor the dragon a male!

10:50.592 --> 10:52.294
There are already
enough girl characters.

10:52.295 --> 10:54.031
We don't need a third!

10:56.427 --> 10:57.761
Good evening, sir.

10:57.762 --> 10:58.807
No, it's not.
I haven't slept,

10:58.808 --> 11:00.711
because I've been
going over that stupid problem.

11:00.712 --> 11:02.815
Now I finally understand
Kevin's side.

11:02.816 --> 11:04.318
Cool, so it's all better

11:04.319 --> 11:05.686
and I never have to hear
about math again?

11:05.687 --> 11:06.823
Quite the opposite.

11:06.824 --> 11:09.362
I know better than ever
how incorrect he is.

11:09.363 --> 11:10.731
Probability doesn't kick in.

11:10.732 --> 11:12.935
Do I have to teach you
college level statistics?

11:12.936 --> 11:13.870
I don't know,
do I have to teach you

11:13.871 --> 11:15.039
high school statistics?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.114
Do I have to teach you
eighth grade statistics?

11:17.115 --> 11:18.824
Do I have to teach you
seventh grade statistics?

11:18.825 --> 11:20.451
Do I have to teach you...

11:20.452 --> 11:22.121
Now, if you'll excuse me,
detectives, I need to leave him

11:22.122 --> 11:25.622
a snide voicemail
about kindergarten statistics.

11:27.232 --> 11:29.769
Okay, we have got to explain
this thing to Captain Holt

11:29.770 --> 11:31.606
to save their relationship.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.741
And you laughed at me
when I went

11:32.742 --> 11:34.645
to that weekend-long
math conference.

11:34.646 --> 11:35.881
'Cause you called it "funky cats

11:35.882 --> 11:36.916
and their feisty stats."

11:36.917 --> 11:38.987
That was the name!
It was so cool.

11:38.988 --> 11:40.824
It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.761
They haven't seen each other
because of the night shift.

11:42.762 --> 11:43.557
They just need to bone.

11:43.558 --> 11:46.936
What? Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!

11:46.937 --> 11:48.607
I mean...
That's not what I think.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.410
- Captain Dad is just my boss.
- Wow.

11:50.411 --> 11:53.483
Never mind, I'm teaching
father the math!

11:53.484 --> 11:55.687
Whatever, Rosa.

11:55.688 --> 11:56.856
To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling

11:56.857 --> 11:58.627
a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword,

11:58.628 --> 12:00.564
and I'm wearing what,
a potato sack?

12:00.565 --> 12:01.966
You're my noble squire.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.937
You should be thankful
for that burlap,

12:03.938 --> 12:05.579
it's hiding your terrible
failed castration.

12:05.580 --> 12:07.244
Oh, my God, I hate these books.

12:07.245 --> 12:09.249
Are you the guys passing out
the Qwandor petition?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.959
Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.421
You bet they do.

12:12.422 --> 12:14.792
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just

12:14.793 --> 12:17.097
that women aren't
strong enough to be dragons.

12:17.098 --> 12:19.092
Now, handeth me yon "petish."

12:19.093 --> 12:20.904
Okay.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.107
"Petish" handeth yon'd.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.579
This is a start,
but if you really want

12:24.580 --> 12:26.816
Parlov to hear you,

12:26.817 --> 12:28.955
you're gonna have to send
a message in blood.

12:31.731 --> 12:34.298
I think we've got a suspect.

12:34.299 --> 12:35.300
Let's ride.

12:35.301 --> 12:37.838
Whoa, that's very heavy.

12:37.839 --> 12:40.009
Halitosis Frodo's got to be
our guy, right?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.279
Oh, yeah.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.817
"A message in blood"
is a reference to book one.

12:43.818 --> 12:45.160
Page 843.

12:45.161 --> 12:48.159
After Wendivil betrayed
Prince Clevang, murdered him,

12:48.160 --> 12:50.123
and used his blood to write
letters to his children.

12:50.124 --> 12:52.334
Do you talk about this stuff
with Sharon?

12:52.335 --> 12:53.126
No. She hates it.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.753
Yeah, makes sense.

12:54.754 --> 12:56.342
Uh, This writing
doesn't match up.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.506
I'm gonna send it
to the lab anyway.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.080
Yeah, I don't think
that's necessary.

12:59.081 --> 13:00.082
Why not?

13:00.083 --> 13:03.089
Because I just found
a perfect match.

13:03.090 --> 13:06.056
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.

13:06.057 --> 13:07.966
Terry did not see that coming.

13:09.980 --> 13:12.484
And that is a perfect match.

13:12.485 --> 13:13.819
This is crazy.

13:13.820 --> 13:16.325
Why would Parlov
send himself a death threat?

13:16.326 --> 13:18.396
For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.

13:18.397 --> 13:19.498
His book is on
the best-seller list

13:19.499 --> 13:20.862
for the first time in years.

13:20.863 --> 13:22.370
Parlov doesn't need any help.

13:22.371 --> 13:24.207
He's already famous, rich.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.410
He's got more babes
than he can handle.

13:25.411 --> 13:26.912
Come on, that guy?

13:26.913 --> 13:28.683
Now you're just lying
to prove a point.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.831
He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.

13:30.832 --> 13:32.591
Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.

13:32.592 --> 13:34.561
It can be disappointing
to meet your hero.

13:34.562 --> 13:36.298
I mean, just like me
and Patrick Ewing.

13:36.299 --> 13:38.964
- You said that went great.
- I lied. It was a disaster.

13:38.965 --> 13:41.075
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing,
my name is Jake Per...

13:41.076 --> 13:42.611
- Oh, no!
- Wha...

13:42.612 --> 13:44.881
- Hey!
- You're my favorite player.

13:44.882 --> 13:47.764
You pantsing Patrick Ewing
has nothing to do with this.

13:47.765 --> 13:50.226
It doesn't? Oh, my God,
why did I share that story?

13:50.227 --> 13:52.831
There is no way Parlov
sent himself that death threat.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.635
Look, we are gonna
go to his hotel,

13:54.636 --> 13:57.024
we're gonna talk to him,
and he'll have an explanation.

13:57.025 --> 13:58.876
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!

13:58.877 --> 14:01.048
I'm sorry, I thought
you were gonna disagree.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.989
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.

14:05.658 --> 14:07.701
Is everything okay, Santiago?

14:07.702 --> 14:10.533
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?

14:10.534 --> 14:12.972
Actually...

14:12.973 --> 14:15.309
it's behind one of these
three doors.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.578
Why don't you pick one?

14:16.579 --> 14:19.084
Are you trying to Monty Hall me?

14:19.085 --> 14:20.586
It's unbelievable.

14:20.587 --> 14:23.092
I don't need Monty Hall
ruining my place of work

14:23.093 --> 14:25.496
when Monty Hall has already
ruined my home life.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.600
Come on, sir, the math thing
isn't the problem.

14:27.601 --> 14:29.237
Night shift's keeping you
and Kevin apart.

14:29.238 --> 14:30.932
You two just need to bone.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.744
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.

14:32.745 --> 14:34.848
I said you two need to bone.

14:34.849 --> 14:39.758
How... dare you, Detective Diaz.

14:39.759 --> 14:42.430
I am your superior officer!

14:42.431 --> 14:43.820
Bone!

14:43.821 --> 14:45.670
What happens
in my bedroom, Detective,

14:45.671 --> 14:47.674
is none of your business.

14:47.675 --> 14:49.177
Bone?!

14:49.178 --> 14:51.816
Don't ever speak to me
like that again.

14:55.057 --> 14:56.325
Why did you do that?

14:56.326 --> 14:57.962
Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.398
Problem solved.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.339
The council of the cousins.

15:03.340 --> 15:06.445
Look at them.
It's like a Beige of Pigs.

15:06.446 --> 15:08.115
Gina, you seem rattled.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.584
You don't normally make puns.

15:09.585 --> 15:11.755
That's a pun?
On what?

15:11.756 --> 15:14.327
Listen, Charles,
I'm gonna sway the council.

15:14.328 --> 15:16.966
So give up now unless you enjoy
being humiliated

15:16.967 --> 15:18.602
- in front of your family.
- Oh,

15:18.603 --> 15:20.473
you think I'd be embarrassed
in front of them?

15:20.474 --> 15:24.181
In front of Don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.

15:24.182 --> 15:27.353
- And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.

15:27.354 --> 15:29.224
Hello, cousins.

15:29.225 --> 15:30.793
Bobby, Brendan, Bill,

15:30.794 --> 15:33.132
Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.

15:33.133 --> 15:37.707
Papa Boyle once said:
"Stay in the middle.

15:37.708 --> 15:39.544
"That's where it's safe.

15:39.545 --> 15:40.680
"That's where we thrive.

15:40.681 --> 15:42.884
That's... Iowa."

15:42.885 --> 15:45.857
Charles will tell you
believe that Aruba

15:45.858 --> 15:49.598
isn't for the Boyles,
but picture this:

15:49.599 --> 15:52.737
one long banana boat
with the 15 of us on it,

15:52.738 --> 15:54.774
holding each other by the waist,

15:54.775 --> 15:57.847
having the time
of our damn lives.

15:57.848 --> 16:00.319
Do we really wanna go where
"Pirates of the Caribbean"

16:00.320 --> 16:01.655
- took place?
- Yes!

16:01.656 --> 16:03.692
No!

16:03.693 --> 16:05.529
That movie gave us
nightmares for moths!

16:07.001 --> 16:09.304
Y'all know I got y'all
aqua socks!

16:09.305 --> 16:11.976
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.

16:11.977 --> 16:15.883
In conclusion,
Boyles are nothing if not loyal.

16:15.884 --> 16:19.591
Loyal to our favorite brand
of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.

16:19.592 --> 16:23.399
Loyal to each other
and loyal to Iowa.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.881
- I love you.
- I love you.

16:25.882 --> 16:29.611
I'm Gina Linetti,
and I approve this message.

16:29.612 --> 16:31.615
I love you.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.385
I love you.

16:33.386 --> 16:37.193
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.

16:37.194 --> 16:39.269
I think we'll sleep on it
and we'll vote in the morning.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.271
Council adjourned.

16:41.272 --> 16:43.739
- I love you.
- I love you.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.714
Hey.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.716
What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,

16:48.717 --> 16:49.718
I'm a little busy right now.

16:49.719 --> 16:51.755
I've some female companions
over, you know.

16:51.756 --> 16:52.890
Oh, really?
What are they,

16:52.891 --> 16:55.429
like, some nerdy sci-fi fans,
or...

16:55.430 --> 16:57.033
Good Lord!

16:57.034 --> 16:58.246
I don't know
what I'm looking at.

16:58.247 --> 17:01.775
I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.

17:01.776 --> 17:03.585
Okay, stop saying "pulls."

17:03.586 --> 17:05.295
Mr. Parlov, we have to
talk to you.

17:05.296 --> 17:07.339
Now, we're not accusing you
of anything.

17:07.339 --> 17:09.023
We just want to ask
a few questions.

17:09.025 --> 17:10.859
You know, we're probably wrong.

17:10.861 --> 17:12.630
- We should just go.
- Sarge, no.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.732
God, you're strong!

17:13.733 --> 17:15.569
Mr. Parlov,
did you send yourself

17:15.569 --> 17:16.872
those death threats
for publicity?

17:16.873 --> 17:17.874
Are you kidding me?

17:17.875 --> 17:19.434
I have no need for publicity.

17:19.435 --> 17:20.746
The handwriting
in the death threats

17:20.747 --> 17:22.383
matches perfectly
with the inscription

17:22.384 --> 17:23.419
you wrote to Terry.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.887
Yeah, tell you the truth,

17:24.888 --> 17:27.317
I didn't actually
write this inscription myself.

17:27.318 --> 17:28.494
What?

17:28.496 --> 17:29.898
Come on, you guys, grow up.

17:29.899 --> 17:31.668
You think I have time
to answer each letter I get

17:31.669 --> 17:33.281
from every sad little
fat kid that writes me?

17:33.282 --> 17:34.808
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants,

17:34.809 --> 17:36.845
precisely for that sort of crap.

17:36.846 --> 17:37.981
But you said you remembered me.

17:37.982 --> 17:39.784
Because you were the cop
assigned to my case.

17:39.785 --> 17:41.621
Look, I didn't want to
piss you off.

17:41.622 --> 17:43.826
The man you're looking for,
he's my ex-assistant.

17:43.827 --> 17:45.329
His name is Edmund Grail.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.431
The guy hates me.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.467
I slept with his wife,

17:47.468 --> 17:48.588
so naturally, I had to fire him.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.881
Yeah, that's a cool story.

17:49.882 --> 17:51.875
After that, I got sort of
involved with his sister.

17:51.876 --> 17:53.212
- It was kind of hot...
- Please stop talking.

17:53.213 --> 17:54.614
Fine.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.818
I have a little bit of research
to attend to myself,

17:56.819 --> 17:58.388
if you understand
what I'm talking about.

17:58.389 --> 17:59.791
Enjoy having sex

17:59.792 --> 18:01.963
with three gorgeous women
in cosplay.

18:01.964 --> 18:05.336
Well, that went terribly.

18:05.337 --> 18:06.605
I'm so sorry.

18:06.606 --> 18:07.907
Do you need a moment alone

18:07.908 --> 18:09.177
or you want to
talk about it or...

18:10.814 --> 18:12.362
Yep yep.
That works, too.

18:12.363 --> 18:14.715
Hey, good news.

18:14.716 --> 18:16.585
I found the address of
Parlov's old assistant.

18:16.586 --> 18:17.788
I'm gonna go over there
and question him.

18:17.789 --> 18:19.792
You want to come?

18:19.793 --> 18:21.228
Maybe he won't open the door

18:21.229 --> 18:22.397
and you'll have to kick it down.

18:22.398 --> 18:23.733
That always cheers you up.

18:23.734 --> 18:25.536
I don't feel like
kicking down doors.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.106
What about running
really fast through a wall,

18:27.107 --> 18:28.709
leaving a perfect outline
of your body?

18:28.710 --> 18:29.779
Like a cartoon?

18:29.780 --> 18:31.148
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

18:31.149 --> 18:32.617
I'm just gonna sit here
and think about

18:32.618 --> 18:35.056
how the words I lived by
my entire life

18:35.057 --> 18:36.458
are a big fat lie.

18:36.459 --> 18:38.395
Look, Sarge,
I understand what it's like

18:38.396 --> 18:40.901
to have a hero who doesn't act
the way you want him to.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.905
It's not gonna be about
Patrick Ewing again, is it?

18:42.906 --> 18:44.474
No, and it's not about
John Starks, either,

18:44.475 --> 18:45.443
who I also pantsed.

18:45.444 --> 18:47.063
How many Knicks
have you pantsed?

18:47.064 --> 18:50.066
Including coaches, five,
but that's not the point.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.457
The hero
I was talking about is you.

18:52.458 --> 18:56.231
You're a great cop and dad
and husband and boss.

18:56.232 --> 18:58.283
And also, you always smell
just a little bit like vanilla.

18:58.284 --> 18:59.772
That's my soap.

18:59.773 --> 19:01.241
I got it at Lush.

19:01.242 --> 19:03.112
You're who I want to be
when I grow up, Terry.

19:03.113 --> 19:04.715
And you should know
that some dumb inscription

19:04.716 --> 19:07.053
in some stupid book
isn't what made you who you are.

19:07.054 --> 19:09.090
And it bums me out
that you can't see that.

19:09.091 --> 19:11.261
Now, I'm gonna go
get this bad guy,

19:11.262 --> 19:13.706
because that's what
you taught me to do.

19:15.343 --> 19:17.440
Also what was the name
of the soap store again?

19:17.441 --> 19:18.961
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.648
Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.

19:21.649 --> 19:23.391
<i>Well, it was a real hard
decision,</i>

19:23.392 --> 19:24.587
<i>but ultimately we decided</i>

19:24.588 --> 19:25.924
<i>the Boyles are going to Aruba!</i>

19:27.929 --> 19:29.765
All right, Sam, well,
I'm happy to hear that.

19:29.766 --> 19:31.468
I think the sun's gonna be
really good

19:31.469 --> 19:33.105
for everyone's psoriasis.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.278
<i>We're all so excited.</i>

19:35.279 --> 19:37.280
<i>All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.</i>

19:37.281 --> 19:38.448
Whoops.
Lost you.

19:38.449 --> 19:40.619
It was almost too easy.

19:40.620 --> 19:43.119
I'm like the Temple Grandin
of herding Boyles.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.454
Yes, you are.

19:44.455 --> 19:46.398
What?
Why are you smiling?

19:46.399 --> 19:47.734
I don't get it.
I won.

19:47.735 --> 19:49.337
Did you?

19:49.338 --> 19:51.044
You were so busy trying to beat
the Boyles, you became one.

19:51.045 --> 19:53.178
You learned about
our likes and dislikes,

19:53.179 --> 19:54.849
our allergies and our phobias.

19:54.850 --> 19:57.133
You even bought cousin Sherman
a scrunchy for his ponytail.

19:57.134 --> 19:58.689
Yeah, so I could win.

19:58.690 --> 19:59.691
And you did win...

19:59.692 --> 20:02.222
a plot in the family cemetery.

20:02.223 --> 20:03.348
All of us together

20:03.349 --> 20:05.517
lying in a grave for eternity!

20:05.518 --> 20:06.671
"Grave" singular?

20:06.672 --> 20:08.436
Charles, "grave" singular?

20:08.437 --> 20:10.446
Oh, Captain,
I know you don't want to

20:10.447 --> 20:12.816
talk about Monty Hall,
but I did contact a math...

20:12.817 --> 20:14.621
No need, Santiago.
It's all good.

20:14.622 --> 20:15.689
So the fight with Kevin is over?

20:15.690 --> 20:16.726
Yep.

20:16.727 --> 20:17.627
Because you
understand the math now?

20:17.628 --> 20:18.629
Nope.

20:18.630 --> 20:19.631
- Because you guys...
- Yep.

20:19.632 --> 20:21.969
Knew it.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.907
See, what happened is,
your dads had sex.

20:23.908 --> 20:24.994
Okay, Rosa.

20:27.916 --> 20:29.384
Edmund Grail?

20:29.385 --> 20:30.754
Who wants to know?

20:30.755 --> 20:31.588
NYPD.

20:31.589 --> 20:32.991
I need to ask you
a few questions

20:32.992 --> 20:33.920
about DC Parlov.

20:33.921 --> 20:35.429
Oh, okay.

20:35.430 --> 20:36.599
Let me just undo the chain.

20:43.346 --> 20:44.950
Son of a bitch.

20:49.458 --> 20:50.827
Freeze!

20:51.964 --> 20:56.104
Taste the might of Ka'Lar!

20:56.105 --> 20:57.608
Get him out of here.

20:59.746 --> 21:00.738
Nice work, Sarge.

21:00.739 --> 21:01.882
You were right.

21:01.883 --> 21:03.786
Who cares about Parlov?

21:03.787 --> 21:05.256
We write our own stories.

21:05.257 --> 21:07.593
So welcome
to the Terry Chronicles.

21:07.594 --> 21:08.730
Book One:

21:08.731 --> 21:10.800
The Arrest of Edmund Grail.

21:10.801 --> 21:12.503
Followed by Book Two:

21:12.504 --> 21:14.307
The Ravishing of Sharon.

21:14.308 --> 21:15.609
I am so sorry.

21:15.610 --> 21:16.746
I'm just pumped
that you showed up.

21:16.747 --> 21:18.081
I couldn't let you down.

21:18.082 --> 21:20.653
And that is why you are my hero.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.456
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.

21:22.457 --> 21:23.793
Oop...

21:23.794 --> 21:24.795
Oh, no!

21:24.796 --> 21:26.531
It happened again!

21:26.532 --> 21:28.511
It happened again, Terry!
