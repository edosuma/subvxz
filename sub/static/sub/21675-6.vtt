has history with you.

42:31.300 --> 42:32.600
I don't think
that you're a bad guy.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.300
Like, you're my type of guy.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.066
- I don't wanna regret
never knowing

42:36.066 --> 42:37.734
that she wanted
nothing to do with me.

in the soup.

what they ask for.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.734

a resting bitch face?

42:52.734 --> 42:55.066
- Whoa, Adam.
- Bang.

42:55.066 --> 42:56.734

they weren't very happy.

than I thought I would.
