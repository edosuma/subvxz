The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.879 --> 00:05.620
Do you have any idea
what you did?

00:05.714 --> 00:06.955
You fucking bitch!

00:08.675 --> 00:09.756
You're being so mean.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.719
She got someone executed.
She doesn't feel sorry about it.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.449
She should have kept
her fucking mouth shut.

00:14.473 --> 00:18.262
You will never be free of me
until both of my children are safe.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.851
That is my constant prayer
for Nichole.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.520
You will not let her go!

00:22.606 --> 00:23.847
Because I love her!

00:23.941 --> 00:26.649
This isn't love.
You can't love!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.438
You don't know how!

00:28.904 --> 00:30.691
Ofmatthew doesn't want
her baby.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.397
Well, it was just a second.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.527
That's a sin.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.911
Sinner. Sinner.
Sinner. Sinner.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.308
<i>And to refuse
God's blessings of a child...</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:45.709
...is among
the gravest of sins.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.213
<i>Sinner. Sinner. Sinner.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:52.629
Natalie!

00:54.429 --> 00:56.591
Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:58.725 --> 01:00.637
No! No!

01:05.649 --> 01:09.063
<i>Ooh, baby, do you know
What that's worth</i>

01:09.695 --> 01:12.859

<i>I didn't at first.</i>

You'll hear it.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.313
<i>They don't give Ofmatthew
anything that might hurt the baby.</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:32.768
<i>There's no future for her
in any case.</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:36.468
<i>"There's too much bleeding,"
they say.</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:39.153
<i>"Her brain is gone,"
they say.</i>

02:41.912 --> 02:43.619
<i>Ofmatthew is just
a vessel now,</i>

02:44.331 --> 02:45.822
<i>and the baby is
all that matters.</i>

02:47.334 --> 02:49.041
<i>I suppose it's all
that ever mattered.</i>

03:05.769 --> 03:10.889
<i>The doctors and nurses and orderlies
and technicians come and go.</i>

03:12.401 --> 03:13.642
<i>I stay.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:16.735
<i>Thirty-two days so far.</i>

03:19.741 --> 03:22.484
<i>I will be here until
there's a baby.</i>

03:24.955 --> 03:27.663
<i>"This is your walking partner,"
Aunt Lydia said.</i>

03:28.250 --> 03:29.786
<i>"Where else would you be?"</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:36.372
<i>Ooh, baby, do you know

<i>Ooh, heaven is

03:41.012 --> 03:44.881

04:00.699 --> 04:02.065
<i>Ooh</i>

04:04.327 --> 04:07.365
<i>Heaven is a place on Earth</i>

04:32.397 --> 04:34.764
<i>The wives come
to pray with Mrs. Calhoun.</i>

04:35.901 --> 04:38.359
<i>"Please, God,
protect this child.</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:40.853
<i>"Bring forth your miracle.</i>

04:41.907 --> 04:45.116
<i>"We've been so faithful
and good.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:49.866
<i>"'Heaven is a place on Earth, '
dear God."</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:55.914
<i>They smell
of powder and soap.</i>

04:56.505 --> 04:58.087
<i>They smell like the ceremony.</i>

04:59.466 --> 05:01.924
<i>Like Serena Joy,
when she held me down.</i>

05:04.971 --> 05:06.758
<i>It's hard not to fucking gag.</i>

05:21.071 --> 05:24.735
<i>When Aunt Lydia brings everyone to pray,
it smells like sweat.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:29.410
<i>Like onions and oranges and fish
from the grocery store.</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:32.997
<i>It smells like tape and pus</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:37.619
<i>from Janine's wounds, still healing after
what Ofmatthew did to her.</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:03.064
<i>I will be here
until there's a baby...</i>

06:09.744 --> 06:11.280
<i>However long that takes.</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:19.786
<i>This room has a smell,
citrus and ammonia.</i>

06:20.672 --> 06:23.915
<i>It would have been in spray bottles before,
at the grocery store.</i>

06:24.593 --> 06:25.925
<i>Or Bed Bath and Beyond.</i>

06:27.012 --> 06:28.594
<i>And then mostly from Amazon.</i>

06:29.347 --> 06:30.929
<i>When there were
all those things.</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:33.674
<i>Before the Internet raids.</i>

06:33.977 --> 06:37.311
<i>Before the decency codes
and all the hangings.</i>

06:39.482 --> 06:40.723
<i>She has a smell too.</i>

06:41.610 --> 06:44.273
<i>A kind of sweet decay,
like wet leaves.</i>

06:44.654 --> 06:45.940
<i>Like a dirty scalp.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:47.984
<i>Like her shit.</i>

06:48.992 --> 06:52.235
<i>Soft, unformed, blameless.</i>

06:54.623 --> 06:55.955
<i>She smells like a baby.</i>

07:35.246 --> 07:36.612
<i>They're not real, you know.</i>

07:43.004 --> 07:44.040
<i>They're not.</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:51.734
<i>Maybe I'm crazy and this is
some new kind of therapy.</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:56.776
<i>I wish that were true,
then I could get better.</i>

08:57.579 --> 09:00.913
<i>And this would go away.
I could leave this room.</i>

09:02.667 --> 09:04.499
<i>This would all end.</i>

10:47.939 --> 10:49.100
<i>This has to end.</i>

11:12.964 --> 11:16.082
<i>Ooh, heaven is
A place on Earth</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:19.756
<i>They say in heaven
Love comes first</i>

11:20.138 --> 11:22.755
<i>We'll make heaven
A place on Earth</i>

11:22.849 --> 11:25.887
Dear God,
please watch over this child.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.515
Hey, pray, stupid.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.394
Let Him hear
your devotion, girls.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.982
Your heavenly powers overcome
sickness and infirmity.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.240
Dear God,
please watch over this child.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.991
You gather your lambs in arms
and carry them in your bosom.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.624
Dear God,
please watch over this child.

11:50.793 --> 11:55.413
Ofhoward, put yourself together, please.
Hair out of your face.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.384
Nothing is uglier than vanity,
Ofhoward.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.516
That's better, dear.

12:12.774 --> 12:16.267
Look upon us with eyes
of mercy, O Lord.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.380
It's okay,
it's not so bad.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.112
- May this child grow in the grace...
- It's gross.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.691
- ...and knowledge of Our Heavenly Father.
- It's not fair.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.888
To Him be the glory...

12:29.874 --> 12:32.491
All right, girls, let's give them room
to do their work.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.914
Come on.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.208
Excuse me, ladies.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.790
What challenges has
the Lord given us this morning?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.376
Her pressure's
creeping up again. 145 over 110.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.425
Push 200 milligrams of Labetalol
and draw for labs.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.797
White count first.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.265
Now, how's our patient?

12:53.815 --> 12:54.855
Fetal heart rate
is stable.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.311
Oh, praise be.
Let's keep it that way.

13:06.828 --> 13:07.828
What's happening?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.154
She's having seizures.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.243
If you're lucky,
you may get

13:16.337 --> 13:17.623
to see her shit herself.

13:22.468 --> 13:26.883
You are a heartless,
heartless girl, Ofjoseph.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.596
He who is most merciful,

13:32.395 --> 13:33.806
please hear our prayers

13:33.896 --> 13:35.307
and save this child.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.567
Please, God, let them die.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.405
Please, God, let them die.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.401
Please, God...

13:51.581 --> 13:52.697
...let them die.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.089
Lovely. Lovely.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.338
Okay.
Clean that up, please.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.594
Excuse me, Doctor, may I ask
what you're doing?

14:15.396 --> 14:16.932
A saphenous cutdown.

14:17.815 --> 14:22.230
I am placing a small tube
into the femoral vein.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.945
Basically, it's a fancy name
to get in more fluids.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.568
Should help control
the seizures,

14:28.201 --> 14:29.863
and our little miracle

14:30.536 --> 14:32.994
needs plenty of fluids.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.572
Ah, of course.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.910
Tie and anchor that suture closed, please.
Don't worry about the scar.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.373
Glory be with you.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.795
Ah, go in grace.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.463
The miracles God allows
these doctors to perform.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.132
It's simply awe-inspiring.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.388
Well, under His eye, dear.

15:02.777 --> 15:03.858
Hold on a minute.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.614
Pardon?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.483
I'm sorry. Um...

15:12.870 --> 15:14.031
Aunt Lydia...

15:16.874 --> 15:18.536
May I go home, please?

15:20.878 --> 15:24.462
No. You may not.
Ridiculous!

15:26.467 --> 15:27.467
Please.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.887
You may go home
when your walking partner goes home.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.218
You certainly owe her that consideration
after the way you have treated her.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.014
I know.
I know I was shitty.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.810
Ofjoseph.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.106
All you girls,
just awful.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.234
I know. I know. I...

15:52.076 --> 15:53.283
I don't feel well.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.077
Ofjoseph,

16:01.502 --> 16:02.834
I believe in you.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.914
God never gives us more
than we can handle.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.668
Are you sure?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.880
Pray without ceasing.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.302
That's all we can do.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.688
Yes, Aunt Lydia.

16:54.263 --> 16:58.177
<i>Ooh, heaven is
A place on Earth</i>

17:01.896 --> 17:04.058
<i>Place on Earth</i>

17:07.527 --> 17:08.893
<i>Place on</i>

17:11.489 --> 17:12.730
<i>Earth</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:30.496
You don't fool me.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.257
I know you're gone already.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.313
Hi.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.024
Hi.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.738
What are you doing here?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.315
Got infected.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.867
They have to do
another procedure.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.701
Oh.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.705
Oh.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.898
I haven't been
praying for her.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.088
Not really.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.008
Okay.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.559
She had that seizure.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.644
Do you think that was
your fault?

20:37.361 --> 20:38.397
Obviously.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.993
Do you think
she can hear me?

20:49.999 --> 20:51.206
I don't know.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.000
Hi, Natalie.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.840
It's Janine.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.464
I just want you to know
that I forgive you.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.302
And I want you to get better.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.608
She can't get better.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.813
I can wish for it anyway.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.035
I want you to find peace.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.245
Is that better?

21:45.679 --> 21:46.715
Janine.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.426
I know
how we can help her.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.876
- No.
- Janine,

22:19.755 --> 22:21.166
it's the right thing to do.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.169
Listen to me.

22:26.804 --> 22:27.885
We have to end it.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.218
So you're going to kill her?

22:33.727 --> 22:34.808
And the baby?

22:37.231 --> 22:38.472
What did they ever
do to you?

22:42.027 --> 22:44.610
Janine, we have to.
We have to do something.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.276
Don't do that.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.237
She's one of us.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.382
Okay.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.886
Okay?

23:16.729 --> 23:17.810
Yeah.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.848
Okay. Okay.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.273
Give that to me.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.338
When did you get to be
so selfish?

23:48.510 --> 23:52.049
Everything is always
about you now. Your problems.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.974
Get the fuck out of here.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.598
You're different.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.113
I don't like it.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.838
The lungs aren't fully formed yet,
and won't be for a few weeks,

24:33.931 --> 24:36.639
but we can take care of it
in the NICU, if need be.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.917
They're not gonna
come in here, are they?

24:43.941 --> 24:46.103
- Those sick girls?
- They're not sick.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.481
They're here for
their menarche exam.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.939
They've flowered?
How lovely.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.316
<i>That will be Hannah soon.</i>

24:55.744 --> 24:57.030
<i>Too soon.</i>

24:57.121 --> 25:00.034
It'll be a few years before they're ready
to have babies of their own.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.577
<i>He doesn't mean
emotionally ready.</i>

25:05.671 --> 25:08.288
<i>He means they track
their pelvic development.</i>

25:11.802 --> 25:13.338
<i>She's got prominent veins.</i>

25:14.179 --> 25:15.761
<i>Easy to slice, I'd think.</i>

25:17.391 --> 25:18.802
<i>His aren't bad either.</i>

25:19.643 --> 25:21.009
<i>Harder to see.</i>

25:22.646 --> 25:25.480
<i>If I only get one kill,
I should start at the top.</i>

25:25.607 --> 25:26.848
<i>Make it count.</i>

25:30.029 --> 25:31.110
<i>Eenie,</i>

25:33.157 --> 25:34.193
<i>meenie...</i>

25:35.492 --> 25:36.608
<i>...minie,</i>

25:41.040 --> 25:42.656
<i>moe.</i>

25:42.750 --> 25:44.352
I'm sorry
I couldn't get here sooner.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.854
Oh, that's all right.
Thank you for coming.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.790
Of course.
I've been praying for you.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.121
And I for you.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.959
Our precious babies.

25:51.050 --> 25:54.384
Commander, we can discuss
the rest of the lab tests in my office.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.517
Mrs. Waterford, may I speak
to you for a moment?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.394
You don't want
to bother with that.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.648
I'll catch up
with you downstairs.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.325
Yes, Ofjoseph?

26:24.625 --> 26:27.288
Come closer.
It's a secret.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.961
What?

26:44.061 --> 26:45.393
You're not well.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.768
No.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.060
June?

27:09.503 --> 27:11.290
You're out of your mind.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.917
This has to end.
This has to end.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.551
You were supposed to be
one of the strong ones.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.886
There's something wrong.
She cut herself.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.353
Mrs. Waterford said
you cut yourself.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.401
Let me see.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.566
It's all right.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.195
Ouch.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.497
You need stitches.

28:57.778 --> 28:58.894
Come.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.854
Sit.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.532
It's a clean slice.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.781
Just a few more.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.042
You doing okay?

29:17.673 --> 29:19.630
You shouldn't bother
trying to fix me

29:19.716 --> 29:21.548
if you're just
going to report me.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.012
You're right.
I shouldn't.

29:38.485 --> 29:39.646
Thank you.

29:41.363 --> 29:42.570
I took an oath.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.780
First do no harm.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.107
Am I harming you?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.948
You're torturing her.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.448
She's not my patient,
the child is.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.874
That's bullshit.

29:55.544 --> 29:56.830
Sir.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.081
Hold still.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.966
My mother was a doctor.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.763
She treated pregnant women.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.895
And she always
put her patients,

30:21.028 --> 30:23.111
the women, first.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.319
Things were different
when she practiced medicine.

30:28.910 --> 30:30.026
Did she get out?

30:30.120 --> 30:31.156
No.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.869
I'm sure you miss her.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.628
Where did she practice?

30:40.756 --> 30:43.499
Somerville.
For the most part.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.303
Holly Maddox.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.179
Well,

30:55.103 --> 30:57.937
now I know why you took
a swipe at Mrs. Waterford.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.481
Dr. Maddox.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.272
Dr. Maddox, she was scary.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.948
Yeah. She is.

31:11.787 --> 31:12.994
Was.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.281
I don't actually know.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.087
You should know
I was going to kill Serena.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.132
And her.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.469
And you, too.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.352
I warned them.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.819
I said, "You can't leave
that girl in here,

31:47.489 --> 31:50.448
"praying for months on end."

31:52.536 --> 31:55.074
The brain atrophies
in isolation

31:56.248 --> 31:57.830
and breeds despair.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.830
How long have you had
suicidal thoughts?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.083
Homicidal.

32:09.177 --> 32:12.511
Doing any of the things that you
said would put you on the wall,

32:13.140 --> 32:14.676
and you know it.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.346
So, how long?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.265
I don't know.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.074
Since I realized

32:33.160 --> 32:35.527
I probably won't see
my daughters again.

32:43.170 --> 32:44.752
You feel hopeless?

32:46.006 --> 32:47.497
How should I feel?

32:56.933 --> 33:00.097
Doctor, she's someone's
child, too.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.023
I honor the Handmaid's life

33:12.532 --> 33:14.319
by saving her child.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.827
How will you honor
your daughters?

33:29.382 --> 33:31.089
Try not to get that wet.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.129
Under His eye.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.032
Okay. Take that.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.126
Here we go, gentlemen.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.677
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.425
Okay.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.187
Okay.

36:14.756 --> 36:16.372
Praise be.

36:16.466 --> 36:17.707
Take him.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.892
She's not gonna last
much longer.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.392
Stitch her up.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.857
- You could use the practice.
- Yes, sir.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.892
Can I carry that
for you?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.437
Sure. Thank you.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.152
Did you just
have a baby?

38:07.452 --> 38:08.738
No.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.578
I was visiting a friend.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.534
Oh.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.166
Is she really sick?

38:19.088 --> 38:20.249
Yeah.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.333
Well, the Lord
will heal her.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.760
You just have to
pray hard enough.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.212
Praise be.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.557
I'm here because they said
I can have babies.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.347
Later, not right now.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.687
After I get married.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.482
Is that what you want?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.938
Of course. So much.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.197
Rose.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.646
Ofjoseph, come along.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.745
She's still alive.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.951
Not for much longer,
as I understand.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.166
God will call her home
soon enough.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.416
- It's been quite an ordeal.
- Aunt Lydia.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.585
I need to stay with her.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.921
If I may.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.260
Oh...

40:39.979 --> 40:41.595
That would be
very kind of you.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.682
Go in grace, Ofjoseph.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.187
I'll try.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.014
Blessed be the fruit, dear.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.437
May the Lord open.

41:27.777 --> 41:30.110
The doctor said
the procedure went well.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.319
Yeah, he said... Mmm...

41:35.952 --> 41:37.784
I mean, all thanks to God.

41:38.788 --> 41:41.872
May his healing light
shine upon you.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.918
I brought you something.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.425
Nothing wrong with
wanting to look your best.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.843
Let me help you.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.524
Here. Take this off.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.155
Okay. Gently.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.091
I look like a pirate.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.425
Indeed.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.762
A space pirate.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.035
It's okay.

43:07.627 --> 43:08.993
It's all right.

43:10.213 --> 43:11.420
I'm here.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.048
I'll be right here.

43:24.977 --> 43:27.435
I'm sorry I was
such a shit to you.

43:32.652 --> 43:34.689
I got lost, I think.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.650
Not that that's
a good excuse, but...

43:45.748 --> 43:47.614
I don't really
have another reason.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.421
They just take everything
from you, you know.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.212
They really do.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.801
Oh, your son,

44:08.396 --> 44:09.978
he's beautiful.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.352
Oh, he's...

44:15.319 --> 44:17.185
He is beautiful.

44:19.866 --> 44:21.858
And everyone
is praying for him,

44:21.951 --> 44:25.240
but I wouldn't worry,
seriously.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.990
Because I think
he's just like you.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.663
He's a fighter.

44:39.135 --> 44:43.004
And he doesn't deserve
to grow up in this place.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.010
He deserves to be free.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.272
They all deserve to be free.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.775
So, Natalie...

45:09.415 --> 45:11.122
I'm gonna get them out.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.328
I'm gonna get out
as many children as I can.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.800
I don't really
know how yet, but...

45:25.473 --> 45:27.055
I swear to you,

45:30.978 --> 45:32.594
I'm gonna get them out.

45:39.528 --> 45:42.692
Because Gilead should
know how this feels.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.448
It's their turn to hurt.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.088
All right.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.208
It's okay.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.255
It's all right.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.643
<i>Ooh, baby, do you know
What that's worth?</i>

46:14.313 --> 46:17.977
<i>Ooh, heaven is
A place on Earth</i>

46:22.822 --> 46:24.404
Do you remember that song?

46:32.498 --> 46:34.990
<i>They say in heaven</i>

46:40.798 --> 46:42.881
<i>Love comes first</i>

46:43.843 --> 46:47.757
<i>We'll make heaven
A place on Earth</i>

46:52.059 --> 46:55.518
<i>When the night falls down</i>

46:56.397 --> 47:00.767
<i>I wait for you
And you come around</i>

47:00.860 --> 47:04.319
<i>And the world's alive</i>

47:05.239 --> 47:09.825
<i>With the sound of kids
on the street outside</i>
