WEBVTT

00:05.257 --> 00:09.344
Come on, boys!
it's Leap Day, not Sleep Day!

00:09.428 --> 00:11.221
Whoo!

00:11.305 --> 00:13.599
I love Leap Day!

00:13.682 --> 00:15.809
it's kind of a
big deal in the Dunphy house.

00:15.893 --> 00:17.436
This year, we even
got Manny involved.

00:17.519 --> 00:19.897
You're given this gift
of 24 extra hours.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.899
You can't waste it
at work or school.

00:21.982 --> 00:24.776
You have to do something
extraordinary, something shocking.

00:24.860 --> 00:29.072
Mmm. This year, the entire family
is taking a trapeze class.

00:29.198 --> 00:31.366
How extraordinary is that?
It was my idea.

00:31.491 --> 00:34.536
How shocking is that? I can be
spontaneous every four years.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.913
I can't wait.

00:35.996 --> 00:37.915
Leap Day is stupid.

00:37.998 --> 00:39.791
You're not understanding
the logic behind it.

00:39.875 --> 00:44.087
A year is actually 365.25 days.

00:44.171 --> 00:46.256
Every four years,
we gain one day.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.800
If we didn't adjust
the calendar, in, say, 40 years,

00:48.884 --> 00:51.220
February would almost be January.

00:51.303 --> 00:55.390
That's not my problem.
And it's definitely not your problem.

00:55.474 --> 00:59.102
Look at this. The housekeeper turned
another one of my whites pink.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.938
I can't wear this
to a sports bar.

01:01.021 --> 01:03.106
They're not going
to be looking at you, Jay.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.775
Somebody's feeling
pretty good about herself.

01:04.858 --> 01:06.568
They're going to be
watching the match.

01:06.652 --> 01:09.154
You meant you a little bit.

01:10.447 --> 01:11.865
Okay, put it in there.

01:11.949 --> 01:14.993
All right. Very quietly, we're
gonna go to Daddy's bedroom,

01:15.077 --> 01:16.703
open the door and-

01:19.373 --> 01:20.958
Happy birthday to me.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.710
I'm 10!
Forty!

01:23.794 --> 01:25.254
I was born February 29,

01:25.337 --> 01:27.464
and there have been
10 of those in my lifetime,

01:27.547 --> 01:29.466
therefore I'm 10!

01:29.549 --> 01:30.550
It's fun.

01:30.634 --> 01:32.219
It's so much fun.

01:32.302 --> 01:34.346
Anyway, I've spent
the last four years...

01:34.429 --> 01:36.765
trying to figure out what kind
of party to throw this one.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.433
Honey, you know
I'd be fine with just...

01:38.517 --> 01:40.269
a nice casual evening
at home with you.

01:40.352 --> 01:41.728
Don't- Don't even.

01:41.812 --> 01:44.064
No, no. That's what
he said last time.

01:45.232 --> 01:47.776
Okay, birthday boy.
What's it gonna be?

01:47.859 --> 01:49.444
Rom-com or horror?

01:49.528 --> 01:51.405
Or we could do both
and watch Maid in Manhattan.

01:51.530 --> 01:53.115
What you doing?

01:53.198 --> 01:55.033
Canceling our baby.

01:56.702 --> 01:58.578
# Hey, hey #

01:58.662 --> 02:00.622
# Hey, hey #

02:00.706 --> 02:02.624
# Hey, hey #

02:02.708 --> 02:04.626
# Hey, hey #

02:04.710 --> 02:05.877
# Hey ##

02:08.170 --> 02:11.049
Okay, love to Dad. Bye.

02:13.719 --> 02:15.512
Daddy, what are you doing? Oh.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.556
- Yeah, Daddy, what are you doing?
- I was-

02:17.639 --> 02:19.474
Snooping for hints
about your birthday?

02:19.558 --> 02:21.518
Wow. Get.

02:21.601 --> 02:24.021
No, I'm just excited,
and I want to be helpful.

02:24.104 --> 02:25.939
I know party planning
isn't your thing.

02:26.023 --> 02:27.316
Wow.

02:27.399 --> 02:29.192
You need to trust me, Cam.

02:29.276 --> 02:30.986
I know. And I do.

02:31.069 --> 02:32.904
It's not like you're gonna do
anything tired,

02:32.988 --> 02:34.698
like appletinis
or ice sculptures.

02:34.781 --> 02:36.325
Or synthetic napkins
or anything Mylar.

02:36.408 --> 02:37.617
Cam, that's enough.

02:37.701 --> 02:39.786
I've been paying for your
last party for four years.

02:39.870 --> 02:41.496
And I find it a little insulting...

02:41.580 --> 02:43.206
that you don't think
I could pull this off.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.042
You know what?

02:45.125 --> 02:46.877
I trust you. I'm letting go.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.962
Okay? Okay-

02:49.046 --> 02:52.007
- You know orange is over, right?
- it's a simple party. I can do it.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.884
Simple.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.761
Perfect.

02:55.844 --> 02:57.971
Yeah, just a simple party.

02:58.055 --> 03:00.057
I'm simply taking Cam's favorite
movie,

03:00.140 --> 03:01.641
The Wizard of Oz,

03:01.725 --> 03:04.561
and turning our house
into an Oz-themed extravaganza.

03:04.644 --> 03:06.188
Yellow brick carpet,

03:06.271 --> 03:08.023
waitstaff in full costume...

03:08.106 --> 03:10.275
and custom-made
ruby slippers for Cam.

03:10.359 --> 03:11.818
Whassup?

03:11.943 --> 03:14.613
So is this safe?
it's a trapeze.

03:14.696 --> 03:19.034
Relax. More people are killed by
knife-wielding strangers than from trapezing.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.036
I'm thinking about
going home now.

03:21.119 --> 03:25.374
# In the arms of the angels #

03:25.457 --> 03:27.501
These animals
need your help.

03:27.584 --> 03:29.294
Honey, are you okay?

03:29.378 --> 03:30.712
I'm fine.

03:30.796 --> 03:33.673
I'm fine. Just-
So sad.

03:36.051 --> 03:38.053
Oh, no. Not today.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.930
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.391
No, your mom's
just, uh, feeling emotional.

03:42.474 --> 03:44.267
She was like this
last month.

03:44.351 --> 03:46.478
And the month before.
And the month before.

03:46.561 --> 03:50.065
What? I could kill someone!
No, I can't hear you!

03:50.148 --> 03:53.318
This stupid phone gets no reception
in this stupid house!

03:55.404 --> 03:56.905
Dear God, no.

03:56.988 --> 03:58.907
I heard rumors. Yeah.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.742
We all had.

04:00.826 --> 04:02.911
That females living or working
in close quarters...

04:02.994 --> 04:05.747
could eventually
get on the same cycle.

04:05.831 --> 04:10.001
But I always assumed that was a story designed
to keep women out of the submarine corps.

04:12.462 --> 04:16.007
This isn't milk. What's wrong with me today?
My brain's not working right.

04:16.132 --> 04:18.635
No!  I can't foc-

04:18.718 --> 04:20.303
Won't you help ?

04:20.387 --> 04:21.971
Three legs?

04:22.055 --> 04:23.098
It's not fair!

04:23.181 --> 04:25.892
I know. it's so sad.

04:25.976 --> 04:28.103
Oh, my God.
They're gonna ruin everything.

04:28.186 --> 04:30.564
No,no,no. We-We just need
to be extra sensitive.

04:30.647 --> 04:32.649
Phil, honey,
when do we need to leave?

04:32.732 --> 04:34.734
Whenever's good for you, sweetie.
Maybe 20 minutes?

04:34.860 --> 04:36.361
Twenty minutes? Well,
which one is it, Phil?

04:36.486 --> 04:39.739
Whenever is
good for me, or is it 20 minutes?

04:39.823 --> 04:41.366
Whenever you're ready.

04:41.450 --> 04:44.578
It happened.
Satan's trifecta.

04:44.661 --> 04:47.539
The day I most dreaded had
fallen on the day I most loved.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.794
They're gonna ruin trapezing.

04:52.878 --> 04:54.629
I bet they don't
even catch me.

04:54.713 --> 04:56.965
Why are you so afraid of them?
They're reasonable.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.885
Why don't we just suggest they stay home,
considering they're all on their mens-

04:59.968 --> 05:02.387
Shh! The first rule of
dealing with the cycle:

05:02.471 --> 05:04.055
You never mention the cycle.

05:04.139 --> 05:06.308
You tiptoe around it.

05:06.391 --> 05:10.395
The woman's actually taking great pains
to hide the monster she's become.

05:10.479 --> 05:13.565
But if you acknowledge it,
that brings the monster forth.

05:13.648 --> 05:16.693
My God.
And there's three of them.

05:16.776 --> 05:19.738
It's okay. I have a plan.

05:20.906 --> 05:23.492
It's kind of traditional
for people to lean in...

05:23.575 --> 05:25.535
when somebody says
“I have a plan.”

05:26.745 --> 05:27.704
Okay-

05:27.787 --> 05:30.457
Ja! Ja! Ja! Ja!

05:30.540 --> 05:32.292
Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja!

05:32.417 --> 05:35.587
No! No!
Sí! Sí! Sí! Sí! Sí!

05:35.670 --> 05:40.342
Go! Go!

05:40.425 --> 05:42.886
You should call your country the
Never-lands because you never-

05:42.969 --> 05:46.139
Ja, because we are never going to win.
You said that a billion times.

05:46.223 --> 05:47.682
Just go home.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.851
Why don't you
Dutch people go home?

05:49.935 --> 05:52.103
Someone should shut
your Colombian mouth.

05:52.229 --> 05:54.648
Okay, I want to see you try.
ls there a problem over here?

05:54.731 --> 05:56.816
Yes, there is a problem,
and you are married to her.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.570
Really? Well,
let me make a suggestion.

06:00.654 --> 06:03.990
Why don't you sit down, I send you over a
beer, my wife and I watch from over there.

06:04.074 --> 06:05.992
That way,
everybody enjoys the game.

06:06.076 --> 06:09.162
Except me, 'cause I prefer
a game where something happens.

06:09.246 --> 06:11.122
Gloria, let's go.

06:14.668 --> 06:17.128
I thought you were going to
punch that guy back there.

06:17.212 --> 06:19.047
Ah, I got 60 pounds
on the kid.

06:19.130 --> 06:23.051
Yeah. it's just that I'd heard so
many stories about you fighting.

06:23.176 --> 06:26.972
It's just not worth the trouble.
Yeah, and he has all those friends.

06:27.055 --> 06:28.890
Well, his friends
had nothing to do with it.

06:28.974 --> 06:30.725
Just sometimes it's better
to take the high road.

06:30.809 --> 06:32.978
Yeah, it's better
that you walked away.

06:33.061 --> 06:36.773
Gloria, I get- I get the impression you're
disappointed I didn't punch that guy.

06:36.856 --> 06:41.403
Of course not. Who needs all that
manly “protect your woman” stuff?

06:41.486 --> 06:43.405
No, see, like right there.
You're saying one thing,

06:43.488 --> 06:45.156
but it feels like
you mean the opposite.

06:45.282 --> 06:47.117
No.
That's a yes.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.494
Look, Jay. I just came
to watch the game.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.371
I don't want to fight.
Neither do I.

06:52.539 --> 06:54.749
I know.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.459
So, in keeping
with the film,

06:56.543 --> 07:01.214
this area will be in black and white,
and then an explosion of Technicolor.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.842
Best part, as
the guests are coming in-

07:03.925 --> 07:05.719
“Auntie Em! Auntie Em!”

07:05.802 --> 07:07.721
A simulated tornado.

07:07.804 --> 07:09.472
Yeah.
Oh, he's gonna love that.

07:09.556 --> 07:11.641
So the
appletinis are canceled-

07:11.766 --> 07:13.810
Yes. the little Toto
dog is ordered, and-

07:13.893 --> 07:16.313
Please tell me that you are
not mixing punch in costume.

07:17.772 --> 07:21.401
Oh, no.
What is Cam doing home?

07:22.527 --> 07:23.695
Hey-
Hey-

07:23.778 --> 07:25.614
- We're the monkeys.
- Yes, hi. Come on inside.

07:25.697 --> 07:27.616
Quickly, quickly. Hi.

07:27.699 --> 07:29.451
Okay, one second.

07:29.534 --> 07:32.370
Hey. What you doing home? Are you
checking on me and the party again?

07:32.454 --> 07:35.624
No, no. I left my cell phone in your car,
and I gotta be in touch with Mama today.

07:35.707 --> 07:37.626
She's talking to the insurance
agency for the first time...

07:37.709 --> 07:39.502
to see if they're gonna
rebuild Grandpa's farm.

07:39.586 --> 07:41.504
Rebuild the-

07:41.588 --> 07:43.298
Because of the tornado.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.133
I totally
missed the connection.

07:45.216 --> 07:49.137
A month after the most devastating
twister to ever hit Cam's hometown,

07:49.220 --> 07:54.768
I throw a party based on gay
cinema's most famous tornado.

07:54.851 --> 07:57.062
Yeah. You know,
it's been a month,

07:57.145 --> 07:59.773
and she hasn't heard anything,
and she's just beside herself.

07:59.856 --> 08:02.734
And then- You know what else?
Lily succumbed to her injuries.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.861
- Your Aunt Lily died?
- No, the family pig.

08:04.944 --> 08:07.947
Aunt Lily was a-
We named our daughter after a pig?

08:08.031 --> 08:10.283
Can you just witness my pain
instead of criticizing?

08:10.367 --> 08:12.452
I just want to be in touch
with my family today.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.663
Get all this tornado stuff
behind me...

08:14.746 --> 08:18.166
so I can enjoy the fabulous
party you're planning for me.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.293
Yeah. Gotta get outta here.

08:20.377 --> 08:24.297
Okay. Hey, listen. Hey, Cam, you just
call your family, tell them I said hi.

08:24.381 --> 08:27.676
And don't worry about being back at 6:00 on the dot.
There's a little breathing room.

08:27.759 --> 08:29.636
Oh, what, are you kidding me?

08:29.719 --> 08:32.472
The sooner I can start to party,
the sooner I can start to forget.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.808
But then again,
hey, if you keep running from...

08:34.890 --> 08:37.811
every reminder of the tornado,
doesn't the tornado win?

08:37.894 --> 08:39.938
Mitchell, my grandpa runs to his
pickup truck every morning...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.315
because he thinks the pitchfork
is gonna come back down.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.609
The tornado always wins.
Yeah.

08:44.693 --> 08:47.445
Okay. Well, it's
gonna be so much fun tonight!

08:47.529 --> 08:50.240
- I know. The big 1-0!
- 4-0!

08:50.365 --> 08:52.742
Hey, Mitchell!
I'm over here.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.369
I could've hit you. But you didn't.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.912
I'm doing
my “I Love You” dance.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.831
Okay. I'm doing
my “I Love You” car dance.

08:57.956 --> 08:59.541
Look at me.
Look at you.

08:59.624 --> 09:00.875
Stop that.
Fish move!

09:00.959 --> 09:02.419
Okay, go!

09:02.544 --> 09:04.212
This is dangerous. Go.
Okay, okay.

09:04.337 --> 09:06.506
Get out of here, you.
it's my birthday!

09:07.966 --> 09:09.592
All right, guys. Come here.

09:09.676 --> 09:11.886
We need to talk.

09:13.638 --> 09:16.099
There they are.
Stop rushing us!

09:16.182 --> 09:18.184
Buddy, what's wrong?

09:18.268 --> 09:20.895
Yes, you've been
a little off all morning.

09:20.979 --> 09:23.189
I've been feeling
a lot of stress lately.

09:23.273 --> 09:25.567
My head's all foggy,
and I'm kind of emotional.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.861
Oh. Well, I sure hope
you feel better soon,

09:27.944 --> 09:31.030
'cause you really need your wits
about you when you're trapezing.

09:31.114 --> 09:35.869
This is weird, because the three of us haven't
exactly been feeling our best today either.

09:35.994 --> 09:38.329
Really?  Can't
find my other sock!

09:38.413 --> 09:40.957
- Try looking under the one you have on.
- I am not you.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.752
I don't do that. See?

09:43.835 --> 09:45.336
God, I am you.

09:46.671 --> 09:49.174
- Would you mind if we sat out trapezing?
- Really?

09:49.299 --> 09:51.342
Yeah. Are you sure?
Okay.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.678
Why does he do that?
Every month.

09:53.762 --> 09:55.847
Yeah, I get a little moody,

09:55.930 --> 09:59.476
but unrelenting physical discomfort
will do that to a person.

09:59.601 --> 10:03.980
Doesn't he know that tiptoeing around someone
like they're crazy makes them crazy?

10:04.063 --> 10:06.733
All right. You and Manny go ahead.
Luke can just stay here with us.

10:06.816 --> 10:09.152
- Wait. What?
- Luke's actually looking better.

10:09.277 --> 10:11.488
I am better. Well, let's
not take any chances.

10:11.613 --> 10:13.740
He can stay here. You go ahead.
Dad?

10:13.823 --> 10:15.617
- Um, I-
- Daddy?

10:15.700 --> 10:18.661
- See you later, buddy.
- What are we going to do?

10:18.745 --> 10:20.580
We leave no man behind.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.625
I think I'm just
gonna go home.

10:23.708 --> 10:27.045
We have time. Just take down the
decorations and have a normal party.

10:27.128 --> 10:28.880
And throw a boring party
in our house...

10:28.963 --> 10:30.882
that looks like I just threw
it together this afternoon?

10:31.007 --> 10:32.592
Think!
Okay, we have a few options.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.636
I can get you
the back room at Amelia's.

10:34.719 --> 10:37.305
Spilled juice on the owner's white rug
and almost killed her toddler. Next.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.932
Bowling alley?
Not classy enough.

10:39.057 --> 10:40.517
What have you got?
Uh-

10:40.600 --> 10:43.436
You're no help. You. Well, last
weekend I did a party on a boat.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.897
- You said you were visiting your parents.
- You're suffocating me.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.649
What's this boat?
Tell me about the boat.

10:47.732 --> 10:51.194
Okay, we did an elegant dinner party
on a luxury yacht for about 25 people.

10:51.277 --> 10:53.655
It takes you around the harbor,
dancing under the moonlight.

10:53.738 --> 10:56.616
Okay. Okay. Maybe we can
make a theme out of this.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.660
Cam's life is like a long voyage.

10:58.743 --> 11:01.579
Sometimes choppy, but always
forward- ever forward.

11:01.663 --> 11:03.706
- We have two hours.
- Book it.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.877
Hey. You survived
trapeze class, huh?

11:08.002 --> 11:11.798
Didn't happen. And common decency
prevents me from telling you why.

11:11.881 --> 11:13.675
- How was the soccer match?
- Thrilling.

11:13.758 --> 11:16.177
1-1 tie. One of the goals
was an accident.

11:16.261 --> 11:18.012
I'm sure my mom
was happy you went.

11:18.096 --> 11:21.099
I don't know what to make of her today.
She got into it with this guy,

11:21.182 --> 11:23.643
and I swear she was pushing me
into a fight with him.

11:23.768 --> 11:26.062
Now, is that something she'd want?
I don't know.

11:26.145 --> 11:28.565
I always thought of women
as the more evolved sex.

11:28.648 --> 11:30.567
But after today-
I've seen things, Jay.

11:30.650 --> 11:33.278
As you know, I had my share of
fights in my time. You know that.

11:34.279 --> 11:37.532
Mmm, it's-
it's too warm for me.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.034
I remember this time I was
crossing the street with Dede,

11:40.118 --> 11:42.203
and some jackass
almost clipped her.

11:42.287 --> 11:45.832
I had the guy on the ground, my foot on
his neck, before the car stopped moving.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.458
Yeah, we've heard
all the stories.

11:47.542 --> 11:50.420
Maybe my mom wouldn't mind
a glimpse of that Jay.

11:50.503 --> 11:54.215
That's her. She wants me to help pick out Cam's gift.

11:54.299 --> 11:56.551
I'm still that guy,
you know. 100%.

11:56.634 --> 11:59.053
What the hell? How do you cut
your finger on a cracker?

11:59.137 --> 12:01.723
Anyway, if I thought there was a
fight worth fighting, I'd fight it.

12:01.806 --> 12:04.392
Ow! Now I got salt in this.
That stings!

12:09.480 --> 12:11.649
Next time, don't scream at your boss...

12:11.733 --> 12:13.735
so that he doesn't make you
work during the weekends.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.613
Y pueda venir a ver
a tu hijo, por favor.

12:16.696 --> 12:18.740
Sí. Adíos.

12:18.823 --> 12:20.867
Hey, Mom.
Who were you yelling at?

12:20.950 --> 12:25.204
Your father, baby.
He cannot make it this weekend.

12:27.332 --> 12:29.250
Okay, I admit it.

12:29.334 --> 12:33.254
I wanted Jay to kick that little
Dutchman's ass at the bar.

12:33.338 --> 12:35.590
But two seconds
on the phone with Javier,

12:35.673 --> 12:39.719
and I remember what that stupid
hothead behavior gets you.

12:39.802 --> 12:43.431
Nothing. it's better
to be calm, like Jay.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.183
Like Jay and me.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.477
Like Jay.

12:49.604 --> 12:53.566
I'm back! Wouldn't you know, I
forgot my ding-dang sunglasses.

12:53.650 --> 12:54.609
Oh.

12:54.692 --> 12:57.528
Huh. Luke,
could you give me a hand?

12:57.612 --> 12:59.906
What were the chances
that Phil had come back...

12:59.989 --> 13:02.116
to apologize
for all the game-playing...

13:02.200 --> 13:05.453
and have an open conversation
with me about what I was feeling?

13:05.536 --> 13:08.957
Okay, I got a bottle of fake blood
out of the Halloween supplies.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.084
Put a dab on your finger,
say you cut it,

13:11.167 --> 13:13.544
I say I need to run you by
the doctor, easy trapezey.

13:13.670 --> 13:16.339
Got it? See you on the
other side, brother.

13:16.422 --> 13:20.385
Just once, I would like Phil
to have a little empathy.

13:20.468 --> 13:24.722
Give me some sense that he
understands what women go through.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.933
You feelin' any better?

13:27.016 --> 13:28.935
Hate to see
the whole team on the D.L.

13:29.018 --> 13:32.772
- Ow! My finger!
- I don't like the sound of that.

13:36.067 --> 13:39.654
- I said a little bit.
- The cap fell off. I decided just to go with it.

13:39.779 --> 13:42.490
Okay, we gotta get you out
the back-

13:42.573 --> 13:44.701
- What happened?
- Oh, it's just a little cut.

13:44.784 --> 13:46.703
But to be safe,
I'll run him by the doctor.

13:46.786 --> 13:48.705
No! Are you crazy?
Call 911!

13:48.830 --> 13:50.957
Oh, no, they're so busy.
Where's the wound?

13:51.040 --> 13:53.376
- We need to put pressure on it, right?
- I'm gonna be sick!

13:53.459 --> 13:55.503
Oh, he needs a tourniquet!
Where do I put it?

13:55.586 --> 13:57.714
Stop. There is nothing
wrong with him.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.799
- Luke, what's going on?
- I cut my finger.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.301
- Dad?
- How crazy is that?

14:02.385 --> 14:04.387
They were in my pocket the whole time.
I'll see you.

14:04.470 --> 14:07.140
Phil!
What is going on, Luke?

14:07.223 --> 14:10.435
Dad staged the whole thing so we could
go on the trapeze without you three.

14:10.518 --> 14:14.647
- Why?
- Because- Because-

14:14.731 --> 14:17.567
You're all monsterating!

14:17.692 --> 14:19.569
Luke, no!
Are you kidding me?

14:19.652 --> 14:21.154
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.

14:21.237 --> 14:23.740
I know you told me not to
say it, but-  Phil.

14:23.823 --> 14:25.742
Is this what you've been
teaching our son?

14:25.825 --> 14:28.077
That women are some kind of
unclean lepers...

14:28.161 --> 14:30.288
that should be hidden away
under sheets for a week?

14:30.371 --> 14:33.708
- Do you have any idea how offensive that is?
- I do, honey.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.503
And from the bottom
of my heart, I am so...

14:37.587 --> 14:39.088
scared.

14:40.048 --> 14:42.091
Oh, no!

14:42.175 --> 14:44.302
Oh, my.

14:49.140 --> 14:52.727
Okay. Three, two, one!

14:52.810 --> 14:54.479
Surprise!

14:54.604 --> 14:57.023
Oh, my gosh! Oh, it's amazing!
Yeah, it's a boat party!

14:57.148 --> 14:59.275
Oh. Because?
Your life is like a voyage.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.943
Oh. Well, everyone's is,

15:01.027 --> 15:03.696
but I love it because none of our
other friends have ever done it.

15:03.780 --> 15:04.739
Oh.

15:04.822 --> 15:06.824
Oh, that's so sweet.

15:06.908 --> 15:10.119
It must be easy with no dirty,
broken woman in the relationship.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.165
What are you laughing at?

15:14.248 --> 15:17.043
Okay. Everybody follow
the birthday flag.

15:17.126 --> 15:19.087
What'd you call me?
Oh, the- Uh, yes.

15:19.170 --> 15:21.964
Oh, my gosh. it's so elegant.
Pepper must be dying.

15:22.048 --> 15:24.550
Oh, you know, actually, Pepper
couldn't come because he hates boats.

15:24.675 --> 15:27.053
You know, after the navy, so- Oh.
Oh, yeah.

15:27.136 --> 15:30.139
Oh, I guess Longines
got over his fear of water.

15:30.223 --> 15:34.310
No, no. Why don't we just focus on the 30
people who are here having a great time?

15:34.393 --> 15:37.230
Eee! Smells like
somebody's dead.

15:37.313 --> 15:39.023
What is that smell?

15:39.107 --> 15:41.692
That faint odor is-
is a tiny, tiny blue whale,

15:41.776 --> 15:44.487
who apparently has indeed died,
uh, nearby.

15:44.612 --> 15:47.865
But- Yeah, but it's
getting all over my coat.

15:47.949 --> 15:51.744
I don't smell anything. Maybe that's because
you smell like a bouquet of flower-

15:51.869 --> 15:53.663
Ow!
Oh, yeah.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.373
Watch out for that.

15:55.498 --> 15:59.252
It smells like puke married
poop and had the ceremony in my nose.

15:59.377 --> 16:01.963
You paint with words.
Okay. Don't worry, everybody.

16:02.046 --> 16:05.133
Soon we'll be way, way out at
sea, bouncing on the waves...

16:05.216 --> 16:07.426
with all of his sweet-smelling
brothers and sisters, okay?

16:07.552 --> 16:09.095
Mitchell Pritchett?
Oh, yes. Hi.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.013
Hi. I'm your captain tonight.
We've got a problem.

16:11.097 --> 16:12.849
I can't fit
this many people on my boat.

16:12.932 --> 16:15.685
No, no. I was told you could take 30.
I have exactly 30 guests.

16:15.768 --> 16:18.479
Plus six in help.
You gotta drop a few people.

16:18.563 --> 16:20.773
Come on. There must be
something that we can do here.

16:20.857 --> 16:24.110
Well, we have bigger boats, but this is
the best I could do on two hours' notice.

16:24.235 --> 16:25.903
Uh-
What is the problem?

16:25.987 --> 16:28.656
Apparently Mitchell started planning
my birthday party two hours ago.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.825
Mm-mmm.
No, no. I-I-I did not.

16:30.908 --> 16:34.328
Uh, apparently we have too
many people for his boat, so-

16:34.412 --> 16:38.040
That's crazy. I've seen more people
clinging to a floating door.

16:38.124 --> 16:39.750
I'm sorry, lady.
it's a safety issue.

16:39.834 --> 16:42.003
Oh, no, you're going to have
a safety issue...

16:42.086 --> 16:44.255
if you don't take me away
from this whale.

16:44.338 --> 16:47.175
- Okay, a little too much finger, a little
too much attitude. -What's all this?

16:47.258 --> 16:49.635
Two hours of Mitchell's
hard work going down the drain.

16:49.719 --> 16:52.722
Look, I can't fit
more than 30 people on the boat,

16:52.805 --> 16:54.682
as I was just explaining
to the lady here.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.642
Well, first of all,
that lady is my son.

16:56.726 --> 16:59.562
- He wasn't- He wasn't talking about me.
- I was talking about her.

16:59.645 --> 17:03.065
Oh, her. Oh, it's “her” now.
Well, “her” happens to be my wife.

17:03.149 --> 17:05.526
You got a problem with her,
you got a problem with me.

17:05.609 --> 17:07.694
No, no, Jay, calm down.

17:07.778 --> 17:10.031
I didn't have a problem before,
but now I'm starting to.

17:10.114 --> 17:12.074
No, your problem is about
to get a lot bigger.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.785
No, Jay. I know you think this
is what I want, but it's not.

17:14.911 --> 17:18.497
I got this, Gloria. No, Jay, I
was just being stupid today.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.501
I like that you're calm, that you
think first and you act second.

17:22.585 --> 17:24.337
I need that in my life.

17:24.420 --> 17:25.963
Yeah.
So walk away, Grandpa.

17:26.047 --> 17:27.173
You know what-

17:27.256 --> 17:29.717
Nobody calls him Grandpa!

17:29.800 --> 17:32.386
I do.
Okay, that's it.

17:32.470 --> 17:35.348
No boat. Everybody off my dock,
or I'm calling the cops.

17:35.473 --> 17:37.725
Wait, wait. So no party now?
No, no, of course.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.685
Just- Just give me
a minute, okay?

17:39.769 --> 17:43.147
Well, after what you did with two hours, I
can't wait to see what you do with a minute.

17:43.231 --> 17:44.732
Cam-

17:44.815 --> 17:47.068
Poor Cam.
He seems so upset.

17:47.151 --> 17:50.154
Oh, is that hard for you, Phil? That
he's having a feeling around you?

17:50.279 --> 17:51.948
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Too many emotions?

17:52.031 --> 17:53.991
Okay, okay, I give up!

17:54.825 --> 17:56.786
Yeah, I made a mistake today.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.080
But only because the three
of you ganged up on me,

17:59.163 --> 18:02.750
like when the Wolf Man, Dracula and
Frankenstein show up in the same movie,

18:02.833 --> 18:05.378
except this wasn't awesome!

18:05.461 --> 18:08.464
I have been on an emotional
roller coaster all day today.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.508
I'm afraid. I'm mad.
I'm mad because I'm afraid.

18:10.633 --> 18:14.220
Now I can't even think straight because I'm in
so much pain from what just happened over there.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.973
And the whole thing makes me so
sad, and I'm not even sure why,

18:17.056 --> 18:19.725
and I'm nauseous from that smell,
but I'm so hungry.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.814
Yeah.

18:26.065 --> 18:28.609
Cam, the-the boat wasn't
even part of the plan.

18:28.693 --> 18:31.862
No, it's fine. it's my fault for
letting my expectations get too high.

18:31.946 --> 18:33.698
I'll get over this one too.

18:33.781 --> 18:36.367
No, no, I had this whole
Wizard of Oz party planned,

18:36.450 --> 18:39.870
only today I realized that it
might be a little too tornado-y.

18:39.996 --> 18:41.580
Today?
Yes. I'm sorry.

18:41.664 --> 18:43.207
I didn't make
the connection, okay?

18:43.291 --> 18:45.293
Probably 'cause I've been
planning for months...

18:45.376 --> 18:47.670
so that you could have the
perfect party and be happy,

18:47.753 --> 18:49.547
which now I don't even
think is possible.

18:49.630 --> 18:53.384
Oh, I'm sorry that I would like to
have a nice 10th birthday party.

18:53.467 --> 18:57.888
Well, you can't have it, Cam. You
want to know why? Because you're 40!

18:57.972 --> 19:00.224
You're a 40-year-old man!

19:03.060 --> 19:04.895
I am 40.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.358
I'm 40.
Yes.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.154
Okay, stop it.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.614
I'm 40,
and I'm on this stupid-

19:15.698 --> 19:19.201
Wait, what is that?
What is this... thing?

19:19.285 --> 19:23.914
Suddenly it all made sense. Cam's
craziness all day wasn't about a party.

19:23.998 --> 19:27.668
It was about turning 40.
And once he realized that,

19:27.752 --> 19:29.712
everything got much worse.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.839
I've done nothing
with my life!

19:31.922 --> 19:34.508
What? Stop it. Come on.
How can you say that?

19:34.592 --> 19:39.221
You're a wonderful father. You-
You graduated from clown college.

19:39.305 --> 19:41.098
You've been to France.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.352
I don't want to be 40. it's not fair.
I know.

19:44.435 --> 19:46.228
Nothing's fair.

19:46.354 --> 19:51.609
Two miles from here is an amusement park full
of happy families swinging on a trapeze.

19:51.692 --> 19:54.528
That's all I wanted
for my special bonus day.

19:57.907 --> 19:59.742
What?

19:59.825 --> 20:02.787
I'd been trying so hard to figure out
what Cam wanted for his birthday.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.207
He'd been telling me all along.

20:06.290 --> 20:08.125
He wanted to be 10.

20:08.209 --> 20:10.669
Whoo!

20:12.380 --> 20:14.465
Whoo!

20:18.386 --> 20:20.513
Seriously?
There's nothing you can do?

20:20.596 --> 20:22.431
I'm sorry.
You just missed the cutoff.

20:22.515 --> 20:24.517
How about
we see you next time?

20:24.600 --> 20:27.937
How about you make an exception
and strap him in there?

20:28.020 --> 20:30.147
Yeah, we're like 10 minutes
past your deadline anyways.

20:30.231 --> 20:31.774
And you don't want to
make us angry today.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.901
Ladies, I really can't- “Ladies”?
No, no, no.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.529
Seriously?

20:38.614 --> 20:41.992
And that was how
they apologized to me.

20:42.118 --> 20:44.328
- Whoo!
- Come on, Phil!

20:44.453 --> 20:45.538
Go, Dad! Oh!

20:45.621 --> 20:47.331
Go, Phil!

20:47.415 --> 20:49.875
Go, Daddy!

20:49.959 --> 20:53.337
At least I- I think it was.
I could never ask them.

20:56.382 --> 20:59.093
This is so satisfying!

20:59.176 --> 21:00.761
Best I've felt
all day!

21:02.847 --> 21:05.975
Can I rent one of these
on a monthly basis?

21:07.852 --> 21:09.228
Yeah!
Yes!

21:09.311 --> 21:11.105
Oh, yay!

21:11.188 --> 21:12.440
Oh!

21:12.523 --> 21:14.108
Best 40th birthday party ever.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.026
No, no. Tenth.

21:16.152 --> 21:17.820
Really?
Yeah.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.405
In fact, you're still
that sexy little...

21:19.488 --> 21:21.407
eight-year-old
I fell in love with.

21:24.535 --> 21:27.663
Oh, um- No, just go.

21:32.543 --> 21:33.544
