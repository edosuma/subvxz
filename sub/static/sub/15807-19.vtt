¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.240 --> 00:08.307
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.376 --> 00:12.710
¶ That started from this tropic
port aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.779 --> 00:15.346
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailing man ¶

00:15.415 --> 00:17.549
¶ The skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:20.052
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.121 --> 00:25.156
¶ For a three hour tour,
    a three hour tour ¶

00:25.225 --> 00:27.258
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.327 --> 00:29.394
¶ The weather
    started getting rough ¶

00:29.463 --> 00:31.697
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.765 --> 00:34.366
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.435 --> 00:36.401
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.737
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.806 --> 00:40.605
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.375
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

00:43.444 --> 00:46.010

[jungle boy screaming]

01:29.256 --> 01:30.688
Who's there?

01:30.757 --> 01:33.425
Maybe it's a man-eating lion
  or hungry tiger.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.329
But lions and tigers aren't
 on deserted islands. Are you?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.373
[repeated kissing]

01:50.811 --> 01:52.377
It's a boy!

01:55.349 --> 01:56.648
It's a jungle boy!

01:56.717 --> 01:58.717
Wait, no, wait. Kid, wait, wait,
take it easy now.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.919
Wait, wait, don't go away now,
 please, please.

02:00.987 --> 02:03.388
[hooting]

02:03.456 --> 02:06.725
Wait for me, kid!
       Wait for me!

02:06.793 --> 02:10.662
Hey, wait for me. Don't go away,
kid. Here I come, kid!

02:10.729 --> 02:13.165
[hooting]

02:30.617 --> 02:34.452
Ah. Professor, that works great.
Just like a regular fan.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.555
Better. You don't get bills from
the electric company each month.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.690
Yeah! Why don't you
             get it patented?

02:38.759 --> 02:40.258
I wrote to Washington,
but I don't think

02:40.326 --> 02:41.759
the bottle ever got there.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.562
Skipper! Skipper, Skipper.
   You should've seen him.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.363
Swinging from tree to tree.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.632
- Who, Gilligan, who?
     - A jungle boy.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.235
One minute he was there, then he
was gone. Then he was back.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.604
I'm glad he got back.
    I was beginning to miss him.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.039
There's a boy out there,
honest, Skipper.

02:54.107 --> 02:58.443
Oh, Gilligan. Me, Tarzan.
       You, Jane. Him, boy.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.911
The boy's about this tall,
   kind of hard to tell.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.479
He's always swinging
      through the trees.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.915
Gilligan, once and for all,
     I have had it!

03:03.984 --> 03:06.651
- Had what?
   - Your fantastic stories.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.353
Are you sure
      it wasn't a monkey?

03:08.422 --> 03:11.723
A monkey is real short and has
hair all over it and goes..

03:11.791 --> 03:13.125
[hooting]

03:13.193 --> 03:16.127
Well, Gilligan, I've never
      seen you look so natural.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.964
Now we've searched this island,
and there is nobody else here.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.766
He's out there, I can prove it.
Just follow me.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.935
I do not believe you. This time,
I gonna make you admit that

03:24.004 --> 03:26.104
you don't believe you either.

03:26.172 --> 03:29.507
Huh?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.510
This is where I found him.
 I think he lives in that tree.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.478
Well, why don't we knock on
 the tree and see if he's home.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.914
Skipper, I saw him honest.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.549
He was right on this spot
       a little while ago.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.086
Well, obviously he's not here
now, so let's go back.

03:41.155 --> 03:44.690
Wait a minute, honest, Skipper.
I saw him. Boy! Oh, boy!

03:47.127 --> 03:48.327
There he is.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.929
[bird chirping]

03:53.033 --> 03:55.533
Gilligan, you didn't tell me
that he had feathers.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.335
Honest. I just saw him.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.205
Boy. Oh, boy.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.608
I hear him.
         I hear him. I hear him.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.878
He's back in the tree.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.296
Gilligan, that wasn't
even a boy bird!

04:34.541 --> 04:36.475
[repeated kissing]

04:36.543 --> 04:38.410
Don't do that,
    I know you're not there.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.147
Well, where were you
when I needed you?

04:42.216 --> 04:44.616
- Skipper.
           - Skipper.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.352
- Anybody.
           - Anybody.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.253
- Don't do that.
        - Don't do that.

04:49.322 --> 04:50.889
What do you know,
       Little Sir Echo.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.660
(Gilligan)
Huh? No, look I don't
have time to play catch.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.529
Look, I got to take
you back to camp.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.665
Come back with me to camp.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.769
Do you understand?
   No, you don't understand.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.671
Listen, you know, come back..

05:06.740 --> 05:10.341
'No, we're not going
  to get any place this way.'

05:10.410 --> 05:11.810
You want to play
       follow the leader?

05:11.879 --> 05:15.080
Okay, five minutes, then I got
to get back to camp, okay?

05:18.385 --> 05:19.851
'Hey, kid wait, for me.'

05:19.919 --> 05:21.586
[yodeling]

05:36.036 --> 05:36.768
[air hissing]

05:36.837 --> 05:38.403
Watch it.
           Look out!

05:38.472 --> 05:40.706
What's that?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.809
[hissing continues]

06:22.215 --> 06:24.682
Wait till Skipper sees this
  and wait till he sees you.

06:24.751 --> 06:29.321
Give me the rock, and I'll cap
it. No, the rock. See, the rock.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.056
Thanks.<i> Thanks..</i>

06:32.693 --> 06:35.059
Alright, come on,
let's go back to camp.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.128
You know, follow the leader?
Remember? Follow the leader?

06:37.197 --> 06:38.829
Remember? This way, come on.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.499
[laughs]

06:42.702 --> 06:44.535
How much longer, Mary Ann?

06:44.604 --> 06:46.638
We're almost
to the rinse cycle, Skipper.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.873
Sometimes, I think the professor
invents too many things.

06:48.941 --> 06:51.108
¶ Ha, ho! This is the way
   we wash our clothes ¶

06:51.177 --> 06:52.944
¶ Wash our clothes
       Wash our clothes ¶

06:53.013 --> 06:54.445
¶ This is the way
     we wash our clothes ¶

06:54.514 --> 06:57.015
¶ So early in the morning ¶

06:57.084 --> 07:00.685
Mr. Howell, would you like it
if I put you in the driver seat?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.188
Sir, are you suggesting
   that I stoop to manual labor?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.824
Congratulations!
You got it right the first time.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.093
Would you ask a man
   with a chronic sacroiliac

07:08.161 --> 07:10.695
and a strangulated disk
    to do a thing like that?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.131
- You got all those things?
  - Don't evade the issue.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.711
- Alright, Gilligan.
      - I made it.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.713
Come on, Frank Bucks,
     stand up straight.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.749
- You got to help me, Skipper.
 - It's no use.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.885
The Skipper is an enemy
    of medical science.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.355
His back is fine. It's his head
 I'm worried about.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.890
Still having those
              hallucinations?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.526
Nope! Found the jungle boy,
found a gas that floats things.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.994
We played around and came back.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.797
- A jungle boy?
- Yes. Like the one over there.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.232
Gilligan, if you say
  jungle boy once more I'll..

07:48.301 --> 07:49.968
A jungle boy!

07:50.037 --> 07:52.236
- He said it. I didn't.
    - You did?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.772
Well, obviously since
     there is a jungle boy.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.941
How about you, Mary Ann.
        Do you see it too?

07:57.010 --> 08:01.145
It's not an it, Skipper.
It is a boy. It's a jungle boy.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.683
And I suppose that if I turn
    around, I'll see it too.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.555
I see it! Come on, Gilligan,
  let's grab him.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.123
- No, Skipper, don't.
     - Why not?

08:12.191 --> 08:14.659
He swings like a monkey, swims
like a fish, runs like a deer.

08:14.728 --> 08:18.163
- I don't want that again.
- One attribute I have is charm.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.432
Children simply adore me. They
 think of me as a rich uncle.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.734
Yes. Come here, jungle boy.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.670
'Uncle Thurston Howell III
   would like'

08:25.739 --> 08:28.806
'to leave you a little
    something in his will.'

08:28.875 --> 08:31.076
Come here, boy,
   and that's an order! Heel!

08:31.144 --> 08:34.044
Mr. Howell. That wouldn't
even work on a cobra.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.649
Cobras indeed, the boy obviously
has gone to the wrong school.

08:39.952 --> 08:40.986
Hi.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.955
Come on, honey.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.692
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.629
Come on.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.605
I say she's charmed
the little nipper.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.940
How'd you do that, Mary Ann?

09:02.008 --> 09:05.142
When fishing for boys,
the proper bait is girls.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.479
Good work. Maybe he can tell us
how to get off the island.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.014
How long have you been here?

09:10.082 --> 09:13.150
'How close are we to Hawaii?
How can we get off this island''

09:13.219 --> 09:14.753
Is-land?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.588
No, you don't seem
to understand.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.722
Now, you tell your
uncle Thurston how to get off

09:18.791 --> 09:20.324
this ridiculous island
and when we get back

09:20.393 --> 09:24.162
I'll give you a substantial
reward like matched luggage.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.864
Lug-gage?

09:25.932 --> 09:27.932
I don't think he understands
what you're saying.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.768
Say-ing.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.368
Maybe he has some information
   that'll help us

09:31.437 --> 09:33.138
get off the island.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.840
We've got to all try
       and communicate with him.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.208
Come on, young fella..

09:37.277 --> 09:38.276
[clamoring]

09:38.345 --> 09:39.945
I won't declare.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.415
- 'What's your name?'
     - Name.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.583
No, let me try it, huh?

09:45.651 --> 09:48.186
Since I'm not doing
             any good.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.321
Mary Ann.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.422
- Mary Ann.
          - No, no.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.757
No, no.

09:52.825 --> 09:55.226
I'm afraid we'll have
to start with the basics.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.695
Girl.
Boy.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.697
Girl.
             Boy.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.066
Girl.
                           Boy.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.736
Girl.
         Boy, boy, boy!

10:06.005 --> 10:08.406
Oh, dear, I do wish
I paid more attention

10:08.474 --> 10:10.208
to those Tarzan pictures.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.544
Got to make you
               look presentable.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.714
Y-your hair is
                  just a mess.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.919
Hm. I guess we better
     let you look like you.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.790
There. Here,
      see how you like it.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.327
[screaming]

10:33.433 --> 10:38.769
First things first, little boy.
 And the first thing is manners.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.039
- Manners.
           - Right.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.809
That means the fork
    or spoon on the outside

10:44.878 --> 10:46.778
is the one that you use first.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.880
Like this.

11:01.694 --> 11:05.130
No, Lovey, no.
        Definitely not.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.664
Thurston.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.034
No, Lovey, you can ask
a man just so much.

11:10.102 --> 11:13.038
But it's the only way I can
     get him out of the tree.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.706
No, dear, no.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.441
Well, alright, Thurston,
        if you say so.

11:17.510 --> 11:22.180
But after all, you're
       a great big grown-up man.

11:22.248 --> 11:26.751
- And he's just a little boy.
 - Well, alright.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.460
- 'I'm afraid he'll fall out.'
 - 'Oh, he's right at home.'

11:36.529 --> 11:37.929
He'll be alright.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.833
In New Port beach, one doesn't
sleep out in the backyard.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.267
Mrs. Howell, he's probably
      been sleeping

11:43.336 --> 11:45.837
'like that since he was
         this big.'

11:51.311 --> 11:53.077
[air hissing]

11:53.146 --> 11:55.513
Here, now watch this.
     Ready, go.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.448
[all laugh]

11:57.517 --> 12:00.585
I don't understand this, but I
 have to admit you were right.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.353
It's really something, huh?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.522
It appears to be both
odorless and colorless.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.990
You can't see it or smell it.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.892
Isn't that what I just said?

12:07.960 --> 12:11.562
(Skipper)
  'Oh, never mind, Professor.
  Young Tom Edison, you know.'

12:11.631 --> 12:13.998
Because of its buoyant
qualities, I'd say it's either

12:14.066 --> 12:16.834
hydrogen or helium
or a combination of both gases

12:16.903 --> 12:18.269
and or their properties.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.036
I agree completely.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.438
What do you mean
                you agree?

12:20.507 --> 12:22.039
You didn't understand
           what he said.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.509
Right. So that's why
I should agree.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.913
Don't they use helium
     to blow up dirigibles

12:28.982 --> 12:30.381
and balloons and all that..

12:30.450 --> 12:32.383
Did someone say there's
    helium on this island?

12:32.451 --> 12:34.118
Helium or hydrogen.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.021
What an opportunity. I can see
it now. I'll form a new company.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.056
Howell's Helium and
     Hydrogen Corporation.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.159
Please, Mr. Howell, we've got
important problems to solve.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.061
Oh, what's more important than
 money? Oh, I can see it now.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.297
I'll put it up in fifths,
   quarts, magnums.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.067
And before I'm through, I'll
 have the whole country gassed.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.402
What an issue, it floats.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.804
[everybody laughs]

12:53.974 --> 12:55.807
'You know what we're gonna do?'

12:55.876 --> 12:57.875
We're gonna use that gas
to inflate a balloon

12:57.944 --> 13:00.044
and float one of us
to civilization.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.048
Professor, there's a place for a
man like you in my organization.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.051
- I'll take my hat off to you.
 - Professor, me too.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.761
The professor's a genius.
   Just a few hours ago

13:16.830 --> 13:19.364
this contraption was
      a washing machine.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.932
And now, it's a sewing machine.
I hope it works.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.301
Sure it will.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.169
Soon as we sew
    those raincoats together

13:25.237 --> 13:27.204
the professor seals them
  with sap from a rubber tree

13:27.273 --> 13:28.639
we'll have our own
       Island Airlines

13:28.708 --> 13:30.475
'leaving from gate number one.'

13:30.543 --> 13:32.943
- Coffee, tea, or milk?
    - Coffee, tea, or milk?

13:33.012 --> 13:35.046
I'm practicing
      to be a stewardess.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.819
- Well, here I am. Last load.
- Where are the other raincoats?

13:40.887 --> 13:43.288
Ah, they're underneath,
    it was easier to carry.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.862
- Whose raincoat is that?
   - Oh, it's mine.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.331
It shrunk during the rain.

13:59.538 --> 14:01.505
Ah, she's holding
     the helium very well.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.141
This is going to work out
   better than I expected.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.511
Looks like a trench coat
        for an octopus.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.479
Gilligan, you make sure
those lines are secure.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.049
'I don't want it to float away
 before she's ready.'

14:11.117 --> 14:12.884
Make the other end
            of this line secure.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.219
Yes, sir.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.289
Gilligan, may I have
            my end of the line?

14:23.162 --> 14:26.731
You got the short end. You
should've the long end like me.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.300
What are you, some kind
         of a knot or something?

14:30.803 --> 14:33.137
Well, give me some line.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.439
Alright, Gilligan,
       secure the line.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.076
[screaming]

14:38.744 --> 14:40.345
My finger.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.349
Ah, Mr. Howell. How you
    doing with the basket?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.617
If I'd known the ballast
    was gonna be this heavy

14:46.686 --> 14:50.955
I wouldn't have volunteered
 for the job. Uh-uh, Professor.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.659
'Skipper, come here a moment.
 I-I have a brilliant idea!'

14:54.727 --> 14:57.495
Get around the other side where
 you can see what you're doing.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.064
Aye, aye, sir.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.467
Why don't we tie the provisions
on instead of the ballast?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.503
That way we'll be killing
two birds with one rope.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.931
Speaking of minds,
              where is Gilligan?

15:33.999 --> 15:36.668
[snake charming music]

15:36.736 --> 15:38.569
He's inside the balloon. C'mon.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.277
(Professor)
    Wait a minute, skip.
    Let me cap this Helium.

15:50.683 --> 15:54.385
- Got you. Got a foot skipper?
 - Yeah.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.528
Come down out
             of there, Gilligan.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.231
Oh, by George, that boy.
    Watch it.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.369
Duck your head, that's it.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.708
- To the left.
  - Goodness sakes, Gilligan.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.644
How do you do these things!

16:24.350 --> 16:26.551
Now let's put him on that
     rock over there, Professor.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.490
Now stay right there
        and stay out of trouble!

16:33.559 --> 16:37.528
Let's check that balloon.
See if he did any damage.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.461
(Skipper)
'Gilligan, come down here.
We've got a lot of work to do.'

17:15.367 --> 17:17.300
I'm going back up again.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.039
Only one thing I can think of.
  That artificial respiration

17:22.108 --> 17:24.107
just squeezed the helium
        out of him.

17:24.175 --> 17:26.910
You mean like this?

17:26.979 --> 17:29.047
[exhaling air]

17:33.586 --> 17:36.186
Are you alright, little buddy?
Did I hurt you?

17:36.255 --> 17:39.123
Next time, lets
       just shake hands!

17:39.192 --> 17:41.325
(Skipper)
   'I still say, I'm the one
   who goes in the balloon.'

17:41.394 --> 17:42.926
(Professor)
      'I thought we agreed
      to use logic.'

17:42.995 --> 17:45.696
(Skipper)
      'It's logical for
      the captain to go.'

17:45.765 --> 17:48.365
(Mr. Howell)
'Well, I'm the richest man here,
and I have something to say.'

17:48.434 --> 17:51.569
- What kind of logic is that.
 - The best logic, money.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.271
Gentlemen, we got
to reach a decision!

17:53.339 --> 17:55.706
It's a cinch you three
          can't go up there.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.741
- Well, I know navigation.
   - I know air currents.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.411
And I know the presidents
   of five major airlines.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.546
- I know, I'm not going up.
  - What do you mean?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.315
It'll be comfortable with Ginger
as the stewardess

18:04.384 --> 18:06.817
the skipper as the pilot,
  the professor as navigator.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.419
I'll be more than comfortable.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.522
I wish you'd listen. Only one
person can go in this balloon!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.758
One person? No bubbly?
     No movies?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.593
Oh, my God, that's
       a tourist flight!

18:15.661 --> 18:18.195
- Exactly!
 - Exactly, then count me out!

18:18.264 --> 18:19.663
Skipper, then it's between
      you and me.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.032
- Why not draw straws?
   - Of all the stupid ideas.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.234
Why's it stupid?

18:24.303 --> 18:26.303
Why did you say
it was stupid, Gilligan?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.139
- But Skipper..
   - I as holding the straws!

18:28.207 --> 18:30.341
- Oh, no! No, you won't!
    - No, no, no.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.411
I just happen to have two straws
see! The short one goes.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.346
Good enough? Good Enough?
   There you are.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.215
- Ready?
            - Ready.

18:39.585 --> 18:46.257
I won, I won, I won!
   Ha ha ha. I won...I think.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.528
Remember to call
my broker, alright?

18:51.597 --> 18:53.464
- The minute I land, Mr. Howell.
- Alright.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.232
And you'll call my agent?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.134
Got his number
      right in my pocket.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.603
Don't forget to send
            somebody back.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.871
Gilligan, that's why
      I'm going, remember?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.306
Sure, I remember. I just
        hope you don't forget.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.243
- 'Everybody, listen.'
     - Uh, roger.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.211
That's Air Force talk,
          wild blue yonder.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.613
- Oh, roger!
 - I'll control the guide line.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.315
That'll get the balloon
         clear of the foliage

19:11.384 --> 19:12.950
and make sure he's headed
       in the right direction.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.286
If you land in London, mention
 my name to the royal family.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.489
They'll put you up.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.490
You and Mr. Howell
     steady the side lines.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.593
'Be ready to let go
      when I yell.'

19:22.662 --> 19:23.627
Roger.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.963
Gilligan, cast off
       that side line.

19:26.032 --> 19:31.469
(Professor)
 'I'll start the countdown.
 Five, four, three, two, one.'

19:36.809 --> 19:38.409
I guess it's still
     too heavy, Professor.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.179
I'll throw off
       a little ballast.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.151
Good luck, Skipper.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.253
(together)
         'Bon voyage.'

19:55.228 --> 19:56.860
Pull the balloon back down!

19:56.929 --> 19:59.530
We haven't six claws,
     I mean really, Lovey.

19:59.599 --> 20:03.601
I can't stand a...unsuccessful..

20:05.338 --> 20:07.638
Our first experiment
      was perfect.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.207
Except, of course,
     for one minor detail.

20:10.276 --> 20:12.376
- It failed.
          - I know.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.945
But that's just because
   the cargo was overweight.

20:15.013 --> 20:16.646
That's you, Skipper.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.283
Quiet, the professor's trying
to explain something to us.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.617
Go ahead, Professor.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.420
So with the
   weight problem eliminated

20:22.488 --> 20:24.555
everything else has
   worked out scientifically.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.690
I've computed the cross-Pacific
air currents

20:26.758 --> 20:29.760
the rotation of the Earth,
   our latitude and longitude

20:29.828 --> 20:32.062
and the jet stream which
    goes directly to Hawaii.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.630
He wore out two whole pencils.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.033
The balloon has to rise
         to a height of 300 feet

20:36.102 --> 20:37.568
'to catch the air currents.'

20:37.636 --> 20:39.870
Which means it can carry
        20 pounds of provisions

20:39.939 --> 20:42.939
or 90 pounds of human cargo
     with complete safety.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.941
Ninety pounds?

20:45.010 --> 20:46.443
Oh, no, you don't.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.612
We-we'll give
             the lad flight pay.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.914
Oh, I assure you,
       he'll be completely safe.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.483
'We can put a note in his pocket
explaining our situation.'

20:53.552 --> 20:55.352
Professor's got a point.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.621
You can't send that
             boy up in a crate.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.523
She's got a good point too.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.259
Well, it'll sail itself.
  There's no navigation problem.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.629
You got a good point too.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.165
Aren't you suppose to test
these things or something?

21:08.234 --> 21:09.499
Mrs. Howell's got a good point.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.402
The flight will make
            the lad famous.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.003
Mr. Howell's got
a good point too.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.239
Gilligan, not everyone
          can have a good point.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.941
You don't have to agree
         with everyone.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.744
You know something, Skipper?
You got a good point too.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.213
Besides, I don't see why anybody
should go up in that balloon.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.685
We have to put a rescue note in
it and let it go up by itself.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.120
(everyone)
     Gilligan, good point.
     Great idea.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.023
(Professor)
    'Absolutely wonderful.'

21:56.982 --> 21:59.015
I put everything I could think
 of into this rescue note.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.618
So did I, as we know about
   longitude and latitude.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.121
And I offered a generous
        reward for our rescue.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.824
I knew you would, Lovey. My note
reads, double previous offer.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.594
Skipper, Professor, the boy
  is gone! He's disappeared.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.930
Maybe he went to where he used
to live to get a few things!

22:12.999 --> 22:14.932
What'd he have,
             a formal loincloth?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.700
- I wonder.
       - You wonder what?

22:16.769 --> 22:20.471
Well, he knew we were talking
about him and the balloon.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.941
- Oh, no, he wouldn't do that.
 - Oh.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.645
'The balloon is gone,
     it's gone!'

22:28.714 --> 22:30.247
Is it caught
in the trees anywhere?

22:30.315 --> 22:31.582
It's terrible.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.750
Oh, he sure must have used
   a sharp knife!

22:33.819 --> 22:36.786
- These are cut clean through.
 - Oh, that poor boy.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.856
I assure you, Mrs. Howell,
   he'll be perfectly safe.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.791
Not only that,
           we'll all be rescued!

22:40.859 --> 22:42.626
Because when they find him,
     he'll tell 'em about us.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.363
He'll tell 'em about the island.
He'll tell 'em to send a boat..

22:45.431 --> 22:48.498
Gilligan. How is he
             going to tell them?

22:48.567 --> 22:53.704
He'll just say, boy-boy,
    girl-girl...no-no.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.846
Gilligan, I keep telling you
  it was not your fault!

23:02.914 --> 23:05.315
- Yeah, but I found him.
  - We'd found him eventually.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.817
How 'bout the helium?

23:06.886 --> 23:09.653
Gilligan, if there is any blame,
we should all share it.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.389
We knew he was listening
  when we were talking about it.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.158
(man on radio)
     'Ladies and gentlemen,
     we interrupt'

23:14.226 --> 23:18.195
'our regularly scheduled program
for a special announcement.'

23:18.264 --> 23:19.796
- Shh.
    - I didn't say anything.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.032
Well, you were just
             about to, now shh.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.868
(man on radio)
'A most miraculous
and unusual event has happened''

23:24.937 --> 23:28.038
'An unidentified boy
in a balloon made of raincoats'

23:28.106 --> 23:31.208
'has landed on the deck of a
United States aircraft carrier''

23:31.277 --> 23:37.915
- He made it! Hey, everybody!
 - He made it! Everybody!

23:37.983 --> 23:40.384
- What is that? What is that?
 - Listen.

23:40.453 --> 23:43.887
(man on radio)
  'Of course, the mystery will
  remain with us for years'

23:43.956 --> 23:46.256
'for it will take that long
  to find out who he is'

23:46.324 --> 23:49.926
'or where he came from
 since all he can do is mimic.'

23:49.995 --> 23:53.163
- He could use a fork.
  - Why, he can comb his hair.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.699
(man on radio)
   'Obviously, he didn't
   make the balloon himself.'

23:55.768 --> 23:58.068
The boy's a pilot,
              not an inventor.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.338
- 'He had help but whom?'
   - Who.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.141
(man on radio)
  'So far, all we've been able
  to get out of him is'

24:04.210 --> 24:07.912
'boy-boy, girl-girl, no-no.'

24:07.980 --> 24:10.080
That's about all they'll
        ever get out of him too.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.349
After he grows up and goes
to school and college

24:12.417 --> 24:13.917
he'll be able
to talk real good.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.687
- But that'll be ten years.
  - Anything else, Gilligan?

24:17.756 --> 24:21.859
Mm-hmm. You, Skipper.
    Him, Professor. Me, nut.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.770
¶ Now this is the tale
     of our castaways ¶

24:33.839 --> 24:35.839
¶ They're here
     for a long long time ¶

24:35.908 --> 24:38.408
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:38.477 --> 24:40.110
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:40.179 --> 24:42.312
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

24:42.381 --> 24:44.414
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:44.483 --> 24:46.683
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

24:46.752 --> 24:48.852
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

24:48.921 --> 24:50.887
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

24:50.956 --> 24:53.256
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

24:53.325 --> 24:55.425
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

24:55.494 --> 24:57.361
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

24:57.429 --> 24:59.729
¶ So join us here each
     week my friends ¶

24:59.798 --> 25:01.732
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:01.801 --> 25:04.468
¶ For seven stranded castaways ¶

25:04.537 --> 25:06.871
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

25:07.305 --> 25:13.903
