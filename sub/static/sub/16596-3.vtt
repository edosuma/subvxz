♪♪

00:09.777 --> 00:12.344
Happy Halloween, BOOMS!

00:12.346 --> 00:18.417
Or as Falcon calls it...
party time!

00:18.853 --> 00:23.222
Halloween is our favorite
holiday. We love dressing up
and scaring the snot

00:23.224 --> 00:25.290
out of our friends.

00:25.292 --> 00:29.061
Christmas may have cheer,
but Halloween has fear.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.195
And candy!

00:30.197 --> 00:33.365
But that doesn't rhyme,
that doesn't-- I'm sorry.

00:33.367 --> 00:37.569
No way. You guys
actually dressed up
for Halloween?

00:37.571 --> 00:40.406
That's so cute!

00:40.408 --> 00:42.808
We don't do that at BOOMS.

00:42.810 --> 00:46.211
But you are killing it
in that falcon costume, Falcon.

00:46.213 --> 00:51.283
I prefer the term "slaying it,"
but... I'll accept that.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.020
What do you mean
you don't dress up here?

00:55.022 --> 00:57.322
Those guys are dressed up
like a biohazard team.

00:59.393 --> 01:03.128
Because they are
a biohazard team.

01:04.999 --> 01:10.169
Stay away from Mataya's locker.
Her biology experiment
went out of control.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.573
Why are you dressed as a foot?

01:14.575 --> 01:19.244
It's Halloween,
and there's nothing scarier
than a dirty foot comin' at ya!

01:19.246 --> 01:20.913
Fear the fungus!

01:22.716 --> 01:25.918
Parker, you're seriously
into Halloween?

01:25.920 --> 01:29.755
I'm shocked. I thought
you were a man of science.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.925
I'm also a man of awesomeness!

01:32.927 --> 01:35.194
And Halloween is awesome.

01:35.196 --> 01:39.698
We don't do trick-or-treating.
But we do have a study session
to get ready for midterms.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.403
It's an all-night party
on the fun train.

01:44.405 --> 01:49.541
No offense, but when you're
as smart as we are, Halloween's
just a silly holiday.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.312
What? It's the holiday
for frights and terrors.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.248
You gotta admit,
being scared is fun.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.284
I will not. But you know
what is fun?

01:59.286 --> 02:03.489
Prepping my ant farm
for space travel!

02:03.491 --> 02:04.756
(bell rings)

02:04.758 --> 02:06.291
I'll race you to knowledge!

02:11.098 --> 02:12.598
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.667
That we ditch our costumes
and try our best to fit in?

02:15.669 --> 02:21.473
No... no.
That we show Val how much fun
being scared can be.

02:22.843 --> 02:27.613
Falcon and Parker...
Defending the honor
of Halloween.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.415
Don't do the Falcon voice
when it's just you and me.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.521
I'm sorry--
I'm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

it's the tooth fairy's job

03:39.520 --> 03:41.420
to keep the candy bowl full.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.155
Oh... why's that?

03:43.157 --> 03:44.823
It's really good job security.

03:46.727 --> 03:51.396
SkyVolt is here!
I'm ready to take on Zaydock!

03:51.398 --> 03:56.668
Dr. Rooney says
diagnosis... awesome!

03:56.670 --> 04:00.606
Well, from one SkyVolt
to another, let me just say

04:00.608 --> 04:02.374
that you look amazing
in that suit.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.610
This is gonna be
such a great Halloween.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.412
Let me write you a prescription
for some ghoulish fun.

04:07.414 --> 04:11.617
Okay... so Mom?
No more doctor jokes.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.584
Got it.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.854
I got it. Time of death, 4:37.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.425
Oh, Karen and Maddie,
thank you so much

04:20.427 --> 04:21.727
for handing out candy tonight.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.296
Oh, it's our pleasure.
Kids love candy.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.898
Although... an apple a day
keeps the doctor--

04:26.900 --> 04:29.434
Okay, Mom, Mom, seriously, stop.

04:30.604 --> 04:34.239
Aw, I hate that I always
have to miss Halloween.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.042
But the Mystic Crystal
Convention is only
one day a year.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.611
So I'll see you tomorrow.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.648
Oh... keep an eye out
for the beachside
spider sprayer.

04:42.650 --> 04:46.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, hold on.

04:46.887 --> 04:52.291
You can't just like drop words
like "spider sprayer" and then
just walk out.

04:52.293 --> 04:56.461
Oh, right. It's your first
beachside Halloween.

04:56.463 --> 05:01.166
Every year a prankster
goes house to house

05:01.168 --> 05:03.435
surprising the person
who answers the door

05:03.437 --> 05:07.439
by covering them
in a spray string
spider web.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.642
And you just let this happen?

05:12.112 --> 05:17.949
No, no, no, no, no,
unacceptable, not in my house,
I mean your house!

05:17.951 --> 05:19.951
No one lets it happen,

05:19.953 --> 05:23.088
you just can't stop
the beachside spider sprayer.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.491
Every year the costume
is different, so you never
see it coming.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.328
Okay, so then, how do you know
it's even the same person?

05:29.330 --> 05:31.663
The sprayer always
has a pumpkin bucket.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.967
Hmm. Well, that spider sprayer
is messin' with the wrong witch,

05:35.969 --> 05:39.471
'cause you know why?
This witch don't get webbed!

05:39.473 --> 05:40.505
Bam! What?

05:44.278 --> 05:49.715
Good luck with that, Maddie.
And joy and fulfillment to all.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.049
Bye.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.551
(text ding)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.620
Ohh! Yes! Okay,
the tooth fairy just got
some awesome news.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.356
Ruby, you and I just got
our reservation

05:57.358 --> 05:59.624
at the Demon's Dungeon tonight!

05:59.626 --> 06:02.294
Is that the torture-chamber
themed restaurant?

06:02.296 --> 06:05.530
Yes! I've always wanted
to go there!

06:05.532 --> 06:07.632
Torture me while I eat, please!

06:09.203 --> 06:12.471
Seriously, Ruby? You would
rather go out to eat dinner

06:12.473 --> 06:13.705
than go trick-or-treating?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.508
Oh, it's okay. Mom took me
trick-or-treating this afternoon

06:16.510 --> 06:19.811
with the six-year-olds.
Super easy to elbow them

06:19.813 --> 06:22.781
out of the way
for the good stuff.

06:26.387 --> 06:30.655
If studying about
radioactive isotopes
on Halloween is wrong,

06:30.657 --> 06:32.724
then I don't wanna be right.

06:36.063 --> 06:40.499
Well, well, well...
look who decided to drop
the dress-up clothes

06:40.501 --> 06:43.502
and put on
their scientist pants!

06:43.504 --> 06:49.341
Don't mind us, just doing
a simple groundbreaking
teleportation project.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.746
No, we're not.
We are playin' a spooky prank.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.749
Val is about to find out
how much fun it is
to get scared.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.586
-Boo!
-Ahh! Do it again, Parker,
do it again!

07:01.588 --> 07:04.423
-Boo!
-(laughs)

07:04.425 --> 07:06.258
Teleportation?

07:06.260 --> 07:09.294
We're here to study science,
not hokum.

07:09.296 --> 07:15.367
It's not hokum... Finch.
It's real.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.470
I'm listening, Falcon.

07:19.706 --> 07:24.075
Who's ready to witness
scientific history?

07:24.077 --> 07:28.146
Yeah, here's the thing.
Due to the laws of science,

07:28.148 --> 07:32.717
teleportation is just
a teensy bit impossible.

07:32.719 --> 07:37.889
Well, then, get ready
to be a teensy bit impressed!

07:38.892 --> 07:42.527
As I... teleport this chicken!

07:43.630 --> 07:47.632
I said get "a" chicken,
not "some" chicken!

07:48.635 --> 07:51.770
That was not clear
in your text.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.606
Falcon requires clarity.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.642
Just go get us a live chicken!

07:57.644 --> 08:03.715
You do not tell Falcon
what to do. You suggest,
and hope that he agrees.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.086
Falcon agrees.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.864
Wheeeee!

08:18.866 --> 08:22.834
Wow! Every restaurant
should have a slide entrance.

08:25.639 --> 08:30.709
I requested that they put us
in the death-row section.

08:30.711 --> 08:35.847
Oh, wow, Ruby...
look at these amazing
electric chairs.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.283
(pretending to be shocked)

08:38.285 --> 08:41.119
Thank you
for bringing me here.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.788
This is gonna be
the greatest Halloween ever.

08:43.790 --> 08:47.959
Good evening, victims.
My name is...

08:47.961 --> 08:49.895
Liv Rooney.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.863
Well, that's really weird,
I thought I was Liv Rooney.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.866
Liv, it's me.

08:56.336 --> 08:59.204
Oh, I'm so sorry...
do I know you?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.872
We acted together.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.574
On "Voltage."

09:02.576 --> 09:04.342
We did?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.811
Do you recognize me now?

09:06.813 --> 09:09.714
(roaring)

09:09.716 --> 09:14.853
You're Zaydock,
SkyVolt's sworn enemy!

09:14.855 --> 09:18.790
Actually, I'm not Zaydock
anymore, I'm just
Henry the waiter.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.661
Henry! What've you been up to?

09:22.663 --> 09:26.932
Well... not playing Zaydock
on "Voltage," that's for sure.

09:26.934 --> 09:31.036
Well, right...
because SkyVolt killed you.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.940
Zaydock was supposed
to come back to life.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.944
But when... Liv decided
to leave the show,
that storyline

09:38.946 --> 09:41.846
went right out the window.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.419
Oh.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.355
Oh, indeed.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.961
So... what brings you
to LA, Liv?

09:57.464 --> 10:03.535
Uh... funny story, um, I...
am actually living here now.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.339
But you decided to quit
"Voltage" because
you didn't want to move to LA.

10:08.976 --> 10:12.243
Changed my mind?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.880
So I guess you're just
a struggling actor like me
now, huh?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.916
(laughs nervously)

10:17.918 --> 10:20.552
That's an even funnier story.

10:20.554 --> 10:23.822
I am actually
the lead on a new show.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.157
It's called "Sing it Louder."

10:33.133 --> 10:35.700
How great for you.

10:41.475 --> 10:47.545
Hey, Ruby? Um...
so this night just became...
really awkward for me.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.981
Are you okay if we leave early?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.917
What? No, we can't leave.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.787
We haven't had
the full torture experience.

10:55.789 --> 11:00.525
Right, see, that's kind
of what I'm trying to avoid...
(laughs nervously)

11:00.527 --> 11:03.928
It's very clear to me
that Henry hates me,

11:03.930 --> 11:06.998
and he blames me
for losing his job, so...

11:07.000 --> 11:10.101
He's just playing a character.
Here, read the menu.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.705
The Torture King has been
living in the dungeon
for 20 years,

11:13.707 --> 11:18.043
and is full of rage and hate.
So he doesn't hate you,
he hates all of us.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.980
Here's your bread, ladies.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.015
And your knife!

11:30.290 --> 11:32.891
How fun is that?

11:34.961 --> 11:36.561
So super fun!

11:43.003 --> 11:46.871
Okay, you expect me to believe
you can transport a chicken

11:46.873 --> 11:49.307
from this pod over to that pod.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.042
Never gonna happen.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.045
Oh... it's gonna happen.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.848
This is real deal
teleportation, girl.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.917
Drink it in!

12:01.521 --> 12:05.390
Your hero has returned...

12:05.392 --> 12:08.860
with... the chicken.

12:08.862 --> 12:13.331
(oohs and ahs)

12:13.333 --> 12:16.000
Have you guys never seen
a chicken before?

12:16.002 --> 12:18.503
Not one held by Falcon.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.209
All right...
it's teleportin' time!

12:24.211 --> 12:28.012
They call me insane. Mad!
But I will show them!

12:28.014 --> 12:30.048
I will show them all!

12:30.050 --> 12:32.083
Muahahahahaaaa!

12:32.085 --> 12:38.156
(buzzing noises)

12:38.291 --> 12:41.593
Now... let's see if it worked.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.035
It worked!
The chicken teleported!

12:51.037 --> 12:53.872
And you didn't think
it was possible.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.274
I still don't think
it's possible.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.409
It's not possible.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.312
The pods have fake backs
and there are two chickens.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.815
But we're setting up
the big scare.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.252
I can't believe
the "geniuses" are fallin'
for this.

13:07.254 --> 13:11.456
It's like believin'
that fried chicken
comes from real chickens.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.726
It does, Munch.

13:14.728 --> 13:20.165
My god. I'm a monster.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.504
Oh... what's
with the marshmallows, hon?

13:26.506 --> 13:30.909
Okay, so I have figured out
the best way to combat
the beachside spider sprayer.

13:30.911 --> 13:35.747
I am going to strike first....
so that I throw him off guard
and he can't web me.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.516
(doorbell rings)
Spider sprayer!

13:41.822 --> 13:44.189
Take that, spider sprayer!

13:45.325 --> 13:49.961
Oh... no pumpkin buckets.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.062
Happy Halloween!

13:54.000 --> 13:57.402
I'm so sorry... please
don't egg our house.

14:00.607 --> 14:05.944
Here you are, young lady.
And here's yours...

14:05.946 --> 14:09.781
Liv Rooney... superstar!

14:09.783 --> 14:14.419
And the reason I now live
with my grandmother.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.058
Okay, can we please
get out of here now?

14:20.060 --> 14:23.995
What? No, the Torture King
show's gonna start soon.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.364
He's really starting
to scare me.

14:26.366 --> 14:31.469
You're supposed to be scared.
It's the Demon's Dungeon,
not the Cuddle Castle.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.975
Okay, no, no, Ruby, stop,
I'm sorry, this is way
too weird. Let's go!

14:36.977 --> 14:41.412
Relax! It's not real poison,
it's lime coconut fizzy water.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.086
Yeah...

14:48.088 --> 14:52.156
Oooh... maybe you're right,
I'm, I'm really being ridiculous
right now.

14:52.158 --> 14:58.229
I'm just gonna take a second,
you know, breathe, relax...

14:59.099 --> 15:03.234
Whoo, Henry is not trying
to kill me.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.169
Henry's trying to kill me!

15:07.240 --> 15:10.041
Oh, Ruby, can you please
come over and help me
get out of these things?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.242
Sure.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.410
Liv Rooney!

15:14.547 --> 15:20.618
Look at you...
all defenseless and...
unable to defend yourself.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.691
Henry's here. You're okay.

15:26.693 --> 15:32.764
Of course she's okay.
Because she's the star
of the show.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.534
You got picked to be
in the show?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.570
Henry's right. You are lucky.

15:39.572 --> 15:44.208
Who wants to see me
make Liv Rooney suffer?

15:44.210 --> 15:46.311
Crowd:
Liv! Liv! Liv! Liv!

15:46.313 --> 15:48.546
Let's take her to the stage!

15:52.118 --> 15:55.987
So tell me, Falcon...
have you ever held a pig?

15:55.989 --> 16:00.158
As a matter of fact,
Finch... I have.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.062
Yes! What haven't you done?

16:04.064 --> 16:07.732
Well... I've never littered.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.202
I find it... distasteful.

16:12.839 --> 16:16.774
So, are you convinced,
or do you want me to teleport
something else?

16:16.776 --> 16:19.610
Please!
You didn't teleport anything!

16:19.612 --> 16:21.145
It's a trick!

16:21.147 --> 16:24.082
Face it, Parker...
you're a chicken tricker!

16:25.151 --> 16:27.485
I knew Val would be
the toughest to fool.

16:27.487 --> 16:31.255
but what she didn't know,
is that she was up against
Dr. P.

16:31.257 --> 16:36.260
Granted, that's just
an honorary title,
but she did not know that!

16:36.262 --> 16:38.363
You really don't believe me?

16:38.365 --> 16:40.431
Here... you can press
the button.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.799
You're on.

16:41.801 --> 16:45.303
One condition, though.
You have to read this...
it's tradition.

16:45.305 --> 16:50.842
Fine. They called me insane,
mad, but I will show them,
I will show them all...

16:50.844 --> 16:53.378
evil laugh.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.382
No, no-no, no, you're supposed
to do the evil-- you know what,
just forget it,

16:57.384 --> 16:58.216
just press the button!

16:59.819 --> 17:02.286
-W-wait, wait!
-No, Joey, get outta there!

17:07.994 --> 17:09.193
Is everyone okay?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.362
Find your buddy!

17:15.568 --> 17:16.634
What happened?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.403
Is Falcon okay?

17:21.074 --> 17:25.410
(gasp)
Oh, no... I must've
teleported him with the chicken!

17:25.412 --> 17:27.011
What if it scrambled
their DNA?

17:27.013 --> 17:30.381
Should we check the other pod?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.483
We have to know.
For science.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.219
And I have to know.
For Falcon.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.696
Okay, I'm not sure we want
to know what's in that pod.

17:45.698 --> 17:48.900
You're being ridiculous.
Give me that.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.401
I'll open it.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.673
Falcon, are you in there?

17:55.675 --> 17:57.375
(clucking)

17:57.377 --> 18:01.279
(screaming)

18:05.785 --> 18:07.618
-Happy Halloween!
-Happy Halloween!

18:09.255 --> 18:11.089
Say what, now?

18:11.091 --> 18:14.525
You just got scared,
Halloween style.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.360
Wh-- This was a prank?

18:16.362 --> 18:18.463
So, Falcon, you're okay?

18:19.365 --> 18:20.665
I was worried.

18:22.368 --> 18:25.703
Wait...
this whole thing
was a joke?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.272
Gotcha.
How do you feel?

18:28.274 --> 18:32.376
My senses are heightened...
my heart's in my throat...

18:32.378 --> 18:34.745
I've never felt more alive!

18:34.747 --> 18:37.949
So, um... would you say
that you had fun?

18:37.951 --> 18:40.718
I did! I guess
I was wrong...

18:40.720 --> 18:43.421
being scared can be fun.

18:43.423 --> 18:48.159
So says... Falcon.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.997
You opened our eyes, Falcon.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.800
Please, Finch...
it was Falcon's pleasure.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.639
Uh, I opened your eyes, too.
I set up the machine,
rigged the lights,

19:01.641 --> 19:06.344
and even came up with
"Bgawk!" He was gonna say
"Cockadoodle Falcon"!

19:06.346 --> 19:08.813
That would've been even better.

19:08.815 --> 19:14.318
Cockadoodle Falcon!
Cockadoodle Falcon!
Cockadoodle Falcon!

19:14.320 --> 19:16.420
You have got to be kidding me!

19:20.593 --> 19:26.430
Prepare to see Liv Rooney
in the performance
of her life!

19:28.001 --> 19:31.135
Or should I say...
her death?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.336
(evil laugh)

19:34.174 --> 19:36.107
Soon, the life of Liv Rooney

19:36.109 --> 19:41.345
will rest in the razor's edge
of my ax.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.615
Or in the forgiving hands
of a fellow actor!

19:46.186 --> 19:50.121
Any last words
before I send you
to your maker?

19:55.461 --> 19:59.463
I will get you a part
on my new show.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.966
Really?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.570
Oh, that would be great!

20:05.572 --> 20:10.341
Yes... yeah, yeah, yeah,
anything, just please don't
kill me.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.710
Don't kill you?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.479
Liv, you don't think
this is real, do you?

20:15.481 --> 20:18.382
Um... kind of?

20:18.384 --> 20:24.155
See, you seemed like really,
really upset that I sort of,
kind of ruined your life.

20:24.157 --> 20:27.325
Liv, even though
you destroyed my career

20:27.327 --> 20:30.928
with your whimsical decisions,
this is all part of an act.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.497
I would never
actually hurt you.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.704
Oh, of course you wouldn't.

20:39.706 --> 20:43.274
I don't know why,
I just like, I got
this crazy idea

20:43.276 --> 20:44.575
in my head. I just...

20:46.946 --> 20:49.247
-Hey, are we good?
-Yeah, we're good.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.215
Great.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.850
Prepare to die!

20:55.521 --> 20:58.422
SkyVolt is here!
Leave my cousin alone!

20:58.424 --> 20:59.790
Ow!

21:01.060 --> 21:04.795
I'm sorry, Liv!
I should've believed you
right away!

21:04.797 --> 21:06.464
I won't let him kill you!

21:06.466 --> 21:08.599
Ruby! Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!

21:08.601 --> 21:11.102
Ruby! He's not trying
to kill me.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.203
Really?

21:12.205 --> 21:13.404
Yeah.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.825
Then I've crossed the line.

21:17.826 --> 21:19.943
No, no, keep goin' kid,
the audience is eating this up.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.613
And I can use the tips.
(growling)

21:29.389 --> 21:32.757
You don't have the guts
to web me, spider sprayer!

21:32.759 --> 21:35.226
Maddie?

21:35.228 --> 21:37.828
Honey, I know
that screaming at children

21:37.830 --> 21:42.800
has become a Halloween
tradition, but I think
it's time to call it a day.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.568
No, no, no,.. no, Mom.
You don't understand.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.138
I have figured out
how to stop the spider sprayer.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.908
So, so I need
to make sure that I see
that he has the pumpkin bucket

21:50.910 --> 21:54.512
before I strike,
and see, this, this rope,
is gonna help me open the door

21:54.514 --> 21:56.914
from a safe distance,
and then once I am sure

21:56.916 --> 21:59.450
that it is the spider sprayer,
I am going to unleash a smell

21:59.452 --> 22:00.685
that not even a mother can love.

22:00.687 --> 22:04.655
-You don't mean--
-I do.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.694
Joey and Parker's
entire laundry hamper
is rigged to dump all over

22:09.696 --> 22:11.996
-that porch!
-Oh!

22:11.998 --> 22:13.597
(doorbell rings)
Spider sprayer!

22:14.834 --> 22:16.167
(both gasping)

22:16.169 --> 22:17.835
-Pumpkin bucket!
-Pumpkin bucket!

22:17.837 --> 22:20.071
Trick-or-stink!

22:24.477 --> 22:28.646
Take that, spider sprayer!
Bam! What?

22:28.648 --> 22:31.115
Oh! Aunt Dena!

22:31.117 --> 22:32.550
I am so sorry,

22:32.552 --> 22:33.951
I thought that you
were the spider sprayer.

22:35.188 --> 22:38.622
W-- Why are you
not at the Mystic
Crystal Convention?

22:38.624 --> 22:42.493
I made that up. I'm an adult
that likes to go
trick-or-treating,

22:42.495 --> 22:43.928
but I'm ashamed to admit it.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.967
Oh, that's...
well, yeah,
that's really weird.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.372
Yeah, Dena, you didn't
have to lie to us,

22:54.374 --> 22:56.307
you could've told us
where you went.

22:56.309 --> 23:02.380
Yeah... I guess I just got...
caught up... in my...
web of lies!

23:16.562 --> 23:20.698
Ah, well... you may
have won Halloween,

23:20.700 --> 23:25.269
Aunt Dena, but I will get you
back at Thanksgiving, so...

23:25.271 --> 23:29.140
I hope you like gravy.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.810
Muahahahaha!
