Previously on  Hellcats...

00:02.667 --> 00:04.291
You sure school's
worth all this?

00:04.291 --> 00:06.667
I'm going to graduate
pass the bar up north

00:06.667 --> 00:10.209
and work in a DA's office
where everybody talks
in flat Yankee vowels.

00:10.209 --> 00:11.625
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:11.625 --> 00:13.084
I have one now
for cheerleading.

00:13.084 --> 00:15.417
-Cheerleading?
-Oh. Hello, Marti.

00:15.417 --> 00:16.708
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.542
-Do you have a thing for Dan?
-What?

00:18.542 --> 00:20.333
-Because if you do,
I'll back off.
-No.

00:20.333 --> 00:22.000
I don't wanna create
drama here.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.417
Dan and I are just buds.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.375
I'm on a date
with half the squad.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.209
Look, the girl was
home-schooled, okay?

00:27.209 --> 00:28.625
Her parents raised her
like veal.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.959
The group thing is how her
church used to handle dating.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.750
Growing up, I figured
I'd wait until I was married
to have sex.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.750
Marriage, sex...
let's just take
one step at a time.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.000
Not worry so much.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.042
I need two pre-law students
to help me.

00:40.042 --> 00:42.000
You're in.
My law clinic starts Monday.

sentenced to life in prison

00:45.250 --> 00:47.667
You've made it clear
you don't care
if Travis is innocent.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.209
You found proof
of his innocence?

00:49.209 --> 00:51.667
I'm searching everywhere
for this Jane Loomis.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.250
Ta-da. We'd like
to talk to you

00:53.250 --> 00:55.125
about your ex-boyfriend,
Travis Guthrie.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.291
Our law clinic is looking
into his robbery conviction.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.583
I really have
nothing more to add.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.041
We're setting up
for the spirit party.

01:42.041 --> 01:45.167
Oh, yeah, that.
I didn't realize it was
coming up so soon.

01:45.167 --> 01:47.166
Haven't you been reading
the  Daily Cheertown Bulletin?

I didn't know we had one.

Still, why Go-Go's?

01:51.250 --> 01:55.000
It's the 25th anniversary
of the founding of
the Hellcats in 1985.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.500
So, this year has got
an '80s theme.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.125
I like that there's
a sense of history
in the bobblehead community.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.834
Yeah, it's really hard
to make that nickname
sound complimentary.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.209
Oh, I kid the bobblehead.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.542
You think
you're being playful.

02:17.041 --> 02:18.583
Something came up.

02:18.583 --> 02:19.875
I can't stay.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.834

Fotogem  is doing
a style piece

02:23.209 --> 02:25.166
on the private lives
of Lancer football stars.

02:25.166 --> 02:27.375
Wow, who said
journalism is dead?

02:27.375 --> 02:29.834
It's a PR offensive from
the athletic department.

02:29.834 --> 02:32.708
They're trying to make
people forget about
that pay-for-play scandal.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.125
I couldn't care less.

02:34.125 --> 02:37.208
All I know is
I am getting my picture
in a glossy magazine.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.417
Never thought I'd see you
as a football wife.

02:39.417 --> 02:42.083
[laughs]
I am not anyone's wife.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.792
But it's a great magazine.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.042
I'm lookin' hot,

02:45.042 --> 02:46.500
Jake is gonna look dashing,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.084
and after the photo shoot,

02:48.084 --> 02:49.875
we'll go have nasty,
acrobatic sex

02:49.875 --> 02:52.000
in positions that
you can't even draw.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.917
Oh, pretty much anyone can
draw a stick figure, so...

02:54.917 --> 02:58.542
-God. Who let him in here?
-I did.

02:58.542 --> 03:00.959

God, Savannah,
does he talk that much
during sex?

03:07.166 --> 03:10.417
-I wouldn't know.
-Right. Of course
you wouldn't.

03:10.417 --> 03:12.792
Don't wait up, kids.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.084
What does that mean,
"Of course I wouldn't?"

03:15.084 --> 03:18.041
I don't like how she's gettin'
ever since she hooked up
with Jake.

03:18.041 --> 03:21.167
Anybody ever tell you
you think about Jake too much?

03:23.583 --> 03:25.166
Uh, Jake who?

03:27.667 --> 03:30.208
That's great, guys.

We'll do singles over there.

03:35.208 --> 03:38.125
-Jake.
-Yeah?

03:38.125 --> 03:42.041
So, tell me a little
about the social life
as Lancers' QB one.

I can name your perfume.

-No way.
-Mmm-hmm.

-Lolita Lempicka.
-That's amazing.

03:58.084 --> 03:59.792
-How did you do that?
-Do what?

03:59.792 --> 04:01.542
How did I charm you in
ten seconds?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.209

-Alice is a cheerleader.
-Of course she is.

04:16.916 --> 04:18.166
Quarterbacks and pompom girls,

04:18.166 --> 04:20.083
it's like peanut butter
and jelly, right?

04:20.083 --> 04:22.084
Two great tastes.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.250
We're not pompom girls.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.792
Oh?

04:25.792 --> 04:28.750
Yes, we cheer at games,
but that's just
to pay the rent.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.208
We're competitive athletes.

04:30.208 --> 04:33.333
Yeah, the Hellcats
rock the sidelines
every Saturday afternoon.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.333
-Our fans just love 'em.
-You said the team competes?

04:36.333 --> 04:39.417
Yes, we're ranked seventh
overall in the southern
co-ed division

04:39.417 --> 04:43.167
and we've qualified to move on
to sectional competitions
next month.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.417
-Impressive.
-Oh, you would
think so, right?

04:45.417 --> 04:47.167
But apparently
it doesn't matter

04:47.167 --> 04:50.084
to Lancers' crack athletic
department bureaucrats.

04:50.084 --> 04:52.917
They reallocated our funds
to the volleyball team.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.500
We love our volleyball gals.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.000

butt. Know what I'm saying?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.125

05:00.166 --> 05:03.125
But somehow Lancer
found $3 million

05:03.125 --> 05:05.125
for Red Raymond's salary
this year.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.917
Can I steal the lovely
Ms. Verdura?

You're hurting my arm.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.708
What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

05:18.708 --> 05:20.208
You don't talk
to me like that.

This is an article
about the football team,
the Lions,

05:23.166 --> 05:25.667

go back in there, smile

shut your mouth.

upon you,

Tell me.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.084
Yes, sir.

06:00.417 --> 06:01.834
Thanks, Angel.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.750
I hope this man here
has told you

06:05.750 --> 06:07.000

Yeah. Of course you can stay.
Let me just clear it
with Savannah.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.042
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

-Don't make rash promises.
-Hmm.

We're not planning on having
sex with you guys in the room.

Oh. Thank the Lord
for small favors.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.667

just take the sofa outside.

No problem. It's all good.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.458
[Dan] At least
you achieved mattress.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.959
I'm sorry. What?

07:39.959 --> 07:42.125
I said at least
he achieved mattress.

07:42.125 --> 07:45.125
I know what you said.
It was a crack.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.250
No crack. Statement of fact.
He is in the bed.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.917
Because he's got
a cool girlfriend
and yours is a prude?

07:49.917 --> 07:51.083
I did not say that.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.083
I would have remembered
if he called me cool.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.166

Okay, now everyone's
on eggshells.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.209

08:19.209 --> 08:21.417
You guys want me to invite
Dan in my bed, right?

08:21.417 --> 08:23.166
Ease the tension?

08:23.166 --> 08:25.083
Nope. Not really.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.250
Do not have a dog
in that race.

08:27.250 --> 08:31.125
I'm a good girl,
and I resent being forced
to apologize for it.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.500
All right, look,

08:32.500 --> 08:35.042
nobody is asking you
to apologize.

08:35.042 --> 08:36.792
Look, why don't
I just go home?

To your room you share
with your older brother
and his fiancee?

08:39.457 --> 08:41.875
That's terrible and awkward.
You say so all the time.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.834
And yet, at this moment,
it seems strangely appealing.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.000
You get the bed.
I'll take the sofa.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.834
-No, I'm not letting you--
-No, you're a guest.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.042
You get the bed.
That's how it works.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.000
Wow.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.333
Somebody's got issues.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.792
Aw, so much
for my orgy fantasy.

09:11.542 --> 09:14.291
Is it me, or is Savannah
getting weirdly intense?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.125
She's drunk
on your heady musk.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.250
-Not that drunk, sadly.
-Poor Dan Patch,

09:18.250 --> 09:21.458
finally dating a cheerleader
and she won't let you
under her skirt.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.875
I have the same problem with
Scottish bagpipe players.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.291
Savannah's a great girl.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.084
I just wish she'd lighten up
on the whole sex issue.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.917
Lighten up, as in
agree to have it with you?

09:32.208 --> 09:35.125
Not necessarily,
believe it or not.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.125
Are you saying
you don't want sex?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Not if it's gonna be
under these circumstances.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.875
I'm tired
of talking about it.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.875
Am I okay with not having sex?

09:45.875 --> 09:47.792
-Do I think she's a prude?
-Hmm.

09:47.792 --> 09:50.500
If she gives it up,
will I consider marriage
down the line?

09:50.500 --> 09:53.042
-Wait. Marriage? Really?
-Subject was broached.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.625
Wow.

09:54.625 --> 09:59.167
Just the way she obsesses
over the virginity issue...
scares me.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.333
-Don't overreact.
-Yeah? Tell her that.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.542
In her head,
she's building it up

10:03.542 --> 10:06.084
into this gigantic
rite of passage

10:06.084 --> 10:08.125
that's gonna change
her life forever.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.667
It's a lot of responsibility.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.125
We know all about you
and taking responsibility.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.875
Okay, that's unkind.

10:13.875 --> 10:16.167
Look...

10:16.167 --> 10:19.000
hang on to her
with both hands, Dan Patch.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.625
She's good people.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.041
You don't think I know that?

10:22.041 --> 10:24.000
Yeah, well, remember it.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Crap. I'm late.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.542
Where are you off to?

10:27.542 --> 10:28.959
State prison.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.834
[laughing]

10:30.834 --> 10:32.208
I want your life!

10:33.959 --> 10:36.125
[guitar music]

10:36.125 --> 10:38.834
Guys any closer
to springin' me
from this hole?

10:38.834 --> 10:40.542
Making progress.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.542
We've been looking
into deed records.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.167
Your old pal Jane Loomis
is homeless no longer.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.875
She lives here.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.125
Two years ago,
she was splittin' her time

10:52.125 --> 10:53.959
between a freeway underpass
and a shelter,

10:53.959 --> 10:55.542
and now she's livin'
in this palace?

10:55.542 --> 10:57.041
Huh, it's hardly a palace.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.875
Doesn't even have
a proper garage.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.125
We think it's weird, too.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.084
A homeless woman agrees
to be your alibi

11:04.084 --> 11:06.125
then recants on the stand,
incriminating you

11:06.125 --> 11:09.083
and two years later,
she's mysteriously
living the middle-class dream.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.041
Something's off.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.708
Do you think
someone bribed her to lie?

11:13.708 --> 11:15.375
Maybe.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.125
If we find out who it is,
it gets you one step closer
to gettin' out of this place.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.959
House is owned by a guy
named Bobby Overton.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.417
[Marti]
Ring a bell?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.708
I... I don't know him. Sorry.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.084
He, uh, owns
a furniture company.

11:28.084 --> 11:29.959
And you think he's in on it?

11:29.959 --> 11:31.667
Maybe.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.750
It takes a special sort
of humanitarian

11:33.750 --> 11:36.625
to rent a house to a woman
with no previous address.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.667
We'll see what
Mr. Overton has to say.

11:42.084 --> 11:44.000
[Bobby]
Real estate law?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I wasn't aware
such a discipline existed.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.959
How can I help you kids?

11:48.959 --> 11:53.083
County records lists you
as the owner of a house
on May Dale Street.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.333
If you don't mind me asking,
what kind of a school project
is this?

11:57.333 --> 11:59.333
We're doing a mock court case

11:59.333 --> 12:01.333
involving, uh,
rent-control laws.

12:01.333 --> 12:04.875
We're surveying
the properties on that block
to examine the law's effects.

12:04.875 --> 12:09.333
So, uh, while it's not
specifically documented
as a rental unit,

12:09.333 --> 12:11.083
there appears to be
a tenant living there.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
Uh, yeah,
I did that one off the books.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.167
A favor to a friend.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.834
What the tax man don't know,
he can't tax, hmm?

12:18.834 --> 12:20.834
Oh. Yep.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.458
You're not here
to bust me, right?

12:22.458 --> 12:23.959
-Ah.
-Oh, no.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.166
No, we wouldn't dream of it.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.125
So, Jane Loomis
is your friend?

12:27.125 --> 12:28.583
Indeed she is.

12:28.583 --> 12:32.084
I met Janie Loomis
at the South Parkway Mission
down on Third Street.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.000
I volunteer there
every Sunday.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.125
Uh, pardon my French,
but life has dealt
Janie a crap hand.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.583
I had a property that had
been empty for two years,

12:41.583 --> 12:43.917
so I let her
take it over rent-free.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.667
Give her a chance to get
back on her feet, you know.

12:46.667 --> 12:50.084
How, how long has Jane
been in the house?

12:50.084 --> 12:51.834
Eh, a year or thereabouts.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.500
You know, it's a shame
your professor's

12:54.500 --> 12:57.375
got you runnin' all over town,
doin' his dirty work.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.291
All work and no play,
that's no way to live.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.167
Two tickets to the U2 concert
at the Pyramid next month.

13:06.167 --> 13:09.917
I'm not gonna use 'em.
That little Irish fella, hmm.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.625
You take your girl out,
show her a good time.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.375
I would consider it
a personal favor

13:16.375 --> 13:19.875
if you could
leave Janie Loomis
alone from now on.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.000
Janie's been through a lot.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.959
[woman on PA]
Mr. Overton
to the loading dock.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.792
Does the name Travis Guthrie
mean anything to you?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.708
I meet a lot of people.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.458
I've never been
good with names,
so excuse me.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.166
My gal gets cranky
if I don't hop to.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.209
That's a man with
something to hide.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.250
[Vanessa]
Bill Marsh.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.042
I hate that guy.

13:52.042 --> 13:53.250
He called me an idiot.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.500
I mean, he's a freakin'
pencil pusher.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.208
Have you seen the size
of his office? Laughable.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.959
Some of us are tryin' to work.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.250
Where is your indignation?

14:03.250 --> 14:05.792
Your outrage on my behalf?

14:05.792 --> 14:08.125
Well, I left my outrage
in my locker.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.167
And I'm tellin' you,
it was so powerful

14:10.167 --> 14:11.500
I needed to use two padlocks

14:11.500 --> 14:14.250
so it didn't
bust out and terrorize
downtown Memphis.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.042
Is this funny to you?

14:17.042 --> 14:19.000
Is this funny to you?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.333
[laughs]
You're angry
in your underpants.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.041
That's kind of funny,
I guess.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.000
Oh, Jakey.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.708
I always wanna
remember you like this

14:28.708 --> 14:30.792
when you still had
your testicles.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.083
[laughing]

14:34.291 --> 14:37.625
Okay, listen, Bill Marsh is
a sanitary napkin in a suit.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.708
I get that.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.417
The coach hates him,
we all hate him

14:40.417 --> 14:43.208
but there's a certain protocol
we're supposed to be following

14:43.208 --> 14:45.291
as ambassadors
of Lancer Football.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.291
I'm not an ambassador
of football.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.583
You're a football wife.

14:50.458 --> 14:54.000
Is that how you see me?
Really?

14:54.000 --> 14:57.542
I'm some kind of, uh, groupie?

14:57.542 --> 14:59.417
A hanger-on?

14:59.417 --> 15:00.625
No.

15:02.042 --> 15:05.959
No, but you're
in a certain position
because of my position.

15:05.959 --> 15:07.041
I'm quarterback, darlin'.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.834
Being my girlfriend
comes with certain
expectations.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.583
I don't like expectations.

15:12.583 --> 15:13.917
I defy them.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.041
Okay.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.500
Alice, this article
is a puff piece.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.875
Okay, dress up
football players
in nice suits.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.042
Show 'em how well we clean up.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.667
Buy the T-shirt
and forget that

15:26.667 --> 15:29.583
Lancer ever got sanctioned
by the NCAA.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.917
-So, it's a PR whitewash?
-Yes, exactly.

15:31.917 --> 15:34.834
So under the circumstances,
going on and on
to that reporter

15:34.834 --> 15:37.125
about cheerleading
was completely inappropriate.

15:37.125 --> 15:40.542
She asked me a question
about cheerleading,
and I answered it.

15:40.542 --> 15:43.792
I was way more interesting
than you droning on
about the Lancer Lions.

15:43.792 --> 15:45.583
"Ooh, we work hard
and play hard."

15:45.583 --> 15:47.917
I was doing my job, Alice.
Try doing yours.

15:47.917 --> 15:49.458
Support me.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.166
And if I don't feel
like doing that job?

15:52.875 --> 15:54.542
Then you're fired.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.167
I'm sorry.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.458
Oh, my God.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.209
I'm kiddin'. Jeez.

16:03.209 --> 16:05.125
The look on your face.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.084
[sighs]

16:07.084 --> 16:09.583
You know, you are a nightmare
in a pair of panties.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.208
[door closes]

16:17.917 --> 16:19.125
I've made a decision.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.042
Hmm. Coming over
to the dark side?

16:21.042 --> 16:22.458
Gonna finally become
a dog person?

16:22.458 --> 16:24.084
What? God, no.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.250
What then?

16:25.250 --> 16:27.333
I'm tired of feeling
like an oddball.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.375
I'm ready
to take the plunge.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.834
Find out what all
the fuss is about.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.667
Fuss about what?

16:33.667 --> 16:36.125
Virginity.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.042
I'm chopping down
the cherry tree.

16:38.042 --> 16:39.542
Okay, so tomorrow
after the party,

16:39.542 --> 16:42.458
a limo will take us
to the Carmichael hotel
downtown.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.500
I reserved a suite,
white roses, and candles.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.167
Oh, I know Dan loves
Memphis music.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.209
So, I will not be skimping
on the Justin Timberlake.

16:48.209 --> 16:50.041
Sunday morning,
we'll do the buffet brunch.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.166
So, oh, dress!
You could help me there.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.834
Will Dan prefer a bra
that hooks in the front
or the back?

16:54.834 --> 16:56.875
-Savannah, no.
-If you think
I'm going braless,

16:56.875 --> 16:59.167
you can forget about it.
Front hooking, I think.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.667
That way,
we maintain eye contact.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.375
-Wow.
-Oh, what's your
position on G-strings?

17:02.375 --> 17:03.667
Personally, I think
they're disgusting

17:03.667 --> 17:05.000
but this night
is for Dan, so--

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Okay, you're talking
really fast
and kind of crazy.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.125
Just sit down
and breathe, all right?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.165
[exhales] Sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.583
Yeah.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.458
Was it that obvious?

17:14.458 --> 17:15.791
[sighing]

17:18.125 --> 17:20.875
My first time was
totally unexpected, okay?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.000
It was in the back
of a Buick off Route 51

17:25.000 --> 17:27.333
with somebody I never
thought it would happen with.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.417
Were you in love with him?

17:33.291 --> 17:35.042
That's a complicated question.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.208
My point is it just happened.

17:41.208 --> 17:45.041
No preplanning.
No stage management.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.959
And it was good.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.083
For what it was.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.708
Why are you telling me this?

17:51.708 --> 17:53.500
Because I think
you're awesome.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.291
You need
to know that it's okay

17:56.291 --> 17:59.000
to throw away the itinerary.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.125
You don't have
to micromanage this.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.250
No offense, Marti.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.125
But for me, losing your
virginity is gigantic.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.625
I will remember this night
for the rest of my life.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.125
It has to be perfect.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.250
It can't be just
some haphazard accident

18:15.250 --> 18:17.792
that happens
in the back of a car.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.084
Yeah, well, you show up
at this hotel with Dan

18:20.084 --> 18:21.291
and he sees the planning
you've put,

18:21.291 --> 18:23.084
and you're gonna scare him.

18:23.084 --> 18:25.166
A plan that ends in sex.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.084
I mean, what guy
says no to that?

18:27.084 --> 18:29.625
You're, you're putting
too much on this.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.500
If he thinks it means more
to you than it means to him...

18:32.500 --> 18:33.917
he's gonna run away.

18:37.125 --> 18:38.959
That is
a horrible thing to say.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.291
Uh, Savannah,
I'm just trying to help.

18:41.291 --> 18:42.542
Look, lighten up.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.125
Stop obsessing about the sex.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.208
-Let it go.
-Let it go.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.834
You sound just like him.

18:51.209 --> 18:53.083
Marti, have you been talking
to Dan about this?

18:55.250 --> 18:56.750
You can't ask me that.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.625
I am.

19:01.417 --> 19:02.834
Dan and I are best friends

19:02.834 --> 19:05.166
and we talk about
a lot of things.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.417
Before I started
this relationship

19:06.417 --> 19:08.750
I asked you point-blank
if you had feelings for Dan.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.084
And I said no.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.375
What are you getting at?

19:12.375 --> 19:15.542
I just hope

got traded out by a piece
on the freakin' Hellcats?

28:17.166 --> 28:19.500
He's gonna figure out
my girlfriend was behind it.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.959
And he's gonna have me stuffed
and mounted on his wall.

Marti was never
in love with me.

-Did you ever read her diary?
-Uh, no.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.000
Well, she used to write
these little poems.

They were so sweet.

pretty lucid for Wanda.

something to ask--

34:17.208 --> 34:18.708
I'm asking you right now.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.250
Wanda seems to think
we're soulmates or something

34:22.250 --> 34:24.083
because of things
you supposedly told her.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.583
