-I think so.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.250
<c.speakerTop>I've got my lucky tamborita,

01:09.250 --> 01:11.166
<c.speakerTop>freshly ironed robe,
I conjured Zuzo--

01:11.166 --> 01:13.250
<c.speakerTop>You're ready.
We'll go on three.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.458
<c.speakerTop>-Three!
-What happened to one and two?

01:15.458 --> 01:17.375
<c.speakerTop>And there they go!

01:17.375 --> 01:20.375
<c.speakerTop>Off to battle a maze
of magical mayhem!

01:20.375 --> 01:23.166
<c.speaker>Vetzi!

01:23.166 --> 01:25.000
<c.speaker>Nice shot!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.583
<c.speaker>[elves chattering]

01:26.583 --> 01:29.083
<c.speaker>Ooh, a triple dose
of duendes!

01:31.458 --> 01:34.000
<c.speaker>Blit!
Vetzi!

01:35.583 --> 01:37.000
<c.speaker>Here they come
down the stretch!

01:37.000 --> 01:40.166
<c.speaker>It's looking like
they could go all the--!

01:40.166 --> 01:41.166
<c.speaker>[gasps]

01:41.166 --> 01:42.375
<c.speaker>Surprise!

<c.speaker>-[screams]

01:45.333 --> 01:47.416
<c.speaker>Esfurmarse!

01:48.458 --> 01:50.000
<c.speaker>[sighs]

01:50.000 --> 01:51.416
<c.speaker>Well, I'm sure
you'll get 'em next round!

01:51.416 --> 01:55.583
<c.speaker>[sighs] Maybe tomorrow.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.416
<c.speaker>I'm done for today.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.166
<c.speaker>[sighs]

02:03.166 --> 02:04.250
<c.speaker>[door opens]

02:04.250 --> 02:06.250
<c.speaker>We have to keep
practicing, Elena.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.458
<c.speaker>The oracle said
you have a big test coming!

02:08.458 --> 02:11.500
<c.speaker>And if you don't pass,
you won't become queen.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.708
<c.speaker>Trust me, I know,
but he didn't say

02:13.708 --> 02:15.875
<c.speaker>what the test was
or when it's even coming.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.250
<c.speaker>And then Victor and Carla
are still on the loose,

02:18.250 --> 02:21.333
<c.speaker>and it's just all...
a lot to deal with.

02:21.333 --> 02:25.083
<c.speaker>I guess that's why I froze up
when I saw their images.

02:25.083 --> 02:27.250
<c.speaker>Hey, hey, hey!

02:27.250 --> 02:29.875
<c.speaker>As a wise chanul once said,

02:29.875 --> 02:33.166
<c.speaker>you cannot worry
all your worries away.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.166
<c.speaker>Who said that?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.333
<c.speaker>I did. Just now.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.291
<c.speaker>Princess Elena,
we need your help!

02:37.291 --> 02:39.125
<c.speaker>We're making
sugar skull cookies

02:39.125 --> 02:41.208
<c.speaker>for tomorrow's
Día de los Muertos celebration,

02:41.208 --> 02:44.250
<c.speaker>but your abuelo is eating them
faster than we can make them!

02:44.250 --> 02:46.625
<c.speaker>I had to wrestle him
for this one.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.750
<c.speaker>I'll be right there.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.083
<c.speaker>Thank you!

02:50.291 --> 02:51.458
<c.speaker>Oh, that reminds me!

02:51.458 --> 02:52.875
<c.speaker>I need to go pick out
a tamborita

02:52.875 --> 02:54.500
<c.speaker>for my grandfather's altar.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.458
<c.speaker>I just wish I knew
which one was his favorite!

02:56.458 --> 02:57.875
<c.speaker>Well, if you really
want to know,

02:57.875 --> 02:59.458
<c.speaker>just have Elena ask him!

02:59.458 --> 03:01.500
<c.speaker>She has the power
to see ghosts.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.708
<c.speaker>You do?

03:02.708 --> 03:04.708
<c.speaker>Only on the Day
of the Dead.

03:04.708 --> 03:06.375
<c.speaker>That's still pretty amazing.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.833
<c.speaker>Now, if you only had
the power to stop worrying,

03:08.833 --> 03:11.375
<c.speaker>then you'd be all set!

03:11.375 --> 03:13.166
<c.speaker>All right, I'm gonna get
on back to the spirit world--

03:13.166 --> 03:14.625
<c.speaker>you know, try to beat
the holiday traffic.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.458
<c.speaker>See you next conjuring, Mateo!

03:16.458 --> 03:17.625
<c.speaker>High five!

03:17.625 --> 03:19.625
<c.speaker>Too alive!

03:19.625 --> 03:22.458
<c.speaker>Mateo, I'm decorating
my parents' altar
early tomorrow,

03:22.458 --> 03:24.083
<c.speaker>if you want to meet up.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.208
<c.speaker>I never got a chance
to talk to them last year,

03:26.208 --> 03:28.750
<c.speaker>and I could really
use their advice
about this test.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.458
<c.speaker>Whatever this test is,

03:30.458 --> 03:33.166
<c.speaker>there's nothing out there
you can't handle.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.416
<c.speaker>Here it is, Shuriki.

03:37.416 --> 03:40.333
<c.speaker>The magic in this jewel
will surely be enough

03:40.333 --> 03:42.875
<c.speaker>to forge a new wand.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.583
<c.speaker>Ha! We'll see
about that!

03:46.583 --> 03:50.083
<c.speaker>Magic from the great beyond,

03:50.083 --> 03:54.583
<c.speaker>turn this stone
into a wand.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.208
<c.speaker>Ha! Worthless!

04:08.208 --> 04:11.458
<c.speaker>Just like the rest.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.250
<c.speaker>Well, we got the jewel
you asked for,

04:13.250 --> 04:15.416
<c.speaker>so it's time to keep
your end of the deal.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.208
<c.speaker>Make us malvagos.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.416
<c.speaker>Carla!

04:18.416 --> 04:21.583
<c.speaker>I cannot make you
dark wizards without a wand!

04:21.583 --> 04:23.416
<c.speaker>So if you want
to be malvagos,

04:23.416 --> 04:26.208
<c.speaker>bring me a jewel
with real power!

04:26.208 --> 04:28.875
<c.speaker>But we've already searched
all of Avalor, Shuriki.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.458
<c.speaker>You haven't searched
Tepet Muul,

04:31.458 --> 04:34.083
<c.speaker>the pyramid city of Maru.

04:34.083 --> 04:39.416
<c.speaker>But, Shuriki, legend
has it that those pyramids
are haunted.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.000
<c.speaker>Legend also has it
that hidden

04:42.000 --> 04:44.625
<c.speaker>in a secret chamber
in the largest pyramid

04:44.625 --> 04:47.291
<c.speaker>is the Jewel of Maru,

04:47.291 --> 04:51.625
<c.speaker>the most powerful jewel
in all of Avalor!

04:51.625 --> 04:57.083
<c.speaker>Is there perhaps
a second-most-powerful jewel
we could search for?

04:57.083 --> 05:00.000
<c.speaker>This is the jewel
I need!

05:00.000 --> 05:03.125
<c.speaker>Get it for me
and I will make you malvagos.

05:03.125 --> 05:06.625
<c.speaker>Then we will take over
Avalor together.

05:06.625 --> 05:07.708
<c.speaker>[gasps]

05:07.708 --> 05:09.125
<c.speaker>Let's go, Papa!

<c.speaker>[Mateo] Morning, Elena!

07:58.750 --> 08:00.625
<c.speaker>Wow! Your altar
looks great!

08:00.625 --> 08:02.708
<c.speaker>-Thanks!
-Princess Elena!

08:02.708 --> 08:03.875
<c.speaker>Big news!

08:03.875 --> 08:06.458
<c.speaker>One of our scouts
spotted Victor and Carla.

08:06.458 --> 08:09.166
<c.speaker>Finally! We can't let them
get away this time.

08:09.166 --> 08:12.458
<c.speaker>You're going? But what about
seeing your parents?

08:12.458 --> 08:16.166
<c.speaker>I... want to see them,
but Victor and Carla...

08:16.166 --> 08:18.875
<c.speaker>[gasps] Catching them
could be my big test!

08:18.875 --> 08:20.708
<c.speaker>Your test
could be anything!

08:20.708 --> 08:23.458
<c.speaker>This is too important!
I have to go.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.291
<c.speaker>All right.
I'll go with you.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.750
<c.speaker>[Elena] Where were Victor
and Carla last seen?

08:31.750 --> 08:34.166
<c.speaker>Not too far from here,
near Tepet Muul.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.625
<c.speaker>Isn't that the place
with the haunted pyramids?

08:36.625 --> 08:38.250
<c.speaker>Hold up!
Did you say haunted?

08:38.250 --> 08:39.708
<c.speaker>'Cause I don't do haunted!

08:39.708 --> 08:43.250
<c.speaker>We'll be fine!
I can see ghosts.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.708
<c.speaker>Can you see that doesn't make me
feel any better?

08:49.125 --> 08:52.000
<c.speaker>Behold, Carla,
Tepet Muul,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.083
<c.speaker>the capital
of ancient Maru!

08:55.083 --> 08:56.583
<c.speaker>iAdelante!

09:03.291 --> 09:04.583
<c.speaker>Does anyone see them?

09:04.583 --> 09:06.166
<c.speaker>No, all clear here.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.500
<c.speaker>Okay, keep looking.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.000
<c.speaker>[Elena] There they are!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
<c.speaker>Walking right
into the haunted pyramid!

09:19.000 --> 09:20.708
<c.speaker>Boo. We can let
the ghosts catch 'em.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.625
<c.speaker>Uh-uh.
We're gonna catch 'em.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.708
<c.speaker>Whoa-ho-ho!

09:25.708 --> 09:27.458
<c.speaker>We will not fit
through there.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.708
<c.speaker>Guess it's just
you and me, Mateo.

09:31.708 --> 09:34.875
<c.speaker>Yes! I mean, it's good
because it's important

09:34.875 --> 09:36.833
<c.speaker>that we stand guard
out here.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.500
<c.speaker>Or maybe way over there.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.958
<c.speaker>[panting]

09:42.958 --> 09:45.166
<c.speaker>Victor and Carla
could be anywhere.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.083
<c.speaker>Which tunnel
do we take?

09:47.083 --> 09:49.125
<c.speaker>I don't know!

09:50.416 --> 09:51.875
<c.speaker>Reveal!

09:55.875 --> 09:57.250
<c.speaker>I don't see them!

09:57.250 --> 09:59.416
<c.speaker>The scepter is
sapping your energy.

09:59.416 --> 10:00.958
<c.speaker>You have to stop!

10:00.958 --> 10:03.000
<c.speaker>Let's just start
with that tunnel.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.875
<c.speaker>Ugh! Dead end!

10:11.875 --> 10:13.708
<c.speaker>What is that?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.750
<c.speaker>This pyramid
is haunted!

10:16.750 --> 10:18.708
<c.speaker>We have to get
out of here, Carla!

10:18.708 --> 10:20.833
<c.speaker>Get ahold
of yourself, Papa!

10:24.708 --> 10:26.416
<c.speaker>[Carla] Papa, stop!

10:26.416 --> 10:27.875
<c.speaker>We can't leave without it!

10:27.875 --> 10:29.708
<c.speaker>[Victor] But this place
is haunted!

10:29.708 --> 10:32.708
<c.speaker>[gasps] I hear them!
But I can't tell where
the sound is coming from.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.833
<c.speaker>-We have to split up!
-No way!

10:34.833 --> 10:36.875
<c.speaker>We'll have a better chance
of finding them.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.875
<c.speaker>Oh, all right.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.333
<c.speaker>[grunts]

10:47.333 --> 10:50.875
<c.speaker>What? It's an illusion?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
<c.speaker>Huh?

10:54.500 --> 10:56.583
<c.speaker>What's wrong with her?

10:56.583 --> 10:58.458
<c.speaker>These masks are scary.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.875
<c.speaker>Run, girl, run!

10:59.875 --> 11:01.833
<c.speaker>Why aren't you
running away?

11:01.833 --> 11:03.583
<c.speaker>Because I can see you.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.458
<c.speaker>You can see ghosts?

11:05.458 --> 11:08.458
<c.speaker>Yes, uh, but only
on Día de los Muertos.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.125
<c.speaker>Uh, who are you?

11:10.125 --> 11:12.208
<c.speaker>What are you doing
with the Scepter of Light?

11:12.208 --> 11:14.458
<c.speaker>Oh, um,
it's my royal scepter.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.375
<c.speaker>I'm Crown Princess Elena
of Avalor.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.750
<c.speaker>Oh, so that is what
this land is called now.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.750
<c.speaker>My name is Amaláy.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.208
<c.speaker>I was the last
royal wizard of Maru,

11:24.208 --> 11:27.000
<c.speaker>and it was I
who made that scepter.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.750
<c.speaker>You made it?

11:28.750 --> 11:32.750
<c.speaker>Wait, I-I thought
the Maruvians
disappeared years ago.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.000
<c.speaker>We did! Ghost.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.958
<c.speaker>Oh, right.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.750
<c.speaker>So, why are you haunting
this pyramid?

11:39.750 --> 11:42.125
<c.speaker>I must keep watch
over the Jewel of Maru,

11:42.125 --> 11:45.958
<c.speaker>a gem that is both
powerful and dangerous.

11:45.958 --> 11:48.458
<c.speaker>Many years ago,
the shadows of the night

11:48.458 --> 11:50.000
<c.speaker>broke through
from their world

11:50.000 --> 11:51.833
<c.speaker>and tried to destroy ours.

11:51.833 --> 11:55.208
<c.speaker>We only had one defense
powerful enough
to drive them back,

11:55.208 --> 11:58.083
<c.speaker>the Jewel of Maru.

11:58.083 --> 12:01.333
<c.speaker>The jewel's powers swept away
the forces of darkness,

12:01.333 --> 12:04.000
<c.speaker>but its power was so great
that it also sent

12:04.000 --> 12:05.875
<c.speaker>all of the Maruvians
to the spirit world.

12:05.875 --> 12:09.708
<c.speaker>The Kingdom of Maru
was no more.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.083
<c.speaker>So that's what happened
to the Maruvians!

12:12.083 --> 12:16.833
<c.speaker>And it can happen
to Avalor if the Jewel of Maru
falls into the wrong hands.

12:16.833 --> 12:20.083
<c.speaker>That is why I must frighten off
all who enter the pyramid.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.333
<c.speaker>[sighs] If only
I had the chance

12:22.333 --> 12:25.000
<c.speaker>to seal up the jewel
while I was still alive.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.500
<c.speaker>Hold on. There's a way
to seal up the jewel?

12:27.500 --> 12:31.000
<c.speaker>There is,
but only a living person--

12:31.000 --> 12:33.583
<c.speaker>Wait! You are alive.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.583
<c.speaker>Yeah! Last time I checked.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.958
<c.speaker>You have the scepter.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.958
<c.speaker>You can do it,
you could seal up the jewel!

12:38.958 --> 12:42.083
<c.speaker>[sighs] Okay, first,
you must hold the jewel.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.750
<c.speaker>Then, recite the incantation
on that wall.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.000
<c.speaker>Uh, there's nothing there?

12:48.000 --> 12:52.583
<c.speaker>Ah, I see you have
not mastered all of
the scepter's powers yet.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.250
<c.speaker>If you want to reveal
that which is hidden,

12:55.250 --> 12:57.583
<c.speaker>say "Illuminate!"

12:57.583 --> 12:59.333
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

12:59.333 --> 13:01.333
<c.speaker>[gasps]

13:01.333 --> 13:04.291
<c.speaker>Wait. Is that Maruvian?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.000
<c.speaker>I can't read Maruvian!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.125
<c.speaker>Does this thing have
a translation power?

13:08.125 --> 13:10.750
<c.speaker>[chuckles] No,
but I know Maruvian.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.291
<c.speaker>I can teach you the words.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.708
<c.speaker>Take hold of the jewel.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.000
<c.speaker>Repeat after me.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.875
<c.speaker>[speaking Maruvian]

13:20.875 --> 13:22.833
<c.speaker>Welty louwilly...

13:22.833 --> 13:25.583
<c.speaker>-[shouting]
-[gasps] That's Mateo!

13:25.583 --> 13:27.333
<c.speaker>I've gotta go.

13:27.333 --> 13:30.083
<c.speaker>But the incantation
isn't finished yet,

13:30.083 --> 13:32.000
<c.speaker>and you can only
see me today!

13:32.000 --> 13:33.291
<c.speaker>If we don't do this now,

13:33.291 --> 13:36.125
<c.speaker>what happened to Maru
could happen to Avalor.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.583
<c.speaker>My friend is in trouble.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.583
<c.speaker>I need to go,
but I'll come back!

13:39.583 --> 13:41.416
<c.speaker>Princess Elena!

13:43.375 --> 13:45.458
<c.speaker>[Carla] Get the tamborita!

13:45.458 --> 13:47.000
<c.speaker>Where are they?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.375
<c.speaker>Reveal!

13:48.375 --> 13:50.833
<c.speaker>Mateo!

13:52.166 --> 13:55.000
<c.speaker>Never get in the way
of the Delgados!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.958
<c.speaker>Now, let's get out
of here, Carla.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.958
<c.speaker>I'm not leaving
without that jewel!

14:03.875 --> 14:05.083
<c.speaker>[gasps]

14:05.083 --> 14:06.083
<c.speaker>Are you okay?

14:06.083 --> 14:07.416
<c.speaker>Don't worry about me.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.125
<c.speaker>Victor and Carla
ran up those stairs!

14:09.125 --> 14:10.375
<c.speaker>Got it!

14:10.375 --> 14:13.083
<c.speaker>They took my tamborita!
Be careful!

14:13.083 --> 14:14.875
<c.speaker>[groans in pain]

14:17.208 --> 14:19.000
<c.speaker>[both panting]

14:19.000 --> 14:23.166
<c.speaker>What? All the tunnels
lead to the same place!

14:23.166 --> 14:26.458
<c.speaker>-[both gasp]
-[Victor] Not the masks again!

14:26.458 --> 14:28.833
<c.speaker>[shrieks hysterically] Run!

14:28.833 --> 14:31.416
<c.speaker>No! Wait, Papa!

14:31.416 --> 14:33.375
<c.speaker>-[grunts]
-[gasps]

14:33.375 --> 14:35.583
<c.speaker>Hmm!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.500
<c.speaker>The wall was an illusion!

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
<c.speaker>Papa! Look!

14:39.500 --> 14:41.583
<c.speaker>-It's the jewel!
-No!

14:43.250 --> 14:44.875
<c.speaker>Thieves!

14:49.291 --> 14:50.708
<c.speaker>Carla!

14:50.708 --> 14:56.083
<c.speaker>[pants] Nothing...
is going to stop me!

14:56.083 --> 14:57.416
<c.speaker>No!

15:00.250 --> 15:01.375
<c.speaker>Stop right there!

15:01.375 --> 15:02.708
<c.speaker>Not a chance!

15:02.708 --> 15:03.833
<c.speaker>Blaze!

15:03.833 --> 15:04.958
<c.speaker>Aah!

15:06.875 --> 15:10.083
<c.speaker>-[panting]
-See ya, Princess.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.708
<c.speaker>Oh! The jewel!

15:16.958 --> 15:19.583
<c.speaker>[straining]

15:28.083 --> 15:30.083
<c.speaker>No...

15:50.250 --> 15:53.125
<c.speaker>Elenita.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.875
<c.speaker>Papi?

15:54.875 --> 15:56.250
<c.speaker>Mama?

15:56.250 --> 15:58.291
<c.speaker>You're-- you're here!

15:58.291 --> 16:01.458
<c.speaker>What happened?
Who did this to you?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.375
<c.speaker>I did this.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.958
<c.speaker>I think I just failed my test.

16:05.958 --> 16:07.625
<c.speaker>What test?

16:07.625 --> 16:10.000
<c.speaker>An oracle saw a vision
of my future.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.708
<c.speaker>If I don't pass a big test,
I won't become queen.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.125
<c.speaker>And how do you know
this was your test?

16:16.125 --> 16:19.125
<c.speaker>I just let Avalor's
worst criminals get away

16:19.125 --> 16:22.208
<c.speaker>with a very powerful
and dangerous jewel.

16:22.208 --> 16:24.583
<c.speaker>That is...
a rather large mistake.

16:24.583 --> 16:29.875
<c.speaker>Yes, but you still don't know
for certain this was the test.

16:29.875 --> 16:33.375
<c.speaker>Maybe it wasn't, but then again,
maybe it was!

16:33.375 --> 16:35.166
<c.speaker>I just don't know!

16:35.166 --> 16:37.250
<c.speaker>That's why I'm so worried
all the time.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.125
<c.speaker>Mija, when I was king
I faced many problems,

16:40.125 --> 16:41.708
<c.speaker>each and every day.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.375
<c.speaker>I could not worry about
which was more important.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.375
<c.speaker>I just did what I thought
was best for the kingdom.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.750
<c.speaker>And so should you.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.250
<c.speaker>You're right!

16:51.250 --> 16:53.416
<c.speaker>But I can't do anything
stuck in here!

16:53.416 --> 16:55.208
<c.speaker>So what?
You're giving up?

16:55.208 --> 16:57.375
<c.speaker>I have never
seen you give up.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.166
<c.speaker>Not even when
you were trapped

16:59.166 --> 17:01.708
<c.speaker>in that amulet
all those years.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.375
<c.speaker>I won't give up.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.291
<c.speaker>That is my Elenita.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.208
<c.speaker>[sighs, gasps]

17:27.208 --> 17:30.750
<c.speaker>Wait! Don't go.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.750
<c.speaker>Keep us close
to your heart,

17:32.750 --> 17:34.583
<c.speaker>and we will never be far.

17:34.583 --> 17:37.125
<c.speaker>We love you so much,
Elenita.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.458
<c.speaker>I love you, too.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.583
<c.speaker>[strains]

17:57.208 --> 17:59.000
<c.speaker>[strains]

18:00.708 --> 18:01.958
<c.speaker>Yes!

18:03.625 --> 18:05.125
<c.speaker>Blaze!

18:06.833 --> 18:08.208
<c.speaker>Elena!

18:08.208 --> 18:10.583
<c.speaker>Victor and Carla couldn't
have gotten too far.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.625
<c.speaker>Let's go.

18:14.875 --> 18:17.291
<c.speaker>[gasps] They're
getting away!

18:17.291 --> 18:19.875
<c.speaker>Wait! That's Mateo's
tamborita!

18:19.875 --> 18:22.166
<c.speaker>He and the princessa
must be in trouble.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.958
<c.speaker>What if they're hurt?

18:27.458 --> 18:30.708
<c.speaker>Look out, haunted pyramid,
here I come!

18:31.708 --> 18:34.708
<c.speaker>[grunting]

18:34.708 --> 18:37.708
<c.speaker>Uh, Skylar, I'm gonna need
a little nudge.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.833
<c.speaker>[grunting]

18:42.291 --> 18:44.875
<c.speaker>Come on, stop fooling
around and push!

18:44.875 --> 18:47.708
<c.speaker>I'm trying!
You're just too--!

18:47.708 --> 18:49.125
<c.speaker>Don't even go there.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.375
<c.speaker>[panting]

18:51.708 --> 18:53.583
<c.speaker>Luna, what are you doing?

18:53.583 --> 18:55.458
<c.speaker>Uh, saving you?

18:55.458 --> 18:58.291
<c.speaker>Come on, Mateo,
help me push her out.

18:58.291 --> 19:01.750
<c.speaker>[both grunting]

19:04.375 --> 19:07.875
<c.speaker>Jump on, Princessa!
I know which way they went.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.375
<c.speaker>They're coming!

19:21.500 --> 19:23.250
<c.speaker>Blaze!

19:23.250 --> 19:25.250
<c.speaker>[horse neighing]

19:25.250 --> 19:26.375
<c.speaker>[Carla] The jewel!

19:26.375 --> 19:28.583
<c.speaker>Aah! Ooh!

19:28.583 --> 19:29.833
<c.speaker>My tamborita!

19:29.833 --> 19:31.458
<c.speaker>I'll get it!

19:31.458 --> 19:34.083
<c.speaker>Forget the jewel.
Go, Carla, go!

19:35.375 --> 19:36.583
<c.speaker>Go after the jewel!

19:36.583 --> 19:37.708
<c.speaker>But they're getting away!

19:39.875 --> 19:42.125
<c.speaker>I need to return the jewel
to the pyramid

19:42.125 --> 19:44.208
<c.speaker>before Día
de los Muertos ends.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.375
<c.speaker>[stone crumbling]

19:47.375 --> 19:48.875
<c.speaker>Aah! It's falling!

19:48.875 --> 19:50.000
<c.speaker>Hold on!

19:51.375 --> 19:52.416
<c.speaker>[grunts]

19:54.875 --> 19:57.416
<c.speaker>[screaming]

20:05.375 --> 20:07.125
<c.speaker>They're gone.

20:07.125 --> 20:10.250
<c.speaker>I know, but this is what's
best for the kingdom.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.708
<c.speaker>You got the jewel!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.333
<c.speaker>We don't have much time.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.000
<c.speaker>Teach me the incantation.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
<c.speaker>Illuminate!

20:21.708 --> 20:23.500
<c.speaker>[speaking Maruvian]

20:23.500 --> 20:25.375
<c.speaker>Waili telitsli.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.458
<c.speaker>La wheli.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.750
<c.speaker>La wheli.

20:27.750 --> 20:28.750
<c.speaker>Y cawea.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.000
<c.speaker>Echowea.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.958
<c.speaker>[continues in Maruvian]

20:33.958 --> 20:35.708
<c.speaker>Senyowoh tonamit!

20:47.333 --> 20:49.750
<c.speaker>[chuckles]
Thank you, Elena.

20:49.750 --> 20:52.958
<c.speaker>You protected your kingdom
more than you know.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.333
<c.speaker>Now that
the Jewel of Maru is safe,

20:55.333 --> 20:57.708
<c.speaker>I am relieved
of my obligation.

20:57.708 --> 21:01.333
<c.speaker>I can finally pass forth
to the spirit world.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.458
<c.speaker>You'll finally
see your friends

21:03.458 --> 21:05.583
<c.speaker>and family again!

21:05.583 --> 21:08.000
<c.speaker>I have waited so long.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
<c.speaker>I know the feeling.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.583
<c.speaker>Until we meet again,

21:11.583 --> 21:13.291
<c.speaker>and I hope we do,

21:13.291 --> 21:16.250
<c.speaker>may the scepter
serve you well.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.416
<c.speaker>Looks like we're too late.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.083
<c.speaker>Everyone's gone.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.208
<c.speaker>How 'bout the ghosts?
Are they gone?

21:28.208 --> 21:29.500
<c.speaker>[laughs]
They're gone, too.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.458
<c.speaker>Día de los Muertos
is over.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.166
<c.speaker>Phew!

21:39.250 --> 21:42.125
<c.speaker>See you next year.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.958
<c.speaker>I'm sorry you
missed them, Elena.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.083
<c.speaker>I didn't.

22:03.625 --> 22:07.083
<c.speaker>♪♪
