00:02.562 --> 00:05.364
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to start clapping,

00:05.365 --> 00:07.366
'cause I just made
a major drug bust.

00:07.367 --> 00:10.169
Talking about four kilos
of cocaine,

00:10.170 --> 00:11.587
$200,000 cash,

00:11.588 --> 00:15.908
and my new partner,
a tarantula.

00:15.909 --> 00:18.577
I call him Jake Jr.,
aka spidey Klum,

00:18.578 --> 00:21.246
aka Mrs. doubtspider,
aka Joe spiden,

00:21.247 --> 00:24.550
aka tarantula basset,
aka spi-dermot mulrooney.

00:24.551 --> 00:26.585
- Aka tarantulina jolie.
- What?

00:26.586 --> 00:27.803
No, Charles,
have you seen this spider?

00:27.804 --> 00:29.021
That's a terrible name.
Sorry.

00:29.022 --> 00:30.139
Why do you have that thing?

00:30.140 --> 00:31.757
Because they were gonna
throw him away,

00:31.758 --> 00:33.809
but I couldn't do that
to my furry little... ah!

00:33.810 --> 00:35.060
He's actually
really scary up close.

00:35.061 --> 00:36.862
It's horrifying
from everywhere.

00:36.863 --> 00:38.197
Terry hates creepy crawlers.

00:38.198 --> 00:39.615
Seriously, I'm not going
to your apartment

00:39.616 --> 00:40.766
if that thing is there.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.451
All right, fine,
then he'll just live here

00:42.452 --> 00:43.769
and help me solve crimes.

00:43.770 --> 00:45.103
Get used to him, everyone,

00:45.104 --> 00:46.939
'cause me and this spider
are partners for life.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.157
He's gone.

00:48.158 --> 00:49.942
I left the cage unlocked,
and he's gone.

00:49.943 --> 00:50.943
Somebody find him!

00:50.944 --> 00:51.944
Stay off the ground!

00:51.945 --> 00:52.945
I'm good.

00:52.946 --> 00:53.963
I'm out of here.

00:53.964 --> 00:54.964
He couldn't have gone far...

00:54.965 --> 00:56.248
Unless he can fly.

00:56.249 --> 00:57.449
Can tarantulas fly?

00:57.450 --> 00:58.884
Jake, you better
find that spider.

00:58.885 --> 01:01.119
And I'm not coming back here
until you do.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.639
Uh, sarge, I think I found it.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.808
[Gasps]

01:05.809 --> 01:07.426
Why are you
looking at me like that?

01:07.427 --> 01:08.928
- <i> Oh, no.</i>
- <i> Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:08.929 --> 01:11.430
It's on my head!

01:11.431 --> 01:13.482

Hey, donut holes.

01:38.959 --> 01:41.043
Don't mind if I do.

01:41.044 --> 01:42.461
Ugh!

01:42.462 --> 01:43.712
Fish?

01:43.713 --> 01:44.797
Fish donuts, boyle?

01:44.798 --> 01:46.015
What is wrong with you?

01:46.016 --> 01:47.349
It's takoyaki.

01:47.350 --> 01:49.768
I'm drowning my sorrows
in octopus balls.

01:49.769 --> 01:52.170
I've been online dating;
It's a total disaster.

01:52.171 --> 01:53.389
I've only had one match,

01:53.390 --> 01:55.524
and it was a pretty obvious
catfish situation.

01:55.525 --> 01:56.976
My name yennifer.

01:56.977 --> 01:58.677
You give me social security?

01:58.678 --> 02:00.813
Oh, yennifer...

02:00.814 --> 02:02.815
Now, I see that
as a positive story.

02:02.816 --> 02:04.483
Out of all the identities
he could have stolen,

02:04.484 --> 02:06.201
he chose yours,
and you want to know why?

02:06.202 --> 02:07.686
Because I posted
my annual income?

02:07.687 --> 02:10.372
Because you posted
your annual income, you moron.

02:10.372 --> 02:12.041
Excuse me, is that takoyaki?

02:12.042 --> 02:13.876
Yeah, from senka,
right down the street.

02:13.877 --> 02:15.193
Oh, I love that place.

02:15.194 --> 02:17.963
The chef lets me take
octopus hearts home for my dogs.

02:17.964 --> 02:19.364
Oh, lucky!

02:19.365 --> 02:20.365
How many dogs do you have?

02:20.366 --> 02:21.884
Oh, too many.

02:21.885 --> 02:23.135
Three.
That's how many I have.

02:23.136 --> 02:24.136
Oh.

02:24.137 --> 02:25.254
All right, wait,
quick question.

02:25.255 --> 02:26.505
How do you keep them
off the bed?

02:26.506 --> 02:27.506
I gave up.

02:27.507 --> 02:29.475
I sleep on the floor.
Me too.

02:29.476 --> 02:30.709
Both: It's better for your back.

02:30.710 --> 02:31.710
[Laughter]

02:31.711 --> 02:32.711
Wow.

02:32.712 --> 02:36.515
Well, nice meeting you.

02:36.516 --> 02:37.516
What are you doing?

02:37.517 --> 02:38.517
She's walking away.

02:38.518 --> 02:39.518
I got nervous.

02:39.519 --> 02:40.519
She eats octopus balls,

02:40.520 --> 02:41.687
and she sleeps on the floor.

02:41.688 --> 02:42.888
She's the perfect woman.

02:42.889 --> 02:45.557
Oh, my God.

02:45.558 --> 02:48.160
Sorry, I was aiming
at somebody else,

02:48.161 --> 02:51.997
but now that I have
your attention, Charles?

02:51.998 --> 02:53.582
He was aiming
at a terrible cwim... criminal,

02:53.583 --> 02:54.733
he probably saved the world.

02:54.734 --> 02:56.201
Do you want to
have tak-takoyaki at the...

02:56.202 --> 02:57.503
um, on the bench over there?

02:57.504 --> 02:59.905
Sure, I was hoping you'd ask.

02:59.906 --> 03:01.406
My work here is done.

03:01.407 --> 03:02.791
Ugh, still fish.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.593
Oh, God.

03:04.594 --> 03:06.512
<i>Santiago, thank you</i>
<i>for coming in.</i>

03:06.513 --> 03:09.298
It's no secret the NYPD
has an image problem.

03:09.299 --> 03:11.850
Yeah, when I told
my garbage man I was a cop,

03:11.851 --> 03:13.519
he said, "gross."

03:13.520 --> 03:15.587
He had someone else's
band-aid stuck to him.

03:15.588 --> 03:17.723
Police approval ratings
are... pardon my language...

03:17.724 --> 03:18.891
in the commode.

03:18.892 --> 03:21.110
All the headlines
are about the bad cops,

03:21.111 --> 03:22.695
but there are good cops too,

03:22.696 --> 03:25.948
and I want to put up posters
that showcase some of our best.

03:25.949 --> 03:27.700
I'd like you to be
on the first one.

03:27.701 --> 03:29.702
Shut up, ray.

03:29.703 --> 03:32.537
I mean, interesting, captain.

03:32.538 --> 03:33.538
I'll think about it.

03:33.539 --> 03:35.891
Wow, this is a bad idea.

03:35.892 --> 03:38.727
First off, Amy has
an epic lack of swagger.

03:38.728 --> 03:41.346
Uh, I'll have you know
I have swagger.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.983
I ooze swagger.

03:44.984 --> 03:46.051
Right.

03:46.052 --> 03:47.219
More importantly,

03:47.220 --> 03:49.221
putting up a bunch of photos
of smiling cops

03:49.222 --> 03:51.190
isn't gonna change
how people feel about us.

03:51.191 --> 03:53.275
I think this campaign
is very promising.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.493
Santiago, what's your take?

03:54.494 --> 03:56.862
Oh, right, let's hear
an unbiased opinion

03:56.863 --> 03:58.330
from your straight-up swimfan.

03:58.331 --> 03:59.731
[Scoffs]

03:59.732 --> 04:02.067
I think it's a great idea, sir.

04:02.068 --> 04:04.620
Well, you can count me out.

04:04.621 --> 04:06.571
I will not pose
for your posters.

04:06.572 --> 04:09.407
I didn't ask you,
and you're not a police officer.

04:09.408 --> 04:11.743
Yeah, I'm out.

04:14.264 --> 04:17.349
Sarge, permission to arrest
Hitchcock and Scully.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.184
I told you before,
it's not harassment

04:19.185 --> 04:21.136
unless you can
prove intent to fart.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.471
No, it's not that.

04:22.472 --> 04:23.755
They robbed me.

04:23.756 --> 04:25.023
They ate my moose tracks
ice cream.

04:25.024 --> 04:26.024
[Laughs]

04:26.025 --> 04:27.142
That's funny.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.610
I wouldn't think
you like moose tracks.

04:28.611 --> 04:29.945
My boyfriend Marcus
introduced me to it.

04:29.946 --> 04:31.146
- [Laughs]
- What?

04:31.147 --> 04:33.866
It is a delicious treat
for all ages.

04:33.867 --> 04:35.451
Damn, rosa, okay.

04:35.452 --> 04:37.703
Look, I think they've been
skimming people's desserts

04:37.704 --> 04:39.371
for weeks,
but I can never prove it.

04:39.372 --> 04:40.823
Did you see them
take your ice cream?

04:40.824 --> 04:43.575
No, but Hitchcock has
fudge stains all over his chest.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.994
He's always got fudge stains
all over his chest.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.463
- Ugh.
- They'll deny everything.

04:47.464 --> 04:48.964
We need hard proof.

04:48.965 --> 04:50.799
So let's get it.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.835
Step one: Put a delicious
pie in the fridge

04:52.836 --> 04:54.169
and cover it with poison.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.420
That's step one?

04:55.421 --> 04:56.505
What's step two?

04:56.506 --> 04:58.056
Tell their widows
they were thieves.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.144
Hey, where'd she go?

05:02.145 --> 05:03.345
You guys were hitting it off.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.463
I half expected to see you
sitting in her lap by now.

05:05.464 --> 05:07.465
She is amazing.

05:07.466 --> 05:09.401
Her palate is wide and deep.
Gross.

05:09.402 --> 05:11.270
And at one point
when she wasn't looking,

05:11.271 --> 05:12.571
I snuck a whiff of her hair.

05:12.572 --> 05:13.638
Of course you did.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.807
- She uses one of my
top three shampoos:

05:15.808 --> 05:17.809
Tahitian coconut, extra lather.

05:17.810 --> 05:18.810
Sounds good, boyle.

05:18.811 --> 05:20.946
- Did you get her number?
- Oh, we lost track of time.

05:20.947 --> 05:22.581
She had to go back into court.

05:22.582 --> 05:25.000
When she's done,
I'm gonna ask her out.

05:25.001 --> 05:26.151
Oh, okay, okay.

05:26.152 --> 05:27.252
So what's the plan?

05:27.253 --> 05:28.486
Going straight from here
to the spa.

05:28.487 --> 05:29.487
Couples massage.

05:29.488 --> 05:30.539
Okay, seems a little intense,

05:30.540 --> 05:32.040
but given how your
other weirdness lined up,

05:32.041 --> 05:33.658
I say go for it.

05:33.659 --> 05:34.843
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, okay.

05:34.844 --> 05:36.211
How do I look?
You look great.

05:36.212 --> 05:38.847
I've got a good
feeling about this.

05:38.848 --> 05:40.665
Genevieve, I know we just met,

05:40.666 --> 05:41.800
and I don't want
to be too forward...

05:41.801 --> 05:42.801
Charles.

05:42.802 --> 05:43.802
But sometimes you just get

05:43.803 --> 05:44.803
a feeling about a person....

05:44.804 --> 05:45.837
Charles.

05:45.838 --> 05:46.889
And I've got
that feeling about you.

05:46.890 --> 05:48.223
I like you...
Charles, look down.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.224
I think tonight we...

05:49.225 --> 05:50.559
oh, shoot.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.895
They just gave me
ten years in prison.

05:59.152 --> 06:00.819
She didn't say no.

06:03.942 --> 06:05.242
Hey, buddy.

06:05.243 --> 06:07.328
Got you some of those
fish donuts you like so much

06:07.329 --> 06:08.662
to cheer you up.

06:08.663 --> 06:09.830
Although, full disclosure,

06:09.831 --> 06:10.898
I couldn't find
where they sold them,

06:10.899 --> 06:12.199
so that's just
a chocolate éclair

06:12.200 --> 06:13.417
with lox on it.

06:13.418 --> 06:15.086
Oh, thanks, Jake,
but I don't need cheering up.

06:15.087 --> 06:16.087
You can eat it yourself.

06:16.088 --> 06:17.371
Nope.

06:17.372 --> 06:18.706
So what, you're not upset
about falling hard

06:18.707 --> 06:20.091
for a lady who was
immediately thrown in jail?

06:20.092 --> 06:22.126
No, because she's
not actually guilty.

06:22.127 --> 06:23.677
They say she robbed
her own art gallery

06:23.678 --> 06:26.046
for the insurance money,
but that makes no sense.

06:26.047 --> 06:27.932
She would have made more
if the art had sold.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.800
This piece,
"breastfeeding knight,"

06:29.801 --> 06:32.085
was worth twice what she got
from the insurance company.

06:32.086 --> 06:33.104
Wow, look at that.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.522
Not to sound
overly intellectual,

06:34.523 --> 06:37.391
but dem knight boobies
is crazy.

06:37.392 --> 06:38.776
[Laughs] I get art.

06:38.777 --> 06:41.028
Also, I talked to
Genevieve's lawyer.

06:41.029 --> 06:42.780
He's a total disaster.

06:42.781 --> 06:44.982
I have a couple questions about
a beautiful client of yours,

06:44.983 --> 06:46.233
Genevieve mirren-Carter.

06:46.234 --> 06:48.369
She got hit by a tow truck
and sued the driver?

06:48.370 --> 06:49.787
No, she was accused
of insurance fraud.

06:49.788 --> 06:52.990
Oh, good, because I blew
that tow truck case.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.608
Straight-up forgot
to go to court.

06:54.609 --> 06:56.994
Well, they found one of the
stolen paintings at her house.

06:56.995 --> 06:58.662
But she said she didn't
know how it ended up there.

06:58.663 --> 07:00.164
She's being set up.
Framed.

07:00.165 --> 07:01.298
Art joke.
Continue.

07:01.299 --> 07:03.116
My hunch is that it's
a jealous ex-lover.

07:03.117 --> 07:06.303
A girl like that, three dogs,
makes her own turkey stock,

07:06.304 --> 07:08.839
that's the kind of woman
you don't get over.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.891
Look, I know you think
my judgment's clouded

07:10.892 --> 07:12.009
because I like her
a little bit...

07:12.010 --> 07:13.594
You doodled your
wedding invitation.

07:13.595 --> 07:15.262
No, that's our joint tombstone.

07:15.263 --> 07:16.263
My mistake.

07:16.264 --> 07:17.631
But as a cop, I really don't

07:17.632 --> 07:19.400
think that she did it.

07:19.401 --> 07:21.819
Something is off
about the case.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.303
Okay, boyle.

07:23.304 --> 07:25.806
I trust your gut.

07:25.807 --> 07:27.158
Let's go free
an innocent woman.

07:27.159 --> 07:28.159
Nice!

07:28.160 --> 07:29.827
My dreams are coming true.

07:29.828 --> 07:33.664
You and me getting
my lady off together.

07:33.665 --> 07:35.666
I mean, you know
how that sounds, right?

07:37.202 --> 07:39.486
Look strong but fair.

07:39.487 --> 07:40.487
But approachable.

07:40.488 --> 07:41.488
But professional.

07:41.489 --> 07:42.673
And fun.

07:42.674 --> 07:43.757
But not too fun.

07:43.758 --> 07:44.758
This is your job.

07:44.759 --> 07:46.043
Can you handle all that?

07:46.044 --> 07:49.013
Sir, "fun but not too fun"
was my campaign slogan

07:49.014 --> 07:50.714
when I ran for prom queen.

07:50.715 --> 07:52.183
Did you win?

07:52.184 --> 07:53.267
No.

07:53.268 --> 07:54.268
Ames?

07:54.269 --> 07:55.553
I want to say you look great.

07:55.554 --> 07:56.554
Thank you.

07:56.555 --> 07:57.555
You didn't let me finish.

07:57.556 --> 07:58.556
Dot, dot, dot,

07:58.557 --> 07:59.673
for you.

07:59.674 --> 08:01.174
Great news is,
it doesn't matter,

08:01.175 --> 08:02.560
because this campaign,

08:02.561 --> 08:04.645
like three out of five
backstreet boys,

08:04.646 --> 08:06.063
is inconsequential.

08:06.064 --> 08:07.147
That's enough, Gina.

08:07.148 --> 08:08.649
All I'm saying as a...
if not the...

08:08.650 --> 08:11.869
voice of the streets is,
this tisn't gonna work.

08:11.870 --> 08:13.904
And all I'm saying as a...
if not the...

08:13.905 --> 08:15.706
boss here is,
if you're not gonna support me,

08:15.707 --> 08:16.707
you can leave.

08:16.708 --> 08:17.708
Fine.

08:17.709 --> 08:18.792
I will leave.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.694
I'm gonna go get
a mani-pedi,

08:20.695 --> 08:23.497
and I'm gonna do some
serious subtweeting,

08:23.498 --> 08:24.832
so you might want to

08:24.833 --> 08:26.383
[whispering] Keep off the net.

08:28.202 --> 08:29.202
Diaz.

08:29.203 --> 08:30.337
Look what I found

08:30.338 --> 08:32.506
in Hitchcock and Scully's
trash can:

08:32.506 --> 08:33.557
Ice cream spoon.

08:33.558 --> 08:35.558
Son of a bitch.

08:37.544 --> 08:40.881
You hungry, hungry hippos
ate my ice cream.

08:40.881 --> 08:42.933
Why was this in your trash?

08:42.933 --> 08:44.602
And who throws away a spoon?

08:44.603 --> 08:46.553
It's the easiest
utensil to clean.

08:46.554 --> 08:48.388
I don't even think
it's ice cream.

08:48.389 --> 08:49.773
It's probably medicine.

08:49.774 --> 08:52.493
You know, I'm on
lots of medicines, rosa.

08:52.494 --> 08:54.895
I'm sick all over.

08:54.896 --> 08:57.564
This is ice cream,
and I'm gonna prove it.

08:57.565 --> 08:58.866
Sarge, no.

08:58.867 --> 08:59.867
It's been in their mouths.

08:59.868 --> 09:00.951
What am I doing?

09:00.952 --> 09:02.453
Well, I guess
your little investigation

09:02.454 --> 09:03.737
has hit a dead end.

09:03.738 --> 09:06.406
I'll be back.

09:06.407 --> 09:09.076
Don't move.

09:09.077 --> 09:10.794
Not a problem.

09:10.795 --> 09:13.547
I hate moving.

09:13.548 --> 09:15.049
Let it go.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.467
Let it go.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.768
<i>Interesting.</i>

09:17.769 --> 09:21.138
<i>Yeah, something definitely</i>
<i>doesn't add up.</i>

09:21.139 --> 09:23.974
Did you know there's
a sausage you can drink?

09:23.975 --> 09:24.975
What?

09:24.976 --> 09:26.477
Are you even talking
about the case?

09:26.478 --> 09:27.761
We got distracted.

09:27.762 --> 09:28.812
She has an amazing tongue.

09:28.813 --> 09:31.282
Strong, supple,
great bud density.

09:31.283 --> 09:32.766
Okay, I'm gonna
take over the questioning.

09:32.767 --> 09:33.951
Yeah, I'm too close to this.

09:33.952 --> 09:35.069
Disgusting eating habits.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.070
<i>Hi, Genevieve.</i>

09:36.071 --> 09:37.071
<i>I'm just gonna ask you</i>

09:37.072 --> 09:38.205
<i>a couple of questions now,</i>

09:38.206 --> 09:40.658
<i>and detective boyle</i>
<i>will just sit there</i>

09:40.659 --> 09:42.126
<i>and keep waving at you,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

09:42.127 --> 09:43.276
<i>Now then, is there anybody</i>

09:43.277 --> 09:44.461
<i>you can think of</i>
<i>besides yourself</i>

09:44.462 --> 09:46.297
<i>that has access</i>
<i>to the gallery after hours?</i>

09:46.298 --> 09:47.965
<i>No, just me, and the vault is</i>

09:47.966 --> 09:50.134
<i>only accessible</i>
<i>through fingerprint ID.</i>

09:50.135 --> 09:51.802
<i>Does Charles have a girlfriend?</i>

09:51.803 --> 09:52.803
I just saw her mouth my name.

09:52.804 --> 09:53.921
What did she say?

09:53.922 --> 09:55.255
Is she asking
if I'm circumcised?

09:55.256 --> 09:56.289
What?
No.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.290
Who asks that?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.959
Stop interrupting.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.960
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

09:59.961 --> 10:00.961
<i>Okay, next question.</i>

10:00.962 --> 10:02.146
<i>Can you think of anyone</i>

10:02.147 --> 10:03.463
<i>that might be</i>
<i>trying to set you up?</i>

10:03.464 --> 10:05.733
<i>Maybe an employee</i>
<i>or a rival of some kind?</i>

10:05.734 --> 10:07.467
<i>Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick.</i>

10:07.468 --> 10:09.320
<i>He's an artist, a terrible one.</i>

10:09.321 --> 10:11.355
<i>He was always in debt</i>
<i>and begging for money.</i>

10:11.356 --> 10:12.573
<i>That's why we broke up.</i>

10:12.574 --> 10:13.991
<i>Maybe he's resentful.</i>

10:13.992 --> 10:15.075
Dirtbag ex.

10:15.076 --> 10:16.527
Oh, that was
my theory, remember?

10:16.528 --> 10:17.528
Tell her it was my theory.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.529
- Okay.
- Wait, give me a second.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.780
I want to look smart
when you say it.

10:19.781 --> 10:21.115
Okay.

10:21.116 --> 10:22.333
<i>Uh, hey, Genevieve,</i>

10:22.334 --> 10:23.751
<i>detective boyle wanted me</i>
<i>to let you know</i>

10:23.752 --> 10:26.203
<i>that he, a college graduate,</i>
<i>had a similar theory</i>

10:26.204 --> 10:27.705
<i>that it could have been</i>
<i>an ex-boyfriend.</i>

10:27.706 --> 10:28.756
<i>Wow.</i>

10:28.757 --> 10:29.873
<i>He is so smart.</i>

10:29.874 --> 10:31.324
Wow, it actually worked.

10:31.325 --> 10:32.710
I've got to
hand it to you, buddy

10:32.711 --> 10:34.044
whatever you're putting down,
she is picking up.

10:34.045 --> 10:35.429
Oh, good.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.381
Oh, one more thing.
<i>Boyle has another question.</i>

10:37.382 --> 10:38.682
Tell her when this is all over,

10:38.683 --> 10:40.000
I'm gonna rub her body
in pã¢tã©,

10:40.001 --> 10:41.501
and then rub it off her
with a cornichon.

10:41.502 --> 10:42.553
I'm just gonna
give the phone back.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.971
Okay.

10:43.972 --> 10:44.972
<i>Hi.</i>

10:47.525 --> 10:49.360
Guard got nauseous,
so we had to stop.

10:49.361 --> 10:50.510
Hmm, that's weird.

10:50.511 --> 10:51.645
Do you think it's because
you're the two

10:51.646 --> 10:52.696
most disgusting people
in the universe?

10:52.697 --> 10:54.448
- Could be.
- Yeah, check this out.

10:54.449 --> 10:56.283
Remember the ex-boyfriend
that she mentioned, Nick?

10:56.284 --> 10:57.684
Call him Mr. butthead.

10:57.685 --> 10:59.236
Okay, well,
apparently Mr. butthead

10:59.237 --> 11:02.072
just bought a brand-new gallery
in dumbo to showcase his art,

11:02.073 --> 11:03.407
which is weird,
because Genevieve said

11:03.408 --> 11:04.825
he was always in debt.

11:04.826 --> 11:08.195
Looks like somebody just
came into a ton of money.

11:08.196 --> 11:09.529
Oh, and you think
she's gonna want to

11:09.530 --> 11:11.364
get back together with him
now that he's rich.

11:11.365 --> 11:12.866
Damn it!
No, boyle.

11:12.867 --> 11:15.169
He probably got the cash
from selling the stolen art.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.303
Your hunch was right.

11:16.304 --> 11:17.588
Yeah, it was.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.808
? my hunch, my hunch,
my lovely case-y hunch ?

11:20.809 --> 11:21.892
come on, Jake, sing with me.

11:21.893 --> 11:22.893
That's not gonna happen.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.144
I will literally never...

11:24.145 --> 11:25.712
? whatcha gonna do
with all that hunch ?

11:25.713 --> 11:27.547
? all that hunch
inside your brain ?

11:27.548 --> 11:29.216
both: ? we're gonna solve,
solve, solve this case ?

11:29.217 --> 11:32.019
? solve this case
right in your face ?

11:32.020 --> 11:33.570
we should probably
leave this prison.

11:33.571 --> 11:34.571
Yep.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.900
Okay, here's my cover.

11:38.901 --> 11:40.669
My name is sherwin lemonde,

11:40.670 --> 11:42.955
sculptor, painter,
full-time barista.

11:42.956 --> 11:46.124
But once I sell my first piece,
part-time barista.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.125
Oh, nice.

11:47.126 --> 11:49.795
I'm Donald hoberman-seitz.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.413
I wear glasses.

11:51.414 --> 11:52.464
Is that all you got?

11:52.465 --> 11:54.967
Sorry, I spent
the cab ride here imagining

11:54.968 --> 11:56.435
me and Genevieve kissing.

11:56.436 --> 11:58.103
Okay, just let me
do the talking.

11:58.104 --> 11:59.104
Wine?

11:59.105 --> 12:00.806
Yes, thank you so much.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.357
Oh, wow, I love your outfit.

12:02.358 --> 12:03.592
I'm an artist,
so I get that it's

12:03.593 --> 12:04.943
more than just tight.

12:04.944 --> 12:06.862
Nick likes to
coat women in latex.

12:06.863 --> 12:09.198
He's fascinated by the idea
of the human chrysalis

12:09.199 --> 12:10.616
in society's pupation.

12:10.617 --> 12:11.617
Hmm, cool.

12:11.618 --> 12:13.035
Human chrysalis and whatnot.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.103
Yeah, whatnot.

12:15.104 --> 12:16.104
It's a whatnot.

12:16.105 --> 12:18.440
Yeah, yeah.

12:18.441 --> 12:19.875
I have no idea
what a chrysalis is,

12:19.876 --> 12:20.876
but serious question:

12:20.877 --> 12:21.877
If she farts in that thing,

12:21.878 --> 12:23.078
does it blow up like a balloon?

12:23.079 --> 12:24.129
You have to assume
that it would.

12:24.130 --> 12:25.130
You have to, right?

12:25.131 --> 12:26.415
- Yeah.
- Art is so intense.

12:26.416 --> 12:27.749
It really is.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.084
Look, there's Nick.

12:32.388 --> 12:33.505
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

12:33.506 --> 12:34.590
- Is this your work?
- Yes.

12:34.591 --> 12:35.924
It's good.

12:35.925 --> 12:37.726
I haven't talked to anyone here,
but it almost seems like

12:37.727 --> 12:39.461
you're going for
a human chrysalis thing.

12:39.462 --> 12:40.729
I'm glad you like it.

12:40.730 --> 12:43.465
I wish I could take credit,
but this is society.

12:43.466 --> 12:44.799
I'm just holding up the mirror.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.968
Hmm?

12:46.969 --> 12:48.303
Wow.

12:48.304 --> 12:49.855
You meant that literally.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.106
Very cool.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.609
Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist
named sherwin.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.193
I'm Donald hoberman-seitz.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.945
I wear glasses.

12:56.946 --> 12:57.946
So anyway, I was wondering.

12:57.947 --> 12:58.947
How'd you get your own gallery?

12:58.948 --> 13:00.032
It must be really expensive.

13:00.033 --> 13:01.700
Art's not about the money, man.

13:01.701 --> 13:02.751
Totally.

13:02.752 --> 13:05.487
It's more about
the other things.

13:05.488 --> 13:06.705
Right on.

13:06.706 --> 13:09.458
This painting is called
"Genevieve 416."

13:09.459 --> 13:10.459
What's that all about?

13:10.460 --> 13:11.793
Well, April 16th was the day

13:11.794 --> 13:14.296
my ex, Genevieve, and I
covered ourselves with paint

13:14.297 --> 13:16.632
and made love on that canvas
for 24 hours straight.

13:16.633 --> 13:17.966
That's pretty pathetic, dude.

13:17.967 --> 13:20.018
You seem pretty obsessed
with Genevieve, huh?

13:20.019 --> 13:21.470
- Excuse me?
- Donald.

13:21.471 --> 13:23.505
I bet it really hurt
when she dumped you.

13:23.506 --> 13:25.006
- What?
- Donald, your glasses.

13:25.007 --> 13:26.775
Where were you July 21st,
Mr. butthead?

13:26.776 --> 13:27.776
Uh...

13:27.777 --> 13:29.444
[Mocking] Uh, duh, uh...

13:29.445 --> 13:31.480
You were robbing
Genevieve's gallery.

13:31.481 --> 13:32.514
You framed her,

13:32.515 --> 13:33.949
and I should
arrest you right now.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.033
- What are you, cops?
- What?

13:35.034 --> 13:36.952
No, we're artists.

13:36.953 --> 13:38.904
And as artists,
we question everything,

13:38.905 --> 13:41.540
including certain people's
whereabouts on particular dates.

13:41.541 --> 13:42.541
Get out of here.

13:42.542 --> 13:43.909
Fine, but we're taking this,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.494
because you don't
deserve that memory.

13:45.495 --> 13:46.878
That painting is $95,000.

13:46.879 --> 13:47.879
I don't want it anyway.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.048
Your penis was on it.

13:50.049 --> 13:51.049
Sorry about that.

13:51.050 --> 13:52.718
Donald is...

13:52.719 --> 13:53.719
Sucks.

13:55.722 --> 13:57.389
Hey, you dum-dums.

13:57.390 --> 13:58.640
Ice cream.

13:58.641 --> 14:00.892
Moose tracks ice cream.

14:00.893 --> 14:02.377
How do you know?

14:02.378 --> 14:04.146
Yep, it's definitely ice cream.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.564
- Knew it!
- They're going down.

14:05.565 --> 14:09.234
Also, whoever used this spoon,
their body ain't right.

14:09.235 --> 14:10.852
Okay, let's say
it is ice cream.

14:10.853 --> 14:12.988
But I didn't eat it;
I couldn't have.

14:12.989 --> 14:14.439
I'm lactose intolerant.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.557
Me too.

14:15.558 --> 14:17.559
I'm super lactose intolerant.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
You're lying.

14:18.561 --> 14:19.995
Have you ever
seen us eat dairy?

14:19.996 --> 14:22.331
You know no one can bear
to watch you eat.

14:22.332 --> 14:23.749
Check.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.250
And...

14:25.251 --> 14:26.752
Check.

14:26.753 --> 14:28.503
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

14:28.504 --> 14:30.071
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

14:30.072 --> 14:31.790
I got to say, boyle.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.408
Nick was pretty defensive.

14:33.409 --> 14:35.344
Yeah, and he's
a terrible artist.

14:35.345 --> 14:37.462
All he does is
have sex on canvases.

14:37.463 --> 14:40.098
Any fourth grader
could do that.

14:40.099 --> 14:42.184
But...

14:42.185 --> 14:43.185
They shouldn't.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.353
No.

14:44.354 --> 14:46.355
Hey, Nick doesn't like cops,

14:46.356 --> 14:47.589
but he didn't do anything wrong.

14:47.590 --> 14:48.774
And how would you know?

14:48.775 --> 14:50.609
I'm his assistant, dvora.

14:50.610 --> 14:51.926
He would never
set up Genevieve.

14:51.927 --> 14:53.145
He's still in love with her.

14:53.146 --> 14:55.280
He keeps boxes of
her old stuff lying around.

14:55.281 --> 14:57.616
Ooh, can we look at,
smell, and handle them?

14:57.617 --> 14:58.950
I mean, you know,
for the investigation.

14:58.951 --> 15:00.452
We're cops.

15:00.453 --> 15:01.703
Please, take the boxes.

15:01.704 --> 15:02.704
I want them out of here.

15:02.705 --> 15:04.039
Oh, okay, great.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.157
You wouldn't happen
to know where he was

15:05.158 --> 15:06.491
on July 21st, would you?

15:06.492 --> 15:07.626
Actually, I would.

15:07.627 --> 15:09.944
He did a performance art piece
that entire month.

15:09.945 --> 15:12.464
He lived in a cage on the street
and never left it.

15:12.465 --> 15:13.548
The whole thing's on video.

15:13.549 --> 15:14.800
Okay, great.

15:14.801 --> 15:15.801
Totally.

15:15.802 --> 15:16.951
We'll just go around back

15:16.952 --> 15:18.470
and pick up the boxes.

15:18.471 --> 15:20.138
Oh, one more thing.

15:20.139 --> 15:22.474
Where in this "cage"
did he go to the bathroom?

15:22.475 --> 15:23.558
- Bucket.
- Okay, gross.

15:23.559 --> 15:24.559
Have a good night.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.897
Sir, I saw my poster
on the subway this morning.

15:28.898 --> 15:30.482
Well, you must feel
like a celebrity,

15:30.483 --> 15:32.267
a regular ira glass.

15:32.268 --> 15:36.805
They put a Hitler
mustache on me.

15:36.806 --> 15:38.940
Yes, this is unfortunate,

15:38.941 --> 15:41.026
but let's not overreact
to one graffito.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.577
It wasn't just one.

15:42.578 --> 15:45.280
People drew on
every single poster.

15:45.281 --> 15:48.983
They put devil horns,
target on my face,

15:48.984 --> 15:51.536
this one says, "die pig,"
and worst of all,

15:51.537 --> 15:53.655
they didn't put the comma
between "die" and "pig."

15:53.656 --> 15:54.989
This is easily dealt with.

15:54.990 --> 15:56.041
I'll just issue
a statement saying

15:56.042 --> 15:57.626
vandals will be prosecuted.

15:57.627 --> 15:59.711
It's not just vandalism, sir.

15:59.712 --> 16:02.214
People have
real complaints too.

16:02.215 --> 16:03.498
"End stop and frisks.

16:03.499 --> 16:04.833
"Stop racial profiling.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.135
Unlawful arrest is a crime."

16:07.136 --> 16:08.270
I see.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.105
I think Gina was right
about the campaign, sir.

16:10.106 --> 16:11.673
Hmm.

16:11.674 --> 16:14.109
I'm surprised she hasn't marched
in here to say, "I told you so."

16:14.110 --> 16:15.444
She wouldn't do that.

16:15.445 --> 16:17.562
You're right, Amy.

16:17.563 --> 16:19.981
For once in your life,
you're 100% right.

16:19.982 --> 16:21.683
I would never say that.

16:26.956 --> 16:29.290
Did you have enough time
to read it all?

16:29.291 --> 16:30.342
Yes.

16:30.343 --> 16:31.643
Okay, good.

16:31.644 --> 16:33.562
Yep, it's true.

16:33.563 --> 16:34.980
He sat in a cage for a month.

16:34.981 --> 16:36.832
Eww, the bucket checks out.

16:36.833 --> 16:37.833
This is insane.

16:37.834 --> 16:38.934
Anything is art.

16:38.935 --> 16:40.035
Here, watch this.

16:40.036 --> 16:42.037
A statue of Jesus
made out of cigarette butts.

16:42.038 --> 16:43.371
Boom, I'm a millionaire.

16:43.372 --> 16:45.006
- That's actually pretty good.
- I know.

16:45.007 --> 16:46.341
And I I could
call it "holy smokes."

16:46.342 --> 16:47.559
Should we really do this?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.060
No, right?

16:49.061 --> 16:50.762
That's crazy; You can't just
become an artist out of nowhere.

16:50.763 --> 16:51.763
- Jake.
- What?

16:51.764 --> 16:53.014
- The case.
- Yeah.

16:53.015 --> 16:54.149
So Nick has an alibi;
That's not great.

16:54.150 --> 16:55.350
But we have a box

16:55.351 --> 16:57.068
of Genevieve's stuff
from the gallery.

16:57.069 --> 16:58.904
I'm sure there's something
in here that will exonerate her.

16:58.905 --> 17:00.438
- Right.
- Oh, my God.

17:00.439 --> 17:02.107
Socks and shoes.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.276
This is exactly
the type of stuff I own.

17:04.277 --> 17:06.060
This is kismet.

17:06.060 --> 17:07.829
Oh, no, what's this?

17:07.829 --> 17:09.196
It's a receipt
for a storage unit

17:09.198 --> 17:10.832
that she didn't
tell anyone about.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.117
- It's probably nothing.
- Yeah.

17:12.117 --> 17:13.167
Yeah, yeah.

17:13.169 --> 17:14.169
I'm sure it's nothing.
Yeah.

17:14.170 --> 17:15.420
- It's totally nothing.
- No.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.875
It's a bunch of stolen art.

17:19.876 --> 17:20.876
[Sighs]

17:24.327 --> 17:25.794
Hey, buddy.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.795
Sorry about Genevieve.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.863
It's okay.

17:27.864 --> 17:29.698
I'm resigned to
my life of solitude.

17:29.699 --> 17:31.550
Just me and my five dogs.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.201
Wait, I thought
you only had three dogs.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.420
I just adopted two
online right now.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.672
Oh, this pit bull hates kids.

17:36.673 --> 17:37.839
That's fine;
I'll never have any.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.840
Add to cart.

17:38.841 --> 17:42.761
Okay, let me just grab that.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.045
Listen to me, Charles.

17:44.046 --> 17:45.046
You're gonna be fine.

17:45.047 --> 17:46.682
There are plenty
of women out there.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.984
Strong, beautiful, smart women.

17:48.985 --> 17:49.985
How about her?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.486
She's very beautiful.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.555
With my luck,
she's probably a car thief.

17:53.556 --> 17:54.556
Don't be ridiculous.

17:54.557 --> 17:56.057
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

17:56.058 --> 17:57.159
Who's the babe?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.361
Just booked her
for elder abuse.

17:59.362 --> 18:00.445
Elder abuse, that's nice.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.563
All right, fine.

18:01.564 --> 18:03.081
We shouldn't be
doing this at a precinct.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.117
I really thought I was gonna
get Genevieve out of prison.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.535
Then we'd cover
ourselves in paint

18:06.536 --> 18:09.538
and make love for 25 hours,
one more hour than her and Nick.

18:09.539 --> 18:10.589
Boyle, you would hate that.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.574
Your little hummingbird heart
would explode.

18:12.575 --> 18:14.960
I wish I didn't have a heart.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.962
I'm off to the cheese shop...

18:18.181 --> 18:20.766
And I'm buying by the wheel.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.601
The cheese wheel.
Yeah, I got it.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.102
Gina, as you predicted,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.605
there was some backlash
to the poster campaign.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.942
Yes, I'm the nostradamus
of your shame.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.443
I think a problem
the police have had

18:31.444 --> 18:34.229
is our inability
to admit our mistakes,

18:34.230 --> 18:37.282
so this campaign

18:37.283 --> 18:40.702
was, um...

18:40.703 --> 18:41.703
A mistake.

18:41.704 --> 18:42.904
You told me that,

18:42.905 --> 18:44.206
but I got defensive
and didn't listen.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.107
I should have been
open to criticism,

18:46.108 --> 18:49.277
as this department should be
open to criticism.

18:49.278 --> 18:53.281
That's why I'm
replacing these with...

18:56.619 --> 18:59.421
These.

18:59.422 --> 19:00.789
My email address
is at the bottom,

19:00.790 --> 19:03.508
and I intend to respond
to every message I receive.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.061
Before we put them up,
I want to hear your thoughts.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.562
I love them.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.299
Once again, my advice has,
like, saved the city.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.467
I came up with the slogan.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.969
It's tacky to
take credit for stuff.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.306
We're here to apologize.

19:18.307 --> 19:19.825
I can't prove you took
my moose tracks,

19:19.826 --> 19:20.975
so I shouldn't have
yelled at you.

19:20.976 --> 19:22.143
I'm impressed.

19:22.144 --> 19:23.662
It takes a big person to admit

19:23.663 --> 19:25.247
when they're being
a total dum-dum.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.748
We want to make it up to you.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.949
We got you a pizza.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.952
Only one pizza for both of us?

19:30.953 --> 19:32.587
Oh, my God.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.257
That was an obvious
setup, you morons.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.792
You're eating cheese.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.927
You're lying about
being lactose intolerant.

19:38.928 --> 19:39.928
No, we weren't.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.263
Some things are
just delicious enough

19:41.264 --> 19:42.798
to suffer the consequences.

19:42.799 --> 19:44.766
I'm diabetic, but I still
eat sugar out of the bag.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.801
Both: Ugh!

19:45.802 --> 19:48.136
Just admit you took
my moose tracks.

19:48.137 --> 19:49.805
Admit it!

19:49.806 --> 19:51.556
Admit...

19:51.557 --> 19:53.141
It.

19:53.142 --> 19:54.810
Yeah, we ate it.

19:54.811 --> 19:57.145
And we're eating your pizza.

19:57.146 --> 20:01.483
So who's the moron now?

20:01.484 --> 20:03.285
Ooh, stomach.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.286
Oh, yeah.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.739
It's coming.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.740
They admitted it.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.659
That's a victory, right?

20:10.660 --> 20:12.327
No, Terry.

20:12.328 --> 20:13.378
There are no winners here.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.379
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.380
Coming through, coming through!

20:15.381 --> 20:16.498
Move it!

20:16.499 --> 20:18.166
Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

20:20.837 --> 20:22.671
Getting in a little late there
this morning, boyle.

20:22.672 --> 20:23.672
Where you been?

20:23.673 --> 20:24.706
Cursing out my own shadow

20:24.707 --> 20:27.208
for hanging out
with a loser like me.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.543
Also an eye doctor appointment.

20:28.544 --> 20:29.878
Well, there's something
in the holding cell

20:29.879 --> 20:32.981
that might cheer you up.

20:32.982 --> 20:33.982
That's Nick's assistant.

20:33.983 --> 20:34.983
Why is she here?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.151
After you left last night,

20:36.152 --> 20:37.986
I was thinking about
the 24-hour sex painting,

20:37.987 --> 20:40.188
"Genevieve 416."

20:40.189 --> 20:41.523
Check out the date
on this receipt

20:41.524 --> 20:43.942
from the storage locker
with the stolen art.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.026
April 16th.

20:45.027 --> 20:46.728
416!
Exactly.

20:46.729 --> 20:47.746
She couldn't have rented it,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.064
because she was busy
getting busy.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.065
Oh, good one.

20:51.066 --> 20:52.284
This is fantastic.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.335
I mean, I'm not happy

20:53.336 --> 20:54.786
that she was having sex
with another man,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.371
but I'm okay with it
if that's what gets her off.

20:56.372 --> 20:57.672
Do you seriously not hear it,

20:57.673 --> 20:59.057
because it almost seems
intentional at this point.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.309
Why would dvora
set Genevieve up?

21:01.310 --> 21:02.744
Because she's
in love with Nick.

21:02.745 --> 21:05.213
She used one of those
latex casts of Genevieve's hand

21:05.214 --> 21:06.214
to get the fingerprints

21:06.215 --> 21:07.432
so she could
break into the gallery.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.267
Wow, I can't believe
you kept working the case

21:09.268 --> 21:10.936
even after I gave up.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.104
That was a nice thing to do.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.157
Charles, I didn't
do it to be nice.

21:15.158 --> 21:17.242
I did it to be amazing.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.443
And I think you're
a great detective,

21:18.444 --> 21:19.795
and I trusted your gut.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.246
Go get your girlfriend
out of prison.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.747
Oh, thanks, man.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.800
Next time you see me,
I'm gonna be all out of orgasms.

21:24.801 --> 21:26.935
No, you can't say that
while you're hugging someone.

21:29.272 --> 21:30.272
