WEBVTT

00:01.331 --> 00:03.298
Would you look at all
these credit card charges?

00:03.299 --> 00:05.534
I thought we agreed to
cut down on our spending.

00:05.535 --> 00:06.835
I didn't agree.

00:06.836 --> 00:11.340
I said I thought
it was a good idea, okay?

00:11.341 --> 00:13.775
And I still do.

00:13.776 --> 00:16.411
Why do you need to
buy all this stuff?

00:16.412 --> 00:18.814
It's Christmas.
Don't be such a Scrooge.

00:18.815 --> 00:22.317
Well, since when is it my job to
make sure everybody has a gift?

00:22.318 --> 00:25.620
Carl, let's go!
Shake a leg!

00:28.925 --> 00:30.692
Yeah.

00:30.693 --> 00:32.728
We'll just get some
coffee for the road.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.329
Traffic's gonna
be a bitch.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.864
Should we take the Eisenhower?

00:35.865 --> 00:37.766
Uh, you know, I was
thinking surface streets.

00:37.767 --> 00:38.834
Yeah, that's a good plan.

00:38.835 --> 00:40.501
One drop of snow,
people start driving

00:40.503 --> 00:42.404
like idiots.

00:42.405 --> 00:43.939
Okay, fellas, dinner's at 6:00.

00:43.940 --> 00:46.575
Don't be late.
Ham waits for no one.

00:46.576 --> 00:48.644
You got it, my dear.

00:48.645 --> 00:50.545
All right, let's hit it.

00:50.546 --> 00:51.747
You look a little skinny
from behind there.

00:51.748 --> 00:54.215
You lost some weight?
Eh, I'm trying.

01:29.835 --> 01:31.503
What is it with this song?

01:31.504 --> 01:33.371
Feels like it's on
a constant loop.

01:33.372 --> 01:36.341
'Cause it is.
It's Molly's favorite.

01:36.342 --> 01:39.778
Which means it's all
of our favorites.

01:39.779 --> 01:42.313
Well, at a certain point,
it's no longer festive.

01:42.314 --> 01:44.249
It's-it's psychological torture.

01:46.218 --> 01:48.653
I'd turn it back on
before Molly decks your balls

01:48.654 --> 01:50.821
and roasts your chestnuts.

01:51.957 --> 01:54.893
How come it's always
about what she wants?

01:54.894 --> 01:57.195
Well... I like Christmas, too.

01:57.196 --> 01:59.330
Oh, is this about cooking
your stupid seven fish?

01:59.331 --> 02:00.932
Well, not just that.

02:00.933 --> 02:02.167
But what harm would it do?

02:02.168 --> 02:04.935
It would make the house stink
like seven fish.

02:04.937 --> 02:08.672
And that, to me,
is what Christmas smells like.

02:10.209 --> 02:12.177
Hey...

02:12.178 --> 02:14.079
Not that I'm angry, but, uh,

02:14.080 --> 02:17.781
who bought
the wrong popcorn balls, huh?

02:21.687 --> 02:23.154
Was that...?

02:23.155 --> 02:24.956
They were out of the
ones you usually get.

02:24.957 --> 02:26.024
Oh.

02:26.025 --> 02:27.225
And you looked everywhere?

02:27.226 --> 02:29.858
No, ma'am.

02:30.863 --> 02:32.163
That's okay.

02:32.164 --> 02:34.399
That's okay.
You know who's gonna love 'em?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.267
The birds.

02:36.268 --> 02:39.037
'Cause they don't
care that they're ugly.

02:39.038 --> 02:41.406
Oh...

02:41.407 --> 02:42.807
Oh, how are the cookies?

02:42.808 --> 02:44.108
They're coming along nicely.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.443
Oh...
What do you think?

02:45.444 --> 02:46.544

02:46.545 --> 02:49.047

for a gingerbread man.

02:49.048 --> 02:51.349
Hmm.  Ah.

02:51.350 --> 02:53.451
Three seemed
like overkill.

02:53.452 --> 02:55.587
Oh, we must have been
overkilling it

02:55.588 --> 02:57.188
for the last 30 years.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.999
Oh, look at that.

Oh! This... This, yes...
This, this, this.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.505

03:13.506 --> 03:15.273
That just feels better, right?

03:15.274 --> 03:16.908
Yeah.
Am I right?

03:16.909 --> 03:19.343
Oh, good job. Hey...

Okay, let's pick
it up, Jingles.

04:15.668 --> 04:17.569
We got a long line
of wonderful children

04:17.570 --> 04:18.837
and a ham waiting at home.

04:18.838 --> 04:20.505
You got it, Santa.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.808
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

04:23.809 --> 04:25.510
And who do we have here?

04:25.511 --> 04:26.878
Well, this is Katie, Santa.

04:26.879 --> 04:28.847
She's in Girl Scouts,
she likes unicorns,

04:28.848 --> 04:30.882
her favorite food
is banana pancakes.

04:30.883 --> 04:32.717
She's got a Chihuahua dog
named Nacho,

04:32.718 --> 04:35.887
and she's allergic to soy
and, apparently, walnuts.

04:35.888 --> 04:37.889
Just need the name, Jingles,

04:37.890 --> 04:40.024
not her complete
medical history.

04:40.025 --> 04:43.294
So, Katie, have you been
a good girl this year?

04:43.295 --> 04:44.762
Yes.

04:44.763 --> 04:46.698
Well, why don't you
whisper in Santa's ear

04:46.699 --> 04:48.666
and tell me what you
want for Christmas,

04:48.667 --> 04:51.336
while Jingles gets
you a nice gift?

04:51.337 --> 04:53.071
So many to choose from.

04:54.173 --> 04:56.708
Is this the perfect one
for Katie?

04:56.709 --> 04:59.344
No.

04:59.345 --> 05:02.046
Is this the perfect one
for Katie?

05:02.047 --> 05:03.614
No.

05:04.984 --> 05:07.252
Is this the perfect one
for Katie?

05:07.253 --> 05:08.685
Pick one!

05:09.555 --> 05:12.523
All right, Katie, here you go.

05:12.524 --> 05:13.858
The perfect gift.

05:13.859 --> 05:15.894
Ho, ho, ho.
How about that?

05:15.895 --> 05:17.161
Thank you, Santa.

05:17.162 --> 05:18.696
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

05:18.697 --> 05:20.665
Jingles, a-a-a word.

05:21.667 --> 05:22.934
Ho, ho, ho!

05:24.770 --> 05:25.937
What the hell are you doing?

05:25.938 --> 05:27.605
We should have been done
an hour ago.

05:27.606 --> 05:30.108
Well, I can't help it if there's
a bigger turnout this year.

05:30.109 --> 05:31.309
For the under-eight crowd,

05:31.310 --> 05:33.311
your lap is the place
to be and be seen.

05:33.312 --> 05:35.313
Yeah, well, I'd like
to be seen before New Year's.

05:35.314 --> 05:36.514
Can we pick up
the pace, please?

05:36.515 --> 05:38.216
All right, you got it.
Thank you. Thank you.

05:38.217 --> 05:40.885
All right, kids.
Ho, ho. Ho, ho.

05:40.886 --> 05:43.688
All right, kids, we got
to speed it up a little.

05:43.689 --> 05:45.123
Santa's got things
to do tonight.

05:45.124 --> 05:48.026
We've got his reindeer
all gassed up and ready to fly.

Skee-Ball tickets to get it?

06:43.949 --> 06:46.417

only cost me $49

Oh, well, okay.

07:08.907 --> 07:13.478
I am never running an errand
on Christmas Eve again.

07:13.479 --> 07:17.749
It's like a holly-jolly
end of days out there.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.218
It wasn't a total loss, though.

07:20.219 --> 07:23.254
I found my first contribution

07:23.255 --> 07:25.590
to the Flynn family
Christmas tree.

07:25.591 --> 07:27.492
Santa in the outhouse.

07:27.493 --> 07:29.260
Aw...!

07:29.261 --> 07:32.363
Aw, look at him
sitting on the pot.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.198
That is adorable.

07:34.199 --> 07:36.667
It really humanizes him,
doesn't it?

07:36.668 --> 07:38.669
Wait. Best part.

07:39.972 --> 07:42.440
Ho, ho... Whoa!

07:42.441 --> 07:44.809
Where should I hang it?

07:44.810 --> 07:48.246
No, no, no. You're not hanging
a toilet on my tree.

07:48.247 --> 07:50.681
Oh, I forgot.<i> Your</i> tree,
the way <i> you</i> want it.

07:50.682 --> 07:53.084
What about the rest of us?
Don't we get a say?

07:53.085 --> 07:55.119
I don't see anybody
else complaining.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.320
'Cause they're too scared.

07:56.321 --> 07:57.822
Oh, really?

07:57.823 --> 07:59.891
We are a little scared of you.

07:59.892 --> 08:04.195
Well, how... how... how am
I possibly a scary person?

08:04.196 --> 08:06.164
Christmas lives
in my soul.

08:06.165 --> 08:08.599
It'll slide

08:08.600 --> 08:11.701
- right in here next to the clay cactus.
- No, don't touch...

08:12.571 --> 08:14.005
Oh, no.

08:14.006 --> 08:15.706
What have you done?

08:15.707 --> 08:17.608
I-I'm... I'm sorry.
I-I...

08:17.609 --> 08:19.142
Don't touch it!

08:26.485 --> 08:29.286
It was an accident.
I'll get her a new one.

08:29.288 --> 08:31.255
You can't replace that one.

08:31.256 --> 08:33.390
She made it with her dad.

08:33.392 --> 08:34.759
Ah, geez.

08:37.029 --> 08:39.629
Now that's a Yule log.

08:45.037 --> 08:48.339
Ah... there you are.

08:52.411 --> 08:54.278
What are you doing?

08:54.279 --> 08:56.514
Oh, that breeze is blowing
right up my elf skirt.

08:56.515 --> 08:59.317
Jack Frost is nipping at
a whole lot more than my nose.

08:59.318 --> 09:01.752
Why couldn't Ramirez
load the truck?

09:01.753 --> 09:04.188
Well, he was gonna, but
I sent him home to his family.

09:04.189 --> 09:06.290
What about my family?
I got one, too.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.658
Well, in the spirit
of the season,

09:07.659 --> 09:08.759
I didn't think about you.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.928
Yeah, you never seem to.
You do this every year.

09:10.929 --> 09:13.264
You volunteer me for all this
stuff without even asking.

09:13.265 --> 09:14.799
You love being Santa.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.068
This isn't being Santa.
This is being the UPS guy.

09:17.069 --> 09:19.971
I should have switched
to a brown outfit.

09:19.972 --> 09:21.572
You don't think
Santa loaded his sleigh?

09:21.573 --> 09:23.774
No, he doesn't.
That's why he owns elves.

09:23.775 --> 09:26.410
Owns elves?! What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

09:28.413 --> 09:31.047
What was that?

09:32.351 --> 09:33.551
Probably some kids
screwing around.

09:33.552 --> 09:35.820
Hey, you kids,
I know you're having fun,

09:35.821 --> 09:37.889
but Santa's still back here!

09:39.825 --> 09:41.125
Are you kidding me?

09:41.126 --> 09:42.926
Our truck's getting jacked!

09:45.531 --> 09:47.098
Ow!

09:47.099 --> 09:49.033
Oh, quit using
that elf voice!

09:49.034 --> 09:51.434
I'm not. I feel on a Rubik's Cube!
Aah!

10:01.511 --> 10:05.249
Okay, okay. I've been tracking
our driving pattern in my head.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.185
We've taken one left turn,
two rights,

10:08.186 --> 10:10.454
and I think we passed
a sewage plant

10:10.455 --> 10:12.890
or you passed a sewage plant.

10:12.891 --> 10:14.925
Just give me your phone
so I can call this in.

10:14.926 --> 10:16.994
Mine's back
at the community center.

10:16.995 --> 10:19.363
Look at me... tell me where
I got room for a phone.

10:19.364 --> 10:20.998
No phones, no guns, no badges.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.967
What are we gonna do
when those guys open that door?

10:22.968 --> 10:25.335
All right, let's just see where
we are in terms of weapons.

10:26.171 --> 10:29.040
Okay, all right,
we got some Hulk fists.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.608
Ah. Ah.

10:30.609 --> 10:33.643
Some Nerf nunchucks.

10:34.846 --> 10:36.947
Boom. Etch A Sketch.

10:36.948 --> 10:38.015
Great. If we get a peek at 'em,

10:38.016 --> 10:40.851
you'll be able to knob out
a composite.

10:40.852 --> 10:42.753
Hey, I'm just taking inventory
of our resources.

10:42.754 --> 10:44.855
Pardon me
if my training kicks in.

10:44.856 --> 10:47.158
They don't know
that we're unarmed.

10:47.159 --> 10:48.893
So I say we identify ourselves

10:48.894 --> 10:50.628
and tell 'em backup's
on the way.

10:50.629 --> 10:52.396
Okay.

10:53.699 --> 10:56.534
Pull over! Pull over right now!
Chicago PD!

10:59.408 --> 11:01.505
Okay. Just be cool.
Follow my lead.

11:01.506 --> 11:03.074
Is somebody back there?

11:03.075 --> 11:05.342
Chicago PD!
You are under arrest!

11:05.343 --> 11:07.078
Open this back door,
lay on the ground,

11:07.079 --> 11:09.180
put your hands
behind your head!

11:09.181 --> 11:13.117
Yeah, I don't think so.

11:13.118 --> 11:15.486
You don't want to make this
any worse than it already is!

11:15.487 --> 11:18.221
Yeah, 'cause you're looking
at grand theft, kidnapping,

11:18.223 --> 11:21.358
and-and not coming
to a full stop at a stop sign.

11:21.359 --> 11:23.661
You think I didn't feel that?!

11:23.662 --> 11:25.629
You guys are really
scaring us back there,

11:25.630 --> 11:29.166
all locked up and not being
able to do anything about it.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.935
Instead of dealing
with all this,

11:30.936 --> 11:33.170
maybe we should just drive
the truck into the lake.

11:33.171 --> 11:35.206
They make good points.

11:35.207 --> 11:37.408
Believe me, you don't
want to do that!

11:37.409 --> 11:38.409
Why not?

11:38.410 --> 11:40.711
Because...

11:40.712 --> 11:45.149
I will be very
disappointed in you!

11:45.150 --> 11:47.351
I'm warning you guys,
this is your last chance!

11:47.352 --> 11:50.554
Let us out of here now!

11:50.555 --> 11:52.756
Hello?

11:54.392 --> 11:56.327
I think they left us
in here, Carl.

11:56.328 --> 11:59.730
Look, I'm not saying
this is your fault, but...

11:59.731 --> 12:02.599
you are a horrible negotiator.

12:08.673 --> 12:10.574
How's the patient?

12:10.575 --> 12:12.276
Oh, doesn't look good.

12:12.277 --> 12:13.477
Aw, honey.

12:13.478 --> 12:15.479
It never did.

12:15.480 --> 12:19.150
Maybe 'cause I was six
when I made it.

12:19.151 --> 12:22.419
I never understood,
why a cactus?

12:22.420 --> 12:23.788
No...

12:23.789 --> 12:25.623
It was supposed to be...

12:25.624 --> 12:27.224
me and Dad's stockings.

12:27.225 --> 12:30.327
But we put them
too close together in the oven,

12:30.328 --> 12:33.931
and hence,
the Christmas cactus was born.

12:33.932 --> 12:38.302
That man
loved Christmas.

12:38.303 --> 12:42.506
I know that's why you get
so nuts this time of year.

12:42.507 --> 12:46.577
That's also why
we put up with it.

12:46.578 --> 12:49.914
I guess I just think if we...

12:49.915 --> 12:53.417
keep doing things the way
we always have, it's...

12:53.418 --> 12:56.453
kind of like he's still here.

12:56.454 --> 12:59.856
He is.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.435
You know,
Vince thinks you hate him.

13:13.271 --> 13:16.272
Yeah?

13:17.142 --> 13:19.577
Molly.

13:20.912 --> 13:22.980
Let me feel my feelings.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.048
All right.

13:24.049 --> 13:25.682
But when you're done
doing that,

13:25.684 --> 13:28.319
you go apologize.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.287
Okay, but...

13:30.288 --> 13:32.957
that's his present.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.358
That's fine.

13:34.359 --> 13:36.526
I don't think
he got you anything either.

13:39.865 --> 13:42.032
Hello?! Anybody!

13:42.033 --> 13:44.435
Chicago PD! Open up!

13:44.436 --> 13:46.170
Why do you keep telling
people we're cops?

13:46.171 --> 13:48.105
I thought you wanted someone
to come help us.

13:48.106 --> 13:49.139
Agh...

13:49.140 --> 13:51.342
Here we go.

13:51.343 --> 13:54.078

Yeah, the year before
my mom left me with my grandma,

14:44.062 --> 14:46.196
we spent Christmas
in a shelter.

14:46.197 --> 14:50.935
The police toy drive, man,
they put a GI Joe in my hand.

14:50.936 --> 14:53.170
We've been
doing this for eight years.

ashamed of it, either.

Hello, children.

Do any of you have
a cell phone?

15:32.143 --> 15:35.346
No. That's what
I asked you for.

15:35.347 --> 15:37.648
Sorry, kids,
we can't talk right now.

15:44.255 --> 15:46.390
Sorry, Santa, but, uh,

15:46.391 --> 15:48.058
thought you needed
to get a move on.

15:48.059 --> 15:49.660
Don't be silly.

15:49.661 --> 15:51.362
Now, I'll hand
out these toys

Vince?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.387
Yes?

16:18.590 --> 16:19.690
I don't hate you.

16:19.691 --> 16:21.859
All right, have a good
Christmas.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.060
I'm so sorry!

16:26.865 --> 16:28.331
I drop everything...
plates, lightbulbs,

16:28.333 --> 16:31.068
my nephew on his baptism.

16:31.069 --> 16:32.569
Seriously?

16:32.570 --> 16:33.704
Right into the holy water.

16:33.705 --> 16:36.340
He was gonna go in, anyway,
but still...

16:36.341 --> 16:40.744
Listen, I-I know I hold on to
these traditions kind of tight.

16:40.745 --> 16:42.012
Like an anaconda.

16:42.013 --> 16:43.313
But...

16:43.314 --> 16:46.316
I get it... you do a beautiful
Christmas every year.

16:46.317 --> 16:47.885
Thank you.

16:47.886 --> 16:49.386
I-It's just that,

16:49.387 --> 16:51.355
yeah, I've been around

16:51.356 --> 16:54.658
for three Christmases now.

16:54.659 --> 16:57.895
I'm not trying
to replace anybody.

16:57.896 --> 16:59.729
I just...

17:01.533 --> 17:05.101
I don't want to feel like
a visitor anymore.

17:07.704 --> 17:10.773
Look, I-I'm sorry I haven't
been the most welcoming.

17:10.775 --> 17:12.242
You don't got
to apologize.

17:12.242 --> 17:13.676
Believe it or not,
I've found

17:13.678 --> 17:16.780
it takes people a while
to warm up to me.

17:16.781 --> 17:19.750
No... no...

17:19.751 --> 17:21.819
I just want you to know
I love your mom,

17:21.819 --> 17:24.454
and I think the world
of you girls.

17:27.157 --> 17:28.992
Well...

17:28.993 --> 17:30.227
you know, we're gonna have

17:30.228 --> 17:32.830
a lot of Christmases
ahead of us, so...

17:32.831 --> 17:35.299
maybe it's time
we officially make you part

17:35.300 --> 17:37.868
of the Flynn family tradition.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.136
Really?

17:39.137 --> 17:40.270
On the tree?

17:40.271 --> 17:42.239
Yep.
Where you can see it?

17:42.240 --> 17:44.174
Okay, I'm not making
any promises.

17:44.175 --> 17:47.377
There's a, there's a flow
to that tree.

17:47.378 --> 17:49.813
You've made me a very happy man.

17:49.814 --> 17:52.515
Oh, let's save it
for next Christmas.

17:52.517 --> 17:55.074
Damn it, I can't wait that long!
Come here.

18:11.232 --> 18:16.102

18:16.103 --> 18:19.172
Okay, the Christmas ham
is finally served.

18:19.173 --> 18:22.808
What took you guys so long?

18:22.810 --> 18:24.911
Well, there were
a lot of kids this year.

18:24.912 --> 18:26.546
A lot more than expected.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.014
Mm-hmm, and this man
wouldn't leave

18:28.015 --> 18:29.916
until every last
one of them had a toy.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.182
Did you see Vince's ornament?

18:33.183 --> 18:34.473
Front and center.

18:34.474 --> 18:37.112
It's Santa on the dumper.

18:37.113 --> 18:38.770
But don't press the button
while Molly's in the room.

18:38.771 --> 18:40.854
She doesn't think it's as funny
as the rest of the world.

18:41.912 --> 18:46.710
I'm sorry, I just think that
Santa deserves some privacy.

18:46.711 --> 18:49.348
Hey, uh, does this mean
that I can get an ornament?

18:49.349 --> 18:50.624
No, that tree is perfect now.

18:50.625 --> 18:52.368
Why would you want
to add anything?

18:52.369 --> 18:53.517
It's got a nice flow.

18:54.793 --> 18:57.174
You know, while we're on
the topic of changing stuff,

18:57.175 --> 18:59.598
haven't you people ever heard
of Elf on the Shelf?

18:59.599 --> 19:02.490
No, the elfin folk are poorly
represented in this house.

19:03.416 --> 19:04.688
They creep me out.

19:04.689 --> 19:06.644
Okay, don't want
to ruffle any feathers,

19:06.645 --> 19:09.110
seeing how this is my first
Christmas as a family member.

19:09.111 --> 19:11.545
Hey, you been dating Victoria
for four months.

19:11.546 --> 19:14.030
It took me three years
to get one lousy ornament.

19:14.031 --> 19:15.883
Yeah, you got to do your time,
like we did.

19:15.884 --> 19:17.457
Besides, nobody's getting
anything else

19:17.458 --> 19:19.583
until I get my
Midnight Mass pancakes.

19:19.584 --> 19:20.965
You don't go to Mass.

19:20.966 --> 19:23.389
Which is why we can have
the pancakes at 9:00.

19:23.390 --> 19:25.475
See, you can't just come in here
and start deciding.

19:25.476 --> 19:27.531
