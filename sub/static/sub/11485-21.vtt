WEBVTT

00:02.318 --> 00:05.287
These divorce lawyers have
a good business, don't they?

00:05.488 --> 00:09.584
Yeah, in the same way
locusts have a good business.

00:13.163 --> 00:15.961
Smells good. So does the coffee.

00:17.967 --> 00:21.733
Charlie, stop sniffing the paralegals.

00:21.905 --> 00:24.135
Look,
I am paying my attorney by the hour,

00:24.240 --> 00:25.764
so just speak when spoken to

00:25.842 --> 00:29.835
and otherwise, you know, just shut up.

00:30.747 --> 00:34.308
If you'd listened to me in the first place,
you wouldn't be in this mess.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.317
I'm the one who told you not to marry her.

00:36.419 --> 00:39.752
You're also the one who told me
that if I jumped off the garage roof

00:39.823 --> 00:43.782
with a bath towel tied around my neck,
I could fly to school.

00:44.861 --> 00:46.419
The one time you listened to me.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.594
Let me tell you another thing.
If I hadn't married Judith,

00:49.666 --> 00:50.792
there'd be no Jake.

00:50.934 --> 00:53.368
I didn't say you couldn't knock her up.

00:54.170 --> 00:55.865
Okay, let's get started.

00:56.606 --> 00:58.631
- Wow!
- No.

00:58.708 --> 01:02.701
No wowing. No sniffing, no wowing.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.939
- Laura Lang.
- Charlie Harper.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.482
- Didn't you used to date Superman?
- That's Lana Lang.

01:09.552 --> 01:11.315
She was Superboy's girlfriend.

01:11.387 --> 01:14.686
And guys have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

01:14.791 --> 01:15.985
Did it ever work?

01:16.659 --> 01:19.389
- Let's just get down to business, okay?
- Okay.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.392
Didn't the Titanic bang into her?

01:24.134 --> 01:26.694
Okay, Mr. Harper,
the reason I wanted to see you is

01:26.803 --> 01:29.203
because your brother is involved
in a divorce action

01:29.305 --> 01:31.705
where the custody of his son
might become an issue.

01:31.808 --> 01:33.207
Really? Why?

01:33.309 --> 01:35.971
Because Jake stays
with his father part-time,

01:36.045 --> 01:38.980
his father lives with you,
and in the words of his mother,

01:39.048 --> 01:41.380
you are, hang on, I want to get this right.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.713
Here it is, "A sleaze ball. "

01:45.321 --> 01:46.948
Yeah. So?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.848
So she might try to take Jake
out of your home.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.025
Why? It's a beautiful home.

01:52.996 --> 01:54.987
You should really come see it
some evening.

01:58.701 --> 02:02.137
It's in Malibu. Right on the beach.

02:03.973 --> 02:07.841
My point is, if Mrs. Harper decides
to make an issue out of your lifestyle

02:07.911 --> 02:09.139
we need to be prepared.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.543
What's wrong with my lifestyle?

02:10.646 --> 02:14.174
No, we are not going down that road
at $300 an hour.

02:14.417 --> 02:15.714
Relax, Alan.

02:15.819 --> 02:19.311
I'm going to need to know every possible
thing they can use against us.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.085
- Every skeleton in your closet.
- Oh, boy.

02:23.860 --> 02:26.226
So what,
you want to know about my sex life?

02:26.429 --> 02:29.728
Your sex life, your drinking,
your gambling, partying.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.759
On the beach.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.097
Mr. Harper.

02:36.372 --> 02:39.273
I'm sorry. But isn't that kind
of an invasion of my privacy?

02:39.375 --> 02:41.070
It is, and I apologize for that.

02:41.544 --> 02:45.844
But I handle a lot of divorces,
and believe me, they can get nasty.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.844
Look, I've got to be in court.
So why don't you give this some thought,

02:49.919 --> 02:53.753
and when you gather
the information we need, give me a call.

02:57.460 --> 03:00.623
Okay. Starting from now
and working backward,

03:01.564 --> 03:05.227
I've slept with my brother's attorney...

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.779 --> 03:19.407
So, Laura, let me ask you something.

03:20.083 --> 03:24.076
The other day in your office,
you didn't seem to like me much.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.814
I was just wondering what caused you to
drive over here, you know, mostly naked?

03:30.159 --> 03:32.923
Charlie,
I don't have to like you to want you.

03:33.496 --> 03:34.758
Right on.

03:39.402 --> 03:41.666
For the record,
I don't like you much either.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.733
Right on.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.404
Another question.

03:51.014 --> 03:53.676
Seeing as how you're my brother's lawyer
and all,

03:53.783 --> 03:56.946
is what we're doing here,
what's the word, unethical?

03:57.153 --> 03:58.643
Oh, God, yes.

03:59.522 --> 04:00.614
Right on.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.925
Listen, Charlie.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.827
I totally get who you are.
You date lots of women, you're a player.

04:08.031 --> 04:11.523
- That's fine. I don't care.
- You are very special.

04:12.702 --> 04:15.170
I just have one little request.

04:15.271 --> 04:17.762
You can pretty much
have anything you want right now.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.207
If your brother found out about us,
he could sue me for malpractice.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.676
I'm taking a big risk here.

04:22.779 --> 04:27.842
- Man, this just keeps getting hotter.
- But I need you to do something for me.

04:28.384 --> 04:32.480
When I call you, when I want you,
you've got to be there.

04:32.722 --> 04:37.250
Okay. Let's practice. Hello?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.162
- Hey, Laura. What's up?
- Now.

04:40.463 --> 04:41.794
Right on.

04:47.937 --> 04:51.464
- Hello? Charlie?
- No.

04:53.142 --> 04:56.168
Sorry,
but I'm gonna have to speed this up.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.844
Charlie, relax.

04:58.982 --> 05:02.042
Just go downstairs
and distract him while I sneak out.

05:02.318 --> 05:04.718
- You're going to leave?
- I'm done.

05:05.288 --> 05:07.449
No cuddling, no sharing feelings?

05:08.324 --> 05:11.885
- I think I'm starting to like you.
- Save the sweet talk.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.526
Just remember our deal.

05:13.696 --> 05:15.664
You know, it suddenly occurs to me,

05:16.199 --> 05:18.827
I'm usually the one sneaking out
when the man gets home.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.664
Charlie, go.

05:20.803 --> 05:22.532
I thought it was a fun fact.

05:26.209 --> 05:28.006
- Hi, Uncle Charlie.
- Hey, buddy.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.739
- You're here early.
- Teacher's conference, half day.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.238
- Where you going?
- Looking for my Gameboy.

05:33.549 --> 05:37.315
Forget your Gameboy.
It's a beautiful day. Go watch TV.

05:38.221 --> 05:41.918
I don't want to watch TV. I want to play
my Gameboy, and it's in your room.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.018
The parental code that unlocks
the pay channels is one-two-three-four.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.691
One-two-three-four. I should have known.

05:53.403 --> 05:55.871
I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt your late-morning nap,

05:55.938 --> 05:57.565
or your early-afternoon nap?

05:57.673 --> 05:59.732
I don't nap. I recharge.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.411
- Can I get you a beer?
- Sure, thanks.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.172
Come on.

06:06.516 --> 06:09.110
Hang on.
Alan Harper for Laura Lang, please.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.209
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling my lawyer.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.255
Why?
I thought we were going to have a beer.

06:13.356 --> 06:15.551
Judith is demanding half
of my book collection.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.683
Oh, man.

06:16.759 --> 06:20.593
- Sounds like you need a beer.
- They are rare first editions, Charlie.

06:20.696 --> 06:21.754
Very valuable.

06:21.864 --> 06:24.196
Okay, you don't need
to get your lawyer involved.

06:24.267 --> 06:26.599
You still got your old garage door clicker,
right?

06:26.702 --> 06:28.863
- Yeah.
- So let Judith have the books.

06:28.938 --> 06:32.271
Then one night,
maybe someone goes and gets them back.

06:32.608 --> 06:34.439
Wonderful. Breaking and entering.

06:34.544 --> 06:38.878
- It's not breaking if you have the clicker.
- More good advice.

06:39.248 --> 06:40.408
And it's free.

06:41.117 --> 06:44.382
- So hang up, and let's get that beer.
- Sure, I'll hold.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.316
Yeah, they're patching me through
to her cell phone.

06:49.725 --> 06:50.749
What's that?

06:51.127 --> 06:54.961
That is coincidentally my cell phone.

06:56.632 --> 06:59.066
- Excuse me.
- Hi, Alan.

06:59.735 --> 07:02.966
- Don't answer.
- What's up?

07:03.406 --> 07:05.636
- What are you doing?
- Hang on, Alan.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.773
I'm making a living, Charlie.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.303
I thought you were worried
about malpractice.

07:10.413 --> 07:12.540
I'm more worried about billable hours.

07:13.449 --> 07:17.044
Can you prove you acquired the books
in question prior to the marriage?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.951
- Charlie?
- Coming!

07:20.056 --> 07:24.083
- Why are you shushing me? Hang on.
- What?

07:24.160 --> 07:26.560
- I'm on the phone with Laura.
- Say hi for me.

07:27.163 --> 07:30.894
- Give it up, Charlie. She doesn't like you.
- True.

07:31.567 --> 07:35.765
You'll testify that I bought all my first
edition books before I got married, right?

07:35.838 --> 07:36.930
- Did you?
- No.

07:37.006 --> 07:40.169
- Then I'm your man.
- I can prove it. Charlie's my witness.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.170
- What happened to the TV?
- There's nothing dirty on.

07:44.647 --> 07:47.138
- I'm going to go play my Gameboy.
- No.

07:47.350 --> 07:50.080
Wait right here. I'll get it for you.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.520
Of course he's credible.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.149
I don't know, Alan.

07:54.257 --> 07:59.320
If the right lawyer gets their hands on him,
they could really make him sweat.

08:01.531 --> 08:03.021
Yeah, very funny.

08:03.132 --> 08:05.623
Have you seen a Gameboy
anywhere around here?

08:05.701 --> 08:07.760
Okay,
we'll just have to do the best we can.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.998
I'll tell him exactly what to do
and who knows,

08:11.140 --> 08:13.005
maybe he'll get the job done.

08:15.511 --> 08:17.206
I got the job done twice.

08:19.182 --> 08:21.047
Why don't you let me talk to him?

08:21.317 --> 08:22.648
Charlie?

08:26.155 --> 08:27.520
Why?

08:33.996 --> 08:36.988
- Where's my Gameboy?
- I'll buy you a new one.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.664
She wants to talk to you. Keep it short.

08:41.003 --> 08:44.530
Alan, if I could keep it short,
my life would be so much simpler.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.032
- Hello?
- Now.

08:47.543 --> 08:48.737
What?

08:50.179 --> 08:52.704
I want you now.

08:53.883 --> 08:55.316
You've gotta be kidding.

08:55.384 --> 08:59.377
Charlie, I'm paying her by the hour.
Just listen to her and do what she says.

09:00.690 --> 09:03.386
You're the boss. I'll get right on it.

09:04.694 --> 09:06.161
What did she say?

09:06.729 --> 09:08.720
She wants me to write a statement.

09:08.864 --> 09:11.833
And she wants you to take Jake out
and buy him a new Gameboy.

09:12.535 --> 09:13.593
Why would she want that?

09:13.703 --> 09:15.898
For God's sake, Alan,
you're paying this woman

09:16.005 --> 09:18.565
a lot of money.
I suggest you take her advice.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.439
Jake, we're going out.

09:24.347 --> 09:27.544
I just want to make it clear
that I would never behave in a way

09:27.617 --> 09:29.744
that would negatively influence
my nephew.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.888
What was that? Is she allowed to do that?

09:33.356 --> 09:35.847
Mr. Harper,
how many women would you say

09:35.925 --> 09:38.860
you have sexual relations with
in any given year?

09:38.928 --> 09:40.122
Excuse me.

09:47.303 --> 09:48.702
I do okay.

09:50.439 --> 09:52.407
Ten, twenty, one hundred?

09:52.875 --> 09:56.311
- Come on, I don't keep count.
- So we'll say, 10.

09:56.412 --> 09:58.073
I don't see the relevance of this.

09:58.147 --> 10:00.741
We are trying to establish
Mr. Harper's lifestyle

10:00.816 --> 10:04.149
as a way of determining whether
his home is a suitable environment

10:04.253 --> 10:05.311
for a young boy.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.446
Okay,
let me just say here that I love Jake

10:07.556 --> 10:10.992
and I make it my business to see
that nothing goes on in front of him

10:11.093 --> 10:13.926
- that is in any way inappropriate.
- You tell him, Charlie.

10:14.797 --> 10:17.322
And it's significantly north of 10.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.765
I think we can move on.
Do you have any more questions?

10:28.611 --> 10:32.012
- You are doing very well.
- Thanks.

10:33.983 --> 10:38.579
Mr. Harper, is it true that Jake saw
a woman in the shower with you?

10:38.854 --> 10:40.287
Okay, yes.

10:41.490 --> 10:44.948
Now in that instance,
the door was closed,

10:45.027 --> 10:46.426
he didn't knock,

10:46.495 --> 10:50.261
and the door was closed and...

10:51.934 --> 10:54.596
And I'm sorry, what was the question?

10:56.806 --> 10:59.274
- Woman in the shower?
- Don't help them.

11:01.544 --> 11:04.672
And most important,
he didn't see anything inappropriate.

11:04.847 --> 11:08.943
Then, what can you tell us
about this picture that Jake drew?

11:13.656 --> 11:16.853
Okay, now that's a totally different...
Whoa, man!

11:19.362 --> 11:21.296
Whoa-man. Woman.

11:23.632 --> 11:26.396
She was in my kitchen wearing a T-shirt

11:26.502 --> 11:28.402
and she reached up for some...

11:31.507 --> 11:32.997
SpaghettiOs.

11:34.877 --> 11:37.368
That's what she was reaching for.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.713
I'd like a moment
to confer with my witness.

11:42.752 --> 11:46.313
You are making me so hot.

11:47.423 --> 11:48.583
I see.

11:50.359 --> 11:54.591
Look, Stuart, we both know
you're on a fishing expedition here, right?

11:56.565 --> 11:58.999
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

11:59.435 --> 12:03.269
You have no case.
This man is a wonderful uncle.

12:03.372 --> 12:05.033
He provides a beautiful home,

12:05.107 --> 12:06.506
and the last time I looked,

12:06.575 --> 12:10.238
it wasn't against the law to be single
in the United States of America.

12:10.346 --> 12:11.677
Oh, God!

12:15.351 --> 12:16.511
Bless America!

12:19.288 --> 12:20.380
Amen.

12:24.693 --> 12:27.856
The good news is your wife has given up
on the custody issue,

12:27.930 --> 12:30.398
but we still need to finalize
the property settlement.

12:30.466 --> 12:31.524
All right.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.127
Now, aside from your books,
she's requested a few other specific items.

12:35.237 --> 12:38.365
- Like what?
- A massage chair?

12:38.441 --> 12:41.410
Oh, no. Forget it. I love that chair.

12:42.478 --> 12:46.073
That was the only thing in my bedroom
that moved when I touched it.

12:47.216 --> 12:49.309
Don't worry, Alan.
I will get you your chair.

12:49.418 --> 12:52.717
I will get you your books.
I will fight for you. I will win for you.

12:52.788 --> 12:56.554
And I won't stop until your wife
is squished like a bug on a windshield.

12:57.393 --> 13:01.625
Okay, let's not lose sight of the fact
that this bug is the mother of my child.

13:02.398 --> 13:04.559
So let's just keep the squishing
to a minimum.

13:05.468 --> 13:08.164
Don't worry, you don't need a bathing suit.

13:08.304 --> 13:11.273
Once you're drunk,
the ocean's not cold at all.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.164
- Charlie.
- Hey, Alan.

13:16.645 --> 13:17.771
And Laura.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.581
Hello, Laura.

13:22.084 --> 13:23.449
I didn't know you were here.

13:23.619 --> 13:26.554
- Hi, Charlie, Crystal.
- Hey.

13:28.357 --> 13:30.825
Yeah, I guess you guys know each other.

13:32.828 --> 13:33.988
How's that flu?

13:35.464 --> 13:36.624
It's better.

13:40.369 --> 13:43.827
This calls for a drink. A very large drink.

13:46.609 --> 13:50.136
I'm not getting billed for her time now,
am I?

13:58.487 --> 13:59.715
Charlie?

14:00.022 --> 14:01.819
Okay, I know this is awkward,

14:01.891 --> 14:03.859
but let's keep in mind we agreed

14:03.959 --> 14:08.123
that you and I were just a casual deal, two
consenting adults, no strings, no drama.

14:08.731 --> 14:11.859
I'm willing to admit
that trying to boink your assistant might...

14:11.967 --> 14:14.458
- Charlie!
- Yeah?

14:15.204 --> 14:16.228
Now.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.330
What?

14:18.674 --> 14:21.575
I want you now.

14:22.144 --> 14:26.808
But see, now's really not a good time.
I mean, you're working with my brother

14:26.882 --> 14:28.577
and Crystal took a sick day.

14:33.055 --> 14:35.046
Okay, that's a good point.

14:36.158 --> 14:38.217
Let me think this through.

14:40.195 --> 14:42.720
All right,
there's just one way to make this work.

14:42.831 --> 14:44.423
I don't do threesomes, Charlie.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.234
- Then I'm stumped.
- What's going on?

14:48.771 --> 14:50.363
Nothing. Not a thing.

14:51.006 --> 14:54.066
- Charlie, there's no reason to lie.
- Are you sure?

14:54.276 --> 14:55.436
There usually is.

14:57.079 --> 15:00.913
I'm a little upset with your brother
for getting involved with my assistant.

15:01.016 --> 15:03.450
I mean,
it could be construed as a breach of ethics.

15:03.686 --> 15:06.348
Nice going, Charlie.
This won't affect my case, will it?

15:06.422 --> 15:08.447
No, of course not, Alan. I'm a professional.

15:08.591 --> 15:11.856
If we're going to make it
to that settlement conference on time

15:11.927 --> 15:15.021
maybe you should put on a jacket and tie.
Nothing too nice.

15:15.564 --> 15:16.588
You're good.

15:16.699 --> 15:20.226
Do you think you can keep it
in your pants till I get my stuff back?

15:21.737 --> 15:24.069
I'm trying harder than you think.

15:26.542 --> 15:29.272
Okay, we've got 15 minutes.
Where do you want to do this?

15:29.378 --> 15:30.902
Hold on.

15:31.714 --> 15:36.151
It's not that I'm not into risky,
semi-public sex,

15:37.052 --> 15:40.544
it's just that I am starting to resent
your attitude.

15:41.056 --> 15:42.785
Charlie, we have a deal.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.787
Okay, Laura, look.

15:47.496 --> 15:49.327
I only went along with that because

15:50.165 --> 15:54.625
you are hot,
and it took little to no effort on my part.

15:57.606 --> 16:01.337
Just make yourself at home, Crystal.
That's the ocean.

16:05.848 --> 16:09.011
Anyway, I think we might be done here.

16:09.585 --> 16:11.348
- You're dumping me?
- Yep.

16:12.955 --> 16:14.013
Now.

16:16.258 --> 16:19.193
You are going to be very sorry,
Charlie Harper.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.136
Yeah, girls have been using that tired
old line on me since the fifth grade.

16:32.107 --> 16:37.010
The next item is the rare book collection
appraised at $12,000.

16:37.179 --> 16:39.977
Actually,
our appraisers came in at $16,500.

16:40.049 --> 16:42.313
- Yeah.
- Enjoy them.

16:46.789 --> 16:47.847
What?

16:47.956 --> 16:51.119
- I was only asking for half.
- Why break up a collection?

16:51.193 --> 16:52.785
Okay, what's next?

16:53.062 --> 16:55.724
I understand there's a dispute
over the massage chair.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.298
Not anymore. We concede.

16:57.733 --> 17:00.224
What do you mean we concede?
We're not here for conceding.

17:00.335 --> 17:03.304
We're here for fighting and winning
and squishing, remember?

17:03.372 --> 17:07.809
- Alan, I know what I'm doing.
- Okay, moving on to the retirement fund.

17:07.876 --> 17:08.968
- Take it.
- Take it?

17:09.044 --> 17:10.170
- Take it.
- I'll take it.

17:11.012 --> 17:12.674
Are you out of your mind?

17:12.748 --> 17:15.215
- Okay, what else would you like?
- What else?

17:17.219 --> 17:20.655
Judith, for God's sake, remember
there was a time when you loved me!

17:38.107 --> 17:39.404
Cool.

17:43.579 --> 17:44.637
That was quick.

17:44.747 --> 17:47.614
Yeah,
like every other time Judith screwed me.

17:52.621 --> 17:55.590
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.491
My settlement conference turned
in to a drive-by colonoscopy.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.132
Charlie, have you ever heard
of a divorce agreement

18:05.234 --> 18:06.826
that requires the ex-husband

18:06.935 --> 18:11.269
- to pay the ex-wife's dry cleaning for life?
- Wow.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.807
Yeah, not just clothes.

18:13.308 --> 18:15.139
Drapes, rugs,

18:15.911 --> 18:19.278
slip covers, even suede.

18:20.649 --> 18:23.413
Sounds like she really took you
to the cleaners.

18:25.587 --> 18:26.815
Sorry.

18:27.489 --> 18:30.424
So I fired Laura
and tore up the agreement.

18:30.926 --> 18:34.089
I'm going to have to find a new attorney
and just start all over.

18:34.163 --> 18:36.529
Good, then. No harm, no foul.

18:37.299 --> 18:40.598
Except for the thousands of dollars
of extra legal fees.

18:40.803 --> 18:42.828
Yeah, that's got to sting a little.

18:42.971 --> 18:46.964
Not as much as having to buy Judith's
parents a retirement condo in Boca Raton.

18:48.310 --> 18:51.370
She didn't even ask for that.
Laura just threw it in.

18:52.848 --> 18:53.974
Lawyers.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.351
But you know what
the interesting thing is?

18:57.452 --> 18:58.544
No, what?

18:58.954 --> 19:00.444
After it was all over

19:00.556 --> 19:03.616
and Judith and her attorney
went dancing out of the room,

19:04.927 --> 19:07.919
I asked Laura
why she had done this to me,

19:07.996 --> 19:12.296
and she said, and I quote,
"Ask your brother. "

19:15.838 --> 19:19.205
So here I am asking you.

19:20.609 --> 19:22.042
Why, Charlie?

19:23.912 --> 19:27.780
Why did my very expensive
Beverly Hills divorce lawyer sell me out?

19:31.687 --> 19:34.178
Okay. I'll tell you the whole story.

19:35.691 --> 19:38.091
But maybe you should sit down first.

21:19.261 --> 21:20.455
