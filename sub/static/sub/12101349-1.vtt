03:06.136 --> 03:07.763

03:27.991 --> 03:29.159
I'm sorry, Sifu.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.786
I'm sorry.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.461
Who did this?

03:42.506 --> 03:43.841
Carter.

03:43.882 --> 03:47.678
He said his Gung Fu was better
so I challenged him to abeimo.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.222
But I won, Sifu.
I won for our honor.

03:51.890 --> 03:52.891
Bite.

04:09.658 --> 04:10.701
Honor...

04:17.416 --> 04:19.335
Gung Fu without honor...

04:20.753 --> 04:22.046
is just fighting.

04:25.591 --> 04:27.843
No more beimo.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.929
No more challenges.

04:31.013 --> 04:32.306
Yes, Sifu.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.153
Ah

04:46.195 --> 04:48.197
Sport that look
Full looking like champ

05:03.253 --> 05:04.630

- Whoa.

05:07.424 --> 05:11.136
We have master

05:20.062 --> 05:22.022

05:23.565 --> 05:24.608

Oh! Ooh!

To a hard-core beat

So get that whistle...

Oh-hohoho!

06:14.074 --> 06:15.534
Hey, Danny.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.618
Getting ready for the fight?

06:16.660 --> 06:17.786
Yeah, man.

06:17.828 --> 06:19.121
Who are your friends here?

06:21.373 --> 06:23.083
- No way!
- What are you wearing?

06:23.125 --> 06:24.793
You look like you're out
of a kung fu movie.

06:24.877 --> 06:27.046
Whoa, no, no, bro, straight out
of a fortune cookie.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.172
Look at the duds.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.174
Whoa, ey, ey!

06:30.215 --> 06:31.467
All right, All right.

06:31.508 --> 06:32.760
You ready, Danny?

06:33.302 --> 06:34.386
All right.

06:35.054 --> 06:37.181

06:37.222 --> 06:39.683
Let's go, Dai Si-Hing!

06:39.725 --> 06:41.643
Versus Carter.

06:41.685 --> 06:44.313
- Good, man.
- Danny's just toying with him.

06:45.898 --> 06:47.858
Ooh, Carter.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.360
Oh-hohoho!

06:50.277 --> 06:51.320
Oh!

06:52.363 --> 06:54.239
Here, Danny.

06:54.281 --> 06:57.284
Here we go, Hing!
Three Tigers, baby!

06:58.744 --> 06:59.953
Oh, ow!

06:59.995 --> 07:01.413
Yes, yes, Hing!

07:01.455 --> 07:02.748
You nearly killed the guy!

07:03.957 --> 07:05.459
Go, go, go, Jim!

07:05.501 --> 07:07.169
Show him some Gung Fu!

07:07.211 --> 07:09.046
Oh, shit, the cops.
Look, the cops.

07:09.088 --> 07:10.422
Let's go, Jim!

07:14.134 --> 07:16.428
Carter always loses.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.097
I'm not gonna take my jacket
off this time.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.765
Watch.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.141
Okay, Dai Si-Hing?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.036
Oh! Oh!

07:41.078 --> 07:42.997
Undefeated!

07:43.038 --> 07:44.790
Danny Eight Hands.

07:44.873 --> 07:46.208
The Three Tigers, baby.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.292
- What do we say?
- Forever.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.211
Come on, open it.

07:49.253 --> 07:50.546
God, God, God.

07:53.966 --> 07:55.217
What does it say?

07:56.927 --> 07:58.053
I'm in.

07:58.137 --> 08:00.597
- You're going to Japan?
- We're going to Japan!

08:03.809 --> 08:05.102
We're gonna be rich!

08:06.562 --> 08:09.189
Japan, Japan, Japan!

08:19.658 --> 08:22.578
Shi-Gong, welcome
the new disciples to our clan.

08:34.256 --> 08:36.550
I swear I will always honor
my sifu.

08:36.592 --> 08:40.387
I will be loyal to my brothers
and I will defend the weak.

08:40.429 --> 08:45.100
This I promise as a disciple
to the very day I die.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.495
Right.

09:48.247 --> 09:50.624
Come on, man,
someone please leave.

09:50.666 --> 09:52.334
Anybody, anybody?

09:52.418 --> 09:53.460
Are you leaving?

09:53.502 --> 09:55.045
There.

09:55.087 --> 09:56.547
Here we go, here we go.

10:02.136 --> 10:04.513
Yo! Okay, yeah, just go through.

10:07.683 --> 10:08.684
All right.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.022
Don't... don't put...
Don't put it...

10:13.063 --> 10:14.565
Oh, come on.

10:19.278 --> 10:20.446
Just put it in!

10:20.487 --> 10:21.947
Come on!

10:25.451 --> 10:26.869
- I'll be back in a minute, lady.
- What, you can't!

10:26.910 --> 10:31.206
- Just one minute, just one.
- Ah, uh... your car.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.335
Hey.

10:34.376 --> 10:36.253
- Hi.
- Which one's the fastest?

10:36.295 --> 10:37.838
Your call has been forwarded

10:37.880 --> 10:39.715
to an automated
voice messaging system.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.053
I'm sorry, baby,
he's not answering.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.596
Could you call again?

10:45.637 --> 10:48.015
Honey, I don't think
we can keep on waiting.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.769
Hey, we can go
to the comic store.

10:51.810 --> 10:54.021
You know, another weekend
reading with mom?

10:54.688 --> 10:56.231
No, yeah.

10:56.315 --> 10:57.649
I'm sick of that, too.

11:00.152 --> 11:01.362
Boom!

11:01.403 --> 11:02.613
Hey, buddy.

11:02.654 --> 11:03.697
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:03.822 --> 11:06.825
But I had to go I clear across
town to get you this, like it?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.369
- Yeah!
- Yeah? It's cool, right?

11:08.410 --> 11:10.412
Just look at that little antenna
too so check it out.

11:10.496 --> 11:11.538
You got a supercharger here

11:11.580 --> 11:13.207
and it's really cool,
it's really amazing.

11:13.248 --> 11:15.000
Hey, Caryn!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.710
You're looking great,
I love the hair.

11:16.752 --> 11:17.878
It's very now.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.421
Ever the charmer.

11:19.463 --> 11:21.507
Mm-hm, yeah.
So we really should get going.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.675
I got a big day ahead of us.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.218
Hey, a big day.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.011
What you got planned?

11:26.095 --> 11:28.597
Well, we got the whole weekend
ahead of us to, you know,

11:28.639 --> 11:31.266
two full days
of all kinds of stuff.

11:31.308 --> 11:33.102
- Stuff?
- Mm-hm.

11:33.143 --> 11:34.645
Well, day and a half now, so...

11:34.687 --> 11:36.105
Nah, it's plenty of time.

11:36.146 --> 11:37.481
To?

11:39.358 --> 11:41.568
To go to...

11:44.363 --> 11:45.656
Magic Land.

11:47.658 --> 11:49.535
Ma... Magic Land?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.328
- You got it, buddy.
- Magic Land?

11:51.370 --> 11:52.663
It was supposed to be
a surprise,

11:52.705 --> 11:54.164
but, hey, did you bring
swim trunks?

11:54.206 --> 11:56.625
Don't worry about it. We could
pick some up on the way.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.252
Hey, isn't that a bit much?

11:58.293 --> 12:00.004
By the time you get through
the gates, it'll be dark.

12:00.045 --> 12:02.423
We're gonna make it, I promise.

12:02.464 --> 12:04.508
- I promise.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

12:08.971 --> 12:10.014
Okay.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.598
Yes!

12:13.809 --> 12:15.185
- Hey.
- Hmm?

12:15.227 --> 12:18.188
You said you wanted
50/50, right?

12:18.230 --> 12:21.275
When you say you're gonna
do something, do it.

12:21.859 --> 12:23.902
My word is bond.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.654
Cross my heart, hope to die.

12:26.655 --> 12:28.365
I got it.

12:28.407 --> 12:30.242
There's fireworks,
we gotta stay for that.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.661
- Yes!
- 10:00 p.m., I think, uh...

12:32.703 --> 12:34.538
that should be pretty fun.
Okay, all right.

12:34.580 --> 12:35.914
There he is. That's him!

12:35.956 --> 12:38.083
All right, all right, calm down.
I'll take care of it.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.127
- Hey, bud, is this you?
- Yep, it is.

12:40.169 --> 12:41.670
I told her I'd be back
in a minute.

12:41.712 --> 12:43.255
- A minute?
- Don't worry about it.

12:43.297 --> 12:44.465
I had an appointment!

12:44.506 --> 12:46.342
I've been here for 10,
she's been here for 20.

12:46.383 --> 12:48.385
- I'm late!
- Hey!

12:48.427 --> 12:50.763
- I'm talking to you, dork!
- Mm, hi.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.348
You think you own this place?

12:52.389 --> 12:54.141
Don't you people know
how to park?

12:54.224 --> 12:56.685
No, can't park, can't drive,
can't help it.

13:04.902 --> 13:06.153
- Dad?
- Yeah, buddy?

13:06.195 --> 13:08.113
Do you know any kung fu?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.865
First of all,
it's called Gung Fu.

13:09.907 --> 13:11.367
That's how we say it in Chinese.

13:11.408 --> 13:13.077
But, no, I don't, why?

13:13.118 --> 13:14.119
I saw pictures.

13:14.203 --> 13:15.788
- Where?
- In the garage.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.456
There's a bunch of pictures.

13:17.498 --> 13:19.375
All right, all right,
you got me.

13:19.416 --> 13:21.752
That was a very, very, very
long time ago.

13:21.794 --> 13:23.545
Who's the old guy?

13:23.587 --> 13:24.713
The old guy?

13:26.757 --> 13:28.050
That was our teacher.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.094
We called him "Sifu".

13:31.553 --> 13:33.263
- You know what that means?
- Mm-mm.

13:33.305 --> 13:35.933
Si means master.

13:35.974 --> 13:37.309
Fu means father.

13:39.269 --> 13:40.729
Can you show me Gung Fu?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.148
What for?

13:44.441 --> 13:46.360
Listen, a lot of boneheads think

13:46.443 --> 13:48.237
they can solve everything
with their fists,

13:48.278 --> 13:50.030
like that guy back there, right?

13:50.989 --> 13:52.366
You know what to do?

13:52.408 --> 13:54.535
You do what dad did,
you just be a bigger man

13:54.576 --> 13:55.577
and walk away.

13:57.413 --> 14:00.040
Hey, so what's the first thing
you wanna do in Magic Land, huh?

14:00.791 --> 14:02.793
Mount Splash!

14:02.835 --> 14:05.462
Mount Splash, that's right.

14:05.504 --> 14:07.923
Now we're gonna do that first
and then we're gonna do...

14:07.965 --> 14:10.718
- Vanilla Chunky Pie!
- Vanilla Chunky Pie!

14:10.759 --> 14:12.136
That's right.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.015
Please don't answer.

14:17.808 --> 14:19.351
Please, please, don't.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.271
Hello?

14:24.189 --> 14:26.233
Wait, what do you mean
it didn't go through?

14:26.275 --> 14:29.111
We, we had everything
signed for.

14:29.194 --> 14:31.822
I understand,
I'm on it right now.

14:31.864 --> 14:33.907
I give you my word
that it's gonna be fixed

14:33.949 --> 14:36.035
before you get
to the office, yes.

14:51.425 --> 14:53.427
Getting really heavy,
you know that?

15:25.584 --> 15:27.419
Ah!

15:27.461 --> 15:28.712
Tiger pounces on cave!

15:31.757 --> 15:33.258
Come on, show me what you got!

15:33.342 --> 15:35.969
- No.
- Seriously, nothing?

15:36.011 --> 15:37.262
- Oh!
- What about now?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.472
- What about now?
- Jesus.

15:42.393 --> 15:43.977
- Ah Hing?
- Yeah!

15:44.019 --> 15:45.437
What are you, crazy?

15:45.479 --> 15:46.605
What the hell's wrong with you?

15:46.647 --> 15:49.149
What's wrong with you?
I... Whoa.

15:49.191 --> 15:51.068
Hey, kid. He yours?

15:51.110 --> 15:53.404
Hey.

15:53.445 --> 15:55.948
He's a good-looking kid.
Doesn't look like you at all.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.491
How can you forget?

15:57.533 --> 16:00.035
I mean,
"Tiger pounces from cave!"

16:00.077 --> 16:02.746
You just sink, twist under,
elbow strike!

16:02.788 --> 16:03.872
Wanna go again?

16:03.914 --> 16:05.040
I'm retired.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.544
Look at that.

16:08.585 --> 16:10.921
A Gung Fu man's always ready,
Dai Si-Hing.

16:31.942 --> 16:33.068
You doing all right?

16:33.110 --> 16:34.236
What, this?

16:36.321 --> 16:39.742
Fell off a scaffold at work
about ten years ago.

16:41.410 --> 16:43.829
Shit, man.

16:43.871 --> 16:46.707
Yeah, it was their busted
equipment anyways.

16:46.749 --> 16:47.916
Now I get a fat check
every month

16:47.958 --> 16:49.001
for the rest of my life.

16:49.043 --> 16:50.544
Hmm. Pretty sweet.

16:52.463 --> 16:56.175
Sifu taught you
Chinese medicine.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.927
Don't you have like some way
to heal it?

17:03.640 --> 17:05.142
You didn't hear?

17:07.061 --> 17:08.228
Sifu's dead.

17:15.027 --> 17:16.028
What?

17:16.737 --> 17:18.654
Heart attack.

17:18.697 --> 17:20.615
Out behind the restaurant.

17:20.657 --> 17:22.409
The other cooks found him
in the morning.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.373
He must have been there
the whole night.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.999
How, how was he doing?

17:29.041 --> 17:30.709
Was he sick at all?

17:30.751 --> 17:33.712
I haven't seen the old man
in 15 years.

17:33.754 --> 17:35.547
I'm lucky
I still found you here.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.467
Funeral's tomorrow.

17:39.593 --> 17:41.929
Yeah, yeah, of course.

17:42.012 --> 17:43.597
I'll drop Ed off with his mom.

17:45.766 --> 17:47.309
Should we tell Jim?

17:50.896 --> 17:52.481
I'm not going if he's going.

17:59.029 --> 18:00.364
Hey, buddy.

18:00.406 --> 18:04.118
We're gonna go and do Magic Land
next weekend, okay?

18:04.159 --> 18:05.244
I swear.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.793
Buddy.

18:12.835 --> 18:14.920
I need you to do me
one last thing.

18:14.962 --> 18:17.464
If your mom asks
about yesterday,

18:17.506 --> 18:19.842
tell her that we went to
Magic Land like we said we did.

18:20.718 --> 18:22.177
Isn't that lying?

18:22.219 --> 18:23.637
Yes.

18:23.679 --> 18:26.473
Yes, it is,
but it would hurt her even more

18:26.515 --> 18:29.143
if she found out
that we didn't go.

18:29.184 --> 18:32.271
She might not let us spend time
together anymore.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.397
Don't you wanna see me again?

18:35.232 --> 18:36.775
Promise to say we went?

18:39.862 --> 18:41.196
Promise.

18:55.252 --> 18:57.588
You begged me to do 50/50.

18:57.629 --> 18:59.048
You wanted to be a part of this.

18:59.089 --> 19:00.299
And now you drop off
your son

19:00.341 --> 19:01.633
like he's some sort of pet?

19:01.675 --> 19:04.928
Danny, stop making me out
to be the bad guy.

19:05.679 --> 19:06.805
Call me back.

19:10.017 --> 19:11.060
Ed?

19:12.811 --> 19:14.188
Ed.

19:17.983 --> 19:20.027
Did he even take you
to Magic Land?

19:22.696 --> 19:24.948
We had Vanilla Chunky Pie.

19:46.804 --> 19:48.555
Shit, it's Carter.

19:48.597 --> 19:49.723
Where?

19:49.765 --> 19:51.517
- Ah, yeah, that's him.
- Yeah.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.601
He's a lot bigger.

19:52.643 --> 19:54.353
All right, here they come.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.817
- Sifu Wong.
- Sifu Wong.

19:59.858 --> 20:02.111
Eh, just the two of you?

20:02.152 --> 20:03.278
What about, Ah...

20:04.113 --> 20:05.781
Oh, uh, Ah Jim? Uh...

20:05.823 --> 20:09.243
- He's, uh, really busy.
- Yeah.

20:09.284 --> 20:10.786
Do you have the funeral cloth?

20:12.037 --> 20:13.622
Uh...

20:13.664 --> 20:15.040
Wait here.

20:21.213 --> 20:22.256
There's a lot more people

20:22.297 --> 20:23.507
- than I thought.
- Yeah.

20:23.549 --> 20:25.926
A great Gung Fu master
deserves nothing less.

20:27.302 --> 20:28.387
It's a disgrace his disciples

20:28.429 --> 20:29.888
don't show their faces
until today.

20:29.972 --> 20:31.223
How you doing, Carter?

20:31.265 --> 20:32.766
Sifu Carter.

20:32.808 --> 20:33.851
I run the school now.

20:33.892 --> 20:35.352
Well, Carter...

20:35.394 --> 20:37.813
Not that I have to explain
anything to you

20:37.855 --> 20:39.732
but I just heard
about everything last night.

20:39.773 --> 20:43.235
Well, my Sifu took care of
all this here, doing your job.

20:43.277 --> 20:44.653
Showing up late to the funeral

20:44.695 --> 20:46.947
dressed in thrift-store suits,
totally shameful.

20:46.989 --> 20:48.741
You look skinny,
what are you, sick?

20:48.782 --> 20:50.451
You don't look skinny,
what are you, sick?

20:50.492 --> 20:51.994
I'm not fat, I'm bloated.

20:52.036 --> 20:53.329
We just had pasta.

20:53.370 --> 20:54.413
Pasta for breakfast?

20:54.455 --> 20:56.248
That's right, breakfast pasta.
You never heard of it?

20:56.290 --> 20:57.333
Sounds really healthy.

20:57.374 --> 20:59.376
You look like
a fat Asian Mr. Rogers.

20:59.418 --> 21:00.919
You know, you should really
watch the testosterone

21:00.961 --> 21:02.796
because it makes your...

21:06.550 --> 21:07.551
Here.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.353
I've been doing a lot
of push-ups, core workouts.

21:17.394 --> 21:18.520
Chest got a lot bigger.

21:18.562 --> 21:19.938
Yeah.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.690
- I got you.
- Just...

21:21.732 --> 21:23.859
- Watch, watch the hair.
- Okay, no, don't worry.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.239
Hey, hey, hey, yo, let's take
a picture with the master, yeah?

22:10.280 --> 22:12.491
Little selfie style,
cuz, yes, sir.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.159
Let's see, this...
that's one's a good one.

22:18.455 --> 22:21.125
- Mm-hm, that's...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:22.126 --> 22:24.503
Do something.

22:24.545 --> 22:26.380
They're making it look like
he was their sifu.

22:27.548 --> 22:29.008
Let's take these K-pop rejects.

22:29.049 --> 22:31.301
Hang on.

22:31.385 --> 22:34.555
I don't think Sifu would want
a brawl at his funeral.

22:50.279 --> 22:51.447
You guys are useless!

22:55.200 --> 22:56.201
What'd he say?

22:58.370 --> 23:01.874
You know, before any
of you were even born,

23:01.915 --> 23:04.209
I was a cook
just like your Sifu.

23:05.711 --> 23:08.213
He lent me the money
to open this school.

23:09.673 --> 23:12.426
I always told him that he could
open a school, too,

23:13.427 --> 23:15.012
and have more students,

23:16.221 --> 23:17.765
and have a bigger family.

23:21.226 --> 23:23.604
I think Sifu
was just happy being a cook

23:23.645 --> 23:26.982
and... teaching us.

23:27.024 --> 23:30.194
Yeah, "The Three Tigers
of Sifu Cheung."

23:32.946 --> 23:34.740
Do you know
if he was sick at all?

23:36.367 --> 23:37.409
Shouldn't you know?

23:38.786 --> 23:40.162
I read the autopsy.

23:41.121 --> 23:42.748
Cardiac arrhythmia.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.209
That means
his heart beat irregularly

23:45.250 --> 23:47.670
to the point of failure.

23:47.711 --> 23:50.923
Common causes
are congenital heart disease,

23:51.006 --> 23:53.467
inordinate stress,
pre-existing conditions.

23:53.509 --> 23:55.302
You sound so sure.

23:55.344 --> 23:57.137
I work in insurance.

23:57.179 --> 23:58.972
And Sifu smoked a pack a day

23:59.014 --> 24:01.225
so I guess we can't be
too surprised.

24:01.266 --> 24:04.061
Doctors.

24:04.103 --> 24:06.438
Westerners cannot see
what Gung Fu sees.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.108
Yeah, those pesky Westerners.

24:09.149 --> 24:10.526
Let me tell you what, Carter...

24:10.567 --> 24:11.610
Sifu Carter!

24:14.279 --> 24:16.365
- Listen, if you ask me...
- Uh, which I'm not.

24:16.407 --> 24:17.866
If you ask me...

24:19.076 --> 24:20.411
there was no heart attack.

24:22.413 --> 24:23.914
- And if I were you...
- Which you're not.

24:24.039 --> 24:25.249
If I were you...

24:27.418 --> 24:29.962
I'd start with those punks.

24:30.004 --> 24:32.423
Those kids have no respect
for any of the old ways.

24:41.890 --> 24:45.894
Speaking of old ways, Sifu Wong,

24:45.936 --> 24:47.438
Ah Hing and I were talking.

24:47.479 --> 24:48.939
And we think it's probably best

24:48.981 --> 24:51.150
that Sifu's ashes
stayed with you.

24:51.191 --> 24:53.193
But we're two different clans.

24:53.235 --> 24:54.278
Yeah.

24:55.696 --> 24:57.865
But I think Sifu would be happy

24:57.906 --> 25:00.117
in a place where Gung Fu
is at least practiced.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.328
Why not open your own school?

25:02.369 --> 25:03.787
Yeah.

25:03.829 --> 25:05.622
We Chinese have a saying.

25:11.503 --> 25:13.672
"A teacher for even one day

25:13.714 --> 25:16.925
becomes a father
for a lifetime."

25:16.967 --> 25:19.928
A fortune cookie
made with white flour.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.430
Relax.

25:23.390 --> 25:26.727
Sifu Wong, thank you again
for everything.

25:37.196 --> 25:38.739
What else do you know
about those kids?

25:38.822 --> 25:40.657
Gung Fu orphans.

25:40.699 --> 25:43.077
They never had a Sifu
to teach them anything proper

25:43.118 --> 25:44.203
so they just go out
in the street

25:44.244 --> 25:45.579
and practice on their own.

25:45.621 --> 25:47.373
Listen, those kids
will lie and cheat

25:47.414 --> 25:49.249
just to build up a name
for themselves.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.001
They could take those photos
from the funeral

25:51.043 --> 25:53.420
and claim your Sifu
was their master.

25:53.462 --> 25:54.922
You care at all about your Sifu,

25:54.963 --> 25:57.216
I'd find out exactly
what they were doing that night.

26:02.930 --> 26:04.473
What if he was
on to something?

26:04.515 --> 26:07.267
The Gung Fu meathead?

26:07.309 --> 26:10.604
Yeah, I think I'll side with
a certified coroner on this one.

26:10.729 --> 26:12.856
Sifu was so strict
with his morals.

26:12.898 --> 26:14.441
He could have set anyone off.

26:14.483 --> 26:17.027
What if he rubbed the kids
the wrong way, too?

26:17.069 --> 26:18.987
Okay, look, this is where
they found him.

26:23.575 --> 26:27.496
But why would Sifu come
all the way down here

26:28.372 --> 26:29.790
and not out to the street?

26:29.832 --> 26:31.333
Well, I don't think
you have a say

26:31.375 --> 26:32.793
when you're having
a heart attack.

26:35.212 --> 26:36.255
Are you done, Magnum?

26:37.506 --> 26:39.675
Just let the man rest in peace.

26:39.717 --> 26:41.093
Then we could all move on.

26:41.135 --> 26:42.219
Something's not right.

26:51.854 --> 26:53.522
What?

26:54.314 --> 26:56.066
Go!

26:56.108 --> 26:57.651
Ah!

27:03.323 --> 27:04.700
Oh, come on!

27:07.036 --> 27:09.371
Okay, that's not happening.

27:10.831 --> 27:12.166
That guy's so fast!

27:13.542 --> 27:14.626
Good form, too.

27:18.839 --> 27:20.507
We need Jim.

27:20.549 --> 27:21.550
Down, down!

27:21.633 --> 27:23.385
Got him where you want him,
now reel him on in.

27:24.595 --> 27:25.846
What are you dancing for?

27:25.888 --> 27:27.431
You gotta get in there
and take him down, bruh.

27:30.351 --> 27:32.561
Get in there and take him down!

27:32.644 --> 27:34.980
- Yeah!
- Oooh woo!

27:37.441 --> 27:38.650
Yeah!

27:38.692 --> 27:40.235
What'd I told you, huh?

27:40.277 --> 27:41.695
Stingray, baby!

27:41.737 --> 27:43.030
Stingray.

27:43.113 --> 27:45.157
That's not gonna work
with Doc Howard.

27:45.199 --> 27:46.450
He's tougher than this man.

27:46.492 --> 27:49.620
No, 'cause his hands can't hit
what he can't reach.

27:49.662 --> 27:52.623
'Cause I always stay
one step away.

27:54.249 --> 27:56.001
You gotta go to the ground!

27:56.043 --> 27:57.169
Dammit.

28:09.682 --> 28:12.559
Ah, yeah.

28:14.061 --> 28:15.521
Doesn't this get you
all juiced up?

28:17.064 --> 28:18.190
No.

28:20.109 --> 28:21.610
Nice.

28:21.652 --> 28:23.362
Nothing like
Fighting like...

28:23.404 --> 28:25.239
Now what?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.282
No, now whip your leg.

28:27.324 --> 28:29.410
Start with your feet
and do it right.

28:32.204 --> 28:33.580
More, get up faster!

28:33.622 --> 28:35.499
- You hear that?
- What?

28:35.541 --> 28:37.209
He ain't really kicking
that bag, man.

28:37.251 --> 28:38.919
He's gotta turn over
his hip.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.713
Faster, faster.

28:40.754 --> 28:42.214
See, speed kills.

28:42.256 --> 28:43.799
Hey!

28:43.841 --> 28:45.843
You got anal blindness?

28:45.884 --> 28:47.886
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

28:47.928 --> 28:51.265
Do you have anal blindness?

28:51.348 --> 28:52.766
Um, no.

28:52.808 --> 28:55.310
Then why can't your ass see
I'm working over here?

28:55.352 --> 28:57.604
Oh, we're... I'm sorry, sir,
we were just...

28:57.646 --> 29:00.816
At least this ass can see
that that's a shitty kick.

29:00.858 --> 29:01.984
The hell you talking about?

29:02.026 --> 29:03.360
Kick's got no power.

29:03.402 --> 29:05.154
Even my big brother
can tell you that.

29:06.155 --> 29:08.449
No power, huh?

29:08.490 --> 29:10.326
And what the hell
would you know about power?

29:10.909 --> 29:12.369
I don't hear it.

29:12.411 --> 29:14.705
When he hits the bag,
the sound isn't good.

29:14.747 --> 29:16.665
It's... it's too fat.

29:17.374 --> 29:18.459
Too fat?

29:18.500 --> 29:20.252
Yeah, you gotta have
a sharp sound.

29:20.294 --> 29:22.129
Just using his leg
isn't good enough.

29:22.171 --> 29:24.214
You gotta control all that power

29:24.256 --> 29:26.759
through your body
from the ground up.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.594
That's Chinese Gung Fu.

29:28.635 --> 29:31.430
See if you do it right,
you can hear the power.

29:31.472 --> 29:35.142
All right, Kung Fu Panda.

29:35.225 --> 29:37.936
Why don't you show us
something, huh?

29:37.978 --> 29:41.440
Let me hear how kung fu's
supposed to sound.

29:41.482 --> 29:44.068
Might help if you turn up
your hearing aid, but...

29:44.109 --> 29:45.110
I'll show you.

29:46.362 --> 29:47.654
You sure about this?

29:47.696 --> 29:50.074
Yeah, man, a little dojo busting
like the old days.

29:50.699 --> 29:51.909
Let's do this.

29:57.289 --> 29:58.832
I'll show you how it's done.

29:58.874 --> 30:01.251
I just gotta warm up first,
you know.

30:09.051 --> 30:13.472
Now see, if it's too close,
it's no good.

30:13.514 --> 30:17.226
If it's one step away further,
lose a lot of power.

30:17.309 --> 30:21.105
It's gotta be... just right.

30:21.146 --> 30:24.274
All I hear is your mouth,
fathopper.

30:31.490 --> 30:32.908
Argh!

30:32.950 --> 30:35.411
Oh, God!

30:35.452 --> 30:37.621
That sounds fat all right.

30:37.663 --> 30:39.915
That's how kung fu
supposed to sound?

30:39.957 --> 30:41.000
Ooh!

30:41.041 --> 30:43.168
Goddamn socks!

30:43.210 --> 30:44.503
I'll show you some realGung Fu,

30:44.545 --> 30:46.213
- Fred Sanford!
- Step up!

30:46.255 --> 30:48.632
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Come on!

30:48.674 --> 30:51.260
Let's go, Sanford, let's go!

30:55.639 --> 30:56.765
Ah Hing?

30:56.807 --> 30:58.350
These fools with you?

31:01.603 --> 31:02.771
Yeah, they with me.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.450
Three Tigers back again!

31:19.246 --> 31:20.331
So...

31:21.582 --> 31:23.709
And I got nothing

31:23.792 --> 31:27.129
No, I got nothing
Without you, baby

31:27.171 --> 31:29.381
You know the last time
I saw Dai Si-Hing,

31:29.423 --> 31:31.717
he was drinking me
under the table in Japan.

31:33.135 --> 31:34.219
Yeah.

31:34.261 --> 31:35.679
When was that, '93?

31:35.721 --> 31:36.764
Yeah.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.559
Let's keep drinking.

31:40.601 --> 31:43.979
All you gotta be is 20
to drink in Japan, right?

31:44.021 --> 31:47.816
So we flew in that night,
that first night in Tokyo.

31:49.276 --> 31:50.986
We went to town, man.

31:51.028 --> 31:53.822
And we tried to come back
to the hotel, but I'm out.

31:54.948 --> 31:56.367
Nothing's waking me up.

31:56.450 --> 32:01.705
No alarm, no earthquake,
no Godzilla.

32:01.747 --> 32:03.624
You know what I'm saying?

32:03.666 --> 32:08.712
So I get up the next evening
and go to find Dai Si-Hing,

32:08.754 --> 32:11.882
and he's checked out
of his room.

32:11.924 --> 32:15.386
He disappears before his fight.

32:15.469 --> 32:17.471
Who cares?
This was 25 years ago, come on.

32:17.513 --> 32:18.972
- We forfeited.
- Forfeited.

32:19.014 --> 32:20.641
I was your second, man.

32:20.683 --> 32:22.559
My name
was on the line, too.

32:23.477 --> 32:25.062
Own it, bruh.

32:26.146 --> 32:29.191
Danny Eight Hands,
you punked out.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.442
Hey, come on, come on.

32:30.526 --> 32:31.610
Come on, guys.

32:32.695 --> 32:33.862
We're brothers.

32:35.155 --> 32:37.491
I mean I love you, guys,
man, come on.

32:43.038 --> 32:44.581
You know what's funny?

32:44.623 --> 32:46.417
You guys arguing like this,

32:46.458 --> 32:49.962
but in 25 years neither of you
ever reached out for me.

32:51.422 --> 32:53.090
But it's not
about that, right?

32:54.091 --> 32:55.634
It's about Sifu.

33:00.472 --> 33:01.598
Sifu.

33:01.640 --> 33:02.975
- Sifu.
- Sifu.

33:06.895 --> 33:09.940
Sifu was a beast, man.

33:09.982 --> 33:12.067
You sure those kids could
have done something to him?

33:13.360 --> 33:15.112
Let's just get it done.

33:25.831 --> 33:28.208
Damn it!

33:28.250 --> 33:30.919
I've told you so many times.
You have to kick higher.

33:30.961 --> 33:32.588
Kick higher,
where's your energy at?

33:32.629 --> 33:34.590
- What are you doing?
- I've already told you.

33:34.631 --> 33:36.133
Hey, punk-ass,
you dropped that.

33:40.596 --> 33:42.556
The Three Tigers of Sifu Cheung.

33:45.351 --> 33:47.353
Sorry, we didn't recognize you
from before, I mean,

33:47.394 --> 33:49.980
you look like
you ate half of that guy.

33:50.022 --> 33:51.815
And homie,

33:51.857 --> 33:53.734
man, you been fasting
for 20 years or what?

33:53.776 --> 33:55.152
You used to be the man.

33:55.194 --> 33:57.780
So you knew Sifu Cheung?

33:57.821 --> 34:00.115
The cooks told us
you all work together.

34:00.157 --> 34:02.451
What were you gonna do with
those photos at the funeral?

34:02.493 --> 34:05.704
A great master
deserves true disciples.

34:05.746 --> 34:07.748
He already has them.

34:07.790 --> 34:10.125
What do you punk-asses know
about being a true disciple?

34:11.251 --> 34:13.796
- Show him.
- What?

34:13.837 --> 34:16.006
Oh, jeez. You should have
been ready for this.

34:16.048 --> 34:18.008
I wasn't expecting you
to do that.

34:18.050 --> 34:19.093
See this?

34:19.134 --> 34:20.426
Nice rash, bitch.

34:20.511 --> 34:23.013
This makes him
the official clan inheritor,

34:23.055 --> 34:24.223
our Dai Si-Hing!

34:24.263 --> 34:25.432
You guys have that?

34:25.474 --> 34:27.434
Nope, posers.

34:27.475 --> 34:31.021
But that don't mean shit
unless you live up to it.

34:31.062 --> 34:33.524
People paid big money
to fly him to Japan

34:33.564 --> 34:35.859
to be a professional fighter.
You know why?

34:35.901 --> 34:38.779
Because he's Danny Eight Hands,
the Destroyer!

34:38.821 --> 34:40.489
We're wasting our time here.

34:40.531 --> 34:42.741
Better make
that shit count, homie.

34:42.825 --> 34:44.033
Anytime you want, nigga.

34:44.952 --> 34:45.995
Boy, what you say to me?

34:46.035 --> 34:47.329
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh.

34:47.370 --> 34:49.289
I said knuckle up, nigga!
You heard me.

34:49.330 --> 34:51.250
Catch this fade, homie!
Square up, let's go!

34:51.291 --> 34:52.917
Shh. Okay, okay, wait,
hold, hey, hey!

34:52.960 --> 34:54.712
Boy, you don't want
any of this, bruh.

34:54.753 --> 34:56.588
- Let's go.
- I'm telling you right now!

34:56.629 --> 34:58.257
- Walk away, man.
- Dai Si-Hing!

34:58.298 --> 34:59.550
We can't let these bitch asses

34:59.591 --> 35:00.843
- talk to us like that.
- Exactly!

35:00.884 --> 35:02.219
They offended Sifu, one.

35:02.261 --> 35:04.638
Two, they offended family, okay?
That's Ah Jim right here.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.849
If we don't do anything,
that makes him look weak.

35:06.890 --> 35:09.018
- Exactly.
- And that makes him oppressed.

35:09.059 --> 35:10.853
We defend the oppressed
because we're like the

35:10.894 --> 35:12.271
Martin Luther Kings
of martial arts.

35:12.312 --> 35:14.273
That's three strikes
right there.

35:14.314 --> 35:15.482
That's actually just two.

35:16.775 --> 35:19.028
It doesn't matter,
we're good to go!

35:19.069 --> 35:21.447
I was... I was actually with you
up until that last part

35:21.488 --> 35:23.782
about Dr. King,
this is not true.

35:26.035 --> 35:28.579
These sushi-eating motherfuckers
have offended us.

35:28.620 --> 35:29.788
I like sushi.

35:31.749 --> 35:32.833
We gotta let 'em know.

35:34.084 --> 35:35.127
Dai Si-Hing.

35:36.503 --> 35:38.088
You got my back or what?

35:40.883 --> 35:42.968
- Okay.
- Yeah?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.720
- You feel that?
- Okay. Yeah.

35:44.762 --> 35:46.221
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.

35:46.263 --> 35:47.806
- Let's go get their asses.
- We got these guys.

35:47.848 --> 35:49.641
All right.

35:49.683 --> 35:51.143
- You want beimo?
- Hell, yeah.

35:51.185 --> 35:52.936
First to knock out,
best of three.

35:52.978 --> 35:54.521
If we win, you tell us
everything we need to know.

35:54.563 --> 35:55.981
And when we win?

35:56.023 --> 35:58.317
Yeah, mm-hm, win? Pfft!

35:58.359 --> 35:59.985
If you beat us,

36:00.027 --> 36:02.613
I guess that means
we're not undefeated anymore.

36:02.654 --> 36:04.948
You guys can be
the new Three Tigers.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.743
- You'll give us the name?
- Mm-hm.

36:07.785 --> 36:09.036
How do we believe you?

36:09.119 --> 36:10.746
Because that's what we do.

36:12.289 --> 36:14.041
Sifu would always say,

36:14.083 --> 36:16.543
Gung Fu without honor
is just fighting.

36:16.585 --> 36:18.212
You're on, old pops.

36:18.253 --> 36:20.839
Get ready for an ass whooping
of a lifetime, just, uh...

36:20.881 --> 36:22.466
I got vertigo,
I can't go down this way.

36:22.508 --> 36:23.592
- Let's go this way.
- You son of a bitch.

36:23.634 --> 36:24.718
Which way?

36:24.802 --> 36:27.763
Uh, what are you doing?

36:27.805 --> 36:29.348
Hang on, hang on, Ah Jim!

36:29.390 --> 36:30.724
Wait, where you guys going?

36:35.771 --> 36:36.814
Beimo.

36:36.855 --> 36:38.691
Whoa.

36:38.732 --> 36:40.526
Okay, hang on a second.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.903
You see, uh...

36:42.945 --> 36:45.155
seniors usually go last
in beimo.

36:45.197 --> 36:47.616
You know, the whole seniority...

36:49.618 --> 36:50.619
thing.

36:53.580 --> 36:54.665
Okay.

37:02.506 --> 37:03.590
Okay, let's go.

37:04.174 --> 37:05.217
Let's go, pops.

37:19.356 --> 37:22.401
Ooh! That's whassup!

37:22.443 --> 37:24.069
- Come on, Danny.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.487
How's that feel, old man?

37:27.281 --> 37:29.241
- Let's go...
- Come on, Danny, let's go!

37:29.283 --> 37:30.451
Let's go, Dai Si-Hing.

37:30.492 --> 37:32.286
- Get up, come on.
- Danny.

37:32.328 --> 37:33.537
What now, Tigers?

37:33.579 --> 37:34.913
Where's your
Danny Eight Hands at?

37:36.248 --> 37:37.583
More like Danny No Hands!

37:37.624 --> 37:39.376
- Whoa!
- Yo-ho!

37:40.627 --> 37:42.880
Oops. Spoke too soon.

37:42.921 --> 37:44.423
Let's go, Danny.

37:44.465 --> 37:45.507
- Come on.
- Let's go, Danny!

37:46.967 --> 37:48.010
Okay.

37:49.345 --> 37:50.471
Let's go, Danny.

37:50.512 --> 37:51.847
Let's go, Danny.

37:55.517 --> 37:57.269
That ain't nothing!

37:57.311 --> 37:58.937
Go to work!

37:58.979 --> 38:01.607
You ain't got nothing, baby.
You ain't got nothing!

38:04.651 --> 38:05.736
Oh, oh.

38:05.778 --> 38:07.488
Ow!

38:07.529 --> 38:10.282
Hey, wait. Hold on,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

38:10.324 --> 38:11.450
Oh.

38:13.410 --> 38:15.162
That old man broken, yo!

38:18.499 --> 38:19.583
Yeah, go!

38:19.625 --> 38:21.752
Oh, shit, oh shit!

38:21.794 --> 38:24.421
Look at that, oh, my goodness,
yeah, yeah.

38:24.463 --> 38:25.964
Let's go, that's right,
that's right.

38:26.006 --> 38:27.383
How'd that taste, old man?

38:27.424 --> 38:29.301
Yeah, yeah. Come on,
let's... let's go.

38:29.343 --> 38:31.428
- Good night, bitch.
- Come on, let's go get him.

38:35.766 --> 38:37.101
- Okay, hold, hold him.
- I got him.

38:42.981 --> 38:44.233
Okay, okay, okay.

38:44.274 --> 38:46.068
- Relax, relax, relax.
- What... what happened?

38:46.110 --> 38:47.903
Okay, come on, come on.

38:47.945 --> 38:49.238
Wait, why are they
laughing at us?

38:50.698 --> 38:52.783
Okay, what are they
gonna do? Ouch.

39:00.124 --> 39:01.667
Okay, come on, Hing.

39:22.771 --> 39:24.398
Get him.

39:38.996 --> 39:41.415
Oh, yeah, yeah,
knocked your teeth out.

39:54.678 --> 39:56.305
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

39:56.347 --> 39:57.681
Oh.

40:05.064 --> 40:07.608
Keep laughing, keep laughing.

40:10.069 --> 40:11.236
Ah!

40:16.033 --> 40:18.160
Get up! Fu, get up!

40:18.202 --> 40:19.745
Oh, shit!

40:22.373 --> 40:24.625
Whoa. Okay, Hing, Hing!

40:24.667 --> 40:27.711
This is what happens
when you play with grown men!

40:27.753 --> 40:29.254
Hing, you got him already.

40:30.964 --> 40:32.049
Whoa!

40:34.468 --> 40:36.178
- No, wait a minute.
- Hing, Hing, Hing.

40:36.220 --> 40:38.806
- Hey, hey, Hing...
- Take out the trash!

40:38.847 --> 40:40.599
You can't do that,
that's not kung fu!

40:40.641 --> 40:42.267
Honor, Hing! Ho...

40:46.397 --> 40:48.565
- C'mon, Fu!
- Tie game! Yeah!

40:50.067 --> 40:51.110
C'mon, Fu!

40:53.737 --> 40:55.239
That's what you get!

40:55.280 --> 40:56.865
- That's my man.
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

40:56.907 --> 40:58.158
- I'm good.
- All right.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.910
- Shit's foul, man.
- We got this.

41:00.035 --> 41:01.245
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

41:03.789 --> 41:05.207
What's wrong, you scared?

41:05.249 --> 41:07.501
Um, I forgot the salute.

41:09.003 --> 41:10.838
- What?
- What do you mean you forgot?

41:10.879 --> 41:14.258
I don't quite remember
exactly what to do.

41:14.299 --> 41:15.968
- But, uh...
- Forget it.

41:45.122 --> 41:46.123
Okay.

41:48.417 --> 41:50.252
Oh-hohoho, it's close one, eh?

41:50.294 --> 41:51.378
Come on.

41:51.462 --> 41:52.671
Oh, okay.

42:13.984 --> 42:15.611
Ooh!

42:17.404 --> 42:19.573
- Yes, sir!
- That's what's up!

42:20.657 --> 42:22.493
- Come on, Ah Jim.
- Get up, get up!

42:22.534 --> 42:24.119
- Boi, come on.
- Can't even get up.

42:24.161 --> 42:25.663
Meow. Let's go.

42:25.704 --> 42:26.747
Come on, has-been.

42:26.789 --> 42:28.540
Yeah, what's up?

42:28.624 --> 42:29.750
Come on, old man.

42:29.792 --> 42:31.335
- I dare you!
- Paper Tiger, what's up?

42:31.377 --> 42:33.879
Let's go!

42:36.215 --> 42:37.383
Get up, yo, get up!

42:37.424 --> 42:38.550
- Get up!
- Come on, get up!

42:38.592 --> 42:40.010
I got you!

42:41.929 --> 42:43.597
- Come on, get up!
- All day, baby!

42:43.639 --> 42:46.016
- All day!
- Out, he's out, get off!

42:46.058 --> 42:47.726
Out, he's out already, he's out!

42:51.563 --> 42:53.774
Yeah, that's my nigga.

42:57.236 --> 43:00.197
What?

43:00.239 --> 43:02.241
Three Tigers,
still undefeated, baby.

43:02.282 --> 43:03.742
Yes, sir!

43:04.785 --> 43:06.578
Man, that was fun.

43:16.338 --> 43:18.757
Hold him up.

43:19.758 --> 43:20.843
Really?

43:34.898 --> 43:36.025
Now, honor your word.

43:37.860 --> 43:39.486
What was your relationship
with Sifu Cheung?

43:40.946 --> 43:42.239
I asked him once
if he'd teach us.

43:42.281 --> 43:43.657
What'd he say?

43:43.699 --> 43:45.409
He wasn't having it.

43:45.451 --> 43:47.953
He swore he'd never teach anyone
anything anymore.

43:47.995 --> 43:50.956
He was always screaming
about ungrateful disciples.

43:50.998 --> 43:54.668
He slammed a butcher knife
onto the block and broke it.

43:54.710 --> 43:56.086
Sifu was always good to me.

43:57.629 --> 43:59.715
We'd never do anything
to hurt him.

43:59.757 --> 44:01.467
Delete all the photos
you took at the funeral.

44:01.592 --> 44:03.010
All of it.

44:03.052 --> 44:04.720
I don't want anyone
getting the wrong idea.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.267
We might be a disgrace,

44:12.311 --> 44:14.897
but Sifu
had only three disciples.

44:17.149 --> 44:18.817
Hey, yo, man, sorry,
I called you nig...

44:20.152 --> 44:21.320
the N-word.

44:30.162 --> 44:31.330
I found it.

44:31.372 --> 44:34.875
Right behind
your gonorrhea pills.

44:36.543 --> 44:38.003
Oh.

44:38.087 --> 44:39.380
Is it still good?

44:39.421 --> 44:41.090
- Yeah, it's good.
- Oh, man.

44:41.131 --> 44:42.883
The longer the Jow ferments,
the better.

44:42.925 --> 44:44.051
Rub me down then, nurse.

44:44.093 --> 44:46.595
My god, you still believe
in that stuff?

44:46.637 --> 44:48.180
Mm.

44:48.222 --> 44:49.223
I'll be good to go.

44:50.057 --> 44:52.726
Aah, in the morning.

44:52.768 --> 44:54.311
Yeah, well, I'm good to go now.

44:55.604 --> 44:57.231
Somebody had to carry the team.

44:57.272 --> 44:58.482
You mean we had to

44:58.524 --> 45:00.109
- carry the team.
- Okay.

45:00.150 --> 45:01.568
I'll drink to that.

45:03.570 --> 45:04.905
I bet you Carter knew

45:04.947 --> 45:07.116
the whole time
those kids were a bust.

45:07.157 --> 45:09.076
We should get to Sifu Wong's
early tomorrow,

45:09.118 --> 45:10.744
see if he's heard anything new.

45:10.786 --> 45:13.163
We would have killed those kids
in our prime.

45:13.205 --> 45:14.289
It's weird.

45:16.208 --> 45:18.794
It's like I could feel
what I needed to do.

45:21.005 --> 45:23.507
Where to move, but like...

45:25.300 --> 45:26.719
my body wouldn't listen.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.178
Getting old, my man.

45:28.220 --> 45:29.513
Body's slowing down.

45:29.596 --> 45:30.806
Sifu never slowed down.

45:30.848 --> 45:32.474
Sifu's not everybody.

45:34.018 --> 45:37.563
None of us
could touch him, ever.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.606
Well, that's 'cause
Sifu was fast.

45:41.483 --> 45:43.193
I wasn't fast, I was first.

45:45.112 --> 45:47.072
- Same thing.
- Same thing, right?

45:47.114 --> 45:48.282
No.

45:50.159 --> 45:51.910
You remember doing meditations?

45:53.162 --> 45:55.539
When I had it just right,

45:55.581 --> 45:59.418
I was the most relaxed
I'd ever been.

45:59.460 --> 46:03.547
I could feel
the color in the grass.

46:04.423 --> 46:05.799
It was intense.

46:05.841 --> 46:08.469
So anytime we went to beimo

46:08.510 --> 46:11.013
when I had my breathing down
just right,

46:11.055 --> 46:12.848
I could get the world
to slow down.

46:14.391 --> 46:17.728
I, I mean, I could feel
the other guy's muscles

46:17.770 --> 46:22.066
tensing up long before
he even would try to punch.

46:22.107 --> 46:24.735
That's how I would
always hit first.

46:24.777 --> 46:27.488
I knew what the other guy
was going to do

46:27.529 --> 46:29.031
before he even thought of it.

46:29.073 --> 46:30.074
What?

46:30.157 --> 46:32.910
No, no, there's...
there's something to that.

46:32.951 --> 46:35.162
It's like when I fell off
the scaffold.

46:35.204 --> 46:37.247
I mean it was only
ten feet high, but...

46:38.332 --> 46:39.500
it seemed like

46:39.541 --> 46:42.878
it was the longest time before
I actually hit the ground.

46:45.631 --> 46:47.758
It was a trip.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.052
Think you could have pulled that
on Sifu?

46:50.094 --> 46:51.220
Oh, jeez.

47:06.193 --> 47:10.239
You know, if you would have
came with us to Japan,

47:10.280 --> 47:14.910
maybe you could have talked
some sense into Dai Si-Hing.

47:14.952 --> 47:17.246
I couldn't leave Sifu alone
like that.

47:17.287 --> 47:18.622
Teacher's pet, huh?

47:20.916 --> 47:22.543
We were all equally his sons.

47:22.584 --> 47:25.754
No, no, you were definitely
his favorites.

47:25.796 --> 47:27.506
Dai Si-Hing,
he inherits the clan.

47:27.548 --> 47:29.174
You? You learned how to heal.

47:29.216 --> 47:31.135
What do I get?

47:31.176 --> 47:32.469
You get to eat the chicken.

47:33.345 --> 47:34.972
I'mma forget that.

47:35.014 --> 47:37.141
I'mma forget that you said that.

47:46.150 --> 47:47.192
What?

47:49.570 --> 47:52.531
Did he teach you poison fingers?

47:52.573 --> 47:54.450
Come on, man.

47:54.491 --> 47:58.620
"You want to learn
poison finger, you work hard...

47:58.662 --> 48:01.123
- for 20 more years!"
- "For 20 more years!"

48:02.750 --> 48:04.126
Yeah.

48:07.921 --> 48:08.964
No.

48:11.550 --> 48:12.801
After you two left,

48:12.843 --> 48:14.595
old man lost his heart
for fighting.

48:15.804 --> 48:17.139
So all we did was medicine.

48:24.271 --> 48:26.190
Do you think the poison fingers
is real?

48:28.984 --> 48:31.820
Every good Gung Fu man
keeps a secret.

49:08.941 --> 49:11.151
Imagine if we all stayed...

49:11.193 --> 49:13.195
cooped up in that garage...

49:14.613 --> 49:17.950
With the old man sitting over
in the corner and smoking,

49:18.951 --> 49:20.369
watching horse racing.

49:22.287 --> 49:24.999
When we gather up all the kids
in the neighborhood and teach...

49:28.877 --> 49:29.962
for free.

49:32.673 --> 49:33.799
Is that so bad?

49:35.759 --> 49:37.344
Well, you gotta eat.

49:39.346 --> 49:40.431
You gotta pay rent.

49:41.974 --> 49:42.975
Yeah.

49:45.811 --> 49:48.397
When the old folks in Chinatown
couldn't afford treatment,

49:49.356 --> 49:50.482
Sifu would offer to do

49:50.524 --> 49:52.443
free clinics for them
on the weekends.

49:52.484 --> 49:55.112
Because it was
"honorable and righteous".

49:55.154 --> 49:56.530
Yeah, "righteous".

49:56.572 --> 49:57.740
Guess who he expected

49:57.781 --> 49:59.283
to come out to work
for free, too?

50:00.743 --> 50:01.785
Of course.

50:02.911 --> 50:04.496
Man, I'll be honest.

50:04.538 --> 50:06.373
I mean I was doing
hotel security back then,

50:06.457 --> 50:09.084
I mean I was getting paid,
it's good money.

50:09.126 --> 50:12.004
So taking a day off from work
for a bunch of senior citizens

50:12.046 --> 50:15.215
that can only repay you
with flowers and vegetables,

50:15.257 --> 50:17.009
I mean that's nice,
but you know.

50:19.762 --> 50:21.930
That day that Sifu needed me,

50:23.599 --> 50:24.892
I didn't say anything to him.

50:26.393 --> 50:27.811
I'd just go to my hotel job.

50:31.106 --> 50:33.984
Funny thing is,
he doesn't call me.

50:35.235 --> 50:36.612
He doesn't come looking for me.

50:38.947 --> 50:41.867
A week rolls by,
I still don't hear from him.

50:41.909 --> 50:43.327
So now I don't know
what to expect.

50:43.369 --> 50:45.996
I mean, is he mad? Depressed?

50:47.623 --> 50:49.166
He already lost you two, right?

50:53.379 --> 50:54.421
But...

50:57.174 --> 50:58.967
I never got up the courage...

51:00.886 --> 51:02.179
to show my face

51:04.890 --> 51:07.893
and just man up
and say I'm sorry.

51:12.731 --> 51:17.361
Now, Sifu dies all alone
in a goddam alley.

51:20.614 --> 51:22.783
Can't put that
all on yourself, man.

51:24.743 --> 51:27.955
Gung Fu means
nothing without your word.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.042
I mean if we promise
to do something...

51:34.795 --> 51:37.256
we better do it, right?

51:54.648 --> 51:55.691
Shit.

52:03.699 --> 52:04.742
Shit.

52:24.553 --> 52:25.596
Shit!

52:40.611 --> 52:42.446
Yeah, let's go.

52:58.128 --> 52:59.672
Ah, shit. Oh, shit.

53:00.923 --> 53:02.049
Ah!

53:02.091 --> 53:05.219
The Three Tigers of Sifu Cheung
finally back together.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.428
Is Sifu Wong in?

53:06.470 --> 53:08.097
Oh, he just stepped out
for a walk.

53:08.138 --> 53:09.264
Should be back soon though.

53:09.306 --> 53:10.766
You're more than welcome
to come in.

53:10.808 --> 53:12.309
Have some tea while you wait?

53:12.351 --> 53:13.727
Tea?

53:13.769 --> 53:15.312
You won't wanna fight
or nothing, huh?

53:15.354 --> 53:16.397
No.

53:20.734 --> 53:21.860
Danny Four Feet.

53:26.782 --> 53:27.950
Anybody smell Rogaine?

53:31.578 --> 53:32.788
I remember
picking these leaves

53:32.830 --> 53:35.249
from the Tian Shan
mountain range.

53:35.290 --> 53:36.458
Plucked 'em from the top.

53:50.014 --> 53:51.056
Heard about yesterday.

53:53.726 --> 53:55.686
Tough times
for Danny Eight Hands.

53:58.272 --> 53:59.398
How did you hear about that?

53:59.481 --> 54:01.984
Nobody gossips like the Chinese.

54:02.026 --> 54:03.902
Oh, no, no, it's online.

54:03.944 --> 54:06.030
Yeah, the kids put up
a play-by-play and everything.

54:07.656 --> 54:09.116
You're internet famous.

54:10.951 --> 54:12.369
Son of a bitch.

54:13.579 --> 54:15.539
Oh, forgot to like it.

54:15.581 --> 54:18.292
Yeah, but what do you expect
these days?

54:18.334 --> 54:20.210
Nobody cares about
the code of beimo anymore.

54:20.252 --> 54:22.588
Used to be about respect.

54:22.629 --> 54:24.048
You'd fight,
and no matter who won...

54:25.382 --> 54:27.092
nobody talked about it
afterward.

54:27.134 --> 54:30.095
Carter, those kids had no idea
how Sifu died.

54:30.137 --> 54:32.556
Well, it was worth a shot,
right?

54:33.640 --> 54:37.227
Actually, for you, more like
five straight shots to the head.

54:37.269 --> 54:38.520
Definitely worth it.

54:38.562 --> 54:42.483
So you knew it was
a dead end, huh? You set us up.

54:42.524 --> 54:45.069
No, I didn't know
what they knew.

54:45.110 --> 54:46.737
Just thought it'd be
a better bet for them

54:46.779 --> 54:49.740
to face off against you,
the great Three Tigers.

54:51.450 --> 54:53.243
Well, the old you.

54:53.285 --> 54:56.622
Then again the now you
is the old you.

54:58.499 --> 55:00.501
Or is it the lesser you?

55:00.542 --> 55:02.086
Anything else you figured out?

55:04.546 --> 55:06.548
- I got a couple of ideas.
- And?

55:06.590 --> 55:08.258
So sad.

55:09.134 --> 55:10.803
A toast!

55:10.844 --> 55:12.888
To the once great
Danny Eight Hands.

55:12.930 --> 55:14.014
- I...
- What are you doing?

55:14.056 --> 55:15.933
- I didn't know he'll say that.
- Put it down.

55:15.974 --> 55:17.935
Time sure catches up
to some people.

55:17.976 --> 55:19.937
And it doesn't change a thing
for others.

55:19.978 --> 55:21.897
I think I might have changed
just a little bit.

55:24.441 --> 55:25.734
Not like you.

55:29.196 --> 55:30.823
At least it's natural.

55:30.864 --> 55:33.117
We'll look for Sifu Wong
when he gets back.

55:33.826 --> 55:35.160
You want a theory?

55:35.202 --> 55:37.454
- Okay, here we go.
- No, no, not really.

55:37.496 --> 55:40.332
How about your Sifu took on
another disciple?

55:40.374 --> 55:42.626
We're his only sworn disciples.

55:42.668 --> 55:43.794
I was with him last.

55:43.836 --> 55:45.879
Yeah, 15 years ago?

55:45.963 --> 55:47.464
Plenty of time
to raise somebody new.

55:47.506 --> 55:48.841
Who is it then?

55:52.344 --> 55:53.721
- Beimo?
- There it is.

55:54.513 --> 55:57.349
There it is.

56:00.936 --> 56:02.229
What?

56:02.271 --> 56:06.025
When the hands cross,
all will be revealed.

56:06.817 --> 56:07.901
Best of three.

56:07.943 --> 56:10.112
Hell, make it easy.

56:10.154 --> 56:13.407
Three matches, but only one
of you has to beat me.

56:26.045 --> 56:28.547
When'd you get so cocky, man?

56:28.589 --> 56:30.799
I like it.

56:30.841 --> 56:32.801
What do you say,
Dai Si-Hing?

56:32.843 --> 56:33.886
What if we lose?

56:42.895 --> 56:44.521
Can you just say it in English?

56:44.563 --> 56:46.190
I mean, just say it
in English, man.

56:46.231 --> 56:48.025
Because we can't understand.

56:48.067 --> 56:49.401
The fiercest tigers...

56:50.611 --> 56:53.489
can never share
the same mountain.

56:55.115 --> 56:56.825
You pick yourself up
off the floor

56:58.077 --> 56:59.953
and you get the hell
out of my school.

57:09.088 --> 57:10.881
All right.

57:10.923 --> 57:13.133
Come on, Ah Jim, you're first.
Make Sifu proud.

57:13.175 --> 57:15.678
Yeah, yeah.

57:15.719 --> 57:17.554
Man, I hope you brought
your ground game.

57:17.596 --> 57:20.849
Otherwise, I'm putting you
to sleep.

57:20.891 --> 57:23.435
Oh, are you gonna use
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on me?

57:24.687 --> 57:26.438
Forgot your Gung Fu already?

57:40.869 --> 57:41.870
Dragon!

57:43.956 --> 57:45.708
Snake!

57:45.749 --> 57:47.167
Oh, my god.

57:49.586 --> 57:50.587
Tiger!

57:53.757 --> 57:54.842
Cock!

57:56.719 --> 57:58.053
Crane.

58:15.863 --> 58:17.740
This is like what?

58:17.781 --> 58:19.116
You serious?

58:20.367 --> 58:21.410
Okay.

58:39.470 --> 58:41.096
Oh, come on, Jim.

58:41.138 --> 58:42.264
You think you're smart, huh?

58:42.306 --> 58:43.599
You wanna dance with me?

58:58.364 --> 58:59.448
Did he hit me?

58:59.490 --> 59:00.657
No, it's just a glance, man.

59:00.699 --> 59:02.117
- It's fine...
- You got this...

59:02.159 --> 59:03.369
It's fine.

59:08.999 --> 59:10.125
Oh.

59:14.963 --> 59:16.131
All right.

59:20.969 --> 59:22.513
Uh-huh. Come on!

59:22.554 --> 59:23.639
Uh-huh.

59:30.396 --> 59:31.814
Ooh!

59:31.855 --> 59:33.649
- Get up, come on, get up!
- Come on, Jim, get up.

59:33.691 --> 59:35.484
- Let's do it.
- That ain't nothing.

59:47.287 --> 59:48.414
Panther!

59:49.331 --> 59:50.708
Oh!

59:54.294 --> 59:55.421
Woo!

59:55.462 --> 59:56.505
Oh!

59:56.547 --> 59:58.465
Come on.

59:58.507 --> 59:59.925
Come on. Okay, yeah.

59:59.967 --> 1:00:02.511
Oh, Grandmaster Chan?

1:00:02.553 --> 1:00:03.554
We did it.

1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:06.181
We did it!

1:00:06.265 --> 1:00:07.307
Ooh!

1:00:13.147 --> 1:00:14.148
One down.

1:00:15.232 --> 1:00:16.525
Two to go.

1:00:16.567 --> 1:00:17.818
It's not fair, Carter.

1:00:17.860 --> 1:00:19.403
You're cheating
with all that baby oil.

1:00:19.445 --> 1:00:21.321
He just beat our best guy.

1:00:21.363 --> 1:00:22.573
Oh, no offense.

1:00:22.614 --> 1:00:23.699
All right.

1:00:26.327 --> 1:00:27.453
What about a...

1:00:28.454 --> 1:00:30.289
handicap for your handicap?

1:00:30.414 --> 1:00:31.915
Use any weapon you want.

1:00:31.957 --> 1:00:33.042
First blood?

1:00:33.751 --> 1:00:34.960
Even a pin prick.

1:00:36.170 --> 1:00:38.213
Fine. But you're the prick.

1:00:38.255 --> 1:00:40.424
- No, you're the prick.
- I'm the pin, you're the prick.

1:00:40.466 --> 1:00:41.633
No, you're the prick.

1:00:41.675 --> 1:00:42.760
And I'm pinning you

1:00:42.801 --> 1:00:44.219
with my prick...
with your prick.

1:00:44.261 --> 1:00:45.304
Ew.

1:00:45.346 --> 1:00:46.555
Just pick a weapon!

1:01:23.133 --> 1:01:25.177
Oh.

1:01:51.453 --> 1:01:52.705
Wha...

1:02:01.005 --> 1:02:02.089
Not the hair, not the hair!

1:02:02.131 --> 1:02:03.590
No, no, no, no!

1:02:30.034 --> 1:02:32.703
No, no, no, no!

1:02:33.412 --> 1:02:35.289
No, no, no, no!

1:02:43.339 --> 1:02:44.506
Bald eagle.

1:03:10.908 --> 1:03:12.326
That's it.

1:03:12.409 --> 1:03:13.994
- He's doing his breathing.
- Yeah.

1:03:14.036 --> 1:03:15.954
That's it, Dai Si-Hing,
nice and easy.

1:03:33.097 --> 1:03:34.723
Yes, oh, yeah!

1:03:34.765 --> 1:03:36.767
Yes!

1:03:36.809 --> 1:03:38.769
Yes, Danny!

1:03:39.645 --> 1:03:40.729
Okay, okay, careful!

1:03:56.537 --> 1:03:57.830
Oh, no, no, no.

1:03:57.871 --> 1:03:58.998
Come on.

1:04:11.176 --> 1:04:13.721
Aah!

1:04:17.558 --> 1:04:18.809
Come on, come on.

1:04:26.066 --> 1:04:28.318
Wait, Carter!

1:04:42.916 --> 1:04:44.043
Did I win?

1:04:45.711 --> 1:04:47.671
Carter.

1:04:47.713 --> 1:04:49.882
What, Sifu?
We're just playing around.

1:04:50.841 --> 1:04:52.176
I was only going half power.

1:04:52.259 --> 1:04:53.802
You are not that strong.

1:04:56.221 --> 1:04:57.431
I am that strong.

1:04:58.057 --> 1:05:00.601
Sifu Wong?

1:05:00.642 --> 1:05:03.812
Did our Sifu
take in a new disciple?

1:05:03.854 --> 1:05:06.648
No, never.

1:05:14.698 --> 1:05:17.743
Then why is Carter going on
about another disciple?

1:05:21.372 --> 1:05:22.748
Carter!

1:05:28.295 --> 1:05:30.422
Last winter,
I received a challenge letter.

1:05:30.464 --> 1:05:32.966
Wanted to fight me here
at the school.

1:05:33.008 --> 1:05:35.511
He'd already been around
to the other masters and...

1:05:35.594 --> 1:05:37.179
he'd beaten them all bad.

1:05:37.221 --> 1:05:38.722
Did you win?

1:05:41.558 --> 1:05:43.185
You got your butt kicked,
didn't you?

1:05:43.227 --> 1:05:44.353
I didn't lose!

1:05:46.855 --> 1:05:48.315
I didn't win either.

1:05:49.942 --> 1:05:51.235
When he was on his way here,

1:05:51.276 --> 1:05:54.405
I locked up the school,
turned out the lights.

1:05:54.446 --> 1:05:55.989
Stayed up here until he left.

1:05:57.866 --> 1:06:00.452
Your Sifu came over
to personally apologize.

1:06:03.497 --> 1:06:06.083
Said his disciple was
totally out of control.

1:06:06.125 --> 1:06:09.461
He actually said that,
"his disciple"?

1:06:11.171 --> 1:06:13.298
Where can we find this guy?

1:06:13.340 --> 1:06:14.758
Try the Dungeon.

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:16.010
His type might hang out there.

1:06:16.051 --> 1:06:17.386
The Dungeon?

1:06:17.428 --> 1:06:19.304
- You know this?
- Oh, yeah.

1:06:19.346 --> 1:06:21.432
They say it's a mob front.

1:06:21.473 --> 1:06:24.393
Bunch of journeymen who do
enforcer work on the side.

1:06:24.435 --> 1:06:26.645
This guy turned his back
on your Sifu,

1:06:26.687 --> 1:06:29.064
got mixed up with the Triads.

1:06:29.106 --> 1:06:32.067
Sifu Cheung swore he would
take back his Gung Fu.

1:06:32.109 --> 1:06:33.235
You're saying they fought?

1:06:35.070 --> 1:06:36.280
How'd Sifu lose?

1:06:39.283 --> 1:06:40.951
Oh, come on.

1:06:43.871 --> 1:06:44.997
Oh!

1:06:46.582 --> 1:06:48.042
My head's killing me.

1:06:48.083 --> 1:06:50.127
Could be.

1:06:50.210 --> 1:06:53.255
You did get knocked out twice
in one day.

1:06:53.297 --> 1:06:55.966
All that blood pressure
squeezing your brain

1:06:56.008 --> 1:06:57.676
against your skull.

1:06:57.718 --> 1:06:58.802
It's what killed Bruce Lee.

1:07:03.891 --> 1:07:05.517
Oh, there you go.

1:07:05.559 --> 1:07:06.810
Oh.

1:07:06.852 --> 1:07:09.146
- Mm-mm.
- Trust me, it works.

1:07:17.780 --> 1:07:19.823
Is that what I think it is?

1:07:29.917 --> 1:07:31.377
Oh.

1:07:31.418 --> 1:07:32.795
Really?

1:07:32.836 --> 1:07:35.089
The holy grail.

1:07:35.130 --> 1:07:36.173
Yes!

1:07:40.010 --> 1:07:41.637
Why are we here?

1:07:41.679 --> 1:07:43.806
Oh, Carter always loses.

1:07:44.890 --> 1:07:46.892
This is when you put it on him.

1:07:46.934 --> 1:07:48.769
You dismantled him this time,
I remember this.

1:07:48.852 --> 1:07:51.563
I'm not gonna take
my jacket off this time. Watch.

1:07:51.605 --> 1:07:52.940
Okay, Dai Si-Hing?

1:07:58.737 --> 1:08:01.824
Oh, he's mad, oh!

1:08:01.865 --> 1:08:04.034
I still can't believe
he just waxed all our asses.

1:08:07.997 --> 1:08:10.249
Oh!

1:08:10.290 --> 1:08:11.458
Come on, open it.

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:13.460
God, God, God.

1:08:15.671 --> 1:08:17.296
What does it say?

1:08:17.339 --> 1:08:18.715
I'm in.

1:08:18.757 --> 1:08:19.758
You're going to Japan?

1:08:19.842 --> 1:08:21.760
We're going to Japan!

1:08:22.970 --> 1:08:25.304
We're gonna be rich!

1:08:27.599 --> 1:08:30.019
Japan, Japan, Japan!

1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:36.400
Danny?

1:08:36.442 --> 1:08:38.110
How are you gonna tell Sifu?

1:08:44.282 --> 1:08:45.659
Oh, what is that?

1:08:45.701 --> 1:08:47.119
Oh, yum.

1:08:50.914 --> 1:08:52.499
- Chicken!
- Oh, damn.

1:08:52.541 --> 1:08:54.960
- Oh, yeah!
- We were always mealing, man.

1:08:55.001 --> 1:08:56.253
Sifu's cooking?

1:08:56.295 --> 1:08:57.463
What are you guys eating?

1:08:57.504 --> 1:08:58.589
Careful, Hing.

1:08:58.630 --> 1:08:59.757
You're gonna get fat.

1:08:59.798 --> 1:09:00.924
He's gonna get so fat.

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:04.845
That's nasty.

1:09:04.887 --> 1:09:06.263
Oh.

1:09:06.304 --> 1:09:09.266
Hey, guys, wait for Sifu!

1:09:09.308 --> 1:09:11.184
- Sifu!
- See, man, I told you.

1:09:11.226 --> 1:09:13.394
You always got
the best piece of chicken.

1:09:15.981 --> 1:09:17.441
It's true!

1:09:17.483 --> 1:09:18.692
Oh, thank you, Sifu.

1:09:18.733 --> 1:09:20.443
I'm going to slow down,
calm down...

1:09:20.486 --> 1:09:21.695
Oh! Oh.

1:09:21.737 --> 1:09:23.530
Okay, go ahead, go ahead
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:09:23.572 --> 1:09:24.865
What? Ah, too slow!

1:09:24.907 --> 1:09:27.451
Master your chopsticks, yes.

1:09:27.492 --> 1:09:29.577
Okay, now, before we start.

1:09:30.996 --> 1:09:32.373
Happy birthday, Jim.

1:09:32.414 --> 1:09:33.581
Thank you, Sifu.

1:09:33.624 --> 1:09:34.750
Happy birthday, Jim.

1:09:34.791 --> 1:09:37.878
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:40.589
But this is
all for me, right, Sifu?

1:09:40.630 --> 1:09:41.674
You can't eat all that.

1:09:41.715 --> 1:09:43.008
You're not sharing?

1:09:48.806 --> 1:09:51.724
- Not "I", it's "We".
- We. We!

1:09:51.767 --> 1:09:53.769
- It's for us!
- We.

1:10:02.653 --> 1:10:04.571
Really, stairs?

1:10:04.613 --> 1:10:07.324
This ain't exactly
handicap-friendly.

1:10:07.366 --> 1:10:09.535
Not that I'm handicapped.

1:10:09.576 --> 1:10:11.036
You sure this is the spot?

1:10:11.078 --> 1:10:13.497
Yeah, so keep your head
on a swivel, understand?

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:18.252
So, uh, how do we find
this guy, huh?

1:10:18.293 --> 1:10:21.839
Easy. Find the one
that hits the hardest.

1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:24.008
Find the one
that hits the hardest?

1:10:24.049 --> 1:10:25.175
How?

1:11:36.163 --> 1:11:37.247
Any luck?

1:11:37.289 --> 1:11:39.750
Man, everybody here looks like
they can put the hurt on.

1:11:39.792 --> 1:11:41.460
I mean, what are we looking for?

1:11:41.502 --> 1:11:43.295
Not looking, listen.

1:11:43.921 --> 1:11:44.963
What?

1:11:51.804 --> 1:11:53.764
Ah Hing, talk to me.

1:12:07.069 --> 1:12:09.238
That's... the sound.

1:12:12.032 --> 1:12:13.033
Whoa.

1:12:17.871 --> 1:12:19.248
Damn.

1:12:39.977 --> 1:12:41.437
Let's go. Go, go!

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.566
That's too close, man.

1:12:45.607 --> 1:12:47.651
- What are we doing?
- What are you doing?

1:12:54.074 --> 1:12:55.409
Get ready to do
that U-turn, man.

1:12:55.451 --> 1:12:56.577
Get ready to do the U-turn.

1:12:57.870 --> 1:13:00.331
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go!

1:13:00.372 --> 1:13:03.208
I know, I know, I know!
I know, hold on, hold on!

1:13:03.250 --> 1:13:04.626
You're driving
like a soccer mom!

1:13:04.668 --> 1:13:05.919
Danny!

1:13:05.961 --> 1:13:07.004
I know, hold on, hold on.

1:13:07.046 --> 1:13:08.422
What are you doing,
a 3-point turn?

1:13:08.464 --> 1:13:09.506
U it, just U it!

1:13:12.885 --> 1:13:13.969
Slow down, just slow down.

1:13:14.011 --> 1:13:15.429
Why are you all up on him
like that?

1:13:15.471 --> 1:13:17.806
- You are on his ass.
- Just don't look at him.

1:13:17.848 --> 1:13:19.808
- Don't look at him?
- Just don't look.

1:13:21.977 --> 1:13:23.437
Are you serious right now?

1:13:23.479 --> 1:13:24.563
Oh.

1:13:24.605 --> 1:13:26.023
Now speed up, speed up,
speed up.

1:13:26.065 --> 1:13:27.566
You guys are exhausting.

1:14:02.267 --> 1:14:04.478
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:06.230
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

1:14:06.271 --> 1:14:08.273
I'll be right back,
I promise, okay?

1:14:13.237 --> 1:14:14.780
- Take your hood off.
- What, why?

1:14:14.822 --> 1:14:16.448
- Take your hood off!
- What?

1:14:16.490 --> 1:14:17.783
Today's special,
three courses,

1:14:17.825 --> 1:14:19.034
$8.95, you want it?

1:14:19.076 --> 1:14:21.662
- No, we don't want any food.
- Hey, table's not free.

1:14:21.704 --> 1:14:24.081
Okay, then we'll have some tea.

1:14:24.123 --> 1:14:25.666
If you don't eat,
tea's not free.

1:14:26.709 --> 1:14:27.876
He's gonna pay.

1:14:36.510 --> 1:14:38.429
Sorry about that...

1:14:46.311 --> 1:14:47.396
Nice suit.

1:14:51.567 --> 1:14:53.819
Oh, here he comes. Don't look,
don't look, just pretend.

1:14:53.861 --> 1:14:55.195
Use your peripheral.

1:14:58.198 --> 1:14:59.533
I got this.

1:16:09.603 --> 1:16:11.355
Hey, where's the wine?

1:16:13.649 --> 1:16:15.693
He... he did it,
I saw him, he did it.

1:16:15.734 --> 1:16:17.569
I heard it. I...

1:16:17.611 --> 1:16:20.114
- Where'd... where'd he go?
- Don't worry.

1:16:20.155 --> 1:16:21.615
We got him right where
we want him.

1:16:21.657 --> 1:16:23.409
- What do you mean?
- He kicked his bike over.

1:16:23.450 --> 1:16:26.495
- You what?
- It weighs over 400 pounds!

1:16:26.537 --> 1:16:28.622
He can't go anywhere,
now we can get him right now.

1:16:28.664 --> 1:16:30.332
No, no, he's a hitman.

1:16:30.374 --> 1:16:32.376
- He's a Gung Fu hitman.
- What?

1:16:32.418 --> 1:16:34.211
Yeah, he didn't even
wash his hands. He...

1:16:35.671 --> 1:16:37.631
- Somebody get help!
- Go call 911!

1:16:37.673 --> 1:16:39.425
- Please, help!
- Somebody help!

1:16:39.466 --> 1:16:40.884
Oh, I don't know.

1:16:40.926 --> 1:16:42.011
Are you okay?

1:16:44.221 --> 1:16:45.389
No way.

1:16:53.397 --> 1:16:55.774
- Poison fingers.
- Help!

1:17:04.491 --> 1:17:05.784
Well, that was a bright idea.

1:17:05.826 --> 1:17:07.036
But he's right there.

1:17:07.077 --> 1:17:08.704
- We just grab him!
- Yeah.

1:17:08.746 --> 1:17:10.080
And do what?

1:17:10.164 --> 1:17:11.874
There's no murder weapon.

1:17:11.915 --> 1:17:13.292
The cops will say
it was a heart attack

1:17:13.334 --> 1:17:14.585
just like with Sifu.

1:17:14.626 --> 1:17:16.086
We can't just let him go.

1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:30.768
Need a lift?

1:17:32.353 --> 1:17:34.772
- Was this you?
- It depends.

1:17:34.813 --> 1:17:37.691
Who taught you poison fingers?

1:17:37.733 --> 1:17:38.817
The Three Tigers.

1:17:40.569 --> 1:17:41.653
Took you guys long enough.

1:17:41.737 --> 1:17:44.740
Dai Si-Hing...
just say the word.

1:17:46.950 --> 1:17:48.285
You're Dai Si-Hing.

1:17:56.877 --> 1:17:57.920
Holy shit.

1:17:59.254 --> 1:18:01.131
That's impossible.

1:18:01.173 --> 1:18:03.300
Only one can inherit the clan.

1:18:03.342 --> 1:18:05.469
If all your sons died,
wouldn't you want another one?

1:18:07.054 --> 1:18:09.390
Hey, Sifu told me
you hit him before you left.

1:18:10.641 --> 1:18:11.809
Is that true?

1:18:11.850 --> 1:18:12.810
What's he talking about?

1:18:13.602 --> 1:18:14.728
Did that happen?

1:18:14.770 --> 1:18:17.022
We all broke the old man.

1:18:17.064 --> 1:18:17.981
Some more than others.

1:18:20.693 --> 1:18:22.736
The fiercest tigers can
never share the same mountain.

1:18:24.154 --> 1:18:25.656
Beimo.

1:18:44.299 --> 1:18:46.343
Dammit!

1:18:46.385 --> 1:18:47.678
You're gonna answer the phone?

1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:49.513
Just one second,
I gotta get this.

1:18:49.555 --> 1:18:51.682
It might be an emergency.

1:18:51.724 --> 1:18:53.100
He just called beimo,
man, come on.

1:18:54.351 --> 1:18:55.561
- Caryn?
- Danny,

1:18:55.602 --> 1:18:57.146
did you get my texts?

1:18:57.187 --> 1:18:59.023
Just tell her
you'll call her back.

1:18:59.064 --> 1:19:01.316
I need you to do me
a big, big favor.

1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:04.695
I'm stuck at work and it...
it's not ending anytime soon.

1:19:04.737 --> 1:19:06.113
Can you pick Ed up
from school today?

1:19:06.155 --> 1:19:07.489
Ah...

1:19:07.531 --> 1:19:10.117
I could just pick him up
at your place later, say 8:00?

1:19:10.159 --> 1:19:12.786
You know what, I'm sorry,
I can't right now.

1:19:12.828 --> 1:19:14.121
Now is not a good time.

1:19:14.163 --> 1:19:15.497
- Let's not do this.
- Hey!

1:19:15.539 --> 1:19:16.582
I need you to step...

1:19:16.623 --> 1:19:19.335
He killed Sifu,
what the hell we waiting for?

1:19:19.376 --> 1:19:21.086
If we go at it here,

1:19:21.128 --> 1:19:22.838
we're gonna have to fight off
the cops, too.

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:24.340
Holy shit!

1:19:27.885 --> 1:19:29.720
Ugh.

1:19:29.762 --> 1:19:32.639
Chinatown pier, 10:00.

1:19:32.681 --> 1:19:34.558
This is such bullshit.

1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:36.393
What are we doing?

1:19:36.435 --> 1:19:39.021
So what, we just don't show up?

1:19:39.063 --> 1:19:42.024
He'll think we chickened out,
but he'll move on.

1:19:42.066 --> 1:19:43.108
Like Carter.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:48.655
Guys like this just want
their ego stroked.

1:19:48.697 --> 1:19:52.284
This prick is murdering people
using our Gung Fu.

1:19:53.744 --> 1:19:55.579
When'd you hit the old man?

1:19:56.538 --> 1:19:59.249
It was stupid. I...

1:19:59.291 --> 1:20:01.752
- I just got lucky.
- There's no lucky with Sifu.

1:20:12.096 --> 1:20:14.181
When I told him
about going to Japan.

1:20:15.766 --> 1:20:17.434
He wasn't having it.

1:20:17.476 --> 1:20:19.436
He said a Gung Fu man
should never trade

1:20:19.478 --> 1:20:20.771
in his honor for money.

1:20:22.856 --> 1:20:23.857
And I got mad.

1:20:26.193 --> 1:20:29.029
I said something smart,
he called me a disgrace.

1:20:30.197 --> 1:20:31.990
It got heated and I just...

1:20:35.494 --> 1:20:36.620
I fired on him.

1:20:36.662 --> 1:20:38.163
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

1:20:38.247 --> 1:20:41.792
You... you told me
he gave us his blessing!

1:20:41.834 --> 1:20:44.294
I would have never gone with you
if it was like that.

1:20:44.753 --> 1:20:45.796
Never.

1:20:45.838 --> 1:20:47.798
You never looked back either.

1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:51.010
- What?
- You can make it up now.

1:20:51.051 --> 1:20:52.469
We gotta take ourGung Fu back.

1:20:52.511 --> 1:20:54.930
Dude knows the death touch, man.

1:20:54.972 --> 1:20:56.306
Not even Sifu
could even stop him.

1:20:56.390 --> 1:20:57.599
But at least Sifu tried.

1:20:57.641 --> 1:20:59.810
Look, I got a kid
that needs me, alive.

1:20:59.852 --> 1:21:02.229
Huh! Give me a break, man.

1:21:02.271 --> 1:21:04.023
You ain't winning
no father of the year awards.

1:21:05.899 --> 1:21:07.943
Ah Jim?

1:21:10.112 --> 1:21:11.905
First rule.

1:21:11.947 --> 1:21:14.199
Never get in a ring unless
there's a chance you can win.

1:21:16.243 --> 1:21:18.871
No one here can, so...

1:21:20.122 --> 1:21:21.290
I don't believe this.

1:21:21.332 --> 1:21:23.709
Sifu taught us Gung Fu...

1:21:23.751 --> 1:21:26.128
so that we can become
good righteous men.

1:21:26.170 --> 1:21:29.631
Out there
is a very, very bad man.

1:21:29.673 --> 1:21:34.219
Now we all swore together
that we would defend the weak.

1:21:34.261 --> 1:21:37.181
Your Gung Fu don't mean nothing
without your word.

1:21:37.806 --> 1:21:39.391
Right?

1:21:39.433 --> 1:21:42.102
Dai Si-Hing, my ass.

1:21:42.144 --> 1:21:44.063
Ah Hing, let me take you home.

1:21:44.813 --> 1:21:45.898
Ah Hing.

1:22:02.081 --> 1:22:03.499
- Come on!
- Come on, grind...

1:22:12.466 --> 1:22:13.592
Fight, yeah!

1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:16.553
- Get him, get him!
- Hey!

1:22:16.595 --> 1:22:18.931
Hey, stop!
Hey, just get outta here!

1:22:19.014 --> 1:22:20.182
Get... get outta here!

1:22:20.974 --> 1:22:22.101
You all right?

1:22:22.142 --> 1:22:23.394
Get outta here!

1:22:28.315 --> 1:22:30.776
Whoa, okay, okay, you're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

1:22:30.818 --> 1:22:31.902
Stand up, stand up.

1:22:31.944 --> 1:22:34.530
Let me see.
Let me see your face.

1:22:36.115 --> 1:22:38.367
Oh, it's okay.
Let me get your backpack.

1:22:38.409 --> 1:22:39.410
You all right?

1:22:41.203 --> 1:22:42.579
And who were those kids?

1:22:49.837 --> 1:22:53.799
Next time, don't get in a fight
with a future linebacker, okay?

1:22:54.591 --> 1:22:56.260
That guy was 12?

1:22:56.301 --> 1:22:57.386
Jeez.

1:22:58.721 --> 1:23:00.514
You're lucky it's not broken.

1:23:00.556 --> 1:23:02.307
What happened to your face?

1:23:02.391 --> 1:23:03.600
Oh, what, this?

1:23:05.310 --> 1:23:07.563
I ran into a door.

1:23:07.604 --> 1:23:10.941
You know how I tell you
not to run around the house?

1:23:10.983 --> 1:23:12.401
Well, there's a good reason
for that.

1:23:15.654 --> 1:23:17.906
So...

1:23:17.948 --> 1:23:19.575
how do you think
we should tell your mother?

1:23:20.826 --> 1:23:21.827
Hmm?

1:23:22.953 --> 1:23:25.622
- Do we have to?
- Mm-hm.

1:23:25.664 --> 1:23:26.665
Honor your mother.

1:23:28.083 --> 1:23:30.627
But we told mom
we went to Magic Land.

1:23:32.546 --> 1:23:36.091
Well, this is not the same
as Magic Land.

1:23:36.133 --> 1:23:39.261
And we didn't tell her
'cause it would hurt her.

1:23:39.303 --> 1:23:41.388
- That's what you said, right?
- No, that's not it.

1:23:41.430 --> 1:23:44.641
So I wouldn't get in trouble
and I could see you again?

1:23:45.809 --> 1:23:46.852
That... that...

1:23:47.895 --> 1:23:49.396
This is completely different.

1:23:49.438 --> 1:23:51.190
Besides, that's not what
I was trying to...

1:23:57.237 --> 1:23:58.280
Okay.

1:23:59.823 --> 1:24:01.659
Buddy, we have to tell
your mother about this,

1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:02.785
all right?

1:24:06.497 --> 1:24:08.999
- Is it ever okay to fight?
- No.

1:24:14.338 --> 1:24:15.881
And if it happens to you...

1:24:17.174 --> 1:24:18.384
you gotta go find a teacher.

1:24:19.510 --> 1:24:21.345
What if there is no teacher?

1:24:22.262 --> 1:24:23.806
Then you walk away.

1:24:23.847 --> 1:24:25.391
What if he hits your friend?

1:24:25.432 --> 1:24:26.809
Then you both have to walk away.

1:24:30.270 --> 1:24:31.355
But he...

1:24:34.191 --> 1:24:37.486
Doesn't stop,
calls your friend a faggot,

1:24:38.362 --> 1:24:42.116
and punches him every day.

1:24:42.157 --> 1:24:44.994
Well, that sounds like something
they need to settle

1:24:45.035 --> 1:24:48.831
between themselves
as grown children.

1:24:51.375 --> 1:24:54.420
You said I couldn't learn
any Gung Fu.

1:24:54.461 --> 1:24:57.506
I asked you
and you wouldn't teach me.

1:24:57.548 --> 1:25:00.092
I can't just let them hurt
my friend like that, right, Dad?

1:25:23.198 --> 1:25:26.285
I'm Hing, second disciple
of Sifu Cheung.

1:25:26.327 --> 1:25:27.369
Beimo.

1:25:32.624 --> 1:25:34.251
Hiya!

1:25:34.293 --> 1:25:35.836
Hiya!

1:25:35.878 --> 1:25:37.796
Hiya, hiya!

1:25:37.838 --> 1:25:40.341
Up on this,
up on the fist, good.

1:25:40.382 --> 1:25:42.176
Deeper stance.

1:25:42.217 --> 1:25:45.512
Good, roll the thumb over,
tighter fist, good.

1:25:50.642 --> 1:25:52.102
Oh, my god,
what happened to you?

1:25:52.144 --> 1:25:55.356
Uh, door, wall, something.

1:25:57.232 --> 1:25:58.859
Oh, hang on, hang on, buddy.

1:26:00.694 --> 1:26:02.321
Don't we have something
to tell your mother?

1:26:17.044 --> 1:26:19.254
Always walk away, Ed.

1:26:19.296 --> 1:26:21.799
I don't care who
or what started it.

1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:24.009
Ellsworth is one of the
best schools in the state.

1:26:24.051 --> 1:26:26.345
Your dad and I worked very hard
to get you there.

1:26:26.387 --> 1:26:28.722
We cannot let this ruin
your future.

1:26:28.764 --> 1:26:30.057
No, wait.

1:26:30.099 --> 1:26:32.601
I don't think we should be
that hard on him.

1:26:32.643 --> 1:26:35.688
I mean, he could have lied
to you about it, but he didn't.

1:26:35.729 --> 1:26:37.815
The most important thing
is that he told you the truth.

1:26:38.816 --> 1:26:39.942
Is that so?

1:26:39.983 --> 1:26:41.777
Yeah, I mean,
he's learning self-respect.

1:26:41.819 --> 1:26:43.570
You're nothing
without your word.

1:26:43.612 --> 1:26:45.364
You're nothing
without your word?

1:26:47.825 --> 1:26:52.162
So, um, what did you and Ed
do last weekend?

1:26:53.664 --> 1:26:56.583
Well, he said that you
took him to Magic Land.

1:26:56.625 --> 1:26:59.211
You know, like you said
and... and promised to do.

1:26:59.253 --> 1:27:01.213
Yeah, yeah. We, we...

1:27:02.006 --> 1:27:03.173
We headed out there

1:27:03.215 --> 1:27:05.217
as soon as I picked him up
and, you know,

1:27:05.259 --> 1:27:08.429
we went to grab a few burgers
for the road

1:27:08.470 --> 1:27:09.513
and we just, uh...

1:27:11.598 --> 1:27:12.891
We, uh...

1:27:17.896 --> 1:27:20.149
I had to take care
of something at work.

1:27:21.608 --> 1:27:23.569
It was a big deadline and, uh...

1:27:25.529 --> 1:27:27.990
we didn't make it to Magic Land.

1:27:28.032 --> 1:27:30.784
Then why would Ed say
that you did?

1:27:30.826 --> 1:27:32.911
Because I made him promise
to tell you.

1:27:35.039 --> 1:27:36.206
Ed, I'm...

1:27:38.250 --> 1:27:41.211
That was very selfish of me.

1:27:41.253 --> 1:27:44.631
It's wrong to lie to your mother
and I...

1:27:44.673 --> 1:27:46.383
I shouldn't have made you
do it for me.

1:27:47.885 --> 1:27:49.720
Okay, Ed, get yourself to bed.

1:27:49.762 --> 1:27:51.805
We'll talk about
your punishment tomorrow.

1:27:51.847 --> 1:27:52.890
For defending his friend?

1:27:52.931 --> 1:27:54.975
No, he doesn't deserve
to be punished.

1:27:55.017 --> 1:27:56.101
It's late.

1:27:59.188 --> 1:28:01.398
Yeah, she's right, it's late.

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:02.775
Come on, give me a hug.

1:28:02.816 --> 1:28:05.569
Stop wasting time, go.

1:28:16.497 --> 1:28:17.873
Boy, when you have
the upper hand,

1:28:17.915 --> 1:28:19.124
you really swing, don't you?

1:28:19.166 --> 1:28:21.251
Does everything have to be
a fight with you?

1:28:21.293 --> 1:28:22.628
It's certainly feeling that way.

1:28:33.138 --> 1:28:34.181
Ah Hing?

1:28:35.265 --> 1:28:36.392
Carter, what are you doing?

1:28:38.352 --> 1:28:39.436
What?

1:28:48.487 --> 1:28:50.948
That motherfucker.

1:28:51.031 --> 1:28:53.534
That guy knew what he was doing.

1:29:03.544 --> 1:29:05.587
"Number one before number two."

1:29:09.591 --> 1:29:12.511
See, you're number one
and number...

1:29:14.513 --> 1:29:15.848
Yeah, I got that.

1:29:19.351 --> 1:29:21.061
Please take care of Ah Hing.

1:29:31.196 --> 1:29:32.781
Danny, I, uh...

1:29:32.823 --> 1:29:36.410
Carter, unless you have
the antidote for poison fingers,

1:29:36.452 --> 1:29:39.163
I don't wanna hear
any more fortune cookies.

1:29:41.415 --> 1:29:44.668
When a man's virtue
exceeds his talent...

1:29:47.588 --> 1:29:49.173
he becomes the superior man.

1:30:07.066 --> 1:30:12.529
I swear to always honor
my Sifu...

1:30:12.571 --> 1:30:15.032
- Loyal to my brothers
- Loyal to my brothers

1:30:15.074 --> 1:30:17.534
- and to defend the weak.
- and to defend the weak.

1:30:17.576 --> 1:30:20.537
- This I promise as a disciple
- This I promise as a disciple

1:30:20.579 --> 1:30:22.831
- to the very day I die.
- to the very day I die.

1:30:29.630 --> 1:30:31.382
Danny,
do you know what time it is?

1:30:31.465 --> 1:30:32.883
Where's Ed?

1:30:32.925 --> 1:30:34.968
I wanna talk to him.

1:30:35.010 --> 1:30:37.680
He's sleeping.
What do you think he's doing?

1:30:37.721 --> 1:30:39.014
You never let him say
goodnight to me,

1:30:39.056 --> 1:30:40.933
so I wanna say goodnight to him.

1:30:40.974 --> 1:30:42.142
Are you drunk?

1:30:42.184 --> 1:30:43.769
I screwed up, Caryn.

1:30:43.811 --> 1:30:46.063
I was fooling myself.

1:30:46.105 --> 1:30:50.567
I thought maybe if we did any
less than 50/50 with Ed that...

1:30:50.609 --> 1:30:52.695
that it meant that
I wasn't being a good dad.

1:30:55.030 --> 1:30:57.658
Like I wasn't holding up my end
of the bargain.

1:31:00.202 --> 1:31:01.245
Look, I just...

1:31:02.496 --> 1:31:04.081
I wanted to keep up with you.

1:31:05.290 --> 1:31:06.417
But the truth is,

1:31:08.043 --> 1:31:10.421
you're much better
at being a mom...

1:31:13.257 --> 1:31:14.425
and a father.

1:31:17.344 --> 1:31:19.388
Whatever custody you think
is best,

1:31:19.430 --> 1:31:22.182
if it's 20/80 or...

1:31:25.144 --> 1:31:26.562
Or full custody.

1:31:28.897 --> 1:31:29.898
I'll sign it.

1:31:32.776 --> 1:31:35.821
All I ask is that I get to say
goodnight to my son tonight.

1:31:37.865 --> 1:31:40.451
Two minutes tonight,
tomorrow we talk.

1:31:42.661 --> 1:31:44.913
Ed? Hey, buddy!

1:31:45.831 --> 1:31:46.915
How you doing?

1:31:47.499 --> 1:31:49.668
Good.

1:31:49.710 --> 1:31:52.463
I just wanted to call
to let you know...

1:31:53.297 --> 1:31:54.465
first...

1:31:56.759 --> 1:31:57.968
...goodnight.

1:31:58.010 --> 1:31:59.887
And if I could give you
a hug right now,

1:31:59.928 --> 1:32:01.805
I would give you
the biggest hug.

1:32:01.847 --> 1:32:04.016
And, uh, what I wanted
to say was that

1:32:04.058 --> 1:32:06.101
I'm really proud of you, Ed.

1:32:08.771 --> 1:32:10.647
I'm so glad that you stood up
for your friend.

1:32:12.524 --> 1:32:14.193
That takes real guts.

1:32:15.152 --> 1:32:16.403
And that it's okay.

1:32:18.739 --> 1:32:21.116
If there's no other way out.

1:32:21.158 --> 1:32:24.161
If you have to fight,
that's the right thing to do,

1:32:24.203 --> 1:32:26.372
but don't go looking
for it, okay?

1:32:26.413 --> 1:32:27.539
You understand?

1:32:28.832 --> 1:32:30.376
Because if you go looking
for a fight,

1:32:30.417 --> 1:32:31.543
that makes you the bully.

1:32:33.879 --> 1:32:35.422
I want you to hold up your hand.

1:32:38.133 --> 1:32:39.843
Okay?

1:32:39.885 --> 1:32:42.346
Now I want you to curl
the very tips of your fingers

1:32:42.388 --> 1:32:44.431
and squeeze down

1:32:44.473 --> 1:32:47.267
so that your fingertips
are digging into your palm.

1:32:47.309 --> 1:32:49.978
Squeeze really hard.

1:32:50.020 --> 1:32:53.273
Now put your thumb down
over your fingers.

1:32:53.315 --> 1:32:55.150
No sticking out, okay?

1:32:55.192 --> 1:32:58.028
You can't have your thumb
sticking out or you'll break it.

1:32:58.070 --> 1:33:00.948
Now point it to the light
and look through your hand

1:33:00.989 --> 1:33:02.783
like it's a telescope.

1:33:02.825 --> 1:33:04.576
Can you see through it?

1:33:04.618 --> 1:33:06.537
Any light coming through
your fingers?

1:33:06.578 --> 1:33:08.914
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:33:08.956 --> 1:33:11.458
That means you're not
squeezing hard enough, son.

1:33:11.542 --> 1:33:13.210
You gotta squeeze really hard

1:33:13.252 --> 1:33:15.295
so that there's no more light
coming through the holes.

1:33:16.380 --> 1:33:18.716
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1:33:18.757 --> 1:33:21.093
Okay, that's how
you make a fist.

1:33:21.135 --> 1:33:25.014
From now on, if anyone ever lays
a hand on you,

1:33:26.306 --> 1:33:29.518
touches your mother
or anyone you love,

1:33:31.353 --> 1:33:35.774
son, I want you to squeeze
as hard as you can.

1:33:35.816 --> 1:33:40.154
And you smash that fist
right in their face.

1:33:57.254 --> 1:33:59.798
I'm the senior disciple
of Sifu Cheung.

1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:01.508
Beimo.

1:34:01.550 --> 1:34:03.093
Best of three rounds.

1:34:03.135 --> 1:34:04.386
Three minutes each.

1:34:04.428 --> 1:34:06.263
First round, you attack.

1:34:06.305 --> 1:34:07.389
Second round, I attack.

1:34:07.473 --> 1:34:08.766
Knockout wins it all.

1:34:08.807 --> 1:34:10.684
Suppose you make it
to the third round?

1:34:10.726 --> 1:34:12.478
If you make it
to the third round?

1:34:13.729 --> 1:34:15.314
Free fight.

1:34:15.356 --> 1:34:16.857
Winner throws the loser
off the roof.

1:34:18.025 --> 1:34:21.195
If I win... you both go.

1:34:24.031 --> 1:34:26.075
- Fine.
- What?

1:34:26.116 --> 1:34:27.785
Um, wait a minute.

1:34:29.495 --> 1:34:31.830
I'm not gonna let him
throw us off, that's crazy!

1:34:31.872 --> 1:34:33.624
Let me land first
and I'll cushion your fall.

1:34:35.292 --> 1:34:38.212
Okay, Danny Eight Hands.

1:34:38.253 --> 1:34:41.340
Listen,
round one's gotta be all you.

1:34:41.382 --> 1:34:42.925
Because if we're being honest,

1:34:43.008 --> 1:34:44.218
it's the only chance
you got to hurt him,

1:34:44.259 --> 1:34:46.178
so you gotta hit him
with bad intentions.

1:34:46.220 --> 1:34:47.346
Right.

1:34:47.388 --> 1:34:50.099
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right,

1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:51.975
Ba-ba! Start in on him!

1:34:57.147 --> 1:35:00.192
Yeah, you... you gotta kill him
before he kills you.

1:35:00.234 --> 1:35:01.610
Before he kills us.

1:35:02.611 --> 1:35:03.862
Us.

1:35:07.199 --> 1:35:09.118
You got this.

1:35:11.829 --> 1:35:12.871
You keep time.

1:35:12.913 --> 1:35:14.415
You trust me?

1:35:14.456 --> 1:35:15.582
All family here.

1:35:19.962 --> 1:35:21.255
Y'all ready?

1:35:21.296 --> 1:35:23.090
Go!

1:35:51.118 --> 1:35:53.412
I... I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

1:35:53.454 --> 1:35:55.622
- Uh, it's burning!
- Dude, what ya doing?

1:35:55.664 --> 1:35:56.665
What's the time?

1:35:57.624 --> 1:36:00.669
Uh, man, you're killing it, bro!

1:36:00.711 --> 1:36:01.879
Doing great!

1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:03.464
Just go! Go!

1:36:03.505 --> 1:36:05.674
Danny.

1:36:05.716 --> 1:36:06.884
Go, hurry!

1:36:06.925 --> 1:36:07.926
Shit.

1:36:14.183 --> 1:36:15.726
Oh!

1:36:25.402 --> 1:36:26.779
Oh-hohoho!

1:36:29.198 --> 1:36:31.367
What are you doing again?

1:36:32.451 --> 1:36:34.578
You still got two minutes.

1:36:36.163 --> 1:36:38.040
Danny!

1:36:38.082 --> 1:36:39.208
- Danny!
- Okay.

1:36:39.249 --> 1:36:40.542
Keep fighting, dammit.

1:36:40.584 --> 1:36:42.252
This is your only chance.

1:36:42.336 --> 1:36:43.962
Okay?

1:36:49.009 --> 1:36:51.970
- Okay.
- Let's go, get up!

1:36:52.012 --> 1:36:54.306
- Get up!
- Take... take your time, man.

1:37:17.371 --> 1:37:18.831
Time, time, time!

1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:22.793
One minute break.

1:37:22.835 --> 1:37:24.003
Whose round was that?

1:37:25.879 --> 1:37:27.047
He hit me, right?

1:37:28.632 --> 1:37:30.634
- You can have it.
- Uh!

1:37:32.344 --> 1:37:34.221
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

1:37:40.144 --> 1:37:41.687
I felt something crack.

1:37:41.729 --> 1:37:43.814
Even if I get
to the third round,

1:37:45.024 --> 1:37:46.442
I can't do anything to him.

1:37:46.483 --> 1:37:49.028
I want you to stop worrying
about that. I need you to focus.

1:37:49.069 --> 1:37:50.362
Focus on this second round

1:37:50.404 --> 1:37:51.947
'cause he's gonna bring it
to you now.

1:37:54.199 --> 1:37:55.242
I'm sorry.

1:37:56.452 --> 1:37:57.494
It's okay.

1:37:58.829 --> 1:37:59.997
We're here now, right?

1:38:01.999 --> 1:38:04.001
I can't beat him.

1:38:04.043 --> 1:38:05.836
- I can't beat him.
- Hey!

1:38:05.878 --> 1:38:07.338
If you believe
you're gonna lose,

1:38:07.379 --> 1:38:09.590
then you've already lost.

1:38:09.631 --> 1:38:11.717
I need you to believe
in yourself, okay?

1:38:11.759 --> 1:38:14.720
I need you to believe
you can beat him.

1:38:14.762 --> 1:38:15.804
Now say it.

1:38:16.889 --> 1:38:17.931
- I believe I can beat him.
- No,

1:38:17.973 --> 1:38:19.266
say it like you mean it, Danny.

1:38:21.352 --> 1:38:23.896
- I believe I can beat him.
- Come on.

1:38:23.937 --> 1:38:25.064
I believe I can beat him.

1:38:25.105 --> 1:38:27.941
- Say it! Come on, Danny! Yes.
- I believe! I could beat him.

1:38:27.983 --> 1:38:29.568
- I believe I could beat him.
- Come on now!

1:38:29.610 --> 1:38:30.694
- I believe...
- Let's go!

1:38:37.576 --> 1:38:39.411
- I believe he's gonna kill me.
- Look at me.

1:38:39.453 --> 1:38:42.373
I believe he's gonna stab me
with poison fingers!

1:38:42.414 --> 1:38:44.333
Look at me.

1:38:44.375 --> 1:38:45.501
I have something else.

1:38:45.584 --> 1:38:46.627
I was gonna give it
to you later,

1:38:46.669 --> 1:38:48.837
but I'm gonna give it
to you now.

1:38:48.879 --> 1:38:51.715
They're performance enhancers,
it's gonna boost your power.

1:38:51.757 --> 1:38:53.801
Boost your speed, you're gonna
be throwing bombs, son!

1:38:53.842 --> 1:38:55.719
No, no!
There's no honor in that.

1:38:55.761 --> 1:38:57.179
Do you wanna live
to see your son?

1:38:57.221 --> 1:38:58.681
Not as a coward.

1:38:59.473 --> 1:39:00.557
Fine.

1:39:01.725 --> 1:39:03.352
It's placebo,
I was just playing.

1:39:03.394 --> 1:39:05.312
I was just trying
to get you to believe.

1:39:05.354 --> 1:39:06.397
What are they then?

1:39:06.438 --> 1:39:07.439
Aspirin.

1:39:08.190 --> 1:39:09.358
Oh, hell!

1:39:09.400 --> 1:39:10.943
Give 'em to me.

1:39:12.444 --> 1:39:13.904
- Come on!
- Mm-hm.

1:39:13.946 --> 1:39:16.073
- Mm-hm.
- Let's go get him.

1:39:16.115 --> 1:39:17.658
You got it.

1:39:20.369 --> 1:39:21.412
Y'all ready?

1:39:23.247 --> 1:39:24.331
Go!

1:39:38.595 --> 1:39:40.973
Okay, nice, nice, nice. Nice!

1:39:43.100 --> 1:39:44.685
Stay outside, stay outside!

1:39:50.315 --> 1:39:52.276
Fight like a man,
come here, come on!

1:39:52.317 --> 1:39:53.569
What are you doing? Coward!

1:39:53.610 --> 1:39:55.779
Run!

1:39:55.821 --> 1:39:57.531
Run, you coward, run!

1:40:15.799 --> 1:40:17.426
Time, time, time!

1:40:25.267 --> 1:40:26.560
That was my round.

1:40:34.777 --> 1:40:36.362
All right, man. Whoo.

1:40:38.405 --> 1:40:40.324
I could see him.

1:40:40.366 --> 1:40:41.533
I could see him move.

1:40:42.368 --> 1:40:43.619
I just need to breathe.

1:40:44.286 --> 1:40:46.330
Oh.

1:40:46.413 --> 1:40:47.915
I think he busted my ribs.

1:40:50.709 --> 1:40:53.295
When's the aspirin
gonna kick in, man?

1:40:53.337 --> 1:40:55.005
- You don't feel anything?
- No.

1:40:55.714 --> 1:40:56.715
Nothing?

1:40:59.968 --> 1:41:01.595
Everything I gave you?

1:41:01.679 --> 1:41:03.222
All that was just sugar tablets.

1:41:04.390 --> 1:41:06.475
Yeah, yeah,
we use it to trick fighters

1:41:06.517 --> 1:41:07.685
into cutting weight.

1:41:07.726 --> 1:41:10.437
But it worked
for a little while, right?

1:41:10.479 --> 1:41:12.398
- Power of belief.
- Exactly.

1:41:12.439 --> 1:41:13.524
Okay, focus.

1:41:15.234 --> 1:41:16.402
What you did was good.

1:41:17.528 --> 1:41:19.071
Look,
you're wearing him down.

1:41:19.113 --> 1:41:20.864
You just gotta keep moving
this round, huh?

1:41:22.533 --> 1:41:24.451
My legs are shot.

1:41:24.535 --> 1:41:26.161
If you don't float,
he's gonna sting.

1:41:30.165 --> 1:41:32.459
Don't punk out on me now,
Danny Eight Hands.

1:41:37.006 --> 1:41:38.674
No more time limit!

1:41:42.261 --> 1:41:44.013
Even Sifu
didn't make it this far.

1:41:44.054 --> 1:41:45.180
Shut up and fight.

1:42:46.784 --> 1:42:48.160
Oh, shit.

1:43:21.193 --> 1:43:22.403
Did he get you?

1:43:22.444 --> 1:43:23.487
You okay?

1:43:46.468 --> 1:43:48.012
Oh.

1:43:52.891 --> 1:43:53.976
Yeah!

1:43:54.059 --> 1:43:55.561
Yeah!

1:43:55.602 --> 1:43:57.646
Yeah, Danny Eight Hands!

1:43:57.688 --> 1:43:59.523
The legend continues!

1:43:59.565 --> 1:44:01.358
Easy.

1:44:02.401 --> 1:44:03.736
Easy, Dai Si-Hing, you okay?

1:44:03.819 --> 1:44:05.195
Did he get you?

1:44:12.619 --> 1:44:13.829
So what do we do now?

1:44:26.175 --> 1:44:27.217
What's that again?

1:44:29.136 --> 1:44:32.097
The fiercest tigers can
never share the same mountain.

1:44:34.224 --> 1:44:35.726
Keep your damn mountain.

1:44:44.234 --> 1:44:46.278
911, what's your emergency?

1:44:48.405 --> 1:44:50.574
Caller, I repeat,
what is your emergency?

1:44:52.117 --> 1:44:53.869
Caller, if you're in danger
and can't speak

1:44:53.911 --> 1:44:55.037
just stay on the line, okay?

1:44:55.079 --> 1:44:58.123
We're attempting to trace
your call and send assistance.

1:44:58.165 --> 1:44:59.708
Stay with me as long as you can.

1:45:10.761 --> 1:45:14.348
So, if your guy's good
at stand-up,

1:45:14.390 --> 1:45:16.266
you want to slip, catch.

1:45:16.308 --> 1:45:17.685
Just like that.

1:45:19.311 --> 1:45:20.437
Hmm.

1:45:20.479 --> 1:45:21.563
It's bad.

1:45:22.815 --> 1:45:24.149
Your circulation is bad.

1:45:24.191 --> 1:45:25.609
What was your favorite ride?

1:45:25.651 --> 1:45:26.902
- Mount Splash.
- Still Mount Splash?

1:45:26.944 --> 1:45:28.028
Mm-hm.

1:45:28.070 --> 1:45:31.407
Big smile. Ah!

1:45:31.490 --> 1:45:32.783
Drive that thing.

1:45:32.825 --> 1:45:34.785
- You Asian drivers...
- Yo, I got this, I got this.

1:45:34.827 --> 1:45:36.787
You're late.

1:45:36.829 --> 1:45:38.122
- Sorry about that.
- Sit down, man.

1:45:38.205 --> 1:45:40.040
Hi, Uncle Hing, hi, Uncle Jim.

1:45:40.082 --> 1:45:41.458
What's up, let me see the set.

1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:43.794
Oh, let me feel the power. Bao!

1:45:43.836 --> 1:45:46.046
Ooh! You're working out, I see.

1:45:46.088 --> 1:45:48.132
That's nice,
yeah, Ah Hing?

1:45:48.173 --> 1:45:50.009
I'll get a shaomai
and a chashao.

1:45:52.344 --> 1:45:54.304
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

1:45:54.346 --> 1:45:56.932
Huh? Just go, go, go get out.

1:45:56.974 --> 1:45:59.935
Don't you know who they are?
They're the Three Tigers!

1:45:59.977 --> 1:46:04.231
If you guys are looking for, uh,
you know, a fourth Tiger,

1:46:04.273 --> 1:46:05.441
I take karate.

1:46:05.482 --> 1:46:06.817
Let me know, all right?

1:46:06.859 --> 1:46:09.236
Uh, enjoy the food,
it's on the house.

1:46:09.278 --> 1:46:10.654
- Oh.
- Oh!

1:46:10.696 --> 1:46:12.740
- Yeah.
- Yeah, enjoy.

1:46:12.781 --> 1:46:14.908
Okay. Okay. I'll be out front.

1:46:15.826 --> 1:46:17.911
Three Tigers and the Karate Kid?

1:46:18.370 --> 1:46:19.413
Four?

1:46:19.455 --> 1:46:22.374
How does that feel
to know your daddy is famous?

1:46:25.419 --> 1:46:26.462
- Ready?
- Yep.

1:46:26.503 --> 1:46:28.589
Hands up, hands up. Punch, hoo!

1:46:28.630 --> 1:46:31.342
That way, hoo, huh, hoo, two.

1:46:32.051 --> 1:46:33.052
One, two.

1:46:39.099 --> 1:46:40.100
Foot up.

1:46:43.062 --> 1:46:44.104
Whoa.

1:46:47.941 --> 1:46:49.276
Yeah, all right.

1:46:50.152 --> 1:46:51.570
Ah, mmm!

1:46:51.653 --> 1:46:52.946
Let's do it again!
