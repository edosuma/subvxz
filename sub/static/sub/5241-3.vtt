WEBVTT

00:07.374 --> 00:10.878
Every event we attend,
we build favor equity with Flaherty.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.948
His reach is far beyond basketball,
we wanna tap into that reach.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.187
God has done you, Cam,
and me pretty good.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.923
What we do with the rest
is up to us.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.624
- I'm sorry, are you gonna do something?
- Oh, I'll do something.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.256
I'm saying, don't sit here
and talk about doing something.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.766
- Step the fuck up--
- Cassie: Oh, my God!

00:22.789 --> 00:25.326
Can I just say right out,
I am not gonna press charges?

00:25.358 --> 00:28.066
This is not up to you, Mr. Calloway,
this is a criminal matter.

00:28.094 --> 00:30.267
If the people
will forego prosecution...

00:30.296 --> 00:32.936
I insist on therapy and community
service for Mary Charles

00:32.966 --> 00:34.946
even if they did
start the conversation.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.539
Julius:
♪ Hot cocoa ♪

00:37.570 --> 00:40.847
♪ I'm in love with the hot cocoa ♪

00:40.874 --> 00:43.354
Hey, Uncle J,
can you drop me off at work?

00:43.376 --> 00:45.788
I gotta do highway trash pick up
for my community service.

00:45.812 --> 00:49.225
Hmm, if the judge call you down,
that ain't work.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.525
That's mobile jail.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.326
- You need a ride to jail?
- Yes.

00:53.353 --> 00:55.264
(Julius chuckling)

00:56.289 --> 00:58.269
Mm! Mm!

00:58.291 --> 01:00.794
It is cheat-on-my-diet day.
Here we go.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.467
Let the vittle violations begin,
little brother.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.373
Hot chocolate with caramel ready.

01:05.397 --> 01:08.402
I fasted yesterday so I could fit in
ten pieces of Ma's French toast.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.540
You know, if you did a colonic,
you could get three more.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.311
Mm, but I still gotta go
to practice, though.

01:12.338 --> 01:13.817
- Look, Cam.
- I'd have done it.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.945
This maple syrup right here,

01:15.975 --> 01:20.549
I dug deep, deep, deep down in
the New Hampshire woods for this.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.526
You might be the only Negro
to ever put his lips on this,

01:22.549 --> 01:23.550
I'm telling you that right now.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.426
Hey, I did some cheat day
preparation as well.

01:25.452 --> 01:29.025
Ain't a Negro I know
who don't like circus peanuts.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.796
You need to meet some new Negros.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.100
- Chuck, you the best, baby.
- I know.

01:33.126 --> 01:36.801
Circus peanuts?
Man, it's Cam's cheat-on-his-diet day.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.037
Not Wilt Chamberlain
stick-his-dick-in-everybody day.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.477
Okay, I love both gifts.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.174
- I love you both, thank you.
- Mine more.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.513
- (Cam chuckles)
- Well, let's get into the peanuts.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.848
'Cause I'm sick of waiting on your mama
to make breakfast.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.376
Cam: Nah, fuck this.
Let's wake her up.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.946
Nah, she was out late last night with
that Blair guy from the Portland game.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.458
- What does Blair do anyway?
- No idea.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.654
- Me neither.
- This is my cheat day.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.755
- Let's wake Mom up.
- (banging, shouting upstairs)

01:59.786 --> 02:02.926
- Cassie: Yes!
- I think she might already be up.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.403
Cassie:
My shoe! Fuck that shoe! Oh, God!

02:06.426 --> 02:08.929
- Blair: Oh, yeah! Ooh!
- (Cassie moaning)

02:10.430 --> 02:13.934
What the hell is that?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.447
That is the sound of Blair
fucking our mother.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.608
This motherfucker.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.244
Hence the coinage of the term.

02:21.274 --> 02:24.517
- Last night was their first date.
- (shouting continues)

02:24.544 --> 02:26.217
And it sounds like
it's going pretty good.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.090
You know, who would've thought
that when Mom was choosing her room

02:29.115 --> 02:33.086
we'd be standing here sipping hot cocoa
listening to the sounds of her coming.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.599
I'm gonna throw up.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.932
You was asking what Blair do.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.096
- The answer is your mother.
- (Cam groans)

02:40.126 --> 02:42.868
Okay, you know what?
Take me to mobile jail right now.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.933
(music playing)

02:48.234 --> 02:50.339
(car starts, engine revving)

02:50.370 --> 02:52.441
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, baby, wait.

02:52.472 --> 02:55.316
I'm so sorry.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.083
I'm sorry, baby.
I overslept.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.091
Why don't you be
a little late for practice?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.490
You know, you're the star.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.461
Team lost five of six games that
I missed after M Chuck gouged my eye.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.761
Oh, baby, get out of the past, okay?
We're in the happy present.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.427
You know, you can be a little late
for my French toast.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.766
I'm on good behavior, Ma,
all day, every day.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.902
- Morning, Cam.
- Morning to you.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.434
- Need me to move my car?
- No, uh, I think I can get past it.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.878
- Nice house. Whoo!
- Thanks.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.347
Those wood floors in
your mother's bedroom,

03:24.370 --> 03:27.078
- is that Pergo?
- Would you be so kind

03:27.106 --> 03:30.417
- and brew us some coffee, please?
- Can do.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.286
If you handle the cream and the sugar.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.314
(Cassie giggling)

03:39.152 --> 03:41.792
- He's nice, right?
- Oh, yeah, he's nice.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.300
You know,
you might want to tell him

03:43.323 --> 03:45.030
that people are tucking
their shirts in again.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.766
Well, we're gonna go to
farmers' market later.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.865
I'm a pull some sausages

03:49.896 --> 03:52.968
and some fresh peppers
and some hoagie rolls.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.535
I know you like it, right?

03:54.567 --> 03:56.569
And I'ma cook it all up
for dinner, cool?

03:56.603 --> 03:58.310
I mean, we can eat before 8:00.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.477
- Done.
- All right.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.783
Uh, baby, I wanted to tell you,
I went to see my doctor.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.347
And I'm, um...

04:06.379 --> 04:08.325
Well, it's not fun,
but I'ma need a procedure.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.296
- What? What kind of procedure?
- It's just lady stuff.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.298
You know, you don't even
wanna know the details,

04:14.320 --> 04:16.926
and I don't wanna get into it,
but I'm just a little worried

04:16.956 --> 04:20.494
about the doctor bills and the overages
that our insurance won't pay for.

04:20.526 --> 04:23.029
Yeah, Ma, whatever you need.
Of course, don't-don't sweat that.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.769
You-- you all right, though, right?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.743
Yes, baby, I'm gonna be fine.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.973
It's not a big deal.
Don't you worry about me, okay?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.709
- Okay.
- Look, Cam,

04:30.737 --> 04:32.876
you know I'm always good, right?

04:32.905 --> 04:36.045
Mommy's gonna get much better.
You don't worry about me.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.852
I'm just really appreciative
to have a son like you to help me.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.293
All right, so go ahead,
practice real hard.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.227
- All right.
- And do what you do, baby.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.288
I appreciate you.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.891
(music playing)

04:51.000 --> 04:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:02.368 --> 05:04.507
You gonna put your head
through that wall?

05:04.537 --> 05:06.608
(Reggie chuckling)
I, uh...

05:06.639 --> 05:08.585
just trying to restart my brain.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.554
Been chasing around
the wrong fool.

05:10.576 --> 05:13.819
- This your spillage?
- No.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.588
(sighs) If the average woman
saw the average men's room,

05:16.616 --> 05:18.926
none of us would be allowed
to wear shoes indoors again.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.555
Yeah, I hear you.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.827
How hard is it to deposit urine
in a structure

05:22.855 --> 05:24.596
expressly designed to capture it?

05:24.624 --> 05:28.629
For fuck sake, I could pee an apple off
your head without getting a drop on ya!

05:28.661 --> 05:31.733
I'm gonna say that I believe you,
and that I don't need any proof.

05:31.764 --> 05:35.143
Why can't people just stand still,
lean forward,

05:35.168 --> 05:37.239
and wait till the piss is out of 'em?

05:37.270 --> 05:39.250
- (zipper zips)
- (toilet flushes)

05:39.272 --> 05:41.411
Honestly, I'd rather see
piles of shit on the floor.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.920
At least then I'd know
it was intentional.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.922
(chuckles)
Hey, listen.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.584
Thank you for letting me take that guy
on a tour of the locker room.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.059
Big waste of time, but, you know,
you live and you learn.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.926
Don't sweat Jeff from Burger King.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.124
He's a rite of passage around here.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.326
Says he can deliver the world,
but really all he wants

05:56.356 --> 05:57.733
is free gum and socks.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.431
His business card says
"sports marketing."

06:00.460 --> 06:03.771
Every asshole who gives you
a business card is the wrong asshole.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.969
So how do I meet
the right asshole?

06:05.998 --> 06:08.342
Get your name on their call sheet
and then don't fuck it up.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.944
You can meet my money manager.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.110
His name is Ira Irwin.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.347
Um... okay.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.754
But, Jimmy, you know, Cam and I,
we already got a money manager.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.689
Ira Irwin doesn't manage money.

06:20.713 --> 06:24.183
- Why you call him a money manager?
- Because he's offended by greedy Jew.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.857
And rightly so.
I'll set it up.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.832
No drips.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.926
Thank you, Jimmy.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.267
(music playing)

06:38.998 --> 06:41.706
- What the hell are you doing?
- Mom's got cancer.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.214
- What? What kind?
- I don't know what kind.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.774
The kind that kills people.

06:46.806 --> 06:49.184
Of course she would tell you first,
you're her favorite.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.188
She didn't tell me.
I mean, I think she has cancer.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.680
- You think she has cancer?
- She told me without telling me.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.820
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Mom knows I hate hospitals.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.523
She's probably just trying to protect me
even though she's scared

06:59.552 --> 07:01.463
that our insurance
is not gonna cover it all.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.557
Fucking Reggie.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.864
I knew that he would get
that low-ball shit insurance.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.666
I swear, I think
he wants us all to vanish.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.797
I don't want Mom to die.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.575
Look, if she didn't
give you any details,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.843
- she's gotta have good cancer.
- There is no good cancer.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.406
What the fuck you think
non-Hodgkin's is?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.009
Non-Hodgkin's is bad.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.077
People hit me up on Twitter
every day for non-Hodgkin's.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.784
- It's decimating people.
- Non-Hodgkin's means non-horrible.

07:26.813 --> 07:30.454
- Basically broken arm non cancer.
- I-- I don't think that's right.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.757
I think you're getting confused
by the "non."

07:31.784 --> 07:35.391
No. Non-Hodgkin's is the kind
that gets you GoFundMe money

07:35.421 --> 07:37.901
and everybody's sympathy,
but you're still alive at the end.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.904
And rich!
That's good cancer.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.907
- Now drive off.
- No, Mom's gotta have a bad cancer.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.704
We lived under
that transformer for years.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.971
You know, she probably
doesn't wanna tell us the truth

07:46.999 --> 07:48.945
because she knows that
we're gonna get cancer, too.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.380
- We're all fucked!
- Hey, hey, hey! We do a ton of cardio.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.351
Nobody's getting cancer.
I don't even think Mom has cancer.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.853
If she did,
she wouldn't be so vague.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.787
She'd be milking you for
all you're worth, you know that.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.348
Requesting, complaining,
bitching, moaning.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.259
Basically, if Mom had cancer,
she'd be a cancer.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.229
Well, just call her, will ya?

08:06.252 --> 08:07.390
She said it's some lady stuff.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.457
She's not gonna tell
anyone the truth but a lady.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.138
Kinda love that you
just called me a lady.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.869
(music playing)

08:28.841 --> 08:32.789
Hey. So why do you think Jimmy Flaherty
wants me and you to connect?

08:32.812 --> 08:35.793
He told me you were a money manager.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.852
That fat potato-headed Irish drunk.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.889
- You ever played Mermaid Island?
- No, I have not.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.765
Played it last Thanksgiving
with my niece.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.292
I've been fascinated ever since.

08:46.325 --> 08:50.364
To win, you gotta get these three
mermaids over to Mermaid Island

08:50.396 --> 08:53.639
before the Sea Witch arrives
and builds condos.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.339
I'll Start.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.579
Two.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.483
One, two.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.283
Jimmy knows I don't manage money.

09:04.310 --> 09:07.120
- He's a fucking Mick.
- I think he was just joking.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.625
That's the problem with the Irish.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.650
Either they're always joking
or they're always serious.

09:10.683 --> 09:13.061
And if they're doing both
at the same time,

09:13.085 --> 09:15.031
they never give you any clues
that they're doing it.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.692
So it's very hard to follow.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.168
I don't manage money.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.229
I try and find opportunities
for my friends

09:22.261 --> 09:23.706
to enjoy their lives.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.335
- By making 'em money.
- By making 'em happy

09:26.365 --> 09:29.676
knowing that their money
is busting its ass growing

09:29.702 --> 09:32.273
and expanding
and learning and sharing.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.478
Money's a ridiculous concept.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.509
I mean, I give you a green piece of
paper, you're gonna give me a steak?

09:36.542 --> 09:38.613
That's a weird trade.
You're spin.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.555
Money is a lubricant.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.958
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.552
You want a steak.
I want a house.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.190
I can't trade my steak for
a steak-size piece of your house.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.132
So we use money as a lubricant
to get what we want.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.534
Which is to get off, right?

09:52.558 --> 09:54.128
Right.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.630
I help people's money get off.

09:57.663 --> 10:01.338
I am the mucus of capitalism.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.904
Not the snot, the mucus.

10:03.936 --> 10:08.544
Mucus is a facilitator
for copulation.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.180
I mean, you can do it
without mucus,

10:11.210 --> 10:13.383
but mucus helps
make it more fun.

10:13.412 --> 10:14.857
Almond?

10:24.023 --> 10:26.196
Sea Witch, bummer.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.762
- You're turn.
- Just real quick.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.501
See, I represent Cam Calloway.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.531
And he may be
a pro basketball player,

10:32.565 --> 10:34.602
but we want him to be
more than just a basketball player.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.614
We want his money to get off.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.014
- Want to get it up in that mucus stuff.
- Terrific.

10:39.038 --> 10:42.576
Now, you spin a two, you can get
the pink mermaid across Rainbow Bridge.

10:42.608 --> 10:43.712
Now, there's no pressure.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.222
I mean, it's just
a little girl's game,

10:45.244 --> 10:47.019
but there's a one in three chance
that you can do that.

10:47.046 --> 10:50.255
And to me, hey, 33%,

10:50.282 --> 10:51.818
I think that's good odds.

10:51.851 --> 10:54.263
See, most people think
that capitalism is like chess.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.629
It's a zero-sum game.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.931
You win, I lose.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.370
I don't. True capitalism
is a collective endeavor.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.737
It's Mermaid Island.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.538
You get off, and I get off.

11:06.932 --> 11:10.505
- Why'd you pocket the almonds?
- Your fingernails, they're dirty.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.812
Hmm, you're correct.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.545
My apologies,
I've been messing around with soil.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.884
Lately, the question I've been asking
everybody who sits on that floor--

11:17.910 --> 11:18.980
what kind of mermaid are you?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.957
You the kind of mermaid that's gonna
help the other mermaids

11:20.980 --> 11:23.256
- get back to Mermaid Island?
- Well...

11:23.282 --> 11:25.888
I'm just learning the game,
but, uh, yeah.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.762
I think I got the makings of being
a resourceful mermaid.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.461
Remember the point of Mermaid Island--

11:30.489 --> 11:32.526
nobody wins unless everybody wins.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.334
Of course, the definition of "everybody"
is a select group of people

11:35.361 --> 11:36.806
that guys like me pick.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.934
And how do you decide who you pick?

11:38.964 --> 11:40.637
You ever read
"Johnathon Livingston Seagull"?

11:40.666 --> 11:42.703
No.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.678
Have some almonds.
Have a book.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.948
Give 'em a taste.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.511
Give it a read.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.985
(music playing)

12:01.987 --> 12:05.628
When are you and Reggie gonna start
your new Vaughn generation?

12:05.658 --> 12:09.834
- I'm ready to be an auntie.
- Uh, one of these days...

12:09.862 --> 12:11.273
hopefully.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.243
That was a non-answer answer.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.802
Come on, get to it.
I want a baby around here.

12:15.835 --> 12:19.715
Yeah, I guess I just worry
that I won't be very good at it.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.309
Oh, child, you'll be fine.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.184
You love telling people
when they're wrong.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.555
- M Chuck, how was highway detail?
- Wonderful.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.151
Made some great new friends,
can't wait to do it again.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.525
Listen, stay off the highways.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.053
Apparently there's a lot of white girls
drinking and driving.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.533
Oh, you know what?
I can't wait till you find a corpse.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.763
Some parent out there
will always remember

12:39.792 --> 12:43.137
that you solved the cold case
and gave them closure.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.301
That's the Lord's work,
Mary Charles.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.470
So Cam came to visit me.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.343
Said you need money for lady stuff.

12:49.368 --> 12:50.369
You're getting your titties done,
aren't you?

12:50.402 --> 12:52.905
- I ain't getting no fake titties.
- Hey, I'm not judging.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.815
I wanna help. I've had
more titties in my mouth than you.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.547
Well, I ain't had
no titties in my mouth,

12:56.575 --> 12:58.714
including my fucked-up mother's.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.690
I don't need an upgrade, okay?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.920
- My titties are top-shelf.
- I agree.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.723
- Thank you, Missy.
- You're getting ass implants.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.162
lam not getting anything
implanted, okay?

13:07.186 --> 13:08.995
Well, Cam thinks
that you have cancer.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.399
What?!
I ain't got no cancer.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.096
At least that I know about.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.969
Okay, so what lady stuff
needs work, Ma?

13:15.995 --> 13:18.032
Because Cam is worried.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.241
I'm getting my pocketbook tweaked.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.112
Get the fuck out.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.174
- Cassie!
- Excuse me, language, please.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.742
Okay, bitch, we in public.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.448
Ma, you just said
"fuck, bitch, ass, titties, damn"--

13:31.477 --> 13:33.514
'Cause that's my language, okay?
Those are nouns.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.787
I wish my mother and I were this close.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.421
- Ma, what is wrong with your pussy?
- That's for me to know,

13:38.450 --> 13:41.260
- and for you not to find out.
- I'm just saying I could take a look.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.493
I know pussy better than
you know pussy.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.556
I'll tell you if there's
something wrong with it.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.569
My doctor looked at it and up in it.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.400
And those are two places
that you are not invited.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.030
- And you either.
- I wasn't--

13:49.061 --> 13:50.938
- Your hair says otherwise.
- Look, fine.

13:50.963 --> 13:53.603
Just call Cam and tell him
that you do not have cancer.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.270
He's freaked out.
He thinks that you're dying.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.714
Ain't I, though?
Aren't we all, Ming Lee?

13:58.737 --> 14:01.513
That's why you gotta live for now.
Live for today.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.487
Live your life to the fullest like
it's your last goddamn breath.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.751
If you're gonna make something right,
make the shit right.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.089
That is a beautiful perspective.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.617
Motherhood gives you that perspective.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.529
After being in labor in a bad hospital,

14:14.553 --> 14:18.433
giving birth to kids
fucking your pussy up.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.664
Oh, my God, stop it, Ma.
I was a preemie.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.832
Guaranteed my daddy's dick was bigger
going in than I was coming out.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.139
Your father's not the topic.
Not now, not ever.

14:26.165 --> 14:30.170
Child birth messes your stuff up
like permanently?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.614
Not anymore.
No, no, no.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.016
You know, when life
fucks up your coochie,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.919
medicine has a way of rebuilding it.

14:37.943 --> 14:41.322
- I'ma have a bionic pussy.
- Oh, my God.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.985
Cam's gonna pay for it anyway.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.120
I mean, he's half the reason
why my shit is fucked up.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.494
- And you're the other half.
- You're right, Ma.

14:47.519 --> 14:49.931
Yup, it's time for me to put in
my insurance claim

14:49.955 --> 14:52.595
for my vaginal rejuvenation.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.832
You break it, you buy it.

14:54.860 --> 14:58.103
(music playing)

15:01.800 --> 15:04.406
What the hell is
"vaginal rejuvenation"?

15:04.436 --> 15:07.474
When you shrink-wrap the pussy.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.448
- I'm gonna puke.
- Why'd you Google that?

15:11.477 --> 15:12.854
I wanna know what I'm paying for.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.791
You paying for your mother
to get a smaller, tighter unit.

15:15.814 --> 15:18.454
Right now, she's got a multi-room unit.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.021
She's at the age
when women wanna downsize.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.465
No, Ma really wants this.
Just let her do it.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.629
- (sighs) How does it work?
- I have no idea.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.832
This is supposed to be
your area of expertise.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.467
- I eat pussy, I don't fix it.
- I didn't know fixing was a thing.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.204
Look, Ma said she found
a really great doctor.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.405
Yeah, I heard he was
the Picasso of pussy.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.539
- That's what I heard.
- Picasso is wack.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.709
He painted noses and ear and dicks
coming out of chins and shit.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.583
Imagine if Ma ended up with a clit
right in the middle of her forehead.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.351
Instead of a cyclops, a clit-clops.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.358
(both laughing)

15:48.380 --> 15:51.384
This is our mother's vagina
that we're talking about.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.363
Yeah, the new one.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.331
The old one's about to be put down.

15:55.354 --> 15:59.097
- (laughing)
- Rest in peace to Cassie's pussy.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.071
Look, I'm sure Ma's got
a good doctor, the best.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.439
It don't matter.
Surgery is no joke, okay?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.943
It don't matter how rich you are--

16:06.966 --> 16:10.345
Kanye's mom, Joan Rivers,
they both died during surgery.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.542
You know,
Ma never wanted this before.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.314
And then now after one night with Blair,
she's going to this drastic place.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.322
Who is this Blair dude anyways?

16:18.344 --> 16:21.154
A car dealer who don't like
your mother's pussy.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.423
I'm about to fuck him up for making
Ma feel like her pussy's handicapped.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.727
Okay, okay, nobody can persuade Ma
to do anything she don't wanna do.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.960
- She ain't doing this.
- Oh, my God.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.833
- Man, get that thing out of my face.
- All right?

16:32.858 --> 16:34.895
First glance at side effects-- bad.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.838
Second glance-- horrible.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.466
We gotta expose this stuff to her.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.842
Yeah, we the family expose nothing.
We keep this private.

16:41.867 --> 16:45.474
If this operation could backfire,
it is our job to tell Ma.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.211
We need to have a family discussion.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.014
A man's gotta step up and lead one.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.282
I'm not about to tell my sister
what to do with her pussy.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.449
- That's not a hill I want down.
- Agreed.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.618
No one should tell any woman
what to do with her vadge.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.253
Especially the woman whose vagina
he came out of.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.660
I'm not telling her what to do.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.063
I'm just telling her
what maybe she should not do.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.896
What's the difference?

17:03.922 --> 17:05.299
I don't ask y'all for much, okay?

17:05.324 --> 17:06.894
But when I bring Ma in here
and sit her down,

17:06.925 --> 17:09.804
I expect you both to have my back.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.140
How did I get here?

17:14.165 --> 17:16.237
(music playing)

17:29.748 --> 17:33.321
You look so sexy
when you read books.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.765
And "sexy" to you must be
when I look confused and frustrated,

17:36.789 --> 17:40.100
because that is
what I am right now.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.366
I just took a shower,

17:42.394 --> 17:45.637
put on some of
that lotion you like.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.701
I don't like this book.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.309
Do you have to?

17:54.339 --> 17:58.219
Uh, it was given to me to read
by a rich guy, beyond rich.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.779
There is a reason that he's rich.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.849
Just trying to figure out
if that book is the reason.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.623
Let's do what we like to do.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.723
Instead of talking about
what you don't.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.792
Baby, page 33,

18:11.824 --> 18:14.566
all I got is a seagull
with no friends.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.164
I don't even understand what seagulls
gotta do with business.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.267
So say so when you see him again.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.006
To-- to admit that I don't understand,
that'd be a weakness.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.275
And then, he doesn't even
listen to me when I talk.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.544
Why do you care about
this man's opinion?

18:26.572 --> 18:30.714
(sighs)
I wanna be one of his mermaids.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.423
- You just smoke some weed?
- No.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.585
But maybe if I did,
the book would make sense.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.619
It was written in the '70s.
Writer must've been high.

18:39.651 --> 18:43.531
Reggie Vaughn, you are so cute
when you are trying to solve puzzles.

18:43.555 --> 18:47.367
Stop trying to solve the puzzle.
Just be you.

18:47.392 --> 18:49.463
You see, this book
is some kind of test.

18:49.495 --> 18:53.272
And you don't have to have
the same answers as everyone else.

18:53.298 --> 18:57.041
Just slow down.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.606
Remember the first time
you tried an oyster shooter?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.915
Yeah, gulped it down, gagged.

19:02.941 --> 19:06.252
- Second time...
- Chewed slow, savored it.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.258
- And...
- Best thing I ever ate.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.760
Second best thing.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.860
We're going full reciprocity
tonight, right?

19:17.890 --> 19:21.633
You do your job,
and let me do mine.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.405
All right.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.777
I'm not sitting here listening to this.
I'm your mother.

19:37.809 --> 19:40.312
Cam: Who's about to have
a serious operation.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.519
- Side effects include scarring...
- Bleeding and numbness.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.620
That right there.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.063
- Nerve damage.
- Rectal damage.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.396
That right there.
He wrote that.

19:50.422 --> 19:54.199
- Look, this is vaginal prolapse.
- Julius: Mm.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.832
We don't even know
what vaginal prolapse is,

19:56.862 --> 19:59.502
but that's how serious this is, Ma,
this is very serious.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.670
That's when your vadge
done ran too many laps.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.442
Y'all need to dead this shit,
and dead it right now.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.675
Blair: Got the sausage
and peppers on the grill.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.981
- Anybody need a drink?
- Jack and Coke for me.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.783
- I'll have a Chardonnay, please.
- Do we have any grain alcohol?

20:11.810 --> 20:14.313
- I'll check. Cam?
- I'm good.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.849
I'll be with you in a minute, Blair.
Thank you, baby.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.957
Damn, I thought
Gary Coleman was dead.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.299
Ma, if Blair's making you
feel bad about things

20:26.325 --> 20:28.999
that you shouldn't feel bad about,
then Blair's not the guy for you.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.974
Blair ain't said nothing,
and I ain't tell him nothing.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.704
This is about me, not him.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.839
Is this about you finding things
that we never paid attention to?

20:37.869 --> 20:39.940
Never even cared about
when we were poor?

20:39.972 --> 20:42.680
You don't have to alter the way
God made you to please Blair.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.621
Did you hear what I just said,
or do you need an eardrum rejuvenation?

20:45.644 --> 20:47.453
Please leave Blair out of this.

20:47.479 --> 20:50.153
You know, why don't we make sure
that Blair's left out of this.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.718
- We're gonna go and...
- Yes, please.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.026
...do that.
Excuse me.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.095
I didn't wanna be here.

20:57.122 --> 21:01.366
I-- I just did it
'cause I didn't wanna lose my job.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.737
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm already hurt.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.215
Ma, I'm sorry, but I'm trying
to step up and be a man.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.411
Nobody asked you to be a man.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.976
I asked you to be a son.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.547
A son who understands that
when he was born, I was still a girl.

21:20.579 --> 21:23.788
I've hardly even been with
anybody else since you were born.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.761
And you know what, motherfucker,
that's a long time.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.195
(high-pitched)
I appreciate, you know--

21:27.219 --> 21:30.029
I'm not asking you
for your appreciation.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.501
I'm asking you for some understanding.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.630
Instead of making me feel like
some fucking beggar coming to you

21:35.661 --> 21:38.665
trying to explain my uncomfortable
private fucking matters.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.701
Look, I was a mother

21:41.733 --> 21:44.509
before I ever even thought about
being an adult woman.

21:44.536 --> 21:46.709
And now,
I just wanna have fun

21:46.738 --> 21:49.582
like any other mother
would have the right to have.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.951
When you say "fun," are you--

21:50.976 --> 21:54.014
Yes, I'm talking about sex, Cam.
Yes, I'm talking about sex.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.292
Last night, when Blair and I--

21:59.318 --> 22:01.924
Ma, please, I don't need
no kind of details about that.

22:01.953 --> 22:03.193
Are you shitting me?

22:03.221 --> 22:05.895
Your monkey ass gonna sit here
and embarrass me

22:05.924 --> 22:07.767
in front of my brother and your sister

22:07.793 --> 22:09.966
with all this fucking
intervention bullshit,

22:09.995 --> 22:11.997
and now you don't want me
to open my mouth

22:12.030 --> 22:14.271
and say one motherfucking
goddamn word?

22:14.299 --> 22:16.279
No, no, no.
Shit don't work that way.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.541
You're gonna sit there
and you gonna listen

22:17.569 --> 22:20.140
to every fucking word
I have to say.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.855
After you and your sister was born,

22:26.878 --> 22:30.519
things changed down there
and they never changed back.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.859
Now, I know how it's supposed
to feel down there,

22:32.884 --> 22:34.693
but it doesn't feel the same.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.994
It's not 100%.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.661
I'm in the prime of my fucking life.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.830
I've raised a son who I'm proud of,
who's not living his life,

22:41.860 --> 22:43.703
running around doing his own thing.

22:43.729 --> 22:46.642
And I wanna do my own thing, too.

22:46.665 --> 22:50.010
Listen, Cam, I'm not trying to be
out there like that,

22:50.035 --> 22:52.675
running around, okay?

22:52.704 --> 22:56.675
Just every once in a while,
I wanna go out for a brisk jog.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.915
- And by "brisk jog"...
- Yes, baby.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.015
Mommy's talking about sex.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.001
You see your hoodie right there?

23:16.995 --> 23:20.135
Right now, I'm like this.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.842
After the operation,
I'll be like this.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.642
- Yeah, that's pretty tight.
- Yeah.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.912
I got you, Ma, I'm... I'm sorry.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.920
Can we please
never talk about this again?

23:38.016 --> 23:40.724
- You started it.
- Yes, I did.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.528
Yeah, you did.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.592
(Cassie sighs)

23:47.893 --> 23:50.032
I need a fucking drink.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.541
- Julius!
- Julius: What?

23:52.564 --> 23:56.307
(music playing)

24:01.573 --> 24:03.519
ls she all right?

24:03.542 --> 24:06.216
She had open-pussy surgery,
not open-heart.

24:06.244 --> 24:10.420
Hey, Ma. Hey.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.224
How you doing?

24:12.250 --> 24:16.926
(slurring)
I'm high in the head,

24:16.955 --> 24:20.835
but I'm really numb down south.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.237
All right, let's--
let's ease up on the questions.

24:23.261 --> 24:26.071
- I've had enough honesty for a while.
- Be sensitive.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.907
- Fuck--
- Get well.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.538
That's my brother.

24:30.569 --> 24:33.743
Yeah, they didn't have any that said,
"Happy new cooch day."

24:33.772 --> 24:37.151
(slurring) I know I'm supposed to be
feeling bad right now,

24:37.175 --> 24:42.420
but them drugs they gave me
was some killer shit.

24:42.447 --> 24:46.156
I don't feel a goddamn thing.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.960
Oh... baby...

24:48.987 --> 24:51.524
- can you do me a big favor?
- Sure, anything.

24:51.556 --> 24:54.867
Could you, um,

24:54.893 --> 24:56.873
could you tell me
how it looks down there?

24:56.895 --> 24:58.932
Oh!

24:59.931 --> 25:02.104
This family's getting too close.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.441
Sure, Ma.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.422
- (weakly) ls it good?
- It's good.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.754
(Cassie groans)

25:14.779 --> 25:17.385
Actually, uh...

25:17.415 --> 25:19.053
