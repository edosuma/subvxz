42:30.040 --> 42:32.508
THEY ALL CALL YOU MARY SIBLEY.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.744
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL YOU

42:33.780 --> 42:37.511
IN MY HEAD, TO MYSELF,
IN MY HEART?

42:37.550 --> 42:39.086
"MAGIC MARY."

42:39.120 --> 42:42.351
YOU WERE ALWAYS MAGIC,

42:42.390 --> 42:45.450
EVEN BACK
WHEN WE WAS JUST SPROUTS.

42:45.490 --> 42:47.219
AND YOU COULD DO ANYTHING --

42:47.260 --> 42:49.728
ALWAYS COULD.

42:49.760 --> 42:52.228
YOU JUST HAVE TO
WANT IT BAD ENOUGH.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.919
AND YOU DO.

42:53.970 --> 42:56.894
DON'T YOU?

42:56.940 --> 42:59.932
YOU DO WANT JOHN ALDEN TO LIVE.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.530
John:
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

43:31.840 --> 43:34.604
Mary:
THEY WILL HANG YOU TOMORROW.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.904
John: "TH EY"?

43:36.940 --> 43:39.704
WELL, AREN'T YOU ONE OF THEM,
MRS. SIBLEY?

43:43.520 --> 43:46.284
Mary: SOMETIMES,
I NO LONGER REMEMBER WHO I AM.

43:46.320 --> 43:49.448
BUT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE --

43:49.490 --> 43:52.027
AN INNOCENT MAN.

43:52.060 --> 43:55.029
John: [ CHUCKLES ]
HARDLY.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.290
NOW IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

43:57.330 --> 44:00.868
SALEM FINALLY SENTENCED
SOMEONE TO DIE

44:00.900 --> 44:03.198
FOR SOMETHING
TH EY'VE ACTUALLY DONE.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.334
GO HOME, MARY.

44:06.370 --> 44:09.635
GO BACK TO YOUR LIFE,
MRS. SIBLEY.

44:12.310 --> 44:14.141
Mary:
YOU ARE MY LIFE.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.138
John: WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT THOUGHT.

44:20.190 --> 44:21.680
Mary:
I'LL NOT LET YOU HANG.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.351
I CAN SAVE YOU.

44:24.390 --> 44:25.687
John:
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SALEM,

44:25.730 --> 44:29.222
THE PEOPLE
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE,

44:29.260 --> 44:31.820
THEY ALL WANT ME DEAD.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.668
THEY THINK
I'M THE DEVIL HIMSELF.

44:36.170 --> 44:38.092
I'M NO DEVIL.

44:41.740 --> 44:45.244
BUT I AM GUILTY OF TREASON...

44:45.280 --> 44:46.907
AND MURDER.

44:48.680 --> 44:51.615
AND I'M READY TO HANG FOR IT.

44:53.220 --> 44:55.313
BESIDES...

44:55.360 --> 44:57.851
I'M AWFULLY TIRED.

44:59.260 --> 45:01.228
TIRED OF LIVING WITHOUT YOU.

45:01.260 --> 45:04.491
Mary: THERE'S STILL A WAY
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

45:04.530 --> 45:05.690
John: IT'S OVER.

45:05.730 --> 45:07.163
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

45:07.200 --> 45:09.191
HAVE YOU GONE MAD
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS TOWN?

45:09.240 --> 45:12.107
Mary:
JOHN, I PROMISE YOU --

45:12.140 --> 45:13.937
John: NO, DON'T.

45:13.970 --> 45:17.770
NEITHER OF US IS VERY GOOD
WITH PROMISES, SO NO MORE VOWS.

45:17.810 --> 45:19.243
Mary: LISTEN TO ME.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.941
John:
I AM LISTENING TO YOU,

45:20.980 --> 45:23.915
AND YOU AREN'T MAKING ANY SENSE.

45:23.950 --> 45:26.282
LOOK AROUND YOU.

45:26.320 --> 45:30.359
THESE ARE STONE WALLS.
[ SCOFFS ]

45:30.390 --> 45:32.221
[ GATE RATTLES ]
BARRED WINDOWS,

45:32.260 --> 45:33.727
AN IRON DOOR.

45:33.760 --> 45:39.460
RIGHT ABOVE US,
A THICK ROPE AWAITING MY NECK.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.866
THOSE ARE THE STUBBORN FACTS.

45:41.900 --> 45:44.095
AND ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD

45:44.140 --> 45:46.438
CAN'T CHANGE
A SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

45:46.470 --> 45:48.062
Mary: YOU'RE WRONG.

45:48.110 --> 45:52.149
LOVE IS STRONGER THAN FACT,
STRONGER THAN EVERYTHING.

45:54.250 --> 45:56.070
BUT I TELL YOU, JOHN,

45:56.120 --> 45:59.248
THERE IS STILL A PLACE FOR US
IN THIS WORLD.

45:59.290 --> 46:02.054
John: ONLY IN DREAMS.

46:02.090 --> 46:05.389
Mary: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

46:05.430 --> 46:08.581
ONE LAST TIME...

46:08.630 --> 46:10.495
DREAM WITH ME.
