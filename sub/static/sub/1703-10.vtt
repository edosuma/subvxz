<i>Air and naval forces</i>
<i>of the United States...</i>

00:05.372 --> 00:08.034
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities-</i>

00:08.108 --> 00:10.941
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.741
<i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror in Africa,</i>
<i>Europe and the Middle East.</i>

00:13.813 --> 00:17.112
This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.083
<i>...his relentless pursuit of terror.</i>

00:19.152 --> 00:22.883
<i>- We will make no distinction-</i>
<i>- The U.S.S.</i> Cole
<i>was attacked while refueling-</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.821
This was an act of terrorism.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.325
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.886
The next number we're gonna play for you
is one of the good ol' favorites.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.432
...until something stops him.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.264
<i>I-I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:38.405 --> 00:41.033
<i>We got a plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:42.409 --> 00:43.967
<i>...thousands of people running-</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.342
We must, and we will...

00:46.413 --> 00:47.971
remain vigilant at home and abroad.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.514
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:57.824 --> 01:00.019
<i>Fuckl I missed something once before.</i>

01:00.093 --> 01:03.119
<i>I won't- I can't let that happen again.</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:07.959
<i>It was 10 years ago.</i>
<i>Everyone missed something that day.</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:10.696
<i>Yeah, everyone is not me.</i>

01:10.770 --> 01:12.032
<i>Once you've gotten to this position.</i>

01:20.380 --> 01:22.814
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.750
You're telling me the fucking C.I.A.
Thinks I'm working for Al-Qaeda?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.220
<i>I think you're working for Al-Qaeda.</i>

01:29.289 --> 01:30.847
We were wrong about Brody.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.349
Wait. I-I was wrong.

01:34.427 --> 01:38.056
This weekend, this time
that we spent together- it <i>was</i> real.

01:38.131 --> 01:40.531
Hey, Carrie. Fuck you.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.235
<i>I pray every day...</i>

01:47.307 --> 01:51.175
<i>that you never lose sight of what you</i>
<i>committed to do in Issa's name.</i>

01:51.244 --> 01:54.645
This is Issa, my son.
I want him to learn English.

01:54.714 --> 01:57.706
"The house must be strong
to keep them safe."

01:57.784 --> 02:00.150
It's truly excellent.

02:02.088 --> 02:03.783
<i>A drone missile hit and destroyed...</i>

02:03.857 --> 02:05.984
<i>part of a compound</i>
<i>in the mountains of northern Iraq.</i>

02:06.059 --> 02:10.051
<i>The images being broadcast</i>
<i>of the bodies of 83 dead children...</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:13.395
<i>allegedly killed in the strike,</i>
<i>we believe to be false...</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:15.991
<i>created by the terrorists</i>
<i>for propaganda purposes.</i>

02:16.069 --> 02:20.768
The vice president, the man most
instrumental in the drone attack
that killed young Issa...

02:20.840 --> 02:23.570
is going to ask you
to run for political office.

02:23.643 --> 02:26.874
Say yes.
That will be a signal to Nazir...

02:26.946 --> 02:29.244
that you are
still committed to do this.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.751
Aileen just I.D.'d Tom Walker.
He's the terrorist.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.879
Tom was dead. That's what they told me.

02:35.955 --> 02:39.288
<i>What we need to do is find him</i>
<i>before anything happens.</i>

02:41.261 --> 02:43.923
Walker? He meets
with a man to do business.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.057
He drives a car
with the diplomatic plates.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.863
That's it on the left,
home of our Saudi diplomat.

02:49.936 --> 02:52.734
What if Mr. Zahrani
doesn't give us anything anytime soon?

02:52.805 --> 02:56.434
We figure out an elegant way
to lift and interrogate him.

<i>What do we know? Very little, that's what.</i>

03:13.326 --> 03:16.295
<i>But in our line of work,</i>
<i>sometimes very little is just enough.</i>

03:16.362 --> 03:18.330
<i>Take Mansour al-Zahrani.</i>

03:18.398 --> 03:20.798
Mild-mannered second secretary
of the Saudi embassy...

03:20.867 --> 03:22.596
seen here goin' to work three days ago.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.263
We surveilled him 24-7.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.569
We listened to every phone call
he's made in the last week.

03:28.641 --> 03:33.635
We pawed through his professional life,
his financial life, his personal life.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.581
In short, we turned him upside down. We shook
real hard. Two items of interest fell out.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.345
Item one-

03:39.419 --> 03:43.253
Al-Zahrani is in debt
to the tune of about $750,000...

03:43.323 --> 03:45.757
all due to investments
even I'd know better than to make.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.019
Item two-

03:48.027 --> 03:50.791
Al-Zahrani is gay.

03:50.863 --> 03:53.195
He's got three wives, 10 children.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.461
He's a devout and conscientious Muslim.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.333
Yet every Thursday, when everyone thinks
he's out jogging in Rock Creek Park...

03:58.404 --> 04:01.373
he's, in fact,
visiting this bathhouse off Dupont Circle.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.944
We managed to get inside
during his most recent visit.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.584
As you can see, he's a naughty boy.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.260
I believe that item one
and item two will get us what we want...

04:27.333 --> 04:30.200
which is for this son of a bitch to tell
us where Tom Walker is...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.204
and what he and Abu Nazir are plotting.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.834
<i>Most of al-Zahrani's debt is carried by a
<i>private equity bank called Market Security.</i></i>

04:36.909 --> 04:39.571
<i>As I said, we don't have much,</i>
<i>but we definitely have somethin'.</i>

04:56.763 --> 04:59.095
- William Pritchard.
- That's me.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.895
I'm Carrie Mathison.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.459
You're really a spy?

05:04.537 --> 05:07.506
Uh- An intelligence officer, actually.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.598
This is cool.
Can I tell my wife about this?

05:09.676 --> 05:11.166
No.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.542
Even cooler.

05:13.613 --> 05:17.276
As I mentioned on the phone, we're interested
in one of your clients- Mansour al-Zahrani.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.615
Yeah, I pulled his file.
Makes dismal reading.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.882
How'd you like to cause him some pain?

05:22.955 --> 05:27.324
I'd rather have the money he owes us but,
short of that, pain might be satisfying.

05:27.393 --> 05:31.591
- What can I do?
- We'd like to borrow your bank.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.222
You sure I can't tell my wife?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.669
- Sergeant Brody?
- Yes.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.503
We need to check your house, sir.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.908
- What the fuck?
- We're Secret Service, sir.

07:06.025 --> 07:09.859
Sergeant Brody, sorry for the intrusion.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.092
Everyone's a little on edge
because of your sniper buddy, I'm afraid.

07:14.901 --> 07:18.234
I have to ask.
Is Walker as good a shot as they say he is?

07:19.839 --> 07:22.967
- Yes, he is.
- Too bad for us.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.067
Clear the room.

07:29.248 --> 07:32.911
I'm very impressed with the way you've
handled coming back to the real world.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.714
Thank you, sir.

07:34.787 --> 07:37.483
Representative Richard Johnson-
mean anything to you?

07:38.090 --> 07:39.853
I watch the news.

07:39.926 --> 07:43.987
How would you feel about running for his
seat in the upcoming special election?

07:45.998 --> 07:50.765
I would consider it an honor to work with a
man who's actually fought the War on Terror...

07:50.837 --> 07:54.068
who's lived among the enemy
and understands 'em.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.438
What do you think? You interested?

08:04.784 --> 08:08.185
Yeah. I'm interested.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.154
Good news, good news.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.391
I need to talk to my wife first.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.123
- Is that a problem?
- To be honest, it could be.

08:18.197 --> 08:21.564
Well, we need her on board.
She's half the story.

08:21.634 --> 08:26.230
War hero returns home after eight years'
imprisonment to his beautiful, loving wife.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.535
I'm sure you'll be able to convince her.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.614
On the move.

08:45.057 --> 08:48.390
Al-Zahrani's got diplomatic immunity.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.395
That may not mean much to you people...

08:50.463 --> 08:53.899
but to us mere mortals in the State
Department, that's a serious issue.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.729
We're not draggin' him to Tunisia.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.361
We're not waterboarding.
We'll be very polite and gentle.

08:58.437 --> 09:01.133
I just want to ask him
some questions during his lunch hour.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.438
C.I.A.'s not even supposed
to be operating on American soil.

09:04.510 --> 09:07.138
It's against your own charter.
This is the F.B.I.'s job.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.740
Al-Zahrani's running a terrorist cell
out of the Saudi embassy.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.512
He and Tom Walker are planning an attack
on the United States.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.986
Fuck the charter.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.853
- He doesn't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.189
You don't know if this thing will work.
You grab the guy-

09:21.260 --> 09:25.458
- Entice.
- You entice the guy into
the bank, and then what?

09:25.531 --> 09:28.125
- You've got a couple of hours maybe.
- We figure two at the outside.

09:28.200 --> 09:33.502
You have two measly hours before
the Saudi embassy starts missing
him. What if he doesn't turn?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.133
Being gay in Saudi Arabia
is like being the Antichrist here.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.972
I am aware of our cultural
differences with Saudi Arabia.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.037
If al-Zahrani doesn't turn
and we blow the whistle on him...

09:42.114 --> 09:43.672
he can look forward to losin' everything.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.650
- I mean everything.
- I see no compelling reason not to do this.

09:46.719 --> 09:50.177
Were you not listening?
I just gave you 10 of them.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.487
I'm going to the secretary
on this one, David.

09:53.559 --> 09:57.325
And I will be appending all of my
objections right on the fucking order.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.125
Append away.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.636
Carrie, I want you
to run the interrogation.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.529
Shouldn't it be Saul?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.940
Al-Zahrani will be thrown if it's a woman.
Might give us some leverage.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.500
David's right.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.678
Everything we know
about al-Zahrani's in here.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.348
Are you sure you're okay
with my doing this?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.084
You're the right person for the job.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.052
Saul.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.654
I'm fine.

10:36.202 --> 10:39.501
Remember what you said to me way back
about getting the truth out of these guys?

10:39.572 --> 10:42.598
- What?
- You're trying to find
what makes them human...

10:42.675 --> 10:45.007
not what makes them terrorists.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.506
Sounds like good advice.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.609
Better get started.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.037
Oh, Jesus. You scared me.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.808
Sorry. Kids get to school okay?

11:22.882 --> 11:24.440
Yeah, with the usual hysterics.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.453
Chris is convinced he's the worst athlete
in the entire eighth grade...

11:28.521 --> 11:32.321
and Dana's convinced she's a lesbian
'cause boys disgust her.

11:34.493 --> 11:37.621
What's going on?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.433
While you were gone, I had a visitor.

11:42.501 --> 11:46.062
- Who?
- Vice president of the United States.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.800
In our house?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.570
- It's a mess.
- I doubt he noticed.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.035
What did he want?

11:54.113 --> 11:55.603
You remember Congressman Johnson?

11:55.681 --> 11:58.775
That poor bastard we saw
on the TV at Gaines's house?

11:58.851 --> 12:02.617
He's resigning,
and they want me to run for his seat.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.657
I knew it. You said no, right?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.659
I said I'd talk it over with you first.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.696
You're actually considering it?
You can't be serious.

12:10.763 --> 12:14.460
Well, what else am I gonna do? Hell, stay
in the corps and go back to Iraq?

12:14.533 --> 12:16.364
Brody, we're just getting
our lives back on track.

12:16.435 --> 12:20.872
We're just getting our marriage back on
track. And you want to go into politics?

12:20.940 --> 12:23.408
We'll never see you. It'll be like you're
leaving us all over again.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.570
- I'll carve out plenty of time
for you and the kids.
- No. Absolutely not.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.203
You cannot do this.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.175
I think I can make a difference.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.446
Do you want our family to be
dragged through the mud...

12:34.520 --> 12:36.784
by every newspaper
and cable news channel in the country?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.791
Because that's what's gonna happen.
They're gonna dig for dirt until they find it.

12:39.859 --> 12:44.023
- You don't know that.
- Me and Mike. You and that
C.I.A. Lady you fucked.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.628
Don't be naive.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.073
It'll all come out,
every last gory detail.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.176
I have to go change.

13:02.248 --> 13:06.082
I seem to have become one of those women
who takes her kids to school in her pajamas.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.288
- Wives.
- Three.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.092
Zahra, Hala and Yasmeen.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.896
He met Zahra when they were both 15.
An arranged marriage, of course.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.765
He had his
first five children with her.

13:24.837 --> 13:29.331
Um-

13:29.408 --> 13:31.933
Farid, Suhail...

13:32.011 --> 13:34.275
Gamila, Huda and Wadiya.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.211
How can someone be 15 and married?

13:36.282 --> 13:38.682
What could a 15-year-old possibly know...

13:38.751 --> 13:42.243
about the intricacies of a relationship,
about taking care of a family?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.846
- More than you do?
- Oh!

13:50.963 --> 13:52.863
Mathison.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.526
Hey. It's me, Brody.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.800
- <i>You there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.863
I need to see you.

14:04.476 --> 14:08.139
- Why?
- <i>It's personal.</i>

14:08.214 --> 14:10.546
- Uh, when?
- Now.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.778
I-I can't.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.254
- H-How about tomorrow night?
<i>- What's wrong with tonight?</i>

14:17.323 --> 14:20.781
- I'm working.
- Yeah, she's working.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.887
- Who's that?
- <i>Uh, nobody. It's a- a neighbor.</i>

14:27.166 --> 14:28.963
You sure you can't make it tonight?

14:29.034 --> 14:32.231
- Yeah, I'm sure. Sorry.
- <i>Okay.</i>

14:32.304 --> 14:35.239
Tomorrow. When and where?

14:35.307 --> 14:37.901
We could go to that bar.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.468
Why don't I just come to your place?

14:42.448 --> 14:45.713
Oh, okay. Uh, sure.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.309
7:00? I'll text you the address.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.356
<i>Okay, great. See you then.</i>

14:53.792 --> 14:55.316
Hot date?

14:57.263 --> 15:01.757
- Hardly.
- So you're texting
your address to a plumber?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.394
It's none of your fucking
business who I'm texting my address to.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.262
So you think we have enough?

15:08.340 --> 15:10.808
You think al-Zahrani will turn?

15:10.876 --> 15:13.140
Well, you know as well as I do-

15:13.212 --> 15:15.680
There's guys who roll over
and beg for mercy...

15:15.748 --> 15:18.512
and then there's those other guys
who get all heroic...

15:18.584 --> 15:20.745
and are willing to die for the cause.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.412
He's here.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.549
You good?

15:57.222 --> 16:01.022
- Eye contact, please.
- I'm good.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.118
Good.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.561
It's good that you're good.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.622
Good is a good thing.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.358
Carrie.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.874
Eviscerate the motherfucker.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.596
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.299
They told me I might find you in here.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.707
- Workin' on your jump shot?
- Somethin' like that.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.977
- How's the jaw?
- Fine.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.110
I'm sorry, dude. I was way out of line.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.752
No, no. I deserved it.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.727
What do you want, Brody?

17:16.568 --> 17:20.299
I'm telling you, man,
this whole coming home thing is tough.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.239
- I hear you.
- I'm either parading around
like a toy soldier...

17:23.308 --> 17:26.277
or doing the fuckin' laundry.

17:26.345 --> 17:29.143
I need to be of service.
I need to do somethin' that matters.

17:31.650 --> 17:35.484
I've been asked by Vice President Walden
to run for Congress.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.545
- You fuckin' serious?
- Yeah.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.953
Jess doesn't want me to do it.

17:42.027 --> 17:45.087
- She's exercising her veto rights.
- Why?

17:45.164 --> 17:48.133
I think she's afraid
of being in the limelight.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.171
You wanna do it?

17:58.110 --> 18:00.544
I gotta do somethin'.

18:00.612 --> 18:04.446
Either that or I keep being
pulled back into fuckin' Iraq.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.312
It's messing with my family.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.118
I get these moods.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.849
I'm no fun to be around.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.258
Hey, Mikey, you and, uh-

18:24.736 --> 18:27.000
You and Jessica-

18:30.843 --> 18:33.903
You didn't do anything wrong.

18:36.915 --> 18:40.715
And I can't blame you
for whatever happened.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.980
You thought I was dead.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.890
And I know you guys got close.

18:51.763 --> 18:55.494
And I'm sure it's not easy
for you to say good-bye to each other.

18:58.337 --> 19:04.242
And, um, this whole situation
is entirely fucked up. Ah.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.009
Talk to Jessica.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.247
Tell her how much this means to me.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.255
I gotta get my family back together.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.694
And, um-
she'll listen to you.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.401
Thanks.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.213
Hey, somethin' else.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.491
You took care of my kids.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.955
I'll always be grateful.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.621
Right this way.
We'll get it all sorted out.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.251
Mansour al-Zahrani,
I'd like to introduce you...

20:28.327 --> 20:31.524
to Eli Soodik and Carol Sweetzer,
my top loan officers.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.088
They'll lay out the details
of your debt restructuring.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.828
I'll leave you to it. Uh,
I'm around if you need me.

20:39.238 --> 20:43.106
Security. It's an unfortunate
necessity these days.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.006
Security for what?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.807
It's not like you're going
to hand me cash after all.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.409
Please, sit down. Let's begin.

20:50.482 --> 20:53.315
We have some questions we'd like
to ask you. We don't have much time.

20:53.385 --> 20:56.479
We need to get you back to your embassy
by the end of lunch hour.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.785
You're not loan officers. Who are you?

21:00.759 --> 21:04.160
- I would like to leave now.
- I-I'm afraid we can't allow that.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.190
You're C.I.A.? F.B.I.?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.897
Whoever you are, you can't hold me.
I am a Saudi diplomat.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.269
I have diplomatic protection.

21:15.340 --> 21:20.039
You know what?
I'm going to call my embassy right now.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.080
This is outrageous. I will not allow it.

21:22.147 --> 21:26.675
My ambassador will go straight to the
White House, and you will both lose your jobs.

21:26.752 --> 21:29.084
Why don't you take a look
at these photographs.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.816
Then you can call anyone you want.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.241
Here.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.117
I will not betray my country.

22:07.192 --> 22:09.888
Of course not.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.020
Sit down, please.

22:22.941 --> 22:27.401
You owe Market Security $750,000.

22:27.479 --> 22:31.882
Your salary at the Saudi embassy
is $170,000 a year.

22:31.950 --> 22:35.477
You've sold all of your stocks in the past
three years. You have no savings.

22:35.554 --> 22:38.250
You have no other real estate holdings.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.416
Is that a fair summation?

22:40.492 --> 22:42.016
Your point?

22:43.395 --> 22:46.228
You're spending more than you make.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.493
- Substantially.
- Is that a crime?

22:48.567 --> 22:51.263
No, not in and of itself.
But it is curious to note...

22:51.336 --> 22:54.703
that you are somehow meeting all of your
financial obligations.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.142
What's in Geneva?

23:04.683 --> 23:06.844
Cuckoo clocks.

23:06.918 --> 23:10.251
Why have you traveled there
six times in the past year?

23:10.322 --> 23:12.688
It's business for my government.

23:12.758 --> 23:17.127
Well, our friends in Switzerland inform us
that on the morning of last Saturday...

23:17.195 --> 23:21.529
you had breakfast at the Beau-Rivage Hotel
with a man named Faraz Sabbaq.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.162
He handed you an envelope.

23:25.237 --> 23:30.038
You then carried this envelope to the
Clariden Leu bank on Rue François-Versonnex.

23:30.108 --> 23:34.442
Twenty minutes later, you exited the
Clariden Leu bank without the envelope.

23:34.513 --> 23:37.141
You should know that Swiss officials
had their eyes on Sabbaq...

23:37.215 --> 23:42.050
and then you, of course, because
he's a trusted courier for Abu Nazir.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.785
I don't know Abu Nazir.

23:45.857 --> 23:49.691
Abu Nazir gives money to Sabbaq.
Sabbaq hands money to you.

23:49.761 --> 23:53.629
You deposit the money in a Swiss bank
and use it to pay off your bills.

23:55.033 --> 23:58.025
Why lose everything for a cause
you don't even believe in?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.594
You're obviously not a zealot.

24:00.672 --> 24:03.835
You don't believe in radical Islam.
You love the West.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.712
No more questions.
I am done talking to both of you.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.340
Do you really want me to share
these photos with your wives...

24:11.416 --> 24:15.409
your children, your parents,
your ambassador?

24:25.730 --> 24:29.723
Go ahead. Tell everyone you want.
Tell them all. I don't care.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.032
I suck cock, and I love it.

24:33.104 --> 24:34.628
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

24:35.841 --> 24:38.401
My wives already know. They don't care.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.607
They love me.
So fuck it, huh? And fuck you.

24:42.681 --> 24:46.276
Put me on CNN. I'll admit to everything.

24:49.921 --> 24:53.084
Now I would like
to go back to my embassy.

24:56.595 --> 24:59.257
- Sit the fuck down! I'm not finished!
- Oh, I think you are.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.196
Mr. Al-Zahrani, I'd like to remind you-

25:01.266 --> 25:04.064
You love your children
very much, don't you?

25:17.148 --> 25:19.309
Do you have a favorite?

25:19.384 --> 25:21.147
No, of course not.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.549
I think Janine is your favorite.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.287
She is a very remarkable young woman...

25:29.361 --> 25:32.159
but all of my children are remarkable.

25:32.230 --> 25:36.758
Not one of your other children is a sophomore
at Yale, majoring in political philosophy.

25:36.835 --> 25:39.963
Not one of your other children
was a National Merit Scholar.

25:40.038 --> 25:44.407
Not <i>one</i> of your other children has spent
two full days with you at the Phillips gallery...

25:44.476 --> 25:48.003
happily looking
at your beloved impressionists.

25:48.079 --> 25:51.105
We would deport her.

25:51.182 --> 25:55.175
And we would make sure that she was not
welcome in England or Germany...

25:55.253 --> 25:59.587
or France or Italy,
or even all-forgiving Scandinavia.

25:59.658 --> 26:03.492
We would make sure that she had no
choice but to go back to Saudi Arabia...

26:03.562 --> 26:08.431
and get fat and wear a burka
for the rest of her miserable life.

26:34.125 --> 26:38.562
What do you do for Abu Nazir
in return for the money he gives you?

26:38.630 --> 26:44.330
What do you do for Abu Nazir
in return for the money he gives you?

26:44.402 --> 26:47.371
I keep my ears open.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.808
Tell him what the Saudi government
is thinking. General information.

26:51.876 --> 26:55.869
You met with Tom Walker at least three times
at the Mount Olivet mosque last week, correct?

26:58.049 --> 26:59.880
Yes.

26:59.951 --> 27:04.581
- Tom Walker <i>is</i> working for Abu Nazir?
- Yes.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.715
Was he meant to shoot the president...

27:06.791 --> 27:09.760
from the roof of the house
near Ronald Reagan Airport?

27:09.828 --> 27:12.729
I don't know anything about that.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.766
- Where is Tom Walker now?
- He's lying low.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.462
- Where?
- I don't know.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.527
- What's his current assignment?
- I don't know.

27:20.605 --> 27:23.699
- When will you know?
- When Abu Nazir decides to tell me.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.374
What's the tradecraft
for setting a meeting with Walker?

27:38.723 --> 27:41.521
I put my child's drawing of a red heart...

27:41.593 --> 27:45.188
in the window of my living room.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.130
When would the meeting take place?

27:48.199 --> 27:50.394
The next day at noon.

27:50.468 --> 27:51.799
Where?

27:56.174 --> 27:59.837
Farragut Square, by the fountain.

27:59.911 --> 28:02.937
Mr. Al-Zahrani, I'd like you
to go back to your house now.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.881
Put that drawing in your window tonight.

28:05.950 --> 28:09.477
Tomorrow afternoon, I'd like you to proceed
as you normally would to meet Tom Walker.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.044
Okay?

28:11.122 --> 28:14.216
- So I'm bait?
- You're bait.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.451
You're free to go now.

28:21.966 --> 28:24.400
What happens to me after all of this?

28:24.469 --> 28:26.596
Go about your business. Live your life.

28:26.671 --> 28:29.538
We say nothing to Saudi Intelligence
about your connections to Abu Nazir.

28:29.607 --> 28:32.508
You say nothing to Abu Nazir
about our little get-together.

28:33.244 --> 28:35.075
You work for us now.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.410
Welcome to the C.I.A.

28:44.322 --> 28:48.190
Damn it! Ow.

29:00.038 --> 29:02.199
- Mike.
- Hello.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.770
Hi. Come in.

29:05.844 --> 29:08.369
No, it's better if I stay out here.

29:08.446 --> 29:10.471
Oh, okay.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.350
- How have you been?
- Shitty.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.649
- Brody came to see me.
- He did?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.720
He apologized for slugging me.

29:26.297 --> 29:29.733
He said he doesn't blame
either one of us for anything.

29:29.801 --> 29:32.565
I mean, Christ, he even thanked
me for taking care of the kids.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.662
- Oh, God.
- I know.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.730
He's trying, Jess. He's really trying.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.808
He told me about being asked
to run for Congress.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.871
Told me you were against it.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.184
I'm just thinking of the family.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.222
What's best for the family.

29:53.091 --> 29:56.959
Jess, right now,
Brody's a marine without a mission.

29:57.028 --> 30:01.362
He's a lost man wandering around in the
fog. This thing really means a lot to him.

30:01.432 --> 30:04.299
He wants to be of service.
He wants to do this.

30:05.069 --> 30:07.060
Let him.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.698
He'll be a better father, better husband.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.707
He put you up to this.

30:20.718 --> 30:25.178
Yeah, he did. So what? He's right.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.559
That's unbelievable.

30:29.627 --> 30:33.290
He comes to you,
and now here you are on his behalf?

30:33.364 --> 30:34.922
It's a little incestuous, isn't it?

30:34.999 --> 30:37.968
Why don't we all just take off our clothes
and get in bed together?

30:38.036 --> 30:40.368
- Jess, come on.
- I gotta go.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.093
- Hi there.
- Hi.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.086
Come on in.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.973
Miles Davis. You like jazz?

31:58.049 --> 32:00.210
I don't know anything about it.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.561
- Here we go.
- Oh. No, thanks.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.460
I really just came around
to ask you somethin'.

32:17.535 --> 32:20.527
- And I need you to be honest.
- What?

32:20.605 --> 32:24.166
Does anybody at the C.I.A.
Know about our weekend up at the cabin?

32:24.242 --> 32:25.300
No.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.276
- You didn't tell anybody?
- No.

32:27.345 --> 32:30.508
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.042
Is there any way they <i>could</i> find out?

32:34.118 --> 32:37.087
- Not unless I <i>did</i> tell them.
- Which you wouldn't do.

32:37.155 --> 32:42.024
- Oh, believe it or not, I value my privacy.
- Yeah.

32:42.093 --> 32:45.324
- Why the concern?
- I've been asked to run for political office.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.898
Huh, political office.
What are you talking about?

32:49.968 --> 32:53.267
Vice President Walden wants me to run
for Congressman Johnson's seat.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.100
Really? Wow.

32:59.310 --> 33:03.770
Well, that's- That's surprising.

33:03.848 --> 33:07.614
I don't want to do it if there's even a
chance the media would find out about us.

33:07.685 --> 33:10.119
I can't do that to Jessica.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.715
I've been shitty enough as it is,
and she deserves better.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.427
And she's gonna get it.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.899
Jessica will never know.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.568
Thanks.

33:32.577 --> 33:36.741
- I should get back home.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm beat.

33:36.814 --> 33:38.805
It's been a rough day.

33:50.661 --> 33:54.324
You promise me this will stay between us?

33:54.399 --> 33:56.230
I promise.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.395
Good-bye.

34:00.471 --> 34:01.961
Good night.

36:51.909 --> 36:55.606
Off to work we go.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.111
<i>All right, we're about 20 minutes out.</i>

37:04.555 --> 37:06.045
Excuse me.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.619
- Saul, any sign of Walker?
- Nothing yet.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.426
We got 15 of our people in the square...

37:14.498 --> 37:16.591
and Carrie's runnin' point down there.

37:46.297 --> 37:50.131
Remember, everybody,
Walker is armed and dangerous.

37:50.201 --> 37:54.069
We don't want a firefight.
We wanna nab him, not spook him.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.663
<i>Don't move until Walker's</i>
<i>in the grab zone.</i>

37:56.741 --> 37:57.833
Carrie?

37:57.908 --> 37:59.773
<i>I know the protocol, Saul.</i>

37:59.844 --> 38:02.369
<i>This isn't my first polka.</i>

38:08.953 --> 38:11.683
- <i>Whit, how you doing?</i>
- Sniper 1 in position.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.385
<i>We're passing National Cathedral.</i>

38:15.459 --> 38:17.484
<i>Traffic is loosenin'up.</i>
<i>We should be there any minute.</i>

38:27.705 --> 38:29.195
Any sign of Walker?

38:33.911 --> 38:36.175
- Quadrant report.
- <i>North. No Walker.</i>

38:36.247 --> 38:38.238
<i>East. Nothing.</i>

38:38.316 --> 38:39.874
<i>West. Negative.</i>

38:39.950 --> 38:42.077
- South?
- <i>South. Nothing.</i>

38:43.321 --> 38:45.118
Okay, we're here.

38:59.537 --> 39:02.700
<i>Al-Zahrani's moving into</i>
<i>Farragut Square, southwest corner.</i>

39:06.711 --> 39:08.474
We got al-Zahrani.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.783
Where the fuck is Walker?

39:22.460 --> 39:23.950
<i>I'm looking.</i>

39:25.429 --> 39:27.294
I'm looking.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.954
<i>Zahrani's approaching the fountain.</i>

39:53.724 --> 39:55.487
<i>Bait is set.</i>

40:02.833 --> 40:04.323
10:00.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.933
Possible Walker.
He's, uh, got a green watch cap.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.304
Black fleece. He's carrying a briefcase.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.483
- Target in range.
- <i>Whit, don't get trigger-happy.</i>

40:24.555 --> 40:27.683
<i>You're just there in case</i>
<i>this whole thing goes to shit.</i>

40:27.758 --> 40:31.159
Looks like he's headed
to the fountain all right.

40:31.228 --> 40:34.891
Nobody makes a move until
Walker's in the grab zone.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.163
I can't see his face.
I need visual confirmation.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.869
- Finklestein, you're up front.
Go for a clear view.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

40:46.944 --> 40:49.310
<i>Franklin, Patrelli,</i>
<i>approach him from the east.</i>

40:49.380 --> 40:51.007
- <i>10-4.</i>
- <i>On it.</i>

40:51.081 --> 40:53.072
<i>He's approaching al-Zahrani.</i>

40:53.150 --> 40:55.914
- <i>I want that positive I.D. Now.</i>
- <i>Shit.</i>

40:55.986 --> 40:57.851
- Finklestein?
- <i>I'm tryin'.</i>

40:58.989 --> 41:00.513
Franklin? Patrelli?

41:00.591 --> 41:03.424
<i>It could be Walker.</i>
<i>Hard to tell. His head is down.</i>

41:03.494 --> 41:07.931
- Patrelli?
- <i>Black male, six feet, clean-shaven, athletic.</i>

41:07.998 --> 41:09.898
<i>I can't tell.</i>

41:11.769 --> 41:13.760
He's carrying the briefcase
in his left hand.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.772
- So?
- Walker's right-handed.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.831
What about his watch?
Does anybody see his watch?

41:19.844 --> 41:22.574
- It's on his right wrist.
- I don't like this, Saul.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.546
- Should I engage?
- <i>Negative.</i>

41:24.615 --> 41:28.346
What's in the briefcase?
Saul, what's in the fucking briefcase?

41:30.788 --> 41:32.779
- Wait for my command.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

41:32.857 --> 41:35.052
Shit! Sorry. Pull back.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.116
Pull back. Get everyone out of here.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.396
Everyone, get out of here!

41:53.878 --> 41:55.709
<i>Anyone in quadrant two-</i>

42:04.655 --> 42:06.088
Carrie!

42:06.991 --> 42:08.481
Carrie.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.450
Carrie?

42:45.362 --> 42:50.299
<i>The explosion occurred during the busy lunch</i>
<i>hour and killed five people, wounded dozens...</i>

42:50.367 --> 42:52.392
<i>and shut down the city Metro line.</i>

42:52.469 --> 42:56.701
<i>F.B.I. Special agents have joined D.C.</i>
<i>Police in cordoning off the area.</i>

42:56.774 --> 42:59.641
It was a suicide bomber.
A terrorist attack right here in D.C.

42:59.710 --> 43:02.907
- We don't know that.
- It's just unbelievable.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.380
Hey. Hey. Listen.

43:05.449 --> 43:09.146
It's probably just some crazy guy who
learned how to make a bomb on the Internet.

43:09.219 --> 43:11.016
Okay?

43:11.088 --> 43:13.352
The most important thing is not to panic.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.351
Okay.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.657
- Where are the kids?
- They're doing their homework.

43:18.729 --> 43:21.061
- Are they okay?
- They're scared.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.122
All right. I'll go and talk to 'em.

43:26.704 --> 43:31.539
Hey. Did you think any more about the, uh,
politics of it all?

43:37.381 --> 43:39.542
Mike delivered your message.

43:42.052 --> 43:44.816
And?

43:44.888 --> 43:48.380
- I told the kids about the vice
president wanting you to run.
- You told 'em?

43:48.459 --> 43:50.825
We discussed how
it would affect our future.

43:50.894 --> 43:54.557
That there would be publicity
and scrutiny and gossip.

43:56.500 --> 44:00.197
But in the end, we all agreed
that we wanted you to do it.

44:03.273 --> 44:06.208
Just to be clear, are you saying yes?

44:08.045 --> 44:10.775
Just promise me I won't lose you again.

44:10.848 --> 44:12.782
I promise.

44:14.418 --> 44:17.285
Then, yes. It's a yes.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.588
Vice President-

44:52.656 --> 44:55.648
Thanks for coming out, folks.

45:01.632 --> 45:05.568
Right this way,
please. Very nice, thank you.
- Nice!

45:13.177 --> 45:15.168
Dr. Steiner says you're gonna live.

45:16.547 --> 45:19.107
All you got
was a really bad concussion.

45:19.183 --> 45:21.549
No more head-bashing for a while.

45:21.618 --> 45:23.677
Cut back on the drinkin'.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.745
Otherwise, you're good to go.

45:31.095 --> 45:35.293
Get some really good drugs and a week's rest
before you head back to the glue factory.

45:36.433 --> 45:39.027
I'd love some good drugs
and a week's rest.

45:39.103 --> 45:40.627
Lucky you.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.401
In case you're wondering
about the bomber-

45:44.475 --> 45:46.875
black guy with the briefcase.

45:46.944 --> 45:48.673
His name was Samuel Everett.

45:48.746 --> 45:52.079
Homeless guy.
Walker met him at the shelter.

45:52.149 --> 45:54.515
Must have paid him to go meet al-Zahrani.

45:58.655 --> 46:01.283
How did Walker know?

46:01.358 --> 46:03.485
Who warned him?

46:03.560 --> 46:07.360
Same person who slipped Hamid a razor
blade so that he could slash his wrists.

46:07.431 --> 46:10.195
And the same person who warned Raquim
Faisel and Aileen Morgan...

46:10.267 --> 46:13.065
that we were onto their safe house
near the airport.

46:16.039 --> 46:18.872
You were right.

46:18.942 --> 46:21.376
Abu Nazir has someone
inside the U.S. Government.

46:21.445 --> 46:24.312
<i>We take you now, live,</i>
<i>to the Capitol steps...</i>

46:24.381 --> 46:27.714
<i>where the vice president</i>
<i>is set to make his announcement.</i>

46:27.785 --> 46:30.913
<i>Sergeant Brody is exactly</i>
<i>the kind of congressman we need.</i>

46:30.988 --> 46:33.582
- <i>His strength of character</i>
<i>is beyond question-</i>
- Turn it up.

46:33.657 --> 46:35.852
<i>And he is resolute</i>
<i>in the fight against terrorism...</i>

46:35.926 --> 46:38.759
<i>which struck at the heart</i>
<i>of this nation's capital just yesterday.</i>

46:38.829 --> 46:41.957
<i>He will be equally resolute in the fight</i>
<i>against runaway spending...</i>

46:42.032 --> 46:45.399
<i>and profligate management</i>
<i>at the highest levels of government.</i>

46:47.304 --> 46:51.001
<i>It gives me great pleasure and</i>
<i>pride to stand here today before you...</i>

46:51.074 --> 46:54.532
<i>having been given</i>
<i>the generous opportunity to serve.</i>

46:54.611 --> 46:57.136
<i>You know what I really</i>
<i>came to understand...</i>

46:57.214 --> 47:00.183
<i>lying in a dark hole for eight years</i>
<i>in the Middle East...</i>

47:00.250 --> 47:03.276
<i>was that service for your country</i>
<i>is the highest calling...</i>

47:05.189 --> 47:07.316
<i>sacred and profound.</i>
