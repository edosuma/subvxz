Deputy Chief Brenda johnson.

01:17.343 --> 01:19.255
Where is that? 

01:19.655 --> 01:20.755
What?

01:20.775 --> 01:22.567
Oh, no. My ringer wasn't on.

01:22.587 --> 01:25.059
Damn it. I have a land line, you know.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.852
All right, sergeant Gabriel.

01:29.162 --> 01:30.863
Speak up, please, i can't hear you.

01:30.893 --> 01:33.055
And start with directions.

01:33.346 --> 01:34.856
Thank you.

01:35.687 --> 01:37.088
Where's that?

01:37.468 --> 01:40.081
Ok. How do you get there?

01:40.961 --> 01:43.543
No, no comment. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:43.573 --> 01:45.185
It's Dr. Alan Rainey,

01:45.214 --> 01:48.958
director of the research center for the
university's neuropsychiatric institute.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.061
Thank you.

01:50.096 --> 01:51.089
He's a real big-time brain.

01:51.109 --> 01:53.752
Now, we got no signs of a
break-in, there's no theft.

01:53.772 --> 01:55.823
See, he's still got
his wallet on him there.

01:55.863 --> 01:57.334
He's got all sorts of awards,

01:57.354 --> 01:59.555
probably headed for a
picture in the encyclopedia

01:59.575 --> 02:01.786
before 8:00 this morning.

02:01.786 --> 02:04.289
And as far as we can tell...

02:04.869 --> 02:06.190
everyone loved the guy.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.282
Well, not everyone.

02:09.021 --> 02:12.505
Why is his mouth lodged open like that?

02:12.615 --> 02:14.607
Doesn't seem to be any blockage.

02:14.637 --> 02:15.817
Here's what hung him up.

02:15.847 --> 02:18.720
I'm guessing the blood
work's gonna match.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.842
I don't think that's
what killed him, though.

02:20.872 --> 02:24.875
I have a strong feeling Dr.
Rainey spent his last few seconds

02:24.885 --> 02:27.507
gasping for air.

02:27.566 --> 02:29.438
Yeah. Red dots on the eyes.

02:29.468 --> 02:31.499
Petechial hemorrhaging.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.691
He suffocated.

02:33.761 --> 02:36.774
Wife's outside in the hallway
demanding to see the body.

02:36.784 --> 02:41.048
Could you, uh, calm her down, please,
and find someplace that we can talk?

02:42.908 --> 02:45.771
Detective Sanchez, put those
files back where they belong.

02:45.811 --> 02:47.853
Lieutenant Provenza, can
you please explain to me

02:47.873 --> 02:51.106
how you happen to be looking through
a psychiatrist's appointment book?

02:51.496 --> 02:52.966
The wind blew it off the desk

02:52.996 --> 02:56.730
and momentarily exposed its
pages to my photographic memory.

02:56.740 --> 03:01.494
All communications between a psychiatrist and his
patient carry the same level of confidentiality

03:01.544 --> 03:03.634
as attorney/client privilege.

03:03.654 --> 03:06.296
Now, let's leave the files and the
appointment book where it belongs, please,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.428
and let's concentrate
on what can be removed.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.349
Such as?

03:09.389 --> 03:11.350
The cushions from the couch.
Have S.I.D. pack them up

03:11.380 --> 03:13.401
and take them to Forensics,
please. Thank you.

03:13.431 --> 03:14.553
Yes, madam.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.234
Sergeant Gabriel.

03:18.956 --> 03:20.817
Um, i was just wondering,

03:20.837 --> 03:23.609
is there, uh, a reward
for reporting a murder?

03:23.650 --> 03:27.639
Yes. Thank you so much
for serving your community.

03:31.124 --> 03:32.761
I warned him.

03:32.992 --> 03:35.643
But he wanted to do the study.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.470
What study?

03:37.500 --> 03:41.839
It's a clinical trial for a
new antidepressant designed...

03:42.141 --> 03:43.838
Excuse me.

03:46.157 --> 03:50.747
designed to treat drug
addiction in teenagers.

03:50.757 --> 03:53.659
Alan took it up i think in part
because i work with these children.

03:53.799 --> 03:55.517
In what capacity?

03:55.557 --> 03:56.823
I'm a psychiatrist also,

03:56.843 --> 03:59.383
working with juvenile offenders.

04:00.448 --> 04:04.143
Kids do crystal or X for a few days,

04:04.183 --> 04:08.180
they have a psychotic break and
do something violent like this.

04:09.103 --> 04:14.506
I told him to be careful, but he
wanted to try to save these children.

04:14.607 --> 04:16.875
I felt selfish interfering.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.106
But i was right.

04:21.947 --> 04:24.849
The university had
started up a clinical trial

04:24.869 --> 04:27.240
paid for by Curson pharmaceutical.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.474
Enrolled over 2000 addicted teens.

04:30.494 --> 04:32.774
So we have a few suspects.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.922
This new antidepressant's
supposed to keep kids

04:34.962 --> 04:38.909
from using drugs and
relieve their anxiety.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.476
Well, it doesn't seem to be working.

04:40.506 --> 04:43.328
Maybe because only half
the kids got the medication.

04:43.348 --> 04:46.250
The rest, a control
group, were on placebo.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.650
And we can't go through
the doctor's files, chief?

04:48.680 --> 04:50.016
No. Not an option.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.231
Well, cause if you ask me,

04:51.251 --> 04:52.898
i say the doer's in those records.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.676
I mean, how are we supposed
to narrow down the field if...

04:54.696 --> 04:56.202
Excuse me, lieutenant Flynn.

04:56.242 --> 04:58.020
How's the clinical trial going?

04:58.050 --> 05:00.169
No news from the drug company.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.729
But we found a civil suit
brought against Curson

05:02.759 --> 05:05.773
and Dr. Rainey by a
Mr. and Mrs. Hammond.

05:05.783 --> 05:10.442
It says their son Cody, 16, died from
side effects related to the medication.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.039
But the case was thrown out of court.

05:12.069 --> 05:13.325
Well, that's something.

05:13.345 --> 05:15.965
Look, i know you think
this patient/doctor thing

05:15.985 --> 05:17.612
is some kind of sacred cow,

05:17.642 --> 05:18.857
but it's a crime scene,

05:18.867 --> 05:20.956
and i know a judge who
understands these things.

05:20.976 --> 05:23.758
He can appoint a special master
to look through Rainey's files.

05:23.778 --> 05:25.595
Thanks for your advice,
lieutenant Flynn.

05:25.635 --> 05:29.683
What about campus security? Did Dr. Rainey
file any complaints with them lately?

05:29.763 --> 05:33.499
He helped evaluate these kids, maybe
he had a confrontation with one of them.

05:33.539 --> 05:35.959
Lieutenant Provenza, could
you look into that, please?

05:35.979 --> 05:39.153
And detective Sanchez, will you
follow up on their list of no-admits?

05:39.173 --> 05:41.995
Detective Daniels, i want to know everything
i can about the Hammonds and their son.

05:42.085 --> 05:44.866
Lieutenant Flynn, phone dump.
Find out who's been calling him.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.785
Sergeant Gabriel, get to know our widow.

05:46.815 --> 05:50.400
Lieutenant Tao, i want to meet with Dr.
Rainey's colleagues on this clinical trial

05:50.420 --> 05:52.459
and as soon as possible,
please. Thank you.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.264
If we move today, we can get the
special master process rolling.

06:00.623 --> 06:03.438
Look, chief, i'm just trying to avoid

06:03.469 --> 06:06.252
creating more tension in the squad
than there is already, you know?

06:06.433 --> 06:07.900
Yeah. Huh huh.

06:08.449 --> 06:11.513
Look, here's the problem
you're dealing with.

06:11.992 --> 06:15.606
Brenda went through an ethics inquiry

06:15.626 --> 06:17.573
when she was with the Atlanta P.D.

06:17.603 --> 06:20.728
It's made her a little extra
careful about these things,

06:20.768 --> 06:23.132
which is not always bad.

06:23.172 --> 06:25.188
Ethics inquiry, huh?

06:25.577 --> 06:27.114
That doesn't seem right.

06:27.135 --> 06:28.303
She loves the rules.

06:28.332 --> 06:31.457
Well, you know how
unfair all that can be.

06:31.477 --> 06:33.882
But, once bitten...

06:34.042 --> 06:37.017
She didn't respond to
your suggestion at all?

06:38.164 --> 06:39.252
No.

06:39.312 --> 06:43.016
Well, i found out a long time ago,

06:43.057 --> 06:47.738
a lot of this can just be in how
Deputy Chief Johnson is approached.

06:47.777 --> 06:50.313
Get the special master
paperwork started.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.861
I'll talk to her.

06:51.911 --> 06:56.462
And, uh, the business about the ethics inquiry,
i'd appreciate it if that stays just between us.

06:56.862 --> 06:57.910
You got it, chief.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.098
Sure.

07:00.316 --> 07:02.089
Thanks.

07:04.818 --> 07:08.088
Uh, normally, when you test a drug like
this, you do it in different stages,

07:08.118 --> 07:10.919
but, in developing
medication for adolescents,

07:10.938 --> 07:15.800
which is my specialty, why Dr.
Rainey included me in his study,

07:15.950 --> 07:18.110
you conduct all 3 phases at once.

07:18.130 --> 07:20.031
Because the kids are still growing,

07:20.051 --> 07:22.712
their bodies change a lot
during the course of the trial.

07:22.732 --> 07:25.712
At least, that's the scientific reason.

07:25.752 --> 07:27.901
And how is the study going?

07:28.452 --> 07:32.873
Well, Alan, uh, Dr. Rainey,
and i were disappointed.

07:33.082 --> 07:36.343
For every kid who showed some
benefit from the medication,

07:36.384 --> 07:39.605
there were reports of
sleeplessness or aggression.

07:39.635 --> 07:43.175
And we discovered that if you
abruptly withdrew the drug...

07:43.226 --> 07:45.206
it caused health risks.

07:45.356 --> 07:48.696
Such as convulsions, coma, and death.

07:48.716 --> 07:52.338
You mean the Cody
Hammond lawsuit, right.

07:52.378 --> 07:54.158
That was awful.

07:54.228 --> 07:56.799
After he died, i told Alan
we should approach Curson

07:56.829 --> 07:59.950
about shutting down
the trial, which he did.

07:59.989 --> 08:02.009
They wouldn't even discuss it.

08:02.039 --> 08:03.810
Oh, i'm sorry.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.810
One of the great things about
specializing in adolescents

08:05.820 --> 08:08.861
is answering text messages all day.

08:10.213 --> 08:11.462
Can i still...

08:11.492 --> 08:13.602
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure. Fine.

08:13.612 --> 08:17.404
Would it cost a lot of
money to shut the study down?

08:17.444 --> 08:20.324
Uh, well, there'd be a big
delay in the approval process.

08:20.354 --> 08:21.755
They'd have to start another trial.

08:21.784 --> 08:27.216
So, yeah, i mean, it could end up
costing Curson maybe $100 million.

08:28.195 --> 08:29.426
Sorry.

08:30.746 --> 08:33.645
So what happens to the study now?

08:34.875 --> 08:36.827
Not sure.

08:36.886 --> 08:41.878
I suggested that it at least be
put on hold, but Curson refused.

08:42.809 --> 08:46.329
Do you have any idea who would
have done this to Dr. Rainey?

08:46.789 --> 08:51.581
It seems too over the top, doesn't it, i mean,
for it to have been someone from the drug company?

08:52.070 --> 08:53.900
Doesn't it?

08:54.531 --> 08:56.232
I don't know.

08:58.991 --> 09:00.611
Oh. Are we early?

09:00.652 --> 09:03.533
Listen, i'll be with
you guys in a minute.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.664
Sorry, it's my group therapy session.

09:08.704 --> 09:10.575
Oh. It's part of the study.

09:10.635 --> 09:11.704
Right.

09:12.435 --> 09:15.546
Seeing them together
generates a lot of fast data.

09:15.566 --> 09:18.746
You know, my storage system leaves
a little something to be desired.

09:19.047 --> 09:21.178
Oh, it looks like mine.

09:21.548 --> 09:26.649
I just moved here and i've got all these
boxes and i can't seem to get them unpacked.

09:27.248 --> 09:31.369
Well, sometimes when we make big life
changes, we're not ready to make them real.

09:31.721 --> 09:33.740
For whatever reason.

09:33.770 --> 09:37.410
Sorry. My group showed up and
i just slipped into shrink mode.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.552
I bring that out in people.

09:39.572 --> 09:44.283
Um, so, who would i talk to at the drug
company to get the ball rolling here?

09:45.499 --> 09:49.513
I am the co-founder and
director of research for Curson.

09:50.039 --> 09:52.105
There is no going over my head!

09:52.135 --> 09:54.478
There's always your board
of directors, Dr. Dawson.

09:54.518 --> 09:57.078
I'd appreciate it if you could
lower your voice just a little bit.

09:57.423 --> 10:01.206
Listen, lady, you want to get your name
in the papers, great. Go catch criminals,

10:01.497 --> 10:04.312
but leave my company alone.

10:05.603 --> 10:07.309
Got some breaking news.

10:07.329 --> 10:09.266
I think we may have found the chink

10:09.296 --> 10:12.069
in our chief's armor-plated wonder bra.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.060
- What? It's just an expression.
- Meaning?

10:14.409 --> 10:16.961
Meaning that our little
miss do-it-by-the-book here

10:16.992 --> 10:21.864
came to our department after a
major ethics inquiry in Atlanta.

10:21.884 --> 10:23.439
How about that?

10:23.469 --> 10:25.264
Tao, i'm going to need
your help with this.

10:25.284 --> 10:26.696
How?

10:26.746 --> 10:29.843
While my competitors
are busy growing hair

10:29.873 --> 10:31.820
and sending blood to your crotch,

10:31.850 --> 10:35.564
i have been working to
save humanity. Humanity!

10:35.887 --> 10:39.094
Look, all i'm asking for you to do is
release the names of the young people who..

10:39.416 --> 10:42.080
Look, i am not going to confuse you

10:42.109 --> 10:43.936
with a lot of technical terms

10:43.965 --> 10:46.810
like double-blind and
objective abstracts.

10:46.850 --> 10:47.960
all you need to know

10:48.000 --> 10:51.137
is that giving you these
names destroys my study,

10:51.158 --> 10:53.781
and then it's going to
be another 4 to 5 years

10:53.801 --> 10:56.150
before i can bring that
medication to market.

10:56.181 --> 11:01.729
Couldn't Dr. Rainey have caused the same delay by
publishing the negative results of his research?

11:02.132 --> 11:03.414
What are you implying?

11:03.444 --> 11:07.318
I don't want to confuse you with
technical terms like suspect and motives.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.969
I'm just going to explain that i'm
looking for a bad guy who killed someone,

11:11.383 --> 11:14.116
and i'm beginning to
think that you'll do.

11:14.408 --> 11:15.398
All right.

11:16.538 --> 11:18.514
Now you listen to me, you little bitch.

11:18.554 --> 11:22.460
If the L.A.P.D. does
anything to threaten

11:22.490 --> 11:25.224
the viability of these clinical trials,

11:25.244 --> 11:31.095
i will see to it personally
that you are destroyed.

11:31.165 --> 11:35.634
Is that what you did to Dr. Rainey?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.291
Here we go. Atlanta Sun news,

11:50.321 --> 11:51.953
"Captain Brenda Leigh Johnson,

11:51.973 --> 11:55.265
currently on leave
pending investigation."

11:55.306 --> 11:57.159
Look at that. Look at that.

11:57.188 --> 11:59.701
"Alleged sexual misconduct."

11:59.731 --> 12:00.522
Let me see.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.474
"Matter referred to internal affairs.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.117
Johnson not available for comment."

12:05.147 --> 12:06.418
Well, it doesn't say what she did.

12:06.449 --> 12:08.771
Oh, come on. You're not defending her.

12:09.233 --> 12:10.855
What, admit it, guys.

12:10.885 --> 12:13.877
Hasn't she dropped just a couple
of notches in your estimation?

12:13.927 --> 12:16.901
Nah. She's gone up a couple
of notches in my imagination.

12:16.941 --> 12:18.963
So what are we doing?

12:28.105 --> 12:30.788
The phone dump from
Rainey's office showed

12:30.817 --> 12:36.244
Cody Hammond's parents logged an average
of 5 calls a day up until a week ago.

12:36.524 --> 12:38.766
It's got to be about what
happened to their son.

12:38.796 --> 12:40.318
Ok. You set up there?

12:40.348 --> 12:44.923
Yeah, but i had to make it sound like Cody
and Dr. Rainey's deaths were linked somehow.

12:45.234 --> 12:46.396
They're home this afternoon.

12:46.436 --> 12:47.397
Ok.

12:47.437 --> 12:49.238
One thing kind of interesting.

12:49.279 --> 12:51.461
Rainey's last call before he died,

12:51.491 --> 12:53.774
to the police for, like, 5 seconds,

12:53.804 --> 12:58.259
but the log shows very
few calls from the kids.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.330
There were some, though?

12:59.361 --> 13:02.444
Yeah. Small list. Good luck with it.

13:02.704 --> 13:06.028
Campus police gave us the name of a
boy Dr. Rainey kicked out of the study.

13:06.187 --> 13:07.980
He was put on the no admit list,

13:08.020 --> 13:10.944
but he showed up on the security
camera the day of the murder.

13:10.974 --> 13:12.165
Eric Placton.

13:12.195 --> 13:15.079
All right. Let's get him in
here. See what he has to say.

13:15.109 --> 13:17.832
Sergeant Gabriel, would
you come with me, please?

13:21.045 --> 13:22.146
- Brenda.
- Yes.

13:22.187 --> 13:23.348
Need a minute.

13:23.368 --> 13:26.742
Gabriel, why don't you go? Away.

13:28.714 --> 13:32.649
Curson pharmaceuticals'
legal team is coming after us,

13:32.679 --> 13:34.711
and i think it's time to get creative.

13:34.741 --> 13:36.854
Lieutenant Flynn reminded
me about the possibility

13:36.894 --> 13:38.656
of going through Dr. Rainey's files

13:38.686 --> 13:40.678
via the special master process.

13:40.708 --> 13:43.191
He's done all the paper
work, and i'd like you,

13:43.231 --> 13:46.285
at your convenience, to listen to
his idea about how this might work.

13:46.315 --> 13:48.477
Well, there's no time like the present.

13:48.517 --> 13:50.770
Lieutenant Flynn, let's talk it through.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.312
There you go.

13:52.372 --> 13:54.184
The approach.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.089
Have a seat.

14:04.596 --> 14:06.939
I should like to state
as emphatically as i can

14:06.989 --> 14:10.393
how unhappy i am that
you went over my head.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.385
This idea of yours is a no-go,

14:12.414 --> 14:15.888
because i don't like waiting around for
2 months while a judge determines exactly

14:15.969 --> 14:20.083
what a special master can do in this
case and then maybe lose the hearing.

14:20.184 --> 14:23.357
However, if we find ourselves reduced

14:23.398 --> 14:26.120
to pursuing alternatives
of a dubious legal nature

14:26.150 --> 14:28.674
or should the sun explode,

14:28.714 --> 14:31.237
i promise to reconsider your suggestion.

14:31.267 --> 14:36.113
Meanwhile, i expect you to get the kids from
the phone dump into this office for interviews.

14:36.203 --> 14:37.465
Thank you.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.501
Whatever you say, madam.

14:48.767 --> 14:49.899
Sergeant Gabriel.

14:49.929 --> 14:51.150
Yes.

14:52.361 --> 14:56.437
So, uh... can we talk about
something here for a second?

14:56.467 --> 14:57.628
What?

14:57.668 --> 15:00.291
Uh, well, it's got to do with...

15:00.321 --> 15:03.014
Ethics and i was just
wondering if there was any...

15:03.063 --> 15:04.855
I know what you're going
to say, sergeant Gabriel.

15:05.119 --> 15:05.948
You do?

15:05.987 --> 15:08.341
Yes, and let's just discuss
it and get it out of the way.

15:08.361 --> 15:10.053
Well, i mean, maybe it's
none of my business..

15:10.083 --> 15:12.315
Oh, of course, it's your
business. We work together.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.867
True, but only if you
feel like talking about it.

15:14.907 --> 15:16.048
Here's the truth.

15:16.059 --> 15:18.632
In reality, nothing would please me more

15:18.672 --> 15:22.746
than to go into Dr. Rainey's office and examine
his files, get the names of the teenagers

15:22.986 --> 15:27.512
in that study or find proof that Dr.
Dawson and his drug company were trying to

15:27.531 --> 15:31.657
manipulate the data to gain approval for his
new medication, but, and here's the problem,

15:31.717 --> 15:34.230
and it's not just an issue of ethics.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.262
It's an issue of logic.

15:36.292 --> 15:38.835
If Dr. Rainey's files are so important,

15:38.865 --> 15:41.258
that.. what?

15:41.478 --> 15:44.191
Now then, you're talking about the case?

15:44.231 --> 15:45.843
What did you think i was talking about?

15:45.883 --> 15:49.858
Uh, that's it. I'm following you,
if the files are so important,

15:49.948 --> 15:52.579
then why are they still
in the victim's office?

15:52.609 --> 15:54.529
I'm sorry. What are you...

15:54.549 --> 15:57.139
If Dr. Rainey's files could
tell us who murdered him,

15:57.219 --> 16:00.379
then why didn't the killer take them?

16:01.389 --> 16:02.808
That's a very interesting question.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.349
And one we don't have the answer to.

16:04.379 --> 16:08.309
So while lieutenant Flynn gets
all bent out of shape with me,

16:08.339 --> 16:10.929
i want to find out who's all
bent out of shape with Dr. Rainey.

16:10.949 --> 16:11.839
For example...

16:11.879 --> 16:12.909
the parents of Cody Hammond.

16:12.988 --> 16:13.948
Right.

16:14.228 --> 16:16.669
They called it complications.

16:16.699 --> 16:19.079
I called it murder.

16:19.109 --> 16:22.358
And i even said it in court.

16:23.387 --> 16:25.568
The judge said i was out of order.

16:25.588 --> 16:28.688
That bastard Rainey

16:28.708 --> 16:32.068
turned him into a guinea
pig and then let him die.

16:32.098 --> 16:34.648
And did the medication help at all?

16:34.678 --> 16:37.478
At first we saw some good changes.

16:37.508 --> 16:39.478
We were happy he wasn't on the placebo.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.268
He stopped disappearing on weekends.

16:42.358 --> 16:45.958
It was like we were a family again.

16:45.998 --> 16:49.108
You said Dr. Rainey let him die?

16:49.808 --> 16:54.758
The medication started to make him sick,

16:54.798 --> 17:00.328
and the doctors just
took him off the pills.

17:00.348 --> 17:05.308
12 hours later...

17:07.858 --> 17:09.897
He said he was tired

17:09.938 --> 17:11.348
and he said he was dizzy.

17:11.387 --> 17:14.188
Then he started shaking, couldn't stop.

17:14.229 --> 17:15.728
I called an ambulance

17:15.768 --> 17:19.098
and while we were waiting
for it to get here,

17:19.128 --> 17:21.538
Cody had a seizure.

17:21.598 --> 17:24.019
When the paramedics arrived,

17:24.069 --> 17:28.898
my son was lying dead
by the dining room table.

17:35.418 --> 17:38.207
But none of that matters,

17:38.267 --> 17:39.557
cause you didn't come here

17:39.618 --> 17:43.958
to investigate what
happened to Cody anyway.

17:44.258 --> 17:45.988
Did you?

17:57.068 --> 18:01.718
We signed the agreement to
give Cody the medication.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.307
We were desperate that he get well.

18:04.338 --> 18:09.188
And we let Dr. Rainey and
the drug company kill him.

18:09.208 --> 18:10.508
And they get away with it

18:10.528 --> 18:14.388
and just go on with
the rest of their lives.

18:16.158 --> 18:18.969
Not Dr. Rainey.

18:20.028 --> 18:23.058
And not Cody.

18:31.118 --> 18:33.147
Lieutenant, what's all this?

18:33.177 --> 18:35.167
Oh, uh... Didn't you hear?

18:35.207 --> 18:38.488
It's bring a juvenile
offender to work day.

18:38.538 --> 18:40.967
Oh, and i left my kids at home.

18:41.227 --> 18:42.837
Miss atlan...

18:42.877 --> 18:44.957
I mean, Deputy Chief Johnson,

18:44.998 --> 18:48.817
decided that before we delve into
this whole special master business,

18:48.847 --> 18:51.508
she wanted us to interview as
many kids from the drug trial

18:51.528 --> 18:53.148
as we could put names to.

18:53.168 --> 18:56.048
So instead of going through
the victims' files...

18:56.078 --> 18:58.947
Yeah, we're filling up the
joint with teenage junkies.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.558
Well, i'll have another talk
with Deputy Chief Johnson.

19:03.588 --> 19:04.828
Uh, no, no.

19:04.858 --> 19:05.678
Thank you, sir.

19:05.717 --> 19:08.428
I'm pursuing a different angle with her,

19:08.468 --> 19:11.297
and i'd like the opportunity
to give that a shot.

19:11.338 --> 19:12.567
All right.

19:12.587 --> 19:14.018
- Let me know if you need me.
- Thank you.

19:14.048 --> 19:15.778
- Sergeant.
- Chief.

19:15.808 --> 19:17.298
She's bringing in Dr. Jerome to observe,

19:17.328 --> 19:18.908
so you're almost ready, sir?

19:18.948 --> 19:21.548
Sir, huh? What, you
want to borrow money?

19:21.598 --> 19:23.118
Yeah, look, i brought in all the names

19:23.148 --> 19:25.368
from the phone dump, like she asked.

19:25.388 --> 19:27.868
Plus some high school
junior Dr. Rainey put on

19:27.888 --> 19:31.708
the university no-admit list
for dealing pot, Eric Placton.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.918
Mr. Placton was a little
more reluctant to stop by.

19:34.948 --> 19:37.098
Put Sanchez through hell.

19:37.118 --> 19:40.318
So... You're welcome.

19:41.928 --> 19:43.767
Hey, lieutenant.

19:44.307 --> 19:47.287
It's what she wanted, not me.

19:47.347 --> 19:48.768
Yeah?

19:50.547 --> 19:52.517
Well, you keep telling
yourself that, Gabriel,

19:52.567 --> 19:56.605
and maybe it'll begin
to sound believable.

20:04.189 --> 20:07.208
Schiller family, please follow me.

20:08.612 --> 20:10.779
Have a seat.

20:10.849 --> 20:13.297
Make yourself comfortable.

20:14.962 --> 20:17.469
Chief called, said we should
start the interviews right away.

20:17.499 --> 20:19.295
What happened to you?

20:19.355 --> 20:21.181
We had a runner.

20:21.241 --> 20:23.297
And i don't run.

20:25.323 --> 20:27.380
It was hard getting
her out of the study.

20:27.420 --> 20:31.924
The doctors had to slowly lower her
dosage until they felt safe letting her go.

20:32.826 --> 20:34.391
Why'd you drop out?

20:34.421 --> 20:35.996
Mother wanted me in rehab.

20:36.046 --> 20:38.905
I tested positive for pot!

20:38.965 --> 20:41.022
So Dr. Rainey kicked
you out of the study.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.727
It's a program for drug-abusing kids.

20:42.747 --> 20:44.832
I didn't care. I was
getting the placebo anyway.

20:44.862 --> 20:46.156
You didn't care?

20:46.186 --> 20:48.333
He had to call security
to get you to leave.

20:48.363 --> 20:50.570
He yelled at me, i yelled back.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.820
But you were calling Dr. Rainey
almost every day for a while.

20:53.850 --> 20:56.097
Were you mad at him?

20:56.227 --> 20:57.802
No.

20:57.822 --> 20:59.979
I just wanted back in the drug trial.

20:59.999 --> 21:02.998
So why did you keep coming back on
campus? Why did you keep calling him?

21:03.148 --> 21:04.854
Dude, i was selling, ok?

21:04.894 --> 21:07.602
Rainey put me on a
no-admit list. I wanted off.

21:07.652 --> 21:08.605
I'm a dealer.

21:08.645 --> 21:11.845
He made it hard for me to do business.

21:11.895 --> 21:15.787
Oh, so you had a problem with him?

21:16.509 --> 21:18.094
I never had a problem with the medicine.

21:18.134 --> 21:20.010
No side effects.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.006
It completely changed my life.

21:22.026 --> 21:23.852
She's stayed drug-free.

21:23.892 --> 21:26.079
We don't see the depression anymore.

21:27.222 --> 21:28.907
She's even started dating again.

21:28.947 --> 21:30.663
I'm not ready to talk
about that yet, mother.

21:30.703 --> 21:32.659
You knifed another boy.

21:32.699 --> 21:35.102
I got pissed off at this kid.
I was high.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.353
Somebody must've pulled
some strings for this boy,

21:37.373 --> 21:38.908
because we weed out kids like him.

21:38.938 --> 21:40.599
I mean, he should never have
been in the study at all.

21:40.735 --> 21:44.665
The day Rainey died, campus
security caught you on tape.

21:44.696 --> 21:46.088
I sneak in every day.

21:46.118 --> 21:48.206
I go where my customers are.

21:48.236 --> 21:50.989
Dr. Rainey didn't want me to
see my boyfriend anymore, either.

21:51.030 --> 21:53.404
What did Dr. Rainey have
against your boyfriend?

21:53.455 --> 21:56.279
When you're that old,
you forget, i think,

21:56.311 --> 21:58.757
what it's like to be in love.

21:58.828 --> 22:00.834
And the wonderful thing is,

22:00.865 --> 22:03.035
if he hadn't put me in the study,

22:03.086 --> 22:05.368
i wouldn't even have known
how to care about someone else.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.921
This medication changed my life.

22:10.970 --> 22:13.339
So are you going to hold
me? How's this going to go?

22:13.399 --> 22:16.987
You never read me my rights. You
don't got crap on drug charges.

22:19.386 --> 22:20.714
Ok.

22:21.348 --> 22:23.669
We'll be back in a minute.

22:24.907 --> 22:26.444
Why don't you just sit here and wait,

22:26.493 --> 22:29.472
you little freak.

22:30.026 --> 22:33.295
Dr. Rainey's wife warned her
husband about kids like Eric.

22:33.325 --> 22:35.260
Well, Leah Rainey works
with juvenile offenders.

22:35.290 --> 22:38.108
I mean, she sees the
worst kids in the city.

22:40.906 --> 22:41.807
Lord have mercy.

22:41.868 --> 22:45.267
Dr. Jerome, could you please wait
outside for me in the hallway?

22:45.297 --> 22:46.981
Thank you so much.

22:47.232 --> 22:48.361
There oughta be a law.

22:48.396 --> 22:50.230
You all look like a bunch
of dentists in a strip club.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.496
Out! Out!

22:52.968 --> 22:56.988
And if you can't book our little drug
dealer on possession, get him out of here.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.425
She's 16 years old!

23:03.455 --> 23:05.269
Ok, ok.

23:05.610 --> 23:08.821
I'm so ashamed.

23:24.241 --> 23:27.270
Any updates on our ethics inquiry?

23:27.300 --> 23:31.079
Three georgia newspapers,
big fat headlines,

23:31.119 --> 23:34.458
"Sexual misconduct" in bold print,

23:34.538 --> 23:36.028
but no specifics.

23:36.078 --> 23:37.708
That sucks.

23:37.757 --> 23:39.198
Here.

23:40.847 --> 23:44.426
I'm gonna shoot this to a buddy
of mine at the metro section.

23:44.446 --> 23:46.076
You're e-mailing a reporter?

23:46.106 --> 23:49.775
Hey, you wanna dig through
the dirt, get yourself a worm.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.863
Have a seat.

24:11.926 --> 24:13.446
Fritz!

24:13.446 --> 24:14.846
Here you go.

24:16.757 --> 24:17.616
It's lovely.

24:17.636 --> 24:20.007
It's a little house-warming present.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.767
Ah, well, see, now i'm embarrassed.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.077
It doesn't go with your boxes.

24:28.408 --> 24:30.388
You forgot, didn't you?

24:30.408 --> 24:31.508
What?

24:31.568 --> 24:34.098
We're going to the movies tonight.

24:34.359 --> 24:36.049
Right. Oh, no.

24:36.078 --> 24:38.699
I, uh, i remembered that. I just..

24:38.729 --> 24:40.869
forgot to call and cancel.

24:40.899 --> 24:43.480
You must have a case the
F.B.I. can't help you with, huh?

24:43.509 --> 24:45.370
Oh, you sound mad.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.030
I'm mad a little.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.040
Oh, look, you know...

24:49.070 --> 24:53.690
This has nothing to do with the fact i just
gave you a beautiful, rare, expensive plant,

24:53.720 --> 24:55.281
and you forgot i was coming.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.041
You make it sound so awful.

24:57.071 --> 24:59.622
I just like you, Brenda, but
i don't want to force things.

24:59.751 --> 25:01.982
I don't want to pressure you.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.182
You know, like..

25:04.252 --> 25:07.212
i mean, do you ever
even go to the movies?

25:07.282 --> 25:08.962
I don't know.

25:09.002 --> 25:12.642
How long ago was "Fried Green Tomatoes"?

25:12.682 --> 25:16.342
You see, that's what i mean. I don't want to
put you through something you don't want to do,

25:16.602 --> 25:21.153
like dating, so, look, if this is
gonna be it, then that's.. that's fine.

25:21.283 --> 25:21.983
It'll be this.

25:22.012 --> 25:24.023
We'll agree to be friends.

25:24.063 --> 25:25.793
Ok?

25:26.513 --> 25:28.704
Friends.

25:29.093 --> 25:30.084
Ok.

25:30.123 --> 25:32.324
Friends. This is good.

25:46.176 --> 25:48.735
Excuse me just one minute.

25:50.186 --> 25:52.216
Oh, sergeant Gabriel.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.297
Really? When?

25:55.357 --> 25:59.327
Are you sure that it was Dr.
Jerome's office and not Dr. Rainey's?

26:00.607 --> 26:03.357
Which files did he say were stolen?

26:03.408 --> 26:05.538
How far away are you?

26:12.829 --> 26:16.718
Sergeant Gabriel, this is
special agent Fritz Howard, F.B.I.

26:16.759 --> 26:17.618
Dave Gabriel.

26:17.658 --> 26:18.998
So, um...

26:19.039 --> 26:22.138
Sorry, we'll just pick up in a few days,

26:22.178 --> 26:24.799
and, um...I'll call you.

26:24.828 --> 26:26.158
Ok.

26:26.849 --> 26:28.759
Oh. Right.

26:28.790 --> 26:29.679
So we're all going now?

26:29.719 --> 26:31.880
Yes, we're all going.

26:31.949 --> 26:35.100
Well, thank you, chief.

26:35.140 --> 26:35.890
Thank you.

26:35.910 --> 26:37.030
Nice to meet you, sergeant.

26:37.070 --> 26:39.030
Special agent Howard.

26:39.831 --> 26:40.793
Chief.

26:44.906 --> 26:46.669
If i didn't have so much
child support to pay,

26:46.689 --> 26:49.534
they could screw this overtime bullshit.

26:49.574 --> 26:51.356
I'm not kidding.

26:51.406 --> 26:53.220
The door's clean and the
windows haven't been touched.

26:53.260 --> 26:54.522
There's no forcible entry.

26:54.552 --> 26:58.798
The chief wants a complete
S.I.D. work-up anyway.

27:00.130 --> 27:02.625
They didn't just make off with the
records for the clinical trials.

27:02.675 --> 27:05.028
They also took my book
proposal, my laptop...

27:05.058 --> 27:06.491
Don't touch anything.

27:06.531 --> 27:07.763
Please, doctor.

27:07.813 --> 27:09.556
What happens to the study now?

27:09.595 --> 27:11.599
Well, Curson has copies of all our work,

27:11.628 --> 27:14.173
and now they have real
exclusivity on the data.

27:14.203 --> 27:16.787
I mean, unless i could get
permission to take Alan's files,

27:16.817 --> 27:18.660
they'll just get someone
else to write the abstract

27:18.700 --> 27:23.617
and make their antidepressant sound
like the second coming or something.

27:24.037 --> 27:27.343
Tell me, Miss Johnson, why would
one of the kids do this to me?

27:27.383 --> 27:28.375
I don't know.

27:28.395 --> 27:30.528
I don't... I don't know.

27:30.547 --> 27:31.910
Excuse me.

27:44.530 --> 27:45.322
Can i help you, madam?

27:45.352 --> 27:48.125
Yes. Has anyone come this way tonight?

27:48.196 --> 27:50.369
No, madam, not a soul.

28:08.418 --> 28:10.561
Did you do your homework
on Dr. Rainey's wife?

28:10.591 --> 28:11.503
Yes, madam.

28:11.533 --> 28:14.878
We need to talk to her again
first thing in the morning.

28:26.327 --> 28:28.591
Hi, Dr. Rainey. Thank you for seeing me.

28:28.631 --> 28:30.893
I'll try to make this
as painless as possible.

28:30.923 --> 28:33.497
I appreciate that. Thank you.

28:34.459 --> 28:37.123
I just have a couple questions.

28:37.303 --> 28:40.689
Are you familiar with
the name Cody Hammond?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.200
Ordinarily i wouldn't be.

28:42.250 --> 28:45.476
Alan never violated a
patient's confidentiality,

28:45.496 --> 28:48.231
but there was a lawsuit, so, yes.

28:48.261 --> 28:52.087
And your husband never called
the Hammonds when their son died?

28:52.127 --> 28:55.702
He wanted to. He was counseled
against it by the insurance company.

28:55.742 --> 28:57.355
Malpractice issues.

28:57.395 --> 29:00.049
Nowadays just saying you're
sorry for someone's loss

29:00.089 --> 29:03.244
can be construed as
an admission of guilt.

29:03.304 --> 29:04.827
Right. I see.

29:04.867 --> 29:06.199
How you holding up? You ok?

29:06.239 --> 29:08.753
Yes. Thanks for asking.

29:08.803 --> 29:10.656
You mentioned confidentiality

29:10.686 --> 29:11.908
and how your husband
would never break it,

29:11.978 --> 29:15.413
but can you think of
any reason he might have?

29:15.453 --> 29:16.435
A legal reason?

29:16.476 --> 29:17.547
To the authorities?

29:17.597 --> 29:19.120
Easily, yes.

29:19.160 --> 29:20.792
For example, working with teenagers,

29:20.832 --> 29:24.328
i frequently uncover cases
involving sex with a minor

29:24.358 --> 29:25.360
or child molestation.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.884
I'm required to report those.

29:27.924 --> 29:30.427
But there are other exceptions, too.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.151
Such as?

29:32.310 --> 29:36.005
If a patient admits that they are
planning to commit a serious felony

29:36.046 --> 29:38.810
like murder, privilege goes away.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.083
You call the police.

29:41.143 --> 29:44.649
So say one of the teenagers in the study
opened up to your husband about a crime.

29:44.769 --> 29:46.492
How could i access that file?

29:46.542 --> 29:49.987
Privilege belongs to the patient or
in this case, their legal guardians.

29:50.178 --> 29:52.271
Do you even know who these kids are?

29:53.023 --> 29:55.006
Only a few.

29:55.516 --> 29:57.518
And then there's Curson.

29:57.548 --> 30:00.397
They could help, but they won't.

30:00.567 --> 30:04.780
It's really all a... mess, isn't it?

30:04.810 --> 30:06.255
Do you mind? Are we done?

30:06.295 --> 30:08.592
This is.. it's been
very hard, and, um...

30:08.642 --> 30:09.795
i have no one to cover
for me here today, so...

30:09.836 --> 30:12.022
I think we have enough. Thank you.

30:13.597 --> 30:15.202
Thank you.

30:18.081 --> 30:20.709
Could they have put sexual
misconduct in any bigger type?

30:20.739 --> 30:21.882
The writer says his source

30:21.923 --> 30:24.892
is a high-ranking officer
close to the chief's office.

30:24.932 --> 30:25.915
Well, you know it wasn't me,

30:25.945 --> 30:28.352
because i know the
whole thing was bogus.

30:28.954 --> 30:30.820
Ah! And who is this
weird-looking woman in the photo?

30:30.860 --> 30:33.628
It's me, Will. It's me. Thanks.

30:33.739 --> 30:35.695
Well, it's just a terrible picture.

30:36.206 --> 30:39.236
Look, a lot of people
could've leaked that story.

30:39.266 --> 30:42.234
Didn't you tell me that jerk
from Curson was threatening you?

30:42.264 --> 30:43.578
Well, you're questioning their ethics.

30:43.598 --> 30:45.213
Maybe they're returning the favor.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.664
Reporters disguise their
sources all the time.

30:54.381 --> 30:55.535
This wouldn't be the first time

30:55.575 --> 30:58.875
someone we're investigating fought back
by trying to hurt one of our detectives.

30:58.915 --> 31:01.212
Do i look hurt to you, Will?

31:01.252 --> 31:02.151
No.

31:02.186 --> 31:05.194
If i'm not mistaken,
that's your angry face.

31:07.251 --> 31:10.842
Look, the internal affairs investigation
of your conduct in Atlanta happened.

31:10.882 --> 31:12.567
It's a fact of life.

31:12.607 --> 31:15.335
And regardless of how wrong
the details in this story are,

31:15.355 --> 31:16.840
whoever leaked it,

31:16.870 --> 31:19.548
sex was at the center of it,

31:19.598 --> 31:23.229
as it is with most things.

31:28.636 --> 31:29.609
Sorry to interrupt,

31:29.649 --> 31:31.956
but that good-looking
girl we had here yesterday,

31:31.996 --> 31:33.180
- Gretchen Schiller.
- Yes.

31:33.220 --> 31:36.400
She was just rushed to the
hospital with convulsions.

31:38.376 --> 31:40.181
Where's sergeant Gabriel?

31:40.944 --> 31:44.424
As you know, we have an understanding,
which is pretty much in your agreement.

31:44.475 --> 31:46.110
Excuse me, Dr. Dawson.

31:46.150 --> 31:49.319
Mr. and Mrs. Schiller,
Brenda Leigh Johnson, L.A.P.D.

31:49.499 --> 31:52.147
Can i talk to you for a
moment over here, please?

31:52.167 --> 31:53.712
What the hell are you doing here?

31:53.742 --> 31:56.290
Priority homicide. Checking on
the health of an important witness

31:56.320 --> 31:58.095
in the murder
investigation of Dr. Rainey,

31:58.135 --> 32:01.245
and if you interfere, i'll take
you outside and arrest your ass.

32:01.275 --> 32:03.672
How's that for what we're doing here?

32:05.327 --> 32:07.584
They... they say her
brain isn't working,

32:07.625 --> 32:10.935
that she may be in a coma for...

32:10.965 --> 32:14.195
They said no cortical function.

32:14.235 --> 32:15.960
That's what the doctor said.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.799
Like... like she could be brain dead.

32:18.839 --> 32:22.209
And she took her medicine
last night. I saw her.

32:22.249 --> 32:23.102
Right.

32:23.132 --> 32:25.559
But the doctor said they can't
find any in her blood work.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.498
Does that make any sense to you?

32:29.130 --> 32:31.869
It's beginning to, yes.

32:43.649 --> 32:44.500
Mrs. Johnson?

32:44.550 --> 32:45.761
Yes.

32:46.441 --> 32:47.742
Doctor.

32:47.782 --> 32:48.934
You were right.

32:48.953 --> 32:51.235
The lab missed your compound
the first time around

32:51.265 --> 32:53.977
because she was taking an inactive
form of the antidepressant.

32:54.007 --> 32:54.877
Inactive?

32:54.917 --> 32:55.907
She was getting the placebo.

32:55.947 --> 32:56.928
No, she wasn't.

32:56.968 --> 32:58.649
No, she was taking the medication,

32:58.678 --> 33:02.181
and Dr. Jerome told us
that we had to be careful.

33:02.211 --> 33:05.204
We made damn sure she took her medicine

33:05.244 --> 33:07.115
because of what happened to that boy.

33:07.134 --> 33:09.517
Tell him. Tell him we were
helping our daughter. Please.

33:09.607 --> 33:12.018
What happened to Gretchen
is not your fault.

33:12.059 --> 33:13.579
Excuse me. I'll be in touch.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.341
Pardon me.

33:17.492 --> 33:19.544
I never had a problem with the medicine.

33:19.574 --> 33:21.476
No side effects.

33:21.496 --> 33:23.757
It completely changed my life.

33:23.797 --> 33:25.729
She stayed drug-free.

33:25.768 --> 33:28.620
We don't see the depression anymore.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.763
She's even started dating again.

33:30.793 --> 33:31.624
Stop, please.

33:31.653 --> 33:33.705
I'm not ready to talk about...

33:35.196 --> 33:36.217
Gretchen's mother was right.

33:36.257 --> 33:38.718
She was taking the medication.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.351
Play our little drug
dealer's tape, please.

33:42.381 --> 33:44.562
So Dr. Rainey kicked
you out of the study.

33:44.603 --> 33:46.444
It's a program for drug-abusing kids.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.986
I didn't care. I was
getting the placebo anyway.

33:49.015 --> 33:50.527
You didn't care?

33:50.567 --> 33:52.238
Freeze it.

33:57.501 --> 34:00.874
I was concentrating on the wrong person.

34:01.344 --> 34:03.845
Fast forward Gretchen, please.

34:06.407 --> 34:07.667
Stop!

34:07.718 --> 34:08.608
Play.

34:08.648 --> 34:11.060
Dr. Rainey didn't want me to
see my boyfriend anymore, either.

34:11.110 --> 34:13.362
And what did Dr. Rainey
have against your boyfriend?

34:13.391 --> 34:14.862
Stop.

34:17.614 --> 34:19.496
Um, sergeant Gabriel,

34:19.525 --> 34:21.398
I'm going to need Gretchen
Schiller's cell phone, please,

34:21.418 --> 34:24.619
and i want to see your
notes from your interview

34:24.650 --> 34:26.400
with Dr. Rainey's wife.

34:26.431 --> 34:27.712
Yes, madam.

34:27.742 --> 34:29.203
Oh, damn it,

34:29.243 --> 34:31.905
damn it, damn it, damn it.

34:36.728 --> 34:38.860
So now you think the
files are necessary?

34:38.889 --> 34:40.571
Yes, absolutely.

34:40.610 --> 34:42.983
How long do we need to keep Dr.
Rainey's office a crime scene?

34:43.003 --> 34:44.554
Because it's costing us a fortune.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.614
You can release it now.

34:45.655 --> 34:47.395
Take the uniform off the clock.

34:47.415 --> 34:49.097
But, Brenda, when i do
that, we lose the files.

34:49.127 --> 34:50.078
Right.

34:50.098 --> 34:51.498
So you're taking them?

34:51.539 --> 34:53.139
That would be nuts, Will.

34:53.179 --> 34:54.301
All right, wait.

34:54.341 --> 34:56.012
Do you want to read the files yourself?

34:56.052 --> 34:58.764
No. No one can read the files.

34:59.274 --> 35:01.276
So you think those files,

35:01.315 --> 35:03.557
which are currently being
protected by a police officer,

35:03.587 --> 35:05.228
are the key to Dr. Rainey's murder.

35:05.248 --> 35:07.090
So you want the police officer removed

35:07.120 --> 35:08.840
so that we will lose
control over the files

35:08.860 --> 35:10.801
and you will then use the
files to make your case?

35:10.831 --> 35:12.812
Yes, exactly.

35:13.013 --> 35:16.496
And i need an ok from
the chief to wear a wire.

35:16.555 --> 35:17.377
Why?

35:17.406 --> 35:20.339
Because i can't authorize it myself.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.621
You've got one kid
in the ground already,

35:24.671 --> 35:25.802
another badly hurting.

35:25.842 --> 35:27.663
- What about the kids i've helped?
- When are you gonna get it?

35:27.713 --> 35:29.755
- Look, my medication is gonna save lives.
- Oh, right, that's...

35:29.855 --> 35:32.507
Would you doctors just
settle down, please?

35:32.537 --> 35:35.208
The hospital now thinks Gretchen's
going to make a full recovery.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.301
She's not talking yet, but eventually we'll
find out what happened with her medication,

35:38.401 --> 35:41.493
but i am still interested
in Dr. Rainey's files.

35:41.533 --> 35:42.494
They're protected.

35:42.524 --> 35:43.815
I know. Confidentiality,

35:43.845 --> 35:46.367
but i can get permission
from the patients.

35:46.387 --> 35:47.368
You don't know who they are.

35:47.398 --> 35:49.379
I'm not telling and Jerome here can't.

35:49.409 --> 35:51.260
But he can tell me the
names of the parents,

35:51.280 --> 35:53.542
and in this case, the
patients are minors.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.394
You do that, and i will
destroy you at the university,

35:57.425 --> 35:59.335
and i am dead serious.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.497
Uh-huh. Well, i guess it's a good
thing i already have tenure then.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.049
Isn't it?

36:03.118 --> 36:06.070
Look, if these parents find out
what happened to Gretchen and Cody,

36:06.100 --> 36:07.512
They're going to pull
their kids from the study,

36:07.542 --> 36:09.373
and i'm going to have
to start all over again.

36:09.412 --> 36:11.845
The study needs to end.

36:12.155 --> 36:17.087
I will sue to keep
these files confidential.

36:18.979 --> 36:22.751
If you think what happened
in Atlanta got ugly, wait.

36:25.854 --> 36:30.467
Are you sure of my giving you the names of the
parents will get you access to Alan's files?

36:30.527 --> 36:33.859
It's got to, because we're releasing
Dr. Rainey's office as a crime scene.

36:33.979 --> 36:37.482
As of tonight, Dr. Rainey's files
will be free of police protection.

36:37.572 --> 36:40.154
Dr. Dawson knows that.

36:45.338 --> 36:46.628
Lieutenant Flynn,

36:46.678 --> 36:49.430
Deputy Chief Johnson's
authorization for a wire.

36:49.450 --> 36:52.242
And i want it run through the
van and our electronics room here.

36:52.282 --> 36:53.453
Yes, sir.

36:53.483 --> 36:56.065
So you'll have to split up the squad.

36:56.135 --> 36:59.367
But you've gotten pretty
good at that, haven't you?

36:59.648 --> 37:02.509
You leak to the press again,
i'll have your stripes.

37:02.550 --> 37:04.311
Got it?

37:06.142 --> 37:08.804
Give her the authorization.
Take the night off.

37:08.844 --> 37:11.856
Let the people here do their job.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.172
We're right outside if you need us.

37:22.202 --> 37:25.505
Your voice is a little loud.
Could you turn it down, please?

37:25.605 --> 37:27.407
Do you copy that? Do you copy that?

37:27.826 --> 37:30.748
Every fascinating word.

37:31.669 --> 37:33.630
Someone's coming.

37:47.540 --> 37:50.112
Would that happen to be
Gretchen Schiller's file, doctor?

37:50.142 --> 37:52.114
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.605
Uh, yes, yes, it's Gretchen's file.

37:54.676 --> 37:57.747
I thought, when you told me that Dawson

37:57.787 --> 38:00.779
could end up with this stuff, i, uh...

38:00.810 --> 38:01.791
well, i got worried,

38:01.821 --> 38:03.391
now that i don't have
any records of my own.

38:03.422 --> 38:06.613
How was your office broken into,
doctor, with the policeman down the hall?

38:06.674 --> 38:08.815
And why would the drug
company steal your files,

38:08.845 --> 38:13.338
if they're so important and yet kill
Dr. Rainey and leave his files untouched?

38:13.748 --> 38:16.601
Uh, look, look, i think you're
getting off on the wrong track here.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.733
Really? May i be honest with you?

38:20.123 --> 38:21.514
Of course.

38:21.554 --> 38:23.895
I think you killed Dr. Rainey yourself.

38:23.915 --> 38:25.176
Because i took this file?

38:25.206 --> 38:27.047
And because of what's in it.

38:27.097 --> 38:30.540
Because it contains evidence that your friend
was about to break doctor/patient privilege

38:30.630 --> 38:33.192
as he was legally required to
do and report you to the police.

38:33.301 --> 38:34.942
Report me? I'm sorry.

38:34.982 --> 38:36.613
I'm not following your train of thought.

38:36.644 --> 38:40.277
My guess is that Dr. Rainey gave
you a chance to turn yourself in,

38:40.297 --> 38:43.048
and you paid him back by smashing
him in the head with a phone

38:43.078 --> 38:46.340
and smothering him to death
with a cushion from his sofa.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.993
Ok, now you're just sounding hysterical.

38:49.023 --> 38:50.484
Let's look at this logically

38:50.524 --> 38:53.085
and calmly, all right?

38:53.115 --> 38:55.007
If i killed Alan for this file,

38:55.057 --> 38:56.528
why wouldn't i have
taken it at the time?

38:56.558 --> 38:57.999
Because you didn't know you needed it.

38:58.039 --> 38:59.630
You didn't know how Dr. Rainey found out

38:59.660 --> 39:01.462
you were sexually abusing a minor

39:01.492 --> 39:02.812
until you were standing next to me

39:02.842 --> 39:04.674
listening to Gretchen
Schiller's interview.

39:04.704 --> 39:08.647
Ok, now you're stepping
over a big, big line.

39:08.677 --> 39:11.849
I was not having sex with Gretchen
Schiller, and she never said that.

39:11.909 --> 39:16.502
You're right. She didn't. All she said was that
she had a boyfriend Dr. Rainey wouldn't approve of.

39:16.552 --> 39:18.784
But you've got her file right there.
Why don't you open it yourself?

39:18.913 --> 39:21.236
Read your friend's notes.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.187
I can't do that.

39:23.217 --> 39:24.998
Even to prove my
innocence. It's privileged.

39:25.038 --> 39:26.440
Actually, it's not.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.011
Now that you broke into
the office and stole it,

39:29.041 --> 39:31.262
that file is evidence
in a criminal offense.

39:31.282 --> 39:33.763
I can't open it myself, but a judge can.

39:33.803 --> 39:37.386
Look, even if she did
say something like that,

39:37.436 --> 39:38.827
she's a delusional girl,

39:38.857 --> 39:42.790
a drug addict on serious medication.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.811
This thing is so amazing.

39:44.851 --> 39:47.313
Your entire relationship
with Gretchen Schiller

39:47.353 --> 39:50.385
memorialized in text messages.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.415
All right.

39:53.898 --> 39:55.849
Um, listen.

39:57.050 --> 39:59.322
What you're reading on that phone,

39:59.362 --> 40:00.653
i only responded to her like that

40:00.663 --> 40:04.035
because i was deeply, deeply
worried about what she might do

40:04.075 --> 40:05.956
if i rejected her.

40:05.996 --> 40:09.099
The patients develop crushes on
their therapists all the time.

40:09.139 --> 40:10.679
It's called transference.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.371
In this case, it's called murder.

40:12.401 --> 40:14.466
How is it murder?
You said Gretchen was getting better.

40:15.283 --> 40:16.843
I lied.

40:16.883 --> 40:19.676
She's still in a coma.

40:21.617 --> 40:22.508
And the person with whom

40:22.558 --> 40:25.210
you've been exchanging
text messages all day,

40:25.250 --> 40:27.461
explaining why you
accidentally switched out

40:27.501 --> 40:30.644
Gretchen's medication with a placebo

40:30.684 --> 40:35.407
is a 45-year-old chinese-american
detective in my office.

40:37.648 --> 40:41.080
So i'll ask you again.

40:42.371 --> 40:45.383
Do you want to read the files out loud?

40:47.024 --> 40:49.946
When i find someone who's
sexually abusing a minor,

40:49.986 --> 40:52.788
i usually find it's part of a pattern.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.740
You did say you
specialized in adolescents,

40:54.780 --> 40:56.841
didn't you, doctor?

40:56.881 --> 40:58.882
How closely do you study them?

40:58.913 --> 41:00.294
Do you think if i go looking,

41:00.324 --> 41:03.236
i'll find other teenage girls
with transference issues?

41:03.276 --> 41:04.626
That's the psychological term.

41:04.656 --> 41:07.288
In law enforcement, we
call it statutory rape!

41:07.308 --> 41:09.590
All right, all right, i
have never raped anyone.

41:09.610 --> 41:11.251
Maybe you prefer to
think of it as molesting.

41:11.282 --> 41:12.702
Is that what gets you off, doctor?

41:12.732 --> 41:14.584
How many little girls
are we talking about?

41:14.614 --> 41:15.434
You know, child molesters...

41:15.464 --> 41:17.666
It's not molesting!

41:18.596 --> 41:21.049
They come to me.

41:21.089 --> 41:22.379
That's it. Let's do it.

41:22.419 --> 41:24.100
I am telling you the complete truth.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.362
And they're not little girls, ok?

41:26.412 --> 41:28.224
Biologically, they're young women.

41:28.254 --> 41:29.414
And they ask me.

41:29.464 --> 41:31.035
I have never seduced
a single one of them!

41:31.075 --> 41:33.237
They asked me!

41:34.277 --> 41:37.120
You know, i think we
just had a breakthrough.

41:37.199 --> 41:39.672
Unfortunately, that's all
the time we have for today.

41:39.711 --> 41:41.903
We'll pick up here again in
our next session together.

41:41.943 --> 41:43.153
Ok?

41:44.565 --> 41:47.186
Get him out of here.

41:49.937 --> 41:51.989
Let's go.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.872
So why don't you just ask me about it?

41:55.902 --> 41:58.003
I know what you're thinking.

41:59.024 --> 42:03.607
Ok, i did read the article
about your ethics investigation.

42:04.118 --> 42:07.720
and you were wondering what
all the hoopla was about?

42:07.760 --> 42:10.212
Well, it's none of my business,

42:10.242 --> 42:13.674
really, but, yeah.

42:16.586 --> 42:17.937
Ok.

42:17.967 --> 42:19.439
Here we go.

42:19.488 --> 42:21.050
Spill your guts.

42:21.090 --> 42:23.771
It was my crazy ex-husband...

42:23.801 --> 42:25.573
Lieutenant, this is making
me really uncomfortable.

42:25.613 --> 42:28.775
Buzz, don't make me pull out my gun.

42:29.645 --> 42:32.668
Things were not going
well with us and...

42:32.698 --> 42:35.360
he thought it couldn't
possibly be just him.

42:35.390 --> 42:36.791
I mean, it had to be another guy,

42:36.820 --> 42:40.143
so he decided that i
was having an affair

42:40.193 --> 42:43.035
with a younger officer in my precinct

42:43.065 --> 42:47.719
and he reported me to
my superiors and, um...

42:47.749 --> 42:53.742
it went to internal affairs and i was
investigated for sexual misconduct.

42:56.174 --> 42:58.475
Sir, really, this has got
to be against the rules.

42:58.495 --> 43:02.388
But it's not against the law.
We've got a permit for this wire.

43:02.868 --> 43:04.469
And?

43:04.960 --> 43:06.211
Come on.

43:06.261 --> 43:11.435
It was all a big fat lie
and the charges were dropped.

43:15.247 --> 43:16.698
That must've been hard.

43:16.738 --> 43:19.760
Yeah, it was hard. It was hard, yeah,

43:19.790 --> 43:24.884
especially since there was a
little truth in it, you know,

43:24.924 --> 43:28.276
cause i did find him attractive.

43:28.316 --> 43:30.968
See? See? When will you
ever learn to trust me?

43:30.998 --> 43:33.250
This is about to get really good.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.031
You know, in a kind
of animal kind of way.

43:36.061 --> 43:38.743
Why don't we just change the subject?

43:38.764 --> 43:42.306
Just for a second.

43:47.059 --> 43:48.780
Hello.

43:48.851 --> 43:50.222
Who is this guy?

43:50.252 --> 43:52.814
Why don't we have pictures?

44:05.802 --> 44:08.784
Oh, god! Oh, god.

44:08.824 --> 44:11.396
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.

44:11.436 --> 44:13.427
We're already up to "oh, god"?

44:14.708 --> 44:17.821
Oh, god, oh, god. Sorry.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.892
Sorry.

44:30.349 --> 44:31.755
Damn.
