WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.049
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:06.093 --> 00:07.398
- So I got
your trash bag for you.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.052
Yeah, I figured
I'll hold on to it for a bit.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.923
- Who are you protecting,
you or me?

00:10.967 --> 00:12.664
- I want you done.
- It's over.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.188
- Which part?
- All of it.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.320
Bring the children home, okay?

00:16.364 --> 00:18.235
- How did they even know
about the pills?

00:18.279 --> 00:20.063
- Or exactly where
to look for them?

00:20.107 --> 00:22.587
- Someone said something.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.286
- Did you remove a pen cap
from the evidence locker?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.852
- You're not going away
for this.

00:26.896 --> 00:28.071
We'll get you a real lawyer.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.203
- You know how much that costs?

00:29.246 --> 00:30.595
- So how we gonna do this?

00:33.207 --> 00:34.425
- I took it all out.

00:34.469 --> 00:35.861
- Oh, my God.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.299
You left our payday
in a trash can?

00:38.342 --> 00:40.083
- You do whatever you want
whenever you want...

00:40.127 --> 00:41.432
- I take risks, Ruby.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.130
- Without thinking about
anyone else but yourself.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.870
- What are you doing here?

00:44.914 --> 00:46.785
- I tried calling.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.004
- I blocked your number.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.788
- You don't gotta know
about this, then.

00:49.832 --> 00:50.833
- Where are the books?

00:50.876 --> 00:52.226
- Uh, they--
they're in accounting.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.750
- Not those books,
the book club books.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.187
- FBI!
- Everybody down.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.362
Where is she?

00:58.406 --> 00:59.537
Mrs. Boland,

00:59.581 --> 01:01.104
we're gonna need you
to come out now.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.760
Lot's clean.
- They knew we were coming.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.774
- Kenny, now!

01:20.428 --> 01:22.343
- How'd you know
they were coming?

01:23.996 --> 01:25.302
- I didn't.

01:25.346 --> 01:28.044
I just stopped in
to go over promos with Linda

01:28.088 --> 01:29.741
and I saw all those cars,
like, a block away--

01:29.785 --> 01:31.134
all those FBI guys.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.875
- That is some Spidey sense.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.312
- Or lucky, like you said.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.748
- Yeah.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.762
So...

01:50.806 --> 01:53.939
did he call or text?

01:59.510 --> 02:00.685
- Check my phone.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.557
- It's weird, 'cause...

02:02.600 --> 02:05.603
Janey saw you
in the park with him.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.260
You said you were done.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.654
- He did us a favor.
- Are you kidding me?

02:12.697 --> 02:14.351
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.700
That dealership,
do you know how long

02:15.744 --> 02:16.788
it's been in my family?
'Cause it's gone now.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.747
- Can we do this another time?

02:18.790 --> 02:21.141
- Hey, honey?

02:21.184 --> 02:23.969
Give this to your mom.
- Thank you.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.884
- We had a deal, Beth.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.103
- We still do.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.629
- My slime kit came!

02:31.673 --> 02:34.980
- You're gonna be late
for school.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.982
- Can you open it?
Please, please.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.375
- Okay, but then I want you
in the car.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.769
I'm serious. And, you guys,
grab your backpacks.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.992
- Can I see?
Can I see?

02:48.516 --> 02:50.518
- We're gonna do slime later.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.825
- Kenny, I got your backpack!
Let's go!

02:55.262 --> 02:57.046
Come on. Chop-chop.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.440
Let's go.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.486
- And you get 10% off
your next purchase.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.184
- Well, thank you.
- Yay, you.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.794
- Here you go.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.230
- Thank you very much.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.627
- Hey, uh, can you cover
for me?

03:12.670 --> 03:14.106
- Where you going?

03:14.150 --> 03:16.326
- Home. I don't feel well.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.545
- Oh, I would,
but, uh,

03:17.588 --> 03:19.329
I gotta organize
the meat freezer.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.765
It's getting crowded again.

03:20.809 --> 03:23.159
Hunting season.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.856
Since when do we hunt
our own meat, anyway?

03:24.900 --> 03:27.555
What is it, like,
a weird farm-to-table thing?

03:27.598 --> 03:30.122
- No, um, it's a service
we offer the community.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.342
Anyone can store
their meat in there for a fee.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.649
And if you want,
Karl will butcher it.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.259
No charge.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.001
- Good to know.
That's totally disgusting.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.221
Coffee filters are 25% off

03:41.264 --> 03:43.875
until 10:00 tomorrow.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.268
- Hmm.
Hey.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.356
- Hey, pal.
How--how are you?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.271
- Oh, hey!
- Hi.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.317
Are you okay?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.580
- Fine, yeah.
Fine.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.019
- Need a break?

03:57.062 --> 03:58.716
- Not really.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.503
- You want to tell me
what's going on?

04:02.546 --> 04:05.288
- Nothing.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.551
- You've been avoiding me.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.950
I don't know
if I can do this.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.735
- Well, that's not nothing.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.782
- Well, I-I didn't know
how to tell you.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.088
- So you--you just waited
for me to take the hint?

04:23.132 --> 04:26.222
- I'm sorry.
I'm not good at breaking up.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.485
- Wait, we're breaking up?

04:28.529 --> 04:31.271
- Well, I don't know.
I...

04:31.314 --> 04:33.751
- Well, that's not nothing.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.627
- I just need
to figure some things out.

04:43.979 --> 04:45.676
- I think I just got dumped.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.723
- What'd she say?

04:48.766 --> 04:51.465
- That she has
to figure stuff out.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.771
- Yeah, brother,
you got dumped.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.341
What is that?

04:58.385 --> 05:02.302
- Mrs. Boland left a page
from her ledger.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.573
- Okay, here's what
you're gonna do.

05:12.616 --> 05:13.791
You're gonna buy yourself
a pint,

05:13.835 --> 05:17.360
something shameful like Oreo
or cookie dough.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.666
- Go to hell, man.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.624
- Then you're gonna watch
"Fault in Our Stars."

05:20.668 --> 05:21.799
- Oh, I already
read the book.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.497
- Anything to get
the tears flowing, okay?

05:23.540 --> 05:25.237
- Mm.
- Then you just gotta

05:25.281 --> 05:27.109
flush her out.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.589
- You're a dick.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.938
- And maybe if you stopped
thinking with yours,

05:29.981 --> 05:32.244
we'd have more to go off of
than a scrap of paper.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.684
We still need her.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.687
- I'm cool with her kid.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.036
- Then do that.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.476
And do this too.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.827
- You're paying
for the ice cream.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.177
- Gladly.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.179
- We should be okay
until tomorrow.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.398
- Yeah.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.275
- Coffee?

06:03.319 --> 06:04.407
- Oh--
- Sure.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.495
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.889
- Starbucks, Great Lakes,
or Astro?

06:08.890 --> 06:10.892
- Just, uh, tap.

06:11.806 --> 06:12.807
- I'm sorry?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.678
- Oh, you know,
from the pot's fine.

06:16.027 --> 06:19.422
- We have a runner who will
get you anything you want.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.121
- Um...
- Uh...

06:23.165 --> 06:25.036
- Cappuccino's fine.
- PSL.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.734
- This is a joke, right?

06:27.691 --> 06:29.693
- Well, I'm sorry
to waste your time.

06:29.737 --> 06:32.000
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
it's this case.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.610
This is hilarious.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.177
This thing ought to have
its own set

06:35.220 --> 06:36.570
down at the Comedy Castle.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.050
I mean, they haven't offered
one single argument here

06:39.094 --> 06:40.574
that isn't laughable.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.880
- W-we didn't
find it funny.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.447
- Okay.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.449
So they're charging you
with evidence tampering, right?

06:47.624 --> 06:50.845
You ever heard of something
called chain of custody?

06:50.888 --> 06:52.281
- Um, yeah.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.282
- Is that good or bad?

06:53.325 --> 06:54.675
- Good, 'cause this pen cap

06:54.718 --> 06:55.980
that they're saying
you took?

06:56.024 --> 06:58.592
It's been through
so many undocumented hands,

06:58.635 --> 07:02.073
you're just as guilty as
anybody else in that station.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.512
- So you think
you can get him off?

07:05.555 --> 07:07.905
- I can and I will get him off.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.690
Happy birthday.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.171
So all we'll need

07:13.215 --> 07:15.739
is a signed letter
of engagement

07:15.783 --> 07:19.569
and we will deliver some pain.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.397
- It says here, um,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.573
you require a retainer
before service?

07:23.617 --> 07:25.880
- Yes, yes.
We bill our time against it.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.664
It's just to streamline
our accounting.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.361
But as soon
as we get the check,

07:29.405 --> 07:30.450
we'll get started.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.234
- And, um, how much
is that retainer?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.018
- Ten grand.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.151
- Hmm, okay.

07:38.501 --> 07:41.112
- Didn't know
if you wanted whip on the PSL,

07:41.156 --> 07:42.287
so you got both.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.985
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.979
- Ew.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.505
Okay.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.378
- That's a white boy's thumb.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.423
- Could be a toe.

08:31.467 --> 08:33.513
- That's not a toe.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.515
- 'Cause I suggested it?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.255
- Because it has hair on it.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.996
- Yeah, like a big toe.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.737
- Guys.
- You have hair on your toe?

08:40.781 --> 08:42.522
- Like you don't.
- I am not a hobbit.

08:42.565 --> 08:43.958
- It's evolutionary.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.655
People have to have
a tiny bit of fur left from--

08:45.699 --> 08:47.657
- Whatever, Frodo.
- Guys.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.052
It's Boomer.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.880
I mean, it has to be, right?

08:55.056 --> 08:56.100
- I don't know.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.581
Don't look at me; I don't know
what his toe looks like.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.887
- You know what his thumb
looks like?

09:01.758 --> 09:04.108
- Well, it's clearly personal.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.982
He wants me back.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.767
- I mean, there's nicer ways
of saying it, gang friend.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.334
- I blocked his number.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.814
- Greeting card,

09:13.857 --> 09:16.294
I mean, e-card,
an edible arrangement.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.035
- So what are you gonna do?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.140
He needs to get over it.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.410
- ♪ Who's that I see

11:48.969 --> 11:50.187
- Wait.
- Yeah.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.667
- W-why do you have--

11:51.711 --> 11:53.800
- Because now we have
to work off a debt.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.280
Apparently,
two budding entrepreneurs

11:56.324 --> 11:59.414
took it upon themselves
to go on a pill run

11:59.457 --> 12:02.243
but didn't deliver the pills.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.986
- Guess whose fault that was.
- Don't even start with me.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.857
- So you went behind my back...

12:07.901 --> 12:09.816
again.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.992
- To be fair--
- We needed the money.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
- And you said you were out.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.212
- You know how much
a real lawyer costs?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.127
Like, 11,000 doughnuts.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.694
- Have you ever had
a lemon rind

12:18.738 --> 12:21.218
stuck in your garbage disposal?

12:21.262 --> 12:24.047
It goes round and round

12:24.091 --> 12:26.049
and jacks up all the blades.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.009
Turns out, so does an ear.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.359
- Jesus.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.230
I mean, how much
of him is left?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.189
- Enough to send to the cops

12:35.232 --> 12:38.192
if we don't, as he put it,

12:38.235 --> 12:40.585
"Do what you do."

12:40.629 --> 12:43.806
- But I mean--
I mean, what about the FBI?

12:43.850 --> 12:45.068
- What about the FBI?

12:45.112 --> 12:47.767
- Well, I mean,
what if they're watching us?

12:47.810 --> 12:51.118
I mean, I don't know that
they're literally watching us,

12:51.161 --> 12:52.380
but, you know,

12:52.423 --> 12:53.642
after what happened
with the raid,

12:53.685 --> 12:57.385
they--they could be
watching some of us...

12:57.428 --> 12:58.865
or one of us...

12:58.908 --> 13:01.476
or none of us.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.478
Let's move on.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.133
- How does he expect us
to wash this much cash

13:06.176 --> 13:08.439
without the cars or Costco?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.749
- What do common criminals do?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.273
You know what I mean.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.289
- ♪ What you looking

Hey.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.337

15:03.380 --> 15:05.165
- Do you, uh,
want to order a pizza?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.383
I'm too tired to cook.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.515
- You don't cook.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.473
- Well, then can you call?

15:09.517 --> 15:12.041
Because I'm too tired to dial.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.564
- Sure.
- Ugh.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.971
- What's so funny?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.886
- Someone taught a parrot
to burp.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.366
- I mean, is it
actually burping,

15:32.409 --> 15:35.021
or is it just imitating
a human burp?

15:35.064 --> 15:37.545
- I'll ask Noah.

15:37.588 --> 15:38.763
- Wait, what?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.505
- He tagged me on the parrot.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.725
- What do you mean,
he tagged you on the parrot?

15:43.768 --> 15:46.467
- I mean he DM'd me.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.209
- Wait, when are you guys
DM buddies?

15:49.252 --> 15:51.341
- Why do you care?

15:51.385 --> 15:54.257
- I just don't want you
DM'ing him.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.911
- Fine, I'll text.

15:55.955 --> 16:00.002
- Hey, I don't want you
anything-ing him, okay?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.572
- What did you do?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.269
- What do you mean?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.141
- You always do this.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.316
- Sadie, no--

16:09.359 --> 16:11.405
- Whenever you find
someone normal--

16:11.448 --> 16:13.189
which is never--you mess it up.

16:13.233 --> 16:15.757
- Look, it's not--
it's not like that, okay?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.193
- He's cool.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.586
Well, I'll find someone cooler.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.979
- I like him.
- Well, I'm sorry,

16:20.022 --> 16:22.068
but that can't always
be enough.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.808
- Why?
- Because.

16:23.852 --> 16:29.249
You know, he may not be
as normal as we think he is.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.642
- Well, now we'll never know.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.770
- Slime kit came.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.079
- Oh.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.428
Good.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.563
- Where have you been?

17:22.606 --> 17:24.826
- Just running errands.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.480
Man, I hate these ties.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.438
It breaks every single time.

17:28.482 --> 17:31.093
- Beth.
- Huh?

17:32.442 --> 17:34.836
- I don't know
what to do anymore.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.579
- I'm really trying.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.059
- Are you?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.277
- I mean, it's not
the kind of job

17:41.321 --> 17:44.106
you can just go to HR
and give your notice.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.326
- But maybe you don't
want to quit.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.893
- I do.

17:48.937 --> 17:52.071
- Then I don't think you can.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.476
I want to make it as easy
as possible for the kids.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.440
I don't want
to get lawyers involved

18:13.483 --> 18:14.615
unless, of course, you do,

18:14.658 --> 18:17.008
but we can't really
afford them, so...

18:20.621 --> 18:22.753
I gotta protect my family.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.235
- But I'm gonna get out.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.544
- Yeah.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.415
Me too.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.043
- Did you knock?

18:52.087 --> 18:55.699
- No, I usually case the joint
before I knock.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.267
- Do you wake up every day...

18:58.311 --> 19:00.835
With this much attitude,
or is it just for me?

19:00.878 --> 19:01.792
- Just you.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.011
- You want me
to say I'm sorry?

19:03.054 --> 19:06.232
I'm sorry, okay?

19:06.275 --> 19:08.190
You want me
to say it in Spanish?

19:08.234 --> 19:10.758
- I want you to say it
like you mean it.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.066
Janey!
- Hi!

19:15.110 --> 19:17.156
- Hey, uh, where's Mommy?

19:17.634 --> 19:20.028
- He'll definitely
get the kids.

19:20.071 --> 19:23.031
- Hey, you don't know that.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.991
- And the house
and the cars, this bed.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.210
- He said it won't get ugly.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.343
- It always gets ugly.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.171
- Well, that's true.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.481
- How'd you guys do?

19:40.004 --> 19:43.617
- Uh, slowish start.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.969
- I washed $400 in quarters.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.231
- Ugh.

19:49.275 --> 19:52.495
Yeah, no, I totally quit.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.932
- We're never gonna
pay it down.

19:56.282 --> 20:00.024
- If he didn't have that body,
he couldn't hold it over us.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.114
- But he does.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.771
- What if he didn't?

20:09.904 --> 20:13.429
- I'm sorry,
you want it back now?

20:13.473 --> 20:15.518
- Be hard to find.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.868
- Would it?

20:17.912 --> 20:19.957
- I don't know
where he keeps his bodies,

20:20.001 --> 20:21.655
and I don't want to know.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.788
- That guy loves
a storage facility.

20:24.832 --> 20:27.051
- You'd--you'd need
to get in first.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.575
- I need his key.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.794
- You don't even know
where he lives.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.842
- But I know where he drinks.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.599
- ♪ If I were a candle

♪ I would dance for you

22:27.258 --> 22:29.739
So this is
really embarrassing.

22:29.783 --> 22:31.567
Um...

22:31.611 --> 22:33.395
I had a little sleepover

22:33.439 --> 22:35.528
with your neighbor last night.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.051
- Mm, Brian?

22:37.094 --> 22:38.748
- Um, the other one.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.577
- Uh, Christopher, 3B?

22:42.752 --> 22:45.886
- The one with the little boy
and the--

22:45.929 --> 22:47.975
- Okay, Christopher.
- Right.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.194
We didn't really get to names.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.066
Um, but he left,

22:52.109 --> 22:54.024
and I went out in the hall
to make a phone call

22:54.068 --> 22:55.678
because I couldn't
get reception inside,

22:55.722 --> 22:58.159
and then the door locked
behind me, so...

22:58.202 --> 23:01.858
do you happen to have a key
to Christopher's apartment?

23:01.902 --> 23:03.164
- No, sorry.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.426
- Okay.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.906
Is there, like,
a super or something?

23:05.949 --> 23:07.647
'Cause I've just--
I've gotta go back in there

23:07.690 --> 23:08.822
and get my clothes

23:08.865 --> 23:10.563
and my, you know,
morning-after pill.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.391
- This is
my girlfriend's place.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.262
I don't even know.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.090
- Okay.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.527
Thanks.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.399
- You could try
the fire escape.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.662
These windows never shut.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.208
- Find what you're looking for?

25:16.384 --> 25:17.864
- No.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.433
- You want to tell me
what it is?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.001
- No.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.875
- Hmm.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.660
All right.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.357
Let's play a game, yeah?

25:33.401 --> 25:35.316
20 Questions.
I'll start.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.757
Why'd you follow me around
all day?

25:44.325 --> 25:45.935
- Was that your ex-wife?

25:45.979 --> 25:47.850
- 18.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.028
- That's not an answer,
Christopher.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.206
Why are you here?

25:58.295 --> 25:59.601
- 17.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.299
- Oh, that's not an answer,
Elizabeth.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.391
- Is this some sport to you
or some twisted hobby?

26:07.435 --> 26:09.089
- 15.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.395
- What am I supposed
to do here,

26:11.439 --> 26:14.616
buy that body back
for the rest of my life?

26:14.660 --> 26:17.837
Piece by piece, limb by limb?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.752
How much for an elbow?

26:19.795 --> 26:21.318
Any eyeball?

26:21.362 --> 26:22.929
- 8.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.410
- You're supposed to answer,
though, aren't you?

26:26.454 --> 26:27.629
Why aren't you answering?

26:27.673 --> 26:29.979
- Why are you
talking so much?

26:32.460 --> 26:35.463
- It'll take a lifetime
to wash all that money.

26:35.506 --> 26:38.118
- Yeah, that's kind of
the point.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.991
- Why are you doing this?

26:43.427 --> 26:46.692
- I mean, you came to me
way back when, right?

26:46.735 --> 26:47.910
Asking to be a part of it.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.043
Now you a part of it.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.352
- When does it end?

27:01.837 --> 27:04.013
One question left.

27:05.319 --> 27:07.364
You want it?

27:16.286 --> 27:19.376
Would you please
leave my house now?

27:39.309 --> 27:40.920
- What's that?

27:40.963 --> 27:42.704
- Oh, one of those
"choose the ending" books.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.750
- How about you choose
your homework?

27:44.793 --> 27:46.839
- My hot air balloon's on fire.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.453
- What are your options?

27:52.496 --> 27:53.846
- "Stay and try to put it out"

27:53.889 --> 27:56.457
or "jump with my dog
into the unknown below."

27:56.500 --> 27:58.285
- You don't know
what's down there.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.200
Crocodiles, clowns.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.768
- The extinguisher is empty.

28:02.811 --> 28:06.293
We exploded
into a billion pieces.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.382
- Sorry.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.907
All right, homework, baby girl.

28:18.131 --> 28:21.612
- So Daddy's going away
for a long time, huh?

28:23.789 --> 28:26.139
- Who's talking to you
like that?

28:26.182 --> 28:27.749
- Daddy.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.708
- Oh.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.232
- He said I needed
to help you out more.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.451
- What else did he say?

28:34.495 --> 28:36.323
- That it was wrong

28:36.366 --> 28:38.499
but he'd do it again.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.630
- He said that?

28:39.674 --> 28:40.893
- If he didn't
do something bad,

28:40.936 --> 28:43.112
something worse
would have happened.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.078
- Go back and see what happens
if you jump.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.458
Afternoon, Tara.
Starbucks, please.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.721
Chai tea latte,
oat milk, no foam,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.723
extra hot, dash of cinnamon.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.421
- Right away, Mrs. Hill.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.732
- So what'd you do
to get this much cash?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.560
Because I'm betting
that it's way worse

29:39.603 --> 29:41.388
than stealing a pen cap.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.346
- You said you needed
a retainer.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.306
- Mrs. Hill, we pride ourselves
on our reputation here.

29:46.349 --> 29:47.568
- I got you the retainer.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.178
- I can't risk
losing everything

29:49.222 --> 29:51.267
that I put into this firm.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.750
- So it's like that, then.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.369
- 20 grand to cover the risk

30:06.413 --> 30:09.329
and another ten
for our reputation.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.908
- Tell Tara
to make it a grande.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.518
- Will do.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.321
- You're right.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.544
- About what?

30:50.587 --> 30:52.285
- I can't quit.

30:53.634 --> 30:56.071
- Why?

30:57.725 --> 30:59.683
It feels good...

30:59.727 --> 31:02.948
to be really good
at something.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.213
- You're good
at the dealership too.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.696
It's not enough, is it?

31:22.097 --> 31:23.838
Does he, like...

31:23.882 --> 31:28.060
listen to you more or...

31:28.103 --> 31:31.237
you know, encourage you
in ways that I don't?

31:35.719 --> 31:38.897
- I just really like
having sex with him.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.774
Yeah.

31:48.210 --> 31:52.171
- ♪ Tell me, did the wind
sweep you off your feet ♪

31:52.214 --> 31:54.695
♪ Did you finally
get the chance to dance ♪

31:54.738 --> 31:56.871
- What is happening

31:56.915 --> 32:00.266
- Oh, now you want
to bring Train into this?

32:00.309 --> 32:01.571
- Can you turn it down?

32:01.615 --> 32:05.010
- ♪ Did Venus
blow your mind? ♪

32:05.053 --> 32:08.709
- A really, really

32:10.406 --> 32:12.582
- Can you please?

32:15.542 --> 32:16.891
Give me some of that.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.911
- So...

32:36.955 --> 32:39.653
you hear from Beth?

32:39.696 --> 32:41.394
- She couldn't find the body.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.573
Did you come all the way here
to ask me that?

32:50.272 --> 32:51.404
- I'm sorry.

32:56.626 --> 32:59.673
Lo siento.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.589
- French.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.547
- Je suis désolée.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.464
- German?

33:08.508 --> 33:12.077
- Eine un Wiener schnitzel.

33:13.643 --> 33:15.384
- That's not real.

33:15.428 --> 33:16.646
- But I mean every word.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.529
I got Stan a lawyer.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.618
- How?
- I'm a disaster.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.402
- What did you do?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.144
- I used
the counterfeit money.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.625
- Oh, Jesus.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.714
-  I'm like
that oil spill in the Gulf

33:40.757 --> 33:43.064
where they're still
cleaning up the pelicans.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.329
I'm the mess, not you.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.071
- Oh, believe me,
I've destroyed

33:50.115 --> 33:53.031
my fair share
of ecosystems.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.686
- But I shouldn't
have said it.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.471
You're a good person.

33:58.514 --> 33:59.472
You always have our backs--

33:59.515 --> 34:01.082
- Noah's FBI.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.132
I told him stuff.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.264
- What stuff?

34:10.700 --> 34:13.051
- Like, a lot.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.840
Do I win?

34:19.883 --> 34:21.885
- It's real close.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.413
- Hey, when does Noah's
shift start?

34:27.456 --> 34:29.067
- In, like, 20 minutes.
Why?

34:29.110 --> 34:31.156
- 'Cause that's what time
I'm gonna get the puke flu

34:31.199 --> 34:32.592
and go home.

34:32.635 --> 34:34.681
- Yo, Tyler, I just left it
out on the loading dock.

34:34.724 --> 34:35.899
- Cool, I'll hang it up
for you.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.640
What'd you bag this time?
- Six-point buck.

34:37.684 --> 34:40.643
- Oh, hell yeah.
-  Yeah.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.081
That guy.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.300
- So people pay you

34:45.344 --> 34:46.997
to store the meat?

34:47.041 --> 34:48.651
- Oh, no, I'm just
holding on to it for Boomer.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.653
He set the whole thing up
before he went AWOL.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.351
That sketchy little weasel

34:52.394 --> 34:54.048
would take kickback
from anyone.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.137
- Literally anyone.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.052
Cleanup on aisle two.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.706
- Wait...

34:59.749 --> 35:03.144
what do you mean,
literally anyone?

35:03.188 --> 35:05.538
- That, I'm not
at liberty to say.

35:08.367 --> 35:11.109
- It's not just hunters, is it?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.678
And...

35:15.722 --> 35:19.552
it's not just deer meat, is it?

35:20.901 --> 35:23.077
- I'm not really allowed
to ask what it is.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.170
- ♪ Buildings

35:29.214 --> 35:32.042

35:58.330 --> 36:01.376
At least he's ours now.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.683
- This cannot be
his final resting place.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.728
- Why not?

36:05.772 --> 36:07.948
- 'Cause he's not a hamster.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.558
- Do you want
to throw him away again?

36:09.602 --> 36:10.777
- Do not start.

36:10.820 --> 36:11.995
- Okay, we will take a minute

36:12.039 --> 36:13.475
and we're just gonna decide
the best way

36:13.519 --> 36:15.608
to dispose of him properly.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.131
- And respectfully.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.873
- I wish there was a toilet
big enough to flush this turd.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.181
All due respect.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.277
- So all this is going on

36:32.320 --> 36:34.235
right under
your boyfriend's nose?

36:34.279 --> 36:35.628
- How many bodies
are in there?

36:35.671 --> 36:37.586
I only saw ours...

36:37.630 --> 36:40.459
and a pit bull somebody's
probably getting stuffed.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.548
- Ew.
- Gross.

36:42.591 --> 36:46.247
- And he's not
my boyfriend anymore, FYI.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.517
- Maybe he should be.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.041
- No.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.913
- You could hand-feed him.
- No.

36:59.956 --> 37:01.915
- It would get him
off our trail.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.221
- With my vagina?

37:03.264 --> 37:05.614
- If we could use
somebody else's, we would.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.925
- I really liked him.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.666
- I know.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.321
- Sadie, like, loves him.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.236
- I know.

37:30.639 --> 37:31.945
- Are you ready for this?

37:31.988 --> 37:33.729
- Uh, hit me.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.775
- You not ready for this.
Mama, you ready for this?

37:36.602 --> 37:37.951
- Play the damn song already.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.693
- Okay, watch this.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.827
Okay, now you do it.

37:47.352 --> 37:51.051
Oh...

37:51.094 --> 37:53.271
Mm.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.797
- Okay.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.624
- What?

37:58.667 --> 38:00.278
Can't love up on my wife?

38:01.496 --> 38:03.237
- Get the spoons, Casanova.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.065
- Mm, spoons.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.372
Got it.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.943
- I like this mood on you.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.597
- I like having
my daughter back.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.817
- Me too.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.384
- I also like having
a good lawyer.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.907
- Me too.

38:20.950 --> 38:24.345
- What I don't like
is how we're paying for it.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.999
- If I didn't do something bad,

38:26.042 --> 38:28.828
something worse
would have happened.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.525
- Who--who said that, now?

38:30.569 --> 38:31.700
- Daddy!

38:31.744 --> 38:34.921
- Keep it going, baby.
I'm coming.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.406
- So what am I
looking at here?

38:41.449 --> 38:43.364
- It's not a VIN.
It's not a bank account.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.018
It's not a street address.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.019
- Okay.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.456
- That...

38:48.500 --> 38:49.892
is a serial number.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.503
- She keeps records
of her cash?

38:51.546 --> 38:53.853
- Oh, yeah.
'Cause it's not real.

38:53.896 --> 38:57.204
Forensics tracked these

38:57.247 --> 39:00.512
back to three different sources
in the area, okay?

39:00.555 --> 39:01.904
The paper's all totally legit,

39:01.948 --> 39:04.646
but the bills are all
in sequence, man.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.474
- That's as good as it gets.

39:06.518 --> 39:07.649
- Yes.

39:07.693 --> 39:08.781
They're counterfeiters.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.652
The pills are just the tip.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.351
Who knows how big
this thing goes?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.701
So...

39:15.744 --> 39:18.225
I mean, don't hold back.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.096
I'm awesome.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.230
- Here's the thing:
she's a mother of four.

39:23.273 --> 39:26.929
She volunteers, crafts,
bakes for the neighborhood.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.453
- Okay.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.151
- We jump on this now,
she'll get Martha Stewart time.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.240
If we dig deeper--

39:33.283 --> 39:35.111
just a little deeper--

39:35.155 --> 39:36.939
connect the dots...

39:36.983 --> 39:39.420
- You get motive
for the murder too.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.248
- I want everything.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.033
- Question...

39:46.122 --> 39:47.994
Does your boyfriend know how
much you think about this shit?

39:48.037 --> 39:49.169
- Shut up, man.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.170
We're gonna go out,

39:50.213 --> 39:51.476
get a pint, okay?

39:51.519 --> 39:53.347
Something real bad like, uh--
like cookie dough.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.741
Does this sound familiar?

39:55.784 --> 39:58.178
- You want to know what it is?
- Yes, please.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.400
- She's a terrible human being.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.619
And she thinks
because she lives

40:04.663 --> 40:06.665
in this clean little bubble

40:06.708 --> 40:09.015
that no one's gonna notice.

40:15.238 --> 40:18.067
- So...

40:18.111 --> 40:18.894
mint chip?

40:18.938 --> 40:20.374
- Get out.
- Mm-hmm.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.507
- And I'm tired of getting
all the carrots back.

40:22.550 --> 40:23.638
I'm spending money.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.205
You guys have to eat
a vegetable.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.599
- Yeah, just dip them
in ketchup.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.252
Pretend they're French fries.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.253
- Here you go.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.516
- Hyah!

40:40.525 --> 40:42.440
- I'll pick them up later.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.315
- Hey, uh...

40:48.358 --> 40:49.534
thank you.

40:49.577 --> 40:51.187
- I mean, it is my turn.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.711
- No.

40:52.754 --> 40:56.323
For, you know,
finally being honest.

41:02.416 --> 41:05.158
- I signed the papers.
They're on your desk.

41:05.201 --> 41:07.116
- Look, I'm not gonna try
to take anything.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.902
Like, I don't want
the house or--

41:09.945 --> 41:12.121
- What about the kids?

41:14.820 --> 41:17.387
- Mommy, come here!

41:17.431 --> 41:18.737
- One second.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.566
- The Coopers' dog
is eating your new flowers!

41:25.787 --> 41:26.875
- Oh, my God!

41:26.919 --> 41:29.312
Macy, Macy, Macy!
Get out of here!

41:30.357 --> 41:31.706
Get out of there!

41:31.750 --> 41:33.621
Come on, come on, come on!
Go home!
