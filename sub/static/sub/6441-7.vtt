00:03.070 --> 00:07.666
- Clark, you're gonna be late.
- Okay, Mom, I'm going as fast as I can.

00:07.842 --> 00:11.539
How can you be fast as lightning and
as slow as molasses all at the same time?

00:11.712 --> 00:13.771
Sometimes, Mom, I'm even
a mystery to myself.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.473
Wait a minute, didn't I fix
your alarm clock recently?

00:16.650 --> 00:19.278
I crushed it this morning
hitting the snooze alarm.

00:19.453 --> 00:23.856
- Guess I'm not much of a morning person.
- Must have gotten that from your mother.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.856
She could be late to her own wedding.

00:26.027 --> 00:30.361
- In fact, she was late to her own wedding.
- Not all of us were trained by roosters.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.261
I was up late studying
for an exam, Greek tragedy.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.267
Speaking of Greek tragedy,
I've gotta get your mother to work.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.928
- Want a ride?
- No, I'd just slow you guys down.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.040
Thank you, baby.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.626
Hera freaks out because Zeus
has been two-timing her...

02:16.804 --> 02:20.604
...with a mere mortal, no less, so she
sends a bunch of snakes to kill Hercules...

02:20.774 --> 02:24.266
...who is the illegitimate babe
in the cradle.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.710
It's just family dysfunction
of Dionysian proportions.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.516
It sounds like these people
ought to be on Ricki Lake.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.551
While I don't condone her behavior,
Zeus did break his vows.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.189
Doesn't give her the right
to go Fatal Attraction.

02:36.357 --> 02:40.123
Hey, Clark, hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.099
Hello, Clark.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.606
- Do we know each other?
- No.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.935
Well, yes.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.406
Clark, I'm your mother.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.562
It's obviously a mistake,
she's not your mother.

03:56.737 --> 04:01.037
That's what I told her. She said I probably
just need time to get used to the idea.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.808
She gave me her phone number,
told me to call if I wanted to talk again.

04:04.979 --> 04:07.914
I don't want you to have
anything to do with this woman.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.515
She's gonna be hard to avoid.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.514
She said she just bought a house...

04:11.685 --> 04:13.676
...in Smallville.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.422
She also said the agency that handled the
adoption was Metropolis United Charities.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.226
That's the same place
Chloe told me about.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.387
I thought the only adoption
they handled was mine.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.230
So did I.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.862
- Dad, tell me what happened back then.
- That's not important right now.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.066
Your mother's right. We need to get
this woman to back off.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.870
We don't want her making people curious
about where you came from.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.516
Mrs. Kent...

04:45.953 --> 04:47.750
...I know what you're thinking:

04:48.222 --> 04:49.849
"This woman gave her baby up.

04:56.997 --> 05:01.093
Look, Mrs. Dunlevy,
I'm sure you mean well.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.362
And I know you've gone through
a lot of trouble finding Clark...

05:04.538 --> 05:06.631
...but he's not your child.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.275
Oh, I've done the research.

05:10.444 --> 05:14.972
My Lucas was the only baby turned
over to Metropolis United Charities...

05:15.149 --> 05:17.777
...and Clark was the only child
that they ever placed.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.045
We are Clark's legal parents,
we raised him.

05:21.221 --> 05:24.054
Believe me, I'm not trying
to take Clark away from you.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.784
I just want a chance
to get to know him.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.861
Giving up Lucas was the worst thing
I've ever done.

05:31.031 --> 05:34.296
I didn't do it because I wanted to,
I did it because I had to.

05:36.337 --> 05:42.139
I sincerely hope that you
find Lucas someday.

05:43.477 --> 05:49.712
But I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
not to bother my family or Clark ever again.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.049
No.

06:05.099 --> 06:08.899
Sure, Clark, you can use my computer.
Knock yourself out.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.400
You've been getting e-mails
from Rachel Dunlevy.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.873
You've been reading my e-mails?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.566
You promised me you'd stop
digging into my adoption.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.873
All I did was post a few notices on adoption
websites to see if I could get some hits.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.416
This Dunlevy woman responded.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.987
So you said, "Why don't you check out
my buddy Clark, he may be your son."

06:29.156 --> 06:32.250
You have to believe me,
I didn't tell her anything about you.

06:32.426 --> 06:36.157
So it's just a coincidence she shows up
in Smallville claiming to be my mom?

06:36.330 --> 06:40.733
She's here? Clark, what makes you
so sure that she's not the real thing?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.801
I'm not giving you
an exclusive on my life.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.701
- You're not curious she might be your mom?
- Why are you obsessed about my mother?

06:46.874 --> 06:49.638
- Do I ask you questions about yours?
- I guess not.

06:49.810 --> 06:53.268
If you want to find somebody's mother,
find your own.

06:53.447 --> 06:58.077
I know where she is, Clark. The difference
is she's not interested in me.

07:03.257 --> 07:07.318
Since you may never speak to me again,
there's something you might want to know.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.663
Metropolis United Charities
was founded by Lionel Luthor.

07:19.239 --> 07:23.835
I admit, I'm even more intrigued now
than when I got your note.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.411
But I'm still not sure what
this has to do with me.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.640
Well, I understand that you
and Clark are good friends.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.448
Mr. Kent has forbidden me
to speak to him.

07:32.619 --> 07:37.647
I thought you might be willing to talk
to Clark, ask him to give me a chance.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.322
Ms. Dunlevy, Jonathan Kent
doesn't exactly see me...

07:41.495 --> 07:44.055
...as the ideal role model for his son.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.029
I wouldn't want to encourage Clark
to defy his father.

07:47.201 --> 07:50.466
Even if it meant giving him a chance
to know his real mother?

07:52.105 --> 07:56.201
I'm sorry, but it's just not appropriate
for me to get involved.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.475
I wasn't going to bring this up
unless I had to...

08:01.648 --> 08:05.015
...but I once worked for your mother.
- You knew my mother?

08:06.186 --> 08:11.021
And your father.
He and I became very close.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.866
He got me pregnant and made me
give the child up for adoption.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.300
You're claiming that Clark...?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.846
That Clark and I...?

08:33.380 --> 08:36.144
He's your brother, Lex.

08:41.455 --> 08:45.221
Chloe. Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.853
What's wrong?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.588
Clark and I just had
a massive blowout.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.163
About what?

08:52.332 --> 08:56.860
Secrets, privacy, my pathological inability
to curb my curiosity.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.835
- How are you?
- Hey, we can talk about it later.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.936
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to dump on you.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.144
- Lf you can't dump on your friends...
- Exactly.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.679
So, what did you want to talk about?

09:18.492 --> 09:21.893
- His name's Henry Small.
- As in the Smallville Smalls?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.291
Our very own first family.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.526
Well, who's the hottie
hanging all over him?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.204
My mom.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.570
- Oh, I'm sorry, Lana.
- It's okay, you didn't know.

09:39.146 --> 09:42.741
I think he may be
my biological father.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.274
You okay?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.213
I think so.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.920
I want to find out everything
there is to know about him.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.857
I thought...

09:56.029 --> 09:57.428
...maybe you could help.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.898
- But if you don't feel comfortable, it's...
- Actually, I'm flattered.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.734
It's nice that someone trusts me enough
with their big family secret.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.966
Then you'll do it?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.178
I can tell you where he went to college...

10:12.346 --> 10:14.678
...how many outstanding
parking tickets he has...

10:14.848 --> 10:18.477
...I can even pull up his dental records
and tell you if he flosses regularly.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.244
But if you want
to know who he is...

10:20.420 --> 10:25.357
...I would suggest using the high-tech
research device called the doorbell.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.234
- Clark?
- Grab a sack, son.

10:41.408 --> 10:45.970
I just found out that Lionel Luthor
founded Metropolis United Charities.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.013
Why was he involved in my adoption?

10:49.883 --> 10:54.149
- Would somebody tell me what's going on?
- Jonathan, he needs to know.

10:59.059 --> 11:03.189
All right. It was the day of
the meteor shower when I realized...

11:03.530 --> 11:06.158
...that nothing was gonna be normal
around here again.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.205
What's happening, Jonathan?

11:50.177 --> 11:51.701
Martha?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.171
Teddy!

13:05.485 --> 13:06.918
Jonathan, look out!

13:07.120 --> 13:11.784
Help! Stop, please! I need help!

13:13.593 --> 13:15.618
- Are you all right?
- It's my son.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.129
- What about him? Is he hurt?
- He... I can't...

13:19.299 --> 13:21.529
Mister, calm down here.
Where is your son?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.261
He... He's...

13:39.619 --> 13:40.984
Give me a hand.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.485
What happened to him?
His hair is...

14:06.680 --> 14:08.705
Can't we go any faster?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.175
We're doing the best that we can.

14:12.419 --> 14:15.479
What are you carrying back there?
It's slowing us down.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.417
Hey, how's your son?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.526
He's in shock, but he'll survive.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.634
You saved him, acting so quickly.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.201
I'm glad I could help out.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.437
I'm sorry. I don't
even know your name.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.598
Jonathan Kent.

15:09.776 --> 15:14.440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kent.
If there's ever anything I can do for you...

15:14.614 --> 15:16.809
...please, call me.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.452
I mean that, Mr. Kent.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.363
Dad, you were a hero.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.971
I don't know why you thought
you had to keep that a secret from me.

15:52.018 --> 15:55.283
Ethan. Is there something
we can do for you?

15:55.455 --> 15:59.789
I'm sure you know there's a woman
in town claiming to be Clark's mother.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.724
Well, she's petitioned Judge Ross
to order a DNA test.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.933
- But that's crazy. She's not my mother.
- Lf that's true, this test will prove it, son.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.593
I can have somebody come out and take
the sample to Metropolis Genetics Lab.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.298
They can run the test in the morning,
we can get this thing over with quick.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.706
I'm sure you folks have
nothing to be afraid of.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.959
Not to mention, it's an eyesore.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.830
No. They're dumping there.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.094
Oh, come on.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.897
What do you mean, that's it?

16:46.072 --> 16:49.041
I don't care what
Lowell County Water and Power says...

16:49.209 --> 16:53.942
...they are illegally dumping, and
I'm not gonna sit here... Hello? Hello?!

16:57.050 --> 16:58.608
- Mr. Small?
- What?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.251
I'm sorry.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.794
I'm not taking on
any more law students right now.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.728
No, no, I'm not a law student.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.632
Wait, I know you.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.296
You do?

17:21.473 --> 17:24.932
Yeah, you run the coffee place
in town.

17:25.111 --> 17:28.376
Yeah, yeah, the Talon.
I don't think I've seen you there.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.982
And you never will. I boycott it.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.952
Do you have a thing against coffee?

17:36.089 --> 17:38.683
No, I've got a thing against Luthors.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.788
Lex Luthor's just a silent partner.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.459
That's what the Vichy said about Nazis.
Look what happened to France.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.664
I didn't catch your name.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.704
Lana Lang.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.472
You knew my mother.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.348
Where did you get this?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.719
I found it.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.329
Did you love her?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.830
What do you want me to say?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.503
It's ancient history, it doesn't matter.

18:24.671 --> 18:29.404
Henry, can you stop saving the world for
one minute and give me a hand, please?

18:29.576 --> 18:32.101
Okay, honey, I'll be right there.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.918
- Look, Lana...
- I think you might be my father.

18:41.521 --> 18:47.050
- Honey, are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be in in one second.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.188
Look, Lana, you've made a mistake.

18:50.363 --> 18:55.164
- But l...
- I have a family now.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.635
Please, don't bother me again.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.845
There. Now that didn't
hurt a bit, did it?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.690
I'll let you know.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.593
Dad...

19:29.769 --> 19:33.762
You had to do it, Clark. If we'd refused,
they'd have dragged us into court.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.670
What happens when they look
at his DNA under a microscope?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.105
If I even have DNA.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.907
That's why we have to make sure nobody
gets a chance to analyze that sample.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.142
This is it.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.719
There.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.530
Man, this Mission: Impossible
stuff is great...

20:43.876 --> 20:46.902
...but other than my scintillating
conversational skills...

20:47.080 --> 20:49.981
...I still don't understand
why you brought me along.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.881
I need your spit.

21:00.693 --> 21:04.789
You can relax. We switched
the sample, no one saw us.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.831
Clark, I'm sorry to have put
you through all this.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.368
It's not your fault, Dad. I guess
it just comes with the territory.

21:11.537 --> 21:15.439
Yeah. I'm gonna go
work on the combine.

21:18.578 --> 21:22.275
Everything's okay. Why does
Dad still seem upset?

21:23.182 --> 21:25.616
This has been tough on him.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.979
He always said making
a deal with the devil...

21:28.154 --> 21:31.612
...was gonna come back to haunt us.
- Then why'd he do it?

21:33.559 --> 21:35.186
Come on, Mom.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.253
Why'd you need Lionel Luthor's
help in the first place?

21:41.567 --> 21:44.559
You have no idea
the kind of pressure we were under.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.835
We suddenly had this new
little person in our home.

21:48.007 --> 21:52.535
We didn't know what to do with you.
We were completely overwhelmed.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.244
Thank goodness
your mother was a pack rat.

22:00.420 --> 22:04.049
Sweetheart, he's not ours to keep.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.750
I just keep feeling there's
a reason he's here.

22:08.928 --> 22:12.091
He's exactly what I wished for
in the flower shop this morning.

22:12.265 --> 22:17.567
Hey. Since when did Martha Kent
believe in magic wands?

22:18.604 --> 22:21.664
Since the moment
I laid eyes on this little boy.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.511
Get him upstairs. Hurry, go on.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.112
Just a...

22:28.281 --> 22:29.805
Just a second.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.950
- Evening, Jonathan.
- Ethan.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.750
I saw what was left
of your truck out on Route 17.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.291
I wanted to stop by
and make sure you're all right.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.895
We're just a little banged up,
but we're fine.

22:44.063 --> 22:49.933
Look, I'm sure there are folks who need
your attention a lot more than we...

22:50.937 --> 22:54.304
- Who's the little fellow?
- He got away from me. He's strong.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.837
- That's...
- Clark.

22:58.311 --> 23:01.371
I thought my family name
would make a good first name.

23:01.547 --> 23:06.280
Deputy, I would like you to be the
first one in Smallville to meet our son.

23:09.555 --> 23:13.047
Adopted, of course. We just brought him
back from Metropolis this morning.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.757
I didn't know you folks
were planning to adopt.

23:16.863 --> 23:20.128
Oh, Ethan, you know us,
we like to keep to ourselves.

23:20.299 --> 23:24.065
But it's been in the works
for quite a while.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.034
Well, congratulations.

23:28.207 --> 23:32.041
It's nice to see something good
happen in the middle of all this tragedy.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.180
He was right.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.587
You were the one good thing
that happened that day.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.454
So you just made it up,
spur of the moment.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.466
I couldn't say we'd found you
in a corn field.

23:56.636 --> 24:00.834
Once the words came out, I knew
we'd have to back them up eventually.

24:01.040 --> 24:06.342
So we called Lionel Luthor, cashed in
that favor. He arranged everything.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.507
If everything worked out,
why'd you keep it secret?

24:09.682 --> 24:14.085
Hey, I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.050
Not at all, Lex.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.888
Ever wish you had a big brother
to help you with your jump shot?

24:22.061 --> 24:26.327
I think I've managed to become
a pretty decent player on my own.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.266
Rachel Dunlevy came to see me.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.773
She says you and I have
a few chromosomes in common.

24:34.941 --> 24:38.468
My father's chromosomes, to be exact.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.912
You mean...?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.640
Personally, I think I got
all the looks in the family.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.346
I don't know what happened
between her and your father...

24:49.522 --> 24:52.650
...but she's not my mother.
- Trust me, I'm as skeptical as you are.

24:52.825 --> 24:57.228
For all I know, this is an elaborate scheme
to win a paternity suit against my father.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.193
Did you ask him about it?

24:59.365 --> 25:03.859
I didn't want to make any accusations until
I had more facts. It's not hard to imagine.

25:04.036 --> 25:09.133
In the annals of extramarital exploits,
my father probably has his own chapter.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.577
It doesn't bother you? I mean,
I know how close you were to your mother.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.610
To the extent that it caused
my mother pain...

25:20.786 --> 25:22.811
...sure, it bothers me.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.718
Unfortunately, not every marriage...

25:24.891 --> 25:28.327
...is quite as Rockwellian
as Jonathan and Martha Kent's.

25:31.697 --> 25:35.326
Anyway, I told Ms. Dunlevy
that in the 21 st century...

25:35.501 --> 25:38.902
...people shouldn't make claims like hers
without the DNA to back them up.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.243
So, what do you think, Clark?

25:47.213 --> 25:49.340
No chance we could be brothers?

25:51.183 --> 25:53.947
As cool as that would be,
Lex, we're not.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.857
Rachel.

26:06.532 --> 26:10.662
When the guard called and told me
you were down at the gate...

26:10.836 --> 26:13.202
...I didn't believe him.
We had an agreement.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.431
I just got the results
from the DNA test.

26:15.608 --> 26:18.076
I don't know how, but you
did something to alter them.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.042
Did what? What are you
talking about?

26:21.213 --> 26:23.477
Clark Kent is our son,
and you know that!

26:24.850 --> 26:29.947
You haven't changed, Rachel.
You are still completely irrational.

26:30.122 --> 26:34.957
No, the only irrational thing that I ever did
was to let you rip my child from my arms.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.925
You were well-compensated
and well taken care of.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.930
You think money made up for
seven years in a psychiatric ward?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.362
You needed help.

26:42.535 --> 26:45.368
No, what I needed was
a home and a family.

26:45.538 --> 26:48.234
After you were through with me
that wasn't going to happen.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.999
Not with Lucas, not with anybody.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.076
Why didn't you
continue your treatment?

26:52.244 --> 26:55.839
I didn't need any treatment.
You just wanted me out of the way.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.573
Classic denial.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.844
Oh, this isn't over, Lionel.
I'm gonna expose you.

27:01.020 --> 27:06.390
Expose me? To whom?
My wife is dead. You know that.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.226
Are you still as beautiful, Rachel?

27:14.433 --> 27:16.401
Oh, you were lovely.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.168
You have to move on.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.943
Forget the past.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.946
If you need help, I'd be happy
to call Dr. Friedberg.

27:30.116 --> 27:35.144
I'm sure he'd be more than willing
to make room for you at the clinic.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.309
Ms. Dunlevy?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.748
Is everything all right?

28:11.257 --> 28:12.815
There.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.487
Wow, that is quite a catch.

28:18.664 --> 28:23.067
Took all my strength to pull that one in.
My dad even had to help me land it.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.464
You're lucky you've got
such a great father.

28:27.807 --> 28:31.004
I heard you and Chloe had a big fight.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.781
Don't worry, she didn't
give me any details.

28:37.016 --> 28:41.715
I assume that this is shrouded
in the usual Kent cloak of secrecy.

28:43.989 --> 28:47.186
Chloe promised not to look
into my adoption, and then she did.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.328
Now I've got a woman in town
claiming to be my mother.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.156
- Is there any chance?
- No, not in a million years.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.229
She just showed up
out of the blue?

28:57.403 --> 29:02.500
She ambushed me at school. "Hi, Clark,
I'm your mother." I mean, who does that?

29:10.249 --> 29:13.480
Do you remember that guy
in the photo with my mom?

29:14.019 --> 29:19.719
I found out who he was. His name's
Henry Small. I went to his house.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.021
- How'd it go?
- Well...

29:25.197 --> 29:28.462
...he hates the Talon, hates the Luthors,
compared me to the Nazis...

29:28.634 --> 29:30.864
...and told me to never
come back again.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.765
That good, huh?

29:37.643 --> 29:41.272
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.915
I have done pretty well
without a father this long...

29:44.083 --> 29:46.916
...I don't know why I thought
I needed one now.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.379
I do.

29:55.094 --> 29:59.224
Lana, we're different. We don't get to see
our biological parents every day...

29:59.398 --> 30:02.993
...and see a little piece of who we are
or who we may become.

30:03.636 --> 30:07.231
If I had a chance to get to know
my birth parents...

30:08.240 --> 30:12.199
...I wouldn't give up just because the first
meeting didn't go the way I hoped.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.725
There.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.827
- No, no, no. You're okay.
- Where am I?

30:37.002 --> 30:39.163
You're at my house.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.066
I bought it with the money
your father gave me.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.573
I knew I'd need it one day,
so I never spent it.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.735
I'm fixing it up so that Clark
will feel at home here.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.847
I know how hard it must be.

30:50.015 --> 30:53.246
No, no. No, you don't.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.320
All those lost years.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.185
Martha Kent getting to
bake the birthday cakes.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.328
Martha Kent getting to dry his tears.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.963
So that gives you the right
to kidnap me?

31:06.131 --> 31:10.431
Believe me, I didn't want to do this,
but your father gave me no choice.

31:10.603 --> 31:14.266
Look, if my father's lying,
Clark really is my brother.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.102
I want to know just as much
as you do.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.536
How does holding me prisoner help you?

31:19.712 --> 31:23.910
Because, Lex, either your father
tells the truth...

31:24.083 --> 31:28.019
...or he's going to know
the pain of losing his son.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.257
What's wrong?

31:42.434 --> 31:45.892
Rachel Dunlevy.
She's kidnapped Lex.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.333
Oh, my God.

31:47.506 --> 31:52.239
If I don't call a press conference announcing
that Clark's adoption was a sham...

31:52.411 --> 31:56.472
...and that he's my illegitimate son,
she's...

31:56.649 --> 31:58.810
She's gonna kill Lex.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.692
Chloe, I'm so glad I found you.

32:08.193 --> 32:10.753
Okay, there's a sentence
I never thought I'd hear again.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.863
We both did and said things
that we regret.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.868
I know I did.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.938
Look, you have to believe that
I would burn my press pass...

32:21.140 --> 32:23.040
...if I thought it would
come between us.

32:23.309 --> 32:27.109
No, you wouldn't. It's too much of who
you are, and right now I need it.

32:30.916 --> 32:34.818
If Rachel Dunlevy did buy a house,
she'll be listed with the county clerk.

32:34.987 --> 32:38.582
It's just gonna take a minute
to get a hit.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.460
Chloe, what I said about your mother,
I was way out of line.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.899
It's cool. We all have
family secrets, I guess.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.203
She left when I was 5.

32:52.371 --> 32:57.138
I came downstairs, and there
was my dad trying to make waffles.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.943
He never even really explained
why she left. It was weird.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.181
I'm sorry.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.958
It's hard thinking you weren't
good enough for someone to love.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.254
Don't ever think that.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.940
There is no record of Rachel Dunlevy.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.572
Try the name Lucas Luthor.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.816
Okay, you're gonna have to explain
that one to me later.

33:47.993 --> 33:51.520
Bingo. There's his address.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.462
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for coming on such short notice.

34:00.639 --> 34:06.043
I have an important announcement
to make that concerns my family.

34:07.646 --> 34:12.014
My son, Lex Luthor, has been kidnapped.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.947
I want to say to his abductor:

34:15.120 --> 34:18.283
I will never give in to your demands.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.049
- No.
- Lf you harm him...

34:20.225 --> 34:21.522
- No! No!
...in any way...

34:22.561 --> 34:24.585
...I will not rest...

34:25.130 --> 34:29.567
...until you are hunted down
and locked away, this time forever.

34:30.335 --> 34:34.168
It's always been the policy of my company
and my family never to negotiate...

34:34.373 --> 34:38.536
- Where are you going? No!
- Your father just killed you, Lex.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.209
Who are you?

35:17.349 --> 35:20.045
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
I'm not your son.

35:20.219 --> 35:21.379
No.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.218
Oh, no.

35:37.603 --> 35:41.004
- Lf you need anything else, give me a shout.
- Thanks.

35:41.173 --> 35:44.438
Cute place, very colorful.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.574
Mr. Small.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.009
Call me Henry.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.675
Can I get you a coffee?

35:54.119 --> 35:58.749
- Of course, you wouldn't want a coffee.
- Regular coffee would be great.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.385
I got your letter.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.854
And yes, you did ambush me.

36:07.132 --> 36:11.762
But from the way you describe yourself,
it might just be a habit you got from me.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.398
So you are my father?

36:18.477 --> 36:20.377
I don't know.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.913
But I'm willing to find out.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.594
Rachel's been admitted to
a private psychiatric clinic.

36:36.762 --> 36:40.823
Even if she tries to explain what you did,
nobody will believe her.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.271
- I really feel sorry for her.
- We all do, son.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.464
I can't even imagine what it was like
giving up that baby.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.141
I'm just glad our own family
is still in one piece.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.576
Not even Lionel Luthor
could tear us apart.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.253
But Lionel helped us.

37:07.426 --> 37:10.088
Dad, why do you hate him so much?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.970
The morning he came by
with the adoption papers...

37:24.476 --> 37:27.377
...I thought I'd never lay eyes
on him again.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.307
Mr. Kent.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.883
Mr. Luthor.

37:35.053 --> 37:38.580
You call me Lionel, please.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.155
Lionel.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.491
I think you'll find everything in order.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.095
Thank you.

37:51.270 --> 37:55.070
And thank you for bringing it out yourself.
You really didn't have to do that.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.765
We're taking Lex back
to Metropolis today.

37:58.010 --> 38:01.002
Hey, that's fantastic. I'm glad
your son's gonna be all right.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.204
Thank you. Thank you.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.980
There is one thing I'd like you
to do for me.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.620
- Yeah?
- I'm sure you've heard...

38:09.788 --> 38:13.417
...the Ross brothers are having second
thoughts about selling me their factory.

38:13.592 --> 38:17.722
They don't want to sell to an outsider.
They're friends of yours, aren't they?

38:19.064 --> 38:22.192
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.
- Talk to them.

38:22.367 --> 38:26.599
Convince them that I only
have Smallville's best interests at heart.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.366
I think it would make a difference.

38:29.574 --> 38:33.738
I really don't think that's
really any of my business, Mr. Luthor.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.677
I understand.

38:41.019 --> 38:44.750
I'd be careful with that. I wouldn't
want the Department of Family Welfare...

38:44.923 --> 38:48.051
...to find out young Clark's
adoption's a sham.

38:49.394 --> 38:52.761
Wait, are you threatening me?

38:53.565 --> 38:58.127
Of course not.
I'm just asking for a small favor.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.811
So you did it.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.985
You convinced the Rosses to sell.

39:20.325 --> 39:22.987
I helped the Luthors get
a foothold on this community.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.757
The smokestacks, the toxic dumping...

39:26.932 --> 39:31.665
...all the people who were cheated,
including Pete's family...

39:32.871 --> 39:36.034
- It wouldn't have happened, if not for me.
- You couldn't have known.

39:36.241 --> 39:40.473
I should have known. I knew exactly
what kind of a man Lionel Luthor was.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.976
Why didn't you tell me?

39:42.147 --> 39:46.584
I knew you would do exactly what
you're doing now, which is blame yourself.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.112
- You were protecting me, it is my fault.
- No.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.351
You never believe that.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.288
This was my decision.
This is my fault.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.089
Mine alone.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.630
Lex, is that you?

40:35.333 --> 40:38.393
Still alive and kicking, Dad.
No thanks to you.

40:38.570 --> 40:42.267
You're a survivor, son.
I knew she wasn't gonna kill you.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.971
Not for lack of trying.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.909
I couldn't give in to her.
You must know that.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.139
Like you did all those years ago?

40:54.152 --> 40:59.522
I loved your mother
very deeply, Lex...

40:59.691 --> 41:02.660
...but I was not a perfect husband.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.887
I strayed.

41:06.398 --> 41:09.265
If you've never been tempted,
I'm sure one day you will be.

41:09.434 --> 41:14.531
We're not talking about me, Dad.
We're talking about Rachel Dunlevy.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.402
Did she bear your illegitimate son
or not?

41:18.844 --> 41:21.404
I never knew she was pregnant.

41:21.580 --> 41:25.641
Then she reappeared one day
with a child she claimed was mine...

41:25.817 --> 41:29.309
...demanding that I leave
your mother and marry her.

41:31.723 --> 41:34.248
So you bribed her to give
the child up for adoption.

41:34.426 --> 41:37.395
She was imbalanced.
She threatened me.

41:37.562 --> 41:40.030
Your mother was too sick
to burden her with a scandal.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.134
Your altruism is inspiring, Dad.

41:43.335 --> 41:46.463
I did what I thought
best for everyone.

41:46.638 --> 41:48.936
I had the child placed
with a suitable family.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.703
- Not the Kents?
- The Kents?

41:53.512 --> 41:55.446
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Then where is he?

42:01.520 --> 42:03.010
He...

42:05.590 --> 42:07.421
...died...

42:07.592 --> 42:09.150
...before his first birthday.

42:18.069 --> 42:20.663
Forgive me, Lex, I'm very tired.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.740
It's been a long day.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.837
Sure, Dad.
