00:00.435 --> 00:03.919
- Are you interested in Jack?
- No.

00:07.135 --> 00:09.340
It was a huge, stupid mistake,

00:09.635 --> 00:11.320
and it will never happen
again, I promise.

00:16.135 --> 00:18.775
And, yeah, Lily's probably
right, I'm maybe...

00:20.375 --> 00:22.235
a bit in love with you.

00:24.175 --> 00:26.077
Eric threatened to quit
the show last night.

00:26.102 --> 00:26.895
What?

00:27.095 --> 00:29.935
If I don't have your trust to
produce the best show possible,

00:30.135 --> 00:33.055
unfortunately, I have no choice
but to stand down myself.

00:33.195 --> 00:35.375
No, no, no. Jack has just resigned.

00:35.575 --> 00:38.675
Look, I'll do this weekend's shows,
of course, but after that...

00:38.855 --> 00:42.095
After that can... can we just
see where we are and talk?

00:42.295 --> 00:44.407
- Are you in love with Lily?
- No!

00:44.535 --> 00:47.079
If either of us had strong feelings
for another man or a woman,

00:47.173 --> 00:50.455
I'd just want us to be... just to be
honest, you know, wouldn't you?

00:50.655 --> 00:52.775
They said she's only
three centimetres dilated.

00:52.935 --> 00:55.775
- So there's plenty of time.
- Okay.

00:55.975 --> 00:58.815
You're gonna be a dad, Pete,
you really are.

00:58.955 --> 01:00.815
I know.

01:22.595 --> 01:26.535
- How did it go?
- It was so hectic.

01:36.995 --> 01:40.775
Oh, my back really hurts.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.935
Is it worse?

01:46.095 --> 01:48.015
- I like you.
- I like you too.

01:48.215 --> 01:51.695
- I'm going to be sick.
- Oh, Pete, get a bucket, bucket.

01:51.895 --> 01:53.235
- Right.
- Quick!

01:56.815 --> 01:59.095
- Here you go.
- Mmm.

02:00.535 --> 02:02.855
- All right, that's okay.
- That's good. That's good. Yeah.

02:04.575 --> 02:06.155
- I have to have a bath.
- Bath...

02:06.355 --> 02:08.155
- I'll run it. Yep.
- Bath.

02:11.795 --> 02:12.975
Bath's ready.

02:13.115 --> 02:15.455
No, I don't wanna have a bath.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.695
Okay.

02:17.895 --> 02:20.335
I need a shower.

02:22.215 --> 02:26.155
- Come in, I need to lean on you.
- Oh.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.515
- Oh...
- You right?

02:28.715 --> 02:31.255
Is that right? Sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.095
Is that all right?

02:36.855 --> 02:39.095
- You still want it on your back?
- My back!

02:39.120 --> 02:40.875
Yeah, I got it.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.485
I'll be right back.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.155
Huh!

02:51.275 --> 02:52.895
Oh, how you going?

02:53.095 --> 02:54.975
- Any calls?
- No calls.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.575
- Thanks.
- Yep.

02:56.715 --> 02:58.255
Hi, Dale, it's me.

02:58.455 --> 03:01.055
- Um, has Jack turned up yet?
- He's not in the studio.

03:01.255 --> 03:03.615
And doesn't look like he's up here.
He's cutting it fine.

03:03.815 --> 03:06.455
- Are you sure you got him back?
- I was sure until now.

03:06.655 --> 03:08.895
- I'll, um... I'll ring him again.
- Are you coming in?

03:09.095 --> 03:12.295
- I am, but I'm not sure what time.
- All right, keep me in the loop.

03:12.495 --> 03:14.295
Hi, you've reached Jack.

03:14.435 --> 03:15.935
I can't get to the phone right now,

03:16.135 --> 03:19.055
but if you leave me your name
and number, I'll get back to you.

03:19.255 --> 03:22.155
Jack, hi. Dale said
you haven't turned up yet.

03:22.355 --> 03:25.935
Can you give me a call and let me
know how you're travelling? Thanks.

03:26.135 --> 03:28.535
- How's everything going in there?
- It's intense.

03:28.735 --> 03:30.055
- Yeah, cool.
- Yeah.

03:30.255 --> 03:33.015
- So annoying.
- Hi, it's me.

03:33.215 --> 03:36.015
- I'm sorry to call you so early...
- What time is it, Lily?

03:36.215 --> 03:39.935
I'm at the hospital, Meredith's
in labour and I'm completely wet.

03:40.135 --> 03:41.955
Would you mind bringing me
some clean clothes?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.415
- I really have to go to work.
- Yeah, okay.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.695
I'll probably... I'll be about an hour.

03:46.895 --> 03:48.895
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you. 'Bye.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.055
God...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.575
Bernard, why are you still here?

03:57.715 --> 04:00.455
Oh, I-I'm Pete's support person.

04:00.655 --> 04:03.235
Did Pete ask you to be
his support person?

04:03.415 --> 04:05.775
He didn't have to. I mean, he sort of...

04:05.975 --> 04:08.895
- Let me know if there are any calls.
- Definitely. Definitely.

04:16.274 --> 04:18.575
Hey, do you want some gas? Yeah?

04:18.714 --> 04:20.615
Yeah, there you go.

04:26.735 --> 04:29.615
Do you want some music? You
wanna put that playlist you sorted?

04:29.815 --> 04:31.095
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:34.895 --> 04:38.095
No, no, no, no, no.

04:38.295 --> 04:40.235
- No, I hate this song.
- What?

04:40.415 --> 04:43.015
- Oh, Pete, turn it off.
- I've always hated this song.

04:43.215 --> 04:45.375
- Why did you put that song on?
- Sorry. Sorry.

04:45.575 --> 04:48.095
- I hate it, I hate it.
- Okay.

04:49.935 --> 04:53.655
Sorry to interrupt.
Dale texted and Jack's arrived.

04:53.855 --> 04:56.895
- Oh, great.
- And also a Simone called.

04:57.095 --> 04:59.055
- What?
- Simone... Simone's called.

04:59.255 --> 05:02.935
- I-I'll come out. Go, go, get out.
- Yeah, cool. All right.

05:10.695 --> 05:12.335
- Was that Mitchell?
- Ah, no.

05:12.535 --> 05:14.215
That was just someone
giving us a message.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.295
- Oh, it hurts.
- Okay?

05:16.495 --> 05:18.295
- I'll be back.
- I know it does, sweetie.

05:18.495 --> 05:21.055
- It hurts.
- I know it does.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.655
Oh, yeah, so...

05:22.855 --> 05:24.575
Hey, is Simone that
girl from your birthday

05:24.775 --> 05:26.850
who got wasted and tipped your
brother's wheelchair over?

05:26.855 --> 05:28.215
- Yes.
- I really like her.

05:28.355 --> 05:29.895
I thought she was cool.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.055
Hi.

05:52.095 --> 05:55.155
- Hi.
- Lucas told me you'd called him.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.575
I wanna be clear, this
is between you and I,

05:58.715 --> 06:00.975
please don't involve my friends.

06:04.855 --> 06:09.295
I went... I went around to Vincent's,
but... you'd already gone.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.655
What do you have to say to me?

06:11.795 --> 06:13.515
I wanna tell you...

06:14.635 --> 06:18.615
that I love you and I miss you,

06:18.755 --> 06:21.095
and I want you to come home.

06:22.875 --> 06:26.415
I wanna be your friend too, Lil,

06:26.615 --> 06:29.175
but I don't think that I can trust you.

06:30.735 --> 06:34.255
I'm not mad anymore.
I'm... I'm just nothing.

06:37.055 --> 06:41.795
And I think in the interest
of self-preservation, it's...

06:43.175 --> 06:45.575
..it's best if we're not friends.

06:48.875 --> 06:53.535
I hope you're well,
but please don't call again.

07:13.155 --> 07:14.515
Yay! You're here!

07:14.695 --> 07:16.215
You've got a couple of segments today,

07:16.295 --> 07:18.335
so I thought we'd get you
into wardrobe ASAP.

07:18.535 --> 07:22.155
- Is Lily around?
- No. Running late. No judgement.

07:22.355 --> 07:24.795
Look, I just wanna do the cooking
segment today, nothing else.

07:24.895 --> 07:26.435
What about 'Jack's Storage Solutions'?

07:26.555 --> 07:27.895
No.

07:28.035 --> 07:30.095
Well, let's get you into wardrobe.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.095
- Alice.
- Hmm?

07:35.235 --> 07:37.055
I thought he'd resigned.

07:37.255 --> 07:39.695
- Craig asked Lily to get him back.
- Why?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.575
I think because he's good-looking,

07:41.775 --> 07:44.015
a great chef and the
viewers really like him.

07:55.215 --> 07:58.535
- Oh, hey. Hi, I'm Bernard.
- Ah. Ivan.

07:58.735 --> 08:00.335
How you going? I'm one
of the godparents.

08:00.535 --> 08:02.795
- Are ya?
- Oh, hey, Dad.

08:02.995 --> 08:07.215
- Oh, how's it going?
- Ah... I think it's all right.

08:07.415 --> 08:10.335
She's in a lot of pain, though.
It's really hard to watch.

08:10.475 --> 08:12.095
Stay out here then.

08:12.295 --> 08:14.455
I'm joking. Come on.
Do you want something to drink?

08:14.655 --> 08:16.015
- Ah...
- Eat!

08:16.155 --> 08:17.695
I've got some muesli bars.

08:17.895 --> 08:19.895
- That'd be good, actually.
- No worries.

08:20.035 --> 08:22.255
Sorry, uh...

08:25.995 --> 08:27.735
Keep it coming.

08:27.935 --> 08:29.655
Keep it coming.

08:31.435 --> 08:32.794
Coming.

08:35.455 --> 08:37.255
Well done.

08:37.455 --> 08:39.794
- And breathe.
- Really good.

08:39.995 --> 08:42.174
- Good.
- Did I have a boy or a girl?

08:42.375 --> 08:44.895
No, you haven't... you
haven't had the baby yet.

08:45.095 --> 08:48.255
- Do you want some muesli bar?
- Yes.

08:48.455 --> 08:51.175
- Can we swap, please?
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

08:51.375 --> 08:54.935
Okay, okay, I got you. I got you.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.455
- Before she has another one.
- Yeah.

08:57.595 --> 08:59.515
There you go, sweetheart.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.375
- Is Ivan here? He can come in.
- No, he's outside.

09:04.575 --> 09:07.295
- He can come in. He can come in.
- I'll go get him.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.815
Ivan, Meredith wants to
know if you wanna go in.

09:12.015 --> 09:13.795
- Good, God, no.
- No.

09:13.995 --> 09:15.615
- Stay.
- Yep.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.155
Dale, you're gonna
have to call the show.

09:28.275 --> 09:29.615
Yes.

09:35.855 --> 09:38.375
Congratulations, here's your baby.

09:38.575 --> 09:40.795
Hello, it's Mummy.

09:40.915 --> 09:43.455
Oh, sweetheart!

09:43.595 --> 09:45.095
Oh, what is it?

09:45.295 --> 09:47.095
It's a little girl. It's a little girl.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.735
- She's beautiful.
- She's perfect.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.155
Oh, look at your little fingers.

09:52.355 --> 09:55.935
They're your little fingers.
Hello, beautiful girl.

09:56.135 --> 09:58.655
- Hello.
- Oh, she's perfect.

09:58.855 --> 10:01.815
- Hey, beautiful girl.
- Ah, look at our little girl.

10:02.015 --> 10:03.655
- Yes. Hello. Oh.
- Hey?

10:03.855 --> 10:05.795
You're a beautiful
little one, aren't you?

10:05.915 --> 10:08.255
Aren't you a beautiful little girl?

10:08.395 --> 10:10.495
Thank you.

10:12.075 --> 10:14.015
You're welcome.

10:19.116 --> 10:21.016
Jack, good to see you.

10:21.156 --> 10:22.836
Hey, I heard you resigned.

10:23.016 --> 10:25.056
- Did you?
- Yeah.

10:25.256 --> 10:27.016
- But you're back?
- Yep.

10:27.156 --> 10:28.696
Back for good, or...

10:28.896 --> 10:31.836
It's hard to keep up with you.

10:33.736 --> 10:36.756
Hey, listen, I wanna tell you
something as a friend, as a mate.

10:36.876 --> 10:38.076
What?

10:39.136 --> 10:43.136
Some people think you're...
overstepping the mark a bit.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.976
Be careful. Okay? Be careful.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.536
Don't... don't bite off
more than you can chew.

10:49.676 --> 10:50.876
Know my place.

10:52.556 --> 10:54.416
Those were not my words.

10:54.616 --> 10:57.696
I don't want that being repeated
around the production office,

10:57.896 --> 11:00.296
because seriously they... not my words.

11:01.416 --> 11:02.896
Hey.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.656
I am dying over this shirt
and dying over you in it.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.856
#I'mDead.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.176
You have a grandchild!

11:24.316 --> 11:26.496
That's wonderful.

11:31.196 --> 11:34.116
- Grandpa's here.
- And Uncle Bernard, oh...

11:36.016 --> 11:37.816
- I think I'll head off.
- Okay, yeah.

11:37.976 --> 11:39.811
- Let's catch up soon, though.
- Thank you, Bernard.

11:39.816 --> 11:41.696
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you for everything.

11:41.836 --> 11:43.396
No, it's totally my pleasure.

11:43.596 --> 11:44.836
- I'm gonna text you.
- Okay.

11:45.016 --> 11:46.216
- Okay?
- Yep.

11:46.336 --> 11:49.496
- 'Bye. Thank you for everything.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:58.336 --> 12:02.576
- Did she have the baby?
- Mitchell. Hi, um...

12:02.776 --> 12:04.896
- Everything go okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

12:05.096 --> 12:07.016
- What did they have?
- They had a little girl.

12:07.156 --> 12:10.496
Wow! That's great.

12:12.256 --> 12:15.336
- Is Meredith all right?
- Everyone's happy and healthy.

12:19.456 --> 12:22.296
- I'm sure you can go in and see them.
- No, no, there's no need.

12:22.496 --> 12:24.656
I just wanted to make sure
everything went... well.

12:24.796 --> 12:26.136
Okay.

12:26.276 --> 12:27.896
That's all.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.856
Okay, work.

12:47.816 --> 12:52.496
- How did it go?
- It was so hectic.

12:58.576 --> 13:01.111
Hello, Graeme, nice to meet you.
Welcome to the show.

13:01.136 --> 13:04.336
Hi, I love you on the show.
I wish you weren't a lesbian.

13:04.536 --> 13:05.976
- Oh, thanks.
- Five.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.856
Four, three, two...

13:08.996 --> 13:10.296
Welcome back.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.816
And look who we have here,
it's Graeme Bloomquist,

13:13.016 --> 13:15.576
who has one of the best coin
collections in all of Melbourne.

13:15.716 --> 13:17.056
Yes, indeed.

13:17.256 --> 13:20.776
So tell us, Graeme, when did you
start this amazing collection?

13:22.256 --> 13:23.456
Uh...

13:31.476 --> 13:34.856
A car crash. I'm watching a car
crash, and not the fun kind.

13:35.056 --> 13:36.616
Erica, get him off. Throw to Hamilton.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.496
Thank you so much for that, Graeme.

13:38.516 --> 13:40.136
Absolutely fascinating.

13:40.336 --> 13:42.856
Hamilton, what's happening
with this crazy weather?

13:43.056 --> 13:45.016
Okay, Jack, are you ready?

13:45.216 --> 13:47.016
We're gonna go to
Hamilton and then to you.

13:47.216 --> 13:49.371
- There's a cold front...
- Erica, we're on the weather.

13:49.376 --> 13:51.136
So you can safely move
across to the kitchen.

13:51.256 --> 13:53.976
Are you kidding me, Hamilton?
No, I love a laugh.

13:54.176 --> 13:57.536
But I don't joke around about the
weather. Never have, never will.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.116
But a cold front, for
those wondering at home,

14:00.236 --> 14:01.936
is when a mass of cold air

14:02.136 --> 14:05.396
replaces a mass of warm air
that was there before.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.591
We've gotta find
a better way to do that.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.536
I've just stripped all
the tan off my knees.

14:09.736 --> 14:12.176
When a cold front
arrives, temperatures can drop...

14:12.216 --> 14:13.831
- Hi.
- Do you wanna take over?

14:13.836 --> 14:15.576
No, but I'll speak to Jack.

14:15.776 --> 14:18.856
- It's fine. I've got it sorted.
- I will speak to Jack.

14:18.996 --> 14:20.896
Camera one on Jack, please.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.216
So, Jack, what's on
the agenda for today?

14:23.416 --> 14:25.036
I'm gonna show you a
delicious vegan dish

14:25.236 --> 14:26.776
that I often make for myself at home.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.216
Sounds lovely.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.456
Jack, what are some of the
advantages of veganism?

14:30.596 --> 14:32.176
Well, there are three main ones.

14:32.316 --> 14:33.756
Firstly, the most obvious one

14:33.956 --> 14:36.336
is that no animal dies
in order for us to eat.

14:36.536 --> 14:40.313
Secondly, most vegan diets are
healthier than those including meat.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.591
Of course.

14:41.616 --> 14:42.768
And, thirdly, it
benefits the environment.

14:42.854 --> 14:45.336
Cattle farming is not
environmentally friendly.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.776
There's something else I'd like to
share with the viewers this morning.

14:48.976 --> 14:51.336
- Okay.
- I'm leaving 'The Breakfast Bar'.

14:52.936 --> 14:55.496
- What?
- No!

14:57.076 --> 14:59.776
Absolutely perfect.

14:59.976 --> 15:02.476
- What have we got?
- We've still got the coin guy.

15:02.656 --> 15:04.756
- Go back to the coin guy.
- He's frozen.

15:04.876 --> 15:05.816
Just do it.

15:06.016 --> 15:11.656
Eric? Pick up a coin and talk about
it and describe it in detail.

15:11.856 --> 15:14.136
- Camera one.
- Bloody hell.

15:14.336 --> 15:17.036
Very impressed by the little
silver ones there with the hole.

15:17.236 --> 15:19.816
They're like... they're
like little doughnuts.

15:20.016 --> 15:22.896
Aren't they? Without
the icing, obviously.

15:24.656 --> 15:27.056
Jack, I know you've just said
you're leaving the show,

15:27.256 --> 15:29.576
but I want you to say
that it was a joke.

15:29.716 --> 15:31.056
I know you're discontented,

15:31.256 --> 15:33.496
but you cannot make decisions
like this live on air.

15:33.696 --> 15:37.216
We can talk about this
after the show, please.

15:37.416 --> 15:40.536
We'll only go to Jack for 30 seconds.
So, can you have a backup package ready?

15:40.676 --> 15:42.116
No worries. What have we got?

15:42.296 --> 15:44.976
Can you write up a line about
Jack going away for a week?

15:45.176 --> 15:47.336
We've got '10 Common Laundry Mistakes'

15:47.536 --> 15:49.336
or 'Is Your Dog Smarter
Than Your Spouse?'

15:49.476 --> 15:51.256
Go with the dog.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.176
Jack, I'm gonna feed you a line.

15:58.376 --> 16:01.336
Erica, I want you to listen so
you can prepare a response.

16:01.536 --> 16:04.056
"I was just having you on before, Erica.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.056
"I'm taking tomorrow off

16:06.256 --> 16:08.616
"to go to a farmer's market
on the North Coast."

16:08.756 --> 16:10.416
So, Jack, tell me,

16:10.616 --> 16:12.751
are you really leaving 'The
Breakfast Bar' or are you off...

16:12.756 --> 16:14.136
He's taken his earpiece out.

16:14.336 --> 16:16.291
- on some foodie adventure?
- Ah, well, both.

16:16.296 --> 16:18.116
I'm keen to explore
veganism a bit further

16:18.296 --> 16:20.116
and to do that I'll be leaving the show.

16:20.296 --> 16:21.891
- No, no, no.
- What about your restaurant?

16:21.896 --> 16:23.296
- Will that keep going?
- Of course.

16:23.396 --> 16:25.116
You'll always be welcome there.

16:25.236 --> 16:27.536
Look, but I do wanna say thank you

16:27.736 --> 16:30.496
to the many, many viewers
who have contacted me

16:30.696 --> 16:33.776
or said hello to me in the street
or come to the restaurant.

16:33.916 --> 16:36.656
I appreciate you and always will.

16:39.056 --> 16:42.256
Well, I, for one, am gonna
miss you like crazy.

16:42.456 --> 16:45.296
- Is the package ready to go?
- Yep.

16:45.496 --> 16:49.336
Erica, throw to Eric and the brainy dog.

16:49.536 --> 16:51.171
- What's he doing?
- Well done, mate.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.856
It's wonderful to hear you've got
so many other things going on.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.496
Eric, throw to the dog!

16:55.696 --> 16:59.296
- You know, you'll be missed here.
- Eric, throw to the dog!

16:59.496 --> 17:02.116
You know what, Erica? Might be time
for me to get in the kitchen.

17:02.296 --> 17:05.175
- I don't think so.
- Is his intro on Autocue?

17:05.376 --> 17:08.136
I might even have you over
for dinner one night.

17:08.336 --> 17:10.856
- See if I can't teach you...
- Eric, you read your Autocue.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.675
I'm sure you, ah... you
could, you already have.

17:13.796 --> 17:15.136
Right now, Eric!

17:17.175 --> 17:21.215
And coming up next, is your dog
smarter than your husband?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.816
You might be surprised by the answer!

17:24.016 --> 17:26.695
We'll see you soon.

17:26.836 --> 17:28.756
And we're clear.

17:30.176 --> 17:33.816
What? What the hell is going on?
Anyone? Lily!

17:36.576 --> 17:39.696
- I am so glad I'm not you.
- Craig's on the landline.

17:39.896 --> 17:42.416
I can't speak to him.
I have to get to the studio.

17:43.178 --> 17:46.095
Don't be put off by how that
looks. That's actually pretty good.

17:46.418 --> 17:47.838
Where's Jack?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.678
Who's Jack?

17:53.498 --> 17:54.838
Is Jack around?

17:55.038 --> 17:57.038
Ah, he really wants
to be alone right now.

17:57.078 --> 17:59.998
- So he's here? Where is he?
- I think I should talk to him first.

18:00.198 --> 18:02.838
He just really needs to find his
still centre and your energy is...

18:03.038 --> 18:05.938
Nikkii, if you don't tell me where
he is by the time I count to three,

18:06.138 --> 18:08.598
I'm taking you permanently off
all fashion and style stories

18:08.798 --> 18:10.838
and I'll have you reporting
on federal politics

18:11.038 --> 18:12.598
for the rest of your television career.

18:12.618 --> 18:14.158
He's in the green room!

18:15.778 --> 18:17.218
What the hell was that?

18:17.418 --> 18:19.538
You promised me you would do
the show, then we'd talk.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.478
- I did the show, now we're talking.
- And what?

18:21.498 --> 18:23.318
You were trying to
sabotage me personally?

18:23.518 --> 18:25.398
I just wanted it over, now it's over.

18:25.598 --> 18:29.038
Why? Why did you have
to do that live on air?

18:29.238 --> 18:30.998
I've been thinking about
this for some time.

18:31.198 --> 18:34.158
But I just need to get away and
take a break from the show.

18:35.718 --> 18:37.318
And from you.

19:11.658 --> 19:13.038
Lily.

19:13.178 --> 19:15.958
I didn't know he was gonna say that.

19:16.158 --> 19:17.998
Well, I assumed that,
but why did he say it?

19:18.138 --> 19:19.838
He doesn't want to do the show.

19:20.038 --> 19:22.478
I get that, but why was he
allowed to say it on air?

19:22.678 --> 19:26.758
I can't control everything, every
tiny thing that everybody says.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.758
Well, that's pretty much
your job description,

19:28.958 --> 19:30.598
to control what people say on this show.

19:30.798 --> 19:32.958
That's why we have writers,
that's why we have scripts.

19:33.078 --> 19:36.238
I don't know what to tell you.

19:36.378 --> 19:38.878
I didn't want him to leave the show.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.678
There is gonna be major
repercussions on this,

19:41.878 --> 19:43.718
and most of it is gonna
land on your head.

19:43.918 --> 19:46.998
We've got an ad campaign worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars

19:47.138 --> 19:49.578
all based on Jack Winters!

19:49.778 --> 19:52.798
From now on, every little
segment, every little thing

19:52.998 --> 19:55.078
that goes through your
head, you run by me, okay?

19:55.278 --> 19:59.398
- How will that help?
- It'll help you keep your job. Maybe.

20:08.238 --> 20:10.298
- Hello, Grandpa.
- Oh! Hey!

20:10.478 --> 20:11.858
I know!

20:12.058 --> 20:14.478
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:14.618 --> 20:15.938
Oh!

20:16.118 --> 20:17.678
- Oh, no, you can't go in.
- Oh?

20:17.878 --> 20:20.358
The midwife's in there...
doing something.

20:20.558 --> 20:23.318
- Right. So how are you feeling?
- Oh, great.

20:23.518 --> 20:25.878
It's, uh... I mean, it's
really, really exciting.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.718
I know.

20:27.858 --> 20:29.398
Um...

20:29.538 --> 20:31.958
Lily, now might be a good time

20:32.158 --> 20:34.358
to give Pete and his
girlfriend a bit of space.

20:34.498 --> 20:36.038
What do you...

20:36.238 --> 20:38.358
What do you mean?

20:38.558 --> 20:41.378
I mean, Pete needs to
be free to be a dad,

20:41.498 --> 20:44.318
he doesn't need... distractions.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.938
Sometimes...

20:49.998 --> 20:53.438
when a new baby comes into
the house, it...

20:53.638 --> 20:57.718
there can be pressure, so it
might be time to back off a bit.

21:00.118 --> 21:05.718
I don't think I get in the way of
Meredith and Pete's relationship. Do I?

21:05.858 --> 21:07.878
I don't think you mean to.

21:11.698 --> 21:13.238
Okay?

21:13.378 --> 21:15.118
We can go in now.

21:15.258 --> 21:16.998
Ohh.

21:17.198 --> 21:19.479
- G'day, mate.
- Hey, Dad.

21:21.398 --> 21:23.878
Couldn't sleep. Thought I'd pop back in.

21:24.078 --> 21:25.638
- Hey, come in.
- Hi.

21:25.778 --> 21:27.518
Come meet your god-daughter, Manisha.

21:36.038 --> 21:40.398
She's beautiful, Pete. Really gorgeous.

21:40.598 --> 21:42.218
- You wanna hold her?
- No, no, no.

21:42.418 --> 21:44.278
- I don't wanna disturb her.
- Sure?

21:44.478 --> 21:46.958
- Where's Meredith?
- She's at a bathing class.

21:48.938 --> 21:50.318
What you got there, Dad?

21:50.518 --> 21:52.878
I thought I'd get her into
the game early, you know.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.758
I won't stay, I'll let you
guys have some family time.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.878
- Wait until Meredith gets back.
- No, no, no.

21:59.078 --> 22:00.938
I really... I have to go, but well done.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.638
What are you doing here?

22:21.838 --> 22:24.598
I know... I know, you
wanna be left alone

22:24.798 --> 22:27.718
and I promise I am,
I'm gonna leave you alone,

22:27.918 --> 22:31.038
but I just, um,
I wanted to give you this.

22:33.198 --> 22:35.638
It was meant to be
for your birthday, but...

22:35.838 --> 22:38.858
now I'm probably not gonna
see you on your birthday, so...

22:40.518 --> 22:42.578
You don't... you don't
have to open it now.

22:42.758 --> 22:46.998
I also... I just wanted
to say one last time...

22:48.338 --> 22:50.758
I wish I didn't lie about Jack.

22:52.498 --> 22:56.158
And I am really, really sorry.

22:56.298 --> 22:58.578
I'm sorry about everything.

23:06.438 --> 23:07.938
The...

23:08.058 --> 23:11.858
The stupid thing is I didn't tell you

23:12.058 --> 23:16.238
because... I was scared
of losing our friendship.

23:16.378 --> 23:20.478
And then... I lost you anyway.

23:23.978 --> 23:25.438
Are you with Jack?

23:28.978 --> 23:30.318
No.

23:33.638 --> 23:35.598
Do you want to be?

23:39.938 --> 23:41.578
I don't know.

23:45.238 --> 23:47.718
Promise... promise you'll open it.

24:15.046 --> 24:17.106
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:19.226 --> 24:20.646
Why are you here?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.246
To say goodbye.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.686
I feel like we were never
really able to meet.

24:32.486 --> 24:35.846
We were always... missing.

24:38.366 --> 24:41.246
- When do you leave?
- Saturday.

24:43.126 --> 24:47.286
- I don't want you to go.
- Come with me.

24:47.426 --> 24:49.466
See if there's anything between us,

24:49.666 --> 24:52.406
away from work and everything,
just the two of us.

24:56.766 --> 24:58.966
Why would you want me to go with you?

24:59.166 --> 25:01.766
You don't seem to like me
very much most of the time.

25:01.906 --> 25:04.406
No, I like you too much.

25:04.606 --> 25:08.486
I like the way you press your
nose to stop yourself laughing.

25:08.686 --> 25:12.726
I like the way you push food
into your mouth when you eat.

25:12.926 --> 25:17.926
I like the way you see the best in
everyone rather than the worst.

25:20.046 --> 25:22.966
I have responsibilities here.
I can't just take off on a whim.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.606
A whim?

25:28.966 --> 25:30.466
Okay.

25:33.826 --> 25:36.566
I've got stuff to do.

25:47.526 --> 25:51.566
I thought I was going to be speaking
about feet accessories this morning

25:51.706 --> 25:54.166
and then I found this.

25:54.366 --> 25:57.526
I know Jack has just left us and
I don't wanna speak ill of the dead.

25:57.726 --> 26:01.046
- He's not dead.
- But this guy is amazing.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.526
Totally hot, totally committed.

26:03.666 --> 26:06.606
210,000 Instagram followers.

26:06.746 --> 26:08.206
Great body, perfect for the show.

26:08.406 --> 26:10.886
- What does he do?
- Does it matter? Look at him.

26:12.586 --> 26:14.526
I'm kidding! Okay, you ready?

26:14.666 --> 26:17.166
He's a celebrity fitness trainer.

26:17.366 --> 26:19.561
Do you mean he's a celebrity
or he trains celebrities?

26:19.566 --> 26:21.406
- Both!
- Sweet.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.826
Follow him up.

26:24.006 --> 26:27.326
Eric, you said you wanted
to pitch something.

26:29.666 --> 26:31.006
Yes.

26:32.486 --> 26:34.126
Yes, I'd love to.

26:35.526 --> 26:37.486
I know at the moment
people are very interested

26:37.626 --> 26:39.606
in dating and reality shows,

26:39.806 --> 26:44.606
so I thought we could do a
mini reality segment each week

26:44.746 --> 26:47.006
about my dating love life.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.646
- I'd watch that.
- I wouldn't.

26:51.286 --> 26:54.826
Each week, viewers would pitch
themselves for a date with me,

26:55.006 --> 26:57.286
and, of course, each
week I'd go on a date

26:57.426 --> 27:00.826
with the view to find Miss Right.

27:00.946 --> 27:03.006
I'd love to produce that.

27:03.146 --> 27:05.846
Eric, aren't you married?

27:05.986 --> 27:07.966
Was.

27:08.166 --> 27:12.166
It's very hard to combine a
high-powered career with marriage.

27:17.406 --> 27:20.286
It's very hard to combine being
an arsehole with marriage.

27:20.486 --> 27:23.466
Alice, if you're interested in
producing that, I'll leave it to you.

27:23.586 --> 27:25.006
Nikkii, you work with her.

27:25.206 --> 27:27.566
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm. Cool.

27:35.126 --> 27:37.606
Lily? Hey.

27:37.806 --> 27:39.606
You do realise that I won't be any part

27:39.806 --> 27:41.926
of an Eric dating segment, don't you?

27:42.126 --> 27:44.126
I just feel like I would
have failed as a feminist

27:44.266 --> 27:45.846
if I inflicted him on another woman.

27:46.046 --> 27:47.846
Let's just let it settle
and see what happens.

27:47.946 --> 27:49.226
Ah, there you are.

27:49.426 --> 27:51.826
Before you set me up with any
girls, I'll need to see photos.

27:51.886 --> 27:55.006
- You'll get a full bio, Eric.
- No bios, just photos.

27:55.206 --> 27:56.966
When I think I couldn't
dislike him any more,

27:57.066 --> 27:58.566
he does something to prove me wrong.

27:58.766 --> 28:01.806
- Lily. Craig wants to speak to you.
- Mmm. Thanks, Alice.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.746
No, no, he means in person.

28:10.966 --> 28:14.286
So, I've got some great ideas
for the Eric dating segment.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.886
Should I only choose women his age

28:16.086 --> 28:17.966
or should I go older
and younger as well?

28:18.166 --> 28:20.326
Yeah, my idea is that I
introduce him to some women

28:20.526 --> 28:23.286
that he wouldn't typically go
for, you know, artistic people...

28:23.426 --> 28:24.926
What do you think?

28:25.126 --> 28:27.046
Please tell Craig I've gone home sick.

28:32.246 --> 28:34.386
Hey. Shh. Manisha's asleep. Come in.

28:36.246 --> 28:38.566
- Is Meredith here?
- Oh, she's asleep as well.

28:41.046 --> 28:42.766
How's it all going?

28:42.906 --> 28:45.166
Oh, yeah, it's pretty good.

28:45.366 --> 28:48.246
It's weird thinking about
someone other than yourself.

28:48.446 --> 28:51.166
I imagine that would be
quite challenging for you.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.246
You know, it's so odd to say,

28:55.446 --> 28:57.746
but I feel like I love her
and I'd do anything for her

28:57.946 --> 28:59.886
and I've only known her
for a couple of days.

29:10.186 --> 29:13.046
There's, um... there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

29:14.766 --> 29:17.246
Jack's asked me to go away with him.

29:17.386 --> 29:20.246
Go away for what?

29:20.446 --> 29:23.006
For a holiday. A long holiday.
A few months.

29:24.186 --> 29:27.386
- You're not gonna go, are you?
- No, I real... I want to.

29:27.586 --> 29:31.046
Oh, I think that would be
a big mistake, Lil, huge.

29:31.246 --> 29:32.746
- Okay.
- I mean, think about it.

29:32.946 --> 29:35.686
- You don't really know him.
- I do know him. I know him well.

29:35.886 --> 29:37.761
- He's leaving on the weekend.
- Are you serious?

29:37.786 --> 29:40.306
You went to Bali for a week and
took three months to plan it.

29:40.486 --> 29:42.046
And now you're thinking about going off

29:42.166 --> 29:44.106
to God knows where with
this guy in two days?

29:44.306 --> 29:46.526
I'm considering it.
Please stop judging me.

29:46.726 --> 29:49.126
Well, don't do things
that trigger judgement.

29:49.326 --> 29:52.246
What, Pete? You? You
have everything, okay?

29:52.446 --> 29:54.646
You've got a beautiful
little baby and a partner.

29:54.846 --> 29:56.606
I sometimes think us hanging out so much

29:56.806 --> 29:58.646
has stopped me from meeting
my special someone.

29:58.766 --> 30:00.981
- Well, clearly it hasn't.
- Why are you being like this?

30:00.986 --> 30:02.306
Because throwing away your career

30:02.406 --> 30:04.841
and running off with someone you
barely know is stupid and foolhardy.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.326
Have you had some sort of brain snap?

30:06.526 --> 30:08.746
Why are you being such a
prick about this, Pete?

30:08.946 --> 30:11.766
Whenever you've had difficult
situations with women, I've listened.

30:11.906 --> 30:13.446
Now I come to you for advice

30:13.646 --> 30:16.006
about someone I think I might
actually be in love with...

30:16.206 --> 30:19.746
Love? Two seconds ago, he
was loving your flatmate!

30:21.606 --> 30:23.406
I've put up with so much shit from you.

30:23.546 --> 30:25.746
- Like what?
- Like you sleeping with me

30:25.946 --> 30:28.126
when you're in love with
someone else who was pregnant.

30:28.151 --> 30:29.681
- I didn't know she was pregnant.
- Remember that?

30:29.706 --> 30:31.789
I can remember a few
others but that tops it.

30:31.814 --> 30:34.070
You know what, go away with your guy
if that's what you want.

30:34.095 --> 30:36.021
But don't worry about your
new little god-daughter,

30:36.026 --> 30:37.386
don't worry about your career,

30:37.586 --> 30:39.606
and I'm sure you'll enjoy
a break from me as well.

30:39.736 --> 30:41.376
- I really will.
- Good.

31:22.308 --> 31:24.588
No, I am happy for her if she's happy.

31:24.788 --> 31:26.728
I just think she's making
a mistake, that's all.

31:26.848 --> 31:28.308
But it's her mistake to make, so...

31:28.508 --> 31:30.948
I think if she's in love,
then why not go for it?

31:31.148 --> 31:34.508
Is she in love? I don't know.
I don't think she's in love.

31:34.708 --> 31:36.648
It doesn't really matter
what you think, does it?

31:36.768 --> 31:38.748
It matters what she thinks.

31:41.728 --> 31:45.828
Oh, don't fester about it, Pete.
She's your best friend.

31:48.768 --> 31:50.228
Come in, Ivan.

31:50.368 --> 31:51.828
Hi.

31:52.028 --> 31:53.648
Dad.

31:53.848 --> 31:55.748
Granddad's here. That's
your granddad here.

31:55.948 --> 31:59.868
- Do you wanna have a cuddle?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

32:00.008 --> 32:02.548
Hey. Go to Grandpa.

32:02.748 --> 32:04.368
- You got her arm?
- Yeah.

32:04.568 --> 32:06.108
Hey.

32:06.308 --> 32:08.788
- She suits you.
- Thank you.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.948
I'm gonna get dressed.

32:18.468 --> 32:20.808
Been a long time since I've held a baby.

32:24.968 --> 32:26.428
Whoa.

32:26.568 --> 32:28.188
Ooh, someone's done a poo.

32:28.328 --> 32:30.288
Sorry about that.

32:30.488 --> 32:34.388
Pass her here. We'll put her down.
That's the way. There you go.

32:34.528 --> 32:36.648
Someone done a big poo for Dad.

32:36.848 --> 32:38.428
Huh?

32:38.568 --> 32:41.288
You've done a big stinky poo.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.588
Why do you have all these covers on?

32:47.348 --> 32:49.288
- Okay.
- She's her father's daughter.

32:49.408 --> 32:51.648
Wasn't that bad, was I?

32:53.348 --> 32:55.668
There we go, get these off.

32:59.788 --> 33:01.668
Proud of you.

33:01.868 --> 33:04.648
- Proud of the man you are.
- Oh.

33:04.768 --> 33:06.308
Thanks, Dad.

33:10.308 --> 33:12.288
So, I went to the doctor last week.

33:12.488 --> 33:16.368
- Oh, yeah? What's wrong?
- Haven't been feeling too good.

33:16.488 --> 33:18.508
What do you mean?

33:18.708 --> 33:21.028
Well, I've been getting
these headaches and, ah...

33:22.728 --> 33:24.948
feeling pretty angry all the time.

33:25.148 --> 33:28.228
I know I've gone off at you a few
times when you haven't deserved it.

33:28.368 --> 33:30.548
I'm all right, Dad, I'm a big boy.

33:33.188 --> 33:35.468
Anyways, he said all those
years of playing footy...

33:35.668 --> 33:38.188
might have done some damage to my brain.

33:38.388 --> 33:40.468
I used to hit the ground pretty hard.

33:40.668 --> 33:43.668
- Yeah, but that was a long time ago.
- Yeah, I know, I told him that.

33:48.588 --> 33:54.068
He's, uh, sending me to this brain
specialist in a couple of weeks.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.708
Ah...

33:56.908 --> 33:59.148
Well, I mean, I-I can go
with you if you want.

34:06.788 --> 34:09.708
- Can I have a cuddle?
- Yeah, sure.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.868
Here.

34:14.868 --> 34:16.947
Oh, Dad.

34:26.547 --> 34:31.148
You come and go and you
stay as you please

34:31.348 --> 34:36.027
Convinced a moment's
time is all that I need

34:36.228 --> 34:39.308
These temporary highs
can't make me believe...

34:39.447 --> 34:41.188
Oh, hello, hello.

34:41.388 --> 34:44.148
- That your feelings are true...
- Here, Dad.

34:44.288 --> 34:45.947
I'd like a glass.

34:46.088 --> 34:49.027
Holding out your hand

34:49.168 --> 34:51.068
While you turn your head

34:51.208 --> 34:53.868
I don't want half of your love

34:56.668 --> 34:58.948
Empty words you've said

34:59.088 --> 35:01.288
Bare unravelled thread

35:01.408 --> 35:04.308
You know it's never enough

35:06.308 --> 35:08.588
You can't love me this way

35:08.728 --> 35:10.508
You can't keep me in chains

35:10.648 --> 35:13.948
Ooh-ooh ohhh

35:15.948 --> 35:18.468
You can't lead me astray...

35:18.668 --> 35:20.708
- Oh, what's wrong?
- From an arm's length away

35:20.908 --> 35:23.928
- Ooh-ooh ohhh...
- Oh, what's wrong, hey?

35:24.128 --> 35:26.008
What have you got, eh?

35:26.188 --> 35:30.428
You search for breathing
space while I'm undersea

35:30.628 --> 35:36.068
Tell me to wait so you can
sort through your needs

35:36.268 --> 35:40.428
Keep leaving trails that
you'll follow to me

35:40.628 --> 35:45.148
- I can't let you get through...
- Home renter.

35:45.348 --> 35:48.068
- Your palace!
- Holding out your hand

35:48.208 --> 35:50.668
While you turn your head

35:50.868 --> 35:54.828
- I don't want half of your love...
- Missed my hand.

35:56.028 --> 35:58.148
- Help!
- Empty words you've said

35:58.288 --> 36:00.228
Bare unravelled thread

36:00.428 --> 36:04.148
- You know it's never enough...
- Hey! Hey! Help!

36:04.348 --> 36:06.743
I never thought I'd hear
your mother say those words.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.708
Could you just say that
again for us, darl?

36:09.908 --> 36:11.948
She shouldn't be hungry. I just fed her.

36:12.148 --> 36:14.708
Yeah, I think she just
needed a big cuddle.

36:14.848 --> 36:16.228
Don't you? Yeah.

36:16.428 --> 36:18.043
You can lead me astray...

36:18.048 --> 36:19.828
From an arm's length away

36:19.968 --> 36:22.828
Ooh-ooh ohhh

36:25.988 --> 36:29.588
Your absence won't define me now...

36:29.728 --> 36:30.948
I love you.

36:31.148 --> 36:34.348
Held up my end with
breath I've found

36:35.768 --> 36:38.828
Surrendered time to solid ground

36:41.128 --> 36:45.028
Solid ground

36:45.168 --> 36:47.468
You can't love me this way...

36:47.668 --> 36:50.788
- I have an announcement to make.
- Ooh.

36:52.368 --> 36:54.708
I resigned from my job today.

36:54.848 --> 36:56.388
What?

36:56.588 --> 36:59.588
You can't love me this way
You can't keep me in chains

36:59.788 --> 37:02.788
Ooh-ooh ohhh...

37:05.208 --> 37:07.348
You can't leave me astray...

37:14.948 --> 37:17.288
Are you in love with me, Meredith?

37:20.908 --> 37:23.708
I'm in love with the
family we've created.

37:57.295 --> 37:58.995
Best present ever.

38:08.895 --> 38:11.755
That's both a good and a bad
thing because now I don't know

38:11.955 --> 38:14.355
what I'm gonna get you
for your actual birthday.

38:23.815 --> 38:25.715
I made you this.

38:30.735 --> 38:32.355
Thank you.

38:40.095 --> 38:42.075
Follow your heart.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.555
Sim.

38:51.555 --> 38:52.915
Hey.

38:54.475 --> 38:55.652
I'm glad you're here

38:55.677 --> 38:58.535
because I have no idea
where the breakfast bowls are.

38:58.735 --> 39:01.595
Did you put them with the oblong
receptacles or the circular ones?

39:04.835 --> 39:06.795
- Circular.
- Okay.

39:06.995 --> 39:09.175
Do I have to talk you
through this again?

39:09.295 --> 39:12.175
Could we? Could you show me?

39:18.375 --> 39:20.595
I put them over here.

39:40.175 --> 39:43.195
I've got something to tell you.

39:45.655 --> 39:48.315
Two thumbs up, palm tree emoji.

39:53.615 --> 39:55.555
So you're just gonna take off on a whim?

39:55.695 --> 39:57.635
Sure am.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.275
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:16.415 --> 40:19.115
So, I take it you're leaving, then?

40:19.255 --> 40:21.315
What do you want, Pete?

40:21.455 --> 40:23.915
This is for you.

40:27.755 --> 40:30.075
'The Evolution of Radiohead'.

40:31.255 --> 40:33.555
- You finished it.
- Yep.

40:33.755 --> 40:38.395
And I-I wanted to explain
why I reacted the way I did.

40:38.535 --> 40:40.315
Oh, I know that.

40:40.515 --> 40:43.835
It's because I'm stupid
and foolhardy, was that right?

40:44.035 --> 40:46.075
Yeah, no, that's... that's
pretty much right.

40:46.275 --> 40:51.755
But I also reacted the way I did
because... I don't want you to go.

40:53.355 --> 40:55.895
- That I...
- No, no, no. Shh. No. Stop. No.

40:56.015 --> 40:57.555
You can't just... No, no, no,

40:57.755 --> 41:00.190
You cannot put something on the
table that you can't take back.

41:00.195 --> 41:03.715
- I wanna put it on the table.
- If we had a moment, it's passed.

41:03.915 --> 41:06.035
- Please let me say it. Let me say it.
- It's passed.

41:06.235 --> 41:08.955
- Let me say it. Let me say it.
- Move...

41:15.675 --> 41:17.535
I always thought a best friend was

41:17.715 --> 41:20.115
the person you most liked being around,

41:20.315 --> 41:22.995
you know, the person that made you
the best version of yourself,

41:23.195 --> 41:26.395
the person you thought of first
when something bad happened,

41:26.595 --> 41:29.175
the person you thought of first
when something good happened,

41:29.375 --> 41:31.715
and that's... that's
how I feel about you.

41:34.395 --> 41:38.675
But then I realised that's not how
you feel about a best friend,

41:38.875 --> 41:42.235
that's-that's how you feel about
someone you're in love with.

41:44.895 --> 41:46.555
And...

41:46.755 --> 41:50.635
Everyone told me that when a baby's
born, it's not about you anymore,

41:50.835 --> 41:53.895
and I never understood
that, but now I do.

41:54.015 --> 41:56.835
It's... it's about Manisha.

41:57.035 --> 42:02.115
But I had to tell you how I
felt before you went away.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.275
I'm in love with you.

42:17.655 --> 42:19.195
Have a great trip.

42:25.255 --> 42:26.455
- Hey.
- Mate.

42:26.555 --> 42:28.475
- Congratulations on the baby.
- Oh, thanks.

42:28.675 --> 42:31.475
- I hear you're... you're going away.
- Off on an adventure.

42:31.675 --> 42:34.075
- Well, look after her for me.
- Will do.

43:11.535 --> 43:13.455
I love you.
