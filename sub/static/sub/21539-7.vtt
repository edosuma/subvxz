00:05.372 --> 00:07.173
I'd like us to take
the next step...

00:08.274 --> 00:12.212
We want to ask you
if you would give

00:12.245 --> 00:13.747
your eggs to us.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.049
My eggs?

00:16.082 --> 00:18.151
No, they're my eggs.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.754
Emilia called me.
It was a no.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.122
Wow, this is beautiful.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.423
White Carrara marble.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.758
It's Carrara Marlboro.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.394
Did you say "Marlboro"?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.896
You have radiant heat, so no one
will ever have cold feet.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.931
Speaking of cold feet,
when's the wedding?

00:31.965 --> 00:33.933
What would be the coolest way
to propose?

00:33.967 --> 00:37.704
I'll just be like,
"Do you, R.D.--"

00:37.737 --> 00:39.105
Oh, God.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.641
You are the hardest guy to reach
on the face of this earth.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.077
Well, you have a monumental task
ahead of you,

00:44.110 --> 00:46.012
because there's no need
for us to speak to brokers.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.281
With all due respect,
you actually need me.

New York City,
it's the most exciting city

01:00.293 --> 01:02.195
for real estate,
and that's why I'm here.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.531
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.133
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.201
Whee!

01:08.234 --> 01:10.070
We're friends now,
right?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.405
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.540
This will never end.

- Good morning.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.553
Did you see the article?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.488
No, I haven't seen it.
Is it good?

01:28.521 --> 01:29.989
(Luis)
I promised my developer Gerard

01:30.090 --> 01:32.726
that the way to sell
his last townhouse in Brooklyn

01:32.759 --> 01:33.993
at the price that he wants

01:34.094 --> 01:35.628
is to appeal
to an international buyer.

01:35.662 --> 01:38.098
Send me the links
so that I can see them.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.766
How many articles
are we in?

01:39.799 --> 01:42.802
So I put together an event
for the media only.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.337
Good to see you.
Pleasure, pleasure.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.338
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

01:45.372 --> 01:46.639
All right.

01:46.673 --> 01:47.941
(Luis)
The idea was for the media

01:47.974 --> 01:50.176
to spread the word to everyone
about this property.

01:51.911 --> 01:52.912
Thank you.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.485
The response we got was amazing,
at least for most of us.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.054
You think they're really gonna
write on it tomorrow?

02:01.054 --> 02:02.889

Gerard's executive
vice president, Laura,

02:02.922 --> 02:05.058
has been very skeptical.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.562
Hopefully, this morning
I can change that.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.131
Okay, got it.

Holy sh**.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.744
Oh, my God.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.279
They're talking about food,
they're talking about fashion,

02:26.312 --> 02:27.514
they're talking
about architecture,

02:27.547 --> 02:28.982
they're talking
about the project itself,

02:29.082 --> 02:30.717
that it's 90% sold,
which is very good,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.218
that we have only one left.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.488
There's even one here
fully in Spanish,

02:35.522 --> 02:38.091
there's one in Italian,
and there's one in French.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.860
I should become a PR person.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.902
Let's see what Laura
has to say about this now.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.104
Okay, put an email together
with all the links,

02:51.137 --> 02:52.806
and put on the subject,

02:52.839 --> 02:55.108
"Everyone is talking about
The Townhouses of Cobble Hill."

02:55.108 --> 02:58.411
Put that the entire project
is 90% sold,

02:58.445 --> 03:00.447
one townhouse is left,
and then send this

03:00.480 --> 03:02.682
to all of Douglas Elliman,
to all of Corcoran,

03:02.716 --> 03:04.384
to all of Sotheby's,
to all of Brown Harris,

03:04.417 --> 03:06.119
to all of CORE,
to all of our clients,

03:06.152 --> 03:09.923
and let's share that bitch
like there was no tomorrow.

After my open house
at 82nd Street...

03:20.333 --> 03:22.602
It's four units,
six stories.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.971
I sold two more units.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.406
You sold the maisonette!
Yes!

03:26.439 --> 03:29.142
And that's on top of
my assistant pretending to be me

03:29.175 --> 03:32.212
and pulling off a miracle
and selling the maisonette.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.913
- I'm Ryan.
- Sam.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.250

Now I just have one unit left,
the upper duplex.

Hello?

03:39.853 --> 03:40.954

03:40.987 --> 03:42.622

Hey, man, how are you?

03:42.655 --> 03:43.690
What's your name?

03:43.723 --> 03:45.291
- Poselene.
- What's your name?

03:45.325 --> 03:46.960
What is that?
How do you say it?

- Greek.
- Yeah.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.302
Really?

03:56.336 --> 03:58.505
But I feel like I do.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.076
You want to go see
an apartment?

04:03.109 --> 04:04.210
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.645
- Let's go this way!
- Let's go.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.913
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.516
[boy screams]

04:09.549 --> 04:12.519
On the first floor, you have
the living room dining area

04:12.552 --> 04:14.854
that's a masonry
or gas fireplace.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.056
[screams]

04:16.089 --> 04:18.658
Maybe with him,
you don't have any fire.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.794
- [laughs]
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.831
(Ryan)
You have two bedrooms
at the end here.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.499
- Wait for Ryan.
- We're not going upstairs.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.734

04:27.767 --> 04:28.868
Hey, can you teach me
more Greek

04:28.902 --> 04:30.970
before we see
the rest of the apartment?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.205
<i>Pou p√°me.</i>
What does that mean?

04:37.844 --> 04:40.814
(Ryan)
Upstairs you have
your own personal master suite.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.916
You have one bathroom
here in the hallway,

04:42.949 --> 04:44.651
and then there's a laundry room
right next door,

04:44.684 --> 04:46.786
so as these little kids have
all their dirty clothes,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.321
you can just take it
right there--

04:48.355 --> 04:49.956
Yeah.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.459
- Dude, careful.
- [laughs]

04:52.492 --> 04:53.460
So since he's already
in the kitchen...

04:53.493 --> 04:54.461
Yes.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.829
This is your big,
open kitchen.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.764
Yeah.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.900
They coffered the ceilings,
and they've got built-in hi-hats

05:00.934 --> 05:02.769
and speakers
all over the place.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.704
It feels very comfortable.
It has great light.

(Ryan)
So do you think
it works for you?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.043

I like the openness,

05:10.043 --> 05:13.146
the homey feel,
all the new appliances.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.816
We're still looking
at a few units in the area.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.057
How do you say,
"What do you think?"

05:24.090 --> 05:25.492
That would be a very good thing
for me to know.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.296
Forget about<i>ti nomizete.</i>
Your girlfriend's Greek.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.531
You should try...

05:33.800 --> 05:35.068
It means,
"You're beautiful."

05:38.238 --> 05:39.906
- That's her nickname.
- Oh, oh.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.741
We don't have to talk
about nicknames.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.076
[laughs]

05:43.076 --> 05:44.644
The other thing I know how
to say in Greek is, um, uh...

05:45.712 --> 05:47.347
Which I think is, like,
"I love you," right?

05:47.380 --> 05:49.816
Who told you<i>me trelaineis</i>
means "I love you"?

05:49.849 --> 05:50.850
Emilia.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.088

all the time.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.374
Ahh, fresh Swedish air.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.410
Maybe I can bottle this pure air
and sell it in New York.

06:17.444 --> 06:20.347

06:20.380 --> 06:23.950
It's so nice to be home.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.286
Love you, handsome.
Have a good day.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.054
- Enjoy the art museum.
- Don't work too hard.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.457
I'm just gonna work
a little bit.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.491
Ahh!

(Fredrik)
Most people know me
as the number one

06:35.061 --> 06:37.797
real estate broker in New York,
but what they don't know

06:37.831 --> 06:39.866
is that I'm also
the founder and owner

06:39.899 --> 06:42.535
of a multinational luxury
real estate brokerage

06:42.569 --> 06:43.703

06:44.838 --> 06:46.573
[cheers and applause]

06:46.606 --> 06:49.309
I started Eklund Stockholm
New York five years ago,

06:49.342 --> 06:51.578
and we have expanded
and expanded and expanded.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.748
I have offices
in Stockholm, Oslo, London,

06:54.781 --> 06:57.817
and I'm about to open
in Helsinki, Finland.

Ahh, it feels so good
to be back!

06:59.652 --> 07:00.754

07:00.787 --> 07:02.889
We really captured
the luxury, luxury,

07:02.922 --> 07:04.457
highest end of the market.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.859
Good news for you.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.395
We want the first skyscraper
in Sweden ever.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.562
How many apartments?

07:09.596 --> 07:12.098
700. $40 million in commission
for the company.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.601
[laughter]

07:14.634 --> 07:16.169
I wanted to go
back to Sweden now

07:16.202 --> 07:19.039
because my company's been
working on a project

07:19.039 --> 07:20.707
for a while,
but I've actually

07:20.740 --> 07:23.109
never met my developer
face-to-face.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.544
So good to meet you finally.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.545
Good to meet you too.

07:25.578 --> 07:26.713

Nice to meet you.

07:26.746 --> 07:27.714
- Martin Randler, pleased--
- Hi, Martin.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.049
Should we sit down
and talk?

07:29.049 --> 07:32.285
I wanted to handle
the last and final sale

07:32.318 --> 07:33.920
in this project
personally

07:33.953 --> 07:36.523
to make sure it's done
with perfection.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.857
It's good to have you here.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.694
It feels good to be here.
I wish I could be here more.

07:40.727 --> 07:41.728
So...

07:43.163 --> 07:44.297
- Yes.
- Sunset Peak.

Sunset Peak is a new development
with seven luxury homes

07:52.072 --> 07:54.874
in the town of Are.

07:54.908 --> 07:59.179
Are in Sweden is
the most luxurious ski resort,

07:59.212 --> 08:01.114
with these beautiful chalets

08:01.147 --> 08:02.849
literally sitting
on the mountaintops.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.118
It's so incredibly beautiful.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.454
The first six I've sold,
but the last one--

08:07.487 --> 08:10.690
the most expensive one--
is waiting for me

08:10.724 --> 08:14.361
to come and wrap
an Eklund bow around.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.596
Sold.

08:16.629 --> 08:24.637
* *

08:33.346 --> 08:36.282
This home shows
perfect Swedish craftsmanship.

08:36.316 --> 08:41.154
It's warm, and it's inviting,
yet it's sleek and streamlined.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.657
The house is seven bedrooms,
four bathrooms,

08:44.691 --> 08:48.628
an enormous living area
with an open kitchen.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.830
The house is the perfect size
for a family

08:50.864 --> 08:52.399
or if you want to host
some friends

08:52.432 --> 08:54.267
coming up to ski
over the weekend.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.070
You know, you've been outside
all day, and it's cold,

08:57.070 --> 09:00.006
and then you come inside
and you go into the sauna,

09:00.006 --> 09:02.776
you cuddle up next to Derek,
and you know,

09:02.809 --> 09:05.812
one thing kind of leads
to another.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.285
So I'm gonna travel
up north tonight.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.421
I am gonna do some showings
myself.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.855
Okay, that's good,
that's good.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.657
We have a really good list
of people coming.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.027
Five families from Sweden
and five from Norwegian.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.028
Norway, Finland.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.229
From Finland as well, yeah.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.230
Anything from London?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.565
We have two people coming.

09:25.598 --> 09:27.634
(Fredrik)
Are is really a ski resort,

09:27.667 --> 09:28.768
so there are very few people
that actually

09:28.802 --> 09:30.103
live there year-round,

09:30.136 --> 09:33.039
so as with the previous houses
that were sold here,

09:33.039 --> 09:35.475
I'm gonna be marking this
as a vacation home,

09:35.508 --> 09:38.078
and I really need to go out
all over Europe

09:38.111 --> 09:40.313
to find that wealthy buyer.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.514
Let me ask you something,
Martin,

09:41.548 --> 09:43.283
what's the price that
you would accept?

09:43.316 --> 09:46.086
We've been calculating this,
and in order to get

09:46.119 --> 09:48.054
the real profits
for the next project,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.056
we can't go lower
than 11.7.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.825
- Full ask?
- Yeah.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.626
Martin wants me
to price the house

09:53.660 --> 09:58.798
at 11.7 million Swedish krona,
which is around $1.4 million.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.935
I mean, it might not sound
like a lot in the U.S.,

10:01.968 --> 10:05.105
but here in Are,
it's a complete record.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.908
11.7, the buyer can buy
a mansion in Spain

10:08.942 --> 10:11.011
or Italy in Tuscany,
so I have a feeling

10:11.044 --> 10:13.546
that really to get the price
of this last one,

10:13.580 --> 10:15.849
we need to sell
the environment.

10:15.882 --> 10:16.850
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.

10:16.883 --> 10:17.851
The resort of Are.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.652
The dream of winter wonderland.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.221
Yeah, yeah.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.756
(Fredrik)
Are is amazing
this time of year.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.257
There are so many activities
you can do.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.060
You can go hiking,
you can go skiing, you can go--

10:27.093 --> 10:29.829
oh, dogsledding.
I'm dying to go dogsledding.

10:29.863 --> 10:33.133
I'm gonna make Are
such a winter wonderland

10:33.166 --> 10:34.801
that the buyer is
just gonna imagine

10:34.834 --> 10:37.370
that Santa Claus is gonna be
their next-door neighbor.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.305
Okay.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.974
Full ask or nothing,
gentlemen.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.175
(all)
Yeah.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.576
- Thank you, Martin.
- Thank you.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.979
11.7 million.
I'm gonna make you proud.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.615
(Luis)
Coming up...

10:48.648 --> 10:51.618
I'd like to shut down
Times Square completely.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.423
We have something
really exciting to tell you.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.470
Good morning,
good morning.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.604
- Hello.
- How are you?

11:11.638 --> 11:13.406
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.808
- Mwah.
- Mm.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.776
A hug and a kiss?

11:16.810 --> 11:18.078
Somebody's been reading
the press.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.779
You pulled it off.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.182
- Yeah. [laughs]
- With me.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.216
Yeah.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.553
The temperature dropped
30 degrees last night.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.823
It is freezing,
so, Laura, come back,

11:29.856 --> 11:31.391
and keep hugging me,
please.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.493
Come back for more.
Don't--don't--

11:33.526 --> 11:35.228
No, don't leave me.
[speaking Spanish]

11:35.261 --> 11:36.930
[laughs]

11:36.963 --> 11:38.698
I have a guy,
his name is Andr√©.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.166
He's representing
a Brazilian developer.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.501
- Okay.
- He was actually interested

11:41.534 --> 11:43.303
in looking at just Williamsburg
and Brooklyn Heights...

11:45.972 --> 11:48.108
And apparently,
he wants to come only for this.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.709
I really want Laura to be
in the showings,

11:49.743 --> 11:53.213
because up till now, it feels
like it's me against her.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.815
We're really a team,
and I want her to know

11:55.849 --> 11:56.816
that I feel that way.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.386
- Andr√©.
- Hi, Luis, how are you?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.054
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you, Luis.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.489
Pleasure, pleasure.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.290
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.596
I'm from Venezuela.

12:11.698 --> 12:12.665
Ah.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.702
[both speaking Spanish]

12:18.338 --> 12:19.639
Looking
for an investment property

12:19.673 --> 12:21.074
and been reading
a lot about Cobble Hill,

12:21.074 --> 12:22.942
the neighborhood
and how hot it is,

12:22.976 --> 12:25.078
so she wants to buy it
for investment purposes.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.280
My client read a lot
about this neighborhood.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.418
I think he's gonna respond
extremely well to this project.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.590
(Luis)
The first eight townhouses
were sold very quickly,

12:37.624 --> 12:40.293
and they left this one for last
because this is sort of like

12:40.326 --> 12:41.594
the penthouse
of the development.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.264
We really wanted to build
something that would be timeless

12:44.297 --> 12:46.433
and iconic and really fit in
with the neighborhood.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.102
(Luis)
It's 3,300 square feet.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.538
It has four bedrooms,
five bathrooms.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.540
There'll be a fireplace
right in the corner here,

12:53.573 --> 12:56.009
and then on the other side
of that is the fourth bedroom.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.012
that comes out
from the kitchen.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.046
Can you see this?

13:01.848 --> 13:03.516
Are we a team,
or are we a team?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.619
I mean, this is like, uh,
Bonnie and Clyde.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.222
Thelma and Louise
or Thelma and Luis.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.225
She's Thelma.
[laughs]

13:14.094 --> 13:17.330
Oh, no.
[speaking Spanish]

13:17.364 --> 13:19.532
This entire floor is
your master suite.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.134
This is your master bedroom,
wow.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.337
[speaking Spanish]

13:31.644 --> 13:32.979
[laughter]

13:34.147 --> 13:35.482
Just under $4 million.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.551
Well, there's no negotiator
here,

13:38.585 --> 13:39.586
- especially in front of her.
- I don't know about that.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.820
[laughter]
- No, listen,

13:40.854 --> 13:43.656
everything in this project
has gone for full ask.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.991
She has to move quickly,
I know.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.526
- Yes.
- Thank you for the opportunity.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.560
- Absolutely.
- Really appreciate it.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.561
Absolutely, come,
I'll walk you down.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.863
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.132
Thank you so much.
I'll discuss it with my client.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.700
- Yes.
- Looks great.

13:53.733 --> 14:01.041
* *

14:01.041 --> 14:02.242
- Hey!
- Hi.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.044
- Hey!
- Hi!

14:04.044 --> 14:05.879
- Oh, you're so cute.
- Hi.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.180
Great to see you again.

14:07.213 --> 14:08.415
- Oh, Derek.
- So happy you're here.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.816
(Fredrik)
Before going to Are,

14:09.849 --> 14:12.419
I have to take care of the most
important business of all...

14:13.420 --> 14:14.854
Yes.
Thank you.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.456
Seeing my family.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.158
Welcome to Sweden.
Ah.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.159
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.326
- Cheers.
- Welcome to--

14:20.360 --> 14:22.629
[laughter]

14:22.662 --> 14:23.963
(Malin)
How have you been?

14:24.064 --> 14:25.432
(Fredrik)
We've been good.
I was at the office.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.634
We're leaving to Are soon,
so we're going up north.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.902
- Derek's never been there...
- Ah.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.270
So we're hoping to see
some northern lights.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.871
It's beautiful.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.707
My family is
everything to me.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.910
I mean, I think about them
every single solitary day.

14:36.943 --> 14:41.081
I feel really guilty
for being so far away from them.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
So...

14:43.083 --> 14:46.853
we have something
really exciting to tell you.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.589
We have told you that we've been
planning to have kids,

14:49.622 --> 14:52.092
and then there was
a period where...

14:52.125 --> 14:53.326
- Mm.
- I can say, right,

14:53.360 --> 14:55.662
- that you weren't ready.
- Yeah, sure.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.432
But then all of a sudden,
he turns over to me and says,

14:59.466 --> 15:02.068
"I'm ready now."

15:02.102 --> 15:05.305
I know you're gonna be fantastic
because somewhere inside,

15:05.338 --> 15:06.773
you are a kid still.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.174
You're gonna be
the best father ever.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.376
[laughter]

15:09.409 --> 15:11.177
Your target so far
has been to become

15:11.211 --> 15:13.613
the number one real estate
broker in New York, right?

15:13.646 --> 15:14.881
Check.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.817
Now your next target is
to become the number one father.

15:17.851 --> 15:20.854
I'm perhaps not the person
to say this, because I had

15:20.887 --> 15:24.124
a tremendous workload
when you kids were small,

15:24.157 --> 15:27.060
but if there's anything
I might regret, it's that

15:27.093 --> 15:30.697
I didn't spend more time
with you when you were small.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.732
When you were there,
you were so amazing.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.234
You showed us everything.
You showed us the world.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.336
You made it feel like
anything was possible,

15:36.369 --> 15:39.472
and then you disappeared.

15:41.541 --> 15:45.478
So really think through
how much your workload is,

15:45.512 --> 15:47.414
and if you can sort of
pull that down a bit

15:47.447 --> 15:51.251
so you spend more time
with your child and with Derek.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.689
I'll be happy being number--
number two or three.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.590
- Number two.
- [laughs]

15:57.624 --> 16:01.795
Because I'm gonna be
the number one father, right?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.596
You're gonna be perfect.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.800
That's so funny that I actually
say that, "Number two."

16:06.833 --> 16:09.502
You know, the reason why
I left Sweden to go to New York

16:09.536 --> 16:11.638
is because I wanted to be
the number one broker

16:11.671 --> 16:14.174
in the number one market
in the world,

16:14.207 --> 16:17.610
but now I'm gonna have a child,
little beautiful Milla.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.747
I have to change priorities.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.183
Imagine, next year
you have a little daughter,

16:23.216 --> 16:25.285
and we're going
to Fire Island.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.220
Great Instagram pictures,
a lot of likes.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.055
[laughter]

16:29.055 --> 16:31.291
Where are you now?
Have you found a mother?

16:31.324 --> 16:35.762
At this point, we are struggling
a little bit with the eggs.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.198
(Fredrik)
Before we asked Emilia
for her eggs,

16:38.231 --> 16:40.533
we asked my sister-in-law Malin
for hers.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.270
She said yes,
and for a hot moment there,

16:44.304 --> 16:46.773
we were so excited, until
my brother came into the mix

16:46.806 --> 16:50.744
and just said, "This is crazy,"
and he shut it down.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.380
The one that we're putting--
or I'm at least

16:53.413 --> 16:56.850
putting a lot of my hopes in
are--are--is Anna.

16:56.883 --> 16:57.851
Mm-hmm.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.352
She would be
a fantastic choice,

16:59.386 --> 17:01.554
I mean, with your history
as well.

17:01.588 --> 17:05.025
I asked my best friend Anna
a while back over the phone,

17:05.058 --> 17:07.560
and although it wasn't
a flat-out no,

17:07.594 --> 17:12.365
it was clear to me
that she felt uncomfortable.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.367
But this trip is
a real opportunity

17:14.401 --> 17:17.404
for us to sit down in person
and ask her again.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.473
I've actually invited Anna
to Are.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.275
I don't want to sell it
too much on her

17:22.308 --> 17:23.710
'cause I'm really good
at selling.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.845
You know what I mean,
I want it to come from her,

17:25.879 --> 17:28.381
but it would be so amazing.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.917
You have to tell us
right after you talk to Anna.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.185
- [sighs]
- Oh, we will.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.920
Yeah, it's gonna be
an important trip.

17:38.291 --> 17:46.066
* *

17:47.334 --> 17:48.935
How's the string quartet coming?
Did you get anybody?

17:48.968 --> 17:50.737
Uh, a little difficult.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.971
What are you talking about?
It's New York City.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.573
- Keep looking.
- I will.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.674
Did you at least get
the phone number

17:54.708 --> 17:55.809
for the Times Square Alliance
people?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.444
Yes.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.978
Okay.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.914
Everyone's always asking me
when I'm gonna ask

18:01.014 --> 18:03.550
Emilia to marry me,
including all of my clients

18:03.583 --> 18:05.085
and my developers,
like Yvonne.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.319
[phone line ringing]

18:06.353 --> 18:09.022
I don't know exactly when
I'm gonna do it,

18:09.022 --> 18:10.557
but I do know where.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.560
[phone line ringing]

18:15.028 --> 18:16.830
Um, my name is Ryan,

18:16.863 --> 18:22.302
and I'm thinking about proposing
to my girlfriend,

18:22.335 --> 18:26.039
and I'd like to shut down
Times Square completely

18:26.072 --> 18:29.075
and do it there.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.215
Why--why?

18:39.552 --> 18:42.122
<i>Vanilla Sky,</i>I know, right?
How cool was that?

18:42.155 --> 18:43.156
[woman on phone laughs]

18:44.657 --> 18:47.827
Tom Cruise did it,
so I could do it.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.229
So it is possible?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.402
How costly are we talking?

18:58.304 --> 18:59.906
Okay, I will call
the mayor's office.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.408
Thank you very much.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.643
Thanks.

19:03.677 --> 19:05.745
I just hope that
<i>Vanilla Sky</i>

19:05.779 --> 19:08.348
doesn't turn
into<i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

19:08.381 --> 19:10.383
Do you have de Blasio's
cell phone number?

19:10.417 --> 19:12.118
Yes.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.388
(Ryan)
Coming up...

19:15.422 --> 19:17.557
Call them back
and get them up to ask.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.925
They may walk.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.360
Or they can come up.

19:20.393 --> 19:21.361
I have a feeling
that I can bring them

19:21.394 --> 19:22.562
all the way to full ask.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.499
I hate to back up such good news
with bad news, but--

19:31.071 --> 19:34.040
[cheerful music]

19:34.074 --> 19:39.446
* *

19:39.479 --> 19:41.147
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:41.181 --> 19:43.149
Are is this fabulous
ski resort,

19:43.183 --> 19:45.852
one hour flight north
of Stockholm.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.254
It's like Aspen
of Northern Europe,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.156
one of the top,
top resorts.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.058
Ooh!

19:52.092 --> 19:54.861
Okay, we're here.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.331
Ahh.
Feels so good.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.334
(Fredrik)
Ski in, ski out,
ski in, ski out.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.769
Who needs a driver?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.571
I mean, when was the last time

20:04.604 --> 20:07.007
I could ski
to an appointment?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.009
It's so much fun,
I could do this for free.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.677
Oh, no, I forgot, 3%.

20:10.710 --> 20:14.581
Last time I was in Are,
I was, like, a pimpled teenager,

20:14.614 --> 20:15.815
and here I am,

20:15.849 --> 20:18.551
back with a multinational
real estate company.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.921
It just feels really amazing.

20:21.955 --> 20:25.458
Wow.
It's so beautiful.

20:25.492 --> 20:32.232
* *

20:32.265 --> 20:34.567
This is so different, guys,
than New York.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.670
(Fredrik)
Derek and I flew
into Are last night,

20:36.703 --> 20:40.206
and later tonight, I am
gonna be hosting a big party

20:40.240 --> 20:41.975
for all
the international buyers

20:42.008 --> 20:43.810
that I've flown in
from all over Europe.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.579
I can imagine me living here,
waking up in the morning,

20:46.613 --> 20:50.083
seeing Derek's naked, tan body
walking around.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.686
(Fredrik)
But you know me,
I don't like to wait,

20:52.719 --> 20:55.922
so already now I'm gonna start
doing private showings

20:55.955 --> 20:58.658
to some local Swedes,
you know, the early birds.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.763
Hey, Ylva.
Sophia, hey.

21:03.797 --> 21:05.565
- Isabel, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.733
Will you go down
and greet--

21:06.766 --> 21:07.801
Yeah, I'm gonna
pick up the rest.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.336
You know how it is.
It's like,

21:09.369 --> 21:11.638
when somebody wants something,
it's, like, nonstop showings.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.972
- Hello!
- Hello.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.674
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- [laughs] Hi.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.443
Seven bedrooms, four bathrooms,
that's a lot.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.244
We need it.
I have three kids.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.312
But you look so young.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.580
Let me guess, let me guess,
let me guess.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.082
Just turned 21.

21:22.082 --> 21:24.551
I love you even more now.
[laughs]

21:24.584 --> 21:25.652
- Wow.
- Wow.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.820
This is amazing.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.421
- First thing first.
- First thing--

21:28.455 --> 21:30.757
- The view is everything.
- Oh.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.392
Winter wonderland.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.927
I usually don't
dress up like this

21:33.960 --> 21:35.962
on Fifth Avenue in New York,
but I actually skied here.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.597
Ski in, ski out.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.966
Yeah, "ski in, ski out"
is something we're looking for.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.368
The house is
very intelligent.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.303
Thermostat,
you control everything,

21:43.336 --> 21:45.638
central AC,
heated floors.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.675
Have you ever seen
a longer kitchen aisle?

21:48.708 --> 21:49.809
No, I don't think so.

21:49.843 --> 21:51.745
It's actually
three Fredriks long.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.113
[laughs]

21:54.547 --> 21:56.850
In this wing,
which is very impressive,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.118
you have a total
of four bedrooms.

21:58.118 --> 22:00.320
Two on this side--a little bit
smaller for the kids--

22:00.353 --> 22:01.654
a really nice one here,

22:01.688 --> 22:03.189
and then the master.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.858
This is where the magic
will happen.

22:04.891 --> 22:05.892
- I can see that.
- You like magic?

22:05.925 --> 22:06.893
Yeah, don't you?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.228
I mean, I'm quite the wizard.

22:08.261 --> 22:09.362
[laughs]

22:09.396 --> 22:12.766
Full beautiful bath,
en suite.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.900
- Look at the wood.
- Oh.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.435
You smell it, it's so...
[breathes deeply]

22:15.468 --> 22:17.337
- Yeah.
- Authentic.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.908
11.7 million.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.444
Sounds so cheap, doesn't it?
11.7?

22:24.477 --> 22:26.913
No, not really.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.782
(Fredrik)
It's really no difference
than New York.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.316
I mean, when you're trying
to set a record

22:30.350 --> 22:33.520
and you're going beyond
anyone else that's ever sold,

22:33.553 --> 22:35.922
of course
I'm gonna get resistance.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.090
It's quite expensive.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.425
I'm disagreeing.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.093
It's a hot spot, like,
people from Denmark,

22:40.093 --> 22:43.096
Finland, Iceland, Sweden,
we even have people from London.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.197
That's why I think the price
is gonna go up.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.534
I think 11.7 is actually
a bit on the low side.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.203
This is true status,
to own a house,

22:50.236 --> 22:51.871
the best house
in all of Are.

22:51.905 --> 22:54.341
Beautiful summer, and the winter
with all the snow.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.375
Plus you like to ski.

23:01.081 --> 23:04.050
It's true that there are
a lot of vacation options

23:04.084 --> 23:06.186
for any Swede in Europe,
right?

23:06.219 --> 23:09.055
But this is one of the most
unique and beautiful regions

23:09.055 --> 23:11.791
in the world,
and they're not gonna find this

23:11.825 --> 23:13.693
anywhere but here.

23:13.727 --> 23:16.329
For you to really fall in love
with this place,

23:16.363 --> 23:18.098
it's all about outside.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.066
As an example,
have you ever dogsled?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.568
- No, I haven't, no.
- No.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.069
Isn't it
a little bit dangerous?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.871
- No, dogs. Dogs are everything.
- No?

23:24.904 --> 23:28.208
I think that's where
I need to...get you.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.810
Do some activities with you.
Do you have any time tomorrow?

23:31.878 --> 23:33.413
I want you to feel
that rush.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.216
You're gonna realize that
the price is actually very low.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.352
- Low?
- Low, yeah.

23:39.386 --> 23:41.354
So let me call them,
try to make an arrangement.

23:41.388 --> 23:42.355
I'll text you.

23:42.389 --> 23:43.957
Perfect, yeah.
Yeah.

23:44.958 --> 23:46.226
Yes, I have to work
tomorrow.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.894
Work is good,
'cause then you can afford

23:47.927 --> 23:49.329
the very low 11.7.

23:49.362 --> 23:51.498
Okay, yeah, that's good.
[laughs]

23:51.531 --> 23:52.966
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

23:52.999 --> 24:00.040
* *

24:04.310 --> 24:05.412
Boo!

24:05.445 --> 24:06.613
- [laughs]
- Hi.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.114
Is that necessary?
[laughs]

24:08.148 --> 24:09.783
Yes, of course.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.885
(Ryan)
There's really nothing
that I love more

24:11.918 --> 24:15.155
than meeting a developer and
having good news to tell them.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.491
Really...
hits me right there.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.659
How's everything?
How are the kids?

24:19.693 --> 24:22.095
Good, doing well.
How's Emilia doing?

24:22.128 --> 24:24.097
Good, I think.
I don't see her that much.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.066
- You're working too hard.
- For you.

24:26.099 --> 24:27.734
Yeah, that's why I can't say,
"Stop working so hard."

24:27.767 --> 24:29.069
I know.

24:29.069 --> 24:30.303
So you want to talk
about the building for a second?

24:30.337 --> 24:31.338
Sure.

24:31.371 --> 24:32.372
So...

24:33.773 --> 24:35.742
This one you had,
this is the maisonette,

24:35.775 --> 24:37.644
which is sold
for the full asking.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.978
- Right.
- Oh, oh.

24:39.079 --> 24:41.414
This is residence two,
sold this one for full asking,

24:41.448 --> 24:42.615
for 2.7.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.352
This is residence three
for 4.725.

24:45.385 --> 24:48.521
They really wanted to negotiate,
and I said, "No. I can't.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.558
Yvonne, she'll find me,
she'll take my firstborn,"

24:51.591 --> 24:53.226
and they were like,
"You know what, Ryan,

24:53.259 --> 24:54.427
we're gonna pay full ask."

24:54.461 --> 24:55.628
So that's that one,
and then this one--

24:55.662 --> 24:57.297
I can't wait to see
your firstborn, by the way.

24:59.299 --> 25:02.035
So this one, I drew up
a deal memo,

25:02.035 --> 25:05.138
because I think this is
a great deal, okay?

25:05.171 --> 25:10.577
For residence four,
the offer is 4.5.

25:12.445 --> 25:13.780
- 4...
- It's a good deal.

25:13.813 --> 25:14.881
- From where we are.
- .5?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.550
I think 4.5, honestly,
as your broker,

25:17.584 --> 25:19.486
is a very good offer,

25:19.519 --> 25:21.721
and then you've sold out
the whole building.

25:25.091 --> 25:29.162
Call them back and tell them
we do not accept their offer,

25:29.195 --> 25:30.630
and get them up to ask.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.969
They may walk.

25:36.069 --> 25:37.437
Or they can come up.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.474
I will see what I can do.

25:41.508 --> 25:42.509
Good luck.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.146
[phone line ringing]
- [sighs]

25:46.179 --> 25:48.848
Hey, it's Ryan Serhant.

25:48.882 --> 25:51.084
So I'm actually
with the developer right now,

25:51.117 --> 25:52.786
and here's the problem.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.154
We've been able
to get full asking

25:54.187 --> 25:55.488
for everything else
in the building.

25:55.522 --> 25:57.657
You are the only person
who's come in

25:57.691 --> 25:59.926
with a lowball offer.

26:01.695 --> 26:04.330
I know you said
you don't have any more room,

26:04.364 --> 26:05.765
but I know what that means.

26:05.799 --> 26:09.369
That means you might have
just a little bit more room.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.937
That's it?

26:11.037 --> 26:14.641
[dramatic music]

26:14.674 --> 26:17.444
I will get back to you
as soon as I can.

26:17.477 --> 26:19.779
All right.

26:19.813 --> 26:21.915
[grunts softly]

26:23.149 --> 26:24.317
Got good news?

26:24.351 --> 26:26.686
Um, so I just
spoke to them.

26:26.720 --> 26:27.887
Okay.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.958
And they are not coming
to full ask.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.594
As a show of good faith
to get the deal done,

26:34.627 --> 26:36.763
they'll come up
a good amount.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.331
And by "a good amount,"

26:38.365 --> 26:41.968
I mean $25,000.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.808
You're telling me
coming up $25,000 is good?

26:48.842 --> 26:50.944
I'm thinking
that's a lot of money.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.913
$25,000, that's like part
of an engagement ring.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.517
[dramatic music]

26:57.550 --> 26:59.386
I expected so much more
from you.

26:59.419 --> 27:01.855
Getting nearly $2,200 a foot

27:01.888 --> 27:04.691
for a part-time doorman
on 82nd and East End,

27:04.724 --> 27:06.226
it's like no one else
can do that.

27:06.259 --> 27:07.527
What's wrong with that?

27:07.560 --> 27:10.163
That's what I thought.
That's what I--

27:10.196 --> 27:14.501
* *

27:14.534 --> 27:16.503
You have a deal.
I would have taken 4.5.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.507
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.941
I think it's a great offer.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.643
Are you ready
for your next project?

27:23.677 --> 27:25.211
I don't know.

27:25.245 --> 27:27.080
I don't know.
I don't know if I have the--

27:27.113 --> 27:28.548
Yes, I'm ready
for the next project!

27:28.581 --> 27:29.783
Let's do it!

27:29.816 --> 27:33.720
I think Yvonne
is my favorite developer ever.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.055
Cheers.

27:35.055 --> 27:36.456
Maybe we can
celebrate next time

27:36.489 --> 27:38.158
over something
a little different.

27:38.191 --> 27:40.193
(Ryan)
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:40.226 --> 27:43.697
[rock music]

27:43.730 --> 27:46.533
* *

27:46.566 --> 27:47.801
Ronita,
can you do me a favor

27:47.834 --> 27:49.536
and make sure that
the Venezuelan couple

27:49.569 --> 27:51.705
are confirmed for tonight?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.807
Call me if anything changes.
Bye-bye.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.811
Gerard and I have been trying
to get together

27:57.844 --> 27:59.245
for the past
couple of days,

27:59.279 --> 28:01.381
but we have been unable because
our schedules are very busy.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.116
Gerard, good morning,
good morning.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.451
Oh, look at this.
The way we start.

28:04.484 --> 28:05.719
How are you?
Good to see you.

28:05.752 --> 28:06.920
Pleasure, pleasure.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.755
But the timing
couldn't be more perfect,

28:08.788 --> 28:12.792
because today I have something
incredible to tell him.

28:12.826 --> 28:14.227
So how is everything,
my friend?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.395
- Um, good.
- Yeah?

28:15.428 --> 28:17.497
I got some news.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.499
We have an offer.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.035
It's from one of the showings
that I did with Laura.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.104
It's coming
from a Venezuelan couple.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.673
The husband
is coming in tonight.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.675
3.75.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.913
Okay, so 3.75?

28:33.947 --> 28:35.281
Yes, which is
an initial offer,

28:35.315 --> 28:36.483
but I have
a very good feeling

28:36.516 --> 28:39.486
that I can bring them
all the way to full ask.

28:39.519 --> 28:41.087
It's an amazing feeling.

28:41.121 --> 28:43.656
I harassed Gerard.
I found him.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.191
I promised him something.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.360
He gave me the opportunity.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.661
And now I'm delivering.

28:48.695 --> 28:52.065
Okay, well,
it's a very good offer.

28:52.098 --> 28:56.302
And I hate to back up
such good news with bad news.

28:56.336 --> 28:57.804
But as you know,

28:57.837 --> 29:01.274
our team has been
running tandem with you.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.809
Yes.

29:02.842 --> 29:06.513
We did take
a full-price offer.

29:06.546 --> 29:09.816
And we're gonna execute
that contract.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.651
Seriously?

29:16.489 --> 29:18.224
We just have a rule
amongst ourselves.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.359
When we accept the deal,

29:19.392 --> 29:21.227
even though
it's not executed,

29:21.261 --> 29:22.395
we stay by that deal.

29:22.429 --> 29:25.398
They came in at full price
with the best terms,

29:25.432 --> 29:27.600
and we're gonna honor that,
so...

29:27.634 --> 29:30.837
But you will get paid.
That's the good side.

29:32.739 --> 29:36.710
I can see the disappointment
on your face.

29:36.743 --> 29:39.045
I mean, I can't--
I can't--

29:39.045 --> 29:40.347
I can't be happy.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.282
There's a part of me
that wanted that deal

29:42.315 --> 29:43.817
to be from me.

29:43.850 --> 29:47.554
Your efforts certainly didn't
go unnoticed, you know?

29:47.587 --> 29:50.790
What I really--what I really,
honestly care about

29:50.824 --> 29:52.058
and the reason
I came to you

29:52.058 --> 29:53.360
and asked you
for this opportunity,

29:53.393 --> 29:55.395
it's not just to sell
a townhouse on a project.

29:55.428 --> 29:58.798
It's to really build
a relationship with you.

29:58.832 --> 30:00.166
You know that.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.869
Look, you did something
that no one has been able to do.

30:02.902 --> 30:07.240
You were able to get me
to even consider another broker

30:07.273 --> 30:08.742
here in this market.

30:08.775 --> 30:10.744
Your efforts
were outstanding.

30:10.777 --> 30:12.112
The event was very good.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.813
From what I understand
from Laura,

30:13.847 --> 30:15.815
you were doing
an excellent job out there.

30:15.849 --> 30:18.318
I'm not gonna promise you
that any of the other jobs

30:18.351 --> 30:19.686
I'm gonna just give you.

30:19.719 --> 30:22.622
I will promise you that
I can give you consideration

30:22.655 --> 30:24.224
on those other jobs.

30:24.257 --> 30:28.495
We'll work something out
that will make everyone happy.

30:28.528 --> 30:30.163
Don't look so down, man.
Things are good.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.198
We sold the piece of property.
You're gonna get paid.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.500
You were part of a team
that was victorious.

30:33.533 --> 30:35.635
I am--Exactly.

30:35.669 --> 30:36.970
We did what we wanted to do.
We achieved--

30:37.003 --> 30:38.905
I may have passed the ball
as opposed to shoot it.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.507
You're right.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.876
This was not a slam dunk,

30:42.909 --> 30:47.080
but I think overall...

30:47.113 --> 30:48.415
it was a win.

30:48.448 --> 30:51.851
I think working together
has proved to him

30:51.885 --> 30:53.386
that I'm able to work
with his team,

30:53.420 --> 30:55.288
that I have vision,
and that I can deliver.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.590
And most importantly,
I created a foundation

30:57.624 --> 30:59.325
between the both of us
for the future.

30:59.359 --> 31:01.461
That is amazing.

31:01.494 --> 31:03.463
Well, listen,
congratulations to us.

31:03.496 --> 31:04.864
Yes, absolutely.

31:04.898 --> 31:05.865
Okay, do you need
an instructions

31:05.899 --> 31:06.866
how to get back
to Manhattan?

31:06.900 --> 31:07.867
I know my way back.

31:07.901 --> 31:09.402
All right,
my friend, be well.

31:09.436 --> 31:10.403
Bye, Gerard.

31:10.437 --> 31:11.671
Have a good day.
Bye-bye.

31:11.705 --> 31:12.906
(Ryan)
Coming up...

31:12.939 --> 31:14.641
Oh, God, I'm scared.
What are you doing?

31:14.674 --> 31:15.975
[dramatic music]

31:16.076 --> 31:17.777
What is going on?

31:22.349 --> 31:24.084
I remember the day
after Christmas day

31:24.084 --> 31:26.152
when we were kids,

31:26.186 --> 31:27.921
Fredrik would start
selling his toys

31:27.954 --> 31:29.122
to the neighborhood kids,

31:29.155 --> 31:31.191
because he got tired
already of the toys.

31:31.224 --> 31:32.459
[laughter]

31:32.492 --> 31:34.127
You should be prepared
to have a very restless

31:34.160 --> 31:36.096
and energetic kid.

31:36.096 --> 31:38.098
It's gonna be interesting
to see if it's gonna be

31:38.131 --> 31:39.532
a mini Fredrik.

31:39.566 --> 31:42.702
There's a risk of it being
a restless little bastard.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.637
I was probably
the easiest child

31:44.671 --> 31:46.806
in the history
of mankind, right?

31:46.840 --> 31:49.576
Well, I wouldn't
quite agree.

31:49.609 --> 31:50.744
[laughter]

31:50.777 --> 31:52.779
(Fredrik)
I'm not getting any support.

31:56.149 --> 32:00.253
* *

32:01.488 --> 32:02.455
Yes.

32:02.489 --> 32:04.057
- Am I saying it right?
- Perfect, yeah.

32:04.057 --> 32:05.492
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you as well.

32:05.525 --> 32:06.593
- Come on back.
- Thank you.

32:06.626 --> 32:07.694
- Luis.
- Yes?

32:07.727 --> 32:08.962
Meet Reycellis.
Reycellis, Luis.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.597
- Reycellis, how are you?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

32:10.630 --> 32:11.865
- Pleasure, please.
- I'm just gonna grab a chair.

32:11.898 --> 32:13.266
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.901
Recently I've been
talking a lot to Ronita

32:14.934 --> 32:16.369
about building a team.

32:16.403 --> 32:17.971
I think we're having
a problem.

32:18.071 --> 32:19.773
We have
all of these clients,

32:19.806 --> 32:21.708
and we're not paying
enough attention to each one.

32:23.510 --> 32:26.980
There's a problem
with the offer.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.715
Yes.

32:28.748 --> 32:30.550
I think we just need
additional support.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.085
We need some help.

32:32.085 --> 32:33.887
It's been very hard
to find the time,

32:33.920 --> 32:35.689
which is of course
the problem.

32:35.722 --> 32:37.323
- Luis, this is Omar.
- Hello. How are you?

32:37.357 --> 32:38.658
Luis Ortiz.
Nice to meet you.

32:38.692 --> 32:39.993
All right,
very sharp suit.

32:40.093 --> 32:41.161
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

32:41.194 --> 32:43.163
But after what happened
with the Joneses

32:43.196 --> 32:44.597
and what happened
with Gerard,

32:44.631 --> 32:46.633
I decided
I could not wait any more.

32:46.666 --> 32:47.967
Very impressive r√©sum√©.

32:48.001 --> 32:49.769
Tell me what's so amazing
about you.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.504
I've got the Rolodex,
I've got the motivation,

32:51.538 --> 32:52.939
and I've got the respect.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.307
For seven years,
I worked for

32:54.341 --> 32:56.009
the Central Bank
of the Dominican Republic.

32:56.109 --> 32:58.845
I just finished
my freshman year at Harvard.

32:58.878 --> 33:00.580
What value
do you bring to me?

33:00.613 --> 33:02.382
I feel like
I'm a people person.

33:02.415 --> 33:03.650
People like me
right away.

33:03.683 --> 33:05.085
Whenever I interview someone,

33:05.118 --> 33:08.555
I always try to find
who I was back then.

33:08.588 --> 33:10.423
I'm motivated, and there's
nobody in this business

33:10.457 --> 33:11.458
who's as hungry as I am.

33:14.928 --> 33:16.196
For the long term,
I'm really interested

33:16.229 --> 33:17.564
in real estate development.

33:17.597 --> 33:19.566
I'm a goer, I'm a doer,
I'm a chaser.

33:19.599 --> 33:21.901
Luis isn't really
always around.

33:21.935 --> 33:24.971
So is that something, like,
you're gonna be okay with?

33:25.071 --> 33:26.272
Ronita runs my life.

33:26.306 --> 33:28.608
She does my calendar.
She does my appointments.

33:28.641 --> 33:30.110
She makes sure I am on time.

33:30.143 --> 33:32.579
Without her,
right now I'm nobody.

33:32.612 --> 33:35.115
I need to find brokers
that I can trust,

33:35.148 --> 33:36.282
that I can rely on

33:36.316 --> 33:39.219
just as much as I rely
and trust Ronita.

33:39.252 --> 33:40.387
Thank you very much
for coming.

33:40.420 --> 33:41.921
You will hear from us.

33:41.955 --> 33:44.657
I don't wanna be
just a broker all my life.

33:44.691 --> 33:45.925
- I'll walk you out.
- See you.

33:45.959 --> 33:48.895
I want to be able to lead
and build an army

33:48.928 --> 33:50.764
of incredibly talented,
successful,

33:50.797 --> 33:52.198
highly educated brokers.

33:52.232 --> 33:54.334
Pleasure.
And congrats on Harvard.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.403
This is the first step
towards that direction.

33:56.436 --> 33:57.470
Thank you.

33:57.504 --> 33:58.905
Show him out,
and very nice suit.

33:58.938 --> 34:00.173
(Ronita)
What do you think?

34:00.206 --> 34:01.474
(Luis)
I don't know, Ronita.

34:01.508 --> 34:02.776
Can we just clone you?

34:02.809 --> 34:04.678
[Ronita chuckles]
You wish.

34:04.711 --> 34:12.552
* *

34:12.585 --> 34:13.586
Wow.

34:13.620 --> 34:17.290
I need to test taste
everything...

34:17.323 --> 34:20.060
You can say that selling
a house is a lot like dating.

34:20.093 --> 34:23.263
Food and good wine
always helps.

34:23.296 --> 34:25.265
I love the flat Swedish bread.

34:25.298 --> 34:26.833
Derek and I
are staying at a lodge

34:26.866 --> 34:28.702
at the Copperhill Ski Resort,

34:28.735 --> 34:30.804
and it also happens
to be a perfect place

34:30.837 --> 34:33.973
to throw a party
for my international buyers.

34:34.074 --> 34:36.876
Wealthy buyers,
I may add.

34:36.910 --> 34:38.445
Hi!

34:38.478 --> 34:40.080
Mwah.
Where are you from?

34:40.080 --> 34:41.748
Mwah.
Copenhagen?

34:41.781 --> 34:43.416
Gothenburg?

34:44.417 --> 34:46.086
Helsinki?

34:46.086 --> 34:47.487
Hi.
How's it going?

34:47.520 --> 34:48.788
Welcome to Are.

34:48.822 --> 34:50.523
We have champagne.
We have some food.

34:50.557 --> 34:51.791
[indistinct chatter]

34:51.825 --> 34:54.260
[tapping glass]

34:54.294 --> 34:57.097
Welcome to Copperhill

34:57.097 --> 35:00.834
and the last villa we have left
at Sunset Peak.

35:00.867 --> 35:02.435
* *

35:02.469 --> 35:04.304
11.7 million.

35:04.337 --> 35:05.772
3,000 square feet.

35:05.805 --> 35:07.674
Seven bedroom,
four baths.

35:07.707 --> 35:09.209
You have a view
of the lake

35:09.242 --> 35:10.477
and the mountain.

35:10.510 --> 35:12.679
The finishes
are really gorgeous.

35:12.712 --> 35:13.747
And it's gonna sell.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.215
Cheers!
[speaking Swedish]

35:18.251 --> 35:19.252
Ah.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.388
Put your hand out.
Do you feel it?

35:21.421 --> 35:23.556
The whole atmosphere,
it's, like, vibrating in here,

35:23.590 --> 35:25.925
because someone is gonna
buy the house tonight.

35:25.959 --> 35:29.129
The question is,
is it gonna be you, Sophia?

35:29.162 --> 35:30.797
People really want
to get into the market

35:30.830 --> 35:32.432
and buy and own something
in Are.

35:32.465 --> 35:36.069
Yeah, and we have the world
championships coming up in 2019.

35:36.069 --> 35:37.337
So it could be an amazing
investment, you're saying,

35:37.370 --> 35:38.338
to buy now.

35:38.371 --> 35:39.939
Yeah, buy now.
Don't wait.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.708
Are you a real estate broker?
'Cause I could hire you.

35:41.741 --> 35:44.077
"Buy now, don't wait."
I like that.

35:44.110 --> 35:45.979
Look what I'm holding
in my hand.

35:46.079 --> 35:47.714
Guess what it is.

35:49.549 --> 35:50.750
Mmm.

35:50.784 --> 35:52.752
Right now I think
Helene is the front-runner.

35:52.786 --> 35:54.554
I mean, that's why
we're going dogsledding,

35:54.587 --> 35:57.691
'cause I just have a feeling
she's gonna be the one.

35:57.724 --> 35:58.858
I already decided
you're gonna buy it.

35:58.892 --> 36:00.360
I'm always right in the end.

36:02.195 --> 36:03.663
Thank you.

36:03.697 --> 36:05.131
What do you think
about this place?

36:05.165 --> 36:06.599
I rented it 'cause I wanted
to make a good impression

36:06.633 --> 36:07.701
on people like you.

36:07.734 --> 36:09.035
[laughs]
It's beautiful.

36:09.035 --> 36:10.737
It's, uh--
It's lovely.

36:10.770 --> 36:13.073
It has 17 bedrooms,
but we got it for ourselves.

36:13.106 --> 36:14.341
That's great.

36:14.374 --> 36:17.143
All these empty rooms
to fill one day, right?

36:17.177 --> 36:19.713
Wait, are you saying
you want 17 kids?

36:19.746 --> 36:21.414
On that note, babe,

36:21.448 --> 36:23.483
um, Anna's coming soon.

36:23.516 --> 36:25.518
She texted me.
She's almost here.

36:25.552 --> 36:27.253
I'm really anxious.

36:27.287 --> 36:29.155
Of course I want
to sell this house,

36:29.189 --> 36:31.491
but I'm actually
even more nervous

36:31.524 --> 36:33.259
about seeing Anna.

36:33.293 --> 36:36.296
[speaking Swedish]

36:49.576 --> 36:51.578
[gasps]
Wow.

36:53.079 --> 36:56.449
[both squeal]

36:56.483 --> 36:58.251
[speaking Swedish]

37:00.420 --> 37:01.388
Nice to see you.

37:01.421 --> 37:03.123
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Fredrik.

37:03.156 --> 37:06.559
[speaking Swedish]

37:06.593 --> 37:07.794
Boyfriend?

37:07.827 --> 37:08.828
Yeah.

37:08.862 --> 37:11.831
[dramatic music]

37:11.865 --> 37:15.201
* *

37:17.037 --> 37:19.172
When did you--okay.

37:19.205 --> 37:20.507
Just the last
couple of weeks.

37:20.540 --> 37:23.376
- It just happened.
- Brand-new.

37:28.214 --> 37:36.222
* *

37:51.971 --> 37:53.606
(Ryan)
Emilia thinks
that we woke up early

37:53.640 --> 37:55.442
to drive to Boston

37:55.475 --> 37:58.345
to my little brother's
surprise birthday party

37:58.378 --> 38:00.480
that she helped plan.

38:00.513 --> 38:01.781
Here's what you're gonna do.

38:01.815 --> 38:04.351
You're gonna give her
a to-do list, okay?

38:04.384 --> 38:06.820
She loves this stuff.

38:06.853 --> 38:09.556
But we are not going
to Boston.

38:11.091 --> 38:13.026
(man on phone)
Good afternoon.
Mayor de Blasio's office.

38:13.026 --> 38:16.463
I'm thinking about proposing
to my girlfriend,

38:16.496 --> 38:20.200
and I'd like to shut down
Times Square completely.

38:20.233 --> 38:21.434
I called
the Times Square Alliance,

38:21.468 --> 38:23.036
who told me to call
the mayor's office,

38:23.069 --> 38:24.904
who told me to call
the Department of City Planning,

38:24.938 --> 38:26.239
who told me to call
the Department of Buildings,

38:26.272 --> 38:27.741
who told me to call
the NYPD,

38:27.774 --> 38:29.042
and so I did all that.

38:29.042 --> 38:30.944
Bam.
I did it.

38:31.044 --> 38:33.947
[dramatic music]

38:34.047 --> 38:40.720
* *

38:40.754 --> 38:43.790
(Emilia)
What is going on?

38:43.823 --> 38:45.658
What is going on?

38:51.097 --> 38:54.067
[dramatic music]

38:54.100 --> 38:59.839
* *

38:59.873 --> 39:01.374
(Emilia)
What is going on?

39:01.408 --> 39:02.709
What is going on?

39:02.742 --> 39:04.911
Nothing's going on.
Everything's okay.

39:13.820 --> 39:15.822
Oh, God, I'm scared.
What are you doing?

39:15.855 --> 39:17.090
[chuckles]

39:18.291 --> 39:20.794
What are you doing?

39:20.827 --> 39:23.697
Because this moment
is for Emilia,

39:23.730 --> 39:25.532
I want it to be something
that is so special

39:25.565 --> 39:28.935
that she'll be able to tell
our grandkids about it,

39:29.035 --> 39:31.705
you know, with that same
kind of glimmer in her eye.

39:31.738 --> 39:34.140
[Emilia crying]

39:34.174 --> 39:36.543
Don't cry.
Why are you crying?

39:36.576 --> 39:38.244
I don't know,
'cause you're freaking me out.

39:38.278 --> 39:39.913
I don't mean
to freak you out.

39:39.946 --> 39:42.682
I feel very much that
that's what this moment is.

39:42.716 --> 39:45.151
It's the birth
of a whole new life,

39:45.185 --> 39:47.487
which is just
totally crazy.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.222
[sobbing]

39:49.255 --> 39:50.557
Oh, careful.

39:50.590 --> 39:52.859
Don't fall over.

39:54.961 --> 39:56.196
Oh, God.

39:56.229 --> 39:58.665
[classical music]

39:58.698 --> 40:05.505
* *

40:05.538 --> 40:07.774
[laughs]

40:14.347 --> 40:16.649
So crazy, I didn't know you
could shut down Times Square.

40:16.683 --> 40:17.784
No one does that.

40:17.817 --> 40:21.554
* *

40:21.588 --> 40:23.323
Do I look like
a crazy person?

40:23.356 --> 40:25.458
No, you don't look
like a crazy person.

40:27.427 --> 40:30.230
[laughs]

40:30.263 --> 40:33.199
Oh, no,
what does that say?

40:33.233 --> 40:35.268
[laughs]

40:35.301 --> 40:36.403
Don't fall over.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.942
You okay?
You okay?

40:42.976 --> 40:44.110
[sobbing]
Oh.

40:44.144 --> 40:47.681
You remember when we were
talking last night?

40:47.714 --> 40:49.582
We were talking
about how--

40:49.616 --> 40:50.884
how I knew that
I was gonna spend

40:50.917 --> 40:52.052
the rest of my life
with you

40:52.085 --> 40:54.020
and how I knew that,
you know, you're the one,

40:54.054 --> 40:56.189
and that when I found
that person I would just know.

40:58.024 --> 41:00.260
Because I wake up
every single morning for you,

41:00.293 --> 41:02.328
and I go to bed
every single night for you.

41:05.198 --> 41:07.200
And I don't want to go
to sleep another night

41:07.233 --> 41:09.102
not knowing
you're not gonna be my wife.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.371
* *

41:11.404 --> 41:12.372
[laughs]

41:12.405 --> 41:14.074
Oh, my God.

41:19.346 --> 41:21.781
Emilia...

41:21.815 --> 41:24.250
* *

41:24.284 --> 41:27.220
Will you marry me?

41:27.253 --> 41:29.756
[sobs]

41:29.789 --> 41:31.591
Don't fall over.
You're so small.

41:31.624 --> 41:37.163
* *

41:37.197 --> 41:38.365
[whispers]
You have to say yes.

41:38.398 --> 41:39.532
Yes.

41:39.566 --> 41:40.533
[chuckles]

41:40.567 --> 41:48.575
* *

41:59.285 --> 42:00.453
We're not going to Boston.

42:00.487 --> 42:01.955
We're not?

42:02.055 --> 42:03.490
No.

42:03.523 --> 42:05.925
Oh, my God.

42:05.959 --> 42:07.460
[laughing]
Oh, my God!

42:07.494 --> 42:10.964
Words can't even describe
what I'm feeling right now.

42:11.064 --> 42:14.067
I mean, this amazing,
incredible woman

42:14.100 --> 42:16.703
has just agreed
to be my wife.

42:16.736 --> 42:18.071
You wanna, like,
walk around Times Square now?

42:18.071 --> 42:19.339
'Cause we're by ourselves.

42:19.372 --> 42:21.408
There's no one else here.
We could dance.

42:21.441 --> 42:23.076
I just hope
that I can make her

42:23.076 --> 42:25.245
as happy for the rest
of her life

42:25.278 --> 42:28.081
as she's made me
right now.

42:31.384 --> 42:34.254

42:34.287 --> 42:36.589
Am I gonna be dealing with you
or one of your assistants?

42:36.623 --> 42:38.625
I have no girlfriend.
I have no friends.

42:38.658 --> 42:40.593
I dedicate my entire life
to my job.

42:40.627 --> 42:42.262
Wow, that's so sad.

42:42.295 --> 42:44.097
I need it to be at 6.35.

42:44.097 --> 42:45.098
That's it.
Not a penny more.

42:45.131 --> 42:46.633
And whatever she says goes.

42:46.666 --> 42:48.301
If I get a buyer
for penthouse one,

42:48.335 --> 42:50.203
you will be my assistant
for an entire day.

42:50.236 --> 42:51.237
What the--

42:51.271 --> 42:52.505
When you walked in,
the first thing

42:52.539 --> 42:53.807
that crossed my mind was,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.910
I'm not gonna be able
to ask her again for her eggs.

42:56.943 --> 43:00.113
At this point, the deal
is not gonna go through.
