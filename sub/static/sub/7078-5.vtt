WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:05.005
This is from all of us, Troy.
When you're sailing around the world...

00:05.297 --> 00:07.424
you'll be going through
a lot of countries.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.676
So we got you a universal translator.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.347
Cool.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.307
Cool.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.599
Thanks, guys.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.186
I didn't know going-away parties
could be so much fun.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.856
- I should leave all the time.
- Let's not forget it's okay to be sad too.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.359
Britta, do you get kickbacks
from Big Buzz Kill?

00:25.651 --> 00:26.818
- I'm serious.
- We know.

00:27.110 --> 00:30.030
The truth is a member of our family
is leaving.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.532
For a year, maybe more.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.660
Psychology has taught me
the human mind has a tendency...

00:34.952 --> 00:36.787
to rechannel separation anxiety...

00:37.079 --> 00:40.249
in the form of frivolity
and giddiness, and...

00:40.541 --> 00:43.710
I don't want us to waste our chance
to acknowledge...

00:44.002 --> 00:45.921
how much we're gonna miss you.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.716
- Attention, Greendale.
- Oh, announcements.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.885
- Announcements.
- Oh, I love these.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.638
- Announcements.
- I'm standing here with Abed Nadir...

00:54.930 --> 00:58.058
who has chosen
to give his best friend, Troy...

00:58.350 --> 01:00.811
the very special
going-away present...

01:01.103 --> 01:05.857
of declaring a school-wide game
of Hot Lava.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.818
- Cool.
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.612
- No. Process your feelings.
- Hot Lava is the sweet...

01:10.904 --> 01:12.114
classic children's game...

01:12.406 --> 01:17.077
in which you are not allowed
to touch the floor or you're dead.

01:17.369 --> 01:22.207
I think it's cute. And while I normally
don't condone climbing on furniture...

01:22.499 --> 01:25.210
Troy and Abed's friendship
has been such a special...

01:25.502 --> 01:28.422
and magical part of Greendale,
we owe it to ourselves...

01:28.714 --> 01:30.007
to honour it.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.550
Abed, anything to add?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.970
Yes, take this seriously.
Stay on furniture. No books, no bags.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.431
Dead can't talk.
No coming back as a lava monster.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.601
- Yes. Hot Lava.
- Come on, guys...

01:40.892 --> 01:43.312
this is classic avoidance.
I have to go talk to him.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.732
Because the non-awesome often need
incentive to do awesome stuff...

01:47.024 --> 01:50.193
the survivor will win my near-mint
condition issue of Space Clone...

01:50.485 --> 01:53.947
valued by the Comics Authority
at $50,000.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.240
Wh...? I'm sorry?

01:55.532 --> 01:57.159
The floor turns to lava in 10...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.953
nine, eight, seven...

02:00.245 --> 02:01.830
Did you say 15 or 50,000?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.482
- Six...
- Oh, who am I kidding?

02:03.749 --> 02:04.749
Help, lava.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.130
Five, four, three, two...

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.436 --> 02:26.021
Professor Duncan?

02:26.313 --> 02:27.356
You stay back, Britta.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.317
I'm not afraid to push a girl
into make-believe lava.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.278
- It's been my primary strategy.
- I'm staying in the game...

02:33.570 --> 02:35.238
so I can talk to Abed. I'm worried.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.865
What I'm worried about is money.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.743
My self-published novels
aren't going to publish themselves.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.663
Don't regress to primal behaviour
just because it's allowed.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.248
We're human beings,
not the editors of Teen Vogue.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.210
A terrible example
for today's young women.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.380
Well, I'm sorry, Britta,
but it's either you or me.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.173
And I'm me.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.008
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.014
Real nice, Winger.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.685
This is why the English
never win any sports.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.979
Because everyone else cheats.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.190
Britta, there you are.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.068
Sweet, sweet, portable chairs.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.361
Plastic gold.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.154
Four-legged diamonds.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.447
You claiming this?

03:17.739 --> 03:18.865
Lava joust?

03:19.491 --> 03:21.368
You hit your heads
on each other's heads?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.787
Get real.
Once the last of the chairs are gone...

03:24.079 --> 03:26.164
a sofa hopper like you
won't last 20 minutes.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.875
You wanna join this alliance
or you wanna join the lava?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.045
Fine. But I'm not learning
the new names for anything.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.716
Centipeding isn't the fastest form
of travel...

03:36.007 --> 03:38.593
but if we find more chairs,
we can do the Inchworm...

03:38.885 --> 03:39.970
Scootenanny...

03:40.262 --> 03:41.262
Reverse Danny Thomas.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.515
Think this game's gotten
a little out of hand?

03:43.807 --> 03:46.893
Feels normal enough for a school
that's on 911's blocked caller list.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.062
I like that Abed wanted
to send Troy off.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.064
Send him off or put off sending him?

03:51.356 --> 03:54.860
I think this imaginary lava
might symbolise Abed's fear of change.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.571
That diagnosis symbolizes
your lack of a psych degree.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.156
Mama mahogany.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.243
- Feast your feet on that stack of sticks.
- Too easy. Could be a trap.

04:03.535 --> 04:06.204
As if someone else is taking this game
as seriously as you.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.999
Let's keep this centipede rolling.
Give me a chair.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.417
So stupid.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.085
Come on.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.923
- Locker, locker, locker.
- Locker Boys.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.302
- Locker.
- Locker, locker, locker.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.263
Winger, Edison and Perry.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.307
What a delicious combination.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.058
Locker, locker, locker.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.771
What are we getting from this
extra level of commitment?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.564
We're getting your chairs, food...

04:32.856 --> 04:35.108
and the names
of your same-sex celebrity crushes.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.029
Everyone has one, don't lie.
Then you're free to go, into lava.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.781
Locker, locker, locker.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.124
Stand down or meet your doom,
Chang.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.045
You're in no position to make threats.
Our truce ended when you banished us...

04:55.337 --> 04:58.298
- from the pay phone bench.
- You used that to upset the balance.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.218
By the vapours of Magmarath,
we will restore it.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.970
- You have gods?
- Locker boys.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.640
- Earn your M&M's.
- Locker.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.643
Troy and Abed intimidation stance.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.983
I guess that actually looked
the way it did in my head.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.286
Hi, kids.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.665
I'm criminology professor
Buzz Hickey...

05:31.957 --> 05:35.293
and this, this is just a little
something I threw together.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.428
Jump.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.018
- Centipede, centipede.
- Okay.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.481
Pull harder. Pull harder.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.233
Pull harder.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.861
My same-sex celebrity crush
is Nathan Fillion.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.697
Nathan Fillion.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.033
Jeff, Annie. Get to Shirley Island.
We'll meet you there.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.785
Abed, save yourself.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.205
Abed, before Troy dies in lava...

06:12.497 --> 06:14.541
you can save yourself emotionally...

06:14.833 --> 06:19.045
by honestly experiencing the pain
of him leaving Greendale.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.173
We can do this in three steps.
Britta, jump to that trash can.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.633
Troy, start inchworming.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.177
- Third step?
- Third step's survival. Good luck.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.471
Seriously? Troy.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.223
Sorry, Britta, Abed knows best.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.393
I'll remember you as slowing us down
and complaining a lot.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.728
Oh, my... No!

06:42.485 --> 06:43.695
They abandoned you?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.323
This game's doing bad things
to people.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.200
I'm just in it for the money.
My son's getting gay married.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.870
The flowers alone, you have no idea.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.122
I get it.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.916
I lived in New York.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.754
All right, Miss Perry, climb aboard.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.047
It's fake killing time.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.606
Welcome to Shirley Island.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.275
No furniture beyond this point.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.236
Leave weapons at the door
and spare doors at the entrance.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.784
Then came the now-now times...

07:31.076 --> 07:35.747
when the floors were covered
with the burny touch.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.127
- You made it.
- Friends.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.339
Welcome to Shirley Island,
where all your dreams come true...

07:44.631 --> 07:48.259
if you dream of standing on a table
and pissing in a jar. Where's Britta?

07:48.551 --> 07:51.304
- She didn't make it.
- Oh, that's too bad.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.140
- Poor Britta.
- It's okay.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.768
Her sacrifice got us this far,
and now we can't lose.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.060
Why not?

07:58.269 --> 08:02.232
Because now we're on Shirley Island,
and according to legend, so is The Orb.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.402
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're speaking of.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.154
- This is a place of peace.
- And profit.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.323
- Come again?
- You're not really playing.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.534
You're a merchant,
and more power to you.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.286
But don't withhold power
from others just to make money.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.498
- We want The Orb.
- Abed.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.919
I'm still raw from what happened
with Britta back there.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.672
I mean, fun is fun,
but I don't want my last day here...

08:25.964 --> 08:28.174
to be a day
where everyone hates me.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.176
Last day?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.846
Citizens of Shirley Island.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.724
What have you brought to my door?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.642
Stay back.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.354
My God, it's Hickey.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.398
And he's got Chair Walkers.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
Come out with your feet on the floor...

08:49.904 --> 08:54.200
and there will be no need
for nudging or jostling.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.037
I did not skip my son's birthday
for second place.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.546
I wanna say something to you guys
about mental health.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.298
Is that Britta? Is she alive?

09:08.590 --> 09:11.468
- Why did you think she was dead?
- We kind of left her.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.553
Left her for dead?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.889
Sounds bad when you put it that way.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.434
You do realise this isn't just
a pile of chairs, right?

09:19.726 --> 09:23.813
This is a crib, and you're curled up
inside there, sucking your thumb...

09:24.105 --> 09:26.149
because you're too scared
to say goodbye.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.359
Well, it's time to grow up.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.404
The adults are here,
and we're gonna tear down your fort.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.407
Chair Walkers, attack.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.381
My name was Vicki. Tell my story.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.884
These are my only pants.
I can't get them dirty.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.385
I'm actually British.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.596
- Leonard. Butter them up.
- You got it.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.112
Cirque du So Long,
you high-stepping acro-bastards.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.405
- Have any rolling chairs?
- Behind the curtain.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.697
Abandon fort.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.201
Women and man-children first.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.411
Hey, seat feet.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.789
Chair to dance?

10:31.339 --> 10:32.757
Yes.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.970
Britta, I'm your friend.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.847
I can't hear dead people, Annie.

10:39.139 --> 10:43.476
- I'm in a world of imagination.
- Then imagine what the floor looks like.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.813
I don't have to. I'll just
imagine where you're about to be.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.567
- The same as imagining the floor.
- You just admitted that's where you'll be.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.902
- Knock, knock.
- Not gonna say, "Who's there?"

10:53.194 --> 10:56.156
- Someone on the floor is knocking.
- You have to say, "Who's there?"

10:56.447 --> 10:57.615
- Floor.
- What?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.243
- That's who's there.
- Yeah. But it's for you.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.168
Give us The Orb.
We can save Shirley Island.

11:08.459 --> 11:12.338
The Orb can't save Shirley Island
because Shirley Island is The Orb.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.259
In a cool way like Keyser Soze
or a lame way like Jewel of the Nile?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.014
You tell Buzz Hickey
that Shirley Bennett said...

11:21.681 --> 11:24.517
Don't wanna waste time. Think of
something cool, give me credit.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.686
But the door I'm knocking on
is your home...

11:26.978 --> 11:31.024
- if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.
- If you're the floor, you're already dead.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.151
Just do it right. Knock, knock.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.485
Knock, knock.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.702
Who's there, bitch?

11:42.994 --> 11:43.994
Floor.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.497
Floor!

11:53.421 --> 11:56.382
- Troy and Abed in a bubble.
- Troy and Abed in a bubble.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.576
Hickey, you chicken.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.000
He gutted us. Retreat.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.589
Hello?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.716
Hello?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.426
I'm the only one left.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.097
I won 50,000 bucks.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.558
That's 50,000 lottery tickets.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.276
You can't outrun your emotions.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.786
I had a dream like this,
but it was sexual.

13:07.078 --> 13:10.790
I will force you two
to grieve properly even if it kills us all.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.709
Go away, Britta.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.307
Sorry about our butts touching.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.150
Go into the vents.
They'll never find us there.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.568
I say we take a stand here.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.863
- Someone's gotta win sometime.
- Not if we never kill each other.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.157
- Then we can play forever.
- Right. Wait.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.243
Abed, the floor can't be lava forever.
The game's gotta end.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.667
It's not a game for me. I'm seeing
real lava because you're leaving.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.212
It's embarrassing, and I don't
wanna be crazy, but I am crazy, so...

13:58.713 --> 14:01.758
I made a game that made you
and everyone else see what I see.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.182
I don't want it to be there.
I want you to be able to leave.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.934
I don't think the lava goes away
until you stop leaving.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.770
So the only way I can help you...

14:14.062 --> 14:17.315
is by giving up my chance
to be one person?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.863
You guys ready for closure?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.281
Of your caskets?

14:25.573 --> 14:26.573
Guys, stop, okay?

14:26.824 --> 14:27.867
The lava's real to Abed.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.619
- It's not a game to him.
- Oh, no.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.705
You know what I think?
I think he's used to getting his own way.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.874
I think he's never met me.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.883
Abed. Abed.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.222
Unbelievable.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.725
When this game is over,
I'm gonna shove you back.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.396
Abed, give me your other hand.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.733
It's down to us.
You or Britta will be the winner.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.152
I'm not leaving, okay? Just... I promise.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.488
The floor's not lava.
Just give me your hand.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.282
I don't think the lava's here
because you're leaving.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.494
I think it's here because I won't let go.
Sorry.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.329
- Bye.
- Abed.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.415
Abed. Abed.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.417
Abed!

15:18.334 --> 15:20.420
Abed! Abed!

15:25.842 --> 15:27.427
Abed.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.095
He's fake dead.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.597
Forever.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.268
Shut up.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.937
What? Stop.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.316
He's not really dead.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.903
But he's really playing dead,
and he's not gonna stop.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.195
Here.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.031
Congratulations, you win.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.117
You don't get it.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.161
No one gets Abed.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.620
I got him a little.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.873
This is my fault.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.044
I don't deserve to fake live.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.379
Wait. No.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.881
- I can fix him.
- How?

16:05.173 --> 16:08.759
I don't know. In real life, I don't know,
but I can fake fix him.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.051
SPACE CLONE

16:10.261 --> 16:12.221
- I can clone him. I'll clone him.
- Go on.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.141
I just need his DNA.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.560
Let's get his DNA.
Don't touch the lava.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.228
You might be onto something.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.899
I'm gonna find discarded technology
from this once great civilisation...

16:23.191 --> 16:25.151
and start a cloning machine.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.654
Okay, I'm placing
this cellular regeneration sequencer...

16:28.946 --> 16:30.239
on the spot where he died.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.618
- Here, don't forget this.
- This is a laser guidance system...

16:33.910 --> 16:37.747
that keeps the regeneration sequence
from jib-jabbing.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.165
Jib-jabbing?

16:39.457 --> 16:42.168
Initiate regeneration sequence.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.019
- It worked.
- We made a perfect clone of Abed.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.153
Actually, Britta's work was sloppy.
I'm not an exact replication.

17:09.444 --> 17:13.156
I have Abed's abilities and memories,
but I'm missing his wild emotionality.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.829
Although I think I may be able
to let Troy go now.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.750
I don't know.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.336
I haven't been completely honest.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.171
I'm really scared to go on my trip.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.382
Well, you don't have to go.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.050
Your clone can.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.262
Right.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.162
BORCHERT HALL

18:00.454 --> 18:01.581
GREENDALE

18:02.164 --> 18:03.916
So you guys are all cloned up too,
huh?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.753
- Believe in cloning.
- Well...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.046
CHILDISH TYCOON

18:09.338 --> 18:10.923
Guess that's my ride.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.883
I'm so excited for you.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.594
You're gonna see the world...

18:14.885 --> 18:16.345
and experience new cultures.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.433
All culture has been homogenized
by 50 years of American imperialism...

18:20.725 --> 18:22.935
but at least the candy bar wrappers
will...

18:24.020 --> 18:25.730
God, there I go.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.232
Almost Britta'd our goodbye, huh?
I'm the worst.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.193
You're the best, and I love you.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.616
- I'm better at sex than Jeff, right?
- I've yet to have anyone worse.

18:40.161 --> 18:45.499
All I ever wanted in high school
was for Troy Barnes to notice me...

18:45.791 --> 18:47.793
and then I ended up living with you.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.920
- I'm pretty lucky.
- I'm not.

18:50.212 --> 18:54.592
I had a chance to be your friend in high
school, but I was busy trying to be cool.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.386
I missed out on four more years
of Annie.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.561
You are the coolest guy I know.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.146
I hope I make you proud.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.777
I've never stepped foot
outside of Colorado.

19:13.069 --> 19:16.530
You're becoming much cooler than me
by doing this.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.119
- Thanks for looking out for me.
- Thank you for putting up...

19:22.411 --> 19:24.747
with the boring, old mom
in your study group.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.332
You made a furniture fortress.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.668
You're the badass
from our study group.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.424
Clone Troy.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.301
Clone Abed.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.682
When I cloned you, I had to
patch parts of your DNA...

19:42.973 --> 19:44.600
with genes from a homing pigeon.

19:44.892 --> 19:49.021
You may notice side effects,
like a compulsion to come back.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.482
Cool. Clone hug?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.867
You're really gonna pilot this thing
all on your own?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.703
Pierce's will stated that someone...

20:03.994 --> 20:06.205
would be assigned to me
to verify I don't cheat.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.374
Captain Barnes.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.211
We should set sail while the wind
is still in our favour, don't you think?

20:12.503 --> 20:14.171
Engage.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.395
Troy, I know it's gonna be difficult
for you to interact with me...

20:29.687 --> 20:31.230
No, no. That was the original Troy.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.524
I'm his clone.
Let's get the lead out, Burton.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.692
Aye, aye, sir.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.342
Starting from landlocked Colorado
may not have been the best idea.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.095
Drive to the river
then take the river to the ocean.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.597
I never thought I'd see you.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.433
I have a couple Star Trek questions,
if you don't mind.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.393
No, go ahead.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.440
"What time did you have to get up
in the morning?

21:14.732 --> 21:17.276
Every writer write for one character?
What's a best boy?"

21:17.568 --> 21:20.613
I saw it in the credits once.
"Why don't they call it Planet Trek?"

21:21.906 --> 21:23.741
You never go to a star.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.368
You... Not one episode.
