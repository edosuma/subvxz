01:20.376 --> 01:23.576
<i>- When we first, you know,
walked into the country,</i>

01:23.580 --> 01:27.480
I mean, you had the weight of
the nation on your shoulders.

01:27.483 --> 01:32.220
You know,
we were America's response

01:32.221 --> 01:36.490
To the most catastrophic
terrorist attack on U.S Soil.

01:36.491 --> 01:37.721
- Ever.
- Ever.

01:37.725 --> 01:40.225
- And for a lot of us,

01:40.227 --> 01:45.427
You know, we felt that we
had a responsibility

01:45.431 --> 01:47.198
To the people that died,

01:47.199 --> 01:51.399
To set the stage that you just
don't do that to America

01:51.403 --> 01:52.643
And not pay the price.

01:52.644 --> 01:55.397
It was about...
not retribution,

01:55.406 --> 01:57.406
But it was about justice.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.538
- What's that saying

02:00.544 --> 02:02.644
About, "who will go?"

02:02.646 --> 02:04.306
"send me."

02:04.314 --> 02:05.754
- You know...
- Isaiah 6:8.

02:05.755 --> 02:07.848
- Sir?
- Isaiah 6:8.

02:07.850 --> 02:09.380
"Whom will go,
and whom shall I send?"

02:09.383 --> 02:11.524
- Yeah, "who will go,
and who shall I send?"

02:11.525 --> 02:13.786
Send me, send me,

02:13.787 --> 02:18.517
'cause I'm the dude
that wants to make somebody pay

02:18.525 --> 02:20.615
For killing my brothers
and sisters.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.332
- <i>I think we have to assume</i>

02:32.336 --> 02:35.696
<i>That there will be more attacks.</i>

02:35.706 --> 02:40.606
<i>- The United States military
has begun strikes.</i>

02:40.610 --> 02:46.250
<i>- Coalition warplanes have
free rein over Afghanistan.</i>

02:47.916 --> 02:50.716
<i>- The public, though...
- I think 94% of the public...</i>

02:50.718 --> 02:54.548
<i>Wants us to go in somewhere
and do something.</i>

02:54.555 --> 02:56.655
<i>- U.S. Army Special Forces,
known as the Green Berets...</i>

02:56.657 --> 02:58.687
- <i>The green berets...</i>

02:58.692 --> 03:00.592
- <i>Inside Afghanistan.</i>

03:00.593 --> 03:04.596
<i>Those reports first appeared
in Pakistani newspapers...</i>

03:04.597 --> 03:07.797
<i>- Known as
the quiet professionals...</i>

03:07.800 --> 03:09.800
<i>So secretive,
we've agreed not to disclose</i>

03:09.802 --> 03:11.702
<i>Even their first name.</i>

03:11.703 --> 03:15.443
<i>- I never spoke out the way
I felt like I should have.</i>

03:20.744 --> 03:23.951
<i>- It was an American green Bert
raid in the dark of night.</i>

03:23.952 --> 03:26.378
<i>- Guns starting to flail
back and forth.</i>

03:26.383 --> 03:28.617
<i>pow-pow, pow, pow...</i>

03:28.618 --> 03:32.948
<i>- This is another type
of warfare:</i>

03:32.955 --> 03:34.645
<i>War by guerillas.</i>

03:34.656 --> 03:38.416
- <i>Unconventional warfare.</i>

03:38.426 --> 03:42.826
<i>- And to me,
it's like brotherhood.</i>

03:42.829 --> 03:46.259
- <i>What is winning?</i>

03:46.265 --> 03:47.895
- <i>You're just praying</i>

03:47.899 --> 03:51.799
<i>You'll get to prove yourself
to your brothers.</i>

03:51.802 --> 03:53.769
<i>- What began
as a 100-day mission...</i>

03:53.770 --> 03:55.840
<i>- The longest U.S War...
- It's been a long war...</i>

03:55.841 --> 04:01.976
<i>- The longest war
in American history.</i>

04:01.977 --> 04:04.677
<i>- We've been living it
for 15 years.</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:19.623
- <i>Think I was 10.</i>

04:19.625 --> 04:22.925
<i>Must have been 9 or 10,
about 1970, I guess.</i>

04:22.928 --> 04:25.398
<i>I saw john Wayne,
"the green berets,"</i>

04:25.399 --> 04:29.597
<i>And I thought, "man, yeah..."</i>

04:29.601 --> 04:32.639
- They all seemed to think
that because my dad joined,

04:32.640 --> 04:34.497
That it was natural
for me to join,

04:34.505 --> 04:36.935
But that wasn't the case.

04:36.940 --> 04:39.608
<i>I went to go see a movie.</i>

04:39.609 --> 04:41.376
- Funny thing.

04:41.377 --> 04:43.637
A fella takes one of these
into battle,

04:43.645 --> 04:46.905
And he carries
a strange sense of guilt

04:46.914 --> 04:48.781
All the rest of his life.

04:48.782 --> 04:50.882
<i>- I figured everything else
I'd done in the Army</i>

04:50.884 --> 04:54.353
<i>Hadn't been all that hard,
for me.</i>

04:54.354 --> 04:56.394
<i>I figured, how hard could it be?</i>

05:04.962 --> 05:06.262
It was pretty hard.

05:07.431 --> 05:09.261
Pretty good, yeah.

05:22.576 --> 05:25.706
<i>- The Taliban must turn over
Osama Bin Laden</i>

05:25.713 --> 05:27.853
<i>And must destroy
the terrorist camps.</i>

05:27.854 --> 05:30.648
Otherwise,
there will be a consequence.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.648
<i>- Spokesman for the Taliban
denies Afghanistan</i>

05:34.653 --> 05:37.723
<i>Allowed Bin Laden to strike
from its territory.</i>

05:37.724 --> 05:39.789
- <i>Good afternoon.</i>

05:39.790 --> 05:41.520
<i>On my orders,</i>

05:41.525 --> 05:44.525
<i>The United States military
has begun strikes</i>

05:44.528 --> 05:47.358
<i>Against the Taliban regime
in Afghanistan.</i>

06:42.417 --> 06:46.617
<i>- I'm as close to these people
as anyone in my own family,</i>

06:46.621 --> 06:50.921
<i>And in some ways closer.</i>

06:50.925 --> 06:53.725
<i>These are my 11 best friends
in the world.</i>

06:53.727 --> 06:57.027
<i>That's how I feel.</i>

07:00.833 --> 07:02.833
- This is us in Afghanistan.

07:02.835 --> 07:06.495
I mean, we were in,
you know, some harsh...

07:06.505 --> 07:09.405
- Probably is as extreme
a combat environment

07:09.407 --> 07:11.437
As you can fathom.

07:11.442 --> 07:16.946
<i>It tested you in every way...
physically, mentally...</i>

07:16.947 --> 07:18.477
Emotionally.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.381
- We are it.

07:20.382 --> 07:22.549
And when you need the Army,

07:22.550 --> 07:25.980
We are the vanguard,
the spearhead, the praetorian.

07:25.986 --> 07:28.046
- This has been happening
for, what, 15 years.

07:28.054 --> 07:29.788
- Wow, since Vietnam.

07:29.789 --> 07:31.156
- Yeah.

07:31.157 --> 07:33.717
- We're talking about people.

07:33.726 --> 07:36.486
You know, as a unit,
we've been...

07:36.495 --> 07:39.425
We've been deployed
doing some pretty crazy crap

07:39.431 --> 07:41.131
For a while.

07:41.132 --> 07:43.102
And you get
into a unit like this,

07:43.103 --> 07:44.667
And that's what you do.

07:44.668 --> 07:46.098
That's your game.

07:46.102 --> 07:49.437
- I've been in the military
now 30 years.

07:49.438 --> 07:53.138
<i>That mission was the pinnacle
of my career,</i>

07:53.141 --> 07:55.809
<i>Absolutely the finest thing</i>

07:55.810 --> 07:58.880
A team of green berets could do.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.046
<i>- Mark wasn't on the team
anymore at that time.</i>

08:06.052 --> 08:07.822
So I thought I was good to go.

08:07.823 --> 08:10.820
I was 6 1/2 months pregnant.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.693
And we got a call
while we were in a baby store,

08:13.694 --> 08:14.892
Shopping for baby things.

08:14.893 --> 08:18.593
I think Mr. Paul called him
and said...

08:18.596 --> 08:19.856
- "get your butt back here."

08:19.863 --> 08:22.763
- "guess what,
you're back on the team."

08:22.765 --> 08:25.765
And I was like, "oh..."

08:25.768 --> 08:26.968
- <i>We both realized</i>

08:26.969 --> 08:28.669
I was probably
not gonna be there

08:28.670 --> 08:30.537
For the birth of our child.

08:30.538 --> 08:32.638
On the drive back
from Nashville, then,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.140
We realized we'd
better pick a name.

08:46.853 --> 08:49.791
<i>Amy knew we were gonna go,
but she didn't know where.</i>

08:49.792 --> 08:52.759
<i>Hell, I didn't know
where we were going exactly.</i>

09:22.251 --> 09:23.951
- <i>Ramp runs down a big cloud</i>

09:23.953 --> 09:28.122
<i>Of that fine talcum powder dust.</i>

09:28.123 --> 09:30.723
We come piling
out of the back of that,

09:30.725 --> 09:34.255
<i>Haul all of our shit out in
this big, huge clump of stuff.</i>

09:34.261 --> 09:36.528
<i>Helicopter takes off.</i>

09:36.529 --> 09:37.959
<i>Dust kind of settles,</i>

09:37.963 --> 09:39.903
<i>And out of the dust
comes the sand people.</i>

09:39.904 --> 09:41.598
- <i>That's right.</i>

09:41.599 --> 09:43.069
- <i>When you see a man with an AK</i>

09:43.070 --> 09:46.097
<i>Who's dressed
just like your enemy,</i>

09:46.103 --> 09:47.703
And you've got to walk
over to him

09:47.704 --> 09:49.844
And basically ask him,
"hey, how you doing?"

09:49.845 --> 09:52.969
<i>And you have no idea
whether he's gonna say...</i>

09:52.975 --> 09:54.265
<i>You put out his hand
and shake it,</i>

09:54.276 --> 09:55.906
<i>Or he's gonna shoot you.</i>

09:58.045 --> 10:01.245
<i>- The Taliban's Army
of some 30,000 fighters...</i>

10:03.583 --> 10:06.883
<i>Born from the crucible of war,</i>

10:06.886 --> 10:11.286
<i>Captured Kabul in 1996
and imposed draconian laws.</i>

10:14.293 --> 10:15.733
- <i>Indiscriminate and brutal...</i>

10:16.928 --> 10:18.558
- <i>Whipped in public for adultery</i>

10:18.562 --> 10:19.962
<i>In front
of an all-male audience...</i>

10:19.963 --> 10:21.632
- <i>We have a small group...</i>

10:21.633 --> 10:23.900
<i>- The Taliban
invited Osama Bin Laden...</i>

10:23.901 --> 10:25.799
<i>- Osama Bin Laden
would offer money</i>

10:25.800 --> 10:27.870
<i>And his fighters to fight.</i>

10:41.745 --> 10:43.645
<i>- The northern alliance
came together</i>

10:43.647 --> 10:46.547
<i>In mutual opposition
to the Taliban.</i>

10:48.316 --> 10:51.076
<i>- General Dostum
and his Advance Security Party</i>

10:51.086 --> 10:52.946
Come riding up.

10:52.954 --> 10:55.588
<i>- General Dostum,
who has a fierce reputation</i>

10:55.589 --> 10:56.959
<i>For his treatment
of foreign prisoners.</i>

10:56.960 --> 10:58.757
<i>- He jumps down
off the horse, and...</i>

10:58.758 --> 11:00.428
- Hell, the horse is still
moving, he jumps off.

11:00.429 --> 11:02.927
- Yeah.
- He was like, "hey."

11:02.929 --> 11:06.698
<i>- General Dostum agreed
to take my team members and I</i>

11:06.699 --> 11:09.367
Up to his forward command post.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.998
<i>"I can't guarantee
your safety."</i>

11:11.002 --> 11:12.802
<i>He said, "there's some people</i>

11:12.803 --> 11:16.673
<i>That may be upset
that the Americans are here."</i>

11:18.374 --> 11:23.777
<i>So we would mount horses
for the first time in combat.</i>

11:23.778 --> 11:25.208
- <i>Mark knows horses.</i>

11:25.212 --> 11:27.846
<i>He knew horses
when he got there.</i>

11:27.847 --> 11:29.777
We didn't.

11:29.782 --> 11:31.382
<i>Mark figured out real quick</i>

11:31.383 --> 11:34.153
<i>That you go up to 400 dudes
on a horse and say,</i>

11:34.154 --> 11:35.782
<i>"hey, somebody
get off their horse</i>

11:35.786 --> 11:37.186
<i>And give it to an American,"</i>

11:37.187 --> 11:40.217
<i>You ain't gonna get
a smooth horse.</i>

11:40.223 --> 11:44.059
<i>- We got to General Dostum's
headquarters.</i>

11:44.060 --> 11:45.427
<i>My job at that point</i>

11:45.428 --> 11:49.798
<i>Is to establish
and maintain rapport.</i>

11:49.799 --> 11:51.399
<i>His plan
that he had briefed to us</i>

11:51.400 --> 11:56.137
<i>Was that Mazar-e Sharif
was the key to the country,</i>

11:56.138 --> 11:58.168
<i>And if we could liberate
Mazar-e Sharif,</i>

11:58.173 --> 12:01.141
<i>The northern provinces
would be liberated.</i>

12:01.142 --> 12:03.382
<i>If we liberated
the northern provinces,</i>

12:03.383 --> 12:06.407
<i>Then Kabul could be liberated.</i>

12:06.413 --> 12:12.283
<i>And from there, Herat,
Kandahar, Jalalabad.</i>

12:12.284 --> 12:14.852
<i>We represented 5th group.</i>

12:14.853 --> 12:17.393
<i>We represented America's
foreign policy...</i>

12:17.394 --> 12:23.288
At the point end, nasty, dirty,
<i>bloody end of that fight...</i>

12:23.293 --> 12:25.727
<i>That we went in
and helped enable</i>

12:25.728 --> 12:28.058
<i>The possibility
of a brighter future</i>

12:28.063 --> 12:30.233
<i>For the people of Afghanistan.</i>

12:48.078 --> 12:50.747
- It was my first rodeo.

12:50.748 --> 12:53.748
We got married in April;
He left in October.

12:56.918 --> 12:58.148
He was a medic.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.123
I thought it was safe.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.892
Yeah, he lied to me, guys.

13:05.157 --> 13:07.157
No, he didn't lie to me;
He was a medic.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.259
- Is that what they're called?

13:08.260 --> 13:09.290
- I don't know.

13:09.294 --> 13:11.294
You know what it is.

13:11.296 --> 13:12.926
- Little dust off that.

13:12.930 --> 13:15.960
- A pickle tea.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.796
- A lot of memories,
you know what I mean?

13:17.801 --> 13:21.970
It's like... that you kind of
tamp down and put away.

13:21.971 --> 13:24.501
Not so good, but that's okay.

13:24.506 --> 13:26.536
<i>- Every one of the husbands
will tell you</i>

13:26.541 --> 13:30.441
<i>That they're gonna die
before us spouses do.</i>

13:33.814 --> 13:35.852
- Suck it up, buttercup.
- Suck it up, will.

13:35.853 --> 13:38.179
- Hey, how about we toast
to everybody who's not here?

13:38.184 --> 13:39.524
- Yeah, there you go.

13:39.525 --> 13:42.786
- 'Cause we got chad,
we got Pete...

13:42.787 --> 13:45.887
- Pete.
- We got Steve.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.520
- Bill.
- Bill, wherever you are.

13:47.524 --> 13:48.957
- Wherever he's at.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.988
- Salud.
- Salud.

13:53.928 --> 13:55.088
- Whoo!

13:55.096 --> 13:56.196
That shit's nasty.

13:56.197 --> 13:57.557
- What is this shit?

14:06.172 --> 14:09.872
- Hey.

14:09.876 --> 14:11.036
Say hello.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.907
Come on.

14:17.915 --> 14:19.545
<i>It wasn't until you were
forced to retire,</i>

14:19.549 --> 14:21.249
<i>You had to retire.</i>

14:21.250 --> 14:23.550
<i>Then you isolated yourself
from your family</i>

14:23.552 --> 14:24.818
<i>And everybody else.</i>

14:24.819 --> 14:26.149
<i>You internalize everything.</i>

14:26.153 --> 14:28.553
You try to find a new normalcy.

14:33.191 --> 14:35.226
- Off.

14:35.227 --> 14:38.187
Sit, sit, sit.

14:38.196 --> 14:40.156
Psst, sit.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.867
What I found kind of peace with

14:45.869 --> 14:48.399
<i>Is to go out here,
crawl around on jeeps</i>

14:48.404 --> 14:50.604
<i>And, you know, be one again.</i>

14:55.242 --> 14:57.942
Being out here, I mean, listen.

15:00.614 --> 15:03.924
You know, you get to have
no thoughts at all.

15:16.027 --> 15:19.897
<i>Each one of our stories
are almost similar,</i>

15:19.898 --> 15:26.868
<i>How we isolated ourselves,
our family, everything else.</i>

15:26.871 --> 15:29.038
Started reaching out and found,

15:29.039 --> 15:31.039
<i>You know, the only way we're
all gonna heal each other</i>

15:31.041 --> 15:32.611
<i>Is to get back together.</i>

15:34.277 --> 15:37.077
- Holy shit.
- That's that blooper.

15:37.079 --> 15:38.139
- Oh, there we go.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.176
Big Marky Mark.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.480
- Marky Mark.

15:56.929 --> 15:58.929
- I'm up here somewhere.

15:58.932 --> 16:00.499
That's me right there.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.330
<i>- You know, in special forces,
you have a team,</i>

16:02.335 --> 16:04.395
<i>And a team is 12 men.</i>

16:04.403 --> 16:06.003
<i>You've got a Captain,
a team sergeant,</i>

16:06.004 --> 16:07.273
<i>A team warrant officer,</i>

16:07.274 --> 16:08.671
Two Engineers, two Commo,

16:08.672 --> 16:10.910
Two medics,
two weapons sergeants.

16:10.911 --> 16:12.267
<i>That formulates a team,</i>

16:12.275 --> 16:14.475
<i>And each team
would have a specialty,</i>

16:14.477 --> 16:17.407
<i>Like high-altitude,
low-opening jumping</i>

16:17.413 --> 16:19.480
<i>Or scuba diving</i>

16:19.481 --> 16:21.911
<i>Or assaulting direct action.</i>

16:26.352 --> 16:28.587
- <i>I was the greatest tactician</i>

16:28.588 --> 16:32.018
<i>For direct action
that there was.</i>

16:32.024 --> 16:35.626
<i>Back then, I thought I was
on top of the world.</i>

16:35.627 --> 16:37.127
- <i>In the back.</i>

16:37.128 --> 16:38.658
- Right here?
- Yes.

16:38.662 --> 16:41.200
<i>- General franks,
again, on special forces,</i>

16:41.201 --> 16:43.457
<i>Can you give us a sense
of how the size and scope</i>

16:43.465 --> 16:46.125
Of their mission will expand
over the next month,

16:46.134 --> 16:48.474
From classic liaison
with northern alliance groups

16:48.475 --> 16:49.936
And reconnaissance,

16:49.937 --> 16:51.237
To more direct action,

16:51.238 --> 16:54.568
Shoot-em-up ambush
type of situations?

16:54.574 --> 16:57.609
- A short answer,
and that is that...

16:57.610 --> 17:00.210
One should not assume
that there has not been

17:00.212 --> 17:03.282
Strategic reconnaissance
and direct action activity.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.211
<i>You would not expect for me
to tell you</i>

17:05.215 --> 17:09.016
<i>Exactly what they're doing.</i>

17:09.019 --> 17:11.589
<i>- Evidence that another,
much more covert operation</i>

17:11.589 --> 17:13.288
<i>Is well under way...</i>

17:13.289 --> 17:14.989
<i>- These special forces
are trying to hunt down</i>

17:14.990 --> 17:16.720
<i>Suspected terrorist
Osama Bin Laden...</i>

17:16.724 --> 17:19.555
<i>- The letter-like attacks
by commandos</i>

17:19.560 --> 17:23.060
<i>To go after and root out
some of that infrastructure.</i>

17:27.200 --> 17:30.670
<i>- The mission statement
was to kill or capture</i>

17:30.671 --> 17:35.708
Senior Al-Qaeda
and Taliban leadership, stop.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.239
<i>Insert name, stop.</i>

17:38.244 --> 17:40.578
<i>Insert location, stop.</i>

17:40.579 --> 17:43.209
<i>At our level,
there was a big map there,</i>

17:43.214 --> 17:46.649
And the big map is synchronized
<i>by who's next,</i>

17:46.650 --> 17:48.517
<i>Who's on first, okay?</i>

17:48.518 --> 17:50.718
<i>And then, who's on first
is a number</i>

17:50.720 --> 17:53.090
And a picture
and a little bit of background.

17:54.557 --> 17:56.357
<i>Went into one room,
it was total chaos.</i>

17:56.358 --> 17:58.058
<i>Seven guys, machine guys,</i>

17:58.059 --> 17:59.759
<i>Dodging bullets,
shooting people, hand-to-hand.</i>

17:59.760 --> 18:01.527
<i>You run into the next room,</i>

18:01.528 --> 18:03.088
<i>Guys are shooting
out the back of the window.</i>

18:03.096 --> 18:04.456
<i>One guy is surrendering.</i>

18:04.464 --> 18:06.464
<i>You went into the next room,
bam.</i>

18:09.368 --> 18:12.468
It was on-off, on-off,
on-off, on-off, on...

18:12.471 --> 18:14.471
Helicopter home.

18:34.124 --> 18:37.231
<i>As a kid, I was forced
to read homer's "odyssey,"</i>

18:37.232 --> 18:39.628
You know, about a warrior king
trying to come home

18:39.630 --> 18:41.560
And the family
going through its situation.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.095
You never really understand it,

18:43.099 --> 18:44.629
Because you don't have
the maturity.

18:44.633 --> 18:48.702
Now, you know, you're trying
to find, you know,

18:48.703 --> 18:51.471
The subtleties
and calmness of life.

18:51.472 --> 18:53.372
That, right now,
is more valuable

18:53.373 --> 18:55.243
Than a million dollars
in the bank.

19:08.118 --> 19:10.487
- <i>As a leader,</i>

19:10.488 --> 19:13.288
<i>You have to balance, you know,
"what's the mission?</i>

19:13.290 --> 19:14.620
<i>What are you trying
to accomplish?"</i>

19:14.624 --> 19:16.124
<i>And the mission is invariably</i>

19:16.125 --> 19:18.085
To put your soldiers
in harm's way.

19:18.093 --> 19:19.726
<i>So, I think, as a soldier,</i>

19:19.727 --> 19:21.527
<i>There's a part of you that,
as an individual,</i>

19:21.528 --> 19:24.128
<i>You want to see it,
to understand it,</i>

19:24.130 --> 19:26.060
<i>To be tested by it.</i>

19:26.065 --> 19:27.765
<i>But then, as a leader,</i>

19:27.767 --> 19:30.827
You're so terrified
at the thought

19:30.836 --> 19:37.206
Of making bad decisions
that get your soldiers killed.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.776
- You need a very strong
team leader.

19:39.777 --> 19:42.377
<i>Amerine was outstanding.</i>

19:42.379 --> 19:43.779
- <i>It's like a democracy.</i>

19:43.780 --> 19:45.480
You've got to
kind of, you know...

19:47.648 --> 19:48.778
There's strong wills.

19:48.783 --> 19:51.518
<i>12 strong wills.</i>

19:51.519 --> 19:53.589
<i>- You're stuck
with this bunch of guys</i>

19:53.590 --> 19:56.787
<i>And thrown into Afghanistan.</i>

19:56.790 --> 19:58.557
And it was just fun.

19:58.558 --> 20:01.388
Yeah, it was awesome.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.370
<i>- You know,
we identified Tarin Kowt</i>

20:10.371 --> 20:16.769
<i>As the first step
in our campaigns.</i>

20:16.774 --> 20:18.944
<i>The goal was, seize Kandahar.</i>

20:33.287 --> 20:36.456
<i>I met Hamid for the first time
in the hallway.</i>

20:36.457 --> 20:37.887
<i>You know, he was going
to the bathroom,</i>

20:37.891 --> 20:40.221
<i>And I was walking
to get some coffee,</i>

20:40.226 --> 20:44.256
<i>And it was just men
trying to work with one another</i>

20:44.263 --> 20:47.331
<i>That didn't have
any time for bullshit.</i>

20:47.332 --> 20:48.932
<i>Even as all the tensions rose</i>

20:48.933 --> 20:51.801
<i>Between the U.S
And Hamid Karzai,</i>

20:51.802 --> 20:55.971
He still had an uncanny ability

20:55.972 --> 20:59.642
<i>To hold things together
over there.</i>

21:09.550 --> 21:14.350
<i>I think it was around
3:00 in the morning or so.</i>

21:14.355 --> 21:18.755
<i>The F-18s spotted a small
convoy of trucks heading north.</i>

21:25.297 --> 21:28.427
<i>So here are these F-18s
flying overhead,</i>

21:28.434 --> 21:31.474
<i>And they're calling
for permission to engage.</i>

21:31.475 --> 21:34.638
<i>And that was when...
that was then the war</i>

21:34.639 --> 21:36.439
<i>Really became real.</i>

21:40.342 --> 21:45.580
<i>There was just this moment
where Alan looks at me</i>

21:45.581 --> 21:47.650
<i>And says, you know,
"are they clear to engage?"</i>

21:47.651 --> 21:49.779
<i>And, like, everybody
was suddenly quiet.</i>

21:49.784 --> 21:53.686
<i>I mean, I was...</i>

21:53.687 --> 21:55.747
<i>I was gonna authorize
these F-18s</i>

21:55.755 --> 22:01.455
To drop bombs on pickup trucks
that were likely the enemy.

22:01.460 --> 22:04.330
But, you know,
what if I was wrong?

22:07.764 --> 22:14.003
<i>And it was the silence
that always sticks with me.</i>

22:14.004 --> 22:15.644
<i>You know,
"are they clear to engage?"</i>

22:15.645 --> 22:19.768
<i>And suddenly all eyes are on me.</i>

22:19.775 --> 22:26.445
<i>I looked at Allen,
and I said, "smoke 'em."</i>

22:26.448 --> 22:30.348
<i>And after I said the words,</i>

22:30.351 --> 22:32.021
<i>It was just sort of,
where did that come from?</i>

22:32.022 --> 22:33.349
<i>Smoke 'em?</i>

22:33.353 --> 22:34.493
<i>I don't say shit like that.</i>

22:34.494 --> 22:36.317
<i>I mean, that's just not me.</i>

22:38.924 --> 22:40.993
<i>The thing we didn't
realize, though,</i>

22:40.994 --> 22:43.892
<i>Is that these trucks weren't
the leading edge of the convoy.</i>

22:43.894 --> 22:45.864
<i>They were actually
at the tail of the convoy</i>

22:45.865 --> 22:49.898
<i>Of maybe 1,000 Taliban.</i>

22:49.899 --> 22:52.029
<i>- So we're just kind of lookin',
you know, with Binos,</i>

22:52.034 --> 22:54.869
And we saw this glimmer.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.440
<i>- I mean, these guys
were coming heavy,</i>

22:56.441 --> 22:59.768
<i>And we're talking 23mm guns.</i>

22:59.774 --> 23:02.809
A 23mm is, like, that big.

23:02.810 --> 23:06.110
I mean, it will...
it will blow you, "pah."

23:06.113 --> 23:08.047
<i>You'll be like mist.</i>

23:08.048 --> 23:09.778
- <i>We tell the pilots,</i>

23:09.783 --> 23:12.751
<i>"okay, we're the two truck
right there."</i>

23:12.752 --> 23:14.721
<i>And the pilots would go like,
"that's it."</i>

23:14.722 --> 23:18.490
"yep, that's us; Everybody else
<i>is the enemy south of us."</i>

23:19.922 --> 23:21.562
<i>We were fucked.</i>

23:26.828 --> 23:32.798
<i>- And Yoshida assured us,
he's like, "man, I'm on tune.</i>

23:32.799 --> 23:35.129
<i>"I'm talking to these pilots.</i>

23:35.134 --> 23:36.474
We're knocking them out."

23:42.573 --> 23:45.113
<i>And he would just keep saying,
"cleared hot, cleared hot."</i>

23:45.114 --> 23:46.938
<i>Through the whole night,</i>

23:46.943 --> 23:49.443
<i>It just kept going further
and further and further.</i>

23:49.445 --> 23:52.045
And we just, like, bombed out,
like 100 vehicles

23:52.047 --> 23:53.747
Through the whole night.

23:53.748 --> 23:54.978
"Pop-pop-pop."

24:06.824 --> 24:09.464
- I mean, I don't know that we
were high-fiving and euphoric.

24:09.465 --> 24:10.690
It's like, "whew."

24:10.694 --> 24:14.930
We were just trying to win...
and live.

24:14.931 --> 24:21.031
<i>- I think, for me, the notion
of fighting from a distance,</i>

24:21.036 --> 24:26.806
Of fighting
with these airstrikes,

24:26.808 --> 24:28.138
It didn't sit well with me.

24:28.142 --> 24:30.742
I mean, it...

24:30.744 --> 24:34.813
It almost promoted
just the promiscuous use

24:34.814 --> 24:39.083
Of military power.

24:39.084 --> 24:40.684
I don't know how to explain it.

24:40.685 --> 24:42.415
It's just...

24:42.420 --> 24:43.920
I mean, we would
have died otherwise.

24:43.921 --> 24:45.721
There was no alternative.

24:45.722 --> 24:49.758
But something just didn't
feel quite right about it.

24:49.759 --> 24:53.528
I mean, in the end,
we slaughtered them, you know.

24:53.529 --> 24:55.529
And as they were retreating,
we kept bombing them.

24:55.531 --> 24:59.831
I mean, we wiped them out.

24:59.835 --> 25:05.705
<i>But I didn't feel good
about how we had to do it.</i>

25:05.707 --> 25:07.807
<i>I just felt like...</i>

25:07.809 --> 25:10.109
<i>Felt like I should have been
looking the enemy in the eye</i>

25:10.111 --> 25:14.611
<i>Before I killed him.</i>

25:14.615 --> 25:18.175
<i>- We went down, and we started
doing battle damage assessment</i>

25:18.185 --> 25:22.215
<i>And counting, you know,
destroyed vehicles.</i>

25:22.222 --> 25:23.822
And, you know, in some of them,

25:23.823 --> 25:25.163
<i>There were still
some charred bodies</i>

25:25.164 --> 25:28.826
<i>That were just...</i>

25:28.827 --> 25:31.027
<i>They're traveling
in these little Toyota trucks,</i>

25:31.029 --> 25:33.198
<i>And you jam as many guys
in the back of the truck</i>

25:33.199 --> 25:35.497
<i>And as many guys in the front
of the truck as you could.</i>

25:35.499 --> 25:37.229
<i>So there might be
eight or nine people</i>

25:37.234 --> 25:39.068
<i>In a Toyota truck,</i>

25:39.069 --> 25:43.169
<i>And there was, you know,
hundreds of those trucks.</i>

25:43.173 --> 25:44.873
- I don't know
how to describe it.

25:44.874 --> 25:46.074
It was just...

25:50.478 --> 25:52.508
It was just what it is,
you know?

25:55.182 --> 25:58.021
You just... you're, like,
initially kind of...

25:58.022 --> 26:00.919
I don't want to say shocked,
but you're just like, "wow."

26:00.921 --> 26:02.690
I mean, you're seeing people

26:02.691 --> 26:04.989
<i>That are literally
burnt and charred to death.</i>

26:04.991 --> 26:08.191
<i>You know, you're like,
"ooh, wow."</i>

26:08.194 --> 26:10.163
<i>- That was the first
of any of that carnage</i>

26:10.164 --> 26:12.700
<i>That I had seen, you know,
with my own two eyes.</i>

26:12.701 --> 26:14.497
It didn't really bother me.

26:14.498 --> 26:18.167
It was just kind of gruesome,
whatever.

26:18.168 --> 26:20.836
<i>But you're the enemy,
and so it's okay.</i>

26:20.837 --> 26:23.867
<i>And that's kind of
how you programmed it.</i>

26:23.873 --> 26:26.543
<i>"If I don't do this to you,
you're gonna do it to me."</i>

26:26.544 --> 26:29.882
<i>And it's really that simple.</i>

26:52.965 --> 26:55.065
<i>- One of the things people...
- they just...</i>

26:55.068 --> 26:58.598
First thing out of their mouth,
<i>"how many people you kill?"</i>

27:01.973 --> 27:03.943
I didn't know we were counting.

27:03.944 --> 27:06.080
<i>I didn't know
we were supposed to count.</i>

27:06.081 --> 27:07.837
<i>If you know how many people
you've killed,</i>

27:07.845 --> 27:13.575
<i>It's probably not enough.</i>

27:13.583 --> 27:16.083
- It's not a scorecard.
- It's not a scorecard.

27:16.085 --> 27:17.645
- You know, it's...

27:17.653 --> 27:18.922
- And there's a difference

27:18.923 --> 27:21.150
Between shooting somebody
face-to-face

27:21.155 --> 27:23.045
And somebody from a distance
dropping a bomb.

27:23.056 --> 27:24.586
It's impersonal,
you know what I mean?

27:24.590 --> 27:25.620
"Ah, got him.

27:25.624 --> 27:27.662
Ooh, dust, whoo-hoo, high-five."

27:27.663 --> 27:29.859
You know,
little bit longer shot,

27:29.861 --> 27:32.161
"wow, the mechanics
of that shot was great."

27:32.163 --> 27:36.166
Face-to-face, I could tell you
what they smelled like,

27:36.167 --> 27:38.697
You know, how long
it took them to bleed.

27:38.702 --> 27:41.272
Some guys can't get rid
of the smell, okay?

27:41.273 --> 27:42.838
Smell of a burning body

27:42.839 --> 27:44.739
Is different than
the smell of a burning tire.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.670
And you never know
until you walk by

27:46.675 --> 27:49.075
And you're like, "oh, shit,"

27:49.077 --> 27:51.177
'cause that smell is now
implanted in your brain,

27:51.179 --> 27:52.779
What that means.

27:52.780 --> 27:55.880
- My beard was covered in blood.

27:55.883 --> 27:59.619
I mean, I didn't
just see, smell; I tasted.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.290
I thought I'd broke my nose,
but then I realized,

28:02.291 --> 28:06.589
I didn't get hit by anything,
and why am I bleeding?

28:06.593 --> 28:09.828
And, oh, it wasn't my blood.

28:09.829 --> 28:13.229
And I still... I will get
that flash smell on occasion,

28:13.232 --> 28:14.632
And it'll take me right back.

28:14.633 --> 28:16.767
You just... that's...

28:16.768 --> 28:19.268
You know, that's the horror
of it all.

28:19.270 --> 28:20.800
It's very personal.

28:49.264 --> 28:53.167
<i>- I grew up with that
strong American cowboy,</i>

28:53.168 --> 28:56.336
<i>U.S. Cavalry Heritage.</i>

28:56.337 --> 29:01.767
<i>I was probably on a horse
before I could walk.</i>

29:01.775 --> 29:04.005
<i>You know, I'd studied U.S
And confederate</i>

29:04.010 --> 29:05.877
<i>Cavalry commanders.</i>

29:05.878 --> 29:09.078
<i>We had walked the battlefields
of Gettysburg</i>

29:09.081 --> 29:12.716
<i>And down through
the Tennessee campaign.</i>

29:12.717 --> 29:15.847
It was not lost on me
that here I am,

29:15.854 --> 29:18.188
<i>In the 21st century,</i>

29:18.189 --> 29:23.759
<i>And I'm leading
a 19th century cavalry.</i>

29:31.434 --> 29:35.336
<i>- One of the things
about the sf guys,</i>

29:35.337 --> 29:37.437
<i>Most of them are kind of
rough and tumble guys</i>

29:37.439 --> 29:38.939
<i>To begin with.</i>

29:50.848 --> 29:53.878
- She goes, I expect...

29:53.885 --> 29:55.985
- And just slide the bar
the other day with that...

29:55.987 --> 29:57.287
- There's no weight behind that.

29:57.288 --> 29:58.888
- No, put that down first.

29:58.889 --> 30:00.319
Put that down.

30:00.323 --> 30:03.558
<i>- The way I grew up
in west Virginia,</i>

30:03.559 --> 30:05.326
It was clan-ish, you know.

30:05.327 --> 30:07.827
Certain hollows, all these
families lived up this one.

30:07.829 --> 30:09.529
All these families
live up that one.

30:09.530 --> 30:13.130
And, you know, if you make
an enemy of one guy here,

30:13.133 --> 30:14.500
There's more.

30:14.501 --> 30:15.801
- Afghani...

30:19.806 --> 30:22.006
<i>- Yeah, understanding
how tribal people think</i>

30:22.008 --> 30:24.268
Is obviously gonna help.

30:28.179 --> 30:30.249
<i>- Every one of these leaders
told us,</i>

30:30.250 --> 30:33.377
<i>Do not become portrayed
as the invaders.</i>

30:33.383 --> 30:34.853
<i>You're here as liberators.</i>

30:34.854 --> 30:36.818
<i>That's what you've said.</i>

30:36.819 --> 30:38.519
<i>Because we were so few guys,</i>

30:38.520 --> 30:41.120
<i>We could actually portray</i>

30:41.122 --> 30:43.560
<i>That Taliban are actually
the foreign invaders,</i>

30:43.561 --> 30:46.357
The Pakistani Taliban
that had come over,

30:46.359 --> 30:48.229
<i>The Al-Qaeda
that had taken over</i>

30:48.230 --> 30:50.887
<i>And hijacked
these people's country.</i>

30:50.896 --> 30:52.296
- Straight ahead.
- Straight ahead.

30:52.297 --> 30:54.027
- That is foreign Taliban.
- Foreign Taliban.

30:54.032 --> 30:55.462
- Okay, the one to the left...

30:57.167 --> 31:00.027
- <i>We've now raised this Army,</i>

31:00.036 --> 31:02.536
Who are gonna rise up
across the northern provinces,

31:02.538 --> 31:07.868
<i>And we're gonna press
for Mazar-e Sharif.</i>

31:07.876 --> 31:13.546
<i>The situation dictated
that we needed to decentralize.</i>

31:13.548 --> 31:15.578
<i>Each of these
three-man cells, then,</i>

31:15.583 --> 31:20.553
<i>Is tasked to support
an afghan commander</i>

31:20.554 --> 31:25.024
<i>That had between
300 to 750 fighters.</i>

31:25.025 --> 31:30.025
<i>Each of those cells is a four-
to eight-hour horse ride.</i>

31:33.031 --> 31:35.566
<i>It was hot, dusty, dirty,</i>

31:35.567 --> 31:38.937
<i>Riding the meanest, rankest,
nastiest horse.</i>

31:41.439 --> 31:43.139
<i>- I rode Vince's horse
that one time.</i>

31:43.140 --> 31:44.370
- <i>Rusty?</i>

31:44.374 --> 31:46.011
- I was like,
"oh, my god, Vince,

31:46.012 --> 31:48.208
How are you staying
on this thing"

31:48.210 --> 31:50.340
- That horse was cross-bred
with a werewolf.

31:51.412 --> 31:52.979
That thing...

31:52.980 --> 31:54.549
<i>- The Americans
would get bucked off.</i>

31:54.550 --> 31:56.548
<i>The afghans would
get bucked off.</i>

31:56.550 --> 31:58.620
<i>And everybody would
kind of cheer.</i>

31:58.621 --> 32:01.088
<i>That was another
bonding experience.</i>

32:06.257 --> 32:08.887
<i>- Extraordinary
defense department photo</i>

32:08.893 --> 32:10.393
Released today.

32:10.394 --> 32:13.094
<i>United states special forces
on horseback.</i>

32:13.096 --> 32:15.356
<i>- When was the last time
you saw U.S. Military Personnel</i>

32:15.364 --> 32:16.964
<i>In combat on horseback?</i>

32:16.965 --> 32:18.525
- Haven't had them in combat
in a long time.

32:18.533 --> 32:20.173
That's a tough mission.

32:29.208 --> 32:32.538
- Not till I saw him on TV.

32:32.545 --> 32:34.305
- Yeah, that was
kind of a giveaway.

32:34.313 --> 32:36.351
- Yeah, that was
when I got the phone call

32:36.352 --> 32:37.578
At 3:00 in the morning.

32:37.582 --> 32:39.382
- Well, and 2 and 2
still make 4.

32:39.383 --> 32:42.583
It's like, "oh, let's see,
where could they be?

32:42.586 --> 32:44.186
Afghanistan perhaps?"

32:44.187 --> 32:45.647
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:45.655 --> 32:48.315
<i>- We couldn't talk
about where we were at</i>

32:48.324 --> 32:50.194
<i>Or anything we were about to do.</i>

32:50.195 --> 32:53.160
<i>And coming back
from a skirmish, then,</i>

32:53.161 --> 32:55.661
<i>I get a message:</i>

32:55.663 --> 32:59.966
"Something's wrong; Call home."

32:59.967 --> 33:02.227
- <i>I had...</i>

33:02.235 --> 33:03.495
I had Kaya.

33:03.502 --> 33:06.036
And Michelle, bless her heart,

33:06.037 --> 33:07.267
She was on the phone,

33:07.271 --> 33:09.071
Trying to find a way
to get a hold of Mark

33:09.072 --> 33:12.342
To let him know that I had
delivered our daughter.

33:12.343 --> 33:15.541
And... but I didn't hear
from him

33:15.544 --> 33:18.144
Till we were already
discharged and at home

33:18.146 --> 33:19.376
Several days later.

33:19.380 --> 33:20.980
- Amy went in
for an appointment,

33:20.981 --> 33:22.448
A normal appointment,

33:22.449 --> 33:24.279
And there were some
complications, evidently,

33:24.284 --> 33:26.551
And the ob specialist

33:26.552 --> 33:28.652
Said, "you're having
this baby today."

33:28.654 --> 33:31.054
And it was over, what,
a month early?

33:31.056 --> 33:35.316
- Yeah, she said I had two hours
to get my affairs in order,

33:35.326 --> 33:37.226
And I was not to leave,

33:37.227 --> 33:39.587
That I had to stay
on the hospital grounds.

33:39.596 --> 33:40.726
So I called...

33:40.730 --> 33:41.730
- She called these wasps.

33:41.731 --> 33:42.731
- These ladies.

33:42.732 --> 33:44.032
- And they came.

33:44.033 --> 33:45.333
And from what I understand,

33:45.334 --> 33:48.034
Every one of you
were in the delivery room.

33:48.036 --> 33:49.366
- But it's what you do.

33:49.370 --> 33:50.970
You just do what you have to do

33:50.971 --> 33:52.540
To keep your house in order,

33:52.541 --> 33:55.169
To keep your kids doing what
they're supposed to be doing.

33:55.174 --> 33:56.240
- And safe.

33:56.241 --> 33:57.471
- Yeah.

33:57.475 --> 33:59.165
And while they're doing
what they do,

33:59.176 --> 34:00.536
You do what you have to do,

34:00.544 --> 34:03.144
And that's just the way we are.

34:03.146 --> 34:06.706
That's the way
this group of ladies are.

34:06.716 --> 34:08.275
- Bounce back.

34:08.284 --> 34:10.024
You know, they teach you that
in the Q course.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.518
They teach you that in
ranger school, in sere school.

34:12.521 --> 34:14.121
You just have to bounce back.

34:14.121 --> 34:19.331
So I regrouped,
took a deep breath, and...

34:23.396 --> 34:26.255
We're about to go into battle.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.403
- Morning wood.

35:10.039 --> 35:11.269
- I wish we had that...

35:15.344 --> 35:16.477
The froth, you'll see.

35:16.478 --> 35:17.478
- Yeah, whatever.

35:17.479 --> 35:21.409
- Worth $7 a cup.

35:21.416 --> 35:23.346
I want to do something, man.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.800
<i>- You know there's
gonna be a fight.</i>

35:39.801 --> 35:43.499
<i>What are you gonna do,
slap each other?</i>

35:43.502 --> 35:45.171
<i>There's a breaking of a wrist,</i>

35:45.172 --> 35:47.400
<i>A breaking of a finger
that's on you.</i>

35:47.405 --> 35:50.635
<i>There's a chewing of a nose off.</i>

35:55.077 --> 35:57.237
- <i>We hit one of the compounds,</i>

35:57.246 --> 35:59.746
And you could just tell
right away, you know,

35:59.748 --> 36:02.378
That it was gonna be
a difficult hit.

36:02.383 --> 36:04.353
- <i>They're on building one.</i>

36:07.652 --> 36:09.286
- <i>You had less than one hour</i>

36:09.287 --> 36:10.847
<i>From the time
you left the helicopter,</i>

36:10.855 --> 36:13.485
Because if you weren't on
the helicopter in another hour,

36:13.490 --> 36:16.620
They would fly off for 24 hours,
and you had to stay there.

36:16.626 --> 36:19.486
- Unlike you, we didn't have
any Afghani counterparts.

36:19.495 --> 36:21.655
We were... it was us,
on our own,

36:21.663 --> 36:24.297
And we were out
in bad guy country

36:24.298 --> 36:25.698
With no support.

36:25.699 --> 36:28.399
- And we breached
into the house,

36:28.401 --> 36:30.370
<i>And it's all squishy
and everything.</i>

36:30.371 --> 36:32.399
<i>We're walking around,
we're like, "what he heck?"</i>

36:32.404 --> 36:34.171
<i>Well, at the time,
we didn't realize</i>

36:34.172 --> 36:35.502
<i>That they didn't have beds
or furniture.</i>

36:35.506 --> 36:37.366
<i>They just piled rugs.</i>

36:37.374 --> 36:38.607
<i>So we're under night vision.</i>

36:38.608 --> 36:39.738
<i>You could barely see anything.</i>

36:39.742 --> 36:41.342
Your eyes were going glean.

36:41.343 --> 36:43.212
<i>And on the floor,
you saw some movement,</i>

36:43.213 --> 36:45.411
<i>You know, squirming,
like, "what the heck?"</i>

36:45.413 --> 36:46.413
<i>I was a big guy then,</i>

36:46.414 --> 36:47.883
And tony was twice as big as me.

36:47.884 --> 36:50.182
We're looking,
and all of a sudden,

36:50.184 --> 36:52.824
We see two little hands come up
from this blanket

36:52.825 --> 36:54.349
And lift it over,

36:54.353 --> 36:56.453
And looks up
and sees green little eyes,

36:56.455 --> 36:59.485
And she sits up for second,
squeezes her eyes like this.

36:59.491 --> 37:01.421
And I'm like...

37:01.426 --> 37:02.826
You know, you don't want
to say nothing,

37:02.827 --> 37:04.557
Because her dad could be
in the next room.

37:04.562 --> 37:05.828
We all got kids.

37:05.829 --> 37:08.497
Imagine your girl
starts screaming.

37:08.498 --> 37:09.728
<i>So all of a sudden, she did.</i>

37:09.732 --> 37:11.402
She started screaming
and going nuts.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.230
We're like...

37:13.235 --> 37:15.465
- Yeah, yeah, "be quiet."

37:18.805 --> 37:20.435
- <i>So I pick her up.</i>

37:20.440 --> 37:21.770
Starts screaming even more.

37:28.445 --> 37:30.805
<i>One of the other rooms
had caught fire.</i>

37:30.815 --> 37:32.705
<i>So now she's really
screaming and going crazy.</i>

37:32.716 --> 37:34.316
- We could hear it
over the radio.

37:34.317 --> 37:35.717
- Yeah, so you could
hear it on the...

37:35.718 --> 37:37.348
- And I'm like...
- 'cause we were outside.

37:37.352 --> 37:38.652
- We were all
on different houses.

37:38.653 --> 37:40.691
- Yeah, we were outside
in a gunfight.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.988
<i>- I remember I had
a baby Ruth bar,</i>

37:42.990 --> 37:44.590
<i>So I reach in my pocket,</i>

37:44.591 --> 37:46.421
I pull out a little
baby Ruth bar.

37:46.426 --> 37:48.356
I'm like... you know,
she doesn't know what candy is.

37:48.361 --> 37:49.891
Going like this,

37:49.895 --> 37:52.525
And she's screaming and turning
her head and everything.

37:52.530 --> 37:53.960
I put it on my lips,
and I put it on her lips,

37:53.964 --> 37:56.534
And she licks her lips,
and she's like, "huh?"

37:56.535 --> 37:58.467
<i>I came around the corner,</i>

37:58.468 --> 38:00.668
<i>Where they were kind of lining
up some other family members.</i>

38:00.670 --> 38:02.600
And I come out of the darkness.

38:02.605 --> 38:04.035
<i>And I think it was
Rodney Trosco at the time,</i>

38:04.039 --> 38:06.669
Going, "what the fuck
are you doing?"

38:06.674 --> 38:08.274
You know, "put the kid down.

38:08.275 --> 38:09.405
We're in a gunfight over here."

38:09.409 --> 38:11.339
I'm like, "I don't know."

38:21.286 --> 38:23.516
I got the rest of my tattoo
colored in.

38:23.522 --> 38:24.952
- Did you really?

38:24.956 --> 38:26.956
Wow, I haven't.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.588
I need to get some more...

38:31.493 --> 38:34.362
<i>One of the big things
about combat</i>

38:34.363 --> 38:38.999
Is being able to
keep your emotion in check.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.070
A lot of people say that
we don't have emotions anymore.

38:42.071 --> 38:46.369
Well, maybe it's
because we're good

38:46.373 --> 38:49.308
At controlling our emotions

38:49.309 --> 38:53.909
And not letting our emotions
overtake everything else.

38:53.913 --> 38:55.713
- Because you suppressed
all those emotions

38:55.714 --> 38:57.548
So much and so long,

38:57.549 --> 38:59.879
You don't know what you're
supposed to be happy for

38:59.884 --> 39:02.684
Or sad for anymore.

39:02.686 --> 39:06.516
Zero emotions, across the board.

39:06.523 --> 39:08.390
I don't get overly happy.

39:08.391 --> 39:09.958
I don't get overly sad.

39:09.959 --> 39:12.959
I don't get overly excited.

39:12.962 --> 39:15.400
And it, you know,
becomes a big burden

39:15.401 --> 39:17.957
For the family, too, because
they don't know where I'm at.

39:17.966 --> 39:19.726
"Did I do a good thing, dad?"

39:19.734 --> 39:22.474
"of course, I love you,
way to go."

39:33.679 --> 39:35.509
- My name is bill Howell,
nice to meet you.

39:35.515 --> 39:37.515
Yeah, I worked with Jefferson.

39:37.517 --> 39:39.577
I'm a special forces guy.

39:39.585 --> 39:40.975
- Oh, you are?
- Yes, Ma'am.

39:40.986 --> 39:42.446
I worked with him there
in 5th group.

39:42.454 --> 39:43.724
Fix the bike,
put it back together,

39:43.725 --> 39:45.551
Get it running, yes, Sir.

39:56.732 --> 39:59.432
- That's it, right there.

39:59.435 --> 40:01.465
- Holy... look at that.

40:01.470 --> 40:03.370
September '02.

40:03.371 --> 40:06.571
<i>To be able to do this
for Jesse is awesome.</i>

40:06.574 --> 40:08.714
<i>- You know, he was man
that could walk in the room</i>

40:08.715 --> 40:10.376
And tell you how it is.

40:10.377 --> 40:11.937
That's the way the bike is;
It's loud.

40:11.945 --> 40:13.905
<i>You feel it, you know,
the engine was strong,</i>

40:13.913 --> 40:15.113
<i>Just like my father.</i>

40:15.114 --> 40:17.982
- Y'all want to try
to push it back?

40:17.983 --> 40:20.053
<i>- In my head, that emulates
everything my father was</i>

40:20.054 --> 40:21.781
<i>And what I missed about him.</i>

40:36.032 --> 40:38.000
- <i>I mean, there's no way</i>

40:38.001 --> 40:40.601
<i>That anyone could
ever replace his dad,</i>

40:40.603 --> 40:45.706
<i>But if each one of us
can give him a little something</i>

40:45.707 --> 40:47.767
<i>Of what J.D's not able to,</i>

40:47.775 --> 40:51.435
<i>Then I believe we're
doing our job as brothers.</i>

41:15.935 --> 41:21.005
<i>I would have never wanted
to be my wife.</i>

41:21.007 --> 41:23.937
<i>I wouldn't have wanted
to be one of my sons.</i>

41:23.943 --> 41:25.677
Back and forth, back and forth,

41:25.678 --> 41:27.008
<i>Not knowing
if you're gonna come home,</i>

41:27.012 --> 41:28.852
<i>Somebody else getting killed.</i>

41:28.853 --> 41:32.777
What kind of...
what kind of father was I?

41:32.784 --> 41:34.984
I was young.

41:34.986 --> 41:37.446
Very hard.

41:37.455 --> 41:38.915
Very mean.

41:43.159 --> 41:47.096
<i>It's the whole intimacy
of family,</i>

41:47.097 --> 41:51.767
<i>That I didn't have it
when I was a green beret,</i>

41:51.768 --> 41:53.768
<i>'cause I was a good green beret.</i>

41:58.906 --> 42:00.036
Did a lot of things wrong.

42:00.041 --> 42:02.541
Good lord.

42:02.543 --> 42:04.981
And if I could, I'd do
a lot of them different.

42:04.982 --> 42:08.248
<i>I'd sure be a better father
and a better husband.</i>

42:08.249 --> 42:10.577
You know, it's just...

42:10.582 --> 42:12.982
What can you do,

42:12.984 --> 42:15.884
But try to learn
and move forward, you know?

42:33.568 --> 42:36.237
- Is that dad?
- That's dad.

42:36.238 --> 42:38.238
- I just don't believe it.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.910
<i>- I remember when my dad
initially got his paperwork</i>

42:40.911 --> 42:44.039
<i>About how he's gonna be
the team sergeant of 574.</i>

42:44.045 --> 42:46.705
And that was honestly
my dad's biggest dream,

42:46.714 --> 42:48.084
<i>To be a team sergeant.</i>

42:48.085 --> 42:49.549
- Doing the tobacco.

42:49.550 --> 42:50.750
- Working the tobacco field.

42:50.751 --> 42:53.819
- Yes.

42:53.820 --> 42:56.020
That's a real scorpion
right there.

42:56.022 --> 42:59.891
- <i>He left, and then...</i>

42:59.892 --> 43:03.060
<i>It felt...</i>

43:03.061 --> 43:06.861
<i>Normal again in the sense
that that's what he did.</i>

43:06.864 --> 43:09.134
He would leave
and go do his work,

43:09.135 --> 43:11.800
<i>And we would all be here.</i>

43:11.801 --> 43:14.301
<i>Go to school.</i>

43:14.303 --> 43:18.606
<i>And then he would come back
in six or nine months.</i>

43:18.607 --> 43:22.537
<i>We would see him again.</i>

43:22.544 --> 43:26.246
- This is the first letter
I received from him.

43:26.247 --> 43:28.147
<i>"Hello, sweetheart.</i>

43:28.148 --> 43:31.648
<i>"today is the 31st of October.</i>

43:31.651 --> 43:38.721
"this has been hardest trip
for me.

43:38.724 --> 43:41.826
"I really didn't want to go.

43:41.827 --> 43:46.627
I just didn't want to leave
you and the kids."

43:46.631 --> 43:47.731
- I've never read it.

43:47.732 --> 43:49.832
- I kept it for you.

43:53.837 --> 43:55.737
- <i>His love for family</i>

43:55.739 --> 43:58.939
<i>Extended to how
he treated the team.</i>

43:58.942 --> 44:01.180
It was an extension
of his family.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.577
- <i>He was a good team sergeant.</i>

44:02.578 --> 44:03.908
<i>He was rather soft-spoken.</i>

44:03.912 --> 44:06.280
<i>He was like a big bear, until...</i>

44:06.281 --> 44:09.119
Until you pissed him off,
and he'd, you know...

44:09.120 --> 44:10.847
We didn't piss him off a lot.

44:13.086 --> 44:16.016
<i>- The anti-Taliban forces
appear to be closing in</i>

44:16.023 --> 44:19.258
<i>On the Taliban stronghold
of Kandahar.</i>

44:19.259 --> 44:22.828
<i>- Talks on Afghanistan's future
began this morning.</i>

44:22.829 --> 44:27.229
<i>- A 44-year-old Pashtun
Tribal Commander, Hamid Karzai.</i>

44:28.233 --> 44:30.667
- <i>After Tarin Kowt,</i>

44:30.668 --> 44:33.598
<i>There were all these
terrific indicators</i>

44:33.604 --> 44:37.106
That we had the Taliban scared.

44:37.107 --> 44:41.276
<i>- We'd go through a village
and not even fire a shot.</i>

44:41.277 --> 44:45.677
<i>These guys would
come out of the woodwork.</i>

44:45.681 --> 44:47.081
And you... you would be amped up.

44:47.082 --> 44:48.382
You'd be like, "wup, wup."

44:48.383 --> 44:52.219
You know, you're about
ready to shoot.

44:52.220 --> 44:54.220
<i>You know, they'd be like,
"ahh!"</i>

44:54.222 --> 44:55.889
You know, waving.

44:55.890 --> 44:57.790
<i>Once they could see
the force coming in,</i>

44:57.791 --> 44:59.191
<i>They were all about it.</i>

44:59.192 --> 45:00.722
<i>They wanted to be with you.</i>

45:00.726 --> 45:03.086
<i>They wanted
to get the Taliban out.</i>

45:03.095 --> 45:06.725
<i>- We were literally throwing as
in the back of SUVs,</i>

45:06.731 --> 45:09.399
<i>And just, you know,
stacks and piles.</i>

45:09.400 --> 45:10.930
<i>"hey, we got a couple more,
guys.</i>

45:10.934 --> 45:14.770
<i>Let's keep going."</i>

45:14.771 --> 45:19.071
<i>- We had this few hundred man
mob of afghan fighters,</i>

45:19.075 --> 45:21.775
<i>And we just had to move
this mob down to Kandahar.</i>

45:21.777 --> 45:23.077
- <i>That's when we coined the tem...</i>

45:23.078 --> 45:25.138
<i>"fucked up
like an afghan convoy."</i>

45:28.382 --> 45:30.420
<i>- I knew it was
completely unrealistic</i>

45:30.421 --> 45:32.117
When I went into special forces

45:32.118 --> 45:34.748
<i>That I'd be given
the kind of autonomy</i>

45:34.753 --> 45:37.153
<i>That, holy shit, here I have...</i>

45:37.155 --> 45:42.855
<i>It was exactly the campaign
I, you know, dreamed of.</i>

45:47.696 --> 45:48.956
- <i>Northern alliance commander..</i>

45:48.964 --> 45:50.364
<i>They have moved their troops</i>

45:50.365 --> 45:52.225
<i>Into areas close
to Mazar-e Sharif...</i>

45:52.233 --> 45:54.733
- <i>Fighting is intensifying.</i>

45:56.670 --> 46:00.139
<i>- We had greater maneuverability
on horseback in that terrain</i>

46:00.140 --> 46:02.210
<i>Than the Taliban
or Al-Qaeda did.</i>

46:06.145 --> 46:08.845
<i>They're in armored vehicles
and pickup trucks.</i>

46:08.847 --> 46:10.377
<i>They're tied
to their Fuel Depos.</i>

46:10.381 --> 46:12.281
<i>And so we were able
to cut them off</i>

46:12.282 --> 46:13.412
From reinforcement

46:13.416 --> 46:14.976
And cut them off from retreat.

46:20.754 --> 46:23.994
<i>I probably rode
300 miles or more.</i>

46:27.827 --> 46:31.927
<i>I was determined
I was gonna ride that horse</i>

46:31.932 --> 46:36.001
<i>All the way
into Mazar-e Sharif.</i>

46:36.002 --> 46:37.736
- <i>Crossed over the river.</i>

46:37.737 --> 46:39.197
The water was higher enough

46:39.205 --> 46:42.065
That the horses actually
started to float down the river.

46:42.074 --> 46:44.742
And, of course, we did not
want to go for a swim.

46:44.743 --> 46:46.343
<i>- Standing in the water,
very cold water,</i>

46:46.344 --> 46:47.911
<i>Water up to my waist.</i>

46:47.912 --> 46:50.280
<i>I just looked back,
looked south,</i>

46:50.281 --> 46:53.481
<i>And then I just realized,
it was...</i>

46:53.484 --> 46:57.094
<i>It was the most unbelievable
shot I'd ever seen.</i>

46:59.923 --> 47:05.927
<i>It was a thousand riders
on horseback.</i>

47:05.928 --> 47:11.328
<i>It was peaceful,
yet magnificent.</i>

47:11.333 --> 47:14.033
<i>- Mazar-e Sharif
has indeed been captured</i>

47:14.035 --> 47:15.895
<i>By the northern alliance.</i>

47:24.876 --> 47:27.206
<i>- They perceived us
as liberators.</i>

47:27.212 --> 47:29.312
<i>I didn't learn until later</i>

47:29.314 --> 47:32.883
<i>That they perceived my team,</i>

47:32.884 --> 47:36.386
<i>From the Uzbek Lore, as Malakas,</i>

47:36.387 --> 47:40.957
<i>Avenging angels
with swords of lightning.</i>

47:40.958 --> 47:42.558
- <i>The fall of the city</i>

47:42.560 --> 47:44.490
<i>Is the biggest blow
to the ruling Taliban</i>

47:44.495 --> 47:49.055
<i>Since the allied airstrikes
began 35 days ago.</i>

47:49.066 --> 47:50.366
- <i>That was the pinnacle</i>

47:50.367 --> 47:54.437
<i>Of what all sf soldiers
train for.</i>

48:19.627 --> 48:22.357
<i>- I graduated from the
university of Nevada Las Vegas</i>

48:22.364 --> 48:25.264
<i>With an accounting degree.</i>

48:25.266 --> 48:27.096
<i>Went to work
for an accounting firm</i>

48:27.101 --> 48:30.236
<i>And determined that
I did not like it at all.</i>

48:30.237 --> 48:32.167
<i>And I said, there's got
to be more to life</i>

48:32.172 --> 48:35.342
<i>Than balancing a checkbook.</i>

48:56.994 --> 48:59.463
Don Bolduc was the best officer
<i>in my battalion.</i>

48:59.464 --> 49:03.667
<i>He was also
my operations officer.</i>

49:03.668 --> 49:07.568
<i>- It was the opinion
of our senior leadership</i>

49:07.571 --> 49:09.271
<i>In the pentagon</i>

49:09.272 --> 49:12.240
<i>That they wanted
a lieutenant colonel,</i>

49:12.241 --> 49:14.371
<i>A more experienced officer,</i>

49:14.376 --> 49:16.976
<i>On the ground in Afghanistan.</i>

49:16.978 --> 49:20.578
<i>And so that's why we deployed.</i>

49:20.581 --> 49:23.281
<i>To me, it was...</i>

49:23.283 --> 49:26.318
It was exciting.

49:26.319 --> 49:28.488
<i>- I mean, one day I'll tell
my Grandkids about it</i>

49:28.489 --> 49:30.047
When I'm old and decrepit,

49:30.055 --> 49:32.145
And they'll go,
"oh, yeah, sure, grandpa."

49:35.558 --> 49:37.558
<i>- You know,
while left to our own devices,</i>

49:37.561 --> 49:41.061
<i>We felt like we were able
to get quite a lot done.</i>

49:41.064 --> 49:43.464
<i>It was almost the seeds
of our own destruction,</i>

49:43.466 --> 49:47.996
<i>Because everything went so well.</i>

49:48.003 --> 49:50.403
<i>Then we find out, you know,
a headquarters with 20 folks</i>

49:50.405 --> 49:52.435
Are going to come in.

49:56.209 --> 49:59.578
<i>- I remember celebrating
thanksgiving in Pakistan,</i>

49:59.579 --> 50:03.748
<i>And then we infilled
the next night.</i>

50:03.749 --> 50:06.679
- <i>Okay, they're moving in.</i>

50:06.685 --> 50:08.985
<i>- Well, once I got there,
I had a big meeting,</i>

50:08.987 --> 50:12.487
<i>You know, getting
coffee-breath close with them.</i>

50:12.490 --> 50:14.020
<i>And I explained it to them.</i>

50:14.024 --> 50:15.524
I said, "okay, here's the deal.

50:15.525 --> 50:17.185
<i>"This is the way
it's been organized.</i>

50:17.193 --> 50:19.162
<i>"this is the way
it's been directed.</i>

50:19.163 --> 50:22.101
<i>"and we're soldiers,
so let's salute the flagpole</i>

50:22.102 --> 50:25.397
And get beyond
the emotion of it.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.168
<i>- So the thing we had feared
when this higher command</i>

50:28.169 --> 50:29.539
Comes in and starts
giving us orders,

50:29.540 --> 50:31.197
We're gonna have to follow them.

50:31.205 --> 50:33.235
Well, higher command came in,
giving us orders,

50:33.240 --> 50:34.740
And now we have to follow them.

50:34.741 --> 50:39.411
<i>So somebody else
was now controlling the fight.</i>

50:39.412 --> 50:41.282
<i>- I meet Captain Amerine
for the very first time,</i>

50:41.283 --> 50:46.580
<i>Captain Amerine
and Master Sergeant Davis.</i>

50:46.584 --> 50:48.121
<i>I don't think they were...</i>

50:48.122 --> 50:49.748
I don't think
they were real happy.

51:02.429 --> 51:07.266
<i>- Oh, god, I hate it,
telling this story.</i>

51:07.267 --> 51:08.497
<i>It just sucks.</i>

51:08.501 --> 51:12.170
<i>Always sucks.</i>

51:12.171 --> 51:15.671
I've seen all the ways
that the truth can be twisted.

51:15.674 --> 51:17.114
<i>And...</i>

51:21.678 --> 51:25.108
<i>I couldn't let that happen.</i>

51:40.595 --> 51:43.695
- <i>How are you?</i>

51:43.699 --> 51:45.299
- I don't know.

51:50.503 --> 51:52.343
I don't know.

52:14.459 --> 52:18.499
<i>The morning of the 5th,
things were done.</i>

52:35.112 --> 52:37.447
<i>- 7:00, we started seeing
people, "oh, all right,"</i>

52:37.448 --> 52:39.208
You know, and then,
"hey, what's going on?"

52:39.216 --> 52:41.446
<i>And then the mail,
so we were reading mail</i>

52:41.451 --> 52:43.721
<i>And burning it
as soon as you read it.</i>

52:47.388 --> 52:48.718
- On the 5th of December,

52:48.723 --> 52:54.661
The targets were
predominantly in this area.

52:54.662 --> 52:56.229
We received intel

52:56.230 --> 52:59.260
From what we considered
a very reliable source

52:59.266 --> 53:01.566
On where the Taliban
and Al-Qaeda

53:01.568 --> 53:03.198
<i>That were still resisting us</i>

53:03.202 --> 53:05.542
<i>On the other side
of the bridge were.</i>

53:05.543 --> 53:07.367
<i>So I went to colonel fox.</i>

53:07.372 --> 53:10.142
<i>I said, "Sir, I would like
to start initiating</i>

53:10.143 --> 53:11.571
<i>"some close air support,</i>

53:11.575 --> 53:16.135
<i>Daytime close air support
in this area."</i>

53:16.146 --> 53:17.906
- <i>The hostilities were over.</i>

53:17.914 --> 53:20.284
<i>The Taliban were coming
to surrender.</i>

53:20.285 --> 53:21.883
<i>Why was the battalion
headquarters</i>

53:21.884 --> 53:24.224
<i>Calling in an air strike
to begin with?</i>

53:27.421 --> 53:30.590
<i>I mean, to me,
it was pretty obviously</i>

53:30.591 --> 53:35.427
<i>A way to say
that they'd engaged the enemy</i>

53:35.428 --> 53:38.258
Before the war ended.

53:38.264 --> 53:42.700
<i>- I don't know if the sun
hit it just right.</i>

53:42.701 --> 53:46.441
<i>But we observed the opening
of a cave.</i>

53:51.175 --> 53:53.375
<i>- Every air strike
that we directed</i>

53:53.378 --> 53:58.648
Was basically personally
authorized by me.

53:58.649 --> 54:02.749
I explained it
to fox and Bolduc.

54:02.753 --> 54:04.553
- You know, I'm a colonel;
He's a Captain.

54:04.554 --> 54:07.222
So both professional enough
to know,

54:07.223 --> 54:09.958
You know, I'm giving the orders.

54:09.959 --> 54:13.689
You execute...
you execute the orders.

54:13.696 --> 54:15.656
- <i>I was livid.</i>

54:15.664 --> 54:19.433
<i>Again, trying
to contain my anger.</i>

54:19.434 --> 54:23.403
<i>There was no valid target
to bomb there.</i>

54:23.404 --> 54:24.771
- He's a commander.

54:24.772 --> 54:26.472
I mean, he outranks you.

54:26.473 --> 54:28.673
He can do
whatever he wants, really.

54:28.675 --> 54:32.735
<i>Is it the most tactically
proper way of doing things?</i>

54:32.745 --> 54:36.345
<i>No, not with us being there.</i>

54:36.348 --> 54:38.916
- <i>We could have done nothing.</i>

54:38.917 --> 54:41.417
But nothing was...

54:41.419 --> 54:42.719
You know, I don't believe

54:42.720 --> 54:44.920
That was the proper
course of action.

54:44.922 --> 54:47.422
<i>We were just...
we were just trying</i>

54:47.424 --> 54:49.691
<i>To interdict them</i>

54:49.692 --> 54:51.592
<i>And drop enough ordinance
on them</i>

54:51.593 --> 54:53.460
<i>To make a statement</i>

54:53.461 --> 54:55.431
And, you know,
kind of ruin their day

54:55.432 --> 55:01.467
<i>And get them to dislodge
and go in retreat.</i>

55:01.468 --> 55:03.836
- <i>B-52s overhead.</i>

55:03.837 --> 55:05.597
<i>They look back at me and say,</i>

55:05.605 --> 55:09.965
<i>"are we cleared to drop
a 2,000-pound Jdam</i>

55:09.976 --> 55:11.436
On the cave opening?"

55:11.444 --> 55:15.447
I say yes.

55:15.448 --> 55:19.578
I, you know...

55:19.585 --> 55:23.815
I'd say it's something that
I'll take to my grave with me,

55:23.822 --> 55:26.792
As a, you know, should I have
done something different?

55:26.793 --> 55:27.861
Should I have done...

55:27.862 --> 55:29.358
Should I have...

55:29.359 --> 55:31.259
You know, should I have
just ignored this?

55:33.829 --> 55:37.798
<i>- When you call in an Airstrik,
you have to be hypersensitive</i>

55:37.799 --> 55:40.429
Of all the things
that could go wrong.

55:40.434 --> 55:43.674
<i>You're talking about
a 2,000-pound bomb.</i>

55:47.406 --> 55:50.406
- I would give everything back,

55:50.410 --> 55:52.780
All the promotions,
all the recognition,

55:52.781 --> 55:56.579
All the medals,
everything that I have,

55:56.582 --> 55:58.549
<i>Everything that I have,</i>

55:58.550 --> 56:01.620
<i>For none of this
to ever have happened.</i>

56:10.960 --> 56:12.560
- <i>All emotion and everything</i>

56:12.562 --> 56:15.462
<i>Just kind of shut off
for a little bit.</i>

56:15.464 --> 56:18.933
<i>And I remember this feeling.</i>

56:18.934 --> 56:24.338
<i>It was,
"fuck you, I'm not dead."</i>

56:24.339 --> 56:26.006
- <i>The next thing I know</i>

56:26.007 --> 56:30.737
Is that my head's
being driven into the dirt.

56:30.745 --> 56:32.745
- <i>Mag was blown apart over her.</i>

56:32.747 --> 56:35.407
You know, this was...
I didn't see anybody.

56:35.416 --> 56:37.676
I mean, you're focused
right here.

56:37.684 --> 56:42.054
<i>- And I had blood
and body parts,</i>

56:42.055 --> 56:44.885
You know, various...
all over my uniform.

56:44.891 --> 56:46.921
- And I'm just sitting there
looking at myself,

56:46.926 --> 56:51.626
And this thumb was touching
the inside of my arm here.

56:51.630 --> 56:53.897
I'm like, "oh, that's bad."

56:53.898 --> 56:56.568
As I arched, because I had
a big sucking chest wound,

56:56.569 --> 57:00.336
All this blood starts
blasting out of my shirt here.

57:00.337 --> 57:03.467
And I remember starting
to kind of go into shock,

57:03.473 --> 57:05.013
And I said, "oh, my god,"
three times.

57:05.014 --> 57:06.607
And so the last thing
I thought was,

57:06.608 --> 57:07.968
As I was looking at that, is,

57:07.976 --> 57:09.836
If I go face-down,
I'm gonna drown in this.

57:09.844 --> 57:11.411
So when I go out,

57:11.412 --> 57:13.481
I got to go
and turn my head this way.

57:13.482 --> 57:15.850
And that's the last thing
I remember, and I...

57:21.653 --> 57:23.093
<i>- You know,
there's really not a day</i>

57:23.094 --> 57:26.988
<i>I don't think
about that whole event.</i>

57:26.991 --> 57:34.430
<i>I mean, we never found enough
of Master Sergeant Davis.</i>

57:34.431 --> 57:36.031
<i>We had to do a DNA analysis,</i>

57:36.032 --> 57:39.672
<i>Because the bomb hit
exactly where he was standing.</i>

57:52.880 --> 57:55.580
<i>- Our company sergeant major
came in with the news</i>

57:55.583 --> 58:02.953
<i>That 574 had a Jdam
dropped on their position,</i>

58:02.956 --> 58:06.786
And said J.D And...

58:06.793 --> 58:07.793
- Dano.

58:07.794 --> 58:09.994
- Dano were K.I.A.

58:09.996 --> 58:13.096
And that was kind of
a devastating moment.

58:15.499 --> 58:20.469
<i>- The 574 casualties
hit me pretty hard.</i>

58:32.080 --> 58:33.850
Trying to figure out
what I want to...

58:33.851 --> 58:36.479
How I want to tell you this,
but...

58:39.085 --> 58:41.415
- These guys
on your left and right,

58:41.421 --> 58:44.921
And they will always be there,
no matter what.

58:49.861 --> 58:52.661
And, to me,
it's like brotherhood.

58:57.735 --> 58:59.195
Excuse me.

59:01.771 --> 59:05.441
<i>- I finally shut off
for a minute,</i>

59:05.442 --> 59:08.278
<i>And I just cried my eyes out.</i>

59:08.279 --> 59:13.179
The first Americans
killed in Afghanistan

59:13.183 --> 59:16.683
Were killed by their own people.

59:22.623 --> 59:24.963
<i>- Afghan fighters
have deserted the Taliban.</i>

59:24.964 --> 59:31.829
<i>- Soldiers are now
deserting in the hundreds.</i>

59:31.831 --> 59:37.101
- They surrendered Kandahar
that day.

59:37.102 --> 59:39.072
And... I just need a minute here.

01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:05.259
- <i>In four short months,</i>

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.596
Our nation has begun to rebuild
<i>new york and the pentagon,</i>

01:00:09.597 --> 01:00:11.257
<i>Rallied a great coalition...</i>

01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:16.065
<i>- I was down there below,
on the floor of congress,</i>

01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:20.099
<i>Listening to the president
give the "evil empire" speech,</i>

01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:23.636
<i>Which would end up being
a very defining speech</i>

01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:26.276
<i>For the next 14 years, really.</i>

01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:27.837
- <i>Terrorist training camps,</i>

01:00:27.845 --> 01:00:29.945
Saved a people from starvation,

01:00:29.947 --> 01:00:33.677
And freed a country
from brutal oppression.

01:00:33.684 --> 01:00:36.018
- What does victory feel like?

01:00:36.019 --> 01:00:39.788
<i>It felt like we had
done our jobs.</i>

01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:42.657
<i>I mean, as hindsight,
it was the perfect...</i>

01:00:42.658 --> 01:00:44.918
You know, it was the mission
that we'd trained for

01:00:44.926 --> 01:00:46.956
From the time
we came in special forces.

01:00:46.961 --> 01:00:48.628
That was the mission.

01:00:48.629 --> 01:00:50.129
- We had less than 100 guys.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:53.730
We topped the Taliban
and ran Al-Qaeda off.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:58.770
Add 20,000 troops,
been bogged down every since.

01:00:58.771 --> 01:01:03.271
<i>- I think we did
make it look too easy.</i>

01:01:03.275 --> 01:01:08.275
<i>But we didn't really have time
to reflect on that</i>

01:01:08.279 --> 01:01:11.409
<i>Before we were invading Iraq</i>

01:01:11.415 --> 01:01:14.345
<i>With the expectation
it would be over quickly.</i>

01:01:14.351 --> 01:01:16.951
<i>- What we have found
in Afghanistan confirms</i>

01:01:16.953 --> 01:01:19.087
<i>That, far from ending there,</i>

01:01:19.088 --> 01:01:22.988
<i>Our war against terror
is only beginning.</i>

01:01:28.661 --> 01:01:31.196
- <i>So when we chased Bin Laden</i>

01:01:31.197 --> 01:01:34.397
<i>Out of Afghanistan,
into Pakistan,</i>

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.667
<i>As far as the commander told us,</i>

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:37.668
<i>We have done our job.</i>

01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:40.999
<i>"great job."</i>

01:01:41.005 --> 01:01:45.865
<i>We all but tied the bow
on Afghanistan at the time.</i>

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:48.006
That same team,
that same group of guys

01:01:48.011 --> 01:01:49.980
Went to Iraq,
and less than 90 days,

01:01:49.981 --> 01:01:51.449
We thought Iraq was over too.

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:53.177
- Yeah.

01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:56.182
- We were having tea in Baghdad.

01:01:56.185 --> 01:01:57.675
- Literally.

01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:58.846
- Eating in a restaurant.

01:01:58.853 --> 01:01:59.853
- You're welcome.

01:01:59.854 --> 01:02:00.923
- You're welcome.

01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:02.421
Yeah, here's your country.

01:02:02.422 --> 01:02:05.192
- You know, nine months later,
you come home again,

01:02:05.193 --> 01:02:07.926
And you got a new mission.

01:02:07.927 --> 01:02:09.187
You used to go in a VFW,

01:02:09.194 --> 01:02:10.831
And you hear one guy
had one tour,

01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:12.258
And you're like, "oh, wow."

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:13.931
And you hear one guy
had two tours,

01:02:13.932 --> 01:02:15.760
You're like,
"ooh, he's a little crazy."

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:16.755
You know what I mean?

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.026
Somebody had three tours,

01:02:18.033 --> 01:02:19.933
You know they're
out of their minds.

01:02:19.934 --> 01:02:21.200
- Yeah.

01:02:21.201 --> 01:02:22.931
- And what you see now is,
you know,

01:02:22.936 --> 01:02:29.066
People have five, seven,
nine, ten tours,

01:02:29.074 --> 01:02:32.309
And they're still going.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.810
- Me and Scotty...

01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.479
Scotty and I retired
the same year.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.880
And when I retired,

01:02:37.881 --> 01:02:42.481
I just went home and...

01:02:42.485 --> 01:02:44.845
And I'm gonna tell you this.

01:02:44.854 --> 01:02:48.990
11 days after I retired,
I put my wife in the hospital.

01:02:48.991 --> 01:02:50.021
I don't even know why.

01:02:50.025 --> 01:02:51.355
I just kind of freaked out.

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:52.859
I'm not saying it's PTSD.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.127
I'm not saying it was anything.

01:02:55.128 --> 01:02:58.828
I don't even really
remember what happened.

01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:01.766
It's just... it's just like,

01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:03.327
You know, you go,
and you do things,

01:03:03.335 --> 01:03:09.365
And you do some, really,
stuff that's crazy.

01:03:09.374 --> 01:03:11.274
And then, when you're done,

01:03:11.275 --> 01:03:16.175
They just tell you, "bye."

01:03:16.179 --> 01:03:17.309
You know?

01:03:25.987 --> 01:03:28.317
<i>- I just came back
from Afghanistan again,</i>

01:03:28.323 --> 01:03:33.060
<i>Another deployment over there.</i>

01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:38.197
<i>This was my 26th
deployment total.</i>

01:03:38.198 --> 01:03:40.458
I forgot to give him
some stuff last night.

01:03:40.466 --> 01:03:41.826
- I'm just filling him.

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:44.936
<i>How long have I known Mark?</i>

01:03:44.937 --> 01:03:46.967
For as long as I can remember.

01:03:46.972 --> 01:03:51.772
Probably since 3 or 4.

01:03:51.776 --> 01:03:54.936
So I've known him
for a long time.

01:03:54.945 --> 01:03:57.845
I usually know
what he's thinking,

01:03:57.847 --> 01:04:00.977
And sometimes he does me.

01:04:00.983 --> 01:04:01.983
- I know.

01:04:01.984 --> 01:04:03.984
- Yeah, but...

01:04:03.986 --> 01:04:08.316
- Amy's, you know,
raised our family,

01:04:08.323 --> 01:04:10.393
You know,
being a single working mom

01:04:10.394 --> 01:04:13.426
Majority of the year.

01:04:13.427 --> 01:04:15.357
- I've had some
trying times at home,

01:04:15.362 --> 01:04:17.362
But I manage to get through it,

01:04:17.364 --> 01:04:19.234
And then I yell at him
for it later,

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:22.300
Going, "this is what
I had to deal with."

01:04:22.301 --> 01:04:25.369
- It's just adapting,

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:31.207
Continuing to evolve
and adapt to that new normal.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:32.968
Maybe that's part of it,

01:04:32.976 --> 01:04:36.176
Is, you keep turning up the heat
a couple degrees at a time

01:04:36.179 --> 01:04:38.146
Over 26 deployments,

01:04:38.147 --> 01:04:42.877
And then you're kind of
at that new normal.

01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:44.854
My tolerance level for bullshit

01:04:44.855 --> 01:04:49.521
Is kind of at its max.

01:04:49.522 --> 01:04:56.227
And, you know, I...

01:04:56.228 --> 01:04:57.888
I'd say that's maybe one thing,

01:04:57.896 --> 01:05:01.456
Just lose some patience
with myself

01:05:01.466 --> 01:05:06.026
Or my family, or...

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.969
<i>- When he comes home
from deployments,</i>

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:15.210
We try to bring everybody here
to just be a family,

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.011
<i>Hang out outside.</i>

01:05:17.012 --> 01:05:18.579
- Is that good?

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.180
- <i>But, yeah, 14 years.</i>

01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:25.952
<i>Kaya was born
when he was in Afghanistan.</i>

01:05:25.953 --> 01:05:28.587
<i>She's almost 14.</i>

01:05:28.588 --> 01:05:31.288
- Wait, wait...

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.020
Now.

01:05:37.561 --> 01:05:41.361
<i>- I keep going back
because I want to believe</i>

01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:43.895
<i>That we made a difference.</i>

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:46.169
<i>You know, the ranger creed
they instill in us</i>

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:48.198
Is, you know,
"readily will I display

01:05:48.203 --> 01:05:53.006
"the intestinal fortitude
to carry on to the objective.

01:05:53.007 --> 01:05:55.607
Though I be the lone survivor,
I keep going back."

01:06:10.322 --> 01:06:11.660
- <i>I remember that morning.</i>

01:06:11.661 --> 01:06:13.617
<i>It was like 2:00
in the morning.</i>

01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:16.325
<i>I happened to be just up.</i>

01:06:16.327 --> 01:06:18.127
<i>And I see it on CNN.</i>

01:06:18.128 --> 01:06:21.997
<i>It goes, two special forces
soldiers got killed.</i>

01:06:21.998 --> 01:06:23.598
<i>And I'm just thinking,</i>

01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:25.299
"oh, god.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.530
I hope they're nobody
that I know."

01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:36.171
- I was 13.

01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:38.235
<i>Yeah, I was at school.</i>

01:06:38.243 --> 01:06:40.943
<i>They called my name
for dismissal,</i>

01:06:40.945 --> 01:06:44.375
<i>To come to the office
to be dismissed.</i>

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:47.649
<i>And I went,
and the person picking me up</i>

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:52.387
Was someone who I never thought
<i>would be picking me up.</i>

01:06:52.388 --> 01:06:55.058
<i>And we got in the car,
and we were driving home.</i>

01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:58.387
<i>I said, "well, why are you
picking me up?"</i>

01:06:58.393 --> 01:07:00.563
<i>And he said, "well, your mom
just wanted me to come get you,</i>

01:07:00.564 --> 01:07:01.991
<i>Pick you up early."</i>

01:07:01.995 --> 01:07:06.295
And I remember saying out loud
to him,

01:07:06.299 --> 01:07:08.399
"maybe my dad came home."

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:13.598
I said, "maybe my dad's
coming home today."

01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:28.250
- <i>I walked in the door,</i>

01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:31.292
<i>And that's when I saw
the chaplain standing there.</i>

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:40.025
I actually saw
my mom and my sister crying.

01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:42.329
<i>The next day, when they said
that they dropped a bomb</i>

01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:44.731
<i>And it hit him,</i>

01:07:44.733 --> 01:07:47.103
I was angry.

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:54.540
<i>I actually hated the military
for a little while,</i>

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.471
But I had to act like I didn't.

01:08:02.514 --> 01:08:06.684
- <i>How many soldiers die?</i>

01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:08.375
And what is it for?

01:08:08.386 --> 01:08:10.216
What is it for?

01:08:10.221 --> 01:08:11.621
Okay, it's for our country.

01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:15.292
But what is it for?

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:48.419
<i>- Hey, this is a little
special rum from Guatemala</i>

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.823
That was introduced to me
by a good friend.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:54.486
His team worked
in Guatemala for like a year,

01:08:54.496 --> 01:08:58.626
Doing a fid mission,
and kicked ass.

01:08:58.633 --> 01:08:59.832
So...

01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:02.203
- All right,
one for the brotherhood.

01:09:02.205 --> 01:09:03.569
One for the legion.

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:06.441
- One for the legion.
- The legion, brothers.

01:09:22.453 --> 01:09:23.587
- <i>Hello, Cuz.</i>

01:09:23.589 --> 01:09:24.719
You doing all right?

01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:26.223
Good to see you.

01:09:26.224 --> 01:09:27.261
Good to see you.

01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:28.558
Mikyong, how are you?

01:09:28.559 --> 01:09:29.689
Good to see you.

01:09:29.693 --> 01:09:30.832
What you think, man?

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.357
- Yeah.

01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:33.791
She's here, man,
that's the main thing.

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:34.785
She's here.

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.196
- Dude, it's...

01:09:36.197 --> 01:09:38.327
- Are you excited?
- Very, very.

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:40.202
- Program's clean.

01:09:43.234 --> 01:09:44.465
What do y'all think, man?

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:45.600
- I'm ready to start it.

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:46.837
- Give it a try?

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:48.198
- Just make sure it's
in neutral.

01:09:48.206 --> 01:09:50.166
Turn the key on.

01:09:50.174 --> 01:09:51.844
Let her rip.

01:09:56.644 --> 01:09:58.746
- Yeah, it's in neutral.

01:09:58.747 --> 01:10:00.407
Hey, you want to sit on it?

01:10:00.415 --> 01:10:02.345
- Jesse, why don't you
sit on it?

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:04.450
That way, you can balance it,
'cause it's not on the stand.

01:10:04.452 --> 01:10:05.819
There you go.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.360
Pop the thrust, get some fuel
in that bad boy.

01:10:16.929 --> 01:10:18.297
Yeah!

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:21.528
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:10:23.536 --> 01:10:25.266
- All right!

01:10:25.271 --> 01:10:26.641
Whoo!

01:10:30.742 --> 01:10:32.342
- <i>Just hearing the bike,</i>

01:10:32.344 --> 01:10:34.244
<i>It was almost
hearing my dad again.</i>

01:10:34.245 --> 01:10:35.475
<i>Like, "I'm here."</i>

01:10:35.479 --> 01:10:37.609
<i>Like, "I'm right here."</i>

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:11.850
<i>- There are just certain spots
around the world</i>

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:15.277
<i>Where I feel like I can
just kind of get lost,</i>

01:11:15.283 --> 01:11:18.853
<i>You know, just being
able to disappear.</i>

01:11:24.992 --> 01:11:29.328
<i>Every soldier
I ever led in action</i>

01:11:29.329 --> 01:11:34.666
<i>Was wounded or killed.</i>

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:36.427
<i>What does that say about me?</i>

01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:38.735
<i>What does it say
about my abilities as a leader?</i>

01:11:38.737 --> 01:11:41.497
<i>What does it say
about me as a soldier?</i>

01:11:48.746 --> 01:11:50.706
Everybody was off the hill,

01:11:50.714 --> 01:11:54.583
And I walked back up on the hill
to where I knew J.D Had been,

01:11:54.584 --> 01:11:59.287
And I just started
kind of doing a loop,

01:11:59.288 --> 01:12:04.458
<i>Looking for anything I could.</i>

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:06.026
<i>I looked.</i>

01:12:06.027 --> 01:12:08.587
I couldn't find anything.

01:12:08.596 --> 01:12:09.796
It...

01:12:15.301 --> 01:12:18.971
<i>All that could come
to mind for me was this poem,</i>

01:12:18.972 --> 01:12:21.406
"futility" by Wilfred Owen.

01:12:21.407 --> 01:12:23.967
There was all this...

01:12:23.976 --> 01:12:33.576
There was this pervasive naivety
about what modern war was about.

01:12:33.584 --> 01:12:38.620
And then, the trenches of Europe

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.351
Wiped out a generation.

01:12:44.792 --> 01:12:51.998
<i>"Move him into the sun.</i>

01:12:51.999 --> 01:12:56.499
<i>"gently its touch
awoke him once,</i>

01:12:56.503 --> 01:13:04.342
<i>"at home, whispering
of fields un-sown.</i>

01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:09.013
<i>"always it woke him,
even in France,</i>

01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:14.018
<i>"until this morning
and this snow.</i>

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:15.889
<i>"If anything might rouse him now</i>

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:21.357
<i>"the kind old sun will know.</i>

01:13:21.358 --> 01:13:26.858
"think how it wakes the seeds...

01:13:26.863 --> 01:13:31.999
<i>"woke once the seeds
of a cold star.</i>

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.530
<i>"are limbs, so dear-achieved,
sides</i>

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:43.466
"full-nerved, too hard to stir?

01:13:43.476 --> 01:13:48.946
<i>"Was it for this
the clay grew tall?</i>

01:13:48.947 --> 01:13:51.877
<i>"o what made fatuous
sunbeams toil</i>

01:13:51.883 --> 01:13:54.583
<i>"to break earth's sleep at all?</i>

01:14:36.858 --> 01:14:38.158
Here's another one.

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:46.000
I'm gonna slide next to you.

01:15:21.166 --> 01:15:24.496
<i>- You know, what's amazing to e
is, we're not dead.</i>

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:28.197
Because they don't put
things out like this

01:15:28.206 --> 01:15:30.206
Unless you're dead.

01:15:31.942 --> 01:15:33.812
<i>- Well, there's a difference
between a monument</i>

01:15:33.813 --> 01:15:37.180
<i>That's why it's a monument,
and not a memorial.</i>

01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:39.181
- <i>Exactly.</i>
