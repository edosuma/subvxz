01:05.282 --> 01:07.699
Salt Lake Power's ruled out
any possibility of a gas leak.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.117
What do they think? Somebody
turned water into 200-proof gin?

01:10.193 --> 01:12.074
They dont know.
They've turned it over to ATF.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.143
They dont have a clue what's going on.
How far from Greenway lab is this pool?

01:15.220 --> 01:16.832
- About 4 kilometres.
- Anybody hurt?

01:16.909 --> 01:19.902
- No. Everyone was fine.
- Tell ATF if they want to be helpful,

01:19.978 --> 01:22.703
they can send us soil samples
from an 8km radius of the lab.

01:22.780 --> 01:25.044
You think 11234
could travel that far from lab ?

01:25.120 --> 01:27.193
Dust in the wind, Wes. You tell me.

01:28.229 --> 01:30.032
I'll ask for a 10k radius.

01:36.632 --> 01:38.397
What happened to all the bottled water?

01:38.474 --> 01:39.856
You can have mine.

01:40.316 --> 01:42.004
- Are you feeling dehydred?
- Yes.

01:42.081 --> 01:44.729
You think the cyanobacteria is turnin
our fluids into hydrogen gas?

01:44.844 --> 01:46.379
Fuck what? No!

01:46.456 --> 01:48.490
You don't think
that's what happened to scientists?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.178
We dont know what
happened to scientists.

01:50.255 --> 01:52.058
Yes we do. They combusted.

01:52.135 --> 01:54.130
Cyanobacteria needs a power source.

01:54.207 --> 01:56.471
It needs energy in order to
turn water into hydrogen gas.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.735
There's no ball of
sunshine inside of us.

01:58.927 --> 02:00.692
Well, maybe we have something else.

02:00.922 --> 02:03.186
Something that was in the air.
In the dust.

02:05.757 --> 02:08.252
Something we touched or breathed in.

02:08.597 --> 02:10.324
Power source in the dust.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.199
- What?
- Dust in the wind. Shit!

03:01.628 --> 03:02.588
What?

03:04.315 --> 03:05.965
Yeah, I'll be right down.

03:16.824 --> 03:17.783
Fuck!

03:20.930 --> 03:22.964
- Who else has it?
- Agent Hicks.

03:23.348 --> 03:25.458
- 4 other ATF agents.
- Bob?

03:25.765 --> 03:27.377
Everyone who was on site.

03:28.758 --> 03:30.677
We found 1123-4 cyanobacteria

03:30.754 --> 03:33.785
but what we don't know is what
the hell's keeping it alive.

03:34.169 --> 03:35.780
There's no sunshine in your body, David.

03:35.857 --> 03:37.430
But there a ray of hope in my head

03:37.507 --> 03:39.541
- 'cause I found something.
- What?

03:40.040 --> 03:42.265
The fuse to the time bomb, I think.

05:12.874 --> 05:14.064
<i>Geobacters.</i>

05:14.486 --> 05:17.134
All the sunshine cyanobacteria needs.

05:17.863 --> 05:20.088
- What are we talking about?
- Geological bacterium.

05:20.165 --> 05:23.158
- It's around since beginning of time.
- These things can live anywhere.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.883
Under the Antarctic ice.
Top of Mount Everest.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.837
Even deep in the dust
around a secret Utah lab.

05:29.260 --> 05:32.790
Now get this. Recent discoveries suggest
that when these little guys eat,

05:33.174 --> 05:35.438
they give off a minute
electrical charge.

05:35.514 --> 05:37.548
And this has been documented?

05:38.277 --> 05:41.884
Derek Lovley, UMass Amherst.
Take one, pass them around.

05:42.498 --> 05:44.455
So it's a living fuel cell.

05:47.602 --> 05:48.945
All the energy...

05:50.058 --> 05:53.051
that 1123-4 needs

05:53.550 --> 05:55.545
to survive inside the human body

05:56.658 --> 05:58.039
and work its magic.

06:00.495 --> 06:02.145
Energy in a black hole.

06:02.414 --> 06:03.642
<i>Geobacter.</i>

06:05.791 --> 06:07.517
Here's what I'm thinking.

06:07.748 --> 06:10.088
These things are everywhere
out in the world, right?

06:10.165 --> 06:11.508
Usually they're way deep down.

06:11.585 --> 06:14.693
So somehow, the ones in Utah
got stirred up to the surface.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.573
Now you've got your power source, right?

06:16.650 --> 06:18.953
Like a match ready to strike.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.255
Somehow someone
came in contact with them

06:21.332 --> 06:23.097
and unknowingly brought them
into the lab.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.936
So the lab is contaminated
with <i>Geobacter</i>.

06:26.013 --> 06:28.738
The scientists would've never realized
they were even carrying them.

06:28.814 --> 06:31.692
And then along the way while
they were working with 1123-4...

06:33.726 --> 06:37.180
they somehow came in contact with it
as well, accidentally ingested it.

06:39.559 --> 06:41.631
See they're working
with a controlled bacteria.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.394
They know that it can't
survive without sunlight

06:44.471 --> 06:49.114
or an energy source so they relax,
they fuck any biohazard worries

06:49.190 --> 06:51.570
- and they basically fuck themselves.
- So what happened?

06:51.646 --> 06:54.217
1123-4 and <i>Geobacters</i>
are inside of them.

06:54.294 --> 06:58.899
1123-4 can generate hydrogen gas
from the water in our bodies.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.854
<i>Geobacters</i> provide the energy source.

07:02.045 --> 07:04.578
Somehow they ignite.

07:05.230 --> 07:06.650
But they need a spark,

07:06.727 --> 07:10.679
a Bunsen burner, maybe a cigarette.
The lab explodes.

07:13.864 --> 07:16.819
1123-4 escapes
in one giant sneeze all over the desert.

07:17.702 --> 07:20.042
A nano mistake with global consequences.

07:20.503 --> 07:23.880
So how do these <i>Geobacters</i>
and cyanobacteria come together?

07:23.995 --> 07:26.144
They have a syntrophic relationship.

07:26.796 --> 07:28.177
Can't live without each other.

07:28.446 --> 07:31.746
The <i>Geobacter</i> can't survive
with a lot of oxygen.

07:32.322 --> 07:36.811
Cyanobacteria eats oxygen creating
an O2-less bubble around them

07:37.502 --> 07:41.224
with an increase of hydrogen, right?
Cyanobacteria needs energy to live.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.488
<i>Geobacter</i> makes plenty of it.

07:45.138 --> 07:47.940
They basically attract
each other like flies and shit.

07:48.477 --> 07:49.935
I'm gonna call the ATF,

07:50.012 --> 07:52.084
I'll get them
to put up a quarantine around the lab.

07:52.276 --> 07:55.998
No-go zone, 10k perimeter and
we need to get the soil samples, okay?

07:56.266 --> 07:58.147
If we can't contain this thing...

07:59.144 --> 08:01.754
Let's just find out how much
trouble we're in Wes, okay?

08:01.946 --> 08:02.943
Got it.

08:06.282 --> 08:07.625
What is it, Bob?

08:08.814 --> 08:11.309
If the <i>Geobacters</i>
are inside the dust in Utah,

08:12.230 --> 08:13.880
that means that they're in you and me.

08:13.956 --> 08:17.141
Very likely. You wanna take
the rest of the day off and dwell on it?

08:20.480 --> 08:23.089
- I'll prep the soil samples.
- Thank you.

08:27.617 --> 08:30.380
- What?!
- Real sensitive, Sandstrom.

08:30.649 --> 08:34.601
Fuck Mayko, they're probably
all through my guts too, okay?

08:36.212 --> 08:37.671
Look, it's really simple, okay?

08:37.748 --> 08:40.702
We just need to break the chain.
We kill either one of these bugs

08:40.779 --> 08:43.350
and the hydrogen gas
production inside us stops!

08:44.578 --> 08:46.113
What about out there?

08:49.298 --> 08:52.406
If we can't figure out a way to kill
this thing then we're all fucked!

09:04.110 --> 09:06.566
I think we need to get
David and Bob to a hospital.

09:06.758 --> 09:08.791
It's a good idea but David won't go.

09:09.252 --> 09:12.859
He's so stressed out. You know
this thing about his dad, right?

09:12.936 --> 09:15.545
- Of course.
- Apparently he's really getting to him.

09:16.044 --> 09:17.233
What did he say?

09:17.310 --> 09:20.418
Something about how his father
won't stop pushing his buttons.

09:35.537 --> 09:36.497
- David.
- What!

09:36.573 --> 09:38.569
Do you want to talk
to the money behind Greenway?

09:38.646 --> 09:41.178
Titus Muyerbridge represents
Auflander Docheimer industries.

09:41.255 --> 09:43.634
That's the company that underwrites
the science at Greenway.

09:43.711 --> 09:44.670
Yeah.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.812
- Mr. Muyerbridge?
- I'm here.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.347
I have David Sandstrom for you.

09:51.961 --> 09:53.803
Hello, Dr. Sandstrom.
Thanks for all your help.

09:53.880 --> 09:54.992
Who are you guys?

09:55.491 --> 09:59.444
ADI is a diversified global
opportunities venture capital fund.

09:59.789 --> 10:03.051
We specialize in energy,
environment and nanotechnology.

10:03.128 --> 10:05.583
Impressive. Why'd it
take so long to find you?

10:05.699 --> 10:07.694
<i>We're passive investors,
not hands-on operators.</i>

10:07.771 --> 10:10.303
You get to stand well back when
the shit hits the fan, is that it?

10:12.184 --> 10:14.831
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about 6 dead scientists.

10:14.908 --> 10:17.594
I'm talking about
6 ill-equipped, ill-prepared kids.

10:17.671 --> 10:20.472
They were extremely
talented PHDs in their field.

10:20.549 --> 10:22.813
I guess they've blinded
by money at the end of the tunnel

10:22.890 --> 10:25.269
because they cut corners
and released a doomsday nanobug.

10:25.346 --> 10:27.226
I can see you have a flair
for the dramatic.

10:27.303 --> 10:28.684
<i>Auchtung, you're not listening.</i>

10:28.761 --> 10:31.025
How much money are you throwing
at the scientific community?

10:31.101 --> 10:33.711
How many other slipshod labs
are you financing out there?

10:33.826 --> 10:37.893
Auflander Docheimer is investing close
to a billion dollars in 12 countries.

10:38.354 --> 10:40.234
<i>37 different projects. Look...</i>

10:40.349 --> 10:41.731
We respect our scientists.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.031
- We don't over and micromanage.
- Or impose safeguards?

10:45.146 --> 10:46.604
Invest in appropriate containment?

10:46.681 --> 10:49.137
- Insist on peer oversight, review?
- You're being inflammatory.

10:49.214 --> 10:51.362
I'm being realistic!
You cant just go throwing your money

10:51.439 --> 10:53.204
out there without
a clue of what you're doing!

10:53.281 --> 10:56.389
Science isn't a goddamn light bulb
glowing in the dark, anymore.

10:56.466 --> 10:59.497
We're able to play with the
fundamental rocks of existence.

10:59.574 --> 11:02.567
Rocks that can crumble with
the mistake the size of an atom!

11:02.644 --> 11:04.831
We try to look at it
much more optimistically.

11:04.908 --> 11:07.940
The only difference between you and
a jackass is the way atoms are arranged!

11:10.664 --> 11:13.887
<i>It's a pleasure talking you both.
Good luck with your... investigation.</i>

11:15.269 --> 11:16.996
One final word of caution.

11:17.418 --> 11:21.025
Everything that was taken from the lab
is legally the property of ADI.

11:21.101 --> 11:22.061
Fuck you Titus!

11:22.138 --> 11:23.941
You're wearing a big
soggy diaper full of shit

11:24.018 --> 11:26.320
and I am gonna pull
your pants down on the 6:00 news.

11:26.397 --> 11:27.510
Watch for it!

11:32.460 --> 11:33.573
Get back to work!

13:12.613 --> 13:14.033
I'm out here.

13:38.323 --> 13:40.165
I figured you'd be gone by now.

13:40.434 --> 13:42.276
Well, you figured wrong.

13:42.506 --> 13:44.693
I'm not leaving until we work this out.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.034
You keep me here for a reason, David.

13:47.418 --> 13:49.375
- Yeah?
- Yes, you do.

13:50.181 --> 13:53.135
You keep me here to remind
you of an uncomfortable truth.

13:53.557 --> 13:55.514
- Really, Dad?
- Yeah, really.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.006
The explosion in your lab.

13:59.966 --> 14:02.920
You never really got
to the bottom of it. Why?

14:05.952 --> 14:09.329
Because bureaucrats
in Washington fucked me over, Dad.

14:10.173 --> 14:11.324
Fuck 'em back!

14:11.669 --> 14:14.164
Can we just drop this?
We've been over it a 100 times.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.775
Then why won't you just say

14:16.389 --> 14:18.461
"Goodbye, Dad. Have a nice trip."

14:20.534 --> 14:22.951
Why do you make it
so hard for me to leave?

14:24.371 --> 14:25.407
Because.

14:29.705 --> 14:32.813
Say, you want to take a little walk,
go down to the café?

14:32.890 --> 14:35.384
Watch the pretty girls go by?
Drink a beer?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.072
I'm tired.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.643
Yeah, well, of course you are.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.329
It's been a rough
6 months for you, hasn't it?

14:42.406 --> 14:44.210
Dealing with all this crap?

14:45.322 --> 14:47.625
Saving my mind with prion injections,

14:48.661 --> 14:51.884
the lab exploding,
all your friends dying.

14:52.038 --> 14:53.649
I'm just tired, Dad!

15:11.800 --> 15:14.793
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Did you sleep here last night?

15:15.867 --> 15:18.131
I said tell me something I don't know.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.427
I retested the throat swab.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.689
And you found the <i>Geobacter</i>.
Carlos, something i don't know.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.068
I compared the first sample
to a new one.

15:29.567 --> 15:33.020
Yesterday the counts were
200 cells per milliliter, today, 340.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.613
Hang on a second.

15:48.408 --> 15:49.751
Hang on, hang on.

15:50.902 --> 15:52.168
How many hours ago?

15:52.590 --> 15:55.276
14. I think that you and Bob
should be in a hospital.

15:55.353 --> 15:57.732
Fuck that shit. So that's 12% per hour.

15:57.809 --> 16:00.265
7. You need to be somewhere
where we can monitor you hourly.

16:00.342 --> 16:03.028
I don't need monitoring.
I need to know when we're gonna pop!

16:03.949 --> 16:06.980
There're many variables. It depends how
much 1123 you were contaminated with,

16:07.057 --> 16:10.319
how quickly it's replicating.
I don't know, okay!

16:10.434 --> 16:12.621
This is why a hospital
is the best place for you to go.

16:12.698 --> 16:14.348
How much time do we have?!

16:16.612 --> 16:19.068
I'm working on a formula,
David. But it's hard, I'm worried.

16:20.142 --> 16:22.790
Then don't drink water Bob
and don't smoke cigars!

16:23.864 --> 16:25.054
What about static electricity?

16:25.553 --> 16:26.781
What about light switches?

16:26.857 --> 16:29.505
Somebody on the street lighting
a cigarette, candles at restaurant.

16:29.582 --> 16:32.306
Fine! If you're that worried about it,
check yourself into a hospital!

16:32.383 --> 16:35.338
The rest of us
will figure this out without you!

16:39.866 --> 16:43.550
I analyzed the soil samples
in and around the Greenway lab.

16:46.044 --> 16:47.540
Please don't worry, David.

16:48.346 --> 16:52.030
I found <i>Geobacters</i>
in all the samples and 1123-4.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.946
Right out to the edge of the
evacuation zone around the lab.

16:56.865 --> 16:59.398
- Bob. About before.
- What?

17:01.048 --> 17:02.007
I'm fine.

17:03.158 --> 17:05.806
We still have a chance
to contain it though.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.377
I was thinking of some kind of foam but

17:08.454 --> 17:10.219
it can't be petroleum or water based.

17:10.296 --> 17:14.133
<i>Geobacters</i> thrive in that.
Maybe a neutral powder.

17:14.248 --> 17:16.589
Okay so 7% per hour.

17:16.665 --> 17:20.003
- Maybe a tarp. Or plastic.
- 7% per hour.

17:20.310 --> 17:21.884
That'd be a lot of plastic.

17:22.997 --> 17:24.608
Still need a spark.

17:25.837 --> 17:28.253
Here's what we need to do.
We need to inject this in mice

17:28.330 --> 17:30.633
- and compare the timeline.
- I've already done that...

17:30.710 --> 17:32.398
Where are the results?!

17:32.782 --> 17:36.236
For fuck sakes.
I'll go do it again myself!

17:38.615 --> 17:39.766
Come on.

17:43.488 --> 17:44.678
Come on.

17:47.709 --> 17:49.436
- There you go.
- David.

17:49.551 --> 17:52.621
Stay away from me,
I'm a fucking time bomb. Tick-tick-tick.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.614
Don't disappear into this, okay.
We need you.

17:55.691 --> 17:57.610
Tick-tick-tick, Carlos.

17:58.837 --> 18:01.447
Let me take you home.
You can sleep a little bit...

18:01.524 --> 18:03.672
You want me to take a swing at you?!

18:04.939 --> 18:06.243
No, you don't wanna do that.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.081
Leave me the fuck alone and let me see
how long it takes for this mouse to fry.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.446
There you go.

18:18.523 --> 18:19.520
That's it.

18:27.387 --> 18:28.346
You okay?

18:29.689 --> 18:31.416
Sorry, I didn't see you.

18:32.337 --> 18:34.025
Got a lot on your mind?

18:36.174 --> 18:37.172
Yeah.

18:41.124 --> 18:43.120
How about you, Mayko? How're you doing?

18:45.422 --> 18:47.571
He's such an asshole, Carlos.

18:49.605 --> 18:50.718
He's scared, Mayko.

18:52.061 --> 18:54.363
When David's scared,
that's all he knows how to do.

18:54.517 --> 18:55.668
Just be an asshole?

19:01.731 --> 19:03.880
It's been a long, long journey.

19:07.794 --> 19:08.753
Yeah.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.669
Really long.

19:24.409 --> 19:25.637
Who's there?

19:30.434 --> 19:33.887
- These are nice.
- Don't thank me. They're from Carlos.

19:36.727 --> 19:38.991
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.174
How was the funeral?

19:45.169 --> 19:47.126
- I got drunk.
- Oh God.

19:47.203 --> 19:48.699
Then I hit Wes.

19:50.119 --> 19:51.731
And then I got drunker.

19:53.074 --> 19:56.144
Well, did you at least put
a Cala Lily on her grave for me?

19:56.220 --> 19:57.218
Course I did.

19:57.295 --> 19:59.597
- Good.
- Does it make you feel better?

20:00.365 --> 20:01.631
She liked Cala Lilies.

20:04.164 --> 20:06.619
Well, just so you know I like sunflowers
Just so you Know.

20:07.157 --> 20:08.385
Careful, Sandstrom,

20:08.461 --> 20:11.953
your time's gonna come
and oh boy them gods of fate

20:12.030 --> 20:15.023
- are gonna get you good.
- Them gods of fate?

20:15.100 --> 20:17.978
Listen, if there are gods of fate
and they ever have to contend with me,

20:18.055 --> 20:21.508
- they'll be shaking in their boots.
- Shaking with glee.

20:24.770 --> 20:25.959
Shaking...

20:27.725 --> 20:29.106
with glee.

20:40.618 --> 20:43.304
- What is it?
- <i>Aeromonas virus</i> 31.

20:43.381 --> 20:44.685
And it destroys cyanobacterium?

20:44.801 --> 20:47.448
Look what the virus did to
the cyano cell in less than 20 minutes.

20:48.983 --> 20:51.401
Gone.
And it didn't harm any other cells?

20:51.900 --> 20:54.854
Well, that's one problem. And it's gonna
take a while to find that out.

20:54.931 --> 20:57.732
- How much time do think?
- How many different cells in the body?

20:57.809 --> 21:01.454
1,345 at last count, grouped
together into 3 different tissue types:

21:01.531 --> 21:04.985
epithelial, mesothelial, endothelial.
Which are then sub-classed

21:05.062 --> 21:07.748
-  in thousands types of cells.
- Grand total, a million plus.

21:07.824 --> 21:08.976
Yop. Take a while.

21:09.091 --> 21:12.045
But the bigger problem is:
how is the <i>Aeromonas</i> gonna target

21:12.122 --> 21:15.077
that particular cyanobacterium
in that maze?

21:26.589 --> 21:29.045
- What?
- We don't have to target 1123-4.

21:29.352 --> 21:30.887
Not the cyanobacterium.

21:31.385 --> 21:32.421
The nanodots.

21:32.844 --> 21:33.803
What if we...

21:34.916 --> 21:36.182
What if we...

21:36.451 --> 21:37.909
Engineered it into...

21:38.369 --> 21:39.482
If we put it...

21:40.058 --> 21:43.051
Look, the nanodots are iron.
So, we have a unique target.

21:43.128 --> 21:44.701
What if we...?

21:47.732 --> 21:49.306
We need to talk to David!

21:49.920 --> 21:50.917
Nanopredator?

21:50.994 --> 21:53.105
Not only a virus that can
infect and hold the bacteria

21:53.181 --> 21:56.750
but is also designed specifically to
target the iron nanodot on its surface.

21:56.827 --> 21:59.052
- A magic bullet.
- This is good, Bob. It's good.

21:59.129 --> 22:00.664
Nanopredator, this is all really good.

22:00.741 --> 22:04.732
What are you thinking? We somehow
find a way to target the metal catalyst

22:04.808 --> 22:06.957
- with a nanopredator virus?
- Is it possible?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.260
Why not? We know
the atomic structure of the nanodots.

22:09.336 --> 22:12.790
All we need is to find a bacteriophage
that would bind with it and it alone.

22:12.867 --> 22:15.553
So we create a nanopredator
bacterial virus that will seek

22:15.629 --> 22:17.702
and destroy only cells with nanodots.

22:17.778 --> 22:19.006
Exactly.

22:22.537 --> 22:24.570
Okay, that takes care of us.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.602
What about Utah and you know,
the rest of the planet?

22:27.870 --> 22:30.250
We have to put the nano-predators
into the environment, but...

22:30.326 --> 22:32.821
- you could never get rid of them all.
- We don't have a choice.

22:32.897 --> 22:35.852
1123-4's already in the environment,
so if we wanna keep it in check.

22:36.159 --> 22:38.385
David, you're talking
about a whole new ecology.

22:40.725 --> 22:42.375
Well, yeah, if that's what it takes.

22:43.066 --> 22:44.716
Nanodot vs. nanopredator.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.553
We're gonna change the fucking rules
'cause all the rules were broken.

23:00.257 --> 23:02.982
I'll get right on producing enough
of the nanodot to do the experiment.

23:03.058 --> 23:04.325
I think I have everything I need.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.627
I'll get plenty of virus
available to start the scrape.

23:06.704 --> 23:09.505
- That's all I need.
- Bob? You're gonna be fine.

23:10.004 --> 23:11.846
Thank you. I know.

23:12.498 --> 23:15.184
She's my Mom.
Can you page her again, please?

23:18.101 --> 23:19.060
Jeff!

23:21.823 --> 23:22.782
God.

23:24.969 --> 23:26.351
What are you doing here?

23:26.428 --> 23:27.694
I gotta talk to you.

23:28.423 --> 23:29.613
Are you alright?

23:29.728 --> 23:30.956
No, Mom, I'm not.

23:34.448 --> 23:35.407
It's okay.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.016
Dad says I have to stay at Hamstead,
no matter what.

23:38.592 --> 23:40.702
Julie Henshaw is still walking
around free.

23:40.779 --> 23:43.542
Julie did not kill Tyler.

23:43.619 --> 23:45.959
Yes, she did. I know it.
Half the school knows.

23:46.036 --> 23:49.682
- The police know it.
- No, not according to the DNA tests.

23:50.104 --> 23:51.754
I know you think she's innocent.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.596
I talked to the Rodmans
at Tyler's memorial.

23:53.672 --> 23:56.052
They said you cleared her.
What the hell is that about?!

23:56.359 --> 23:58.431
DNA tests don't lie.

23:58.507 --> 24:01.155
She threatened Tyler.
I heard her. So did everyone at school.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.537
I know. But you know

24:02.613 --> 24:05.875
that saying something and doing it
are 2 completely different things.

24:07.065 --> 24:08.101
Then look at this.

24:08.523 --> 24:09.904
- Jeff, I...
- Just look.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.382
<i>What'd you just say to me,
you little prick? What'd you just say?</i>

24:19.613 --> 24:22.184
<i>- Get that fucking thing outta my face!
- You killed Tyler! Say it!</i>

24:22.260 --> 24:23.258
<i>Fuck you!</i>

24:23.795 --> 24:25.944
<i>How you'd like a trip to the hospital?</i>

24:26.021 --> 24:28.208
<i>I'll get you one day!</i>

24:29.705 --> 24:31.930
- Did you show that to Dean Miller?
- For what?

24:32.007 --> 24:33.504
She'd get a slap on the wrist.

24:33.580 --> 24:36.573
She's a fucking senator's daughter,
who you're letting get away with murder.

24:36.650 --> 24:39.375
That is not true.
All I did was read the data.

24:39.451 --> 24:40.871
Maybe you didn't read it prop.

24:40.948 --> 24:43.174
- Hey Bob.
- Who's this?

24:43.596 --> 24:44.939
This is my son Jeff.

24:45.553 --> 24:46.550
Hi, Jeff.

24:46.742 --> 24:49.505
I have a cousin named Jeff.
He's a banker in Barrie.

24:49.582 --> 24:50.656
He has a dog.

24:50.733 --> 24:52.959
She's gonna have puppies.
I think I'm gonna get one.

24:53.035 --> 24:55.683
So you're here to see what
your mother does at the shop?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.870
- Sort of.
- You headed for science, too?

24:58.791 --> 24:59.904
No, I wanna be a D.J.

24:59.981 --> 25:02.360
Oh cool. K-os, Killers, Massive Attack?

25:02.552 --> 25:03.511
Yeah.

25:03.742 --> 25:06.121
Rachel. I'm gonna need
those virus batches tonight.

25:06.197 --> 25:07.771
- Yes, they'll be ready.
- Sure.

25:26.228 --> 25:27.187
David.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.720
What the fuck?

25:29.912 --> 25:31.677
How the fuck did you get in here?

25:31.792 --> 25:34.056
The door was open.
I've been calling you.

25:35.016 --> 25:36.320
Would you people stop?

25:38.392 --> 25:39.774
How much are you drinking?

25:41.270 --> 25:43.956
I don't need a fucking wife, alright?

26:02.337 --> 26:03.642
Are you still on anti-depressants?

26:03.718 --> 26:06.213
I don't need any fucking
antidepressants.

26:06.289 --> 26:07.249
David.

26:07.556 --> 26:10.319
- You're going to kill yourself.
- No, I can't help it, Carlos.

26:10.395 --> 26:11.777
It's in my genes.

26:11.854 --> 26:13.504
- David...
- Look, I'm fine, okay!

26:13.580 --> 26:16.228
Would you leave me
the fuck alone? I'm just...

26:16.305 --> 26:17.725
I'm just tired!

26:29.582 --> 26:31.846
I think you should come back
to the lab with me.

26:32.652 --> 26:33.611
Why?

26:34.033 --> 26:35.645
I think you will be safe there.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.410
Where I can keep an eye on you.

26:38.907 --> 26:42.168
The lab doesn't feel like the safest
place in the world these days.

26:51.032 --> 26:52.068
<i>David!</i>

26:54.025 --> 26:55.100
<i>She's dead.</i>

26:59.206 --> 27:00.165
David.

27:00.434 --> 27:02.352
Let's get you some sleep. Lie down.

27:53.849 --> 27:55.768
- Jeffrey.
- Don't do the "Jeffrey" thing.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.415
- Look at this!
- I have seen it.

27:58.492 --> 27:59.758
Look at it again!

28:08.776 --> 28:11.846
<i>What'd you just say to me,
you little prick? What'd you just say?</i>

28:12.306 --> 28:14.916
<i>- Get that fucking thing outta my face!
- You killed Tyler! say it!</i>

28:14.992 --> 28:15.952
<i>Fuck you!</i>

28:16.489 --> 28:18.600
<i>How'd you like a trip to the hospital?</i>

28:18.868 --> 28:20.326
<i>I'll get you one day.</i>

28:22.552 --> 28:25.775
<i>What'd you just say to me,
you little prick? What'd you just say?</i>

28:45.346 --> 28:46.305
David.

28:50.411 --> 28:52.445
- I have some news.
- No more bad news, Bob.

28:52.521 --> 28:54.171
I think I figured it out.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.438
What? Tell me.

28:55.514 --> 28:58.431
In the mice, <i>Aeromonas</i> virus
killed the cyanobacteria.

28:58.814 --> 29:01.501
Mayko has a model of it.
But I have a problem.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.805
What?

29:04.494 --> 29:06.067
We don't have much time, David.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.022
Shit. We'll work it out, Bob.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.708
We'll work it out.
Come on, let's go see Mayko.

29:16.850 --> 29:19.958
- Tell me it's gonna work.
- In theory, it's gonna work.

29:20.035 --> 29:22.606
We modeled it after a T4
bacteriophage going after E. Coli.

29:22.682 --> 29:24.524
That's good. We know that works.

29:24.601 --> 29:27.594
I didn't have any problem
synthesizing the nanodots from 1123-4.

29:27.671 --> 29:31.009
So we selected a T4 nanopredator
which honed in on the nanodots...

29:31.086 --> 29:33.043
- And in goes the nanopredator.
- In theory.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.614
- Yes. Kick-ass science.
- Thanks. We're making progress.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.725
Progress? You got it.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.912
There are still
some bumps to smooth over.

29:39.989 --> 29:42.291
It delivered it's DNA
into the cyanobacteria,

29:42.368 --> 29:44.670
instructing it to produce masses
of nanopredator viruses.

29:44.747 --> 29:47.817
- And it multiplied and multiplied.
- The process took less than 20 minutes.

29:47.893 --> 29:48.853
What's the problem?

29:48.968 --> 29:51.654
We don't know what happened to the virus
after it killed the bacterium.

29:51.731 --> 29:55.069
It did what all viruses do. It waits
there or it looks for a new target.

29:55.146 --> 29:57.832
Well it should, but we can't find it
and we can't prove that.

29:57.909 --> 30:01.017
We have a toasted mouse that didn't get
the T4 and a happy mouse that did.

30:01.094 --> 30:02.590
I don't see what the problem is.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.775
They're trying to say that we don't know
what else the virus will do in the body.

30:05.852 --> 30:07.694
Who gives a fuck?

30:07.809 --> 30:10.227
If I analyze your gut right now,
I'd find a trillion viruses.

30:10.303 --> 30:12.606
It's the most abundant thing on
the planet. You're scared?

30:12.682 --> 30:15.292
It either works or not.
Wanna see Bob burst into flames?

30:15.369 --> 30:16.366
- David.
- What?

30:16.443 --> 30:18.860
- We're all into this together.
- No, we're not!

30:18.937 --> 30:20.127
No, you're not! Mayko!

30:20.204 --> 30:22.045
You don't have it! Bob come with me!

30:22.966 --> 30:24.041
David.

30:24.463 --> 30:26.535
What the fuck is going on around here?

30:28.223 --> 30:29.528
Where is it, Bob?

30:30.219 --> 30:31.370
- Where is it?
- Calm down.

30:31.447 --> 30:34.095
- The sample you used on the mice?
- David, what are you doing?

30:34.171 --> 30:35.361
- Stop it!
- Is that it?

30:35.438 --> 30:36.550
Yes, but we don't know...

30:47.525 --> 30:48.523
David!

30:49.329 --> 30:50.288
David!

30:55.085 --> 30:56.581
<i>David !</i>

30:57.540 --> 30:59.037
<i>Hold on, you're going to be okay.</i>

31:10.165 --> 31:13.043
<i>David, do you know where you are?</i>

31:32.844 --> 31:33.956
What time?

31:35.875 --> 31:37.218
It's 3 o'clock.

31:40.211 --> 31:41.976
I've been out for 5 hours?

31:43.051 --> 31:44.202
29, David.

31:48.193 --> 31:50.265
So what happened to the bacterium?

31:53.105 --> 31:54.985
- You're not dead.
- But it worked?

31:56.788 --> 31:59.551
Took way too much.
Perforated your stomach lining.

32:01.048 --> 32:02.045
How bad?

32:02.966 --> 32:05.346
Not bad enough that
the doctors couldn't fix it.

32:05.844 --> 32:08.799
We were able to monitor
your hydrogen production,

32:08.876 --> 32:10.526
come up with the exact dosage.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.368
You neutralize it?

32:12.598 --> 32:15.975
I injected Bob this morning.
He's taken the vaccine to Utah.

32:17.433 --> 32:18.507
How is Bob?

32:19.851 --> 32:21.347
He's overseeing the cleanup.

32:21.424 --> 32:23.611
Working with a team
of engineers from U of T

32:23.688 --> 32:26.911
trying to find a way to put
the agent into an aerosol spray.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.331
No, I meant...

32:30.902 --> 32:34.240
Well, I must've freaked him out
pretty badly back at the lab.

32:36.428 --> 32:37.502
Yes.

32:38.461 --> 32:40.994
I explained to Bob how sick you were.

32:42.107 --> 32:43.105
Good.

32:46.251 --> 32:47.556
Alright then...

32:49.129 --> 32:52.544
- Let's get outta here.
- David. I think...

32:53.350 --> 32:55.652
- I think you should stay.
- Why?

32:57.801 --> 33:00.487
You're not sick
because of the cyanobacteria.

33:02.253 --> 33:04.325
I had them do a toxicology on you.

33:04.747 --> 33:06.704
When you came in,
you were legally drunk.

33:06.781 --> 33:10.426
They found Sertraline, Citalopram
and Escitalopram in your system.

33:12.498 --> 33:13.726
Just take me home.

33:14.417 --> 33:15.990
- David, I...
- Please.

33:17.947 --> 33:20.326
- I don't think it's a good idea.
- Please.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.550
Just take me home.

33:34.985 --> 33:36.213
Alright, sit up.

34:07.755 --> 34:08.830
Julie Henshaw?

34:11.630 --> 34:12.590
Julie Henshaw?

34:14.164 --> 34:16.313
I'd recognize you anywhere. Those eyes.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.886
Bit different. So?

34:17.963 --> 34:19.958
You wanna tell me why
you assaulted my son?

34:21.032 --> 34:22.913
You're a dangerous person,
you know that.

34:22.989 --> 34:25.867
- You have anger issues.
- Bark my hole, lady.

34:25.944 --> 34:28.208
I think you were
responsible for Tyler's death.

34:28.284 --> 34:31.469
- Headline, lady: "No, I'm not!"
- And I did one of the DNA tests.

34:31.623 --> 34:33.695
So then you know
there was no match, twice.

34:33.926 --> 34:35.958
But there's that all
circumstantial evidence.

34:36.266 --> 34:37.610
You assaulted my son.

34:38.070 --> 34:39.949
Everyone knows you're homophobic.

34:40.257 --> 34:42.368
And you're clearly an unstable person.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.632
I'm gonna need another
sample and I'm all set up.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.819
We can do it right here, right now.

34:48.891 --> 34:49.927
Get real.

34:51.194 --> 34:52.844
If you don't give me a blood sample,

34:52.920 --> 34:55.146
I'm going to take this
video to the Dean's Office

34:55.530 --> 34:58.638
- and I'm going to have you expelled.
- I'm so scared.

35:00.019 --> 35:02.053
That the way you want to play it?

35:02.897 --> 35:03.857
Fine.

35:06.236 --> 35:07.847
Jeffrey don't. Leave her.

35:07.924 --> 35:10.111
You little prick. Running home to mommy?

35:10.188 --> 35:12.337
- You think you can do what you want.
- Fuck you!

35:13.143 --> 35:16.251
- She's going to bounce you outta here.
- Bullshit. She's just a fucking bitch.

35:16.328 --> 35:18.860
- She's my Mom. Watch your mouth.
- Why don't you watch your back?

35:19.091 --> 35:20.050
Fuck you.

35:20.434 --> 35:21.431
Asshole.

35:27.571 --> 35:30.526
- You okay?
- Yes. Think I have a future in science.

35:31.639 --> 35:33.404
I think you do, too. Good work.

35:44.954 --> 35:46.297
Thanks for the lift.

35:46.604 --> 35:50.134
- Look, I'm just gonna crash, so...
- Yeah, I'm staying. We need to talk.

35:50.633 --> 35:53.358
- Man, don't fuckin' do this.
- Sit down, please.

35:54.279 --> 35:55.468
David. Sit down.

36:10.856 --> 36:14.233
- David, you are a mess.
- I know, I know.

36:16.036 --> 36:18.147
But... I'm gonna...

36:19.221 --> 36:20.948
I'm gonna get through it. Yeah.

36:21.217 --> 36:22.406
It's been 6 months.

36:27.241 --> 36:29.812
Why do you put up with me?
Why don't you just let me go?

36:30.464 --> 36:32.421
Because it's time to stop running.

36:33.189 --> 36:36.297
You're right. I know that, I know that.

36:40.211 --> 36:42.514
But I can't. I just...

36:46.044 --> 36:48.461
I just keep thinking,
8 of my people died and

36:48.538 --> 36:52.337
- I walked out of there without scratch.
- That's not what this is about.

37:00.664 --> 37:02.736
Don't. Please.

37:08.070 --> 37:10.142
I know
what you've been doing, my friend.

37:12.943 --> 37:14.747
<i>I just need a little more time, Dad.</i>

37:15.169 --> 37:18.431
A lot on my plate these days.
The lab's a total fucking disaster.

37:19.697 --> 37:21.808
I got a funeral to go to
every time I turn around.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.956
You don't need any more time.

37:24.263 --> 37:26.374
I can't do it right now. Alright?

37:26.758 --> 37:29.098
I gotta do more research.
I don't know what'll happen.

37:29.252 --> 37:31.171
You know what'll happen
if you don't do it.

37:31.247 --> 37:33.703
C'mon, they're making discoveries
about Alzheimer's disease

37:33.780 --> 37:36.313
- all the time these days.
- So are you.

37:37.886 --> 37:40.073
We just don't know enough about prions.

37:40.188 --> 37:42.184
There's some evidence
that suggests that yes,

37:42.260 --> 37:46.213
- they could be used to improve memory.
- So. Improve mine.

37:46.289 --> 37:49.014
There's other evidence that suggests
they could destroy your brain.

37:49.474 --> 37:50.971
Roll the dice, David.

37:51.585 --> 37:52.928
I'm just an old man.

37:54.002 --> 37:56.497
- You're my father.
- What have I got to lose?

37:57.264 --> 37:59.528
No more booze. No more pills.

38:03.174 --> 38:06.052
David, it's been 6 months.
You have to face this.

38:06.474 --> 38:08.814
- I can't.
- You have to.

38:46.650 --> 38:50.027
Dad? I was going
over Mayko's prion studies.

38:52.022 --> 38:54.478
Dad, I want you
to come to work with me today.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.320
Take some blood.

38:57.395 --> 38:58.776
Do some tests.

39:08.177 --> 39:10.134
Come on, Dad. Rise and shine.

39:18.768 --> 39:20.303
Dad!

39:40.104 --> 39:42.368
<i>David, listen to me, listen to me.</i>

39:43.903 --> 39:46.435
You did not kill your father.
He killed himself.

39:50.081 --> 39:51.117
Help me.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.405
I'll get you all the help you need,
my friend.

40:08.615 --> 40:11.186
<i>I told dad I don't want to
board here any more and he freaked out.</i>

40:11.992 --> 40:14.064
He's under
a lot of stress these days, sweetheart.

40:14.141 --> 40:15.752
Don't take it personally.

40:17.594 --> 40:19.014
I finished those tests.

40:19.091 --> 40:20.933
I'd like
to go over the results with you.

40:21.585 --> 40:22.736
<i>Just a minute.</i>

40:24.002 --> 40:25.998
- Hey, Bob. Right there.
- Thanks.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.377
Did you see
that Auflander report on Greenway?

40:29.029 --> 40:31.332
- That was insulting.
- Total white wash.

40:31.831 --> 40:33.442
Greenway was a rogue lab.

40:33.557 --> 40:37.740
We gave no funding approval for research
in transgenic process of cyanobacteria.

40:40.311 --> 40:43.035
- How do you think David's gonna feel ?
- You're gonna tell him?

40:43.112 --> 40:45.069
I think that's Weston's job.

40:46.374 --> 40:48.638
<i>- I'm back. Shoot.</i>
- Okay...

40:49.137 --> 40:51.516
I'm downloading
some stuff onto your screen.

40:52.782 --> 40:55.699
<i>- Got it?</i>
- Yeah. Got it.

40:55.814 --> 40:56.811
<i>Alright.</i>

40:57.272 --> 41:00.879
<i>That's the DNA profile of the spit
police retrieved from Tyler's jacket.</i>

41:01.608 --> 41:02.606
Okay.

41:02.682 --> 41:06.021
<i>Now I'm gonna overlay the DNA
from Julie Henshaw's blood sample.</i>

41:08.247 --> 41:10.204
<i>See that? They don't line up.</i>

41:10.280 --> 41:11.738
But, but she did it!

41:12.468 --> 41:16.343
<i>Now here comes
the DNA from the spit you collected.</i>

41:16.573 --> 41:19.451
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna line 'em up spit-to-spit.

41:21.370 --> 41:22.636
And look at that.

41:23.174 --> 41:25.246
- A perfect match.
<i>- She did it.</i>

41:26.359 --> 41:27.702
She killed Tyler.

41:29.582 --> 41:32.153
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.029
Not much to celebrate is there.

41:37.679 --> 41:41.286
He's gone and...
Her life's down the drain now, too.

41:43.780 --> 41:45.085
I still don't get it.

41:45.161 --> 41:47.195
Spit matche, blood doesn't. Why?

41:48.116 --> 41:50.111
<i>She doesn't have a sister, does she?</i>

41:50.188 --> 41:51.570
She's an only child.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.181
<i>Then she's a chimera.</i>

41:54.064 --> 41:55.445
- A what?
- Chimera.

41:56.136 --> 41:58.899
It's 2 fertilized eggs fused
together in the uterus.

41:58.976 --> 42:00.204
Only there isn't fraternel twin,

42:00.280 --> 42:03.465
it's 2 distinct sets of DNA
come together in one person.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.652
It's rare, but it does happen.

42:05.768 --> 42:08.722
How can you have 2 sets of DNA
in one person? You'd be a freak.

42:08.799 --> 42:10.065
Not so much of a freak.

42:10.718 --> 42:14.555
Really. Her blood, brain, liver
are developed by one set of DNA

42:14.632 --> 42:17.778
while her saliva, lungs
and ovaries another.

42:18.469 --> 42:19.582
How'd you figure that out?

42:20.157 --> 42:23.458
<i>What'did you just say to me
you little prick? What'd you just say?</i>

42:28.254 --> 42:29.482
It was those eyes.

42:31.017 --> 42:32.936
Those different coloured eyes.

42:39.459 --> 42:41.378
I don't know if I can do this, man.

42:41.953 --> 42:45.484
They're gonna make me get in a circle
and hold hands with total strangers.

42:45.829 --> 42:46.903
Whatever it takes.

42:46.980 --> 42:49.513
The fucking cure
sounds worse than the disease.

42:49.705 --> 42:52.199
David, sometimes
you have to listen to other people.

42:52.276 --> 42:55.039
Sometimes other people know more
about you than you do about yourself.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.228
Well, I hate that.

42:56.343 --> 42:58.262
You wanna spend
the rest of your life in freefall?

42:58.339 --> 42:59.336
No.

43:00.104 --> 43:01.907
I just, I love single malt, you know.

43:01.984 --> 43:04.478
And I love good weed. I love bad weed.

43:06.474 --> 43:09.006
Go in there and let
them tell you what to do.

43:09.582 --> 43:11.539
Okay? One step at a time.

43:14.263 --> 43:16.873
God, you think you'd know
if you'd gone too far?

43:17.218 --> 43:19.137
David, you're going to be alright.

43:20.595 --> 43:21.976
You think you'd know.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.773
Okay. Here I go.

43:26.965 --> 43:27.963
Look,

43:28.807 --> 43:30.725
- promise me one thing.
- Anything.

43:31.416 --> 43:34.716
I come out there, I become
total boring prick, you'll tell me?

43:35.330 --> 43:36.750
it's too late for that.

43:39.091 --> 43:40.626
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

44:01.923 --> 44:05.683
We have 4 hospitals saying
it's West Nile and 3 saying it isn't.

44:05.952 --> 44:09.981
These people don't know each other,
the transmission has to be food, place.

44:10.058 --> 44:13.703
That narrows it down to a couple
thousand types of virus or bacteria.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.238
They lost another patient.

44:15.622 --> 44:17.310
She didn't even last an hour.

44:18.768 --> 44:21.186
- Herb Kinsman got the axe.
- So who's in charge?

44:21.339 --> 44:23.066
Man named Carl Riddlemayer.

44:23.143 --> 44:24.870
So what's the game here, Carl?

44:24.985 --> 44:27.709
It's all about sharpening
the tip of the spear, Dave.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.050
- I'm just do this thing with Angie.
- Who?

44:30.127 --> 44:32.544
Angelica Starov. I'd like
to talk to you about Owen.

44:32.621 --> 44:36.190
She fixes addicts by messing with
the biology in their brains.

44:36.266 --> 44:38.415
Owen, the science is way off.

44:38.492 --> 44:42.751
My first challenge is to cut 3.8 billion
dollars out of science budget.

44:43.058 --> 44:45.246
- What the hell is going on here?
- Excuse me?

44:45.399 --> 44:47.970
Science is on the verge
of unlocking the secrets of life!

44:48.047 --> 44:49.659
And you're thinking about amputating

44:49.735 --> 44:51.999
the only organization that's
actually minding the store!

44:52.076 --> 44:53.342
You're insane!

44:53.688 --> 44:54.801
All of you!
