00:10.547 --> 00:12.797
I've seen you grow up.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.130
Become a man.

00:21.297 --> 00:23.463
The whole cycle of your life.

00:24.422 --> 00:26.213
Time chose you.

00:29.005 --> 00:30.755
God chose you.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.838
Don't forget
that we are your home now, too.

00:42.922 --> 00:44.838
No harm will come to you.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.338
We're watching over you.

00:51.005 --> 00:52.547
Time is always with you.

00:54.172 --> 00:55.672
Wherever you go.

00:56.838 --> 00:58.172
You carry it in you.

00:59.422 --> 01:00.463
And it carries you.

01:05.588 --> 01:08.213
It sees and hears everything

01:08.797 --> 01:11.005
that you do and say.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.630
Claudia! Haven't you left yet?

03:35.713 --> 03:38.172
I... I forgot the milk money.

03:39.505 --> 03:41.338
-But it's okay.
-Wait.

03:47.797 --> 03:49.380
Get yourself some fruit drops.

03:52.880 --> 03:53.963
Thanks.

04:02.797 --> 04:04.463
Do you think she noticed?

04:05.130 --> 04:08.213
Don't worry.
Every family has its secrets.

04:18.547 --> 04:19.547
Are you going somewhere?

04:20.297 --> 04:21.922
Nowhere special.

04:24.630 --> 04:25.755
Just some errands.

04:40.422 --> 04:41.588
You're beautiful.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.672
JUNE 23, 1954

05:06.755 --> 05:11.130
FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

05:31.047 --> 05:32.213
Helge.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.380
And if we know that He listens
to what we ask for,

05:57.463 --> 06:00.255
we can be sure
that we have what we've asked of Him.

06:00.338 --> 06:03.880
Nothing is lost from His sight.
He returns all things.

06:08.130 --> 06:10.338
POLICE

06:10.422 --> 06:15.588
Seven months on and we still have no idea
who this monster is.

06:16.630 --> 06:21.338
Why is he refusing to reveal his identity?

06:27.088 --> 06:30.297
Why is no one looking for him?

06:30.380 --> 06:33.338
It makes you wonder
how some people live.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.338
Almost like ghosts.

06:37.672 --> 06:38.547
Egon...

06:46.630 --> 06:47.922
Can I ask you something?

06:53.838 --> 06:55.130
Your wife and you,

06:56.338 --> 06:57.713
are things still...

06:59.255 --> 07:00.422
Do you still have...

07:01.047 --> 07:01.922
A lot?

07:04.338 --> 07:05.963
No. At all.

07:07.172 --> 07:08.213
Look at that.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.630
I didn't think
they still made people like you.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.422
Boy, Egon...

07:26.630 --> 07:28.713
You've got to let off some steam.

07:30.213 --> 07:31.588
Marriage isn't...

07:31.672 --> 07:33.672
the way it's sold to us.

07:34.672 --> 07:36.463
As soon as they have children

07:37.130 --> 07:38.380
they become different people.

07:38.963 --> 07:41.630
It's like they're married to the brats.

07:42.297 --> 07:44.213
It's how nature wanted it.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.172
But out there...

07:47.255 --> 07:50.172
there are still loads
of tender buds to pluck.

07:52.797 --> 07:54.130
They found him!

07:54.713 --> 07:55.755
Found who?

07:56.380 --> 07:57.713
The Doppler boy.

07:57.797 --> 07:59.255
Helge Doppler?

07:59.797 --> 08:01.172
-His body?
-No.

08:01.255 --> 08:02.672
The boy is alive.

08:02.755 --> 08:05.505
He just walked in the door
as if nothing had happened.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.630
<i>Do you like your mother?</i>

08:12.422 --> 08:16.547
Mine is peculiar sometimes.
She always acts like I don't get anything.

08:17.672 --> 08:19.922
When I have kids I'll be different.

08:23.047 --> 08:26.297
How come you never talk about
how it was where you're from?

08:26.380 --> 08:28.255
Before you came to Winden?

08:29.713 --> 08:31.505
My mother was often sad.

08:32.297 --> 08:33.922
I was in an orphanage for ages.

08:35.047 --> 08:38.505
She doesn't like to talk about it,
so I don't, either.

08:38.588 --> 08:41.047
Don't you have any family
besides your mother?

08:41.713 --> 08:42.880
My mother has a brother.

08:44.255 --> 08:46.047
But I think they hate each other.

08:46.672 --> 08:48.963
Do you think she's happy here?

09:00.880 --> 09:01.880
Will you show it to me now?

09:35.713 --> 09:37.547
Where are those damn ghosts?

09:40.588 --> 09:42.630
-Have you seen my book?
-What book?

09:42.713 --> 09:44.088
<i>The Ghosts</i>!

09:46.130 --> 09:48.630
You don't have to gawp at me like that.
I know I'm late.

09:52.755 --> 09:55.130
-Did you put that there?
-No, I...

09:57.172 --> 09:59.213
I thought maybe...

10:00.047 --> 10:02.463
Maybe you'd like to skip school
and we'll do something nice.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.338
I don't know. I just thought we haven't
done anything together in so long.

10:09.255 --> 10:12.630
I have a German exam today,
and I wanted to go to the lake later.

10:14.672 --> 10:16.047
Maybe another time.

10:18.755 --> 10:19.880
Regina, wait.

10:35.963 --> 10:38.297
I like how you wear your hair now.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.213
It makes you look so... grown up.

10:46.838 --> 10:47.672
Thanks.

10:51.088 --> 10:53.922
I don't have any time. I have to go.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.297
Time...

11:23.255 --> 11:24.755
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

11:29.338 --> 11:33.338
FOR CLAUDIA FROM HELGE

12:07.130 --> 12:08.588
Hello, Mrs. Doppler.

12:09.005 --> 12:11.005
I've already told
your colleagues everything.

12:12.338 --> 12:14.755
I'd like to ask Helge a few questions.

12:16.005 --> 12:18.213
He still hasn't said a single word.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.172
Something is odd about the boy.

12:28.838 --> 12:30.255
It won't take long.

12:49.713 --> 12:50.797
Helge.

12:53.838 --> 12:54.922
Remember me?

12:58.172 --> 12:59.672
I'm Claudia's father.

13:09.005 --> 13:12.172
Won't you tell me
where you were all this time?

13:14.005 --> 13:14.880
And with whom?

13:17.588 --> 13:18.963
Who did that to you?

13:21.463 --> 13:24.088
The inspector asked you something.

13:26.255 --> 13:28.505
Say something, for goodness sake!

13:40.630 --> 13:43.255
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

13:47.213 --> 13:49.338
It may sound peculiar, but I...

13:54.463 --> 13:56.130
The book from last year.

13:58.047 --> 14:00.422
-Why did you give it to me?
-I...

14:01.630 --> 14:03.422
thought...

14:04.005 --> 14:07.172
you may be the only one
who understands me.

14:12.338 --> 14:17.963
Time is always with you
wherever you go.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.213
You carry it in you.

14:21.838 --> 14:23.547
And it carries you.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.630
It sees and hears everything you do

14:26.713 --> 14:28.005
and say.

14:29.463 --> 14:30.713
What's that supposed to mean?

14:31.713 --> 14:33.047
He said...

14:35.047 --> 14:38.963
it's a battle between good and evil,
between light and dark.

14:39.422 --> 14:42.463
That the travelers can undo
everything that happens.

14:44.005 --> 14:47.630
If we succeed, none of it will happen.

14:48.880 --> 14:49.880
Who said that?

14:50.505 --> 14:51.338
Noah.

14:53.838 --> 14:55.172
Who is Noah?

14:57.922 --> 15:01.297
You mustn't trust him. Never! Do you hear?

15:01.630 --> 15:03.172
Never!

15:03.630 --> 15:04.463
Helge!

15:07.880 --> 15:08.922
I'm sorry.

15:11.130 --> 15:12.838
I didn't want all this.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.630
Did anybody see you?

16:26.172 --> 16:28.422
They sent Helge back today.

16:30.630 --> 16:32.172
Noah is back, too.

16:33.505 --> 16:35.130
I'm not scared of him anymore.

16:36.088 --> 16:37.963
You carry the same blood.

16:38.047 --> 16:40.088
You can't choose your family.

16:40.172 --> 16:42.463
Renouncing your blood
means freeing yourself.

16:42.797 --> 16:43.963
You said so yourself.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.088
Still, our family shapes us
our entire lives.

16:50.213 --> 16:51.922
Sic Mundus...

16:53.547 --> 16:55.713
They're preparing the next cycle.

16:56.963 --> 16:58.130
In four days.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.838
Your brother is a blind fool.

17:03.047 --> 17:05.463
All the suffering he causes people.

17:05.547 --> 17:07.297
But it will have an end.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.463
You must give me this.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.088
Not now. There is still time.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.713
Today?

17:35.630 --> 17:37.172
I wanted to thank you.

17:38.213 --> 17:39.172
For everything.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.547
My mother loves you, do you know that?

17:48.755 --> 17:51.922
She will make you very happy
if you let her.

18:36.838 --> 18:38.922
Are you HG Tannhaus?

18:42.755 --> 18:44.588
Heterochromia.

18:45.755 --> 18:47.255
One blue eye,

18:48.797 --> 18:49.838
one brown.

18:56.172 --> 18:58.172
Did you write this book?

18:59.713 --> 19:02.338
I wondered when the day would come.

19:05.130 --> 19:07.088
When we'd meet again.

19:08.172 --> 19:09.755
I don't even know you.

19:10.672 --> 19:12.713
But I know you.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.963
A never-ending cycle.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.047
Peculiar.

19:26.463 --> 19:27.838
And he didn't talk?

19:30.172 --> 19:31.838
What do you make of it?

19:32.755 --> 19:34.880
He just turns up out of nowhere.

19:35.713 --> 19:39.672
Maybe they are unrelated after all.

19:43.255 --> 19:46.630
The madman who killed the children
and the Doppler boy.

19:46.713 --> 19:48.588
How could he have done it?

19:49.547 --> 19:51.088
He's been doing time for six months.

19:53.422 --> 19:54.922
Maybe he wasn't alone.

19:56.172 --> 19:57.922
You mean he has an accomplice?

19:59.172 --> 20:00.922
Visit the madman again.

20:02.755 --> 20:04.380
Maybe he'll talk now.

20:08.130 --> 20:10.380
An accomplice. Yes.

20:20.880 --> 20:25.963
CLOSED PSYCHIATRIC WARD 3

20:31.130 --> 20:33.755
I want to know what it all means.

20:38.463 --> 20:40.047
These lyrics.

20:41.047 --> 20:44.672
You said those words to me in 1953.

20:45.547 --> 20:50.255
But this was only released last year.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.172
You said...

21:01.797 --> 21:03.880
you had a son yourself.

21:05.005 --> 21:07.338
Why did you murder the children?

21:09.880 --> 21:11.713
I didn't murder the children.

21:14.130 --> 21:15.380
I wanted to save them.

21:24.838 --> 21:26.963
You said I was going to die.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.838
How did you know I have cancer?

21:42.880 --> 21:44.630
The White Devil?

21:46.838 --> 21:48.547
Do you know who that is?

21:50.922 --> 21:53.213
You're more deranged than I am.

21:59.713 --> 22:03.088
Why did you never tell us
what your name is?

22:04.130 --> 22:05.297
Who you are?

22:10.297 --> 22:11.505
Ulrich.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.088
Ulrich Nielsen.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.297
And I come from the future.

22:21.672 --> 22:25.088
I am what one calls a fraud.

22:29.963 --> 22:32.963
Have you ever heard 
of the bootstrap paradox?

22:34.380 --> 22:35.380
No.

22:36.047 --> 22:38.505
In a bootstrap paradox,

22:39.463 --> 22:41.130
an object

22:41.797 --> 22:43.338
or information

22:43.422 --> 22:47.630
from the future is sent back to the past.

22:47.713 --> 22:52.505
That creates a never-ending cycle

22:52.588 --> 22:57.088
in which the object
no longer has any real origin.

22:57.172 --> 22:58.838
It exists

23:00.172 --> 23:02.838
without ever having been created.

23:02.922 --> 23:04.255
Put simply,

23:04.880 --> 23:08.588
this book has traveled back in time.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.005
It found me

23:12.088 --> 23:14.922
before I even wrote it.

23:16.672 --> 23:18.838
<i>It's all a question of origin.</i>

23:19.880 --> 23:23.297
<i>Where is the beginning?</i>
<i>When is the beginning?</i>

23:23.380 --> 23:25.963
<i>Is there a beginning at all?</i>

23:28.338 --> 23:31.630
<i>The world is full of such paradoxes.</i>

23:31.713 --> 23:34.922
<i>Only most of the time,</i>
<i>we choose to look away.</i>

23:36.672 --> 23:38.922
Good luck, but he doesn't talk.

23:39.588 --> 23:40.463
To anyone.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.547
I don't think
you'll get anything out of him.

24:03.505 --> 24:04.505
Hello.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.755
My name is Tiedemann.

24:11.422 --> 24:13.922
Egon Tiedemann. Do you remember me?

24:14.547 --> 24:16.255
I arrested you last year.

24:18.297 --> 24:22.047
There are a few things
I'd like to ask you.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.130
The Doppler boy is back home.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.297
I want to know where Helge was.

24:37.005 --> 24:38.255
Do you have an accomplice?

24:39.547 --> 24:41.297
If you talk to me it...

24:41.963 --> 24:44.297
might influence your situation here.

24:47.213 --> 24:48.838
It's his medication.

24:49.963 --> 24:51.297
We have to sedate him.

24:52.338 --> 24:55.005
Has he said what his name is yet?

24:56.172 --> 24:57.588
Not to my knowledge.

25:21.963 --> 25:24.130
My name is Ulrich Nielsen.

25:24.213 --> 25:25.547
MADS NIELSEN (12) MISSING

25:25.630 --> 25:27.130
MADS NIELSEN CASE:
POLICE IN DARK

25:27.213 --> 25:29.005
WINDEN BOY VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE

25:33.338 --> 25:36.047
REFERENCE FILE

25:38.797 --> 25:40.005
INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

25:40.088 --> 25:41.755
Name unknown.

25:42.338 --> 25:44.088
Age nine to 11.

25:44.172 --> 25:47.672
Claims his father's name
is Ulrich Nielsen.

25:50.672 --> 25:52.547
Don't you want to tell me at last

25:52.630 --> 25:54.588
why you're really here?

25:55.880 --> 25:57.963
You want to know how it works.

25:58.547 --> 25:59.588
How did you know that?

26:00.672 --> 26:05.547
She told me
that you would turn up here one day

26:05.630 --> 26:08.130
and that I should explain the device 
to you.

26:08.797 --> 26:09.880
That is,

26:10.422 --> 26:11.672
you, yourself.

26:12.047 --> 26:14.213
Your future self.

26:14.880 --> 26:21.422
The paradox is that a short time ago
I wouldn't have been to explain it to you.

26:21.505 --> 26:23.047
But last year

26:23.130 --> 26:25.505
someone else explained it to me.

26:25.588 --> 26:27.005
Another...

26:28.005 --> 26:29.588
time traveler.

26:30.963 --> 26:33.255
I think she knew it.

26:34.005 --> 26:37.213
She knew everything that would happen,

26:37.297 --> 26:40.005
right up to the present moment.

26:40.672 --> 26:43.297
She knew that you would show up here

26:43.380 --> 26:44.838
for me to tell you,

26:44.922 --> 26:46.505
and therefore her,

26:47.588 --> 26:49.755
how the device works.

26:58.172 --> 26:59.963
<i>I find him creepy.</i>

27:00.380 --> 27:03.630
As if he were empty inside now,
merely a husk.

27:06.338 --> 27:10.755
He was never the brightest child,
but you could now believe he's mindless.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.755
He scares me.

27:14.838 --> 27:18.505
And without Bernd at home, I don't know 
how to deal with the situation.

27:19.755 --> 27:22.172
Perhaps the devil himself
has possessed him.

27:22.963 --> 27:26.588
Please look at him and tell me
everything is all right with him.

27:28.422 --> 27:30.380
And he hasn't said a word?

27:40.672 --> 27:43.505
Helge, come downstairs.
Someone wants to talk to you.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.213
Time is always with you.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.963
Wherever you go.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.963
You carry it in you.

28:15.047 --> 28:16.713
And it carries you.

28:17.380 --> 28:20.755
It sees and hears everything
that you do and say.

28:25.672 --> 28:27.672
Your mother is worried about you.

28:30.338 --> 28:32.963
Shall we show her she has no reason to be?

28:38.422 --> 28:40.505
I'd like you to read this for me.

28:42.338 --> 28:43.547
Will you do that?

28:46.838 --> 28:48.255
"You are my protection,

28:49.588 --> 28:50.630
my shield.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.422
I hope for your word."

28:58.713 --> 29:00.047
He speaks!

29:02.505 --> 29:04.422
Give him a little time.

29:05.338 --> 29:08.255
I'm sure he's just choosing his words
with great care.

29:10.255 --> 29:11.588
You can keep it.

29:12.797 --> 29:14.463
Won't you stay a while?

29:22.172 --> 29:23.838
He has returned.

29:28.297 --> 29:29.547
To your bosom.

29:32.630 --> 29:33.922
He is a miracle.

29:35.630 --> 29:36.922
Don't forget that.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.713
So just what are you doing here?

29:49.297 --> 29:51.422
I'm merely trying

29:51.505 --> 29:55.588
to fill in some gaps in a few old files.

29:56.255 --> 29:57.672
Just to order things.

30:00.297 --> 30:02.380
I'd like to talk to the boy.

30:06.088 --> 30:07.422
Michael's asleep.

30:08.380 --> 30:09.880
During the day?

30:10.547 --> 30:12.338
He wasn't feeling well.

30:12.422 --> 30:15.797
Has he ever said anything to you
about his parents?

30:19.713 --> 30:21.463
Michael wants to put that all behind him.

30:23.463 --> 30:24.922
He has a new life now.

30:32.088 --> 30:35.047
Has he ever mentioned their names to you?

30:36.255 --> 30:38.797
First names? Nicknames?

30:42.380 --> 30:44.588
The name Ulrich?

30:44.672 --> 30:47.130
He hasn't mentioned that to you, either?

30:57.630 --> 30:59.255
Has he ever...

31:00.880 --> 31:03.547
talked about a "White Devil"?

31:04.963 --> 31:05.963
No.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.838
I don't understand
what the point of all these questions is.

31:11.838 --> 31:14.588
Perhaps I can talk to him tomorrow?

31:18.672 --> 31:20.297
-Yes.
-Fine.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.130
If anything else comes to mind,

31:25.213 --> 31:27.297
just give me a call.

31:31.755 --> 31:32.880
All right.

31:46.922 --> 31:48.547
SLEEPING PILLS

31:50.547 --> 31:52.005
I, um...

31:53.005 --> 31:55.047
I've been sleeping badly again.

31:56.797 --> 31:57.922
Nightmares.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.463
One more thing.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.130
Do you maybe have a photo of the boy?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.380
Just for the files.

32:18.422 --> 32:19.880
Just for the files, right?

32:27.297 --> 32:29.047
Just for the files.

32:56.130 --> 32:57.422
What do you want here?

33:02.130 --> 33:03.880
Did Claudia send you?

33:08.505 --> 33:10.963
If you think Adam will let you back in,
you're wrong.

33:12.547 --> 33:13.838
You picked your side.

33:15.213 --> 33:17.172
There's no salvation for you.

33:21.588 --> 33:23.672
I know where the final pages are.

33:24.672 --> 33:27.505
I also know
how long Adam's been looking for them.

33:28.380 --> 33:30.755
Don't you think he'd do anything 
to get them?

33:31.338 --> 33:33.130
I don't believe a word you say.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.880
She would never have told you
where they are.

33:41.630 --> 33:43.380
Claudia has them on her.

33:57.505 --> 34:00.255
In return, I want you to tell Adam
I want to come back.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.672
Before the new cycle begins.

34:04.255 --> 34:05.713
You're sacrificing her?

34:09.422 --> 34:12.547
You can't hate your own sister
the way you hate her.

34:23.588 --> 34:25.838
Consider it a peace offering.

35:00.172 --> 35:01.213
Yes?

35:04.963 --> 35:07.047
There's someone here to see you.

35:07.672 --> 35:09.172
All right.

35:12.422 --> 35:13.797
You can go in.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.088
Can I help you?

35:44.630 --> 35:47.088
One brown eye, one blue eye.

35:49.088 --> 35:50.338
That's rare.

35:51.755 --> 35:53.047
Like my daughter.

35:54.463 --> 35:56.588
You're too good a person.

35:58.047 --> 35:59.588
But you always have been.

36:02.380 --> 36:04.255
The world doesn't deserve you.

36:09.005 --> 36:10.505
Excuse me, but...

36:12.130 --> 36:13.172
do we know each other?

36:15.797 --> 36:18.172
I'm here
because I have to tell you something.

36:20.713 --> 36:22.213
I'm sorry.

36:26.463 --> 36:27.755
What are you sorry about?

36:29.547 --> 36:30.963
Everything.

36:33.297 --> 36:35.172
You don't deserve any of this.

36:39.588 --> 36:42.588
But sometimes
the good ones get hit hardest.

36:47.297 --> 36:48.755
I don't understand.

36:51.255 --> 36:53.422
You will one day.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.297
And then I want you to know

36:58.463 --> 37:02.672
that I'm sorry that things turned out
the way they turned out.

37:08.213 --> 37:11.297
Either you tell me this instant
what this is all about

37:12.505 --> 37:14.463
or I'll ask you to leave immediately.

37:22.797 --> 37:24.713
I am sorry, I really am.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.380
Ms. Tiedemann,
I've been trying to reach you all day.

37:50.838 --> 37:53.755
The people from the press waited 
for over an hour.

37:54.547 --> 37:55.422
And...

37:56.255 --> 37:57.088
And?

37:57.547 --> 37:59.838
I postponed the meeting
till 10:30 tomorrow.

37:59.922 --> 38:02.005
You meet the union reps after that.

38:06.338 --> 38:07.755
Cancel all appointments.

38:10.213 --> 38:12.255
And one more thing, your father...

38:13.713 --> 38:14.630
He's here.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.880
I didn't know where to put him.

38:37.088 --> 38:38.630
What are you doing here?

38:39.505 --> 38:41.047
Why didn't you call first?

38:44.422 --> 38:46.088
I wanted to talk to you.

38:46.672 --> 38:49.463
-It won't take long.
-This is really a bad time.

38:50.713 --> 38:52.463
You can just show up here.

38:52.797 --> 38:56.213
Why don't you make an appointment
with my secretary that suits us both?

38:57.380 --> 39:00.047
-Next week, for example.
-I have cancer.

39:06.047 --> 39:07.380
Prostate.

39:09.797 --> 39:12.005
I didn't want to upset you.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.005
But now the cancer has spread.

39:17.130 --> 39:18.963
And I thought

39:19.547 --> 39:21.838
it's best if you know that.

39:23.463 --> 39:24.505
I...

39:28.672 --> 39:30.338
I don't know what to say.

39:31.297 --> 39:32.713
It's okay.

39:34.422 --> 39:36.713
I just wanted you to know.

39:37.963 --> 39:39.672
I'll be on my way then.

39:41.297 --> 39:43.797
I'm sure you have loads to do here.

39:47.463 --> 39:48.463
Dad.

40:15.713 --> 40:18.672
-You're back!
-Hello, my precocious princess.

40:20.755 --> 40:21.755
Where's Mom?

40:44.505 --> 40:45.880
You look sad.

40:50.255 --> 40:52.630
Can you keep a secret?

40:59.797 --> 41:01.922
I think I saw a witch today.

41:02.713 --> 41:04.922
-There are no witches.
-There are!

41:05.838 --> 41:06.755
This one was very real.

41:09.338 --> 41:10.963
How did she look?

41:12.505 --> 41:14.380
Long white hair.

41:15.047 --> 41:16.338
Like in books.

41:17.547 --> 41:18.713
And what did she say?

41:22.005 --> 41:24.255
That she was sorry.

41:26.588 --> 41:28.963
That doesn't sound like a witch.

41:32.672 --> 41:34.047
How would you know?

41:34.630 --> 41:36.255
You've never seen one.

41:39.380 --> 41:40.755
Are those for Mom?

41:46.547 --> 41:47.588
Yes.

41:51.088 --> 41:52.797
You're too good a person, Dad.

41:53.755 --> 41:55.463
The world doesn't deserve you.

42:05.505 --> 42:06.963
Everything okay?

42:11.088 --> 42:12.130
Yes.

42:14.630 --> 42:16.088
It's just déjà vu.

42:17.547 --> 42:22.255
<i>I used to think the worst thing</i>
<i>that could happen to a person in life</i>

42:23.630 --> 42:25.672
<i>is to lose your own child.</i>

42:27.047 --> 42:29.338
But we can't do anything about that.

42:31.672 --> 42:35.922
No matter how hard we try
to hold on to them,

42:37.713 --> 42:40.838
they still leave, sooner or later.

42:41.797 --> 42:43.047
Parents...

42:43.797 --> 42:45.005
Children...

42:45.713 --> 42:51.047
They only share a common path
for a part of their lives.

42:52.172 --> 42:53.380
In the end...

42:54.505 --> 42:57.005
they are miles away from one another.

43:05.130 --> 43:06.630
Last winter

43:08.047 --> 43:10.547
a boy came to Winden.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.588
A stranger.

43:13.588 --> 43:17.588
He said something peculiar to me
at the time.

43:17.672 --> 43:19.505
It makes no sense, but...

43:21.755 --> 43:25.505
Maybe my cancer
is already driving me crazy.

43:32.130 --> 43:33.880
Do you know this boy?

43:43.880 --> 43:45.338
He's here?

43:48.088 --> 43:51.963
Where is he?
You knew he was here?

43:52.755 --> 43:54.505
You knew the whole time?

43:55.422 --> 43:57.255
Where is he? Where is he?

44:10.297 --> 44:11.922
Let go of me!

44:12.588 --> 44:13.922
Where is Mikkel?

44:20.588 --> 44:21.630
I'm closed for the day.

44:26.713 --> 44:27.880
It's you!

44:27.963 --> 44:28.963
I...

44:29.588 --> 44:31.797
It's not ready yet.

44:32.838 --> 44:36.005
It'll take another 33 years
before it's ready.

44:36.088 --> 44:38.172
This thing... The blueprint...

44:38.797 --> 44:40.130
I don't really understand what it is.

44:49.047 --> 44:50.463
I've seen this before.

44:52.588 --> 44:55.297
All our lives
we wonder what our journey will be.

44:56.380 --> 44:57.547
This is yours.

44:58.338 --> 45:00.963
-Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
-Why are you giving it to me?

45:02.922 --> 45:04.672
I'll be dead soon.

45:05.547 --> 45:07.713
I don't understand.

45:08.713 --> 45:09.838
You will.

45:10.963 --> 45:12.130
One day.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.713
And then we'll meet again.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.755
Before you die.

45:19.005 --> 45:20.547
No. After that.

45:21.713 --> 45:22.922
How...

45:23.672 --> 45:25.338
How can that be possible?

45:26.213 --> 45:28.130
Time is just an illusion.

45:29.463 --> 45:31.588
Then you'll have to explain
the device to me.

45:31.672 --> 45:35.297
But I don't know what it's for.
Why don't you tell me what it's for?

45:35.380 --> 45:38.713
Because you told me
someone else explained it to you.

45:39.422 --> 45:41.963
Things take their course,
as they always have.

45:43.422 --> 45:46.713
No, I didn't tell you anything.
No one explained anything to me.

45:47.422 --> 45:50.588
Not now, but in the future.

45:51.172 --> 45:53.338
All this will come to an end soon.

45:54.630 --> 45:57.630
But until then everything must remain
as it always has been.

45:59.297 --> 46:01.505
Wait. Please.

48:00.047 --> 48:01.963
You thought you could trust her.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.047
She betrayed you.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.588
She didn't even bat an eyelid.

48:15.047 --> 48:16.672
You took everything from me.

48:17.755 --> 48:18.838
You're going to die!

48:19.963 --> 48:21.672
And everything you stand for
will die with you.

48:23.047 --> 48:25.255
I know that I am going to die.

48:26.797 --> 48:29.005
But am I going to lose this match?

48:29.463 --> 48:33.088
Or is this here, our meeting,
you and your gun,

48:33.922 --> 48:37.463
only part of a game
you still don't know how to play.

48:37.547 --> 48:40.797
You think you can manipulate me
with your words.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.297
I'm no longer one of your pawns.

48:47.130 --> 48:48.755
But you're still one of Adam's.

48:50.088 --> 48:53.963
The paradise he's promising you
is nothing but a lie.

48:54.547 --> 48:57.463
He's selling you the illusion of freedom.

48:58.297 --> 49:01.213
Ask yourself if you are really free.

49:01.588 --> 49:03.547
If you were really free,

49:05.088 --> 49:06.797
you'd have a choice.

49:08.380 --> 49:09.922
Do you have a choice?

49:52.422 --> 49:56.672
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

50:39.838 --> 50:41.047
That can't be.

50:46.338 --> 50:47.338
Charlotte?

50:48.297 --> 50:49.172
That's not...

50:49.880 --> 50:51.630
No, this isn't right.

50:52.255 --> 50:53.713
