01:22.582 --> 01:26.217
So, what are you gonna do
  about your problem, Reiger?

01:26.285 --> 01:27.352
What?

01:27.420 --> 01:28.920
What are you talking about,
          my problem?

01:29.021 --> 01:31.956
Latka's girlfriend
        is coming back.

01:32.024 --> 01:33.591
Who else is gonna tell her

01:33.658 --> 01:36.895
that he's become
   the Three Faces of Weird?

01:36.962 --> 01:39.431
You know, Louie,
Louie, even for you,

01:39.498 --> 01:41.666
there's gotta be a more
sensitive and caring way

01:41.734 --> 01:43.201
to refer to someone
who suffers

01:43.269 --> 01:44.969
from multiple personality.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.605
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:47.673 --> 01:50.141
I was talking
      about the gentleman

01:50.209 --> 01:51.676
who suffers from...

01:51.743 --> 01:54.012
(babbling)

01:56.181 --> 01:58.683
ALEX:
                        Latka...

01:58.717 --> 02:00.485
how many times
     have you shaved today?

02:00.553 --> 02:04.923
Eh, twice on my face
      and once on my back.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.158
I want to look good for Simka.

02:08.259 --> 02:09.526
(clears throat)

02:09.562 --> 02:12.363
Have you, uh,
      a girlfriend, Latka?

02:12.431 --> 02:14.699
Oh, yeah, she's a girl
     from Latka's country.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.167
And when she first
        came to America,

02:16.235 --> 02:18.536
she and Latka were dating
    each other for a while.

02:18.604 --> 02:20.505
Yeah, then I let her slip away.

02:20.572 --> 02:22.640
Boy, what a fool I was.

02:22.708 --> 02:25.943
I'm sorry that she left
 before I told her I love her.

02:25.978 --> 02:27.812
Latka, are you gonna
   tell her you love her now?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.147
I will not make

02:29.248 --> 02:30.815
the same mistake again.
   Good.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.817
She is the girl for me
      in the whole world.

02:32.885 --> 02:34.019
Good, good.

02:34.086 --> 02:36.054
Yeah, excuse me, Elaine.

02:36.121 --> 02:39.290
I'm sorry, but she's better
      than American women.

02:39.358 --> 02:41.626
I don't even like
        American women.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.428
I have a good reason, too.

02:43.562 --> 02:44.796
What's that?

02:44.897 --> 02:46.631
They don't give me
        the time of day.

02:46.698 --> 02:48.199
Oh.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.401
Latka, you know,
      you ought to get rid

02:50.469 --> 02:52.537
of all that tissue paper
         on your face.

02:52.605 --> 02:56.107
You know, what you need to use
  is a styptic pencil instead.

02:56.141 --> 02:57.208
Styptic pencil?

02:57.276 --> 02:58.376
Styptic pencil.

02:58.444 --> 02:59.411
Where will I find one?

02:59.511 --> 03:01.813
Here, use mine.

03:01.914 --> 03:04.082
No, no, no, Jim, Jim, Jim!

03:04.149 --> 03:06.117
He needs a styptic
pencil, not--

03:06.185 --> 03:08.619
By golly, that's
a styptic pencil.

03:08.687 --> 03:10.654
I will try it.

03:10.722 --> 03:13.758
Why are you carrying a
styptic pencil in your ear?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.228
Well, in light of
            what just happened,

03:16.295 --> 03:18.896
a better question is,
            "Why aren't you?"

03:24.937 --> 03:26.103
Hey!

03:26.171 --> 03:28.339
Hey!
       Oh!

03:28.441 --> 03:30.341
Is-Is Latka here?

03:30.409 --> 03:32.543
Oh, yeah, and he's
dying to see you.
                      Mm-hmm!

03:32.612 --> 03:33.878
Yeah, yeah, he'll be right out.

03:33.946 --> 03:37.515
Oh, it is good
     to hear you say that.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.984
I miss him.

03:40.052 --> 03:43.788
I've not had too much
     luck with men lately.
                             Oh?

03:43.856 --> 03:47.359
Elaine, you know
              what it feels like

03:47.426 --> 03:51.129
to be used,
              taken advantage of

03:51.197 --> 03:54.266
and then thrown away
               like an old shoe?

03:54.333 --> 03:57.669
Does she.

04:03.008 --> 04:04.242
Simka.

04:04.343 --> 04:06.945
Latka.

04:07.012 --> 04:09.547
Simka.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.024
Well, are you going
            to just stand there?

04:20.091 --> 04:22.226
Oh.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.364
(speaking native language)

04:28.367 --> 04:30.234
Oh, oh, Latka, Latka,

04:30.302 --> 04:33.538
we can speak English now.

04:33.606 --> 04:38.142
I feel very comfortable in
      that tongue, you bet, Joe!

04:38.177 --> 04:40.478
You are looking very well.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.280
Oh, I cannot complain.

04:43.382 --> 04:46.384
You are looking well also.

04:46.451 --> 04:48.452
Are you available
for getting together?

04:48.520 --> 04:52.790
Yes, you may call me
         for social engagements.

04:52.858 --> 04:56.427
Whew! This is just like
         in <i>Body Heat.</i>

04:56.562 --> 04:58.629
SIMKA:
Latka,

04:58.698 --> 05:01.132
Latka, let's have lunch.

05:01.199 --> 05:04.102
Okay, but let me just
grab a quick shave.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.104
Okay.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.779
Oh, is same sweet man.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.547
Yeah, well, listen, I,
        uh, I'll be going along.

05:16.615 --> 05:17.982
So long.

05:18.050 --> 05:18.883
(bell dings)

05:18.951 --> 05:20.451
Calling Dr. Reiger.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.053
(ringing bell)
                 Oh, Dr. Reiger?

05:23.121 --> 05:26.624
Uh, Simka, Simka, can I
       talk to you for a second?

05:26.692 --> 05:28.693
Over here, please?
Yes, excuse me.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.462
Uh, Simka, uh...

05:31.530 --> 05:33.931
I think there's something
you have to know about Latka.

05:33.999 --> 05:35.266
Oh, no...
No, no, no,

05:35.334 --> 05:36.501
there's nothing to
be alarmed about.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.703
Believe me, nothing.
Sit down, please.

05:38.770 --> 05:43.141
Look, Latka has
what doctors call,

05:43.209 --> 05:45.443
uh, multiple personality.

05:45.477 --> 05:48.513
You see, sometimes, uh,

05:48.580 --> 05:50.748
and he's not even
aware he's doing it,

05:50.816 --> 05:54.052
he totally becomes
        another person.

05:54.186 --> 05:59.190
I mean, his walk, his talk
becomes totally different.

05:59.257 --> 06:02.393
You understand?

06:02.461 --> 06:04.395
Yes, he's <i>kookiputz.</i>

06:08.901 --> 06:11.802
(man sings "Love Me Tender"
      in Latka's language)

06:21.947 --> 06:23.415
(knocking on door)

06:23.482 --> 06:25.784
Just a minute.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.322
(volume decreases)

06:38.297 --> 06:39.631
Hello, Simka.

06:39.698 --> 06:42.099
Hello, Latka.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.501
Come in.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.379
Take it for you.

06:55.447 --> 06:58.716
You are looking even more
   gorgeous than normal for you.

06:58.817 --> 07:03.821
Well... you are not looking
       so awful yourself.

07:07.526 --> 07:09.259
I hope you are hungry.

07:09.327 --> 07:10.929
I made something special.

07:10.996 --> 07:13.264
Oh, I am! What is it?

07:13.332 --> 07:15.065
Smell.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.433
(sniffing)

07:16.502 --> 07:18.836
Warthog!

07:18.904 --> 07:21.138
I think it's ready now.

07:21.173 --> 07:22.873
Oh, lovely.

07:25.010 --> 07:26.944
And the salad.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.153
Mmm...

07:35.221 --> 07:38.356
So, what would you like?

07:38.423 --> 07:41.125
Eh, would you like
something from the hoof

07:41.193 --> 07:44.963
or something
close to the tusk?

07:45.030 --> 07:46.597
Both!

07:46.665 --> 07:49.367
That's what I love about you,
     you eat like a swine.

07:49.434 --> 07:52.570
Oh, you!

07:59.478 --> 08:00.911
I hope you like it.

08:00.979 --> 08:02.280
Oh...

08:02.347 --> 08:03.581
You know,
it's hard to find

08:03.648 --> 08:06.417
self-basting warthog
in America.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.720
It is perfect, Latka.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.422
Everything is perfect.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.790
The flowers,

08:12.858 --> 08:16.194
the candles, the music.

08:16.261 --> 08:17.628
Brethnees?

08:17.729 --> 08:21.599
Well, maybe just
                    a quick one.

08:44.723 --> 08:46.990
You know, Latka,

08:47.059 --> 08:51.228
I have had many lonely nights

08:51.296 --> 08:53.263
since I last saw you.

08:53.365 --> 08:56.501
Well, you know, it hasn't been
   all brethnees and warthog

08:56.568 --> 08:58.702
for Mama Gravas's
       little boy either.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.605
That's why I was so glad

09:01.673 --> 09:03.641
that you wrote me when
you discovered that Omaha

09:03.709 --> 09:07.044
was not all the
songs say it is.

09:07.146 --> 09:10.815
Here is mud in your <i>blifnik.</i>

09:24.630 --> 09:28.098
Simka, Simka,

09:28.166 --> 09:29.800
I want to tell you something.

09:29.868 --> 09:31.302
Oh?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.504
(clearing throat)

09:37.409 --> 09:41.879
This is the best evening
I've had in a long time.

09:41.946 --> 09:44.782
I've dreamed about this
evening, and you.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.484
And I just want
to tell you that...

09:52.824 --> 09:55.926
What is it you want to say?

09:56.028 --> 09:58.629
Well...

09:58.697 --> 10:01.065
I want to say that...

10:02.467 --> 10:03.667
I...

10:06.905 --> 10:09.306
(sniffing)

10:09.375 --> 10:11.942
(as Vic Ferrari):
       What died in here?

10:12.010 --> 10:13.811
Oh, my gosh!

10:13.879 --> 10:16.080
Where am I?

10:16.147 --> 10:17.415
The Ramada Inn of Rumania?

10:17.483 --> 10:18.850
(chuckling)

10:18.917 --> 10:20.651
Latka?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.019
Latka?

10:22.087 --> 10:25.256
Oh, boy, here we go again.

10:25.323 --> 10:28.359
No, honey, Vic-- Vic Ferrari.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.794
And you?

10:29.895 --> 10:32.229
Oh...

10:32.297 --> 10:36.300
Alex told me
      something about this

10:36.368 --> 10:41.372
and darned if he wasn't right.

10:41.439 --> 10:44.075
I think, uh...

10:44.143 --> 10:46.577
Maybe I better go.

10:46.645 --> 10:49.113
Well, uh, that's your
decision, but one thing.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.015
Leave and I'll die.

10:54.753 --> 10:59.623
Well, I mean,
       how can I... stay?

10:59.691 --> 11:02.460
I hardly even know you.

11:02.594 --> 11:04.595
Oh, well, but I know you.

11:04.663 --> 11:06.196
I think I do.

11:06.264 --> 11:08.866
You're smart, independent

11:08.933 --> 11:10.534
and, uh...

11:11.403 --> 11:12.669
You were a daddy's girl.

11:12.737 --> 11:13.837
Am I right?

11:13.906 --> 11:17.775
Well...

11:17.842 --> 11:20.444
How would you know these things?

11:20.512 --> 11:24.748
I mean, Latka doesn't
       know these things.

11:24.816 --> 11:26.917
It's in your eyes
    when you look at a man.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.020
(sighing):
          Oh, brother.

11:36.962 --> 11:39.397
What else?

11:39.465 --> 11:42.400
(chuckles) Playful.

11:42.468 --> 11:46.203
A little bold and, uh,

11:46.271 --> 11:48.573
you have my name tattooed
on your right thigh.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.508
Oh, I don't!

11:50.576 --> 11:51.909
Hey, okay, the
evening's young.

11:54.613 --> 11:59.717
You are very funny
                this way, Latka.

11:59.784 --> 12:02.386
I mean, Vic.

12:02.454 --> 12:07.157
Would you chop me down
if I took a chance?

12:07.226 --> 12:10.261
No, I will not chop you.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.930
Okay, then here goes.

12:14.766 --> 12:17.234
I am completely taken by you

12:17.302 --> 12:18.802
and I want to love you.

12:21.173 --> 12:24.408
Well, in my country,
         there is only one thing

12:24.475 --> 12:26.576
a girl can say to that,

12:26.644 --> 12:29.579
which is one of the
                 reasons I left.

12:36.888 --> 12:39.457
I don't even know
your name.

12:39.524 --> 12:42.293
Simka Dahblitz.

12:43.661 --> 12:45.363
Hello, Simka.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.968
Hello, Vic.

13:09.287 --> 13:12.190
(singing in native language)

13:20.599 --> 13:22.466
LATKA:
                             Ah!

13:26.305 --> 13:28.405
Babycakes!

13:28.506 --> 13:30.274
Simka?

13:30.342 --> 13:33.277
Oh... Latkacakes?

13:34.346 --> 13:36.280
What's going on here?

13:36.348 --> 13:38.282
Why are you still here?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.285
What are you so
                    happy about?

13:41.353 --> 13:43.321
You don't remember?

13:43.388 --> 13:45.590
No.

13:45.657 --> 13:48.025
Well...

13:48.093 --> 13:51.028
Oh, we had a wonderful time.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.998
Oh, you were very funny,

13:54.066 --> 13:57.001
and very charming,

13:57.069 --> 14:00.137
and you said your name was Vic.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.205
Vic!

14:01.273 --> 14:04.208
Ooh, that guy, Vic.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.210
I am not Vic.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.744
I don't even like Vic.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.347
Listen, sit down, please.

14:09.414 --> 14:10.247
Tell me everything.

14:10.315 --> 14:13.217
What did you do with Vic
last night?

14:13.285 --> 14:16.153
Are you sure you
                   want to know?

14:16.220 --> 14:17.421
Yes.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.391
Uh, of course, not if you think
it will destroy me.

14:22.327 --> 14:26.063
Well, I don't know what to say.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.731
Well, for instance,
you can say,

14:27.799 --> 14:29.566
that you were up
all night with him,

14:29.634 --> 14:32.403
and you discussed, uh,
whether the <i>Today</i> show

14:32.470 --> 14:34.405
is better
with Bryant Gumbel.

14:36.908 --> 14:39.176
I cannot say that.

14:39.210 --> 14:40.978
I knew it.

14:43.348 --> 14:45.383
You made love with Vic!

14:46.384 --> 14:48.752
Well, I did, but...

14:48.820 --> 14:50.954
You made love
with another man

14:51.022 --> 14:53.557
right under my nose!

14:54.559 --> 14:58.262
Well, there was no other way.

14:59.998 --> 15:03.700
And besides, that was you.

15:03.735 --> 15:05.536
Did I whimper?

15:05.603 --> 15:08.038
Was I... clumsy?

15:08.073 --> 15:11.342
No, you were wonderful!

15:11.409 --> 15:13.476
Then it wasn't me.

15:14.379 --> 15:16.314
Latka, please.

15:16.381 --> 15:19.016
You have shamed me,

15:19.083 --> 15:21.151
degraded yourself,

15:21.252 --> 15:23.387
disgraced your family,

15:23.455 --> 15:24.888
cheapened your people,

15:24.956 --> 15:26.890
and blemished your planet.

15:30.528 --> 15:33.030
That was not nice!

15:33.098 --> 15:34.231
I'm going!

15:34.332 --> 15:35.566
Good. Go. Good-bye.

15:35.633 --> 15:36.600
I am going.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.402
Good.

15:38.469 --> 15:39.703
Latka!

15:39.771 --> 15:42.673
I hate you and I never want
       to see you again,

15:42.741 --> 15:45.041
and thanks
     for a wonderful night!

15:55.420 --> 15:57.354
Latka.

15:57.422 --> 15:59.389
Latka.

15:59.457 --> 16:02.392
Latka, you've been under
               that cab all day.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.560
Now come on.

16:03.628 --> 16:05.228
Something's happened,
                            huh?

16:05.296 --> 16:07.230
Tell me about it.

16:07.298 --> 16:11.101
Well, Simka says
     she found another man.

16:11.169 --> 16:14.071
Oh... Latka.

16:14.105 --> 16:16.073
Oh...

16:16.141 --> 16:17.908
I can't tell you
how many times

16:17.976 --> 16:19.910
I've had something
like that happen.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.845
Talk to me.

16:21.913 --> 16:22.980
Okay.

16:23.047 --> 16:25.883
She says the other man
            was Vic.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.885
Talk to Alex.

16:31.756 --> 16:33.758
Latka, Latka,
                    let's have--

16:33.825 --> 16:35.092
let's get a cup
                      of coffee.
              No.

16:35.159 --> 16:36.594
Come on, come on, let's
            get a cup of coffee.

16:36.661 --> 16:38.429
I don't want to.
                 Come on, Latka,

16:38.497 --> 16:40.397
let's get a cup
                      of coffee.

16:40.465 --> 16:42.366
No.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.435
Latka...

16:46.370 --> 16:48.872
...I can't believe that a girl
     like Simka would, uh--

16:48.939 --> 16:51.142
could possibly prefer Vic
            to you.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.309
Oh yeah?

16:52.377 --> 16:53.911
Well, look what I found
         in the pockets

16:53.979 --> 16:56.947
of his fancy sports coat.

16:56.981 --> 16:59.015
Airline tickets to Bermuda?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.184
Yeah,

17:00.251 --> 17:01.552
he's taking her away.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.154
Oh, Latka, just 'cause
         he has tickets

17:03.221 --> 17:04.922
doesn't mean she's going.

17:04.989 --> 17:05.756
Oh, yeah?

17:05.823 --> 17:07.290
Look what I found in the pockets

17:07.358 --> 17:09.492
of his velour smoking jacket.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.163
"The trip sounds okay to me.

17:13.231 --> 17:15.999
"I will be at your place tonight
     promptly at 7:00-ish.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.734
Signed Simka."

17:17.801 --> 17:18.935
See?

17:19.002 --> 17:20.770
Vic has more fun in his pockets

17:20.838 --> 17:22.772
than I have in my whole life.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.711
Okay, Latka, look,
maybe Simka prefers Vic,

17:27.779 --> 17:30.981
but I know there are
a lot of women

17:31.015 --> 17:33.817
who are going to prefer your
sweet little innocent qualities.

17:33.885 --> 17:34.851
Oh, really?
      Yeah.

17:34.919 --> 17:36.120
Where are they?
                   I don't know.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.454
I've asked all
                        of them.

17:37.522 --> 17:39.723
Look, women don't like
                 timid, weak men

17:39.790 --> 17:41.325
half as much as
                    they should.

17:44.462 --> 17:46.730
Well, Latka,

17:46.764 --> 17:48.065
is that what you're
                       gonna do?

17:48.132 --> 17:49.232
Huh?

17:49.300 --> 17:50.935
You're gonna just sit
                 there and mope?

17:51.035 --> 17:53.670
No, I'm going to whine
          and snivel.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.907
Okay, fine, terrific.

17:56.975 --> 17:57.975
You lost her.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.477
Give up.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.512
Why don't you stop thinking
       of yourself for a moment?

18:01.579 --> 18:03.047
Why don't you start
              thinking of Simka?

18:03.114 --> 18:06.050
You gonna let her go out
            with a guy like Vic?

18:06.117 --> 18:07.718
Ah.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.821
Hey, wait a minute.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.022
Wait a minute!

18:12.090 --> 18:15.058
Latka, you're
                    responsible.

18:16.561 --> 18:18.495
You got them together!

18:18.563 --> 18:20.464
They met through you.

18:20.531 --> 18:21.899
Wait a minute.

18:21.966 --> 18:23.366
You are right.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.535
I am responsible.

18:25.603 --> 18:29.573
Yes, I-I have to save her
from that two-bit bossa nova.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.408
All right!

18:31.476 --> 18:33.410
Oh, I am going to go.

18:34.712 --> 18:36.647
And-And if he won't listen
        to good manners,

18:36.714 --> 18:38.649
I'm going to have to get rough.

18:38.716 --> 18:41.351
I would hate to be
         in his shoes.

18:48.526 --> 18:50.527
(knocking on door)

18:58.436 --> 19:00.871
Hello, Simka.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.940
Hello, Latka.

19:02.974 --> 19:05.909
You were expecting someone else?

19:05.977 --> 19:07.911
Maybe someone smooth?

19:09.480 --> 19:12.249
May I enter your house

19:12.317 --> 19:14.251
and sit down on
                      something?

19:14.318 --> 19:16.286
Yes, that would be pleasant.

19:26.831 --> 19:28.766
There is something
very important

19:28.833 --> 19:30.267
I want to tell you.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.269
Okay, first of all,

19:32.337 --> 19:35.105
I am sorry that I got mad
at you the other day.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.941
That's okay, Latka.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.944
I accept your sorriness.

19:41.012 --> 19:42.346
Thank you.

19:42.413 --> 19:44.215
Second of all,

19:44.282 --> 19:45.716
you cannot see Vic anymore.

19:45.783 --> 19:48.785
He is a terrible,
awful person.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.954
At least he is happy with me.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.756
He has a lot more
       to be happy about.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.430
There is one other thing
I want you to know.

19:59.497 --> 20:02.065
Ever since you have come back,

20:02.133 --> 20:04.067
I don't know what I'm doing.

20:04.135 --> 20:06.903
I cannot sleep, I cannot eat,

20:06.971 --> 20:09.106
and my work is suffering.

20:09.173 --> 20:11.442
Men have gone to almost
certain injury

20:11.509 --> 20:13.444
in the cabs.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.211
So, please,

20:15.279 --> 20:17.915
don't-don't go to Bermuda
with Vic,

20:17.982 --> 20:21.218
because...

20:21.252 --> 20:24.355
Because what, Latka?

20:24.422 --> 20:26.624
Well, because--

20:26.691 --> 20:28.792
oh, I-I don't know
         how to say it.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.527
Uh, uh,

20:30.595 --> 20:32.496
well, you know...

20:34.599 --> 20:37.333
...I...

20:41.005 --> 20:42.439
(as Vic): Simka, baby!

20:42.506 --> 20:43.973
Oh no, not Vic.

20:44.041 --> 20:46.643
I want to hear what Latka wants
          to tell me.

20:46.711 --> 20:48.311
I'm listening, Latka.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.747
Simka, it's so good
to see you.

20:50.815 --> 20:52.883
You know,
this is crazy.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.786
I just realized
how much I missed you.

20:55.853 --> 20:58.822
Now I know what it feels like
to really care.

20:58.889 --> 21:00.257
Oh, well. Hey, come on,

21:00.324 --> 21:02.025
we're missing valuable
sack time.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.894
Come on.
                   Oh!

21:05.129 --> 21:08.565
I think all you want is
              physical pleasure.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.066
Oh, come on now,

21:10.134 --> 21:11.902
why would I want something
           like that?

21:11.969 --> 21:13.369
(chuckles)

21:15.473 --> 21:17.274
Latka,

21:17.341 --> 21:20.110
if you are in there...

21:20.177 --> 21:22.579
come back to me.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.847
Please.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.015
Yes, yes!

21:25.083 --> 21:27.017
No, no.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.854
Come with me to Bermuda,
and good news,

21:30.922 --> 21:32.856
we're gonna fly...

21:32.924 --> 21:35.592
business class.

21:35.659 --> 21:39.563
I don't want to go to
           Bermuda anymore, Vic.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.298
I want Latka.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.734
Uh, there must be an acoustic
problem in here.

21:44.802 --> 21:47.737
Uh, I could have sworn I heard
you make kissing-off noises

21:47.805 --> 21:49.439
to Captain Joy!

21:50.374 --> 21:53.576
Ya.

21:53.678 --> 21:56.747
Well, if that means I
             want you to go away

21:56.815 --> 21:59.883
so that Latka will
                      come back,

21:59.984 --> 22:03.754
then you're hitting nail with
           your head, buddy boy!

22:05.389 --> 22:07.824
You know, I don't think you
realize what you're saying.

22:07.892 --> 22:09.526
Let me just explain
something to you.

22:09.594 --> 22:12.028
If I walk out that door,

22:12.096 --> 22:14.598
I'm never coming back.

22:20.671 --> 22:22.606
(sighs)

22:22.673 --> 22:24.407
Bye, Vic.

22:34.485 --> 22:36.420
Okay.

22:36.487 --> 22:38.355
Okay.

22:39.557 --> 22:42.926
No tears, no bum feelings,

22:42.993 --> 22:45.863
no blame,

22:45.930 --> 22:47.698
no fault insurance.

22:48.632 --> 22:50.233
I'm just glad

22:50.301 --> 22:52.302
that I got to spend
a part of my life

22:52.370 --> 22:54.171
in part of your life.

22:54.238 --> 22:56.139
You blew it, baby.

22:56.206 --> 22:57.574
(clicks tongue)

22:57.641 --> 22:58.808
Pow.

23:11.589 --> 23:13.189
(as Latka):
That's right.
Get out of here.

23:13.257 --> 23:15.191
And if you ever come
near my woman again,

23:15.259 --> 23:17.126
I will call you a name!

23:19.030 --> 23:21.164
Simka, there is something
I want to tell you,

23:21.232 --> 23:22.332
right here and now,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.802
and no, I'm not going
to beating on the bush.

23:28.239 --> 23:30.774
I...

23:30.841 --> 23:33.377
I love you!

23:33.444 --> 23:35.078
Good deal!

23:35.146 --> 23:37.080
Me, too!

23:42.353 --> 23:43.987
Vic?

23:44.054 --> 23:46.490
No, it is me.

23:46.557 --> 23:48.458
Wow, Latka!

23:59.237 --> 24:01.738
(theme song playing)

24:25.063 --> 24:26.296
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:26.364 --> 24:27.664
