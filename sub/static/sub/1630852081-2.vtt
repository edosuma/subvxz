00:11.011 --> 00:15.306
<i>'Twas a time close to Christmas</i>
<i>And through strands of twinkle lights</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.643
<i>Furnaces were cranked up</i>
<i>To 2,000 Fahrenheits</i>

00:19.227 --> 00:21.771
<i>Stockings had been hung</i>
<i>In the hot shop with care</i>

00:21.855 --> 00:24.941
<i>In hopes that glassblowers</i>
<i>Soon would be there</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
Ho ho ho!

00:27.110 --> 00:29.821
<i>Then Santa called out</i>
<i>From up and above</i>

00:29.904 --> 00:32.741
<i>To artists we all know and do love</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:33.908
This is it.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.869
I want to win so badly.

00:35.952 --> 00:39.664
<i>On, Andi, on, Cat,</i>
<i>Edgar, Nao, and Alexander</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:42.542
<i>There is no time for you to meander</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:43.877
Best feeling ever.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.130
<i>For a chance to rewrite</i>
<i>Your own glass story</i>

00:47.213 --> 00:48.214
Sick.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.342
<i>This Christmas</i>
<i>You'll blow for all the glory</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:53.303
Go big or go home!

00:53.386 --> 00:54.304
I'm Bobby Berk.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.473
Prepare to be blown away for the holidays.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.850
This is<i> Blown Away: Christmas</i>.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.868
Good morning, glassblowers.
Welcome back to the holiday hot shop

01:16.951 --> 01:18.787
and to your second challenge.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.247
Like, okay, I'm still in it.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.125
I definitely feel like
I have a target on my back

01:24.209 --> 01:25.919
'cause I won the first challenge.

01:26.002 --> 01:29.798
You all know what's at stake,
$20,000.

01:30.632 --> 01:34.886
Not only will you receive
$10,000 in cash for yourself,

01:34.969 --> 01:39.057
you will get an additional $10,000
to donate to the charity of your choice.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.185
That amount of money
could be transformative.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.979
I hope everybody has on
their stretchy pants,

01:45.063 --> 01:48.483
because your second challenge
is all about festive food.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.361
Food? I just did food.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.445
Cue the doors.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.741
-Oh my.
-Whoa.

01:58.118 --> 02:03.665
I see, like, a banquet table
overflowing with this feast.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.586
There's, like, a turkey and
some kind of decorative dessert tree.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.798
The first thing that stuck out
was that pineapple ham.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.425
I don't want to make
a pineapple ham.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.220
Turkey, stuffing, sweet potato casserole,

02:17.303 --> 02:20.723
fruitcake are all
traditional holiday fare.

02:21.599 --> 02:25.270
And ooh
that jiggly cranberry jelly in a can.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.442
See what I have to work with over here?

02:33.736 --> 02:36.364
But this isn't about us,
this is about you.

02:37.282 --> 02:41.244
We want you to recreate
your favorite holiday food in glass.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.999
Whether you make one dish
or an entire spread, it's up to you.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.002
And I encourage you
to be ambitious.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.004
Aim high and push yourselves technically.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.383
And the artist that does not blow us away
will leave the hot shop for good.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.264
You'll have four hours
to design, create and present

03:01.347 --> 03:03.266
your mouthwatering masterpiece.

03:03.850 --> 03:08.229
You'll be judged on your design,
technical skill, and realism.

03:08.313 --> 03:13.276
So scale, color, texture, proportion,
all of those are going to be important.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.570
All right. Is everyone ready?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.615
Your time starts now!

03:28.166 --> 03:31.753
In order for me to win, I have to do
something different from other people.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.674
This time, I'm thinking to make
traditional Japanese festive food.

03:36.758 --> 03:41.554
We call it<i> osechi.</i> This is something
that we eat for New Year.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.266
I think Japan has
the best food in the world.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.019
I will try to make it
so colorful and pretty.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
I love to eat. I love to eat.

03:52.315 --> 03:56.236
So this is me getting a second helping
of food and not finishing it.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.447
So you got your turkey leg.

04:00.156 --> 04:03.076
My girlfriend's always like,
"Dude, you never finish your food."

04:03.159 --> 04:06.412
"You always think you're gonna.
Stop flexing. Don't get something big."

04:06.496 --> 04:09.499
My eyes are definitely
way bigger than my stomach.

04:11.751 --> 04:18.007
I'm thinking about this <i>glogg</i> party that
I go to each year with my best friend.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.134
It's like a Swedish smorgasbord.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.971
The party takes place
around Christmastime.

04:23.054 --> 04:27.558
I'm thinking specifically of this,
like, stinky, sour herring that they have.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.812
And then they have
this big, kind of, wheel of cheese.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.982
To me, it seems like an unusual pairing.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.530
The inspiration is being
part of something bigger than yourself.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.615
So that's kind of what I want
to represent,

04:42.699 --> 04:44.867
and I like the stinky fish.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.705
I am making a ploughman's platter,

04:48.788 --> 04:52.667
which is basically
a less fancy charcuterie board.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.503
We use it as, like,
our big Christmas Eve dinner.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.799
And it's one of my family's, like,
favorite meals in the whole wide world.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.218
It's so simple,
but it's one of the only times

05:02.302 --> 05:05.430
you're like,
"I can buy a $13 piece of cheese."

05:06.597 --> 05:09.851
I think the most important part
of this whole challenge is realism.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.854
Like, you want to be able
to walk up to it and be like, "Mmm."

05:13.438 --> 05:16.232
"How do I make this not look cartoony?"

05:17.567 --> 05:18.568
We'll find out!

05:22.405 --> 05:25.116
This should be, like,
a wristband kind of day, I feel.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.411
Where is the black?
Oh, there we go.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.958
All right, so we're gonna do
the turkey leg first.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.335
I love holiday food.

05:35.418 --> 05:39.505
The two best holidays are food holidays,
basically, Thanksgiving and Christmas.

05:39.589 --> 05:44.010
Well, turkey in general is my favorite
part of any festive dinner feast.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.055
Oh, what's up, glass? I missed you.

05:47.138 --> 05:51.142
In Japan, a lot of people order
a bucket of fried chicken for Christmas,

05:51.809 --> 05:54.437
but my mom never allowed me to eat it.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.898
That's great.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.691
Ho ho ho!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.619
Glassblowers have holiday potlucks.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.205
We always have, like,
kind of a goblet exchange,

06:12.288 --> 06:14.624
then we drink wine that,
usually, someone else made.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.091
I'm getting started making this,
like… It's like a mason jar.

06:23.174 --> 06:26.302
I'm Jewish,
so my family didn't celebrate Christmas,

06:26.386 --> 06:30.014
but I love trying out
other people's holiday food.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.183
Awesome.

06:32.266 --> 06:37.939
I definitely feel a sense
of nurturing and warmth for being fed.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.442
So I guess you could say
I'm an emotional eater.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.862
That said, I'm stoked
about what I'm making, though.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.498
I'd say your biggest burn
on this show ever

06:55.581 --> 06:59.293
is when you said somebody's piece
looked like it came from a gift shop.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.088
Hey, I'm not knocking you,
that's what you're here for.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.384
How do you avoid
going towards gift-shop tacky?

07:06.467 --> 07:09.095
With Christmas stuff,
I think it's hard.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.057
There is a lot of room
for, like, being a little classier

07:13.141 --> 07:16.644
and bringing an elevated aesthetic
sensibility to what you're making.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.688
All right, ready?

07:18.771 --> 07:22.024
In terms of glass and realism, it's hard.

07:22.108 --> 07:26.487
I have to work in a lot of techniques
that I'm not super comfortable with.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.739
There we go.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.325
There is so much pressure
in this challenge

07:31.409 --> 07:34.662
because I have to make
super-realistic things

07:34.745 --> 07:38.749
when I'm notorious
for not being realistic at all.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.462
-Turn this way a little bit. Yeah.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.090
When I heard realism was
one of the criteria, I was stoked.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.093
That is my biggest focus for glass art.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.972
I'm just using this leather stamp
as a texture tool.

07:53.055 --> 07:55.516
It has these little bubbles in it,
and you can, like,

07:55.600 --> 07:58.227
get, like, a really cool
reptile texture with it.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.189
Whoo!

08:01.272 --> 08:05.401
-That's some hot competition right there.
-I'm just adding a little bit of powder.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.029
So I'm sifting it with black
and a little bit of amber,

08:08.112 --> 08:10.490
just to kind of give it
that cooked look to it.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.949
Sick.

08:12.867 --> 08:16.537
My time to shine.
That's a turkey leg, dude.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.962
Look at the side there.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.718
I think Nao is…
I was wondering what she was making,

08:30.801 --> 08:33.179
but I see with the fins,
it's a cute little shrimp.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.431
It is a little shrimp.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.017
I never made anything that is realistic.

08:38.100 --> 08:42.730
So, last challenge and this challenge,
I'm actually doing something very unusual.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.692
I consider myself a glassblower
instead of glass sculptor.

08:47.193 --> 08:51.030
Everything that I do is very abstract
and, like, simpler shapes,

08:51.113 --> 08:53.574
a lot of spheres, you know,
like, some blown forms.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.869
But I've been having, actually,
a great time making this kind of thing.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.371
Okay, flash.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.666
I just have to spend
a little bit more time with each piece

09:01.749 --> 09:04.252
to make sure that
all the details are good.

09:04.335 --> 09:08.839
Like, texture and color is, I think,
the important part to make it realistic.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.175
One piece done.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.814
-Nice.
-Thanks.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.857
All right, grab it.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.320
Coming in with no win,
it was kind of like,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.532
"Step it up, Edgar. Come on.
You know you're a good glassblower."

09:35.491 --> 09:37.159
-Killer.
-Thank you.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.162
Just gather slow,
so it's nice and even.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.416
One of the challenging things
about taking that little wrap

09:43.499 --> 09:46.836
is the distance you hold
the glass from your piece

09:46.919 --> 09:48.713
and the speed that you turn

09:48.796 --> 09:52.049
will affect the thickness
of the line being trailed on.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.135
This one might not be worth keeping.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.555
You might say that
I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.473
I'd sure like a win.

09:59.557 --> 10:04.103
I mean, I guess, at the end of the day,
most important thing is just not losing.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.232
When I see myself
getting into that place of, like,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.067
"This has to be perfect!"

10:10.735 --> 10:11.736
And it's just like,

10:11.819 --> 10:14.488
"Shut up. Just make glass.
It's gonna be good."

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
One down, more to go.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.828
All right, Santa's elves!
We got two hours left!

10:20.911 --> 10:21.829
All right, blow.

10:21.912 --> 10:22.997


10:23.080 --> 10:25.207
I want to win this whole thing

10:25.291 --> 10:28.002
to have money in a charity
and my bank.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.170
All right, stop.

10:29.879 --> 10:34.175
So ten years ago,
in Japan, we had an earthquake

10:34.258 --> 10:39.388
that caused tsunami and that damaged
not only Japan, but all over the world.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.352
My charity is
International Rescue Committee,

10:44.435 --> 10:48.356
because they provide
a space for people to feel safe

10:48.439 --> 10:50.608
when they have emergency situation.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.776
How do you think?

10:51.859 --> 10:54.820
-It's a pretty big square.
-It might not be enough?

10:54.904 --> 11:00.117
Money can do a lot of things, and $10,000,
if that goes to something for good,

11:00.201 --> 11:01.702
I'm more than happy about that.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.246
My hands are so weak.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.424
Pull a little bit. That's good.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.386
We're making a pie slice.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.970
Pumpkin pie, pumpkin.

11:20.763 --> 11:25.226
So we're just trying to point this up,
get a nice triangle taper to it.

11:25.309 --> 11:29.105
Pumpkin, apple, blackberry.
Top three pies.

11:29.188 --> 11:34.026
My parents usually… They'll cook,
like, small things, like appetizers.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.154
I was adopted, but my mom was,
like, my biggest supporter.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.322
She's also an artist.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.534
Definitely a big reason
why I am a glassblower today.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.995
And then pull a little bit.
A little bit more.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.914
Sick!

11:48.999 --> 11:50.751
I really want this stuff to look…

11:51.460 --> 11:54.171
Look like you could buy it
off the shelf in the supermarket.

11:54.255 --> 11:58.134
I want to build this fish
from the inside out.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.427
Straight up and down.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.304
So when you slice 'em,
there's a cross section,

12:02.388 --> 12:04.724
and you can see
the color of what's inside.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.436
So I'm gonna have to spend
half of the time

12:08.519 --> 12:11.814
just gathering up the color
and melting it down

12:11.897 --> 12:17.570
to set up this, kind of,
complicated fish-body situation.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.155
"Complicated fish-body situ…"

12:19.238 --> 12:22.032
Also my nickname in high school,
by the way.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.703
I was really happy
when they stopped calling me that.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.125
And stop.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.962
All right, so I'm gonna keep this and
I'm gonna put this in a mold next time.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.299
So from the very first time
I saw season one of <i>Blown Away</i>,

12:38.382 --> 12:41.427
it really stood out to me
the physical toll

12:41.510 --> 12:43.220
that this must take on one's body.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.264
-How you doing?

12:45.347 --> 12:48.017
I'm doing fine 'cause I'm up here.
I'm not down there.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.978
Glassblowing is also
really hard on your eyes.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.773
You're looking into
a bright glory hole all the time.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.193
Sometimes people wear
specially tinted glasses for that.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.778
Just drop it level.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.488
Cat actually has

13:00.571 --> 13:03.616
a hereditary disease
where she's losing her vision.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.660
My eyes have gotten worse
since the last time I've been here.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.332
It started off as blurry,
like a funhouse mirror,

13:11.415 --> 13:15.544
and now it is just
gray and white kind of fuzz.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.671
So, I'm going to hand this
over to you.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.631
Go ahead.

13:19.131 --> 13:19.965
Floosh.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.052
Glass is just so much of my life

13:23.135 --> 13:27.056
that I honestly can't really
imagine my life without it.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.268
So, what did we learn today?
How to make the rind of a cheese.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.354
I love cheese.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.360
-Ready?
-Yep!

13:41.153 --> 13:42.530
Oh. What is she doing?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.241
Okay, blow.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.409
And blow.

13:48.869 --> 13:54.458
I look over, and I notice Nao
blowing this giant, like, box thing.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.629
If one of the little walls
falls down,

13:58.712 --> 14:01.757
it's all gonna go wrong.
So I'm just like, "Just stay together."

14:02.842 --> 14:04.260
All right, stop it.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.765
Thank you.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.310
Best feeling ever.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.020
-Last flash.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.647
Pshew! Awesomeness.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.023
She did it!

14:18.732 --> 14:19.733
Okay.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.697
I just hope that
all the color comes out as I want,

14:24.780 --> 14:27.950
and I'm not gonna know until
glass cools off to room temperature.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.452
-Great job. Thank you so much.
-No problem.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.454
All right, keep going.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.624
Perfect.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.127
Go ahead and flip it over
and give a little shake.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.006
Okay, good. Right.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.259
Go ahead, heat up,
and next time you gonna dip in here.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.469
Ah.

14:48.137 --> 14:52.266
I'm making the dinner plate that
all the food's gonna be just sitting on.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.644
I'm a sculptor. So I'm not--
I don't really make a lot of plates.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.063
You're taking this bowl,
and you're gonna open it up

14:58.147 --> 15:01.483
using heat and centrifugal force,
just by spinning it really fast.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.360
It's cool. It's fun.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.948
Juicy.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.743
Go ahead, take a heat.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.078
-Hi, Nao.
-Hi.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.246
How are you doing?

15:14.330 --> 15:16.624
Oh. Pretty intense.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.251
-You do seem a little stressed today.
-Yeah.

15:19.835 --> 15:23.297
I just know that I have more potential,
and getting out of my comfort zone,

15:23.380 --> 15:26.717
it only makes me a better person,
and I'm all about that.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.303
There are a lot of detail
that I'm still worried about,

15:29.386 --> 15:31.722
but I'm doing my best.

15:31.805 --> 15:32.890
That's all I know.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.142
-All right. Good luck.
-Thanks.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.940
Pretty good. It looks good.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.109
-Guys, 30 minutes left in the challenge.
-Wow.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.111
-Thirty minutes.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.448
Now we're making the cutting board
that everything's gonna go on.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.493
I'm gathering this giant mass of glass,

15:52.576 --> 15:56.038
which is even heavier because
there's not, like, an air pocket in it.

15:56.121 --> 16:01.001
This is risky because I only have enough
energy and time to make one of these.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.588
If I break it,
all the food's just gonna be on nothing.

16:05.172 --> 16:08.467
Can you angle the marver,
so I don't have to carry it all the way,

16:08.550 --> 16:10.177
so I can just kind of go over here?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.388
I'm risking it. Watch out.
Real fast.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.306


16:14.390 --> 16:15.307


16:15.849 --> 16:17.351
Can I stand on it?

16:17.434 --> 16:18.268
Whoo!

16:18.352 --> 16:19.186
Nope.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.771
I can't get the right support

16:20.854 --> 16:24.024
to press it down.
It's not getting flat enough.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.985
I don't have this upper body strength.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.821
Yeah, I'm gonna need
to stand up on the marver.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.621
As soon as I got up there, I was like,
"This might be a really bad idea."

16:38.330 --> 16:41.041
I'm not worried about my $100 shoes.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.876
It should've crumbled beneath my feet.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.754
But I did it, and I didn't die.
No one got hurt.

16:46.422 --> 16:50.259
Everything I made is an experiment,
and I got lucky.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.138
The hardest part is done. Thank you.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.306
-Whoo!

16:56.390 --> 16:57.516
I'm gonna bomb it now.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.310
All right, guys,
Christmas dinner must be on the table

17:00.394 --> 17:02.146
in 15 minutes.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.023
Time is running.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.275
Okay, I'm gonna focus.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.068
-Grab it.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.195
So I'm the first
to finish again, obviously.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.574
-Oh, yeah, baby.
-Nice one.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.492
I am feeling the time crunch.

17:15.576 --> 17:19.121
I'm trying to make a big wheel of cheese.
It goes with the stinky herring.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.124
Do me a favor
and just put a little sprinkling.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.293
It's the biggest size for it
we have there.

17:24.376 --> 17:29.965
It didn't look bad, but, like, the spots
look, kind of, too perfectly round.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.301
All right, artists. Three-minute warning!

17:32.384 --> 17:35.137
Get your pieces
in the annealer right away.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.389
One more? I can do one more?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.809
All right,
let me see a paddle again.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.811
We're just gonna flatten it.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.648
The very last piece.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.152
Whoop!

17:50.778 --> 17:52.029
Oh, jeez.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.864
Let me get your door.

17:53.947 --> 17:54.865
Great.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.992
Dope. Good job. Proud of you!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.203
Thank you. Good job.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.330
I hope it's enough.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.638
For this challenge, we had
to make a dinner that looked appetizing,

18:17.721 --> 18:21.725
make it realistic,
and express a good holiday feel.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.396
I hope it's enough
to wow the evaluators.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.359
Only thing I can do is
to keep fighting so that I won't regret,

18:30.442 --> 18:32.694
and create something true to myself.

18:34.446 --> 18:38.700
This piece definitely shows me
that I'm pushing myself to my limit.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.746
I feel good about
what I've produced.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.457
It's one of the things I like
about doing this competition.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.336
I'm kind of pushed to do stuff that's
really outside of what I'd normally do.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.052
Beautiful gallery full of food.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.973
I don't know about you,
but this is making me hungry.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.394
So this is Nao's piece.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.604
"Each food in the box
has a special meaning."

19:07.688 --> 19:11.108
"The pink of the fish cake symbolizes joy,

19:11.191 --> 19:13.110
and the white is purity,

19:13.193 --> 19:15.028
and the shrimp stand for long life."

19:16.363 --> 19:18.240
The elephant in the room is the chip.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.661
I kind of have a bigger problem with
the interior of the box and the color.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.373
I feel like she could have had
a much more intense red.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.917
-Do you see a lot of ambition in this?
-I do.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.296
A lot of different techniques.
A lot of different elements.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.631
It's painstaking.
It's a big time commitment.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.011
The thing I love about this piece
is its simplicity from the outside,

19:39.094 --> 19:41.471
but then its complexity on the inside.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.184
It really captures
the visual qualities of Japanese food.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.355
All right,
so this is Edgar's piece.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.733
I really love the humor in it, honestly.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.944
I mean, I feel like it does
sort of capture, like, a big holiday feast

19:56.028 --> 19:59.198
and that you go and get seconds,
even when you really don't need them.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.868
I think he's captured, like,
the pumpkin pie really well.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
-But…
-But,

20:04.203 --> 20:06.705
I don't think the fork is,
like, really that well done.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.458
-This drumstick looks burnt.
-Mm. Mm-hm.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.960
-I think it should be more brown.
-Yep.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.921
Yeah. And a bit more detailed.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.342
Instead of doing two separate pieces,
he should have combined these two pieces,

20:18.425 --> 20:20.636
made a true drumstick
with the bone sticking out.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.929
Yeah. Agreed.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.891
A bit let down on the realism spectrum.
Other than that, I think it's great.

20:25.974 --> 20:26.808
Mm-hm.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
Cat's piece.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.189
"Every Christmas Eve,
Cat's family celebrates

20:32.272 --> 20:35.567
by putting on matching PJs,
watching Christmas movies,

20:35.651 --> 20:38.403
and feasting on a ploughman's platter."

20:38.487 --> 20:40.739
-I love it. Yeah.
-I love it, too.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.909
The texture on the strawberries
and the brie, and, like,

20:43.992 --> 20:45.661
you know exactly what everything is.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.830
-The realism… Yeah.
-Yeah. The bread is amazing.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.915
What's that, though?

20:49.998 --> 20:51.416
I think it's called a cracker.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.835
I'm surprised she went
out of the way

20:53.919 --> 20:57.047
to make another piece
that is not part of food.

20:57.130 --> 21:01.426
She didn't need to, but I think it really
kind of gives a sense of, like, excess.

21:01.510 --> 21:07.349
The only thing I could pick out is
the color of the grapes is slightly off.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.977
It could be maybe
a little bit translucent

21:10.060 --> 21:12.437
or a little less intense purple.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
Agreed.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.442
So this is Alexander's piece.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.613
"Every December, Alexander's best friend
invites him to a Swedish <i>glogg</i> potluck."

21:21.697 --> 21:24.324
"Similar to the unexpected pairing
of unusual flavors,

21:24.408 --> 21:27.619
this party welcomes people
of different religions and nationalities

21:27.703 --> 21:29.705
to become a part of a new tradition."

21:29.788 --> 21:31.290
-I love that.
-Really great.

21:31.873 --> 21:34.084
The flesh looks really cool.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.044
-It's got, like…
-Marbling.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.047
…marbling and fat in there.
I think it's really pretty.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.427
I think the effect even on the outside
of this fish is absolutely beautiful.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.221
Yeah! The jar is really pretty accurate.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.474
There's really not much
for me to pick apart.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.684
But where's the cheese?

21:51.184 --> 21:53.687
Was there breakage? Did something happen?

21:54.271 --> 21:55.772
-I don't know.
-Uh-oh.

21:55.856 --> 21:56.982
We'll find out.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.325
That thought's always
in the back of my head,

22:06.408 --> 22:07.868
that I'm gonna go home.

22:07.951 --> 22:11.371
I'm pretty hungry for a win, honestly.
Thinking I'm gonna get it.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.373
I want to win.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.710
There weren't that many of us
to start with,

22:16.793 --> 22:19.838
so, like, there's not
a lot of fat to trim.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.381
Welcome back.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.259
Today, your art definitely gave us
some food for thought.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.430
I think you guys really
hit the marks on realism,

22:28.513 --> 22:30.724
and it was also really enlightening

22:30.807 --> 22:34.061
to see all the different
holiday traditions that you celebrate.

22:34.644 --> 22:38.690
Cat, tell me about the level of ambition
that you went into this challenge with.

22:39.274 --> 22:43.737
I have been told so many times
that I do cartoony things.

22:44.321 --> 22:47.324
So I went for the most realistic
that I could possibly make.

22:47.824 --> 22:51.370
We both were really impressed
with the realism.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.704
Not cartoony at all.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.248
The only thing
I would have done differently is,

22:55.332 --> 22:59.294
the cracker, to me, wasn't up to
the same par as everything else.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.213
But I tried so hard!

23:01.296 --> 23:03.673
So, Edgar,
we'd love to hear more about your piece.

23:04.257 --> 23:07.052
I kind of chose
a specific time of the meal.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.304
The fork marks at the end of the pie,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.932
so it kind of shows that
you took your first bite of pie,

23:12.015 --> 23:15.060
but you're sitting for a little bit
before you finish it all.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.062
My favorite part was definitely the bone.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.731
-It was finished to perfection.
-Thank you.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.527
My disappointment in the piece was
that I feel that you should've combined

23:23.610 --> 23:25.695
the bone and the turkey leg together.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.865
The other thing about the leg
was it looks a little dark.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.034
It seems like a little on the burnt side.

23:31.118 --> 23:35.997
I used amber. I did four rolls,
and I honestly should have done two.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.209
Did you think about
trying to remake the turkey leg?

23:39.292 --> 23:41.753
I didn't get around to that.
Kind of forgot, honestly.

23:42.337 --> 23:44.089
-All right. Thanks, Edgar.
-Thank you.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.801
So, Nao, how do you think you did
as far as realism?

23:47.884 --> 23:49.594
I love how the color play out,

23:49.678 --> 23:53.974
and I love that I'm able to bring
our tradition onto this kind of platform.

23:54.057 --> 23:59.980
At the same time, I feel it's not really
on the level that I'm proud of myself.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.940
Think it's good enough
to win the challenge?

24:04.943 --> 24:08.697
I'd love to redo the box,
if I had a chance.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.781
Thank you.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.783
Alexander.

24:12.325 --> 24:17.497
One of the things we were expecting to see
based on your artist statement was cheese.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.959
-Yeah--
-But it seems that you cut the cheese.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.336
Thank you for that.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.757
Um, I just edited. I made it, it exists.

24:27.841 --> 24:33.346
I was so excited with all of the little
visual details going on with the fish,

24:33.430 --> 24:36.516
and then I just, like,
wanted all the attention on that.

24:36.600 --> 24:40.520
That was another reason why we're like,
"Hmm, where's the other part?"

24:40.604 --> 24:42.898
-Because what you have is amazing.
-Thank you.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.442
One thing that I'll point out
from a visual standpoint,

24:45.525 --> 24:49.905
the way you've styled it to one side
looks like it's missing something.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.031
Yeah.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.074
I would've styled it
with it in the center.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.161
It's the star of the show.
There's no room for anything else.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.872
It being off to the side like that
leaves me wanting more.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.834
So, you've all given us
some things to chew on.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.921
Katherine and I
are going to go deliberate.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.052
I'm a little nervous,
a bit of butterflies.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.264
-They all have some flaws.
-It looks underwhelming.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.392
It does look underwhelming
compared to the others.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.937
It always sucks
to have a bad day in glass,

25:22.020 --> 25:25.065
but usually, it doesn't mean
you're gonna get sent home.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.861
I will be infuriated with myself
if I go home on this challenge.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.113
I feel a little bit tense.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.365
I'm not super confident.

25:38.453 --> 25:42.165
Today, you guys all delivered your version
of the perfect holiday comfort food.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.628
But there was one piece that
definitely stood out above the rest.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.632
Today's "Best in Blow" goes to…

25:52.676 --> 25:54.553
-Cat.
-Awesome!

25:54.636 --> 25:57.264
-"Best in Blow," baby!

25:57.347 --> 26:00.100
Killed it on the realism. Not cartoony.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.851
Two in a row.

26:03.436 --> 26:04.729
Congratulations.

26:04.813 --> 26:08.024
You are still in the running
for the $20,000 grand prize

26:08.108 --> 26:11.319
and the title
of<i> Blown Away: Christmas</i> Champion.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.237
Thank you.

26:12.320 --> 26:17.200
I, for the first time in my life,
feel confident in what I'm doing.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.581
And now for the artist
that did not blow us away.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.962
I'm sorry, Edgar.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.258
The time has come
to take your stocking from the mantel

26:33.341 --> 26:34.551
and leave the hot shop.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.553
-Thank you, guys.
-You fought a good fight.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.138
-Appreciate it.
-Mmm.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.222
Thank you.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.058
It was great to be back,
a great opportunity, no matter what.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.811
I'm really proud of myself.
I think I did great.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.354
Thank you all.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.189
-Edgar!
-Edgar!

26:48.857 --> 26:49.733
Whoo!

26:51.026 --> 26:54.154
Joy to all, and to all a good night.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.284
All right, guys. Two down, two more to go.

26:59.868 --> 27:02.954
So I wanna see you
right back here, but with bells on.
