00:02.467 --> 00:03.500
- VERNON: Previously
on "Still The King"--

00:03.600 --> 00:04.667
- Surprise!

00:04.767 --> 00:05.967
- Trayne, what are you
doing here?

00:06.067 --> 00:07.633
- I'm playing Vernon Brown
in the movie.

00:07.733 --> 00:10.033
It's about you scamming that
church, being a deadbeat dad.

00:10.133 --> 00:12.000
- They're gonna make you
look like a horrible person.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.700
- Just a fly on the wall.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.433
Keep that shrimp away from me.

00:15.533 --> 00:17.767
Alright, I got terrible
allergies, and I'm gonna

00:17.867 --> 00:20.467
swell up like that purple girl
from "Willy Wonka."

00:20.567 --> 00:22.100
- I really need someone
who like actually cares.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.200
- Please, don't let
this young lady down.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.033
- Just been so focused
on this baby

00:27.133 --> 00:28.967
I haven't been paying
her enough attention.

00:29.067 --> 00:31.133
You make a much better version
of you than Trayne does.

00:34.633 --> 00:38.567
- *

00:45.233 --> 00:48.833
- [crash]

00:54.567 --> 00:59.600
- [explosion]

00:59.700 --> 01:03.800
- *

01:15.733 --> 01:17.867
- [coughing]

01:20.767 --> 01:24.167
- Need a hand, buddy.

01:24.267 --> 01:25.467
This kills me.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.167
You were my best friend,
Vernon Brown.

01:28.267 --> 01:31.200
Unfortunately, my boss,
Lady Justice,

01:31.300 --> 01:33.300
says that we can't
hang out anymore.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.667
- Doily, I can explain.
- Save it.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.900
You broke my heart,
and worst of all,

01:38.067 --> 01:41.567
you broke the law.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.400
- Can I at least say goodbye?

01:44.500 --> 01:47.967
- * When I look at you

01:48.067 --> 01:50.467
* It's like looking at me

01:50.567 --> 01:52.333
- Make it quick, then we go.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.567
- * If I were you

01:54.667 --> 01:55.800
*

01:55.900 --> 01:58.133
* Then I'd be you

01:58.233 --> 01:59.700
- I'm sorry, Charlotte.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.067
- You got that right.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.833
You're nothing more than
a scandal-ridden, washed-up,

02:03.933 --> 02:05.900
one-hit wonder who was
kicked out of country music

02:06.067 --> 02:09.600
only to emerge 20 years later
as an Elvis impersonator,

02:09.700 --> 02:11.600
who's now pretending
to be a minister.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.067
- All those things are true.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.333
But you left out one thing.

02:14.433 --> 02:19.133
I'm also...your daddy.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.667
- So I'm just
supposed to forgive you

02:20.767 --> 02:23.267
after you spent your life
doing all the wrong things?

02:23.367 --> 02:24.733
- For all the right reasons.

02:24.833 --> 02:28.067
- *

02:28.167 --> 02:30.067
- I love you, Dad.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.600
- I love you, baby girl.

02:31.700 --> 02:37.133
- *

02:37.233 --> 02:41.933
- [crying]

02:42.067 --> 02:43.133
- Hold on, no, no!

02:43.233 --> 02:44.300
Cut!

02:44.400 --> 02:45.633
No way, this is horse [bleep].

02:45.733 --> 02:46.867
That's a cut!

02:46.967 --> 02:48.133
Cut!

02:48.233 --> 02:49.200
- [indistinct chatter]

02:49.300 --> 02:51.467
- Vernon Brown never cries.

02:51.567 --> 02:56.933
- *

02:57.067 --> 02:58.467
* Still the King

02:58.567 --> 03:00.533
- Oh my God, this is so cool.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.667
I can't believe they're like
actually making a movie

03:02.767 --> 03:03.633
about you.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.267
- Oh yeah,
all the greats have 'em.

03:05.367 --> 03:07.533
Hank Williams,
Johnny Cash, Spider-Man.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.067
- Wow, they got
everything here.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.367
Gum, granola, shrimp cocktail.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.667
- Sounds like a gross trail mix.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.067
- Doily?
How am I doing, man?

03:15.133 --> 03:16.367
Am I nailing your mannerisms?

03:16.467 --> 03:18.667
- It's like
I'm looking in a mirror.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.300
Yeah, man.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.067
- Hello, Vernon.

03:22.133 --> 03:25.067
Sorry, guys, can I--can I
steal you for a quick sec?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.833
- Uh, sure, Ron, what up?

03:26.933 --> 03:29.533
- I just wanna say how
great it is to have you on set,

03:29.633 --> 03:33.100
but I also wanna remind you that
you're here as a consultant.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.500
Which is also great.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.067
But, um, I'm kind
of the director.

03:36.100 --> 03:39.733
So, uh, it's kind of
my job to yell cut. I'm sorry.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.933
- Mum's the word, pal.
- Great, okay, great. Awesome.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.567
Um, look--look, I'm sorry things
got a little heated just now.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.600
It's just that we're running on
such a tight schedule,

03:47.700 --> 03:50.433
and I can't afford anything
slowing down production.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.067
I just hope
you're not mad at me.

03:52.167 --> 03:55.767
- Uh, no, but while I got you
here, can I just mention to you,

03:55.867 --> 03:58.133
man, I think Trayne
got a bit emotional there

03:58.233 --> 03:59.433
toward the end of that scene.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.067
- Yeah, terrible stuff, right?

04:01.133 --> 04:03.167
Reminds me when I was directing
"Incomparable Shannon Doherty"--

04:03.267 --> 04:04.600
- Great work, man, great work.

04:04.700 --> 04:05.600
But you're not hearing me.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.133
Vernon Brown never cries.

04:08.233 --> 04:10.600
- Not like ever?
- Never.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.867
- *

04:13.967 --> 04:15.633
- [doorbell rings]

04:17.700 --> 04:19.667
- Hey, guys.
- Deb, you are a lifesaver.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.400
Thank you so much
for watching these two.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.833
- Of course.

04:22.933 --> 04:24.600
It'll be good practice for
when the little guy arrives.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.633
- Oh my God, it's a boy?

04:26.733 --> 04:28.233
- I found out this morning.

04:28.333 --> 04:29.733
- Have you told
Ronnie and Vernon yet?

04:29.833 --> 04:31.167
- No, I'm gonna
tell 'em tonight.

04:31.267 --> 04:33.133
- That is so exciting.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.167
Well, I told Bobby
and John Cougar

04:35.267 --> 04:37.067
to be on their best behavior.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.167
Isn't that right, you two?

04:38.267 --> 04:39.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.500
- Come on, we'll have fun.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.800
- Okay.
Alright now...

04:42.900 --> 04:44.733
make sure that John Cougar
doesn't have any sugar,

04:44.833 --> 04:47.233
or he will be bouncing
off the walls.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.633
And Bobby's
going through a phase

04:48.733 --> 04:50.067
where he asks
a lot of questions.

04:50.133 --> 04:53.433
- I got it, I got it. Go on.
We're gonna be fine.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.133
Wouldn't we, guys?

04:55.233 --> 04:57.133
- *

04:57.233 --> 04:58.433
Guys?

04:58.533 --> 04:59.433
- [glass shattering]

04:59.533 --> 05:02.133
- [bleep].

05:02.233 --> 05:03.367
- Here's a good choice.

05:03.467 --> 05:04.800
Uh, it says I'm rugged

05:04.900 --> 05:07.167
but not in a crystal meth addict
kind of way.

05:07.267 --> 05:08.867
- Nope, not the right one.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.500
- Trayne, I hate
to be task master,

05:10.600 --> 05:12.867
but we've been deciding on a hat
for over an hour.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.367
Can you just pick one, so we
can get you to act a little?

05:15.467 --> 05:16.767
- Pick one?

05:16.867 --> 05:18.400
I didn't shadow Vernon Brown
for almost eight hours

05:18.500 --> 05:19.867
so I could act like him.

05:19.967 --> 05:23.067
I must be him, and let the hat
do the acting for me.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.767
Does that make sense to you?

05:24.867 --> 05:26.567
- Yeah, it makes perfect sense

05:26.667 --> 05:28.333
now that you explained it
to me like that.

05:28.433 --> 05:29.967
Uh, how 'bout we shoot
some other scenes?

05:30.067 --> 05:32.767
- I can't concentrate
without the right hat!

05:32.867 --> 05:34.467
I have the right hat at home.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.633
It's the Argonaut.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.200
It's black buffalo felt.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.500
- Oh, like this one.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.200
- Nothing like that one.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.067
- Get the Argonaut!

05:42.167 --> 05:44.467
- *

05:46.600 --> 05:48.867
- Uh, Vernon Brown
is in the bathroom, and I think

05:48.967 --> 05:50.600
we're gonna need a little
bit of backup.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.767
It seems--
- Hey!

05:51.867 --> 05:53.067
- WOMAN: Copy that, ten-three.

05:53.133 --> 05:56.067
- Hey, I need you
or another P.A. to go over

05:56.167 --> 05:58.933
to Trayne's house and grab
a very special hat for him.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.067
It's a rush.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.700
- You want me to go
to Trayne's house?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.733
- Yeah, is there a problem?

06:03.833 --> 06:06.667
- Uh, no, no, no problem.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.567
As an official P.A.
on this movie set,

06:09.667 --> 06:14.067
um, it is my job to go do that.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.067
- Here's his address.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.600
Drive fast.
- Okay.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.667
- [phone ringing]

06:24.767 --> 06:26.300
- Lloy, what are you doing
like right now?

06:26.400 --> 06:27.633
- [bell rings]

06:27.733 --> 06:30.133
- And action.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.400
Please, of course.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.733
- *

06:40.133 --> 06:42.800
- [crying]

06:46.433 --> 06:47.567
- It's beautiful.

06:47.667 --> 06:51.733
- [crying continues]

06:51.833 --> 06:53.500
- It's so damn beautiful.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.133
I'm sorry.
- [bell rings]

06:55.233 --> 07:00.633
- *

07:00.733 --> 07:06.200
- [indistinct police scanner]

07:06.300 --> 07:08.833
- Why God?

07:08.933 --> 07:10.500
Why God?

07:10.600 --> 07:14.067
[unintelligible]

07:14.167 --> 07:16.100
Ah!

07:16.200 --> 07:20.167
[crying]

07:20.267 --> 07:23.067
- I'm telling you, I can hear
him balling through the door.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.400
- Look on the bright side.
He can't cry in every scene.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.633
He's gonna have to take a break
and hydrate at some point.

07:27.733 --> 07:29.233
- [crying continues]

07:29.333 --> 07:30.533
- [bell rings]

07:30.633 --> 07:35.633
- *

07:35.733 --> 07:40.100
- [audience clapping]

07:40.200 --> 07:41.233
- I'm Vernon Brown.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.133
And I always get center stage.

07:43.233 --> 07:44.900
- Come on, Vernon,
can't we share a spotlight?

07:45.067 --> 07:47.433
- Hell no, Trayne Crowstown,
you beautiful man.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.933
There's only room
in the spotlight for one!

07:50.067 --> 07:52.933
- *

07:53.067 --> 07:55.100
- Uh!

07:55.200 --> 07:56.667
- [grunts]

07:56.767 --> 07:59.467
Trayne, please!
Have mercy, Trayne!

07:59.567 --> 08:02.067
Oh!

08:02.100 --> 08:03.367
- Cut!

08:03.467 --> 08:04.467
No!

08:04.567 --> 08:06.100
This ain't gonna work!

08:06.200 --> 08:07.300
Cut!

08:07.400 --> 08:08.267
- [music cuts out]

08:08.367 --> 08:09.233
- What the--

08:14.567 --> 08:17.467
- Guys, we gotta derail
this Trayne before he makes me

08:17.567 --> 08:19.300
look like the world's
biggest crybaby.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.633
- How are we gonna do that?
- I don't know, man.

08:21.733 --> 08:22.800
You're the brain
of this operation.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.400
I'm just the good
looks...and everything else.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.900
- We've got two options.

08:27.067 --> 08:30.833
Option one, do the adult thing,
go talk to Trayne man to man.

08:30.933 --> 08:32.067
- Bring on option two.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.833
- Remember when we were
in the recording studio

08:33.933 --> 08:35.067
Trayne mentioned
he's allergic to shellfish?

08:35.100 --> 08:36.067
- I got it.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.900
Trayne's allergic
to shellfish, right?

08:38.067 --> 08:39.333
They're serving shrimp onset.

08:39.433 --> 08:41.500
We feed one to Trayne,
he's gonna have a reaction.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.433
He's not gonna be able
to do his scenes.

08:43.533 --> 08:45.067
Ha-ha, Doily, you did it again.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.167
- No, you didn't, that's exactly
what I was gonna suggest

08:47.267 --> 08:48.100
before I was interrupted.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.533
- How are
we gonna slip back onset

08:49.633 --> 08:51.100
without them noticing us?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.733
Doily, you think you could
occupy that guard's time

08:56.833 --> 08:59.167
while Walt and I slip back in?

08:59.267 --> 09:01.567
- Vern...I've never
been more sure

09:01.667 --> 09:03.233
of anything in my entire life.

09:04.900 --> 09:08.400
Excuse me, sir.
- [slaps]

09:08.500 --> 09:10.600
- That's one way of doing it.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.600
- Wow.

09:11.700 --> 09:12.900
- Let's get it on!

09:13.067 --> 09:14.767
- *

09:18.333 --> 09:20.167
* Oh yeah

09:20.267 --> 09:21.433
* Come on *

09:27.167 --> 09:30.067
- *

09:30.167 --> 09:31.300
- Wow.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.800
That's a scary looking spider,
John Cougar.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.633
- It's a picture of Mommy.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.967
- Good job.
She looks so pretty.

09:39.067 --> 09:40.800
- My mom says
you're having a baby.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.067
Where do babies come from?

09:43.133 --> 09:46.767
- You know, that's
an interesting question, Bobby.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.667
Um, you see,
when a mommy and a daddy

09:49.767 --> 09:53.367
really love each other,
they--they wish upon a star--

09:53.467 --> 09:55.933
- Tommy Long from school says
it's from when you get married,

09:56.067 --> 09:58.300
then they start playing
[bleep] music, then everyone

09:58.400 --> 10:01.867
starts [bleep], and they make
[bleep] together,

10:01.967 --> 10:03.400
and they all live
happily ever after.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.900
Then their love explodes
all over the [bleep].

10:09.933 --> 10:11.300
- John Cougar!

10:11.400 --> 10:13.900
John, wait!
John, I'm not mad, wait!

10:14.000 --> 10:17.033
John! Come back!

10:17.133 --> 10:18.900
Stay here, okay, please.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.033
- I didn't do it.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.467
- Holy--
- --[bleep].

10:38.967 --> 10:41.333
- [knocking at door]

10:41.433 --> 10:42.467
- Hello?

10:42.567 --> 10:45.567
Is anyone home?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.333
Holy--

10:50.267 --> 10:54.500
- Greetings and salutations!

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
Hey, guys!

10:55.700 --> 10:56.600
- Hey, Dave.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.100
Um, it's Charlotte.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.167
I'm Vernon Brown's daughter.

11:00.267 --> 11:01.300
- Lloy.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.600
- I'm Crazy Dave.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.400
I'm Trayne's personal assistant.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.533
Stay there.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.800
I'll be right down.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.900
- *

11:10.067 --> 11:12.367
- [dog barking]

11:15.367 --> 11:20.267
- CRAZY DAVE:
[breathing heavy]

11:20.367 --> 11:22.067
Hey.

11:22.133 --> 11:25.100
It was great that you guys
could come over and hang.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.633
- Uh, we just really need
to pick up Trayne's hat.

11:28.733 --> 11:30.733
- Oh.

11:30.833 --> 11:34.233
Well, that's okay,
come on, come on.

11:34.333 --> 11:35.400
Chop, chop.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.967
- Whoa.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.700
What a place you have here.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.067
- Oh no, I don't live here.

11:44.133 --> 11:46.933
I live in the corrugated shed
in the back.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.100
You must be looking
for the Argonaut.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.533
That's Trayne's most prized hat.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.200
- What's in here?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.333
- Oh, that's a paintball room.

11:58.433 --> 12:02.133
After a long day, the only thing
that really seems to relax him

12:02.233 --> 12:06.900
is hunting nature's
most dangerous animal--man.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.267
I love paintball.

12:08.367 --> 12:11.367
But sometimes the balls,
they--they really make a mark.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.300
- Wait, wait, wait, you're
telling me that when Trayne

12:13.400 --> 12:15.367
gets stressed out, he runs
after you with a paintball gun?

12:15.467 --> 12:17.633
- Oh, don't be silly.
He doesn't run.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.367
He's got go-karts.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.333
- I mean how long
could one round take?

12:25.433 --> 12:28.333
- *

12:41.767 --> 12:43.300
- Alright, it's go time.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.367
Listen, if I get caught,
I need you to make sure--

12:46.467 --> 12:47.467
- Save myself?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.800
- No, come find me.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.067
I'm gonna need your help
for something.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.367
- Sure. Either or.

12:51.467 --> 12:54.933
- Keep a lookout.
- Alright.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.133
- [dog barking]

13:00.567 --> 13:02.533
- John Cougar, have you seen
your brother?

13:10.967 --> 13:12.100
Hey, what you doing, little man?

13:12.200 --> 13:13.167
- What's the plant called?

13:13.267 --> 13:14.833
Is it poisonous
or can you eat it?

13:14.933 --> 13:17.867
How big will it get?

13:17.967 --> 13:20.733
- [door slams and locks]

13:20.833 --> 13:21.967
- [rattling and knocking
at door]

13:22.067 --> 13:23.833
- Oh, [bleep].

13:23.933 --> 13:27.300
John Cougar!
This isn't funny!

13:27.400 --> 13:29.667
John Cougar, come open the door!

13:29.767 --> 13:31.200
John Cougar!

13:31.300 --> 13:33.067
Don't need to panic,
Deb, you got this.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.467
- [electric knife buzzing]
- [maniacal laughing]

13:43.667 --> 13:45.367
- Okay, time to panic
a little, Deb.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.733
Hey, little man, do you
wanna play a fun game?

13:51.833 --> 13:53.733
- Yep. What's it called?
- It's called Secret Mission.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.700
And you're secret mission
is to climb through that window

13:56.800 --> 13:58.733
then go around and open
that front door for me.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.100
Can you do that?
- Yep.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.500
Is there a time limit?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.567
Get your little ass in there.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.800
Good boy.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.567
Bobby! Bobby, wrong way!

14:07.667 --> 14:08.600
Wrong way!

14:08.700 --> 14:10.733
Hey, can you just hand me
those keys?

14:10.833 --> 14:12.400
Yeah, just here.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.800
- [toilet flushes]

14:19.833 --> 14:24.533
- [phone ringing]

14:24.633 --> 14:26.933
- Hey, Deb, can't really talk
right now.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.333
Walt and I are trying to sneak
a shrimp into Trayne's mouth.

14:30.433 --> 14:31.633
- DEB: I don't even wanna know.

14:31.733 --> 14:33.667
- Listen, is there
any way you can run home

14:33.767 --> 14:34.700
and bring me your keys?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.567
I don't wanna bother
Ronnie at work.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.833
- Psst, hey!

14:37.933 --> 14:40.433
- DEBBI: John Cougar,
don't paint the television!

14:40.533 --> 14:42.767
- Uh, listen, I kinda
got my hands full right now.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.600
I gotta go. We'll talk later.

14:44.700 --> 14:45.833
- [phone beeps]

14:47.900 --> 14:49.067
- RONNIE: Go for Ronnie.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.933
- I could really use your help.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.533
That better be chocolate!

14:56.800 --> 14:58.767
- [snoring]

14:58.867 --> 15:03.333
- Alright, Little Walter,
it's time to shine.

15:03.433 --> 15:07.333
- TRAYNE: [snoring]

15:13.767 --> 15:14.833
- [munching]

15:14.933 --> 15:15.967
- Shoo, go away.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.667
Damn you, Panda.

15:17.767 --> 15:21.367
- [growling]

15:21.467 --> 15:23.100
- You nauseatingly adorable
little bastard.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.367
- [dog growling]

15:36.133 --> 15:38.900
[dog whines]

15:39.067 --> 15:40.633
- Damn it.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.900
- *

15:43.067 --> 15:44.400
- [licking]

15:44.500 --> 15:46.800
- Uh, who is that? Huh?

15:46.900 --> 15:48.867
Who is that?
You waking up, Daddy?

15:48.967 --> 15:50.233
Are you waking up, Daddy?

15:50.333 --> 15:52.333
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.833
- [engine shuts off]

15:56.933 --> 15:58.533
- Ronnie, thank you
so much for coming.

15:58.633 --> 16:00.800
- No problem, babe.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.067
When my lady calls,
it's my duty to show up.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.667
Even if I gotta cut lunch
an hour too short.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.433
- Do you remember
the movie "The Omen"?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.267
Okay, there's
two of them in here.

16:09.367 --> 16:10.433
- RONNIE: Two--two what?

16:10.533 --> 16:12.467
- Two Damiens.
- Oh God.

16:12.567 --> 16:14.300
- Ronnie, they have
knives and lighters.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.500
I mean, they're evil.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.800
- Alright, it's all good now.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.467
Back up.
- Wait, what are you doing?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.267
- Relax. I've seen this
on "Cops Reloaded"

16:20.367 --> 16:22.500
like a million times.
- Ronnie, wait!

16:22.600 --> 16:25.167
- Ah!
- [glass shattering]

16:25.267 --> 16:27.233
- Ronnie, you have a key.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.333
- Yeah.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.233
Yeah, I realize that...now.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.467
- [electric knife buzzing]

16:36.667 --> 16:40.067
- Whoa, alright, boys,
um, Uncle Ronnie's here.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.067
- Hey, how'd you kick
a hole through the door?

16:42.133 --> 16:44.733
- It's the deadly
art of karate. I'm a master.

16:44.833 --> 16:45.900
Tell you what.

16:46.067 --> 16:48.333
I'll teach you
the forbidden secrets, but...

16:48.433 --> 16:49.867
you gotta do me a solid.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.100
- *

16:52.200 --> 16:56.200
- [razor buzzing]

16:56.300 --> 16:57.867
- Whoa, what's that haircut
called?

16:57.967 --> 16:59.233
- That's the
[unintelligible] man.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.633
All the cool dudes have one.

17:00.733 --> 17:01.833
You wanna jump onboard?

17:01.933 --> 17:02.800
- Uh, uh, uh.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.867
One unauthorized haircut
is enough.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.300
- Sorry, pal,
you heard the lady.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.600
- Will you show us karate now?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.733
- Well, now that you are
properly quaffed,

17:09.833 --> 17:13.233
maybe you are ready
to be shown...the way.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.967
- [gong sounds]
- Alright.

17:16.067 --> 17:19.333
I want you to hit me
as hard as--ugh!

17:19.433 --> 17:21.300
- Ronnie, are you okay?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.067
- RONNIE: [moaning]
Never better.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.067
- Oh, God, it's so much fun.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.867
You realize we are never
gonna top this moment?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.867
- Ever! Indoor go-kart paintball
is the dragon

17:28.967 --> 17:31.933
we're gonna be chasing
the rest of lives.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.600
- Yeah.
Now that was a lot of fun.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.633
Um, can we go get
Trayne's hat now?

17:40.833 --> 17:43.300
- That's a lot of hats.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.433
- Which one is the Argonaut?

17:45.533 --> 17:48.800
- Oh, behold.

17:48.900 --> 17:52.700
- *

17:58.167 --> 18:00.333
- The Argonaut!

18:00.433 --> 18:02.867
Hundred percent pure buffalo--

18:02.967 --> 18:04.067
- Sweet!

18:04.100 --> 18:05.067
Thanks, Dave.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.667
- [dolphins vocalizing]

18:07.767 --> 18:08.633
- What is that noise?

18:08.733 --> 18:09.767
- DAVE: Those are the dolphins.

18:09.867 --> 18:11.733
They're probably getting hungry.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.467
Oh, they eat like pigs.

18:13.567 --> 18:14.633
- [dolphins vocalizing]

18:14.733 --> 18:16.267
- You wanna see?

18:16.367 --> 18:19.433
- [dolphins vocalizing]

18:19.533 --> 18:21.500
- Of course he has dolphins.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.567
- Swims naked
with 'em every morning.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.600
You guys have time for a dip?

18:26.700 --> 18:29.733
- I mean, how long
could it take?

18:29.833 --> 18:31.933
- What the hell
took you so long?

18:32.067 --> 18:33.500
- Trayne's Panda
got ahold of that shrimp

18:33.600 --> 18:34.567
before I could make contact.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.800
- Then we're screwed.

18:36.900 --> 18:37.967
- Hey.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.533
- Hey, sorry to bug you,
but is the hat here yet?

18:40.633 --> 18:42.333
It's just that--oh good God!

18:42.433 --> 18:43.733
What's going on with your face?

18:43.833 --> 18:45.833
- Huh?
- It's nothing.

18:45.933 --> 18:47.833
I mean, if anyone could pull
this look off, it's you.

18:47.933 --> 18:49.100
- What are you talking about?

18:51.067 --> 18:52.433
Ahhhh!

18:52.533 --> 18:54.267
- [laughs]

18:54.367 --> 18:55.567
- You look away!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.300
I'm hideous!

18:57.400 --> 18:58.467
- Trayne!

18:58.567 --> 19:00.233
Trayne, wait, we'll
fix it in post.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.633
I mean, we'll get a medic.
I'll get a medic! Medic!

19:02.733 --> 19:05.267
Don't panic. Nobody panic!

19:05.367 --> 19:08.067
- Okay, I'm pretty sure
I just committed a felony.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.267
So I'm gonna go.

19:10.367 --> 19:12.300
You coming?
- No way, man.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.833
I wanna see how this plays out.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.133
- Just computer generate me.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.133
CGI!

19:19.233 --> 19:20.500
- [dog barking]

19:20.600 --> 19:22.667
- *

19:22.767 --> 19:24.200
- What'd I miss?

19:24.300 --> 19:27.300
- Poor old Trayne had an
allergic reaction to something.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.533
They're gonna have to replace
him to stay on schedule.

19:30.633 --> 19:31.867
Damn shame.

19:31.967 --> 19:33.933
- I have never
seen anyone say damn shame

19:34.067 --> 19:35.867
with that big of a smile.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.567
- Hey, where'd you
get that cool hat?

19:37.667 --> 19:39.667
- Uh, it's actually Trayne's?

19:39.767 --> 19:41.067
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:41.133 --> 19:44.233
- It looks more like
a Vernon Brown style hat to me.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.267
- [laughs] You know, I was
thinking the same exact thing.

19:47.367 --> 19:49.433
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.167
- Be honest.

19:51.267 --> 19:53.500
How were they?

19:53.600 --> 19:55.067
- Little angels.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.333
- Oooh.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.467
How did you manage to get
John Cougar to cut his hair?

19:58.567 --> 20:01.967
I have taken him to the barber
twice this month, and he freaks.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.100
- You know, it was all Ronnie.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.900
You know, it turns out
he has a way with kids.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
- Got the boys all loaded up.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.433
They look like cute
little Hannibal Lector's

20:10.533 --> 20:11.800
strapped into their car seats.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.467
- Well, thank you so much,
Ronnie.

20:13.567 --> 20:14.900
I owe you two big time.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.433
You have a babysitter for life.

20:17.533 --> 20:18.567
- [horn honking]

20:18.667 --> 20:19.900
- Hey, you keep it down!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.233
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood!

20:22.333 --> 20:24.667
- [sighs]

20:24.767 --> 20:27.167
- Take a load off.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.433
- You know, I wasn't sure
I could do this whole

20:29.533 --> 20:30.600
new mom thing again.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.167
- What? You did a great job
with Charlotte.

20:33.267 --> 20:36.600
- Plus, being mom
is like riding a bike.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.367
- What? You never forget?

20:38.467 --> 20:42.500
- No. It's super hard,
you never totally master it.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.000
But still, you try your best.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.067
- That's really sweet, Ronnie.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.567
Also, do you not know
how to ride a bike?

20:49.667 --> 20:50.833
- [door opens]

20:50.933 --> 20:52.300
- Oh, hey you two.
- Hi.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.367
- How was your shoot?

20:53.467 --> 20:54.667
- Great.

20:54.767 --> 20:56.100
- They had to shut down
production though.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.900
Trayne had a mysterious reaction
to some shrimp.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.667
- Wonder how that happened.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.733
- Sometimes things
just happen for the best.

21:03.833 --> 21:07.700
- Well, now that
I have all you guys here,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.833
I have some news.

21:09.933 --> 21:12.800
I went to the doctor
this morning and...

21:12.900 --> 21:14.533
I'm having a boy.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.533
- RONNIE AND CHARLTTE:
[cheering]

21:16.633 --> 21:19.267
- That's so exciting.
Oh my God.

21:19.367 --> 21:20.400
- I'm gonna have a son.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.567
- *

21:23.667 --> 21:25.167
- Dad, are you tearing up?

21:25.267 --> 21:27.067
- Oh no, honey.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.733
Vernon Brown never cries.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.067
- I can't believe it!

21:31.133 --> 21:33.100
There's gonna be a boy
to carry on the family name.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.433
- [glass shatters]
- ALL: Damn it, Ronnie!

21:38.200 --> 21:39.400
- Ready to shoot
your scene, Buddy?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.267
- Not without the Argonaut.
Right, baby girl?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.433
- Maybe we could just shoot
a couple scenes for fun,

21:43.533 --> 21:44.600
you know, until the hat arrives.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.133
- [dog whining]

21:46.233 --> 21:49.967
- Ron, do you think I went
to the Lee Strasburg

21:50.067 --> 21:54.167
Online School of Acting
Institute to do this for fun?

21:54.267 --> 21:57.300
Acting's been a passion of mine
for several weeks now.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.067
I take it seriously.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.300
I just--I want you
to do the same.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.233
- * Say oh

22:07.400 --> 22:09.300
- *
