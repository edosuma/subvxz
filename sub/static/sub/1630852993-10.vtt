I do. [imitates male voice]

any other rings in your store

that Tallulah and Nini really
need my help with today,

and lost them!

-That's it.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.891

a big help today...

I said I'd be the biggest help.

-And the biggest help
doesn't quit.

but, you're welcome.

more than two pieces of jewelry

to get home

07:32.827 --> 07:35.121
and help the others
before the wedding starts

07:35.204 --> 07:36.080
I'm on it.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.959
Huh? What's going on?

07:40.042 --> 07:42.170
The cupcakes got burnt.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.671
Oh no! How?

07:43.754 --> 07:45.006
[crackles]

07:45.089 --> 07:47.300
Well, when you left
to find the rings,

07:47.383 --> 07:49.594
you kind of took
my spoon.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.722
How am I just
noticing this?

07:53.681 --> 07:54.932
I don't know.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.560
Anywho, I had to mix
the batter with my hands.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.937
Then I put the cupcakes
in the oven and...

08:00.021 --> 08:01.439
Gramsy came to help me,

08:01.522 --> 08:03.357
but she accidentally got batter
all over my fabric

08:03.441 --> 08:04.942
and I couldn't finish
Nini's suit.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.944
[Freckle] And then the cupcake
started burning.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.404
So I went into the kitchen,

08:08.487 --> 08:10.907
but I tripped and my piccolo
fell into my tuba

08:10.990 --> 08:12.116
[distorted tune]

08:12.200 --> 08:14.452
and [grunts] now I can't
play the song.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.914
No song? No suit?
No cupcakes?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.457
And no rings...

08:19.540 --> 08:21.083
I've ruined
Tallulah and Nini's--

08:21.167 --> 08:23.252

08:24.128 --> 08:25.004

08:43.356 --> 08:45.107
Why do y'all look so glum?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.693
I burned all
but these two cupcakes.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.862
And I didn't finish
your suit, Nini.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.447
I finished
writing my song

08:51.530 --> 08:54.283
but I got nothing
to play it on.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.495
And I...
I lost your wedding rings.

08:57.578 --> 08:58.454
[gulps]

08:58.538 --> 08:59.622
This is all my fault.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.207
I pushed everyone
to do too much.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.042
I wanted to be
the biggest help,

09:03.125 --> 09:05.544
but instead I was
the biggest disappointment.

09:07.546 --> 09:08.923
Tallulah and Nini,

09:09.006 --> 09:11.634
can you ever forgive me
for ruining your wedding?

09:12.843 --> 09:16.472
[both laughing]

09:16.555 --> 09:18.224
It's okay, Lollipop.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.476
I know you worked
so hard today,

09:20.559 --> 09:23.145
and did your best to complete
everything in time.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.023
We really appreciate all you
helping us...

09:26.107 --> 09:28.317
but, well,
we're laughing because--

09:28.401 --> 09:31.195
We didn't finish any of our
wedding tasks either.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.697
And that's okay.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.158
We realized we don't need
all that fancy stuff, anyway.

09:36.242 --> 09:39.745
All that matters is that we get
to celebrate our love

09:39.829 --> 09:42.832
in the company
of good friends and family.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.002
So, should we get this
wedding started or what?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.420
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

09:47.503 --> 09:49.380
You can play your wedding song
on this, Freckle.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.591
I always keep a spare
instrument in my bag.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.967
That'll do.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.011
[playing violin]

09:55.094 --> 09:56.512
Here you go, kiddo.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.514
You can be the cupcake bearer.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.641
[playing violin]

10:12.403 --> 10:15.781
We are gathered here today
to celebrate a love sweeter

10:15.865 --> 10:18.659
than all the beignet sugar
in the world.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.245
Ellen, if you would.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.373
Tallulah and Nini:

10:24.457 --> 10:26.584
once you exchange
these cupcakes,

10:26.667 --> 10:28.961
you will officially
become wives.

10:29.628 --> 10:30.755
[clinks]

10:30.838 --> 10:33.299
There's something
in our cupcakes.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.717
[both] Our rings!

10:38.554 --> 10:40.056
They weren't lost,
after all.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.308
I just dropped them
in the cupcake batter.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.809
[chuckles nervously]

10:43.893 --> 10:46.854
Thank you all for making our
wedding so special.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.023
You were the biggest help.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.149
[all cheering]

10:50.232 --> 10:53.194
-Tallulah and Nini!
-Teeny!

10:54.695 --> 10:56.781
[violin music playing]

11:03.621 --> 11:04.455
[kisses]

11:11.879 --> 11:13.339
