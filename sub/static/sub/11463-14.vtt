WEBVTT

00:25.817 --> 00:27.978
Come on, come on!

00:28.111 --> 00:29.521
Damn it.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.706
Now at least I understand.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.168
- What?
- A new love Will make a man brave.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.126
You understand?

05:47.263 --> 05:49.003
Let's hope so.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.698
What are you doing?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.823
Just thinking.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.918
Been here all night?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.537
Pretty much.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.713
That's a lot of thinking.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.096
I'm just trying
to find the words

06:29.222 --> 06:30.883
to say what I want,

06:31.015 --> 06:33.506
in a way
that you'll hear.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.599
There's nothing
to say, Mad.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.056
Bullshit.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.605
Travis...

06:42.944 --> 06:45.435
you kept your promise
to Liza.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.607
You did. She asked you
to protect him,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.696
and in this world...
this new world,

06:49.826 --> 06:52.158
where the rules
are different

06:52.286 --> 06:55.653
and always changing,
that's exactly what you did.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.080
He's safer where people
understand him.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.955
I want to believe you.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.457
I know.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.801
That's not going
to happen right away.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.091
I'm gonna make you
a promise.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.089
I'm gonna hold on
to it for you.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.059
Remind you
every chance I get

07:18.187 --> 07:19.973
until you do believe it.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.901
You belong here.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.412
So, when you're ready,
come downstairs.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.228
Hey, it's the guy with the ratty hair!

08:10.406 --> 08:11.361
Get down!

08:12.450 --> 08:13.690
We have the Oxy.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.575
Oxy.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.489
We want to talk to Marco.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.962
Yeah?

08:39.560 --> 08:41.141
Hey.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.976
Hey.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.234
You hungry?

08:49.111 --> 08:50.976
Yeah.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.280
They cook everything
in here in lard.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.202
It's pretty delicious.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.425
Should I?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.886
Yeah, sure.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.364
Travis, I'm sorry.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.492
| feel like I pushed Chris
further away by being so...

09:43.624 --> 09:46.001
No.
You were scared.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.411
You had
every right to be.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.963
Look...

09:58.848 --> 10:00.463
Chris...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.556
he's sick.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.178
I couldn't see it.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.848
He's my son.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.526
Look, I'm sorry
that I didn't believe you.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.869
Look, I'm sorry
that I didn't believe you.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.785
I'm sorry that l...

10:26.917 --> 10:28.908
I didn't protect
you better.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.205
I should have.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.886
It's okay.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.009
It's okay.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.701
This is where they keep the Sombras.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.914
How will we get in?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.175
With a lot of firepower.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.338
Well, my cousins are ready.

11:26.268 --> 11:29.180
It will be
like stealing candy from a child.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.232
Look at you! Surprise! Surprise!

11:34.402 --> 11:36.984
/ know you found us.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.728
The gringo learns fast.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.482
l'm oﬁ‘ering you this.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.821
We deliver every week
on time.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.245
Your word,
you leave us alone.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.957
/ like him.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.335
I like you.

12:04.348 --> 12:07.465
You've got nothing to hide,
not like any Gringo I ever met.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.429
But the game's over.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.314
We don't need
your shit anymore.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.308
You see that guy?

12:19.405 --> 12:22.397
He controls all the drugs
left in Tijuana.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.111
His people and my people,
we didn't used to get along.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.868
Now I got something
he wants.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.792
And we are like
best friends now.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.461
You know what I got?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.261
A fortress.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.550
I know how
you get in, out,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.642
using the sombras
as your army.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.979
- Very chill nights up on that hill.
- Very good.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.607
So, if you don't
want to die,

13:02.740 --> 13:05.527
leave today.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.861
All those people...
Where do you want us to go?

13:09.872 --> 13:11.237
All those people...
Where do you want us to go?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.624
I don't give a shit
what happens to your people.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.076
Come here, gringo.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.513
So, you run back
and say this...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.891
you leave now...

13:40.027 --> 13:41.358
or die.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.577
Hey, how'd it go
last night?

13:56.710 --> 13:58.371
Better than expected.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.914
A night of sleep
without fear

14:00.047 --> 14:01.548
is good for the soul.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.131
Hey.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.464
Andres hasn't slept.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.134
Most people haven't seen
a doctor since it began.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.724
- They seem appreciative.
- That's good.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.593
Oh. What's that smell?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.106
- Dude, don't say it.
- Wait, don't say what?

14:18.232 --> 14:20.348
- Don't say it.
- What, that it smells like "Mexcrement"?

14:22.611 --> 14:24.351
Your countrymen.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.898
Can we kick them out?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.612
Seriously,
they're actually awful.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.072
Where did
they come from?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.361
They showed up
late last night.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.904
They were in a wreck.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.870
Andres says that one's
got a dislocated shoulder.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.205
He didn't have the heart
to send them away.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.369
My man needs
some medical attention.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.209
- Hello? Please?
- All right, I'm gonna see what I can do.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.131
Keep your voices down.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.592
Oh, don't worry, ma'am.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.052
These people are docile.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.716
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.138
So, you guys
were in an accident?

14:57.271 --> 14:59.478
Yeah, sorry.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.938
My buddy's
in a lot of pain.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.602
I think
it's dislocated.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.225
What about you?
You got banged up, too?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.897
No, not even a scratch.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.816
I swear, Derek made
some kind of a deal with the devil.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.030
I mean, the truck
must've rolled, what, a dozen times?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.490
| get this.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.110
The driver...

15:14.246 --> 15:17.079
Our buddy
who was driving...

15:17.207 --> 15:18.492
he didn't make it.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.586
I'm sorry.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.327
What happened?

15:23.464 --> 15:24.920
He let an idiot drive
is what happened.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.040
Now our truck is totaled,

15:27.176 --> 15:28.712
and we're stuck here

15:28.844 --> 15:30.584
in a sea
of border bandits.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.336
It's not my fault,
Brandon.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.304
Dude, I'm just
stating the facts.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.515
No, you're the one who said
he wasn't pulling his own weight.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.009
I didn't know the guy
didn't have his license,

15:38.145 --> 15:40.181
you did.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.101
Seriously, who the hell
grows up in LA. without a license?

15:43.233 --> 15:45.269
I don't know, man.
He was only 16.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.484
Yeah, when l was 16
I'd been driving for over a year.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.855
Derek, you said
your name was?

15:50.991 --> 15:54.028
Yeah, that's right.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.948
Strand?

15:57.081 --> 15:58.196
What now?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.618
Two American guys
showed up last night.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.207
They were in an accident.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.668
The guy that was driving
their truck was killed.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.537
That's tragic.
And?

16:08.550 --> 16:11.963
They're the guys
that Travis left Chris with.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.085
You sure?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.087
Derek and Brandon.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.431
And just the way
Travis described them,

16:17.559 --> 16:19.095
what are the chances
of that?

16:19.228 --> 16:20.308
Travis can't know
they're here.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.520
If I get rid of them,

16:23.649 --> 16:25.810
then we don't get
the truth about Chris.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.059
Orl know, I suspect,

16:28.195 --> 16:29.981
and I don't tell Travis?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.445
Isn't it
his right to know?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.859
The old rules of conduct
no longer apply.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.908
Breathe.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.787
Okay, Travis abandoned
his only child.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.630
- No, he didn't.
- He left him with these men.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.045
- He didn't abandoned him.
- He left him with these men.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.012
Yes.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.257
And I told him it was
the right thing to do for Chris.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.974
I told him it was
the best thing to do.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.852
Let me ask you something,
what keeps you going?

17:04.982 --> 17:07.519
In this world, what gets you up
in the morning?

17:07.651 --> 17:09.437
My kids... Nick, Alicia.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.276
That's right.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.147
With her, you've got
this amazing young woman,

17:14.283 --> 17:17.616
this amazing young woman
who you wake up to every single day.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.703
And with Nick, it's the hope
that he's out there, alive.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.368
- He is.
- And the hope that you'll see him again.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.752
l have that hope
with Thomas.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.288
But now the...

17:30.632 --> 17:33.715
It's a dark place,
Madison.

17:33.844 --> 17:36.802
Do you think Travis
can survive losing that hope?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.016
He's already broken.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.934
That'll kill him.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.558
- It's not... we can't take 300 people...
- I'll look for them.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.855
- Es verdad, but we need to tell...
- Nick.

17:52.988 --> 17:56.151
Okay, give me
a second, all right?

17:56.283 --> 17:57.318
Where have you been?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.109
You went there,
didn't you?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.827
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not, I'm not, yes.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.571
I went to see Marco,
okay?

18:04.708 --> 18:05.823
We made the drop.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.699
I know Alejandro
told me not to,

18:07.836 --> 18:09.542
but I had to.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.081
They found us.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.830
Lucy, they're coming
for the colonia.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.831
How? When?

18:14.968 --> 18:16.629
Soon.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.299
We have to tell
Alejandro now.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.805
Luciana.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.183
Yes.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.722
Okay.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.597
Hey, hey.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.473
I am sorry
I snuck away, all right,

18:31.610 --> 18:33.692
anleInever
lie to you.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.697
- I told you not to go there, Nick.
- I had to, okay?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.569
l was worried if they were coming for us,
it was going to be soon.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.366
- It is.
- We are outnumbered, outgunned.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.490
They know how to get
in and out.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.582
All we have going on
for us is gone.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.372
How can you say that?

18:51.505 --> 18:53.336
We need a plan,
Alejandro.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.886
Okay, I'll get Reynaldo
and the other scouts.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.471
We'll gather supplies
while you tell the others.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.967
But, look,
we need to leave now.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.265
Today,okay?
We pack what we can,

19:09.398 --> 19:12.356
we get everyone together
and we start walking.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.867
Nick!

19:25.831 --> 19:26.786
What is happening? No! No!

19:26.832 --> 19:29.118
No. No, no.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.433
It's alright.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.186
I'm fine.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.144
We flee death,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.473
and we give ourselves to death.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.851
We flee death,

21:58.025 --> 21:59.856
and we give ourselves to death.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.567
We flee death,

22:02.738 --> 22:04.899
and we give ourselves to death.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.601
What is it?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.564
Just worried
about time.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.282
We don't have a lot.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.996
It is faith
what matters most.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.451
It is this
what will protect us.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.127
We flee death,

23:03.298 --> 23:05.084
and we give ourselves to death.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.333
We flee death,

23:08.512 --> 23:10.298
and we give ourselves to death.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.766
This will be
a crowd-pleaser.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.315
Andres is gonna fix
your shoulder.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.184
Well, it's about time.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.399
Hey, you sure
you know how?

23:32.536 --> 23:33.992
Yeah, I'm sure.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.577
But it's gonna hurt
like hell.

23:35.705 --> 23:38.037
Let's get you somewhere
with a little more privacy.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.497
You have a room.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.287
Oh, we're getting out
of this shit-hole?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.661
That's the best news
I've heard in days.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.623
Got it?
Let's go.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.295
Where are they going?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.586
Where do you take 'em?
Are they getting a room?

23:52.764 --> 23:55.801
No one's getting a room.
They're just getting medical attention.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.217
But they got here after us and my
husband still hasn't seen the doctor.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.602
His injury is urgent. Your husbands
foot will be looked at very soon.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.139
- You prefer Americans!
- Where do you take them?

24:05.986 --> 24:08.853
How can you do this?
Hey, leave them here!

24:53.074 --> 24:55.406
Open the gate.
These assholes are leaving.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.075
Chris!

25:02.083 --> 25:03.584
Chris!

25:03.710 --> 25:05.416
Travis?

25:05.545 --> 25:07.376
Travis!

25:13.762 --> 25:15.002
Dear God.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Paco.
What the hell you doing?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.851
No, no, hey.
You can't do this.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.193
- No!
- You have to go.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.562
You gotta go.
They're gonna kill you.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.949
- Then protect us.
- We'll die out there.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.656
No. No way
we're going out.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.277
- No goddamn way.
- Wait, stop! Stop!

25:40.413 --> 25:41.994
- Maddie! Wait!
- Get off me!

25:42.123 --> 25:44.079
Stop!

25:44.209 --> 25:45.915
Where's Chris?

25:46.044 --> 25:47.284
Where's my son?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.963
Come on, Brandon,
tell me where he is.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.128
Where is my son?

25:54.261 --> 25:56.001
Come on, tell me.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.923
I need to know.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.893
What is it?

26:09.025 --> 26:10.310
I'm leaving.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.527
We're leaving.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.318
Faith is not going
to protect us when the shooting starts.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.736
We're not leaving.
Alejandro needs us.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.245
That's not
a reason to stay.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.987
Our people need us.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.240
- Alejandro's gonna find an answer.
- No.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.207
He won't find any answers, okay?

26:28.336 --> 26:29.416
He can't.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.539
Clean it good?

26:34.676 --> 26:36.837
Antiseptic?

26:44.561 --> 26:45.801
What is it
you think you saw, Nick?

26:45.937 --> 26:47.723
I saw you afraid.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.893
Yesterday, you were afraid
of people leaving.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.893
Today, you're afraid
of that bite.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.985
l was shaken.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.274
- There's a difference.
- You're lying.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.022
You're petrified.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.697
What are you
talking about?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.408
Tell her.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.040
You want to do this?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.004
No, I don't.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.248
But they are coming
to kill us.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.669
Look, the only way

27:17.802 --> 27:19.463
I am going to get her
to leave

27:19.596 --> 27:22.804
is if you tell her
what you really are.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.672
- Callate. Enough.
- Tell her!

27:24.809 --> 27:25.844
Enough!

27:30.732 --> 27:32.268
What are you
talking about?

27:40.408 --> 27:42.239
lam not immune.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.418
You're warm.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.712
You have a fever.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.091
He's infected.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.760
But I saw it.
I saw him bit.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.725
- I saw it.
- You saw what you wanted to see.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.640
l was bitten by the boy.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.264
The addict
I tried to save.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.687
People told a story
they wanted to believe.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.529
I didn't disabuse
them of it.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.899
I told the story,
not people.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.117
Me, my brother.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.907
You let us
believe you.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.119
VVhy?

28:29.249 --> 28:30.910
When they started
to rally around me,

28:31.042 --> 28:33.328
I knew that we could
build this place to protect ourselves.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.328
You mean they could build it
to protect you.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.334
l have fear.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.177
I didn't want to die.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.797
And I knew
I would out there.

28:47.934 --> 28:51.222
But more people survived
because of this place.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.936
More people survived
than died because of my lie.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.273
No one survives
what's coming, okay?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.984
Look, I'm sure as shit
not committing suicide

29:00.113 --> 29:01.273
for a fraud.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.488
Lucy, please.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.651
Just come away
with me.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.115
- Lucy.
- Please.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.780
Lucy.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.282
/ brought you here
under false pretenses.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.042
But the love you feel is real.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.624
You're like a daughter to me.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.500
And you...

29:23.762 --> 29:26.549
l have lost so many.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.758
I know.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.974
And when someone is dead for me,
I let them go.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.768
-Luci, please...
-No.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.651
We have to go.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.453
I'm not leaving.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.446
We have to.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.126
We have
to go now, okay?

30:47.470 --> 30:49.802
No.

30:49.931 --> 30:53.264
This place,
this is what matters.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.975
This is my home,
like I've never known one.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.060
But you don't
have to die for it.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.350
I'm not planning
on dying.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.600
- The faith we have, it has protected us.
- It's a lie.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.569
It doesn't mean
it hasn't worked.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.405
We have fared better here
than out in the world.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.990
Better than we fared

31:11.119 --> 31:13.451
even before
this all started.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.204
For most of us

31:21.337 --> 31:24.500
this is the first time
we have a place,

31:24.632 --> 31:26.338
a family.

31:38.479 --> 31:39.980
I'm not leaving.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.850
Our Father,
Who art in heaven.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.142
Hallowed be Thy Name.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.966
Come on.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.552
Come on.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.891
Hello, Miss.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.016
Welcome to America.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.249
I'll tell you
everything, all right?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.911
I will, man,
but I can't think straight

33:24.043 --> 33:25.374
with my arm like this.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.334
Yeah, can you fix
my man's shoulder, Travis?

33:27.463 --> 33:29.374
Please?
Can you do that?

33:29.507 --> 33:31.008
Trav?

33:32.135 --> 33:33.966
It's okay, Maddie.

33:35.763 --> 33:37.628
l... Ijust need to know.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.993
- That's it?
- Yeah, you'll be sore a few days,

34:01.122 --> 34:02.862
but that's it.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.752
Now, tell me.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.372
What happened to my son?

34:12.508 --> 34:14.294
Look, we'll tell you
what happened.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.758
All right? But...

34:15.887 --> 34:18.253
Look, we're scared here,
Travis.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.799
Now, you gotta
promise something.

34:19.932 --> 34:22.264
- Please.
- We'll tell you.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.385
We'll tell you. Come on, we'll tell you!

34:25.396 --> 34:26.602
We'll tell you. Come on, we'll tell you!

34:26.731 --> 34:28.312
But we need to know
we're being put out.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.227
We can't go with no vehicle.
We need a car to get back.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.940
- Done.
- Madison.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.435
No, I said it's done.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.160
We didn't get far.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.903
After we left.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.530
Wasted.

34:45.666 --> 34:47.372
Banditos on the highway...

34:47.502 --> 34:50.244
it was all one step fonNard,
two steps back.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.335
We were on no sleep.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.581
Me and Derek
doing the driving.

34:54.717 --> 34:58.050
We could barely keep
our eyes open.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.544
Chris...

35:00.890 --> 35:02.926
he volunteered, man.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.596
Okay, look, we didn't ask.
He offered.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.310
Yeah, he wanted
to contribute.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.185
What happened next?

35:13.653 --> 35:16.269
It went sideways, man.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.781
He must've dozed off.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.320
I'm sorry.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.616
The next thing you know...

35:25.748 --> 35:27.284
we started rolling.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.749
The truck must've rolled
a half a dozen times.

35:36.175 --> 35:37.881
Chris went through
the windshield.

35:38.010 --> 35:41.298
He was dead
when we found him.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.130
Was he?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.553
- What?
- Was he dead when you found him?

35:46.686 --> 35:48.642
Yeah.
Yeah, man, he was.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.432
I'm sorry, Travis.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.021
His neck was sort of jacked,
you know?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.856
Like he broke it
going through the glass.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.397
Trav?

35:58.823 --> 36:00.563
Yeah.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.163
Where is he?

36:17.300 --> 36:19.461
Where's Chris?
Where did you leave my son?

36:21.470 --> 36:24.052
We took care
of him after, Travis.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.843
We pulled him out
and we...

36:25.975 --> 36:27.966
we buried him by the tree.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.308
He would've liked it.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.689
So, was he thrown

36:35.818 --> 36:37.319
or did you pull him out?

36:38.529 --> 36:39.939
What?

36:41.490 --> 36:44.357
- Which was it?
- No, he was thrown.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.870
He was thrown
and we pulled him

36:46.996 --> 36:48.702
the rest of the way
to the tree.

36:58.883 --> 36:59.963
- Travis.
- Let them go.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.708
Just let them go.
Let them go.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.593
Travis,
what the hell, man?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.390
Travis?

37:15.191 --> 37:16.931
Travis!

37:17.068 --> 37:18.899
- Travis! Travis!
- Hey!

37:19.028 --> 37:21.314
- No, Travis!
- Stop!

37:21.447 --> 37:23.563
What did you do?

37:23.699 --> 37:24.859
Tell me what happened.

37:24.992 --> 37:27.278
What did you do?

37:27.411 --> 37:28.446
Tell me.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.577
Tell me the truth.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.576
- Tell me what happened!
- Travis, stop! Travis!

37:36.712 --> 37:38.327
Tell me the truth.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.670
- Travis.
- Please!

37:39.799 --> 37:41.960
Get the keys.
Get the goddamn keys!

37:42.093 --> 37:43.333
Tell me!
Where's my son?

37:43.469 --> 37:44.800
All right, Travis,
we'll tell you, man.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.169
- Please let him go.
- Where's my son?

37:46.305 --> 37:47.636
We'll tell you, man.
Please!

37:47.765 --> 37:49.266
We'll tell you
if you promise to stop.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.723
Please.

37:50.851 --> 37:52.136
Travis.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.261
No. No.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.228
Please.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.390
All right, we did it.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.188
We killed him.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.609
All right, we put him down.
We had to.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.027
We had to, man.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.368
We had to.

39:05.801 --> 39:08.258
- Travis, no.
Please stop.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.049
Please.
Travis, you have to stop.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.592
Please.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.700
Hey, stop!
That's enough!

39:34.705 --> 39:36.445
Travis, no.

39:38.501 --> 39:39.991
- Rah!
- Travis!

39:41.545 --> 39:43.285
Travis, stop it!

39:43.422 --> 39:45.708
Trav!
That's enough, Travis.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.834
Travis!

39:54.266 --> 39:55.301
Travis.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.061
Travis, let him go.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.727
- No, please stop.
- Travis, no.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.848
- Please.
- Travis! Please, stop it!

40:44.859 --> 40:45.894
- Please.
- Travis! Please, stop it!
