Good evening.
My name is Cain.

Oh, but of course, you know
The House of Mystery.

01:02.329 --> 01:06.098
It's that old, dark ruin,
at the end of the street

01:06.133 --> 01:09.668
that you would swear wasn't
there the last

terrifying and bizarre,

01:24.751 --> 01:26.585

01:26.620 --> 01:29.955

are forever changed

-I got a chocolate bar.
-I got a bag of taffy.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.076
I got a popcorn ball.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.544
I got a rock...

01:52.579 --> 01:56.081
Candy stick. Mmm.
Bit of all right, actually.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.849
That's the best house so far.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.285
I know.
What were those weirdoes
down the street thinking?

02:00.320 --> 02:01.753
Giving us toothbrushes.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.522
Lex has got a sick
sense of humor.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.957
Though, it is gratifying to
see adults concerned with

02:05.992 --> 02:07.359

02:07.394 --> 02:08.894
We're still egging

we make you?

Looky here, four
more bags of candy,

02:25.445 --> 02:27.145

02:28.815 --> 02:31.016
-Where did it go?
-Where there was one,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.484
there are now two.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.486

-"Too much candy is bad
for your tummy."

ripping off the whole

04:00.607 --> 04:02.373

just tell an adult.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.746
Or we could bash
open the door.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.483
With any luck, the noise
scared the bejeebers
out of those punks.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.718
Did he really just say,
"Bejeebers?"

04:13.753 --> 04:16.521
(GIGGLES) He totally said,
"Bejeebers."

are gone.
