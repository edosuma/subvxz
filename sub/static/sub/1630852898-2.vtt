WEBVTT

00:24.200 --> 00:26.734
C’mon, let’s keep
it going, band!

00:26.767 --> 00:28.000
Woo!

00:28.033 --> 00:29.600
Let’s bring up
the party up in here!

00:31.200 --> 00:33.500
Let’s have some fun!

00:39.433 --> 00:40.600
Shit. They’re covering
their mouths left,

00:40.633 --> 00:43.066
right and center.
They can’t do that.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.967
Serial offenders!

00:47.100 --> 00:48.367
Oh... Uh oh...

00:48.400 --> 00:50.166
It’s not me!

00:50.200 --> 00:52.033
You tell ’em once, you could
tell ’em a thousand times.

00:52.066 --> 00:53.233
I can’t be out yet!

00:53.266 --> 00:55.700
If I am out,
I’m gonna be so mad!

00:58.467 --> 01:00.600
So, um...

01:00.633 --> 01:02.033
I laughed?

01:02.066 --> 01:03.834
Don’t worry. No yellow card
is gonna be given out.

01:03.867 --> 01:05.400
Is it a red one?

01:05.433 --> 01:06.433
- No!
- Oh.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.266
I wouldn’t say don’t worry.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.367
There was an infraction.
Two infractions, in fact.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.633
So, eh, everybody just
watch the fucking TV.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.834
I have to pee again, is
this gonna take a while?

01:19.867 --> 01:20.934
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh...

01:20.967 --> 01:22.033
Dammit!

01:22.066 --> 01:23.467
C’mon, let’s keep
it going, band!

01:29.667 --> 01:30.600
Ohhh.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.233
Oh, that was close.

01:35.233 --> 01:36.467
Oh, hand over mouth!

01:36.500 --> 01:37.867
Covering your mouth!

01:37.900 --> 01:40.500
When you’re trying to not laugh,
you cover your mouth.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.433
So I deserved it.
I deserved it.

01:42.467 --> 01:43.734
And so does Mae.

01:43.767 --> 01:45.033
Um, that’s cheating!

01:45.066 --> 01:46.066
Ohhhh!

01:46.100 --> 01:47.300
But, but,
not a yellow card.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.467
Two minute minor, each of you!

01:50.467 --> 01:53.600
In our... cue penalty box bit!

01:54.900 --> 01:57.967
Oh my god,
I knew there was a twist!

01:58.000 --> 01:59.500
Of course they gotta
have a hockey reference.

01:59.533 --> 02:01.633
Each of you has
a two minute minor.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.567
You gotta sit there...

02:02.600 --> 02:03.767
Oh.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.900
And all of you can
have your way with them.

02:05.934 --> 02:07.000
Yay!

02:07.033 --> 02:08.033
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

02:08.066 --> 02:09.433
Comedy-wise!

02:09.467 --> 02:10.433
Oh boy.

02:10.467 --> 02:11.467
You’re in trouble!

02:11.500 --> 02:13.066
Yeah, exactly! Exactly.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.767
Alright, guys.
Once I hit the button,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.033
the game is back on!

02:18.567 --> 02:19.166
Ahhh!

02:20.533 --> 02:21.367
Oh no!

02:21.400 --> 02:22.633
Ohhh no!

02:23.934 --> 02:25.400
And we’re back.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.567
Hey, you hear about,
uh, Asia’s newest billionaire?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.433
His name is,
uh, Cha Ching.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.333
Mmmm mmmm.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.700
This guy
asked me to send him

02:32.734 --> 02:34.734
a picture of
my naked boobs.

02:34.767 --> 02:36.367
It was like
bad children.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.333
One was looking forward,
the other one was looking back.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.800
This is terrifying!

02:40.834 --> 02:41.867
I have tears in my eyes.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.934
I’m like, my palms
are sweating.

02:43.967 --> 02:45.633
So eventually
I had to call him and say

02:45.667 --> 02:47.433
I’m gonna have to send
them one at a time.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.433


02:49.467 --> 02:51.667
One. At. A time.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.433
I think that was
my body responding

02:53.467 --> 02:56.100
to the extreme
effort of not laughing.

02:56.133 --> 02:58.000
I can’t explain the
physical feeling.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.233
Excruciating.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.533
It was
a little chaotic.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.133
I was trying to do
jokes but it was too rushed!

03:02.166 --> 03:05.734
Hey, who do you think named
the red delicious apple?

03:05.767 --> 03:08.834
’Cause he only got it half
right. Mealy as fuck!

03:08.867 --> 03:10.633
It’s not an eating apple.
It’s a pie apple.

03:11.934 --> 03:14.533
Mae Martin is
holding on for dear life!

03:14.567 --> 03:16.400
Very close. Very close.

03:16.433 --> 03:17.967
Ohhh.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.900
It is uh, difficult.

03:19.934 --> 03:23.834
It’s sort of like being
in the comedy version of 300.

03:23.867 --> 03:26.533
Ohhh.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.433
I just kind of zoned out.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.133
Oh.

03:32.533 --> 03:35.500
Potassium.
Very important.

03:35.533 --> 03:36.800
I think I’m on mushrooms.

03:38.433 --> 03:40.567
Yeah, I’m on
mushrooms right now.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.467
I’m in the forest.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.900
Good vibrations!

03:45.934 --> 03:47.900
You can’t handle the truth!

03:47.934 --> 03:49.433
Ooh.

03:49.467 --> 03:50.367
You can’t handle the fruit!

03:51.834 --> 03:54.667
And then you’re back
and like, I’m not on mushrooms!

03:54.700 --> 03:56.133
Forgot my wig for
the Johnny Carson bit.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.467
Yeah.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.667
That’s why the
jokes didn’t get a laugh.

04:00.734 --> 04:01.800
See?

04:03.600 --> 04:04.867
Isn’t it funny?

04:04.900 --> 04:06.600
I knew that Tom
was gonna get it.

04:06.633 --> 04:07.800
So I was just trying
to avoid looking at him.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.033
It’s just the
way he moves,

04:11.066 --> 04:12.867
and the sound
of his voice.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.266
Isn’t my wig funny?

04:14.300 --> 04:16.700
Oh man. I defy anyone
to get that

04:16.734 --> 04:18.266
close to Tom Green
and not laugh.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.266
It’s definitely something.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.567
Uh-oh!

04:26.233 --> 04:27.300
Oh!

04:28.867 --> 04:31.600
I don’t think I smiled!

04:31.633 --> 04:32.633
Time to be the bad guy!

04:35.467 --> 04:37.300
Not sure what
happened there.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.667
Well, well, well.
Alright guys.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.333
Uh, well, the TV will do
the heavy lifting here.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.200
And uh, Mae, you probably
wanna watch this one.

04:45.233 --> 04:46.967
Oh-ho-ho!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.033
I think I do
know what you mean!

04:49.066 --> 04:50.000
I do know the moment
you’re talking about!

04:51.367 --> 04:54.000
Isn’t my wig funny?
Isn’t it funny?

04:58.934 --> 05:00.133
I did laugh!

05:00.166 --> 05:02.000
Okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:02.033 --> 05:03.734
Again, so that’s a yellow!
I’m sorry.

05:03.767 --> 05:04.667
That’s fair.
That’s fair. That’s fair.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.467
That’s a fair yellow.
That’s a fair yellow.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.433
Don’t get too comfortable.

05:09.567 --> 05:10.266
Don’t get too
fucking comfortable.

05:13.033 --> 05:14.667
You kids
better be careful!

05:17.066 --> 05:18.700
Woo! Yeah!

05:21.433 --> 05:23.967
Mae joins Debra and
Caroline all with yellows.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.867
One more crack up
from one of them

05:25.900 --> 05:28.200
and they’re gone-zo!

05:31.967 --> 05:33.300
Charge!

05:36.000 --> 05:37.567
When I was
in the penalty box,

05:37.600 --> 05:41.066
a kind of existential
crisis set in.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.533
What is comedy?

05:44.066 --> 05:45.200
What is life?

05:46.700 --> 05:47.934
Who am I?

05:50.567 --> 05:53.266
Like, why are
any of us here...

05:53.300 --> 05:54.533
on the earth?

05:54.567 --> 05:55.533
What’s our purpose?

05:55.567 --> 05:56.867
You know what I mean?

05:56.900 --> 05:59.567
There’s nowhere
that I’m safe.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.734
I’m not safe here.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.367
I hate to say it,
but Mae Martin fans,

06:04.400 --> 06:05.667
brace for disappointment.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.100
Does no one
appreciate that you

06:12.133 --> 06:13.800
- can see my panty hose?
- Yes!

06:13.834 --> 06:16.533
I thought that we were all
going to be character-y

06:16.567 --> 06:19.100
and do some kind of attempt!

06:19.133 --> 06:20.834
The boobs are real though!

06:20.867 --> 06:22.300
The boobs are real!

06:24.300 --> 06:25.934
What do you make of
Caroline’s look?

06:25.967 --> 06:29.266
Um... I don’t know, I’m not
really one to really kind

06:29.300 --> 06:30.600
of... sort of...

06:30.633 --> 06:32.500
I wouldn’t even know
what to say, actually.

06:32.533 --> 06:33.767
Yeah. What do you mean?

06:33.800 --> 06:35.533
How would you... eh...
how would you describe it?

06:35.567 --> 06:37.200
I’m not sure what
you’re getting at.

06:37.233 --> 06:39.000
I am dressed,
like in full character

06:39.033 --> 06:41.600
and everyone else is
all in normal clothes.

06:41.633 --> 06:44.500
Right.
It’s a little confusing.

06:44.533 --> 06:47.500
We’re all Canadian so we’re too
polite to be like...

06:47.533 --> 06:52.033
What the fuck are you
wearing, Caroline?

06:55.834 --> 06:57.333
When’s the last
time you shit yourself?

06:59.066 --> 07:00.100
Oh, last year.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.333
Ah! That’s recent!

07:01.367 --> 07:02.934
Coming home
from a farmer’s market.

07:02.967 --> 07:05.033
We were driving home and then...

07:05.066 --> 07:06.767
uh... three blocks
from my house,

07:06.800 --> 07:08.900
we turned a corner
and we hit a bump.

07:08.934 --> 07:10.200
And I just shit my pants.

07:10.233 --> 07:11.834
Oh, wow.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.367
Horrible.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.066
So I was like, I’m gonna pull up
to the front of the building.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.367
You run inside.
I’ll park the car by myself.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.500
Right. It’s already happened.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.000
I can’t suck it back in.

07:20.033 --> 07:21.133
Mmmm.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.200
You can tell
when you almost got Jon.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.266
Mmm hmm.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.000
Just start audibly
agreeing with you.

07:25.033 --> 07:25.834
Mm hmm.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.667
That was his technique, to...

07:27.700 --> 07:28.800
to mask the laughter.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.233
Just go
mmm hmm, mmm hmmm.

07:31.266 --> 07:33.033
- Mmm hmm.
- Mmm hmmm.

07:33.066 --> 07:34.100
Mmm hmm.

07:34.133 --> 07:35.300
Mmm, hmmm.
Mmm, hmmm. Mmm, hmmm.

07:35.333 --> 07:39.066
Mmm. Hmmmm!
Mmmmmm.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.233
The first time
I shit myself as an adult,

07:42.266 --> 07:44.667
I was shit-faced hammered.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.533
- Oh yeah, yeah, obviously.
- Completely drunk.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.367
That’s when you’re
supposed to shit yourself.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.633
Yeah... probably a little...

07:49.667 --> 07:51.200
I misjudged a fart.

07:52.734 --> 07:54.567
Mmm. Mmmmmm.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.700
Don’t put too
much faith into a fart.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.767
Don’t... mmmm...

07:58.800 --> 08:00.934
Wiser words have
never been spoken.

08:02.734 --> 08:05.500
Good talk man. Good.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.800
I’ll be honest.
That many shit jokes

08:08.834 --> 08:11.066
is a cause for concern.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.834
You should probably get that
checked out there, Trevor.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.133
Hey, everyone.
We made an hour!

08:16.166 --> 08:17.567
Well done.
Well done everyone!

08:17.600 --> 08:19.333
Captivating
television, everybody!

08:23.500 --> 08:26.333
Can you juggle?
Can you?

08:26.367 --> 08:27.700
That’s no, so you can’t.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.100
- That’s good!
- Alright. Good answer.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.333
I had a comic when I
first started doing comedy told

08:32.367 --> 08:33.934
me if I couldn’t juggle, I’d
ever make it in this business.

08:33.967 --> 08:35.133
Same!

08:35.166 --> 08:36.467
Do you have a street
joke that you tell

08:36.500 --> 08:38.400
to, like, when you like,
go in for customs

08:38.433 --> 08:39.967
and you say
you’re a comedian?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.734
Those guys
are ready to laugh.

08:41.767 --> 08:42.533
What do
you tell them?

08:42.567 --> 08:43.734
I’m only half-Italian.

08:43.767 --> 08:46.000
Unfortunately for me,
it is the hairy half.

08:46.033 --> 08:47.533
Um, the only thing
I inherited

08:47.567 --> 08:49.934
from my father was his
eyebrow, singular.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.400
Yeah, if I do not wax
my eyebrow, every 48 hours,

08:52.433 --> 08:54.200
it will grow right
into my hairline.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.900
I could have bangs
like that.

08:57.734 --> 08:59.233
When customs asked
me to tell a joke,

08:59.266 --> 09:00.900
I said,
"Hey! How about this?

09:00.934 --> 09:03.500
Why don’t you throw
me in a holding cell?"

09:03.533 --> 09:05.667
Mmmm.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.000
Fair play.
I tell jokes for a living.

09:09.266 --> 09:12.700
I hope those
are not your nipples...

09:15.300 --> 09:17.266
Do you have a joke
that you can share?

09:17.300 --> 09:20.100
I once fell into
an upholstery machine...

09:20.133 --> 09:21.400
I’m fully recovered now!

09:24.900 --> 09:26.934
Stupid, fucking...

09:29.400 --> 09:30.867
Listen to me.
That’s not funny.

09:33.467 --> 09:34.900
I’m gonna punch you.

09:34.934 --> 09:36.300
I know I’m a laugher...

09:36.333 --> 09:39.533
...but I didn’t realize
how much I laugh all the time.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.400
And everyone is funny.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.500
It’s really hard to
keep a straight face.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.233
I’m in trouble.
I’m in trouble.

09:45.266 --> 09:46.600
Ok, a man goes
to the doctor,

09:46.633 --> 09:47.934
and he says "I feel terrible.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.233
My wife is going deaf.

09:49.266 --> 09:52.500
And so, he says listen,
there’s a very easy test.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.066
You go home..."

09:57.700 --> 09:58.533
What was that?

09:58.567 --> 09:59.600
What is that now?

09:59.633 --> 10:02.133
Is that you having an orgasm?

10:02.166 --> 10:06.967
You know, Mae has almost
smiled many times.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.600
Mae is about to fucking
break again.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.567
Hooked into the system here.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.633
I had this iPad
with sound effects on it

10:14.667 --> 10:16.934
that I thought was
gonna be a real hit.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.633
And it just bombed.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.266
Hmmm, tough crowd.
Tough crowd.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.567
- Tough crowd.
- Mmm.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.567
- Is this thing on?
- Yeah.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.834
Agh.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.333
Did you have like
an end point for this?

10:26.367 --> 10:27.867
I hadn’t.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.367
Should I do it again?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.033
I think so!

10:32.066 --> 10:33.333
Oh my God!

10:33.367 --> 10:34.467
Caroline Rhea,
like, you just wanna throw

10:34.500 --> 10:36.734
whatever you can at her.

10:36.767 --> 10:38.800
I’d like to team up on...

10:38.834 --> 10:40.400
You’d like to team up on who?

10:43.900 --> 10:44.567
No, nevermind!

10:44.600 --> 10:46.000
No one. No one.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.100
Oh. Well maybe not
speaking into the microphone

10:47.133 --> 10:49.133
when you’re making
an evil plan.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.467
I am in
the middle of a joke!

10:53.500 --> 10:55.033
Are you still
telling the deaf joke?

10:55.066 --> 10:56.300
If you don’t tell me
the end of that joke...

10:56.333 --> 10:57.834
I really wanna
hear the end of this joke.

10:57.867 --> 10:58.867
I was trying!

10:58.900 --> 11:00.533
He goes in,
he says to his wife...

11:00.567 --> 11:01.734
Wait a minute, hold on.

11:01.767 --> 11:02.767
- Hold on.
- Stop it!

11:02.800 --> 11:03.900
I forgot what
was wrong with her.

11:03.934 --> 11:05.000
- Deaf.
- Deaf.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.367
- Okay.
- Ok, she’s deaf.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.533
He goes home and says,
"Honey, what’s for dinner?"

11:07.567 --> 11:09.000
Who gave this advice?

11:09.033 --> 11:10.533
You know what?
This isn’t gonna help.

11:10.567 --> 11:11.567
If I don’t know the set up,

11:11.600 --> 11:13.900
I won’t understand
the joke...

11:15.066 --> 11:18.166
Dave Foley.
Shit disturber at large.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.066
Geez!

11:20.100 --> 11:22.200
I was trying
to do my joke again,

11:22.233 --> 11:24.633
attempting to get them.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.667
It’s not working.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.700
Oh my God.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.367
Man goes to the doctor
because his wife is

11:30.400 --> 11:31.700
going deaf and he doesn’t
know how deal with it...

11:31.734 --> 11:33.133
- Exactly.
- Doctor says "Go home.

11:33.166 --> 11:34.266
"Speak to her until
you can finally

11:34.300 --> 11:35.934
see how deaf she
really is."

11:35.967 --> 11:38.500
He goes in. "Honey, what’s
for dinner?" No response.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.000
He walks ten feet closer.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.767
"Honey, something
smells delicious.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.967
What’s for dinner?"
No response.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.166
He’s getting a little panicky.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.533
He gets a little bit closer.
He yells.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.767
"Honey, I’m so hungry!"

11:48.800 --> 11:51.400
Nothing, he gets right up
in her face and says,

11:51.433 --> 11:53.033
"Honey, what’s for dinner?"

11:53.066 --> 11:56.100
And she says, "For the fifth
time, chicken!"

11:57.166 --> 11:58.367
Oh, so he was the one.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.667
Mmmm.

11:59.700 --> 12:00.967
- Okay.
- Not funny.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.767
Okay.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.133
I honestly can’t tell if
this is going well or not.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.667
But I hope it doesn’t stop.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.834
That’s like a
Twilight Zone episode.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.700
Not one of
the better ones.

12:10.734 --> 12:11.800
This is like doing...

12:11.834 --> 12:13.100
...a re-enactment
of my last relationship.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.500
No laughing,
no smiling. No joy.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.166
Waiting for somebody to
die so you can get money.

12:26.066 --> 12:27.233
- Hello?
- Hello?

12:27.266 --> 12:28.500
What’s up?
How’s it going in there?

12:28.533 --> 12:29.867
Oh man.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.233
You know I’m sweating.
I’m drenched in sweat.

12:32.266 --> 12:33.767
Yeah, I can
fucking see that.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.233
You’ve been fucking
teetering on the edge.

12:36.266 --> 12:38.066
I know. I had
tears in my eyes.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.333
Could I get um...
could I get my foods?

12:42.367 --> 12:43.800
Lemme see if I can take
care of that for ya.

12:43.834 --> 12:44.934
Okay, thanks man.

12:44.967 --> 12:45.867
Alright, see ya!

12:45.900 --> 12:47.066
- Buh bye.
- Bye.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.967
So I have all of
these iconic British foods...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.533
...that are
absolutely revolting.

12:53.567 --> 12:56.934
Like a chocolate covered
scotch egg and like, tripe.

12:56.967 --> 13:00.200
I’m feeling
unbelievably tense.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.200
I’m scared.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.700
Are you guys eh, hungry?

13:02.734 --> 13:03.433
Yeah!

13:03.467 --> 13:04.867
Finally!
A magic act!

13:04.900 --> 13:06.567
You guys know
that I live in England?

13:06.600 --> 13:07.734
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

13:07.767 --> 13:09.000
So I actually brought
some stuff from England.

13:09.033 --> 13:10.066
- Oh sweet.
- Yay!

13:10.100 --> 13:12.633
It’s nearly lunch so...okay.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.033
There’s a blood pudding pop
right there for you, Tom.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.834
Is this real, though?

13:18.867 --> 13:19.834
Thank you so very much.

13:19.867 --> 13:20.900
Holy fuck.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.934
You shouldn’t have.
No, really.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.600
You shouldn’t have.

13:22.633 --> 13:23.667
Is it real?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.400
No, really.
You shouldn’t have.

13:24.433 --> 13:25.533
Um...

13:25.567 --> 13:27.700
It’s actually frozen
blood pudding.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.100
Wow, blood pudding pop.

13:30.133 --> 13:31.767
They’re like diarrhea pops.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.600
It smells like a scab.

13:33.633 --> 13:34.266
Oh God.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.100
Sconehenge?
Sconehenge.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.200
Great.
That’s great.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.567
Sconehenge!
I love wordplay!

13:40.600 --> 13:42.200
Funny, that’s funny.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.433
Oh, this
is all wordplay, so...

13:43.467 --> 13:44.900
I love it!

13:44.934 --> 13:46.400
I would be laughing if
I was allowed to laugh at you.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.367
Thanks, Deb.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.166
Ohhhh.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.133
Try Sconehenge?

13:49.166 --> 13:50.867
Oh! Wait,
cause it looks like it!

13:50.900 --> 13:52.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.233
It’s, um, it’s wordplay.

13:54.266 --> 13:58.066
Really it looks like it.
You change a letter. Got it!

13:58.100 --> 13:59.467
Mae was doing
something that

13:59.500 --> 14:02.233
we in the comedy
business call "bailing".

14:02.266 --> 14:03.800
You can see the wind
go out of their sails

14:03.834 --> 14:05.700
as they were wheeling
the trolley out.

14:05.734 --> 14:08.333
Watching a comedian
just completely bail.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.266
That makes me laugh.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.667
Mushy pea smoothie!
You remember that?

14:14.367 --> 14:15.333
Mushy pea smoothie?

14:15.367 --> 14:16.667
Mushy pea
smoothie for you, Dave?

14:16.700 --> 14:18.400
Gonna throw up
just on principle.

14:18.433 --> 14:19.400
Thank you.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.734
This is really killing.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.600
I think what was bleak
about the British food was

14:23.633 --> 14:26.200
knowing at that point...

14:26.233 --> 14:28.667
wordplay is not gonna
get any of these people.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.900
It’s just so hard
to keep the faith

14:30.934 --> 14:32.867
and to keep the confidence,
when you’re looking at

14:32.900 --> 14:36.033
the faces of your heroes
completely blank.

14:36.066 --> 14:38.333
That’ll haunt me forever.

14:38.367 --> 14:41.467
Oh, this is
actually pretty good.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.633
Buckingham Fallace?

14:42.667 --> 14:44.800
What’s that one?
Buckingham Fallace!

14:48.767 --> 14:51.367
I’m gonna go next.
I can tell.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.033
It’s eye contact
I can’t do!

14:56.066 --> 14:57.367
Of all the things.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.233
You shouldn’t
stand with your mouth open

14:58.266 --> 14:59.000
in front of that.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.433
Just to say, eh?

15:03.100 --> 15:05.200
Caroline and Mae,
very high brow,

15:05.233 --> 15:08.133
and both teetering on
the edge of laughter.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.033
Well, that
went really well!

15:10.066 --> 15:11.633
How can you even tell?

15:11.667 --> 15:12.967
How can you tell?

15:20.834 --> 15:24.600
We got a terlet.
No back up TP.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.633
Gonna be a problem.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.166
♪ I’m so grateful for my ♪

15:29.200 --> 15:32.166
♪ Weak bladder right now ♪

15:32.200 --> 15:35.567
Oh no! Well alright,
the shower it is.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.500
If any of you
watching the show

15:37.533 --> 15:39.500
have met
anyone over fifty,

15:39.533 --> 15:40.934
we pee a lot
more than you do.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.100
Does anyone know
when the custodians

15:44.133 --> 15:45.300
come for the bathroom?

15:46.367 --> 15:47.667
No, I don’t.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.967
’Cause it’s already
starting to turn into

15:49.000 --> 15:50.400
like a Coachella outhouse.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.900
He just got
out of the bathroom.

15:56.934 --> 15:59.934
Uh oh! That’s
a big, toothy smile.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.967
Ohhhh. Uh oh.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.066
I don’t know.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.000
Houston, we have a laugher!

16:11.033 --> 16:13.100
Oh boy...

16:13.133 --> 16:14.767
Um, alright.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.533
In the early ’80s, Saddam
Hussein purged the Baath party

16:18.567 --> 16:21.633
of all of those
he found to be disloyal.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.900
They all sat there, sweating,
as he pulled them out of the

16:23.934 --> 16:25.433
audience one by one.

16:25.467 --> 16:28.700
Each person didn’t know if
their name would be called next

16:28.734 --> 16:30.600
because Saddam was crazy.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.800
Anyway, watch this.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.033
Very funny lead in,
by the way.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.834
Does anyone know
when the custodians

16:36.867 --> 16:38.300
come for the bathroom?

16:38.333 --> 16:39.533
No, I don’t.

16:39.567 --> 16:40.967
It’s already starting
to turn into, like,

16:41.000 --> 16:41.967
a Coachella outhouse.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.500
He just got
out of the bathroom.

16:45.533 --> 16:46.533
Oh, I see.

16:50.033 --> 16:51.633
You broke Dave!
You know the rules.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.233
So, that counts
as a yellow, buddy.

16:54.266 --> 16:55.600
That’s one infraction
against you.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.066
Alright.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.533
With Dave, I was like,
I don’t know how to get you.

16:59.567 --> 17:03.967
And then, he broke himself.
Oh damn!

17:04.000 --> 17:06.166
Well, that was a relief! Oh!

17:07.200 --> 17:09.066
Well done.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.266
Woo!

17:11.300 --> 17:12.500
Let’s get it!

17:15.333 --> 17:18.400
Dave Foley with the yellow
card. So that’s four comedians

17:18.433 --> 17:20.600
on the brink of
getting the boot.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.500
We really need a broom.

17:24.533 --> 17:26.900
We do need a broom.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.467
Be Careful.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.066
How are you doing?

17:35.100 --> 17:37.400
I don’t know.
I think I’m okay.

17:39.467 --> 17:40.934
What’s that?

17:43.734 --> 17:45.033
I feel something’s happening.

17:45.066 --> 17:46.567
Something’s
happening here.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.700
Whoa!

17:54.734 --> 17:57.567
What the fuck?
Holy shit!

17:57.600 --> 17:59.867
NHL star P.K. Subban
in the house!

18:02.166 --> 18:05.867
Oh, it’s like, okay.
What is this?

18:05.900 --> 18:09.734
P.K. comes in, ’cause who’s
funnier than a hockey player?

18:09.767 --> 18:11.767
Don’t mind me, guys!
I’m just watching.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.100
Pernell-Karl Subban,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.033
76, the one and only.

18:16.066 --> 18:18.100
My one and only.

18:18.133 --> 18:20.166
Welcome!
Welcome to the gang.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.934
P.K.’s in the room.
What the hell?

18:22.967 --> 18:24.100
You’re just gonna hang out?

18:24.133 --> 18:25.867
Just gonna
hang out. Chill.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.300
Wicked slapshot, by the way.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.266
He plays sports.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.200
Look at them all,
gathered around.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.300
It’s very cute.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.467
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.767
Jon Lajoie!

18:32.800 --> 18:34.767
No, no, that’s uh...
that’s Jon Lajoie.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.700
No, just go with it.
Go with it.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.033
I’m Jon La... Yes.

18:37.066 --> 18:37.700
Yes. Yes.

18:37.734 --> 18:39.066
Jon Lajoie!

18:39.100 --> 18:40.166
Hi!

18:40.200 --> 18:42.800
Hey! Dave Foley!
Oh my God!

18:42.834 --> 18:44.066
Thank you!

18:44.100 --> 18:44.767
I’ve aged quite a bit
in the last few years.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.667
I like that shirt!

18:45.700 --> 18:46.800
Oh, thank you!

18:46.834 --> 18:48.567
Not really,
but it’s decent.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.800
- You know what?
- It works for you!

18:49.834 --> 18:51.033
I’m fine with decent!

18:51.066 --> 18:53.834
What, what is this even?

18:53.867 --> 18:55.300
Where’s the, uh,
washroom around here?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.500
Um, just go anywhere.

18:57.533 --> 18:59.066
Honestly, that’s what
I’ve been doing.

18:59.100 --> 18:59.834
I gotta piss.

18:59.867 --> 19:01.166
Okay, alright.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.567
All of a sudden,
he’s just like saying

19:02.600 --> 19:04.567
that he had to
go to the bathroom.

19:04.600 --> 19:09.133
So obviously, I told him
that he can go in the fridge.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.200
He decided to go
with the bottle.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.133
- Yeah...
- Just, I gotta go.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.400
Okay. Oh
boy. Oh boy.

19:14.433 --> 19:16.600
I just gotta go pee so...
just hang on a sec here.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.600
Oh, okay. Okay!

19:17.633 --> 19:18.967
What the fuck
are you doing?

19:21.934 --> 19:23.800
Oh my God!

19:23.834 --> 19:27.867
P.K. taking a
pee-pee in a bottle.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.700
Normal day at the office.

19:29.734 --> 19:32.066
I’m not gonna
be that long!

19:32.100 --> 19:35.033
Weird choice, but at
least it was a number one.

19:36.934 --> 19:39.266
Am I for real watching P.K.
Subban pee into a bottle?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.033
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

19:41.066 --> 19:43.433
I got a little
bit of stage fright here.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.734
Oh man. Mortified.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.667
And I’m not even in there.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.200
I don’t have my glasses on.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.400
P.K. Subban.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.633
He’s gonna be in
the hall of fame someday.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.166
But one thing that
P.K. Subban cannot do

19:55.200 --> 19:57.567
is get a laugh
with his ass.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.400
Sorry about that.
False alarm, guys.

19:59.433 --> 20:01.633
You have a very nice butt.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.266
I’m sure if I devoted
my life to, to,

20:04.300 --> 20:06.200
being physically fit,
I’d have a nice butt, too.

20:06.233 --> 20:08.000
So there, P.K.
If you wanna get a

20:08.033 --> 20:10.500
laugh on your ass,
stop working out.

20:10.533 --> 20:11.900
Alright guys.
Nice meeting ya!

20:11.934 --> 20:14.033
Thank you, man.
Good to see ya man!

20:14.066 --> 20:14.700
You don’t wanna
shake my hand? Okay.

20:14.734 --> 20:15.734
Yeah, I get that.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.533
Yeah, you probably
wanna do that.

20:18.567 --> 20:19.800
Thank you for your time.

20:19.834 --> 20:20.834
Alright!

20:20.867 --> 20:23.367
What happened to
family entertainment?

20:23.400 --> 20:24.967
Jay!

20:25.000 --> 20:28.300
Aww....
How’s it going buddy!

20:28.333 --> 20:29.467
It’s good to see you, bud!

20:29.500 --> 20:30.700
Likewise!

20:30.734 --> 20:32.367
- This is awesome!
- Fuck, man!

20:32.400 --> 20:34.266
I think that was a little
bit of a curveball for ’em.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.767
It was a lot
of a curveball!

20:36.800 --> 20:38.066
Did you get
a good ass shot?

20:38.100 --> 20:39.300
Did you see my ass?

20:39.333 --> 20:41.767
Of course. Everybody did.
All of Canada will.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.367
Great! Yes.
I’m gonna head out.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.233
Okay, try to keep
your pants on...

20:50.033 --> 20:51.767
We are playing for
these amazing charities.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.133
But I thought, could I use
that as a part of my comedy?

20:54.166 --> 20:55.834
I got these
photos done up.

20:55.867 --> 20:56.934
Maybe this will work.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.066
Who’s the kid with penis arms?

20:59.100 --> 21:00.533
Yeah, that’s Pete.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.633
He’s, uh, he found his mom’s
dildo in a drawer

21:02.667 --> 21:05.767
and the dildo fluids
got into a cut he had

21:05.800 --> 21:08.133
and then next thing you know,
his arms became giant dildos.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.233
So I’m playing for
Pete and an entire

21:09.266 --> 21:10.767
generation of
dildo arm kids.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.300
Yup.
Yeah, he has dildos.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.400
Once they hit college,
people love them.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.166
But before, there’s a
stigma against dildo arms.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.967
I’m gonna be honest,
I’d be more likely

21:21.000 --> 21:22.667
to believe that he was
born with dick arms

21:22.700 --> 21:24.633
than that he acquired
the dick arms.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.266
No, no, no.
That’s the surprising thing.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.567
Hey man, if you’re willing
to get out of the game,

21:28.600 --> 21:30.400
let this dildo arms kid
have a chance, man.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.133
You gotta give
him a chance!

21:32.633 --> 21:34.967
Well, you know
I love kids with dicks for arms.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.066
Yeah.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.600
Uh oh!

21:38.633 --> 21:41.667
Dildo arms will fuckin’
get you every time.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.133
Hoo hoo.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.166
You alright?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.734
I am hanging in there.

21:51.567 --> 21:52.967
You’re making
grilled cheese?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.934
Making some grilled cheese if
anyone wants one. You want one?

21:54.967 --> 21:56.533
- Yeah, I do actually. Yeah.
- Sure.

21:56.567 --> 21:57.834
Are you making
grilled cheese sandwiches?

21:57.867 --> 21:59.166
Yeah I am.
Eh, would you like one?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.100
- I would like one please.
- Oh my God, yeah!

22:01.133 --> 22:02.467
Is there
the remains of one testicle

22:02.500 --> 22:05.300
in this sandwich?

22:05.333 --> 22:06.700
Uh, nope. Nope.

22:06.734 --> 22:09.433
I’ve only got one left.
I’m not using it for this.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.734
Oh, Jesus Christ.

22:11.767 --> 22:12.967
So you have one testicle?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.400
I do. I had cancer!

22:14.433 --> 22:15.166
Oh, you did!

22:15.200 --> 22:16.467
It was from cancer!

22:16.500 --> 22:17.934
Hey.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.333
I’m so disgusted with myself

22:19.367 --> 22:21.500
at how attractive
I find Tom Green.

22:21.533 --> 22:22.767
See, I get it, though.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.000
I like that look.
I always go for that look.

22:25.033 --> 22:27.100
- He’s adorable.
- Long hair and beard. He’s tall.

22:27.133 --> 22:28.767
He’s weird.
What’s not to like?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.500
This is ever a delicious
cheese sandwich.

22:31.533 --> 22:32.900
Tom Green is secretly hot.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.600
He’s like a subtle, hilarious,
brilliant little genius.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.300
Like that was unexpected.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.100
Who wants
someone boring and normal?

22:41.133 --> 22:44.000
Mmm hmm, and this again,
the one testicle helps.

22:44.033 --> 22:45.500
I don’t need
a lot down there.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.300
Do you know what I mean?
In terms of testicles.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.100
- How would anyone know?
- No one would ever know.

22:49.133 --> 22:50.367
How would anyone know?
Aren’t they a set?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.700
Don’t they live
in the same bunk bed?

22:51.734 --> 22:54.100
Don’t they?
I thought they did. Don’t they?

22:55.600 --> 22:57.533
We didn’t listen
during gym class.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.433
And he cooks?

22:59.467 --> 23:01.400
I want a sandwich
before I’m ejected.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.367
Care for a
grilled cheese?

23:02.400 --> 23:04.000
- Thanks!
- There you go.

23:04.033 --> 23:05.066
Care for a grilled cheese?

23:05.100 --> 23:06.266
Yeah, I do!
That’s hot, though!

23:06.300 --> 23:07.900
Take the plate
if you’d like.

23:07.934 --> 23:09.500
Just thought people might
be getting a little hungry.

23:09.533 --> 23:13.633
It’s a delicious
cheese sandwich.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.233
A delicious
cheese sandwich.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.900
Isn’t that delicious?

23:20.934 --> 23:23.667
Isn’t that a
delicious cheese sandwich?

23:25.233 --> 23:26.533
Tom Green.

23:26.567 --> 23:29.533
It’s like he’s adding
syllables into words.

23:29.567 --> 23:32.266
Delicious cheese sandwiches.

23:32.300 --> 23:36.834
Isn’t that a delicious
cheese sandwich?

23:36.867 --> 23:39.500
And the repetition.
Oh my God.

23:39.533 --> 23:44.133
A delicious cheese sandwich.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.200
Yeah.

23:49.934 --> 23:51.166
Thanks man.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.400
It is a game and the goal
is to make people laugh.

23:56.433 --> 23:59.266
So when I saw that I was
maybe making some progress

23:59.300 --> 24:01.467
with the delicious
cheese sandwich thing,

24:01.500 --> 24:04.900
I... I did kinda go
in on Mae pretty hard with

24:04.934 --> 24:07.700
the delicious cheese
sandwiches thing.

24:07.734 --> 24:10.300
Mae.
Tell everyone.

24:10.333 --> 24:13.500
How was my delicious
cheese sandwich?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.467
Mae tried it.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.834
I made delicious
cheese sandwiches.

24:20.867 --> 24:21.834
They are delicious.

24:21.867 --> 24:23.767
Mae had one.
Correct, Mae?

24:23.800 --> 24:27.700
Mae had a delicious
cheese sandwich.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.967
Maybe say it again.
It’s working.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.934
The bit’s got legs.

24:31.967 --> 24:34.033
Mae likes my
cheese sandwiches.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.333
Mae likes my
cheese sandwiches.

24:38.367 --> 24:39.500
Are they
delicious cheese sandwiches?

24:39.533 --> 24:41.000
They are delicious.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.266
They are made out
of delicious cheese.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.967
They are delicious
cheese sandwiches.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.100
Mae.

24:47.133 --> 24:49.767
It’s not funny and
you’re fine.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.033
Think of awful stuff.

24:52.066 --> 24:53.600
I will make some more.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.867
Mae, I’m gonna
make some more.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.800
I can’t.
I think you should stop.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.967
Should I stop making them?

25:00.066 --> 25:01.433
I would happily eat

25:01.467 --> 25:02.433
a delicious cheese sandwich
if you’re making them.

25:02.467 --> 25:03.433
Oh no.

25:03.467 --> 25:04.700
Okay, Trevor,
would you like a

25:04.734 --> 25:06.033
- delicious cheese sandwich?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:06.066 --> 25:08.166
I would like a
delicious cheese sandwich.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.433
Mae, very good.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.367
Very good poker
face, Mae Martin.

25:15.700 --> 25:16.667
Can I tell
you something funny?

25:16.700 --> 25:17.367
What?

25:17.400 --> 25:19.600
When I was on...

25:19.633 --> 25:20.734
Sabrina?

25:20.767 --> 25:21.967
- When I was on Sabrina.
- Yes.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.834
They had a puzzle
made of the three of us.

25:23.867 --> 25:27.333
Oh damn! Uh oh.

25:27.367 --> 25:30.300
And my double chin was a
separate piece of the puzzle.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.800
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Shut up.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.767
Oh shit!
Almost laughed.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.133
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

25:40.533 --> 25:41.734
You’re too much.

25:42.567 --> 25:44.367
You’re too much.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.700
Ms. Caroline,
she’s so funny.

25:46.734 --> 25:49.367
She looks you in the
eye and she’s trying to like,

25:49.400 --> 25:51.767
analyze you and figure out
what’s making you laugh.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.133
She was
working her magic on me.

25:53.166 --> 25:54.400
What about this?

25:54.433 --> 25:57.633
Oh shit, here we go.
Caroline going in for the kill.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.834
Brandon could be toast.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.667
How much will
this freak out Mae?

26:02.700 --> 26:03.567
Freak out Mae?

26:03.600 --> 26:05.767
If I go in like...

26:08.700 --> 26:09.667
Oh my God!

26:09.700 --> 26:11.533
Uh oh! Uh oh!

26:11.567 --> 26:13.133
Okay, what happened?

26:13.166 --> 26:14.133
What’s it gonna be?

26:14.166 --> 26:15.300
Yellow card?
Red card?

26:16.633 --> 26:18.600
Oh! They woke the band!

26:23.734 --> 26:26.233
Wow!
Smells like grilled cheese!

26:29.934 --> 26:34.934
Yeah, so without further ado,
just watch the friggin’ TV.

26:34.967 --> 26:37.266
What about this?

26:37.300 --> 26:40.266
How much will this
freak out Mae?

26:40.300 --> 26:41.367
Freak out Mae? Yeah.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.367
Uh oh.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.867
That, ladies and gentlemen...

26:51.900 --> 26:54.133
- I’m gone.
- First red card of the game!

26:54.166 --> 26:55.700
I’m so furious!

26:55.734 --> 26:59.467
Me going ’ha’,
got me off the show!

26:59.500 --> 27:00.667
My God!

27:00.700 --> 27:01.800
That’s a...

27:01.834 --> 27:03.333
I get to be with
Jay so I’m so happy!

27:03.367 --> 27:05.166
Honourable,
noble way to go out.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.300
That’s a good reason
to get eliminated.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.500
You know what, it is.

27:07.533 --> 27:08.667
I laughed at my own joke.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.934
Awww.

27:09.967 --> 27:11.633
Thank you,
it’s been a pleasure.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.934
Caroline. Caroline.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.266
So amazing.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.867
Bye Caroline!

27:17.900 --> 27:18.834
Bye everybody!

27:18.867 --> 27:20.800
- Bye!
- Bye!

27:20.834 --> 27:22.133
Stay strong, Deb!

27:23.333 --> 27:25.100
- How do you feel?
- Thank God!

27:26.233 --> 27:27.266
Thank God!

27:27.300 --> 27:30.700
Somebody’s gotta be the first.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.467
Come sit with me here.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.767
I get a special chair?

27:33.800 --> 27:34.934
It’s okay.

27:34.967 --> 27:36.500
I wanted something else
to regret in my life.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.200
That’s why I
did this show.

27:38.233 --> 27:41.066
Caroline is the
first eliminated!

27:41.100 --> 27:43.700
Her consolation
prize? Me!

27:46.100 --> 27:48.900
Welcome. So you corpsed, eh?

27:48.934 --> 27:50.934
You know why?
Because women are generous

27:50.967 --> 27:54.533
and men are like,
"I’m not laughing, no way!"

27:54.567 --> 27:56.934
Yeah. I’m not
gonna touch that one.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.567
It’s the truth!

27:58.600 --> 28:00.233
- You wanna hit the green?
- And do what?

28:00.266 --> 28:01.266
Just, just hit
the green button.

28:03.734 --> 28:06.000
Okay, we’re back!

28:09.200 --> 28:10.633
- Oh...
- Oh.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.000
Oh, here we go. Yeah!

28:15.033 --> 28:16.367
Should we play the blues?

28:19.033 --> 28:20.500
I guess it was a
matter of time before

28:20.533 --> 28:22.266
this turned
into hippie jam!

28:23.500 --> 28:24.734
Hey, check
out our song.

28:24.767 --> 28:26.367

29:53.266 --> 29:55.467
The only way I
could keep from laughing...

29:55.500 --> 29:57.400
