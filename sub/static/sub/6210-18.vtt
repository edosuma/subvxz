00:01.200 --> 00:02.634
Toast is up.

00:02.635 --> 00:04.102
That's odd. We weren't
making toast.

00:05.737 --> 00:07.072
Oh, no!

00:08.440 --> 00:09.808
It's a chain letter.

00:09.809 --> 00:12.077
There are no metaphors
in the Other Realm, are there?

00:12.078 --> 00:14.312
Other Realm chain letters
are the worst.

00:14.313 --> 00:16.647
If we don't immediately
send strong iron chains

00:16.648 --> 00:19.917
to 20 other people,
horrible things will befall us.

00:19.918 --> 00:22.353
Okay, so which of my dearest
friends do I hate the most?

00:22.354 --> 00:23.488
Stop right there.

00:23.489 --> 00:26.024
Bad luck is not brought on
by silly superstitions

00:26.025 --> 00:27.459
like chain letters.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.761
You're right. They're
brought on by black cats.

00:29.762 --> 00:31.830
That is a hateful
stereotype.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.865
It's brought on
by midgets in dresses.

00:34.867 --> 00:35.867
Give me that.

00:37.236 --> 00:39.704
We are gonna throw
this chain letter away...

00:39.705 --> 00:41.939
and nothing horrible
will happen.

00:45.477 --> 00:47.913
I'm sure this is
just a coincidence.

If the in-flight movie's bad,

01:07.766 --> 01:08.799
I'm jumping.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.840
A "B"?
What did you get?

01:15.841 --> 01:17.775
A C-minus?

01:17.776 --> 01:19.110
Wow. This is the first time

01:19.111 --> 01:20.811
I ever got
a better grade than you.

01:20.812 --> 01:22.713
Yep. It's my paper.

01:22.714 --> 01:24.315
"Your characters
are undeveloped,

01:24.316 --> 01:25.850
and your plot
seems contrived."

01:25.851 --> 01:27.451
Of course it's contrived.
I made it up.

01:27.452 --> 01:29.687
Hey. I got a C-plus.
What did you get?

01:29.688 --> 01:31.056
She got a C-minus.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.790
Sabrina got
a C-minus?

01:32.791 --> 01:35.760
Sabrina, the genius,
got a C-minus.

01:35.761 --> 01:37.795
I always feel the minus
part is personal.

01:37.796 --> 01:40.565
I've never gotten
a C-minus in my whole life.

01:40.566 --> 01:42.299
( <i>slow, lethargic</i>

01:42.300 --> 01:45.036
( chortles )

01:45.037 --> 01:46.738
( bell rings )
I got to talk to Mr. Franco.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.840
And remember to floss.

01:48.841 --> 01:50.075
Mr. Franco, I wanted
to talk to you

01:50.076 --> 01:51.509
about this C-minus
I got on my paper.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.044
I'm sure you'll
do better next time.

01:53.045 --> 01:54.779
Well, I'm horribly upset
about it this time.

01:54.780 --> 01:56.547
I've kind of grown
accustomed to getting A's.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.416
They really cushion the blow
when I get a pimple,

01:58.417 --> 02:00.051
or I have to climb
the rope in gym class.

02:00.052 --> 02:02.186
Sabrina, everyone gets
a C once in a while,

02:02.187 --> 02:03.955
and no one can climb
the rope in gym class.

02:03.956 --> 02:06.024
It's there to humiliate people.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.193
I should have trusted my
instincts and taken Metal Shop.

02:08.193 --> 02:09.994
Hey. I got to get to
gym class.

02:09.995 --> 02:11.462
We get to climb
the rope today.

02:12.832 --> 02:16.200
( muffled speech )

02:16.201 --> 02:17.702
So to recap...

02:17.703 --> 02:21.139
You have done nothing to
respond to this chain letter?

02:22.674 --> 02:25.143
You both held
your tongues. Excellent.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.478
You will find the best way
to stop a chain letter

02:27.479 --> 02:29.147
is to simply ignore it.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.415
( both mumbling )

02:30.416 --> 02:33.184
Let's let the professionals
track down the culprit

02:33.185 --> 02:34.686
and bring him to justice.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.987
( speaking incoherently )

02:36.988 --> 02:38.389
You can't lose faith.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.225
Because if I must say so myself,

02:40.226 --> 02:43.961
I think all of us
are doing a pretty good job.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.598
Ladies.

02:46.599 --> 02:47.532
( muffled speech )

02:49.301 --> 02:50.734
Oh. Ah.

02:50.735 --> 02:54.605
Well, we can't catch
everybody now, can we?

02:54.606 --> 02:56.975
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

02:56.976 --> 02:59.377
Sabrina...is something
bothering you?

02:59.378 --> 03:01.946
You look like I do when I've
accidentally eaten apricots.

03:01.947 --> 03:05.182
Heh. Your larynx hasn't
collapsed, has it?

03:05.183 --> 03:06.884
No. I'm just working hard
on this story.

03:06.885 --> 03:09.687
I got a C-minus on the last one.
I heard.

03:09.688 --> 03:12.690
I'm working hard to prove
it was an aberration.

03:12.691 --> 03:14.359
Oh, then, I'm sure
this one is wonderful.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.893
Uh, let me
hear some.

03:15.894 --> 03:17.862
Okay. Well, it's supposed
to be a genre piece,

03:17.863 --> 03:19.230
so I picked romance.

03:19.231 --> 03:20.799
"Clare looked at Robert,

03:20.800 --> 03:22.366
"and Robert looked at Clare.

03:22.367 --> 03:24.502
"Clare and Robert
were looking at each other.

03:24.503 --> 03:26.203
"Clare didn't
want to fall in love,

03:26.204 --> 03:28.206
"but nothing in her
crazy life made sense,

03:28.207 --> 03:30.808
and she lost all feeling
in her thumbs."

03:30.809 --> 03:32.877
You don't have to be
good at everything.

03:32.878 --> 03:35.146
Well, if it
isn't "C-brina."

03:36.582 --> 03:38.016
Perhaps you can
improve your grades

03:38.017 --> 03:39.918
by studying
in detention.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.319
Detention? What did I do?

03:41.320 --> 03:44.622
Even John Grisham has
to pick up his trash.

03:44.623 --> 03:45.923
Hm, missy?

03:45.924 --> 03:48.092
Or should I say,
Miss-C Minus?

03:48.093 --> 03:49.060
( laughing )

03:52.097 --> 03:53.397
More sugar for your tea?

03:53.398 --> 03:56.000
Oh. Oh! This is
more awkward

03:56.001 --> 03:58.002
than when we had lunch
with The Elephant Man.

03:58.003 --> 03:59.336
Please let me send
the chain letters

03:59.337 --> 04:01.405
and get rid of these
annoying curses. Please.

04:01.406 --> 04:03.474
No! We are taking
the postmaster's advice

04:03.475 --> 04:04.776
and not giving in.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.944
Fine. Then get
your big, fat hand

04:06.945 --> 04:08.212
out of my way.

04:08.213 --> 04:10.014
You get your big,
fat hand out of my way.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.917
Oh!
Oh!

04:12.918 --> 04:14.685
Oh!
Ow!

04:14.686 --> 04:16.754
You broke my big, fat nail.

04:18.156 --> 04:20.757
Hey, shouldn't you be
working on your story?

04:20.759 --> 04:22.626
I'm trying to find
some stupid inspiration

04:22.627 --> 04:24.228
to write my stupid story.

04:24.229 --> 04:26.464
I recommended she watch
this spy movie.

04:26.465 --> 04:28.600
Is this movie
helping you at all?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.702
Well, so far, it's about
a very handsome spy

04:30.703 --> 04:33.304
who drives a sports car with
machine guns in the headlights,

04:33.305 --> 04:35.707
beautiful women, an evil
scientist with an eye patch,

04:35.708 --> 04:37.008
more beautiful women,

04:37.009 --> 04:38.576
and a plot to corner
the uranium market.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.045
But I'm only
ten minutes in.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.980
Maybe you'd be
more inspired

04:41.981 --> 04:44.682
if you had the classic
accouterments of a writer.

04:44.683 --> 04:47.284
Gin, night sweats
and a bad marriage?

04:47.285 --> 04:49.620
I was talking about
my old manual typewriter.

04:49.621 --> 04:52.690
It always used to inspire me
when I was in college.

04:52.691 --> 04:54.492
I think it's still
up in the attic.

04:54.493 --> 04:55.560
Well...

04:55.561 --> 04:57.328
I'll try anything.

04:57.329 --> 04:59.597
Beats sitting around here
with Salem yelling,

04:59.598 --> 05:02.400
"Bring it on, baby," every time
there's a woman on the screen.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.004
Okay. Here
goes nothing.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.305
Hopefully,
a well-written nothing.

05:08.306 --> 05:09.907
Let's see.

05:09.908 --> 05:13.411
International spy, Derek Kink,

05:13.412 --> 05:16.180
has been given
the assignment of stopping--

05:16.181 --> 05:18.149
I need a villain

05:18.150 --> 05:20.484
--Dr. Bad.

05:21.987 --> 05:23.254
Fix that later.

05:23.255 --> 05:26.423
Uh... An evil scientist

05:26.424 --> 05:27.925
bent on taking over
the world...

05:27.926 --> 05:30.527
Ha! I'm good. Wow.

05:30.528 --> 05:32.930
Soon, my face will be on
the side of Barnes & Noble bags.

05:37.769 --> 05:38.703
( thunder crashes )

05:38.704 --> 05:40.939
( laughs )

05:40.940 --> 05:42.173
Hilda!

05:42.174 --> 05:44.541
Go away! I am mailing
these chain letters tonight

05:44.542 --> 05:46.343
and getting rid
of these wolf ears!

05:46.344 --> 05:47.478
No!
Yes!

05:47.479 --> 05:48.746
( siren wailing )

05:50.015 --> 05:52.150
( both howling )

05:56.721 --> 05:57.622
Where were we?

05:57.623 --> 05:58.757
Yes!
No!

05:58.758 --> 05:59.757
Yes!
No!

06:01.593 --> 06:03.427
I aced my story.
I just know it.

06:03.428 --> 06:04.629
I might have blown mine.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.131
I wrote a techno-thriller,
but I set it in the '20s.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.102
C? But that's
impossible!

06:11.103 --> 06:12.904
I typed it on
a manual typewriter.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.505
The same kind
William Faulkner used

06:14.506 --> 06:17.008
when he wasn't passed out
drunk on the veranda.

06:17.009 --> 06:17.875
( bell rings )

06:17.876 --> 06:19.377
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

06:19.378 --> 06:22.379
I've gotten so many Cs,
my next one's free.

06:22.380 --> 06:25.183
And if it makes you
feel any worse...

06:25.184 --> 06:26.183
I got a B.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.887
Can I talk to you
about this?

06:29.888 --> 06:31.089
Sure.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.223
I thought this story
was better,

06:32.224 --> 06:34.425
but it had some of the same
problems as the first one.

06:34.426 --> 06:36.394
Even though the spy genre
was a good choice,

06:36.395 --> 06:38.329
characters didn't
seem real.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.330
Didn't seem real?

06:39.331 --> 06:41.031
But I based them all
on real people.

06:41.032 --> 06:43.534
I mean, come on,
Dr. Bad, an evil scientist

06:43.535 --> 06:45.770
who kills teenagers
with detention slips of death.

06:45.771 --> 06:48.105
Sound like a certain
"Krafty" vice principal?

06:48.106 --> 06:51.075
You give much thought
to that name, "Dr. Bad"?

06:51.076 --> 06:54.245
W-- And-- And "Derek Kink"?
Harvey Kinkle.

06:54.246 --> 06:56.680
I mean, it was
practically nonfiction.

06:56.681 --> 06:58.749
That's not
character development.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.486
A good writer knows everything
about her characters:

07:01.487 --> 07:03.621
their history, their
strengths and weaknesses,

07:03.622 --> 07:05.523
<i>and</i> what motivates them.

07:06.658 --> 07:09.360
I put it in a nice binder.

07:09.361 --> 07:10.361
Ugh.

07:10.362 --> 07:11.629
Shirt untucked.

07:12.964 --> 07:14.198
I drew straight
from life.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.334
SABRINA:
Dr. Bad?

07:20.472 --> 07:22.707
Here's your detention slip...

07:22.708 --> 07:24.041
of death.

07:24.042 --> 07:26.077

07:26.078 --> 07:27.578
Oh, no. My characters
have come to life.

07:27.579 --> 07:29.747
And that means
that student's about to die.

07:34.486 --> 07:36.387
All I did was wear
my skates to school.

07:43.095 --> 07:46.029
And Mr. Franco said that
my characters weren't real.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.765
I've got to stop Dr. Bad.

07:47.766 --> 07:48.766
( gasps )

07:48.767 --> 07:50.335
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

07:50.336 --> 07:52.203
Ah, Lydia.

07:52.204 --> 07:53.604
Lydia
Kissenkill,

07:53.605 --> 07:56.740
my favorite
double agent.
( giggles )

07:56.741 --> 07:59.076
And this is my newest weapon:
Mm.

07:59.077 --> 08:00.878
The pom bomb.

08:00.879 --> 08:02.579
A cheerleader
tosses it at someone,

08:02.580 --> 08:04.581
say, a spy...

08:04.582 --> 08:07.551
and then, rah-rah,
sis-boom.

08:07.552 --> 08:09.086
Oh, dear. His head
came off.

08:09.087 --> 08:10.621
Oh!
( giggles )

08:10.622 --> 08:12.189
It's marvelous what they can do

08:12.190 --> 08:15.259
with a little crepe paper
and plastic explosives.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.027
( giggles )
( cackles )

08:18.631 --> 08:19.530
Oh!

08:19.531 --> 08:21.566
About your crashing GPA.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.868
There's an enrichment program
for remedial students.

08:23.869 --> 08:25.837
They have chocolate milk.
And once a year,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.672
they take a trip
to the zoo.

08:29.575 --> 08:30.808
How did magic get
into my story?

08:30.809 --> 08:32.876
I have to get home
and talk to my aunts.

08:32.878 --> 08:34.178
Valerie.
Vivian.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.246
Oh, right.

08:35.246 --> 08:36.614
Vivian Soontodie,

08:36.615 --> 08:38.582
the beautiful agent
who works with Derek Kink.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.418
And UNICEF.
We have to meet Derek.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.352
I'd love to, but I really
have to get home.

08:42.354 --> 08:44.789
I have a black belt
in 24 disciplines

08:44.790 --> 08:46.290
of Oriental
martial arts.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.959
Then clearly,
I'm coming with you.

08:49.828 --> 08:51.028
Harvey?

08:51.029 --> 08:53.264
Kink's the name.
Derek Kink.

08:53.265 --> 08:55.266
Of the European
Special Service.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.334
( sighs )

08:56.335 --> 08:58.135
Pineapple smoothie?

08:58.136 --> 09:00.338
Derek, we have to
get to our briefing.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.106
Right.
And I have to get home.

09:02.107 --> 09:04.575
Oh. Hey, you're making me
spill my smoothie.

09:04.576 --> 09:06.110
Ah. Mrs. Doohickey.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.879
No time for
niceties, Kink.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.980
We have the special equipment

09:08.981 --> 09:10.815
you'll be needing
for this assignment.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.150
These seemingly
innocent-looking erasers

09:13.151 --> 09:14.218
when clapped together

09:14.219 --> 09:16.120
emit a poisonous gas.

09:16.121 --> 09:16.987
( magic chimes )

09:20.025 --> 09:21.926
Chalk up another success.

09:21.927 --> 09:24.061
Fortunately, the effects
are only temporary.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.629
Well, good luck with
your weapons and poison.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.299
I'll just toddle along.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.700
( shrieks )

09:29.701 --> 09:31.102
You okay?

09:31.103 --> 09:33.003
Yeah. Um, that
last scream

09:33.004 --> 09:34.605
really cleared up
my sinuses.

09:34.606 --> 09:35.973
Are you going
to lunch?

09:35.974 --> 09:37.908
Can't. I got to go home
and figure out...

09:37.909 --> 09:39.677
why I forgot my lunch.

09:42.147 --> 09:44.448
ZELDA:
I don't like this show.
Do you have the remote?

09:44.449 --> 09:46.551
HILDA:
No. I foolishly forgot
to pick it up

09:46.552 --> 09:48.819
before I unexpectedly
grew 8 feet.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.320
I'm going to blame
the altitude

09:50.321 --> 09:51.622
for your rudeness.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.758
The characters
in my story are alive.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.196
Thank goodness my home can be
a shelter from the madness.

09:59.197 --> 10:00.731
HILDA:
Sabrina, could you speak up?

10:00.732 --> 10:02.200
It's hard to hear you
from up here.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.068
The people in my spy story,
they came to life,

10:04.069 --> 10:05.702
and they're running
around my school.

10:05.703 --> 10:07.305
The only way that
could possibly happen

10:07.306 --> 10:09.907
is if you accidentally used
Hilda's magic typewriter,

10:09.908 --> 10:12.643
but she got rid of that
years ago, didn't you, Hilda?

10:12.644 --> 10:16.080
By "get rid of" you don't
mean "kept," do you?

10:16.081 --> 10:17.314
Hilda.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.283
I'm sorry. I know I was
supposed to give it away,

10:19.284 --> 10:21.018
but I just-- I love
writing romance stories

10:21.019 --> 10:23.988
with myself as the heroine, and
then watching them come to life.

10:23.989 --> 10:25.489
It isn't pathetic, is it?

10:25.490 --> 10:26.657
Can we come up
with a solution?

10:26.658 --> 10:28.192
There's a group
of international spies

10:28.193 --> 10:29.359
running around
my school.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.795
And my neck is killing me.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.264
Oh, dear.
What kind of an ending

10:33.265 --> 10:35.098
did you write
for your story?

10:35.099 --> 10:36.668
Well, it was late,
and I was really tired,

10:36.669 --> 10:38.636
so I just had Dr. Bad...

10:38.637 --> 10:39.937
When this bomb goes off,

10:39.938 --> 10:41.772
all the teenagers
will be annihilated,

10:41.773 --> 10:43.774
and everyone will think
they were killed

10:43.775 --> 10:47.311
in a science lab experiment
gone terribly awry.

10:47.312 --> 10:49.180
( laughs )
Dr. Bad,

10:49.181 --> 10:51.115
<i>you</i> are a genius.

10:51.116 --> 10:53.851
An evil genius.
( cackles )

10:54.886 --> 10:56.687
I had him blow up the school.

10:56.688 --> 10:57.688
( both gasp )

11:00.659 --> 11:02.393
When you're working
with a magic typewriter,

11:02.394 --> 11:04.328
you can never let
your characters die.

11:04.329 --> 11:05.529
Well, I didn't know
I was working

11:05.530 --> 11:06.931
with a magic typewriter.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.265
Right. Sorry.

11:08.266 --> 11:10.267
The problem is,
when your characters die,

11:10.268 --> 11:13.237
their real-life
counterparts also die.

11:13.238 --> 11:15.339
Oh. And I just spent
the last two years

11:15.340 --> 11:17.041
foolishly making friends.

11:17.042 --> 11:18.375
I suggest you
go up to your room

11:18.376 --> 11:19.543
and rewrite that ending.

11:19.544 --> 11:21.045
Don't worry.
We'll help you.

11:23.582 --> 11:26.150
How do you plan
for us to get upstairs?

11:26.151 --> 11:27.384
( typewriter clacking )

11:29.354 --> 11:30.821
There. See?

11:30.822 --> 11:32.823
Man, there are a lot
of Frisbees on the roof.

11:32.824 --> 11:34.257
SABRINA:
I've got the ending.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.759
Dr. Bad is about to
blow up the school,

11:35.760 --> 11:38.895
but then
decides not to.

11:38.896 --> 11:40.831
Oh, honey, you can't
just force the ending.

11:40.832 --> 11:43.033
It has to come from
the character's history,

11:43.034 --> 11:46.236
motivated by their
strengths and weaknesses.

11:46.237 --> 11:47.805
That's the same thing
Mr. Franco said,

11:47.806 --> 11:49.740
and I still find it annoying.

11:49.741 --> 11:51.175
You know,
but the good news is,

11:51.176 --> 11:54.378
if you find the right ending,
it practically writes itself.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.347
What is my bra
doing on the roof?

11:56.348 --> 11:57.949
Uh, the squirrels need
a nut feeder.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.684
Sabrina, we can help you
write a new ending.

12:00.685 --> 12:04.154
Try this. Um, Dr. Bad
has captured Derek

12:04.155 --> 12:06.557
and tied him
to a buzz saw.

12:06.558 --> 12:08.559
There's always been
an unpleasant edge

12:08.560 --> 12:09.760
to you, Dr. Bad.

12:09.761 --> 12:12.930
I am killing you
just to stop the puns.

12:12.931 --> 12:17.301
Suddenly, Dr. Bad
turns to Lydia and says...

12:17.302 --> 12:18.870
Turn off the saw.

12:18.871 --> 12:19.970
Why?

12:19.971 --> 12:21.338
Why? Well, the way
the courts

12:21.339 --> 12:23.441
have been cracking down
on evil geniuses lately,

12:23.442 --> 12:25.543
it just wouldn't be practical
for me to kill him.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.879
I'd end up having to pay
a legion of lawyers,

12:27.880 --> 12:30.681
which I'm sure would just wipe
out my entire retirement plan.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.283
That's a terrible
ending.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.753
Thought it was
very contemporary.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.588
You have to come up
with a believable ending,

12:37.589 --> 12:39.690
or your characters
will reject it.

12:39.691 --> 12:40.657
What am I saying?!

12:40.658 --> 12:42.426
Turn the saw
back on!

12:42.427 --> 12:43.994
( cackling )

12:48.233 --> 12:49.967
Fictional characters
can be such prima donnas.

12:49.968 --> 12:52.002
Can we get back to
the ticking bomb

12:52.003 --> 12:54.005
that's gonna vaporize all of
my friends? Not to mention

12:54.006 --> 12:56.640
the only candy machine in town
that has Nutrageous bars.

12:56.641 --> 12:58.042
Right. Try this.

12:58.043 --> 13:01.612
As the other characters
look on helplessly,

13:01.613 --> 13:03.514
Derek Kink and Dr. Bad

13:03.515 --> 13:05.650
are locked in a fight
to the death.

13:07.486 --> 13:10.087
Yes, I have found a worthy
opponent in you, Kink.

13:10.088 --> 13:12.456
Much too worthy to kill.

13:12.457 --> 13:14.524
How about
a square dance instead?

13:14.525 --> 13:15.826
Delightful.

13:15.827 --> 13:18.061
( "Turkey in the Straw"
playing )

13:21.599 --> 13:25.503
What? Ugh. That's a much
worse ending than mine.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.037
It's an unexpected
twist.

13:27.038 --> 13:29.039
Who are you people
to judge my art?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.974
No wonder I'm no good at this.
Look at my gene pool.

13:30.975 --> 13:33.577
A cat could write a better
ending than that.

13:33.578 --> 13:35.345
And will,
if you start typing.

13:35.346 --> 13:37.915
Kink had surprised
Dr. Bad...

13:37.916 --> 13:39.917
You're through,
Dr. Bad.

13:39.918 --> 13:41.552
I-- I--

13:41.553 --> 13:44.154
I would like to ask you
to square dance.
Oh.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.423
( "Turkey in the Straw"
playing )

13:47.592 --> 13:48.592
Salem.
Salem.

13:48.593 --> 13:50.928
Okay. I froze.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.062
Uh-oh.

13:52.063 --> 13:53.464
We're changing again.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.398
Oh.
Whoa.

13:54.399 --> 13:55.499
Whoa.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.600
Whoa.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.606
Had to plant rosebushes
under Sabrina's window.

14:03.775 --> 14:04.775
I figured
something out.

14:04.776 --> 14:05.776
Oh, the ending?

14:05.777 --> 14:07.311
No.

14:07.312 --> 14:09.046
I've figured out
I'm no writer, I'm a doer.

14:09.047 --> 14:10.213
So I'm gonna go
back to school

14:10.214 --> 14:12.049
and solve this
thing myself, in person.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.754
There's a little something
on your teeth, Zelly.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.123
Hey.

14:20.124 --> 14:21.725
No spots.

14:21.726 --> 14:22.860
No wings.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.328
No webbed feet.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.430
Hilda, we've beaten
the chain letter.

14:26.431 --> 14:29.933
I knew I was right to hold out
against that silly superstition.

14:29.934 --> 14:32.536
Actually, I sent out
20 letters this morning.

14:32.537 --> 14:34.771
I was not going to
apply mascara

14:34.772 --> 14:36.506
to my six new eyes.

14:36.507 --> 14:38.642
Oh, well, I have to admit

14:38.643 --> 14:41.111
it's kind of a relief
to be normal again.

14:41.112 --> 14:42.979
I liked being
taller though.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.182
I know. You can wear
anything when you're tall.

14:47.085 --> 14:48.252
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

14:48.253 --> 14:49.420
( gasps )

14:49.421 --> 14:50.921
They're loose
in the school again.

14:50.922 --> 14:53.957
I've got to somehow get them
together and disarm the bomb.

14:53.958 --> 14:55.025
Vivian!

14:57.696 --> 14:58.695
Where's Derek?

14:58.696 --> 15:00.264
Huh?

15:00.265 --> 15:02.766
Wouldn't a laptop computer
be more convenient?

15:02.767 --> 15:04.835
Still can't work
Windows 95. Got to go.

15:06.571 --> 15:08.271
if I'm her weird friend,

15:08.272 --> 15:10.807
I must be <i>really</i> weird.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.277
( <i>tense theme playing</i> )

15:13.278 --> 15:15.579
Excuse me. Even
the head cheerleader

15:15.580 --> 15:17.581
can't be in the hallway
without a pass.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.322
Okay. I am having
a h-heart attack,

15:25.323 --> 15:27.525
and I have to fill out
a form...

15:27.526 --> 15:28.759
for the hole.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.230
( scoffs )

15:33.231 --> 15:35.265
Talk about
a glamour <i>don't.</i>

15:35.266 --> 15:37.334
Cat suits went out
six years ago.

15:37.335 --> 15:38.202
( yells )

15:40.238 --> 15:41.238
( screams )

15:45.777 --> 15:48.612
I wouldn't start any
long books if I were you.

15:48.613 --> 15:49.613
( laughs )

15:49.614 --> 15:50.714
Oh, no.

15:53.551 --> 15:55.953
Uh, Dr. Bad's wheelchair

15:55.954 --> 15:58.155
started spinning
out of control like--

15:58.156 --> 15:59.456
Whoa.

15:59.457 --> 16:01.592
Like a wheelchair
spinning out of control.

16:01.593 --> 16:02.760
Run, Harvey.

16:02.761 --> 16:05.996
Oh. Why couldn't it have been
a magic legal pad?

16:07.499 --> 16:09.400
Oh. Mrs. Quick.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.968
Mrs. Quick.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.703
Have you seen
Libby Chessler?

16:12.704 --> 16:14.872
She brought some sort
of lethal laser device

16:14.873 --> 16:17.140
to school today,
and nearly killed me.

16:17.141 --> 16:18.241
Huh?

16:18.242 --> 16:19.309
( magic chimes )

16:21.346 --> 16:23.513
Harvey, have you seen
Sabrina? She's acting--

16:25.283 --> 16:27.685
Is there an afternoon prom
that nobody asked me to?

16:32.023 --> 16:33.390
Lydia.

16:33.391 --> 16:34.424
Oh.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.295
Okay, that was weird.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.331
( panting )

16:41.332 --> 16:42.299
All right.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.167
Don't start whimpering...

16:44.168 --> 16:47.170
until you get to
your office.

16:47.171 --> 16:48.638
Don't start whimpering

16:48.639 --> 16:51.142
until you get to
your office.

16:52.276 --> 16:53.410
( whimpers )

16:55.213 --> 16:56.446
Oh. Mrs. Quick.

16:56.447 --> 16:58.515
I mean, Mrs. Doohickey.
Have you seen Derek?

16:58.516 --> 16:59.750
Who wants to know?

16:59.751 --> 17:02.086
Uh, will you hold
this a second?

17:02.087 --> 17:05.021
Uh, a mysterious blonde spy
asks Mrs. Doohickey

17:05.021 --> 17:06.923
for help in
locating Derek Kink.

17:06.924 --> 17:08.759
Mrs. Doohickey
leads her to him.

17:08.760 --> 17:09.727
Follow me.

17:09.728 --> 17:10.660
Ooh.

17:11.796 --> 17:13.262
Next time, write
that Mrs. Doohickey

17:13.263 --> 17:14.897
carries the typewriter.

17:14.898 --> 17:16.700
( whimper, shrieks )

17:16.701 --> 17:18.068
Don't hurt me.
Oh, God.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.670
Mr. Kraft.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.805
Why are you acting
like a freshman?

17:21.806 --> 17:23.507
Because--

17:23.508 --> 17:24.575
You're not armed?

17:24.576 --> 17:25.542
( clears throat )

17:25.544 --> 17:27.010
In that case,
Miss Chessler,

17:27.011 --> 17:28.212
you are suspended.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.413
What?
Yes.

17:29.414 --> 17:32.316
It's Valerie who needs
to be suspended. She kicked me.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.517
Well, that--

17:33.518 --> 17:36.787
That would explain
<i>your</i> strange behavior.

17:36.788 --> 17:38.722
Miss Birkhead fries.
Come on.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.629
( gasps )
Oh, dear.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.331
Uh, substitute
teacher.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.665
I don't think she looks
like you at all.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.268
The psychic was right.

17:51.269 --> 17:53.703
I <i>was</i> separated at birth.

17:53.704 --> 17:55.171
Oh.

17:55.172 --> 17:56.206
Ah-yah!

17:56.207 --> 17:57.207
Keep her away
from me.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.042
She has poison
chalk dust.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.644
I don't even
have gum.

18:00.645 --> 18:02.813
What is going on
at this school today?

18:02.814 --> 18:04.080
Oh, it's a pretty
normal day, Libby.

18:04.081 --> 18:06.350
Although, I did learn
I have an exact duplicate.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.184
She just ran down the hall
with Sabrina.

18:08.185 --> 18:09.386
You know...every time

18:09.387 --> 18:11.221
anything strange happens
around this school,

18:11.222 --> 18:13.991
the trail always
leads to Sabrina.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.560
Or to janitor Bob.
But we know that Sabrina

18:16.561 --> 18:18.729
is still in
the country. Hm.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.564
Come on.

18:20.565 --> 18:23.466
( <i>suspenseful theme playing</i> )

18:23.467 --> 18:25.668
Derek. Dr. Bad
has planted a bomb.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.304
An explosive
situation.

18:27.305 --> 18:28.538
I know where it is.
Come with me.

18:28.539 --> 18:29.539
Dynamite idea.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.375
And you can cool it
with the puns.

18:31.376 --> 18:34.011
Look, what happened
between us was wrong.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.213
Sabrina's my best friend,
and you're her boyfriend, and--

18:36.214 --> 18:37.681
When did you change
your clothes?

18:37.682 --> 18:39.048
Couple days ago?

18:39.049 --> 18:40.017
Miss Birkhead...

18:40.018 --> 18:42.018
I am suspending you
for attacking Libby.

18:42.019 --> 18:43.920
What?
When did you
change your clothes?

18:43.921 --> 18:45.723
Mr. Kraft, what did you
do with your wheelchair?

18:45.724 --> 18:47.591
What?
Oh, look.

18:47.592 --> 18:48.626
There's Sabrina.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.927
Who's that
with her?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.228
Someone who
looks like...

18:51.229 --> 18:52.128
Harvey?

18:52.129 --> 18:53.096
LIBBY:
And you?

18:53.097 --> 18:54.231
MRS. QUICK:
And me.

18:54.232 --> 18:55.432
Hi!

18:57.768 --> 18:59.470
I could've been
pulling down 80 grand a year

18:59.471 --> 19:00.637
selling gold
over the phone.

19:00.638 --> 19:03.173
But no, I had to <i>teach.</i>

19:03.174 --> 19:04.841
Okay.

19:04.842 --> 19:05.842
Turn it off.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.043
Delighted.

19:07.044 --> 19:09.112
What's the procedure here,
Mrs. Doohickey?

19:09.113 --> 19:10.614
I only make things
blow up.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.582
I don't know how to
stop them from blowing up.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.685
I don't know
which wire to cut.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.554
Oh, no. My characters
don't know what to do.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.455
That's because they don't
know why they're doing

19:18.456 --> 19:20.524
what they're doing.
Darn character development.

19:20.525 --> 19:22.726
Um,...okay.

19:22.727 --> 19:25.029
Derek Kink's father wanted him
to go into the family business:

19:25.030 --> 19:26.029
corn.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.331
But Kink loved science.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.598
Against his family's wishes,

19:28.599 --> 19:32.269
he joined the Bomb Disposal
Unit of the FBI.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.437
Does anyone have a pair

19:33.438 --> 19:36.539
of 178-millimeter
insulated wire cutters?

19:38.276 --> 19:39.310
( sighs )

19:41.146 --> 19:42.513
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

19:42.514 --> 19:43.480
( blows )

19:43.481 --> 19:46.817
I believe you are all
my prisoners.

19:46.818 --> 19:49.253
You don't understand.
There's only a few seconds left.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.787
If-- If Derek doesn't
disarm the bomb,

19:50.788 --> 19:52.189
we're all gonna die.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.925
Then we will all
die together.

19:54.926 --> 19:56.226
( cackling )

20:04.436 --> 20:06.603
Sabrina Spellman,
This is Mr. Kraft.

20:06.604 --> 20:08.639
Come out with your hands
behind your head.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.273
DR. BAD:
Don't move.

20:12.009 --> 20:12.909
Well, come on, Kinkle.

20:12.910 --> 20:14.444
A separated shoulder
won't hurt you.

20:14.445 --> 20:15.545
( groans )

20:17.015 --> 20:17.947
DR. BAD:
Hey!

20:21.652 --> 20:23.153
SABRINA:
The wire. The wire.

20:24.321 --> 20:25.822
KINK:
I've got it.

20:25.823 --> 20:28.125
This is all going on your
permanent record, young lady.

20:28.126 --> 20:29.159
The end.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.629
( both grunt )

20:32.630 --> 20:34.565
Three weeks detention,

20:34.566 --> 20:36.666
starting
this afternoon.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.936
( <i>poppy theme playing</i> )

20:38.937 --> 20:40.370
( grits teeth ):
Another happy ending.

20:44.542 --> 20:45.876
So I saved the school
from blowing up,

20:45.877 --> 20:47.544
and I rewrote
my story in detention.

20:47.545 --> 20:48.846
Teacher gave me
a B-minus.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.948
It's not an A,
but it's not a C either.

20:50.949 --> 20:52.916
I always feel the minus
part is personal.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.184
I'm just glad
you realized that

20:54.185 --> 20:55.885
because you're not
great at something

20:55.886 --> 20:58.722
doesn't mean you can't learn
from it and have fun with it.

20:58.723 --> 21:00.290
That's what I always
say about dating.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.726
But I never learn anything,
and I don't have fun.

21:02.727 --> 21:03.860
Wait a minute.

21:03.861 --> 21:06.029
So you're saying
I'm not a great writer?

21:06.030 --> 21:07.363
Well...

21:07.364 --> 21:08.999
you see...
( toaster dings )

21:09.000 --> 21:11.367
Oh, my.
There's toast.

21:11.368 --> 21:13.503
Oh, it's from the
Other Realm postmaster.

21:15.205 --> 21:17.808
He says they caught the person
who started that chain letter,

21:17.809 --> 21:19.743
and he's been
dealt with accordingly.

21:19.744 --> 21:22.680
Good. What kind of a foul
fiend would abuse the mails?

21:22.681 --> 21:25.415
I was just
reaching out to people.

21:25.416 --> 21:27.351
Oh, dear. The postmaster
also says that

21:27.352 --> 21:28.985
because we sent chain
letters ourselves,

21:28.986 --> 21:30.987
we have to be
punished too.

21:30.988 --> 21:31.922
But--

21:33.058 --> 21:35.025
I loved you
in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

21:35.026 --> 21:36.326
Fly. Fly.
