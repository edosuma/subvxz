19:16.956 --> 19:18.690
[Loud bang]

19:18.690 --> 19:24.181
I did say usually.

19:24.181 --> 19:29.130
I'm sure your family has had to deal with stuff like this before?

19:29.130 --> 19:32.936
I wouldn't know I haven't met that side of my family.

19:32.936 --> 19:36.130
Oh, are you adopted?

19:36.130 --> 19:38.600
No, I was raised by my uncle.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.166
My mother and father died when I was younger.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.920
So you've never met them.

19:44.920 --> 19:52.685
My uncle was gonna tell me who they were after the wedding but...

19:53.881 --> 19:57.546
You know.

19:57.546 --> 19:59.281
Yeah.

19:59.281 --> 20:04.251
Well, thanks for everything.

20:07.182 --> 20:13.750
hey, uhm, for what's it worth...

20:13.750 --> 20:18.819
I would've never done what she did to you.

20:18.819 --> 20:21.183
Cheating on you and leaving. I think she's crazy.

20:22.678 --> 20:29.144
I, uhm, I appreciate that. But I think I need some alone time.

20:29.144 --> 20:38.093
Right. Understandable. Well, if you ever need to talk or anything-

20:38.093 --> 20:40.552
Don't be a stranger.

20:40.552 --> 20:44.898

21:13.558 --> 21:15.040
Yo man, whats up?

21:15.040 --> 21:17.635
I think Aly is hiding at Melanie's house.

21:17.635 --> 21:19.404
Wait, what? Why?

21:19.404 --> 21:24.420
Melanie told me that Aly met someone else at her bachelorette party and then ran away-

21:24.420 --> 21:29.485
Without telling anyone but that doesn't sound right. So you think she's still there hiding?

21:29.485 --> 21:31.960
Something happened between Melanie and Aly

21:31.960 --> 21:37.978
And Melanie being a good friend is trying to hide it for her.

21:37.978 --> 21:41.114
This is crazy. Do you need me to come by?

21:41.114 --> 21:43.199
No, no, I've got another idea.

21:43.199 --> 21:47.317
When it gets late at night I'm going to sneak into Melanie's house-

21:47.317 --> 21:49.528
And find out what's really going on.

21:49.528 --> 21:51.497
So you're going to break into somebodies house...

21:51.497 --> 21:53.330
I need to do this so I can find...

21:56.687 --> 22:00.202

Wedding, what?

31:44.787 --> 31:47.472
Why are you wearing Aly's ring?

32:09.687 --> 32:12.563
What the hell are you doing?

32:12.563 --> 32:18.288
I'm having dinner with my future husband. I thought that much was clear.

32:18.288 --> 32:21.705
I'm already a husband and I have a wife! Where is she?!

32:23.619 --> 32:29.030
Shhhh...Be quiet! You're going to wake my mom!

32:29.030 --> 32:31.895
-Really your mom? -Yes, my mom.

32:31.895 --> 32:36.167
How do I know that's true? How do I know that's not Aly up there?

And then you make food and you wanna play house? Why are you doing this?

34:27.757 --> 34:31.868
I've been observing people my entire life.

34:31.868 --> 34:35.200
and the love that most people have for each other is finite.
