(♪ MOONLIGHT SERENADE)

01:52.904 --> 01:55.364
Hello, Mr Kranz.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.618
- I'd like to redeem my...
- I know! The trombone.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.078
I always keep her
hanging in the window

02:01.079 --> 02:04.582
so when you walk by you can
see she is still there.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.250
I keep my eyes on her.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.669
Say, Mr Miller, where'd you
got the money this time?

02:09.670 --> 02:14.175
- Working in a gas station.
- And now you've got another band job?

02:14.176 --> 02:18.971
Yep. I'm with Minton at the Sunset
Hotel. Chummy's gonna pick me up.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.642
Your friend Chummy, why
don't he hock something?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.019
- He plays the piano.
- I see!

02:25.020 --> 02:30.441
That's all we need! To schlep a piano
in and out every once in a while.

02:30.442 --> 02:34.028
That string of pearls, how
much did you say that was?

02:34.029 --> 02:36.530
I'd like to give my girl
a birthday present.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.616
Isn't it wonderful to be young?

02:38.617 --> 02:43.954
He just got his trombone out of hock
and he wants to buy a $100 necklace.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.790
$100?

02:45.791 --> 02:48.959
I'd like to give her this. Haven't
seen her for a few years.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.921
- You are engaged?
- No, not exactly.

02:51.922 --> 02:56.384
We went around together when we were
in college. University of Colorado.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.428
$100. That's a lot
of money, isn't it?

02:59.429 --> 03:02.682
For a regular customer,
I make a special price.

03:02.683 --> 03:06.012
- (CAR HORN)
- I guess that's Chummy.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.897
A hundred dollars.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.484
Here's for the horn.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.780
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

03:20.492 --> 03:24.745
- Where'd you get this one, Chummy?
- Made a deal on my Briscoe.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.249
She's a beaut. 45 horsepower.
Only four years old.

03:28.250 --> 03:32.171
- 45 horse...
- Come on, hop in. We gotta get goin'.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.215
- Isn't this a darb, kid?
- Yeah, gee whiz!

03:36.216 --> 03:39.427
- You bring my arrangement?
- You're sittin' on it.

03:39.428 --> 03:43.347
But this is the Sunset Hotel,
potted palms and marble stairs.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.267
- Minton's band plays sweet.
- I know that.

03:46.268 --> 03:50.062
Don't try to slip in that
arrangement of yours tonight.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.066
- We don't wanna lose this job.
- Stop worryin'. This is a classic.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.528
I Dreamt I Dwelt In Marble
Halls, it's a classic!

03:57.529 --> 04:02.951
When Minton hears this arrangement,
he'll give us a job for life. Let's go.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.045
(♪ UPBEAT SWING)

04:32.939 --> 04:35.358
(♪ ROMANTIC SWING)

04:51.416 --> 04:55.837
Too bad you can't keep the
trombone and hock the arrangement.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.223
- You know where there's Venice?
- Italy.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.810
No! Venice here. By the
pier, with that big wheel.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.271
- Oh, yeah.
- You boys go out there next Monday.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.858
- This fellow Pollack, he has tryouts.
- Ben Pollack?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.529
Ben Pollack. He gets
together a new band.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.781
They go for a long, long trip.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.909
- How do you know?
- A fellow told me this morning.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.787
- You boys go out there.
- Sure. Thanks a lot.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.247
Next Monday?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.833
That gives you a week to
get your trombone out.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.836
- You could work in a gas station.
- Not me.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.004
I'm gonna work on arrangements.

05:39.005 --> 05:43.133
For me, I'm glad for your
business, Mr Miller,

05:43.134 --> 05:47.638
but why don't you give up this
arranging and stick with the trombone?

05:47.639 --> 05:50.850
That's a good question.
I wish I knew the answer.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.812
But I have one idea
up here in my head.

05:54.813 --> 05:58.399
To me, music is more than
just one instrument.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.277
It's a whole orchestra
playing together. See?

06:01.278 --> 06:05.281
The only way I can express myself
is to work out an arrangement.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.158
See? Thanks for the tip.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.494
Come on.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.039
(♪ RAGTIME PIANO)

07:03.798 --> 07:05.883
Great!

07:05.884 --> 07:09.303
- Thanks, Ben.
- You're in. You're in.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.598
- Who's next?
- I am.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.683
I've done some arrangements...

07:14.684 --> 07:17.561
I'm full up on arrangements.
I need more musicians.

07:17.562 --> 07:21.315
I've been working on 'em all week.
They're in your style.

07:21.316 --> 07:25.277
I appreciate that. Lay them on the
piano, I'll try 'em some other time.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.401
Uh-huh.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.742
- My name's on the cover.
- Swell.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.494
OK, who's next?

07:33.495 --> 07:36.789
I am. My name's Schwartz.
Wilbur Schwartz.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.584
Clarinet, eh? Sit down at the first
chair and blow a little bit.

07:40.585 --> 07:45.339
- What tune do you want me to play?
- Do you read at sight?

07:45.340 --> 07:48.794
- Try me.
- Chummy, get him something to read.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.403
One, two.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.698
(♪ PLAYS UPBEAT TUNE)

08:40.145 --> 08:42.438
(MUSIC STOPS)

08:53.658 --> 08:57.828
Hey, Glenn! Come on back.
Mr Pollack wants to talk to you.

08:57.829 --> 09:02.079
He says your arrangement
is a pip! Your arrangement!

09:03.209 --> 09:06.086
I'm playing in the band and
working on arrangements.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.838
I got a two-week advance.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.965
You are a regular Rockefeller!

09:09.966 --> 09:14.595
- I want to thank you for everything.
- Don't mention about it.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.639
I'm only glad it
worked so good out.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.934
About that string of pearls
for my girl's birthday.

09:20.935 --> 09:25.314
You said something about a
special price for those.

09:25.315 --> 09:30.235
For you it's $80. You pay
me 40 down and $5 a week.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.654
- Good enough.
- Shall I mail it for you?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.783
I better take 'em with me.
I'm not sure of her address.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.203
We're booked into Denver.
She lives right near there.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.414
Ten, 20, 30, 40. There's the 40.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.794
- And here is for the trombone.
- All right.

09:46.795 --> 09:50.380
- Thank you very much.
- Same to you, and good luck.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.425
I hope you stay out of
pawnshops for a while.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.971
- So do I! Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr Miller.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.023
- Glenn, come on!
- A Pierce-Arrow?

10:08.024 --> 10:11.068
Yeah! I got it for the
old car and 100 bucks.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.196
Much heavier. It'll hold the
road better on a long trip.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.407
If the band folds up, we can
sell it to an undertaker.

10:17.408 --> 10:20.612
Get in the back, I'll
give you a ride in style.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.851
Hurry, Glenn. We're due at the
Denver Palace in ten minutes.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.896
- How much, sir?
- Oh, give us five.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.704
Hello. I want Boulder 6-1-7-0.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.958
How many?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.216
(TELEPHONE)

11:15.925 --> 11:18.127
I'll get it, Mother.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.515
Hello?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.845
Hello? Helen? How's my girl?

11:27.478 --> 11:29.563
Your girl? Who is this?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.024
Who is this? Is this Helen Burger?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.734
Yes, but there must be some...

11:33.735 --> 11:38.065
- Well, it's Glenn!
- Glenn? Glenn who?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.699
It's Glenn Miller!

11:40.700 --> 11:43.202
Glenn Miller?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.662
Oh, Glenn Miller.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.458
Well, now, honestly. After
two years and not a word.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.210
Didn't you get my card?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.503
The one you wrote a year
ago last Christmas?

11:53.504 --> 11:56.089
Well, I haven't heard
from you either.

11:56.090 --> 12:00.594
I didn't know where you were.
I don't even know where you are now.

12:00.595 --> 12:05.015
I'm down here in Denver. I want
to see you. How about tonight?

12:05.016 --> 12:07.309
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a date.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.021
Couldn't you break it? I'm with
Pollack and we're leavin' tomorrow.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.940
Now, honestly, I...

12:12.941 --> 12:15.859
(CHUMMY)
Glenn, come on, hurry it up.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.196
I'll see you later, then. Gee,
there's a lot I want to tell you.

12:19.197 --> 12:24.153
- Glenn, wait a minute...
- I'll be out right after I finish work. Bye.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.372
Glenn? Hello?

12:30.375 --> 12:32.748
Well, honestly.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.636
- Hi, Dad.
- Going out, Helen?

12:42.637 --> 12:45.681
This is a new wrinkle, isn't it?
Ed keeping you waiting.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.850
It isn't Ed tonight. It's a
man I haven't seen for years.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.019
Not Ed? What's happened?

12:51.020 --> 12:53.647
It must be serious for you
to break a date with Ed.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.566
No, Mother. Glenn isn't my type.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.904
I guess I'm just too practical
or unromantic or something.

13:00.905 --> 13:07.286
I want a man like Ed who's got a
factory or a store or something solid.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.747
I certainly don't want a wandering
nomad like Glenn Miller.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.451
What's he do, this Glenn Miller?

13:13.876 --> 13:17.754
I don't really know except he said
he was in Denver for overnight.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.965
He's gonna pick me up after work.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.720
He must be a hard worker.
It's nearly 9:00 now.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.514
It is?

13:27.515 --> 13:29.809
Well.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.275
(CLOCK STRIKES)

13:38.276 --> 13:41.528
Oh! There's really
no excuse for this!

13:41.529 --> 13:43.655
The least he could've
done was phone.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.366
- Unless he was in an accident.
- Call him.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.493
How can I? I don't
know where he is.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.621
If I'm going hunting in the
morning, I've gotta get to bed.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.333
Sam's picking me up
at the crack of dawn.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.086
- Doesn't look as if he's coming tonight.
- It certainly doesn't!

13:58.087 --> 14:00.380
Even if he did come,
I wouldn't see him.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.716
Then we can all go to bed?

14:02.717 --> 14:06.678
Well, so much for Mr Glenn Miller.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.973
I'll never see him again.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.823
(GLENN, CALLING SOFTLY) Helen?

(WHISTLES)

14:33.498 --> 14:35.041
Helen?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.714
Helen!

(WHISTLES)

14:45.426 --> 14:48.470
Helen! (WHISTLES)

14:52.016 --> 14:55.140
- Oh, there you are.
- Glenn Miller, you go away.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.231
I don't want to go away. I came
to see you. We have a date.

14:59.232 --> 15:04.484
- Shh! You'll wake up the neighbourhood.
- How can I talk to you?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.282
You keep quiet. I'll be right down.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.346
Hello, Helen.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.099
What's the matter with
you, coming at this hour?

15:34.100 --> 15:38.103
I told you I'd come out after work.
I got here as quick as I could.

15:38.104 --> 15:42.274
- Shh. Be quiet.
- You haven't changed a bit, have you?

15:42.275 --> 15:46.069
Just as feisty as ever,
and just as pretty too.

15:46.070 --> 15:50.615
I must be pretty! Wearing this
kimono and my hair up in curlers.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.993
Is that what they are?
Come on, sit down.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.621
- It's cold out here.
- Come on. It's a beautiful night.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.998
Gee.

15:57.999 --> 16:02.586
There. I bought you a
present for your birthday.

16:02.587 --> 16:06.465
My birthday? That isn't
until next November.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.760
This is for your last birthday.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.432
Why, they're beautiful! But I
can't accept a present like this.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.894
Why not? They're not real.
I wish they were.

16:18.895 --> 16:23.273
I got 'em out in Los Angeles in
a pa... In a, uh... A, uh...

16:23.274 --> 16:25.977
I'll get you some
real ones someday.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.403
Honestly.

16:28.404 --> 16:32.324
Two years and not a word and
then a present like this.

16:32.325 --> 16:37.204
You know, with some people you don't
have to write. You just know.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.499
- I knew you'd be here.
- Oh, you did?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.877
Sure. I knew you'd
be just the same.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.047
Just sitting around waiting for
you to show up, I suppose?

16:47.048 --> 16:50.884
"How is my girl?" you said.
Well, you happen to be wrong!

16:50.885 --> 16:54.012
I've been engaged to Ed
Healey for nearly a year.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.557
Did it occur to you that I might
not care if I ever saw you again?

16:57.558 --> 16:59.726
No, it never did.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.770
Never.

17:01.771 --> 17:05.022
- Never.
- Why can't I ever stay mad at you?

17:05.023 --> 17:07.858
You had me worried
there for a minute.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.237
Honestly!

17:10.238 --> 17:15.075
If you were anybody else,
I would never speak to you again.

17:15.076 --> 17:19.663
Look at me. Sitting here in
this kimono and my hair all...

17:19.664 --> 17:22.583
- Those curlers.
- Terrible, isn't it?

17:23.834 --> 17:27.671
Helen, now look, I've got an idea.

17:27.672 --> 17:31.752
Come with me to Fort Morgan.
I'm gonna introduce you to my folks.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.344
- Now?
- Right now.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.972
People do sleep
between 3am and 6am.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.474
They'll be crazy about you.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.602
- And they'll give us breakfast.
- How do we get there?

17:42.603 --> 17:45.188
- I'll get a taxi.
- A taxi to Fort Morgan?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.566
- Sure.
- That's so extravagant.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.277
- It isn't far.
- Maybe I can get the family car.

Glad to see you. Hello, Irene.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.112
- What a surprise! I had no idea.
- Hello, Mother.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.239
Glad to see you. Mother, this is...

You don't need to tell me.
You're Helen!

18:41.662 --> 18:44.080
Why, yes. I'm very
happy to meet you.

- Daddy'll be down in a minute.
- Dean and Velna?

18:47.251 --> 18:50.086
They're fine! I'll show you
a picture of the baby.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.089
- Sure.
- She your girl, Glenn?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.841
That's right, Herb.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.135
Are you and Glenn
gonna get married?

18:57.136 --> 19:00.513
Don't ask that! We just take
such things for granted.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.682
- How are you, son?
- Fine.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.894
- And you're Helen. Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.981
- You gonna get these kids some breakfast?
- I certainly am!

19:09.982 --> 19:13.943
You might've let us know where
you are and what your plans are.

19:13.944 --> 19:17.072
We have to ask Helen, eh?
I'll bet he tells you everything.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.492
Oh, no, Mr Miller. I seem to
be the last person he tells.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.286
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.844
the way you score each one of
the individual instruments.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.847
Some bands have that sound
already, like Pollack,

21:47.848 --> 21:50.600
but it's not the right
sound, not for me.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.645
- What is?
- I don't know.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.397

53:21.115 --> 53:24.409
We can't lose that week in Boston.
Go ahead. Bye, dear.

53:24.410 --> 53:26.578
- Take care.
- Yeah.

53:41.135 --> 53:43.386
- You Mr Miller?
- Yeah.

53:43.387 --> 53:47.682
Man left a message. Your wife's sick.
They got her to the hospital.

53:47.683 --> 53:50.386
- What hospital?
- Boston Memorial.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.816
Mr Miller, she's a very sick girl.

53:56.817 --> 54:00.570
We gave her a transfusion but we're
lucky this happened when it did.

54:00.571 --> 54:04.782
A few months further along and we might've
lost the mother as well as the child.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.951
I had no idea that she was...

54:06.952 --> 54:09.120
- All right, Doctor.
- Thank you.

54:09.121 --> 54:11.415
Just for a minute.

54:26.597 --> 54:28.970
Helen.

54:33.228 --> 54:35.522
The truck all right?

54:41.862 --> 54:45.865
Five and a quarter, cash on the barrel
head. Take it or leave it, boys.

54:45.866 --> 54:47.992
Better than the others.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.328
I guess we'll have to take it.

54:50.329 --> 54:54.290
Kinda leaves us in a spot. It's
$900 to pay the boys in the band.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.417
With my car? How
much'll you give us?

54:56.418 --> 54:59.545
- You're not gonna do it.
- I can sell my own car if I want to.

54:59.546 --> 55:03.800
Four hundred. That makes nine and
a quarter for all three of 'em.

55:03.801 --> 55:08.012
- This isn't your problem.
- Why isn't it? I wanna get paid off, too.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.306
You got a deal. Just one condition.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.476
I need the car long enough to
drive the boys to the station.

55:13.477 --> 55:15.144
Yes, that can be arranged.

55:15.145 --> 55:18.231
Fellas, pile in. I'll
drive you to the station.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.526
Thank you, Chummy.

55:25.072 --> 55:28.074
- Hi, dear. How do you feel?
- Fine.

55:28.075 --> 55:30.618
- You look much better.
- Good.

55:30.619 --> 55:33.788
The doctor said if I behave
myself, I'll be up in a few days.

55:33.789 --> 55:35.665
Good.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.709
I've made up my mind about
something, young lady.

55:38.710 --> 55:41.712
If I ever go on the road again,

55:41.713 --> 55:46.217
you're gonna stay in that nice
apartment of ours on East 57th Street.

55:46.218 --> 55:48.386
You just listen to
me, Glenn Miller.

55:48.387 --> 55:51.556
You enticed a little country
girl to run away and marry you

55:51.557 --> 55:53.307
and now you're hooked with her.

55:53.308 --> 55:57.311
And I'm not gonna let you go gallivanting
around the country without me.

55:57.312 --> 56:00.648
You're hooked with a no-good
itinerant musician.

56:00.649 --> 56:04.777
- I'm not complaining.
- I know. You never do.

56:04.778 --> 56:08.656
But I know how you wanted kids.

56:08.657 --> 56:11.951
I want to tell you something else
I've made up my mind about.

56:11.952 --> 56:15.162
We're not gonna have just one
child. We're gonna have two!

56:15.163 --> 56:17.290
We're gonna have a boy and a girl.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.125
- Glenn, I can't.
- I know.

56:19.126 --> 56:21.544
The doctor told me, but I mean it.

56:21.545 --> 56:26.797
There'll be two kids meant for us.
Somewhere we're gonna find them.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.763
I hope so.

56:35.934 --> 56:38.102
Who sent these flowers?

56:38.103 --> 56:40.438
- The boys in the band.
- Wasn't that nice?

56:40.439 --> 56:42.641
They're sweet.

56:44.401 --> 56:46.603
What's happened? Any dates?

56:47.738 --> 56:50.282
No. No dates.

56:51.491 --> 56:53.534
There's no band.

56:53.535 --> 56:56.203
We had to sell the cars
and pay off the boys.

56:56.204 --> 57:00.207
Chummy had to sell his Phaeton.
Isn't that a shame?

57:00.208 --> 57:03.082
Poor Chummy really loved that car.

57:06.006 --> 57:09.258
Glenn, you had a good band.

57:09.259 --> 57:12.637
It was getting better all the
time. It wasn't your fault.

57:12.638 --> 57:15.014
It's my fault all right!

57:15.015 --> 57:17.975
I'm broke, I'm in debt,
I don't even have a job.

57:17.976 --> 57:23.022
I told you before, you've gotten mixed
up with a no-good itinerant musician.

57:23.023 --> 57:26.898
- And I love him.
- And I love you.

57:30.614 --> 57:32.657
It's almost worth it.

57:32.658 --> 57:37.580
It's the first time you've told me
that since the day we were married.

57:50.759 --> 57:53.087
Come in.

57:54.388 --> 57:57.181
- Mrs Miller?
- Yes.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.850
I thought so. I can come in?

57:59.851 --> 58:02.053
Well, yes, of course.

58:04.398 --> 58:06.857
I brought you some flowers.

58:06.858 --> 58:10.153
Oh. Well, thank you very much.

58:14.157 --> 58:17.159
- They're all right?
- They're lovely.

58:17.160 --> 58:21.205
I'm a bachelor, I got no wife
to tell me these things.

58:21.206 --> 58:24.166
- Well, they're very pretty.
- Yeah.

58:24.167 --> 58:27.336
I heard all about the band
and how you were sick.

58:27.337 --> 58:30.632
Such a shame. I can
sit down a minute?

58:31.091 --> 58:33.134
Yes, please.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.797
"Compliments of the
State Ballroom."

58:37.764 --> 58:41.684
- Is this a joke?
- I shoulda said so right away.

58:41.685 --> 58:44.270
No, that's me. Si Schribman.

58:44.271 --> 58:47.106
Si Schribman! If I'd
known who you were...

58:47.107 --> 58:50.818
I know. Don Haynes said you wanted
to give me a piece of your mind.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.862
That's why I came here.

58:52.863 --> 58:55.612
Maybe we can exchange
pieces of mind.

58:56.616 --> 59:00.995
I'm not really such an ogre.
I didn't like cancelling you out.

59:00.996 --> 59:04.874
But an old widow lady, 75,
she owns that ballroom.

59:04.875 --> 59:07.251
If I don't have a band,
I don't pay the rent.

59:07.252 --> 59:10.838
If I don't pay the rent,
that old lady don't eat.

59:10.839 --> 59:13.133
It's a bad situation.

59:13.884 --> 59:18.596
If she would only die, God forbid,
then I could run it like I like.

59:18.597 --> 59:21.474
- It finished us. You know that.
- Yeah.

59:21.475 --> 59:24.268
- We had to break up the band.
- I know.

59:24.269 --> 59:26.729
I heard the band. It was good.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.648
Not great, mind you,
but good, very good.

59:29.649 --> 59:35.029
We were just getting started. Well,
now I don't know what we'll do.

59:35.030 --> 59:40.282
Just don't you worry, young lady. Get
well, and don't worry about the band.

59:40.994 --> 59:42.828
That's easy to say.

59:42.829 --> 59:45.790
I believe in Glenn and I believe
what he's trying to do,

59:45.791 --> 59:47.993
so naturally I worry.

59:48.627 --> 59:52.046
I tell you, you send him
over, he should see me.

59:52.047 --> 59:54.799
With my own money that
don't go to the widow,

59:54.800 --> 59:58.469
- I sometimes invest in bands.
- Do you mean that?

59:58.470 --> 01:00:02.015
Would I make myself so
much trouble if I didn't?

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:05.893
But there's a problem.
I know Glenn.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.896
He's down right now and
he won't accept help.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:11.899
I don't think he'd risk
somebody else's money.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.735
I never even met your husband
and I like him already.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.780
You just leave it to me.
I'll cook up something.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.157
Thank you very much for coming.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.451
And I'm sorry I was so ungracious.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:27.456
Who was ungracious? We got along
fine exchanging pieces of mind.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.830
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:38.425
I know you don't want
a band but I'm stuck.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.596
But this Charley Firman sneaks a
band right out from under my nose.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:47.101
- I don't have any men. No money.
- I'll give you the money. Here.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:51.188
Five hundred. Six hundred.
A thousand.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:54.358
There. You got the money.
Now, go get the men.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:59.738
I've tried all sorts of combinations.
I never found out what I was looking for.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:04.201
If I start again, I've got to have an
entirely different kind of a band.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:07.204
Different tunes. I wanna
try something radical.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:10.666
Fine. Go get radical,
but just get going!

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:15.373
I gotta have something in here making
a noise the kids can dance to.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:20.923
OK.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:28.517
- Let's have the five saxes right in there.
- Five saxes?

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.103
And the trombones over there.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.814
And the four trumpets
right behind them.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.066
Four trombones and four trumpets!

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:38.819
When they play, what's
gonna hold the roof on?

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.071
Five saxes and a trumpet lead.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:44.116
Maybe it's good and maybe
it ain't, but it's radical.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.576
Let's try this.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:49.371
Remember this is a ballad, so take
it nice and easy, don't bruise it.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:53.500
Joe, you stand up so I can get a balance
between you and the saxophones.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.252
All right, here we go.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.879
One,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.589
two.

What's the matter?

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.131
- He cut his lip.
- Let's see.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.718
Oh, no. You really split it open.
You better have it looked at.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:29.263
- I'm sorry, Glenn.
- Go on, Joe. Take care of it.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.466
Oh, no.

All right, take five, boys.

- Is it bad?
- He'll be out for weeks.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.825
- You get more tough breaks...
- Just when you got a good sound.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.912
It isn't what I want but if
we could've worked on it...

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:58.042
- You can't find another trumpet blower?
- Not with Joe's range.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.711
All the arrangements
have a trumpet lead?

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.672
He had to hurt his lip
the day before you open.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.175
What are we gonna do?
Postpone the opening?

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.845
- Poor old widow lady.
- We're not gonna postpone anything.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:14.058
We'll open tomorrow if I have to stay up
all night and rewrite the arrangement.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:17.644
- You can't. It's impossible.
- Wait a minute!

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.022
Just a minute. I have an idea.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:24.485
Willie Schwartz could play those
parts on clarinet. Why not?

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.612
You see? Clarinet lead. Why not?

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:29.698
Get me lots of manuscript paper.
Can I use your office?

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.450
Sure.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:35.412
Clarinet lead. Why not? And, Don,
call Helen, tell her not to worry.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:38.415
Tell her I'll be here all night.
Clarinet lead.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:42.496
And I can harmonise it real
tight, all in the same octave.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.043
Four saxes and a clarinet.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.839

My birthday? That isn't

You rested up ready

We've had a wonderful
time with little Stevie.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.372
- Quite a boy. Big for his age.
- Isn't he?

I can't tell you how much
it's meant to us to have him.

- Yes, dear.

- Oh, yes.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:09.676
- Where'd she go?
- I suppose she's shopping.

wedding anniversary every day!

- Oh, no.

- Oh, yes.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:47.506
Then there's the records. And he's
playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:14.074
How much do they pay for playing
on one of those records?

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.369
- We get three cents a record.
- Three cents?

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.871
Have to sell a heap of records
to make it worthwhile.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.581
But they do, dear!

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:24.668
- Let's go see Stevie.
- No, Helen wants us to wait.

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:28.004
Why? Come on. Sure, we
can go on up there.

- Hi. Stevie and I have a surprise for you.
- You do?

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:35.012
- Let's go up to the nursery.
- Come on.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.140
How many copies of a
record do they sell, son?

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:43.062
Moonlight Serenade, we
sold about 800,000 copies.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.059
- Did you say 800,000?
- That's right.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.738
What's...

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.158
Look what just arrived.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.205
This is Stevie's new baby sister.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:06.167
- Can I pick her up?
- I think so. She's your daughter.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:10.339
Well, well, well.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:15.844
So you're Jonnie Dee! Look,
she's beautiful! Isn't she?

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.096
Look at those red cheeks.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:21.808
Stevie, look at your baby sister.
Isn't she beautiful?

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:25.603
- You sure surprised him!
- I've been planning it for months.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:29.691
- I told 'em I just had to have her today.
- How old is she?

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:32.444
- Six weeks today.
- Old lady.

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:37.657
- She's a hungry old woman.
- This is gonna take some expert action.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:41.362
Her young father's gonna feed her.
Let's have the bottle.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.913
Here, now. Here we go.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.541
All right, Jonnie Dee.
There we are.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.835
How's your appetite?

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:51.296
There! Is this hot enough?

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:55.502
That's a good girl.
The kid's starved.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:06.311
- Helen, we'll be late for the theatre.
- Coming.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:09.355
- I'll get the car.
- All right, dear.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:15.153
Glenn, I've been figuring. 800,000 records
at three cents apiece, that's $24,000.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:17.989
- That's right.
- Just for one record?

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:21.284
Well, you certainly are
doing well at that!

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:25.331
All right, boys, right over here.
You all set? All right.

The band has a number, and that's
exactly what it is, a number.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.467
This is based on a telephone number

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:23.638

I've known it for months. I knew
it was only a question of time.

01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:23.302
I just put in for it two weeks ago. I guess
you found out about it before I did.

If the band goes on, even if Glenn's
not with it, that's the proof.

It means that Glenn's band, Glenn's
