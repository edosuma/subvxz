WEBVTT

00:03.044 --> 00:05.421
(birds chirping)

00:17.809 --> 00:19.970
- What?
- Nothing.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.186
It's not nothing.
It's always something.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.065
Didn't Dad teach you
to tie nai| knots?

00:28.236 --> 00:31.069
Why would he do that?
He only ever used a fisherman's knot.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.068
- One knot.
- No, he didn't.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.703
No, he tied at least three.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.614
Clinch knots?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.373
No way.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.626
Fine, I'm making it up.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.508
( reel clicking )

00:57.974 --> 01:00.090
Did Dad teach you
mostly dry lures?

01:00.268 --> 01:02.350
Yeah. You?

01:02.520 --> 01:05.262
- Wet.
- You're kidding.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.726
But he was always so adamant.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.812
I mean, you know Dad
on the fishing thing.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.487
Gee, you think?

01:11.654 --> 01:14.737
| only spent my entire childhood
with my ass in a boat.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.991
But in my day it was all
about getting the hook seated.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.026
We were fishing
for the dinner table.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.617
Not us.
We always threw them back.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.782
- Always.
- I guess he changed things up.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.087
But that'd be like changing
his religion or something.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.587
People change. It's not his fault
we were born 12 years apart.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.044
No.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.382
No, because the minute
you went off to college

01:37.555 --> 01:40.763
it was my ass in that boat and
he taught me dry lures from day one.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.727
This was not behavior
developed over time.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.311
( reel clicks )

01:55.657 --> 01:57.238
You think he did it for us?

01:57.408 --> 01:59.899
( crying ) Because he knew
we were so different.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.408
( chuckles )

02:04.582 --> 02:08.040
He knew that you needed
to catch the fish

02:08.211 --> 02:10.748
and I needed to throw them back.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.502
( inhales )
All right, remember his rule:

02:15.677 --> 02:17.633
no crying in the boat.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.761
lt scares the fish.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.761
Mom and Dad--

02:24.811 --> 02:26.267
I mean,

02:26.437 --> 02:29.645
maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.728
Maybe it's better there.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.893
Do you think?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.110
( reel clicks, whirrs )

02:40.285 --> 02:42.867
I think you have a bite.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.653
Even with the wrong knots.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.665
-( reel clicking )
- ( sniffles )

02:48.835 --> 02:50.666
Oh God.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.327
(sighs)

02:52.505 --> 02:55.167
So much for the no crying rule.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.253
I think that was more
for Dad than the fish.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.870
(shovel scraping )

03:47.685 --> 03:50.301
(theme music playing )

04:31.646 --> 04:33.853
(shouts)

04:42.448 --> 04:46.987
I won't hesitate. I don't care
if every walker in the city hears it.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.796
You got a do-rag or something?

05:17.358 --> 05:19.098
(sighs)

05:21.029 --> 05:24.487
I guess the saw blade was
too dull for the handcuffs.

05:26.617 --> 05:28.994
Ain't that a bitch.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.178
He must have used a tourniquet--
maybe his belt.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.438
Be much more blood
if he didn't.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.555
Merle? You in here?

06:49.992 --> 06:52.984
Jim? You okay?

06:58.876 --> 07:02.118
You keep this up,
you're gonna keel over out here.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.174
Drink some water at least.

07:23.901 --> 07:26.062
(growling)

07:27.613 --> 07:28.819
(thuds)

07:46.466 --> 07:50.129
Daryl: Had enough in him
to take out these two sumbitches

07:51.345 --> 07:53.006
one handed.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.682
Toughest asshole
I ever met, my brother.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.308
(grunts)

07:59.479 --> 08:01.640
Feed him a hammer,
he'd crap out nails.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.770
Any man can pass out
from blood loss,

08:03.941 --> 08:06.193
no matter how tough he is.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.901
Morales:
Oh, baby. Will you look at that?

08:13.075 --> 08:15.782
Hey, check it out.
( laughs )

08:17.914 --> 08:19.245
- Ladies...
- ( clapping )

08:19.415 --> 08:22.623
...because of you
my children will eat tonight.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.579
- Thank you.
- Thank Dale.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.665
It's his canoe and gear.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.795
Carl:
Mom, look. Look at all the fish.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.797
Thank you.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.754
- ( chuckles )
- Whoa.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.887
Yeah, whoa.
Where did you two learn to do that?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.548
- Our dad.
- Can you teach me how to do that?

08:38.726 --> 08:41.809
Sure. I'll teach you all
about nail knots and stuff.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.721
- If that's okay.
- You won't catch me arguing.

08:44.899 --> 08:48.687
Hey, Dale. When's the last time
you oiled those line reels?

08:48.861 --> 08:51.443
- They are a disgrace.
- |, uh--

08:51.614 --> 08:53.570
I don't want to alarm anyone,

08:53.741 --> 08:56.483
but we may have
a bit of a problem.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.375
- Merle!
- We're not alone here.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.465
- Remember?
- Screw that.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.472
He could be bleeding out.
You said so yourself.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.993
Glenn:
What's that burned stuff?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.575
Skin.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.865
He cauterized the stump.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.920
Told you he was tough.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.956
Nobody can kill
Merle but Merle.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.922
Don't take that on faith.
He's lost a lot of blood.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.597
Yeah?

09:58.764 --> 10:01.927
Didn't stop him from busting
out of this death trap.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.182
He left the building?

10:04.353 --> 10:05.729
Why the hell would he do that?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.181
Daryl:
Why wouldn't he?

10:07.356 --> 10:10.974
He's out there alone
as far as he knows,

10:11.152 --> 10:12.733
doing what he's got to do.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.110
Surviving.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.488
T-Dog:
You call that surviving?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.070
Just wandering out in the streets,
maybe passing out?

10:20.244 --> 10:21.859
What are his odds out there?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.996
No worse than being handcuffed
and left to rot by you sorry pricks.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.749
You couldn't kill him.

10:28.919 --> 10:32.503
Ain't so worried about
some dumb dead bastard.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.413
What about 1,000
dumb dead bastards?

10:34.592 --> 10:36.878
- Different story?
- Why don't you take a tally?

10:37.053 --> 10:39.260
Do what you want.
I'm gonna go get him.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.546
- Daryl, wait.
- Get your hands off me!

10:41.724 --> 10:43.555
- You can't stop me.
- I don't blame you.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.263
He's family, | get that.
I went through hell to find mine.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.177
I know exactly how you feel.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.810
He can't get far
with that injury.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.565
We could help you check
a few blocks around

10:53.736 --> 10:56.443
but only if we keep a level head.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.649
I could do that.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.991
Only if we get those guns first.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.746
I'm not strolling
the streets of Atlanta

11:07.917 --> 11:10.124
with just my good intentions, okay?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.604
Hey, Jim.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.525
Jim, why don't you
hold up, all right?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.312
- Just give me a second here, please.
- What do you want?

11:39.490 --> 11:42.072
We're all just
a little concerned, man. That's all.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.609
Dale says you've been
out here for hours.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.699
-So?
- So why are you digging?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.661
Are you heading to China, Jim?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.452
What does it matter?
I'm not hurting anyone.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.040
Yeah, except maybe yourself.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.457
lt's 100° today.
You can't keep this up.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.546
Sure I can. Watch me.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.928
Jim, they're not
gonna say it so I will.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.384
You're scaring people.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.016
You're scaring my son
and Carol's daughter.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.519
They got nothing to be scared of.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.397
I mean, what the hell, people?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.433
I'm out here by myself.
Why don't you all just go

12:17.611 --> 12:20.648
and leave me the hell alone?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.860
We think that you need
to take a break, okay?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.366
Why don't you go and get
yourself in the shade?

12:26.537 --> 12:28.277
Some food maybe.
I'll tell you what--

12:28.456 --> 12:30.617
maybe in a little bit
I'll come out here

12:30.791 --> 12:32.873
and help you myself.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.783
Jim, just tell me what it's about.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.748
Why don't you just go ahead
and give me that shovel?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.208
- Or what?
- There is no or what.

12:39.383 --> 12:42.500
I'm asking you. I'm coming to you
and I'm asking you, please.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.214
I don't want to have
to take it from you.

12:44.388 --> 12:47.095
And if I don't, then what?

12:47.266 --> 12:49.803
Then you're gonna
beat my face in

12:49.977 --> 12:52.059
like Ed Peletier, aren't you?

12:52.229 --> 12:55.596
Y'all seen his face, huh?
What's left of it.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.562
See, now that's what happens
when someone crosses you.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.522
That was different, Jim.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.938
You weren't there. Ed was out
of control. He was hurting his wife.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.572
That is their marriage.
That is not his.

13:05.743 --> 13:09.031
He is notjudge and jury.
Who voted you king boss, huh?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.866
Shane: Jim, I'm not here
to argue with you, all right?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.996
- Just give me the shovel, okay?
- No no no.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.829
- Just give me the-- Jim!
- ( grunts)

13:16.003 --> 13:17.789
- Okay, shh shh.
- You got no right!

13:17.963 --> 13:19.544
- Stop. Shh.
- You got no right!

13:19.715 --> 13:21.501
Jim, just stop it.
Hey hey hey hey.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.757
- Don't!
- Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.668
You hear me? Shh.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.178
Jim, nobody is gonna
hurt you, okay?

13:28.349 --> 13:31.182
That's a lie.
That's the biggest lie there is.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.640
I told that to my wife
and my two boys.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.432
I said it 100 times.
It didn't matter.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.897
They came out of nowhere.
There were dozens of 'em.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.779
Just pulled 'em
right out of my hands.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.824
You know, the only reason
I got away was

13:52.998 --> 13:55.660
'cause the dead were
too busy eating my family.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.299
You're not doing this alone.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.630
Daryl: Even lthink it's a bad idea
and I don't even like you much.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.263
It's a good idea, okay,
if you just hear me out.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.845
If we go out there in a group,

14:14.019 --> 14:15.850
we're slow, drawing attention.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.808
If I'm alone, I can move fast.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.645
Look.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.686
That's the tank, five blocks
from where we are now.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.570
That's the bag of guns.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.992
Here's the alley I dragged
you into when we first met.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.150
- That's where Daryl and I will go.
- Why me?

14:31.328 --> 14:33.535
Your crossbow is quieter
than his gun.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.874
While Daryl waits here in the alley,

14:39.044 --> 14:40.705
I run up the street,
grab the bag.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.336
You got us elsewhere?

14:42.506 --> 14:43.712
Glenn:
You and T-Dog, right.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.714
You'll be in this alley here.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.375
Two blocks away? Why?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.384
I may not be able to
come back the same way.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.386
Walkers might cut me off.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.889
If that happens,
I won't go back to Daryl.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.924
I'll go forward instead,

14:56.103 --> 14:58.344
all the way around to that
alley where you guys are.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.183
Whichever direction I go,

15:00.357 --> 15:03.224
I got you in both places
to cover me.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.903
Afterwards,
we'll all meet back here.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.356
Hey, kid, what'd you do
before all this?

15:07.531 --> 15:11.240
Delivered pizzas. Why?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.806
You got some balls
for a Chinaman.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.521
- l'm Korean.
- Whatever.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.089
( growls )

16:16.100 --> 16:17.931
Whoa, don't shoot me!
What do you want?

16:18.102 --> 16:20.434
I'm looking for my brother.
He's hurt real bad. You seen him?

16:20.604 --> 16:21.810
- Ayudame!
- Shut up!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.972
You're gonna bring the geeks
down on us. Answer me.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.272
(growling)

16:35.995 --> 16:39.032
- Answer me.
- Ayudame!

16:39.206 --> 16:40.821
Ayudame!

16:42.334 --> 16:44.666
Ayudame!

16:44.837 --> 16:46.998
- Daryl: Shut up. Shut up.
- ( muffled screaming )

16:47.172 --> 16:48.423
Shut up.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.169
Shut up.

16:58.308 --> 17:01.596
That's it. That's the bag, vato.
Take it! Take it!

17:01.770 --> 17:04.147
Ah! Ah!

17:05.691 --> 17:07.522
( screams )

17:07.693 --> 17:09.649
( car approaches )

17:09.820 --> 17:12.983
Get off me!
Get off me!

17:13.157 --> 17:15.523
Daryl! Daryl!

17:15.701 --> 17:16.861
Daryl!

17:18.120 --> 17:19.860
(tires squealing )

17:20.039 --> 17:21.950
Come back here,

17:22.124 --> 17:23.910
you sumbitches!

17:29.214 --> 17:31.079
(shouts)

17:31.258 --> 17:33.499
Whoa whoa whoa. Stop it.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.338
I'm gonna kick your nuts
up in your throat!

17:35.512 --> 17:36.922
- Let me go.
- Chill out.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.928
They took Glenn.
That little bastard

17:39.099 --> 17:40.475
and his little bastard
homie friends.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.178
I'm gonna stomp your ass!

17:42.352 --> 17:43.967
Guys! Guys! We're cut off!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.808
Get to the lab. Go.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.646
Come on.
Damn, let's go.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.700
Jim, take some water?

18:07.878 --> 18:09.414
- All right.
- Yeah?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.579
All right.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.466
Here you go, bud.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.222
Pour some on my head?

18:23.393 --> 18:25.008
Yeah.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.187
Cooling you down, huh?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.102
Yeah.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.032
How long you gonna
keep me like this?

18:41.203 --> 18:43.114
Well, yeah.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.119
Until I don't think that
you're a danger to yourself

18:45.290 --> 18:47.667
or others.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.666
Sorry if I scared your boy
and your little girl.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.924
You had sunstroke.
Nobody's blaming you.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.805
You're not scared now, are you?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.341
No sir.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.269
Your mama's right.
Sun just cooked my head is all.

19:16.446 --> 19:19.062
Jim, do you know
why you were digging?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.991
Can you say?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.824
I had a reason.
Don't remember.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.704
Something I dreamt last night.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.213
Your dad was in it.
You were too.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.670
You were worried about him.
Can't remember the rest.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.212
You worried about your dad?

19:43.390 --> 19:46.177
They're not back yet.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.342
We don't need
to talk about that.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.056
Your dad's a police officer, son.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.845
He helps people.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.731
Probably just came across
some folks needing help, that's all.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.484
That man,
he is tough as nails.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.612
I don't know him well but...

20:01.783 --> 20:03.444
I could see it in him.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.859
Am I right?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.198
Oh yeah.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.661
There ain't nothing gonna
stop him from getting back here

20:12.836 --> 20:14.918
to you and your mom,
I promise you that.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.167
All right.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.553
Who wants to help me
clean some fish, huh?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.509
Carl:
Sweet. Come on, Sophia.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.220
Lori:
Stay with Carol, all right?

20:48.872 --> 20:50.703
You keep your boy close.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.911
You don't ever let him
out of your sight.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.091
Those men you were with,
we need to know where they went.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.130
I ain't telling you nothing.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.266
Jesus, man.
What the hell happened back there?

21:11.436 --> 21:13.688
I told you, this little turd
and his douche bag friends

21:13.855 --> 21:15.436
came out of nowhere
and jumped me.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.472
You're the one
whojumped me, puto,

21:17.651 --> 21:20.313
screaming about trying to find
his brother like it's my damn fault.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.603
They took Glenn.
Could have taken Merle too.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.067
Merle? What kind of
hick name is that?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.107
I wouldn't name my dog Merle.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.652
Damn it, Daryl. Back off.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.454
Want to see what happened
to the last guy that pissed me off?

21:45.178 --> 21:46.554
( screams )

21:47.639 --> 21:50.631
Start with the feet this time.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.015
The men you were with
took our friend.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.474
All we want to do
is talk to them,

21:57.649 --> 21:59.105
see if we can work
something out.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.697
( rattles )

22:07.868 --> 22:09.324
You sure you're up for this?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.780
- Yeah.
- Okay.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.661
One wrong move,

22:16.835 --> 22:18.700
you get an arrow in the ass.
Just so you know.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.870
G's gonna take that
arrow out of my ass

22:21.048 --> 22:23.505
and shove it up yours.
Just so you know.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.166
- G?
- Guillermo.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.801
He's the man here.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.177
Okay then.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.680
- ( cocks gun )
- Let's go see Guillermo.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.593
- ( lock clacks )
- ( doors creaking )

23:23.235 --> 23:25.066
You okay, little man?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.229
They're gonna cut off
my feet, carnal.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.897
Cops do that?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.908
Not him. This redneck puto here.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.034
He cut off some dude's hand, man.
He showed it to me.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.912
- Shut up.
- Hey, that's that vato right there.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.199
He shot me in the ass with an arrow.
What's up, homes, huh?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.538
Chill, ese, chill. Chill.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.871
This true?

23:46.049 --> 23:48.290
He wants Miguelito's feet?

23:48.468 --> 23:49.799
That's pretty sick, man.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.757
We were hoping more
for a calm discussion.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.592
That hillbilly jumps
Felipe's little cousin,

23:54.766 --> 23:56.097
beats on him,
threatens to cut off his feet,

23:56.268 --> 23:57.678
Felipe gets an arrow in the ass

23:57.853 --> 24:00.265
and you want a calm discussion?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.805
You fascinate me.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.519
Heat of the moment.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.605
Mistakes were made on both sides.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.813
Who's that dude to you anyway?
You don't look related.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.734
He's one of our group, more or less.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.947
I'm sure you have a few like him.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.238
Daryl:
You got my brother in there?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.782
Guillermo:
Sorry, we're fresh out of white boys.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.121
But I've got Asian.
You interested?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.833
l have one of yours,
you have one of mine.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.998
Sounds like an even trade.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.213
- Don't sound even to me.
- G.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.469
- Come on, man.
- Guillermo: My people got attacked.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.630
Where's the compensation
for their pain and suffering?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.969
More to the point,
where's my bag of guns?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.760
- Guns?
- The bag Miguel saw in the street.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.644
The bag Felipe and Jorge
were going back to get.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.646
- That bag of guns.
- You're mistaken.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.978
- I don't think so.
- Rick: About it being yours.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.485
It's my bag of guns.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.441
The bag was in the street.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.652
Anybody could come around
and say it was theirs.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.818
I'm supposed to take your word?

24:57.996 --> 24:59.702
What's to stop my people
from unloading on you

24:59.873 --> 25:01.704
right here and now
and I take what's mine?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.205
You could do that.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.500
Or not.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.089
Come on, man. Make the trade.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.128
Please.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.511
Oye.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.690
(whimpers)

25:34.157 --> 25:36.193
Guillermo:
| see two options.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.734
You come back with Miguel
and my bag of guns,

25:38.912 --> 25:40.493
everybody walks.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.700
Or you come back
locked and loaded,

25:42.874 --> 25:45.081
we'll see which side
spills more blood.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.588
( clacking )

26:06.731 --> 26:08.187
Them guns are worth
more than gold.

26:08.358 --> 26:12.146
Gold won't protect your family
or put food on the table.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.901
You willing to give that up
for that kid?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.481
T-Dog: If I knew we'd get
Glenn back, I might agree.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.116
But you think that vato across the way
isjust gonna hand him over?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.323
- You calling G a liar?
- Are you a part of this?

26:22.497 --> 26:24.579
You want to hold onto your teeth?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.243
Question is,
do you trust that man's word?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.537
Daryl: No, question is
what are you willing to bet on it?

26:31.715 --> 26:34.297
Could be more than them guns.
Could be your life.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.503
Glenn worth that to you?

26:38.805 --> 26:41.296
What life l have I owe to him.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.055
l was nobody to Glenn,

26:43.226 --> 26:45.933
just some idiot stuck in a tank.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.186
He could have walked away,
but he didn't.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.732
Neither will I.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.400
So you're gonna hand
the guns over?

26:52.527 --> 26:54.028
I didn't say that.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.317
There's nothing keeping you two here.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.447
You should get out,
head back to camp.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.155
And tell your family what?

27:14.841 --> 27:17.127
Come on, this is nuts.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.300
Just do like G says.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.812
(door clacking )

27:54.547 --> 27:57.789
| see my guns
but they're not all in the bag.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.673
That's because they're not yours.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.459
I thought I mentioned that.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.469
Let's just shoot
these fools right now, ese.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.130
All right?
Unload on their asses, ese.

28:05.308 --> 28:08.926
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.015
No, I'm pretty clear.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.526
You have your man.
I want mine.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.482
I'm gonna chop up your boy.
I'm gonna feed him to my dogs.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.572
They're the evilest, nastiest
man-eating bitches you ever saw.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.702
I picked them up
from Satan at a yard sale.

28:29.999 --> 28:32.035
I told you how it has to be.
Are you woefully deaf?

28:32.210 --> 28:35.077
No, my hearing's fine.
You said come locked and loaded.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.717
Okay then, we're here.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.890
Woman:
FerelFere!

28:50.061 --> 28:54.304
Abuela, go back
with the others-- now.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.642
Get that old lady out
of the line of fire!

28:55.817 --> 28:58.149
Abuela, listen to your m'hijo, okay?

28:58.319 --> 28:59.820
This is the not the place
for you right now.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.071
Mr. Gilbert is having
trouble breathing.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.823
He needs his asthma stuff.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.450
Carlito didn't find it.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.906
He needs his medicine.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.582
Felipe, go take care of it, okay?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.118
And take your
grandmother with you.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.127
( Felipe speaks Spanish )

29:18.298 --> 29:20.835
Who are those men?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.591
-( Felipe speaks Spanish )
_ Don't you take him.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.844
- Ma'am?
- Felipe's a good boy.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.097
He have his trouble
but he pull himself together.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.054
We need him here.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.435
Ma'am,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.847
I'm not here to arrest
your grandson.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.856
Then what do you want him for?

29:39.027 --> 29:41.860
He's...

29:42.030 --> 29:44.021
helping us find a missing person.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.564
Fella named Glenn.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.154
The Asian boy?

29:48.328 --> 29:50.614
He's with Mr. Gilbert.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.952
Come. Come, | show you.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.332
He needs his medicine.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.127
Let 'em pass.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.186
- ( man coughing)
-( people whispering )

30:28.701 --> 30:31.113
Abuela, por favor.
Take me to him.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.332
(people coughing)

31:03.361 --> 31:04.862
All right. All right.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.520
Nice and easy. Just breathe.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.735
Just breathe. Just let it out.
Just breathe.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.900
( inhaler hisses )

31:13.204 --> 31:14.580
Woman:
Just relax.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.414
- What the hell is this?
- An asthma attack.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.541
Couldn't get his breath
all of a sudden.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.249
I thought you were being
eaten by dogs, man.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.674
( barks )

31:27.844 --> 31:30.711
Could I have a word with you?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.426
You're the dumbest
son of a bitch I ever met.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.387
We walked in there ready
to kill every last one of you.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.347
Well, I'm glad
it didn't go down that way.

31:38.521 --> 31:42.730
If it had, that blood
would be on my hands.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.937
Mine too.
We'd have fought back.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.817
Wouldn't be
the first time we've had to.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.572
Protect the food, the medicine--
what's left of it.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.607
These people, the old ones--

31:52.785 --> 31:55.276
the staff took off,
just left 'em here to die.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.251
Me and Felipe were
the only ones who stayed.

32:03.421 --> 32:06.629
What are you, doctors?

32:06.799 --> 32:10.291
Felipe's a nurse--
a special care provider.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.927
Me,

32:13.097 --> 32:15.759
I'm the custodian.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.435
What about the rest of your crew?

32:29.614 --> 32:31.605
The vatos trickle in

32:31.783 --> 32:33.944
to check on their parents,
their grandparents.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.076
They see how things are
and most decide to stay.

32:37.246 --> 32:40.113
It's a good thing too.
We need the muscle.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.579
The people we've encountered
since things fell apart,

32:43.753 --> 32:46.415
the worst kind-- plunderers,

32:46.589 --> 32:48.454
the kind that take by force.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.340
- That's not who we are.
- Guillermo: How was I to know?

32:51.511 --> 32:54.594
My people got attacked and you
show up with Miguel hostage--

32:54.764 --> 32:57.130
appearances.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.765
Guess the world changed.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.972
Guillermo: No.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.309
It's the same as it ever was.
The weak get taken.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.525
So we do what we can here.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.687
The vatos work on those cars,

33:11.864 --> 33:13.650
talk about getting
the old people out of the city.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.941
But most can't even get to
the bathroom by themselves,

33:16.119 --> 33:17.950
so that's just a dream.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.112
Still, it keeps the crew busy,

33:20.289 --> 33:22.154
and that's worth something.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.287
So we barred all the windows,

33:25.461 --> 33:27.622
welded all the doors shut
except for one entrance.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.162
The vatos, they go out,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.672
scavenge what they can
to keep us going.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.506
We watch the perimeter
night and day and we wait.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.048
The people here,

33:40.226 --> 33:43.593
they all look to me now.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.308
I don't even know why.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.017
Because they can.

34:10.923 --> 34:13.585
Glenn: Admit it, you only came back
to Atlanta for the hat.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.296
Rick:
Don't tell anybody.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.301
Daryl: You've given away
half our guns and ammo.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.508
- Rick: Not nearly half.
- Daryl: For what?

34:19.682 --> 34:21.673
Bunch of old farts who are
gonna die off momentarily anyhow?

34:21.851 --> 34:23.887
Seriously,
how long you think they got?

34:24.062 --> 34:26.895
How long do any of us?

34:29.859 --> 34:32.521
- Glenn: Oh my God.
- Where the hell's our van?

34:32.695 --> 34:33.730
We left it right there.
Who would take it?

34:33.905 --> 34:35.065
Merle.

34:37.700 --> 34:40.237
He's gonna be taking
some vengeance back to camp.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.751
Wrapping paper,
color tissue, anything?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.256
Dale:
Seriously?

34:55.426 --> 34:56.962
How can you not have any?

34:57.136 --> 35:00.594
Had I been informed of the impending
apocalypse I'd have stocked up.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.256
lt's Amy's birthday tomorrow.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.551
I've been marking days
on the calendarjust to make sure.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.401
Deep breath.

35:15.571 --> 35:18.153
I'm sure I'll find something here.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.573
l, uh, built up
the rocks all around.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.742
See? So the flames can
be a little higher

35:30.920 --> 35:32.285
and have 'em be hidden.

35:35.883 --> 35:37.464
Hey, Jim.
How you feeling, man?

35:37.635 --> 35:40.672
I'm better.
More myself now.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.883
I hope you understand
the need for this--

35:43.057 --> 35:45.093
this timeout.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.759
I've got others
I've got to think about.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.553
| just want to
make sure there's no--

35:50.731 --> 35:52.471
there's no hard feelings.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.141
There's not. I do understand.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.605
Okay.
( chuckles )

35:57.780 --> 36:00.157
Why don't you come
join in with the rest of us?

36:00.324 --> 36:02.315
Big ol' fish fry.

36:04.579 --> 36:07.161
- I'd like that very much.
- Shane: Okay.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.494
( plastic rustles )

36:10.668 --> 36:12.329
Why don't you come outside
with everybody?

36:12.503 --> 36:14.960
Hell with them people.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.247
Wouldn't piss on them
if their heads was on fire.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.211
Hey!

36:20.386 --> 36:22.593
Why don't you stay here?

36:22.763 --> 36:24.014
Keep your daddy company.

36:25.725 --> 36:29.183
Ed, she wants to join in.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.935
- Come on.
- Ed: Fine.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.767
Hell with the both of you.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.273
Ain't no need to be bothering me
no more the rest of the night.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.733
( all panting )

36:46.078 --> 36:49.036
- ( people laugh )
- Sophia: Pass the fish, please.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.540
- Carol: Here you go.
- Shane: Man 0 man, that's good.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.951
Whew.
( chuckles )

36:55.129 --> 36:57.120
I miss this.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.183
I've got to ask you, man.
It's been driving me crazy.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.389
- Dale: What?
- That watch.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.013
What's wrong with my watch?

37:16.192 --> 37:19.150
| see you every day,
the same time,

37:19.320 --> 37:21.686
winding that thing

37:21.864 --> 37:23.570
like a village priest saying mass.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.823
I've wondered this myself.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.780
- I'm missing the point.
- Jacqui: Unless l've misread the signs,

37:28.955 --> 37:32.072
the world seems to
have come to an end.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.741
At least hit a speed bump
for a good long while.

37:34.919 --> 37:38.036
But there's you every day
winding that stupid watch.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.923
Time-- it's important
to keep track, isn't it?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.334
The days at least.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.922
Don't you think, Andrea?

37:46.097 --> 37:48.133
- Back me up here.
- ( chuckles )

37:52.895 --> 37:55.307
llike-- I like what, um,

37:55.481 --> 37:59.224
a father said to son
when he gave him a watch

37:59.402 --> 38:03.145
that had been handed down
through generations.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.608
He said,

38:05.783 --> 38:09.776
"I give you the mausoleum

38:09.954 --> 38:12.536
of all hope and desire,

38:12.707 --> 38:16.074
which will fit
your individual needs

38:16.252 --> 38:19.961
no better than it did mine
or my father's before me;

38:20.131 --> 38:22.122
I give it to you

38:22.300 --> 38:26.384
not that you may remember time,

38:26.554 --> 38:30.342
but that you may forget it
for a moment

38:30.516 --> 38:33.007
now and then

38:33.185 --> 38:37.428
and not spend all of your breath
trying to conquer it."

38:46.824 --> 38:48.439
You are so weird.

38:48.617 --> 38:49.777
(all laugh)

38:49.952 --> 38:51.988
It's not me. It's Faulkner.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.655
William Faulkner.
Maybe my bad paraphrasing.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.831
- Where are you going?
- l have to pee.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.842
Jeez, you try to be
discreet around here--

39:08.012 --> 39:11.300
( laughs)

39:11.474 --> 39:14.011
( rustling )

39:14.185 --> 39:17.018
Thought I told y'all to leave
me the hell alone, didn't I?

39:19.857 --> 39:21.722
Hey!

39:23.861 --> 39:26.352
- What'd I say?
- ( growling )

39:26.530 --> 39:27.861
Oh!

39:29.533 --> 39:31.194
We're out of toilet paper?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.200
(growling)

39:37.500 --> 39:39.240
( gasps, screaming )

39:45.257 --> 39:46.713
( people screaming )

39:46.884 --> 39:49.751
- Carl: Mom!
-Loﬁ:Caﬂ!

39:51.555 --> 39:53.887
Lori, get him down!

39:58.104 --> 40:00.811
- ( guns firing)
- Oh my God.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.437
T-Dog: Go! Go!

40:02.608 --> 40:04.940
(woman, children screaming )

40:16.914 --> 40:18.620
Lori: I'm right here.
Shane, what do we do?

40:18.791 --> 40:21.123
- Shane?
- Follow me!

40:21.293 --> 40:23.454
(screaming )

40:26.215 --> 40:28.581
No! No!

40:31.762 --> 40:33.923
Oh! Oh!

40:34.098 --> 40:35.929
Oh God!
Oh my God!

40:36.100 --> 40:38.933
( groans )
Help me.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.219
Oh God, I don't know what to do.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.637
I don't know what to do.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.727
(crying)

40:45.901 --> 40:47.766
- Come on. Come on, stay close.
- Carol!

40:47.945 --> 40:49.401
Shane:
Stay close!

40:49.572 --> 40:52.109
(screaming )

40:58.789 --> 41:01.405
Come on, y'all!
Work your way up here!

41:01.584 --> 41:03.666
Lori:
Right in front of you. Shane!

41:04.670 --> 41:07.286
Morales:
Get to the RV! Go!

41:07.465 --> 41:10.127
- Lori: Shane! Shane!
- Shane: Stay with me.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.511
Stay behind me.
Morales, work up here!

41:15.681 --> 41:18.514
- Lori: Get behind me! Come on!
- Shane: Let's go!

41:18.684 --> 41:20.265
- ( girl screaming)
- Lori: Stay with me.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.768
Shane: Come on, make your way
to the Winnebago!

41:22.938 --> 41:25.805
- ( gunshots)
- ( shouting )

41:44.752 --> 41:47.539
Baby! Carl!

41:47.713 --> 41:48.793
Baby!

41:48.964 --> 41:50.670
- Dad!
- Carl!

41:50.841 --> 41:54.425
(crying)

42:06.482 --> 42:09.189
( panting )

42:10.986 --> 42:13.523
(sobbing )

42:13.697 --> 42:14.982
Shh shh shh.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.493
Oh, Amy.

42:23.165 --> 42:25.030
(gags)

42:28.671 --> 42:33.165
I don't know what to do, Amy.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.582
Oh. Oh.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.256
Oh.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.720
Oh.

43:23.475 --> 43:26.888
Oh. Oh.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.434
Oh, Amy.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.775
(crying)

43:45.873 --> 43:48.956
Oh no no.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.456
Amy!

43:54.798 --> 43:56.459
(wailing )Amy!

43:56.634 --> 43:58.966
Amy!

43:59.136 --> 44:01.297
I remember my dream now,

44:01.472 --> 44:04.088
why I dug the holes.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.022
(music playing )
