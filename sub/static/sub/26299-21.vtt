00:01.580 --> 00:03.760
72, 72, $72!

00:03.800 --> 00:05.540
$72, 72 bid, 72 bid,

00:05.590 --> 00:07.590
75, 75, 75!Oh, boy.

00:07.630 --> 00:10.380
Is it already the first day of
livestock auction season again?

00:10.420 --> 00:11.700
It's the same day
every year, Mitchell...

00:11.720 --> 00:13.570
A fortnight after
the first ripe tomato comes in.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.560
And seriously? Thisis what passes
for auction calling these days?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.690
Is it possible
you're being a tad harsh?

00:18.730 --> 00:20.580
You know, when you've beenat
the top of your field...

00:20.600 --> 00:22.650
Greater Bug CountyAuction-Calling Champ

00:22.690 --> 00:23.820
three years running...

00:23.870 --> 00:25.830
It's hard to see anythingbut
the inadequacies.

00:25.870 --> 00:27.630
It's why Baryshnikovcouldn't
watch others dance.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.700
What? He was
the Artistic Director of...

00:29.740 --> 00:31.610
How long have you
lived in this house?!

00:31.660 --> 00:33.640
It's gonna wind up being
some pig named Baryshnikov

00:33.660 --> 00:35.490
or some damn thing.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.190
So, how wasyour trumpet lesson?

00:38.230 --> 00:39.490
It was amazing. Yeah.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.710
Oh, these sessions just have
really changed my life.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.670
Technically, uh, not a lie.

00:44.710 --> 00:47.410
Uh, I started taking
trumpet lessons two years ago.

00:47.460 --> 00:48.980
But then I noticed
the place next door

00:49.020 --> 00:52.160
was offering massages
for the same price, so...

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
you know.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.730
And I felt bad relaxing
while Cam was...

00:56.770 --> 00:58.160
solo-parenting Lily.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.730
But... Butwe were
both spending time

01:00.770 --> 01:03.250
with an Asian woman
who walked all over us.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.650
You always smell like lavender

01:04.690 --> 01:05.840
when you come back
from that place.

01:05.870 --> 01:07.520
Uh, yeah, it's the...
It's the valve oil

01:07.560 --> 01:08.650
for the, um... you know,

01:08.690 --> 01:09.760
the t... the tooting buttons.Oh.

01:09.780 --> 01:11.780
We should probably, uh, hit the road soon.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.610
High school graduation'sin an hour.

01:13.660 --> 01:14.660
It's so humiliating

01:14.700 --> 01:16.790
being the Vice Principal
at these things.

01:16.830 --> 01:18.660
It's just a ceremonial position

01:18.700 --> 01:20.660
where you have to
sit behind Principal Brown,

01:20.710 --> 01:21.620
politely clapping

01:21.660 --> 01:24.060
while hegets to set
the course of history.

01:24.100 --> 01:25.560
Well, it could be funwith my dad giving

01:25.580 --> 01:26.780
the commencement address, though.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.630
I got a peek at his note cards,

01:27.670 --> 01:29.540
and I don't want to give anything away,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.060
but the young kid
who boarded the bus

01:31.110 --> 01:32.630
with the hair full of Brylcreem

01:32.680 --> 01:34.500
and a cardboard suitcasefull of dreams...

01:34.550 --> 01:35.720
It was him.

01:36.810 --> 01:38.850
Oh, I have to take this.
It's Superintendent Pierce.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.250
Hello, good sir.
To what do I owe this honor?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.340
Oh, no.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.080
That's horrible.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.260
Principal Brown
got into a car accident!

01:49.300 --> 01:52.260
W-Which means, as next
in the line of succession,

01:52.300 --> 01:54.440
I get to preside over
today's graduation.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.790
You know, this is why
senior administration officials

01:56.830 --> 01:58.140
never travel together.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.230
Your glee at another
man'smisfortune should trouble me,

02:02.270 --> 02:04.790
but there's also somethingsort
of sexy about it.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.100
Well, power is an aphrodisiac.
Oh.

02:07.140 --> 02:08.380
Maybe lateryou could be the principal

02:08.410 --> 02:10.250
and I could be the studentwho's
a few credits short.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.890
Hmm. A bad, bad boy

02:11.930 --> 02:13.760
who needs to be taughtright from wrong.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.370
'Cause I grew up
in a broken home,

02:15.410 --> 02:18.160
where social workersand
constant fights about money

02:18.200 --> 02:19.240
were just...

02:19.290 --> 02:20.940
Okay, well, now I'm just sad.

Yah! Yah!

02:36.910 --> 02:38.520
Can we switch seats?

02:38.570 --> 02:39.520
I'm right under a vent.

02:39.570 --> 02:41.180
This is not good
for my instrument.

02:41.220 --> 02:45.310
Oh, so nice that you're taking
this speech so seriously.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.580
When you did
Mitch and Cam's wedding toast,

02:47.620 --> 02:49.400
you had your mouth
full of cashews.

02:49.450 --> 02:52.410
Yah! Yah! Yah!

02:52.450 --> 02:54.760
Hey, pay attention
to your brother.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.850
You got him into karate.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.060
Not on purpose.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.110
I just showed hima few
"Pink Panther" movies.

03:00.110 --> 03:01.850
Joe?

03:01.890 --> 03:02.850
Joe?

03:02.900 --> 03:04.510
I-I-I don't want to play

03:04.550 --> 03:06.730
this Inspector Clouseau
and Cato game anymore.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.770
It's not that I'm scared.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.290
It's just,
I-I'm a little busy...

03:10.340 --> 03:11.640
Aah! Aah!

03:11.690 --> 03:13.120
He's a little psycho.

03:13.170 --> 03:15.650
Which we must never show him, by the way.

03:15.690 --> 03:17.910
And sorry if I'm distracted.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.650
It's cut day at CalArts.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.610
Half of the classisn't being asked back.

03:21.650 --> 03:23.350
Manny, my mother's intuition

03:23.390 --> 03:25.960
tells me that you have
nothing to worry about.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.010
It's just so cruel.

03:27.050 --> 03:29.010
I'm halfwayto a playwriting degree

03:29.050 --> 03:30.180
and a minor in mask-making

03:30.230 --> 03:31.770
and they're just gonnathrow
me out on the street

03:31.790 --> 03:32.950
with no way to support myself?

03:32.970 --> 03:35.890
As a wise man will say
in about two hours...

03:35.930 --> 03:39.800
"Be grateful for the rocks
life rolls in your path,

03:39.850 --> 03:43.020
for one day, you'll see them
as stepping stones."

03:43.070 --> 03:44.980
I had that in my "maybe" pile.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.020
Trust yourself, Jay.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.990
Oh, God. It's an e-mail from school.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.950
I don't think I can read
thisin front of people.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.250
Yah!

03:54.290 --> 03:55.470
Let's go, Joe!

03:55.510 --> 03:56.640
Ay!

03:58.040 --> 03:59.170
Ay!

04:06.610 --> 04:08.400
I did it!

04:08.440 --> 04:09.880
I did it! Yes!

04:19.190 --> 04:21.670
Did my mom bribe Sensei Ron?

04:22.890 --> 04:24.240
I knew you could do it, Joe!

04:24.280 --> 04:25.850
My mother's intuitiontold me

04:25.890 --> 04:28.590
that you hadnothing to worry about.

04:28.630 --> 04:32.510
And if she bribed Sensei Ron,
who else did she bribe?

04:32.550 --> 04:34.900
Did I even deserve this?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.030
Do you remember
whengrocery shopping was boring?

04:38.080 --> 04:39.080
I really don't.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.170
As a parent, you don't get

04:42.210 --> 04:44.820
a lot of good, clean, guilt-free victories.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.480
That's why it's hard not to feel

04:46.520 --> 04:48.960
pretty damn good
about ourselves today.

04:49.000 --> 04:49.870
Because this afternoon,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.960
we are going to watchour
daughter Alex graduate...

04:53.010 --> 04:53.960
With honors!

04:54.010 --> 04:56.270
From the world-renownedCaltech.

05:02.490 --> 05:04.760
Their best minds weren't
focusedon the fight song.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.980
Yeah.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.540
I just can't stop smiling

05:07.590 --> 05:10.200
at this picture of Alexin her cap and gown.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.070
It's so surreal
that one of ourkids

05:12.110 --> 05:14.200
could do something so amazing.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.640
I love you both.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.680
So, you two, grab
champagne and flowers for Alex.

05:18.730 --> 05:21.430
We'll, uh... We'll get
some cigars to give to Jay.

05:21.470 --> 05:22.860
Yeah.

05:23.910 --> 05:25.040
Oh, my God.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.280
It's Skip Woosnam. Have you
seen him since he fired you?

05:27.300 --> 05:30.130
Once, at a listing.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.260
I tried to pretendl was
a 3D cutout of myself

05:32.310 --> 05:33.790
to avoid talking to him.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.010
But you know what? Today I
want to talk to him.

05:36.050 --> 05:37.440
I thinkl'll let ol' Skip know

05:37.480 --> 05:39.970
I have a daughtergraduating from Caltech.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.660
No, honey, we are not
the kind of parents

05:41.710 --> 05:44.140
who make ourselves look good
by bragging about our kids.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.970
Then why did weeven have them, Claire?

05:46.020 --> 05:47.510
Are we really
not gonna crow about it

05:47.540 --> 05:49.600
when one of our kidsfinally does
somethingwe can be proud of?

05:49.630 --> 05:51.110
I love you both very much.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.850
I'm comfortablebeing the hot one.

05:57.160 --> 05:58.720
Another record month?

05:58.770 --> 06:00.550
Well, thank you!

06:00.590 --> 06:02.770
You're the greatest butler
on Earth.

06:02.810 --> 06:03.950
Ohp! I got to run.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.170
Phil? Skip!

06:06.210 --> 06:07.780
You son of a gun.
How the hell are you?

06:07.820 --> 06:10.170
Great, great. Business is better than ever.

06:10.210 --> 06:10.950
How about you?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.520
Did you, uh, finally get real cutouts?

06:13.560 --> 06:14.520
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.050
Mine are so realistic and 3D,

06:16.090 --> 06:17.280
you must have been laughing
at one of them like an idiot.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.290
How crazy is it we ran into
each other shopping, huh?

06:19.310 --> 06:21.790
Say, how are your kids?

06:21.830 --> 06:23.010
Terrific. Yeah.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.620
June just, uh,
took a jobat the Container Store.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.550
Impressive. I have a kid that's
interested in space, as well.Yeah.

06:27.580 --> 06:31.020
Considering a job at,
uh... at NASA, actually. Oh.

06:31.060 --> 06:33.710
Yeah, he, uh,
looks likehe's got the right stuff.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.200
No, I... it's... I was talking
about my daughter.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.980
Oh. Hey, Dad. Dad, guess what.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.640
The twins started kicking
the second I picked up booze.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.030
They're my kids, right?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.900
My otherdaughter.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.380
Okay, I'm doing
a little thing about

06:50.430 --> 06:51.620
following your dreams in mine.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.010
Do you have anything like that
in yours?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.060
I say "follow your passions."

06:54.080 --> 06:56.040
Okay, yeah.
That's different enough.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.870
Okay.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.610
Something fishy's
going on over here.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.870
I'm gonna go shake some trees,
see what falls.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.830
Looking lovely today,
Vice Principal Tucker.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.880
Cut the choirboy act, Pitkowski.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.380
Oh, you don't like
the way I'm talking to you?

07:09.400 --> 07:10.880
Well, who are you
gonna complain to?

07:10.930 --> 07:11.970
No one!

07:12.010 --> 07:13.620
Because I'mthe acting principal,

07:13.670 --> 07:15.370
clothed in immense power!

07:17.850 --> 07:19.110
Wait, what is... Nope!

07:19.150 --> 07:21.200
I bend faster.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.590
"Jay Pritchett, Owl Killer"?!

07:22.630 --> 07:23.680
What the hell is this?

07:24.810 --> 07:26.810
The year was 1972.

07:26.850 --> 07:27.990
I landed a whale...

07:28.030 --> 07:30.990
Every closet
on a Carnival Cruise ship.

07:31.030 --> 07:32.640
To make the numbers work,

07:32.690 --> 07:35.340
I needed a lot of cedar
fast and cheap.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.360
I ended up cutting down a
forestthat happened to be

07:37.390 --> 07:40.610
the last habitat
of the Golden Speckled Owl.

07:40.650 --> 07:43.610
You know, nobody talks about
all the mice I saved.

07:43.650 --> 07:44.920
Nope!

07:44.960 --> 07:46.480
Just the owls.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.220
Are you all planning
some sort of protest?

07:48.270 --> 07:50.570
Well, that ain't happening
on my watch.

07:50.620 --> 07:51.440
Now go take your seats!

07:51.490 --> 07:53.230
"Owl Hitler"?!

07:54.580 --> 07:57.360
What the hell is this picture?
I never strangled an owl!

07:57.410 --> 08:00.150
Is it too much for Dylan
to let me know where he is?

08:00.190 --> 08:02.020
My water could literally break
any minute.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.410
Am I okay sitting here,

08:03.460 --> 08:06.240
or am I in a SeaWorld
splash zone situation?

08:06.290 --> 08:09.030
Claire, your old high school
nemesis Ashley Walls,

08:09.070 --> 08:10.590
did she have a daughter?

08:10.640 --> 08:12.290
Uh, I don't think so. Why?

08:12.340 --> 08:14.270
Well, that woman over there looks
just like Ashley, but it can't be.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.900
She looks half your... beauty.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.910
Ashley Walls.

08:18.950 --> 08:20.950
She outdid me at everything.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.090
Homecoming Queen,
Field Hockey Captain,

08:24.130 --> 08:26.090
and the summer
before we went away to college,

08:26.130 --> 08:27.480
she beat me out
for an internship

08:27.520 --> 08:28.830
at Pritchett's closets.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.050
Claire?

08:31.090 --> 08:32.309
Hi.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.830
I... want to say...

08:33.880 --> 08:34.840
Ashley?

08:34.880 --> 08:35.840
Yes!

08:35.880 --> 08:37.620
How are you? Good.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.059
Hi.Ashley Walls-Carnegie.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.450
Phillip Humphrey Dunphy.

08:40.490 --> 08:43.150
So, what have you
been up to, Ashley?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.190
Uh, well, I'm a personal injury lawyer.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.330
Mm.I have a buddy
that makes bank from that.

08:47.370 --> 08:48.110
Oh? He's not a lawyer.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.500
He just tries to get
nice cars to hit him.

08:50.550 --> 08:51.910
Yeah, he's just kidding.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.120
No, I'm not, Mom.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.480
In fact, I've ac...
Here, have a candy. Hmm?

08:54.510 --> 08:55.640
That was rude.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.140
I just ran into
my old health teacher,

08:57.160 --> 08:58.690
and she said she always expected

08:58.730 --> 09:01.300
to see me pregnant
at graduation.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.300
Congratulations.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.300
Oh, thanks. Twins.

09:03.340 --> 09:05.520
Sorry, I'd be
a lot happier about it

09:05.560 --> 09:07.170
if I could
track their father down.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.480
Candy.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.000
Oh, look... it's your brother, Mitch.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.680
Now, he was alwaysa little
uptight, wasn't he?

09:12.700 --> 09:15.350
Well, he was in high school,
but now he's just the most...

09:15.400 --> 09:16.510
Okay, you have one job today,
young lady,

09:16.530 --> 09:17.700
okay, to be supportive.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.250
If your dad makes a joke,
you will laugh.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.140
If he makes a speech,
you will what? Applaud.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.230
Right. I-I-I'm gonnago find my seat.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.100
But it was greatcatching up with
you, Claire.

09:25.150 --> 09:26.540
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.300
No one would blame you
if you mentioned

09:29.330 --> 09:31.980
you had a daughter
graduating from Caltech today.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.110
Yeah.
Honey, the moment has passed.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.290
I'd need a pretty good reason to
just go waltzing over there...

09:37.330 --> 09:39.120
Oh! She dropped her program!

09:39.160 --> 09:40.250
Yes!

09:40.290 --> 09:41.790
Hey, Claire,
you knowhow you're my go-to gal...

09:41.820 --> 09:43.250
Busy. Hey, Phil.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.990
You know howyou're my go-to guy on stuff?

09:46.040 --> 09:47.170
Huh.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.780
I suppose against all odds,
we've become best friends.

09:49.820 --> 09:50.960
Sure.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.780
So, apparently,
some of the students are angry

09:53.830 --> 09:55.410
that I'm givingthe commencement address.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.140
Why?
Who knows whytheir sick minds do anything?

09:58.180 --> 10:00.200
Gotta say though,
it feels goodto be hating hippies again.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.010
Anyway, would you mindgiving
this place a sweep?

10:03.050 --> 10:05.270
See if you noticesomething suspicious.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.930
Consider it done.

10:07.970 --> 10:09.630
Hey. What do you got there?

10:09.670 --> 10:12.190
You kids got something underthose
robes you want to show me?

10:12.240 --> 10:15.720
Manny, you passed the cuts,

10:15.760 --> 10:17.630
so why aren't you
in a better mood?

10:19.550 --> 10:22.290
You bribed my dean to get mepast the
cut, didn't you?

10:22.330 --> 10:25.210
I would never do
something like that.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.430
Oh, bravo!

10:26.470 --> 10:28.430
If Lisa Wagner pulled outthat performance,

10:28.470 --> 10:30.450
maybe she wouldn't be
drivingback to her parents' house

10:30.470 --> 10:32.170
with a trunkfull of handmade puppets

10:32.210 --> 10:34.430
and a suddenlyvery uncertain future.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.570
I didn't bribe anyone. I don't know
why you're talking such crazy things.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.530
Because I saw you bribeSensei Ron.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.310
Wait.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.660
You bribed Sensei Ron?!

10:43.700 --> 10:45.180
So this is just a lie?!

10:45.230 --> 10:47.190
Are there others?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.540
Who the hell even am I?!

10:57.670 --> 10:59.110
Oh!

10:59.150 --> 11:00.290
Oops.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.460
Oh, my God!

11:05.860 --> 11:08.550
Nice try, kemosabes.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.600
Oh!

11:17.740 --> 11:20.090
Mm! Mm!

11:21.350 --> 11:23.220
Hey. Ash. I think
you left your program.

11:23.270 --> 11:25.140
Oh. Thank you.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.270
Wow, it's wild to think

11:26.310 --> 11:28.100
where all these kids
are gonna end up, right?

11:28.140 --> 11:30.270
I mean, there's
so many great schools.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.710
In fact, our...

11:31.750 --> 11:32.710
Oh.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.150
Is something wrong?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.470
Our daughter joined ISIS.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.150
Oh, God!

11:38.190 --> 11:41.070
The government said
she's not an American anymore.

11:41.110 --> 11:43.300
There's a van always
parked in front of our house.

11:43.330 --> 11:44.460
Oh, God. I'm so sorry...

11:44.500 --> 11:46.780
Did Claire tell
youour daughter's a genius?

11:47.850 --> 11:50.160
And so, graduates,
look to your left

11:50.210 --> 11:52.470
and to your right.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.250
It's a simple key chain with
a tiny cowboy hat charm on it.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.950
If you see it,
please pass it forward.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.300
All right, and now on to
our commencement speaker.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.040
He is a pillar of the community,

12:01.090 --> 12:04.650
an entrepreneur and closeteer... Mr.
Jay Pritchett.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.440
Commencement.

12:09.490 --> 12:11.360
"C" for "courage,."

12:11.400 --> 12:13.360
"O" for "opportunity,"

12:13.400 --> 12:14.530
the first "M"...

12:19.450 --> 12:20.970
Disaster had struck.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.280
But did I panic?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.500
No.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.940
No one chooses to be
a wartime principal.

12:25.980 --> 12:28.330
But we're the ones
history remembers.

12:28.370 --> 12:30.420
Pick one, they all said...

12:30.460 --> 12:32.510
Closets orblinds.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.420
Mitchell,
he's tanking my graduation.

12:35.470 --> 12:37.490
I'm cutting him off and moving
right to the in-memoriam section.

12:37.510 --> 12:39.340
Well, that wouldbe
less depressing.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.950
Yeah, the problem is, the band
just walked out in solidarity.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.560
Here. W-What?

12:43.610 --> 12:46.520
Mitchell, you can't have
an in memoriam without music.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.220
That's just a bummer.

12:48.260 --> 12:49.530
Take it! Oh.

12:49.570 --> 12:53.220
Hoot all you want,
but that Brylcreem kid was me!

12:53.270 --> 12:54.230
Yes, hi, thank you.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.330
Thank you, Jay Pritchett, everyone!

12:55.360 --> 12:57.100
Wow, I don't know about
you, but I feel like

12:57.140 --> 12:58.810
getting out thereand
taking on the world, huh?

12:58.840 --> 13:00.820
That's a... And
now, let's remember

13:00.840 --> 13:03.760
those Dolphins
we lost this year.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.720
Mitchell, play something. Play anything.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.460
Something with
the most gravitas.

13:09.070 --> 13:13.420
You know, for a person who
lasttouched a trumpet two years ago,

13:13.460 --> 13:14.990
I think I sounded pretty good.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.560
I'm done. I'm done.

13:27.610 --> 13:28.480
All right! Wow!

13:28.520 --> 13:31.180
That is a lot of deceased
for one year.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.350
We should probably have
the police check into that.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.530
And now, before, uh,
passing out diplomas,

13:35.570 --> 13:37.620
I would like
to make sort of a...

13:37.660 --> 13:40.750
A personal gesture
to this graduating class.

13:40.790 --> 13:44.060
As these balloons fill the sky,
know that each one of them

13:44.100 --> 13:48.150
represents a student
who has personally inspired me

13:48.190 --> 13:52.370
and filled me with hope
for a better tomorrow.

13:57.850 --> 13:58.850
What?

14:00.770 --> 14:03.030
Psst! Acting Principal!

14:03.080 --> 14:05.640
Protesters hacked intoour sprinkler system.

14:05.690 --> 14:06.800
It's set to go off
in five minutes.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.210
We have to postpone
the graduation.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.620
And miss my chance
of becoming principal?

14:09.650 --> 14:10.520
Not a chance!

14:10.560 --> 14:12.410
Well, no one can read400
names in five minutes.

14:12.430 --> 14:14.040
Oh, really?

14:14.090 --> 14:16.220
All that training,
all those parties missed,

14:16.260 --> 14:17.530
all those auctions attended

14:17.570 --> 14:19.440
were for this moment
right here, right now.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.440
Students, hi!
When you hear your name,

14:21.490 --> 14:24.660
please proceed to the stage
and grab your diploma.

14:24.710 --> 14:27.010
Nelly Abrishami, Allison
Acosta, Frieda Alafary,

14:27.060 --> 14:28.970
Scott "The Skunk" Albanese,
Jessica Alenick,

14:29.020 --> 14:31.670
Richard Thompson Allen,
Lavaria Aminu, Larry Annecone,

14:31.710 --> 14:33.590
Darla Arleto,
Daniel Dey Aronson...

14:33.630 --> 14:35.280
I was gonna make it!

14:35.330 --> 14:36.410
And then...

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
I hit the Polish names.

14:38.500 --> 14:41.770
Czeslaw Wlodaryzack-ck-kowsky.

14:41.810 --> 14:45.120
Wladyslaw Wlod...

14:45.160 --> 14:46.250
nisky? Yeah.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.600
Uh... Oh!

14:47.640 --> 14:48.920
Myra Zarinsky...

14:55.830 --> 14:58.310
Okay, if we steer clear of Dad
and Cam, we've got a chance

14:58.350 --> 14:59.630
of blending into the mob
when they turn violent.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.220
What the hell is this?

15:01.270 --> 15:02.680
Okay, well, apparently,
when those owls

15:02.700 --> 15:04.330
hacked into the sprinkler
system, it was school-wide.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.710
They're not letting anyone
into the parking structure.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.880
Oh, no!

15:07.920 --> 15:09.470
I hope this doesn't mean
we're gonna have to miss

15:09.490 --> 15:11.880
the secondgraduation of the day.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.580
How lucky is that?

15:15.630 --> 15:18.330
Me cruising by with an Uber
fareright when you called.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.810
So lucky. Very lucky. Very good.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.500
Well, this is you, Gerald.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.550
Let's have today be the day

15:26.600 --> 15:27.700
you stop playing for your dad

15:27.730 --> 15:29.730
and start playing for Gerald.

15:29.770 --> 15:31.250
That...
That kind of reminds me...

15:31.300 --> 15:33.120
I'm sorry I lied
about the trumpet lessons.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.580
Oh, please.
Not the worst part of my day.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.340
I'm realizing now that Principal
Brown set me up to fail.

15:37.390 --> 15:38.480
There wasno car crash,

15:38.520 --> 15:39.540
just like there was
no moon landing.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.520
Cam... Flags can't wave in space,
Mitchell.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.260
Hey, hey, hey, I was humiliated
much worse than you.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.400
It was so unfair.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.180
A lifetime of service
out the window.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.180
You think I don't see
the faces of owls

15:49.230 --> 15:52.100
every night I close my eyes?

15:52.140 --> 15:54.620
At least you've accomplishedsomething
they can tear down.

15:54.670 --> 15:55.490
I'm a fraud!

15:55.540 --> 15:57.150
You see what you did
to your brother?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.670
Look at those sad, hurt eyes.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.150
Like a sad little owl.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.350
Well, maybe if you believed in your sons

16:02.370 --> 16:04.720
instead of giving
everyoneColombian handshakes.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.550
What?!

16:05.590 --> 16:07.640
I've never sanded down
a man's fingers

16:07.680 --> 16:09.160
in front of his family!

16:10.330 --> 16:12.640
Oh, you mean the bribes?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.510
You can't deny it anymore.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.510
Look at this photoon my dean's Instagram.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.320
He's wearing the same
watchyou gave Sensei Ron.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.880
The superintendent
was wearing that same watch.

16:18.910 --> 16:20.890
I-I noticed it when he shook my
hand at the end of the ceremony

16:20.910 --> 16:22.690
and said I was
a "horrifying disgrace."

16:22.740 --> 16:24.520
You bribed him?!

16:24.570 --> 16:26.520
Is thathow I got my speech?

16:26.570 --> 16:27.870
Okay, enough!

16:27.920 --> 16:30.790
I'm sure you would have gotten
all these things on your own,

16:30.830 --> 16:34.750
but the world sometimes
is very unfair!

16:34.790 --> 16:37.010
And the watches
are like an insurance.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.800
Why do you even have so many?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.190
Sometimes I do a little bit
of Ambien shopping

16:41.230 --> 16:43.670
and I buy too much of one thing.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.670
Didn't you all wonder

16:44.720 --> 16:47.550
when you got the same fun socks
for Christmas?

16:47.590 --> 16:48.830
- Oh, samesies.
- I'll be damned!

16:48.850 --> 16:49.920
- I don't have those.
- They're fun!

16:49.940 --> 16:51.330
I'm sorry, okay?

16:51.380 --> 16:53.030
But I love you guys so much

16:53.070 --> 16:55.340
to leave your dreams to chance.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.340
I suppose where you grew up,

16:57.380 --> 16:58.970
bending the rules
was just a part of life.

16:58.990 --> 17:01.210
It's what you had to do
to get by.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.820
Why wouldn't you do that
to help the people you love?

17:03.870 --> 17:05.170
Thank you, Manny.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.710
You're not welcome.
That's not how I feel.

17:06.740 --> 17:07.800
I-It's a speech
from a play I was in.

17:07.829 --> 17:09.130
Right after that line,

17:09.180 --> 17:10.849
I light up a cigarette
and put my clothes back on.

17:10.869 --> 17:12.829
Yeah, I'm good, but...

17:12.880 --> 17:14.720
now I'll never knowif
that's why I made the cut.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.750
Okay, stop. Look.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.069
We've all had
a terrible day today...

17:17.099 --> 17:18.180
Not me.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.400
Tons of great fares,
amazing yoga class...

17:20.450 --> 17:22.839
I-I was building
to something, buddy.

17:22.890 --> 17:24.690
But that's one of the great
things about being in a family.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.210
We get to share
in each other's victories.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.849
And Alex has
a huge victory today

17:27.890 --> 17:29.240
that can make us
all feel better.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.500
So let's...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.720
turn around this crap day
with a nice, feel-good...

17:32.760 --> 17:34.200
Hey, is that Alex?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.640
Oh, my God. Pull over!

17:36.680 --> 17:38.250
Back up!

17:40.690 --> 17:43.210
Alex! Honey, what happened? Are you okay?

17:43.250 --> 17:44.730
What day is it?

17:44.780 --> 17:48.740
Not that time is anything
but a flat circle.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.610
So... we were done with classes,
done with finals,

17:51.650 --> 17:54.480
and, like college seniors
since the beginning of time,

17:54.530 --> 17:56.660
we decided to get a little nuts.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.700
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

17:58.750 --> 18:00.400
Our classmate Ashish Chug...

18:00.440 --> 18:01.530
I did it!

18:01.580 --> 18:03.750
Hacked his key card
to get us access

18:03.800 --> 18:05.970
to the restricted section
of the library.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.410
We decided to read
Alister's Last Theorem.

18:08.450 --> 18:12.890
Gottlob Alister wrote a proof
showing that zero equals 1.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.460
This rendered mathematics
meaningless

18:14.500 --> 18:15.810
and drove him insane.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.850
According to legend,
the same fate befalls anyone

18:18.900 --> 18:20.770
who reads and understands
the proof.

18:20.810 --> 18:22.550
Good God.

18:28.950 --> 18:30.690
If mathematics doesn't matter,

18:30.740 --> 18:32.300
then no one can be certain
of anything,

18:32.350 --> 18:33.670
and I've just wasted
the last four...

18:33.700 --> 18:35.700
No, 16 years of my life,

18:35.740 --> 18:37.920
and there's no point
in me graduating!

18:37.960 --> 18:39.790
Okay, I can tellthat you're very upset,

18:39.830 --> 18:41.790
and you're probablyreally
overtired from finals.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.710
But you are gonna regret itif
you don't go to graduation.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.840
Look, I promise... whatever
is bothering you,

18:46.880 --> 18:48.540
figure it outafter the ceremony...

18:48.580 --> 18:49.710
After?! Yes.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.150
"After" implies "before"!

18:51.190 --> 18:53.450
But if one minute agois the
same as zero minutes ago,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.330
then before is now
and now is after!

18:55.370 --> 18:57.590
Usually when I hear people
talking like this,

18:57.630 --> 18:59.130
we're walking through
a Taco Bell drive-through.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.720
Sweetie, half your life
is having your mind blown.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.290
I remember when I heard there
were more stars in the galaxy

19:04.330 --> 19:06.680
than grains of rice
in a box of Uncle Ben's.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.120
No, there are more galaxies

19:08.160 --> 19:10.250
than grains of sand
on all the world's beaches.

19:11.820 --> 19:13.740
Okay, I can't lose 'em both!

19:13.780 --> 19:15.170
I got this! Alex... Somebody?

19:15.210 --> 19:17.780
"I never knew true strength
until..."

19:17.830 --> 19:18.910
"I met a man with no feet."

19:18.960 --> 19:21.350
Wait. No.These cards are not in order.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.710
Wait. Nobody help her
right now...

19:22.740 --> 19:25.830
Alex, you're
a smart, confident girl.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.140
I know that you're gonna
makethe right decision.

19:28.180 --> 19:31.060
Did you just
put this watch on me?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.930
I have a problem.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.970
I say if Alex doesn't want
to go to her graduation,

19:35.020 --> 19:36.060
that's herdecision.

19:36.110 --> 19:37.150
Thank you, Luke.

19:37.190 --> 19:38.500
As long as you know

19:38.540 --> 19:40.940
that whatever's going on here
isn't about math.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.720
Yeah, I think maybe
you're afraid to leave school.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.380
What? Your whole life,

19:45.420 --> 19:48.290
you've always known exactly
what you're supposed to do...

19:48.330 --> 19:50.820
Study, get good grades, repeat.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.990
Now that's over, and it's scary.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.730
Kind of like if zero equalled 1.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.950
But lucky for you,
your dummy brother and sister

19:58.000 --> 19:59.650
have spent time
in the real world.

19:59.690 --> 20:02.610
And if wecan handle it,
you're gonna do just fine.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.000
You think?

20:05.050 --> 20:06.050
Trust us.

20:07.050 --> 20:08.960
Come on. Let's go
get you graduated.

20:10.050 --> 20:11.120
Oh, hold on.
That door gets jammed.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.640
I have to open it
from the inside.Okay.

20:12.660 --> 20:13.620
I got it!

20:13.660 --> 20:14.670
Hyah!

20:14.710 --> 20:16.580
Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhh!

20:16.620 --> 20:18.150
Legend Danner.

20:19.630 --> 20:22.020
I still can't get over
that commencement speech.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.370
Not a single laugh.

20:23.410 --> 20:25.760
I'll tell you oneelementhe
didn't discover... hilarium.

20:25.810 --> 20:26.760
Oh! Oh, oh!

20:26.810 --> 20:28.810
Alex Dunphy.

20:28.850 --> 20:30.380
Congratulations.

20:30.420 --> 20:31.860
Hey!

20:32.940 --> 20:35.380
We don't want to brag,
but, uh...

20:35.430 --> 20:37.470
Our kids did that.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.820
Yeah.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.870
Ay, no! No more watches!

20:47.920 --> 20:49.830
When did I order these ones?!

20:49.870 --> 20:50.870
Hey, Mom, guess what!

20:53.530 --> 20:54.790
What, Papi?

20:54.840 --> 20:56.790
My friend Carlygot cut from my program,

20:56.840 --> 20:59.450
and her dads fundedour
new costume department.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.840
I guess bribes don'twork.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.410
I got through on my own merit.

21:02.450 --> 21:03.850
Yay! That calls for a reward.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.020
What is this?

21:07.070 --> 21:09.890
Ay, Manny,
please don't tell Jay.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.370
Oatmeal raisin?

21:11.420 --> 21:12.940
You know what... a true artist

21:12.980 --> 21:15.290
doesn't close himself
off to new experiences,

21:15.330 --> 21:17.600
even vile, ill-leavened cookies.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.080
That's the path I have chosen,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.430
to experienceand observe everything

21:21.470 --> 21:23.210
in this beautiful pageant
we call life.

21:23.260 --> 21:25.650
Aah!
