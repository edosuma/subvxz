00:01.436 --> 00:03.394
You're teaming up with the guys fromGhosted.

00:03.438 --> 00:05.048
I could have died
in there!

00:05.092 --> 00:07.268
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.311 --> 00:08.834
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
And check out our other Fox programs--

00:10.358 --> 00:13.100
The Orville, Gotham, and
Lucifer.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.710
Remember me?

00:14.753 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:17.321 --> 00:20.020
♪

00:25.764 --> 00:29.290
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.292
For my next trick,
I'm going to need

00:31.335 --> 00:32.858
a member of the audience.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.122
If, uh, we have any...
Uh, yes, ma'am.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.867
Also, I think the sleight
of hand stuff

00:41.911 --> 00:43.869
doesn't play well
in an audience like that.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.741
That's...
That's an intimate trick.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.178
Well, I've seen
other magicians pull it off.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.484
-Yeah.

00:49.527 --> 00:53.183
And I enjoy doing it, so...

00:53.227 --> 00:55.577
That's-- That's all
that matters, right there.

00:58.319 --> 01:00.364
Also, it's just not
that remarkable

01:00.408 --> 01:04.542
because you have the time to
search the deck for the card.

01:04.586 --> 01:05.978
Now, if the card was
already on top...

01:06.022 --> 01:07.154
Okay, how would the card
be on top?

01:07.197 --> 01:08.938
Like, how-how would you
even do that?

01:08.981 --> 01:10.244
-I don't know.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.245
-No.
-Okay.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.768
I don't-- I'm not a magician.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.335
Yeah, well,
that's a harder trick.

01:14.378 --> 01:17.294
Well, maybe practice that one.
I'd be into that.

01:22.299 --> 01:26.260
The cape was
an interesting choice.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.305
♪

01:31.395 --> 01:34.485
So, do we have any idea
how they got access?

01:34.529 --> 01:37.271
Yeah, and why'd they use
hard wire?

01:37.314 --> 01:39.403
Seems a little old school--
good for home recording,

01:39.447 --> 01:41.013
but bad for government bugging.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.624
DAVEY: I don't want to jump
on a bandwagon here,

01:42.667 --> 01:45.148
but can we blame the Russians
for this?

01:45.192 --> 01:46.410
They do cheat in skating.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.151
Mm-hmm. Smarty-pants spies.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.022
Ha, it's, uh, smart pants.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.589
LINDA:
Smarty-pants.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.243
No, it's, uh, smart pants.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.157
I'm wearing some.
They're prewired

01:54.201 --> 01:55.376
to connect my phone to my socks.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.247
They count my steps.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.206
-LINDA: Oh, my God.
-LaFREY: Okay, look.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.991
Whoever bugged our office
was smart enough

02:02.034 --> 02:04.776
to use analog technology
to evade our scanners.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.517
MAX: What about the taco place?
I mean,

02:06.561 --> 02:07.736
that was the base
of their operation.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.390
Should we look there?

02:09.433 --> 02:10.565
LEROY:
The key to this is the tacos.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.828
Find the tacos,
find the bad guys.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.265
-Eat the tacos, job well done.
-LaFREY: I agree.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.441
Leroy and Max,
do a deep dive on this one.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.356
Chain of title,
who's behind it.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.403
Bird, Barry, Annie,
find prints,

02:22.446 --> 02:24.231
tire tracks, physical evidence.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.407
Ken, Davey, I want you
to go through our own

02:26.450 --> 02:28.235
surveillance footage and see
if there are any

02:28.278 --> 02:30.672
disruptions in the system,
anomalies.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.069
Looks like the whole team
is here.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.462
That's good.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.857
I'm Merv.
Merv Minette.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.425
And I'm Dr. Barry Shaw.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.123
-Merv Minette.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.429
Excuse me, who are you?

02:48.472 --> 02:49.473
Oh, have you not met?

02:49.517 --> 02:51.345
This is Merv Minette.
Ava LaFrey.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.913
Acting Assistant Deputy
Director.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.480
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know that

02:56.524 --> 02:58.221
we were having visitors today.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.919
Visitors? You telling me you
didn't know I was coming?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.660
Well, unbelievable.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.140
Um, just give me a couple
seconds to finish up here.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.446
MERV:
Of course.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.882
Let's see,
I want someone to review

03:06.925 --> 03:08.144
the entry logs

03:08.188 --> 03:09.841
from the past 12 months.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.235
Probably not necessary.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.890
LaFREY: Well, it-it could
yield something.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.588
Hmm. Best not to bother.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.329
Well, if we don't look through
the entry logs,

03:19.373 --> 03:20.896
then we have to go through
thousands of hours

03:20.939 --> 03:22.289
of footage, so...

03:22.332 --> 03:24.900
Well, maybe watch
none of it, then.

03:26.554 --> 03:29.165
Perhaps we should have
that chat now.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.037
Okay, everybody,
let's just break this here.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.430
You all have your
team assignments.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.519
Uh, but, uh, right now
just maybe

03:35.563 --> 03:37.434
put a pin in whatever
you're doing.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.053
Oh, my God, what was that?

03:48.097 --> 03:49.707
That's the feeling of having
your balls cut off.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.973
MAX:
Okay, that is definitely

03:55.017 --> 03:56.671
a person getting fired
right there.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.413
Certainly not the body language
of somebody being asked to prom.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.067
Oh, well, I have to disagree
with you on that one.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.505
MAX:
Ugh, I feel for her.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.985
I was fired in front of a packed
lecture hall at Stanford,

04:07.029 --> 04:08.900
carried away by security.

04:08.944 --> 04:13.427
I was crying, I was kicking...

04:13.470 --> 04:15.733
vomited, I peed.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.910
The foil on my yogurt came off,

04:18.954 --> 04:21.739
and the-the honey part, like,
got in my hair.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.088
It made me look crazy.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.568
That's what made you look crazy?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.527
Yeah.

04:26.570 --> 04:29.443
No, they can't fire her.
She's been here forever.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.314
-She wasn't a great boss.
-You're just saying that

04:31.358 --> 04:32.968
'cause she didn't let you go
to Burning Man.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.317
ANNIE: Oh, oh, here they come.
Okay, be cool.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.190
What'd you guys talk about?

04:39.366 --> 04:41.368
So, um...

04:41.411 --> 04:44.022
So, I am just gonna
say this once.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.460
Effective immediately,
I am taking over

04:46.503 --> 04:48.592
as director of this department.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.680
Captain LaFrey here
will be sta--

04:49.724 --> 04:53.380
Is that French Canadian

04:53.423 --> 04:55.207
I don't know.

04:55.251 --> 04:58.689
Uh, Ms. LaFrey has elected
to stay on

04:58.733 --> 05:00.343
in a different capacity.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.346
No less important, just...

05:03.390 --> 05:05.392
Sir, wh-what about
the investigation?

05:05.435 --> 05:07.568
Yeah, we've got our teams.
We're ready to move.

05:07.611 --> 05:08.699
Uh, we won't be doing
an investigation.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.484
ALL:
What?

05:10.527 --> 05:11.789
The FBI will handle it.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.356
I mean, they set up protocol,

05:13.400 --> 05:14.575
and I think, you know,
why not follow it?

05:14.618 --> 05:16.359
I think that we are
in a better position

05:16.403 --> 05:18.187
to handle this than the FBI.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.277
-Annie Carver.
-Yeah.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.627
Yeah, I worked under your father
for a brief period at DoD.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.542
A good man, your dad.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.284
You know, there's a rumor
that recently he--

05:28.328 --> 05:31.156
he-he made Jared Kushner wear
a dunce cap,

05:31.200 --> 05:34.246
and he convinced him that it was
an executive wizard's hat.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.554
Yeah...

05:37.598 --> 05:39.251
You know, I'm not gonna be
cleaning house.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.950
I'm just gonna take a breath,

05:41.993 --> 05:44.605
find out what's working,
what isn't working,

05:44.648 --> 05:46.607
and, you know,
do a little spot cleaning.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.218
Okay? You know, I have

05:49.261 --> 05:52.743
four more years-- to this day,
as a matter of fact--

05:52.787 --> 05:55.224
and then I am out.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.531
Uh, what do you mean
by four years to the day?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.184
Is today your birthday?

05:59.228 --> 06:02.362
It is. Okay.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.018
MAX:
Okay,

06:07.062 --> 06:08.106
why would someone say

06:08.150 --> 06:09.586
they're not going to clean house

06:09.630 --> 06:11.980
unless they were thinking
about cleaning house?

06:12.023 --> 06:13.634
Oh, he's cleaning house.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.463
Only question is,
are we old newspapers

06:16.506 --> 06:18.726
or a diaper full of boo

06:26.603 --> 06:29.214
No, I'm not gonna hold
for one more second.

06:29.258 --> 06:32.130
Does Director Romslo know
that it's me?

06:32.174 --> 06:35.046
Resigned or replaced?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.874
H

06:41.531 --> 06:44.665
We all need to be very careful.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.710
I guess we're gonna have
to get a birthday cake.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.495
Ooh, for Merv? Lovely.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.236
-Okay, it seems really unearned.
-No, I-I agree.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.500
Well, it's not like I want to
get one, but how can we not?

06:53.543 --> 06:56.459
Either everyone in the office
gets a cake on their birthday,

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
or no one does-- it's not like
we can pick and choose

06:58.505 --> 07:01.333
-whose birthday we want
to celebrate.
-I never got a cake.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.335
Well, you won't tell us
when your birthday is.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.946
That's for my protection.

07:04.989 --> 07:07.339
Okay, then just pick a day.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.819
-Just not today.
-I pick today.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.604
Mr. Max Jennifer.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.170
That's me.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.085
-Okay. Um...
-Yeah.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.479
Majored in astrophysics at MIT.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.481
-Yeah.
-PhD Caltech.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.613
Tenured at Stanford.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.875
It's-It's actually
a double major.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.398
Astrophysics and cinema studies.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.313
Well, I majored in eliminating

07:24.356 --> 07:27.142
the enemy in Vietnam.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.884
I guess you didn't need that
year abroad, then.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.281
Says here in this report

07:36.325 --> 07:39.676
that you have seen
an alien space craft.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.504
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.768
"It made a sound like...

07:44.812 --> 07:48.729
babah wabah gishminga."

07:48.772 --> 07:51.993
Yeah, no, uh, it was actually
more like a "buduguesh."

07:52.036 --> 07:54.386
You know? I know this is weird,
but you want to think

07:54.430 --> 07:56.563
about saying all of your vowels
as if they're consonants,

07:56.606 --> 07:58.739
if that makes sense.
"Buduguesh."

07:58.782 --> 08:00.349
:
Shut up, Max.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.743
MAX:
Buduguesh. Buduguesh.

08:02.786 --> 08:06.007
-Buduguesh! It--
-I think it's horse baloney.

08:06.050 --> 08:09.924
Science is slow and methodical.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.753
Yeah, I-- I agree.
I'm a scientist.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.799
Which is why I think we should
follow the evidence

08:15.843 --> 08:17.888
in this office bugging mystery.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.934
There is no investigation.

08:19.977 --> 08:23.677
Okay. I mean, we do know that
the taco stand

08:23.720 --> 08:25.026
is where it started--

08:25.069 --> 08:27.376
But it's been handled,
Mr. Jennifer.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.160
It's been handled.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.685
It's like watching a PETA video.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.165
MERV: I don't want to waste
taxpayers' money

08:34.209 --> 08:37.604
to fund your fantasies.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.041
You know, not for aliens.

08:40.084 --> 08:44.698
Not for parallel universes.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.918
And certainly not for...

08:50.530 --> 08:53.054
You know, I feel like
you're not even trying

08:53.097 --> 08:54.446
to get that sound right.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.902
I went to Burning Man, you know.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.646
-BARRY: Inhale.
-MERV: Oh, God!

09:19.689 --> 09:21.604
Oh, my God!

09:21.648 --> 09:23.954
-MERV: Get--
Get that out of here!
-Yeah.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.043
:
Hey. You find anything?

09:26.087 --> 09:30.657
Um, not on the taco place,
but check this out.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.702
We find out that
this place is bugged...

09:32.746 --> 09:33.790
-...but then the next day...

09:33.834 --> 09:35.792
Ava calls it in to investigate.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.446
The next day she's fired.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.014
That's right.
And then Romslo was fired.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.798
Then she's fired,
we get a brand-new boss

09:41.842 --> 09:43.626
telling us not to investigate.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.020
Yeah, not to investigate this
massive security breach.

09:46.063 --> 09:50.285
Plus he is a total penis
and a giant douche.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.810
"XOXO"?

09:53.854 --> 09:55.682
-Yeah.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.901
Definitely on the high end
of friendly.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.512
-Okay, let me do it again.
-No. You can't cross it out.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.732
-I'm not getting another card.
-Give it to me.
-MAX: No.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.778
Stop it.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.432
ANNIE: Uh, usually people sign
the inside of a card.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.914
I know, but this way,
he takes the card home,

10:10.958 --> 10:15.353
shows it to his wife,
sees my name, big and bold.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.878
-Man.
-Listen...

10:17.921 --> 10:19.880
MERV:
Leroy.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.621
Come on.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.322
Can I have a card, too?
I've never gotten one.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.672
I'll get you a card, too.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.282
Thank you.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.067
Hmm.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.725
You don't play games, do you?

10:38.768 --> 10:41.075
You just lay it right out there.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.946
I lay it out,
spray a little water on it.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.252
Iron it, hang it up.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.906
When it's time, put it on,
go to work.

10:45.949 --> 10:50.040
-No games.
Indeed.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.476
You know, let me ask you
a question.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.958
How does a-a decorated
LAPD detective

10:55.002 --> 10:57.265
wind up at a secret
underground agency,

10:57.308 --> 10:59.615
chasing ghosts and goblins?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.749
Well...

11:02.792 --> 11:04.315
...at least I'm not running it.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.840
Yeah.
Yeah, would you like to?

11:08.624 --> 11:09.930
LEROY :
No, that's you.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.715
Yeah, well...

11:17.154 --> 11:18.982
How well do you know
these people?

11:19.026 --> 11:20.767
Well, I've only been here
for, like, six months,

11:20.810 --> 11:22.943
but everybody seems
pretty solid.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.163
Bird is an odd dude,
but, you know, L.A.

11:28.949 --> 11:31.386
Yeah, I-I just need
to know who I can trust.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.953
-You got to know your team.
-That's right.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.869
That's what my dad said.
He's a cop, too.

11:35.912 --> 11:36.739
-Yeah.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.785
-30 years.
-Ooh.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.266
When I go in, I'm gonna do it
like Leroy and not you.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.531
-Well, thank you for coming in.
-Yeah.

11:46.575 --> 11:47.750
Good chat.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
LEROY:
Hey, welcome again.

11:49.796 --> 11:50.840
MERV:
I could use that kind of...

11:50.884 --> 11:52.407
that kind of thinking.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.974
LEROY:
Right on.

11:54.017 --> 11:54.975
I'll be right up there.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.193
I'll be right here.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.542
: Okay.
-All right.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.022
-Take it easy.
-Yeah, you, too.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.633
Hey, Sleepy.

12:10.947 --> 12:15.038
So... Merv.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.997
-Yep.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.784
Got him laughing.
That was a good move.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.917
Strategic.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.788
And that handshake.

12:25.832 --> 12:29.705
Man, that was, like, from
the end of a movie or something,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.446
a movie about handshaking.

12:31.489 --> 12:35.929
Max, we had different meetings.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.669
I don't know, maybe it was
time of day.

12:37.713 --> 12:40.281
People like me. I have a
quality. I can't shut it off.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.152
I shut mine off.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.807
And by the way, that quality
of yours doesn't work on me.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.940
Don't be like that.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.509
Uh, all right. Sorry.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.600
Oh, uh, here. Check this out.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.820
Found the end of the line
on those shell corporations.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.736
One of them has a P.O. box.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.999
-That's not far from here.
-I feel like whoever's box
that is,

13:03.043 --> 13:05.393
they must know something
about who bugged this office,

13:05.436 --> 13:07.525
so maybe
we stake it out tonight.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.440
He was pretty damn clear.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.920
That investigation is over.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.968
Well, yeah, of course.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.839
He... he's wrong.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.667
Maybe, but he's the boss.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.669
The boss gets to be wrong.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.541
The boss sets the agenda.
The boss fires people.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.456
Come on, he's just
a tired, old bureaucrat.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.067
He's not gonna actually fire...

13:27.110 --> 13:28.546
BOB: No, you go to hell!
All right?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.548
17 years here!

13:31.898 --> 13:33.421
I don't believe these people.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.684
Well, I guess that's it,
everyone.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.077
Know what? Nice knowing you.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.948
I'm Bob, by the way.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.081
Not Rob, Bob.

13:51.482 --> 13:54.007
Those look like
stakeout PB and Js.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.747
Yeah. Maybe.

13:55.791 --> 13:59.012
Or maybe I just need to carb up
before ice skating.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.666
LEROY:
Don't do this, Max.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.842
It's stupid.

14:04.147 --> 14:07.150
Is that what Merv said or...

14:07.194 --> 14:08.935
You know, you're just making
this easier for me, actually.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.154
-Thanks for the help.
-Good. Good. I'm glad to help.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.156
Actually making it
even more fun.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.376
-Well, well, good.
-And I love making PB and Js,

14:15.419 --> 14:18.945
-but this is making it
extra special.
-Mm-hmm, glad to make it fun.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.598
-Mm-mm.

14:20.642 --> 14:21.904
You want some?
-Hmm. Not at all.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.297
-Nope.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.299
I do. I do. I do.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.867
Disgusting.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.132
ANNIE:
Mr. Minette?

14:32.175 --> 14:33.611
Marv.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.135
Marv or Merv?

14:35.178 --> 14:37.093
Merv.

14:38.138 --> 14:41.054
Uh, I just wanted to say,

14:41.097 --> 14:42.751
um, in light of my father...

14:42.794 --> 14:45.536
uh, look, I don't want any sort
of special treatment.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.149
I just want to support you
in any way that I can

14:49.192 --> 14:52.108
and if that means
changing up the staff,

14:52.152 --> 14:53.980
then I understand.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.025
Frankly, I was a little unnerved

14:56.069 --> 14:58.375
that the daughter of such
a high-ranking official

14:58.419 --> 15:00.943
-was gonna be watching
everything I do, so...
-Oh.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.380
I thank you
for your understanding

15:03.424 --> 15:05.948
and yes,
I will take you up on that.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.865
On what?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.476
Your offer to resign. I accept.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.958
Uh...

15:16.002 --> 15:18.395
uh, don't you want to see
how it goes first?

15:18.439 --> 15:21.094
No. No, if there's
a trial period,

15:21.137 --> 15:23.661
then it becomes a, you know,
a personal thing.

15:23.705 --> 15:27.622
Oh. Okay.

15:27.665 --> 15:32.453
Um... well,
I'm really happy here.

15:34.411 --> 15:38.198
And I know that my father

15:38.241 --> 15:40.940
is very proud of his baby girl.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.685
In fact, he was even bragging
about me at the White House.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.691
So, we'll see how it goes?

15:56.738 --> 15:59.262
Great. Great.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.699
A little gift.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.788
He gave you that?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.877
He likes the overhead better.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.490
You know, I can't even confirm
that his badge

16:09.533 --> 16:11.361
is authentic.
I can't help but wonder

16:11.405 --> 16:13.363
-if I shouldn't detain him
pending confirmation.
-Ava.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.191
-You know, Davey would help me
and so would Sasha.
-Ava. Ava.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.192
-Well, Sasha wouldn't help me.
-Stop, stop. Ava, Ava, Ava.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.280
!
-Hey, listen.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.021
You need to grab hold
of your brain

16:19.065 --> 16:20.892
and give it a good scrub-a-dub.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.243
You messed up, you got demoted.
It happens.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.288
None of that's Merv's fault.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.421
Now take your cleaned-up brain

16:27.464 --> 16:30.032
and write a new chapter
for yourself.
