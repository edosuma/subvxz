[eerie piano music playing]

00:23.291 --> 00:24.750
[footsteps echoing]

00:27.041 --> 00:28.833
[man] I don't know who I am.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.083
Not just a story of who I am,
but who I really am.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.041
[inhales]

00:37.375 --> 00:38.416
[exhales]

00:38.833 --> 00:41.125
The real... me.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.208
[chair dragging]

00:46.541 --> 00:48.541
[breathes deeply]

00:49.083 --> 00:50.750
I've been silent for 20 years.

00:52.958 --> 00:54.333
Twenty years!

00:55.583 --> 00:56.541
Of hiding.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.333
I should have stood by him,
I should have helped him.

00:59.416 --> 01:01.791
We should have done everything together,
as twins.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.541
We're identical twins. Bonded.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.791
And this thing was so strong
that it broke us off.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.250
It broke us apart.

01:08.541 --> 01:09.875
[breathes deeply]

01:10.458 --> 01:13.375
[man 2] The secrets I need answers to
are in Marcus's head.

01:14.791 --> 01:16.333
But they're deep in his head.

01:17.833 --> 01:19.833
So it would almost seem

01:19.916 --> 01:20.958
reckless

01:21.750 --> 01:25.291
in terms of whatever we're gonna find
when we open the box.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.500
It's Pandora's box.
You either open it or you don't.

01:30.416 --> 01:31.583
But... [exhales]

01:32.416 --> 01:35.083
will it help me? It's a chance.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.500
It's a chance I'm prepared to take.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.583
[engines revving]

01:44.833 --> 01:46.125
-[glass shatters]
-[tire squealing]

01:46.208 --> 01:49.541
[loud bang, motorcycle screeches]

01:57.083 --> 01:59.166
[music fades out]

02:03.000 --> 02:05.500
[hospital machine high pitched ringing]

02:07.833 --> 02:10.000
[heart rate whooshing]

02:12.666 --> 02:13.791
[man 2] I-- I woke up.

02:16.166 --> 02:18.041
I remember opening my eyes

02:18.375 --> 02:20.041
and looking around the room,

02:21.041 --> 02:23.916
trying to take in where I am.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
[slurping]

02:32.791 --> 02:36.666
I then turned my attention
to my twin brother,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.333
who I instantly recognized.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.750
[Marcus's muffled voice] Alex, it's me!

02:41.875 --> 02:44.250
[Alex] He was sitting on the bed
next to me...

02:44.375 --> 02:45.583
[Marcus] It's okay.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.500
[Alex] ...and I just said,

02:47.583 --> 02:48.708
"Hello, Marcus."

02:50.125 --> 02:54.458
I guess the major thing about being a twin
is that you're never alone.

02:55.791 --> 02:58.083
And it's a massive thing to have.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.333
So whatever happens to you in your life,

03:01.833 --> 03:04.375
you've always got your other half there.

03:06.666 --> 03:07.750
[Alex] Even though

03:07.833 --> 03:10.541
I wasn't sure
of what was going on around me,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.583
I knew 100% that he was my brother
and I could trust him.

03:18.375 --> 03:21.458
I then turned my attention to a lady

03:22.541 --> 03:24.625
much closer to the bed
than everybody else...

03:26.958 --> 03:29.875
and she was getting quite hysterical

03:30.583 --> 03:32.708
at the fact that I had woken up.

03:32.791 --> 03:35.541
"Hello, hello, Ali, you're awake.
You're awake. How are you?

03:35.625 --> 03:36.833
It's me, it's me."

03:37.875 --> 03:40.416
And I'm thinking,
"I don't know how I am.

03:40.666 --> 03:42.250
And I don't know who you are."

03:42.333 --> 03:44.291
"You remember me. You remember me.
Don't you remember me?

03:44.375 --> 03:46.041
You must remember me,
you must remember me!"

03:46.125 --> 03:48.583
-And kept repeating and repeating this.
-[high pitched ringing]

03:49.500 --> 03:51.708
I said to Marcus, "Who is she?"

03:53.333 --> 03:54.333
And he just said...

03:55.416 --> 03:56.458
"She is our mother."

04:00.541 --> 04:01.500
And Marcus said to me,

04:01.583 --> 04:04.125
"Do you really not know
that that is our mother?"

04:05.500 --> 04:06.583
And I said, "No."

04:08.541 --> 04:11.541
And then he said to me,
"Well, do you know who you are?

04:13.416 --> 04:14.541
And what's your name?"

04:18.041 --> 04:21.083
And it started to dawn on me
that I really didn't know anything.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.000
-[blades whirring]
-I didn't know where I was.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.000
Where do I live.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.916
I didn't know what happened to me.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.708
I didn't even know my own name.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.875
[heart rate beep speeding up]

04:34.041 --> 04:35.500
Everything had gone.

04:35.916 --> 04:37.416
[high pitched ringing]

04:38.541 --> 04:40.166
[ringing fades out]

04:42.333 --> 04:44.333
[eerie music playing]

04:46.291 --> 04:49.000
[Marcus] Imagine a black empty space.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.708
You've lost everything in your life...

04:55.125 --> 04:57.458
and you start from a blank canvas.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.625
Imagine how scary that would be.

05:06.916 --> 05:11.666
The doctor explained that he had
been wearing a helmet that had come off

05:12.041 --> 05:14.125
and, therefore, when he hit the ground,

05:14.583 --> 05:16.875
he hit the ground with his head
and not with his helmet.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.791
And that had induced him
to go into a coma.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.541
And they weren't sure

05:24.000 --> 05:26.666
what kind of brain damage
that would leave him with.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.458
[car engine running]

05:33.583 --> 05:36.125
[Alex] My mother came to pick me up.

05:37.708 --> 05:41.125
She said, probably three or four times
before we even got in the car,

05:41.208 --> 05:46.208
"You do remember who I am, don't you?"
And I'm like, "No, I don't."

05:46.958 --> 05:48.958
[soft piano music playing]

05:50.250 --> 05:52.875
I said, "Where are we going?"
She said, "We're going home.

05:52.958 --> 05:54.916
I'm taking you home, back to our home."

05:58.458 --> 06:01.541
So I'm sitting in a car
with a total stranger,

06:01.666 --> 06:04.208
driving somewhere.
I've no idea where I'm going.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.291
[inhales]

06:05.375 --> 06:09.000
I'm being told, "This is your house.
This is where you live."

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
[tires moving over gravel]

06:16.916 --> 06:20.666
It's got a gravel drive.
It's quite a large gravel drive.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.875
It's quite a big house,

06:24.541 --> 06:27.166
which looked quite daunting to me.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.833
[Marcus] He was in a haze.
He didn't know where he was.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.708
He didn't know anything.

06:37.666 --> 06:40.541
Even though he was 18,

06:41.333 --> 06:44.250
he had the mental age
of a... [inhales] nine-year-old.

06:45.791 --> 06:49.791
I remember walking through the kitchen
and explaining, "This is the kitchen,"

06:49.875 --> 06:52.666
and then the bathroom
and then taking him into the...

06:53.250 --> 06:54.333
into his bedroom.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.625
"This is your bed on the left,
and my bed's on the right."

07:04.791 --> 07:06.125
[Alex] I'm just being told

07:06.875 --> 07:08.208
that "This is your house.

07:09.208 --> 07:10.208
This is your mother."

07:11.791 --> 07:12.958
I don't know that.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.291
My head was just blank.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.625
I mean, for everybody else,

07:29.708 --> 07:32.291
they're going to remember
being on holidays,

07:32.416 --> 07:35.000
they're going to remember
falling off their bike for the first time,

07:35.083 --> 07:37.166
their first kiss,
the first time they were in love.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.583
Those are the things
that really make up who you are.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.833
And you actually need those memories.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.458
I'm coming at this with nothing.

07:51.583 --> 07:54.250
-[loud bang]
-[silverware rattling]

07:58.000 --> 07:59.291
[dog moans]

08:01.125 --> 08:02.458
[Alex] It was quite apparent...

08:02.541 --> 08:03.375
[chewing]

08:03.458 --> 08:07.333
...that my parents didn't know
how to deal with me.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.916
[exhales]

08:11.958 --> 08:14.250
My father, I didn't-- He was so distant.

08:15.416 --> 08:17.041
He didn't hug me or anything like that.

08:17.125 --> 08:20.416
He just shook my hand
and said he was my father.

08:22.583 --> 08:23.750
He never came to the hospital.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.041
No.

08:26.916 --> 08:28.208
He never-- He never came.

08:34.332 --> 08:37.541
My mother didn't want to believe

08:37.957 --> 08:39.207
I had lost my memory.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.457
It was... just, for her, unthinkable.

08:44.666 --> 08:48.291
For a son not to know
who their mother was.

08:50.541 --> 08:51.958
And she didn't want to believe it.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.625
[Marcus] Can you imagine,

08:55.333 --> 08:59.208
your son wakes up
and he's no idea who you are.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.375
[deep breath]

09:00.833 --> 09:03.833
Any mother would be deeply distressed.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.708
It really hurt her a lot.

09:10.875 --> 09:15.916
[Alex] So I'm totally on my own,
in that house with no support

09:16.000 --> 09:17.333
apart from my brother.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.541
He gets it. He understands.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.458
I don't have to explain anything to him.

09:23.875 --> 09:27.458
He doesn't make it difficult for me.
He gives me everything I need.

09:28.041 --> 09:31.208
If he hadn't known who I was,
and he hadn't known his twin,

09:31.666 --> 09:35.250
then he would have been all alone
in the world for the rest of his life.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.375
But he wasn't alone in the world.
He had me.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.875
-[lively piano music playing]
-[door hinge squeaks]

09:42.333 --> 09:43.791
[Alex] There was so much to learn.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.625
So very quickly he gave me
the basic information,

09:47.708 --> 09:52.666
the everyday, "This is kitchen.
This is TV. This is a table."

09:53.583 --> 09:56.041
[Marcus] I had to show him
where all his clothes are,

09:56.125 --> 10:00.250
how to put his shoes on,
tie his shoelaces up, make toast.

10:00.708 --> 10:02.500
He just kept giving me stuff.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.875
And I just went along with everything.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.375
[water running from faucet]

10:08.125 --> 10:09.791
When he said he didn't know something,

10:10.333 --> 10:11.875
I just told him what it was.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.541
Then starting to get
into more difficult things

10:15.625 --> 10:17.375
like, "Wow, what is that thing?"

10:19.875 --> 10:22.083
The first few minutes was a bit strange,

10:22.958 --> 10:25.041
and then I realized
I could actually do that.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.166
That I could ride a bike.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.875
That was something that he was actually
quite good at, I seem to remember.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.708
But he didn't know
where he was going, of course.

10:33.791 --> 10:36.583
So we would go out of the house
and then everything was a blank.

10:36.666 --> 10:38.083
-[grunts]
-[clatter and bang]

10:38.166 --> 10:40.416
[laughs]

10:51.000 --> 10:52.416
[Alex] The world seemed very scary.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.458
But with him...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.750
everything was a little bit easier.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.583
[music from TV]

11:01.666 --> 11:04.041
[cartoon from TV] Ladies and gentlemen!

11:04.166 --> 11:06.250
[Alex] TV was an eye-opener for me.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.208
All the shows were new,
even down to Tom and Jerry.

11:10.291 --> 11:13.500
[Tom and Jerry theme playing on TV]

11:14.291 --> 11:17.250
In one way, I'm trying to learn
as much information as possible.

11:17.666 --> 11:22.041
And in the second way,
I'm trying to work my family out

11:22.375 --> 11:24.291
and the dynamics that are going on.

11:26.125 --> 11:30.291
And there'd be like a perfect Sunday lunch
with everybody sitting around the table

11:30.458 --> 11:33.000
for Oxo Cube, and it looked nice.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.375
And I just imagined

11:35.458 --> 11:38.416
that must just be how all families are
'cause I saw it on the telly.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.458
[laughs]

11:41.916 --> 11:43.916
[uplifting instrumental music playing]

11:45.875 --> 11:49.208
I soon realized that Mommy
was at the center of my new world.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.166
She was quite a tall woman.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.500
She was over six foot,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.541
and she had quite large hands
and very large feet.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.375
Overly large feet.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.041
She was great fun.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.750
She'd just sort of dance
around the kitchen.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.083
She would come in a room and say,
"And here we all are.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.500
I'm here, everybody, I'm here."

12:10.125 --> 12:12.375
She'd be, [impersonates Mom]
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

12:12.458 --> 12:13.625
She'd be laughing like that.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.583
Louder than loud, really.

12:16.916 --> 12:18.041
[dog moans]

12:18.750 --> 12:21.041
[Alex] Mom inherited
a bunch of Chihuahuas.

12:22.291 --> 12:23.916
And she used to dress them up.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.000
They'd have their own clothes,
little hats,

12:27.291 --> 12:30.208
little coats,
and, um... that was her world.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.625
Before the accident,
we both hated these dogs.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.916
-We used to call them rats on legs.
-[dog moaning]

12:36.166 --> 12:39.333
But Alex, when he came home,
he rather liked the Chihuahuas.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.458
I quite liked them,

12:40.541 --> 12:43.041
'cause I thought they were quite sweet,
I'd never seen one before,

12:43.250 --> 12:45.875
whereas nobody else
had any interest in the dogs at all.

12:45.958 --> 12:46.958
[laughs]

12:47.041 --> 12:49.250
I still can't stand them.
Horrible little things.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.791
[laughs]

12:50.875 --> 12:52.458
[music fades out]

12:55.458 --> 13:00.500
So I've grown up incredibly quickly
in the space of a month,

13:01.250 --> 13:04.916
from probably a six-year-old
to sort of a... to a early teenager,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.958
sort of 14, 15 already, in such speed

13:08.541 --> 13:11.000
that now I need to move to another level.

13:12.125 --> 13:17.291
And that's when I start asking Marcus
more personal questions.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.041
Who, who am I really?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.333
[clicks]

13:23.875 --> 13:26.916
So I started to ask Marcus
about our childhood.

13:27.833 --> 13:31.291
He would say, you know,
"What family holidays did we go on?"

13:31.375 --> 13:32.333
[clicks]

13:32.416 --> 13:34.541
And I'd say, "Oh, you know,
we would go to France

13:34.625 --> 13:36.083
-on a beach holiday."
-[clicks]

13:36.291 --> 13:38.666
"Oh, right, was that nice?"
"Oh, yeah, it was great, you know.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.750
We used to go to the beach,
we'd have an ice cream.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.416
You always liked to have a chocolate flake
in your ice cream."

13:44.166 --> 13:45.541
"Oh, right, that's nice."

13:45.625 --> 13:46.458
[clicks]

13:46.541 --> 13:48.541
[soft piano music playing]

13:49.500 --> 13:53.083
[Alex] Marcus showed me a photograph
of the two of us on holiday,

13:53.416 --> 13:55.541
and it looked nice. And we were, you know,

13:56.083 --> 13:59.125
typical boys building
sand castles on a beach.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.083
So I just presumed
that's what we did every year.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.583
He showed me photographs.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.541
And I joined the dots.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.125
[waves crashing on the beach]

14:17.916 --> 14:19.333
[Alex] He would give me a photo...

14:20.708 --> 14:23.375
and I would construct a memory around that

14:24.208 --> 14:26.916
of two happy boys on a beach.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.041
[Marcus] What I was doing was actually

14:32.333 --> 14:35.500
reimplanting his memory
and giving him... [inhales]

14:35.583 --> 14:36.666
his childhood back

14:36.791 --> 14:41.416
and answering questions from
the very beginning of when he was a baby

14:41.500 --> 14:42.791
up to 18.

14:43.875 --> 14:47.166
[Alex] When you've got no memory,
and you get little bits of information,

14:47.791 --> 14:50.750
then just some information
about a single holiday

14:50.875 --> 14:54.375
meant an enormous amount to me
'cause that's all I had.

14:55.833 --> 14:58.208
So these tiny little fragments

14:58.291 --> 15:00.500
became the building blocks
for my new sense of self.

15:02.125 --> 15:05.166
-And life seemed good.
-[kids talking and shouting]

15:05.333 --> 15:08.958
The life that Marcus showed me
that I had and painted for me

15:09.041 --> 15:13.500
was that we were a fairly
privileged family in the home counties

15:14.291 --> 15:16.041
with perfectly normal parents.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
You know, dinner parties around the house
and everything looked good.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.083
He painted an idyllic picture.

15:26.958 --> 15:28.958

[music fades out]

15:34.833 --> 15:36.833
[clock ticking]

15:39.166 --> 15:42.916
[Marcus] Learning the rules of the house
was more complicated.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.416
We weren't allowed to go upstairs.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.333
We didn't eat with our parents.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.583
We weren't allowed a front door key.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.458
And, from the age of...

15:54.708 --> 15:57.500
[huffs] I think... 14,

15:58.333 --> 16:01.000
we lived out in the shed in the garden.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.000
[inhales]

16:02.416 --> 16:04.875
In a funny sort of way
we quite liked living in the shed

16:05.125 --> 16:07.166
because it was our domain.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.333
Yeah, it was-- it was, um...

16:11.416 --> 16:13.541
it was a confusing house for me.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.833
[clock striking the hour]

16:22.333 --> 16:24.333
There was just ornaments everywhere.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.625
Every cupboard was full,
every outhouse was full,

16:27.708 --> 16:30.041
every loft was full,
every garage was full.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.875
And there were sections of the house
that you weren't allowed to be in,

16:34.041 --> 16:36.208
and you didn't enter without permission.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.583
Especially my father's side.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.250
[ominous instrumental music playing]

16:40.333 --> 16:42.916
You wouldn't enter his study
unless you were summoned.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
[clock ticking]

16:45.833 --> 16:49.375
He was quite a scary guy,
and he had a hell of a temper on him.

16:49.916 --> 16:54.000
He would shout very loudly, and bang!
He would just thump the table

16:54.083 --> 16:56.916
on the dining room... I remember
particularly on the dining room table.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.416
There was a really long,
huge dining room table, you know,

17:00.500 --> 17:03.000
in the center of the house,
and he would whack that.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.000
And then he would just dismiss you.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.750
Marcus just instructed me,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.665
"Don't get involved.
Just let him do his thing.

17:16.540 --> 17:20.165
And be polite.
Always be polite and call him sir."

17:22.250 --> 17:25.250
[Marcus] I do remember him kept asking me
why did we have to do that.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.333
And I just said, "Because that's...

17:27.415 --> 17:29.666

That's what you do in a family."

[lively music playing]

17:33.416 --> 17:36.000

informed me that our parents

came from an aristocratic background.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.041
I never thought, "This is odd,"

18:09.083 --> 18:12.083
It was perfectly normal to live in a shed.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.000
So I was never questioning anything.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.291
Because what is normal, really?

18:18.208 --> 18:21.708
Normal is what you know.
And normal is what your family is.

And I took it as my own,

[indistinct greetings]

19:08.375 --> 19:10.208

You don't want to stick out,
you just want to be the same.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.583
apart from Marcus.

20:07.500 --> 20:12.666
So, me and Marcus together
built up a system

20:12.791 --> 20:15.000
where I could meet people

20:15.083 --> 20:17.875
without them ever realizing
that I didn't have a clue who they were.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.125
[fun instrumental music playing]

20:20.625 --> 20:22.625
[Marcus] We would go
to a friend's house for dinner.

We would stand outside the door
and he'd say, "Right, okay, remind me."

20:27.083 --> 20:29.416
[stuttering] Give me the names again.
What do they look like?

20:29.500 --> 20:33.416
Just give me the quick little outline,
so a tiny little synopsis of each person.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.041
This is Dave, this is John, this is Chris.
And then they'd open the door,

20:37.125 --> 20:39.291
"Oh, hi. Really nice to see you."

20:39.375 --> 20:40.916
And people never knew.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.500

"Ah, Alex is fine, look.

He knows everybody here.
He knows what's going on."

20:47.333 --> 20:48.583

But then he said,
"Oh, yes, and you have a girlfriend."

I thought,
"Oh, I've got a girlfriend, have I?"

20:57.333 --> 21:01.208
She, um... she was very nice.
And she didn't really notice

that he would lose his new memory.

behavior and the things that he'd done.

before he died?

out of the room with him

I said, "Because he asked us.

He asked us to forgive him.
Why could you not do that?"

I thought things in the house
would change,

23:41.625 --> 23:43.958
because he was the bully,
he made the rules up.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.625
So, when I got into my twenties,

23:48.625 --> 23:52.166
I thought we can have access to our house,
we could have keys to our house,

23:52.250 --> 23:55.791
we can go in and eat food whenever
we want. Turn up whenever we want.

23:55.916 --> 23:58.583
All those rules have gone
out of the window. He's gone now.

It was very quickly apparent
that the rules hadn't changed.

24:05.916 --> 24:07.666
They became even more stringent.

24:12.541 --> 24:15.500
Mom still didn't want us to have a key.

24:19.458 --> 24:23.333
But I asked Marcus about it,
and he just told me not to worry.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.208
So I didn't.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.000
And I jump five years later,

24:43.083 --> 24:46.375

of the stairs, unconscious.

[Alex] I found the whole thing
very upsetting.

25:03.541 --> 25:05.291
I did grow to love my mother.

25:07.375 --> 25:11.291
And, you know,
and become very close to her.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.125
She said that she would miss us,

27:25.500 --> 27:28.333
Marcus and I looked in it.
I was really, really shocked.

27:29.666 --> 27:32.791
But he didn't really show much emotion,

27:33.208 --> 27:34.875
just kept reassuring me,

27:34.958 --> 27:37.833
"Never mind about that,
put it to one side. Let's get on."

27:38.416 --> 27:39.625
[door opens]

27:41.833 --> 27:43.416
And when we got into the attic,

27:44.041 --> 27:46.875
there was our childhood.

27:50.250 --> 27:55.250
All our school books,
all our baby clothes.

27:56.666 --> 27:59.708
And then boxes and boxes of presents

28:00.333 --> 28:03.666
that have been given to us
for every Christmas and every birthday

28:04.083 --> 28:08.375
from our godfathers, aunts, uncles.

28:09.750 --> 28:14.583
We spent every birthday and Christmas
with no presents from anybody.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.583
She kept every single one.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.166
It made my mother much more complicated.

28:27.708 --> 28:31.458
Who was this lady?
What do I not know about her?

28:36.375 --> 28:39.291
And we started clearing Mommy's room.

28:45.416 --> 28:46.875
[sliding door opening]

28:48.125 --> 28:50.416
We were in the back of a cupboard,

28:50.875 --> 28:54.666
and you get through all these
tons and tons of coats and clothes,

28:55.166 --> 29:00.041
and at the back you find a secret door
to a cupboard within a cupboard.

29:00.583 --> 29:04.208
Of course, it's locked.
So we have to find a key.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.708
[clattering]

29:19.541 --> 29:24.000
And inside there is a photograph

29:24.958 --> 29:26.500
of me and Marcus,

29:28.125 --> 29:31.583
aged around ten, and we're naked

29:32.750 --> 29:34.125
with our heads cut off.

29:37.791 --> 29:42.333
[tearfully] It was too weird.
It was just too, too strange.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.916
What the hell was she doing

29:45.625 --> 29:49.916
with a naked picture of me and Marcus
with our heads cut off?

29:56.083 --> 29:57.500
I just didn't know what to do.

29:58.416 --> 29:59.250
I...

30:00.208 --> 30:02.916
-didn't know what to do. [sighs]
-[music fades out]

30:04.750 --> 30:06.291
[fire crackling]

30:24.208 --> 30:25.666
[breathes deeply]

30:27.041 --> 30:27.875
No.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.291
[sniffles]

30:30.833 --> 30:31.791
[sobbing] Fucking mad.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.333
I'm too fucking mad.

30:36.916 --> 30:37.750
[gulps]

30:37.833 --> 30:39.125
[sighs] Jesus.

30:40.041 --> 30:40.875
[scoffs]

30:51.333 --> 30:53.750
[gulps] Can I have a cup of tea?

31:03.750 --> 31:05.750
[melancholic music playing]

31:08.000 --> 31:10.291
[tires moving over gravel]

31:21.541 --> 31:25.666
[Marcus] I, from day one,
started to create

31:25.916 --> 31:28.750
a different life for Alex
than we actually had.

31:35.708 --> 31:39.875
I painted a picture of a normal family.
We lived in a nice house.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.583
Our parents were nice, decent people.

31:44.958 --> 31:46.375
But none of that was true.

31:48.250 --> 31:51.500
It was a fantasy
that I was creating for him.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.375
And the longer it went on,
the bigger the fantasy.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.791
[motorcycle screeching]

31:58.583 --> 32:00.583
[music fades out]

32:07.958 --> 32:10.208
When Alex came back from the hospital,

32:11.166 --> 32:13.375
he didn't know who his mother was.

32:13.833 --> 32:16.666
He didn't know his house.
He didn't know his bedroom.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.250
Didn't know his girlfriend.
He didn't know he was in England.

32:19.333 --> 32:22.000
He didn't know... anything.

32:24.291 --> 32:27.208
But he knew... [loud muffled click] me.

32:28.416 --> 32:29.666
He knew who I was.

32:33.166 --> 32:35.750
If you've only got one fact in your mind,

32:36.416 --> 32:39.708
one thing that you know 100%,
one thing that is yours,

32:40.083 --> 32:42.541
of your own, not something
that anybody's given you,

32:43.250 --> 32:45.541
you then build
everything around that fact.

32:48.041 --> 32:51.416
He had to trust me because
he didn't have anybody else to trust.

32:52.291 --> 32:53.666
Without me, he had nothing.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.333
So I started off,
when he got home, with the basics.

33:00.416 --> 33:04.333
Who are your parents,
where's your room, where's your stuff.

33:05.375 --> 33:09.458
And we did it on that basis.
It was just one fact after the next fact.

33:12.250 --> 33:17.083
And it wasn't until I'd been doing it
for about six months that I realized

33:17.458 --> 33:21.541
that I had some control over
what he knew and what he didn't know.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.875
Because everything that I told him
he accepted and he believed.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.708
So, for instance, he would ask

33:29.208 --> 33:31.083
what family holidays we'd go on.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.583
The truth was
we didn't go on family holidays.

33:38.291 --> 33:41.708
And if we went on a holiday,
we'd go with other people's families.

33:42.458 --> 33:46.458
We'd never go with our parents.
But I didn't want to give him that,

33:46.541 --> 33:51.083
because that was depressing
and sad and not very normal.

33:51.583 --> 33:52.750
So instead of saying,

33:52.833 --> 33:55.875
"Oh, we didn't go on family holidays
because our parents were shit."

33:56.208 --> 33:58.791
I said, "Yeah, we'd go
on family holidays all the time."

33:58.875 --> 34:01.583
Here's a picture of one
of the family holidays in France.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.000
My Dad spoke French.
It seemed like a natural fit.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.000
"Ah, right, that's nice."

34:07.291 --> 34:10.041
And I did manage to find
a picture of us on the beach.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.625
And that seemed to satisfy him.

34:13.833 --> 34:17.916
He didn't say, "Did we go with Mom?"
"Did we go with Dad?"

34:18.666 --> 34:19.916
"Did we all go as a family?”

34:22.083 --> 34:23.791
He didn't ask any of those questions,

34:25.125 --> 34:26.666
and I didn't give him the detail.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.291
I'd give him a photo.

34:32.791 --> 34:34.583
His imagination did the rest.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.375
I gave him a photo album
of happy memories,

34:44.500 --> 34:45.625
happy times.

34:47.291 --> 34:48.333
With none of the shit.

34:55.500 --> 34:59.041
I tried to not make anything up.
I just left stuff out.

35:01.208 --> 35:03.000
If he'd started
challenging me on everything,

35:03.916 --> 35:05.500
the whole thing would've broken down,

35:05.583 --> 35:08.416
and he would've worked out very early on
what was really going on here.

35:12.791 --> 35:14.916
But you've got to remember,
he'd lost all memory.

35:16.250 --> 35:20.041
So I wasn't being challenged
at any point about anything.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.500
So If I said he went on a family holiday,
we went on a family holiday.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.875
Period. He didn't ask again.

35:28.166 --> 35:31.041
And I did that all the way up
until he was 32 years old.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.458
[music fades out]

35:38.250 --> 35:42.666
He had total blind faith
in everything that I told him.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.166
[Alex] That's the key to this whole thing...

35:52.708 --> 35:53.916
is the word trust.

35:55.458 --> 35:58.791
I had no reason not to trust him
or question him.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.166
So that's how-- how this--

36:02.250 --> 36:05.375
A lot of people think, just cannot believe
that this is even possible.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.666
But if you have blinding trust,
it is possible.

36:07.750 --> 36:08.708
[inhales]

36:10.541 --> 36:11.375
[gulps]

36:12.416 --> 36:14.041
I had no reason to doubt him, did I?

36:15.791 --> 36:16.625
[exhales]

36:16.708 --> 36:17.541
[clink]

36:20.833 --> 36:22.583
[Marcus] To start with,
it was quite simple

36:22.666 --> 36:24.125
because I had all the answers.

36:24.791 --> 36:28.916
But, as time goes by,
the questions get more complicated,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.833
the questions get more directed,

36:31.000 --> 36:33.166
and then you have to start remembering

36:33.250 --> 36:35.750
what he haven't told him,
remembering what you have told him.

36:36.458 --> 36:39.625
So then it became
a conscious choice to actually...

36:40.833 --> 36:41.666
lie.

36:41.750 --> 36:43.750
[suspenseful music playing]

36:44.291 --> 36:47.875
So he would ask,
"Is our mother a good mother?"

36:47.958 --> 36:48.875
[inhales]

36:49.583 --> 36:54.166
And I'd say, "Yeah, our mother's cool."
And that would be the end of the question.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.458
You would say to me,
"Well, that's not an acceptable answer.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.875
What am I supposed to do with,
'Our mother's cool.'

37:00.958 --> 37:04.000
I want more. What was she like?
How did she look after us?

37:04.083 --> 37:07.791
Does she love us? [inhales]
You know, has she been a good mother?"

37:08.125 --> 37:10.250
But he wasn't asking
any questions like that.

37:10.333 --> 37:14.375
He just wanted to know,
"Is my mother cool?" "Yes, she is."

37:14.750 --> 37:17.208
Great. Pop that in the memory bank.
Move on.

37:25.375 --> 37:29.375
[Alex] It's amazing I never noticed
that the stories didn't line up.

37:33.375 --> 37:37.083
I cannot believe I never
stopped to say to him,

37:37.333 --> 37:38.958
"That doesn't all fit together."

37:39.958 --> 37:44.333
Right in my entire twenties
I never questioned it.

37:55.666 --> 37:57.041
[soughing wind]

37:57.125 --> 37:59.041
[Marcus] Once I'd stepped into that realm,

38:00.375 --> 38:02.083
of not telling him the truth...

38:04.041 --> 38:05.333
I couldn't get out of it.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.166
And it then just snowballed

38:09.625 --> 38:12.416
to a point I had to stick
with what I'd told him.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.125
[music fades out]

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Because otherwise I had
to admit to him that I'd made

38:18.625 --> 38:21.166
a life up that didn't exist.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.250
[rain pattering]

38:32.083 --> 38:35.125
Lying to my brother has a toll on you.

38:38.375 --> 38:42.208
And it alters the way
that you feel about yourself.

38:44.541 --> 38:49.541
I was lying to my best friend,
my partner, my other half,

38:49.750 --> 38:54.500
every single day.
And the guilt in doing that is so big.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.833
But telling him the truth was

38:57.916 --> 39:00.708
a thousand times worse
than telling him a lie.

39:02.208 --> 39:05.083
So I was damned if I did,
and I was damned if I didn't.

39:06.958 --> 39:08.958
[tires moving over gravel]

39:10.083 --> 39:11.833
So I had to choose between the two.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.583
And so I chose, in the end,

39:18.375 --> 39:22.000
to never tell him the truth
of what happened in his childhood.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.458
[Marcus] We all like to think that

39:39.916 --> 39:42.500
we'd know who a pedophile is
when they walk in a room,

39:43.541 --> 39:45.458
because they've got a big label on them.

39:46.375 --> 39:49.083
But in reality, it's just not like that.

39:53.583 --> 39:56.416
My mother sexually abused us

39:57.041 --> 39:59.125
up to the age of about 12 or 14.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.958
[tearfully] And why would you want
to give that?

40:04.041 --> 40:06.875
I mean, what's that?
I mean that's something...

40:07.375 --> 40:09.041
[normal voice] if I just told you today

40:09.291 --> 40:11.875
that that happened in your childhood,
you knew nothing about it,

40:12.125 --> 40:13.625
it would fuck the rest of your life up.

40:15.708 --> 40:17.458
Why would you feel that it's necessary

40:17.833 --> 40:20.958
to give an emotionally
disturbed 18-year-old

40:21.541 --> 40:23.625
information that he can't handle

40:24.000 --> 40:26.500
and is not necessary for him to know?

40:28.500 --> 40:30.708
And if it was the other round,
I would expect him...

40:31.791 --> 40:33.541
I'd expect him to do the same.

40:34.333 --> 40:37.583
I would want him to do the same.
I'd be angry if he hadn't done it.

40:38.916 --> 40:41.083
And I do feel
very passionately about that.

40:41.541 --> 40:42.458
[inhales deeply]

40:42.541 --> 40:44.666
There are people that say,
"The truth is the truth,

40:44.750 --> 40:47.500
and you should've told him.
And he would have to go to therapy,

40:47.583 --> 40:50.416
and he'd have to deal with all
of those things for the rest of his life.

40:50.666 --> 40:53.791
And it wasn't up to you to play God.
And it wasn't up to you

40:54.375 --> 40:56.541
to-- to take away those things."

40:56.625 --> 40:59.125
[tearfully] But for me, [sniffles]
the way I feel,

41:00.250 --> 41:03.083
I have it... and it's a shit feeling.

41:06.041 --> 41:07.708
[normal voice]
He doesn't have that feeling.

41:07.791 --> 41:10.083
He doesn't know
what it feels like to feel like that.

41:10.166 --> 41:12.333
I gave him a present
of not knowing any of that.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.750
And so, for me, that has to be a gift.

41:16.916 --> 41:19.708
It has to be something precious

41:19.791 --> 41:23.041
that any human being would give
to another one that they love.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.875
[tearfully] Anybody would do that.
[sighs, gulps]

41:45.333 --> 41:47.333
[melancholic music playing]

41:49.375 --> 41:53.583
I had been living this life for Alex

41:54.583 --> 41:55.875
for so many years,

41:57.541 --> 41:59.583
doing all of the things
that I was meant to do

41:59.666 --> 42:02.333
that fitted the narrative
that I'd been giving him.

42:05.083 --> 42:09.166
It would be her birthday, and we'd arrive
at the house, and we'd all hug and kiss.

42:10.625 --> 42:12.666
I mean, I just don't know
what she was thinking.

42:13.958 --> 42:16.125
"Look, I've fucked these boys' lives up,

42:16.208 --> 42:18.000
and here they are
singing Happy Birthday to me."

42:24.083 --> 42:26.833
We'd make a cake,
and we'd all make a fuss, and we'd sing,

42:26.916 --> 42:29.500
and we'd do all of the things
that you were meant to do in a family.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.791
Alex was doing
what it said in the story books.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.791
He was doing what it said in the movies.

42:37.666 --> 42:41.333
"Go and give your Mom a kiss.
Go and give this lady a kiss."

42:43.791 --> 42:45.500
And I watched from the sidelines.

42:51.416 --> 42:55.000
The pain and anguish
that was going on inside me was explosive!

42:56.291 --> 43:00.083
And the power
of just wanting it to go away

43:00.541 --> 43:03.583
is so intense and so strong

43:04.791 --> 43:09.500
that I began to believe
the reality that I was creating.

43:10.666 --> 43:14.541
I needed to feel that actually
it had never happened to me.

43:18.041 --> 43:21.458
Alex lost his memory by accident.

43:23.791 --> 43:26.041
And I lost my memory voluntarily.

43:30.833 --> 43:33.666
And it was great. And I was free.

43:34.916 --> 43:37.500
And I could be rid
of all the things that she'd done to me.

43:38.333 --> 43:41.250
[tearfully] And all this hurt
that she caused me.

43:41.833 --> 43:43.458
[sniffles] And all the shame.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.333
You feel ashamed.

43:48.416 --> 43:49.583
You feel dirty.

43:50.583 --> 43:51.666
You feel used.

43:55.541 --> 43:56.708
And all that was gone.

44:04.666 --> 44:07.166
I then suddenly had a nice childhood.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.916
I then suddenly had nice parents.

44:12.791 --> 44:14.333
I then wasn't abused.

44:15.958 --> 44:18.250
All of these things
never happened to me either.

44:19.541 --> 44:23.083
So I was helping him
not to have that childhood,

44:23.500 --> 44:25.625
and I was helping myself at the same time.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.458
And it was magical.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.041
If I close my eyes
and really concentrated,

44:36.541 --> 44:38.041
of course it would all come back.

44:38.625 --> 44:40.666
But on the surface, on a daily level,

44:41.625 --> 44:43.375
I lived in the same circle as him.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.625
So it was a circle of convenience for me,

44:48.625 --> 44:50.125
and it was a necessary...

44:52.541 --> 44:54.458
evil lie...

44:56.916 --> 44:58.458
whatever you wanna call it for him.

45:03.875 --> 45:04.708
[sniffs]

45:05.791 --> 45:06.625
[gulps]

45:11.625 --> 45:13.125
Once my mother had died,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.208
once we had got her in the ground
and she was gone,

45:17.083 --> 45:20.500
then it was as if
the whole saga was finished.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
[fire crackling]

45:28.000 --> 45:32.541
When Alex found the photo,
he was experiencing confusion.

45:34.291 --> 45:38.250
When I found the photo, I was experiencing

45:39.125 --> 45:41.333
the horror of what had happened to me.

45:43.541 --> 45:44.875
It can't be anything else.

45:45.208 --> 45:47.208
It can't be an accident.

45:47.291 --> 45:49.958
She couldn't have slipped with
the scissors and chopped the heads off.

45:50.750 --> 45:53.500
It was something macabre and disturbing

45:54.500 --> 45:58.458
that needed to be
put back in a jar instantly,

45:59.541 --> 46:02.333
or risk falling into the abyss.

46:04.916 --> 46:08.000
[Alex] That photo changed it for me.

46:09.833 --> 46:13.125
I just walked straight into the kitchen.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.708
Marcus is standing there,
and I said to him,

46:18.333 --> 46:21.791
"Were we sexually abused or not?"

46:22.875 --> 46:24.958
And he turned around, and he went white.

46:25.791 --> 46:28.958
He didn't know what to do. He turned
around, he had a cup of tea in his hand,

46:29.416 --> 46:31.708
and it dropped out
of his hand onto the floor.

46:32.291 --> 46:38.166
In that split second,
the whole circle evaporated instantly.

46:39.208 --> 46:42.625
And I'll never forget it,
because I knew the game was up.

46:42.750 --> 46:45.875
-[melancholic violin music playing]
-And he just looked at me,

46:46.875 --> 46:48.083
he was silent.

46:50.416 --> 46:56.500
He nodded. He just nodded a yes to me.
He didn't say anything, he just nodded.

46:57.416 --> 46:59.541
And then he turned around,
put his back to me,

47:00.583 --> 47:01.958
and walked into the garden.

47:14.125 --> 47:18.041
I say, "Did Mommy abuse us or not?"
He said, "Yes, she did."

47:19.833 --> 47:21.500
He just put his arm around me,

47:22.166 --> 47:23.916
and he said,

47:24.791 --> 47:26.458
"Yeah, it's true."

47:29.291 --> 47:32.000
And we cried, both of us.

47:33.958 --> 47:35.666
[exasperated sigh]

47:38.083 --> 47:39.625
[cries]

47:42.166 --> 47:44.166
[exasperated sigh]

47:49.041 --> 47:52.541
I just cried and cried. [sighs]
[tearfully] For days.

47:54.458 --> 47:55.791
For days and days.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.875
And... I just didn't know what to do.

48:00.875 --> 48:01.708
I...

48:02.583 --> 48:03.916
didn't know what to do.

48:04.500 --> 48:05.416
[sighs]

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I just kept saying, "No, it can't be
Mommy. You've got it wrong."

48:16.625 --> 48:18.375
Our mother couldn't be a pedophile.

48:19.750 --> 48:21.208
She's not that kind of woman.

48:23.458 --> 48:27.791
She had her eccentricities to her,
but she wasn't that.

48:34.166 --> 48:38.041
[Marcus] To my knowledge,
my father never abused us.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.875
And, as much as I hated him
because he was so horrible,

48:43.583 --> 48:46.500
I don't believe he ever knew
that my mother was abusing us.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.750
I would like to think he did,

48:48.833 --> 48:51.708
and he should have done
something about it, but he didn't.

48:54.458 --> 48:56.958
She had that amazing ability to...

48:57.750 --> 48:59.916
almost hypnotize

49:00.208 --> 49:03.416
people around her
and get them to do what she wanted to do.

49:05.083 --> 49:07.041
Everybody thought
she was amazing and lovely,

49:07.500 --> 49:08.791
when underneath she wasn't.

49:09.666 --> 49:13.375
Underneath she was
a very complicated and...

49:15.291 --> 49:16.416
cruel person.

49:20.541 --> 49:23.083
[Alex] As hard as it was to accept
what Mommy had done,

49:24.333 --> 49:27.458
it was much harder to accept
what Marcus had done.

49:31.833 --> 49:35.708
That my own twin had actually lied to me.

49:39.291 --> 49:42.125
-The one person that I absolutely...
-[Marcus sighs]

49:42.541 --> 49:44.208
...trusted 100%

49:44.833 --> 49:45.958
has now betrayed me.

49:48.291 --> 49:49.541
I was angry with him.

49:50.250 --> 49:52.250
Really angry with him
for the first time ever.

49:53.541 --> 49:57.333
I was angry with him
that we knew everything about each other,

49:57.541 --> 50:00.208
and we had no secrets.
We'd do everything together,

50:00.833 --> 50:06.125
yet, behind all of that,
he still had a secret.

50:07.625 --> 50:11.541
How could we have secrets?
We don't have secrets. We're twins.

50:11.833 --> 50:14.125
We're identical twins. We're joined.

50:14.375 --> 50:16.583
Secrets is not something that exists

50:17.333 --> 50:19.583
and has no place in our relationship.

50:21.125 --> 50:22.958
And yet, here it is.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.916
[Marcus] I was almost free of it.

50:25.041 --> 50:29.291
I genuinely got rid of it out of myself,
out of my head.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.375
And Alex had just fucking taken it

50:32.458 --> 50:34.875
from this place
that I'd worked so hard to put it

50:35.083 --> 50:39.500
and just dumped it on the table.
In one second, just like that.

50:41.083 --> 50:43.250
I challenged him on it,

50:43.791 --> 50:47.250
and he just quite simply said
that he wasn't prepared to talk about it.

50:48.166 --> 50:51.750
He said there was sexual abuse,
and that was it.

50:51.875 --> 50:53.208
That was all he gave me.

50:55.333 --> 50:57.500
He would come and ask me, I'd say nothing.

50:57.583 --> 51:00.833
He'd come and ask me, I'd say nothing.

51:01.208 --> 51:03.208
I'd gone into shutdown.

51:03.583 --> 51:05.875
You know what, I've given you
the one piece of information,

51:05.958 --> 51:08.750
I said yes.
That's all you need to know.

51:11.291 --> 51:14.666
And we never spoke about any of it.

51:16.916 --> 51:18.125
[Marcus] I couldn't cope.

51:18.833 --> 51:21.250
I simply could not cope

51:21.833 --> 51:25.458
with the pain, with the--
with the kind of anguish of-- [inhales]

51:25.916 --> 51:28.000
I didn't have the tools to deal with it.

51:29.250 --> 51:31.958
I just wanted to run away
and hide in a hole.

51:33.125 --> 51:34.250
And that's what I did.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
[thunder rumbling]

51:46.125 --> 51:47.416
[heavy rain pattering]

51:54.958 --> 51:56.208
[Alex] I was on my own.

51:57.583 --> 52:01.291
Possibly on my own
for the first time in my entire life.

52:02.375 --> 52:04.375
[melancholic music playing]

52:04.583 --> 52:06.208
I had lost my twin.

52:07.208 --> 52:11.583
My one link to my whole existence.

52:17.916 --> 52:20.500
I was left with no details
of what my mom had done.

52:20.791 --> 52:24.000
I was left with no details
about which part of my life was real

52:24.083 --> 52:25.291
and which parts weren't.

52:26.416 --> 52:27.250
Nothing.

52:28.875 --> 52:30.875
[tires moving over gravel]

52:41.208 --> 52:42.958
What made this so hard

52:43.291 --> 52:46.708
was that I'd built my life
around what Marcus had given me.

52:49.125 --> 52:53.166
So it wasn't that I'd just lost Marcus,
I had also just lost myself.

52:56.166 --> 53:00.625
I've re-built my life
from the age of 18 with nothing.

53:01.791 --> 53:06.041
I'm now 32, and I'm back
to where I was before, ground zero.

53:06.125 --> 53:07.250
I'm back to nothing.

53:07.916 --> 53:10.833
I'm starting again, for the second time.

53:11.916 --> 53:17.291
If that's possible. And I've got
to restructure my entire life again!

53:18.500 --> 53:20.500
[rummaging]

53:27.791 --> 53:29.166
So I started

53:29.750 --> 53:33.375
trying to find out who my mother was,

53:35.125 --> 53:36.833
what sort of person she was.

53:38.875 --> 53:40.750
What was this secret life like?

53:41.125 --> 53:43.125
[melancholic piano music playing]

53:47.708 --> 53:51.708
And that was almost an obsession.

53:56.041 --> 53:58.750
I started piecing things together.

54:00.625 --> 54:05.333
I started finding newspaper clips
of my mother when she was a debutante.

54:05.416 --> 54:09.291
And I started finding,
you know, any pieces of information.

54:14.958 --> 54:17.375
Mixed in with the letters
that you would expect to see,

54:18.375 --> 54:21.375
I found lots of passionate love letters.

54:22.750 --> 54:26.125
Letters from people in the army, colonels,

54:26.208 --> 54:28.208
quite prominent people.

54:30.375 --> 54:33.000
Every single one of them
absolutely adored her.

54:35.916 --> 54:39.541
I started to realize that her whole

54:39.791 --> 54:42.500
life revolved around sex.

54:44.625 --> 54:47.791
She had some sort of spell over them.

54:55.916 --> 54:57.291
I did love my mother.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.583
And she was part of my life.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.625
And it was very, very difficult

55:08.083 --> 55:11.500
to marry up the two moms.

55:13.375 --> 55:15.833
The one I knew
and the one I found out about.

55:17.250 --> 55:19.041
It's just...

55:20.166 --> 55:21.750
bigger than I thought it was.

55:31.250 --> 55:33.458
It sent me into an unbelievable spin.

55:33.541 --> 55:35.375
-[cork popping]
-[people cheering]

55:37.208 --> 55:38.666
What is real and what isn't real?

55:39.875 --> 55:41.625
What if the whole damn lot...

55:41.708 --> 55:43.125
[loud muffled boom]

55:43.375 --> 55:44.833
...is a made up story?

55:49.125 --> 55:52.625
-Nothing makes sense.
-[high pitched ringing]

55:53.583 --> 55:56.541
[motorcycle squeals, loud bang]

55:57.333 --> 55:58.875
What else don't I know?

55:59.291 --> 56:01.291
[silence]

56:13.750 --> 56:15.875
I got so down and so depressed

56:17.666 --> 56:19.458
and so confused...

56:20.291 --> 56:21.666
about who I was.

56:24.750 --> 56:27.291
I even had suicidal thoughts.

56:27.625 --> 56:31.041
I-- I couldn't, I just couldn't cope
with day-to-day life.

56:36.666 --> 56:37.958
And it was very...

56:40.250 --> 56:41.250
difficult...

56:42.708 --> 56:43.666
to deal with.

56:49.125 --> 56:53.083
One of the big things that saves me
was meeting my wife.

56:54.666 --> 56:58.000
I met someone who was prepared
not only to take me on,

56:58.291 --> 57:02.125
but was prepared to take on
this extraordinary history

57:03.500 --> 57:06.958
and help me through
my quest for the truth.

57:08.250 --> 57:09.833
[melancholic music playing]

57:09.958 --> 57:12.375
So we got married,
and we've had two children.

57:13.708 --> 57:16.333
And Marcus also got married,
and he's got two children.

57:16.416 --> 57:17.333
[inhales]

57:17.416 --> 57:19.083
And we both got on with our lives.

57:24.166 --> 57:27.166
[Marcus] I was determined
to not let this affect my life.

57:27.500 --> 57:30.791
So I managed to put it away
into Pandora's box, shut the lid,

57:31.250 --> 57:33.666
and get on with a very happy life.

57:34.416 --> 57:35.541
I've had lots of fun.

57:35.625 --> 57:38.333
I've had amazing relationships.
I've got an amazing wife.

57:38.416 --> 57:41.000
I've done all these incredible things
in my life

57:41.208 --> 57:44.000
without having to deal
with any of that stuff.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.375
I just locked it away.

57:52.500 --> 57:56.041
[Alex] I think what makes
this story even more strange

57:56.458 --> 58:00.083
is the fact
that we do everything together.

58:01.250 --> 58:03.583
For the last 20 years,
we've worked together,

58:03.875 --> 58:06.833
we run our companies together,
we do everything together.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.666
We even wrote a book
about our experience.

58:16.375 --> 58:18.416
But Marcus just wouldn't open up.

58:21.458 --> 58:24.166
He wouldn't go
where I needed him to go.

58:29.125 --> 58:30.625
I had questions,

58:32.000 --> 58:33.458
and I needed answers.

58:34.625 --> 58:37.541
And he wasn't prepared to give them to me.

58:38.625 --> 58:40.875
And still hasn't to this day.

58:43.041 --> 58:43.958
[music fades out]

58:46.666 --> 58:49.250
[Marcus] I've been silent
about the real details

58:49.333 --> 58:50.958
of what happened for 20 years.

58:52.500 --> 58:54.708
And I look back on it now,
it's appalling what I did.

58:55.625 --> 58:57.458
I should have gone and given him a hug.

58:57.625 --> 59:00.541
We should've sat down and talked about it,
"How we're gonna get through it?

59:00.625 --> 59:03.916
Let's go for some therapy.
Let's do this together."

59:04.291 --> 59:05.500
And I did the opposite.

59:08.083 --> 59:10.083
[melancholic music playing]

59:10.791 --> 59:13.333
I left him to hang out and dry,
all on his own.

59:15.541 --> 59:19.333
[scoffs] I mean, I just can't believe
that I was capable of doing that...

59:19.958 --> 59:20.833
to him.

59:21.625 --> 59:24.041
And it's shameful, what I did.

59:26.333 --> 59:29.875
And one day
he'll forgive me for that, but...

59:31.791 --> 59:33.666
[breathes deeply]

59:35.125 --> 59:36.166
It's too much.

59:38.041 --> 59:39.000
Too much.

59:39.666 --> 59:41.666
[breathing deeply]

59:45.916 --> 59:48.000
[music fades out]

59:58.375 --> 59:59.708
[eerie music playing]

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
[breathes deeply]

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:12.416
[Alex] I still don't know who I am.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:17.125
[breathes deeply]

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:20.208
What I need my brother
to do now is talk...

01:00:22.666 --> 01:00:26.833
so I can work out what is real
and what isn't real.

01:00:31.583 --> 01:00:34.166
I need him to give me
the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.666
What really happened

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.000
back in that house

01:00:44.166 --> 01:00:45.375
all those years ago.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:58.875
[gulps]

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:11.291
[gulps]

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:16.625
Bit close to you.

01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:17.875
[Alex chuckles]

01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:22.958
-There you go.
-Yeah. Just a tad.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:31.041
It does seem amazing
that we've done so much together.

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:34.041
We've gone through
so many different things,

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:37.958
but without ever actually sitting down

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:42.125
and saying,
"What was all that about then?"

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.750
I've always felt I never needed to.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:49.000
I've always felt
that you trusted me enough...

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.291
and respected me enough
to not have to know all the details.

01:01:56.833 --> 01:02:00.666
Yeah. I did accept each thing
as you said it along the way,

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:04.083
but sort of the more I learn,
as we've gone through the story,

01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:08.500
the more extraordinary it was

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.416
how I didn't question anything you said.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.541
And the...

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:17.916
cost to me,

01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:19.958
personally, was enormous.

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:25.791
It was a much harder journey
for me to go through

01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:30.000
than you ever imagined
or actually stopped to even work out.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.500
And for me, your secrecy

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:40.166
is something
that I just have found very difficult

01:02:40.666 --> 01:02:43.916
because we know everything together.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:47.250
We're identical twins, we understand
things together, we're linked together.

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.458
Yet we have this

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:52.000
unbelievable

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.625
separation of silence

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:57.291
that I'm desperately trying
to ask questions,

01:02:57.375 --> 01:02:59.333
and you're desperately trying
not to answer them.

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:03.458
And for me, I feel...

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:08.708
that once I've got it,
I can stop my journey.

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:12.541
Do you see what I mean?
I need to stop my journey.

01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:14.500
I need to stop searching.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.958
And you can finally be rid of it

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.166
at the same time, so we've both
got something to gain from this.

01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:23.083
-Just as much as each other.
-I know we have.

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:24.666
You know.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.000
And you've got to understand that
once you came to me

01:03:27.458 --> 01:03:29.500
on that day that I'll never forget
and you asked

01:03:29.916 --> 01:03:31.291
whether our mother abused us,

01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:34.166
and I simply said, "Yes"
but nothing else...

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.333
I thought that was perfectly adequate

01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:40.208
and you could get on
with your life with that.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:44.416
But it wasn't. It wasn't for me.

01:03:45.458 --> 01:03:46.541
That one moment...

01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:49.000
cost me dearly.

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:51.708
Well, it cost me pretty hard, Alex,

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:57.833
because by giving that to you,
I then had to give it all back to myself,

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:00.833
which I'd spent
fucking years getting rid of.

01:04:01.416 --> 01:04:03.625
Burying and burying and burying it.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.833
Silence, silence, silence.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.583
Yeah, but it allowed me
to have a free life,

01:04:10.166 --> 01:04:11.625
as you were having a free life.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.625
Free of child abuse.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:17.833
When I took it away from you,
I took it away from me.

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:19.875
Do you not understand that?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.541
I'd been silent for me.

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:29.583
For me.

01:04:32.041 --> 01:04:34.416
[tearfully] If I gave it to you,
I had to give it to me.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.750
And I have not been ready
to break the silence.

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:41.125
A silence is a lie.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:43.583
I have been lying to myself

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:47.541
for 20 years that I was abused.

01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:50.958
That is my defense mechanism.

01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:54.250
It is a lie. Being silent is a lie.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:57.458
And telling you what you wanted to know

01:04:58.458 --> 01:04:59.958
is breaking the silence.

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:03.541
-Any of the information?
-Anything, Alex,

01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:06.583
anything more than,
"Yes, my mother abused us."

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:09.416
I gave you the informa-- You asked me
a question, I told you the answer.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.416
Everything else is off the table.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.333
I couldn't cope with it anymore.

01:05:17.958 --> 01:05:19.791
[tearfully]
Don't you understand, Ali?

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.250
[tearfully] No, I didn't.
I didn't understand.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:25.666
-That's why. That's why, Ali.
-I didn't understand it.

01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:29.250
I couldn't do that.

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:31.791
I was too much of a coward.

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:34.750
Totally and utterly too much of a coward

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.208
to give you anything,

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.083
anything.

01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:42.625
[normal voice] So I've spent 20 years
searching for it.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.875
Driving myself mad.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:50.333
Spending hours talking to people,
finding things, scraps of information.

01:05:51.125 --> 01:05:54.625
-It ran, it totally ran my life.
-But why couldn't you let it go?

01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:56.833
-Why couldn't you accept it?
-I c-- I couldn't.

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:59.083
I just could not let it go.

01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:01.583
Do you understand why
I couldn't give it to you?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.208
Yeah, I do. I do understand that.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.250
So I was silently doing all my stuff,

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:11.708
trying to find it, and you were silently
trying not to give me anything.

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:14.708
-I had no choice, Ali.
-And so it went on and on and on.

01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.250
I had no choice.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.125
We're 54 years old.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.166
Fifty-four years old, for fuck's sake.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:28.458
Having this conversation now.

01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:31.083
We should have had it when we were 20.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:34.250
What a fucking waste of 30 years.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:36.708
Honestly.

01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:40.541
But we're here now.

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:43.541
Yeah, we are.

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:57.375
[inhales, exhales softly]

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.583
[sighs]

01:07:12.166 --> 01:07:13.000
I--

01:07:14.958 --> 01:07:17.750
I don't think I've got the strength
to tell you to your face

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:19.250
what really happened.

01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:23.375
But I have had
a conversation about it on camera

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.458
and maybe you should have a look at that.

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:29.916
And that will give you everything
that you need to know.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.666
And you're happy for me to see that?

01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:39.166
I'm not saying I'm happy. I'm feeling that

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:41.000
-I have a necessity.
-A necessity.

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:45.666
It's a necessity, Alex.
We've come to the end of the lie.

01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:47.875
You look at it.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:51.125
[tearfully] But I just can't do it
to your face, Ali.

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.083
I'm gonna go away and let you watch it.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:55.750
And then we're done.

01:07:56.958 --> 01:07:58.500
-Okay.
-Are you ready to do that?

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:01.208
Yes.

01:08:07.666 --> 01:08:09.958
Well, you're making me
very scared now, but...

01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:13.750
I don't really understand
why you need to see it.

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:15.541
I still don't get it.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.125
So we can be
fully connected again, Markie.

01:08:20.625 --> 01:08:23.125
-I guess so.
-I need the lie to stop.

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:27.416
And I need my life to be real.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.082
My life is not real.
My life is the one you gave me, Markie.

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.082
My life is what you wanted it to be.

01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:37.875
My life has been dictated by you.

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:41.166
I need something. I need to own this.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.541
-Okay. All right.
-Okay?

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.416
[sighs]

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.791
[gulps]

01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:27.125
[exhales]

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:29.582
[click]

01:09:47.707 --> 01:09:48.541
[sighs]

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:51.332
[breathes deeply]

01:10:03.208 --> 01:10:04.875
I've never told a living soul...

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:07.458
about what happened.

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:12.541
I barely told myself what happened.

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.625
So you're asking me to give you something

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:20.583
that I've never given
to anybody in my life.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:27.166
[breathes deeply]

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:33.166
[sniffs]

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:34.291
[gulps]

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.583
Okay.

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:51.958
[clink]

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.250
[breathes deeply]
Just as a "fuck you" to her. Let's do it.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:06.375
My mother would take us into her room...

01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:09.250
she would take us into her bed.

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.375
She would make us touch each other.

01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:16.208
She would make us play with each other.

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:21.750
She would touch us.
She would masturbate us.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.583
She would do things that no mother
should ever do to their child.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.291
And then she moved on.

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:34.958
Not only did she want to do those things
for her own gratification,

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:38.041
she then passed us around to her friends.

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:42.291
So she would drive us to friends' houses,

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:46.708
have dinner and a glass of wine,
and then leave us there.

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.875
Never together, always on our own.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.916
And then some strange man
that I'd never met and I never knew

01:11:56.416 --> 01:11:59.958
would take me into his bed
and touch me

01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:04.041
and rape me and violate me.

01:12:05.916 --> 01:12:07.500
For his gratification.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.916
And then, in the morning,
my mother would come and pick me up

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:13.500
and drive me home.

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:17.291
Never speaking, never talking.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:21.916
What did I do in the car?
I was silent and I was quiet.

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:26.375
Always silent, always quiet.

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.708
And then it would happen again and again.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.083
And then she would take Alex away.

01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:35.416
I would be lying in my bed...

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.875
-[sobbing]
-...in my room.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:40.625
Alex wouldn't be there, he's my twin.

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.958
He would be staying with a friend.

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:47.166
And this was something
that was a normality in our life.

01:12:47.375 --> 01:12:49.041
This was something we grew up with.

01:12:49.875 --> 01:12:51.208
And we accept it.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.708
Children accept it.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:57.791
Children will accept anything
because they love their parents.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:03.916
And they think that what their parents
is doing is part of growing up.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.416
We don't have the capacity

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.708
to feel that we...

01:13:10.541 --> 01:13:11.875
[tearfully] know it's wrong.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:13.208
And...

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:15.458
[gulps]

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.416
[normal voice] even now,
all these years later,

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:20.791
I think to myself,

01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:23.041
"Fuck you, Mother.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:27.833
How fucking dare you think
that you can do that to me?"

01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:33.791
But she's gone. She's died.
She's got away with it.

01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:36.666
And I can't say that to her.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.375
And I regret that.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.583
I bitterly regret that.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:44.958
[gulps]

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.125
But now... I'm speaking out.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.333
Now I'm telling you.

01:13:50.958 --> 01:13:53.625
I've never met you all.
I don't know who you are.

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:58.333
[tearfully] But you know who my mother is.
And you know what she's done is wrong.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.625
[exasperated sigh]
And that's very powerful.

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:05.416
And I need that.

01:14:07.541 --> 01:14:08.625
We all need that.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.833
[exhales]

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:14.250
[sniffles]

01:14:30.958 --> 01:14:31.875
[sighs]

01:14:47.833 --> 01:14:49.833
[breathes deeply]

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.291
[leaves rustling]

01:15:11.083 --> 01:15:13.083
[car engine starts]

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:18.875
[tires moving over gravel]

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:30.791
[car engine fading away]

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:37.041
[silence]

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.041
[chair dragging]

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.125
[Marcus exhales]

01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:01.875
I knew some of that.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:05.375
I guessed some of that.
I thought about some of that.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:08.791
I just didn't know the magnitude of it.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.250
I didn't know it was as big as that.

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.333
[eerie music playing]

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.333
[exhales]

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
[rain pattering]

01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:44.250
[Alex] How d-- how did we get out
of that house in one piece?

01:16:48.333 --> 01:16:49.833
Do you want to hear about all that?

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:53.166
We're here now.
We're never gonna do this again.

01:16:55.083 --> 01:16:56.416
[grunts]

01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.875
So, the last time that I was...

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:04.125
passed about, for want of a better word...

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:08.750
I was driven to London by Mommy.

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:14.500
She had dinner with this guy, an artist.

01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:17.916
Supposedly quite a famous artist.

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:19.625
We had dinner.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
She left.

01:17:22.916 --> 01:17:24.458
And I stayed in the house.

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:30.208
And then he came into my-- into this room,
which was surrounded by paintings

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:31.875
and it had a four-poster bed,

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:34.291
and he got into into the bed
with me and started touching me.

01:17:37.083 --> 01:17:39.916
[clicks tongue]
And I was 14 years old.

01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:45.250
And once he got down to my genitals...

01:17:46.791 --> 01:17:49.000
I sat up in bed and I said, "No.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.125
I don't want this. I don't like this."

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:55.000
And I pushed him away,

01:17:55.541 --> 01:17:58.791
and he got very aggressive.
And I managed to get out of his house.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:03.708
-And I got home.
-How did you get home?

01:18:05.625 --> 01:18:06.875
How's that even possible?

01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:10.541
I walked down to the tube.

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:15.708
I jumped on a tube with no money,
but you could do in those days.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:18.041
I got onto the train with no money.

01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:20.708
And I walked home.

01:18:29.833 --> 01:18:32.458
And I came in, I knocked on the window,
and you let me in.

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:36.708
I got into my bed and I went to sleep.

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.250
-And the next day we carried on--
-What the hell did Mommy say to that then?

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:45.458
How-- She didn't even know
you were in the house?

01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:49.375
Nothing. I came up in the morning.
We had breakfast.

01:18:49.833 --> 01:18:51.875
She looked very surprised
that I was there.

01:18:53.625 --> 01:18:56.833
And I looked at her. And she looked at me.

01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.875
And it never happened again.

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:04.625
-And that was the end of it, Ali.
-Without saying anything?

01:19:04.833 --> 01:19:06.583
[tearfully] Without saying anything.

01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:09.625
[mutters] Fuck.

01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:15.166
And she never did it to you again.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.083
You never left.
You never were out of the house again.

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:21.291
And it was finished.

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:23.791
[gulps]

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:26.083
That's how it stopped.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:28.208
[sighs]

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:49.333
[breathes deeply]

01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.625
Now you've got everything.

01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:55.583
You've got everything, Ali.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.333
That's what I needed.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:02.166
That's what I needed.

01:20:03.625 --> 01:20:04.458
Yeah.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
No more lies! No more lies.

01:20:07.958 --> 01:20:10.208
No more silence. No more secrets.

01:20:14.666 --> 01:20:17.958
And I have you back... with me.

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:23.458
[exhales]

01:20:25.416 --> 01:20:27.416
[both crying]

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:36.541
[groans]

01:20:37.916 --> 01:20:38.791
[sobs]

01:20:45.416 --> 01:20:47.416
[birds chirping]

01:21:04.541 --> 01:21:07.541
[Alex] There is no way for me to repay him
for what he's done.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.750
And there is no words I can say to him.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:19.791
But he knows.

01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:22.041
And that's enough.

01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:30.583
It's over.

01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:33.041
Finally.

01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:37.833
And we move on.

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:56.041
[soft piano music playing]
