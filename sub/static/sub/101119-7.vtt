WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:07.375
Previously on "P-Valley"...

00:07.408 --> 00:12.346
How, like, serious are you
about this music thing?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.582
What, you trying to be Keyshia Ka'Oir
to my Gucci Mane?

00:14.615 --> 00:17.752
Slide through this Sunday for Murda Night.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.153
You don't wanna miss it.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.255
Murda Night.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.157
The Pynk is going up
on the auction block next week.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.392
Next week!

00:24.425 --> 00:26.093
How you doing, Hailey?

00:26.127 --> 00:30.531
Chucalissa looks so beautiful
in the morning from here.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.700
I wanted to see it one more time
before I go.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.435
Good-bye, Andre.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.304
You dead to me.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.739
You posted my bail?

00:38.773 --> 00:42.276
Since I got you out, you owe me.

00:42.309 --> 00:45.379
My wife went missing
the day Hurricane Drake hit.

00:45.413 --> 00:49.617
I'll get my deputies to put up some flyers
around town, quick fast.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.685
Who should I ask for if I get word back?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.220
Montavius Hill.

00:53.254 --> 00:56.223
Leasing to the casino
is what we should be doing.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.093
- What the fuck are you doing, Wayne?
- What the fuck you think I'm doing?

01:00.294 --> 01:02.363
I think we should lease
the Kyle farm instead.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.598
- Lease?
- Pay the Kyle family what they're worth,

01:04.632 --> 01:05.599
not what they want.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.661
All right, heifer.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.929
You ready to do this?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.332
What in the hell?

04:25.366 --> 04:28.335
Now, you look here, Patrice, okay?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.838
What you not gon' do is disrespect me,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.806
'cause I could have easily let your ass
rot in that jail

04:32.840 --> 04:34.508
after what you did to my 'Cedes.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.012
But this thing here is...

04:39.346 --> 04:40.748
...it's bigger than the both of us.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.983
Wouldn't you agree?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.620
Well, you know what they say.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.022
The enemy of my enemy is...

04:48.055 --> 04:51.592
Is some dastardly bitch I gots
to be involved with for the time being,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.795
'cause as soon as this mess over with...

04:56.563 --> 04:58.032
...I don't know you.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.868
Pussy Valley, baby!

05:01.869 --> 05:03.771
This wasn't what we agreed on.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.873
Well, believe me, I know.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.308
I know.

05:08.342 --> 05:12.646
But in the new agreement, the Kyle family
get half a million up front

05:12.680 --> 05:14.081
with a monthly lease payment of 15K...

05:14.314 --> 05:17.017
That ain't nowhere near
the $6 million you promised us.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.053
Knowing the grief this may have caused
the Kyle family,

05:19.086 --> 05:21.088
I've worked hard
with Promised Land Equities

05:21.321 --> 05:22.823
to make leasing worth your while.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.358
In what way?

05:24.391 --> 05:27.861
When this casino deal goes through,
the Kyle family get one percent

05:27.895 --> 05:29.496
of the gross of the casino's revenue.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.799
One percent? What if it don't go through?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.467
Oh, it's gonna go through.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.569
Well, ain't this pouring sugar on shit?

05:35.602 --> 05:38.505
Shit with sugar on it
is better than nothing,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.074
don't you think, Wyatt?

05:43.010 --> 05:47.081
So which way do you gentlemen
want to sign this?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.416
We can do it the old-fashioned way...

05:51.819 --> 05:53.120
...or my way.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.932
Corbin already signed
this leasing agreement?

06:04.965 --> 06:08.068
First thing this morning,
and let me tell you,

06:08.102 --> 06:10.537
he didn't need a gun to his head to do it.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.120
Mayor Ruffin, you ran on a campaign
that you was a man of your word.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.122
I am.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.025
It seems your godson is not.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.460
No matter.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.931
See, 'cause once the council
votes through that casino,

06:37.965 --> 06:41.635
very next thing we gon' do
is elect a new mayor.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.518
I am feeling

06:57.551 --> 07:00.754
like I am standing behind a tractor

07:00.788 --> 07:02.756
in the middle of a field.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.894
I am getting a lot of shit
kicked at me, Andre.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.529
It's what Promised Land wanted.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.831
Or is it what you wanted?

07:10.864 --> 07:14.835
Did you go behind your god-daddy back
and renege on this deal?

07:16.136 --> 07:19.940
You gon' be late to the ribbon cutting
in the Promised Land Park.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.210
Oh, my bad. I meant to say
the Tydell Ruffin Park.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.579
Oh, I pity you.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.849
Pray tell, why I deserve such
an expensive emotion from you.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.018
The folks who deserve
your concern don't get it,

07:31.051 --> 07:34.021
and the folks you shouldn't be concerned
about get to tell you what to do.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.925
I have to keep the promises
to certain folk around here, Andre.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
You got bad knees, God-daddy.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.528
Don't stay down there too long.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.963
You motherfucker, you!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.098
I'ma fuck you up, nigga.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.134
This town's let these boys
get away with murder

07:47.167 --> 07:49.069
longer than one can count, and you,

07:49.102 --> 07:51.772
you want to give them
millions of dollars for nothing

07:51.805 --> 07:53.574
just because you owe them something.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.008
Where's your integrity?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.176
Integrity?

07:56.210 --> 07:59.580
Nigga, do you know Chucalissa
got a unemployment rate

07:59.613 --> 08:02.015
that's double the national average

08:02.049 --> 08:05.919
and an education system
that don't even graduate half its kids?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.856
The revenue garnered from the casino
could change all that.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.225
I am trying to do good for my city!

08:12.059 --> 08:15.262
But you don't see like I see.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.198
You up here talking about integrity.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.199
Shit, man.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.702
I'm the one that drank
from another water fountain

08:21.735 --> 08:23.036
when I was growing up.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.106
I'm the one that walked six fucking miles

08:26.139 --> 08:29.009
to go to a good school, and your crown...

08:29.042 --> 08:33.547
your crown has been bought
and paid for, boy, by niggas like me.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.984
So don't you sit up here and think
that you done did something

08:37.017 --> 08:39.686
because you done one-upped some cracker.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.657
Somebody got to pay for it, boy,
and it ain't gon' be you.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.560
Everything costs, son.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.928
Everything.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.964
Just like that Morehouse tuition
your god-daddy paid

08:50.998 --> 08:53.767
when your mama and daddy couldn't.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.271
Mayor Ruffin? Mayor?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.939
Eloise.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.642
Look, I said I would be down in a minute.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.311
Now, just gon' get the car ready so we
can get ready for that ribbon cutting.

09:04.544 --> 09:09.283
The ribbon cutting's been postponed
due to unforeseeable events.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.118
What? What, it's raining?

09:13.153 --> 09:16.023
Protestors have gathered
at the new Tydell Ruffin Park.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.125
Word has spread the development company

09:18.158 --> 09:20.227
called Promised Land Equities

09:20.260 --> 09:22.296
has some big plans for Chucalissa.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.832
Most folks think the end of days look like

09:25.866 --> 09:28.769
a bunch of hellfire and brimstone,

09:28.802 --> 09:31.271
but I done been to the mountaintop

09:31.305 --> 09:33.941
and talked with my Lord,

09:33.974 --> 09:37.878
and He told me that the fall of man

09:37.911 --> 09:39.713
look a whole lot like a party.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.984
Like dancing and drinking and blackjack.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.787
A Russian roulette for your soul!

09:46.820 --> 09:49.623
I'ma need all y'all to sign...

09:49.656 --> 09:52.326
Eloise, get Sheriff Bailey on the horn.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.061
A vote to ban this casino...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.262
Okay, for...

09:55.295 --> 09:56.930
Just get him!

09:56.964 --> 09:59.633
Hey, hey, ho, ho! This casino's gotta go!

09:59.666 --> 10:02.669
Can you please pull your dick
out of my ass, Andre?

10:02.703 --> 10:03.804
Sheriff Bailey, please.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.306
- Next?
- Yeah, girl, he ate me out.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.642
IUD and all.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.278
Girl, you know Craig
is always complaining about...

10:11.311 --> 10:13.280
If you a Saint, come on down to my new church,

10:13.313 --> 10:16.883
the Breath of Life,
Full Gospel Baptist Tabernacle,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.952
off Old Hacks Cross Road.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.021
We got a petition on the altar.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.926
And if you a Ain't,
you come on down to The Pynk,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.195
and you sign that petition there.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.763
Now y'all hoes know where we at.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.799
I'm finna go on down that church
and sign, too.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.370
Hell, yeah, 'cause we don't need
no casinos in Chucalissa.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.873
You know what?
I hope your damn IUD blow up.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.375
God damn.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.645
She tripping.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.048
Next.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.950
This casino's gotta go!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.051
Next!

10:54.755 --> 10:56.690
That thing gon' get you where you going?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.359
It better.

11:28.755 --> 11:31.224
Please tell me you at least
got a lick or two in.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.867
Well, that's what I'm talking about.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.336
The last time you and your brothers
got to fighting like that,

11:43.370 --> 11:45.972
it was over that three-tittied girl Lacy.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.808
Wyatt was the one won that fight.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.777
Don't know why y'all was fighting.
There was a titty to go round for everybody.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.113
Casino finally gave me my lease.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.283
Why you look so upset about it then?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.986
Why are you out here running around
protesting the casino, Clifford?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.824
Hell, I want the deal you got.
I want in on this leasing thing, too.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.193
Yeah, but wasn't everybody
supposed to know about it.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.296
You know how these backwoods niggers are.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.898
Corbin, your cracker side overriding.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.469
You best replace that "er" with a "uh."

12:15.502 --> 12:18.338
What I'm saying...
you give these folks a chance

12:18.371 --> 12:20.507
to say no to something like a casino,
they gon' do it.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.942
It's the Bible Belt.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.777
City council's supposed
to slip it in on 'em.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.479
Now everybody think they got a say,

12:25.512 --> 12:28.748
and that threatens
all the shit folks got planned.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.985
Well, it helps me, gives me some leverage,
okay, to help save my club.

12:32.018 --> 12:34.087
Your club being saved
wasn't a part of the plan.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.958
This casino might go away
without your waterfront property.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.294
Now, they want my land,
they just gon' have to make me a deal,

12:41.328 --> 12:43.063
like that 6 million
that they done offered you.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.866
You know white folks ain't gonna pay
for shit they get for free.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.004
So if I stay, what happens to you?

12:52.005 --> 12:52.973
Your leasing deal?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.341
It goes away.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.913
And my leasing deal,
it ain't gon' go away.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.520
And here I thought I was about to ask you
for a loan to help me save The Pynk.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
I ain't got no money for that.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.190
I bet you don't.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.160
But I do wonder
if you got enough to buy the tapes

13:13.193 --> 13:16.796
of you getting your ass beat
and coming in your drawers in my club.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.498
- You trying to blackmail me?
- No.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.969
I just know you best not never,

13:23.003 --> 13:26.039
ever roll up into The Pynk again.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.544
You want your ass beat...

13:32.045 --> 13:33.547
...you go on to your brothers.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.216
I'm sure they'll do you right.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.354
Country boy, home bred

13:41.388 --> 13:43.089
Raised off of cornbread

13:43.123 --> 13:44.491
Started off with short paper

13:44.524 --> 13:46.259
Now I'm having long bread

13:48.128 --> 13:49.296
Hey, hey

13:49.329 --> 13:50.964
Take it straight to the Pynk

13:50.997 --> 13:52.365
'Bout to blow a couple racks

13:52.399 --> 13:55.368
I send the pack out, bring the racks in

13:55.402 --> 13:57.837
Nigga, where the barbecue at?

13:57.871 --> 14:00.106
'Cause this some slaw, bro.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.142
I'm serious, man. What y'all gon' do?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.277
I don't know, man.
Show in, like, four hours.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.312
DJ?

14:08.248 --> 14:09.382
Hey, yo, what the fuck?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.084
I was just getting to the bridge.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.355
Bae, we need a break.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.928
You murdered that track, all right,
but not in a good way.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.930
I'm straight, I'm straight.
I just need to practice.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.498
No, you need to get over
your stage fright.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.933
Man, I ain't scared of nothing.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.603
Hey, I get it.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.939
You being up there,

14:32.973 --> 14:35.175
baring your all like that
in front of 300...

14:35.208 --> 14:36.876
300 folks? It's 300 folks coming tonight?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.246
Nigga, I'ma need you
to pull it together for tonight.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.280
I'm straight.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.649
I'm straight.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.118
No, Lil Murda, you ain't.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.454
But you 'bout to be.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.624
Every day...

14:51.958 --> 14:54.661
...a million thoughts go through my head

14:54.894 --> 14:58.298
about how I'm not good enough
to be on that stage.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.134
But when them lights come on, guess what.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.938
I got to block it out,
show up, and show out.

15:04.971 --> 15:06.640
I don't know, Keyshawn.
How the fuck this supposed to help?

15:06.673 --> 15:08.041
Nigga, I'ma need you to trust me.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.076
Same way you strip yourself
naked on that track

15:10.110 --> 15:12.946
is the same way you got to strip
yourself naked on that stage.

15:18.385 --> 15:22.122
Close your eyes and feel it.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.060
Now open your eyes...

15:27.994 --> 15:29.329
...and see the crowd.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.665
That's who you rapping to.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.134
Tell 'em what you got to say.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.170
Country boy, home bred

15:37.203 --> 15:38.672
Raised off of cornbread

15:38.705 --> 15:40.373
Started off with short paper

15:40.407 --> 15:42.208
Now I'm having long bread

15:42.242 --> 15:43.476
Dice game, shooting craps

15:43.510 --> 15:45.145
Lose it all and make it back

15:45.178 --> 15:46.680
Take it straight to the Pynk

15:46.713 --> 15:48.148
'Bout to blow a couple racks

15:48.181 --> 15:50.617
I send the pack out,
and I bring the racks in

15:50.650 --> 15:52.452
Don't get caught with the backhand

15:52.485 --> 15:54.287
Bitch, I'm from the flatlands

15:54.321 --> 15:55.955
Go and get me a lap dance

15:55.989 --> 15:57.490
Booty sound like she clapped hands

15:57.524 --> 16:00.593
'Cause we right by the boot,
better know that we tapped in

16:00.627 --> 16:01.661
Yeah!

16:01.695 --> 16:04.097
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

16:04.130 --> 16:05.432
That's what the fuck I'm talking 'bout.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.433
Yeah, yeah.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.703
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.318
Oh, Lord. What the hell now?

16:32.726 --> 16:35.061
Those wheels make me dizzy.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.438
No, no. Afraid I can't take that no more.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.140
Well, you've been taking it.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.709
Clifford, I don't know what you done did
to ruffle his feathers,

16:49.743 --> 16:52.412
but Mayor Ruffin is really
cracking down on The Pynk.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.281
So it's my duty to inform you

16:55.315 --> 16:58.785
that if we see any exposed breasts
while The Pynk is serving alcohol,

16:59.018 --> 17:00.220
I'm gon' have to shut you down.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.356
- This on some bullshit, Sheriff Bailey!
- Look, I'm just doing my job.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.493
Since when your job description include
harassing citizens off they property?

17:08.161 --> 17:09.496
Look... Shit.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.800
I can't believe y'all going up
for auction tomorrow,

17:14.033 --> 17:17.170
but for what it's worth,
I'ma be sad to see y'all go.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.505
- The Pynk is something...
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:18.538 --> 17:22.041
Let me tell you something,
'cause I got a message for the mayor.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.411
You tell that motherfucker
that if The Pynk going down,

17:24.444 --> 17:26.679
I ain't gon' be
the only one sucking dick,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.215
'cause I's blessed and highly favored.

17:29.716 --> 17:34.454
So them casino folks best get ready,
'cause I loves me some deep throat.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.591
Now, if you excuse me.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.700
Shit.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.680
Big L, you are the worse-est damn security!

18:43.857 --> 18:45.692
What?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.761
I saw your midnight blue
black ass on TV with my mama.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.366
You the one bailed
Patrice ass out of jail.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.869
What, you want her to do stay there
till she just died and went to hell?

18:55.902 --> 18:59.138
Uncle Clifford, how the fuck you joining forces
with the fucking devil herself?

18:59.172 --> 19:02.208
'Cause, child, I got a big mouth,
but your mama mouth bigger,

19:02.242 --> 19:04.644
now I thought she might be able to help me
stop these Promised Land crackers

19:04.677 --> 19:06.446
from putting The Pynk up on the cross.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.616
But it's too late.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.520
It's too late.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.690
I done pulled every favor I have
in this town, all to no avail.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.561
The Pynk going up on the auction tomorrow.

19:23.630 --> 19:27.233
Cedes, look, without this club...

19:30.403 --> 19:32.572
Without this club, I don't have nothing.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.908
And these girls...

19:36.175 --> 19:37.377
These girls...

19:37.410 --> 19:39.712
Ain't no orphanage for hoes.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.247
And who gon' hire Big L?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.918
Hell, I barely wanted to hire Big L.
He scary.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.788
What Uncle Clifford rule number 24.5?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.757
There's no crying at The Pynk.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.926
Exactly. Now, what done is done.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.464
Question is, what you gon' do now?

20:05.772 --> 20:07.807
Uncle Clifford rule 55.99.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.844
Even when there ain't no money raining...

20:11.878 --> 20:13.713
Dance like tonight's your last night.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.852
Look, I can't do it
without my bottom bitch.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.423
I done told you.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.858
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.261
No, no, no, no, no,
them good-goods on that shelf right there,

20:28.294 --> 20:29.562
they ain't expired yet!

20:29.596 --> 20:30.863
Come on, Mercedes. Please.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.233
Why don't you ask your new ace boon coon,

20:34.267 --> 20:36.402
Pastor Woodbine, to dance?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.273
So you gon' just turn your back on them?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.809
Them folks your framily.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.479
Come on, Cedes,
after all the shit I done done for you.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.585
Hey, let's show these niggas
one final good time.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.995
Don't you make me bury The Pynk
without my bottom bitch.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.441
A ghost!

21:15.475 --> 21:16.943
Bitch, I ain't no ghost.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.344
Told y'all.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.880
My bitch came back to slay all day.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.518
- Who bust you out of jail?
- It sho'll wun't you.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.553
Ain't that one of my floss you got on?

21:28.521 --> 21:32.058
I would ask for it back,
but your ass can have that.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.494
My bitch back. I told you.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.063
Maite, I'ma need you to whip me up
something quick fast for tonight.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.067
It got to look like the universe
done bust a nut all over my body.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.669
You know how that look like, Maite.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.704
This floss has missed your ass.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.474
Hell, no.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.376
So this your last dance for real-for real?

21:50.410 --> 21:53.046
It's everybody last dance. Yours included.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.481
I hope y'all bitches got y'all plan B,

21:55.515 --> 21:57.083
and I ain't talking
about no morning-after pill.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.520
I'm all about that last drop.

22:16.602 --> 22:19.906
I see why Uncle Clifford fourth rule
is no motherfucking chips.

22:20.573 --> 22:24.577
And just to think,
I put my naked ass on this couch.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.747
My last two drops.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.417
The rest of your payment.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.590
That's too much.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.427
Think of it as a parting gift.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.397
I did 10K worth of work. You give me 10K.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.599
What about your gym?
Don't you need 10 more K?

22:46.632 --> 22:48.000
Don't worry about me.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.936
I gots me a plan to
help Finesse the rest.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.775
So you really finna go?

22:57.110 --> 22:58.611
You say bye to Uncle Clifford?

22:59.078 --> 23:01.481
I don't think Uncle Clifford will miss me.

23:01.514 --> 23:04.951
She might not, but that nigga Andre?

23:04.984 --> 23:06.619
You say bye to him?

23:08.821 --> 23:11.524
Bitch. You got to say good-bye.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.593
- I called him.
- You called him.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.461
- He's married.
- So?

23:15.495 --> 23:19.098
Oh, so you got so much integrity
about some things, but marriage?

23:19.132 --> 23:21.033
Just fuck somebody's vows?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.102
Every bitch sharing they nigga
with somebody else.

23:23.136 --> 23:24.937
If it ain't they mama,
it's they baby mama.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.806
But you got to want something
more than that.

23:26.839 --> 23:30.009
Ain't no love for ladies selling lust,

23:30.042 --> 23:31.978
'cause that's all they'll ever want from you,

23:32.011 --> 23:34.647
'cause that's what we give 'em first.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.151
If I was you, I'd bring him down here.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.053
Give him something to remember me by.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.488
No.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.629
I wish I would've had got a chance to say
good-bye to somebody once.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.966
Biggest regret of my life I ain't do it.

23:56.435 --> 24:00.506
Hell, you already here,
and tonight everybody last call.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.010
Let's turn this Pynk funeral out right.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.050
These backwater-ass Bible
thumpers done fucked up our park.

24:24.664 --> 24:28.234
After we acquire the Pynk
at the auction tomorrow,

24:28.467 --> 24:30.636
I'm done with you.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.048
Circle up, circle up. Come on.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.520
Hey, look, I wish things
could be different,

24:47.553 --> 24:50.990
but sometimes in life you got to
take an L to get to the W,

24:51.023 --> 24:53.059
this, unfortunately,
one of them times.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.261
Gidget, hey, hey.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.864
This building got enough water damage,
and you know how we do.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.732
We don't do no goddamn tears.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.035
All right, now,
'cause the mayor's ass-backwards

25:03.069 --> 25:04.770
no-titties-and-tequila ordinance,

25:04.804 --> 25:07.573
we can't have no exposed breas-ta-ses
in the VIPS tonight.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.908
No, hell, no!

25:08.941 --> 25:12.111
How the hell we supposed to make
that VIP bank covering up all our assets?

25:12.144 --> 25:14.247
We ain't got to show titties
just to make this coin.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.516
We just got to shake them
Tia and Tamaras so hard,

25:17.550 --> 25:19.252
niggas think they see titties.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.721
Y'all listen to my bottom bitch,

25:21.754 --> 25:24.657
'cause we gon' make it with the help
of the boss bitch above.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.993
Now let's all bow our heads in prayer.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.763
Lord, we ask that You bless
The Pynk tonight,

25:30.796 --> 25:35.167
as we try to go out
with one last, big-ass bang.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.769
- Please, Jesus.
- I need this.

25:36.802 --> 25:41.073
Help DJ Neva Scared bump his beats
like he ain't never bump 'em before.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.775
Amen, boss.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.845
And help Maite dress our girls
in her best floss finery.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.246
- Love it.
- Jesus!

25:47.280 --> 25:49.148
- Damn.
- Please make sure

25:49.181 --> 25:53.619
Big L and Diamond don't let na'an

25:53.653 --> 25:55.621

25:55.655 --> 25:57.023

to bless our holy trinity.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.803

26:10.836 --> 26:14.040

28:43.956 --> 28:45.324
Don't nobody come back here.

28:59.371 --> 29:02.141

29:10.749 --> 29:13.486
How the fuck you think? I stole it.

29:27.366 --> 29:32.171
I figured you could use a few minutes away
from all that crazy up over there.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.407
That's awful kind.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.045

29:41.514 --> 29:43.449

29:43.482 --> 29:47.453

29:47.486 --> 29:49.355

30:10.543 --> 30:11.844
It's a big night for you.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.013
It's your debut performance.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.248
And, look, this could really set you up.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.983

30:18.017 --> 30:20.452

with it, don't it?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.383
You sure you okay?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.185
If you want to talk about it, you know...

30:53.219 --> 30:56.021
If I talk about it, then I won't be okay.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.556
And tonight I needs to be okay,

30:57.590 --> 31:00.426

31:01.327 --> 31:04.463
But tomorrow I probably won't be okay,

31:04.496 --> 31:07.600
and I will welcome your offer
to talk at that time.

31:09.101 --> 31:12.304
But tonight I'm okay.

33:07.753 --> 33:11.290
I will never clean house. Never!

33:11.323 --> 33:13.425
I'd rather wax

33:13.459 --> 33:15.394

33:15.427 --> 33:17.463
They think their shit don't stink.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.664
Could be worse.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.033
I'm finna go flip hash over at Taffe's.

With this casino coming,
I'm about to get me a job

33:29.241 --> 33:30.542

33:30.576 --> 33:33.178
Girl, they don't play
no spades at no casino.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.013
See there, this casino for white folk.

33:35.047 --> 33:37.149
It ain't even no spades tables.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.184
Y'all better be

33:39.218 --> 33:41.120

34:19.391 --> 34:22.294
I just don't understand
why she won't just leave.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.697
Because that's when they're
most likely to kill you.

34:27.332 --> 34:29.635
Sound like something you know personally.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.745
Last call for alcohol.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.146
I'll have another one.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.148
Hard day?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.517
Man, was it.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.854
But tomorrow can't be worse than today.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.406
Oh, I'm sorry, Diamond.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.174

35:28.694 --> 35:31.296

35:33.732 --> 35:37.369
Real talk, I can't believe
this moment came to me.

35:38.303 --> 35:41.273

the headliner at The Pynk.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.392
Diamond, what this is?

36:00.425 --> 36:03.395
This here carnelian.
One of them healing crystals.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.497
That one supposed to give you courage.

36:05.531 --> 36:08.400
Over in Iraq, one of my boys' girls
used to send 'em to him.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.270
He taught us 'bout it.

36:11.303 --> 36:12.905
He had it in his pocket when...

36:16.241 --> 36:18.710
...when, you know,

36:18.744 --> 36:21.680
he died saving me.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.383
I got it made out of what was left.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.755
It done gave me courage.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.758
Maybe it'll give you some.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.795
Put it on me?

37:00.319 --> 37:01.453
There you go.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.807
Thank you.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.718
Damn it!

37:32.751 --> 37:35.787
No-good pussy-eating son of a bitch!

37:35.821 --> 37:36.788
Gidget, what's wrong?

37:36.822 --> 37:39.424
Duffy ass just text me

37:39.458 --> 37:41.360
Talking about he got to make
a last-minute run.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.494
Fuck Alabama!

37:42.527 --> 37:44.630

37:44.663 --> 37:48.300
He think I'ma sit around

37:48.333 --> 37:50.936
Don't laugh at me, Keyshawn! Fuck!

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
I'm sexually frustrated.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.675

38:01.713 --> 38:04.349

38:37.816 --> 38:39.317

38:42.521 --> 38:44.890

'Cause I'm at your place.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.312
Where are you?
What's that noise in the background?

45:14.345 --> 45:17.182
I'm at the bar watching a game.

45:17.215 --> 45:19.284

46:39.130 --> 46:40.431
God damn, nigga!

46:40.465 --> 46:43.201
Why the hell you over there all quiet,
hiding in the shadows and shit?

46:43.234 --> 46:45.837
You learn to be quiet in the funeral home.

46:45.870 --> 46:47.539
Got to respect the dead.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.207
Yeah, whatever, man.

46:49.941 --> 46:51.376
Let's gon' slide up in there.

46:53.378 --> 46:54.846
We need to talk, LaMarques.

46:54.879 --> 46:57.549
Woddy, what'd I tell you
about using my government name, man?

46:59.350 --> 47:02.220
I saw you coming from down
by the river with you-know-who.

47:02.253 --> 47:04.422
You said that was
on some, like, one-time shit.

47:04.455 --> 47:05.423
It was.

47:07.292 --> 47:09.227
I don't get it, my dude.

47:10.361 --> 47:12.997
You got all these bitches
throwing they pussy at you.

47:13.932 --> 47:17.969
You got the exec coming over from Atlanta
to see you do your thing tonight,

47:18.002 --> 47:22.006
and you rolling round in the bushes
'cause you done caught feelings for a--

47:22.040 --> 47:23.408
Nigga, I ain't caught nothing.

47:28.079 --> 47:30.215
You know what I done heard before?

47:31.416 --> 47:34.419
When two people fall in love,
they hearts beat on beat with each other.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.256
That's attraction, man.

47:39.324 --> 47:43.895
It's on some chemical,
spiritual connect-type shit.

47:43.928 --> 47:46.064
Nigga, is you really giving me all this
right now...

47:46.097 --> 47:46.965
Look, man.

47:48.499 --> 47:51.069
I guess you like what you like,
and that's cool.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.905
Couldn't be me.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.608
But the heart want what the heart want.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.245
Can't control that.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.550
But what you can control

48:05.583 --> 48:07.485
is how many folks know
'bout what you doing

48:07.518 --> 48:09.120
in the dark at The Pynk,

48:10.154 --> 48:11.589
'cause your heart ain't
gon' get in the way

48:11.623 --> 48:13.524

48:29.440 --> 48:31.409
and I must have, because your ass
was nowhere to be found.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.344
Why weren't you answering your cell phone?

48:33.378 --> 48:34.612
- I...
- I know it wasn't because

48:34.646 --> 48:36.414
you was with your god-daddy,
because I called him,

48:36.447 --> 48:37.949
and he had no idea where you were.

48:37.982 --> 48:38.950
So who are you fucking, huh?

48:38.983 --> 48:40.451
There's not anybody
to cheat on you here with.

48:40.485 --> 48:42.086
So if there were, you'd do it, huh?

48:42.120 --> 48:44.122
You know what, Britney?
Just shut the fuck up.

48:45.089 --> 48:46.190
What?

48:46.224 --> 48:48.393
I said shut...

48:49.494 --> 48:52.563
...the fuck up.

49:00.271 --> 49:01.272
You quiet now, huh?

49:04.008 --> 49:06.411
Good. Now take off your dress.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.112
Andre, stop.

49:08.146 --> 49:09.514
You don't want to take it off?

49:10.715 --> 49:11.649
Cool then.

49:50.054 --> 49:52.156
Don't run from me. Don't run from me.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.391
Andre!

49:54.559 --> 49:57.195
Andre! Fuck.

49:57.228 --> 49:58.463
Andre!

49:58.496 --> 50:00.565
Andre, fuck!

50:21.119 --> 50:22.420
You missed me, didn't you?

50:24.489 --> 50:26.057
I'ma go take this shower.

50:34.599 --> 50:37.034
Wall to wall up in here, y'all!

50:37.068 --> 50:38.136
Don't be scared.

50:38.169 --> 50:39.737
Throw them stacks at these bitches.

50:39.771 --> 50:43.741
We finna ball till our casket fall.

50:43.775 --> 50:45.109

51:02.827 --> 51:04.295
Hey, partner.

51:05.129 --> 51:07.465
You looking awful lonely
over here all by yourself.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.436
I'm cool.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.314
Appreciate the offer, lil' mama.

51:28.419 --> 51:33.424
But I got my heart set
on something else tonight.

51:39.664 --> 51:42.333
Oh, you want my girl Autumn?

52:11.863 --> 52:14.532
Autumn, this gentleman wants
to be taken to Paradise.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.201
Yeah, Autumn.

52:19.704 --> 52:21.706
Willing to pay more when I get there.

52:25.376 --> 52:28.312
Girl, go get them stacks.

52:48.900 --> 52:50.301

52:52.403 --> 52:54.238
Coach.

52:54.272 --> 52:55.873

52:55.907 --> 52:57.241
Girl, you kidding?

52:58.509 --> 53:00.344
You ain't gon' on yet, did you?

53:02.747 --> 53:03.748
Cedes?

53:04.615 --> 53:08.619
Look, I'm glad you came,
but this ain't 'bout my last dance.

53:08.653 --> 53:09.787
It's about business.

54:59.530 --> 55:02.400

looking for you.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.675

55:16.480 --> 55:19.517
