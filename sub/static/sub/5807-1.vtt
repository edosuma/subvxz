IT SEEMS
YOU COLLEGE KIDS,

30:29.083 --> 30:31.291
YOU HAVE A REAL KNACK
FOR GOING WACKO.

30:31.291 --> 30:37.083
THEY HAVE A RULE THAT IF
YOUR ROOMMATE KILLS HIMSELF,

30:37.083 --> 30:39.583
YOU GET STRAIGHT As.
YEAH, THEY DO.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.917
IT'S LIKE
A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

30:43.917 --> 30:46.125
YEAH, IT RELIEVES
TENSION OR SOMETHING.

30:46.125 --> 30:50.792
MY INTESTINES ARE
OVER 2 MILES LONG.

30:50.792 --> 30:52.959
IS THAT TRUE?
Drunk: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.208
NO, NO, NO.
THE RULES.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.333
MMM. YES.
YES.

30:56.333 --> 30:59.001
OH, OK, WELL, YEAH,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

30:59.001 --> 31:01.166
YOU CAN'T BE
EXPECTED TO STUDY

31:01.166 --> 31:04.625
IF YOU'RE GRIEVING
FOR YOUR DEAD ROOMMATE.

31:04.625 --> 31:07.834
I KNOW I COULDN'T STUDY
IF YOU DIED.

31:07.834 --> 31:10.125
YOU CAN'T STUDY NOW.

31:10.125 --> 31:12.208
SO THESE RULES, THEY GOT THEM
WRITTEN DOWN SOMEWHERE?

31:12.208 --> 31:13.667
PROBABLY THE LIBRARY.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.709
THE LIBRARY, JOSH.

31:15.709 --> 31:17.125
YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS,
DON'T YOU?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.667
TAKE ME TO THE LIBRARY.

31:20.875 --> 31:22.875
THIS MUST BE
A GREAT COLLEGE

31:22.875 --> 31:24.166
TO HAVE
ALL THESE BOOKS.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.959
SHH.

31:25.959 --> 31:27.917
[WHISPERING]
How are we gonna find
that charter?

31:27.917 --> 31:30.333
HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND
OUR WAY OUT OF HERE?

31:30.333 --> 31:32.041
WILL YOU GROW UP?

31:32.041 --> 31:33.542
[SIGHS]

31:33.542 --> 31:34.709
HERE IT IS.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.041
OH, YOU...
YOU FOUND IT.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.001
WOW. THE COLLEGE CHARTER.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.166
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND STUDY, SO HAVE FUN.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.959
WAIT A MINUTE.
AREN'T YOU EVEN CURIOUS?

31:47.959 --> 31:50.083
NO.
IT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

31:50.083 --> 31:52.625
DON'T LEAVE ME
DOWN HERE ALONE.

31:52.625 --> 31:55.125
LIBRARIES
GIVE ME THE CREEPS.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.041
"EACH STUDENT WHO..."

31:58.041 --> 31:59.291
HMM...

31:59.291 --> 32:00.834
WHAT THE...

32:00.834 --> 32:02.834
HOLY SHIT!

32:02.834 --> 32:06.209
HOLY SHIT!
J--LISTEN.

32:06.209 --> 32:07.875
UH, "A STUDENT
FOUND TO HAVE DIED

32:07.875 --> 32:10.667
"AS A RESULT OF HIS OWN
WILLFUL ACT WILL...

32:10.667 --> 32:13.250
"ANY OTHER STUDENT RESIDING
IN THE SAME HOUSING UNIT

32:13.250 --> 32:15.500
"OF SAID STUDENTS

32:15.500 --> 32:16.834
"OF THE HIGHEST ORDER

32:16.834 --> 32:18.792
REGARDLESS
OF ACADEMIC STANDING."

32:18.792 --> 32:20.625
WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS MEAN?
IS THIS IT?

32:20.625 --> 32:24.083
THAT'S IT.
OH, HO HO.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:25.458 --> 32:27.542
WELL, WE'VE GOT
TO COPY THIS.

32:27.542 --> 32:28.792
FOR PROOF.

32:28.792 --> 32:30.750
Cooper:
JOSH! OH, HEY, JOSH!

32:30.750 --> 32:32.750
Person: SHH!
Boy: SHUT UP!

32:32.750 --> 32:34.083
JOSH, WHERE YOU GOING?

32:34.083 --> 32:36.041
LOOK, JOSH, I FINISHED.
I FINISHED COPYING.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.333
IT WASN'T REALLY
THAT HARD.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.583
Person:
SHH!

32:38.583 --> 32:40.000
WOW. LOOK AT ALL
THESE PEOPLE.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.417
SHH!

32:41.417 --> 32:42.917
[WHISPERING]
Right.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.417
[SIGHS]

32:52.083 --> 32:53.834
I'M NOT GONNA KILL MYSELF,

32:53.834 --> 32:55.333
IN CASE THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WONDERING.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.458
COME ON.
BE A SPORT.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.959
I MEAN, YOU'RE FUCKED ANYWAY.
AT LEAST THIS WAY,

32:59.959 --> 33:01.875
ONE OF US
COMES OUT ON TOP.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.083
THEN YOU KILL YOURSELF.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.542
NO, I CAN'T SEE THAT
WORKING.

33:05.542 --> 33:06.875
LOOK, JUST FORGET IT.

33:06.875 --> 33:08.917
JOSH, PLEASE. ALL I'M
ASKING YOU TO DO--

33:08.917 --> 33:10.166
I'M DONE HELPING YOU.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.625
People:
SHH! QUIET!

33:11.625 --> 33:14.083
JOSH, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT KYLE?

33:14.083 --> 33:15.333
WHO'S KYLE?

33:15.333 --> 33:17.083
KYLE, OUR OTHER ROOMMATE.

33:17.083 --> 33:18.625
THE ONE FROM
THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

33:18.625 --> 33:21.166
HE COULD KILL HIMSELF.
IT'S PERFECT.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.083
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT MURDER, COOPER?

33:23.083 --> 33:25.000
'CAUSE IF YOU ARE,
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.917
NO, I AM NOT
TALKING ABOUT MURDER.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.166
WELL, I DON'T
WANT TO BE PART

33:28.166 --> 33:29.875
OF YOUR STUPID PLAN,
SO JUST DROP IT.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.125
IT'S SIMPLE.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.166
NO, I MEAN IT.
JUST SHUT THE SHIT UP.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.458
YEAH, BUT ALL YOU--

33:34.458 --> 33:36.041
AW. HO HO HO.

33:36.041 --> 33:39.709
SUICIDAL IMPULSES
COME FROM FEELING POWERLESS

33:39.709 --> 33:41.834
OVER ONE'S PROBLEMS.

33:41.834 --> 33:44.083
SO WHEN SOMEONE
CALLS DALEMAN'S HOTLINE,

33:44.083 --> 33:48.917
WE MAKE SURE THAT THE CALLER
FEELS IN CONTROL OF THE--

33:48.917 --> 33:51.583
YOUNG MAN, WOULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT?

33:53.583 --> 33:55.625
NOW, THE CALLER
SHOULD BE TOLD

33:55.625 --> 33:58.959
THAT SUICIDE
IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

33:58.959 --> 34:00.667
SAY THERE'S SOMEONE
REALLY DEPRESSED--

34:00.667 --> 34:02.875
COULD YOU RAISE YOUR HAND?

34:02.875 --> 34:06.000
WELL, YEAH. OK.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.542
SAY THERE'S SOMEONE
REALLY DEPRESSED,

34:07.542 --> 34:09.375
BUT HE MIGHT NOT
ACTUALLY KILL HIMSELF.

34:09.375 --> 34:12.708
WHY DON'T I ANSWER QUESTIONS
AFTER THE SESSION?

34:12.708 --> 34:14.458
WHAT WOULD PUSH HIM
OVER THE EDGE?

34:14.458 --> 34:16.291
SEND HIM RUNNING
FOR THE RAZORS?

34:16.291 --> 34:17.583
ANYTHING
COME TO MIND?

34:17.583 --> 34:19.333
WHAT?

34:20.833 --> 34:22.208
OH, HI, JOSH.
COME ON IN.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.667
I GOT A NOTE.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

34:24.667 --> 34:26.250
I JUST WANTED TO
CHECK UP ON YOU,

34:26.250 --> 34:28.875
MAKE SURE YOUR HEAD'S
STILL ABOVE WATER.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.041
WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
I DID ON MY MIDTERMS.

34:31.041 --> 34:33.708
I WAS DISTRACTED,

34:33.708 --> 34:36.250
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
BUT STUDY FROM HERE ON OUT.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.458
JUST REMEMBER YOU HAVE
TO KEEP A "B" PLUS AVERAGE

34:38.458 --> 34:41.250
TO KEEP YOUR SCHOLARSHIP.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.500
WHAT?

34:42.500 --> 34:44.250
YOU MUST KEEP
A "B" PLUS AVERAGE,

34:44.250 --> 34:45.958
OR THEY'LL REVOKE
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP.

34:45.958 --> 34:49.375
NO, NOT MY SCHOLARSHIP.
I MEAN, THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.833
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I NEED THAT SCHOLARSHIP.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.833
JOSH, THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET SO WORKED UP.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.750
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AS IF
YOU FAILED YOUR MIDTERMS.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.250
HI, HONEY.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.250
WHAT?

35:08.542 --> 35:11.417
WELL, THANK YOU, SHIRLEY.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

35:11.417 --> 35:12.834
YES, I'LL LET YOU KNOW

35:12.834 --> 35:14.709
IF THE DOCTOR
NEEDS THOSE FILES.

35:14.709 --> 35:16.542
ALL RIGHT.
TELL ME, WHAT--

35:16.542 --> 35:18.250
HEY!

35:18.250 --> 35:20.125
THAT WAS RUDE.

35:20.125 --> 35:23.917
WOW, JOSH.
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

35:23.917 --> 35:26.209
WHY SHOULD I LOOK GOOD?

35:26.209 --> 35:28.125
THESE ARE
MY MIDTERM SCORES.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.750
AND THESE ARE THE SCORES

35:29.750 --> 35:31.709
THAT I WOULD NEED
TO GET ON MY FINALS

35:31.709 --> 35:33.458
IN ORDER TO KEEP
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.875
AND THERE'S NO MATHEMATICAL WAY
THAT I CAN GET THESE SCORES.

35:36.875 --> 35:40.166
I WOULD NEED
4 "A" PLUS PLUS PLUSES.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.417
I'M DOOMED!

35:41.417 --> 35:43.458
WHAT'S THIS DOING HERE?

35:43.458 --> 35:44.750
WELL, SEE, I--

35:44.750 --> 35:47.834
COOPER, WHEN I GOT HERE,
I WAS ON A TRACK.

35:47.834 --> 35:51.667
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
A TRACK IS? CHALK.

35:51.667 --> 35:55.875
A TRACK IS A BEAUTIFUL,
WONDERFUL THING.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.709
IT'S A GOAL.
IT'S A TRACK.

35:57.709 --> 36:01.709
IT'S ALWAYS MOVING FORWARD
ON A TRACK.

36:01.709 --> 36:05.291
WELL, I DON'T HAVE A TRACK.

36:05.291 --> 36:07.875
I HAVE NOTHING.
I'M DEAD.

36:07.875 --> 36:10.166
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
AT A DEAD MAN.

36:10.166 --> 36:13.709
WELL, THEN YOU'RE IN!

36:13.709 --> 36:15.333
I MEAN, THIS IS GREAT.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.709
GREAT?

36:16.709 --> 36:19.083
WELL, I'M JUST SAYING--
COOPER!

36:19.083 --> 36:20.417
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

36:20.417 --> 36:21.834
YOU TAKE THE CAKE!

36:21.834 --> 36:25.041
COOPER! DO YOU KNOW
THAT COOPER? UHH!

36:25.041 --> 36:28.291
OHH! OHH.

36:28.291 --> 36:30.875
YOU'RE OK.
YOU'RE OK, HUH?

36:30.875 --> 36:33.000
HUH? JUST SHAKE IT OFF.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.291
UHH.

36:34.291 --> 36:35.834
NOW, WE HAVE A WAY OUT,

36:35.834 --> 36:37.417
AND IT'S THE BEST
LOOPHOLE EVER,

36:37.417 --> 36:39.542
AND IT'S GONNA SAVE
BOTH OF OUR ASSES,

36:39.542 --> 36:41.000
SO JUST MELLOW.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.417
HERE, PUT THIS ON YOUR NOSE.
AH, COOPER.

36:43.417 --> 36:46.875
NO. MY WHOLE VISION
IS RIGHT HERE...

36:46.875 --> 36:48.166
ON THIS BLACKBOARD.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.917
IN WHAT LANGUAGE?

36:49.917 --> 36:52.959
WELL, MY PENMANSHIP'S
KIND OF GONE TO SHIT,

36:52.959 --> 36:55.250
BUT BASICALLY,
HERE IS MR. Z.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.625
WHO'S MR. Z?

36:56.625 --> 37:00.417
MR. Z IS THE MOST
SUICIDAL GUY ON CAMPUS.

37:00.417 --> 37:02.333
MR. Z IS THE GUY
WHO'S GONNA KILL HIMSELF

37:02.333 --> 37:03.667
WHETHER HE LIVES
WITH US OR NOT,

37:03.667 --> 37:05.250
SO I FIGURE, HE MIGHT
AS WELL LIVE WITH US

37:05.250 --> 37:06.667
SO HIS DEATH
WON'T BE IN VAIN.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.583
NOW, WE FIND HIM AT
THE MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC,

37:08.583 --> 37:10.625
HE MOVES IN,
HE KILLS HIMSELF,

37:10.625 --> 37:13.167
AND HERE'S YOU KEEPING
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP,

37:13.167 --> 37:15.000
AND HERE'S ME SAYING,
"FLUSH OFF, FLUSHLES."

37:15.000 --> 37:16.709
HA HA HA HA.

37:16.709 --> 37:19.667
LOOK, I HAVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH
WITHOUT YOU MIND-FUCKING ME.

37:19.667 --> 37:23.083
NO, JOSH. I AM NOT
MIND-FUCKING YOU, OK?

37:23.083 --> 37:26.333
I AM SO DEAD SERIOUS.
I AM, LIKE, IN THE ZONE.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.792
COME ON, JOSH!
OH, JOSH.

37:28.792 --> 37:30.333
OH, JOSH.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.250
OK, THE BOTTOM LINE IS

37:33.250 --> 37:34.917
YOU WORK IN
THE HOUSING OFFICE.

37:34.917 --> 37:37.417
I NEED YOU. I CAN'T
DO IT WITHOUT YOU,

37:37.417 --> 37:38.667
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE IT A GO.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.208
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO LOSE?

37:40.208 --> 37:43.041
FORGET IT, COOPER. YOUR BRAIN
IS PERMANENTLY FRIED.

37:43.041 --> 37:46.209
YOU NEED HELP. I WOULD
NEVER IN A BAJILLION YEARS

37:46.209 --> 37:49.000
FOLLOW YOU ON SOME IDIOTIC
WILD-GOOSE CHASE! NEVER!

37:49.000 --> 37:51.583
SAY NO MORE.
I UNDERSTAND, OK?

37:51.583 --> 37:52.959
OH, BY THE WAY,

37:52.959 --> 37:55.250
THERE'S A MESSAGE
FOR YOU ON THE MACHINE.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.417
I THINK IT'S YOUR MOM.

37:58.583 --> 38:00.333
[BEEP]

38:00.333 --> 38:01.875
HI, JOSHIE, IT'S MOM.

38:01.875 --> 38:04.166
YOU SOUNDED SO WORRIED
WHEN I TALKED TO YOU.

38:04.166 --> 38:06.709
LISTEN, HONEY, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

38:06.709 --> 38:08.542
I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU'LL
DO WELL IN COLLEGE.

38:08.542 --> 38:11.750
YOU ALWAYS SURPASS
MY EXPECTATIONS.

38:11.750 --> 38:16.167
AND I EXPECT TO SEE
STRAIGHT As. OK? BYE.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.375
WHO IS MR. Z AGAIN?

38:17.375 --> 38:20.375
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

38:20.375 --> 38:22.291
THERE'S ONE.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

38:22.291 --> 38:24.583
OH, YEAH.
COME ON, BABY.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.375
OH, COME TO DADDY.

38:26.375 --> 38:28.250
OH, I GOTCHA. I GOTCHA.
DADDY'S GOTCHA.

38:28.250 --> 38:31.917
JOSH, YOU'RE NOT
SAYING ANYTHING.

38:31.917 --> 38:33.166
YAY. YIPPEE.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.417
COME ON,
THIS IS GONNA BE EASY.

38:34.417 --> 38:36.041
ONCE WE FIND OUT
WHO THESE GUYS ARE,

38:36.041 --> 38:37.917
WE'LL STEAL THEIR FILES,
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT

38:37.917 --> 38:39.709
WHICH ONE'S THE MOST
SUICIDAL OF THEM ALL.

38:39.709 --> 38:43.917
OH, YEAH. THIS GUY
LOOKS REALLY DEPRESSED.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.000
YEAH.
THIS GUY LOOKS TROUBLED.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.875
COOPER?
JOSH, IS THAT YOU?

38:47.875 --> 38:49.834
HOO!

38:51.625 --> 38:53.000
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.709
CAN WE HAVE SOME
PRIVACY, PLEASE?

38:56.709 --> 38:58.458
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.

38:58.458 --> 38:59.709
YEAH.

38:59.709 --> 39:01.709
OH.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.542
WOW, THAT WAS CLOSE.

39:03.542 --> 39:06.542
COOPER, THEY PROBABLY THINK
THAT WE'RE MAKING OUT BACK HERE.

39:06.542 --> 39:08.834
I KNOW. THEY'RE TOTALLY
IN THE DARK.

39:19.542 --> 39:20.792
Josh:
OOH!

39:20.792 --> 39:22.125
Cooper:
JOSH!

39:22.125 --> 39:23.458
Josh:
WHERE WE GOING?

39:33.500 --> 39:34.750
