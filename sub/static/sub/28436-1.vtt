<i>There are moments in our
lives that seem to define us.</i>

01:44.080 --> 01:46.674
<i>Moments we keep going back to.</i>

01:49.880 --> 01:53.669
<i>My life before him
was so simple and decided.</i>

01:56.480 --> 01:57.959
<i>And now, after him,</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:00.399
<i>there's just...</i>

02:02.680 --> 02:03.715
<i>After.</i>

02:42.480 --> 02:43.480
Tessa!

02:49.400 --> 02:51.755
Okay, what are we forgetting?

02:53.360 --> 02:54.509
Hair dryer?
No.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.278
Flashlight.
Mom, it's college.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.873
It's not a survival course.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.599
Towels, battery charger,
phone charger...

03:03.680 --> 03:05.956
I can always drive anything
up if you forget it.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.269
Okay, we should get going.
We have a long drive ahead.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.914
Okay.
Let's do a last-minute room check.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.549
Oh, wait.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.835
<i>Mom.
Thanks, baby.</i>

03:26.880 --> 03:28.553
<i>Get me to the sunshine</i>

03:28.760 --> 03:31.229
<i>I wanna see the water
with my own eyes</i>

03:31.320 --> 03:33.072
<i>You know I like that</i>

03:34.600 --> 03:36.113
<i>Yeah, I like that</i>

03:37.560 --> 03:39.631
<i>Get a taste of the good life</i>

03:40.040 --> 03:42.429
<i>Go a little wild on the inside</i>

03:42.560 --> 03:44.551
<i>And never look back</i>

03:45.360 --> 03:46.919
<i>You know I like that</i>

03:48.600 --> 03:52.230
<i>I wanna feel
feel something good</i>

03:52.640 --> 03:54.790
<i>Feel something good</i>

03:54.920 --> 03:57.753
<i>Feel, feel something good</i>

03:59.800 --> 04:03.111
We're on the right floor.
B-22...

04:03.840 --> 04:05.035
B-22...

04:05.760 --> 04:08.274
B-22.
Twenty-two.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.670
Hey.
Hi.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.630
Um...

04:25.720 --> 04:27.836
Steph?
In the flesh.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.030
I'm Tessa.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.839
Hey, it's my new roomie.
This is Tristan.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.109
Hey.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.909
I'm Tessa.
Come in. We're not gonna bite.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.437
Sorry. So, this is my mom,
and this is Noah.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.393
Hello.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.189
Full disclosure,

04:51.280 --> 04:53.271
I was pretty bummed to be
paired with a freshman,

04:53.360 --> 04:56.000
but then I thought,
"Hello, bright side,

04:56.120 --> 04:57.840
"I'm gonna be your
spirit guide."

04:58.560 --> 05:00.119
We can get you into
all the best places,

05:00.120 --> 05:01.519
even without a fake.
No problem.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.394
Mom.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.075
I like your sweater.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.916
Thanks. I got it from The Gap.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.475
Cute.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.915
We're going straight down to
the housing office right now

05:30.000 --> 05:32.560
and requesting a room change.
What are you talking about?

05:33.880 --> 05:37.589
That room reeked of...
Can you please not make a scene?

05:38.920 --> 05:40.035
I'm not.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.719
Okay. We have worked
too hard for this...

05:41.720 --> 05:44.997
And I don't want you
to be distracted by anyone.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.471
Mom, this is me that we're
talking about.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.557
Can you please just trust me?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.912
It will be fine, I promise.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.069
I promise.

05:58.960 --> 05:59.995
Guys. Wait up.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.397
The house is gonna be
so empty without you.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.869
I know. I'll miss you.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.111
Oh, God, I am so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.193
<i>Okay. Hove you,
my baby.</i>

06:19.120 --> 06:21.873
I'm going. See you later.
Bye.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
I got it.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.078
This is the part I've been dreading.
Me too.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.440
I was actually talking about
the ride home with your mom.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.753
Mmm. Okay.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.676
How much did I
freak your mom out?

07:19.160 --> 07:20.160
Um...

07:21.200 --> 07:22.760
She thinks I'm gonna be
a bad influence?

07:23.480 --> 07:25.073
She's just very protective.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.190
It's always only been
the two of us.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.669
No. No thanks.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.470
See? Seems like she has
nothing to worry about.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.353
Your brother's cute.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.680
Oh, you mean Noah?
No, he's my boyfriend.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.678
Sorry.
No, it's okay.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.357
He's a senior in high school.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.792
That's Tristan.
I'm supposed to meet her.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.273
What's with all the old books?
Who brings books to college?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.110
Me. I guess.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.677
The bookish vibe.
I like that.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.756
All right, I'm out.
Okay. Bye.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.155
Hi. Hey.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.516
Econ 101?
Yeah.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.871
It's locked. Yeah.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.798
I already tried it.
Right.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.918
Couple of early birds, huh?

09:04.520 --> 09:05.555
Have fun in there.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.680
Oh.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.114
Sorry. After you.
After you.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
No, no...
No, no...

09:10.840 --> 09:12.433
Honestly. I insist.
No, I insist.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.999
No, honestly...
No, my mother raised me to...

09:14.000 --> 09:15.070
Okay.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.431
Are you in first year, too?
Yeah.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.754
Are you an econ major?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.916
That's the plan. You?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.280
I'm an English major.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.200
I'm Landon, by the way.
Tessa. Hi.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.475
Hi, nice to meet you.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.440
Good morning.
I'm Professor Alexander,

09:44.280 --> 09:46.715
and welcome to Econ 101.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.520
This might be the most
important class you take here,

09:50.000 --> 09:54.153
so I expect everyone here
to closely pay attention

09:54.280 --> 09:58.069
and benefit from the 25-year
career I had on Wall Street.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.279
Now, let's get started.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.630
Oh.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.869
Uh, excuse me?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.874
Uh, I think that
you're in the wrong room.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.594
I'm in the right room.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.438
How did you even get in here?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.999
Okay. Can you please
go out into the hall

10:50.080 --> 10:52.754
so I can get dressed?
Don't flatter yourself.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.080
I'm not looking.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.315
You took your time.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.070
There they are. Hey, Tessa.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.155
Hi. Uh...

11:07.240 --> 11:08.560
Can you please
ask your boyfriend

11:08.640 --> 11:10.233
to leave so I can
get dressed?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.520
Uh... Not my boyfriend.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.193
What did you say to her?
Nothing.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.358
I've been minding my own business.
Okay, well, whoever he is...

11:21.640 --> 11:22.960
You're going out
with us tonight.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.200
Yeah, I don't know.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.157
I'm trying to picture
this one at a party.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.829
Just not seeing it.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.835
You're not gonna
stay in here forever, right?

11:37.920 --> 11:39.115
Nope.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.394
<i>The Great Gatsby.
It's a good book.</i>

11:52.440 --> 11:53.794
I'd hate to spoil it...

11:56.080 --> 11:57.434
But it was all a dream.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.075
Actually...

12:04.480 --> 12:06.118
It was all a lie.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.789
Hello. Can I
get a cappuccino

12:29.880 --> 12:32.269
with almond milk
and cinnamon on top?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.480
Sure thing. I'll have a
regular black coffee, please.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.636
- And for you?
- Can I have an Americano, please?

12:37.360 --> 12:38.475
No prob.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.077
- Thanks.
- You're such a player.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.473
Now pick it up nicely.
Thank you.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.280
You're picking us
all up, right, Zed?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.879
- When am I picking you guys up tonight?
- I don't know, 8:00?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.109
We're raging tonight!

13:16.720 --> 13:18.199
Guess what?
Shh.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.232
We're gonna go
to a party tonight.

13:24.920 --> 13:25.990
I don't know.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.275
You're going.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.040
Don't you want to have fun?

13:31.800 --> 13:32.915
You shh.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.679
Yeah, of course I do.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.672
Then grab your shit.
Steph.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.920
Okay.
Let's get ready to party!

13:51.760 --> 13:53.717
<i>I put my shoes on first</i>

13:55.160 --> 13:57.037
<i>Rock down the street in reverse</i>

13:58.160 --> 14:00.071
<i>I paint a face on the clouds</i>

14:00.760 --> 14:01.830
What do you think?

14:03.840 --> 14:06.593
It's pretty.
What?

14:10.280 --> 14:12.157
Maybe it's just...

14:13.840 --> 14:15.877
A little too formal?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.594
You said be myself.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.952
You know what? I love it.
I love it.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.954
This is gonna get crazy.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.519
Hey!
Hey. What's up?

14:41.600 --> 14:43.034
Chug, chug, chug!

14:43.120 --> 14:44.633
Ooh. Chug, chug, chug.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.519
There's my baby.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.755
Hey, I'm not done.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.193
Hi, Tessa.
Hi.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.350
I need things to be
way less in focus.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.993
- Do that again, do it again.
- Do it again? I'm dying over here.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.669
I've lost my touch.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.194
Hey, guys-

15:24.120 --> 15:26.509
This is my new roommate,
Tessa.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.520
This is everybody.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.915
Nice to meet you.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.230
- My name is Zed.
- You've met Hardin.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.913
Hey.
That's Molly.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.520
Wanna sit down?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.474
Cute dress.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.272
Oh. Yeah, and that's Jace,
the townie.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.069
What's up?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.114
What's your major, Tessa?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.479
Um, I'm thinking business
or maybe economics.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.515
Very cool.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.674
You want a drink?

16:00.280 --> 16:01.554
I don't really drink.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.756
Come on, we're all drinking.
Just have a drink.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.477
Do it. Come on.
Just a small one.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.680
Oh, my God, Steph,
where'd you find this girl?

16:11.560 --> 16:12.880
No one's talking to you.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.840
Whoa!

16:15.520 --> 16:16.874
Yes!

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
That was good.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.069
Babe, kiss.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.397
Cheers to that.
You okay?

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Babe.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.909
Ooh, baby.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.149
You're so pretty.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.116
<i>Okay, so, um, guys...</i>

16:34.280 --> 16:35.350
Truth or dare.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.158
What?
Truth or dare.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.833
Come on.
No, no!

16:38.920 --> 16:39.955
Isn't this a kids' game?

16:41.280 --> 16:42.475
Not the way we play.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.189
Hey, Tessa, truth or dare?

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
Truth.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.879
Craziest place
you've had sex?

16:54.400 --> 16:57.597
Um... Pass.
Why? It's an easy one.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.835
Wait.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.434
Are you a virgin?

17:13.160 --> 17:14.355
I'll do a dare.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.679
Dare.
Wait, is she really a virgin?

17:15.680 --> 17:18.069
I dare you to
make out with Hardin.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.795
She won't do it.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.628
This never ends well.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.435
Do you want to do this?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.080
You having fun, Molly?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.633
I'm done playing this game.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.429
Sucks to suck!

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
I like this girl.

18:03.840 --> 18:07.595
Oh, Hardin Scott
got his first rejection.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.309
Denied, bro.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.715
Hey. <i>Hey. Thought we
were gonna Face Time.</i>

18:24.840 --> 18:26.353
Yeah, sorry.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.751
<i>Where are you right now?
It's really loud.</i>

18:29.840 --> 18:31.160
Um...

18:31.240 --> 18:33.914
I'm with Steph
and her friends,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.879
but they're all just, like...

18:38.080 --> 18:40.959
- I don't know.
- So, uh, you're at a party?

18:41.040 --> 18:43.429
Have you been drinking?
I just had one drink.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.672
<i>Okay, so you go
to college and now you drink.</i>

18:46.760 --> 18:48.319
<i>That's really great, Tessa.</i>

18:49.040 --> 18:50.758
Noah, can you
not be so, like...

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
<i>"So, like" What?</i>

18:51.920 --> 18:53.359
<i>I'm not the one who's
out partying right now.</i>

18:53.360 --> 18:55.476
- Just forget it.
<i>- Tessa, I wanna...</i>

19:01.000 --> 19:02.035
My bad.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.034
What are you doing?
Hmm?

20:04.640 --> 20:05.675
Nothing.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.389
You looking for something?

20:12.200 --> 20:13.520
Are you drunk?

20:14.440 --> 20:15.510
I don't drink.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.314
Just like you don't.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.232
"He's more myself than I am.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.031
"Whatever our souls
are made of..."

20:31.040 --> 20:32.599
"his and mine are the same."

20:35.720 --> 20:38.075
It's Bronté, Theresa.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.479
I know it's Bronté.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.838
And my name is Tessa.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.797
What are you doing
in my room, Tessa?

20:57.200 --> 20:58.349
Your room?

20:59.440 --> 21:00.475
Yes.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.440
Are we still playing?

21:20.360 --> 21:22.351
'Cause I think
you owe me a dare.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.310
Wait.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.435
I can't.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.800
I need to go.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.195
I've got this. Look, look, look.
Here we go. Ready?

22:08.280 --> 22:10.874
Oh! Good shot, right?

22:11.440 --> 22:13.590
- You got this.
- All right, all right.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.992
Hey.
Hi.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.880
I'm glad I'm not the only
freshman in this class.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.638
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm psyched I got in.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.040
All right, folks.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.434
Let's get started.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.952
Jane Austen's masterpiece.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.070
Who in here has already read
<i>Pride and Prejudice?</i>

23:50.680 --> 23:52.520
And what did you think of it
on the first read?

23:54.520 --> 23:57.911
Let's hear from our
newcomer, Mr. Scott.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.559
<i>Pride and Prejudice?</i>

24:03.160 --> 24:04.878
Elizabeth Bennet
needs to chill.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.480
She gave Darcy a way
worse time than he deserved.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.115
Are you saying that Darcy
was not in love with Elizabeth?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.996
Love is just a transaction.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.278
We're all hardwired
to desire.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.231
We present the correct set
of desirable traits, and boom.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.038
We can turn it on,
and we can turn it off.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.874
Yes, Miss, um...
Young, Tessa.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.793
I think that it was the most
revolutionary feminist novel

24:37.960 --> 24:39.712
that I'd ever read.

24:40.080 --> 24:43.391
That a woman of that era would
have the strength to reject Darcy

24:43.480 --> 24:45.391
when he treated her poorly.
That's a load.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.280
It was Darcy's
very attitude

24:51.360 --> 24:52.873
that attracted
Elizabeth to him.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.917
Darcy's attitude was rude
and mocking.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.720
I think that he was lucky
to be with a woman

24:56.800 --> 24:58.119
with as much integrity
as Elizabeth.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.077
The only reason he even
asked her to marry him

25:00.200 --> 25:01.599
was she wouldn't
stop throwing herself...

25:01.600 --> 25:03.398
Throwing herself at him?

25:03.720 --> 25:06.473
He was pursuing her. She's clearly
not satisfied with her life

25:06.560 --> 25:08.479
and is looking for excitement
wherever she can get it.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.790
Well, I think that it's
obviously all in his head

25:10.880 --> 25:12.951
that she had any feelings
for him at all.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.077
Well, there you have it.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.711
That's the power
of a good book.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.630
That was exciting.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.599
No, it was annoying.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.636
I enjoyed it.
Look, whatever you're thinking,

25:33.040 --> 25:34.075
don't.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.954
Nothing happened between us,
okay? I have a boyfriend.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.029
Us? I thought we were talking
about <i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

25:48.440 --> 25:49.794
Hey. Uh...

25:50.360 --> 25:52.112
Do you want to
go get some coffee?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.277
How can someone
be so arrogant?

25:55.560 --> 25:57.676
Oh. "Elizabeth Bennet
needs to chill."

25:57.760 --> 26:00.400
Like, who even...
Who even says that?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.553
That's just Hardin
being Hardin.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.119
You know him?
Yeah.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.479
We're, uh...
We're practically related.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.836
My mom is dating
Chancellor Scott.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.116
Chancellor Scott
is Hardin's dad.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.040
And Hardin and I,

26:20.120 --> 26:22.839
we tolerate each other,
but barely.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.512
His father's the chancellor?

26:26.640 --> 26:27.755
Yeah.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.637
Listen, Tessa,

26:33.720 --> 26:35.080
he's just trying
to get a reaction.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.953
Well,
he's not gonna get one from me.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.280
Hmm, hmm.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.479
It actually does hurt.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.870
You should get one.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.916
My mom would
literally kill me.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.599
You need to get this.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.074
I bet she'd love that one.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.198
Yeah, dice.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.674
I feel like my mom has
everything planned out for me.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.672
Like, I think she's been
planning my wedding to Noah

27:13.760 --> 27:15.831
since we were five.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.394
Wait, is Noah the only dude
you've ever gone out with?

27:23.200 --> 27:24.315
That's sad.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
Ooh. Ouch!

27:30.680 --> 27:31.829
Watch it.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.394
Yeah, you guys really
aren't selling me on this.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.997
You look so good tonight.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.158
Can I get
a small coffee, please?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.235
Here you go.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Yeah. Thanks.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.795
Hi.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.315
Hi.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.113
I can't stay away from you.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.400
What?

28:54.640 --> 28:56.756
Well, we're gonna
see each other.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.430
I'm friends with Steph,
and you're roommates.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.719
Tessa, let's just
start over.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.795
Just reset and we can be...
What, friends?

29:09.240 --> 29:10.435
Well, why not?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.240
I want to show
you something.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.874
So, show me, then.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.510
It's a... It's a place.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.118
I think that it's better
if we keep our distance.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.315
I'll see you around.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.274
It's down this way.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
Come on.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.318
Welcome to
my favorite place.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.273
It's beautiful.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.429
How about a swim?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.669
Hmm?

31:53.760 --> 31:54.795
What are...

31:55.440 --> 31:57.351
What are you doing?
I'm going swimming.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.794
Hardin.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
Hardin.

32:13.760 --> 32:14.875
Come in.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.279
You can wear my t-shirt.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.399
It feels amazing.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.074
A little privacy?

32:40.920 --> 32:41.955
Please?

32:52.480 --> 32:53.480
Okay.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.875
What?

33:03.800 --> 33:05.279
I like it better on you.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.274
Can I ask you something?

33:49.080 --> 33:50.434
Do I even have a choice?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.150
Who do you love the most
in the world?

33:58.240 --> 33:59.275
Easy.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.433
Myself.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.834
Of course you do.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.559
What's your boyfriend's name?

34:11.480 --> 34:12.708
It's Noah.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.070
Noah. Does he go here?

34:17.600 --> 34:18.920
He's in high school.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.679
High school?

34:21.800 --> 34:24.313
And what does a high school
kid do to deserve you?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.710
He is nice to me.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.549
Nice.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.156
Isn't that just another
word for boring?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.149
Ugh.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.554
Not always.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.838
Can I
show you something?

34:45.239 --> 34:46.833
Hold your breath.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.269
The silence.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.560
It's peaceful.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.638
You think that's weird.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.435
No.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.154
Not at all.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.670
I thought that you just
wanted to be friends.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.035
I don't think we can
ever be just friends.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.515
Have you never
been touched before?

38:29.480 --> 38:30.914
Why did you stop?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.073
We've got time.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.318
So, why do you
call them chips?

38:45.080 --> 38:46.999
Why do you call them fries?
'Cause they're fried.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.559
They're not French.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.316
You've got plenty there!

38:53.840 --> 38:55.592
Um, I ordered mine
without ketchup.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.910
Oh, right. I'll be right back.
Thank you.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.231
No ketchup.
That's very un-American.

39:02.520 --> 39:04.113
I'm full of surprises.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.797
So, what's your story then?

39:10.880 --> 39:11.950
My story?

39:12.800 --> 39:15.758
Yeah. Like your...
Your family.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.633
How you ended up here.
I'll pass.

39:23.640 --> 39:27.634
I just don't think asking a
bunch of arbitrary questions

39:27.760 --> 39:30.434
about someone's past is really
gonna tell you who they are.

39:32.040 --> 39:36.318
I can find out who you are by sitting
here and spending time with you.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.560
What?

39:47.160 --> 39:48.195
What?

39:49.600 --> 39:50.749
What are you doing?

39:50.840 --> 39:54.117
I'm just waiting for you
to reveal your true self to me

39:54.240 --> 39:57.437
by just sitting here and
spending time with you.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.633
Here you go.
Thank you.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.033
Okay, fair enough.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.269
One question.

40:08.080 --> 40:11.152
Why do you have all those romance
novels if you don't believe in love?

40:11.280 --> 40:12.953
Who says I
don't believe in love?

40:14.360 --> 40:16.590
You did, in Soto's class.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.829
True.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.230
Maybe don't believe
everything I say, then.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.155
Oh. Hey, guys-

40:30.760 --> 40:31.989
Hey, Tessa.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
Guys.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.193
Let's just hang out
for a minute.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.556
So, what have
you two been up to?

40:42.160 --> 40:44.231
We were just, um...
We're just getting some food.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.354
How's the boyfriend, Tess?

40:47.720 --> 40:48.869
We're leaving.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.313
Perfect. I need a ride.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.719
It's not a good time.
You can ask Zed for a ride.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.000
Dude, we literally
just got here.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.951
Excuse me.
You're excused.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.555
All right.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.229
Tessa?

41:06.720 --> 41:07.755
Really?

41:10.320 --> 41:12.357
Yes. I won't be long.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.999
I'll be at the bar.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.680
See you around.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.829
What's up, bro?
So, fill us in.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.149
What was that?
What was what?

41:40.240 --> 41:43.039
Were you, like, embarrassed
that they saw us together?

41:43.680 --> 41:44.715
No.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.920
You know, I am going to tell
Noah about us, I just...

41:51.960 --> 41:52.995
Us?

41:53.960 --> 41:55.030
What do you mean, "Us"?

41:58.040 --> 42:00.350
If you want to dump Mr. High
School then go ahead,

42:00.440 --> 42:01.953
but don't do it
on my account.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.400
What?

42:08.320 --> 42:11.119
Look, it was fun,
but I don't date.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.157
Are you actually kidding me?

44:01.080 --> 44:02.309
You're here.

44:22.480 --> 44:23.600
What are you dreaming about?

44:38.480 --> 44:39.675
Surprise!

44:40.360 --> 44:41.430
What...

44:42.800 --> 44:43.915
What are you...

44:44.840 --> 44:46.274
What are you doing here?

44:48.320 --> 44:49.469
How are you?

44:52.680 --> 44:53.715
Thank you.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.310
You Okay?

44:58.240 --> 44:59.275
Yeah!

44:59.360 --> 45:00.680
No, yeah, yeah, of course.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.518
Okay. Yeah.
Thank you.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.913
So, what are we gonna do?

45:20.080 --> 45:21.080
Hey, it's Tessa.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.878
What's up, Tessa?
Hey.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.114
MAN 13 Hi.
MAN 23 Hi.

45:27.280 --> 45:28.998
We... I think
we met at the dorm.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.191
So, he does exist.
Nice to meet you.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.158
What's up, man? Zed.
How's it going? Good.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.635
Tessa.

45:40.440 --> 45:41.510
Here you go.
Thanks.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.671
The cops will probably
be here soon, so...

45:46.280 --> 45:48.191
Should we...
Should we get out of here?

45:56.680 --> 45:59.035
Hey, Tessa.
Didn't expect to see you here.

46:04.680 --> 46:08.389
So, how about we play
a game of suck and blow?

46:08.680 --> 46:10.671
Suck and blow. I'm down.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.435
Okay, I got it.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.191
Yes.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.840
Guess you know
what that means.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.310
No, no, I'm...
Dude, dude, dude.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.993
Dude, don't go there,
all right?

46:24.160 --> 46:25.680
Chill out, man,
it's just a game.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.074
Hey, man,
she doesn't have to.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.919
Relax.
Okay, relax.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.315
No, no.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.400
No, I'm...

46:32.960 --> 46:34.155
Hey!

46:36.320 --> 46:37.320
Hey!

46:37.960 --> 46:39.280
Hey, hey! Get off!

46:41.400 --> 46:42.629
You're gonna regret this.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.514
Dude. Come on.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.400
What are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

46:49.760 --> 46:51.034
- Hardin. Hardin.
- Hardin.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.913
Hey. Thanks for coming.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.639
What happened?

48:02.520 --> 48:03.635
Uh...

48:03.720 --> 48:05.631
Well, it started
about his father,

48:05.800 --> 48:09.589
and then your name
sort of came up.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.713
He won't talk to me, so...

48:16.120 --> 48:18.509
I figured maybe
he would talk to you.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.509
Where is he?

48:40.920 --> 48:42.035
What are you doing here?

48:43.440 --> 48:44.794
I was worried about you.

48:49.120 --> 48:51.680
Shouldn't you be with your
perfect little boyfriend, Theresa?

48:51.840 --> 48:53.399
Don't bring Noah into this.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.474
I thought you didn't drink.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.909
I don't.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.275
I didn't.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.160
What does it matter?

49:04.320 --> 49:05.719
You made a real mess in there.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.238
I was celebrating.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.635
Didn't you hear?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.758
Dear old Dad
is getting married.

49:17.320 --> 49:20.233
You should see the dump my poor
mom lives in back in London.

49:26.640 --> 49:28.438
Don't you feel like
you've had enough?

49:44.880 --> 49:45.950
Don't.

49:46.960 --> 49:47.995
I can get it.

49:48.080 --> 49:49.673
Ah. Damn it.

49:56.720 --> 49:57.755
Come with me.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.077
I'm sorry
for how I treated you.

50:26.840 --> 50:27.840
Um...

50:29.000 --> 50:31.992
If... If you don't date,

50:32.160 --> 50:34.310
if that's how you feel...

50:36.840 --> 50:39.275
I don't think
that is how I feel anymore.

50:45.280 --> 50:46.509
I'm a mess.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.837
I think that
we're both a mess.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.712
You don't ever
have to cover up,

51:56.520 --> 51:57.749
not for me.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.395
Hey.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.752
Yeah.
You okay?

53:42.920 --> 53:45.434
Where were you? I texted you,
you didn't answer me.

53:45.600 --> 53:46.874
I'm sorry, my...

53:47.040 --> 53:48.872
My phone died, I'm sorry.
Where were you?

53:49.560 --> 53:51.631
A friend needed my help.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.319
In the middle of the night?

54:10.160 --> 54:12.071
Noah, I can explain.
Can we...

54:15.000 --> 54:17.230
Please, can we just...
Can we just go inside and talk?

54:18.880 --> 54:19.880
I...

54:19.960 --> 54:21.519
Noah.

54:21.680 --> 54:23.159
I don't believe this.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.280
No, Noah.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.555
Noah, wait.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.515
Noah, I'm...

54:29.800 --> 54:31.199
I'm confused.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.431
I've wanted to talk to you
about it for a while.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.399
I am so, so sorry.

54:45.600 --> 54:46.635
Noah.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.835
Tessa.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.839
Go home, Hardin.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.280
Noah and I just

55:28.440 --> 55:29.794
broke up.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.874
I feel like I just
lost my best friend.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.991
Come over here. Come on.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.394
I didn't expect to see you.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.435
When my dad left...

57:26.240 --> 57:27.594
I was 10.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.149
He left us with nothing.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.191
And my mom, she just...

57:42.720 --> 57:44.472
Sort of fell apart.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.117
I had to take care
of her alone.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
But...

57:51.640 --> 57:54.075
Noah was there for me,
you know?

57:57.600 --> 57:59.830
I hate myself
for what I did to him.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.878
Tessa, it's not your fault.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.720
Yeah, it is.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.991
Noah is my best friend.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.679
But you“.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.193
You're so much more.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.958
Library's closing.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.594
Library's getting
ready to close.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.237
Library is closing.

58:49.160 --> 58:50.639
Follow me.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.275
Come on.
What are...

58:53.000 --> 58:54.035
Down here.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
Shh.

59:10.600 --> 59:13.638
"You could draw me to fire,
you could draw me to water,

59:14.240 --> 59:16.470
"you could draw me
to the gallows,

59:16.640 --> 59:18.438
"you could draw me
to any death,

59:18.960 --> 59:21.429
"you could draw me to anything
I have most avoided.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.589
"This and the confusion
of my thoughts,

59:24.760 --> 59:26.990
"so that I am fit for nothing,

59:27.160 --> 59:30.312
"is what I mean
by your being the ruin of me."

59:33.440 --> 59:34.669
Why'd you stop?

59:36.640 --> 59:37.675
We should go.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.310
Hey! What are you doing here?

59:47.000 --> 59:48.354
Stop!

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.799
And perhaps the most
mesmerizing of all systems

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.276
is the binary
star phenomenon.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.877
Two stars find their way across
vast stretches of space and time

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.713
to find another wandering body

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.434
and become attached
for eternity...

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.478
...in each other's orbit,

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.678
each star pushing the other

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.071
to explode in supernova...

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.877
Becoming either the nucleus
of a planetary nebula

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.551
or, just as often, resulting
in the death spiral...

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.199
What are you doing,
Tessa?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.553
Learning about the stars?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.873
The stars assist
in each other's destruction.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.751
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are right now?

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.596
What are you always
writing in there?

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.234
None of your business.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.515
Show me.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.193
No.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.758
Come on.
Not a chance.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.433
I just want to see what's...

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680
Ugh.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.237
Tessa, hon?
I've called all day...

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.994
Tessa?
Mom?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.675
What are you doing here?

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.959
What the hell is going on?

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.719
Nothing.
Who's he?

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.837
Is he the guy
Noah told me about?

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.714
So, this is how you spend your
time, instead of going to class?

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.109
No!
I think I should go.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.754
You think?

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.036
Can we talk about this outside?
Please? Please?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.154
You, go.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.435
Come with me.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.751
You have got to be kidding me.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.879
I knew as soon as I saw that roommate
that something like this would happen.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.757
Are you
serious right now?

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.877
I mean, and after
all this work

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.509
and you are going
to throw it away for some boy.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.030
What are you talking about?
I'm not.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.430
You're going to break up
with this boy,

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.479
and you are going to focus
on your schoolwork.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.474
Do you even know what it has been
like, trying to be perfect for you?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.039
Having you mold my life into the
way that you wanted it to be?

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.758
I did it for your own good.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.556
I am so, so sorry, Mom,

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.031
that your life didn't work out
the way that you wanted it to,

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.474
I really am.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.954
But this is my life and you
have to let me live it.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.711
Is that really what you want?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.520
Yes.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.073
If I leave now,

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.680
you're cut off.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.197
He's gonna break your heart.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.270
She's cutting you off
because of Hardin?

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.114
I'm just a little
worried, is all.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.435
Why?

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.919
Hardin is...

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.034
Hardin is complicated.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.198
Yeah, I know, but...

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.553
He's different around me.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.358
Just be careful.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.680
You okay?

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.797
Yeah. Where have you been?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.478
Jump in and I'll show you.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.914
You ready?
Yes.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.679
Yes!
Are you sure?

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.672
Whose place is this?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.354
Friend of my father's.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
A professor.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.874
Where are they?

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.719
She's in Italy.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.594
All year.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.792
I'm meant to be
watering the plants.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.078
Ooh, she paints.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.718
It's really nice.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.552
Imagine if it were our place.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.955
Sure.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.674
It can be.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.877
What, you mean like,
live together?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.238
When you told me your mom was going
to cut you off, I had to do something.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.480
We can stay here
for the rest of the year.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.954
Just you and me.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.674
You did this for me?

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.080
Mmm-hmm.
Here.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.760
"You're going to bring
out the best in others."

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.278
Check out that one.
It looks a bit like you.

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:26.477
This is crazy.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.473
I still
can't believe it.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:48.158
Hmm? Believe what?

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.234
That you're mine.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.199
Not this again.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.959
I don't deserve you.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:10.229
Nothing could ever change
the way that I feel about you.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.195
I cannot believe
you've talked me into this.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.794
It's a wedding reception.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.200
It's not a jail sentence.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.915
Hey.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.078
Hey. You guys made it.
Yeah.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.277
You look beautiful, Tessa.
Oh, thank you.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.793
Hey, you clean up well, man.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.712
This is so fancy.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.112
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.280
So we're brothers.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.475
Yeah.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.960
You must be really happy
for your mom and Ken.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.032
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.674
I'll see you two in there.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.838
This looks so good.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.639
Look who's here.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.279
It's good to see you.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.076
You too.
And you must be...

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.474
Tessa.
Tessa.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.915
I'm Karen. I'm Landon's mom.
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.394
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.595
Thank you.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.952
It means a lot to me
that you could be here.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.434
Congratulations.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.558
Thanks for coming.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.037
I'm happy you
decided to join us, son.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.155
Landon tells us you're in
Professor Soto's seminar.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.510
Yeah.
So, you're an English major?

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.589
Um, I would love to,
but I think if I want to be employed,

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.870
maybe business or econ.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.720
If you're interested in the
business side of literature,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.438
my friend owns
a publishing company.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.513
- You mean Vance?
- Yes.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.113
Well, I can call Vance for her.
Of course.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.157
I'm sure he'd be
happy to hear from you.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.676
Ken, the Dean has arrived.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.958
Come on, I think
we should go say hi.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.554
Enjoy.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.278
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, you too.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.913
Let's just have fun.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.075
I can't.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.749
Why not?

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.749
You made me promise
to be on my best behavior.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.679
Thank you all for coming.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.835
Tonight we celebrate
a great good fortune.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.629
And her name is Karen.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.478
The love of my life, and...

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.438
And frankly,
she saved my life.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.153
I'm suddenly blessed
by a new bride, a new life,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.754
and not one,
but two brilliant sons.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.912
Hardin and Landon.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.680
I remember an earlier time,
when my greatest pleasure

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.080
was to listen to Hardin,

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.270
who loved to recite passages
from novels, all by memory.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.518
And he would perform them,
leaving me with tears...

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.273
That's not the man
I grew up with.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.959
Or laughter...

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.751
- My father was a drunk.
- ...and sometimes both.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.314
And nothing more.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:26.112
- At least he's trying.
- I don't think he had any idea

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.032
just how important
those moments were to me.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.437
Which is more than
my father ever did.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.551
People change.
Clearly.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.512
It still doesn't change
what happened.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.759
What happened?

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.033
And I look forward
to earning that role.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.993
One night,
when I was eight...

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.757
My dad was at the pub.
Drunk, as usual.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.353
He messed with the wrong guys.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.558
They came to our house
for payback.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.069
He wasn't there.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.994
They found my mom instead.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.035
I tried...

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.469
I tried to fight them off,
but I couldn't.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.113
Thank you, my friends,

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.995
family...

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.274
And that's my dad.
...and university faculty.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.511
The beloved
Chancellor Scott.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.991
So let's have fun.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.514
I don't suppose you recall
any of those passages.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.633
Not the way you remember it.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.431
I would love to have a dance
with your brilliant son.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.794
I want you now.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:29.830
Are you sure?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.355
Yeah.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.159
Do you want me to stop?

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.676
No. Just go slow.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.113
“Car-ll
It was "cat."

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.199
Do another one.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720
Uh...

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.680
Mmm, that one is...

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.078
I have no idea.
I'm really good at this. Yeah.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.000
Okay, just do one more.
I promise I'll get it.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920
Um...

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.080
Mmm.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.235
Mmm.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.475
I don't know.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.109
What was it?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.077
I'm gonna stay up late
and work on that.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.995
And then I'll... I'll text you.
I'll just see you. Yeah.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.117
Hey.
Hey.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.353
How's it going? I haven't seen
you since, like, the bonfire.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.073
Yeah. I've been busy.
I guess.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.550
How's it going with you
and your boyfriend?

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.274
Uh, we're not
together anymore.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.880
Ouch.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.714
Bye-bye, High School.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.393
Yeah, it was
pretty painful.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.511
I can tell you
moved on pretty quickly.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.790
How's Hardin?
What do you mean?

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.391
He told me you guys
have been hanging out.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.956
Yeah. We have.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.195
Cool.

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.795
Really?

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.591
Yeah. I mean,
Hardin does what Hardin does.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.675
What's wrong?

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.478
What's all this about?

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.519
What didn't you tell me?

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.280
Nothing. I don't know
what she's talking about.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.160
You don't know what she's talking about?
I mean, I don't know.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.038
What didn't you tell me?
Nothing!

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.919
I need to go. What? Now?
Hardin, answer me.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.953
Where are you going?
Out.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.839
What's going on?

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.077
Do you trust me?
Of course I do.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.793
Then what's the problem?

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.158
What are you
doing in Hardin's car?

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.192
What, I can't borrow his car?

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.117
Jace, just tell me
where he is.

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.313
Maybe he's at Blind Bob's.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.114
Oh, my gosh! Hey!

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.709
What's the matter?

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.480
Are you okay?
Yeah.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.233
You want some fries?
Are you hungry?

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.231
I haven't seen you
since you moved out.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.229
Um...

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.037
I've been living with
Hardin off campus.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.919
Wait.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.634
You two are living together?
Yeah.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.919
Wow, Tessa. I didn't know
you two were that serious.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.599
Yeah, we are.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.079
How long has this
been going on for and...

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.469
Look who I found.
Hey, Jace. Hey, Hardin.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.676
What's up?
What's up, Tessa?

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.520
I got you.

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.795
Tessa.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.795
Hi, Hardin.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.040
Tessa was just
telling us the latest.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.433
Tessa's been filling us in
on all the details.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.276
Moving in together.
And you guys are so adorable.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.798
Is there anything
you want to tell Tessa?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.549
Yeah, like what's been
going on between you and her?

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.039
Nothing's going on
with me and her...

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040
I don't believe you.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.274
What have you said?

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.913
Tessa, I swear... What...
I saw the texts that she sent you.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.355
They didn't mean anything.
I didn't even reply to them.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.959
They meant nothing.
You've got to be kidding me.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.473
Tessa,
nothing's going on.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.790
Don't you think this thing
has gone a little too far?

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.200
What thing, Hardin?

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.354
Something's going on,

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.400
but it's not what you think.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.553
Molly, shut up.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.669
Tessa“.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.999
Let's get out of here,
and I'll explain.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.434
I'll explain everything,
I promise.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.079
Remember truth or dare?

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:51.680
What?

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.909
Molly, don't.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.590
Molly!

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.040
<i>I'm done playing this game.</i>

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880
<i>I like this girl.</i>

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.911
<i>Looks like Hardin Scott
just got his first rejection.</i>

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.720
<i>You lot don't think
I can make it happen?</i>

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.914
<i>Make what happen,
Hardin?</i>

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.869
Here's a dare.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.993
<i>Make her fall in love with me.</i>

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.229
And then...

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.629
<i>I'll just...</i>

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.634
<i>Turn it off.</i>

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.798
It was all a game.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.675
Tessa?

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.789
Tessa.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.797
Tessa, please.
You have to believe me.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.872
Tessa, that was
before everything.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.398
Before I got to know you.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.469
Is that true?

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.394
And all of you knew?

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.795
Tessa.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.589
Tessa, wait.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.840
Tessa, wait. Tessa!

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.960
So, what exactly
did you tell them, then?

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.510
Nothing.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.234
None of it was real.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.434
I actually thought...

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.869
I thought that...

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.918
You're just a liar.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.880
That was all before.
Before what?

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400
Before...

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.360
You snapped your fingers,
and you turned it off?

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.440
You said nothing could change
the way you felt about me.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.557
Then I guess we're both liars.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.470
Hi, Mom.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.074
What happened?

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.590
I don't really
want to talk about it.

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.269
I just...

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.549
I came here to say

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.959
that I'm sorry.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.555
I'm...

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.433
I'm sorry too.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:24.394
<i>Hove you.</i>

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.038
So, how come you're back?

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.832
I just needed to come home.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.038
I'm so sorry, Noah.

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.999
I never meant to hurt you.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.549
Yeah, I know.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.431
I guess I just never saw

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.959
any of this coming.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.714
Yeah, but...

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.877
That's, like,
the point, right?

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.794
We, like... We change
and we discover who we are.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.634
I think that's okay.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.155
Yeah?

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.109
Yeah.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.674
On a parting note,

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.871
I was deeply impressed
by all of your papers

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:24.395
attacking our themes for this
semester.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.078
Congratulations on all of your
good work.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.830
Good job.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.075
Ms. Young.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.719
This is what Hardin turned in.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.319
I think it was actually written
more for you than it was for me.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.920
Thank you.

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:33.590
What is that?

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.355
Um...

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.869
A secret spot.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.950
And a good place to think.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.909
<i>"I've read hundreds
of novels in my life,</i>

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.550
<i>"most of them claiming that love
was the center of the universe,</i>

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.194
<i>"that it could heal
any damage inside of us,</i>

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.557
<i>"that it was what
we need to survive.</i>

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.800
<i>"From Darcy to Heathcliff,
I thought they were fools,</i>

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.478
<i>"that love was
something fictional,</i>

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.275
<i>"only found in worn
pages of a book.</i>

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.634
<i>"But that has all changed</i>

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.950
<i>"since I met
my Elizabeth Bennet.</i>

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.597
<i>"I never thought
I would find myself</i>

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.230
<i>"completely and utterly
consumed by another, until her.</i>

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.238
<i>"She took my hand</i>

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.038
<i>"and led me
out of the darkness</i>

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.919
<i>"and showed me that whatever
our souls are made</i> of...

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.314
<i>"Hers and mine are the same.</i>

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.589
<i>"I'm sorry.</i>

01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:58.549
<i>"Please forgive me.</i>

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.074
<i>"You once asked who I
loved most in this world.</i>

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.595
<i>"It's you."</i>
