WEBVTT

00:03.513 --> 00:04.899
Oh, damn!

00:04.994 --> 00:06.764
What password
did I use for this?

00:06.765 --> 00:08.243
Um...

00:08.244 --> 00:09.960
Uh, Jake.

00:10.462 --> 00:13.280
Nope. Um...

00:13.282 --> 00:15.132
Jake-1.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.202
Jake-2.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.891
Alan.

00:25.844 --> 00:27.477
Alan-1.

00:27.479 --> 00:28.729
Berta!

00:28.731 --> 00:30.764
Ooh, maybe that's it!

00:31.850 --> 00:33.634
Big Scary Lady.

00:34.552 --> 00:36.320
Where is Berta?

00:36.322 --> 00:38.238
She went home early.
Said she wasn't feeling well.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.523
Anything I can do for you?

00:39.525 --> 00:41.241
Out of dental floss.

00:41.243 --> 00:42.943
Ooh. Uh, waxed?

00:42.945 --> 00:45.061
Unwaxed? Cinnamon?

00:45.063 --> 00:47.731
You carry a selection
of dental floss?

00:47.733 --> 00:50.217
I am a soldier in the war
against gingivitis.

00:51.085 --> 00:53.120
Got the gums of a 20-year-old.

00:53.122 --> 00:54.371
I'll take the cinnamon.

00:54.373 --> 00:55.205
Ooh, good choice.

00:55.207 --> 00:56.573
Clean teeth and fresh breath.

00:56.575 --> 00:57.507
Mm-hmm.

00:57.509 --> 00:58.542
What are you doing?

00:58.544 --> 01:00.127
I was trying to do
some on-line banking,

01:00.129 --> 01:01.261
but I forgot my password.

01:01.263 --> 01:03.013
I can help you with that.
Move over.

01:03.015 --> 01:05.682
Oh, I forgot I had a computer
genius in the house.

01:05.684 --> 01:07.601
Mm-hmm.

01:07.603 --> 01:11.889
Okay, let's put in
your e-mail address.

01:11.891 --> 01:15.642
And click on
"forgot password."

01:17.929 --> 01:19.229
Hey, there's a password hint.

01:19.231 --> 01:21.398
"What is my favorite state?"

01:21.400 --> 01:24.651
Uh, California?

01:24.653 --> 01:27.070
You are a hacker's nightmare.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.073
Not California.

01:30.075 --> 01:30.958
Huh.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.443
Gosh, um, try Hawaii.

01:34.963 --> 01:36.129
Nope.

01:36.131 --> 01:39.115
The good news is we only
have 48 states to go.

01:39.117 --> 01:40.834
Favorite state,
favorite state.

01:40.836 --> 01:42.803
What's my favorite state?

01:44.256 --> 01:46.056
I'm getting
a Skype call.

01:46.058 --> 01:48.475
It's my ex-wife.

01:48.477 --> 01:49.793
Hi, Walden.

01:49.795 --> 01:51.178
Hi, Bridget.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.145
Engorged!

01:52.147 --> 01:54.114
My favorite state is
fully engorged!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.151
Hello, Alan.

01:58.153 --> 01:59.135
Hi, Bridget.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.605
Um, that was
just my-my password.

02:01.607 --> 02:04.408
You know what?
I'll just let you guys talk.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.660
How do you explain him
to people?

02:06.662 --> 02:10.297
I usually tell people that my
wife drove me to homosexuality.

02:11.833 --> 02:12.833
What's up?

02:12.835 --> 02:14.234
Billy called.

02:14.236 --> 02:16.336
Billy Stanhope?

02:16.338 --> 02:18.505
Yeah, he said he's has a
business proposition for you.

02:18.507 --> 02:20.507
Really?

02:20.509 --> 02:22.793
Why on Earth would I do
business with him

02:22.795 --> 02:24.261
after what he did to me?

02:24.263 --> 02:26.930
Hey, don't get upset with me.
I'm just the messenger.

02:26.932 --> 02:29.933
I'm not upset. I've moved on.

02:29.935 --> 02:31.351
It, uh, it's behind me.

02:31.353 --> 02:34.554
Yeah, I recognize your
"I'm not upset" eye twitch.

02:34.556 --> 02:36.723
My eye is not twitching.

02:36.725 --> 02:40.344
You know, tell him thank you,
but no, thank you.

02:40.346 --> 02:41.144
Got it.

02:41.146 --> 02:43.346
I wish him well, but I pass.

02:43.348 --> 02:44.231
Fine.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.483
I'm flattered, but no can do.

02:46.485 --> 02:47.484
Understood.

02:47.486 --> 02:49.152
And if my eye is twitching,

02:49.154 --> 02:50.904
it's only because I have
conjunctivitis.

02:50.906 --> 02:54.191
You don't have conjunctivitis,
Walden.

02:54.193 --> 02:55.292
We're not married anymore,
Bridget.

02:55.294 --> 02:57.711
You have no idea
what kind of diseases I have.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.031
Good-bye.

03:03.368 --> 03:06.336
How about that.

03:06.338 --> 03:07.337
Billy Stanhope.

03:15.531 --> 03:17.731
Whoa!

03:22.020 --> 03:23.353
Everything okay?

03:23.355 --> 03:25.605
Yeah. Why?

03:27.025 --> 03:30.410
Uh... the blood-curdling scream?

03:30.412 --> 03:32.395
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

03:32.397 --> 03:36.450
No, no, I often react that way
after chatting with my ex-wife.

03:36.452 --> 03:39.252
This isn't about my ex-wife.

03:39.254 --> 03:41.755
It's about my ex-friend
Billy Stanhope.

03:41.757 --> 03:44.074
Oh, I've never
heard you mention him before.

03:44.076 --> 03:46.426
Have you ever heard me mention
rectal cancer?

03:46.428 --> 03:47.911
No.

03:47.913 --> 03:50.013
Same principle.

03:50.015 --> 03:51.915
What went down between you two?

03:52.918 --> 03:54.084
Well, we built

03:54.086 --> 03:55.919
a software company in
Bridget's garage,

03:55.921 --> 03:57.888
and then sold it for
a couple billion dollars.

03:57.890 --> 04:00.307
That son of a bitch.

04:01.359 --> 04:02.976
No wonder you hate him.

04:02.978 --> 04:04.444
I don't think you understand.

04:04.446 --> 04:07.647
He didn't want to sell,
so when we did, he went crazy.

04:07.649 --> 04:08.648
Really?

04:08.650 --> 04:09.649
Yeah, oh, yeah.

04:09.651 --> 04:10.617
Here, look, he put it on YouTube

04:10.619 --> 04:11.818
for the whole world to see.

04:13.204 --> 04:14.905
Hello, world.

04:14.907 --> 04:16.123
It's me, Billy Stanhope,

04:16.125 --> 04:22.429
and I'm here to drop another
smart bomb of truth!

04:23.915 --> 04:26.383
This is my ex-partner
Walden Schmidt.

04:26.385 --> 04:28.251
Oh, isn't he pretty?

04:28.253 --> 04:33.173
Hey, Walden, tell everyone
how pretty you are.

04:33.175 --> 04:34.841
I'm pretty!

04:36.461 --> 04:39.896
Yes, you are.
You <i>are</i> pretty.

04:39.898 --> 04:41.231
But that's just on
the outside.

04:41.233 --> 04:45.185
On the inside,
you are a soul-sucking,

04:45.187 --> 04:47.737
money-grubbing sellout!

04:47.739 --> 04:50.073
Oh, don't forget giant douche.

04:50.075 --> 04:52.359
I'm also a giant douche!

04:52.994 --> 04:54.327
Thanks, buddy.

04:54.329 --> 04:57.080
I'm always forgetting about your
extreme doucheyness!

04:57.082 --> 04:59.199
You know what
I'm gonna do, Walden?

04:59.201 --> 05:02.702
I... I'm gonna eat you, yeah.

05:02.704 --> 05:05.321
I'm gonna eat you
and chew you up,

05:05.323 --> 05:08.792
and digest you and then
go in the bathroom

05:08.794 --> 05:12.796
and take a big steaming Schmidt!

05:12.798 --> 05:14.381
Whoa.

05:14.383 --> 05:16.099
You think that's bad.

05:16.101 --> 05:17.551
Watch this one.

05:17.553 --> 05:21.972
Hey, folks!
Walden Schmidt here.

05:21.974 --> 05:26.643
I just wanted you to see me
as I really am.

05:26.645 --> 05:29.396
So he's actually talking out
of his ass?

05:29.398 --> 05:31.982
He calls it "buttriloquism"

05:32.867 --> 05:34.017
That's-That's very disturbing.

05:34.019 --> 05:35.018
Yeah.

05:35.020 --> 05:36.119
That's the least disturbing

05:36.121 --> 05:38.688
of the ass-talking videos.

05:38.690 --> 05:40.790
It-It's crazy.

05:40.792 --> 05:43.043
I made this guy, like,
a billion dollars,

05:43.045 --> 05:44.294
and then he turns on me.

05:44.296 --> 05:47.363
And then he accuses <i>me</i>
of being a sellout.

05:47.365 --> 05:48.865
Talk about ingratitude.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.333
If you made me rich,

05:50.335 --> 05:52.535
the only thing
I'd accuse you of

05:52.537 --> 05:56.389
is being the best... guy ever.

05:56.391 --> 05:57.390
Thanks.

05:57.392 --> 05:58.642
Seriously.
If you don't believe it,

05:58.644 --> 06:01.211
throw me a couple of mil
and get ready for a tongue bath.

06:01.213 --> 06:02.579
I doubt that will be necessary.

06:02.581 --> 06:04.380
I am not talking just
metaphorically.

06:04.382 --> 06:06.399
I will lick you
from head to toe.

Hi.

07:00.006 --> 07:01.455
Hi.

07:01.457 --> 07:03.091
I'm Billy Stanhope.

07:03.093 --> 07:05.343
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I recognize you from the video.

07:06.628 --> 07:07.812
You look good.

07:07.814 --> 07:11.599
Well, you know, I cut out sugar
and took up yoga,

07:11.601 --> 07:13.968
stopped smoking crack.

07:15.154 --> 07:18.139
Well, whatever it is you're
doing, it's working.

07:18.141 --> 07:20.091
Who are you?

07:20.093 --> 07:21.526
Oh, yeah, I'm Walden's friend...

07:21.528 --> 07:24.946
confidante, mentor, gatekeeper.

07:24.948 --> 07:27.665
Oh, yeah, Bridget told
me about you.

07:27.667 --> 07:28.750
Yeah, the leech.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.652
Alan Harper.
Pleased to meet you.

07:31.654 --> 07:34.339
Hey. Listen, gatekeeper,
any way I could talk

07:34.341 --> 07:36.207
to Walden for just
five minutes?

07:36.209 --> 07:38.376
Oh, I don't think so.
He's pretty peeved.

07:38.378 --> 07:39.761
I got this billion-dollar idea

07:39.763 --> 07:41.379
that can't move forward
without him.

07:41.381 --> 07:44.015
But, look, if he won't see me,
he won't see me, so...

07:44.017 --> 07:45.633
Hold up, Billy.

07:46.385 --> 07:47.618
Come on in. Come on in.

07:47.620 --> 07:48.636
Uh, talk to me.

07:48.638 --> 07:51.155
So, uh, a billion
dollars, you say?

07:51.157 --> 07:53.674
At least.
Wow.

07:53.676 --> 07:56.310
What could possibly be worth
a billion dollars?

07:56.312 --> 07:57.228
It's simple, really.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.479
I mean, are you familiar with

07:58.481 --> 08:00.848
Web-based aggregate upstream
power grid manipulation?

08:03.452 --> 08:06.387
Uh... I-I have Netflix.

08:06.389 --> 08:07.572
Okay, look, it's not important.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.689
If you could just...

08:08.691 --> 08:10.908
I just need to talk
to him for five minutes.

08:10.910 --> 08:12.210
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

08:12.212 --> 08:13.027
All right. Here's $50.00.

08:13.029 --> 08:14.178
Wait right here.
Okay.

08:19.668 --> 08:21.302
Yeah?

08:21.304 --> 08:22.420
Got a second?

08:22.422 --> 08:23.755
Yeah, come in.

08:24.673 --> 08:26.140
Whatcha doin'?

08:26.142 --> 08:27.258
Playing a racing game.

08:27.260 --> 08:29.177
Ah, that's fun.

08:29.179 --> 08:32.597
Uh, after my divorce, I played
"World of Warcraft" for a while,

08:32.599 --> 08:34.381
hoping to meet girls.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.383
Did you meet any?

08:36.385 --> 08:37.934
Well, let's just say, if you're

08:37.937 --> 08:41.272
lonely enough and drunk enough,
everybody's a girl.

08:42.524 --> 08:45.693
So, listen, um, I was having

08:45.695 --> 08:49.730
a very interesting conversation
with your former compadre.

08:51.566 --> 08:53.868
You let that son of a bitch
in my house?

08:53.870 --> 08:55.569
Uh, well, yeah,
I-I was just...

08:55.571 --> 08:57.905
You let him
in my house?!

08:57.907 --> 08:58.840
Well, I didn't
see any harm.

08:58.842 --> 08:59.874
I kinda felt sorry
for the guy.

08:59.876 --> 09:01.459
I thought I could
trust you, Alan!

09:01.461 --> 09:03.461
You can! I just got
sucked in by the words

09:03.463 --> 09:05.029
"billion dollar idea."

09:11.053 --> 09:12.520
What idea?

09:12.522 --> 09:14.055
Uh, something about, uh,

09:14.057 --> 09:19.227
upstream grid perambulation?

09:19.229 --> 09:20.561
What?

09:20.563 --> 09:25.099
Uh, in-in-incubation...
ma... ma-masturbation...

09:25.101 --> 09:26.117
I don't know!

09:26.119 --> 09:28.352
Was it Web-based aggregated

09:28.354 --> 09:29.704
upstream power grid
manipulation?

09:29.706 --> 09:30.621
Yes, that's it.

09:30.623 --> 09:33.307
Oh, my God...

09:33.309 --> 09:35.259
He figured out
The Electric Suitcase.

09:35.261 --> 09:36.777
Is it really worth
a billion dollars?

09:36.779 --> 09:38.329
Oh, yeah.

09:40.132 --> 09:43.768
Probably should've
held out for more than 50.

09:44.636 --> 09:46.453
All right,
let's hear it.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.673
Oh, you look good
without the beard.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.291
And you look good
without the crack pipe.

09:50.293 --> 09:52.176
Okay, just...

09:53.545 --> 09:54.595
You really think

09:54.597 --> 09:55.847
we can finally build
The Electric Suitcase?

09:55.849 --> 09:57.682
Yes.
We have the technology now.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.184

12:32.565 --> 12:33.780
How'd you come up with that?

12:33.782 --> 12:35.065
It was the sound
that Billy was making

12:54.537 --> 12:56.336
All right, where would we start?

12:56.338 --> 12:57.838
Well, first thing, we'd go over

12:57.840 --> 12:59.539
the original design
for the code,

12:59.541 --> 13:01.925
split it up into little chunks
that can be handled

13:01.927 --> 13:03.560
by multiple parallel processors.

13:03.562 --> 13:04.645
Sounds good.

13:04.647 --> 13:05.929
Yeah, that's what
I would do, yeah.

13:05.931 --> 13:07.814
Mm-hmm.

13:07.816 --> 13:09.233
Then we can start
compiling the modules,

13:09.235 --> 13:11.635
testing them, see if we can
get them to talk to each other.

13:11.637 --> 13:12.603
Yeah, exactly.

13:12.605 --> 13:14.188
No brainer.

13:14.190 --> 13:16.940
Maybe the way to start is
I'll set up the testing sandbox,

13:16.942 --> 13:18.492
and you set up the I/O module,

13:18.494 --> 13:20.060
and then we'll just
go from there.

13:20.062 --> 13:21.028
Good.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.112
What do I do?

13:22.114 --> 13:23.447

13:23.449 --> 13:25.282
Uh...

13:25.284 --> 13:26.399
I-I can make cookies.

13:26.401 --> 13:27.751
You like cookies?

13:29.387 --> 13:31.872

have a prayer

but it turns out,

13:47.640 --> 13:49.923
this Billy guy
is really his best friend.

13:49.925 --> 13:52.109

19:49.950 --> 19:53.018
Uh, we had
a little accident, too.

19:54.321 --> 19:56.622
H-H-How are you guys doing?

19:56.624 --> 19:58.290
Oh, hey, we're good, man.

19:58.292 --> 20:00.793
We're about to, uh,
about to test the first module.

20:00.795 --> 20:02.244
Walden, would you do the honors?

20:02.246 --> 20:03.462
Oh, no, please.

20:03.464 --> 20:04.663
No, it was your vision.

20:04.665 --> 20:06.331
Yeah, but it was your expertise.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.751
Yeah, but I'm banging
your ex-wife.

20:08.753 --> 20:12.988
All the while wondering
if she misses the python.

20:12.990 --> 20:14.456
Press the damn button.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.641
Fine.

20:17.177 --> 20:20.128
Behold the birth

20:20.130 --> 20:24.650
of The Stanhope-Schmidt
Electric Suitcase.

20:26.219 --> 20:28.136
Yes!
Yes!

20:30.808 --> 20:32.157
That's it?

20:32.159 --> 20:34.142
I mean,
I have an iPhone app

20:34.144 --> 20:36.328
that'll turn out
the house lights.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.330
No, no, no, no.
It's much more than that.

20:38.332 --> 20:39.381
Name a state.

20:39.383 --> 20:41.533
Engorged.

20:43.503 --> 20:44.503
Oh, okay.

20:44.505 --> 20:45.671
Uh, Florida.

20:48.843 --> 20:50.342
<i>Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, guys,</i>

20:50.344 --> 20:51.310
<i>I just don't get it.</i>

20:51.312 --> 20:52.745
<i>I'm going to bed.</i>

20:52.747 --> 20:54.046
<i>Oh, try Canada.</i>

20:54.048 --> 20:55.748
<i>Lights "oot."</i>

20:59.386 --> 21:02.521
<i>Okay, now... the master switch.</i>

21:03.390 --> 21:04.957
<i>Awesome!</i>
