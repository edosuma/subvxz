00:01.300 --> 00:02.934
Hi... <i>ya!</i>

00:03.001 --> 00:04.135
Let me guess.

00:04.203 --> 00:06.737
They're doing <i>A Chorus Line</i>
and you're Cassie?

00:06.805 --> 00:08.406
I, Salem, have taken up Tae Bo.

00:08.474 --> 00:12.076
Instead of conquering the world,
I'm just going to kick butt.

00:12.144 --> 00:13.044
You can't learn Tae Bo.

00:13.112 --> 00:14.779
You have no body weight
or leg extension,

00:14.847 --> 00:16.248
not to mention will or courage.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.248
Perfect.

00:17.316 --> 00:19.717
I will use that
as my daily affirmation.

00:19.785 --> 00:21.419
I think you're going
to need some help.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.123
SALEM:
Billy Blanks!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.257
I am your clay.

00:26.325 --> 00:27.425
Mold me.

00:30.495 --> 00:31.929
Now, that doesn't look so hard.

00:33.799 --> 00:34.699
(Salem yells)

00:34.766 --> 00:37.201
Salem, are you okay?

00:37.269 --> 00:38.269
(panting)

00:38.337 --> 00:39.271
(spitting)

00:39.338 --> 00:41.339
I love this sport!

00:41.407 --> 00:43.108
(sighing)

01:19.846 --> 01:21.312
Hey...

01:21.380 --> 01:23.782
do you still have
a crush on Josh?

01:23.849 --> 01:26.318
Oh, please, when was the
last time I brought <i>that</i> up?

01:26.385 --> 01:28.552
Yesterday.
What, are you wearing
wire for the Feds?

01:28.620 --> 01:30.655
Okay, so I had
a teensy crush on him,

01:30.723 --> 01:31.890
but I'm over it.

01:31.957 --> 01:32.991
Harvey's the
only guy for me.

01:33.125 --> 01:34.626
Plus, you know, Josh
isn't even that nice.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.160
JOSH:
Hi, guys.

01:36.228 --> 01:38.129
Sabrina, here's your
cappuccino, just the
way you like it,

01:38.197 --> 01:39.531
and don't worry
about the dishes.

01:39.598 --> 01:40.531
I already did them.

01:40.599 --> 01:42.000
(Josh whistling)

01:42.067 --> 01:43.835
See? What a creep.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.373
You know, we have been so busy
at the clock shop

01:48.440 --> 01:50.775
that we are really behind
on our chores.

01:50.842 --> 01:54.145
Oh, style maven B. Smith
would be horrified.

01:54.213 --> 01:55.479
I can top that.

01:55.547 --> 01:57.048
<i>I'm</i> horrified.

01:57.115 --> 01:59.750
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda,
take a look at this.

01:59.818 --> 02:01.987
Okay... turn the bowl
into an apple.

02:03.054 --> 02:04.155
Okay...

02:04.223 --> 02:05.690
the bowl was
a priceless heirloom,

02:05.791 --> 02:07.425
but... nice magic, Dreama.

02:07.492 --> 02:08.727
Wait, give it a minute.

02:08.794 --> 02:09.794
This keeps happening.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.829
I think it's because
she's nervous.

02:11.897 --> 02:13.431
Remember when I used
to get nervous

02:13.499 --> 02:15.166
and all I could zap in
were pineapples?

02:15.234 --> 02:16.367
But never the ham.

02:16.435 --> 02:18.469
I think
Dreama's suffering

02:18.537 --> 02:19.904
from a lack of magic glue.

02:19.972 --> 02:21.940
That's why her spells
don't stick.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.775
Hold the pull an extra beat.

02:28.113 --> 02:29.247
Oh, okay.

02:29.314 --> 02:30.782
Let's hurry--
Harvey's football game

02:30.850 --> 02:32.383
starts in 15 minutes,
and the sooner I get there,

02:32.451 --> 02:34.219
the sooner I can be numb
from the cold.

02:36.021 --> 02:40.024
Oh, you know, she's really
not that much of a help.

02:40.092 --> 02:41.826
(band playing, crowd cheering)

02:41.894 --> 02:43.427
Hey, did you see me
waving at you?

02:43.462 --> 02:44.829
You know,
in this temperature,

02:44.897 --> 02:46.797
it's hard to get
any lateral movement,

02:46.865 --> 02:49.000
but I got a few
up-and-down motions going.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.669
I'm sorry...
I get so into the game

02:50.736 --> 02:52.804
that I don't notice anything
around me.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.839
Imagine if I were
actually playing.

02:54.907 --> 02:57.876
Well, you want to go get
some coffee and warm up?

02:57.943 --> 02:59.144
I already told Brad
and the others

02:59.211 --> 03:00.478
I'd meet them at the Slicery,

03:00.546 --> 03:01.446
but since you sat

03:01.513 --> 03:02.913
through this whole game for me,

03:02.981 --> 03:04.949
I'm going to do something
I don't want to do for you.

03:05.016 --> 03:06.184
Let's go get coffee.

03:06.251 --> 03:08.320
You romantic, you.

03:08.387 --> 03:10.120
(acoustic guitar strumming)

03:11.623 --> 03:13.958
Hey, Sabrina,
that folk singer

03:14.026 --> 03:16.527
I'm always talking about
is playing here tonight.

03:16.595 --> 03:18.429
Bob Dylan?

03:18.497 --> 03:19.430
Let me rephrase that.

03:19.498 --> 03:20.798
The folk singer
I talk about

03:20.866 --> 03:22.800
who no one's ever heard of
is playing here tonight.

03:22.868 --> 03:24.735
Oh, well, maybe
he'll play that song

03:24.803 --> 03:26.237
no one's ever heard of.

03:26.305 --> 03:29.107
Why do people keep
coming in here?

03:29.174 --> 03:30.408
Oh, yeah,
the "Open" sign.

03:30.476 --> 03:36.014
¶ And the writing
on the tuna can said ¶

03:36.081 --> 03:38.616
¶ "Packed in water,
this dolphin is dead..." ¶

03:38.683 --> 03:40.685
(playing harmonica)

03:40.753 --> 03:42.386
And to think
I almost missed this

03:42.454 --> 03:44.522
by playing Foosball
with my friends.

03:44.589 --> 03:46.190
You can go to the Slicery
if you're not having any fun.

03:46.258 --> 03:48.660
You know, we don't have to be
together on every date.

03:48.727 --> 03:49.894
Thanks.

03:49.962 --> 03:52.563
Man, we have
a great relationship.

03:56.735 --> 04:01.139
I really hope he doesn't
sell out and go electric.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.907
If that's a
grocery list,

04:02.975 --> 04:05.143
I need my blue power drink.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.478
Sorry. Obviously, we're
behind in our chores.

04:07.546 --> 04:09.046
Just have some juice.

04:09.114 --> 04:10.915
But my punches and kicks
are powerless

04:10.982 --> 04:13.751
without that expensive
blue liquid.

04:13.819 --> 04:15.954
Look what I found
in the laundry.

04:16.021 --> 04:17.255
That's been in there

04:17.322 --> 04:19.591
since Lyndon Johnson
was president?

04:19.658 --> 04:21.059
<i>Andrew</i> Johnson.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.160
We are behind.

04:23.228 --> 04:24.729
You could just <i>zap</i>
me some of that

04:24.797 --> 04:26.564
synthetically
engineered beverage.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.433
You know what happens to witches

04:28.501 --> 04:30.435
who zap chores
in the Mortal Realm.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.169
They live happily ever after?

04:32.237 --> 04:34.271
They end up
taking everything for granted

04:34.339 --> 04:35.973
and appreciating nothing.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.408
But don't worry.
We're going to buckle down

04:37.476 --> 04:39.244
and handle this
the way any mortal would.

04:39.311 --> 04:41.379
We're hiring someone
to do our housework for us.

04:41.447 --> 04:46.317
In fact, I am going to send
the application right now.

04:50.221 --> 04:53.691
After we remove two years
of Hot Pocket crumbs

04:53.759 --> 04:55.560
from the toaster.
Hold on.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.627
That sounds dangerous.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.162
Better let an expert handle it.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.397
(slurping)

04:59.465 --> 05:02.901
(electrical crackling)

05:02.968 --> 05:05.002
(sighs):
Worth it.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.337
Ah, <i>Oliver Twist.</i>

05:06.405 --> 05:08.739
They don't write them
like that anymore, huh?

05:08.807 --> 05:10.041
You know <i>Oliver Twist?</i>

05:10.108 --> 05:11.242
That's great.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.977
My study group
just fell apart.

05:13.044 --> 05:14.245
I have this big exam.

05:14.312 --> 05:16.046
Do you think you can ask me
some questions?

05:16.114 --> 05:18.182
Sure. Be right back.

05:23.255 --> 05:25.189
Stupid pineapple.

05:25.257 --> 05:27.025
Don't be nervous.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.831
Make me read fast and good
as if my name were Evelyn Wood.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.700
Okay.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.836
(coughs)

05:40.105 --> 05:41.372
All right.

05:41.439 --> 05:43.841
Name the boys who were part of
Fagin's band of ragamuffins.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.175
Oh, that's easy, um...

05:45.243 --> 05:47.511
And which one was the most
Christ-like figure and why?

05:47.579 --> 05:51.149
So much for lobbing me
a softball to get started. Um...

05:51.216 --> 05:52.616
Yeah, you know, we might
be here all night.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.485
Maybe we should send
out for some coffee.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.791
I can't wait for our new
housekeeper to get here.

05:59.858 --> 06:02.860
I know. I'm exhausted
watching you clean so much.

06:02.928 --> 06:04.695
(lightning crashing)

06:04.763 --> 06:05.930
ALL:
Arrrrgh!

06:07.365 --> 06:10.701
I want a word
with that agency.

06:10.769 --> 06:12.670
Let's start
with the key facts.

06:12.738 --> 06:14.538
One: we don't
want you here.
(exclaiming)

06:14.606 --> 06:16.174
And two: the last time

06:16.241 --> 06:18.375
you were here,
you tried to kill us.

06:18.443 --> 06:19.377
But failed.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.411
We're on probation.

06:20.479 --> 06:23.013
We need this job
to stay out of prison.

06:25.217 --> 06:27.384
Well, they don't smell
of drink.

06:27.452 --> 06:28.920
Any weapons?

06:28.987 --> 06:31.523
Only ones that kill germs
on contact.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.491
We did accidentally
keep them locked up

06:33.559 --> 06:36.027
without any food or water
for several decades.

06:36.094 --> 06:37.996
True.

06:38.063 --> 06:40.865
Okay, boys,
you guilted us into it.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.567
(ecstatic cheering)
But...!

06:42.634 --> 06:43.967
If I am pierced by
just one cutlass,

06:44.035 --> 06:45.369
you're out of here.

06:45.437 --> 06:47.604
(ecstatic hooting and hollering)

06:47.672 --> 06:49.573
(bell rings)

06:51.009 --> 06:52.576
Well, it's Thursday.

06:52.644 --> 06:54.312
Ready to go wander
aimlessly around the mall

06:54.379 --> 06:56.314
like we always do?
I can't.

06:56.381 --> 06:57.582
Some of the guys
are going to kidnap

06:57.649 --> 07:00.184
Eastbridge's mascot
and they need me along.

07:00.251 --> 07:02.753
Why? How many people does it
take to steal a turtle?

07:02.821 --> 07:04.588
A heavily guarded turtle.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.191
Are you okay?

07:07.259 --> 07:08.826
Oh, totally, you know.

07:08.893 --> 07:10.628
That's just the kind of
relationship Harvey and I have.

07:10.695 --> 07:12.130
He does what he wants to do;
I do what I want to do,

07:12.197 --> 07:13.697
and we're both so mature
that we don't even care

07:13.765 --> 07:15.033
that we're not seeing
each other.

07:16.935 --> 07:19.337
I hope the pirates are
having a good day.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.472
Or at least
a bloodless one.

07:21.540 --> 07:25.510
Welcome to your home.

07:25.577 --> 07:27.578
Everything looks okay.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.848
The clutter's gone,
the rug's vacuumed.

07:30.916 --> 07:33.183
Nice job, boys.

07:33.251 --> 07:36.120
HILDA:
With one tiny exception.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.190
Who are
these people?

07:40.258 --> 07:42.593
Scurvy knaves
what come to pillage.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.995
Anyone who rang
the doorbell.

07:45.063 --> 07:46.497
Hi, I'm Ed McMahon.

07:46.564 --> 07:48.532
Could-could somebody untie me?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.501
Oh, of course,
Mr. McMahon.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.039
"Already a winner..."

07:55.107 --> 07:56.874
yeah, right.

07:57.843 --> 07:59.477
Bye-bye.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.413
Thank you for coming.
Stop by again sometime.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.481
Watch your step there, please.

08:03.549 --> 08:07.184
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

08:07.252 --> 08:09.353
Good first day, eh?

08:09.420 --> 08:10.655
How should I put this?

08:10.723 --> 08:12.289
<i>Nay!</i>

08:12.357 --> 08:15.225
Oh.
Oh.
Oh...

08:15.293 --> 08:17.662
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

08:17.729 --> 08:19.664
For not pointing out
that you shrunk?

08:19.731 --> 08:21.666
Thanks to your
exquisite quizzing,

08:21.733 --> 08:23.534
I aced the <i>Oliver</i>
<i>Twist</i> exam.

08:23.602 --> 08:25.369
It was fresh on my mind.

08:25.437 --> 08:27.471
Have you read
<i>Great Expectations?</i>

08:27.539 --> 08:29.173
Okay. I mean, sure.

08:29.207 --> 08:32.876
Uh, yeah, I can give you some
exquisite quizzing on that.

08:32.943 --> 08:35.746
Thank you.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.850
Ladies, ladies,
please don't fire us.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.919
They'll chain us in the dungeon
for a hundred years.

08:41.986 --> 08:44.488
Look, my allergies
will go crazy.

08:44.556 --> 08:46.390
Perhaps you don't understand.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.192
You did a very poor job.

08:49.561 --> 08:50.561
What were we thinking?

08:50.629 --> 08:51.930
They're wild maniacs.

08:51.997 --> 08:53.697
No one can train
them to keep house.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.566
We need someone
with an iron fist.

08:55.634 --> 08:57.101
We need
Norman Schwarzkopf.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.602
(gasps):
We need George Patton.

08:58.670 --> 08:59.938
We need...

09:00.005 --> 09:01.672
Excuse me,
B. Smith...

09:01.740 --> 09:03.307
We can't talk...

09:03.375 --> 09:05.209
and make centerpieces
at the same time.

09:05.277 --> 09:06.744
Later, I'll show you

09:06.812 --> 09:09.113
how to rejuvenate the edges
on your daggers.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.715
(enthusiastic murmuring)

09:11.783 --> 09:13.417
Right, sorry.

09:13.485 --> 09:14.652
Hey, Sabrina...

09:14.653 --> 09:16.120
Nice banana.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.256
I could turn it into a watch
for about ten seconds.

09:19.324 --> 09:21.025
Oh, so your magic glue
still isn't sticking?

09:21.093 --> 09:22.760
Well, on the plus side,
no pineapples.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.028
Oh, uh,
I checked my schedule.

09:25.096 --> 09:26.096
I'm not working Friday.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.631
Do you think you could
help me study then?

09:27.699 --> 09:29.066
You'll have to ask
my slave-driving boss

09:29.134 --> 09:30.300
if he can give me the night off.

09:30.368 --> 09:31.603
I'll have a word with him.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.104
Okay, but be careful
because, you know,

09:33.172 --> 09:34.972
he gets kind of violent
when he's been drinking.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.307
You can't study with him
Friday night.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.409
Aren't you going
to Harvey's game?

09:39.477 --> 09:40.645
I forgot.

09:40.712 --> 09:42.046
Harvey won't care.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.514
I mean, he hardly even notices
when I'm there.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.915
He won't mind
if I miss Just one.

09:44.983 --> 09:48.519
Sabrina,
say hello to Harry.

09:48.586 --> 09:50.955
We fixed him up
with a heat rock in my garage

09:51.022 --> 09:53.157
and you should see this guy
eat peas.

09:53.224 --> 09:55.359
You do know you have to give him
back after the game, right?

09:55.427 --> 09:56.594
I know.

09:56.661 --> 09:58.762
Here, look what I got you.

09:58.830 --> 10:02.132
Oh, it'll go perfect
with my "Beat Eastbridge" skirt.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.001
This is going to be
the best game ever.

10:04.069 --> 10:06.537
Come on, Harry.
Time for your walk.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.039
Okay, so maybe this game
does mean something to Harvey.

10:09.107 --> 10:10.674
I'll just talk with Josh.

10:10.742 --> 10:12.877
Wow, Sabrina, I just
checked my syllabus.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.279
This test counts
for half my grade.

10:15.347 --> 10:16.680
You're my lifesaver.

10:16.748 --> 10:18.148
I'll see you Friday.

10:18.216 --> 10:21.018
Do things ever
work out well for you?

10:23.955 --> 10:25.456
Wah... <i>ya!</i>

10:25.523 --> 10:27.258
Aunt Hilda,
Aunt Zelda, help!

10:27.325 --> 10:29.159
Perhaps I can be
of assistance.

10:29.227 --> 10:32.663
Perhaps I can guide you through
the philosophy of Tae Bo.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.031
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

10:34.099 --> 10:35.566
Harvey's expecting me
to be at the game

10:35.634 --> 10:37.768
but I already told Josh
I'd help him study.

10:37.836 --> 10:40.805
I see, and in this scenario,
who do you need to kick box?

10:40.873 --> 10:42.139
Forget it.
What am I going to do?

10:42.207 --> 10:44.274
I mean, my whole world
is crashing down around me

10:44.342 --> 10:45.977
and I can't think
of anything else, but...

10:46.044 --> 10:47.144
Do I smell fudge?

10:47.212 --> 10:49.379
So I don't want
to disappoint Josh

10:49.447 --> 10:52.483
but I don't want
to disappoint Harvey either.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.018
What do <i>you</i> want to do?

10:55.086 --> 10:56.253
Oh, yes,
very good, yes.
Mm-hmm.

10:56.321 --> 10:58.822
Well, I've been to every game
Westbridge has ever had,

10:58.890 --> 11:00.992
but I've never been
inside a college library.

11:01.059 --> 11:02.459
Then help Josh.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.162
Uh-huh, right, right.

11:04.229 --> 11:07.865
But... which boy needs you more?

11:07.933 --> 11:08.732
Ooh...
Oh, yes.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.202
Well, Josh could
study without me.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.336
Harvey.

11:12.404 --> 11:13.570
Harvey...
That's it.
Harvey it is.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.807
But... Harvey definitely
could play without me.

11:15.874 --> 11:17.174
Josh.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.976
Josh, yes.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
But...

11:19.044 --> 11:22.179
if go to the game, Josh
would just be inconvenienced.

11:22.247 --> 11:23.580
Harvey might be hurt.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.216
Oh...

11:25.283 --> 11:26.617
Harvey.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.184
Harvey.

11:27.252 --> 11:28.252
Josh.

11:28.319 --> 11:29.920
(gasping)
No.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.122
Okay, it's decided.

11:31.189 --> 11:33.691
I'll tell Josh tomorrow
I can't study.

11:33.759 --> 11:34.591
Mmm.
Oh.

11:34.659 --> 11:35.927
Look, as long
as we're sharing,

11:35.994 --> 11:37.895
I was wondering
if everyone could help me

11:37.963 --> 11:40.731
with a personal problem
I've been struggling with.

11:40.798 --> 11:42.033
Sure. What is it?

11:42.100 --> 11:45.369
I've got full-
blown scurvy.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.577
"I'm really sorry, Josh,
but..."

11:53.645 --> 11:55.012
No. Too high school.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.282
<i>"Je suis tres desole,</i>
<i>monsieur Josh, mais... "</i>

11:58.350 --> 11:59.383
No. Too French.

11:59.451 --> 12:00.451
Hey, Sabrina.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.220
I've reserved
a special carrel

12:02.287 --> 12:04.021
at the library tonight.

12:04.089 --> 12:05.155
I promise there will be

12:05.224 --> 12:06.524
all the water-cooler
water you can drink,

12:06.591 --> 12:08.592
and I plan to bring gum.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.927
Listen, Josh...

12:09.994 --> 12:11.228
No, no, okay, okay.

12:11.296 --> 12:12.363
Serious time here.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.764
I'm here on a scholarship,

12:13.832 --> 12:16.367
and if I don't keep my
grades up, it's gone.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.869
So I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

12:18.936 --> 12:20.871
are you sure
you don't mind?

12:20.938 --> 12:24.608
Please. Like I have
anywhere else to be.

12:26.711 --> 12:28.379
Sabrina, guess what?

12:28.447 --> 12:31.815
Strep throat is running wild
through the football team.

12:31.883 --> 12:33.217
Oh, boy.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.485
So many of the guys are sick,

12:34.552 --> 12:37.421
there's a very real possibility
that I might get to play.

12:37.489 --> 12:39.423
Tonight? Listen, Harvey...

12:39.491 --> 12:40.791
How lucky is that?

12:40.859 --> 12:43.461
I might actually get into a game
before I graduate,

12:43.529 --> 12:45.629
and my best girl
will get to see it.

12:45.697 --> 12:47.898
Yeah. How lucky is that?

12:47.966 --> 12:50.534
I got to go see how many of
the cultures came back positive.

12:55.707 --> 12:57.808
Help.

12:59.577 --> 13:00.611
Okay, so we have a plan.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.346
If Harvey gets in the game,
you'll witch-page me,

13:02.414 --> 13:03.814
and I'll zap back
from studying with Josh.

13:03.882 --> 13:04.981
Any questions?
Yes.

13:05.049 --> 13:06.918
What's a witch-pager?
This.

13:06.985 --> 13:08.719
All you have to do is think
"Sabrina," pull on your ear

13:08.787 --> 13:10.721
and it'll let me know
you want me. Try it.

13:11.789 --> 13:12.690
(giggling)

13:12.758 --> 13:15.225
Good. Now,
don't use it frivolously,

13:15.293 --> 13:17.294
because I'm very ticklish,
and it's on vibrate.

13:17.362 --> 13:18.528
Any other questions?

13:18.596 --> 13:19.930
Yes. What's football?

13:21.499 --> 13:23.968
I can't believe the library's
closed for painting.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.470
I'm sorry, certain places
should always be open,

13:26.537 --> 13:29.774
like hospitals and Denny's.

13:29.841 --> 13:30.974
Well, we can always
study in here.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.878
It's warm, and...
it's warm.

13:33.945 --> 13:35.379
(classical music playing)

13:35.447 --> 13:39.450
Ooh, it smells wonderful
in here.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.485
Yes, like steak
or prime rib or...

13:41.520 --> 13:43.720
We aren't missing
a mailman, are we?

13:43.788 --> 13:44.821
(laughing)

13:44.889 --> 13:48.024
We've been slaving
over a hot oven all day.

13:48.092 --> 13:50.561
We assumed you'd want
your meat cooked.

13:50.628 --> 13:51.862
You assumed correctly.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.097
Told you.

13:53.164 --> 13:53.998
Lucky guess.

13:54.966 --> 13:57.568
Oh, my.

13:57.636 --> 14:00.037
For tonight's dinner,

14:00.038 --> 14:04.308
we will start off
with a hardtack salad

14:04.376 --> 14:06.043
with barrel ale dressing,

14:06.111 --> 14:09.313
followed by braised seagull
<i>with</i> the head.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.415
After that...
I'm sorry.

14:11.482 --> 14:13.451
I don't know the politically
correct words to say this,

14:13.518 --> 14:15.519
but, um, do you have anything
that's a little less...

14:15.587 --> 14:16.920
pirate-y?

14:16.988 --> 14:20.391
For dessert
we've a lovely crème brûlée.

14:20.458 --> 14:21.626
That sounds wonderful.

14:21.693 --> 14:22.960
Is it homemade?

14:23.027 --> 14:23.960
I don't know.

14:24.028 --> 14:25.862
I'll go untie
your neighbor and ask.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.231
Remember...

14:27.298 --> 14:28.899
baby steps.

14:28.966 --> 14:30.668
(crowd cheering)

14:34.772 --> 14:36.340
Excuse me.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.309
If a person's sitting
on the bench down there,

14:38.376 --> 14:40.477
he's not in the game, right?

14:44.148 --> 14:46.049
Excuse me.

14:46.117 --> 14:47.418
I'd say we're done here.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.387
Oh, yes. Now is
there anything else

14:49.454 --> 14:51.688
I should know about
<i>Great Expectations?</i>

14:51.756 --> 14:52.889
Only that I have them

14:52.957 --> 14:55.159
and am consequently
always disappointed.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.860
(tapping on window)

14:56.928 --> 14:57.895
Oh, hey, look
who's here.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.398
Come on in.
Come on. Huh.

15:00.498 --> 15:02.499
Hey.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.268
Uh, everyone, this is Sabrina.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.303
Sabrina, this is everyone.

15:06.371 --> 15:07.771
Good. I've always wanted
to meet "everyone."

15:07.838 --> 15:08.739
(laughing)

15:08.806 --> 15:09.740
So where
are you guys headed?

15:09.807 --> 15:11.108
We're going back
to the apartment

15:11.176 --> 15:14.478
for Chinese food,
but we could stop and share.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.647
Well, I know it's kind of late,
but would you like...?
Food!

15:17.682 --> 15:19.350
Oh, good timing.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.284
(screaming happily)

15:22.653 --> 15:25.423
I'm sorry. I thought
we did something good.

15:30.862 --> 15:33.096
SABRINA:
This is so fun.

15:33.164 --> 15:35.199
At home we have to eat
Chinese food off of dishes.

15:35.266 --> 15:36.634
If you like this,

15:36.701 --> 15:38.402
you'd love
my dorm mac and cheese.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.837
I pour water into the box,
shake and eat.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.039
Or plateless
tuna salad--

15:42.107 --> 15:45.042
bite of tuna, lick
of mayonnaise, bite of bread.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.576
Or grilled cheese
made with an iron.

15:46.644 --> 15:49.146
Or pancakes grilled
on a heating pad.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.015
Nah, I've never tried it either.

15:52.083 --> 15:53.584
I was just wondering if you had.

15:55.486 --> 15:58.055
All right, he's in.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.790
We have to wait to find out

15:59.858 --> 16:02.259
if he'll ever
come out of the coma.

16:02.327 --> 16:05.028
(laughing)

16:05.096 --> 16:07.130
(sobbing)

16:07.198 --> 16:08.465
Excuse me.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.035
Go Harvey.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.606
Sabrina, she was talking
about a soap opera.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.141
Sabrina?

16:19.177 --> 16:21.478
Good. You're here.

16:21.546 --> 16:23.414
Harvey just stood up, and
any minute he'll be...

16:24.849 --> 16:26.383
Done with his water?

16:26.451 --> 16:27.551
Sorry.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.819
I'll be more careful.

16:28.887 --> 16:32.122
That's okay. At least
no one had time to miss me.

16:35.727 --> 16:37.527
Sabrina?

16:37.595 --> 16:39.263
Lose something?

16:39.330 --> 16:40.764
No, but I found something.

16:43.501 --> 16:44.535
A pineapple?

16:44.602 --> 16:45.802
A perfectly good pineapple.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.372
You know, people throw
away the darndest things.

16:48.439 --> 16:50.107
Stupid nerves.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.076
Mm...

16:52.144 --> 16:54.378
That was <i>delicious.</i>

16:54.445 --> 16:56.246
I don't know how
to thank you.

16:56.314 --> 17:00.384
You can start by taking
your elbows off the table.

17:00.451 --> 17:01.351
Quite rude.

17:01.419 --> 17:02.486
I'll drink to that.

17:02.553 --> 17:03.587
No!

17:03.654 --> 17:05.188
That's your finger bowl.

17:05.256 --> 17:08.724
I could have told
you that, Hilda.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.527
And could you please
not speak with your mouth full?

17:10.595 --> 17:12.162
This will wash it down.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.563
(sighs)

17:13.631 --> 17:16.098
Baby steps.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.500
Getting up...

17:19.170 --> 17:20.037
...walking...

17:20.105 --> 17:21.070
(gasping)

17:21.138 --> 17:22.606
He's on the field.

17:22.674 --> 17:24.308
When did Dickens die?

17:24.376 --> 17:26.042
In 1870 of a stroke.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.778
(laughing)

17:28.880 --> 17:30.847
I think Dickens
would have us laugh

17:30.916 --> 17:32.249
in the face of death.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.417
Anyone with me?

17:34.519 --> 17:36.520
Bathroom.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.021
All right, this is it.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.523
He's on the field.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.525
He's chasing
his gum wrapper.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.093
He got it. Bye.

17:45.163 --> 17:46.997
Whew! I would've
been out sooner, but, uh,

17:46.998 --> 17:48.465
this was clogging up the sink.

17:48.532 --> 17:49.600
Another pineapple?

17:49.668 --> 17:52.303
Yeah, maybe they're
on sale someplace.

17:52.370 --> 17:53.703
(laughing)

17:53.771 --> 17:56.640
"On sale," that's a good one.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.774
I'll be right back.

17:57.842 --> 17:59.276
Anyone need anything
from the bathroom?

18:00.778 --> 18:02.946
I like her.

18:03.014 --> 18:05.416
I'm sorry. I thought
for sure that he...

18:05.484 --> 18:07.151
that's it. I'm turning
this thing off.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.885
There's only two minutes
left in the game.

18:08.953 --> 18:10.086
Harvey won't be playing.

18:10.154 --> 18:11.622
And if I leave for the bathroom
one more time,

18:11.689 --> 18:13.924
I go from being quirky to sad.

18:13.991 --> 18:18.028
ANNOUNCER:
And halfback Jonathan Shapiro
is out of the game.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.764
Taking his place
will be Harvey Kinkle.

18:20.832 --> 18:22.800
Yay!

18:22.934 --> 18:25.769
Boo!

18:27.304 --> 18:29.973
Sabrina?

18:31.175 --> 18:32.076
No fruit?

18:32.143 --> 18:33.643
I was in the bathroom.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.845
Why would I have fruit?

18:35.913 --> 18:38.048
You've obviously had
too much moo goo.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.116
Come on, I'm
walking you home.

18:40.184 --> 18:42.753
There's a long pass
and Kinkle catches it!

18:42.820 --> 18:44.388
Kinkle straight into
the end zone!

18:44.456 --> 18:46.924
And Harvey Kinkle
saves the day!

18:46.992 --> 18:49.560
Oh! He's turned this
from a humiliating loss

18:49.627 --> 18:53.163
into a... slightly less
humiliating loss.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.269
I got to get to my girl.

18:59.337 --> 19:00.671
Please let this work.

19:00.738 --> 19:03.574
MAN:
Hey, Harvey!

19:05.477 --> 19:07.677
Uh-oh.

19:07.745 --> 19:10.614
No glue.

19:12.016 --> 19:13.617
Hey, where
did Sabrina go?

19:13.685 --> 19:15.452
She had to go home.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.387
She's sick. Yeah.

19:17.455 --> 19:19.123
Must've come up fast.

19:19.190 --> 19:20.156
Yes.

19:20.224 --> 19:21.591
I'd better go see
if she's okay.

19:21.659 --> 19:23.394
N-n...

19:26.330 --> 19:28.365
This coffee is wonderful.

19:28.432 --> 19:29.833
Amen.

19:29.901 --> 19:32.569
Oh, and the decorative doily
enhances it so.

19:32.636 --> 19:35.973
Presentation,
presentation, presentation.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.842
Gentlemen,
we have good news.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.679
You're permanently hired.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.049
So that means <i>no prison.</i>

19:46.116 --> 19:47.551
Yo ho ho!

19:47.618 --> 19:50.287
Listen, we've talked it over...

19:50.355 --> 19:51.588
Aye.

19:51.656 --> 19:52.923
Aye, we have.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.325
And we've decided
that with all of our skills,

19:55.427 --> 19:58.429
we need to work for people
who have taste and breeding.

19:58.496 --> 20:00.296
Someone classy.

20:00.364 --> 20:01.331
Yeah, so...

20:01.399 --> 20:03.433
thanks, but no thanks.

20:03.501 --> 20:04.467
Yeah.

20:04.535 --> 20:06.103
No, please,
don't get up...

20:06.237 --> 20:08.572
not that you would.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.807
We'll show
ourselves out.

20:13.077 --> 20:14.912
I don't think I've
ever been fired

20:14.980 --> 20:16.279
by an employee before.

20:16.347 --> 20:19.216
I'll never trust a man
wearing a bandanna again.

20:19.283 --> 20:21.518
But it is good coffee.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.721
Huh? A goat?

20:23.788 --> 20:25.255
Yes. If everyone
would just buy a goat,

20:25.323 --> 20:26.623
we could eliminate
leaf-blowers

20:26.691 --> 20:27.957
and help stop
global warming.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.160
Thanks for helping me study.

20:30.227 --> 20:31.361
You're welcome,
and maybe someday

20:31.429 --> 20:33.163
you can admit I'm right
about the goat thing.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.098
(laughs)

20:37.068 --> 20:39.069
HARVEY:
You don't look sick to me.

20:41.071 --> 20:42.172
Harvey, wait.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.979
I'm sorry, but we
have never seen

20:49.047 --> 20:51.581
such a poorly
managed household.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.117
Lord knows we've tried,

20:53.184 --> 20:54.551
but I don't think
there's any hope

20:54.618 --> 20:56.653
for you people.
None.

20:56.721 --> 20:58.822
Never have we encountered
a family

20:58.890 --> 21:01.992
with such a stunning lack
of decorum--

21:02.060 --> 21:03.426
dogs running wild,

21:03.494 --> 21:05.529
your children quite unruly.

21:05.596 --> 21:08.332
And I won't even touch
the subject of your teeth.

21:08.399 --> 21:09.933
Ugh!
Ugh!

21:10.001 --> 21:11.234
We quit.

21:11.302 --> 21:14.371
Gentlemen?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.406
QUEEN:
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>I've ever been fired</i>

21:16.474 --> 21:19.576
<i>by an employee before.</i>
