WEBVTT

00:02.846 --> 00:05.826
Why don't we see
if we can spot Prince Charming?

00:05.826 --> 00:06.995
Hi, I'm Gypsy.

00:06.995 --> 00:08.331
I love Wolverine.

00:08.331 --> 00:09.668
- Oh!

00:09.668 --> 00:10.836
Some call me Logan.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.047
But you can call me Scott.

00:12.047 --> 00:13.634
- A girl can do a lot
with a red wig.

00:13.634 --> 00:16.765
- There's only one redhead
for Wolverine: Jean Grey.

00:16.765 --> 00:18.226
<i>- How old are you?</i>
<i>- She's 15.</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:20.063
<i>Born in 1995.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:23.152
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>I was born in 1993.</i>

00:23.152 --> 00:25.031
And one of those, too.

00:25.031 --> 00:27.996
<i>Hey, it's Gypsy</i>
<i>from the convention.</i>

00:27.996 --> 00:29.456
<i>So 18 years old,</i>

00:29.456 --> 00:31.043
<i>and you just got</i>
<i>your own Facebook.</i>

00:31.043 --> 00:32.505
<i>I'll give you</i>
<i>my address</i>

00:32.505 --> 00:34.133
<i>if you ever want</i>
<i>to send me a present.</i>

00:34.133 --> 00:36.470
It's me, Gypsy.
- But you're walking.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.308
<i>I am in love</i>
<i>and running away</i>

00:38.308 --> 00:39.686
<i>to get married and have kids,</i>

00:39.686 --> 00:41.188
<i>and there's nothing</i>
<i>you can do to stop me.</i>

00:42.817 --> 00:45.488
<i>Love, Gypsy,</i>
<i>your 19-year-old daughter.</i>

00:45.488 --> 00:46.783
- Come on.

00:46.783 --> 00:49.455
Come on, let's go home.

01:52.414 --> 01:53.917
Well...

01:53.917 --> 01:56.882
I'm feeling better now.
Let's go do your bath.

01:56.882 --> 01:58.719
- I'm not really that dirty.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.888
- Let's not argue.

01:59.888 --> 02:02.685
I don't want your port
getting infected.

02:02.685 --> 02:04.313
Come on.

02:04.313 --> 02:06.358
Okay, Mom.

02:14.793 --> 02:17.255
Come on, sing along with me.

02:17.255 --> 02:19.384
- I'm not really
in a singing mood today, Mom.

02:19.384 --> 02:23.226
Oh, my baby's not
in a singing mood.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.648
Come on.

02:28.695 --> 02:30.073
Oh.

02:30.073 --> 02:32.160
Oh, be careful!

02:33.580 --> 02:36.085
- I'm not a baby.

02:36.085 --> 02:39.216
- Oh, no.

02:39.216 --> 02:42.138
I must have lost count
on my calendar.

02:42.138 --> 02:43.934
Why didn't you tell me?

02:43.934 --> 02:46.313
You know this happens
once a month.

02:46.313 --> 02:48.735
Ooh, I'll have to clean this.

02:48.735 --> 02:52.200
I have to clean everything.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.789
- I'm real sorry, Mom.

03:09.401 --> 03:11.573
- Remind me when you last ate?

03:11.573 --> 03:14.036
- Breakfast, three hours ago.

03:14.036 --> 03:15.371
Two poached eggs.

03:15.371 --> 03:17.417
Soft, like you told me.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.129
Your blood sugar
shouldn't be this high.

03:19.129 --> 03:21.342
As I have repeatedly told you,
Mrs. Blanchard,

03:21.342 --> 03:23.137
you need to be getting in
at least 30 minutes

03:23.137 --> 03:25.475
of walking a day
to start managing this.

03:25.475 --> 03:27.605
We're gonna have
to put you on insulin,

03:27.605 --> 03:29.149
and you're gonna have
to check your own blood sugar

03:29.149 --> 03:30.569
several times daily.

03:30.569 --> 03:32.782
At least until we can get you
under some control.

03:32.782 --> 03:34.577
- Wait, is that bad?

03:34.577 --> 03:36.413
- Oh, sweet pea.

03:36.413 --> 03:38.585
I'm sure everything
will come out all right.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.547
It always does
when we're together.

03:40.547 --> 03:43.344
It's not great.
Your mom is really sick.

03:45.014 --> 03:47.227
- Is she...

03:47.227 --> 03:49.398
- is she gonna die?
- Oh, no.

03:49.398 --> 03:51.026
- Worst-case scenario,
she could.

03:51.026 --> 03:53.239
Type 2 diabetes can be fatal.

03:53.239 --> 03:54.992
- Oh, you're upsetting
my daughter.

03:54.992 --> 03:57.288
- I'm sorry,
that's not my intention.

03:57.288 --> 03:58.750
But this is serious.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.796
You're gonna need
daily injections.

04:00.796 --> 04:03.217
- Oh...
Oh, sweet pea.

04:03.217 --> 04:04.721
She hates needles.

04:04.721 --> 04:06.558
She's gonna have
to get over that

04:06.558 --> 04:08.102
so she can help me.

04:08.102 --> 04:10.894
It's not getting shots herself
she hates so much.

04:10.894 --> 04:13.572
It's seeing her mama
get punctured in any way.

04:13.572 --> 04:17.620
I'm sorry, Gypsy, baby,
but I'm gonna need you now

04:17.620 --> 04:20.375
every single day.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.090
Will you lift up
your shirt for me?

04:25.094 --> 04:28.518
So you'll grab
a piece of the abdomen...

04:28.518 --> 04:30.146
and then pierce it
with the needle.

04:31.482 --> 04:33.110
And then inject.

04:59.079 --> 05:00.081
Oh!

05:05.049 --> 05:06.928
Yay, yes!

05:06.928 --> 05:09.517
Oh, don't worry--
it's sugar-free.

05:09.517 --> 05:13.357
Oh, I spent a long time
thinking about what to get you.

05:13.357 --> 05:15.612
- 'Cause I'm finally 18 now?

05:15.612 --> 05:18.033
I guess I lost track.
- Oh, don't you get smart.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.369
You remember what I told you?

05:19.369 --> 05:21.541
That was a typo on that card.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.753
You were born in 1995,

05:23.753 --> 05:25.841
not 1991.

05:25.841 --> 05:29.682
You think I don't remember
the day you were born?

05:29.682 --> 05:31.310
- No, of course not.

05:31.310 --> 05:32.730
I'm sorry.

05:32.730 --> 05:35.318
Just, um--18.

05:35.318 --> 05:38.575
It feels very, um...

05:38.575 --> 05:39.869
grown up.

05:39.869 --> 05:41.831
- Well, you're not like
other 18-year-olds.

05:41.831 --> 05:43.877
You'll always be
my little baby.

05:45.254 --> 05:48.219
But I hate seeing you
so lonesome.

05:48.219 --> 05:49.805
Ooh, you're not gonna believe
what I got you

05:49.805 --> 05:51.433
for your birthday.

05:51.433 --> 05:54.439
Ooh!

06:08.300 --> 06:10.346
Come on.

06:14.187 --> 06:15.941
Okay.

06:15.941 --> 06:17.695
Here.

06:23.205 --> 06:25.669
Oh, my gosh!

06:25.669 --> 06:28.132
Guinea pigs!

06:28.132 --> 06:30.554
- Oh, oh!

06:30.554 --> 06:31.973
Hi!

06:34.394 --> 06:36.733
Oh, I'm gonna
name this one Moo Moo

06:36.733 --> 06:38.402
and this one Boo Boo.

06:38.402 --> 06:41.074
Thank you, Mom!

06:41.074 --> 06:42.619
Thank you!
Hi, little guys.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.625
- Oh.
I'm gonna go take my nap.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.378
You want me to put them
in their new cage?

06:47.378 --> 06:49.007
- No, no, that's okay.
They can stay out.

06:49.007 --> 06:51.219
Aww.

06:51.219 --> 06:52.765
Thank you.

06:52.765 --> 06:54.267
Thank you, Mom.

06:54.267 --> 06:56.229
You're welcome.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.767
I bet you'd like to go outside

07:14.767 --> 07:17.523
and get a little
birthday sun, huh?

07:19.234 --> 07:20.862
Okay.

07:20.862 --> 07:23.492
This is very important, okay?

07:23.492 --> 07:25.329
We have to be quiet.

07:25.329 --> 07:27.208
We can't wake her up.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.545
Okay.

07:28.545 --> 07:30.841
Okay, stay there.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.004
Hey.

07:50.004 --> 07:52.509
- Hey.

07:58.688 --> 08:00.650
You look good.

08:06.077 --> 08:08.165
Do you know how they're doing?

08:08.165 --> 08:10.879
- They seem fine.

08:10.879 --> 08:12.131
I got lunch ready.
You coming in?

08:12.131 --> 08:15.346
- Yeah, I might go
and say hi to her first.

08:15.346 --> 08:18.603
I just worry about her.
She doesn't have any friends.

08:18.603 --> 08:20.064
- Do you have to?

08:20.064 --> 08:23.153
If you go over there,
you'll get trapped all day.

08:23.153 --> 08:25.659
- I'll be a minute.

08:25.659 --> 08:27.621
Hey, Gypsy!

08:28.623 --> 08:30.417
Um...

08:30.417 --> 08:33.508
I'm gonna try and transfer
out of Twain next year.

08:33.508 --> 08:34.885
Or, I was.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.764
But I met this guy,

08:36.764 --> 08:39.309
and he, like, lives here,
so I don't know.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.732
Maybe I don't want to move
to Kansas City anymore.

08:41.732 --> 08:44.320
Maybe I shouldn't go far.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.074
- How did you meet him?

08:46.074 --> 08:47.953
- Um, it was online.

08:47.953 --> 08:49.582
I don't know, I feel
kind of weird about that.

08:49.582 --> 08:51.711
I'd never done it before,
but my roommate?

08:51.711 --> 08:54.048
She's an Evangelical,
and she signed me up

08:54.048 --> 08:56.971
for this thing called
"ChristianDatingForFree. com."

08:56.971 --> 08:58.516
It's super dorky.

08:58.516 --> 09:02.315
I thought online dating
was for serial killers, but...

09:02.315 --> 09:03.317
- Oh.

09:03.317 --> 09:04.528
- Jaden's not that.

09:04.528 --> 09:06.866
I mean, he's got a good job
in construction.

09:06.866 --> 09:07.993
Or, he did.

09:07.993 --> 09:09.663
He got sick,
so they kind of fired him.

09:09.663 --> 09:11.792
- Can I see it?
- See what?

09:11.792 --> 09:13.630
- Oh, the website.

09:13.630 --> 09:14.965
- Oh, yeah, sure.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.428
Hold on, here.
- Come here, Boo Boo.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.562
Um...

09:21.562 --> 09:24.735
it's cool 'cause it shows you
who's nearby.

09:24.735 --> 09:27.574
Um, I thought I knew everybody
in this town,

09:27.574 --> 09:30.705
but I never met Jaden before.

09:30.705 --> 09:33.043
Look.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.505
- Huh.

09:34.505 --> 09:38.513
- Oh, my God,
is that Matt Sutherland?

09:38.513 --> 09:39.515
No way.

09:39.515 --> 09:42.478
The lawnmower guy?

09:42.478 --> 09:44.942
Oh, my God, it says
he's into anime.

09:44.942 --> 09:46.987
He's one of <i>those</i> guys.

09:57.258 --> 09:59.178
- Oh.

09:59.178 --> 10:00.431
Hello?

10:00.431 --> 10:02.476
<i>Hi, Dee Dee.</i>
<i>It's me.</i>

10:02.476 --> 10:04.940
- Oh, is this about--
<i>- Put Gypsy on.</i>

10:04.940 --> 10:07.445
<i>I want to say happy birthday.</i>

10:10.033 --> 10:13.331
- Honestly, she doesn't know
it's her birthday.

10:13.331 --> 10:15.670
<i>What?</i>

10:15.670 --> 10:18.133
I don't want
to get her hopes up,

10:18.133 --> 10:22.141
give her anxiety about
how many years she's got left.

10:22.141 --> 10:24.521
All the doctors say
it's the best thing to do

10:24.521 --> 10:26.191
in her condition.

10:26.191 --> 10:29.573
<i>What's her condition?</i>
<i>Did something new happen?</i>

10:29.573 --> 10:31.034
<i>I-I thought you said</i>

10:31.034 --> 10:33.121
<i>she'd been doing all right</i>
<i>lately, you know?</i>

10:33.121 --> 10:36.629
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>I should know?</i>

10:37.881 --> 10:39.551
- Oh.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.097
Oh, Rod,
it's the doctor's office.

10:42.097 --> 10:44.310
- I gotta take this call.
<i>- Dee Dee, I really wish</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:45.605
<i>you would tell me</i>
<i>what's going on--</i>

10:45.605 --> 10:46.941
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

10:46.941 --> 10:49.403
<i>Am I speaking</i>
<i>to Claudinea Blanchard?</i>

10:49.403 --> 10:51.324
- Why, yes, it is.

10:51.324 --> 10:53.203
<i>This is</i>
<i>Dr. Buchanan's office</i>

10:53.203 --> 10:54.497
<i>confirming the schedule</i>

10:54.497 --> 10:56.292
<i>for the eardrum lancing</i>
<i>next month</i>

10:56.292 --> 10:59.967
<i>for her new ear tubes,</i>
<i>and I noticed in her file</i>

10:59.967 --> 11:02.263
<i>it says her birthday</i>
<i>is in 1995</i>

11:02.263 --> 11:05.477
<i>even though on her Medicaid</i>
<i>card it says 1991.</i>

11:05.477 --> 11:06.647
- Yes, that's correct.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.237
<i>That would still mean</i>
<i>she turned 18 this week...</i>

11:10.237 --> 11:11.489
<i>Which means</i>

11:11.489 --> 11:13.076
<i>we're going to</i>
<i>need Gypsy to come in</i>

11:13.076 --> 11:15.163
<i>and give her signed consent.</i>

11:16.124 --> 11:17.502
- Uh...

11:17.502 --> 11:19.548
<i>She's an adult now, after all.</i>

11:19.548 --> 11:21.594
<i>So unless there are</i>
<i>guardianship papers,</i>

11:21.594 --> 11:22.679
<i>Ms. Blanchard,</i>

11:22.679 --> 11:24.181
<i>Gypsy's now old enough</i>

11:24.181 --> 11:25.810
<i>that we have to get</i>
<i>her informed consent</i>

11:25.810 --> 11:28.315
<i>- on invasive procedures.</i>
- Oh... my... God.

11:28.315 --> 11:30.068
Understood.

11:30.068 --> 11:32.197
Uh, I'll get it taken care of

11:32.197 --> 11:34.786
as soon as the lawyer
can see me.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.211
- Oh.
- Look at him.

11:39.211 --> 11:41.049
Wow.

11:41.049 --> 11:43.011
- Oh, Mom.
- Hi, Dee Dee.

11:43.011 --> 11:44.347
- Well, hello, Miss Lacey.

11:44.347 --> 11:47.227
So nice to see
your pretty face around here.

11:47.227 --> 11:49.440
- Yeah, I couldn't resist
saying hi

11:49.440 --> 11:50.818
to Gypsy's new little friend.

11:50.818 --> 11:53.156
- Oh, I understand.

11:53.156 --> 11:55.035
Heard something about
a new boyfriend.

11:55.035 --> 11:58.124
Boy, you do
go through 'em, hmm?

11:58.124 --> 12:00.087
- I guess.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.176
- I thought I told you
those are indoor pets.

12:03.176 --> 12:05.640
There's wild animals out here.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.142
Snap Boo Boo up.

12:07.142 --> 12:10.148
We'd find his head
out on the lawn.

12:10.148 --> 12:12.862
He's safer inside.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.073
Okay.

12:14.073 --> 12:15.576
That's a good point.

12:15.576 --> 12:18.415
I should go anyway.
My mom's waiting for me.

12:18.415 --> 12:19.793
- Oh, do say hello for us.

12:19.793 --> 12:21.964
- Yeah, I will.
Okay.

12:21.964 --> 12:23.551
Bye, Boo Boo.

12:23.551 --> 12:25.722
See ya.

12:25.722 --> 12:28.018
- Bye, Lacey.

12:29.437 --> 12:31.734
You shouldn't be
outside without me!

12:31.734 --> 12:33.612
- But, Mom, I was just
showing Lacey--

12:33.612 --> 12:35.825
- No, there are men
who stalk neighborhoods

12:35.825 --> 12:37.036
looking for kids!

12:37.036 --> 12:39.081
They push you in a big van
and that's it!

12:39.081 --> 12:41.044
- I was just
on the front porch, Mom!

12:41.044 --> 12:44.258
- She shouldn't be talking
to you about that stuff!

12:44.258 --> 12:46.137
About men.
- Well, I asked her about it.

12:46.137 --> 12:48.141
- You shouldn't be doing that!

12:48.141 --> 12:49.435
I'm gonna go talk to her.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.648
- No, Mom,
please don't do that.

12:51.648 --> 12:53.778
I was just--she was just
telling me how nice he was!

12:53.778 --> 12:55.698
You need to calm down!

12:55.698 --> 12:57.242
"Calm down"?

12:57.242 --> 12:59.246
I never once
disrespected my mama

12:59.246 --> 13:01.710
the way you do
nearly every day!

13:01.710 --> 13:04.633
I prided myself on being
a good daughter!

13:04.633 --> 13:07.304
Now you sit here
and you think about that!

13:07.304 --> 13:09.643
No...

13:11.395 --> 13:14.360
I never get to see her anymore.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.445
Quiet!

14:22.245 --> 14:25.168
- Remind me-- dad's not
in the picture, right?

14:25.168 --> 14:28.383
That's right.

14:28.383 --> 14:32.182
- Well, in order to execute
a legal guardianship,

14:32.182 --> 14:35.480
we would need a local doctor
to sign an affidavit

14:35.480 --> 14:37.025
about her diagnoses...

14:37.025 --> 14:38.403
- Oh, yes.

14:38.403 --> 14:40.574
And then there is
the hearing to get through.

14:40.574 --> 14:42.537
- Mm.

14:44.456 --> 14:46.503
- That is such a lovely bunny.

14:46.503 --> 14:48.674
I'm gonna get one
just like that for my niece.

14:51.178 --> 14:54.018
I'm just gonna ask you
a few questions, all right?

14:55.353 --> 14:57.065
Can you read?

14:57.065 --> 14:58.317
- Yes.

14:58.317 --> 15:00.781
Some, but...

15:00.781 --> 15:03.327
but not good.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.212
Good.
Okay, can you write?

15:08.212 --> 15:10.341
- I can sign my name.

15:10.341 --> 15:13.724
- Say you were home alone
and feeling sick.

15:13.724 --> 15:16.270
What would you do?

15:16.270 --> 15:19.234
- I would... call my mom.

15:19.234 --> 15:21.948
- And if your mom
didn't answer?

15:23.076 --> 15:25.581
- I would call 911.

15:25.581 --> 15:26.666
Okay.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.837
And if you ended up
at the hospital

15:28.837 --> 15:30.800
and they said
that you were having

15:30.800 --> 15:33.597
a severe allergic reaction,

15:33.597 --> 15:36.686
what would you say
that you needed?

15:36.686 --> 15:40.360
- I would say
that I needed an EpiPen.

15:41.530 --> 15:43.366
And that also

15:43.366 --> 15:46.080
to please try
and call my mom again.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.792
Good.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.046
Good.

15:50.046 --> 15:52.593
Mrs. Blanchard,
I need to explain something

15:52.593 --> 15:54.681
about Missouri state law.

15:54.681 --> 15:57.854
In order to obtain
a guardianship
over your daughter,

15:57.854 --> 16:00.275
we would need
to convince a judge

16:00.275 --> 16:02.028
that she's incapacitated.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.116
- Well, she's in a wheelchair.

16:04.116 --> 16:07.915
- The case law's very specific.
Physical deficits don't matter.

16:07.915 --> 16:09.293
What the court
would want to know

16:09.293 --> 16:12.758
is if Gypsy could think
for herself.

16:14.804 --> 16:16.473
- Well, all her doctors say

16:16.473 --> 16:19.522
that she's... delayed.

16:20.816 --> 16:22.778
I usually say, you know,

16:22.778 --> 16:25.743
she's got the mind
of a seven-year-old.

16:25.743 --> 16:27.663
- I understand
you feel that way,

16:27.663 --> 16:30.920
but your daughter can answer
specific questions

16:30.920 --> 16:33.007
about her health.

16:33.007 --> 16:34.928
- What--
- A judge would ask her

16:34.928 --> 16:37.516
all the same things
that I just did.

16:37.516 --> 16:39.311
I'm afraid there's just no way

16:39.311 --> 16:41.357
you'd be awarded
a guardianship.

16:41.357 --> 16:44.488
In the eyes of the law,
she's her own person.

16:45.490 --> 16:47.369
I see.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.793
Well, thank you.

16:54.007 --> 16:56.428
I'm sorry
I can't be more help.

16:56.428 --> 16:58.391
It's fine.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.109
I don't know why she was
asking you all those questions.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.070
I'm your mother.

17:05.070 --> 17:06.825
- I was only being honest.

17:06.825 --> 17:08.619
- Oh, I know, Gypsy Bee,

17:08.619 --> 17:10.749
but we need those papers.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.877
Your doctor...

17:12.877 --> 17:15.509
Medicaid,
Make-A-Wish Foundation,

17:15.509 --> 17:18.263
disability, all of it.

17:18.263 --> 17:20.894
We could be homeless again.

17:20.894 --> 17:23.441
We could be in big trouble.

17:23.441 --> 17:26.113
Big trouble.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.907
What does-- what does that mean?

17:27.907 --> 17:30.664
I'll explain it to you later.

17:30.664 --> 17:33.252
Oh, I feel terrible.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.256
I'm sorry, Mama.

17:35.256 --> 17:38.054
Why am I always
at the bottom of my list?

17:38.054 --> 17:41.352
I feel like
no one cares for me.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.022
- Mom, why don't you sit down?

17:43.022 --> 17:44.692
- Oh...
- Come on.

17:44.692 --> 17:46.487
You'll sit down,
you'll feel better.

17:46.487 --> 17:49.159
Let me help you.

17:49.159 --> 17:51.288
Here.
- Ohh...

17:52.708 --> 17:54.545
Oh...

17:54.545 --> 17:56.465
Ah, that does feel better.

17:56.465 --> 17:58.929
- What do we have
to get today?

17:58.929 --> 18:02.227
- Oh, just...

18:02.227 --> 18:04.314
Oh...

18:05.693 --> 18:08.615
Oh...

18:08.615 --> 18:10.703
- Do you want me to go
and shop the list?

18:10.703 --> 18:13.792
- Oh, just...

18:13.792 --> 18:15.921
Just sit with me
for a minute.

18:15.921 --> 18:17.424
- It's okay, I can do it.

18:17.424 --> 18:19.637
I'll come right back,
I promise.

18:19.637 --> 18:21.558
- Oh...

18:21.558 --> 18:23.018
okay.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.229
- Here, hold Bunny.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.150
I'll be right back,
I promise.

18:26.150 --> 18:28.739
- Okay.

18:41.263 --> 18:42.725
Hello, there.

18:42.725 --> 18:44.812
Are you lost?

18:44.812 --> 18:46.148
- Oh, no.

18:46.148 --> 18:48.319
Actually, um, I was hoping

18:48.319 --> 18:50.239
you could help me
with something.

18:50.239 --> 18:52.536
I'm on kind of
a secret mission.

18:52.536 --> 18:55.249
Okay, is it black ops?

18:55.249 --> 18:57.295
Sorta.

18:57.295 --> 18:59.926
You see, it's my mom's
birthday soon,

18:59.926 --> 19:03.098
and, well, she's just
the best mom
in the whole world,

19:03.098 --> 19:04.936
and I want to do something
really special for her.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.523
And she keeps saying

19:06.523 --> 19:08.819
that she really,
really wants a laptop.

19:08.819 --> 19:11.574
Um, how much is one?

19:11.574 --> 19:14.079
I don't have a lot of money.

19:14.079 --> 19:17.503
- Well, we have these
for $169.99.

19:17.503 --> 19:20.634
- That's-- okay, yeah,
I have enough for that.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.019
Oh, c-could you-- could you
count that out for me?

19:26.019 --> 19:27.523
Sure, sweetie.

19:34.787 --> 19:35.914
- Oh.

19:37.125 --> 19:40.256
- You know, your mom
is very lucky to have you.

19:40.256 --> 19:42.135
Nobody buys me any computers.

19:42.135 --> 19:45.266
- I'm very lucky
to have her, too.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.899
There you go, sweetie.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.569
- Thank you so--
thank you very much.

19:50.569 --> 19:52.698
Have a good day.
- You, too.

20:26.431 --> 20:27.768
<i>Gypsy Rose Blanchard,</i>

20:27.768 --> 20:31.693
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the customer service desk.</i>

20:31.693 --> 20:33.863
<i>Gypsy Rose Blanchard.</i>

20:35.157 --> 20:37.453
I'm so sorry
that I took so long.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.040
I--I couldn't find anything.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.669
I just-- I got so lost.

20:40.669 --> 20:42.881
I couldn't even find
the pharmacy and I just--

20:42.881 --> 20:45.887
- Young lady, your mother's
not feeling well.

20:48.267 --> 20:52.693
- It's okay.
I just need to go home.

20:52.693 --> 20:54.154
- Oh.

20:54.154 --> 20:56.241
Um...

20:56.241 --> 20:58.370
do you just want
to go to the car?

20:58.370 --> 21:00.332
Yeah, let's go.

21:00.332 --> 21:01.878
Yeah.

21:01.878 --> 21:03.297
Just hold on to me.

21:07.681 --> 21:08.767
- Okay.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.896
- Mom, I can't.

21:10.896 --> 21:14.027
Here.

21:14.027 --> 21:16.239
Hold it.

21:19.789 --> 21:21.667
You remember
in "The Hunger Games"

21:21.667 --> 21:25.007
how Katniss volunteers
for her sister?

21:25.007 --> 21:28.472
Well, Katniss doesn't want
to go to the Hunger Games.

21:28.472 --> 21:31.729
She does it 'cause she loves
her little sister.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.864
Do you love me?

21:39.369 --> 21:41.791
Come on.

21:49.598 --> 21:51.936
Yep.

21:53.982 --> 21:56.529
Oh.

21:56.529 --> 21:59.117
Yeah, that's it.

21:59.117 --> 22:00.704
Oh, that's a good girl.

22:00.704 --> 22:03.375
That's a good little girl.

22:49.092 --> 22:51.429
- "Looking for a...

22:51.429 --> 22:55.354
long-term relationship."

23:18.693 --> 23:20.446
It's perfect, right?

23:20.446 --> 23:22.784
It's like Rapunzel.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.943
You're paying the rent
on that place?

23:39.943 --> 23:42.239
If it were me,
he'd do the same thing.

23:42.239 --> 23:43.743
Medical bills?
How are you going to

23:43.743 --> 23:44.995
at that rate?

23:44.995 --> 23:46.247
I don't know,
we'll just figure it out.

23:46.247 --> 23:47.416
God, Mom,

23:47.416 --> 23:49.922
why can't you
just be happy for us?

23:49.922 --> 23:52.343
You know what,
I'm sick of this shit.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.854
- You wait.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.148
- Come on, Lacey...
- Wait, Mom--

23:59.148 --> 24:01.152
Don't leave like that.
Let's keep talking.

24:04.033 --> 24:05.912
Lacey, can I talk to you?

24:05.912 --> 24:08.250
- Sorry, Dee Dee, but now's
not really a good time.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.505
Real quick.

24:10.505 --> 24:12.592
I heard what you were
saying to Gypsy.

24:12.592 --> 24:15.431
She told me.
- What?

24:15.431 --> 24:16.600
You don't know
what you're doing,

24:16.600 --> 24:19.147
putting ideas into her head.

24:19.147 --> 24:20.692
I--I'm sorry, Dee Dee.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.155
I--I still don't know
what you're talking about.

24:23.155 --> 24:25.409
She doesn't know
anything about men.

24:25.409 --> 24:27.998
She doesn't even know
what sex is.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.173
I--I don't know
what Gypsy told you,

24:32.173 --> 24:34.051
but I--I wasn't talking
about sex.

24:34.051 --> 24:36.431
- She's got the mind
of a child.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.353
Everything to her
is rainbows and unicorns,

24:39.353 --> 24:42.819
and she thinks Rapunzel
is a real person.

24:42.819 --> 24:44.698
- I--I know Gypsy's not
like everyone else,

24:44.698 --> 24:45.950
and I would never
do anything--

24:45.950 --> 24:47.495
- You already did.

24:47.495 --> 24:48.998
- I did not.

24:48.998 --> 24:51.712
- I'll thank you
to stay away from--

24:53.841 --> 24:56.555
- Dee Dee!
Oh, my God, Mom!

24:56.555 --> 24:58.518
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I don't know.

24:58.518 --> 24:59.978
She just fell over.

24:59.978 --> 25:01.439
Mom?

25:01.439 --> 25:03.318
She'll be okay.
I think she fainted.

25:03.318 --> 25:04.445
Mom?

25:08.663 --> 25:10.625
- <i>Why now? Why'd you choose</i>
<i>me as the matchmaker?</i>

25:10.625 --> 25:12.169
<i>I'm still having</i>
<i>a hard time.</i>

25:12.169 --> 25:13.714
<i>I really need help</i>
<i>in finding a guy</i>

25:13.714 --> 25:16.344
<i>- that I can commit to.</i>
<i>- I want you to really...</i>

25:16.344 --> 25:18.599
- Is there anything else
I can get you?

25:20.310 --> 25:23.108
- Oh, watch a--
watch a movie with me.

25:24.277 --> 25:27.116
We could watch "Twilight."

25:27.116 --> 25:29.120
I know
it's your favorite movie,

25:29.120 --> 25:32.167
and I haven't
let you watch it for years.

25:32.167 --> 25:35.132
- Um, I'm kinda tired, Mom.

25:35.132 --> 25:37.469
Oh, please, please, please.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.808
Oh, it could be a treat.

25:39.808 --> 25:42.522
It could be a treat
for both of us.

25:45.235 --> 25:48.074
- I would love that.

25:49.995 --> 25:51.874
Okay.

25:51.874 --> 25:54.630
<i>You're so cold.</i>

25:56.132 --> 25:57.969
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>hurt you.</i>

25:57.969 --> 26:01.184
<i>I cannot live</i>
<i>without you.</i>

26:35.837 --> 26:37.882
Oh!

26:46.734 --> 26:48.988
Oh...

28:34.239 --> 28:36.536
<i>Yes, I've been</i>
<i>talking to the hospital</i>

28:36.536 --> 28:38.582
<i>about those</i>
<i>guardianship papers.</i>

28:38.582 --> 28:40.795
<i>Well, they said</i>
<i>you could draft something</i>

28:40.795 --> 28:43.299
<i>called a power of attorney?</i>

28:43.299 --> 28:45.888
- Yes, indeed I can.

28:45.888 --> 28:47.140
- Oh...

28:47.140 --> 28:49.186
Oh, great.

28:49.186 --> 28:52.317
- It's not the same thing
as a guardianship, though.

28:52.317 --> 28:54.154
Uh, Gypsy would need
to sign it.

28:54.154 --> 28:57.369
She has to consent
to a power of attorney.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.749
<i>It's like I told you</i>
<i>a few weeks ago,</i>

28:59.749 --> 29:02.087
<i>she gets to decide</i>
<i>these things herself.</i>

29:02.087 --> 29:03.966
- Well, that shouldn't be
a problem.

29:03.966 --> 29:07.264
The hospital said then
I don't need the guardianship.

29:07.264 --> 29:09.059
- Yeah, well,
that's only sort of true.

29:09.059 --> 29:10.688
A power of attorney

29:10.688 --> 29:12.482
only gives you power
over your daughter

29:12.482 --> 29:15.447
in the event that
she became incapacitated.

29:15.447 --> 29:17.284
<i>Mostly it means that just--</i>

29:17.284 --> 29:18.662
<i>people would come to you</i>

29:18.662 --> 29:20.624
<i>before they'd come</i>
<i>to any other family member.</i>

29:20.624 --> 29:22.837
- Oh, of course, of course.

29:22.837 --> 29:24.507
Well, you know,

29:24.507 --> 29:27.053
her father has nothing
to do with her.

29:27.053 --> 29:30.895
<i>It would be a disaster</i>
<i>if he ever got involved.</i>

29:30.895 --> 29:32.940
<i>Well, it would</i>
<i>effectively make you</i>

29:32.940 --> 29:35.320
<i>her caregiver</i>
<i>in the eyes of the law.</i>

29:35.320 --> 29:39.119
- Oh, give me such
peace of mind to have this.

29:39.119 --> 29:41.541
If you could just
draft it up for me?

29:42.835 --> 29:43.837
<i>Hello?</i>

29:43.837 --> 29:45.131
- Uh, sure-- sure thing.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.760
I'll, uh-- I'll call you
when it's ready.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.891
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:49.891 --> 29:51.770
- Hmm.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.259
Um...

30:07.259 --> 30:09.054
I'm really glad
that we're doing this.

30:09.054 --> 30:11.475
<i>Me, too.</i>

30:12.895 --> 30:15.358
I feel, um...

30:15.358 --> 30:17.780
I feel shy, though.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.701
- <i>Why?</i>

30:19.701 --> 30:22.790
<i>We talked all night...</i>

30:22.790 --> 30:24.501
<i>pretty much all week.</i>

30:24.501 --> 30:26.631
- I know, but...

30:26.631 --> 30:29.344
it's-- we haven't, like,
seen each other,

30:29.344 --> 30:31.390
you know, until right now.

30:31.390 --> 30:34.438
<i>Right.</i>

30:34.438 --> 30:37.402
<i>Um, can you</i>
<i>twirl around for me?</i>

30:37.402 --> 30:39.448
<i>I want to see you.</i>

30:39.448 --> 30:41.493
<i>I want to see your, um,</i>

30:41.493 --> 30:43.456
<i>your, um, your body.</i>

30:43.456 --> 30:45.168
<i>Not like in a-- a bad way.</i>

30:45.168 --> 30:47.965
<i>I just want to see, like,</i>
<i>the whole of you.</i>

30:49.969 --> 30:51.598
- <i>Right, um...</i>

30:52.600 --> 30:54.687
Oh, actually, I--

30:54.687 --> 30:58.277
well, I, um-- I can't.

30:58.277 --> 31:01.283
- <i>Why?</i>

31:01.283 --> 31:05.124
- <i>Um, I'm worried that</i>
<i>if I tell you, you won't...</i>

31:05.124 --> 31:08.005
<i>like me anymore.</i>

31:08.005 --> 31:11.136
- <i>I would like you</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

31:12.430 --> 31:14.727
- <i>Okay, well...</i>

31:14.727 --> 31:17.942
I guess I'm just nervous
to tell you, but...

31:17.942 --> 31:21.323
<i>um, I use a wheelchair.</i>

31:21.323 --> 31:24.037
- <i>Oh, okay.</i>

31:26.250 --> 31:27.419
<i>Can't really see it.</i>

31:27.419 --> 31:29.841
- Also, this isn't
really my hair.

31:29.841 --> 31:32.012
Right now I can't
actually grow hair

31:32.012 --> 31:35.393
because I am sick.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.650
I-- I have all these, uh--
these challenges.

31:41.113 --> 31:44.077
Do you... still like me?

31:46.541 --> 31:48.085
- <i>Of course I do.</i>

31:48.085 --> 31:49.881
- <i>Really?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

31:51.425 --> 31:54.557
<i>I actually have</i>
<i>some challenges of my own.</i>

31:54.557 --> 31:56.477
- Really?
What kind?

31:56.477 --> 31:58.314
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

31:58.314 --> 32:01.236
<i>It's like, when I was 14 or 15</i>

32:01.236 --> 32:03.909
<i>I saw a glimpse of something</i>
<i>in my eye.</i>

32:03.909 --> 32:05.244
<i>And I didn't know what it was,</i>

32:05.244 --> 32:08.334
<i>but it kept gnawing at me.</i>

32:12.467 --> 32:14.722
- Does it hurt?

32:14.722 --> 32:15.849
- <i>What?</i>

32:15.849 --> 32:17.060
- The thing
that's in your eye.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.272
Does it hurt?

32:19.272 --> 32:21.360
- <i>Oh...</i>

32:21.360 --> 32:22.822
<i>No.</i>

32:22.822 --> 32:24.909
<i>No, it's not like a splinter</i>
<i>or anything like that.</i>

32:24.909 --> 32:26.663
- Oh, okay.

32:26.663 --> 32:29.167
- <i>It's more like, um...</i>

32:29.167 --> 32:32.423
<i>it's more like</i>
<i>another personality.</i>

32:32.423 --> 32:34.929
<i>Actually...</i>

32:34.929 --> 32:37.726
<i>yeah, I think I do have,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

32:37.726 --> 32:40.189
<i>multiple personalities.</i>

32:42.987 --> 32:44.866
- <i>Oh.</i>

32:44.866 --> 32:46.451
- <i>But, um, don't worry,</i>

32:46.451 --> 32:49.332
<i>because there is a good one.</i>

32:49.332 --> 32:50.961
<i>It's me, Nick.</i>

32:50.961 --> 32:53.717
<i>But the other one is dark.</i>

32:53.717 --> 32:55.762
<i>Actually, he's a vampire.</i>

32:55.762 --> 32:58.727
<i>His name is Victor.</i>

33:03.820 --> 33:06.116
- Um...

33:06.116 --> 33:08.120
that's okay, I...

33:08.120 --> 33:10.751
I guess that I'm...

33:10.751 --> 33:13.715
<i>I guess that I'm a lot</i>
<i>of different people, too.</i>

33:46.363 --> 33:48.242
Hey, Dee Dee.

33:48.242 --> 33:51.248
- Are you all right?

33:51.248 --> 33:54.421
Oh...

33:54.421 --> 33:57.468
Oh, there.

34:00.308 --> 34:01.602
And we haven't talked

34:01.602 --> 34:04.024
since that day we had
the big fight.

34:04.024 --> 34:07.155
- Oh, my, I can't imagine that.

34:07.155 --> 34:09.618
Oh, here.

34:09.618 --> 34:11.706
I'm not gonna be the one
that calls first.

34:11.706 --> 34:13.877
I mean, she's gotta call me
after what she said.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.839
- Oh, I can't imagine
what I'd do with Gypsy

34:15.839 --> 34:18.636
if she spoke to me like that.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.438
- I was wild, you know?

34:24.438 --> 34:26.025
- Mm, well, I believe it.

34:27.654 --> 34:30.326
I hated my mom.

34:30.326 --> 34:33.206
She never said one word
about nothing I did.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.837
Was too wrapped up in herself.
- Well, that's awful.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.221
- I said I wasn't gonna
be like that, and I ain't been.

34:41.556 --> 34:43.018
Lacey hates me anyway, though.

34:43.018 --> 34:45.982
- Sometimes we have
to make them hate us.

34:45.982 --> 34:48.195
Sometimes it's the only way

34:48.195 --> 34:50.826
if we tell 'em the truth.

34:50.826 --> 34:53.665
- Wish there was
another way, though.

34:53.665 --> 34:55.668
- My mama used to say,

34:55.668 --> 34:58.090
"Sometimes the only way...

34:58.090 --> 35:00.344
out of the fire is through it."

35:00.344 --> 35:02.140
- What does that mean?

35:02.140 --> 35:05.939
- Oh, I used to think it meant
you have to be brave.

35:05.939 --> 35:09.028
But then I realized...

35:09.028 --> 35:11.784
she meant you have to suffer.

35:11.784 --> 35:13.997
You learn more from it.

35:16.794 --> 35:18.965
- I'm afraid, though.

35:18.965 --> 35:22.138
she's never gonna
come back here...

35:22.138 --> 35:23.516
and that she thinks
I'm the fire

35:23.516 --> 35:25.896
she's gotta walk through.
- Mm.

35:25.896 --> 35:28.192
- She doesn't understand
I'm trying to protect her.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.737
You ever feel that way?

35:29.737 --> 35:32.033
- Oh, of course.

35:32.033 --> 35:33.787
Of course, all the time.

35:33.787 --> 35:35.874
That's what being a mom is--

35:35.874 --> 35:38.253
never being sure
you're doing the right thing,

35:38.253 --> 35:40.216
but doing it anyway.

35:42.721 --> 35:44.642
- That's it, Dee.
- Mm.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.230
- That's exactly it.
- Okay.

36:04.305 --> 36:06.393
Oh...

36:15.369 --> 36:17.958
Oh, Gypsy?

36:17.958 --> 36:19.837
- Mom?
- Oh...

36:19.837 --> 36:21.757
oh, I don't feel good.

36:21.757 --> 36:25.515
Oh, I'm real sick.

36:25.515 --> 36:27.519
- Um, here, let me--

36:27.519 --> 36:29.857
do you want me to--
Do you need an ambulance?

36:29.857 --> 36:31.443
- No, no, no,
just stay with me.

36:31.443 --> 36:33.071
- Whoa, whoa!
Okay.

36:33.071 --> 36:34.992
- Oh, Gypsy.
- Um, let's lie down.

36:37.121 --> 36:39.627
- Okay.

36:41.505 --> 36:44.720
- Oh, it's like Sleeping Beauty
pricking her finger

36:44.720 --> 36:46.849
on the spinning wheel.

36:46.849 --> 36:48.811
- Um, is 72 low?

36:48.811 --> 36:51.441
Real low.

36:51.441 --> 36:52.736
But I'll be okay.

36:52.736 --> 36:55.449
Just stay with me.

37:00.961 --> 37:03.591
I been thinking
about what to do

37:03.591 --> 37:05.637
now that you're 18,

37:05.637 --> 37:08.893
of an age
to know certain things.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.522
- Like what?

37:10.522 --> 37:14.362
- Like lying and cheating
is wrong.

37:15.865 --> 37:18.538
And not just in the Bible.

37:18.538 --> 37:21.877
You can get arrested for it.

37:21.877 --> 37:24.394
- I know.
- I know you know.

37:24.394 --> 37:28.306
I know my family told you
that I went to jail.

37:32.064 --> 37:34.820
Going to jail
was the worst thing

37:34.820 --> 37:37.158
that ever happened to me.

37:39.370 --> 37:43.045
There are bad people
in there, Gypsy.

37:43.045 --> 37:45.508
Someone tried to stab me

37:45.508 --> 37:49.015
with a knife she made
out of razorblades.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.190
I don't ever want that
to happen to you.

37:53.190 --> 37:54.735
- No, I don't--

37:54.735 --> 37:56.781
I don't want that to happen
to me, either.

37:56.781 --> 37:58.075
Oh, good.

37:58.075 --> 38:00.997
'Cause I figured out a way...

38:00.997 --> 38:03.961
to keep us both safe.

38:05.590 --> 38:08.930
Here, I need you
to sign these papers.

38:13.313 --> 38:15.819
And everyone will know...

38:15.819 --> 38:19.200
everything's the same
between us.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.622
That you are still my child...

38:21.622 --> 38:24.377
in your mind.

38:26.297 --> 38:28.135
- But I'm old enough to--

38:28.135 --> 38:31.391
- You're old enough
to be blamed...

38:31.391 --> 38:36.109
for everything
we have ever stolen.

38:36.109 --> 38:39.448
Every lie we ever told.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.918
They're gonna blame you, Gypsy.

38:44.918 --> 38:48.801
That's what it is
to be an adult.

38:48.801 --> 38:51.974
You'll be responsible.

38:51.974 --> 38:55.397
I'm trying to protect you
from that.

38:55.397 --> 38:58.236
I just need you to sign this...

38:58.236 --> 39:01.075
so I can protect you.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.758
- Okay, Mama.

39:08.758 --> 39:10.553
Okay.

39:10.553 --> 39:13.643
- Oh...
- Okay.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.772
- Yeah.

39:25.541 --> 39:29.173
You're such a good girl.

39:29.173 --> 39:30.969
Oh...

39:30.969 --> 39:34.267
you're such a good girl to me.

39:44.245 --> 39:45.790
<i>I'm trapped.</i>

39:45.790 --> 39:47.418
- Yeah...

39:47.418 --> 39:49.338
<i>I can't get away.</i>

39:51.134 --> 39:54.098
<i>I can't tell anyone.</i>

39:58.356 --> 40:00.110
- <i>You can tell me.</i>

40:00.110 --> 40:02.741
- No, no, it's a secret, and--

40:02.741 --> 40:05.663
and even you might hate me
if I tell you.

40:05.663 --> 40:07.499
- <i>You can tell me</i>
<i>anything, Gypsy.</i>

40:07.499 --> 40:10.213
<i>No matter what it is,</i>
<i>I will always accept you.</i>

40:10.213 --> 40:13.554
Okay.

40:13.554 --> 40:17.186
I don't really need
a wheelchair.

40:19.816 --> 40:21.319
- <i>What?</i>

40:21.319 --> 40:24.701
- She makes me stay in it.

40:24.701 --> 40:29.293
And for a long time
I thought I needed it,

40:29.293 --> 40:32.132
and she says that
if I walk around...

40:32.132 --> 40:35.723
that I'll get sicker,
and I believed her.

40:35.723 --> 40:38.813
But I'm pretty sure
that she made it up.

40:38.813 --> 40:40.525
And I've been
going along with it,

40:40.525 --> 40:44.281
and we've fooled
a lot of people.

40:44.281 --> 40:46.202
And they're all gonna be
so mad

40:46.202 --> 40:49.626
if I ever,
ever tell them, so...

40:49.626 --> 40:51.505
I'm trapped.

40:51.505 --> 40:53.968
- <i>I-- I love you, Gypsy.</i>

40:53.968 --> 40:56.974
- <i>Oh, I love you, too.</i>

41:01.900 --> 41:04.447
- <i>Can I show you something?</i>

41:04.447 --> 41:05.741
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>- I think it's something</i>

41:05.741 --> 41:07.411
<i>that might make</i>
<i>you feel better</i>

41:07.411 --> 41:09.373
<i>about being trapped, I think.</i>

41:09.373 --> 41:12.087
<i>In what way?</i>

41:13.632 --> 41:16.930
- <i>Like, where I could be</i>
<i>your prince in real life.</i>

41:18.224 --> 41:19.853
<i>Or...</i>

41:19.853 --> 41:22.775
<i>you let me teach you</i>
<i>about something...</i>

41:22.775 --> 41:25.489
<i>that I really think</i>
<i>you might like.</i>

41:26.992 --> 41:29.079
- What is it?

41:46.657 --> 41:49.245
- <i>It's called "BDSM."</i>

43:11.033 --> 43:13.622
- Aah!
- Mom!

43:13.622 --> 43:15.250
- What were you doing?!

43:15.250 --> 43:18.339
What were you thinking?!

43:18.339 --> 43:20.678
What are you hiding from me?

43:21.805 --> 43:26.272
What do you have
to say for yourself?

43:26.272 --> 43:30.321
- I'll just get another one.

43:30.321 --> 43:33.202
- What?
- You heard me!

43:33.202 --> 43:36.668
I'll just get another one.

43:38.672 --> 43:40.300
- Mom, what are you doing?

43:40.300 --> 43:43.222
No, stop, stop, stop!

43:43.222 --> 43:45.519
Mom!

43:47.439 --> 43:49.778
Mom!

43:49.778 --> 43:51.531
What are you doing?

43:54.829 --> 43:56.708
Quiet!

43:56.708 --> 43:59.964
Quiet!
- Please--

43:59.964 --> 44:01.760
Stop it!

44:01.760 --> 44:04.849
Don't!

44:22.844 --> 44:24.806
Mom, are you-- Mom?

44:27.185 --> 44:28.856
Why?

44:43.635 --> 44:46.432
Gypsy!

44:46.432 --> 44:48.185
Don't leave me!
I can't--

44:48.185 --> 44:51.610
I can't make it without you!

44:52.987 --> 44:55.491
Gypsy, come back.

45:11.357 --> 45:14.656
Please. I'll never do it again.

45:14.656 --> 45:17.369
I'll never do it again!

45:17.369 --> 45:20.751
I promise!
I promise, baby!

45:22.253 --> 45:25.928
Don't leave me!
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

45:44.799 --> 45:48.724
I feel so much better already.

45:48.724 --> 45:50.978
- I am your angel.

45:52.982 --> 45:54.861
And I protect you,

45:54.861 --> 45:57.240
and you protect me, remember?

45:57.240 --> 45:59.369
- Oh...

45:59.369 --> 46:02.668
I love you.

46:02.668 --> 46:06.008
You're such a good girl.

46:46.338 --> 46:48.467
<i>Don't worry.</i>

46:48.467 --> 46:50.471
<i>I'm here.</i>

46:52.183 --> 46:55.231
<i>I will take care of you.</i>

46:55.231 --> 46:58.905
<i>Even when I'm not here,</i>
<i>I'm here.</i>

46:58.905 --> 47:02.078
<i>I will tell you exactly</i>
<i>what to do to feel safe.</i>

47:03.832 --> 47:06.378
- You will?

47:06.378 --> 47:08.215
- Lie on the bed.

47:11.639 --> 47:13.768
- Yes, sir.

47:19.530 --> 47:21.701
- First that hand.

47:27.253 --> 47:29.592
Now that one.

47:32.598 --> 47:34.977
Tighter.

47:34.977 --> 47:36.522
Tighter.

47:36.522 --> 47:38.777
- It's as tight
as it can go, sir.

47:38.777 --> 47:39.896
Are you sure?

47:39.896 --> 47:41.532
Because my dark side

47:41.532 --> 47:44.412
doesn't like
to be disappointed.

47:44.412 --> 47:46.626
- I'm sure.

47:50.174 --> 47:52.513
- Then I guess you're ready.
