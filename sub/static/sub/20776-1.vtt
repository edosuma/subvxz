00:26.777 --> 00:28.695
<i>Nobody knows</i>

00:29.780 --> 00:31.323
<i>when the world became this way.</i>

00:34.952 --> 00:37.955
<i>One day,
the contagion suddenly started</i>

00:39.331 --> 00:42.417
<i>and humans lost the power
to connect with the city.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:49.299
<i>After that,
the city expanded on its own,</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:51.593
<i>humans were seen as
illegal residents</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.680
<i>and were exterminated.</i>

01:00.310 --> 01:01.603
<i>It all happened</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:04.355
<i>long before I was born.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:00.203
Wait.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.981
This way.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.373
Be careful.

02:47.793 --> 02:48.960
Yeah. Sorry.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.804
You're too jumpy.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.305
They'll hear you.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.850
It's still okay around here.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.436
We might've just been lucky
up until now.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.022
- Don't let your guard down.
- But...

03:09.147 --> 03:10.399
Zuru's right, you know.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.364
I wonder if this is really the right path.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.909
It is a bit different from the map.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.247
It's an old map. The area must
have been rebuilt by the Builders.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.209
Do you really think we'll be okay
on our own?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.794
Let's go back.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.964
Why would we go back
when we've come this far?

03:35.257 --> 03:37.467
It should be just beyond this passage.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.678
I think.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.973
Zuru, up there.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.811
The exit.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.247
POTENTIAL LANDING
IMPACT WARNING

04:19.718 --> 04:20.761
Tae!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.603
Are you okay? Tae?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.481
Thanks, Fusata.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.529
Are you okay, Tae?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.407
I'm sorry, Zuru. The spare battery.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.284
We'll be in trouble when we get back.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.869
It's just one battery.

04:46.328 --> 04:50.081
Everyone'll be thrilled if we come back
with some sludge. Come on.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.626
Zuru.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.505
Zuru, what are you doing? Hurry.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.222
A Builder!

05:12.145 --> 05:13.063
Don't worry.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.441
They don't pay any
attention to humans.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.417
Okay, let's go. We're almost there.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.392
It's making more weird stuff.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.018
Let's go, Tae.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.443
Whoa, this is...

06:00.944 --> 06:03.405
I've never seen a place so big.

06:05.949 --> 06:06.908
WARNING

06:10.996 --> 06:11.913
A watchtower!

06:27.470 --> 06:30.432
That's why the grown-ups
told us not to come here.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.017
Well, that's it. Let's go home.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.227
Make sure the watchtower
doesn't see us.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.604
And how are we supposed to

06:35.729 --> 06:38.440
get to the hunting grounds
while avoiding that huge thing?

06:38.565 --> 06:39.733
Let's take another route.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.318
We'll go through here.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.321
It's a big detour.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.656
There's loads of obstacles in the way.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.950
Well, it can't be helped. Come on.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.092
If the Safeguard appeared
in a place like this...

07:06.551 --> 07:09.846
We've been trained as
Electra-Fishers, too, you know.

07:09.971 --> 07:14.851
Sutezo said that Zuru's already as skilled
as a fully-fledged Electra-Fisher.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.228
But we took this gear without permission.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.230
Pop is definitely gonna be angry.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.943
Zuru, I'm sorry.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.444
What? Tae?

07:25.028 --> 07:27.280
You said it was for my sister's sake,
right?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.950
For us to go out hunting alone like this.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.035
It's not just for Ito.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.331
After all, there's almost nothing
left to eat in the village.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.250
Thanks, Zuru.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.432
We did it.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.394
Look, over there.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.235
Look at all the bugs!

08:05.777 --> 08:07.028
It's the sludge pipes!

08:07.988 --> 08:08.905
Wait!

08:22.752 --> 08:23.795
It's no good.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.382
It's totally dried up.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.676
But it's such a thick pipe.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.597
Zuru.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.443
The watchtower?

09:02.876 --> 09:03.877
The Safeguard!

09:04.002 --> 09:05.086
Exterminators!

09:11.843 --> 09:12.969
Yaichi! Above you!

09:30.445 --> 09:31.362
Rama!

09:36.743 --> 09:37.660
Run!

09:58.223 --> 10:01.184
Everyone, stay calm!
Remember our training, lure them in

10:01.309 --> 10:02.185
then shoot!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.270
Did you hear that, Shizu?
Lure them to me!

10:04.395 --> 10:05.522
I can't get them off me!

10:07.732 --> 10:08.942
Shizu!

10:09.067 --> 10:10.110
Damn it!

10:11.653 --> 10:13.029
Shiro! Everyone!

10:16.825 --> 10:17.909
Tae!

10:31.923 --> 10:32.966
Tae!

10:45.395 --> 10:46.312
Zuru!

12:15.276 --> 12:16.194
More!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.161
Zuru!

12:34.087 --> 12:35.171
Are you okay?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.214
Zuru!

12:38.841 --> 12:40.301
Yeah, this is no...

12:45.306 --> 12:46.641
Wait, Fusata.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.077
It stopped.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.955
Take off your headgear.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.375
I want to see your eyes.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.630
- Hey.
- Zuru.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.305
Zuru!

13:25.430 --> 13:27.223
We're still in the watchtower's view!

13:47.952 --> 13:49.203
NET TERMINAL GENE
NON-CARRIER

13:49.329 --> 13:50.246
Why?

13:51.372 --> 13:54.792
The watchtower didn't react
even when she took her helmettal off?

14:01.591 --> 14:02.717
Hey! Tae!

14:05.762 --> 14:09.599
NET TERMINAL GENE
NON-CARRIER

14:12.643 --> 14:13.728
Are there

14:14.687 --> 14:19.567
any humans here
with the Net Terminal Gene?

14:21.319 --> 14:22.779
Net Termi...

14:24.322 --> 14:25.239
What?

14:28.910 --> 14:33.456
You saved us, so I wish we could
do something to help you in return.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.126
But we don't know what it is
you're talking about.

14:46.010 --> 14:50.014
Wait. One of the grown-ups
might know something.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.771
But before that, please, tell us.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.566
What are you?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.242
I'm Killy.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.497
A human.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.583
Our village is inside
the perimeter up ahead.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.256
We'll be fine once we get back there.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.509
Perimeter.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.599
That's the one place
the Safeguard can't enter.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.310
We don't know why, though.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.656
SIGNAL BLOCKED

16:35.161 --> 16:36.120
THREAT LEVEL - LOW

16:36.245 --> 16:38.331
See, that's the perimeter up ahead.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.673
Stop! Zuru, get away from him!

16:48.216 --> 16:49.967
Sutezo, wait!

16:51.093 --> 16:54.722
Why are you all showing your faces?
You'll be spotted by the watchtower!

16:55.306 --> 16:58.726
That's because
when we're with him, it's okay.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.186
Who is this guy?

17:00.311 --> 17:02.313
Mr Killy rescued us.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.773
He's human!

17:04.607 --> 17:05.483
Human?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.318
He can't be.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.987
Human, you say?

17:10.112 --> 17:11.906
Isn't he a Safeguard?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.242
I've heard there are Safeguards
that look just like humans.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.328
Right, Pop.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.001
Just three of you, huh?

17:25.627 --> 17:28.756
I'm sorry. The Exterminators...

17:29.257 --> 17:33.010
That's why we told you, Zuru,
you lot can't do it on your own!

17:33.135 --> 17:36.556
But then you went and took that gear
without our permission anyway.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.724
At any rate,
it's dangerous to stay out here.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.185
Get inside the perimeter, hurry.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.112
Pop!

17:56.826 --> 17:59.996
So, he's not a Safeguard.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.039
Yeah.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.919
Are you a traveller?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.213
Where did you come from?

18:09.338 --> 18:10.881
NET TERMINAL GENE
NON-CARRIER

18:12.466 --> 18:13.384
From

18:17.346 --> 18:18.264
levels below.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.518
6000?

18:23.477 --> 18:24.395
Impossible.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.647
We'll talk more inside.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.441
Come on.

18:29.984 --> 18:30.985
Pop!

18:53.424 --> 18:55.051
That's our village.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.888
At our peak, there were about
400 people living here.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.725
But now there are only about 150.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.061
If you're a traveller, we welcome you.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.230
That's our custom.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.694
Although you're a first
for our generation.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.239
The first person we've welcomed
into our village from the outside.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.747
We Electra-Fishers are descended
from people called Planters

19:24.872 --> 19:28.584
who apparently wandered
through the city like you.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.464
It's said that they found this place
about 300 years ago.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.928
So, we've lived inside the perimeter
ever since.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.643
So, it's rare for us
to meet any strangers.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.689
<i>In the city,</i>

19:49.814 --> 19:53.818
<i>there must be other humans
managing to survive.</i>

19:54.652 --> 19:58.072
<i>But we have no idea
how many there are,</i>

19:58.656 --> 20:00.408
<i>or where to find them.</i>

20:01.325 --> 20:02.827
<i>We don't know anything.</i>

20:05.830 --> 20:09.792
So, any stories we could hear
from a traveller would be precious.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.004
Pop, have you ever met a human?

20:14.672 --> 20:18.342
No. I've only found the remains

20:18.467 --> 20:20.094
of places where humans lived.

20:23.848 --> 20:24.765
Pop.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.936
Pop and the others are back!

20:29.061 --> 20:31.397
Hey! The kids are with him!

20:33.315 --> 20:36.402
Hey! The kids are back!

20:39.655 --> 20:40.865
What's that?

20:47.830 --> 20:50.958
Pop and Sutezo
brought the kids back!

20:51.083 --> 20:53.753
How many kids? All of them?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.504
I'm not exactly sure.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.591
And there's someone strange
with them.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.885
What do you mean, someone strange?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.803
Well...

21:03.971 --> 21:05.806
Welcome back, Pop.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.057
Pop.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.477
Just you guys?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.312
Where are the other three?

21:13.731 --> 21:17.026
And their gear? Did you leave that, too?

21:17.151 --> 21:20.988
What about the helmettals? Weren't you at
least able to bring the helmettals back?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.164
Damn.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.210
You know we don't have the tech
to make that stuff anymore.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.712
What about food?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.257
It was all dried up.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.428
It's enough that
three of them came back alive.

21:45.262 --> 21:49.225
Oh, well, in another month,
we'll all starve anyway.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.353
Pop.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.479
Who's that?

21:55.356 --> 21:56.315
He's a traveller.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.108
He's a traveller?

21:58.234 --> 22:01.111
So, there really are
other humans out there.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.488
Can we trust him?

22:02.613 --> 22:04.281
If he's a traveller, we'll welcome him.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.659
But we don't have
anything to feed him.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.577
He's not a Safeguard, is he?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.288
A Safeguard wouldn't be able
to get in here.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.999
Stay back.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.001
NET TERMINAL
GENE NON-CARRIER

22:16.126 --> 22:18.045
MALNOURISHED

22:22.091 --> 22:23.008
No!

22:45.531 --> 22:47.116
There's something drawn on it.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.327
A bucket of water?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.398
Not bad, actually.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.692
It must be really nutritious.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.860
Give me some.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.194
Save some for me.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.781
- This is great!
- This'll give you energy.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.452
Pop, Sutezo.

23:40.044 --> 23:40.961
Pop.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.844
Tae.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.262
Here.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.514
This much?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.183
There's some for your sister.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.186
Thank you.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.689
Zuru, Fusata.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.317
I'm glad you're back.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.778
But don't do anything
like that again, okay?

24:06.403 --> 24:07.404
I'm sorry.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.907
I'm sure you already know,

24:10.032 --> 24:12.242
but people looked
for a new hunting ground before

24:12.368 --> 24:14.328
and they were all killed
by the Safeguard.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.957
The group that went east
was completely wiped out.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.125
That's why this lot

24:20.751 --> 24:23.295
thought they had
to do something for the village.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.338
Zuru.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.842
When you've put the gear back,
come to my room.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.010
Okay.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.638
- Sutezo, let's go.
- Right.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.849
You come, too, please.
I'd like to speak with you.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.653
Your name was Killy, right?

24:48.946 --> 24:50.698
Thanks for sharing your food with us.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.159
Normally we'd be the ones
feeding you.

24:55.285 --> 24:59.206
But as you can see,
we're nearly out of food.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.458
Hey.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.585
Where did you get that thing?

25:05.337 --> 25:06.839
200 levels

25:07.423 --> 25:09.550
- below.
- 200?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.636
So, we can't go to get more.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.306
This place is protected
by the perimeter,

25:16.432 --> 25:18.684
but there's nowhere inside
where we can get food.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.855
So, we Electra-Fishers go out

25:23.439 --> 25:24.982
and get sludge to bring back.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.404
I'm the leader of the Electra-Fishers.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.284
But the hunting grounds near here
have all dried up

25:35.909 --> 25:37.411
and we have to go out farther.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.956
Each time, friends of ours are killed,

25:41.081 --> 25:43.000
leaving us with fewer and fewer Fishers.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.377
So, even the children...

25:47.254 --> 25:48.172
Here. Come in.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.096
That food is amazing.

25:57.181 --> 25:59.892
- I wonder where he got something like that.
- Yeah.

26:00.726 --> 26:04.646
And that weapon. To think it could
cut through even an Exterminator's body.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.527
6000 levels below.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.532
I wonder if he came all that way alone.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.409
Who knows.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.413
I wonder how many more
humans there are.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.875
Maybe there are other villages
like this one.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.252
There might be.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.713
I can't even imagine it.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.468
How far do you think
this city stretches?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.514
Why does the Safeguard
exterminate humans?

26:40.307 --> 26:43.310
I've never even thought about that.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.815
We really don't know anything.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.322
THREAT LEVEL

27:03.122 --> 27:08.085
So, according to Zuru, you took out
four Exterminators at once.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.548
It would really help to have
someone skilled like you around.

27:12.673 --> 27:16.176
Would you consider staying here
for a while to help us hunt?

27:18.053 --> 27:23.308
I'm looking for humans with

27:24.351 --> 27:25.602
the Net Terminal Gene.

27:27.604 --> 27:28.772
Net Termi...

27:29.731 --> 27:30.774
What's that?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.611
All humans had it

27:35.279 --> 27:38.574
before the contagion.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.743
Before the contagion.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.289
You're talking about a time
when the city belonged to humans.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.749
It's said the Builders

27:47.875 --> 27:50.878
and the Safeguard followed
the humans' orders back then.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.006
Such an ancient legend.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.924
What's that supposed to mean?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.802
The city belonging to humans.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.806
Are you saying that if we had
this Net Terminal Gene,

28:02.931 --> 28:05.434
we could stop the Safeguard?

28:05.559 --> 28:06.852
Not only that,

28:06.977 --> 28:08.937
we could give orders to the Builders

28:09.062 --> 28:11.565
and make them stop building
on their own.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.484
We could stop the expansion of the city.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.195
Wow.

28:17.613 --> 28:21.074
But there's no way
there's anything like that here.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.826
Well,

28:23.994 --> 28:26.246
I've actually heard of it before.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.917
That Net Terminal thing.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.296
I'd long since forgotten about it,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.674
but hearing him speak of it
reminded me.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.845
I know I've heard that phrase before,
a long time ago.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.680
But where?

28:44.765 --> 28:47.267
Right beneath this village.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.811
A place inside the perimeter,

28:49.937 --> 28:53.857
but we've been told for generations
not to go near it.

28:54.775 --> 28:58.278
You don't mean the Rotting Shrine?

29:00.155 --> 29:03.742
My Grandma always told me
never to go near it

29:03.867 --> 29:05.994
because there's a ghost there
scarier than the Safeguard.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.747
Sutezo. Do you really believe that?

29:13.293 --> 29:14.711
Hey, you!

29:16.004 --> 29:16.922
Right beneath

29:18.465 --> 29:19.383
the village.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.094
He's planning to go there.

29:23.053 --> 29:24.513
Sutezo, follow him.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.599
- Tell him to wait. I'll show him the way.
- Right.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.144
I'm going, too!

29:37.401 --> 29:38.318
Hurry.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.331
Grandma said

29:52.541 --> 29:54.751
that if you go near the Rotting Shrine,

29:54.876 --> 29:57.504
a stranger interrupts
your communications

29:57.629 --> 30:00.257
and their voice can control you
like a puppet.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.676
Stop telling these tales.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.640
My own great-grandad
fell to his death because of that,

30:09.766 --> 30:10.767
according to Grandma.

30:32.914 --> 30:33.832
Over there.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.760
- What's that?
- Look!

30:55.604 --> 30:56.605
Net

30:57.439 --> 30:58.732
terminal

30:58.857 --> 30:59.775
connection.

31:02.736 --> 31:03.653
L.-

31:04.321 --> 31:05.238
Cibo.

31:17.793 --> 31:18.710
Come out.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.468
Is someone there?

31:50.617 --> 31:52.035
I've waited for so long.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.495
It talked.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.875
I've been calling for help all this time,
but no one came.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.296
It was so long, until you came.

32:03.422 --> 32:07.592
I waited for 17 million
526 thousand hours.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.262
What's your name?

32:12.431 --> 32:13.432
Killy.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.559
I'm Cibo.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.269
I'm a scientist.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.271
Nice to meet you, Killy.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.191
So, a scientist

32:23.984 --> 32:25.986
really did survive.

32:27.696 --> 32:31.533
That's a Gravitational
Beam Emitter, right?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.661
Quite an impressive gun.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.999
That's the one technology
that even we couldn't re-create.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.751
Where did you find it?

32:44.629 --> 32:46.840
I don't know about the gun.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.011
NET TERMINAL GENE
NON-CARRIER

32:51.136 --> 32:54.055
There are vestiges of the contagion
in your irises.

32:55.307 --> 32:59.936
You don't have
the Net Terminal Gene.

33:01.354 --> 33:05.192
What sort of stupid thing is that to say?
Of course I don't.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.777
Do you know

33:08.528 --> 33:12.365
any humans who have
the Net Terminal Gene?

33:14.117 --> 33:16.244
If there were any humans like that,

33:16.369 --> 33:19.206
then this city would have been
made functional again ages ago.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.875
But I've got something good.

33:22.959 --> 33:26.755
Killy, take me to the automated factory.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.466
Automated factory?

33:29.591 --> 33:31.134
What's that?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.177
Who knows.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.222
If you take me to the automated factory,

33:35.347 --> 33:39.059
I'll make you a synthetic terminal
that has the same effect

33:39.184 --> 33:40.602
as the Net Terminal Gene.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.148
You don't believe me, do you?

33:46.316 --> 33:47.651
But it's true.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.737
That thing there.

33:51.571 --> 33:54.783
That's actually the wreckage
of a synthetic terminal that I made.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.036
There's a connection port beneath it.

33:59.829 --> 34:04.042
When we found a connection port
to the NetSphere here,

34:04.167 --> 34:08.088
we surrounded the area with an electric
barrier to keep the Safeguard

34:08.213 --> 34:10.047
from invading,
and started experiments.

34:10.172 --> 34:13.467
To keep the Safeguard from invading?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.137
The experiments were successful.

34:17.097 --> 34:19.516
We got all the way
to the entrance to the Authority.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.770
But then we were found
by their defence mechanisms,

34:24.563 --> 34:26.231
and you can see what happened.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.525
Did you communicate with the Authority?

34:30.527 --> 34:31.485
No, we couldn't.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.114
But we analysed information

34:35.239 --> 34:38.784
coming through the counter-current
and found a channel we can use to get in.

34:39.327 --> 34:42.330
So, given another chance,

34:42.455 --> 34:43.998
I can definitely succeed.

34:44.748 --> 34:45.917
I have no idea

34:46.835 --> 34:48.003
what she's talking about.

34:48.837 --> 34:49.754
Hey, you!

34:50.672 --> 34:51.590
Yes?

34:52.799 --> 34:53.800
Just now,

34:53.925 --> 34:57.429
you said you did something to keep
the Safeguard from invading, right?

34:58.221 --> 35:02.017
Does that mean
you set up this perimeter?

35:02.726 --> 35:03.643
That's right.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.815
- How exactly did you do a thing like that?
- Killy, move that rubble out of the way.

35:18.992 --> 35:22.954
That's an electric barrier generator
I made.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.252
Thanks to that, we ran our
connection experiments

35:29.377 --> 35:32.422
- without interruptions from the Safeguard.
- Connection?

35:33.048 --> 35:36.301
If you can do that,
you can give orders to the city?

35:36.801 --> 35:37.719
That's right.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.640
Long ago, all humans had
the Net Terminal Gene

35:41.765 --> 35:43.308
and they could all do it.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.935
I can't believe it.

35:46.603 --> 35:49.022
How could humans
do a thing like that?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.066
But it's true, they really could.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.862
We tried to re-create that ability
artificially using machines.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.365
To stop the city running wild.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.995
If we go to the automated factory
I can make another terminal.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.790
Come on, Killy.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.125
Your goal is the same as mine,
isn't it?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.962
You want to bring the city back
under human control, right?

36:16.758 --> 36:17.676
Yes.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.761
Then it's decided.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.429
Let's go now!

36:25.934 --> 36:27.143
Wait.

36:28.269 --> 36:31.064
Where is this
automated factory?

36:32.357 --> 36:34.401
In a section far east of here.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.945
About 15 blocks away.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.988
15 blocks?

36:39.989 --> 36:41.408
That'd take two or three days.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.452
Could we help as well?

36:45.370 --> 36:47.831
- Pop.
- Sutezo.

36:49.582 --> 36:53.962
What these people are trying to do
might end up saving our village.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.257
Did you really believe all of that?

36:58.675 --> 37:01.344
Either way, things are growing worse
in the village.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.513
It won't be long before
we make a decision

37:03.638 --> 37:08.268
to leave the perimeter
or stay inside and starve.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.439
So, don't you think it's worth
taking a chance?

37:12.564 --> 37:13.982
That may be so.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.943
But if we go east for 15 blocks,

37:17.902 --> 37:21.114
the batteries in our gear probably
won't even last long enough

37:21.948 --> 37:24.576
and we can't get that far
without being caught by the Safeguard.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.827
All the more reason.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.496
No matter how strong this man is,

37:28.621 --> 37:31.708
there's no guarantee that even he
could reach that far alone.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.127
But if we can help him, even a little...

37:34.961 --> 37:38.256
True. It might be better
to have more people with us.

37:38.381 --> 37:42.218
But we'll need to take food
along for the trip

37:42.761 --> 37:44.512
and there's already so little left.

37:45.221 --> 37:49.017
At the automated factory
we can make anything.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.604
If we get there
I'll make you anything you want.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.481
Anything?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.650
Yes, even food, anything you like.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.486
Really?

38:00.069 --> 38:00.987
Killy.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.867
To be honest,
we don't even understand

38:05.992 --> 38:07.535
half of what she's saying.

38:08.828 --> 38:09.746
But,

38:11.039 --> 38:14.501
we'd like to take a chance
with you, and her.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.858
- Hurry!
- Aren't there any more spare batteries?

38:38.983 --> 38:41.319
- Take as many spears as you can!
- We need one more person!

38:41.444 --> 38:44.531
- Leave some to defend the village.
- Do we have enough helmettals?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.574
Stop stalling, all of you.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.630
Hey, Zuru!

39:02.549 --> 39:04.467
We'll be fine as long as we're with Killy.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.972
Let's go. Follow me.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.140
Yes, sir.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.192
What is that?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.862
I heard they found it
at the Rotting Shrine.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.575
Is that thing really alive?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.826
Yes, I'm alive.

39:31.828 --> 39:34.873
Hey, Sutezo. Is it true?

39:34.998 --> 39:37.709
Will she really make us food
if we take her to this

39:37.834 --> 39:39.586
automated factory place?

39:40.336 --> 39:41.754
I told you, don't ask me.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.548
It's true.

39:44.090 --> 39:46.885
I can make thousands
of the portable rations

39:47.010 --> 39:48.636
like the kind Killy had.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.346
Thousands?

39:51.014 --> 39:52.891
How wonderful if that's true.

40:01.274 --> 40:03.818
Pop, is it really safe

40:03.943 --> 40:05.653
to believe what this thing says?

40:06.237 --> 40:10.116
If you have a problem with my decision
then go back now.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.829
I don't have a problem.

40:15.580 --> 40:16.664
Right?

40:16.789 --> 40:19.459
I never had a problem to begin with.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.085
Shut up and walk.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.636
Pair up and get in a circular formation.

40:30.219 --> 40:32.388
- Don't leave much space between you.
- Yes, sir.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.642
There was no need for you
to come along, Tae.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.188
My sister's doing better thanks
to the food that Killy gave us.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.023
I need to repay him.

40:43.066 --> 40:46.694
And also, wherever Zuru goes

40:46.819 --> 40:48.112
I go with her.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.240
Tae.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.994
Things must be desperate for you
to be bringing these children along.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.871
To be honest,

40:56.996 --> 41:00.249
there aren't many of us left
who can use the Electro-Fisher gear.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.605
A watchtower!

41:23.815 --> 41:24.774
Hey.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.159
Is that what's doing it?

42:01.269 --> 42:04.397
What is this place?

42:04.522 --> 42:05.481
Killy.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.861
You're not going to just leave me
somewhere on the way, are you?

42:46.272 --> 42:47.190
Killy.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.537
Killy's metabolism is different
from normal humans.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.790
He very rarely needs to eat.

43:04.624 --> 43:05.875
Really?

43:06.959 --> 43:08.252
Well, what about you?

43:11.172 --> 43:12.381
I'll pass.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.550
But I appreciate the thought.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.085
Were you scared?

43:54.841 --> 43:57.343
Yeah. But I'm fine.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.055
When those Safeguards come,

44:01.722 --> 44:04.517
the air around them stinks of ions.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.561
It's like a stinging sensation

44:07.311 --> 44:08.604
in your nose.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.524
Did you smell it?

44:12.150 --> 44:13.442
I was so frantic,

44:14.193 --> 44:15.736
I don't really remember.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.364
Actually, I think I kind Of did.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.827
Now that you mention it,
there was a weird smell.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.581
I see.

44:27.623 --> 44:30.710
That's the type of thing
you have to experience to understand.

44:32.837 --> 44:33.754
Yeah.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.840
Remember this.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.759
When Electro-Fishers camp,

44:38.885 --> 44:41.470
we always light a fire like this
and sleep beside it.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.474
It's the way we've always done it.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.019
Why?

44:49.187 --> 44:50.313
Because

44:50.771 --> 44:53.274
we're on edge all day
when we're out hunting.

44:53.900 --> 44:55.610
It's said that

44:55.735 --> 44:58.821
the sight of fire
is soothing to humans.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.365
I'm sure that's been true
since long ago.

45:01.490 --> 45:04.035
Since long before the city
came to this state.

45:04.785 --> 45:08.164
At the end of the day,
people would watch the fire

45:08.289 --> 45:10.416
to put themselves at ease.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.480
I've waited for so long.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.568
There were others with me before,

45:38.569 --> 45:40.029
but they all passed away.

45:42.198 --> 45:45.243
<i>No one knows how long
the city has been like this.</i>

45:46.160 --> 45:48.621
<i>One day the contagion
just suddenly started</i>

45:48.746 --> 45:51.666
<i>and humans lost the power
to connect with the city.</i>

45:53.960 --> 45:57.672
<i>After that, the city started to expand
at random</i>

45:58.130 --> 46:01.300
<i>and the Safeguard regarded humans
as illegal residents</i>

46:01.425 --> 46:02.843
<i>and began to exterminate us.</i>

46:06.472 --> 46:11.435
<i>I was the chief scientist of Kaito,
a district far away from here.</i>

46:13.271 --> 46:14.981
<i>In that district,</i>

46:15.106 --> 46:17.858
<i>we'd excavated some information
from the remains of the city</i>

46:17.984 --> 46:19.527
<i>and managed to use it</i>

46:19.652 --> 46:21.946
<i>to preserve human life.</i>

46:23.447 --> 46:27.952
<i>But we knew it couldn't last for long.</i>

46:31.205 --> 46:33.457
<i>My group of scientists</i>

46:33.582 --> 46:36.919
<i>found a way to simulate
the Nez' Terminal Gene.</i>

46:38.087 --> 46:40.006
<i>My colleagues and</i> /

46:40.131 --> 46:43.134
<i>set out in search of another place
with a connection port.</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:47.763
<i>And that's where we found it.</i>

46:52.727 --> 46:53.728
Along our journey,

46:54.687 --> 46:56.605
one, then another of us died.

46:58.482 --> 47:02.153
Even the ones who managed to reach
there, during the experiment they all...

47:08.451 --> 47:11.620
I'm sure Kaito is gone now, too.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.050
The automated factory is through here.

48:08.427 --> 48:09.345
Pop.

48:10.054 --> 48:11.013
Yeah.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.182
No one who's gone this way

48:13.682 --> 48:15.476
has ever come back.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.564
They must have been caught
by the defence net.

48:21.357 --> 48:23.317
But with me and Killy here,
you'll be okay.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.236
You heard her.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.030
Let's go.

48:28.572 --> 48:29.490
Yes, sir.

48:42.878 --> 48:44.964
This is the entrance
to the automated factory.

48:47.174 --> 48:50.761
There are still automated factories
like this here and there around the city.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.682
This is the closest one to your village.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.194
It opened!

49:14.827 --> 49:17.997
You were able to connect?

49:20.207 --> 49:24.128
You don't need to be able to connect
to the NetSphere for something like this.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.515
What are those?

49:43.105 --> 49:45.274
So, this is what they call a factory.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.113
What are these pool things?

49:52.364 --> 49:55.117
Killy, put me on that console.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.510
INITIATE

50:13.802 --> 50:14.720
Look!

50:36.825 --> 50:37.868
Yes!

50:40.454 --> 50:41.830
WOW!

50:41.956 --> 50:44.166
Now we'll never have to worry
about food again!

50:44.291 --> 50:45.209
Yeah!

50:50.422 --> 50:52.550
Zuru, look! It's amazing.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.385
Yeah.

50:59.223 --> 51:01.642
STAND BY

51:11.443 --> 51:12.903
Killy, can you hear me?

51:16.824 --> 51:18.075
I'm having a little trouble.

51:19.326 --> 51:22.997
Take that synthetic terminal
and get ready to escape.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.959
I still can't move.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.305
Be careful.

51:39.430 --> 51:43.809
I went in quite deep. Last time
this happened, things went very badly.

51:46.020 --> 51:49.023
Is that one of those synthetic terminals
you told us about, Cibo?

51:51.358 --> 51:55.195
With that, we can stop the city, right?

52:06.373 --> 52:08.042
Hey, you.

52:31.732 --> 52:32.983
Pop!

52:34.318 --> 52:36.654
Retreat in two groups.
The cargo team goes first.

52:36.779 --> 52:39.031
Fighters, draw them in
and take them out.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.992
Yes, sir. Cargo team, hurry!

52:45.954 --> 52:46.872
Tae!

52:48.040 --> 52:49.124
Hurry!

52:56.590 --> 52:58.258
Exterminators! So many.

52:59.677 --> 53:00.886
Tae!

53:01.011 --> 53:02.471
Forget your pack, just come!

53:02.971 --> 53:03.889
But...

53:06.684 --> 53:08.560
- Tae!
- Zuru!

53:08.686 --> 53:09.603
Hurry!

53:25.911 --> 53:27.079
Here they come.

53:30.999 --> 53:32.251
Lure them in first.

53:34.002 --> 53:34.920
Right.

53:52.146 --> 53:53.147
Cibo!

54:00.571 --> 54:01.488
Rama!

54:35.731 --> 54:37.399
Incredible.

54:39.401 --> 54:40.486
We're going!

54:50.370 --> 54:51.330
Hurry!

54:54.333 --> 54:58.629
Tae! Can you hear me? Tae!
Tae! Where are you?

55:05.636 --> 55:06.678
Damn it!

55:12.142 --> 55:14.561
- Atsuji! Are you okay?
- My leg.

55:14.686 --> 55:15.813
Where's Tae?

55:18.232 --> 55:19.316
Where?

55:20.400 --> 55:24.029
Up there.
She was crushed by an Exterminator.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.072
Zuru!

55:25.823 --> 55:26.949
Zuru! No!

55:27.533 --> 55:29.159
Zuru! Zuru!

55:37.376 --> 55:39.419
Tae!Tae!

55:43.799 --> 55:44.716
Tae.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.468
Thank goodness.

55:49.513 --> 55:50.430
Zuru.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.642
I'm sorry, I'm okay now.

56:01.441 --> 56:03.360
Tae, are you okay?

56:04.820 --> 56:05.779
Yeah.

56:10.033 --> 56:10.993
Tae!

56:11.702 --> 56:12.619
Thank goodness.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.874
You're so reckless.

56:18.166 --> 56:19.084
Sorry.

56:38.186 --> 56:40.105
Are you all okay? You're not hurt?

56:40.230 --> 56:41.815
Tae's arm is broken.

56:43.150 --> 56:44.943
Tae, can you move?

56:47.154 --> 56:49.323
- All right, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

56:49.448 --> 56:50.824
Where's Cibo?

56:50.949 --> 56:52.826
She was crushed.

56:59.333 --> 57:00.334
Safeguard!

57:01.501 --> 57:03.378
They're still crawling around.

57:06.798 --> 57:08.175
They keep coming!

57:08.884 --> 57:11.637
Hey, you!
Fire that weapon from before!

57:14.389 --> 57:16.016
What's wrong with you?

57:16.141 --> 57:17.601
Why don't you shoot?

57:26.693 --> 57:27.861
Sorry I'm late.

57:29.196 --> 57:31.156
I've come to rescue you, Killy.

57:37.704 --> 57:38.914
Who?

57:39.414 --> 57:40.415
Cibo?

57:41.375 --> 57:44.002
That barrier coating
only lasts 30 seconds.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.046
Run.

57:50.384 --> 57:51.301
Run.

57:55.555 --> 57:56.515
Hurry!

57:57.516 --> 57:58.892
I'm done for.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.477
You go on.

58:00.602 --> 58:03.814
What are you saying, Atsuji? Run!

58:11.029 --> 58:12.155
Get in this carriage.

58:13.448 --> 58:14.408
Hurry!

58:22.124 --> 58:23.792
It's not broken?

58:24.459 --> 58:26.253
I'm making it work now.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.887
- Can't we go yet?
- Just a moment.

58:37.389 --> 58:38.390
There it is.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.065
Here we go.

58:47.566 --> 58:48.525
It moved!

58:48.650 --> 58:49.651
All right.

58:55.741 --> 58:57.117
I'm out of spears.

58:57.576 --> 58:58.869
I've got two left.

58:58.994 --> 59:00.787
I have one more.

59:00.912 --> 59:02.205
I have two.

59:02.330 --> 59:03.665
Don't give up!

59:05.125 --> 59:08.837
Killy, we'd finally gotten
the synthetic terminal and everything.

59:09.504 --> 59:10.714
It's a shame.

59:16.553 --> 59:18.388
INTERIOR POWER
GENERATION ACCELERANT

59:24.853 --> 59:26.938
DANGER

59:55.884 --> 59:56.802
Killy.

59:58.011 --> 59:58.929
Killy!

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.362
Why is he so heavy?

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:24.079
POWER SETTING
- ENERGY SAVING MODE

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.000
- We're almost at the village.
- Yeah.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.544
Does it hurt?

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.838
I'm fine.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.426
Tae.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:45.976
They're back! Pop and the others!

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:52.190
Hey, bring out the crane.
Time to unload!

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.788
Welcome back.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.582
Welcome back, Pop.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.834
- How did it go?
- Did you find the food?

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.336
Hey, take that down below.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:14.796
Yes, Pop.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.592
Don't worry, I'll take her.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:20.969
- Okay.
- They're injured.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.429
Get the molecular tape!

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:26.099
She's an awfully big girl.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:29.686
Is that the person
who looked like a corpse before?

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.274
Is he dead?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.901
I don't know.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.528
Bring it around slowly.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.988
It's pretty heavy.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:50.999
That's some strength she has.

01:01:57.505 --> 01:02:00.133
Killy's fine. He's just sleeping.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.387
Take him inside.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:05.472
Right.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:30.914
With all this, we should be fine
for four to five months.

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:33.833
So, it was worth gathering
all the equipment.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:36.127
We can finally eat till we're full!

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.922
How many died altogether?

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.508
So, two more good workers died.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.385
Finally!

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.429
Real food and drink at last!

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.314
Bring down the lights.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.905
A moment of silence

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.532
for everyone we've lost

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.159
over the last two years.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:30.932
Pop.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:32.642
Thanks.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.686
Give me another one, too.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.563
You're drinking too much.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.648
Because I want to.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.989
We finally get to mourn properly.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.407
Yeah.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.994
For a while we couldn't even
afford to do that.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:55.415
But now we've got food,
the village is saved.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.918
But at a high cost.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:02.881
We lost a lot of skilled
Electro-Fishers

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.133
and gear as well.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:09.679
Can't we just go back to that
automated factory place?

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.806
You can make anything there, right?

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:12.849
No.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.435
No, we can't go back there again.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.229
It's crawling with Exterminators.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:20.565
I see.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:25.528
So, we have to see how long
this food lasts.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:41.086
Killy.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:51.096
They say the village is saved.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.223
Everyone's really happy.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.645
If Cibo's experiment is successful,

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.022
will you still

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.566
continue your journey, Killy?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.207
Killy.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.210
Do you think maybe

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:24.963
you could stay?

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.717
Cibo.

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:37.058
Killy.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:44.315
POWER SETTING

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.197
The synthetic terminal.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:57.036
I'm going to connect it now.
There's something I'd like your help with.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:04.794
Wait.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.514
What are we gonna do now, Pop?

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:23.563
Now we just pray
that Cibo's experiment works.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:28.860
If it does, we won't have to live in fear
of the Safeguard anymore.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:33.323
I really can't wrap my head around it.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.617
Around what?

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:38.786
The idea of humans
connecting to machines.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.958
I mean, it's like...

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:51.090
They say the Builders and the Safeguard
will do what the humans say.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.551
That's a good thing, right?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:04.604
But why did people
want to do that in the first place?

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.151
I don't want to live long enough
to find out.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.244
You really eat a lot.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.538
Well, you earned it.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:24.624
No, it's not for me.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.335
I thought I'd take some to Tae.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:56.906
Zuru.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:40.158
I won't be able to move
while I'm connected.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:47.290
I want you to protect me then.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.069
Oh, Sutezo.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:20.948
Zuru, looks like he woke up.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.078
You were with Killy, right, Zuru?

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:33.502
Did you talk With him?

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.505
No.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.131
Hey.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.594
Zuru!

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:50.435
Oh, Pop.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.354
You're here to help?

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.857
I had a bit too much to drink.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:58.027
I'll take this on the way back
to my room.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.119
Zuru.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.746
Wait, Zuru.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.172
How'd it go? I bet you made her happy.

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:20.633
She's not in her room.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:32.979
Tae?

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:36.524
Tae?

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.317
- What is it?
- Tae!

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.637
It looks like the barrier generator
has been destroyed.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:17.315
Tae!

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:19.358
What's wrong with you?

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.068
Tae.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.904
Wait! Don't go near!

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:24.197
Tae.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.073
- Tae.
- Hey!

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.330
Tae.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.004
Pop!

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:46.886

Representative construct
of the Safeguard.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.738
We, the Safeguard, will eliminate

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:52.285
all illegal residents lacking
the Net Terminal Gene.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.829
- Tae! What's wrong with you?
- Fusata!

01:12:56.247 --> 01:12:57.582
The Safeguard?

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.667

Fusata!

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.685
Zuru, don't!

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.734
- What's going on?
- An explosion!

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.776
What's happening?

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.278
What happened?

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.333
ILLEGAL RESIDENTS

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:43.461
What is going on?

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:59.060
Successful infiltration of illegal
residents' unauthorised compound.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.978
Barrier generator destroyed.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:04.106
Total extermination in progress.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.525
Successful infiltration
of illegal residents'...

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:09.695
That's...

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:13.699
Posing as a human
to get through the barrier.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.202

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:20.498
It looks like we should hurry.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.873
Fusata, this way!

beginning auxiliary elimination.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.194
Damn! Our village.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.864
Pop!

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.325
Don't worry about me.
Go on ahead.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:20.367
Pop.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.913
Listen, Sutezo.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.499
Gather everyone together
and go up the tower.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:28.459
Shoot back from the top of the tower.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:32.963
Right.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:35.841
- Take care of Pop.
- I will.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.012
Hurry UP!

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.180
I'm going first!

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:42.848
You guys, WW UP!

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.229
Fusata! Put on your gear!

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.857
There aren't any more helmettals!

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:53.484
We don't have enough!

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.740
Zuru, here.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:03.744
But...

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.372
Sutezo.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.886
- Over there, don't let them in!
- Damn, they just keep coming!

What's going on?

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:10.454
Zuru?

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.165
Where did Tae go?

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:21.924
She was replaced by the Safeguard.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.718
There's no chance she's still alive.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.348

Tae can't be dead!

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:47.199
Zuru.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.151
How's that?

01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:28.365
Damn!

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.243
I'll blast you from up close!

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:03.025
Damn! What kind of monsters are they?

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:40.789
Hurry, up here!
Everyone, get up here quickly!

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:41.874

You are a body that was
stolen from us, the Safeguard.

01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:56.198
A body.

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:58.659
Do you intend to return?

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.744
Answer immediately.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.463
In accordance with the Ordinance,

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:14.007
I will destroy you here.

RELEASE DANGER

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.473
Aim carefully! Lure them in and shoot!

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:02.027
We did it! That was the last one!

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:14.164
Tae.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.281
It can't be.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.492
The Authority!

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.958
This must be inside the NetSphere, then.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:04.464
This is one of the reserve
electronic worlds that connects

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:06.633
the NetSphere to base reality.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:08.343
Reserve?

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:12.556
Please, let me connect
to the NetSphere.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:16.059
The net terminal you used

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.853
has just now lost its effectiveness.

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:18.937
No.

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:21.815
The connection to your brain
in base reality

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.402
will also be cut
in just a few nanoseconds.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:28.488
But you still have time.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:31.575
Here in the reserve world,
time is sped up.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.995
So, from your relative point of view,
time seems extended.

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:41.918
Please, at least stop
the Safeguard's attack on that village.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:46.673
Without an order from someone
with the Net Terminal Gene,

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:50.510
we, the Authority,
cannot take any such action.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:52.929
You're right.

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:56.892
However, as much as is allowed
within this reserve electronic world,

01:29:57.017 --> 01:29:59.895
I can tell you the coordinates
of abandoned levels

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.188
that the Safeguard
are not currently monitoring.

01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:09.738
What's this?

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:13.867
It stores a map of the levels near here.

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:18.705
We cannot take this information
out into base reality,

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.627
but we do not have any orders
to stop you from connecting to it.

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.451
Take the injured over there!

01:30:56.576 --> 01:30:57.953
Someone help carry them!

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.421
Hurry, over here.

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:10.131
Bring the molecular tape!

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.510
Fusata.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.266
Shall I wrap it?

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:24.145
Yeah.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.277
Killy.

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.200
We were saved thanks to you.

01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:41.454
Zuru, what happened to Cibo?

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:43.999
I don't know.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:46.418
I see.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.671
It's all over.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:51.965
It's too early to give up.

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:56.219
Wait!

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.810
NET TERMINAL GENE
NON-CARRIER

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:07.397
Cibo.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:12.360
Cibo!

01:32:14.279 --> 01:32:16.281
My brain is in my arm.

01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:21.036
This place has been found out
by the Safeguard.

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:23.371
Sooner or later,
the Exterminators will be back.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:25.248
Then what should we do?

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:29.627
There's an abandoned level
between this one

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:31.463
and the one below it.

01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:35.341
There's a descending track to it

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.219
to the north of here.

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:42.390
An abandoned level.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:46.936
It's a place that's been disconnected
from the NetSphere.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.148
The Safeguards and Builders
won't interfere.

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:51.858
What should we do?

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:53.485
Can we believe her?

01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:57.280
If we stay here we'll just be killed
by Exterminators.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:32:58.907
Pop.

01:33:05.705 --> 01:33:08.666
Everyone, get ready to leave.

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:19.427
Let's go, Killy.

01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:32.816
Killy.

01:33:44.661 --> 01:33:47.413
Come on, let's go home.

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:49.541
It's scary out here.

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:51.668
We're not going back there again.

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.087
The Safeguard found us there.

01:33:56.965 --> 01:33:59.134
Pop, I'm sorry.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:02.887
I...

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.932
It's my fault for
taking everyone out hunting.

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:07.350
No.

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:12.355
We should be thanking you.

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:42.343
Wow, Cibo,
you can call the railway carriage!

01:34:43.052 --> 01:34:44.929
Just don't try it yourself.

01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.105
MOVEMENT DETECTED
- ILLEGAL INHABITANT

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.106
CONNECTED TO AUTHORITY

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.900
Okay, everyone get in.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:01.196
Can we really get
to an abandoned level?

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:03.781
- Here, get in.
- Okay.

01:35:03.907 --> 01:35:04.908
Be careful.

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:10.038
That smell.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.170
- They're here!
- Hurry, everyone!

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:21.925
Killy, what are you doing?
Hurry and get in!

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:23.051
Killy!

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.183
You can't be serious.

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:34.020
What's wrong, Killy?

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:03.424
Killy.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.010
Won't I see you again?

01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:15.687
I'm looking for

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:17.647
the Net Terminal Gene.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:29.367
I'm closing it now.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:09.490
<i>That was the last
the villagers ever saw of him.</i>

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:19.500
<i>After that, my grandmother Zuru
led us all in the new land.</i>

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:22.337
Look how you've grown.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:24.922
<i>My grandmother</i>

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:28.384
<i>always talked to me about Killy
when I was young.</i>

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.020
<i>A long time has passed,</i>

01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:46.527
<i>but there's no sign of the city functions
returning to normal.</i>

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:55.036
<i>I suppose no one has been found yet
with the Net Terminal Gene.</i>

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.835
<i>But I believe.</i>

01:38:09.008 --> 01:38:10.218
<i>I know that somewhere,</i>

01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:12.553
<i>he's still out there
in that endless city,</i>

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:16.391
<i>continuing his search.</i>
