- [evil laugh]
- batter up! H'ya!

21:59.184 --> 22:01.118
- [screams]

22:01.120 --> 22:04.121
- H'ya!

22:04.123 --> 22:08.258
- [battle cry]

22:10.728 --> 22:11.394
Ah!

22:11.396 --> 22:13.063
All: Huh?
- Oh!

22:13.065 --> 22:14.097
Oh!

22:14.099 --> 22:17.968
- Yeah, and go back
from whence ye came!

22:19.770 --> 22:20.837
[loud pop]

22:20.839 --> 22:24.007
- Hi, mr. Krabs--
- never hold a seance, boy-o,

22:24.009 --> 22:25.509
Without me permission,

22:25.511 --> 22:27.811
Because ghosts
are like relatives,

22:27.813 --> 22:32.582
Once you let 'em in,
they'll never leave.

22:34.585 --> 22:38.455
- Order up.
Here's your "number nine," sir.

22:40.825 --> 22:42.959
And everything was better.

22:42.961 --> 22:45.896
- [eerie moan]
- what's that?

22:45.898 --> 22:49.866
- [moaning]

22:50.305 --> 22:56.384
