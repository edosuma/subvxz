All right,come on.Come on.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.820
Keep coming.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.150
Keep coming.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.130
Come on.

01:11.390 --> 01:14.270
Plenty of room.Plenty of room.Let's go.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.240
Come on.Come on.Come on

01:16.570 --> 01:17.740
Come on.Come on.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.640
Plenty of room.Plenty of room.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.770
That's good.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.600
Chief,are you sureyou've recovered
enough from your surgeryto be doing this?

01:34.850 --> 01:37.190
I have a note from my doctor,sergeant.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.760
You can read itif you'd like.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.720
Thank you.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.410
Morning,everybody.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.660
Where's our victim?

01:56.860 --> 02:02.780
A traffic-chopper pilot spotted the
car at 6:00 this morning,dialed 911.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.560
Fire and rescue repelled down
the hill,found a body --

02:05.570 --> 02:10.070
female,early 40s,declared dead on
the scene -- called the patrol car.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.000
Most of our vic is over there.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.260
Most of her?

02:13.270 --> 02:16.110
Yeah,coyotes came by the
bodyduring the night,chief.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.650
Yuck.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.860
So,it's a traffic accident.And
we're here because?

02:20.870 --> 02:22.590
The victim's I.D. Was found in the car.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.220
Her nameis marguerite scott.

02:24.230 --> 02:27.020
She worked with thedepartment
of homeland security.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.500
Our fire-and-rescueguys
brought this up.

02:30.510 --> 02:31.710
The car was a rental.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.360
The victim picked it
upfive days ago at lax.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.240
Paid extra for a hybrid.

02:37.250 --> 02:42.150
Our accident investigators saw no
signs of a collision,no skid marks.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.030
It seems like she
accelerated right off the cliff.

02:45.820 --> 02:46.690
If she's from D.C.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.440
She might have been
lost,didn't see the turn.

02:49.450 --> 02:51.310
Or she did it on purpose.

02:51.770 --> 02:56.920
A woman so concerned about the planet
that she rents a hybrid to kill herself in?

02:56.930 --> 02:59.640
Maybe she saw a tree down
there she wanted to hug.

03:04.940 --> 03:08.390
Detective daniels,could you please get in
touch with someone from homeland security?

03:08.400 --> 03:11.070
Ask them what ms.Scott might
have been doing here.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.070
Yes,ma'am.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.160
Thank you.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.630
Pardon me,sir.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.150
I'm deputy chief brenda
johnson of the lapd,

03:17.160 --> 03:21.660
and,um,I need to examine the
scene of the accident,

03:21.670 --> 03:23.470
but I'm just recoveringfrom
abdominal surgery,

03:23.480 --> 03:27.830
so I was wondering if you
could,pretty please,give me a lift.

03:28.230 --> 03:29.690
Let's go.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.620
Um,chief,you are
not physically ready for this.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.970
I need to see the body.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.670
We don't have training on
those harnesses.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.200
We're not supposed to use them.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.030
You're not doing it,sergeant.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.920
Take the rest of the crew and
climb down,and I'll meet you there.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.090
Ready whenever you are.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.350
Now,wait,wait,wait!

03:44.360 --> 03:46.970
I have a duty!Okay,wait!

03:46.980 --> 03:49.120
Damn it,chief!

03:56.970 --> 03:58.570
Let's go.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.990
Watch your step,guys.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.050
You're not coming?

04:04.060 --> 04:05.770
I don't hike.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.200
hard to tell which injuries are from
the crash and which are from the coyotes.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.350
Brenda: Looks like they
didn't touch her face.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.089
Thank you.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.430
Let's take a look at the car.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.110
We didn't find a handbag or cellphone.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.060
Detective sanchezis still doing a
search of the perimeter of the crash site.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.770
Now,she was from out of town,chief,

04:32.780 --> 04:36.980
so she may have been using the gps
system that comes with the car.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.710
Assuming the motherboard's 
still intact,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.910
we can see what
addresses she was punching in.

04:47.940 --> 04:50.190
I see a valet ticket down there.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.910
Uh,let's check her hotel room,

04:52.920 --> 04:55.520
drag her room phone,and
try and find her cell.

04:55.530 --> 04:57.940
See who she was talking to.

04:57.950 --> 05:01.230
Lieutenant flynn,if you could
grab that valet ticket,please.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.710
Uh,lieutenant tao,as soon as
buzz has what he needs here,

05:04.720 --> 05:07.050
please have this car towed
to the print shed.

05:07.060 --> 05:11.010
And,d,sergeant gabriel,see if you
can take the body to the morgue,please.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.630
See if we can determinethe
exact cause of death.

05:14.670 --> 05:15.630
um...chief

05:15.640 --> 05:17.310
Detective sanchez,you find anything?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.950
I found a toe,chief.
I bagged it.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.650
chief...listen...

05:19.660 --> 05:22.630
Hand it off to sergeant gabriel 
here and have him take 
it to the morgue.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.490
Chief,listen.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.090
Yes,buzz,what is it?

05:25.100 --> 05:27.910
You're standing in poison oak.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.290
Hey.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.280
Are you okay?

05:46.290 --> 05:48.170
Perfect. Perfect.

05:48.180 --> 05:51.920
I just need to,uh,take these
painkillers that the doctor gave me,

05:51.930 --> 05:54.010
but I cannot seem to find them.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.260
So,was maggie scott's
deathan accident or what?

05:57.270 --> 05:58.320
Oh,we don't know yet.

05:58.330 --> 06:01.710
She is a departmentof
homeland security employee,

06:01.720 --> 06:04.590
and detective daniels saysthat
she was here on business,

06:04.600 --> 06:08.050
but they won't tell us
why or what she was doing.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.180
She was an accountant,and
she was auditing us.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.380
You called her maggie.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.110
Yeah,she was a friend.

06:18.890 --> 06:21.200
Listen,I'd appreciate it if you,uh,

06:21.210 --> 06:23.980
kept me very closely
advised about what happened to her.

06:23.990 --> 06:25.940
S-sure.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.210
And no worries about
overtimeon this one.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.540
I'll,uh --I'll
cover it somehow.

06:31.550 --> 06:32.850
Okay.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.690
- Thank you.
- Sure.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.260
Impossible.

06:44.270 --> 06:48.250
Homeland security gave us a 
grant for the new communication 
equipment..

06:48.260 --> 06:50.820
so police could
communicate during a crisis.

06:50.830 --> 06:55.390
Maggie -- Marguerite
-- Scott was sent by dhs

06:55.400 --> 06:58.180
to keep tabs on how we
were spending their money.

06:58.190 --> 07:02.950
Part of lapd's financial troubles
-- for every dollar the feds give us,

07:02.960 --> 07:06.280
we spend two dollars trying
to prove we're not wasting it.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.810
Well,there's your motive,chief.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.310
Everybody hates an auditor.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.510
Maggie's husband is on his way to L.A.

07:12.520 --> 07:17.350
But our friends at dhs were more 
eager to talk about Maggie's
missing cellphone and laptop,

07:17.360 --> 07:20.400
both of which are encrypted and
contain classified information.

07:20.410 --> 07:22.620
Which is why I can't get a phone bi.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.290
What have we foundin
maggie's hotel room?

07:25.300 --> 07:26.740
No sign of forced entry.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.010
And although she never used
the phone in her room,

07:29.020 --> 07:30.810
we couldn't find a cell phone anywhere.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.000
We did,however,find a laptop charger.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.180
We pulled the navigation
system out of maggie's car,chief.

07:38.190 --> 07:43.230
The screen is shot,d to her gps.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.860
The first one is from her hotel,

07:45.870 --> 07:49.400
and the second is 150
north los angeles street.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.940
She was in our
building --this week.

07:51.950 --> 07:56.080
Most likely to see jim
hanson in fiscal operations.

07:56.090 --> 07:58.570
Then there's the italian
restaurant downtown.We called.

07:58.580 --> 08:01.470
She dined there, two
nights ago -- alone.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.870
The next addressis a business
in north hollywood --civil audio.

08:04.880 --> 08:09.290
Which supplied the radios we
purchased with the dhs grant money.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.830
This last address is
interesting --

08:10.840 --> 08:14.920
elysian park drive,precisely where
maggie scott's car went off the cliff,

08:14.930 --> 08:18.180
and it's only five blocks from
lapd's academy road.

08:18.190 --> 08:21.490
Yeah,but why would she want to
know how to get to that exact spot?

08:21.500 --> 08:23.340
There wasn't even a house there.

08:23.350 --> 08:27.000
Maybe she had a boyfriend that
no one knew about.

08:27.010 --> 08:30.250
I mean,a lot of couples go
up there to,you know...

08:31.150 --> 08:32.650
check out the view.

08:32.659 --> 08:36.429
Well,she was a little long in the
tooth to be necking in her car.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.860
Priority Homicide, Provenza..

08:38.870 --> 08:43.990
Hey,look,she's a federal employee working
for homeland security,and she's married.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.910
Maybe she didn't want anybody at
the hotel to see who she was with.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.590
That was gabriel,chief.They're
ready for you at the morgue.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.640
Wonderful.

08:52.150 --> 08:56.480
Okay,uh,lieutenant tao,I
would like to talk to --

08:56.490 --> 08:57.660
no,thank
you --

08:57.670 --> 09:01.080
this jim hanson from the fiscal
operations department.

09:01.090 --> 09:04.470
All right.Thank you.

09:06.010 --> 09:10.050
So,chief,you really think maggie's
death had anything to do with us?

09:10.060 --> 09:11.450
I don't know,commander,

09:11.460 --> 09:17.190
but whoever was meeting her at lover's
lane wasn't just interested in maggie.

09:17.650 --> 09:20.360
They wanted her computer,too.

09:21.590 --> 09:24.480
Carry on,everybody.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.160
Can it wait?
I'm sitting on a wiretap.

09:37.170 --> 09:42.640
It won't take long, I have a dead employee 
from the department of homeland security 
by the name of Marguerite Scott,

09:42.650 --> 09:45.750
and I need you to get a
dump on her encrypted cellphone.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.920
Why don't you just download it?

09:49.180 --> 09:50.940
It's missing...

09:50.950 --> 09:53.870
along with her laptop,also encrypted.

09:55.990 --> 09:57.970
I don't know if I should
check on this for you.

09:57.980 --> 10:02.390
Oh,if I have to hear
one more time about how your
friends are making fun of you 
for doing me favors...

10:02.400 --> 10:05.970
I am recovering from surgery! Please!

10:05.980 --> 10:07.650
There are new rules in place.

10:07.660 --> 10:08.860
If you get
us involved --

10:08.870 --> 10:10.990
and I can't have chocolate anymore.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.460
Do you understand that?Do you?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.870
Please,just make the call.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.690
Okay,brenda.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.060
Marguerite scott.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.100
I'll make the call.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.340
Great suit.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.220
Did you get itat fred segal?

10:39.230 --> 10:39.970
Yeah.Yeah,I did.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.660
I know this girl there.She
gets me a discount.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.300
Love that place.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.140
I live just around the corner from there.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.650
Sorry that took so long.

10:48.660 --> 10:51.270
What --what
have you learned?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.760
It's a little complicated.

10:54.340 --> 10:57.680
Your vic survived the crash and was
well enough to climb out of the car

10:57.690 --> 10:59.430
and crawl her way up the hill.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.980
Crawl?

11:01.940 --> 11:04.840
- Are you sure she wasn't thrown out of the car?
- No.

11:05.180 --> 11:08.630
These are seat-belt bruises,which means
she was definitelystrapped in at impact.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.930
And then look...

11:11.290 --> 11:14.050
at the dirt under her nails,

11:14.060 --> 11:16.280
the abrasions on her knees and elbows.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.070
She crawled up that hill.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.230
The question ishow she was able to climb when she
expired instantly from massive trauma to the head.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.810
- But that didn't happen during the crash?
- No.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.090
I found a splinter in her head,

11:31.400 --> 11:35.390
indicating someone struck
her with a branch or a large stick.

11:35.980 --> 11:40.420
And the final blow might have come from
a rock after she drove off the cliff.

11:41.290 --> 11:42.840
Not her best day.

11:42.850 --> 11:45.750
Two last things -- notice anything
unusual about your vic's face?

11:47.590 --> 11:48.970
Don't make me guess.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.460
Coyotes always feed on the
body's soft tissue first.

11:51.470 --> 11:54.780
My guess is they left her face
alone because of the seasoning.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.740
Excuse me?

11:58.750 --> 12:01.280
Someone doused your
vic with pepper spray,

12:01.290 --> 12:04.560
which might explain why she drove
off the cliff in the first place.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.570
Maggie scott is dead?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.040
I'm afraid so,mr.Hanson.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.160
I'm so sorry about that.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.050
Oh,my god.

12:15.060 --> 12:18.480
The lapd was put through
this exhausting audit for nothing?

12:18.490 --> 12:22.000
Sorry to see you're so
broken up over maggie's death.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.270
No,no --yeah,I'm
sorry,all right?

12:24.280 --> 12:27.010
But the woman was a time waster.

12:27.020 --> 12:30.010
This section manages a
billion-dollar annual budget.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.780
2% of that comes from the dhs,

12:31.790 --> 12:36.070
yet I spent 80% of my
time justifying expenses to maggie.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.060
The woman was in my office every
other month for almost two years.

12:39.070 --> 12:42.740
You have no idea how much
extra work she created.

12:42.750 --> 12:47.510
During maggie's last visit out here,she
also stopped at a place called civilaudio.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.420
Do you have any idea what
she was looking for?

12:50.860 --> 12:53.140
This month it was civilaudio.I
have no idea what it was.

12:53.150 --> 12:55.860
Last month,it was --I
don't even remember.

12:55.870 --> 12:57.470
The point is it doesn't matter anymore.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.440
Why is that?

12:58.450 --> 13:03.050
Because the way the Federal operates,
It'll be ages before they send
anybody to pick up where she left off,

13:03.060 --> 13:04.690
if they even bother.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.070
Well,maybe we shouldn't
waitfor the federal government.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.750
Maybe you should let my detective
take a look at your books.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.560
Fine.I'll,uh

13:11.570 --> 13:13.580
I'll make sure you get
everything you need.

13:13.910 --> 13:19.480
Uh,mr.Hanson,do you know if 
maggie was seeing anyone 
romantically while she was here?

13:19.490 --> 13:20.990
Did she have a boyfriend?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.270
Or maybe she was having an
affair of some kind.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.440
She didn't discuss her
personal life with me,

13:25.450 --> 13:27.240
and I am not the type
of guy to spread rumors.

13:27.250 --> 13:31.190
So, if you excuse me..It's gonna 
take me a minute to put your 
paperwork through.

13:31.980 --> 13:32.860
You know what,though?

13:32.870 --> 13:35.660
I will offer one opinion,ma'am.

13:35.670 --> 13:40.680
Maybe you should let me 
spend more time helping
you fight crime and not
fighting accountants.

13:40.690 --> 13:42.550
That's just a thought.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.540
Watch your step.You'll
take nasty fall here.

13:51.550 --> 13:55.900
I'm so sorry to bother
youon a saturday,Mr.White,

13:55.930 --> 13:59.140
but according to our files,your
company provides the lapd

13:59.150 --> 14:02.470
and fire department
with first-responder communications.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.320
Civil audio's not my
company.I'm just the CFO.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.940
I've been there since 9/11.

14:06.950 --> 14:08.540
Before that,I was on the job.

14:08.550 --> 14:10.030
Lapd?

14:10.040 --> 14:11.670
Yes,ma'am.15 years.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.480
Tactical technology unit.

14:13.490 --> 14:17.300
So civil audio's a good fit -- better
pay,and no one ever shoots at me.

14:17.810 --> 14:21.610
Sorry about the
mess.Overbudget.Stupid contractor.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.350
Air-conditioner's out.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.010
I had to cancel the pool.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.850
Now I have two kids who are gonna be very
disappointed when they come 
back from summer camp.

14:29.830 --> 14:30.610
That's just tragic.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.840
Right this way.

14:32.230 --> 14:34.280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.060
It is hot.

14:42.020 --> 14:46.750
Mr.White,can you tell me what maggie scott
was doing in your office earlier this week?

14:49.770 --> 14:51.660
Auditors are like police officers.

14:51.670 --> 14:54.140
They don't tell you what they're
looking for until they find it.

14:54.150 --> 14:58.230
She wanted all our billing records
to lapd,so I gave them to her.Why?

14:58.240 --> 15:00.310
Is old maggie giving you a hard time?

15:00.320 --> 15:02.310
In a manner of speaking.

15:02.320 --> 15:06.810
Her car went over a cliff last
night,and we found her this morning,dead.

15:10.260 --> 15:13.020
Hey,I'm going for takeout.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.230
Something wrong?

15:16.890 --> 15:18.990
Well,yes and no.

15:19.310 --> 15:22.380
Remember that crazy womanI told you
about,the one from homeland security?

15:22.390 --> 15:24.260
The horrible accountant lady?

15:24.270 --> 15:25.860
She died last night.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.790
That's too bad.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.940
Gosh.

15:30.550 --> 15:31.560
Well...

15:31.570 --> 15:34.650
just get me whatever you're
having.Thanks.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.080
Sorry to interrupt.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.280
I've got to tell you,the outpouring
of sadness for this woman so far,

15:44.290 --> 15:46.940
it's -- it's touching.

15:46.950 --> 15:49.570
Obviously,I feel bad about what happened.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.430
I mean,it's terrible.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.200
But just the idea of going
through another audit with maggie --

15:54.210 --> 15:56.650
she's brutal.Just talk to your people.

15:56.660 --> 15:57.330
Ask jim hanson.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.690
I'm sorry.Did you say another audit?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.030
Starting monday morning.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.080
Jim hanson didn't mention that.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.480
Not that it was gonna be much different

16:05.490 --> 16:08.990
Maggie was investigating the way the
lapd paid us for almost two years.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.920
Poor jimmy.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.620
And his wife just left him,too.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.900
Look...

16:18.930 --> 16:21.820
I appreciatedmaggie's tenacity.I did

16:21.830 --> 16:25.050
But I just hope whoever takes her
place will be a little less rabid.

16:25.060 --> 16:28.140
Well,hanson said there
wouldn't be another audit.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.150
Well,that's wishful thinking.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.880
Dhs might not get to it right
away,but they'll be back.

16:36.340 --> 16:40.750
Hey,if we're done,uh,I got about three
timesas many people here as usual.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.320
I threaten to fire them,and
suddenly they can't finish fast enough.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.450
If there's anything I can
do,just let me know,okay?

16:52.460 --> 16:54.350
Thank you,sir.

16:54.870 --> 16:57.020
Thank you so much.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.110
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

17:10.079 --> 17:13.950
How long before you start
feeling the symptoms of poison oak?

17:13.960 --> 17:16.780
Probably not until tonight sometime.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.230
I told you not to go down there.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.589
Oh,I know.I know.

17:23.530 --> 17:24.800
Oh,come on.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.609
chief,no luck getting access
tomaggie scott's encrypted phone.

17:27.619 --> 17:30.970
I'm sure we'll be hearingfrom
the fbi any minute now.

17:31.870 --> 17:35.470
The victim's husband,uh,ken --
he just flew infrom washington.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.260
He's in your office.Maggie
scott'srental-car company called.

17:38.270 --> 17:41.340
Their accident investigators want to know
when they can get a lookat their hybrid.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.320
What did you tell them?

17:42.330 --> 17:45.560
What I always tell them
--sure.No problem.Then I hung up.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.410
The car's stillin the print shed.

17:47.420 --> 17:50.760
We hang onto maggie's car until
we know what happened to maggie.

17:51.380 --> 17:54.400
And I wantthat steering
wheel tested for pepper spray.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.100
How am I gonna tell that manhis
wife was eaten by coyotes?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.740
Poor woman.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.340
What are all these about?

18:09.350 --> 18:11.620
Financial recordsfrom jim hanson.

18:11.630 --> 18:12.940
Exactly what you would expect,chief.

18:12.950 --> 18:17.620
Bury the two paragraphs of information you
actually want in a big load of bull pucky.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.280
I'll start working on it,chief.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.580
Oh,bless you.Bless you.

18:28.170 --> 18:32.360
Nobody's told mewhen I can see my wife's
body,and I've been here almost an hour.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.420
Actually,sir,I think you might want to

18:34.430 --> 18:38.220
wait for a funeral home or mortuary
to take a look at your wife.

18:38.230 --> 18:40.910
Are you sure it's her?Are
you absolutely certain?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.430
I'm sorry,sir.Yes,I am.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.650
Is there anythingI should know?

18:46.480 --> 18:48.870
Did she die quickly?

18:48.880 --> 18:52.600
I...don't thinkshe saw it coming.

18:53.990 --> 18:56.910
Oh,god,I don't knowhow I'm
gonna tell our daughter.

18:58.700 --> 19:02.860
Sir,do you know anyone who might
have wanted to hurt your wife?

19:02.870 --> 19:06.490
Did she ever talk to
you about a threat or...

19:06.500 --> 19:07.960
no,no.

19:07.970 --> 19:11.150
The only thing maggie
ever complained about was the travel.

19:11.870 --> 19:15.960
I thinkshe was happier lately not having
to come back to L.A.Every other week.

19:15.970 --> 19:17.800
Every other week?

19:21.360 --> 19:25.870
According to dhs,maggie was in
los angeles every other month.

19:26.950 --> 19:30.380
Do you knowif she had other business
here,or did she have any relatives or friends?

19:30.390 --> 19:32.350
No,it was work.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.830
Why else would she come?

19:40.900 --> 19:42.780
Chief johnson,

19:42.790 --> 19:46.520
special agents blackburnand
horlacher from the fbi.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.010
It's about maggie scott.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.800
I'm --I'm
terribly sorry.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.480
I am right slap dab in the middle of
interviewing the victim's husband.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.680
Good to see you again,too,chief
johnson.Sorry to interrupt.

20:03.690 --> 20:05.970
But the fbi needs to
speakwith mr.Scott right now.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.720
I've been in touchwith
special agent fritz howard.

20:08.730 --> 20:12.250
***Thank you for informing
him about the encrypted laptop

20:12.260 --> 20:13.560
and cellphone that have gone missing.

20:13.570 --> 20:16.880
Which makes this investigation a
national-security issue.

20:16.890 --> 20:20.540
I hardly think maggie
scott was killed by terrorists,

20:20.550 --> 20:24.120
unless you thinkthe evildoers are trying
to destroy the world with pepper spray.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.600
We're talking about the
murderof a federal employee,

20:26.610 --> 20:28.620
plus the theftof classified materials.

20:28.630 --> 20:31.340
So we would like allthe
evidence you've collected.

20:31.350 --> 20:34.520
We're gonna take the victim'shusband
with us right now,too.

20:34.530 --> 20:37.820
If you have any furtherquestions
for mr.Scott,let us know.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.390
Great to see you again,ma'am.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.870
Oh,I bet.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.120
Ma'am.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.490
Lieutenants flynnand provenza,

20:48.500 --> 20:53.550
I'd like you to copyeverything that we have
before we hand it offto these gentlemen.

20:53.560 --> 20:59.630
And,detective daniels,please give the
boxes forfiscal operations to the fbi**

20:59.640 --> 21:03.080
And while they're lookingat our
finances,let's take a lookat mr.Hanson'S.

21:03.090 --> 21:04.510
Thank you.

21:05.210 --> 21:09.380
Lieutenant tao,please putthe
car's computer in the desk.

21:10.110 --> 21:14.770
And,uh,detective sanchez,I'd like youto move
maggie's rental car out of the print shed.

21:14.780 --> 21:15.310
To where?

21:15.320 --> 21:17.570
Someplacethe fbi won't find it.

21:28.180 --> 21:30.600
Listen,just
because --

21:31.540 --> 21:35.670
just because the fbiis starting an
investigation doesn't meanyou have to halt yours.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.800
Let them look for the
laptop.You find the killer.

21:37.810 --> 21:40.600
Well,I still have lots
ofquestions for maggie's husband.

21:40.610 --> 21:41.310
******

21:41.320 --> 21:45.080
He's the only personso far who
seems at all upsetabout her death.

21:45.090 --> 21:46.730
But here's the thing,will.

21:46.740 --> 21:52.030
Maggie was visiting los angelesevery other week
last year for reasonsother than dhs business.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.680
She lied to her husbandabout that,

21:53.690 --> 21:58.120
and her carwent over a hillside at
a place where peoplesometimes go to...

21:58.770 --> 22:00.180
you know.

22:00.190 --> 22:03.340
So I'm guessing that she
mighthave been having an affair.

22:03.350 --> 22:08.090
I can promise youwho she was seeing last
year has nothing to dowith her death.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.340
How can you say that?

22:09.350 --> 22:12.020
Because the affairshe
was having was with me.

22:14.890 --> 22:18.770
When were you ing to tell methat you
had been sleepingwith my murder victim?

22:19.220 --> 22:21.770
Well,there wasn'treally
so much sleeping.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.870
Do you want tohear about this,or
do you justwant to get all mad?

22:25.880 --> 22:28.270
I'm investigatingher murder,will.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.100
Okay,you want to get mad.

22:31.690 --> 22:35.980
Look,we met about a year ago,

22:35.990 --> 22:40.340
and we started seeing each
otherwhenever she was in town.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.070
Every other week.

22:43.930 --> 22:49.340
I flew her out sometimes and
put her upat the cielo hotel.

22:50.350 --> 22:52.840
And it endedsix months ago.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.570
I was never involvedin
any of her audits,

22:54.580 --> 22:57.990
so there's no conflictof
interest,and her husbandnever knew.

23:00.020 --> 23:03.280
So you were seeing maggie while
you were still marriedto estelle.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.550
Technically,yes,

23:06.560 --> 23:09.800
but after estellefiled for divorce.

23:10.050 --> 23:14.030
Look,estelle was
alreadyseeing someone else.

23:14.040 --> 23:18.550
I was pretty much
alone,as you well know.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.840
What should I have done?Should
I havejust stopped living?***

23:26.850 --> 23:30.470
She was married!You couldn't
have foundsomeone single?

23:35.750 --> 23:37.570
Forget it.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.130
Are there e-mails from
youon her computer?

23:44.140 --> 23:46.510
Not onthe government account.

23:47.120 --> 23:51.930
I mean,did she evercheck personal
mail on her encrypted laptop?

23:52.150 --> 23:53.660
I don't know.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.520
What?

23:59.760 --> 24:01.680
What?

24:02.130 --> 24:07.970
There'sa female investigator
working foran intelligence agency,

24:07.980 --> 24:09.620
who was in a relationship,

24:09.630 --> 24:15.380
who you seduced into coming to
los angeleson a regular basis.

24:15.780 --> 24:20.980
It all sounds so familiar,and
yet,um,I'm surprised.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.230
Do you want to...talk about this?

24:27.850 --> 24:30.100
In detail?

24:30.590 --> 24:32.720
- Drop it.
- 'Cause we can.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.970
Drop it,I said.

24:37.700 --> 24:42.940
And tell mewhat else you know
about the victimthat can help me.

24:45.020 --> 24:48.380
Maggie was...honest.

24:49.760 --> 24:54.160
Except about mewith her
husband,she was an honest person.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.550
She wasa relentless investigator.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.750
She,uh,believed in what she was doing.

25:03.590 --> 25:08.350
Her personal lifemay have been a bit of
a mess,but she wasextremely professional.

25:09.990 --> 25:13.730
And she was stubbornwhen she was right,

25:15.750 --> 25:18.460
which shealmost always was.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.270
Thanks.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.510
Wait.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.210
I now howthis is going to sound,but
the outcomeof this investigation,

25:35.220 --> 25:39.070
the timing of it,could
affectmy custody agreement.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.200
My kids.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.460
Right.

25:47.020 --> 25:50.550
Well,I'll try to find outwhat happened
to maggie beforethat becomes an issue.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.510
Thank you.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.280
Look...

25:56.510 --> 25:58.130
I'M...

25:58.590 --> 26:00.480
really sorry.

26:00.490 --> 26:01.950
Again.

26:03.950 --> 26:07.290
You're really sorryagain.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.800
Yes,gentlemen?

26:25.850 --> 26:28.270
What morecan I do for you today?

26:28.340 --> 26:33.990
Maybe we weren't clearwhen we said we want
everything you haveon the maggie scott case.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.550
You have her husband.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.190
We're handing overthe
rest of our evidence.

26:37.210 --> 26:38.270
What more do you need?

26:38.300 --> 26:40.350
We need the car mrs.Scottwas
driving when she crashed.

26:40.380 --> 26:41.750
It's not ******

26:41.770 --> 26:43.000
It's got to bearound here somewhere.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.520
It was certainly in no
conditionto go driving off.

26:45.530 --> 26:49.460
The fbi issueda
national-security letter,

26:49.470 --> 26:54.080
which compels youto turn over
every aspect of your case to us.

26:54.130 --> 26:56.110
And when investingmatters
of this import,

26:56.160 --> 26:58.530
we shouldn't even be
dealingwith you at all,really,

26:58.560 --> 27:01.810
but ratherthe homicide task force
in your owncounterterrorism bureau.

27:01.850 --> 27:02.920
Wait.

27:02.930 --> 27:04.270
Okay. No problem.

27:04.290 --> 27:04.990
What?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.450
Just one moment,chief.

27:06.480 --> 27:09.980
If we hook you guys up with our
counterterrorismbureau's homicide task force,

27:09.990 --> 27:11.890
you guys will be coolwith
a joint operation?

27:11.910 --> 27:14.390
You would haveno more complaints?

27:15.090 --> 27:16.610
None.

27:16.820 --> 27:18.230
Great. Let's do it.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.310
All right,then.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.930
Follow me,gentlemen.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.780
COUNTER TERROR SQUAD

27:34.290 --> 27:35.070
What the hell is this?

27:35.110 --> 27:40.600
You guys said you wanted to work 
with the homicide task force of lapd's
counter terrorism bureau.

27:40.620 --> 27:42.010
That would be us.

27:42.050 --> 27:44.370
We even passed our
weapons-of-mass-destruction training.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.080
This is a bunch of crap.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.620
This is not what we agreed to.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.750
Oh,I'm so sorry,agent blackbird.

27:50.780 --> 27:52.200
It's exactlywhat we agreed to.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.050
But it's alsonot my problem.

27:54.090 --> 27:57.910
Lieutenants provenzaand i aren't
part ofthe ctb's homicide task force.

27:57.930 --> 28:00.840
You'll have to address
yourconcerns to lieutenant flynn.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.700
We want the car.

28:02.740 --> 28:05.500
We gave you the gps
informationfrom the car's computer.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.670
We still need the car.

28:06.690 --> 28:07.510
What for?

28:07.540 --> 28:08.950
Uh,yoo-hoo.

28:09.570 --> 28:12.540
This really isn't my
business,but,detective sanchez,

28:12.580 --> 28:15.690
do you know where these
menmight find maggie's prius?

28:17.560 --> 28:22.060
Uh,well,it was probably
towedto the central garage.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.140
I could take you there.

28:23.150 --> 28:24.850
Why don't you do that,huh?

28:24.850 --> 28:27.850
Sirs,don't forgetyour evidence.

28:30.090 --> 28:32.190
Hey,hey,hey,hey!

28:33.090 --> 28:35.490
Just the boxes,boys.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.650
The cart belongs to lapd.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.340
Make sure you liftwith your legs.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.050
Don't hurt yourself.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.920
Payback's a bitch,boys.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.990
Chief,I checked the
prius'sonline service manual.

28:57.050 --> 29:00.080
If you use a cellphone witha
bluetooth wireless connection,

29:00.090 --> 29:01.630
you can makecalls through the car.

29:01.650 --> 29:05.260
Maggie's prius probablyhas a record
of numbers she dialed and received.

29:05.290 --> 29:07.290
That's why the fbiwanted the car.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.450
They can't get into maggie'sencrypted
cellphone yet,either.

29:10.500 --> 29:14.610
Well,it is our patriotic
dutyto help them out.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.870
Let's go take a look.

29:16.930 --> 29:21.240
The prius's bluetooth systemisn't really designed
to display the informationwithout the menu.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.440
We tinkered around a littleand
found the phone numbers.

29:24.470 --> 29:26.020
And here they are in order.

29:26.050 --> 29:31.290
And the last callmaggie scott received
came from joe white,the cfo of civilaudio.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.340
Right after that,she punched in the
address of wherewe found her body.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.400
While I'm lookinginto
mr.Hanson's finances --

29:36.430 --> 29:39.610
Yes, thank you. Detective Daniels
please lookinto mr.White'S.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.830
I knew joe whitewhen he was on the job.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.140
There's no way he'dmurder anyone.

29:43.170 --> 29:43.990
It's ridiculous.

29:44.010 --> 29:47.120
Well,joe was a bit of a
playerwhen he was around here.

29:47.140 --> 29:51.540
Maybe he and maggiewere doing the big
nasty and she was gonnatell his wife.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.860
You think whitewould try to take
somebody out with a canof pepper spray?

29:54.880 --> 29:55.920
come on

30:02.460 --> 30:04.320
You can't keep doing this.

30:04.610 --> 30:05.610
Doing what?

30:05.640 --> 30:06.640
Being angry at me.

30:06.670 --> 30:10.350
You insisted -- insisted--
I get the fbi involved.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.540
I'm not angry.

30:29.570 --> 30:30.660
So,what is this?

30:30.680 --> 30:33.250
So I recognizethe mood
when I see it again.

30:33.310 --> 30:34.780
It's disappointment.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.420
You knew what would happen when
you called your buddiesat the fbi,

30:39.430 --> 30:41.530
and you didn't tell me.

30:42.110 --> 30:43.890
I'm a little let down,frankly.

30:43.990 --> 30:45.810
I told you the requestwas a bad idea.

30:45.830 --> 30:47.330
You demandedI do it anyway.

30:47.350 --> 30:50.060
Then you hung up on
mebefore I could explain.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.680
And you're saying i let you down?

30:52.980 --> 30:59.310
Well,just be aware,most of the time,I'm
never gonna askfor your help again.

30:59.390 --> 31:03.930
That is fine,because what happened
here,in reality,is you confided in me,

31:03.970 --> 31:05.640
and I tried to do
somethingabout your problem.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.000
And apparently,I just made it worse.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.370
That's exactlywhat happened.

31:13.950 --> 31:16.470
You tried to help me,and
you only made it worse.

31:17.540 --> 31:21.210
Let's see if I can't providethat
same kind of help to the fbi.

31:25.430 --> 31:27.120
Don't scratch!

31:31.130 --> 31:36.570
As cfo of civilaudio,joseph white
pulls innearly $500,000 a year.

31:36.570 --> 31:38.550
That's a lot of radios,chief.

31:38.710 --> 31:41.000
A ton more cashthan he was making here.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.800
But his new residence cost three
times as muchas he got for his condo,

31:44.820 --> 31:48.380
which,for the record,is two blocks
away from the scene of the accident,

31:48.390 --> 31:50.370
right above academy road.

31:50.590 --> 31:52.420
He knew the area well.

31:53.430 --> 31:56.390
Joe white paid $1.5
millionfor this house?

31:56.430 --> 31:59.450
Oh,how are we ever gonnabe
able to afford a new house?

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
How?

32:00.660 --> 32:02.410
And for the past two years,

32:02.430 --> 32:08.580
mr.White has been spending more than doublehis
declared income without incurringany obvious debt.

32:08.610 --> 32:11.570
It's like he's pulling moneyfrom
someplace off the books.

32:11.590 --> 32:15.370
He did,however,cancel a chargeto
his contractor four days ago.

32:15.410 --> 32:18.270
He was complainingabout
them going overbudget.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.590
But there were constructionworkers
in his backyard.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.220
Saturday morning,the
charges were reauthorized,

32:23.240 --> 32:26.810
provided thatthe contractor would guarantee
everything would be finishedin three weeks.

32:26.830 --> 32:32.710
Timeline --maggie scott drops by
joe white's officeat civilaudio,

32:32.730 --> 32:36.150
tells joe that,uh,his
accountingdoesn't quite add up.

32:36.180 --> 32:41.680
That night,maggie flies off a
cliff,and joecontinues his remodel.

32:41.730 --> 32:42.780
Do-da,do-da.

32:42.810 --> 32:44.390
Sing whatever songyou want.

32:44.400 --> 32:49.080
I still don't believejoe white would have
anything to dowith something like this.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.400
He was building a pool.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.460
He didn't want todisappoint the family.

32:53.700 --> 32:58.660
And what about jim hanson,our
fiscal operations director?

32:59.010 --> 33:01.200
His divorce left himstrapped for cash.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.200
Almost maxed outon all
of his credit cards.

33:03.230 --> 33:06.250
But his personal investments seem solid.

33:08.590 --> 33:14.630
Detective sanchez,where did you last see
special agents black burn and horlacher?

33:14.650 --> 33:16.850
They were checking our
impound facilities,

33:16.890 --> 33:19.370
but I had the car moved
againa few hours ago.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.790
They'll never find it.

33:20.820 --> 33:21.590
Excellent.

33:21.620 --> 33:22.520
Uh,lieutenant flynn,

33:22.550 --> 33:26.450
please call our fbi friends and tell them
what we've discovered about joe white.

33:26.510 --> 33:29.100
Chief,we share our
information with the fbi,

33:29.120 --> 33:34.320
they're likely to take matters into their
own hands and makeour situation worse.

33:34.450 --> 33:36.540
That is the established
pattern,lieutenant.

33:36.570 --> 33:38.890
Let's hope it holds onfor another day.

33:51.890 --> 33:53.180
Gentlemen,gentlemen!

33:53.240 --> 33:54.900
Gentlemen,I have to ask you to wait.

33:54.910 --> 33:55.600
Excuse me

33:55.610 --> 33:57.230
You cannot take white awaylike this.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.710
We called you,remember?

33:58.750 --> 34:02.120
Sergeant,we're
questioningmr.White today.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.470
It could be you'llhave
a crack at him later.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.970
We agreed to share our information.

34:07.850 --> 34:09.630
All right,just for you.

34:09.699 --> 34:14.060
Mr.White here seems to have faked
civilaudio's invoices to police

34:14.080 --> 34:16.080
and fire departments all
through the southwest,

34:16.090 --> 34:19.550
adding on a little surcharge for every
radio he sold and keeping itfor himself.

34:19.570 --> 34:21.440
And the victim knew all about it.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.659
****

34:35.179 --> 34:36.310
Chief,where are you going?

34:36.350 --> 34:40.520
Hopefully,I'm gonna find out where maggie's
encrypted cellphone and computer are.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.380
This isall a terrible mistake.

34:45.420 --> 34:49.570
Joe would never
kill anyone,except maybe in self-defense.

34:49.639 --> 34:50.690
He was a police officer.

34:50.710 --> 34:52.989
Our accident investigators agree.

34:53.040 --> 34:56.330
They say maggie's car drove
straight over that cliff.

34:56.389 --> 34:58.970
Oh,you have to tell
that to the fbi,please.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.970
Oh,I will. I will.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.600
But what I was wondering is why you
didn't just tell them that yourself.

35:04.670 --> 35:05.480
Tell them what?

35:05.510 --> 35:08.740
That you were there,that
you witnessed the accident.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.770
But I wasn't there.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.570
Mrs.White,I'm not gonna lie to you.

35:11.620 --> 35:16.700
Leaving the sceneof an accident is punishable
by 6 monthsin prison or a $10,000 fine.

35:16.730 --> 35:20.540
Before we talk about it,I
should inform you of your rights.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.040
You have the right to remain silent.

35:23.060 --> 35:26.140
Anything you say canand
will be used against you.

35:26.170 --> 35:27.420
You have the rightto an attorney.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.660
If you cannot affordan attorney,one
will be appointed to youby the state.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.240
Have you heard and
understood these rights?

35:33.760 --> 35:35.070
Yes.

35:35.140 --> 35:38.350
Now,if you really want
to help your husband --

35:38.380 --> 35:39.780
I do. Of course I do.

35:39.810 --> 35:42.040
Then you're gonna have to fess up.

35:42.090 --> 35:46.100
Because I know that you were there when
maggie scott drove herself off that cliff.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.490
Why do you think that?

35:47.510 --> 35:50.810
The last call she
received was from this house.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.680
And immediately following the phone call,

35:52.710 --> 35:55.860
she punched in an address to
the gps system on her prius,

35:55.870 --> 35:59.730
an address only four blocks from the
condo where you and joe used to live.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.030
She

36:02.980 --> 36:07.810
and she drove there for a
spur-of-the-moment meeting of some kind.

36:07.850 --> 36:13.260
Now,I don't thinkshe would agree to meet alone
at night in a deserted corner of the world

36:13.270 --> 36:16.660
with anyone she was about
to accuse of embezzlement.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.460
Now,if I'm wrong,mrs.White,just tell me.

36:20.950 --> 36:23.710
If it was your husband she
was meeting with,not you,

36:23.750 --> 36:26.450
if our accident
investigators made a mistake --

36:26.480 --> 36:29.030
no. No.

36:30.390 --> 36:33.200
Listen,let me --let
me just explain.

36:33.370 --> 36:37.120
What joe did was not embezzlement at all.

36:37.160 --> 36:42.450
He borroweda little bit of money because
we went so far over budget with this remodel.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.190
Our contractor lied to us
about what everything would cost.

36:45.210 --> 36:49.430
And we have this adjustable mortgage,and
the payments have skyrocketed.

36:49.460 --> 36:52.480
We put everything we
have into this house.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.980
Joe was just trying to keep
usfrom losing our life savings.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.590
And...

36:58.240 --> 37:00.330
I wanted mrs.Scott to know that.

37:00.350 --> 37:02.220
That sounds reasonable.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.090
So you wanted to explain that to her.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.900
So I called her,and I
told her where to meet me.

37:06.950 --> 37:10.930
I said I had some information she
needed for her audit.

37:11.030 --> 37:12.790
I was waiting for her.

37:12.810 --> 37:15.840
When she drove
up,she,um --

37:15.880 --> 37:19.450
she rolled down the window without
turning off her engine.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.290
I told her -- I said ifshe
would just give us a month,

37:22.310 --> 37:23.490
joe would make things right,

37:23.520 --> 37:28.300
that he would flip the house and put all
the money he borrowed back with interest.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.460
She agreed?

37:29.480 --> 37:31.080
No. She didn't.

37:31.130 --> 37:33.000
She said joe would go to jail,

37:33.010 --> 37:37.440
she was going to report him,that
she was just following orders.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.280
I argued with her,and
she got really mad.

37:40.310 --> 37:44.250
And she drove off and
missed the turn and --

37:44.260 --> 37:47.930
and drove over the side of the cliff.

37:47.950 --> 37:50.460
Oh, I was just so upset.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.920
I got back into my car,and I drove away.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.880
You could have called someone and
waited for them to arrive.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.870
I know I should have.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.300
I know.

37:59.320 --> 38:03.100
But it was dark,and I was afraid.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.010
And I'm sorry.

38:04.030 --> 38:07.050
I'm so,so,so sorry.

38:07.090 --> 38:10.160
So sorry that you got in
touch with your contractor

38:10.190 --> 38:14.390
and told him to have his workers
finish up the remodel of your house?

38:14.470 --> 38:15.690
Listen!

38:15.710 --> 38:18.860
I was just making the
best of a terrible situation.

38:18.910 --> 38:21.490
I thought if we could get the
house in shape to sell,

38:21.510 --> 38:26.540
joe had time to repay the money,

38:26.560 --> 38:28.630
which is what I told that
woman we wanted to do.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.430
But she wouldn't listen.

38:30.460 --> 38:35.390
Well,that might have been because of the
pepper spray that you spewed all over her face.

38:37.960 --> 38:42.870
That's a report from our scientific investigation
division and the L.A.County coroner's office

38:42.900 --> 38:47.070
documenting that there was pepper spray on
the victim's face and the steering wheel.

38:47.090 --> 38:50.870
Which is another reason I knew that
it was you and not your husband,

38:50.890 --> 38:52.230
because the
attack was so inept --

38:52.240 --> 38:55.020
there was no attack!

38:55.780 --> 38:57.850
That woman --she reached
through the window,

38:57.870 --> 39:02.760
grabbed me by the arm,and tried
to drag me along the road.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.320
She must have given
your arm quite a bruise.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.260
Could I see that,please?

39:08.400 --> 39:09.860
No?

39:11.340 --> 39:13.880
That makes me wonder,mrs.White,

39:13.910 --> 39:16.300
what elsedo you have up your sleeve?

39:17.810 --> 39:19.600
It's been awfully hot here lately.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.460
Your husband's in shorts and a t-shirt.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.920
Sergeant gabriel here took his
jacket off the moment we sat down.

39:23.950 --> 39:27.590
And yet here you are,all
covered up,head to toe.

39:31.750 --> 39:34.560
That is exactly the type of
rash I'd expect to see on someone

39:34.590 --> 39:38.870
who was begging for mercy with
a can of pepper spray.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.570
You may notice that I've
gota similar rash on my legs.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.640
Like you,I didn'tget
anything on my hands.

39:43.670 --> 39:46.370
That's because we were
both wearing gloves

39:46.390 --> 39:49.640
when we were standing in the poison
oak over maggie scott's body.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.810
She didn't die in that crash,did she?

39:54.130 --> 39:55.070
No.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.880
No,she pulled herself up out of that car

39:58.910 --> 40:03.770
and, crying for help,crawled
her way back up to the road.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.430
She had a husband and a daughter.

40:05.460 --> 40:06.570
She was trying to see them again.

40:06.590 --> 40:09.250
She was doing everything she could,

40:09.290 --> 40:10.050
but you wouldn't let her.

40:10.070 --> 40:11.440
Stop. Please stop.

40:11.460 --> 40:13.250
Please stop?

40:14.270 --> 40:16.890
Is that what maggie said

40:16.910 --> 40:20.110
as you hiked down the side of the
hill and beat her with a tree branch?

40:20.140 --> 40:23.460
Was she begging you to stop before
you crushed her skull in

40:23.480 --> 40:26.290
and then left her body to
be torn apart by coyotes?

40:26.310 --> 40:27.570
Please stop!

40:27.590 --> 40:30.090
It was far too latefor please stop.

40:30.110 --> 40:34.220
I was only trying to help my husband.

40:36.980 --> 40:39.750
Let's skip the part where you
try to explain yourself.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.560
I just don't have the
stomach for it today.

40:53.740 --> 40:56.630
Because there's something
else I need to know,mrs.White --

40:56.650 --> 40:59.600
the whereabouts of an
encrypted cellphone and a computer.

40:59.650 --> 41:02.360
And it is somethingI
really need to know.

41:08.110 --> 41:10.050
That smells good.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.140
For all your help.

41:12.710 --> 41:16.190
Even without trying,you always do.

41:18.470 --> 41:22.760
Still,nobody knows who maggie was
seeing all this time she came to L.A.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.780
Yeah,well,some secrets are
best taken to the grave.

41:25.820 --> 41:28.670
Oh,uh,speaking of maggie...

41:29.280 --> 41:33.070
here are her computer and cellphone.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.560
I don't know which is which.

41:34.590 --> 41:39.650
Maybe youcould hand them over to
agent blackbirdwith my regards.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.170
Where did you find them?

41:43.890 --> 41:46.660
Susan white smashed them to bits

41:46.710 --> 41:51.640
and put them in a dumpster behind a nearby
home depot along with the can of pepper spray.

41:51.690 --> 41:52.600
Nice.

41:52.630 --> 41:55.600
Got anotherlittle baggie in
there with maggie's priusin it?

41:55.610 --> 41:58.060
I'm sureit'll turn up by and by.

42:02.040 --> 42:03.320
The fedswill take the residence.

42:03.340 --> 42:07.890
And after we sue civil audio,our money
problems will go from terminal to merely bad.

42:07.930 --> 42:11.960
Sir,if I might offer a suggestion,being
that it was priority homicide --

42:12.000 --> 42:15.190
actually,this is the first arrest
of our new ctb homicide task force.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.160
- so congratulations
- oh, thank you sir

42:17.170 --> 42:20.620
I was wondering if some of the money could
be applied to priority homicide's budget.

42:20.660 --> 42:24.560
The idea of losing personnelat
this phase is just,uh --

42:25.200 --> 42:26.900
oh,no.

42:28.690 --> 42:30.590
Well,that's not my car.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.710
No,sir. It's not.

42:36.510 --> 42:39.120
Sergeant,where is my car?

42:40.260 --> 42:43.130
Sir,I think in an effort to
maintain access to the vehicle

42:43.150 --> 42:45.630
and other evidence pertaining
to the murder,

42:45.650 --> 42:46.990
someone must
have thought --

42:47.020 --> 42:50.060
you're just making all this up
off the top of your head,right?

42:50.080 --> 42:51.070
I am,sir.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.070
I don't know how this
happened. This is terrible.

42:53.090 --> 42:54.540
Go find my car.

42:54.570 --> 42:56.900
I'm finding it right now,sir.

42:56.910 --> 42:58.030
Thank you.
