01:44.600 --> 01:46.238
Hotcha!

01:48.920 --> 01:51.275
Another penny closer to retirement.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.349
Hey, Bundy, car broken down again?

01:54.560 --> 01:57.358
Nobody will give you a ride, huh?

01:57.600 --> 02:01.229
Maybe I should have called your wife.
She always gives everybody a ride.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.713
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Bundy.

02:08.919 --> 02:12.708
<i>Did the new copy of
Girls With Big 'Uns come in yet?</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:15.876
Yeah, I just think I'll...

02:16.080 --> 02:18.674
...look before I purchase if...

02:27.840 --> 02:29.398
There you go, just...

02:29.600 --> 02:31.716
I'll buy it tomorrow, Jim.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.000
- Sign this petition and save the trees.
- Who cares?

02:36.200 --> 02:39.476
Sign this petition to save the world
from nuclear holocaust.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.355
- Who cares?
- They're gonna raise beer tax two cents.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.358
Oh, my God!

02:45.680 --> 02:47.113
This has to be stopped.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.071
Let us give you a beer
and tell you about it.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.913
Why ask why?

02:56.160 --> 02:59.470
<i>Oh, wait, would you like to watch
our movie, The Story of Beer?</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:01.591
God, would I.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.150
<i>Beer.</i>

03:25.440 --> 03:26.919
And even for people like you...

03:27.160 --> 03:29.435
...Election Day is very important.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.235
So I'm hoping you'll put up these
campaign signs outside your home.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.152
That is a wonderful idea, Marcie.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.830
This one could cover the bird doody
on the front of the house.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.270
Oh, and this is a pretty one.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.756
We could put this on the porch
where the plaster's coming away.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.077
You know, where Al likes to kick it
before he comes in.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.512
Wait a minute, Mrs. D'Arcy.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.234
"Support toxic waste dumps"?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.311
You'd never vote for this.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.872
Of course not. I've given you posters
of the issues that I oppose.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.594
Because if people think
the Bundys are for them...

04:04.800 --> 04:07.837
...we know the whole neighbourhood
will vote the other way.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.230
We like to call it " harnessing hate. "

04:13.480 --> 04:17.519
Well, anything short of voting,
we'd be glad to help.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.271
Peggy, you really should vote.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.278
This year we can
really make a difference.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.392
This is the Year of the Woman.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.636
Everyone I know
is gonna vote for a woman...

04:28.840 --> 04:32.594
...regardless of her qualifications
or her stance on the issues.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.717
Right, Jefferson?

04:34.920 --> 04:36.114
Sure.

04:36.320 --> 04:39.915
Actually, I wouldn't mind having
a woman as president...

04:40.120 --> 04:42.998
...especially if it was you, Marcie.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.317
Because I'd make a great first lady.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.909
Yep, and I'd have
a big, important issue like...

04:51.120 --> 04:52.792
...no littering...

04:53.000 --> 04:54.558
...or nice hair for everyone.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.150
You know,
national hair-care centres.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.275
God, how cool.

05:02.160 --> 05:06.597
Well, I think I could do a lot of good
being in bed with the president.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.995
And I really believe that
if anybody could...

05:10.200 --> 05:13.476
...I could make them forget
about Jackie Kennedy.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.269
And you know I don't mind
prancing it for the voters.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.354
And then, when you get shot...

05:27.920 --> 05:30.718
...I'd marry a rich Greek.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.720
Of course, she'd have to
shave her legs...

05:34.920 --> 05:36.592
...and under her arms...

05:36.800 --> 05:38.836
...oh, and her lip.

05:39.720 --> 05:44.475
Then she'd die, leave me a fortune
and I'd become an editor.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.398
Well, what are you staring at?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.194
Like you never thought about
being first lady?

06:01.640 --> 06:05.269
Honey, shut up and look beautiful.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.948
I'll sign that bill.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.274
Hi, Peggy...

06:20.480 --> 06:22.596
...Bud, Kelly, Jefferson...

06:23.480 --> 06:24.879
...Bud.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.913
I just found out
what's wrong with America.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.910
And I seem to have lost
about three hours of my day.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.229
Bought this bunch of bananas.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.710
Kids, take those bananas upstairs...

06:39.920 --> 06:44.152
...with the tangerines Daddy bought
the last time he got whacked.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.953
God, I hate to see him like this.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.311
I know. I don't like
to see him happy either.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.231
Family, did you know that
along with an election coming up...

06:57.440 --> 06:58.998
...there's something big going on.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.868
They're trying to sneak by
a two-cent beer tax.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.274
Two cents!

07:04.480 --> 07:05.708
What really gets to me is...

07:05.920 --> 07:09.549
...that the money they're gonna raise
is gonna go for education.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.470
Well, I'll be damned
if I'm paying two cents...

07:12.680 --> 07:14.989
...for some moron
to learn how to read.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.278
I mean, where's it gonna end?

07:17.480 --> 07:20.677
I mean, pretty soon
they'll be taxing income.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.669
Well, Al, it's nice to see you care
about something...

07:25.880 --> 07:28.030
...besides wondering
whose back is hairier.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.118
Yours or your dog's.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.032
Or whose chest is hairier.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.435
Mine or yours.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.151
Jefferson, can I depend
on your support?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.834
Well, I'm sorry, Al,
I don't get a ballot.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.715
Marcie sends mine out absentee
so she's sure what I'm voting for.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.309
But I'm gonna be
first lady, you know.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.950
Give 'em hell.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.755
Come on, Marcie, you above all people
should be concerned about this tax.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.192
I mean, after looking at yourself
in the mirror all day, you must drink.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.071
I do not drink.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.794
I occasionally imbibe.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.319
And only wine.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.397
And then only with a fine meal.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.874
Or a good cheese.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.514
Or to enhance sex.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.518
Or if I'm alone for 15 minutes.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.229
But luckily, they're not trying
to increase the tax on wine.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.919
That would be unfair to the rich.

08:32.559 --> 08:35.916
So wine is free, eh?

08:36.120 --> 08:37.758
The workingman pays for everything.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.111
But a few French people and
a couple of guys that don't like girls...

08:41.320 --> 08:43.150
...they get off for free.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.272
Peggy, can you talk
some sense into him?

08:47.040 --> 08:51.716
I'm sorry, Marcie, but I have to agree
with Al, 100 percent.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.549
You see, if it wasn't for beer,
we probably wouldn't even be married.

08:56.560 --> 09:01.759
In fact, the only time Al touches me
is when he's had eight to 10 beers.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.713
Oh, and he's an animal.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.477
Oh, God, I love it.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.319
Would you excuse us?

09:23.320 --> 09:28.075
Oh, Al, you were magnificent!

09:31.880 --> 09:35.509
Honey, no, you can't
go to sleep now.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.393
We have company, come on.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.954
Well, I guess I can't persuade you
on the beer tax...

09:46.160 --> 09:49.152
...since it brings you so many
seconds of pleasure.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.676
But this is an important election.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.950
It's all gonna come down to
just a few votes...

09:55.160 --> 09:57.355
...so I need to mention
some of the other issues.

09:57.560 --> 10:02.270
For instance, a tax that will go
towards purifying Chicago's air.

10:02.520 --> 10:06.149
They want me to pay so that
people like you can breathe fresh air.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.834
- Peg, write that down.
- Got it.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.508
" No" on clean air.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.034
All right.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.518
Well, would you consider the plight
of the speckled songbird?

10:17.720 --> 10:19.517
To preserve its melodious tone...

10:19.720 --> 10:22.109
...we must protect this area
from further development.

10:22.360 --> 10:26.876
So those little bastards can sit outside
and sing all night and I don't sleep?

10:27.080 --> 10:30.675
- Peg, write that down.
- " No" to nature. Got it.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.236
Now, Marcie, how do
these moronic issues...

10:34.440 --> 10:36.158
...ever even come to the public?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.630
Well, they're suggested
by your elected officials.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.354
Your councilmen, your senators,
even your president.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.353
So it goes right to the top, huh?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.677
Well, something has to be done.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.196
Kids, get down here right away.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.516
I have something
very important to tell you.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.435
Finally. He's gonna tell me
I'm not really his daughter.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.037
No, he's gonna tell me
I'm not his son.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.276
But you look just like him.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.789
That was pretty low.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.358
I'm sorry, I went too far.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.676
I'm really sorry.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.751
Good luck, I hope you're not his.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.188
I hope you're not.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.639
Dad, who's our real father?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.790
Well, about a thousand
blood tests say it's me.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.673
Now, kids, the U.S.A.
has been run too long...

11:31.880 --> 11:33.757
...by people who know the issues.

11:33.960 --> 11:38.590
<i>People that watch the news on TV,
read books, generally pay attention.</i>

11:38.800 --> 11:40.028
Well, no more.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.552
Because now it's time that we
had a say in the future of America.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.028
Family...

11:47.520 --> 11:50.398
...the Bundys are gonna
elect a president.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.316
The polls have been open
across the nation for six hours...

12:02.520 --> 12:06.229
...but it's now official
that not a single person in America...

12:06.440 --> 12:09.159
...has yet turned out to vote.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.559
Not only that, Bob...

12:11.760 --> 12:15.799
...but I understand that nobody's
even watching our election coverage.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.874
So I've been told to do
whatever it takes to get you to tune in.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.956
<i>You won't see that on F Troop, folks.</i>

12:33.040 --> 12:36.157
Now that I have
your attention, be aware...

12:36.360 --> 12:39.318
...if any people show up
to vote today...

12:39.520 --> 12:44.514
...the future of this country
is in their hands.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.396
<i>Voters coming through.
Make way, make way.</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.875
<i>Voters coming through.</i>

12:55.480 --> 12:59.519
Family, breathe the democracy.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.639
This is where it all happens.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.237
Yes, in a dry cleaner like this,
they elected Washington and Lincoln.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.836
And at a round table,
where this volunteer sits...

13:10.040 --> 13:12.918
...they signed
the Declaration of Independence.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.913
And from the looks of her,
she was probably there to see it.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.993
Peg, get a picture of me
and Betsy Ross here.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.508
All right.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.631
Now, down to business.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.628
I'm Bundy...

13:29.840 --> 13:31.159
...Al Bundy...

13:31.360 --> 13:33.555
...and I'm here to serve my country.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.713
Then please consider
a minty mouthwash.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.598
Just give me a ballot, you crone.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.509
Not there, Mr. Bundy,
that's the bathroom.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.318
That's all right, ma'am.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.398
That's where he makes
all his big decisions.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.388
My name is Bundy...

13:58.600 --> 13:59.828
...Peggy Bundy.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.429
And I would strongly advise you
to learn the lesson...

14:02.640 --> 14:04.949
...that my Uncle Harold
learned the hard way.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.870
If you're wearing a pacemaker,
do not follow him into the bathroom.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.393
- What's your name?
- Kelly.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.874
Oh, you should be in the Ks.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.832
Oh, thank you.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.668
- Name?
- Bundy.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.836
Oh, you should be in the B's.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.190
Oh, thank you.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.793
- Your name?
- Kelly.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.560
Then you should be in the Ks.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.598
They don't want me over there.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.040
- Your name, please.
- Bundy, Bud Bundy.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.840
Is this your first time?

14:46.680 --> 14:48.671
What, are you kidding?

14:48.880 --> 14:52.111
Why does everyone look at me
and just assume I'm a virgin?

14:53.320 --> 14:54.548
Because I'm not.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.149
Could a virgin tell you the name
and last book read...

14:57.360 --> 14:59.954
...by every Playboy centrefold
in the last ten years?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.708
I've been there and back, baby.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.029
I know the female body
like I know my own hand.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.514
I mean, the back of my hand.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.518
" Bud, oh, Bud," they scream.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.119
Why, once, I even took a girl-

15:18.320 --> 15:23.189
Sir, I just meant
is this the first time you're voting?

15:26.320 --> 15:29.551
I guess that's something
I can admit to. Yes, yes it is.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.910
Tell me, where do I go
and what do I do with it?

15:32.160 --> 15:35.516
I bet that isn't the first time
you asked that.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.756
I know what you're doing.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.197
You're trying to tear me down
because you want me.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.875
All girls do that.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.152
I know you're twitching
under your girdle.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.998
Well, dream on, Methuselah.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.671
What's your name?

16:05.880 --> 16:07.916
Oh, honey, it's okay.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.951
Here, take a ballot.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.351
Hell, this is Chicago, take two.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.870
Hey, is it yellow
in everybody's booth?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.952
Oops, never mind,
just had hair in my eyes.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.073
Excuse me.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.477
Sorry, kids, I just have to
ask Daddy a question.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.156
Hey, woman,
what are you doing in here?

16:33.360 --> 16:34.793
This is sacred.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.753
Hey, no, Peg, that's sacred too.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.188
Take me, Al.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.109
Right here with the fate
of democracy in your hands.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.878
<i>And now for the election news.</i>

16:52.120 --> 16:53.997
<i>Good news for those
who think Americans...</i>

16:54.200 --> 16:56.236
<i>...no longer care
about the electoral process.</i>

16:56.440 --> 16:59.398
<i>In the largest turnout
in the last three national elections...</i>

16:59.600 --> 17:05.310
<i>...a full one half of 1 percent of all
registered v oters actually did v ote.</i>

17:05.520 --> 17:07.078
<i>Give 'em hell, America.</i>

17:09.319 --> 17:11.231
<i>Now let's look at some local returns.</i>

17:11.480 --> 17:16.031
<i>The beer tax passed,
25, 000 to 10, 000.</i>

17:16.880 --> 17:18.108
<i>And the closest race...</i>

17:18.319 --> 17:20.709
<i>...the so-called Save the Earth
Clean Air Amendment...</i>

17:20.920 --> 17:23.309
<i>...passed by a v ote of five to four.</i>

17:23.520 --> 17:26.990
<i>And now we're gonna hear
from our president-elect...</i>

17:27.240 --> 17:29.310
<i>...as we tak e you live
to his campaign head...</i>

17:29.520 --> 17:31.112
Incredible. We lost everything.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.754
Not one single thing
we wanted passed.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.871
I guess Bundys don't count.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.513
Or add, nor read.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.632
- Or get a woman.
- Or a man.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.354
What a waste of a day.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.590
It's all Dad's fault.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.510
I mean, he made us part
of the electrical process.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.397
Once again we learned
that we mean nothing.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.234
Well, at least we tried.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.839
And failed as usual.

18:01.080 --> 18:05.710
- Kid's right. Give up. We did.
- No, we can't quit.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.673
- You saying we try again next year?
- No.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.155
Tell you the truth,
I'm never voting again.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.469
Like marriage, no matter
who you choose it turns out bad.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.470
Unless you're rich.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.796
They get everything they want-
Well, fine.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.275
Let them have their birds
and their air and their-

18:23.480 --> 18:25.311
Even their presidents.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.036
But we cared about beer,
and they took it away from us.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.879
Yeah, sure, what do they care if a man
who sells shoes or fixes cars...

18:34.080 --> 18:37.038
...or totes that barge,
or spears that doody in the park...

18:37.240 --> 18:40.277
...has to use his whole pay cheque
to buy one beer?

18:41.320 --> 18:42.799
What do they care?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.992
They're at their outdoor restaurants
eating their little pizzas...

18:46.200 --> 18:50.512
...and drinking some fine wine
in a no-smoking section...

18:50.720 --> 18:54.190
...with their sexy,
skinny second wives...

18:54.400 --> 18:56.868
...while we're breeding
with peasant stock.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.237
No offence, Peg.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.228
One thing I know...

19:02.440 --> 19:05.193
...we're never going to win
through the system.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.789
<i>Voting has never been
the American way.</i>

19:08.000 --> 19:11.959
We didn't get away from
that pansy country England by voting.

19:12.160 --> 19:15.630
We did it by throwing their
stinking tea in our American harbour.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.998
And why?

19:22.280 --> 19:24.919
Because Americans don't like tea.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.268
We like coffee.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.038
And Americans don't like wine.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.468
We like beer.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.069
- Yeah.
- Ice cold.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.875
Ice cold, best in a bottle,
but fine anyway you can get it...

19:38.080 --> 19:41.516
...belching, burping,
wake-up-in-a-pool-of-it beer.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.716
So let's show them
how a beer man votes.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.990
Let's get blitzed
and take it to the streets.

19:49.200 --> 19:54.228
Let's strike a blow
anywhere they dine alfresco...

19:54.560 --> 19:56.869
...anywhere they eat Brie cheese...

19:57.080 --> 20:00.117
...and anywhere they wear their pants
up high around their waist...

20:00.320 --> 20:02.231
...in the European way.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.077
The only thing
that Americans understand...

20:06.280 --> 20:09.829
<i>...is mindless Tom and Jerry
cartoon-like violence.</i>

20:10.720 --> 20:14.633
So let's go kick some elite butt.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.791
Give me beer, or give me death!

20:30.200 --> 20:31.792
Or both.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.836
Let's pillage.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.996
<i>And in the biggest
election-related story...</i>

20:51.400 --> 20:54.073
<i>...people are being urged to eat
at home, or at a rib joint.</i>

20:54.280 --> 20:58.990
<i>Whatever you do, stay away from any
restaurant that starts with "Chez. "</i>

20:59.200 --> 21:03.796
<i>Frenchmen, as if they had to be told,
should stay at home.</i>

21:04.000 --> 21:08.073
<i>An angry mob led by
a balding madman screaming.:</i>

21:08.280 --> 21:11.511
<i>"I sell shoes, damn it,
and I'm stinking drunk"...</i>

21:11.720 --> 21:17.192
<i>...has run amuck, and they've turned
the streets white with foam.</i>

21:18.400 --> 21:20.356
<i>Beer forever.</i>

21:22.480 --> 21:25.631
<i>Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.</i>

21:26.080 --> 21:30.631
<i>Anyway, the 2 percent beer tax
that was overwhelmingly v oted in...</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:34.037
<i>...is being reconsidered
in a special midnight session...</i>

21:34.240 --> 21:36.549
<i>...of a cowering city council.</i>

21:40.040 --> 21:41.917
Well...

21:45.880 --> 21:49.190
...it looks like the little man
finally might have won one.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.879
You know, it's amazing...

21:51.080 --> 21:54.390
...I feel more like an American now
than ever before.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.990
By the way, does anyone know
who was elected president?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.877
What's the difference?

22:01.440 --> 22:03.431
But whoever you are...

22:03.640 --> 22:05.870
...read my lips.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.713
Don't tax beer.
