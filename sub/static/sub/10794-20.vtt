WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:05.639
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.673 --> 00:09.143
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.177 --> 00:12.012
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.046 --> 00:13.681
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.714 --> 00:17.051
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.085 --> 00:20.221
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.756
You are a good commander.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.193
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.061
RUSH: It was never
 about going home,

00:27.095 --> 00:28.662
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.100
That is the mission.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.901
Well, I've just completed
 a thorough diagnostic

00:33.934 --> 00:35.869
on one of the stasis pods.

00:35.903 --> 00:36.937
Very informative.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.939
We've been
 searching what we were

00:38.972 --> 00:41.109
able to transfer
 from the archive.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.344
The ALS cure
 wasn't in there.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.413
JOHANSEN:
 The first symptoms presented

00:45.446 --> 00:47.381
five years after
 we arrived on the planet.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.283
I died a few years
 after that.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.318
SCOTT: We've got drones,
 dead ahead.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.953
YOUNG: The drones
 cannot track us,

00:52.986 --> 00:55.123
so instead, they've
 blockaded the stars from
 which Destiny recharges.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.291
ELI: This could be it,
 the end of the line.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.960
PARK: There's new
 hybrids in the dome
 we could lose forever.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.962
The hydroponic
 dome's been breached.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.965
Flash blindness.
 Hopefully it's temporary.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.734
I can't see!

01:10.003 --> 01:12.106
How you feeling?
 Oh. Great.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.808
I haven't had
 this much rest in weeks.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.477
I never thought I'd say this,
 but I'm actually
 looking forward

01:16.510 --> 01:17.811
to getting bleary-eyed
 analyzing data.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.682
Well, let's see
where we're at.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.153
I've been seeing
 occasional flashes of light.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.787
I think that's
 a good sign, right?

01:28.356 --> 01:30.358
Okay. Open your eyes.

01:35.963 --> 01:36.964
Lisa?

01:39.133 --> 01:42.035
It's still dark.
 I can't see.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.842
Anything?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.146
No.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.048
(CRYING)

02:08.862 --> 02:10.298
Colonel,
 you got a second?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.465
Can it wait?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.501
You look terrible.
 Thank you.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.869
You're running
 yourself ragged, okay?
 Get some rest.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.505
Way ahead of you.
 That's where I'm going.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.539
(ON RADIO) Colonel Young,
 this is Rush. Come in.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.309
Ignore that.
 You're no good
 to us exhausted.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.976
Colonel Young?

02:23.010 --> 02:24.545
This is Young.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.880
Could you join us
 in the Control
 Interface Room, please?

02:26.914 --> 02:28.916
We've something we
 want to show you.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.286
We did it.
 Fantastic.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.387
What'd they do?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.289
I have no idea.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.958
We found a way to track
 the command ships that
 control the drones.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.227
How?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
We managed to isolate
 the subspace signals

02:41.262 --> 02:42.996
they use to communicate
with each other.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.065
Then we plugged
 the data

02:45.098 --> 02:48.068
into Destiny's
 long-range sensors,
 and it worked.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.170
WRAY: So we know
 where they are.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.040
Then we can avoid them
 and find safe planets
 to resupply.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.175
That was the idea, anyway.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.279
Let's see it.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.253
This is the path
 that the seed ships
 plotted for us

03:05.286 --> 03:08.256
through this galaxy.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.358
These are
 the upcoming gates,

03:12.260 --> 03:14.928
and these are
 the command ships.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.430
Oh, my God.

03:16.464 --> 03:19.066
Look, we've pushed this
as far as sensor
capability will allow,

03:19.099 --> 03:20.601
and the results
are the same.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.936
As far as we can tell,

03:22.970 --> 03:25.138
they're waiting
at every gate between here
and the edge of the galaxy.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.443
We're screwed.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.864
Colonel Young?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
No, I'm Rush,
 this is Young.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.368
Colonel Telford's
 waiting for you.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.036
You sure your
 sensor data is accurate?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.138
Of course it is.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.940
And they're at
 every single gate?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.909
Well, they've
figured out
how we operate.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.477
They know
 which stars we use
 to recharge,

04:03.511 --> 04:05.646
they know that we use
 the gate to resupply.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.014
They're everywhere
 we want to be
 along that path.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.083
So go off the path.
 Use the shuttles
 and check out ungated worlds.

04:10.117 --> 04:14.455
We can't do that.
 There's over 300 billion stars
 in that galaxy.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.156
Only a small
 percentage of them
 have planets.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.527
An even smaller percentage
 are capable of
 sustaining life.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.130
The seed ships
 did the legwork.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.333
They found
 the needles in the haystack.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.301
If we go off on our own,
 it could be months,

04:27.335 --> 04:31.505
maybe even years,
 between viable worlds.
 It's not an option.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.441
What's your
 supply situation?

04:33.474 --> 04:36.176
We're looking at about
 a month's worth
 of food and water.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.611
What about power?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.513
We'll die of thirst
 before that becomes
 an issue.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.949
We could really use
 a supply line
 from home, David.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.183
Well, the only planet
 we know of

04:43.216 --> 04:44.418
with the power
 requirements to reach you

04:44.452 --> 04:45.519
is still refusing to help.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.322
Woolsey is still
 pushing diplomacy,

04:48.356 --> 04:50.023
but he's not
making much progress.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.326
Whatever the solution is

04:52.360 --> 04:54.127
you're gonna have
to make it happen
on your own.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.471
Hey. I'm collecting
 inventory reports.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.272
Guess it could be a while
 before we can
 use the gate again.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.641
So I hear.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.911
We're actually in
 pretty good shape
 down here for the moment.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.917
Matt told me about Lisa.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
Do you think her
 condition's permanent?

05:20.488 --> 05:21.955
I don't know. I mean,

05:21.989 --> 05:23.657
there should have been
 some progress by now.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.127
It's not your fault.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
You don't have
 the right equipment,
 the resources...

05:29.196 --> 05:30.564
Even if I did,
 it wouldn't make
 a difference.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.667
There's no treatment.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.470
Her corneas were burned
 by ultraviolet radiation.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.439
If they don't heal
 on their own...

05:40.240 --> 05:41.475
Well, I know
 it seems unfair,

05:41.509 --> 05:44.945
but sometimes you just
have to play the hand
that you're dealt.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.718
Why do I get the feeling
 you're not just
 talking about Lisa?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.055
There's still hope.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.957
For her and for you.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.993
(SNIFFLES)

06:00.027 --> 06:03.296
ALS is a death sentence,
 Chloe, you know that,

06:04.765 --> 06:07.334
and it's not
 gonna be pretty.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.103
It'll start with
 muscle weakness and cramping.

06:12.039 --> 06:16.610
Then I'll have
 trouble walking, talking,
 feeding myself,

06:18.311 --> 06:22.182
and eventually,
 full paralysis will set in,

06:22.215 --> 06:24.084
but my mind
 will be unaffected.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.623
I'll be a prisoner
 trapped inside my own body.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.059
Like I said,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
you play
 the hand you're dealt.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.399
So, no help from home.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.368
No.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.303
Well, that doesn't
 leave us with
 many options.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.372
Well, we can't run,
 we can't hide,
 we'll have to fight.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.240
There's a lot of them
 out there.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.076
RUSH: We don't have
to take on all of them.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.245
Just as many as we have to
 in order to resupply
 when necessary.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.114
That's still
 a pretty tall order

06:54.147 --> 06:56.083
considering
we've only taken out
one of their command ships.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.251
And that was
 with help.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.687
Well, we do have
 the element of surprise
 now we're able to track them.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.091
Okay,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.560
we choose a target,
drop out of FTL,

07:06.594 --> 07:08.729
and open fire
 before it's got
 a chance to respond.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.131
But what if it does
 manage a response?

07:11.164 --> 07:13.166
Well, if we don't
destroy it immediately,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.402
we can at least
 cause enough damage
 to gain a huge advantage.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.071
So, let's say
 this works once,
 maybe even twice,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.406
but we're going to
 start taking damage,

07:19.439 --> 07:22.409
and it's going
 to take its toll.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.345
Well, we find a way
 to minimize that damage.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.715
Yeah? And I suppose
 you've got an idea
 on how we manage that.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.217
As a matter of fact,

07:31.351 --> 07:32.653
I do.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.794
So you're saying
we dial up the shields?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.195
Well, no, not exactly.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.364
It's more like
 we tune them.

07:44.397 --> 07:48.301
When we're in battle,
 the shields continuously cycle
 through various frequencies

07:48.335 --> 07:51.204
in the hopes of matching
 incoming energy-based attacks.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.507
The closer the match,
 the easier
 the attack is to absorb

07:53.541 --> 07:55.509
and, consequently,
 the less damage we take.

07:55.543 --> 07:59.346
It's a guessing game,
like rock, paper, scissors.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.381
But in the case of the drones,
 we don't have to guess.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.385
Thanks to
 someone's brilliant idea
 to bring one onboard.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.221
The energy signature
 of their weapons
 is a fairly limited range.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.890
We can target
 specifically for it.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.293
We just need to override
 Destiny's normal
 randomized shield pattern.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.463
And paper covers
 rock every time.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.566
If all Destiny has to do
 is find the right match,

08:18.599 --> 08:20.634
why does it bother cycling
 in the first place?

08:20.668 --> 08:23.403
Because matching
 and maintaining
 a single specific pattern

08:23.436 --> 08:26.206
makes it vulnerable
 to all other forms of attack.

08:26.239 --> 08:31.211
Right,
 like if they throw scissors,
 and we're guessing rock.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.746
Not to push
the analogy too far.
 Too late.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.582
So if we are wrong,
 it would be like we have
 no shields at all?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.217
We're not wrong.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.427
Main weapon is
charged and ready.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.497
Rush, what's your status?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.500
Looks like Destiny's
accepting our override.
Shields are at maximum.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.636
Modulation is limited
 within target range.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.713
Who calculated
 the FTL jump?

09:05.746 --> 09:06.780
Chloe.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.281
Think we'll come out
 in range?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.283
Well, it's a bit like
 trying to hit a dime

09:10.317 --> 09:11.685
with a bullet
 from 1,000 yards,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.420
but she's pretty good.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.796
(ALARM BLARING)

09:22.830 --> 09:24.231
What is that?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.232
Collision alarms.
 We're about to hit!

09:25.265 --> 09:25.833
Hold on!

09:42.249 --> 09:43.617
(EXHALING)

09:43.651 --> 09:45.485
I take it back,
 she is very, very good.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.687
We've got incoming.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.328
It's working.
 Their weapons are
 having almost no effect.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.496
Concentrate on
the command ship.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.631
Ignore the drones.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.832
I don't have a shot!

09:58.866 --> 09:59.867
Working on it.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.445
The command ship is damaged,
 but still operational.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.347
Bringing us around again.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.518
(ALARM BEEPING)

10:18.551 --> 10:19.653
YOUNG: What's that?

10:19.687 --> 10:20.453
The shields
 just dropped 10%.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.726
What's going on?
All of a sudden their shots
are getting through!

10:27.728 --> 10:28.796
That's not weapons fire.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.610
It's the drones.
 They're flying right into us.
 It's a kamikaze run!

10:43.643 --> 10:45.478
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

10:45.512 --> 10:46.379
Shields are down to
 half and still dropping.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.315
We've lost power
 in multiple sections.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.350
I'm down three gun positions.
 I can't hold them off.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.685
Forget it,
 there's too many, anyway!

10:51.719 --> 10:53.687
Just give me another crack
 at that command ship.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.522
She's trying to
 outmaneuver us.
 I need some more time.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.824
We don't have it.
 Shields are failing.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.270
Almost there.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.673
We got them.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.685
Direct hit.
 The command ship's
 been destroyed.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.054
Looks like the drones
 have gone dormant.
 (BEEPING STOPS)

11:27.087 --> 11:29.923
Away teams to the shuttles,
let's make this quick.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.559
We don't want to stay here
any longer than we have to.
Go.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.534
We can't do this
 every time we
 need to resupply.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.636
No. We need
 another plan.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.912
Second shuttle just docked.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.346
I guess they found
 a few edibles,

11:53.380 --> 11:54.114
but the pickings
 were pretty slim.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.883
Get us out of here.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.059
Colonel, do you
 have a minute?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.128
Well, I know it sounds
like a crazy idea, Eli,

12:08.161 --> 12:09.963
but I was actually thinking
of getting some sleep,

12:09.997 --> 12:11.698
so unless you have
 some genius idea

12:11.731 --> 12:13.633
that solves all
our problems...

12:13.666 --> 12:15.368
As a matter
 of fact, I do,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.637
but you're not
 gonna like it.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.806
Well,
that goes without saying.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.341
I am notoriously
 hard to please,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.444
so let's hear it.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.645
Okay.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.916
Another day, another galaxy.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.752
What the hell
 does that mean?

12:32.786 --> 12:36.123
This is just one
of 1,000 galaxies
in Destiny path,

12:36.156 --> 12:37.490
and I think you'll agree
 it's turned out to be

12:37.524 --> 12:38.658
something of
 a hostile environment.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.060
So?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.929
So, we skip it.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.933
One continuous FTL jump

12:45.966 --> 12:48.435
out and around
 the length of this galaxy,

12:48.468 --> 12:49.536
across the gap
 to the next one,

12:49.569 --> 12:51.504
until we've reached
the first gate
on the other side.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.141
How long's that going to take?

12:54.174 --> 12:57.978
That's the part
 you're not gonna like.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.481
We're only about
 a third of the way
 through this galaxy,

13:01.514 --> 13:04.517
plus the gap to the next one
 is quite a bit larger
 than last time.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.854
On top of that, thanks
to the ass-kicking that
was just handed to us,

13:06.887 --> 13:08.755
we've got power issues,

13:08.788 --> 13:11.791
and some not insignificant
 damage to the FTL drive

13:11.825 --> 13:13.593
that we won't have
 time to fix,

13:13.626 --> 13:15.628
which means we'll be
operating at reduced speed,

13:15.662 --> 13:16.529
which means we might
 actually run out of...

13:16.563 --> 13:17.664
Eli!

13:17.697 --> 13:19.199
How long?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.668
Three years,
 give or take.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.437
(CHUCKLES)

13:24.471 --> 13:25.873
Three years?

13:25.906 --> 13:27.875
We barely have
 enough for a month.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.177
What do you suggest
 we do for food and water
 while all this is happening?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.078
Nothing.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.016
That's the genius part,
by the way.

13:40.854 --> 13:44.057
Once you're sealed
 inside the stasis pod,
 your metabolism shuts down.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.792
You don't need food or water.
 Basically,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.061
you just sleep through
 the whole thing.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.630
And we've found
several other corridors
like this one.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.732
There should be
 enough for everybody.

13:52.765 --> 13:56.870
And thanks to the research
 that Brody and I
 have already done,

13:56.904 --> 13:58.571
we know they work.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.973
Three years.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.074
Give or take.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.475
You keep saying that.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.912
RUSH: What Eli is
 neglecting to mention

14:04.945 --> 14:07.080
is that a jump like this
 is going to require

14:07.114 --> 14:09.149
every last ounce
 of power we have,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.484
and if his calculations
are off...

14:11.518 --> 14:12.585
They're not.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.653
And we fall short
 even by a fraction,

14:13.686 --> 14:14.754
a tenth of one percent...

14:14.787 --> 14:16.189
We won't.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.758
Then we're going to drift
 the rest of the way,

14:18.791 --> 14:20.560
and instead of three years,

14:20.593 --> 14:23.596
it'll take 1,000 or more.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.032
I assume you were going to
 get to that part.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.070
Look, I've run the numbers.
This could work.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.571
But we have to
 do it soon.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.606
We're bleeding power
 from a dozen systems,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.775
and we can't risk
dropping out to recharge...

14:35.808 --> 14:38.745
Too many things
 that could go wrong.
 We have to find another way.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.615
All right, uh...

14:42.649 --> 14:45.085
How long would it take you
 to prep the rest
 of these pods?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.819
A day, maybe.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.788
Get to work.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.028
Colonel...
You've got 24 hours

14:55.062 --> 14:56.829
to come up
with a better idea.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.134
WRAY: Three years?

15:01.168 --> 15:04.104
Yeah, that's in
 a best-case scenario.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.139
(SIGHS) The thought
of being sealed

15:06.173 --> 15:08.208
in one of those things
 for so long,

15:08.241 --> 15:09.977
it kind of creeps me out.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.211
I don't like it much,
 either,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.913
but we're quickly
running out of options.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.748
Well, if we're
 going to do this,

15:15.782 --> 15:19.086
I recommend that
 everyone be permitted
 a final visit to Earth.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.920
Say their goodbyes.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.922
All right,
 you make the arrangements,

15:22.956 --> 15:24.724
but it's gonna have to
be pretty quick.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.893
We pretty much have to
 shut down everything
 to make this work,

15:26.926 --> 15:30.030
and if we take too long,
 we're going to
 run out of power.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.849
(SIGHS) Bollocks.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.654
CHLOE: How's it going?

15:54.687 --> 15:55.688
Huh?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.228
It's not.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.166
For what it's worth,
 I went over Eli's numbers.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.767
It's true there's not
 much margin for error,

16:07.800 --> 16:08.935
but I think
 it might just work.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.004
Yeah, if we're lucky.

16:11.038 --> 16:14.307
Desti is on this path
 for a reason.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.043
We've only strayed
 from it once,

16:16.076 --> 16:17.877
and that's what caused
 all this trouble
 in the first place.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.047
But we're not
going off the path.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.315
At least not for good.
 We're just skipping
 part of it.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.717
Yeah, but that's
 what bothers me.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.054
This ship was launched
 to solve a mystery,

16:27.087 --> 16:30.057
not by arriving
 at some ultimate destination

16:30.090 --> 16:32.359
where all the questions
 are answered at one time,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.695
but by accumulating
 knowledge bit by bit.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.030
We skip over this galaxy,

16:37.064 --> 16:38.631
then who's to say
 we won't skip over

16:38.665 --> 16:40.633
some vital
 piece of the puzzle,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.769
and then all of this,
 everything we've been through

16:44.003 --> 16:44.937
will be for nothing.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.175
There's got to be
 a way to defeat them.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.342
I just need more time.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.212
Which we don't
 have. Look,

16:52.245 --> 16:55.882
you're right,
 if we go into those pods,
 we're taking a chance.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.017
We might miss something

16:58.051 --> 16:59.919
or we might sleep
 a lot longer than we planned,

16:59.952 --> 17:01.854
and never see
 our loved ones again.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.424
Or we might never
wake up at all,

17:04.457 --> 17:07.194
but Destiny will keep going.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.262
If we stay, and we don't find
 a way to defeat the drones,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.098
we'll all be killed,

17:11.131 --> 17:13.400
and this ship
will be destroyed,

17:13.433 --> 17:16.403
and then this really will have
 all been for nothing.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.076
(ON RADIO) Colonel,
 this is Brody.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.778
We're ready to put
 the first group into stasis.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.721
Please just step
 into your assigned pods.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.823
Don't worry,
 I'll be monitoring
 your progress.

17:43.996 --> 17:44.997
See you soon.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.834
Soon.

18:11.023 --> 18:11.958
It's me, Mom.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.196
Eli.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.299
I don't have much time.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.703
Just long enough
to say goodbye.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.241
We've got smart people
 working on it.

18:28.275 --> 18:33.246
Really smart,
 but still, three years.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.114
Even if it all goes well,

18:36.183 --> 18:38.285
three years at least.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.420
I'm sorry.
 No, no, Eli...

18:40.453 --> 18:43.856
I can't help thinking
 that if I had made
 different choices in my life,

18:43.890 --> 18:45.258
you wouldn't be
 alone right now.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.327
If you had made
 different choices,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.197
you wouldn't have seen
 the incredible
 sights you've seen,

18:50.230 --> 18:53.466
done the amazing
things you've done.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.203
I feel like
 I've abandoned you.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.137
You haven't abandoned me.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.874
You're living your life.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.043
I mean, it was hard
when I didn't...

19:04.076 --> 19:07.814
When I didn't
know where you were,
or what you were doing,

19:07.847 --> 19:09.982
but now I understand.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.487
You don't have to
 be here, Eli.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.090
I just need to know.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.761
Are you happy?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.931
In spite of everything?

19:26.065 --> 19:29.369
Yeah. I am.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.373
That's good enough for me.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.056
Volker.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.090
Yeah.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.225
You on the bridge?

19:52.259 --> 19:53.426
Yeah.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.028
Good, I need you
 to run a diagnostic for me.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.442
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

20:10.410 --> 20:11.544
(SIGHS)

20:12.312 --> 20:13.446
Come in!

20:18.084 --> 20:19.085
What?

20:21.321 --> 20:24.857
Well, as you know,
 we've been powering up
 all the stasis pod corridors,

20:24.891 --> 20:26.459
and it's been...

20:26.493 --> 20:28.895
It's been going pretty well
 up until now.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.497
But...
 What is it?

20:31.964 --> 20:34.033
It's the last section.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.268
It must have
 taken some damage,

20:35.302 --> 20:38.438
possibly even before
 we came onboard the ship.

20:38.471 --> 20:42.942
We can't bring
 those pods online, so...

20:46.178 --> 20:48.180
We're not going to have
 enough for everyone.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.992
The damaged pods
 put us eight short
 of the total we need.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.260
What's the problem?

21:01.294 --> 21:04.063
Well, the ship's very old,
 that's the problem.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
All right,
 we'll try that again.
 Can we fix it?

21:06.299 --> 21:09.302
Not with the material
 we have onboard.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.137
We need something
 called palladium hydride.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.173
It's a component of
 the high-temperature
 superconductors

21:14.206 --> 21:15.575
that are critical
 to the pod systems.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.076
Where do we get
 this stuff?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.346
In ores in alloy
 with other metals,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.080
ideally on planets
 in systems

21:21.113 --> 21:23.115
that have seen substantial
 meteorite activity.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.451
Right, now, we do have
 a possible candidate,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.519
and it's locked out
 for good reason.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.956
The meteorites
 would make the place
 dangerous if not toxic,

21:29.989 --> 21:33.192
but there is still
 a command ship in the system.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.195
They know nothing
 about human physiology

21:36.228 --> 21:40.199
or what makes a planet viable.
 They just know there's a gate.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.969
We can still get
around the lock-out,
if we want to.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.605
Can we survive
 another fight?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.007
Even if we did,
 we'd use up
 far too much power.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.009
The ship would
 never make the jump
 to the next galaxy,

21:50.042 --> 21:51.210
which kind of defeats
 the purpose

21:51.243 --> 21:52.545
of going to this planet
 in the first place.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.447
So what
are you telling me?

21:54.481 --> 21:56.449
We don't have a choice
 but to leave
 eight people out?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.117
Tell them, "Good luck,

21:58.150 --> 21:59.586
"you've got as long as
 the food and water lasts"?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.154
BRODY: We can't even do that.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.723
The power requirements
 needed to maintain

22:03.756 --> 22:06.292
life support for eight people
 for that long

22:06.325 --> 22:07.627
would make us fall short.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.029
Whoever stays out
 would have to...

22:10.062 --> 22:12.198
Kill themselves, yeah.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.367
RUSH: You have
 no choice, Colonel.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.668
If you want
 Eli's plan to work,

22:15.702 --> 22:18.037
you're going to have to
 come up with eight names.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.242
It just goes
 from bad to worse.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.644
So what's
 Colonel Young decided?

22:24.677 --> 22:26.045
He hasn't yet, but...

22:26.078 --> 22:27.179
Don't even think about it.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.416
What?

22:29.449 --> 22:30.683
Volunteering to be
 one of the eight.
 I know you, Ron.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.254
Maybe I would,
 if it came to it,

22:35.287 --> 22:37.356
but I wouldn't
 ask seven others
 to do it with me,

22:37.390 --> 22:40.026
and I don't think
 Colonel Young would, either.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.696
I mean, the way I see it,
 we all came here together
 and, if need be,

22:43.730 --> 22:44.964
we'll all go out together.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.334
Maybe it won't come to that.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.602
What?

22:49.636 --> 22:51.438
Take me to Colonel Young.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.573
Why? What are
 you thinking?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.744
We need to fall back
 to this section

22:57.777 --> 22:59.746
and seal off
 the surrounding corridors,

22:59.779 --> 23:02.782
shut down life support
 to those areas
 and then re-route power...

23:02.815 --> 23:03.650
Okay, we're here.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.385
Sergeant?

23:06.419 --> 23:09.355
Dr. Park has something
 she'd like to share.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.123
We'll use a decoy.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.192
We drop off one of
 our shuttles unmanned,

23:13.225 --> 23:15.462
a short FTL jump
 from the planet.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.631
Then we set it to broadcast
a powerful subspace burst

23:18.665 --> 23:20.800
mimicking a gate dial-out.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.636
It'll take a lot of power
 and it might damage
 a few systems,

23:23.670 --> 23:26.639
but I'm guessing the shuttle
 doesn't survive
 this plan anyway.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.609
No. The command ship
 will investigate,
 taking the drones with it,

23:29.642 --> 23:31.744
and probably
attack the shuttle,

23:31.778 --> 23:34.113
but in the meantime,
 we take advantage
 of the distraction

23:34.146 --> 23:36.415
to dial in and get
 the palladium hydride.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.651
We can recalibrate
 the shields on the shuttle

23:38.685 --> 23:40.487
just like we did Destiny,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.455
and remote pilot
 an evasive course

23:42.489 --> 23:44.791
that'll make it harder
 for the drones to connect
 with a suicide run.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.726
If we are going to
 sacrifice it anyway,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.228
we can rig the engines
 to go critical.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.597
Ram it straight
 into the command ship,

23:50.630 --> 23:51.764
give them a taste of
 their own medicine.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.166
And we'd still
 have one shuttle left.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.503
All right, I think it sounds
 like a great idea.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.204
Let's do it.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.374
Hey, that's good work,
 Dr. Park.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.622
All right, we're in position.

24:15.655 --> 24:19.492
Rush, this is Young.
 Launch the shuttle.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.371
Subspace link is in place.
 We should be able to
 get shuttle telemetry,

24:32.404 --> 24:34.541
and access the flight controls
 with minimal delay.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.342
YOUNG: Understood.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.477
Get us as far away
 from here as possible.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.487
You know what
 we're looking for, right?

24:48.521 --> 24:49.722
Well, I can identify
 the rocks,

24:49.756 --> 24:51.724
but we can't test
 for concentration.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.661
Our best bet is to bring back
 as much as possible.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.228
If this works,
 we should have enough time

24:56.262 --> 24:58.230
to load up as much
 as the Kino sled can hold.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.532
And what if it doesn't?

25:06.773 --> 25:08.207
Okay.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.776
I think we're good.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.679
Broadcasting the signal now.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.684
Let's hope they take
 the bait.

25:20.452 --> 25:21.788
Come on, come on.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.933
That's it.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.735
The command ship
 just dropped off the screen.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.169
They've got to
 be in hyperspace.
 They're on their way.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.370
Gate Room, this is Young.

25:38.404 --> 25:39.271
Start dialing.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.462
This is Gate Room.
 We have a connection.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.264
Away team is en route.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.233
Start removing
 shuttle engine
 safety protocols.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.668
We're gonna have to
time this overload
to the last second.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.677
We got anything?

26:18.811 --> 26:19.679
Screens are clear.

26:22.348 --> 26:23.916
Oh! Hold on.

26:23.950 --> 26:24.917
Command ship
 just dropped out
 near the shuttle.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.319
They're launching drones.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.487
Rush, you're on.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.691
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.401
Barnes, what's our status
 with the away team?

26:42.434 --> 26:44.937
They found
 several impact craters
 near the gate.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.839
They've already begun
 collecting samples.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.316
Whoa! Watch out.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.317
It's all right, I've got it.
 Stabilizing.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.488
Initiate the overload.

27:02.521 --> 27:03.656
You sure? If it
 can't get close enough...

27:03.690 --> 27:05.457
Just do it!

27:08.360 --> 27:10.663
They're launching more drones.
 The shuttle
 doesn't have much time.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.902
Overload in 10 seconds.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.541
Six,

27:22.574 --> 27:24.443
five,

27:24.476 --> 27:25.311
four...

27:35.387 --> 27:36.989
It's gone,

27:37.023 --> 27:39.025
but it's a pretty safe bet
 more are on the way.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.760
Yeah, we're not going to
 wait around to find out.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.643
Nice work, gentlemen.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.578
You got what you need?

27:59.611 --> 28:01.347
We're good.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.415
Let's get this stuff
 out of here.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.132
You ready to go?

28:21.801 --> 28:25.571
I don't know
 what I'm gonna say.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.775
He doesn't even
 know I'm his father.
 I'm just some guy

28:28.808 --> 28:31.778
who shows up
 every once in a while
 to see how he's doing.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.983
And, how is he doing?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.887
His mom is...

28:40.920 --> 28:44.891
I think she's a good person.
 I just don't think
 she's a good parent.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.692
Folks from Homeworld Command
 tell me

28:46.725 --> 28:48.961
if I was to make
 the phone call,
 they'll step in,

28:48.995 --> 28:50.997
see he's raised
 in a proper home.

28:53.099 --> 28:57.970
Well, I wouldn't
 make any rash decisions.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.973
What about you?
 What are you
 gonna say to Sharon?

29:01.007 --> 29:05.477
Oh, I just got back,
 and I didn't see her.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.513
She's at
 a conference in Brussels.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.982
Not enough time.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.017
Sorry.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.422
You know, (CLEARS THROAT)

29:16.455 --> 29:18.757
you go back
 billions of light-years,

29:20.692 --> 29:22.628
cross an entire universe,

29:22.661 --> 29:25.865
and you're just separated
 by a couple of thousand miles.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.370
Anyway, I got to talk
 to her on the phone.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.374
What'd you say?

29:39.711 --> 29:42.481
I said I was sorry.

29:43.850 --> 29:48.821
That this wasn't
 fair to her anymore,

29:48.855 --> 29:50.857
and she should just move on.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.561
What did she say?

29:57.163 --> 29:58.865
Not much.

29:58.898 --> 29:59.899
She...

30:01.968 --> 30:03.802
She just started crying.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.847
(INAUDIBLE)

31:25.817 --> 31:27.786
Eat up, everybody.
 Except for the canned goods,

31:27.819 --> 31:29.588
this is all going
to waste anyway.

31:29.621 --> 31:33.059
For once, I'm stuffed.
I can't eat another bite.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.227
Mmm. I think I can use
just a little bit more.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.229
WRAY: Oh, yeah?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.932
All right, Colonel,
 how about a toast?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.633
Really?
 Yes.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.636
All right.
All right, why not?

31:44.670 --> 31:50.742
Well, we've been through
 a hell of lot together,
 that's for sure.

31:50.776 --> 31:51.910
I guess it would
 be easy to dwell

31:51.944 --> 31:53.279
on everything
 that we have lost,

31:53.312 --> 31:56.782
but I think today
I would rather think about
what we still have, and

31:56.815 --> 31:58.750
maybe what we've gained.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.987
We're a...
 We're family now,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.555
whether we like it or not.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.858
Sons, daughters, sisters.

32:08.694 --> 32:12.098
Even the slightly crazy uncle
 who, despite everything,

32:12.131 --> 32:14.166
still manages
to come through for you
in the end.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.201
(LAUGHS)

32:18.104 --> 32:19.738
You are

32:19.771 --> 32:23.575
the smartest, bravest,
 most compassionate people

32:23.609 --> 32:26.312
that I have ever had
 the honor to serve with.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.847
To family.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.217
To family.
 To family.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.729
Sweet dreams.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.875
You all right?

32:57.909 --> 32:59.011
Yes, sir.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.985
Well, I guess
you're finally going to
get some sleep.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.355
Three years.
 That should be enough.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.228
Lieutenant, go ahead.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.629
Are you sure?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.765
Yeah. Yeah,
we're going to be fine.

34:00.806 --> 34:04.042
YOUNG: So,
 Rush and Eli are finishing up
 the last of the programming.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.278
They should be done
 by the time I get back.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.679
You're not going
 to go see Emily?

34:07.713 --> 34:08.847
We're done.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.916
Why re-open old wounds?

34:10.949 --> 34:11.949
You know,
 for what it's worth...

34:11.983 --> 34:13.119
David, listen,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.920
my marriage, that was...

34:15.954 --> 34:18.056
That was broken
 a long time ago,

34:18.090 --> 34:20.958
and I have no one
 to blame but myself.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.462
Whatever happens,
we're not giving up on you.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.797
Some of us may have
 a few more gray hairs,
 but we'll still be here.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.302
Good luck, Everett.

34:30.335 --> 34:31.902
Thanks, David.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.741
ELI: How could we
 have missed it?

34:35.774 --> 34:36.908
RUSH: There was no way
 of knowing.

34:36.942 --> 34:37.976
But we ran
 a diagnostic!

34:38.009 --> 34:40.246
And it showed no problems,
 because at that stage,

34:40.279 --> 34:42.447
that particular section
 had yet to be fully engaged.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.815
What's going on?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.117
We repaired the eight pods,

34:45.150 --> 34:47.119
but one of them
was more damaged
than we thought.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.487
It came online
 with the rest of them,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.956
but when we ran final checks,
 it just died.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.859
We might be one short.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.763
Okay, try it now.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.098
(COMPUTER CHIRPING)

35:00.132 --> 35:01.767
It's no use.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.835
Right. Go back down
 to the Control Interface Room

35:03.869 --> 35:05.337
and go through the database.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.307
There's over 1,700 pages
devoted to this system.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.941
You'd better
 get started, then.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.848
Colonel,

35:19.551 --> 35:20.986
we have to talk.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.528
Eli...

35:29.561 --> 35:31.197
Before you ask,
 the answer is, no.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.364
I haven't found any
 magical solutions yet.

35:32.398 --> 35:35.133
It's gonna take time.

35:35.167 --> 35:40.005
According to Rush,
 if two of us go into
 the pods now, today,

35:40.038 --> 35:41.373
the one that stays outside
 could keep

35:41.407 --> 35:43.875
minimal life support going
 for two weeks

35:43.909 --> 35:47.279
before it starts eating
into the power
reserved for the jump.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.114
Sounds about right.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.816
Well, he's... He's
 volunteered to be the one.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.486
You're kidding me.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.121
Really?
 Yeah.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.889
He says he's most
qualified to figure out

35:57.923 --> 35:59.491
what's wrong with
 the pod and then fix it.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.060
I don't know about that.

36:02.093 --> 36:05.464
Yeah, and I don't think
 I can let him do it.
 You know, I think it's...

36:05.497 --> 36:07.098
It's gonna be me.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.369
You're going to fix
 the pod?

36:10.402 --> 36:13.071
I'm obviously not
 going to fix the pod, Eli.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.406
Then you're
 talking about suicide.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.575
I can't trust him.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.477
I can't be sure he's going
 to do the right thing
 when the time comes.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.812
I'll admit he's not perfect,
 but I don't think that...

36:20.846 --> 36:22.248
And what if he
 doesn't find a solution?

36:22.281 --> 36:24.583
What if after two weeks,
 he loses his nerve,

36:24.616 --> 36:26.318
and then he keeps
the life support going,

36:26.352 --> 36:27.786
even for just a few days,
 what happens?

36:29.020 --> 36:32.558
Then we drop out early
 and drift.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.993
And wake up in 1,000 years.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.795
If we wake up at all.
 Right.

36:38.096 --> 36:39.030
It's the only choice.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.201
No, it's not.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.274
I'll do it.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.009
Eli...

36:51.042 --> 36:52.210
If you stay out,
 it's automatic.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.012
You're dead.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.581
If I do it,
 at least I have a chance.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.883
Maybe even
 a better chance than Rush.

36:57.916 --> 37:02.120
For too long,
 I've been content
 to stay in his shadow,

37:02.153 --> 37:05.891
play the part of
 the eager young protege,
 take his orders, but...

37:08.327 --> 37:09.995
I'm not afraid
 to say it anymore.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.163
I'm smarter than him.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.934
And all three of us know it.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.136
I can't ask you to do that.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.306
And I can't take no
 for an answer.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.343
Sorry.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.249
(SOFT MUSIC

37:36.121 --> 37:37.188
Hey.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.959
He told me about
the conversation.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.962
Oh. Right.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.597
Awkward.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.633
No, not really.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.602
I knew he wouldn't
 trust me enough
 to let me stay.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.504
You did?
 Well, in case
 you hadn't noticed,

37:52.538 --> 37:54.005
we do have history.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.974
Is that why you volunteered
in the first place?

37:56.007 --> 37:56.875
Because you knew
he wouldn't accept?

37:58.143 --> 37:59.378
What difference
 does it make?

38:02.314 --> 38:03.181
No.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.285
The only thing
 I failed to anticipate was

38:07.319 --> 38:11.357
that you would volunteer
 to take my place.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.325
So, you did want it
to be Young.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.361
I don't want
 anyone to die, Eli.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.429
This isn't even
 my idea, remember?

38:17.463 --> 38:19.698
But you didn't come up
 with a better one.

38:19.731 --> 38:22.668
Not in the allotted time, no.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.135
Which just goes
 to prove my point.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.337
We're going to need you
 on the other side.

38:26.171 --> 38:27.606
Oh,

38:27.639 --> 38:29.541
I'll be there.

38:29.575 --> 38:32.544
You know,
 maybe I haven't said this
 often enough, Eli,

38:32.578 --> 38:34.145
but you do have...

38:37.082 --> 38:39.651
You do have
 tremendous potential.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.520
I'd hate to see you
 throw it all away.

38:41.553 --> 38:42.654
I'm not.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.559
Anyway, what's the point
 of having potential

38:47.593 --> 38:49.428
if you're not going to step up
 when you're really needed?

38:54.232 --> 38:56.334
You've come
 a long way from
 that video-game slacker

38:56.368 --> 38:58.303
I discovered a year ago.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.971
Thanks.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.339
You've been
 pretty consistent.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.627
Colonel.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.696
Mr. Wallace.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.653
You're sure about this,
right?

39:49.488 --> 39:52.591
I've never been
 more sure of anything
 in my life.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.770
You're a good man, Eli.

40:04.803 --> 40:08.039
Now, get this done,
and we'll see you
on the other side.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.475
Right.
 Right.

43:26.371 --> 43:26.872
