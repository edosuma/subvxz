1:15:32.569 --> 1:15:34.071
HE WAS AMAZING ON THE SHOW.

1:15:34.071 --> 1:15:35.972
HE'S AN AMAZING ARTIST.

1:15:35.972 --> 1:15:36.606
I FOLLOWED HIS CAREER AFTER THE

1:15:36.606 --> 1:15:38.642
SHOW

1:15:38.642 --> 1:15:41.244
THE FACT I'M SINGING A SONG THAT

1:15:41.244 --> 1:15:43.280
CAME FROM HIM IS REALLY EXCITED,

1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.148
ESPECIALLY ON "THE VOICE."

1:15:45.148 --> 1:15:46.717
JORDAN SMITH HAS BEEN A HUGE

1:15:46.717 --> 1:15:47.718
INSPIRATION FOR ME ESPECIALLY ON

1:15:47.718 --> 1:15:50.787
THE SHOW

1:15:50.787 --> 1:15:51.455
I REMEMBER BEING ENAMORED BY HIS

1:15:51.455 --> 1:15:53.990
GIFT

1:15:53.990 --> 1:15:55.592
I FEEL LIKE IN A WEIRD COSMIC

1:15:55.592 --> 1:15:56.860
WAY WE'RE CONNECTED.

1:15:56.860 --> 1:15:58.128
HE'S FROM A SMALL TOWN

1:15:58.128 --> 1:16:00.163
I'M FROM A SMALL TOWN.

1:16:00.163 --> 1:16:02.265
I HOPE OUR STORIES END THE SAME.

1:16:02.265 --> 1:16:05.168
I PRAY I MAKE IT TO THE FINALE

1:16:05.168 --> 1:16:09.773

1:16:10.374 --> 1:16:12.809

1:16:12.809 --> 1:16:14.044

1:16:14.044 --> 1:16:15.645
IT'S GOING TO BE EXECUTION

1:16:15.645 --> 1:16:17.247
IT'S ABOUT HITTING THE BIG NOTES

1:16:17.247 --> 1:16:19.883
AND MAKING THEM RING OUT AND

1:16:19.883 --> 1:16:21.084
MAKE AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

1:16:21.084 --> 1:16:24.721
WITH THE AUDIENCE.

1:16:24.721 --> 1:16:26.590
WITH THIS SONG, THAT'S THE KEY

1:16:26.590 --> 1:16:27.991
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR

1:16:27.991 --> 1:16:30.093
BEAUTY TO COME OUT OF ASHES.

1:16:48.879 --> 1:16:51.715
HE CAN SING BROADWAY

1:16:51.715 --> 1:16:52.282

1:16:55.052 --> 1:16:56.119
