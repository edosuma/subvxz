Welcome home, Mr. Krutoff.

You know I wouldn't ask if
there was any other choice.

Good. 12:00 noon.
I'll see you there.

- You, on the other hand--
- What about me?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.365
You're a young wife

33:19.398 --> 33:23.202
If something happened to Bob,
you'd seek the comfort of home.

But if something
didn't happen to Bob--

33:26.338 --> 33:29.641
If, for example,

33:29.675 --> 33:32.344
he's being protected
by the C.I.A.,

33:32.378 --> 33:36.148
you'd be uncomfortable
with prying questions
and want to escape.

Either way--

33:39.718 --> 33:41.853
And he's still alive?

33:41.887 --> 33:43.255
Last I saw him.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.729
We all thought
you were kidnapped.
Let's keep it that way.

Nobody can know
about this meeting, Kim,
not even my wife.

All right.
Now I'm not gonna pretend...

is a walk in the park.

you need me to do.

I heard from your cousin.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.249
He wants you to know
he's doing just fine.

34:10.282 --> 34:13.252
He's strong and fit,
and hopes that you are too.

34:13.285 --> 34:18.457
In fact--
Stop. Molly, they told me
Jonas is dead.

34:21.093 --> 34:23.595
Who did?
My interrogators.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.365
You can't believe them.
They'll tell you anything.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.434
They had details, Molly.

34:28.467 --> 34:33.539
He was hiding on a boat in
Panama. They caught up with him
at a C.I.A. safe house.

34:33.572 --> 34:38.244
Guard! This woman isn't
my aunt. She's been trying
to pass me messages.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.579
He's confused. He doesn't
know what he's talking about!
Just please take her away!

34:40.612 --> 34:43.048
It's from the stress!
I want to talk
to Supervisor Marsh!

34:43.081 --> 34:46.051
Ma'am, step back!
I can't do this anymore.
I'm done.

I'm ready
to cooperate fully.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.594
Why the change of heart?

34:55.627 --> 35:01.099
I don't want to die in prison,
or on the run like Jonas did.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.073
Tell me about the mission
in San-Tomás.
Not here. Not here.

Take me to D.C.

Let me see the faces
of the people who can
guarantee my safety,

35:13.612 --> 35:16.448

whatever you want.

Ma'am, who did you say
you were here to see?

35:22.488 --> 35:25.624
- My husband, Mack Gerhardt.

35:25.657 --> 35:29.094
I'm sorry, but I have
no prisoner listing
under that name.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.998
- When was he transferred?
- Ma'am, no one under that name
has ever been here.

35:33.031 --> 35:35.834
That's ridiculous.
I just saw him yesterday.
It's G-E-R-H-A-R-D-T.

- And your name is?
- Tiffany Gerhardt.

- And you say
you were here yesterday?
- No, I was here yesterday.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.477
I have no record
of your visit...

35:45.511 --> 35:49.114
or your husband ever
being incarcerated here.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.817
Now I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

[ Kim ]
What do I do when
I get inside the bank?

35:59.157 --> 36:01.360
[ Jonas ]
Stay calm
and don't look around.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.630
Act like you've been there
a dozen times before.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.699

Are you a local resident?

36:54.946 --> 36:57.883
No, sir. But I hope to be.

A jewelry store
was robbed recently.
Mind if I see some I.D.?

37:01.720 --> 37:05.023
Well, my face is gonna be
just as black on my I.D.

is African-American.

So what are we looking at here?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.277
- A patch of water.
- It's about 150 feet deep.

Whatever it is,
it shut down the Unit
and put us on the run.
