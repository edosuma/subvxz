WEBVTT

00:01.180 --> 00:03.312
Previously on The Last Man On Earth.

00:03.337 --> 00:06.023
- So you're still gonna go.
- I'm jealous of you, Phil!

00:06.048 --> 00:09.359
You have a real family. I've
got a blob on a computer screen.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.930
It's not people, but, damn, man.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.619
I got to find that out for myself.

00:12.644 --> 00:14.444
I'm coming with you.

00:20.128 --> 00:21.445
Oh, my God.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.413
Hey, Todd.

00:23.688 --> 00:25.215
What's going on?

00:25.317 --> 00:26.516
Uh, nothing in-in fact.

00:26.618 --> 00:28.585
You know, j-just, uh,
taking a little break.

00:28.687 --> 00:31.154
You know, doing a little wall lean.

00:31.707 --> 00:33.557
- What's that smell?
- What smell?

00:33.659 --> 00:36.293
The overwhelming one
currently in the room.

00:36.395 --> 00:38.462
Oh-oh, that-that smell.

00:38.564 --> 00:41.331
Yeah, oh, you know...

00:41.433 --> 00:43.832
Look, Erica, I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:44.738 --> 00:46.236
I farted.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.565
Yeah, this is one of those
weird cases where, you know,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.590
you smelt it but I'm
the one who dealt it.

00:50.692 --> 00:52.940
You know, it was...
It's a real axiom buster.

00:52.965 --> 00:55.060
- Yeah.
- You might want to keep it moving.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.291
You know, 'cause, uh, fart-wise,

00:56.348 --> 00:57.447
I got a real packed house in here.

00:57.549 --> 00:59.549
It's, uh, standing room only, you know?

00:59.651 --> 01:04.053
Got a real, uh, Deuce Bigelow
in the ole staging area.

01:04.155 --> 01:06.356
I-I have a feeling it's gonna
continue throughout the day,

01:06.458 --> 01:08.257
you know, so you might
want to spread the word

01:08.360 --> 01:10.226
to the others to just
stay away from this room.

01:10.328 --> 01:12.128
You know, till I give the all clear.

01:12.230 --> 01:14.464
- Well, good luck with that.
- Don't need luck.

01:14.566 --> 01:17.500
Just time and gravity.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.659
Catch ya later.

01:19.684 --> 01:21.079
Okay.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.973
Ugh, God.

Hey, uh, got you another lemonade, bud.

02:16.561 --> 02:18.194
You did that while you were singing?

02:18.296 --> 02:19.429
Did what?

02:19.531 --> 02:22.165
I'm offering you a refreshing lemonade.

02:22.787 --> 02:24.534
In a root beer can.

02:25.053 --> 02:26.369
With steam coming out of it.

02:26.471 --> 02:29.138
Probably just a packaging mishap.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.275
Mm-hmm. Well, I'm good for right now.

02:32.377 --> 02:34.589
And, you know, I can
always just pull over,

02:34.662 --> 02:36.079
let you pee, if you want.

02:36.181 --> 02:37.380
That's not necessary.

02:37.482 --> 02:39.976
Uh, FYI, don't spoil your appetite,

02:40.001 --> 02:42.362
'cause in an hour or so,
might be able to rustle up

02:42.387 --> 02:44.320
a couple Rolo's for you.

02:44.422 --> 02:47.256
Did Mom and Dad do something
to you when you were little?

02:47.358 --> 02:50.426
I guess, yeah. Ah.

02:57.996 --> 03:00.103
You thinking about it?

03:00.669 --> 03:02.171
Yeah.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.075
What?

03:06.177 --> 03:08.478
I just want to remind you

03:08.580 --> 03:11.047
what you yourself said to me. Okay?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.182
That the chances of
that blob being people

03:13.284 --> 03:15.184
are almost nonexistent.

03:15.286 --> 03:16.788
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

03:16.813 --> 03:19.099
Phil, I'm a scientist, okay?

03:19.366 --> 03:23.426
I know that data doesn't always
provide the desired results.

03:23.528 --> 03:26.095
Okay. Good.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.484
_

04:00.198 --> 04:02.098
Oh, my God.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.338
Oh. Look at that.

04:09.808 --> 04:12.475
Friggin' buttload of
avocado and orange trees.

04:12.577 --> 04:14.243
- We should stop.
- No, no, no.

04:14.345 --> 04:15.639
Come on. Let's go.

04:15.664 --> 04:17.625
Okay. We'll pick 'em up on the way back.

04:17.719 --> 04:20.692
People are going to
go ape dong over this.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.750
- Okay, well...
- Yes.

04:26.157 --> 04:28.324
Oh, my God.

04:28.743 --> 04:30.193
No way.

04:30.295 --> 04:32.295
No way! Look at that!

04:32.483 --> 04:35.770
Mike. Your little machine
was on to something.

04:52.179 --> 04:53.526
Goats!

04:53.551 --> 04:56.529
- Goats.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.554 --> 04:58.033
Oh, my God.

05:24.568 --> 05:25.934
Oh, my God.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.628
Hey, little fellas.
Hey, what's your names?

05:30.970 --> 05:33.350
Oh, my God. Is this crazy?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.441
Yeah, it's amazing.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.176
Look, we gotta keep going,
all right? We're only

05:36.278 --> 05:37.410
five minutes away from the
heat signature. Come on.

05:37.512 --> 05:40.271
Wait. Aren't these your heat signatures?

05:40.318 --> 05:43.483
N-No. No way. Now come on, let's go.

05:43.585 --> 05:46.119
Mike. This is a huge frigging deal.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.420
Okay, in four years,

05:47.522 --> 05:50.257
we've found one cow, one bull, one fish,

05:50.359 --> 05:51.828
and a few friggin' crickets.

05:51.853 --> 05:54.127
Look, I get it, okay?
All right, so we'll just,

05:54.229 --> 05:56.038
we'll come back here
once we get done doing

05:56.064 --> 05:57.363
what we came here to do, all right?

05:57.465 --> 06:00.900
What if they're gone? Huh?
I just go tell the group,

06:01.002 --> 06:03.069
"Oh, yeah, we had a chance to
get you a bunch of, you know,

06:03.171 --> 06:05.745
fresh milk and-and cheese
and yogurt and meat,

06:05.791 --> 06:08.874
but we decided to prioritize
a frigging heat blob."

06:08.976 --> 06:11.010
Phil, these guys aren't going anywhere.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.946
Not leaving these goats, Mike.

06:18.324 --> 06:20.086
Okay, uh, guys.

06:20.188 --> 06:22.274
Look, I-I... I didn't
want to tell you this,

06:22.299 --> 06:24.232
but then I came to the
realization that, well,

06:24.334 --> 06:26.914
you know, it'd be unsafe not to.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.436
This morning,

06:28.538 --> 06:32.540
as I was working, I
came across some, uh...

06:33.216 --> 06:36.116
How do I put this? Some, uh...

06:37.911 --> 06:40.315
murdered corpses hidden in our walls.

06:40.417 --> 06:41.483
- What?
- No.

06:41.585 --> 06:43.962
- Are you messing with us? 
- I-I wish I was.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.221
But that's not it. There-there's
some other stuff back there,

06:46.323 --> 06:48.323
you guys... should come take a look at.

06:48.425 --> 06:50.039
I can't do it. Mm-mm.

06:50.064 --> 06:52.974
Ever since I was a kid, I've
had a fear of being scared.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.496
I don't want to see a
bunch of dead bodies.

06:54.598 --> 06:56.006
- No.
- No. Don't worry.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.333
- I-I took care of that. 
- Well, did you get rid of them?

06:58.435 --> 07:01.436
Well, uh... I did the next best thing.

07:01.841 --> 07:03.271
Ta-da.

07:03.373 --> 07:05.206
Oh, what the hell?

07:05.309 --> 07:07.630
Well, you know, I thought
this would make it less scary.

07:07.655 --> 07:08.831
You know? The-the trick is,

07:08.856 --> 07:11.112
don't think of 'em as
dead bodies, you know?

07:11.214 --> 07:14.249
Think of 'em as, uh, people.

07:14.717 --> 07:15.949
The sequel.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.320
L-Like Teddy here.

07:18.422 --> 07:20.980
I found him with a
noose around his neck,

07:21.027 --> 07:22.257
hanging from a rafter.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.326
Now he's playing horseshoes,

07:24.428 --> 07:27.128
and the son of a gun just got a leaner.

07:27.734 --> 07:30.709
These two I found crammed
into a floorboard together.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.367
And look at 'em now.

07:32.469 --> 07:35.136
They're having a spirited
arm wrestling session.

07:35.238 --> 07:37.946
Still anybody's game,
but my money's on Matthew.

07:38.310 --> 07:40.268
And, finally, we have Jamie.

07:40.637 --> 07:45.246
Found him as a disembodied
head with his eyes gouged out.

07:45.635 --> 07:46.700
Look at him now.

07:46.795 --> 07:48.721
He's got his body back, and he's sliding

07:48.775 --> 07:51.048
down a frickin' rainbow.

07:51.087 --> 07:53.188
Todd, can you just cut the crap

07:53.290 --> 07:55.070
and tell us why we're
standing in the middle

07:55.110 --> 07:57.036
of this Romanian horror film?

07:57.094 --> 07:58.960
Okay. Just, uh, follow me.

07:59.339 --> 08:01.106
Okay, let's just find a boy

08:01.131 --> 08:03.131
and a girl and then we got
ourselves a goat starter kit

08:03.233 --> 08:04.132
and we can go, all right?

08:04.234 --> 08:06.134
Okay, I got a girl right here.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.877
But I can't find one with a penis.

08:07.924 --> 08:09.104
Have you seen a penis?

08:09.206 --> 08:11.306
No, I'm not seeing
any penises over here.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.668
Oh, is that... the one behind you...

08:12.693 --> 08:14.042
Is that a penis strapped on that one?

08:14.144 --> 08:16.244
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah! Right there.

08:16.346 --> 08:17.942
Oh, no, no, no, not a penis.

08:17.967 --> 08:19.381
It's a little clump of goat poop.

08:19.483 --> 08:20.540
You know, it's really weird to me.

08:20.565 --> 08:22.250
I thought you'd be really
good at finding penises,

08:22.352 --> 08:23.418
since you have to search
for yours every time

08:23.520 --> 08:25.153
- you take a leak. 
- Ha-ha!

08:25.255 --> 08:26.321
Very funny. I'll have you know

08:26.423 --> 08:28.356
it's only slightly below below-average.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.091
- Hmm.
- My doctor even said

08:30.193 --> 08:32.950
that, in some countries, my
size wouldn't even be considered

08:32.975 --> 08:34.129
a medical issue, so...

08:34.231 --> 08:36.164
I guess that's why you
sit down to pee, huh?

08:36.265 --> 08:39.501
I do that out of comfort, Mike,
not out of biological necessity.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.169
Calm down. I'm just pushing your button.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.504
Yeah, well, I got a
button for you to push.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.914
Yeah, I hear it's the size of a button.

08:43.938 --> 08:45.073
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I do.

08:45.175 --> 08:46.062
- You want to see it?
- Let me see it.

08:46.089 --> 08:47.075
- Do you want to see it?
- Let's go. Come on.

08:47.100 --> 08:47.835
Yes on the seeing it?

08:47.860 --> 08:48.802
Yes.

08:50.002 --> 08:51.790
Okay, maybe, uh, a little later.

08:51.815 --> 08:54.509
You know, wh-when the...
sun comes out a little more.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.352
I don't know, it's pretty bright, man.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.187
Okay. Yeah. No, no,
no, right now's great.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.221
- Yeah.
- Right now works for me.

09:00.323 --> 09:02.056
- Give me one second.
- All right.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.597
There you go.

09:05.595 --> 09:06.630
Oh, there's a penis.

09:07.197 --> 09:09.150
- Oh, right here?
- Boom. Yeah, right?

09:09.199 --> 09:11.132
Guy's... there it is.

09:11.234 --> 09:12.300
- Just grab him. He heard us.
- Okay. Right here, right here.

09:12.402 --> 09:13.982
Okay. This is the penis one right here.

09:14.022 --> 09:15.475
- I know, I know, I know.
- Goat penis, goat penis.

09:15.525 --> 09:16.490
- Grab it.
- Come on.

09:19.493 --> 09:22.277
Oh, my God.

09:24.453 --> 09:26.281
What?

09:26.940 --> 09:28.260
Oh, my God.

09:28.285 --> 09:30.351
There's got to be
millions of dollars here.

09:30.454 --> 09:33.254
Yeah. Dollars, pesos, euros,

09:33.356 --> 09:36.291
yen. And there's five
times more down the hallway.

09:37.518 --> 09:39.173
Whatever small business

09:39.198 --> 09:42.096
these homeowners were
running was pretty lucrative.

09:42.351 --> 09:43.991
Is that what I think it is?

09:49.272 --> 09:51.339
Yep. Pure yayo.

09:51.441 --> 09:53.241
Good stuff. Bolivian.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.477
18 bills, farm. 30K, street.

09:55.579 --> 09:58.546
She will take you for a ride,
let you walk on the wind,

09:58.648 --> 10:01.216
then drop you like a bad trust fall.

10:01.756 --> 10:03.418
Why do you know so much about this?

10:03.853 --> 10:07.155
Well, let's just say that
the '80s and Gail Klosterman

10:07.257 --> 10:09.481
had a love-love relationship.

10:09.639 --> 10:10.913
Oh, my God.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.470
Looks almost like the
fake grenade paperweight

10:18.495 --> 10:19.527
in the lounge.

10:26.172 --> 10:29.110
Okay, so you're gonna
turn right just up ahead.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.278
About, um, 50 yards.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.347
Gotcha. Turning right.

10:32.449 --> 10:34.767
Okay, now veer left and
then just head straight.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.417
Veering to the left.

10:36.819 --> 10:38.819
Veer completed.

10:39.089 --> 10:41.356
Heading straight in progress.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.525
And, uh, you should be
coming up to a hill, yeah?

10:43.995 --> 10:46.160
Yeah. Got eyes on the hill.

10:46.263 --> 10:48.263
Great. Okay, so i-it's just
gonna be over this ridge.

10:48.365 --> 10:49.597
Right-right in the valley there.

10:49.699 --> 10:51.599
Oh, hey, a-and go slow, Phil.

10:51.701 --> 10:54.202
All right? W-We don't
want to freak anybody out.

10:54.304 --> 10:56.608
Going a friendly, nonaggressive,

10:56.633 --> 10:59.140
"nice to meet you" 18 miles an hour.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.534
Good, good, good.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.277
Just a little further.

11:02.379 --> 11:04.112
Just about another 50 yards.

11:04.612 --> 11:05.559
Thirty.

11:06.612 --> 11:08.082
Twenty.

11:08.184 --> 11:09.912
Just a little further.

11:11.525 --> 11:14.255
And... stop. Stop.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.892
Sorry, bud.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.259
I know how important this was to you.

11:47.757 --> 11:48.957
Maybe it was the goats.

11:48.992 --> 11:50.625
No.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.661
No, it was right here when we pulled up.

11:55.866 --> 11:57.966
Maybe that machine's on
a time delay or something.

11:58.001 --> 11:59.657
Doesn't work that way.

12:08.578 --> 12:10.645
We should probably head back.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.979
I'm sure they're waiting for us.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.593
No one's waiting for me.

12:25.394 --> 12:27.194
Can you give me a second?

12:29.699 --> 12:31.666
Yeah. Yeah.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.371
How can we tell if it's real?

12:41.396 --> 12:44.403
Okay, everybody just
be very still, okay?

12:44.438 --> 12:48.507
I mean, the-the key
to grenade safety is...

12:48.685 --> 12:51.231
not to explode it, so...

12:55.817 --> 12:57.650
- Todd, stop, stop, stop. 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Dude, dude!

12:57.685 --> 12:58.818
You don't pick it up like that.

12:58.853 --> 13:00.753
I thought the ring was the handle.

13:00.788 --> 13:03.689
That's the jobbie that
explodes it, you dolt.

13:03.724 --> 13:06.157
You know what, I'll do it.

13:07.317 --> 13:09.461
Does that feel real?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.530
Uh, there's only one way to find out.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.776
Oh, my God!

13:24.041 --> 13:25.312
Feels like it was real.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.994
Well, as long as we don't
ever go near that room,

13:28.019 --> 13:29.172
we should be good.

13:29.197 --> 13:30.359
And there's no way they can, like...

13:30.384 --> 13:32.174
I don't know...
activate themselves or...

13:32.199 --> 13:34.319
No. As long as we don't
pull those pins out,

13:34.355 --> 13:35.388
we should be fine.

13:35.423 --> 13:36.999
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.050
Sh-Should be fine.

13:39.075 --> 13:40.585
Okay.

13:41.937 --> 13:44.297
You know what, maybe we
should just do a tiny sweep

13:44.332 --> 13:45.977
of the rest of the house, just in case.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.568
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Just in case.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.710
Let's go.

14:19.701 --> 14:22.568
Hey. Found this in the laundry closet.

14:22.604 --> 14:24.470
Put it in the cocaine pile.

14:24.506 --> 14:27.821
Okay, so that's 75 bags of cocaine,

14:27.846 --> 14:30.948
23 sticks of dynamite, 16 grenades,

14:30.973 --> 14:32.940
82 normal guns,

14:32.965 --> 14:35.051
36 scary guns

14:35.076 --> 14:37.659
and five severed heads.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.394
That's got to be it, right?

14:40.979 --> 14:43.531
Think we've checked just about
everything I can think of.

14:43.826 --> 14:45.132
Well, I could use

14:45.161 --> 14:47.727
a little music to jazz up my mood.

14:47.759 --> 14:49.203
We missed one.

14:49.238 --> 14:51.932
They've put dynamite in the fireplace?

14:51.957 --> 14:53.794
I've had dynamite in
my fireplace before,

14:53.819 --> 14:56.987
and let's just say my chimney
will never be the same again.

15:08.861 --> 15:10.191
Stop!

15:11.034 --> 15:13.271
Did anyone check the piano?

15:13.609 --> 15:14.741
Oh.

15:22.652 --> 15:25.219
Well, that don't look kosher.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.660
I know what you're going through.

15:37.695 --> 15:40.796
Yeah. You wonder what the point is,

15:40.832 --> 15:44.000
why are you still here
when everyone else is gone.

15:44.035 --> 15:46.536
And I-I didn't know
the answer, you know.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.705
Yeah, it got so bad, I-I
didn't want to live anymore.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.874
So I got into my truck,

15:51.910 --> 15:55.545
and I was about to drive it
into a rock and just end it all.

15:55.948 --> 15:56.806
You know?

15:56.866 --> 15:58.786
But then I saw Carol.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.166
I was at my very lowest point.

16:03.655 --> 16:07.490
So, you know, don't give up hope,

16:07.525 --> 16:08.985
'cause one day,

16:09.527 --> 16:11.661
maybe you'll get your answer, too.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.078
Okay?

16:13.965 --> 16:15.731
Hey, look, hey, your answer

16:15.767 --> 16:17.620
might not even be human, you know?

16:17.645 --> 16:18.813
And hear me out.

16:18.838 --> 16:21.573
You know, goats are
living creatures too, okay?

16:21.598 --> 16:24.951
And-and they got something
that, say, sex dolls don't have.

16:24.976 --> 16:28.481
It's, like, a, you know, a
non-plasticity of-of their...

16:28.506 --> 16:30.175
Phil... don't.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.788
In New Zealand, it's
like dating a cousin

16:31.813 --> 16:33.701
- as far as the taboo aspect.
- Phil, please.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.327
Okay, and I'm pretty sure the
goats would be into it. Yeah.

16:36.352 --> 16:39.420
Uh, hey, how bad do you guys
want to have sex with this dude?

16:41.559 --> 16:44.527
You hear that? Oh, you're in, Mike.

16:44.562 --> 16:48.068
Oh, there he is! There's my brother.

16:48.093 --> 16:51.578
The promise of interspecies sex
has brought him back to life.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.608
Ooh, ooh, looks like
they're both into it.

16:55.633 --> 16:57.733
Look, okay, you don't
want to commit just yet.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.501
You probably need to know what
your singing chemistry is like.

17:00.536 --> 17:03.489
Ooh, and I think I
have the perfect song.

17:03.514 --> 17:04.842
Okay, don't look.

17:04.867 --> 17:06.680
I'm gonna surprise you with something.

17:06.704 --> 17:08.575
Okay, all set.

17:08.611 --> 17:13.280
Now we just wait for your
goat lovers to start us out.

17:13.315 --> 17:16.517
Oh, come on. Don't get
stage fright on me now.

Oh, I hope Tandy doesn't mind

Oh, he'll just tear the
head off some other poor dog

18:16.479 --> 18:18.912
and staple it to a toaster or something.

18:19.227 --> 18:22.161
Looks like that thing is
wired to the highest key,

18:22.186 --> 18:24.353
so hit that, and we'll get our answer.

18:26.932 --> 18:28.689
Just made it to the piano.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.291
Initiating protocol.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.293
Always wanted to say that.

18:37.006 --> 18:38.765
Steady, Clancy.

18:38.801 --> 18:40.701
Time to drop the hammer.

18:44.406 --> 18:46.406
Oh, no. That's a B flat.

18:54.104 --> 18:56.316
Here goes nothing.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.342
There she is.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.427
Oh, maybe it's nothing.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.602
Look, it might take a
little while to get used to,

19:15.638 --> 19:17.738
but I think this is gonna
be really good for you.

19:17.773 --> 19:19.540
Yeah, I'm pretty sick of living

19:19.575 --> 19:21.475
in that little tin
box back there anyway.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.577
Do me good to get off the computer

19:23.612 --> 19:26.446
and actually interact
with some human beings.

19:26.741 --> 19:27.714
And you.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.551
Oh, you. Pfft.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.386
Well, I have a feeling you're gonna be

19:32.421 --> 19:34.555
very happy in Zihuatanejo.

19:34.590 --> 19:38.458
Oh, here we are... home sweet...

19:38.494 --> 19:39.760
We're moving.

19:40.181 --> 19:43.103
We're moving.
