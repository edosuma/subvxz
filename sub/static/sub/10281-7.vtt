WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:07.275
Previously on ER:

00:07.308 --> 00:10.444
Morris... you bailing?

00:10.478 --> 00:12.012
Let him walk.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
How do you put it on?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.716
Donning and doffing are
much more complex tasks.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.750
I want my damn arm,
all right?!

00:16.784 --> 00:18.086
I've waited long enough!

00:18.119 --> 00:19.520
Stay away from my patients.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.589
From now on I'll present
to another attending.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.756
He's diabetic.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.092
I didn't know
he had diabetes.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.293
He's a kid.
You're an adult.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.494
You're supposed
to be a doctor.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.129
That patient
brought you flowers?

00:28.162 --> 00:29.497
And a book.
He's a real Civil War buff.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.664
I've been reading it to him.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.200
He's losing his eyesight.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.334
What? You're going
to his house?

00:33.367 --> 00:34.635
He has no one.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.137
He's going blind.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.571
No one should end up
like that.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.452
CHUCK:
You're out of milk.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.122
( sighs )

00:54.155 --> 00:55.423
What day is it?

00:55.456 --> 00:56.690
26th.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.662
What do you want,
front page or sports?

01:01.695 --> 01:04.165
Do you ever realize
that a month's gone by

01:04.197 --> 01:05.498
without your noticing?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.501
Fed's raised rates
again.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.504
And it wasn't
bad, but...

01:10.538 --> 01:12.140
it wasn't
great either?

01:12.140 --> 01:14.142
Half a point. You know,
I should've bought.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.511
( phone rings )

01:17.545 --> 01:18.846
( sighs )

01:18.879 --> 01:20.514
Yes, hello?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.516
This is she.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.518
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
Yeah. See you there.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.621
Okay, thanks. Bye.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.592
Work?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.561
No, my accountant
reminding me

01:33.594 --> 01:35.796
of our appointment
with the IRS today.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.166
I'm getting audited,
which blows,

01:38.166 --> 01:40.534
considering I file 1040EZ.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.203
You don't do long form?

01:42.236 --> 01:44.538
Well, I'm single,
I don't own anything,

01:44.572 --> 01:46.174
I don't have any dependents.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.641
You want some?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.211
What?

01:50.244 --> 01:52.913
Kids-- instant tax writeoff.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.384
Yeah, but...

01:56.417 --> 01:58.586
Come on, baby,
let's do it! Huh?

01:59.587 --> 02:01.689
We like each other, right?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.791
The sex is pretty good.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.361
What are the odds we're gonna
find someone better, huh?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.499
Whose stupid idea was this?!

02:11.532 --> 02:13.401
Weaver says
it's space efficient.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.569
Yeah, takes a bucket
of acetone to erase.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.770
Need a hand with that?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.239
You trying
to be funny?

02:18.272 --> 02:19.607
Nope, just trying to be helpful.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.242
You know what?
Don't bother, Boy Scout.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.676
I just finished your eval.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.612
You may want to practice
these words: Paper or plastic?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.815
Oh, and speaking of negative
evaluations, sign this.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.551
What's this?
It's a documentation of
your chronic tardiness,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.553
your failure to attend
required conferences...

02:32.586 --> 02:34.755
I'm pulling six shifts a week,
how am I supposed to...

02:34.788 --> 02:36.390
...and yelling
at an X-ray tech.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.959
He gave me a lateral C-spine
without T-1.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.794
The repeat took
over three hours.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.663
That's totally unacceptable
and beside the point.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.932
Sign it.
So what, this goes up
to Human Resources now?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.634
Nope. Stays with
me, until I have

02:46.667 --> 02:48.602
a fat enough file
to pull the trigger.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.304
Oh, now you gonna fire me now?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.605
Keep giving me ammo!

02:51.639 --> 02:53.241
Oh, hey!

02:53.274 --> 02:54.642
Uh, electrical malfunction.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
Only on women?
It happens.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.946
I'm telling you,
it's not chicken pox.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.748
Hey!

03:00.781 --> 03:03.817
Teen mom-- news flash--
this is not day care, okay?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.720
Eighty-six the love child and
stop tying up the phone lines.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.689
Yeah, um, listen,
I'm a nurse,
and I'm telling...

03:08.722 --> 03:10.458
Fine. Whatever.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.826
The next time you decide
to put a marker on your face,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.263
can you do it before school
so I can get a sitter?

03:15.263 --> 03:16.497
That means I can stay here?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.432
Only until I can find one.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.768
Now go to the lounge and do
something normal, like homework.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.270
Hey.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.504
Hey.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.538
Don't even.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.643
What's that about?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.612
Overprotective mother.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.980
You still on surgical rotation?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.815
No. I start my ER rotation
today.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.384
Welcome home.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.618
PICKMAN:
Got the whole
family here!

03:37.651 --> 03:40.788
Low speed MVA,
rear-ended, no PSI.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.891
Superficial facial lac on Mom,
sore wrist on the girl

03:43.924 --> 03:45.926
and Dad's only complaint
is about his car.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.695
Six grand in body work, easy.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.430
What about the baby?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.998
Found on the floor, alert,
with no apparent injuries.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.966
No car seat?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.902
Cries whenever he's in it, so
Katie here goes and unhooks him.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.370
Hey, look, we're
all okay here.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.871
Is this all
totally necessary?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.907
The shock of the accident
can often mask injuries.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.343
What are the most
important factors when

04:02.376 --> 04:04.445
triaging children
involved in an MVA?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.314
Proper restraint use.
Glasgow coma scale.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.416
Evaluate consciousness
and spontaneous

04:08.449 --> 04:10.584
movement; in this case,
the baby's a 15.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.486
KOVAC:
Good, Neela.
What?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.054
You know this stuff.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.357
ROMANO:
Hey, Abby, guy over here
needs a foley.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.358
Oh, wait, I'm sorry,
you're playing doctor today?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.827
Okay, never mind.
I'll find a nurse

04:19.860 --> 04:21.629
who's not
kidding herself.
Here's one now.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.797
Mom, right? Uh, there's
good news and bad news.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.699
The bad news is, my
enlarged prostate guy

04:25.733 --> 04:27.701
needs a tube shoved
up his urethra.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.637
The good news is,
he gets to have
you in his pants.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.505
Excuse me?
I absolutely,
positively

04:31.539 --> 04:33.407
have to take my lunch hour
today. I'm being audited.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.943
Didn't know we paid you
enough to get audited.
You don't.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.379
My meeting's at noon,
downtown, so I'll prob...

04:38.412 --> 04:39.713
Great, that is great!

04:39.747 --> 04:41.415
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

04:41.449 --> 04:42.716
LEWIS:
What are you doing?!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.352
Cut the hell out!

04:44.352 --> 04:45.953
What are you doing?
He just grabbed my ass.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.522
Here, take this to church
and have it exorcised.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.424
That's right, you keep walking,
right up to the

04:50.458 --> 04:51.959
Nursing Director's office,
'cause by the time

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
you get there, there'll be
a pink slip waiting for you.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.962
Good! Give me plenty of time

04:54.995 --> 04:57.030
to file
my sexual harassment lawsuit.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.567
Do you mind?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.568
( sighs )

05:00.601 --> 05:02.069
Yes, I do.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.904
You can have it back
at the end of the day

05:03.937 --> 05:04.972
if you learn to behave!

05:05.005 --> 05:06.974
Give me my damn hand back!

05:58.526 --> 05:59.493
Uh, Dove?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.894
Hmm?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.162
That... Is that
the soap you use?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.764
Oh, yeah.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.467
It works, works, works for you.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.801
( chuckling )

06:07.835 --> 06:09.803
You know, they-they say that,

06:09.837 --> 06:13.774
uh, smell is a more powerful
than-than sight...

06:13.807 --> 06:18.446
has a... has a stronger
impact on... on-on memory.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.613
It's true.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.714
Oh.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.584
Gi-Given the choice, I'd...

06:23.617 --> 06:26.887
I'd choose sight.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.991
Could-could do without
smelling... dog poop again.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.826
Or-or stepping in it.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.828
Can I get a vacutainer
with a red top?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.997
Housebreaking not
going so well?

06:37.030 --> 06:39.166
I can do that for you
if you want.
No, I got it.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.634
Now, it's, it's fine.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.837
Um... oh, and-and, uh, thanks.

06:43.871 --> 06:44.838
For what?

06:44.872 --> 06:45.839
Th-The dog.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.575
Oh.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.209
He laughs at all my jokes
and licks my feet.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.211
I think I'm in love.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.481
( both chuckle )

06:53.481 --> 06:56.584
You know, if your didge levels
are in the therapeutic range,

06:56.617 --> 06:58.886
you can stop dragging
yourself down here.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.955
Oh.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.824
Great.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.795
Yeah, just see your primary
physician every three months.

07:07.828 --> 07:12.600
Okay, and we are... done.

07:12.633 --> 07:18.205
Oh. Listen, I, uh,
I make a mean tri-tip.

07:18.238 --> 07:22.175
Seriously, I'm...
I'm quite-quite the chef.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.677
Really?

07:23.711 --> 07:25.713
Yeah. Would...

07:25.746 --> 07:29.850
Would, you know, would you
like to have dinner tonight?

07:29.883 --> 07:33.654
I-I-I'll throw in
a good bottle of wine

07:33.687 --> 07:36.757
if it... if it would
close the deal.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.792
Uh... sure.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.528
What time?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.829
8:00.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.831
All right,
I'll see you then.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.534
A doctor who does
her own blood draws, huh?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.068
Only on friends.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.870
Listen, sorry
about earlier,

07:49.903 --> 07:51.839
but I got a rule
against ass-grabbing.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
It's a good rule.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.075
What'd you do
with it anyway?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.811
I put it where it ought
to be-- under lock and key.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.813
Here. I don't
need the receipt.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.215
Oh, no, I do--
I'm going long form next year.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.953
Hey! What the hell
are you doing here?

08:05.986 --> 08:06.954
Working.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.155
I thought you quit.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.657
Oh, my dad wouldn't let me.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.958
Said he'd pull the money plug

08:10.991 --> 08:12.760
if I didn't see this thing
through.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.562
This "thing" meaning
a career in medicine?

08:14.595 --> 08:15.763
Yeah. You want some?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.297
It's 10:00 in
the morning, man.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.599
( sniffing ):
Hey, you been
smoking weed?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.968
You know, my roommate tokes.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.936
Can't help it
if the smell sticks.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.072
Mmm!

08:25.105 --> 08:27.140
( sighs )

08:29.643 --> 08:31.612
Katie, knock it off!

08:31.645 --> 08:33.881
ERIC:
Sorry about
the mess, Doc.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.183
We're med students actually,
and it's fine, really.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.684
( baby fussing )
Shh...

08:37.717 --> 08:38.986
He likes you.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.821
Colin usually cries
with strangers.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.188
ERIC:
When's he not cry?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.256
Seems like a happy
enough guy to me.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.794
MED STUDENT:
Head sheet, ibuprofen
and Dad's good to go.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.162
Oh, he's not either
of their fathers.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.664
He's my boyfriend.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.999
KOVAC:
Who's next?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.901
Seven-year-old,
no medical history,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.903
ecchymosis of left hand.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.237
Full range of motion,

08:57.270 --> 08:58.806
neurovascularly intact.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.107
X rays are clear.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.943
Um, NSAIDS for pain,
R.I.C.E. and home.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
( baby crying )
KOVAC:
Good. Neela?

09:04.612 --> 09:06.980
21 year old female,
one centimeter forehead lac,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.617
cleared the neck clinically,
remainder of exam normal.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.119
Irrigated the wound,
approximated edges
with dermabond.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.854
Excellent. Abby?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.957
Full term ten-month-old
male, alert and interactive.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.225
He doesn't seem
to be on any...

09:18.258 --> 09:19.760
Start with the...
the vitals.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.996
Afebrile, pulse 118,
resps 24.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.331
No hematoma or step off.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.233
Lungs are clear,
abdomen soft,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.235
moves all extremities, but
since he wasn't restrained,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.671
I'm thinking baby
gram and head CT.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.906
NEELA:
A full body X ray?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.374
He might need
a screening film

09:34.407 --> 09:36.043
since he can't tell
us if anything hurts.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.011
He'd tell us
with irritability and guarding.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.146
Trust your exam, Abby.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.682
No unnecessary X rays,
no CT.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.217
Um, he already got a portable.

09:46.386 --> 09:50.057
Um... finish the discharge
paperwork and send him home.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.026
Dr. Kovac,
I have a UTI in Two.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.196
Maybe you're like me-- better
with babies than with school.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.001
Got into a fight, got stuck
with a shank made out of a fork.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.235
Jimmy, I need to see your eyes.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.370
NEELA:
Can I help?

10:03.403 --> 10:04.772
Stab wound above
the scapula.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.140
Tell me what you do.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.910
ABC's IV, O-2 monitor
and pulse ox.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.879
Mm, that and introduce yourself.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.313
Hi. I'm Neela Rasgotra.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.215
I'm going to listen
to your lungs now.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.752
Okay, head's atraumatic,
TM's fine.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.087
They handcuff
in juvenile hall?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.222
He's 18, in with the
big boys at Joliet

10:22.255 --> 10:23.991
for aggravated
assault and B&E.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.126
Five to ten, but probably
get a few more now.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.029
Clear and equal,
no increased work
of breathing.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.132
Which means the
knife wound hasn't
affected your lungs.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.001
Okay, portable chest
with a lateral neck

10:34.034 --> 10:35.435
and a set of
hematocrits.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.037
Dr. Chen, there's
a call from China

10:37.070 --> 10:38.438
holding on line one
for you.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.373
Huh, wonder what
time it's over there.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.342
Do me a favor: Can you tell
my parents, the cat's fine,

10:42.375 --> 10:44.044
and I'll call them
later at the hotel?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.113
It's not your folks,
it's the embassy.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.684
Um, get him set
up for suturing.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.020
"B&E," that's "breaking
and entering," right?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.287
What did you break into?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.024
My stepfather's house.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.960
He locked me out.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.231
You still here?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.366
Who's, uh...
who's, who's asking?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.101
I'm a nurse.
I saw you earlier.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.739
Oh, I wish... wish
I could say the same.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.174
Have you seen a cabbie
anywhere around here?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.843
I called for one
about an hour ago.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.177
No. I can call another one
for you.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.848
You okay?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.850
Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.953
Blind and getting blinder
every day.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.454
Life is good.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.989
FRANK:
Sam.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.423
I'll call you
another cab, okay?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.192
Got your backup baby-sitter
on line one.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.361
She says she's glad
you called, she's got pinkeye,

11:34.394 --> 11:36.163
wonders: Can you
get her antibiotics?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.364
Great.
50 pounds of pressure

11:37.397 --> 11:39.066
in addition
to being waterproof.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.101
Which makes it perfect
for shucking clams.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.936
What happened to
your other gizmo?

11:42.970 --> 11:44.772
It's being punished
for being naughty.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.206
Enough fun and games.
Where is it?

11:46.239 --> 11:47.775
You got a stay
of execution.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.309
Your audit's been
pushed an hour.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.278
Nothing like postponing
the inevitable.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.246
ROMANO:
Hey, my hand!
cough it up.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.782
At the end of the day, provided

11:54.815 --> 11:56.383
you don't try anything
with that one.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.518
Hey! Do I need to remind you
that I'm in charge here?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.220
You'd have to convince me
first.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.089
Hey, Alex.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.191
What's a prolapsed rectum?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.093
Shouldn't you
be reading

12:06.126 --> 12:08.829
like Harry Potter or something?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.197
You menstruating?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.232
Hey, look a popped-out eyeball!

12:12.265 --> 12:14.034
( Chen speaking Mandarin )

12:14.067 --> 12:16.036
( speaking Mandarin )

12:17.137 --> 12:18.471
Something wrong?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.173
My parents were
in a car accident.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.875
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.911
Happened in some province
north of Suzhou,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.278
I'm not exactly
sure where.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.047
Hey, can you get somebody
to cover for me?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.248
Yeah, of course.
Are you okay?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.216
Not really.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.918
I have to pack

12:30.951 --> 12:32.485
and get my emergency visa.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.421
I don't even know if my
passport's still good.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.056
Do you know any details?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.325
Only that there are no
trauma centers in China.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.132
Something happen?

12:45.165 --> 12:46.266
Yeah, her parents

12:46.299 --> 12:48.268
got hurt in China.
MVA.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.174
Hey, Jing-Mei!

12:54.207 --> 12:56.209
What's going on?
Your folks okay?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.846
I won't know
until I get there.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.113
Is there anything
I can do?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.282
No, I don't think so.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.917
Come here.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.288
Don't worry,
it's gonna be okay.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.359
I got to go.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.031
Jensen's at a conference,
Stewart's on nights

13:18.065 --> 13:19.599
Chen's on emergency leave,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.134
that officially leaves
us short one attending.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.070
Ankle sprain, med refill,
kid with cough.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.304
I'll pick up her slack.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.373
She also had a
dislocated shoulder.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.042
And I'll give any reductions
to residents like you

13:29.076 --> 13:31.044
with two paws
and half a brain.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.545
Elbow contusion,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.314
fight-bite lac. Beat it.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.316
What pleasure could
you possibly get

13:36.349 --> 13:37.584
out of humiliating people?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.219
Fun. You ought
to try it sometime.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.420
All right,
so what'd I miss?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.089
Your calling as a hoodlum.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.224
Here, prison stabbing,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.026
ought to be
right up your alley.

13:46.059 --> 13:49.396
If it's any consolation,
we all suffer at his hand.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.131
What do you got?

13:51.164 --> 13:54.101
Franny Meyers, 34 years old,
brought in by paramedics

13:54.134 --> 13:56.904
with chest pain and
palpitations for an hour.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.538
No cardiac history,
no risk factors.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.040
Hi, Franny,
I'm Dr. Lewis.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.408
Can you tell me
what happened?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.110
Nothing, I felt a little dizzy
at work

14:03.143 --> 14:04.211
and somebody called 911.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.545
I'm fine now.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.214
Orthostatics were good,
and I got an EKG

14:07.247 --> 14:08.248
which was also normal.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.250
Any medications?
Nope.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.318
Are you having
trouble sleeping?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.053
No.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.521
Do you drink
soda, coffee?

14:14.554 --> 14:15.956
Never.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.958
Really? That's amazing.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.226
I skipped breakfast,
that's all.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.593
Listen, I have got to go

14:20.627 --> 14:22.262
pick up my little girl
from pre-school.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.097
No, you're not
going anywhere soon.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.332
When someone comes in
with chest pain

14:25.365 --> 14:27.100
and heart palpitations,

14:27.134 --> 14:28.668
we usually keep them
overnight for observation.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.338
No, my husband can't do
everything, he works, too.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.673
Find her a bed on telemetry
and send out for troponins?
Yeah.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.076
And have Cards
can do a stress test
while she's up here.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.078
I have three kids
and work a full time job--

14:38.111 --> 14:40.113
every day is a stress test.
This is nothing.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.282
Really.
Probably, you're right,
but we need to follow

14:42.315 --> 14:44.151
your labs and monitor
your heart, okay?

14:44.184 --> 14:45.418
Yeah.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.588
You seem to be
doing well.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.491
One on one; I'm not
so hot in a group.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.526
You know,
it gets better.
It always does.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.328
You want to get something
to eat tonight?

14:55.362 --> 14:57.330
Oh, I have a date
sort of.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.032
Chuck?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.068
No. We're at that point
where we should be

15:01.101 --> 15:02.669
spending either
all our time together
or none at all,

15:02.702 --> 15:04.437
and I'm kind of leaning
towards none at all.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.373
So, it's a date
with someone new?

15:06.406 --> 15:08.375
Someone old actually.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.380
Did that guy's head
get cracked by a bat
or something?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.016
Sledge hammer.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
Really?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.319
No, he slipped in the shower,
bumped his head.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.720
He's gonna fine.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.355
Aren't you supposed to be
in the lounge?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.424
Yeah, but mostly
away from you.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.027
I don't know what
my mom's problem is.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.695
I've been in DKA, like,
a thousand times this year.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.331
Wasn't your fault.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.366
I better take you back.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.735
Belly pain prior to
vomiting and diarrhea,

16:08.768 --> 16:10.637
no fever, no history of stones,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.205
urine dip negative.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.540
Might be
the seafood lo mein.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.607
I'm thinking appy.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.109
CBC results?

16:16.143 --> 16:19.112
I didn't order a CBC.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.348
Uh, Dr. Kovac?
You didn't think checking
the white cell count

16:21.381 --> 16:22.382
on a possible appendicitis

16:22.415 --> 16:24.117
would be a good idea?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.418
I told him not to bother.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.054
No guarding, no rebound,
no fever.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.622
CBC is the standard test
used in the diagnosis...

16:29.656 --> 16:31.424
For almost everything,
but it's useless

16:31.458 --> 16:33.660
for anything else except
leukemia, which he doesn't have.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.396
It's also a primary indication
of infection

16:36.429 --> 16:38.231
and I have absolutely
no intention

16:38.265 --> 16:39.532
of proceeding without it.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.402
Fine, then it was 16,000.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.704
You just told me
you didn't order the test.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.207
I forgot to put
the results on chart.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.313
I still think it's
an unconvincing case for appy.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.115
Exactly my point.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.617
Order a CT with triple contrast
to be certain.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.386
Yes, ma'am.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.454
And if you're on a mission
to subvert protocol,

17:01.488 --> 17:05.092
perhaps you should clear it
through administration first.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.593
How on earth do you
stand it down here?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.627
Everybody's so much more
agreeable in Surgery.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.430
Gee, why do you suppose that is?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365
Okay, here's a time-waster.

17:12.398 --> 17:13.833
Transport from Geldin--

17:13.866 --> 17:15.568
stable 12-year-old
heme-onker with fever.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.436
The community hospital
on the East side?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.439
Otherwise known as
a glorified doc-in-the-box.

17:19.472 --> 17:20.839
Who's expendable?
You are.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.575
But since you're
neither fish nor fowl,

17:22.608 --> 17:24.411
you're useless even on
a mindless transport.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.113
Robert...
Dr. Corday,

17:26.113 --> 17:27.114
you forgot to sign
for the factor eight.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.214
Ah, eureka...

17:28.248 --> 17:29.549
our Affirmative Action hero

17:29.582 --> 17:31.551
and our sultry
hand thief.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.820
Go with God,
but more importantly, just go.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.622
My kid's here and I
don't have a sitter.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.390
That's my problem, how?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.259
The nurses can take care
of him in the lounge

17:39.292 --> 17:41.528
until you get back,
right, Chuny?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.563
Sure, no problem.
Fine,
that's settled.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.232
Ebony and ivory can
go off into the sunset

17:45.265 --> 17:46.666
and maybe the rest of us

17:46.699 --> 17:47.667
can get a little work done
around here

17:47.700 --> 17:48.601
without being stared at.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.303
Come on, honey.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.371
I don't think his mom
loved him very much.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.705
Are you on hold?
Yeah, why?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.207
Mrs. Meyers wants
to leave AMA.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.343
Yes, yes, I have an
appointment for today

17:56.376 --> 17:58.245
that I'd like to reschedule.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.612
Mrs. Meyers,

17:59.646 --> 18:02.149
you need to see a doctor
before you go.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.151
I can't find my shoes.
Someone stole my shoes.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.852
Nobody stole your shoes.
They're right there.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.287
I don't know what
I was thinking.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.821
Who's going
to make dinner?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.590
Who's going to feed
the dogs?
Slow down.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.492
Who's going to
wash the clothes?
Slow down.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.826
All right, oh...

18:13.860 --> 18:16.163
She barely has a pulse.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.865
Someone grab
a crash cart!

18:18.898 --> 18:21.334
No, I'm okay.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.336
I'm okay.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.509
Have you been
in prison long?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.344
Few months.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.513
Busted me right after
my girlfriend got me this.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.183
( groans )

18:36.216 --> 18:39.186
Her name's Lila.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.753
She's pretty, too.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.523
Stitches can come out
in ten days.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.891
How's he doing?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.526
Still has some
bony tenderness,

18:46.559 --> 18:47.894
just on his way
to radiology now.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.429
Otherwise,
completely intact.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.697
Come on, lay down.
Need to make a switch.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.699
Hang on, let me
uncuff him.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.202
Let's go.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.636
Ow, easy, man.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.904
Dr. Pratt?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.610
Get her out of here!

19:03.643 --> 19:04.811
Jimmy, it's all right.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.713
Just get her out!
Okay. Go.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.481
Go. Guys give me a
couple of minutes,
all right?

19:08.515 --> 19:09.816
Please.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.222
Want to tell me
what happened?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.589
I'm not a fag,
all right?

19:16.623 --> 19:19.559
Okay.
But you're bleeding pretty bad.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.860
Did they rape you?

19:20.893 --> 19:24.331
Don't come close, okay?
I'm cool.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.832
This is serious.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.935
I said just leave me alone.

19:28.968 --> 19:31.238
Okay, so you're
refusing treatment.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.840
Just know that
you're AMA

19:33.873 --> 19:35.675
and going back to the big house
in about an hour.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.880
Now, you let me do the exam,

19:40.913 --> 19:42.815
you buy yourself
at least a day here.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.619
One more time,
hard as you can.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.954
Anybody seen
Sam's weird little kid?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.422
I can't find him anywhere.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.657
Nope.
( groans in Spanish )

19:50.690 --> 19:52.425
Still SVT.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.993
Am I having
a heart attack?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.628
I don't think so,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.264
but your heart is beating
faster than normal.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.731
No P-waves, narrow QRS.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.267
Has anything like this
ever happen before?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.968
No, I don't
think so.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.470
EKG tech's on his way.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.971
Supraventricular
tachycardia?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.606
Yup, and vagal maneuvers
didn't work.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.707
Adenosine?

20:07.740 --> 20:09.342
Six milligrams.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.344
Mrs. Meyers, we're going
to give you medicine

20:11.378 --> 20:13.480
to try and convert
your heart back to
a normal rhythm.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.382
When we do, we'll be
better able to find out

20:15.415 --> 20:16.749
why this is happening.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.685
All right, I'll be back
to administer it.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.220
Nice assessment.
Thanks.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.723
You never compliment me
like that.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.791
Like what?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.526
"Nice assessment."

20:26.559 --> 20:28.628
I do.
No, you don't.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.464
I don't?
No.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.732
I give you my time,

20:32.765 --> 20:34.501
which is the highest form

20:34.534 --> 20:35.735
of a compliment.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.608
( whirring )

20:43.710 --> 20:46.713
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Shoo.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.016
What's the weirdest thing

20:50.049 --> 20:51.651
you've ever taken
out of somebody's body?

20:51.684 --> 20:53.386
Prednisone for five days

20:53.420 --> 20:55.355
and benadryl for itching,
okay, Mr. McPhee?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.823
Like a real long
tapeworm?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.558
Worse.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.360
Can you get a knee immobilizer
for the LOL in Three?

21:00.393 --> 21:01.661
Yes, Doctor.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.962
A gerbil?

21:02.995 --> 21:05.698
Look, Alex, I really
need to work now.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.534
Go back to the lounge,
okay?

21:08.735 --> 21:11.404
Chuny, the rule-out appy
guy's eating?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.740
Mr. Persky? He's on
his second tray.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.711
Okay, Mr. Persky,
time to go home.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.047
Let me just sign
these discharge papers...

21:21.080 --> 21:23.416
What about the CT
Corday wanted?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.984
He's past the common age
for appy,

21:25.017 --> 21:27.654
he's not getting any sicker
and he's got an appetite.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.456
I thought you said
it was appendicitis.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.624
Not if you can stomach
that much hospital food.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.860
Yeah, but there was
progression of pain,
there was tenderness.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.662
Could be an unusual
presentation.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.464
Sure, once in
a million cases.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.931
Kovac, Radiology
wants you upstairs.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.467
Your tibia fracture lady

21:40.500 --> 21:41.901
is agitated.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.736
Mr. Persky, if you
experience any vomiting,

21:43.770 --> 21:45.638
fever or worsening
belly pain, come back.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.541
Otherwise,
have a nice day.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.809
Where are you going now?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.545
X-ray.
Can I come?

21:52.579 --> 21:56.383
No. The lounge, go.

21:56.416 --> 22:00.086
Hey, Chuny, need you to get me
an attending for a rape exam.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.622
We use the same kit on men
that we do for women, right?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.557
I can do it when I get
back from radiology.

22:04.591 --> 22:05.625
No, thanks.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.827
A guy can get raped?

22:09.962 --> 22:11.964
( sighs )

22:11.998 --> 22:13.466
Dr. Romano, you got a minute?

22:13.500 --> 22:15.101
I've got ten
patients of my own

22:15.134 --> 22:16.636
and six med students I'm
avoiding like the plague,

22:16.669 --> 22:17.804
does it look like
I have a minute?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.038
I need you to do
a rape kit.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.840
Didn't see anything
on the board.

22:20.873 --> 22:21.974
Came in with a knife wound,
he didn't tell us at first.
He?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.710
The prisoner
you gave me earlier.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.144
He has some
rectal bleeding.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.646
Oh. Well, uh...

22:26.679 --> 22:29.449
You go ahead,
I'll sign off on it.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.717
No, per legal,
an attending's

22:30.750 --> 22:32.018
supposed to do
all the rape exams.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.520
It'll be our
little secret.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.754
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.155
You're always
all over me

22:36.188 --> 22:37.724
for this, that and
the other protocol,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.426
and now you want me
to do a procedure...

22:39.426 --> 22:41.428
All of a sudden
you're Mr. By The Book?

22:41.428 --> 22:42.895
This is not a stretch
for you, Pratt.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.797
Just do it,
break the rules.
You're good at it.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.438
A coffee break,
imagine that.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.439
You guys from County?

22:52.439 --> 22:53.606
Yes, sir.

22:53.640 --> 22:54.974
12-year-old with acute
myeloid leukemia,

22:55.007 --> 22:56.543
spiked a fever to 102.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.877
It's probably
just a cold,

22:57.910 --> 22:59.712
but since she's neutropenic,

22:59.746 --> 23:01.981
she needs admission somewhere
till her culture's negative.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.617
You don't have
a pedes floor?
Mm-mm. Budget cuts.

23:04.651 --> 23:05.918
Chest X-ray's clear,

23:05.952 --> 23:08.888
UA's negative,
got two grams of ceftaz.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.990
Her parents here?

23:11.023 --> 23:12.625
Yup, brought her over
from Ann Arbor

23:12.659 --> 23:14.093
for a concert,

23:14.126 --> 23:15.928
celebrate her successful
bone marrow transplant.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.764
Girl started feeling sick
so they drove her

23:17.797 --> 23:20.633
to the nearest hospital,
which was us.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.469
Thought you said
she just had a cold.

23:22.469 --> 23:23.670
I'm Dr. Gallant from County.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.137
She didn't look
like this earlier.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.474
Michelle, can you hear me?

23:27.474 --> 23:28.608
Last vitals were two hours ago.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.676
They said she
was just sleeping.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.977
Give me an oxygen mask.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.845
She was fine,
she was satting at 100%.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.214
Can't get a good pulse ox
through this much nail polish.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.616
No, a pedes mask!

23:36.649 --> 23:37.950
We don't have them.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.986
She should've been
on a monitor.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.021
Mix some ox and gent,
and hang another liter.
She was stable.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.690
Yeah, well, now she's septic.
We need volume.

23:43.723 --> 23:44.791
Here, catch.

23:44.824 --> 23:45.825
Will someone
please tell us

23:45.858 --> 23:47.226
what the hell
is going on?

23:47.259 --> 23:48.828
She might have
a blood infection

23:48.861 --> 23:50.229
and her chemo weakened
her ability to fight it.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.864
Sat's only 81.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.800
Okay, help me get her
onto the gurney.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.167
Gallant...

23:55.201 --> 23:57.036
I need to explain
the risks of transport.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.572
Gallant, I need
to talk to you.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.508
There's a chance of mechanical
problems in the ambulance

24:01.508 --> 24:03.710
or worsening
of her condition.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.679
Now, Doctor.
I need to speak with you.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.648
She's not stable.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.917
You need to stay here
or tube her before we go.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.885
She has a strong pulse,
we have her on O2.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.754
I say we scoop and run.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.055
She only has about
20 minutes before
she stops breathing.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.957
County is 15 tops.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.760
Look, if I can't get her tubed,
there's no backup here, none.

24:21.761 --> 24:22.929
Okay, let's go.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.030
We're going code three.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.665
What does that mean?

24:25.698 --> 24:27.266
That means your
daughter's very sick,

24:27.299 --> 24:28.868
we need to get her
to a trauma center
as soon as we can.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.269
Can we ride with her?
No, not enough room.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.571
We're headed to County.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.672
Gallant, consent.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.806
Sign here.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.712
ABBY:
Well, your heart rate's
back to normal,

24:39.746 --> 24:41.013
which means
the adenosine worked.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.549
Did you get in touch
with your husband?

24:42.549 --> 24:43.983
Yeah. He's picking up the kids.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.052
Well, that's one less thing
for you to do, right?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.554
( sighing ):
Yeah.

24:47.554 --> 24:49.088
You should try
to get some rest.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.958
I can't.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.293
Uh... I lied.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.096
I... I don't sleep
much at all.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.632
Really?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.033
Do you think that's weird?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.301
I don't even know anymore.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.837
I think...

25:04.871 --> 25:06.673
( chair rolling )

25:06.706 --> 25:09.909
I think, with three kids
it's pretty hard to do...

25:09.942 --> 25:11.578
without some help.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.313
Do you have any help?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.815
A nanny?

25:15.848 --> 25:19.051
Uh... ( laughs ) no.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.688
No, I mean... for energy.

25:21.721 --> 25:24.924
Are you taking anything
or drinking anything

25:24.957 --> 25:27.126
to... give you
a little lift?

25:29.361 --> 25:32.298
Because, Franny,
if you are taking something,

25:32.331 --> 25:35.902
it could be doing serious damage
to your heart.

25:46.813 --> 25:50.116
Another mom I know
gives it to me.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.185
It's the only way that
we can get things done.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.091
Uh...

25:59.125 --> 26:01.794
please...

26:01.828 --> 26:04.864
don't tell my husband.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.301
Okay.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.070
I'll be right back.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.241
LEWIS:
Ah... an hour and counting.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.244
Do you think the IRS flagged me
because I worked in two states?

26:18.277 --> 26:19.879
Soccer mom uses
crystal meth.

26:19.912 --> 26:20.880
What?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.181
You heard me.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.050
Did she just tell
you out of the blue?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.652
No, I asked.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.318
Somebody help us!
We were just here.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.187
What happened?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.922
He fell asleep on the way home
and now he won't wake up.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.658
They came in with
an MVA this morning.

26:31.658 --> 26:32.892
They were cleared
and discharged.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.193
Any vomiting?

26:34.226 --> 26:35.695
No, no, but he's-
he's-he's not right.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.763
You must've
missed something.

26:36.796 --> 26:37.897
Okay, come on.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.832
( utensils clattering )

27:03.289 --> 27:05.057
LOCKHART:
Pupils are equal
and sluggish.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.425
RASGOTRA:
He's hypertensive,
110 over 82.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.426
Miller two and
a 4-0 ET tube.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.928
What's going on?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.429
Sir, we're trying
to find out.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.931
Let's get a gram of mannitol
when we're in.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.932
Did he get a CT?

27:12.965 --> 27:13.933
No.

27:13.966 --> 27:14.934
Crichoid...

27:14.967 --> 27:16.402
Heart rate's 69.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.403
Tube.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.805
No CT after an MVA?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.439
He just flew
out of the car seat.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.441
LEWIS:
Okay.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.110
I... I'm in.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.945
Did you check
for a cranial hematoma?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.379
For a step off?

27:27.413 --> 27:28.948
Yes! I checked
for all of that.
He was fine.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.216
Mannitol's running.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.217
What's wrong?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.752
Um, he might have...

27:32.785 --> 27:34.120
had some head trauma
in the accident.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.722
It can cause bleeding
in the brain.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.989
I'm sorry
it wasn't caught earlier.

27:37.023 --> 27:40.159
Okay, let's
get him up to CT.

27:41.994 --> 27:48.134
Unrestrained and no CT--
are you kidding, Abby?

27:51.938 --> 27:53.305
Hey.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.344
What'd the CT show?

27:58.377 --> 28:00.412
Parietal skull fracture
with a subdural hematoma.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.314
Neurosurg has got him
up in the OR now.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.116
How could I miss
a intracranial bleed?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.752
It happens.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.153
He seemed like a perfectly
healthy baby to me.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.454
And you had
an Attending.

28:08.487 --> 28:09.922
No, if I can't trust
my clinical skills,

28:09.956 --> 28:11.490
I might as well go home

28:11.523 --> 28:13.392
because the book stuff
is not going that great either.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.861
Look, when I get back,

28:14.894 --> 28:16.328
we'll pull the charts
and the film,

28:16.362 --> 28:18.297
and we'll just go over it
step-by-step

28:18.330 --> 28:19.766
and see what went wrong.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.933
It's how you learn.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.969
Need some help in here!

28:23.002 --> 28:24.503
What, did they just
forget to tell you
she was septic?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.172
Claimed they didn't know.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.874
Dropped her pressure and
went apneic in the rig.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.141
Lost the pulse right
when we pulled up.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.943
She's in PEA.
Milligram of epi

28:30.977 --> 28:32.011
and stand by
with atropine.
What about your audit?

29:05.044 --> 29:06.378
TAGGART:
Third atropine's in.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.347
LEWIS:
Weak femoral
with compressions.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.016
The trip over
did not help.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.483
She wasn't coding.
She had a good pulse.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.419
Dopa's up to 20;
still don't have a pressure.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.321
I mean, they had no
pedes RTs, no equipment.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.123
Figured it was more
dangerous to leave her

29:17.156 --> 29:18.925
than to bring her back.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.026
Well, they're
a bunch of idiots.

29:20.059 --> 29:20.960
So why didn't you
tube her?

29:20.993 --> 29:22.394
Stop compressions.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.831
LOCKHART:
Still PEA.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.833
Because she was breathing
on her own.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.367
Dr. Lewis, I've got
your geriatric boyfriend
on the phone.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.401
He says it's important.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.037
I'm going to have

29:31.070 --> 29:32.138
to call him back.
Resume compressions.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.539
Come on, Michelle, come on.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.041
Another round of epi.
Where are the parents?

29:35.074 --> 29:36.175
TAGGART:
En route from Geldin.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.476
Do they know how to get here?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.445
I think they're
from Michigan.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.113
She's fixed and dilated.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.249
They better
figure it out fast.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.452
Dr. Morris, your pancreatitis
is a case of menstrual cramps.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.320
Oh.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.156
Uh, so, perhaps in the future,
before you call surgery

29:50.189 --> 29:52.024
you could read chapter one
of Harrison's.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.592
Right.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.862
Can you make sure Amanda Knight
gets 600 of ibuprofen?

29:55.895 --> 29:57.864
Yes, Doctor.
I consulted on that man earlier.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.065
Why isn't he in a bed?

29:59.098 --> 30:00.332
He just signed in.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.868
Mr. Persky's back?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.569
Well, who let him go
in the first place?

30:03.602 --> 30:05.504
Doctor Kovac
discharged him.
Without the CT I ordered?

30:05.537 --> 30:07.073
Mr. Persky,
what happened?

30:07.106 --> 30:09.041
He's febrile.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.042
( groaning )

30:10.076 --> 30:11.043
Oh, God.

30:11.077 --> 30:13.545
( groaning )

30:17.917 --> 30:19.285
It hurt for awhile there,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.520
but... it's much better now.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.222
Think he perfed?

30:23.255 --> 30:26.025
Yes. Mr. Persky, when
the appendix bursts

30:26.058 --> 30:28.194
it releases pressure,
which abates the pain.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.363
Unfortunately, it
also releases fecal
matter into the belly,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.065
requiring us to
operate on you.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.267
Like under anesthesia?

30:35.301 --> 30:36.435
Yes.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.070
Uh-uh.
My mother died that way.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.605
No anesthesia.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.173
During your surgery?

30:41.207 --> 30:43.475
Yes. Going under's
what killed her.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.211
CORDAY:
Right.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.079
Okay, well, let's take
Mr. Persky upstairs

30:47.113 --> 30:48.080
and prep him for surgery.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.181
I'll be right there.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.316
COOP:
Where are you going?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.151
Oh, I'm going to find Dr. Kovac.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.226
LEWIS:
Stop compressions.

31:00.259 --> 31:04.396
LOCKHART:
Asystole.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.934
Resuming compressions.

31:07.934 --> 31:09.368
Should we try
transcutaneous pacing?

31:09.401 --> 31:10.970
How long
has she been down?

31:11.003 --> 31:12.304
42 minutes.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.406
Okay, Gallant.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.441
Gallant?

31:15.474 --> 31:18.244
Time of death-- 15:37.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.020
LEWIS:
There's only so much
responsibility you can take

31:28.054 --> 31:29.188
for what happened.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.257
You didn't give her cancer.

31:31.290 --> 31:35.127
So how come that doesn't
make me feel any better?

31:35.161 --> 31:37.563
LOCKHART:
Those the parents?

31:37.596 --> 31:40.166
Yeah.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.100
Gallant?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.202
I'll tell them.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.745
( knocking at door )

32:26.778 --> 32:29.015
Is it all right if I come in?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.185
Sorry it's taking so long.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.221
Dr. Pratt's been tied up.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.324
But then I suppose
you don't mind the delay.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.659
Will you report
what happened?

32:40.692 --> 32:43.029
I never said anything did.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.065
Because maybe you could be
transferred to another facility,

32:46.098 --> 32:47.199
someplace safer for you.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.734
There's no shame in this.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.437
No one's going to think less
of you for it,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.205
not me,
not your girlfriend.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.508
I don't have one anymore.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.577
I'm the girl now.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.381
Jimmy...

33:02.414 --> 33:04.316
Can you leave me alone?!

33:09.455 --> 33:12.424
ELOISE:
No! It's going to hurt my baby!

33:12.458 --> 33:16.062
Eloise, you have a broken leg.
You need to settle down.
No! No!

33:16.062 --> 33:17.196
Give me five of haldol.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.165
No! It's going
to hurt my baby!

33:19.198 --> 33:20.399
Please! No! No! No!

33:20.432 --> 33:22.734
( sobbing hysterically )

33:22.768 --> 33:24.803
I don't...
I don't want my baby...

33:24.836 --> 33:26.805
I don't want my baby...
to do...

33:26.838 --> 33:30.242
( calming ):
to do...

33:30.276 --> 33:32.111
drugs.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.312
Did you kill her?

33:33.345 --> 33:34.746
No.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.415
Send her up to Ortho

33:36.448 --> 33:39.318
and make sure they cast
her before she wakes up.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.753
( sighs )

33:41.787 --> 33:44.090
Sorry you had to see that.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.457
Did you get scared?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.726
You kidding?
It was cool.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.095
( chuckles )

33:49.128 --> 33:50.596
So what does this thing do,

33:50.629 --> 33:52.398
make you glow in the dark?

33:52.431 --> 33:54.466
Yeah, only after
1,000 x-rays.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.103
Want one?

33:57.136 --> 33:59.805
Can I have one of my head?

33:59.838 --> 34:02.108
Is it okay?

34:02.141 --> 34:04.276
Long as your department
gets charged for it.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.644
( chuckling )

34:05.677 --> 34:08.547
Okay. Lay still,
hold your breath.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.324
I understand
you overrode my order

34:19.358 --> 34:22.128
for an abdominal CT
on the possible appy patient.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.629
Yes.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.797
Well, he's since managed
to perforate his appendix

34:25.831 --> 34:27.565
and is upstairs
waiting for surgery.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.701
So, instead of a quick
laproscopic procedure,

34:29.735 --> 34:32.237
I'll be performing
an open laparotomy

34:32.271 --> 34:34.206
with antiseptic wash-out.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.342
That's too bad.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.311
( sighing ):
Your actions have made
his life and mine much harder.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.246
You know he wants
epidural anesthesia?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.848
What do you want me to say?

34:42.880 --> 34:45.284
Neither a CBC or a CT
would have been definitive.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.319
Sometimes the
best test is time.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.687
You're serious.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.688
He was given discharge
instructions

34:50.722 --> 34:52.324
and came back as directed.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.458
The system worked.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.826
Oh, for you, maybe,

34:54.860 --> 34:56.462
but he'll be subjected
to a riskier surgery

34:56.495 --> 34:58.364
and I'll miss dinner
with my daughter.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.798
Score one
for your bloody mission.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.433
MARQUEZ:
Can you see Morris's crouper

35:01.467 --> 35:03.169
so we can discharge her?

35:03.169 --> 35:04.170
Yeah, in a minute.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.504
And I need a consent

35:05.537 --> 35:07.173
for conscious sedation
for Carolyn Kinaire.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.175
Okay, hang on.

35:09.208 --> 35:11.277
Dr. Lewis.
You know, you have to
present to Kovac or Romano.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.246
I have to call the IRS and
beg not to be imprisoned.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.681
Kovac is not here

35:15.714 --> 35:17.349
and Romano's the reason
why I need this favor.

35:17.383 --> 35:18.784
Great, what'd he do now?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.519
I got a male rape victim
who needs an exam

35:20.552 --> 35:22.454
and Napoleon's not too
comfortable with the prospect.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.756
Homophobe.
Fine, I'll do it.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.791
You're the best.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.393
Ready to go over this?

35:27.426 --> 35:29.428
Uh, yeah, I've denied my bladder
this long...

35:29.461 --> 35:31.263
Ah, the Helen Keller of County.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.365
I hear you missed
a skull fracture today.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.201
Keep it up, you'll be back
to code browns in no time.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.235
Hang on a second.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.569
Hey. You.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.405
What is it, Dr. Lewis?
I'm a busy man.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.207
Well, now you're
one less patient busy.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.208
I'm taking the rape case.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.309
Excuse me?

35:43.342 --> 35:44.643
I don't know
if it's a gay thing,

35:44.676 --> 35:45.744
or if you're afraid
of two-handed procedures...

35:45.777 --> 35:46.812
What are you
talking about?

35:46.845 --> 35:48.280
Pratt feels that...

35:48.314 --> 35:49.315
Pratt is a rabid
dog who needs

35:49.348 --> 35:50.649
to be taken
outside and shot

35:50.682 --> 35:52.718
before he infects the
rest of the staff.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.286
As for my abilities
are concerned, I finish
what I start, okay?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.588
Okay.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.562
Bang.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.232
TAGGART:
Hey, Frank...

36:06.232 --> 36:07.499
Back from
your little joyride?

36:07.533 --> 36:08.834
You seen my kid around?

36:08.867 --> 36:11.503
Yeah, I saw him
stalking Kovac earlier.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.239
Did the IRS call?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.974
Yes, they said something
about penalties, back taxes,

36:16.007 --> 36:18.244
you owing them
for their lost time,

36:18.277 --> 36:20.246
and that Hollander guy
called again.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.380
Did he leave a number?

36:21.413 --> 36:24.250
Nope, just canceled dinner.

36:24.283 --> 36:26.252
I spoke with Mrs. Meyers.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.553
Who?

36:27.586 --> 36:28.754
Meth mom.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.356
She's agreed to
seek counseling,

36:30.389 --> 36:32.258
and social services
will follow up.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.859
They don't want
to see her?

36:33.892 --> 36:35.961
I told them she's obviously
devoted to her family,

36:35.994 --> 36:37.796
takes good care of them.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.266
Be harder to do when she dies
of a drug-induced heart attack.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.800
Well, I'm sure
this scared her,

36:41.833 --> 36:43.902
enough to get the
message, I'd think.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.638
Okay, go with your gut.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.374
Are you sure?

36:48.407 --> 36:50.476
Because it's a bit of
a weakness on my part,

36:50.509 --> 36:52.278
not reading people well.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.280
Never occurred to me

36:54.280 --> 36:56.848
that a working wife
and mother would
be a meth user.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.285
People are capable
of anything

36:59.285 --> 37:01.720
when put
under the right stressors.

37:31.450 --> 37:37.656
( gunshot )

37:40.792 --> 37:43.729
Need help visualizing
the fissure.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.930
Okay.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.465
You want to swab
for sperm, too?

37:46.498 --> 37:48.400
No, we have enough.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.835
Help me take this off.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.337
The bleeding's stopped.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.372
The tear will heal
on its own.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.342
So is he good to go?

37:56.342 --> 37:57.743
Yeah, right back
to the daddy tank

37:57.776 --> 37:59.711
as soon as his discharge
papers are signed.

37:59.745 --> 38:00.912
Excuse me,
Dr. Romano,

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
may I speak
with you privately?

38:02.814 --> 38:05.417
You're already my favorite.
You want people to talk?

38:05.451 --> 38:06.652
His lab work-up.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.420
Why you showing
it to me?

38:08.454 --> 38:11.490
Dr. Pratt's
on his way into Trauma.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.806
Some test results
have come back.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.641
You're HIV-positive

38:29.675 --> 38:34.813
with a CD4 count
of less than 200.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.582
That means
you have AIDS.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.824
Did you hear
what I just said?

38:45.857 --> 38:48.894
Yeah, thanks.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.902
At least now
I know it's not
going to be forever.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.610
That the guy
who got punked out?

39:04.643 --> 39:05.911
Shut up.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.415
He's had a bad day.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.882
Okay, this all looks
well documented, anyway.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.950
Gee, thanks.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.452
Baby had a normal exam

39:13.485 --> 39:15.421
and the mechanism
was borderline.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.823
I would've scanned the head,
but Kovac could argue not to.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.957
It's a judgment call.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.426
Which is why
I ordered a babygram.

39:20.426 --> 39:21.727
When you're reading
an X ray,

39:21.760 --> 39:23.028
are you using
the ABCD mnemonic?

39:23.061 --> 39:25.831
Airway, Bones, Cardiac,
Diaphragm.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.932
Wait,

39:26.965 --> 39:28.734
this is the wrong film.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.902
No, it's Colin Tranh,
and I still don't see it.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.070
Is it more superior?

39:32.103 --> 39:33.171
Do you have the head CT?

39:33.204 --> 39:34.440
Yeah.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.845
Okay, um, here's
the fracture.

39:39.878 --> 39:44.149
And I still don't see it.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.518
It's not there.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.987
Get a social worker
and find the boyfriend now.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.856
Right.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.491
Dr. Lewis,
GSW to the head!

39:52.524 --> 39:54.626
WOMAN:
Went into V-fib
two minutes out.

39:54.660 --> 39:55.961
Robbery, homicide, both?

39:55.994 --> 39:57.863
Self-inflicted.
No time to transfer.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.866
Charge to 200.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.167
Why isn't he intubated?

40:02.200 --> 40:03.569
Because he's a DNR.

40:03.602 --> 40:04.670
That's what
I told him.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.204
But suicide
is against the law.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.006
He could've flinched
and only injured his
frontal cortex.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.975
Okay, let's do this.
8-0 tube.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.076
Come on,
give me those.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.210
TAGGART:
Dr. Lewis?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.912
LEWIS:
Stand by with epi.

40:13.945 --> 40:17.983
PRATT:
Still V-fib, 300.
Clear!

40:22.621 --> 40:23.655
Amp of epi.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.025
He used a gun.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.827
PRATT:
Charge to 360.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.861
Stop it.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.229
Clear.
I said stop it!

40:31.262 --> 40:32.230
What? I'm trying
to save this guy.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.164
A hundred of lidocaine.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.099
She knows him.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.934
Just leave him.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.904
It's what he wanted.

40:46.144 --> 40:47.245
Is the baby out of surgery?

40:47.278 --> 40:48.814
Yeah. I spoke
to the doctor.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.215
It went well.
Where's his mother?

40:50.248 --> 40:51.683
She's at work.
I called her.

40:51.717 --> 40:52.918
So he's going
to be okay, right?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.252
Yes, he will.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.554
This is Mr. Sung.
He's a social worker.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.588
How you doing?

40:56.622 --> 40:57.756
Fine.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.024
What's this all about?

40:59.057 --> 41:00.091
Well, you
mentioned earlier

41:00.125 --> 41:01.927
that Colin cries
a lot.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.529
Yeah. So?

41:03.529 --> 41:04.996
Was he crying
when you got home today?

41:05.030 --> 41:06.565
Why?
It appears his
skull was fractured

41:06.598 --> 41:08.534
after he left
the hospital.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.735
What?

41:09.768 --> 41:10.969
He didn't have
a fracture

41:11.002 --> 41:12.571
when he was
here earlier.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.105
So what are you saying--
I hit him?

41:14.139 --> 41:15.774
I don't know
what you did.

41:15.807 --> 41:16.942
Did you slam his head
against the wall?

41:16.975 --> 41:18.043
Or the floor?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.210
Abby...
The crib railing?

41:19.244 --> 41:20.679
I don't have to listen
to this crap!

41:20.712 --> 41:21.913
I'll take it from here.
This is ridiculous.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.181
Why don't you come
with me?

41:23.214 --> 41:24.583
She's nuts!
I didn't hit that kid!

41:24.616 --> 41:25.584
I didn't do anything.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.152
Excuse me. You're nuts!

41:27.185 --> 41:28.987
Lady, you don't know
what you're talking about!

41:29.020 --> 41:30.889
I didn't hit
that stupid kid!

41:30.922 --> 41:32.190
Hey!

41:32.223 --> 41:34.225
Alex, this room's
for families

41:34.259 --> 41:35.293
who need privacy.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.294
Come on.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.295
Super power punch.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.797
Quit knocking me off.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.998
Plus it's time to go.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.567
But I'm winning.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.268
Alex, it's late
and I'm tired.

41:43.301 --> 41:46.805
Fine.

41:46.838 --> 41:47.839
See ya.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.040
See ya.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.075
Did you make
a new friend today?

41:50.108 --> 41:51.743
Guess so.
Cool.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.713
Hey, would it be okay
if we invite him over

41:54.746 --> 41:56.147
for Thanksgiving dinner?

41:56.181 --> 41:58.617
He doesn't really have
any family.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.586
Sure.
Okay.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.822
Oh, wait,
I forgot something.

42:05.691 --> 42:06.925
You finish
your homework?

42:06.958 --> 42:08.627
Yeah, but look.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.596
It's my head.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.997
Dr. Kovac did it
for me.

42:12.030 --> 42:12.998
He X-rayed your skull?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.000
Night.
Yeah.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.001
Hi.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.703
You going home then?

42:17.736 --> 42:20.205
Yeah, my family's here
to pick me up.

42:20.238 --> 42:24.009
Listen, I just
want to thank you
for everything, okay?

42:25.043 --> 42:26.612
Hey! Do you guys want me

42:26.645 --> 42:28.747
to make spaghetti
tonight for dinner?

42:31.016 --> 42:32.083
Uh, Neela,

42:32.117 --> 42:34.653
labs are back
on my lupus patient.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.788
How do you calculate
creatine clearance?

42:36.822 --> 42:38.624
Weight in kilos times 140,

42:38.657 --> 42:41.727
minus age,
divided by 72,
times creatine.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.163
Thanks.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.331
Have a good night.

42:47.966 --> 42:49.334
Abby, would you
be interested

42:49.367 --> 42:51.102
in studying together
some time?

42:51.136 --> 42:52.638
Sorry?

42:52.671 --> 42:55.741
I'm good at the academic
stuff, you know?

42:55.774 --> 42:58.143
But you're good
with everything else.

42:58.176 --> 43:00.145
Maybe we could
help each other.

43:00.178 --> 43:01.246
Okay.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.102
Hey, Dr. Lewis.
What is it?

43:24.135 --> 43:26.137
The LOL in two
is complaining of nausea.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.739
All right, give her
ten of compazine

43:27.773 --> 43:29.174
and make sure she
gets a dinner tray.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.275
Pretty rough day,
today, huh?

43:30.308 --> 43:31.710
Yeah.

43:31.743 --> 43:32.678
Did you hear
from Jing-Mei?

43:32.678 --> 43:34.279
She got on a plane.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.782
Did you send in
a blood draw
this morning,

43:36.815 --> 43:37.749
check a didge level?

43:37.783 --> 43:39.117
Yeah.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.151
The tube you sent
was hemolyzed.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.720
They need another draw.

43:41.753 --> 43:42.821
What do you want me
to tell them?

43:42.854 --> 43:43.989
Tell 'em he left AMA.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.957
Time's up.
Where's my hand?

43:45.991 --> 43:47.192
It's in the
women's bathroom
in the tampon machine.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.994
Get it yourself.
