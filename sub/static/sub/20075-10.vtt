00:03.304 --> 00:05.510
I need you to tell the
Governor about Stewart.

00:05.516 --> 00:07.137
He's the Deputy Governor!

00:07.354 --> 00:09.304
Will Jackson told Vera I'm dealing.

00:09.898 --> 00:11.437
- I can't remember.
- Tell her!

00:11.443 --> 00:12.671
Mr Jackson!

00:12.677 --> 00:16.201
He's not at home, not answering
his phone and no one's seen him.

00:16.207 --> 00:19.285
- AYOUB: Don is officially missing.
- (muffled and echoing) Ah, Liz!

00:19.291 --> 00:21.524
- I know Sonia did it.
- What did she do, Liz?

00:21.530 --> 00:23.713
She killed Detective Kaplan, Ms Bennett.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.146
If we leave these boxes out...

00:26.448 --> 00:27.936
Oh, yeah, that's good.

00:27.942 --> 00:29.927
I'm gonna catch you red-handed, okay,

00:29.933 --> 00:31.551
and then Vera'll find out.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.745
You see,

00:34.146 --> 00:35.682
Vera and me...

00:35.854 --> 00:37.161
we're living together.

00:37.263 --> 00:38.590
You can't touch me.

00:38.849 --> 00:41.185
You're the one who tipped
off Jake, aren't you?

00:42.044 --> 00:44.169
You want revenge on him so badly,

00:44.175 --> 00:46.469
- it is distorting your thinking.
- My thinking?

00:46.475 --> 00:48.740
You're the one who's
fucking a drug dealer!

00:48.923 --> 00:52.344
- What... what is that? That...
- Oh, it's a kite.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.723
It means freedom.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.278
- Morning, Vera.
- Mr Channing.

02:35.284 --> 02:37.589
The gatehouse said you were on your
way up. Can I offer you a coffee?

02:37.595 --> 02:39.074
Long macchiato would be good.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.306
Would you make a coffee

02:40.312 --> 02:41.570
- for Mr Channing?
- WOMAN: <i>Certainly.</i>

02:41.576 --> 02:44.275
Now I'm here to investigate
a rather disturbing complaint.

02:44.281 --> 02:45.555
Yes, from Will Jackson.

02:45.571 --> 02:48.639
What the fuck is going
on with your staff, Vera?

02:48.757 --> 02:51.272
He's accusing your Acting
Deputy of being a drug supplier.

02:51.278 --> 02:53.923
Yeah, and I can assure you, there
is no truth to that allegation.

02:53.929 --> 02:57.154
And you know this because
you're banging the accused?

02:59.655 --> 03:03.539
It is true that Mr Stewart and I
have a private relationship, but

03:03.545 --> 03:05.478
- there's nothing in the regulations...
- I don't give a rat's arse

03:05.484 --> 03:09.672
about the regulations, but I do
care if it's clouding your judgement.

03:09.678 --> 03:11.086
No, it isn't.

03:11.688 --> 03:14.290
Mr Stewart's work
record speaks for itself.

03:14.605 --> 03:16.501
He has been an excellent Deputy

03:16.507 --> 03:18.399
and I have found absolutely no cause

03:18.405 --> 03:20.868
- to doubt his integrity as an officer.
- We'll see.

03:21.165 --> 03:23.368
I'll need an office to
conduct my enquiries.

03:23.374 --> 03:25.425
Okay, I will have one of
the admin offices prepared.

03:25.431 --> 03:28.029
- No, I'd prefer the hearing room.
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.117 --> 03:29.934
You can bring my coffee in there.

03:35.255 --> 03:36.716
Derek.

03:37.169 --> 03:39.060
I wondered when you'd show up.

03:39.263 --> 03:40.961
- Why do you say that?
- (lift bell dings)

03:41.857 --> 03:43.867
Well, the prison's in a shambles.

03:43.945 --> 03:45.859
All down to poor management skills

03:45.865 --> 03:48.559
and an utter lack of
leadership, I'd say.

03:48.565 --> 03:50.864
- Well, at least it's not on fire.
- -

03:59.631 --> 04:01.438
How do you know Mike Pennisi?

04:02.238 --> 04:03.438
Who?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.924
These are my posts.
How did you get them?

04:11.930 --> 04:15.228
I got permission to access the net
to prove that chick provoked you.

04:15.392 --> 04:17.380
Wow. (Chuckles)

04:17.387 --> 04:18.767
You got influence. (Chuckles)

04:19.516 --> 04:20.716
This guy.

04:21.265 --> 04:24.691
- How do you know him?
- I don't. He's just some...

04:24.697 --> 04:27.351
random guy who responded
to one of my posts.

04:27.357 --> 04:30.070
It's an incredible coincidence.
It's doing my head in.

04:30.366 --> 04:31.566
Do you know him?

04:31.656 --> 04:33.870
Yeah, he was the guy
I supposedly murdered.

04:34.068 --> 04:35.354
But I didn't.

04:36.445 --> 04:37.679
I believe you.

04:37.685 --> 04:39.576
Well, that makes you
an endangered species.

04:39.582 --> 04:41.186
Yeah. Well, I am rare and exotic.

04:41.192 --> 04:43.894
It's a bummer. I was hoping
you could shed some light.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.878
Sorry. I've never met the guy.

04:45.884 --> 04:48.884
(ominous undertone)

04:56.151 --> 04:57.351
(music ends)

04:57.357 --> 04:58.765
Oh, it's all horseshit!

04:59.446 --> 05:00.742
Sorry, sir.

05:01.189 --> 05:04.096
So why do you think, ah, Jackson
is saying these things about you

05:04.102 --> 05:05.660
if there's not a shred of truth in it?

05:05.666 --> 05:07.736
I know why. He's had
his nose out of joint

05:07.742 --> 05:09.813
ever since I got promoted
to act in his position.

05:09.819 --> 05:13.077
So that's your explanation,
is it? Professional jealousy?

05:13.468 --> 05:15.259
Mmm, not so professional.

05:15.265 --> 05:16.665
He's really got it in for me.

05:16.671 --> 05:18.447
He shoved me up against
a wall yesterday.

05:18.453 --> 05:20.097
- You reported that?
- No.

05:20.103 --> 05:22.345
- I'm not the vindictive type.
- Yeah, that's right. Ah...

05:22.351 --> 05:25.464
you're a lover, not a fighter, huh?

05:27.446 --> 05:28.867
I will say...

05:29.275 --> 05:32.458
Jackson is the only staff
member with a history of drug use

05:32.464 --> 05:35.056
- and charges on his record.
- Noted.

05:35.446 --> 05:36.873
But just so you know,

05:36.879 --> 05:39.658
I will be interviewing all the
staff in relation to this matter.

05:39.664 --> 05:41.061
Good. (Sniffs)

05:41.585 --> 05:43.585
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome.

05:43.591 --> 05:44.791
(Stewart clears throat)

05:47.468 --> 05:50.752
Oh, and, um, good luck with that, sir.

05:51.565 --> 05:52.874
(door closes)

05:53.938 --> 05:55.139
(throbbing music intensifying)

05:55.145 --> 05:57.375
Turk, we've got a bit
of a situation here.

05:57.956 --> 06:00.549
I need you to hold off on the
deliveries for the time being.

06:00.555 --> 06:02.443
Well, fuck your situation!

06:02.509 --> 06:05.010
Ah, we've got the regional
manager in. He's investigating.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.595
<i>Yeah, well you go tell
him to stick his head</i>

06:06.601 --> 06:09.220
up a dead bear's fuckin'
arse and investigate that.

06:09.314 --> 06:12.009
<i>I'm trying to run a fuckin'
business, you shithead!</i>

06:12.015 --> 06:13.715
Yeah, I know. I'm just...

06:14.486 --> 06:15.687
(mobile beeps off)

06:15.693 --> 06:17.573
- Oi!
- Jake?

06:20.604 --> 06:22.718
- What's going on?
- (sighing) Oh...

06:24.942 --> 06:26.239
Are you all right?

06:26.528 --> 06:29.350
Yeah. Yeah, I've just got a
bit of a headache, that's all.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.744
Well, what happened with Channing?
You said you'd come tell me.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.146
Oh, shit! I'm sorry, I forgot.

06:34.317 --> 06:36.857
Well, I hope you're taking
this seriously. Mud sticks.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.545
I am taking it seriously.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.857
Very seriously indeed.

06:49.622 --> 06:52.114
(phone ringing in background)

06:52.192 --> 06:54.348
I know you won't be happy
with me bringing Channing in.

06:54.354 --> 06:55.859
Oh, ten points for perception, Will.

06:55.865 --> 06:57.770
Look, believe it or not,
this is in your best interests

06:57.776 --> 06:59.364
- as well.
- Oh yeah, how do you figure that?

06:59.370 --> 07:00.575
Look...

07:00.581 --> 07:04.081
I... I was totally out of line with
that accusation yesterday, okay?

07:04.236 --> 07:05.815
And I apologise.

07:06.307 --> 07:08.004
You're a good governor, Vera,

07:08.010 --> 07:10.385
but Stewart will bring you down
if you don't wake up to him.

07:10.391 --> 07:11.591
(scoffs)

07:11.597 --> 07:13.299
(hushed) Look, I am wide awake,

07:13.635 --> 07:16.442
thank you very much, and I can
see that your disgruntlement

07:16.448 --> 07:18.114
- has got the better of you.
- That... that's got nothing

07:18.120 --> 07:19.320
- to do with it.
- Really?

07:19.429 --> 07:22.531
Because you seem hell-bent on
destroying two very fine careers,

07:22.537 --> 07:24.969
Mr Stewart's and your
own, for no reason.

07:27.665 --> 07:29.436
(door beeps unlocked)

07:29.442 --> 07:32.420
(indistinct background
chatter and yelling)

rhythmic triangle tinging)

08:07.871 --> 08:10.683
WOMAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.</i>

08:10.689 --> 08:12.707
<i>Phones are now available for use.</i>

08:15.787 --> 08:16.987
Hey.

08:18.128 --> 08:19.548
Franky.

08:22.594 --> 08:24.522
(hushed) I need to borrow the mobile.

08:24.528 --> 08:25.834
What mobile?

08:25.917 --> 08:28.042
I know Tina's got one stashed.

08:28.571 --> 08:30.388
(scoffing) Unbelievable.

08:30.571 --> 08:32.844
You only speak to me
when you want something.

08:32.850 --> 08:34.169
- Kimmy...
- Fuck off!

08:34.174 --> 08:35.876
Kimmy, please! There's no
one else who can help me.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.374
- It's really important.
- Who do you wanna call?

08:39.749 --> 08:42.077
- Bridget.
- Oh, the fuckin' slag.

08:42.082 --> 08:43.788
- She's not a slag.
- She resigned.

08:43.794 --> 08:45.577
What, she dump you 'cause
you're back in here?

08:45.583 --> 08:47.157
We broke up, yeah.

08:47.842 --> 08:50.481
But it was mutual. It's too hard,

08:50.551 --> 08:53.043
- for both of us.
- Yeah, sucks being you.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.864
Now you know how it feels.

08:54.870 --> 08:57.170
- Kimmy, I didn't want to hurt you.
- (scoffs)

08:58.159 --> 08:59.962
I just fell in love with her.

09:00.980 --> 09:03.692
It was the first time I
ever let myself go there.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.420
And it just wasn't something
I could control, you know?

09:07.558 --> 09:08.758
(chuckles wryly)

09:10.136 --> 09:12.870
That's how I felt about you, Franky...

09:13.245 --> 09:14.491
once.

09:14.672 --> 09:16.265
Then please...

09:16.825 --> 09:18.760
(hushed) please let me use that phone.

09:19.451 --> 09:20.651
(sighs)

09:21.020 --> 09:23.082
(emotionally) If you won't
fuck off, I'm leaving.

09:36.254 --> 09:37.525
- WOMAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.</i>
- (door opening)

09:37.531 --> 09:38.942
- <i>Attention, compound.</i>
- Morning.

09:38.948 --> 09:41.574
- <i>The canteen is now open...</i>
- Appreciate you coming in.

09:41.738 --> 09:44.256
- I hope I can help.
- (sighing) Now...

09:45.574 --> 09:50.964
Now it says here you had counselling
sessions with Mr Jackson. Why?

09:51.072 --> 09:54.330
Governor Bennett made it a
condition of his return to work.

09:54.336 --> 09:57.128
After he was suspended
for a positive drug test?

09:57.134 --> 09:59.526
- Mmm, yes.
- So in your professional opinion,

09:59.532 --> 10:00.821
was Jackson...

10:01.174 --> 10:03.164
resentful of the Acting Deputy?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.583
Would he be likely to fabricate
allegations against him?

10:05.589 --> 10:08.119
I can't disclose what was
confidentially discussed

10:08.125 --> 10:10.063
- in those sessions.
- So that's a yes?

10:10.069 --> 10:11.697
I think you're putting
words in my mouth.

10:11.703 --> 10:13.505
In the absence of your own.

10:13.778 --> 10:15.844
Come on, Ms Westfall.

10:16.242 --> 10:17.836
Just give me something here.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.768
Well... (laughs)

10:23.250 --> 10:26.272
What I can tell you is
that Mr Jackson's only anger

10:26.278 --> 10:28.809
was directed towards himself for having

10:28.815 --> 10:31.380
made the mistake for taking drugs.

10:31.386 --> 10:32.764
So the allegations?

10:32.770 --> 10:34.908
He must believe he
had sufficient grounds.

10:34.914 --> 10:38.638
And what about you? Did you ever
have any knowledge or suspicion

10:38.817 --> 10:41.239
that Mr Stewart was supplying
drugs to the prisoners?

10:41.245 --> 10:42.806
None whatsoever, no.

10:42.812 --> 10:45.622
- (door beeps unlocked)
- WILL: <i>Stewart's not gonna last.</i>

10:46.294 --> 10:48.743
The regional manager's
here. He's investigating.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.887
(chuckles wryly)
Think he'll get to the truth?

10:50.893 --> 10:52.886
Well, he should. He's a tough prick.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.054
Hope he nails his arse to the wall.

10:55.136 --> 10:57.480
I don't have your faith in the system.

10:57.661 --> 10:59.814
Call me a radical feminist sceptic.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.794
- Oh, I've called you worse.
- (chuckles) I remember.

11:03.559 --> 11:06.263
If this doesn't work,
you've got no moves left.

11:06.783 --> 11:08.106
(sighing) Yeah.

11:11.530 --> 11:12.745
Franky?

11:15.644 --> 11:18.185
Two minutes. I'll wait outside.

11:19.231 --> 11:20.525
Thank you.

11:21.413 --> 11:22.865
- No problem.
- (gentle music)

11:23.282 --> 11:25.769
- Oh, please pick up! Please pick up!
- (ringing tone)

11:25.956 --> 11:27.370
- (phone clicks)
- BRIDGET: <i>Hello?</i>

11:27.376 --> 11:28.766
Gidget, it's me.

11:28.971 --> 11:30.974
- <i>How did you get through...</i>
- Hey, I'll explain later.

11:30.980 --> 11:32.589
- I've only got two minutes.
- <i>Franky...</i>

11:32.595 --> 11:34.243
Look, I know you don't
want to talk to me.

11:34.249 --> 11:36.575
- <i>I'm just desperate for your help.</i>
- (door beeps unlocked)

11:36.581 --> 11:37.781
(sighs)

11:39.200 --> 11:41.159
- (door closing)
- There she is.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.392
(hushed) Thanks for coming in.

11:50.399 --> 11:52.298
I wish I could say no.

11:53.023 --> 11:54.782
So, um...?

11:54.985 --> 11:57.220
What was it on the phone
you couldn't talk about?

11:57.704 --> 12:00.525
- You remember that new prisoner, Iman?
- Mm-hmm.

12:00.531 --> 12:03.134
So I'm helping her with
some legal advocacy stuff

12:03.140 --> 12:07.130
and I find out she's got a social
media connection to Mike Pennisi.

12:07.918 --> 12:11.328
- "The" Mike Pennisi?
- How is that a coincidence?

12:11.423 --> 12:14.118
- That's a mother of a coincidence.
- (laughs)

12:14.183 --> 12:15.912
Now, I know it's a long shot,

12:15.918 --> 12:18.004
but I reckon it's worth
looking into her background.

12:18.010 --> 12:19.699
Yeah. That's what I said
on the phone, Franky.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.084
It's a job for your lawyer.

12:21.785 --> 12:23.940
That's the name of her therapist.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.058
I want you to talk to her.

12:26.909 --> 12:31.020
I just want to know if Iman
knew Pennisi. That's it.

12:31.026 --> 12:33.933
- No confidential shit.
- I don't know this woman.

12:33.939 --> 12:36.599
If I start asking questions
about one of her clients,

12:36.605 --> 12:38.479
she could report me to the Psych Board.

12:38.485 --> 12:40.795
Just explain to her that
you've got a client in prison

12:40.801 --> 12:42.193
for a murder she didn't commit.

12:42.199 --> 12:45.023
If you were a client, I
wouldn't be sitting here.

12:46.606 --> 12:48.103
(hushed) Please, Gidge.

12:48.437 --> 12:50.438
It's my only lead.

12:51.226 --> 12:54.971
It could be the difference between
freedom and 20 years in here.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.936
(whispered) Okay.

13:02.452 --> 13:03.652
(music ends)

13:03.658 --> 13:06.951
- (whooshing flourish)
- (lights flicking and buzzing on)

13:06.957 --> 13:09.957
(throbbing and wailing
music intensifying)

13:18.098 --> 13:19.298
(music ends)

13:22.496 --> 13:23.696
(sighs)

13:25.616 --> 13:26.816
Hey.

13:26.857 --> 13:29.261
- (Sonia sighs)
- You're missing dinner.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.594
I'm not hungry.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.658
I heard you got a date
for your committal hearing.

13:33.664 --> 13:35.974
Ah, the prison grapevine.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.972
If only the NBN was as fast.

13:37.978 --> 13:41.566
Well, I'm here as your peer
worker, if you'd like to chat.

13:41.893 --> 13:44.576
I'd have hoped you'd be
here as my friend, Liz.

13:44.582 --> 13:47.613
Yeah, well, you know, that...
that's... (chuckling) that too.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.933
You're the only real friend
I have in here, you know.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.729
Can't imagine why the Governor
saw fit to put me in here with Kaz

13:52.735 --> 13:54.557
and her gang of nutcrackers.

13:54.563 --> 13:55.809
(sighs deeply)

13:55.815 --> 13:58.747
Well, why don't I make us a cup of
tea? Do you want a Fruitilicious?

13:58.815 --> 14:03.016
No. I think I need
something a little harder.

14:03.022 --> 14:06.022
(ominous undertone)

14:07.419 --> 14:08.923
(Sonia sighs)

14:08.929 --> 14:13.157
A new delivery of my special shampoo.

14:16.766 --> 14:17.971
Take a seat.

14:17.977 --> 14:20.071
No, no, no, no. None...
none for me, thanks. Thanks.

14:20.077 --> 14:22.556
- Oh, come on. One won't hurt.
- (echoing drum beat)

14:22.562 --> 14:25.384
No, Sonia, I'm... I'm not
much of a drinker these days.

14:25.858 --> 14:28.264
18 years old, smoky.

14:28.270 --> 14:30.843
(sniffs) Like a cigarette.

14:31.301 --> 14:33.083
Oh, sweet Jesus!

14:33.309 --> 14:34.707
Oh, for God's sake, Liz,

14:34.713 --> 14:37.411
stop standing there like
a statue and sit down.

14:38.301 --> 14:40.550
I do feel like a chat.

14:46.752 --> 14:51.176
You're not drinking, Liz. Well,
just have a little sip. It's sublime.

14:51.488 --> 14:56.886
Hey, you know, you know the
obsessive cop that you told us about,

14:56.892 --> 15:00.793
- will he be at the committal hearing?
- I told you, he's gone.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.902
Yeah, but when you say "gone", I
mean what do you... what do you mean?

15:02.908 --> 15:04.152
Gone.

15:06.913 --> 15:09.124
No, no, I'm... still fine.

15:09.130 --> 15:10.330
(scoffing) Oh!

15:10.336 --> 15:12.241
Well, I'm gonna go to bed then if
you're not going to drink with me.

15:12.247 --> 15:14.098
Actually, it's just as well
because the more I drink,

15:14.104 --> 15:15.569
the more I tend to
shoot off at the mouth.

15:15.575 --> 15:16.981
Well, no, don't...

15:20.176 --> 15:21.895
Well... if...

15:22.040 --> 15:23.729
Fuck it! I'll just...

15:23.735 --> 15:25.935
(ominous undertone intensifying)

15:26.540 --> 15:27.878
Oh!

15:27.884 --> 15:29.084
(chuckles)

15:30.363 --> 15:31.563
(exhales)

15:31.569 --> 15:32.769
Oh.

15:33.126 --> 15:35.342
(coughs and sniffs) Mmm.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.069
That is, um...

15:38.240 --> 15:40.451
- That's smoky.
- Yeah.

15:41.646 --> 15:45.258
How... how can you be sure

15:46.291 --> 15:48.423
that that cop won't turn up?

15:48.429 --> 15:49.629
(chuckles)

15:50.810 --> 15:52.356
Because...

15:53.697 --> 15:55.230
(hushed) I killed him.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.503
Y... you... you did?

16:00.842 --> 16:02.327
Yeah.

16:04.322 --> 16:05.613
How?

16:06.019 --> 16:08.316
Well, if you really
want the gory details?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.790
Yes.

16:11.113 --> 16:12.369
Well...

16:13.417 --> 16:16.372
I had to drug him first, of
course. Quite a big fellow.

16:16.378 --> 16:17.586
And then I

16:17.592 --> 16:20.174
drove him to a little secluded
lake I know in South Gippsland.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.477
It's quite lovely. It's the
middle of nowhere. It's beautiful.

16:22.571 --> 16:27.256
And I simply pushed him out of
the car onto a tarp. Very easy.

16:27.262 --> 16:30.102
I bludgeoned him into
unconsciousness with a tree branch.

16:30.108 --> 16:31.407
Not so easy.

16:31.507 --> 16:34.852
And I simply rolled his
body in a weighted-down tarp

16:34.858 --> 16:38.492
and pushed him off the
jetty into the water. Done!

16:41.902 --> 16:44.513
(Liz sobs)

16:45.625 --> 16:47.643
(panting)

16:47.750 --> 16:52.875
(retches and vomits)

16:54.762 --> 16:57.202
(whimpering)

17:05.365 --> 17:12.030
(sobbing)

17:17.849 --> 17:19.920
(whooshing flourish)

17:23.630 --> 17:25.050
- (music ends)
- (warped fluttering)

17:25.057 --> 17:26.257
(knocking on door)

17:27.556 --> 17:28.835
Excuse me, Governor, I've got

17:28.841 --> 17:31.477
- Liz Birdsworth to see you.
- Yeah, for God's sake! Linda,

17:31.483 --> 17:33.907
not now. I have got enough on my plate

17:33.913 --> 17:35.354
- without... Yeah.
- She's quite distressed.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.071
She said it's a matter
of life and death.

17:37.077 --> 17:39.384
- Okay, what's it about?
- I dunno.

17:39.957 --> 17:41.507
Was I supposed to ask?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.961
No, great to see you using
your initiative. Send her in.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.031
- She'll see you now.
- (sighs) Right.

17:47.656 --> 17:50.242
Okay, I've got limited time,
Liz. What's the problem?

17:50.248 --> 17:51.767
- It's... it's Sonia.
- (door closing)

17:51.773 --> 17:55.374
Last night she confessed to killing
Don... D... Detective Kaplan.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.468
- Oh, Liz.
- I knew she did it and I told you.

17:58.474 --> 18:02.266
But hearing her actual confession,
fuck, that was something else.

18:02.272 --> 18:06.157
And she went into all the
friggin' details, too. Poor Don!

18:06.163 --> 18:08.555
- Liz, I don't know what to do.
- You have to get

18:08.561 --> 18:10.117
the police involved, Ms Bennett.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.666
You gotta get 'em in here now

18:11.672 --> 18:14.143
and I'll sign the statement.
I'll make a statement.

18:14.149 --> 18:16.027
Do you really want to go
down that rabbit hole again?

18:16.033 --> 18:18.658
What's the rabbit... rabbit hole?
What the he... What do you mean?

18:18.664 --> 18:20.026
Claiming that Sonia

18:20.032 --> 18:22.610
confessed another murder
to you. Given the last time,

18:22.616 --> 18:24.704
you don't think you might
have some credibility issues?

18:24.710 --> 18:26.813
No, no, no, don't say that,
please. Don't say that.

18:26.819 --> 18:28.625
Oh, Liz! Okay. Liz.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.160
- Liz? Okay.
- Mmm.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.467
I know you're concerned

18:32.473 --> 18:35.054
- about Detective Kaplan.
- Yeah, I am.

18:35.060 --> 18:37.475
You might just be creating
more trouble for yourself.

18:37.774 --> 18:39.393
(hushed) Yeah, right.

18:39.399 --> 18:42.030
(breathing deeply)

18:42.358 --> 18:46.260
So fuckin' up the first
time has bit me on the arse.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.457
That's what you're saying.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.746
(sniffs)

18:51.242 --> 18:53.351
I knew she did it.

18:53.651 --> 18:56.166
- (grinding and hammering)
- BOOMER: <i>Okay... Watch it!</i>

18:59.228 --> 19:03.203
(Boomer giving indistinct directions)

19:16.553 --> 19:17.967
Hey, boss?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.850
Can I go to the toilet?

19:23.733 --> 19:26.733
(urgent music)

19:54.106 --> 19:55.606
Hold it right there.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.890
I said, hold your frickin' horses, Novak.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.689
What? I thought you didn't
want us to waste time.

20:00.695 --> 20:03.108
- Step away from the bench.
- What is this?

20:03.114 --> 20:05.574
Right, this is quality
control, all right?

20:05.580 --> 20:08.580
(music darkens)

20:11.622 --> 20:13.018
What the fuck!

20:13.341 --> 20:15.940
Where are the friggin'
planter boxes, Goldfish?

20:15.946 --> 20:17.521
What, aren't they in there?

20:17.941 --> 20:20.851
Oh, fuck, sorry! I... I must have...

20:20.857 --> 20:22.057
Where's Franky?

20:26.773 --> 20:29.773
(piercing ominous undertone)

20:30.477 --> 20:31.810
(drum beat flourish)

20:31.966 --> 20:33.358
BOOMER: Franky?!

20:35.608 --> 20:36.808
(undertone quells momentarily)

20:37.159 --> 20:38.487
(clattering)

20:40.698 --> 20:42.119
What the fuck are you doin'?

20:42.125 --> 20:43.995
- I was goin' to the pisser.
- Oh yeah, right.

20:44.001 --> 20:46.327
You missed the pisser
'cause it's back there, eh?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.933
- Oh!
- And why'd you bring the boxes with ya?

20:49.452 --> 20:51.632
They were just in my hands. I'm just...

20:53.192 --> 20:54.801
Get 'em back out there.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.546
- Can I just, um...
- Now!

20:59.150 --> 21:00.603
All right!

21:01.200 --> 21:04.697
You're the boss. And lovin' it!

21:04.960 --> 21:06.160
(music ends)

21:06.166 --> 21:08.465
Were neither of you paying
attention at the briefing?

21:08.471 --> 21:11.588
We got our first delivery
goin' out next week.

21:11.594 --> 21:13.455
I don't want anyone...

21:13.658 --> 21:15.366
(emotionally) cockin' that up for us.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.841
- Okay?
- Yep.

21:16.847 --> 21:19.261
I think it's best if
you find a new work unit.

21:19.267 --> 21:20.767
I can think of plenty of women

21:20.773 --> 21:22.864
who'll show the kind of
commitment we require here.

21:22.870 --> 21:24.377
Sonia, we're sorry.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.887
We stuffed up but it won't
happen again. I guarantee it.

21:26.893 --> 21:29.667
You're right, it won't
happen again. You're out.

21:29.673 --> 21:31.375
- What?
- Aren't you forgetting that

21:31.381 --> 21:33.586
I saved this entire project?

21:34.468 --> 21:36.678
I could just as easily unsave it.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.784
What do you think, Susan?

21:40.983 --> 21:42.615
Do we let them stay?

21:48.449 --> 21:49.885
I guess.

21:56.681 --> 21:58.291
What's goin' on, Franky?

21:58.609 --> 22:00.878
I'm just trying to help
Iman with her defence.

22:01.376 --> 22:05.501
Nuh. Don't give me that
acting dumb stuff, all right?

22:05.507 --> 22:09.500
I know you're not stupid. You
and Allie are up to sumpin'.

22:10.386 --> 22:14.194
What happened with the boxes
was a mistake, Booms. I'm sorry.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.628
- Don't you bullshit me.
- Come on, Booms!

22:16.634 --> 22:18.391
You're my number one. You know that.

22:18.397 --> 22:21.118
- Yeah, I'm your number one? Am I?
- Yeah! Yes!

22:21.124 --> 22:22.646
Okay, so how come you
spend all your time

22:22.652 --> 22:24.334
hanging out with Goldilocks then?

22:24.340 --> 22:27.953
Oh, what's it to you? You turned
into a lezzo or something, have ya?

22:29.109 --> 22:30.820
Come... come here.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.120
- No.
- Come here.

22:32.126 --> 22:36.411
Look, I just feel sorry for her
'cause of what happened with Red, okay?

22:36.796 --> 22:39.408
- Come here. I've neglected ya.
- Yeah.

22:39.414 --> 22:41.080
- Yes.
- Yeah, you have.

22:41.086 --> 22:42.790
- Yeah.
- I've missed ya.

22:43.598 --> 22:44.885
I'm sorry.

22:45.689 --> 22:47.869
Look, this charge is doin' my head in.

22:48.463 --> 22:50.978
And I gotta find a
way to beat it, Booms,

22:51.271 --> 22:53.111
or I'm gonna end up dead.

22:53.895 --> 22:56.004
MAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.</i>

22:56.010 --> 22:58.701
- <i>Count will commence in ten minutes.</i>
- You know... (chuckles)

23:00.895 --> 23:04.994
this is the first time in my whole life

23:05.395 --> 23:06.886
that I... I've...

23:07.654 --> 23:09.374
I've been good at sumpin',

23:09.554 --> 23:11.675
- Mmm.
- except for breaking heads, you know?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.974
- And you're ace at that.
- No, I'm serious.

23:13.980 --> 23:20.007
All right? Someone has seen
something that's smart in me.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.322
Not just a bonehead bruiser.

23:23.328 --> 23:25.000
- I didn't mean that.
- Listen!

23:25.006 --> 23:28.322
I've been given
responsibility and for once...

23:29.205 --> 23:31.619
for once, I feel special.

23:32.323 --> 23:36.523
Yeah? Like... like people
are actually looking up to me.

23:38.635 --> 23:40.541
That's awesome, Booms.

23:41.432 --> 23:42.671
I'm happy for ya.

23:42.677 --> 23:46.299
So I'm just saying, don't
screw that up for me, okay?

23:58.187 --> 24:00.215
(exhales, hushed) Fuck!

24:03.337 --> 24:05.328
(banging on door)

24:07.726 --> 24:09.408
Did you forget your key again?

24:09.629 --> 24:11.053
- Where's Jake?
- (menacing music)

24:11.731 --> 24:13.441
Oh, I'm afraid Jake's
not home at the moment,

24:13.447 --> 24:15.563
- so you can call back another time.
- Yeah.

24:15.723 --> 24:18.145
Get... get out of my house!

24:18.151 --> 24:20.365
- Where is he?
- I told you, he's not here.

24:21.468 --> 24:23.468
If you don't leave now,
I will call the police.

24:23.474 --> 24:24.674
Jake!

24:27.271 --> 24:30.094
Ah, shit! No, you don't. Hey!

24:30.210 --> 24:31.778
- VERA: What the fuck?
- Nuh!

24:32.266 --> 24:34.674
- Get off! Oh!
- Bitch! Hey!

24:35.142 --> 24:37.855
Listen here, me and
Jakey had a fuckin' deal!

24:37.861 --> 24:39.109
If he wants to renege,

24:39.115 --> 24:41.488
you tell him he still
owes me that fuckin' money.

24:41.494 --> 24:45.236
- Let me go.
- No, no, you tell him Turk said,

24:45.242 --> 24:47.886
pay up or he's a fucking dead man!

24:47.892 --> 24:49.332
(Vera gasping)

24:50.190 --> 24:52.494
(breathing heavily)

24:52.500 --> 24:53.700
(door slams)

24:56.119 --> 24:57.319
Oh!

24:57.609 --> 24:58.809
(music ends)

24:58.815 --> 25:00.033
JAKE: Vera?

25:01.865 --> 25:03.127
Vera?

25:09.171 --> 25:10.371
Hey.

25:11.152 --> 25:12.370
You okay?

25:12.376 --> 25:15.662
I had a visit from a man called...

25:16.589 --> 25:19.386
- Turk. I don't think he was Turkish.
- Oh, fuck.

25:20.012 --> 25:21.670
He didn't hurt you, did he?

25:22.489 --> 25:26.004
- Thank God. If that fucking mongrel...
- Um, he said to tell you

25:26.010 --> 25:28.025
that if you don't pay up,

25:28.996 --> 25:31.220
you're a dead man.

25:31.226 --> 25:35.416
Fuck me. Vera, I am so sorry.

25:35.422 --> 25:40.090
Mm-mm, so then I started thinking
about what Will had been saying.

25:40.096 --> 25:41.296
(sighs)

25:41.996 --> 25:44.525
- That man is a drug dealer, isn't he?
- No.

25:44.785 --> 25:48.482
God, Vera, no. You've got
this all wrong. He's a...

25:48.488 --> 25:49.824
(sighs)

25:49.830 --> 25:52.933
Look, you're probably right. I...
I think he might be a criminal,

25:52.939 --> 25:56.655
but I didn't know it at
the time. It's not drugs.

25:56.661 --> 25:57.911
He...

25:58.366 --> 25:59.679
(sighing) I...

26:00.501 --> 26:03.392
I needed money fast,
for the micro-brewery

26:03.398 --> 26:05.214
and... and... and...

26:05.471 --> 26:09.158
(sighs) he's a... a dodgy loan shark.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.829
He is, trust me.

26:12.853 --> 26:14.057
I don't...

26:16.048 --> 26:18.045
I don't know if I believe you.

26:18.051 --> 26:19.501
Well, I...

26:20.158 --> 26:22.652
I can't tell you what to believe.

26:22.658 --> 26:23.858
Mm.

26:25.073 --> 26:27.265
I can only tell you the truth.

26:31.065 --> 26:33.077
And it is the truth.

26:35.229 --> 26:36.737
So why don't you pay him back?

26:36.743 --> 26:40.014
Well, when the first one fell over
I was hoping to get another one,

26:40.628 --> 26:43.115
like, fast, and... (sighs)

26:44.982 --> 26:47.303
(hushed) Vera, I am so sorry.

26:47.309 --> 26:49.873
Well, how did he even find you?
Did you give him this address?

26:49.879 --> 26:52.595
No! Of course I didn't give
him this address. He's...

26:52.785 --> 26:54.621
he, the guy's connected.

26:54.711 --> 26:57.637
Please, Vera, you have to believe me.

26:57.643 --> 27:00.857
I am sorry, Vera. I will sort this out.

27:00.863 --> 27:03.773
- Okay? I'll fix this, I promise.
- (sobbing)

27:06.450 --> 27:08.331
(sniffling and whimpering)

27:09.024 --> 27:10.511
- Oh.
- (sobbing)

27:12.006 --> 27:14.109
I really care about you, Vera.

27:15.734 --> 27:18.734
(pulsating dramatic music)

27:21.896 --> 27:23.623
You motherfucker!

27:23.726 --> 27:25.648
I told you I had a problem at work!

27:25.654 --> 27:27.912
You do not come to my fucking house!

27:27.918 --> 27:29.849
(laughing) You need
to settle, Jakey boy.

27:29.855 --> 27:33.045
- Your nuts'll explode.
- She's the fuckin' Governor, ya mong!

27:33.051 --> 27:34.755
That's your problem.

27:34.761 --> 27:37.358
Mate, you been smoking
too much of your own shit.

27:38.425 --> 27:39.865
Take your fuckin' money.

27:39.871 --> 27:43.358
Our little arrangement is over. I'm out.

27:45.542 --> 27:48.261
And don't you ever come near her again!

27:48.267 --> 27:52.305
She has got you all jizzed up,
hasn't she? So touching. (Laughing)

27:52.500 --> 27:57.581
See... the thing is, I'd
be crazy to turn my back

27:57.587 --> 28:00.508
on such a lucrative
customer base as Wentworth.

28:00.514 --> 28:03.141
See, those captive
markets are hard to find.

28:03.249 --> 28:07.632
Now, I may be a little
mad, but I'm not crazy.

28:07.934 --> 28:11.064
And you will be out
when I say you're out.

28:11.070 --> 28:13.935
Otherwise, you'll end
up in a fucking box.

28:19.770 --> 28:22.974
- So, what's it gonna be, huh?
- (clicking)

28:28.189 --> 28:30.986
- Fuckin' kill me if you want to.
- Hmm.

28:31.468 --> 28:32.781
I'm out.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.595
Ah!

28:35.601 --> 28:36.864
(laughs)

28:38.857 --> 28:41.178
(clicks)

28:41.184 --> 28:45.358
(laughs)

28:50.486 --> 28:52.841
Ah, yeah, prick!

28:55.351 --> 28:56.593
(flicks lighter closed)

28:56.859 --> 29:00.326
(slowly whooshing flourish)

29:02.418 --> 29:03.618
(music ends)

29:06.479 --> 29:07.801
You wanted to see me, sir?

29:08.176 --> 29:11.172
Ah, yeah, mate. Grab a seat.

29:11.597 --> 29:13.808
Just an informal chat
to bring you up to speed.

29:14.151 --> 29:15.652
How's the investigation going?

29:15.658 --> 29:19.064
Well, it seems like we got
a corrupt officer in the mix.

29:20.177 --> 29:21.551
Any idea who it is?

29:21.557 --> 29:24.685
Well, Mr Jackson, he held a
little, um, sting operation.

29:24.695 --> 29:28.527
Identified a hygiene services
worker as a possible conduit.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.824
- Right!
- Yeah, so we interviewed her

29:30.830 --> 29:33.131
and, uh, she rolled over, and
admitted there was an aborted

29:33.137 --> 29:35.449
attempt to bring the drugs into
the prison on the day of the sting.

29:35.455 --> 29:37.637
Okay. Why aborted?

29:37.643 --> 29:38.847
Oh, she was tipped off.

29:38.853 --> 29:41.138
Got a phone call an hour
prior to the supposed delivery.

29:41.144 --> 29:42.861
- We got the number.
- Right.

29:44.138 --> 29:46.326
- So you know it wasn't mine.
- No. No.

29:46.978 --> 29:49.870
No. In fact, it was a dead
end. Didn't match anyone here.

29:49.876 --> 29:51.386
What's called a burner mobile.

29:51.392 --> 29:53.909
Yeah, like a... an
unregistered pre-paid.

29:53.915 --> 29:56.280
Bingo. You're catching on.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.806
Interesting.

30:00.259 --> 30:01.994
So I saved the number.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
(uneasy undertone)

30:09.352 --> 30:14.679
(mobile vibrates)

30:15.323 --> 30:20.776
(mobile continues to vibrate)

30:21.310 --> 30:28.652
(vibrations and music intensifying)

30:29.268 --> 30:33.158
- (mobile vibrates)
- Well, well! Blow me down.

30:33.271 --> 30:36.418
(vibrations continue then cease)

30:37.240 --> 30:38.607
Fact is, son,

30:39.271 --> 30:41.271
there were whispers about you,

30:41.537 --> 30:43.783
back in your old Walford days.

30:45.706 --> 30:48.607
But you shot through
before the shit hit the fan.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.002
So there we have it.

30:50.008 --> 30:53.621
I'd say you're royally fucked.

30:57.201 --> 30:58.807
Are you gonna have me arrested?

31:01.208 --> 31:02.408
No.

31:06.599 --> 31:07.799
(music ends)

31:09.858 --> 31:12.138
I'm gonna make you an offer.

31:15.986 --> 31:18.859
One you'd be stupid to refuse.

31:20.669 --> 31:23.004
(jaunty music with drums)

31:23.289 --> 31:26.575
You can continue on with
your business, uninterrupted.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.526
But I want a 20% cut of the profits.

31:38.551 --> 31:39.751
(music ends)

31:45.502 --> 31:49.025
I could get used to
this, seein' ya every day.

31:49.213 --> 31:52.111
I could never get used to
it, not after what we had.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.922
But maybe I won't have to.

31:55.003 --> 31:56.697
What, you found something?

31:57.240 --> 32:01.935
Zoe Taylor ran a group counselling
course for people who suffer

32:01.941 --> 32:05.062
- from post-traumatic stress disorder.
- All right.

32:05.068 --> 32:07.850
Iman attended that course,

32:07.856 --> 32:11.141
"dealing with war-related,
refugee trauma,"

32:11.147 --> 32:14.124
- is how Zoe put it.
- So nothing to do with Pennisi?

32:14.130 --> 32:18.557
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Pennisi attended the same sessions

32:18.563 --> 32:21.190
- for burns trauma.
- Holy shit!

32:21.196 --> 32:24.986
Mm. They both attended for
a period of about 18 months.

32:24.992 --> 32:27.349
Oh, they knew each other all right.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.484
Iman lied to me.

32:30.038 --> 32:31.305
Mm-hmm.

32:31.531 --> 32:33.236
- (sighs)
- (door beeps unlocked)

32:34.796 --> 32:36.088
Thanks.

32:37.773 --> 32:40.609
I just saw Stewart come out
of a meeting with Channing.

32:40.904 --> 32:43.337
- And?
- He looked sick.

32:43.343 --> 32:46.592
- I think he's gone.
- Here's hoping.

32:46.693 --> 32:47.893
(door beeps unlocked)

32:55.903 --> 32:57.795
Why are you still here?

33:00.107 --> 33:01.897
- You're fighting a losing battle.
- WOMAN: (over PA) <i>Attention, compound.</i>

33:01.903 --> 33:05.321
<i>Attention, compound. The
canteen is now open for C Block.</i>

33:13.948 --> 33:16.707
(echoing drum beat flourish)

33:17.148 --> 33:18.348
(intriguing music)

33:18.354 --> 33:19.870
Fuck!

33:21.093 --> 33:23.362
- (echoing drum beat flourish)
- What are you doing in my cell?

33:23.565 --> 33:25.592
You stole this from me!

33:26.601 --> 33:29.899
And you lied to me about
Pennisi. You did know him.

33:29.905 --> 33:31.518
Yeah, I knew him.

33:31.686 --> 33:32.908
So stop fuckin' lying

33:32.914 --> 33:34.934
- and tell me what you knew about him.
- (whooshing and ringing flourish)

33:35.706 --> 33:38.229
- (whooshing flourish)
- (Franky gasps)

33:38.235 --> 33:40.408
- (frenetic music)
- Ho! Ha! No!

33:40.414 --> 33:42.893
- Argh! Argh!
- Argh!

33:43.081 --> 33:44.281
Argh!

33:44.369 --> 33:46.501
- Yeaww!
- Argh!

33:46.595 --> 33:48.298
Argh! Argh!

33:48.304 --> 33:50.517
(both exhaling sharply and grunting)

33:50.523 --> 33:51.964
- Argh!
- (both breathing heavily)

33:51.970 --> 33:53.170
Argh!

33:53.228 --> 33:54.428
Argh!

33:54.529 --> 33:56.787
- (Franky exclaims)
- You took him away from me.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.982
- (whooshing flourish)
- The only good thing I ever had.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.264
- Yaah!
- Yaah!

34:02.270 --> 34:03.470
- Argh!
- Ugh!

34:03.476 --> 34:05.311
(both breathing heavily and grunting)

34:05.317 --> 34:07.323
What are you talking about?!

34:08.487 --> 34:10.130
- (whooshing flourish)
- (echoing incoherent screaming)

34:10.136 --> 34:12.723
When he couldn't find work,
when he couldn't leave his house.

34:12.728 --> 34:14.107
(echoing incoherent screaming)

34:14.112 --> 34:16.501
- You were his girlfriend?!
- He was obsessed with you!

34:16.507 --> 34:17.706
(echoing incoherent screaming)

34:17.713 --> 34:20.005
He even had a shrine to
you all over the wall.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.022
(echoing) You don't touch this!

34:22.123 --> 34:24.520
- Ugh! Get off!
- Aagh! Get off!

34:24.525 --> 34:25.811
(drum beat flourish)

34:25.817 --> 34:28.632
- (whooshing whipping flourish)
- (Iman screams)

34:28.638 --> 34:29.838
Argh!

34:29.844 --> 34:32.077
(both struggling and breathing heavily)

34:32.083 --> 34:34.485
- You destroyed us!
- (echoing) Don't touch any of this!

34:34.492 --> 34:35.983
Mike is dead because of you.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.295
- I didn't kill Mike!
- No.

34:38.301 --> 34:39.596
(echoing) Mike?

34:39.683 --> 34:40.882
I did!

34:40.889 --> 34:42.679
Argh!

34:42.760 --> 34:45.543
(Franky exclaiming)

34:45.887 --> 34:47.393
- Oh!
- (echoing) No!

34:47.400 --> 34:49.425
Yaah! (Panting)

34:49.585 --> 34:51.301
- Dah!
- (echoing crying)

34:51.306 --> 34:53.106
- Argh!
- Argh!

34:53.699 --> 34:55.190
- (crying)
- (echoing crying)

34:55.197 --> 34:56.531
Don't do this!

34:57.277 --> 34:58.677
(frenetic drum beats)

34:58.800 --> 35:01.275
- It's the only reason I'm here.
- (Franky struggling)

35:01.281 --> 35:02.779
(Iman screams)

35:03.557 --> 35:04.757
(exhales)

35:04.763 --> 35:06.783
(both screaming)

35:06.789 --> 35:09.182
- Arrrrgh!
- (muffled) Argh!

35:09.188 --> 35:10.737
- FRANKY: Ah! (Gasps)
- (muffled scream from Iman)

35:10.906 --> 35:12.638
(grating whooshing flourish)

35:12.644 --> 35:14.439
(muffled screams)

35:14.445 --> 35:16.210
(Iman struggling and panting)

35:16.216 --> 35:17.624
Argh! (Moans)

35:17.630 --> 35:19.616
(Iman moaning)

35:19.796 --> 35:21.198
- (whooshing flourish)
- (Iman moans)

35:21.204 --> 35:22.732
- (bones cracking)
- (shivers) Ah!

35:22.738 --> 35:24.381
- (Iman panting)
- (Franky gasps)

35:24.387 --> 35:25.587
(Iman gasps)

35:25.593 --> 35:26.931
It was her.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.725
- She killed Pennisi!
- So I heard.

35:30.206 --> 35:32.237
- She could tell them it wasn't you.
- (Iman breathing heavily)

35:33.267 --> 35:35.422
But she won't be telling them anything.

35:36.276 --> 35:38.203
- (whooshing flourish)
- (bones cracking)

35:39.303 --> 35:40.503
(music quells)

35:40.509 --> 35:43.509
- (ominous undertone)
- (Franky gasps)

35:43.592 --> 35:46.413
(Franky exhales and gasps)

35:52.781 --> 35:55.122
(gasping)

35:55.920 --> 35:57.313
(breathes slowly)

35:57.679 --> 35:58.879
(breathes sharply)

35:59.906 --> 36:01.379
(breathes slowly)

36:04.802 --> 36:06.002
(gasps)

36:07.646 --> 36:08.846
(breathes sharply)

36:13.468 --> 36:14.668
(music ends)

36:14.950 --> 36:17.968
So, Francesca, you're claiming
this one was self-defence?

36:17.974 --> 36:19.976
- No.
- It wasn't self-defence?

36:19.982 --> 36:22.132
No. I fought Iman after
she attacked me with a shiv,

36:22.138 --> 36:24.301
but I didn't kill
her. That was Ferguson!

36:24.307 --> 36:27.940
- Joan Ferguson?
- Yes! Just check the CCTV.

36:27.946 --> 36:29.568
You can see her going into the cell.

36:29.574 --> 36:31.763
I think my client has been
quite clear about this.

36:31.769 --> 36:34.067
- Can we move on, please?
- Why did Iman attack you?

36:34.073 --> 36:37.437
- Iman was Mike Pennisi's girlfriend.
- Isn't that the guy you killed?

36:37.443 --> 36:39.554
- I didn't fuckin' kill him.
- You're yet to prove those charges,

36:39.560 --> 36:40.760
Detective.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.183
He was stalking me.

36:42.189 --> 36:44.670
He had a shrine of pictures
that he'd taken of me,

36:44.676 --> 36:47.678
all over his wall. She
got jealous, she shot him.

36:47.742 --> 36:49.157
With your gun?

36:49.703 --> 36:51.709
- A gun I'd previously handled.
- Yeah.

36:51.715 --> 36:54.386
So how did she get this
previously handled gun?

36:55.014 --> 36:57.315
He saw me dump it and he took it home.

36:57.321 --> 36:58.521
(scoffs)

36:58.527 --> 37:02.109
- That's an interesting story.
- I said he was stalking me!

37:02.115 --> 37:05.027
Well, it's just strange, isn't
it, that no one we questioned,

37:05.033 --> 37:06.530
friends, family, neighbours,

37:06.536 --> 37:08.422
no one mentioned that
Pennisi had a girlfriend?

37:08.428 --> 37:10.832
I'd be surprised, with a face like that.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.316
Basically, he was a recluse.

37:13.322 --> 37:15.234
There was no shrine, Francesca.

37:15.673 --> 37:17.076
Didn't exist.

37:19.055 --> 37:21.688
FERGUSON: Well, I returned
to my unit and, uh,

37:21.793 --> 37:24.865
I heard a... a commotion
from an adjoining cell.

37:24.871 --> 37:26.459
What sort of commotion?

37:27.241 --> 37:30.085
It sounded like a fight. Struggle.

37:32.561 --> 37:34.176
A strangled cry.

37:35.966 --> 37:37.555
And what happened then?

37:37.960 --> 37:41.125
Well, I went to Iman's
cell to investigate and I...

37:41.131 --> 37:45.300
I saw Doyle, standing over
Iman's body, on the floor.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.126
And she was dead?

37:48.778 --> 37:50.404
I assumed so, yes.

37:51.497 --> 37:54.497
Another inmate, Tina Mercado,
she arrived at the same time,

37:54.503 --> 37:56.317
and she... she pushed the panic button.

37:57.617 --> 37:59.232
She'll be able to verify the, uh...

37:59.238 --> 38:01.619
- the accuracy of my statement.
- Mm.

38:02.024 --> 38:04.509
(tense music)

38:04.515 --> 38:05.718
FRANKY: Fuck off!

38:05.724 --> 38:07.110
I didn't do it, so fuck off!

38:07.116 --> 38:09.602
- I didn't fucking do it!
- Oi, come on!

38:09.608 --> 38:11.118
(Franky exhales sharply and grunts)

38:11.743 --> 38:13.648
FRANKY: (muffled)
I didn't fuckin' kill Iman!

38:13.654 --> 38:15.359
- Ferguson did it!
- (cell door sliding and clanging)

38:15.711 --> 38:17.845
You know it was Ferguson!

38:17.851 --> 38:21.869
- MILES: Jesus Christ, Doyle, calm down.
- God, you know what she's capable of!

38:21.875 --> 38:23.869
- Get in there!
- Fuck!

38:23.875 --> 38:26.547
(echoing) You know
what she's capable of!

38:26.736 --> 38:29.033
You know she did!

38:29.346 --> 38:31.348
She's outta control!

38:31.354 --> 38:33.064
She's a freak!

38:33.941 --> 38:35.141
(exhales)

38:37.052 --> 38:39.276
CHANNING: What sort of a
shithouse is Vera running here?

38:39.282 --> 38:40.965
Those bitches are out of control.

38:41.087 --> 38:43.604
I can't believe Doyle would
do something like this, sir.

38:43.610 --> 38:45.502
Well, that's up to
the police to sort out.

38:45.508 --> 38:47.478
I've completed my investigation.

38:47.484 --> 38:50.835
That's great. So, ah, what are
you going to do about Mr Stewart?

38:50.841 --> 38:52.382
I found no evidence to support

38:52.388 --> 38:54.603
- any wrong-doing by Mr Stewart.
- Wait,

38:54.850 --> 38:56.178
you're kidding me, right?

38:56.184 --> 38:58.015
What about the hygiene services woman?

38:58.130 --> 39:01.146
Well, she couldn't identify any
of our officers as being involved.

39:01.152 --> 39:02.653
So what, he gets off scot-free?

39:02.659 --> 39:05.247
Will, look, I understand
in view of your...

39:05.335 --> 39:07.364
accusations, it might be awkward for you

39:07.370 --> 39:09.255
to remain under Jake as Deputy.

39:09.755 --> 39:11.411
So you going to transfer him?

39:11.906 --> 39:13.106
No.

39:13.530 --> 39:15.930
I was suggesting that you might

39:16.226 --> 39:17.936
want to consider a transfer.

39:19.218 --> 39:22.135
If it helps, I'd be more than
happy to fast-track it for you.

39:22.141 --> 39:23.646
I'll save you the trouble.

39:24.199 --> 39:25.574
- I'll resign.
- (ominous undertone)

39:31.801 --> 39:33.001
(music ends)

39:34.020 --> 39:35.422
Fuck the lot of them!

39:35.788 --> 39:38.135
You can't resign. That...
that just lets them win.

39:38.141 --> 39:39.932
It's... it's pointless.

39:40.447 --> 39:41.647
(sighs)

39:41.830 --> 39:44.049
I actually used to believe
in this shit, you know?

39:44.055 --> 39:47.455
The... the system, justice being
served, but there is no justice.

39:47.461 --> 39:50.347
And the system, it protects
the corrupt bastards!

39:50.457 --> 39:52.473
God, you sound like me.

39:53.464 --> 39:54.769
You wanna join the Red Right Hand?

39:54.775 --> 39:56.672
Oh, you know what? Maybe
you were right all along,

39:56.674 --> 39:59.847
because in your view of the world,
the right people got punished.

40:00.675 --> 40:02.005
And I wound up here.

40:02.011 --> 40:04.177
Yeah, but you're not propping
up a steaming turd. I've...

40:04.183 --> 40:07.742
- fuckin' had it!
- Listen, Will, you cannot resign.

40:07.748 --> 40:08.948
Whoa, shit!

40:08.954 --> 40:11.593
Fuck, I know you're
angry and disillusioned

40:11.599 --> 40:13.554
and at the end of your
tether right now, but with

40:13.560 --> 40:16.077
Stewart as Deputy Governor,

40:16.083 --> 40:17.867
and Ferguson as Top Dog,

40:17.873 --> 40:21.305
the women need you now more than ever!

40:21.311 --> 40:25.219
They can find another mug,
okay? 'Cause it's fuckin' futile!

40:27.781 --> 40:29.415
I need you.

40:30.086 --> 40:32.534
Will, look at me.

40:36.822 --> 40:38.630
I need to know

40:39.723 --> 40:43.360
that there is at least one good guy

40:44.145 --> 40:47.275
on the other side of those bars.

40:52.752 --> 40:54.236
(whooshing flourish)

40:55.555 --> 40:58.049
- (rushing warping flourish)
- -

40:58.973 --> 41:00.480
Hey, Tina!

41:00.486 --> 41:03.277
You know the screws reckon
Doyle snapped Iman's neck.

41:03.283 --> 41:05.725
Yeah, Franky's fuckin' psycho!

41:05.731 --> 41:09.525
- Fuckin' mouth, ya silly cow!
- Hey, listen up! Everybody, shut up!

41:10.329 --> 41:12.704
Don't listen to bullshit rumours, okay?

41:12.710 --> 41:14.540
Franky didn't do this, I swear to God.

41:14.546 --> 41:16.239
- Oh, yeah, then who did, huh?
- Yeah?

41:16.245 --> 41:18.607
I don't fucking know. Maybe you did!

41:18.613 --> 41:20.384
- HUTCHINS: You're fuckin' nuts!
- ALLIE: Maybe she fuckin' did!

41:20.390 --> 41:22.269
- Who killed Iman?
- Yeah, well stop spreading bullshit

41:22.275 --> 41:24.382
- rumours about Franky.
- Don't fuckin' touch me!

41:24.388 --> 41:27.388
(twanging music with drums)

41:59.195 --> 42:01.429
(scoffing)

42:02.361 --> 42:04.958
Things are spinning out of
control. Can you feel it?

42:05.071 --> 42:06.271
(sighs)

42:08.361 --> 42:10.861
CHANNING: Vera, your management
is in a bit of a state.

42:10.867 --> 42:13.218
Drugs, assaults, murders.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.117
I'm gonna have to sideline you.

42:24.558 --> 42:27.366
And I'm gonna assume the
role of Acting Governor.

42:27.372 --> 42:30.372
(sombre music)

42:35.343 --> 42:37.348
(keys jangling)

42:46.762 --> 42:48.392
Francesca Doyle.

42:48.749 --> 42:53.255
I'm here to formally charge you
with the murder of Iman Farah.

42:53.261 --> 42:56.567
I must inform you that you do
not have to say or do anything,

42:56.573 --> 43:00.590
but anything you say or do
may be given in evidence.

43:25.288 --> 43:26.488
(door opening)

43:37.936 --> 43:39.931
Doyle's saying you killed Iman.

43:42.530 --> 43:44.533
- Fuck, Joan. Why?
- (music becoming ominous)

43:47.648 --> 43:49.885
It had the desired effect.

43:50.038 --> 43:52.148
- Vera being sidelined?
- (drum beats added to music)

43:53.943 --> 43:56.926
Everything is moving according to plan.

43:58.630 --> 44:00.533
All that remains

44:01.325 --> 44:04.634
is for me to deliver the coup de grâce.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.840
(whooshing flourish)

44:06.031 --> 44:07.471
(echoing drum beat flourish)

44:07.477 --> 44:08.810
(whooshing flourish)

44:11.039 --> 44:12.239
(music ends)
