¶¶

00:04.005 --> 00:06.505
(theme song playing)

00:08.943 --> 00:12.044
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.046 --> 00:14.546
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.548 --> 00:20.119
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:22.988
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>

00:22.990 --> 00:27.793
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.796
<i>¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:35.200
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:49.717 --> 00:52.251
-Mommy, look who it is!
-(cheering)

00:52.253 --> 00:54.887
(neighing)

00:56.490 --> 00:58.023
Pretty good likeness, huh?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.426
Well, if it isn't everyone's
favorite example

01:00.428 --> 01:02.594
of equine excellence.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.329
Good morning, Maximus.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.565
It's Max!
(gasps) All right!

01:08.369 --> 01:12.304
Ooh, Maxie, lookin' spry
and svelte today!

01:15.009 --> 01:16.875
-(cheering)
-(Rapunzel laughs)

01:16.877 --> 01:19.578
Max, if this were
a popularity contest,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.346
you would come in first place.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.115
Or at least a close second.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.249
But I gotta say, Max,

01:24.251 --> 01:25.417
that mane is lookin' great.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.785
(whinnies)

01:27.588 --> 01:29.421
And that's comin' from someone
who knows good hair.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.857
Max wants to look his best.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.959
He's got an important
assignment coming up.

01:33.961 --> 01:36.628
Pulling the armored cart
to the depository.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.264
Wow!
The depository!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.767
Where they keep
all the kingdom's money!

01:41.769 --> 01:43.469
Hey, didn't we try
to rob that place once?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.637
You know, I don't have
any specific recollections,

01:45.639 --> 01:49.475
but if it's a place with money,
I'm gonna go with yes.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.477
Woman:
Stop! Thief!

01:51.479 --> 01:52.778
Look! There!

01:58.886 --> 02:01.053
Max? You know what to do.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.721
(neighing)

02:07.428 --> 02:09.561
Good old Max! Hm?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.970
(whinnying)

02:19.740 --> 02:20.906
(giggles)

02:20.908 --> 02:22.641
(cheering)

02:22.643 --> 02:24.576
Onlooker:
Would you look at that?
That horse...

02:26.847 --> 02:28.080
(whinnying)

02:29.984 --> 02:31.450
Whoa!

02:31.452 --> 02:33.685
(whinnying)

02:33.687 --> 02:34.953
Brilliantly done!

02:34.955 --> 02:37.422
I have never seen
such an impressive horse.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.358
(dismayed noises)

02:39.360 --> 02:41.860
Aw, what's your name,
big fella?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.962
O-at Bag.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.798
What? O-at Bag
was my mother's name.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.967
No.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.802
His name is Axel.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.204
Where's your owner, Axel?

02:52.206 --> 02:53.539
(sad grumble)

02:53.541 --> 02:55.274
You're all alone?

02:55.276 --> 02:56.708
(grunting)

02:56.710 --> 02:59.778
Oh well, you can stay
at the castle tonight.

02:59.780 --> 03:04.016
Yes you can.
Tomorrow we're gonna
find you a good home.

03:04.018 --> 03:07.286
Yep.
A horse like this will have
no problem finding an owner.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.387
In the meantime, Max,

03:08.389 --> 03:10.489
why don't you show
your new best pal around?

03:10.491 --> 03:13.559
-(whinnies)
-(grunt)

03:13.561 --> 03:15.127
(whinnying)

03:19.500 --> 03:22.401
Uh, guys? Guys?

03:22.403 --> 03:24.403
Okay!
Don't worry about us.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.704
We'll take him in.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.639
Or, you can
let me go.

03:27.641 --> 03:28.840
Can it, Dwayne.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.942
All right.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.285
(angry neighing)

03:44.592 --> 03:45.591
(Max neighs)

03:48.529 --> 03:49.928
(grunts)

03:51.332 --> 03:52.497
(surprised grunt)

03:56.503 --> 03:58.904
-What is this?
-Come on, Max.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.606
Max, what is this?

04:00.608 --> 04:02.374
That was a huge
pile of apples!

04:02.376 --> 04:04.576
No, Max,
this is not the way.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.445
Yeah, that's not
gonna do it, either.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.485
(romantic music playing)

04:30.804 --> 04:32.704
-(surprised grunt)
-Okay!

04:32.706 --> 04:35.874
Who tore up
my plumbagos?

04:35.876 --> 04:36.908
(guilty neigh)

04:36.910 --> 04:39.378
(whinnying)

04:55.062 --> 04:56.561
(frustrated grunt)

04:59.433 --> 05:00.832
(whinnying)

05:00.834 --> 05:03.435
Axel!
You look well-rested.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.605
I'm glad it hasn't taken you
very long to get comfortable
around here.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.606
(laughs)

05:07.608 --> 05:09.775
Well, good morning,
sleepyhead.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.344
Look who's already up.
Your pal, Axel.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.645
(grumble)

05:13.647 --> 05:15.514
Oh, there you are, Max.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.149
I've been looking for you.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.017
I know you're aware
of our intention

05:19.019 --> 05:20.852
to find Axel
a home today.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.621
But after some
serious thought,

05:22.623 --> 05:24.623
I've made a slight
change of plans.

05:24.625 --> 05:27.626
In light of Axel's
impressive show yesterday,

05:27.628 --> 05:29.928
and seeing how inseparable
you two have become,

05:29.930 --> 05:33.131
I've decided Axel
is just what we need
around here.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.435
Maximus, meet the newest horse
on the royal guard.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.136
(shocked squeak)

05:38.138 --> 05:39.938
(grunts)

05:42.710 --> 05:44.609
(grunting)

05:48.882 --> 05:50.449
There you guys are.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.685
So Max, are you excited
Axel's joining the force?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.522
Huh.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.525
"Before gaining acceptance
to the Royal Guard,

06:00.527 --> 06:04.563
"every man, woman, or horse
must pass a series of tests

06:04.565 --> 06:08.633
<i> designed to measure</i>
<i> his or her qualifications."</i>

06:08.635 --> 06:10.836
Okay, Max was right.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.038
I may have been premature
in awarding you a spot

06:13.040 --> 06:14.506
on the Royal Guard,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.975
but pass these tests
and you're in.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.046
That Axel's some horse,
huh, Max?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.981
He's a lot like you,
but younger.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.350
Oh, and bigger.
Like really-- (growls)

06:25.352 --> 06:27.319
I'm guessing that probably
means he's stronger, too?

06:27.321 --> 06:30.188
I think he's gonna
put on quite the show.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.224
Oh, yeah.
Pete, did you--

06:32.226 --> 06:34.760
did you polish
your helmet
for Axel?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.429
No. I bought a new one
this morning, so--

06:37.431 --> 06:38.764
(irritated grunt)

06:39.733 --> 06:42.334
Let the testing begin!

06:42.336 --> 06:43.835
(grunting)

06:43.837 --> 06:46.505
Okay, Axel,
stand on your hind legs,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.306
and we'll see how high
you can reach.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.777
(onlookers exclaim)

06:51.779 --> 06:52.878
Pete:
Did he just break Max's record?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.780
Oh-ho! He just broke
Max's record!

06:54.782 --> 06:57.783
I can't believe it!
I didn't think anyone
would break that record!

06:57.785 --> 06:58.583
(angry neighing)

06:58.585 --> 06:59.818
(grunting)

07:01.288 --> 07:03.688
Max!
What are you doing?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.257
You're already
on the guard.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.899
Impressive strength.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.934
(grunting)

07:17.871 --> 07:20.705
Wow, way to go!
I knew it!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.445
Max!
Take it easy!

07:27.815 --> 07:28.713
Aaaah!

07:28.715 --> 07:30.782
-(loud crash)
-(groans)

07:32.719 --> 07:34.052
(sighs)

07:35.122 --> 07:36.588
(whinnies)

07:36.590 --> 07:37.656
(cheering)

07:37.658 --> 07:39.591
(grunting)

07:39.593 --> 07:40.659
(neighing)

07:47.501 --> 07:48.567
(thud)

07:48.569 --> 07:51.069
-Ooh.
-Not too good, Max.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.505
(out of breath)

07:53.507 --> 07:55.140
Hey Pete,
your helmet's dented!

07:55.142 --> 07:57.409
(gasps)
Don't let Axel
see me this way!

07:57.411 --> 08:00.445
Well, at least Axel
made a good showing today.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.649
Congratulations.
You are now a member
of the Royal Guard.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.284
Really, Max,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.653
you don't have to be
the best at everything.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.589
Yeah! 'Cause Axel is.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.701
Well, well, well.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.338
Looks like
we have an old-fashioned
horse challenge here.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.373
(cheering and whinnying)

08:28.375 --> 08:29.841
I'm sorry, what?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.813
First one to make it around
Old Man's Bend

08:34.815 --> 08:38.617
and reach that tree
on the other side
of the ravine wins.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.720
Now, ready?
(blowing whistle)

08:42.823 --> 08:44.556
(cheering)

08:51.231 --> 08:53.231
-They're past the bend!
-Come on!

08:59.673 --> 09:00.906
(grunting and neighing)

09:01.875 --> 09:03.108
(neighing)

09:04.912 --> 09:06.144
(grunts)

09:10.250 --> 09:13.151
(cheering)

09:13.153 --> 09:14.452
Where's Max?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.556
(sigh)

09:21.728 --> 09:26.197
Cheer up, buddy.
So maybe you didn't
put your best foot--

09:26.199 --> 09:28.567
excuse me, hoof,
forward today,

09:28.569 --> 09:31.236
but, as far as I'm concerned,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.705
you are still the best horse
in the kingdom.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.839
(squeaks)

09:35.876 --> 09:39.077
Max!
Just the horse
I wanted to see.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.845
I'm worried about you, buddy.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.681
You haven't
been yourself lately.

09:42.683 --> 09:46.751
I think you're overworked,
and sometimes us old-timers
could use a break,

09:46.753 --> 09:48.219
so I wanna lighten your load.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.856
Axel can handle the trip
to the depository tomorrow.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.959
A little rest
will be good for you.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.027
(grumble)

10:00.367 --> 10:03.034
(neighing)

10:19.987 --> 10:23.021
("Wedding March" plays)

10:23.957 --> 10:26.625
(distressed neighing)

10:42.976 --> 10:46.678
Axel,
with the arrest of all
these bad guys,

10:46.680 --> 10:49.914
you have proven yourself
the most valuable horse
in all the land.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.585
You can have Max's job
and Maximus' stable.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.521
In fact, you can have
Maximus' name.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.660
I hereby dub thee
Maxelmus!

11:01.662 --> 11:04.095
Whatever happened
to the old Maximus?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.264
I'm sure he found
something to do.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.267
-But does it really matter?
-It sure doesn't!

11:10.203 --> 11:11.870
(child wailing)

11:13.974 --> 11:16.207
(tisking)

11:16.209 --> 11:19.110
Worst. Horse. Ever.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.012
(words echoing)

11:49.309 --> 11:54.145
(sniffing)

11:58.051 --> 12:00.652
(sniffing)

12:17.704 --> 12:20.905
This is why
you woke me up, Maximus?

12:20.907 --> 12:23.174
(whinnying)

12:31.952 --> 12:34.018
(whinnying)

12:36.857 --> 12:40.258
What?
You think Axel
is stealing money?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.294
Max, he's loading the cart
for his mission tomorrow.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.797
He's taking initiative.
Like a good horse!

12:45.799 --> 12:48.900
And now he's gotta
pick up all these coins,
thanks to you!

12:48.902 --> 12:49.934
Good night.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.403
Poor Axel.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.605
Max.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.444
(whinnying)

12:59.446 --> 13:02.814
Hey, hey!
What is going on with you?

13:02.816 --> 13:05.717
Leave Axel alone.

13:05.719 --> 13:09.120
I'm going back to bed,
and you need to do the same.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.625
Now...

13:22.602 --> 13:25.570
(dog barking)

13:26.973 --> 13:28.239
(grunt)

13:31.978 --> 13:36.014
Hiya, Max!
Pretty good likeness
of Axel, huh?

13:36.016 --> 13:39.150
Wow! This is the best
candy horse ever!

13:39.152 --> 13:41.469
Too good to eat.

13:41.470 --> 13:43.787
Guys! Check this out.
Axel signed my forehead!

13:43.790 --> 13:46.291
How cool is that?

13:46.293 --> 13:47.992
You can't grow a mustache,
that's my thing.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.427
Why can't we both be
'stache guys?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.096
Listen, I wanted to tell you,
you can't grow a mustache.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.365
-No, I'm telling you--
-No, no, no, it looks
really bad.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.037
(thunder rumbles )

14:02.442 --> 14:04.242
(thunder cracking)

14:21.194 --> 14:22.694
(surprised grunt)

14:33.173 --> 14:35.039
(floor collapses)

14:36.977 --> 14:39.010
(whinnying)

14:39.012 --> 14:40.912
(laughing grunts)

14:44.718 --> 14:46.818
(whinnying)

14:50.690 --> 14:53.524
Max has no reason
to dislike Axel.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.494
Or... does he?

14:56.496 --> 14:59.264
Back in the orphanage,
we had a hopscotch court.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.698
I was the best.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.568
I could hop, I could skip,
I could jump.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.337
(chuckles)
No one could out-scotch me.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.874
They used to call me
the "sweet feet champ"!

15:09.876 --> 15:12.277
-You remember that, Eugene?
-I remember you called yourself
the "sweet feet--

15:12.279 --> 15:13.578
(mutters)

15:13.580 --> 15:14.846
The important thing is,

15:14.848 --> 15:16.180
someone did.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.949
The other kids loved me.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.183
It was wonderful.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.786
Until... she showed up.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.289
We just knew her as...
Big Hops.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.225
She could go from one to 10
in a single bound.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.427
I grew to despise her.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.629
Because once Big Hops
hit the scene,

15:31.631 --> 15:35.600
it was like...
Sweet Feet never existed.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.770
(high squeaky voice)
I need to be alone!

15:38.772 --> 15:42.907
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but that actually made sense.
Lance is right.

15:42.909 --> 15:46.311
Max is a good,
honest, loyal horse,

15:46.313 --> 15:49.280
and just because
some new horse
came into town

15:49.282 --> 15:52.317
doesn't make him
any less special.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.485
(sigh)
I-- I better go apologize.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.324
He was a wizard
on that hopscotch court.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.732
Huh. I wonder where Max is?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.234
Hey...

16:11.771 --> 16:12.904
Axel?

16:12.906 --> 16:14.806
(gasp)
Those two are partners!

16:14.808 --> 16:17.342
The whole arrest
was a setup!

16:17.344 --> 16:18.576
Max?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.346
(gasp)

16:21.348 --> 16:22.747
Oh, no!

16:25.919 --> 16:27.685
Officer!
What are you doin'
down here?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.487
(grunting)

16:29.489 --> 16:32.156
You're relieving us?
But our shift isn't
over until--

16:32.158 --> 16:35.360
(shushing)
If the horse wants
to relieve us...

16:35.362 --> 16:37.362
Till five minutes ago.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.364
(chuckling)
There ya go!

16:39.366 --> 16:41.316
Yes!

16:41.317 --> 16:43.267
That's the great thing
about horse guards.
They can't tell time.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.803
Pete:
That's right! That's why
they don't have pocket watches.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.271
Or pockets.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.073
(grunts)

16:51.778 --> 16:52.844
Axel!

16:52.846 --> 16:55.279
Ma'am, he made it.

16:55.281 --> 16:59.417
Of course he did.
Hello, Axel.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.321
Yahh! Hahh!

17:03.323 --> 17:06.657
Ughhh-- How do I get you
out of here, Max?

17:06.659 --> 17:10.061
-(sighing)
-(Pascal squeaking)

17:10.063 --> 17:11.863
(gasp)
Good idea.

17:14.968 --> 17:17.668
Oh, Max?
I've got your favorite!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.038
Shiny red deliciousness!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.407
And, jump!

17:25.178 --> 17:27.045
(quiet grunt)

17:28.415 --> 17:30.381
(sigh)

17:30.383 --> 17:33.017
You know, Max?
When Axel showed up,

17:33.019 --> 17:38.222
we thought his size,
his strength, his speed,

17:38.224 --> 17:41.259
all made him
the perfect horse.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.995
But we forgot
the most important thing...

17:43.997 --> 17:45.696
his heart.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.567
Max...
you would do anything
for Corona

17:49.569 --> 17:52.336
to protect its name,
and more importantly,

17:52.338 --> 17:53.838
its people.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.774
No other horse
has half the heart you do.

17:56.776 --> 18:00.011
I am so sorry
I didn't believe you.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.346
(grunting)

18:03.416 --> 18:06.350
Aw, Max.
Now, come on.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.553
(bump)

18:08.555 --> 18:10.121
What do you say
we catch ourselves a horse?

18:10.123 --> 18:11.189
Huh?

18:14.427 --> 18:17.528
-(neighs)
-Oh! That's it, Max!

18:17.530 --> 18:20.631
Okay... I don't know
what Axel's up to

18:20.633 --> 18:22.533
or even know
where he is.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.369
But I do know
where<i> he</i> is!

18:32.445 --> 18:34.345
(grunts)

18:41.888 --> 18:44.222
Oh! There's been a breakout!

18:45.325 --> 18:47.925
(neighing)

18:47.927 --> 18:49.760
Where are the guards?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.096
And why didn't anyone
sound the alarm?

18:52.098 --> 18:54.599
Mm. These are delicious.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.100
Axel's the best.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.338
(grunts)

19:03.776 --> 19:07.512
Come on out.
We are finally free!

19:07.514 --> 19:10.314
(grunting)

19:10.316 --> 19:14.285
Nice work, Axel.
You always were
my favorite horse.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.820
(neighing)

19:15.822 --> 19:18.289
And I'm your favorite
thief, right?

19:18.291 --> 19:20.858
No.<i> I'm</i> my favorite thief.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.395
Ta-ta, King Frederic!
I bid you adieu!

19:28.168 --> 19:29.500
What the--?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.435
Looks like we've got company.

19:31.437 --> 19:34.372
Axel, show 'em
what a real horse can do.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.383
There he is, Max!
Come on!

19:49.556 --> 19:52.456
Well! If it isn't
the pathetic princess

19:52.458 --> 19:54.192
and her second-rate steed.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.861
Huh! Huhh!

19:56.863 --> 19:59.630
Just keep chasing him, Max!

19:59.632 --> 20:01.365
Uuh!

20:02.502 --> 20:05.036
Don't worry, Lady Caine!
I'm-- Ooof!

20:05.038 --> 20:08.406
Sorry, Dwayne.
Time to lose the deadweight!

20:08.408 --> 20:09.740
Aaah!

20:09.742 --> 20:11.375
Oooh!

20:11.377 --> 20:13.911
Aah-- Ooh!
I'm okay, Max!

20:13.913 --> 20:15.546
Get the other two!

20:23.022 --> 20:24.822
Faster, Axel!

20:27.193 --> 20:29.594
Oh, no, what are you doing?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.862
I'm not deadweight!
You traitor!

20:31.864 --> 20:33.898
(gasp)

20:33.900 --> 20:35.266
Ohhh! No--

20:41.908 --> 20:43.608
(breathing heavily)

20:43.610 --> 20:46.110
You saved my life.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.212
You know,
if you're lookin' for a job,

20:48.214 --> 20:49.780
I just happen
to be in the market for a new--

20:49.782 --> 20:50.948
Ohh!

20:50.950 --> 20:53.084
This is getting old,
Dwayne.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.385
These two are covered.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.520
Max, You know what to do.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.596
(Max whinnying)

21:16.776 --> 21:18.943
(growling)

21:27.720 --> 21:29.120
(grumbles)

21:29.122 --> 21:30.288
(neighs)

21:30.290 --> 21:31.656
(grunts)

21:32.558 --> 21:34.492
Her other accomplice
is down there.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.628
Brilliantly done, Maximus!

21:37.630 --> 21:40.564
You are one of a kind!

21:40.566 --> 21:41.832
Nice job, Max!

21:41.834 --> 21:44.635
You really are the best horse
in the kingdom!

21:44.637 --> 21:46.337
(whinnying)

21:46.339 --> 21:48.572
It's good to have you back!

21:48.574 --> 21:52.143
Come on!
I think there's an apple cart
with your name on it!

21:52.145 --> 21:54.512
(whinnying)

21:56.683 --> 21:58.783
Now that is how you do it!

21:58.785 --> 22:01.085
Uh, guys?

22:01.087 --> 22:03.954
Dwayne (sighs):
Such a good horse.

22:03.956 --> 22:05.890
Lance:
Can it, Dwayne.

22:07.493 --> 22:10.628
(theme music playing)

22:10.630 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:15.766
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:15.768 --> 22:18.202
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.204 --> 22:20.338
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.340 --> 22:23.174
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.176 --> 22:25.676
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.678 --> 22:29.013
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:29.015 --> 22:32.550
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>

22:32.552 --> 22:34.018
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:34.020 --> 22:36.087
