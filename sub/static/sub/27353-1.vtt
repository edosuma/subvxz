01:57.042 --> 02:00.042
Mom, I feel sick.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.501
Clara!

02:06.751 --> 02:10.501
Clara, darling, come here.
What's wrong?

02:10.667 --> 02:13.209
Clara, please. Álex.

02:13.376 --> 02:14.751
Come here.

02:15.001 --> 02:18.751
Please, open your eyes, darling.
My love.

02:19.084 --> 02:21.376
Clara, please, I'm begging you,
open your eyes.

02:21.501 --> 02:22.459
- Garrido.
- Clara.

02:22.584 --> 02:24.626
- An ambulance... to my home.
- No.

02:25.084 --> 02:27.251
I don't know what's wrong.

02:27.417 --> 02:28.334
Clara!

02:28.501 --> 02:30.334
Why isn't she saying anything? Please!

02:30.834 --> 02:33.209
Wake up!

03:58.542 --> 04:00.501
Yes?

04:54.126 --> 04:57.542
- Here.
- What is this shit, Garrido?

04:57.709 --> 05:01.042
Three months without smelling of gin.
You've earned it.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.917
Are you trying to learn to cook?

05:03.126 --> 05:06.001
No, my wife made them.
Even the dog won't eat them.

05:12.792 --> 05:13.834
Jump or fall?

05:14.917 --> 05:16.667
They saw her jumping.

05:16.834 --> 05:19.834
It seems it isn't the first time
she's tried to kill herself.

05:22.459 --> 05:24.334
The poor woman.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.376
- Husband?
- Widow.

05:29.417 --> 05:31.334
Any other witness?

05:32.251 --> 05:34.501
Her son. He saw her falling.

05:35.542 --> 05:37.251
Tell me know when the judge arrives.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.792
When he got down here
his mother was still breathing.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.084
Inspector Santos.

05:44.792 --> 05:46.667
What's your name, son?

05:47.792 --> 05:49.417
Like that since we got here.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.376
Kid, do you hear me?

05:54.834 --> 05:57.667
I can't. I can't do it.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.792
Do what?

06:02.417 --> 06:05.376
- I can't.
- What is it you can't do?

06:30.251 --> 06:34.251
THE PACT

06:49.917 --> 06:52.459
Careful with the moles, OK?

06:53.001 --> 06:55.001
- Perpendicular, love.
- OK, mom!

07:01.042 --> 07:03.917
Tomorrow's the last day for
handing in the signed permit.

07:04.126 --> 07:05.917
Forget it, it's all been discussed.

07:06.917 --> 07:09.501
Mom, it's the end of year trip.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.626
Everyone's going.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.876
Yes, love,
but you're not like everyone.

07:14.084 --> 07:16.792
Well, if you let me,

07:17.001 --> 07:18.209
maybe I would be.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.876
No.
It's too long, you're not ready.

07:26.126 --> 07:29.209
Oh, no? Look,

07:30.626 --> 07:32.626
maybe I'm not the one who isn't ready.

07:47.376 --> 07:48.626
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

07:48.792 --> 07:51.876
- They really suit you.
- I love them. You shouldn't have.

07:52.084 --> 07:54.501
How is your father
managing on his own?

07:54.667 --> 07:57.084
Still getting used to it.
How's your little girl?

07:57.251 --> 08:00.126
My "little girl"? if only
she were still my "little girl"...

08:00.292 --> 08:02.876
- Here.
- What have you got for me today?

08:12.709 --> 08:15.876
Good morning, Mr. Navarro.
How are you?

08:16.584 --> 08:18.042
My name is Mónica Molero

08:18.209 --> 08:20.167
and I've been assigned
as your public defender.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.251
I'm going to do everything I can

08:22.417 --> 08:24.459
to offer you a fair defense.

08:24.876 --> 08:27.376
- I asked for a man.
- Excuse me?

08:27.501 --> 08:29.459
A woman won't defend me.

08:31.084 --> 08:34.708
I have no doubt
you'd prefer a man to defend you.

08:34.876 --> 08:36.126
Under age, if possible.

08:38.501 --> 08:40.208
Shall we begin?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.042
Take him away.

08:53.334 --> 08:55.667
I'll see to the paperwork.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.376
He doesn't deserve a lawyer like you.

09:05.876 --> 09:08.626
What do you want, Alex?
We know each other.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.917
- We have to talk about Clara.
- About Clara

09:12.251 --> 09:14.084
or the money you owe us?

09:14.251 --> 09:17.251
Don't worry about the money.
This week I get paid the overtime.

09:18.417 --> 09:20.417
- Clara rang me last night.
- And?

09:21.792 --> 09:23.292
She wants to live with me.

09:28.917 --> 09:30.501
Did you tell her she could?

09:30.667 --> 09:33.834
You want her to mature, don't you?
Let her make her own mistakes.

09:34.042 --> 09:35.501
Not a chance.

09:41.876 --> 09:44.709
Are you never going
to speak to me again?

09:47.792 --> 09:50.334
Clara, your grandfather's boat
is no place to live.

09:50.501 --> 09:52.376
It's barely afloat.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.792
What your father should do is buy
a normal house with foundations.

09:58.626 --> 10:00.751
- He'll fix it.
- Yeah.

10:00.917 --> 10:03.667
Do you know how long
I've been hearing that?

10:03.834 --> 10:05.167
Since you were born.

10:06.501 --> 10:09.042
Do you think I like being the bad cop?
No, I don't.

10:12.459 --> 10:13.834
Please.

10:14.917 --> 10:18.376
I can't bear it when we get angry
like this. Say something, please.

10:21.001 --> 10:24.042
Last night Fran Ortiz's mother
jumped from a ninth floor.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.167
What?

10:50.751 --> 10:51.751
Sweetheart,

10:52.917 --> 10:54.292
you have to eat.

11:04.584 --> 11:07.792
Don't forget, tomorrow
is the last day for handing it in.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.001
Fine. Be careful.

11:45.084 --> 11:46.001
I'm leaving!

11:47.251 --> 11:51.209
Love, I don't mind taking you.
Really, it's on my way.

11:51.376 --> 11:52.542
I do.

12:04.417 --> 12:05.584
Clara!

12:11.251 --> 12:13.584
- What are you doing?
- It's my mother's car.

12:16.084 --> 12:17.751
Get in.

12:34.334 --> 12:35.542
Clara?

12:42.834 --> 12:44.126
Clara?

12:50.417 --> 12:51.501
Clara!

13:35.084 --> 13:38.501
Her phone is switched off.
I can't trace her.

13:50.501 --> 13:51.626
Hello?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.584
What?

13:56.709 --> 13:57.917
No!

14:04.834 --> 14:07.792
We don't know how long
she's been in a diabetic coma.

14:08.001 --> 14:10.001
The reaction time is vital.

14:11.042 --> 14:12.251
I'm sorry.

14:13.709 --> 14:15.084
Will she get better?

14:16.001 --> 14:18.042
I don't want to give you false hopes.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.834
The possibility of her waking up
some day is unlikely.

14:26.334 --> 14:28.209
Unlikely but not impossible.

14:29.792 --> 14:32.417
In my 30 years as a doctor
I've seen other patients

14:32.542 --> 14:34.459
in Clara's state,

14:34.584 --> 14:37.042
and I've never seen
any of them wake up.

14:50.626 --> 14:51.709
Again.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.459
Why? I don't understand.

14:57.876 --> 15:02.584
Garrido took a statement from the kids
who found her in the old cement works.

15:02.751 --> 15:06.251
She was on the ground,
with no phone, no backpack...

15:06.417 --> 15:08.042
Probably a mugging.

15:10.251 --> 15:11.876
What was she doing there?

15:16.126 --> 15:18.667
- I shouldn't have left her on her own.
- Mónica...

15:18.834 --> 15:20.126
No.

15:21.834 --> 15:23.792
I should have gone with her.
I knew it.

15:26.376 --> 15:27.584
My little girl.

15:29.876 --> 15:31.167
My little girl.

15:32.876 --> 15:35.667
If she doesn't wake up,
I'll never forgive myself.

16:42.834 --> 16:46.209
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.334
We're in the same class.

16:51.084 --> 16:52.876
My mother is in here too.

16:54.501 --> 16:55.417
Fran Ortiz?

16:57.084 --> 16:59.126
Clara mentioned you.

17:00.501 --> 17:02.084
How's your mother?

17:08.041 --> 17:09.376
Will she get better?

17:14.001 --> 17:15.209
I'll be back soon.

17:16.416 --> 17:17.791
Could you take care of her?

17:18.709 --> 17:19.709
Yes.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.667
1 NEW MESSAGE

18:20.251 --> 18:21.334
LOCATION

18:21.501 --> 18:23.417
I'LL BE LATE, HEAT UP SUPPER

18:44.209 --> 18:45.417
Fran...

18:51.792 --> 18:54.042
Why have you got her phone?

18:59.709 --> 19:01.667
Put that down.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.626
Put that down, Fran.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.167
Don't do anything stupid.

19:07.334 --> 19:08.459
Save her.

19:09.751 --> 19:13.209
- What?
- If you want Clara to live,

19:13.376 --> 19:15.501
you can't tell anyone
what you'll see there.

19:16.751 --> 19:18.542
Go to that place and save her.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.417
I couldn't... I can't...

19:22.709 --> 19:25.376
Did he do anything to you?
Monica, are you all right?

19:40.209 --> 19:41.417
Mind your head.

19:48.626 --> 19:51.459
I can have them take you home.
You should rest.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.917
No. I'll stay here
till they throw me out.

19:58.876 --> 20:00.292
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:32.334 --> 20:35.626
Ma'am,
I'm sorry but you should go now.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.584
Keeping quiet won't help you.

20:47.626 --> 20:51.042
We've found your prints on her things
and on your mother's car.

20:56.876 --> 20:59.751
Fran, we know you tried to kill her.

21:00.042 --> 21:03.167
Tell us why and the judge will take
your collaboration into account.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.459
Well,

21:10.501 --> 21:11.542
as you wish.

21:13.584 --> 21:16.209
I'm in as much of a hurry as you are.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.126
I knew she'd try again.

21:23.751 --> 21:24.584
Try what?

21:25.251 --> 21:26.126
My mother.

21:26.376 --> 21:29.751
A month ago she slit her wrists.
In the hospital the tall man

21:29.917 --> 21:32.459
told me she'd try again.
But she didn't have to die.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.876
That's why I went there,
in case she did it again.

21:35.876 --> 21:38.417
Where's there?
Where did you go, Fran?

21:38.542 --> 21:42.001
That man was right. She's alive.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.459
She jumped from a ninth floor
and she's alive.

21:44.584 --> 21:47.084
Now, someone has to die.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.251
I've run out of time.

22:00.876 --> 22:01.542
No.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.292
No, please, no!

22:04.709 --> 22:05.751
No!

22:06.042 --> 22:08.001
No! No, please, no!

22:08.167 --> 22:09.417
Calm down, Fran.

22:10.834 --> 22:13.251
No, I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!

22:13.417 --> 22:14.501
Fran, where...?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.751
Fran, where did you go? Fran, where?

22:19.126 --> 22:21.209
- What's wrong with him?
- Fran.

22:21.876 --> 22:22.917
Fran!

22:24.251 --> 22:25.542
Get a doctor, quick!

22:26.084 --> 22:27.292
What's wrong with you?

22:28.292 --> 22:29.501
Fran! Fran!

22:29.876 --> 22:30.917
Fran!

25:28.209 --> 25:29.376
Is anyone there?

25:31.334 --> 25:32.709
Can I help you?

25:47.292 --> 25:48.917
How did you find me?

25:50.042 --> 25:51.751
Who told you about me?

25:57.626 --> 26:00.917
I'm sorry. This is a mistake,
I shouldn't have come here.

26:01.126 --> 26:02.376
I can save her.

26:14.167 --> 26:16.292
She doesn't have to die.

26:19.751 --> 26:21.667
What do you know about me?

26:21.834 --> 26:24.792
If you're here
it's because only I can help you.

26:30.917 --> 26:34.126
- How?
- That isn't the question.

26:34.292 --> 26:37.376
What matters is, what would you be
willing to do not to lose her?

26:40.292 --> 26:41.542
Anything.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.626
Then she can be saved,

26:46.042 --> 26:47.501
but the price is high.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.084
How much?

26:57.084 --> 26:58.626
I don't want your money.

27:00.084 --> 27:02.709
You'll pay... but in due time.

27:05.126 --> 27:07.292
For now, I just want one thing.

27:10.084 --> 27:12.167
Your worst nightmare.

27:19.251 --> 27:20.126
Clara?

27:20.417 --> 27:21.167
Wake up!

27:22.084 --> 27:23.834
Wake up, please! No!

27:27.167 --> 27:27.917
Perfect.

27:30.542 --> 27:32.292
We can begin.

28:25.001 --> 28:26.709
You have nothing to lose.

30:12.167 --> 30:14.251
- Yes?
- <i>Mónica, where are you?</i>

30:14.417 --> 30:16.501
- At home.
- <i>The hospital called.</i>

30:16.667 --> 30:20.001
- What's happened?
- <i>They want to see us. Hurry.</i>

31:20.167 --> 31:22.626
<i>I've never seen anything like this.</i>

31:22.792 --> 31:24.334
<i>Clara's case is like a miracle.</i>

31:25.542 --> 31:28.292
- A miracle?
- One in a million.

31:28.459 --> 31:31.834
I've spoken to other colleagues.
No one has seen anything like this.

31:33.667 --> 31:35.126
When can she come home?

31:36.209 --> 31:38.584
We'll keep her in observation
for 24 hours.

31:38.751 --> 31:41.709
If she continues like this,
you can take her home soon.

31:42.792 --> 31:43.917
Just one thing...

31:45.001 --> 31:48.542
Clara doesn't remember
anything about what happened.

31:48.709 --> 31:50.626
That's the best thing for now.

32:09.501 --> 32:10.917
I'm going to work, sweetheart.

32:12.251 --> 32:13.626
Look after mom.

32:34.001 --> 32:36.001
I'll speak to the inspector.

32:36.167 --> 32:39.709
I'll ask for a few days, at least
until everything gets back to normal.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.459
Are you all right?

32:44.876 --> 32:47.376
A bit tired. That's all.

32:49.042 --> 32:51.209
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

32:51.376 --> 32:54.501
- Call me if you need anything.
- OK.

33:13.834 --> 33:14.876
Ma'am,

33:15.084 --> 33:17.917
if your purse isn't in Lost Property,
I don't think you'll find it.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.126
I just want to make sure
it isn't there.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.459
I don't know where else to look.
Can we keep going?

33:23.584 --> 33:24.501
Sure.

33:26.584 --> 33:27.459
There.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.876
There's your purse.
Will I fast forward?

33:34.376 --> 33:35.584
No, please.

33:51.042 --> 33:54.501
- Are you sure this is from last night?
- Yes, of course.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.042
- What's wrong?
- A power cut.

34:35.917 --> 34:39.376
Ma'am, you didn't leave the bag here.
I'm sorry.

35:41.001 --> 35:41.667
Clara.

35:43.459 --> 35:46.126
Are you all right? Let's go to...

36:04.792 --> 36:07.126
- How did last night go?
- Fine.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.876
NEW CASE OF THE "ALBINO SPIDER"

36:38.542 --> 36:40.542
ALBINO SPIDER

36:49.584 --> 36:53.251
THE ALBINO SPIDER ARRIVES IN SPAIN

36:55.459 --> 36:58.459
3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR SAVING HER

37:01.042 --> 37:02.042
A MACABRE RITUAL...

37:05.251 --> 37:10.501
SUSPECT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER
DURING HIS ARREST IN ARMENGOU ST.

37:53.584 --> 37:55.001
Ángel?

37:56.792 --> 37:58.501
Ángel Martos?

38:00.667 --> 38:04.334
I'm sorry to bother you. I wanted
to speak to you for a moment.

38:04.501 --> 38:06.167
Just a few questions.

38:07.584 --> 38:09.292
About what?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.001
May I?

38:27.667 --> 38:29.751
This is the last photo I took of her.

38:31.292 --> 38:35.084
The doctors couldn't do anything more
for her. But I could.

38:35.251 --> 38:37.876
- So I did it.
- What did you do?

38:39.626 --> 38:42.209
Only he could save her,
that's what he told me.

38:43.251 --> 38:46.376
I didn't believe in those things.
No one does, right?

38:47.751 --> 38:50.292
Until you've got nothing else left
to believe in.

38:52.209 --> 38:53.709
Have you told anyone?

38:56.292 --> 38:59.542
Even I don't know what I did.
I don't remember anything.

38:59.709 --> 39:02.751
It's better like this. It's a trap.

39:04.751 --> 39:08.709
That's why when I got out of prison
I shut myself away in here,

39:09.751 --> 39:12.042
to stay away
from the people I loved most.

39:12.501 --> 39:16.501
Knowing that you have this power
for all your life is a curse.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.584
The temptation to do it again
is too great

39:20.501 --> 39:22.417
and the price is too high.

39:24.292 --> 39:25.626
Did she get better?

39:27.667 --> 39:30.084
The doctors had never seen
anything like it.

39:30.709 --> 39:32.334
One in a million.

39:36.501 --> 39:38.209
Where is she now?

39:39.917 --> 39:41.417
She had a relapse.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.042
The time to pay ended and...

39:46.667 --> 39:48.334
She died because I didn't pay.

39:49.376 --> 39:50.792
I wasn't capable.

39:51.917 --> 39:53.376
Capable of what?

39:55.792 --> 39:57.251
Capable of killing.

39:59.459 --> 40:01.417
That's how the pact works.

40:01.542 --> 40:04.209
You save a life
in exchange for another.

40:04.376 --> 40:06.126
You have to take someone else's life

40:06.292 --> 40:08.417
or your worst nightmare
will come true.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.459
What are you saying?
I'd never kill anybody.

40:13.584 --> 40:16.167
That's what you believe now
but he'll tempt you.

40:16.334 --> 40:19.501
He'll put you to the test
time and again, like he did with me.

40:20.542 --> 40:21.917
Like he did with him.

40:25.167 --> 40:27.042
Fran never killed anyone.

40:28.084 --> 40:31.501
And what happened him?
He died, didn't he?

40:32.667 --> 40:33.709
His worst nightmare.

40:35.251 --> 40:38.001
What adolescent isn't terrified
by his own death?

40:38.167 --> 40:41.709
Soon you'll know how much time you have.
The spider will tell you who your victim is.

40:41.876 --> 40:44.334
- Let go of me or I'll scream!
- Listen to the spider.

40:54.292 --> 40:57.459
Another thing,
your own life doesn't count.

40:57.584 --> 41:00.834
- Suicide would be too easy.
- Leave me alone.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.417
Don't waste any more time
or your daughter will die.

41:29.126 --> 41:30.751
Come on, love, give me a hand.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.584
It'll do you good to do something.

41:56.501 --> 41:57.709
What are you doing?

42:04.417 --> 42:06.501
He told me he knew a place.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.126
<i>That no one would see us.</i>

42:13.417 --> 42:16.334
<i>He took my things
and locked me in the car.</i>

42:23.501 --> 42:27.251
Please! Please, let me out! Please!

42:27.417 --> 42:28.792
Please!

42:29.001 --> 42:31.126
He told me he didn't want to do it,

42:33.126 --> 42:34.834
but he had no choice.

42:35.042 --> 42:37.542
Please! I could die!

42:38.667 --> 42:41.501
Please! Please!

42:43.501 --> 42:45.042
Please!

42:46.709 --> 42:48.084
Please!

42:48.501 --> 42:51.667
I don't understand, dad.
I don't understand!

42:55.501 --> 42:56.709
There, there.

42:58.501 --> 43:00.084
There, there, love.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.751
How long?

43:08.876 --> 43:10.251
I said, how long?

43:12.501 --> 43:16.584
The prosecution wants for 20 years,
but considering that the victim is 15

43:16.751 --> 43:19.501
and he admitted you didn't force him,

43:19.667 --> 43:20.917
10 or 12 years.

43:22.584 --> 43:25.084
And if I claimed temporary insanity?

43:25.251 --> 43:26.792
You aren't mad.

43:27.001 --> 43:29.584
You can distinguish perfectly
between right and wrong.

43:29.751 --> 43:31.501
But insanity would be
a mitigating circumstance.

43:31.626 --> 43:33.626
I wouldn't even get two years.

43:33.792 --> 43:36.626
If you did your job
I wouldn't have to go to prison.

43:36.792 --> 43:38.251
Right?

43:38.417 --> 43:42.292
Any other lawyer would fight
to get me declared sick. Yes or no?

43:44.626 --> 43:45.834
Yes or no?

43:48.001 --> 43:48.834
Yes.

43:50.501 --> 43:51.459
Fucking bitch!

43:52.209 --> 43:54.834
I'll report you.
I'll have you recused.

43:55.042 --> 43:57.501
- Go ahead. Do me that favor.
- What are you doing?

43:57.626 --> 44:01.334
Where do you think you're going?
Don't dare open that door!

44:04.251 --> 44:05.459
Sit down!

44:13.626 --> 44:16.417
Get help! Get help, please!

44:21.876 --> 44:23.251
My pills...

45:55.626 --> 45:57.417
I'll leave the towels here.

46:03.792 --> 46:05.001
Dad,

46:07.834 --> 46:09.584
why do you carry an unloaded gun?

46:13.084 --> 46:15.084
I wish
I'd always carried it like that.

46:16.501 --> 46:20.209
But you were doing your job, right?
You saved your partner.

46:21.251 --> 46:25.251
Yes, but no one should be able
to decide about another person's life.

46:26.376 --> 46:27.917
Is that why you started drinking?

46:33.792 --> 46:35.501
Is that why you separated?

46:39.376 --> 46:41.167
I haven't had a drink in three months.

46:45.542 --> 46:46.792
Get in the bath.

46:53.001 --> 46:54.417
- I'll get my jacket.
- OK.

46:57.459 --> 47:01.209
Clara is a bit better.
She's going to have a bath.

47:04.792 --> 47:06.501
Álex, listen.

47:10.167 --> 47:11.417
Thanks.

50:10.167 --> 50:11.209
Clara?

50:11.751 --> 50:13.626
Clara!

50:13.792 --> 50:14.792
Clara!

50:16.417 --> 50:18.251
Clara, can you hear me?

50:18.917 --> 50:22.251
Clara, open the door!

50:29.709 --> 50:31.667
Clara! Clara!

50:35.376 --> 50:38.126
Look at me. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

50:38.834 --> 50:39.876
Look at me.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.834
- I'm going to die.
- No.

50:47.292 --> 50:50.334
We're all right, my love. Trust me.

51:11.292 --> 51:12.709
Sit down.

51:13.084 --> 51:15.126
<i>Hello, this is Álex.</i>

51:15.292 --> 51:17.542
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

51:17.709 --> 51:21.667
Álex, I need to see you.
I'm on my way with Clara.

51:21.834 --> 51:23.376
I have to tell you something.

51:57.917 --> 51:59.084
Are you OK?

52:00.792 --> 52:02.209
Are you OK?

52:11.084 --> 52:12.292
Don't move.

52:48.792 --> 52:51.209
- <i>Emergency, 112.</i>
- Hello?

52:53.001 --> 52:54.501
We've had an accident.

52:54.626 --> 52:58.084
- <i>OK.</i>
- Send someone quickly.

52:58.251 --> 53:01.251
- <i>Can you give me the exact address?</i>
- No, not exactly.

53:03.042 --> 53:04.917
Just a minute.

53:05.126 --> 53:07.917
Yes, it's the... C42,

53:08.126 --> 53:09.167
kilometer 94.

53:09.334 --> 53:12.209
<i>Very well, the emergency services
are on their way.</i>

53:12.376 --> 53:15.042
- <i>Has anyone been wounded?</i>
- Clara?

53:16.126 --> 53:18.001
- <i>Ma'am?</i>
- Clara?

53:21.334 --> 53:22.626
Clara... Clara!

53:26.667 --> 53:28.251
Clara, come up!

53:29.417 --> 53:31.126
It's dangerous, get out of there!

53:34.584 --> 53:36.876
Come up! Come up! Come up!

54:21.501 --> 54:22.542
Leave me alone!

54:26.751 --> 54:28.251
Leave me alone!

54:35.334 --> 54:36.876
Clara, come up!

54:51.501 --> 54:53.292
Come up! Hurry up!

56:01.376 --> 56:02.542
Love!

56:04.626 --> 56:07.751
- How are you?
- They got out unharmed.

56:10.459 --> 56:12.626
And the other car?

56:15.709 --> 56:18.417
Let's go home. Come on.

56:21.126 --> 56:22.376
I'm going to bed.

56:45.501 --> 56:46.709
Come with me.

57:08.501 --> 57:09.876
What's wrong?

57:14.376 --> 57:16.042
What happened tonight.

57:18.667 --> 57:21.834
I let the driver die.
I could have saved him but I didn't.

57:22.084 --> 57:25.084
No. No one could have done anything.

57:25.251 --> 57:27.584
Clara and you were in danger.
You saved her life.

57:27.751 --> 57:29.292
You don't understand.

57:31.376 --> 57:33.542
I went to a place the night Fran died.

57:34.084 --> 57:36.417
- He sent me an address and told me...
- I know.

57:39.792 --> 57:43.001
Today Garrido arrested that fraud.
I talked to him.

57:45.584 --> 57:48.334
I know you went to see him
and I know what he told you.

57:51.292 --> 57:53.709
If you know everything, you know

57:53.876 --> 57:55.876
what I had to do
so as not to lose Clara.

57:57.667 --> 58:01.626
That man...
I killed him, Alex, I killed him.

58:01.792 --> 58:05.709
- Mónica, it was an accident.
- No, you don't understand.

58:05.876 --> 58:08.459
Clara had no possibility
of recovering.

58:08.584 --> 58:11.501
- Yes, she did.
- Come on, one in a million.

58:11.626 --> 58:14.209
Mónica, we've been
under a lot of pressure these days.

58:15.251 --> 58:16.459
You need to rest.

58:16.584 --> 58:19.042
No, things are happening
that I can't explain.

58:19.209 --> 58:22.167
No, no, look at me.
Look at me carefully.

58:22.334 --> 58:23.542
Look at me, Mónica.

58:23.709 --> 58:27.209
You went to that place
and no one can blame you for that.

58:27.376 --> 58:29.459
You were desperate.

58:29.584 --> 58:31.042
But that man didn't help you.

58:31.209 --> 58:33.667
He took advantage of you,
and not only of you.

58:33.834 --> 58:38.126
He's taken advantage of a lot of people
over the years. And you know why?

58:38.292 --> 58:40.917
Because no one wants to accept
that all of us, some day,

58:41.126 --> 58:44.626
will lose the people we love.
No one does.

58:44.792 --> 58:46.917
But it's inevitable.

58:47.459 --> 58:50.834
And you and I will have
to accept it too some day.

59:34.917 --> 59:36.667
That's cheating.

59:44.876 --> 59:47.417
Mom! You could easily have got that.

59:54.584 --> 59:56.001
Mom, go on.

59:57.501 --> 59:58.792
Mom, go on.

01:00:15.584 --> 01:00:18.209
- Grandfather's compass.
- I've fixed the boat.

01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:20.834
You have?

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:23.584
When you come back
I'll teach you how to use it.

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:25.834
It's time you learned to sail.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.751
How about some coffee?

01:00:32.709 --> 01:00:35.417
Shouldn't you go and sleep, love?

01:00:35.626 --> 01:00:37.042
Tomorrow you're traveling.

01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:45.584
Thanks.

01:01:47.334 --> 01:01:49.251
Well, I'm going to bed.

01:01:49.417 --> 01:01:51.751
- I'll go with you.
- No, no. You needn't bother.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.084
You two enjoy the night.

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:01.251
Shouldn't we go inside?

01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:03.876
So soon?

01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:07.084
Don't you like it here?

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:14.751
What's wrong, Mónica?

01:02:15.751 --> 01:02:17.167
It doesn't matter.

01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:21.459
- Mom!
- Clara!

01:02:21.626 --> 01:02:22.709
Mom!

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:25.334
- There's someone in the house!
- What? Who?

01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:27.292
I don't know. I saw someone.

01:02:27.459 --> 01:02:29.334
- Are you sure?
- You two stay here.

01:04:13.001 --> 01:04:15.126
I can see you. Come out

01:04:17.501 --> 01:04:19.084
I'll count to five.

01:04:20.459 --> 01:04:21.209
One,

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:25.251
two,

01:04:27.376 --> 01:04:28.584
three,

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:35.501
four!
Come out, you son of a bitch!

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:39.792
Alex?

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:42.042
Dad?

01:05:13.001 --> 01:05:16.001
Call the police. And stay here.

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:23.917
Álex?

01:05:28.459 --> 01:05:29.542
Álex?

01:05:32.834 --> 01:05:34.292
Álex...

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:37.584
Álex, Álex.

01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:41.709
Oh, no!

01:05:52.126 --> 01:05:53.709
Darling, open your eyes.

01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:57.626
We've called someone to help us.

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:00.251
Hang on, OK?

01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:03.084
Hang on, we'll get out of this.
I promise you.

01:06:04.501 --> 01:06:05.709
Darling.

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:08.876
Álex...

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:12.626
Álex! No, please, please,
I'm begging you.

01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:16.834
Don't go, please.
Don't leave me alone, please.

01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:20.751
Please, please.

01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:22.834
Álex.

01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:57.792
Mom, the police are coming!
Mom, where's dad?

01:06:59.001 --> 01:07:02.501
Mom, mom! Mom, open the door!

01:07:03.542 --> 01:07:05.501
Mom, please, open the door!

01:07:05.626 --> 01:07:08.876
I don't want to be alone!
Please, open the door!

01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:48.501
Mom?

01:07:50.584 --> 01:07:52.292
Dad?

01:08:33.167 --> 01:08:34.334
Álex.

01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:37.876
Darling.

01:09:38.459 --> 01:09:39.626
How do you feel?

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:41.542
What happened to me?

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:43.876
You passed out when you hit
your head on the floor.

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:46.501
Do you remember anything
about what happened tonight?

01:09:48.376 --> 01:09:50.084
No.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:55.167
When you came down
was Alex already unconscious?

01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:56.834
Yes.

01:09:58.042 --> 01:09:59.667
Where did you find him?

01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:03.876
Where you picked him up.
I couldn't move him.

01:10:06.126 --> 01:10:08.292
- It wasn't there.
- Dad!

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.376
He hid over there.

01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:19.209
I went after him
and when he came out he charged at me.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:21.001
I fell over there.

01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:25.209
Do you remember anything else?

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:30.042
He was pushing me.
That's the last thing I remember.

01:10:32.376 --> 01:10:34.709
Are you sure
that's where you found him?

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:38.334
He must have got up
before he passed out

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:40.084
because I found him here.

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:44.209
Are you feeling better?

01:10:47.084 --> 01:10:48.084
And you, Clara?

01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:52.792
I didn't see anything.
Mom closed the door.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:58.084
I didn't want you to see him
like that, darling.

01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:02.751
Anything else you can add?

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.126
Did you see the license plate?

01:11:06.501 --> 01:11:08.167
The make of car? The color?

01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:12.251
Did you pass him
when he came out of the basement?

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:15.084
If I showed you photos,
could you recognize him?

01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:18.084
It was very dark. I'm sorry.

01:11:22.334 --> 01:11:25.251
Don't worry.
They always leave some print.

01:11:55.167 --> 01:11:56.417
Hello?

01:11:59.792 --> 01:12:01.209
<i>My brother...</i>

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:04.626
<i>You could have saved his life,</i>

01:12:05.834 --> 01:12:08.751
- <i>but you let him die.</i>
- What do you want?

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.001
- <i>I want you to lose everything.</i>
- What do you mean?

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:16.376
<i>Did you know she has your eyes?</i>

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:19.751
<i>Your daughter.</i>

01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:22.501
<i>When she's scared...</i>

01:12:23.792 --> 01:12:26.209
<i>she has the same look.</i>

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:30.167
Stop! Don't you dare
go near my daughter, you hear?

01:12:31.334 --> 01:12:32.834
Don't you dare.

01:12:45.001 --> 01:12:48.167
- If you find any prints...
- You'll be the first to know.

01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:50.751
You rest, I'll see to it.

01:12:56.584 --> 01:12:57.876
Good night, love.

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.251
How long is dad staying?

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:05.834
Until he recovers.

01:13:08.376 --> 01:13:11.751
I'm not sure about Amsterdam.
I don't feel like it now.

01:13:19.209 --> 01:13:22.501
How can you not go on that trip?
You wanted to do it so much.

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.584
My love.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.459
Don't worry about us.

01:13:31.584 --> 01:13:34.376
Dad will be fine,
I'll take care of him.

01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:43.876
You know, there's something
you have to promise me

01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:45.501
that you'll never forget.

01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:49.251
It's that everything I do
and everything I've done

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:52.292
and everything I will do,
I do it for you.

01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:55.542
You'll remember, won't you?

01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:59.001
Promise me.

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:02.501
I promise.

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:09.042
Now, go to sleep, OK?

01:14:32.792 --> 01:14:35.459
- A pain killer.
- Thank you.

01:14:35.584 --> 01:14:37.917
Do you need anything else?

01:14:38.126 --> 01:14:40.834
The bed is more than enough.
You'll get it back tomorrow.

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:46.584
You can stay as long as you need to.
Take it.

01:14:46.876 --> 01:14:49.834
You'll sleep well. Good night.

01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:52.209
Hey.

01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:55.334
Where's my shirt?

01:14:56.001 --> 01:14:57.792
The one I was wearing at dinner.

01:14:59.751 --> 01:15:01.501
It was dirty.

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:05.751
Good night.

01:16:11.042 --> 01:16:14.209
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, I'm fine, don't worry.

01:16:16.459 --> 01:16:18.334
Don't be in a hurry to get better, OK?

01:16:20.834 --> 01:16:22.001
Go on.

01:17:14.542 --> 01:17:16.251
Mom, please...

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:20.167
I'm only going for a week.

01:17:20.334 --> 01:17:22.584
That's true. Go on.

01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:24.251
- My bag.
- Your bag.

01:17:27.501 --> 01:17:28.584
Goodbye.

01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:41.334
Clara!

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.501
I love you.

01:19:34.751 --> 01:19:36.292
Laura.

01:19:36.459 --> 01:19:39.834
I've just heard about last night.
How's Álex?

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:43.751
Much better, thanks.
Listen, do me a favor.

01:19:43.917 --> 01:19:44.626
Sure.

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:47.876
I've got a case. A hit and run.

01:19:49.167 --> 01:19:51.001
Do you have the license plate?

01:19:51.167 --> 01:19:54.167
- Yes.
- We'll see who the bastard is.

01:20:00.501 --> 01:20:02.501
TRAFFIC REGISTRY

01:21:00.459 --> 01:21:03.334
Come on, come on...

01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:06.584
<i>Hi, this is Mónica.
Leave your message after the tone.</i>

01:21:06.751 --> 01:21:09.001
Mónica, it's Álex.

01:21:09.167 --> 01:21:11.417
Don't do anything stupid, you hear?

01:21:11.542 --> 01:21:14.792
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
don't do it.

01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.376
Call me.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.126
Find this, hurry.

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.376
Son of a bitch...

01:22:48.334 --> 01:22:50.417
DON'T DO IT

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:15.584
Close the door or I'll shoot you!

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:19.584
Close... the door.

01:23:19.751 --> 01:23:21.417
Close the fucking door!

01:23:22.792 --> 01:23:24.667
Close the fucking door.

01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:29.126
Who are you?

01:23:32.126 --> 01:23:33.501
Who are you?

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:44.001
Raúl Osorio.
The guy who broke into your house.

01:23:44.167 --> 01:23:45.667
The prints coincide.

01:23:45.834 --> 01:23:48.501
- He's the brother.
- What brother?

01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:51.334
Of the driver who died
in Mónica's accident.

01:23:51.501 --> 01:23:54.501
He was thrown out of the car.
He was saved from the fire.

01:23:54.626 --> 01:23:57.459
- Why has he got a file?
- For aggression.

01:23:57.584 --> 01:24:01.126
He left his neighbor tetraplegic
because his music annoyed him.

01:24:01.292 --> 01:24:03.501
He went to a psychiatric hospital.

01:24:03.667 --> 01:24:04.751
<i>I was there.</i>

01:24:09.626 --> 01:24:11.167
<i>I saw it all.</i>

01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:21.542
<i>You killed my brother.</i>

01:24:24.042 --> 01:24:26.084
- He was all I had!
- Don't accelerate!

01:24:26.251 --> 01:24:28.126
Calm down or I'll shoot.

01:24:29.459 --> 01:24:32.376
That's why you're following her,
for revenge.

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:33.417
No.

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:35.251
- What were you going to do?
- Nothing.

01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:38.834
I wasn't going to do anything.
I just wanted to scare her.

01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:40.084
What?

01:24:43.126 --> 01:24:46.001
You shot my husband, son of a bitch!

01:24:46.542 --> 01:24:47.542
- Start driving.
- No.

01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:51.584
Start driving or I'll shoot.
Drive, you son of a bitch. Drive.

01:25:03.834 --> 01:25:05.126
I've got it.

01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:10.542
Where are you going?

01:25:12.001 --> 01:25:13.417
Where are you going?

01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:29.167
It'll come on the right.

01:26:11.501 --> 01:26:12.626
Stop here.

01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.792
Give me the key.

01:26:21.792 --> 01:26:22.917
Get out.

01:26:24.459 --> 01:26:25.417
Get out!

01:26:25.542 --> 01:26:27.459
Turn round! Don't look at me!

01:26:30.459 --> 01:26:31.667
Walk.

01:26:31.876 --> 01:26:35.167
Don't kill me, please.
I've got a family.

01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:38.792
My wife, my children,
what will become of them?

01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:41.001
- You have no family.
- What?

01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:42.626
You have no family!

01:26:44.126 --> 01:26:45.751
Before, in the car,

01:26:45.917 --> 01:26:48.251
you told me
that your brother was all you had.

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:51.501
So you're lying.

01:26:51.876 --> 01:26:54.501
What were you going to do
to my daughter?

01:27:13.126 --> 01:27:14.459
What are you doing?

01:27:16.376 --> 01:27:17.917
Turn round.

01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:19.834
Turn round.

01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:21.876
Are you going to kill me?

01:27:26.251 --> 01:27:27.501
Stop.

01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:31.042
What have I done?

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:32.709
Stop.

01:27:33.626 --> 01:27:35.084
- I don't deserve this.
- Stop!

01:27:43.084 --> 01:27:44.917
You don't really want to do it.

01:27:47.001 --> 01:27:49.042
You don't have to do it.

01:27:50.626 --> 01:27:51.792
Don't do it.

01:27:53.542 --> 01:27:54.709
Please.

01:27:58.167 --> 01:27:59.542
Don't hurt me.

01:28:32.751 --> 01:28:34.292
I like your eyes.

01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:38.001
You have
the same look as your daughter.

01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:44.876
It's a pity you're never
going to see her again.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:02.584
Mónica, open your eyes. Look at me.

01:29:02.751 --> 01:29:06.501
That's it. I'm here now. Take it easy.

01:29:21.376 --> 01:29:22.584
No. No!

01:29:43.834 --> 01:29:45.001
No.

01:30:16.001 --> 01:30:18.334
Press on that... and don't move.

01:30:19.584 --> 01:30:21.042
They'll come and get you.

01:30:34.459 --> 01:30:36.501
No, no, no.

01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:38.834
Álex, no.

01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:45.501
Clara.

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:49.084
Clara, say something. Clara...

01:30:50.126 --> 01:30:52.042
Hey, Clara.

01:30:57.542 --> 01:31:00.376
She took her insulin
before she got on the bus.

01:31:01.584 --> 01:31:05.376
- How low should it be by now?
- 150.

01:31:20.584 --> 01:31:23.084
Hi. I'm still here waiting.

01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:25.501
- <i>He's in the abandoned cement works.</i>
- Who is?

01:31:25.667 --> 01:31:26.667
<i>Osorio.</i>

01:31:26.834 --> 01:31:29.709
<i>You'll find him there, handcuffed.
Send an ambulance.</i>

01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:32.084
An ambulance?
What are you talking about?

01:31:32.251 --> 01:31:34.167
<i>He was going to hurt Clara.</i>

01:31:34.334 --> 01:31:37.292
Tell me where you are.
I'm sure you can explain all this.

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:38.751
<i>Shut up and listen.</i>

01:31:38.917 --> 01:31:41.251
<i>He's got two bullet wounds,</i>

01:31:41.417 --> 01:31:43.084
<i>I shot him.</i>

01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:24.876
How are you feeling?

01:32:29.751 --> 01:32:31.876
What am I doing here?

01:32:32.917 --> 01:32:34.167
Where's that man?

01:32:35.292 --> 01:32:37.667
- An ambulance is going for him.
- What?

01:32:38.876 --> 01:32:40.917
No, you have no idea
what you've just done.

01:32:41.501 --> 01:32:43.084
I know you can't understand...

01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:46.084
but that man should be dead.

01:32:47.167 --> 01:32:49.834
You have to believe me.
Time is running out.

01:32:52.209 --> 01:32:53.917
I believe you.

01:32:55.251 --> 01:32:56.709
Clara is in the hospital.

01:32:56.876 --> 01:32:59.292
The insulin isn't having any effect.

01:32:59.584 --> 01:33:02.501
The doctors don't know what's wrong
with her but you and I do.

01:33:04.376 --> 01:33:05.292
What?

01:33:06.334 --> 01:33:07.834
I know what you did with Clara...

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:10.917
and I know what you did with me.

01:33:20.876 --> 01:33:22.209
My clock.

01:33:22.376 --> 01:33:24.042
Ten years ago

01:33:24.209 --> 01:33:27.209
when Clara was in hospital
and they told us she wouldn't recover,

01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:30.584
he appeared.

01:33:32.626 --> 01:33:35.126
We arrested him
trying to leave the country.

01:33:36.334 --> 01:33:39.751
At that time,
he was involved in various murders.

01:33:42.542 --> 01:33:46.459
He looked into my eyes and he told me
that Clara was going to die,

01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:48.792
but that I could prevent it.

01:33:50.251 --> 01:33:53.126
So... I made a pact.

01:33:54.292 --> 01:33:57.167
If I helped him he'd help me.

01:33:59.251 --> 01:34:00.876
I bribed the judge.

01:34:01.084 --> 01:34:04.167
I was just thinking about Clara...
and you.

01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:08.542
It happened exactly as he said.

01:34:12.251 --> 01:34:15.501
Despite what everyone told us,
Clara got better.

01:34:16.626 --> 01:34:19.501
When I shot that man to save Garrido,

01:34:21.834 --> 01:34:24.292
it wasn't in self-defense,
it was an execution.

01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:28.876
The price I paid for saving Clara.

01:34:30.876 --> 01:34:32.667
And I've been paying it for ten years.

01:34:39.876 --> 01:34:41.126
What are you doing?

01:34:42.417 --> 01:34:45.209
I won't let you
make the same mistake I made.

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:53.501
- Open the door.
- I'm sorry.

01:34:54.667 --> 01:34:58.376
- The keys, Álex.
- What for? What are you going to do?

01:34:59.167 --> 01:35:00.376
Save Clara.

01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:02.167
Are you going to kill
the first person you meet?

01:35:02.334 --> 01:35:05.042
- Clara doesn't deserve to die.
- Nor does the person you'll choose.

01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:06.751
Give me the fucking keys!

01:35:07.376 --> 01:35:11.501
No, I don't want to listen to you!
I don't want to listen! Give me the keys!

01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:16.042
During this time,
I saw my brother die.

01:35:16.209 --> 01:35:18.084
I could have saved him but I didn't.

01:35:19.167 --> 01:35:21.001
The price is too high and you know it.

01:35:23.876 --> 01:35:27.126
I wish someone had done
this for me 10 years ago.

01:35:27.459 --> 01:35:28.751
What are you saying?

01:35:29.792 --> 01:35:32.292
She's your daughter, Alex.
She's our daughter.

01:35:32.584 --> 01:35:35.209
Don't you see? Fear has led you here.

01:35:35.376 --> 01:35:37.876
- Saving you has brought me here.
- Exactly.

01:35:38.084 --> 01:35:40.167
And you shouldn't have done it.

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:43.084
You could have asked for help,
but no, you were scared.

01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:45.167
And if you use that gun again,

01:35:45.334 --> 01:35:48.042
you'll live with fear
the rest of your life.

01:35:48.501 --> 01:35:50.709
Darling, believe me,

01:35:50.876 --> 01:35:52.667
we have to put an end to this.

01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:55.876
Together. We should do it together.

01:36:06.917 --> 01:36:09.251
I'd rather live with fear
than live without Clara.

01:36:10.667 --> 01:36:12.084
Get out of the way.

01:36:13.417 --> 01:36:14.709
Open the door.

01:36:15.751 --> 01:36:17.209
Open the door.

01:36:18.417 --> 01:36:20.251
Open the door! Open the door!

01:36:20.751 --> 01:36:23.667
I swear I'm capable
of anything for her.

01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:28.167
So am I.

01:36:31.042 --> 01:36:32.126
Go ahead.

01:36:33.251 --> 01:36:34.376
Pay the price.

01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:50.709
Come on. Come on!

01:36:59.542 --> 01:37:00.501
Do it.

01:37:03.834 --> 01:37:05.084
Do it!

01:37:13.417 --> 01:37:16.917
Time's running out. Come on, do it!

01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:55.876
I can't!

01:37:56.417 --> 01:37:58.042
I can't.

01:37:59.876 --> 01:38:01.459
I can't.

01:38:08.292 --> 01:38:09.584
I can't.

01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:04.792
