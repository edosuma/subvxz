00:11.645 --> 00:13.779
Manson?
Anything's possible.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.081
I'm serious about being
a great cop.

00:16.083 --> 00:16.648
As serious as you are.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.319
Six months ago I was assigned
covert ops in Cambodia.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.120
We're killing children.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.222
I'm gonna give the proof
to the press.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.156
No. Let me help you.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.392
-Tell me anything.
-Just stop. Will you stop?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.794
Where you were? Where you go?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.699
Hi, Mrs. Karn. Is Emma here?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.901
You said that you would
keep her safe.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.669
Is there anything
that you don't screw up?

00:37.671 --> 00:38.971
-I will find her.
-No, you won't.

What do you want from me?

02:03.624 --> 02:07.693
I want you to have a story,
whether it's the truth, or...

02:07.695 --> 02:10.829
He say anything to you?
Manson?

02:11.398 --> 02:15.234
-He thanked me.
-That must have felt nice.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.870
He owes me now.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.505
And I can use him
to get in with Butano.

02:19.507 --> 02:23.475
Skip the pushers, get to the
supplier... My job, yeah?

02:23.477 --> 02:26.078
And I can use him
to get to Emma.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.615
For you.
You still want that, right?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.192

-Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-Shh!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.805
What do you think
you're doing?
What do you think...

03:35.182 --> 03:38.417
Oh, Katie. Lucky girl.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.953
Sure am. Right?

03:42.923 --> 03:45.657
Thank God.
We ran out last week.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.868
Where's my bandages? Huh?

03:57.771 --> 04:02.507
I'm... I'm beat all to hell
here, my head's about
to split open,

04:02.509 --> 04:05.811
and you bring me these little
things of messed up pads!

04:05.813 --> 04:09.481
It's for your bleeding.
We... We got you pills.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.849
We got you lots of pills.

04:10.851 --> 04:16.188
Doctors in the reformatory
used to bring me pills
just like these.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.658
To make me mellow.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.528
Is that what you want?
Mellow yellow Charlie?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.697
Pills will make you
feel better, Charlie.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.999
Get out!

04:33.340 --> 04:35.607
You don't want to leave,
so what's the plan?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.743
For if that pig
comes sniffing again?

04:37.745 --> 04:42.214
He was looking for Cherry.
Cherry ain't here.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.316
When we were in the city,
I told them to split.

04:44.318 --> 04:48.920
Sadie being Sadie,
they're working a Tijuana

04:48.922 --> 04:50.989

Come on.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.668
Yummy.

What do you know
about this cat, Brian?

(CLANGS)

05:31.098 --> 05:32.331
(SIGHS)

05:35.803 --> 05:38.937
We need to decide a strategy.
What to tell people.

05:38.939 --> 05:43.542
Emma can't be visiting
her grandmother again forever.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.377
Sam will find her.

05:45.379 --> 05:48.647
And bring her home.
That's our strategy.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.451
Maybe he shouldn't.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.153
What?

05:55.155 --> 05:58.757
We already found her.
What good did it do?

05:59.860 --> 06:00.592
Ken, she's 16.

06:00.594 --> 06:04.096
Drag her back home,
watch her day and night.
She'll...

06:04.098 --> 06:07.132
Find another window
to climb out of.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.802
What does Manson
want with you?

06:12.539 --> 06:12.971
He doesn't...

06:12.973 --> 06:16.074
You can't tell me this is
some random coincidence.

06:16.076 --> 06:16.641
He was your client.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.412
For a possession charge, dope.
Don't be so hysterical.

06:20.414 --> 06:20.979
I know what he is.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.649
I know what he is, Ken,
and I know the kinds of people
that you represent.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.519
How does someone like Manson
even afford you?

06:27.521 --> 06:31.390
Funny, you never asked
where the money came from
while you were spending it.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.858
Oh, don't you dare
make this about me.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.793
I knew the kind
of man you were
when I married you.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.395
-Oh, jeez, here we go.
-The half truths.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.696
-I thought...
You know what?
-Here we go.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.398
I thought that I could
live with it.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.132
'Cause I'm the
only one, right?

06:40.134 --> 06:42.901
I'm the only liar
in this house, right? Right?

06:42.903 --> 06:43.802
Stop. You know what?
Just stop it.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.871
-I knew what you were,
too, when I married you...
-Please, just stop...

06:45.873 --> 06:47.305
-What you still are.
-...and tell me
what is going on.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.808
-I told you. I told you.
-Do you want me to go
to my father with this?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.143
-I told you. I told you.
-You want him to ask you?

06:51.145 --> 06:53.712
-I told you. I told you.
-You want him looking
into your life, Ken?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.681
Because he will.
I will go to him right now.

06:56.683 --> 07:00.018
-You will not.
-I will go to him.
Tell me.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.355
Tell me.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.967
Manson knows things.

07:16.937 --> 07:21.640
About Hal, the RNC...
About me.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.541
What things?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.409
If he talks to
the wrong people,

07:24.411 --> 07:28.814
we could lose the firm,
the house, everything.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.451
That's all you need to know.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.391
Okay. Thanks.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.262
-Morning.
-You got in late.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.230
What's this?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.899
Somebody called to talk
to your guy at the bar.

07:47.901 --> 07:53.738
Who's Jimmy Butano
and why does he need to
see Charlie so bad?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.542
I got to go.
I'm sorry, babe, I got to go.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.244
Well, you... You're off today.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.047
Jimmy's not used to people
saying no to him.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.348
That's who Jimmy is.

08:03.350 --> 08:07.452
You're off today, Bri.
My mom's coming.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.056
-Your ma?
-Yes.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.891
Since when?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.827
Since she called
and invited herself.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.965
Well, she's your mom,
you can't... You can't
be alone with her?

08:21.368 --> 08:23.502
Just beautiful, aren't you?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.404
I know, I think she's got
my eyes.

08:26.406 --> 08:26.771
Mmm-hmm.

08:26.773 --> 08:31.510
But that high yellow,
that came from her daddy.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.011
(WHISPERS) Yes, it did.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.048
I ought to put her down
for a nap.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.118
Okay. Hi, sweetie.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
-Ah!

09:03.210 --> 09:06.578
Yeah, you rent to people
like my wife?

09:08.582 --> 09:11.349
I'm sorry.
If you want out
of your lease...

09:11.351 --> 09:13.184
No, of course not.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.659
Repairs will be done today.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.661
Any idea who did it?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.833
SHAFE: I got a few theories.

09:46.420 --> 09:50.722
Sorry. The door was open.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.894
Are you okay?

09:57.831 --> 10:00.865
Oh, my God. What happened?

10:02.202 --> 10:06.638
I went back to Manson's.
Emma wasn't there.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.975
But I'm not giving up.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.410
You never do.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.580
I wish that were true.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.684
-You got drunk, didn't you?
-Oh, yeah.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.353

10:21.822 --> 10:24.022
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me, too.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.825
Kind of.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.364
I can't believe sometimes...

10:34.001 --> 10:36.067
This is where we ended up.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.704
-I know.
-This is who we are.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.439
Yeah.

10:43.910 --> 10:49.781
Oh, last night, as...
As I was passing out,

10:49.783 --> 10:55.253
I, uh, I started thinking
about that dance at your club.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.989
What was it...
It was, uh, '47?

10:57.991 --> 11:01.226
(CHUCKLES) God, that summer.

11:01.228 --> 11:05.830
What was that song that was on
the radio constantly?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.565
Yeah, I don't know.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.869
Oh, <i> Time After Time.</i>

11:10.871 --> 11:13.538
<i> -Time After Time.</i>
-Mmm-hmm.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.007
God, that song was everywhere.

11:16.009 --> 11:21.112
You know, if I could wake up
any place and just

11:21.815 --> 11:23.982
stay there forever,

11:26.286 --> 11:27.919
that's where I'd go.

11:28.422 --> 11:29.688
Me, too.

11:43.804 --> 11:49.340
I, um...
I want you to look into Ken.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.643
Look into him how?
What do you mean?

11:51.645 --> 11:57.549
I need to leave him,
but I think that he might have
done something illegal.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.651
Well, he is a lawyer.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.620
No. Something big.

12:02.622 --> 12:06.691
With his partner, Hal Banyin,
and Manson.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.501
Grace, there's something
I didn't tell you.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.471
Before Manson was in prison,
he was a pimp.

12:19.473 --> 12:23.541
And one of his girls
disappeared
and shortly after that,

12:23.543 --> 12:24.409
your husband took him on
as a client

12:24.411 --> 12:30.248
and he was never charged
with the disappearance,
or for running the girls.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.118
-Wait, you knew this before?
-Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.753
-And you didn't tell me?
-Grace, just...

12:34.755 --> 12:36.554
Why would you lie to me
about who Emma is with?

12:36.556 --> 12:38.456
-How would that have
made a difference?
-Oh, my God.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.924
I don't see how that would
have helped her.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.326
You and Ken, you both just...

12:41.328 --> 12:43.128
-Me and Ken?
-Both just... You lie.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.164
-Me and Ken?
-My child is gone.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.899
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

12:47.901 --> 12:48.933
Are you... Are you kidding me?

13:17.597 --> 13:20.465
Jeanie made it
for Captain Dunne.

Just being friendly.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.734
Lou's not dead, you know.

Bringing a pie doesn't
buy you his job.

Are you okay?

13:27.741 --> 13:29.741
Yeah, I slept funny.

-You drinking again?
-What do you care, man?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.445
I care a lot.

No, this was '59.
The girl was never found.

13:59.806 --> 14:03.942
No, I don't...
I don't have a name.
She was a hooker.

No, no.
But a beating is part of it.

I do, exactly?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.691
Ask her questions,
get a statement.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.626
By myself?

14:54.628 --> 14:55.960
If it was you beaten
and lying in an alley,

14:55.962 --> 14:59.697
would you want one
of these knuckleheads
asking you the questions?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.432
Can I talk to you?

15:01.434 --> 15:05.336
Uh, you're gonna do good.
You... You'll be good.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.139
Now Kristin wants to move.
Says the neighborhood's
not safe,

15:08.141 --> 15:11.075
and I'm not gonna hear
the end of it
unless I can prove her wrong.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.877
Well, you haven't been married
long if you think

15:12.879 --> 15:13.945
proving her wrong
is gonna help.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.481
And I got to be with Butano
like two hours ago.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.649
He wants to go back
to the spiral.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.918
So you think your neighbor
Howard is the doer?

15:19.920 --> 15:23.154
Do you have any...
What do you call that again?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.256
-Evidence?
-Yeah.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.324
-I have a rock.
-Okay.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.694
I'll check it out.
But you know,
Kristin may not be wrong.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.863
You live where you live,
you got to worry about
everyone else.

15:31.865 --> 15:36.367
You live somewhere else,
you only have to worry
about yourself.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.902
Understand?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.104
-You do, all right.
-Got it.

15:40.106 --> 15:44.676
Now I'm doing you a favor.
You think maybe you can
do me one?

15:44.678 --> 15:45.410
Like?

15:45.412 --> 15:46.577
I know he doesn't want
to talk to me,

15:46.579 --> 15:50.048
but I need you
to get a message to him.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.382

15:53.353 --> 15:53.785
Saying what?

15:53.787 --> 15:57.155
Before he does anything,
I want to pay for a lawyer.

15:57.157 --> 15:57.755
What's he gonna do?

15:57.757 --> 16:01.326
Can you get a message to him?
You can, right?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.627
Yeah.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.162
Thanks.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.635

-You're a cheerleader?

16:17.978 --> 16:22.080
One of the patrol officers
recognized you.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.948
I was, USC.

16:23.950 --> 16:27.819
But my boyfriend,
he got drafted by the Rams.

at the game.

16:41.501 --> 16:45.169
I was leaving a party,
a man...

16:45.171 --> 16:50.108
A stranger pulled me
into the alley outside
the bar, choked me,

16:50.110 --> 16:53.711
and when I fought back,
did this.

16:53.713 --> 16:57.348
Were you with anyone else,
any other cheerleaders,
players?

16:57.350 --> 17:01.486
My boyfriend,
but we left separately.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.423
That bruise on your neck.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.327
I told you, he choked me.

it looks a few days old.

You never get anything
done that way.

always said.

17:38.024 --> 17:41.059
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but what's the rush?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.728
The state Charlie's in,
he's not going anywhere.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.664
I didn't get what I came for
last night.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.535
