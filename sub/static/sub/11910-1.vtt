01:38.474 --> 01:41.684
So... I'm pretty good at archery.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.439
That'll be useful
if you ever have a time machine

01:46.607 --> 01:50.693
and your time machine breaks,
and you're stuck in the Medieval Ages.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.613
You're funny. It's weird.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.449
Yeah. I'm weird.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.576
Me too.

01:58.744 --> 02:02.872
Yeah, right. Everyone loves you and
your dad's like famous, or something.

02:04.208 --> 02:08.085
My parents are getting a divorce,
that's why I had to go to camp, so...

02:12.674 --> 02:15.343
- Are you crying?
- No.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.096
Jesus.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.816
Look... I'm not really
an affectionate person.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.740
People aren't meant
to be together forever.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.618
You think so?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.411
Yeah.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.084
Can I finger you?

02:48.252 --> 02:49.418
No.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.753
OK.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.742
- Come on, baby, I got ya!
- Don't drop me!

03:33.171 --> 03:34.589
Hey! Hey!

03:34.756 --> 03:36.299
Patrice!

03:36.466 --> 03:41.178
Oh, my God! I told you
that this was a pajama party.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.681
What are you wearing?
What is this?

03:43.849 --> 03:47.310
You're wearing actual long johns?
What?!

03:47.477 --> 03:49.395
This is a frat party.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.148
You just have to be drunk
and look hot.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.233
Watch and learn.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.487
Hey. Hey!

03:58.655 --> 04:01.240
I'm so drunk!

04:06.622 --> 04:09.540
Drink! Drink! Drink!

04:13.128 --> 04:14.670
Hey, do you know that girl?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.172
The sexy pioneer?

04:21.053 --> 04:22.720
I think I know her.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.351
I'd have sex with a pioneer.
For sure.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.478
A hungry pioneer lost on the trail.

04:32.397 --> 04:35.858
- Do I know you?
- Hi, Adam Franklin of Camp Weehawken.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.319
I'm Emma Kurtzman.
You tried to finger me?

04:40.656 --> 04:44.367
Yeah. Wow!
Do you go here? Why?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.203
- What are you doing at a party of frat?
- No. I go to MIT,

04:47.371 --> 04:50.539
but I have this family thing,
and I grew up in Ann Arbor.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.834
MIT? Wow. So you grew up to be
a lot smarter than me.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.837
Yeah, sometimes
my neck gets sore.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.466
- Why?
- 'Cause my brain's so big.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.265
I agree, it didn't work. Drop it.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.686
I like you.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.605
What? Why?
You don't even know me.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.274
I like you.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.656
I have to go to this stupid thing
tomorrow. You wanna come with me?

05:25.742 --> 05:29.328
Yeah, sure. I'll come with you.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.789
- What is it?
- Some stupid thing.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.378
I wanted to leave you
with something David said to me

05:37.546 --> 05:39.422
almost every day at the lab.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.424
It's Einstein.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.010
"There are only two ways
to live your life.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.054
One, as if nothing is a miracle.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.725
The other,
as if everything is a miracle."

05:50.892 --> 05:55.438
For David, there was no bigger miracle
than his family.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.567
His daughters, Emma and Katie,
and his wife, Sandra.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.992
Mom?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.161
I want you to meet Adam.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.373
I'm so sorry.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.293
And this is my sister, Katie,
and her lover, Kevin.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.755
Boyfriend.
And my best friend.

06:21.798 --> 06:26.093
Oh, well... thank you. I didn't know
you were dating someone, Emma.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.303
Oh, I'm not.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.097
I just had a one-night stand with him
when I was 14.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.560
It was a really nice funeral.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.629
I'm sorry.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.972
I'm glad you stayed.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.476
Me too.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.564
So, I'll call you, or something...

07:20.732 --> 07:22.358
Adam, you're wonderful.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.028
If you're lucky,
you're never gonna see me again.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.141
Yes.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.564
Hey.

08:01.731 --> 08:06.110
Did we? Yes, we did.
We went to college together.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.862
You have two gay dads.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.989
Yeah, I'm the man
with the two gay dads.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.825
They helped me move
my boxes sophomore year.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.786
They're the best. I love them.
I'm super straight, though.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.122
- So, yeah.
- OK.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.415
- You're Patrice, right?
- Yes.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.333
Yeah, Eli. I'm with... Adam!

08:23.211 --> 08:24.795
I'll be right back.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.757
Pick up some of that kettle corn.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.342
- It's Patrice.
- Hey!

08:30.510 --> 08:33.554
- Patrice! Hey!
- How are you?

08:33.722 --> 08:35.097
- Weird.
- Wow.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.933
I haven't seen you in... wow.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.476
- How are you?
- Good.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.644
Adam.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.481
Emma.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.150
What is this, the Peach Pit?

08:46.318 --> 08:50.362
- And, yeah, that was a 90210 reference.
- Yeah, you're super straight.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.116
- What are you doing here?
- I just moved here a week ago.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.203
I'm doing my residency
at the Westwood Teaching Hospital.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.705
- Hi.
- Vanessa, this is Emma.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.460
- Emma, Vanessa.
- Hi. How do you do?

09:05.128 --> 09:06.545
This is our friend, Patrice.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.340
- Hi. How do you do?
- How do I what?

09:09.507 --> 09:11.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.135
Hi, you look nice.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.095
It's nice to meet you.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.933
You remember my sister, Katie.
She's just finishing school here.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.061
Yeah. I haven't seen you guys since...

09:22.229 --> 09:24.188
- Yeah, Dad's funeral.
- Dad's funeral.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.815
Sad.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.819
OK. Well, we should head out, so...

09:30.987 --> 09:32.821
Yeah, we should, too.
You know...

09:32.989 --> 09:35.407
But we should hang out.
Let me just... I'll get your number.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.160
Yeah, just give me your phone.
I'll put it in there.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.704
Yeah, that's probably easier.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.337
We really have to be
somewhere now, so...

09:48.505 --> 09:50.464
Yeah. We should...

09:50.632 --> 09:53.050
Totally. Totally.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.927
All right, well, good to hang out.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.762
- Good seeing you guys. Have fun.
- Yeah.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.890
- Take care.
- Take care, ladies.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.610
And cut!

10:53.778 --> 10:55.279
- Great.
- That's good.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.323
- OK! Yeah!
- Great. Great.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.452
OK, guys, we're gonna do this again.
All right? Five minutes.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.287
- All right, let's...
- Good job.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.332
- Great job. Great job...
- Wait. What are, people?

11:06.499 --> 11:10.753
- Hey, Benji! Good scene.
- Cool. Thanks.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.088
You looked great!

11:13.256 --> 11:16.717
Sari. I told you to play hard to get.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.136
I'm incredibly easy to get!

11:20.597 --> 11:21.930
Adam.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.433
You were gonna ask me
something before the break.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.934
- What was it?
- Yeah, I...

11:26.102 --> 11:28.395
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck, fuckety-fuck.
What was it? Stop.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.023
You wanted to know if you could
get off early to see your dad,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.192
- which is, yeah, totally fine.
- Thank you.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.278
By the way, tell your dad,
it's like my favorite show ever.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.073
Love it, own it, lost it,
bought it again. It's so great.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.699
"Great Scott!"

11:41.951 --> 11:44.828
- You probably hear that all the time.
- Not that much.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.455
Yeah.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.083
Chuck!

11:49.250 --> 11:51.627
Chuck! If I catch you taking pictures
of your dick one more time,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.545
I'm gonna take that thing away.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.851
Hello. How can I help you?

12:08.019 --> 12:11.855
- Hey, Philippe, it's Adam.
- Hi. Come in.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.168
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.837
Check it out.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.339
Vinyasa yoga
and the Army Ranger workout.

12:37.507 --> 12:41.009
- I combined them!
- Wow. That's very impressive.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.637
I'm gonna do a video, I think.
Vinyasa Power.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.806
I can almost see
where your muscles go.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.935
Very funny. Hit me.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.187
No, I'm not gonna hit you.
I don't want to hurt you.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.772
You're not gonna hurt me.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.150
Come on, hit me.
Give me your best shot.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.527
Come on, quick,
before I get a hernia!

12:58.695 --> 12:59.736
No.

13:02.824 --> 13:06.160
You're right.
Let's smoke some weed.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.162
This is really good stuff.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.831
My agent got me one of those
medical marijuana cards.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.666
It's nice to see they're
supporting your career.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.044
Yeah. So, how's the show going?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.671
I mean, great.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.591
I mean, it's about high-schoolers
who sing and dance and blog.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.303
At least you're writing,
that's what's important.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.014
No. I'm an assistant.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.602
Well, but... at least they've
seen your writing.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.229
Not yet.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.814
Actually...

13:37.650 --> 13:41.069
I wanted to get your opinion
on this episode that I wrote.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.238
Kind of a sample.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.743
That's my boy.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.704
I'll take a look at it, sure.
And then I'll call somebody.

13:50.914 --> 13:55.709
No. Do not call anyone.
Just read it and tell me what you think.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.169
OK.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.923
So...

14:01.090 --> 14:02.424
Are you having sex?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.011
Yes. I'm having sex.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.014
'Cause if you want any pointers,
you know...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.433
...I can help you out.
If there's one thing you learn

14:11.601 --> 14:14.561
after two failed marriages,
it's how to eat kitty.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.106
- Anyone special?
- No.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.359
I mean, not since Vanessa.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.278
It's been a year.
It's time to move on.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.280
It's been eight months, Dad.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.575
What did you want
to talk to me about, anyway?

14:30.286 --> 14:33.956
- You got a dog? Seriously, that's...
- Freckles! Come!

14:38.419 --> 14:40.629
You didn't tell him yet?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.297
Damn!

14:44.467 --> 14:45.926
I...

14:47.303 --> 14:50.973
Adam, I wanted to tell you.
I was just about to tell you.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.307
How long?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.726
- Well...
- How long?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.853
Not long. I...

14:58.147 --> 15:01.400
She needed a place to stay because,
you know, her landlord is such a D-bag.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.528
Christmas.
I ran into her at a party.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.155
We got to talking. About you, mostly.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.829
It looked so soft!

15:14.497 --> 15:16.915
It's not. God!

15:17.083 --> 15:20.669
Oh, that really hurt. Damn.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.506
You're fucking my ex-girlfriend?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.634
Well, yeah, but...

15:31.681 --> 15:34.933
- She's just so hot.
- I know how hot she is.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.145
- That's really sweet. Thanks, guys.
- Fuck you!

15:38.313 --> 15:41.481
Adam. All right,
I'm not the perfect dad.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.776
But the worst thing you can do in life
is to say no to love.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.822
And I think she really loves me.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.073
Don't.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.450
Adam.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.871
Hey, you know the best part
about my gay dads?

15:56.039 --> 15:56.997
What?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.166
They're never gonna eat out
my ex-girlfriends.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.959
That's true.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.713
Hey, I heard. You and your dad
are tunnel buddies, huh?

16:04.881 --> 16:08.717
- Wow, Wallace!
- She chose your dad over you, man.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.637
That's like trading an iPod
for a 8 track.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.849
You need to get even. Go have sex
with one of his ex-girlfriends.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.101
Hey, you think
when he's busting a nut,

16:18.269 --> 16:22.689
he's like, "Great Scott"? No?

16:22.857 --> 16:26.485
Wait. Can we talk about something else?
Like, literally, anything else?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.570
- Yeah.
- Of course. Yeah.

16:28.738 --> 16:32.199
- Great Scott.
- OK.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.912
- That's it. I'm going for it.
- Going for what?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.872
I'm gonna call every girl in my phone

16:39.040 --> 16:40.582
until someone agrees
to have sex with me.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.293
- That's strong. Toast to that.
- Toast.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.379
That is a terrible,
self-destructive plan,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.422
and we're behind you
a hundred percent.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.928
Well, hello to you!

16:56.391 --> 16:58.392
Yeah, I can come to Ohio.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.812
Ohio? No, you can't.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.439
I'll take a cab.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.108
No, it's fine. I'll come to you.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
What hospital?

17:09.945 --> 17:12.614
I just really need to be
with someone right now.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.866
Hey, I was wondering...

17:15.034 --> 17:17.118
Do you have someplace
I could put my boner?

17:18.871 --> 17:22.165
No, it's just... we could just snuggle
or something.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.001
What? Well, how old are you?

17:26.337 --> 17:27.671
- Oh...
- OK.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.717
I got it! I got it.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.678
I got it. I got it.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.346
I got it!

18:05.877 --> 18:08.003
You don't remember my name, do you?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.302
It's OK.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.639
It's Shira, and you look like
you could use some coffee.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.352
Yes. Coffee's good.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.527
I got...

18:33.196 --> 18:34.863
Where are my pants?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.533
I don't know. They could be anywhere.
Here's your coffee.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.368
Thank you.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.504
Did you have a good time last night?

18:51.589 --> 18:54.883
It was all right.
Nothing special.

18:59.180 --> 19:03.058
Listen, I want you to know that...

19:04.894 --> 19:06.311
...I respect you.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.355
Thank you.

19:08.523 --> 19:12.692
Normally, I would remember
the name of someone that I've...

19:12.860 --> 19:14.945
What? Oh, my God.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.406
Did you think we had sex?
Oh, my God, we did not have sex.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.576
Hey, Adam.
You left your socks in my room.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.455
- Did I?
- You did.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.251
Did I, by chance, leave
my pants in your room?

19:29.418 --> 19:32.128
No. When we met,
you weren't wearing pants.

19:32.296 --> 19:35.507
Stop teasing him, you guys.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.093
- Patrice. Hey, I know you.
- Hey.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.262
- Yeah.
- OK.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.764
What happened last night?

19:43.933 --> 19:46.184
- Did we do it?
- We had sex.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.645
Yeah. I really liked it.

19:49.981 --> 19:55.735
I didn't know that my body
could handle that much pain.

19:55.903 --> 19:58.405
And that I would like it.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.323
You're up.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.076
Emma.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.953
- You live here?
- Yep.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.455
You feeling any better?

20:09.292 --> 20:12.252
Did I have sex with anyone
in this apartment last night?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.379
No, you didn't.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.798
- No. Sorry.
- You didn't.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.343
Thank you.
Yeah, that's... that's funny.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.555
Let's make fun
of the hung-over naked guy.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.601
But I do have your pants,
so if you want them, come with me.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.979
Yes. Thank you.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.525
You don't have to feel embarrassed,
because we're all doctors,

20:35.693 --> 20:39.863
so we see literally
hundreds of penises a week.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.114
I see thousands.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.617
I just pulled a penis out
of a VitaminWater yesterday.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.827
- So, we are cool with penises here.
- OK.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.329
We're professionals.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.622
Well...

20:50.666 --> 20:52.083
It has been a pleasure.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.505
Bravo.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.634
- Nice.
- Bravo, bravo.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.304
Yep, I'm definitely gay.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.848
So, how did I get here?

21:07.016 --> 21:09.392
You texted me
that it was an emergency,

21:09.560 --> 21:12.687
and then I texted you my address,
and then you came over.

21:12.855 --> 21:16.358
And I think you thought
you were at home,

21:16.525 --> 21:18.568
because you started
taking off all your clothes.

21:18.736 --> 21:19.694
Oh, God.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.113
- Here are your pants.
- Thank you.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.957
So...

21:32.124 --> 21:36.252
- Did I just pass out on your couch?
- No.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.214
No, then you did this thing.
It was...

21:39.966 --> 21:42.384
...like a dance?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.886
- Dance?
- Yeah, like...

21:48.557 --> 21:50.558
- I shook my dick at you?
- Yeah.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.144
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.563
No, no, it was... it was exciting.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.857
It was like you were cheering
while you were doing it.

21:58.025 --> 22:01.403
You were like, "Look at my dick!"

22:03.906 --> 22:06.449
- Did you look at it?
- Yeah, I looked.

22:06.617 --> 22:10.286
It was nice.
You have a really nice penis.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.665
- Nice?
- It seems kind of like carefree.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.208
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:15.376 --> 22:19.129
Jesus. I don't know where to start.
My dad's...

22:19.922 --> 22:23.216
My dad's dating my ex-girlfriend.

22:23.384 --> 22:25.343
You told me about it last night.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.095
Did I tell you like in a charming way?

22:27.263 --> 22:29.681
Was I like charming and funny
when I told you?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.891
Yeah. You were...

22:32.059 --> 22:34.185
...naked and crying.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.481
Yeah.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.275
I'm a mess.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.114
Hey.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.826
It's gonna be OK.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.040
Thanks.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.711
Seriously.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.756
Thank you.

23:03.758 --> 23:08.136
I should probably get ready now.
I don't want to be late.

23:08.304 --> 23:12.265
Yeah, it's...
You don't want to be late.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.809
No, that would be bad.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.544
Condom?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.463
- Condom. Get a condom.
- I know. Condoms.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.507
- OK.
- Condoms.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.138
Got it.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.640
- Got it.
- Hurry.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.604
You need help?

24:00.481 --> 24:02.649
- I got it.
- OK.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.442
Here we go.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.902
Oh, you got your...

24:06.070 --> 24:07.779
- Yep.
- Let me just...

24:27.424 --> 24:29.175
- Hey.
- Yeah.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.261
- We're having sex.
- I know.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.354
Emma, we have to be
in the hospital in ten minutes.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.731
OK.

24:47.236 --> 24:51.156
You have 45 seconds to pull
your shit together, OK?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.658
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Fine.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.660
Fine.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.322
- Found it!
- Oh, great.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.781
Thank you.

25:35.367 --> 25:38.661
So, we're not gonna
tell anyone about this, OK?

25:39.663 --> 25:41.581
- Yeah. Of course.
- It's just easier that way.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.459
- Definitely.
- Good.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.506
Emma, time to go!

25:51.300 --> 25:53.384
Coming!

25:54.011 --> 25:55.470
- All right?
- Is this?

25:55.638 --> 25:58.056
- No.
- It looks like something happened.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.354
I'm gonna get the bill.
I'll pay for it.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.480
Thank you.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.899
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.323
Hi.

26:18.244 --> 26:22.330
I just wanted to follow up
that text with a phone call.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.874
Wanted to see
if you wanted to hang out again.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.334
I'm starving.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.295
That's weird. You just pulled up

26:29.463 --> 26:31.798
in front of the restaurant
that I'm eating at.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.550
Hey.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.428
Hi.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.266
- Hey. I'm Sam.
- We work together at the hospital.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.309
We have like 15 minutes
to get food, so...

26:43.477 --> 26:45.520
She's just using me for my car.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.356
- You're a doctor?
- Not yet. Fingers crossed.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.026
Awesome.
That's awesome for you.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.195
- Hey, Eli.
- Hey.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.572
Well, we're kind of in a rush,
so it was good seeing you.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.283
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.077
You look beautiful today.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.332
Nice meeting you.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.339
You piece of shit.

27:13.507 --> 27:17.593
- What?
- "What?" Let me ask you.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.305
Did you have sex with Emma?

27:21.390 --> 27:23.099
No.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.811
Did you have sex with Emma?

27:28.188 --> 27:29.230
Yes.

27:29.606 --> 27:33.735
- I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
- Yes! Wow!

27:36.155 --> 27:38.823
I called her, but she didn't
call me back. She sent me a text.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.617
- All right. Well, what'd she text you?
- "Hi."

27:42.786 --> 27:44.120
- Just "Hi"?
- "Hi."

27:44.288 --> 27:45.788
With nothing else? Just "H-i"?

27:45.956 --> 27:47.707
I don't know. What do I do with that?
I don't know.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.250
That's not good.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.294
You just gotta walk away, pal.
It's over.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.755
- She's not into it.
- Shit. Seriously?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.299
- Good seeing you guys.
- See you later.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.558
You really think
she's just using him for his car?

28:05.726 --> 28:08.978
No, Adam, I don't. I think
he wants to fuck her in his Prius.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.855
And the thing
about fucking in a Prius

28:11.023 --> 28:13.024
is that you don't have
to feel guilty afterwards.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.986
- 'Cause of the carbon footprint.
- Yeah.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.369
- Metzner talked to me the other day.
- Shut up. What did he say?

28:24.536 --> 28:28.039
He was like, "No, you're doing
that wrong." It was amazing.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.125
Emma.

28:33.796 --> 28:35.588
What are you doing here?

28:35.756 --> 28:39.967
Hi. You didn't call me back,
so I thought I'd come here.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.136
It's for you.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.766
"Congrats"? For what?
Having sex with you?

28:46.934 --> 28:52.271
Yeah. You did a good job, so...
I thought you deserved a balloon.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.941
- I'm working.
- OK.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.903
So, what's up with not calling me back?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.073
- I'm not good at this stuff.
- At what, talking?

29:02.241 --> 29:05.118
Yeah, talking. Communicating.
Relationship stuff.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.954
It's just... This is...

29:08.122 --> 29:09.539
If we were in a relationship,

29:09.706 --> 29:12.750
I'd become a weird,
scary version of myself, and...

29:13.419 --> 29:16.045
My throat starts constricting,
the walls start throbbing.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.549
It's like a peanut allergy,
like... an emotional peanut allergy.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.302
Well, I can't date you, either.
'Cause you're not my dad's type, so...

29:23.470 --> 29:25.471
Emma, rounds. Hey, Adam.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.516
- What's up?
- Look, I should probably go.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.562
Thank you.
We'll be friends, right?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.397
Yeah, friends.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.358
With the height difference?

29:37.526 --> 29:40.278
We stand next to each other,
it looks like he's kidnapping me.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.280
- What?
- You always do this.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.491
You always find something wrong
with everybody who likes you.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.743
And I date guys
who have real problems.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.204
I date guys who steal my credit card,

29:50.372 --> 29:53.040
and then they tell me it's my fault
because I left it out.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.668
You find these perfect guys,

29:55.836 --> 29:59.380
and then you're like,
"It'll never work, he's too happy."

29:59.548 --> 30:01.716
What's up, Dr. Metzner?

30:02.718 --> 30:06.220
Did I just say "What's up"
to Stephen Metzner?

30:06.388 --> 30:08.764
That was really hard to watch.

30:08.932 --> 30:13.394
Look, I know I'm supposed
to want to be in a relationship.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.231
But I'd just end up with a broken heart
and a bunch of his old T-shirts.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.859
- Just from a purely logical aspect...
- What are you doing?

30:20.027 --> 30:22.528
- I'm texting him.
- Of course you are.

30:37.711 --> 30:40.046
You know, you shouldn't have
gotten her a balloon actually.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.256
Who do you think you are,
the old guy from Up?

30:42.424 --> 30:44.217
You told me to get her a balloon.

30:44.384 --> 30:48.054
Well, I didn't think you'd actually
do it. It's a terrible idea.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.639
Listen. Hey, nobody knows about this,

30:49.806 --> 30:51.849
- so don't say anything to anyone. OK?
- All right, I won't.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.895
- It's from Emma.
- What's it say?

30:56.063 --> 30:59.607
- "Where are you?"
- What are you writing?

31:00.943 --> 31:03.778
"Hi, how are you doing?"
And then a winky face.

31:03.946 --> 31:05.947
No, Adam, it's after 10pm.

31:06.114 --> 31:08.157
Come on, the "Where are you?" text
is like saying:

31:08.325 --> 31:10.409
"Hey, I want to have sex with you,

31:10.577 --> 31:12.328
but I just need to know
how drunk you are."

31:12.496 --> 31:14.163
Hey.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.582
Did you fuck Emma
and then bring her a balloon?

31:16.750 --> 31:18.626
What? Did you tell him?

31:18.794 --> 31:20.253
No! Yes!

31:21.129 --> 31:24.382
- You can't tell anyone.
- She just texted him, "Where are you?"

31:24.550 --> 31:25.883
Oh, she wants the dick.

31:26.802 --> 31:30.096
Adam, you want to come back strong
here. Go from a position of power.

31:30.264 --> 31:33.975
Something like, "Where am I?
Why don't you check your underpants."

31:34.142 --> 31:36.018
- Yeah. Don't write that.
- Yeah!

31:36.186 --> 31:39.230
- I would never write that.
- See, I like to be kind of scary.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.191
Like, "Boo! Here comes my dick."

31:42.818 --> 31:45.319
Did you have sex with some girl
and give her a balloon?

31:46.321 --> 31:49.740
Can we not tell everyone?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.034
I apologize.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.995
So, what'd you write back?

31:54.830 --> 31:56.163
"Hi."

32:02.170 --> 32:04.422
- Yeah, that could work.
- Yeah, it's not bad. "Hi" is fine.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.851
There were so many
interesting things going on.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.729
- Yeah.
- That flippy thing, what was that?

32:20.606 --> 32:23.816
Sure, I just, I don't know,
I had an idea, I just went with it.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.611
- That was a really good call.
- Thank you.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.827
We probably shouldn't snuggle.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.706
Yeah. That just felt wrong.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.292
I should head out.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.253
- Already?
- Yeah.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.882
You want to grab a muffin
or something?

32:48.050 --> 32:50.593
I can't. I have to go to work.

32:50.761 --> 32:56.098
OK. You know,
I don't want to freak you out, but...

32:56.266 --> 32:59.018
...I'd love to hang out with you
in the daytime sometime.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.021
It's not really possible.
I have no time.

33:02.731 --> 33:06.525
I work 80 hours a week,
doing 36-hour shifts.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.197
What I need is someone who's gonna be
in my bed at 2am,

33:11.365 --> 33:14.617
who I don't have to lie
to or eat breakfast with.

33:14.785 --> 33:17.870
I hate breakfast. And lying.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.706
I also hate war.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.802
Do you want to do this?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.554
Do what?

33:36.264 --> 33:40.685
Use each other for sex,
at all hours of the day and night.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.520
Nothing else.

33:47.734 --> 33:51.529
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Good.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.784
It's gonna be fun.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.829
- You know this is never gonna work.
- Why not?

33:59.996 --> 34:02.790
Because clearly you're gonna
fall in love with me.

34:02.958 --> 34:06.127
Oh, really?
Well, then we just do this

34:06.294 --> 34:09.714
until one of us feels something more,
and then we stop.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.426
- Well, it won't be me.
- It won't be me.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.724
Good luck with that.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.228
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.023
We're sex friends.

34:28.190 --> 34:31.110
Just friends who have sex.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.487
That's not possible.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.592
I'm going to distribute these
for an hour or so.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.193
Listen, we should keep this simple.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.279
I mean, maybe we should establish
some ground rules.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.573
Ground rules. Good idea.

35:17.741 --> 35:21.035
OK, well, we can start
with no fighting.

35:21.203 --> 35:24.121
- No lying.
- Those are good ones.

35:24.289 --> 35:28.167
No jealousy, no staring deeply
into each other's eyes.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.212
Don't list me as your emergency contact.
I won't come.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.047
Isn't that against
your Hippocratic oath?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.256
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

35:34.424 --> 35:36.467
- I'd let you die.
- Oh, yeah?

35:37.260 --> 35:40.054
I'll be back in like... an hour.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.431
Have fun.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.017
I'm just getting some yogurt.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.355
God, I am single as fuck.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.450
Oh, my God.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.161
It looks like it's coming right at me.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.206
Hey, one more thing.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.083
Don't call my penis cute.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.168
Even if it's dressed up
like a Care Bear,

36:11.336 --> 36:13.546
and it's giving you a Care Stare.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.090
Don't dress up your penis. Ever.

36:27.227 --> 36:31.605
Does your insurance
cover invasive procedures?

36:31.773 --> 36:34.233
OK. OK, this is getting
a little too realistic.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.110
Trust me.

36:46.454 --> 36:50.583
I can't focus on my porn with all this
real sex going on around me!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.344
Yes, I'm ready.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.471
What are you doing?!

37:07.392 --> 37:10.269
I just friended you. Do you think
you're gonna confirm or ignore?

37:10.437 --> 37:13.063
Oh, I'm gonna confirm.
For sure.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.233
Yeah, look at you. Of course.

37:21.323 --> 37:22.948
Anytime.
Need some help?

37:23.116 --> 37:25.868
Oh, beautiful! Beautiful!

37:38.632 --> 37:40.966
...the tomatoes are Australian.

37:49.351 --> 37:50.976
- What was that?
- What?

37:51.144 --> 37:54.897
- Are you being jealous?
- Of that guy? Come on.

37:55.065 --> 37:57.858
Look, even if I did like him,
it doesn't change what we're doing.

37:58.026 --> 38:02.237
- Ah, so you like him.
- Adam, I'm not yours.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.907
No, of course not.
Why would I think that?

38:06.159 --> 38:10.245
Wow. Prius. Nice.

38:10.997 --> 38:14.375
- It's kind of girly, but nice, huh?
- What do you drive?

38:14.542 --> 38:18.587
Just an old BMW.
Five series. Right there.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.590
Oh, yeah, sure.
I actually paid for mine.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.343
I didn't take it from my parents.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.804
Yeah, I paid for mine, too.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.681
Oh, yeah?

38:30.892 --> 38:33.310
You're a big guy.
Do you work out?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.854
Oh. I row.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.398
Like boats?

38:37.565 --> 38:40.901
- I rowed crew at Harvard.
- Oh, Harvard.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.861
What were you, a cocksman?
What do they say?

38:43.029 --> 38:44.905
- What do they call it?
- Coxswain.

38:45.073 --> 38:48.867
No. You know, I get it, right?
That you're sleeping with Emma?

38:49.786 --> 38:50.995
I what?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.288
That you and Emma
have sex sometimes. I get it.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.916
She's tired, she calls you up,
you drive over,

38:56.084 --> 38:58.002
and have sex for, I'm guessing,
ten minutes.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.503
Think that's gonna last?

39:01.881 --> 39:03.799
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:03.967 --> 39:06.468
Sure you do.
And that's fine, for now.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.972
But you should just know that I'm gonna
be there right next to her every day,

39:10.140 --> 39:12.599
using big words...

39:12.767 --> 39:14.852
...saving people's lives.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.188
Then, when she's done having
her fun with you, she's gonna

39:18.356 --> 39:22.359
come running to me, because
I'm a grownup, and I have a real job.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.447
I can actually take care of her,
you know?

39:27.741 --> 39:29.992
I'm the guy she marries, Adam.

39:30.910 --> 39:35.080
You're the guy she fucked a couple
of times in the handicapped bathroom.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.977
- What's this?
- These are my feet, Adam.

39:57.145 --> 40:00.397
- They're fantastic.
- No, this.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.691
That's your script.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.651
Your dad told me to give it to you.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.488
Yeah, he read it,
and he gave you notes, and...

40:08.448 --> 40:11.492
I'm not saying Alvin and I
did mushrooms together,

40:11.659 --> 40:13.952
but I'm not prepared
to say that we didn't.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.455
I know that you have issues
with your dad, and that's cool,

40:16.623 --> 40:19.792
but he really likes you
and he definitely likes me,

40:19.959 --> 40:22.669
and we were just jamming ideas
and goofing around

40:22.837 --> 40:25.130
and tripping our balls off.

40:26.007 --> 40:29.843
Hey. So... I really feel
like it needs to be more ghetto.

40:30.011 --> 40:34.306
You know, like, more crunk?
Can you work it out? Thanks.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.849
- Hey. Nice moves.
- Hey.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.811
I know you were trying really hard
out there, but it just didn't work.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.772
Hey, would you ever? I...

40:41.940 --> 40:44.024
I wrote an episode.

40:44.192 --> 40:47.986
- I used to write in college, so...
- OK.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.822
I'm gonna have to stop
you right there.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.282
- Not your job.
- Yeah.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.078
Hey. I'm, like, actually
one of those freaks who reads things,

40:56.246 --> 40:58.664
so if you wanted to give it to me,
that's cool.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.374
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:00.542 --> 41:01.708
- Thank you.
- Sure.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.670
Megan listens to me.
Sometimes.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.383
Victoria! Seriously?
Like, I can see you smoking right there.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.969
Put it out!
I'm not gonna chase you.

41:12.846 --> 41:17.516
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna...
Victoria! Hey!

41:22.272 --> 41:23.730
Emma!

41:23.898 --> 41:25.858
Katie, is everything OK?
I got your message.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.735
Emma, I have really good news.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.904
OK, it happened yesterday
after the picnic,

41:31.072 --> 41:33.532
but I wanted to tell you in person.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.161
Oh, my God.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.580
I'm getting married.

41:39.747 --> 41:40.956
I'm getting married!

41:41.124 --> 41:43.500
- You're getting married.
- I'm getting married!

41:45.253 --> 41:47.880
Mom is so excited.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.883
She was like screaming
and crying last night.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.594
And she's gonna fly down with Bones
and help me shop for the dress.

41:53.761 --> 41:57.639
With who? "Bones"?
Who's Bones?

41:57.807 --> 42:00.392
- Oh, crap.
- Katie, who's Bones?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.103
He's Mom's friend.

42:03.271 --> 42:06.440
I wasn't supposed to tell you
about it. Crap.

42:06.608 --> 42:11.028
She has a boyfriend?
Named Bones?

42:11.196 --> 42:13.780
- What is he, a drifter?
- No.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.407
Why didn't she tell me?

42:16.701 --> 42:18.368
Well, Emma...

42:19.537 --> 42:22.122
You're so good at being alone.
Mom and I aren't like that.

42:22.290 --> 42:25.375
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It just is true.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.295
Look, Katie.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.715
You're 22. Do you really think
you're ready to quit school?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.176
I love him.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.059
Tea for your 'gina.

42:43.311 --> 42:46.230
Thanks. My sister's getting married.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.981
- Yes, we know that.
- We heard.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.150
Oh, shut up, Emma.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.693
Did you take your Pamprin?

42:51.861 --> 42:53.654
- Leave me alone.
- You leave me alone.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.697
I love it when we're all
on the same cycle.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.658
We all get to be
passive-aggressive and fight.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.785
You are not even a woman.

43:01.329 --> 43:02.913
Who is that?

43:05.792 --> 43:07.000
Hello?

43:07.168 --> 43:09.211
Hey, it's Adam.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.172
Are you kidding me?

43:13.841 --> 43:15.050
Go away.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.844
I've got cupcakes.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.194
Hello, everyone.

43:34.362 --> 43:37.781
I told you not to come.
It's not safe in here.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.033
Do you think that you have
red velvet in there?

43:40.201 --> 43:41.702
I might.

43:41.869 --> 43:45.580
Let's take a look
and see what we have here.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.667
Shira, chocolate. Now.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.754
I understand what's going on.
You're all on the same cycle.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.881
This is very exciting.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.802
Your uterine walls will be shedding
for the next three to five days.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.430
Nice memorization.
Did you Google that?

44:01.597 --> 44:03.557
I may have.

44:03.725 --> 44:07.519
Because you're women.
And I think that's a beautiful thing.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.857
It's like a crime scene in my pants.

44:12.025 --> 44:15.610
Oh. I also...

44:16.654 --> 44:18.530
...made you this.

44:18.698 --> 44:21.074
To help soothe your womb.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.161
It's a mix.

44:24.329 --> 44:28.081
"Even Flow,"
"Red Red Wine."

44:28.249 --> 44:30.083
"Sunday Bloody Sunday"?

44:31.002 --> 44:32.669
Adam.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.880
Did you make me a period mix?

44:36.132 --> 44:37.716
That's so romantic.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.926
Frank Sinatra.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.179
"I've Got The World On A String."

44:42.347 --> 44:44.264
It's a classic.

44:46.476 --> 44:49.436
Keep, keep bleedin' love

44:49.604 --> 44:51.104
I keep bleedin'...

44:51.272 --> 44:53.398
Get that shit away from me.

44:53.566 --> 44:56.276
Come on, it's soup.
It's good for your uterus.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.196
Just take it,
or I'm gonna keep singing.

45:03.576 --> 45:07.954
Keep bleedin',
I keep, keep bleedin' love

45:23.221 --> 45:24.930
Oh, shit.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.265
Oh, Adam.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.644
Adam.

45:30.812 --> 45:32.312
What?

45:33.940 --> 45:37.651
We fell asleep. We were spooning.

45:39.821 --> 45:41.655
- We were?
- Yeah.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.825
And we were spooning
with our clothes on,

45:44.992 --> 45:47.994
which is like ten times worse.

45:48.162 --> 45:49.996
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

45:50.164 --> 45:53.625
- Fully clothed spoon.
- This is bad.

45:57.422 --> 46:00.757
This is my fault.
I should not have made you soup.

46:01.634 --> 46:05.303
- What are we gonna do?
- About what?

46:05.471 --> 46:08.890
Maybe we should...
Maybe we should stop for a while.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.602
No, we're not stopping.

46:13.354 --> 46:17.149
Yeah, well, I don't know.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.902
Go hook up with someone else.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.615
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, go...

46:25.783 --> 46:28.785
Go to the nearest bar
and have sex with a stranger.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.413
- You're kidding?
- No.

46:37.044 --> 46:41.089
- This is crazy.
- You made me a period mix.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.429
Adam, this is an emergency.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.890
- So you just want me to go?
- Yeah.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.434
- Just have sex with a random woman?
- Yeah, go.

46:52.602 --> 46:54.311
Like a sexual woman?

46:54.479 --> 46:56.062
Yes!

46:58.065 --> 47:00.609
I'll go have sex with someone, too.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.326
OK.

47:11.245 --> 47:15.081
- No, this is gonna be good for us.
- Yeah. It's great.

47:20.254 --> 47:22.797
Great. Well done. Well played.

47:23.758 --> 47:25.258
Bye.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.179
I haven't seen her in two weeks, so...

47:30.890 --> 47:32.432
She said I should hook up
with other people.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.850
I mean, what am I supposed to do
with that?

47:34.018 --> 47:37.395
- Look at my face.
- No, I get it. I just...

47:37.563 --> 47:39.147
Look at my face.
What does my face say?

47:39.315 --> 47:41.608
Yeah, Adam, come on,
you're living every man's dreams.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.485
I mean, she wants you to hook up
with other girls.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.695
- Yes.
- Look, in ten years from now,

47:45.863 --> 47:47.739
you're gonna be having sex
with your wife.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.699
And it's gonna be
in the missionary position.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.160
- And one of you is going to be asleep.
- Yep.

47:52.328 --> 47:54.329
And you're gonna think
back to this moment,

47:54.497 --> 47:57.290
and you're gonna call me up, crying.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.835
And I'm gonna laugh in your face, Adam.
I'm sorry, but it's what I'm gonna do.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.504
This is a gift right now.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.464
You don't even have to have
breakfast with her.

48:04.632 --> 48:07.133
I know. I get that. I just...

48:07.301 --> 48:09.135
Look at my face.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.139
You bringing Adam
to the Christmas party tonight?

48:13.307 --> 48:16.393
No. Things were getting too intense,
so we decided not to see each other

48:16.561 --> 48:18.311
until we hook up with other people.

48:18.479 --> 48:23.149
OK. Yes. Good.
We are getting laid tonight, right?

48:23.317 --> 48:25.652
This is gonna be like Sideways,
except that you're Paul Giamatti,

48:25.820 --> 48:27.988
- and I'm the guy that gets laid.
- I can't get laid?

48:28.155 --> 48:30.782
No. Tonight is about me, Emma.
All right? I'm feeling hot.

48:30.950 --> 48:32.784
I'm feeling good.
I am wearing bikini bottoms

48:32.952 --> 48:34.411
because my other underwear is dirty.

48:34.579 --> 48:37.330
All right, we're hot. You feel hot?

48:37.498 --> 48:39.499
No one threw up on me today.

48:39.667 --> 48:43.044
We're sluts, Emma!
We're dirty, dirty, sluts!

48:43.212 --> 48:45.672
- OK.
- Remember, we're sluts!

48:58.853 --> 49:00.687
Good evening, sir.

49:02.815 --> 49:05.483
No, I got that! I got that, pal.
That's gonna be me.

49:08.696 --> 49:11.698
- Did you just open the car door for me?
- Yes, I did.

49:11.866 --> 49:14.367
No one's ever done
that for me before. Do it again.

49:14.535 --> 49:16.036
All right.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.334
- How's that?
- It's amazing.

49:23.502 --> 49:24.669
Can I have your arm?

49:26.839 --> 49:29.549
So, when I have to tell someone
that someone they loved died,

49:29.717 --> 49:32.552
it's hard, you know?
Sometimes I laugh.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.055
Because it's kind of weird.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.389
Very nice.

49:36.557 --> 49:40.268
- Oh, don't even think about it.
- I'm gonna go talk to him.

49:40.436 --> 49:42.062
Emma, no.

49:42.229 --> 49:45.106
I'm gonna do this.

49:45.274 --> 49:48.151
Emma, think about your career.
Do not do this.

49:51.113 --> 49:52.989
- Dr. Metzner.
- Yes?

49:53.157 --> 49:55.033
Hi. I'm Emma Kurtzman.

49:56.077 --> 50:01.956
I've been ho, ho, hoping
that I'd get the chance to talk to you.

50:04.752 --> 50:07.545
- Does anyone here need a drink?
- Patrón!

50:08.798 --> 50:10.340
How are you guys doing?

50:10.508 --> 50:12.884
- Joy, come join us.
- Hey, Joy.

50:13.052 --> 50:14.427
- What's up?
- I have to work.

50:14.595 --> 50:15.929
- Come on, just sit down for a second.
- Sit down.

50:16.097 --> 50:17.931
- OK.
- Come on. Here. You take that one.

50:18.099 --> 50:19.182
- We're just hanging.
- Thank you.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.017
Screw the customers.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.770
She is so good at impressions.

50:23.938 --> 50:26.356
- Do an impression, then.
- Yes, do an impression.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.816
All right, guess who this is.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.278
Dad!

50:33.280 --> 50:34.989
- Dad!
- Oh, my God, that's so cute.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.116
- I don't know.
- Come on.

50:36.283 --> 50:37.867
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

50:38.035 --> 50:41.413
- Where are you, Dad?
- It's Nemo.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.623
- Yes!
- Yeah.

50:43.791 --> 50:44.958
- Nemo.
- Amazing.

50:45.126 --> 50:48.086
I don't know why I didn't get that.
How did you know that?

50:48.254 --> 50:50.922
'Cause I've seen it a thousand times.
That's how.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.883
- Drew Barrymore.
- I don't know if I'm drunk enough.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.677
- Come on.
- You can't do Drew Barrymore.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.762
Oh, but she can.

50:57.930 --> 51:03.601
Happy holidays.
I was in The Wedding Singer.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.145
That's it. That's all I have.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.480
That was kind of an amazing
Drew Barrymore.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.482
You kind of even looked
like her when you did it.

51:09.650 --> 51:12.610
Oh, my God, Joy.
I love you so much.

51:14.321 --> 51:15.447
You do?

51:16.323 --> 51:17.657
Yeah.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.200
Lisa...

51:19.368 --> 51:21.828
...I love you.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.831
- Wait.
- I'm seriously in love with you.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.750
Wait. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

51:26.917 --> 51:30.336
- I didn't have the courage.
- Oh, my God. This is amazing.

51:30.504 --> 51:34.424
- God, you look so beautiful.
- And your eyes are so pretty.

51:34.592 --> 51:37.427
- Have you got?
- Let's do this.

51:37.595 --> 51:39.596
Wallace, could you
take a picture of this?

51:39.764 --> 51:42.307
Yeah, Wallace, I got a camera
right here, if you just wanna...

51:42.475 --> 51:45.518
No problem at all.
Just get a little closer, ladies.

51:45.686 --> 51:48.688
All right. Everybody smile.

51:48.856 --> 51:50.857
Happy ho-lidays!

51:58.282 --> 51:59.532
Hey, hey!

51:59.700 --> 52:01.701
Merry Christmas. Happy holidays.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.328
Can I get you a dri?

52:07.416 --> 52:09.501
You want to get out of here?

52:10.503 --> 52:11.753
Yes. Yeah.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.797
I'll get my stuff.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.535
Listen, don't fuck one of those girls.

52:43.702 --> 52:47.622
They're not... they're not nice.
They're not nice girls.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.000
What? Emma?

52:51.168 --> 52:52.710
Is that you?

52:53.879 --> 52:55.296
Katie!

52:55.464 --> 52:58.675
Yeah, hi. What are you doing?
Where are you?

52:58.843 --> 53:01.928
I'm just studying
for the doctor test.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.555
You're coming tomorrow, right?

53:03.722 --> 53:05.431
Hold on.

53:06.976 --> 53:08.059
Hey, Adam.

53:08.227 --> 53:09.853
I am following
your instructions diligently.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.106
- Put that away!
- Who are you talking to?

53:19.864 --> 53:22.031
Are you there?
You're not there, are you?

53:24.159 --> 53:27.704
Taxi! Taxi!

53:33.919 --> 53:35.461
Take me to Adam's house.

53:35.629 --> 53:38.423
- OK, ma'am, where's that?
- Where Adam lives.

53:38.591 --> 53:40.383
- All right...
- Just go. Go.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.343
OK, I'm going.

53:57.526 --> 54:01.279
Got a cocktail for the ladies.

54:01.447 --> 54:03.948
That's my Christopher Walken.

54:04.658 --> 54:09.037
Yeah. I'll just set these
over here and...

54:10.414 --> 54:13.541
...then we can all sort
of involve ourselves in...

54:13.709 --> 54:15.752
OK, let's...

54:15.920 --> 54:19.047
Well, you guys are doing
a really good job.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.174
I'll just be over here if you need me.

54:21.342 --> 54:22.717
Adam!

54:23.510 --> 54:26.304
Adam Franklin!

54:28.182 --> 54:30.683
Adam! Franklin!

54:31.226 --> 54:32.977
OK.

54:33.145 --> 54:35.772
Just keep up the good work, ladies.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.823
What are? What are you?

54:47.242 --> 54:48.534
Hey.

54:48.702 --> 54:50.787
Are you?

54:50.955 --> 54:53.665
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

54:57.127 --> 54:59.629
What's going on?

54:59.797 --> 55:02.340
- This is Joy.
- I'm Joy. Hi.

55:03.592 --> 55:06.761
- Good for you.
- Adam?

55:08.389 --> 55:10.181
And this is Lisa.

55:11.767 --> 55:15.561
You are such an overachiever.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.021
Thank you.

55:17.189 --> 55:18.898
No, we don't need her.
Make her leave.

55:19.066 --> 55:21.734
No. You leave.

55:22.695 --> 55:24.988
Are you trying to get rid of us?

55:25.155 --> 55:26.781
You look like a pumpkin, bitch!

55:26.949 --> 55:29.742
- This is amazing.
- Oh, you make... Hey!

55:31.245 --> 55:33.329
OK. I got this.

55:33.497 --> 55:37.375
I got this. You just... calm down.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.589
But we don't look
anything like pumpkins.

55:43.757 --> 55:47.176
I know. She probably forgot
to take her meds.

55:47.344 --> 55:50.596
You know, for your own safety,
you'd better get your stuff and go.

55:50.764 --> 55:52.056
Thanks.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.601
Watch out, though.
She could be anywhere.

55:55.769 --> 55:58.688
She's quick. Like a puma.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.567
You're so mean!

56:02.735 --> 56:07.447
Ring, ring! It's the pumpkin patch!
They want their pumpkins back!

56:07.614 --> 56:09.866
- We're not pumpkins!
- We're ladies!

56:10.034 --> 56:12.452
But you're so orange.

56:12.619 --> 56:15.079
Hey, someone call Charlie Brown!

56:15.247 --> 56:17.707
We found the Great Pumpkin!

56:17.875 --> 56:19.876
Ow! Don't! Don't!

56:27.134 --> 56:29.594
You're crazy.

56:29.762 --> 56:32.263
I felt like Flavor Flav.

56:32.431 --> 56:37.310
- I can't believe you chose those girls.
- Are you jealous?

56:37.478 --> 56:41.272
Don't do that.
Don't just disappear like that on me.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.150
- You told me to.
- You shouldn't listen to me.

56:44.318 --> 56:46.027
Fine, I won't.

56:54.161 --> 56:57.580
- Did you smell my hair?
- No.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.009
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Wait. Just hang out here.

57:10.177 --> 57:11.636
Right here?

57:11.804 --> 57:13.179
Oh, man.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.014
Surprise!

57:15.182 --> 57:17.934
Happy birthday!

57:28.362 --> 57:31.864
As the days of the year roll by

57:33.158 --> 57:38.037
There's one that brings a tear
to a daddy's eye

57:38.789 --> 57:41.499
'Cause I'm so happy

57:41.667 --> 57:44.836
To be your pappy

57:45.003 --> 57:49.132
Today and I'll tell you why

57:51.677 --> 57:54.345
It's your birthday

57:54.513 --> 57:56.973
Baby boy

57:57.683 --> 58:00.393
- It's your birthday
- Birthday

58:00.561 --> 58:02.895
Birthday boy

58:03.063 --> 58:05.731
- Happy birthday, happy birthday
- Hap... py!

58:05.899 --> 58:07.900
- Happy birthday, happy birthday
- Birth... day!

58:08.068 --> 58:10.444
Happy birthday

58:10.612 --> 58:11.737
To you

58:11.905 --> 58:13.322
Everybody!

58:13.490 --> 58:17.410
Happy birthday

58:17.578 --> 58:21.247
To you!

58:29.047 --> 58:31.799
Blow it out! Blow it out!
Oh, Adam, happy birthday.

58:31.967 --> 58:34.093
- We're so proud of you.
- Make a wish.

58:42.269 --> 58:44.687
Guys, you get a five-minute warning.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.439
- OK?
- No, he's ten-one.

58:46.607 --> 58:48.566
I already texted him.

58:48.734 --> 58:53.654
- So, all is forgiven?
- No. Nothing is forgiven.

58:54.448 --> 58:57.116
Adam, don't you think
it's been weird for me, too?

58:57.284 --> 59:00.745
Knowing that... my own son
had sex with my girlfriend?

59:02.289 --> 59:04.582
But I got over it.
You should, too.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.292
Excuse me!
Can I have your autograph, please?

59:06.460 --> 59:07.960
- Mine, too, please.
- Certainly.

59:08.128 --> 59:10.922
Listen, let me take you
to a nice birthday dinner tonight.

59:11.089 --> 59:14.634
You, me and Vanessa. We have
something we want to talk to you about.

59:14.801 --> 59:15.927
- Something?
- Yeah.

59:16.094 --> 59:19.472
- Like what?
- Just something important, OK?

59:19.640 --> 59:21.515
- Please don't do this.
- 8:30, STK.

59:21.683 --> 59:25.019
All right? Be there.
Bring anyone you want, all right?

59:25.187 --> 59:27.563
- Bye, everyone. Thank you.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.190
It's been an honor.

59:29.358 --> 59:33.152
- Great Scott!
- Bravo! Bravo!

59:37.157 --> 59:39.575
What the fuck?

59:39.743 --> 59:42.453
- What happened?
- Oh, my.

59:42.621 --> 59:45.414
Are you OK?
Are you OK? What happened?

59:45.582 --> 59:47.708
- Give me that!
- That's my phone!

59:47.876 --> 59:50.753
Fuck you, Chuck!
You're very talented, but fuck you!

59:50.921 --> 59:52.255
Can we get a medic, please?

59:52.422 --> 59:55.841
Try to use it as little as possible.

59:56.009 --> 59:59.095
- No sports or working out for a while.
- Dr. Metzner?

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:04.183
Adam, what's going on?
What happened?

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:07.687
He sprained his wrist
punching a wall.

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:10.898
You texted me that you were dying.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.608
It really hurt.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:16.529
I gave him some hydrocodone for the
night. It's a very strong painkiller.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:19.156
You might want to have
Dr. Kurtzman here drive you home.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:24.620
And here is a prescription
for an anti-inflammatory.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.665
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.792
Your girlfriend here is
a very talented doctor.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.503
No. No, I'm... I'm not his girlfriend.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.463
She is not my girlfriend.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.175
Oh, sorry. I saw that he listed you
as an emergency contact.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.805
My mistake. Feel better.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.184
Oh, by the way,
I enjoyed your dad's TV show.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:49.645
Great Scott. That's funny stuff.

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.356
I'll tell him you said that.

01:00:57.446 --> 01:01:00.573
My dad invited me to dinner,

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:02.742
and he's bringing Vanessa.

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:06.454
- You have to come.
- No, I don't.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.873
I just worked 14 hours.
I'm not gonna meet your parents.

01:01:09.041 --> 01:01:11.917
You know what? Just help me.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.923
These are really powerful painkillers.
I can't feel anything.

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.552
Feel that?

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:26.015
Yeah. I felt that.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.100
Happy birthday, Adam.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.603
I'm so glad you guys
could join us for dinner.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:33.439
Cheers. I'll come right back
to take your order.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:38.235
So, how you doing there, kiddo?

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:41.864
Perfect, Dad.
Thank you for asking.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:44.784
How long have you two been together?

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.702
Oh, we're not.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.164
- We're sex friends.
- Yeah. Yes, we are.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:54.460
Yeah, friends with benefits?
Fuck buddies?

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.089
Great Scott!

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:03.636
I know this might be hard,
but just because I'm your ex-girlfriend

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:09.392
doesn't mean that you can't
look at me as a kind of... mum?

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.477
- Oh, boy.
- Especially because, well,

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:17.566
Alvin and I have been talking about
creating new life together.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.819
You see, we were at Burning Man.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.905
- And we were dressed up.
- Yeah. I was dressed as a fire bird.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.824
And what were you dressed as?

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:28.494
I was naked. And we were just
out there in the desert,

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.330
and he was burying
my bare body in the sand.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.834
Yeah. Pecking at it with my...
fire beak.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.919
And then I just thought,

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:41.257
you know, what if all
these grains of sand,

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.051
were actually babies?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:48.264
- And so we...
- We had this wonderful idea.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:52.560
And we... well,
we'd like your blessing, Adam.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.272
How do you feel about the two of us
having a baby together?

01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.733
Adam.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:05.281
This isn't really my place.
I mean, who am I?

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.283
I just have sex
with your son sometimes.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.118
- But...
- Yes, she does.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.746
But... there is really no reason

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:15.207
for you to bring a child
into this world,

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.918
since you're acting
like children already.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:20.337
- That was really mean.
- Yeah.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.549
I'm mean. But you're fucking crazy.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.843
'Cause given the choice
between Adam and his dad,

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:27.887
given the choice between Adam
and anyone, really,

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.598
I'd choose Adam, every time.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:36.187
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Yep.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.355
Fuck this.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.692
Oh, by the way...

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.652
...it's the best sex of my life.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.492
Great Scott!

01:03:56.625 --> 01:04:00.794
I have to say, this is probably
the best birthday dinner ever.

01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:02.880
I wanted to make it special.

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.381
Yeah? Where's the cake?

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:07.384
That comes later, baby.

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:12.264
- Hey.
- What?

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:15.935
Thank you for what you did
back at the restaurant.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:36.121
Go on a date with me.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.041
You're heavily sedated.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.670
Come on, it's... it's one date.
Just do it.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.756
Why? So I can wear makeup
and act perfect all night?

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:47.383
Yeah.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:51.470
I'll pick you up, and we can talk
about our favorite books

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.348
and our favorite TV shows.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:57.017
I'll pay for everything,
and you can reward me

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:59.979
with an over-the-jeans cock rub.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.356
Like a real date.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:05.943
- Is that really what you want?
- This Friday.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.362
This Friday is Valentine's Day.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.863
- Yeah.
- No.

01:05:10.031 --> 01:05:12.324
Go big or go home.
There'll be hearts,

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:15.077
and maybe some flowers.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:19.665
One date.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:25.296
Fine.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:31.343
- What?
- I'll go on a date with you.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.138
- I thought that's what you said.
- But no flowers, OK?

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.076
You look amazing.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.662
Thank you.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.960
- You said no flowers.
- That's pretty cute.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.962
Yeah, I'm pretty good at this.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.466
Thank you.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:14.970
I've had a really tough day,
so, I just won't...

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.765
I promise. It's about to get better.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:34.573
- I made you a Valentine's Day card.
- What?

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.078
It's perfect.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:42.706
Can you read it for me?
Is that weird?

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:48.545
"You give me premature
ventricular contractions."

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.925
- I'm assuming that's a good thing?
- You make my heart skip a beat.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.846
- Don't make fun of me.
- Wow.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.849
- So, you ready for tonight?
- Yeah.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.227
I'm glad to see you.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.774
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.026
- Louder!
- Yeah!

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.529
- Yeah!
- So excited!

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:19.118
- Here's our itinerary.
- You made me an itinerary?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:22.121
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We got to make up for lost time.

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:25.040
Google Maps. Nice.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:28.627
OK, full disclosure:

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.963
I have played before,

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:33.382
and I might be kind of good.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.050
- This is pretty.
- It is pretty.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.720
- But this... it's just gonna be fun.
- OK.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:39.471
Ladies first.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:43.976
OK. Don't expect too much.

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:49.481
Nice and easy.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.410
- Yeah. I stuck it in.
- Wow.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.829
Well, this hole's
a little bit more complicated.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:07.624
You're gonna have to bank it off there.
It's all about the geometry.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:09.168
I'm a doctor.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.558
That hole is my bitch!

01:08:38.823 --> 01:08:41.533
Yes! Yes!

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.285
Yeah!

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:46.162
Thank you.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.791
I don't get my own milkshake?

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.877
No, it's one milkshake, two straws.
That's what makes it special.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.837
But I'm so hungry.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:57.716
We have dinner later.
Didn't you read the itinerary?

01:08:57.884 --> 01:09:00.551
You're gonna get more shake,
you have a bigger mouth.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.514
You have a pretty big mouth.
Oh, easy.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.938
Hey! That's cheating.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:19.696
Sorry.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.366
Thanks.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.745
I really like you.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.122
I actually think that...

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:34.545
...I'm falling...

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.551
You can have the rest.

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:11.623
How do they change these lightbulbs?

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:13.375
Must be a nightmare.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:17.379
- Adam?
- Oh, here. You want your coat?

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.214
- I can take that.
- You cold?

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:26.471
I can't do this. Could you please
take me back to work?

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:29.182
No. No, that's not the deal.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.977
The deal is
that we're gonna walk around,

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.521
and we're gonna look
at the twinkly lights, and then...

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.690
Why are you messing
everything up?

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.818
That's what people do, Emma.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.987
They buy each other flowers,
and they go to museums...

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.282
You know me.
This stuff freaks me out.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.909
It's fake.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.830
What's wrong with what we're doing?
It's working. We don't have to fight...

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:54.333
- Maybe I want to fight.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.544
What are you gonna do?
You're never gonna feel anything?

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:59.129
How you gonna do that?

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.840
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.930
- You're so messed up.
- Yeah?

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:12.643
I don't need you to take care of me.
I take care of myself.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:15.520
That's what I do.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.567
Why don't you go find some other girl
who's not gonna hurt you?

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:25.072
Because I love you.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.532
It's obvious.
I completely love you. There.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.534
Oh, yeah. You're such a wimp.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.578
- I am not a wimp.
- Well, then be with me!

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.831
OK, you're gonna fight me.
Yeah? Is that what you're gonna?

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:39.461
You can't fight me, you're miniature.
You're like a girl Rick Moranis.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.547
You fight like a hamster.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.050
Hey. Hey!

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:49.554
Excuse me! Excuse me!
You can't do that here.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:52.516
OK. I'm sorry.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.817
All right, you're out!

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.419
I can't keep doing this.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.592
I'm not gonna see you again.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.429
I know.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.181
That makes sense.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:42.399
Bye.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:16.850
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:21.063
- You wanna go get a coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.497
You're a really good cook.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:40.248
Oh, this? I just threw it together.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:42.918
Oh, shit.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:44.836
Oh, hey, Adam!

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.216
Adam. Hello!

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.968
Lucy.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:53.720
Yeah, we were just having
a romantic night

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.889
when your friend
stopped by from work.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:57.808
Usually I spend Valentine's Day
catching up on work and stuff,

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:00.393
but this is like, this is really fun.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.854
How was your night?

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:05.273
Yeah, it wasn't.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.738
Do you want to go to my room?

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:14.032
Yes, I do. Perfect.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.409
Sorry, gotta go. So sorry.

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:19.371
Oh, you know what? I need a napkin.
Can I just borrow this one?

01:14:19.539 --> 01:14:23.500
Sorry. Just... quick.
Thank you. Beautiful.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:25.585
So, I'm really excited to talk to you.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:29.548
I hope it's OK
that I got your address from the W-4.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.925
- Is that weird? OK.
- No.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.639
Oh, wow. This is cool.
This is a cool space.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.015
- Thanks.
- Cozy.

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:41.685
I didn't know that...
I'm sorry about everything.

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:44.020
What? Oh, my God.
You're sorry? Are you crazy?

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:47.566
No, I'm sorry. I'm the one
who's come to your house uninvited.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.527
So unprofessional.
But I read your script.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:54.239
- And I love it. I really do.
- Really?

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.241
Yeah, and honestly, like, I didn't think
that you could write,

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.910
mainly 'cause you're just...
so beautiful.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:03.790
- Seriously, it's distracting for me.
- Thank you. For reading it.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.083
Yeah.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.752
I mean, it's just teenagers
singing about homework.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.921
Yeah, yeah, but no, I read it
and I was like,

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:12.799
"God, I want to, like, drive over there
and tell him in person."

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:14.676
So I did. I got in my car,
and here I am.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.429
You know, it's just...
I know, it sounds crazy,

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.264
'cause now that I'm saying it out loud,
it does sound crazy.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:22.267
It's not crazy.
I mean, thank you for reading it.

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:24.311
No, no, no.
I e-mailed it to Megan, and...

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:25.729
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:28.815
- And we'll see what she says.
- Wow.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.442
Yeah, I told her she'd be crazy
to not like it.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.778
But then again, she is a functioning
psychotic, so it's like, who knows?

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.364
But there is this extra episode
right before the break.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.908
And they are gonna hire
a freelancer, so...

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:40.410
I feel like I'm talking
too much about this, but...

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:42.454
- Hey, do you wanna?
- What?

01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.080
Yeah, sorry. What were you gonna?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.917
Just to hang out.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:50.503
Oh. That's crazy.
I was like, "What's he gonna say?"

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:53.298
And then you said that. It's not
what I thought you were gonna say.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.387
That is a chair.

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.475
Fuck, yeah.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:06.061
Do I curse too much?

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.480
Fuck, no.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:27.874
Dr. Anseed, three-two-five-one.
Dr. Anseed...

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.793
- Hey.
...three-two-five-one.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.506
Can I say something?

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:36.424
And don't take this the wrong way,

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.718
because you know I'll be
your friend, no matter what.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:41.846
It's just, you've been kind of
depressing to be around lately,

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:46.309
and I might start avoiding you
in the hallway, that's all.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.311
Just thought you should know.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.567
So, we won't be there
for the rehearsal dinner,

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.153
but we'll definitely be there
for the wedding on Saturday.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.446
Well, what are you doing tonight?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:02.659
Adam's episode is taping tonight,
so Eli wanted to go.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.912
- I don't have to go.
- No. No, go. Have fun, really.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.497
Doctors.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.459
So?

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.420
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you Saturday.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.894
- He's an amazing lover.
- Oh, boy.

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.230
That's...

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.316
...why they call him Bones.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.739
You know, I worry about you sometimes.

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.950
Why? Is this about me
not having a date?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:48.955
No, no. I know you can dance alone,
and I know that you'll be fine.

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.333
You're always fine.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.919
- So?
- I don't know.

01:17:57.048 --> 01:18:00.216
When we lost your father,
I couldn't stand to see you in pain,

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:04.596
and... I think you knew that.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:10.226
And I think that... you got good
at being strong for me.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.607
But I'm telling you, be hurt.

01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:17.734
I can take it.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.781
The world can take it.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:28.953
OK.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:33.875
Very pretty here.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.911
So come by the bar. Great place.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.997
Bring your friends.
I will take care of you.

01:19:54.165 --> 01:19:56.583
Here's my business card.
I'm the owner. Me.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.543
- So make sure you come by.
- Yeah.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:01.212
All right? Hey. Great job.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.089
- Yeah, great job, man.
- Really good, yeah.

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:06.050
- You guys liked it? Like really?
- Yeah.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.928
- But Wallace cried.
- So?

01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:11.139
It reminded me of my senior prom.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.225
I got a hand job on the dance floor
to "Who Let The Dogs Out."

01:20:15.603 --> 01:20:18.813
Hey. Sorry.
OK, so there's good news, bad news.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.316
The bad news is,
Megan is remarkably drunk.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.401
Seriously, she was, like,
trying to take her shirt off.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:26.029
But the good news is,
she wants to put you on staff.

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:28.239
- Really?
- So... Yeah.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.158
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, so she... Yeah.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.285
- Thank you.
- So, you're a paid writer.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:34.287
Yeah.

01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:37.332
Oh, my God. She's getting on
the buffet table? That makes...

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:38.958
Wow.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:40.752
Why are you not trying
to fuck that girl?

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:41.961
Yeah.

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:45.548
Yeah, she's crazy hot, Adam.
She's like a sexy scientist.

01:20:45.716 --> 01:20:48.635
You need to go over there,
man up, you need to go for it.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:51.054
We're counting on you here, man.
Man up, man!

01:20:51.222 --> 01:20:54.432
- Go for it! Man up!
- You keep saying "Man up."

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.976
- You cried during the show.
- I liked the show.

01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.314
Yeah.

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:03.608
- It was very good.
- It was OK.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.902
You know, I have to...
One minute.

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:11.824
Katie?

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:14.452
The bridesmaids had pot.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.788
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:19.958
Are you OK?

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:24.295
I'm fine, I just...
You know, I just...

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:26.631
Oh, God, I just love Kevin.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:29.509
I just love Kevin so much, you know?

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:33.471
- I know you think it's stupid.
- No. No, I don't.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:35.765
- You don't?
- No.

01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.397
I can't stop thinking about him.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:45.858
Who? Adam?

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:52.657
Yeah. I know it's over,
and I'm looking.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.202
It's just no one is as...

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.454
- Tall?
- He's so tall.

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:01.207
- So tall...
- And he's so, like...

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.961
- Happy?
- Annoyingly happy, all the time.

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:09.507
But he has this...

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:13.052
He has the best heart.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:19.559
- Call him.
- What? No.

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:21.019
I can't just call him.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.146
I'm too stoned.
Don't argue with me.

01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:24.689
He doesn't want me to call him.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:26.608
I'm the bride.
You have to do what I say.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.110
- We haven't talked in months.
- I'm the bride, it's my day.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:30.695
It's my day!

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:33.489
Hey, Adam!

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.408
Oh, God.

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:38.453
You're so dope.
Did you know that about yourself?

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.288
Mama needs to get a cab home, so...

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.540
- Yeah.
- Shoot, I left my phone in my office...

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.167
I got it, I got it. Hang on. Here.

01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:45.793
- Do you want to call and just?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.795
What are you doing?

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:51.466
Chuck! Chuck!
Will you please fuck off? Please?

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.134
- I don't want to go.
- Yeah, all right.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:55.053
I don't want to go home.

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:57.639
- I don't want to go home.
- Who is it?

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:02.226
"Do Not Call Her" is calling.
Do you want to take it?

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:04.937
I want your face.

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:18.242
Hello?

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.620
Hi.

01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:23.748
It's Emma. Kurtzman.

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.917
From Camp Weehawken.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:33.257
Yes... What is it?

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:38.846
So, my sister is getting married
in Santa Barbara tomorrow, and...

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.434
I don't know. I heard your show is
tonight. Congratulations.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.603
Thank you.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.275
I know this is random. I just...

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:55.613
I miss you. I miss you so much.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.990
OK.

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:01.828
I don't know what to say.

01:24:02.496 --> 01:24:05.623
You're... You're calling me because
you're at your sister's wedding,

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.458
and she looks happy, and...

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:11.462
...everyone is happy,
and you're not.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.510
I thought...
I don't know what I thought. I just...

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.972
I... I guess I wanted to hear
your voice.

01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:24.892
- I mean, I know we broke up, but...
- Emma.

01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:30.148
We didn't break up.
We never started.

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:34.861
I gotta go. I'm still at work, so...

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:40.533
Have fun at the wedding,
and tell your sister congratulations.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:42.869
Bye.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.130
Oh, fuck.

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:03.181
I have to...

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.808
- Go.
- Now.

01:25:10.981 --> 01:25:14.233
- Hey. Can I?
- Hey. Of course.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.861
Is everything OK? Are you?

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.571
Yeah.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:21.532
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yeah. Good.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.243
- This is amazing.
- Yeah.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:26.078
Thank you for this. This...

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:28.581
- What?
- This was all you.

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:32.043
- What? No, I mean...
- No, I'm not here without you.

01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:35.838
That's... That's not true.
It's all you.

01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:37.465
It's all you. This was all you.

01:25:39.802 --> 01:25:42.678
Hey, wait! If you don't make it back
for my wedding, I'll kill you.

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:44.514
Bye. Drive safe.

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.281
No, but that was you,
and it felt poignant

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:44.782
that, of course,
the song was "It Was You."

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:47.743
- When Benji and Sari did the kiss...
- They committed to it.

01:26:47.911 --> 01:26:50.580
That's what hit. Do you think
they could remix the song?

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:53.916
How drunk was Megan?
She tried to hump my leg.

01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:55.793
You have no idea,
the stories that I could tell you.

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:59.297
- No, she really tried to like mount it.
- Yeah, I know.

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:03.926
Yeah, I got it.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.139
Ornery thing.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:28.993
Hey. How'd it go?
Did you find him?

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:34.040
Yeah. He was with... with a girl.
It was his girlfriend.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:37.376
And I was in a bush.

01:27:37.544 --> 01:27:39.003
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:40.671
Crap.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:45.468
- Are you still there?
- Yeah.

01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:47.511
OK, get in your car and drive away.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.639
And how much money
do you have on you?

01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:54.477
Like ten bucks.

01:27:54.645 --> 01:27:57.563
OK. The box of 50
doughnut holes is $5.79.

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:01.067
You're gonna need two boxes.

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.693
I lost him.

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:06.364
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:09.992
- I love you.
- I know.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:15.206
So, then when I was, like, 11,
I was in therapy

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:18.376
because I was, like, obsessively
biting my hair,

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:21.212
and then three months in,
my therapist died.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.964
- I know, so that was kind of a bummer.
- Whoa.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:26.050
But, yeah.
That's why I hate planes.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:28.594
Thanks.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.596
- So, that's that story.
- Cheers.

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.264
Thank you.

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:40.272
- I'm so sorry.
- No...

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.400
- That was such a fail on my part.
- It's OK...

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:43.901
- Wait, let me...
- It's fine.

01:28:44.695 --> 01:28:46.070
We can... I can do better than that.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:48.280
- Can we try again?
- Sure. Mulligan.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.157
- Let's... Why don't we?
- OK.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:51.701
All right.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.210
Oh, my God. This is happening.
Is this really happening?

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.338
Oh, my God. You're touching me.
This is so happening.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.757
Maybe we don't need to talk
about everything.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:10.594
Oh. OK, great. OK. Cool.

01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:14.974
Wait. Are you sure
that you want to do this, though?

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.436
Yes. Yeah.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.563
OK, 'cause, like, we can just
talk about it, if you want...

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:24.108
- Let's not talk about it.
- Oh, OK. OK.

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.527
Wait. Should I take my shirt off,
or do you want to...

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:28.404
Do you want to take it off yourself?

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:31.532
- I'll take it off.
- You know what? I'll take it off.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.075
OK.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.706
Glad I wore a good bra.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:43.210
Is that your phone? Do you wanna?

01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:45.212
We'll just ignore it.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.423
You can just get it.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:50.134
No, it's fine.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.473
- Is it "Do Not Call Her"?
- No.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:57.475
I don't know.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.353
Wait. I'll just...

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:02.813
- OK.
- I'll just shut it off.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:06.067
Yeah, just...
That'll be easier, switch...

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:12.156
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:13.908
Vanessa?

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:21.665
- I'm coming.
- You're what?

01:30:25.128 --> 01:30:28.047
It's my dad. There's an emergency.
He's in the hospital.

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:31.175
Oh, my God.
OK. Do you want me to go with you?

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:34.887
- No, I'm OK.
- OK.

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:37.181
- Can I call you later?
- Yeah. No, I'll get a cab.

01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:39.934
I'll, like, find my way home.
Go. Yeah.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:57.201
Keep, keep bleedin' love

01:30:57.369 --> 01:31:01.622
Keep bleedin'
I keep, keep bleedin'

01:31:16.221 --> 01:31:18.430
Hey. Where is he?
What happened?

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:20.057
OK.

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.226
Don't freak out, OK?

01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:25.396
Your dad overdosed on cough syrup.

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:28.816
- He what?
- The Purple Drank.

01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:31.402
"The Purple Drank"?

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:35.406
It's Seven-Up, cough syrup
and a Jolly Rancher.

01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.201
Why would he do that, Vanessa?

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:41.453
Because he loves Lil Wayne, OK?

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.581
You don't know everything
about your dad.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:47.293
Why are you making him
listen to Lil Wayne?

01:31:47.878 --> 01:31:51.547
- You should be taking care of him.
- I can't do this. I can't do it.

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:54.466
You know, I didn't think
that it was gonna be so...

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:59.263
I don't want to have kids.
I... I just... I want to have fun.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:06.478
- He's so old.
- Yeah. He's getting older.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.440
And you're gonna have to deal with that.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:14.695
Adam...
old people scare me.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.408
Let's just go see him, OK?

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:22.536
No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
Adam, I can't. I've gotta go.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:26.540
My friend, she's having a party.
I'm already so late.

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:30.002
Will you just take Freckles?

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:39.511
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you're a terrible person.

01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.805
Just take Freckles.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:13.837
Hey, Dad.

01:33:16.758 --> 01:33:18.300
Hey, kiddo.

01:33:20.303 --> 01:33:24.265
- I had a bad trip on The Drank.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:31.021
If anybody asks,
this is a Seeing Eye dog.

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.152
- Where's?
- She went home.

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:39.280
Right.

01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.286
I really don't like the Little Wayne.
Can't understand what he's saying.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:49.873
You know who I wish
was here right now?

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:51.583
Your mom.

01:33:52.419 --> 01:33:55.546
Yeah. Well, you left her, so...

01:33:58.008 --> 01:33:59.300
Why?

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:03.679
When you're married
and you do blow...

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:07.891
...try to stay away from women
who want to fuck you.

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:09.643
Even ugly women.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:13.272
Blow is blind, Adam.
Blow is blind.

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:15.774
You're an asshole.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:18.152
But you're not.

01:34:19.237 --> 01:34:24.366
You got a good heart, Adam.
Try to keep it.

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:27.828
Where's that girl, Emma?
You guys still together?

01:34:29.414 --> 01:34:33.500
- We were never together.
- Oh, that's right. Friends...

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:37.671
Sex friends... I'm old.
I don't know what you call it.

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.006
You liked her.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:45.012
She drives me crazy.

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:52.936
I'm 58 years old.
I've been married three times.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:54.897
Twice.

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:56.940
OK.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:35:01.278
I've got six pictures
of my cock on my phone,

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:03.113
and two of someone else's,

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:05.366
and I'm still pretty high
on the cough syrup,

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:07.910
so you can take this
with a grain of salt, but...

01:35:08.078 --> 01:35:11.955
...we don't pick
who we fall in love with.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:14.750
And it never happens like it should.

01:35:17.754 --> 01:35:19.004
Yes.

01:35:19.172 --> 01:35:24.760
I may have to kill this dog.
I just haven't decided how.

01:35:29.516 --> 01:35:31.392
Get some sleep, Dad.

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.813
I'll call you in the morning.

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:46.615
He'll call in the morning.

01:35:49.035 --> 01:35:50.619
Isn't that something?

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:53.497
Am I boring you?

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.207
Oh, good.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:12.182
Adam!

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:17.688
Hey. You can't call me
and tell me that you miss me.

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:20.482
I don't want to have
that conversation on the phone.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:24.027
So you can't text me
and you can't e-mail me,

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:27.865
and you can't... write on my wall.

01:36:28.032 --> 01:36:30.868
Like, if you really miss me,
you need to grow up

01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:34.288
and get in your car
and come and see me.

01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:36.874
I'm here.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.383
How did...
How did you know that?

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:50.387
Shira texted me about
your dad, so I came here.

01:36:56.102 --> 01:36:57.102
You got...

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:00.522
How is your dad?

01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:03.734
- He's OK.
- Good.

01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:09.907
- I know I can't just call you.
- No. You can't.

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:13.952
I know.
I hurt you. I'm sorry.

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:19.500
I don't know why I wasted so much time
pretending I didn't care.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:24.171
I guess I just didn't
want to feel like this.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:25.672
It hurts.

01:37:28.259 --> 01:37:30.761
But I love you. I'm totally
and completely in love with you,

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:34.306
and I don't care if you think it's
too late, I'm telling you anyway.

01:37:40.438 --> 01:37:42.814
- Will you please say something?
- Wait.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.528
You should know...

01:37:50.323 --> 01:37:52.783
...if you come any closer,

01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:55.452
I'm not letting you go.

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:09.633
- I love you.
- That's good.

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:20.227
You want to go with me
to this stupid thing?

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:23.814
Your sister's wedding thing?

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:27.150
How long do we have
till we have to be there?

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:29.695
A couple hours.

01:38:30.613 --> 01:38:34.825
- What do you want to do?
- Something crazy.

01:38:45.878 --> 01:38:47.879
Now I know why you never wanted
to have breakfast with me.

01:38:48.047 --> 01:38:49.339
What?

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:53.510
You eat like a baby dinosaur.
You don't even chew.

01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:57.180
Do you think you can get used to it?

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:58.348
Yeah, I think so.

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:01.351
Good. I was hoping
we could do this a lot more.

01:39:01.519 --> 01:39:05.147
Really?
You know, I was thinking...

01:39:05.315 --> 01:39:07.983
We're gonna have to come up
with some new rules.

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:11.028
I'd like to start calling you
"honey" and "babe."

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:14.281
- I don't know about "babe."
- No?

01:39:15.617 --> 01:39:16.950
- Snuggling?
- Oh, yeah.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:21.788
- I'm gonna hold your hand.
- Wow. This is all moving so fast.

01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:26.043
Also, I'd like to leave
the door open when I pee.

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:29.713
I think no.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:34.051
I think I'm gonna do it all the time.
It's gonna get weird.

01:39:56.407 --> 01:39:58.742
- Thank God we're on time.
- Yeah.

01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:17.594
So what happens now?

01:40:46.916 --> 01:40:49.710
- Adam should be here any minute.
- Good, 'cause I'm starving.

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:54.256
So, you've told him about us.

01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:57.634
- No, not yet.
- What?

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:00.929
I thought I'd wait till he got here.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.935
- And that's a good idea?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:09.312
So, to Burning Man?

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.982
- Was that fun, or what?
- So fun.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.067
Dad!

01:41:14.235 --> 01:41:15.819
Eli!

01:41:15.987 --> 01:41:17.237
This is her! This is Patrice!

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:20.323
Hi, it's so nice to see you again.

01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:24.786
- We love you already!
- Come on, family hug!

01:42:15.588 --> 01:42:19.132
Shira, I feel like there are parts of me
that I haven't explored yet.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:22.344
And I'm feeling like
I want to see other people.

01:42:22.512 --> 01:42:25.138
Oh, I thought...
This is embarrassing.

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:28.183
I have been seeing other people, Sam.

01:42:28.351 --> 01:42:30.685
- You have?
- Yeah, a lot of other people.

01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:32.270
How many?

01:42:32.438 --> 01:42:34.189
I don't know, man. I mean,

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:36.566
two that I can think of
off the top of my head, but...

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:39.069
- You remember when I went to Cabo?
- Yeah.

01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:42.197
