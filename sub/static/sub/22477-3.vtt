DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: <i>In a far corner</i>
<i>of South-East Asia,</i>

00:40.920 --> 00:43.435
<i>lies the Coral Triangle.</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:50.590
<i>A cluster of the richest coral reefs,</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

00:56.280 --> 01:00.035
<i>Undersea cities crammed full of life.</i>

01:06.720 --> 01:09.155
<i>As in any crowded metropolis,</i>

01:09.600 --> 01:12.354
<i>there is fierce rivalry for space,</i>

01:16.720 --> 01:17.995
<i>for food</i>

01:22.840 --> 01:24.160
<i>and for a partner.</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:30.553
<i>But the reef is also a place</i>
<i>full of opportunity.</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:44.876
<i>A cuttlefish.</i>

02:01.440 --> 02:05.480
<i>It specialises in hunting crabs.</i>

02:13.960 --> 02:17.271
<i>But a large crab is a dangerous quarry.</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:27.232
<i>It has powerful claws.</i>

02:31.200 --> 02:34.637
<i>The cuttlefish, however,</i>
<i>has a remarkable talent.</i>

02:40.480 --> 02:43.837
<i>Its skin contains millions</i>
<i>of pigment cells</i>

02:44.040 --> 02:46.509
<i>with which it can create</i>
<i>ever-changing colours</i>

02:46.600 --> 02:47.875
<i>and patterns.</i>

02:57.280 --> 03:01.160
<i>And that apparently hypnotises the crab.</i>

03:23.440 --> 03:25.033
<i>A cuttlefish may be clever,</i>

03:25.600 --> 03:27.159
<i>but a shark is bigger.</i>

03:29.920 --> 03:31.877
<i>And it eats cuttlefish.</i>

03:34.720 --> 03:36.200
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

03:52.400 --> 03:53.834
<i>Back to the hunt.</i>

03:56.920 --> 04:00.834
<i>A new target,</i>
<i>but the same mesmerising technique.</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:21.232
<i>For those that manage to establish</i>
<i>themselves in these bustling</i>

04:21.360 --> 04:22.714
<i>undersea cities,</i>

04:22.960 --> 04:25.520
<i>there can be great rewards.</i>

04:45.640 --> 04:48.917
<i>Corals build themselves</i>
<i>homes of limestone,</i>

04:49.080 --> 04:52.278
<i>in the warm, clear,</i>
<i>shallow seas of the Tropics.</i>

04:56.360 --> 04:58.920
<i>Their reefs occupy less than one tenth</i>

04:59.040 --> 05:01.999
<i>of one percent of the ocean floor.</i>

05:05.840 --> 05:08.230
<i>Yet, they're home to a quarter</i>

05:08.400 --> 05:10.710
<i>of all known marine species.</i>

05:15.280 --> 05:16.760
<i>They are complex,</i>

05:17.160 --> 05:19.470
<i>infinitely variant structures,</i>

05:20.400 --> 05:23.916
<i>providing all kinds of homes</i>
<i>for their many residents,</i>

05:27.040 --> 05:28.520
<i>from penthouse suites,</i>

05:30.400 --> 05:32.198
<i>to backstreet dens.</i>

05:38.200 --> 05:40.920
<i>Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,</i>

05:41.560 --> 05:45.270
<i>a coral grouper lives</i>
<i>by hunting for small fish.</i>

05:51.040 --> 05:52.793
<i>But how do you get a meal here,</i>

05:54.000 --> 05:56.720
<i>when you're too big</i>
<i>to squeeze into crevices?</i>

06:05.560 --> 06:08.792
<i>And the grouper also has a rival,</i>

06:13.200 --> 06:15.351
<i>one which is highly intelligent,</i>

06:20.160 --> 06:22.277
<i>and seeks the same kind of prey.</i>

06:25.200 --> 06:26.316
<i>An octopus.</i>

06:47.560 --> 06:51.395
<i>It can reach into really narrow cracks.</i>

06:59.800 --> 07:01.075
<i>Even so,</i>

07:01.560 --> 07:03.233
<i>its prey often escapes.</i>

07:15.160 --> 07:17.152
<i>What if they could work together?</i>

07:33.360 --> 07:35.477
<i>The grouper turns pale,</i>

07:39.720 --> 07:42.918
<i>and tries to attract</i>
<i>the octopus's attention.</i>

07:48.400 --> 07:50.073
<i>It performs a head stand.</i>

07:56.960 --> 07:59.998
<i>Not only is the grouper signalling</i>
<i>to the octopus,</i>

08:00.360 --> 08:03.194
<i>it's indicating</i>
<i>where the prey is hiding.</i>

08:16.480 --> 08:18.711
<i>The octopus reaches inside.</i>

08:22.440 --> 08:23.954
<i>The fish take fright.</i>

08:27.680 --> 08:31.754
<i>And swim straight into</i>
<i>the grouper's jaws.</i>

08:39.440 --> 08:42.000
<i>Sometimes, the octopus gets the reward,</i>

08:43.480 --> 08:46.075
<i>sometimes, the grouper does.</i>

08:51.640 --> 08:53.711
<i>Two very different species</i>

08:53.920 --> 08:57.596
<i>have discovered</i>
<i>that teamwork can bring success,</i>

08:57.800 --> 08:59.792
<i>in reef city.</i>

09:16.240 --> 09:19.756
<i>Teamwork, in fact,</i>
<i>is the very foundation of life</i>

09:19.920 --> 09:21.036
<i>on the reef.</i>

09:28.880 --> 09:32.840
<i>The corals themselves</i>
<i>also rely on a partnership.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:37.472
<i>But one of a much more intimate kind.</i>

09:46.040 --> 09:49.511
<i>Corals are colonies</i>
<i>of anemone-like animals,</i>

09:49.880 --> 09:50.996
<i>polyps.</i>

09:51.880 --> 09:54.759
<i>Some as small as grains of sand.</i>

09:57.600 --> 10:00.320
<i>Living inside the tissues of each polyp,</i>

10:00.800 --> 10:05.636
<i>are minute plant-like cells,</i>
<i>invisible to the naked eye.</i>

10:11.160 --> 10:14.039
<i>By day flourishing in tropical sunshine,</i>

10:14.400 --> 10:16.960
<i>the plant-like cells provide the polyps</i>

10:17.080 --> 10:19.879
<i>with up to 90% of their food.</i>

10:32.760 --> 10:36.197
<i>And when it's dark,</i>
<i>the polyps continue to feed</i>

10:36.520 --> 10:41.879
<i>by using their tentacles to grab</i>
<i>edible particles drifting by.</i>

10:49.760 --> 10:53.470
<i>The polyps also extract</i>
<i>calcium carbonate from the sea water,</i>

10:53.720 --> 10:57.509
<i>and use it to build a stony housing</i>
<i>for themselves.</i>

11:00.600 --> 11:04.116
<i>Coral colonies</i>
<i>can continue to grow for centuries.</i>

11:04.840 --> 11:06.320
<i>Possibly millennia.</i>

11:10.040 --> 11:14.557
<i>And they can build structures</i>
<i>that can reach the size of a house.</i>

11:29.680 --> 11:33.037
<i>The biggest of their cities,</i>
<i>is the Great Barrier Reef.</i>

11:34.520 --> 11:40.312
<i>It runs for over 1400 miles</i>
<i>along the coast of North East Australia.</i>

11:51.720 --> 11:56.078
<i>Activity in coral reefs,</i>
<i>wherever they are, never ceases.</i>

11:58.360 --> 12:00.795
<i>At dawn, the day shift begins.</i>

12:01.800 --> 12:06.192
<i>Accompanied by a chorus</i>
<i>of submarine song,</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:10.833
<i>created by fish, shrimps,</i>
<i>and other inhabitants of the reef.</i>

12:10.920 --> 12:14.755
(ETHEREALSEA SOUNDS)

12:24.920 --> 12:27.958
<i>Every resident in this city,</i>
<i>has its role.</i>

12:28.920 --> 12:31.151
<i>Scavengers, like the sea cucumber,</i>

12:31.360 --> 12:33.272
<i>recycle the waste of others.</i>

12:35.960 --> 12:38.634
<i>These parrot fish,</i>
<i>bite off chunks of coral</i>

12:38.720 --> 12:42.077
<i>and crunch it</i>
<i>to extract the contents.</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:57.239
<i>And then, excrete the rest as sand.</i>

13:13.120 --> 13:15.760
<i>Green turtles, here in Borneo,</i>

13:15.960 --> 13:19.840
<i>pay regular visits</i>
<i>to a particular patch of coral.</i>

13:25.240 --> 13:29.951
<i>This little female is up early</i>
<i>and one step ahead of the others.</i>

13:49.360 --> 13:53.718
<i>Turtles travel long distances along</i>
<i>the reef in order to get here.</i>

13:57.400 --> 13:59.551
<i>This is their destination.</i>

14:00.080 --> 14:01.514
<i>Turtle Rock.</i>

14:08.120 --> 14:12.558
<i>Generations of visiting turtles</i>
<i>have worn a hollow in its top.</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:28.674
<i>This is home to blennies</i>

14:29.760 --> 14:31.353
<i>and surgeon fish.</i>

14:32.840 --> 14:37.790
<i>They clean the visitors picking off</i>
<i>any algae, parasites and dead skin,</i>

14:37.920 --> 14:39.240
<i>that they can find.</i>

14:43.880 --> 14:46.679
<i>Other client are close behind.</i>

14:54.520 --> 14:56.477
<i>A queue is forming.</i>

15:13.000 --> 15:15.560
<i>The big males barge their way in.</i>

15:31.160 --> 15:34.631
<i>And the smaller female is forced out.</i>

15:43.360 --> 15:46.000
<i>She takes a quick turn around the block,</i>

15:51.320 --> 15:52.800
<i>while the others are squabbling.</i>

16:06.320 --> 16:08.630
<i>And then, she sneaks back in.</i>

16:20.440 --> 16:23.239
<i>So the cleaners get a nutritious meal,</i>

16:23.880 --> 16:28.272
<i>and their customers are freed of</i>
<i>their parasites and other encumbrances.</i>

16:33.600 --> 16:38.277
<i>And it's now thought, that a spot</i>
<i>of pampering at a cleaning station</i>

16:38.400 --> 16:40.357
<i>may even reduce stress.</i>

16:56.360 --> 16:59.751
<i>The lands of the Middle East</i>
<i>are so hot and dry,</i>

16:59.920 --> 17:02.799
<i>that much of their surface</i>
<i>is almost lifeless.</i>

17:04.839 --> 17:06.832
<i>But here in the Red Sea,</i>

17:07.359 --> 17:09.590
<i>Coral Reefs flourish wonderfully.</i>

17:12.839 --> 17:14.273
<i>The waters offshore,</i>

17:14.440 --> 17:17.512
<i>are almost as rich</i>
<i>in life as a rainforest.</i>

17:20.640 --> 17:22.757
<i>And some animals come to the reefs</i>

17:23.000 --> 17:26.071
<i>simply for rest and relaxation.</i>

17:45.800 --> 17:48.235
<i>The family of bottlenose dolphins</i>

<i>But, such games do that their value.</i>

20:08.680 --> 20:12.435
<i>They may help the youngsters develop</i>
<i>the coordination and the agility</i>

<i>that they will need when</i>
<i>they start hunting in the open sea.</i>

20:28.200 --> 20:31.477
<i>Every reef</i>
<i>has a sharply defined boundary.</i>

20:34.160 --> 20:35.958
<i>Its city walls.</i>

20:41.200 --> 20:44.238
<i>On the outer side is the drop off.</i>

<i>These ramparts protect the city</i>

<i>But twice a day, the walls are covered</i>

21:06.760 --> 21:11.630
<i>In the Bahamas, the rush of the water</i>
<i>creates a truly strange phenomenon.</i>

21:23.240 --> 21:27.029
<i>Seamen once told tales</i>
<i>of a giant sea monster,</i>

21:27.200 --> 21:29.590
<i>lurking here deep inside the reef,</i>

<i>that would drag sailors to their doom.</i>

<i>Today, we know it is in fact a whirlpool</i>
<i>created by the incoming tide</i>

22:18.320 --> 22:20.630
<i>one particular coral lagoon</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:23.230
<i>become so flooded with plankton,</i>

22:25.040 --> 22:28.556
<i>that it attracts hundreds</i>
<i>of ocean giants.</i>

<i>And the mantas create</i>
<i>a vortex of their own</i>

23:06.600 --> 23:08.876
<i>that further concentrates their food.</i>

23:51.720 --> 23:56.272
<i>This behaviour has been called</i>
<i>the manta cyclone.</i>

24:06.960 --> 24:09.077
<i>Then the tide changes,</i>

26:10.720 --> 26:11.915
<i>A bobbit,</i>

26:14.600 --> 26:16.432
<i>a giant carnivorous worm</i>

26:17.080 --> 26:19.231
<i>with jaws as sharp as daggers.</i>

26:23.440 --> 26:28.117
<i>It has an ancestry that stretches back</i>
<i>more than four hundred million years.</i>

26:36.000 --> 26:37.957
<i>It's a meter long.</i>

26:58.240 --> 27:01.551

<i>And feels for movement.</i>

28:33.800 --> 28:35.553
<i>Instead of retreating,</i>

<i>they join together to blow away</i>

<i>So, taking away</i>
<i>its advantage of surprise.</i>

28:56.040 --> 28:58.475
<i>By revealing the bobbit's hiding place,</i>

28:58.720 --> 29:01.155
<i>they will all be able</i>
<i>to feed more safely.</i>

29:05.200 --> 29:07.192
<i>But it pays to remember</i>

<i>there is a bobbit about.</i>

29:31.000 --> 29:33.071
<i>Out here, on the sand flats,</i>

<i>so they can shelter from danger.</i>

<i>In return, the fish keep the anemone</i>
<i>clean of debris.</i>

30:24.960 --> 30:26.553
<i>As with all clownfish,</i>

30:26.640 --> 30:29.838
<i>the family is ruled by a big female.</i>

<i>removing debris and generally keeping</i>
<i>on top of the housework.</i>
