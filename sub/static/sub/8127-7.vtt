              Hi.               

00:59.526 --> 01:00.925
     Michael, you're late.      
     Where have you been?       

01:00.927 --> 01:02.593
          Never mind.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.299
      So what? What do you      
  want me to wear, a leotard?   

01:08.301 --> 01:10.969
Michael, will you hurry up      
        and get dressed?        

01:10.971 --> 01:12.671
Ma, wouldn't you know it?       

01:12.673 --> 01:14.873
      The one night that we have
      tickets to the ballet,    

01:14.875 --> 01:16.074
        and he's got to be late.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.075
    Where's my purse?           

01:17.077 --> 01:18.076
        Oh, there it is.        

01:18.078 --> 01:19.310
             Hold still, Gloria.

01:19.312 --> 01:21.012
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma.              

01:21.014 --> 01:22.013
                    There.

My Cupid's Delight.             

01:29.222 --> 01:33.658
It's a new pie recipe           
I found in a magazine.          

01:33.660 --> 01:34.659
      Oh!                       

01:34.661 --> 01:36.627
How do you like it              
so far?                         

01:39.198 --> 01:40.398
          It's a nice crust, Ma.

             What are you       
             going to put in it?

01:42.268 --> 01:44.769
Oh, I'm going to put in         
spiced apples                   

01:44.771 --> 01:47.972
and spiced peaches              
and spiced raisins.             

01:47.974 --> 01:51.642
I hope it won't be              
too spicy for them.

         Them? Are you expecting
         company tonight?       

01:54.014 --> 01:55.747
Oh, no, not tonight.            

01:55.749 --> 01:59.984
Tomorrow night, we have         
very special company.           

01:59.986 --> 02:03.254
Mr. and Mrs. Rempley.

tomorrow night

for dessert and coffee.         

02:06.860 --> 02:09.327
That's why                      
I'm making the pie.             

02:09.329 --> 02:11.930
         Mr. and Mrs. Rempley...

02:11.932 --> 02:13.098
        Have I ever met them?   

02:13.100 --> 02:15.266
No. Neither have I.             

02:16.802 --> 02:18.569
             I don't understand.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.304
We're pen pals.                 

02:20.306 --> 02:22.707
        Ma, you got pen pals?   

02:22.709 --> 02:24.175
             I didn't know that.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.243
              From what country?

02:25.245 --> 02:27.078
Oh, they ain't from any country.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.013
    They're from New Jersey.    

02:31.450 --> 02:35.486
 They were in this              
 <i>Now Family</i> magazine.           

02:35.488 --> 02:38.389
See? I found it                 
on the subway.                  

02:38.391 --> 02:42.526
And right here, see,            
in the "swap" section,          

02:42.528 --> 02:46.564
where they swap                 
unusual things, you know,       

02:46.566 --> 02:49.234
and, well, here,                

02:49.236 --> 02:52.670
this is really                  
an unusual ad.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.368
Oh, yeah,                       
and just this morning,          

03:24.370 --> 03:26.604

from the wife,

Mrs. Ruth Rempley,              

03:28.408 --> 03:30.942
and she sounds                  
just like the ad,

affectionate and warm           
and fun-loving.                 

03:34.380 --> 03:37.215
    Ma, what would make you     
     write to these people?     

03:37.217 --> 03:38.683
    Well, Gloria,               

03:38.685 --> 03:41.953
since you started working,      
there's nobody to talk to,      

03:41.955 --> 03:44.989
and I thought it'd be nice      
to have somebody to write to.   

03:44.991 --> 03:46.791
          But, Ma, I don't think
          that these are--

03:52.032 --> 03:53.231

                 to your mother?

05:04.737 --> 05:07.272
Well, just tell her             
in plain simple English.        

05:07.274 --> 05:09.640
        Well, you tell her in...
        that English.

                     So what?   

05:13.013 --> 05:16.915
        You know just as much   
        about sex as I do. More!

05:16.917 --> 05:17.916
More?                           

05:17.918 --> 05:19.117
                I don't know.   

05:19.119 --> 05:20.919
Oh, come on, Michael.           
We'll tell her together.        

05:20.921 --> 05:21.920
            All right.          

05:21.922 --> 05:23.121
                 Only you start.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.255
Huh? Yeah, all right.           

05:24.257 --> 05:26.257

you help me.

something?                      

05:28.594 --> 05:30.395
             No, no, Ma. We're  
             in kind of a hurry,

05:30.397 --> 05:31.529
                so Michael's got
                something       

05:31.531 --> 05:32.630
                    he has to   
                    tell you.   

05:32.632 --> 05:34.365
Look, Ma...                     

05:34.367 --> 05:35.967
I'm stuck.

                 in the ad,     

05:40.373 --> 05:42.840
 you think they're just looking 
for friendship, don't you?      

05:42.842 --> 05:43.841
Yeah.                           

05:43.843 --> 05:45.476
                 Yeah, well,    
                 they're looking

05:45.478 --> 05:46.877
                for more than   
                friendship.     

05:46.879 --> 05:48.846

    of friendship.              

05:48.848 --> 05:50.181
              Oh.               

05:50.183 --> 05:52.716
          Well, I hope          
    I don't disappoint them.    

05:55.787 --> 05:59.958
 Ma, you got to tell            
 the Rempleys not to come.      

05:59.960 --> 06:01.359
              Why?              

06:01.361 --> 06:02.693
                Ma, trust me.   

06:02.695 --> 06:04.495
         This can't be explained
         in a couple of minutes,

06:04.497 --> 06:05.696
                and we really   
                have to run.    

06:05.698 --> 06:07.098
                We'll explain it

19:26.264 --> 19:27.263
                     Good night!

19:27.265 --> 19:29.766
Oh, no, Louise,                 
don't go!                       

19:29.768 --> 19:32.469
        I don't want to learn   
        nothing either!         

19:40.177 --> 19:42.613
All right,                      
picture time!                   

19:42.615 --> 19:44.114
                  Hey, what's   
                  that for?     

19:44.116 --> 19:46.382
Well, I thought we'd take       
  a couple of pictures before.  

19:46.384 --> 19:47.851
                Oh. Before what?

19:50.855 --> 19:52.555
You are funny.                  

19:52.557 --> 19:54.625
Isn't he a riot?                

19:54.627 --> 19:57.694
Well, I get off a good one      
every now and then.             

19:57.696 --> 20:00.097
What the hell                   
did I say?                      

20:00.099 --> 20:01.865
Archie, come here.              
I wanna show you something.     

20:01.867 --> 20:02.866
Come here.                      

20:02.868 --> 20:03.934
This is a picture               

20:03.936 --> 20:05.902
I took last week                
with some friends.              

20:05.904 --> 20:06.903
This one's                      
a little blurred                

20:06.905 --> 20:08.271
because we were moving.         

20:08.273 --> 20:09.640
I developed it myself.          

20:09.642 --> 20:11.374
            Oh. Yeah, let's see.

20:13.511 --> 20:15.445
                    Hey.        

20:15.447 --> 20:16.312
        Come here. Come here.   

20:18.883 --> 20:20.817
        You made a mistake here.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.352
             You got one of them
             stag pictures      

20:22.354 --> 20:23.553
            mixed up with       
            the regular ones.   

20:23.555 --> 20:25.155
          You don't want        
          your wife to see that.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.456
Oh, Ruthie don't mind.          

20:26.458 --> 20:27.658
That's her                      
in the picture.                 

20:41.139 --> 20:43.473
Edith, here.                    

20:43.475 --> 20:44.708
Let me show you something.      

20:44.710 --> 20:46.209
    This is one of me.          

20:46.211 --> 20:47.210
            Hold it!            

20:47.212 --> 20:48.645
             Whoa!              

20:48.647 --> 20:49.780
              No!               

20:49.782 --> 20:51.214
          Put it away!          

20:51.216 --> 20:54.851
        My wife ain't looking   
        at no part of you!      

20:54.853 --> 20:56.586
These are two                   
dirty people here.              

20:56.588 --> 20:57.721
CURTIS: What?                   

20:57.723 --> 20:59.189
RUTH: What are you              
talking about?                  

20:59.191 --> 21:02.392
I don't want no creepos,        
weirdos or sexos in my house.   

21:02.394 --> 21:03.660
    Come on, get out!           

21:03.662 --> 21:04.895
Get out of here.                

21:04.897 --> 21:06.429
Take all your junk              
with you.                       

21:06.431 --> 21:08.331
    Here's your purse, lady.    
        Here's the bag.         

21:08.333 --> 21:09.866
 Come on, out, out!             

21:09.868 --> 21:11.501
Hold it, hold it!               

21:11.503 --> 21:13.469
Ruthie and I just want          
to be friendly.                 

21:13.471 --> 21:14.871
We made friends                 
all over the country.           

21:14.873 --> 21:16.372
                Oh, well,       
                go back to them.

21:16.374 --> 21:18.909
              You got no friends
              to make here.     

21:18.911 --> 21:20.944
              Well, if you feel 
              that way about it,

21:20.946 --> 21:23.880
    then why did she answer     
    our ad in the magazine?     

21:23.882 --> 21:26.449
                Listen, she--   

21:26.451 --> 21:29.686
              You answered an ad
              in a magazine?    

21:29.688 --> 21:32.856
It sounded like                 
they needed us.                 

21:32.858 --> 21:37.360
Of course they needed us,       
      Edith, but for what?      

21:37.362 --> 21:38.962
For fun.                        

21:38.964 --> 21:39.963
             We ain't interested

21:39.965 --> 21:41.431
    in no kind of fun like that.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.033
     You're looking at a happily
     married couple here.       

21:43.035 --> 21:44.101
Well, you're looking            

21:44.103 --> 21:46.203
at a happily married            
couple here too.                

21:46.205 --> 21:47.604
ARCHIE: Aw...                   

21:47.606 --> 21:49.572
Well, I admit it                
wasn't always true.             

21:49.574 --> 21:50.707
There was a time                

21:50.709 --> 21:53.043
when our marriage               
got a little boring,            

21:53.045 --> 21:56.246
a little humdrum,               
a little...                     

21:56.248 --> 21:57.848
                Tedious.        

21:57.850 --> 21:59.682
                Well...         

21:59.684 --> 22:01.118
Then we discovered              
swinging.                       

22:01.120 --> 22:03.720
             "Swinging"? Is that
             what you call it?  

22:03.722 --> 22:05.155
            Yeah, why?          
            What do you call it?

22:06.323 --> 22:07.791
                Communism!      

22:12.496 --> 22:13.997
                Communism?      

22:13.999 --> 22:15.698
                You, buddy,     

22:15.700 --> 22:17.801
            are undermining     
            this nation here!   

22:17.803 --> 22:19.435
            You're telling me   

22:19.437 --> 22:21.537
                 I'm undermining
                 the nation?    

22:21.539 --> 22:23.206
              I'll have you know
              that I attended   

22:23.208 --> 22:26.476
            the Republican      
            National Convention!

22:27.711 --> 22:30.247
Well, I don't think             
that's the point.               

22:30.249 --> 22:33.616
Edith, maybe you                
can understand, dear.           

22:33.618 --> 22:36.486
  You see, our marriage was...  

22:36.488 --> 22:37.754
         Well, I mean,          

22:37.756 --> 22:40.556
      it just didn't seem       
    to matter much anymore.     

22:40.558 --> 22:43.459
Well, no more than the two cars 

22:43.461 --> 22:45.128
    or the new washer-dryer     

22:45.130 --> 22:48.765
    or the stereo set.          

22:48.767 --> 22:51.134
    We were drowning.           

22:51.136 --> 22:53.369
    Swinging saved us.          

22:53.371 --> 22:58.241
     I think I would rather     
         have drowned.          

22:58.243 --> 22:59.509
         Oh, I'm sorry.         

22:59.511 --> 23:00.710
                What do you mean
                you're sorry?   

23:00.712 --> 23:02.312
                What do you got 
                to be sorry for?

23:02.314 --> 23:03.479
                You're right!   

23:03.481 --> 23:05.581
     I seen enough of youse two.

23:05.583 --> 23:07.417
            Now am-scray!       

23:07.419 --> 23:10.120
                    Okay.       

23:10.122 --> 23:12.588
                To each his own,
                I suppose.      

23:12.590 --> 23:13.890
              I'll get          
              your coat, Ruthie.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.757
            Mm-hmm.             

23:17.561 --> 23:19.129
                 Well, it's like

23:19.131 --> 23:21.298
      that old expression       
        I made up once,         

23:21.300 --> 23:22.966
    remember, Ruthie?           

23:22.968 --> 23:24.634
    "I may disagree             
    with what you say,          

23:24.636 --> 23:26.169
    "but I'll defend            
    with my life                

23:26.171 --> 23:27.304
your right to say it."          

23:27.306 --> 23:28.404
                    Oh, yeah.   

23:28.406 --> 23:30.440
             I remember when you
             made that up too,  

23:30.442 --> 23:32.075
            you clever thing.   

23:32.077 --> 23:33.076
                Isn't he clever?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.077
Huh?                            

24:03.107 --> 24:06.142
             Don't you read     
        no more magazines!      

24:21.158 --> 24:22.492
        Now, what are you doing?

24:22.494 --> 24:24.127
        You ain't going         
        to keep that present.   

24:24.129 --> 24:25.461
Oh, no.                         

24:25.463 --> 24:30.466
      I'm going to mail it      
  right back to the Rempleys.   

24:30.468 --> 24:33.003
    What are you going to do    
    with your present?          

24:33.005 --> 24:37.040
     I'm going to do worse      
    than mail it back.          

24:37.042 --> 24:38.108
     I'm going to burn it.
