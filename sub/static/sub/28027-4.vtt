00:28.360 --> 00:31.160
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:31.320 --> 00:34.040
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.441
Time for a quick recap of the week.
It was a very busy one abroad,

00:37.601 --> 00:40.321
with North Korea reportedly
planning new missile launches,

00:40.481 --> 00:42.961
Theresa May still trying
to work out the Brexit mess,

00:43.121 --> 00:46.642
and Justin Trudeau up to his cheekbones
in a major scandal.

00:46.802 --> 00:49.922
But I'd like to focus
on what happened this week in Brazil;

00:50.082 --> 00:52.162
a country whose anaconda
don't want none

00:52.322 --> 00:55.722
unless it's a tourist who got
too close to the river.

00:55.882 --> 00:57.802
Carnival wrapped up
in Brazil this week,

00:57.962 --> 01:01.923
and Jair Bolsonaro, their new far-right
leader and sun-dried Frankie Muniz,

01:02.083 --> 01:06.323
got a lot of attention on Wednesday
for an unexpected attack on the event.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.443
The festivities have been
denounced as "debaucherous"

01:09.603 --> 01:11.604
by the President,
who tweeted a video

01:11.764 --> 01:13.804
apparently filmed at
a Carnival event showing

01:13.964 --> 01:17.124
one man urinating on another man
in a sexual act.

01:17.284 --> 01:18.844
We won't show the video.

01:19.004 --> 01:22.445
Oh, you're not, are you?
Well, guess what. We're not afraid.

01:22.605 --> 01:26.045
We are gonna show it to you,
except of course we're not.

01:26.205 --> 01:29.125
What are you cheering for?
No, we're not!

01:29.285 --> 01:30.605
This is HBO.

01:30.765 --> 01:33.725
This company doesn't show
debaucherous sex for the hell of it,

01:33.886 --> 01:36.486
unless a dragon is also there
to make it okay.

01:36.646 --> 01:38.046
That is the clear rule.

01:38.206 --> 01:41.166
What we'll do to give you a sense
of what the video contained,

01:41.326 --> 01:43.686
is utilize the YouTube channel
"Squirting Mustard."

01:43.846 --> 01:46.327
If you're not familiar with it,
and you're not,

01:46.487 --> 01:49.847
it's a series of videos of someone
squirting mustard on objects.

01:50.007 --> 01:52.887
So, to give you a basic idea
of what Bolsonaro tweeted,

01:53.047 --> 01:54.767
it was essentially this.

01:59.208 --> 02:03.368
That's it, and you can picture that in
your head for the rest of the segment,

02:03.528 --> 02:06.688
as well as every time you eat a hot dog
for the rest of your life.

02:06.848 --> 02:10.008
And as if tweeting out a golden shower
video weren't weird enough,

02:10.169 --> 02:12.449
Bolsonaro added the caption...

02:16.489 --> 02:18.129
Which, you know, can do, Jair.

02:18.289 --> 02:20.329
My comment is,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

02:20.489 --> 02:23.690
And my conclusion is,
"You're a terrible president."

02:23.850 --> 02:25.170
Why did Bolsonaro do this?

02:25.330 --> 02:29.210
He may have been angry that many of this
year's Carnival revelers roasted him.

02:29.370 --> 02:32.330
For instance, one city paraded
giant puppets of celebrities,

02:32.490 --> 02:35.731
and Bolsonaro's received
a decidedly mixed reaction,

02:35.891 --> 02:37.931
with crowds not just flipping it off

02:38.091 --> 02:39.931
<i>as it waddled through the streets,</i>

02:40.091 --> 02:44.051
<i>but also pelting it with so much beer,</i>
<i>it needed to be wiped down.</i>

02:44.211 --> 02:47.532
And it is not a great sign when your
puppet is singled out for abuse,

02:47.692 --> 02:49.492
especially when, for some reason,

02:49.652 --> 02:53.012
it's marching in a group that includes
a puppet Michael Jackson.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.732
And how much work must have
gone into that puppet

02:56.892 --> 03:00.373
that they still brought it out
after the documentary?

03:00.533 --> 03:02.373
"Look, I've already sunk
weeks into this.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.453
"The documentary doesn't
tell us anything

03:04.613 --> 03:06.533
"that as a society
we haven't been aware of

03:06.693 --> 03:09.334
"and repressed since 1993.
If you're getting angry now,

03:09.494 --> 03:11.974
"you're either disingenuously
riding the social wave,

03:12.134 --> 03:15.494
or you're incredibly
fucking naive. Carnival!"

03:15.654 --> 03:20.574
But honestly, a more likely reason
for Bolsonaro tweeting that video

03:20.734 --> 03:23.935
was probably an attempt
to change the conversation in Brazil,

03:24.095 --> 03:27.215
because things are not
going well there for him.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.695
He's only been in office
a little over two months,

03:29.855 --> 03:33.576
but his administration's
approval rating is at just 39%.

03:33.736 --> 03:36.056
So he could be trying
to deflect from that

03:36.216 --> 03:37.816
by going back to what he does best:

03:37.976 --> 03:40.456
Engaging in homophobic
cultural bullshit.

03:40.616 --> 03:42.216
It is very much his brand.

03:42.376 --> 03:46.257
And incredibly, despite all the blowback
he got for tweeting the video,

03:46.417 --> 03:48.737
he responded the next day
by tweeting,

03:48.897 --> 03:51.017
"What is a golden shower?"

03:51.177 --> 03:55.097
And you know it has been
a weird, weird week

03:55.257 --> 03:59.938
when the leader of 209 million
people is asking Twitter

04:00.098 --> 04:03.858
a question that you'd expect
Gayle King to be asking R. Kelly.

04:04.018 --> 04:08.178
So meanwhile, back home,
we were all dealing with Donald Trump,

04:08.338 --> 04:11.339
who will one day be remembered
by his great-great grandchildren

04:11.499 --> 04:14.019
as the reason they had to change
their last names.

04:14.179 --> 04:17.139
This week, the Trump TV show
we're all forced to live in

04:17.298 --> 04:20.059
jumped the shark for the 485th time.

04:20.219 --> 04:22.420
<i>The President and First Lady</i>
<i>stopped in Alabama,</i>

04:22.580 --> 04:24.500
<i>where they toured</i>
<i>some of the damage caused</i>

04:24.660 --> 04:27.020
<i>by tornadoes that killed 23 people.</i>

04:27.180 --> 04:29.740
<i>The President also stopping</i>
<i>at a Baptist church,</i>

04:29.900 --> 04:31.860
<i>and that is where he signed</i>
<i>several bibles.</i>

04:32.020 --> 04:34.541
<i>Administration officials say</i>
<i>people there asked him</i>

04:34.701 --> 04:37.621
<i>to autograph the bibles</i>
<i>and that he happily complied.</i>

04:37.781 --> 04:39.261
Of course he did.

04:39.421 --> 04:41.701
I am not remotely surprised
that Trump did that.

04:41.861 --> 04:45.462
I'm just slightly confused as to why
anyone would want him to.

04:45.622 --> 04:47.262
Seeing Trump's autograph on a bible

04:47.422 --> 04:49.342
should be like seeing
a picture of your mom

04:49.502 --> 04:51.662
on the cover
of a "Penthouse" magazine.

04:51.822 --> 04:53.662
It should render
the whole thing useless,

04:53.822 --> 04:55.862
and if you keep reading
after discovering it,

04:56.022 --> 04:58.063
you're going directly to hell.

04:58.223 --> 05:01.223
And look, some people there
clearly wanted his autograph,

05:01.383 --> 05:03.263
and presidents have signed
bibles before.

05:03.423 --> 05:06.623
But Trump didn't just sign the book,
he signed the cover.

05:06.783 --> 05:09.664
And it is weird to sign
the cover of any book,

05:09.824 --> 05:13.904
and weirder still to sign the cover
of The Bible with this signature.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.064
'Cause I don't care what
your name is,

05:16.224 --> 05:18.104
that is not how you sign something.

05:18.264 --> 05:20.064
That's how you test that
your Sharpie

05:20.224 --> 05:23.305
still has ink left
before you sign something.

05:23.465 --> 05:25.945
I know it's easy to make jokes
about how Donald Trump

05:26.105 --> 05:28.945
has no idea what's inside a bible,
but that is only because,

05:29.105 --> 05:30.865
as we learned when
he ran for president,

05:31.025 --> 05:34.546
he really has no idea
what is inside a bible.

05:34.706 --> 05:37.666
You've been talking about how
The Bible is your favorite book.

05:37.826 --> 05:40.986
You said, I think last night in Iowa,
some are surprised by that.

05:41.146 --> 05:44.227
I'm wondering what one or two
of your most favored

05:44.387 --> 05:45.907
bible verses are and why?

05:46.067 --> 05:48.307
I don't want to get into it,
it's very personal.

05:48.467 --> 05:51.747
When I talk about The Bible,
it's very personal, I don't wanna get--

05:51.907 --> 05:56.028
There's no verse that means a lot to you
that you think about or cite?

05:56.188 --> 05:59.348
The Bible means a lot to me,
but I don't wanna get into specifics.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.508
- Even to cite a verse you like?
- No.

06:01.668 --> 06:04.068
You an Old Testament guy
or a New Testament guy?

06:04.228 --> 06:05.708
Probably equal.

06:07.348 --> 06:12.829
Goddamn it, that is funny.
But think about what you're laughing at.

06:12.989 --> 06:16.189
That is a future president joyfully
and transparently lying

06:16.349 --> 06:18.109
about The Bible being his favorite book

06:18.269 --> 06:21.670
and being unable to name
a single passage from it.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.670
Which is amazing, 'cause just try.

06:23.830 --> 06:25.990
"Let there be light."
"Do unto others..."

06:26.150 --> 06:27.510
"God bless us every one."

06:27.670 --> 06:30.910
That's "A Christmas Carol,"
but I think we'd all let him have it.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.431
That exchange is emblematic
of something that happens a lot.

06:34.591 --> 06:36.751
It's Trump being a terrible
human being,

06:36.911 --> 06:40.391
dangerously idiotic, and yet somehow,
undeniably funny.

06:40.551 --> 06:45.312
And it happened again on Wednesday,
when he said this to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.112
You've really put a big
investment in our country.

06:48.272 --> 06:50.512
We appreciate it very much,
Tim Apple.

06:50.672 --> 06:53.752
Yeah, yeah.
He called him Tim Apple.

06:53.912 --> 06:57.993
Which, yes, yes, it's ridiculous.
But also, of course he did,

06:58.153 --> 07:01.233
'cause as far as Trump knows,
all companies are inherited.

07:01.393 --> 07:05.193
How else would a person
become CEO unless his father,

07:05.353 --> 07:08.714
Fred Apple, had founded
a company using the family name

07:08.874 --> 07:11.674
and eventually handed it off
to his son, Tim Apple?

07:11.834 --> 07:13.874
Isn't that how all businesses work?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.874
But look, that is a funny mistake.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.714
It's also genuinely worrying,
but it is funny.

07:18.874 --> 07:21.555
It's something I think
we all wrestle with at some point.

07:21.715 --> 07:23.955
How can a black-hearted moral vacuum

07:24.115 --> 07:26.755
somehow retain the ability
to make us laugh

07:26.915 --> 07:28.875
in spite of everything
he's said and done?

07:29.035 --> 07:32.956
It's almost impressive. He called
white nationalists "very fine people,"

07:33.116 --> 07:34.436
which is horrifying.

07:34.596 --> 07:37.836
But he also tweeted "hamberders,"
and I'm not saying that

07:37.996 --> 07:39.956
cancels the first one out--
it doesn't--

07:40.116 --> 07:44.357
but it succeeds despite it, which,
in a way, is even more impressive.

07:44.517 --> 07:46.437
Do you know how funny you have to be

07:46.597 --> 07:49.477
to make people laugh
after co-signing on Nazis?

07:49.637 --> 07:52.677
I'll tell you.
You've gotta be "hamberder" funny.

07:52.837 --> 07:55.118
And Trump manages to do this
on a regular basis,

07:55.278 --> 07:58.318
like when he referred to
the Speaker of the House like this.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.758
Nancy Pelosi, or Nancy,
as I call her.

08:01.918 --> 08:06.638
Of course you call her Nancy.
Everyone calls her Nancy.

08:06.798 --> 08:08.959
It's her fucking name!

08:09.119 --> 08:10.919
I don't know if that's a joke or not,

08:11.079 --> 08:13.479
and it doesn't matter
at the end of the day.

08:13.639 --> 08:16.119
'Cause it's moments like these
where the line between

08:16.279 --> 08:18.399
"Donald Trump,
actual President of the US,"

08:18.559 --> 08:21.480
and "Adam Sandler starring
in a '90s comedy with the premise,

08:21.640 --> 08:24.680
"'What if the worst person
in the world was the President?'"

08:24.840 --> 08:28.360
completely disappears. And it somehow
becomes physically confusing.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.240
You can feel your spirit sinking

08:30.400 --> 08:33.400
and your giggles rising
at the exact same time.

08:33.561 --> 08:35.640
Because in the midst
of botching the response

08:35.801 --> 08:39.160
to a devastating hurricane
in Puerto Rico, Trump said this.

08:39.321 --> 08:41.520
This is an island...

08:41.681 --> 08:44.642
surrounded by water.

08:44.802 --> 08:46.962
Big water.
Ocean water.

08:47.122 --> 08:49.882
Oh, fuck you.
You got me again!

08:50.042 --> 08:53.962
You did "big water" as the setup,
and then you drop "ocean water" on me?

08:54.122 --> 08:57.083
A++, you pile of shit.

08:57.243 --> 08:59.003
There are so many moments like that

08:59.163 --> 09:02.763
from the time he walked onto Air Force
One with toilet paper to his shoe

09:02.923 --> 09:05.683
to when he pronounced
regulators, "regul-a-tors,"

09:05.843 --> 09:07.764
like they were some kind
of dinosaur,

09:07.924 --> 09:10.924
to this incredible
foreign policy statement.

09:11.084 --> 09:14.764
China has total respect
for Donald Trump

09:14.924 --> 09:19.765
and for Donald Trump's
very, very large a-brain.

09:19.925 --> 09:24.645
Goddamn it, that is spectacular.
Not only did you refer to yourself

09:24.805 --> 09:27.765
in the third person twice,
but you ended a sentence

09:27.925 --> 09:32.006
in which you're trying to come across
as a statesman with the word "a-brain."

09:32.166 --> 09:35.766
Just imagine if any other
president had done that.

09:35.926 --> 09:39.206
"A house divided cannot
a-stand."

09:39.366 --> 09:42.206
"Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this a-wall."

09:42.367 --> 09:46.487
"Speak softly and carry
a very large a-stick."

09:46.647 --> 09:50.767
It is the "my wife" cadence,
and he's doing it at the fucking U.N.

09:50.927 --> 09:54.408
I am actively ashamed of how funny
I still find him at times,

09:54.568 --> 09:56.768
and I cannot be alone
in struggling with this.

09:56.928 --> 09:59.608
It's an emotion specific
to the Trump era,

09:59.768 --> 10:02.408
much like that rush
of excitement followed by futility

10:02.568 --> 10:04.088
anytime that he's caught in a lie.

10:04.248 --> 10:07.529
We actually tried to embody that
with our "We Got Him" button,

10:07.689 --> 10:10.449
which summoned a banner
and a dunking tiger.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.409
But when he somehow manages
to make us laugh,

10:13.569 --> 10:16.169
it's a feeling close
to the opposite of that.

10:16.329 --> 10:17.769
Whether he's saying "Tim Apple"

10:17.929 --> 10:21.610
or bragging about being on a first name
basis with Nancy Pelosi,

10:21.770 --> 10:24.010
we have to say, reluctantly,

10:24.170 --> 10:26.810
in spite of ourselves, he got us.

10:26.970 --> 10:28.530
He got us.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.931
He did, he did. He got us.
He got us.

10:31.091 --> 10:33.251
I don't like it either,
but he got us.

10:33.411 --> 10:37.491
To him, I say, check-a-mate,
you fucking monster.

10:37.651 --> 10:39.811
And now this.

10:39.971 --> 10:44.212
<i>And now, Rachael Ray's audience</i>
<i>really likes cheese.</i>

10:44.372 --> 10:50.412
And then finish it off with a nice
drizzle of wine and cheese sauce.

10:52.892 --> 10:56.133
With the cheese literally
coming out the sides. Look at that.

10:56.293 --> 10:57.933
I know!

10:58.093 --> 11:00.493
Who likes cheese balls?
I love cheese balls.

11:00.653 --> 11:02.533
Cheese balls!

11:02.693 --> 11:05.734
Some Parmigiano
or pecorino cheese.

11:07.494 --> 11:09.854
With a lot of Swiss cheese.

11:12.414 --> 11:15.894
Take a piece of provolone cheese

11:16.054 --> 11:19.455
and nest it in the meatball.

11:19.615 --> 11:21.175
Yeah.

11:21.335 --> 11:22.655
How cute is that?

11:22.815 --> 11:29.415
And hello, the cheese,
feta, baby, feta. Whoo!

11:29.576 --> 11:32.376
You need a fair amount
of cheese on top.

11:33.496 --> 11:35.496
- Double the cheese!
- Double cheese!

11:35.656 --> 11:37.416
You want some of this cheese
on the top?

11:37.576 --> 11:39.736
Yes, please!
Gimme some of that cheese.

11:39.896 --> 11:42.097
Oh, more cheese.

11:42.257 --> 11:44.337
Let's add some cheese.
Handful of it.

11:44.497 --> 11:45.817
Cheese.
Parm cheese.

11:45.977 --> 11:48.377
Cheese!
Cheese!

11:48.537 --> 11:50.777
-Cheese.
-Yeah.

12:02.098 --> 12:06.659
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns robocalls,

12:06.819 --> 12:08.739
tied for "most annoying type
of phone call"

12:08.899 --> 12:11.019
with every other type of phone call.

12:11.179 --> 12:13.019
Robocalls are clearly infuriating.

12:13.179 --> 12:16.779
Every one of us has answered our phone
at some point to hear this.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.060
<i>It is urgent that you contact us</i>

12:22.220 --> 12:25.860
<i>concerning your eligibility for lowering</i>
<i>your interest rates.</i>

12:37.381 --> 12:40.981
It was the pause in that last one
that made it a real cliffhanger.

12:41.142 --> 12:42.862
You basically knew where it was going,

12:43.022 --> 12:45.982
but there was a chance they were calling
people to inform them

12:46.142 --> 12:49.142
that the IRS was filing lawsuits
against... Nicolas Cage.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.262
Which you assume is always true,

12:51.422 --> 12:53.983
but a call to confirm every now
and then would be nice.

12:54.143 --> 12:56.863
The point is, everybody is
annoyed by robocalls.

12:57.023 --> 12:59.263
Hatred of them might be
the only thing that

12:59.423 --> 13:01.423
everyone in America agrees on now.

13:01.583 --> 13:05.544
And if you're feeling like you've been
getting more recently, you're right.

13:05.704 --> 13:11.784
Robocalls increased by 57% in 2018
to nearly 50 billion calls,

13:11.944 --> 13:14.504
and it's understandably
pissing people off.

13:14.664 --> 13:17.345
The plague of robocalls
is getting worse.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.345
<i>They're the number one</i>
<i>consumer complaint</i>

13:19.505 --> 13:21.425
<i>to the Federal Communications</i>
<i>Commission,</i>

13:21.585 --> 13:24.625
<i>which receives more than</i>
<i>200,000 protests a year.</i>

13:24.785 --> 13:29.866
<i>Robocalls make up roughly 60%</i>
<i>of all complaints to the FCC.</i>

13:30.026 --> 13:33.666
60% of all complaints
to the FCC are about robocalls,

13:33.826 --> 13:36.066
so they're definitely aware
of the problem.

13:36.226 --> 13:40.146
It's like the actual tea salon
in Vancouver called Neverland.

13:40.306 --> 13:43.787
By this point, they definitely know
they have a real issue.

13:43.947 --> 13:47.267
The only question is, what the fuck
are they gonna do about it?

13:47.427 --> 13:50.067
The nuisance of robocalls
has gotten to the point where

13:50.227 --> 13:53.588
even local news reports
about them get interrupted.

13:53.748 --> 13:55.948
- What's that? Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

13:56.108 --> 13:59.468
<i>We can't even get through an interview</i>
<i>without an unwanted phone call.</i>

13:59.628 --> 14:03.428
-I'm getting a robocall right now.
<i>-Ugh, there you go.</i>

14:03.588 --> 14:06.149
<i>As I was preparing</i>
<i>this report, I got one.</i>

14:06.309 --> 14:08.629
<i>Because you are qualified</i>
<i>for lower rates.</i>

14:08.789 --> 14:11.869
It is just not often that a news report
gets interrupted

14:12.029 --> 14:13.669
by the subject of that report.

14:13.829 --> 14:16.830
"Is your teenager getting involved
in a strange new sex trend?

14:16.990 --> 14:20.110
"It's called watermeloning,
and it involves--goddamn it.

14:20.270 --> 14:23.270
Can you not do this
somewhere else?"

14:23.950 --> 14:29.751
Let's look at why robocalls are on the
rise and what can be done about them.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.831
Let's start with a basic definition.

14:31.991 --> 14:34.791
Robocalls are any call
where you hear a recording

14:34.951 --> 14:39.151
or a robot voice, or when a machine
automatically dialed your number,

14:39.311 --> 14:41.552
even if there is a real person
on the other end.

14:41.712 --> 14:44.112
While a small percentage
of robocalls may be useful,

14:44.272 --> 14:47.472
calls about things like school closings
or prescription reminders,

14:47.632 --> 14:52.032
the vast majority of them vary from
the irritating to the outright illegal.

14:52.193 --> 14:55.513
And you'd be surprised to know
how many major companies are involved.

14:55.673 --> 14:58.593
A list of top robocallers
includes Capital One,

14:58.753 --> 15:00.433
Comcast, and Wells Fargo;

15:00.593 --> 15:02.953
all of whom use robocalls
to chase debts.

15:03.113 --> 15:06.874
And sometimes they do that a lot,
as this woman can testify.

15:07.034 --> 15:08.594
<i>Lea Bourgeois never suspected</i>

15:08.754 --> 15:10.794
<i>one late mortgage payment</i>
<i>would trigger</i>

15:10.954 --> 15:13.994
<i>what she considers</i>
<i>an avalanche of harassment.</i>

15:14.154 --> 15:17.395
It came and I just--blew me away.

15:17.555 --> 15:21.075
<i>Lea's attorney say they've logged</i>
<i>over 6,000 calls from Wells Fargo</i>

15:21.235 --> 15:23.475
<i>to their client</i>
<i>over the last four years.</i>

15:23.635 --> 15:25.515
<i>Some days, such as in January,</i>

15:25.675 --> 15:29.596
<i>Lea says Wells Fargo rang her</i>
<i>more than 20 times a day.</i>

15:29.756 --> 15:31.796
That's absolutely ridiculous.

15:31.956 --> 15:35.596
What's the point of calling someone
20 times a day to collect a debt?

15:35.756 --> 15:39.596
"This is actually great timing, 'cause
while I couldn't pay you 45 minutes ago,

15:39.757 --> 15:42.637
"a small propeller plane
full of unlaundered drug money

15:42.797 --> 15:44.317
"just crashed into my den.

15:44.477 --> 15:48.037
Thanks so much for the call,
you ravenous ghouls."

15:48.197 --> 15:51.758
But as you undoubtedly know, it is not
just major companies who do this.

15:51.918 --> 15:55.318
Phone calls are so cheap
and the technology so widely available,

15:55.478 --> 15:59.518
that just about anyone has the ability
to place a massive number of calls.

15:59.678 --> 16:01.678
-You created a program on your laptop.
-Yes.

16:01.838 --> 16:04.999
I'm gonna hit a button,
and the calls should start hitting.

16:05.159 --> 16:06.799
All at once.

16:07.519 --> 16:10.159
-This is insane; they're all ringing.
-Yep.

16:10.319 --> 16:13.679
That's both very impressive
and, when you really think about it,

16:13.839 --> 16:15.880
not actually that impressive at all.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.000
It's basically the finale trick from the
world's least amusing birthday magician.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.240
"Ta-da! Wait, nothing?
Well, guess what.

16:22.400 --> 16:26.280
"The Great Laptop-Dini got paid
in advance, so fuck all of you."

16:26.440 --> 16:29.601
And if you're thinking,
"What about the 'do not call' list?"

16:29.761 --> 16:33.641
It still exists, and very occasionally,
a big company like Dish Network

16:33.801 --> 16:35.521
gets fined millions for violating it.

16:35.681 --> 16:39.842
The problem is it only applies to one
particular kind of call, sales calls.

16:40.002 --> 16:43.442
And the list doesn't physically
block companies from calling you;

16:43.602 --> 16:46.122
they're just supposed to check it
before doing so,

16:46.282 --> 16:48.042
and scammers generally ignore it.

16:48.202 --> 16:50.042
First, because they're scammers,

16:50.202 --> 16:52.923
and second, 'cause it's now easy
to conceal their identity

16:53.083 --> 16:54.523
with something called "spoofing."

16:54.683 --> 16:56.003
I'll let Senator Susan Collins

16:56.163 --> 16:59.443
show you how it works
in the most awkward possible way.

16:59.603 --> 17:03.644
My screen is reading
"Internal Revenue Service."

17:03.804 --> 17:06.204
Well, let's see.

17:06.364 --> 17:08.884
Hello, this is Susan Collins.

17:09.044 --> 17:11.404
May I ask who is calling?

17:11.564 --> 17:15.044
Hello, Chairman Collins,
this is Sam Dewey from your staff.

17:15.204 --> 17:20.005
-Are you calling from the IRS?
-No, Senator, I'm actually over here.

17:26.724 --> 17:28.326
Cool.

17:28.486 --> 17:31.046
Spoofing is actually
the perfect technology

17:31.206 --> 17:33.726
for Susan Collins to be demonstrating.
Think about it:

17:33.886 --> 17:36.046
it's all about pretending to be
one thing

17:36.206 --> 17:39.527
and then disappointing everyone
when you reveal who you actually are.

17:39.687 --> 17:42.207
But despite sounding like
Urban Dictionary slang

17:42.367 --> 17:46.967
for when magicians shoot heroin,
spoofing is undeniably effective.

17:47.127 --> 17:49.967
Robocallers can pretend to be
calling from your area,

17:50.127 --> 17:52.128
increasing the chance
that you will pick up.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.488
And individual scammers can
even pretend to be

17:54.648 --> 17:57.688
someone that you know,
as one reporter found out.

17:57.848 --> 18:00.128
<i>Cybersecurity expert Jim Stickley</i>

18:00.288 --> 18:04.769
<i>sets up his phone to call my mom</i>
<i>posing as me.</i>

18:04.929 --> 18:06.329
Here we go.

18:07.609 --> 18:09.449
<i>- Hi, Jeff.</i>
- Hey, Mom, real quick,

18:09.609 --> 18:11.929
I need your social security number
for some forms.

18:12.089 --> 18:13.969
-Can you help me out?
<i>-For what?</i>

18:14.129 --> 18:17.810
I got this beneficiary form to fill out.
What's your social security number?

18:17.970 --> 18:21.050
<i>Uh...</i>

18:21.210 --> 18:22.810
Great, thanks a lot, Mom.
Love you.

18:22.970 --> 18:25.810
That was it.
I've got her social security number.

18:25.970 --> 18:29.931
Holy shit. Literally everything
about that was upsetting.

18:30.091 --> 18:33.371
From the fact that Jeff Rossen
had someone scam his own mother

18:33.531 --> 18:35.291
to the fact that she fell for it

18:35.451 --> 18:39.252
to his amazing reaction when he realizes
his mother did something stupid

18:39.412 --> 18:43.292
to his bold choice to broadcast his own
mother's stupidity on national TV

18:43.452 --> 18:47.092
to the fact that this man told another
man's mother that he loves her

18:47.252 --> 18:48.972
to the revelation
that he thinks Rossen

18:49.132 --> 18:51.933
sounds like a middle-aged man
squeezing his own balls

18:52.093 --> 18:55.493
to the fact that Jeff Rossen
could really use a new shirt.

18:55.653 --> 18:59.493
The point is, there's a lot
happening in that clip

18:59.653 --> 19:01.173
and none of it is good.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.734
Also, a quick side note on that:

19:03.894 --> 19:07.574
his mother's social security number
wasn't bleeped to protect her identity.

19:07.734 --> 19:10.174
It had to be censored because it's:

19:10.334 --> 19:14.375
"Fuck shit fuck-cock twat-taint
jizz shit tits."

19:14.535 --> 19:16.775
It wasn't her choice.
It wasn't her choice.

19:16.935 --> 19:19.295
Blame the Social Security
Administration.

19:19.455 --> 19:21.375
And thanks to all these new tactics,

19:21.535 --> 19:25.735
the onslaught in scam phone calls
is huge, and it's only getting worse.

19:25.895 --> 19:27.936
<i>Next year, some estimates predict</i>

19:28.096 --> 19:32.456
<i>half of all mobile calls</i>
<i>will be scam calls.</i>

19:32.616 --> 19:36.016
Wow. And that is a real problem
for consumers,

19:36.176 --> 19:38.057
because you have to use your phone.

19:38.217 --> 19:42.217
We can't go back to the days where
people shouted their message into a jar

19:42.377 --> 19:44.537
and then mailed it across the country.

19:44.697 --> 19:46.137
That was a terrible system,

19:46.297 --> 19:49.657
as it was only marginally more accurate
than having AT&T now.

19:49.817 --> 19:51.938
Oh! You like that, business daddy?

19:52.098 --> 19:55.698
Johnny's acting up again.
Johnny's acting up.

19:55.858 --> 19:58.578
Oh, I bet I'm gonna get
some spicy jars

19:58.738 --> 20:01.378
in the mail about that.
Whoo!

20:01.538 --> 20:05.819
The point is, what can we do about this?
Well, on a personal level,

20:05.979 --> 20:09.139
you can tell companies
you do business with not to call you.

20:09.299 --> 20:13.059
By law, they're not allowed
to robocall your cell without consent.

20:13.219 --> 20:15.100
But that is where this gets tricky,

20:15.260 --> 20:17.620
because those user agreements
that you agree to--

20:17.780 --> 20:20.180
you know, the ones that
no one has ever read--

20:20.340 --> 20:22.900
they often give companies
consent to robocall you

20:23.060 --> 20:25.741
and can make revoking it
incredibly difficult.

20:25.901 --> 20:30.261
If you're a customer of Credit One Bank
and want them to stop robocalling you,

20:30.421 --> 20:34.301
just take out your user agreement
and turn to page four, section 19-C,

20:34.461 --> 20:37.021
where you'll find that you have
to physically mail them

20:37.181 --> 20:39.902
written notice featuring
your name, mailing address,

20:40.062 --> 20:44.022
and the last four digits of your account
number to this P.O. box in Nevada.

20:44.182 --> 20:47.302
And it makes total sense why
you would opt not to do that.

20:47.462 --> 20:50.223
I would rather receive
1,000 phone calls a day

20:50.383 --> 20:54.263
every day for the rest of my life
than go out and buy a stamp.

20:54.423 --> 20:57.423
I mean, how the fuck
would I even do that?

20:57.583 --> 21:00.583
Do I have to go to a post office,
or can I go to a Walgreens?

21:00.743 --> 21:04.504
And If I can go to a Walgreens,
is it all the Walgreenses or just some?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.624
If it's just some, how do I find out
which ones? Call?

21:07.784 --> 21:10.504
Literally call a place
of business with my telephone

21:10.664 --> 21:13.505
and ask them if they could
sell me a stamp? Then what?

21:13.665 --> 21:15.705
I have to physically walk
to the Walgreens?

21:15.865 --> 21:18.865
Literally, physically walk,
like, with my legs?

21:19.025 --> 21:21.105
Then wait in line and buy the stamp?

21:21.265 --> 21:22.825
What now?
Put it in a mailbox?

21:22.985 --> 21:25.546
Where the fuck am I gonna find
a mailbox?

21:25.706 --> 21:29.306
The only mailboxes I ever see
are those weird boarded-up green ones.

21:29.466 --> 21:31.386
What the fuck are those things,
by the way?

21:31.546 --> 21:33.466
They're spooky,
that's what they are.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.906
It looks like a memorial
of a past mailbox that died in a war.

21:37.066 --> 21:40.547
So now I have to find the one mailbox
in New York City that hasn't

21:40.707 --> 21:44.627
sacrificed its life for this country,
pry open its big, hungry mail mouth,

21:44.787 --> 21:47.467
and shove a stamped envelope
down its dusty throat?

21:47.627 --> 21:50.908
Not gonna happen! I'd rather die
than engage in that nonsense,

21:51.068 --> 21:53.948
and deep down,
I think you fucking know that.

21:54.428 --> 21:57.348
So it is no wonder
that some people choose to

21:57.508 --> 22:00.188
simply mess with robocallers,
as one journalist did

22:00.348 --> 22:04.029
when he noticed the person on
the other end sounded a bit suspicious.

23:00.073 --> 23:04.034
That man is dead now.
She killed him, she stole his skin,

23:04.194 --> 23:07.114
she walks among us,
and she'll kill again.

23:07.274 --> 23:11.874
But as fun as that is, experts advise
you not to engage with robocalls at all.

23:12.034 --> 23:14.675
Don't pick up,
and don't talk if you do answer.

23:14.835 --> 23:17.035
That lets them know
that yours is a live number,

23:17.195 --> 23:18.875
and you'll get robocalled more.

23:19.035 --> 23:20.635
The much bigger point here is,

23:20.795 --> 23:24.275
it should not entirely be up to us
to deal with this bullshit.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.956
The FCC has the authority
to police robocalls.

23:27.116 --> 23:29.796
A few years back,
they put some guardrails in place

23:29.956 --> 23:31.876
with a set of rules
designed to limit them.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.276
As the FCC's former Chair
explained at the time,

23:34.436 --> 23:36.997
they basically followed
a simple principle.

23:37.157 --> 23:40.117
The consumer needs to be
the one who's in charge.

23:40.277 --> 23:44.677
The consumer needs to give consent
that they want to be called,

23:44.837 --> 23:47.637
or if they are called
and haven't given consent,

23:47.797 --> 23:50.518
to remove that consent by saying,

23:50.678 --> 23:53.838
"Don't call me anymore,"
or by calling their phone company

23:53.998 --> 23:56.598
and saying, "I don't wanna get
these calls."

23:56.758 --> 23:58.838
And that sounds completely
reasonable,

23:58.998 --> 24:03.119
but unfortunately, those rules were then
struck down after a trade group sued.

24:03.279 --> 24:06.599
At which point, robocalls
increased significantly.

24:06.759 --> 24:11.039
So, we made real progress toward
addressing a problem, then we blew it.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.440
We basically got
our one-year sobriety chip

24:13.600 --> 24:17.200
then celebrated by drinking
a gallon of Captain Morgan.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.360
Which is not to say
there aren't things the FCC could do.

24:20.520 --> 24:24.041
Unfortunately, their current Chair
is this guy, Ajit Pai.

24:24.201 --> 24:28.121
You've probably seen him on this show
before, alongside his stupid mug.

24:28.281 --> 24:32.481
And by the way...cheers.
Cheers to you.

24:32.641 --> 24:35.321
Now, Pai says a lot
of the right things about this.

24:35.481 --> 24:38.482
He said that robocalls are
"The scourge of civilization."

24:38.642 --> 24:40.282
And he's had a little too much fun

24:40.442 --> 24:43.282
showing how dedicated he is
to tackling this issue.

24:43.442 --> 24:46.082
To borrow from
former President Kennedy:

24:46.242 --> 24:50.323
"Let every robocaller know
whether it wishes us well or ill,

24:50.483 --> 24:53.283
"that we shall pay any price,
bear any burden,

24:53.443 --> 24:56.003
"meet any hardship,
support any solution,

24:56.163 --> 24:59.403
and oppose any bot
to assure the survival..."

24:59.563 --> 25:02.404
"...And the peace
of American consumers."

25:03.684 --> 25:06.924
Uh... It sounds like I may have
just won a cruise.

25:07.084 --> 25:09.644
So if you'll excuse me,
I have to take this call.

25:09.804 --> 25:11.925
But thank you very much,
Mr. Chairman.

25:12.085 --> 25:13.485
Oh.

25:14.685 --> 25:17.885
Ladies and gentlemen,
that man is a goober.

25:18.045 --> 25:21.925
And Ajit Pai clearly has aspirations
for higher political office,

25:22.085 --> 25:24.046
but I'd argue
that it's not gonna work out.

25:24.206 --> 25:27.126
Because Americans can, have,
and will elect bastards,

25:27.286 --> 25:31.246
morons, blowhards,
crooks, perverts, dipshits,

25:31.406 --> 25:33.846
con men, scumbags, and shitweasels,

25:34.006 --> 25:38.047
but they will never,
ever elect a goober.

25:38.207 --> 25:41.487
But while he talks a good game,
Pai actually opposed

25:41.647 --> 25:43.247
the rules we mentioned earlier

25:43.407 --> 25:45.567
and was happy
when they were overturned.

25:45.727 --> 25:47.047
And since becoming FCC Chair,

25:47.207 --> 25:49.248
he seemed reluctant
to force telecoms to act.

25:49.408 --> 25:51.728
For instance,
he could require them to offer

25:51.888 --> 25:54.688
free call-blocking services
or implement something called

25:54.848 --> 25:58.128
"call authentication," which could
significantly curtail spoofing,

25:58.288 --> 26:01.809
but he hasn't done that.
Instead, he "urged" them to do it.

26:01.969 --> 26:04.209
and while some say that
they are "working on it,"

26:04.369 --> 26:07.729
the fact is, if he had "required" them
to do it from the get-go,

26:07.889 --> 26:09.689
we might have those fixes by now.

26:09.849 --> 26:11.770
Telecom companies
aren't really gonna

26:11.930 --> 26:14.170
listen to you unless
you force them to.

26:14.330 --> 26:18.450
And AT&T isn't gonna listen to you
at all unless you call them on T-Mobile.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.330
Ha! How would they hear you otherwise?

26:20.490 --> 26:23.531
Their call would drop out.
That's right, business daddy.

26:23.691 --> 26:26.211
That's right.
You've inherited a problem child.

26:26.371 --> 26:29.811
Let's dance.
Let's dance, you and I.

26:30.611 --> 26:34.131
But the thing experts are really worried
that Pai might do

26:34.291 --> 26:37.412
is bow to pressure from groups
like telemarketers and banks

26:37.572 --> 26:41.372
and draft a new, narrower definition
of what constitutes "autodialing."

26:41.532 --> 26:45.692
It's technical, but that would basically
limit what would count as a robocall.

26:45.852 --> 26:48.973
And if he does that, it could
have huge consequences.

26:49.133 --> 26:53.093
So, for instance, if Wells Fargo called
your cell phone 6,000 times,

26:53.253 --> 26:56.973
you might no longer be able to sue them
under anti-robocall laws.

26:57.133 --> 26:59.134
And it is safe to assume that
at that point,

26:59.294 --> 27:01.974
robocalls are going to increase
even more.

27:02.134 --> 27:05.734
So if only there was a way to get
the FCC's attention on this issue.

27:05.894 --> 27:08.294
One way to do that
would be if someone had,

27:08.454 --> 27:11.975
I don't know, say the office numbers
of all five FCC Commissioners,

27:12.135 --> 27:15.695
because then you could hypothetically
set up a program to robocall

27:15.855 --> 27:19.015
those numbers every 90 minutes
with a message, say,

27:19.175 --> 27:21.375
I don't know, like this.

27:46.538 --> 27:48.978
That would be really annoying, right?

27:49.138 --> 27:54.298
To get that every 90 minutes,
it would really drive the point home.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.658
And, you know, I guess at this point,

27:56.818 --> 27:59.539
it's probably obvious
what is about to happen here.

28:00.659 --> 28:03.539
Yes, FCC, we meet again,
old friends.

28:03.699 --> 28:05.739
Except this time,
unlike our past encounters,

28:05.899 --> 28:09.659
I don't need to ask hordes of real
people to bombard you with messages,

28:09.819 --> 28:14.020
because with the miracle of robocalling,
I can now do it all by myself.

28:14.180 --> 28:18.540
You see, it turns out
robocalling is so easy,

28:18.700 --> 28:23.021
it only took our tech guy literally
15 minutes to work out how to do it.

28:23.181 --> 28:26.861
So when I press this button, will it
trigger our robocalls to the FCC?

28:27.021 --> 28:28.781
No, no.
That would be too simple.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.661
Instead, behold.

28:32.981 --> 28:35.422
Instead...

28:35.582 --> 28:40.662
When my finger presses this button,
I will trigger this much larger finger

28:40.822 --> 28:43.182
that will press
a much larger button,

28:43.342 --> 28:45.822
which will trigger our calls
to the FCC.

28:45.982 --> 28:48.783
So, FCC, you know what
you need to do.

28:48.943 --> 28:51.183
And by the way,
if you want to tell us that

28:51.343 --> 28:54.303
you don't consent to be robocalled,
that's no problem.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.783
Just write a certified letter
to the address

28:56.943 --> 28:59.904
we've buried somewhere within
the first chapter of "Moby Dick"

29:00.064 --> 29:01.904
currently scrolling up the screen.

29:02.064 --> 29:03.744
You got that, right?
You got it.

29:03.904 --> 29:07.504
Find the address, write to us,
and we'll stop the calls immediately.

29:07.664 --> 29:12.905
And if you're thinking there should be
a simpler way to opt out, well, no shit.

29:13.065 --> 29:16.185
Okay, there's simply no point
delaying this any longer.

29:16.345 --> 29:17.825
Here goes.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.625
Unleash hell.

29:23.466 --> 29:24.986
It's ringing!

29:25.146 --> 29:27.146
I think it's for you.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.386
That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

29:30.546 --> 29:32.946
See you next week.
Good night.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.747
Pick up.
Pick up.
