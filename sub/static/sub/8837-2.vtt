01:25.085 --> 01:27.711
CAN'T TALK TO YOU
THIS MORNING, BUNNY.
I'M LATE FOR SCHOOL.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.671
SEE YOU. LOVE YOU!

01:48.650 --> 01:50.234
SORRY I'M LATE,
MISS BEADLE.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.195
LAURA, YOUR SISTER
WAS HERE ON TIME.
NOW, WHY WEREN'T YOU?

01:53.363 --> 01:54.696
I HAD TO STOP BY
STENSON'S ORCHARD

01:54.864 --> 01:56.740
TO GET AN APPLE
FOR SOMEONE.

01:56.908 --> 02:01.620
WELL, THAT'S
VERY NICE OF YOU,
LAURA. THANK YOU.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.664
IT WASN'T FOR YOU,
MISS BEADLE,

02:03.832 --> 02:05.541
BUT I'LL GET YOU
ONE NEXT TIME.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.126
IT WAS FOR
A HORSE.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.293
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]

02:08.461 --> 02:10.254
Miss Beadle:
ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.547
LAURA, THAT WAS
STILL VERY NICE,

02:11.714 --> 02:12.965
BUT I THINK
IN THE FUTURE

02:13.133 --> 02:14.967
YOU SHOULD GIVE
PRESENTS TO A FRIEND
AFTER SCHOOL.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.510
Laura: YES, MA'AM.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.761
ALL RIGHT, CLASS...

02:17.929 --> 02:19.304
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
10 MINUTES TO REVIEW

02:19.472 --> 02:21.932
THE SPELLING WORDS
ON PAGE 38,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.601
AND THEN WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE AN ORAL QUIZ.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.814
SERVES YOU RIGHT.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.691
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO FEED MY HORSE.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.151
SHE LIKES APPLES.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.986
I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE LIKES.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.113
SHE'S NOT YOUR HORSE
ANYMORE. SHE'S MINE.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.240
AND I TOLD YOU TO
STAY AWAY FROM HER.

02:38.408 --> 02:42.202
YOU ONLY DO IT BECAUSE
YOU WANT HER TO LIKE YOU
MORE THAN SHE LIKES ME.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.955
SO THAT'S WHY YOU GIVE
MISS BEADLE APPLES.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.456
Miss Beadle: LAURA.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.959
I JUST GAVE YOU SOME
WORK TO DO. NOW,
WHY ARE YOU TALKING?

02:49.127 --> 02:52.045
NELLIE WAS JUST
TELLING ME WHY SHE
GIVES YOU APPLES.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.380
I WAS NOT!

02:53.548 --> 02:55.966
YOU HAVE ABOUT
5 MINUTES OF THAT
REVIEW TIME LEFT.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.010
I THINK YOU
SHOULD USE IT.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.056
I HATE YOU.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.142
I HOPE SO.

JASON!

03:15.653 --> 03:17.654
DO YOU WANT TO WATCH
ME RIDE MY HORSE?

03:17.822 --> 03:18.906
I'M WAITING
FOR SOMEONE.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.157
I'LL LET YOU
RIDE HER.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.491
THAT'S REAL
NICE, NELLIE,

03:21.659 --> 03:22.826
BUT LIKE I SAID,
I'M WAITING FOR
SOMEONE.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.161
WHO ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

03:24.329 --> 03:25.495
SOMEBODY.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.872
YOU'RE WAITING
FOR LAURA INGALLS,

WELL, IF YOU MUST
KNOW, YES.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.833
I HATE YOU.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.586

EATING ONIONS?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.588
- HI, JASON.
- HI, LAURA.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.131

03:36.299 --> 03:38.550
I'VE MADE THAT NEW
FLOATER FOR YOU.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.801
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.303

IT'S THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL FLOATER

SO LONG, MARY.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.485
A FLOATER.
HOW ROMANTIC.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.195
CAN WE GO NOW?
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOREVER.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.031
I'M SORRY. I WANTED TO
CLEAN THE BLACKBOARDS
EXTRA GOOD

04:01.199 --> 04:02.824
TO MAKE UP
FOR BEING LATE.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.035
- AND TALKING IN CLASS.
- I WAS NOT TALKING!

04:05.203 --> 04:06.328
YOU WERE, TOO.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.498
WAS NOT.
NELLIE WAS TALKING,
AND I WAS ANSWERING.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.458
NEVER MIND.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.544
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
TRADED MY PONY
TO MR. OLESON.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.922
LAURA INGALLS!
YOU WERE SO PROUD
AT CHRISTMAS

04:17.090 --> 04:18.632
WHEN YOU GAVE MA
THAT STOVE.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.050
I KNOW I WAS.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.886
BUT NELLIE
DOESN'T TREAT BUNNY
THE WAY SHE SHOULD.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.304
SHE DOESN'T
LOVE HER.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.723
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN
DO ABOUT IT NOW.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.183
I SUPPOSE.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.228
ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL MA THAT I GOT
IN TROUBLE TODAY?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.105
NO, I WON'T TELL.

DON'T TOUCH MY HORSE!

04:50.748 --> 04:52.541
I'M NOT HURTING
ANYTHING.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.960
I SAID, STAY AWAY
FROM HER!

04:55.128 --> 04:56.378
DON'T DO THAT!

04:56.546 --> 04:58.839
SHE'S MY HORSE,
AND I'LL DO
AS I PLEASE!

ANYTHING YET, DOC?

NOT YET, NELS.
SHE'S GOT A SLIGHT
CONCUSSION.

WELL, SHE'S TAKEN A PRETTY
NASTY HIT ON THE HEAD.

HER ARM?

ON IT JUST
IN CASE.

WORRY. SHE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

A DANGEROUS ANIMAL!

IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

SAKE, BUT FOR LAURA'S.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.070
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT WOULD DO TO HER.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.364
HANG ON JUST
A MINUTE.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.325
NOW, WE DON'T KNOW
HOW BADLY SHE'S HURT.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.077
I MEAN--

13:49.245 --> 13:53.414
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
TOMORROW SHE COULD BE
OVER IT AND BE JUST FINE.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.750
BE BACK TO THE SAME
OLD NASTY NELLIE.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.919
[LAUGHS]

13:58.087 --> 14:01.005
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.800
SO WE KEEP
THAT THOUGHT, RIGHT?

14:07.304 --> 14:11.140
COME ON TO BED.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.809

14:18.607 --> 14:21.651
I LOVE YOU.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.447
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.386
HELLO,

15:30.554 --> 15:31.638
HOW'S THE
LITTLE GIRL?

15:31.805 --> 15:34.349
SHE'S NO BETTER...
BUT NO WORSE.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.977
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:38.145 --> 15:39.729
I DON'T KNOW.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.648
SHE TOOK A PRETTY GOOD
HIT ON THE HEAD.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.901
SOMETIMES THESE
THINGS ARE TEMPORARY.
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.612
WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.073
I'D BETTER BE OFF
ON MY ROUNDS.
SEE YOU, CHARLES.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.035
SEE YOU, DOC.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.788
HALF PINT,
TIME TO GO IN.

15:56.956 --> 16:01.334
PA, PLEASE...
I CAN'T GO
IN THERE.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.336
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
BUT I WANT YOU TO
COME WITH ME.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.797
NOW, COME ON.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.365

16:32.533 --> 16:35.368
CHARLES. I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU COME IN.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.078
WE JUST SAW
DOC BAKER
OUTSIDE.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.914
YEAH. WELL,
THERE'S NO
CHANGE YET.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.249
HOW'S
NELLIE
FEELING?

16:41.417 --> 16:44.127
WELL, SHE'S
BEING VERY
BRAVE, CHARLES...

16:44.294 --> 16:46.462
TELLING US ALL
NOT TO WORRY.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.673
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AFFECTING
HER APPETITE ANY, EITHER.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.177
SHE HAD A BOX
AND A HALF OF BONBONS
ALREADY THIS MORNING.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.470
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
HOW YOU DOING?

16:54.638 --> 16:56.389
OH, I'LL BE
ALL RIGHT.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.141
IT'S MY WIFE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

16:58.308 --> 17:01.811
REVEREND ALDEN'S COMING BY
THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK TO HER.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.229
MAYBE THAT'LL HELP.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.981
NELS, I KNOW
YOU HAVE ENOUGH
ON YOUR MIND,

17:05.149 --> 17:06.482
BUT I WANTED TO TELL
YOU ABOUT THE HORSE.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.359
OH, I ALREADY
KNOW ABOUT THAT.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.903
DORFLER TOLD ME THAT
HE SAW LAURA RIDE OUT.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.780
I KNOW SHE
HAD NO RIGHT TO
TAKE THE ANIMAL.

17:12.948 --> 17:18.369
SHE HAD EVERY RIGHT.
IT WASN'T THE ANIMAL'S
FAULT. IT WAS JUST--

17:18.537 --> 17:20.663
IT JUST HAPPENED.

17:20.831 --> 17:24.208
I COULDN'T HAVE DESTROYED
THE ANIMAL, ANYWAY.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.128
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF
YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO MY MISSIS ABOUT THAT.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.921
SHE THINKS THE HORSE
JUST RAN OFF,

17:29.089 --> 17:33.885
AND I THINK IT'S BEST
WE JUST KEEP IT THAT WAY
FOR A WHILE.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.636
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YESTERDAY, LAURA.

17:35.804 --> 17:39.515
MY WIFE WAS...
JUST UPSET, THAT'S ALL.

17:39.683 --> 17:44.604
NELLIE WAS
ASKING ABOUT YOU.
WANTED TO SEE YOU.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.232
WELL, MAYBE
I SHOULD WAIT TILL
SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.359
SHE ASKED ABOUT YOU
THIS MORNING.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.986
WHY DON'T YOU
GO ON UP?

17:53.864 --> 17:55.740
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.835
WELL, I BETTER GET
BACK TO THE MILL.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.007
WE'RE PRAYING
FOR HER.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.801
THANK YOU, CHARLES.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.599
WHAT'S IT LIKE
OUTSIDE TODAY?

19:03.767 --> 19:06.060
IS THE SUN SHINING?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.854
IT'S A FINE MORNING.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.438
THAT'S WHAT I MISS
THE MOST...

19:09.606 --> 19:13.943
SEEING THE SUN,
THE BLUE SKY...
HEARING THE BIRDS SING.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.987
BUT I'LL HAVE
TO GET USED TO IT.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.282
OH, NELLIE...
DON'T SAY THAT.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.908
YOU'RE GOING
TO GET BETTER.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.201
YOU HAVE TO.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.829
DON'T CRY, LAURA.
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.998
I FORGIVE YOU.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.875
OH, NELLIE...
I'M SORRY.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.962
I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD
DO TO HELP YOU.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.464
I'D DO ANYTHING...
ANYTHING.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.841
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.719
IT'S ENOUGH JUST KNOWING
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.305
THERE IS...ONE THING
YOU COULD DO.

19:42.472 --> 19:43.973
I HATE TO ASK, BUT--

19:44.141 --> 19:47.768
OH, NO, PLEASE.
ANYTHING.

19:47.936 --> 19:52.023
WELL, I WON'T BE ABLE
TO GO TO SCHOOL ANYMORE--

19:52.191 --> 19:53.941
OH, NELLIE,
DON'T SAY THAT.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.068
YOU'RE GOING TO
GET BETTER SOON.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.278
PERHAPS...

19:57.446 --> 20:00.948
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE.

YOU'D HELP ME.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.504
AND I DON'T WANT
TO FALL BEHIND.

I THOUGHT, IF YOU
WEREN'T TOO BUSY,

20:18.008 --> 20:21.510
YOU COULD BRING
MY ASSIGNMENTS HERE
AND HELP ME KEEP UP.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.012
WOULD YOU DO
THAT, LAURA?

CLOSE MY EYES AND
REST FOR A MOMENT.

DO IT AFTER SCHOOL.

I COULD ASK MARY
TO DO MY CHORES.

YOUR OWN HOMEWORK?

21:24.283 --> 21:27.076

AT THE SAME TIME.

ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
