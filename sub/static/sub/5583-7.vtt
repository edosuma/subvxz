00:03.837 --> 00:05.573
Previously on Empire...
I wrote a song for you.

00:05.606 --> 00:08.376
* Boom, boom, boom, boom,
bang, bang, bang, bang... *

00:08.409 --> 00:10.478
This is how playas
play to win!

00:10.511 --> 00:12.046
That's what I'm
talking about.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.348
You and k.d. lang,
y'all best friends now?

00:14.382 --> 00:16.184
That song that you recorded
with your daddy,

00:16.217 --> 00:17.718
think I could make it
sound better.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.187
ANDRE:
Deputy Mayor Alvarez.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.988
ALVAREZ:
Mr. Lyon, the city would love

00:21.021 --> 00:22.156
to help you.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.857
ANDRE:
I put a gun to my head

00:23.891 --> 00:25.393
and I pulled the trigger.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.594
He's testing you.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.597
There's a purpose
to all of it.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.199
You feelin' me?
No!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.766
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to come on to you.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.868
You forgive me?

00:34.902 --> 00:36.270
MAN: Get your
ass down, man!

00:36.304 --> 00:38.038
Should've taken
the more famous brother.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.608
Now let's talk.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.277
COOKIE: Make me forget
about everything, Laz.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.950
* I'm in my 14 carats

00:49.983 --> 00:53.387
* I'm 14 carat

00:53.421 --> 00:56.524
* Doin' it up like Midas

00:56.557 --> 00:57.958
* Mm

00:57.991 --> 01:00.361
* Now you say I got a touch...

01:00.394 --> 01:01.895
Oh, my God,
I have to go.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.864
I have to go,
I have to go, I have to go.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.033
I have to...
I have to... go.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.536
The last time
I didn't show up to work,

01:08.569 --> 01:11.105
my son turned my office
into a strip club.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.640
(laughs)

01:12.673 --> 01:15.576
Mmm, I'd like to
see you work it,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.044
just for me.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.579
Mmm.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.648
I would love to dance for you.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.150
But I got to go.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.452
Mm-mm. Listen, babe.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.720
You are a legit mogul.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.489
All right?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.991
You don't have to get out
of bed to run your dynasty.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.161
* Let me show you
how proud I am to be yours... *

01:33.194 --> 01:35.596
Yeah, and I'm sure Dr. Dre
kicked off Beats

01:35.629 --> 01:38.566
from the comforts
of his king-sized.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.434
Yeah, if life
could be that easy.

01:40.468 --> 01:44.405
But I'm serious,
all right?

01:44.438 --> 01:47.275
Have somebody
bring your laptop,
(groans)

01:47.308 --> 01:49.577
and I got you on
breakfast in bed.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.612
Eggs...
You cook?

01:51.645 --> 01:53.747
Yeah. Some eggs,
smoked salmon.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.483
Yes.
Mm?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.684
Some bacon?

01:56.717 --> 01:59.587
Yes, we got bacon.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.822
* Good for you, good for you
(laughs)

02:01.855 --> 02:04.525
* Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
(giggles)

02:06.360 --> 02:08.529
*

02:11.365 --> 02:13.334
* Yeah

02:13.367 --> 02:18.206
* Got your uniform

02:18.239 --> 02:19.173
* On already

02:19.207 --> 02:22.210
* On already, on already *

02:22.243 --> 02:24.345
* So go and get you
in the shower, no water *

02:24.378 --> 02:26.280
* Hard to stay dry
with ten thousand *

02:26.314 --> 02:28.516
* All on your body,
it's like power *
(phone vibrating)

02:28.549 --> 02:31.485
* Giving you energy to work

02:31.519 --> 02:33.287
* Work, work... *

02:33.321 --> 02:35.523
COOKIE: Damn, that phone ringing
a little too much

02:35.556 --> 02:37.625
for it to be a side jawn.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
You got a wife you
ain't tell me about?

02:39.693 --> 02:40.894
(chuckles)

02:40.928 --> 02:42.196
No.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.032
It's actually some chick

02:45.065 --> 02:47.335
that I was going at
for a while.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.537
And she was ignoring me.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.205
Mm.
Playing it cool and whatnot.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.976
Couple weeks ago, I'd have
been all over that text, but...

02:56.009 --> 02:57.578
not anymore.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.180
I'm down with that.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.517
Yo, check this out.
What do you think of this?

03:03.551 --> 03:04.752
Hmm?

03:06.454 --> 03:07.921
Oh, it's a pretty good lineup.
Right?

03:07.955 --> 03:08.922
That's yours?

03:08.956 --> 03:09.923
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.159
Yeah. I was thinking,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.828
maybe we add a few
Lyon Dynasty artists to it.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.063
Mm.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.331
Where's your name?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.032
It's the Heat 103
Summer Jam.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.534
I'm just the promoter.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.769
Right.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.837
See, here's the thing.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.607
I'm not "just" anything.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.244
That's what
Lyon Dynasty needs.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.545
Hmm.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.381
I'm-a have my own summer jam.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.183
Your own?
Yep.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.785
It's gonna be like
a old-school cookout

03:37.818 --> 03:40.854
with all of
Lyon Dynasty's artists,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.956
whose names won't be
in some fine print

03:42.990 --> 03:45.058
on the bottom
of some long-ass list.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.194
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh. (chuckles)

03:47.227 --> 03:51.098
And my name will be
in big, giant letters.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.266
(laughs)

03:52.300 --> 03:53.901
"Cookie's Cookout."

03:53.934 --> 03:55.135
(laughs):
I love it.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.804
You see what kind
of magic happens

03:56.837 --> 03:59.206
when you stay in bed
with me for three days? Hmm?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.476
Oh, really? So you just gonna
take all the credit?

04:02.510 --> 04:04.144
No, I'm not gonna
take all the credit.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.413
Mmm.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.080
I'm gonna take
all the Cookie.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.116
(laughs)

04:23.497 --> 04:25.232
* Look, from the bottom
I started *

04:25.265 --> 04:26.667
* So there's nothing
that you could say to me *

04:26.700 --> 04:27.735
* I prodigal where I grew up

04:27.768 --> 04:29.570
* And this the newest slavery

04:29.603 --> 04:31.405
* People see you try hard, like
why you want to play with me? *

04:31.439 --> 04:32.673
* I bring them heaters out,
somebody better pray for me *

04:32.706 --> 04:33.941
* 'Cause all I know
is this money *

04:33.974 --> 04:35.476
* I gotta have it

04:35.509 --> 04:36.677
* These suicidal thoughts
gettin' bad *

04:36.710 --> 04:38.145
* I'm gettin' madder

04:38.178 --> 04:39.813
* Uh, they say
the good die young *

04:39.847 --> 04:41.482
* I put the pedal to the metal,
hit the gas *

04:41.515 --> 04:43.517
* Then I'm gone...
Man, this is wack.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.519
No, no, no,
you were right there!

04:45.553 --> 04:46.787
Damn!
(music stops)

04:46.820 --> 04:48.956
Do it again!

04:48.989 --> 04:50.624
You can't keep running
from this.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.660
I mean, what the hell
your daddy do to you?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.328
What did yours do to you?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.664
(sighs)

04:56.697 --> 04:59.967
Freda...
look, this is your verse.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.201
It's not about me.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.636
And I saw you.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.271
You were face-to-face
with the monster.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.939
You don't run from it,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.376
you embrace
and merge with the pain.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.010
That's how you make
the record soar.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.979
You got to merge
with that pain.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.014
You know Huey Jarvis?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.315
Duh.
Yeah, well,

05:15.349 --> 05:17.050
I'm about to play this for him
later on today.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.151
We might actually do it live

05:18.185 --> 05:19.653
in his little
living room.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.154
Stop playin', Lucious.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.123
Little boys play, not me.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.392
Do it again.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.699
*

05:31.732 --> 05:33.901
* Look, from the bottom
I started *

05:33.934 --> 05:35.836
* So there's nothing
that you could say to me *

05:35.869 --> 05:38.171
* I prodigal where I grew up
and this the newest slavery *

05:38.205 --> 05:40.508
* People see you try hard, like
why you want to play with me? *

05:40.541 --> 05:43.243
* I bring them heaters out,
somebody better pray for me *

05:43.276 --> 05:45.178
* 'Cause all I know is
this money, I gotta have it *

05:45.212 --> 05:46.580
* These suicidal thoughts
gettin' bad *

05:46.614 --> 05:48.048
* I'm gettin' madder

05:48.081 --> 05:50.017
* Uh, they say
the good die young *

05:50.050 --> 05:52.586
* I put the pedal to the metal,
hit the gas, then I'm gone *

05:52.620 --> 05:54.187
* Now I'm front line
at the court *

05:54.221 --> 05:55.756
* And I'm 'bout to take a shot

05:55.789 --> 05:57.391
* I pull it up, cock it back,
let it fly *

05:57.425 --> 05:59.092
* Now I'm watching
for the backboard *

05:59.126 --> 06:01.328
* And when they say the world
is yours, I just let 'em know *

06:01.361 --> 06:02.996
* That I'm just
tryin' to score, oh! *

06:03.030 --> 06:04.231
* Boom, boom, boom, boom... *
Yes!

06:04.264 --> 06:06.333
That's what I'm talking about!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.101
Stick it, stick it!
Get 'em!

06:08.135 --> 06:09.537
Let's double that up.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.772
Do that
one more time.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.807
*

06:17.811 --> 06:22.049
* They say heavy is the head
that wears a crown *

06:22.082 --> 06:25.786
* They say heavy is
the head that wears a crown... *

06:25.819 --> 06:26.820
(music stops)

06:29.457 --> 06:31.459
(phone vibrating)

06:31.492 --> 06:32.493
(sighs)

06:39.600 --> 06:40.734
(door opens)

06:40.768 --> 06:42.269
(chuckles)

06:42.302 --> 06:44.738
You got a husband you
didn't tell me about?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.640
No, I'm just kidding.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.108
It's none of
my business.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.810
No.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.078
It's Jamal.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.913
He wants my feedback
on a song.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.115
What, and your
ex would have

06:55.148 --> 06:56.717
a problem with that
or something?

06:56.750 --> 07:00.320
A problem with my ex,
a problem with my other son,

07:00.353 --> 07:03.290
a problem because we're
supposed to be in competition.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.761
He's your son, Cookie.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.429
That trumps everything.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.966
You should text him back.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.404
I'm gonna get dressed
and go get a paper.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.672
Okay.

07:28.516 --> 07:33.286
* They say heavy is the head
that wears a crown *

07:33.320 --> 07:37.457
* They say heavy is
the head that wears a crown... *

07:40.961 --> 07:43.997
*

07:44.031 --> 07:47.668
* They say heavy is the head
that wears a crown *

07:47.701 --> 07:49.269
* Always used to think

07:49.302 --> 07:51.805
* That that was just
a damn excuse... *

07:51.839 --> 07:53.774
That's real close, baby.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.176
* 'Cause they couldn't
hold it down... *

07:56.209 --> 07:57.477
You almost there.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.449
Hey, baby boy.
(music stops)

08:02.482 --> 08:03.684
You got something for me?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.452
Yeah, I'm almost done.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.387
No, we got three weeks
to drop this track

08:07.420 --> 08:08.656
if it's gonna be eligible.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.524
Dad, chill out, all right?

08:10.558 --> 08:11.792
It's almost done.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.194
All right, it's in your hands.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.410
The hell you been, bro?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.512
Don't worry about
where I've been.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.348
Is that bitch upstairs?

08:35.382 --> 08:38.085
That means
her little man-baby's

08:38.118 --> 08:40.688
running around somewhere without
his mommy holding him down.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.056
Fall back off the kid,
all right? I'm handling this.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.558
You need to be handling
business, not booty.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.326
We need to get paid.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.862
We're gonna get paid ten times
more than what we asked.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
All right?
Cookie's rolling out a big show.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.366
She's gonna need to come to me
to secure the venue,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.036
up the ticket sales, vendor
deposits, all that, right?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.705
We're gonna get paid
on that first,

08:57.738 --> 09:00.307
and then we're gonna hit her
for the protection, too.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.479
Fall back.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.550
You hear me?

09:12.986 --> 09:15.022
Hey. Stop.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.690
Where you going without me?
What's up?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.592
I'm hungry,
that's what's up.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.794
(chuckles)
We ate everything.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.095
You ate everything.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.697
Yeah.
(giggles)

09:23.731 --> 09:24.932
Where's your paper?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.466
Corner guy ran out.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.201
So I'll get one at the diner
on 1st and A.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.202
Okay.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.238
Come on.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.073
Got to feed you.
Yeah, that's right.
Yes.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.942
'Cause I know how you get
when you're hungry.
(laughs)

09:43.984 --> 09:45.218
Wow.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.055
Sir Huey...
you got enough gold here

09:48.088 --> 09:49.890
to rival
the pharaohs.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.659
That's not
the be-all and end-all.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.761
You're rich
in other ways.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.062
Thank you.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.831
That's easy for you to say.
You done won every award.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.067
You've had a truckload
of nominations, man,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.468
but you never took one home,

10:01.501 --> 10:03.103
did you?

10:03.136 --> 10:05.505
Is this gonna
be your year?

10:05.538 --> 10:07.107
You tell me.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.777
Maybe an invitation to one of
your Living Room sessions

10:09.810 --> 10:12.012
might help my odds.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.613
That's an old
wives' tale.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.582
Really?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.317
That's why everybody that's
played one of your sessions

10:17.350 --> 10:18.986
in the last five years

10:19.019 --> 10:21.621
have walked onstage
and accepted their award.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.590
Yeah.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.358
Let's see what you got.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.361
Well, being in jail
put a fire in me.

10:28.395 --> 10:31.598
Took me back
to where I came from.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.300
It's still a work in progress.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.469
LUCIOUS: * From the bottom I got
up to the top of the pros *

10:36.503 --> 10:39.039
* From the gutter to the shutter
trimmed out in gold *

10:39.072 --> 10:41.474
* Life bless my soul,
God bless my mo *

10:41.508 --> 10:44.878
* Nothin' less than the best
so the rest is old *

10:44.912 --> 10:47.114
* It ain't about the pain

10:47.147 --> 10:49.182
* Tell 'em what's my name

10:49.216 --> 10:52.385
* Boom, boom, boom, boom,
bang, bang, bang, bang *

10:52.419 --> 10:54.187
FREDA: * Look,
from the bottom I started *

10:54.221 --> 10:56.056
* So there's nothing
that you could say to me *

10:56.089 --> 10:58.558
* I prodigal where I grew up
and this the newest slavery *

10:58.591 --> 11:00.327
* People see you try hard...

11:00.360 --> 11:01.494
Who's the girl?

11:01.528 --> 11:03.630
Freda Gatz.
One of my new discoveries.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.866
* 'Cause all I know is
this money, I gotta have it... *

11:05.899 --> 11:08.702
Lucious... you're
onto something.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.504
So it's not there yet.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.875
I'm still wanting to hear more--
feel more--

11:14.908 --> 11:16.309
about that part of you

11:16.343 --> 11:17.911
that you keep
locked up so tight.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.914
You got to dig deeper.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.918
(thunder rumbling)

11:30.123 --> 11:32.459
*

11:44.637 --> 11:46.539
Hey, yo.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.441
Make some noise.
Welcome to Lyon Dynasty, y'all.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.542
(crowd cheering)

11:49.576 --> 11:51.779
COOKIE: Welcome,
hip-hop bloggers!

11:51.812 --> 11:56.116
Okay, so today we are
announcing the birth

11:56.149 --> 11:58.285
of a new event that's
about to blow up

11:58.318 --> 12:00.553
into one of hip-hop's
biggest jams.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.957
And to give y'all a little
tasty taste, something small...

12:03.991 --> 12:05.692
A little taste.
(laughs)

12:05.725 --> 12:07.861
...make some noise
for Mirage á Trois.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.696
Yes! Give it up for
the sexy ladies!

12:09.729 --> 12:10.697
(crowd cheering)

12:10.730 --> 12:13.433
*

12:13.466 --> 12:16.103
* We're sipping
bottomless mimosa *

12:16.136 --> 12:17.537
* Pour me another dosa

12:17.570 --> 12:19.706
* It's 10:00 a.m., we partying

12:19.739 --> 12:21.608
* Still going, getting loco

12:21.641 --> 12:23.310
* That bottomless mimosa

12:23.343 --> 12:24.644
* My champagne supernova

12:24.677 --> 12:26.113
* It's 10:00 a.m., we partying

12:26.146 --> 12:28.315
* Come on,
let's have a toast to *

12:28.348 --> 12:32.152
* All them girls
in they yoga pants *

12:32.185 --> 12:35.155
* When I ain't even
been to bed *

12:35.188 --> 12:39.292
* Let me go get you
another glass *

12:39.326 --> 12:42.495
* Bottoms up, bottoms up,
go on, get your bottoms up *

12:42.529 --> 12:45.999
* Welcome to breakfast,
you can call me Tiffany... *

12:46.033 --> 12:47.267
Did you see that?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.969
Carmen just ass-bumped Laura
out her spot.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.270
Yeah, because
it's Carmen's spot.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.272
You need to bump her up
to lead singer.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.740
Carmen ain't got the pipes, Ma.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.008
And Laura doesn't have
the personality.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.477
She ain't a star, Hakeem.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.579
* Feel like we're on a yacht

12:59.612 --> 13:01.248
* Sailing south of France

13:01.281 --> 13:02.515
* Maybe I drank too much...

13:02.549 --> 13:03.783
Make the switch.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.018
* Oh, I can't find my friends

13:05.052 --> 13:06.319
* But you look good enough

13:06.353 --> 13:07.654
* Let's drink

13:07.687 --> 13:08.788
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

13:08.822 --> 13:11.458
* Go on, get your bottoms up.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.598
I love your
music, Lucious.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.368
I really do, more
than life itself.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.535
But these numbers...

13:22.569 --> 13:24.437
The numbers don't tell
the whole story, Mimi.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.039
Don't sugarcoat, Andre.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.040
Let Mimi do

13:27.074 --> 13:28.708
her song and dance,
and then

13:28.741 --> 13:29.709
tell her what you got planned.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.880
Well, stock
prices are 12%

13:32.913 --> 13:35.382
below our projections
for the quarter.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.549
Wall Street's skittish,

13:36.583 --> 13:39.953
and our shareholders
are pissed.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.454
Over to you.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.056
Sing and dance, Andre.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.626
Apart from the fact
that Empire's share price

13:46.659 --> 13:48.228
has actually risen 12%

13:48.261 --> 13:49.997
since my father's return,

13:50.030 --> 13:53.000
this company's about to make its
biggest move since going public:

13:53.033 --> 13:54.501
music streaming.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
With market leaders
in our sites,

13:56.269 --> 13:58.005
this move will make Empire
the dominant player

13:58.038 --> 14:00.673
in the music industry, period.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.910
Uh-huh. I like it so far.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.411
I have a team
working in-house to develop

14:04.444 --> 14:05.578
our own unique platform.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.980
We'll be ready for beta testing

14:07.014 --> 14:08.415
in four to six months.
That's too long.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.816
And that's
a conservative estimate.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.751
Why build when
you can buy?

14:11.784 --> 14:15.755
Swiftstream-- it's number two
in the streaming marketplace.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.425
It's ripe and ready
for a merger.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.659
A merger?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.760
Mm-hmm.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.029
Pop, a merger means, what,

14:22.062 --> 14:23.330
new board,
new corporate structure,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.532
redundancies that lead
to layoffs.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.967
Pop, it's reckless.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.939
Hmm.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.774
Set up a meeting
with Swiftstream.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.777
I'd love to play some new music
for you in my office, Mimi.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.779
Yes.

14:39.812 --> 14:40.480
Meeting's adjourned.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.452
Pop, uh...

14:45.485 --> 14:47.054
I need to do some
due diligence with Swiftstream

14:47.087 --> 14:48.121
before I set up a meeting.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.957
My people already did.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.392
A year ago, Jago Locke-- he's
the founder of Swiftstream--

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
he was being touted as
the next Zuckerberg.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.628
But he got his
ass handed to him

14:55.662 --> 14:57.464
because the other services
beat him to the punch.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.133
He is a bit cagey, but
he's ready for a partner.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.468
Obviously,

15:01.501 --> 15:03.136
Mimi's got this
one under control.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.305
Why don't you go see
your lady friend

15:05.338 --> 15:06.906
down in the
mayor's office.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.477
Freda Gatz has a small legal
issue we need to take care of.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.644
What kind of legal issue?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.813
Gang injunction.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.050
That's not a small issue, Pop.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.219
And you're not a small man, son.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.088
I'm sure that's why
the deputy mayor

15:21.121 --> 15:23.090
likes doing business with you.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.857
After you.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.906
Look, I need you
to teach her the basics:

15:39.939 --> 15:41.841
makeup, hair,

15:41.874 --> 15:43.176
how to walk, how to dress.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.712
Okay, I'm sure
I could dress better, but...

15:47.814 --> 15:50.117
Um, Laura, can you get me
a green tea

15:50.150 --> 15:52.185
from the fridge, please?

15:52.219 --> 15:54.454
Yeah, sure.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.124
Okay, stop.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.026
Think long legs.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.760
Lead with your hips.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.096
Imagine you're knocking down
everything in your path

16:03.130 --> 16:04.731
and nothing can stop you.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.535
Every move you make,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.203
pretend somebody is
watching you,

16:10.237 --> 16:11.938
trying to take your picture
or something.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.540
That sounds awful.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.208
Well, you better get used to it,
sweetie, 'cause eventually

16:15.242 --> 16:16.409
you'll even want it to be true.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.452
You all cute and stuff.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.886
Thank you.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.457
So... how do I look
from the back?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.226
The same as from the front,
except badonk! (laughs)

16:34.327 --> 16:35.895
I mean, what you
all nervous for?

16:35.928 --> 16:37.564
It ain't like Laz ain't
seen it all before.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.899
I'm not going to see Laz.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.335
Word up, Cook!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.637
Well, in that case, put another
notch of that lipstick on.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.173
Age ain't nothing
but a number, girl!

16:46.206 --> 16:47.507
(laughs)
You crazy.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.509
Yes, my boss is a pimp!

16:56.015 --> 16:56.983
Hi, baby.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.319
Hey, Ma.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.653
(laughs)

17:00.687 --> 17:02.021
Look at you.
Look at you.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.090
Outfit on fleek.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.192
Please. This old thing?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.929
I, um...

17:09.962 --> 17:12.099
I didn't think
you would show up.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.502
I probably shouldn't have,
but...

17:15.535 --> 17:17.704
I have some very exciting news
to tell you.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.339
Do tell.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.275
All right, so you know,
um, Jamieson Hinthrop.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.443
He's kind of been
mentoring me.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.544
Yeah, I heard.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.546
Well, he called
Huey Jarvis,

17:26.579 --> 17:29.616
and Huey invited me to
perform "Heavy" on his next

17:29.649 --> 17:30.683
Living Room session.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.918
(gasps) Oh, my...
(laughs)

17:31.951 --> 17:33.886
Jamal, that is huge!
Hey, waiter!

17:33.920 --> 17:36.956
Get me a bottle of your most
expensive champagne, honey.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.024
We got to celebrate!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.459
I'm so proud of you, Jamal!

17:39.492 --> 17:40.860
Ma, you know
that's all you, though.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.061
You completely flipped that song

17:42.095 --> 17:43.430
and made it
ten times better.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.864
You know what,
on second thought,

17:44.897 --> 17:46.399
make it two bottles, honey.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.434
I'm the bomb. (laughs)

17:47.467 --> 17:49.569
You the bomb. You a'ight.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.970
(laughs)

17:51.003 --> 17:52.205
I missed you.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.940
I miss you, too.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.450
PRYCE:
Andre.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.917
What are we doing here?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.953
A reminder.

18:09.789 --> 18:13.059
I wanted to kill myself.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.628
Tried to do it right here,

18:15.662 --> 18:19.466
in this very spot,
to punish my father.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.434
And now he's trying
to bring you back

18:21.468 --> 18:24.504
to that same dark place
where you were at,

18:24.537 --> 18:27.073
when you nearly committed
that terrible sin.

18:27.106 --> 18:31.077
That's why he wants me to see
the deputy mayor.

18:31.110 --> 18:36.015
He wants to see me
fall back on my old ways.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.517
Break my bond with God.

18:37.550 --> 18:41.488
Would fulfilling
your father's venal task

18:41.521 --> 18:44.023
advance your larger task
within Empire?

18:46.058 --> 18:49.629
I'm working real hard, Reverend.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.964
I feel like I-I've finally found

18:51.998 --> 18:53.966
the balance between
my medication and my faith.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.502
But if I stop either one,
Reverend,

18:55.535 --> 18:56.803
I don't know what I'll do.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.807
Andre, God has chosen you.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.175
To be his warrior.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.277
Sometimes,
warriors have to do

19:04.311 --> 19:08.481
things on the battlefield
that would be...

19:08.515 --> 19:11.050
repugnant in any other context.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.886
What are you saying?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.488
That I should sleep with her?

19:15.522 --> 19:18.825
Sin of the flesh... no.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.127
That's sacrosanct
and only for your wife.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.533
But there are many other ways
to accomplish what you need.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.035
*

19:29.068 --> 19:31.037
JAMAL (over earphones):
* They say heavy is the head

19:31.070 --> 19:32.639
* That wears a crown

19:32.672 --> 19:33.740
* Wears a crown *

19:33.773 --> 19:35.508
* They say heavy is the head

19:35.542 --> 19:36.843
* That wears a crown

19:36.876 --> 19:37.910
* Ay...

19:37.944 --> 19:39.479
That's where
you should drop the bass.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.747
Right there.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.749
(slurring):
Hell yeah.
Mm-hmm.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.884
And I'll drop it right
before I come back in.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.919
Mm.
Cookie!

19:46.953 --> 19:48.855
(laughs)

19:50.557 --> 19:53.526
You know, um...

19:53.560 --> 19:56.596
Lyon Dynasty's right around
the corner if you want to

19:56.629 --> 19:57.597
lay something down.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.198
Dad would be so pissed.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.270
I don't even care.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.271
Let's go.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.705
Check, please!

20:05.738 --> 20:07.540
(Jamal laughs)

20:07.574 --> 20:10.243
Welcome to the Lyon
Dynasty, honey.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.444
Okay.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.713
Yes.
I ain't mad at
you for this.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.715
Wait, wait!
Come on!

20:17.717 --> 20:20.253
It should be
* They say heav...

20:20.287 --> 20:21.954
Wait, wait, wait, let me
turn this thing on! Hold on.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.257
*

20:30.963 --> 20:32.399
* It's like
this whole damn kingdom *

20:32.432 --> 20:34.567
* Sitting on top of me now...

20:34.601 --> 20:36.369
It's almost there, baby.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.038
You know what, do that drop one
more time, just one more time.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.941
* Feels like
this whole damn kingdom *

20:41.974 --> 20:44.210
* Sitting on top
of me now *

20:44.243 --> 20:45.912
* Sitting on top of...

20:47.947 --> 20:50.082
Hey! Baby! Hi!

20:50.116 --> 20:52.118
Hey, what you doing here
so early?

20:52.151 --> 20:54.287
I'm rehearsing with Laura.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.589
Wh-What are you doing, looking
all walk-of-shame and whatnot?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.057
Ain't none of
your business, boy.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.392
I-I was working.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.260
Speaking of working,

21:01.294 --> 21:03.396
did you promote Carmen
like I told you to?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.731
HAKEEM: Mom, I have
it all under control.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.899
Okay.
I'll show you when we're done.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.800
All right.
Okay?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.235
Okay. Well, listen here.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.903
Them Three Amigas
better have it together.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.605
If not, I'm gonna kick your ass.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.407
I mean it!

21:14.441 --> 21:15.442
Somebody in here?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.243
No.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.244
* Hey

21:18.277 --> 21:19.412
* Red and black J's

21:19.446 --> 21:20.813
* Looking like a ballplayer...

21:20.847 --> 21:22.949
He's going to want to
get you in the ring.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.117
Hesitate like you're
afraid you might hurt him,

21:25.151 --> 21:28.154
then get in there
and let him beat you.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.256
* I'm the mayor of it

21:30.289 --> 21:32.291
* A young getter gettin',
givin' 'em the flavor lovin' *

21:32.325 --> 21:34.260
* Every little bit
of that dope, boy... *

21:34.293 --> 21:35.928
Jago.

21:35.962 --> 21:36.996
It's Mimi.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.665
I brought Mr. Lyon.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.800
I'm not selling
if that's why you're here.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.869
Well, I'm not buying,
I'm looking for a partner.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.772
You box?

21:45.805 --> 21:48.007
Look, I know I got
a couple years on you, son,

21:48.040 --> 21:50.109
but trust me,
you don't want me in the ring.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.445
They say sparring partners
make the best business partners.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.446
Come on,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.114
strap up.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.283
Strap up.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.851
That's a nice jacket.
Mm-hmm.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.788
(laughs)

22:01.821 --> 22:03.456
Go easy on him.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.791
That's a deal.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.659
All right.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.799
Was that too hard?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.200
I'm fine.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.868
What you should be worried about

22:15.902 --> 22:18.971
is how Beatflow's been
kicking your ass!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.973
Our platform speed
is twice as fast.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.142
They just got
a better marketing campaign.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.344
Imagine what you could do
with Empire in your corner.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.814
Talking about
a true heavyweight.

22:27.847 --> 22:31.183
Now, would I get
the Lucious Lyon catalog?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.184
Exclusively.

22:32.218 --> 22:35.321
(both laugh)

22:35.354 --> 22:36.823
Good. Good.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.324
Those kids, they go
crazy for your music.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.358
(grunting)

22:39.392 --> 22:41.661
Me? I like your beats,

22:41.694 --> 22:43.896
I just find your lyrics
kind of shallow.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.932
(thunder rumbling)

22:48.701 --> 22:50.202
(grunts)

22:51.270 --> 22:54.874
Shallow that, punk ass.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.882
You'll pay for that.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.887
ALVAREZ:
Lifting a gang injunction.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.056
That's no small feat, Mr. Lyon.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.591
I know.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.593
But you'd be serving justice
in this case.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.194
Strictly justice.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.196
I know what
I'd rather serve.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.866
Raquel...

23:19.899 --> 23:23.102
(giggles)

23:23.135 --> 23:25.037
Please don't. Raquel.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.439
Oh, I love that
game, Andre,

23:26.473 --> 23:28.274
but I don't have
a lot of time.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.545
Stop.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.413
Stop.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.615
You're married.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.949
So are you.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.250
Since when has that
been a problem?

23:38.284 --> 23:40.720
Raquel, will you fix
this injunction for me or not?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.088
Why should I?

23:45.324 --> 23:46.626
My wife

23:46.659 --> 23:50.229
and I, we, uh...
(chuckles)

23:50.262 --> 23:52.799
We have enjoyed watching
some of our, uh, closed-door

23:52.832 --> 23:54.133
bartering sessions.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.402
ALVAREZ (over video): Yeah...
That's a good angle.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.471
Bill de Blasio would
like that, wouldn't he?

23:58.505 --> 24:00.072
What the hell?

24:00.106 --> 24:01.608
Hell, indeed.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.743
Unless you want the mayor
to get a full report

24:03.776 --> 24:05.778
on how you conduct
your government business,

24:05.812 --> 24:07.146
have that gang injunction

24:07.179 --> 24:10.483
lifted by tomorrow.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.921
(sighs)

24:14.954 --> 24:16.789
*

24:16.823 --> 24:18.290
* I'm the real deal...

24:18.324 --> 24:20.426
(panting):
Oh, hey.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.629
What are you doing home?

24:24.296 --> 24:27.099
My father sent me to see
Deputy Mayor Alvarez today.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.635
Oh.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.603
(music stops)

24:30.637 --> 24:32.138
And?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.773
And I prayed.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.308
I prayed for
the strength

24:36.342 --> 24:38.845
to resist going back
to my old ways.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.147
And here I am.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.348
Yeah.

24:42.381 --> 24:44.817
(moans)

24:49.221 --> 24:51.290
(chuckles)

24:51.323 --> 24:52.458
Okay?
Oh, yeah.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.626
Did I hurt you?

24:53.660 --> 24:54.861
No.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.462
No?
Mm-mm.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.365
No, baby, this is
what I've been praying for.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.400
(moans)

25:02.735 --> 25:04.303
*

25:04.336 --> 25:06.505
Now the hip.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.140
Can I get some more looks?
Come on, now.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.475
Why, of course.
Over the shoulder.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.010
Remember what
Tiana showed you.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.478
Come on, keep going.
(giggles)

25:12.511 --> 25:13.813
Don't stop.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.648
You was doing good.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.083
Come on, baby,
give it to me.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.218
* Make 'em all stop
when I come up in the spot... *

25:19.251 --> 25:20.419
Why you stop?

25:20.452 --> 25:22.689
* I'm the fire
you cannot extinguish *

25:22.722 --> 25:24.490
* Like a genius,
yeah, that got a ring to it *

25:24.523 --> 25:25.992
* They copying
'cause they seeing me do it... *

25:26.025 --> 25:27.727
(music stops)

25:27.760 --> 25:30.329
She was doing just fine
until you lurked in.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.898
You are wasting your time.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.200
But, see, you can't see that

25:34.233 --> 25:36.402
because you're blinded
by the ass.

25:36.435 --> 25:37.904
I ain't even
touched the girl.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.906
(chuckles)

25:39.939 --> 25:41.540
She must really
got you sprung then.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.210
She ain't
got it, Keem.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.949
Come on, we got to
get you on point.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.154
(playing
"Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom")

26:03.095 --> 26:06.065
I can't find them.
Can't find them.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.735
I can't find them.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.936
(grunts)

26:09.969 --> 26:12.204
I can't...
I can't find them.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.873
I can't find them.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.476
Dwight, do you know what
Mommy did with her bullets?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.115
(sighs)

26:24.150 --> 26:25.618
(chuckles)

26:25.652 --> 26:27.386
Where you been, man?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.889
I'm dying trying
to find one sound.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.257
Let's hear it.
Oh, hell no.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.125
Ain't nobody hearing
this yet. (chuckles)

26:33.159 --> 26:34.627
I understand, so...

26:34.661 --> 26:36.262
just let me know
when you're ready.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.596
(chuckles)
What's up?

26:37.630 --> 26:39.465
I got some great news.

26:39.498 --> 26:42.434
I'm playing Huey Jarvis's Living
Room session this weekend.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.403
Hell nah.
Yup.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.972
When did this happen?

26:46.005 --> 26:46.939
Just last night.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.808
Wow.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.910
That's the best news
I've heard all day, man.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.444
Right? Thanks, Dad.

26:52.478 --> 26:53.479
(both laugh)

26:58.851 --> 27:00.086
Come on, son.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.121
No, no, it's your world, man.
Your world.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.756
It's our world. Come on.
Yours.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.791
(laughs)

27:14.500 --> 27:16.002
(sighs)

27:23.409 --> 27:25.712
* I don't go out much
unless you come through *

27:25.745 --> 27:26.879
* Oh, I

27:26.913 --> 27:30.116
* I'm a tomboy,
put on a dress... *

27:30.149 --> 27:31.650
What about Fort Greene?

27:31.684 --> 27:33.219
No, it's too bougie.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.822
Hmm. Huh?

27:35.855 --> 27:39.391
Yeah, Cookie's Cookout
has got to stay hood.

27:39.425 --> 27:42.461
Well, we could
try for Central Park,

27:42.494 --> 27:44.396
but it's usually booked.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.832
Already did Central Park.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.633
Remember, Free Lucious?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.836
Mm.

27:49.869 --> 27:50.837
(whispers):
What you want?

27:50.870 --> 27:52.739
(chuckles)

27:52.772 --> 27:56.575
I'm thinking of somewhere
uptown, old school.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.577
You know, like in Harlem.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.679
Mm.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.248
Yeah.
Yeah?

28:02.281 --> 28:04.516
Ooh, I know
the perfect place.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.918
What?

28:05.952 --> 28:09.421
A spot called Rock Steady Park.
It's on the Upper West Side.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.858
Yeah.
(chuckles)

28:11.891 --> 28:13.926
Used to call it "The Goat."

28:13.960 --> 28:16.262
Really?
Yeah.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.330
Basketball courts there.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.698
Show me.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.841
Ooh, I like that.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.610
It's on my list as available.
But...

28:31.643 --> 28:33.612
But what?

28:33.645 --> 28:35.114
That's in
Big Heavy's territory.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.883
You're gonna have
to sit down with him.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.084
Uh, no!

28:38.117 --> 28:39.418
I'm not doing
business with him,

28:39.451 --> 28:41.453
not after what he did
to my son. No.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.123
There's got to be somebody
else-- it's New York.

28:44.156 --> 28:48.560
Look, not if you want
Rock Steady Park.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.964
Now, all I said was
you got to sit down with him.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.465
Let him think he won.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.803
He'll let his guard down, now,

28:56.836 --> 28:59.138
and you'll get
your revenge later.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.807
* You got mines,
but I gotta get yours... *

29:00.840 --> 29:02.141
Hmm?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.310
* Got my heart
and I'm coming for ya... *

29:04.343 --> 29:06.645
Okay.
Yeah.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.315
* Got me trapped, I'm in
handcuffs for your love. *

29:09.348 --> 29:10.883
This is the last
thing you got to do.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.084
Look, I know
you can do it.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.154
You're gonna make people
stop and listen to you.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.890
Uh-uh. This is crazy.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.591
Look, everybody who
made it to the next level

29:19.625 --> 29:20.993
had to do something
a little crazy.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.862
That's what being a
superstar is all about.

29:36.142 --> 29:40.612
(softly): * Voz puede volar,
puede atravezar... *

29:43.482 --> 29:45.051
Make them stop.

29:47.719 --> 29:52.691
* Mi voz puede volar,
puede atravezar *

29:52.724 --> 29:58.530
* Cualquier herida, cualquier
tiempo cualquier soledad *

29:58.564 --> 30:02.034
* Sin que la pueda controlar

30:02.068 --> 30:05.204
* Toma forma de canción

30:05.237 --> 30:08.307
* Así es mi voz que sale

30:08.340 --> 30:11.377
* De mi corazón...

30:11.410 --> 30:12.544
(up-tempo music playing)

30:12.578 --> 30:16.548
* Y volará, sin yo querer

30:16.582 --> 30:20.286
* Por los caminos más lejanos
por los sueños que soñé *

30:20.319 --> 30:24.823
* Será reflejo del amor
de lo que me tocó vivir *

30:24.857 --> 30:28.160
* Será la música de fondo
de lo mucho que sentí *

30:28.194 --> 30:29.962
* Oye mi son

30:29.996 --> 30:32.398
* Mi viejo son

30:32.431 --> 30:34.400
* Tiene la clave

30:34.433 --> 30:36.468
* De cualquier generación

30:36.502 --> 30:38.737
* En el alma de mi gente

30:38.770 --> 30:40.572
* En el cuero del tambor

30:40.606 --> 30:44.010
* En las manos del congero,
en los piés del bailador *

30:44.043 --> 30:45.344
* Yo viviré

30:45.377 --> 30:48.080
* Ahí estaré

30:48.114 --> 30:51.750
* Mientras pase una cumparsa
con mi rumba cantaré *

30:51.783 --> 30:53.685
* Seré siempre lo que fuí

30:53.719 --> 30:55.754
* Con mi azúcar para tí

30:55.787 --> 30:59.525
* Yo viviré, yo viviré

30:59.558 --> 31:01.760
* Hey, hey.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.030
(crowd cheering)

31:04.063 --> 31:05.965
(speaks indistinctly)

31:13.472 --> 31:16.775
(cheering continues)

31:16.808 --> 31:19.611
Jago, my love,
got to hear us out.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.180
Nurse!
LUCIOUS:
Now, wait a minute.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.348
Now, I told you I didn't
want to get in the ring

31:22.381 --> 31:23.349
with you in the first place,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.717
and now you got
a morphine drip.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.453
Now, what you said to me
about my music today,

31:27.486 --> 31:28.554
that pissed me the hell off.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.289
But only because
it was true.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.124
You made me dig deeper.

31:32.158 --> 31:35.127
And as a result of you,
I wrote a beautiful song.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.695
Mm-hmm.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.831
Good. I look forward
to my royalty checks.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.871
LUCIOUS:
We're in this together.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.206
You need this deal
as badly as I do.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.475
And you and me,
we're gonna make great partners.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.810
I mean, great partners.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.579
The greatest of all time.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.613
You and me, partners?

31:55.847 --> 32:00.052
Empire, Swiftstream,
merged.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.487
We will dominate the industry.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.990
(slurring):
Dominate.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.324
(chuckles)

32:05.357 --> 32:07.226
Now, with
your permission,

32:07.259 --> 32:08.727
Mimi's going to call
your attorney,

32:08.760 --> 32:12.431
and you're gonna tell him
to draft an agreement

32:12.464 --> 32:15.834
for a merger between
Swiftstream and Empire.

32:15.867 --> 32:16.935
Yeah.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.337
(line ringing)

32:18.370 --> 32:19.605
Hey, Max.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.906
Max, I need you

32:20.939 --> 32:21.940
to draw up a...

32:21.974 --> 32:23.175
(whispers):
Contract.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.676
Contract.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.079
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

32:27.113 --> 32:28.747
* Bang, bang, bang, bang.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.318
So, you run
Rock Steady Park, too, huh?

32:32.351 --> 32:33.585
Yeah, figures.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.521
You gonna get my money
one way or the other, huh?

32:35.554 --> 32:36.688
(Big Heavy laughs)

32:36.722 --> 32:38.357
I don't want
nothing from you, bitch.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.859
You're the one
wants something from me.

32:40.892 --> 32:41.927
Yo, you better relax.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.129
I told you
on the phone,

32:43.162 --> 32:44.363
the only reason
we're here in peace

32:44.396 --> 32:45.431
is to make a deal.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.199
I'll pay for your protection.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.035
But I'm only gonna
give you a small

32:49.068 --> 32:50.769
percentage of
my vendors costs.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.771
Say, what?

32:52.804 --> 32:55.041
LAZ:
Hey, yo, easy. Easy!

32:55.074 --> 32:57.476
You need to get your boys.
Yo, ease up.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.212
COOKIE:
Hakeem, come here.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.147
Let me tell you
what's going on.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.881
You ain't explaining anything,

33:02.914 --> 33:04.883
'cause you ain't giving it
to this bald-headed ass.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.152
I'm an equal partner
in Lyon Dynasty.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.187
Anything needs
to be negotiated...

33:08.220 --> 33:10.856
I'm the one to negotiate it.

33:10.889 --> 33:13.059
And you're in
my negotiating chair.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.660
(chuckles)

33:14.693 --> 33:16.328
It's okay.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.863
Okay.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.005
So... what percentage
we talking about?

33:27.039 --> 33:30.008
As I see it, we only need
to start with the perimeter.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.411
Bump that.
We do all or nothing.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.513
LAZ: No, the kid's right.
City ordinance states

33:34.546 --> 33:37.015
we must have bonded security
on the inside.

33:37.049 --> 33:38.350
What he said.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.985
He's right.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.020
(sighs)

33:44.290 --> 33:46.325
A'ight.

33:46.358 --> 33:50.262
That'll be reflected in my fee.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.931
But I still take 15
off the top.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.069
Is that all right with you?

34:08.814 --> 34:10.782
(clicks tongue, sighs)

34:10.816 --> 34:12.050
You did good.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.885
I'm proud of you, boy.

34:13.919 --> 34:16.288
So maybe you'll stop forgetting
I'm your partner, Mom,

34:16.322 --> 34:17.789
and let me make
my own decisions.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.191
What you talking about?

34:19.225 --> 34:22.128
What, little
Carmen Miranda, huh?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.862
Yeah, you better be making
decisions with your head

34:23.895 --> 34:25.897
and not with
your you-know-what.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.299
What, like you?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.468
I know about you
and pretty boy.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.902
Shut up, boy.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.304
I know what I'm doing.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.540
I've been doing it
longer than you.

34:34.573 --> 34:35.807
Well, I don't trust him.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.644
You don't know him.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.479
I'm just saying, Ma.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.514
Just be careful.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.460
*

34:54.493 --> 34:55.994
All hail the king.

34:57.863 --> 35:01.333
* They say heavy is the head
that wears a crown *

35:01.367 --> 35:03.335
* Wears a crown *

35:03.369 --> 35:06.272
* They say heavy is the head
that wears a crown *

35:06.305 --> 35:10.776
* Hey, they say heavy is
the head that wears a crown *

35:10.809 --> 35:14.446
* Always used to think that
that was just a damn excuse *

35:14.480 --> 35:16.448
* Something that the weak say

35:16.482 --> 35:19.351
* 'Cause they couldn't
hold it down *

35:19.385 --> 35:23.021
* But now that I wear it,
I know that to be true *

35:23.054 --> 35:24.756
* No complaining, no

35:24.790 --> 35:28.026
* Daddy raised a soldier
whether he knew it or not *

35:28.059 --> 35:32.598
* He supplied the pain, I put it
in the music, made it hot *

35:32.631 --> 35:34.700
* Strong back,
strong shoulders *

35:34.733 --> 35:36.968
* 'Cause I'm holding up a lot

35:37.002 --> 35:39.037
* I'm underneath this
supporting *

35:39.070 --> 35:40.872
* Same time I'm at the top

35:40.906 --> 35:43.141
* And I refuse to let
my people down... *

35:43.175 --> 35:45.544
Man, that is a song.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.045
That's better
than "Uproar."

35:47.078 --> 35:48.814
Yeah, I've been
working with him.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.949
Man, you elevated
his sound

35:50.982 --> 35:53.952
to another level.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.954
* Not just the crown

35:55.987 --> 35:58.390
* Feeling like this
whole damn kingdom's sitting *

35:58.424 --> 36:00.559
* On top of me, yeah
* Sitting on top of me *

36:00.592 --> 36:03.161
* Sitting on top of me *
* S-Sitting on top of me

36:03.195 --> 36:04.730
* Sitting on top of me *

36:04.763 --> 36:06.398
* Feeling like
this whole damn kingdom's *

36:06.432 --> 36:08.867
* Sitting on top of me.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.902
(objects clattering)

36:15.006 --> 36:17.008
(bullet clinks on floor)

36:38.530 --> 36:40.866
Let's go, ladies!
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

36:40.899 --> 36:42.768
* Go on, get your bottoms up

36:42.801 --> 36:44.536
* We're sipping
bottomless mimosa *

36:44.570 --> 36:46.372
* Pour me another dosa

36:46.405 --> 36:48.206

36:48.240 --> 36:50.108
* Still going, getting loca *

36:50.141 --> 36:51.777

36:51.810 --> 36:53.612

36:53.645 --> 36:55.013
* It's 10:00 a.m., we partying

36:55.046 --> 36:57.115
* Come on,

* All them girls

37:04.256 --> 37:07.793
* Let me go get you

37:07.826 --> 37:09.127
* Bottoms up, bottoms up

37:09.160 --> 37:11.263
* Go on, get your bottoms up.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.373
* Girl, you know you bad,

37:21.407 --> 37:23.208
* I wanna be next to you...

37:23.241 --> 37:25.043
I brought you a present.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.645
Is it my birthday?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.647
Oh, damn, it's Christmas.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.817
(chuckles) You got
a little freak in you.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.652
(chuckles)
I love you, too.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.554
And so does Jago Locke.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.222
He wants to be in
business with you.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.657
Get the hell out of here.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.058
It's done.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.993
Ooh.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.229
I love Mimi.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.230
Come on.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.598
Oh, where we going?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.268
(Mimi laughing,
Lucious chattering)

37:52.538 --> 37:54.506
* I know you've been
waiting for me... *

37:54.540 --> 37:58.544
I... would like
baby girl in the green.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.180
MIMI:
Mm-hmm. That's April.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.815
Spring is in the air.
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

38:06.284 --> 38:08.086
Well, I'm gonna
fight you for her.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.921
Oh, no, we don't fight.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.757
We are partners.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.092
We share.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.127
*

38:16.161 --> 38:18.597
LUCIOUS:
Time to make the donuts.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.532
(both laugh)

38:20.566 --> 38:22.534
I like doing business
with you.

38:22.568 --> 38:24.002
(laughs)

38:24.035 --> 38:26.605
You're just saying that so
that I let you go first, huh?

38:26.638 --> 38:28.206
LUCIOUS:
Mmm.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.041
(phone vibrating)

38:30.075 --> 38:31.577
(sighs)

38:33.078 --> 38:34.212
(groans)

38:34.245 --> 38:35.381
I got to take it.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.083
I'm sorry, I
got to take it.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.055
MIMI:
Please don't say that to me.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.893
It's just all taking
a little longer than expected.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.761
How can you say that?

38:51.763 --> 38:53.565
Have you...?

38:53.599 --> 38:56.301
(whispering): Is that the wifey
or the girlfriend?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.303
Baby...
Hey, no, no, gimme,
gimme-gimme-gimme, gimme that.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.506
Hey. Hey, whoever
the hell this is,

39:00.539 --> 39:02.741
you need to know that if
you gonna deal with Mimi,

39:02.774 --> 39:04.576
you gonna treat her
with the love and respect

39:04.610 --> 39:06.311
that she deserve, or you gonna
have to deal with me,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.747
and I'm Lucious
Lyon, you got that?

39:08.780 --> 39:10.181
Huh?!

39:14.185 --> 39:15.587
Hello?

39:15.621 --> 39:17.423
Babe...

39:17.456 --> 39:19.425
Look, Mimi, Mimi,
I'm sorry.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.427
But I promise you,
whatever's going on,

39:21.460 --> 39:23.261
it's gonna be all right.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.163
And whoever she is,
she needs to know

39:25.196 --> 39:27.098
that she's lucky
to have you.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.935
But right now, baby,
we got the springtime.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.671
Come on, let's not
lose it, okay?

39:32.704 --> 39:35.306
*

39:56.928 --> 39:58.930
(both laugh)

40:02.167 --> 40:05.537
* Call me by my name, oh

40:05.571 --> 40:09.407
* Tell me that it's my game

40:09.441 --> 40:12.811
* Roll me out your dice back

40:12.844 --> 40:14.813
* Back into my favor...

40:14.846 --> 40:15.814
Baby.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.649
Mm-hmm.

40:17.683 --> 40:20.652
Y'all might want to
get started without me.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.688
I'm gonna be a while.

40:24.355 --> 40:27.325
(chuckling)

40:27.358 --> 40:31.162
* Let me see your valor, hey

40:31.196 --> 40:35.066
* Left turn,
no right turn, you *

40:35.100 --> 40:38.637
* You could be my U-turn.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.719
*

41:01.993 --> 41:03.995
*

41:31.823 --> 41:33.424
Boom.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.829
Boom.
No!

41:39.931 --> 41:40.932
Boom.

41:42.768 --> 41:44.269
Boom.

41:46.271 --> 41:48.073
It's 4:00 in the morning.

41:48.106 --> 41:51.476
I got it. I figured out
what the song was missing.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.746
You're about to become
a part of my life story.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.782
*

41:58.516 --> 42:00.085
* Boom
(gun clicking rhythmically)

42:00.118 --> 42:01.419
(grunts)

42:01.452 --> 42:03.254
* Boom, boom

42:03.288 --> 42:04.656
* Boom

42:04.690 --> 42:08.093
* Boom, boom, boom...

42:08.126 --> 42:09.427
* Y'all want some

42:09.460 --> 42:10.762
* Come get some

42:10.796 --> 42:11.930
* Y'all want some

42:11.963 --> 42:13.264
* Come get some

42:13.298 --> 42:14.600
* Y'all want some

42:14.633 --> 42:15.934
* Come get some

42:15.967 --> 42:17.769
* Y'all want some!

42:17.803 --> 42:19.270
* If you ever been through it

42:19.304 --> 42:20.438
* Then I'm knowing
you got a feelin' *

42:20.471 --> 42:21.940
* You witness in the struggle

42:21.973 --> 42:23.842
* From the realest,
what the deal is *

42:23.875 --> 42:25.611
* They tried to lock me down,
but they created a monster *

42:25.644 --> 42:28.279
* I'm beating down your block
and nobody can stop us *

42:28.313 --> 42:30.348
* You was over there
talking all kinds of tough *

42:30.381 --> 42:32.784
* While you sipping on
your little bitty pick-me-up *

42:32.818 --> 42:34.786
* Well, you say you like
to play a little fisticuffs *

42:34.820 --> 42:37.689
* So when the whistle puffs,
I'm gonna call your bluff *

42:37.723 --> 42:40.225
* Words from a wise man,
never let 'em see your hand *

42:40.258 --> 42:41.727
* In the end, I bet
they all gon' understand *

42:41.760 --> 42:43.629
* You can't stop
what you can't see *

42:43.662 --> 42:45.463
* Standing here is only me

42:45.496 --> 42:47.465
* So place your bet
and go prepare for your defeat *

42:47.498 --> 42:49.901
* I told the new jack to set,
kid, guard your check *

42:49.935 --> 42:52.303
* There's a brother over there
wanna bounce your neck *

42:52.337 --> 42:54.039
* Ain't you 'fraid of that?
* 'Fraid of that *

42:54.072 --> 42:55.707
* Watch you fade to black

42:55.741 --> 42:57.542
* Fade to black *

42:57.575 --> 43:00.045
* Boom, boom, boom, boom
(gun clicking rhythmically)

43:00.078 --> 43:01.479
* Bang, bang, bang, bang
(rhythmic gunshots)

43:01.512 --> 43:02.714
And he goes...

43:02.748 --> 43:04.750
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

43:04.783 --> 43:06.985
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

43:07.018 --> 43:08.419
* Boom, boom, boom, boom...

43:08.453 --> 43:11.389
History in the making, Freda.

43:11.422 --> 43:12.523
History.

43:53.899 --> 43:55.033
Yeah.

43:55.066 --> 43:57.035
