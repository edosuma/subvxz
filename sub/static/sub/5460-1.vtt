[CHIMP CHATTERS]

04:04.880 --> 04:06.518
You lose.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.752
Again.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.076
I changed your flight sequence.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.072
That's enough.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.754
Pay attention.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.110
Pericles, stop! Or no treat!

04:23.920 --> 04:25.592
How well do I know you?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.951
Hey, there you are.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.309
Was the homo sapien mean to you?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.835
We all know it's just rocket envy.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.669
-Ever consider a boyfriend?
-Do I enjoy being miserable?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.070
-I'll stick with my chimps.
LEO: Hey.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.755
-I'm teaching him.
-You're teasing him.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.794
He's gene-spliced, chromosome-
enhanced. He can handle it.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.630
When you frustrate them, they lose
focus. They even get violent.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.838
Hey, Pericles,
you're gonna be a daddy.

05:39.720 --> 05:44.396
-Thought I saw a smirk on his face.
-The female was the aggressor.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.795
Hey, Leo. You got a postcard.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.709
Leo!

05:53.800 --> 05:56.189
It's been two years.
When are you coming home?

05:56.720 --> 05:59.109
Not too quick.
I'm enjoying that apartment.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.954
-No, we miss you!
-Are you flying yet?

06:02.160 --> 06:06.915
-Or are the chimps doing the work?
- We got something to tell you.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.553
When you gonna make
that kind of commitment--

06:36.240 --> 06:39.357
MAN 1 : Captain Davidson,
report to the bridge.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.996
FRANK : Found it.
HANSEN: It's moving like a storm.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.873
It is. It's an electromagnetic storm.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.675
LEO: The digital clocks are stopped.
MARIA: It's beautiful.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.190
-So is the sun till you get close.
HANSEN: This is weird.

07:01.400 --> 07:05.075
HANSEN: I hear frequency patterns.
-Tune them in.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.555
HANSEN: It's electronic communication
from Earth, from all time.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.439
HANSEN:
The storm's bouncing it back to us.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.837
We'll start with a pass
through the core.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.073
T ake radiation gamma-ray reading.
Get your monkey ready.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.158
Sir, this is a waste of time.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.032
We have standard procedures--

07:27.280 --> 07:31.159
-l' m aware of the procedures, but--
-No manned flights.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.029
We send an ape. If it's safe,
we talk about a pilot.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.118
Why don't you just allow me
to do my job?

07:38.320 --> 07:42.632
He's the canary, that's the coal mine.
He launches at 1 6:00.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.752
Just follow your sequence
and come home. Understand? Home.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.269
VASICH: Stand by. Alpha pod launch
in 30 seconds.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.312
VASICH: Chart his course
to the eye of the storm.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.669
LEO:
Okay, Pericles, start sequence one.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.796
LEO:
Activate reading systems.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.679
LEO:
Ignition.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.072
VASICH: Have him start
taking perimeter readings.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.790
-What's wrong?
-He's off-course.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.075
Lock on him.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.278
He can't respond, sir.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.917
-There's a surge in the heart rate.
-Light him up again.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.878
I can't.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.355
He's gone.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.672
He's trained to come back.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.476
You think he's still alive?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.039
-Sir--
-For now, we just sit tight and wait.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.478
I'm gonna run some sequences
to see what he did wrong.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.430
HANSEN: The signal is breaking up.
VASlCH: He must be panicking.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.551
ALEXANDER:
He'll return to the Oberon.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.153
HANSEN:
I can 't hold him.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.998
VASICH:
That's it, we lost him.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.835
FRANK: Wanna send up another chimp?
-It's too dangerous.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.076
VASICH:
I won 't waste another pod.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.709
VASICH:
Shut down launch operations.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.593
Sir?

10:48.840 --> 10:50.592
Delta pod has launched.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.635
Your flight is not authorized!

10:55.840 --> 10:57.592
I' m going to get my chimp.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.156
VASICH: Bring that thing back here!
Return to base!

11:01.360 --> 11:04.272
Never send a monkey to do a man's job.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.111
I got a visual on Alpha pod.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.231
Oberon, come back!

11:56.120 --> 11:58.190
Oberon, come in!

12:08.480 --> 12:11.438
-l' m getting a mayday, sir.
-Alpha pod?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.956
-I don't know, but it's strong.
VASICH: Put it up.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.156
Mayday! Mayday! Come in!

12:18.400 --> 12:21.836
Request-- We 're going down! Mayday!

12:23.760 --> 12:25.193

18:07.720 --> 18:09.711
GORILLA BOY 2:

19:01.240 --> 19:03.151
Hey, where am l?

19:05.400 --> 19:06.913
What is this place?

19:17.880 --> 19:20.678
Here! I'm open! Come on!

19:20.960 --> 19:23.633
Dribble it down! Take it!

19:26.760 --> 19:29.399
GORILLA 3:
Make way! Clear the path!

19:29.640 --> 19:31.198
GORILLA BOY 4:
Get the humans!

19:34.680 --> 19:36.910
GORILLA BOY 2:
You guys smell!

19:38.360 --> 19:39.793
GORILLA BOY 4:
Take this!

19:43.400 --> 19:45.550
GORILLA BOY 1 : Stupid human!
ARI: Stop it!

19:48.800 --> 19:52.429
-Who said to throw stones at humans?
-My father.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.312
Well, he's wrong.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.592
-And you can tell him I said so.
-Human-lover.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.674
GORILLA 5:
Move along!

20:24.320 --> 20:27.676
Are you trying
to put me out of business?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.276
These are the skankiest, scabbiest...

20:31.520 --> 20:34.080
...scuzziest humans I've ever seen.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.234
-You don't want them?
-I'll take the whole lot.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.400
I must be out of my mind.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.995
I'll have to make it up on volume.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.913
All right, get them out...

20:48.120 --> 20:50.714
...and get them clean! Chop, chop!

20:56.520 --> 20:57.714
Let's go!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.552
Keep it moving!

20:59.800 --> 21:01.313
Come on! Hurry up!

21:05.600 --> 21:09.195
LIMBO: Gentlemen to the left!
Ladies to the right, please!

21:09.600 --> 21:10.794
Don't be afraid.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.594
Come on.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.194
Very touching. I can't see
for the tears in my eyes.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.473
Come on. That one's
crawling with lice.

21:22.440 --> 21:26.115
Check the teeth
on that little one. Nice.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.871
Stay back. Back!

21:39.720 --> 21:41.551
Get in there!

21:45.160 --> 21:46.878
Move! You too!

21:48.000 --> 21:53.074
How many times have I told you to
wear gloves when you handle humans?

21:57.760 --> 22:00.718
You normally hack off a limb, Limbo.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.713
Yes, general. That's true.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.071
LIMBO: Unfortunately,
they're worth more intact.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.760
Keep your eye on this one.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.077
He's feisty.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.550
Were these the ones
raiding the orchards?

22:23.800 --> 22:27.839
I know an old country remedy
that never fails.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.835
You gut one human,
and you string the carcass up.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.669
The Human Rights faction
is on me already.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.674
Do-gooders. Who needs them?
I' m for free speech as long as they...

22:41.760 --> 22:43.113
...keep their mouths shut.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.474
My niece wants one
for her birthday.

22:46.800 --> 22:51.078
Excellent. The little ones
make wonderful pets.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.477
But be sure
you get rid of it by puberty.

22:54.680 --> 22:59.231
One thing you don't want in your
house, it's a human teenager.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.957
Any one you'd like, sweetheart.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.472
That one.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.878
Oh, isn't she pretty.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.756
I'll get that for you, sir.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.509
And I have a pretty new collar...

23:40.040 --> 23:41.837
...just for you.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.997
Compliments of the house.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.510
You stink of humans.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.952
It's disgusting
the way we treat humans.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.668
It demeans us as much as them.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.152
Ari, let's go.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.479
Get them marked!
I got orders to fill!

24:46.400 --> 24:48.072
Next!

25:02.080 --> 25:03.399
Not you again.

25:03.600 --> 25:08.196
I can't stand by while humans
are being mistreated and tortured.

25:09.960 --> 25:14.351
The only reason I put up with your
nonsense is because of your father!

25:14.560 --> 25:17.518
You want me to stop?
Give up the business.

25:17.720 --> 25:20.951
Hey, I do the job
that nobody else wants!

25:21.280 --> 25:24.670
I don't see you bleeding-hearts
spending all day...

25:24.880 --> 25:28.395
...with these dangerous,
dirty, dumb beasts.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.070
They can be taught
to live with us as equals.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.798
I'm gonna prove it.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.351
LIMBO:
Don't do that.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.796
Don't do that.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.634
Stay back.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.995
Well, now there's your proof.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.110
Now I'm gonna have to put him down.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.714
Help me.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.394
Please.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.033
Please help me.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.790
You're giving me such a headache.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.190
I don't need this aggravation!

26:08.480 --> 26:09.595
Sell him to me.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.276
Are you crazy? He's wild.
They're both wild.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.953
Then I'll buy them both.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.399
That would be expensive.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.910
That would be...

26:22.240 --> 26:24.151
...very, very expensive.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.073
I'm sure we can...

26:32.480 --> 26:34.710
...you know, come to a deal.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.755
You know?

26:43.360 --> 26:45.430
Deliver them to my house.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.190
SANDAR:
Semos, help me!

26:52.960 --> 26:55.520
Rise when your master enters.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.836
Wild humans...

27:02.880 --> 27:04.950
...in my house.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.351
This one seems different.

27:07.560 --> 27:11.951
How could he be different?
You can't tell one from the other!

27:12.160 --> 27:13.752
My guests are here.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.675
Keep the savage ones out of sight.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.555
Especially from General Thade!

27:25.240 --> 27:27.629
SANDAR:
You'd better be nice to him!

27:31.080 --> 27:33.958
And wash your hands before dinner.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.549
Senator, good evening.
Dear, you look lovely tonight.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.189
But I'm having a bad hair day.

27:47.440 --> 27:50.159
Yet, she spends a fortune grooming.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.391
And I'm worth every penny.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.310
Would you like to freshen up?

27:57.680 --> 27:58.829
We're fine.

28:14.880 --> 28:19.271
-How'd these monkeys get like this?
-How else would they be?

28:19.520 --> 28:24.310
-They'd be begging me for a treat.
-What tribe are you from?

28:25.040 --> 28:27.759
U.S. Air Force. I'm going back to it.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.870
Finish your work.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.750
Please, everyone sit.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.877
We just returned
from our country house.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.111
-How was it?
-Boring.

28:59.440 --> 29:03.911
I find it relaxing being away
from the bustle of the city.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.310
NOVA:
There was no place to go.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.632
Nothing but trees and rocks.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.877
-All you did was nap.
-Exactly.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.515
Time away from politics...

29:15.720 --> 29:17.517
...is what I needed.

29:18.840 --> 29:23.311
We'd lose ourselves for days
in the forest when we were young.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.636
Now I can barely climb a tree.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.869
T rite but true:
"Youth is wasted on the young. "

29:31.160 --> 29:35.073
Oh, how did I get so old so fast?

29:35.280 --> 29:39.558
Living with your daughter
would age any ape quickly.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.194
SANDAR:
You've been a stranger lately.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.472
I apologize for my lateness, senator.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.196
I stopped to see my father.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.437
-How's my old friend?
-Slipping, I'm afraid.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.838
I'd like to see him more,
but these are troubled days.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.230
The humans infest the provinces.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.670
We encroach upon their habitat.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.111
They breed while we grow soft
in our affluence.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.675
THADE:
They outnumber us four to one!

30:08.880 --> 30:11.348
Why can't we simply
sterilize them all?

30:12.160 --> 30:14.230
The cost would be prohibitive.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.676
Although scientists tell me...

30:16.920 --> 30:20.117
...these humans
carry terrible diseases.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.673
How would we know?

30:21.880 --> 30:25.429
The army burns the bodies
before they' re examined.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.394
Father?

30:35.200 --> 30:39.637
At times, perhaps, the senate feels
that the army has been...

30:39.840 --> 30:41.432
...a tad extreme.

30:41.640 --> 30:46.839
Extremism in defense of apes
is no vice, senator!
