Woman:
There's this guy,
he's a bricklayer.

02:22.631 --> 02:24.255
He's really good at it.

02:24.339 --> 02:26.506
He's a real master

02:26.589 --> 02:28.422
because he's precise.

02:28.506 --> 02:30.923
Every brick has its place.

02:36.005 --> 02:37.506
Anyway, this guy
has a daughter

02:37.589 --> 02:38.964
and he's gonna teach her
to be a bricklayer,

02:39.047 --> 02:42.547
because, after all,
all a man has is his legacy.

02:43.798 --> 02:46.339
So Dad decides to build
a barbecue in the backyard.

02:46.422 --> 02:50.255
He does the math,
he figures out
exactly what he needs,

02:50.339 --> 02:52.798
and he shows the daughter
how to do everything,

02:52.881 --> 02:55.172
step-by-step.

02:55.255 --> 02:57.798
And when he finishes,
it's a beauty.

02:57.881 --> 02:59.422
It's a perfect barbecue,

02:59.506 --> 03:02.297
just the way he drew it
in the blueprints.

03:02.964 --> 03:04.756
Only one problem...

03:06.381 --> 03:09.214
There's a brick left over.

03:09.964 --> 03:13.673
One... single... brick.

03:13.756 --> 03:15.506
The guy freaks out.

03:15.589 --> 03:17.422
He must've done
something wrong.

03:17.506 --> 03:20.005
He's going to have
to start all over again.

03:20.089 --> 03:22.506
So he picks up his sledgehammer
to knock the thing to pieces

03:22.589 --> 03:27.089

"Daddy, wait. I have an idea."

03:27.172 --> 03:29.631
She picks up the orphan brick

03:29.714 --> 03:32.255

08:14.047 --> 08:15.798
Am I going out of town, Joe?

08:15.881 --> 08:18.756
Tomorrow, the deputy director

08:32.756 --> 08:35.255
A little.
He was a good man.

08:35.339 --> 08:37.339
His wife ran
my senate campaign.

08:37.798 --> 08:40.130
Folks assume
the Seventh Kavalry did it.

08:40.214 --> 08:41.839
But that's not what you assume.

08:41.923 --> 08:44.089
7K always takes credit
when they kill a cop,

08:44.172 --> 08:46.130
but not a peep
from them on this.

08:46.923 --> 08:48.214
You think it was a vigilante?

08:48.297 --> 08:50.464
-Sure could be.
-Why?

08:51.047 --> 08:52.839
Call it professional jealousy.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.631
Vigilantes already see
cops as the enemy.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.172
Now they got mask envy on top.

08:56.255 --> 08:59.464
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
put the cops in masks, Joe.

08:59.547 --> 09:00.923
It works.

09:01.547 --> 09:04.339
Crime's down 80% in Tulsa
since we passed DOPA.

09:04.422 --> 09:07.005
-And other cities--
-You called it DOPA?

09:07.089 --> 09:09.047
The Defense of Police Act.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.130
And it's such a great
acronym that other cities

09:11.214 --> 09:12.714
wanna jump on board
and pilot it.

09:12.798 --> 09:15.839
Atlanta, New Orleans,
even goddamn Denver.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.756
Masks save lives.

09:17.839 --> 09:21.547
My reputation, my name
is built on that idea.

09:21.631 --> 09:24.422
Now, those cops have kept
the peace down there
for three years,

09:24.506 --> 09:26.381
and now someone's
trying to start a war.

09:26.464 --> 09:29.756
And if they do,
it all goes to shit.

09:30.381 --> 09:33.005
And you don't get
to be president.

09:36.297 --> 09:38.214
You know, Laurie...

09:38.297 --> 09:40.422
the president can pardon
anybody he wants.

09:40.506 --> 09:41.923

09:42.005 --> 09:44.798
He could even get

10:05.839 --> 10:09.381

Okay. Forget the brick.
New joke.

10:10.547 --> 10:13.964
Three heroes die, and they all
show up at the pearly gates.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.964
God's there to decide what
their eternal fate shall be.

10:17.047 --> 10:20.047
Heaven... or Hell.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.881
Our first hero is
dressed up like a big owl.

10:22.964 --> 10:25.130
And God says to him,
"I gifted you

10:25.214 --> 10:27.422
"the ability to make
fantastic inventions.

10:27.506 --> 10:30.631
What did you do
with this amazing talent?"

10:30.714 --> 10:35.214
And Owl Guy says, "I made
this really awesome flying ship

10:35.297 --> 10:37.798
"and lots of cool
outfits and weapons,

10:37.881 --> 10:40.297
so that I could bring
peace to the city."

10:41.047 --> 10:44.547
God asks, "So how many
people did you kill?"

10:46.047 --> 10:47.631
Owl Guy seems offended.

10:47.714 --> 10:51.381
"Zero," he says,
I didn't take a single life."

10:52.464 --> 10:56.339
God frowns.
"Sorry, Owl Guy.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.255
"Your heart's
in the right place,

10:58.339 --> 11:00.714
but you're just too soft."

11:02.214 --> 11:04.255
And God snaps his fingers.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.923
(snaps)

11:07.005 --> 11:09.214
And the hero goes to Hell.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.839
Deputy Director:
Seventh Kavalry.

11:14.923 --> 11:18.297
Apparently, it's
a Custer's Last Stand thing,
but who gives a shit.

11:18.381 --> 11:20.756
They're just the Klan
with different masks.

11:21.255 --> 11:26.214
They first popped up
after the Victims of Racial
Violence Act was passed.

11:26.297 --> 11:29.255
African-Americans come to Tulsa
to claim their benefits,

11:29.339 --> 11:31.839
they buy land, start businesses.

11:31.923 --> 11:34.255
And we all know how
accommodating white folks are

11:34.339 --> 11:37.255
when people of color
dare to prosper.

11:37.339 --> 11:39.756
But in Robbie Redford's America,

11:39.839 --> 11:43.464
the cops protect everybody,
so they push back.

11:43.547 --> 11:47.506
They ID everyone in Tulsa
who's supremacist-adjacent,

11:47.589 --> 11:50.172
search their houses,
take their guns--

11:50.255 --> 11:52.464
even the grandfathered ones.

11:52.547 --> 11:54.589
But obviously,
they missed a few--

11:57.005 --> 11:58.381
What the hell is this?

11:58.464 --> 12:02.881
Oh, it's, uh... an excerpt
from Rorschach's journal.

12:02.964 --> 12:05.381
The Kavalry wears
his mask, sir.

12:05.464 --> 12:09.047
I just thought, for, uh,
psychological context,

12:09.130 --> 12:11.756
-you might want to--
-Is it the 1980s, Petey?

12:11.839 --> 12:14.881
Uh, mm-mm, no sir.

12:14.964 --> 12:17.005
Then who gives a shit
about Rorschach?

12:17.089 --> 12:18.464
Next slide.

12:19.714 --> 12:23.172
Coordinated simultaneous attacks
at the homes of Tulsa PD.

12:23.255 --> 12:25.172
Not just the cops,
their families, too.

12:25.255 --> 12:29.964
Only a few survivors,
including Judd Crawford.

12:30.964 --> 12:32.923
Couple others get shot and stay,

12:33.005 --> 12:34.756
the rest of the force quits.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.756
And there's no way
to recruit new cops,

12:36.839 --> 12:40.464
because how do you
guarantee the Kavalry
won't just do it again?

12:40.547 --> 12:42.798
Enter Senator Giddyup.

12:43.506 --> 12:45.214
"If y'all can fight
fire with fire,

12:45.297 --> 12:47.506
y'all can fight
masks with masks!"

12:48.089 --> 12:50.214
Bright yellow ones.

12:50.673 --> 12:53.005
So, the cops hide their faces,

12:53.089 --> 12:55.130
and the bad guys
don't know where they live.

12:55.923 --> 12:59.798
And who doesn't want
a secret identity.
Right, Blake?

13:00.506 --> 13:01.756
Right, boss.

13:02.506 --> 13:06.339
Deputy Director:
Peace returns to Tulsa,
until last week.

13:06.422 --> 13:10.589
Cut to:
Chief Judd Crawford, in a tree,

13:10.673 --> 13:14.673
H-A-N-G-I-N-G.

13:16.673 --> 13:17.839
Lights.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.673
Blake's running point.
Jet's on the tarmac.

13:21.756 --> 13:23.297
You're all wheels up
in two hours,

13:23.381 --> 13:24.839
-so grab your--
-No. Just me.

13:24.923 --> 13:25.798
What?

13:25.881 --> 13:27.130
Tulsa PD's never
gonna cooperate

13:27.214 --> 13:29.005
if an army of suits
falls from the sky.

13:29.089 --> 13:31.047
I can point all by myself.

13:31.130 --> 13:34.464
Laurie, you can't go
in there alone.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.673
(sighs)
Fine. I'll, uh, take...

13:39.589 --> 13:41.172
...him.

13:42.214 --> 13:45.047
(agents murmuring)

13:47.547 --> 13:51.714
(jet engine roaring)

14:03.923 --> 14:06.089
Pilot: (over PA)
We're beginning our
descent into Tulsa.

14:06.172 --> 14:08.214
Agents, please buckle up.

14:15.297 --> 14:16.923
Petey:
I brought one too.

14:20.923 --> 14:24.381
-It's got holes in it.
-Oh, it's not for sleeping.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.756
In the briefing,
Director Farragut said...

14:27.673 --> 14:31.464
uh, I just thought
if the police wear them...

14:31.547 --> 14:33.631
When in Rome, right?

14:34.130 --> 14:35.631
Tulsa's not Rome.

14:36.255 --> 14:40.047
And you're a federal agent,
not the Lone Fucking Ranger.

14:42.964 --> 14:45.214
Right. Gotcha.

14:45.297 --> 14:48.714
-(PA chimes)
-Pilot (over PA): If you wanna
take a look out the window,

14:48.798 --> 14:52.464
we've got a bird's-eye view
of the Millennium Clock.

15:05.756 --> 15:09.089
"Look on my works,
ye mighty, and despair."

15:09.589 --> 15:10.839
What?

15:11.673 --> 15:12.881
That's what Lady Trieu said

15:12.964 --> 15:15.381
at the groundbreaking
for the clock.

15:15.464 --> 15:20.964
A... hmm... shout out
to Adrian Veidt after
she bought his company.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.589
They finally declared him dead,

15:24.673 --> 15:27.381
but I've got a buddy
on the Argentina desk

15:27.464 --> 15:29.381
who says Veidt got
plastic surgery,

15:29.464 --> 15:31.839
and he's now living
incognito down there.

15:33.047 --> 15:35.255
You knew him, right?
Back in the old days?

15:35.339 --> 15:37.756
When he was Ozymandias?

15:37.839 --> 15:39.005
(spits)

15:39.339 --> 15:42.255
-You want my autograph?
-What?

15:42.339 --> 15:44.756
Well, you've clearly have
a hard-on for the past,

15:44.839 --> 15:47.339
so, what do you
want me to sign?

15:48.547 --> 15:53.214
I wrote my graduate thesis
on the police strike of '77,

15:53.297 --> 15:55.839
when you and your ex
were in D.C.

15:55.923 --> 15:59.381
and by "ex" I mean
Dr. Manhattan,

16:00.172 --> 16:03.339
the most powerful
being in existence.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.339
Sorry for not pretending
that I don't know who you are

16:06.422 --> 16:09.881
because we're supposed
to leave "famous" people
alone, but...

16:09.964 --> 16:13.047
you brought me here,
Agent Blake.

16:13.547 --> 16:15.714
And before I was
recruited by the FBI

16:15.798 --> 16:17.714
to run the slide projector,

16:17.798 --> 16:19.714
I had a PhD in history.

16:20.506 --> 16:21.881
So...

16:22.881 --> 16:25.547
Please don't treat me
like I'm some kind of...

16:26.923 --> 16:28.673
fan.

16:34.547 --> 16:36.673
Yeah. I knew Adrian Veidt.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.881
I too am not a fan.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.756
(wheels thumping)

16:49.547 --> 16:51.381
Blake:
Oh, where was I?

16:51.464 --> 16:53.923
(clears throat)
Oh. Right, right.

16:54.631 --> 16:56.172
(sighs)

16:56.255 --> 17:02.005
The pearly gates await
our next hero in line
for almighty judgment.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.506
Our Hero Number Two is
confident he can game this out,

17:04.589 --> 17:09.339
because that's his
God-given talent-- smarts.

17:09.422 --> 17:13.506
Some might even say he was
the smartest man in the world.

17:13.589 --> 17:16.673
"So, what'd you do
with that big brain
I gave you?" asks God.

17:16.756 --> 17:18.339
"Well, as a matter of fact,

17:18.422 --> 17:21.798
I saved humanity,"
says Smarty-pants.

17:21.881 --> 17:25.172
"Well, how'd you
do that?" asks God.

17:25.255 --> 17:30.714
"Well, I dropped a giant
alien squid on New York.

17:30.798 --> 17:32.422
"And everybody was
so afraid of it,

17:32.506 --> 17:34.589
they stopped being
afraid of each other."

17:36.381 --> 17:40.506
"Okay," says God. "Um..."

17:41.714 --> 17:43.714
"How many people
did you kill?"

17:43.798 --> 17:46.005
Smarty-pants smiles.

17:46.089 --> 17:48.339
"Three million, give or take.

17:48.422 --> 17:51.589
But you can't make
an omelette without
breaking a couple eggs."

17:52.464 --> 17:54.255
"Christ," God says,

17:54.339 --> 17:57.422
"You're a fucking monster."

17:58.130 --> 18:00.506
"Am not!" says Smarty-pants.

18:02.005 --> 18:03.339
God snaps his fingers.

18:04.464 --> 18:06.464
The hero goes to Hell.

18:06.964 --> 18:09.631
(distant train whistle blows)

18:17.089 --> 18:19.673
Maybe it's
the wrong warehouse?

18:19.756 --> 18:21.547
(spits)
Yeah?

18:21.631 --> 18:23.964
Is that what your PhD
in history tells you?

18:28.547 --> 18:30.339
Here.
Don't eat those.

18:31.839 --> 18:32.923
Wait here.

18:33.005 --> 18:35.339
Oh, uh, right.
Shouldn't I--?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.089
(zip ties zipping)

18:56.047 --> 18:57.506
Blake:
Hey, there!

18:59.547 --> 19:01.172
What are you guys up to?

19:01.714 --> 19:03.589
Who the fuck are you?

19:03.673 --> 19:05.422
Special Agent Laurie Blake.

19:06.005 --> 19:07.381
Who the fuck are you?

19:09.547 --> 19:10.714
Pirate Jenny.

19:11.547 --> 19:12.923
Red Scare.

19:13.005 --> 19:15.381
Wow. Cool.

19:16.172 --> 19:17.756
Sir, I'm with the FBI.

19:17.839 --> 19:19.506
Are your civil rights
being violated?

19:19.589 --> 19:21.130
Uh... Yes, ma'am.

19:21.214 --> 19:23.964
These people came into
my place of business
and they just grabbed me.

19:24.047 --> 19:25.255
They didn't read me
my rights or--

19:25.339 --> 19:27.714
Okay. Sorry, I was just kidding.
I don't care.

19:27.798 --> 19:30.673
Uh, I'm looking for someone
named "Looking Glass."

19:31.714 --> 19:33.381
Is he in there?

19:40.255 --> 19:42.756
-(dogs barking)
-(noisy chattering)

19:46.047 --> 19:48.547
Cop: Shut your mouth,
bitch! Shut up!

19:54.255 --> 19:56.047
(dog barking)

19:56.130 --> 19:58.255
(shouting angrily)

20:13.714 --> 20:15.130
Cop:
Open your mouth.

20:18.464 --> 20:21.631
Looking Glass is in the pod.
Is he expecting you?

20:22.506 --> 20:24.089
Boy, I sure hope not.

20:26.881 --> 20:29.089
-(dog barks)
-(man whimpers)

20:31.130 --> 20:33.047
Looking Glass:
For the safety
of our officers,

20:33.130 --> 20:35.422
we're gonna have to put
the blindfold back on you

20:35.506 --> 20:37.130
before we can
send you back.

20:39.339 --> 20:42.297
He's clear.
Take him off the board.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.464
Blake:
Hey.

20:47.464 --> 20:50.631
I-I know there's a line,
but could I go next?

20:58.172 --> 21:00.881
-Please don't touch--
-What does this thing do?

21:00.964 --> 21:02.839
-(electricity whirs)
-Looking Glass:
It's complicated.

21:04.547 --> 21:05.881
Try me.

21:05.964 --> 21:09.798
It determines and exposes
negative cultural biases

21:09.881 --> 21:12.381
to which the suspect
might otherwise not admit.

21:12.464 --> 21:16.214
-So it's a racist detector.
-That's an oversimplification.

21:17.506 --> 21:19.422
So I'm guessing
all these blindfolded

21:19.506 --> 21:21.923
gentlemen and ladies out here
are suspected Seventh Kavalry?

21:22.005 --> 21:24.756
Any of them confess
to murdering your chief?

21:24.839 --> 21:27.547
Not as of yet, no.

21:33.130 --> 21:36.839
Sorry, I got a seed stuck
there or something.

21:36.923 --> 21:39.881
You know, you wear
a mirror on your face,
people are gonna use it.

21:40.547 --> 21:44.214
Or you could just take
that silly mask off, Wade.

21:47.255 --> 21:49.547
Or do you prefer
Detective Tillman?

21:52.005 --> 21:53.923
Wade's fine.

21:57.130 --> 22:00.214
May I have the control
back, please?

22:06.297 --> 22:07.881
(control beeps)

22:08.881 --> 22:11.005
How may I help you,
Agent Blake?

22:11.798 --> 22:14.047
Tell me about
your chief's autopsy.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.631
Ligature marks,
petechial hemorrhaging,

22:16.714 --> 22:19.297
combined asphyxia
and venous congestion.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.172
Absolutely zero doubt
he was hanged.

22:22.255 --> 22:23.673
Was there a tox screen?

22:23.756 --> 22:27.422
I'm guessin' you've read
the report, so you know
there ain't.

22:27.506 --> 22:29.172
Why "ain't" there?

22:29.255 --> 22:32.422
No need.
Cause of death is clear.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.255
You're right.
It totally is.

22:35.339 --> 22:38.089
So this raid the other night
at the cattle ranch?

22:38.172 --> 22:40.339
-I wasn't there.
-Yes, I know.

22:40.422 --> 22:43.005
But the report says
you got the location

22:43.089 --> 22:45.339
from a suspect here
in the racist detector.

22:45.422 --> 22:46.756
It's not a ra--

22:49.381 --> 22:52.005
If you've read the report,
you've watched the tapes.

22:52.089 --> 22:55.339
And if you've watched the tapes,
you know he didn't talk.

22:55.422 --> 22:57.422
Oh, you're smart, Wade.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.339
Okay, so who did
he give the location to?

22:59.422 --> 23:03.839
Sister Night obtained the intel
in a secondary interrogation.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.673
Is that Tulsa for
"beat the shit out of him"?

23:05.756 --> 23:07.422
I did not personally observe

23:07.506 --> 23:09.714
any violence
against the suspect.

23:09.798 --> 23:12.381
So, this Sister Night...

23:12.464 --> 23:14.381
would that be Angela Abar?

23:14.464 --> 23:17.589
(pen scribbling)

23:20.339 --> 23:22.464
(scribbling stops)

23:27.673 --> 23:29.005
Yes, it would.

23:30.464 --> 23:32.255
Is she around?

23:33.422 --> 23:35.172
She took a personal day

23:35.255 --> 23:38.506
to work on her eulogy
for the chief's funeral.

23:38.589 --> 23:40.631
Jesus. When's that?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.506
In a couple hours.

23:47.547 --> 23:48.923
Well...

23:49.005 --> 23:51.798
Guess I better change
into something darker.

24:01.422 --> 24:03.589
Blake:
Okay.

24:03.673 --> 24:05.839
We're down
to the nitty-gritty now.

24:06.673 --> 24:08.172
One hero left.

24:08.923 --> 24:10.130
God cracks his knuckles,

24:10.214 --> 24:14.714
ready to administer
the final reckoning.

24:14.798 --> 24:18.589
Now, Hero Number Three is
pretty much a god himself .

24:18.673 --> 24:21.422
So for the sake
of telling them apart,

24:21.506 --> 24:23.214
he's blue...

24:23.297 --> 24:26.631
and he likes to stroll around
with his dick hanging out.

24:26.714 --> 24:31.297
He can teleport.
He can see into the future.

24:31.381 --> 24:35.005
He can blow shit up.
He's got actual superpowers.

24:35.089 --> 24:37.005
So Regular God asks Blue God,

24:37.089 --> 24:39.547
"What have you done
with these gifts?"
And Blue God says,

24:39.631 --> 24:45.089
"I fell in love with a woman,
I walked across the sun,

24:45.172 --> 24:47.756
"and then I fell in love
with another woman.

24:47.839 --> 24:50.547
"I won the Vietnam War.

24:52.381 --> 24:56.172
But mostly, I just stopped
giving a shit about humanity."

24:58.923 --> 25:01.464
God sighs.

25:01.547 --> 25:05.214
"Do I even need to ask
how many people you've killed?"

25:07.047 --> 25:09.339
Blue God shrugs.

25:09.422 --> 25:12.506
"A live body and a dead body
have the same number
of particles,

25:12.589 --> 25:15.005
"so it doesn't matter.

25:15.089 --> 25:17.047
"And it doesn't matter
how I answer your question,

25:17.130 --> 25:19.964
because I know you're
sending me to Hell."

25:20.047 --> 25:23.172
"How do you know that?"
asks God.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.839
And Blue God sounds
very, very sad

25:26.923 --> 25:28.881
when he softly says,

25:28.964 --> 25:31.422
"Because I'm already there."

25:33.381 --> 25:35.339
And so, a mere piston

25:35.422 --> 25:37.756
in the inevitable machinery
of time and space,

25:37.839 --> 25:40.631
God does what he did
and what he will do:

25:41.297 --> 25:44.130
he snaps his fingers.

25:46.005 --> 25:48.589
And the hero goes to Hell.

25:55.964 --> 25:58.047
-(protesters shouting)
-(dog barking)

25:58.130 --> 26:00.047
Y'all are gonna have
to surrender any firearms.

26:00.130 --> 26:03.589
-We're, uh, federal off--
-Give the man your gun, Petey.

26:03.673 --> 26:05.756
Show some damn respect.

26:09.589 --> 26:12.089
(protesters shouting)

26:19.631 --> 26:22.673
(shouting continues)

26:52.339 --> 26:54.464
Blake:
Angela Abar...

26:55.047 --> 26:56.839
Laurie Blake, FBI.

26:56.923 --> 26:58.631
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

26:58.714 --> 27:00.381
Cal. Hi.

27:01.631 --> 27:03.297
-Do I know you?
-No, no, no.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.464
You don't. I'm sorry.
We've never met,

27:05.547 --> 27:08.089
but I heard that you were
close with the Crawfords,

27:08.172 --> 27:10.422
and I'm here to help.

27:10.506 --> 27:14.255
And I'm hoping you and I
can grab some coffee
and talk sometime soon.

27:14.923 --> 27:19.589
I'm not a cop anymore.
I retired three years ago.

27:19.673 --> 27:21.964
Oh, I know.
And I totally understand.

27:22.047 --> 27:25.214
You have a family,
and it's so dangerous.

27:27.673 --> 27:31.255
Here, let me
give you my card.

27:31.339 --> 27:33.089
My pager's on there.

27:33.172 --> 27:35.255
So, please feel free
to give me a buzz.

27:36.172 --> 27:38.673
"Anti-Vigilante Task Force."

27:39.547 --> 27:43.381
You know how you can tell
the difference between
a masked cop and a vigilante?

27:44.589 --> 27:46.047
No.

27:46.422 --> 27:48.047
Me neither.

27:49.714 --> 27:53.339
Again, my deepest condolences.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.547
Bye.

27:57.381 --> 28:00.631
-Sergeant-At-Arms:
Ready! Aim! Pull!
-(gunshots echo)

28:00.714 --> 28:03.964
-Ready! Aim! Pull!
-(gunshots echo)

28:04.047 --> 28:06.756
-Ready! Aim! Pull!
-(gunshots echo)

28:07.714 --> 28:09.756
(shouts indistinct command)

28:12.631 --> 28:14.714
(sighs)
Well...

28:14.798 --> 28:17.172
Thank you all
for being here.

28:17.255 --> 28:19.130
And, uh...

28:20.422 --> 28:22.923
Thank you for
honoring my husband.

28:23.923 --> 28:25.881
He loved this work.

28:27.047 --> 28:31.798
But he loved
all of you even more.

28:33.756 --> 28:35.089
Angela...

28:35.756 --> 28:39.506
I can't think of a better
person to speak about Judd

28:39.589 --> 28:42.172
before we lay him to rest.

28:53.130 --> 28:57.339
Most of you know
the chief and me...

28:57.422 --> 28:59.047
and I...

28:59.130 --> 29:02.839
we both were shot
on the same night.

29:02.923 --> 29:05.339
-(clock ticking)
-So many others died.

29:06.798 --> 29:08.547
We were lucky.

29:08.631 --> 29:12.255
We knew we might not
always be lucky, and...

29:13.297 --> 29:15.339
we should be prepared.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.589
So we made a pact.

29:18.673 --> 29:22.673
I told him what I would want
him to say at my funeral,

29:22.756 --> 29:25.839
and he told me
what to say at his.

34:05.047 --> 34:07.381
I never doubted you, Master.

34:07.464 --> 34:08.673
That, Mr. Philips,

34:08.756 --> 34:12.130
is because you are
incapable of doubt.

34:15.547 --> 34:18.631
Nevertheless, I appreciate
the sentiment.

34:21.005 --> 34:22.506
Oh.

34:23.631 --> 34:25.005
Master:
Right.

34:29.089 --> 34:32.214
Are you ready to venture
into the great beyond?

34:32.297 --> 34:35.172
Oh. Yes, I am, sir.

35:26.547 --> 35:29.422
Damn it. Damn it!

Shit! Fuck! Shit!

35:32.130 --> 35:35.756
Shit and shit and fuck!

(shouts, grunts)

35:46.381 --> 35:48.422
What went wrong, Master?

35:51.089 --> 35:53.881
I think we're going to need
a thicker skin.

(clears throat)
I'm so sorry
to disturb you, Master.

37:48.839 --> 37:50.506
But there's a letter.

37:51.923 --> 37:53.506
From the game warden.

37:55.547 --> 37:57.005
Read it to me.

37:58.589 --> 38:02.464
Let's see what our adversary
has to say for himself.

38:07.130 --> 38:11.631
-"Dear Mas--"
-Oh, dispense with the flowery
pleasantries and get to it.

38:11.714 --> 38:15.255
"I beg your pardon, sir,
but when you first arrived here,

38:15.339 --> 38:18.464
"we agreed upon
the terms of your captivity.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.089
"Your recent behavior suggests

38:20.172 --> 38:22.214
an intention to violate
those terms."

38:22.297 --> 38:24.214
-Hmm.
-"As such,

38:24.297 --> 38:25.798
"if this behavior continues,

38:25.881 --> 38:28.881
you will face
grave consequences."

38:32.339 --> 38:34.297
He's underscored
"consequences."

38:34.381 --> 38:36.631
-Mm.
-"Know this--

38:36.714 --> 38:39.631
"The next shot I fire, sir,
will not be at your feet.

38:39.714 --> 38:42.964
"Please consider this
your first and only warning.

38:43.047 --> 38:46.130
"Thank you again for
the delicious tomatoes.

38:46.214 --> 38:49.547
Your humble servant,
The Game Warden."

38:52.381 --> 38:54.798
To the typewriter,
Crookshanks!

38:59.422 --> 39:03.631
Let's see what this devious
cur is made of, shall we?

39:03.714 --> 39:06.381
-Oh, yes, we shall, Master!
-Mm.

39:07.172 --> 39:08.964
Most Honorable Game Warden.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.130
-(typewriter clacking)
-I beg your pardon, sir,

39:11.214 --> 39:14.422
but you seem to suspect me
of criminal activities

39:14.506 --> 39:18.297
as if I were a dastardly
forest brigand.

39:18.381 --> 39:23.589
Or worse, some sort of
republic serial villain.

39:24.297 --> 39:25.297
I am neither, sir,

39:25.381 --> 39:29.756
And I assure you
that my activities

39:29.839 --> 39:34.422
are purely recreational
in nature.

39:35.297 --> 39:38.005
Furthermore,
I would never imagine

39:38.089 --> 39:41.172
to transgress the terms
upon which we agreed.

39:42.005 --> 39:46.714
I am available, at your
leisure and by your grace,

39:46.798 --> 39:50.422
to discuss this matter further
should you wish to repeat

39:50.506 --> 39:53.422
your ridiculous accusations
in person.

39:55.130 --> 39:57.756
That said, I'm pleased
you enjoyed the tomatoes.

39:57.839 --> 40:02.839
All the best wishes
and encouragement,

40:04.130 --> 40:06.839
Adrian Veidt.

40:08.464 --> 40:10.798
What do you think,
Ms. Crookshanks?

40:11.923 --> 40:15.089
Oh, this will have him quaking
in his boots, Master!

40:16.381 --> 40:18.005
I'll have it sent right away.

40:19.464 --> 40:21.631
Have Mr. Philips
restring my bow

40:21.714 --> 40:23.839
and saddle up Bucephalus.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.714
I hunt again at midnight!

40:55.339 --> 40:57.381
(thundering)

40:57.464 --> 40:59.756
Senator Keene:
I am not the hero here.

40:59.839 --> 41:03.464
I'm only standing here
talking to y'all right now

41:03.547 --> 41:07.756
because of the swift
and fearless actions
of law enforcement.

41:07.839 --> 41:10.839
They are the heroes.
They kept me safe.

41:10.923 --> 41:13.798
And I'll be damned
if I won't keep fighting
to do the same for them.

41:13.881 --> 41:15.172
Reporter:
Senator Keene--

41:15.255 --> 41:18.005
Why do you think you were
targeted by the Kavalry?

41:18.089 --> 41:20.422
I reckon it's because nothing
scares a terrorist more

41:20.506 --> 41:22.130
than someone
they can't terrify.

41:22.214 --> 41:25.130
Can you comment on
the Russians building
an intrinsic field generator?

41:25.214 --> 41:26.339
Keene:
Guys...

41:26.422 --> 41:28.464
when they swore me in,
I promised to defend us

41:28.547 --> 41:30.964
from all enemies
foreign and domestic.

41:31.047 --> 41:35.130
But I represent the people
of the great state of Oklahoma,

41:35.214 --> 41:37.464
and the Russians
ain't my problem.

41:37.547 --> 41:39.839
The goddamned
Seventh Kavalry is.

41:40.506 --> 41:43.005
Right now, here is
where the war's at.

41:43.089 --> 41:45.589
And I won't be leaving
until it's won.

41:46.297 --> 41:48.422
Good night and God Bless.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.798
(reporters shouting questions)

41:54.798 --> 41:56.839
Well, he's got my vote.

41:56.923 --> 41:59.214
Are you even old
enough to vote?

42:00.714 --> 42:03.756
So, can I get
that autograph now or...?

42:04.964 --> 42:07.297
That was almost
funny, Petey.

42:07.923 --> 42:10.798
-You drink any of that yet?
-No. Why?

42:56.381 --> 42:58.422
How about that coffee now?

43:01.798 --> 43:03.589
Where's it go?

43:04.339 --> 43:07.130
(sighs)
Just outside the fence.

43:07.214 --> 43:09.464
Gotta be 300 meters long.

43:09.547 --> 43:12.255
Must've used some kind've drill
to get it done that fast.

43:12.339 --> 43:14.673
Don't rule out
extremist gophers.

43:19.589 --> 43:21.130
How are your children?

43:22.422 --> 43:23.673
Safe.

43:24.881 --> 43:26.923
(sighs)
I thought he was bluffing.

43:27.673 --> 43:29.923
Those fuckers always say
the device is rigged
to their hearts,

43:30.005 --> 43:32.297
and none of them actually
take the time to do it.

43:33.631 --> 43:35.673
You saved us. Thanks.

43:36.297 --> 43:37.923
Crawford jumped
on the grenade.

43:38.005 --> 43:41.005
I just gave him
a little push.

43:42.381 --> 43:44.255
Yeah, well...
(chuckles)

43:44.339 --> 43:46.547
I sure as shit can't
exhume him now.

43:47.464 --> 43:48.881
That's not funny.

43:49.673 --> 43:51.673
Sorry. I wasn't joking.

43:51.756 --> 43:53.964
You guys just scheduled
this funeral so fast.

43:54.047 --> 43:55.339
Kinda weird considering

43:55.422 --> 43:57.756
it's an active murder
investigation by the way,

43:57.839 --> 43:59.130
but, uh...

43:59.214 --> 44:01.547
we were literally gonna
dig him up tomorrow.

44:01.631 --> 44:03.589
Discretely, of course.

44:04.714 --> 44:06.005
Why?

44:08.673 --> 44:11.130
Your chief was murdered
by the Seventh Kavalry.

44:11.214 --> 44:13.756
I get it,
there's a history.

44:13.839 --> 44:15.130
But...

44:15.214 --> 44:18.172
you still have to consider
other possibilities, right?

44:18.714 --> 44:20.547
For instance, I was
at the crime scene earlier,

44:20.631 --> 44:22.339
and you know what I saw?
Tire tracks,

44:22.422 --> 44:24.255
right at the base
of the tree.

44:25.714 --> 44:26.964
What kind of vehicle?

44:27.047 --> 44:29.089
I'm sorry. Did I say vehicle?
No, no, no.

44:29.172 --> 44:31.881
No, um, it was a wheelchair.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.255
And I get how
you guys missed it.

44:36.339 --> 44:39.381
You know, he was your chief,
he was your friend.

44:39.464 --> 44:41.089
It's hard to do
your job well

44:41.172 --> 44:42.964
when you're that close
to someone.

44:43.047 --> 44:44.881
That's why I'm here.

44:44.964 --> 44:46.172
Hey, did you know
that he had

44:46.255 --> 44:48.839
a secret compartment
in his closet?

44:48.923 --> 44:51.506
-What?
-Yeah, I was over there
talking to his wife,

44:51.589 --> 44:54.089
and while I was there
I found this secret
fucking compartment.

44:54.172 --> 44:55.673
Isn't that insane?

44:55.756 --> 44:57.297
Why were you looking
in his closet?

44:57.381 --> 45:00.172
Oh. Well, when my dad
was murdered,

45:00.255 --> 45:03.506
they found a secret
compartment in his closet.

45:03.589 --> 45:05.047
So, you know...

45:05.923 --> 45:07.214
I always check.

45:07.881 --> 45:10.047
Once in a while, it pans out.

45:13.673 --> 45:15.547
What was in it?

45:17.756 --> 45:20.464
You tell me.
What was in it?

45:21.631 --> 45:23.756
How the fuck
should I know?

45:23.839 --> 45:25.047
Well...

45:25.130 --> 45:27.506
his wife told me
that you were the only person

45:27.589 --> 45:29.339
in that bedroom
since he died.

45:30.422 --> 45:33.923
And frankly, Angela...
(chuckles)

45:34.589 --> 45:37.464
you just don't strike me
as the fainting type.

45:42.214 --> 45:44.631
Okay, I'll tell you.

45:45.464 --> 45:48.297
It was a bust,
just a big, naked bust.

45:48.381 --> 45:50.506
That's it.
However...

45:51.255 --> 45:52.756
I think there was
something on that bust.

45:52.839 --> 45:55.214
I don't know.
Maybe your pal Judd asked you

45:55.297 --> 45:56.923
to get rid of it
if something ever happened,

45:57.005 --> 45:59.255
or, you know, maybe the two
of you were having an affair,

45:59.339 --> 46:02.881
which makes no sense because
your husband's fucking hot.

46:03.756 --> 46:06.798
But whatever it is,
this much I know--

46:09.005 --> 46:10.923
Men who end up
hanging from trees

46:11.005 --> 46:13.422
with secret compartments
in their closets

46:13.506 --> 46:16.005
tend to think of themselves
as good guys.

46:17.172 --> 46:21.839
And those who protect them
think they're good guys too.

46:22.756 --> 46:25.714
But here's the thing
about me, "Sister Night"...

46:28.172 --> 46:30.506
I eat good guys for breakfast.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.631
Ooh!

47:06.339 --> 47:08.839
Blake:
And so, it's been a long day
at the pearly gates.

47:08.923 --> 47:11.297
All the heroes have
gone to Hell.

47:11.381 --> 47:15.047
His work done,
God's packing up to go home.

47:15.130 --> 47:17.506
And then he notices
someone waiting.

47:18.964 --> 47:22.214
But it's not a hero.
It's just a woman.

47:22.297 --> 47:25.005
"Where did you come from?"
asks God.

47:25.089 --> 47:28.631
"Oh, I was standing
behind those other guys
the whole time.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.464
You just didn't see me."

47:34.547 --> 47:37.589
"Did I give you a talent?"
God asks.

47:38.673 --> 47:40.714
-"Nope."
-(knocking)

47:40.798 --> 47:43.214
"None to speak of,"
says the woman.

47:45.714 --> 47:48.297
God gives her a good long look.

47:52.047 --> 47:57.172
"I'm so sorry.
I'm embarrassed.

47:57.255 --> 48:01.923
"Seriously, this almost
never happens, but...

48:03.047 --> 48:05.130
I don't know who you are."

48:06.297 --> 48:11.005
And the woman looks at God
and she quietly says:

48:16.005 --> 48:19.297
"I'm the little girl who threw
the brick in the air."

48:23.172 --> 48:27.047
Then a sound from above,
something falling.

48:27.130 --> 48:28.923
The brick.

48:29.005 --> 48:33.547
God looks up, but it's too late.
He never saw it coming.

48:33.631 --> 48:37.464
It hits him so hard,
his brains shoot out his nose.

48:38.506 --> 48:41.589
Game over.
He's dead.

48:43.589 --> 48:46.464
And where does God go
when he dies?

48:47.089 --> 48:49.047
He goes to Hell.

48:50.923 --> 48:52.798
Roll on snare drum.

48:53.756 --> 48:55.214

48:57.923 --> 49:00.089

I don't know why I keep coming
to these stupid phone booths

49:13.673 --> 49:15.673
and telling you jokes.

49:17.798 --> 49:20.464
It's not like you ever had
a sense of humor.

49:23.297 --> 49:26.172
You're never gonna hear
this anyway probably.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.589
but sometimes it's,
you know, it's nice to...

49:34.005 --> 49:36.172
sometimes it's nice to pretend.

49:38.547 --> 49:41.547

still think you give a shit.
