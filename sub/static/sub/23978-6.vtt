01:50.318 --> 01:51.318
Oh, shit.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.694
Love isn't for the weak-hearted.

03:16.779 --> 03:17.989
It's for idiots.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.200
And murderers, apparently.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.958
A wedding ring?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.651
So the creep and the maniac
have found happiness together.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.494
Guess there's someone for everyone.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.458
Almost everyone.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.889
Shit. I'm sorry.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.058
Music too loud?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.685
Yeah.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.561
I didn't realize how late it was.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.145
I'll turn it down.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.150
Everything okay?

04:37.860 --> 04:38.861
Where's Vido?

04:40.029 --> 04:41.030
With his mom.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.659
Got anything to drink?

04:45.743 --> 04:46.744
Come in.

04:51.874 --> 04:52.874
So...

04:54.419 --> 04:56.087
this is where the magic happens.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.089
I'm just throwing paint around.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.551
It's what I do when I have a shitty day.
Calms me down.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.137
My methods are a little more direct.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.939
So, why the shitty day?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.024
My ex.

05:17.608 --> 05:21.404
- Using my kid against me.
- Well, there's a saying in my business.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.741
"Where there's an ex,
there's always a why."

05:26.075 --> 05:28.661
- I'm not one of your clients.
- You're right.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.997
It's none of my business.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.168
Well...

05:36.002 --> 05:37.211
I wasn't a good husband.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.131
We were too young.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.383
- I fooled around on her.
- You don't have to tell me.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.093
It was a long time ago.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.597
It's got nothing to do
with the kind of father I am today.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.016
Okay.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.645
Just trying to start again here.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.735
Yeah.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.695
Thanks for the booze.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.826
What about you?

06:11.370 --> 06:12.413
What about me?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.042
Why are you really here, Jessica?

06:18.169 --> 06:20.463
I was too lazy
to walk to the liquor store.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.091
Is that it?

06:27.887 --> 06:29.347
I don't want to be alone.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.256
Oh! Shit... Sorry.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.289
Looks better now.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.059
Nice.

09:06.796 --> 09:10.216
Hey, pervert! You just touched me.
Yeah, you in the hat.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.095
What are you talking about?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.944
You're welcome.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.580
Morning.

09:42.456 --> 09:45.459
- How long have you been up?
- Just a few hours.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.546
What, are you watching me sleep?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.185
It's not finished.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.360
I gotta go.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.904
Work.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.000
Morning.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.922
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I just said good morning.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.093
It doesn't take a PI
or even a PI's associate

10:36.177 --> 10:37.887
to recognize a walk of shame.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.410
You left your phone here last night,

10:39.472 --> 10:42.892
you've got serious bedhead going on,
and you're covered in paint.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.186
Banging the super, huh?

10:45.269 --> 10:48.397
How about you use some of those skills
I've taught you to do something useful?

10:49.523 --> 10:50.691
How about this?

10:52.026 --> 10:55.112
You thought that this ring
was a wedding band, didn't you?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.991
It's not. It's a university class ring.
I recognized it.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.994
From the university you got kicked out of.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.581
They put me on academic probation.
So, technically, I dropped out.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.958
So how many Dr. Karls,
specializing in genetics,

11:08.042 --> 11:10.461
could have gone there
between the late '70s and the '80s?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.505
Can't be that long of a list.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.510
Teaching moment, Malcolm.
You don't wait for permission.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.471
Well, me going back there is just...
It's not the best idea.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.807
- Why is that?
- People know me there.

11:22.890 --> 11:23.891
So?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.937
It didn't exactly end well.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.731
Your past always catches up with you.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.901
Might as well rip the Band-Aid off now.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.338
Hey. You're back.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.759
Glad to see you're enjoying
my gold-leaf truffles from Switzerland.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.055
Ah. That's why they taste
like rusty nails.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.642
Says the homeless woman who asked
for a $100 T-shirt with holes in it.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.894
It's distressed.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.025
You get my conditioner? My sports bra?

12:21.365 --> 12:25.703
IGH. Everything you know. Now.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.626
I only worked there
a couple days before that...

12:33.794 --> 12:36.797
crazy lady, whatever the hell she is,
attacked me.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.926
Luanne, the other nurse,
she was the only one I dealt with.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.846
I didn't even know the doctors' names.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.233
Tell me about the experiments.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.779
Luanne said they were developing
a new technique...

13:01.572 --> 13:03.491
to speed up the healing process.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.868
It was supposed to change the world.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.454
That's why it all had to be
so top secret or whatever.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.583
They were doing some illegal,
dangerous shit, and they knew it.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.210
What was the technique?

13:14.710 --> 13:18.088
Was it the same for everybody?
Was it one session? A series?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.257
I was just a nurse.
Nobody told me anything.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.719
- So you don't even know if it worked?
- IGH didn't help anybody.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.639
Not that I saw.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.433
All they did was create that monster.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.313
Why are you so interested
in all this, anyway?

13:34.396 --> 13:38.067
It's for a client.
Details of her case are privileged.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.196
So, how do I look?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.823
Like a waste of my time.

13:57.836 --> 13:58.837
Hey.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.048
Hey.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.262
- That bad, huh?
- Give me a break. My life just blew up.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.389
So I read.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.642
Yeah. It's, uh, it's everywhere.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.643
And they're right.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.689
I'm an asshole, and he's a great guy.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.607
That guy sucked up
all the air in the room,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.276
and there was no space left for you.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.736
It was the right move.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.282
And if you want to yell
or hug it out, I'm here.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.868
Can we just focus on something else
for a couple hours?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.245
Fine by me.
I can repress feelings all day.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.044
What do you want?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.088
So much for customer service.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.049
I saw you yesterday. On my cameras.
I don't want any trouble.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.801
Then you might wanna put that thing away.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.595
Like she said.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.723
What the hell is that?
Put that away.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.646
- It's preventative.
- So is mine.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.393
This is how idiots get shot.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.437
Take a breath.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.191
Listen...

15:03.235 --> 15:05.779
I'm a private investigator. Jessica Jones.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.534
You heard about what happened yesterday
at the aquarium?

15:11.410 --> 15:12.870
I was closed yesterday.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.082
But you saw something, didn't you?
On your security cameras?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.961
Look, fish were hurt,
people were terrorized.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.172
We just wanna find the people responsible.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.758
I can't get involved.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.093
Are those D-flawless?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.178
How much?

15:29.970 --> 15:31.347
Now you're trying to bribe me?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.349
I thought you were trying
to catch the criminal?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.559
We are. And we will.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.478
With your help.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.315
I want to be a good citizen.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.068
But you're not, are you? A citizen?

15:45.444 --> 15:48.697
Don't worry. We're not gonna call ICE.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.659
I've been robbed six times.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.078
I hang more cameras.
I buy a gun to scare them away.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.957
But if I call the police, my whole family
gets deported. Do you understand?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.584
A rock and a hard place?
Yeah, I been there.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.421
Okay. I'll show you.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.132
Not just fish were hurt.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.345
I've watched it over and over,
but I couldn't do anything about it.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.603
- No rear plate.
- No, but watch.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.233
Here.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.319
The man and the woman are arguing.
She's very upset.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.661
Dude has to drug her
to get her into the car?

16:37.496 --> 16:40.916
- Where's the romance?
- A man that would do this to a woman?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.543
Bet he's a citizen.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.088
You don't think he's controlling her,
do you?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.385
A powered woman used as a weapon?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.138
Déjà vu sucks ass.

17:17.618 --> 17:18.619
Nichelle!

17:20.830 --> 17:21.832
Mal?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.626
Hey. It's been a while.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.005
Hey. What are you doing here?

17:28.088 --> 17:31.008
I was just on campus. Thought I'd say hi.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.510
You must almost be done, right?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.594
Yeah.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.139
Three more months till my master's.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.016
Congratulations.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.018
You look different.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.603
Better.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.398
I'm clean. For a while now.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.650
Been working with a PI.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.904
It's not social work, but, I mean,
I'm still helping people.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.826
- I tried to call a while back...
- Yeah. The forgiveness step.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.496
I got your voice mail.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.290
You know, I gotta give it to you.
You were thorough.

18:03.373 --> 18:04.583
Just owning up to my shit.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.295
- Have a nice life, Malcolm.
- Niche, please.

18:08.378 --> 18:12.382
- I didn't have control of myself...
- Yeah. Some crazy man made you do drugs?

18:12.466 --> 18:15.219
Like you never partied before? Please.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.220
You're right.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.973
I was an addict waiting to happen,
and I fell right down that rabbit hole.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.934
I was just lost.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.353
You were in one
of the best schools in the country.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.355
Full ride. Pride of your family.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.274
I was just going through the motions.

18:29.358 --> 18:33.195
Well, I'm glad you got hooked on drugs
to find out who you really are.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.446
I'm sorry, Niche.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.824
For everything.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.201
I mean, you were...

18:40.285 --> 18:43.705
You just are
the best person that I know.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.834
I never thought I was good enough for you.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.336
That's the truth.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.464
Okay.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.051
Yeah?

19:05.185 --> 19:06.520
Take care of yourself.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.522
Yeah. You, too.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.585
I am done
babysitting your homeless woman.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.672
She is filthy. She's a slob.
She's manipulative.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.549
You're calling someone manipulative?

19:35.632 --> 19:37.092
Mmm. Why is this so delicious?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.554
I'm not playing, Jessica.
I want her out of my apartment.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.681
Wait. Your apartment?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.100
What happened to putting Inez
in a safe house?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.312
Our safe houses
are for clients of the firm.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.191
My partners are circling like vultures.
I have to be careful.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.235
- Unless you found me some leverage.
- Yeah. I'm close.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.365
Benowitz's chocolate bars.
Do you know who they're for?

20:00.449 --> 20:02.868
I think your partner is
definitely hiding something.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.745
It might not be a who. It might be a what.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.122
Okay. Explain.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.291
Just hold on to Inez for a few more days.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.959
I'll give you till tomorrow.

20:11.043 --> 20:15.505
I don't give a rat's ass if that woman
lives out of a cardboard box.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.633
I can't do it anymore.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.524
Karl Malus. Class of 1978.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
That looks more like a cast member
from Hair than a scientist.

21:19.027 --> 21:20.028
Are you sure that's him?

21:21.613 --> 21:22.656
It's him.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.372
I found some credit cards,
but it didn't tell me much.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.999
Maybe they'll speak to me.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.170
Hey.

21:37.254 --> 21:41.008
You've just got some sauce on your jacket.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.178
Uh, sorry. Would you...

21:47.389 --> 21:49.725
I heard about Griffin.
You holding up okay?

21:50.475 --> 21:52.894
Uh, I'm a mess. Clearly.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.440
I'm so sorry.
If there's anything that I can do, just...

21:56.523 --> 22:00.360
You know, Malcolm, um...
you're doing a really good job.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.948
The private investigator thing suits you.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.701
Thanks. I'm still learning, but...

22:07.784 --> 22:10.787
I'm sure Jessica would tell you
she appreciates you if she wasn't...

22:11.455 --> 22:13.290
you know... Jessica.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.666
Punch out, Malcolm.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.377
- I don't pay overtime.
- No, I'd rather stay and...

22:17.461 --> 22:18.461
Go.

22:20.964 --> 22:21.965
Thanks.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.220
Piece of shit.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.682
Don't encourage him.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.645
Encouraging people increases productivity,
and it strengthens loyalty.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.523
You might want to try it sometime,
before he quits on you.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.943
You might want to stop leading him on,
before you break his bleeding heart.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.107
What are you talking about?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.154
He has a thing for you.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.824
Malcolm does not have a thing.
That's ridiculous.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.618
Have you ever heard of Ambyhose?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.787
The pantyhose? I...

22:52.788 --> 22:54.581
What does that have to do with Dr. Karl?

22:54.664 --> 22:57.709
There's no home or business address
listed for Dr. Karl.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.337
But there's all these credit cards
and car payments

23:00.420 --> 23:02.547
dated back ten years,
and they are all billed to...

23:02.631 --> 23:05.550
- Ambyhose Hosiery Inc.
- Run by this guy.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.719
Justis Ambrose.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.932
Hosiery heir and also alum
of Karl's alma mater.

23:12.015 --> 23:15.060
Why is a hosiery company paying
for Dr. Karl's expenses?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.020
Let's find out.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.198
Yeah, this is the car service company.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.867
I'm trying to schedule
a drop-off for my client,

23:30.951 --> 23:32.744
but the dude forgot his tee time.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.038
Great.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.041
Client's name is Justis Ambrose.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.711
What do you mean, he's already there?
Since when?

23:41.795 --> 23:44.339
Well,
the dickhead forgot to cancel.

23:44.422 --> 23:45.422
Great.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.219
How did you know
he was gonna be at the club?

23:49.302 --> 23:50.137
It's Sunday.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.306
What else do rich assholes
with private golf club memberships do?

23:53.723 --> 23:55.267
Let's go hit some balls.

24:02.315 --> 24:05.902
- Gentlemen, good seeing you.
- All right, guys. Thank you.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.530
I'm so sorry, ladies. It's members only.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.574
Don't you know who this is?

24:10.657 --> 24:13.535
I do know who Ms. Walker is.
Unfortunately, she's also not a member.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.912
Okay, then I would like
to purchase a membership.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.455
We're not accepting any new members.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.833
Would you mind stepping out
of the way, please? Thank you.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.921
Membership isn't the issue. It's men only.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.692
- That's discrimination.
- This is a private club.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.051
You're on private property.
Please step away from the door,

24:30.135 --> 24:32.179
or I'll have security escort you
off the premises.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.263
This is bullshit.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.432
Who wants to be part
of this circle jerk anyway?

24:37.434 --> 24:38.560
I'm going in.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.271
They'll see you.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.692
- I'll distract them.
- With what?

24:45.775 --> 24:46.776
It's Patsy!

24:51.489 --> 24:54.492
Wipe that stupid smile off your face.
Do you think this is funny?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.244
You're about to be so fired.

24:56.786 --> 25:01.208
You have no idea who you're dealing with.
So go and get your supervisor right now.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.347
- Oh, boy. What's she doing here?
- Look at that.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.064
Hey! Hold up, ma'am.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.071
Hey, I'm just here
to have a conversation.

25:38.578 --> 25:39.663
Mr. Ambrose!

25:40.247 --> 25:42.707
- What do you want?
- Just to talk.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.919
About a friend of ours. Dr. Karl Malus.

25:46.628 --> 25:47.754
We need backup.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.215
No, she's with me. It's okay. Leave us.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.803
I'm taking a mulligan on that putt,
by the way.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.264
I don't care what that means.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.267
You must be one of the ones he saved.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.560
It's extraordinary.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.107
You're flawless.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.902
You've been paying all of Karl's expenses
for the last decade.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.448
- I want to know why and where he is.
- Mmm.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.294
See? Without any distractions...

26:27.377 --> 26:29.879
Whatever he did to me,
whoever else he messed with,

26:29.963 --> 26:31.923
I'm not gonna stop until I find out.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.383
You want to know what he did?

26:35.552 --> 26:36.678
Let me show you.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.100
This is my son, Eric.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.938
He was born
with severe craniofacial dysostosis,

26:47.022 --> 26:48.064
a genetic disorder.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.734
He wasn't expected to live past age five.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.403
I met Karl at university.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.156
He had made
some incredible breakthroughs,

26:56.239 --> 26:59.451
but his techniques
were years away from being approved.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.911
Eric didn't have that kind of time.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.081
So you paid Karl
to experiment on your son?

27:05.165 --> 27:07.083
I would have given him every penny I had.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.670
Karl risked his entire career
to save my boy.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.885
This is my son now.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.016
Last time I checked,
women still had equal rights.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.685
- On paper at least.
- Ma'am, please lower your voice.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.355
"Ma'am"?
What century do you think this is?

27:28.438 --> 27:32.359
You think you can stop us from having
a drink at your fancy little boys' club?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.030
Appears you've had plenty
to drink already.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.865
I am completely sober.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.788
If you refuse to leave,
I will call the police.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.494
Fine. And I will call the media,

27:42.577 --> 27:45.455
and I will tell them
about your sexist policies...

27:48.500 --> 27:50.251
God, I really... I don't feel well.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.837
Oh, jeez!

27:52.921 --> 27:54.923
- Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
- Fine.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.178
I used to watch her show.

28:00.762 --> 28:01.762
Sad.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.736
A little help?

28:17.278 --> 28:19.823
So, your son, is he gifted?

28:19.906 --> 28:22.367
He's gifted
at playing video games

28:22.450 --> 28:24.202
and running up my credit card bill.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.287
But, no, he's not like you.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.665
Too bad, considering
you funded the whole thing.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.792
No, I don't have that kind of money.

28:31.376 --> 28:36.172
Spray tanning and open-toed shoes,
they've killed the hosiery market.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.633
So just all of Karl's personal expenses.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.135
It's the least I can do.

28:42.303 --> 28:46.850
What if I told you that he was using
one of his patients to murder people?

28:46.933 --> 28:49.185
I'd say you don't know
what you're talking about.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.105
Karl's dedicated his life
to saving others.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.066
Now he's burying anything
that could expose him.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.944
I'm guessing, after this conversation,
you could be next

28:58.027 --> 28:59.779
unless you tell me where to find him.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.907
You're wrong.
And I won't do anything to hurt him.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.869
If you're gonna use
that strength on me, do it.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.913
Until then, I'm gonna play through.

29:13.793 --> 29:14.878
Oops.

29:18.673 --> 29:21.050
Thanks for letting me know, Justis.
You're a good friend.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.182
Of course it's not true.

29:27.807 --> 29:28.808
You know me.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.227
She sounds nuts.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.149
I'm sorry she freaked you out.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.320
I'll definitely look into it.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.991
You too, man. Good night.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.246
It's all right. It's all right.

30:32.705 --> 30:34.666
It's over.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.418
You're all right.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.383
I got a call.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.053
Jessica's coming.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.932
I think it's time.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.484
Come on.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.241
I should have taken you to the ER.

31:10.535 --> 31:13.288
Food poisoning. Stupid burrito.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.585
You would tell me
if there was more to it, right?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.169
Jess...

31:23.590 --> 31:24.883
I'm just a mess...

31:26.384 --> 31:28.094
with this Griffin stuff. And...

31:28.511 --> 31:33.641
I just need to sleep.
And I need some Pepto and a bucket.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.526
I'm gonna stick around and play nurse,
so don't puke on me.

31:45.528 --> 31:50.575
Look, I appreciate your concern
and your delicate bedside manner, but...

31:53.077 --> 31:54.077
I just want to cry.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.705
So cry.

31:55.788 --> 31:59.751
You hate criers.
And I'd rather not have an audience.

31:59.834 --> 32:04.172
All right. I'll...
I'm gonna check in on you later.

32:04.255 --> 32:07.425
Don't. I'll be asleep.
Just stay on Karl's trail.

32:12.597 --> 32:16.684
Just stay in bed, okay?
And don't do anything stupid.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.966
It has to be here somewhere.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.631
"Knock, knock." "Come in."
That's how it usually works.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.552
That's my Birkin bag.

33:40.935 --> 33:45.189
You trashy little skank.
After everything that I've done.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.858
I know what this is prescribed for.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.236
That is none of your business.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.404
Actually, it is.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.825
'Cause that's why I'm here, isn't it?

33:57.326 --> 33:58.995
In your fancy-schmancy apartment?

33:59.537 --> 34:02.498
Why you're asking me
all those questions about IGH?

34:02.582 --> 34:03.958
Because you have ALS.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.043
So?

34:06.085 --> 34:09.505
You want to join the Ice Bucket Challenge?
Throw me a fund-raiser?

34:10.757 --> 34:11.799
Get the hell out.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.385
I get it.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.054
I've had to be a fighter, too.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.558
No other way to survive
the shit I've been through.

34:22.851 --> 34:24.187
But you reminded me...

34:25.103 --> 34:26.938
I used to care about people.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.568
- I used to be a nurse.
- I don't need a goddamn nurse.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.862
I need you to get out
of my goddamn apartment.

34:35.156 --> 34:40.703
I wasn't sure what you were after, so I...
I didn't tell you everything earlier.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.623
About IGH?

34:45.666 --> 34:47.376
There was another patient there.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.170
A boy.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.380
He had powers, too.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.715
Like Jessica's?

34:55.384 --> 34:57.094
He could heal people.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.473
What does that mean?

35:00.556 --> 35:02.183
With his hands.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.562
It didn't work all the time, and...

35:07.438 --> 35:09.398
it made him sick to do it, but...

35:10.525 --> 35:13.528
but after I was attacked,
they brought him to me.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.907
He healed you?

35:19.575 --> 35:22.036
I wouldn't be able to walk
if it wasn't for him.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.120
Hi.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.080
Hey.
Sorry you're not feeling well.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.957
I'm okay. Come in.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.505
Oh, um...

36:56.589 --> 36:58.382
It, uh, it fell out of your pocket.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.263
Allergies.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.391
That's why my eyes are so red.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.436
I think I know what you're going through.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.232
- You do?
- I ran into my ex today.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.234
Oh, yeah?

37:16.317 --> 37:18.986
It was a flashback
to this, like, whole other life

37:19.070 --> 37:21.030
and how we were together and...

37:21.864 --> 37:24.408
- Sounds intense.
- I thought she was it.

37:25.034 --> 37:27.662
I'm still kicking myself
for screwing it up, but...

37:28.621 --> 37:30.039
I realized something today.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.667
Malcolm, would you just hold that thought?

37:32.750 --> 37:34.043
Yeah.

38:04.991 --> 38:05.992
You were saying?

38:06.075 --> 38:08.369
No, you're sick,
and I was talking your ear off.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.787
I'm just gonna go.

38:09.870 --> 38:10.871
I'm fine.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.374
Really.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.001
Okay. Uh...

38:15.710 --> 38:19.588
I was just saying that we have this idea
of who we're supposed to be, but...

38:20.589 --> 38:23.884
maybe we gotta blow that up just
to find out who we really are.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.137
Uh...

38:27.138 --> 38:30.850
You should get some rest.
I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna take off.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.059
Malcolm, wait.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.109
Are you okay?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.028
Yeah.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.071
Look at me.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.449
Look at me.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.250
I see you.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.399
Sick.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.067
Whatever, dude.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.903
No. I'm, like, not even down with that.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.364
Eric!

40:09.698 --> 40:11.534
- Do I know you?
- I'm friends with your dad.

40:12.368 --> 40:15.079
- You don't look like a friend of my dad's.
- We're golf buddies.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.082
- Hey. What are you doing?
- He'll call you back.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.167
Give me my goddamn phone... Yo!

40:21.001 --> 40:22.128
Get off me!

40:22.962 --> 40:25.840
You want your phone back in one piece?
Then you'll shut up and smile.

40:28.175 --> 40:31.929
Hey, buddy! Look who I ran into.
Small world, huh?

40:32.513 --> 40:33.973
Your son is so handsome.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.725
Just flawless.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.353
Ow! Dad, who is this lady?

40:39.437 --> 40:42.648
Let him go.
I'll tell you whatever you want.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.109
Help me find Karl,
and you'll never see me again.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.193
Either of you.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.617
The line keeps moving.

40:55.035 --> 40:58.038
And I keep stepping over it.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.879
How far is too far?

41:08.299 --> 41:10.301
And will there ever be a way back?

46:28.911 --> 46:29.995
Jessica.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.960
I don't understand.

46:41.882 --> 46:42.883
It's me.

46:53.602 --> 46:54.603
Mom?

46:55.305 --> 47:01.583
