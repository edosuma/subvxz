Mr. Mitchell?

02:16.050 --> 02:17.969
Yeah. What do you want?

02:18.052 --> 02:20.722
We spoke on the phone several times.

02:20.847 --> 02:22.515
I'm Dr. Turner.

02:24.517 --> 02:28.897
Yeah.
Well... nothing's changed.

02:28.980 --> 02:30.648
I'm very sorry to hear that.

02:33.735 --> 02:35.153
That's it, then.

02:35.236 --> 02:36.404
It doesn't have to be this way.

02:39.824 --> 02:41.409
Your wife is suffering.

02:44.495 --> 02:47.665
It's within your power to stop that.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.002
You're not coming in.

02:51.085 --> 02:52.837
Do it yourself, then.

02:52.921 --> 02:54.005
-Any of you.
-I told you before--

02:54.088 --> 02:55.423
I've included instructions
on how to operate it.

02:55.506 --> 02:56.841
We're not interested.

02:56.925 --> 02:59.593
-What about the rest of your family?
-They're not either.

02:59.677 --> 03:01.930
We're talking about your wife here,
Mr. Mitchell.

03:02.013 --> 03:04.057
-How can you not be interested?

03:05.850 --> 03:08.602

-Yep.

08:51.695 --> 08:54.031
[stutters] Why'd he give it to you, Pop?

08:54.115 --> 08:58.035
Said we could do it ourselves,
any one of us.

08:58.119 --> 09:00.454
What about Brad and Travis?

09:00.579 --> 09:03.541
What about them?
They want their cut, too.

09:05.918 --> 09:08.254
You really wanna have
that conversation now?

09:10.423 --> 09:11.465
No.

09:14.468 --> 09:16.053
Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.721
Use your fucking head,
Ronnie, will you?

09:17.805 --> 09:19.223
Hey, I am using my fucking head.

09:19.307 --> 09:22.226
-What's the matter with you--
-No, no!

09:22.310 --> 09:23.602
You're not.

09:35.489 --> 09:36.615
[sniffles]

09:38.742 --> 09:39.993
[sighs]

09:43.997 --> 09:48.919
Your mother got a lot of money
when Travis and Brad's father died.

09:49.002 --> 09:50.003
A lot.

09:50.128 --> 09:51.172
Yeah, Pop.
We know.

09:51.297 --> 09:53.174
-That's why we're here with--
-Shut up.

09:53.299 --> 09:55.759
Shut up.

09:57.511 --> 10:02.266
Now, that money has been locked up
in a separate account for years.

10:02.350 --> 10:03.684
And I made it

10:03.809 --> 10:07.355
so that when she passes,
that money goes to me.

10:09.022 --> 10:10.441
That means...

10:12.443 --> 10:17.030
that when my time comes, by law,
that money will all go to you two.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.492
[Ronnie] What are you...
[grunts]

10:22.328 --> 10:23.704
[chuckles]

10:23.787 --> 10:26.374
[stutters] Yeah, I don't know what you...

10:26.457 --> 10:29.210
Fuck. What are you talking about, Pop?

10:29.335 --> 10:32.296
-"When your time comes"?
-Yeah, that's right.

10:32.380 --> 10:35.299
Not to that degenerate outside,
not to his asshole brother.

10:36.384 --> 10:41.054
But if you keep running your mouth
about inheritances and whatever else,

10:41.138 --> 10:44.225
they might just change their minds
about all this.

10:44.350 --> 10:47.060
And if that's what ends up happening...

10:47.185 --> 10:51.189
well, I hope you know a good lawyer.

10:58.239 --> 11:00.073
-[T.J.] You think it still runs?
-[Ronnie sighs]

11:00.157 --> 11:01.325
[sniffles] Don't know.

11:08.416 --> 11:10.334
I'd take it with me
if I had time to ride it,

11:10.418 --> 11:12.169
but I'm busy working all the goddamn time.

11:12.252 --> 11:14.505
[T.J.] Then maybe you should sell it.
[clears throat]

11:14.588 --> 11:16.924
Hopefully, after all this,
I won't have to.

11:17.049 --> 11:18.091
-Now...
-Well, then don't.

11:18.175 --> 11:21.011
-...can you settle?
-I'm settled. What do you...

11:21.094 --> 11:22.930
-Stop fiddling with everything in this...
-I'm not...

11:30.604 --> 11:31.855
[Ronnie] Hey.

11:31.939 --> 11:33.190
Hey.

11:38.111 --> 11:39.780
[Ronnie] When'd you get out?

11:39.905 --> 11:42.282
[sighs] Couple weeks ago.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.578
What was it this time?
B and E?

11:47.037 --> 11:48.372
-Assault.
-Hmm.

11:49.457 --> 11:50.874
[Ronnie scoffing]

11:53.419 --> 11:54.920
You okay?

11:57.255 --> 11:59.633
I don't know, T.J., are you?

12:01.760 --> 12:03.762
What are you doing for work?

12:05.389 --> 12:06.890
Things.

12:06.974 --> 12:09.393
[Ronnie] Oh, yeah?
What kind of things?

12:09.477 --> 12:10.978
[Travis sighs]

12:11.061 --> 12:13.063
What do you care, Ronnie?

12:13.146 --> 12:15.232
Well, me and T.J. just talked to Dad.

12:15.315 --> 12:16.650
[Travis] Your dad, not mine.

12:18.569 --> 12:19.903
Whatever.

12:19.987 --> 12:22.406
He's holding all the cards, you know.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.658
-Especially yours.
-[T.J.] Ronnie.

12:24.783 --> 12:26.827
[Ronnie] No, no, he should...
he should hear this.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.121
He's, uh...

12:30.831 --> 12:33.792
He's... he's cutting you out.

12:36.128 --> 12:37.671
You and Brad.

12:37.755 --> 12:39.923
-[T.J.] What are you doing, Ronnie?
-Shut up.

12:41.592 --> 12:42.843
Shut up.

12:45.638 --> 12:47.431
Why are you telling me this, Ronnie?

12:47.515 --> 12:49.016
Because you're my brother.

12:51.685 --> 12:52.936
So, yeah.

12:55.022 --> 12:59.860
Those things you're doing...
hopefully they pay good.

13:07.701 --> 13:08.994
[sniffles]

13:54.748 --> 13:56.542
[cell phone buzzing]

14:00.879 --> 14:02.756
You can take that.

14:04.007 --> 14:06.218
It's just work.

14:09.597 --> 14:11.932
That part I don't miss.

14:12.015 --> 14:13.726
[Brad breathes deeply]

14:17.229 --> 14:20.941
[Melissa] I'm sorry to ask this, but...
we're gonna be okay after this, right?

14:25.779 --> 14:26.864
Yeah.

15:05.486 --> 15:06.987
[engine stops]

15:21.960 --> 15:24.004
[T.J. talking indistinctly]

15:26.006 --> 15:27.090
Yes.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.178
I hear you. Right.

15:31.303 --> 15:32.345
Okay, I...

15:35.683 --> 15:38.686
I'm telling you, I'll pay you next week.
[stuttering] I can...

15:42.105 --> 15:45.358
All right. Okay.
[stutters] I gotta go. Bye.

15:55.368 --> 15:56.787
This is Melissa.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.044
Hi.

16:04.169 --> 16:05.212
Hi.

16:06.547 --> 16:09.717
These are my brothers.
T.J., Ronnie.

16:09.842 --> 16:11.176
Half-brothers.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.225
Um, Brad's told me a lot
about both of you.

16:20.477 --> 16:22.479
He shouldn't have told you anything.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.196
[sighs] Who's this?

16:34.032 --> 16:35.367
She's a friend.

16:37.995 --> 16:39.747
Do you understand what's going on here?

16:41.248 --> 16:43.709
I'm just here to help Brad through this.

16:47.087 --> 16:49.590
This is none of your business.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.427
Where's, uh... where's Travis?

16:56.889 --> 16:58.932
[EKG beeping]

17:16.199 --> 17:18.117
[Grace whispers] Travis.

17:21.121 --> 17:23.080

17:57.658 --> 17:58.909
[Brad sniffles]

17:58.992 --> 18:00.327
[Travis clears throat]

18:01.995 --> 18:03.831
[Brad exhales heavily and sniffles]

18:03.914 --> 18:05.498
[footsteps receding]

18:11.338 --> 18:12.589
[sighs]

18:36.697 --> 18:38.365
[exhales heavily]

18:52.462 --> 18:53.797
[softly] Brad.

19:11.732 --> 19:13.400
This is Melissa.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.573
[groans]

19:30.125 --> 19:34.087
I found this up in the attic last week.

19:35.088 --> 19:36.882
It's your mother's old diary.

19:39.134 --> 19:43.180
But before we get to that,
let's get something else out of the way.

19:43.263 --> 19:45.808
Because I know you all saw the bag.

19:46.767 --> 19:51.146
You all know what's in it
and you all know what it will do.

19:52.898 --> 19:53.899
[sighs]

19:55.233 --> 19:56.819
But being able to do it ourselves

19:56.944 --> 19:59.988
doesn't change a goddamn thing
and that's that.

20:09.790 --> 20:12.793
"June 10th, 1982.

20:13.836 --> 20:17.464
I'm trying to move on, day by day.

20:17.589 --> 20:22.385
The church has been so supportive,
but I'm still struggling.

20:22.469 --> 20:27.349
I know it's horrible to say,
but Bradley's death was like a gift.

20:27.474 --> 20:30.477
I certainly prayed for an accident
like that enough times.

20:32.354 --> 20:34.898
And now, as I'm struggling to move on,

20:34.982 --> 20:38.651
I'm being told that I have to decide
what to do with his remains.

20:45.492 --> 20:48.036
Whenever my time comes,

20:48.161 --> 20:51.748
and that decision has to be made for me,

20:51.832 --> 20:56.044
I can only hope it's made
by someone who cares about me.

20:57.629 --> 21:00.507
And not by someone
who's glad I'm dead."

21:02.175 --> 21:03.718
So...

21:03.844 --> 21:07.514
we should discuss her arrangements
for once this is over.

21:08.723 --> 21:10.851
Well, I'm not ready to think
that far ahead yet.

21:14.855 --> 21:16.148
The hell does that mean?

21:19.401 --> 21:22.404
Okay, I don't know
what you two are trying to pull...

21:22.529 --> 21:24.072
but whatever it is,
it ain't gonna work.

21:24.197 --> 21:25.698
No one's trying to pull anything, Ronnie.

21:25.823 --> 21:27.325
Maybe he just cares about his mother.

21:27.409 --> 21:29.577
Well, maybe you should shut up
and mind your fucking business.

21:29.702 --> 21:31.121
How about you fucking try that
for a fucking change.

21:31.204 --> 21:32.622
[Brad] Shut up, Ronnie!
[Melissa] Hey, hey, hey!

21:32.705 --> 21:33.957
[T.J.] Ronnie, come on.
[Melissa] Get off of him!

21:34.041 --> 21:35.500
[George] Knock it off!
[Melissa] Hey! Hey, stop, stop!

21:35.583 --> 21:37.961
-Stop. Stop.
-[T.J.] All right, back up. Back up.

21:38.045 --> 21:39.504
Okay.

21:40.672 --> 21:42.090
This ain't gonna end good for you.

21:43.508 --> 21:45.052
You either.

21:46.011 --> 21:51.016
And you. You, whatever you think's
going on here, you're wrong.

22:19.419 --> 22:21.254
What are you doing?

22:21.379 --> 22:23.381
[Travis] Nothing, man.
Just looking around.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.219
I remember that.

22:28.971 --> 22:32.140
Mom and her religion.
Hocus-pocus bullshit.

22:37.104 --> 22:39.314
She always thought
I stole the missing piece.

22:42.275 --> 22:45.112
She never said it,
but I know she thought it.

22:46.071 --> 22:47.905
Man, you don't know that.

22:48.906 --> 22:50.242
Yeah, well, I wasn't you.

22:51.994 --> 22:52.995
[sighs]

22:54.787 --> 22:57.165
You made your own choices, Travis.

22:59.417 --> 23:03.296
Yeah. I know I did, Brad.
I still do.

23:04.839 --> 23:06.591
I accept who I am.

23:06.674 --> 23:08.093
What, and I don't?

23:08.176 --> 23:10.637
You say you're not ready
to think that far ahead yet?

23:10.762 --> 23:12.305
That's fine.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.642
I mean, it's bullshit.
But it's fine.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.685
But don't pretend
that actually makes you any better

23:17.810 --> 23:20.813
than the rest of us in all this.
It doesn't.

23:22.315 --> 23:23.691
It makes you worse.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.461
I'm gonna, uh, set the alarm for 7:15.

23:43.545 --> 23:44.879
Whatever you want.

23:45.004 --> 23:46.173
[clears throat]

24:00.353 --> 24:01.813
[Brad exhales heavily]

24:05.400 --> 24:09.654
I'm sorry about all that stuff earlier
by the fire.

24:16.578 --> 24:18.080
[Melissa] There's...

24:19.038 --> 24:21.208
there's something I need to ask you.

24:24.252 --> 24:25.587
[sniffles]

24:32.427 --> 24:34.262
What did Ronnie mean

24:34.387 --> 24:37.765
when he said that I don't know
what's really going on?

24:41.186 --> 24:44.647
[Brad] I'm sorry,
I should have told you this.

24:44.731 --> 24:46.065
[Melissa] So, tell me.

24:47.609 --> 24:48.735
[Brad] Her pain.

24:51.946 --> 24:56.576
My mother's pain...
there's a way to make it go away.

24:58.411 --> 25:01.623
[Melissa] Is that what's in the black bag?

25:01.748 --> 25:03.082
[Brad sighs]

25:03.208 --> 25:04.417
Yes.

25:06.794 --> 25:09.046
Then why wouldn't you? [chuckles]

25:16.763 --> 25:18.431
It's not that simple.

[Melissa]
But if the end result is the same,

25:24.604 --> 25:26.606
why would you let her suffer?

25:33.112 --> 25:34.281
Good night.

25:43.456 --> 25:45.333
[EKG beeping]

26:08.981 --> 26:13.027
[Ronnie] We should replace the truck, too.
Thing's a piece of shit.

26:13.152 --> 26:15.655
Oh, it's not the truck,
it's the economy.

26:24.163 --> 26:25.248
[Ronnie sighs]

26:25.332 --> 26:27.334
Okay, how'd it go at the bank?

26:29.669 --> 26:31.879
Not good. [clears throat]

26:33.840 --> 26:36.175
[Ronnie] Okay, what about the other place?
The credit union?

26:36.301 --> 26:37.969
Well, no.
That's not gonna happen there either.

26:38.052 --> 26:39.846
Nobody's giving out any loans.

26:43.641 --> 26:45.643

[T.J.] Oh, man.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.074
What?

27:01.743 --> 27:04.746
It's Mom's wedding photo.
From her church.

27:13.713 --> 27:15.882
I've never seen Brad Sr. before.

27:18.426 --> 27:20.094
Me neither.

27:20.219 --> 27:21.846
Did you know anything about him?

27:25.725 --> 27:28.520
Only that he used to
beat the shit outta Mom.

-I need you to put your shoes on.
-What's wrong?

29:51.371 --> 29:54.457
I don't know. Maybe nothing.
Just put your shoes on.

-That's why you woke me up?
-No, no, no. No.

30:22.402 --> 30:26.280
I think someone was in the house.
The side door was wide open.

-I don't know.

33:10.277 --> 33:12.529
-What do you mean you don't know?
-I mean I don't fucking know.

33:12.614 --> 33:14.406
They weren't in their beds.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.325
You think that they slashed the tires?
