WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:06.405
Those things
from purgatory. Leviathan.

00:06.579 --> 00:09.605
They're like Shapeshifters.
Only a lot more into eating folk.

00:09.782 --> 00:12.250
And they bleed black goo.

00:12.619 --> 00:14.587
I believe you know Sheriff Mills.

00:18.157 --> 00:20.853
- Dick freaking Roman.
- Who the hell is Dick Roman?

00:21.027 --> 00:23.291
I'm gonna eat you, Bob. Yes.

00:26.165 --> 00:28.326
Bobby, come on. Come on, come on.

00:29.602 --> 00:30.864
Go, go!

00:31.037 --> 00:32.868
Hey, Bobby, your hat.

00:33.039 --> 00:35.599
Oh, God, Bobby. Hold on.

00:36.009 --> 00:38.944
Did you come here to finish the job?
We're coming for you.

00:39.112 --> 00:41.478
And not just to hurt you. To kill you.

00:42.815 --> 00:46.216
Hey, Bobby, hey.
Thanks for everything.

00:46.819 --> 00:47.945
Idiots.

00:50.657 --> 00:51.681
Bobby? Hey.

01:03.836 --> 01:05.701
All right, let's do this. Move fast.

01:05.872 --> 01:07.897
Wait, wait, wait.
What's the plan, exactly?

01:08.074 --> 01:10.133
Don't die.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.946
He's heading downtown.

01:24.490 --> 01:27.391
Take the street, I'll take the alley.
Meet you in the middle.

01:36.469 --> 01:37.697
Son of a...

01:44.043 --> 01:45.408
Dean.

01:54.053 --> 01:55.111
Dean?

02:26.019 --> 02:28.419
Don't give me the dirty diaper look.
I ain't calling you.

02:34.027 --> 02:36.894
- Hello?
- Sam, it's Jody Mills. I wake you?

02:37.063 --> 02:38.394
<i>Sheriff. Uh...</i>

02:38.765 --> 02:40.665
Yeah. I mean...

02:40.833 --> 02:44.564
I got something that smells like you
boys. A body turned up in Canton, Ohio.

02:44.737 --> 02:47.228
Local P.D. Is trying to bury the story
and the body.

02:47.573 --> 02:48.665
Okay.

02:48.841 --> 02:51.833
- So, what's up with the body?
- Well, when it went missing...

02:52.045 --> 02:54.843
...it was a normal grad student
named Charles Durbin.

02:55.048 --> 02:58.176
When it turned up, the thing
was mummified, minus the wrapping.

02:58.351 --> 03:01.684
<i>This is the second body found like this
in the last couple of weeks.</i>

03:01.854 --> 03:03.412
Sound like a song you tap to?

03:03.589 --> 03:06.319
Well, yeah, yeah.
That's our kind of number.

03:06.659 --> 03:07.819
Hey, question.

03:07.994 --> 03:11.953
How does a sheriff in Sioux Falls
get wind of a case in Ohio?

03:12.131 --> 03:13.257
<i>I'm just that nosy.</i>

03:13.433 --> 03:16.163
After everything I've been through
with you boys and...

03:17.437 --> 03:18.699
And with Bobby.

03:18.871 --> 03:21.601
Something like this pops up on the wire,
catches my ear.

03:21.774 --> 03:23.799
<i>- What can I say?
- Well, we'll look into it.</i>

03:24.310 --> 03:25.834
<i>- Call me after, okay?
- Yeah.</i>

03:28.281 --> 03:30.374
Sheriff Mills, she caught us one.

03:31.284 --> 03:33.184
I feel bad, we didn't get her anything.

03:33.352 --> 03:37.186
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but
I hope you're watching cartoon smut.

03:37.356 --> 03:40.450
Because reading Dick Roman crap
over and over again...

03:40.626 --> 03:43.220
...is just self-punishment.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.661
It's called anime.

03:49.836 --> 03:50.860
And it's an art form.

03:59.979 --> 04:01.412
Well, this looks nice.

04:01.614 --> 04:03.309
Check around the back?

04:09.722 --> 04:15.661
Well, there's a semi-functioning
bathroom and one unrancid bedroom.

04:15.828 --> 04:17.055
Define semi-functioning...

04:17.230 --> 04:20.324
...and do not use the words
"hole in the floor."

04:37.850 --> 04:39.875
How does paper beat rock?

04:40.052 --> 04:41.781
It's stupid.

04:48.227 --> 04:50.286
Kids playing hide-and-seek
found the body.

04:50.463 --> 04:52.556
- Wow. Very King Tut.
- Yeah.

04:52.732 --> 04:56.395
So this is where the eyewitness
to the assault lives.

04:56.569 --> 04:59.766
- Cops are calling him unreliable witness.
- Because?

04:59.939 --> 05:01.236
Let's find out.

05:03.776 --> 05:06.802
Special Agent Smith.
This is Special Agent Smith.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.537
No relation.

05:08.714 --> 05:11.444
Whoa. Do you mind if we?

05:11.617 --> 05:13.949
My mom's sleeping in there.

05:17.123 --> 05:19.216
So how can l...?

05:19.392 --> 05:22.327
Yeah, we had questions
about the incident you witnessed...

05:22.495 --> 05:25.123
...in the alley?
You're gonna laugh at my story...

05:25.298 --> 05:28.495
...like the rest of the suits?
We're not gonna laugh at you.

05:32.271 --> 05:35.638
All right, well,
I'm on the steps, medicating...

05:35.808 --> 05:37.799
...when I hear fighting.

05:37.977 --> 05:41.413
So I look, there's my neighbor Durbin.

05:41.581 --> 05:44.311
And some dude dressed
like my grandpa...

05:44.483 --> 05:46.314
...has got him by the neck, right?

05:46.485 --> 05:48.453
What do you mean
looks like your grandpa?

05:48.921 --> 05:52.288
Uh... Snappy shoes, suit.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.154
One of those Justin Timberlake hats.

05:56.128 --> 05:58.619
- What, you mean a fedora?
- Aha.

05:58.798 --> 06:00.857
Did you see anything else?

06:01.601 --> 06:06.595
This red, like, energy...

06:06.772 --> 06:11.869
...passed through Durbin to Hat Guy.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.675
Even my watch stopped.

06:15.381 --> 06:16.473
Durbs...

06:17.650 --> 06:21.313
...he aged before my eyes.

06:21.487 --> 06:24.684
He looked like a raisin.

06:26.359 --> 06:27.519
Oh, we believe you.

06:29.762 --> 06:30.888
Thanks for your help.

06:31.530 --> 06:33.122
Thank you officer... Officers.

06:34.634 --> 06:36.033
Wow.

06:44.010 --> 06:45.534
Yeah. Ahem.

06:45.711 --> 06:48.339
Nothing that turns dudes
into a crypt keeper.

06:48.514 --> 06:50.038
You?

06:50.783 --> 06:52.410
Well, greater Canton...

06:52.585 --> 06:55.918
...turns out, kind of a hot spot
for weird dead bodies.

06:56.088 --> 06:58.716
- You don't say?
- Yeah. News archives.

06:58.891 --> 07:01.724
Not exactly reporting mummifies...

07:01.894 --> 07:06.831
...but still, 1928, three deaths,
cited as spontaneous combustion.

07:06.999 --> 07:09.593
Body is, quote,
"Shriveled despite no signs of fire."

07:09.802 --> 07:12.430
- A little stretch, but okay.
- '74, three bodies found...

07:12.605 --> 07:13.799
...with leathery decay.

07:14.407 --> 07:16.068
'57, three more.

07:16.242 --> 07:17.766
Severe dehydration.

07:17.944 --> 07:19.935
But this time,
one made the front page.

07:20.446 --> 07:23.745
Girl named Terry Cervantes
found a corpse near her church.

07:23.916 --> 07:27.079
- Any pattern other than the location?
- Random vics, random years.

07:27.253 --> 07:29.414
But they seem to drop in threes.

07:29.588 --> 07:32.056
That's two down, one to go.

07:32.224 --> 07:34.556
- Let me drive for a sec.
- You gonna...

07:34.727 --> 07:38.322
...look at more anime
or are you strictly into Dick now?

07:47.707 --> 07:49.868
- Hmm.
- Are those local feeds?

07:50.042 --> 07:52.340
- Yeah.
- How did you do that so fast?

07:52.945 --> 07:55.209
Little tutorial from Frank.

07:57.149 --> 08:00.084
Don't worry,
we'll pretend this never happened.

08:00.886 --> 08:07.052
<i>Now, mummy numero dos was found
at the Gas n' Sip near Main Street.</i>

08:07.226 --> 08:08.284
Yeah.

08:09.628 --> 08:12.756
All right. Well, here's all the cameras
around that store.

08:14.133 --> 08:15.930
You need to teach me that trick.

08:17.803 --> 08:20.636
Hey, check it out. Timberlake. Heh.

08:22.475 --> 08:24.306
Wait a sec.

08:24.910 --> 08:26.969
Can't let me bask in glory
for one second.

08:27.146 --> 08:29.671
Shut up. Look.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.246
He hasn't aged a day, has he?

08:36.655 --> 08:39.522
All right. Well, if he's been popping up
for decades now...

08:39.692 --> 08:41.784
...then somebody's bound to know
who he is.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.920
Is there any chance
that Terry is still local?

08:46.165 --> 08:49.828
It's so pretty in the spring.
Everything is blooming.

08:50.036 --> 08:53.472
That's why I walked home that way.
To see the flowers.

08:53.806 --> 08:56.104
Instead, I found that body.

08:56.275 --> 08:59.267
I still have no idea what could've
done that to that person.

08:59.445 --> 09:01.936
Do you recognize that man?

09:02.915 --> 09:03.973
Yeah.

09:04.950 --> 09:07.009
I mean,
he lived on my parents' street.

09:07.319 --> 09:08.513
Mr. Snider.

09:10.356 --> 09:12.790
Where'd you say your parents live?

09:19.465 --> 09:20.625
So, what is this thing?

09:20.800 --> 09:23.166
Some sort of vampire
who got too sucky?

09:23.335 --> 09:26.702
No. Coroner's reports said
there was blood in both bodies.

09:27.139 --> 09:29.539
Three-hundred-year-old blood,
but blood.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.318
Dude, dude. A fedora dude.

09:48.094 --> 09:50.028
All right, let's do this.
Let's move fast.

09:50.196 --> 09:51.720
Whoa. What's the plan here exactly?

09:52.264 --> 09:54.061
Don't die.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.848
He's heading downtown.

10:10.416 --> 10:13.351
Take the street, I'll take the alley.
Meet you in the middle.

10:23.863 --> 10:25.194
Son of a...

10:38.010 --> 10:39.443
Hey!

10:40.412 --> 10:41.879
Hey!

10:42.781 --> 10:44.373
Hey!

10:53.626 --> 10:54.718
Hey, you.

10:55.394 --> 10:57.259
Drop the gun.

10:57.630 --> 10:59.097
Put it down. Drop the gun.

10:59.798 --> 11:01.425
All right.

11:21.687 --> 11:23.985
- Okay, can I just...?
- Don't.

11:24.156 --> 11:26.124
- Listen to me.
- Hey, if you tell me...

11:26.292 --> 11:30.160
...you're from the Bureau one more time,
I'm gonna air you out myself. Got it?

11:38.604 --> 11:39.935
"No signal."

11:40.606 --> 11:43.336
- What are you, some kind of Jerry spy?
- Jerry who?

11:44.777 --> 11:46.472
And a terrible one at that.

11:46.645 --> 11:50.479
This badge was issued
68 years from now.

11:50.649 --> 11:53.174
Ace work, kraut-muncher.

11:58.490 --> 11:59.889
'44?

12:00.092 --> 12:01.719
I'm stuck in 1944?

12:02.695 --> 12:06.187
We're all stuck in 1944, you bunny.

12:20.512 --> 12:23.879
- Take a powder.
- Yes, sir.

12:27.653 --> 12:30.554
I don't even like frigging sauerkraut.
So just skip past...

12:30.723 --> 12:34.056
What happened in the alley?
And paint me a real picture.

12:34.426 --> 12:38.021
<i>All right, well, I'm Twelve-Monkeyed
no matter what I say, so here goes.</i>

12:38.330 --> 12:43.393
I was chasing this dude,
I just seen him mummify a guy.

12:43.769 --> 12:45.999
Yeah. So I jumped him...

12:46.171 --> 12:50.335
...he lights up red, poof,
we're in 1944.

13:00.452 --> 13:02.249
Tell me more about the red light.

13:04.089 --> 13:06.717
- Are you seriously asking...?
- Want out of this jail...

13:06.892 --> 13:10.055
...you're gonna tell me everything
you can about that man...

13:10.229 --> 13:11.890
...and the so-called light.

13:12.765 --> 13:14.460
Okay.

13:14.867 --> 13:16.698
I saw it...

13:17.102 --> 13:18.433
...and then we were here.

13:21.707 --> 13:26.076
Would you say
that it was all around you...

13:26.245 --> 13:28.941
...or that more that it came from inside
this fella?

13:30.482 --> 13:31.779
You believe me.

13:33.118 --> 13:34.676
Are you...?

13:36.822 --> 13:38.084
You're a hunter.

13:39.692 --> 13:44.095
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Demons, ghosts, shifters.

13:44.263 --> 13:46.288
Hey, I've killed them all.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.128
And you're the same.

13:49.301 --> 13:50.962
Just 68 years before me.

13:51.303 --> 13:52.770
Huh?

13:56.208 --> 13:58.836
Huh. And your name is?

13:59.812 --> 14:01.712
Dean. Winchester.

14:02.214 --> 14:03.806
Ness.

14:04.950 --> 14:06.315
Eliot Ness.

14:25.604 --> 14:28.129
- Dean.
- No. Why? Where's Dean?

14:28.307 --> 14:32.266
The thing that's been mummifying
people took him and disappeared.

14:32.444 --> 14:33.604
You guys get that a lot?

14:33.779 --> 14:37.374
<i>- Yeah. More than most people.
- Well, I got you into this, so...</i>

14:37.549 --> 14:40.040
<i>- No, you didn't. All you did was...
- Shut up, Sam.</i>

14:40.252 --> 14:41.810
How can I help?

14:43.055 --> 14:44.522
Well...

14:45.324 --> 14:48.157
...how do you feel about driving
and lifting boxes?

14:54.466 --> 14:57.697
<i>I gotta tell you, Untouchables
is one of my favorite movies ever.</i>

14:57.870 --> 14:59.861
- What?
- Must've seen that thing 50 times.

15:00.038 --> 15:02.506
- Seen it? What? I'm in a...?
- You don't even know.

15:02.674 --> 15:04.801
- Oh, you are... Pfft!
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait...

15:04.977 --> 15:08.640
Just slow it down, okay?

15:08.814 --> 15:14.218
Now, time travel. Is that something you find
up a lot of sleeves in the future or...?

15:14.386 --> 15:18.049
No, no, no.
It's not normally on the menu.

15:18.223 --> 15:20.487
I'm as surprised as you are
that I'm here.

15:20.659 --> 15:24.493
So we're hunting the same thing?
Just in different centuries.

15:28.901 --> 15:30.732
Two bodies.

15:30.903 --> 15:34.270
Few days apart,
just a little over a month ago.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.341
One witness said
that she saw an assailant light up red...

15:37.509 --> 15:39.443
...after sucking the life out of a man.

15:39.611 --> 15:40.703
Awesome.

15:41.346 --> 15:43.314
How does that fill you with awe?

15:44.750 --> 15:48.117
Look, Dean, this thing, it kills...

15:48.320 --> 15:50.015
- In threes.
- In threes.

15:50.189 --> 15:51.747
But you already know that.

15:51.924 --> 15:53.755
He's two down.

16:00.332 --> 16:04.029
You're coming with me. We gotta get
this thing before it grabs the last one.

16:04.203 --> 16:07.138
So wait. Uh... Ahem. Does...

16:07.339 --> 16:09.773
Does this mean
that I'm an Untouchable now?

16:10.075 --> 16:15.411
It means we gotta get you new clothes.
You look like some kind of bindle stiff.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.750
Stiff your brin... Bin... What?

16:37.936 --> 16:39.301
Mm.

16:39.471 --> 16:43.498
- What's the rumpus, Eliot?
- Ezra Moore.

16:44.142 --> 16:45.507
Dean Winchester.

16:47.613 --> 16:48.671
Hey.

16:48.881 --> 16:50.405
Who's he? Some farmer clown?

16:50.582 --> 16:52.914
He's from the future.

16:53.485 --> 16:54.611
Yeah.

16:54.786 --> 16:58.347
Gas costs 4 bucks and you can
get cheese out of a spray can.

16:58.524 --> 17:00.924
The president is a black guy.

17:01.093 --> 17:02.424
I could go on.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.692
Paint me impressed.

17:06.098 --> 17:08.828
I assume you need some clothes.

17:10.536 --> 17:13.027
- Hey, let me help you with those.
- No, I got these.

17:13.204 --> 17:16.299
- You go get the other 20 in my truck.
- Seriously?

17:16.642 --> 17:20.203
Yeah. I think Bobby may have had
a slight hoarding issue.

17:20.412 --> 17:22.778
I could barely get the door open
on that locker.

17:22.948 --> 17:26.474
And I'm pretty sure something's alive
in at least three of those boxes.

17:53.979 --> 17:56.379
- Awesome.
- Awesome?

17:56.748 --> 17:58.147
You some religious kook?

17:58.317 --> 18:01.013
No, he just likes saying that.

18:01.186 --> 18:03.552
So spill already.

18:03.722 --> 18:08.159
What bucket of syrup did you two idiots
step into?

18:09.828 --> 18:11.159
Something funny, sweetheart?

18:11.330 --> 18:14.527
No, you just kind of remind me
of someone.

18:14.700 --> 18:18.864
Okay, Ezra, we need your help.
It seems we're hunting a time traveler.

18:19.237 --> 18:20.329
Delightful.

18:24.910 --> 18:26.468
Got it.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.043
Is that a ring on his finger?

18:33.285 --> 18:34.513
Uh...

18:38.357 --> 18:39.756
Yeah.

18:49.501 --> 18:50.559
I know that symbol.

18:52.638 --> 18:54.731
It's the Infinite Hourglass.

18:54.906 --> 18:56.601
That's a symbol I saw on his ring.

18:56.775 --> 18:59.243
- Yeah. That's the mark of Cronus.
- Who?

18:59.411 --> 19:01.470
- The god of time.
- That's crazy.

19:01.647 --> 19:05.879
Thing is with the old gods, once upon
a time, they were just short of invincible.

19:06.051 --> 19:08.645
Got their mojo from worshippers,
people feeding them.

19:08.820 --> 19:11.653
- These days not so much?
- They're not what they used to be.

19:11.823 --> 19:14.724
They make up for lack of power
with being twice as pissed...

19:14.893 --> 19:19.091
...and a lot more hands-on.
Okay. So why is this god killing people?

19:19.264 --> 19:22.131
Could be he's killing folks
for his time juice.

19:22.434 --> 19:24.959
Well, how the hell
am I gonna ride him back to 2012?

19:25.137 --> 19:27.002
Well, you could let him grab you.

19:27.172 --> 19:29.504
If you don't mind him using you
for gasoline.

19:29.675 --> 19:32.337
How do we get Dean back?
How do we find this Cronus?

19:32.544 --> 19:34.171
Best stab?

19:36.114 --> 19:38.344
Find a way to summon a god.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.108
Let's stick to what we know.

19:40.285 --> 19:44.153
Ezra, see if you have something
in all this junk that will kill a god.

19:44.589 --> 19:45.817
No trouble at all.

19:46.324 --> 19:49.088
Come in a few hours,
see what I can scrounge up.

19:49.261 --> 19:51.752
Say, you said you fellas
found his house.

19:51.930 --> 19:54.262
Let's go see if it's been built yet.

19:54.966 --> 19:57.025
And then let's kill that bastard.

19:57.202 --> 20:00.569
- Because that...
- Is the Chicago way.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.676
Chicago way?

20:05.844 --> 20:07.641
Who talks like that?

20:08.380 --> 20:10.348
Sean Connery.

20:13.118 --> 20:14.176
Come on.

20:16.788 --> 20:19.382
I'll never watch that movie again.

20:25.597 --> 20:27.656
It looks empty. You got a lock pick?

20:27.833 --> 20:29.357
Sure.

20:44.850 --> 20:46.613
Take a look around.

20:47.753 --> 20:50.221
Where's he getting all the lettuce
to support this?

21:10.075 --> 21:11.508
He's using the Biff Strategy.

21:11.777 --> 21:15.235
- Using the what?
- Cronus is betting on races...

21:15.413 --> 21:17.938
...he already knows the outcome of.
Look at this.

21:21.019 --> 21:24.182
- He spent a lot of time in '44.
- Yeah.

21:24.356 --> 21:26.847
What's LY?

21:27.192 --> 21:28.625
It's not a what, it's a who.

21:28.794 --> 21:31.786
Lester Young.
He lays bets for a lot of flunkies in town.

21:31.963 --> 21:34.158
Let's go pay him a visit.

21:34.599 --> 21:36.430
Hey. Whoa.

21:36.601 --> 21:38.967
Hey. Hey, easy with the jacket.

21:41.773 --> 21:42.865
Hey, I ain't talking.

21:43.942 --> 21:45.569
I'm no stoolie.

21:51.216 --> 21:53.548
I learned it from watching you.

22:01.593 --> 22:06.496
Look, you seem like a swell guy,
Lester, and I wanna help you out. I do.

22:06.698 --> 22:08.996
But my partner?
He just got back from the war.

22:09.434 --> 22:12.426
And he spent the last two years
kicking in Nazi skulls.

22:12.604 --> 22:15.664
If he doesn't kick in a skull
every couple days...

22:15.841 --> 22:16.967
...he gets real touchy.

22:17.442 --> 22:18.909
Lester.

22:19.077 --> 22:20.442
That a German name?

22:20.612 --> 22:23.479
Hey, yeah, okay, okay.
There's no need to snap your cap.

22:23.648 --> 22:25.309
Who you looking for?

22:25.617 --> 22:26.948
Fella by the name of Snider.

22:27.619 --> 22:28.677
What? That guy?

22:28.854 --> 22:32.255
I mean, bum never missed a bet.
But he gave me the heebie-jeebies...

22:32.424 --> 22:35.257
...so I cut him off.
Where'd you meet him for the payoff?

22:37.729 --> 22:41.665
The Early Bird, the dive on Haggerty.
Practically lives in the joint.

22:57.148 --> 22:58.206
- Damn it.
- That's it.

22:58.383 --> 23:01.819
- Yours sounds better. You first.
- It says people could summon Cronus...

23:01.987 --> 23:03.955
...to compel him to tell their futures.

23:04.122 --> 23:06.317
And I've got the spell to do it
right here.

23:06.491 --> 23:08.391
So why the "damn it"?

23:09.361 --> 23:11.454
Because calling Cronus
isn't the problem.

23:11.630 --> 23:14.861
It's making sure we summon him
when Dean is right there.

23:15.033 --> 23:18.833
Literally, with his hands on the guy
so he can surf him back.

23:19.004 --> 23:20.369
That's not automatic?

23:20.538 --> 23:24.201
More like we need to get the time
on their end right to the exact second.

23:24.376 --> 23:27.243
Or we get an angry god,
but no big brother.

23:27.412 --> 23:29.380
And he's trapped forever.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.555
"Fine, you ass, you win for once.

23:44.729 --> 23:46.356
Enjoy. R."

23:48.733 --> 23:50.496
- Who's R?
- Rufus.

23:50.869 --> 23:53.394
- A family friend.
- Ah. Right.

23:54.005 --> 23:56.667
- Wonder what they were betting over?
- Whatever it was...

23:56.841 --> 23:58.331
...Rufus sure was a sore loser.

24:01.046 --> 24:02.172
Yeah.

24:04.082 --> 24:05.879
It's weird, huh?

24:08.853 --> 24:10.912
It's like their life's a big puzzle.

24:11.856 --> 24:16.088
You just keep finding pieces of it
scattered all over the place.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.820
We should drink this.

24:23.234 --> 24:25.031
He'd want us to.

24:25.337 --> 24:26.634
Am I wrong?

24:28.373 --> 24:30.534
It would be rude not to.

24:46.224 --> 24:47.851
- That's him.
- Mm-hm.

24:48.093 --> 24:49.355
Kind of puny for a god.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.231
Thought you were Mr. Boy-Scout.

24:58.937 --> 25:02.930
Why do you think I went after Capone?
The guy had the best hooch in Chicago.

25:04.376 --> 25:06.674
So who died in your life
and made you a hunter?

25:06.878 --> 25:10.109
Who died?
Nobody died, you morbid son of a bitch.

25:10.448 --> 25:13.781
I started doing this because vampires
were turning folks in Cleveland.

25:13.952 --> 25:17.319
- Then you caught the bug.
- That's when I got the bug.

25:21.793 --> 25:26.890
Sometimes you just wanna punch
through the red tape with a silver bullet.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.628
Yeah. Hunting sets me free.
Isn't that why you hunt?

25:31.803 --> 25:34.294
I used to do it
because that's what my family did.

25:34.472 --> 25:38.340
- Hmm.
- But they just seem to keep dying.

25:41.012 --> 25:44.971
Tell you the truth, I don't know why
I'm doing much of anything anymore.

25:46.785 --> 25:48.548
Boo-hoo. Cry me a river, you nancy.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.447
Tell me, are all hunters as soft as you
in the future?

25:53.324 --> 25:55.815
Everybody loses everybody.
And then one day, boom.

25:55.994 --> 25:59.953
Your number's up.
But at least you're making a difference.

26:00.865 --> 26:03.299
So enjoy it while it lasts, kid...

26:03.802 --> 26:07.238
...because hunting is the only clarity
you're gonna find in this life.

26:08.740 --> 26:11.300
And that makes you luckier
than most.

26:18.349 --> 26:20.078
Hello, nurse.

26:26.591 --> 26:27.683
Hey.

26:53.618 --> 26:55.518
Sweet merciful awesome.

27:28.586 --> 27:30.747
Well, thank you very much.

27:31.723 --> 27:33.384
Good night.

27:38.563 --> 27:40.428
Well, everything's coming up us, kid.

27:40.732 --> 27:41.790
Talk to me.

27:42.901 --> 27:44.129
I am.

27:45.136 --> 27:49.095
The owner of the house,
Miss Lila Taylor, age 20, lives alone.

27:49.541 --> 27:51.600
Head back to Ezra's,
see what she's got.

27:51.776 --> 27:54.836
I'm gonna stay and keep my peepers
on the Sheik and the Sheba.

28:10.328 --> 28:11.420
That's it?

28:11.596 --> 28:14.190
That is a thousand-year-old olive...

28:14.365 --> 28:17.425
...carved by vestal virgins
and dipped in the blood...

28:17.602 --> 28:19.092
...of you-don't-wanna-know.

28:19.270 --> 28:22.933
Pulling this together wasn't easy.
You and Ness both owe me, smoothie.

28:23.875 --> 28:26.708
Heh. You can have whatever you want...

28:26.878 --> 28:29.278
...as soon as we gank this thing.
Yeah, yeah.

28:29.447 --> 28:30.675
Take your twig, wise guy.

28:30.848 --> 28:32.679
But how does it work?

28:34.619 --> 28:37.349
You stick this end in his heart.

28:37.522 --> 28:40.116
Miss, he has you for supper.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.349
Make sense?

28:44.329 --> 28:48.595
Wait. If I kill Cronus, I'm stuck here?

28:48.900 --> 28:50.367
You just now realized?

28:52.870 --> 28:56.067
Oh, come on. 1944 ain't so bad.

28:56.241 --> 28:58.869
Yeah, head over to Europe,
punch Hitler in the neck.

28:59.043 --> 29:03.173
Oh, there's lots of ways
to pass the time, sugar.

29:07.552 --> 29:09.349
That's for luck.

29:10.054 --> 29:12.147
Because I'm lucky.

29:12.523 --> 29:14.184
Thanks.

29:28.773 --> 29:31.071
<i>Back to the Future III.</i>

29:32.210 --> 29:34.144
Need to borrow some paper.

29:42.887 --> 29:44.650
Mr. Ness, I presume.

29:46.424 --> 29:49.860
Can I stop by the station to take care
of that hunter who rode me here?

29:50.028 --> 29:53.020
Heard you took him out ofjail.
Thought I might see you again.

30:08.479 --> 30:10.276
Ethan?

30:11.449 --> 30:12.882
There you are.

30:13.251 --> 30:16.049
Can't take the trash out
without the trash, silly.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.414
Sorry, honey.

30:18.823 --> 30:20.586
I don't know where I left my head.

30:20.758 --> 30:22.282
Be right there.

30:56.189 --> 30:58.248
Sweetie, I want you to pack a bag.

30:58.425 --> 31:00.017
Excuse me?

31:00.861 --> 31:04.524
Well, you're always asking me
where I go. Come with me, tonight.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.893
Is everything okay?

31:07.067 --> 31:09.160
Yeah, everything's perfect.

31:09.336 --> 31:10.394
You're perfect.

31:12.839 --> 31:15.330
I need you to pack a bag
and I'll explain on the way.

31:15.509 --> 31:17.670
- But the diner...
- Forget about them.

31:20.614 --> 31:22.445
We'll call them tomorrow, okay?

31:22.883 --> 31:26.444
- Just go, pack.
- Uh...

Jackpot.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.082
- Termites?
- Yes, sir.

32:03.256 --> 32:06.248
There's been an outbreak
all over this area...

32:06.426 --> 32:08.451
...and I just wanna do an inspection.

32:08.628 --> 32:10.493
Make sure that the perimeter is secure.

32:11.098 --> 32:13.157
Yeah. Yes, of course.

Uh... Yeah. No.

32:44.197 --> 32:45.858
No, no. Not to worry.

32:46.032 --> 32:49.968
Because I'm going to install something
that will protect this house forever.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.286
Yeah.

That's okay. I can...

33:21.234 --> 33:23.964
Do I have to use my mom voice?

34:09.916 --> 34:11.781
All right, you asked for it.
Young man...

34:14.187 --> 34:16.951
"Sammy, turns out Snider is Cronus."

34:17.123 --> 34:20.251
- Wait, this is from Dean? How...?
- Just read.

34:22.262 --> 34:25.129
"I rode him to 1944.
Am working with Eliot Ness.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.889
Yes, that one.

some chick named Lila Taylor.

34:33.406 --> 34:35.306
We got a weapon.
We're going after him.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.806
Take care of yourself, Sam."

34:38.210 --> 34:39.303
Look at the top.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.639
November 5th, '44.

34:41.815 --> 34:44.612
So now we know the exact date
Dean had hands on Cronus.

34:44.784 --> 34:46.911
- We need the exact time.
- Which we get how?

34:47.087 --> 34:49.612
Hoping. We ask someone
who was there.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.514
Miss Lila Taylor?

<i>Can you get the Sullivan Show?

not to read those comic books.

35:09.643 --> 35:12.407
No, no, no. He's fine.

35:13.146 --> 35:15.614
We wanted to ask you some questions
about this man.

35:21.688 --> 35:22.780
Ethan.

35:23.590 --> 35:24.648
That's Ethan.

35:26.092 --> 35:28.959
Do you remember
the last time you saw Ethan?

35:29.129 --> 35:30.426
Of course.

35:30.764 --> 35:33.824
November, 1944.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.695
The night the clocks stopped.

35:35.869 --> 35:37.769
The clocks stopped?

35:37.937 --> 35:40.269
Eleven thirty-four.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.271
Every clock in the house.

35:45.845 --> 35:48.211
Ma'am, can you tell us anything else
you remember?

35:48.982 --> 35:53.112
Ethan said awful things.

35:53.286 --> 35:58.223
And then he strangled that poor man.

35:58.391 --> 35:59.824
What poor man?

36:01.027 --> 36:04.292
Two policemen came to arrest Ethan.

36:08.101 --> 36:10.467
Ma'am, was this one of them?

36:12.005 --> 36:15.406
Ethan choked the life out of that man.

36:31.157 --> 36:32.886
Ness?

36:33.727 --> 36:35.490
Ness?

37:42.495 --> 37:43.928
Ethan.

37:45.398 --> 37:46.456
Let's talk.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.776
Here. Break this.

38:07.654 --> 38:09.849
- Don't hurt her.
- Ethan, what's happening?

38:10.023 --> 38:12.685
- Yeah, Ethan. What the hell...?
- Lila, I'm sorry.

38:12.859 --> 38:14.690
Everything I said to you is true.

38:14.861 --> 38:17.796
He might've left a few details.
He tell you he's a monster...

38:17.964 --> 38:19.693
...jumps through time...?
I'm a god!

38:19.866 --> 38:21.959
Look, I'm not a monster.

38:22.135 --> 38:23.727
Listen. I'm the opposite.

38:23.903 --> 38:26.838
Don't forget about the people
you murdered along the way.

38:27.006 --> 38:29.634
- What?
- It's not like that. I do it for you, Lila.

38:30.210 --> 38:31.472
I don't understand.

38:48.094 --> 38:51.552
Well, he's not as strong
as he used to be. Ain't that right, Ethan?

38:52.298 --> 38:54.766
You know, you gotta go out
and suck people dry.

38:54.934 --> 38:58.802
- It takes three kills to juice you up.
- Sacrifices.

38:59.239 --> 39:03.699
And I can control when and where I land. But
once I get there, it's never for long...

39:03.877 --> 39:06.368
...before I'm tossed through time again.
That's my life.

39:06.546 --> 39:08.036
All I want is to get back here.

39:08.214 --> 39:10.512
Because you just love
the clean Canton air.

39:10.683 --> 39:11.809
Because I love her.

39:12.952 --> 39:16.046
I lead the worst existence
you can imagine and then I found you.

39:16.222 --> 39:19.214
After you killed Tyler Crosby
and Cathy Porter...

39:19.626 --> 39:22.094
...Lila was gonna be
victim number three, right?

39:22.262 --> 39:25.026
Don't act like you never
killed a soul before, pal.

39:25.198 --> 39:29.032
Something tells me you used to kill
three saps just for a change of scenery.

39:29.202 --> 39:32.137
- Yes, I did.
- Back down.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.773
I used to wander.

39:36.576 --> 39:37.770
But now I have you.

39:37.944 --> 39:39.343
I knew Cathy.

39:39.779 --> 39:41.906
She used to come into the diner
every day.

39:42.081 --> 39:44.777
- Lila, please.
- You are a monster.

39:44.951 --> 39:46.748
No, Lila, please.

40:08.074 --> 40:09.132
No.

40:14.147 --> 40:15.614
Hey. Untouchable!

40:22.889 --> 40:23.981
Dean.

40:25.825 --> 40:26.917
Hey.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.430
No!

40:31.598 --> 40:34.294
You! You destroyed everything!

40:35.335 --> 40:36.632
Hey, Cronus.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.337
Was that the best you got?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.784
You wanna know your future?

40:57.991 --> 41:00.118
I know your future.

41:01.427 --> 41:06.160
It's covered in thick, black ooze.

41:09.669 --> 41:11.227
It's everywhere.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.835
They're everywhere.

41:17.343 --> 41:19.504
Enjoy oblivion.
