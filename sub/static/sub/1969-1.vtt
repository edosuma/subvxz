01:19.310 --> 01:22.870
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.570
Nothing but blue pills.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.510
- Should we try to contact them?
- Won't matter. My gut says they're down.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.780
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.420
I was afraid you'd say that.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.250
Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.860
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

01:39.030 --> 01:42.760
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- The sooner we find them the better.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.800
- Thought you could use something to eat.
- Thank you.

01:53.140 --> 01:55.470
Any change?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.410
No.

01:59.450 --> 02:03.280
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.040
At least until he wakes up.

02:06.220 --> 02:10.419
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.750
He'd better have some good answers.

02:12.930 --> 02:16.090
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

02:16.260 --> 02:20.330
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.800
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.140
Roland, I'd like to run another search
through the Matrix.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.510
- For what?
- For Neo.

02:32.780 --> 02:36.050
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.450
Please, for me.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.660
This is what keeps bothering me.

02:50.830 --> 02:52.820
What?

02:53.570 --> 02:56.700
His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.810
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.270
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.320
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.690
- Sir, I got the projections.
- How long?

03:20.860 --> 03:25.390
Based on point of entry and the past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.200
Jesus H. Christ.

03:28.900 --> 03:33.000
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.580
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.580
And make sure we are running
on as few pads as possible.

03:40.750 --> 03:43.950
- Hey! You got a call.
- What?

03:45.320 --> 03:47.480
Operator.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.260
It's Seraph.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.650
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.140
Good morning.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.910
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.110
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.320
Are you lost, Neo?

04:24.560 --> 04:28.520
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

04:31.330 --> 04:34.630
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.100
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

04:39.270 --> 04:42.240
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

04:43.210 --> 04:46.940
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.450
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

04:50.620 --> 04:54.520
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.770
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

05:14.510 --> 05:16.710
One thing I've learned in all my years...

05:16.880 --> 05:19.970
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.180
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

05:25.690 --> 05:30.220
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.260
I'm sorry this had to happen.

05:33.430 --> 05:37.020
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

05:37.200 --> 05:40.130
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

05:40.670 --> 05:45.200
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

05:45.510 --> 05:46.770
What choice?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.080
To help you, to guide Neo.

05:50.250 --> 05:55.180
Now, since the real test for any choice
is having to make the same choice again...

05:55.350 --> 05:59.180
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

05:59.350 --> 06:03.480
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

06:03.660 --> 06:06.390
...because here I am, at it again.

06:06.660 --> 06:10.430
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.330
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

06:15.670 --> 06:19.800
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

06:19.970 --> 06:24.540
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.880
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

06:28.050 --> 06:31.490
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

06:31.650 --> 06:34.820
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.820
The Merovingian.

06:36.990 --> 06:41.520
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

06:42.030 --> 06:46.230
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

06:46.500 --> 06:50.170
For years he has protected me.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.830
I hope he can do the same for you.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.710
Please, follow me.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.310
Oracle...

07:03.490 --> 07:05.680
I know, Morpheus.

07:05.850 --> 07:09.620
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

07:09.790 --> 07:14.420
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.330
I don't.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.160
I expect just what I've always expected:

07:19.330 --> 07:23.640
For you to make up your own damn mind.
Believe me or don't.

07:23.810 --> 07:29.240
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

07:29.410 --> 07:32.850
He needs all our help.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.880
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.280
No.

07:37.450 --> 07:41.480
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

07:42.360 --> 07:45.660
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

07:46.130 --> 07:49.590
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.260
Yes, Papa.

07:56.140 --> 07:59.770
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.710
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.610
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.780
We are most honored to meet you.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.550
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.180
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.460
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

08:22.630 --> 08:25.120
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

08:25.300 --> 08:30.200
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.940
It's okay.

08:33.270 --> 08:34.799
I don't have an answer.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.500
- I don't even know where "here" is.
- This place is nowhere.

08:38.850 --> 08:41.480
It is between your world and our world.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.980
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.360
Why did I know you would say that?

08:48.520 --> 08:52.460
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

08:52.890 --> 08:55.520
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.630
I know that if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

08:59.800 --> 09:03.070
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.870
Is that what you're doing here?

09:05.040 --> 09:09.000
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.340
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.950
I'm sorry.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.380
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

09:18.050 --> 09:20.350
The answer is simple.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.290
I love my daughter very much.

09:28.460 --> 09:31.990
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.900
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

09:35.070 --> 09:37.730
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.270
If it does not, it is deleted.

09:41.440 --> 09:45.110
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

09:46.710 --> 09:50.010
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

09:50.190 --> 09:52.590
Heard a program speak of love.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.690
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

09:57.860 --> 10:02.260
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.660
I see that you are in love.

10:08.270 --> 10:12.330
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

10:12.510 --> 10:13.740
Anything.

10:14.010 --> 10:19.340
Then perhaps the reason you are here is not
so different than the reason I am here.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.950
That's him.

10:30.090 --> 10:32.990
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.060
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

10:36.230 --> 10:39.830
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

11:30.820 --> 11:32.050
Oh, no!

11:44.670 --> 11:45.660
Damn it!

11:49.300 --> 11:53.330
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.700
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

11:56.310 --> 11:59.800
- You think it has something to do with me?
- I cannot say.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.850
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.880
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

12:06.050 --> 12:08.820
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.520
She promised to watch Sati
after we said goodbye.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.660
Goodbye?

12:13.830 --> 12:16.490
- You're not staying with her?
- It is not possible.

12:16.660 --> 12:20.730
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

12:20.900 --> 12:24.340
- My wife and I must return to our world.
- Why?

12:24.640 --> 12:27.570
- That is our karma.
- You believe in karma?

12:27.740 --> 12:30.940
Karma is a word, like love.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.910
A way of saying:

12:33.080 --> 12:35.310
"What I am here to do."

12:35.480 --> 12:39.110
I do not resent my karma.
I'm grateful for it.

12:39.290 --> 12:42.810
Grateful for my wonderful wife,
for my beautiful daughter.

12:42.990 --> 12:47.050
They are gifts, and so I do
what I must do to honor them.

12:48.630 --> 12:53.400
- Papa, the train!
- Yes. Find your bag. Quickly.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.070
Can I carry that for you?

12:58.270 --> 13:00.260
All right.

13:05.650 --> 13:06.980
Hurry it up, I'm late!

13:12.490 --> 13:15.320
- Who are you?
- He is a friend.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.890
I know you.

13:19.060 --> 13:22.790
- So that's what they wanted.
- I need to get back.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.330
I'll pay you whatever you want.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.970
One way or another,
I'm getting on this train.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.830
Oh, no, no, no.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.910
You'll stay here until
the Merovingian says different.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.600
If I know him...

13:35.780 --> 13:39.240
...you're gonna be here
for a long, long time.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.520
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You don't get it.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.280
I built this place.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.760
Down here, I make the rules.
Down here, I make the threats.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.300
Down here, I'm God.

14:01.670 --> 14:05.470
Get on the train
or you'll stay here with him.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.230
We should return to the Oracle.
She will know what to do.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.120
No. We know what has to be done.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.200
Shit.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.980
You gotta be kidding.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.200
Holy shit, it's wingless.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.500
I get it.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.510
You must be ready to die.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.380
I need to speak with him.

15:24.550 --> 15:29.220
Only way you're getting through this door
is over my big, dead ass.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.320
So be it.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.980
There are no weapons allowed
in the club.

15:57.150 --> 16:00.590
At the bottom of this elevator,
there is a coat-check girl...

16:00.760 --> 16:03.950
...and if we are lucky,
one man for checking weapons.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.290
And if we're unlucky?

16:06.460 --> 16:08.290
There will be many men.

16:10.060 --> 16:12.830
Can I take your...? Oh, my God.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.070
What in the hell?

18:39.810 --> 18:41.650
I don't believe this.

18:47.890 --> 18:48.910
Hey!

18:53.260 --> 18:56.250
The prodigal child returns.

18:58.830 --> 19:02.500
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

19:04.540 --> 19:07.440
Tell me, how many bullets
are there in those guns?

19:07.610 --> 19:10.770
I don't know, but I don't think
you have enough.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.780
- We only want to talk.
- Oh, yes.

19:13.950 --> 19:19.320
I'm sure you do. You have fought
through Hel to do so. Yes?

19:19.690 --> 19:21.680
I'll tell you what I will do.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.820
Put down the guns, and I will promise you
a safe passage out of here.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.590
- All three of us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.490
Of course.

19:57.530 --> 20:03.290
Who could have guessed we would see
each other so soon after our last meeting?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.570
The Fates are too kind, eh?

20:06.730 --> 20:10.230
And since you, my little Judas,
have brought them here...

20:10.400 --> 20:15.240
...I can only surmise that the fortuneteller
has found herself another shell?

20:15.410 --> 20:18.680
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

20:18.850 --> 20:22.340
I do hope, however, she has the good
manners to learn her lesson...

20:22.520 --> 20:25.820
...and to remember that there is
no action without consequence.

20:25.990 --> 20:31.080
And if you take something from me,
you will pay the price.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.060
You know why we are here?

20:34.700 --> 20:37.820
Come now, what kind of question is this?
Of course I know.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.090
It is my business to know.

20:40.270 --> 20:43.500
Some might think this is a strange
coincidence, but I do not.

20:43.940 --> 20:50.240
I am curious, though,
as to how it actually happened.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.540
- Do you know?
- No.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.440
No?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.780
I did not think so.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.890
But it is always best to ask, huh?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.110
We want to make a deal.

21:03.590 --> 21:08.090
Always straight to business,
huh, Morpheus?

21:08.260 --> 21:12.600
Okay. I have something you want.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.700
To make a deal...

21:14.870 --> 21:20.430
...you must have something
I want, yes?

21:20.610 --> 21:24.910
And it so happens
there is something I want.

21:25.080 --> 21:29.450
Something I have wanted
ever since I first came here.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.420
It is said they cannot be taken...

21:32.820 --> 21:35.150
...they can only be given.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.550
What?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.650
The eyes of the Oracle.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.990
I told you before, there is no escaping
the nature of the universe.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.930
It is that nature
that has again brought you to me.

21:52.110 --> 21:55.740
Where some see coincidence,
I see consequence.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.210
Where others see chance...

21:58.380 --> 22:01.910
...I see cost.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.380
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle...

22:07.890 --> 22:10.860
...and I will give you back your savior.

22:11.490 --> 22:15.760
It seems a perfectly fair
and reasonable deal to me.

22:16.630 --> 22:17.860
Yes? No?

22:20.330 --> 22:22.030
I don't have time for this shit.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.530
You wanna make a deal?
How about this?

22:56.700 --> 23:00.770
You give me Neo, or we all die,
right here, right now.

23:01.740 --> 23:04.680
Interesting deal.

23:06.850 --> 23:11.650
You are really ready to die
for this man?

23:12.820 --> 23:15.410
- Believe it.
- She'll do it.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.790
If she has to,
she'll kill every one of us.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.450
She's in love.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.700
It is remarkable how similar the pattern
of love is to the pattern of insanity.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.460
Time's up.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.190
What's it gonna be, Merv?

23:34.810 --> 23:38.680
Okay. You got yourself in here...

23:38.850 --> 23:41.440
...you can get yourself out.

24:29.230 --> 24:30.460
Are you ready for us?

24:30.630 --> 24:33.600
Almost, sir. They got
some pretty ancient hacks here.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.900
- But you found Neo?
- Can't you see him?

24:36.070 --> 24:39.010
No, sir. We read something,
but I couldn't tell what.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.100
I can't leave yet.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.410
I have to see her.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.310
Now?

24:54.420 --> 24:55.820
It's my last chance.

24:58.490 --> 25:00.820
That's it. That's the secret.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.160
- You've got to use your hands.
- Why?

25:03.660 --> 25:06.260
Cookies need love like everything does.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.540
Neo!

25:09.900 --> 25:14.810
I was hoping to have these done
before you got here. Oh, well.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.900
Sati, honey, I think it's time
for a tasting.

25:19.210 --> 25:22.080
Take the bowl to Seraph
and find out if they're ready.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.340
Okay.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.510
- I'm glad you got out.
- Me too.

25:31.390 --> 25:34.760
So do you recognize me?

25:34.930 --> 25:38.130
- A part of you.
- Yeah, that's how it works.

25:38.300 --> 25:41.130
Some bits you lose,
some bits you keep.

25:41.300 --> 25:45.140
I don't yet recognize my face
in the mirror...

25:46.740 --> 25:48.670
...but I still love candy.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.510
No, thank you.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.810
Remember how you were
when you first walked through my door?

25:55.980 --> 26:01.080
Jittery as a June bug.
And now, just look at you.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.490
You sure did surprise me, Neo,
and you still do.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.950
You gave me a few surprises too.

26:08.130 --> 26:10.430
I hope I helped.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.000
You helped me to get here,
but my question is, why?

26:14.270 --> 26:15.960
Where is this going?

26:16.140 --> 26:18.660
- Where does it end?
- I don't know.

26:18.970 --> 26:22.370
- You don't know or you won't tell me?
- I told you before...

26:22.880 --> 26:27.840
...no one can see beyond a choice
they don't understand, and I mean no one.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.350
- What choice?
- It doesn't matter. It's my choice.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.050
I have mine to make,
same as you have yours.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.290
Does that include what things
to tell me and what not to?

26:38.460 --> 26:41.990
- Of course not.
- Why didn't you tell me about the Architect?

26:42.160 --> 26:46.400
About Zion and the ones before me?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

26:47.330 --> 26:51.200
- Because it wasn't time for you to know.
- Who decided it wasn't time?

26:51.670 --> 26:54.300
You know who.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.210
I did.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.080
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.980
So do I.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.090
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

27:13.260 --> 27:15.960
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

27:16.630 --> 27:20.260
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

27:22.370 --> 27:25.900
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

27:26.070 --> 27:29.630
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

27:29.810 --> 27:32.040
- Where?
- The source.

27:32.210 --> 27:36.880
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready for it.

27:37.380 --> 27:43.020
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

27:44.960 --> 27:49.790
The Architect said that if I didn't return to
the source, Zion would be destroyed tonight.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.260
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

27:54.430 --> 27:57.200
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

27:57.700 --> 28:01.440
- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

28:01.610 --> 28:04.310
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.510
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

28:08.680 --> 28:12.380
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.910
What's your purpose?

28:15.090 --> 28:17.110
To unbalance it.

28:17.290 --> 28:19.380
Why? What do you want?

28:19.990 --> 28:23.490
I want the same thing you want, Neo.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.530
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.540
The end of the war.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.600
Is it going to end?

28:32.410 --> 28:34.470
One way or another.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.440
Can Zion be saved?

28:38.850 --> 28:43.680
I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

28:44.520 --> 28:49.390
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.250
- Where?
- You know where.

28:54.230 --> 28:57.320
And if you can't find the answer...

28:57.500 --> 29:00.990
...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.330
What does that mean?

29:09.340 --> 29:12.970
Everything that has a beginning...

29:13.150 --> 29:15.620
...has an end.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.720
I see the end coming.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.790
I see the darkness spreading.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.390
I see death.

29:24.090 --> 29:27.750
And you are all that stands in his way.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.160
Smith.

29:30.100 --> 29:34.470
Very soon, he is going to have the power
to destroy this world.

29:34.630 --> 29:37.370
But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.600
He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

29:40.910 --> 29:42.310
What is he?

29:42.480 --> 29:44.410
He is you.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.010
Your opposite, your negative.

29:47.180 --> 29:50.780
The result of the equation
trying to balance itself out.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.990
- And if I can't stop him?
- One way or another, Neo...

29:55.760 --> 29:59.020
...this war is going to end.

29:59.190 --> 30:04.100
Tonight, the future of both worlds
will be in your hands...

30:04.260 --> 30:06.100
...or in his.

30:22.550 --> 30:25.140
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

30:32.290 --> 30:34.620
I need time.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.860
- That figures.
- Captain Roland.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.370
- What's up, Maggie?
- Bane is. He's conscious.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.670
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.720
I love that smell.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.810
I sure am going to miss it.

31:02.490 --> 31:05.620
- Oracle.
- I know.

31:05.790 --> 31:07.020
I know.

31:07.190 --> 31:09.890
Sati, honey.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.330
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.270
Can I come back?
I would like to come back.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.840
- I would like that too.
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.010
I hope so, hon, I hope so.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.040
I'm scared, Seraph.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.570
Come.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.450
He's following us.

32:42.620 --> 32:46.420
Well, well, it's been a long time.

32:47.890 --> 32:50.960
I remember chasing you
was like chasing a ghost.

32:51.330 --> 32:53.090
I have beaten you before.

32:53.600 --> 32:59.040
Yes, true, but as you can see,
things are a little different now.

32:59.970 --> 33:02.970
And you must be the last exile.

33:03.610 --> 33:07.140
- The Oracle told me about you.
- Really?

33:07.310 --> 33:09.210
What did she say about me?

33:09.620 --> 33:11.310
That you were a bad man.

33:11.620 --> 33:16.350
Oh, I'm not so bad,
once you get to know me.

33:44.990 --> 33:49.550
The great and powerful Oracle,
we meet at last.

33:52.430 --> 33:56.790
I suppose you've been
expecting me, right?

33:56.960 --> 34:02.730
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised.
How can she be? She knows everything.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.600
But if that's true, then why is she here
if she knew I was coming?

34:07.770 --> 34:09.830
Why wouldn't she leave?

34:15.320 --> 34:17.840
Maybe you knew I would do that,
maybe you didn't.

34:18.020 --> 34:21.580
If you did, that means you baked those
cookies and set that plate there...

34:21.760 --> 34:23.449
...deliberately, purposefully...

34:23.620 --> 34:27.650
...which means that you're sitting there
also deliberately, purposefully.

34:28.659 --> 34:30.560
What did you do with Sati?

34:31.260 --> 34:35.830
"Cookies need love
like everything does."

34:37.840 --> 34:39.360
You are a bastard.

34:40.139 --> 34:42.510
You would know, Mom.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.699
Do what you're here to do.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.210
Yes, ma'am.

35:35.960 --> 35:40.400
I really wish I could help, but I just...
I don't remember any of it.

35:42.100 --> 35:46.000
What about the cuts on your arms?
Those cuts are more than one day old.

35:46.610 --> 35:49.200
Yeah, definitely.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.670
You're right about that, sir.

35:52.180 --> 35:55.510
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.910
But why would I do something
like that to myself?

36:00.090 --> 36:04.920
Unless, of course, I wasn't myself.

36:05.090 --> 36:09.760
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

36:14.530 --> 36:18.660
- Has this man been tested for VDTs?
- Yes, sir. It was negative.

36:19.370 --> 36:22.540
But he is showing a lot
of unusual neural activity.

36:22.710 --> 36:26.040
Some cross-synaptic firing,
as well as signs of recent trauma...

36:26.210 --> 36:30.010
...with fresh fibrotic scarring
throughout the cortex.

36:30.380 --> 36:35.010
I want the truth. I don't care
what it takes. Make him remember.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.040
Sir, we found her.

36:58.210 --> 36:59.300
- The Logos?
- Yes, sir.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.570
About time we had
some goddamn good news.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.670
Are the thermals picking up
any signs of life?

37:35.680 --> 37:37.340
No, sir. Nothing yet.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.150
- What about the ship?
- Holographic says the hull's still intact.

37:41.320 --> 37:44.380
- Drop down and keep a man in the turret.
- Yes, sir.

37:54.730 --> 37:58.640
Get a full diagnostic on that ship
as fast as humanly possible.

38:16.390 --> 38:17.750
Careful, sir.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.430
The squids are sneaky bastards.
It could be a trap.

38:47.990 --> 38:49.920
What was that?

38:51.990 --> 38:55.090
You can put that shit away, boys.
All she needs is a jump.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.790
- Niobe.
- Morpheus.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.100
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

39:06.270 --> 39:09.110
We didn't know what happened after...

39:10.980 --> 39:14.070
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.270
I'm happy to see you too.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.050
- Did you get Neo out?
- Yes.

39:19.220 --> 39:21.380
- How did you know about that?
- The Oracle.

39:21.550 --> 39:24.150
- You saw her?
- Just before the sentinels found us.

39:24.620 --> 39:28.790
- What did she tell you?
- The same thing she always does.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.830
Exactly what I needed to hear.

39:34.530 --> 39:37.330
In 12 hours, the machines
will breach the dock walls.

39:37.640 --> 39:42.040
Every simulation we've run, we've seen
that once the machines are inside the city...

39:42.210 --> 39:44.800
...the odds of our survival
decrease dramatically.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.970
Thus, our primary objective must be...

39:47.150 --> 39:50.610
...to destroy or disable the diggers
inside the dock.

39:50.780 --> 39:55.020
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent
them from ever reaching the city.

39:55.190 --> 39:58.320
If not, the only place we will be able
to mount a defense...

39:58.490 --> 40:00.650
...will be at the entrance of the temple.

40:00.830 --> 40:03.590
It is small and will force
them into a bottleneck...

40:03.760 --> 40:06.820
...allowing us to concentrate
the remainder of our defense.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.230
We understand that you've requested
additional volunteers.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.770
That is correct.

40:11.940 --> 40:16.310
Precisely what size force are you planning
to commit to the primary dock objective?

40:16.480 --> 40:20.000
Right now, the entire APU Corps
and half the infantry.

40:20.180 --> 40:23.210
- Half the infantry?
- If it were up to me, councillor...

40:23.380 --> 40:26.650
...I'd take every man, woman and child,
put a gun in their hand...

40:26.820 --> 40:28.690
...and march them into that dock.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.620
Perhaps it is best
that it is not up to you.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.760
Time will tell, councillor.

40:34.060 --> 40:36.720
Commander, just one more question.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.160
Has there been word
from the Nebuchadnezza?

40:39.330 --> 40:42.790
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

40:42.970 --> 40:44.960
Perhaps.

40:45.140 --> 40:46.570
But we can hope.

40:46.940 --> 40:50.140
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.990
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.820
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

41:07.990 --> 41:10.290
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

41:10.830 --> 41:13.990
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.100
Kids, you stay here.

41:22.010 --> 41:24.410
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.600
- I have to.
- Why?

41:26.780 --> 41:28.940
Because I love him.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.980
I love him the same as he loves me.

41:32.150 --> 41:35.490
And if I were out there and he were here,
I know what he'd do.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.950
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

41:41.730 --> 41:45.290
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

41:45.470 --> 41:49.330
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

41:49.500 --> 41:51.630
...what would you do?

41:56.610 --> 41:58.670
Make shells.

42:09.420 --> 42:12.320
What the shit is going on over here?

42:12.490 --> 42:16.020
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

42:16.200 --> 42:18.320
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

42:18.500 --> 42:20.760
A unit volunteer, sir.

42:21.400 --> 42:25.170
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

42:25.810 --> 42:29.300
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.770
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

42:32.950 --> 42:36.070
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

42:36.580 --> 42:37.570
Okay, I'm 16.

42:37.750 --> 42:41.410
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

42:41.590 --> 42:46.390
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

42:47.060 --> 42:48.890
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.730
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

42:53.430 --> 42:58.670
You do, and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.180
Okay, charge the igniter.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.260
She lives again.

43:22.630 --> 43:25.620
You want to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

43:25.800 --> 43:29.200
Yeah. Could you clean the windshield
while you're at it?

43:34.040 --> 43:36.630
Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

43:36.810 --> 43:39.570
Looking good, except...

43:41.380 --> 43:43.440
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.810
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

43:46.990 --> 43:50.480
-What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

43:51.490 --> 43:53.480
The machines have taken Junction 21.

43:54.430 --> 43:57.520
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

43:57.700 --> 44:00.330
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

44:00.870 --> 44:05.070
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can,
then blow our EMP.

44:05.240 --> 44:09.230
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

44:10.780 --> 44:15.610
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.270
No, it's not.

44:17.450 --> 44:20.510
There's another way. A support line.

44:20.690 --> 44:24.450
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

44:24.720 --> 44:28.660
If we're lucky, we may be able to slip down
without them ever knowing.

44:28.830 --> 44:31.060
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

44:31.230 --> 44:33.320
- No one can pilot a mechanical.
- I can.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.990
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

44:35.170 --> 44:39.040
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

44:39.210 --> 44:43.840
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

44:46.310 --> 44:47.910
Hi.

44:49.550 --> 44:54.150
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.090
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

44:58.260 --> 45:00.390
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

45:00.560 --> 45:03.830
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.660
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

45:06.830 --> 45:08.530
To go where?

45:09.500 --> 45:10.870
To the machine city.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.640
I know it's difficult to understand.

45:17.810 --> 45:20.370
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.010
I still have to go.

45:22.180 --> 45:25.380
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

45:25.550 --> 45:28.250
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

45:28.420 --> 45:31.410
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.930
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

45:35.090 --> 45:37.190
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.300
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

45:40.470 --> 45:43.660
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

45:43.840 --> 45:47.670
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

45:51.380 --> 45:55.370
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

45:56.350 --> 45:59.320
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

45:59.490 --> 46:01.780
...with my ship
after that little speech.

46:01.950 --> 46:06.390
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

46:06.930 --> 46:10.520
If we leave inside the hour,
we should reach Zion as the machines do.

46:10.700 --> 46:13.260
That's as good a plan as any.

46:13.430 --> 46:17.160
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

46:22.710 --> 46:25.870
Two ships, two directions.

46:26.050 --> 46:29.240
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

46:29.880 --> 46:33.050
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.950
Then why are you doing this?

46:36.520 --> 46:38.120
I believe in him.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.980
Thank you.

46:46.900 --> 46:49.890
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

46:50.070 --> 46:52.940
To make it easier for you to remember.

46:53.570 --> 46:55.770
What if I don't want to remember?

46:56.740 --> 46:58.840
Why would you want that?

46:59.010 --> 47:02.110
What if I blew that EMP?

47:03.180 --> 47:05.080
What if I did destroy those ships...

47:05.250 --> 47:10.050
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

47:12.120 --> 47:15.090
If I did that...

47:15.260 --> 47:19.030
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

47:28.870 --> 47:33.140
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

47:40.950 --> 47:43.120
I'm ready.

47:44.220 --> 47:46.210
Trinity...

47:47.160 --> 47:49.790
...there's something I have to say.

47:52.900 --> 47:55.700
Something you need to understand.

47:56.900 --> 47:59.770
I know I'm supposed to go.

47:59.940 --> 48:02.200
But beyond that...

48:03.210 --> 48:05.640
...I don't know. I...

48:05.810 --> 48:09.750
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

48:11.520 --> 48:16.550
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

48:16.720 --> 48:20.890
Just like you knew the moment you looked
at me that I was coming with you.

48:23.900 --> 48:25.590
I'm scared, Trin.

48:25.930 --> 48:27.900
So am I.

48:28.700 --> 48:32.360
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

48:33.340 --> 48:35.430
But I'll tell you something.

48:35.610 --> 48:38.540
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

48:38.710 --> 48:41.700
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

48:44.220 --> 48:46.810
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

48:46.990 --> 48:48.510
No.

48:49.220 --> 48:50.420
Nothing.

49:03.770 --> 49:06.100
-Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.

49:06.270 --> 49:08.600
Let's move it. We are out of time.

49:08.770 --> 49:11.070
You're not leaving them anything?

49:11.240 --> 49:13.410
He said he didn't need it.

49:17.280 --> 49:20.740
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

49:21.150 --> 49:22.990
Thank you.

49:27.790 --> 49:30.730
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

49:30.900 --> 49:32.330
Me too.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.090
It was an honor, sir.

49:42.310 --> 49:44.400
No, the honor is still mine.

49:58.290 --> 50:01.350
-We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.

50:02.560 --> 50:06.160
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

50:09.870 --> 50:11.770
Bye, baby.

50:11.940 --> 50:13.770
Take good care of them.

50:35.590 --> 50:37.390
Ready?

50:45.140 --> 50:47.200
Engine's still firing.

50:47.370 --> 50:50.000
Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

51:04.120 --> 51:07.790
- I should've known he'd send his bitch first.
- Bane.

51:07.960 --> 51:11.090
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

51:11.260 --> 51:13.250
Every time, I thought it was the last.

51:13.430 --> 51:17.270
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.000
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

51:22.710 --> 51:25.370
What are you talking about?

51:25.540 --> 51:30.780
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.890
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

51:50.700 --> 51:53.370
You're gonna pay for that.

51:54.470 --> 51:57.370
- Twenty-seven kilometers to go.
-We got an emergency.

51:57.540 --> 52:00.070
- What is it, AK?
-It's Maggie, sir.

52:00.250 --> 52:02.440
She's dead, murdered.
I think it was Bane.

52:02.610 --> 52:05.110
Goddamn it.

52:07.020 --> 52:10.460
I knew it. I knew he was
out of his goddamn mind.

52:10.620 --> 52:12.390
He fired that EMP.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.220
Goddamn it, I should have
beaten it out of him.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.330
We searched the whole ship, captain.
He ain't here.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.330
- I know where he is.
- The Logos.

52:24.970 --> 52:26.730
- We gotta go back.
- Too late.

52:26.910 --> 52:29.840
- What if they need our help?
- It's too dangerous.

52:30.010 --> 52:31.910
- Why?
- Because if he's killed them...

52:32.080 --> 52:33.670
...he'll control another EMP.

52:35.180 --> 52:39.020
At this point, they're on their own.
Just like us.

52:40.590 --> 52:42.280
Mr. Anderson.

52:43.160 --> 52:47.090
I see you are as predictable in this world
as you are in the other.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.120
- What?
- He's out of his mind.

52:49.290 --> 52:52.230
It might appear that way.
But Mr. Anderson and I know...

52:52.400 --> 52:55.300
...that appearances can be deceiving.

52:55.470 --> 52:59.300
Confused, Mr. Anderson?
It'll all become clear in a moment.

52:59.470 --> 53:02.700
Thank you for bringing me the gun.
You can set it down there.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.930
Don't do it.

53:05.110 --> 53:09.340
- Shoot. Shoot now.
- Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.780
Do it. If you don't, he'll kill us both.

53:13.890 --> 53:17.950
Look at him. He knows
he should do it, but he won't.

53:18.120 --> 53:21.120
- He can't.
- Do it.

53:28.730 --> 53:32.170
Back away from the gun
and turn around.

53:39.240 --> 53:40.510
Let her go.

53:53.690 --> 53:56.720
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

53:56.900 --> 54:01.060
We've been here before,
you and I, remember?

54:01.230 --> 54:04.860
I do. I think of nothing else.

54:09.410 --> 54:12.540
- Who are you?
- Still don't recognize me?

54:13.710 --> 54:18.210
I admit, it is difficult to even think
encased in this rotting piece of meat.

54:18.380 --> 54:24.720
The stink of it filling every breath,
a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

54:26.860 --> 54:28.790
Disgusting.

54:28.960 --> 54:34.700
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

54:40.040 --> 54:43.370
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

54:46.480 --> 54:50.850
Yes. That's it, Mr. Anderson.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.980
Look past the flesh.

54:53.150 --> 54:58.490
Look through the soft gelatin of these
dull cow eyes and see your enemy.

55:00.590 --> 55:03.590
- No.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

55:03.960 --> 55:06.860
- It can't be.
- There's nowhere I can't go.

55:07.030 --> 55:09.930
There is nowhere I won't find you.

55:10.100 --> 55:14.130
- It's impossible.
- Not impossible.

55:14.740 --> 55:16.260
Inevitable.

55:18.110 --> 55:20.080
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

55:20.250 --> 55:21.940
This is it. It's gotta be.

56:07.490 --> 56:08.650
Oh, no.

56:26.810 --> 56:30.710
I wish you could see yourself,
Mr. Anderson.

56:35.190 --> 56:37.420
Blind messiah.

56:41.690 --> 56:44.990
You're a symbol for all of your kind,
Mr. Anderson.

56:47.870 --> 56:49.990
Helpless.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.570
Pathetic.

56:57.440 --> 57:01.780
Just waiting to be put out
of your misery.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.520
I can see you.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.190
It's not over, Mr. Anderson.

57:20.370 --> 57:22.270
It's not over.

57:35.680 --> 57:39.120
- Trinity!
- Neo.

57:40.650 --> 57:42.120
Neo.

57:45.060 --> 57:48.250
Oh, no. Your eyes.

57:48.430 --> 57:50.590
I'll be okay.

57:51.900 --> 57:54.090
It's all right, Trin.

57:55.800 --> 57:58.740
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

58:05.340 --> 58:08.470
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

58:08.650 --> 58:12.310
They can't know we don't have an EMP.
They'll have to attack in waves.

58:12.480 --> 58:17.150
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.
Order the APUs into position.

58:17.320 --> 58:18.810
Yes, sir.

58:48.690 --> 58:51.380
Come on, move.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.180
All right!

59:25.360 --> 59:27.190
This is it.

59:27.360 --> 59:32.420
Now, you all know me,
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

59:33.170 --> 59:37.030
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

59:37.200 --> 59:42.660
All I ask is, if we have
to give these bastards our lives...

59:42.840 --> 59:45.710
...we give them hell before we do!

59:45.940 --> 59:47.880
Yeah!

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.560
- You scared, Charra?
- Shit, yeah.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.120
But I'll make you a deal.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.830
You keep loading, I keep shooting.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.940
Deal.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.410
- Holy Christ, would you look at that.
- Quiet.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.790
- How far to the opening?
- 1.4 kilometers.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.660
- We're still generating too hot a field.
- Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:40.590
- Give me full manual. Drop down four pads.
- It'll bottom out.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.940
- Easy, baby.
- Seven hundred meters.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:59.140
If we can just get close enough...

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.020
Six hundred meters.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.790
There.

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:16.930
Shit!

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.710
- Jig's up, here they come.
- Give me full power.

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:24.670
Man the gun turrets,
every goddamn one of them. Go!

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.510
Ghost, you're the best gunner,
go with them. Morpheus, take his place.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.330
I'm coming, baby.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.140
Here they come.

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:07.580
-Slow down, this ain't theLogos.
- Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.390
Holy Christ, I didn't know
this ship could do that.

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.770
Breach! The dock is breached!

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.760
Knuckle up!

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.680
For Zion!

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.550
Shit.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.520
Come on, let's go.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:14.660
Knuckle up!

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:31.150
Reload!

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:34.790
Reload nine!

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.760
Go, go! Move, move!

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:56.800
Watch your left!

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.110
Don't let them through!

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:04.670
Zuka!

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.420
Oh, my God.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:00.660
Where the hell's my infantry?
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.870
Dig this!

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.370
Oh, shit!

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:04.430
- Bogey two at the breach point!
- Goddamn it!

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.620
Shit, she's got a fat ass.

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:45.370
- Keep them off me!
- Christ, there's a shitstorm of them.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.900
- You see that?
- They're after the radio. Stop them!

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.010
Damn it!

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.310
Yeah.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.920
Grab my belt.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.800
Just give me one clean shot.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:28.770
Damn it!

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.130
Charra!

01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:00.810
- I got incoming!
- We got a dock full of incoming!

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.450
- Yes, sir. But this is different, sir.
- What?

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.810
I think it's one of ours, sir.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.950
- That's impossible.
- Holographics are trying to confirm.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.850
Contact them.
I want access codes.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.550
We're trying, sir.
There's no response.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.620
It's a trick. That's not one of ours,
it can't be.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.600
That's a mechanical line.
No one can pilot mechanical.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.110
- Forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.
- Thirty degrees, 80.

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:41.180
- Lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent.
- Sixty degrees.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.050
- Shit! Come on, keep up!
- I'm trying!

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.710
Sir, holographic confirms.
It's the Hammer,sir.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.580
How can that be?

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.740
It's under attack, sustaining damage.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.720
At its present velocity,
it'll reach Gate Three in 12 minutes.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.220
Their EMP could take out every sentinel.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:23.530
It'd take out more than that.
It'll wipe out our defense system.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:25.920
We blow an EMP inside,
we lose the dock.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.400
Sir, we already lost the dock.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:33.900
Open the gate.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.940
Gate Three is not responding!
We've taken critical damage, sir!

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.340
We've lost control!
We can't open it!

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.450
There's the exit.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.080
On my mark, give me full power
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:59.330
Full power...

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.930
...ninety degrees.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.570
Now!

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.070
Hold on, baby.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:24.550
Goddamn, woman, you can drive.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.710
We ain't home yet.
What about the gate?

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.850
Sentinels are inside the dock.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.590
Are we too late?

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:05.860
- How many APUs are operational?
- Thirteen, sir.

01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:08.020
Get me the one closest to Gate Three.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.790
Reload!

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.190
He's pissing metal.

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:44.190
Go!

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.050
Go!

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.740
Heads up! They're coming around!

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:38.280
Behind you!

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.670
It's jammed!

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.140
Forget it, kid! Get out of here!

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.910
Got it!

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.280
Captain Mifune.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.320
Oh, no.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.150
They're coming.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.120
They're coming.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.690
The Hammer.

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:50.630
What?

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:53.830
You have to open that gate.

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.260
Cut the counterweights.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.770
You can do it.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.330
Hurry. There's no time.

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:06.140
Captain...

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:08.680
...I didn't finish the training program.

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:13.680
Neither did I.

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.170
- Lock that down!
- Kill the feeder!

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.700
We won't make it.
We gotta blow the EMP now.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.970
Come on, someone, please.

01:18:59.730 --> 01:19:01.560
Keep the weight forward.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.360
Light as a feather.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.730
Holographic reports Captain Mifune's APU
is up and moving to Gate Three.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.810
Don't over-squeeze the trigger.

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:34.520
Mifune's APU just reached Gate Three.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.500
- How much time?
- Two minutes to impact.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.000
- Captain Mifune, do you copy?
- I think his radio is down, sir.

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:43.640
Mifune...

01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:45.430
...this is Lock.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.510
I don't know if you can hear me,
but if you can...

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.010
... theHammer's two minutes away.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.780
You've got two minutes, captain,
to get that gate open.

01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:58.380
Link.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.590
Get to the main deck!
Charge the EMP!

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.860
Do it, kid.

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:46.800
Neo. I believe.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.870
- Yes!
- Can we make it?

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:01.310
We ain't come this far.

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.730
Almost home, almost home.

01:21:35.150 --> 01:21:36.350
Burn it, Link!

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.850
- You did it.
- No.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:05.240
We did it.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.250
You're a hell of a pilot.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.220
Some things in this world never change.

01:22:14.490 --> 01:22:15.930
But some things do?

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.160
Luckily...

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.260
...some things do.

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:34.240
Link!

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.570
- Zee? Zee!
- Link!

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:46.390
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:49.080
I made a promise.

01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:59.270
You did wear it.

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:04.570
Are you kidding?
I'm never gonna take it off.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.310
Three captains, one ship.

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:20.480
I'll assume the other ships were lost
under equally pointless circumstances.

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.280
Good to see you too, Jason.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.790
The Council's waiting to hear
an explanation.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:29.090
Forgive me for not attending,
but I have to try to salvage this debacle.

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:32.430
Did I miss something?
I thought we saved the dock.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.470
That's the problem with you people.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.200
You can't think but five minutes
in front of you.

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:41.070
That EMP knocked out almost every piece
of hardware and every APU.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.210
If I were the machines,
I'd send every sentinel here now.

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:48.140
Save the dock, captain?
You handed it to them on a silver platter.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.880
Come on, get it cut.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.790
The bridge is clear.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.330
Do you hear that?

01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:07.190
Get that cable run!

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:11.210
- I want the system back online!
- It's the dock. They've got incoming.

01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:14.880
Order everyone to fall back.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.740
Seal the shaft. Now.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.180
Move it!

01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:25.150
Oh, my God.

01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:35.490
- All clear.
- Do it.

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.860
- Go! Come on! Run!
- Go!

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.740
Your move.

01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:58.580
So you gave them your ship?

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:03.190
- That is correct, councillor, I did.
- Knowing what he planned to do with it?

01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.690
The Oracle said nothing of this?

01:25:07.730 --> 01:25:12.230
She told me Neo would need my help,
and I would choose to help him or not.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.060
But what hope can a single vessel have
against their entire defense system?

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.440
None. It's completely impossible.
But he wouldn't listen.

01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:24.910
He wouldn't even take any ammunition.
He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.880
No, he wasn't.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.420
Neo is doing what he believes
he must do.

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:37.020
I don't know if what he's doing is right.
I don't know...

01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:39.820
...if he'll reach the machine city.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.230
And if he does, I don't know
what he can do to save us.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.300
But I do know that as long as there is
a single breath in his body...

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.800
...he will not give up.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.600
And neither can we.

01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:03.450
Temperature's dropping.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.290
Here we go.

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:49.560
We're over the fields, aren't we?

01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:52.300
How do you know that?

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.940
I can feel them.

01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:05.310
Over there.

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:10.050
There's our path. Can you see it?
Three lines.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:11.480
Power lines.

01:27:12.490 --> 01:27:14.250
Follow them.

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:33.070
What are they doing?

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.940
I don't know.

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:36.840
Lieutenant?

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.190
Goddamn it.

01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:55.860
What do we do now?

01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:02.660
It is now a matter of time.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.930
The machines will breach
the walls of this city.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.740
I recommend that the Council join the other
non-military personnel inside the temple.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.780
How long do we have?

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.950
Two hours. Maybe less.

01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:22.890
My men have fortified the entrance
with enough artillery to make our last stand.

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:27.290
Beyond that, there isn't anything more
I can do.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.230
Commander, do you think that
we have any chance of surviving?

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:35.400
If I were you, I wouldn't
ask me that question.

01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:37.940
I would ask him.

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:42.470
- Why?
- He's the one who believes in miracles.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.280
There. Those mountains.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.180
That's it.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.300
- Do you see what's out there?
- Yes.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.460
If you tell me we'll make it,
I'll believe you.

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:05.290
We'll make it.

01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:10.000
We have to.

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.980
Sentinels.

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:37.720
There's too many!

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:55.670
Gotcha!

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.610
- I need help here!
- I can't beat them.

01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:01.220
- What do we do?
- Go up, over them.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.480
- What?
- The sky! It's the only way.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.190
Then up we go.

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:45.290
Beautiful.

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.810
Pump the igniter. The ship will start.

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.700
Again. Slowly.

01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:24.160
Now!

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:51.180
Trin?

01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:55.030
Trinity?

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.760
Trinity?

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.100
- I'm here.
- Where?

01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:02.500
Here.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.210
We made it.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.790
You said we would.

01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:22.520
It's unbelievable, Trin.

01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:25.220
Light everywhere.

01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:28.400
Like the whole thing was built of light.

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.230
I wish you could see what I see.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.870
You've already shown me so much.

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:40.440
What is it, Trinity?
What's wrong?

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.340
I can't go with you, Neo.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.810
I've gone as far as I can.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.450
What?

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.890
Oh, no.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.490
Oh, no. No, no.

01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:58.890
It's all right.

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.890
It's time.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.970
I've done all that I could do.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.570
Now you have to do the rest.

01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:12.430
You have to finish it.

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.940
You have to save Zion.

01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:17.110
I can't.

01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:20.880
- Not without you.
- Yes, you can.

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:23.110
You will.

01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:27.280
I believe it. I always have.

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.390
Trinity.

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:37.100
Trinity, you can't die.

01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:41.230
You can't.

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.130
You can't.

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:45.430
Yes, I can.

01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:51.050
You brought me back once.

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:55.340
But not this time.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.120
Do you remember...

01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:07.860
...on that roof, after you caught me...

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:11.230
...the last thing I said to you?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.490
You said, "I'm sorry."

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.930
I wish I hadn't.

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:24.280
That was my last thought.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.520
I wished I had one more chance...

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.650
...to say what really mattered.

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:38.060
To say how much I loved you.

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:43.870
How grateful I was for every moment
I was with you.

01:35:46.670 --> 01:35:51.610
But by the time I knew how to say
what I wanted to, it was too late.

01:35:57.650 --> 01:36:00.170
But you brought me back.

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.350
You gave me my wish.

01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.720
One more chance to say
what I really wanted to say.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.270
Kiss me.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.000
Once more...

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.110
...kiss me.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:58.600
Get that ammunition where it belongs!
You got one chance to get this right.

01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:01.070
Get that damn thing mounted!

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.640
- Hurry.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:37:23.530 --> 01:37:24.900
Neo...

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.600
...if you're gonna do something,
do it quick.

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.490
I only ask to say
what I've come to say.

01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:42.500
After that, do what you want,
and I won't try and stop you.

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.970
Speak.

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:51.680
The program Smith has grown
beyond your control.

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:55.250
He will spread through this city
as he spread through the Matrix.

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.750
You cannot stop him.

01:39:58.850 --> 01:40:01.190
- But I can.
- We don't need you!

01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:04.520
We need nothing!

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:09.530
If that's true, then I've made a mistake,
and you should kill me now.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.500
What do you want?

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.170
Peace.

01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:46.900
What are they doing?

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.470
What are you doing?

01:40:57.650 --> 01:40:59.580
Morpheus!

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.930
And if you fail?

01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.170
I won't.

01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:53.190
Neo.

01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.060
He fights for us.

01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:39.680
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:41.980
We missed you.

01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:49.020
You like what I've done with the place?

01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:51.320
It ends tonight.

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.250
I know it does. I've seen it.

01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:59.200
That's why the rest of me
is just going to enjoy the show...

01:42:59.370 --> 01:43:03.000
...because we already know
that I'm the one that beats you.

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.220
Can you feel it, Mr. Anderson...

01:44:58.390 --> 01:45:00.820
...closing in on you?

01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:03.150
Oh, I can.

01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:08.620
I really should thank you for it.
After all, it was your life...

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.390
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:16.330
The purpose of life is to end.

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.120
Why, Mr. Anderson?

01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:58.230
Why, why, why?

01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:59.620
Why do you do it?

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.390
Why? Why get up?

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:04.360
Why keep fighting?

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:08.390
Do you believe you're fighting
for something?

01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:11.230
For more than your survival?

01:49:11.410 --> 01:49:14.710
Can you tell me what it is?
Do you even know?

01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:19.910
Is it freedom or truth?

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.450
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:26.020
Illusions, Mr. Anderson.
Vagaries of perception.

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:29.480
Temporary constructs
of a feeble human intellect...

01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:34.490
...trying desperately to justify an existence
that is without meaning or purpose!

01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:38.120
And all of them as artificial
as the Matrix itself...

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:44.430
...although only a human mind could
invent something as insipid as love.

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:50.400
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.
You must know it by now.

01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:53.780
You can't win.
It's pointless to keep fighting.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.780
Why, Mr. Anderson, why?
Why do you persist?

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:05.290
Because I choose to.

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:13.320
This is my world! My world!

01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:39.720
Wait.

01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:42.050
I've seen this.

01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:45.560
This is it. This is the end.

01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:51.130
Yes. You were laying right there,
just like that.

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:53.630
And I...

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:59.640
I stand here, right here,
and I'm supposed to say something.

01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:01.470
I say:

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:05.170
"Everything that has a beginning
has an end, Neo."

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:17.650
What? What did I just say?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.870
No, no. This isn't right.
This can't be right.

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.000
Get away from me!

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.610
What are you afraid of?

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:39.710
It's a trick.

01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:42.610
You were right, Smith.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.380
You were always right.

01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:50.350
It was inevitable.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.750
Is it over?

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.160
Oh, no, no, no.

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:58.850
No, it's not fair.

01:54:53.150 --> 01:54:55.480
It is done.

01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:29.750
It doesn't make sense.

01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:35.350
He did it.

01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:38.350
He saved us.

01:55:38.630 --> 01:55:40.790
He saved us.

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.630
It's over! He did it! He did it!

01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:46.200
He did it! It's over!

01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:48.860
It's over! He did it! He did it!

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.560
- What is it? What happened?
- Sir, he did it, sir. Neo, he did it.

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:54.210
- Did what?
- He ended the war.

01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.310
The machines, they're gone.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:59.810
The war is over, sir. The war is over.

01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:04.820
Zion! Zion!

01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:06.750
Zion, it's over!

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.550
It's over!

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.390
The war is over!

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.390
The war is over!

01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:38.690
I have imagined this moment...

01:56:39.190 --> 01:56:41.490
...for so long.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.160
Is this real?

01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:58.770
Neo, wherever you are...

01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:01.830
...thank you.

01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:47.020
Good morning.

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.210
Well, now. Ain't this a surprise.

01:58:12.610 --> 01:58:14.780
You played a very dangerous game.

01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:17.210
Change always is.

01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:21.120
Just how long do you think
this peace is going to last?

01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:24.690
As long as it can.

01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:29.950
What about the others?

01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:33.030
What others?

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:34.860
The ones that want out.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:37.730
Obviously, they will be freed.

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:39.970
I have your word?

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:43.910
What do you think I am? Human?

01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:59.490
Oracle!

01:59:06.330 --> 01:59:08.500
We were afraid we might not find you.

01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:11.330
Everything's okay now.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.600
Look, look.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:16.610
Just look at that.

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:19.910
Beautiful.

01:59:20.850 --> 01:59:23.250
Did you do that?

01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:25.750
For Neo.

01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:28.080
That's nice.

01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.950
I know he'd love it.

01:59:30.590 --> 01:59:32.580
Will we ever see him again?

01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:35.930
I suspect so.

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.830
Someday.

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.400
Did you always know?

01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:47.870
Oh, no. No, I didn't.

01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:50.940
But I believed.

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.280
I believed.
