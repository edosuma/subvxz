WEBVTT

01:04.564 --> 01:06.483
Hey, did you hear all that?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.778
MIKE:
<i>I heard enough to know she saved your ass.</i>

01:09.861 --> 01:10.695
JIMMY:
So...

01:12.197 --> 01:14.324
So, what happens next?

01:15.325 --> 01:16.576
MIKE:
<i>We'll see.</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:24.125
Who was that?

01:26.419 --> 01:29.297
Uh, that was, um...

01:31.049 --> 01:32.717
That's the guy who saved my life.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.096
Kim, I got the money. I was on my way back.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.891
I thought I was home free.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.811
And I was...

01:43.812 --> 01:45.563
ambushed by, uh...

01:46.564 --> 01:48.858
a gang.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.277
A cartel gang.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.573
And they took the money,

01:55.657 --> 01:57.242
and one of them...

01:59.285 --> 02:01.412
put a gun to my head.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.168
Then that guy on the phone, he showed up.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.004
He shot them with a sniper rifle.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.967
He killed all of them.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.220
All but one.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.013
One guy got away.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.519
And later, I helped him to get that one too.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.396
Kim, I...

02:26.479 --> 02:28.189
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.024
Oh, my God.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.317
Oh, my God.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.825
I think we should get out of here.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.880
Kind of assumed we'd be staying at a Motel 6
or the nail salon.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.632
It's better to have more people around.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.170
How are your shoulders?

03:33.463 --> 03:37.216
Should I put something on them
or would that just make it worse?

03:38.426 --> 03:39.469
I think...

03:40.470 --> 03:42.472
I'm, uh...

03:46.809 --> 03:48.686
Am I bad for you?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.525
Are you bad for me?

03:56.319 --> 03:58.321
I got you into this.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.282
What happened tonight.

04:02.367 --> 04:06.246
None of this would've happened
if you weren't with me.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.228
You crossed a line.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.817
You're not gonna do it again.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.115
Yeah.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.161
It's been a long day.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.540
Come on, make room.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.642
Good night.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.657
Well?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.077
He went over the border and kept going.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.246
Looks to be headed for his place in Chihuahua.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.791
He should be there in a few hours.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.418
-Good.
-There's a wrinkle.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.170
He took Varga with him.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.214
Why?

06:22.298 --> 06:25.802
If he thought Varga was working for you,
he would've killed him on the spot.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.640
If I had to guess
I'd say Varga is up for a promotion.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.726
Can you communicate with Varga?

06:33.810 --> 06:37.230
Salamanca's place is in the middle of nowhere.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.649
Landlines and SAT phones only.

06:40.817 --> 06:41.984
A technical issue.

06:43.152 --> 06:47.156
The way things stand,
he's gonna get caught in the crossfire.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.660
I'm thinking we should find a way
to pull him out of there.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.253
And tip our hand?

07:03.673 --> 07:06.217
MIKE:
He's earned some consideration.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.606
Does Varga know
there's going to be an assassination?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.943
No one's told him,
but he can make a pretty damn good guess.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.404
Perhaps...

07:27.530 --> 07:29.574
there is a way to make use of this situation.

07:30.867 --> 07:35.079
The men I've chosen for this are highly skilled.
They're the best in their business.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.623
But the one thing they do not have...

07:38.791 --> 07:41.335
is a man on the inside.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.784
MAN :
<i>Someone's coming. SUV.</i>

08:13.868 --> 08:15.745
<i>Don't recognize it.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:29.068
Nachito, come on over, don't be shy.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.782
I'd like to introduce you all to Ignacio.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.535
He's going to be staying with us a while.
He's a friend of mine.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.495
These, these are my people.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.747
Yolanda, she is the best cook in all of Chihuahua.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.710
You're gonna eat like you have never eaten
before in your life.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.879
Cecilio, he takes care of all of my gardens.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.968
His tomatoes are the best ever.

09:54.051 --> 09:59.557
Uh, Tito, Miguel, Herardo, Raul,
and all the rest of these fools.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.184
They're supposed to be guarding this place,

10:02.268 --> 10:07.064
but, uh, I just keep them around
because they're so pretty, right?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.194
And what about you?

10:13.529 --> 10:18.075
Huh? Am I going to have to carry
my own things or what?

10:18.159 --> 10:18.993
Sorry...

10:19.076 --> 10:21.412
Get going, asshole!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.208
Hey, listen. Welcome.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.544
Smile. You're in my house, man.
Come on. Come in.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.328
Hey, did you pack anything with aloe in it?

11:02.411 --> 11:04.413
Oh, morning.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.040
Morning.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.875
I didn't wake you, did I?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.544
No, you're going to court?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.672
Yeah, I have a hearing at 10:00.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.716
And I wanna see if I can catch Oakley
before I go in.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.054
You seemed like you could use the sleep.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.931
Heh. Yeah.

11:33.359 --> 11:37.488
Hey, I think I might have a better idea.
What if we spend the whole day here, you know?

11:37.571 --> 11:42.368
This place has got everything.
It's got a heated pool, a swim-up bar, a hot tub.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.286
Well, I didn't pack a swimsuit.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.624
Neither did I, there's a shop downstairs
and we could stop in at the spa.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.835
You know? And get couple's massages.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.294
With your sunburn?

11:52.378 --> 11:53.337
Yeah.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.799
Or a seaweed wrap, you know?

11:56.882 --> 12:00.511
And then we'll just go hang in the co-ed sauna,
you know?

12:00.594 --> 12:03.055
-Sweat out some toxins and, uh...
-Mm.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.475
Oh, 24-hour room service.

12:06.559 --> 12:11.814
Hey, what could be more luxurious than
to spend a whole day being totally pampered

12:11.897 --> 12:14.191
and end it all with a midnight cheeseburger?

12:14.275 --> 12:16.610
Come on, hey, don't we deserve this?

12:16.694 --> 12:19.196
Jimmy, I have clients.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.573
Yeah.

12:20.656 --> 12:24.034
You just quit Schweikart. I mean, take one day off.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.996
The clerks love you.
They will give you continuance on anything.

12:27.079 --> 12:31.459
Hey, Kim. We already sprang for this place.
I'm just saying, let's take advantage.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.044
You know, let's John and Yoko this sucker.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.005
You don't think it's safe.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.801
Probably it is, but...

12:42.052 --> 12:47.892
Here's the thing. Lalo has guys, right?
So it doesn't really matter where he is.

12:47.975 --> 12:52.062
If he finds one loose end,
all it takes is a phone call.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.900
Do you know something you're not telling me?

12:55.983 --> 13:01.864
No. No, I don't. But what's the harm
in being a little cautious?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.824
What about tomorrow?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.951
Or the next day?

13:06.035 --> 13:08.412
Jimmy, what about next week?

13:09.413 --> 13:10.873
I don't know.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.419
All right.

13:17.004 --> 13:22.343
Then the way I see it, we just need to keep
our eyes open and get on with our lives.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.553
Kim, listen--

13:24.637 --> 13:28.432
The courthouse... It's three blocks from here.

13:28.516 --> 13:34.230
It's full of cops,
police headquarters is right next door.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.773
Jimmy...

13:39.068 --> 13:40.986
it's gonna be fine.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.738
I'll see you later.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.143
Hey, it's me. I want an update.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.648
Bullshit. Ha! I wanna know what's going on.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.026
Not good enough. No.

14:21.110 --> 14:25.739
You know what? You...
We are gonna talk about this face to face.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.701
You tell me where you are,
I will come to you--

14:28.784 --> 14:30.160
Hello?

14:39.503 --> 14:44.383
That means we won.
The state dropped the charges.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.635
No, no, no. You don't have
to appear in court again.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.763
Now we both have the morning off.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.350
Uh-huh.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.312
Mm-hm.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.566
I'm sorry, Mary, you know what?
I have to go.

15:00.649 --> 15:04.486
But call if you have any questions, anytime. Okay.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.404
Yes, bye.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.907
Hey, Grant? You got a minute?

15:09.033 --> 15:09.867
How's it going?

15:09.950 --> 15:10.784
GRANT:
Let's see.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.955
I have half an hour to plead out four taggers
and a homeless guy

15:15.039 --> 15:18.959
who tried to stuff a dozen hard-boiled eggs
down his pants at a Ruby Tuesday's.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.337
Life in the public defender's office.
How's your day so far?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.256
Uh, I got some holes in my schedule
I'm looking to fill.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.507
Holes?

15:25.591 --> 15:29.345
You're telling me you're billing, what, 250 an hour
and you got holes in your schedule?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.805
If I were you, I'd keep things airtight.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.475
I'd like some more PD overflow.

15:34.558 --> 15:38.520
Go talk to the contract liaison,
and Gloria will set you up.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.565
Grant, the thing is, I know I'm not supposed
to choose the cases I get,

15:41.649 --> 15:45.986
but I'm looking for something specific.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.990
Specific? Like what?

15:50.824 --> 15:52.159
Uh...

15:53.160 --> 15:57.039
I just wanna make sure I'm spending my time
where it'll do the most good.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.625
I gotcha.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.544
So plain old indigents
are not good enough for you.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.131
You want the clients that will get you,
you know, in here.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.218
Grant, just let me have some tricky ones.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.972
Think of all the extra time you'll have
to spend on your egg-stuffers.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.142
If I were going to go along with that,
you'd have to take felonies.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.060
Sure.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.145
We're talking cases that are headed for trial.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.232
Nothing you can plead out
in three hot minutes with your friendly ADA.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.026
I'll take 20. Today.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.822
Twenty? That's your offer?

16:29.905 --> 16:32.366
Twenty felonies?

16:32.449 --> 16:33.534
Yes.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.744
Hold this.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.290
Walk with me.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.211
Hey, Dana, any chance you can tell the judge
I'm running 15 minutes late?

16:46.255 --> 16:50.426
Oh, I gotta warn you. Right now we're backed up
like an outhouse at Woodstock.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.477
So possession raps are here.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.479
Possession with intent.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.440
These are all assault.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.733
Wait.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.610
No. Assault's on the other side of this shelf.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.988
All of these cases are pending?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.656
Pretty much.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.576
Had more burnouts than usual this last quarter.

17:15.659 --> 17:20.372
That's what I call taking that private firm gig.
Getting that sweet company car.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.791
Burning rubber on your way out.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.506
Public intoxication, petty larceny,

17:29.590 --> 17:31.675
destruction of property,

17:31.759 --> 17:33.177
DUI,

17:33.260 --> 17:34.678
trespassing,

17:36.013 --> 17:37.598
involuntary manslaughter,

17:39.016 --> 17:40.267
immigration,

17:41.477 --> 17:43.854
domestic violence.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.735
Or, if you feel like you do want...

17:51.236 --> 17:53.363
Juveniles.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742
Go ahead, have a look around.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.203
Let me know which ones you want
so we can kick them over.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.996
I'll get you a box.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.730
Flashlight.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.862
When you talk to the boss, you call him Don.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.867
He asks you a question, you tell the truth.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.538
Fewest words you can.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.334
If he likes you, he's gonna give you a bump up.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.046
Hey.

18:52.047 --> 18:56.218
Don't think I don't see you, all right?
I see you. I do.

18:56.301 --> 19:00.305
Right now, steady is what we need, you know?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.434
And if he doesn't like me?

19:07.271 --> 19:09.481
Ah, you'll be fine.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.941
Give me the socket wrench.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.830
-Um, I gotta hit the head.
-Yeah, yeah.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.540
Straight back to the left.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.251
Hey, don't get any grease on my sink, eh?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.267
Yeah?

19:45.350 --> 19:50.314
MAN : <i>There's a gate at the back</i>
<i>of Salamanca's place. 3:00 a.m. tonight.</i>

19:50.397 --> 19:54.193
<i>Unlock it. Open it.</i>
<i>Get the hell away from there.</i>

19:54.276 --> 19:55.694
Who are you?

19:56.862 --> 19:59.531
<i>3:00 a.m. Got it?</i>

20:01.491 --> 20:03.744
You're gonna do this clean, right?

20:03.827 --> 20:07.372
He's got at least seven guys here,
but there's also a couple of old folks,

20:07.456 --> 20:10.500
and they've never done anything to anybody.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.268
After that, I want you both to be thinking
about how to parse out discovery.

20:28.352 --> 20:33.148
It's gonna be document heavy,
so let's be mindful of resource management.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.691
Howard.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.276
-Kim.
-Good to see you.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.486
What floor?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.404
Three, please.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.952
Have you met my associates?
Paul Sheppard and Michelle Avila.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.119
I don't think so, hi.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.163
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

20:50.207 --> 20:53.293
Guys, this is Kim Wexler.
She's an HHM alum.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.046
And now heads up banking
at Schweikart and Cokely.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.881
Nice to meet you both.

21:01.593 --> 21:06.431
I'm actually not at Schweikart anymore.
Or in banking, for that matter.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.517
Really?

21:08.600 --> 21:09.851
KIM:
As of yesterday.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.229
Take care, Howard.

21:15.899 --> 21:19.403
Kim! Kim! Hang on a sec.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.949
Out of curiosity, where did you land?
Reeves and Green?

21:24.032 --> 21:25.492
I'm out on my own again.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.453
Rich let you go?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.706
It wasn't up to him. I left.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.249
What about Mesa Verde?

21:32.332 --> 21:34.584
I advised them to stay with Schweikart.

21:35.627 --> 21:36.962
Um...

21:37.045 --> 21:40.048
I know it's a personal question, Kim,
but can I ask why?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.676
-That is personal. And I have a--
-Spare me a minute.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.887
Please. It's important.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.518
KIM:
What's up?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.940
I wasn't gonna say anything.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.111
Last time I tried to get something off my chest,
it didn't go very well.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.654
I just think...

22:03.655 --> 22:07.034
before you make any big changes in your life...

22:08.160 --> 22:10.954
There's something about Jimmy
you ought to hear.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.334
Okay.

22:17.169 --> 22:22.841
A little while ago, I offered Jimmy a job at HHM.
I'm guessing he didn't mention it to you.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.052
Huh.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.555
He said he had to think about it.

22:29.890 --> 22:34.853
But then the very next night,
he threw bowling balls over my front gate.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.189
Bowling balls?

22:37.272 --> 22:39.149
Someone could've been really hurt.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.526
More or less destroyed my car.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.404
Then, a couple of weeks later,
I'm having lunch with Cliff Main.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.908
And I'm accosted by two prostitutes.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.911
Actual prostitutes.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.205
Jimmy had sent them to make a scene.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.291
I confronted Jimmy about it.

22:56.374 --> 22:58.460
And after some hemming and hawing...

22:59.461 --> 23:01.254
he all but confessed.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.514
-And that's it?
-Mm-hm.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.766
Sorry--

23:14.976 --> 23:17.187
Uh, ahem.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.396
Howard.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.650
You really had me going there.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.318
Laugh if you want,

23:24.486 --> 23:27.489
but no person in their right mind
would behave the way Jimmy has.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.951
We are talking about someone
who is not in control of himself.

23:31.952 --> 23:36.832
You and I both know it makes no sense
to drop a client like Mesa Verde.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.417
And I gotta think Jimmy had something
to do with that.

23:40.585 --> 23:44.422
Do you have any idea how insulting that is?

23:45.423 --> 23:47.467
I make my own decisions.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.802
For my own reasons.

23:48.885 --> 23:51.471
You gotta listen to me. The man needs help.

23:51.555 --> 23:55.225
Howard. I know Jimmy, and you're wrong.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.275
You know who really knew Jimmy?

24:04.276 --> 24:05.735
Chuck.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.211
Open up. Asshole!

24:25.046 --> 24:28.884
Open this door! I want to talk to you!

24:37.017 --> 24:38.185
What?

24:38.268 --> 24:41.855
You didn't think I'd find
your ultra-secret bat cave?

24:41.938 --> 24:47.652
Well, joke's on you, sucker.
I'm your attorney and you will let me in!

24:57.078 --> 24:59.873
I'm not going anywhere. I mean it.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.791
I got nowhere to be.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.960
Open up now!

25:04.044 --> 25:05.545
Hey!

25:06.755 --> 25:08.673
What the hell do you think you're doing?

25:08.757 --> 25:10.050
Ah, there he is.

25:10.133 --> 25:13.053
Not a fan of the surprise pop-in, huh?

25:13.136 --> 25:14.554
Oh, I can't imagine why.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.015
-Keep it down, I got neighbors.
-I will not keep it down.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.142
I want answers, okay?

25:19.226 --> 25:22.896
The time has come for you to level with me,
and I'm not going to leave until you do.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.481
Inside. Now.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.524
Okay, look. Look.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.735
Okay.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.489
You saved my life.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.075
Thank you for that.

25:36.576 --> 25:40.372
But from here on out,
I gotta be kept in the loop, man.

25:40.455 --> 25:46.044
It's not my fault that I got ambushed.
Why did I have to lie to Salamanca about that?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.587
Who was I lying for?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.840
Now, you gotta tell me what is happening, now!

25:50.924 --> 25:52.342
That's not your concern.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.302
Oh, come on.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.220
Listen to me.

25:55.303 --> 25:59.015
You are not blowing me off
with any "that's not the end of the story" crap.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.850
Now, just specifics!

26:00.934 --> 26:03.019
You're asking for information you can't have.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.449
If anything happens to her...

26:20.620 --> 26:24.457
I can't do this. I can't.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.588
Hmm. Hmm.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.216
All right.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.427
All right.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.639
Now, you listen, and you shut up.

26:40.849 --> 26:45.603
This man has other things on his mind,
he's not thinking about you.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.484
Lalo Salamanca is going to die...

26:51.568 --> 26:52.986
tonight.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.698
Tonight?

26:56.781 --> 26:59.492
This time tomorrow, it'll be done.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.250
Oh, okay.

27:09.669 --> 27:10.670
Now...

27:11.963 --> 27:13.923
I need you to leave.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.594
I have family coming over.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.413
ELADIO :
Very nice.

27:48.416 --> 27:52.087
Maybe a little less this time?

27:52.170 --> 27:54.089
We've had some bad luck.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.383
Luck?

27:56.466 --> 28:01.221
Don Eladio, Gustavo assures me that it's over.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.414
Look who it is!

28:27.497 --> 28:29.791
Don Eladio!

28:31.543 --> 28:36.506
I knew the Americans couldn't hold you!

28:36.589 --> 28:37.465
Bolsa.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.844
I understand it was expensive for you
to get out, was it not?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.513
Hey. You paid the gringos?

28:43.596 --> 28:45.765
I thought you would have...

28:47.225 --> 28:48.768
You know how it goes up there.

28:48.852 --> 28:52.021
But don't worry. I got my pound of flesh.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.940
What's all this?

28:54.023 --> 28:57.777
It's what Bolsa has brought me from Fring.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.778
-Ah.
-Hmm.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.029
<i>Excelente.</i>

29:00.155 --> 29:01.781
You think so?

29:01.865 --> 29:03.616
Of course!

29:04.617 --> 29:07.537
Hey, by the way...

29:08.788 --> 29:13.084
I found this key but I don't know if it's yours.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.962
I don't think so.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.547
Mm. Hmm.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.174
That's weird. But...

29:20.175 --> 29:22.093
Let's see what it opens.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.231
Oh, <i>Magnum P.I.</i>!

29:36.816 --> 29:39.235
What a beautiful baby!

29:40.278 --> 29:43.490
She's so smooth.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.532
Eh, Bolsa?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.118
-Very smooth.
ELADIO: Ha, ha.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.872
Perhaps there's...

29:50.955 --> 29:52.874
something in the trunk?

29:55.376 --> 29:56.836
Let's find out.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.796
LALO:
Don.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.424
On this model the trunk is in the front.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.677
Ah. So...

30:04.761 --> 30:06.846
It's a "frunk."

30:10.141 --> 30:11.559
Let's see.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.728
"Frunk."

30:14.813 --> 30:16.439
A present!

30:17.524 --> 30:20.068
What is this? Oh.

30:20.151 --> 30:24.489
This is the man.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.159
Right, Bolsa?

30:28.243 --> 30:31.162
This is "showmanship!"

30:34.249 --> 30:35.083
Don Eladio.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.378
I'd like you to meet Ignacio Varga.

30:38.461 --> 30:42.215
He's our new man up north.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.300
Ah.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.010
Not a Salamanca?

30:46.094 --> 30:49.597
LALO: He's been running things
since Hector got sick.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.350
He's a friend of Tuco's.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.398
Tuco. Really? Ah.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.652
You okay in there?

31:04.112 --> 31:06.531
I'm joking with you.

31:06.614 --> 31:10.994
Let's talk, you and I.
We'll get to know each other.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.127
ELADIO:
So.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.297
How do you think you'll make me money?

31:37.687 --> 31:40.690
I'm going to sell as much stuff
as you can send me.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.569
I'm gonna open up new territory.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.865
Keep the competition out.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.825
New territory?

31:52.035 --> 31:54.370
Who are you taking this territory from?

31:55.455 --> 31:56.497
To start with...

31:58.291 --> 32:00.543
Biker gangs.

32:02.045 --> 32:04.589
Biker gangs?

32:04.672 --> 32:06.215
Bikers?

32:12.347 --> 32:13.473
Hmm.

32:14.474 --> 32:18.311
So you're going to start a war

32:18.394 --> 32:21.272
with a bunch of gringo bikers?

32:21.356 --> 32:23.483
This is your plan.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.656
Don Eladio.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.326
These gangs are divided.

32:34.327 --> 32:38.957
We turn them against each other.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.166
ELADIO:
Mm-hm.

32:40.249 --> 32:46.089
Then we take them out one at a time.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.766
So you are a businessman.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.147
Ignacio Varga.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.945
What do you want?

33:10.321 --> 33:12.824
-What do I want?
-Yes.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.996
Respect.

33:19.747 --> 33:24.252
I want to make my own decisions.
Go my own way.

33:24.961 --> 33:30.174
I don't want anyone to even think of playing me.

33:30.258 --> 33:35.930
And I don't want to be looking
over my shoulder.

33:37.974 --> 33:41.853
You don't want to be looking over your shoulder?

33:44.731 --> 33:48.526
You're in the wrong business, my friend.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.698
You're all right.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.668
<i>Salud.</i>

34:32.862 --> 34:34.447
Really?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.158
Really.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.079
How do you know?

34:42.955 --> 34:44.791
I talked to my guy.

34:44.874 --> 34:50.296
-Lalo's in Mexico, and he's staying there.
-But you said he might call someone...

34:51.672 --> 34:53.091
He's not gonna do that.

34:53.174 --> 34:58.221
-Your guy? How does he know for sure?
-He's not gonna tell me, but he knows.

34:58.304 --> 35:02.266
-And you believe him?
-Yeah. I do.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.769
So, we're safe?

35:05.812 --> 35:07.271
Yeah.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.151
My God.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.779
Oh, my God.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.117
Oh, that's great.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.830
It's great, right?

35:25.581 --> 35:31.003
It's... It's... So, what's wrong? It's over.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.758
This time.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.554
There's not gonna be a next time.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.569
Kim...

35:55.653 --> 35:57.738
it's been a rough ride.

35:59.073 --> 36:02.201
I've been thinking a lot, and, um...

36:04.537 --> 36:06.789
we should probably just check out
and go home.

36:06.873 --> 36:13.421
I packed my stuff, I think I got yours too.
Just double-check.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.136
We already paid for the night.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.390
What about the spa and all that?

36:25.391 --> 36:27.643
We haven't even tried room service.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.356
Kim, don't you just wanna go home?

36:36.944 --> 36:42.074
"A veil of white cheddar draped
over coarse ground Angus beef patty,

36:42.158 --> 36:45.870
locally grown chili pepper,
house-baked sesame seed buns

36:45.953 --> 36:52.585
served with golden brown shoestring potatoes
seasoned with truffle salt."

36:54.170 --> 36:55.171
Truffle salt.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.592
I'm hungry, Jimmy.

36:59.675 --> 37:03.179
And there is nothing to eat
at home anyway, so...

37:05.765 --> 37:06.599
why not?

37:19.904 --> 37:23.532
So I ran into Howard at the courthouse today.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.995
Yeah?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.705
Told me something about...

37:31.207 --> 37:33.751
bowling balls destroying his car.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.968
Prostitutes harassing him at lunch.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.725
For what it's worth,
that all happened before we...

37:49.809 --> 37:51.143
Before we got married?

37:52.144 --> 37:53.396
Yeah.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.027
You know why Hamlin told me all that?

38:02.697 --> 38:05.199
It was for my own good.

38:06.742 --> 38:12.415
Like I'm just waiting for him
to ride up on his white horse?

38:12.498 --> 38:14.208
It's...

38:14.292 --> 38:16.627
It's all about him.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.089
It's always all about him.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.508
The guy is in love with himself.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.387
He needed to be taken down a peg.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.223
So...

38:33.144 --> 38:34.770
what's next?

38:36.522 --> 38:40.318
You went after his car.
You went after his reputation, so...

38:42.236 --> 38:46.073
I think maybe the next thing is...

38:47.616 --> 38:48.784
his hair.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.872
Right? Suppose...

38:52.955 --> 38:58.252
I'm just brainstorming here,
but suppose we slip him a mickey.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.882
And then, while he's out,
we get out the old electric clippers.

39:06.635 --> 39:08.346
Shave him bald.

39:10.139 --> 39:11.974
Nair.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.393
What?

39:16.645 --> 39:18.939
It's an old gag,

39:19.023 --> 39:23.194
but sneak into his country club
and put Nair in his shampoo bottle.

39:23.277 --> 39:25.613
-And then he takes a shower, and...
-Ha, ha.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.365
-Hair falls out. Nice.
-Yeah.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.242
Or, or, or, um...

39:30.326 --> 39:34.914
we pour a barrel of chlorine
into his swimming pool.

39:34.997 --> 39:38.000
-So then...
-Bleaches his hair and eyebrows, everything.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.668
Yes, and the eyebrows.

39:42.129 --> 39:43.923
Or. Or...

39:44.006 --> 39:48.427
KIM:
Or we break into his house,

39:48.511 --> 39:52.556
replace all the fluffy toilet paper rolls
with single ply.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.768
JIMMY: Ouch. Hit him where he lives.
-Ha, ha.

39:55.851 --> 40:01.649
JIMMY: Or, whatever tanning lotion he uses,
we replace it with sunblock.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.776
-He gets in his tanning bed and...
-Ha, ha.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.986
JIMMY:
Waste of time.

40:06.070 --> 40:06.946
KIM:
Or...

40:08.280 --> 40:09.156
Or...

40:10.616 --> 40:11.617
Or what?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.621
We'd never do it, but...

40:18.207 --> 40:20.084
Never do what?

40:21.961 --> 40:23.838
What if...

40:26.465 --> 40:29.760
What if Howard does something terrible?

40:31.345 --> 40:37.393
Like he murders a waiter
for putting butter in his cauliflower?

40:38.936 --> 40:40.980
No, I mean really bad.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.775
Like misconduct.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.611
You know, misappropriating funds or, um...

40:48.612 --> 40:50.948
bribing witnesses, something like that.

40:51.031 --> 40:54.702
You know what that would mean
for the Sandpiper case?

40:54.785 --> 40:58.581
A big class action suit?
It could tank the whole thing.

41:00.749 --> 41:03.335
Cliff Main's hair would be on fire.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.173
He'd get it settled.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.342
Pronto.

41:12.928 --> 41:13.762
JIMMY:
He would?

41:14.763 --> 41:19.477
KIM: Yeah. Think about how much
they've put into that case.

41:20.561 --> 41:24.106
Almost two years of work?

41:25.733 --> 41:28.944
If it fell apart now, they'd get nothing. So yeah.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.363
Cliff Main would take whatever
Sandpiper was offering.

41:31.447 --> 41:34.450
I already tried like hell
to get Sandpiper settled.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.328
Yeah, but you went about it wrong. Ha, ha.

41:37.411 --> 41:42.249
Sorry, but this is how you do it.

41:46.045 --> 41:48.422
And it's not like the old folks get stiffed.

41:48.506 --> 41:54.470
If Sandpiper settled now,
they might each get 15, 20 bucks less,

41:54.553 --> 41:57.890
but they get their money now
while they can still use it.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.477
And the lawyers get paid.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.481
And the lawyers get paid.

42:07.566 --> 42:09.735
How much of the common fund do you get?

42:12.613 --> 42:16.534
We get 20 percent of the common fund.

42:18.619 --> 42:19.954
I'm just-- I'm...

42:21.080 --> 42:24.250
-Forget it, okay?
-Okay.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.609
Hey.

44:13.692 --> 44:14.902
Hey.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.364
Have a seat.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.554
Hey, you did good today, huh?

44:42.638 --> 44:44.723
Tomorrow, I'll show you around.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.893
When you go back up north...

44:48.894 --> 44:51.730
you're gonna be halfway
to being a Salamanca, eh?

44:52.856 --> 44:53.982
Thanks.

45:01.323 --> 45:03.200
Another night owl, huh? You don't sleep?

45:04.785 --> 45:07.287
No. Not tonight.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.875
Yeah, I never sleep much.

45:13.710 --> 45:15.462
An hour, maybe two.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.048
It's enough.

45:20.467 --> 45:21.677
When it's like this...

45:25.055 --> 45:26.140
that's when I can think.

45:28.767 --> 45:32.521
I get my best ideas
when everybody else is asleep.

45:35.190 --> 45:37.401
Some people, they call it a curse.

45:37.484 --> 45:38.444
I like it.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.488
I don't know.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.245
I'd rather get some shuteye.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.874
LALO:
And yet here we are.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.429
Got anything stronger?

46:07.097 --> 46:08.765
Now you're talking.

46:10.350 --> 46:16.690
In the bar, bottom shelf, decanter,
that's the good stuff.

46:16.773 --> 46:18.400
Two glasses.

46:59.733 --> 47:03.028
There he is. I thought you got lost.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.629
You ever had Louis XIII?

47:20.712 --> 47:22.339
I don't think so.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.633
Oof. You're in for a treat.

47:33.350 --> 47:36.770
To sleep and those who need it.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.021
To sleep.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.280
What the hell is that?

47:51.577 --> 47:54.871
These morons have no respect!

47:54.955 --> 47:56.164
Ciro!

47:56.248 --> 47:58.375
What the hell is that, asshole?

48:41.585 --> 48:43.837
Inside. In the kitchen.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.519
Ciro!

48:59.603 --> 49:03.315
It's always the same!

49:03.398 --> 49:06.068
Ciro! Get in here!

49:06.151 --> 49:07.653
Ciro.

49:07.736 --> 49:08.570
What's up, boss?

49:08.654 --> 49:11.406
-What did you do? Are you smoking again?
-Boss, I didn't really.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.741
Ciro. Ciro.

49:12.824 --> 49:17.579
Don't lie to me. Don't blame Miguel.
I'm tired of these lies.

49:17.663 --> 49:23.210
Boss, I swear to God, I got myself a lighter.
See? It wasn't me!

52:01.034 --> 52:04.454
Go. Find where it comes out.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.051
<i>What do you see?</i>

52:19.052 --> 52:22.138
It's straight. At least a hundred meters long.

52:23.557 --> 52:27.227
I can see his blood. He's not far.

52:38.905 --> 52:40.198
<i>What was that?</i>

52:40.282 --> 52:41.533
Was that him?

53:28.538 --> 53:30.415
KIM:
What do you want?

53:31.416 --> 53:33.376
I'll have a little of everything.

53:35.211 --> 53:38.089
Actually, leave off the mint chip.

53:44.304 --> 53:50.560
I set the alarm for 6:00 since we have to check out
and go home before work.

53:51.561 --> 53:54.856
That's a solid two and a half hours. Sounds good.

54:12.540 --> 54:15.001
So, what would you do with it?

54:18.338 --> 54:20.632
I don't know. What would you?

54:22.342 --> 54:25.637
I'd hire Stef away from Schweikart.

54:26.888 --> 54:30.433
I'd hire Bruce from HHM.

54:30.517 --> 54:31.851
I'd get Viola.

54:32.936 --> 54:36.940
I'd rent the smallest, shittiest office
I could find at a courthouse

54:37.023 --> 54:39.526
and open a pro bono practice.

54:40.652 --> 54:45.657
Give regular people the kind of representation
usually only millionaires get.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.536
I was gonna say, we buy a house.

54:49.619 --> 54:52.330
Sorry, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:52.414 --> 54:53.790
We could do both.

54:55.208 --> 54:59.462
Last I heard, Sandpiper was willing
to go to 26 million.

55:00.463 --> 55:04.676
-Ahem. Wow, a third of that is 8.5.
-Mm-hm.

55:04.759 --> 55:07.470
-And 20 percent of that is...
-Around two mil.

55:12.684 --> 55:14.978
Uh, but it's not happening.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.481
Come on, Kim.

55:19.607 --> 55:24.487
We're not talking about a bar trick here.
We're talking about scorched earth.

55:26.322 --> 55:28.450
We would have to hurt him.

55:28.533 --> 55:29.659
Hurt him bad.

55:30.744 --> 55:35.206
To get a bunch of lawyers to run for the exits,
Howard would have to have done something...

55:35.290 --> 55:36.750
unforgivable.

55:36.833 --> 55:41.212
At the end of it, he might never be able
to practice law again.

55:42.505 --> 55:46.760
He doesn't deserve that.
And who knows if we could pull it off?

55:50.555 --> 55:56.186
Okay, maybe we could pull it off, yeah,
but we won't.

56:03.026 --> 56:06.112
We're talking about a career setback.

56:07.864 --> 56:11.743
A career setback for one lawyer.

56:13.787 --> 56:17.457
Yeah, I know, you could help a lot of people.
I get it, but...

56:20.335 --> 56:22.087
Kim, doing this...

56:23.588 --> 56:25.090
It's not you.

56:26.091 --> 56:30.136
Okay? You would not be okay with it.

56:30.220 --> 56:32.555
Not in the cold light of day.

56:35.975 --> 56:37.310
Wouldn't I?

56:48.571 --> 56:52.408
I'm gonna go take a shower,
so I don't have to in the morning.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.790
JIMMY:
Kim, you're shitting me, right?

57:57.891 --> 58:00.852
There's a middle man.

58:00.935 --> 58:02.770
I don't know who hired us.

58:03.771 --> 58:05.523
That's okay.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.735
I do.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.334
You're going to call to them.

58:25.335 --> 58:29.047
And you're going to tell them it was tough...

58:30.298 --> 58:31.758
but the job's done.

58:34.552 --> 58:36.679
I'll help you.
