19:23.125 --> 19:24.750
- But I want the farm.

19:24.792 --> 19:25.917
- You can't have the farm!

19:25.959 --> 19:27.500
- Don't make me lawyer up.

19:29.583 --> 19:31.291
- Wait, wait,

19:29.583 --> 19:31.291
wait a minute!

19:31.333 --> 19:33.959
So if The Dozer's

19:31.333 --> 19:33.959
not a bad kid...

19:34.000 --> 19:35.625
are any of you bad kids?

19:35.667 --> 19:37.875
- Nope. I only use my phone

19:35.667 --> 19:37.875
all the time

19:37.917 --> 19:39.959
because my best friend

19:37.917 --> 19:39.959
moved to New Zealand.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.500
- Oh!

19:40.000 --> 19:41.500
Let me guess.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.041
You probably have

19:41.542 --> 19:43.041
some heartwarming story

19:43.083 --> 19:44.333
about why you're called

19:43.083 --> 19:44.333
Johnny Meatballs.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.000
- Why can't I just

19:44.375 --> 19:46.000
like meatballs?

19:46.041 --> 19:47.750
- Meatballs are good.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.709
- Look, guys, we're really

19:47.792 --> 19:49.709
sorry we misjudged you,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.542
and I'm glad we're getting

19:49.750 --> 19:51.542
this chance to know each other,

19:51.583 --> 19:53.959
but we gotta get back in there

19:51.583 --> 19:53.959
before Tarian catches us.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
- Relax, Dawn.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.000
We're right here.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.375
We totally made it.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.041
Oh, no!

20:02.458 --> 20:04.041
- We must've left

20:02.458 --> 20:04.041
the machine on!

20:04.083 --> 20:06.166
- What do we do now?

20:06.208 --> 20:09.375
- I know exactly what to do.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.291
I've had dreams about this.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.125
I'm goin' cloud tastin'.

20:21.834 --> 20:23.458
- Anybody got any other ideas?

20:25.959 --> 20:27.709
Then let's go cloud tastin'.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.917
- Are you almost done with the--

20:35.959 --> 20:39.291
sweet spun sugar!

20:39.333 --> 20:40.583
What happened here?

20:40.625 --> 20:43.500
[all groaning]

20:43.542 --> 20:45.291
You dumped the whole bag in,

20:43.542 --> 20:45.291
didn't you?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.125
[all groaning]

20:47.166 --> 20:48.625
And then you ate it,

20:47.166 --> 20:48.625
didn't you?

20:48.667 --> 20:50.625
[all groaning]

20:50.667 --> 20:52.333
Well, I guess none of you

20:52.375 --> 20:53.834
are going to that carnival

20:52.375 --> 20:53.834
today.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.000
[all groaning]

20:55.041 --> 20:57.250
Now, if you'll excuse me...

20:57.291 --> 20:59.000
Shelly is saving

20:57.291 --> 20:59.000

The Slippery Slope

20:59.041 --> 21:01.750
To Nowhere.

21:01.792 --> 21:04.542
- Principal Tarian, wait.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.834
It was us four who had the idea

21:04.583 --> 21:07.834
to eat the cotton candy.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.333
- They had nothing

21:07.875 --> 21:11.333
to do with it.

21:11.375 --> 21:12.458
- Wow.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.917
That must be the truth...

21:13.959 --> 21:16.166
because I know you Harpers

21:13.959 --> 21:16.166
are way too selfish

21:16.208 --> 21:17.500
to take the blame

21:16.208 --> 21:17.500
for someone else.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.291
- It was a handful

21:17.542 --> 21:19.291
of incidents!

21:20.625 --> 21:22.458
- Well...

21:22.500 --> 21:25.333
I guess you three

21:22.500 --> 21:25.333
are free to go.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.208
And I'd get out quick

21:25.375 --> 21:27.208
if I were you.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.875
You don't want to end up
