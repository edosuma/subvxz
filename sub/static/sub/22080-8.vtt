[girl] Tom Cruise, Scientology is a cult.

00:12.220 --> 00:16.307
Then why are we so good at rehab
and have great gyms?

00:16.391 --> 00:17.767
It's true, they are great at rehab.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.061
Why are they doing a Tom Cruise version
of  The Crucible?

00:20.145 --> 00:22.105
You're glib, Goody Holmes.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.733
I wish I never hired you as my wife.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.819
Because the Church of Scientology
paid for our auditorium

00:27.902 --> 00:30.238

do you mind that I'm holding your hand?

You were great as Tom Cruise,

Oh, no, I was a pig in a blanket.

- I'm 16 and it's just wine.
- Cool, I guess-- Sure, I'll have some.

Wine, it's nature's fruit.

what do we tell your parents?

represented a child liquor distributor.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.646
You see that girl over there?

09:23.729 --> 09:26.399
She's a ninth grade blowjob machine.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.151
- What are you guys talking about?
- Oh, Missy's here.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.486
- Hi, Nick.
- Terrific.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.947
Uh, don't worry about me,
I'm gonna go mingle now.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.490
Okay. Guy talk talk.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.826
I have some concerns about my dinger.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.828
- The, you know, area...
- Okay, yeah, Nick.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.705
- ...where my dick is.
- I get it, I get it.

09:40.788 --> 09:43.457
But I really shouldn't leave Missy alone
at this party.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.585
I mean, she's talking to a pineapple.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.920
So, how'd you get your hair to do that?
[chuckles]

09:49.005 --> 09:52.383
Hmm. Well, no, no, no, no.

09:52.466 --> 09:56.220
- [jazz music playing]
- Duke. Duke, I--

09:56.304 --> 09:58.014
Nickelback. [laughs]

09:58.097 --> 10:02.351
Saw that party downstairs and figured
old Duke should have one of his own.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.646
- I see that.
- Nick Birch, this is Picasso.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.356
Whitney Houston, what's up baby?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.193
And over there Prince
and Liz Taylor and Richard Burton.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.863
They were married, it's a fucking mess.
[chuckles]

10:13.946 --> 10:15.990
Oh, Prince, I'm so sad that you died.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.284
- Hey, what about us?
- We're all dead here.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.660
♪ All dead
Oh! ♪

10:19.744 --> 10:20.995
- Be gone.
- Beat it, kid.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.288
All right, fine, I'll leave.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.874
It's just there's this girl
that gives blowjobs.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.667
- Actually, stay for a sec.
-  ♪ Yeah ♪

10:26.751 --> 10:29.795
- Tell Prince your problems.
- Her name is Tallulah Levine

10:29.879 --> 10:32.340
and they say she's a blowjob machine.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.468
- And when she goes down...
- All the boys in the town...

10:35.551 --> 10:37.845
- Give her a mouthful of cream.
- [laughing]

10:37.928 --> 10:40.514
All right.
Calm down, you swine.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.433
What's the problem, dear?

10:42.516 --> 10:44.435
Miss Taylor, I'm not gonna lie.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.605
My dick is maybe
not everything it could be.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.482
Well, it's not the size of the wave,

10:49.565 --> 10:52.860
it's the grace of your base
and the spasm in her chasm.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.282
Y también , my dick is a triangle.
It is over here.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.912
This is why I invented Cubism, so
I could be like, "Ooh, shapes are cool."

11:02.995 --> 11:05.206
Whip it out, darling.
Let's have a look.

11:05.289 --> 11:07.291
Show us that dick of yours, Nick.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.128

11:13.339 --> 11:15.383

11:15.466 --> 11:19.428
Well, if the incomparable
Ms. Whitney Houston

11:19.512 --> 11:21.055
wants to see my penis...

11:23.391 --> 11:25.101
¿Dónde está el pipi?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.311
Did you shave?
Is that ornamental?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.688
The boy just hasn't hit puberty yet.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.109
It's like a gold button
on a prep school blazer.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.861
Do you think it's too small
for Tallulah Levine?

11:35.945 --> 11:38.989
Does she have a gap between
her two front teeth? [laughs]

11:39.073 --> 11:41.534
Because then it might work out fine.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.371
Okay. Ha ha. Well, you're all dead.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.164
And you got a little dick.

Wowzy-wow!

[sniffs]

12:01.804 --> 12:03.848
Yeah, this is Leah's room.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.600
This is definitely the room
where it happens.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.519
I bet she has a really nice closet.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.229
Yeah, I don't-- I don't know,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.022
I don't know what her clothes smell like.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.274
I do. [chuckles]

12:13.357 --> 12:16.402
Oh, Andrew, have you ever heard
of this, uh, this game

- Holy shit, it's happening.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.699
It's go time, this is not a drill.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.534
Uh, Missy's being quite forward.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.119
- What's gotten into her?
- [chuckling]

12:25.202 --> 12:30.875
This boy's a tall lumpy, dumpy
drink of water and we are thirsty.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
Well, my mouth is dry.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.670
It's probably from the nerves.

12:34.753 --> 12:38.549
Hush, puppy. Less talk, more closet.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.431
Well, look who it is. Nick Birch.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.726
Well, look who it is to you,
Tallulah Levine.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.228
[laughs] Oh, using my full name, are you?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.939
Oh, I am indeed
'cause I am flirting with you.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.650
- Are you really?
- I are. Oh...

12:59.028 --> 13:02.239
So, okay. I-- I think
you're so cool and so pretty

13:02.323 --> 13:05.117
but I-- I just can't do that thing
that you want to do.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.454
- What thing?
- You know, your-- your passion?

13:08.537 --> 13:11.081
My passion?
What are you talking about?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.584
Tallulah, I can't let you
give me a blowjob.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.294
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

13:15.377 --> 13:17.880
What makes you think
I want to give you a blowjob?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.048
Your nickname.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.674
Oh, go fuck yourself.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.761
[scoffs] I hook up with a guy once
and he tells his friends

13:23.844 --> 13:26.430
I gave him a blowjob,
which by the way, I didn't.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.682
And all of a sudden, I'm The Machine?

13:28.766 --> 13:30.226
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.271
That's all I wanted, just to make out.
I'm stupid, remember?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.774
Yeah. Nick, you are stupid.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.654
[Jud] Well, you really fucked that up.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.698
- Shut up, you're a picture.
- No, I'm not, I'm in the wall.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.908
See?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.868
Okay. Seven minutes.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.538
- Hey, are you setting a timer?
- Starting now.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.956
- Maury.
- Connie.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.374
A word?

13:53.457 --> 13:54.875
So what are we talking about here?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.961
Kiss with tongue, under the shirt,
over the bra?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.879
What does your client know how to do?

13:58.963 --> 14:01.882
Oh, my client, he knows...
he knows nothing.

14:01.966 --> 14:06.720
It should be noted that my client
also has no idea what she's doing.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.139
So I don't...
I don't know what I'm doing.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.183
Me neither.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.442
[clink]

14:20.526 --> 14:22.778
Well done. Another first kiss
in the books.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.072
Mmm. Nothing like a first kiss.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.908
- Do you remember ours?
- Oh, don't, Maury.

14:27.992 --> 14:32.121
It was Pangaea, the dinosaurs
had just flown away in their spaceship.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.290
We had the whole planet to ourselves,
didn't we?

14:34.373 --> 14:38.669
Although, if memory serves, we did
make a few woolly mammoths blush.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.004
[chuckling]

14:40.087 --> 14:43.883
- It's good to see you, Connie.
- It's good to smell you.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.552
[growling and snarling]

14:49.847 --> 14:51.515
- [Missy] Mmm...
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.434
- Whoa, okay.
- What?

14:53.517 --> 14:54.351
Hi.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.104
What happened?
Why'd your damn client pull away?

14:57.187 --> 14:59.106
The kid was gonna paint
the inside of his pants.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.567
- I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean to--
- No, no, I'm sorry.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.570
I shouldn't have pushed my mons pubis
right up against you.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.989
- Your mom's what?
- It's the region right above my--

15:07.072 --> 15:08.282
Uh, well, darn it, forget it.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.576
You push too hard,
you got no boundaries.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.412
That's right, Maury, I can't be tamed.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.747
I never wanted to tame you.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.292
I just wanted to keep a toothbrush
and a few spare dicks at your apartment.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.627
Oh, Connie.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.046
I think maybe we should
go back to the party.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.964
Well, we have two minutes left.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.008
We could accomplish quite a lot
in that time.

- [gasps] Shh!

15:27.468 --> 15:30.137

- Yeah, okay.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.098
[whispers] Whoa, that's Leah.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.267
- And who's that guy?
- I don't know.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.394
The only person I met was that pineapple.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.940
Nicky, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.650
Lay off, Diane.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.444
- Who are you talking to?
- Who are  you  talking to?

15:45.527 --> 15:48.614
- Uh, are you drunk right now?
- Come here, I'll tell you.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.282
- I'm here.
- None of your fucking business.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.325
- [groans]
- [laughs]

15:51.408 --> 15:52.618
What's up, chicken butt?

15:52.701 --> 15:56.038
Nothing, just, you know, my parents
are officially the worst.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.124
Oh, here's a cool tidbit, my dad
smokes weed all the time.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.918
Well, your mom's not perfect either.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.044
What?

16:02.127 --> 16:04.254
- Nothing.
- That's a very weird thing to say.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.881
Ye-- yeah, you're right.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.926
I mean, don't even listen to me.
I don't even know what I'm talking about.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.178
- No, why did you say that?
- Why did I say what?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.389
- Tell me. Tell me, Nick.
- [sighs]

16:13.472 --> 16:16.600
When Andrew and I were in the city,
we saw this hat

16:16.684 --> 16:20.437
and then it kissed your mom,
and then the hat was a woman.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.107
- What?
- I couldn't be clearer, Jessi.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.151
Your mom kissed a woman
and the woman wasn't your dad.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.861
Are you serious?

16:27.945 --> 16:30.906
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Jessi.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.034
Wait a minute, you guys went
to the city, like, two weeks ago.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.829
- Who's keeping calendar?
- I am keeping calendar.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.457
You never told me you saw my mom
cheating on my dad.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.668
- You suck.
- [groans] I'm sorry, Jessi.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.461
You are a bad friend.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.256
Oh, fuck. Me and my big mouth.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.382

Hey you, and you at home
on the elliptical watching this,

16:55.055 --> 16:56.890
I see you.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.684
Don't you say a fucking word.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.810
[laughing]

17:01.645 --> 17:03.063
We should get out of here.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.482
If we walk out now,
it'll look totally weird.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.276
Well, let's just not watch.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.111
Okay. Not watching.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.364

17:12.448 --> 17:13.782
- What's he doing?
- Ooh.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.286
Mm-mmm. Oh, no, no, no, no.
Let's just-- just keep doing this.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.457
Mmm-- mm-mmm. Uh...

- Hey, he's doing it again.
- Don't be afraid.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.753
- Mm-mmm. Oh, Daniel. Daniel, stop.
- What?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.255
I think I made it clear
I didn't want to do that.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.758
God, you're really tangled
and not sexually, huh?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.135
- Excuse me?
- Why are you being so weird?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.095
- Wow. You know what?
- Come on, what's your problem?

17:35.179 --> 17:37.097
This is my room but I'm out of here.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.767
- I have blue balls. That's assault.
- [Leah groans]

17:39.850 --> 17:42.186
- That was...
- Awful.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.314
[gulps] Ooh!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.149
Hot daddy. [coughs]

17:47.232 --> 17:48.942
That is sweet stuff.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.486
- Hit me again.
- Are you sure?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.362
Yeah. What's the point of any of this?

17:52.446 --> 17:55.908
- It's all bullshit anyway.
- Yeah. It is bullshit.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
My family sucks.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.621
My family sucks, too.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.919
Party Wolf.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.670
Yeah.

18:08.754 --> 18:13.092
The hormones in this house
are going bananas cream pudding.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.594
Maury. Maury!

18:15.677 --> 18:18.055
I changed my mind.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.850
Oh, my God. What happened up there,
that was so messed up.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.436
I know. I'm sorry. I crossed a line.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.813
What? No, not you.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.191
That guy, trying to get Leah
to su--su-- do something.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.360
We're all a little out of control tonight.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.780
Hey, Maury.
You can keep your dicks at my apartment.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.282
I'll give you your own dick drawer.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.535
Ow! Fuck you, coffee table.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.370
[kissing and moaning]

18:41.453 --> 18:44.289
Wow. You taste so much better
than my bath mat.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.791

Oh, my God.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.423
- I'm so sorry.
- Meh, no biggie.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.051
Oh, what's this?
There's more? Wow!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.636
- Oh, my goodness.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.681
You always just have a string of scarves
hidden in your clothes?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.975
Yeah, you never know when someone's
gonna barf brandy on you.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.977
Thank you for being so cool about this.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.021
Are you kidding?
I'm just so jazzed you tongued me.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.149
This was a one-time thing, okay?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.317
- Oh, Jessi, I promise.
- Never to be discussed again.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
- I'm only gonna tell my brothers.
- Never discussed again.

Hey, there you are.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.498
- Are you drinking coffee?
- Sort of.

19:26.582 --> 19:30.419
I didn't know how to make it, so I just
stirred up coffee grounds into warm water.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.713
It's actually-- it's not bad.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.131
Nick, listen.

19:34.214 --> 19:38.135
Your sister was upstairs
with some guy in a beanie hat.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.804
Oh, that's Daniel.
Leah likes him.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.973
- Not anymore.
- Yeah. Never again.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.349
He was really aggressive.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.227
He tried to force her to do something
she did not want to do.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.730
You guys are crazy.
Daniel's the man.

Hey. My turn.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.757

Our fabulous hostess, come on down.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.343
Thank you, Daniel.
[sighs]

20:19.426 --> 20:21.637
- Okay.
- [boy] Ooh, ooh!

20:21.720 --> 20:23.805
- You're making out with somebody.
- Kissing someone.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.557
Ooh, ooh! Barack Obama.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.726
[boy] And you're pushing someone's...

20:27.809 --> 20:29.853
- Coach Steve eating a sandwich.
- [Missy] You're praying?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.480
You're praying to Mecca,
you're a Muslim.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.899
- Barack Hussein Obama.
- [girl] Someone kissing another person.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.610
- [Jay] Is it Party Wolf?
- Daniel, you're doing Daniel.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.903
Wait, what? That's not me.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.072
Actually, that  is  so you.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.323
How is that Daniel?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.951
- He's a head pusher.
- He's a head pusher.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.744
- He did a head push.
- Head push?

20:45.827 --> 20:47.913
[ Seinfeld  theme plays]

20:47.996 --> 20:49.665
What is a head push?

20:49.748 --> 20:54.962
It's when a man pushes a woman's head
to try to get a blowjob.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.463
Wait, that's a move?

20:56.546 --> 20:59.258
Not a fan of the head push.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.885
All my life I've been waiting for them
to go down there.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.762
- I didn't know you could do a push.
- You can't push.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.181
No push. I'm not pushing, baby.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.766

Nick, I need to borrow your car.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.353
Okay, hold on.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.563
You're making it sound like
I assaulted you or something.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.941
- You tried to push my head down.
- I made a suggestion.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.527
Oh, yeah, and when I didn't take
your suggestion,

21:18.610 --> 21:19.903
- you did it again.
- Come on.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.407
I wish women were more sex positive,
but we're just not there yet.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.784
- What?
- Guys have to take the lead.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.412
I mean, come on. How else are guys
supposed to get blowjobs?

21:28.495 --> 21:30.789
You lean your head back,
arch your crotch in the air

21:30.872 --> 21:34.376
and say, "Dinner is served."

21:34.459 --> 21:36.253
Well, crazy idea.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.880
You could wait for a girl
to  want  to go down on you.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.591
Come on, that's not happening.
Am I right? Party Wolf?

21:41.675 --> 21:43.218
Or how about asking?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.386
Oh, good Lord, no.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.305
That sounds like the most
embarrassing conversation ever.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.724
- Well then, you don't get a blowjob.
- Okay, yeah.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.393
As long as no one has
to talk about it, I'm fine with that.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.063
Or you could go down on her.
Pleasure begets pleasure.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.942
Just don't pressure people.
It's not cool.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.029
Fine, I confess.
I assaulted Andrew in the closet.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.406
- I'm a mons pusher.
- Mons pusher?

22:04.489 --> 22:05.991
- Mons?
- A mons?

[ Seinfeld  theme plays]

22:08.410 --> 22:11.663

What exactly  is  a mons?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.248
The mons pubis? Oh.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.377
It's the, uh, the welcome mat
to the pleasure palace.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.546
I mean, let's be honest,
who doesn't love the mons?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.340
Very big on the mons, baby.

isn't lost on all of you.

What the fuck are you talking about?

22:31.725 --> 22:32.893

22:32.976 --> 22:35.645
This is a witch hunt,
just like  The Cruise-ible.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.190
All I wanted was a blowjob
at a high school party.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.316
Is that such a crime?

22:39.399 --> 22:42.402
Hey, only I get to quote
my dad's law commercials.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.238
Look, nobody cherishes women
more than I do.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.365
Oh, yeah. You cherish them so much

22:47.449 --> 22:50.786
that when a girl doesn't give you
a blowjob, you tell everyone she did.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.371
Daniel, you've been
a busy little asshole, huh?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.831
Hold on, he's the one?

22:54.915 --> 22:59.252
Well, this  was  a real teachable moment
and now it's become something so ugly.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.004
If you're looking
for something to blame here,

23:01.088 --> 23:03.799
and I'm backing out of the room,
it's party culture.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.551
Okay, you're officially the worst person.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.638
You're slut shaming me.
Shame on you.

Finally. Someone who gets it.
Preach, big man.

Oh, I'm not big. I'm very little,

23:15.393 --> 23:20.565

and I think coffee grounds all night long,
