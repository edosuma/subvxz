00:06.480 --> 00:08.400
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:53.760 --> 00:55.760
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:55.800 --> 00:57.720
JEREMY: Thank you so much.
-(WHISTLING)

01:00.880 --> 01:02.760
They're a rowdy bunch.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.480
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.720
Hello, and welcome to what
is a Grand Tour mini-special.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.560
It's all based around here

01:11.560 --> 01:14.160
in this rather troubled
part of the world.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.680
You've got Syria and Iraq and
Iran, sort of at the bottom.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.000
And then at the top
you've got Russia.

01:20.040 --> 01:25.280
But in-between you have
this sliver of peace
and prosperity.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.480
And that got us thinking.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.680
You see, if you live on
the shores of the Black Sea

01:30.720 --> 01:33.960
and you're partial to
a bit of fish, you're fine.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.760
But...
What if you like bream?

01:36.800 --> 01:40.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-You see,
bream likes fresh water.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.720
And the Black Sea is salty.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.200
The nearest fresh water
is all the way over here
in the Caspian.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.080
And that is a thousand
kilometres away.

01:49.120 --> 01:54.120
Yeah, so we were wondering,
if you have to drive
all that way for your supper,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.400
what would be the best car?

01:56.440 --> 02:00.640
Obviously, you'd need some
sort of GT, but which one?

02:00.680 --> 02:04.960
The new Aston Martin DBS? The
new Bentley Continental GT?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.600
Or the newerer BMW 8 Series?

02:07.640 --> 02:12.280
Now this is exactly the
sort of question this show
was designed to answer.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.600
(LAUGHTER)

02:13.600 --> 02:17.680
So, this week, we took
The Grand Tour to Batumi,

02:17.720 --> 02:21.280
in the former Soviet State
of Georgia.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.760
(GULLS CRY)

02:38.240 --> 02:41.600
JEREMY: The meeting point
was on the shores of
the Black Sea,

02:41.600 --> 02:46.120
and naturally enough James
May was the last to arrive.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.800
In the new BMW 8 Series.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.520
God, it doesn't look anything
like as good in the flesh
as it did in the pictures.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.360
RICHARD: It is
disappointing in the metal.
I'm afraid that's the case.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.160
-And brown!
-What?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.000
-Brown!
-It's sunburst orange.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.040
-Mate, that's a brown car.
-Sunburst orange.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.560
JEREMY: It's brown!
JAMES: Orange!

03:07.600 --> 03:09.600
-It looks very like a Toyota.
-It doesn't.

03:09.640 --> 03:12.640
Is it on delivery wheels -
are they specially for
delivering it?

03:12.680 --> 03:15.280
-What are you talking about?
-Those little wheels they can
move it around on.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.320
That's what I mean. They're
not big enough, are they?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.520
-Can you have
a 22-inch wheel?
-No.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.720
-Why not?
-Why would you want
a 22-inch wheel?

03:21.760 --> 03:24.040
-It would spoil the ride.
-It would fill the arches.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.760
RICHARD: Yeah.
-Ooh, ooh, ooh!

03:25.800 --> 03:29.040
And I suspect...
criminal offence.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.600
-What?
-Anyone who puts an M badge

03:31.640 --> 03:34.560
on a BMW that isn't an M BMW
has to go to prison.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.480
So this is one of those
M cars that isn't an M car.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.920
-They've done that before.
-No, it's not the M8.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.800
-Why does it say M8 on it?
-Because it's the M Sport,
in effect.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.240
-So M Sport just means
not an M, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.880
But it's in-between the M
and the normal cars.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.560
That's why you have M Sport
5 Series, for example.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.880
This is like Elton John's
Greatest Hits

03:52.920 --> 03:55.360
without Your Song
or Tiny Dancer on it.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.160
James, I don't want to be
childish about this now...

03:58.200 --> 04:01.520
-Do you not?
But you're going to.
-I hate your gear lever.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.320
-I love it.
-Look at it!

04:03.360 --> 04:04.720
I think that's fantastic.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.080
JEREMY: And the rest...

04:06.120 --> 04:08.200
It's a horrible gear lever
in a boring interior.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.640
JAMES: That's contemporary
and tasteful.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.960
Let's look at yours.
What have you got?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.200
You've got the new Bentley

04:12.240 --> 04:14.360
that's the same
as the old Bentley.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.600
Apart from being
a completely new car.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.960
-Yeah, but it looks the same.
-It doesn't look the same.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.800
It's complete...
different front end.
Different size.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.440
-No, it looks like
an Aventador.
-Different back.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.880
-No.
-It's a completely new car.

04:24.920 --> 04:29.440
-This monochrome Union Jack
applied by Germans?
RICHARD: Yes?

04:29.480 --> 04:30.920
RICHARD: There is
some German involved.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.880
-Chassis? German.
-Yeah.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.160
-Engine? German?
-Yeah.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.320
Oh, no, the Germans
have done all the tech
and engineering.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.080
That'll-- No, wait,
it will be brilliant.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.120
-(LAUGHTER)
RICHARD: What?

04:43.160 --> 04:47.480
It's a bit... I use the word
advisedly - it's a bit camp.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.360
JEREMY: It's not camp!
-It is.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.920
-What's camp about that?
-It's all pleated
and leathery and... Urgh!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.640
JEREMY: It does give
good occasion, that.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.240
RICHARD:
That is a special event.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.600
JAMES: Does Liberace pop up
out of the centre console

04:58.640 --> 05:00.600
and play the piano for you?

05:00.640 --> 05:03.440
You see, the reason I'm not
having a go at your interior

05:03.480 --> 05:07.320
is my Aston has been
delivered with
Birmingham spec.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.760
JAMES: That's horrible!
-Ooh, that's quite vivid,
isn't it?

05:10.800 --> 05:15.200
I mean, worryingly for you,
I quite like that interior.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.920
JEREMY:
You like that? Exactly.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.240
So this is...it's a DB11.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.560
Well, no. It's the DBS.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.080
JEREMY: Superleggera.
RICHARD: Because it's
very light, isn't it?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.920
-Is it?
-That's what superleggera
means, yeah?

05:26.920 --> 05:30.880
It's 72 kilograms lighter
than a DB11.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.440
And no more expensive.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.160
-It's a bit more expensive.
-How much more expensive?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.960
-It's £67,000 more...
-Yes.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.200
-...than the DB11.
-How much is it?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.800
-A lot.
-Is it something like a
quarter of a million pounds?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.320
-No!
-What is it, then?

05:44.360 --> 05:47.240
-A little bit less.
-230?

05:47.280 --> 05:49.240
-A bit less.
-225?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.960
-Yes.
-Mine's £100,000.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.800
It's contemporary
and it's modern.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.080
It's no good saying,
"It looks Japanese"
as if that's a slur.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.120
-The Japanese
advanced the car massively.
-No, no, that just means...

05:58.160 --> 05:59.560
(CONVERSATION FADES)

05:59.600 --> 06:02.320
JEREMY: Eventually,
we decided to stop arguing

06:02.360 --> 06:05.200
and drive from here
on the Black Sea

06:05.240 --> 06:08.440
right through Georgia
and Azerbaijan

06:08.480 --> 06:12.360
to the Caspian for a nice
piece of grilled bream.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.000
Funny thing is,
I've no idea what
to expect on this journey.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.840
I mean, I've seen the
Grand Prix from Azerbaijan

06:32.880 --> 06:34.880
and I've seen Borat .

06:34.920 --> 06:36.520
Hmm... Which is it?

06:36.560 --> 06:38.960
I don't know what the roads
are gonna be like.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.600
I mean, should we be doing
this in pick-up trucks?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.240
Or tanks?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.200
I mean, this is
the former Soviet Union.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.840
It doesn't look it,
but it is.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.240
Whatever. The roads
at this point were fine.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.480
So, we could get to know
our cars.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.200
The question I really want
to answer on this journey
is this:

07:03.240 --> 07:09.000
How can the DBS be worth
£67,000 more than the DB11

07:09.040 --> 07:11.800
when,
from where I'm sitting...

07:11.840 --> 07:14.120
they appear to be
exactly the same.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.800
At first, you're forced
to say, "Well, it isn't."

07:18.840 --> 07:20.840
This interior
simply isn't good enough

07:20.880 --> 07:23.720
in a £225,000 car.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.760
Just not even close.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.920
You look at the Bentley
and you go,
"That is an interior."

07:28.960 --> 07:31.200
It's chintzy, but it's...

07:31.240 --> 07:32.640
fabulous.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.840
However, as we left the city,

07:35.880 --> 07:39.920
the DBS's true colours
started to shine through.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.800
This is by far the most
powerful car here,
and the lightest.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.840
And the most
sort of aggressive.

07:49.880 --> 07:54.000
And yet it just glides along,
in GT mode,

07:54.040 --> 07:55.960
which I'm in now -
Grand Touring mode.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.440
It's like a hovercraft.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.040
Whooosh!

08:02.080 --> 08:06.120
(WHISPERS) I'm driving
a twin-turbo-charged VI2.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.000
I can go 211mph.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.920
And I can whisper at 70.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.800
But when you shift from
GT mode to Sport mode,

08:17.840 --> 08:19.960
it's a very different animal.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.240
-Ready?
-(ENGINE REVS)

08:25.600 --> 08:27.520
(ENGINE ROARS)

08:32.280 --> 08:36.000
Jesus Christ. Whoo!
(CHUCKLES)

08:36.040 --> 08:38.080
Right, there's
a small difference there

08:38.120 --> 08:42.720
between the DB11 and...
and this.

08:42.760 --> 08:46.440
I'm afraid you're going
to have to face facts,
both of you.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.320
You're in wheelbarrows
and I'm in a spaceship.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.360
Ahh.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.080
An old man imagining
he's James Bond.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.880
The thing is, if we're going
to talk about long-legged,

09:00.960 --> 09:03.320
luxurious,
continent-crossing GT cars

09:03.360 --> 09:05.280
we're talking about Bentleys.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.480
They're the definitive GTs.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.360
Whisper-quiet,
velvety-smooth,

09:11.400 --> 09:14.200
a hint of
massive power waiting.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.880
626 horsepower
under my right foot.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.280
(REVVING)

09:23.200 --> 09:25.200
Ooh-hoo, my word.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.440
Ha-ha!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.720
But the GT car,
first and foremost,

09:35.760 --> 09:37.520
has got to be
a nice place to be.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.600
Because, by definition,
you're going to spend
a lot of time in it.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.000
And this
is a fine place to be.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.880
This finish on the centre
console - this metal here -

09:48.960 --> 09:51.960
is aluminium that's been
milled in the same way

09:52.000 --> 09:56.640
that they mill aluminium
inserts in the back of
expensive watches.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.200
If I press this button here
I can rotate between
my different screens.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.080
Oh, analogue dials
and clocks!

10:03.120 --> 10:05.000
In the centre of the dash,
thank you.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.360
(CHUCKLES)

10:08.440 --> 10:10.360
The problem for me with the
Bentley and the Aston

10:10.400 --> 10:14.960
is that they're actually
a bit too hung-up
on being British.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.400
It is a bit of a British
disease. We can't
shake it off.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.480
We're obsessed
with phoney heritage

10:19.520 --> 10:21.120
and the meaning of tradition.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.240
It's all just nonsense,
really.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.880
Actually, if you want to talk
about heritage and traditions

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
then the BMW
has the strongest.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.080
It's still made in Munich
by the same company.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.200
They make their own bits.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.640
And some of those bits
are very good.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.760
It has a 4.4-litre
twin-turbo-charged V8,

10:41.840 --> 10:44.440
developing 523 horsepower.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.280
(ENGINE REVS)

10:48.640 --> 10:51.520
It also has four-wheel drive,
rear-wheel steering,

10:51.600 --> 10:53.320
and adaptive anti-roll bars.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.280
It has an eight-speed
gear box.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.760
It's not twin clutch,
but it is flappy paddle,
and it is very sharp.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.760
There we go -
drop it down to three.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.040
This is a proper car.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.040
Not tinsel!

11:12.480 --> 11:15.200
JEREMY: After James
had finished his
interesting lecture

11:15.240 --> 11:17.040
on what's wrong with Britain,

11:17.080 --> 11:20.240
May started to think
about buying some fruit.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.240
JAMES:
Anybody need a lemon?

11:23.280 --> 11:25.800
Er...
No, I'm all right, thanks.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.560
I don't want...
Oh, hang on, they've all had
the same idea here, look.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.200
Lemons on the right.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.920
There can't be
another lemon stall.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.320
Seriously...
It is - it's more lemons.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.400
Why doesn't someone go,
"Right, everyone is selling
lemons on this piece of road,

11:42.440 --> 11:45.600
we're gonna sell furniture."

11:45.640 --> 11:48.040
Also, as a general rule,
you don't need many lemons,

11:48.080 --> 11:49.360
whatever you're making.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.640
We must have driven past,
what, 10,000?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.240
There's some more here
on the right.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.960
Well, that's one evening
with Richard Hammond's
gin and tonic intake.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.000
Just trying out
the voice activation system.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.520
Always worth a laugh.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.880
"Enter country."

12:07.920 --> 12:11.080
FEMALE VOICE: Please
say the name of the country.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.480
-Georgia.
-Malta. Accepted.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.160
-I don't want to go to Malta.
-Would you like to enter
a destination?

12:17.200 --> 12:20.800
-No.
-Please say
the name of the country.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.680
Georgia.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.920
Please say the name
of the desired country.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.880
Georgia.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.920
Please say the name
of a country.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.960
For example, England.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.600
Georgia.

12:33.640 --> 12:36.200
Please say the name
of the desired country.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.120
Say the name
of the country as one word.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.080
For example, France.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.280
Yes. Georgia.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.920
-Cancel.
-(BEEP)

12:47.960 --> 12:52.080
JEREMY: Even though our cars
didn't recognise Georgia
as a country,

12:52.120 --> 12:54.920
we soon arrived
in the town of Gori.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.000
The birthplace
of Joseph Stalin.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.160
Look at that -
is that a Stalin museum?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.640
Can we just have a look?

13:04.680 --> 13:06.560
Yeah, we can have a look.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.120
Trouble is, when you tend
to go into a building
owned by Stalin

13:09.160 --> 13:10.960
you rarely come out again.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.400
JEREMY: In the museum grounds
we found the house

13:14.440 --> 13:18.400
where the Soviet dictator
grew up.

13:18.440 --> 13:22.200
So Stalin sat at that table
in the morning,
when he was a little boy.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.600
-Yes.
-And said,
"One day when I grow up

13:24.640 --> 13:27.080
I want to be
the nastiest piece of work

13:27.120 --> 13:28.960
the world has ever seen."

13:29.000 --> 13:30.760
And the parents
would have said,

13:30.800 --> 13:32.240
"There's a little boy
in Austria

13:32.280 --> 13:34.880
and he wants to be the
nastiest piece of work.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.200
But we think, son, you can be
an even nastier piece of
work." And then he was.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.360
"You can be whatever
you wanna be, son."

13:40.400 --> 13:43.360
"If you wanna be
the biggest bastard
the world has ever seen."

13:43.400 --> 13:45.520
-Bastard is a good word.
-And his mum said to him,

13:45.560 --> 13:48.200
"Are you sure you wouldn't
like to follow your father
and be a shoemaker?"

13:48.240 --> 13:50.960
"No. I want to murder
20,000,000 people."

13:51.000 --> 13:55.240
He was actually sitting right
here in his little shorts
and his little moustache.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.160
That is really
weird, though,

13:58.200 --> 13:59.440
isn't it, to think
what started in here.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.840
-(THUDDING)
-I've broken Stalin's house.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-Jeez, I'm going to
the Gulag.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.160
-James!
-(GUFFAWING)

14:09.200 --> 14:12.000
"I've broken Stalin's house!"

14:14.880 --> 14:18.680
JEREMY: Outside, we checked
out the statue of Stalin.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.320
Which that night
caused a debate between...

14:21.360 --> 14:23.200
well, two of us.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.880
The man who beat Hitler
is from your town,

14:29.920 --> 14:33.200
so obviously,
as they have done,
you put up a statue to him.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.240
But then it turns out

14:35.280 --> 14:37.520
that he's an even bigger
mass murderer,

14:37.560 --> 14:39.400
so do you take it down?

14:39.440 --> 14:42.200
Eee, it's tricky, that one.
It's very tricky.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.680
Can we talk about our cars?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.280
BOTH: No.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.000
I'm not interested
in the war.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.960
Well, it's more than the war,
Hammond.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.320
This is the sort of pivotal
bit of 20th-century history.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.320
It affected the whole world.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.320
-Right. Well, I'm off to bed.
-What?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.000
-I'm off to bed.
-Going to bed?

14:59.040 --> 15:00.800
I'm going to bed.
See you in the morning.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.200
We must have bored him,
cos he's left some of
his gin and tonic.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.240
JEREMY: After some more
considered debate

15:06.280 --> 15:08.520
about the town's
Stalin's problems,

15:08.560 --> 15:10.880
I had a brainwave.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.240
I tell you what,
that statue...

15:15.280 --> 15:17.440
maybe we
could take it down for them.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.280
-Make up their minds
for them.
-Exactly.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.680
-Do you know--
-Cos they're...

15:21.720 --> 15:23.520
This whole town, big dilemma.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.840
Do you know what it's like?
It's like someone who has

15:25.880 --> 15:28.480
an old piece of furniture
that they don't really like,

15:28.520 --> 15:31.160
but they can't throw it away
because it was
their grandma's.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.880
But we'll go
and throw it away for them.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.400
And then
they're actually glad.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.080
Cos there's no question they
shouldn't have a statue...

15:37.120 --> 15:39.880
-Course you shouldn't.
-I mean, I can't remember
the town in Austria,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.480
not Germany,
where Hitler was born.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.680
But I bet they haven't
got a statue to him...

15:45.720 --> 15:50.720
And so, that night,
when the town's people
were fast asleep...

15:50.760 --> 15:52.680
(FOOTSTEPS ON GRAVEL)

15:59.640 --> 16:02.280
-I may have
overdone that bit.
-I meant turn them off.

Put the ladder... No.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.200
The next morning
as we were saddling up,

16:33.240 --> 16:37.160
Richard Hammond
had a question.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.520
Why have you put Nigel
Mansell's head on my bonnet?

16:40.560 --> 16:43.280
JEREMY: I thought
you'd like it. You know.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.080
British racing driver,
British car,

16:45.120 --> 16:46.160
I thought
it would be appropriate.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.800
It's a bold statement,
isn't it?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.680
You've got a famous
Brummie in the car,

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
and on the front of the car.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.800
Nigel Mansell must have been
a big name around here.

17:08.840 --> 17:11.040
A lot of people
looking at him.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.080
Was Nigel Mansell
popular here?

17:13.160 --> 17:15.920
JEREMY:
Yes. Global superstar, mate.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.520
Global superstar.
They love him.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.560
- Why? Are people pointing?
-Yeah.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.240
They must have been
into racing or something.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
Did Nigel
ever race a Bentley?

17:24.320 --> 17:27.800
No, mostly Williams
is what he's famous for.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.440
Oh, yeah, that might be
what's confusing people.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.640
That's why they look puzzled.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.080
I'd quite like to be
Richard Hammond.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.960
Life is so much simpler.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.520
Our next destination was
a racetrack 70 miles away.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.800
And because James and I
had racist satnavs...

17:46.800 --> 17:49.800
we were taking guidance
from the man up front.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.040
Which was a mistake.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.800
Hammond, we've definitely
been round here before.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.560
If you wanted me to be
in charge of navigation,

17:58.560 --> 18:00.960
you shouldn't have glued
Nigel Mansell's head
to my bonnet.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.080
I'm trying.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.720
Eventually, Hammond managed
to stumble across the highway
leading out of town.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.960
But things
didn't really get any better.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.040
Why are we going so slowly?
I'm being overtaken
by trucks.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.920
Well, Nigel Mansell's head
gets in the way of road signs

18:22.960 --> 18:24.920
and I have to crane round him
to see them.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.920
And I don't want
to miss them.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.520
There's a sign there to
Tehran, which is in Iran.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.560
We're not going to Iran.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.240
Well, I don't know.
I can't see the bloody signs,
because of Nigel.

This is embarrassing.

We're going to be
all over the news.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.680
Hammond's gonna read it
and say, "That wasn't
Nigel Mansell, you bastards."

18:49.720 --> 18:52.680
It was somebody called
Josephine Stalin.

I found what I reckoned
was our turn-off.

- It's down here.
-No, it's not down here.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.560
We'll go down this bit
and then there'll be
a bigger road again

19:04.560 --> 19:07.080
and we'll be there.

with machine guns.

it's here.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.160
So, well, what they do,

20:22.200 --> 20:25.080
is they put this barbed-wire

woke up and the Welsh

are further forwards.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.760
I'm never gonna make it.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.840
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

34:38.160 --> 34:40.080
(GROANS)

34:45.800 --> 34:47.080
That'll do. That'll do.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.960
Just... (GROANS)

34:50.000 --> 34:53.160
Can't run. (HYPERVENTILATING)

34:53.160 --> 34:55.600
It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

34:55.640 --> 34:58.200
-(TRICKLING)
-What? Who's in there?

34:58.280 --> 35:00.080
-James.
-Bugger off,
I'm having a wazz.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.200
-Hurry up.
-I'm having a wazz.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.800
Just hurry up! I'm going
to go in a minute.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.600
-(SILENCE)
-Oh, he's...

35:06.640 --> 35:08.760
Right, that's it. Let me in.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
-(TRICKLING)
-Oh, God, there's more!

35:10.800 --> 35:12.120
Oh, God.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.160
It's just awful. When you...

35:14.200 --> 35:18.040
Listen, mate, James
is in there and I'm first.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.080
You ain't getting in
ahead of me.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.200
-It's fine. Just relax.
-There's no way.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.600
It is awful, though, when
you get to the door,

35:23.640 --> 35:26.600
your body's saying,
yes, time to go.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.160
-But then you can't.
-Stop talking.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.000
Why aren't you bothered
anyway?

35:30.040 --> 35:33.840
Well, I solved the problem,
second corner.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.120
-Oh, yeah.
-So...

35:36.160 --> 35:38.560
-James...
-I'm having a wazz.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.000
Yes, I know.
I've got the times.
It's quite interesting.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.840
You were a second slower
on that lap.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.760
I'm desperate for a slash.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.280
Do you think
you were faster or slower?

35:48.320 --> 35:50.000
I don't care.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.120
-Richard Hammond...
-J...

35:52.160 --> 35:55.640
your original lap, two
minutes four point eight.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.040
-Your new lap...
-Stop talking.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.000
-Two minutes...
-Yes, whatever.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.840
..zero point five.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.560
You were slower as well.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.560
Because I was
concentrating on not
doing what you've done.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.880
Yeah, well, that's
interesting. Because I did
what I did, look at that.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.480
How interesting is that.
Exactly the same.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.880
-I mean, I was basically...
-James!

36:13.920 --> 36:16.400
-Hurry up!
-I was point three
of a second slower.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.360
But basically the same.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.360
JEREMY: After our
important day's work,

36:27.400 --> 36:31.280
I cleaned myself up and we
headed into Tbilisi,

36:31.320 --> 36:33.000
Georgia's capital,

36:33.040 --> 36:38.120
for something you can only
get in this country.

36:38.160 --> 36:42.320
You see, the thing is,
America gave the world
aviation.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.040
Germany gave it the car.
Britain gave it the internet.

36:45.080 --> 36:50.880
But Georgia's contribution
was much more profound
and important.

36:50.920 --> 36:55.160
You see, Georgia
gave the world... wine.

36:57.760 --> 37:02.640
They've been making wine
in Georgia for 4,000 years.

37:02.640 --> 37:07.800
It's such a big thing here,
they now have spas
where you can bathe in it.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.480
-How does it feel?
-Tremendous.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.640
This is wine.

37:20.640 --> 37:24.360
-That's the great thing about
that. He doesn't need a plug.
-No.

37:24.400 --> 37:29.280
He will simply lower himself
down and consume
his bathwater.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.080
If I were to take
the plug out now,

37:31.120 --> 37:33.640
would you panic
and try and drink it all
before it went away?

37:33.680 --> 37:36.160
Hang on, I just need to
rinse my hair.
Hold on a minute.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.800
-He's actually going to...
-Oh, God, he is.
-..wash his hair in wine.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.400
Oh, no, he is!

37:40.440 --> 37:42.480
Oh, God,
I got some in my mouth.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.440
James, do not
fall asleep in the bath.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.400
-OK.
-He's going to.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.600
Now I can relax.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.560
-(DISTANT BANG)
-Ooh...

38:02.120 --> 38:05.360
JEREMY: The next morning,
we went for a drive
around Tbilisi,

38:05.400 --> 38:08.640
one of the coolest cities
we'd ever been to.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.200
Who is this on his horse?

38:15.280 --> 38:19.560
According to the sign, it's
King David the Builder.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.360
-What?
-Better than
Eric the Chemist.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.560
(LAUGHS)

38:23.600 --> 38:25.160
The last builder I had
working on the house

38:25.160 --> 38:26.520
didn't look like that.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.480
He certainly didn't
turn up on a horse.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.640
We then found a flea market

38:32.640 --> 38:36.120
and decided to test the boot
space in our grand tourers

38:36.160 --> 38:38.800
by picking up
a few souvenirs.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.840
-(LAUGHTER)
-I'm not sure

38:43.880 --> 38:47.160
they would have been
able to win a war like this.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.160
This is a Russian wall clock.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.560
It says Moscow on the dial.
It works.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.400
-(WHIRR AND CLICK)
-Is it a Soviet one?
-Yeah.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.960
A Soviet cine-camera.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.360
Now, come on.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.320
(PLAYS QUIETLY)

39:05.520 --> 39:08.640
How much is
the record player?

39:08.640 --> 39:12.600
-I'm going to do a selfie.
-(CLICK)

39:12.640 --> 39:16.640
I like the way
that they've captured the
lustfulness of the lady dog

39:16.640 --> 39:20.200
and the wistfulness of James.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.320
Having done our shopping,

39:22.360 --> 39:25.280
Hammond and I
were soon back at our cars

39:25.320 --> 39:28.360
and filling up the boots.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.400
-What have you bought?
-A giant pair of jugs.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.960
Georgian wine jugs.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.760
Do you know what the Georgian
is for wine jugs?

39:35.800 --> 39:37.400
-No.
-Norks.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.600
-Is it?
-Yeah.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.920
So you've got
two giant norks.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.760
Yeah. A guitar and a clock.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.040
And I'm very pleased
with my purchases.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.440
What's with the trombone,
or whatever it is?

39:46.480 --> 39:47.920
Well, it won't fit.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.960
With my record player and my
bird and my gas mask...

39:51.000 --> 39:53.400
That's a striking piece.
Well, put it
on the back seat.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.640
-Quite small.
-It will go on...

39:55.640 --> 39:57.800
The back seat
will accommodate that, look.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.920
-He's going to be critical.
-Oh, my God!

39:59.960 --> 40:01.800
There you go.
Told you he would.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.640
-Do Aston Martin
describe that as a back seat?
-Yes.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.440
I wouldn't call it
a leather pouch.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.200
(STRAINS AND LAUGHS)

40:10.280 --> 40:11.800
-I can't argue...
-(LAUGHS)

40:11.840 --> 40:15.040
-I can't argue with him.
-It's not acceptable.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.440
-Are you actually in?
-Yes.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.520
-Head room?
-(WAILS) No.

40:19.560 --> 40:22.440
That is absolutely hopeless.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.800
Anyway, the interesting thing
about the Aston Martin is...

40:26.840 --> 40:30.680
-I've got quite a lot to say.
-I need to get out now!

40:30.760 --> 40:32.840
At this point,
James came back.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.680
After a very ambitious
shopping trip.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.800
Could you hold
the porcupine, please?

40:37.840 --> 40:39.560
Yak goes in first.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.480
You won't...
How big is that boot?

40:41.520 --> 40:43.880
-It is actually really big.
-It's unnecessarily big,
actually.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.520
-It's too much boot.
-It's a grand tourer.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.160
It's for taking luggage as
you said only the other day.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.560
His Master's Voice
will go there.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.400
And then the Spanish
man-o-war...

40:54.440 --> 40:59.200
JEREMY: I then came up with
a plan to get rid of what
wouldn't fit in my car.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.320
I bought you a present.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.640
You're a musical man.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.160
That's very thoughtful
of him, actually.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.480
Thank you.

41:04.520 --> 41:07.120
With our souvenirs
loaded up,

41:07.160 --> 41:08.960
we got back on the road.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.280
(RATTLING)

41:27.040 --> 41:28.840
Lot of rattling in here.
I'm a bit worried that

41:28.880 --> 41:32.600
my big jugs are going to rub
against my clock and ruin it.

41:32.640 --> 41:37.640
JAMES: I thought you jammed
your clock between the jugs,
so that it wouldn't.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.760
Finbarr Saunders
And His Double Entendres.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.680
JEREMY: Soon,
we arrived at the border.

41:50.480 --> 41:54.280
Where Europe stops
and Asia begins.

41:59.440 --> 42:03.280
So there we are.
Bye-bye, Georgia,
the birthplace of wine,

42:03.320 --> 42:05.520
and hello Azerbaijan,

42:05.560 --> 42:09.600
the birthplace of something
very nearly as important.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.480
Oil.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.760
It was first discovered here
in the third century.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.800
Marco Polo wrote about it
a thousand years ago.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.360
He said it didn't
taste very nice.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.600
The oil industry began here.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.840
This was the first country
in the world to develop
offshore drilling.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.360
But, weirdly,
we are struggling
to find a petrol station.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.440
This meant
we had to back off a bit.

42:35.480 --> 42:39.640
Which prompted
some smug eco-sermons
from Hammond and May.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.160
As we're now in the cruise,

42:44.200 --> 42:45.800
my car can do
a very clever thing.

42:45.840 --> 42:48.400
Its W12 can shut down
six cylinders

42:48.440 --> 42:50.680
and run as a V6
to save fuel.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.760
And you can get
as much as 30mpg,

42:53.800 --> 42:56.640
but actually that's quite
a lot for a 2.2-tonne car.

42:56.640 --> 43:01.080
And more importantly, it
means I get a 500-mile range
out of a tank.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.560
What I can do is
I can put it in Eco Pro mode,
which I'm just doing now,

43:05.600 --> 43:08.960
which shuts down
some vital features.
Not the engine fortunately.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.320
And I have an active grille.

43:11.360 --> 43:13.000
The flaps open
when they need to

43:13.040 --> 43:16.640
and then shut for better
aerodynamic efficiency
when they're not needed.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.320
So this is all hi-tech stuff
we're doing.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.200
Jeremy,
what's your Aston Martin got?

43:22.280 --> 43:24.680
Well, between 40 and 80

43:24.760 --> 43:28.400
it'll shut down six
of the cylinders and run
as a straight six

43:28.440 --> 43:31.760
until the catalytic converter
on the shut-down bank
gets cool,

43:31.800 --> 43:34.560
then it starts that bank up
again and shuts
the other one down,

43:34.600 --> 43:38.040
alternating to make sure
everything is at
the optimum temperature.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.040
Ha-ha!
They weren't ready for that.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.160
Happily, at this point

43:44.200 --> 43:47.360
we finally found
a fuel station.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.640
Oh.

43:50.680 --> 43:53.280
Now, that's
an oil company name
I wasn't expecting.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.880
Really?

43:56.920 --> 43:59.840
I know this is childish
but it says...

43:59.880 --> 44:02.600
(LAUGHTER)

44:02.640 --> 44:05.640
-I wish we had Turd Petrol
in Britain.
-I really do.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.080
Turd Petrol!

44:08.120 --> 44:10.880
JEREMY: Why don't
they sponsor
a Formula 1 team?

44:10.920 --> 44:13.240
Powered by Turd!

44:13.280 --> 44:15.040
-Think of the skid marks.
-Think of the commentary.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.240
(LAUGHING)

44:18.280 --> 44:23.080
Back on the move,
we started to soak up
the local motoring culture.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.200
Which didn't take long.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.320
Lada, Lada

44:32.360 --> 44:34.280
and Lada.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.400
RICHARD:
Lada, Lada, Lada.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.640
Lada, Lada.

44:39.680 --> 44:42.240
Three Ladas there,
a Lada there,

44:42.280 --> 44:44.200
two Ladas there.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.600
If there's
a Lada owners' club

44:45.640 --> 44:47.680
in Azerbaijan,
it could be massive.

44:47.720 --> 44:51.080
"What Car?" must have been a
very thin magazine over here.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.000
(RICHARD AND JEREMY LAUGH)

44:57.720 --> 45:01.440
JEREMY: At the next town,
May and I
wanted to pull over.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.320
And Hammond didn't.

45:04.360 --> 45:05.880
It's all very nice
jollying around

45:05.920 --> 45:07.720
but these are GT cars.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.520
We've got
a couple of miles in them.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.960
We've got miles to go.
We need to get a move on.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.040
The town, however,
was called Ganja.

45:16.080 --> 45:20.680
So obviously May and I
wanted to experience
the architecture.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.960
-You know I'm building
a new house?
-Yes.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.800
I think I've got
the scale of it wrong.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.200
-Really?
-Mm. I think it needs
to be more like this.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.960
This. I like the arch.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.200
I think the Cotswolds needs
this kind of architecture
in it.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.960
Can we stop stopping off
to look at things?

45:58.000 --> 46:01.480
The whole point of this trip
is to prove that these
powerful GT cars

46:01.520 --> 46:04.440
can devour continents
and we're not
devouring any miles.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.200
-Ooh.
-Well, we need to get going.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.800
You do know that these
aren't actually quicker

46:07.840 --> 46:09.560
than any
other type of car?

46:09.600 --> 46:11.240
-What?
-No, in the real world.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.160
I mean, these feel great.
That's why we like them.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.000
It's nice having a powerful
car, etc.
But in the real world

46:16.040 --> 46:19.080
they don't go any faster
or slower than any
other type of car.

46:19.120 --> 46:20.920
-But they go faster.
-They don't.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.840
What? Those Ladas we've
been overtaking endlessly
since we got here.

46:23.880 --> 46:28.800
You're saying that my twin
turbocharged Aston Martin
is no faster than them?

46:28.840 --> 46:30.840
Not in the real world.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.680
I'll demonstrate it to you,
tomorrow.

46:33.720 --> 46:35.640
Oh, God.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.200
(Tomorrow afternoon)

46:42.240 --> 46:44.440
Right, May,
what is your thinking?

46:44.480 --> 46:47.520
Well, I've bought this
Renault 9. It's the GTL.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.840
And I've flown Abbie
out to drive it

46:52.880 --> 46:56.360
and we're going to drive 50
miles to a place called the
Garden of Paradise.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.440
Why can't we just
go where we're going?

46:59.480 --> 47:02.720
Cos I just said we're going
to the Garden of Paradise.
It'll be nice.

47:02.760 --> 47:05.320
-So Abbie gets a two-minute
head start.
-Mm-hm.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.960
You won't be
able to catch her.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.080
-We will.
-You won't.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.000
-A two-minute head start...
-Yes.

47:11.040 --> 47:15.360
-..and you think we can't
catch her up in 50 miles?
-Exactly.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.800
That's not in good condition.

47:16.840 --> 47:18.160
It wasn't very expensive.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.560
Start the engine, please.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.080
(ENGINE STRUGGLES TO
TURN OVER, STARTS)

47:23.120 --> 47:24.520
-Oh, well.
-Oh, well.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.080
Oh, we're in trouble now.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.080
-Right, you ready?
-Purrs like a kitten.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.920
In three, two, one...

47:29.960 --> 47:32.640
-Go!
-(ENGINE STALLS)
-(ABBIE CHUCKLES)

47:32.680 --> 47:35.720
-Professional racing driver.
-She's good. She's good.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.600
-You've bought a dog.
-It doesn't work!

47:38.640 --> 47:40.640
(ENGINE REVS)

47:40.680 --> 47:43.080
-There.
-Ooh.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.320
So James May's experiment...

47:49.360 --> 47:52.520
Is an Aston Martin DBS,
twin turbo,

47:52.560 --> 47:56.400
faster than an ancient
rusting Renault 9?

47:58.160 --> 47:59.680
18 seconds.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.920
Stop sounding excited about
this ridiculous escapade.

48:05.080 --> 48:07.000
Two, one, begin.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.120
(REVVING)

48:11.160 --> 48:14.840
Right, let's get this charade
over with, shall we?

48:14.880 --> 48:17.360
And prove that James is mad.

48:17.400 --> 48:20.800
The point of having a GT car
with tonnes of power is it
makes you feel good

48:20.840 --> 48:22.760
and it's nice.
But it's not quick.

48:26.360 --> 48:29.800
All cars in the real world
go at the same speed

48:29.840 --> 48:33.400
because how fast they go is
dictated by external factors,

48:33.440 --> 48:34.920
not the car itself.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.920
Traffic lights,
speed cameras,

48:36.960 --> 48:38.720
other cars,
pedestrians crossing.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.880
All these things
just bunch everybody up.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.680
If you have a powerful engine
in your car, you can get home
at night more quickly.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.960
Which means you spend more
time with your children.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.480
Which means they're
less likely to grow up
as glue sniffers.

48:57.520 --> 49:01.080
JEREMY: Soon we were out of
the town and on the motorway.

49:01.120 --> 49:04.240
But there was a problem.

49:04.280 --> 49:08.240
These speed cameras,
they're at every 100 yards.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.200
Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

49:10.240 --> 49:13.120
But Abbie has got
the same problem.

49:13.160 --> 49:16.040
She's not
getting away from us.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.840
-No, but we're not catching
her either, are we?
-No.

49:22.080 --> 49:27.120
Once we got off the motorway,
though, Hammond and I
splashed the brown roadblock

49:27.160 --> 49:29.080
and got cracking.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.360
Abbie is a brilliant driver.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.440
Make no mistake. She's
a lot better at it than me.

49:39.480 --> 49:43.320
But I've got 14 times
more horsepower.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.640
All I had to do
to catch her, then,

49:45.680 --> 49:47.560
was overtake everything.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.440
But that wasn't easy.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.400
Single unbroken line.
Can't overtake.

49:52.440 --> 49:53.680
Can't overtake.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.680
Right, we're stuck
behind a Lada.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.640
-Oh, God, car coming
the other way.
-(HORN)

50:00.040 --> 50:02.440
Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.920
And there's Jeremy Clarkson
behind a lorry.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.280
As I am.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.080
Yeah, that's what you need.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.160
Town...

50:17.200 --> 50:19.240
Oh... What are you doing?

50:19.280 --> 50:22.720
-(HORN)
-You dithering half-wit.

50:22.760 --> 50:26.600
In James' real world, we
weren't getting any breaks.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.240
Oh, great. Digger.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.920
Oh, God.

50:31.960 --> 50:35.440
Whereas up ahead,
Abbie was in scythe mode.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.840
Oh, come on!

50:45.880 --> 50:49.000
Right, Lada...
Lada, Lada, Lada.

50:49.040 --> 50:53.520
It's like they're releasing
them every seven seconds
coming the other way.

50:53.560 --> 50:56.800
Oh, good. Red light.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.760
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

51:02.200 --> 51:05.760
Nine, eight, seven, six,

51:05.800 --> 51:07.600
five, four,

51:07.640 --> 51:09.280
three, two...

51:09.320 --> 51:11.880
Hello, chaps.
Waiting at the lights?

51:11.920 --> 51:14.920
Oh, Christ.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.760
Mercifully, though, we were
soon out of the town

51:17.800 --> 51:19.720
and onto the open road.

51:23.800 --> 51:25.240
(HORN)

51:25.280 --> 51:27.520
RICHARD: Freedom!

51:27.560 --> 51:28.880
Yes!

51:28.920 --> 51:31.480
Splash the Lada.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.360
-(HORN)
-Another one.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.320
It's clear.

51:38.840 --> 51:43.960
But then, with just 10 miles
to go, everything got rural.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.560
Hammond, cows, cows, cows!

51:47.960 --> 51:49.880
(BARKING)

51:51.880 --> 51:54.760
As things became
even more rural,

51:54.800 --> 51:58.200
the Aston started
to have a problem.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.320
It's barely moving.
What's he doing?

52:00.360 --> 52:02.200
RICHARD:
Can't you pick it up a bit?

52:02.240 --> 52:05.880
JEREMY:
It's bumpy and the camber
is all over the shop.

52:05.920 --> 52:09.120
Yeah, it's not perfect but
it's drivable. Come on!

52:09.160 --> 52:14.120
Hammond, I've got 715
horsepower and only
rear-wheel drive.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.360
Right, this is ridiculous.
I'm going to come past.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.840
I've got torque vectoring,
four-wheel drive.
It can handle this.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.760
RICHARD: Meanwhile, further
back in the Eeyore W...

52:32.200 --> 52:34.320
I bet you she's still
two minutes ahead.

52:38.680 --> 52:41.160
Why have you stopped?

52:41.200 --> 52:44.720
Because there's an entire
farm coming towards me.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.680
(BLEATING AND BELLS RINGING)

52:50.680 --> 52:53.640
It's a river of wool
and lunch.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.440
Please don't
scratch my Bentley.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.800
Please don't scratch
my Bentley.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.560
(LOWING AND BELLS RINGING)

53:02.600 --> 53:03.880
All right?

53:10.680 --> 53:14.320
JEREMY: As we approached
journey's end, the road
surface improved.

53:14.360 --> 53:18.240
So we could both unleash
our massive horsepower.

53:22.840 --> 53:24.360
So here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.160
Richard Hammond's
on a mountain road

53:26.200 --> 53:27.600
in a Bentley going quickly.

53:28.920 --> 53:30.840
So nothing can go wrong here.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.720
We've got to have
closed the gap by now.

53:37.800 --> 53:40.640
No offence, Abbie,
but you're not having this.

53:40.680 --> 53:43.760
JEREMY:
The finish line at the Garden
of Paradise was close.

53:43.800 --> 53:48.280
And as we entered
the outskirts,
the patio of paradise,

53:48.320 --> 53:50.240
Abbie was in sight.

53:51.920 --> 53:53.960
The race we knew
would be ours

53:54.000 --> 53:56.600
but then it turned out
that actually

53:56.640 --> 53:59.920
the finish line
was in the 14th Century.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.200
RICHARD: Oh, my word.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.080
Getting narrow, very narrow.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.120
(KNOCKING)

54:08.160 --> 54:09.600
Oh, I don't know how much

54:09.640 --> 54:11.480
a carbon fibre chin spoiler
is on one of these

54:11.520 --> 54:13.000
but I bet it's a lot.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.480
(REVVING)

54:15.520 --> 54:18.160
Abbie, however,
wasn't worried about
that sort of thing.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.680
(KNOCKING)

54:23.720 --> 54:28.400
That's the sound of a crow
rubbing against
a Russian stereo.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.400
(SCRAPING)

54:32.800 --> 54:34.200
(SCRAPING)

54:34.240 --> 54:36.240
That was not good.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.440
-Hello.
-Hammond, I'm beached.

54:39.480 --> 54:41.640
I'm going to find
another route.

54:45.720 --> 54:47.640
-Oh, is it really round here?
-(KNOCKING)

54:49.280 --> 54:51.880
A lot of noise
from the boot now.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.160
JEREMY: Meanwhile,
I'd found another route

54:54.200 --> 54:56.440
that wasn't much better.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.840
-(SCRAPING)
-Oh, God.

54:58.880 --> 55:03.760
James May's ideal motor race,
this. I'm doing four, three.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.280
By this stage
I knew I'd lost.

55:06.320 --> 55:09.600
So I needed to
come up with an excuse.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.920
Are these for the head?

55:11.960 --> 55:13.560
A hat.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.720
This is not
Bentley country now.

55:15.760 --> 55:19.720
This is really
Land Rover territory.

55:19.760 --> 55:22.040
James May, you are
a bloody idiot.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.680
Sit-rep, man arrived
at the window,

55:25.720 --> 55:30.240
took 30 units of currency
away and I now have this hat.

55:33.640 --> 55:39.480
Eventually Hammond and I
found Abbie's victorious
Renault at the finish line.

55:39.520 --> 55:43.040
And then what was definitely
several hours later,

55:43.080 --> 55:45.040
May turned up.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.600
RICHARD: Oh, here he is.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.560
JEREMY: Oh, God.

55:50.760 --> 55:53.040
-Who won, then?
-We did!

55:53.080 --> 55:55.880
-Did you?
-No. No. We didn't.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.800
-He went hat shopping.
-I did. Look.

55:58.840 --> 56:00.840
-Really?
-It took him ages
choosing that one.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.280
Honestly,
we must have been... How
long were we hat shopping?

56:03.320 --> 56:05.600
Must have been a good half
hour to get the right one.

56:05.640 --> 56:08.320
Well, half an hour
with the black one
and then I didn't like it.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.160
That does not happen
by accident.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.240
That sort of thing
takes time.

56:12.280 --> 56:16.040
Anyway, this does prove,
does it not, that fast cars,
yes, they're great,

56:16.080 --> 56:20.280
but they're not fast. In the
real world a Renault 9 is as
fast as an Aston or Bentley

56:20.320 --> 56:21.720
-or a BMW.
-Ow! Agh! Agh!

56:21.760 --> 56:24.560
-What?
-Ohh! There's been
an accident.

56:24.600 --> 56:25.960
There's no other word for it.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.720
-The... My... Look.
-You've ruined your crow.

56:27.760 --> 56:31.680
The crow's beak's
come off and base.

56:31.720 --> 56:35.720
But more... Look. That all
was in me a minute ago

56:35.760 --> 56:37.000
and now it's not.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.240
Why's it coming out of you?

56:38.280 --> 56:41.560
Because half the crow's face
went in there

56:41.600 --> 56:43.520
-when I picked it up.
-It attacked you?

56:43.560 --> 56:45.320
That was a really priceless
ornament, that.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.720
That's a real shame.

56:46.760 --> 56:48.240
That's coming out at a rate.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.200
I reckon you've probably got
three, maybe four minutes.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.560
-That's a pint.
-It's not a pint. It's spread
out thin on the floor.

56:53.600 --> 56:56.440
If this were you there'd be
bloody helicopters coming,

56:56.480 --> 56:58.760
-trousers being cut off.
-Yeah. I'd be out of here
by now.

56:58.800 --> 57:00.760
I'm just getting on with it.
Go and have a look

57:00.800 --> 57:02.760
-how much damage
you've done in yours.
-Mine'll be fine.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.880
I won't have done any damage
in the Bentley.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.480
-Oh, God!
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)

57:12.360 --> 57:15.160
-Go on, say it.
-I've lost my jugs
and my clock.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.120
-All I've got is this ring.
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)

57:21.920 --> 57:26.360
JEREMY: With James'
unrealistic real world test
out of the way,

57:26.400 --> 57:28.440
we continued heading east

57:28.480 --> 57:33.360
and eventually we arrived
at the fount of everything.

57:46.960 --> 57:50.120
The cradle of humankind
is in South Africa.

57:50.160 --> 57:53.280
That's where we began
as a species.

57:53.320 --> 57:57.240
But the cradle of everything
that makes us special

57:57.280 --> 57:59.160
is here.

57:59.200 --> 58:04.240
The things that we make
out of what's coming
out of the ground here

58:04.280 --> 58:06.720
boggles the mind.

58:06.760 --> 58:09.280
Toothbrushes, crayons,

58:09.320 --> 58:11.440
heart valves, parachutes,

58:11.480 --> 58:12.920
anti-freeze.

58:12.960 --> 58:16.480
JAMES: Vinyl records,
cassette tapes,

58:16.520 --> 58:19.440
CDs, training shoes.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.880
Guitar strings, balloons,

58:21.920 --> 58:24.600
sunglasses, life jackets.

58:24.640 --> 58:27.920
Anaesthetics,
enamel, dentures,

58:27.960 --> 58:30.400
prosthetic limbs, shampoo.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.120
Disposable ballpoint pen,

58:33.160 --> 58:34.640
smartphone,

58:34.680 --> 58:38.280
face creams, deodorants.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.600
Lipstick, fishing rods,

58:40.640 --> 58:43.400
electric blankets,
insect repellent,

58:43.440 --> 58:45.160
umbrellas, roofing.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.160
Light switches, dishwashers,

58:48.200 --> 58:50.400
John Travolta's face.

58:50.440 --> 58:53.320
Antiseptic,
food preservatives,

58:53.360 --> 58:55.440
basketballs, putty,

58:55.480 --> 58:58.440
motorcycle helmets, boats,

58:58.480 --> 59:00.120
soft contact lenses.

59:00.160 --> 59:03.120
The crackly bottle
your water comes in.

59:03.160 --> 59:06.240
Fan belts, satellite dishes,

59:06.280 --> 59:08.200
Frisbees, heat,

59:09.760 --> 59:11.400
light.

59:11.440 --> 59:14.000
And most importantly of all,

59:14.040 --> 59:17.720
the amber nectar
of the gods, petrol.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.960
JEREMY: Oil is so important
here, in fact,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.120
they've built a spa
where you can bathe in it.

59:28.520 --> 59:31.880
It was like the wine spa
we found in Georgia,

59:31.920 --> 59:35.240
apart from in every way.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.920
(BUBBLING)

59:37.960 --> 59:40.920
-Is that really crude oil?
-Yeah.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.120
I feel like a guillemot.

59:43.160 --> 59:44.320
(LAUGHS)

59:44.360 --> 59:46.840
Any minute now some woman
with hairy armpits

59:46.880 --> 59:49.760
will take me to a yurt
and wash me down
with Fairy Liquid

59:49.800 --> 59:51.360
and say,
"Look what we found."

59:51.400 --> 59:53.400
-Where's our baths?
-We've only got the one bath.

59:53.440 --> 59:54.800
You're not getting in here
with me.

59:54.840 --> 59:56.560
Well, I'm not
getting in after you.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.440
-Why not?
-Are you kidding?

59:58.480 --> 1:00:02.160
Well, because that would be
full of your scabs
and dandruff...

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:07.760
JEREMY: The next day,
after I'd been scraped clean,

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.280
we set off
for the Caspian Sea.

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:16.080
And since we were almost
at journey's end,

1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:19.480
it felt like a good time
to sum up our cars.

1:00:22.360 --> 1:00:24.400
All the things a car
has to excel at

1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:27.080
to be a good GT car,

1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.160
luxury, comfort,
power, style,

1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:33.120
make for just
a good car of any sort.

1:00:33.160 --> 1:00:35.520
And this new Bentley
Continental GT

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:39.440
is a very, very,
very good GT car.

1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:43.000
But it has surprised me
beyond that.

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:47.880
At the track, when two
and a quarter tonnes of car
felt nimble and agile.

1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:51.920
But above all else
it's about this interior.

1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:57.080
This is just a nicer place to
be than anywhere else.

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:01.040
Got to say it...
This thing is a masterpiece.

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:03.600
They've absolutely nailed it.

1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:05.840
And it deserves to wear
its flying B.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.920
What a thing.

1:01:17.600 --> 1:01:21.040
So, my BMW.
Now, when we started
this trip,

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:23.720
I merely thought
it was rather good.

1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:26.880
But now... I'm pretty much
in love with it.

1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:31.320
And most of that,
to be honest, is because
of that V8 engine.

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:33.920
It's smooth,
it's quiet, it's unobtrusive,

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.400
but then you just knock
it down a few
and give it a bit of shoe...

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.560
(REVS)

1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:40.320
See? It becomes sonorous.

1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:42.600
Its voice becomes
more heartfelt

1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:45.720
and it tingles
through the steering wheel
and through my buttocks.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:47.040
It's lovely.

1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:48.400
And the other thing...

1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:50.240
And I know this is
going to sound

1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:52.440
a little bit sort of
#FirstWorldConsideration

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:56.560
but it's only £100,000.

1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:00.880
Considerably less than
half the price of
the Aston Martin.

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.920
It also looks better
and it's made by Germans.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:06.640
Buy this.

1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:17.520
JEREMY:
It's been a great trip, this.

1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:19.760
A couple of things
we've learned on the way...

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:23.000
No.1, Georgia, hidden gem.

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:24.600
Tbilisi in particular.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:28.760
And No.2, pottery is
much sharper
than you might imagine.

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:35.000
Then there's the DBS
and that is tricky.

1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:38.080
It is as fast as hell
and it's comfortable

1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:41.640
and it looks sensational.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.720
It's a hugely appealing car

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:50.000
but is it worth £70,000 more
than the also hugely
appealing DB11?

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:54.000
And I don't think it is.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:58.040
I just don't think it is.

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:01.920
Maybe if they'd fitted
an interior that
made you feel special

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:04.840
like the interior does
in the Bentley,

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:07.520
I'd have a different view,
but they didn't.

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.800
So I don't. Sorry.

1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:16.040
JEREMY: After a stunning
drive through the tip of
the Caucasus,

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:21.080
we eventually arrived in
the jaw-dropping capital
of Azerbaijan.

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:32.360
Here we are. Baku,

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:36.280
where there is, let's be
honest, some architecture.

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.800
I mean, look at that.

1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:45.960
A British architect
did that,

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.440
my favouritest building
in the world

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:50.400
by a long way.

1:03:53.440 --> 1:03:56.320
These cars are now looking...
well, I'd call them heroic.

1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:58.960
James would say disgusting.

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.360
James May, how annoyed
are you by the dirtiness
of your car?

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:05.640
-(LAUGHS)
-I was just saying
that we're in disgrace.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.120
Because this is a shiny,
spangly city.

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:10.160
We should make our cars
shiny and spangly.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:12.440
It only takes a minute
to clean them.

1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:14.000
These look like
they've done work

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:15.960
and battled
and fought through.

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:19.320
-No, they look dirty.
-(LAUGHS)

1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:30.000
Ooh, hello. This is a bit of
the Grand Prix track.

1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:34.000
Of course, they have the
Grand Prix here now.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:37.920
Why don't we do a lap
of the Grand Prix track?

1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:41.760
Well, because I doubt
you can. It's not just
a track, is it?

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:45.720
Well, why don't we do a drag
race on the main straight?

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:50.000
Because it's a city. You
can't just do a drag race.

1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:52.280
What if we asked
really nicely?

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:59.560
As Hammond didn't have
an answer to that,
I did ask really nicely.

1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:03.160
And the next day
they really did close off
the main straight.

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.640
So we could have
our important drag race.

1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.640
(REVVING)

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.960
The Aston should
absolutely cream this.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.880
On paper it's faster to 60
and it's more powerful.

1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:20.440
And it's lighter.

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:23.160
But it's rear-wheel drive
and it's a wet track.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:28.800
I have four-wheel drive
and launch control.

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:31.920
My only slight worry is
James has got them as well.

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:38.360
Here's my prediction.
Their four-wheel drive
systems and launch controls

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:40.800
will get them
off the line quickly.

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:45.000
And then once
I've got the power down,
I'll just become a missile.

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:52.000
This is not a race
to see who wins.

1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:55.760
It's a race to see which one
of my colleagues loses.

1:05:55.800 --> 1:05:57.720
(REVVING)

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.720
OK, here we go.

1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:12.920
And we are away!

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:16.360
Can't get the power down.

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:19.760
Whoa!

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:23.480
Oh, I feel it slithering,
that four-wheel drive
doing its job.

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:28.840
Whoa! OK...

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:34.040
Bentley's reeling me in.
I don't think
he's going to do it.

1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.320
Come on, BMW.

1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:41.040
Yes! (LAUGHS)

1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:43.280
Where's Jeremy gone?

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.880
Interesting building here.
It's a government building.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:47.960
I'm just going to
have a look at it.

1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:52.440
Yeah, nice.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:57.160
Having looked
at the building, I decided
to have another go.

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:04.280
But still the Aston
would not behave.

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:06.600
Oh, my....

1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:08.640
Oh, jeez.

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.200
Victory!

1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:19.840
So is it just
all over the place?

1:07:19.880 --> 1:07:24.240
I'm using about a quarter
throttle and it's sideways.

1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:26.680
(LAUGHS)
It's not brilliant, is it?

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:30.400
Well done for getting
permission but not so good
on the weather.

1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:34.160
I therefore decided that
before we tried again,

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:37.400
I should do something
about the weather.

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:40.080
So I got us
and all our crew vehicles

1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:43.720
to drive up and down the
track to try and dry it out.

1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:48.400
This took quite a while.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.080
RICHARD ON RADIO:
Jeremy, on that first run,
did some poo come out?

1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:56.360
Difficult to keep the poo in
when your anus
is as well oiled as mine.

1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:00.120
How dry are we going to be
able to get this track?

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.160
JEREMY: It's drying out
on James' side.

1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:04.000
If we do another run
with me there...

1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:06.960
-Be all right.
-Well, it's hardly
real world, is it,

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.280
choosing which bit of
the road you drive on
to make your car faster.

1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:16.360
As that is in fact exactly
what you do in a race,

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:18.600
I ignored him
and lined up

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:21.680
for our third attempt
on the dry line.

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:27.320
So, BMW, Bentley or
the surface-to-air missile.

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.320
Which will win?

1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.400
Amber.

1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:44.000
JEREMY: Ohh!

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.320
It's a great start.

1:08:48.840 --> 1:08:51.760
Jesus! It's still doing it.

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.720
80mph, 90mph.

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:56.920
Oh, it's going
sideways again.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.920
Oh, my...

1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.880
Ohh!

1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:04.240
Oh, jeez!

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:08.400
-Reel him in, reel him in.
-Come on, BMW.

1:09:10.560 --> 1:09:13.160
Oh, bugger!

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:15.960
(LAUGHS)

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.920
Well, there we are. The Aston
was by far the most exciting
to look at there.

1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:22.160
As usual.

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:24.040
So now let's get some lunch.

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:35.200
And moments later
we found our grail.

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:44.560
There we are, look, 50 feet
below sea level and we have
arrived at journey's end.

1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:46.840
The Caspian.

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:51.520
The largest inland body of
water in the world.

1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:57.920
Our journey is complete.

1:09:57.960 --> 1:09:59.880
Let's get a bream.

1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:14.960
A bream's fish?

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.640
No, Hammond, they're cows.
Of course they're fish!

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.680
I don't like fish.

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:22.760
-Well, on that terrible
disappointment...
-For him.

1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.720
Mm. ...back to the tent.

1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:28.520
-(CHOKES)
-(LAUGHTER)

1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:31.000
Why did you say "Back to
the tent," you idiot?

1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:34.080
Um... Oh, right, um...
It just slipped...

1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:36.520
-I've got biscuit.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:39.720
-You don't do that.
-It slipped out.
-Never do that.

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:43.320
It gives us a chance at least
to say how good GT cars are.

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.240
-I love them.
-Mm.

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.080
Engine at the front and all
the power you need.

1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:48.320
They're everything
you want in a car.

1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:50.320
I agree. The BMW
was the best as well.

1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:51.640
-Eh?
-Yes, but, James,

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.000
why don't you tell
the ladies and gentlemen

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:56.160
about the BMW's
lane departure system?

1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:59.240
You know, the one that
keeps you in the white lines
when you're driving along.

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:01.360
Yeah, well, the thing is,
it was a pre-production car.

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.680
It had a slight glitch in it.
You couldn't turn it off.

1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:05.800
And it's quite annoying
on the road because
it does that.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:09.760
But on the track,
the problem is that you
aim for a perfect apex

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.560
but the car thinks, he's
about to have an accident.

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.840
It just throws you
back into the middle of
the track again.

1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:16.440
-(LAUGHTER)
-It was extremely irritating.

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:19.600
There was that, which
you moaned about a lot,
and the gearbox.

1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:21.680
Yeah, the gearbox, well...
(LAUGHS)

1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:25.440
The problem there is,
the display on the dash,
there's two of them.

1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:28.280
-One of them says
what gear you've selected...
-Mm.

1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.760
...but the other one says
what gear the car
thinks you should be in.

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:33.360
So, again on the track,
you'll be driving along,

1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:34.640
going, here comes
a left-hand bend...

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:36.280
(IMITATES CHANGING DOWN)

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.280
..right down to second and
the car would go, seventh?

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.240
(LAUGHTER)

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:43.440
-That is annoying.
-It's basically just Germans

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:45.440
saying, "The Englander
knows nothing here."

1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:46.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-Exactly.

1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000
But it was bloody fast,
the BMW.

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:51.720
-It was excellent.
-But I still think the
Bentley was the best.

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:53.320
-It was the best.
-I agree.

1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:54.880
-What?
-I agree.

1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:56.320
Look, I really like
the DBS, OK?

1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:57.720
It was a fantastic car.

1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:59.120
I like the DB11 as well.

1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:00.320
And the Vantage.

1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:03.160
But for doing that journey...

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:05.120
-I'd choose the Bentley.
-Wait a minute,

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:08.800
haven't you just recommended
the Aston Martin DBS
to a friend of yours?

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:10.600
-Yes, I have.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:14.240
-And has he since bought one?
-Yes, he has.

1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:15.400
(LAUGHTER)

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:17.400
And on that terrible
disappointment, for him,

1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:20.600
it's time to end. Thank you
so much for watching.
Goodbye!

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.520
(CHEERING)

1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.640
