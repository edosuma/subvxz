00:03.204 --> 00:04.203
Transform your loved one

00:04.204 --> 00:05.203
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:05.206 --> 00:07.657
into a member
of your royal drag family.

00:07.658 --> 00:10.109
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:10.111 --> 00:10.610
(all laugh)

00:10.611 --> 00:11.110
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:11.112 --> 00:11.928
Katya.
- You're giving us something

00:11.929 --> 00:12.745
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:12.747 --> 00:14.380
like they would wear in
Real Housewives of Minsk.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.014
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:16.017 --> 00:16.582

00:16.583 --> 00:17.148
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:17.151 --> 00:18.167

family resemblance.

00:18.168 --> 00:19.184
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:19.186 --> 00:20.319
I mean, it's unbelievable.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.453
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:21.455 --> 00:21.770
- Alaska.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.086
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:22.089 --> 00:23.205
- I think this
was a bit lazy tonight.

00:23.206 --> 00:24.322
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:24.325 --> 00:24.924
I expect more.

00:24.925 --> 00:25.524
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:25.526 --> 00:27.193
- I fucked up this week, man.
I fucked up.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.861
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:28.863 --> 00:30.947
It fucking really
fucking sucks a lot.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.032
- Previously
on "AllStars..."

00:33.534 --> 00:36.869
- Detox,
you're a winner, baby.

00:36.871 --> 00:37.653
(applause)

00:37.654 --> 00:38.436
- Detox,
you're a winner, baby.

00:38.439 --> 00:38.738
- Yay.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.038
- Detox,
you're a winner, baby.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.457
- Which queen have you
chosen to get the chop?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.875
- Detox,
you're a winner, baby.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.578
- I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.296
I can't send him home.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.013
- I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.382
- Alyssa Edwards,
sashay away.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.750
- I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.796
- (sighs)

01:03.798 --> 01:04.447
- Girl.

01:04.448 --> 01:05.097
- (sighs)

01:05.099 --> 01:06.465
"I love you all
always and forever."

01:06.466 --> 01:07.832
- (sighs)

01:07.835 --> 01:09.285
- I can't believe Alyssa
went home.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.736
- (sighs)

01:10.738 --> 01:12.371
- She to me is the most
memorable creature

01:12.372 --> 01:14.005
- (sighs)

01:14.008 --> 01:14.807
to ever walk through
that door.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.607
- (sighs)

01:15.609 --> 01:16.125
- It was
a very tough decision,

01:16.126 --> 01:16.642
- (sighs)

01:16.644 --> 01:17.460
because I was like
how my supposed to say goodbye

01:17.461 --> 01:18.277
- (sighs)

01:18.279 --> 01:18.728
to one of my best friends?

01:18.729 --> 01:19.178
- (sighs)

01:19.180 --> 01:19.745
And it would be like
I'm the one

01:19.746 --> 01:20.311
- (sighs)

01:20.314 --> 01:20.863
who sends
my best friend home.

01:20.864 --> 01:21.413
- (sighs)

01:21.415 --> 01:22.615
- Ru was legitimately gagged

01:22.616 --> 01:23.816
- (sighs)

01:23.818 --> 01:25.134
when you sent Alyssa home.

01:25.135 --> 01:26.451
- (sighs)

01:26.454 --> 01:27.470
- I chose Alyssa.
I'm sorry.

01:27.471 --> 01:28.487
- (sighs)

01:28.489 --> 01:29.205
I can't send him home.

01:29.206 --> 01:29.922
- (sighs)

01:29.924 --> 01:31.407
- It's a controversial
decision.

01:31.408 --> 01:32.891
- (sighs)

01:32.893 --> 01:33.525
Based on the overall
performance,

01:33.526 --> 01:34.158
- (sighs)

01:34.161 --> 01:36.545
Alyssa should have advanced
to the final four, not Roxxxy.

01:36.546 --> 01:38.930
- (sighs)

01:38.933 --> 01:40.466
- So, Katya, I know
that we both had

01:40.467 --> 01:42.000
- (sighs)

01:42.002 --> 01:43.185
a difficult decision
to make.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.369
- (sighs)

01:44.371 --> 01:44.820
- Yes, we did.

01:44.821 --> 01:45.270
- (sighs)

01:45.272 --> 01:46.271
Roxxxy, I chose you.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.271
- (sighs)

01:47.274 --> 01:48.457
And I'm going to look you
in the eye and say this

01:48.458 --> 01:49.641
- (sighs)

01:49.643 --> 01:50.092
so you know that I mean it.

01:50.093 --> 01:50.542
- (sighs)

01:50.544 --> 01:52.328
I do not have a personal
vendetta against you.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.113
- (sighs)

01:54.115 --> 01:55.398
Here's the thing.
I can't send you home.

01:55.399 --> 01:56.682
- (sighs)

01:56.684 --> 01:57.249
You've been slaying
the competition.

01:57.250 --> 01:57.815
- (sighs)

01:57.818 --> 01:59.218
Roxxxy's been in the bottom
so many times.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.619
- (sighs)

02:00.621 --> 02:01.854
I'm going by who I think
is the strongest for the finals,

02:01.855 --> 02:03.088
- (sighs)

02:03.090 --> 02:03.739
and that to me is Alyssa.

02:03.740 --> 02:04.389
- (sighs)

02:04.391 --> 02:05.174
- I'm still here
to prove myself.

02:05.175 --> 02:05.958
- (sighs)

02:05.960 --> 02:06.342
Thank you, Detox.

02:06.343 --> 02:06.725
- (sighs)

02:06.727 --> 02:07.993
Like I'm going to fight
to the bitter end.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.260
- (sighs)

02:09.263 --> 02:10.763
- And you, crazy,
your little temper tantrum,

02:10.764 --> 02:12.264
- (sighs)

02:12.266 --> 02:13.082
I was so surprised.

02:13.083 --> 02:13.899
- (sighs)

02:13.901 --> 02:14.783
- Season 5, I was never
in the bottom two,

02:14.784 --> 02:15.666
- (sighs)

02:15.669 --> 02:17.169
so I was never standing there
having my heart race like that.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.670
- (sighs)

02:18.672 --> 02:20.489
It was really scary seeing
almost this whole thing

02:20.490 --> 02:22.307
- (sighs)

02:22.309 --> 02:23.559
be taken away
in one instant.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.810
- (sighs)

02:24.812 --> 02:26.562
I really wanted and needed

02:26.563 --> 02:28.313
- (sighs)

02:28.315 --> 02:29.498
to be in this final four.

02:29.499 --> 02:30.682
- (sighs)

02:30.684 --> 02:31.333
I need it!

02:31.334 --> 02:31.983
- (sighs)

02:31.986 --> 02:32.752
- Somebody who's going
to win this competition

02:32.753 --> 02:33.519
- (sighs)

02:33.521 --> 02:34.387
is somebody
who can handle themselves

02:34.388 --> 02:35.254
- (sighs)

02:35.256 --> 02:35.988
and still be able
to go out there

02:35.989 --> 02:36.721
- (sighs)

02:36.724 --> 02:37.156
and do their fucking job.

02:37.157 --> 02:37.589
- (sighs)

02:37.591 --> 02:38.240
And right now,
you're crumbling.

02:38.241 --> 02:38.890
- (sighs)

02:38.893 --> 02:39.942
Obviously I want my sisters
to do really well,

02:39.943 --> 02:40.992
- (sighs)

02:40.995 --> 02:42.244
but obviously I want
to do better than them.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.494
- (sighs)

02:43.497 --> 02:44.430
I'm here for the kill.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.364
- (sighs)

02:48.536 --> 02:51.303
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars"

02:51.305 --> 02:51.987

- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.193
their own unique
individual style. Here we go.

05:11.194 --> 05:12.610
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.746
- ¶ I'm Roxxxy Andrews,
and I'm here to make it clear ¶

05:13.747 --> 05:14.880
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.948
¶ I know you love me, baby,
that's why you brought me here ¶

05:15.949 --> 05:17.015
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.116
I'm really feeling
this flow right now, girl.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.216
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.535
You can't tell me
I'm not Nicki Minaj.

05:20.536 --> 05:21.852
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.288
¶ You're going crazy ¶

05:23.289 --> 05:24.722
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.407
¶ And seeing two ¶

05:25.408 --> 05:26.090
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:26.093 --> 05:26.725
- And stop the track.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.358
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.277
Your energy's a little low.

05:28.278 --> 05:29.194
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.263
A little more energy
and a little more sexiness.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.331
- Hi.
- Hi, Roxxxy.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.235
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:37.237 --> 05:38.520
our first guest,
Alaska, the 49th state.

05:38.521 --> 05:39.804
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:39.807 --> 05:41.473
- I'm excited
to do this podcast

05:41.474 --> 05:43.140
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:43.143 --> 05:43.742
with RuPaul and Michelle.

05:43.743 --> 05:44.342
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:44.345 --> 05:46.745
- So what are your wishes
for your career and life

05:46.746 --> 05:49.146
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:49.149 --> 05:50.232
post "AllStars?"

05:50.233 --> 05:51.316
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:51.318 --> 05:51.767
- To create a space

05:51.768 --> 05:52.217
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:52.219 --> 05:54.203
where the rules aren't
so rigid about gender.

05:54.204 --> 05:56.188
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:56.190 --> 05:57.823
And if we can laugh
about it a little more,

05:57.824 --> 05:59.457
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

05:59.460 --> 05:59.858
the world will be better

05:59.859 --> 06:00.257
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:00.260 --> 06:01.593
and we can get
to a "Star Trek" future.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.927
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:02.930 --> 06:04.747
- Hmm, that sounds delicious.
- Yeah.

06:04.748 --> 06:06.565
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:06.567 --> 06:06.982
- I want to talk about

06:06.983 --> 06:07.398
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:07.401 --> 06:08.200
how you were in the bottom
the last challenge,

06:08.201 --> 06:09.000
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:09.002 --> 06:11.620
and I seemed to detect
a little bit of a tantrum.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.239
- Oh, my goodness,
look who's here,

06:16.377 --> 06:18.543
- I'm sorry if I was a brat.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.947
- Now, it looks like
Rolaskatox

06:21.949 --> 06:22.665
is back together again.

06:22.666 --> 06:23.382
- Now, it looks like
Rolaskatox

06:23.384 --> 06:25.885
- Well, we're not actively
practicing Rolaskatox-ism.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.387
- Now, it looks like
Rolaskatox

06:28.389 --> 06:29.922
It's very unnerving
to hear RuPaul

06:29.923 --> 06:31.456
- Now, it looks like
Rolaskatox

06:31.458 --> 06:33.825
saying the dreaded word
Rolaskatox.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.193
- Now, it looks like
Rolaskatox

06:36.630 --> 06:40.866
- We're going to take our
selfieonastick.com selfie.

06:40.868 --> 06:41.333
There you go.

06:41.334 --> 06:41.799
- We're going to take our
selfieonastick.com selfie.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.135
- It's upsetting.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.469
- We're going to take our
selfieonastick.com selfie.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.105
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

06:47.107 --> 06:48.490
¶ So, bitch,
let me show you the door ¶

06:48.491 --> 06:49.874
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

06:49.877 --> 06:51.143
¶ Lenin in the streets,
Dostoyevsky in the streets ¶

06:51.144 --> 06:52.410
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

06:52.413 --> 06:53.445
Oh, fuck I fucked up
that part.

06:53.446 --> 06:54.478
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

06:54.481 --> 06:56.848
I'm like the sugar free
French Vanilla Ice of drag.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.216
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

06:59.219 --> 07:00.068
This is gonna sound great.

07:00.069 --> 07:00.918
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:00.921 --> 07:01.837
Rapping's hard.
- It is hard. Yeah.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.754
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:02.756 --> 07:03.705
- AB's giving me
really good feedback.

07:03.706 --> 07:04.655
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:04.658 --> 07:05.457
He's like
blinking his eyes a lot.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.257
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:06.260 --> 07:07.559
¶ Lenin in the streets,
Dostoyevsky in the sheets ¶

07:07.560 --> 07:08.859
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:08.862 --> 07:10.245
¶ Lenin in the streets,
Dostoyevsky in the sheets ¶

07:10.246 --> 07:11.629
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:11.632 --> 07:13.849
Which I think in Dominican
means, good job.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.067
- ¶ You a basic asshole,
and it's your time to go ¶

07:16.470 --> 07:17.936
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.787
The finale.
- Can you believe it?

07:18.788 --> 07:19.637
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.889
- I pinch myself
every fucking day.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.139
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.258
- And when you pinch yourself,
can you feel it?

07:23.259 --> 07:24.375
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.528
(all laugh)

07:26.529 --> 07:28.679
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.264
You know, it's funny.
Here we are

07:29.265 --> 07:29.847
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.532
at this point
in the competition,

07:30.533 --> 07:31.215
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.118
and here's Rolaskatox
back together again.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.019
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.171
- Ish. Ish.
I love them.

07:36.172 --> 07:37.321
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.440
I mean, there are certain times
when I'm like, oh, okay.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.557
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.209
I don't want to hang out
with you for too long.

07:40.210 --> 07:40.859
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.578
- Now, you've always had your
own look, your own aesthetic,

07:42.579 --> 07:44.296
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.781
but this season
it is so refined.

07:45.782 --> 07:47.265
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.233
Where'd you get
your sense of style?

07:48.234 --> 07:49.200
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:49.203 --> 07:49.768
- Growing up loving
Teri McGlone

07:49.769 --> 07:50.334
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.320
and like
the Vogue Fashion Awards.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.304
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:52.306 --> 07:52.955
I just always loved fashion.

07:52.956 --> 07:53.605
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.122
- Yeah, I can tell.

07:54.123 --> 07:54.638
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.223
- I don't like
to toot my own horn,

07:55.224 --> 07:55.806
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.092
but easily I have killed
everyone in this competition

07:57.093 --> 07:58.376
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:58.378 --> 07:58.844
when it comes to the runway.

07:58.845 --> 07:59.311
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.195
I pissed
all over that thing.

08:00.196 --> 08:01.078
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

08:01.081 --> 08:01.663
- Ready?

08:01.664 --> 08:02.246
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.148
Look. My tits look huge.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.048
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

Okay, here we are.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.754
It was really fun.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.688
- Whoops.
Okay, here we are.

08:09.990 --> 08:15.160
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

- My podcast was consumed

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:22.202 --> 08:22.718

- My podcast was consumed

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:43.790 --> 08:45.307

08:45.308 --> 08:46.825
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:46.827 --> 08:47.509

08:47.510 --> 08:48.192
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:48.195 --> 08:49.211

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:50.230 --> 08:51.847

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:53.467 --> 08:55.033

08:55.034 --> 08:56.600
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

08:59.206 --> 09:00.372

09:00.373 --> 09:01.539
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

09:01.542 --> 09:02.508
because I don't feel
like anything's similar

09:02.509 --> 09:03.475
- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

- My podcast was consumed
by Rolaskatox

Is...

09:48.889 --> 09:51.723
(RuPaul laughs)

09:51.725 --> 09:52.524
- Alaska is flipping out
right now.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.324
(RuPaul laughs)

09:53.327 --> 09:54.760
I need her to just let this
little shit go, girl.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.194
(RuPaul laughs)

09:56.196 --> 09:56.845
You need to fight
to the end.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.495
(RuPaul laughs)

09:57.497 --> 09:58.613
I don't want the bullshit
with the Rolaskatox thing

09:58.614 --> 09:59.730
(RuPaul laughs)

09:59.733 --> 10:01.433
to deter you from what you've
been doing in this competition.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.134
(RuPaul laughs)

10:03.136 --> 10:04.469
- I know.
- Stick to what you're doing.

10:04.470 --> 10:05.803
(RuPaul laughs)

10:05.806 --> 10:06.321
That's stress
you don't need.

10:06.322 --> 10:06.837
(RuPaul laughs)

10:06.840 --> 10:08.974
- I know. It's just...
I know.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.109
(RuPaul laughs)

10:11.111 --> 10:11.693
(sobs)

10:11.694 --> 10:12.276
(RuPaul laughs)

10:12.279 --> 10:14.296
You guys are my friends,
and I love you so much.

10:14.297 --> 10:16.314
(RuPaul laughs)

10:16.316 --> 10:17.382
And I don't want to feel
like that

10:17.383 --> 10:18.449
(RuPaul laughs)

10:18.452 --> 10:20.502
is a disadvantage
to us winning.

10:20.503 --> 10:22.553
(RuPaul laughs)

10:22.556 --> 10:23.305
- Everything
is so different this time.

10:23.306 --> 10:24.055
(RuPaul laughs)

10:24.057 --> 10:25.624
- So just worry about you
getting to the finish line.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.192
(RuPaul laughs)

10:27.194 --> 10:28.810
We love you.

10:28.811 --> 10:30.427
(RuPaul laughs)

10:30.797 --> 10:32.964
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.283
Rolaskatox creates
a reaction in me

10:35.284 --> 10:37.601
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.154
because
it was a stupid thing.

10:39.155 --> 10:40.705
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.623
I can't live in regret.

10:41.624 --> 10:42.540
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.025
In life, really
the only thing you can do

10:44.026 --> 10:45.509
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.362
is take experiences
that are embarrassing

10:47.363 --> 10:49.213
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.984
and turn them into the things
that make you stronger.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.753
- And I really am glad
you're here.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.121
Trash into treasure, girl.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.488
- And I really am glad
you're here.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.494
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:02.496 --> 11:02.928
- Hi.
- Hi, Katya.

11:02.929 --> 11:03.361
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.379
- So now
your mother was here.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.396
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.381
I thought
she was just a dream.

11:06.382 --> 11:07.364
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.266
- Isn't she amazing?
- She really is.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.166
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.352
Thank God dad's a sociopath,
so there's balance.

11:10.353 --> 11:11.536
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:11.538 --> 11:11.937
- Well, there's balance.

11:11.938 --> 11:12.337
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.572
And you know, that's the secret
of life is having a balance.

11:13.573 --> 11:14.806
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.373
- Absolutely.
And you know what?

11:15.374 --> 11:15.939
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.192
This season, it started out
so much better.

11:17.193 --> 11:18.443
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.212
But still, there was
a little bit of like--

11:20.213 --> 11:21.980
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:21.982 --> 11:22.331
- The voices?

11:22.332 --> 11:22.681
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.582
- One thing that I've been
coaching myself with

11:23.583 --> 11:24.482
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.284
is like I sort of
name that voice.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.085
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:28.088 --> 11:28.804
I call her Brenda.

11:28.805 --> 11:29.521
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.055
- Uh-huh.
- And I just say,

11:30.056 --> 11:30.588
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.107
you know what, Brenda?
Shut the fuck up.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.625
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.693
- I love that.
- Yeah, so...

11:34.694 --> 11:35.760
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.461
- I've found
that what you do is

11:36.462 --> 11:37.161
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.764
you develop another voice that
sort of counteracts that voice.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.365
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.366
- Yeah, Carl.
- Wait a minute.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.366
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.285
It's not Hot Carl, is it?

11:43.286 --> 11:44.202
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:44.204 --> 11:44.536
(all laugh)

11:44.537 --> 11:44.869
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.137
- Being excited
to talk with Ru

11:46.138 --> 11:47.404
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.106
is new sensation for me.

11:48.107 --> 11:48.806
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.975
Our rapport is fantastic.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.142
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:51.144 --> 11:51.810
So this is the moment

11:51.811 --> 11:52.477
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.696
that I know how far I've come
in the competition.

11:54.697 --> 11:56.914
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.050
- Gorgeous.
- Yay.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.184
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.202
- Hi-ee.
- Hey, Alaska.

12:00.203 --> 12:01.219
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:01.221 --> 12:01.970
Are you ready?
- I'm so ready.

12:01.971 --> 12:02.720
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.789
I'm excited.
- Yes.

12:03.790 --> 12:04.856
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.574
All right, from the top.

12:05.575 --> 12:06.291
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.626
- ¶ Hey, girls,
my name's Alaska ¶

12:07.627 --> 12:08.960
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.111
¶ I got a tiny little
question to ask ya ¶

12:10.112 --> 12:11.261
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.197
¶ Who's that bitch
that's on the top? ¶

12:12.198 --> 12:13.131
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.399
¶ Oh, wait, that's me,
hey, porkchop ¶

12:14.400 --> 12:15.666
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:15.669 --> 12:16.985
- And cut. I love
your signature Alaska sound,

12:16.986 --> 12:18.302
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.321
but make it a little bit
more animated.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.338
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.690
- Today's been really
emotional for me,

12:21.691 --> 12:23.041
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.326
but I have to get back
in the game.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.610
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.230
I need to come in
absolutely nothing held back.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.849
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.316
- Cue music.

12:31.317 --> 12:31.782
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.634
- ¶ Legacy,
remember my name ¶

12:32.635 --> 12:33.484
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:33.487 --> 12:37.239
¶ 'Cause you're gonna see me
hanging in the hall of fame ¶

12:37.240 --> 12:40.992
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:40.994 --> 12:41.910
- So good.
I love that.

12:41.911 --> 12:42.827
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:42.829 --> 12:43.545
- Hi, Roxxxy.

12:43.546 --> 12:44.262
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:44.264 --> 12:44.930
- So now,
how are you different

12:44.931 --> 12:45.597
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.598
than you were whenever
you were here before?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.598
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.383
I have no idea
how long ago that was

12:48.384 --> 12:49.166
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:49.169 --> 12:49.951
because I have
no concept of time.

12:49.952 --> 12:50.734
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.187
- I realized that you have
to live with your mistakes

12:52.188 --> 12:53.638
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.289
and you have to grow
from them.

12:54.290 --> 12:54.939
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.375
- I know that you didn't like
how you came off in that season

12:57.376 --> 12:59.810
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

12:59.813 --> 13:00.595
'cause all these bitches
want to say,

13:00.596 --> 13:01.378
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.447
oh, I was edited
unfavorably.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.514
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:03.517 --> 13:04.900
It's like, no, bitch,
you said it, you did it,

13:04.901 --> 13:06.284
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:06.286 --> 13:06.701
that's how it was.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.117
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.436
- I own up to everything
I said on the show.

13:08.437 --> 13:09.753
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.972
I couldn't believe
how messy I got.

13:10.973 --> 13:12.189
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.508
So coming onto "AllStars,"
it was like the--

13:13.509 --> 13:14.825
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:14.828 --> 13:15.560
oh, my God,
I got a second chance.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.293
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.212
- When you have your eye
on the prize,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.129
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:18.131 --> 13:18.630
you do whatever it takes
to win.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.130
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.248
And sometimes, it's not
the nicest move, but you do it.

13:20.249 --> 13:21.365
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.234
- What's funny
about this whole interview

13:22.235 --> 13:23.101
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.619
is you've said nothing about
seeing my makeup this close.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.136
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.822
- It's hard to look at you,
you're so beautiful, stunning.

13:27.823 --> 13:29.506
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.525
- Why, thank you. Jeez,
it's like pulling teeth

13:30.526 --> 13:31.542
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:31.545 --> 13:32.778
to get a compliment
out of these girls.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.012
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.514
Ooh, child.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.015
- Oh, my goodness.
Look who just walked in.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.284
- This is my crowning look.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.385
- (laughs)
- What are you thinking about?

13:40.386 --> 13:41.485
- This is my crowning look.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.538
- What if
Roxxxy Andrews wins?

13:43.539 --> 13:45.589
- This is my crowning look.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.691
- Um, I would be confused.

13:46.692 --> 13:47.791
- This is my crowning look.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.010
- If she wins, it's gonna be
a fucking uproar.

13:49.011 --> 13:50.227
- This is my crowning look.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.898
- If we're racking up points,
then no, she's not going to win.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.567
- This is my crowning look.

13:55.569 --> 13:56.501
- Mm-hmm.
- I won three.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.434
- This is my crowning look.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.320
I was in the bottom
two times.

13:58.321 --> 13:59.204
- This is my crowning look.

13:59.206 --> 13:59.871
- I was in the bottom
one time.

13:59.872 --> 14:00.537
- This is my crowning look.

14:00.540 --> 14:00.989
I've won three challenges.

14:00.990 --> 14:01.439
- This is my crowning look.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.541
And your track record has
been bottom once, won four.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.642
- This is my crowning look.

14:05.645 --> 14:05.910
- Yeah.

14:05.911 --> 14:06.176
- This is my crowning look.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.195
- But it's not going to be
a math equation.

14:07.196 --> 14:08.212
- This is my crowning look.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.147
I mean, or maybe it is,
I don't know.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.080
- This is my crowning look.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.733
- I won the most, but winning
doesn't make you likeable.

14:11.734 --> 14:13.384
- This is my crowning look.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.903
And I've been very focused
and I've been very driven,

14:14.904 --> 14:16.421
- This is my crowning look.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.305
but those aren't
likeable qualities.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.188
- This is my crowning look.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.408
Having passion and having drive
is a double-edged sword.

14:20.409 --> 14:22.626
- This is my crowning look.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.079
It's easy to look cutthroat
and ambitious,

14:24.080 --> 14:25.530
- This is my crowning look.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.682
but on the other hand, it's
the biggest strength I have.

14:27.683 --> 14:29.833
- This is my crowning look.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.252
- If you didn't win,
would you be devastated?

14:31.253 --> 14:32.669
- This is my crowning look.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.972
- Well, I mean,
I've been there before.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.273
- This is my crowning look.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.341
But I want to win.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.408
- This is my crowning look.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.743
How about you?

14:38.744 --> 14:40.077
- This is my crowning look.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.396
- I want to win.

14:41.397 --> 14:42.713
- This is my crowning look.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.683
- Me, too.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.620
- From the top.

14:48.622 --> 14:49.755
¶ Detox coming at you
with a slow verse ¶

14:49.756 --> 14:50.889
- From the top.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.057
¶ Imma speed it up,
I had to shut it down first ¶

14:52.058 --> 14:53.224
- From the top.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.509
I feel really confident
about this rap challenge.

14:54.510 --> 14:55.793
- From the top.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.111
And the only thing that's
holding me back would be myself,

14:57.112 --> 14:58.428
- From the top.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.180
and I don't plan
on holding myself back.

14:59.181 --> 14:59.930
- From the top.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.883
¶ D to the E to the T to
the O to the--hold it-- ¶

15:01.884 --> 15:03.834
- From the top.

15:03.837 --> 15:04.135
¶ X ¶

15:04.136 --> 15:04.434
- From the top.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.554
- Detox is definitely the
strongest queen I've seen today.

15:06.555 --> 15:08.672
- From the top.

15:08.675 --> 15:09.357
Oh, my God, so good.

15:09.358 --> 15:10.040
- From the top.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.076
- I feel so gangsta,
you guys.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.110
- From the top.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.028
- Yeah.

15:13.029 --> 15:13.945
- From the top.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.848
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:16.850 --> 15:17.215
- Hi-ee.
- Yeah.

15:17.216 --> 15:17.581
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:17.584 --> 15:19.267
- It's time for us
to learn our choreography

15:19.268 --> 15:20.951
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:20.954 --> 15:21.453
for our stage performance

15:21.454 --> 15:21.953
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:21.955 --> 15:23.788
with choreographer
to the stars Travis Wall.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.622
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:25.625 --> 15:26.925
- Obviously, there's so much
riding on this performance,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.226
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:28.228 --> 15:28.677
so what I'd like to do now

15:28.678 --> 15:29.127
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:29.129 --> 15:30.228
is work with you individually
on your solo parts.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.328
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:31.331 --> 15:32.330
Today, we are doing
lots of choreography.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.330
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:33.333 --> 15:33.999
There's a couple props
involved.

15:34.000 --> 15:34.666
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:34.668 --> 15:35.233
We're pulling out
all the stops,

15:35.234 --> 15:35.799
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:35.802 --> 15:37.018
and this has to be
a showstopping performance.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.235
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:38.238 --> 15:39.921
Pick her up
and get her legs in the air.

15:39.922 --> 15:41.605
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:41.608 --> 15:42.424
- (laughs)

15:42.425 --> 15:43.241
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:43.243 --> 15:44.659
I love Alaska, but we all know
she can't dance for shit.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.076
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:46.079 --> 15:47.545
- We just look like
a chicken a little bit.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.012
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:49.015 --> 15:50.064
Are you flexible?
- A little.

15:50.065 --> 15:51.114
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:51.117 --> 15:51.783
- Maybe.
- What do you want me to do?

15:51.784 --> 15:52.450
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:52.452 --> 15:52.851
- I want you to see

15:52.852 --> 15:53.251
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:53.253 --> 15:54.069
if you can get into
a middle split

15:54.070 --> 15:54.886
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:54.888 --> 15:56.021
on top of him again.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.155
- Yes.
(both laugh)

15:58.191 --> 16:00.892
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.394
- Flick, flick,
and then split.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.895
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.347
(all laugh)

16:05.348 --> 16:06.798
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.517
One, three, five, seven,
one--

16:09.518 --> 16:12.235
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:12.238 --> 16:12.704
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:12.705 --> 16:13.171
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.522
As excited as I am to do
this whole chair routine,

16:14.523 --> 16:15.872
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.158
the minute I'm up on the chairs,
I start freaking out.

16:17.159 --> 16:18.442
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:18.445 --> 16:18.710
Oh, God.

16:18.711 --> 16:18.976
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.328
- I want you to fall
backwards this way.

16:20.329 --> 16:21.678
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.064
- Okay. So just trust
these motherfuckers.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.448
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.000
- Yes.
- Okay.

16:25.001 --> 16:25.550
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.901
It looks easy,
but it's really not.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.251
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.253
- Shenae over to him.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.253
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.773
Shenae. Wrong foot.

16:31.774 --> 16:33.291
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:33.293 --> 16:33.992
Left leg. Your left leg.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.692
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.543
What would you do to him
to get your attention?

16:35.544 --> 16:36.393
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.929
- A lot of things.
(all laugh)

16:37.930 --> 16:39.463
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.031
- Why don't you
get behind him.

16:40.032 --> 16:40.597
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.282
- It's my favorite place.

16:41.283 --> 16:41.965
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:41.968 --> 16:42.383
- Maybe push him down.

16:42.384 --> 16:42.799
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.335
- Down into this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.869
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.338
- Choreography is hard.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.805
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:48.808 --> 16:49.891
I need some duct tape.

16:49.892 --> 16:50.975
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:50.977 --> 16:51.709
- I've never worked
with you, Katya.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.442
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.544
- Yep. I'm not
an actual dancer,

16:53.545 --> 16:54.644
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.114
but I am extremely flexible.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.582
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.166
Oh, Jesus Christ.

16:58.167 --> 16:58.749
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.285
- The idea is you're going
to slide into your right split

17:00.286 --> 17:01.819
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:01.821 --> 17:02.270
and then bring you up.

17:02.271 --> 17:02.720
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:02.722 --> 17:03.838
You want to try that?
- Yeah.

17:03.839 --> 17:04.955
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:04.958 --> 17:05.924
- Slide and up. Nice.

17:05.925 --> 17:06.891
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:06.893 --> 17:07.709
- We can even go lower
than that, you guys.

17:07.710 --> 17:08.526
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:08.528 --> 17:08.910
- There you go.

17:08.911 --> 17:09.293
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.778
Slide and up.
Amazing. Love that.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.262
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:12.265 --> 17:12.847
- Shit, oh, my God.

17:12.848 --> 17:13.430
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.949
- Five, six, seven,
plie shoon.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.466
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.719
- Oh, that feels
fucking sexy.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.970
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:18.972 --> 17:19.738
(all laugh)
- Oh, my God.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.505
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.289
Katya is like
a fucking rubber band.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.072
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.108
It's very intimidating
because it's something

17:23.109 --> 17:24.142
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.710
that's going to be
very memorable to the judges.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.277
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.496
- Handstand.

17:28.497 --> 17:29.713
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.465
Put your legs together.
There you go.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.215
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.100
Now open and go down.
There you go.

17:32.101 --> 17:32.984
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.019
- Oh, that's fun.
Let's do it again.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.053
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.621
- Great job.
Yeah, so good.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.188
- Okay.
That's ambitious.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.062
- Shit, fuck
mother fuck shit.

17:44.964 --> 17:45.630
- Coming up...

17:45.632 --> 17:46.481
- What was
your favorite moment?

17:46.482 --> 17:47.331
- Coming up...

17:47.333 --> 17:48.533
- When you were in
the bottom two, Roxxxy.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.734
- Coming up...

17:49.736 --> 17:50.635
- Oh!
- Fuck!

17:50.636 --> 17:51.535
- Coming up...

17:51.538 --> 17:52.854
(RuPaul laugh)

17:52.855 --> 17:54.171
- Coming up...

17:54.974 --> 17:57.842
(RuPaul laughs)

17:59.879 --> 18:00.678
- Yeah.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.547
(speaking French)

18:02.548 --> 18:04.415
- Yeah.

18:04.417 --> 18:04.999
- This is our final day.

18:05.000 --> 18:05.582
- Yeah.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.334
At this point
of the competition,

18:06.335 --> 18:07.084
- Yeah.

18:07.087 --> 18:07.819
there's no holding back.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.552
- Yeah.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.120
I don't know
who I gotta move,

18:09.121 --> 18:09.686
- Yeah.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.172
but I'm going full force
to that win.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.656
- Yeah.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.426
How do you feel, Katya?

18:15.428 --> 18:15.860
- Um, I feel good.

18:15.861 --> 18:16.293
How do you feel, Katya?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.829
I think one of the things that
I'm most proud of myself for

18:17.830 --> 18:19.363
How do you feel, Katya?

18:19.365 --> 18:20.331
is making it this far
with you guys

18:20.332 --> 18:21.298
How do you feel, Katya?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.134
because I haven't had
as much experience

18:23.135 --> 18:24.968
How do you feel, Katya?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.604
as a professional
post Drag Race girl.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.238
How do you feel, Katya?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.057
Do you know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

18:29.058 --> 18:29.874
How do you feel, Katya?

18:29.876 --> 18:30.775
- I feel like in the short time
since my season,

18:30.776 --> 18:31.675
How do you feel, Katya?

18:31.678 --> 18:32.677
I've already grown so much.

18:32.678 --> 18:33.677
How do you feel, Katya?

18:33.680 --> 18:34.412
And I want to win
"AllStars,"

18:34.413 --> 18:35.145
How do you feel, Katya?

18:35.148 --> 18:36.598
and objective, scientific
research has shown

18:36.599 --> 18:38.049
How do you feel, Katya?

18:38.051 --> 18:39.584
that it is totally possible
for me to do that.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.118
How do you feel, Katya?

18:41.121 --> 18:42.203
What about you, Alaska?
What are you feeling?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.286
How do you feel, Katya?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.490
- I feel good about how I've
performed in the competition.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.692
How do you feel, Katya?

18:47.694 --> 18:49.727
I've had moments of going
a little fucking crazy,

18:49.728 --> 18:51.761
How do you feel, Katya?

18:51.764 --> 18:52.964
and I apologize
to all of you

18:52.965 --> 18:54.165
How do you feel, Katya?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.717
if that fucked up
the energy of the room

18:55.718 --> 18:57.268
How do you feel, Katya?

18:57.270 --> 18:58.553
and of this experience.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.837
How do you feel, Katya?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.139
I was trying to stay
so focused,

19:01.140 --> 19:02.440
How do you feel, Katya?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.726
and I didn't want to show
any signs of weakness.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.011
How do you feel, Katya?

19:07.013 --> 19:07.378
One of the things

19:07.379 --> 19:07.744
How do you feel, Katya?

19:07.747 --> 19:08.546
that I wish
I would've done differently

19:08.547 --> 19:09.346
How do you feel, Katya?

19:09.349 --> 19:12.484
is I wish I wouldn't
have been quite so serious.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.620
How do you feel, Katya?

19:15.622 --> 19:16.521
I'm absurd and I'm obsessed,

19:16.522 --> 19:17.421
How do you feel, Katya?

19:17.423 --> 19:19.674
but I think I'm the best
RuPaul's Drag Race queen ever.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.926
How do you feel, Katya?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.144
So I want to win.

19:23.145 --> 19:24.361
How do you feel, Katya?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.246
It's my destiny.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.129
How do you feel, Katya?

19:26.132 --> 19:26.681

19:26.682 --> 19:27.231
How do you feel, Katya?

19:27.233 --> 19:27.648
- I feel really good.

19:27.649 --> 19:28.064
How do you feel, Katya?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.600
Like, I feel very confident in
everything that I've done here.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.134
How do you feel, Katya?

19:31.137 --> 19:32.120
I feel like myself,
which is the first time

19:32.121 --> 19:33.104
How do you feel, Katya?

19:33.106 --> 19:34.939
I've felt like truly me
in a long time.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.773
How do you feel, Katya?

19:36.776 --> 19:37.775
I would love to say
that if I did not win,

19:37.776 --> 19:38.775
How do you feel, Katya?

19:38.778 --> 19:39.711
that it would be fine.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.645
How do you feel, Katya?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.447
But to get this far and to be
so proud of what I've done

19:42.448 --> 19:44.248
How do you feel, Katya?

19:44.250 --> 19:45.833
and then to still
just miss the mark

19:45.834 --> 19:47.417
How do you feel, Katya?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.002
would be devastating.

19:48.003 --> 19:48.585
How do you feel, Katya?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.221
It's been an amazing experience,
and now I just feel bad

19:50.222 --> 19:51.855
How do you feel, Katya?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.408
that I'm going to have
to crush you guys' dreams.

19:59.181 --> 19:59.596

when it all caught up
with you a little bit,

What did you say in your rap?

28:27.089 --> 28:28.105
First up, Alaska.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.340
- It's a rash,
not a herpes sore.

First up, Alaska.

your sense of humor

28:33.979 --> 28:34.678

the whole season.

28:35.830 --> 28:36.979
First up, Alaska.

28:36.982 --> 28:37.531
And it's always
a little bit off.

28:37.532 --> 28:38.081
First up, Alaska.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.001

is part of why we love Katya,

28:40.002 --> 28:41.919
First up, Alaska.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.170
but it doesn't justify
this skirt.

28:43.171 --> 28:44.420
First up, Alaska.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.172
Um, so...

28:45.173 --> 28:45.922
First up, Alaska.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.792
First up, Alaska.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.094
we've seen it done before,
but neither are you, honey,

28:50.095 --> 28:51.395
First up, Alaska.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.179
and that's why we like you.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.936
First up, Alaska.

First up, Alaska.

29:03.042 --> 29:03.307

29:04.926 --> 29:06.275
First up, Alaska.

29:06.278 --> 29:06.860
but I thought
you had fun with it

29:08.614 --> 29:09.029
- So much.
- Yeah.

29:09.030 --> 29:09.445
First up, Alaska.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.197
- When that fan came on,
I was sold.

29:10.198 --> 29:10.947
First up, Alaska.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.600
- I'm such a sucker for
a this way and a that way

29:12.601 --> 29:14.251
First up, Alaska.

29:14.253 --> 29:14.935
and just--I'm so jealous.

29:14.936 --> 29:15.618
First up, Alaska.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.688
Someone clip an extension on me
stat so I can try it.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.756
First up, Alaska.

29:20.793 --> 29:24.795
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:24.797 --> 29:25.479
looking at the four of you.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.162
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:26.165 --> 29:27.615
And I couldn't be more proud

29:27.616 --> 29:29.066
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:29.068 --> 29:30.551
to know that you
are part my legacy,

29:30.552 --> 29:32.035
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:32.037 --> 29:33.704
seeing each of you
so beautiful.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.372
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:35.374 --> 29:36.290
And I'm telling you
right now,

29:36.291 --> 29:37.207
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:37.209 --> 29:39.960
I feel so confident to pass
my torch on to the four of you.

29:39.961 --> 29:42.712
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:42.715 --> 29:44.915
No matter what happens
on this stage tonight,

29:44.916 --> 29:47.116
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:47.119 --> 29:49.019
you are a star forever.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.920
- Ladies, I am overcome
with emotion right now

29:53.325 --> 29:55.359
Coming up...
One final question.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.762
Why should you
and not your fellow AllStars

29:57.763 --> 30:00.164
Coming up...
One final question.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.166
be inducted into
the Drag Race Hall of Fame?

30:02.167 --> 30:04.167
Coming up...
One final question.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.471
(RuPaul laughs)

30:08.274 --> 30:10.774
(RuPaul laughs)

30:10.776 --> 30:12.176
- Ladies,
one final question.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.577
(RuPaul laughs)

30:13.579 --> 30:15.829
Why should you
and not your fellow AllStars

30:15.830 --> 30:18.080
(RuPaul laughs)

30:18.083 --> 30:20.534
be inducted into
the Drag Race Hall of Fame?

30:20.535 --> 30:22.986
(RuPaul laughs)

30:24.924 --> 30:25.656
Alaska.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.690
- Yes, I've thrown fits.

30:26.691 --> 30:27.723
Alaska.

30:27.726 --> 30:28.275
I've thrown tantrums.

30:28.276 --> 30:28.825
Alaska.

30:28.828 --> 30:31.312
Perhaps I'm just a RuPaul's
Drag Race obsessed super fan.

30:31.313 --> 30:33.797
Alaska.

30:33.799 --> 30:36.100
Was I obsessed when Chanel
was Miss Absolute Mandarin?

30:36.101 --> 30:38.402
Alaska.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.637
(slurps)

30:39.638 --> 30:40.871
Alaska.

30:40.873 --> 30:41.488
Yes, God.

30:41.489 --> 30:42.104
Alaska.

30:42.107 --> 30:43.423
Was I obsessed when India,
Farrah and Phoenix

30:43.424 --> 30:44.740
Alaska.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.076
walked into the workroom in the
same wig and the same outfit?

30:46.077 --> 30:47.410
Alaska.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.097
In the words of Gia Gunn,
absolutely.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.782
Alaska.

30:52.785 --> 30:53.534
For it is
my fanatical devotion

30:53.535 --> 30:54.284
Alaska.

30:54.286 --> 30:55.085
and my undying love
and respect

30:55.086 --> 30:55.885
Alaska.

30:55.888 --> 30:56.687
for the world that RuPaul
has created here

30:56.688 --> 30:57.487
Alaska.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.239
that puts me wig, head and
shoulders above any competitor.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.990
Alaska.

31:00.993 --> 31:01.926
- Oh, my God.
- Look into your hearts

31:01.927 --> 31:02.860
Alaska.

31:02.862 --> 31:04.495
where you will find
that the only inductee

31:04.496 --> 31:06.129
Alaska.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.447
into the RuPaul's Drag Race
Hall of Fame

31:07.448 --> 31:08.764
Alaska.

31:08.767 --> 31:09.650
is I, Alaska.

31:09.651 --> 31:10.534
Alaska.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.653
Hallelujah!
Yes, God! Oh, brrr!

31:12.654 --> 31:14.771
Alaska.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.490
(laughter and applause)

31:16.491 --> 31:18.208
Alaska.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.843
- All right.
Detox, same question.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.477
Alaska.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.796
- All I can say is how
magical of an experience

31:22.797 --> 31:24.113
Alaska.

31:24.116 --> 31:24.515
this has been to me.

31:24.516 --> 31:24.915
Alaska.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.167
It's been full of joy and tears
and perseverance.

31:27.168 --> 31:29.418
Alaska.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.904
And I don't want to throw
these girls under the bus,

31:30.905 --> 31:32.388
Alaska.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.340
but...

31:33.341 --> 31:34.290
Alaska.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.010
I will say that I feel like
I have shown

31:36.011 --> 31:37.728
Alaska.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.080
such an amount of growth
and maturity and humility

31:40.081 --> 31:42.431
Alaska.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.750
that I want to just
travel around the world

31:43.751 --> 31:45.067
Alaska.

31:45.070 --> 31:45.986
and share that with everyone

31:45.987 --> 31:46.903
Alaska.

31:46.906 --> 31:47.471
and say that
it will get better.

31:47.472 --> 31:48.037
Alaska.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.456
No matter how crazy or weird
you may be,

31:49.457 --> 31:50.873
Alaska.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.393
that I could be some kind
of beacon of hope

31:52.394 --> 31:53.911
Alaska.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.146
for all those weirdoes
out there.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.380
Alaska.

31:56.382 --> 31:57.348
And thank you.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.315
Alaska.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.853
(all laugh)

32:02.855 --> 32:03.120
- Katya.

32:03.121 --> 32:03.386
(all laugh)

32:03.389 --> 32:05.039
- (Russian accent)
Charisma, uniqueness,

32:05.040 --> 32:06.690
(all laugh)

32:06.692 --> 32:07.474
nerve, talent.

32:07.475 --> 32:08.257
(all laugh)

32:08.260 --> 32:09.760
What do these qualities
have in common?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.261
(all laugh)

32:11.263 --> 32:12.729
I don't know.
I'm not a scientist.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.196
(all laugh)

32:14.199 --> 32:14.698
(all laugh)

32:14.699 --> 32:15.198
(all laugh)

32:15.200 --> 32:15.882
I stand here

32:15.883 --> 32:16.565
(all laugh)

32:16.568 --> 32:18.568
a charismatic woman
of grace and dignity

32:18.569 --> 32:20.569
(all laugh)

32:20.572 --> 32:22.623
with a unique sense of humor
and point of view.

32:22.624 --> 32:24.675
(all laugh)

32:24.677 --> 32:27.745
(no accent) In Season 7,
you let me show the world

32:27.746 --> 32:30.814
(all laugh)

32:30.816 --> 32:32.816
that I'm good enough,

32:32.817 --> 32:34.817
(all laugh)

32:34.820 --> 32:37.004
and here...

32:37.005 --> 32:39.189
(all laugh)

32:39.191 --> 32:41.575
you let me
believe it myself,

32:41.576 --> 32:43.960
(all laugh)

32:43.963 --> 32:46.280
and I can't thank you enough
for that.

32:46.281 --> 32:48.598
(all laugh)

32:48.600 --> 32:49.683
Like they say in Russia...

32:49.684 --> 32:50.767
(all laugh)

32:50.769 --> 32:53.086
(speaking Russian)

32:53.087 --> 32:55.404
(all laugh)

32:55.407 --> 32:56.256
- What does that mean?

32:56.257 --> 32:57.106
(all laugh)

32:57.109 --> 32:57.624
- I have
a carburetor outside

32:57.625 --> 32:58.140
(all laugh)

32:58.143 --> 32:59.560
that I just have to do
some work on.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.978
(all laugh)

33:00.980 --> 33:02.696
(all laugh)

33:02.697 --> 33:04.413
(all laugh)

33:04.416 --> 33:05.115
- Thank you, Katya.

33:05.116 --> 33:05.815
(all laugh)

33:05.818 --> 33:06.650
- Thank you.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.483
(all laugh)

33:07.486 --> 33:08.268
- All right, Roxxxy,
same question.

33:08.269 --> 33:09.051
(all laugh)

33:09.054 --> 33:11.722
- I came onto "AllStars"
to prove to America and myself

33:11.723 --> 33:14.391
(all laugh)

33:14.393 --> 33:16.193
that I can compete
and do it the right way.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.994
(all laugh)

33:17.997 --> 33:18.796
And if you decide
to crown me,

33:18.797 --> 33:19.596
(all laugh)

33:19.598 --> 33:21.098
I just want you to know
that I will never give up.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.599
(all laugh)

33:22.601 --> 33:23.884
I'll always keep fighting
and, you know,

33:23.885 --> 33:25.168
(all laugh)

33:25.170 --> 33:26.770
I can stand here
so proud of myself.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.371
(all laugh)

33:28.374 --> 33:29.306
I won
when I walked in the door,

33:29.307 --> 33:30.239
(all laugh)

33:30.242 --> 33:31.925
and every week after that,
I was winning.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.609
(all laugh)

33:33.612 --> 33:33.994
(sobs)

33:33.995 --> 33:34.377
(all laugh)

33:34.380 --> 33:35.996
I can't tell you not to crown
one of these three girls

33:35.997 --> 33:37.613
(all laugh)

33:37.616 --> 33:38.582
because
they're so phenomenal.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.549
(all laugh)

33:39.551 --> 33:40.917
But I want you to crown me.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.284
(all laugh)

33:42.287 --> 33:43.203
(all laugh)

33:43.204 --> 33:44.120
(all laugh)

33:44.123 --> 33:45.122
- Thank you, ladies.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.122
(all laugh)

33:46.125 --> 33:46.707
I think we've heard enough.

33:46.708 --> 33:47.290
(all laugh)

33:47.292 --> 33:48.475
While you untuck
in the workroom,

33:48.476 --> 33:49.659
(all laugh)

33:49.661 --> 33:50.610
for the first time
this season,

33:50.611 --> 33:51.560
(all laugh)

33:51.563 --> 33:53.013
the judges and I
will deliberate.

33:53.014 --> 33:54.464
(all laugh)

33:54.900 --> 33:56.933
Just between us girlfriends,

33:56.935 --> 33:58.285
let's just break
the shit down, okay?

33:58.286 --> 33:59.636
Just between us girlfriends,

33:59.638 --> 33:59.937
Alaska.

33:59.938 --> 34:00.237
Just between us girlfriends,

34:00.239 --> 34:01.005
- Every single week,
she's come

34:01.006 --> 34:01.772
Just between us girlfriends,

34:01.774 --> 34:02.756
and she has slayed
the competition.

34:02.757 --> 34:03.739
Just between us girlfriends,

34:03.742 --> 34:04.808
- She understands
how Snatch Game works.

34:04.809 --> 34:05.875
Just between us girlfriends,

34:05.878 --> 34:06.844
Either you know it
or you don't.

34:06.845 --> 34:07.811
Just between us girlfriends,

34:07.813 --> 34:08.762
- Yep.
- And she got it.

34:08.763 --> 34:09.712
Just between us girlfriends,

34:09.715 --> 34:10.664
- She's so prepared,
so smart.

34:10.665 --> 34:11.614
Just between us girlfriends,

34:11.617 --> 34:12.800
Her Bette Davis
was off the chart.

34:12.801 --> 34:13.984
Just between us girlfriends,

34:13.986 --> 34:14.802
- What I didn't expect
from Alaska

34:14.803 --> 34:15.619
Just between us girlfriends,

34:15.621 --> 34:17.938
was when she fell that she would
be so bitter or childlike.

34:17.939 --> 34:20.256
Just between us girlfriends,

34:20.259 --> 34:21.241
- Yes, she had a bad week
when her mom was here,

34:21.242 --> 34:22.224
Just between us girlfriends,

34:22.227 --> 34:22.993
but if you go
by the numbers,

34:22.994 --> 34:23.760
Just between us girlfriends,

34:23.762 --> 34:25.395
she would probably still
get a 98 out of 100.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.029
Just between us girlfriends,

34:27.032 --> 34:28.432
- She is a package.
She is ready for it.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.833
Just between us girlfriends,

34:29.835 --> 34:31.101
- Let's talk about Detox.

34:31.102 --> 34:32.368
Just between us girlfriends,

34:32.371 --> 34:33.120
- From a fashion
sensibility point,

34:33.121 --> 34:33.870
Just between us girlfriends,

34:33.872 --> 34:34.788
she blew everybody
out of the water.

34:34.789 --> 34:35.705
Just between us girlfriends,

34:35.707 --> 34:38.608
Every look, week after week,
told a story and told it well.

34:38.609 --> 34:41.510
Just between us girlfriends,

34:41.513 --> 34:41.912
- I could see Detox

34:41.913 --> 34:42.312
Just between us girlfriends,

34:42.314 --> 34:43.497
being the creative director
of a fashion house

34:43.498 --> 34:44.681
Just between us girlfriends,

34:44.683 --> 34:45.749
because she's got
that kind of an eye.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.816
Just between us girlfriends,

34:46.819 --> 34:48.369
- I like to watch somebody
who makes me feel something.

34:48.370 --> 34:49.920
Just between us girlfriends,

34:49.922 --> 34:51.288
- She shows her heart
and her ass.

34:51.289 --> 34:52.655
Just between us girlfriends,

34:52.658 --> 34:53.424
- Yes, she does.
- Yes.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.191
Just between us girlfriends,

34:54.193 --> 34:55.509
- All right.
Let's talk about Katya.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.826
Just between us girlfriends,

34:56.829 --> 34:59.296
I mean, what a difference
from Season 7 to "AllStars."

34:59.297 --> 35:01.764
Just between us girlfriends,

35:01.767 --> 35:02.499
- I love how zany she is.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.232
Just between us girlfriends,

35:03.235 --> 35:04.051
I love that she takes risks.

35:04.052 --> 35:04.868
Just between us girlfriends,

35:04.870 --> 35:05.452
- It's funny
and it's quirky,

35:05.453 --> 35:06.035
Just between us girlfriends,

35:06.038 --> 35:07.237
but it's a very smart
sense of humor.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.437
Just between us girlfriends,

35:08.440 --> 35:09.489
- And she does it
in a fun, fresh way

35:09.490 --> 35:10.539
Just between us girlfriends,

35:10.542 --> 35:11.775
that invites everyone
to the party.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.009
Just between us girlfriends,

35:13.011 --> 35:13.844
- And the potential
is endless, really.

35:13.845 --> 35:14.678
Just between us girlfriends,

35:14.680 --> 35:15.546
- Endless.
Roxxxy Andrews.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.413
Just between us girlfriends,

35:16.415 --> 35:18.248
- I think she's kinder, softer,
sweeter and more polished.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.082
Just between us girlfriends,

35:20.085 --> 35:21.485
And she was even
really polished in Season 5.

35:21.486 --> 35:22.886
Just between us girlfriends,

35:22.888 --> 35:23.487
- She was.
- Yeah.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.087
Just between us girlfriends,

35:24.089 --> 35:24.538
Not the greatest actress,

35:24.539 --> 35:24.988
Just between us girlfriends,

35:24.990 --> 35:26.173
but I could look at her
all day long.

35:26.174 --> 35:27.357
Just between us girlfriends,

35:27.359 --> 35:28.108
- She's been
in the bottom five times,

35:28.109 --> 35:28.858
Just between us girlfriends,

35:28.861 --> 35:31.245
but she's one of those girls
that have such stage presence,

35:31.246 --> 35:33.630
Just between us girlfriends,

35:33.632 --> 35:34.131
even if she's sucking,

35:34.132 --> 35:34.631
Just between us girlfriends,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.867
you can't take your eyes
off of her.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.102
Just between us girlfriends,

35:39.104 --> 35:40.554
- All right. Silence!

35:40.555 --> 35:42.005
Just between us girlfriends,

35:42.007 --> 35:43.190
I've made my decision.

35:43.191 --> 35:44.374
Just between us girlfriends,

35:44.376 --> 35:45.792
Bring back my girls.

35:45.793 --> 35:47.209
Just between us girlfriends,

35:47.212 --> 35:48.412
(RuPaul laughs)

35:48.413 --> 35:49.613
Just between us girlfriends,

35:50.449 --> 35:52.983
(RuPaul laughs)

35:56.822 --> 35:58.188
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.823
The winner of "AllStars"
will be inducted

35:59.824 --> 36:01.457
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.409
into the Drag Race
Hall of Fame,

36:02.410 --> 36:03.359
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:03.362 --> 36:06.230
receive a crown and scepter
designed by Fierce Drag Jewels,

36:06.231 --> 36:09.099
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:09.101 --> 36:12.085
and win a grand prize
of $100,000.

36:12.086 --> 36:15.070
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:15.307 --> 36:21.077
Ladies, each week
I've named the top two AllStars,

36:21.079 --> 36:22.612
but after
this final deliberation,

36:22.613 --> 36:24.146
Ladies, each week
I've named the top two AllStars,

36:24.149 --> 36:25.649
three of you
have earned the right

36:25.650 --> 36:27.150
Ladies, each week
I've named the top two AllStars,

36:27.152 --> 36:29.119
to lip sync for your legacy.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.087
Ladies, each week
I've named the top two AllStars,

36:34.159 --> 36:37.027
Alaska.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.562
Detox.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.096
Alaska.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.401
Katya.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.720
You are the top three
AllStars of the season.

36:46.721 --> 36:49.038
Katya.

36:51.944 --> 36:55.812
Roxxxy, my dear,
this is not your time,

36:55.814 --> 36:58.899
but you are and will
always be an AllStar.

36:58.900 --> 37:01.985
Roxxxy, my dear,
this is not your time,

37:01.987 --> 37:04.121
Now sashay away.

37:04.122 --> 37:06.256
Roxxxy, my dear,
this is not your time,

37:08.026 --> 37:13.363
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.247
I got to show
who I truly was.

37:14.248 --> 37:15.130
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.167
I will forever be thick
and juicy.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.202
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:19.204 --> 37:19.786
Bye-bye.

37:19.787 --> 37:20.369
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.555
(laughter and applause)

37:21.556 --> 37:22.739
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.442
- Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me

37:25.443 --> 37:28.144
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:28.146 --> 37:28.895
and prove to the world

37:28.896 --> 37:29.645
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.833
that you belong in
the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

37:32.834 --> 37:36.019
- I'm a little disappointed,
but I'm walking away so proud.

37:37.122 --> 37:41.658
The time has come
for you to lip sync

37:41.660 --> 37:44.261
(echoing) for your legacy.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.863
The time has come
for you to lip sync

37:46.865 --> 37:50.517
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

37:50.518 --> 37:54.170
The time has come
for you to lip sync

37:56.642 --> 37:59.809
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

37:59.811 --> 38:01.094
¶ And you were my man ¶

38:01.095 --> 38:02.378
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:02.381 --> 38:04.198
¶ You'd have
no other woman ¶

38:04.199 --> 38:06.016
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:06.018 --> 38:07.784
¶ You'd be weak as a lamb ¶

38:07.785 --> 38:09.551
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:09.554 --> 38:11.438
¶ If you had the strength ¶

38:11.439 --> 38:13.323
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:13.325 --> 38:14.708
¶ To walk out that door ¶

38:14.709 --> 38:16.092
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:16.094 --> 38:17.727
¶ My love
would overrule my sense ¶

38:17.728 --> 38:19.361
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:19.364 --> 38:20.480
¶ And I'd call you back
for more ¶

38:20.481 --> 38:21.597
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:21.600 --> 38:23.233
¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:23.234 --> 38:24.867
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:24.870 --> 38:26.370
¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:26.371 --> 38:27.871
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:27.873 --> 38:29.673
¶ And you were my man ¶

38:29.674 --> 38:31.474
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:31.476 --> 38:33.176
¶ Mm, baby ¶

38:33.177 --> 38:34.877
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:34.880 --> 38:35.362
- ¶ Girl ¶

38:35.363 --> 38:35.845
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:35.847 --> 38:36.963
- I should be America's
next drag superstar

38:36.964 --> 38:38.080
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:38.083 --> 38:39.066
because I'm the complex
female character.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.050
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:40.052 --> 38:41.818
I have the passion
do to something different

38:41.819 --> 38:43.585
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:43.588 --> 38:44.688
and disturbing
and challenging.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.789
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:45.791 --> 38:47.407
- ¶ When she lets you fall ¶

38:47.408 --> 38:49.024
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:49.027 --> 38:50.060
- I want to win "AllStars"

38:50.061 --> 38:51.094
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:51.096 --> 38:53.146
because I'm obsessed
with "RuPaul's Drag Race."

38:53.147 --> 38:55.197
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:55.200 --> 38:55.849
I can't think of anyone

38:55.850 --> 38:56.499
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:56.501 --> 38:57.734
who could possibly
have their picture

38:57.735 --> 38:58.968
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

38:58.970 --> 39:00.537
on that hall of fame
besides me.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.105
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:02.107 --> 39:02.989
- ¶ You're a part of me ¶

39:02.990 --> 39:03.872
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:03.875 --> 39:04.708
- I should be America's
next drag superstar

39:04.709 --> 39:05.542
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:05.544 --> 39:07.361
because I want to be
the queen of the weirdoes.

39:07.362 --> 39:09.179
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:09.181 --> 39:09.830
I know I joke about it
all the time

39:09.831 --> 39:10.480
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:10.482 --> 39:11.031
where I say
the crown is mine,

39:11.032 --> 39:11.581
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:11.583 --> 39:12.649
but I really feel
like it's fucking mine.

39:12.650 --> 39:13.716
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:13.719 --> 39:15.219
And I deserve it.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.720
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:16.722 --> 39:18.438
I want it so bad.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.155
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:20.158 --> 39:21.091
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:21.092 --> 39:22.025
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:22.027 --> 39:22.676
¶ If you were my woman ¶

39:22.677 --> 39:23.326
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:23.328 --> 39:24.995
- ¶ Here's what I'd do ¶

39:24.996 --> 39:26.663
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:26.665 --> 39:29.199
¶ Never, never, never
stop loving you ¶

39:29.200 --> 39:31.734
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:31.737 --> 39:33.120
- Wow.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.504
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:34.506 --> 39:36.323
(applause)

39:36.324 --> 39:38.141
- ¶ If I were your woman ¶

39:38.143 --> 39:41.561
- Ladies, the time has come
to crown our queen.

39:41.562 --> 39:44.980

39:46.418 --> 39:50.954
The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars,"

39:50.956 --> 39:52.472
the next queen
to be inducted

39:53.992 --> 39:56.743
into the Drag Race
Hall of Fame is...

39:56.744 --> 39:59.495
The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race AllStars,"

40:02.334 --> 40:03.233
Alaska.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.152
- ¶ You're a champion,
greatest of them all ¶

40:05.153 --> 40:07.070
Alaska.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.755
¶ You're a champion,
never gonna fall ¶

40:08.756 --> 40:10.439
Alaska.

40:10.442 --> 40:11.174
- (gasping)

40:11.175 --> 40:11.907
Alaska.

40:11.910 --> 40:12.642
- Con-drag-ulations.

40:12.643 --> 40:13.375
Alaska.

40:13.378 --> 40:14.561
You're a winner, baby.

40:14.562 --> 40:15.745
Alaska.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.696
- (sobbing)

40:16.697 --> 40:17.646
Alaska.

40:17.649 --> 40:18.448
- Here you are, darling.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.248
Alaska.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.401
On behalf of your millions
of fans around the world,

40:21.402 --> 40:23.552
Alaska.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.238
my queen, I bow to thee.

40:25.239 --> 40:26.922
Alaska.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.675
Now, is there anything
you'd like to say?

40:28.676 --> 40:30.426
Alaska.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.561
- Anus-thing is possible.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.694
Alaska.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.681
- Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

40:34.682 --> 40:36.666
Alaska.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.235
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

40:38.236 --> 40:39.803
Alaska.

40:39.805 --> 40:40.687
Can I get an amen
up in here?

40:40.688 --> 40:41.570
Alaska.

40:41.573 --> 40:41.938
- Amen!
- Amen!

40:41.939 --> 40:42.304

40:43.541 --> 40:44.774
Alaska.

40:44.776 --> 40:45.191
- Okay.
- Prance!

40:45.192 --> 40:45.607
Alaska.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.811
- ¶ You're a champion,
greatest of them all ¶

40:47.812 --> 40:50.013
Alaska.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.515
- I'm feeling so proud

40:51.516 --> 40:53.016
Alaska.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.885
and so honored
and so grateful.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.753
Alaska.

40:56.755 --> 40:57.521
I couldn't be more happy.

40:57.522 --> 40:58.288
Alaska.
