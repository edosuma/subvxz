WEBVTT

02:35.280 --> 02:36.202
Oh, no!

02:38.408 --> 02:39.659
What is happening here?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.956
Who is making that abominable noise?

02:41.957 --> 02:44.832
I'm sorry, Monsieur, we have struck a child, I believe.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.300
The child, Monsieur Le Marquis, is dead.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.215
The coach struck him. This man is the father.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.431
Really, it is extraordinary to me

02:56.432 --> 02:59.396
that you people cannot take care of yourselves.

02:59.397 --> 03:00.971
Or your children.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.189
Always in the way.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.607
How do I know what injury you may have done to my horses?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.031
Here. Give him that!

03:14.611 --> 03:15.954
Be brave, Gaspard.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.081
It is better for the poor little one to die so

03:18.082 --> 03:20.701
than to live in times such as these.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.253
He died quickly, without pain.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.806
Could he have lived an hour as happily.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.209
Oh, you're a philosopher, Monsieur?

03:28.917 --> 03:29.759
How do they call you?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.304
Defarge.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.464
Of what trade?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.184
A vendor of wine. That is my shop.

03:38.593 --> 03:44.849
Well, philosopher and vendor of wine, pick up that...

03:44.850 --> 03:47.694
And spend it as you will.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.741
Move on!

03:56.903 --> 03:58.075
Walk On.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.829
Ah-yuh!

04:08.290 --> 04:10.258
It was the best of times.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.878
It was the worst of times.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.428
It was the age of wisdom.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.260
It was the age of foolishness.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.476
It was the epoch of belief.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.975
It was the epoch of incredulity.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.599
It was the season of light.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.443
It was the season of darkness.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.739
It was the spring of hope.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.784
It was the winter of despair.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.205
Royal George, Dover...

04:45.619 --> 04:47.621
Royal George.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.630
Thank you, sir.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.444
Good morning to you, sir.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.772
I am Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.525
I'm looking for a young lady, Miss Lucie Manette.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.028
- Can you tell me where...?
- There, sir.

05:19.029 --> 05:19.869
I beg your pardon?

05:20.821 --> 05:21.987
There, sir.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.160
Directly behind you.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.284
Taking a tea with her companion.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.292
Miss Lucie?

05:33.834 --> 05:34.585
Mr. Lorry.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.924
Won't you sit down?

05:41.925 --> 05:42.883
Thank you.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.801
Um...

05:43.802 --> 05:44.927
You know Miss Pross, don't you?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.181
A pleasure, Ma'am. As always.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.027
What is this all about, Mr. Lorry?

05:57.315 --> 06:00.159
The letter said it was of the utmost importance.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.569
Quite true.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.200
Although, I must confess it's such
an astounding revelation that I...

06:05.201 --> 06:08.409
Indeed, I hardly know how to tell you.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.081
Is it something so dreadful?

06:10.082 --> 06:12.042
On the contrary, it's wonderful news.

06:12.043 --> 06:14.166
You were too young to remember, of course,

06:14.167 --> 06:16.792
your father being thrown into prison.

06:16.793 --> 06:21.014
At that time, any French nobleman
could imprison any French citizen

06:21.015 --> 06:23.475
with no questions asked.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.598
Does this concern my father's estate?

06:26.599 --> 06:28.438
No, not his estate.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.983
He left you enough to live comfortably,
as we both know...

06:31.984 --> 06:34.728
Oh, Miss Lucie...

06:35.145 --> 06:36.613
Courage, Mr. Lorry.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.944
Your father, my dear child...

06:38.945 --> 06:40.692
Your father has been found!

06:41.359 --> 06:42.234
What?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.278
Alive.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.203
He was left to die in prison. He did not die.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.412
Where is he?

06:48.783 --> 06:52.083
He's been taken to the house
of an old servant of his, in Paris.

06:52.084 --> 06:54.126
A man by the name of Defarge.

06:54.623 --> 06:58.171
It is in this house above a wine shop
that we can find him.

06:58.172 --> 07:01.763
Will you be able to leave with me
on the packet boat tomorrow?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.213
Oh, Miss Lucie.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.466
Oh, dear heavens. Look what you've done.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.890
Did you have to frighten the child to death?

07:07.891 --> 07:10.763
What sort of a banker are you?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.016
Fetch the vinegar!

07:22.108 --> 07:23.826
'Ere, watch out!

07:47.717 --> 07:48.759
Gaspard!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.012
What are you doing?

07:50.013 --> 07:51.637
Do you want to go to the mad hospital?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.060
Move on!

08:13.159 --> 08:14.994
The wine's outside.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.413
There was an accident.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.961
Did you hear me?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.711
They are here.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.762
Monsieur Lorry?

08:27.763 --> 08:28.757
Indeed.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.807
The lodging you wish to see is on the second floor,

08:31.808 --> 08:33.726
if you will come with me.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.583
Is he alone?

09:02.584 --> 09:03.625
Alone.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.594
God help them, sir. Who should be with him?

09:05.595 --> 09:07.004
Is the door locked?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.422
Always.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.345
Why?

09:09.507 --> 09:10.383
Why?

09:10.550 --> 09:12.769
Because he's lived so long locked up alone in prison

09:12.770 --> 09:18.359
that he would rave and tear himself
to pieces if this door were left open.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.614
Doctor?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.874
Good clay, Dr. Manette.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.159
Still hard at work, I see.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.704
Yes, I am working.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.709
May I let in a little more light, Doctor?

09:52.175 --> 09:53.926
Doctor?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.270
You have visitors.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.932
What?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.856
What is that?

10:02.143 --> 10:04.566
There is someone here to see you.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.115
Tell this gentleman what kind of shoes you make.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.401
Shoes?

10:11.402 --> 10:14.872
Can you describe the shoes for this gentleman?

10:16.407 --> 10:19.035
They are ladies' shoes.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.455
And the maker's name?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.708
Name?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.710
You ask my name?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.805
Yes.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.057
One hundred and five north tower.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.471
Sir?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.270
Do you not remember me?

11:09.836 --> 11:10.883
You.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.009
Yes.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.304
You are the jailer's daughter?

11:19.304 --> 11:20.226
No.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.916
Who are you?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.345
I don't...

12:01.346 --> 12:02.268
I don't...

12:03.556 --> 12:04.648
What?

12:20.448 --> 12:22.166
In the sun...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.746
it is the same.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.841
How can this be?

12:30.208 --> 12:34.509
It's so long ago when they came to take me away.

12:34.879 --> 12:40.300
We held each other... My little girl, she was in my arms.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.844
And when I arrived in prison,

12:42.845 --> 12:46.566
I found these on my sleeve, and I've...

12:46.724 --> 12:50.103
I've... kept them ever since.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.443
How is this?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.900
Was it you?

12:56.901 --> 12:57.618
Oh, please.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.790
It cannot be.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.118
We've come to take you away with us.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.370
We've come to help you.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.789
Please trust us, my dear.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.258
Please trust me.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.386
Oh, my dear, please trust me.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.424
Thank God I have found you...

13:20.425 --> 13:23.725
I have found you again.

13:33.896 --> 13:34.688
My tools.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.689
What?

13:35.690 --> 13:36.606
What's that?

13:36.607 --> 13:38.153
He wants his tools to make the shoes.

13:38.154 --> 13:39.528
- Ah...
- One moment, Doctor.

13:39.529 --> 13:41.621
I shall be right back.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.036
Shall we, Doctor?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.713
What is that?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.673
Some writings of his.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.008
A diary, perhaps-

14:03.009 --> 14:04.209
I'll put it in with his tools.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.691
Give it to me.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.647
We shall keep it here.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.269
Why?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.568
To read, you fool.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.066
Godspeed.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.115
To the barrier!

14:49.514 --> 14:53.683
Excuse me, Monseigneur,
but your nephew is here to see you.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.061
Well, what do you want?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.655
Be quick about it. I'm busy.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.484
I'm here to say good-bye.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.653
I'm leaving France.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.613
For how long?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.572
Forever.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.120
Monseigneur!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.332
Where are your dogs?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.708
Dogs?

15:18.709 --> 15:20.961
You're shooting pigeon. Who fetches them?

15:20.962 --> 15:26.935
Oh, yes, well, I really don't care much for pigeon.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.187
I would be hard-pressed
to think of anything in this world

15:30.188 --> 15:31.680
you do care for.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.350
- Except yourself.
- Yes, perhaps.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.149
Really, that's quite true.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.068
It is no wonder the family is looked on with nothing

15:40.069 --> 15:41.862
but thoughts of fear and slavery.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.026
That I take to be a compliment.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.279
Get away! Get away!

15:47.697 --> 15:49.540
Let me tell you, my dear nephew...

15:49.541 --> 15:54.619
Fear and slavery keep the scum obedient.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.706
As long as the roof shuts out the sky.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.459
That may not be as long as you would suppose.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.671
The tide is turning. There's a new philosophy in the air.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.592
The people are going to rise up in righteous vengeance.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.346
Well, I shall continue to uphold the honor of our family,

16:11.347 --> 16:12.642
even if you will not.

16:12.643 --> 16:16.484
Honor? You can speak of honor?

16:17.226 --> 16:19.775
Sir, we have done wrong,

16:19.937 --> 16:21.937
and we are about to reap the fruits of that wrong.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.900
Never.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.069
In any case, I shan't be here to see it.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.825
France is your natural destiny.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.789
Accept it or be lost.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.704
I regret to say that France is already lost to me now.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.999
A wilderness of misery and ruin.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.219
I'm going to live elsewhere.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.712
By what means?

16:45.713 --> 16:48.131
By my own labor.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.009
Really?

16:50.218 --> 16:51.343
Where?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.220
England.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.142
I daresay if I stay here any longer,

16:55.143 --> 16:57.858
you might contrive to have me put in prison.

16:57.859 --> 17:01.070
Indeed. Would that I still had the power.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.523
Good-bye, Monseigneur.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.367
I hope never to see you again.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.167
Be careful, Charles.

17:16.868 --> 17:21.089
They're not fond of spies in England, you know.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.099
Monsieur...

17:40.434 --> 17:41.726
Monsieur.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.146
I beg you, take me with you to England.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.694
I can't work here any longer, with him.

17:47.695 --> 17:49.738
And if the people rise up against the family...

17:49.739 --> 17:52.737
My clear Gabelle, you're perfectly safe here.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.489
You're a servant, not a member of the family.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.618
But I've served the family for so long.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.249
Indeed, you have, my good friend.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.955
For as long as I can remember.

18:01.956 --> 18:05.802
But, you see, I'm no longer
in any position to keep a servant.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.089
I must try to make a living for myself.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.016
I am sorry, Gabelle.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.477
But you have my promise...

18:15.478 --> 18:19.565
My sacred promise, that no harm will ever come to you.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.860
Good-bye, my good friend.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.906
It's just a few steps, Father.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.700
There's a packet boat waiting.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.197
I feel so tired.

19:17.198 --> 19:17.915
Mr. Lorry!

19:18.449 --> 19:20.372
Miss Pross!

19:27.667 --> 19:28.964
May I be of any help?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.878
Monsieur, thank you.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.759
My father, he's been very ill, and he...

19:36.425 --> 19:39.224
Come. Allow me, please.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.306
Ah, there you are.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.850
I've taken Miss Pross safely aboard.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.024
Mr. Lorry, I'd like to introduce...

19:48.025 --> 19:49.646
Darnay. Charles Darnay.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.647
Your servant, sir.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.363
If I can be of any further assistance,
please call upon me.

19:53.364 --> 19:54.859
- Oh...
- Here, let me take him.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.985
You're so kind, Monsieur. Thank you.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.408
Come along, Doctor.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.783
Come on, you can trust me.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.619
Turn around. That's it.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.205
Right, one foot up.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.541
Yes, that's it.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.590
One step at a time.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.295
Very good, Doctor, yes.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.507
Mr. Darnay, you're so very kind. Thank you.

20:17.508 --> 20:20.478
If I can be of any further assist...

20:24.348 --> 20:25.440
Good evening.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.087
All ashore, please!

20:54.712 --> 20:58.057
With these papers, I relinquish all of my property

20:58.058 --> 21:00.675
and my titles here in France.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.725
We shall see that they are delivered
to the proper authorities, Monsieur.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.265
Godspeed, and a safe journey.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.066
Avoir, Monsieur.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.852
Come.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.336
Here we are, sir.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.637
Thank you, Jerry.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.099
I'm not looking forward to this. It's a sad business.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.345
It is, sir.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.554
Mmh...

21:46.555 --> 21:48.394
- All right?
- All set now, sir.

21:48.395 --> 21:50.061
- Thank you.
- Got the carriage outside.

21:50.062 --> 21:51.902
- All right, thank you.
- Right, sir.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.363
What's going on, Jerry? Where are you off to?

21:57.364 --> 21:58.608
The Old Bailey.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.610
Trial for treason... You know what that means, don't you?

22:00.611 --> 22:01.988
They'll hang him up, slice him down,

22:01.989 --> 22:03.738
burn up his insides and chop off his head.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.787
You mean, if they find him guilty.

22:05.788 --> 22:10.459
Oh, they will. They always find 'em guilty.

22:36.522 --> 22:41.109
The prisoner is charged with being
a traitor to our Lord the King,

22:41.110 --> 22:44.533
by reason of his having assisted the French King Louis

22:44.534 --> 22:47.079
in his wars against England in North America.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.579
He has thus indirectly aided the American General,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.372
George Washington,

22:54.373 --> 22:57.718
in his hopeless struggle against our noble countrymen.

22:58.961 --> 23:06.175
Your Lordship, I will prove to this court
that this man, Charles Darnay,

23:06.176 --> 23:08.554
is a contemptible spy!

23:09.972 --> 23:15.768
The prisoner has been passing
and Repassing from France to England

23:15.769 --> 23:20.866
on secret business of which he can give no good account.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.737
Sydney!

23:25.738 --> 23:27.581
Good God, man, there's a trial going on here!

23:27.582 --> 23:29.917
- Get hold of yourself!
- Late night.

23:29.918 --> 23:31.161
Sorry.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.958
I have witnesses in this courtroom today

23:37.875 --> 23:42.847
who saw the prisoner on a trip
from France nine months ago.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.300
It is my information that they saw the prisoner confer

23:47.301 --> 23:52.728
with fellow conspirators on a packet out of Le Havre.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.568
I propose to call one of these witnesses at this time.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.062
Dr. Manette.

24:14.495 --> 24:15.703
Dr. Manette.

24:15.704 --> 24:19.752
Can you identify the prisoner as your
fellow traveler, returning from France?

24:19.753 --> 24:23.755
Unfortunately, I was recovering
from a long illness at the time.

24:23.756 --> 24:26.303
My mind was a blank, you see, for a long period.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.843
And I can only thank a gracious God now

24:28.844 --> 24:30.685
for restoring my faculties once again.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.938
Once again, can you identify the prisoner?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.598
No.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.600
Were you traveling alone?

24:37.476 --> 24:40.776
I was accompanied by Mr. Jarvis Lorry and my daughter.

24:41.522 --> 24:45.572
Thank you. I now call Miss Lucie Manette.

24:51.699 --> 24:52.996
Oh, my!

24:54.326 --> 24:58.047
What a beauty we have here.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.545
You have looked upon the prisoner.

25:01.875 --> 25:02.792
Yes.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.670
Speak up, please.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.587
I have.

25:06.588 --> 25:12.301
Did you not see this man confer
with two other men aboard the packet

25:12.302 --> 25:14.887
when you returned from France?

25:14.888 --> 25:15.805
I...

25:15.806 --> 25:17.979
Speak up, please. We cannot hear you.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.487
Yes, I saw him.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.866
And were there not papers passed
between these men that night?

25:27.860 --> 25:32.957
I saw papers. I could not hear what was said.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.577
- Mr. Darnay told...
- The prisoner...

25:37.578 --> 25:40.798
The prisoner... Yes.

25:44.418 --> 25:49.299
He was very kind to me
and to my father, very considerate.

25:52.051 --> 25:57.307
I do hope that nothing I say here today
will repay him by doing him any harm.

25:57.308 --> 26:00.146
Now, you may not wish to testify
against the prisoner, Miss Manette,

26:00.147 --> 26:03.362
but be that as it may, is this the man you saw?

26:05.731 --> 26:06.778
Speak up!

26:08.192 --> 26:09.150
Yes.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.243
Thank you very much.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.540
I will now call upon Mr. John Barsad.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.350
I saw the prisoner with my own eyes.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.433
I watched him as he passed on secret information

26:36.434 --> 26:40.558
to the two French gentlemen on three different occasions.

26:40.891 --> 26:44.439
You are absolutely certain that it was
the prisoner here, Charles Darnay,

26:44.440 --> 26:48.278
who passed on this vital and important
government information

26:48.279 --> 26:51.573
about our military strength to these... these spies?

26:52.402 --> 26:53.403
I am, sir.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.659
Would you, sir, be so very kind as to
amplify your public-spirited gesture

26:57.660 --> 27:03.746
even further by telling the court
in more detail about the events

27:03.747 --> 27:05.086
which surrounded the passing

27:05.087 --> 27:08.632
of this vitally important government
information that he...?

27:08.633 --> 27:11.176
Yes, sir, I'd be delighted.

27:11.713 --> 27:15.216
It was during the month of February,
when I had occasion to travel...

27:15.217 --> 27:18.016
Well, what do you have, my wicked fellow?

27:18.017 --> 27:21.389
I'll have two crown, if you don't mind please.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.361
But, of course, the money first, always.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.238
He works for the French, him.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.276
He's a paid informer.

27:33.277 --> 27:37.407
Real name "Guillermin".

27:39.116 --> 27:43.452
Spies for the French everywhere, nasty reputation.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.956
Just mention his real name, that's all.

27:46.957 --> 27:50.712
You do that, and he'll suddenly forget
what he's here for.

27:50.713 --> 27:52.008
Who paid him this time?

27:52.009 --> 27:53.254
Who knows?

27:53.255 --> 27:56.054
Someone in France, doesn't matter.

27:56.383 --> 28:01.685
You want him to shut up, mention his real name.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.518
Then the papers were passed between them,

28:05.519 --> 28:08.396
the two Frenchmen disembarked,
and the prisoner went to his cabin,

28:08.397 --> 28:11.069
where he stayed for the rest of the journey.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.945
I thank you for your testimony, sir,
and I wish to commend you now,

28:15.946 --> 28:19.322
in this courtroom, for the noble and patriotic duty

28:19.323 --> 28:22.452
of coming forward to identify this traitor.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.121
Allowed the defense will question the witness?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.089
You may proceed.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.714
What do you live upon, sir?

28:33.420 --> 28:34.296
Property.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.177
What property?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.352
I can't precisely remember where.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.806
This information that you say you saw passed on...

28:45.807 --> 28:47.229
Did you actually read it?

28:47.230 --> 28:50.070
Yes, sir, but I didn't study on it.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.026
Marked secret, you know.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.110
How much did you receive to give this evidence today?

28:57.152 --> 28:59.028
Nothing.

28:59.029 --> 29:02.406
Nothing at all to lay a trap for this prisoner?

29:02.407 --> 29:03.616
No.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.119
You swear to that?

29:07.037 --> 29:08.630
I do.

29:10.791 --> 29:14.591
M'lord, I have no further questions for this witness.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.720
Sir, just one moment, M'lord, if I may?

29:26.348 --> 29:28.225
If I may, sir?

29:29.559 --> 29:31.232
I do have just one more question.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.489
You tell this court that you're absolutely certain

29:39.490 --> 29:41.488
in your identification of this prisoner.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.204
Yes, sir.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.832
Have you ever seen anyone who looked like the prisoner?

29:50.122 --> 29:51.840
Not so much as I'd be mistaken.

29:52.165 --> 29:58.423
I ask you then to look upon my learned
colleague here, Mr. Sydney Carton.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.222
Would you stand next to the prisoner?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.614
Would you lay aside your wig, sir?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.838
Are they not very much like each other?

30:33.123 --> 30:35.626
Look closely, sir.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.553
Well, yes, there's a certain similarity.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.181
But I'm not mistaken.

30:46.094 --> 30:50.099
The man I saw on the wharf
was the prisoner, Charles Darnay.

30:51.308 --> 30:55.688
I should like to probe your memory
a little further, Mr. Guillermin.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.230
Yes.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.447
Would you like a closer look perhaps, Mr. Guillermin?

31:01.448 --> 31:03.444
The name of the witness is Barsad.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.030
Oh, yes, yes, of course, forgive me.

31:06.031 --> 31:06.953
Speak up, sir!

31:07.449 --> 31:11.420
Do you remain certain in your identification?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.375
No.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.293
Louder, please, sir.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.138
I don't believe the court heard your answer.

31:28.136 --> 31:28.978
No.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.513
No!

31:30.514 --> 31:35.645
You can no longer identify the prisoner
as the man you saw, correct?

31:36.061 --> 31:40.157
It could have been someone else, correct?

31:40.690 --> 31:42.988
- Correct.
- Thank you, sir.

31:44.236 --> 31:49.333
I have not further questions of this patriotic witness.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.965
I don't understand what happened to him.

31:56.966 --> 32:02.214
What happens to all men when their
past catches up to their present.

32:02.504 --> 32:03.505
M'lord.

32:03.797 --> 32:06.969
The jury desires, with your lordship's permission,

32:06.970 --> 32:09.470
to retire and deliberate the verdict.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.020
You may proceed.

32:24.651 --> 32:30.072
If I may inquire Mr. Lorry, the young
lady seemed quite distressed.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.036
How is she faring now?

32:31.037 --> 32:32.625
She's recovering, thank you.

32:32.626 --> 32:34.243
I'll tell the prisoner.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.995
He seemed to be quite concerned for her...

32:35.996 --> 32:38.670
Or perhaps you might tell him yourself.

32:38.671 --> 32:39.874
Well, I...

32:39.875 --> 32:44.096
Oh, well, of course, a respectable
bank gentleman, such as you...

32:44.097 --> 32:49.344
It wouldn't do to be speaking
to the prisoner in public, would it?

33:13.450 --> 33:14.690
Has the jury reached a verdict?

33:16.077 --> 33:18.204
We have, M'lord.

33:18.205 --> 33:23.257
We find the prisoner, Charles Darnay,
innocent of all charges.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.050
Well, Mr. Darnay, I'm happy to have
brought you off with honor.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.507
Indeed, sir.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.475
You have saved my life.

34:12.801 --> 34:13.801
Thank you, sir.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.761
I did my best.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.436
My congratulations, sir, upon your vindication.

34:18.437 --> 34:21.559
And you have my regret, good Doctor,

34:21.560 --> 34:26.987
that I brought you and your lovely daughter into this.

34:28.858 --> 34:29.984
Thank you, Doctor.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.531
Well, come along, my dear.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.001
Good fortune to you, sir.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.504
So, Mr. Lorry.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.835
It seems that men of business
may now speak to Mr. Darnay.

34:44.835 --> 34:47.585
Men of business are not their own master, sir.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.257
We must think of the house we serve more than ourselves.

34:50.259 --> 34:51.507
Don't be nettled, Mr. Lorry.

34:51.507 --> 34:54.257
I am certainly not nettled!

34:54.259 --> 34:57.636
And I am not certain what you have to
do with this matter at all!

34:57.637 --> 34:58.934
As far as I can see, it's none of your business!

34:59.097 --> 34:59.939
Quite right.

35:00.098 --> 35:00.894
I have no business.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.147
It's a pity you haven't, sir,

35:02.148 --> 35:04.190
because if you had, you might leave us and attend to it!

35:04.191 --> 35:05.524
God love you, sir, no I...

35:05.525 --> 35:07.146
Then, perhaps you might realize

35:07.147 --> 35:09.696
that business is a good and respectable thing.

35:12.319 --> 35:15.992
Mr. Darnay, I hope you've been
preserved for a prosperous life.

35:15.993 --> 35:16.956
Good day to you, sir.

35:16.957 --> 35:17.865
Good day.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.459
Well, if you excuse me, gentlemen...

35:20.535 --> 35:22.913
I have work to do.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.839
It's a strange chance, wouldn't you say?

35:30.337 --> 35:31.509
I beg your pardon.

35:31.510 --> 35:32.926
That you and I...

35:33.089 --> 35:34.966
Two lookalikes...

35:35.133 --> 35:37.682
should be thrown together on such an occasion.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.940
Frankly, I don't see all that much resemblance, but...

35:42.098 --> 35:44.692
I hardly feel part of this world again, as yet.

35:44.976 --> 35:45.893
Yes.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.269
It's just a few moments ago

35:47.270 --> 35:49.551
that you were pretty far advanced on your way to another.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.607
Come.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.406
Let me show you to the nearest tavern.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.779
Oh, do come along, Mr. Darnay.

35:56.780 --> 35:59.370
I've done nothing but dream of a good wine

35:59.371 --> 36:01.585
while these numbskulls were deliberating

36:01.586 --> 36:03.999
which world you should belong to.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.397
Drink up, Darnay.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.315
Drink!

36:32.941 --> 36:36.036
You may be grateful to be among us again,

36:36.236 --> 36:40.537
but as for myself, I wish only to forget this world.

36:40.699 --> 36:45.830
It has no good in it for me, except perhaps this wine.

36:47.163 --> 36:51.293
A toast. Let us have a toast.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.178
What toast would you have?

36:55.004 --> 36:57.974
Wait, wait, it's on the tip of my tongue.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.802
It ought to be... It must be...

37:00.969 --> 37:02.687
I swear it's there.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.640
To Miss Manette.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.643
Ah-ha-ha!

37:08.810 --> 37:11.313
To Miss Manette.

37:16.484 --> 37:21.285
There's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.200
Yes.

37:24.868 --> 37:29.374
Tell me, how does it feel to be pitied by and wept for

37:29.539 --> 37:30.998
by such an angel?

37:30.999 --> 37:34.344
Is it worth being tried for one's life?

37:34.502 --> 37:36.550
Is it, Darnay?

37:37.297 --> 37:39.425
Yes, I daresay it is.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.595
I would even suggest that an angel such as this

37:42.761 --> 37:46.641
is worth giving up a life of dissipation for.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.851
Oh, dear, did I say that?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.811
Well, I mean it, yes.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.861
For this particular angel. Oh, yes.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.620
Another question.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.824
The truth, sir.

38:03.990 --> 38:07.494
Do you think I particularly like you?

38:07.660 --> 38:10.539
Really, Mr. Carton, I have not
asked myself that question.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.128
Ask it now.

38:15.919 --> 38:19.799
You have acted as if you do, but I doubt that you do.

38:21.633 --> 38:25.934
Indeed, I doubt it, too.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.267
But I begin to understand you.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.691
Nevertheless, I want you to know how grateful I am

38:33.853 --> 38:36.902
for all that you and Mr. Stryver have done for me.

38:36.903 --> 38:40.619
Good. Let's have a drink to that.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.451
You'll forgive my saying so, Mr. Carton,

38:43.613 --> 38:45.615
but I think you have been drinking too much.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.034
You think, sir?

38:47.200 --> 38:49.077
You know, sir.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.539
I always drink too much.

38:52.705 --> 38:56.710
In fact, I do nothing in moderation except work. Correct?

38:56.876 --> 38:58.344
If you say so, Mr. Carton.

38:59.671 --> 39:04.518
Then, you shall also know
that I am a disappointed drudge, sir.

39:05.385 --> 39:10.061
I care for no man on earth, and no man cares for me.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.979
That is much to be regretted.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.067
You might have used your talents better.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.576
Maybe so, Mr. Darnay.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.741
But don't be too confident.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.202
You never know what it may come to.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.703
I bid you good night, sir.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.766
Miss Pross! Miss Pross, hurry!

39:55.351 --> 39:57.695
Come in. Come in, please.

39:57.854 --> 40:00.198
Lucie will be here in a moment.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.026
I understand that you are doing quite well now

40:03.192 --> 40:05.911
as a tutor of the French language.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.664
Yes. I've been most fortunate in that respect,

40:08.823 --> 40:11.622
and I expect to have a post soon at the university.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.168
What a lovely day, Mr. Darnay.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.125
I'm so looking forward to our drive in the country.

40:18.291 --> 40:22.546
- No more than I.
- And I.

40:23.296 --> 40:26.345
Yes, indeed, Miss Pross. What would I do without you?

40:26.507 --> 40:28.601
You shan't, I promise you.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.647
Enjoy yourselves.

41:23.439 --> 41:25.316
We're going for a stroll, Miss Pross.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.950
May I ask you, sir, to remain where I can see you?

41:29.112 --> 41:31.615
Of course, Miss Pross.

43:11.214 --> 43:13.342
Good evening, Monseigneur.

43:14.634 --> 43:16.887
- You think I'm drunk, don't you?
- No, Monseigneur.

43:17.053 --> 43:20.023
Ah, let go of me.

43:27.563 --> 43:31.363
Take your hands off me!

46:03.344 --> 46:05.472
Why, Mr. Carton.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.106
Do come in.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.075
What a pleasant surprise.

46:23.531 --> 46:26.876
I just stopped by for a moment to inquire of...

46:27.034 --> 46:30.914
That is to say, I've been invited
to a regatta in Devon on Friday,

46:31.080 --> 46:33.378
and I was wondering... hoping...

46:33.541 --> 46:35.885
perhaps you might be able to join me?

46:36.043 --> 46:37.841
Oh, dear.

46:38.963 --> 46:41.307
I'm sorry, Mr. Carton,

46:41.465 --> 46:45.515
but I promised Father that I would go
with him to Hastings on Friday.

46:45.678 --> 46:48.179
A medical conference.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.432
Oh, I see.

46:52.852 --> 46:54.354
Well, perhaps some other time, then.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.614
I'm sorry.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.359
Won't you have some tea?

46:58.360 --> 47:00.075
No, no, thank you. I'd best be moving on.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.578
A glass of sherry, perhaps?

47:03.112 --> 47:05.740
No, thank you.

47:05.906 --> 47:08.455
My warmest regards to your father.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.468
Sir, I do not doubt your loving Lucie.

47:25.634 --> 47:28.137
You may be satisfied on it.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.481
Have you spoken to her?

47:30.639 --> 47:33.313
- No.
- Why?

47:33.476 --> 47:36.150
In deference to her father?

47:40.024 --> 47:42.823
I have seen you, Doctor.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.987
I have watched the two of you together.

47:45.154 --> 47:50.832
I have seen an affection so unique,
so touching, that I...

47:53.037 --> 47:56.132
That is why I hesitate.

47:56.290 --> 47:58.543
She is devoted to you with all of her heart.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.170
You were lost to her,

48:01.337 --> 48:04.056
and your return has brought her nothing but happiness.

48:04.673 --> 48:09.053
How can I, then, bring my love between you?

48:11.138 --> 48:13.186
- And yet...
- Yes?

48:13.349 --> 48:15.852
I beg you to believe

48:16.018 --> 48:19.354
that I would never put a separation between you.

48:19.355 --> 48:25.704
I look only to loving your daughter,
and serving both of you,

48:25.903 --> 48:27.746
to the death.

48:28.447 --> 48:32.827
You speak so feelingly
that I thank you with all my heart.

48:33.953 --> 48:36.752
Do you have reason to believe that Lucy loves you?

48:37.706 --> 48:38.707
I think it possible,

48:38.874 --> 48:42.299
but without your permission, I could have no hope at all.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.088
Well, there is no question.

48:44.255 --> 48:48.226
She is everything to me, far more than life itself.

48:49.385 --> 48:51.387
And knowing you, sir...

48:52.096 --> 48:54.940
I'm delighted to say that you have my consent.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.726
I thank you.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.193
But in truth...

49:01.939 --> 49:04.863
You don't know me. Not really.

49:06.610 --> 49:10.615
You see, my present name is not as my own.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.911
- I came here to England because...
- No.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.247
I wish only to better deserve your confidence.

49:17.413 --> 49:19.711
No.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.592
- Later.
- Sir.

49:21.750 --> 49:24.128
You may tell me when I ask it of you.

49:25.004 --> 49:28.131
If Lucie should give her consent,

49:28.132 --> 49:30.100
then, you may tell me on your wedding clay.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.346
As you wish.

49:34.597 --> 49:38.318
May your hopes, then, find success.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.570
Thank you.

49:40.728 --> 49:41.900
Thank you, sir.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.359
Are you going to work on the Harrison case?

49:46.525 --> 49:48.948
It doesn't interest me.

49:49.111 --> 49:52.957
We're not paid to express our interest, Sydney.

49:53.115 --> 49:54.824
- Stryver.
- Hm.

49:54.825 --> 49:56.168
Have a drink.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.672
A drink at this hour? Are you serious?

49:59.830 --> 50:02.083
Now, look, Sydney,

50:02.249 --> 50:04.377
I must tell you to your face that you concern me.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.466
- I worry about you.
- Thank you.

50:06.629 --> 50:09.132
You're certain to end up
without position in a debtor's prison.

50:09.298 --> 50:10.220
I quite agree.

50:10.382 --> 50:13.181
You've spent all of your money on simple pursuits.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.729
Exactly.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.142
You know, Sydney,

50:20.309 --> 50:23.859
you really should consider
putting an end to this dissolution.

50:24.605 --> 50:25.822
- Any suggestions?
- Hm.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.024
How?

50:27.191 --> 50:28.693
Marriage.

50:29.568 --> 50:30.693
Marriage?

50:30.694 --> 50:32.784
Look the situation in the eye, Sydney.

50:32.785 --> 50:35.124
It would be very beneficial for you.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.660
A man in your profession at the bar, to have a wife.

50:38.619 --> 50:40.292
Am I not mistaken...

50:40.454 --> 50:42.206
Are you not unmarried yourself?

50:44.083 --> 50:46.836
- Oh, I intend to get married.
- When?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.127
Very shortly.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.846
Congratulations.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.596
And may I ask the name of this most fortunate lady?

50:52.758 --> 50:54.681
Well...

50:54.843 --> 50:56.971
I hope this revelation won't make you uncomfortable,

50:57.137 --> 50:59.560
but I speak of Miss Lucie Manette.

51:00.683 --> 51:02.651
Now, I know you visited her on occasion,

51:02.810 --> 51:05.609
and we both know she has no great fortune.

51:05.771 --> 51:08.650
So, she's a... She's a charming creature.

51:08.816 --> 51:10.614
And I've made up my mind to please myself.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.489
She will have in me a man already quite well off,

51:14.655 --> 51:18.501
and a rapidly rising man of some distinction.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.779
Yes, it will be a very good piece of fortune for her.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.419
But then, she is worthy of fortune.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.717
What's the matter?

51:31.046 --> 51:33.720
Now, look here, I find your reaction most annoying.

51:33.882 --> 51:35.850
Stop it!

51:36.051 --> 51:37.348
Sorry.

51:38.721 --> 51:40.394
You'll see.

51:40.556 --> 51:42.399
You'll see.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.797
Absolutely.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.307
The situation in France gets worse every day.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.434
Or better, as the case may be.

52:17.593 --> 52:20.142
Better? Are you serious, sir?

52:20.304 --> 52:23.774
I think that France has been ruled too long by tyrants.

52:23.932 --> 52:26.560
Perhaps, something better will come out of this turmoil.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.729
I must say, I very much doubt it.

52:28.896 --> 52:30.898
You don't have a drink, Mr. Carton.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.575
Oh, no, thank you, I don't care for one.

52:33.734 --> 52:36.906
They tell me there's going to be an afternoon of cricket

52:36.907 --> 52:38.531
in Hyde Park on Saturday.

52:38.697 --> 52:41.917
I was wondering if perhaps
you might be free on this occasion?

52:43.369 --> 52:46.794
Mr. Carton, I don't know what to say.

52:48.374 --> 52:51.799
You're so kind and so thoughtful.

52:51.960 --> 52:55.214
But to tell you the truth, I'm not at liberty.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.513
- I see.
- No, I'm afraid you don't.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.895
Actually, it's something more than that.

53:01.053 --> 53:02.976
It's that...

53:03.180 --> 53:06.354
Well, you shall know very shortly, I promise.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.770
Before the evening is over.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.941
There we are. One more glass of champagne.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.525
Who doesn't have a glass?

53:14.692 --> 53:16.410
I think Mr. Carton.

53:16.568 --> 53:17.860
No, thank you.

53:17.861 --> 53:22.241
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear fellow,
but I'm afraid you cannot refuse.

53:25.994 --> 53:27.496
I have an announcement to make,

53:27.663 --> 53:31.088
and I would like everybody to listen very carefully.

53:31.250 --> 53:34.971
I wish to announce the engagement
of my beloved daughter Lucie

53:35.170 --> 53:36.968
to this wonderful young man.

53:37.172 --> 53:39.516
How marvelous! My congratulations, sir.

53:39.675 --> 53:43.805
A toast, if you will, to a long and happy life together.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.598
To a long and happy life together.

53:45.764 --> 53:47.641
A long a happy life.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.824
I simply can't believe it. I can't.

53:58.986 --> 54:03.162
That charming creature married to him.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.919
Don't you agree, Sydney?

54:08.704 --> 54:11.127
It isn't as though that Darnay
fellow's a man of business.

54:11.290 --> 54:15.420
There's no comparison between
his position in life and mine.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.304
None whatsoever.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.056
Do you hear me, Sydney?

54:21.759 --> 54:24.228
Damned difficult to understand.

54:25.053 --> 54:29.684
Yes, perhaps I should have made
my intentions known sooner.

54:29.850 --> 54:33.775
Yes, that must be it. I delayed too long.

54:33.937 --> 54:38.408
Still, to throw herself away on that... French tutor.

54:38.901 --> 54:41.948
Oh, well, women have committed similar follies before

54:41.949 --> 54:43.663
and have repented in poverty.

54:43.822 --> 54:45.495
It's just as well, I suppose.

54:45.657 --> 54:48.786
I should have gained nothing by such a liaison.

54:48.952 --> 54:51.125
- Careful.
- Huh?

54:52.748 --> 54:53.499
Hmm?

54:53.665 --> 54:57.465
Be careful of how you speak of Miss Manette.

54:59.671 --> 55:02.299
Do you understand me?

55:22.736 --> 55:26.240
Prisoner and escort, halt!

55:29.034 --> 55:30.201
Move!

55:30.202 --> 55:32.625
Escort, at ease!

55:44.550 --> 55:46.052
Who did he kill?

55:46.218 --> 55:48.346
The Marquis St. Evremonde.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.264
An excellent choice.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.183
The Marquis killed his son.
He ran over him in the street.

55:53.392 --> 55:56.521
I would not require such a reason.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.985
The House of Evremonde,

55:59.147 --> 56:01.696
they are recorded, all of them.

56:01.859 --> 56:06.070
They are recorded, here, in my stitches,

56:06.071 --> 56:08.119
as plain to me as the sun.

56:20.460 --> 56:23.805
Escort -- forward, march!

56:26.508 --> 56:30.103
Well, it is over.

56:30.262 --> 56:33.015
And worth the price.

56:57.331 --> 57:00.380
Have the goodness to give me
a glass of old cognac, Madame.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.166
You knit with great skill, Madame.

57:37.329 --> 57:39.673
I am accustomed to it.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.959
May I ask what it is for?

57:43.001 --> 57:45.299
A shroud.

57:45.504 --> 57:46.756
Pardon?

57:48.674 --> 57:50.847
It is only a pastime.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.636
Not for use.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.396
One day...

57:54.554 --> 57:58.604
I may find a use for it... one day.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.522
Did you see the hanging today, Madame?

58:02.688 --> 58:05.191
- A bad business.
- Why?

58:05.357 --> 58:07.451
If people kill other people with knives,

58:07.609 --> 58:09.198
they deserve to pay the price.

58:09.199 --> 58:11.947
But surely you must feel some sympathy for him?

58:14.616 --> 58:16.038
My husband.

58:16.201 --> 58:17.748
Oh, good day, Monsieur.

58:17.911 --> 58:22.257
I was just talking about the unhappy
fate of poor Monsieur Gaspard.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.510
I know nothing of it.

58:25.127 --> 58:27.545
You are Monsieur DeFarge?

58:27.546 --> 58:29.139
I am.

58:29.923 --> 58:33.427
I have the honor of sharing
a mutual friend with you, Monsieur.

58:33.593 --> 58:37.439
Dr. Manette, yes?

58:39.307 --> 58:40.934
When he was released from prison,

58:41.101 --> 58:44.230
I understand that you had charge of him.

58:44.396 --> 58:46.319
Such is the fact.

58:47.107 --> 58:49.075
His daughter came to you here.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.328
Such is the fact.

58:53.071 --> 58:54.948
Have you heard about them recently?

58:55.115 --> 58:56.537
We have not, sir.

58:56.700 --> 58:59.415
- She's going to be married.
- Excellent.

58:59.416 --> 59:01.960
She should have been married years ago.

59:01.961 --> 59:07.007
The English are cold, it seems to me.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.592
It's a curious thing, she's going
to be married to the nephew

59:09.755 --> 59:12.099
of the Marquis St. Evremonde.

59:12.674 --> 59:15.553
You know, the man who was killed by poor Gaspard.

59:17.512 --> 59:20.391
He's called Charles Darnay,

59:20.599 --> 59:23.227
but he's an Evremonde, make no mistake.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.648
Well...

59:29.357 --> 59:31.701
Thank you for the cognac.

59:32.652 --> 59:34.325
Good evening.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.259
- Who is he?
- How should I know?

59:47.417 --> 59:51.138
Barsad. The name is Barsad.

59:51.296 --> 59:53.799
He's a new spy commissioned to the district.

59:53.965 --> 59:54.807
Register his name.

59:54.966 --> 59:57.014
- Two names.
- Two?

59:57.177 --> 59:59.887
The spy Barsad,

59:59.888 --> 01:00:04.234
and the nephew of St. Evremond, Charles Darnay.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:05.769
It is strange.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.904
After all the sympathy we showed for her father

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:11.567
that she should marry such a despicable dog.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:14.907
For her sake, he'd better stay out of France.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:18.449
His destiny will take him where he has to go,

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:21.251
and we shall be waiting.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.711
Only a moment, gentlemen.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.626
Well, if they don't hurry,
we shall have to delay the wedding.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.717
One more moment.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.722
And so, it became necessary

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.760
to renounce everything I once held dear.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:41.055
My property, my country,

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.972
Even my name.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.317
Your name?

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.854
I tried to tell you long before this.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.614
I wanted to forget my past.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.990
Now, I feel it's only fair to tell you that...

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.781
My name is St. Evremonde.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.783
Charles St. Evremonde...

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:07.298
A name that I detest
for all that it stands for in France.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:11.753
Excuse me, it's getting very late if we are to...

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:15.764
Fetch the carriage, Miss Pross. We're coming at once.

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:28.272
- I, Lucie.
- Take thee, Charles.

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.439
- Take thee, Charles.
- To my wedded husband.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.273
- To my wedded husband.
- To have and to hold.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.073
- To have and to hold.
- From this day forward.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.487
From this day forward.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.744
- For better, for worse.
- For better, for worse.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.497
- For richer, for poorer.
- For richer, for poorer.

01:01:44.498 --> 01:01:47.792
- In sickness and in health.
- In sickness and in health.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.628
- To love and to cherish.
- To love and to cherish.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.667
Till death do us part.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.177
Till death do us part.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.464
- And there to...
- And there to...

01:01:56.671 --> 01:02:01.472
- I plight thee my troth.
- I plight thee my troth.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.814
- In the name of the Father.
- In the name of the Father.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.395
- And of the Son.
- And of the Son.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:11.528
- And of the Holy Spirit.
- And of the Holy Spirit.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.322
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:26.334
Dominus Vobiscum et cum spritu tuo...

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.761
Oh!

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:46.180
Oh, bless me! Bless me! I...

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.060
Dear God, I don't know what to do.

01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:50.058
Calm yourself, Miss Pross. Calm yourself.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:51.568
He doesn't know me.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.816
Dr. Manette doesn't know me.

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:57.324
- What are you talking about?
- Come with me, please.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.391
My dear friend.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:25.268
Dr. Manette.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.309
Look at me, please.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.728
Sir, this is not your proper occupation.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:37.568
Think, my dear friend, think.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:56.717
Lucie, is anything wrong?

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.101
Are you all right?

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:14.484
I've been thinking about Mr. Carton.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:16.394
Oh.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.371
I know he's a difficult man.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:32.873
But I would ask you to be lenient with his faults.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.216
I think he has a heart he very seldom reveals.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.222
A heart with deep wounds in it.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.384
I know.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:50.595
Oh, Lucie.

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:55.609
Here we are, so strong in our happiness.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:59.112
And yet, if you had turned away from me,

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:03.025
if you had rejected my proposal of marriage,

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.488
I might have found myself

01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:07.158
in the same position as Sydney Carton.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.707
He loves you.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.955
I'm certain of it.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.201
Doctor?

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.079
Good morning, Miss Pross.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.411
Oh, do you suppose I might have some breakfast?

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:53.791
I, uh...

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:57.292
Yes, of course. At once.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.297
Thank you.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.928
Come in.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:10.054
- Mr. Lorry is here, Doctor.
- Oh.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:11.718
Don't get up, Doctor.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.519
Don't get up. Finish your breakfast.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.273
I'll join you for a cup of tea. Miss Pross.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.817
My dear friend. My dear, clear friend.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.941
All but finished.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.982
- You're well this morning?
- I am, yes.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.821
Mm-hmm.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:31.913
If I may, Doctor, I am anxious for your opinion.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:35.917
A curious case. It involves a very clear friend of mine.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:40.296
Advise me well, for his sake and his daughter's.

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:42.833
What are you suggesting?

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.760
An affliction.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.338
It has borne this gentleman down in the past,

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.849
and yet, he apparently recovered.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:54.428
And now, it's returned.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.062
Hmm...

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.477
You spoke of his daughter.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.738
Does she know of this relapse?

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.739
- No.
- Oh, thank heaven.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:10.402
- Can you tell me how it came about?
- An association from the past.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:14.493
It was strong, intense, and lurking in the mind.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.750
- Is it likely to happen again?
- Oh, no.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.002
That is good comfort, sir.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.662
- And yet...
- Yes?

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.001
This occupation...

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.666
During the affliction.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:26.960
This making of shoes.

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:30.847
If perhaps the necessary tools could be...

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:36.395
Well, if they were gone, could not the fear go with them?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.976
- They are old companions.
- I know.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.768
I know.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:49.612
But I inquire for your daughter's sake as well.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.736
Can it not be done?

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:28.104
It could never happen in this country.
The monarchy is far too stable.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.273
Don't you agree, Doctor?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.692
Frenchmen!

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:34.031
Forgive me, Charles, but, oh, really.

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:35.866
I can't understand it.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.288
Scoundrels... absolute scoundrels.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.417
Forgive me, Charles. I can only
thank God that I'm not French.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.953
- Things will settle down eventually.
- Eventually?

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.584
Oh, "eventually".

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.875
They've had years now, and it's worse than ever.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:52.091
It's more than your life's worth
to set foot in the damn country.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:56.300
Where is she? Did you see her? Did she come by this way?

01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:58.301
I thought the child was with you, Miss Pross.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.640
- She took a biscuit and she ran away.
- Oh.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:04.182
It's time, I think, to apply the paddle.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:07.939
Not guilty!

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.645
Who took the biscuit?

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.899
I am the counsel for this beautiful creature,

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.734
and I say to the court that she is not guilty.

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:17.819
- Who took the biscuit?
- I did.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:21.073
You are a gentleman, sir, but you are also a liar.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.788
Miss Pross!

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.703
- Come, little one, change horses.
- Father.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:29.465
- It's time to take your afternoon nap.
- No.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.546
Ooh-wah.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:33.841
Good-bye, Mr. Carton.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.510
Well, that's an excellent suggestion if I ever heard one.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.768
- What do you say, Mr. Lorry?
- I am at your service, sir.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.805
If you will excuse us, my dear.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:03.124
You know, I don't think I've ever told you

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:08.459
how much I appreciate these visits with your family.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.173
We enjoy them, too, Mr. Carton.

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:14.336
Indeed, you are like a part of the family to us.

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:20.721
I worry about you, you know.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:25.055
You are looking so pale these days.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:28.061
Indeed. Well...

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.270
The life I lead, you see,
is not conducive to good health.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.063
Can you not change your life?

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.148
Too late, I'm afraid.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.908
I shall never be better than I am.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:42.409
There, you have it.

01:10:43.781 --> 01:10:47.001
I'm like one who has died young, you see.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.955
All my life...

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:52.590
might have been.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.501
No.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.591
No. I refuse to believe that.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.099
Oh, I may once have had ideas about striving fresh,

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:02.846
beginning anew,

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.683
shaking off this sloth,

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.894
fighting out the abandoned fight.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.518
A dream...

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.316
All a dream.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.745
But I do wish you to know that...

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:36.005
- You inspired it.
- Mr. Carton.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:39.671
Oh, if you could have returned the love I have for you,

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.135
I might well have brought you nothing but disgrace...

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.933
and misery.

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:47.265
Indeed, the low habits that I scorn at this very moment

01:11:47.428 --> 01:11:49.851
I will yield to, again and again.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.686
Is there no way that I...

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:05.329
that I can turn your affection for me
into some good account?

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:11.328
All that you could ever do for me...

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:13.622
has been done.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.709
But you must believe me when I say

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:21.925
that I would embrace any sacrifice for you in this world.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.938
Indeed.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.397
I would gladly give my life.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.889
Friends!

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.764
Patriots!

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:16.483
Countrymen!

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.644
- Are we ready?
- Yes!

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:23.157
Then, let us go forward at last,
never to turn back again!

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:24.483
To the Bastille!

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.698
To the Bastille!

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:29.114
Will you go with me, wife?

01:13:29.115 --> 01:13:31.741
I go at the head of the women.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.252
To the Bastille!

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:37.331
To the Bastille!

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.424
Charge!

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.112
Ahhh!

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.672
Ahhh!

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:30.766
Aahh!

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:37.185
Aahh!

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.856
Aahh!

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.271
Aahh!

01:15:27.815 --> 01:15:29.362
Commander!

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:43.085
Aahh!

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:53.762
Get downstairs! Go on! Come on, old man!

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:56.848
Get down! Move!

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.887
Monsieur?

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.856
Monsieur Le Gouveneur?

01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:03.609
May I please, I beg you.

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:07.314
May I have the honor?

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:24.167
Thank you, Monsieur.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.916
At last.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.381
It has come at last.

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:33.097
It is only the beginning!

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.648
Get out! Get out!

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.021
Get him!

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.121
Halt!

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.581
No! No!

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.546
No! No!

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:18.076
No! Stop! Put me down!

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.410
Aahh!

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.922
No, no!

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:35.757
- Seize him!
- No, no! Please don't, no!

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.763
No! No! No!

01:18:47.264 --> 01:18:48.641
Mr. Lorry, please.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:51.230
There, sir, in his office.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.525
Come in.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.359
My dear Charles. How good of you to come.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.783
These are very trying days for us here.

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:04.745
- My time is so limited.
- I hope not too trying.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.706
The situation in France... hopeless.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:10.462
If the bank's documents are seized or destroyed,

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:12.999
it could bring about untold mischief.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:15.259
No, indeed, I shall have to go to France myself.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.419
You should be very careful, then.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.884
I'm an English citizen, they dare not touch me.

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:22.966
And yet, to undertake such a journey...

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.935
Your loyalty to the bank is quite remarkable.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:28.394
Loyalty, duty. It's all the same to me.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:31.058
I'm a businessman, and always will be.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:34.399
And, of course, I shall have
Jerry Cruncher to keep me company.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:37.531
Now, let me see, where did I put that letter?

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:39.608
Ah, here we are.

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.411
It's addressed to Charles Darnay.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.993
"Heretofore Charles St. Evremonde of France."

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.328
And it was sent to you.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:50.051
In the hope, I gather, that the bank
might be able to forward it.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.953
- From Paris.
- Yes.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.252
- May I?
- Of course.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:13.859
I hope I haven't brought you unwelcome news.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.353
Monsieur Gabelle.

01:20:17.354 --> 01:20:19.903
A man who worked for my uncle.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.285
He wanted to come to England
with me, but I couldn't manage it.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:27.244
And now he's been placed under arrest.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.079
But why?

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.664
For working in the house of St. Evremonde.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:34.292
All those who served St. Evremonde are now in prison.

01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:35.923
Good heavens.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:40.877
"I entreat you, please, to release me
from this prison of horror."

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:44.382
For the love of justice and the honor of your noble name.

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:48.769
I have done nothing but to serve and honor your family.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:54.229
I beg you, before the hour of my destruction.

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.189
"Help me."

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.989
- "Gabelle".
- Mmh.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:04.152
There's nothing you can do, of course.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.504
I must go to Paris.

01:21:15.662 --> 01:21:17.915
That would be far too dangerous.

01:21:18.082 --> 01:21:20.676
If there's anything I can do
to save this man, then, I must go!

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:23.303
- But, please, Charles!
- I gave him my promise...

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:28.184
my sacred promise, that no harm would come to him.

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:30.185
But, please, think of your family.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.975
They mustn't know.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:39.565
Not until after I have gone,
or my resolution might weaken.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.480
- When do you intend to leave?
- Tomorrow morning.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.482
Too soon. I shan't be able to join you.

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:48.113
Well, think about it. I beg of you, reconsider.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:53.455
I have only to look at this letter,
and my mind is made up.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.003
I have no other course.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.874
Good-bye, Mr. Lorry.

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.459
Godspeed on your journey.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.253
And yours, sir.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.423
And yours.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.256
Are you going out?

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.262
Yes.

01:22:47.421 --> 01:22:50.891
I have an engagement. One of my classes.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.147
There's a chill tonight. Keep a scarf about you.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.609
I shall.

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:39.825
Your papers, citizen.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:53.301
I'll give you an escort to Paris.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:56.433
An escort? Whatever for? I don't need one.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:59.766
Silence, aristocrat.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:02.397
You'll have an escort, and you'll pay for it.

01:25:02.398 --> 01:25:04.517
I have no choice?

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.811
Choice... Listen to him!

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:08.896
You'll pay dearly.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:12.404
And you will thank your God for our protection.

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.818
Can't you see I'm here under my own free will?

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:19.494
- You are a cursed aristocrat.
- Leave him be.

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:22.535
He'll be judged in Paris.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:24.749
Judged? What are you talking about?

01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:26.504
Yes, judged and condemned as a traitor.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.917
My friends, you deceive yourselves. I am no traitor!

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:30.959
Enough!

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.220
You will very quickly discover, Monsieur,

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.881
that we have a decree banning all aristocrats

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:39.059
and condemning to death those that return.

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.978
Now...

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.649
About the money for the escort.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.859
One hundred Louis!

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.501
Send him on.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:07.723
Get out!

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:10.854
Where are the papers of this prisoner?

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:13.691
I ask you, sir, to take notice that I am a free traveler

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.151
and a French citizen.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:18.408
Where are the papers of this prisoner?

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.377
- All right.
- Come with me.

01:27:29.536 --> 01:27:31.163
Defarge?

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:32.501
Defarge!

01:27:32.664 --> 01:27:34.712
We have another one.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.927
You will come with me.

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.808
Come on.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.585
You are the aristocrat, St. Evremonde?

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.838
I am St. Evremonde.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:15.291
- Married?
- Yes.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:17.676
Where is your wife?

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:18.926
In England.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:23.135
- We were married in England.
- Without doubt.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:27.891
You are now consigned, Evremonde,
to the prison of La Force.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.397
For what reason?!

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.818
- Haven't I the right at least...?
- Aristocrats have no rights!

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.029
Take him away.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.844
You. It is you?

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:02.128
Sir?

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:05.056
Your wife is the daughter of Dr. Manette?

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:06.467
You know him?

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:09.603
The doctor is known by all good patriots.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.595
My name is Defarge.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:13.940
I keep a wine shop on St. Antoine.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.942
You have heard of me?

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.195
It was your house, Monsieur,

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:20.193
where Dr. Manette was found by my wife.

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:21.856
I must ask you...

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:26.033
Why, in the name of heaven and hell,
did you ever come back to France?

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.368
To save the life of a devoted servant.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:32.284
That is all. That is the truth.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:36.000
It is a bad truth, and you are a fool, Monsieur.

01:29:36.162 --> 01:29:40.633
We have a newly-born female here called "La Guillotine".

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.429
Can you render me some assistance?

01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:46.431
None.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:49.510
Can you answer a single question?

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:51.553
Say what it is.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:55.436
Am I to have any communication here
with the outside world?

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:57.067
No.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:30:01.446
There is an English gentleman here in Paris,

01:30:01.605 --> 01:30:04.905
a banker by the name of Jarvis Lorry.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:07.160
Would you please tell him

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.660
that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force?

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:12.665
Just that, that only.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:14.246
I will do nothing for you.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.704
My duty is to my country and the people.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:20.591
I am the sworn servant of the people against you.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.051
I will do nothing.

01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:16.536
Excuse me, sir.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.951
Well, what did you find out?

01:32:20.326 --> 01:32:21.919
Bad news, sir.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:24.331
The information's reliable, they assured me that.

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:26.170
Tell me, tell me.

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:29.176
They've taken him prisoner and locked him up.

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:30.882
Oh my God!

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.344
He's under the name of St. Evremonde,

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:34.720
marked in secret.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.305
What does that mean?

01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:39.058
I'm afraid, it means solitary confinement.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.565
There is no way we can reach him. Not now.

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:45.694
- Sorry, sir.
- All right, Jerry.

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.947
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, that's all.

01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:51.984
Oh, dear.

01:33:01.034 --> 01:33:02.661
Oh.

01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:08.209
"My dear Dr. Manette."

01:33:08.374 --> 01:33:10.626
It is with the utmost regret

01:33:10.627 --> 01:33:14.257
"that I bring you this most unfortunate news."

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.681
What can we do?

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:27.815
- I shall go to Paris immediately.
- Mr. Lorry said that...

01:33:27.977 --> 01:33:30.856
I was a prisoner in the Bastille for over 16 years.

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:32.569
They know me.

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:35.281
They know what I endured at the hands of the nobility.

01:33:35.282 --> 01:33:38.951
They will listen to me. I am certain of it.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:42.166
- I'll go with you.
- Oh, no.

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:43.577
Father, don't you see,

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:47.043
I can't possibly stay here without knowing?

01:33:47.205 --> 01:33:48.878
That I...

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.793
I've got to go with you. There's no question about it.

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.055
I'll tell Miss Pross. How soon can we leave?

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:56.886
Father!

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:55.614
Oh, no, sir.

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.821
Mr. Lorry left for France over three weeks ago.

01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:00.328
- I don't know when he'll be back.
- France?

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:01.954
Yes, sir.

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.081
Do you know if the Darnays travelled with him?

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.993
No, sir, he was travelling alone.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:12.340
They're here! They're here!

01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:15.377
What are you talking about?
Who's here? You might knock...

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:16.795
Lucie!

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:18.087
Dr. Manette!

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:19.471
I don't understand.

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.299
We received your letter.

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:23.218
But I had no thought of you coming here.

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.933
We simply couldn't remain in London
under the circumstances.

01:35:26.095 --> 01:35:28.223
I assure you, I've done everything I possibly could.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:31.188
You, my dear friend, are not Alexandre Manette.

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:33.979
There is no patriot in Paris who does not know my name,

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:36.443
and none who would touch me.

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:39.780
I shall use that influence now for whatever it is worth.

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.952
There is still some killing in the streets.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:47.037
They drag the prisoners from their cells and...

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:47.996
What?!

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.879
Oh, it's all right my dear. It's all right.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:51.917
Charles is quite safe, as yet.

01:35:53.498 --> 01:35:56.468
And, Doctor, if you have the power you say you have,

01:35:56.626 --> 01:36:00.051
then, make yourself known
to these devils, for God's sake.

01:36:00.213 --> 01:36:03.843
- Make them take you to La Force.
- I shall do so at once.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.806
Father!

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:10.189
Have faith, my dear.

01:36:13.977 --> 01:36:16.071
Who is he? Kill him!

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:18.982
Listen to me! Please, I beg you.

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:21.446
- Listen to me!
- Kill him!

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:23.031
Give the knife to him!

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:27.199
Look at me! Listen to me!

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:35.416
I am Alexandre Manette. Do you know the name?

01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:40.257
For 16 years, a prisoner in the Bastille.

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:43.720
Manette? Manette? You are the physician!

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:46.100
Yes, Dr. Manette.

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:49.429
Locked in a solitary cell,

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:54.146
without sight of one human being for over 16 years.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:58.815
I know the pain. I know the suffering you endure.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:01.153
I am a victim, as all of you.

01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:04.865
I am one of you!

01:37:05.028 --> 01:37:06.655
What do you want?

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:08.827
Freedom!

01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:11.368
For my own daughter's clear husband.

01:37:12.118 --> 01:37:15.668
A terrible mistake, they have taken him to La Force.

01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:18.382
I beg you to take me there.

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:22.887
Help me to set him free!

01:37:23.046 --> 01:37:25.765
Take the prisoner and La Force!

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:30.095
Take the prisoner!

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.434
To La Force!

01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:34.181
Make way!

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.435
Make way!

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:12.140
I have a message from Dr. Manette.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.180
Just a moment.

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.156
Monsieur Defarge?

01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:33.700
The same, Monsieur.

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:35.910
I bring you a message from Dr. Manette.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:40.875
Believe me, I'd only do this for the good doctor.

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:44.215
I have another message for Miss Lucie Manette.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:47.130
- Can you take me to her?
- We'll go at once. I'll just get...

01:38:47.296 --> 01:38:49.719
My wife, Monsieur. She will join us.

01:38:51.092 --> 01:38:52.059
For what purpose?

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:55.688
So that she might recognize the faces better, Monsieur.

01:38:55.888 --> 01:38:58.016
For their own safety.

01:38:58.724 --> 01:39:00.852
I see.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:10.569
It's from Charles.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:12.072
He...

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:14.286
He says that he...

01:39:18.661 --> 01:39:20.004
Well...

01:39:24.459 --> 01:39:26.553
He says that my father has influence.

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:28.964
- Let us hope so.
- It is enough.

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.258
I have seen them. We may go.

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:34.143
Please, Madame, you will help me to see him if you can.

01:39:34.144 --> 01:39:37.685
Your husband is not my business. It is you.

01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:41.226
Then, for my sake, please be merciful to my husband.

01:39:42.351 --> 01:39:44.979
What does your husband say in the letter?

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:46.648
"Influence?"

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.033
- Influence?
- Yes!

01:39:49.192 --> 01:39:51.069
Then, let that release him.

01:39:52.111 --> 01:39:54.409
I implore you, Madame.

01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:04.210
As a woman.

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:06.796
- As a wife.
- Oh, yes.

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:09.178
We've all seen our women suffer.

01:40:09.337 --> 01:40:12.172
And our husbands, and our children.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:16.519
Our children, dying in the street of poverty and hunger,

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.395
thirst and misery.

01:40:20.806 --> 01:40:26.609
Do you think the troubles of one wife
means anything to us now?

01:40:47.583 --> 01:40:51.133
You have, Dr. Manette,
been a secret prisoner in the Bastille

01:40:51.134 --> 01:40:53.551
for a period of over 16 years.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.257
That is true.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:57.352
And now, today, you appear before us

01:40:57.510 --> 01:41:00.434
to seek the release of Monseigneur St. Evermonde,

01:41:00.596 --> 01:41:03.065
who calls himself Charles Darnay.

01:41:03.224 --> 01:41:04.692
Yes.

01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:06.568
Hmm.

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.822
We have, good citizen, considered your request,

01:41:10.022 --> 01:41:12.775
and we've made our decision.

01:41:12.942 --> 01:41:15.411
The prisoner must remain in custody.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.282
For how long?

01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:21.917
You've heard our decision. That is all.

01:41:21.918 --> 01:41:23.456
For how long?

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:28.045
There will be a trial in the future, Monsieur. Good day.

01:41:28.207 --> 01:41:30.301
But prisoners are being dragged out of their cells

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:31.836
and slaughtered in the streets.

01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:36.049
St. Evremonde will be held
in safe custody, I promise you.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:40.011
And I promise you, Monsieur Le President,

01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:41.303
that I shall not leave Paris

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:43.313
until his freedom has been accomplished.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:59.663
They will not release him.

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:04.544
Oh, frightful. It's frightful.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.000
They've already beheaded the King and Queen,

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:09.757
and still they have tribunals
springing up all over the country.

01:42:09.915 --> 01:42:12.293
The revolution keeps growing.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:13.632
Hm.

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:16.422
Do you know they speak
of the guillotine as a female figure,

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:19.257
even make jokes about it?

01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:21.306
They say it's the best cure for a headache.

01:42:21.469 --> 01:42:23.346
Prevents the hair from going grey.

01:42:23.512 --> 01:42:25.935
Madness. Madness!

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.359
What in God's name do we do now?

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:30.736
- Wait for his trial.
- And then?

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:32.646
I will speak.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:35.491
Indeed, I will speak.

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:41.572
Take heed, sir.

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.161
I beg your pardon.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:46.544
If I was you, sir, I wouldn't put
one foot on France at this moment.

01:42:46.702 --> 01:42:49.125
Not for a million shillings, I wouldn't.

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:53.172
Know what I mean, sir?

01:42:57.755 --> 01:43:00.099
Thank you for the warning.

01:43:24.573 --> 01:43:27.747
Oh, Lucy! Look! Look!

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:29.162
At the highest window.

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:31.001
I can see someone waving.

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:32.331
It's father!

01:43:32.498 --> 01:43:33.841
Yes, I think it is.

01:43:33.999 --> 01:43:36.923
Oh, wave to him, darling! Wave, wave!

01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:38.759
There you are!

01:44:09.535 --> 01:44:11.788
Hey, milady!

01:44:12.997 --> 01:44:15.967
Why don't you come and see the execution, milady?

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:22.636
Straight to the guillotine!

01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:34.568
I salute you, citizeness.

01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:37.563
I salute you.

01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.778
Tomorrow.

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:42.068
What?

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.950
Tomorrow, we shall see.

01:44:55.664 --> 01:44:59.043
And, therefore, for crimes against the Republic

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:01.879
and crimes against the citizens of the Republic,

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:04.674
you are sentenced to death by the guillotine.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.639
- Take him away.
- Off with his head!

01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:12.102
Off with his head!

01:45:19.855 --> 01:45:25.362
Charles St. Evremonde, called Darnay!

01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:46.514
Kill him!

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:48.847
Death to Evermonde!

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:50.977
Charles St. Evremonde.

01:45:51.136 --> 01:45:53.680
You are accused as an aristocrat,

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:55.683
whose life is forfeit to the Republic.

01:45:56.559 --> 01:45:59.984
Kill him! Off with his head! Kill him!

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:07.490
Silence! Silence!

01:46:07.653 --> 01:46:11.783
The prisoner may speak if he so desires. Monsieur?

01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:16.253
Your Honor.

01:46:16.412 --> 01:46:19.757
I no longer feel myself to be an aristocrat.

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:23.586
I have voluntarily relinquished a title,

01:46:23.752 --> 01:46:26.881
that I assure you, was distasteful to me.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:30.142
I gave up all my property long ago.

01:46:30.342 --> 01:46:34.679
And I have been living by my own industry in England.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.934
Yes. Is there anything else?

01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:40.819
I've married a woman in England.

01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:41.900
Oh!

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:45.032
Who is the daughter of citizen Alexandre Manette,

01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:47.784
who sits with us here today.

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:50.153
Why have you returned to France?

01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:53.624
To try to save the life of a prisoner here.

01:46:53.782 --> 01:46:55.955
Is that a crime in the eyes of the Republic?

01:46:56.118 --> 01:47:00.294
This tribunal will ask the questions, Monsieur.

01:47:00.456 --> 01:47:03.458
Have you any more statements to make?

01:47:03.459 --> 01:47:08.761
This prisoner, this man, has already met his fate.

01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:12.427
I simply wish now to return to England.

01:47:13.886 --> 01:47:16.856
And I should like to call upon Dr. Manette,

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:19.608
so that this tribunal might hear his words.

01:47:33.072 --> 01:47:38.420
This prisoner stands before you as one of my own family,

01:47:38.577 --> 01:47:43.299
as one dear to my heart
as my own flesh and blood would be.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:47.212
He has been honorable to me and devoted to my daughter.

01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:50.681
He has never once spoken in favor of the aristocracy,

01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:53.092
to me or to anyone else.

01:47:53.258 --> 01:47:57.513
On the contrary, he has renounced it before the world.

01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.602
Oh!

01:47:58.764 --> 01:48:01.859
He has given up his title, his worldly goods,

01:48:02.017 --> 01:48:05.567
and I ask you not to take his life.

01:48:07.606 --> 01:48:14.535
I ask you, I beg you, as a citizen, as a patriot.

01:48:14.697 --> 01:48:17.621
Do not take his life.

01:48:19.451 --> 01:48:22.250
Have you anything more to say?

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:25.792
No.

01:48:25.958 --> 01:48:28.543
The jury will render its verdict.

01:48:28.544 --> 01:48:31.297
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:32.722
Not guilty.

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:34.849
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:36.010
Not guilty.

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:37.760
Not guilty.

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:40.184
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty.

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.690
Not guilty.

01:48:41.849 --> 01:48:43.066
Not guilty.

01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:51.325
You've heard the verdict of the jury.

01:48:51.525 --> 01:48:55.280
The prisoner is declared by this tribunal to be free.

01:48:57.239 --> 01:49:00.914
Well, it is done.

01:49:01.076 --> 01:49:02.293
Is it?

01:49:02.494 --> 01:49:04.622
Have you not heard?

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.290
I am a patient woman.

01:49:06.457 --> 01:49:09.336
The time will come.

01:49:09.501 --> 01:49:10.878
What is that?

01:49:11.045 --> 01:49:13.594
- The writings of Dr. Manette.
- Hm?

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:16.726
Oh, yes, his very own words.

01:49:16.884 --> 01:49:21.105
We found his diary in his room,
did we not, my good husband?

01:49:22.556 --> 01:49:24.932
Patience.

01:49:24.933 --> 01:49:27.356
Not long now.

01:49:29.021 --> 01:49:31.615
Not long now.

01:50:05.724 --> 01:50:07.692
Now, Mr. Cruncher, I'm ready if you are.

01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:09.694
As your service, Miss Pross.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.698
We are going out for food and wine.

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:18.612
We shall be back shortly.

01:50:18.779 --> 01:50:21.282
It's dark, Miss Pross. Do you think it's safe?

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:25.294
- I have Mr. Cruncher to protect me.
- Absolutely.

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:29.958
But we shall be careful, mind you.
I don't trust any of these savages.

01:50:30.124 --> 01:50:32.001
They have two thoughts in their mind,

01:50:32.167 --> 01:50:33.293
murder and mischief!

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.928
I can vouch for that.

01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:36.801
The short and long of it is

01:50:36.802 --> 01:50:39.346
that I am a subject of his most gracious majesty,

01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:41.636
King George the Third.

01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:44.851
And I say, confound the French and their politics,

01:50:45.013 --> 01:50:47.107
and their knavish tricks.

01:50:47.266 --> 01:50:49.769
On George, our hopes we fix.

01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:51.482
God Save the King!

01:50:51.687 --> 01:50:53.735
Be cautious, Miss Pross.

01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:55.695
We're not out of France as yet.

01:50:55.858 --> 01:50:58.657
Speaking for myself, it can't be soon enough.

01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:01.072
We shall make arrangements tomorrow.

01:51:01.238 --> 01:51:04.037
I don't think any of us wish
to stay here longer than we have to.

01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:05.997
- What is that?
- I beg your pardon.

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:07.878
I thought I heard someone on the stairs.

01:51:08.036 --> 01:51:09.003
I heard no one.

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:13.049
It's them. They're coming back for you.

01:51:14.376 --> 01:51:16.879
- Quickly, hide.
- It's all right, Miss Pross.

01:51:17.045 --> 01:51:19.719
Charles has been set free now.

01:51:25.012 --> 01:51:25.979
What is this?

01:51:26.138 --> 01:51:29.142
Citizen St. Evremonde, called Darnay?

01:51:29.308 --> 01:51:30.434
Yes!

01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:32.815
- You are Evremonde.
- I am.

01:51:33.645 --> 01:51:36.272
You are once again, Monsieur, a prisoner of the Republic.

01:51:36.273 --> 01:51:37.775
Hold him!

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.827
Why?

01:51:40.986 --> 01:51:43.455
Tell me why am I again a prisoner?

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:45.953
You'll find out tomorrow. You're summoned for tomorrow.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:49.336
Sir, I do not understand. How can this happen?

01:51:49.494 --> 01:51:51.622
He's been denounced, Citizen Doctor.

01:51:51.788 --> 01:51:53.381
- He's been accused.
- By whom?

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.462
Ask no more.

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:56.345
If the Republic demands a sacrifice of you,

01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:59.968
then, you, as a good patriot, will be happy to make it.

01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:02.132
The Republic goes before all.

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:04.893
- The people are supreme.
- Sir!

01:52:05.052 --> 01:52:09.055
I beg of you to tell me at least who denounced him.

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:11.150
It is against the rules, good Doctor.

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:12.434
But the prisoner has been denounced

01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:14.569
by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge.

01:52:17.064 --> 01:52:20.534
- There was one other.
- What other?

01:52:20.734 --> 01:52:23.738
You'll find out tomorrow. Now, come along!

01:52:24.321 --> 01:52:25.163
- No!
- Lucie!

01:52:25.322 --> 01:52:28.201
No! No! Leave him alone!

01:52:28.367 --> 01:52:30.540
Leave him alone!

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:36.508
Savages!

01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:11.076
Who is it?

01:53:12.119 --> 01:53:13.746
It's me, sir.

01:53:13.912 --> 01:53:16.210
A gentleman to see you, sir. An English gentleman.

01:53:16.373 --> 01:53:17.374
English?

01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:19.839
Bless me soul, if it isn't Sydney Carton.

01:53:20.002 --> 01:53:23.006
Good heavens! Show him in at once.

01:53:25.966 --> 01:53:26.967
My dear fellow.

01:53:27.134 --> 01:53:29.512
You are the last person I'd expect to find in France.

01:53:29.678 --> 01:53:31.305
Darnay is in prison, is he not?

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:35.851
Yes. And there's nothing you can do to help him. Nothing.

01:53:36.018 --> 01:53:37.520
We shall see about that.

01:53:37.686 --> 01:53:39.404
Dr. Manette has done all he can,

01:53:39.563 --> 01:53:43.443
and he has more influence
with these people than you or I.

01:53:43.608 --> 01:53:46.737
Believe me, Charles Darnay remains in prison.

01:53:46.903 --> 01:53:50.658
And I don't think the good Lord
Himself could set him free now.

01:53:50.866 --> 01:53:57.294
In that case, maybe the Devil can accomplish it.

01:54:01.585 --> 01:54:03.428
Miss Pross?

01:54:09.009 --> 01:54:11.011
Miss Pross?

01:54:13.805 --> 01:54:15.022
Here we are.

01:54:15.182 --> 01:54:17.150
Oh, there you are.

01:54:17.934 --> 01:54:19.982
Mommy! Mommy!

01:55:15.409 --> 01:55:18.128
- Good morning, citizen.
- Good morning.

01:55:18.286 --> 01:55:20.960
I believe the name is Barsad, John Barsad,

01:55:21.123 --> 01:55:23.672
sometimes called Guillerman.

01:55:23.875 --> 01:55:24.842
What do you want?

01:55:25.001 --> 01:55:28.676
I saw you testify at the Old Bailey
against Charles Darnay.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.632
- What of it?
- Indeed.

01:55:30.799 --> 01:55:33.518
Once a spy, always a spy.

01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:36.976
And now I see you work here in the prison.

01:55:37.139 --> 01:55:38.937
A spy once again for the prison guards.

01:55:39.099 --> 01:55:41.443
Do you like working in prison?

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:45.151
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, not so quickly, citizen.

01:55:45.313 --> 01:55:48.157
I think I might well use a friend in prison such as you.

01:55:48.316 --> 01:55:49.567
I'm no friend of yours.

01:55:49.568 --> 01:55:53.038
Oh, but you are, whether you like it or not.

01:55:55.157 --> 01:55:57.410
Don't you understand?

01:55:57.576 --> 01:55:59.954
I hold all the cards.

01:56:00.954 --> 01:56:03.798
What are you talking about?

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:07.302
Mr. Barsad.

01:56:07.461 --> 01:56:09.714
My dear fellow.

01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:13.516
I think for your own sake, you had better come with me.

01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:18.101
And we shall discuss it.

01:56:30.358 --> 01:56:32.656
Well, Mr. Lorry.

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:34.653
What do you think?

01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:38.625
I agree with you. Once a spy, always a spy.

01:56:38.783 --> 01:56:42.413
- You can't prove a thing.
- Prove?

01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:44.581
What do I need of proof?

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:51.128
I shall simply denounce you
to the nearest Citizen's Committee.

01:56:51.129 --> 01:56:54.724
John Barsad, alias Guillerman,

01:56:54.883 --> 01:56:59.059
who once worked for the noble Lords of France.

01:57:00.055 --> 01:57:02.774
Can you stand such an investigation?

01:57:03.308 --> 01:57:08.405
Will they discover unpleasant things about you?

01:57:09.648 --> 01:57:12.367
- It's blackmail.
- Ah!

01:57:12.526 --> 01:57:16.695
Now, there you have it, at last.

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:18.164
My ace.

01:57:20.825 --> 01:57:22.327
Well...

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:26.957
Look over your own cards and see what you have.

01:57:27.123 --> 01:57:29.125
Look into your unsavory past

01:57:29.292 --> 01:57:32.466
and tell me what your chances are now.

01:57:35.298 --> 01:57:36.675
- I...
- Yes?

01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:38.388
Did you say something?

01:57:39.386 --> 01:57:42.139
About your cards, perhaps?

01:57:43.014 --> 01:57:44.607
Or mine?

01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:48.979
You have a good hand, sir.

01:57:49.145 --> 01:57:52.615
You might even call it a guillotine hand.

01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:58.447
Do you Play?

01:58:02.117 --> 01:58:03.744
What do you want of me?

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:06.254
It's a very simple request.

01:58:06.413 --> 01:58:09.007
If things should go ill
with the prisoner, Charles Darnay,

01:58:09.165 --> 01:58:10.542
then, I must have access to him.

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:13.212
- Impossible!
- Just once.

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:22.308
Or do you prefer that I play my hand?

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.060
Having access to the prisoner will not save him.

01:58:27.142 --> 01:58:28.610
Just once.

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:32.739
I tell you, there's no such thing
as escape from La Force.

01:58:34.983 --> 01:58:36.735
Just once.

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:49.164
Very well.

01:58:51.625 --> 01:58:53.627
Thank you, Mr. Barsad.

01:58:53.793 --> 01:58:57.468
You may be certain that I shall be
in touch with you very shortly.

01:58:58.548 --> 01:59:00.767
In fact...

01:59:00.925 --> 01:59:02.552
sooner than you might think.

01:59:02.719 --> 01:59:04.346
Good day, sir.

01:59:13.521 --> 01:59:15.731
Hmm...

01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:17.780
I don't understand.

01:59:17.942 --> 01:59:19.068
The man's quite right.

01:59:19.235 --> 01:59:22.455
There's no way of escape, so what good would it do?

01:59:22.614 --> 01:59:24.907
My dear Mr. Lorry...

01:59:24.908 --> 01:59:29.539
Please, I ask only that you do not tell the Manettes

01:59:29.704 --> 01:59:30.671
of this arrangement.

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.834
In fact, I think it best if I do not see them

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.968
while I'm here in Paris at all.

01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:38.171
As you wish.

01:59:40.924 --> 01:59:42.926
Bear up, Mr. Lorry.

01:59:44.636 --> 01:59:46.354
Courage!

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:14.249
Good evening, citizen.

02:00:23.341 --> 02:00:25.594
Good evening, citizen.

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:27.307
How goes the Republic?

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:30.639
Excellent. It is very good.

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:32.938
63 today.

02:00:33.768 --> 02:00:35.686
Do you watch them?

02:00:35.687 --> 02:00:38.440
Always. I never miss them.

02:00:38.606 --> 02:00:42.702
You ought to go and see for yourself
when there's a good clay.

02:00:45.447 --> 02:00:47.495
Good night, citizen.

02:01:20.899 --> 02:01:22.401
Forgive me, citizen,

02:01:22.567 --> 02:01:25.036
but may I keep you open for another moment or two?

02:01:25.236 --> 02:01:27.284
Come in, come in.

02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:29.324
What can we do for you?

02:01:40.293 --> 02:01:41.795
For you, Monsieur?

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:43.383
For me.

02:02:02.065 --> 02:02:06.662
You must be careful, Monsieur, to keep them separate.

02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:11.791
You know the consequences of mixing them?

02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:13.076
Perfectly.

02:02:15.912 --> 02:02:17.710
Here we are.

02:02:18.665 --> 02:02:20.417
14 Louis.

02:02:30.301 --> 02:02:33.430
Be careful, citizen.

02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.319
I will try.

02:03:36.034 --> 02:03:38.787
The Public Prosecutor announces to this tribunal

02:03:38.953 --> 02:03:42.002
that the prisoner Charles St. Evermonde,

02:03:42.165 --> 02:03:44.543
called Darnay, has been denounced.

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:50.015
He has been denounced by three voices.

02:03:50.798 --> 02:03:53.426
Ernest Defarge,

02:03:55.553 --> 02:03:58.102
Therese Defarge...

02:04:00.725 --> 02:04:04.150
Well? Who is the third voice?

02:04:05.647 --> 02:04:06.990
Alexandre Manette.

02:04:12.654 --> 02:04:15.999
Quiet! I will have quiet in the chamber!

02:04:16.157 --> 02:04:17.704
Monsieur Le President,

02:04:17.867 --> 02:04:21.212
what the Public Prosecutor has stated is impossible.

02:04:21.371 --> 02:04:24.841
I have never denounced the prisoner. Never!

02:04:24.999 --> 02:04:29.095
I call upon Madame Defarge to speak to this tribunal.

02:04:35.927 --> 02:04:39.846
Patriots! Listen to me!

02:04:39.847 --> 02:04:42.942
I have something to read to you.

02:04:43.101 --> 02:04:45.103
I have in hand the diary

02:04:45.269 --> 02:04:48.022
in the handwriting of our good Doctor Manette.

02:04:48.773 --> 02:04:53.074
He wrote this diary from the moment
he was put into prison.

02:04:53.236 --> 02:04:56.160
And do you know why he was imprisoned?

02:04:56.322 --> 02:04:59.997
For trying to save the life of a dying woman.

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:03.129
Yes, a woman who had been abused

02:05:03.287 --> 02:05:07.508
by Monseigneur Philippe St. Evremonde,

02:05:07.667 --> 02:05:09.544
uncle of the prisoner.

02:05:11.963 --> 02:05:14.136
This woman died from the injuries

02:05:14.298 --> 02:05:17.017
she received at the hand of St. Evremonde.

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:20.146
The good doctor could not save her.

02:05:20.304 --> 02:05:23.649
But for reporting her death to the authorities,

02:05:23.808 --> 02:05:25.435
and for that alone,

02:05:25.601 --> 02:05:29.651
he was thrown into prison by St. Evremonde.

02:05:30.481 --> 02:05:34.202
Thrown into prison to rot, Monsieur.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.193
Death!

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:37.322
Listen to me!

02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:40.158
The words of Doctor Manette:

02:05:41.909 --> 02:05:46.540
"And so, to the Evremondes and their descendants,"

02:05:46.706 --> 02:05:50.631
to the last of their race,

02:05:50.793 --> 02:05:53.012
I, Alexandre Manette,

02:05:53.171 --> 02:05:57.017
do, this last night of the year 1761,

02:05:57.175 --> 02:05:59.143
in my unbearable agony,

02:05:59.302 --> 02:06:02.181
denounce the Evremondes.

02:06:02.346 --> 02:06:10.346
I denounce the House of Evremonde to heaven and to hell!

02:06:13.691 --> 02:06:14.988
Off with his head!

02:06:15.151 --> 02:06:20.078
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:23.243
Save him now, good Doctor.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.333
Save him now.

02:06:26.496 --> 02:06:28.715
Off with his head! Off with his head!

02:06:32.752 --> 02:06:34.129
I call for the verdict.

02:06:34.295 --> 02:06:36.093
Monsieur Le President, please!

02:06:38.758 --> 02:06:40.760
Quiet!

02:06:40.927 --> 02:06:42.224
Let's have the verdict.

02:06:42.386 --> 02:06:43.888
Guilty.

02:06:44.055 --> 02:06:45.227
Guilty.

02:06:45.389 --> 02:06:47.232
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

02:06:47.391 --> 02:06:49.689
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

02:06:49.852 --> 02:06:52.321
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.653
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

02:06:54.816 --> 02:06:57.035
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:07.500
Charles St. Evremonde, enemy of the Republic, death!

02:07:07.662 --> 02:07:10.040
Death within 24 hours!

02:07:33.187 --> 02:07:35.565
- Charles!
- No, get out!

02:07:35.731 --> 02:07:37.904
- Please let me see him, I beg you!
- No!

02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:39.660
Just for one moment.

02:07:39.819 --> 02:07:42.993
- Please, I beg you, sir.
- One moment.

02:07:43.156 --> 02:07:44.874
Charles!

02:08:01.924 --> 02:08:05.144
Believe me, sir, I didn't know.

02:08:05.303 --> 02:08:07.601
I had no idea my uncle was responsible for...

02:08:07.763 --> 02:08:10.061
- I know.
- Forgive me.

02:08:11.684 --> 02:08:13.937
There is nothing to forgive.

02:08:19.233 --> 02:08:21.327
May God protect you.

02:08:21.485 --> 02:08:23.908
That's enough. Come.

02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:25.952
Lucie!

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:28.491
Lucie!

02:08:28.492 --> 02:08:29.914
Lucie!

02:08:34.332 --> 02:08:36.460
I'll take her to your coach. Show me the way.

02:08:36.667 --> 02:08:40.467
- Mr. Carton!
- Please, Doctor, now is not the time.

02:08:40.671 --> 02:08:42.514
Show me the way!

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:32.098
She'll be all right, I think.

02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:34.518
Fetch some tea, if you will.

02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:58.424
Soon.

02:10:08.968 --> 02:10:12.563
Hey, what's the matter with you?

02:10:12.763 --> 02:10:15.437
- I am disturbed.
- Why?

02:10:15.599 --> 02:10:17.818
Dr. Manette...

02:10:17.977 --> 02:10:19.729
He's already suffered so much in his life.

02:10:19.895 --> 02:10:21.522
And he will suffer more.

02:10:21.689 --> 02:10:25.159
There are more lives here than one, Monsieur.

02:10:25.318 --> 02:10:27.286
What are you talking about?

02:10:27.445 --> 02:10:30.540
There is another St. Evremonde.

02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:33.664
Surely, you wouldn't.

02:10:33.868 --> 02:10:34.869
Not the little girl.

02:10:35.036 --> 02:10:37.789
To the last of their race.

02:10:40.374 --> 02:10:43.503
Let us put an end to it now. I beg you.

02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:45.262
Let's stop it here.

02:10:45.421 --> 02:10:47.970
Tell the fire and the wind where to stop.

02:10:47.971 --> 02:10:50.639
I shall have them all before I finish.

02:10:50.843 --> 02:10:52.686
All.

02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:55.473
Why?

02:10:56.974 --> 02:10:58.851
You know why.

02:10:59.935 --> 02:11:01.653
Tell them.

02:11:01.854 --> 02:11:04.198
Tell them why.

02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:09.527
The woman that died at the hand of St. Evremonde, she...

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:11.576
My sister!

02:11:12.406 --> 02:11:15.535
And you tell me to stop now.

02:11:16.202 --> 02:11:19.126
They shall all perish!

02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:20.665
All!

02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:22.504
All!

02:11:31.926 --> 02:11:34.304
- Who's there?
- Carton.

02:11:36.138 --> 02:11:37.230
Mr. Carton.

02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:40.860
I must speak to you alone. It's urgent, I...

02:11:42.436 --> 02:11:44.154
I'm afraid it's the shock.

02:11:44.313 --> 02:11:46.407
His mind has gone again.

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:48.533
Oh, Mr. Carton, we're lost.

02:11:48.692 --> 02:11:50.911
Our last hope is gone.

02:11:53.656 --> 02:11:56.703
- I must hold you to a promise, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

02:11:56.704 --> 02:11:57.826
This is the certificate

02:11:57.993 --> 02:11:59.666
that enabled me to pass out of the city.

02:11:59.829 --> 02:12:02.082
Sydney Carton, Englishman.

02:12:02.248 --> 02:12:05.001
- Keep it for me until tomorrow.
- But why?

02:12:05.167 --> 02:12:06.885
Because I would rather not have it with me

02:12:07.044 --> 02:12:09.263
when I visit Charles in prison.

02:12:09.422 --> 02:12:11.220
Be sure you have a doctor's certificate,

02:12:11.382 --> 02:12:13.305
Lucie's and the little one.

02:12:13.467 --> 02:12:15.267
They'll have to pass the barrier of the city.

02:12:15.386 --> 02:12:18.265
But surely you don't think they're in danger, too?

02:12:18.266 --> 02:12:21.564
No one in the House of St. Evremonde is safe.

02:12:21.725 --> 02:12:24.023
Not anymore.

02:12:24.186 --> 02:12:26.530
Their certificates can be recalled.

02:12:28.065 --> 02:12:30.568
Don't look so horrified, Mr. Lorry.

02:12:30.734 --> 02:12:33.908
- You have the chance to save them.
- I?

02:12:34.071 --> 02:12:35.994
Heaven grant that I may, but how?

02:12:36.157 --> 02:12:38.205
Get coach and horses early tomorrow morning,

02:12:38.367 --> 02:12:40.586
so that they might be ready by 2:00 in the afternoon.

02:12:40.744 --> 02:12:43.293
- Arrange it as soon as possible.
- It shall be done.

02:12:43.456 --> 02:12:45.174
Tell Lucie of the great danger,

02:12:45.332 --> 02:12:47.255
that she must leave Paris immediately.

02:12:47.418 --> 02:12:50.467
Be sure that Miss Pross'
and Mr. Cruncher's papers in order.

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:53.348
- I will.
- Have the coach standing by.

02:12:53.507 --> 02:12:57.218
The moment I arrive, take me in and drive away.

02:12:57.219 --> 02:13:00.439
- And then, for England.
- For England.

02:13:00.598 --> 02:13:04.102
Promise me solemnly that nothing will alter the course

02:13:04.268 --> 02:13:06.691
on which we now stand pledged to one another.

02:13:06.854 --> 02:13:08.356
Nothing.

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:13.610
Do you know, Mr. Lorry,

02:13:13.611 --> 02:13:17.741
when we first met, I looked upon you with contempt.

02:13:17.948 --> 02:13:21.043
Yes, I daresay I wasn't quite fond of you either.

02:13:24.413 --> 02:13:26.040
I'll take the old gentleman home.

02:13:43.307 --> 02:13:45.059
Tell me...

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:51.532
If you could look back and say
I have done nothing good at all...

02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:54.994
I have secured no one's love,

02:13:55.152 --> 02:13:57.405
or affection,

02:13:57.571 --> 02:14:00.370
or even regard,

02:14:00.533 --> 02:14:04.163
would not all of your years, then, be years wasted?

02:14:04.328 --> 02:14:07.707
Why do you speak of such things? You're still young.

02:14:09.208 --> 02:14:10.755
True.

02:14:11.794 --> 02:14:14.422
But my young way was never the way to age.

02:14:17.383 --> 02:14:21.013
Doctor. We're leaving now.

02:14:21.178 --> 02:14:23.397
Come, let me help you.

02:14:36.735 --> 02:14:37.861
Good-bye, Mr. Lorry.

02:14:39.113 --> 02:14:41.332
You're a kind and good man.

02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:43.618
I envy you.

02:14:43.784 --> 02:14:46.128
But I can't be like you.

02:15:24.908 --> 02:15:26.330
Keys.

02:15:37.212 --> 02:15:40.466
Be quick about it. I'll wait here.

02:15:52.686 --> 02:15:55.405
I know. Of all the people on this Earth,

02:15:55.564 --> 02:15:57.737
I'm the last one you expected to see.

02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:00.119
I pray to God, sir, that you are not a prisoner.

02:16:00.277 --> 02:16:02.780
No, I come here only on a request from your wife.

02:16:02.946 --> 02:16:05.916
But there's no time now to tell you
why I bring it or what it means.

02:16:06.116 --> 02:16:08.414
Take off your coat.

02:16:08.577 --> 02:16:10.955
- My coat?
- No questions.

02:16:11.121 --> 02:16:13.749
- Can't you tell me at least what...?
- No.

02:16:20.047 --> 02:16:22.641
If you have escape in mind,
I can tell you that it's hopeless.

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.430
- You will only die with me.
- I do not ask you to escape.

02:16:26.431 --> 02:16:28.101
I make no such requests.

02:16:28.263 --> 02:16:33.611
Here. Change this waistcoat of yours for mine.

02:16:34.477 --> 02:16:36.731
Believe me, it's not going to work.

02:16:36.897 --> 02:16:39.491
- The ribbon.
- It can't be done.

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:42.570
Take my coat. Hurry!

02:16:42.736 --> 02:16:44.454
Don't you know,

02:16:44.612 --> 02:16:48.584
every attempt to escape from this prison has failed?

02:16:48.742 --> 02:16:50.209
I implore you,

02:16:50.369 --> 02:16:53.213
do not add your death to the bitterness of mine.

02:16:53.956 --> 02:16:56.504
Do I ask you to walk out that door?

02:16:56.666 --> 02:16:59.671
If I should ask that, then, refuse.

02:16:59.837 --> 02:17:02.379
Now, sit down.

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.134
I have something for you to write.

02:17:06.802 --> 02:17:08.645
Sit.

02:17:11.974 --> 02:17:13.941
Is your hand steady enough?

02:17:14.101 --> 02:17:16.320
I was just writing a last note to Lucie.

02:17:16.477 --> 02:17:17.478
Good.

02:17:17.646 --> 02:17:21.071
Now you will write what I dictate, exactly as I speak.

02:17:21.275 --> 02:17:23.949
- To whom?
- To no one. Write.

02:17:31.285 --> 02:17:32.582
Well, that's what he said.

02:17:32.745 --> 02:17:34.588
- I may need you and Lebec shortly.
- Why?

02:17:34.746 --> 02:17:36.374
This visitor looks quite ill.

02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:43.343
That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.

02:18:45.275 --> 02:18:46.322
Barsad.

02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:56.082
Well, look at me.

02:18:56.245 --> 02:18:58.213
Now, do you think your hazard's so great?

02:18:58.371 --> 02:19:00.340
Not if you keep your part of the bargain.

02:19:00.499 --> 02:19:02.376
Take me to the coach.

02:19:04.294 --> 02:19:06.717
- You?
- I, him, we are the same.

02:19:06.879 --> 02:19:08.723
I have merely exchanged my life.

02:19:08.882 --> 02:19:11.977
You must leave by the same gate we entered.

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:15.605
Right.

02:19:21.812 --> 02:19:23.655
- He's unconscious!
- Of course.

02:19:23.814 --> 02:19:26.111
- You told me he might be weak...
- Didn't you notice?

02:19:26.316 --> 02:19:28.943
I was weak and faint when I arrived here,

02:19:29.111 --> 02:19:30.831
and I am fainter now that you bring me out.

02:19:30.946 --> 02:19:33.745
In fact, I am overcome. Now hurry, man!

02:19:44.126 --> 02:19:46.379
Guards!

02:19:46.545 --> 02:19:48.462
You swear not to betray me?

02:19:48.463 --> 02:19:52.343
I've come this far, I will not stop now.

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.893
Here he is, the fool.

02:19:57.055 --> 02:19:58.895
He should know better than to visit a prisoner

02:19:59.016 --> 02:20:01.735
if he can't bear up upon seeing him.

02:20:20.495 --> 02:20:22.839
- Are you ready, Miss Pross?
- Yes.

02:20:22.998 --> 02:20:24.341
How is Dr. Manette?

02:20:24.499 --> 02:20:25.716
He's all right now.

02:20:25.876 --> 02:20:27.378
He understands what's happening.

02:20:27.544 --> 02:20:29.064
- I think you better fetch them.
- Yes.

02:20:31.089 --> 02:20:34.844
We won't be moving very quickly, sir,
if we all take this one coach.

02:20:35.010 --> 02:20:38.059
Hmm. What do you suggest?

02:20:38.221 --> 02:20:40.019
Me and Miss Pross, we'll hire another coach,

02:20:40.182 --> 02:20:41.775
catch up with you later at the coast.

02:20:41.934 --> 02:20:43.652
Yes. Have you got your papers?

02:20:43.810 --> 02:20:44.857
We've got everything we'll need.

02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:47.523
- They won't be wanting us anyway.
- Hm.

02:20:49.024 --> 02:20:50.867
I think it's time we told them.

02:20:51.026 --> 02:20:53.245
No need. They'll find out for themselves.

02:20:55.656 --> 02:20:56.873
Where is Mr. Carton?

02:20:57.032 --> 02:20:59.376
In the coach. Come, Doctor.

02:21:08.043 --> 02:21:11.587
Dear God, do we have to leave now? I can't bear it!

02:21:11.588 --> 02:21:13.386
Please, my dear, in the coach.

02:21:13.548 --> 02:21:15.016
Quick!

02:21:16.718 --> 02:21:17.970
Charles!

02:21:18.136 --> 02:21:19.183
Yes, it's Charles.

02:21:19.346 --> 02:21:21.474
He's all right, he's just drugged.

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:25.439
If you please, Doctor, we must leave at once.

02:21:25.602 --> 02:21:27.696
There's no time to lose. Come on, quickly.

02:21:27.854 --> 02:21:29.777
Help the child, Jerry.

02:22:05.934 --> 02:22:08.904
- Your papers.
- Here you are.

02:22:14.609 --> 02:22:16.486
Is he sick?

02:22:16.653 --> 02:22:18.781
Asleep.

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:27.964
Thank you.

02:22:32.169 --> 02:22:33.887
Move on.

02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:42.887
What do I care, eh?

02:22:42.888 --> 02:22:45.983
What do I care for this Dr. Manette?

02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:51.318
And I tell you, his daughter, she is now an Evremonde.

02:22:51.521 --> 02:22:53.364
And she will be the next to die.

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.653
She has a fine head for it.

02:22:57.819 --> 02:23:00.072
Brown eyes and golden hair.

02:23:00.238 --> 02:23:04.334
I cannot trust my husband in this. I must act for myself.

02:23:05.619 --> 02:23:07.747
I must act for myself, and quickly.

02:23:07.913 --> 02:23:09.836
- Where do you go?
- To her, to the Manette's.

02:23:09.998 --> 02:23:12.592
She will be there, waiting for her husband's death.

02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:13.968
Ready to impeach anyone,

02:23:14.127 --> 02:23:16.971
full of sympathy for the enemies of the Republic.

02:23:17.130 --> 02:23:19.758
I shall then report every word she says.

02:23:19.925 --> 02:23:21.427
Wonderful. Marvelous.

02:23:21.635 --> 02:23:22.761
Here, take this.

02:23:22.928 --> 02:23:24.851
Have it at the guillotine for me this afternoon.

02:23:25.013 --> 02:23:26.936
I shall take my usual place.

02:23:27.099 --> 02:23:28.942
He dies today.

02:23:29.101 --> 02:23:31.274
Be certain you are there.

02:23:32.395 --> 02:23:34.818
Do you think I would miss it?

02:23:40.237 --> 02:23:43.741
I'll leave you now, Miss Pross, and fetch the coach.

02:23:43.907 --> 02:23:46.751
I'll be ready when you return.

02:23:55.627 --> 02:23:57.254
Oh!

02:24:01.591 --> 02:24:04.219
I wish to speak to the wife of Evremonde.

02:24:04.386 --> 02:24:05.433
Where is she?

02:24:05.637 --> 02:24:06.980
She...

02:24:07.139 --> 02:24:10.734
She is resting now, and she can't be disturbed.

02:24:10.892 --> 02:24:12.143
I would see her.

02:24:12.144 --> 02:24:14.363
And I say you will not disturb her.

02:24:14.521 --> 02:24:16.615
Out of my way.

02:24:16.773 --> 02:24:17.899
Madame.

02:24:18.066 --> 02:24:20.237
You might be the wife of the Devil himself,

02:24:20.238 --> 02:24:22.112
but you will not get the best of me.

02:24:22.279 --> 02:24:23.872
I am an Englishwoman.

02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:27.034
We have no quarrel. I have come to pay my respects.

02:24:27.035 --> 02:24:30.458
You have come here, Madame,
because your intentions are evil.

02:24:30.662 --> 02:24:33.381
And you may depend I shall hold my own against them.

02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:36.259
You will tell her that I wish to see her.

02:24:36.418 --> 02:24:39.342
I will not, you wicked foreign woman.

02:24:39.504 --> 02:24:40.756
I am your match.

02:24:40.922 --> 02:24:45.678
Imbecile. I will not take answers from you.

02:24:45.844 --> 02:24:46.845
Get out of my way.

02:24:47.012 --> 02:24:49.606
You will not have a handful of that dark hair left

02:24:49.764 --> 02:24:51.232
if you put a finger on me.

02:24:53.226 --> 02:24:56.228
Wife of Evremonde!

02:24:56.229 --> 02:24:58.948
Answer me!

02:25:01.067 --> 02:25:02.319
If she is gone from here,

02:25:02.485 --> 02:25:04.125
I can have her followed and brought back.

02:25:04.237 --> 02:25:05.454
I can have her pursued.

02:25:05.455 --> 02:25:06.915
They are not gone.

02:25:07.073 --> 02:25:09.246
She's resting within and shall remain there.

02:25:10.076 --> 02:25:11.919
Listen to me, woman.

02:25:12.078 --> 02:25:14.206
I have killed men with knife and pistol,

02:25:14.372 --> 02:25:17.296
and I shall tear you to pieces
if you do not get out of the way.

02:25:17.459 --> 02:25:18.881
Try it, Madame.

02:25:19.044 --> 02:25:21.547
I am an Englishwoman. Try it.

02:25:45.904 --> 02:25:48.748
Miss Pross! Miss Pross!

02:25:48.907 --> 02:25:51.285
I've brought the coach!

02:26:02.295 --> 02:26:04.093
Got everything?

02:26:04.256 --> 02:26:07.180
- I'd best go in and check.
- No.

02:26:07.342 --> 02:26:09.811
Are you all right, Miss Pross?

02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:11.688
I feel...

02:26:11.846 --> 02:26:15.099
I feel as though there had been a crash.

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:18.980
And now, a stillness.

02:26:19.145 --> 02:26:22.194
A stillness for the rest of my life.

02:26:56.558 --> 02:26:58.310
Outside!

02:26:58.476 --> 02:27:01.400
Move! Keep moving! Come on!

02:27:01.563 --> 02:27:03.406
Fall in, you men.

02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:05.157
Move along.

02:27:10.697 --> 02:27:12.495
Come on.

02:27:25.795 --> 02:27:27.422
Hang there!

02:27:31.176 --> 02:27:32.598
I've done nothing.

02:27:34.262 --> 02:27:36.390
I'm a seamstress.

02:27:38.433 --> 02:27:40.811
It's not that I am afraid to die, but...

02:27:40.977 --> 02:27:42.354
I don't know why.

02:27:43.897 --> 02:27:45.695
Yes, I know.

02:27:47.233 --> 02:27:51.488
Monsieur, would you ride with me in the tumbril?

02:27:51.654 --> 02:27:54.248
- Would you hold my hand?
- Move it!

02:27:56.659 --> 02:27:59.287
Yes, of course.

02:28:00.872 --> 02:28:03.091
I am only a little weak.

02:28:03.249 --> 02:28:05.468
It will give me courage.

02:28:06.336 --> 02:28:08.930
I would be proud to hold your hand.

02:28:16.012 --> 02:28:17.685
Come on!

02:28:27.357 --> 02:28:29.701
Forward... march!

02:28:33.196 --> 02:28:35.699
Traitors! Murderers!

02:31:35.712 --> 02:31:38.431
Keep your eyes upon me and nothing else.

02:32:06.701 --> 02:32:11.081
"If you remember the words
that passed between us long ago,"

02:32:11.247 --> 02:32:15.167
you will readily comprehend this when you see it.

02:32:15.168 --> 02:32:20.550
I am thankful that the time has come
when I can prove those words.

02:32:20.715 --> 02:32:27.189
"That I do so is no subject for regret or grief."

02:32:53.081 --> 02:32:54.674
- Have you seen her?
- Who?

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:56.675
- Therese Defarge.
- No!

02:32:56.834 --> 02:33:00.555
She's never late. Today especially.

02:33:58.521 --> 02:34:00.819
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

02:34:01.441 --> 02:34:05.867
Kill him! Kill him! Yes!

02:34:08.948 --> 02:34:12.168
It is a far, far better thing that I do

02:34:12.326 --> 02:34:14.579
than I have ever done.

02:34:14.746 --> 02:34:19.422
It is a far, far better rest that I go to

02:34:19.584 --> 02:34:21.757
than I have ever known.
