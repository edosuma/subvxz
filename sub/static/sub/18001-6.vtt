WEBVTT

00:07.165 --> 00:08.470
You know what I got to get in here?

00:08.504 --> 00:09.641
- What's that?
- A gong.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.811
- A gong for what?
- Remember

00:10.845 --> 00:12.014
<i>that TV show, the gong show?</i>

00:12.048 --> 00:13.515
Yeah, I remember that.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.993
When I hear a bad idea or a stupid topic...

00:17.028 --> 00:18.463
Gong.

00:18.498 --> 00:21.036
Within a week Mike's at the ear doctor.

00:21.070 --> 00:23.711
[All laughing]

00:23.745 --> 00:25.687
Let's say it's not just at work.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.159
Let's say it's at home, too.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.261
Are you telling me you don't think you

00:28.296 --> 00:30.037
would ever get gonged at home?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.510
Some of the ideas you proud
that you talk about here?

00:31.544 --> 00:33.120
Oh, I thought you meant
certain performances.

00:33.154 --> 00:36.792
- And performances.
- [All laughing]

00:36.826 --> 00:38.597
Well, I mean, yeah.

00:38.632 --> 00:41.268
I'm pretty good but I
can't be 100% all the time.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.805
[All laughing]

00:43.840 --> 00:46.914

01:19.227 --> 01:21.695
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:21.730 --> 01:25.037
the only show that finds a
clown way scarier than a bat.

01:25.071 --> 01:26.237
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:26.271 --> 01:28.072
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:28.106 --> 01:29.774
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:29.808 --> 01:31.575
Now you know I don't care
if you ever make money

01:31.610 --> 01:33.609
in this store, but I do care
that you have stories to tell.

01:33.644 --> 01:35.077
So what happened this week?

01:35.110 --> 01:37.112
Something pretty cool came into the stash.

01:42.492 --> 01:43.893
- Guys.
- Hey, how you doing?

01:43.927 --> 01:45.861
- Good. How are you?
- Ooh, what is that?

01:45.895 --> 01:48.699
<i>I have a set of Star Wars</i>

01:48.733 --> 01:52.136
newspaper comic reprints
drawn by Al Williamson.

01:52.171 --> 01:53.337
They're autographed.

01:53.372 --> 01:54.605
They are limited edition.

01:54.639 --> 01:56.108
There was, like, 25,000 printed.

01:56.142 --> 01:57.709
This is number 1,735.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.878
Ooh, this is rare, man.
I've heard of these.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.414
I've actually never seen this, though.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.627
Do you mind if I pop it open,

02:11.661 --> 02:13.865
take a look and see at one of the volumes?

02:13.899 --> 02:15.399
- Oh, by all means. Go right ahead. Mm
- Hmm.

02:15.433 --> 02:16.867
These are from the actual '70s, right?

02:16.902 --> 02:18.504
- Right.
- These strips?

02:18.538 --> 02:19.506
<i>Like, at the height of Star Wars mania?</i>

02:19.540 --> 02:21.208
Oh, yeah, '70s, '80s.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.311
To just take you right
back to you're 12 years old.

02:23.345 --> 02:24.713
You got the newspaper out.

02:24.747 --> 02:27.153
Look, I mean, some days
it was just two panels.

02:27.188 --> 02:31.059
That's where our generation
learned the virtues of waiting.

02:31.093 --> 02:34.431
Now it's all, like,
instant gratification, man.

02:34.465 --> 02:37.335
We're better than everybody. We really are.

02:37.369 --> 02:40.707
<i>Oh, I loved these Star Wars comic strips.</i>

02:40.742 --> 02:43.177
It was a destination in childhood.

02:43.211 --> 02:45.012
Like, in the boring ass newspaper,

02:45.046 --> 02:47.717
full of words that had no meaning to a kid.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.019
Suddenly you would turn this magical page

02:50.053 --> 02:51.754
and suddenly it was like,
"that's... that's for me!

02:51.788 --> 02:53.522
That's for me! There are drawings!"

02:53.556 --> 02:55.724
<i>And when I was a kid, I
was such a Star Wars fan.</i>

02:55.759 --> 02:57.527
I'd cut 'em out and
put 'em in a photo album

02:57.561 --> 02:59.798
one under the other so you could
sit there and read the story.

02:59.832 --> 03:01.268
Oh, that's sweet.

03:01.302 --> 03:03.235
<i>I used to cut out the family circus.</i>

03:03.270 --> 03:06.206
- And then I'd burn it.
- [All laughing]

03:06.240 --> 03:10.447
I know today's youth can't
understand how important buying

03:10.482 --> 03:14.116
the daily newspaper was,
just to read those funnies.

03:14.151 --> 03:16.054
I lived and died for the Sunday paper.

03:16.088 --> 03:18.324
So did I. Did you read the
Sundays as a young girl?

03:18.359 --> 03:20.993
I still read the newspaper
comics on Sundays.

03:21.028 --> 03:21.993
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.063
Favorite strip?

03:24.097 --> 03:26.634
<i>As a child, snoopy.</i>

03:26.668 --> 03:27.902
<i>And I liked Heathcliff too.</i>

03:27.936 --> 03:29.670
<i>- Heathcliff?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

03:29.704 --> 03:32.173
<i>Both: The poor man's garfield.</i>

03:32.207 --> 03:33.741
<i>Heathcliff?</i>

03:33.776 --> 03:37.913
He was cute and he
was... I love cats, so...

03:37.947 --> 03:40.148
So why are you looking to sell it?

03:40.183 --> 03:43.118
Well, I'm going to be moving
in with my boyfriend soon,

03:43.153 --> 03:44.687
me and my daughter,

03:44.721 --> 03:48.591
and I could really use the
money to help fix up her room.

03:48.625 --> 03:51.094
I'll miss it, but my girl's more important.

03:51.128 --> 03:52.365
All right.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.099
What are you looking to get for it?

03:54.134 --> 03:58.168
I was hoping around $500.

03:58.202 --> 03:59.671
Hmm.

03:59.705 --> 04:02.777
The slipcase does show
some signs of its age.

04:02.811 --> 04:04.612
I mean, it is over 20 years old,

04:04.646 --> 04:06.780
so got to take that into consideration.

04:06.815 --> 04:08.617
I don't think I could do $500.

04:08.651 --> 04:09.785
Okay.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.187
How 'bout $225?

04:11.221 --> 04:14.023
I was really hoping for more.

04:14.057 --> 04:19.291
Could you maybe stretch it up to $250?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.192
All right.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.730
- I'll do $250.
- Okay.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.566
Okay. $250 it is.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.000
All right, thank you so much.

04:27.035 --> 04:28.101
Thank you! Have a great day, gentlemen.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.498
- All right. Good luck.
- Bye.

04:30.532 --> 04:32.065
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.410
- How you doing?
- Hey guys, how you doing?

04:39.444 --> 04:41.246
Obviously you're Batman fans, right?

04:41.280 --> 04:42.614
- Yeah.
- A little bit.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.617
I got a piece of '66 Batman history

04:44.651 --> 04:45.919
you guys might be interested in.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.455
Yeah, sure. What is it?

04:47.490 --> 04:49.557
Actually kind of heavy
for me to bring in, guys.

04:49.592 --> 04:51.761
- Can you step outside?
- It's too heavy to bring in?

04:51.795 --> 04:52.929
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:52.963 --> 04:54.797
- All right.
- I'm intrigued.

04:54.832 --> 04:55.798
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right, let's go.

04:55.832 --> 04:58.032
Lead the way.

04:58.066 --> 05:00.496
All right, so let's see
this piece of history.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.030
All right, come on over.

05:02.064 --> 05:04.364
This is it?

05:04.398 --> 05:06.431
- You guys ready for this?
- Yeah.

05:06.466 --> 05:07.398
It's a one of a kind item.

05:11.239 --> 05:13.141
- Oh, no way!
- Place went out of business,

05:13.176 --> 05:14.944
and I guess somehow this one survived.

05:14.978 --> 05:16.544
This is probably the only
time you're gonna get a chance

05:16.578 --> 05:18.312
to get something like this.

05:18.346 --> 05:19.547
What the Heck is this?

05:19.581 --> 05:21.116
This is a Ming puppet, man.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.017
Just like Ming, it just
wants to be a real boy.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.968
So let's see this piece of history.

05:33.002 --> 05:36.639
- All right. Come on over.
- This is it?

05:37.943 --> 05:39.084
You guys ready for this?

05:39.084 --> 05:41.823
- Yeah.
- It's a one of a kind item.

05:44.846 --> 05:46.681
- Oh!
- Oh, no way!

05:46.716 --> 05:48.249
A piece of sidewalk!

05:58.043 --> 05:59.841
This is one of those plaster casters

05:59.876 --> 06:01.071
from those Chinese theaters, right?

06:01.071 --> 06:02.326
Yeah. Something like that, yeah.

06:02.326 --> 06:04.793
This is the original Adam
west/burt ward handprint,

06:04.826 --> 06:06.292
footprint, and autograph.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.926
Here's actually a photo
of it taken to prove it

06:08.960 --> 06:10.660
back from 1981.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.660
You lifted this from
Mano's theater in Hollywood?

06:12.695 --> 06:14.593
No, actually. It came
from Orlando, Florida.

06:14.627 --> 06:15.995
Stars hall of fame.

06:16.029 --> 06:17.631
It was a wax museum, and their handprints

06:17.665 --> 06:19.267
and footprints lined the sidewalk.

06:19.301 --> 06:20.567
The place went out of business

06:20.602 --> 06:22.333
and I guess they junked everything.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.266
And somehow this one
survived. And I picked it up

06:24.301 --> 06:26.668
from a buddy of mine
that's a memorabilia dealer.

06:26.702 --> 06:28.770
How'd they go out of
business, slip and fall?

06:28.804 --> 06:30.406
I mean, jeez...

06:30.918 --> 06:33.050
I envisioned maybe we'd chisel out

06:33.084 --> 06:34.319
the front of the store,

06:34.353 --> 06:36.452
and we'd lay this block in there.

06:36.486 --> 06:39.120
Maybe we start a little theme
down broad street, you know?

06:39.155 --> 06:42.057
All the way down broad
street we'll have celebrities.

06:42.092 --> 06:44.491
And one day a child will be
like, "when did this start?"

06:44.526 --> 06:45.893
And that child will be told,

06:45.928 --> 06:47.397
"when somebody threw this out

06:47.432 --> 06:49.131
and then it was bought
by the secret stash."

06:49.166 --> 06:51.099
Didn't seem to work for
stars hall of fame...

06:51.133 --> 06:52.301
what chance do you have?

06:52.336 --> 06:54.405
Might be weird for some people.

06:54.439 --> 06:55.772
Like, "were they ever
here?" We're like, "no,

06:55.806 --> 06:57.972
- but they were in Orlando!"
- [All laughing]

06:58.007 --> 07:00.842
"Three decades ago."

07:00.876 --> 07:03.744
Wow. That's absolutely insane, man.

07:03.779 --> 07:05.647
I mean, this has got
to be, without a doubt,

07:05.682 --> 07:07.283
the most unique piece

07:07.317 --> 07:08.783
that's ever been brought down to the stash.

07:08.817 --> 07:10.183
Oh, easily.

07:10.217 --> 07:12.415
Do you mind we, uh, size our hands up?

07:12.449 --> 07:14.315
Go 'head. Help yourself.

07:18.287 --> 07:21.256
- It's like, go on.
- [Laughter]

07:21.290 --> 07:22.457
It's like pulling Excalibur

07:22.491 --> 07:24.593
- out of the stone.
- Not quite.

07:24.627 --> 07:27.029
Do you know how many
birds have crapped on that

07:27.063 --> 07:29.632
since he did that, and you're
acting like it's an honor?

07:29.666 --> 07:32.367
I mean, I have to. [Mutters]

07:32.401 --> 07:34.302
[Laughter]

07:34.337 --> 07:36.770
- That's pretty close.
- It's close, but no cigar.

07:36.804 --> 07:41.607
- I think I might be more Robin.
- Come on, old chum!

07:41.641 --> 07:43.042
I can't imagine you're selling this.

07:43.076 --> 07:44.377
- Yeah.
- Really?

07:44.411 --> 07:45.978
Yeah, I'm gonna part with it.

07:46.013 --> 07:47.982
I got a whole room dedicated
in the house to Batman.

07:48.017 --> 07:51.022
Costumes, autographs,
comic books... everything.

07:51.056 --> 07:53.321
- I have a '66 Batmobile I built.
- Really?

07:53.355 --> 07:57.025
Yeah. And I'm in the middle
of making a '66 Batboat now,

07:57.059 --> 07:58.893
so I was gonna pick up a little extra cash.

07:58.928 --> 08:00.228
Wow.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.696
So what, do you have a Batcave too?

08:01.730 --> 08:03.131
Yeah, I got a problem.

08:03.165 --> 08:04.399
- I do have a Batman problem.
- Oh, all right.

08:04.433 --> 08:06.533
Bats in the belfry, as they say.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.402
I mean, I want it, man.
I definitely want it.

08:09.437 --> 08:11.371
I think it would look awesome right there.

08:11.405 --> 08:13.837
- People walk in, you know.
- Fall. Sue you.

08:13.871 --> 08:17.177
[All laughing]

08:17.211 --> 08:20.183
So what are you looking to get for it?

08:20.217 --> 08:21.484
I'm looking to get $1,500.

08:21.519 --> 08:23.420
$1,500. Wow.

08:23.455 --> 08:25.189
One of a kind, though.

08:25.223 --> 08:26.557
There's not another one and
you couldn't get these guys

08:26.591 --> 08:29.729
to do this now for under $1,000.

08:29.764 --> 08:31.031
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:31.066 --> 08:32.200
I mean, this is probably the only time

08:32.234 --> 08:33.599
you're gonna get a chance to ever

08:33.633 --> 08:35.099
- get something like this.
- Yeah.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.601
The next time they're
stepping into concrete,

08:36.635 --> 08:40.404
- it's for good.
- [All laughing]

08:40.438 --> 08:42.674
Would you take $700 for it?

08:42.708 --> 08:44.512
Um...

08:44.546 --> 08:46.080
I almost paid that much for it.

08:46.115 --> 08:50.952
All right, well, how about $800 then?

08:50.986 --> 08:52.586
Can you do $1,200?

08:52.620 --> 08:55.223
Uh...

08:55.258 --> 08:58.328
I think $800 is as high
as I can go, I mean...

08:58.362 --> 09:00.930
- that's the best you can do?
- $800.

09:00.965 --> 09:02.867
The best I could do is definitely $800,

09:02.901 --> 09:04.304
but no higher than that.

09:04.338 --> 09:06.240
Tempting, but... Nah.

09:06.275 --> 09:09.241
All right. I understand. I
mean, it's a sweet piece, man.

09:09.276 --> 09:10.643
It's awesome. Thanks for
bringing it in, though.

09:10.677 --> 09:11.744
I appreciate it. Thanks for your time.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.113
- All right.
- Thanks, guys.

09:13.147 --> 09:14.112
- Yep, take it easy.
- Have a good one.

09:14.146 --> 09:15.145
All right.

09:24.353 --> 09:25.920
Let's say doctor doom,

09:25.954 --> 09:27.322
he chooses red bank

09:27.356 --> 09:32.091
as his next destination
to conquer and rule.

09:32.126 --> 09:34.559
What do you do... you stay and fight...

09:34.593 --> 09:37.263
Or you run away?

09:37.296 --> 09:38.996
Well, what does he do? Does he have powers?

09:39.031 --> 09:40.329
Well, he's kind of a tyrant.

09:40.364 --> 09:42.264
He rules his land with an iron fist,

09:42.299 --> 09:46.301
but he assumes that all his
subjects are happy, so...

09:46.335 --> 09:48.069
He doesn't just assume.

09:48.104 --> 09:49.674
It's a law that they have to be happy.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.907
Okay. Well, I'm not gonna move there.

09:52.942 --> 09:54.308
I want to say I want to fight,

09:54.342 --> 09:56.977
but, like, what can I
do against doctor doom?

09:57.012 --> 09:58.279
Everybody's counting on you, Ming.

09:58.313 --> 09:59.447
- Yeah.
- It's you versus him.

09:59.481 --> 10:00.982
You guys are counting on me

10:01.016 --> 10:03.420
for the store to survive,
for our way of life?

10:03.454 --> 10:04.855
- Red bank.
- I'm not counting on you.

10:04.889 --> 10:06.959
- I'm like, "heil, doom."
- [All laughing]

10:06.993 --> 10:09.230
I'm like,

10:09.265 --> 10:11.199
- "whatever you say, doom."
- See this smile?

10:11.234 --> 10:12.768
[All laughing]

10:15.040 --> 10:16.208
What the Heck is this?

10:16.242 --> 10:17.474
This is a Ming puppet, man.

10:17.508 --> 10:20.846
- Built to scale, too!
- In every way.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.479
I have a big toy that
I'm interested in selling.

10:22.514 --> 10:24.548
It's about this big and this high.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.416
- Think you can handle it?
- This is the secret stash, son.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.784
We can handle any size toy.

10:29.443 --> 10:31.043
Any time you go to a movie theater now,

10:31.078 --> 10:33.345
there's a comic book
adaptation on the big screen,

10:33.379 --> 10:36.716
<i>so eventually it's gonna
come down to Comic Book Men:</i>

10:36.750 --> 10:39.185
<i>The movie. Who plays who?</i>

10:39.219 --> 10:40.749
I'm gonna be played by John Hamm.

10:40.784 --> 10:42.885
That's what I'm voting for.

10:42.919 --> 10:44.553
If they're gonna make a movie of this,

10:44.588 --> 10:46.620
I want to see a fictionalized
version of Kevin Smith

10:46.655 --> 10:48.054
in the right physique.

10:48.088 --> 10:49.724
What about you, Ming? Who would play you

10:49.758 --> 10:51.292
<i>in the Comic Book Men: The movie?</i>

10:51.326 --> 10:53.725
Oh, man. I mean, the
arrogant me says Bruce Lee.

10:53.759 --> 10:56.428
The less arrogant me says jet li.

10:56.462 --> 10:59.464
- What?
- They're both arrogant!

10:59.499 --> 11:01.601
- Zap, what you got?
- Robert Downey Jr.

11:01.636 --> 11:03.904
Oh, excellent choice, man!

11:03.938 --> 11:05.272
You're already there.

11:05.306 --> 11:07.440
You definitely evoke Robert Downey Jr.

11:07.475 --> 11:08.975
- I'm hoping.
- What about you, big?

11:09.010 --> 11:11.044
- Phillip Mckeon.
- That kid on the show

11:11.078 --> 11:13.080
<i>who played Tommy on Alice?</i>

11:13.114 --> 11:16.118
The teenage version of Tommy
did look like you in high school.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.819
When I was in high school,
three times somebody

11:17.853 --> 11:19.453
came up to me in the mall
and were like, "are...

11:19.487 --> 11:22.387
are you... are you on
TV?" And I said, "no."

11:22.422 --> 11:24.289
- Years later...
- Yeah, I'm like, "hey, guys!

11:24.323 --> 11:26.290
I'm on TV!" They're like,
"get away from that man!"

11:26.290 --> 11:27.292
[All laughing]

11:38.098 --> 11:39.665
Hey. Would one of you guys

11:39.699 --> 11:41.142
be willing to write my eulogy?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.270
Why on earth would that come up?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.407
- I want it to be funny.
- I want it to be uplifting.

11:46.441 --> 11:47.876
Who better to do it than you?

11:47.910 --> 11:49.077
Or you, or you?

11:49.111 --> 11:50.711
I feel bad that, like, after,

11:50.746 --> 11:52.546
like, I deliver the eulogy,

11:52.580 --> 11:54.781
a day or two later your family
comes and asks me, like, "hey,

11:54.816 --> 11:55.916
how'd it go, anyway?"

11:55.950 --> 12:00.123
[All laughing]

12:00.157 --> 12:01.292
I know it'd probably make you

12:01.327 --> 12:02.930
really uncomfortable being

12:02.965 --> 12:04.565
in front of that many
people delivering my eulogy,

12:04.599 --> 12:06.501
but, I mean, at least you'd give it a shot.

12:06.535 --> 12:09.171
I'd definitely give it a shot but, man...

12:09.205 --> 12:10.640
Talk about a challenge.

12:10.674 --> 12:12.776
Talk about mission: Impossible, you know?

12:12.811 --> 12:14.279
Talk about the assumption he'd be doing it

12:14.313 --> 12:15.416
in front of a lot of people.

12:15.451 --> 12:21.454
[All laughing]

12:23.690 --> 12:25.324
Not funny.

12:25.358 --> 12:29.293
- That's really not funny.
- Ming!

12:29.328 --> 12:30.795
What the Heck is this?

12:30.830 --> 12:31.898
Is that supposed to be me?

12:31.932 --> 12:33.334
It's supposed to be you.

12:33.369 --> 12:34.734
It literally has your face on it, Ming.

12:34.768 --> 12:36.369
I mean... Yeah.

12:36.404 --> 12:38.472
Oh, it is your face. This
is a Ming puppet, man.

12:38.506 --> 12:41.974
- Yeah, I see that.
- Oh, and built to scale, too!

12:42.009 --> 12:45.312
- You got it.
- In every way.

12:45.346 --> 12:47.646
- What? Really?
- It was a Ming puppet.

12:47.681 --> 12:50.184
Or more accurately, I
guess it was a marionette.

12:50.218 --> 12:51.887
It was, you know, like, the strings and...

12:51.922 --> 12:53.822
Or even more accurately, a sex doll.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.989
[All laughing]

12:56.023 --> 12:57.923
Oh, boy. I'm telling you right now.

12:57.958 --> 13:00.059
I would love to have real strings attached

13:00.094 --> 13:01.762
- to your real limbs, man.
- You pretty much do!

13:01.796 --> 13:02.930
You tell me what to do in the store!

13:02.964 --> 13:05.265
What are we talking about?

13:05.300 --> 13:07.101
Look at the face, man! It's so perfect.

13:07.135 --> 13:09.303
- Look at those dead eyes.
- Dead eyes.

13:09.337 --> 13:11.539
Look at that vacant stare.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.173
Holy Christ!

13:13.208 --> 13:14.708
You're right. It's like Pinocchio.

13:14.742 --> 13:15.776
It's just like Ming, it just wants to be

13:15.810 --> 13:19.618
- a real boy.
- [All laughing]

13:19.652 --> 13:22.356
- All right, well done.
- Thanks so much.

13:22.390 --> 13:24.926
Yeah. I'm impressed.

13:24.961 --> 13:26.462
I'm so glad you brought this down.

13:26.497 --> 13:27.462
Yeah, where'd you come from?

13:27.496 --> 13:28.862
- Dallas... Yes.
- Texas?

13:28.896 --> 13:30.364
So that's why you're here today?

13:30.399 --> 13:31.902
You're just here to deliver the puppet?

13:31.970 --> 13:33.440
<i>Actually, I'm looking for the tick.</i>

13:33.474 --> 13:34.908
<i>The comic book character the tick?</i>

13:34.943 --> 13:37.277
The action figures. From the 1995 line.

13:37.311 --> 13:39.679
We actually do have some '90s tick toys.

13:39.714 --> 13:41.081
- You want to go grab 'em?
- Yeah.

13:41.115 --> 13:42.915
- Where are they, the basement?
- Yep.

13:50.825 --> 13:52.026
Here you go.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.027
- Oh, dude!
- All right, huh?

13:53.061 --> 13:55.297
We got the original tick.

13:55.331 --> 13:58.267
We got a very hard to find die...

13:58.301 --> 14:00.870
- Fledermaus. 
- And we got a man-eating cow.

14:00.905 --> 14:04.138
Now, this figure at one point
was fetching triple figures.

14:04.173 --> 14:07.244
Are they figures you
need for your collection?

14:07.278 --> 14:09.278
Yes, they are.

14:09.312 --> 14:11.080
<i>The tick comics...
really, like what they did</i>

14:11.115 --> 14:13.484
is they sent up comic book characters

14:13.519 --> 14:15.787
and superheroes in a
particularly funny way...

14:15.822 --> 14:17.390
biting sense of humor.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.090
But it was kind of a mock of comic books

14:20.124 --> 14:21.323
to a large degree.

14:21.358 --> 14:22.790
- A spoof.
- Spoof, if you will.

14:22.824 --> 14:24.224
Loving spoof.

14:24.258 --> 14:26.393
They had characters like Die Fledermaus

14:26.428 --> 14:28.429
but didn't they change his name

14:28.463 --> 14:30.662
'cause it was too close to Batman?

14:30.696 --> 14:32.896
It's the German translation of "the bat."

14:32.931 --> 14:34.132
Die Fledermaus.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.935
He was an interesting character

14:35.970 --> 14:38.740
because when they translated
him to the live-action TV show,

14:38.775 --> 14:41.044
they had to change his name
because of copyright issues.

14:41.078 --> 14:42.811
Which is kind of funny, 'cause

14:42.846 --> 14:46.383
Die Fledermaus, DC Comics
actually sued new England comics

14:46.418 --> 14:48.221
because he was too much like Batman,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.155
but they changed the name to Batmanuel.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.160
- Which is more like Batman.
- Exactly.

14:52.194 --> 14:55.465
All right, now let's talk
about some serious brass tacks.

14:55.499 --> 14:57.436
- Brass tacks?
- Moola.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.975
Oh, I thought you were
gonna talk about the fedora.

15:00.009 --> 15:02.377
[Laughter] I was wrong.

15:02.412 --> 15:05.047
We're looking to get $20 for the tick.

15:05.081 --> 15:08.051
Now, this figure at one point
was fetching triple figures.

15:08.086 --> 15:09.753
You know, it's kind of
gotta soft, the market,

15:09.788 --> 15:12.258
a little bit now. We're
trying to get $35 for it.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.567
And Die Fledermaus,

15:14.601 --> 15:16.236
- trying to get $35.
- Yeah.

15:16.270 --> 15:19.912
But I would take the puppet
for the three figures.

15:19.946 --> 15:20.947
Get out of town.

15:20.981 --> 15:22.649
- What do you say?
- Sure.

15:22.683 --> 15:24.117
Awesome.

15:24.151 --> 15:26.553
You just got yourself three tick figures.

15:26.587 --> 15:28.922
- Why, thank you, kind sir.
- And the stash just acquired...

15:28.956 --> 15:30.458
Something almost as useless.

15:30.492 --> 15:33.663
[Laughing]

15:33.697 --> 15:34.763
All right, thanks, brother!

15:34.798 --> 15:36.398
- Thank you.
- All right.

15:36.433 --> 15:37.935
We will give it a good home. I promise you.

15:37.969 --> 15:39.803
- Thanks.
- Take care.

15:39.837 --> 15:41.804
That's what they said to my
parents when I was adopted.

15:41.838 --> 15:43.138
[Laughing]

15:44.806 --> 15:46.339
<i>- What is that?
- It's the G.I. Joe defiant.</i>

15:46.374 --> 15:47.809
You're not seeing it in its full glory.

15:47.844 --> 15:49.480
- Look at it!
- Toys today do not

15:49.515 --> 15:51.183
match this level of detail.

15:58.572 --> 16:00.608
- You know who I feel bad for?
- Who?

16:00.642 --> 16:02.776
- Invisible superheroes.
- Why?

16:02.810 --> 16:04.444
I mean, I know that, like,

16:04.479 --> 16:07.215
a superhero's supposed to
be all about selfless acts,

16:07.249 --> 16:09.749
but we all know deep down
inside no one wants to be

16:09.783 --> 16:11.383
the invisible superhero.

16:11.418 --> 16:13.253
Oh, so you're saying they want recognition?

16:13.287 --> 16:15.285
They want, you know,
the picture in the paper?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.254
No video, didn't happen?

16:17.289 --> 16:18.789
Yeah, yeah. No news footage?

16:18.823 --> 16:21.325
Yeah. You might have a point.

16:21.359 --> 16:24.861
Think about all you could do
if you were invisible, though.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.797
Oh, he's already been thinking about it.

16:26.831 --> 16:28.331
And just 'cause you're
invisible doesn't mean

16:28.366 --> 16:31.302
- they can't hear you panting.
- [All laughing]

16:31.336 --> 16:33.470
Well, hold on. If I'm invisible, do, like,

16:33.504 --> 16:35.103
the clothes I wear,
are they also invisible?

16:35.138 --> 16:36.837
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.705
If you're invisible,
you got to go au naturel

16:38.739 --> 16:40.438
or else they'll just see no head, no arms.

16:40.473 --> 16:42.272
You'd just be the staff
shirt walking around.

16:42.307 --> 16:46.443
Staff shirt and a thimble.

16:46.477 --> 16:48.379
Just in case he suddenly becomes visible.

16:48.413 --> 16:49.814
[All laughing]

16:55.090 --> 16:56.157
Hey, guys. How's it going?

16:56.191 --> 16:57.760
Hey, how you doing?

16:57.794 --> 16:59.530
I have a big toy that
I'm interested in selling.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.765
It's about this big and this high.

17:01.799 --> 17:04.001
- Think you can handle it?
- This is the secret stash, son.

17:04.036 --> 17:06.769
- We can handle any size toy.
- Sounds good to me.

17:06.804 --> 17:08.371
If you can give me a hand bringing it in,

17:08.405 --> 17:09.873
I'll bring it in, see what you guys think.

17:09.906 --> 17:11.174
You need a hand bringing this toy in, huh?

17:11.209 --> 17:12.407
Yeah. You got someone with muscles?

17:12.443 --> 17:14.575
Well, no, but... he'll do.

17:14.608 --> 17:16.345
- He's the best you can do.
- Come on.

17:16.380 --> 17:17.513
- I'll take what I can get.
- Let's go check it out.

17:17.548 --> 17:19.785
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.

17:19.819 --> 17:21.452
He wasn't kidding.

17:21.486 --> 17:23.385
<i>- What is that?
- It's the G.I. Joe defiant.</i>

17:23.419 --> 17:26.185
It looks like what I put
my recyclable in every week.

17:26.221 --> 17:27.621
You don't want to recycle this, trust me.

17:27.656 --> 17:29.390
No, don't put it up here, man.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.022
It's gonna get my counter all messed up.

17:31.056 --> 17:32.791
Bring that to the back.

17:32.825 --> 17:34.426
Poker table.

17:42.167 --> 17:43.969
Correct me if I'm wrong and
maybe I'm seeing this wrong,

17:44.003 --> 17:45.605
but it's not that big.

17:45.639 --> 17:47.408
Hold on, you're not seeing
it in its full glory.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.777
Like, you know, can we
open it up and then...

17:48.811 --> 17:50.111
yep, we can definitely launch a shuttle.

17:50.145 --> 17:51.910
Yeah. Are you ready for a launch?

17:51.944 --> 17:54.449
I'm ready for lunch, I
don't know about a launch.

17:54.484 --> 17:57.054
<i>- Doors open up...
- Space nuts joke right there.</i>

17:57.088 --> 17:58.554
Do I... can I crank this?

17:58.589 --> 18:00.392
Yep, you can... you can man the crank.

18:00.426 --> 18:01.494
Okay, right now? Ready?

18:01.529 --> 18:02.597
- Yeah, nice and slow.
- Okay.

18:02.631 --> 18:05.401
Oh, yeah. Crank it.

18:05.435 --> 18:07.835
- Yeah, all right.
- Right, man.

18:07.867 --> 18:10.432
Did you need three kids
to play with it every time

18:10.466 --> 18:13.734
- you wanted to, uh...
- Did you have three friends?

18:13.769 --> 18:17.668
He still doesn't have
three friends in here!

18:17.702 --> 18:19.171
They don't make toys like this anymore.

18:19.205 --> 18:20.641
They don't make toys that you

18:20.675 --> 18:23.782
need a small walk-in closet to play with.

18:23.816 --> 18:25.316
We're Americans.

18:25.350 --> 18:27.086
From birth we're told, "bigger is better!"

18:27.120 --> 18:28.255
And that's what we always pursue.

18:28.289 --> 18:30.157
I don't know about you guys,

18:30.191 --> 18:32.790
but the older I get, the less
I'm like, "I got to have it!"

18:32.825 --> 18:34.526
Like, I start looking around now,

18:34.560 --> 18:36.028
I'm like, "who's gonna
deal with all this crap

18:36.062 --> 18:37.661
when I'm gone?" You know, like,

18:37.696 --> 18:39.527
"this is gonna be
someone's garbage one day."

18:39.561 --> 18:41.892
[All laughing]

18:43.161 --> 18:44.327
- And then you...
- Can I open it up?

18:44.362 --> 18:46.331
- Yeah.
- Grab one door...

18:46.365 --> 18:48.101
Oh, you still got the figures here, too.

18:48.135 --> 18:49.837
<i>It's the figures. So when
you bought the defiant,</i>

18:49.871 --> 18:51.806
you got two exclusive figures, right?

18:51.842 --> 18:53.810
So these figures were
never available carded?

18:53.846 --> 18:55.514
Only with the purchase of this?

18:55.548 --> 18:57.081
You got payload here, all right?

18:57.115 --> 18:59.115
And payload's a trip.

18:59.150 --> 19:00.450
So here's the astronaut.

19:00.484 --> 19:01.785
Careful with the handles.

19:01.819 --> 19:03.421
And you're gonna lose the best part.

19:03.456 --> 19:05.489
Hardtop's microphone,
right? So he could talk.

19:05.524 --> 19:06.957
So it's the '80s, right?

19:06.992 --> 19:08.158
So you didn't have cell phones or anything.

19:08.192 --> 19:09.258
- Right.
- So this plugs in...

19:09.293 --> 19:11.127
And there it is.

19:11.161 --> 19:12.795
G.I. Joe for me was
always about the figures,

19:12.830 --> 19:14.530
not so much the vehicles, so the only way

19:14.564 --> 19:17.297
<i>to get hardtop and payload
was to buy the defiant.</i>

19:17.332 --> 19:19.035
This is why I love this stuff, though,

19:19.069 --> 19:20.938
like, even the toys today do
not match this level of detail.

19:20.972 --> 19:23.472
Yeah, somebody spent a lot of
time and energy to make this,

19:23.507 --> 19:25.606
you know, have all the
extra little features.

19:25.641 --> 19:27.340
So why are you bringing
it in today, though?

19:27.375 --> 19:30.109
So honestly, it takes up too
much space in my apartment,

19:30.143 --> 19:31.644
and I'm still in school

19:31.678 --> 19:33.111
and I've got a couple of moves ahead of me

19:33.146 --> 19:34.547
and I don't know if it's gonna survive.

19:34.581 --> 19:35.982
You're looking to sell it, basically?

19:36.016 --> 19:37.317
- Yes.
- All right, that's all right.

19:37.351 --> 19:39.155
- To a good home.
- To a good home.

19:39.190 --> 19:40.691
All right, so what are
you looking to get for it?

19:40.725 --> 19:42.826
I was thinking, like, 600 bucks.

19:42.860 --> 19:45.526
I mean, that'd probably be
out of running for the store.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.462
I was out of the running as
soon as he walked in with this.

19:47.497 --> 19:49.131
All right, so it comes down to me.

19:49.165 --> 19:50.465
Most likely, I would
think you're the only one

19:50.500 --> 19:51.734
who can appreciate this.

19:51.768 --> 19:53.203
I mean, I want it,

19:53.237 --> 19:54.771
but I don't because it's so big.

19:54.806 --> 19:56.307
Throw out a number. Let's see if you guys

19:56.341 --> 19:59.478
are in the same universe.

19:59.513 --> 20:00.946
Would you take 100 bucks for it?

20:00.981 --> 20:02.815
Nah. I couldn't let it go for that.

20:02.849 --> 20:04.617
For that offer, you can have this.

20:04.651 --> 20:06.721
Yeah, if you're looking
for a hardtop microphone.

20:06.756 --> 20:08.559
All right, there you go.

20:08.593 --> 20:11.060
I probably couldn't go
much higher for... for this.

20:11.094 --> 20:12.495
You're not gonna go much higher?

20:12.529 --> 20:14.165
- No.
- I don't think we're gonna

20:14.200 --> 20:16.833
- be able to close this deal, huh?
- Aw, no.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.967
- I'm sorry, brother.
- All right, man, thank you.

20:19.001 --> 20:20.098
- Thanks.
- All right.

20:20.098 --> 20:21.421
Sorry we couldn't work anything out.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.370
- It is...
- Glad I got to see it though.

20:23.404 --> 20:25.173
Yep.

20:25.207 --> 20:27.540
- But you got to see it.
- I did get to see it.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.307
Half the fun is, like, you know,

20:29.341 --> 20:31.211
sometimes you get to
see your childhood again

20:31.245 --> 20:33.114
and you're like, "this is amazing!"

20:33.149 --> 20:35.548
And when they tell you the price
you're like, "seeing is enough."

20:35.582 --> 20:37.548
[All laughing]

20:37.583 --> 20:39.450
Well, you won't need to
see that toy or touch it

20:39.485 --> 20:40.619
for another ten years, at least.

20:40.653 --> 20:42.154
Yeah, that's true.

20:42.188 --> 20:43.987
And that's all we got
for ya this week, man!

20:44.022 --> 20:46.190
Commissioner Gordon
turned off the bat signal.

20:46.224 --> 20:47.892
We're not needed in Gotham anymore.

20:47.926 --> 20:49.627
<i>For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

20:49.661 --> 20:51.193
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.228 --> 20:52.660
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:52.694 --> 20:55.894
In this space, no one can hear your scream.

20:55.929 --> 20:57.161
Good night.

20:57.587 --> 20:59.884
