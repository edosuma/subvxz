00:01.369 --> 00:04.203
<i> [Amy] Guests are waking up</i>
<i>  to this weird figure</i>
<i>  with no eyes.</i>

00:05.206 --> 00:06.238
[Amy] Who was that?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.173
-Did you see a shadow?
-Yes.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.143
Did you kill someone?

00:11.145 --> 00:16.382
You. Amy, you.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.051
<i> [woman] I think I wanna sleep</i>
<i>  in this room tomorrow.</i>

00:19.053 --> 00:22.221
<i>  It seems comfortable.</i>
<i>  I feel safe here.</i>

00:22.223 --> 00:25.090
-[distortion]
-What the actual...

00:26.627 --> 00:28.494
[Amy]
<i>  The dead want a voice.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:29.628
We just want to help
this family.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.230
[Adam]
The living need our help.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.599
-Have you always been here?
-He was watching already.

00:47.982 --> 00:51.116
[Adam] This is a beautiful
1850s house.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.218
[Amy] This is stunning!

00:53.220 --> 00:55.888
-[Adam] Incredible!
-[Amy] But apparently,
very, very haunted.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.258
So I mean, these guys
are pretty desperate.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.861
[Adam] Our client, Winn,
bought this piece of property
three years ago,

01:02.863 --> 01:05.898
and has had activity ever
since the day he got the keys.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.233
They're trying to run
a B&B here

01:08.235 --> 01:12.771
and guests are waking up
to this weird figure
with no eyes.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.407
I mean, that's terrifying!

01:15.409 --> 01:18.710
[Amy]
There's a unseen force
jiggling their door handles,

01:18.712 --> 01:20.079
they're hearing footsteps,

01:20.081 --> 01:22.214
they have guest books
where people detail

01:22.216 --> 01:25.918
these crazy things
that are happening.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.954
If you are relying on income
from a Bed & Breakfast,

01:28.956 --> 01:31.190
and those people
aren't going to stay here

01:31.192 --> 01:32.157
because of the activity,

01:32.159 --> 01:34.193
-that's a problem.
-Yeah.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.462
[Adam] And they also
live here, so they're
dealing with this 24/7.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.966
Who knows what has happened
over the years,

01:40.968 --> 01:44.203
-that could cause something
like this.
-Yeah. Let's go find out.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.538
[Amy]
Meet the guys, and have them
give us the lowdown

01:46.540 --> 01:48.140
-of what's going on.
-[Adam] Yeah.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.309
-We'll definitely have to stay
here at night, at least.
-[knocking on door]

01:52.246 --> 01:53.779
-Hey, y'all!
-[Amy] Hey, hi!

01:53.781 --> 01:56.482
-Amy! Pleased to meet you!
-[Winn] Hi, Winn, Yeah.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.052
-Welcome to Linville!
-[Adam] Thank you!

02:01.021 --> 02:03.055
-[Winn] My housemate, Josh.
-[Amy] Hi, Josh!

02:03.057 --> 02:04.189
-How's it goin'?
-[Adam] Nice to meet you!

02:04.191 --> 02:06.125
[Amy] Nice to meet you.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.827
[Winn]
Stumbled across this place
a few years ago,

02:08.829 --> 02:11.130
so I thought
that could easily turn it

02:11.132 --> 02:13.132
into a Bed & Breakfast
of sorts,

02:13.134 --> 02:16.001
-which is kind of what
we're trying to do.
-[Amy] Right. Mm-hm.

02:16.003 --> 02:19.972
Um, little did I know
that, historically,

02:19.974 --> 02:22.007
this place
is pretty fascinating.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.343
And so, the farm itself,

02:24.345 --> 02:25.944
which was originally
called Thorpeland,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.614
-dates back to the 1600s.
-Holy cow.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.617
John Smith owned the property,
John Smith of Jamestown.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.951
-Wow!
-[Adam] Okay. Wow!

02:32.953 --> 02:34.319
[Winn] He married a widow,

02:34.321 --> 02:36.221
and she actually was part
of the Bowies,

02:36.223 --> 02:38.423
-of Bowie, Maryland.
-Wow!

02:38.425 --> 02:41.894
The house exchanged hands
through the Bowies
for quite a while.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.029
Then, in the 1950s,

02:44.031 --> 02:47.199
a state representative,
Calvin D. Johnson, came in,

02:47.201 --> 02:50.502
totally retrofitted it,
added an extra wing onto it,

02:50.504 --> 02:54.840
and then renamed the property
from Thorpeland to Glad Acres.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.610
The house is actually
historically known
as the Bowie-Johnson house.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.045
-[Amy] Okay.
-Okay!

03:00.047 --> 03:01.613
Well, this place is huge.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.981
We should probably
get started.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.619
[Winn]
<i>  Welcome to the main lounge.</i>

03:07.621 --> 03:09.721
[Amy]
<i>  What happens in here,</i>
<i>  paranormal-wise?</i>

03:09.723 --> 03:12.224
Right after starting our work
on the house,

03:12.226 --> 03:14.793
I started to notice,
over and over several nights,

03:14.795 --> 03:17.930
it would sound like, either
a toolbox would fall over,

03:17.932 --> 03:20.165
or there would be a crash
on the wall,

03:20.167 --> 03:22.234
or like something, like,
on the stairs.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.770
And then it was,
like in a distance,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.471
I heard two men arguing.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.109
Josh also had an experience.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.111
[Josh] I was standing out
on the porch looking in,

03:33.113 --> 03:35.647
and I saw a man
walk from this door frame,

03:35.649 --> 03:41.153
and walk past the two windows
and into the foyer area.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.322
-[Adam] What did he look like?
-[Josh]
He was about your height.

03:43.324 --> 03:47.292
Um. It was a very obvious,
distinct shadow.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.028
So where did he start
walking from?

03:50.030 --> 03:51.330
Right here
from where I am standing.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.465
So he started
from the addition.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.967
From the addition. Yep.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.739
<i> [Winn] This is the ballroom.</i>

04:00.741 --> 04:01.940
<i>  Some nights,</i>
<i>  you'll be in here,</i>

04:01.942 --> 04:03.775
<i>  if there are guests staying.</i>

04:03.777 --> 04:05.877
And it sounds almost like
someone is dropping,

04:05.879 --> 04:07.879
like, a baseball,
a glass ball.

04:07.881 --> 04:11.250
It'll be, drop, roll.
Drop, roll.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.117
-In here?
-Upstairs.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.919
Up here.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.089
And other guests have reported
hearing people speaking
down here,

04:17.091 --> 04:19.925
-when no one else is around.
-[Amy] Mm. Okay.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.594
[Winn] We believe there are
multiple spirits here,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.896
but there's this one
that feels almost...

04:24.898 --> 04:27.232
It's a little bit like,
"I'm here in the doorway,

04:27.234 --> 04:30.302
-watching you guys
do your board games."
-That's strange.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.604
-We call him the Lurker.
-The Lurker.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.339
-The Lurker.
-Yeah.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.074
It's a little uncomfortable.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.944
Like he's trying
to make himself known.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.379
Like he, kind of, enjoys it,
I guess.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.214
Well, let's go see
the rest of the house.

04:42.216 --> 04:43.615
[Winn] Absolutely.

04:53.193 --> 04:56.161
[Winn]
<i>  This is currently my bedroom.</i>
<i>  We call it the 1852 room.</i>

04:56.163 --> 04:57.529
<i> [Amy] Okay. Okay.</i>

04:57.531 --> 04:59.865
[Winn]
This is sort of the apartment
side of the house.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.035
-All right.
-Things don't typically happen
on this side of the house,

05:03.037 --> 05:07.939
and I, kind of, attribute that
to the iron spikes
above the door.

05:07.941 --> 05:11.643
<i>  So every way</i>
<i>  into the apartment</i>
<i>  has spikes above it.</i>

05:12.313 --> 05:13.979
-Who did that?
-I did.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.814
That's an old
Central Pennsylvania,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.015
-you know the horseshoe above?
-[Amy] Yeah.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.150
So it's the same idea.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.752
-It's cold iron.
-Okay.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.987
[Adam]
<i>  Cold iron is a type of iron</i>

05:21.989 --> 05:23.855
<i>  that is mined</i>
<i>  deep underground,</i>

05:23.857 --> 05:26.792
<i>  and was said to be able</i>
<i>  to repel or contain ghosts,</i>

05:26.794 --> 05:28.727
<i> and other supernatural beings.</i>

05:28.729 --> 05:30.562
<i>  Iron fences around cemeteries</i>

05:30.564 --> 05:32.864
<i>  were seen as a way</i>
<i>  to keep spirits in.</i>

05:32.866 --> 05:35.867
<i>  And the tradition of putting</i>
<i>  up a horseshoe for good luck,</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:37.803
<i>  came from the fact</i>
<i>  that they are made of iron.</i>

05:37.805 --> 05:39.438
<i>  So it may have originally</i>
<i>  been used</i>

05:39.440 --> 05:41.840
<i>  as a way to ward off</i>
<i>  evil spirits.</i>

05:41.842 --> 05:43.608
But you've only got those
on this side of the house.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.043
On this side of the house.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.778
This side of the house
is very quiet.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.080
[Amy] Interesting!

05:48.916 --> 05:49.948
-Next bedroom?
-Yeah.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.249
-Let's go.
-Yeah, after you.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.187
[Winn]
<i>  This is the billiard room.</i>

05:55.189 --> 05:58.056
<i>  This was Calvin Johnson's</i>
<i>  office.</i>

05:58.792 --> 06:00.859
[Josh] What's interesting
about this room is,

06:00.861 --> 06:03.895
folks have walked
into just this space,

06:03.897 --> 06:06.865
-and have been hit with,
like, a heavy feeling.
-[Amy] Mm-hm.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.834
You, kind of, walk
into the space,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.936
and you know that there's
something going on here.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.104
[Adam]
Okay. Any activity in here?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.941
-Beyond the ominous feeling,
not so much.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.478
[Amy]
Okay, so we're going
to head to his bedroom?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.617
-[Winn] So this was
Calvin Johnson's bedroom.
-[Josh] Yeah.

06:25.619 --> 06:30.856
But this is where the Lurker
or the first, kind of,
made itself, you know, known.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.159
Um. People get an impression
of a man.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.961
Again, it's a very
masculine energy.

06:35.963 --> 06:39.264
Just standing right here
and just staring at them
in the bed.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.001
[Winn]
We've had two different women
that say, "he's right there."

06:43.003 --> 06:45.203
Like, they will point out
this space.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.339
-That spot. Okay.
-Weird.

06:47.341 --> 06:50.075
And they're like,
"I saw the eyeless man

06:50.077 --> 06:51.977
standing
at the foot of the bed,"

06:51.979 --> 06:55.480
-and then felt a tightening
sensation in her lungs.
-Ugh.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.016
They wrote it
in the guest book, too.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.887
And it's females in this room?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.422
-Yes.
-[Adam] Okay.

07:04.324 --> 07:07.159
So hearing something
distressing like that

07:07.161 --> 07:09.361
-is not great for the guests.
-[Amy] No.

07:10.764 --> 07:15.033
What's the ultimate goal
for the two of you, for us?

07:15.035 --> 07:18.270
Ideally, to try to track down
what this is,

07:18.272 --> 07:20.505
and to figure out
why it's so concerned with...

07:21.208 --> 07:22.974
-Yeah. Okay.
-[Winn] Because it's...

07:22.976 --> 07:24.075
It's a Bed & Breakfast,

07:24.077 --> 07:25.877
so there's going to be people
here all the time.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.978
[Winn] Yeah, and you don't
want it to get worse...

07:26.980 --> 07:28.980
-[Josh] Exactly!
-...by ignoring it.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.716
[Adam] Well, thank you.
We're going to get started,
and get our equipment ready.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.119
-Thank you, guys!
-[Adam] Thank you, guys!

07:34.121 --> 07:36.254
<i> [Adam] It's clear,</i>
<i>  from both Winn and Josh,</i>

07:36.256 --> 07:39.858
they have some really creepy,
unexplainable activity

07:39.860 --> 07:43.094
<i>  happening in this space,</i>
<i>  that is not welcome.</i>

07:43.096 --> 07:46.932
If you are waking up
and there is a figure

07:46.934 --> 07:49.968
<i>  lurking at your bed</i>
<i>  with no eyes.</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:53.104
I mean, that's really intense,
and really intimidating.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.607
<i>  So Amy and I need</i>
<i>  to figure out who it is.</i>

08:00.314 --> 08:01.880
[Amy] We're going to start
in the ballroom.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.951
Yeah. That is the only place
in this house

08:05.953 --> 08:09.921
that one of the two people
that will actually live here

08:09.923 --> 08:12.591
all the time,
saw something crazy.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.260
-Everything else
is people staying.
-Right.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.062
We just should start there
and we'll just move up.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.731
-So, let's do it.
-Exactly.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.200
<i> [Adam] So tonight, we just</i>
<i>  want to get a base reading</i>
<i>  of the space,</i>

08:22.202 --> 08:24.102
<i>  to find out who is here,</i>
<i>  why they're here,</i>

08:24.104 --> 08:27.005
<i>  and if anyone</i>
<i>  is in any danger.</i>

08:30.811 --> 08:34.279
[Adam] I'm going to set up
the laser grid here,

08:35.382 --> 08:38.617
because this is where they
saw the apparition

08:38.619 --> 08:42.187
walk from this part
of the doorway
through that room.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.256
So, I'm going to use
this laser grid,

08:44.258 --> 08:47.259
which will be able
to capture anything

08:47.261 --> 08:50.595
that might step
within the vicinity
of this red grid.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.401
[Amy] Let's sit back,
where we can watch all this.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.607
We're trying to figure out
who's here,

09:03.277 --> 09:05.043
who's always with the house.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.245
Someone
who could be non-living.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.816
My name is Adam,
and this is Amy.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.318
[Amy] Hi, there!

09:13.320 --> 09:17.322
[Adam] And we've been invited
to come into this house

09:17.324 --> 09:21.126
by Winn and Josh.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.961
[soft knock]

09:22.963 --> 09:24.963
[Amy]
Did you just hit this wall?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.436
Yeah, I didn't do it.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.605
Hello!

09:34.207 --> 09:36.007
[knocking]

09:42.249 --> 09:44.115
-[Amy] Did you hear it?
-Footsteps.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.085
It sounded like it was like up
or like in that area.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.055
[Amy]
They did say that they hear
footsteps upstairs a lot.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.527
Is anybody home?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.097
[soft creaking]

10:02.269 --> 10:03.969
-[Amy] Did you hear that?
-Yeah. Above us.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.370
[Amy] Yeah!

10:05.372 --> 10:07.038
Adam, I think we should go
upstairs,

10:07.040 --> 10:08.640
because that voice was loud.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.622
I just got
the ookie-ookie feeling.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.362
-Oh! It feels so weird!
-Do you feel that?

10:30.364 --> 10:33.198
<i> [Josh] Folks have walked</i>
<i>  into just this space,</i>

10:33.200 --> 10:36.001
-and have been hit
with, like, a heavy feeling.
-[Amy] Mm-hm.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.336
[Adam]
We're coming into your space.

10:40.107 --> 10:44.142
[Amy] I don't know,
I just get a really weird
feeling back here, right now.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.422
Just a definite feeling
when you come into...

10:57.424 --> 10:59.858
Like you cross that threshold.
It's very weird.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.793
[Adam] It's heavy.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.963
You have this person,
sort of, looming and lurking.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.998
Seems to watch women.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.800
What if you go over there,

11:08.802 --> 11:10.869
and I just sit in here
completely by myself,

11:10.871 --> 11:13.138
-and do an EVP session?
-[Adam] Yeah.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.211
I'm going to sit here.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.550
Okay, I'm settled.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.455
[Amy]
Whoever you are, can you tell
me what your name is, please?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.560
What do you think of people
who sleep here?

11:36.997 --> 11:40.098
Do you like it when you have
overnight guests in this room?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.203
I think I'm going to sleep
in this room tomorrow.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.306
It seems comfortable.
Should I feel safe here?

11:50.944 --> 11:53.211
Should everyone
feel safe here?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.516
Has anything bad
ever happened here?

12:04.991 --> 12:06.858
[recorder playing static]

12:06.860 --> 12:09.627
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Whoever you are, can you tell</i>
<i>  me what your name is, please?</i>

12:09.629 --> 12:11.529
-[loud noise]
-Oh, my...

12:19.639 --> 12:22.307
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Whoever you are, can you tell</i>
<i>  me what your name is, please?</i>

12:22.309 --> 12:24.008
[loud noise]

12:24.010 --> 12:26.244
I'm supposed to sleep
in here after that.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.614
It's like screaming
into this thing.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.185
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  What do you think of people</i>
<i>  who sleep here?</i>

12:34.187 --> 12:37.222
<i>  Do you like it when you have</i>
<i> overnight guests in this room?</i>

12:37.224 --> 12:38.056
[muttering]

12:38.058 --> 12:40.258
Oh, my God!

12:40.260 --> 12:42.994
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  I think I'm going to sleep</i>
<i>  in this room tomorrow.</i>

12:42.996 --> 12:46.264
<i>  It seems comfortable.</i>
<i>  Should I feel safe here?</i>

12:46.266 --> 12:49.267
-[loud screech]
-What the actual...

12:50.237 --> 12:52.003
[Adam] Okay.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.806
[Amy]
I want you to listen to this,

12:54.808 --> 12:58.076
and then tell me if you would
like to sleep in this room...

12:58.078 --> 13:00.044
-[Adam] Okay.
-...after hearing it.

13:00.046 --> 13:02.213
[Adam] Okay.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.016
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Whoever you are, can you tell</i>
<i>  me what your name is, please?</i>

13:05.018 --> 13:06.417
[loud noise]

13:08.455 --> 13:10.087
[Amy] And listen to this.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.090
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  I think I'm going to sleep</i>
<i>  in this room tomorrow.</i>

13:12.092 --> 13:14.993
<i>  It seems comfortable.</i>
<i>  Should I feel safe here?</i>

13:15.228 --> 13:18.096
-[loud screech]
-Again!

13:18.098 --> 13:20.031
-What the [bleep] is that?
-[Adam] I don't know.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.199
Like, what the [bleep]
is that?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.934
Oh, God! I don't know.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.102
[Amy] Here, you can listen.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.670
[Adam] It's weird
that those two were like...

13:25.672 --> 13:27.572
[Amy] It's just like...

13:27.574 --> 13:31.009
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  What do you think of people</i>
<i>  who sleep here?</i>

13:31.011 --> 13:33.278
<i>  Do you like it when you have</i>
<i> overnight guests in this room?</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:34.979
[mumble]

13:34.981 --> 13:35.747
-Hear that?
-[Adam] Yeah.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.382
I don't know what it's saying.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.985
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  What do you think of people</i>
<i>  who sleep here?</i>

13:40.987 --> 13:43.621
<i>  Do you like it when you have</i>
<i> overnight guests in this room?</i>

13:43.623 --> 13:46.558
-[mumbling]
-I do. I do.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.830
I just feel like there's some
part of this puzzle...

13:51.832 --> 13:54.232
-That... Yeah, yeah, I agree.
-...that we're missing.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.634
<i> [Amy] I think Adam and I</i>
<i>  are absolutely convinced</i>

13:56.636 --> 13:57.868
<i>  this house is haunted.</i>

13:57.870 --> 14:00.171
<i>  We have seen things,</i>
<i>  we have heard a gruff voice,</i>

14:00.173 --> 14:03.808
<i>  someone who wasn't happy</i>
<i>  and that's not okay.</i>

14:03.810 --> 14:06.277
Winn and Josh are living
with this all the time,

14:06.279 --> 14:09.214
and they also want
to bring guests here.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.983
So we do need to, kind of,
get a handle on this,

14:11.985 --> 14:14.252
<i>  and figure out</i>
<i>  who's responsible</i>

14:14.254 --> 14:16.588
<i>  for some</i>
<i>  of that threatening-type</i>
<i>  activity.</i>

14:25.799 --> 14:27.098
<i> [Adam] Amy and I are about</i>
<i>  to call Chip</i>

14:27.100 --> 14:28.800
<i>  to get his impressions</i>
<i>  on the house,</i>

14:28.802 --> 14:30.401
<i>  but we wanted to start</i>
<i>  in the room</i>

14:30.403 --> 14:33.204
<i>  that has</i>
<i>  the most crazy activity.</i>

14:33.206 --> 14:35.707
We really are interested
in finding out

14:35.709 --> 14:36.841
what's happening here

14:36.843 --> 14:38.042
<i>  and we don't want to waste</i>
<i>  any time.</i>

14:38.044 --> 14:40.078
<i> [Adam on phone] Hey, Chip!</i>

14:40.080 --> 14:42.113
Okay,
so we're gonna start here

14:42.616 --> 14:46.251
<i>  and show you this room.</i>

14:46.253 --> 14:48.920
Alright, I see Chris,
our camera operator,

14:48.922 --> 14:51.723
-standing at the foot
of the bed.
<i> -[Amy] Mm-hm.</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:53.024
<i> [Chip] And there's somebody</i>
<i>  that stands there</i>

14:53.026 --> 14:55.026
<i>  and watches people</i>
<i>  while they sleep.</i>

14:56.096 --> 14:59.831
People get an impression
of a man just standing
right here

14:59.833 --> 15:01.532
and just staring at them
in the bed.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.935
[Amy]
<i>  Do you know who it is?</i>

15:05.071 --> 15:06.337
No, not yet.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.739
-[Amy] Okay.
-Alright!

15:07.741 --> 15:09.507
We'll head this way.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.016
Oh, he's making his way
around in other rooms, too,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.317
because he's been
in this one, too.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.885
He has? Okay.

15:20.887 --> 15:25.189
And you're not picking up
a vibe of, like, who it is.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.159
I am not picking anything up
in that room right now.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.260
[Adam] Okay.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.269
I hear this is his room.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.638
This is his room, meaning?

15:42.008 --> 15:45.677
Whoever he is,
not sure of that yet,

15:45.679 --> 15:48.279
but it's historic,
and this is his room.

15:48.281 --> 15:52.083
-[Amy] Okay.
<i> -[Chip] I'm very possessive.</i>
<i>  This is his room.</i>

15:56.423 --> 15:58.656
<i>  He's a very dominant spirit,</i>

15:58.658 --> 16:00.458
-wherever this guy is.
<i> -[Amy] Mm-hm.</i>

16:00.460 --> 16:03.061
<i> [Chip] He's, like, laying</i>
<i>  claim to this space.</i>

16:03.063 --> 16:06.264
<i> -[Amy] Like, the whole place?</i>
<i> -Pretty much!</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:09.934
[Amy] Can you get a vibe
of how long he's been here?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.370
He's been there a while.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.974
I mean I think he's been there
for quite a long time.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.542
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.618
Where's the front door?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.754
Right there.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.457
I feel a lot of people come
and go out through this door,

16:32.459 --> 16:35.159
and a lot of people have come
and gone through this house.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.461
[Amy] Mm-hm.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.864
<i> [Chip] It feels like</i>
<i>  this place has changed owners</i>

16:39.866 --> 16:42.033
<i>  or changed hands.</i>

16:42.035 --> 16:44.969
And it feels like
whoever is there,

16:44.971 --> 16:47.138
there's some sort of feeling

16:47.140 --> 16:49.474
<i> about the fact that this place</i>

16:49.476 --> 16:52.477
<i>  has, kind of,</i>
<i>  been taken away from him.</i>

16:53.246 --> 16:54.579
Has the name changed?

16:55.849 --> 16:56.914
In the 1950s,

16:56.916 --> 16:59.384
a state representative,
Calvin D. Johnson,

16:59.386 --> 17:03.821
renamed the property
from Thorpland to Glad Acres.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.623
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.395
<i> [Chip] I will tell you this.</i>

17:10.397 --> 17:13.231
The most active areas
that I've felt so far,

17:13.233 --> 17:15.066
as you walked me through,

17:15.068 --> 17:16.834
<i>  are definitely</i>
<i>  the upstairs rooms.</i>

17:16.836 --> 17:18.736
-Yep!
-Okay, yeah, it makes sense.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.938
<i> [Amy] There is, like,</i>
<i>  a spirit, I guess, upstairs,</i>

17:20.940 --> 17:22.273
<i>  that's really freaking</i>
<i>  people out.</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:24.609
<i>  Like you said,</i>
<i> the spirit looking over people</i>

17:24.611 --> 17:26.177
<i>  when they're sleeping.</i>

17:26.179 --> 17:29.013
And so, that's
what we're trying to get
to the bottom of.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.983
-He's kind of arrogant.
-Mm-hm.

17:31.985 --> 17:33.184
And this is the way
that it feels to me,

17:33.186 --> 17:35.153
that he's saying like,

17:35.155 --> 17:38.289
"You know, there's no way
you don't know who I am."

17:39.225 --> 17:40.258
<i> -[Amy] Okay.</i>
<i> -[Adam] Okay.</i>

17:40.260 --> 17:41.292
Alright.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.161
Alright.
Well, thank you, Chip!

17:43.163 --> 17:44.962
Thank you!
We'll keep you posted.

17:47.133 --> 17:50.868
<i> [Amy] I think it's interesting</i>
<i>  that Chip picked up</i>
<i>  on this looming male figure,</i>

17:50.870 --> 17:52.170
which is exactly
what people report.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.440
And last night, sitting
in that room by myself,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.942
got this really aggressive
male voice.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.079
So, it's like we've confirmed,
yes, there is this ghost here,

18:01.081 --> 18:04.849
or entity here,
but who and why?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.752
Chip said it moves,
whoever they are,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.321
so we could try
to experiment with that.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.890
[Adam] I remember
during the walkthrough,

18:12.892 --> 18:16.761
he showed us those nails
above the door frame.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.296
[Amy]
Yeah, we should definitely do
an experiment with that.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.599
I think,
if we take those down,

18:21.601 --> 18:24.035
um, and then investigate
in that room,

18:24.037 --> 18:25.068
and see if anything happened.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.906
[Adam] Yeah, you know,
building on your idea,

18:28.908 --> 18:31.142
I just want to say, I don't
want to say it in here,

18:31.144 --> 18:33.077
because what if he's, like,
listening?

18:33.079 --> 18:34.512
[Amy] Let's go outside.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.988
You know how they put up
the nails

18:43.990 --> 18:46.257
-on this side of the house.
-[Amy] Right.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.192
[Adam] So if we're going
to take them down,

18:48.194 --> 18:50.061
what we first should do...

18:50.063 --> 18:51.829
But you should go
in the conservatory
by yourself again,

18:51.831 --> 18:53.064
and see if he's in there.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.799
And then, while he's in there
with you,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.168
I'm going to put it
on the outside
of the door frame

18:57.170 --> 18:58.136
that leads to the hallway.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.104
So that he, technically,

19:00.106 --> 19:01.305
couldn't come
through the doorway

19:01.307 --> 19:03.207
to go into that hallway
upstairs.

19:03.209 --> 19:06.978
What if I go around the house
by myself,

19:06.980 --> 19:09.914
until we get a response
from him again.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.983
And as soon as we get
that EVP response,

19:11.985 --> 19:13.818
you put those things
on the door.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.820
-And block them in that space.
-And keep them in that space.

19:15.822 --> 19:20.091
-Yeah. Yeah.
-So, let's go give it a try.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.834
[Adam] What's a word
that you could tell me

19:29.836 --> 19:33.137
that you're like hitting
the space, like a code?

19:33.139 --> 19:35.039
[Amy] I'll say "I'd like
a cup of tea, please."

19:35.041 --> 19:36.407
[Adam] Great! Perfect!

19:39.279 --> 19:41.379
So whoever was talking to me
last night,

19:41.381 --> 19:43.581
I'm going to be by myself
in here.

19:45.351 --> 19:49.153
[Adam] Three, two, one.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.255
So, I'm going
to remove the nails.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.356
[Amy] Okay.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.862
Hey, Adam, I think maybe
you should go downstairs.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.063
[Adam] Yeah.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.037
Whoever the gentleman was,

20:06.039 --> 20:07.905
who was speaking to me
last night,

20:07.907 --> 20:11.976
I'm alone over here,
if you'd like to talk.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.548
Can you tell me your name?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.118
Is your last name Bowie?

20:23.122 --> 20:25.423
Did you know the Johnsons?

20:28.261 --> 20:30.995
Again I ask, am I safe here?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.202
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Can you tell me your name?</i>

20:38.972 --> 20:43.074
[static sound]

20:43.076 --> 20:47.111
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Is your last name Bowie?</i>
<i>  Did you know the Johnsons?</i>

20:47.914 --> 20:50.314
<i>  Again I ask, am I safe here?</i>

20:51.985 --> 20:53.284
Okay, I'm gonna move
to Winn's room.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.152
[Adam] Mm-hm.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.597
You know,
we took down those things,

21:06.599 --> 21:10.368
that Josh and Winn put
so much faith in.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.203
What do you think about those?

21:12.805 --> 21:14.505
Do those work?

21:15.241 --> 21:17.575
Can you tell me
what your name is?

21:19.078 --> 21:21.646
If I sleep here tonight,
will I be safe?

21:23.416 --> 21:26.117
If I sleep
in the conservatory,

21:26.853 --> 21:28.653
or Mr. Johnson's old room,

21:28.655 --> 21:31.455
over that way,
will I be safe in that room?

21:33.192 --> 21:36.560
Do you like that this is now
called Linville Manor?

21:43.269 --> 21:45.836
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  we took down those things,</i>

21:45.838 --> 21:49.106
<i>  that Josh and Winn</i>
<i>  put so much faith in.</i>

21:49.108 --> 21:51.042
<i> What do you think about those?</i>

21:51.044 --> 21:53.010
<i>  Do those work?</i>

21:54.681 --> 21:57.081
<i>  Can you tell me</i>
<i>  what your name is?</i>

21:57.083 --> 21:59.383
<i>  If I sleep here tonight,</i>
<i>  will I be safe?</i>

21:59.385 --> 22:00.584
<i> [voice on recorder] No.</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:02.953
I need a cup of tea, please.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.955
It's time. It's time.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.565
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Do you like that this is now</i>
<i>  called Linville Manor?</i>

22:16.436 --> 22:17.968
-[Amy] No.
-[Adam] No.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.741
Okay, I'll come with you.

22:23.743 --> 22:29.080
[Adam] The idea at this point
is, we felt like he,

22:29.082 --> 22:30.715
or whatever was
in this room...

22:30.717 --> 22:32.383
[Amy]
Will hopefully stay there.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.318
-[Adam] Because
we put up the nails.
-[Amy] Right.

22:37.357 --> 22:41.859
So, I guess what we are
seeing now is if he comes out.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.961
Should I go back
in that room now

22:43.963 --> 22:45.329
and investigate in there,
and see if that...

22:45.331 --> 22:46.864
[Adam] I would say so,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.966
because he should not be back
in that space.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.234
[Amy] Right. Let's try it.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.304
<i> [Adam] We need to make sure</i>
<i>  that the aggressive spirit</i>

22:53.306 --> 22:55.272
<i>  is actually trapped</i>
<i>  in Winn's room.</i>

22:55.274 --> 22:58.175
<i>  So we're going to canvas</i>
<i> the house for any sign of him.</i>

22:58.177 --> 23:01.212
<i>  If we don't hear from him,</i>
<i>  our experiment worked.</i>

23:01.214 --> 23:03.180
[Adam] Amy, I'm going
to set up the laser grid.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.582
[Amy] Okay.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.859
Hi, there, my name is Amy

23:14.861 --> 23:17.595
and I'm going to be sleeping
in this room tonight.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.099
Can you tell me
what your name is?

23:23.336 --> 23:25.436
Should I feel safe here?

23:27.840 --> 23:30.174
Now, if you're not normally
in this room,

23:30.176 --> 23:31.175
if this is the first chance

23:31.177 --> 23:33.310
you've had to come here
in a while,

23:33.312 --> 23:35.146
can you tell me your name?

23:38.951 --> 23:41.419
Is there someone
who stopped you

23:41.421 --> 23:43.421
from coming into this room?

23:45.324 --> 23:46.557
[rumbling]

23:46.559 --> 23:49.093
-What was that?
-[Amy] What was what?

23:49.095 --> 23:53.030
-Uh, I just heard a bang.
-[Amy] I heard a...

23:53.032 --> 23:55.166
-Like a boom.
-[Amy] I didn't hear that.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.467
It's not from here.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.804
Maybe someone's
a little upset.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.572
[Adam] I mean it was loud.

24:06.279 --> 24:08.012
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Hi, there, my name is Amy</i>

24:08.014 --> 24:10.981
<i>  and I'm going to be sleeping</i>
<i>  in this room tonight.</i>

24:12.418 --> 24:15.052
<i>  Can you tell me</i>
<i>  what your name is?</i>

24:15.054 --> 24:16.720
<i>  Should I feel safe here?</i>

24:16.722 --> 24:18.122
[man mumbling]

24:18.124 --> 24:20.357
-Sounds
like a different voice.
-[Amy] It does.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.628
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Now, if you're not normally</i>
<i>  in this room,</i>

24:24.630 --> 24:26.897
<i>  if this is the first chance</i>
<i>  you've had to come here</i>

24:26.899 --> 24:29.633
<i>  in a while,</i>
<i>  can you tell me your name?</i>

24:29.635 --> 24:31.101
[screech]

24:31.103 --> 24:33.637
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Is there someone</i>
<i>  who stopped you</i>

24:33.639 --> 24:35.239
<i>  from coming into this room?</i>

24:35.241 --> 24:36.173
[whispering on the recorder]

24:36.175 --> 24:38.242
That's weird.
There's another voice.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.944
I don't know, does that sound
like the same voice to you?

24:39.946 --> 24:41.779
[Adam] No, it does not.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.881
It's just like a quick,
like... [exhales]

24:43.883 --> 24:45.549
[Adam]
It sounds female, honestly.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.353
I mean, the other voice
is very angry.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.255
[footsteps walking]

24:51.257 --> 24:53.157
-What was that?
-I don't know.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.529
<i> -[Amy] You heard that, right?</i>
<i> -[Adam] Yeah!</i>

24:59.899 --> 25:01.765
It sounds like it's coming
to my... From my right.

25:01.767 --> 25:03.601
Oh, so it's from that room?

25:05.938 --> 25:10.007
[Adam] Like, it feels
so crazy right now.

25:11.377 --> 25:15.145
[Amy] Okay.
So safe to say that worked.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.947
And he's upset.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.987
I have, kind of, a thought,
yeah.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.623
We've got him
where we want him.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.958
-Let's go ask him.
-[Adam] Yeah.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.927
It's like have
a "Come to Jesus" meeting
in Winn's room.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.229
[Amy]
He can't leave, supposedly.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.668
We're back.

25:37.670 --> 25:41.338
We brought some additional
things to try to talk to you.

25:41.340 --> 25:46.043
[Adam]
These devices will help us
interact with you better.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.145
I'm going to set the flux up
over here

25:48.147 --> 25:49.313
in the center of the room.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.882
This will let us know

25:51.884 --> 25:53.684
if anybody passes
through this section,

25:53.686 --> 25:55.019
and how far away they are.

25:55.021 --> 25:58.322
[Amy] If you touch this,
it will make a noise,

25:58.324 --> 26:01.125
and this can say words.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.162
[Adam] Okay, sir.
So we're going to exit.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.537
[soft beeping]

26:13.539 --> 26:15.239
-[Amy] That's the flux
going on.
-[Adam] Yeah.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.975
Are you checking out
what we left for you?

26:17.977 --> 26:19.910
-Flashlight's on.
-[Amy] Flashlight's going on.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.412
Flux is going off.

26:21.414 --> 26:24.114
[Adam] Sir, do you want to get
out of that room?

26:25.217 --> 26:28.752
[Amy] If you can make
all of that equipment
go off at once,

26:28.754 --> 26:30.588
if you can make the REM pod,

26:31.924 --> 26:34.959
if you can turn on
some flashlights.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.029
Flashlight went off.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.798
Look, it's getting more...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.366
-[Adam] Agitated.
-[Amy] ...agitated.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.002
You know, the iron railroad
spikes up here

26:45.004 --> 26:46.704
that we put up here,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.973
that are keeping you there,

26:48.975 --> 26:54.645
they're keeping you there
because Josh willed them to.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.348
So if you want to stay,

26:59.619 --> 27:06.056
you need to stop approaching
people when they're alone.

27:06.058 --> 27:10.027
[soft tapping]

27:10.029 --> 27:12.129
-Hear that?
-What is that noise?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.501
Wait, it's the Ovilus.

27:19.138 --> 27:23.040
-[Adam] That's weird.
-[Amy] It just stopped.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.742
[Adam] I guess you understand
what we're talking about.

27:24.744 --> 27:25.776
You're in this space,

27:25.778 --> 27:30.280
because we can do things
with intention

27:30.282 --> 27:33.150
that creates boundaries
for you.

27:34.387 --> 27:36.153
You know what he was doing?

27:36.922 --> 27:38.389
He was showing us
what he could do.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.190
Right.

27:40.259 --> 27:43.861
[Amy] He was showing us,
"You're going to tell me
I have to leave?

27:43.863 --> 27:48.032
Well, I'm going to show you
that I can break
your equipment."

27:48.034 --> 27:49.933
-Right. "I'm gonna stop."
-[Amy] "I'm gonna stop.

27:49.935 --> 27:51.935
I didn't want to talk."
That's okay.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.371
Listen, I don't know
who you are,

27:54.373 --> 27:56.674
we don't know
how you got here,

27:56.676 --> 27:57.975
you're not telling us
anything,

27:57.977 --> 28:00.277
I don't think you're going
to tell us anything,

28:00.279 --> 28:03.313
but we're not letting you
out of this room tonight.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.949
Think about it for the night,

28:05.951 --> 28:07.317
and hopefully
you've changed your mind.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.020
Otherwise, we will do
something here,

28:10.022 --> 28:13.323
that will cause you to not be
in this house at all.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.592
Yeah, mister,
you're in a timeout.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.594
[Amy] I know, he literally
is in a timeout.

28:20.599 --> 28:22.733
<i> [Amy] So, now we know</i>
<i>  how to control it,</i>

28:22.735 --> 28:26.603
but now we're not quite sure
who this is or what this is.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.172
<i>  You know, I think</i>
<i>  the big thing here is</i>

28:28.240 --> 28:31.041
<i>  that Adam and I do feel</i>
<i>  like we're making some sort</i>
<i>  of progress,</i>

28:31.043 --> 28:34.044
but we have a lot of questions
still to answer,

28:34.046 --> 28:36.380
with just one more night left
in the manor.

28:42.922 --> 28:46.423
I have all of the deeds
from 1849.

28:46.425 --> 28:52.229
and it's been in the Bowie
and McCeney family

28:52.231 --> 28:55.032
almost the entire time,

28:55.034 --> 28:57.401
until Calvin Johnson
bought it.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.335
We can go through these later

28:58.337 --> 29:00.037
and use them
during our investigation.

29:00.039 --> 29:06.143
Right. So tonight, clearly,
we need to investigate more,

29:06.145 --> 29:10.814
especially
with our gentleman friend
still locked in that room.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.950
Yeah, I mean, we saw
how the activity level changed

29:12.952 --> 29:14.351
when he was in there.

29:14.353 --> 29:18.122
We should probably
do something in this room,
in the library,

29:18.124 --> 29:20.157
and see what kind of evidence
we can get from it.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.160
Well, sounds like a busy night
of experiments

29:23.162 --> 29:26.764
-and investigating, and...
-Letting him out.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.532
Letting him out?

29:33.606 --> 29:37.074
-[Amy] Oh. Who was that?
-[Adam] What?

29:38.410 --> 29:39.476
Who was that?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.246
-Did you see a shadow?
-Yes.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.914
Right on that thing,
right there.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.083
[Josh] So, I was standing out
on the porch looking in,

29:46.085 --> 29:48.385
and I saw a man
walk from this door frame,

29:48.387 --> 29:52.489
and walk past the two windows
and into the foyer area.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.957
And I was looking right at it.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.332
So weird!

30:02.334 --> 30:04.968
I mean do we go in there now?
Or...

30:04.970 --> 30:06.436
I mean, I guess, we should.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.005
-Just to go see?
-Yeah!

30:08.007 --> 30:09.139
Just to go look?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.941
It's just so bizarre!

30:18.751 --> 30:21.885
[Adam] I set up the flux
to see if anybody would
come near it.

30:21.887 --> 30:27.057
Obviously, we have the...
We have the K2 there.

30:32.464 --> 30:36.433
If there's anybody in here,
we are having a little party.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.602
Amy saw someone,

30:40.105 --> 30:42.573
we couldn't really make out
anything but your shadow.

30:43.676 --> 30:45.475
Could you tell us
what your name is?

30:49.248 --> 30:52.549
Can you come into this room
from the ballroom?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.020
Come on!

30:58.591 --> 31:01.358
Was the ballroom here
when you were here?

31:02.595 --> 31:04.595
[radio static]

31:04.597 --> 31:06.463
[Adam on the recorder]
<i>  Amy saw someone,</i>

31:06.465 --> 31:08.799
<i>  we couldn't really make out</i>
<i>  anything but your shadow.</i>

31:08.801 --> 31:10.934
-[Amy] Adam.
-[Adam] Yeah?

31:10.936 --> 31:12.636
There's someone in the door.

31:12.638 --> 31:15.505
Hi! Who are you?

31:17.309 --> 31:19.543
I see you in the doorway.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.981
It's coming closer,

31:24.383 --> 31:25.983
and it's gone.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.420
-Yeah.
-[Adam] That's weird!

31:30.422 --> 31:32.356
I mean, that's
what he said he saw.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.126
Here, we'll play this.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.228
[Adam on the recorder]
<i>  Amy saw someone,</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:40.664
<i>  we couldn't really make out</i>
<i>  anything but your shadow.</i>

31:40.666 --> 31:43.233
<i>  Can you tell us</i>
<i>  what your name is?</i>

31:43.235 --> 31:46.169
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Can you come into this room</i>
<i>  from the ballroom?</i>

31:47.006 --> 31:48.171
<i>  Come on.</i>

31:49.174 --> 31:51.608
<i>  Was the ballroom here</i>
<i>  when you were here?</i>

31:54.179 --> 31:55.646
[Adam] It didn't interact
with the K2,

31:55.648 --> 31:57.614
it didn't interact
with the flux.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.750
-[Amy] Mm-mm.
-[Adam] I mean, maybe we got
something on the recorder,

31:59.752 --> 32:01.318
but it wasn't
that identifiable.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.387
-Yeah.
-So, maybe it's just left-over

32:03.389 --> 32:04.988
pent-up residual energy

32:04.990 --> 32:06.857
that's, sort of, like,
firing off.

32:06.859 --> 32:08.091
I think it is.

32:08.093 --> 32:12.963
So, I mean, I think
we pack up and regroup.

32:12.965 --> 32:13.797
-Yeah, let's regroup.
-Okay.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.299
Figure out what to do next.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.941
<i> [Adam] I mean, it's so weird</i>
<i>  that all that activity</i>
<i>  just was like,</i>

32:23.943 --> 32:25.842
<i>  "Here it is.</i>
<i>  Here's the activity."</i>

32:25.844 --> 32:28.412
<i> [Amy] We don't really know</i>
<i>  who this person is,</i>

32:28.414 --> 32:29.880
<i>  and what their motivation is,</i>

32:29.882 --> 32:32.182
<i>  and why they're acting</i>
<i>  the way they do.</i>

32:32.184 --> 32:36.586
-Right.
-So, do we go let our guy out?

32:36.588 --> 32:37.854
Yeah, let's go have
a conversation.

32:37.856 --> 32:41.892
I mean, he's been there
the rest of our night,

32:41.894 --> 32:44.895
-and all day today till now.
-Mm-hm.

32:44.897 --> 32:47.230
I feel like we should have
a conversation with him

32:47.232 --> 32:52.202
-and then release him?
-Yeah. Mm-hm.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.008
-All righty!
-[Adam] Alright, here we go!

33:11.790 --> 33:13.090
Now, sir, listen. Don't...

33:13.092 --> 33:15.125
The fact that we're taking
these spikes down

33:15.127 --> 33:20.063
does not give you permission
to run amok.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.497
We're taking it down,

33:21.834 --> 33:24.167
because we want to give you
the respect that you deserve,

33:24.169 --> 33:26.169
and we expect the same
in return.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.939
[Amy] We're going to leave
these here, so...

33:28.941 --> 33:31.241
-[Adam] Here we go! That's it.
-Here we go.

33:34.613 --> 33:38.015
<i> [Adam] Now that we've let him</i>
<i>  out, we want to see</i>
<i>  if he'll be more open</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:40.450
<i>  to communicating with us</i>
<i>  somewhere else in the house.</i>

33:47.726 --> 33:52.162
[Amy]
<i>  So, right now, Adam is going</i>
<i>  under, using the Frank's Box.</i>

33:52.164 --> 33:55.265
This is actually designed
by Frank Sumption,

33:55.267 --> 33:56.967
who created the spirit box.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.603
I find them to be
highly effective.

34:03.108 --> 34:06.043
So, if there's anyone
who wants to talk to us,

34:06.045 --> 34:08.345
you can talk
through my friend, Adam.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.983
-Wait!
-Wait for what?

34:14.186 --> 34:16.253
Do you want me
to stop talking?

34:17.056 --> 34:19.389
Do you want to talk to us
another way?

34:20.125 --> 34:22.559
-Can you give me a hint?
-I don't!

34:26.265 --> 34:28.465
-I'm here.
-Yes, you're here.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.267
You know who I am?

34:31.270 --> 34:32.636
Are you Calvin?

34:35.007 --> 34:38.241
Make it right.
You can make it right.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.412
So, tell me what that is
and we'll help.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.048
What do you want
to be made right?

34:45.684 --> 34:48.585
-Ladies are present.
-Yeah.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.288
I mean, I realize
there's ladies present.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.889
Just myself
and one other woman.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.991
Yeah!

34:54.993 --> 34:57.861
So, any... Whatever it is
that you want to tell,

34:57.863 --> 35:00.197
-you can tell.
-Obviously!

35:02.267 --> 35:03.600
There's someone here

35:03.602 --> 35:08.338
who likes to make people
feel vulnerable.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.307
Is that you? Are you do...

35:10.309 --> 35:12.175
Are you trying to make
people scared?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.011
I'm desperate.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.982
-What did you do?
-Dead people.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.017
Did you kill someone?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.619
You.

35:23.055 --> 35:25.489
Amy, you.

35:31.063 --> 35:35.365
I feel like you're trying
to make me feel threatened?

35:36.168 --> 35:37.300
I don't.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.269
Right here!

35:43.876 --> 35:46.343
[Amy whispering]

35:52.451 --> 35:53.617
Come back.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.123
It's very confusing.

36:24.917 --> 36:25.982
Okay.

36:25.984 --> 36:28.218
I feel like there's somebody
on me right now,

36:28.220 --> 36:29.252
like really close.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.363
Jeez. God!

36:42.434 --> 36:43.466
Oh.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.135
Oh!

36:45.137 --> 36:48.004
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

36:48.006 --> 36:52.842
You could tell like it
was that same guy...

36:52.844 --> 36:55.145
-Yeah. Okay.
-...coming through.

36:55.147 --> 36:56.880
So, like basically,
it started out,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.682
like, reasonably enough.

36:58.684 --> 36:59.916
Then you were like, "Wait!"

36:59.918 --> 37:03.720
And I said, "Do you want
to talk another way?"

37:03.722 --> 37:05.222
And you said, "I don't."

37:05.224 --> 37:08.124
And you said,
"Do you know who I am?"

37:08.126 --> 37:11.094
And then you said,
"You can make it right."

37:11.096 --> 37:12.963
And then I'm like,
"Is that, like, a regret?

37:12.965 --> 37:14.464
Do you need to talk
to someone?

37:14.466 --> 37:16.099
Is there someone
you want to talk to?"

37:16.101 --> 37:18.201
And you said,
"Ladies are present."

37:18.637 --> 37:20.036
I said, "It doesn't matter."

37:20.038 --> 37:22.539
I said, "Yeah,
there's a couple ladies,
me and one other."

37:22.541 --> 37:25.108
I said, "But you can speak,"
and you said, "I know."

37:25.911 --> 37:27.177
And I said, "What did you do?"

37:27.179 --> 37:28.778
And you said, "Dead people."

37:28.780 --> 37:31.114
-Mm.
-And I was like,
"Did you kill someone?"

37:31.116 --> 37:35.085
-And you said,
"You. Amy, you."
-Oh!

37:35.087 --> 37:37.354
So then I was like, "I'm going
to go get the spikes."

37:37.356 --> 37:39.689
So, I went upstairs
and you were like,

37:39.691 --> 37:42.425
"Come back. I'm confused."

37:42.427 --> 37:45.262
-Oh!
-And I got the spikes
and put them down,

37:45.264 --> 37:47.797
and then it stopped.

37:47.799 --> 37:51.334
-Yo, that's so weird!
-Yeah, it was really strange.

37:51.336 --> 37:55.105
-I mean, obviously, it worked.
-Yeah!

37:55.107 --> 37:56.606
I think they were doing
the right thing

37:56.608 --> 37:58.008
-with the iron spikes.
-Yeah.

37:58.010 --> 38:01.211
Like I think, kind of,
infusing something in here

38:01.213 --> 38:03.146
with, like, protective energy
is great,

38:03.148 --> 38:05.715
but I think it needs
to extend beyond these.

38:05.717 --> 38:08.385
They just need to amp it up
for the entire house.

38:08.387 --> 38:12.222
Yeah! I mean, I have an idea
for them tomorrow,

38:12.224 --> 38:15.191
so maybe we work
with them on that.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.027
Okay.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.963
<i> [Adam] We've seen this kind</i>
<i>  of character before.</i>

38:19.965 --> 38:22.165
<i>  We've encountered them</i>
<i>  in jails, in old schools,</i>

38:22.167 --> 38:24.100
<i>  and other houses,</i>

38:24.102 --> 38:26.303
and while it's disappointing
that we don't know who he is,

38:26.305 --> 38:28.071
I'm not disappointed,

38:28.073 --> 38:31.207
in the sense that we know
what he's up to.

38:31.209 --> 38:34.177
<i>  We've spoken to this entity,</i>
<i>  we know what he's about,</i>

38:34.179 --> 38:37.013
and we've been able
to tell him to back off

38:37.015 --> 38:38.782
and to leave guests alone.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.984
<i>  So, Amy and I are going</i>
<i>  to be guests tonight.</i>

38:40.986 --> 38:43.753
<i>  And we're, hopefully, going</i>
<i>  to have a really great sleep.</i>

38:43.755 --> 38:45.789
<i>  Because then,</i>
<i>  that just proves our point,</i>

38:45.791 --> 38:47.657
that we did make
a breakthrough

38:47.659 --> 38:50.126
with this aggressive entity.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.996
So, yeah, I guess I'll see
Winn and Josh in the morning,

38:52.998 --> 38:57.067
and Adam's in the next room
over, hopefully not snoring.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.036
Wish us luck! Good night!

39:10.048 --> 39:12.248
So your house is haunted.
I mean, for real haunted.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.050
Like, it's like
a haunted mansion.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.754
[Amy] You guys came to us
at the perfect time

39:17.756 --> 39:18.922
in what's going on here,

39:18.924 --> 39:20.156
because it absolutely
was something

39:20.158 --> 39:23.993
that could have progressed
to become much worse.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.562
The first night
that we investigated

39:25.564 --> 39:28.631
we heard this male voice.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.334
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  Whoever you are, can you tell</i>
<i>  me what your name is, please?</i>

39:31.336 --> 39:33.103
[loud noise]

39:35.207 --> 39:37.607
-Oh, my gosh!
-[Amy] Yeah, that's...

39:37.609 --> 39:39.275
I am like... [exhales]

39:39.711 --> 39:41.310
-[Winn] It's not a whisper.
-No.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.947
[Amy on the recorder]
<i>  I think I'm going to sleep</i>
<i>  in this room tomorrow.</i>

39:43.949 --> 39:47.250
<i>  It seems comfortable.</i>
<i>  Should I feel safe here?</i>

39:47.252 --> 39:50.053
-[loud noise]
<i> -[Amy on the recorder] Should</i>
<i>  everyone feel safe here?</i>

39:50.055 --> 39:52.021
-Oh, my goodness.
-[Amy and Adam] Yeah.

39:52.023 --> 39:55.125
It's just very gruff
and yelling and like,

39:55.127 --> 39:57.060
"No! You should not
feel safe here."

39:57.062 --> 39:58.628
You know,
it's very intimidating.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.232
But when we would go, like,
into your room

40:02.234 --> 40:03.867
with these up on the door,

40:03.869 --> 40:05.301
we realized
these were working.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.270
-Nothing was happening.
-[Adam] So good news.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.239
[Amy] So, then we came up
with this plan,

40:09.241 --> 40:12.008
where we took these down,
and get him to talk,

40:12.010 --> 40:13.309
so we would know where he was.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.578
And eventually,
we ended up in your room.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.948
That Adam put these
on your door.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.317
-To try to capture him inside?
-[Amy] To keep him in there.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.422
And it worked.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.324
So, we left him there.

40:28.326 --> 40:30.460
-You left him in my room?
-[Adam] Yeah.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.563
-We left him for the night.
-Good.

40:33.565 --> 40:37.834
He was basically upset
that now he is in this space,

40:37.836 --> 40:42.639
did not want to talk to us
or give us any answers
or names.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.308
So that's, kind of,
where these come into play.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.477
Because this has already
worked for you,

40:47.479 --> 40:48.745
and it's really
about intentions.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.448
And so, what we want to do
with these is,

40:51.450 --> 40:53.149
instead of putting them
over doorways,

40:53.151 --> 40:56.052
we want to bury them
in each corner of the house.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.187
So then that way,

40:57.189 --> 41:00.323
you have that
throughout your entire house.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.826
[Adam] This entity
may reach out again,

41:02.828 --> 41:06.796
and it's up to you
to also take charge.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.032
If you have guests coming,

41:09.034 --> 41:10.667
then maybe have
a conversation.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.802
Be like, "Hey, listen.
So, we have guests coming.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.038
They don't... They're not
into the paranormal.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.507
They're going to be here,
so kindly back off."

41:19.211 --> 41:20.310
I'm just blown away.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.579
I think that it seems
that it's, kind of, like,

41:22.581 --> 41:25.281
contained and corralled,
and we have a plan.

41:25.283 --> 41:29.152
Um, it makes me very excited
to be able to invite people

41:29.154 --> 41:32.121
to continue to be here,
and be curious about that,

41:32.123 --> 41:34.591
but to not be afraid, because
that was the whole point.

41:34.593 --> 41:37.093
I think it was really helpful
that, you know, Winn and Josh

41:37.095 --> 41:40.997
<i>  already knew that they had</i>
<i>  this kind of power</i>
<i>  at their hands,</i>

41:40.999 --> 41:44.601
with those iron stakes,
because they've been working
for them for so long.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.702
<i>  And I think</i>
<i>  that just telling them</i>

41:45.704 --> 41:47.871
that we were just going
to expand on that,

41:47.873 --> 41:51.174
<i>  and extend it</i>
<i>  through the entire house,</i>
<i>  made perfect sense to them.</i>

41:51.176 --> 41:53.977
And as long as they have
that faith in that process,

41:53.979 --> 41:55.612
it absolutely will work.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.347
-I see it!
-That is fabulous.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.282
-Nicely done!
-Thanks, guys!

41:59.284 --> 42:01.184
-I feel good about this.
-Good. I do, too!

42:01.186 --> 42:02.118
[Adam] Yeah!
