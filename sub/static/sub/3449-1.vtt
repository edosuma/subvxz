15:47.698 --> 15:49.950
All right. Sounds like a plan.

15:50.034 --> 15:51.493
- Let's do this.
- Oh, yeah.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.881
What! What!

16:04.173 --> 16:05.716

(PANTING)

16:29.323 --> 16:30.324
Fuck.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.410
- What'd you get?
- All this.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.955
You like? 'Cause it was, like, 25 bucks.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.832
Get out. That's a rip-off.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.752
Don't worry about it, honey.
It's on your credit card.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.713
Oh, yeah? Well, that's okay. You know why?

16:45.339 --> 16:46.340
Because...

16:47.549 --> 16:49.927
- Kenny paid for the gas.
- What?

16:50.302 --> 16:51.762
What the... Give me that.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.639
- How'd you get that, man?
- Oh, Kenny.

16:53.764 --> 16:56.934
RYAN: Don't cry.
NIKKI: It's okay. Let's go, baby.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.519

Jesus, dude, you all right?

17:09.988 --> 17:10.989
Oh, my God.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.083
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You hit him, Kenny.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.244
Sorry, I didn't see you, man.

17:16.328 --> 17:17.329
It's all right.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.208
I should probably sue.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.848
But I'll settle for a stick of that jerky.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.091
Say, where y'all headed?

17:29.633 --> 17:30.634
New Orleans.

You're kiddin'! That's great!

- That where you goin'?
- No, no.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.182
Shreveport? It's on the way.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.143
Did your car break? Where's your car?

17:39.810 --> 17:42.271
Uh, that's a bit of a long story.

17:42.688 --> 17:43.814
Short of it is

17:44.148 --> 17:47.151
my lady dumped my butt and I've been
thumbing my way back from Tulsa.

17:48.777 --> 17:49.778
I sure could use a ride.

Ain't got no problem paying my way.

- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah?

I'm just wondering where I fit, you know?

18:56.345 --> 18:57.429
Yeah.

We wouldn't be able to see anything.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.168
Hey, this is it.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.212
This is Homestead Road. Make a left.

- Wow.

all the way from Dallas.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.658
Anything for Verna.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.160
She was a good woman. Salt of the earth.

21:26.370 --> 21:29.498
Though not the most popular in these parts.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.876
I didn't know you were bringing friends.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.378
Is that okay?

21:35.796 --> 21:38.382
Well, it's your house, if you want it.

21:39.841 --> 21:40.884
Just so you know...

21:41.301 --> 21:43.720
Verna's trust forbids you from selling it.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.579
It's all described in these papers.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.432
Okay. Thanks.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.686
You can't quite see the house from here.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.189
But it's just up beyond those trees.

everything inside and out.

like that in my backyard.

Good to know.

Well, you best keep it down.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.276
I'd hate to have to haul you in.

32:36.706 --> 32:37.874
I'll try to behave.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.543
- How much is this?
- That'll be $9.

32:40.668 --> 32:41.948
So, whereabouts is this shindig?

32:44.130 --> 32:45.131
Homestead Road.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.135
Ain't nothing out there
but the old Carson place.

32:48.176 --> 32:49.177
That's the one.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.209
I thought that place was empty.

- Heather.
- Nice to meet you, Heather.

Now, my ears aren't what they used to be,

33:15.286 --> 33:16.647

33:16.704 --> 33:18.025
something about the Carson place.

33:18.706 --> 33:19.707
I inherited it.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.960
- You're a Carson?
- No.

- Yep.

- You knew her?
- Yeah.

Me and your family go way back.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.097
