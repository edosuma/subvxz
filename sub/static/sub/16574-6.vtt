00:48.333 --> 00:49.900
- Ah.
- What's this?

00:50.202 --> 00:52.669
I salvaged it from
the medistation, sir.

00:52.671 --> 00:54.637
It's a personality tuck machine.

00:54.639 --> 00:57.907
Mmm, so it can perform corrective
surgery on your character?

00:57.909 --> 01:04.114
Exactly. It scans the patient's
brain and forms a personality map.

01:04.116 --> 01:05.348
It's then able to
enhance, remove,

01:05.349 --> 01:09.486
even sculpt the very traits that
make that person who they are.

01:09.488 --> 01:13.123
Hypothetically... I'm
speaking hypothetically here,

01:13.125 --> 01:14.524
do you think I could do
with a little work?

01:14.526 --> 01:18.661
Take a seat, sir. I'll
cancel this week's schedule.

01:19.464 --> 01:20.830
So, what can you do
for me exactly?

01:20.832 --> 01:27.504
I'll begin by just working out the areas
I think we might be able to improve.

01:27.506 --> 01:30.507
Now here, here, here,

01:30.509 --> 01:33.109
here, here, definitely here.

01:33.111 --> 01:35.745
Yes, all right, Kryten,
get on with it, man.

01:35.747 --> 01:39.282
Well, take your pomposity,
large and unsightly.

01:39.284 --> 01:42.218
Your self-importance, too,
is massively engorged.

01:42.220 --> 01:44.587
What's that huge area
in the middle there?

01:44.589 --> 01:47.524
Well, that is
your cowardice, sir.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.560
Perhaps you'd like me
to perform a cowardectomy?

01:50.562 --> 01:54.397
What? Reduce it to sort of
wimp-o-plasty?

01:54.566 --> 01:55.532
Hey, what's happening, buds?

01:55.534 --> 01:59.636
I'm about to perform some
personality surgery on Mr Rimmer.

01:59.638 --> 02:03.673
He's getting a new personality?
Great idea.

02:03.675 --> 02:08.178
Not new, moulded,
tightened, lifted, shaped.

02:08.180 --> 02:09.145
This is gonna transform me.

02:09.146 --> 02:14.784
I'm gonna be the lady-melting enormous
bald stud muffin I've always dreamt of.

02:15.287 --> 02:18.288
Now, Kryten, one thing.
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

02:18.290 --> 02:19.355
There'll just be the slightest,

02:19.357 --> 02:22.625
- infinitesimally tiny little scratch.
- Scratch?

02:22.627 --> 02:25.094
- Well, when I insert the laser.
- Laser?

02:25.096 --> 02:26.162
- Well, it has to burn...
- Burn?

02:26.164 --> 02:29.432
Well, perhaps I should give
you a hollow sedative, sir.

02:29.434 --> 02:30.500
- With a needle?
- Sir, please.

02:30.502 --> 02:34.737
I'll talk you through every aspect
of the procedure step by step.

02:34.739 --> 02:38.508
Right now, I'm just in the...
Where, where's he gone?

02:38.510 --> 02:39.475
Out the door and left.

02:39.477 --> 02:45.081
Oh, Einstein was wrong. It is
possible to break the speed of light.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.499
What the...

03:03.501 --> 03:08.504
Guys? Keep the noise down,
I'm trying to sleep here.

03:10.642 --> 03:14.210
Whoa! What's going on?
We're way off course here.

03:14.212 --> 03:16.779
Who's the joker
in charge of navigation?

03:16.781 --> 03:18.181
You are, sir.

03:18.183 --> 03:23.119
Seriously? Oh, man.
I think I might've dosed off.

03:23.121 --> 03:24.387
Lister, we're 5,000 clicks
off course.

03:24.389 --> 03:28.591
All you had to do was engage autopilot.
Your watch, your fault.

03:28.593 --> 03:29.559
You can't blame me for this.

03:29.561 --> 03:31.761
What kind of lunch was that
to give your pilot?

03:31.763 --> 03:34.497
Roast beef with all the
trimmings, followed by seconds,

03:34.499 --> 03:37.300
followed by sticky toffee
pudding, followed by seconds,

03:37.302 --> 03:42.438
followed by beer and coffee and
cheese and brandy and port and cigars

03:42.440 --> 03:44.574
and that little chocolate mint.

03:44.576 --> 03:48.511
What chance did I stand after
a Sunday lunch like that?

03:48.513 --> 03:52.148
- How long have I been out?
- It's Monday, sir.

03:52.150 --> 03:52.682
Oh, man. No way.

03:52.684 --> 03:54.884
It's gonna take us forever
to get back to <i>Red Dwarf</i> now.

03:54.886 --> 03:59.489
Maybe we could take a short cut
across that asteroid belt.

03:59.491 --> 04:00.223
GELF country?

04:00.225 --> 04:01.357
If the stories are
to be believed,

04:01.359 --> 04:05.795
the particular tribe of GELF
that inhabit belt Juno 98

04:05.797 --> 04:09.532
are the...

04:09.534 --> 04:13.636
Oh, sorry. I just sat
down on a screwdriver.

04:13.638 --> 04:16.406
Why does nobody tidy up
around here except me?

04:16.408 --> 04:17.240
Kryten, you were saying?

04:17.242 --> 04:21.110
I'm sorry, sir, yes, that particular
tribe are the Nacky Ninckers.

04:21.112 --> 04:23.279
Vampire GELFs to you and me.

04:23.281 --> 04:23.846
Vampire GELFs?

04:23.848 --> 04:28.318
The story goes they feast
on the blood of virgins.

04:31.323 --> 04:33.089
Feast on the blood of virgins.

04:33.091 --> 04:34.390
Who believes that?
Taking her in.

04:34.392 --> 04:38.461
Wait a minute, hang on
here, slow the hell down.

04:38.463 --> 04:41.331
- What's the problem?
- I'm just curious.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.266
How do they tell the virgins
from the non-virgins?

04:43.268 --> 04:46.402
Well, according to the ancient
myths, they can smell them.

04:46.404 --> 04:50.406
Smell 'em? What the hell
does a virgin smell of?

04:50.408 --> 04:52.542
Desperation, normally.

04:54.713 --> 04:55.878
Actually, sir,
the actual science is

04:55.880 --> 05:00.550
that the GELFs can smell the
pheromone produced by fear.

05:00.552 --> 05:01.517
Only the virgins are scared,

05:01.519 --> 05:04.253
so they're the only ones
producing the fear pheromone.

05:04.255 --> 05:05.788
- Thus no issue for us.
- Taking her in.

05:05.790 --> 05:11.194
Hang on, hold up. Can we discuss
this for one stupid, lousy second?

05:11.196 --> 05:14.263
- Hang on a minute, are you...
- No.

05:14.265 --> 05:15.465
- I suppose you must...
- No!

05:15.467 --> 05:18.534
- I never really...
- Don't even say it.

05:19.170 --> 05:20.303
Okay. Moving on.

05:20.305 --> 05:22.505
Didn't mean to open up
a can of worms here.

05:22.507 --> 05:25.074
I've had my share,
let me tell ya.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.075
More than my share.

05:26.077 --> 05:28.711
Plus, I've had full blown
love affairs, too.

05:28.713 --> 05:30.646
Well, yes,
mirror in the bathroom,

05:30.648 --> 05:33.616
mirror in the hall...
I'd forgotten about those.

05:33.618 --> 05:37.286
Don't you guys know that
cats always have two homes?

05:37.288 --> 05:39.555
I got a lady cat
back on <i>Red Dwarf.</i>

05:39.557 --> 05:41.791
- Hell, I got two.
- On Zed deck.

05:41.793 --> 05:43.059
- On Zed deck.
- On Zed deck.

05:43.061 --> 05:45.395
Exactly. That's where
they are, on Zed deck.

05:45.397 --> 05:49.365
But hiding from you guys, because
they're only interested in me.

05:49.367 --> 05:50.733
We will go the long way 'round.

05:50.735 --> 05:57.073
And be quick about it, because I gotta
get back to my lady cats on Zed deck.

05:57.075 --> 06:01.310
I'm suddenly starting
to miss 'em real bad.

06:06.384 --> 06:08.418
I'm picking up a ship.

06:09.354 --> 06:11.487
The energy signature's
barely registering.

06:11.489 --> 06:15.224
The signal's weaker than
the San Marino reserve team.

06:15.226 --> 06:16.626
Posting, logging into
their mainframe.

06:16.628 --> 06:21.464
Don't bother, in this region of space,
it could well be a GELF battle cruiser.

06:21.466 --> 06:22.799
Maintain current course.

06:22.801 --> 06:23.599
That gets my vote.

06:23.601 --> 06:27.437
According to the hack, it's
a transport ship, crew two,

06:27.439 --> 06:29.672
one Mercenoid, one prisoner.

06:29.674 --> 06:30.406
A merce-what?

06:30.408 --> 06:34.076
A Mercenoid is a droid, sir, who
has agreed to sacrifice his life

06:34.078 --> 06:37.313
in exchange for software
updates in silicone heaven.

06:37.315 --> 06:41.317
These Mercenoids are nuttier
than a vegetarian breakfast.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.653
That probably explains why
the Mercenoid and his prisoner

06:43.655 --> 06:47.824
are on a death dive into the heart
of a super-massive black hole.

06:47.826 --> 06:48.524
So what now?

06:48.526 --> 06:52.628
We're gonna board that crate before
it passes the event horizon.

06:52.630 --> 06:53.830
Risk our necks for one prisoner?

06:53.832 --> 06:59.101
Rimmer, that prisoner might be
human, we can't just abandon them.

06:59.103 --> 06:59.769
Never say can't, Lister.

06:59.771 --> 07:02.238
You put your mind to it, there's
no limit to who you can abandon.

07:02.240 --> 07:07.376
All right, Cat, take her in.
Rimmer, lend me your Dictaphone.

07:07.378 --> 07:08.578
What, why?

07:08.580 --> 07:11.380
Because I've got an idea.

07:12.283 --> 07:16.586
Right. Come on, let's do this.

07:16.588 --> 07:19.088
Good luck, keep in touch.

07:29.267 --> 07:30.800
<i>More ship Intel
coming through via the hack.</i>

07:30.802 --> 07:37.240
<i>They were transporting scientific
equipment to a bio-station on Orta 15.</i>

07:37.242 --> 07:38.241
Something doesn't smell right.

07:38.243 --> 07:43.346
The ship's log's been deleted and the
black box has also been wiped clean.

07:43.781 --> 07:45.648
I'm not getting any pictures
from your head cam.

07:45.650 --> 07:49.051
<i>There must be some kind of
signal block in place.</i>

07:54.225 --> 07:55.491
How about now?

07:55.493 --> 07:57.793
Yes, getting pictures now.
What did you do?

07:57.795 --> 08:03.599
Oh, I just recalibrated the
fluctuation drive band signal.

08:03.601 --> 08:06.769
- Impressive.
- Thanks.

08:08.506 --> 08:09.472
You're not gonna like this,

08:09.474 --> 08:11.073
but I'm picking up something
in the movement tracker.

08:11.075 --> 08:16.712
Life signs, organic and part
organic, in corridor Beta 12.

08:16.714 --> 08:20.082
Where exactly in Beta 12?

08:20.084 --> 08:22.184
<i>At the south entrance.</i>

08:22.186 --> 08:23.019
That's where we are.

08:23.021 --> 08:25.721
Then you should be able to see them,
they're there right on top of you.

08:25.723 --> 08:28.224
They may be in the ceiling
or under the floor. Run!

08:28.226 --> 08:32.562
Go back, get out of there!
Move! Now! Forwards!

08:32.563 --> 08:34.697
<i>Not that way, the other way!</i>

08:34.698 --> 08:36.566
<i>No, the other way.</i>

08:36.568 --> 08:38.501
Lister, move!

08:38.635 --> 08:41.370
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:41.739 --> 08:43.339
Could these life signs...

08:43.341 --> 08:47.276
Could they,
by any chance, be us?

08:48.813 --> 08:51.080
Ah, yes, of course.

08:51.082 --> 08:53.849
Organic and part organic.
Yes, it's you.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.719
<i>They should warn you about
that in the instruction manual.</i>

08:56.721 --> 09:01.123
<i>Someone could come along and
make a right idiot of himself.</i>

09:01.225 --> 09:02.391
Ah, it does mention it.

09:02.393 --> 09:06.128
It's this bit here
in big red capitals.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.430
So easy to miss.

09:07.432 --> 09:12.234
I'm picking up EM emissions.
This way, sirs.

09:28.219 --> 09:32.288
I know you are here, humies.

09:32.690 --> 09:36.826
If you want to live,
you must leave.

09:36.828 --> 09:38.327
He's right.
I think we should go.

09:38.329 --> 09:42.331
- Sir...
- You haven't seen him. Okay.

09:42.333 --> 09:45.835
I wanna talk about your prisoner.
I wanna do a trade.

09:45.837 --> 09:48.638
- No trade.
- Let's talk.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.039
No talk.

09:50.041 --> 09:54.276
Now, take my advice and go.

09:55.647 --> 09:56.245
Leave.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.080
<i>Who's your prisoner
and what have they done?</i>

09:58.082 --> 10:01.651
That is my business, not yours.

10:01.653 --> 10:04.320
<i>You can trust
us, you really can.</i>

10:04.322 --> 10:08.290
<i>You will achieve
all your dreams.</i>

10:09.460 --> 10:12.094
<i>Size doesn't matter.</i>

10:14.699 --> 10:17.233
<i>You are very handsome.</i>

10:18.302 --> 10:20.503
<i>And women think
you're extremely attractive.</i>

10:20.505 --> 10:22.571
Actually,
that's not really true,

10:22.573 --> 10:27.610
so drop your weapon
and turn round slowly.

10:46.698 --> 10:50.132
Head count down, what's going on?
Are you okay?

10:50.134 --> 10:53.169
We're fine, sir.
Mercenoid down.

10:53.171 --> 10:58.741
I think I've located the
prisoner, up two floors, bay 12.

11:09.687 --> 11:13.422
Buds, am I pleased to see you.

11:18.463 --> 11:21.530
- Wait, are you...
- Are you?

11:21.532 --> 11:25.167
- Ow.
- Ow.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.774
- You got a name?
- Sure I do, stupid.

11:31.776 --> 11:35.811
- Who doesn't have a name?
- Ow.

11:36.514 --> 11:39.548
Incidentally that's mine,
that's mine,

11:39.550 --> 11:43.285
that's mine, that's mine,
all this is mine.

11:43.287 --> 11:47.256
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What about that bit?

11:47.258 --> 11:49.625
That's mine, too.

11:49.694 --> 11:52.128
Ow!

11:55.099 --> 11:57.767
This is mine,
that's mine, this is mine.

11:57.769 --> 12:01.337
Basically, all of this is mine.
Even that bit.

12:01.339 --> 12:02.505
- What about that bit?
- Mine.

12:02.507 --> 12:06.542
- And that?
- Mine. And that bit, all mine.

12:06.544 --> 12:07.676
Look, we'll catch
you guys later.

12:07.678 --> 12:12.081
Hey, why don't we meet up later
on the pretext of having dinner,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.583
but instead
play the string game?

12:14.585 --> 12:16.418
I love the string game.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.186
- Ow!
- Ow!

12:17.188 --> 12:21.223
Ow. Hey? You bring you,
I'll bring the string.

12:21.225 --> 12:22.358
See you at 8:00.

12:22.360 --> 12:27.463
If you'd like to follow me, ma'am,
I'll show you to your quarters.

12:28.199 --> 12:29.865
Ow!

12:29.867 --> 12:32.101
Ow!

12:39.243 --> 12:42.111
Whoa, Kryten.
What's the big emergency?

12:42.113 --> 12:43.646
Extremely disturbing news, sir.

12:43.648 --> 12:45.781
According to the
Mercenoid's black box,

12:45.783 --> 12:51.654
that cat we brought on <i>Red
Dwarf</i> is not a felis sapien.

12:51.656 --> 12:53.856
It's not a cat.
What is it, then?

12:53.858 --> 12:55.558
It's a Polymorph, sir.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.794
A Polymorph that's shape
shifted into a felis sapien?

12:58.796 --> 13:00.896
- Precisely.
- That's why the Mercenoid

13:00.898 --> 13:02.097
was flying into that black hole.

13:02.099 --> 13:04.333
It was the only way he could
ensure the Polymorph's death.

13:04.335 --> 13:08.838
And we killed the Mercenoid, saved the
Polymorph and brought it on board ship.

13:08.840 --> 13:14.476
Our nomination for JMC crew of the
year is starting to look unlikely.

13:14.478 --> 13:19.715
Those damn space monkeys from the
<i>Omega 4</i> are gonna get it again.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.451
And another thing,
according to the black box,

13:22.453 --> 13:25.421
the Polymorph is carrying eggs.

13:25.423 --> 13:26.488
Eggs that hatch?

13:26.490 --> 13:29.124
No, Kinder eggs.

13:29.193 --> 13:31.360
Of course eggs that hatch.

13:31.362 --> 13:32.328
Okay, when will they hatch?

13:32.330 --> 13:36.465
Soon after a mum has found a
host body to deposit them in.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.635
I don't know if I wanna
know this but, um, explain.

13:39.637 --> 13:43.839
Well, I found a genetic mutant
documentary on RedNet.

13:43.841 --> 13:46.408
I was about to watch it.

13:46.410 --> 13:52.181
<i>Evening falls and
the impregnated female Polymorph</i>

13:52.183 --> 13:54.850
<i>seduces a passing organism</i>

13:54.852 --> 13:57.319
<i>by appearing to be his mate</i>

13:57.321 --> 14:00.222
<i>and secretly deposits her eggs</i>

14:00.224 --> 14:02.758
<i>in the unlucky host's body.</i>

14:02.760 --> 14:05.094
- Where's the Cat?
- What's the time?

14:05.096 --> 14:06.395
Oh, he's on his date
with the Polymorph.

14:17.389 --> 14:18.855
<i>♪ Seemed so wrong</i>

14:18.857 --> 14:21.324
<i>♪ But now it seems so right</i>

14:21.326 --> 14:25.395
<i>♪ What a lady, what a night ♪</i>

14:33.104 --> 14:34.737
Did you sleep with her?
What happened?

14:34.739 --> 14:36.406
Hey, I ain't kissing
and telling.

14:36.408 --> 14:40.877
I've had enough kissing for
one night, let me tell ya.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.845
You don't understand,
we need to know.

14:42.847 --> 14:46.849
All I'm saying is that she had
some moves you'd never even seen.

14:46.851 --> 14:48.851
- Like what?
- Like when you're rolling around

14:48.853 --> 14:52.221
making out,
then the next thing you know,

14:52.223 --> 14:56.392
her big pipe thing
shoots out of her back,

14:56.394 --> 14:59.228
hovers above you
like a crazy snake,

14:59.230 --> 15:03.266
then whooshes straight
down your throat. Whoo!

15:03.268 --> 15:07.103
Man, I was like...

15:07.105 --> 15:10.073
Cat, women don't have
a big pipe thing.

15:10.075 --> 15:10.873
Not for you maybe.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.377
But if you drive 'em crazy by
blowing on their antennas...

15:14.379 --> 15:15.979
What antennas?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.047
Boom, out it comes.

15:18.049 --> 15:18.881
Then what happened?

15:18.883 --> 15:23.019
The usual, she just released her
gushy tadpole stuff down her pipe.

15:23.021 --> 15:26.689
Then afterwards, she said
she'd never been with anyone

15:26.691 --> 15:28.791
who could hold so many eggs.

15:28.793 --> 15:30.960
I don't know
what the hell she meant,

15:30.962 --> 15:34.097
but I think it meant I did good.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.799
See you in the morning, buds.

15:36.801 --> 15:39.035
<i>♪ Oh, what a night</i>

15:39.037 --> 15:42.305
<i>♪ Why'd it take so long
to see the... ♪</i>

15:42.307 --> 15:43.873
Just listen to me.

15:43.875 --> 15:47.710
How do I break this to you?
You're a moron!

15:47.712 --> 15:51.114
Oh, Rimmer. Go easy on him.
Let me handle this.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.049
Cat man, you're a moron!

15:53.051 --> 15:57.253
Sir, that wasn't a woman.
It wasn't a felis sapien, sir.

15:57.255 --> 15:59.822
- It was a shape shifter.
- A what?

15:59.824 --> 16:01.858
It wasn't a cat,
it wasn't a woman,

16:01.860 --> 16:08.398
you just had sex with a genetically
engineered insectoid arachnid.

16:09.901 --> 16:11.968
It still counts.

16:13.738 --> 16:15.438
C'mon.

16:16.441 --> 16:18.474
It counts.

16:18.710 --> 16:21.077
Why doesn't it count?

16:22.313 --> 16:24.447
I'm counting it.

16:33.324 --> 16:34.023
Let me tell you,

16:34.025 --> 16:37.260
she looked a hell of a lot
better last night.

16:41.499 --> 16:44.067
Its life cycle complete,
it's died,

16:44.069 --> 16:46.502
as the female Polymorph
often does

16:46.504 --> 16:48.037
after the exhaustive process

16:48.039 --> 16:52.241
of depositing her morphlings
into a host body.

16:52.243 --> 16:53.242
Depositing her what into what?

16:53.244 --> 16:57.513
Sir, we need to get you to the science
room and give you a full medical.

16:57.515 --> 16:59.215
Morphling?
What's a morphling?

16:59.217 --> 17:00.283
- We'll tell you later.
- Eh?

17:00.285 --> 17:03.753
When you're securely strapped
to a medi-bed.

17:04.222 --> 17:06.021
Just to explain
the ultrasound, sir,

17:06.023 --> 17:08.523
the probe sends a pulse
through your skin

17:08.526 --> 17:11.794
and into your body,
and the echo bounces back,

17:11.796 --> 17:15.164
which allows us to make sure
that everything is...

17:15.165 --> 17:17.165
Oh, my God.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.435
Hey, what the hell's happening?

17:19.436 --> 17:21.871
We're just checking, sir.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.906
How many are there?

17:24.909 --> 17:26.675
One, two, three, four.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.745
What about them two?
Five, six.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.747
And those down there
are seven, eight.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.316
- We've gotta tell him.
- So tell him.

17:33.318 --> 17:36.786
- Er, better coming from Kryten.
- Why me?

17:36.788 --> 17:38.087
Because you've got
a better bedside manner

17:38.089 --> 17:42.692
when it comes to telling patients
they're raddled with Polymorphs.

17:42.694 --> 17:46.362
Hey, hey, what are you saying?
Are you talking about me?

17:46.364 --> 17:49.098
Sir, I have some bad news.

17:49.100 --> 17:52.435
You are pregnant
with eight Polymorph eggs.

17:52.437 --> 17:56.806
When they hatch, they will
literally burst out of you

17:56.808 --> 17:59.709
using the nearest orifice
available.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.846
You mean rather than forming
an orderly queue?

18:04.783 --> 18:05.715
What the hell we gonna do?

18:05.717 --> 18:08.117
First, I think it's essential
that you eat something, sir.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.686
You've got to have all your
strength to fight against them.

18:10.688 --> 18:14.791
They're currently depriving your
body of many essential vitamins.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.059
I can't eat at a time like this.

18:17.061 --> 18:18.394
Sir, you must try.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.463
I just want these things
out of me.

18:20.465 --> 18:23.132
Have you thought about
a caesarean?

18:23.368 --> 18:25.468
- Okay.
- Are you sure?

18:25.470 --> 18:28.204
Yeah, but no croutons.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.008
It's not a salad, you gimboid.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.777
It's an operation where
they laser open your abdomen.

18:34.779 --> 18:37.413
I think it's your only chance
of survival, sir.

18:37.415 --> 18:40.216
Hey, there's no way...

18:40.218 --> 18:44.253
Thank God I didn't have
that cowardectomy.

18:44.422 --> 18:46.489
We need to sedate him somehow.

18:46.491 --> 18:48.858
Wise words, sir.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.696
Well, at least that's
bought us some time.

18:53.698 --> 18:57.066
We just need to get cleaned up
and do this.

18:57.068 --> 18:57.834
Scalpel.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.002
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

19:03.074 --> 19:07.944
Has someone been playing around
with the settings on this thing?

19:08.813 --> 19:10.146
Oh.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.415
Right. I'm going in.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.051
Hang on, look at the scanner.

19:17.088 --> 19:19.222
The morphlings are going crazy.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.189
What are they turning into?

19:20.191 --> 19:23.092
Tumours. They know we're
trying to extract them early

19:23.094 --> 19:25.895
and they're fighting
fire with fire.

19:25.897 --> 19:28.798
We kill them, they kill him.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.365
What do we do?

19:29.367 --> 19:31.367
We have to let them be born
in the normal way.

19:31.369 --> 19:35.805
Do you mean normal as in shooting out
of every orifice simultaneously?

19:35.807 --> 19:39.709
It'll be a bit like me
after a dodgy egg bhuna.

20:04.269 --> 20:07.436
They're assuming the
shapes of household objects

20:07.438 --> 20:09.839
and trying to blend in.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.952
Oh, we've got a wriggler.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.868
Oh, it's gonna be so hard

20:38.870 --> 20:42.138
flushing this lot into deep space.
They're so cute.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.839
Sir, it's their
defence mechanism.

20:43.841 --> 20:46.809
They're trying to avoid
being flushed into space.

20:46.811 --> 20:49.912
Look, there's a chinchilla
with a pink hat

20:49.914 --> 20:52.148
and a hamster on a skateboard.

20:52.150 --> 20:55.351
Those Dalmatian
puppies, look at them.

20:55.353 --> 20:57.920
And like a hedgehog
in a top hat,

20:57.922 --> 21:01.090
sitting inside a
mini shopping trolley.

21:01.159 --> 21:01.557
Aw.

21:01.559 --> 21:03.893
Sirs, they are doing this on
purpose to make us feel guilty.

21:03.895 --> 21:07.763
You must remember what they're going
to turn into when they reach maturity.

21:07.765 --> 21:10.733
I mean, most things look adorable
when they're first born,

21:10.735 --> 21:15.037
even velociraptors,
even The Rolling Stones.

21:15.039 --> 21:20.242
- So cute.
- Sir, they're evil genetic mutants.

21:22.981 --> 21:23.846
I should flush 'em.

21:23.848 --> 21:28.818
I got us into this mess, I should
be the one to get us out of it.

21:28.820 --> 21:29.485
Are you sure?

21:29.487 --> 21:32.221
I just wanna have a minute
to say goodbye.

21:32.223 --> 21:34.390
We'll be just round
the corner, sir.

21:34.392 --> 21:37.393
Oh, look at that one.
That one is cute.

21:37.395 --> 21:38.928
Sir...

21:48.873 --> 21:50.840
How long's he gonna be?

21:50.842 --> 21:52.975
He's gone! Oh, why didn't
I anticipate this?

21:52.977 --> 21:58.180
He's been affected by the oxytocin
hormone released by the morphlings.

21:58.182 --> 21:59.181
- The what?
- It's a hormone

21:59.183 --> 22:02.018
that the morphlings excrete to
ensure their hosts look after them

22:02.020 --> 22:06.822
until they're strong enough to
stand on their own six suckers.

22:06.824 --> 22:10.126
- And then devour his emotions.
- Precisely.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.294
We've gotta find him.

22:13.698 --> 22:17.166
We have to narrow down
the search somehow.

22:17.168 --> 22:17.967
I've got an idea.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.903
Turn off all the heat in the ship
apart from in the diesel decks,

22:20.905 --> 22:24.073
- so it'll drive him down there.
- And then what?

22:24.075 --> 22:25.041
Track them down undetected.

22:25.043 --> 22:29.078
They are Polymorphs, they feed off
emotions, they will sense us.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.150
Not if one of us has got no emotions
as they've had them all removed.

22:34.152 --> 22:34.717
Hey?

22:34.719 --> 22:39.355
Listy, if you have a personality tuck
to remove your emotions, we're sorted.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.890
That stupid tuck machine?
Why me?

22:40.892 --> 22:44.460
Kryten's the only one who knows how
to operate it, so it can't be him.

22:44.462 --> 22:46.729
It can't be me obviously,
that leaves you.

22:46.731 --> 22:48.097
- Why can't it be you?
- Don't interrupt.

22:48.099 --> 22:53.436
Then after the tuck, you'll be able to
walk amongst the morphlings undetected.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.403
They feed on human emotions.

22:54.405 --> 22:57.073
And if you've got no emotions,
they won't know you're there.

22:57.075 --> 23:00.076
And what will happen
to my emotions?

23:00.078 --> 23:01.377
We'll just download your brain.

23:01.379 --> 23:05.114
Kryten, have a five-megabyte
memory stick on standby.

23:05.116 --> 23:06.182
Will do, sir.

23:06.184 --> 23:09.251
Oh, I'm not sure about this.

23:12.757 --> 23:15.057
Ah, you're done. Excellent.

23:15.059 --> 23:17.860
I haven't started yet, sir.

23:18.229 --> 23:19.862
Mr Lister?

23:19.864 --> 23:21.730
Sorry, I was miles away.

23:21.732 --> 23:22.898
Are you ready, sir?

23:22.900 --> 23:24.934
Yeah, c'mon, let's do it.

23:46.190 --> 23:49.291
- Let's send him in, then get this done.
- Ah...

23:49.293 --> 23:51.360
- What?
- Well, according to the tracker,

23:51.362 --> 23:53.963
we are now completely
surrounded by life forms.

23:53.965 --> 23:59.235
Morphlings appear to have reached full
maturation quicker than expected.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.069
But what about the cat?

24:00.071 --> 24:02.004
Does that mean they've already
scoffed all his emotions?

24:02.006 --> 24:05.508
Well, according to the tracker,
there are nine life forms.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.176
He's still alive, but barely.

24:07.178 --> 24:09.245
Living in an
emotionless semi-state,

24:09.247 --> 24:11.313
his mind almost totally blank.

24:11.315 --> 24:13.382
No change there, then.

24:13.885 --> 24:16.318
But with each Polymorph
we eliminate, sir,

24:16.320 --> 24:18.988
part of the Cat's personality
will return.

24:18.990 --> 24:23.859
Hey, buds, I need a hand here.
I'm busted up really bad.

24:26.264 --> 24:30.199
- How did you know that wasn't the Cat?
- I didn't.

24:30.201 --> 24:33.969
- So why did you shoot him?
- Why not?

24:34.405 --> 24:36.071
Help me.

24:36.707 --> 24:37.940
What's wrong with him?

24:37.942 --> 24:39.008
He's got no emotions, sir.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.477
We've turned him into
a dehumanised assassin.

24:41.479 --> 24:46.949
- So what should we do?
- May I suggest, sir, run mode.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.732
Oh, oh, there you are, sir.

25:03.734 --> 25:05.768
I fear Mr Lister
may be a Polymorph.

25:05.770 --> 25:10.306
That's how he was able to detect the
other Polymorphs and kill them.

25:10.308 --> 25:11.307
Why would he be killing them?

25:11.309 --> 25:12.975
Oh, they're known for
killing each other, sir.

25:12.977 --> 25:15.711
That way, there's more food
for the victor.

25:15.713 --> 25:18.113
We can't trust anyone.

25:18.115 --> 25:20.249
So how can I trust you?

25:20.251 --> 25:22.785
Well, er, how can I trust you?

25:22.787 --> 25:26.121
And how can I trust
either of you?

25:26.123 --> 25:27.289
How many are left?

25:27.291 --> 25:28.090
Mmm, make it six.

25:28.092 --> 25:31.860
Six, yeah, that's right.
And he could be one of them.

25:31.862 --> 25:34.196
- I'm not a Polymorph.
- Neither am I.

25:34.198 --> 25:34.897
Nor me.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.498
What do we do?
Why am I asking you?

25:36.500 --> 25:39.468
Because I'm not a Polymorph,
but you might be.

25:39.470 --> 25:40.202
So might you.

25:40.204 --> 25:42.238
Right, how about we go down
to the science room

25:42.240 --> 25:46.141
and X-ray each other.
That way we can be sure.

25:46.143 --> 25:48.077
Good idea.

25:55.219 --> 25:59.888
After you,
after you, after you...

26:05.296 --> 26:07.229
This is a nightmare.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.968
For crying out loud, isn't
this hard enough already?

26:12.970 --> 26:16.872
Let's get to the science room
and X-ray one another.

26:16.874 --> 26:20.943
Hey, guys! They had me
tied up, but I got away.

26:20.945 --> 26:21.744
What's happening?

26:21.746 --> 26:25.014
There are six Polymorphs here
and we don't know who's who.

26:25.016 --> 26:29.818
Ah, I'm sure you'll work it out.
Catch you later. Ow!

26:32.456 --> 26:35.090
Let's get to the lift.

26:56.013 --> 26:58.414
How did you know who was who?

26:58.416 --> 27:01.483
A mamma always knows her kids.

27:10.394 --> 27:12.194
It's me. Can I come in?

27:12.196 --> 27:13.662
I'm trying to sleep, bud.

27:13.664 --> 27:17.800
Cat, I just wanted to talk to you
about that thing that you're not.

27:17.802 --> 27:23.672
I mean, I know you're not, you know
you're not, we both know you're not.

27:23.674 --> 27:25.708
- Because I'm not.
- Exactly.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.476
But if you were,
which you're not,

27:27.478 --> 27:29.712
it wouldn't mean that
you were a loser,

27:29.714 --> 27:31.013
it wouldn't mean that
you weren't cool.

27:31.015 --> 27:33.215
It would just mean that you
hadn't met the right girl yet.

27:33.217 --> 27:34.917
- But I'm not.
- Exactly.

27:34.919 --> 27:37.252
- So no need to have this talk.
- Exactly.

27:37.254 --> 27:40.356
- So go away.
- I'm gone.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.198
Man, is he annoying.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.033
So damn patronising.

27:51.035 --> 27:53.502
Don't he know a cat
always has two homes?

27:53.504 --> 27:57.239
I tried to tell him,
but he won't listen.

27:57.241 --> 27:58.107
Hey, it's late.

27:58.109 --> 28:03.479
We keep talking and there ain't
gonna be much time for loving.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.447
This is a dream, isn't it?

28:05.883 --> 28:10.753
But look on the bright side,
you haven't woke up yet.

28:11.021 --> 28:14.022
Let's go, pipe me!

28:14.158 --> 28:18.660

there's no kind of atmosphere</i>
