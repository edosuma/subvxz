00:37.878 --> 00:41.883

00:42.551 --> 00:45.428
my first novel.

00:55.232 --> 00:58.485
Sorry.

00:58.485 --> 00:59.737
Oh, shit.

01:04.785 --> 01:08.079
Mr. David.

01:10.041 --> 01:11.960
Hey.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.253
You're having a nightmare.

01:14.045 --> 01:15.589
You okay?

01:16.674 --> 01:17.842
Yeah, yeah.

01:18.634 --> 01:20.093
-Okay. -I'm sorry.

01:20.093 --> 01:21.637
That's okay.

02:27.965 --> 02:31.260
That's really good.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.346
Yeah. I know. I'm married to J.M.

02:33.346 --> 02:36.180
I didn't know he was gay.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.394
He's not-- I mean, she's not. She's a... She's a woman.

02:38.394 --> 02:41.187
And she's my wife.

02:41.187 --> 02:43.191
I thought... I'm sorry. I thought that J.M.

02:43.775 --> 02:46.277
was a man's name.

02:47.194 --> 02:48.698
No. It's... The J is Jennifer.

02:48.698 --> 02:51.993
Uh, you know, if you look in the back of the book jacket, there's a...

02:52.284 --> 02:55.204
photo there.

02:55.664 --> 02:56.540
I-I had a Kindle version. So I didn't...

02:56.540 --> 02:59.001
Um, I should go get a seat.

02:59.001 --> 03:02.212
Right.

03:02.212 --> 03:03.213
Congratulations.

03:03.213 --> 03:04.591
Thank you.

03:04.591 --> 03:05.926
-Hi. -Hey.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.346
So good to see you. Hey, I brought you something.

03:09.346 --> 03:11.474
Uh, can you hold on to that?

03:11.474 --> 03:14.186
-Yeah. -Um, my publishe's here.

03:14.186 --> 03:15.813
-Let me introduce you. -All right.

03:15.813 --> 03:18.190
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.234
I wanted to introduce you to my husband.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.655
David Warwik. He's also a writer.

03:23.655 --> 03:25.824
My condolences.

03:25.824 --> 03:27.201
This is my wife, Lily.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.662
Two writers, one marriage.

03:30.246 --> 03:31.789
That must be quite the adventure.

03:31.789 --> 03:34.249
How do you manage those imaginations?

03:34.249 --> 03:36.420
-Oh, it's fine. We were just... -Prozac.

03:37.045 --> 03:38.589
Uh, why don't you tell them about your work, David?

03:41.258 --> 03:45.097
Sure. I'm making a transition from

03:45.639 --> 03:49.267
short stories to my first novel.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.813
Um, David had a piece in The New Yorker about the man with HPV.

03:52.396 --> 03:56.275
I didn't know that men could get HPV.

03:56.275 --> 03:58.320
Oh, yes. It's very common.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.240
-What are it's symptoms? -Warts.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.159
That's terrible.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.283
Do you have HPV, David?

04:03.283 --> 04:05.078
No, no. No, no. It's just a work of fiction.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.167
It's not... It's not about me.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.292
I mean, you're not the first person though,

04:11.292 --> 04:12.712
to assume that I have genital warts.

04:16.175 --> 04:19.553
Um, David is writing a book that is just exquisite.

04:20.180 --> 04:23.892
It's a... It's a coming-of-age tale,

04:23.892 --> 04:27.437
sort of, semi autobiographical--

04:27.730 --> 04:31.567
-Hi. -We're about to start, J.M., so...

04:31.567 --> 04:33.821
-Okay. Great. -We should go take our seats.

04:33.821 --> 04:36.157
Great. Great.

04:36.157 --> 04:37.867
Very nice to meet you.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.118
Yeah, if you could please help me in welcoming

04:40.703 --> 04:42.872
the head of Fallon Fremont press,

04:42.872 --> 04:45.042
Bernard Geist.

04:47.335 --> 04:50.631
Thank you.

04:50.631 --> 04:52.425
It is my pleasure to be here tonight to introduce to you

04:52.425 --> 04:55.179
one of the most exciting and innovative young author's of our time.

04:57.223 --> 05:00.059
Her latest work is

05:00.476 --> 05:02.896
unique, fascinating, and seductive.

05:05.356 --> 05:07.568
Please welcome J.M. Lee.

05:15.578 --> 05:19.790
Hello. Thank you, Bernard, for such a beautiful introduction.

05:19.957 --> 05:23.628
I'm going to be reading an excerpt

05:23.628 --> 05:26.464
from the first chapter of my book,

05:26.464 --> 05:28.382
Blind Hearts.

05:29.218 --> 05:33.015
"It had been the longest night of the year.

05:33.015 --> 05:35.391
It was one of those nights when the dawn never seemed to come.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.063
It was almost..."

06:00.922 --> 06:04.425
-Ready to go? -Yeah.

06:04.425 --> 06:06.262
Oh, hey. I stole a bottle of wine. Check it out.

06:06.262 --> 06:08.640
My God. Why do you do that?

06:08.640 --> 06:10.642
You always do that. It's so weird.

06:10.642 --> 06:12.018
They're not gonna miss it. Come on, you got it.

06:12.018 --> 06:14.021
Well, that was wonderful.

06:14.021 --> 06:15.437
I can't wait to read the new book.

06:15.437 --> 06:18.318
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

06:18.318 --> 06:20.362
Uh, Jennifer, did you get the invitation to our salon tomorrow night?

06:21.196 --> 06:24.866
I'm so sorry. But I have this deadline

06:24.866 --> 06:26.786
and I just doubt that I'm gonna make it.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.120
Your'e my newest author, I insist you come.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.997
Oh, no. We invite all our favorite artists.

06:29.997 --> 06:32.457
You have to come and read your work.

06:32.457 --> 06:34.878
-David, you should read something too. -Huh?

06:35.087 --> 06:37.924
Well, it's settled then.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.051
-We'll see you tomorrow. -Okay. See you tomorrow.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.470
What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you drunk?

06:43.470 --> 06:46.475
-Hey. -Hey.

06:46.475 --> 06:47.935
-Rock star. -Oh, God.

06:47.935 --> 06:49.896
-Great job tonight. -Thank you. Thanks.

06:49.896 --> 06:52.481
-You're like your own muse. -Oh, my God.

06:52.481 --> 06:55.484
David, do you remember Jordan, my agent?

06:55.484 --> 06:57.029
Of course. Hey, man, how's it going?

06:57.029 --> 06:58.488
Hey. So, Jenny, you know Sawyer?

06:58.488 --> 06:59.907
Yes. Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

06:59.907 --> 07:02.411
You too. When you're done with Jordan, you should call me.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.495
-Oh, God. -Maybe I will.

07:04.495 --> 07:08.126
All right. well. We got to head out.

07:08.126 --> 07:10.295
-Okay. Yeah. -But you...

07:10.295 --> 07:12.755
You keep on living the way you love.

07:12.755 --> 07:14.506
All right? And love the way you live, because it looks good.

07:14.506 --> 07:17.970
-Hell, yeah, man. -Is that a Maroon 5 lyric?

07:17.970 --> 07:19.889
-Oh, yeah. Okay. -We'll see you soon, guys.

07:19.889 --> 07:22.351
That was Sawyer Edwards.

07:23.352 --> 07:24.686
She's, like, huge.

07:24.686 --> 07:27.273
Big time lit agent.

07:27.273 --> 07:29.359
I think she's bipolar though.

07:29.359 --> 07:31.526
She tried to light people on fire at this writer's retreat.

07:32.237 --> 07:35.992
I didn't get the vibe, though, did you?

07:35.992 --> 07:37.827
No.

07:38.036 --> 07:39.370
-You were great tonight. -Oh, thank you.

07:41.538 --> 07:43.917
Your agent's an asshole.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.045
-Ugh! No, he's not. -He treats me like I'm invisible.

07:46.045 --> 07:47.880
David, you need to learn how to play the game a little.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.425
You know, no publisher's gonna wanna read your book

07:50.425 --> 07:53.053
if you don't have an agent and they've never met you before.

07:53.053 --> 07:55.306
I don't wanna play a game. I just wanna work.

07:55.306 --> 07:58.558
I guess all I wanna do... I just wanna write.

07:58.558 --> 08:00.395
Why can't I just do that?

08:00.395 --> 08:01.688
Because networking is part of the work.

08:01.688 --> 08:04.816
You know what I mean?

08:04.816 --> 08:06.444
-Look-- -It just is.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.737
Look, I'm not a schmoozer, okay?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.238
I don't want to schmooze to get somebody to read me.

08:09.238 --> 08:12.826
I mean, that's not what being what a writer is.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.287
Was T.S. Elliot a schmoozer?

08:15.287 --> 08:16.372
T.S. Elliot? T.S. Elliot was a Nazi sympathizer.

08:16.372 --> 08:19.625
Okay, so he was a schmoozer of a different kind.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.505
-Yeah. -Like James Baldwin?

08:22.505 --> 08:23.838
Uh-huh. James Baldwin was a room mate of Marlon Brando.

08:23.838 --> 08:26.717
So he didn't need to schmooze.

08:26.717 --> 08:28.512
Look, just read a little bit from your book tomorrow at the salon

08:28.512 --> 08:31.264
and it will be a chance for Bernard to hear your work.

08:31.264 --> 08:33.599
I can't. You have your deadline. I can't go do to that by myself.

08:33.599 --> 08:36.727
No. It's fine. I'll rent a car and I'll blow off the deadline on it.

08:36.727 --> 08:39.190
As long as you promise to read a little bit and just...

08:39.190 --> 08:41.527
Just... No more, just a little bit.

08:41.527 --> 08:44.863
-And don't be weird. Don't steal wine. -I won't.

08:44.863 --> 08:47.615
-Promise? -I promise?

08:47.615 --> 08:49.077
I won't be weird.

08:49.077 --> 08:49.994
You're making that face though.

08:49.994 --> 08:51.372
No, I won't. I won't.

08:51.372 --> 08:52.456
You're gonna be weird. You're gonna be weird.

08:52.456 --> 08:54.623
I'm not. I'm not. Thank you.

08:54.623 --> 08:56.877
-I won't be weird. -Mm-hmm.

09:18.651 --> 09:22.366
Any interest in a quickie?

10:01.745 --> 10:05.458
David! Let's go!

10:05.458 --> 10:08.211
Can you grab the snacks and the wine on the counter?

10:09.086 --> 10:11.465
Yeah.

10:23.812 --> 10:27.733
Want me to get you a pen so you can sign her book?

10:30.820 --> 10:34.408
Can't believe we had to come all the way out to Queens just to get a car.

10:34.408 --> 10:37.954
I know. There are no cars by us.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.830
It's fine. We're just gonna transfer here and it's like three stops away.

10:46.089 --> 10:47.382
We've Uber-ed here to get to a car.

10:55.349 --> 10:58.768
Where's the wine?

10:58.768 --> 11:00.313
In the bag.

11:00.313 --> 11:01.898
No. No, no. No. The Pellegrin is in the bag.

11:01.898 --> 11:05.152
Shit.

11:05.152 --> 11:06.112
Look. we'll just pick up some wine.

11:06.112 --> 11:07.446
We'll find a wine shop and pick up some wine.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.241
But we're so late. Give me your phone. I'll find a wine shop.

11:09.782 --> 11:12.202
You should really get your own phone at this point.

11:13.829 --> 11:15.788
I'm... David, I'm never getting my own phone.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.460
Never.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.476
Um...

11:32.476 --> 11:34.312
Hello.

11:35.271 --> 11:36.606
-Hello. -Hi.

11:37.315 --> 11:38.650
Hi. I rented a car. The Honda?

11:40.235 --> 11:41.611
Um...

11:44.532 --> 11:45.491
Yeah. That's not here. Sorry.

11:48.036 --> 11:49.912
What do you mean?

11:49.912 --> 11:51.707
I reserved it.

11:51.707 --> 11:53.459
Oh, yeah. I mean, the other person didn't bring it back yet though. So...

11:53.459 --> 11:56.253
Okay.

11:56.253 --> 11:57.714
Uh, we'll share.

11:57.714 --> 11:59.591
Is there, I don't know, a different car that we can take?

12:00.718 --> 12:02.969
No. Sorry.

12:03.844 --> 12:06.098
You called me wheel chair?

12:06.767 --> 12:07.849
No. I called you we'll share.

12:07.849 --> 12:10.354
Okay, what are we @supposed to do?

12:10.354 --> 12:11.855
-Oh, it's wheel share. So it's a car sharing service. -Uh-huh.

12:11.855 --> 12:14.857
So you have to wait for the, uh, last person to bring the car back.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.862
Yeah, when are they coming back?

12:18.862 --> 12:20.491
Oh, I don't know.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.826
You don't know?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.078
Jen, it will be all right. whoever's got the car right now,

12:24.078 --> 12:26.955
they're getting fined for being late.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.084
-Hi. -Hi.

12:30.377 --> 12:31.754
Okay, so there's a package in my car that says bees on it.

12:33.004 --> 12:35.007
Does it say live bees?

12:36.593 --> 12:38.219
No. Just says bees.

12:38.969 --> 12:40.931
Then you're fine.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.562
I can't believe this. Can I-- Can I use your phone?

12:46.562 --> 12:49.357
Sure. I mean, they're gonna be here soon. It'll be fine.

12:50.191 --> 12:52.319
Here.

12:54.446 --> 12:57.784
-I'm gonna call them. -It'll be okay. Just--

12:57.784 --> 12:59.953
That's a nice beard, man.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.541
-What's that? -That's a nice beard.

13:03.541 --> 13:05.418
-Thank you. -Yeah.

13:06.918 --> 13:08.255
Yeah.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.631
How long have you been growing that wild cat?

13:09.631 --> 13:12.300
Uh, you know, six, seven months.

13:14.262 --> 13:15.847
Yours is nice too.

13:17.766 --> 13:19.933
Thanks, bro. Two years.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.311
Don't regret it any single day.

13:21.311 --> 13:24.022
Nice. That's good.

13:24.022 --> 13:25.940
Perfect. Perfect beard.

13:25.940 --> 13:28.194
Okay, I'll hold, 'cause I'm not late.

13:28.194 --> 13:30.946
I'm not late or anything.

13:30.946 --> 13:33.117
You put stuff in it.

13:33.117 --> 13:34.618
You know, occasionally, like, shampoo.

13:34.618 --> 13:37.873
You got to be crazy.

13:37.873 --> 13:38.956
Occasional champagne in this one.

13:38.956 --> 13:40.958
You know what I mean?

13:40.958 --> 13:41.959
Sure, yeah.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.463
I-F-E-R, Jennifer. Jennifer, as in Jennifer, Jennifer?

13:43.962 --> 13:47.966
-Yeah. -You live out here or you commute?

13:47.966 --> 13:50.969
Live right there. That's my dog Lou.

13:51.263 --> 13:55.225
-And that's your car. -You know what, forget it.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.978
It's here. Yeah, thank you for your help.

13:57.978 --> 13:59.980
This is crazy.

13:59.980 --> 14:01.859
Hi. The whole point of a car sharing program, is the sharing. You know.

14:09.992 --> 14:11.704
Sorry, sorry. I'm so sorry.

14:12.914 --> 14:14.665
Let's get you in the car, huh.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.419
Fine. There you go. Watch your head. Watch your head, come on.

14:31.685 --> 14:35.523
I'm Colleen Thorndyke,

14:35.523 --> 14:37.023
and we're here today with author J.M. Lee

14:37.023 --> 14:39.319
discussing her new book, Blind Hearts.

14:39.319 --> 14:41.656
So, tell me, J.M., how did youcome up with the charactersof this novel.

14:41.656 --> 14:44.909
[Jennifer]Well, Colleen this is one of the most personal novels I've ever written.

14:45.201 --> 14:49.456
And it's about a marriage. The story is a metaphor,

14:49.456 --> 14:53.502
and I guess I really wouldn't want to say much more than that.

14:53.502 --> 14:57.215
[woman on radio] You know,rare that a novelist surpassesa heralded debut novel

14:57.215 --> 15:00.844
with one that's even more accomplished and finely nuanced.

15:00.844 --> 15:04.055
And you wrote this so quickly.How did you do it?

15:04.055 --> 15:06.977
I just do the work.

15:06.977 --> 15:08.812
When you put in the time, you're bound to come up with something.

15:08.812 --> 15:12.650
I guess you can say I'm very disciplined about my writing.

15:14.485 --> 15:15.904
Did you bring your manuscript?

15:18.281 --> 15:19.825
-What's that? -Did you bring your manuscript?

15:19.825 --> 15:23.830
You know what, I'm not gonna read anything. It's fine.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.624
David, no. What?

15:26.624 --> 15:28.919
The whole point of all of this, was... it's supposed to be an opportunity for you.

15:30.253 --> 15:34.090
I do not need to go to this thing.

15:34.090 --> 15:35.426
I could have been home, writing.

15:35.426 --> 15:37.220
Why didn't you bring it?

15:37.220 --> 15:39.723
I couldn't find a passage I liked.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.141
I read the whole thing and it was just like...

15:41.141 --> 15:42.768
The whole thing's crap. It just needs...

15:42.768 --> 15:44.520
It needs a massive rewriting.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.188
Just need like another month with it.

15:46.188 --> 15:48.106
David, another month?

15:48.106 --> 15:49.610
You've written a whole book. A whole book full of passages.

15:50.444 --> 15:54.449
It's... I'm sure you can find one passage to read.

15:54.616 --> 15:59.038
Oh, oh, oh. You know what? You've emailed me a copy of your script.

15:59.245 --> 16:02.959
You can read it off my iPad.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.794
It's fine. I don't need to read anything. It will be fine.

16:04.794 --> 16:07.297
Okay, I'm sorry. What's going on?

16:08.130 --> 16:11.719
Is this like self-sabotage here or like...

16:11.719 --> 16:14.890
Maybe it wouldn't seem that way if my brilliant wife would actually do me a favor

16:14.890 --> 16:18.935
and read what I've written, and may be provide some constructive criticism,

16:18.935 --> 16:23.107
then I wouldn't feel so weird showing it to your publisher.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.028
Look, I'm just under a tremendous amount of pressure

16:26.028 --> 16:28.153
and I can't leave the world of my book to enter the world of your book.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.658
It'd take weeks to get back to it.

16:30.658 --> 16:32.826
How come whenever I ask for something, there's a world you can't leave

16:32.826 --> 16:35.789
or there's an interview that you have to prepare for.

16:35.789 --> 16:38.708
I mean, do you even like my work?

16:38.708 --> 16:40.167
Of course, I like your work.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.505
What do you think I'm doing right now?

16:42.505 --> 16:44.091
I'm supporting you and your work.

16:44.173 --> 16:45.591
I just wish sometimes

16:47.761 --> 16:50.014
you could try a little bit harder with people.

16:50.014 --> 16:52.767
Like when they look at you at a party,

16:52.767 --> 16:54.477
you look like you're dead inside.

16:54.477 --> 16:56.396
You know what, maybe I wouldn't seem like I was dying

16:56.396 --> 16:59.315
if, you know, maybe we had sex every once in a while.

17:04.823 --> 17:08.200
We have sex.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.617
Barely.

17:15.794 --> 17:19.213
-Pull over. -What?

17:19.213 --> 17:21.050
Pull over. Just do it.

17:21.050 --> 17:23.803
-Right here. Just pull over. -All right.

17:23.803 --> 17:25.512
All right. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.223
Don't yell at me. What are you doing?

17:28.223 --> 17:31.019
You want sex? We're doing sex.

17:31.019 --> 17:32.228
-What? Right here? No-- -Yeah.

17:32.228 --> 17:34.273
This is a rental car. Jen, we don't know who's been in here.

17:34.733 --> 17:38.235
Ow, ow, that's my hand.

17:40.948 --> 17:43.701
Oh, snap.

17:49.791 --> 17:53.252
My jacket. It's stuck.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.394
Hi, there. You roll down your window please?

18:06.394 --> 18:09.271
What's going on here? Roll down the window.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.026
You guys lost?

18:14.821 --> 18:16.865
Yes, yes. We're-- We're lost. We just--

18:16.865 --> 18:20.368
We just stopped to look at the map.

18:20.368 --> 18:22.914
Uh, guys,

18:22.914 --> 18:26.919
we know you were having sex. It was, uh, pretty obvious. -No, no. We weren't having sex. -Are we in trouble?

18:27.293 --> 18:30.923
Well, here's the thing.

18:30.923 --> 18:32.842
The glass in your car, it's completely see through.

18:32.842 --> 18:36.303
-Transparent. -Yeah.

18:36.303 --> 18:37.597
That means that anybody driving by on this highway

18:37.597 --> 18:39.516
can see inside, and they can see what's going on.

18:39.516 --> 18:41.602
-Everything. -It's called indecent exposure.

18:41.602 --> 18:44.605
-Oh, God. -And that's a crime.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.066
Normally we get that with high school kids,

18:46.066 --> 18:47.984
but you guys seem a little mature for that.

18:47.984 --> 18:50.863
I don't have a PH.D, But I'm thinking maybe on some level

18:50.863 --> 18:54.617
you guys wanna get caught in the act for something like that?

18:54.617 --> 18:56.661
-What? No. -No, no. No, no.

18:56.661 --> 18:58.914
-Is that what this is? -You want us to watch you?

18:58.914 --> 19:00.707
-No, no, no, no. -What?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.709
'Cause if that's what you want,

19:02.709 --> 19:05.255
we can watch you.

19:05.255 --> 19:06.798
-No, thanks. -No, no. We are incredibly private people.

19:06.798 --> 19:09.134
We are so--

19:09.134 --> 19:10.594
So private, I don't even like to pee in front of him, you know.

19:10.594 --> 19:13.347
Can I see some identification, please?

19:13.347 --> 19:15.225
Sure, sure, sure.

19:15.225 --> 19:16.852
Thank you.

19:17.978 --> 19:20.355
Different last names. Surprise, surprise.

19:20.355 --> 19:23.358
All right. So we're married, we're just not married to each other.

19:23.358 --> 19:26.487
Oh, no. We're married to each other.

19:26.487 --> 19:27.614
-Yeah. -I just kept my last name.

19:27.614 --> 19:29.616
-For work. I'm a writer. -Please, Ma'am.

19:29.616 --> 19:32.871
Normally, for this kind of thing, we got to give a summons. But, uh...

19:34.038 --> 19:36.499
I don't know. What do you think, partner?

19:37.877 --> 19:41.005
-Well, I don't know. -We'll let them off with a warning, or...

19:41.005 --> 19:43.591
-These guys... -So sorry.

19:43.591 --> 19:47.386
-Yeah, we can let them off with a warning. -Yeah, all right.

19:47.386 --> 19:50.389
-Thank you. -Stay out of trouble.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.726
-Transparent windows. -Thank you, Officer.

19:57.941 --> 20:01.821
-That was so horrible. -That was so terrible.

20:01.821 --> 20:04.991
-Let's never do that again. No. -So not worth it.

20:09.330 --> 20:12.415
Ugh!

20:12.415 --> 20:14.127
-Oh, David! -I'm sorry.

20:14.127 --> 20:16.171
-Are you serious? Come on. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:16.171 --> 20:19.342
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:19.342 --> 20:20.843
-It's really bad. It's really, really bad. -I had some ice cream.

20:20.843 --> 20:23.554
-It's not funny. -I had some ice cream.

20:23.554 --> 20:26.266
Oh, my God. Oh!

20:26.266 --> 20:28.518
Oh, no!

20:29.186 --> 20:30.646
It's passed. It's fine.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.439
-Ugh. Is it safe? -It's fine.

20:33.439 --> 20:36.070
-It's passed. It's passed. -Close the windows.

20:36.070 --> 20:39.446
Hey, we still need to pick up wine.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.242
There it is. Okay. I'm gonna take five seconds, okay?

20:43.870 --> 20:47.456
-All right. -Yes. This is amazing.

20:47.624 --> 20:50.002
Whoo-hoo!

20:53.089 --> 20:56.301
No!

20:56.301 --> 20:58.469
-No! No! -What's the problem?

20:58.887 --> 21:02.392
Shit. It's closed.

21:02.392 --> 21:05.312
Well, check the phone. See if there are any other places nearby.

21:05.312 --> 21:08.480
Oh, no, no. They're all closed.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.818
-That's impossible. -They're all closed.

21:10.818 --> 21:12.486
I'm just saying expand the map a little bit.

21:12.486 --> 21:14.322
I've expanded the map.

21:14.322 --> 21:16.116
-Excuse me, ma'am. Hi. -Hi.

21:17.659 --> 21:19.912
We're trying to stop here to get some wine. It appears to be closed.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.497
And we looked around

21:22.497 --> 21:24.209
and few other places in the area seems to be closed as well.

21:24.209 --> 21:26.501
That's because it's illegal to sell alcohol after five on a Sunday in Connecticut.

21:27.379 --> 21:31.217
Are you serious? So what do people do then?

21:31.217 --> 21:34.388
They buy their liquor before five.

21:34.388 --> 21:36.473
I think what she means is,

21:36.473 --> 21:38.058
is there, like, another place around here to pick up some wine?

21:38.058 --> 21:41.271
We're headed to a party. And we just don't want to show up empty handed.

21:41.271 --> 21:44.941
You could drive over the border to New York.

21:44.941 --> 21:47.445
You might be able to find something in Port Chester.

21:47.445 --> 21:50.781
If someone hadn't forgotten the wine, we wouldn't be in this situation.

21:50.781 --> 21:54.077
It's not like you have a lot going on right now, David.

21:54.077 --> 21:56.537
All I ask is that you bring the stuff that I went out of my way to get.

21:58.539 --> 22:02.378
Even though I have this deadline

22:02.378 --> 22:03.629
and you should be supporting me right now.

22:03.629 --> 22:05.548
I should be supporting you?

22:05.548 --> 22:07.549
Jennifer, I read every draft of your last book.

22:08.551 --> 22:12.639
And gave extensive notes. And there were many, many drafts.

22:12.639 --> 22:16.186
And now, when all I'm asking is for you to return the favor,

22:16.186 --> 22:19.563
and read something of mine,

22:19.563 --> 22:21.150
you're like, "Oh, I can't leave the world of my book."

22:21.150 --> 22:23.569
That's fucked up, Jennifer, and you know it.

22:23.569 --> 22:26.948
My therapist says, when you get like this,

22:26.948 --> 22:28.950
-it triggers my anxiety. -Your therapist is an idiot.

22:28.950 --> 22:32.413
He butt dials you on a daily basis.

22:32.413 --> 22:33.956
He just got an iPhone. It's a difficult transition.

22:33.956 --> 22:37.711
Maybe it's that hard if you're a cat hoarder.

22:37.711 --> 22:39.338
-He's not a cat hoarder. -You said it yourself.

22:39.338 --> 22:41.840
Every time you showed up to a session, there's a different cat.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.260
I told you, I think he shelters them.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.846
Or maybe he's just got one cat.

22:46.846 --> 22:48.681
It just magically changes colors

22:48.681 --> 22:50.392
every time you come to visit. Like a mood ring.

22:50.392 --> 22:52.602
But more than likely,

22:52.602 --> 22:54.231
he just got a bunch of cats that he's jammed into his bedroom.

22:54.231 --> 22:56.900
When you come in for a session,

22:56.900 --> 22:58.609
and they're just clawing at the door waiting to get out.

22:58.609 --> 23:01.364
So they can piss all over that couch you've paid to sit on.

23:08.372 --> 23:12.585
Hey, you know what? Let's just try this place right here.

23:12.585 --> 23:15.213
That's a convenience store. They're not gonna have wine.

23:15.213 --> 23:18.509
You never know. Things are different when you leave the city.

23:22.721 --> 23:26.642
Yeah. There's no wine here. Let's go.

23:26.642 --> 23:28.604
Come on, let's look around.

23:28.604 --> 23:30.689
We've got to go.

23:33.651 --> 23:37.655
Ah, look. They've got a great beer selection.

23:37.655 --> 23:40.658
Let's just get a six pack.

23:40.658 --> 23:42.120
Yeah. Let's grab some Brewskis for our bros Lily and Bernard.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.039
Maybe we can get, like, a pony keg too.

23:45.039 --> 23:47.042
Okay. Look. Look right here. Look, huh.

23:47.042 --> 23:50.171
-Wine. They've got wine. -That's not wine.

23:50.171 --> 23:53.049
Sure it is. It's Palazzo de Carmelo.

23:53.049 --> 23:55.385
Nope, that's wine product.

23:55.385 --> 23:57.137
No, that's like, that's grape juice with alcohol mixed in it.

23:57.137 --> 24:00.016
Nobody will know the difference. It will be fine.

24:00.016 --> 24:01.809
Hey. Is this good?

24:01.809 --> 24:05.022
I'm just gonna ask him if there's a liquor store around here.

24:05.022 --> 24:07.941
This might be our best option.

24:07.941 --> 24:10.027
Who? Bernard and Lily are art patrons.

24:10.027 --> 24:12.197
You can't bring that into their homes.

24:12.197 --> 24:13.907
I mean, I don't know what other options we have.

24:13.907 --> 24:15.700
Look, they've got a bunch of different types. There's like a...

24:15.700 --> 24:18.746
There's a...

24:18.746 --> 24:20.706
One that looks like Pinot.

24:49.281 --> 24:53.245
Do you see a lady over there in a nice dress? No?

24:53.245 --> 24:55.956
Haven't seen a lady, have you?

25:11.641 --> 25:15.312
Do you see a woman walking by here?

25:27.951 --> 25:31.872
-Hi. How are you? -Hi, did you see my husband?

25:31.872 --> 25:34.334
He was here before.

25:34.334 --> 25:35.794
No, I don't remember.

25:35.794 --> 25:37.379
-Okay. -I'm sorry.

25:46.932 --> 25:50.810
Hey, did my wife come back through here?

25:50.810 --> 25:53.106
-No, I don't remember seeing her. -Shit!

25:53.106 --> 25:55.776
Fuck!

25:56.151 --> 25:57.027
Sure it makes sense. Perfect sense.

25:59.989 --> 26:01.824
No, It doesn't make sense at all.

26:01.824 --> 26:03.951
-Hey, look who it is. -Oh, it's the road fucker.

26:03.951 --> 26:07.540
What are you doing here?

26:07.540 --> 26:12.378
My wife and I, we were here earlier to pick up some wine and then she stepped outside and I haven't found her. She disappeared.

26:12.378 --> 26:16.175
-Wait. Your wife is missing? -Yes, my wife is missing.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.011
Or maybe your "wife" went home to her husband.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.140
-I'm the husband. -He's talking about the other husband.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.850
-Other husband. -There is no other husband.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.270
I'm the husband. It's one and the same.

26:26.270 --> 26:28.272
-They were fighting before. -What?

26:28.272 --> 26:29.733
Is that true?

26:29.733 --> 26:30.857
-No, we were not fighting. -Were you fighting?

26:30.857 --> 26:32.151
No, we got into a little argument.

26:32.151 --> 26:33.860
-We pulled over to buy some wine... -They don't sell wine here.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.448
Sure they do. The Palazzo de Carmelo.

26:36.448 --> 26:38.701
The Palazzo de Carmelo? That's bum's milk.

26:38.701 --> 26:41.245
Sometimes it's little fights that send people over the edge.

26:41.245 --> 26:43.998
Like, last week we responded to a domestic,

26:43.998 --> 26:46.168
where the wife hit the husband

26:46.168 --> 26:47.877
-in the head with a pop corn bowl. -Boom.

26:47.877 --> 26:49.213
Yeah. She split his head wide open, you know.

26:49.213 --> 26:51.048
All because he changed the channel. They were watching, uh...

26:51.048 --> 26:53.884
-What was it? -Dancing With the Stars.

26:53.884 --> 26:55.178
-Dancing With the Stars. -It was the finale.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.264
Road fucker, you ever see a show called Snapped on Oxygen?

26:58.933 --> 27:01.520
-No. -You should watch it.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.689
Lot of life lessons for you.

27:04.897 --> 27:06.191
-Okay. -Look,

27:08.319 --> 27:09.529
your wife have her cell phone on her?

27:09.529 --> 27:12.741
She doesn't own a cell phone, 'cause she's a writer

27:12.741 --> 27:15.909
and she thinks it messes with her process.

27:15.909 --> 27:18.038
Okay. What's her name?

27:18.038 --> 27:19.707
Her name's Jennifer Lee.

27:19.707 --> 27:21.459
She also goes by J.M.

27:21.459 --> 27:23.378
Wait. Your wife is J.M. Lee, the author?

27:23.378 --> 27:26.215
-Yes. -Are you kidding?

27:26.215 --> 27:28.300
We're reading Blind Hearts right now.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.969
We've got a book club down at the precinct.

27:29.969 --> 27:32.054
Are you two Julie and Derrick?

27:32.054 --> 27:33.931
-What? -Julie and Derrick, from the book, Blind Hearts.

27:33.931 --> 27:36.894
Are you blind?

27:36.894 --> 27:38.061
What? No! I'm not blind.

27:38.061 --> 27:40.106
-You could be blind in one eye. -But no, I'm not blind.

27:40.106 --> 27:42.941
And... and we're not Derrick and Julie.

27:42.941 --> 27:44.778
Hey, why don't we just hop in your squad car

27:44.778 --> 27:47.947
and maybe we could drive around a little bit

27:47.947 --> 27:48.948
see if we could find--

27:48.948 --> 27:50.493
We're not gonna hop in our squad car and drive around. No, sir.

27:51.119 --> 27:54.707
I'll take a two by four.

27:54.707 --> 27:55.956
I'll tell you what. You go to that party, and then, uh...

27:55.956 --> 27:59.170
When she shows up there, and she probably will,

27:59.170 --> 28:01.381
- why don't you give us a call? - Want a winner one.

28:01.381 --> 28:03.966
-My direct line. -Come on, mate.

28:03.966 --> 28:06.136
I'm all out of business cards.

28:06.136 --> 28:08.347
-Have fun at the party. -Thanks.

28:08.347 --> 28:11.559
Take it easy.

28:27.954 --> 28:30.164
It's like Jurassic Park.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.065
You can do this. Just...

28:53.651 --> 28:55.109
Just don't be weird.

29:55.347 --> 29:58.727
Oh.

30:00.020 --> 30:03.356
Joseph Heckler and Dan Garcia.

30:03.356 --> 30:06.944
That was wonderful.

30:06.944 --> 30:08.821
Out next performance will begin in about ten minutes.

30:08.821 --> 30:12.034
So, everyone mingle.

30:12.034 --> 30:14.202
And help yourself to some snacks.

30:16.623 --> 30:19.917
So, who do we have here?

30:19.917 --> 30:22.545
I am David Warwik.

30:23.128 --> 30:25.633
Uh, we met the other night. I'm Jennifer's wife.

30:25.633 --> 30:28.302
-I'm sorry. Jennifer's my wife. -Jennifer.

30:28.302 --> 30:30.555
Jennifer Lee. Sorry. J.M. Lee.

30:30.555 --> 30:32.432
Oh, oh. David, forgive me. I hardly recognize you without Jennifer by your side.

30:34.392 --> 30:37.813
Where is she?

30:37.813 --> 30:38.982
I was actually hoping that she was already...

30:38.982 --> 30:40.901
-Well, who do we have here? -It's Jennifer's husband.

30:40.901 --> 30:44.321
Your writer... J.M's husband.

30:44.321 --> 30:46.866
Oh, yes.

30:48.283 --> 30:51.496
Oh, I brought you some wine.

30:51.496 --> 30:54.291
Oh, so I see. Jennifer told you.

30:54.291 --> 30:57.211
-Told me what? -That I'm a wine connoisseur.

30:57.211 --> 31:00.171
She's a sommelier.

31:00.171 --> 31:01.341
I've taken a few courses.

31:01.341 --> 31:03.175
-Oh. -[Lily chuckling]

31:03.175 --> 31:04.804
Where is this wine from?

31:04.804 --> 31:06.430
You'll have to forgive me. I'm blind without my glasses.

31:08.599 --> 31:10.476
America?

31:11.853 --> 31:15.691
Oh, there is some excellent New World wines nowadays. What is the varieto?

31:15.691 --> 31:16.943
Beg your pardon?

31:16.943 --> 31:18.192
The varieto? The type of grape?

31:18.192 --> 31:20.238
It's uh...

31:20.697 --> 31:22.116
-A blend? -Oh, merlot.

31:24.199 --> 31:26.453
Merlots are extremely underrated.

31:26.453 --> 31:28.414
That's true. I've tasted some exquisite mellows

31:28.414 --> 31:31.251
-What is the vineyard? Palazzo de... -Carmelo.

31:31.251 --> 31:34.504
You know, I've never heard of them.

31:34.504 --> 31:36.757
Well, we look forward to tasting it.

31:36.757 --> 31:39.218
-Yagoda. -[Lily exclaiming] Oh!

31:39.218 --> 31:42.389
Yagoda, what is this?

31:42.389 --> 31:45.517
It's a gift. I make it for you at your artist colony.

31:45.517 --> 31:48.227
-Oh, it's fabulous, don't you think? - Wonderful.

31:57.115 --> 32:00.368
This is McDannell.

32:00.368 --> 32:02.370
Yeah. This is David Warwik. My wife is missing.

32:02.370 --> 32:05.833
Road fucker.

32:05.833 --> 32:07.501
I just... I came to the party.

32:07.501 --> 32:10.172
Like, you all said, the one that we were supposed to go to and she's...

32:11.089 --> 32:14.301
She's not here.

32:14.301 --> 32:16.179
And so I was just wondering if there was any information on your side?

32:16.179 --> 32:18.890
Yeah, I don't have anything for you yet.

32:18.890 --> 32:21.266
 Nothing?

32:21.266 --> 32:22.519
-No. -Maybe I should just

32:22.519 --> 32:25.272
come down to the station and just wait there.

32:25.272 --> 32:27.901
No,the best thing for you to dowould be to stay at that party.

32:27.901 --> 32:30.945
And then if she comes there, give us a call.

32:30.945 --> 32:33.280
And if anything washes up on this end, we'll let you know.

32:34.533 --> 32:38.286
Yeah. We got a special APB out on.

32:38.286 --> 32:40.999
-Yeah, we got a task force. -Yeah.

32:40.999 --> 32:43.585
Okay.

33:28.263 --> 33:32.309
Excuse me. You said you wanted to use the phone.

33:32.309 --> 33:35.353
It's available now.

33:35.353 --> 33:37.065
Uh, thanks. Yeah, in a minute.

33:37.065 --> 33:39.025
That's strange. It doesn't have a vintage.

33:47.952 --> 33:51.455
Does this smell right to you?

33:51.455 --> 33:53.500
No.

33:56.545 --> 34:00.382
Okay, everyone. Please take your seats.

34:00.382 --> 34:04.138
Next, we will be hearing from a young, promising writer,

34:07.267 --> 34:10.020
Eric Windbed.

34:15.775 --> 34:19.404
Well, I'm Eric Windbed.

34:19.404 --> 34:20.782
I'm gonna be reading from my yet to be published novel,

34:22.199 --> 34:25.411
Crept.

34:27.123 --> 34:30.668
When baby girl ask about daddy,

34:30.668 --> 34:33.255
momma say, he cracked.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.507
Sometimes, the crack of the whip can drive a man insane.

34:38.637 --> 34:41.639
Year was 1831.

34:42.056 --> 34:44.810
And we, we was the only white family in slavery.

34:47.188 --> 34:49.065
So, you say you still don't have a publisher?

34:51.109 --> 34:53.862
Well, I've had some offers,

34:53.862 --> 34:55.949
but I'm waiting for the best one to appear.

34:56.908 --> 34:58.410
You should give me a call in the morning.

35:00.913 --> 35:03.290
I think we can do something with this.

35:04.541 --> 35:06.752
Hi, I'm Bruce.

35:07.460 --> 35:10.048
Bruce Wayne.

35:10.464 --> 35:11.758
No relation. Not Batman.

35:12.466 --> 35:14.971
You know, my wife and I've...

35:15.888 --> 35:18.474
We've lived in this hood for, uh, 25 years.

35:18.474 --> 35:21.895
There's never been anything like this party.

35:21.895 --> 35:23.897
Oh, we used to have to go to New York for, uh,

35:23.897 --> 35:26.482
you know, a culture fix. But, uh...

35:26.482 --> 35:29.612
I mean, since Lily started these parties

35:29.612 --> 35:31.323
I don't think I'm ever gonna leave Greenwich.

35:31.323 --> 35:33.242
-What do you do? -I'm a writer.

35:33.826 --> 35:36.287
Would I happen have read something you've written?

35:36.287 --> 35:38.957
I did, uh, piece for The New Yorker a few years back.

35:38.957 --> 35:42.962
The New Yorker? You must be really good.

35:43.754 --> 35:46.590
-Uh, you know I'm all right. -Mmm-mmm.

35:47.508 --> 35:49.552
You know what I do?

35:49.552 --> 35:51.054
-I-I... I don't know. -Come on, guess.

35:52.639 --> 35:55.642
-I'm not really... -Oh, come on. Come on.

35:56.561 --> 35:57.979
I don't know. I...

36:00.065 --> 36:01.942
Lawyer?

36:03.152 --> 36:04.111
No.

36:04.820 --> 36:05.779
-Accountant? -No.

36:07.282 --> 36:09.200
Politician?

36:10.411 --> 36:12.121
Cosmetic dentistry,

36:12.121 --> 36:14.040
Okay. I was never gonna guess that.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.542
But I'm also working on a novel of my own.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.669
-Oh. -It's a sci-fi novel

36:18.669 --> 36:20.881
about a guy who has teeth growing

36:21.715 --> 36:25.053
in all sort of strange places, like, in his arm pits.

36:25.053 --> 36:28.639
This is a condition caused by a glandular problem

36:28.639 --> 36:31.518
triggered by hormones used in the dairy and meat industries.

36:33.562 --> 36:36.983
It's topical.

36:36.983 --> 36:38.943
I'm gonna give this to Bernard as soon as I finish it. And I...

36:40.111 --> 36:43.824
I think he's gonna wanna publish it.

36:43.824 --> 36:45.575
Great.

36:45.575 --> 36:46.619
Can I... Can I look at those chompers?

36:46.619 --> 36:49.579
-No, really. Let me take a look. -No, no. Please don't. No.

36:49.622 --> 36:53.336
I know you are intellectual.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.004
Get dental.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.881
Not bad. You've got a unique set of bicuspids.

36:57.673 --> 37:01.011
Thank you.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.179
-And you drink too much coffee. -Okay.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.224
That's stain in there. You smoke?

37:04.224 --> 37:06.599
No.

37:06.599 --> 37:07.811
You need a whitening session.

37:08.812 --> 37:10.439
Yeah, you're gonna call me.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.732
I'm gonna give you the friends and family discount.

37:12.732 --> 37:15.529
Thanks.

37:15.529 --> 37:16.611
So, uh, what brings you to the Bacchanalia?

37:16.611 --> 37:20.283
You're gonna read something tonight?

37:20.283 --> 37:22.119
No, I came here with my wife.

37:22.911 --> 37:25.706
Is she an artist?

37:25.706 --> 37:27.625
She's a... She's a writer as well.

37:27.625 --> 37:30.462
And where did you two meet?

37:30.921 --> 37:32.840
Your essay is really good.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.967
You should submit it to the paper this year.

37:34.967 --> 37:37.220
-Really? -Yeah.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.346
-Thanks, Professor Warwik. -No worries, yeah.

37:38.346 --> 37:41.058
Hi. Are you David Warwik?

37:41.766 --> 37:45.645
I might be. Are you about to serve me with papers?

37:46.189 --> 37:49.442
What no.

37:49.442 --> 37:51.652
All right. Then I'm David Warwik.

37:51.652 --> 37:52.737
-Hi, uh, I'm Jennifer. -Hi, Jennifer.

37:52.737 --> 37:56.284
An MFA student here.

37:56.284 --> 37:57.659
-Very nice to meet you. I'm David Warwik. -Yes, hi.

37:57.659 --> 38:01.081
I've been trying to take your class. But it's always full.

38:01.081 --> 38:03.834
Yeah. No, it is. I...

38:03.834 --> 38:06.588
I don't know what happened.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.341
All of a sudden, all of these people want to come take it.And I think it's because the syllabus this year,

38:09.341 --> 38:11.759
it looks really good.

38:11.759 --> 38:13.179
-Yeah. That's what they say. -Yeah?

38:13.179 --> 38:14.889
You give good syllabi.

38:14.889 --> 38:16.682
Yeah, I draw little pictures in the margins.

38:16.682 --> 38:18.683
It's on some nice goldenrod paper.

38:18.683 --> 38:19.978
-It's wonderful. -I love goldenrod.

38:19.978 --> 38:21.687
It's a nice Arial font.

38:21.687 --> 38:22.939
What I say in the class, nobody is paying attention to.

38:22.939 --> 38:25.318
But that syllabus, that piece of paper,

38:25.318 --> 38:27.945
people, oh, they fight over that thing. It goes on ebay.

38:27.945 --> 38:30.866
-Well. -Yeah. Are you a writer?

38:30.866 --> 38:33.369
Uh, uh...

38:33.369 --> 38:35.703
Yes, sort of. I'm trying to be.

38:35.703 --> 38:38.291
There's no trying. You are a writer.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.294
Sorry. I just wanted to tell you that, uh...

38:43.047 --> 38:45.966
I really liked your New Yorker piece.

38:45.966 --> 38:48.178
-It's really good. -Thank you. Thank you very much.

38:48.178 --> 38:50.347
That, uh...

38:50.347 --> 38:51.641
That really means a lot. I'm really glad that you read it.

38:51.641 --> 38:53.392
-Yeah. -Yeah.

38:53.893 --> 38:54.810
What are you doing right now, Jennifer?

38:57.729 --> 38:59.441
I was... I was gonna go grab a cup of coffee.

38:59.441 --> 39:01.734
-If you'd like to join me? -Yeah.

39:01.734 --> 39:04.155
-All right. Let's do it. -Okay.

39:04.614 --> 39:06.115
So, um... what are you working on right now?

39:08.494 --> 39:11.745
I'm actually working on a novel. It's a...

39:11.745 --> 39:14.459
-Really? -Yeah.

39:14.459 --> 39:15.960
Semi-autobiographical thing.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.630
You know the orgies at Yarda were totally tame this year?

39:18.630 --> 39:21.425
-Oh, that's shame. Wow. -Nothing like 2012.

39:21.425 --> 39:24.721
[scoffing] How can you compare her?

39:24.721 --> 39:26.889
-I'm still on antibiotics from it. -I know.

39:26.889 --> 39:29.767
I was proud of you though.

39:29.767 --> 39:31.646
Expanding my horizons.

39:31.646 --> 39:34.190
That's something different for you.

39:34.190 --> 39:35.774
It was something different for you.

39:35.774 --> 39:36.943
It was weird having my sister there though.

39:36.943 --> 39:39.153
-I didn't mind it. Awkwardly, I didn't mind it. -No?

39:39.153 --> 39:42.157
I just you know, I fell like... Christmas is really awkward now.

39:42.408 --> 39:46.413
I go home, and like... we just stare at each other.

39:46.413 --> 39:49.790
Right. But your work's better.

39:49.790 --> 39:51.335
Thanks. Thank you.

39:54.796 --> 39:56.633
Hi, you've reached Jennifer and David.

39:56.633 --> 39:58.800
Please leave us a message and we'll be sure to get back to you.

40:02.139 --> 40:04.225
 Jen, are you there? It's like the eight time I've called the machine.

40:04.225 --> 40:08.314
I'm kind of freaking out. I... I ran into those cops.

40:08.314 --> 40:11.275
They told me that I should come to the party

40:11.275 --> 40:13.319
and I don't know what's going on.

40:13.319 --> 40:14.945
I don't know if you're mad or what...

40:14.945 --> 40:16.906
Just give me a call and let me know you're okay. May be you're on your way.

40:16.906 --> 40:19.744
Please. Be on your way. Just... I'm so worried right now. I love you.

40:29.254 --> 40:30.838
-McDannell. -Yeah. This is David Warwik.

40:30.838 --> 40:32.966
Hey, David. I'm sorry. We still don't have any leads.

40:32.966 --> 40:36.220
Really? Nothing?

40:36.220 --> 40:40.434
Just try to relax, all right. She's gonna turn up soon. I... That's what they said in like Gone Girl.

40:40.434 --> 40:42.519
And this is starting to feel like Gone Girlsituation and she hated that book.

40:42.519 --> 40:45.939
But that might be the perfect cover

40:45.939 --> 40:48.109
for somebody who's trying to Gone Girl somebody.

40:48.109 --> 40:50.696
Hello? Hello? Hello?

40:50.696 --> 40:52.740
This guy is wound up.

40:53.866 --> 40:55.494
Yeah. No wonder she left him.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.869
Yeah. I don't blame her.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.426

41:09.426 --> 41:11.303

41:18.562 --> 41:21.897
You know, I'm thinking of moving to Detroit.

41:23.735 --> 41:25.277
My friend Jeremiah moved to Detroit and got shot in the face.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.785
-Oh, my God. -Yeah.

41:32.077 --> 41:33.911
-Jeremiah Boobar? -Yes.

41:33.911 --> 41:35.415
 He was?

41:36.374 --> 41:40.337
Two weeks ago, he moved to Detroit and got shot in the face. -Did you go to the funeral? -No.

41:40.337 --> 41:42.297
Funeral? He's alive and kicking. He's gonna make a documentary about it, you know.

41:43.298 --> 41:46.010
-Where did he get the funding? -Indiegogo.

41:49.930 --> 41:52.017
I wanna get shot in the face.

41:52.017 --> 41:53.936
I'm a critic. Book critic.

41:55.312 --> 41:57.482
-Right. -And so you... What's your genre?

41:58.150 --> 42:00.277
I don't... I don't have one.

42:01.863 --> 42:03.823
Let me give you a tip.

42:03.823 --> 42:05.116
Pick a genre and just give yourself over to it, okay?

42:05.116 --> 42:07.619
You wanna be the go-to guy for whatever your genre is.

42:07.619 --> 42:10.832
Look at Stephen King.

42:10.832 --> 42:11.999
You can carve out a little niche for yourself.

42:11.999 --> 42:14.252
Depending on the sub-genre that you pick, like,

42:14.252 --> 42:16.588
you know, pre-teen whore or adult sci-fi romance.

42:16.588 --> 42:19.257
I would, you know, narrow it down... What's your name?

42:19.257 --> 42:21.968
David Warwik.

42:21.968 --> 42:23.805
David Warwik.

42:23.805 --> 42:25.181
Okay, you want people to remember your name, David Warwik.

42:25.181 --> 42:27.851
Right there, that's tough.

42:27.851 --> 42:29.227
It doesn't have a ring to it. You know what I mean?

42:29.227 --> 42:30.978
You want something that pops. You want something tintinnabulation.

42:30.978 --> 42:33.816
Ringing of bells. Ding!

42:33.816 --> 42:35.568
You want your name, people hear name... Ding!

42:35.568 --> 42:37.654
You wanna remember it. Warwik is tardy.

42:37.654 --> 42:39.615
It falls like flat turd, splat on the pavement.

42:39.615 --> 42:41.868
You want something that has... That resonates sustainability.

42:41.868 --> 42:44.871
Like metal.

42:44.871 --> 42:46.080
Change your last name to something metallic.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.208
David Gold, David Iron. David Nickel.

42:48.208 --> 42:51.002
You almost get to flick it. You get to flick that name. It sounds so just...

42:51.002 --> 42:54.005
You know, you want people to do it.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.049
It doesn't matter what the metal is.

42:55.049 --> 42:56.968
David Bronze. David Silver.

43:08.899 --> 43:12.319
What time is it?

43:12.319 --> 43:13.905
It's around 7:00.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.158
-Are you still reading? -Shh!

43:20.412 --> 43:21.580
 Have you slept?

43:24.040 --> 43:26.253
No. I'm almost done.

43:27.587 --> 43:29.089
You stayed up all night reading it?

43:31.300 --> 43:33.344
Does that mean you like it?

43:33.344 --> 43:34.512
Will you shush? Just let me finish.

43:47.736 --> 43:51.365
Okay. You're gonna have to leave.

43:51.365 --> 43:53.034
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah.

43:54.035 --> 43:56.078
I'm gonna go breakfast.

43:59.584 --> 44:03.129
Let me just... Let me sleep.

44:27.365 --> 44:30.620
So...

44:30.620 --> 44:31.829
Do you like it?

44:43.009 --> 44:46.179
It was terrible.

44:46.722 --> 44:48.139
Oh.

44:49.933 --> 44:51.226
Yeah. I mean, I know that I have to rework the ending.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.235
Jen, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

44:59.235 --> 45:01.989
-It's brilliant. -What?

45:01.989 --> 45:03.825
Yeah. I'm so proud of you.

45:03.825 --> 45:05.368
-You think it's good? -I think it's great.

45:05.368 --> 45:07.788
How good?

45:08.580 --> 45:09.706
-I just told you, like, great. -Like "good" good?

45:09.706 --> 45:11.165
-No, no, like great? -I just told you.

45:11.165 --> 45:12.710
-It's so good. -Is it your favorite book in the whole world?

45:12.710 --> 45:15.005
 No. My favorite book is still Garfield Loves Lasagna.

45:25.225 --> 45:28.771
What are you doing?

45:30.940 --> 45:34.235
Are you drawing me?

45:45.540 --> 45:49.129
I see you've met Anal.

45:49.129 --> 45:51.672
It's spelled like anal, but it means fire in Hindi.

45:52.464 --> 45:56.302
He's a brilliant visual artist and a monk.

45:56.302 --> 45:58.931
We go to the same Ashram.

45:59.807 --> 46:01.434
I see.

46:02.102 --> 46:03.477
-I'm Daniel. -Oh, I'm David.

46:03.477 --> 46:06.732
So, what do you do?

46:06.732 --> 46:08.025
I'm a writer.

46:08.734 --> 46:10.069
Really? So am I. What genre?

46:10.069 --> 46:11.988
Well, I'm working on my first novel right now.

46:11.988 --> 46:14.532
Well, what's that about?

46:14.532 --> 46:16.241
It's a coming-of-age tale about a murder in a township in New Jersey.

46:16.618 --> 46:20.372
And it's sort of semi-autobiographical.

46:20.372 --> 46:23.460
-Is that Salman Rushdie? -What?

46:24.335 --> 46:25.963
Forget it. It's some bald guy.

46:28.090 --> 46:30.092
So, yeah. A murder...

46:30.968 --> 46:32.303
Yeah, so... Just kind off...

46:32.303 --> 46:35.263
Looking at it will be like--

46:35.263 --> 46:37.059
There were a lot of child murder books last year.

46:37.059 --> 46:39.436
Just FYI.

46:40.146 --> 46:41.481
Oh, okay.

46:42.899 --> 46:44.274
Uh, what about you? What are you working on?

46:44.274 --> 46:46.111
I never talk about my writing.

46:46.111 --> 46:48.322
Feel like it hinders the creative process.

46:52.577 --> 46:56.248
So you're reading tonight?

46:56.248 --> 46:58.626
No. No, I didn't... I didn't bring anything.

46:58.626 --> 47:01.046
That's too bad.

47:01.046 --> 47:02.421
So what are you doing here if you're not reading?

47:03.547 --> 47:06.551
My wife thought it'd be a good idea for us to come to this.

47:06.551 --> 47:09.346
Oh, who's your wife?

47:09.346 --> 47:10.890
She's a writer as well. Her name is J.M. Lee.

47:11.516 --> 47:13.476
-How is Jennifer? -You know her?

47:15.310 --> 47:17.313
Yeah.

47:17.313 --> 47:19.358
We met at a artist con I think, last fall.

47:19.358 --> 47:21.903
-The one at the Italian monastery. -That's the one.

47:21.903 --> 47:24.739
She loved that. She talked so much about it. Yeah.

47:25.865 --> 47:28.326
So, you're that David.

47:29.912 --> 47:31.330
I'm her husband, yeah.

47:33.331 --> 47:35.334
Yeah. Yeah.

47:35.334 --> 47:37.336
She's a real fire cracker.

47:37.336 --> 47:39.006
What does that mean?

47:40.842 --> 47:42.219
Nothing.

47:43.011 --> 47:44.137
Oh, excuse me.

47:46.098 --> 47:47.348
What? No, hold on. Hold on a second. What...

47:47.348 --> 47:49.601
What do you mean by that?

47:49.601 --> 47:50.979
Nothing.

47:51.312 --> 47:52.354
You don't just tell a married man

47:52.354 --> 47:53.731
his wife is a fire cracker and walk away.

47:54.524 --> 47:56.068
Sorry.

47:57.778 --> 47:59.113
Sorry?

47:59.362 --> 48:00.656
Did you fuck my wife in an Italian monastery?

48:00.656 --> 48:03.326
Oh, dude. You need to calm down.

48:03.326 --> 48:05.871
 No, I don't need to calm down.

48:05.871 --> 48:07.371
You need to tell me what happened?

48:07.371 --> 48:08.665
Nothing. We had a couple of fun dinners, drinks and grappa.

48:08.916 --> 48:12.377
You drank some grappa?

48:12.377 --> 48:14.172
Yeah. Hey, why don't you grab yourself a drink

48:14.172 --> 48:17.426
and cool off a bit.

48:17.426 --> 48:18.844
Man, you shut up and don't tell me what to do.

48:18.844 --> 48:21.890
I'm not... I don't need to cool off.

48:21.890 --> 48:23.683
I'm fucking cool, man.

48:23.683 --> 48:26.393
No. I don't think you are.

48:26.603 --> 48:28.856
I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't...

48:30.358 --> 48:32.235
I'm gonna go.

48:32.986 --> 48:34.696
Hey, you forgot your, uh...

48:35.530 --> 48:37.406
Yeah. Yeah.

49:10.821 --> 49:14.368
David.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.953
Hey, look. Check it out. It came.

49:16.703 --> 49:20.166
It looks amazing.

49:20.166 --> 49:21.542
-I can't believe it. -Oh, my god.

49:21.542 --> 49:22.794
-Congratulations. Look at that. -Thank you.

49:22.794 --> 49:25.172
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

49:25.172 --> 49:27.758
You just wait. I'll take your book next.

49:27.758 --> 49:30.095
You're a published author. That is so sexy.

49:31.469 --> 49:32.513
Oh, no.

49:34.724 --> 49:36.475
There's a typo.

49:36.475 --> 49:38.187
That's, that's okay. There are typos all the time.

49:38.187 --> 49:40.731
I know. It's the dedication page.

49:42.192 --> 49:42.692
David Warwi.

49:45.486 --> 49:47.698
They forgot the K in your last name.

49:47.698 --> 49:50.491
Is this... Is this the proof?

49:50.491 --> 49:51.911
It's the first edition. So maybe for the next draft.

49:53.997 --> 49:57.001
Sure. Yeah.

49:58.585 --> 49:59.379
I'm sorry, honey.

50:02.048 --> 50:03.383
 It's not a big deal.

50:04.843 --> 50:06.470
David. Hey.

50:07.263 --> 50:09.514
-Charles. -Nice to see you.

50:09.514 --> 50:11.516
-It's great to see you. -Yeah.

50:11.516 --> 50:12.978
I didn't expect to see you here.

50:12.978 --> 50:14.688
Yeah. Yeah, I used to be with Bernard

50:14.688 --> 50:16.441
before I went over to Loranda Press.

50:16.441 --> 50:17.774
Oh. Oh, wow. Wow. It... it's...

50:17.774 --> 50:21.154
-It's really nice to see you. -Likewise.

50:21.154 --> 50:23.031
-Yeah. God, I haven't seen you in ages. -Yeah.

50:23.031 --> 50:25.784
Like, three, four years, something like that?

50:25.784 --> 50:27.953
-The wedding. -The wedding.

50:27.953 --> 50:29.663
-Yes. -Fuck, the wedding. The wedding was amazing.

50:29.663 --> 50:32.500
-Yes. -That was an amazing wedding.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.835
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

50:33.835 --> 50:35.544
Jennifer did most of the planning and...

50:35.544 --> 50:37.546
I fucked Flora Bianca that night.

50:37.546 --> 50:39.549
-Really? -Yeah. It was amazing.

50:39.549 --> 50:41.551
-Wonderful. -Yeah. She opened a lot of...

50:41.551 --> 50:43.889
Lot of doors for me that night.

50:43.889 --> 50:46.434
It was great. Yeah. Lost touch with her unfortunately.

50:46.434 --> 50:49.560
Oh, well. If you want I...

50:49.560 --> 50:51.189
No, I think she sent me a pretty clear message, but...

50:51.189 --> 50:55.194
Anyway, still have good memories about that night.

50:55.194 --> 50:56.987
-It's really fine. -Nice. Uh, wonderful. Wonderful, yeah.

50:56.987 --> 50:59.572
Listen, I've been really backed up at work,

50:59.572 --> 51:01.951
and things have just gone a little nutty.

51:01.951 --> 51:03.912
And I lost out a few things. I'm really sorry.

51:03.912 --> 51:05.579
I never got back to the last email you sent me. I feel bad about that.

51:05.579 --> 51:09.001
Of course. Of course. You're busy.

51:09.001 --> 51:11.505
How's the job going, by the way?

51:11.505 --> 51:13.006
It's good. I mean, it is busy. But it's also, you know,

51:13.006 --> 51:15.884
really fun and rewarding, and nutty and...

51:15.884 --> 51:18.262
For me, it's still very, very fulfilling. You know.

51:18.262 --> 51:20.348
-It's great. I love it. -It's great. It's great.

51:20.348 --> 51:23.060
I read the, uh,

51:23.060 --> 51:24.520
Those first few chapters you sent my way.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.980
-And it's really good. -Thank you. Thank you.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.026
Thank you. That means so much. Thank you so much.

51:30.026 --> 51:31.945
Yeah. Of course. Thanks for sharing it.

51:31.945 --> 51:33.405
Yeah, it's really good. I really enjoyed it.

51:33.405 --> 51:35.614
Ultimately, I decided, um,

51:35.614 --> 51:37.617
not to forward it to the acquisitions team.

51:37.617 --> 51:39.745
Um, but I really did like it.

51:39.745 --> 51:41.581
You liked it but you didn't forward it?

51:42.706 --> 51:46.086
Yeah, I mean, there is some beautiful moments in it.

51:46.086 --> 51:48.629
You know, it's beautiful sentences,

51:48.629 --> 51:49.882
some really strong characters and story lines.

51:49.882 --> 51:51.134
But ultimately, it just felt a little, um...

51:51.134 --> 51:54.221
Just overall, it's a little challenging.

51:54.221 --> 51:56.807
I guess I thought challenging was supposed to be a good thing.

51:56.807 --> 51:59.936
Yeah. Sometimes. I mean, it can be certainly.

51:59.936 --> 52:02.272
But you know, this was challenging... difficult

52:02.272 --> 52:04.774
rather than challenging rewarding.

52:04.774 --> 52:06.650
Yeah. It just sounds like you don't like it.

52:06.650 --> 52:08.821
It's okay. You can say it.

52:08.821 --> 52:10.532
No, no, no, no. It's not that. Certainly, I genuinely did like it.

52:10.532 --> 52:12.658
I just felt, for a first novel, it was overly ambitious.

52:13.410 --> 52:17.165
You know, I think you're underwriting

52:17.165 --> 52:18.664
and overwriting at the same time.

52:18.664 --> 52:19.876
And also, the whole coming-of-age thing is just...

52:19.876 --> 52:22.753
It's been explored so many times,

52:22.753 --> 52:24.298
from so many different angles, it just feels a little familiar.

52:24.298 --> 52:27.468
And the subject matter, you know, racism...

52:27.468 --> 52:30.678
It's heavy. You know, it's heavy stuff.

52:30.678 --> 52:32.140
It's not exactly beach material.

52:32.140 --> 52:33.892
How long have you been working on it for?

52:33.892 --> 52:36.685
You know, not that long. A few...

52:36.685 --> 52:38.856
A few years. But not really, you know, not...

52:38.856 --> 52:42.194
You ever thought about maybe just taking a step back and...

52:42.194 --> 52:45.573
trying something else.

52:45.573 --> 52:46.697
You're working on other stuff right now?

52:46.697 --> 52:48.075
You know, there's other stuff I should pick up

52:49.410 --> 52:51.704
and put some things down,

52:51.704 --> 52:52.830
it all comes in fits and starts, so...

52:52.830 --> 52:55.250
-Right. -Yeah.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.669
Well, I know there's another good book inside you.

52:56.669 --> 52:59.297
Like Jennifer, you know, or...

53:00.006 --> 53:02.967
J.M. I guess that's her literary...

53:02.967 --> 53:05.387
Just a literary name. She's still Jennifer.

53:05.387 --> 53:07.056
She's still the same Jennifer.

53:07.056 --> 53:08.265
Same Jennifer. Look at how prolific she is.

53:08.265 --> 53:10.310
Just pumping out one book after the next.

53:10.310 --> 53:12.187
And look what it's doing to her career.

53:12.187 --> 53:13.729
She's blowing the fuck up.

53:13.729 --> 53:15.358
-Yeah. She is. She is. -Right.New York Times bestseller list.

53:15.358 --> 53:18.152
Are you kidding? That's huge. Right?

53:18.152 --> 53:20.737
Yeah, we're all proud of her.

53:20.737 --> 53:22.199
-Yeah. -Yeah.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.742
It's crazy. I always thought you'd be the one who, blew up first. But, uh...

53:24.993 --> 53:28.747
I guess she beat you to the punch.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.875
Yeah. She beat me to the punch.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.295
-Yeah. -Yeah.

53:33.295 --> 53:34.753
Is she here? I'd love to... to say hi to her.

53:35.047 --> 53:37.717
No, she is not.

53:38.510 --> 53:40.760
Well, if you see her at home, say hi.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.389
I will do that, Charles. I will do that.

53:42.389 --> 53:44.392
She's in a great groove.

53:44.392 --> 53:45.476
All right. It was really, really nice seeing you.

53:45.476 --> 53:47.311
And, uh, I'm gonna hit this baby quiche before it runs out.

53:47.311 --> 53:49.771
-Yeah. Yeah. -Nice seeing you. Good luck with everything.

53:49.771 --> 53:51.441
And send me an email when there's more stuff to share.

53:51.441 --> 53:53.944
-Yep. Yep. -Okay.

54:46.837 --> 54:50.385
Can I get a Scotch neat?

54:53.347 --> 54:56.849
Martini with a twist.

54:56.849 --> 54:59.020
Sawyer Edwards. Right?

54:59.020 --> 55:00.854
-Have we met? -I'm David Warwik.

55:00.854 --> 55:03.650
We met yesterday. I'm J.M. Lee's husband.

55:04.360 --> 55:07.279
David Warwik.

55:07.781 --> 55:10.492
That sounds so familiar. Are you a cartoonist?

55:10.492 --> 55:13.537
No, I'm... I'm...

55:13.537 --> 55:14.747
I'm a writer.

55:15.706 --> 55:16.791
Would I have read any of your work?

55:16.791 --> 55:18.668
Wrote a piece for the New Yorker a few years back.

55:20.504 --> 55:22.880
What was it about?

55:22.880 --> 55:24.174
It was about a guy with HPV.

55:24.174 --> 55:26.884
Not-not me. It was a work of fiction.

55:28.471 --> 55:30.557
What, uh, what brings you to the salon?

55:32.351 --> 55:35.896
I like going where I'm unexpected. But...

55:35.896 --> 55:39.692
To be honest, I'm regretting my decision. It's so boring.

55:39.984 --> 55:43.904
That Windbad guy, more like Wind bag.

55:43.904 --> 55:46.534
Yes!

55:46.534 --> 55:47.576
I don't know how he dare call himself a writer.

55:47.576 --> 55:49.078
-He was garbage. -Oh, so unbearable.

55:49.078 --> 55:51.206
Can't believe we all clapped for him.

55:51.206 --> 55:53.583
Is Jordan with you tonight?

55:55.961 --> 55:58.047
No.

55:59.173 --> 56:00.133
He left me this morning.

56:00.133 --> 56:03.178
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't... I shouldn't have pried.

56:03.178 --> 56:06.306
He said he can't handle my moods.

56:06.306 --> 56:08.393
I suppose it's for the best.

56:08.393 --> 56:10.103
Gives me a new mantra to live by.

56:10.103 --> 56:12.021
Oh, what's that?

56:12.021 --> 56:13.691
Fuck everybody.

56:14.023 --> 56:15.192
Nice.

56:17.278 --> 56:18.195
Some men can't handle a strong woman.

56:18.195 --> 56:20.947
You're married to Jennifer, so, I guess it's not a problem for you.

56:23.410 --> 56:25.162
Uh, no.

56:26.706 --> 56:27.790
You like strong women?

56:27.790 --> 56:29.208
-Sure, yeah. I guess so. -Good.

56:34.631 --> 56:36.175
Excuse me for a moment. It's business.

56:37.510 --> 56:39.970
Sure.

56:39.970 --> 56:41.473
Hey.

56:42.933 --> 56:43.934
You want a top up?

56:44.727 --> 56:46.020
Sure. Yeah.

56:46.020 --> 56:47.731
No, I told you.

56:47.731 --> 56:50.692
No one wants to read a novel about strange trans-animals.

56:50.692 --> 56:51.067
Thanks.

56:53.986 --> 56:55.280
 I'm in the middle of something. Call me tomorrow.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.034
Oh! Sorry about that. It's James Franco.

56:58.034 --> 57:01.204
That cunt drives me insane.

57:01.204 --> 57:03.332
 Yeah.

57:03.875 --> 57:05.250
So, are you reading anything tonight?

57:05.250 --> 57:07.587
No, I decided not to read anything.

57:08.338 --> 57:11.006
Oh, that's too bad.

57:11.006 --> 57:12.927
If you're not reading anything, why are you here?

57:13.134 --> 57:15.638
[sighing] Jennifer.

57:16.680 --> 57:17.933
And where is Jennifer?

57:19.015 --> 57:20.644
I don't-- I have no idea.

57:24.314 --> 57:28.069
You know what, I should... I should put this down.

57:28.069 --> 57:30.822
Why?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.533
I'm starting to just feel a little dizzy.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.828
Vertigo?

57:36.035 --> 57:37.330
Something like that.

57:37.914 --> 57:40.040
I think I have something that might help.

57:43.254 --> 57:46.716
Meet me out back.

58:21.381 --> 58:24.635
David.

58:24.635 --> 58:26.387
Oh, no. I didn't really want to smoke weed.

58:26.387 --> 58:29.097
I-I just needed to get out of that place.

58:33.228 --> 58:36.733
Let's play a game.

58:36.733 --> 58:38.359
Oh, okay. What kind of game?

58:39.319 --> 58:41.989
The getting to know you game.

58:41.989 --> 58:44.115
I'm gonna ask you a question.

58:44.115 --> 58:46.036
And you have to answer it.

58:46.036 --> 58:47.704
No matter what.

58:48.119 --> 58:49.706
Okay, shoot.

58:51.123 --> 58:52.584
What's the kinkiest thing you've ever done?

58:56.339 --> 58:57.465
-Like sexually? -Yes.

59:01.637 --> 59:02.262
Uh-huh.

59:06.266 --> 59:10.145
I once had sex in a botanical garden.

59:11.356 --> 59:13.317
I have really bad allergies

59:15.070 --> 59:16.152
and the pollen count was really high.

59:16.152 --> 59:18.154
So I just sneezed through the whole thing.

59:18.154 --> 59:21.242
I, it was actually pretty awful.

59:22.787 --> 59:24.038
Yeah. What about you?

59:28.043 --> 59:31.171
Have you ever heard of erotic asphyxiation?

59:33.465 --> 59:35.300
That's like when people strangle themselves to, like, masturbate?

59:39.807 --> 59:43.185
I didn't say auto-erotic.

59:43.185 --> 59:45.437
I would never do it alone. That's just obscene.

59:46.438 --> 59:48.525
All right, uh...

59:49.859 --> 59:51.444
You win for kinkiest thing.

59:51.444 --> 59:53.948
You should try it.

59:56.076 --> 59:58.201
I... I don't think so. It sounds pretty terrifying to me.

59:58.411 --> 01:00:02.206
It's not, if you really trust the person.

01:00:03.084 --> 01:00:05.210
Okay.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:11.552
So,

01:00:11.552 --> 01:00:12.845
tell me about this book you're trying to get published.

01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:16.850
How'd... How'd you know I was trying to get a book published?

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.186
You have that look.

01:00:20.062 --> 01:00:21.229
What look?

01:00:23.107 --> 01:00:24.232
The... sad puppy look.

01:00:24.232 --> 01:00:27.738
The look of desperation and hunger.

01:00:27.738 --> 01:00:30.365
I know it well.

01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:31.908
Sorry.

01:00:33.077 --> 01:00:34.203
Don't apologize.

01:00:34.203 --> 01:00:35.913
Hunger is good.

01:00:36.706 --> 01:00:38.666
You what your problem is, David?

01:00:40.418 --> 01:00:42.254
That I don't have a last name that's a metal?

01:00:42.254 --> 01:00:45.675
You're completely overshadowed by your wife.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.511
She has more heat.

01:00:49.262 --> 01:00:50.973
As long as you're with her,

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:52.933
you'll always be known as J.M. Lee's husband.

01:00:52.933 --> 01:00:56.269
Doesn't matter how many novels you write.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:59.272
I don't... I don't think that's true.

01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:01.275
Believe me.

01:01:01.275 --> 01:01:02.736
There's not enough room in one relationship for two artists.

01:01:03.361 --> 01:01:06.908
One always suffers.

01:01:06.908 --> 01:01:08.618
I don't... I don't see it that way.

01:01:12.831 --> 01:01:16.292
I have an idea.

01:01:16.292 --> 01:01:17.796
-Let's go skinny dipping. -What?

01:01:18.713 --> 01:01:20.132
-Oh, no. -Come on.

01:01:22.218 --> 01:01:24.262
No. What are you doing?

01:01:24.262 --> 01:01:25.889
-Put your clothes on. -Let's go skinny dipping.

01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.515
-No! People can see. -No, they can't.

01:01:27.515 --> 01:01:29.810
-It will be fine. - Those windows are open.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.230
-I don't want to do it alone. - Stop that.

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:34.649
All right. Now you're having fun, right?

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.279
- No, no. -David, don't be a baby.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.200
 Leave me alone.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:47.705
Whoo. Yeah.

01:01:52.169 --> 01:01:54.046
Yeah.

01:01:55.006 --> 01:01:56.216
Why did you do that?

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.340
-Isn't this great? -No!

01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.761
I'm soaked.

01:01:59.761 --> 01:02:00.637
So, you'll dry off. Relax. Enjoy it.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:03.431
My phone.

01:02:03.975 --> 01:02:07.352
Well, how was I supposed to know you had a phone in your pocket. I thought you were just happy to see me.

01:02:09.022 --> 01:02:10.148
It's not turning on.

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:11.357
Oh, calm down. I'll get you a new one.

01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:13.194
No. I'm expecting a call.

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:16.362
Drop it in a bag of rice. It will dry out.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.700
Come on! Come back!

01:02:20.535 --> 01:02:22.370
David.

01:02:23.622 --> 01:02:24.790
Come back!

01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:26.751
I miss you.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.518
[man on voice message] You have reached

01:02:41.518 --> 01:02:43.021
the voicemail box of David Warwik.

01:02:49.862 --> 01:02:53.782
Hi. Can I have a number for a taxi company?

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.878
I'm sorry.

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:06.381
So I see you had the Sawyer experience.

01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:09.051
Don't worry. She does this every year.

01:03:20.521 --> 01:03:23.817
Uh, fuck.

01:03:23.817 --> 01:03:25.278
Can I have the phone number for the police department?

01:03:32.954 --> 01:03:37.084
Police Department. Chucky speaking. How may I direct your call?

01:03:37.084 --> 01:03:40.128
Yeah. I need to speak to Officer McDannel.

01:03:40.128 --> 01:03:43.257
Who's calling?

01:03:43.257 --> 01:03:44.634
My name is David Warwik.

01:03:44.634 --> 01:03:46.345
Hey, aren't you the guy who lost his wife at the Quik Mart?

01:03:46.345 --> 01:03:48.763
Yes. Yes. That's me.

01:03:48.763 --> 01:03:50.472
Oh, I know all about you.

01:03:50.472 --> 01:03:53.102
I've been reading your wife's book.

01:03:53.102 --> 01:03:54.812
Great. Have you found Jennifer?

01:03:54.812 --> 01:03:57.107
No, they still haven't found her.

01:03:57.107 --> 01:03:58.775
But to be honest, I don't think they are looking that hard.

01:03:58.775 --> 01:04:01.653
-What? -It's a code yellow.

01:04:01.653 --> 01:04:04.489
What is a code yellow?

01:04:04.489 --> 01:04:05.950
It's really not a priority.

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:08.493
It's the code that we give people who lose their ATM cards.

01:04:08.493 --> 01:04:12.125
But I'll let them know that you're still looking for her.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:15.003
Yes, I'm still looking for her.

01:04:15.003 --> 01:04:17.297
Hey, can I ask you a question?

01:04:17.297 --> 01:04:18.882
-Is it about Jennifer? -Sort of.

01:04:18.882 --> 01:04:21.509
In the book,

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:22.886
are Julie and Derrick ghosts?

01:04:22.886 --> 01:04:25.265
What the fuck?

01:04:35.901 --> 01:04:39.529
I have no idea what he's saying.

01:04:39.529 --> 01:04:42.243
But it's beautiful.

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:48.959
One second.

01:04:48.959 --> 01:04:50.377
May I come in? I'd like to apologize.

01:04:53.714 --> 01:04:55.632
Sure.

01:04:56.968 --> 01:04:58.304
I'm sorry I pushed you in the pool.

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:02.808
It's just one of those things I can't resist.

01:05:02.808 --> 01:05:05.353
It's like popcorn or marshmallows or cocaine.

01:05:05.353 --> 01:05:08.564
Do you happen to have any?

01:05:08.564 --> 01:05:09.649
No.

01:05:12.445 --> 01:05:15.823
What's with that beard?

01:05:15.823 --> 01:05:18.118
What about it?

01:05:18.575 --> 01:05:19.828
I think beards are about men not wanting to be seen.

01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:23.791
You're looking for something to hide behind.

01:05:24.209 --> 01:05:26.127
No, I'm not.

01:05:27.586 --> 01:05:29.131
Yes, you are. You're hiding behind that beard.

01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:33.928
No, it's just a beard. It's not that important.

01:05:33.928 --> 01:05:36.680
-You're hiding. -You're being ridiculous.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.934
If it's so ridiculous, then shave it off.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.686
-No. -Why not?

01:05:41.686 --> 01:05:43.439
Reveal yourself.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.899
There's nothing to reveal. It's just a beard.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.319
You just said it's not important. Why don't you prove it?

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:50.532
Shave that shit off.

01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:54.035
No! I, uh... I don't even have a razor.

01:06:00.918 --> 01:06:04.297
Here we are.

01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:05.298
You're serious. No. I'm not doing this.

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:12.431
I'll make you a deal.

01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:13.766
You shave off your beard,

01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:16.644
and I promise, I'll help you publish your book.

01:06:18.147 --> 01:06:20.232
Send it to me when it's ready

01:06:21.733 --> 01:06:23.111
and I'll send it out to all best houses.

01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:25.697
But you don't even know what it's about.

01:06:26.656 --> 01:06:28.992
So,

01:06:28.992 --> 01:06:30.244
tell me about it.

01:06:30.659 --> 01:06:32.204
What's it about?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.457
Okay. It's...

01:06:36.501 --> 01:06:39.171
a coming-of-age, uh, tale about a...

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.551
It takes place in 1980s.

01:06:43.926 --> 01:06:45.677
-That sounds brilliant. -It does?

01:06:45.677 --> 01:06:47.346
Yes. Send me a copy when it's ready.

01:06:47.346 --> 01:06:50.683
-Really? -Definitely.

01:06:50.683 --> 01:06:53.104
I'll sell the shit out of it.

01:06:53.104 --> 01:06:55.148
But you haven't even read it.

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:57.150
So?

01:06:57.691 --> 01:06:58.986
You might not like it.

01:06:59.694 --> 01:07:01.197
That doesn't matter.

01:07:02.657 --> 01:07:04.576
David, I've sold horrible work.

01:07:04.742 --> 01:07:08.456
Like, truly terrible stuff.

01:07:08.456 --> 01:07:10.957
Like, we should have put a warning on the book jacket,

01:07:10.957 --> 01:07:14.086
It was so bad.

01:07:14.086 --> 01:07:15.171
I'm sure if there's a photo of handsome,

01:07:15.171 --> 01:07:18.717
charming you on the book jacket,

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:21.471
without a beard,

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:23.598
we will be able to sell your work.

01:07:27.894 --> 01:07:31.440
So what do you say?

01:07:32.525 --> 01:07:34.319
I don't understand why you can get an egg white omelet

01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:36.737
when you can't get an egg yolk omelet.

01:07:36.737 --> 01:07:38.240
Oh, excuse me. Hi.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.451
Hey.

01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:41.577
Hey.

01:07:41.577 --> 01:07:43.037
-Remember? I... -You're J.M. Lee.

01:07:43.037 --> 01:07:44.913
-Yeah. From before. -Yeah.

01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:47.084
We were reading your book.

01:07:47.084 --> 01:07:48.752
-What? Oh, okay. -Yeah.

01:07:48.752 --> 01:07:50.753
Your husband's looking for you.

01:07:50.753 --> 01:07:51.880
Yes! I've been waiting for like an hour.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.384
I can't get a cab. Can you give me a ride?

01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:39.645
Can I try?

01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:40.688
Have you ever shaved a guy before?

01:08:42.356 --> 01:08:44.942
Of course.

01:08:46.987 --> 01:08:48.529
Trust me.

01:09:18.691 --> 01:09:22.153
Hey, what are you doing? No.

01:09:22.153 --> 01:09:23.862
-Trust me. -Stop it! No!

01:09:23.862 --> 01:09:24.947
You should trust me. It's how you play.

01:09:24.947 --> 01:09:26.825
You're fucking crazy.

01:09:26.825 --> 01:09:27.993
David.

01:09:28.868 --> 01:09:30.203
You didn't finish shaving.

01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:31.955
Hey, do you want us to turn on the siren?

01:09:32.872 --> 01:09:34.835
-We can turn on the lights, we can turn on the siren. -No, that's okay.

01:09:34.835 --> 01:09:36.711
I've seen them before.

01:09:36.711 --> 01:09:38.962
No, I'll do it. I'll do it real quick.-It's great. -Watch this, watch this.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:40.881
Hey.

01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:43.135
Right? Everyone's clearing the way.

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:44.886
-Watch out. -Here we go.

01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.515
Author coming through. Author coming through. Watch them clear out.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.975
Watch them clear out.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.227
I'm wondering if I could sculpt with meat.

01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:52.814
Absolutely.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:53.981
I feel like it would bind really well.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.527
The moma would take it.

01:09:56.527 --> 01:09:58.195
And when it rots, it will sort of, you know, get a little mulch.

01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:02.826
Do you think that's part of the performance piece?

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:07.623
Interesting.

01:10:10.584 --> 01:10:13.921
What happened to you?

01:10:13.921 --> 01:10:15.507
You know, we're usually in the Hamptons this time of the year,

01:10:16.924 --> 01:10:18.845
but the traffic is awful.

01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:20.137
-Tell me more about your face in this... -Look at mine.

01:10:20.137 --> 01:10:22.014
Oh, the man is brilliant.

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.932
The novel's calledTrash. It's about a guy named Travis and guy named Ash.

01:10:23.932 --> 01:10:26.978
You need a whitening session.

01:10:26.978 --> 01:10:28.605
Is there anyone who would like to read or perform up here?

01:10:28.605 --> 01:10:32.151
-Uh, he hasn't gone. -Yes. Him.

01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.487
David, is everything all right?

01:10:35.071 --> 01:10:36.948
What did you do to your beard?

01:10:36.948 --> 01:10:38.992
-I shaved-- -It's part of his piece.

01:10:41.954 --> 01:10:43.457
Okay, everyone.

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:47.002
We know his wife very well.

01:10:47.002 --> 01:10:48.961
The astounding novelist J.M. Lee.

01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:51.965
It turns out that her husband also writes.

01:10:51.965 --> 01:10:54.010
Please welcome David Lee.

01:11:03.313 --> 01:11:06.734
Thank you. Uh...

01:11:06.734 --> 01:11:07.984
Actually it's not David Lee.

01:11:07.984 --> 01:11:11.988
It's David Warwik. J.M. Lee is my wife.

01:11:12.072 --> 01:11:15.744
Uh, it's a common mistake.

01:11:15.744 --> 01:11:20.999
Jennifer and I are really honored to be invited to this artist salon.You know, to spend time with all of you artists.

01:11:20.999 --> 01:11:24.002
Uh, we drove up here

01:11:24.378 --> 01:11:27.132
and we got into an argument

01:11:28.007 --> 01:11:30.009
because I forgot to bring the wine.

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:33.013
You know, it's one of those arguments where

01:11:33.013 --> 01:11:35.141
you're talking about one thing

01:11:36.016 --> 01:11:37.645
but you actually are arguing about something totally different.

01:11:37.645 --> 01:11:39.355
And we've just been really kind of distant with each other.

01:11:39.355 --> 01:11:43.067
Like, we haven't had sex in forever.

01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:46.028
So, on the ride up,

01:11:46.028 --> 01:11:47.573
we decided to pull over and have sex in the car.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.036
But the police came, and they stopped us,

01:11:52.036 --> 01:11:55.999
and they called me Roadfucker,

01:11:55.999 --> 01:11:57.626
which was unfortunate.

01:11:57.626 --> 01:11:59.043
So, once we pulled into Greenwich,

01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:00.463
that's when we learnt that you can't buy wine

01:12:00.463 --> 01:12:03.299
in Greenwich on a Sunday.

01:12:03.299 --> 01:12:04.927
Not after 5:00.

01:12:04.927 --> 01:12:06.094
Right. Yes. So...

01:12:06.094 --> 01:12:08.053
We then drove back to New York,

01:12:08.053 --> 01:12:10.099
we saw a convenience store like a Quick Mart,

01:12:10.099 --> 01:12:12.811
and I saw some wine that was like a wine product

01:12:12.811 --> 01:12:16.691
which I didn't even know that a the thing,

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:18.442
So, I was like let's just get this. It's cheap, it's fine.

01:12:18.442 --> 01:12:22.070
And she got mad and then she left.

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:25.073
She just stormed out.

01:12:25.073 --> 01:12:26.827
And the thing about Jennifer, is that Jennifer doesn't own a cell phone.

01:12:26.827 --> 01:12:29.998
She doesn't believe in 'em, which... that's great for her.

01:12:29.998 --> 01:12:33.376
But it means that I don't know how to get in touch with her.

01:12:33.376 --> 01:12:35.754
And I got really worried.

01:12:35.754 --> 01:12:39.592
And the police, they told me it was probably okay. And he told me that I should come here.

01:12:39.592 --> 01:12:41.761
And that she'd probably show up and she hasn't.

01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:44.264
And I called the cops.

01:12:44.264 --> 01:12:45.891
And they're not even looking for her. At all.

01:12:45.891 --> 01:12:49.729
And instead of finding her myself or trying,

01:12:49.895 --> 01:12:53.942
I had to spend my whole evening with you assholes.

01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:01.993
You!

01:13:01.993 --> 01:13:03.161
You're a handsome dilettante.

01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:05.956
And if I had to spend any time

01:13:05.956 --> 01:13:08.292
in Italian monastery with you,

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:10.377
I would murder myself and I'd pin it on you.

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:14.633
And then you!

01:13:15.132 --> 01:13:16.384
You are a monk with some serious mommy issues, man.

01:13:16.384 --> 01:13:20.098
Like, you really need to stop projecting through your art.

01:13:20.098 --> 01:13:23.267
You put boobs over everything.

01:13:23.267 --> 01:13:24.645
Get it checked out. Talk to somebody.

01:13:24.645 --> 01:13:26.981
Start a podcast or something.

01:13:26.981 --> 01:13:28.816
And you!

01:13:28.816 --> 01:13:30.818
You're... You're a dentist. But you know what?

01:13:31.027 --> 01:13:33.947
Your book idea...

01:13:34.238 --> 01:13:36.992
it's ten times better than anything Eric Windbag could come up with.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.539
-Thank you. -That's... It's Windbed.

01:13:41.539 --> 01:13:44.417
I know.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:45.710
And you know what, you're right.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.463
I probably do need a teeth whitening.

01:13:47.463 --> 01:13:50.173
-Call me. -I will. Thank you.

01:13:50.173 --> 01:13:52.385
And you. You, sir. You're a critic.

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:56.556
And, oh, you think you know everything.

01:13:56.556 --> 01:13:58.851
Oh, I should change my name to something metal-sounding

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:02.187
because that will move books?

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:04.189
Fuck you, man.

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:06.527
And you, Charles.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:09.195
So, good to see you, buddy.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:11.197
Look at you, the big successful book editor

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.994
who just gets off on tearing other people down

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:17.204
because you were never a writer.

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:19.126
You never cared about writing.

01:14:19.126 --> 01:14:20.668
And you, this woman. Be careful of this woman.

01:14:21.377 --> 01:14:25.174
You're like a nympho lit-agent.

01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:27.592
She tried to choke me, and all of this,

01:14:27.592 --> 01:14:30.430
I didn't do, that's her.

01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:32.182
And you,

01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:34.934
you were amazing, man.

01:14:36.145 --> 01:14:38.689
You were great. It was beautiful.

01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:41.232
Thank you.

01:14:41.232 --> 01:14:42.360
And Lily and Bernard, this place is the shit.

01:14:43.154 --> 01:14:46.866
That pool, under different circumstances,

01:14:46.866 --> 01:14:49.952
would have been a great time.

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.579
I was honestly so...

01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:56.752
nervous about coming here

01:14:57.377 --> 01:14:59.714
and trying to impress you people.

01:14:59.714 --> 01:15:01.883
And at the end of the day, I don't give a shit.

01:15:01.883 --> 01:15:04.259
I don't give a shit about what you all think about me, 'cause it doesn't matter.

01:15:04.259 --> 01:15:07.263
I don't care if you read my writing, or if you like my writing,

01:15:07.263 --> 01:15:10.266
because I didn't write it for any of you.

01:15:10.266 --> 01:15:13.189
I wrote it for myself.

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:15.191
And that's all it matters. If at the end of the day,

01:15:15.191 --> 01:15:17.985
all I am, is just J.M. Lee's husband.

01:15:19.028 --> 01:15:22.280
That's fine,

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.283
As long as I get to write, that's all I care about.

01:15:28.915 --> 01:15:32.211
Jennifer.

01:15:33.754 --> 01:15:36.965
Hi.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.425
I brought wine.

01:15:39.928 --> 01:15:42.055
It's... a Pinot noir.

01:15:42.055 --> 01:15:44.724
This is... this is a lovely, lovely home.

01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:05.207
I'm so sorry.

01:16:18.889 --> 01:16:22.143
What?

01:16:22.143 --> 01:16:23.352
I read your book.

01:16:23.937 --> 01:16:24.980
And?

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.357
It's terrible.

01:16:45.087 --> 01:16:48.967
Hello. If everyone would please take their seats.

01:16:48.967 --> 01:16:52.345
We're about to start the reading.

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:53.638
Thank you.

01:16:55.389 --> 01:16:56.684
Please help me in welcoming tonight's author

01:16:56.684 --> 01:16:59.437

01:17:07.864 --> 01:17:11.200
Thank you.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.619
Um, this is from my first novel,

01:17:12.785 --> 01:17:16.290
Orange Summer.

01:17:27.178 --> 01:17:30.765

Every Tuesday, 4:30.

01:20:33.186 --> 01:20:35.189
They'll be here.

01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:36.566
I got a signed book, I got a notebook full of notes.

01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:38.568
Jealous.

01:20:39.651 --> 01:20:41.280
It's rude.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.654
I've read this book five times.

01:20:42.654 --> 01:20:44.657
I've had conversations with the author.

01:20:44.657 --> 01:20:46.869
I know the book.

01:20:47.327 --> 01:20:48.496
And they know I know the book.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:55.087
You know, when DeMarco was all excited about that Tony Morrison thing,

01:20:55.296 --> 01:20:58.673
we all came.

01:20:58.673 --> 01:20:59.717
Hey, Patterson,

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:01.803
uh, me and Dressler are here at book club.

01:21:01.803 --> 01:21:04.680
Uh, wonder if you're coming tonight.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.726
Patty at the drop office kid had a soccer game.

01:21:06.726 --> 01:21:08.936
- Bullshit - She's coming.

01:21:08.936 --> 01:21:11.231
Bullshit.

01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:14.611
It's unbelievable. It's like, there's no... No sense of etiquette.

01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:18.448
This is like, this is like the breakdown of society.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.660
She's got talent.

01:21:22.785 --> 01:21:24.246
Her husband's a deadbeat, though.
